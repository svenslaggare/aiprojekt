[12:01] <holycow> danke
[12:01] <ITSa341> Anyone got any advice on an EVDO ( cellular ) card for use in Ubuntu? I don't want to sign up for two years and buy a $100 card and find it won't work right.
[12:01] <Amaranth> kitche: *shrug* Just repeating what I've heard, I've never owned a geforce 2 of any kind
[12:01] <Hova> plaese help im trying to instal partimage-0.6.4-1    http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35664/
[12:01] <jmg> hi all
[12:01] <kitche> Stormx2: <area code>-<prefix>-<suffix>
[12:01] <jmg> i am having issues creating an lvm
[12:01] <holycow> mnoir, oh dude, this builds a deb?
[12:01] <Stormx2> kitche: How many digits in each?
[12:01] <mnoir> holycow: it is really a side effect but totally legit
[12:01] <mnoir> yes it does...
[12:01] <jmg> pvcreate works, but vgcreate wont add
[12:01] <ITSa341> Stormx2  3 3 4
[12:01] <holycow> mnoir, *blink* and *whoa*
[12:02] <ITSa341> Stormx2  (xxx) xxx-xxxx
[12:02] <holycow> mnoir, i have needed something like this for a while, i really hate doing all the package stuff manually
[12:02] <Amaranth> Stormx2: Use 712-258-5000
[12:02] <holycow> wow i really appreciate that
[12:02] <mnoir> it's purpose is to inject a non-distribution pkg into the std dist mgt set
[12:02] <jmg> root@zhadum:~# pvcreate /dev/sda3 Physical volume "/dev/sda3" successfully created
[12:02] <jmg> root@zhadum:~# vgcreate vm /dev/sda3 No physical volume label read from /dev/sda3
[12:02] <Amaranth> Stormx2: That's the weatherline in my city. Gives forecasts. :)
[12:02] <mnoir> i discovered it in ubuntu
[12:02] <Vich> you know how mac osx has that launcher thing at the bottom?
[12:02] <Vich> is there a similar thing for linux?
[12:02] <jmg> whats the deal?
[12:02] <mnoir> actually saw it in a forum... :)
[12:02] <Amaranth> Vich: That horrible thing called the Dock?
[12:02] <lubix> vich bsd
[12:02] <jmg> Vich: yes but i forget its name
[12:02] <holycow> mnoir, thanks dude, that helps a lot
[12:03] <holycow> Amaranth, -_-, indeed
[12:03] <holycow> i'm with you on that one
[12:03] <holycow> hehe :)
[12:03] <mnoir> main value to me is a clean uninstall, whatever the pkg has or doesn't for uninstall
[12:03] <mnoir> np :)
[12:03] <holycow> mnoir, i swear by dpkg, i refuse to do make-installs anymore
[12:03] <Stormx2> ITSa341: Still only 5gb, but thats okay. Thats more free space than I have over 120gb hard disks.
[12:04] <jmg> *stab*
[12:04] <philip_> just signed up, only got 5GB
[12:04] <Hova> C compiler cannot create executables,what dose this mean and what can i do
[12:04] <Amaranth> holycow: You will get stabbed in the face with a spoon if you use checkinstall
[12:04] <ITSa341> Stormx2   That's wierd, I signed up last week and got 50GB free
[12:04] <Amaranth> holycow: It's a total hack
[12:04] <nuked_omen> sancho, i'm waiting
[12:04] <Stormx2> Hova: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[12:04] <kitche> Hova: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[12:04] <Stormx2> snap!
[12:04] <sancho> nuked_omen: I sent it over private chat, but here it is again: sancho@sancho.sk
[12:04] <Hova> Thank you both
[12:05] <mnoir> holycow: I dunno if it will work for you - you need the make install for it to work i think.
[12:05] <mnoir> It was designed as a sneaky tool http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
[12:05] <Stormx2> ITSa341: Wheres the FF extension? ^__^
[12:05] <holycow> Amaranth, lol. hack in a very bad way or just bad enough that it doesn't create packages that should be publised yet they work?
[12:06] <tjb891> can anyone how to tell me how to upgrade from 6.06 without losing all my installed programs,settings, and home folder?
[12:06] <Amaranth> holycow: that second one
[12:06] <ITSa341> Stormx2   bbiam I'll find it for ya
[12:06] <Amaranth> holycow: no doubt it works on _your_machine
[12:06] <Amaranth> holycow: but on others....
[12:06] <Amaranth> back later, dinner
[12:06] <Stormx2> ITSa341: I had a look on addons.mozilla.org and came up blank

[12:07] <mnoir> upgrade
[12:07] <Thumper322> Hova: What's up with the C compiler?
[12:07] <ITSa341> Stormx2  https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1593/

[12:12] <ITSa341> J4kch  Sorry, I know nothing about their error messages, it has always just worked perfectly for me
[12:12] <J4kch> ITSa341: Alright, what country do you live in tho?
[12:12] <Hova> Software index is broken, ??
[12:12] <Hova> what do i do
[12:12] <ITSa341> Stormx2   It shows 50GB available still and I am using the free version from AOL
[12:12] <ITSa341> J4kch   USA
[12:13] <J4kch> ITSa341: That might have something to do with it
[12:13] <Stormx2> ITSa341: Its no big deal don't worry
[12:13] <J4kch> Stormx2: What country you in?
[12:13] <dogmeat> folks is it possible to repart a ext3/2 partition to reclaim drive space using free space for a new os install?
[12:13] <ITSa341> Stormx2  All my signup information showed 5gb but when I log in at the top it shows 50GB   hehehe  maybe it will for you when you get logged in also. :-)

[12:15] <dogmeat> mnoir: gparted would do it?
[12:15] <BlueLaguna> is there any package for vim-enhanced?
[12:15] <BlueLaguna> Basically, syntax highlighting for vim
[12:15] <mnoir> yes - i expected a factoid
[12:15] <mnoir> blue - the folks in #vim might (just a theory) know that
[12:15] <START21> has anyone been able to get wireless workong on the new ubuntu?
[12:16] <Stormx2> START21: what, 7.04?
[12:16] <lostinc> Can anyone tell me why my laptop (running edgy eft) fails to see the CDROM after being on all night?
[12:16] <regx> hi
[12:17] <START21> 6.10
[12:17] <BlueLaguna> mnoir: Yes...I know it exists, but I was wondering if it did for Ubuntu...
[12:17] <BlueLaguna> hence me asking in #ubuntu...
[12:17] <Stormx2> lostinc: try another CD...
[12:17] <lostinc> I have tried several CDrs
[12:17] <Stormx2> !wireless
[12:17] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:17] <START21> this is my first time using an operating system other than windows i finally got rid of my windows xp
[12:17] <Stormx2> Aah
[12:17] <lostinc> If i reboot there will be no probs
[12:17] <Stormx2> START21: See what ubotu just put? Have a look there...
[12:18] <Stormx2> lostinc: I have absolutely no idea. Maybe post on ubuntuforums.org or submit a bug?
[12:18] <START21> thanks ill monkey around with that
[12:18] <START21> if i get stuck ill ask for help i guess
[12:18] <lostinc> Okay Ill try that.
[12:18] <dogmeat> mnoir: thanks
[12:18] <Stormx2> START21: Yeah go ahead :)
[12:18] <Stormx2> asparagui: Why would it crash?
[12:18] <asparagui> did it again.
[12:19] <asparagui> and i got all the updates that time.
[12:19] <asparagui> anybody know how to read crash logs?
[12:19] <Jeeva> How can i see how long my pppoe connection has been active ?
[12:19] <Hoag> Hey all. Is there a way to check window names as they open and apply wmctrl changes to it automatically?

[12:19] <AdamKili> (hey I'm doing a 5 min presentation on linux) - Am I correct in assuming that quite a few features used in proprietary software were in free software first? (like maybe Firefox's tabbed browsing)
[12:20] <Stormx2> AdamKili: Yeah
[12:20] <Stormx2> AdamKili: Windows TCP/IP stack too.
[12:20] <apokryphos> AdamKili: I'm not sure which browser had it first, but Opera had tabs before Firefox, for sure
[12:20] <VGambit> uh
[12:20] <dxdt> AdamKili, the tabbed browsing thing gets hard.  I mean firefox had it before IE, but the original tab browsing concept goes back a really long time
[12:20] <apokryphos> and that's actually proprietary
[12:20] <VGambit> how do I upgrade from dapper to edgy?
[12:20] <apokryphos> VGambit: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic

[12:21] <Hova> ??
[12:21] <AdamKili> Then maybe tabbed browsing isn't a good example. Are there any really good examples anyone knows of?

[12:24] <okan> apokryphos, well if i cant ask question in ubuntu channel, where am i gonna ask ??
[12:24] <apokryphos> okan: it has direct+easy instructions on what to do
[12:24] <okan> apokryphos, ok i'll read that also thanx a lot
[12:24] <Valmarko>  when I do glxinfo |grep vendo ,   I get:
[12:24] <AdamKili> zambonie: ya that would be good

[12:25] <Valmarko> is it a problem?

[12:28] <reinhold_> Hi all! is there any way to get a package of the 2.6.18 or 2.6.19 Kernel for Edgy?
[12:28] <nemish> I'm having an odd problem with RAID and Edgy
[12:28] <nemish> if I boot using /dev/md0 it just sort of hangs there
[12:29] <Isyth> Well I've got a samsung E720 and an accompanying data cable (direct phone to USB). When I still ran windows, I could get a steering program for that from the samsung website, but there's no such thing for linux.
[12:29] <nemish> if I boot a non raid disk it boots fine and /dev/md0 initializes correctly
[12:29] <Stormx2> Isyth: There may be. What sort of things do you want to do? Copy files over, or syncronise stuff?
[12:29] <nemish> root=/dev/md0 md=0,/dev/sda1,/dev/sdb1
[12:29] <nemish> any ideas?
[12:30] <Isyth> Stormx2: I just want to get some pictures off the phone onto my computer
[12:30] <Valmarko> I understand.
[12:30] <Jeeva> How can i see how long my pppoe connection has been active ?
[12:32] <movi> ubuntu 6.10, trying to use the evdev driver for my mouse
[12:32] <movi> and i get
[12:32] <ITSa341>  Valmarko:  I have found answers or been pointed to the answers for almost every question I have asked here. Sometimes quickly, sometimes it takes a while.
[12:32] <Stormx2> Isyth: I ran a google on it. There may be software / kernel modules... I'm not sure. It took me a very long while to get my phone syncing.
[12:32] <movi> EE PreInit returned NULL for "Mouse0"
[12:32] <quappa> hello to all. people all over the net say that upstart in Edgy is on by default. how do I know if I run upstart? My startup times didn't change after upgrade.
[12:33] <Trini_Man> yeah i have a HTC tytn
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[12:33] <movi> i am pointing correctly to the event device for my mouse
[12:33] <Trini_Man> how do i sync that ?
[12:33] <J4kch> How do I upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 without screwing it up? =P
[12:33] <Trini_Man> lol
[12:34] <nemish> J4kch, what are you worried about?
[12:34] <dewnut> hello
[12:34] <J4kch> nemish, losing all my files
[12:34] <nemish> change your sources.list and then run apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:34] <nemish> should be fine
[12:35] <dewnut> can I ask general support questions in this channel?
[12:35] <nemish> i did the same thing when going from Breezy to Dapper w/o a hitch
[12:35] <Isyth> Stormx2, for bluetooth there seem to be some solutions...
[12:35] <M3G4crux> hi
[12:35] <J4kch> nemish, what do I change in sources.list?
[12:35] <Stormx2> Isyth: I saw that.
[12:35] <nemish> J4kch, change s/dapper/edgy/g
[12:35] <Trini_Man> how do i get my smartphone to mount in  Ubuntu
[12:36] <Stormx2> J4kch: He means change every instance of dapper to edgy, in case you don't speak powernerd :)
[12:36] <dewnut> I am getting the following error when trying to partition: ubuntu the ext3 file system creation in partion #1 of IDE1 Master failed
[12:36] <dewnut> anyone have any ideas?
[12:36] <J4kch> ah, alright
[12:36] <nemish> Stormx2, lol thanks sorry i forget sometimes
[12:36] <Sanne> J4kch: you may also want to look over this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[12:36] <AdamKili> zambonie: I want an example that says: "Linux did this first, and linux did it better!" An example that proprietary software users can relate to. Like here's a good one I just found on wikipedia: "Free software played a part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web" doesn't exactly say linux did this first and better, but I think I'll mention it anyway.
[12:37] <Stormx2> nemish: I just wanted to use the word powernerd. I love that word.
[12:37] <nemish> lol
[12:38] <nemish> so i've read posts that people with RAID in dapper had issues when upgrade to Edgy... but think was fixed... not 100% sure
[12:38] <J4kch> sanne: Thanks, that makes it much easier
[12:38] <Stormx2> AdamKili: Remember that its not just widgets and stuff. The first half decent C compilers were open source, and so forth. linux is just a kernel.
[12:38] <Sanne> J4kch: :)
[12:38] <nemish> but trying to make my sda a mirror i can't get it to boot.. starts splash but then can't find /dev/md0 to initialize
[12:39] <AdamKili> ya but not many people even have the slightest clue what a C compiler is...
[12:39] <nemish> but if it can't find /dev/md0 it has no chance of reading /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf so i'm kinda lost as to how to get around this?
[12:39] <Stormx2> AdamKili: What is the info for?
[12:39] <J4kch> What's a C compiler???
[12:39] <nemish> if i boot off disk in the mirror ie. root=/dev/sdb1 then i can't correctly initialize the mirror :(
[12:39] <Sanne> J4kch: a word of caution: back up your data! :)
[12:39] <J4kch> I don't have the slightest clue
[12:39] <dyzlex> Can someone help me dual boot Ubuntu 6.06 with Windows XP Pro x64 over PM please? I have Ubuntu installed on a primary 4gb partition, and I have an empty NTFS partition I want to install XP Pro on
[12:40] <nemish> any help would be really appreciated here
[12:40] <J4kch> sanne: You tell me NOW?
[12:40] <ITSa341> Stormx2  wasn't sendmail designed for *nix and most email based on it?
[12:40] <nuked_omen> a c compiler is a computer program that translates C code readable by humans to machine code (readable by the computer)
[12:40] <Stormx2> ITSa341: Yeah that sort of thing.
[12:40] <Sanne> J4kch: do I really *have* to tell you?
[12:40] <J4kch> I'd rather not have to backup anything
[12:40] <ITSa341> Stormx  lol  Only example I could think of quick  LOL
[12:41] <TLE> Hey guys, can you throw me a hint on how to downgrade a package with apt ?
[12:41] <nemish> J4kch, i wouldn't be doing this inside of X
[12:41] <nuked_omen> J4kch, i wish you lose your data
[12:41] <nemish> i would exit to shell and run from there
[12:41] <Sanne> J4kch: it is always a good idea to back up. You are responsible for your data. But you decide, of course :).
[12:41] <J4kch> Brb
[12:41] <Stormx2> what is J4kch doing then?
[12:41] <dyzlex> Can anyone help me? Please?
[12:41] <zambonie> AdamKili: there are 'things' that were done better proprietarily than os, and vice versa.  i just dont know how you are going to weigh them and come to a definitive verdict.
[12:42] <taeko> J4kch: do not listen to nemish, just run sudo "update-manager -c" under X
[12:42] <Stormx2> dyzlex: Install XP. Then recover grub.
[12:42] <AdamKili> I'm giving a 5 min presentation about linux, to people my age (~15), who don't know that much about computers
[12:42] <nuked_omen> zambonie, linux is about freedom of choice
[12:42] <dyzlex> Stormx2: Thanks
[12:42] <nemish> Stork, i just hope not inside gnome-terminal.. cause with how much changes that's gonna be messy
[12:42] <nemish> sorry that was meant for Stormx2
[12:43] <Stormx2> AdamKili: Oh man, don't be all cocky saying "linux did it first". Just show em what it can do. Show em how fast it is, showcase all the office stuff, then flip open UT (that'll turn some heads)
[12:43] <ITSa341> AdamKili  for ~15 age group just mention Myspace and YouTube and mp3's with NO spyware or virus and they will get a good idea they should check out linux
[12:43] <Stormx2> Yeah
[12:43] <Stormx2> never having to worry about computer being slow
[12:43] <Stormx2> or viruses
[12:43] <nuked_omen> yo, use some glx/compiz effects.. people will love it
[12:43] <nemish> taeko, you don't think with the gnome upgrades and stuff that it wouldn't get really "busted"
[12:43] <Stormx2> Yeah XGL
[12:43] <Stormx2> Spin that baby
[12:44] <J4kc1> Back
[12:44] <ITSa341> Cube effect and wobbly will win some votes
[12:44] <nuked_omen> xgl, right
[12:44] <ITSa341> Anyone got any advice on an EVDO ( cellular ) card for use in Ubuntu? I don't want to sign up for two years and buy a $100 card and find it won't work right.
[12:45] <ITSa341> Has anyone here even tried cellular internet access with an Ubuntu laptop?
[12:45] <holycow> its best to google that ITSa341 and check the wiki
[12:45] <Stormx2> Be careful to say how easy it is to install, and make sure you say Windows and ubuntu can co-exist.
[12:45] <holycow> its hard to remember specific device information
[12:45] <kingrayray> Lol.. Installing Ubuntu is so ridiculously simple that it's almost comical
[12:45] <nuked_omen> for ~15 year-old tell em they can hack anything with linux, they'll luv it
[12:45] <kingrayray> I love it :D
[12:46] <nemish> ITSa341, i've done PCMCIA aircard
[12:46] <Stormx2> kingrayray: Good to hear it :)
[12:46] <Hova> can some one show me a good site for installing xgl.sh
=== RvGaTe709 is now known as RvGaTe
[12:46] <apokryphos> Hova: .sh?
[12:46] <AdamKili> whoa stem the flow of excellent ideas for a sec! Stormx: whats UT? nuked_omen: what are glx/compiz effects? (I, myself have only been using ubuntu for about a month now)
[12:46] <Stormx2> Aah this channel is so nice tonight. You get some complete dalnetters in here in the morning.
[12:46] <nuked_omen> installing ubuntu is a lot easier and faster than xp
[12:46] <ITSa341> holycow   I found some stuff but nothing like talking to someone who has used it and can tell me their personal opinion. I'm moving to a place 45 minutes to the nearest 7-11 or McDonalds so my options are dial-up, satellite, or cellular.
[12:46] <kingrayray> I'm installing Edgy on my G3 iMac right now :-)
[12:46] <J4kc1> It's night here
[12:46] <cmt^^> nuked_omen - unless you have an ati card
[12:46] <cmt^^> 8)
[12:46] <Stormx2> AdamKili: Unreal Tournament. Runs on linux fine... installers and everything
[12:46] <ITSa341> nemish  I'm using a broadcom at 54mbps now   :-)
[12:46] <Hova> xgl.sh
[12:46] <nuked_omen> AdamKili, you got a lot to learn
[12:47] <apokryphos> cmt^^: ATI cards should still of course work out of the box, they just won't have the accelerated drivers installed
[12:47] <Stormx2> AdamKili: You got a newish PC?
[12:47] <apokryphos> Hova: once again, xgl.sh? What are you talking about?
[12:47] <Stormx2> AdamKili: Or whatever your doing the presentation on?
[12:47] <holycow> ITSa341, i wish i could help on that specific one, i just don't have any info on it
[12:47] <nuked_omen> cmt^^, i agree, never used ati cards, but i hear they can be a pain in the butt
[12:47] <nemish> ITSa341, cool
[12:47] <cmt^^> apokryphos - they didn't for me
[12:47] <Hova> apokryphos:i want to install xgl
[12:47] <apokryphos> cmt^^: what happened?
[12:47] <Hova> or beryl
[12:47] <apokryphos> Hova: why did you say xgl.sh then?
[12:47] <cmt^^> had to manually alter xorg.conf to get it working, and being a total linux-newbie it wasn't that self-explanatory
[12:47] <apokryphos> !xgl | hova

[12:48] <Hova> apokryphos:i thout it was called that sorry
[12:48] <apokryphos> cmt^^: again, what happened? Blank screen?
[12:48] <nuked_omen> i suggest you don't show ubuntu to them if you don't feel confident using it then
[12:48] <AdamKili> Stomx2: linky? umm...~2 Ghrz laptop with a NVIDIA card, it ran Halo fine when I used to have windows
[12:48] <cmt^^> apokryphos - the installation froze just before starting X
[12:48] <cmt^^> or actually _when_ starting X
[12:48] <Stormx2> AdamKili: Oh it'll work then... UT and XGL
[12:48] <cmt^^> with no error message

[12:49] <mamonassassina> (in the howto there)
[12:49] <nemish> ITSa341, Sprint PCMCIA card wasn't that bad.. i still haven't gotten my Sprint Phone as Modem to work right... starts initialization over BT but then dies...
[12:49] <holycow> nforce is a terrible chipset to get if you want out of the box support
[12:49] <holycow> :/
[12:49] <holycow> *grrrr*
[12:49] <mamonassassina> but the problem doesn't magically vanish :P
[12:49] <ITSa341> nemish, do you remember what pcmcia card?
[12:49] <AdamKili> no i don't think i've ever played it

[01:23] <LjL> x-r00t-x: no
[01:23] <niekie> x-r00t-x, nope =\
[01:23] <Some_Person> Ubuntu > Windows
[01:23] <NineTeen67Comet> DARKGuy: grin .. they ca-rapped .. I made a powerpoint slide show for them and made the icon HUGE on their desktop .. I made it PDF full screen so they had no choice but to read the basics of Linux before they got too far .. They weren't happy for the first day, then they were like .. Oh man, this is so much faster, and I didn't know Linux had Lime Wire .. and it plays all my movies, DVD's and look at that! My windows wobble ..
[01:23] <w3ccv> cyber_brain_mfkg, rm -rf <dirname>
[01:23] <J4kc1> x-r00t-x, I feel like picking on you: Nope
[01:23] <x-r00t-x> Some_Person,  you mean to say ubuntu costly more than windows
[01:23] <niekie> x-r00t-x, in both meanings of the word free, not all Linux software is free. ;)
[01:24] <cyber_brain_mfkg> Wyld: lives
[01:24] <x-r00t-x> maybe i am not sure :D

[01:24] <Wyld> ohhh
[01:24] <cyber_brain_mfkg> w3ccv: thanx
[01:24] <Some_Person> i like ubuntu because it uses little memory when running
[01:24] <NineTeen67Comet> Hopefully they'll all be happy campers now .. I also pointed them to crossover office so they can if they have to install some MS stuff (I recently found out that not all Math stuff translates back to MS Word) ..
[01:24] <Wyld> thanks
[01:24] <Crazysam> hello everyone, i have a question
[01:25] <J4kc1> nineteen67comet: Someone told me what beryl is, what about the other stuff?
[01:25] <Some_Person> windows (especially vista, which i have) uses a lot of memory
[01:25] <ubun> how can i check how much ram is being used currently?
[01:25] <w3ccv> Crazysam, we cna't answer if you dont ask it
[01:25] <DARKGuy> NineTeen67Comet: Ahahaha *grin* awesome xD yeah... some people don t like to read, overall when they're already used to do stuff in Windoze (I haven't even read a Linux book except Linux Programming Fundaments (I dunno, it's in Spanish)) but I'm progressing nicely, then again good to know thye moved :) (weird about that crossover math word oO)
[01:25] <bimberi> ubun: 'free' in a terminal
[01:25] <Crazysam> can i change the resolution to higher than 1280:1040?
[01:25] <LjL> ubun: not as easy to answer as one would expect. try "free", but interpreting the numbers can be sort of tricky
[01:25] <ubun> there's no gnome app to do it?
[01:26] <LjL> ubun: gnome-system-monitor, most likely, or whatever it's called
[01:26] <x-r00t-x> hi guys . i cant login to anything when firestarter is runing . help me?
[01:26] <NineTeen67Comet> J4kc1: AIXGL is built into the new xorg .. if you go 6.06 you'll have to use XGL on top of xorg .. no biggie but AIXGL works a little better on slower machines .. beryl is also the new compiz .. compiz and beryl are very similar in performance and all this stuff is seriously Alpha right now .. always changing and breaks on occasion ..
[01:26] <bimberi> ubun: system -> admin -> system monitor
[01:26] <kitche> x-r00t-x: do you mean when you have the gui up?
[01:26] <ubun> thanks
[01:26] <x-r00t-x> kitche,  yes
[01:26] <J4kc1> nineteen67comet: Sounds great!
[01:26] <NineTeen67Comet> J4kc1: if you have questions you can also peek in #ubuntu-xgl .. that's the channel for this stuff ..
[01:26] <NineTeen67Comet> They are usually helpful in there too ..
[01:27] <J4kc1> usually...
[01:27] <Crazysam> can i change the resolution to higher than 1280:1040?

[01:27] <ubun> wow, ubuntu + xchat + terminal + gaim + firefox with 3 tabs open is only using 137mb

[01:27] <NineTeen67Comet> J4kc1: you can go here for some install info on aixgl/beryl stuff .. http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[01:27] <ubun> firefox alone in windows takes that much ram :/
[01:28] <kitche> x-r00t-x: well it shouldn't effect any of your logins unless you saved your iptables config
[01:28] <J4kc1> nineteen67comet: Need to finish upgrading to Edgy first
[01:28] <nikosapi> hello, im using a recent nvidia card and the refresh rate is stuck at 50Hz and it really hurts my eyes, what must I add to my xorg.conf to fix this?
[01:29] <wylde> should i use gz or bz2 when downloading tars?
[01:29] <anurag_> bz2
[01:29] <NineTeen67Comet> cyber_brain_mfkg: Is LiVES similar to Cinnelerra ? .. I could never figure that out ..
[01:29] <kitche> wylde: doesn't matter
[01:29] <wylde> ok
[01:29] <wylde> thanks
[01:29] <nikosapi> wylde: what ever you like bz2 compresses better
[01:29] <NineTeen67Comet> J4kc1: there is also a site like that one that is for Dapper ..
[01:29] <NineTeen67Comet> J4kc1: Dapper just doesn't have the AIXGL stuff build in ..
[01:30] <whatspy> hi, any suggestion for a good text-based alternative to msn-messenger? if any, I'd like one that offers a distinct 'session' for each conversation...
[01:30] <cyber_brain_mfkg> NineTeen67Comet:  newer tried Cinnelerra
[01:30] <whatspy> the equivalent of the msn windows, I mean
[01:30] <wylde> nikoapi: you mean smaller, or sith less errors?
[01:30] <AdamKili> help! how do i fix this error message with compiz: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[01:30] <J4kc1> nineteen67comet: Aight
[01:30] <kitche> whatspy: only text-based one that I know of is tmsnc which isn't being developed anymore
[01:30] <NineTeen67Comet> respect ..
[01:30] <x-r00t-x> kitche, i cant login without gui :( maybe problem on iptables
[01:31] <cyber_brain_mfkg> NineTeen67Comet: only i know is that there are 2 versions(2 diferent teamz of devoleperz)
[01:31] <wylde> nikoxpi: you mean smaller, or with less errors?
[01:31] <kitche> x-r00t-x: no that's probably due to a pam issue
[01:31] <wylde> nikospi: you mean smaller, or with less errors?
[01:31] <wylde> wow
[01:31] <wylde> i cna't spel
[01:31] <kitche> AdamKili: that's more of a warning you using the open source ati?
[01:31] <nikosapi> wylde: I've never had any problems with gz or bz2 but bz2 compresses files much smaller
[01:31] <x-r00t-x> kitche, how do i fix it?
[01:31] <J4kc1> Wylde: Lawl
[01:31] <LjL> whatspy, kitche: centericq supports MSN as well

[01:33] <BlueLaguna> is there a nologin shell under Ubuntu?
[01:33] <BlueLaguna> I assume there is...
[01:33] <LjL> x-r00t-x: i told you, i don't use firestarter, nor plan to install it since it's a Gnome app
[01:33] <BlueLaguna> or just something similar
[01:33] <AdamKili> kitche: i don't know. how do i tell? I just barely installed compiz, did compiz --replace in the terminal, then did compiz <compiz  theme file> --replace, and it gave that error message and the bar at the top of my windows dissappeared.
[01:33] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  its problem with iptables
[01:33] <w3ccv> g0tw00d, df shows mounts and spaces, mount shows mount data
[01:33] <J4kc1> Oh god, I forgot if I have nVidia or ATI
[01:33] <NineTeen67Comet> off to feed the offspring .. take care all .. thanks for you'all's help ..
[01:33] <g0tw00d> w3ccv: do that at terminal?
[01:34] <kitche> boojit: AdamKili see what driver your using by look at your xorg.conf it's in /etc/X11
[01:34] <anurag_> AdamKili, which video card?
[01:34] <LjL> x-r00t-x: actually kitche said it's more likely a problem with pam, didn't he?
[01:35] <g0tw00d> w3ccv: nm
[01:35] <x-r00t-x> yes LjL  but what is pam?
[01:35] <g0tw00d> w3ccv: tyvm
[01:35] <w3ccv> g0tw00d, yes
[01:35] <J4kc1> How do I check my hardware?
[01:35] <AdamKili> 1 sec..
[01:35] <LjL> x-r00t-x: like i knew. the acronym means pluggable authentication module i think
[01:35] <ChrisBradley> btw - I'm impressed with the Xsane - it works well with my F300 scanner

[01:36] <J4kc1> Don't cry
[01:36] <J4kc1> Google it =)
[01:37] <cmt^^> anyone here uses gmplayer?
[01:37] <wylde> !anyone
[01:37] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[01:37] <w3ccv> cmt^^, yes on FC4
[01:37] <J4kc1> I use normal mplayer
[01:38] <cmt^^> on startup, it says "Cannot load bitmap font: /usr/local/share/mplayer/font/font.desc
[01:38] <kitche> J4kc1: gmplayer is normal mplayer just means graphical mplayer which is normal
[01:38] <cmt^^> I put all the fonts there, but how do I build font.desc?
[01:38] <J4kc1> kitche: Ohhh! The more you know...
[01:38] <w3ccv> cmt^^, dono the problem, l think you're missing a font.  everyghing works here
[01:38] <cmt^^> w3ccv - you have a font.desc though, right?
[01:39] <Wyld> what is this "make" command?
[01:39] <anurag_> J4kc1, which video card you have
[01:39] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  i removed firestarter now i can do anything :D
[01:39] <cmt^^> the installation via synaptic missed the fonts and the skins, had to install them manually
[01:39] <cmt^^> the player is working, but the errormessage is annoying
[01:39] <J4kc1> anurag: GeForce FX 5200
[01:39] <J4kc1> anurag: It's nvidia
[01:39] <Pacifist> I'm trying to install ubuntu, but it got stuck saying: "Id 1 respawning too fast: disabled fpr 5 minutes" and similar lines to that (with the number chaning), how do I fix?
[01:40] <EdLin> Wyld: apt-get install build-essential
[01:40] <anurag_> J4kc1, lol okay
[01:40] <Wyld> EdLin: what does it do?
[01:40] <x-r00t-x> J4kc1, i have it before :P
[01:40] <J4kc1> anurag_: Forgot your underscore -_-
[01:40] <EdLin> Wyld: compile programs that use a Makefile to speed up or configure compilation
[01:40] <anurag_> J4kc1, i use AiXGL on two monitors
[01:40] <AdamKili> kitche, anurag_: Intel Corporation 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device?
[01:41] <J4kc1> anurag_: I don't even know what AiXGL
[01:41] <EdLin> Wyld: considering that including the universe repository there are over 15,000 packages in Ubuntu you shouldn't need make to compile much.
[01:41] <J4kc1> anurag_: I intend to find out once I finish Edgy upgrade though
[01:41] <kitche> AdamKili: but what does the driver part say
[01:41] <anurag_> J4kc1, uprade from ?
[01:41] <anurag_> J4kc1, dapper -> edgy ?
[01:41] <w3ccv> cmt^^, sri for the delay phone call. gmplayer works here without any messages, so I've never had the need to fix it.
[01:41] <cmt^^> kitche - you seem to know your way around, any ideas that would solve my 'font.desc'-problem?
[01:41] <Jeeva> how do i use windows again in shell
[01:41] <J4kc1> anurag_: 6.06 to 6.10, yes
[01:42] <AdamKili> kitche: i810
[01:42] <cmt^^> w3ccv - do you or don't you have a font.desc in the font-dir?
[01:42] <cmt^^> :)
[01:42] <anurag_> J4kc1, haha suffer ;-)
[01:42] <J4kc1> anurag_: Why do you say that?
[01:42] <Wyld> EdLin: so 'make' turns the code into something that ubuntu can use?
[01:42] <kitche> AdamKili: you using xgl?
[01:42] <ubun> when will firefox2.0 be in the repositories?
[01:42] <w3ccv> cmt^^, locate doesn't  even show it on the sytem
[01:42] <anurag_> J4kc1, i heard there was an problem with upgrading from dapper to edgy
[01:42] <EdLin> Wyld: it can
[01:43] <anurag_> J4kc1, :P
[01:43] <J4kc1> anurag_: Oh, probably the whole xerver-xorg thing
[01:43] <EdLin> Wyld: it's prefered to use apt-get or similar graphical tools like synaptic whenever possible
[01:43] <J4kc1> anurag_: I went to a website and they spoke of multiple problems and how to fix them
[01:43] <AdamKili> kitche: umm...i installed xserver-xgl package. Do i need to set it up?
[01:43] <kitche> AdamKili: i810 driver can't use XGL
[01:43] <Wyld> EdLin: I'm installing a video editing software, so it's not in the repositories,
[01:44] <J4kc1> anurag_: It wouldn't be very nice if I lost my 20GB of anime though...
[01:44] <Wyld> EdLin: i think
[01:44] <devnull_> hello .. i am trying to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 and it keeps complaining about disk space issues on /var/cache/apt/archives   when it is completely empty and i have more than enough freespace
[01:44] <AdamKili> kitche: so do i uninstall it? will the effects still work?
[01:44] <EdLin> Wyld: you have universe and multiverse enabled?
[01:44] <AdamKili> kitche: xgl i mean
[01:44] <EdLin> Wyld: it may also be in third-party repositories
[01:44] <Wyld> EdLin: never heard of them
[01:44] <EdLin> Wyld: then you don't have most of the programs available.
[01:44] <ubun> everything you can get with apt-get yo can get with synaptic by default right?
[01:45] <J4kc1> GUYS GUYS, should I stop the upgrade from Dapper to Edgy or continue???
[01:45] <EdLin> !repositories
[01:45] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[01:45] <J4kc1> Is it worth the risk?
[01:45] <devnull_> i would like to switch to edgy
[01:45] <ubun> does edgy have firefox 2?
[01:45] <anurag_> J4kc1, did i scared you :P
[01:45] <devnull_> ubun i believe so
[01:45] <J4kc1> anurag_: yes, you did =P
[01:45] <EdLin> ubun: yes
[01:46] <devnull_> that is one of my reasons for wanting to upgrade
[01:46] <J4kc1> anurag_: I am very touchy about my data, I have LOADS of important stuff that took me ages to get/do
=== _RvGaTe is now known as RvGaTe
[01:46] <AdamKili> kitche: so should i uninstall xserver-xgl? or how do i get it working?
[01:46] <EdLin> J4kc1: back up your data files before upgrading
[01:46] <EdLin> !upgrading
[01:46] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:46] <ubun> back up to dvd and/or external usb drive
[01:46] <J4kc1> EdLin: Everybody tells me that
[01:47] <ubun> i backup to my ipod shuffle but i dont have much to backup
[01:47] <EdLin> J4kc1: because it's true ;-)
[01:47] <J4kc1> EdLin: I can't backup 20GBs of information...
[01:47] <anurag_> J4kc1, :P
[01:47] <ubun> 20gb isnt that much
[01:47] <ubun> 5 DVDs :)
[01:47] <EdLin> J4kc1: then you've got to ask yourself, do you feel lucky. ;-)
[01:47] <devnull_> upgrade is asking for 180mb of free disk space and i have gigs ... why should this be failing for lack of disk space ?
[01:47] <J4kc1> Have there been any problems related to data loss?
[01:47] <J4kc1> I feel lucky, punk =P
[01:48] <ubun> or practice buddhist idea of non-attachment and let go of your porn/movies, having old stuff you've already seen just prevents you from seeing new stuff anyway, quit living in the past man!
[01:48] <anurag_> J4kc1, not till now, i guess it might
[01:48] <cmt^^> hmmm
[01:48] <J4kc1> anurag_: That's good news
[01:49] <ubun> my friend just daisy chains another harddrive and keeps all his important data on that so he can reinstall o/s's with out worrying
[01:49] <lonran> i am using ubuntu dapper and i want to update evolution to its last version, how can i do it?
[01:49] <ubun> cheaper than an external harddrive
[01:49] <J4kc1> anurag_: I always manage to screw up computers though, I screwed my Suse so I installed Ubuntu then I had to reinstall that
[01:49] <cmt^^> I changed the gui.conf to search for fonts in ~/.mplayer/font/ but the program still wanted to look for it in the /usr/share/mplayer/font-directory
[01:49] <cmt^^> how come?
[01:49] <J4kc1> !upgrade | lonran
[01:49] <ubotu> lonran: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:49] <regino> nadia habla espaol?
[01:50] <lonran> regino, yo
[01:50] <cmt^^> !es
[01:50] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[01:50] <J4kc1> regino, go to #ubuntu-es
[01:50] <regino> hola como estas?
[01:50] <devnull_> anurag me too
[01:50] <J4kc1> you guys are doing it too?
[01:50] <J4kc1> awesome
[01:50] <regino> thank j4kcl
[01:50] <jrib> !upgrade | anurag_, devnull_
[01:50] <ubotu> anurag_, devnull_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:50] <J4kc1> at least, I won't die alone
[01:50] <devnull_> i would like to but the upgrade dies
[01:51] <ubun> if your files are that important they should be backed up whether or not you plan on reinstalling, anything could happen, a broken harddrive, a script kiddie, a fire, the government..
[01:51] <lonran> ubotu, but i dont want to upgrade all the system, just evolution
[01:51] <cmt^^> any ideas?
[01:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about but i dont want to upgrade all the system, just evolution - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:51] <Wyld> EdLin: so how do i enable these universes you speek of?
[01:51] <anurag_> devnull_, J4kc1 have fun ;)
[01:51] <J4kc1> cmt^^: Reinstall ubuntu =P
[01:51] <cmt^^> J4kc1 - bah
[01:51] <devnull_> i read the upgrade instructions like 10 times
[01:51] <Wyld> !bot
[01:51] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[01:51] <devnull_> just trying to find out why it is dying
[01:52] <J4kc1> devnull_: Reinstall ubuntu too =P
[01:52] <devnull_> ?
[01:52] <J4kc1> That's my solution to everything to be honest...
[01:52] <anurag_> lol
[01:52] <devnull_> yea ... sounds like a windows solution
[01:52] <ubun> how come opera isn't in my synaptic?
[01:53] <devnull_> ubun idk ... i just download the deb from their site
[01:53] <J4kc1> jeruvy is mad
[01:53] <LjL> ubun: because it's a non-free program and as such cannot be put in the standard repositories
[01:53] <Jeruvy> J4kc1: is full of it
[01:53] <J4kc1> It's not free!?
[01:53] <J4kc1> I always used Opera for free...
[01:53] <ubun> i know opera makes money but i thought they were free
[01:53] <J4kc1> Unless, you mean the other free
[01:53] <AdamKili> help! I still can't get compiz working: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[01:53] <darksmiley> hey all, i just have a quick question =)
[01:54] <LjL> J4kc1: it's not free software, no
[01:54] <J4kc1> The two frees confuse me
[01:54] <anurag_> ubun, sudo apt-get install opera
[01:54] <ubun> guess ill try konquerer, since i've heard great things
[01:54] <LjL> and it used to be shareware anyway (though not anymore)
[01:54] <devnull_> i like firefox and opera over konquerer
[01:54] <ubun> i wanna keep my system 100% 'free' as possible
[01:54] <ubun> gotta support the free
[01:54] <J4kc1> Firefox owns all
[01:54] <Wyld> anem
[01:54] <Wyld> amen
[01:54] <ubun> i like firefox 2, just not < 2
[01:54] <Wyld> that is
[01:55] <kitche> AdamKili: sorry had to reboot real quick
[01:55] <devnull_> i like all versions but i would love to get 2 on here
[01:55] <ubun> if firefox had built in bittorrent client then opera wouldnt have anything on it
[01:55] <devnull_> fudge it
[01:55] <devnull_> i will just upgrade some other time
[01:55] <darksmiley> ubuntu has two ports open - 631 and 2208.  does anyone know what these are, if i need them and if and how i can close them?
[01:56] <darksmiley> hmm, that sucks anurag
[01:56] <darksmiley> anurag, have you tried updating from within synaptic?
[01:56] <x-r00t-x> kitche, i solved the problem :)
[01:56] <devnull_> opera's widgets are nifty
[01:56] <kitche> x-r00t-x: I seen before I had to reboot
[01:56] <ubun> which ones
[01:56] <AdamKili> oh you didn't ditch me? ;)
[01:56] <ubun> firefox's "scrap book" extention is awsome
[01:56] <kitche> AdamKili: nah my cd drive was full so it gave me many i/o errors
[01:57] <x-r00t-x> kitche,  oh i just uninstall firestarter :D
[01:57] <devnull_> whats scrap book ?
[01:57] <ubun> scrab book lets you save parts of a web page as like a bookmark
[01:57] <ubun> and a few other things
[01:57] <devnull_> nice .... google notebook ?
[01:57] <ubun> dunno i havent used google notebook yet
[01:57] <x-r00t-x> google notbook? what is that?
[01:57] <darksmiley> DOES ANYONE KNOW? ubuntu has two ports open - 631 and 2208.  does anyone know what these are, if i need them and if and how i can close them?
[01:57] <devnull_> go check it out
[01:57] <anurag_> J4kc1, what;s your status buddy
[01:57] <darksmiley> sorry that was to get people's attention!
[01:57] <darksmiley> hehe =)
[01:58] <devnull_> so the only recommended way to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 is through update-manager -c ?
[01:58] <jrib> devnull_: yes
[01:58] <LjL> darksmiley: cat /etc/services - 631 is CUPS web interface anyway
[01:58] <anurag_> darkmatter, I'm just trying out, whether it will work r not, for the community
[01:58] <devnull_> fudger
[01:58] <J4kc1> anurag_: 4 minutes for it to finish downloading
[01:58] <jrib> devnull_: why?
[01:58] <J4kc1> anurag_: How were you updating anyways?
[01:58] <devnull_> it keeps telling me i dont have enough diskspace
[01:59] <SinnerG> I have 2 hd's atm, 2nd one isnt used, is there a way to 'convert' those to raid0? Anyone know and if so : how?
[01:59] <J4kc1> devnull_: I'm doing the update-manager -c thing
[01:59] <devnull_> should be smooth
[01:59] <darksmiley> LjL, thanks i'm checking it out =)
[01:59] <anurag_> update-manager -c same stuff
[01:59] <shayan_> hey guys, i have  a screen that does 1400 x 1050, but im only getting 1024 x 768 in the screen resolution picker thing...
[02:00] <J4kc1> anurag_: Good good
[02:00] <devnull_> shayan you might need to reconfigure x
[02:00] <netman> hi , somebody have problem after update with gdm ?
[02:00] <jake> hello, I have screwed up my file perms for my windows partition and now it won't boot, can anyone help
[02:00] <devnull_> netman what problem ?
[02:00] <netman> i upgrade my system dapper to edgy
[02:00] <jrib> devnull_: how much space do you have left?
[02:00] <netman> only start manual
[02:00] <anurag_> J4kc1, devnull_ rofl here's an issue :P
[02:00] <J4kc1> netman: Here is a bunch of problems and their solutions: http://www.debianadmin.com/ubuntu-edgy-upgrade-common-problems-with-solutions.html
[02:00] <devnull_> on which drive .... on /var i have gigs, on /usr i have 1gig and /tmp is 1gig aswell
[02:00] <J4kc1> anurag_: Tell me the issue =P
[02:01] <ubun> is there a tool to view my windows partition from within linux? i'm pretty sure i read somewhere there was, i mount something...
[02:01] <harri3844> what is the little update tool near the time called?
[02:01] <devnull_> it says it only needs 180m
[02:01] <J4kc1> ubun: Some kind of virtual machine thing?
[02:01] <darksmiley> LjL... neither were on the list.  but you're right yeah i remember 631 is CUPS, so that's cool i'll leave that to it.  2208 comes up as "unknown" everywhere
[02:01] <ubun> j4kcl no just mountain my windows ntfs partition
[02:01] <Megaqwerty> Is there an "index now" feature for beagle?
[02:01] <ubun> *mounting
[02:01] <shayan_> hey guys, i have  a screen that does 1400 x 1050, but im only getting 1024 x 768 in the screen resolution picker thing, help appreciated!

[02:02] <ubun> thanks :)
[02:02] <Jeeva> i created a screen -S irssi, and ran IRSSI on it, how do i get back to my normal screen ?
[02:02] <Telroth_Plushie|> what jake said
[02:02] <ubun> even faster than google, you should get a benchmark award
[02:02] <cmt^^> anyone here tried ezquake with ubuntu?
[02:02] <J4kc1> what's ezquake?
[02:02] <AdamKili> Sorry I had to restart. No seriously. trying to get compiz to work WASN'T working
[02:02] <darksmiley> does anyone know what PORT 2208 is for?
[02:02] <devnull_> i really can't make any more space on /var so i hope it doesn't need over 1.3gigs of free space
[02:02] <kevinh90> hi
[02:02] <darksmiley> or how you can close ports?
[02:02] <GenNMX> !google port 2208
[02:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about google port 2208 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:03] <kitche> darksmiley: do a search the ports information is usually on the sites
[02:03] <cmt^^> Jeeva - you must have named your screen something, right?
[02:03] <J4kc1> anurag_: ONLY ONE MORE MINUTE TILL I LOSE ALL MY DATA AND CRASH LINUX!! =D
[02:03] <jake> to make the change permenant you could ad a line to /etc/fstab you can google examples
[02:03] <darksmiley> ok, thanks =)
[02:03] <Ramraid> Hey ppl Anyone know if feisty amd 64iso  supports intel emt 64
[02:03] <Megaqwerty> Is there an "index now" feature for beagle?
[02:03] <cmt^^> ie 'screen -S irc irssi'
[02:03] <anurag_> J4kc1, 15 mins left :P
[02:03] <harri3844> anyone know what the name of the little update tool in the system tray is called?
[02:03] <kevinh90> is there a way to install ubuntu without the ubuntu-desktop packages(no x, just text)
[02:03] <GenNMX> darksmiley: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%22port+2208%22&btnG=Search , possible ftp data port
[02:03] <J4kc1> anurag_: 30 secs
[02:03] <Jeeva> cmt^^: i'm in IRSSI already
[02:03] <jrib> harri3844: update-manager?
[02:04] <Jeeva> how do i get back to my other screen
[02:04] <jake> can anyone help me fix my windows file permissions?
[02:04] <cmt^^> well yeah
[02:04] <Megaqwerty> harri3844: update-manager?
[02:04] <Forgott3n> ok I have a quick question. For downloading a live 64-bit cd image... can that apply to 64-bit intel chips? or only AMD as mentioned?
[02:04] <harri3844> jrib: ill check it
[02:04] <darksmiley> thanks GenNMX =)
[02:04] <cmt^^> but when you do the screen-command next time
[02:04] <Megaqwerty> oh jrib got there first :)
[02:04] <LjL> darksmiley: 631 is on the list, though it refers to printing-something generically
[02:04] <cmt^^> do 'screen -S irc irssi'
[02:04] <J4kc1> anurag_: Okay, it's starting to install (AKA corrupting everything)
[02:04] <jake> I messed them up using Kubuntu
[02:04] <Jeeva> cmt^^: whats the diff ?
[02:04] <Jeeva> i made screen -S irssi
[02:04] <jrib> LjL: I think 631 is for the cups web interface?
[02:04] <AdamKili> so how can i fix compiz? here's the full error (not to long for the channel i hope): 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b compiz.real: No stencil buffer. Clipping of transformed windows is not going to be correct when screen is transformed.
[02:04] <anurag_> J4kc1, lol
[02:04] <darksmiley> yeah i decided i would leave 631 open, as i don't want to risk breaking ubuntu's printing system
[02:04] <LjL> jrib: indeed
[02:05] <harri3844> jrib: can I still use update-manager in kde?
[02:05] <darksmiley> and it's hardly a security problem
[02:05] <cmt^^> and then to detach press ctrl+a+d
[02:05] <harri3844> jrib: is there a kde version?
[02:05] <LjL> darksmiley: i don't have 2208 open by the way
[02:05] <cmt^^> to reattach do screen -r irc
[02:05] <Jeeva> cmt^^: thanks worked :)
[02:05] <Megaqwerty> Is there an "index now" feature for beagle?
[02:05] <cmt^^> 8)
[02:05] <darksmiley> wow really, it's not open when you portscan?
[02:05] <netman> J4kc1 thanks for url but my problem is not list on this page :S
[02:05] <J4kc1> Should I have this window open while installing Edgy?
[02:05] <jrib> harri3844: I don't see why not.  No I don't think there is a kde version.  But I don't use kde
[02:05] <J4kc1> netman: Alright, try asking some of the nerds in here =P
[02:05] <harri3844> jrib: ok thanks
[02:05] <nluh> Anyone here that could help me!?? I'm trying to install ubuntu (This is the first time using a linux distro) Is there a command-line that allows me to install without running live-desktop thingy from cd!?
[02:05] <netman> :)
[02:06] <jrib> nluh: you could use the alternate cd
[02:06] <netman> somebody have problem with gdm after update to edgy ?
[02:06] <nluh> what alternate cd?
[02:06] <AdamKili> nluh: not that i know of. I had to use the alternate cd like jrib said
[02:06] <netman> only start manually
[02:06] <nluh> I've downloaded only one cd
[02:06] <J4kc1> what's gdm anyways?
[02:06] <jrib> nluh: it is on the download page, let me know if you can't find it

[02:10] <nluh> What do u mean cmt^^
[02:10] <LjL> darksmiley: oh wait, i'm an idiot. i did the portscan while on SSH to my debian, not on ubuntu... :-\
[02:10] <jrib> netman: hmm it should start.  Where do you end up exactly?  In a terminal to log in?  Or do you get errors?
[02:10] <jaryn> did you check the md5 hash of the file
[02:10] <cmt^^> well
[02:10] <david____> wep+mschapv2+peap
[02:10] <cmt^^> you had an iso
[02:11] <devnull_> The upgrade aborts now. Please free at least 179M of disk space on /var/cache/apt/archives/. Empty your trash and remove temporary packages of former installations using 'sudo apt-get clean'.
[02:11] <J4kc1> nluh, Before starting live disk think, do md5sum check etc.
[02:11] <cmt^^> that you burned onto the cd
[02:11] <cmt^^> right?
[02:11] <darksmiley> LjL, hehe =D
[02:11] <jaryn> to make sure that it was a good download, wasn't corrupted
[02:11] <devnull_> ?
[02:11] <nluh> jaryn: I have no idea what u'r talking about.. md5?
[02:11] <cmt^^> you have to check that the file isn't corrupted
[02:11] <anurag_> J4kc1, md5sum oO
[02:11] <cmt^^> and using a tool called md5-hashing
[02:11] <david____> anyone VERY familar with wpa_upplicant?
[02:11] <LjL> darksmiley: yeah, it's open on ubuntu
[02:11] <kitche> !md5sum|nluh
[02:11] <ubotu> nluh: To verify the authenticity of a downloaded ISO image.  Command:  md5sum /path/to/file.iso Windows users: http://slavasoft.com and grab Fsum 2.51 or also check: http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/winmd5sum
[02:11] <J4kc1> anurag_: Where did the sum come from?
[02:11] <nluh> But i've downloaded the files from the ubuntu webpage
[02:11] <J4kc1> nluh, when you put in the CD
[02:11] <LjL> darksmiley: and the responsible process is hiodp
[02:12] <darksmiley> LjL, cool =)  how about 43065 if you netstat -l ?
[02:12] <cmt^^> sure, but you still have to check it before burning it
[02:12] <J4kc1> You get a menu right?
[02:12] <LjL> darksmiley: which is part of the hplip package
[02:12] <cmt^^> I downloaded the whole thing
[02:12] <cmt^^> from 3 different locations
[02:12] <darksmiley> LjL, hplip? printer again?
[02:12] <netman> jrib  gdm start do noghitng (blaknk screen) , i change to another terminal and /etc/init.d/gdm restart do the magic
[02:12] <cmt^^> and got them all wrong
[02:12] <zim> hi all is there a simple howto to get mp3 mpeg mov wmv etc to work

[02:12] <J4kc1> cmt^^: LOL! That's hilarious =P

[02:14] <DeamonminD> my serial modem Connects on startup how to disable its dialup in startup>?
[02:14] <darksmiley> LjL, firestarter will block it all though i think.  i'm being pedantic i know but after using slackware for a couple of years i'm used to having a very secure machine =)
[02:14] <david____> I installed entwork manager, wpa_supplicant, created an appropriate wpa_supplicant.conf file
[02:14] <jrib> Megaqwerty: yes, export BEAGLE_EXERCISE_THE_DOG=1   and then run beagled
[02:14] <david____> fired it all up
[02:14] <J4kc1> darksmiley: Real men use DOS
[02:14] <david____> and while I get verbose output
[02:15] <david____> I am not able to get an ip
[02:15] <david____> real men use knives
[02:15] <Megaqwerty> jrib: hm...but isn't beagled already running at default?
[02:15] <david____> and dead huuman skin
[02:15] <J4kc1> But you can't stab a OS =P
[02:15] <david____> yes you can
[02:15] <LjL> darksmiley: well i don't really care on this machine since it's behind a hardware firewall anyway, but i'm wondering about this 43998 port
[02:15] <J4kc1> Nu-huh
[02:15] <david____> the cds already havea hole and everything:D
[02:15] <jrib> Megaqwerty: yes, you may have to kill him

[02:21] <jrib> J4kc1: nope
[02:21] <J4kc1> jrib: Interesting...
[02:21] <Jeeva> can i install .rpm's ?
[02:21] <jrib> !rpm | Jeeva
[02:21] <ubotu> Jeeva: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[02:21] <J4kc1> Alien is DANGEROUS
[02:21] <Jeeva> bleh
[02:21] <jrib> Jeeva: are you trying to install a particular program?
[02:21] <Jeeva> yes
[02:21] <Jeeva> chillisoft.org

[02:22] <Jeeva> chillispot.org
[02:22] <Jeeva> even
[02:22] <J4kc1> Jeeva, you might be able to find a ubuntu alternative
[02:22] <Jeeva> there is source code
[02:22] <J4kc1> ugh, I hate source
[02:22] <anurag_> Jeeva, sudo apt-get alien
[02:22] <Megaqwerty> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35682/
[02:22] <J4kc1> You have to compile it and etc
[02:22] <anurag_> *install

[02:22] <J4kc1> Jeeva, name of program is?
[02:23] <Jeeva> www.chillispot.org

[02:23] <con-man> J4kc1: it does if you use it right!
[02:24] <con-man> J4kc1: :p
[02:24] <J4kc1> con-man: Psh
[02:24] <Jeeva> the older versions of chillisport had debian packages
[02:24] <Jeeva> but i want the latest, and it only has .rpm
[02:24] <J4kc1> con-man: What are your specs? Won't wine eat up a lot of stuff?
[02:24] <con-man> J4kc1: wine is harmless
[02:24] <con-man> J4kc1: and doesnt take up any resources
[02:24] <J4kc1> con-man: Says you =P
[02:25] <anurag_> con-man, more than 80% of winapp doesn't work under wine
[02:25] <LjL> J4kc1: and it's you who says the contrary. who are we to believe? :)
[02:25] <J4kc1> Cedega needs to be "free-er"
[02:25] <J4kc1> LjL: Good point =P
[02:25] <DeamonminD> jwai:my serial modem connects dial automatically when i boot.,. wat to do?
[02:25] <darksmiley> LjL, i wanted to try virus scanning just to much sure there's no funny business going on (reeeaaally unlikely i know, but 've never scanned before) and i have aegis installed... but i have no idea where it is
[02:25] <con-man> J4kc1 & anurag_:wine runs what i want it to run. for everything else there are linux versions of the programs
[02:25] <jrib> Jeeva: I would compile it
[02:26] <J4kc1> Anti-virus on Linux? Lol
[02:26] <LjL> darksmiley: dpkg -L aegis-virus-scanner
[02:26] <darksmiley> j4kcl, yeah i know, but i thought just in case there was anything strange going on it might pick it up
[02:26] <LjL> darksmiley: but perhaps you'd want to try something like rkhunter/chkrootkit as well
[02:26] <Jeeva> how do i compile again ?
[02:26] <Jeeva> just run make ?
[02:26] <jrib> ubotu: tell Jeeva about compiling
[02:27] <x-r00t-x> can anyone tell me how do i configure gprs via bluetooth?
[02:27] <jvai> deamonmind, u r on dial up? i cant help u there, if u want to connect the connection thru dial up, try firestarter firewall
[02:27] <Jeeva> last time i worked on unix was when i still used freebsd 4
[02:27] <darksmiley> LjL, i have aegis installed, but i can;t find the executable
[02:27] <J4kc1> Once Linux becomes mainstream and has most marketshare, there are going to be a LOT of viruses for it...
[02:27] <darksmiley> j4kcl... i beg to differ =)
[02:27] <LjL> darksmiley: the command i gave you will list all files, including the executable
[02:27] <darksmiley> LjL, how do i get hold of those programs?

[02:29] <darksmiley> LjL, thanks!

[02:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dualmonitor - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:30] <darksmiley> LjL, i understood the veeeery basic principles of apt-get and stuff, and also noticed that the ubuntu tools are just synaptic refined and fiddled with! lol
[02:30] <jrib> Megaqwerty: can you shutdown now, I having two beagled is probably not good

[02:32] <kitche> eletido: since your unregistered I can't answer you back in the pm
[02:32] <jrib> Megaqwerty: you could kill -9 but I don't know how well beagle will handle that (ie if it will get ocnfused when it starts up again)
[02:32] <Jeeva> jrib: thanks for link
[02:32] <LjL> darksmiley: "Add/Remove Programs" is based on Synaptic if that's what you mean, yeah. but Synaptic, Adept, apt-get, aptitude, etc, are all front-ends to the same APT backend anyway (well, with aptitude adding a bit of magic of its own). and ubuntu doesn't try to create an alternative to APT at all, it just uses APT and tries to give some "nice" "user-friendly" frontends to it
[02:32] <J4kc1> anurag_: I like to make sure that all the bugs were found before I try the new version, that's why I waited two months.
[02:32] <anurag_> J4kc1, me neither

[02:34] <darksmiley> LjL, ah unrelated question and speaking of KDE - when they get KDE up to scratch (for what ubuntu wants to do with it), do you think they'll get it looking as good as ubuntu and do away with the kubuntu blues?

[02:35] <LjL> darksmiley: i don't think. they're already changing the standard KDE colors/background to something more violet-looking...
[02:35] <eletido> kitche: thought i did.
[02:35] <ivx> hey to renew my dhcp lease i just do sudo dhcpclient right?
[02:35] <jrib> Jeeva: yes
[02:35] <Megaqwerty> jrib: the acceleration of beagle's indexing
[02:35] <Jeeva> jrib: where ?
[02:35] <anurag_> lol @ J4kc1
[02:35] <jrib> Jeeva: anywhere you have write access will do
[02:35] <Megaqwerty> jrib: i.e. the aforementioned "index now"
[02:35] <anurag_> have fun
[02:35] <nicola> when I give "sudo thunar" it says
[02:35] <nicola> Thunar: Failed to connect to the D-BUS session bus: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.
[02:35] <anurag_> gnitez
[02:35] <nicola> (even if it works)
[02:36] <jrib> Megaqwerty: not that I know of.  Only way I know is to start it with that variable set
[02:36] <J4kc1> anurag_: Going?
[02:36] <darksmiley> LjL, ah. it's just that kubuntu doesn't really suit the ubuntu look very well, which is fine as it is parallel, but i'm guessing they will make KDE their primary GUI within a year or so
[02:36] <kitche> nicola: try gksu thunar
[02:36] <nicola> ok
[02:36] <nicola> i'm using fluxbox though
[02:36] <Megaqwerty> jrib: what is kill -9
[02:36] <Megaqwerty> ?
[02:36] <ArrenLex> darksmiley: They will make KDE the default GUI of what?
[02:36] <darksmiley> ubuntu
[02:36] <LjL> darksmiley: i wouldn't be so sure honestly, unless you know something i don't
[02:36] <ArrenLex> darksmiley: How do you figure that?
[02:37] <nicola> kitche,  same error
[02:37] <Megaqwerty> jrib: bash doesn't recognize that command
[02:37] <darksmiley> Mark Shuttleworth is the biggest financial contributor to KDE =)
[02:37] <jrib> Megaqwerty: it murders the process.  It makes it shutdown right away.  killall -9 beagled
[02:37] <Crescendo> My number lock key doesn't work.  Pressing the number keys works, but the period doesn't.  What can I do to fix this?

[02:37] <J4kc1> Why do people prefer KDE over Gnome?
[02:37] <J4kc1> Or vice-versa
[02:37] <darksmiley> j4kcl, because KDE is the future of linux GUIs =)

[02:38] <darksmiley> hehe =)
[02:38] <J4kc1> darksmiley: Kinda heavy though
[02:38] <LjL> darksmiley: not sure that means much. anyway, on Kubuntu by default (well, it works when it wants to), Gnome applications get the Kubuntu colors and fonts (and looks, thanks to the gtk-qt theme engine)
[02:38] <ArrenLex> J4kc1: I prefer KDE because it gives me an amazing number of options to do whatever I want, because it is well-organised and feature-complete, pretty, and comes with anything I could want. :)
[02:38] <borg> xorg keeps saying that i dont have a device section for the second port of my radeon 9800 card when i have already defined it in my xorg.conf, can anybody help?
[02:38] <coz_> J4kc1, it is a matter of preference i prefer gnome because it is more logical and at this point more stable than KDE
[02:38] <jvai> i like gnome for it's simplicity, if i need more the terminal is wonderful
[02:38] <LjL> darksmiley: i suppose they might implement something like that at some stage for the Gnome counterpart
[02:38] <kitche> borg: what is the second port on your card vga?
[02:38] <borg> kitche, it's DVI and the second is a VGA
[02:38] <darksmiley> j4kcl, i think... gnome is a great GUI, but it's a little limited now, and KDE has a lot more flexibility and power, but is still in development really
[02:39] <ArrenLex> coz_: KDE is unstable for you?
[02:39] <darksmiley> it's not as solid as gnome
[02:39] <J4kc1> See? Edgy already started screwing my PC
[02:39] <Fenix-Dark> whats the latest release of ubuntu?

[02:39] <ArrenLex> coz_: Odd. I've never noticed problems.
[02:39] <coz_> ArrenLex, gnome is free anyway
[02:39] <J4kc1> They're both free
[02:39] <coz_> sort of
[02:40] <ArrenLex> coz_: And? So is KDE. o_O
[02:40] <darksmiley> arrenlex, i think he;s right, KDE doesnt quite match gnome in terms of all round stability and stuff. gnome is just rock solid
[02:40] <ArrenLex> coz_: They're both GPL-licensed...
[02:40] <darksmiley> but it will get there =)

[02:40] <ArrenLex> darksmiley: News to me, but I've not run gnome much so I don't know.
[02:40] <J4kc1> KDE will eventually overcome Gnome
[02:40] <jrib> Megaqwerty: ok it should be doing its thing now
[02:40] <J4kc1> Just like Linux will overcome Windows
[02:41] <ArrenLex> J4kc1: And the snow will overcome Hell.
[02:41] <J4kc1> And Ubuntu will overcome all other Distros
[02:41] <Megaqwerty> jrib: top doesn't seem to agree

[02:57] <BackPacker> jrombousk: what defrag tool?
[02:57] <Shaba1> Hello all
[02:57] <Bakefy> I have used utorrent for windows.  is there anything like it for linux?
[02:57] <jrombousk> well its acting sluggish, so i figured its fragmented, i found one on the ubuntu forums
[02:57] <kitche> Bakefy: utorrent can run in wine if you want to use it
[02:57] <BackPacker> Bakefy: azureus, bittorrent, ktorrent
[02:57] <Shaba1> anyone have experiance on getting unbuntu to query a dhcp server?

[02:59] <Trini_Man> lol
[02:59] <Trini_Man> windows with the Crapy file system needs to
[02:59] <Shaba1> I mean I do not want to look a gift horse in the mouth
[02:59] <kitche> Shaba1: dhclient <dev> will make it get an ip from a dhcp server it usually works by default
[03:00] <BackPacker> Trini_Man: maybe someone will write one that does need defragging... :-)
[03:00] <Shaba1> but trying to get these machines to work with my window2000 server is going to be a B*$%h
[03:00] <jrombousk> alright, i guess i have some other problem thats causing the slow transfer off of the laptop
[03:00] <Trini_Man> lol
[03:00] <dustin> question about audio + headset
[03:00] <Trini_Man> shoot
[03:00] <BackPacker> jrombousk: off of the laptop onto what?
[03:00] <kitche> Shaba1: not really just install samba and read samba's website

[03:01] <BackPacker> jrombousk: could be ethernet frame size
[03:01] <crimsun> the -backports repo contains flash 9
[03:01] <Shaba1> I do not want to have to remake the whole archtecture of my network
[03:01] <Trini_Man> yeah Flash hogs the Audio on the system
[03:01] <nothlit> BackPacker, the noncontinguous % will steadily increase, so over time it may be wise to defrag...
[03:01] <Shaba1> Just for these 15 maCHINES.
[03:01] <Trini_Man> u need to close other apps using audio like media players
[03:01] <jrombousk> how would i change that ?
[03:01] <Dev05_> LaserLine, Or, if on GNOME, gnome-system-monitor is easier.
[03:01] <Trini_Man> then restart the browser
[03:01] <kitche> Shaba1: you don't have to I know many windows administrators that run mixed network
[03:02] <Shaba1> If my boss approves it I am just going to buy 15 more winxp licenses
[03:02] <BackPacker> nothlit: how much time?

[03:10] <dustin> Malachi: I had that issue too, i couldnt figure it out, but I found that installing VNC Viewer instead of using Totem works just fine for DIvx stuff
[03:10] <BHSPitMonkey> and that's the end of the road.
[03:10] <BHSPitMonkey> VLC
[03:10] <BHSPitMonkey> not VNC
[03:10] <dope> hmm
[03:10] <nothlit> BackPacker, Ummm... ok.... but no one would use a non journaling file system now anyways
[03:10] <Malachi> dustin: Yeah, I'm using VLC now, and I love it, but I would like Totem integration.
[03:10] <dustin> ahh, my bad, yeah, VLC... i've been stuck on VNC Viewer
[03:10] <J4kc1> dustin: VLC doesn't play WMV's =/
[03:10] <jvai> oi! i found a win 95 cd @ work!!
[03:10] <nothlit> It does
[03:11] <crackcorn> ive set it to never, we'll see here in 5
[03:11] <Malachi> dustin: For democracy and stuff. And it doesn't play .wmvs
[03:11] <effward> I have a quick question: Where is the best place to find screenshots of Ubuntu?
[03:11] <J4kc1> It does?
[03:11] <x-r00t-x> lol # jvai
[03:11] <kitche> effward: OSdir.com in their screenshot gallery
[03:11] <shayan_> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=313961 SOLVE IT AND GET A COOKIE!
[03:11] <jvai> smh
[03:11] <effward> Thank you kitche
[03:11] <dustin> Malachi: ahh ok, i wasnt sure, i havent come across any WMVs, but yeah, i can see how it would mess with democracy
[03:11] <shayan_> kitche, that made my screen black, the restart command
[03:11] <x-r00t-x> lol @ shy
[03:12] <x-r00t-x> lol @ shayan_
[03:12] <shayan_> :P
[03:12] <kitche> shayan_: you mean /etc/init.d/gdm restart?
[03:12] <groklem> jrib: ok
[03:12] <shayan_> kitche, yes
[03:12] <Malachi> dustin: Is it a xine or totem problem?
[03:12] <nothlit> I've played wmvs with vlc
[03:12] <olu> where can i get a nvidia-glx driver that works with kernel 2.6.19?
[03:12] <kitche> shayan_: well it should stop X then restart it
[03:13] <shayan_> how long should it take?
[03:13] <kitche> olu: you can't unless you compile the driver yourself
[03:13] <effward> What is the difference between Kubuntu and Ubuntu?
[03:13] <dustin> Malachi: I honestly dont know, the places i've looked it seems to be a totem problem since VLC works
[03:13] <nothlit> ctrl+alt+backspace restarts x server too
[03:13] <jrib> effward: kubuntu uses kde by default, ubuntu uses gnome by default
[03:13] <olu> bah okay kitche thx=)
[03:13] <kitche> nothlit: well that actually should kill X but in ubuntu it doesn't
[03:13] <effward> Thank you jrib
[03:13] <nothlit> effward, ubuntu uses the gnome desktop environment, and kubuntu uses the kde desktop environment
[03:13] <regeya> whee.
[03:13] <nothlit> kitche, then what does it do
[03:13] <shayan_> kitche, i dont need to restart x, i need to display 1400x1050 and might just reformat to do it lol
[03:13] <wylde> I am unable to network a ubuntu 6.1 and an ubuntu 6.06 so that I can trade files between them. I am able to see the 6.1 machine on the 6.06, but not vice versa. I am able to get both of them to see a windows machine on samba, but I need some sort of a login on windows, and my username and pw don't do it. neither does root and the pw. Help please?
[03:13] <regeya> and xubuntu would use xfce...
[03:14] <regeya> and the 10,000 other *buntus use other stuff.
[03:14] <groklem> jrib: pasted...
[03:14] <jrib> groklem: link?
[03:14] <BackPacker> effward: but you can install Ubuntu and then install the kde desktop and end up with kubuntu
[03:14] <kitche> shayan_: to get that resolution when you edit xorg.conf you gotta restart X
[03:14] <Malachi> dustin: VLC comes with codecs, doesn't it?
[03:14] <groklem> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35691/
[03:14] <nothlit> nah theres only about 6 other ubuntus
[03:14] <Malachi> dustin: But I'll leave you alone and try to find an answer.
[03:14] <kitche> nothlit: it suppose to act like killall but for X but since there is gdm script running it just restarts it
[03:15] <regeya> I'm embarrassed that I'd never heard of auto-apt until this week.  how sad is that...
[03:15] <BackPacker> wylde: have you tried using NFS with the two ubuntu machines?
[03:15] <dustin> Malachi: ok, that would probably be best as I dont think I can be much help
[03:15] <nothlit> Yeah, I thought gdm was supposed to do that
[03:15] <kitche> shayan_: or do the dpkg-reconfigure way
[03:15] <J4kc1> regeya: what's auto-apt?
[03:15] <groklem> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35691/
[03:15] <wylde> backpacker: what is that?
[03:15] <jrib> groklem: what does 'apt-cache policy trac' say?
[03:15] <startswithz> how difficult is it to install ubuntu 6.10 on a amd 64 with an nvidia card?
[03:15] <nothlit> kitche, ctrl+alt+backspace works fine for any xserver started with xinit
[03:15] <valkarin> Is this the place for neophyhtes or should I be else where
[03:15] <regeya> !auto-apt
[03:15] <ubotu> auto-apt: package search by file and on-demand package installation tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.3.20 (edgy), package size 44 kB, installed size 216 kB
[03:15] <J4kc1> Edgy...
[03:16] <nothlit> without the restarting
[03:16] <BackPacker> wylde: Network File System - the standard Unix way of getting machines talking to each other on a LAN
[03:16] <jrib> valkarin: you are in the right place
[03:16] <dustin> crimsum: crimsum, did you check out that paste of my amixer ?
[03:16] <groklem> Unable to locate package trac
[03:16] <jrib> groklem: 'sudo apt-get update' complete ok?
[03:16] <regeya> J4kc1: if you install stuff from source, it'll fetch needed packages automagically.  for example if you ran auto-apt run ./configure it'd grab deps
[03:16] <kitche> nothlit: if you try it on another distro it will kill X until you type startX unless you have gdm/kdm script running
[03:16] <regeya> (if they're available)
[03:16] <J4kc1> regeya: Ohhhh
[03:16] <wylde> backpacker: will apt-get do that?
[03:17] <godlygeek> hi all - i was in this channel about a week ago trying to find a solution to a problem where my laptop backlight would come back on after being turned off by acpi's lid.sh script. FWIW, if anyone else ever asks, turning off the monitor's DPMS in xorg.conf seems to have fixed the problem for me.
[03:17] <fnordfn> howdy! my wifi card works on the ubuntu live cd but not on my kubunut desktop.itll work right after i install for like a day or two but then i get tx packet droped errors,is it possible to take the setting ubuntu uses on the live cd and copy the files to my kubuntu box?
[03:17] <Lam_> do ogg files have id3 tags?
[03:17] <valkarin> cool.  I was wanting to know about compiling the kernel after install.  Is that the way to do it or do I do it prior to install?
[03:17] <groklem> Unable to find expected entry  testing/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?)
[03:17] <Lam_> or is it a different tagging system?
[03:17] <BackPacker> wylde: you'd need to install nfs-network-server and nfs-common - and yes, you can 'apt-get install' them
[03:17] <groklem> jrib: from apt-get update.... guess thats it.... gonna change my sources
[03:17] <J4kc1> I have to go now guys
[03:17] <J4kc1> I love you all

[03:26] <wylde> backpacker: zakk?
[03:26] <jvai> i can get email, but i cant mount the shares
[03:26] <wylde> backpacker: oops
[03:26] <BackPacker> wylde: don't ask me...

[03:26] <wylde> hooked-on-gl: who?
[03:27] <[Relic] > is there any thing that will cause problems if I switch for an amd board to an intel board?  aka will I need to reinstall or will it just detect the hardware changes?

[03:29] <kitche> jvai: well it does if you use openldap
[03:30] <BackPacker> wildcat_19: what do you get if you open a terminal and enter 'ls -l /dev/hda1' (without the quotes)?
[03:30] <bummers> hi
[03:30] <jvai> ooo, i saw that in evolution, but i couldnt get email thru that.. i need a separate package? kitche
[03:30] <wildcat_19> no such file or directory
[03:31] <BackPacker> wildcat_19: then it doesn't exist...
[03:31] <ryanakca> jrib: looking at it, thanks
[03:31] <wylde> backpacker: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/C/network-file-system.html -- what is a hostname declaration as stated on the configuration part of this page?
[03:31] <kitche> jvai: look up openldap but not sure if that's what you want or not
[03:31] <jvai> i get email locally thru pop on evolution, snap, i even got the network printer config'd

[03:31] <wildcat_19> BackPacker: where else would my windows partition be then?
[03:31] <jvai> in the repos? kitche
[03:31] <Hellevator> one question thats kind of been at the back of my mind... why did Ubuntu start with 4.10 anybody know?
[03:31] <BackPacker> wylde: hold on while I read the relevant part of the page
[03:31] <jvai> i'll look it up
[03:31] <wildcat_19> BackPacker: first partition of first hard drive
[03:31] <Hellevator> why not start at 1.0
[03:31] <wildcat_19> BackPacker: is that not how it works?
[03:31] <wylde> because it is better than that
[03:31] <BackPacker> wildcat_19: hold on, I've got two conversations going on at the same time...
[03:32] <wildcat_19> k
[03:32] <astronouth7303> wildcat_19: for me, linux reverses the order of the partitions
[03:32] <astronouth7303> (or windows does, I'm not sure which)
[03:32] <ryanakca> jrib: that seems to be exactly what I'm experiencing
[03:32] <wildcat_19> how can i find out what it is then?
[03:32] <jrib> ryanakca: yes, though it just went away for the initial reporter it seems, without any real solution
[03:32] <kitche> wildcat_19: sudo fdisk -l
[03:33] <jvai> i gotta go ppl, starbucks is gettin ppl out
[03:33] <jvai> ty all
[03:33] <ryanakca> jrib: any idea on how to compile my packages in a pbuilder-like environment now that I don't have pbuilder?
[03:33] <BackPacker> wylde: see the '*' in those lines just above it? *(ro,sync,no_root_squash)
[03:33] <ryanakca> how do you install the ubuntu version of kernel 2.6.19 onto edgy?
[03:33] <BackPacker> wylde: you can substitute the hostname for that *
[03:33] <BackPacker> wylde: i.e. mybox.myhouse.org(ro,sync,no_root_squash)
[03:33] <jrib> ryanakca: I've only used pbuilder for doing that but I suppose you can setup a chroot yourself
[03:34] <BackPacker> wylde: or, e.g. 192.168.0.0/24(ro,sync,no_root_squash)
[03:34] <wylde> backpacker:  what if i'm on the good old MSHOME thing
[03:34] <fnordfn> am i doomed to never have wifi againe?
[03:34] <wylde> backpacker: with dynamic ip
[03:34] <jrib> ryanakca: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot
[03:34] <BackPacker> wylde: NFS doesn't know about that. Forget it. You don't need MSHOME with NFS. Just the hostname(s) or IP(s)
[03:34] <ryanakca> jrib: kk, thanks
[03:35] <BackPacker> wylde: what IP range is DHCP giving you?
[03:35] <wylde> backpacker:  like //ubuntu(ro, blah, whatever)
[03:35] <BackPacker> wylde: No! hostnames don't start with //
[03:36] <wylde> backpacker: i named my machine ubuntu
[03:36] <wylde> backpacker: what to i call it
[03:36] <unclemike> ? can i do i live upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10
[03:36] <BackPacker> wylde: with what domain?
[03:36] <BackPacker> wylde: usually you give a machine a name like ubuntu.wylde.org
[03:36] <wylde> backpacker: mshome (i didn't know what a domain was)
[03:36] <CablD_Ubuntu> im at my friend house how can i tell if he has breezy or edgy installed?
[03:36] <BackPacker> wylde: 'ubuntu' is the host name and 'wylde.org' is the domain
[03:36] <bruenig> !version
[03:36] <ubotu> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[03:37] <CablD_Ubuntu> love bots
[03:37] <BackPacker> wylde:  and ubuntu.wylde.org is the full hostname
[03:37] <BackPacker> wylde: but you can just use IP ranges
[03:37] <wylde> backpacker: i just typed mshome for the host thingie
[03:37] <kelvie> Anyone know a good program to track a TODO list?
[03:37] <ryanakca> how do you install the ubuntu/feisty build of kernel 2.6.19 onto edgy?
[03:37] <startswithz_> how difficult is it to get ubuntu the 64 bit make of ubuntu to work with an nvidia card? I'm dreading putting it on my desktop
[03:37] <bruenig> kelvie, tomboy perhaps
[03:38] <BackPacker> wylde: what IP range do your boxes get from the DHCP server (i.e. from your router, ISP, whatever)?
[03:38] <kitche> startswithz_: as long as you install the nvidia module that is for 64bit your fine
[03:38] <iratik> I know this is absolutely offtopic - but everyone in both #tomcat and #java don't care, has anyone ever installed tomcat on ubuntu? I've gotten it installed an running but am getting a 403 when going to localhost:8180/manager/html, I investigated at /etc/init.d/tomcat5 and saw that tomcat was running as tomcat5, so i've chmod -R 777 * and chown tomcat5 * from /usr/share/tomcat5/server/webapps and its still giving me 403!~????
[03:38] <iratik> When i try localhost:8180/manager/html ?!?
[03:38] <BackPacker> wylde: is it something like 192.168.0.1?
[03:38] <wylde> backpacker: how do i check that?
[03:38] <BackPacker> wylde: are you on one of the boxes now?
[03:38] <wylde> i'm on two
[03:38] <BackPacker> wylde: in a terminal, enter 'ifconfig'
[03:38] <startswithz_> kitche: really? I hear a lot of belly aching about the nvidia drivers
[03:38] <wylde> backpacker: ip? or if?
[03:39] <BackPacker> wylde: if
[03:39] <cafuego> wylde: no windowsisms please ;-)
[03:39] <wylde> lol
[03:39] <BackPacker> wylde: you should see a section with "Link encap:Ethernet" in it and an IP address on the line below
[03:39] <cafuego> wylde: you're configuring the interFace, not the iP address!
[03:39] <wylde> if you insist
[03:39] <wylde> ah
[03:39] <wylde> i see
[03:40] <BackPacker> cafuego: no he isn't. He's trying to set up NFS mounts
[03:40] <kitche> BackPacker: cafuego just told wylde why it's ifconfig and not ipconfig
[03:40] <wylde> backpacker:  i see three ip adresses
[03:40] <BackPacker> kitche: oh, I see. Sorry  :-(
[03:41] <cafuego> yeah, what (s)he said ;-)
[03:41] <BackPacker> wylde: it's the 'inet address'
[03:41] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[03:41] <wylde> backpacker: then what?
[03:41] <BackPacker> wylde: what is it?
[03:41] <wylde> 192.168.1.100
[03:41] <kelvie> bruenig: looks like a good program, thanks :)
[03:42] <BackPacker> wylde: ok, so you can substitute 192.168.1.0/24 for the * in /etc/exports if you like
[03:42] <BackPacker> wylde: or you could just leave it as a * as long as your LAN is firewalled off from the Internet
[03:42] <wylde> backpacker: will the ip ever change?
[03:42] <BackPacker> wylde: what's serving it up?
[03:42] <wylde> backpacker: i dunno, how would i find out
[03:43] <BackPacker> wylde: what's the machine plugged into?
[03:43] <wylde> backpacker: a router
[03:43] <wylde> backpacker: then another one
[03:43] <lemao> Why the boot method: "server" doesnt work in the alternate Edgy Eft install?
[03:43] <BackPacker> wylde: then that's where the IP is coming from... one of those routers
[03:43] <wylde> backpacker: then a cable modem
[03:43] <wylde> backpacker: so it's not gonna change?
[03:43] <BackPacker> wylde: Oh, ok, it could be coming from one of those three, but it's unlikely to change
[03:43] <wylde> ok
[03:43] <wylde> thanks
[03:44] <lemao> I get a "cannot find kernel image: server"
[03:44] <BackPacker> wylde: but why not just get NFS running then worry about the IPs later on. Just leave * in /etc/exports for now
[03:44] <Crescendo> My number lock key doesn't work.  Pressing the number keys works, but the period doesn't.  What can I do to fix this?
[03:44] <peder_> I cant ping ipv6 adresses. Anyone know what possibly can be wrong? Can resolve hostnames that points to ipv6 adresses tho
[03:44] <BrokenPipe> Is there a way to play M4V (iTunes video) files in Linux?
[03:44] <wylde> backpacker: but that will leave my machines open to the net, and you know my IP
[03:45] <Chewy954> does anyone know what dock this is? http://gnome-look.org/content/pre3/32326-3.jpg
[03:45] <BackPacker> wylde: no, I do'nt know your IP from what you've told me. 192.168.100.1 is a local address, not reachable from here
[03:45] <wylde> can you tell it's local b.c of the 192
[03:45] <BackPacker> wylde: but I do know that your cable modem's IP is 70.101.214.135 ...  :-)
[03:45] <BackPacker> wylde: yes, 192.168.x.x IPs are local
[03:46] <wylde> backpacker:  how do you find out the cable modem thing
[03:46] <BackPacker> wylde: magic :-)

[03:48] <pppoe_dude> Chewy954, could be wither engage, kxdocker or gdesklets
[03:48] <wylde> backpacker: it says that there is no file or directory for /ubutu
[03:48] <pppoe_dude> Chewy954, looks mostly like engage
[03:48] <TheDebugger> Guys, is it possible to reinstall ubuntu without deleting my home dir?
[03:48] <bruenig> Chewy954, yeah looks like engage
[03:48] <BackPacker> wylde: what does? And what exactly is /ubutu?
[03:49] <wylde> backpacker: i mean /ubuntu
[03:49] <pppoe_dude> TheDebugger, only if you have a separate /home partition
[03:49] <BackPacker> wylde: oh, is that one of the /etc/exports entries?
[03:49] <TheDebugger> pppoe_dude: Damnit :(
[03:49] <wylde> backpacker: on the web page you gave me, it has that in the lines of code
[03:49] <pppoe_dude> TheDebugger, there is another option
[03:49] <TheDebugger> pppoe_dude: To cry?
[03:49] <TheDebugger> :)
[03:49] <Chewy954> ok
[03:49] <Chewy954> engage
[03:49] <Chewy954> thx
[03:49] <pppoe_dude> TheDebugger, if your / is not full, you can use gparted to resize it then make a home partition
[03:49] <cafuego> Chewy954: probably just the gnome panel in transparent mode with a macos icon set
[03:49] <BackPacker> wylde: that's just an example. You need to specify the directories you have on *your* machine. The directories you want to export to the other machine
[03:50] <TheDebugger> pppoe_dude: Oh! :)
[03:50] <TheDebugger> pppoe_dude: It's possible
[03:50] <wylde> backpacker: wow, I'm lost
[03:50] <BackPacker> wylde: say you want to export your home directory. Then you start the line with /home/wylde (or whatever your home dir is called)

[03:51] <cafuego> Chewy954: find icons, change panel to be tarnsaprent (right click it)
[03:51] <TheDebugger> pppoe_dude: I only have 30% of my drive used, so it could works
[03:51] <pppoe_dude> TheDebugger, ya that sounds like it would work. you will need to boot from LiveCD
[03:52] <wylde> backpacker: it's this one: /home/kevin/music
[03:52] <bcstv> What is a good app for internet radio?
[03:52] <lemao> bruenig: apparently Edgy Eft server kernel was compiled for high mem 64 bit memory (or something like that)
[03:52] <kitche> TheDebugger: the alternate is safer to upgrade from
[03:52] <Pelo> one thing I do miss about xp I realised is those cd icons that show the content of the disk, like the ubuntu dvd I have in showedup with the ubuntu icon in my computer,  I which ubu would do that
[03:52] <BackPacker> wylde: ok, then use this line: /home/kevin/music *(ro,sync,no_root_squash)

[03:52] <pppoe_dude> TheDebugger, you don't need more than 5gb for your /
[03:52] <BackPacker> wylde: you need one line for each directory you want to share
[03:53] <wylde> backpacker: is that import or export?
[03:53] <BackPacker> wylde: you're exporting that directory to the other machine
[03:53] <pppoe_dude> TheDebugger, but i would suggest that you initially create a temp. /home partition, move everything there, then format / and resize it to 5, then expand /home
[03:53] <BackPacker> wylde:  you could just export /home/kevin, then the other box will see *all* of your stuff

[04:17] <kitche> VGambit: sudo update-manager -c will update you
[04:17] <wylde> no
[04:17] <dxdt> ubun, there are ways to get it to work, but I don't know what it is off the top of my head.  I once did it for my logitech mouse.
[04:18] <arrenlex> Pelo: you can always call them with !ops. Why do you ask?
[04:18] <DBO> yes, whats up Pelo?
[04:18] <sdundon> I've been runnin Gentoo about 5 years ow
[04:18] <sdundon> now
[04:18] <BackPacker> wylde: you can do the same thing on both if they've each got one or more directories each wants to share with the other, if you know what I mean...
[04:18] <VGambit> I just did it and it installed some stuff, rebooted
[04:18] <VGambit> I'll try it again
[04:18] <sdundon> I do database applications with the Andromeda framework
[04:18] <BackPacker> wylde: might be less confusing to do one at a time, though
[04:18] <wylde> backpacker:  like /music, /this /that
[04:18] <sdundon> postreSQL/PHP for line of business apps
[04:18] <arrenlex> Pelo: ...? Am I not allowed to ironically correct grammar now?
[04:18] <ubun> bruenig: mousegestures is a firefox extention?
[04:18] <dxdt> ubun, best guess would be to get the type of mouse and start googling and looking in the forum.  It will probably me a small change to the xorg.conf file
[04:18] <VGambit> it says my system is up to date
[04:18] <DBO> Pelo, why?  hes not being that bad
[04:19] <BackPacker> wylde: yes, but you could export /music on one machine and /this and /that on the other
[04:19] <Pelo> arrenlex,  that wasn'T grammar that was spelling
[04:19] <BackPacker> wylde:  or /music and /this on one, and /music and /that on the other
[04:19] <arrenlex> Pelo: Oh. Okay, I can see why I should get kicked for spelling. That's serious.
[04:19] <DBO> arrenlex, stop uhhh... correcting him though, its really not that helpful to the channel
[04:19] <BackPacker> wylde: and so on
[04:19] <Pelo> arrenlex,  besides english isnT' my first language
[04:19] <arrenlex> DBO: Okay.
[04:19] <arrenlex> Pelo: Neither is it mine.
[04:19] <DBO> ok problem solved
[04:19] <wylde> backpacker:  I have to take my sis to her friend's house, i'll be back in ten minutes
[04:19] <sdundon> Wow
[04:19] <Pelo> arrenlex,  edmonton ?
[04:19] <sdundon> big argument over one vowel
[04:19] <BackPacker> wylde: I'll be here
[04:20] <arrenlex> Pelo: Yes.
[04:20] <bruenig> ubun, it won't give you that capability. But if you like using your mouse for doing that, it will allow you to use it to go back and forth. For instance if you use the rocker gestures. If you want to go back, you just right click then left click. Or if you want to go forward to the opposite. Or you can right click and move the the right to go forward and left to go back. It is all customizable, should be a good substitute at least
[04:20] <VGambit> no help past "run update manager?" :(
[04:20] <ubun> thanks, i'll try the xorg.conf thing first if not then that :)
[04:20] <sdundon> peace y'all
[04:22] <bruenig> Are the us repos down again?
[04:23] <bitflip> bruenig: something is going on with them for me too
[04:23] <bruenig> uk I go then
[04:23] <Catshrimp> Hm, never used ReiserFS, but am wondering if anyone has had an problems with it, or if it's pretty stable (as compared to ext3)?
[04:25] <VGambit> I still have no idea how to upgrade from dapper to edgy
[04:25] <Milan> Hello everyone
[04:26] <Milan> I need very important assistance
[04:26] <Madpilot> !upgrade | VGambit
[04:26] <jrib> !upgrade | VGambit
[04:26] <ubotu> VGambit: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:26] <jughead> VGambit, I've read a lot of bad stories about folks trying to upgrade
[04:26] <Madpilot> Milan, it would help if you actually asked a question...
[04:26] <VGambit> how bad?
[04:26] <shishir> Can somebody help me install flash & java for amd64 ubuntu
[04:27] <bitflip> that wasn't too bad - wireless, ati driven laptop functional install in 40 minutes
[04:27] <bruenig> shishir, go to the forums, there are a few posts with scripts that do it all
[04:27] <arrenlex> shishir: There is no Flash 64-bit plugin. You will probably have to use 32-bit firefox in a chroot...
[04:27] <dsnyders> !mp3
[04:27] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:27] <shishir> how do i use 32 bit firefox
[04:27] <VGambit> I don't get it
[04:28] <VGambit> why doesn't the -c suffix cause update manager to tell me about the update?
[04:28] <bitflip> lol - I just went from x86_64 install to x86 - wasn't worth the hassle of a 64 bit setup
=== MannyLNJ08753-sl is now known as badsinger
[04:28] <arrenlex> bitflip: I know where you're coming from.
[04:28] <Milan> :-) Currently, I am trying to make triple boot on macbook pro..... I have already installed Mac OSX and WIndows XP.... also installation for Kubuntu was being ok until GRUB part of installation.... now I can not install lilo and make it work, even to show up in the boot up choice done via rEFIt
=== badsinger is now known as MannyLNJ08753
[04:29] <Milan> so if somebody of you hah a similiar problem and solved it.... then please help
[04:29] <Milan> :-)
[04:29] <Lovloss> my computer cant run dvds anymore. what happend :<
[04:29] <ubun> what's the keyboard command to paste to gnome terminal? Ctrl+insert and Ctrl+V isn't working
[04:29] <Lovloss> they open a second then close
[04:29] <bruenig> Lovloss, try opening with vlc?
[04:29] <nothlit> ctrl+shift+ c/v
[04:30] <ubun> thanks
[04:30] <Lovloss> yes i tried that
[04:30] <bruenig> ubunu, you can highlight text, and then middle click with the mouse wheel to paste it
[04:30] <Lovloss> It just crashes vlc
[04:30] <bruenig> Lovloss, you are sure it is not the dvd
[04:30] <dsnyders> Lovloss, what were you running them with before?  And what did you do between?
[04:30] <Lovloss> uive tried multiple dvds  :<
[04:31] <Lovloss> Ive done a lot between with packages, no idea
[04:31] <Lovloss> I believe it went wrong when i installed xgl
[04:32] <dsnyders> Lovloss, What dvd players do you have installed?
[04:32] <Milan> somebody knows about triple boot and how to do it correctly from the start to the happy end
[04:32] <Lovloss> I have vlc, ogle, totem, and gxine
[04:32] <Lovloss> Not a single one of them work
[04:33] <dsnyders> Lovloss, Do you have room to download/try mplayer?
[04:33] <Lovloss> I installed mplayer yesterday because i was trying to encode a video to flash - didnt work out.
[04:33] <Dragutin00> how do i add available dictionaries to the default ubuntu dictionary
[04:34] <Lovloss> I dunno whats wrong with my compy at this point. I manually apt-get installed a lot of stuff
[04:34] <wylde> backpacker: still there?
[04:35] <BackPacker> wylde: yup
[04:35] <BackPacker> wylde: just to sum up, you've created /etc/exports with lines for the directories you want to export
[04:35] <wylde> backpacker: yes
[04:35] <Dragutin00> nobody ever knows about the dictionary =(
[04:36] <dsnyders> Lovloss, well, I've never had luck with totem.  Have you looked in your log files for error or warning messages?
[04:36] <wylde> backpacker: on both comps
[04:36] <BackPacker> wylde: and you've started the server running in the background on both machines, right?
[04:36] <wylde> backpacker: yes
[04:36] <BackPacker> wylde: and you've created at least one directory on one box on which to mount the directory from the other box, yes?
[04:36] <Lovloss> dsnyders: no... i havent gotten any error messages
[04:37] <swiltig> Hello everyone!
[04:37] <swiltig> Hello, swiltig!
[04:37] <wylde> backpacker: I think so, I've put /mnt/music on both
[04:37] <tonyyarusso> !hi | swiltig
[04:37] <ubotu> swiltig: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:37] <BackPacker> wylde: and do you have /music in /etc/exports on both machines?
[04:37] <dsnyders> Lovloss, I'm stumped.  Perhaps doing an uninstall/reinstall of your playback software?
[04:37] <swiltig> Hello, TiG4!
[04:37] <swiltig> Hello, najand!
[04:38] <XiXaQ> Can clients send audio to a NX server using a microphone?
[04:38] <Lovloss> I guess so... i think ive messed this thing up from farting around without even understanding command line
[04:38] <swiltig> Hello, Zaka!
[04:38] <swiltig> Hello, ryukun!
[04:38] <swiltig> Hello, JensBru!
[04:38] <wylde> backpacker: I have /kevin in both
[04:38] <swiltig> Hello, Isaiah!
[04:38] <Isaiah> Is this anything to worry about "Checking `bindshell'... INFECTED (PORTS:  5190)" reported by the chkrootkit?
[04:38] <arrenlex> Hello, arrenlex!
[04:38] <wylde> lol
[04:38] <najand> hey all...
[04:38] <wylde> and me!
[04:39] <Zaka> hi all!
[04:39] <BackPacker> wylde: it's best to be consistent. If you want to mount something into /mnt/music, then it's likely you'll want to mount /home/kevin/music on it, right?
[04:39] <najand> I have a problem with installing ubuntu on my new computer
[04:39] <sc4ttrbrain> !gfxboot
[04:39] <ubotu> gfxboot: bootlogo creator for gfxboot compliant boot loaders. In component main, is optional. Version 3.2.23-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 72 kB, installed size 364 kB
[04:39] <wylde> backpacker: i suppose...
[04:39] <dsnyders> Lovloss, With the command line comes much power, and much responsibility
[04:39] <Zaka> sry I've a problem ,.. i i've just installed ubuntu but after it loads the screen is black !
[04:39] <Lovloss> so ive discovered
[04:39] <BackPacker> wylde: so you create /mnt/music on one machine, and you have a line in /etc/exports for /mnt/kevin/music on the other machine
[04:40] <Zaka> what could it be ?
[04:40] <BackPacker> wylde: that way you can then mount /mnt/kevin/music onto /mnt/music
[04:40] <BackPacker> wylde: and you do the same kind of thing on the other machine to export to the first one
[04:40] <sc4ttrbrain> !grub-gfxboot
[04:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about grub-gfxboot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:40] <wylde> backpacker: how do i browse the file system as root?
[04:41] <gribelu> hey guys... anyone ever discover a way to disable the Trash completely in GNOME .. or is it wastebasket? :)))
[04:41] <dsnyders> wylde, sudo ls?
[04:41] <BackPacker> wylde: using Gnome? I don't know. I'm a KDE user myself. Basically you start the file manager from the shell with 'sudo' or 'gksudo'
[04:41] <BackPacker> wylde: might be  a menu entry to do just that
[04:42] <Zaka> does anybody knows what kind of problem is if ubuntu remains on black screen after loading?
[04:42] <savvas> linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic linux-headers-2.6.17-10 linux-headers-generic < apt-get autoremove says it's ok to remove, is it true?
[04:42] <wylde> backpacker: is the line is exports supposed to be /mnt.. or /home/...
[04:42] <Zaka> oh no NT Authoriy system !
[04:42] <BackPacker> wylde: /home - /mnt is where you mount exported directories
[04:43] <dsnyders> Zaka, What happens with <ctrl><alt><F1> on that black screen?
[04:43] <BackPacker> wylde: and you're exporting /home/kevin/music - or you could just export /home/kevin and mount it onto /mnt/kevin on the other machine. It's just best to be consistent
[04:43] <wylde> backpacker:  so on the machine that i want to give the music to, it should read /home/kevin/music *(ro,sync,no_root_squash)
[04:44] <BackPacker> wylde: no, that's the line for the machine that the music is already on. That's what you want to export to the other machine
[04:44] <kralcymerej> can anyone tell a complete newb what the easiest way to play *.asx streaming audio is?
[04:44] <gribelu> as i was saying "hey guys... anyone ever discover a way to disable the Trash completely in GNOME "
[04:44] <BackPacker> wylde: that's why I said it's best to just do one machine at a time
[04:44] <wylde> backpacker: hmmm
[04:44] <Wyld> backpacker: ok
[04:45] <Wyld> backpacker:  the machine that is giving the music
[04:45] <Hooked-on-GL> kralcymerej: sorry, not sure :( have you tried wikipedia etc?
[04:45] <Wyld> backpacker: /home/kevin *(ro,sync,no_root_squash) like this?
[04:46] <BackPacker> Wyld: so the machine with the music on it has /home/kevin/music in /etc/exports, and the other one has the /mnt/music directory onto which /home/kevin/music is mounted
[04:46] <wylde> backpacker: and the reciever like how?
[04:46] <ubun> for some reason my ubuntu clock says it's december 7th, it's been saying that all day but it's the 6th here. how can i change it? (i used internet time syncing when i installed it yesterday)
[04:46] <dsnyders> !repository

[04:46] <BackPacker> Wyld: if you're exporting /home/kevin (as per the above line) then you probably want to mount it into /mnt/kevin on the other one, rather than /mnt/music
[04:46] <Wyld> backpacker:  ok
[04:47] <kralcymerej> yeah I have and I've tried a bunch of firefox plugins! all I want to do is listen to a freakin' radio station!!!
[04:47] <kralcymerej> ARGGGG
[04:47] <ClydeGoffe> hey does anyone know how to get sound working for ubuntu 6.10 server
[04:47] <BackPacker> wylde: you don't need to put anything in /etc/exports on the second machine relating to the directories on the first machine. /etc/exports is only a list of the directories you wan to share with the other machine
[04:47] <ubun> i use rhythmbox for radio

[04:48] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[04:48] <ubun> nevermind to my question i figured it out
[04:48] <ClydeGoffe> i have ubuntu server installed on my laptop
[04:48] <wylde> backpacker: the second machine is the one that is getting the music?
[04:48] <ClydeGoffe> sound works if i install ubuntu desktop
[04:48] <ClydeGoffe> only I dont like gnome or kde
[04:49] <alt3r> sry guys.. i need help! i get a black screen when ubuntu is loading !
[04:49] <ClydeGoffe> so installed ubuntu server and apt-get install afterstep
[04:49] <BackPacker> wylde: so, if you have /etc/exports set up on the first machine, and a directory to mount on to on the second machine (the one that's getting the music from the first machine), then we're nearly there
[04:49] <najand> I have a new computer with the following specs: M/B: Intel DP965LT/ Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400/ Mem: 2G/Video Card: ASUS NVida ED7900 GeForce/Sound Card: SoundBlaster XiFi Fatal1ty and I want to install ubuntu, but whenever I start to do so I get the following error: [4294668.174000] PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@90000000 For 000:01:00.0 Do you have any clues?

[04:49] <Hooked-on-GL> alt3r: Where about does it stop?  During the bootsplash?
[04:49] <BackPacker> wylde: ok?
[04:49] <amandalynn> Question Repositorys. does any one know how you can restore the defaults to your repositories?
[04:49] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[04:49] <alt3r> after that
[04:50] <Wyld> backpacker:  ok
[04:50] <Wyld> backpacker:  it is as it should be
[04:50] <Wyld> backpacker:  i think
[04:50] <alt3r> after the screen splash
[04:50] <BackPacker> wylde: now you can try actually mounting the directory. What's the name of the directory you're mounting onto? The one on the 2nd machine?
[04:50] <dsnyders> amandalynn, do you know claire-annette?
[04:51] <amandalynn> no i dont
[04:51] <wylde> backpacker: by mounting, you mean the place that i will access the other machine?

[04:52] <BackPacker> wylde: machine 1 is exporting a directory, say /home/kevin/music, and this directory will be mounted onto /mnt/music on the 2nd machine. In other words, once it's mounted, you'll see the files that are in /home/kevin/music on the first machine appearing in /mnt/music on the 2nd machine. Clear?
[04:52] <alt3r> Hooked-on-GL: do u know what could it be ?
[04:53] <amandalynn> tonyyarusso: thanks
[04:53] <wylde> crystal
[04:53] <wylde> lol
[04:53] <TiG4> How is it that I can't kill a process even if I sudo kill it?
[04:53] <sc4ttrbrain> Ok, i confused, whats the different between gfxboot and grub-gfxboot? And between usplash vs gfxboot ?
[04:53] <wylde> backpacker: whoo hoo
[04:53] <ClydeGoffe> can anyone help with my sound problem
[04:53] <BackPacker> wylde: so, which directory is listed in /etc/exports on the 1st machine
[04:53] <wylde> backpacker: i understand
[04:53] <najand> noone?
[04:53] <najand> Please Help
[04:53] <tonyyarusso> TiG4: Use kill -9 pid
[04:53] <TiG4> thanks
[04:53] <Wyld> backpacker:  /home/kevin/music
[04:54] <Hooked-on-GL> alt3r:  It could be one of many things.  like a failure to load the X server, or some kind of init problem
[04:54] <SilentDis> hi hi
[04:54] <wylde> hi
[04:54] <wylde> hi
[04:54] <Hooked-on-GL> hi
[04:54] <BackPacker> Wyld: And what's the name of the directory you created on the 2nd machine? /mnt/music ?
[04:54] <Pelo> 'lo
[04:54] <alt3r> Hooked-on-GL: i've just installed it is my first installation
[04:54] <wylde> backpacker: yes
[04:54] <Hooked-on-GL> alt3r:  What kind of GFX card do you have?
[04:55] <Wyld> backpacker:  umm
[04:55] <Wyld> wait
[04:55] <Wyld> no
[04:55] <phu> how do I redirect "dmesg" to a file

[04:55] <Hooked-on-GL> k
[04:55] <Wyld> backpacker:  nm it's right
[04:55] <tonyyarusso> phu: 'dmesg > somefile'
[04:55] <VividHazE> Hey can anyone help me, I'm trying to get openChrome installed on a Fujitsu Siemens laptop with a VIA/S3G Unichrome Pro IGP Graphics card, but the forum posts about it arn't working.
[04:55] <SilentDis> just reading the posts about automatix over on Planet Ubuntu...  glad to see I wasn't the only one having problems with it.  had to reinstall dapper when I first started playing with it because of that thing :P
[04:55] <Hooked-on-GL> does a message appear?
[04:55] <alt3r> no
[04:55] <Wyld> backpacker:  the ip #?
[04:55] <alt3r> black
[04:55] <ClydeGoffe> hey all, anyone available to help me with my sound issue?
[04:56] <BackPacker> Wyld: enter 'hostname' in a terminal
[04:56] <BackPacker> Wyld: on the 1st machine
[04:56] <jerp> ClydeGoffe,  do you have a mixer installed?
[04:56] <phu> I want to capture new system message
[04:56] <alt3r> maybe the video card?
[04:56] <ClydeGoffe> alsamixer is installed i believe
[04:56] <phu> i have oops error message
[04:56] <Wyld> backpacker:  ubuntu
[04:56] <Hooked-on-GL> yeah
[04:56] <phu> how do I capture it
[04:56] <wylde> backpacker: and on the 2nd, it is mediaputer
[04:56] <sc4ttrbrain> Ok, i confused, whats the different between gfxboot and grub-gfxboot? And between usplash vs gfxboot ?
[04:56] <valarians> anyone good with swat?
[04:56] <BackPacker> Wyld: try this - on the second machine enter 'ping ubuntu'
[04:56] <ClydeGoffe> just to give u the run down
[04:56] <Hooked-on-GL> I would think it would autoconfigure with vesa
[04:57] <ClydeGoffe> i have ubuntu 6.10 server installed on my laptop
[04:57] <Hooked-on-GL> Can you get to a terminal or console at all?
[04:57] <ClydeGoffe> ubuntu desktop works fine with sound
[04:57] <alt3r> Hooked-on-GL: infact any installation of linux works at all on my pc
[04:57] <wylde> backpacker: unknown host
[04:57] <ClydeGoffe> just can't get any sound with ubuntu server
[04:57] <alt3r> Hooked-on-GL:sure
[04:57] <alt3r> Hooked-on-GL:that works
[04:57] <alt3r> Hooked-on-GL: if i choose it at the beginning
[04:57] <phu> how do i redirect new dmesg to a file?
[04:58] <BackPacker> wylde: ok, on the second machine enter 'cat /etc/hosts' Is there a line in there mentioning the 'ubuntu' host name?
[04:58] <Hooked-on-GL> alt3r: try using sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:58] <Hooked-on-GL> alt3r: and use vesa as a graphics driver
[04:58] <phu> dmesg with oops error message
[04:58] <ClydeGoffe> so this is a fresh install on ubuntu server and the only other major packages that are installed is xorg, afterstep and their dependencies
[04:58] <ClydeGoffe> no gnome, no kde
[04:58] <savvas> removing linux headers does not create problems if not depending on anything right?
[04:58] <wylde> backpacker: no
[04:59] <darkangel_> supongo ke lo ke esta haciendo es revisando cierto?
[04:59] <amandalynn> tonyyarusso: ok i got what i needed from  Sources.list generator but...i dont know what to do with it on the command line..
[04:59] <BackPacker> wylde: never mind, we'll do it by IP. Now, in /etc/hosts on the 1st machine, did you leave the * just before the ( or did you change it to something else?
[04:59] <alt3r> Hooked-on-GL:wow thx a lot! i reboot and i will try ...!
[04:59] <wylde> backpacker: still star
[04:59] <sc4ttrbrain> Ok, i confused, whats the different between gfxboot and grub-gfxboot? And between usplash vs gfxboot ?
[04:59] <Hooked-on-GL> alt3r: no prob
[04:59] <tonyyarusso> amandalynn: So you have the file you need and need help putting it in place?
[05:00] <SilentDis> question:  I'll be dumping my dapper partition, and starting fresh with edgy.  I've backed my home directory of course, and jotted down notes for what i need to reinstall (stuff such as setting up dvd css decoding, etc).  last time I reinstalled dapper (wanted to repartition), I just copied off all the deb packages I had in cache, and dropped them back in, to lower my downloads time.  will this work going from dapper > edgy?
[05:00] <BackPacker> wylde: ok, let's go for it. On the *second* machine, enter this: sudo mount ubuntu:/home/kevin/music /mnt/music
[05:00] <amandalynn> tonyyarusso: i took what it generated for me and put it in text editor and i dont know what to do next
[05:00] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: Copying debs won't work b/c they'll be different versions in Edgy.
[05:01] <jerp> ClydeGoffe try this:  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_configure_sound_to_work_properly_in_GNOME
[05:01] <wylde> backpacker: can't get adress for ubuntu
[05:01] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  darn.  stupid dialup, guess I'll be spending a long time updating again :P
[05:01] <ClydeGoffe> tried that and nothing
[05:01] <wylde> backpacker: mount: can't get address for ubuntu
[05:01] <tonyyarusso> amandalynn: Okay, you need to get that stuff into the file /etc/apt/sources.list, so you need to open that file with root privs.
[05:01] <ClydeGoffe> i'm not running gnome
[05:01] <wylde> backpacker: that is what it said
[05:01] <BackPacker> wylde: I'm not surprised. There's nothing in /etc/hosts for it. Let's try it by IP. What's the IP address of the first machine, ubuntu?
[05:02] <wylde> backpacker: was that with ifconfig
[05:02] <_JECKEL_> hello
[05:02] <BackPacker> wylde: remember you enter 'ifconfig' in a terminal and look for 'inet address'
[05:02] <_JECKEL_> is SSH only to login over the same network?
[05:02] <amandalynn> tonyyarusso: so just delete all the stuff in sources.list and replace it with the stuff i got from source-o-matic?
[05:02] <tonyyarusso> amandalynn: For that, in Gnome you can hit Alt-F2, type 'gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' (without quotes), and that should get the file up for you.  Then, copy what you got in, save, and should be set.  (Then apt-get update)
[05:02] <tonyyarusso> amandalynn: Yep
[05:03] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_: nope, you can attach to any ip, so long as the host machine allows it
[05:03] <Wyld> backpacker:  192.168.1.104
[05:03] <amandalynn> tonyyarusso:thank you so much
[05:03] <BackPacker> Wyld: and that's the 1st machine, yes?
[05:03] <_JECKEL_> ok...well I was having problems connecting to my machine from a machine not on this network
[05:03] <wylde> backpacker: yes
[05:03] <Lovloss> Can someone for real help me choose a format for this video i have? I need to embed it in a website in such a way that *most* people wont have to go out of their way to view it
[05:03] <BackPacker> wylde: So, doing it by IP: On the *second* machine, enter this: sudo mount 192.168.1.104:/home/kevin/music /mnt/music
[05:03] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_: it's possible that the host machine ignores ssh requests from outside it's network
[05:04] <_JECKEL_> how would I fix that?
[05:04] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_: are you admin on the host machine?  do you have control over it?
[05:04] <_JECKEL_> yes
[05:04] <wylde> backpacker: mount: 192.168.1.104:/home/kevin/music failed, reason given by server: No such file or directory
[05:04] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_: any firewalls or such between you and that computer?
[05:05] <_JECKEL_> hmmm..ya know...I never thought of that...the firewall on the other machine might be blocking outgoing ssh?
[05:05] <BackPacker> wylde: but you put /home/kevin/music in /etc/exports on the 1st machine, right?
[05:05] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_:  probably is.  you'll have to allow access thru the firewall for ssh.  could someone in the room remind me what port ssh goes over?  lol
[05:05] <_JECKEL_> 22
[05:06] <wylde> backpacker: does caps matter?
[05:06] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_: you're already a step ahead of me then, i'da had to look that up rofl
[05:06] <BackPacker> wylde: yes it matters a lot. Linux is case-sensitive when it comes to file and directory names
[05:06] <BackPacker> wylde: and commands
[05:06] <wylde> ahha
[05:06] <valarians> anyone good with swat?
[05:07] <_JECKEL_> well once I get this...I guess i'll get cygwin for this windows machine so I can run as a medium to transfer files back and forth
[05:07] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_:  just looking to transfer files, or also looking to run apps?
[05:07] <_JECKEL_> because...I really don't think I can transfer files from windows to linux and vice versa through command line anyway.
[05:07] <XiXaQ> how can I kill all of one users processes?
[05:07] <BackPacker> wylde: you need to refer to /home/kevin/music on both machines. It won't work if you try and mount /home/kevin/Music as it's not the same directory
[05:07] <wylde> backpacker: my music folder is called Music
[05:07] <BackPacker> wylde: 2nd-guessed you :-)
[05:07] <_JECKEL_> run apps as well.
[05:07] <wylde> darn
[05:07] <BackPacker> wylde: like I said, been there, done that, got the t-shire
[05:08] <BackPacker> s/shire/shirt/
[05:08] <wylde> yup yup
[05:08] <arrenlex> XiXaQ: killall -u <user>
[05:08] <_JECKEL_> i found that I could run any terminal window apps..like mplayer..which was fun because I remotely played music >_>
[05:08] <SilentDis> _JECKEL_: yes, then that'll work for you.  I tend to segment things myself.  ftp server for files, X over ssh for control, etc.
[05:08] <XiXaQ> arrenlex, thanks. :)
[05:08] <wylde> backpacker:  can i rename my Music folder to music
[05:08] <_JECKEL_> well i'm kinda just fine with the command line...it'll help me learn it and get back into the grove of it again
[05:08] <Lovloss> nothing will run my dvds. they say they're all encrypted or faulty, or the viewer crashes
[05:08] <BackPacker> wylde: the /mnt/music directory doesn't have to be /mnt/Music, but it's best if it is, for consistency. Or you can rename Music to music
=== DreamThief122 is now known as DreamThief
[05:09] <BackPacker> wylde: best to use the same case on both machines
[05:09] <Pelo> _JECKEL_,  you might like this  http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php
[05:09] <wylde> backpacker: how do i remane
[05:09] <wylde> rmane
[05:09] <wylde> remane
[05:09] <wylde> rename
[05:09] <wylde> grrr
[05:09] <BackPacker> wylde: in a terminal you can use the 'mv' command: mv /home/kevin/Music /home/kevin/music
[05:09] <SilentDis> wylde:  mv source.file destination.file
[05:09] <Pelo> wykle check out the link I gave _JECKEL_
[05:10] <Serial> mc rules
[05:10] <inva|id> is there a command to display the mainboard model?
[05:10] <fnf> I'm starting to learn Python, hence prefer an IDE that has some kinds of IntelliSense (class/function reminder), can anyone recommend one ?.
[05:10] <wylde> backpacker:  what if i already have 20 gigs in it?
[05:10] <BackPacker> wylde: what if you do? It could be 20 Terabytes and you can still mount it
[05:10] <tonyyarusso> wylde: There's also a 'rename' command that takes input as a regex
[05:10] <wylde> ok
[05:10] <fnf> I did find a couple of promising IDEs, but a light-weight, yet funtionally sufficient iis preferable

[05:11] <VividHazE> Can someone please help me with my VIA Unichrome graphics problem :( I can't get VESA to change to VIA and it work properly
[05:11] <wylde> backpacker: and it is now music, not Music
[05:11] <VividHazE> I've tried following all the forum posts none of the suggestions are working for me
[05:11] <BackPacker> wylde: ok, try the mount command again. I'll repeat it here:
[05:11] <carlfk_lap> how do I activate the TV out on an ati mobility radieon x700?
[05:11] <VividHazE> its a VT8237
[05:11] <BackPacker> wylde: On the *second* machine, enter this: sudo mount 192.168.1.104:/home/kevin/music /mnt/music
[05:11] <_Enchained> Can someone help me in packaging for ubuntu (choice of the section for the package) ?
[05:12] <wylde> backpacker: it did not show an error
[05:12] <Pelo> _Enchained,  are you making a package ?
[05:12] <_Enchained> Pelo: yes
[05:12] <BackPacker> wylde: Yay! On the 2nd machine, in a terminal, enter this: ls -l /mnt/music
[05:12] <bimberi> inva|id: "sudo lshw"
[05:13] <inva|id> bimberi: thanks so much!!
[05:13] <VividHazE> Can't anyone help me >_<
[05:13] <wylde> backpacker: there it is, in all it's splendor, reduced to lots of little lines of text
[05:13] <wylde> backpacker: lots and lots of text
[05:13] <_Enchained> lol Pelo (it's not very hard when we have clean sources of the software)
[05:14] <webhed> is anyone decent with shell scripting?
[05:14] <BackPacker> wylde: you might want to fire up a file manager and navigate to /mnt/music just to be sure
[05:14] <Pelo> VividHazE,  if someone can they probably will, but also try looking up your card model in the forum
[05:14] <BackPacker> wylde: but it's looking good so far. And there's one more step to take care of
[05:14] <tonyyarusso> _Enchained: #1) read the Ubuntu Packaging Guide (in system help), #2) Read Debian packaging guide (maint-guide package or something like that), #3) toddle on over to #ubuntu-motu and/or #ubuntu-motu-school for some folks that can help you get started
[05:14] <webhed> I want to write a script that basically says 'if amule is not running, start it, the sleep for an hour and check again'
[05:14] <wylde> backpacker: it's in the file manager
[05:14] <VividHazE> Pelo: I did, none of the 5 or 6 pages I visited any of the solutions worked.
[05:14] <VividHazE> X still crashes
[05:14] <ubun> in irssi running in gnome terminal it seems to be conflicting with changing the channel. ie 'alt+1' doesn't switch channels, it switches 'tabs' in gnome terminal. any idea how to go around this?
[05:14] <webhed> I tried creating a crontab entry for it but its unreliable as hell
[05:15] <BackPacker> wylde: OK, now you don't want to have to keep typing in that long command every time you want to access that directory
[05:15] <SilentDis> webhed:  wouldn't that be better taken care of with a cron job?
[05:15] <wylde> backpacker: true
[05:15] <webhed> I tried that SilentDis
[05:15] <BackPacker> wylde: so we need to make an entery in the file system table (fstab) for it
[05:15] <_Enchained> tonyyarusso: yes (they're sleeping on ubuntu-motu lol)
[05:15] <SilentDis> webhed:  sorry, lag and all :P
[05:15] <Pelo> VividHazE,  have you reconfigured xserver ?
[05:15] <webhed> I tried all sorts of different ways of entering it
[05:15] <quad3d> webhed, ps and grep the name... if it's zero length start the program
[05:15] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[05:15] <tonyyarusso> _Enchained: oh well...another time of day perhaps
[05:15] <quad3d> crontab it every hour on the hour
[05:15] <BackPacker> wylde: the problem is that the 1st machine needs a proper recognised hostname
[05:15] <webhed> quad3d: not sure of the syntax for that
[05:16] <webhed> quad3d: I did crontab it
[05:16] <wylde> and how would i reassign one?
[05:16] <VividHazE> Pelo: You mean from a fresh install? No, it was just installed I haven't done anything with it
[05:16] <webhed> but it doesnt start
[05:16] <BackPacker> wylde: or we need to be sure that the IP address will be the same
[05:16] <Lovloss> Why on *earth* cant i run dvds!? I dont get it
[05:16] <VividHazE> and followed instructions when compiling openChrome, it gets to the end of autoconfig.sh or whatever but says i'm missing packages but I don't know where those packages are
[05:16] <Pelo> VividHazE,   dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:16] <VividHazE> ok will give that a try Pelo
[05:17] <valarians> anyone know -anything- about swat?
[05:17] <_Enchained> tonyyarusso: in fact, my package is for ripping DVDs and I saw "acidrip" in "graphics" section and "dvdrtools" in "otherosfs" section. they are both related to mine so I don't know what is the best section ....
[05:17] <wylde> backpacker: i'm thinking it'll change, but it's just me, because i do some wierd stuff with my network
[05:17] <Pelo> VividHazE,  actualy sudo ...
[05:17] <BackPacker> wylde: what was the IP on the 2nd machine? (ifconfig then look for 'inet address')
[05:17] <SilentDis> !swat
[05:17] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[05:17] <tonyyarusso> _Enchained: no idea.  Ask the mailing list?
[05:17] <valarians> thank you
[05:17] <wylde> backpacker: 192.168.1.100
[05:17] <SilentDis> valarians:  only what ubotu knows, sorry.  :(
[05:17] <Lovloss> Alright, say iive messed up my file system. My data is on a seperate partition, so should i be able to just clean install on that one?
[05:18] <BackPacker> wylde: ok, so one's getting 100 and the other's getting 104. Do you have 2 other machines that hook up to the network at times?
[05:18] <valarians> no prob :) at least its something
[05:18] <wylde> backpacker: yes, 3 others
[05:18] <Lovloss> i dont even know *what* packages i have at this point after all
[05:18] <tonyyarusso> Lovloss: You mean your /home is a separate partition from /?
[05:18] <Lovloss> tonyyarusso: yes
[05:18] <BackPacker> wylde: and are they permanently connected? Or are some of them laptops?
[05:18] <_Enchained> tonyyarusso: ok. I'll ask gloubiboulga tomorrow
[05:18] <wylde> backpacker: one is a laptop
[05:19] <BackPacker> wylde: and do you boot the network while that laptop is *not* attached?
[05:19] <tonyyarusso> Lovloss: Then yes; just select the /home you have during the installer (under manually edit partition table) and make sure it's set to NOT format that one, and install the base system as usual.
[05:19] <wylde> backpacker: once in a while, but not very often
[05:19] <Lovloss> that will remove all my installed programs and let me start from scractch? no?
[05:19] <yoliha> ello, just installed the nvidia-glx drivers and i cant get 1152x864 @ 85hz even tho my horizsync and vertrefresh is the same as before, anyone know how to fix this?
[05:20] <BackPacker> wylde: this could be a small problem. The 100 one is unlikely to change, but the 104 one might get handed 103 from time to time
[05:20] <SilentDis> bit of a hijack here... my /home is on a seperate mount point as well... when I do a clean install of edgy, could I just leave my /home partition unformatted and go with it, no dataloss?
[05:20] <tonyyarusso> Lovloss: Yes, unless you have programs installed on /home.  However, if you have broken user configuration / preferences files they will stay, as they reside on /home.
[05:20] <quad3d> webhed, ps aux |grep xchat |awk -F' ' '{print $11}' |grep xchat (replace xchat with amule) and assign it to a variable. use if -z to test the variable for length... if true start amule
[05:20] <BackPacker> wylde: I'm going to make a suggestion, and I suggest you try it, and if you have problems in future you'll know where to look
[05:20] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[05:20] <Pelo> yoliha,  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf   manualy add the resolution you want to the list
[05:20] <BackPacker> wylde: and you can come back here and get more help, though I might not be here at that precise point
[05:20] <wylde> backpacker: direct me, oh wise Ubuntuist
[05:20] <bitflip> SilentDis: correct, an advantage of doing it that way ;)
[05:21] <BackPacker> wylde: I've been using Ubuntu for all of 4 days or so... (but Linux since 1997 or so)
[05:21] <SilentDis> bitflip:  hmm... i'll be going from dapper to edgy though... should i be worried about prefs or the like 'hanging over' and causing problems?
[05:21] <Lovloss> Well I have choices here. I can do a clean install since im  having all tehse issues and nobody knows what may be wrong... first of all, in many attempts to install g++ and teh packages Anjuta asks for, i have added tons of wierd packages. Second, my dvd players simply fail. :(
[05:21] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: Should, yes.  (I did, but deleted most (not all! Save .mozilla-thunderbird, etc.) of the dot-files, just keeping my actual files)
[05:21] <wylde> backpacker: still...
[05:21] <quad3d> http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html not gonna write your script for you. rtfm
[05:21] <BackPacker> wylde: you need to edit /etc/fstab on the 2nd machine as root
[05:21] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[05:21] <ubun> ubuntu is how people invisioned linux back then for desktops anyway
[05:21] <ubun> the future is now!
[05:21] <tonyyarusso> !rtfm | quad3d
[05:21] <ubotu> quad3d: Words like noob, jfgi, stfu or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
[05:22] <yoliha> Pelo: yeah 1152x864 is already there under Display 24depth (24depth is my DefaultDepth)
[05:22] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  ahhh, okes.  just hose the hidden stuff (well, for the most part, use brains when doing it, of course) and I should be ok.  :)
[05:22] <BackPacker> wylde: and you add a line to the bottom of the file, and it looks like this...
[05:22] <VividHazE> Pelo: I'm working my way through this configuration thing you told me to do i'll let you know if it fixes it:)
[05:22] <Pelo> yoliha,  best I could do , maybe someone else can help
[05:22] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: Yeah, just look at what's there, figure out what it's for, and decide whether to keep it.  As far as having things in that location, yes, that works fine.
[05:22] <BackPacker> wylde: 192.168.1.104:/home/kevin/music /mnt/music nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr
[05:22] <bitflip> SilentDis: I can't forsee any and all scenarios but it worked for me, I even have amd64 and 32bit systems I switch between without problem (with a bit more care than just a /home) but point is yes, you *should* be alright
[05:22] <yoliha> ah okay Pelo  thanks anyway :)
[05:23] <wylde> backpacker: what if there is another line just like that one, but with 103 instead of 104?
[05:23] <SilentDis> bitflip,tonyyarusso:  thank you both.  backups are always good... but said backups are on a ximeta netdrive... so if I can't get that damn thing working under edgy (was a pain in dapper), i'da been up a creek anyway rofl
[05:24] <BackPacker> wylde: there are exactly 3 spaces in what I typed, and what you need to type. There shouldn't be a space before it
[05:24] <BackPacker> wylde: another line with 103 could confuse things
[05:24] <VividHazE> Pelo: Can I ask you a quick question?
[05:24] <BackPacker> wylde: best to copy and paste it rather than type it
[05:25] <Pelo> VividHazE,  do I realy have a choice in the matter ?
[05:25] <VividHazE> If I restart Xserver here and it crashes after that config, how do i get back into the GUI again
[05:25] <wylde> backpacker: i'll do so
[05:25] <VividHazE> haha, well you could choose not to answer
[05:25] <VividHazE> :(
[05:25] <SilentDis> brb, there's a bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream with my name on it in the freezer :)
[05:25] <Arch_the_dell> tada
[05:25] <Arch_the_dell> oops, wrong network
[05:25] <Pelo> VividHazE,  ctrl + alt + backspace I think
[05:26] <VividHazE> oh ok, thanks :) That wasn't my question but anyway
[05:26] <VividHazE> lol
[05:26] <VividHazE> *fingers crossed
[05:26] <bnc-for> shizzal
[05:26] <wylde> backpacker: so...
[05:26] <wylde> backpacker: is that the end to our escapade into ubuntunetworkland
[05:26] <BackPacker> wylde: now, on the 2nd machine enter 'umount /mnt/music' (note that it's 'umount', not 'unmount')
[05:27] <BackPacker> wylde: and then do 'ls -l /mnt/music' to make sure the files are no longer there
[05:28] <wylde> backpacker: "total: 0" would be the right thing?
[05:28] <damageDOn1> Hi, I just installed beryl and emerald xgl on an ati x1600 following the forum guide and I can log in using the xgl session but none of the effects work. Am I missing something?
[05:28] <BackPacker> wylde: yes. Now we test the line you put in /etc/fstab. Enter this (on the 2nd machine): mount /mnt/music
=== [1] CaptainMorgan is now known as CaptainMorgan
[05:28] <BackPacker> wylde: and do 'ls -l /mnt/music' again to make sure they've come back

[05:30] <BackPacker> wylde: You started nfs-kernel-server earlier and it should automatically start on every boot from now on. If the mount command fails to work, that's the first thing to check. Just go to the URL I gave you earlier to see how to start it up again
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> sorry
[05:30] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[05:30] <wylde> thanks
[05:30] <s4br3> nomasteryoda, dann's isp died again
[05:30] <sc4ttrbrain> Ok, i confused, whats the different between gfxboot and grub-gfxboot? And between usplash vs gfxboot ?
[05:30] <damageDOn1> ubotu: Thanks
[05:30] <ubotu> You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[05:31] <wylde> backpacker: my sis just called, she needs to be picked up, so i'll be back in less than 10
[05:31] <wylde> backpacker: thanks so much for your help
[05:31] <BackPacker> wylde: OK, I'll be here
[05:31] <BackPacker> wylde: there's one more thing you need to know. I can wait 10
[05:32] <peerless> can someone help me, I am trying to install Ubuntu using the Live CD and the Install icon on the desktop...it fully installs..and then reboots..but gets Error 17 when trying to load Grub
[05:32] <lllloo> anyone have problems getting FROSTWIRE to run properly
[05:32] <lllloo> i can run it no prob in the root account
[05:32] <nomasteryoda> yes i see... cox it is
[05:32] <lllloo> but in the admin user it stays frozen
[05:32] <Ryugi> hello
[05:32] <nomasteryoda> s4br3, ya
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> maybe its not his ISP, but his router settings s4br3
[05:33] <Ryugi> cdoes anyone in here use ubuntu on their laptop?
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> i have it happen here
[05:33] <SilentDis> peerless:  check this out: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-75417.html - first link from a google search
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> due to some ssh attacks
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> really
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> from Korea and China
[05:33] <lllloo> anyone have an idea
[05:33] <s4br3> nomasteryoda, I doubt it. He said the whole area was screwed just after the show started.
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> ah
[05:34] <regeya> yay ssh attacks
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> then a cable or fiber bundle was cut
[05:34] <mister_roboto> Ryugi: i'm typing this on an Edgy laptop
[05:34] <s4br3> nomasteryoda, they must be trying to "fix" it
[05:34] <SilentDis> peerless:  looks like something went wrong setting up the /boot point.  a reinstall of grub and/or ubuntu might be in order, unfortunatly :(
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> regeya, yea tell me about it
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> yup
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> they do try hard
[05:34] <peerless> silent, i just tried reinstalling ubuntu
[05:34] <peerless> my hard drive is completely empty
[05:35] <Lovloss> Guys, im seriously stressing out here
[05:35] <peerless> how can I check my stuff off of this live cd
[05:35] <regeya> Lovloss, if you're looking for psychotherapy...
[05:35] <Lovloss> for the last two days ive been trying to choose a format for this video to put on my webpage. Everything messes up on other people's computers.....
[05:35] <sc4ttrbrain> Ok, i confused, whats the different between gfxboot and grub-gfxboot? And between usplash vs gfxboot ?
[05:35] <Lovloss> lol reg
[05:35] <regeya> Lovloss, what have you tried so far...
[05:35] <SilentDis> peerless:  you should be able to use system > administration > (some disk tool, depending on ubuntu version)
[05:36] <Lovloss> mpeg4, xvid, avi...
[05:36] <peerless> to try to do what
[05:36] <Lovloss> also mpeg2
[05:36] <SilentDis> lovloss:  a bit of a side-step to be sure...  but would dropping your vids to YouTube solve the issue for you?
[05:36] <talkIRC> ok now i have a really tricky question
[05:37] <Lovloss> I really dont want to do that guys, its supposed to show without controlls. Its for the opening page of my group's website
[05:37] <Lovloss> its supposed to be like, an intro
[05:37] <talkIRC> if i can't find a modem driver for exactly the same kernel which would be better one ver higher or lower?
[05:37] <SilentDis> lovloss:  another aside here:  remember not EVERYONE has broadband... so video as a splash intro is just BAD webdesign in general
[05:38] <Byan> I am getting this error when trying to use nano
[05:38] <Lovloss> i suppose... :<
[05:38] <justin_> I changed monitors and now my RES is at 640x480, how can I get back a good list of res'es in Gnome?
[05:38] <Byan> a] 
[05:38] <Byan> ack
[05:38] <Byan> Error opening terminal: screen.linux.
[05:38] <tonyyarusso> Lovloss: If _I_ ever visited your site and found a video splash, I would send you an angry e-mail.  (It happens frequently.)
[05:38] <Byan> any ideas?
[05:39] <talkIRC> i'm running ver 2.6.15.26 and all i can find is 2.6.15.23 or 2.6.15.27
[05:39] <SilentDis> justin_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:39] <talkIRC> what should i do?
[05:39] <Lovloss> u.u
[05:39] <JoshJ> is there a program available anywhere that allows you to search for all the words in a specific string?
[05:39] <regeya> Lovloss, well, considering that mac users will have quicktime installed, and most windows users will have the windows media crap and only the windows media crap...heh, how about a flash-based intro...no idea how to do that.  but yeah, seriously, video splashes are annoying.
[05:39] <SilentDis> !grep | JoshJ

[05:39] <JoshJ> bleh
[05:39] <regeya> or start an island for wayward kitties.
[05:39] <Lovloss> I dont know flash... oh well.
[05:39] <JoshJ> i mean like in the word "helicopter", the word "cop" exists
[05:39] <JoshJ> or "pilot"
[05:40] <tonyyarusso> !offtopic
[05:40] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[05:40] <talkIRC> not linuxant, using that right now
[05:40] <talkIRC> won't pay for the 56
[05:40] <talkIRC> linux is open
[05:40] <JoshJ> i know there' s a dictionary in ubuntu, so i'd imagine someone's made a program for that arleady
[05:40] <talkIRC> and i want to keep it 100% free
[05:40] <JoshJ> *already
[05:40] <talkIRC> on this system
[05:40] <regeya> tonyyarusso, you know, I was about to mention mencoder...is that on-topic?
[05:40] <talkIRC> so i'm looking at a smartlink modem that i have and trying to find drivers on it
[05:40] <Lovloss> I really wish i knew why dvds dont play. Totem tries to load it up and freezes, VLC just closes, xgine says its faulty or encrypted...
[05:40] <tonyyarusso> talkIRC: You found something else you think will work?  (I have a Conexant modem, so now I'm interested)
[05:40] <JoshJ> !dvdcss
[05:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dvdcss - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:40] <Lovloss> mplayer locks up and wont close... :<

[05:41] <tonyyarusso> regeya: Probably, if they don't involved helicopters ;)
[05:41] <justin_> Could someone please paste what Silent said again -- pkg xorg server reconfigure?? -- 640x480 no buffer :(
[05:41] <talkIRC> i'm using the conexant modem now to talk to you and try to find another driver for another system
[05:41] <byte69> or run automatix and it will script all your windows mulitmedia crap.
[05:41] <talkIRC> oops
[05:41] <SilentDis> lovloss: once it's installed, you have to do a quick command at the term
[05:41] <JoshJ> sudo d-pkg
[05:41] <JoshJ> er, dpkg
[05:41] <tonyyarusso> justin_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:41] <Lovloss> SilentDis: I did the command. it was something .sh
[05:42] <justin_> Thanks tonyyarusso SilentDis etc :)
[05:42] <tonyyarusso> !automatix | Byan
[05:42] <ubotu> Byan: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:42] <talkIRC> driver for another one, i have a smartlink 1800 modem that i can find drivers for, but not for my exact version of the kernel i'm running right now
[05:42] <tonyyarusso> Shoot
[05:42] <regeya> tonyyarusso: it was a lame attempt at a humorous way of talking someone out of the whole 'cross-platform video splash page for my band's website'...guess it was pretty lame to get smacked for a single metalocalypse reference. :->  duly noted.
[05:42] <SilentDis> lovloss:  sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
[05:42] <tonyyarusso> Sorry Byan
[05:42] <Lovloss> I think DVDs stopped working right when i got beryl.
[05:42] <JoshJ> ah, "an" has what i want
[05:42] <cmweb> any one know the name of a disk partioner?
[05:42] <keeganX> Is that why Automatix was taken off the forums?
[05:43] <SilentDis> !gparted | cmweb
[05:43] <ubotu> cmweb: gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php

[05:43] <regeya> automatix == t3h 3v1l3

[05:43] <tonyyarusso> :)
[05:43] <Lovloss> SilentDis: already did that
=== bimberi_ is now known as bimberi
[05:43] <SilentDis> lovloss:  hmm... what error do you get when you try to play a dvd, also what player are you using?
[05:44] <Arch_> can some one help me update my hedgehog?
[05:44] <talkIRC> there doesn't seam to be a crack for the conexatn modem driver i think i'm totaly out of luck
[05:44] <Lovloss> SilentDis : I dont get errors, the players either lock up completely or they just dissapear
[05:44] <Arch_> or point me to a f.a.q. ?
[05:44] <sc4ttrbrain> Sonic the hedgehog ? :)
[05:44] <Vernaldo> just push that thingie and then just click ok
[05:44] <bimberi> !upgrade | Arch_
[05:44] <ubotu> Arch_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:44] <SilentDis> lovloss:  ugh.  what players have you tried?
[05:44] <Lovloss> And im using VLC, Ogle, Mplayer and xGine....
[05:44] <Trini_Man> how do i compile my kernel ?
[05:44] <Pelo> Arch_,   save yourself a lot of trouble,  dl the cd ,  back up your home folder and install from scratch
[05:44] <sunnz2> How do I add a service to the runlevel on cli?
[05:44] <SilentDis> lovloss:  DMA access problem perhaps?
[05:45] <Arch_> thx.
[05:45] <Vernaldo> go to msdewey.com and ask her to compile it
[05:45] <Lovloss> SilentDis: .... um, per...haps?
[05:45] <tonyyarusso> sunnz2: sysv-rc-conf is a good tool for that
[05:45] <sunnz2> Say if I want to add sshd to start automatically when boot up?
[05:45] <Arch_> anything on flashplayer? i got the files, but i don't know the path to my mozilla
[05:45] <Trini_Man> how do i compile my kernel ?
[05:45] <bimberi> !kernel | Trini_Man
[05:45] <ubotu> Trini_Man: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[05:45] <_Enchained> yes Pelo but it needs reinstall and reconfigure all the software...
[05:45] <Lovloss> SilentDis: Whats a DMA
[05:45] <Trini_Man> thanks
[05:45] <sunnz2> tonyyarusso how do I use it?
[05:46] <talkIRC> dynamic
[05:46] <Vernaldo> Disk Media Access
[05:46] <Pelo> _Enchained,   still less trouble
[05:46] <lllloo> anyone have an idea on how to Fix a frostwire problem it works fine in the root account but in the standard account with all priviledges on it just locks up
[05:46] <sunnz2> There is no such command here...
[05:46] <lllloo> any ideas
[05:46] <Vernaldo> Digital Management Assets
[05:46] <lllloo> ?
[05:46] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  a way to access the disk.
[05:46] <wylde> backpacker: i'm here, what was the other thing?
[05:46] <bimberi> !flash | Arch_
[05:46] <ubotu> Arch_: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[05:46] <lllloo> very easy
[05:46] <lllloo> if u have windows
[05:46] <regeya> heh, I had to compile a kernel a while back.  on a ppc machine.  bootdrive was on an add-on card, root volume was lvm, part of that was on a firewire drive.  that was very not fun.
[05:46] <Vernaldo> I love you to the point you can no longer take
[05:46] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  before we go after that... try reinstalling libdvdread3.
[05:46] <tonyyarusso> sunnz2: Use arrow to go to the service and runlevel you want in the table, and spacebar to mark or unmark the checkbox.
[05:46] <lllloo> get a FSF journal viewer
[05:46] <BackPacker> wylde: It's about the IP address problem:
[05:46] <Vernaldo> oops
[05:46] <Pelo> g'night folks
[05:46] <Vernaldo> wrong room
[05:46] <lllloo> and mount the hardrive in windows
[05:46] <BackPacker> wylde: The IP on the 1st machine is now 192.168.1.104, but it could get .103 if the laptop isn't plugged in. It might be best to move the computer down one slot on the (router, whatever) to where you usually plug the laptop. That way the 1st machine should always get the 103 address. You can then change the line in /etc/fstab on the 2nd machine to 192.168.1.103. Ok?
[05:46] <talkIRC> is there such a thing as a crack for something in linux?
[05:46] <sunnz2> No I need to do it in the command line.
[05:46] <regeya> wrong...ROOM?
[05:46] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  sudo apt-get reinstall libdvdread3
[05:46] <Lovloss> SilentDis: Well if it is a problem with that, how come both my cd drives have the same problem and i can still use data sdisks, even data dvds
[05:47] <lllloo>  anyone have an idea on how to Fix a frostwire problem it works fine in the root account but in the standard account with all priviledges on it just locks up
[05:47] <sunnz2> I guess the question is:
[05:47] <_JECKEL_> ok..it's very possible that my host machine is simply not wishing to connect to anything outside of my network for ssh
[05:47] <regeya> talkIRC: the point of Free Software is to have software that's Free as in Freedom and often Free as in Beer, which means that cracks aren't necessary
[05:47] <sunnz2> How do I add a service to the default runlevel in the command line?
[05:47] <sc4ttrbrain> !crack | talkIRC
[05:47] <ubotu> crack: Password guessing program. In component universe, is optional. Version 5.0a-9 (edgy), package size 26 kB, installed size 172 kB
[05:47] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  different way of accessing the disk is used for streaming media than it is for data.  at least, that's my understanding.  do you run into problems ripping audio cds at all?
[05:47] <regeya> oh...cracking passwords.
[05:47] <regeya> duh.
[05:47] <wylde> backpacker: and how might one do that?
[05:47] <talkIRC> true
[05:47] <sunnz2> E.g. if I want to add sshd to the default runlevel, how do I do that?
[05:48] <tonyyarusso> sunnz2: Just mark the box for ssh on runlevel 2
[05:48] <talkIRC> but then tell me why some companies want you to pay for "open source" items?
[05:48] <BackPacker> wylde: what? move the plug or edit the line in /etc/fstab?
[05:48] <Lovloss> SilentDis: now that you mention it, they lock up
[05:48] <sunnz2> THERE IS NO BOX!!!
[05:48] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  :D
[05:48] <talkIRC> drivers and things of that nature?
[05:48] <regeya> talkIRC: are you talking about, say, Red Hat Enterprise?
[05:48] <wylde> backpacker: you mean physically move the cat5 cable?
[05:48] <talkIRC> no not at all
[05:48] <sc4ttrbrain> talkIRC: ask google :)
[05:49] <SilentDis> lovloss:  i'm betting that there's either a problem with DMA, or a problem with the way it's accessing the drive then.
[05:49] <talkIRC> i understand that one
[05:49] <regeya> talkIRC: I'm going to need more frickin' info
[05:49] <bimberi> sunnz2: once an initscript has been set up (in /etc/init.d) use the update-rc.d command
[05:49] <Lovloss> SilentDis: Well i wonder how to fix that
[05:49] <talkIRC> conexant modem drivers
[05:49] <talkIRC> they want you to pay for them to be "full speed"
[05:49] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  i'm doing some searches right now... i won't be in channel for a bit... but I'm lookin', ok?
[05:49] <BackPacker> wylde: yes. Unplug it and move it to another slot. If you can arrange the setup so that each machine gets the same IP every time, things will be much simpler. I always use fixed IP for just that reason
[05:49] <regeya> talkIRC: oh, well, that's because conexant sucks.
[05:49] <wylde> I'm with two machines that share a router, and this router is plugged into another router.
[05:49] <Lovloss> SilentDis: appreciate it :)
[05:49] <talkIRC> other wise your stuck at 14.4 kbps
[05:49] <Vernaldo> umm. so you want to.... hack NVidia drivers?
[05:49] <cwillu> my grub just says 'GRUB', and then hangs.  what should I look at?
[05:50] <BackPacker> wylde: of course, you'll probably need to switch the machines on in the same order each time...
[05:50] <wylde> backpacker: the other router has the laptop and two desktops in it
[05:50] <Vernaldo> talkIRC: just don't use conexant.
[05:50] <tonyyarusso> regeya, talkIRC: It's not Conexant asking for payment, it's indep. driver developers.
[05:50] <talkIRC> that's why i was trying to find out about drivers for different kernel versions
[05:50] <sunnz2> Thanks bimberi!! So update-rc.d foobar defaults would do it?
[05:50] <wylde> backpacker: how can I use fixed IP?
[05:50] <BackPacker> wylde: ok, but best to keep an eye on the IPs of the machine you're exporting from and the one you're exporting to. If you can't mount the music directory one day, it could be because it's IP is different
[05:50] <sc4ttrbrain> cwillu: what u ve done?
[05:50] <bimberi> sunnz2: yep, that's the theory :)
[05:51] <cwillu> sc4ttrbrain: put a drive into a different machine
[05:51] <sunnz2> bimberi and foobar would start automatically each time it boots up?
[05:51] <talkIRC> i have another chipset modem, but need to find out weather or not you should use the one that is one step above my version or one step below
[05:51] <cwillu> sc4ttrbrain: it's worked on 5 or so other machines though
[05:51] <wylde> backpacker: and i'd only have to change the one line on one machine?
[05:51] <bimberi> sunnz2: yes
[05:51] <nick125_> can someone help we get lame working with sound juicer
[05:51] <sunnz2> Very nice!! Thanks so much!!!
[05:52] <SilentDis> Lovloss: found some info for ya... http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/DMA
[05:52] <regeya> tonyyarusso, well, then, linuxant stinks, and conexant stinks even more for their lame proprietary non-modem modem.
[05:52] <bimberi> sunnz2: yw
[05:52] <nemoh> uhm i just lost my winxp entry in the grub menu.lst, is there any way i can get it back? :\
[05:52] <BackPacker> wylde: yes, that should do it, but you don't want to have to keep doing it
[05:52] <tonyyarusso> regeya: agreed
[05:52] <talkIRC> i have no exact match on that chipset
[05:52] <BackPacker> anyway, I suggest you re-read that webpage I gave you the URL of: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/C/network-file-system.html
[05:52] <Lovloss> thank you ^_^
[05:52] <BackPacker> wylde: and maybe something that goes into NFS in a little more depth
[05:52] <regeya> linuxant:  NO POUTINE FOR YOU!!!
[05:52] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  no worries.  that guide looks pretty straightforward, just go slow and step by step.  I hope it helps :)
[05:53] <nick125_> help
[05:53] <wy> anyone using vmware on linux ? I've got a strange problem
[05:53] <SilentDis> !help | nick125_
[05:53] <ubotu> nick125_: I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[05:53] <Jordan_U> nemoh: Yes, try running: sudo update-grub and if that doesn't work then pastebin your gru
[05:53] <sc4ttrbrain> cwillu: try recover your grub
[05:53] <talkIRC> right on reg, that's why i was wanting to know if there was such a thing as a crack for a linux thing
[05:53] <wy> My actual disk usage as display in the guest windows is just 3GB but the virtual files occupies more than 20GB on my linux disk. Now my disk is full!
[05:53] <sunnz2> Would apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla installs flash for firefox?
[05:53] <cwillu> sc4ttrbrain: alt cd rescue gives me a red grub error when I try
[05:53] <_JECKEL_> hmmm
[05:53] <bimberi> sunnz2: yes
[05:53] <wylde> backpacker: so what about that fixed IP thing? no go?
[05:53] <sunnz2> Thanks.
[05:54] <sc4ttrbrain> cwillu: try reinstalling your grub?
[05:54] <regeya> talkIRC: dunno.  I looked for one at one point, I'm ashamed to admit, then went out and bought a different modem.  my board's old enough I have a serial port so I bought a modem blaster.
[05:54] <talkIRC> casue if there was a crack for the modem driver thing i would be more then happy to gety it
[05:54] <sysot1t> has ne1 been able to get an intel 2915 wireless pci to work with WPA Shared key on Ubuntu 6.10?
[05:54] <regeya> lamest.  name.  evar.
[05:54] <BackPacker> wylde: you can go that route if you want. Just give those two machines fixed IPs for now: make them something like 192.168.100.250 and 251
[05:54] <bimberi> sunnz2: and fyi, flash9 (not an official Ubuntu package though) is available...
[05:54] <cwillu> sc4ttrbrain: when I boot of the alt cd, and go to rescue, and choose 'reinstall grub', it fails
[05:54] <bimberi> !flash9 | sunnz2
[05:54] <ubotu> sunnz2: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[05:54] <nemoh> Jordan_U: ye it didnt work =( how can i list my partitions?
[05:54] <nick125_> anyone here get lame to work??
[05:54] <wylde> backpacker: how?
[05:54] <BackPacker> wylde: you just run the Networking application on the System menu
[05:54] <sc4ttrbrain> cwillu: no doit manually, check the help.ubuntu.com
[05:54] <talkIRC> i don't want to go out and buy another modem when i have 4 here already
[05:54] <SilentDis> nick125_: what are you looking to do?
[05:55] <cwillu> !grub
[05:55] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[05:55] <nick125_> i want to encode mp3 for my ipod
[05:55] <BackPacker> wylde: click on the Ethernet connection item
[05:55] <Jordan_U> nemoh: sudo fdisk -l
[05:55] <tonyyarusso> sysot1t: WEP out of the box, WPA with network-manager
[05:55] <bimberi> sunnz2: oops I take the "non-official" bit back.  Looks like things have changed recently (now an official backport)
[05:55] <talkIRC> 2 of the crappy ones, one smart link, and one lucent
[05:55] <sunnz2> Oh.
[05:55] <regeya> !worksforme | nick125_
[05:55] <ubotu> nick125_: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[05:55] <JoshJ> uh, so i'm coredumping when i try to run my anagramming program (wordplay) how do i deal with that?
[05:55] <BackPacker> wylde: click on General to give the box a proper domain name (e.g. ubuntu.kevin.org)
[05:55] <nemoh> Jordan_U: thanks ill try to manually add my xp then =)
[05:55] <regeya> oh wait
[05:55] <regeya> heh
[05:55] <SilentDis> nick125_:  lame -h input.file output.file.mp3
[05:55] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[05:55] <sunnz2> bimberi I just have installed mozilla-flash.. we'll see soon!
[05:55] <Jordan_U> nemoh: But that won't get you the GRUB partition names though, I forget now how to get them
[05:55] <talkIRC> the lucent is in my windows xp box, the two crappy ones in the linux boxes and the other one is just parts
[05:56] <Lovloss> Oh dear, i already have DMA on :(
[05:56] <sysot1t> tonyyarusso: i installed kde nm and nothing still, wont even recognize the intel  2915.. any ideas?
[05:56] <nick125_> i'd like to use sound juicer
[05:56] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  enabled at boot?
[05:56] <Lovloss> SilentDis: yeah :<
[05:56] <Vernaldo> I feel traffic here has slowed down a bit.
[05:56] <talkIRC> is there a list of modems somewhere that work with 6.06 lts?
[05:56] <BackPacker> wylde: click on the Properties button to select Static IP Address and enter the IP address with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
[05:56] <tonyyarusso> sysot1t: I've had to reboot after install nm, and make sure you follow the wiki directions (removing things from interfaces file)
[05:56] <Lovloss> SilentDis: remember, i ran dvds all the time before i installed Beryll.
[05:56] <Vernaldo> Anybody have insights on Ubuntu with Intel 950 video?

[05:56] <regeya> nick125_ http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=957
[05:56] <nick125_> i tried using the pipeline specified in teh help but it didnt work
[05:57] <BackPacker> wylde: and the gateway address is the address of the machine plugged directly into the Internet (i.e. the modem)
[05:57] <talkIRC> thx tony
[05:57] <BackPacker> wylde: if you can't find the IP address of the modem, use the router
[05:57] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  i'm trying to think of what in a beryl install could cause such a thing... have you checked in over at the beryl help channel if they have any input on it?
[05:57] <wylde> backpacker: how did you find my IP?
[05:57] <BackPacker> wylde: I mean use the router's IP address as the gateway address
[05:57] <talkIRC> now all we need is some hard core crackers working on ways to put the hurt on ppl trying to make us pay for open source stuff ;)
[05:57] <_JECKEL_> crap..forgot how to use vim lol
[05:58] <_JECKEL_> what's insert again?
[05:58] <_JECKEL_> :a?
[05:58] <Lovloss> SilentDis : Actually, as many problems as ive had, i may as well clean install my root partition
[05:58] <BackPacker> wylde: Like I said, I right-clicked your nick in my IRC client, then clicked 'Whois'. You can do that in most IRC clients
[05:58] <wylde> backpacker: won't do it for me
[05:58] <BackPacker> wylde: which IRC client are you using?
[05:58] <ubun> what's a graphical SCP client for gnome?
[05:58] <wylde> xchat
[05:58] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  there's NEVER a reason, outside partition editing, major upgrades, or /boot failure to reinstall linux... at least none that i've found :)
[05:58] <cwillu> ubun:  nautilus
[05:59] <ubun> reallY? wow lemme try
[05:59] <BackPacker> wylde: there is a way to do it in xchat. I remember from when I used to use it a few thousand years ago...
[05:59] <cwillu> ubun:  ssh://user@foobar.com/
[05:59] <Jordan_U> nemoh: Can you pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
[05:59] <tonyyarusso> sysot1t: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager was the one I was referring to
[05:59] <Lovloss> SilentDis: Even not knowing what packages youve messed up installing/uninstalling stuff?
[05:59] <talkIRC> thanks for all the help, i'll come back and try to let you all know what i found / did ;) :)
[05:59] <wylde> backpacker: what do you use?
[05:59] <ubun> speaking of nautilus, how can i get it to let me edit files on my windows partition (hda1)? it only has read only
[05:59] <BackPacker> wylde: Konversation. It's a KDE app
[05:59] <cwillu> ubun: look at ntfs-3g
[05:59] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  well... yeah, that can hurt a bit... lol.  so long as you didn't touch the devilsbain that is automatix as well.  rofl
[05:59] <wylde> backpacker: when i right click, it it gives an option for whois, but it no work
[05:59] <Vernaldo> SilentDis: the same is true with Windows. It all comes back to how much you know so you ca fix it.
[05:59] <bimberi> _JECKEL_: i <- insert mode in vim (no ":" needed)
[05:59] <zaan> Hi all. I'm having some major installation problems with 6.10
[06:00] <Jordan_U> SilentDis: I see you have never uised Automatix :)
[06:00] <BackPacker> wylde: oh, no, it wouldn't. I forgot to mention that my machine is stealthed
[06:00] <JoshJ> hrm
[06:00] <zaan> My computer is a laptop and I'm booting into a black screen.
[06:00] <regeya> !automatix
[06:00] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[06:00] <SilentDis> Jordan_U:  ONE TIME, NEVER AGAIN.  rofl
[06:00] <BackPacker> wylde: but that's another story
[06:00] <Lovloss> SilentDis : what i did was apt-get installed stuff, and then installed the recommended stuff too... and uninsstalled stfuf... and then, when i was trying to make anjuta work, it kept asking for this 'Glib' package and i went through hell finding it
[06:00] <zaan> I've read the forums, and they say I should edit xorg.conf
[06:00] <wylde> backpacker: it won't do it for any1
[06:00] <nemoh> Jordan_U: sure gimme a sec
[06:01] <BackPacker> wylde: that's strange. can't be firewalling, then...
[06:01] <zaan> which I did. but after I'm ready with that, I can't seem to get x to start.
[06:01] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  so, you didn't 'try changes' each time you installed/uninstalled I take it.  doh.
[06:01] <wylde> 70.101.214.135- is that mine?
[06:01] <regeya> the configure script for subversion is brutal.  why in the heck does it look for every blessed free fortran compliler known to man
[06:01] <BackPacker> wylde: it's not important, unless you really want to know everyone's IPs
[06:01] <wylde> backpacker: not really
[06:01] <zaan> can anybody help me with that?
[06:01] <BackPacker> wylde: but you could change clients
[06:01] <Lovloss> SilentDis: I didnt know what the changes wre, the packages had obscure names
[06:01] <Jordan_U> zaan: To restart x try: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart
[06:02] <BackPacker> wylde: if it's of any interest to you, mine is 192.168.0.1  :-)
[06:02] <wylde> backpacker: can you WHOIS me and tell me if 70.101.214.135 is right?
[06:02] <zaan> ok jordan, I'll try that.
[06:02] <cwillu> zaan: reboot into recovery mode, and dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and choose vesa as the driver type;  that should get you started (but it's not a complete solution yet)
[06:02] <Thialfihar> Hello.
[06:02] <BackPacker> wylde: is on  70.101.214.135
[06:02] <nick125_> i still got the two apps lame needs to encode mp3 and i still can't get it to work
[06:02] <regeya> I have this repo I created with svn 1.4, and edgy has a far older version
[06:02] <zaan> I'm a newbie... how do I reboot into recovery mode...
[06:02] <wylde> backpacker: ok
[06:02] <BackPacker> wylde: and Wyld is on the same IP, of course
[06:03] <noodles12> I'm trying to compile helloworld in kdevelop. I installed libtools but when i compile, i get
[06:03] <Vernaldo> BackPacker: have you heard or dealt with issues on Ubuntu and Intel 950 vid chips?
[06:03] <zaan> I haven't even been succesful in running the live cd.
[06:03] <cwillu> zaan: escape when you reboot and see 'hit escape to enter grub menu'
[06:03] <noodles12> checking for working makeinfo... missing
[06:03] <wylde> backpacker: wow, really
[06:03] <ubun> vim-gnome is the same thing as gvim right?
[06:03] <BackPacker> Vernaldo: no, sorry, don't know that chip
[06:03] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  i understand totally.  that 'first time install' tends to... well... lets just say starting fresh with some knowledge is never a bad thing ;)
[06:03] <wylde> backpacker: so that is my gateway address?
[06:03] <Lovloss> SilentDis: I have so much to back up... the /home partition should be find if i dont touch it right?
[06:03] <regeya> a switch to any different operating system is always brutal, no matter how esay the different os is
[06:03] <Jordan_U> wylde: The ip of your router / modem
[06:04] <sc4ttrbrain> wyld ifconfig give u all info
[06:04] <SilentDis> lovloss:  did you partition /home to it's own partition?
[06:04] <wylde> oh
[06:04] <wylde> thanks
[06:04] <regeya> I had a heckuva time dealing with, of all things, osx for a while
[06:04] <Thialfihar> I'm trying to port some code of mine to Ubuntu right now and it seems a lock mechanism, which creates a file and deletes it again with remove(), doesn't work here. I -suspect- that remove() fails for some odd reason. Is there anything special about that in Debian/Ubuntu that I overlooked?
[06:04] <BackPacker> wylde: that's the address your modem is getting from your ISP. It's not your gateway address, it's your external address to anyone on the net. Your gateway address is an internal one, 192.168.something.something
[06:04] <bimberi> nick125_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CDRipping
[06:04] <Lovloss> SilentDis: Yes. The root is on ext3, my data is all on ext2 and that partition is /home
[06:04] <BackPacker> wylde: maybe 192.168.1.1
[06:04] <Jordan_U> Thialfihar: Trying to port from another *nix?
[06:04] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  then you already escaped the first mistake I made when getting into *nix.  rofl
[06:04] <zaan> cwillu: how do i do that?
[06:04] <BackPacker> wylde: without knowing your system, I can't tell you how to find out
[06:05] <regeya> to be fair I went through the 'screaming helplessly' phase during 10.0, but it was as frustrating as my first linux experience...ubuntu would be a far better starting point than gentoo, tho :>
[06:05] <nemoh> pastebin is really slow atm =(
[06:05] <BackPacker> wylde: your router manual should tell you
[06:05] <zaan> is it just pressing escape while booting?
[06:05] <Thialfihar> It worked on another Linux distro before, yeah. And win32 before that... this is the first time that piece of code causes trouble.
[06:05] <wylde> backpacker: bcast: 192.168.1.255
[06:05] <Lovloss> SilentDis: I figured it would be a good idea in case something bad occured
[06:05] <cwillu> zaan: is ubuntu installed to some extent?
[06:05] <_JECKEL_> bleh
[06:05] <zaan> no, not at all
[06:05] <wylde> backpacker: is that it?
[06:05] <_JECKEL_> wonder why this won't allow me to write to this file...
[06:05] <zaan> at this point, I'm merely trying to run the install cd
[06:05] <BackPacker> wylde: that's not your gateway, either. It's the address the network uses to broadcast packets to all hosts on the network
[06:05] <cwillu> ahh, then nevermind the escape bit
[06:05] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  so, yes, you'll just be dumping /, and during setup, just make sure to specify /dev/hdxx as your /home (whereever it is), and DON'T FORMAT IT.  lol
[06:05] <cwillu> zaan: ctrl+alt+f1 do anything?
[06:06] <Lovloss> SilentDis: sweet ^_^ ill go do that. thankee
[06:06] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  sorry we couldn't get it 'fixed' for you instead :P
[06:06] <_JECKEL_> ah sudo
[06:06] <zaan> well... after my screen goes black,
[06:06] <_JECKEL_> sooooo
[06:06] <BackPacker> wylde: I hope you've set xchat to log all of this. You might need it in the near future...
[06:06] <Lovloss> SilentDis: Its okay. I know what to do now
[06:06] <Thialfihar> Oh.
[06:06] <zaan> I can get a command prompt by pressing ctrl alt f2
[06:06] <wylde> uhh...
[06:06] <wylde> backpacker: how?
[06:06] <BackPacker> wylde: 2nd-guessed you again... :-)
[06:06] <Thialfihar> I just saw it might be another small thing that has a little side-effect.
[06:06] <Lovloss> bye you guys ^^
[06:06] <zaan> and there I've tried editing xorg
[06:06] <zaan> thing is,
[06:07] <cwillu> zaan: okay, from there, do a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:07] <BackPacker> wylde: I don't use xchat any more. You'd have to ask another usaer
[06:07] <cwillu> zaan: and then choose 'vesa' as the driver instead of whatever else it picks
[06:07] <zaan> cwillu: let me try that.
[06:07] <wylde> backpacker: i got it
[06:07] <cwillu> and just hit enter through the rest of the configure (all the options are chosen)
[06:07] <wylde> backpacker: preferences
[06:07] <hackel_> Anyone had any luck with aMSN webcam support?  I keep getting "undefined symbol: _ng_plugin_init" from the v4l capture drivers...
[06:07] <BackPacker> wylde: that seems like the best place to keep it  :-)
[06:08] <wylde> backpacker: do you have a log that you could send me?
[06:08] <QMario> How do I add sound to my Open Office Impress Presentation?
[06:08] <SilentDis> !openoffice | QMario
[06:08] <ubotu> QMario: a free and open source office suite, including word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, vector drawing and database components.  To install: "sudo apt-get install openoffice.org".
[06:08] <BackPacker> wylde: wait one, I'll check...
[06:08] <wylde> backpacker: thanks
[06:08] <SilentDis> QMario:  oops, i figured for sure it would point you properly... i'll have to edit that lol
[06:09] <wylde> backpacker: how do I find this elusive gateway address, is it on my router's manual?
[06:09] <BackPacker> wylde: yes, I've got a log. I'll put it on the ubuntu pastebin in a minute or two and give you the URL
[06:09] <tonyyarusso> Is there a GUI way to change a password on a remote machine?  gFTP doesn't seem to recognize passwd.
[06:10] <SilentDis> QMario:  there it is:  #users.openoffice.org
[06:10] <_JECKEL_> ok...so I don't get it...
[06:10] <Thialfihar> Ok, it was the other thing and had nothing to do with remove() OR Ubuntu. :/
[06:10] <_JECKEL_> is it ubuntu that's not accepting connections from outside of my network?
[06:10] <nick125_> regeya can u help me
[06:10] <Jordan_U> wylde: try 192.168.0.1 that is fairly standard AFIK
[06:11] <_JECKEL_> or is the ip address i'm getting some sort of spoof?
[06:11] <nick125_> anyone in here using irissi
[06:11] <wylde> jordan_U: as a gateway?
[06:11] <bimberi> tonyyarusso: you need to get a command shell afaik
[06:11] <BackPacker> wylde: each router has an address on the internal network. You can go to that IP in your web browser to change the settings, configure the onboard firewall, and so on. Your router's manual should describe all that and give you the address
[06:11] <wylde> it's really old
[06:11] <zaan> cwillu: problem here... "package 'xserver-org' is not installed and no info is available
[06:11] <tonyyarusso> bimberi: So no way other than good 'ol ssh?
[06:12] <wylde> backpacker: and what was the recommended static ip? you siad?
[06:12] <cwillu> zaan: xserver-xorg
[06:12] <tonyyarusso> nick125_: Yes
[06:12] <Jordan_U> zaan: xserver-xorg
[06:12] <bimberi> tonyyarusso: telnet ;)
[06:12] <tonyyarusso> bimberi: Um, no.  She can learn ssh.
[06:12] <zaan> cwillu: oops!
[06:12] <erin> can someone help me with gstreamer plz
[06:12] <zaan> let me try again.
[06:12] <cwillu> zaan: :p
[06:12] <Byan> how do I install nvidia drivers?
[06:12] <BackPacker> wylde: best to use something the router isn't likely to hand out, say 192.168.100.250. Just don't use 255 as it's the broadcast IP
[06:12] <bimberi> tonyyarusso: glad to read it
[06:13] <Jordan_U> !nvidia | byan
[06:13] <ubotu> byan: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:13] <BackPacker> wylde: anything more than the number of hosts you're likely to plug in would do, say from 20 upwards
[06:13] <cwillu> BackPacker: warning:  dlinks and similar use 100 and above for dhcp
[06:13] <BackPacker> cwillu: he's getting IPs like 100 and 104
[06:13] <BackPacker> cwillu: but thanks for the heads-up
[06:13] <wylde> backpacker: will do
[06:14] <BackPacker> wylde: anything else I can help you with?
[06:14] <wylde> backpacker: and then i have to change the number in the /etc/config file?
[06:14] <_JECKEL_> yeah....maybe i'm not getting the right ip adress outside of my network?
[06:14] <wylde> backpacker: and then i have to change the number in the /etc/hosts?
[06:15] <ubun> is there a faster gui SCP client than nautilus?
[06:15] <nick125_> tonyyarusso will you join a different room to help me so i can go slow
[06:15] <ubun> it's nice but not nearly as fast as winscp
[06:15] <tonyyarusso> nick125_: #ubuntu-classroom
[06:15] <BackPacker> wylde: no, set the static IPs using the Networking tool on the System menu, then edit /etc/exports and/or /etc/fstab as necessary. But yes, you should make an entry in /etc/hosts as well
[06:15] <wylde> backpacker: what is the hosts file again?
[06:15] <_JECKEL_> hmmmm
[06:15] <_JECKEL_> is this all ssh talk?
[06:15] <_JECKEL_> because I could use some help too. >_>
[06:16] <tonyyarusso> _JECKEL_: with?  ( /msg ubotu ssh first if you haven't read that already)
[06:16] <BackPacker> wylde: host names are kept in /etc/hosts for machines with static IPs. You'd need to add a line for each machine that looks like this: 192.168.1.250 ubuntu.kevin.org ubuntu
[06:16] <ubun> need help choosing a nick? :P
[06:17] <_JECKEL_> uhm...with I can't seem to connect to my ubuntu machine from outside of my network
[06:17] <BackPacker> wylde: the first bit is the IP, the second is the full hostname, the last bit is the short hostname, of which you can have more than one. Just make sure there's a space or tab between each part
[06:18] <uniball> cwillu: I was disconnected... what should I do now, back at the command line?
[06:18] <BackPacker> wylde: but if you do set static IPs for the machine that's exporting music, or the one it's being mounted on, you'll need to change /etc/fstab and/or /etc/exports
[06:18] <cwillu> old nick was?
[06:18] <uniball> zaan
[06:18] <uniball> sorry
[06:18] <cwillu> heh :p
[06:18] <Vspirit> weird, I simply can't seem to get the resolution from 1024x768 up to 1280x768, its like gnome and the screen resolution tool is ignoring the changes made to xorg.conf, despite having raised the h and v freqs as the monitor manual agrees with and added "1280x1024" to the display modes, it has not automatically raised the resolution, nor have the resolution tool presented more options than having 1024x768 as the highest just like before. have been sear
[06:18] <Vspirit> ching the forums, but without luck. anyone with a cluestick?
[06:18] <cwillu> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and choose vesa as the driver
[06:18] <uniball> didn't notice that
[06:18] <uniball> that I did
[06:19] <wylde> backpacker: ok, so in my networking box thing on both computers, i have a subnet mask of 225.blah.blah.blah and on one, ip of 192.168.100.250, and the same on the other, only x.x.x.249
[06:19] <uniball> but after pressing enter for all the other options (leaving them at default), i'm back at the command line now
[06:19] <cwillu> uniball: and then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[06:19] <BackPacker> wylde: subnet mask needs to be 255.255.255.0 on both, but the other IPs are good
[06:19] <uniball> cwillu: starting gnome display manager: FAIL
[06:19] <uniball> ?
[06:20] <wylde> so it's ok if the 3rd set is 1 or 100?
[06:20] <cwillu> :/
[06:20] <Catshrimp> Anyone know why on boot my screen stays blank until almost finished with the boot process?
[06:20] <Catshrimp> It only happens when I enable the vga= function in grub
[06:20] <cwillu> uniball: ctrl+alt+f7, and then hit ctrl+alt+backspace, see if that does anything
[06:20] <BackPacker> wylde: you might like to dedicate some time to finding out how to set up NFS on machines that get their IPs from DHCP. Then you can come and teach me :-)
[06:21] <wylde> right...
[06:21] <wylde> backpacker: another question:
[06:21] <BackPacker> wylde: ?
[06:21] <ajcates> can any one tell me how to make nautilus appear in browser mode?
[06:21] <uniball> cwillu: brings up a blue screen that says that it failed to start the x server
[06:21] <cwillu> sc4ttrbrain:  grub is seeing the hd in a different position from linux (!?)
[06:21] <drcode> hi all
[06:21] <uniball> likely not set up correctly
[06:21] <drcode> I have setup linux server has pppd answer
[06:21] <Byan> I still can't get nvidia drivers installed
[06:22] <drcode> server
[06:22] <wylde> backpacker: the machine that has .250 in the end of the ip address should have in the export file the ip with .249?
[06:22] <drcode> I also setup call back
[06:22] <Byan> nullstring@Ayanami:~$ sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[06:22] <Byan> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[06:22] <drcode> how can I use pppd client to call into that linux or pon with callback option?
[06:22] <BackPacker> wylde: which is the machine with .250? The one with the music on?
[06:22] <wylde> yes
[06:23] <uniball> cwillu: it says: "fatal server error: no screens found"
[06:23] <cwillu> uniball: sorry, one sec
[06:23] <sc4ttrbrain> cwillu: last time i had the same condition , i ve to reinstall ubuntu,coz reinstalling grub wont work ,
[06:23] <BackPacker> wylde: then you don't need to make any other changes. The /etc/exports on that machine says that any host on the LAN can mount NFS shares - remember the * in /etc/exports?
[06:24] <BackPacker> wylde: on the .249 one, the one that's mounting the directory, you'd need to edit /etc/fstab
[06:24] <sc4ttrbrain> cwillu: but that was breezy badger
[06:24] <cwillu> sc4ttrbrain: it's reminding me of something I read about the bios being full of lies, but I can't remember the particulars;  grub root is at (hd1,0), but the device is hdc :/
[06:24] <wylde> backpacker: i thought i was supposed to change it
[06:24] <Byan> anyone know?
[06:24] <wylde> backpacker: so i did
[06:24] <Byan> >_<
[06:24] <BackPacker> wylde: supposed to change what?
[06:24] <cwillu> uniball: you know pastebin?
[06:24] <ajcates> Can someone tell me how to enable nautilus browser mode by default??
[06:24] <BackPacker> wylde: the *?
[06:24] <wylde> yes
[06:24] <wylde> backpacker: so the one with the music has a *
[06:25] <BackPacker> wylde: you can if you want, just make sure you put 192.168.100.249 where the * is
[06:25] <cwillu> sc4ttrbrain: I'm an idiot;  grub (hd1,0) with a kernel on hdc1 therefore works :/
[06:25] <BackPacker> wylde: it has to be .249 as that's the machine you're exporting to
[06:25] <wylde> backpacker: that is what i have now
[06:25] <noiesmo> Byan, this is the line to install nvidia-glx it will get modules etc
[06:25] <sc4ttrbrain> cwillu: lol
[06:25] <noiesmo> Byan, sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[06:25] <uniball> cwillu: no... what is that?
[06:25] <BackPacker> wylde: or you could just put 192.168.1.0/24 which will allow other machines on the LAN to share that directory
[06:25] <cwillu> !pastebin
[06:25] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:26] <noiesmo> Byan, once its all installed you need to edit xorg.conf
[06:26] <cwillu> uniball: actually, never mind, I don't think it helps
[06:26] <BackPacker> wylde: then you'd just need that extra line in /etc/fstab on those machines as well
[06:26] <cwillu> uniball:  less /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:26] <Byan> noiesmo: twas already installed
[06:26] <BackPacker> wylde: make sense?
[06:26] <wylde> backpacker: what is the /for in .0/24
[06:26] <Byan> noiesmo: in what way do I edit it
[06:26] <wylde> backpacker: no
[06:27] <noiesmo> Byan, you need to comment out a couple off lines and and nvidia where its nv
[06:27] <Byan> noiesmo: how do I know which lines?
[06:27] <cwillu> uniball: then find Section 'Device'
[06:27] <BackPacker> wylde: the 192.168.1.0 means 'any host on the 192.168.0.x network, and the /24 is telling the system how many bits of the entire 192.168.1.x address NOT to take into account, i.e. the first three bytes (192.168.1) when finding the host machine
[06:27] <uniball> ok
[06:28] <BackPacker> wylde: but now we're getting over-technical
[06:28] <uniball> it says "driver: vesa"
[06:28] <noiesmo> Byan, here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35710/
[06:28] <cwillu> :(
[06:28] <BackPacker> wylde: the 1st 3 bytes are the network address, the 4th byte identifies the host on that network
[06:28] <uniball> which, I've come to believe, is a good thing.
[06:28] <wylde> backpacker: yah. too techie
[06:28] <cwillu> well, it's generally a 'slow but works everywhere' thing
[06:28] <BackPacker> wylde: anything else?
[06:28] <Catshrimp> Or maybe someone could point me to a better place to ask as to why adding the vga= flag to my boot options causes my screen to remain blank throughout most of the boot process?
[06:29] <noiesmo> byan note lines 09 12 20
[06:29] <cwillu> anybody know if its possible to make the live cd use vesa rather than the detected driver?

[06:29] <floating_> Hello. I have a ntfs partition, that I am going to format to ext3 partition. As it is now mounted as /media/hda5 , will it be also mounted to hda5 (but as ext3) after I format it ?
[06:29] <ubotu> opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[06:29] <noiesmo> Byan, I run aiglx and beryl so you dont need lines 28 21 34
[06:30] <BackPacker> wylde: anywhere on the LAN, yes. If you want to ssh into that machine from, say Japan (which is very possible), you'd need to add more magic to /etc/exports, and probably do other magic as well (waving dead chickens comes to mind)
[06:30] <cwillu> floating_: might have to change the type in /etc/fstab to ext3 instead of ntfs

[06:31] <cmweb> how do i go about mounting /dev/hdb2
[06:31] <benkong2> why doesn't opera show up in my add remove programs?
[06:31] <uniball> should I enable or disable kernel framebuffer?
[06:31] <BackPacker> wylde: I stockpile the rabbits for when I run out of chickens. Any other questions? I have other things to attend to soon (pastebinning my log being one of them)
[06:31] <wylde> argh, yeah
[06:32] <wylde> sorry
[06:32] <cwillu> uniball: leave everything else at the defaults, although you can try setting that one to the opposite of what you did last time
[06:32] <peerless_> after installing ubuntu, after I reboot, it starts to boot, and then hangs at the screen with the loading bar filling up... what can cause this?

[06:33] <cwillu> uniball: hmm;  there's a live-expert mode you can boot the live cd in, might be a better approach (setting vesa when it asks there;  there might be something weird that makes this not work how I expect after the livecd has booted otherwise)
[06:33] <Byan> noiesmo: what exactly do you want me to do...
[06:34] <Byan> still failed..
[06:34] <BackPacker> wylde: it's too large to copy and paste. I'll put it somewhere else and give you the URL
[06:34] <Byan> should I just use your config?
[06:34] <wylde> ok
[06:34] <Byan> and take out those lines I don't need?
[06:34] <noiesmo> Byan, one sec I post my full xorg.conf for you

[06:36] <peerless_> after installing ubuntu, after I reboot, it starts to boot, and then hangs at the screen with the loading bar filling up... what can cause this?
[06:37] <cwillu> uniball try the live-expert boot option on the live cd, and pick vesa from there

[06:37] <wylde> thanks
[06:37] <TGPO> peerless_, 'escape' into the bootloader then 'e' to edit
[06:38] <peerless_> when do I press escape
[06:38] <uniball> cwillu: I will
[06:38] <noiesmo> Byan, once you have adjusted the xorg.conf you need to restart X
[06:38] <TGPO> peerless_, after the memory and device detection
[06:38] <BackPacker> wylde: you can set the exports on the 2nd machine to /home/kevin/music, but only if that directory exists on the 2nd machine
[06:38] <peerless_> ok ill try
[06:38] <TGPO> peerless_, WAIT
[06:38] <BackPacker> wylde: /etc/exports on that machine is for defining what *that* machine is exporting
[06:38] <cmweb> is this correct? sudo ln -s /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1
[06:38] <_JECKEL_> well I just found out that my wireless network extends all the way to the front porch across the street
[06:39] <noiesmo> Byan, I dont know if the this sudo nvidia-glx-config enable works but I don't use it
[06:39] <_JECKEL_> I also found out that my friends all have secure networks..which make this late night experiment a crapola
[06:39] <ArwynH> cmweb: yes, but you don't want to do that.
[06:39] <TGPO> peerless_, you want to remove the splash and quite lines from the kernel options
[06:39] <kalm> the /list command  is crazy :D
[06:39] <ArwynH> cmweb: the /dev/hdb1 is a device file, but /media contains mounted directories.
[06:39] <cmweb> ive just dont it. If not then how do i mount it
[06:40] <burepe> I installed drupal with synaptic, but I don't know where it installed to. Anyone know?
[06:40] <dsnyders> Hi all. I cannot read certain directories on one of my drives.  They all are owned as dsnyders:dsnyders, and I am logged in as dsnyders.  They are all drw-rw-rw-
[06:40] <wylde> backpacker: oh
[06:40] <ArwynH> cmweb: is /dev/hdb1 in /etc/fstab
[06:40] <BackPacker> wylde: hold on while I type up what you should have, and I'll pastebin it...
[06:40] <cmweb> no
[06:40] <wylde> thanks
[06:41] <noiesmo> Byan, the other option is pastebin your current xorg.conf and I can adjust it for you
[06:41] <ArwynH> right, do you know what filesystem it contains?
[06:41] <cmweb> ArwynH: was your last post for me?
[06:41] <ArwynH> cmweb: yes, sorry
[06:41] <Byan> noiesmo: seems to be working
[06:42] <cmweb> it has a EXT3 and FAT32
[06:42] <cmweb> its half and half
[06:42] <_JECKEL_> hmmm
[06:42] <Byan> noiesmo: not sure if the fact that it has 6600GT stuff in there is good though.. I have a 7600GT
[06:42] <Byan> but, for now, I am happy
[06:42] <_JECKEL_> ok..well without a doubt I can connect to my comp from my network
[06:42] <noiesmo> Byan, doesnt really matter you could put anything there
[06:42] <Byan> oh
[06:42] <Byan> ok
[06:42] <ArwynH> cmweb: er.. do you know which half is what? eg 1st half ext3, 2nd fat or the other way around?
[06:43] <noiesmo> Byan, well for the discription that is
[06:43] <cmweb> hdb1 is ext3 and hdb2 is Fat3
[06:43] <BackPacker> wylde: I think this is correct: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35714/
[06:43] <cmweb> fat32*
[06:43] <ArwynH> cmweb: and do you want it mounted at every boot?
[06:43] <cmweb> ArwynH: i would like it to bee
[06:43] <wylde> backpacker: do I need to change the ip adresses?
[06:43] <BackPacker> wylde: that configuration lets you share /home/kevin/music on machine 1, and mount it onto /mnt/music on machine 2, with static IPs
[06:44] <BackPacker> wylde: yes, if you're going to use static IPs, you need to set them in the Networking tool on the System menu
[06:44] <ArwynH> cmweb: then we should add it to the fstab.
[06:44] <wylde> and that means i need the gateway thing
[06:44] <cmweb> ArwynH: ok so gksudo gedit /ect/fstab ?
[06:45] <ArwynH> yep
[06:45] <ArwynH> er
[06:45] <ArwynH> cmweb: /etc/fstab
[06:45] <BackPacker> wylde: yes
[06:45] <BackPacker> wylde: so you might want to put off going that route until you find out what it is
[06:45] <ArwynH> cmweb: do you understand the format?
[06:45] <jwise> hello boys, are you feisty now?
[06:45] <wylde> backpacker: ah
[06:46] <cmweb> ArwynH, ij just do as it is above
[06:46] <wylde> backpacker: good idea
[06:46] <BackPacker> wylde: I'd say so :-)
[06:46] <ubun> is there a faster gui SCP client than nautilus? (faster in the sense of when you click on remote folders it moves faster)

[06:52] <cmweb> shi** i just did sudo rm /dev/hdb1 on accident is it going to kill?
[06:52] <wickedly_cool> i just want to know how to get my dual display working
[06:52] <ArwynH> cmweb: as for the 'pass' I think it refers to the priority with which it is mounted. 0 for proc, 1 for the rootfs, 2 for everything else.
=== ryukun is now known as aksuvari
[06:53] <ArwynH> cmweb: er... no, you should be fine.
[06:53] <peerless_> ok I tried booting, and i found out it hangs at "Waiting for root file system ... ..."  what could cause this?
[06:53] <LightShadow> luismipe ask so u can get help
[06:53] <luismipe> i need help for install grub
[06:53] <wickedly_cool> anyone know about dual monitoring?
[06:53] <cmweb> whats the make dir command, MK?
[06:53] <mista> wickedly_cool, i know some i could and try to help
[06:53] <ArwynH> cmweb: it's just removed the link to device.
[06:54] <wickedly_cool> can i message you?
[06:54] <ArwynH> cmweb: mkdir /media/hdb1
[06:54] <mista> sweet
[06:54] <luismipe> how can i install the grub
[06:54] <_JECKEL_> lol
[06:54] <ski-worklap> hmm
[06:54] <_JECKEL_> did ssh connection from the host computer to the host computer
[06:54] <aksuvari> luismipe,  sudo aptitude install grub
[06:54] <cmweb> ArwynH: Thanks its mounted now
[06:54] <luismipe> ok
[06:54] <ski-worklap> my ubuntu machine seems tohang for about 3-5 minutes before becoming usable again after the fscks in the boot sequence... anyone know why this might be the case, what might be going on here
[06:54] <ski-worklap> ?
[06:55] <ArwynH> cmweb: good. should mount automaticly on boot aswel.
[06:55] <luismipe> but i dont have ubuntu now
[06:55] <luismipe> only the partition
[06:55] <peerless_> how can I check my GRUB settings from a live cd
[06:55] <luismipe> i use windows now
[06:55] <wickedly_cool> i use windows at my work so much i have to use ubuntu here
[06:56] <luismipe> yeah
[06:56] <arrenlex> peerless_: "sudo mkdir /target && sudo mount /dev/<root> /target && cat /target/boot/grub/menu.lst" where <root> is the partition on which Ubuntu is installed.
[06:56] <luismipe> but i dont have acces at ubuntu now
[06:57] <luismipe> arrenlex, what can i do?
[06:57] <TGPO> peerless_, had you not bailed out so quick you would have seen the rest of what I was trying to tell you
[06:57] <cmweb> It wouldent be safe to add myself to the root "club" Would it?
[06:57] <LightShadow> luismipe do u have livecd?
[06:57] <peerless_> ah damn
[06:57] <peerless_> what were you trying to tell me
[06:57] <arrenlex> luismipe: ...?
[06:57] <luismipe> no
[06:57] <damageDOn1> Can anyone tell me what the 4th column displays when you use ls -al?
[06:57] <TGPO> peerless_, after you escape into the loader you can edit it by hitting 'e'
[06:58] <peerless_> yeah i did that,
[06:58] <peerless_> but it just left me at a GRUB> prompt
[06:58] <TGPO> peerless_, ok that will give you your whole grub entry to look at
[06:58] <Bakefy> Can anyone help me figure out how to get quadroforic sound... not just stereo?
[06:58] <cmweb> Who knows the member command?
[06:59] <luismipe> i need install grub for in at ubuntu men
[06:59] <peerless_> where can I find commands to use at the GRUB prompt
[06:59] <TGPO> peerless_, if you remove the quite and splash lines from the kernel options you can see all the little odd bits as they flash by
[06:59] <Bakefy> Is there a setting I can just change in the computer that tells the sound card I have four speakers
[06:59] <justin_> What is the sweetspot in VH/sync for 75mhz or even 72hz refresh?
[06:59] <ArwynH> cmweb: root club?
[06:59] <peerless_> ok, then I can see where it hangs
[06:59] <cmweb> Perferably
[06:59] <TGPO> peerless_, that will let you pin in exactly where its hanging
[06:59] <peerless_> yeah
[06:59] <borg> !dual
[06:59] <peerless_> what do I type once im at the GRUB prompt thing
[06:59] <cmweb> ArwynH: perferably
[06:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dual - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:59] <dabaR> damageDOn1: group that owns the file.
[06:59] <borg> !dualhead
[06:59] <ubotu> Information about dual-head on linux can be found on http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/DualHead
[07:00] <ArwynH> cmweb: if you mean to the root  group there is usually no point.
[07:00] <ArwynH> cmweb: what did you want it for?
[07:00] <TGPO> peerless_, to edit it? e then select the line you want and hit enter
[07:00] <peerless_> uh
[07:00] <damageDOn1> dabaR: cheers...
[07:00] <peerless_> after I hit e, it just shows GRUB> and thats it
[07:00] <cmweb> ArwynH: i have no wright access on the hard disk
[07:00] <peerless_> kinda like a c: prompt in windows
[07:00] <peerless_> where I can type stuff
[07:00] <dabaR> !fixres > justin_
[07:00] <luismipe> i need help for install grub but not in ubuntu
[07:00] <ArwynH> cmweb: aah. I rememeber that problem
[07:01] <ismail> hi all
[07:01] <cmweb> ArwynH: then you must also remember the solution, Right?
[07:01] <BluR> can anyone link me to a tutorial on setting up spamassassin
[07:01] <zlack> hey guys - how can i disable my ath0 wireless and keep it disabled each time i reboot? i know i can do ifconfig ath0 down, but somehow it gets up again it seems...
[07:01] <ArwynH> cmweb: in fstab, add user=username,group=groupname to the options section
[07:01] <TGPO> peerless_, once you hit e and then select the line you want to edit you will be at a command promt, worse comes to worse, read the instructions at the bottom of the screen
[07:01] <Bakefy> can anyone help me configure my sound?
[07:01] <cmweb> ArwynH: k
[07:01] <peerless_> na man, once I hit e..nothing shows up but a grub command prompt type thing
[07:01] <peerless_> no text
[07:02] <dabaR> BluR: google can likely do that.
[07:02] <luismipe> i understand
[07:02] <BluR> I can't find a decent one, very surprisingly, dabar
[07:02] <dabaR> zlack: does cat /etc/network/interfaces | grep ath0 show output?
[07:02] <luismipe> i speak spanish and no
[07:02] <TGPO> peerless_, you have to use the arrow keys to select the line you want to edit and then hit enter
[07:02] <cmweb> ArwynH: what would be the group name?
[07:02] <ArwynH> cmweb: then unmount, remount and it should mount them under your username. This is usualy only needed for fat32.
[07:02] <wickedly_cool> does anyone happen to know a good resolution config for dual monitors?
[07:02] <peerless_> i dont see any lines though
[07:02] <ArwynH> cmweb: in a default install it's the same as your username
[07:02] <protocol2> is there a reason why I am not getting any sound...I am plugged in correctly and yeah my sound card is detected...voluyme settings are ok?
[07:03] <peerless_> its just a black screen with the word GRUB > on it
[07:03] <ArwynH> cmweb: or 'users' will be good enough.
[07:03] <protocol2> I think it stopped after trying out democracy TV
[07:03] <dabaR> wickedly_cool: you looked at the wiki?
[07:03] <zlack> dabaR: yes it does, and i commented it all out - but somehow it still adds a gateway for that interface
[07:03] <luismipe> no
[07:03] <protocol2> can anyonje please help?
[07:03] <tritium> !sound > protocol2
[07:03] <luismipe> i dont have grub
[07:03] <grndslm> protocol2:  have you restarted, or is it still acting up?
[07:03] <TGPO> peerless_, hang tight, let me reboot real quick and look at mine
[07:03] <luismipe> and in at windows and not in at ubuntu
[07:03] <protocol2> yeah did that
[07:03] <dabaR> zlack: show me the interfaces file on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:04] <peerless_> ok
[07:04] <luismipe> peerless_, what i do now?
[07:04] <dabaR> protocol2: likely some sound is muted, double click the sound icon in the top right and check
[07:04] <cmweb> ArwynH: whats the command, i cant use unmount /dev/hdb1 since the link got blown away
[07:04] <zlack> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35716/
[07:05] <ArwynH> cmweb: hehe. umount /media/hdb1 will work
[07:05] <protocol2> no
[07:05] <protocol2> I can hear through my mic when I unmute it
[07:05] <dabaR> zlack: you sure you did not add ifconfig ath0 up to any startup script like /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh?
[07:05] <protocol2> but no sound for some reason?
[07:06] <_JECKEL_> hmmm
[07:06] <zlack> dabaR: 100% sure
[07:06] <_JECKEL_> what exactly is the init.d?
[07:06] <TGPO> peerless_, I found your problem
[07:06] <peerless_> yeah?
[07:06] <dabaR> protocol2: run lsof /dev/dsp
[07:06] <TGPO> peerless_, hit 'e' NOT 'c' .. c drops you to command line you want to e to edit
[07:06] <ArwynH> cmweb: i seem to have mixed up my options. it's uid=username,gid=groupname
[07:06] <zlack> dabaR: it seems that every now and then my ath0 if ifconfig up'ed - which is quite frustrating
[07:06] <peerless_> heh, Im almost positve I hit e
[07:07] <peerless_> but ill try again
[07:07] <peerless_> brb
[07:07] <protocol2> dabaR, in console?
[07:07] <cmweb> ArwynH http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35718/
[07:08] <dabaR> protocol2: in a terminal of some sort, ya
[07:08] <protocol2> then what?
[07:08] <dabaR> protocol2: does it give any output?
[07:08] <luismipe> dabaR, i need help
[07:08] <protocol2> no
[07:08] <dabaR> luismipe: ya, you want to install grub, but you are not in ubuntu?
[07:08] <luismipe> yeah
[07:08] <protocol2> I typed lsof /dev/dsp
[07:08] <dabaR> protocol2: show me output of amixer on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:09] <dsnyders> Hi all. I cannot read certain directories on one of my drives.  They all are owned as dsnyders:dsnyders, and I am logged in as dsnyders.  They are all drw-rw-rw-  What's wrong?
[07:09] <zlack> dabaR: is there a daemon which checks and ups the interfaces if they are down?
[07:09] <luismipe> what i do?
[07:09] <protocol2> dabaR, how do I do that...get the output?
[07:09] <noiesmo> dsnyders, no execute
[07:09] <cmweb> ArwynH, unmount does not work
[07:09] <dabaR> luismipe: it is impossible to install it from windows. You will need a live CD. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows shows more info.
[07:09] <dabaR> protocol2: run it in a terminal
[07:09] <ArwynH> cmweb: there is a way to return a broken device node, but unfortunately I can't remember it. Rebooting should return it for you.
[07:10] <ArwynH> cmweb: wait.
[07:10] <luismipe> dabaR, ok
[07:10] <dabaR> zlack: ya, networking, but I thought it only looks in the interfaces file.
[07:10] <dsnyders> noiesmo, Everything was fine in dapper, why is execute necessary in edgy?
[07:10] <noiesmo> dsnyders,  should be drwxr-x-r-x
[07:10] <luismipe> thanks
[07:10] <ArwynH> cmweb: 1 sec. I've remembered something.
[07:10] <dabaR> luismipe: good luck, you are welcome.
[07:10] <cmweb> k
[07:10] <zlack> dabaR: :(
[07:10] <noiesmo> dsnyders, not sure I just know all mine are
[07:11] <dabaR> protocol2: run amixer in a terminal, then copy and paste the text it spits out onto the pastebin site.
[07:11] <protocol2> dabaR, done
[07:12] <protocol2> dabaR, take a look at it...thx
[07:12] <cmweb> ArwynH, ok so after iv's reboot i do "sudo unmount /media/hdb1" then "sudo mount /dev/hda1" ?
[07:12] <dabaR> protocol2: show me the URL, please.
[07:12] <ArwynH> cmweb: after a reboot it should have mounted it.
[07:12] <protocol2> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35719/
[07:13] <cmweb> well only one way to find out
[07:13] <ArwynH> cmweb: on some systems /dev/hd* are just links as well, but not on ubuntu it seems. rebooting should fix the /dev problem though.
[07:15] <RodimusPrime> does azureus work ?
[07:15] <Bakefy> anyone here using google earth?
[07:15] <FANTASMA> hi
[07:15] <RodimusPrime> on amd64 ?
[07:15] <ArwynH> Bakefy: not atm, but i have used it.
[07:15] <FANTASMA> help..... there is an italian help channel ?
[07:15] <Bakefy> my video card displays it very slowly
[07:15] <dabaR> protocol2: looks fine. GO through the process ubotu sent you a message about.
[07:16] <dabaR> !it > FANTASMA
[07:16] <ArwynH> Bakefy: what is your video card?
[07:16] <Bakefy> ArwynH, do you have any ideas... it says that if I get out of opengl mode it will run faster
[07:16] <Bakefy> its crappy
[07:16] <mista> wht does this mean? The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[07:16] <mista>   xserver-xgl: Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4-1) but 2.3.6-0ubuntu20 is to be installed
[07:16] <mista> E: Broken packages
[07:16] <peerless_> TGPO, okay it scrolled for a while and then said Done.  and then Begin: Waiting for root file system... ...
[07:16] <Bakefy> nvidia geforce 400
[07:16] <Bakefy> 32 MB
[07:16] <peerless_> and just sat there
[07:17] <FANTASMA> thx
[07:17] <FANTASMA> <<<<<
[07:17] <dabaR> mista: it means you have an older version of some package installed than you need. Show your sources.list on a pastebin, please.
[07:17] <ismail> guys how do u enter the bluetooth setup in ubuntu?
[07:17] <Bakefy> ArwynH, my card may be old, but google earth works on windows just fine
[07:17] <mista> so how can i update it!
[07:17] <ArwynH> Bakefy: hmm a it dated, but I'm not sure of the specs of google earth. What drivers are you running?
[07:18] <Lovloss> How come when i try to install ubuntu it says "no file system was specified for SDA1" when SDA1 is marked EXT3?
[07:18] <ArwynH> Bakefy: the defaults?
[07:18] <x-r00t-x> ismail,  apt-get install gnome-bluetooth
[07:18] <dabaR> show your /etc/apt/sources.list in a pastebin
[07:18] <Bakefy> ArwynH, yes... i havent changed anything
[07:18] <ArwynH> Bakefy: then changing drivers will probably help.
[07:18] <mista> um how?
[07:18] <Bakefy> does nvida offer drivers?
[07:18] <ArwynH> Bakefy: i havn't done this myself, but there is a howto. one minute and i'll look up the link.
[07:19] <dabaR> mista: run cat /etc/apt/sources.list in a terminal, and paste the output to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:19] <damageDOn1> Help with permissions please! I've managed to use chown and chgrp on a tar file that I've copied across from an old computer using scp but when I click on the properties of the file it still says root is the owner. Any ideas?
[07:19] <ArwynH> Bakefy: yes. but it's easier to get them through ubuntu, i'll look up the link.
[07:19] <protocol2> dabaR, how do I unmute sounds in alsamixer via console?
[07:19] <dabaR> damageDOn1: sudo chown user:user file is the syntax
[07:19] <ismail> x-r00t-x: then what
[07:19] <dabaR> protocol2: m is the button
[07:19] <protocol2> ok
[07:20] <Lovloss> And why wont this live cd see my internal HD? it only sees my external except in patritioning mode. The internal is ext3 format !
[07:20] <dabaR> protocol2: the little m on the bottom becomes a 0.
[07:20] <damageDOn1> dabaR: That's what I used... well except for the :user bit
[07:20] <mista> sweet http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35727/
[07:20] <Lovloss> I mean the internal is in ext3 format. thats whats odd
[07:20] <dabaR> damageDOn1: and ls -l still shows root as the owner?
[07:20] <ArwynH> Bakefy: what ubuntu version are you running?
[07:20] <ismail> i dont see a menue for editing bluetooth services
[07:20] <mista> found it
[07:21] <Bakefy> the newest
[07:21] <damageDOn1> dabaR: no it shows me as the user and group is correct too.
[07:21] <dabaR> mista: your beryl package is made for edgy, and your system is dapper.
[07:21] <mista> i have something in there for edge and im using drapper
[07:21] <dabaR> mista: right. For help with beryl/xgl, there is often someone on #ubuntu-xgl
[07:21] <dabaR> damageDOn1: then it is fine, maybe nautilus is slow or something, you running ubuntu gnome?
[07:22] <Lovloss> Im on a live cd. I should be able to get into an ext3 internal drive shouldnt i? i dont get it
[07:22] <justin_> Can anyone tell me how I can get a 75hz refresh.... -- It tells me 60HZ or 87hz -- but 87 just kills the monitor
[07:22] <dabaR> !bluetooth | ismail
[07:22] <ubotu> ismail: For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[07:22] <damageDOn1> dabaR: yep... should I log out and back in again? or is there a way to restart the desktop?
[07:22] <dabaR> Lovloss: sudo fdisk -l
[07:22] <samiam> how can I add the "burn" option to the right-click menu in nautilus under edgy?
[07:22] <Bakefy> ArwynH: 6.10 Edgy
[07:22] <protocol2> dabaR, why is it I can hear myself over the mic...but cant hear sounds....weird?
[07:22] <dabaR> damageDOn1: killall nautilus should do it.
[07:22] <ArwynH> Bakefy: 6.10? then the following link should help: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29
[07:22] <wavefunction> !window manager
[07:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about window manager - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:23] <Lovloss> dabaR - they're listed :D But how do i access them?
[07:23] <Bakefy> ArwynH: do you know how I can get all of my speakers to work too>
[07:23] <dabaR> protocol2: did you check that your apps are using the same mixer that gnome has set up?
[07:23] <dabaR> protocol2: the message ubotu sent you shows how.
[07:23] <wavefunction> In what file do I have the default window manager defined ?
[07:23] <damageDOn1> dabaR: thanks buddy!
[07:23] <peerless_> anyone know what could cause this during booting: said Done.  and then Begin: Waiting for root file system... ...
[07:23] <dabaR> Lovloss: run mount by itself, to see whether they are mounted. if not, mount them...
[07:23] <Lovloss> I tried. mount /dev/hda fails
[07:24] <BHSPitLappy> hey
[07:24] <dabaR> samiam: for .iso files?
[07:24] <Lovloss> dabaR: it says it cant find them in fstab
[07:24] <ArwynH> Bakefy: by all I'm assuming you have more than 2. I've heard it is possible, but I've never tried or heard how to do it. Sorry.
[07:24] <dabaR> Lovloss: that is not how you mount a partition, that would be mounting a drive.
[07:24] <BHSPitLappy> how hard is it to get the slideshow screensaver (or the OpenGL slideshow one) to use /home/xxx/Pictures, for instance?
[07:24] <Lovloss> dabaR: what should i type?
[07:24] <dabaR> Lovloss: plus if they are not in fstab, you have to specify a mount point, a dir to which to mount it.
[07:24] <Lovloss> ohhh right!
[07:24] <dabaR> Lovloss: this depends on the partition name and the mount point you want.
[07:24] <Bakefy> okay, well thanks! I will look it up.  in the mean time!!!  the graphics!
[07:25] <samiam> dabaR: yes for iso's
[07:25] <justin_> Can anyone tell me how I can get a 75hz refresh.... -- It tells me 60HZ or 87hz -- but 87 just kills the monitor
[07:25] <dabaR> wavefunction: .dmrc
[07:25] <samiam> it used to be there, but just realized it has disappeared
[07:25] <dabaR> samiam: for .iso files?
[07:25] <astroboy> ?join #slug
[07:25] <samiam> dabaR: yes for .iso files
[07:26] <dabaR> justin_: what I do is I enter the refresh rates into the conf file manually, and the fixres page ubotu told you about explains that, did you read?
[07:26] <Bakefy> anyone have a bit torrent app they like to use?  bittorrent seems slow to me and it only lets me download one at a time
[07:27] <ismail> is there no gui for bt setup like in kde?
[07:27] <dabaR> Bakefy: gnome-btdownload is what comes default with ubuntu
[07:27] <Bakefy> dabaR: does it let you download more than one?
[07:28] <dabaR> Bakefy: yes.
[07:28] <Bakefy> thanks!
[07:28] <Byan> my sound doesn't work, I suspect it's using the wrong device, seeing as my motherboard as an integrated one
[07:28] <Byan> what do I do?
[07:29] <wavefunction> dabaR: Thanks ! But is there a global way to do this. I mean for every user, a system wide configuration ?
[07:29] <dabaR> samiam: do you see an i on the first column of the nautilus-cd-burner line when you run aptitude search nautilus?
[07:29] <Bakefy> dabaR, wait thats what I have been using
[07:29] <dabaR> wavefunction: I do not know.
[07:29] <Bakefy> it doenst let me downlaod more than one torrent at a time
[07:29] <dabaR> Bakefy: you are then downloading from a site that does not allow it.
[07:29] <Bakefy> it says address already in use
[07:29] <protocol2> dabaR, I am going to get the alsa drivers from a fresh kernel... :)
[07:29] <protocol2> thx for the help though
[07:29] <wavefunction> dabaR: Anyway, thanks for the help ! :)
[07:29] <dabaR> I had that with <insertHere> sites...
=== corsair is now known as Gargoyle
[07:30] <samiam> dabaR: yes I do see an "i", I just realize that the file I wanted to burn wasn't a .iso sorry about
=== Gargoyle is now known as Darksair
[07:30] <sivik> i'm having some issues trying to set up my tvtuner card to work, its hauppauge pvr150
[07:30] <samiam> I guess it only shows if its an iso file
[07:31] <dabaR> samiam: go>cd/dvd creator
[07:31] <Bakefy> dabaR, there has to be a torrent app that looks like utorrent (for windows)
[07:31] <floating_> Hi. What options should I set to a new ext3 partitionI made ? mount point to where ? what about the other options
[07:31] <samiam> dabaR: yep, thanks... I missed this one thanks for the help
[07:32] <ArwynH> Byan: system -> admin -> sounds
[07:32] <ArwynH> Byan: er system -> prefs -> sounds. sorry
[07:32] <necrodrako> i need help with playing a dvd
[07:33] <omoore> ok.. here is an oddity.. i'm running ubuntu.. i mount a usb external drive.. access is is fine.. issuing a du --max-depht=1 -h . returns valid information...
[07:33] <omoore> but.. issuing df -h  shows only 6.9G used when in reality.. more like 47GB is used
[07:33] <dabaR> floating_: usual mount point is /media/hdXY same as the device node hdXY. defaults is a good set of options. "defaults". what do you want to be able to do the partition when you mount it?
[07:34] <necrodrako> can any one help me with playing a dvd
[07:34] <Lovloss> Does anyone think they can walk me through an installation so i dont mess it up this time ? :(
[07:34] <dabaR> necrodrako: read your private message from ubotu
[07:34] <Lovloss> my setup is somewhat complicated
[07:34] <necrodrako> thank you
[07:34] <felixfoertsch> Good morning. Does anyone know why my notebook shows funny coloured lines on pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 for switching to console?
[07:34] <corevette> why can't i see this xhtml file:  why can't i see this: http://micahman.50webs.com/enzon/xhtml.xhtml
[07:34] <felixfoertsch> And simply does not switch INTO the console.
[07:35] <peerless> what irc client do you guys suggest for linux?
=== cyber is now known as Cyber_Stalker
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> <>Oi*Pc#|h89+f
[07:35] <wavefunction> peerless: irssi
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> %*(&#$4
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> #()*#$#&$^
[07:35] <corevette> peerless, i use xchat, which i think is pretty solid
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> WRAR!
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> damit
[07:35] <floating_> dabaR: I formatted a ntfs partition, and it has ntfs options by default. at least I have to change the ntfs to ext3, and mount point. then there is following defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1 ,is that ok to leave?
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> this thing irratates me!
[07:35] <peerless> yeah..im using xchat now
[07:35] <peerless> its alright
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> ok
[07:35] <Cyber_Stalker> i feel better now
[07:35] <corevette> peerless, are you using the xchat-gnome or the xchat
[07:35] <peerless> xchat-gnome
[07:35] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: perhaps the resolution is wrong, do you see the usplash screen on startup?
[07:36] <corevette> peerless, try xchat regular, i like it better than gnome, i recently switched
[07:36] <peerless> okay, this is my first time using linux
[07:36] <peerless> now sure how to get it
[07:36] <Lovloss> Okay so anywayy... i have an external and internal drive. HDA1 is swap, HDA2 is root, SDA2 is home. SDA1 should mount on /media/sda1  and my other internal, HDB1, should mount on /media/hdb1. Is there anythingw rong with this logic?
[07:36] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: usplash is the "ubuntu" thingy with the loading bar?
[07:36] <dabaR> corevette: what do you mean you can not see it?
[07:36] <peerless> can i just do it through the package manager thing
[07:36] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: yes
[07:36] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Jep, I do see it. But it has strang colours, too.
[07:36] <felixfoertsch> *strange
[07:37] <felixfoertsch> But X works fine. Set up the resolution to 1680x1050 yesterday - and X works.
[07:37] <corevette> dabar, it doesn't show up as a webpage
[07:37] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: I will find you a link, and you will have to play with setting a different resolution for the usplash.
[07:37] <dabaR> corevette: cause it has a .xhtml extension and your browser displays those as not-web-pages.
[07:38] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Thanks. Is the console (CTRL+ALT+F1) depending on the usplash settings?
[07:38] <Lovloss> oh, and hd0 is the same as hda right?
[07:38] <corevette> dabaR, i've tried firefox/knoqueror/opera
[07:38] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: well, I am not sure of this whole thing, but I had a similar issue, you can try this./
[07:39] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Will do. Thanks.
[07:39] <nothlit> FeistyFawn, no, you can increase the resolution of the virtual consoles with vga=xxx...you'll need the proper code for your res/color settings
[07:39] <dabaR> corevette: is this your file?
[07:39] <corevette> dabar yes
[07:39] <nothlit> They both use the framebuffer though
[07:39] <Lovloss> no one can help me? i always emss up installations :'(
[07:40] <dabaR> corevette: rename it to .html
[07:40] <floating_> if I want to change the mount point to like simply /a ,how bad is that ?
[07:40] <corevette> dabar, but i want xhtml
[07:40] <floating_> it would be faster to write in cmd line
[07:40] <floating_> than /media/hda5
[07:40] <dabaR> Lovloss: Lovloss seems like fine logic
=== mako_ is now known as mako
[07:41] <LoneShadow> anyone using a livecd on a usb stick drive ?
[07:41] <dabaR> corevette: you want what xhtml? xhtml files have html extensions.
[07:41] <Lovloss> dabaR: and if i allow it to put GRUB on "hd0" thatll probably go to hda2 ownt it (hda1 is swap)
[07:41] <corevette> dabar but some do have the xhtml extension
[07:41] <dabaR> Lovloss: it will go in the master boot record, which is not a partition like hda1 hda2 or anything like that, afaik.
[07:41] <felixfoertsch> Lovloss: Let me give you a suggestion. Just set up those harddrives in the installation process which your really do need. Mount the other ones afterwards.
[07:42] <Lovloss> Thats a good idea. :)
[07:42] <felixfoertsch> ;)
[07:42] <dabaR> corevette: why would you want that extension rather than html? your server likely sends a header to the browser that makes the browser interpret it as xml rather than html...
[07:42] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Did I miss the link?
[07:42] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: not yet:)
[07:42] <peerless> how do I get my x-chat to show the user list in a channel?
[07:42] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: *puh*
[07:42] <felixfoertsch> :D
[07:43] <felixfoertsch> peerless: XChat or Gnome-Xchat?
[07:43] <peerless> regular XChat
[07:43] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: open /boot/grub/menu.lst for editing
[07:43] <necrodrako> Totem cannot play this type of media (DVD) because you do not have the appropriate plugins to handle i
[07:43] <necrodrako> what plugin do i need
[07:43] <felixfoertsch> peerless: Just click at the right side of your screen, hold down mouse1 and move it to the left.
[07:43] <felixfoertsch> ;)
[07:43] <Lovloss> Actually, maybe I should put my /home on another partition of the internal... and use the external as data
[07:44] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Done.
[07:44] <peerless> felixfoertsch, doh.
[07:44] <dabaR> necrodrako: try totem-xine
[07:44] <Darksair> corevette verify you page @ w3.org
[07:44] <Darksair> corevette: verify you page @ w3.org
[07:44] <felixfoertsch> peerless: Worked? ^^
[07:44] <peerless> how about getting it to show @, + at the top of the list
[07:44] <peerless> yes worked
[07:45] <mista> is there a way to add lines of text into a file just from command line
[07:45] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: read the last part, "B. Manual (kernel-specific) GRUB configuration" of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto and add a vga setting, then reboot, see whether that helps any. Try all the settings, starting with the smaller ones. I hope this does not waste your time.
[07:45] <felixfoertsch> Now I did a good deed - so I'm the day off ;D
[07:45] <necrodrako> im unsing totem xine
[07:45] <dabaR> mista: yes. what is the absolute path of the file, and what do you want to add to it?
[07:45] <peerless> felixfoertsch, wait a sec?
[07:46] <peerless> felixfoertsch, how can I see who is @ and +
[07:46] <dabaR> necrodrako: and you installed the dvd packages?
[07:46] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Well, I surely did not choose linux because I want everything to go fast, but better :)
[07:46] <felixfoertsch> *faster
[07:46] <mista> i dont know just like something like a line into the sources.list file
[07:46] <Darksair> corevette: Commonly, web servers will have a mapping of filename extensions (such as ".html") to MIME  Content-Type values (such as text/html).
[07:47] <nothlit> dabaR, rofl try all the settings?
[07:47] <dabaR> nothlit: there are 4
[07:47] <Cyber_Stalker> i have an issue, i created a launcher on my desktop with "sudo /home/cyber/Desktop/pure-ftpd-1.0.21/src/./pure-ftpd" as the command, but when i double click the launcher it doesnt start the ftpd, what am i doing wrong? or is there another way i should be doing this?
[07:47] <felixfoertsch> peerless: Uh, don't know, don't care. In the freenode channels channel ops just set their permission if they want to change something. They usually don't idle as ops :D
[07:47] <nothlit> felixfoertsch, if you have 1024 use 791 not 792 because 792 doesn't support vesa
[07:47] <dabaR> mista: echo "I add this line" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list is the command you could use. Make sure you have the tee -a, cause just tee will overwrite the file.
[07:47] <necrodrako> which ones
[07:48] <necrodrako> gstreamer stuff?
[07:48] <dabaR> !pureftpd
[07:48] <felixfoertsch> nothlit: Uh? Do I have to be able to follow this? ^^
[07:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pureftpd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:48] <mista> so where abouts do i had in the text?
[07:48] <dabaR> !pure-ftpd
[07:48] <ubotu> pure-ftpd: Pure-FTPd FTP server. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.21-5ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 150 kB, installed size 460 kB
[07:48] <dabaR> Cyber_Stalker: you should install that package.
[07:48] <nothlit> felixfoertsch, no just follow what what number i said if your res is 1024x768
[07:48] <Cyber_Stalker> dabaR, its installe, isnt it?
[07:49] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: yes, after you read the wiki page it should be clear what he said.

[07:49] <Cyber_Stalker> oh that
[07:49] <felixfoertsch> Oh okay, will do that now! Thx dabaR, thx nothlit!
[07:49] <Darksair> !help
[07:49] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[07:49] <dabaR> Cyber_Stalker: you compiled it from source?
[07:49] <anandanbu> hi the update feature on the FireFox is disabled in my Ubuntu Dapper Drake how do i correct it
[07:49] <Cyber_Stalker> dabaR, yes i did, how will i go about removing it now =D
[07:49] <nothlit> anandanbu, its supposed to be disabled
[07:50] <nothlit> anandanbu, you're supposed to update through ubuntu
[07:50] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: The screen of the notebook is 1680x1050 - it's not listed there. What to do? :D
[07:50] <dabaR> Cyber_Stalker: did you use sudo make install to install?
[07:50] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: like I said, try all of the values.
[07:50] <Cyber_Stalker> afaik yes
[07:50] <anandanbu> is it with the help of synaptic or somethin else
[07:50] <nothlit> I wonder how many people would ask about iceweasel/where firefox went if ubuntu had the same issue as debian
[07:50] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Oh, okay.
[07:51] <nie> hello
[07:51] <nothlit> felixfoertsch, theres tables that include more resolutions if you google for them
[07:51] <Cyber_Stalker> lol dabaR  i think i did, woudlnt i have to?
[07:51] <nothlit> felixfoertsch, but 1680x1050 isn't something that would be supported, you'll have to go for whatevers closest but still below your res
[07:52] <Cyber_Stalker> dabaR,  if i cd to that dir and type ./pure-ftpd it runs
[07:52] <mista> nice thanks
[07:52] <dabaR> Cyber_Stalker: there is no convenient way that I know of to uninstall it. You should from now on use checkinstall to install software from source, as it creates a .deb package and installs it. That way it is easy to remove. checkinstall is not installed on ubuntu by default but is in the repos.
[07:52] <felixfoertsch> nothlit: Okay.
[07:52] <Darksair> ubotu, ati > me
[07:52] <Cyber_Stalker> ok
[07:52] <Willa> Morning gang.
[07:53] <Willa> How do I get a wireless connection setup? The only connections are *WIRED* and *MODEM*. I swapped my ubuntu HD into a new computer. it used to have a wireless option setup.   The ODD part is the net WAS working for a bit.
[07:53] <dabaR> Cyber_Stalker: if you install pure-ftpd from the repos, it will start at boot, I think.
[07:53] <nothlit> !wireless | Willa
[07:53] <ubotu> Willa: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[07:53] <Cyber_Stalker> i dont want it to start at boot tho :/
[07:54] <nothlit> ubotu is the greatest thing ever
[07:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is the greatest thing ever - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:54] <Cyber_Stalker> i want it when i need it kinda thing :/ i dont awnt it running all the time, altho i know it is secure
[07:54] <Willa> nothlit: will that really help...
[07:54] <nothlit> Willa, it should, I haven't installed ubuntu on any computers with wireless so I couldn't tell you for sure
[07:54] <dabaR>  Cyber_Stalker not sure what to tell you then. what is the error you get with the launcher?
[07:54] <necrodrako> how do i install libdvdcss
[07:55] <Cyber_Stalker> no error
[07:55] <Cyber_Stalker> it doesnt launch
[07:55] <nothlit> !plf | necrodrako
[07:55] <ubotu> necrodrako: PLF is the Penguin Liberation Front. For more info see: http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf. PLF is down indefinitely pending a new maintainer; see http://plf.zarb.org/. see also !seveas

[07:56] <Cyber_Stalker> dabaR, thing is now i need pure-ftp from the repository's, its not in synaptic, but how would i go about getting it?
[07:56] <dabaR> necrodrako: get the libdvdcss package form the Seveas repository, and double click it
[07:56] <Cyber_Stalker> sudo apt-get pure-ftpd gives me an error
[07:56] <dabaR> Cyber_Stalker: are you sure you have universe enabled? what is the error?
[07:56] <felixfoertsch> dabaR, nothlit: Should I keep the aspect ratio?
[07:56] <Cyber_Stalker> E: Invalid operation pure-ftpd
[07:57] <dabaR> Cyber_Stalker: sudo apt-get install pure-ftpd
[07:57] <Cyber_Stalker> lol
[07:57] <Cyber_Stalker> im an idiot
[07:57] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: show us your menu.lst file before you reboot, on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:57] <nothlit> felixfoertsch, do it however you feel best

[07:57] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Okay. Will do so :)
[07:57] <ismail> :(

[07:57] <Cyber_Stalker> dabaR, it cant find the package
[07:58] <dabaR> !universe > Cyber_Stalker
[07:58] <Cyber_Stalker> thanks
[07:58] <Ilovemypuppy> is ubuntu a good choice for a mission critical server?
[07:58] <kleinlappies> ahoy everyone
[07:58] <bernhard> witch repo must i enable to get skype?
[07:59] <tomasz> hey all
[07:59] <kleinlappies> does anyone know of a vob (dvd) to avi or mpeg converter
[07:59] <Joe_CoT> bernhard: multiverse i believe
[07:59] <bernhard> Joe_CoT: thx :)
[07:59] <nothlit> Ilovemypuppy, I would rather install debian stable or openbsd

[07:59] <Ilovemypuppy> yeah im having issues with debian stable
[08:00] <dsnyders> How do I list only the directories, like dir /a:d in DOS?
[08:00] <felixfoertsch> dabaR, nothlit: Just found a tutorial for exact this problem - it uses "hwinfo" to get the right code.
[08:00] <nothlit> Cyber_Stalker, you need to enable the extra repos
[08:00] <Joe_CoT> Ilovemypuppy: define mission critical. I use Dapper for all my servers, and I've never had any problems
[08:00] <nothlit> !repos | Cyber_Stalker
[08:00] <ubotu> Cyber_Stalker: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[08:00] <Ilovemypuppy> Joe_CoT, how long have you been using dapper on your servers?
[08:00] <nothlit> felipe, congrats
[08:00] <noiesmo> dsnyders, man ls maybe ls -al /path/to/directory

[08:01] <ubotu> blaa: gpg is the GNU Privacy Guard.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto
[08:01] <Ilovemypuppy> Joe_CoT, by mission critical i mean not needing constant updates, or at least the updates wont require constant maintenance
[08:01] <CientificoLoco> where do I download news skins for my amsn?
[08:01] <Serial> !gpg | r0cks
[08:01] <ubotu> r0cks: gpg is the GNU Privacy Guard.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto
[08:01] <Joe_CoT> Ilovemypuppy: Since it came out. before that I was using breezy. We use Dapper for all our development work. There's two servers: ubuntu Dapper and freebsd. The Dapper one is far less of a pain
[08:02] <Joe_CoT> Ilovemypuppy: the only real updates are security updates, which you'll want to do. It's true for any linux server.
[08:02] <dsnyders> noiesmo, no, that lists all the files in /path/to/directory, be they files or directories.
[08:02] <Ilovemypuppy> Joe_CoT, thank you :) now lets hope libaa output in mplayer works
[08:02] <Joe_CoT> ilovemypuppy: libaa output? i think i answered your forum question about this
[08:02] <Doow> Anyone know what's up with the major upgrade/renaming of X today?
[08:02] <Ilovemypuppy> Joe_CoT, wasnt me, i havent been posting in any forums
[08:03] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: but it was related to this same thing I linked you to?
[08:03] <Doow> in edgy that is
[08:03] <Catshrimp> Any idea as to why the repository team goes to so much length as to describe how the security team will not audit the universe repository, but then adds dapper-security universe lines to the bottom of the sources.list file? =P
[08:03] <Joe_CoT> ilovemypuppy: ah, ok. yeah, i've had no issues with mplayer on the dapper server, which is good, since it's critical to our cms
[08:03] <noiesmo> dsnyders, you can do like ls /path/directory | grep thisname that will only show files or folders with thisname in it
[08:04] <Ilovemypuppy> Joe_CoT, its critical to me to make sure i can keep an eye on things
[08:04] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: It's about setting the VGA mode, yes. But it does not use the number with three characters, but a combination like 0x0307. The tutorial sas that this is used for Dapper Drake and later Ubuntu versions.
[08:04] <felixfoertsch> *sais
[08:04] <Catshrimp> Though on a less silly tone, anyone know what issues may be causing the respository team from including dnsmasq from the main respository?
[08:04] <felixfoertsch> *says -.-
[08:04] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: cool, thanks for the follow up.
[08:04] <mneptok> Catshrimp: CYA
[08:04] <Ilovemypuppy> i can get mplayer working with aalib output sort of in debian, but I just end up getting the status line and only a frame or two
[08:05] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Well thanks for your help :D
[08:05] <x-r00t-x> hey guys. is there any way to see command on terminal from remote pc?
[08:05] <Catshrimp> mneptok: huh?
[08:05] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: :D
[08:05] <nothlit> Ilovemypuppy, just make it so updating is automatic? and choose dapper because its LTS, so you won't have to replace/upgrade it as often... should have 5 years for servers i think
[08:05] <bernhard> thx dabaR
[08:05] <mneptok> Catshrimp: that was re: the first question.
[08:05] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Did I mention how cool the ubuntu community is? ;D
[08:05] <x-r00t-x> i just mean to say spy on remote pc without password
[08:05] <Ilovemypuppy> nothlit, LTS?
[08:05] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: hehe...
[08:05] <Ilovemypuppy> Ubuntu with Long Term Support
[08:05] <Ilovemypuppy> i hope thats a good thing
[08:05] <Catshrimp> mneptok: is CYA supposed to be an acronym that I should know?
[08:06] <Doow> x-r00t-x: yes, there are ways, but I dunno what's the policy on teaching such stuff.. =)
[08:06] <Ilovemypuppy> Catshrimp, its from the military, it means cover your rear end
[08:06] <nothlit> Ilovemypuppy, updates can be logged and whatnot for you to check on
[08:07] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: I added the settings at the "defoptions"; do I have to add them to the kernel line, too?
[08:07] <Catshrimp> Ilovemypuppy: thanks, just google and found out the same :)
[08:07] <Ilovemypuppy> nothlit, this is looking good, a definite improvement from 2 years ago
[08:07] <Catshrimp> mneptok: it was a /somewhat/ valid question ;)
[08:07] <necrodrako> it wont let me install libdvdcss
[08:07] <dsnyders> noisemo, I think I may not have explained what I'm after very well.  I want a command that gives me a list of just the folders within a directory.
[08:07] <Ilovemypuppy> i love my fast access, it takes a couple of minutes to download a whole iso
[08:08] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: well, no, it seems one or the other, but you have to run grub-update or so, follow the wiki to make sure.
[08:08] <Ilovemypuppy> it was only a year or two ago where an iso would take hours
[08:08] <Doow> dsnyders: man ls ^^
[08:08] <Catshrimp> And now it takes minutes :D
[08:08] <Catshrimp> Thank god for broadband!
[08:09] <SchalaBrandford> Im having trouble mounting a hard drive. i tried using the FAQ, but it failed me.  :( ive used sudo mount and the diskmounter script, but got nothin. :?
[08:09] <Catshrimp> In regards to the dnsmasq question, I'm just wondering if it's license oriented or bug oriented
[08:09] <dabaR> Catshrimp: how about... http://ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components
[08:09] <dabaR> Catshrimp: it talks about what goes where.
[08:10] <Catshrimp> dabaR: thanks, I'll give it a lookover :)
[08:10] <dabaR> SchalaBrandford: to mount something, you need to know the device node, and the mount point. Do you know those for sure already?
=== c0 is now known as ce_sk_music
[08:10] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Hm. Set it to 640x400 (to keep my aspect ratio 16:10). Now the console works fine, but the usplash has stil the old size - how to get the thing smaller? ^^
[08:11] <SchalaBrandford> dabaR: i know its /dev/hdc1/ and /home/schala/desktop/documents
[08:11] <SchalaBrandford> are those what you mean?
[08:11] <felixfoertsch> Well the usplash shows only the upper left quarter ^^
[08:11] <dabaR> shnee: yes, good. And the file system type?
[08:11] <SchalaBrandford> XFS
[08:11] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: hm...should have gotten changed, try adding the vga line to the usplash kernel line :-/
[08:12] <dsnyders> Doow, I can't seem to find anything within man ls.  It doesn't seem to have the capability to list only the directories.
[08:12] <SchalaBrandford> i noticed diskmounter assumed it was NTFS, so i made that change already. im gonna reboot and come back. :)
[08:12] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Well - can't I just remove it?
[08:12] <dabaR> SchalaBrandford: reboot why?
[08:12] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Don't need it anyway.
[08:12] <dabaR> felixfoertsch: the usplash? then just ignore it...
[08:12] <dabaR> or remove.
[08:12] <SchalaBrandford> Daba: so my fstab can run again? unless theres a better way
[08:13] <felixfoertsch> dabaR: Well, will find a tutorial about that. Don't want to waste any more of your time :) BIG THX!
[08:13] <Doow> dsnyders: hmm.. was sure there was something, you can use "ls -l | grep ^d" though I guess
[08:13] <felixfoertsch> Also to you nothlit! BIG THX.
[08:13] <peerless> just installed ubuntu, do I need to setup my video card drivers? cause resizing windows is laggy right now

[08:13] <Doow> dsnyders: although that might be a bit too verbose
[08:13] <Doow> dsnyders: depending on what you're doing
[08:14] <dsnyders> Doow, the ^d means "starting with d"?
[08:14] <nothlit> peerless, if you want faster resizing probably

[08:14] <necrodrako> why can i install libdvdcss?
[08:15] <dsnyders> Doow, that might work.  Odd that ls doesn't have the capability.  It seems to be able to do everything else.
[08:15] <SchalaBrandford> fark. -.-
[08:15] <Doow> dsnyders: yeah, I was surprised too
[08:15] <Catshrimp> dabaR: very helpful.  much obliged!

[08:16] <Doow> dsnyders: ls -F is pretty good to have as default too, makes it easier to see what's directories (maybe that's enabled by default in ubuntu though)
[08:16] <nothlit> SchalaBrandford, oh lol congrats
[08:16] <SchalaBrandford> Nothlit: that was a legitimate thanks
[08:16] <nothlit> SchalaBrandford, i don't doubt it lol

[08:17] <ubun> how come when i try to copy text from Gnome Terminal it's not showing up when I paste (whatever was last in my 'clipboard' still pastes)?
[08:17] <SchalaBrandford> dabaR: well, now the problem is that i reran the fstab and it STILL dosent work, lol
[08:17] <dabaR> ubun: how do you copy text from the terminal?
[08:18] <dabaR> SchalaBrandford: you should post fstab, and output of sudo fdisk -l to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[08:18] <ubun> i tried ctrl+shift+c and right clicking and selecting 'copy' from the menu
[08:18] <mneptok> ubun: is the terminal still open when you try?
[08:18] <ubun> after highlighting the text with my mouse
[08:18] <ubun> yes
[08:18] <dsnyders> Doow, I use the colors (ls --color) to distinguish files from folders.
[08:18] <noiesmo> ubun, you should select it then use edit copy fom menu
[08:18] <ubun> i did that

[08:20] <Ilovemypuppy> so 6.10 is the "development" branch and 6.06 is "stable"?
[08:20] <necrodrako> how am i saposed to contact him

[08:21] <FatherLavaGuard> I'd like to copy some avi TV episodes to a DVD (to play on a DVD player) what is the best Ubuntu program to use to do this?
[08:21] <SchalaBrandford> DabaR: Okay, heres sudo fdisk -l : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35732/
[08:21] <CorpseFeeder> I dont' think my DVD drive is mounted entirely correctly. Totem keeps telling me "Failed to mount /dev/hdc" And no disc icon appears when I insert a DVD in the drive. What have I got set up wrong?
[08:21] <bernhard> thx Community, Skype runs
[08:21] <wsjunior> mneptok: is there any tutorial for do this?
[08:21] <mneptok> Ilovemypuppy: no, both Edgy and Dapper are released. one is current, one is not. Dapper has a 3 year support cycle on the desktop, 5 years in the server closet. Edgy has 18 months.

[08:22] <CorpseFeeder> gxine will play DVDs no problem, but totem - I can't even get it to find the DVD drive? What's going on?
[08:22] <nothlit> ubun, have you tried restarting X?
[08:22] <ubun> no
[08:22] <mneptok> wsjunior: sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install sun-java5-plugin
[08:22] <noiesmo> FatherLavaGuard, if your dvd player supports avi which i doubt then you will first need to convert them from avi to mpeg and then dvdauthor them so you can then burn them with a burner
[08:22] <Ilovemypuppy> mneptok, whats the reason for this?
[08:22] <mneptok> wsjunior: ping when that's done
[08:22] <ubun> my downloads would be hosed

[08:23] <necrodrako> thank you

[08:23] <Ilovemypuppy> mneptok, damn fine stuff. Confusing. but fine.
[08:23] <Catshrimp> Okay guys, time to shut the eyes for a bit.  I'll see you all later :)!
[08:24] <nothlit> peerless, ubuntu doesn't run on xfree, it runs on x.org apt-cache show xserver-xorg
[08:24] <Ilovemypuppy> ubuntu uses debians basic system tools right? apt-get and the such?
[08:24] <nothlit> Ilovemypuppy, that is correct

[08:27] <noiesmo> FatherLavaGuard, np
[08:27] <nothlit> peerless, linux has file permissions to make it more safe, and that includes preventing things from executing
[08:27] <necrodrako> yes, it works now too thank you

[08:43] <nothlit> SchalaBrandford, only ext2/ext3, and ext3 only as ext2
[08:43] <nothlit> SchalaBrandford, also a unrecommended reiserfs way, and I seriously don't recommend it
[08:43] <CorpseFeeder> ahh.. I made an error. My DVD drive IS in the fstab file, the CD drive is NOT listed. /dev/hdc is in there (my DVD) but /dev/hda is not in there (my CD)
[08:43] <nothlit> SchalaBrandford, you can use FAT
[08:43] <cmt^^> awake
[08:43] <nothlit> SchalaBrandford, fat is readable by both linux and windows pretty well
[08:44] <SchalaBrandford> but that involves formatting, and i dont have a space 100gb anywhere.
[08:44] <SchalaBrandford> spare*
[08:44] <zeeble> hi. I installed Ubuntu proper, then i apt-getted the xubuntu-desktop meta package, but i use the normal Gnome session. I would like gdm to start, and take me to the normal GDM splash screen, and not the one that shows the xubuntu mouse.. how do i do that?
[08:44] <SchalaBrandford> ah well, no biggie. im gonna go do it now, so i gotta /quit. :)
[08:44] <CorpseFeeder> so, I will rephrase... is it normal to have my DVD drive listed in fstab and not the CD drive?
[08:44] <nothlit> SchalaBrandford, if you haven't used encryption or compression linux can use ntfs filesystems for writing too... ubuntuguide.org

[08:45] <zeeble> loca|host: ubuntu-desktop is just a meta package.
[08:45] <zeeble> loca|host: it wont remove "gnome" or all that.
[08:45] <nothlit> zeeble, gksudo gdmsetup

[08:52] <CorpseFeeder> I don't know what I'm doing.
[08:52] <Lovloss> *right
[08:53] <Byan> Lovloss: uhm.. 64k cache is really low...

[08:56] <Lovloss> Byan: It says it is! its AMD Duron
[08:56] <CorpseFeeder> erm... okay.... If I click the "play DVD" button in System>Administration>Disk Manager, totem launches and plays the DVD in the drive, BUT if I start totem first then select the play dvd disc it tells me "failed to mount /dev/hdc" wtf is going on?
[08:56] <Arafangion> Why are various services suddenly restarting, such as cups, and now the logging service?
[08:56] <Lovloss> Byan: Model 8

[08:56] <Akuma_> tonyyarusso: de nada
[08:57] <Lovloss> Byan: just an old AMD?
[08:57] <nothlit> CorpseFeeder, either totem shouldn't be trying to mount it or it isnt using pmount properly
[08:57] <Byan> Lovloss: yes
[08:57] <Lovloss> Byan: its cpu speed is only 1.5 ghz
[08:57] <CorpseFeeder> what is pmount? is it something I can fix?
[08:57] <Byan> well, yeah, if it's a duron, the cache could be that low
[08:57] <rebelfallen> Guys I need to search for a string in * files on my machine, then replace that string in every file in a specific dir. Any ideas?
[08:57] <Byan> but no AMD64 has cache that low
[08:58] <Arafangion> 1.5GHz is so damn fast these days.

[09:49] <Lovloss> nothlit: Should i install a new nvidia driver or legacy? I think i might need legacy since its a 5500.
[09:49] <Lovloss> nothlit: or will getting aixgl take care of that
[09:49] <nothlit> Lovloss, you'll need to consult nvidia's website

[10:01] <Tmob> how do i forward X session in ubuntu shell?
[10:01] <Tmob> i sshed into a remote machine, and it wont open a gtk app
[10:01] <rausb0> Tmob: ssh -Y user@hostname
[10:01] <Tmob> asks for DISPLAY.. and i set it to myip:0
[10:01] <Tmob> oh lemme try
[10:01] <lyy> jsut installed ubuntu Linux ubuntu 2.6.15-26-386 how do i install mplayer?
[10:01] <Tmob> Please set the DISPLAY variable
[10:01] <cmt^^> How do I filter out quits/joins/parts in irssi?
[10:01] <cmt^^> !mplayer | lyy
[10:01] <ubotu> lyy: mplayer is a media player. Enable multiverse repo and type sudo apt-get install mplayer for more info please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer  To compile it from source see:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer/Compile

[10:01] <slimm5> hello ! sorry, im spech english very bad, but im have one questions ;-) im have TV-tuner Fly2000 with base chip Philips 7134. in ubuntu this tnot support ?
[10:02] <Tmob> lyy, apt-cache search mplayer
[10:02] <Tmob> lyy, then pick the package u want
[10:02] <rausb0> Tmob: no, the DISPLAY must be set from ssh itself
[10:02] <floating_> how to remove all files inside a dir ? rm -r just ?
[10:02] <Tmob> rausb0, hmm i used -Y
[10:02] <slimm5> thot=thinks
[10:02] <floating_> rmdir -r ?
[10:02] <rausb0> Tmob: then the ssh server may be disallowing X forwarding
[10:02] <floating_> I am scared of -r in rm command
[10:02] <rausb0> Tmob: look into /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the remote machine
[10:02] <Tmob> rausb0, ooh
[10:03] <UHU1> HELP, is there a way to autodetect hardware each time ubuntu is rebooted ?
[10:03] <Tmob> X11Forwarding no
[10:03] <bledy> nothlit, thank you, I installed it and is working correctly.
[10:03] <Tmob> rausb0, you are right.. thanks
[10:03] <nothlit> bledy, i'm glad :)
[10:03] <sushi_> floating to remove all the files in a directory its: rm *
[10:03] <sushi_> floating or: rm /nameofdir/*
[10:04] <floating_> how about removing a dir, that has files in it
[10:04] <floating_> and subdirs
[10:04] <Willa> is nvidia-glx the videocard driver?
[10:04] <sushi_> floating then its rm -rf /directory
[10:04] <Willa> Im getting staggering playback with dvds.
[10:04] <UHU1> HELP, is is possible to autodetect hardware each time ubuntu is rebooted (as if running a Live CD mode) ?
[10:04] <floating_> thanks
[10:05] <rausb0> Tmob: setting the DISPLAY variable manually to your ip address only works if you are not behind a nat gateway. and you give the remote host permission to display on your local X server.
[10:05] <nothlit> do not do not ever use rm *
[10:05] <floating_> why not ? I use it alot
[10:05] <Tmob> rausb0, the permission giving is done how?
[10:05] <rausb0> Tmob: xhost +remote_hostname
[10:05] <Tmob> as root?
[10:05] <rausb0> Tmob: no, as user
[10:06] <Tmob> oh ok
[10:06] <Tmob> well i changed the sshd_config and its working now :)
[10:06] <rausb0> Tmob: ah okay
[10:06] <Tmob> why not use -X ?
[10:06] <SeyToN> how do i know if ndiswrapper is running or not?
[10:06] <Tmob> instead of -Y ?
[10:06] <rausb0> Tmob: -Y is more secure
[10:06] <Tmob> yea i see "trusted" in man page but not much explanation
[10:07] <Tmob> is it secure because X communication is also encrypted?
[10:07] <rausb0> Tmob: otherwise users from on the remote machine could gaindisplay permission on your X server
[10:07] <Tmob> oh really!?
[10:07] <Tmob> how so?
[10:07] <nothlit> floating_, cause depending on how you use it it could delete far more than you intended
[10:07] <rausb0> Tmob: forwarded X in ssh is always encrypted, with -X and -Y
[10:08] <floating_> I have a strange problem :( I formatted ntfs to ext3. tried to fstab it, but on the boot there was an error about the UI=1341421something, and said to look at fcsk in /var/log. I checked there afterwards and didnt see anything. Now the fstab doesnt mount the ext3 partition, but instead mounted something from other ext3 to the mount point
[10:08] <rausb0> Tmob: but there was some bug in the way -X works. i dont know exactly.
[10:08] <Tmob> rausb0, ok gotcha.. thanks for the explanation
[10:09] <Arafangi1n> floating_: Sounds like your /etc/fstab is mixed up.,
[10:09] <nothlit> rausb0, -Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.
[10:09] <nothlit> seems less safe
[10:09] <floating_> I dont know if I entered right values in fstab, just removed the values that were for ntfs, and wrote just "defaults" 0 0 for the new ext3
[10:10] <rausb0> nothlit: maybe the X11 SECURITY extension introduced the problem
[10:11] <SeyToN> hi
[10:11] <UHU1> ppl, is it possible to autodetect hardware each time ubuntu is rebooted (as if running a Live CD mode) ?
[10:11] <floating_> Arafangi1n: any suggestions ?
[10:11] <rausb0> UHU1: actually, the hardware _is_ detected on every reboot
[10:11] <nothlit> UHU1, what sort of hardware and are you using hard drive trays or something?
[10:11] <nothlit> rausb0, not things like partitions and drives
[10:11] <Arafangi1n> floating_: No, it's after 5pm, so my brain's switched off :(
[10:12] <rausb0> nothlit: okay. but thats reasonable. i dont want my fstab changed automatically.
[10:12] <floating_> hehe, ok
[10:13] <Arafangi1n> floating_: For all I know, ubuntu does a whole lot of wierd autodetection stuff.
[10:13] <UHU1> rausb0 & nothlit: I installed ubuntu on portable HDD so I can use on 2 laptops. It works find on 1 laptop, but failed to recognise driver on 2nd laptop
[10:13] <Arafangi1n> floating_: Maybe it's confused by your partition not being marked as ext3, for all I know.
[10:14] <nothlit> UHU1, why not install ubuntu on both laptops and use your portable HDD to store your home folder?
[10:14] <nothlit> failed to recognise what hardware?
[10:14] <floating_> I marked it as ext3 also.. forgot to mention that^^
[10:14] <rausb0> UHU1: maybe that hardware is not supported at all
[10:14] <UHU1> nothlit: actually I'm planning to use it on several PCs (2 laptop & 1 office PC), installing on all would be too much & I'd like to keep consistent settings.
[10:15] <UHU1> rausb0: it's supported, it runs of if use Live CD
[10:15] <rausb0> UHU1: okay
[10:15] <UHU1> rausb0: i mean runs ok
[10:15] <rausb0> UHU1: and which particular hardware is it?
[10:16] <nothlit> UHU1, keeping consistent settings is easy with a consistent home folder
[10:16] <UHU1> rausbo: so far, it's the video driver
[10:16] <RememberPOL> What's the point of having a non-root account on a single-user system?
[10:16] <SeyToN> hi, how do i know if ndiswrapper is running or not?
=== gradin_ is now known as gradin
[10:16] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: What's the point of using root?
[10:17] <Matthew> RememberPOL, security
[10:17] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: Root != administrator
[10:17] <RememberPOL> Arafangi1n: To make unrestricted system changes..
[10:17] <rausb0> UHU1: okay, so the xorg.conf file is not changed automatically
[10:17] <UHU1> nothlit: but I'm not allowed to install Linux on my office PC, so running from portable HDD would be good
[10:17] <Matthew> RememberPOL, just use sudo
[10:17] <Matthew> RememberPOL, or if you must, sudo -s
[10:17] <RememberPOL> Matthew: I know what to do but I'm asking about the philosophy..
[10:17] <UHU1> rausb0: I guess so.. (I dunno much about linux & xorg.conf stuff)
[10:17] <RememberPOL> In fact I just added NOPASSWD to my admin group in /etc/sudoers...
[10:17] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: With root, you have full access to *everything*, including the system memory and process heaps.
[10:17] <nothlit> I think livecd+unionfs would make the most sense
[10:17] <Matthew> ah, I think it is explained on the ubuntu website
[10:18] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: Far more than mere administrator.
[10:18] <UHU1> nothlit: unionfs ?? what's that.. wait I'll google it
[10:18] <RememberPOL> As if i'm just coming off windows
[10:18] <RememberPOL> Arafangi1n: I know.
[10:18] <rausb0> UHU1: i guess you'd have to build you own initscript to choose the right xorg.conf depending on which machine the system is booted
[10:18] <nothlit> RemoteViewer, but don't run sudo -s with graphical apps... you need gksudo or sudo -i
[10:18] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: Consider that even Mac OS X forces the users to go the sudo route.
[10:19] <nothlit> RememberPOL, but don't run sudo -s with graphical apps... you need gksudo or sudo -i
[10:19] <rausb0> UHU1: but if you have little knowledge about commandline and shell scripting, it will be hard
[10:19] <nothlit> !sudo | RememberPOL
[10:19] <ubotu> RememberPOL: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:19] <UHU1> rausb0: err.. oh well.... maybe the sys admin @ my office can help
[10:19] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: So, what is your previous system?
[10:19] <nothlit> RememberPOL, the point of not using root so a user compromise doesn't compromise the whole system
[10:19] <RememberPOL> Matthew: When you say security... exactly who is one's system susceptible to with only a root account..?
[10:20] <UHU1> rausb0 & nothlit: thanks for your help.. & i'll do more research on google
[10:20] <Matthew> RememberPOL, outside forces...ie. crackers, scriptkiddies, etc
[10:20] <Matthew> w/o a root account, outside forces must use sudo, which leaves a nice little trail
[10:20] <RememberPOL> nothlit: I get that but if there is only one user with privileges to critical information (single user system) and it gets compromised... that's basically a whole-system hack.
[10:21] <sindrum> any ideas on how i can have startup programs start minimized in notification area?
[10:21] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: Not really, they still need to figure out how to get root.
[10:21] <nothlit> RememberPOL, only if they can grab the pw for sudo
[10:22] <RememberPOL> Matthew: I really think it has more to do with potential pitfalls in software installation.. but that's hardly merited either.
[10:22] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: With root, not even the deteted files can be considered safe.
[10:22] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: Just grep the entire HDD, and you got passwords :)
[10:22] <dirge> Hello everyone.
[10:22] <Arafangi1n> Though, why would they bother, once they already have root...)
[10:22] <RememberPOL> Anything I install will be packaged for my system so there's hardly no chance of a poor coder using some command intended for a different system setup, resulting in negative things.
[10:22] <RememberPOL> Heh
[10:23] <Matthew> oh man, I downloaded the ubuntu edgy, not the kubuntu edgy...and I don't like doing the sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop thing either...oh well, here we go again
[10:23] <Unknown404> hmm
[10:23] <RememberPOL> lol
[10:23] <Unknown404> tux-racer, do i have to compile it from source?
[10:23] <Arafangi1n> RememberPOL: I would like a OpenBSD "variant" on linux - ie, one that is essentially exactly OpenBSD, except for the kernel itself.
[10:24] <Unknown404> i have tried sudo apt-get install tuxracer but it doesnt kow what packeage it is

[10:24] <Unknown404> so i dont think its in the repositorys
[10:24] <tonyyarusso> Unknown404: planetpenguin-racer
[10:24] <Catshrimp> Arafangi1n: you would take the linux kernel over the BSD kernel? Bwahahaha
[10:24] <nothlit> Unknown404, tux racer is deprecated
[10:24] <dirge> Anyone got a good recommendation on a uber-fast linux tutorial book? I don't like the ones that drag on.
[10:25] <Arafangi1n> Catshrimp: Over the OpenBSD kernel, sure.
[10:25] <nothlit> Arafangi1n, err... openbsd kernel is much more secure
[10:25] <Arafangi1n> nothlit: That it is, but it's also much slower.
[10:25] <Catshrimp> dirge: I've heard that the Ubuntu Book is pretty good, though never looked through it.
[10:25] <Catshrimp> Arafangi1n: why? (now I'm curious) :)
[10:25] <nothlit> theres also a famous book for mepis
[10:25] <Arafangi1n> Catshrimp: Speed and portability :)
[10:26] <Arafangi1n> Catshrimp: imho, OpenBSD doesn't scale as high as linux does anymore :(
[10:26] <Unknown404> tonyyarusso, that the one i should use? nothlit, deprecated?
[10:26] <dirge> Catshrimp: I'm pretty much a linux n00b. I'm in an intermediate programming class and want to start programming for linux primarily.

[10:26] <tonyyarusso> Unknown404: Changed name, yep
[10:26] <Catshrimp> dirge: you'll want to learn c,perl,python
[10:26] <dirge> Arafangi1n: Well, everyone seems to like C++, but I'm messing around with Java just to be diffrent.
[10:27] <dirge> Arafangi1n: I can do most any language.
[10:27] <Catshrimp> dirge: c++ is good too
[10:27] <Unknown404> all this downloading im doing :/
[10:27] <Arafangi1n> dirge: Are you joking?

[10:27] <Arafangi1n> dirge: Usually people say quite the reverse :)
[10:27] <dirge> Arafangi1n: No, I do realize Java works cross platforms, but I'd like to learn the Linux system so I can do C as well.
[10:27] <Catshrimp> No doubt about that
[10:27] <Lovloss> Is a GForce FX 5500 a legacy driver or a regular one?
[10:27] <Catshrimp> dirge: if you want a quick reference, check out oreilly's unix in a nutshell

[10:28] <dirge> Arafangi1n: Java is just so much easier. I spend 1-2 hours programming when the rest of the class takes days.
[10:28] <Arafangi1n> dirge: Realise that Java _is_ a platform.
[10:28] <Catshrimp> dirge: it covers gnu/linux unix solaris
[10:28] <Arafangi1n> dirge: They are probably taking days because they have yet to learn the STL.
[10:28] <zeeble> Hi. Which is the channel for the next planned Ubuntu release? Feisty Fawn?
[10:28] <Catshrimp> yep
[10:28] <dirge> Arafangi1n: the VM is a platform, but the apps I make I'd like to specialize in Linux.
[10:28] <nothlit> theres a reason why people don't use java, its slow
[10:28] <Arafangi1n> dirge: I suggest you move away from Java then.
[10:28] <Catshrimp> dirge: in order to run java you need the VM :)
[10:29] <Catshrimp> Java's nice to begin with
[10:29] <dirge> Arafangi1n: I'm using Java because the class is talking about simple stuff I already understand. (Linked Lists, Hashtables, etc)
[10:29] <Arafangi1n> dirge: Consider learning Python :)

[10:36] <Catshrimp> Unknown404: you need a server for those files :D
[10:36] <nothlit> dirge, ubuntu does the updating of it, and there are apps to do rss autoloading
[10:36] <Unknown404> oh lol thats what u ment
[10:37] <Catshrimp> =)
[10:37] <dirge> nothlit: I'd like it all in package rather than apps running all over the place.
[10:37] <Catshrimp> Unknown404: then you can just use it to store whatever so that you can use the workstation for work

[10:39] <Arafangion> frogzoo: Why do you want to?
[10:39] <ArwynH> frogzoo: it compiles at runtime.
[10:39] <frogzoo> Arafangion: cos then gnome would be 10x faster

[10:40] <frogzoo> Arafangion: I think I'll need some convincing on that proposition
[10:40] <ArwynH> python compiles at runtime and keeps the binaries. recompiles if there is a change. there will be no speed improvements.

[10:40] <Arafangion> frogzoo: Ask the #java guys why they don't compile their Java code.
[10:40] <ArwynH> dirge: er. not really. I like GNOME.
[10:40] <Catshrimp> CyberMad: if nothing else, it's a baseline.  You could also query wiki.ubuntu.com
[10:40] <ArwynH> Arafangion: bs. it will not be slower or faster.
[10:41] <kleinlappies> does anyone know of a vob (dvd) to avi or mpeg converter
[10:41] <frogzoo> Arafangion: why don't the java guys compile their java code?
[10:41] <dirge> frogzoo: Well, it semi-compiles.. It's Bitcode. Not machine level,
[10:41] <CyberMad> catisonh_ ahh.. thanks :)
[10:41] <Arafangion> *bytecode
[10:41] <dirge> Arafangion: Yeah. lol
[10:41] <ArwynH> frogzoo: they do. to java byte-code. it will run on any platform.
[10:42] <nothlit> dirge, i think kde is still the leading DE
[10:42] <ArwynH> frogzoo: you can compile to native code using gcj, but the speed improvement is not worth it.
[10:42] <Arafangion> frogzoo: The python VM is actually remarkably similar to the Java VM, apparently.
[10:42] <ArwynH> java is not slow.
[10:42] <dirge> nothlit: I've been thinking about using it more myself as well.
[10:42] <frogzoo> Arafangion: I know that - but you can compile java to machine code, with some performance gains
[10:42] <Arafangion> ArwynH: Actually, I was told that there is _no_ speed improvement, though gcj apps do often start faster.
[10:42] <CyberMad> i have ubuntu iso in my laptop.. is it possible to install ubuntu in my desktop PC without burn the iso to CD? maybe via LAN ?
[10:43] <Arafangion> frogzoo: If you have slow code, you make it faster, as simple as that. :)
[10:43] <dirge> CyberMad: Yes, it's possible, but it's not very fast. Just burn it.
[10:43] <nothlit> dirge, oh I wasn't thinking about it, I don't even use a DE
[10:43] <ArwynH> CyberMad: techniqualy, yes, but i wouldn't bother.
[10:43] <noiesmo> kleinlappies, I'm on kde so I use konqkonv is a KDE service menu which allows quick and easy conversion of video files (I've tried .avi, .mov and .mpg with it) into DVD or VCD compliant mpg files.
[10:43] <frogzoo> CyberMad: dude, burning the cd will be the easiest way
[10:43] <CyberMad> nothlit what DE ?
[10:43] <nothlit> CyberMad, I just said I don't use one rofl
[10:43] <Arafangion> Desktop Environment.
[10:44] <dirge> CyberMad: It's faster to burn, and then you have a CD that you can use as a live CD.
[10:44] <CyberMad> nothlit sorry.. hehe i don't understand your english joke... my english too worst! ;P
[10:44] <nothlit> CyberMad, no joke here
[10:44] <dirge> CyberMad: What's your language?

[10:46] <rausb0> nothlit: i've been using xfce 3.8 for some years. and xfce 4 on xubuntu.
[10:47] <rausb0> Catshrimp: yes, but only when running screen(1) :))
[10:47] <crazy_bus> I really like how in amarok you can pause a song with Windows key+C.  Do any gnome based players have the same functions?
[10:47] <rausb0> Arafangion: me too
[10:47] <nothlit> Catshrimp, just a volume desklet!!!
[10:47] <dirge> Well, test tomorrow. see ya everyone. Thanks for the help.
[10:47] <Catshrimp> ;) =P
[10:47] <nothlit> Catshrimp, id rather not use a dockapp or wait for a prog to launch... anyways theyre all incredibly lightweight
[10:48] <nothlit> would you rather I blow out my ears when theres an app with no volume control?
[10:48] <Catshrimp> nothlit: perhaps? =P

[10:55] <_JECKEL_> I wanna make sure a certian port stays open and listened for...how would I do that in ubuntu?
[10:58] <floating_> anyone familiar with uuid here ?
[10:58] <gavintu> simple question: Is there any difference between a full ubuntu install and ubuntu-server + ubuntu-desktop? i.e. does ubuntu-desktop just install gnome and the required libraries or will it install all of the apps that weren't included in ubuntu-server as well?
[10:58] <wijnand> does anyone know when adobe reader 8 will be in the ubuntu repositories?
[10:59] <Matthew> _JECKEL_, check out firestarter...it's a firewall.
[10:59] <Matthew> _JECKEL_, sudo apt-get install firestarter
[10:59] <ArwynH> gavintu: there are different options during the install, but you can get from a to b without re-installing.
[11:00] <gavintu> ArwynH: I'm mainly concerned about the filesize/excess libraries. I'm planning on reinstalling from scratch anyways.
[11:00] <y0ni> gavintu: these apps will be installed if u install ubuntu-desktop: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/metapackages/ubuntu-desktop
[11:00] <gavintu> y0ni: Thanks.

[11:11] <noiesmo> Arafangion, ??

[11:25] <mtyhome> hi
[11:25] <pielgrzym> I had problems with update from pl. one, so changed it to international and suddenly I can upgrade half of kde ;)
[11:25] <nothlit> but might not be as up to date
[11:25] <pielgrzym> well, it's not faster, so I'd better use the international one, right?

[11:30] <hc> i meant using the terminal
[11:31] <huibert> hc: do you mean like irc in an xterm?
[11:31] <hc> like Windows NT used the netsend command, does Ubuntu have something similar
[11:31] <huibert> hc: are more like email?
[11:31] <huibert> *or
[11:32] <cherubiel> hc: man smbclient
[11:32] <huibert> hc: there is an netsend package, wich will let you send windows like popups with samba
[11:32] <rausb0> hc: smbclient -M ...
[11:32] <ph8> how do i check the mail for my local user on a vanilla ubuntu system?
[11:32] <ph8> back in the day on my RH systems i used 'mail' but it doesn't exist - is there a default or do i need to install mail?
[11:32] <hc> thx guys
[11:34] <tonyyarusso> ph8: you can install it

[11:38] <lowell> from/to ?
[11:38] <tomix> the viewer is at 3.3 i need 3.889
[11:38] <quappa> i've built and installed newer gaim (2.0.0beta5) via checkinstall. Now aptitude suggests me to "upgrade" my gaim to 2.0.0+beta3. how can this be resolved?
[11:40] <lowell> could always ignore it
[11:40] <lowell> hehe
[11:41] <huibert> hc: like this: "cat mymessage.txt | smbclient -M NET_BIOS_NAME"
[11:42] <quappa> all other package tools report broken "ubuntu-desktop" and "nautilus-sendto" because of this gaim controversy.
[11:42] <huibert> !checkinstall
[11:42] <ubotu> checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall  -  Please: Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page. - DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[11:43] <hc> Huibert : I tried that but to no avail
[11:43] <hc> can the net bios name also be an ip address if i dont know the netbios name
[11:44] <huibert> hc: I don't know. how does it fail? what error message?
[11:45] <hc> Huibert : XP doesnt have the winpopup function built in so i guess thats why
[11:45] <hc> apperently according to the manuals u need winpopup running on the other machines
[11:45] <quappa> huibert, checkinstall works ok, but newer gaim doesn't "replace" the older. at least it seems not to do.
[11:45] <huibert> hc: yes, it does, but it is disabled by default (this is a _very_ good_ thing)
[11:46] <hc> how can i enable it again /
[11:46] <huibert> quappa: I was just wonderung what checkinstall actually does :-)
[11:46] <huibert> hc: I think you need to enable a "messenger" service. Maybe allow something in the firewall.
[11:47] <huibert> hc: it's a windows problem, I'm not really an expert with MS stuff, sorry
[11:47] <hc> ok kewl. will check it out. Thx for the info,
[11:47] <hc> Are u more into linux?
[11:47] <sladen> huibert: linpopup
[11:48] <sladen> ph8: apt-get install mail   or   less /var/spool/mail/$USER

[11:49] <ph8> cheers sladen
[11:49] <rausb0> huibert: same here
[11:49] <ph8> new question though
[11:49] <ph8> a mail i sent using sendmail was returned to me
[11:49] <ph8> in /var/spool/mail/myuser i've got the headers saying it was returned
[11:49] <huibert> hc: well, not quiet, I've only stopped using windows for gaming around 4 years ago :-)
[11:49] <hc> Thats good, Well i'm trying to Learn it now but what a hassle
[11:49] <ph8> are the contents of the message stored anywhere?
[11:50] <hc> Me, still stuck on the Dark side here
[11:50] <SoftIce> where can I run an insmod on boot before it reads /etc/init.d ?
[11:50] <huibert> hc: hassle? For me "working" with wondows (at work) is a real hassle
[11:50] <SoftIce> I cant use modprobe, I have to modprobe a device then insmod right after that, a path to a module
[11:50] <huibert> *windows
[11:51] <hc> Thats why i say it belongs on the Dark side (Windows)
[11:51] <huibert> SoftIce: afaik the module mist be pressent in the init.rd file, to be accessed before init, but I'm not sure
[11:51] <huibert> SoftIce: can't you compile the module into the kernel (not being a module anymore)?
[11:52] <pohpoh> this just in, you can divide by zero

[12:07] <huibert> !fish
[12:07] <ubotu> fish: a friendly interactive shell. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.21.12-1 (edgy), package size 631 kB, installed size 2560 kB
[12:07] <rausb0> justin_: i have that too. no problem so far.
[12:07] <justin_> Okie then
[12:08] <gundee> apt-index-watcher is getting on my nerves. every 5 seconds choking around 50% of my processor. disabled it for now. what is that thing good for anyways?
[12:08] <joga> when I try running sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart when in console, I get * Starting GNOME Display Manager...  [fail] , but when in recovery mode it starts the graphical login
[12:09] <Spee_Der> gundee: Can't you set the timer for that to say perhaps every four hours or something ?
[12:10] <huibert> justin_: I think it aybe that BASH like shells have been around for about 30 years, and may people know their way around in it.
[12:10] <huibert> justin_: that way, newbees can ask veterans questions about stuff veterans know :-)
[12:11] <tundejeg> hello
[12:11] <tundejeg> everybody
[12:11] <tundejeg> pls
[12:12] <tundejeg> can some one bear me out
[12:12] <huibert> !ask > tundejeg
[12:12] <tundejeg> of a problem
[12:12] <tundejeg> i tried
[12:12] <tundejeg> to login
[12:12] <justin_> Just ask your question
[12:12] <tundejeg> as a root
[12:12] <gundee> Spee_Der, i see no way i can adjust that. i guess i'll just keep it disabled for now.
[12:12] <tundejeg> with su -
[12:12] <tamer> Hi people! I think my ubuntu version somehow is damaged.... I neeed help!!!
[12:12] <huibert> !sudo
[12:12] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[12:12] <tundejeg> but when i enterd the password
[12:12] <Spee_Der> gundee: Ok, just a thought....
[12:12] <tundejeg> i got this error no shell
[12:12] <nisse> Oh my... Here are plenty of dumb ppl
[12:12] <tundejeg> how do i resolve it
[12:12] <huibert> tundejeg: you should not use "su -" in ubuntu, thats what sudo is for
[12:13] <owh> tamer: In what way is it damaged?
[12:13] <Spee_Der> tamer: How so ?
[12:13] <tundejeg> i tried sudo
[12:13] <tundejeg> too
[12:13] <nisse> gah..
[12:13] <tundejeg> it was telling me the same thing
[12:13] <tundejeg> no shell
[12:13] <huibert> tundejeg: qould you please write one sentence at the time, not 7 chunks of text?
[12:13] <huibert> *could
[12:13] <tundejeg> k
[12:14] <huibert> tundejeg: what was the precise error message, after "sudo su "
[12:15] <huibert> tundejeg: ooohhhh, I got an Idea, try "sudo su" not "sudo su -" (watch the minus sign)
=== jono_ is now known as Darst
[12:15] <owh> huibert: WTF are you trying to do?
[12:15] <eloquence_> w
[12:15] <tundejeg> it requested for password of which i wrote the password and i got the message "sorry try again"
[12:15] <eloquence_> mew
[12:15] <Darst> .
[12:16] <owh> huibert: Are you attempting to get a root-shell?
[12:16] <Darst> Strrange got  a msg saying I had to be nickserv registered but appears i have voice - can someone please confirm... aye ?
[12:16] <tundejeg> yes OWH
[12:16] <owh> eloquence_: Did you run kbsetup first?
[12:16] <owh> tundejeg: sudo bash
[12:17] <mneptok> Darst: you need to be registered and identified to send private messages
[12:17] <cappicrd> Hi
[12:17] <Darst> thx mneptok
[12:17] <owh> eloquence_: Are you the system administrator or a user on this machine?
[12:17] <eloquence_> well
[12:17] <eloquence_> i am the only user
[12:18] <eloquence_> and as far as i know it doesn't let me login as root
[12:18] <huibert> tundejeg: with sudo you have to enter _your_ password, not the root password.
[12:18] <owh> eloquence_: So, you setup the machine?
[12:18] <eloquence_> i ran kbsetup yes
[12:18] <eloquence_> yea
[12:18] <owh> eloquence_: So, did it find all the applications?
[12:18] <Darst> gotta a question now - to start, i apologise, am a newbie to *nix - first install but have go this far... (including getting my ati drivers working on my 40"lcd)... can someone suggest why i might be having X reboot itself each time i try to play media files (have tried both xvid and mp3 so far through VLC and Movie player - same response both times)
[12:18] <eloquence_> yea
[12:18] <owh> eloquence_: Did you run kbsetup as root, because if you did, it might have borked things.
[12:19] <eloquence_> there si a choice at the top to use some "group" ?
[12:19] <Kenas> hi
[12:19] <Kenas> how can i install unrar program ?
[12:19] <eloquence_> n
[12:19] <cappicrd> out of interest
[12:19] <chx> how could I tell apt that I have installed a package which replaces another? I have xserver-xorg-video-i810-modesetting instead of xserver-xorg-video-i810 and automatic updating is problematic.
[12:19] <eloquence_> well to get into kbsetup it asks u for root password
[12:19] <owh> eloquence_: Hmm.
[12:19] <eloquence_> wtf is a burning group?
[12:20] <owh> eloquence_: That's the group with permissions to burn a disc.
[12:20] <eloquence_> but where do i create the group
[12:20] <owh> Kenas: Launch Synaptic, search for unrar, install it.
[12:20] <eloquence_> cuz "burning" doesn't exist
[12:20] <owh> eloquence_: No, you shouldn't need to burn it.
[12:20] <owh> Duh
[12:20] <eloquence_> so i just entered my username as the name of the group and it accepted it
[12:20] <owh> eloquence_: You shouldn't need to create it.
[12:21] <eloquence_> i should go to the system settings > users & group smaybe?
[12:21] <BlackHawk> hi
[12:21] <owh> eloquence_: That should be fine from memory. k3b seems a little twitchy about permissions. I've not recently installed it. Last time I did I was running Debian Testing, these days I'm running Ubuntu Edgy.
[12:21] <ermak> I installed grub on MBR, after this WinXP  failed to load and I have recovered it, but it has overwritten MBR, how can I start up ubuntu now?
[12:21] <owh> ermak: From the bootcd.
[12:22] <eloquence_> oh
[12:22] <ermak> owh: i have livecd, and what step do i need to perform?
[12:22] <eloquence_> well is there another more efficient program for burning cd's/dvd's including ido's?
[12:22] <ermak> may be usefull link?
[12:22] <eloquence_> something not too big in size that is
[12:22] <owh> ermak: Boot from it, then read the help.
[12:23] <Darst> owh - have you experienced or heard of the sort of reboot problem i am experiencing before ?
[12:23] <owh> eloquence_: You mean iso?
[12:23] <eloquence_> lol yea
[12:23] <eloquence_> me and my fat fingers hahaha
[12:23] <Darst> owh - actually - will wait unti lyou are done with the other guys - got your hands full atm
[12:23] <Kenas> awh after that ?? i have installed unrar-free !! and now ??
[12:23] <Kenas> how can i unrar ??
[12:23] <owh> eloquence_: In Ubuntu you can burn those from within Nautilus, I'd be surprised if you cannot do that under Kubuntu.
[12:23] <Jaak_> is there anyone having problems using opensource ati drivers (used for beryl) and wow?
[12:24] <eloquence_> hmm
[12:24] <eloquence_> nautilus
[12:24] <owh> Kenas: I suspect there isn't a gui, so open up a terminal, then type man unrar.
[12:24] <EdLin> Jaak_: I don't think that works
[12:24] <eloquence_> so i should just install nautilus from adept?
[12:24] <owh> eloquence_: Well, I suspect that Kubuntu will use Konqeror. (SP)
[12:24] <eloquence_> or kde has its equivalent?
[12:24] <Jaak_> EdLine, need normal drivers suppose then?
[12:24] <owh> eloquence_: No.
[12:24] <eloquence_> k
[12:24] <owh> eloquence_: Yup
[12:24] <kippi> hey
[12:25] <EdLin> Jaak_: the closed-source drivers are unfortunately neccesary AFAIK
[12:25] <eloquence_> i had thought that kubuntu was "cooler" than ubuntu cuz of all the little programs it has
[12:25] <kippi> Could someone help me with a coldfusion on my ubuntu server?
[12:25] <eloquence_> but it seems ubuntu is way mor eefficient :(
[12:25] <owh> eloquence_: I suspect that the file manager within Kubuntu will do it. Browse to the iso file, right click on it and see what it says.
[12:25] <Jaak_> EdLin, thanks
[12:25] <EdLin> eloquence_: the most commonly used software in KDE for burning CDs is k3b. It's excellent, but no shell integration as far as I know.
[12:25] <Cubed> sup
[12:25] <eloquence_> u need to heat the cold fusion up kippi?
[12:25] <dstanek> all entries in my sources.lst are for drapper - is it safe to add an entry for edgy?
[12:25] <owh> eloquence_: Well, Kubuntu is based on KDE, Ubuntu is based on Gnome.
[12:25] <Cubed> anyone here wanna help a linux/ubuntu noob
[12:25] <kippi> hehe, need to find the .bin for it
[12:26] <EdLin> I use k3b even though otherwise I run GNOME
[12:26] <huibert> dstanek: no, uise backports to get edgy packages in dapper
[12:26] <huibert> !backports
[12:26] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[12:26] <avalon> Anyone here know about COBOL?
[12:26] <Cubed> i need figure out how to install ndis... heard that before?
[12:26] <owh> dstanek: No, because the side effect will be that you update your whole machine.
[12:26] <owh> dstanek: Do what huibert suggests.
[12:26] <huibert> dstanek: but not all packages are backported
[12:26] <EdLin> Cubed: you can apt-get it, I think its in Universe or Multiverse
[12:26] <owh> Darst: How can I help?
[12:27] <TuxRacers> hello, i've got a problem when  rebooting.. it freezes on "will now reboot"
[12:27] <Cubed> edlin
[12:27] <eloquence_> owh... could the fact that the .iso is on a removable disk have an effect?
[12:27] <cyphase> how do you get a directory tree on the terminal?
[12:27] <Cubed> i read on the forums apt-get is a network feature
[12:27] <owh> eloquence_: Depends on how it's mounted.
[12:27] <avalon> No COBOLer's eh/
[12:27] <EdLin> actually, its in main
[12:27] <Cubed> i'm tring to set up my network
[12:27] <eloquence_> thru usb
[12:27] <eloquence_> its an IDE hard drive
[12:27] <owh> eloquence_: Can you alter the mounted removable disk, or do you only have read-only permissions?
[12:27] <Kenas> owh no manual of unrar found
[12:27] <eloquence_> i can browse it easily
=== Kirrus is now known as Kirrus_
[12:28] <eloquence_> thru konqueror
[12:28] <huibert> avalon: no, sorry, I'm not _that_old :-)
[12:28] <EdLin> avalon: Ubuntu is user-friendly. ;-) Since there is a COBOL compiler in Debian's repositories there's probably one in Universe.
=== Kirrus_ is now known as Aieron
[12:28] <dstanek> thanks huibert and owh - trying this now
[12:28] <owh> Kenas: Type apropos unrar
[12:28] <Cubed> edlin, how do i use apt-get if i don't have an internet connection?
[12:28] <EdLin> Cubed: then you've got a problem.
[12:28] <eloquence_> seems i cant write to it
[12:28] <dstanek> owh: look like the one i want is not
[12:29] <EdLin> Cubed: do you have another computer with a network connection?
[12:29] <eloquence_> that probably why it was saying i have no permissions?
[12:29] <huibert> dstanek: what are you looking for?
[12:29] <owh> eloquence_: Yes.
[12:29] <EdLin> Cubed: never mind, you're here. ;)
[12:29] <dstanek> i want to install libjgoodies-forms-java so i can install freemind
[12:29] <cyphase> nvm, i got it. ls -R
[12:29] <owh> eloquence_: You should be able to change that by right clicking on the device and changing permissions.
[12:29] <Darst> owh: having  probs with X rebooting when trying to play media files - any ideas
[12:29] <EdLin> Cubed: try downloading the debs from packages.ubuntu.com
[12:29] <eloquence_> i noticed that with my ubuntu live cd... i could install a few programs in adept with it taking them from the cd ... like make and gcc and stuff
[12:29] <Cubed> there's gotta be some way to install ndis... i mean think about it, i need ndis to install network drivers :(
[12:29] <ibob63> I am using gnome schedule to run a rsync command. Can anyone tell me how to make the command run as su or sudo?
[12:29] <eloquence_> but kubuntu's adept doesn't seem to have the same relationship with it's cd
=== gord_ is now known as gord
[12:29] <Cubed> how to i install the deb? i tried clicking on it in ubuntu, got an error
[12:30] <EdLin> !ndiswrapper
[12:30] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
=== pietro_ is now known as pierba
[12:30] <owh> Darst: You'll need to have a look in the logs to see what is going on. Start with /var/log/syslog, then look for the X log, in the same directory.
[12:30] <owh> Darst: Also, you can try to play the file from the command line and see what it says.
[12:30] <EdLin> Cubed: you'll need to have it and all its dependencies
[12:30] <dstanek> huibert: libjgoodies-forms-java so i can install freemind
[12:30] <Kenas> owh nothing apropriate
[12:30] <EdLin> Cubed: what was the error?
[12:30] <GigaClon> ibob63 just type sudo, then enter your password
[12:30] <Darst> what sort of cmd will i be using for this from cmdline?
[12:30] <Cubed> you lost me, i'm new to linux outside of the xbox
[12:30] <kyja__> can someone tell me how to get edgy to play middy files
[12:30] <owh> Kenas: One mo....
[12:30] <eloquence_> i tried right click and changing permissions
[12:31] <Cubed> i forget, i've been at it all day
[12:31] <eloquence_> wouldn't let me
[12:31] <Cubed> it was in red...
[12:31] <ibob63> GigaClon: but I need the cron job to run in the back ground without having to type a password each time
[12:31] <huibert> dstanek: I assume it is an Java Library (jar) then , you could try to install that from edgy, but you should only download the dpkg, and try to install with "dpkg -i package_name" , beware thought, it _might_ break your install, I'm not sure if I would do this
[12:31] <owh> Kenas: Can you open it inside the Archive Manager  (Applicaitons -> Accessories)
[12:31] <EdLin> Cubed: dependencies are other files you need to install at the same time as a particular deb. Usually apt-get takes care of this for you, but since you're downloading individual debs you'll need to do that by hand.
[12:32] <eloquence_> oh wait
[12:32] <uczen> FH
[12:32] <treedreamer> eloquence_: try "man chmod" or "man chown" :)
[12:32] <eloquence_> i tried again and its working
[12:32] <uczen> WYPIERDALAC
[12:32] <Cubed> let me get this straight................. if i have the deb package of ndiswrapper, then that should be all i need to install it? the sudo command thingy is funny to me
[12:32] <owh> treedreamer: No, this is an automounted usb drive.
[12:32] <dstanek> huibert: thanks - i'm gonna try to install it into my home directory first
[12:32] <eloquence_> sorry treed... i am addicted to point clicking
[12:32] <uczen> MAI NAME IST DZIK
[12:32] <owh> eloquence_: How big is the .iso?
[12:32] <huibert> dstanek: if that works, it sound slike a good idea, "may the source be with you"
[12:33] <tonyyarusso> !pl | uczen
[12:33] <ubotu> uczen: Mozesz uzyskac pomoc w jezyku polskim na #ubuntu-pl
[12:33] <Kenas> owh No !! even i have installed other programs like Cosmix with uses the unrar ultility... and cannot use it !!
[12:33] <eloquence_> a cd's size
[12:33] <Darst> owh - before i attempt the issue again to track the issues in the logfile - would you mind leting me know what cmd i might use to play a media file from command line ? no doubt i will be rebooting so i will say thanks now and bbiab :)
[12:33] <eloquence_> bout 698mb
[12:33] <eloquence_> its the ubuntu live cd
[12:33] <eloquence_> i wanna burn it
[12:33] <Cubed> i have the ndiswrapper deb, what else do i need?
[12:33] <Cubed> so frusturating
[12:33] <owh> Darst: Depends on what you're running. Totem {mediafile} will play it.
[12:33] <EdLin> Cubed: from what I've been able to figure out with apt-cache there's both the utilities and the kernel module package.
[12:34] <owh> eloquence_: Got enough spare disk space for it?
[12:34] <Darst> owh - thanks prolly dropping out in a moment
[12:34] <EdLin> Cubed: then on one command line, use dpkg -i - or use gdeb
[12:34] <uczen> WHE ARE YOU
[12:34] <eloquence_> yea
[12:34] <Cubed> what will that do?
[12:34] <eloquence_> i see were u r going
[12:34] <eloquence_> just copy it
[12:34] <owh> eloquence_: Alternatively insert the CD, then right click on it, choose copy.
[12:34] <eloquence_> and burn
[12:34] <tonyyarusso> !offtopic | uczen
[12:34] <ubotu> uczen: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[12:34] <owh> eloquence_: Yup
[12:34] <EdLin> Cubed: man dpkg
[12:34] <eloquence_> owh it is an iso on the external hard drive
[12:34] <uczen> ASDASD
[12:34] <Jaak_> is it possible to make 2 bootable versions of ubu, the only diffrence being the xorg.conf
[12:35] <eloquence_> are there tools in linux like daemon tools for mounting images?
[12:35] <EdLin> Cubed: dpkg is sort of like rpm
[12:35] <owh> eloquence_: What options do you get if you right-click on the .iso ?
[12:35] <owh> eloquence_: Many.
[12:35] <glaz> eloquence_, man mount
[12:35] <owh> eloquence_: You shouldn't need to mount it.
[12:35] <Cubed> i've read on rpms, as i wanted ububtu for 3d desktop, but i have never installed anything using the terminal
[12:35] <Cubed> just unsuccessful tries
[12:36] <eloquence_> Open with K3B , Open With... , Actions
[12:36] <EdLin> eloquence_: you can look at any image by mounting with the -o loop command and the proper filesystem (usually iso9660)
[12:36] <owh> eloquence_: I just wondered if you had the actual CD, then you could duplicate it :-)
[12:36] <glaz> Cubed, ubuntu is not a terminal installation
[12:36] <eloquence_> yea
[12:36] <eloquence_> i had it
[12:36] <eloquence_> but gave it to a dude
[12:36] <eloquence_> so i wann aake me a new one
[12:36] <owh> eloquence_: Hah
[12:36] <owh> eloquence_: That 'll learn you :-)
[12:36] <eloquence_> the only reason i came to kubuntu was cuz i screwed my ubuntu up a week ago
[12:36] <Cubed> i said i used the terminal to install some apps
[12:36] <finalbeta> !paste
[12:36] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[12:36] <eloquence_> and decided that if i am gonna reinstall
[12:36] <eloquence_> might as well try kubuntu
[12:37] <EdLin> sudo dpkg -i (file and dependencies here)
[12:38] <owh> eloquence_: I have to say, I have been running my installation for the better part of seven years without a complete re-install. Only last month, I made the decision to format and start with a fresh Ubuntu. Up to then it was a single Debian installation.
[12:38] <Darst> owh - back again... looks like a gfx installation issue...
[12:38] <owh> Darst: So now you can google :-)
[12:38] <eloquence_> wow
[12:38] <Cubed> i'm confusing myself
[12:38] <Darst> owh - can i post the latest couple of lines in a /smg for you to cast a quick eye for me pls?
[12:38] <eloquence_> me being a born and raised windows kiddie ... u can imagine that reinstalling is the easiest option for me
[12:39] <Darst> owg - /msg even
[12:39] <cobol> Anyone in here familiar with the COBOL language?
[12:39] <owh> Darst: Sure, PM/
[12:39] <eloquence_> Darst, in a sub machine gun?
[12:39] <owh> cobol: Sorry, I'm an old timer, but not that old :-)
[12:39] <Cubed> hey edlin
[12:39] <owh> cobol: I cut my teeth on 6502 assembly :-)
[12:39] <eloquence_> cobol... dude did u just wake up out of a coma?
[12:39] <glaz> if you know proper english you know cobol
[12:39] <glaz> :-)
[12:39] <EdLin> cobol: I thought I was ancient for using wordstar on CP/M
[12:39] <eloquence_> i guess so
[12:39] <eloquence_> lol
[12:39] <EdLin> owh: 6502 assembly rocks
[12:40] <eloquence_> he couldnt take the shame
[12:40] <Cubed> i got the 1.3 tar for ndiswrapper, so how do i specicy where it is at?
[12:40] <eloquence_> he just commitied harakiri
[12:40] <eloquence_> poor guy cobol
[12:40] <EdLin> owh: I forgot which was which, indirect index or index indirect.  ;-)
[12:40] <owh> EdLin: ROTFL, NOP
[12:40] <eloquence_> i screwed my ubuntu install up with trying to install the ieee80211 subsystem for my intel ipw3945 wireless driver
[12:40] <eloquence_> so there was no way to recognize a wlan card so i had to reinstall :(
[12:41] <owh> eloquence_: Hmm, that worked for me out of the box.
[12:41] <EdLin> Cubed: you don't want the tar, you want the debs.
[12:41] <Cubed> tar is for... compiling?
[12:41] <eloquence_> on edgy they say it works out the box :(
[12:41] <eloquence_> wireless on dapper was fine
[12:41] <eloquence_> but i wanted the drivers
[12:41] <eloquence_> to be able to do more
[12:41] <eloquence_> or better
[12:41] <EdLin> Cubed: usually, and you can't compile kernel modules on a Ubuntu system that has nothing instsalled from the net.
[12:41] <gnomefreak> Cubed: a tar is a compressed archive
[12:41] <eloquence_> when it comes to recognizing and interacting on wireless
[12:41] <owh> Cubed: tar is an archive, it generally contains source code. You should normally prefer to do everything via apt-get, aptitude or synaptic.
[12:42] <eloquence_> my main prob was i didn't know i have to install the kernal source and headers
[12:42] <EdLin> owh: he doesn't have an internet connection apparently.
[12:42] <eloquence_> so during th einstall it asked me to delete the old ieee80211 (v1.1.6)
[12:42] <owh> Cubed: The whole point of using packages is that you can remove the whole thing without creating dependency issues.
[12:42] <Cubed> so.... do i use synaptic to install the deb of whatever i need?
[12:42] <eloquence_> then it tried to install the new one and found no headers or source so automatically ... NO wlan card :(
[12:42] <Cubed> yeah thanx owh, but i have no internet connection
[12:43] <Cubed> i'm literally switching hard drives by hand
[12:43] <owh> Cubed: Where are you getting your stuff from?
[12:43] <eloquence_> i live in saudi arabia right now... so it is an issue that i can only use dial up from home
[12:43] <Cubed> not good, but necessary
[12:43] <eloquence_> i go to a local cafe to use their broadband
[12:43] <eloquence_> bah humbug on dial-up
[12:43] <eloquence_> we need rudolf the rednosed crackhead to drop off some bandwidth
[12:43] <Cubed> i'm at hom
[12:43] <Cubed> home
[12:44] <Cubed> i have the internet, but i must configure my wireless to work in ubuntu... i'm currently on windows
[12:44] <EdLin> eloquence_: use "sudo pppconfig" to set up dial-up networking for Ubuntu, then you can install whatever you need.
[12:44] <owh> Cubed: So, lemmie get this straight, you have a Ubuntu install and you're trying to do what?
[12:44] <owh> Cubed: Ah.
[12:44] <owh> Cubed: So, your only connectivity is wireless?
[12:44] <Cubed> yep
[12:44] <Cubed> at the moment
[12:44] <eloquence_> cant use my modem
[12:44] <eloquence_> winmodem
[12:44] <owh> Cubed: On what wireless device?
[12:45] <Cubed> i have a netgear ma111 wireless adapter via usb
[12:45] <EdLin> eloquence_: I got a new external modem for $30US
[12:45] <solem> im trying to do a apt-get update, but i get this error: Failed to fetch http://no.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy-updates/main/source/Sources.bz2  MD5Sum mismatch
[12:45] <solem> why is that?
[12:45] <eloquence_> so i use my other laptop that is on windows then connect it thru ethernet to my wireless router
[12:45] <EdLin> now *I'm* on wireless
[12:45] <eloquence_> and that broadcasts dial up to my lappie on linux
[12:45] <owh> Cubed: Then the ndiswappers from memory are not for you. Lemmie check.
[12:45] <EdLin> but before, dial-up worked
[12:46] <Cubed> i have ndiswrapper debs...... what is the best way to install debs?
[12:46] <owh> Cubed: dpkg -i {deb}
[12:46] <EdLin> Cubed: owd seems to think you don't need ndiswrapper
[12:46] <eloquence_> find me a linux compatible modem in saudi arabia and i'll give u a cookie
[12:46] <Cubed> oh that's what ed tried to tell me
[12:46] <owh> One mo folks.
[12:46] <eloquence_> they have some here but from no name companies from china
[12:46] <huibert> solem: sound like the repos is broken atm, try again later. should not be more than a day.
[12:46] <eloquence_> and dial up is not the point anyways
[12:46] <solem> ok :)
[12:46] <eloquence_> i needed wireless for the broadband at cafes
[12:47] <EdLin> Cubed: if you can avoid ndiswrapper avoid it.
[12:47] <eloquence_> i hate staying online forever clogging my phone line up
[12:47] <eloquence_> slow download busy signal for whoever calls me and a big phone bill at the end of the day
[12:47] <owh> Cubed: Which version of Ubuntu are you running?
[12:47] <eloquence_> we pay $.80 per hour here
[12:47] <Cubed> what would you reccomend for my ma111?
[12:47] <Cubed> 6.10
[12:47] <Cubed> i heard it works
[12:47] <eloquence_> it adds up when u r apgetting a big file
[12:47] <Cubed> just a biatch to get it goin
[12:47] <huibert> solem: the repos was updated today at 11:15 (1,5 hours ago) maybe something went wrong
[12:48] <solem> ah ok :)
[12:48] <huibert> huibert: if you are in a hurry, try to switch away from the NO mirror, and use the ubuntu.com repos
[12:48] <miles> Hi there
[12:48] <owh> Cubed: Read this: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/32275
[12:48] <EdLin> huibert: talking to yourself? ;-)
[12:48] <Cubed> what is an alternative to ndiswrapper? i wanted ndiswrapper badly because i heard it is capable of handling my wireless card
[12:49] <EdLin> Cubed: an alternative is the Linux kernel's own device drivers....
[12:49] <miles> I'm desesperately looking for help, I'd like to copy/paste some text from a PDF document generated by CUPS-PDF to OOo, but evince does not allow me to copy it.
[12:49] <owh> Cubed: Also: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2781.html
[12:49] <miles> It's pretty urgent
[12:49] <huibert> EdLin: trying to talk to solem, but it does not allway work, tab completion only works correct if I use the correct fisrt characters
[12:49] <EdLin> Cubed: if your device is supported, it can be a no-install issue.
[12:49] <JackPhil> does ubuntu support non-standard framebuffer resolutions?
[12:49] <JackPhil> such as 1280x800
[12:50] <owh> Cubed: It appears as if ndiswrapper is the way after all. I hadn't seen an external device that needed it, only internal. I was wrong.
[12:50] <Weryk> Witam
[12:50] <Cubed> edlin, i think i need a 3rd party for my ma111
[12:50] <Weryk> o you speak Polish ??
[12:50] <ajeetraj> anyone knows where i can find support for webcams in ubuntu?
[12:51] <ajeetraj> anyone knows where i can find support for webcams in ubuntu?
[12:51] <apokryphos> !webcam
[12:51] <ubotu> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[12:51] <EdLin> Cubed: owd says now you need ndiswrapper. Did you fetch all the dependencies? Go to the directory they're in and do sudo dpkg -i *.deb
[12:52] <Cubed> i'm trying to piece things together..... ok... i need dependencies for each deb i install?
[12:52] <ajeetraj> i can't recieve webcam from an msn user in kopete but it doesn't work
[12:52] <Cubed> and if i have dependencies, i wouldn't know where they would be at :P
[12:52] <ajeetraj> any suggestions anyone?
[12:52] <ajeetraj> aaah i am getting tired of this linux :(
[12:53] <EdLin> Cubed: you don't install debs with dependencies one by one, install them all at once on the command line by using the wildcard *.deb
[12:53] <DreamThief> your webcam works with camorama? @ ajeetraj
[12:53] <huibert> !patience > ajeetraj
=== kevin is now known as SeyToN
[12:53] <Cubed> owd, thanx for the links
[12:53] <Cubed> i'm reading and typing
[12:54] <EdLin> searching ubuntuforums can be very useful. :)
[12:54] <Cubed> wildcard? there's more stuff i don't know?
[12:54] <Cubed> trust me, i have done a search
[12:54] <miles> (2) I'm desesperately looking for help, I'd like to copy/paste some text from a PDF document generated by CUPS-PDF to OOo, but evince does not allow me to copy it.
[12:54] <Cubed> a bunch of em
[12:54] <Cubed> just can't filter out what i need and what is BS
[12:55] <tomix> anyone give me and idea of how to upgrade from xvncviewer the server i am connecting to uses protocol version 3.889 but my viewer use 3.3?
[12:56] <owh> miles: If you cannot, then it's likely that the PDF document is an image, not text.
[12:57] <miles> with vector fonts ?
[12:57] <miles> Whatever the zoom size I use, I can't see any pixels on the "text"
[12:58] <huibert> tomix: have you read this " http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2006-September/055902.html ", it about a non existant protocol 3.889
[12:58] <huibert> tomix: sounds like the server behaving badly.
[12:59] <tomix> yeah i think the osx is reporting an error number as version number
[01:01] <huibert> tomix: then, it is no use trying to install a "higher" vncview
[01:01] <huibert> version
[01:02] <tomix> no absloutely but you only just pointed the url out to me that told me that
[01:02] <tomix> i didnt know when i asked
[01:03] <huibert> tomix: that's why you were asking in the fisrt place :-)

[01:20] <assasukasse> glaz noone else can write it
[01:20] <glaz> assasukasse, what about ~/.config/autostart
[01:20] <tw1991> what does this mean "The model number for your Radeon card is a 9700 pro or above (this includes model numbers that start with an X, like X300, X1600, etc., and it also includes the Xpress 200)"
[01:21] <assasukasse> glaz read and write to me, read and execute to others
[01:21] <dyland> yes
[01:21] <glaz> it should be chmod 700
[01:21] <assasukasse> but dir owned by root
[01:21] <glaz> there you you
[01:21] <tw1991> ?
[01:21] <assasukasse> glaz what should i do then
[01:21] <fabio__|> i installed a new video card and xorg doesn't start anymore, can someone tell me the command to auto reconfigure it? thanks.
[01:21] <glaz> assasukasse, sudo chown "yourusername" /home/yourusername/.config/autostart
[01:22] <x-r00t-x> tw1991, shut up and install ubuntu . its will work .
[01:22] <glaz> dont put the ""
[01:22] <tw1991> ...
[01:22] <romperstomper> sry guys was afk
[01:22] <romperstomper> so anyone with dual monitor ati exp?
[01:22] <hc> assasukasse : use chmod 777 and then the file or directory
[01:22] <tw1991> so it will auto work?
[01:22] <glaz> hc, hell no.
[01:22] <Alexandre> Hello guys, there is something like F4L, flash for linux in ubuntu?!?!?!
[01:22] <tw1991> i need to ask, because i am new to it..
[01:22] <soundray> x-r00t-x: this is not the way we talk to people seeking help here.
[01:22] <soundray> !coc | x-r00t-x
[01:22] <ubotu> x-r00t-x: The Ubuntu Code of Conduct to which we ask all Ubuntu users to adhere can be found at http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct/
[01:22] <hc> why
[01:22] <abcdef> hi everyone.. can anyone tell me if here's a way to minimize evolution into the systray??
[01:23] <derFlo> hi
[01:23] <glaz> assasukasse, dont listen to hc please.
[01:23] <assasukasse> glaz i followed your hint now i am rebooting
[01:23] <x-r00t-x> huh soundray ?
[01:23] <derFlo> i deleted all files in ~/.wine/ ..and i dont know how to reconfigure wine :(
[01:23] <tw1991> I need this "When you are unsure, ask for help."
[01:23] <tw1991> lol:)
[01:23] <fabio__|> i installed a new video card and xorg doesn't start anymore, can someone tell me the command to auto reconfigure it? thanks. I suppose it is a apt-get command..
[01:23] <glaz> why? why would you want your whole users puting startup scripts to your session.....
[01:23] <assasukasse> glaz everything works now thanks alot!
[01:23] <fabio__|> derFlo: type winecfg
[01:23] <glaz> assasukasse, you're welcome.
[01:23] <hc> wots wrong with 777 glaz?
[01:23] <derFlo> fabbione: i did
[01:23] <derFlo> try this not only once
[01:24] <hc> everyone can acces the file then
[01:24] <glaz> hc: what is wrong is that any other users can put startup script to your Xorg session after that, do you really want that ?
[01:24] <fabio__|> i installed a new video card and xorg doesn't start anymore, can someone tell me the command to auto reconfigure it? thanks. I suppose it is a apt-get command.. :(
[01:24] <soundray> tw1991: if you download the Desktop CD appropriate for your machine, you can test if it will boot without installing.
[01:24] <glaz> and chmod to 700 isnt the propper way to fix something that shoulndt be 777
[01:24] <Alexandre> There is a program flash in Ubuntu?!?!?!??
[01:25] <fabio__|> alexandre: you mean a program to edit .fla or to view .swf?
[01:25] <jishin> i got into problem with mkcfm when trying to defoma-reconfigure
[01:25] <x-r00t-x> sup jrib  :D
[01:25] <glaz> Alexandre, what do you mean a program, view or create flash?
[01:25] <Alexandre> fabio__|: Edit, create
[01:25] <jishin> Can't exec "/usr/bin/mkcfm": No such file or directory at /var/lib/defoma/scripts/x-ttcidfont-conf.defoma line 791.
[01:25] <fabio__|> alexandre: with wine on edgy eft, i can easily run macromedia flash professional 8
[01:26] <jrib> x-r00t-x: hello
[01:26] <jishin> i knew that because of license , mkcfm is not included with xutils, so how can i resolve this situation
[01:26] <Alexandre> fabio__|: glaz, i use Dapper
[01:26] <x-r00t-x> hi . how are you ;))
[01:26] <tw1991> Quote: " tw1991: if you download the Desktop CD appropriate for your machine, you can test if it will boot without installing." means if im downloading 6.10 desktop i can boot it without installing?
[01:27] <fabio__|> alexandre: so try to installa manually the latest version of wine. with the new version of wine that i have on edgy eft, Flash Professional 8 works very well.
[01:27] <assasukasse> thanks glaz everything works now!
[01:27] <fabio__|> i installed a new video card and xorg doesn't start anymore, can someone tell me the command to auto reconfigure it? thanks!!
[01:27] <glaz> assasukasse, you're welcome.
[01:27] <x-r00t-x> yes tw1991
[01:27] <soundray> tw1991: exactly. It is a so-called Live CD that boots a full Linux system without touching your hard disk until you ask it to.
[01:27] <assasukasse> is there anyone who tried beryl here, i tried it but was not so satisfied of the speed, compiz is much swifter
[01:27] <tw1991> ok, so i will need to burn it out as a cd :)
[01:27] <glaz> assasukasse, i run beryl and i find it fast.
[01:28] <tw1991> i think i got it, thanks alot.
[01:28] <soundray> tw1991: yes
[01:28] <tw1991> try it first, before install :)
[01:28] <Alexandre> fabio__|: i'm in ca comunity computer center, working with ltsp, if i do this, everybody, will download windows program
[01:29] <glaz> fabio__|, X -configure might work
[01:29] <stojance> How do I open applications that use JavaScript and require WMP to play, and also use .../mplayer
[01:29] <gundee> assasukasse, everything fine with beryl. since beryl is forked from compiz, thus being the core components the same, speed should not differ (much)
[01:30] <assasukasse> gundee why so many ppl say compiz is far better
[01:30] <Doow> is there any package for integrating subversion with eclipse in ubuntu? or do I have to download and add that manually?
[01:30] <hc> how so i send a message over my network from linux to a mac, similar to netsend command
[01:30] <gundee> assasukasse, ida know, ppl are biased
[01:30] <fabio__|> doow: the name is "subclipse"
[01:31] <Doow> fabio__|: sweet, thanks
[01:31] <fabio__|> Doow: it is a eclipse pluging, search "subclipse" on google.
[01:31] <Doow> fabio__|: ok, so manually then?
[01:31] <tundejeg> hi
[01:32] <gundee> assasukasse, ... but don't mind trying out both versions and posting the framerates. that would clarify.
[01:32] <fabio__|> Doow: go in the install/update secion of Eclipse and enter there the URL of the subclipse repository
[01:32] <Doow> fabio__|: eclipse has it's own package system?
[01:33] <Basthion> hola
[01:33] <Doow> fabio__|: just installed it 5 minutes ago, not very familiar with it yet =)
[01:33] <pibarnas> hello, folks.
[01:33] <fabio__|> Doow: yes, eclipse has it's own package management system

[01:34] <derFlo> i deleted all files in ~/.wine/ ..and i dont know how to reconfigure wine :(
[01:35] <pibarnas> mouse gestures on  beryl 0.1.2 stop working without any configuration. Any ideas to enable it again?
[01:35] <fabio__|> derFlo: run winecfg
[01:35] <fabio__|> please can someone tell me the apt command to completely reconfigure xserver? thanks.
[01:35] <derFlo> fabio__|: i did.. but wine gives out errors.
[01:36] <derFlo> fabio__|: look at that:

[01:36] <Doow> fabio__|: I think it's apt-get install --reconfigure <package>

=== _enabl is now known as enabl
[01:44] <Randakar> derFlo: there's a wineconf program for that I think

[01:45] <Randakar> derFlo: wine should recreate that itself I guess.

[02:01] <vendetta> Manstein: i think it should be poss through aticonfig, but its just not outputting to the second monitor
[02:01] <glaz> A3n, append your user with a coma before on the admin line of /etc/groups

I used to have firefox32 (i386 downloaded from official site and other install from the unofficial deb found on the forums) on edgy, but now on feisty firefox32 works and loads the plugins but doesn't connect to any sites! Could anybody plz help me with that?
[02:02] <frying_fish> glaz: oh ok, well then.
[02:03] <huibert> A3n: but to use Admin tools in ubuntu you need to be able to use gksu (graphical sudo), so you might be in a catch 22 situation
[02:03] <hhyyjj163> who can help me?
[02:03] <frying_fish> huibert: not true.
[02:03] <A3n> huibert:i'll just edit manualy :p
[02:03] <enfors> Postfix/imap question: Is there really no easier way of getting imap to work than setting up courier, and _manually_ setting up tables and stuff in a mysql database?
[02:03] <vendetta> Manstein: is there a better place to try? ati specific or laptop maybe???
[02:03] <A3n> huibert:what do i need to change add to it? want me to paste bin its content?
[02:03] <huibert> frying_fish: why not true?
[02:03] <frying_fish> if you have a terminal available (or an xterm of some kind) you can just prepend sudo to the command to run the application
[02:04] <hhyyjj163> i want share internet use iptable,but idont kown how to do?
[02:04] <frying_fish> it doesn't have to be launched from the menu and use gksu.
[02:04] <Manstein> Vendetta: will check in -xgl channel, tnx
[02:04] <Valmarko> When visualizing web page, the words are very small, compared to Windows. Can you help me?
[02:04] <A3n> huibert:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35770/ my etc/group
[02:04] <huibert> frying_fish: but if you cannot do a sudo, because  your not in the admin group, you cannot use both
[02:04] <hhyyjj163> help!
[02:04] <frying_fish> but your statement of needing the gksu was the part that was not true
[02:05] <enfors> Postfix/imap question: Is there really no easier way of getting imap to work than setting up courier, and _manually_ setting up tables and stuff in a mysql database?
[02:05] <mahdi> seems like the downloaded firefox doesnt connect to any sites (with and without linux32)... what could b wrong?
[02:05] <VigoFusion> mahdi: You have internet connection working, my guess is a setting in the /cofig? of that Firfox
[02:05] <frying_fish> well, if you can get to the root account, you can still launch it from the terminal anyway.
[02:05] <huibert> frying_fish: if one clicks on "system->admin->BLAH BLAH" gksu is invoked in ubuntu
[02:05] <mahdi> VigoFusion: yep. If i run x86_64 firefox from ubuntu repos with works fine
[02:05] <abuyazan> hello , can some one help in PowerDNS installtion
[02:06] <frying_fish> yes, but. if you launch a xterm (or other terminal emulator) you can become root with su, then just type the command that would launch it. i.e. for synaptic just type synaptic.
[02:06] <hhyyjj163> anyone kown iptables?
[02:06] <frying_fish> (and hit enter of course)
[02:06] <frying_fish> hhyyjj163: google has some very good guides for iptables.
[02:06] <huibert> A3n: you are in the admin group, you should allready be able to use the administrativ tools.......
[02:06] <huibert> What was your problem again.
[02:06] <A3n> huibert: apperantly i'm in the admin group (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35770/) but i cant use sudo, gksu . not even if i su [password]  myself to root
[02:07] <mahdi> VigoFusion: and don't think it is about firefox.cfg because i copied the file from the working version and it still doesn't work
[02:07] <needhelp> whats a command to tell which ubuntu version is running?
[02:07] <soundray> needhelp: cat /etc/lsb-release
[02:07] <gnomefreak> needhelp: lsb_release -a
[02:07] <needhelp> thnx
[02:07] <noika> hey guys anyone knows how do i install yahoo messenger?
[02:07] <huibert> A3n: su will not work, because ubuntu creates a random (unknown) password for root at intall time
[02:07] <gnomefreak> mines shorter ;)
[02:07] <hhyyjj163> i have try some,but fail;  fish
[02:07] <mwe> should most extarnal usb dvd burners be working in Ubuntu?
[02:07] <gnomefreak> huibert: use sudo
[02:08] <VigoFusion> mahdi: I am newb to Debian/Linux, but that seems like a common program error of no comm or is a missing link in some config that permits Firefox to access.
[02:08] <huibert> gnomefreak: I know, I'm talking to A3n..... :-)
[02:08] <gnomefreak> oh
[02:08] <soundray> huibert: it doesn't create a random password
[02:08] <A3n> huibert: i use su all the time to set myself root and be able to use the commands i would need  "sudo" to do
[02:08] <frying_fish> huibert: does it do it that way? I didn't think it created anything, it just had the account disabled.
[02:08] <huibert> soundray: what password does root have on your machine?
[02:08] <frying_fish> huibert: like he's going to tell you.
[02:08] <VigoFusion> mahdi: Did you run the sys file checker?
[02:08] <huibert> soundray: ehhh, don't tell me
[02:08] <brynk> frying_fish: it doesn't :)
[02:09] <A3n> huibert: i set my own root password with "passwd root"
[02:09] <mwe> or should I expect problems unless I buy a particular dvd burner?
[02:09] <soundray> huibert: there is no root password, and the root account is locked
[02:09] <frying_fish> yeah I set my own root password as well.
[02:09] <mahdi> VigoFusion: yep. The weird thing is that it used to work fine... the feisty upgrade must have broken it
[02:09] <hhyyjj163> i want share internet use iptable,but idont kown how to do?
[02:09] <soundray> huibert: that's one of the main advantages of using sudo instead of logging in as root.
[02:09] <huibert> frying_fish: ok,
[02:09] <mahdi> VigoFusion: how do i do that?
[02:09] <A3n> huibert:i got told that i have somekind of thing i need to change in my /etc/hosts but nobody ever told what i needed to change
[02:10] <huibert> A3n: I think the discusion got a bit sidetracked
[02:10] <VigoFusion> mahdi: Revert, is an option at Boot, or use the backup that I hope you made...
[02:10] <mahdi> VigoFusion: ah, yep. I used it but has nothing to do
[02:10] <A3n> whenever i try to use sudo or gksu i get error "gethostbyname() not found" or something like that
[02:11] <huibert> at anybody: how do I get ubotu to tell me something in private (without flooding the chanel)?
[02:11] <soundray> A3n: of course I told you. You need to remove the last part of the first line, anything that's not 127.0.0.1 or localhost
[02:11] <hhyyjj163> anyone kown iptables?
[02:11] <mahdi> VigoFusion: and i don't intend to use the backup. Feisty seems to have fixed more stuff than it broke =P
[02:11] <A3n> soundray: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35771/ is my hosts file
[02:11] <huibert> soundray: sound good
[02:11] <tc75> hi, how can i print pdfs from command line?
[02:11] <soundray> A3n: in order to be able to edit /etc/hosts, you need to boot in recovery mode and run 'nano /etc/hosts'
[02:12] <VigoFusion> mahdi: I have no idea what the command/sudo is for sys file check, but I saw it on the Debian Site, and a few Linux sites.
[02:12] <mista> ok how can i bridge my two nic's?
[02:12] <A3n> ah ok
[02:12] <soundray> A3n: yes, I've seen that. Remove 'ordiadri'
[02:12] <Manstein> or nano -w /etc/hosts
[02:12] <frying_fish> soundray: not if he has a root account available like I think he said he has.
[02:12] <A3n> my computer name?
[02:13] <soundray> A3n: "ordiadri" must not be linked to 127.0.0.1
[02:13] <A3n> soundray: k
[02:13] <soundray> A3n: you can link it to your LAN address
[02:13] <brynk> soundray: A3n: you don't need toreboot to edit /ets/hosts
[02:13] <mahdi> VigoFusion: i don't think it is about it anyway... the command is fsck. I only checks for integrity and the system is fine. It's a matter of some firefox settings
[02:13] <mahdi> VigoFusion: just don't know where to look yet
[02:14] <soundray> brynk: you haven't followed the entire conversation

[02:15] <VigoFusion> mahdi: I may have it bkmarked, am looking now
[02:15] <soundray> brynk: he can't use sudo, so he'll need recovery mode
[02:15] <soundray> A3n: sorry, I just made an assumption about your gender there.
[02:16] <A3n> soundray: huh?
[02:16] <soundray> A3n: let's fix the sudo issue first, then attack the LAN configuration
[02:16] <soundray> A3n: I said 'he' (referrring to you) as I was just talking to brynk
[02:16] <A3n> soundray: well i am a "he" lol

[02:17] <Ubuntu> hi all
[02:17] <A3n> soundray: ow another thing, i have downloaded a tool wich allows me to read/write to my linux partition wich i named drive Z:
[02:18] <A3n> soundray:cant i edit from windows?
[02:18] <mahdi> ubuntu's firefox seems to detect wether the system is 64 or 32bits... any chance that firefox64 will use 32bits plugins if ran with linux32?
[02:18] <sod75> hi!
[02:18] <mahdi> VigoFusion: :) tkz
[02:18] <soundray> A3n: yes, that should be possible
[02:18] <soundray> A3n: if Z: corresponds to your root dir where /etc/hosts is located
[02:18] <Valmarko> How can I change the width and hight og a web page. Firefox?
[02:18] <mjr> mahdi, there's nspluginwrapper for running 32-bit plugins in a 64-bit browser, but I don't think it's readily packaged and don't know about stability
[02:19] <mwe> hey, anyone know if I should expect problems in linux mounting an external usb dvd drive? should I buy a particular drive?
[02:19] <soundray> mahdi: no
[02:19] <A3n> so i removed "ordiadri" next to "localhost " now what do i add to it?
[02:20] <soundray> A3n: nothing for now
[02:20] <mahdi> mjr and soundray, tkz... by any chance do u know what could b wrong when 32bits firefox2 downloaded from the official site doesnt connect to any sites? 64 bits firefox runs fine though
[02:20] <soundray> mahdi: no... have you tried installing the firefox package by Kilz?
[02:20] <mahdi> soundray: yep. Same issue
[02:21] <A3n> soundray:it looks like this : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35773/ now

[02:22] <A3n> soundray: after "nano /etc/hosts" ?

[02:22] <A3n> soundray: so no recovery mode right?

[02:22] <damageDOn1> Does anyone know how to move mail from evolution on one machine to another evolution on another machine?
[02:23] <A3n> k
[02:23] <soundray> A3n: yes, that's right. Recovery mode would have been for editing /etc/hosts, which you have already done.
[02:23] <Trini_Man> copy the .evoloution
[02:23] <Trini_Man> in your home dir
[02:23] <inam> hi all... im getting "i/o error - error reading boot cd" when i try to run live cd of ubuntu edgy. i tried burning the cd in a friends drive and also burning it at 4x. still doesnt work. same error. can someone help? thanks :)
[02:24] <damageDOn1> trini_man: I tried to tar the .evolution folder and it turned out empty
[02:24] <Trini_Man> humm
[02:24] <soundray> damageDOn1: what tar command did you use?
[02:24] <Trini_Man> i did that many times and it worked fr me
[02:24] <mista> ok i have to nic in one machine i want another to run thought my two nic machine to my ISC wht should i be looking up?
[02:24] <kleftisx> hello how can i play WMV movies on ubuntu?
[02:25] <edubezval> Hello all, I'm facing a problem with the linux-image-2.6.17-10-386 package. I was using dapper, and updated to edgy... but now, every time I use apt/dpkg, it claims about this package. It can't find a correct tool to generate the initrd image. Does somebody already faced this problem?
[02:25] <damageDOn1> trini_man: I can try copying the folder without compression

[02:25] <Trini_Man> yeah i
[02:25] <random`entity> inam: i used to be getting that for every computer i try for a few months.. before 6.10 came out. yesterday i tried again with the latest version, and it worked fine.
[02:25] <random`entity> ok. hello. anyone familiar with xdm around?
[02:25] <soundray> damageDOn1: only copy $HOME/.evolution/mail -- otherwise you'll be copying the calendar, addressbook... everything
[02:25] <Trini_Man> use VLC to play windoes media files
[02:26] <inam> random`entity: you mean i should download a new iso file and try ? btw, the md5 checks out fine
[02:26] <soundray> inam: have you used *any* boot CD successfully with this drive?
[02:26] <random`entity> inam: nope, the file is not corrupted. i re-downloaded several times too. you might want to try a different version.
[02:27] <soundray> inam: it could just be a dirty laser lens
[02:27] <random`entity> anyway..
[02:27] <random`entity> i'm trying to get background images in xdm.
[02:27] <Trini_Man> thats odd i never had trouble copying my evoloution mail
[02:27] <random`entity> have been working on it for a few hours with no success.
[02:27] <damageDOn1> soundray: whoops I just started copying everything... oh well
[02:27] <random`entity> any recommendation?
[02:28] <Manstein> Anybody : patch -p1 < wine-wow-fixes.patch doesn't patch, it forces me to choose between 2 files
[02:28] <Manstein> and then fails to patch them :S
[02:28] <VigoFusion> kleftisxc: you can get an 'ugly plug' or a friendly one from Synaptic Package Manager that works in Totem
[02:28] <damageDOn1> Does the same thing work with firefox for bookmarks?
[02:28] <inam> soundray, do you mean "created boot cd" or "booted using boot cd"... this is the first time i am creating one, but ive booted several times dapper CD
[02:28] <random`entity> i use shell command in Xsetup and Xsession file to run qiv -z (draw to root window and quit)
[02:28] <Trini_Man> damageDOn1 : yes
[02:28] <random`entity> it simply doesn't show up.
[02:28] <damageDOn1> I knew I was on the right track!
[02:28] <hhyyjj163> anyone kown iptables?i want share internet use iptable,but i dont kown how to do?
[02:29] <Trini_Man> damageDOn1 : are u sure u are copying it correctly ?
[02:29] <rconan> can anyone help fixing an error 17 from grub?

[02:30] <hhyyjj163> VigoFusion: thank you very much!
[02:31] <VigoFusion> :)
[02:31] <Trini_Man> WOW i now check and i have like 27 updates this morning
[02:31] <damageDOn1> trini_man: the problem seemed to be the tar'ing. I should have just copied them straight.
[02:31] <Trini_Man> damageDOn1 : ok kool
[02:32] <noika> guys what can i do to fix this eror...i get it when i try to install knights  (chess game)error processing zope-replacesupport (--configure)
[02:32] <mwe> so, are most external dvd writers supported in Ubuntu?

[02:34] <kleinlappies> help pls i need a vob to avi or mpeg converter. is there anyway i can do it?
[02:34] <random`entity> other commands in the same file execute, though.. e.g. 'xsetroot -solid' works
[02:35] <Ubuntu> dpkg: impossible to open in read the files with info about the package `/var/lib/dpkg/available': No such file or directory
[02:35] <frandavid100> hi. I want to file a bug against the open, save, etc dialogs. what package would that be?
[02:35] <soundray> random`entity: did you pass a full path and filename as argument to -bitmap?
[02:35] <mwe> it's hard to find out on google if linux has good support for extarnal dvd writers or not
=== thefish_ is now known as thefish
[02:36] <random`entity> soundray: yep. xsetroot -bitmap '/usr/share/xfce4/backdrops/blah-blah.png'
=== Ubuntu is now known as Parmaster
[02:37] <kleinlappies> is there a vob2avi converter for linux?
[02:37] <soundray> mwe: if you're buying one just for reading, any one should be okay. If you're buying a (re)writer, the chances of success are still high.

[02:38] <soundray> mwe: to be on the safe side, buy from a store that gives you a no-questions-asked exchange warranty for a few days
[02:38] <kleftisx> why i can not modify the resources.list?
[02:38] <soundray> mwe: I would think so
[02:38] <b_52Free> /etc/init.d/cupsys  = ?
[02:39] <soundray> kleftisx: 'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'
[02:39] <mwe> soundray: I'll make sure it can be exchanged if it doesn't work, though. thanks
[02:39] <b_52Free> man cupsys don't give anything
[02:39] <soundray> b_52Free: is that a question?
[02:39] <frying_fish> b_52Free: are you trying to start or stop cups?
[02:40] <b_52Free> soundray,  more than an interrogation :d
[02:40] <b_52Free> frying_fish,  yeap
[02:40] <b_52Free> restart it
[02:40] <frying_fish> ok, put restart at the end of the line

[02:40] <Hattori> Does anybody know if i can make Photoshop run under Breezy with wine?
[02:41] <Parmaster> guys i've a problem with installing application on ubuntu, someone can help me?
[02:41] <Jeeva> use gimp
[02:41] <b_52Free> soundray,  ah thanks i didn't know that cups have a differend name under ubuntu
[02:41] <FJM> hi, i have a problem with libnss-ldap, anybody can help me??
[02:41] <FJM> or its a bug???
[02:41] <soundray> b_52Free: it doesn't
[02:41] <Hattori> I use Gimp olso but... some things are missing from Gimp.,,
[02:42] <b_52Free> soundray,  ah ok just the process is named differently
[02:42] <linux1> hiya ppl can someone help me my prelink is broken im getting this error message "prelink.bin: ../../src/stabs.c:100: adjust_stabs: Assertion `dso->shdr[n] .sh_entsize == 12' failed."
[02:42] <damageDOn1> trini_man: I got the evolution one working but the firefox one hasn't worked.
[02:44] <Hattori> damageDOn1: Do you installed all the packages for FF?
[02:44] <damageDOn1> "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window you must first close the existing Firefox process or restart your system."
[02:44] <damageDOn1> How do I kill the process?
[02:45] <abhay> Hello everyone
[02:45] <Jeeva> kill -9 pid
[02:45] <MarcN> damageDOn1: ps auwx|grep firefox  (or killall firefox-bin)
[02:45] <Terminus> damageDOn1: kilall -9 firefox-bin
[02:45] <soundray> damageDOn1: if you've tried to transfer a .mozilla directory, it isn't really running.
[02:45] <w3ccv> damageDOn1, killall firefox-bin
[02:45] <Terminus> killall i mean.
[02:45] <abhay> Is there any graphical bandwidth monitor available for GNOME?
[02:46] <damageDOn1> Wow thanks everyone... but your all saying different things
[02:46] <soundray> damageDOn1: it's best to run the old firefox installation, export the bookmarks, and import them into the new ones.
[02:46] <abhay> something like knemo for KDE http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=12956
[02:46] <puk_jp> abhay try gkrellm
[02:46] <soundray> damageDOn1: then redo all the settings -- they aren't worth trying to transfer old-to-new.
[02:46] <abhay> puk_jp: i want something that can be docked in system tray
[02:47] <rconan> can anyone help me with a grub error 17 after installing ubuntu?
[02:47] <rconan> i tried reinstalling grub but doesnt help
[02:47] <frying_fish> abhay: the system monitor has an applet that can do network traffic
[02:47] <soundray> abhay: try the system monitor applet. It can be configured to show network usage
[02:48] <damageDOn1> soundray: I copied across home/old_home/.mozilla/firefox/blahblah.default into home/new_home/.mozilla/firefox/
[02:48] <Hattori> rconan: I had it olso... It turned out to be from incorect partitioning...
[02:48] <netman> hi, somebody with this problem after update to edgy:  first attempt to login on gdm fails
[02:48] <abhay> thanks i will just check it out :-)
[02:48] <strappisUbuntu> ciao a tutti
[02:49] <rconan> Hattori: what was incorrect about it?
[02:49] <damageDOn1> soundray: I tried using killall -9 firefox-bin and I'm still getting the same message
[02:49] <soundray> damageDOn1: I would recommend you to 'rm -rf /home/new_home/.mozilla/firefox' and to set up a fresh firefox configuration.
[02:49] <soundray> damageDOn1: it happens because it's confused by that old config directory
[02:49] <abhay> will system monitor keep statistics for the data transfer as well? like daily, weekly, monthly etc?
[02:49] <omar> how can I know the vertion of my nfs
[02:50] <Hattori> rconan: Some damage to partition, after format... I suspect that program from begining of installation...
[02:50] <dthacker> I'm working with a team on a free project that's unlikely to make the deadline for Debian Etch.  Does Ubuntu accept apps that are not part of the last Debian release?
[02:50] <soundray> damageDOn1: it takes ages to sort out, longer than you need to reconfigure.
[02:50] <edubezval> hey guys, does somebody know how to fix the "Failed to find suitable ramdisk generation tool" problem?
[02:50] <dbe> WWhat does Ubunutu use instead of apt-setup to select location for respositories?
[02:50] <thefish> abhay: if you want data transfer stats, install ntop
[02:50] <hyakuhei> dthacker: of course it does
[02:50] <AndreNoel> anyone knows who admins the @ubuntu.com mails?
[02:50] <hyakuhei> dthacker: #ubuntu-motu
[02:50] <random`entity> hmph.. xsetroot keeps giving me 'bad bitmap format file'...
[02:50] <dbe> Anyone?
[02:50] <Hattori> rconan: Try format with Partition Magic first...
[02:50] <abhay> thefish: i have heard that ntop is very CPU intensive. Is that true?
[02:51] <dthacker> hyakuhei: thanks!
[02:51] <thefish> abhay: i have not found that no, and it gives VERY detailed stats about transfers
[02:51] <damageDOn1> soundray: I did rm the old ??????.default folder
[02:51] <rconan> Hattori: partition magic requires money
[02:51] <damageDOn1> But it's still confused
[02:51] <dthacker> abhay: it will may show up among your top processes, but it's not going to bog your cpu
[02:52] <thefish> abhay: may be overkill for you if you just want to know that you have downloaded X Mb
[02:52] <abhay> oh thats great...then i will install that :)
[02:52] <abhay> thefish: oh
[02:52] <abhay> so is there any small applet like thing available?
[02:53] <Hattori> rconan: I know... but something like it i don't really know righ now... I mean professional.
[02:53] <soundray> rconan: Partition Magic is a *waste* of money
[02:53] <abhay> I just want how much I downloaded in a month to keep under my bandwidth limit
[02:53] <rconan> soundray: i totally agree
[02:53] <Hattori> soundray: Why you say that?
[02:53] <soundray> rconan: how did you get into this error 17 situation?
[02:53] <rconan> it happened when i first reboot after install
[02:54] <soundray> Hattori: because parted is a better program that is free and libre
[02:54] <soundray> rconan: you said that reinstalling grub didn't help -- how did you do the reinstall?
[02:55] <Hattori> soundray: I agree, but somethimes make errors like that one...
[02:55] <fromvega> Hello
[02:55] <ShereKhan> Hello
[02:55] <soundray> Hattori: PM sometimes wastes entire hard disks
[02:55] <rconan> soundray:
[02:55] <rconan> grub
[02:55] <rconan> root (hd0,1)
[02:55] <rconan> setup (hd0)
[02:55] <soundray> Magic indeed
[02:55] <rconan> could the problem be to do with having a separate boot partition?
[02:56] <soundray> rconan: do you know the device name of your separate boot partition?
[02:56] <Eclypse> does edgy boot up faster then dapper?
[02:56] <soundray> Eclypse: a little bit
[02:56] <rconan> soundray: (hd0,1) or /dev/hda2
[02:57] <Eclypse> soundray I hear it uses upstart now, which is what OSX uses, and OSX boots in around 10 seconds.
[02:57] <soundray> rconan: is there a directory grub in there, boot/grub or both?
[02:57] <soundray> Eclypse: I don't believe upstart is what OSX uses, and my OSX takes much longer to boot than edgy
[02:58] <Eclypse> soundray really? lol ok, then it must be much faster then dapper
[02:58] <Eclypse> soundray I hate waiting 40 seconds for it to boot, its really irritating
[02:58] <Eclypse> soundray and I have a pretty fast laptop, too
[02:58] <soundray> Eclypse: i.e. longer than 10 seconds, more like a minute (OSX on PPC Mac mini)
[02:59] <fromvega> I configuring a proxy for a network. Which is better, to use the adsl modem as router or to use the same machine that is running the proxy as router?
[02:59] <Eclypse> soundray, I ran it on my laptop
[02:59] <Eclypse> soundray and it booted in 10 seconds
[02:59] <fromvega> s/I/I'm
[02:59] <A[D] minS> is there GUI to configure grub ?
[02:59] <rconan> soundray: yes there is a grub directory in there and there is a symlink called boot to .
[02:59] <dcordes> does anybody know a good guide on howto setup a dyndns client?
[02:59] <random`entity> ok. gave up. i can live with a solid background ):

[03:02] <soundray> rconan: can you run an e2fsck on hda2 from a live CD or so?
[03:03] <JaXxon> thanx Eclypse
[03:03] <rconan> soundray: i just did and it made no errors
[03:03] <rconan> soundray: even forcing the test
[03:03] <soundray> rconan: it's very weird. Error 17 means it doesn't recognize the filesystem on the partition
[03:03] <rconan> i know
[03:04] <Randakar> umgan: EE?

[03:04] <rconan> soundray: does grub require the boot flag to be on any particular partition?

[03:04] <hilbert94> Hello! How can I find out what version of Ubuntu I'm using?
[03:04] <Randakar> SniZ: got that one?
[03:04] <SniZ> Randakar, i try this
[03:04] <soundray> rconan: perhaps you should try to sideline your boot partition for now and copy the file contents into the reiser /boot/, then reconfigure grub with (hd0,0) or whatever your root partition is.
[03:05] <aiduciukas> Tomcat_, yes I know that it SHOULD but it isn't
[03:05] <Tomcat_> hilbert94: lsb_release in terminal
[03:05] <SniZ> Randakar, but i cant startx
[03:05] <soundray> rconan: no, grub completely ignores boot flags
[03:05] <rconan> soundray: the root is /dev/hda7 which doesnt have a grub device does it?
[03:05] <Randakar> umgan: so 'mount /dev/hdX /partition' doesn't work?
[03:05] <omar> Hi guys, I need some help , I am tryingt to mount a folder between debians but i get this error "mount: RPC: Authentication error; why = Failed (unspecified error)"

[03:05] <emanuele11> HI everybody! i have a problem: my *ubuntu edgy, every time I use a multimedia program, it chrashes "Arts Error: cpu overload , aborting." What should I do?
[03:06] <hilbert94> Tomcat_: Thank you very much.
[03:06] <soundray> rconan: of course it does: (hd0,6) (confirm with 'geometry (hd0)'
[03:06] <soundray> )
[03:06] <umgan> randakar: not sure honestly ive only tried right clicking it and choosing mount (it says its not a removable drive)
[03:06] <aiduciukas> Tomcat_, any other ideas?
[03:06] <hilbert94> I didn't know this before. In debian I just know /etc/debian_version
[03:06] <rconan> soundray: i thought grub couldnt handle extended partitions
[03:06] <Tomcat_> aiduciukas: Not really... I've never seen such an error.

[03:07] <glaz> my numeric keypad isnt working even on numlock, any idea?
[03:07] <soundray> rconan: quite fortunately, you thought wrong ;)
[03:07] <Randakar> umgan: I'm afraid you'll have to start a terminal and try doing it from there first
[03:07] <aiduciukas> Tomcat_, it allways worked but suddenly it don't wanna to work
[03:07] <Tomcat_> hilbert94: You can also use "About Ubuntu" in the menus
[03:07] <soundray> rconan: I only ever install Linux to extended partitions these days...
=== QM is now known as QwertyM
[03:08] <umgan> randakar: sure 1 sec i'll give it a shot
[03:08] <soundray> rconan: there /may/ be situations where grub has difficulty accessing partitions beyond a certain offset from the "beginning" of the disk space, but this is becoming rare.
[03:08] <Randakar> SniZ: EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!
[03:09] <rconan> soundray: its an old machine
[03:09] <rconan> could it be that?
[03:09] <Randakar> SniZ: Sounds like you need to install the linux-restricted-modules package
[03:09] <emanuele11> so...
[03:09] <soundray> rconan: I don't think so, but use the geometry command to see if it reports anything
[03:10] <SniZ> Randakar, wait. i try
[03:10] <soundray> rconan: and do try the move of your current boot to the root partition -- there's no risk involved (beyond the obvious stupid mistakes that we all make from time to time)
[03:10] <random`entity> ok, stupidity on my part; didn't know i need to update initramfs :P
[03:10] <random`entity> thxs a lot, ttyl

[03:11] <SniZ> Randakar, if i use i686 kernel, it cant load modules for i386?

[03:12] <goose> what's the word on the new xserver updates for edgy?
[03:12] <goose> any problems?

[03:13] <jackbear> Good Morning what is the antivirus of preference for Ubuntu?
[03:13] <soundray> sergevn: you still need good amounts of RAM -- I've 192MB on that machine and it runs well enough
[03:13] <soundray> !virus | jackbear
[03:13] <ubotu> jackbear: A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21

[03:13] <goose> linux1: thanks
[03:13] <sergevn> soundray, ok i think that is my problem then, i only have 64meg of ram
[03:14] <soundray> sergevn: can you get your hands on some extra RAM? Shouldn't be too expensive these days...
[03:14] <linux1> sergevn there an alternate cd from the ubuntu site for pc with under 192mb ram
[03:14] <umgan> randakar: thanks so much that did the trick...however i dont have permissions to write to the drive anymore
[03:15] <Randakar> umgan: you'll need to add the partition to your /etc/fstab file
[03:15] <sergevn> soundray, yep. I already ordered them on my work ( i work in a local hardware store) got 2 rigs of 256mb of ram for like 60 euro
[03:15] <Randakar> umgan: then possibly add some options to it

[03:15] <J4kch> Hey guys, I just downloaded an .iso. How do I mount it?
[03:16] <umgan> randakar: i had a friend help me with this once before...he used the terminal to open a gui window as the root and i changed the permissions easily from there
[03:16] <soundray> sergevn: the alternate install CD won't be of any use to you
[03:16] <dthacker> soundray: is the alternate install CD only for Unbuntu, and not for Kunbuntu/Xbuntu?
[03:16] <sergevn> soundray, ah yes. what window manager does that alternate cd have?
[03:16] <Randakar> umgan: you can try running 'gksudo nautilus' I suppose
[03:16] <emanuele11> J4kch:  sudo mount -o loop xxx.iso /where/you/want
[03:17] <Randakar> umgan: but that command you ran (mount) isn't permanent, it will go away again when you reboot
[03:17] <JackPhil> i changed /etc/usplash.conf
[03:17] <J4kch> emanuele11: Thanks a bunch!
[03:17] <soundray> sergevn: it's for installing the non-graphical way -- it still provides a full gnome install with metacity by default
[03:17] <JackPhil> should i do something else to make it effect?
[03:17] <sergevn> ah ok
[03:18] <umgan> randakar: ahh ok...so to make it permanent i need to add it to fstab?
[03:18] <Randakar> umgan: so adding a line to /etc/fstab is recommended in any case.
[03:18] <Randakar> umgan: Yes. That file is pretty straightforward.
[03:18] <sergevn> soundray, i need the desktop environment, because it's on my laptop ( IBM Thinkpad 390x), doing light office work on it.
[03:18] <sergevn> soundray, only CLI wont do
[03:18] <linux1> sergevn you could use that cd then install xbuntu de afterwards
[03:19] <soundray> sergevn: (dthacker, linux1) I take it all back -- there is an alternate Xubuntu install CD that works on machines with 64MB (http://www.xubuntu.org/get)
[03:19] <umgan> randakar i'll give it a try 1 sec

[03:19] <emanuele11> bye!
[03:19] <ndlovu> is there any application in ubuntu that I can use to view multiple page tiff files?
[03:20] <Randakar> umgan: but most of the options come directly from the manual page for mount: 'man mount'
[03:20] <soundray> sergevn: "alternate" install means that only the installer is nongraphical. It still installs Gnome, Xfce or KDE, respectively
[03:20] <ndlovu> I have a virtual fax service that sends me faxes in tiff format. the only application I've been able to use so far is the gimp, and that requires a lot of effort!
[03:21] <J4kch> How do I un-mount the iso now?

[03:22] <J4kch> Randakar: Thanks
[03:22] <sergevn> soundray, *would not
[03:22] <Randakar> J4kch: sorry, 'umount'
[03:22] <soundray> sergevn: oh, so you did manage to install Xubuntu? I misread your first question then.
[03:23] <J4kch> Randakar: Alright, cool
[03:23] <sergevn> soundray, yes :D, im running it now atm. but with crappy memory :P
[03:23] <soundray> sergevn: well, the 256MB you're getting will remove that bottleneck.
[03:23] <sergevn> soundray, 2x256 :D
[03:24] <soundray> sergevn: all the better ;)
[03:24] <umgan> randakar: before i formatted the drive i was able to view it as ntfs...the info for that drive is still in fstab...i mounted it to the same point so all i shoudl need to change would be the file system type?
[03:25] <sergevn> soundray, well im off, thanks for the help :)

[03:29] <SniZ> Randakar, i install all modules

[03:29] <umgan> randakar: sigh it says /dev/hda1 is not in the fstab lol
[03:29] <Randakar> SniZ: The error you're getting suggests the install you did didn't work somehow
[03:30] <Randakar> umgan: what if you type 'grep /dev/hda1 /etc/fstab' - do you get output?

[03:32] <basti> i was disconnected... thatswhy i cant read
[03:32] <soundray> basti: try 'sudo apt-get install build-essential', then 'make' again (und wo bitte ist Koetschlitz ;)
[03:33] <Kawaii-Panda> i installed the nvidia card package and now i need to know what it is called, nv, nvidia, how can i list them all?
[03:33] <basti> Nhe Leipzig ;)
[03:33] <SniZ> Randakar, i try "aptitude install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10", but not found this
[03:33] <rconan> soundray: i get error 18 with that partition
[03:33] <Randakar> Kawaii-Panda: aptitude search xserver-xorg | grep -e '^i A'
[03:33] <umgan> randakar: yeah thats all i got
[03:33] <rconan> i think my boot partition must cross the boundary of what my bios can read
[03:34] <Randakar> Kawaii-Panda: nv is the xorg builtin driver, 'nvidia' i the binary package one
[03:34] <rconan> looks like a have to reinstall with a small boot partition on (hd0,0)
[03:34] <soundray> rconan: "Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS" -- dang, you ran into the problem that I told you was rare...
[03:34] <Randakar> umgan: ok, that line is a comment

[03:35] <KenSentMe> Does anyone know if i can get a list of the cli commands i used in the last week or longer?
[03:35] <Randakar> umgan: the line directly below it is where that partition was originally mounted. It should start with 'UUID='
[03:35] <rconan> soundray: if i put a small  boot partition on (hd0,0) that should work should it not
[03:35] <soundray> basti: it's a metapackage that installs some headers for compiling stuff
[03:35] <basti> kk
[03:35] <basti> ah ok, thanks
[03:35] <basti> englisch freak ^^
[03:35] <soundray> rconan: yes
[03:35] <umgan> randakar: right thats the line where i changed the file system from ntfs to ext3
[03:35] <Randakar> umgan: if you look at the output at 'ls -ld /dev/disk/by-uuid/*' you'll get a list of all drives and the corresponding UUID values
[03:35] <soundray> rconan: but then your /dev/hda2 *should* have worked, too...
[03:36] <soundray> rconan: maybe there is a deeper misunderstanding between grub and your BIOS

[03:36] <basti> i upload em

[03:36] <umgan> randakar: oh hmm that drive isnt showing up

[03:37] <basti> soundray: http://www.phpfi.com/182305

[03:38] <will__> soundray: sarcasm granted

[03:39] <QwertyM> will__, why? I like it :D You can try irssi for terminal though, there is also a ircii around. Plus GAIM and Kopete support IRC too

[03:40] <will__> yeah I know
[03:40] <will__> it's just that it's not easy to configure the GUI for it

[03:42] <mandawar> ^^
[03:43] <soundray> mandawar: let's say you need libncurses5. The runtime library is called just that, the developer library is libncurses5-dev

[03:46] <sam1982> Someone please help me, im trying to install a file i downloaded and i dont know how, ive asked the chinese rooms and they are the most unhelpful people i have ever met and even one of them wants me to give him money
[03:46] <sam1982> money
[03:46] <sam1982> i dont know what to do ...
[03:46] <umgan> randakar: it made a log file i'm going to read it
=== treelikeswow is now known as LookTJ
[03:46] <soundray> mandawar: just wondering why you aren't responding any more.
[03:46] <mandawar> i try to get all the dependencies for the compilation ^^
[03:47] <umgan> randakar: the log just says that it us unable to resolve the UUID
[03:47] <soundray> mandawar: was I making sense about the -dev packages and the native ubuntu version?
[03:47] <soundray> mandawar: why compile when you can install it from the repositories?
[03:47] <mandawar> because cant be, that only ncurse is missing, because the compiler doesnt know even simple ... befehle ^^
[03:47] <soundray> mandawar: why compile when you can install it from the repositories?
[03:47] <mandawar> i cant get pftp from repos
[03:47] <sam1982> Someone please help me, im trying to install a file i downloaded and i dont know how, ive asked the chinese rooms and they are the most unhelpful people i have ever met and even one of them wants me to give him money
[03:48] <Randakar> umgan: hm, not really sure where it stores the UUID or where it generates it, for that matter
[03:48] <mandawar> because its a special version i got... On FC4 i was able 2 compile
[03:48] <erUSUL> sam1982: what are you trying to install
[03:48] <erUSUL> ?
[03:48] <Randakar> umgan: like I said, simply replacing UUID=blah with /dev/hda1 should do the trick for the short term though
[03:48] <soundray> mandawar: how about 'apt-get build-dep pftp' then?
[03:48] <sam1982> erUSUL Luma
[03:49] <sam1982> its a chinese software   but the idea is the same as Gaim.
[03:49] <lesshaste> is there some way of increasing the mic volume level? Both audacity and skype record things at an almost inaudible level
[03:49] <SupremacyGnu> Hey, I'm having problem to run Frostwire and Azureus. Both are java applications so I was thinking there might be a problem with my java. Reinstalled java, still it won't start. Thanks
[03:49] <Ash-Fox> Yes
[03:49] <sam1982> erUSUL i have a tar file on my desktop but i cant get it to install..
[03:49] <mandawar> hmm... cannot get this idea if i dont know the... befehl ^^
[03:49] <erUSUL> sam1982: what type of file you dled?
[03:50] <Randakar> SupremacyGnu: tried running azureus from a terminal?
[03:50] <sam1982> lumaqq_2006M2-linux_gtk2_x86_no_jre.tar.gz  <  this type
[03:50] <erUSUL> sam1982: open a terminal and go to ~/Desktop/
[03:50] <Ash-Fox> lesshaste, I believe theres that 20db+ microphone boost option you can enable.
[03:50] <mandawar> WHOHOOOO!!!
[03:50] <soundray> SupremacyGnu: they tend to rely on /bin/sh being linked to /bin/bash (edgy default is /bin/dash)
[03:50] <mandawar> It works with the ncurse libs :)
[03:50] <Ash-Fox> lesshaste, unfortunately I don't remember how todo that in Gnome, I know how todo it with kmix though (KDE application)
[03:50] <sam1982> ok
[03:50] <SupremacyGnu> tobbe@dammburk:~$ azureus
[03:50] <SupremacyGnu> exec: 40: java: not found
[03:50] <SupremacyGnu> tobbe@dammburk:~$ frostwire
[03:50] <SupremacyGnu> runFrost.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[03:50] <SupremacyGnu> tobbe@dammburk:~$
[03:50] <umgan> randakar: ok i'll do that
[03:51] <lesshaste> Ash-Fox, I have kmix but don't see this option
[03:51] <will__> ah ha :)
[03:51] <erUSUL> SupremacyGnu: if you want sh to link to bash do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash'
[03:51] <will__> much much better :>
[03:51] <will__> QwertyM, thanks very much bud :)
[03:51] <will__> mmm
[03:51] <will__> having probs getting WoW to update
[03:51] <QwertyM> will__, np
[03:51] <QwertyM> World of Wow ? :p
[03:52] <will__> I can log in fine, but once the updater starts running, it ain't downloading anything :E
[03:52] <will__> yes indeed
[03:52] <Ash-Fox> lesshaste, okay, open kmix -> switches -> microphone boost
[03:52] <umgan> randakar: once thats done i remount the drive?
[03:52] <sam1982> erUSUL  what do i do next dude?  do you know ?
[03:52] <SupremacyGnu> erUSUL, sorry, don't get it. I'm a beginner linux user.
[03:52] <Ash-Fox> !wow
[03:52] <ubotu> Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[03:53] <soundray> SupremacyGnu: run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash' in a terminal and answer No to the question
[03:53] <umgan> randakar: what woudl be there command for that? mount /dev/hda1 /media/storage ?
[03:53] <erUSUL> sam1982: tar xf yourfile.tar.gz
[03:53] <Randakar> umgan: just run 'mount -a' and it should happen automatically
[03:53] <Randakar> umgan: mount -a mounts everything in /etc/fstab
[03:54] <sam1982> erUSUL whats tat
[03:54] <Randakar> will__: I just updated it in windows, then run from the same partition - in linux ;-)
[03:54] <SupremacyGnu> soundray, ok, still don't work. Hm, seems as if it won't detect my java at all. Because when I type 'java' nothing happends, trying to install it again with easyubuntu
[03:54] <erUSUL> sam1982: a comand do 'tar xf lumaqq_2006M2-linux_gtk2_x86_no_jre.tar.gz'
[03:55] <umgan> randakar gotcha...well that said wrong fs type bad option etc.....is this what my new uuid line should look like? /dev/hda1 /media/hda1     ext3    defaults,tnls=uf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1
[03:55] <soundray> SupremacyGnu: hold on
[03:55] <soundray> SupremacyGnu: test the frostwire first. It should work now.
[03:55] <Randakar> umgan: remove that tnls option .. I doubt that works in ext3
[03:55] <Randakar> umgan: NTFS specific 'codepage' selection
[03:56] <SupremacyGnu> soundray, ah yes! seems to work actually... loading
[03:56] <sam1982> where do i type that erUSUL?  i mean i have no idea how to do this !
[03:56] <screechingcat> looks like Edgy just recieved a shit load f updates. including the extremely fragile xorg. anyone done the upgrades ? any breakages ?
[03:56] <mandawar> Thanks a lot soundray !!! Got it working :)

[03:56] <ubotu> sam1982: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[03:56] <lesshaste> Ash-Fox, no such option...
[03:56] <soundray> mandawar: well done, und Gre
[03:56] <lesshaste> Ash-Fox, I have "channel mode" and three "input source" buttons
[03:56] <unimatrix9> hello all
[03:57] <umgan> randakar that gave me no error but the drive still isnt showing
[03:57] <Randakar> umgan: what does it say when you type 'mount' ?
[03:57] <soundray> SupremacyGnu: to fix your java, leave Easyubuntu aside for now and run 'sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre'
[03:57] <sam1982> ?
[03:57] <unimatrix9> i been strugling with monitor settings , the option to set 75 to 60 hz is not there, how could i change that?
[03:58] <lesshaste> anyone know what the "capture" columns are in alsamixer>
[03:58] <SupremacyGnu> soundray, ok
[03:58] <umgan> randakar: a whole lot but at the bottom i see /dev/hda1 on /media/hda1 type ext3 (rw)
[03:58] <lesshaste> I have 3 of them for some reason
[03:58] <SupremacyGnu> soundray, ok. done
[03:59] <Randakar> umgan: so if you do a 'cd /media/hda1; ls' you'd see the contents of your new partition
[03:59] <unimatrix9> so refreshrate has only one option 75 hZ, i would like to be able also to set it to 60 Hz, any tips?
[03:59] <SupremacyGnu> soundray, hm, azureus starts but crash just after it's started
[03:59] <Randakar> umgan: you won't have a desktop icon for it though, if that's your issue
[03:59] <bilss_> hi
[03:59] <Ash-Fox> lesshaste, I guess your soundcard doesn't support it...
[03:59] <screechingcat> unimatrix9: change the refresh rate in system>prefs>screen res
[04:00] <umgan> randakar: yeah i see my files there. and correct there is no desktop icon
[04:00] <Randakar> umgan: Should be a simple matter of creating one then :-)
[04:00] <unimatrix9> thats the point, there is no optoin there to change it, only 75 Hz shows up there
[04:00] <kybuz> hiya all
[04:00] <kybuz> i have a script i use for newspost with newspost i upload my files 2 newsgroups. the thing is i have 2 execute the script from the directory in which the files are which i want 2 upload.....but in the script itself i want 2 built an extra option in it that the script asks me which directory or file a i want 2 upload ....is that possible  and so yes can anybody help me out ???
[04:00] <kybuz> <kybuz> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35486/
[04:00] <screechingcat> unimatrix9: <im blank>
[04:00] <bilss_> i am trying to see if i have had any mail from someone but since i get thousands of mails a day is there something with the "tail" i can use ie tail  balbal /var/mail
[04:00] <lesshaste> Ash-Fox, turning up "capture" fixed it. I have no idea why nor why there are three capture settings
[04:00] <umgan> randakar: lol like i said i started messing w/ linux like yesterday so i'm not entirely sure how to go about that
[04:00] <s0nix> hi
[04:01] <s0nix> anyone can told me how change the sound card used by ALSA driver ^
[04:01] <erUSUL> sam1982: go here and learn a little about comand line interface https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[04:01] <will__> umgan, it ain't something you can pick up in a couple of hours
[04:01] <Randakar> umgan: hard to tell you without actually showing you where to click in nautilus, don't have a gnome desktop in front of me either so I'm likely to be wrong if I try to do that from memory ;-) )
[04:01] <will__> follow erUSUL 's advice
[04:01] <will__> go read a little bit
[04:01] <SupremacyGnu> soundray, please take a look here. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35781/ Thanks for helping me by the way
[04:01] <will__> learn the basics
[04:02] <umgan> randakar ok no problem i' can get my friend to help me w/ it when he gets home i think...one other thing tho
[04:02] <Randakar> umgan: but either a right-click on your desktop or some sniffing around in the 'places' menu will probably get you there
[04:02] <umgan> randakar: i accidentally created an "untitles folder" in the computer:/// how the heck do i get rid of it?
[04:03] <cmt^^> Hello Randakar
[04:03] <cmt^^> Everything is working now! :>
[04:03] <Randakar> umgan: if you have an 'untitles folder' if you type 'cd /; ls' then you can just type 'rm -r untitles\ folder' but I'd be carefull with that
[04:03] <burner_> anyone notice the massive amounts of updates to edgy today?
[04:04] <QwertyM> burner_, I just got a evince update :s
[04:04] <umgan> randakar ok thanks
[04:04] <QwertyM> lemme check
[04:04] <burner_> a lot of kde and the gimp was updated
[04:05] <QwertyM> nah, no updates waiting for me, maybe of apps specially?
[04:05] <soundray> SupremacyGnu: sorry, I don't have a solution for that
[04:05] <QwertyM> GIMP, I remmeber doin one a week ago!
[04:05] <screechingcat> burner_: yeah huge updates
[04:05] <QwertyM> I dunt have KDE :)
[04:05] <SupremacyGnu> soundray, ok. Checked the web and it seems as if I can fix it if I download the latest version. Thanks for the help
[04:05] <belfegorash> hi all
[04:05] <burner_> screechingcat: know if it's security related?  according to update-manager, only one was a security... I'm just curious what the issue was
[04:06] <soundray> SupremacyGnu: good luck
[04:06] <Randakar> burner_: no idea bout edgy, but feisty landed 200Mb of updates yesterday evening
[04:06] <screechingcat> burner_: a guy over at #ubuntu-offtopic just did the updates. he reports that everything went fine. so go ahead and upgrade
[04:07] <burner_> screechingcat: thanks... whenever X updates, I get a little leary ;)
[04:07] <unimatrix9> i installed edgy yesterday, there are only 13 mb updates
[04:07] <screechingcat> burner_: yeah me too. thats why i asked at offtopic first
[04:07] <burner_> unimatrix9: you prolly don't have the backports repo
[04:07] <Randakar> burner_: well, if it's any comfort, my feisty update left me with a broken nvidia driver and a new kernel that wouldn't boot in the beginning ;-)
[04:07] <Randakar> burner_: :P
[04:08] <swanfl> I just noticed the major changes to edgy :)
[04:08] <burner_> the 2.17 release of gnome doesn't seem too compelling yet either... but I'm sure that will change after a few releases
[04:08] <the_mug> is anyone else experiencing intermittent "Couldn't load icon for Open Folder" errors when running: network-admin ??
[04:09] <the_mug> ^^ on Edgy
[04:09] <burner_> the_mug: change your icon theme?
[04:09] <belfegorash> this program is just like mirc?
[04:09] <quiet> can anyone tell me how I would go about setting a custom icon to be permanently used by a removable usb drive?
[04:09] <bilss_>  i am trying to see if i have had any mail from someone but since i get thousands of mails a day is there something with the "tail" i can use ie tail  balbal /var/mail
[04:09] <burner_> belfegorash: this is IRC which are the same type of protocol used in mIRC... yes
[04:10] <the_mug> burner_: I'll try that. :-) is Feisty 7.04 ?
[04:10] <belfegorash> thank you
[04:10] <burner_> feisty is 7.04
[04:10] <the_mug> aha.
[04:10] <engla> Truly, development feature-wise seems to slow down radically in gnome. Not that I complain now that gedit is great and the desktop uses less memory than ever
[04:12] <screechingcat> no reason to upgrade to feisty. all the updates today were feisty backports. i was subscribed to the feisty-changes list (breifly, before my inbox got flooded) and all these changes were announced yesterday
[04:12] <the_mug> bur[n] er: no dice on changing the Theme. :-/ any other ideas?
[04:12] <screechingcat> so if we're getting updated backports, i'd rather stick with the stable release
[04:12] <bur[n] er> the_mug: sure... use NetworkManager instead...   "sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome"
[04:13] <the_mug> bur[n] er: should I reboot or restart X after I change the Theme?
=== igor is now known as igcek
[04:13] <bur[n] er> screechingcat: there's an rss feed for feisty changes :)  http://media.ubuntu-nl.org/rss/feisty.xml
[04:14] <bur[n] er> the_mug: nope
[04:14] <sc0tt> hm
[04:14] <dustin> hello
[04:14] <sc0tt> anyone have any tips for creating screencasts?
[04:14] <jishin> how do i input asian character into KDE-apps in Gnome
[04:14] <VigoFuse_> Greetings
[04:14] <dustin> can anybody help a noob with linux can anybody help me out with some basic commands and such
[04:14] <screechingcat> bur[n] er: cool. i had 85 mails in 2 minutes yesterday from feisty-changes
[04:15] <screechingcat> jishin: i think its something to do with SCIM
[04:15] <MarcN> sc0tt: I've looked at recordmydesktop (includes sound recording) but it isn't in the ubuntu repos.  Google it
[04:15] <the_mug> bur[n] er: I'm fine with having different text files for different locations... this GUI crap... 'ALWAYS' craps out on me in one way or another... :-/
[04:15] <will__> dustin www.linuxcommands.com
[04:15] <dustin> thank you
[04:15] <sc0tt> alright MarcN :)
[04:15] <bur[n] er> sc0tt: it's all over planets as of lately... i just use byzanz which saves to animated .gif
[04:15] <the_mug> bur[n] er: home.interfaces ... work.interfaces ... etc.
[04:15] <screechingcat> sc0tt: ive heard a lott about a prog called istanbul
[04:15] <VigoFuse_> Would 2 installs of different versions conflict?
[04:15] <sc0tt> screechingcat: I've checked that out and its not too great
[04:16] <screechingcat> VigoFuse_: what program ?
[04:16] <bur[n] er> the_mug: have you seriously tried network-manager?  it's great and set to be included in Gnome 2.18.  http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/
[04:16] <verbose> is it bad to run fsck -y /dev/hda1 if hda1 is ext3 instead of ext2?
[04:16] <jishin> i searched for the link that show how to input Asian chars in qt- apps like Kile ..., but it's not working
[04:16] <VigoFuse_> Edgy and Fiesty?
[04:16] <verbose> will it destroy the journal?
[04:16] <jishin> http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-27811.html
[04:17] <the_mug> bur[n] er: I'll give it a whirl. :-) thanks
[04:17] <Citek> Can someone please help? I'm interested in adding more "workspace" boxes in the bottom right hand corner, It is my first day on any Linux Dis.
[04:17] <bur[n] er> sc0tt: if you dont' care too much about GPL... this is free and works to save to .swf  http://www.debugmode.com/wink/

[04:18] <sc0tt> bur[n] er
[04:18] <sc0tt> :] 
[04:18] <screechingcat> VigoFuse_: you can do 2 seperate installs of edgy and fesity on the same hard disk and everything will be fine. but feisty is NOT recommended for end-users.
[04:18] <VigoFuse_> Citek: I am not on my Ubuntu, but I think just right click,add workspace
[04:18] <IdleOne> Citek: 4 workspaces arent enough?
[04:18] <Citek> sc0tt: Right click what?
[04:18] <Citek> Idleone: I only have 2!
[04:18] <IdleOne> Citek:  right click on the workspace
[04:19] <VigoFuse_> screenchingcat: Was going to test it on 2 HDs, one box.
[04:19] <belfegorash> i am a beginner..pls answer:D..where are the partitions..i am using ubuntu
[04:19] <Citek> Idleone: Scott: Thank you alot! For anyone else wondering - Right Click Workspace > Prefrencess
[04:19] <sc0tt> you're welcome
[04:19] <IdleOne> no problem
[04:19] <cassed> hi guys total linux noob here... can anyone help me, im trying to get mame to work on my box and ive run into a wall
[04:19] <screechingcat> VigoFuse_: it wont conflict. but fesity is likley to break very often. use it just for testing and bug reporting
[04:19] <sc0tt> i'd suggest running into a pillow, rather than a wall :P
[04:20] <the_mug> bur[n] er: what is the package name for network-admin so I can uninstall it?
[04:20] <VigoFuse_> Sounds like FUN! :-)
[04:20] <cassed> msg me if u think u can help
[04:20] <Citek> IdleOne: Do you know anything about WINE?
[04:20] <VigoFuse_> !wine
[04:20] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[04:20] <the_mug> bur[n] er: I tried dpkg -l | grep network-admin but it returned nothing
[04:20] <cassed> anyone?
[04:20] <IdleOne> cassed:  describe your problem in here and perhaps someone can help you and anybody else who may be reading:)
[04:20] <cassed> !mame
[04:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mame - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:20] <IdleOne> Citek:  nope not alot
[04:21] <Guychi> Hi. I just installed Ubuntu 6.06. I am surprised that I can't find Django in the package manager. Am I looking in the wrong place, or what?
[04:21] <IdleOne> !repos
[04:21] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[04:21] <cassed> Well... i used synaps package manager to install x-mame and i used the add/remove programs thing to install kxmame and now i dont know what to do... kxmame isnt working... the directorys where x-mame should be located according to kxmame dont exist :(
[04:22] <IdleOne> Guychi: read what ubotu  just said
[04:22] <cassed> Synaptic package manager**
[04:23] <VigoFuse_> cassed: Have you looked in the terminal to see if any packages still reside . and maybe a --purge would help if it is needed?
[04:23] <cassed> man... total noob i know 3 commands in terminal sudo apt-get install sudo aptitiude search and sudo aptitude install
[04:24] <Citek> Anyone: When I go to "Applications > Add/Remove" are all those programs to install up to date everyday? Or can I make them that way if not?
[04:24] <belfegorash> ok pls tell me where is should search my partition...i have 12 mg free on desktop but...
[04:24] <screechingcat> Citek: whenever there are upgrades available, an orange buttone will show up in the top bar
[04:25] <Citek> screechingcat: Thank you sir!
[04:25] <cassed> has anyone here installed and got kxmame to work?
[04:25] <screechingcat> Citek: May the force be with you
[04:25] <will__> guys, quick question about WINE
[04:26] <will__> it obviously installed and running ok
[04:26] <DjViper> help! I crashed X when I installed nvidia driver, how do I fix it?
[04:26] <IdleOne> it tastes good!
[04:26] <will__> infact, nm, its time I was out of here
[04:26] <will__> bbl :D
[04:26] <cassed> anyone here installed and got xmame to work?
[04:27] <trappist> cassed: yes, but it complains about all my roms
[04:27] <cassed> trappist did you use kxmame as the interface for xmame?
[04:28] <trappist> cassed: no, I didn't know it existed until you mentioned it a minute ago
[04:28] <JJAUA> what's the best way to share files in a dualboot system with XP and Ubuntu? Use FAT16, FAT32 or Ext2?
[04:28] <trappist> JJAUA: fat32
[04:28] <cassed> trappist how did u run xmame if not with a frontend?
[04:28] <VigoFuse__> K, lemee get on Ubuntu and see if the error of updates for me is fixed...back in a bit
[04:29] <JJAUA> trappist... why's that? Ext is not fully accesible in windows with ext2fds?
[04:29] <trappist> cassed: with command line options
[04:29] <cassed> trappist, you are leet
[04:29] <derFlo> is there any program for copying music onto my sony walkman mp3 player? it uses a database, so i cannot just copy in nautilus
[04:29] <cassed> too leet for me infact
[04:30] <trappist> JJAUA: it's been a long time since I tried to access an ext2 fs from windows, but when I did it destroyed the filesystem.  there are probably better solutions now.
[04:30] <djmccormick> hey guys
[04:30] <Randakar> I'd love for windows to get ext3 support, it'd make my life so much easier ;-)
[04:30] <djmccormick> how can i set up a static ip on my ubuntu 6.06 LTS command-line only box
[04:30] <belfegorash> with this program i can acces normal channel in the old mirc? or are differit?
[04:30] <cassed> Windows > Ubuntu?
[04:30] <cassed> *puts on flame proof suit*
[04:30] <swanfl> Randakar, isn't there a driver for Windows to "see" an ext3 partition?
[04:31] <apokryphos> cassed: #ubuntu-offtopic for general chat
[04:31] <derFlo> swanfl: you can use comercial software
[04:31] <Randakar> swanfl: last time I tested anything like that desktop integration for such tools was less than steller, let alone attempting to run WoW from ext3 ;-)
[04:31] <Bastian_> belfegorash xchat = mirc yes
[04:31] <derFlo> swanfl: i used norton partition magic
[04:31] <Randakar> (which is the *only* reason for me to run windows, btw)
[04:31] <trappist> Randakar: http://fs-driver.org/
[04:31] <sc0tt> xchat better than mirc
[04:31] <sc0tt> :P
[04:31] <sc0tt> is better*
[04:31] <swanfl> ok
[04:31] <IdleOne> belfegorash:  /server irc.oldnetwork.com then join the channels you want
[04:31] <belfegorash> ok i understand but in undernet there arent usual channels:(
[04:32] <DjViper> help! I crashed X when I installed nvidia driver, how do I fix it?
[04:32] <IdleOne> Bastian_:  xchat doesnt not equal mirc xchat is > mirc :)
[04:32] <derFlo> is there any program for copying music onto my sony walkman mp3 player? it uses a database, so i cannot just copy in nautilus
[04:32] <djmccormick> how can i set up a static ip on my ubuntu 6.06 LTS command-line only box
[04:32] <Randakar> trappist: that works?
[04:32] <belfegorash> ok:)
[04:32] <belfegorash> thanks
[04:32] <ZeuGiRDoR> DjViper: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:32] <Guychi> IdleOne: I read but still don't get it: how do I install django? does the null apt-cache search django mean there isn't a apckage for it?
[04:33] <Bastian_> does any one know of an antiasl script for xchat that will ignore the persont that pms me?
[04:33] <TheGateKeeper> DjViper, always a good idea to backup xorg.conf
[04:33] <mormoloc> any suggestion on a low-cost model ink-jet printer for Buntu :) ( HP, Epson, Canon)?
[04:33] <IdleOne> Guychi:  did you enable universe and multiverse in the repositories?
[04:33] <trappist> Randakar: it claims to.  never tried it.
=== sadas is now known as Nestor
[04:33] <trappist> Randakar: I don't use windows, and I don't use ext filesystems :)
[04:33] <MarcN> derFlo: that is why I keep the receipts for MP3s that don't show up as a USB disk ;-)
[04:34] <TheGateKeeper> mormoloc, go & find the cheapest print cartridges, then buy that make & model of printer lol
=== _enabl is now known as enabl
[04:35] <derFlo> MarcN: My Mp3 Player is shown as usbdisk in nautilus.
[04:35] <cyzie> in debian, we have alsaconf, in ubuntu, how do i do that ?
[04:35] <Randakar> sounds like some testing is in order ;-)
[04:35] <derFlo> but it requires dbs to play the music
[04:35] <mormoloc> TheGateKeeper
[04:35] <mormoloc> TheGateKeeper: :)
[04:36] <TheGateKeeper> cyzie, the devs have removed alsaconf
[04:36] <TheGateKeeper> !sound
[04:36] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[04:36] <respa> how do I set reboot or halt or shutdown to be accessible from normal users?
[04:36] <TheGateKeeper> cyzie, ^^^ or post a bug
[04:37] <MarcN> derFlo: I usually buy Creative mp3 players and all I do is copy the files to the device.   Inexpensive too.
[04:37] <derFlo> MarcN: i just wanna have a solution for my problem ;)
[04:37] <derFlo> MarcN: what creative player you got?
[04:37] <Guychi> IdleOne: yes, I uncommented them in the sources.list Do I have to reboot or sth for it to take effect?
[04:38] <TheGateKeeper> Guychi, no iirc do apt-get update
[04:38] <MarcN> derFlo: MuVo TX FM 128 and 512 versions
[04:38] <AlphaN3> hello!
[04:38] <derFlo> sweet
[04:39] <TheGateKeeper> Guychi, rebooting is a M$ thing
[04:39] <derFlo> MarcN: i need a bit more space for music
[04:39] <foxstrot2008> h
[04:39] <foxstrot2008> hi people
[04:39] <AlphaN3> I'm on Xfce.. wondering which package of vim should I get, between vim-gnome and vim-gtk2.
[04:39] <foxstrot2008> got a Question
[04:39] <foxstrot2008> how can I install programs in my linux
[04:39] <Guychi> do apt-get and synaptic package manager mutually exclusve?
[04:39] <foxstrot2008> im a noob
[04:40] <derFlo> Synaptic, foxstrot2008
[04:40] <foxstrot2008> then
[04:40] <derFlo> or you download .deb packages
[04:40] <foxstrot2008> i see  that
[04:40] <derFlo> you search for what you want
[04:40] <citek> Can anybody explain to me on where and how I can install windows fonts with "wine"
[04:40] <MarcN> derFlo: I just copy to the device what I'm interested in for the day.
[04:41] <AlphaN3> i thought gnome utilizes gtk2... now i'm pretty confused.
[04:41] <DjViper> phew, got it to start up again
[04:41] <MarcN> derFlo: usually in front of a laptop with headphones anyway...
[04:41] <DjViper> thanks
[04:41] <Guychi> IdleOne:  I updated the universes, multiverses, and still can't find django. what am I missing?
[04:41] <derFlo> MarcN: sometimes i am in a hurry i wouldn have time for something like that :p
[04:41] <TheGateKeeper> Guychi, Synaptic is a gui for apt-get, but you need to close synaptic to use apt-get, you could press reload to refresh your sources
[04:41] <Guychi> TheGateKeeper: did just that. still no trace of django :(
[04:41] <sproingie> why does the little update applet decide I need a dist-upgrade?
[04:41] <sproingie> does it have some way of knowing a regular upgrade will fail without a dist-upgrade?
[04:42] <TheGateKeeper> Guychi, I am in gentoo at the moment, are you running firefox?
[04:43] <Guychi> TheGateKeeper: yes
[04:43] <Guychi> TheGateKeeper: what does FF have to do with it?
[04:43] <cappicrd> tell me
[04:43] <TheGateKeeper> Guychi, it has a package search engine
[04:43] <TheGateKeeper> use it to find which repo it is in
[04:44] <DutchR_PW> sproingie: It knows that because it sees a package which depends on another package which isn't installed
[04:44] <TheGateKeeper> Guychi, using edgy or dapper, & are your repos basically the default ones?
[04:45] <sproingie> DutchR_PW: ahh i see, thanks
[04:45] <AlphaN3> Uh... >_>
[04:45] <gerd> hello everybody
[04:45] <sproingie> i've never known the *real* difference between a dist-upgrade and an upgrade
[04:45] <gerd> i need help with tainted kernel
[04:45] <Guychi> TheGateKeeper: default ones, only dapper
[04:45] <sproingie> except for that dist-upgrades can remove packages
[04:45] <AlphaN3> I'm on Xubuntu (Xfce). What do I install, between vim-gtk2 and vim-gnome? Thank you in advance!
[04:46] <DutchR_PW> that basically is the only difference. dist-upgrade can install/remove other packages, while upgrade can only upgrade installed packages
[04:46] <sod75> gerd: just ask
[04:46] <TheGateKeeper> Guychi, http://za1012001.googlepages.com/modifyingubunturepositories
[04:47] <slick_nick> hi -- i tried moving my home directory to a different partition..when i restarted, KDE told me dcopserver wasn't running because iceauth failed to lock the .ICEauthority file
[04:47] <slick_nick> i've been trying to find a fix for the last hour or so, but no luck...can anyone please help?
[04:48] <gerd> i just installed linuxant linmodem driver and booted the system and i cannot boot..kernel tainted from hsfengine udev event
[04:48] <confusco> when I'm playing Flash videos like youtube or Google video, it all loads, but plays only for a few seconds. when I move the seek bar to a different position, it starts playing for a few seconds again, and stops. anybody have an idea?
[04:48] <TheGateKeeper> slick_nick, ask in either #kubuntu or #kde
[04:48] <slick_nick> TheGateKeeper: thanks

[04:48] <lele_> ciao
[04:49] <lele_> come faccio a sapere la grandezza delle mie partizioni?
[04:49] <sproingie> wow, bash completion is amazingly smart
[04:49] <sod75> gerd :tainted kernel is just a message saying it's no longer 100 free soft, shouldn't affect your ability to boot
[04:49] <DjViper> how do I figure out what sort of gfx card I have?
[04:49] <sproingie> it even knows how to complete with only modified files for 'hg revert'
[04:49] <tundejeg> has joined ubuntu
[04:49] <cratel2> does the linux-686 kernel work with an Athlon 64 processor?
[04:49] <tundejeg> cratel2
[04:49] <sod75> DjViper: open your pc and read
[04:49] <tundejeg> may i ask u a quetion
[04:50] <DjViper> sod75: laptop :P
[04:50] <tundejeg> question
[04:50] <citek> I am running ubuntu, I just installed "wine" i need to find the ~/.wine/drive_c/ folder,  where would this folder directory be located?
[04:50] <tundejeg> rather
[04:50] <sod75> DjViper: no sticky label then ? :)
[04:50] <tundejeg> have u ever installed oracle on ubuntu
[04:50] <gerd> <sod75> no i cannot boot only way i can boot is use another kernel installed
[04:50] <cratel2> tundejeg: nope. Sorry.
[04:50] <philip> big update this morning, 85.5MB
[04:50] <sod75> DjViper: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[04:50] <sproingie> cratel2: yes it works fine
[04:51] <tundejeg> ok
[04:51] <DutchR_PW> citek: it's a hidden directory located in your home directory. but if you have never ran wine, you might need to start winecfg first to generate that directory
[04:51] <Guychi> TheGateKeeper: I don't see the difference between what you sent and what I already have
[04:51] <cratel2> sproingie: thanks!
[04:51] <citek> I have ran wine, Can you please tell me where that "hidden" directory would be?
[04:51] <tundejeg> who has installed oracle on ubuntu
[04:51] <tundejeg> here
[04:51] <djmccormick> how can i make a user able to do sudo from the command line
[04:51] <DutchR_PW> press ctrl+h in nautilus
[04:51] <cratel2> citek: you described the directory exactly. Do you already know that ~ is your home directory?
[04:52] <gerd> <sod75> no i cannot boot only way i can boot is use another kernel installed
[04:52] <citek> Cratel2: No I didnt, Todays my first day on linux, Maybe I didn't run WINE than? But i have installed something with it and it supposedly made a Drive C:\, Any other idea's on where this could be located?
[04:53] <boriskuit> hi, any1 here?
[04:54] <sod75> gerd: sorry but I don't have a clue
[04:54] <nagashi> hi
=== domatism is now known as dogmatism
[04:54] <DutchR_PW> citek: you should run winecfg first, which will create that directory (and open a config window, which you can close then)
[04:55] <nagashi> guys how can I upgrade from drapper to edgy?
[04:55] <gerd> <sod75 can u look into my dmesg log if i send it to u
[04:55] <defrysk> !upgrade | nagashi
[04:55] <ubotu> nagashi: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:55] <boriskuit> fist type: sudo apt-get upgrade
[04:55] <citek> DutchR_PW: Thank you, I Think im catching on now!
[04:55] <boriskuit> than type: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:55] <derFlo> there ONE thing that prevents my of using ONLY linux..

[04:56] <ReinH> Hi guys, about to install ubuntu on my laptop, what would you suggest for partition sizes? 2xRAM for the swap, 10GB for root, another 20GBish for /home?
[04:56] <nagashi> k thanks
[04:56] <vandenoever> i've two machines on which i need the same software
[04:56] <boriskuit> guys, if i start theme-manger and i load a theme and there is no preview i cant apply it
[04:56] <Randakar> h3sp4wn: no, not related
[04:56] <boriskuit> how can i solve this problem?
[04:56] <Randakar> at least, not in any way that I can see
[04:57] <citek> DutchR_PW: Even after that, Still no Wine folder in my Home Directory?
[04:57] <DutchR_PW> have you enabled View hidden folders in your file manager?
[04:58] <ReinH> Guys, partition sizes? Any suggestions?
[04:58] <citek> DutchR_PW: Prob. Not, How Do I go about doing that?
[04:58] <DutchR_PW> press Ctrl+H in the file manager, or go to view>show hidden files

[05:02] <ReinH> Guys, any help with partitioning for a new ubuntu install please?
[05:02] <i7ch> ReinH, what sort of help do you need?

[05:02] <apokryphos> !partition
[05:02] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[05:02] <ReinH> I'd like any suggestions for the size of my root partition and swap partition, and any other tips
[05:02] <apokryphos> !gparted
[05:02] <ubotu> gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[05:03] <ReinH> apokryphos: yes, I'm aware of both of those, thank you
[05:03] <apokryphos> ReinH: root partition is good at around 8 gigs. Swap varies, but a gig is more than enough. Everything else for /home
[05:03] <gerd> <Rein H> make a wap patition of 256MB and and / partition of approx. 10GB will be fine
[05:03] <ReinH> apokryphos: thanks, which should be primary partitions and which extended? I've done this before but I can't remember of hand
[05:03] <citek> DutchR_PW: I'm trying to install Microsoft fonts, I installed them, but now I need to put them in my "C:\Windows\Fonts" from wine, Any idea on how I can recover where these files were installed?
[05:04] <i7ch> citek, find / -iname "*.ttf"
[05:04] <apokryphos> ReinH: root is generally primary, but it doesn't really matter
[05:04] <gerd> <sod75 i have pasted it at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35789/
[05:04] <Daviey> Hi, how can i make my output 16:9 (and not stretch the desktop)?
[05:04] <DutchR_PW> or go to fonts:/// in your file manager to view the installed fonts in linux, then you can copy them to .wine/drive_c/windows/fonts
[05:05] <sod75> gerd: the taints kernel message is nothing like I said, but "exec /usr/sbin/hsfconfig returned -1" is the error. no idea what's wrong though
[05:05] <citek> DutchR_PW: Where is my File Manger, Im so new to this!
[05:05] <gerd> actually i have removed hsf completley but still getting it at boot why
[05:06] <djmccormick> how do i give someone the ability to sudo?
[05:06] <DutchR_PW> where you found the .wine directory
[05:06] <ReinH> So is the rule I've heard about making your swap = 1.5x RAM not accurate?
=== johan_ is now known as dr_hell
[05:06] <apokryphos> djmccormick: sudo adduser someusername admin
[05:06] <nolimitsoya> djmccormick, add their name to the sudoers file :)
[05:06] <apokryphos> ReinH: it's not accurate at all. That was only a valuable principle many many years ago
[05:06] <sod75> gerd : it still loads the modules
[05:06] <ReinH> This laptop has 2GB, I don't want the swap to be too small.
[05:06] <apokryphos> it completely depends on how you use your computer. But 1 a gig is mroe than enough; even 500 or so should be fine.
[05:07] <apokryphos> ah
[05:07] <gerd> where are these modules since i have removed the package completely?
[05:07] <apokryphos> ReinH: put around 300 meg then, I'd say.
[05:07] <citek> DutchR_PW: There is no filemanager or fonts:/// in there.
[05:07] <ReinH> only 300meg? o.0
[05:07] <apokryphos> ReinH: I was presuming you'd have at least 80 gigs :P
[05:07] <ReinH> apokryphos: oh, I mean 2GB RAM
[05:07] <DutchR_PW> or you can press Alt+F2, type fonts:/// and press enter
[05:07] <apokryphos> ReinH: ohhhh
[05:07] <DutchR_PW> or press Ctrl+L in the file manager
[05:08] <citek> DutchR_PW: You are the man!!!
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> ReinH, you shouldnt need any swapspace with that amount of ram
[05:08] <ReinH> I've got 2x100GB HDDs but I'm only going to be using 40GB on one of them
[05:08] <apokryphos> ReinH: put as much as you like. It won't make too much difference. More than a gig won't really be useful though
[05:08] <Dimensions> hiii every one .. what does /dev/null do ??
[05:08] <kinga> hi there everybody. I have a connection problem on login. I need to manually disable and re-enable my interface in order to get Internet connectivity. Any idea how to overcome this?
[05:08] <ReinH> nolimitsoya: Makes sense...
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> ReinH, i seriously doubt that you even need that much ram, if you have to ask how much swapspace you need :)
[05:08] <i7ch> Dimensions, nothing. it's a virtual device that does nothing with all the data inputted to it.
[05:08] <jrib> Dimensions: think of it like a black hole
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> ReinH, sell me some and buy yourself a beer ;D
[05:08] <i7ch> Dimensions, or a garbage chute
[05:09] <Daviey> ReinH, It is normally recommend to have 50% of your ram as swap.  So 1gb
[05:09] <ReinH> nolimitsoya: Oh, I do for graphic design, music production, but I don't do that in linux :)
[05:09] <ReinH> nolimitsoya: I think I could get at least 3 beers
[05:09] <gerd> <sod75> hsfconfig is not even in the exec path..does it it have to do something in udev cionf
[05:09] <ReinH> But... inflation is a bitch
[05:09] <gerd> conf
[05:09] <nolimitsoya> ReinH, ill give you 4 coronas for 1gb. deal?
[05:09] <Daviey> ReinH, Inflation; depends if it is for a blow up doll
[05:09] <ReinH> nolimitsoya: sure, where do I mail it? :p
[05:09] <Dimensions> i7ch:  then what does this line means in the crontab ... * * * * * /tmp/.psy/y2kupdate >/dev/null 2>&1
[05:09] <A3n> configured network card correctly with ndiswrapper (driver present, hardware present) and configured wireless device with iwconfig and found my Access Point with "iwlist eth2(my wireless device) scan" , but somehow dhclient cant find the DHCPOFFER's so i cant connect, i dont know what to do...
[05:10] <sod75> gerd: tried doing a purge of the package ?
[05:10] <gerd> yes
[05:10] <i7ch> Dimensions, it means that it runs the y2kupdate program, but instead of displaying the output of the program or saving it in a file, it just throws it out
[05:10] <sod75> no idea about udev
[05:11] <gouki> A3n: Are you sure the DHCP server isn't out of IP's?
[05:11] <i7ch> Dimensions, in other words, it means "just run y2kupdate, but i don't care what it outputs, just run it quietly and let it do what it wants"
[05:11] <A3n> i'm sure
[05:11] <sod75> gerd: search your /lib/modules for hsf* maybe ?
[05:11] <gouki> A3n: Is it a router?
[05:11] <A3n> gouki:from 50 - 58 and there is only 2 pc's connected atm
[05:11] <A3n> gouki:yes
[05:11] <Dimensions> ahhan ... but i donno what is this y2kupdate ...
[05:11] <gouki> A3n: Linksys?
[05:11] <sod75> gerd: or check the contecnt of the package to see what it did
[05:12] <ragamuffin> Can I repartition an existing ntfs drive using ubuntu and without losing datat?
[05:12] <gouki> ragamuffin: I recommend using gParted Live CD
[05:12] <nolimitsoya> ragamuffin, in theory, yes.
[05:12] <kinga> ragamuffin: yes no problem
[05:12] <gerd> <sod75i even uninstalled the kernel and resticted drivers but didnot purge thes
[05:12] <ReinH> ragamuffin: yes, I've done it before and I'm doing it right now.
[05:12] <A3n> gouki:sitecom WL-121v2 chipset Intersil ISL Prism Javelin/Oxbow
[05:12] <i7ch> Dimensions, hold on, i'll look it up
[05:13] <nolimitsoya> ragamuffin, in practice, you need to be aware of a few caveats, and you should have a backup
[05:13] <ReinH> gParted Live CD is nice, some ubuntu discs include gParted as well
[05:13] <ReinH> But, yes, backup, backup, backup
[05:13] <A3n> gouki:Xbow*
[05:13] <gouki> A3n: There is not type of MAC filtering enabled?
[05:13] <gouki> *no type
[05:13] <A3n> ow i hope not
[05:13] <A3n> gouki:is there a default mac filtering?
[05:13] <ReinH> o.0
[05:14] <gouki> A3n: No, there isn't
[05:14] <gerd> with another downgraded kernel i am able to boot and i have no hsf installed
[05:14] <MitchM> jono ping
[05:14] <A3n> gouki:then i suppose there isnt any enabled
[05:14] <Dimensions> thanks i7ch
[05:14] <gouki> A3n: Is the NIC configured to DHCP instead of static IP configuration?
[05:14] <i7ch> Dimensions, something to do with apache, i think. look up y2kupdate in google and read up.
[05:15] <A3n> gouki:dont know about that
[05:15] <ragamuffin> When I choose to resize an ntfs partition, the first partition or the latter one is for the extisting data?
[05:15] <gouki> A3n: Is this a wireless or wired NIC?

[05:18] <sod75> gerd: or maybe some init script in /etc/rc.d ...
[05:18] <A3n> gouki:k
[05:18] <TheGateKeeper> ragamuffin, you need a minimum of about 5gb, the gparted livecd might be more helpfull
[05:18] <gouki> A3n: There is isn't much of a configuration to router DHCP server. Just lease time, # of IPs and network

[05:38] <apokryphos> blk^: go to the link that talks about compiling

[05:47] <ninix> i got a big problem.... i can do nothing now.... my system is broken... cause of libpthread.so.0
[05:47] <ninix> what can i do...
[05:47] <A3n> ninix:format?
[05:48] <nolimitsoya> ninix, you could try being specific. :)
[05:48] <ninix> nolimitsoya: ok :P
[05:48] <ProN00b> ninix, did you replace that file somehow ?
[05:48] <ninix> ls: error while loading shared librairies: /lib/libpthread.so.0
[05:49] <ProN00b> ninix, you propably corrupted that file somehow
[05:49] <engla> like with prelink?
[05:49] <engla> ninix: you could try and fix it with the live cd, replacing that file. But that could be difficult
[05:50] <mypapit> nurullah?
[05:50] <ninix> i tryed to fix the problem of an application .... i just cp /lib32/libpthrea.... to /lib64/..
[05:50] <mypapit> hmmm
[05:50] <nolimitsoya> engla, why would it?
[05:50] <engla> nolimitsoya: be what?
[05:50] <nolimitsoya> engla, difficult :)

[05:50] <engla> nolimitsoya: dunno. User error? misunderestimating the problem

[05:51] <claviola> I'm trying to burn a data DVD for a friend but Nautilus tells me that it won't be compatible with Windows due to the accents.  I tried to go ahead and do it with growisofs and the accents did indeed come out garbled.  Has anyone come across such an issue before?
[05:51] <nolimitsoya> claviola, just remove the accents ;)
[05:51] <claviola> The filenames are using UTF-8.
[05:52] <claviola> nolimitsoya: that's not an option...
[05:52] <QwertyM> my F-Spot Photo Manager doesnt open, and it came default with the Ubuntu Edgy installation!
[05:52] <nolimitsoya> claviola, then youll have to accept that windows cant read it.filenames on windows cant contain accent
[05:52] <nolimitsoya> *s
[05:52] <claviola> nolimitsoya: uh, yes they can.
[05:53] <nolimitsoya> claviola, no, utf chars with accents turn out garbage
[05:53] <scylax> hi. how can i configure /usr/bin/mail so it uses a SMTP server which is installed in another machine?
[05:53] <engla> ninix: can't you undo that copy. I don't know about the problems of the two lib dirs lib32 and lib64 though
[05:54] <Imrahil> I am getting a new thinkpad t60. would the ipw3945 be a better choice than the atheros? range and power consumption are priorities.
[05:54] <ninix> can't undo... i gonna boot on the live cd...
[05:54] <nolimitsoya> engla,ninix, booting the live cd, mounting and cp:ing the file from the live environment would be far easier
[05:54] <Solarion> when will the splice() system call become documented?  It should be in the edgy kernel (2.6.17), but I can't find the manpage on it.
[05:54] <claviola> nolimitsoya: I've seen data CD/DVDs before that had accents.  it must be possible.
[05:54] <ninix> i hope it's gonna work
[05:54] <engla> nolimitsoya: right
[05:54] <claviola> like, windows users manage to burn their stuff with accents.
[05:54] <nolimitsoya> claviola, then you need an other char encoding :) just as nautilus told you.
[05:55] <claviola> nolimitsoya: I tried both ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8.
[05:55] <nolimitsoya> claviola, well thats strange...
[05:55] <claviola> it seems odd that nautilus would just naturally crap out on UTF-8 filenames, though
[05:55] <claviola> since it is, if I recall correctly, the default

[06:17] <philo23> :(
[06:17] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: I haven't I'll poke around there.  Thanks
[06:17] <LjL> jamesbrose, type "dpkg -S etc/init.d/functions", outputs anything?
[06:17] <al> philo23 : go with a Knoppix LiveCD
[06:17] <jamesbrose> dpkg: *etc/init.d/functions* not found.
[06:17] <fromvega> Hello! Please, could you help-me with Squid ?
[06:17] <fromvega>  I'm getting the following error: squid: "ERROR: No running copy". I have restarted Ubuntu, removed the squid package, restarted Ubuntu again, installed the squid package again and I still receive the same error! How come? Could you help-me? Tks!
[06:17] <jamesbrose> LjL, dpkg: *etc/init.d/functions* not found.
[06:18] <philo23> al: doesnt the ubuntu live cd use it to partition the hdd to start with, would that not mean its installed on that?
[06:18] <QwertyM> !fspot
[06:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fspot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:18] <nolimitsoya> al, philo23, use the live cd instead. though i dont think that anyone who tries to repartition/format the current working partition should be doing anything on an important system...
[06:19] <LjL> jamesbrose: as i thought. that file was installed by something external (likely a separate vmware installation); i don't have it on my machine, and it's what causing the trouble with your installation, at least the trouble that can be seen from your paste.
[06:19] <al> philo23 : it should do it to...just work while your system partition is not running
[06:19] <P3L|C4N0> greetings
[06:19] <philo23> al: ok
[06:19] <jamesbrose> LjL, what do you think I should do then?
[06:19] <Imrahil> aconbere|work, looks like there are a few bugs on redraw problems in edgy
[06:19] <jamesbrose> How could I manually unistall and old version of vmware
[06:19] <PaSurf> what is with edgy eft where the software basically is working great, but when I go to open documents (pdf) or try to shut down the system it basically does not respond and has to be "choked" out and restarted?
[06:19] <LjL> jamesbrose: try "sudo apt-get --purge remove vmware-player", then remove anything related to vmware that you can find, then try again installing
[06:20] <LjL> jamesbrose, i don't know... unless they come with an uninstall script, it will be guesswork mostly
[06:20] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/rdesktop/+bug/68583
[06:20] <aconbere|work> yup
[06:20] <aconbere|work> that looks like it precisely
[06:20] <aconbere|work> :P
[06:20] <fromvega> anyone?
[06:20] <zspada15> fromvega, anyone what?
[06:21] <fromvega> zspada15: I'm with problems wih Squid. I'm getting the following error: squid: "ERROR: No running copy". I have restarted Ubuntu, removed the squid package, restarted Ubuntu again, installed the squid package again and I still receive the same error! How come? Could you help-me? Tks!
[06:21] <LjL> jamesbrose: "find /etc | grep -i vmware" and "find /usr | grep -i vmware" will probably help
[06:21] <fromvega> zspada15: could you help-me?
[06:21] <nikin> hy
[06:21] <Imrahil> aconbere|work, are you using nvidia?
[06:21] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: yup!
[06:21] <zspada15> fromvega, im not quite sure
[06:21] <zspada15> !squid
[06:21] <ubotu> squid: Internet Object Cache (WWW proxy cache). In component main, is optional. Version 2.6.1-3ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 576 kB, installed size 1524 kB
[06:21] <fromvega> zspada15: nobody is alive at #squid
[06:21] <chosi> I got a problem with my X, I suppose.... -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35791/ any ideas?
[06:21] <nikin> can someone help me to set a writable FTP directory with proFTPD
[06:22] <nikin> ?
[06:22] <zspada15> fromvega, try www.squidcache.org
[06:22] <Imrahil> aconbere|work, try using opensource nv driver to see if that happens
[06:23] <LjL> jamesbrose: also are you sure your edgy is up to date? i.e. you have edgy, edgy-updates and edgy-security enabled for restricted, main, universe and multiverse, and you ran an upgrade recently?
[06:23] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: heh If I use the opensource drivers glx craps out and I essentially have the problem but when using everyday windowing :)
[06:23] <jamesbrose> Yes
[06:23] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: I'll live with crappy rdesktop over that
[06:23] <nikin> anyone experience with rpFTPD?
[06:23] <nikin> *proFTPD
[06:24] <Imrahil> aconbere|work, yeah of course. I just meant as a means to comment results on the bug report
[06:24] <anuragJ> zspada15, err www.squid-cache.org
[06:24] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: ahhh, hmm yeah I could try that I out I suppose
[06:24] <zspada15> anuragJ, thanks
[06:24] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: but it will have to wait until I get some stuff done
[06:24] <Imrahil> aconbere|work, bugs with more traffic tend to get fixed sooner in my experience
[06:24] <aconbere|work> I'll stick around here for a while, but for now back to work
[06:25] <anuragJ> and fromvega, why you need proxies
[06:25] <aconbere|work> Imrahil: yes in mine as well :)
[06:25] <chosi> "X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 168" <- ???!?
[06:25] <nikin> can then anyone suggest a good FTP server capable of managing Anonymus FTP with RW acces?
[06:25] <A3n> i got a big wireless internet problem
[06:25] <anuragJ> nikin, gFTP
[06:25] <A3n> all explained here:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35792/ can anyone help me with it?
[06:27] <fromvega> anurag: do to what proxies were meant to do
[06:27] <nolimitsoya> nikin, profptd?
[06:27] <zspada15> A3n, ill try to help
[06:27] <nikin> nolimitso: yup i tryed that
[06:27] <zspada15> A3n, its the bcm4318?
[06:27] <nikin> but could not get a writable dir
[06:27] <nolimitsoya> nikin, and whats wrong with it?
[06:27] <nolimitsoya> nikin, have you checked the man files?
[06:28] <nikin> yuo
[06:28] <nikin> yes
[06:28] <A3n> zspada15: Intersil Prism Javelin/Xbow
[06:28] <anuragJ> fromvega, get the source from the main site and compile.
[06:28] <zspada15> A3n, sudo lspci and paste it to me in a pm
[06:28] <nikin> and i read some articles about it,  and the Debian Bible
[06:29] <zspada15> A3n, dont paste the whole thing
[06:29] <nikin> but is
[06:29] <elro> Hi there, is there an easy way to configure a second network card with 6.10 server?
[06:29] <zspada15> A3n, just the part with your wifi card in it
[06:29] <fromvega> anuragJ: why? it was running smoothly until something f***ed things up... squid: "ERROR: No running copy".
[06:29] <nikin> but i still could not have a writable directory
[06:30] <nolimitsoya> nikin, have you tried the guide on the wiki?
[06:30] <nikin> nolimitso: nope
[06:31] <jrib> fromvega: does squid normally start automatically on boot?
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> nikin, then please do. :) did it for me the first time round
[06:31] <fromvega> jrib: yes
[06:31] <anuragJ> fromvega, I've no idea what went wrong, untill until you say me what you have done.
[06:31] <jrib> fromvega: what do you do to get that error?
[06:31] <nikin> nolimitso: can you give me the adress of it?
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> nikin, one moment
[06:32] <ubun> i know ubuntu can detect my ipod and even let me browse files on it in nautilus by default but is there a way to transfer music to it by default and if not what do i need to get?

[06:35] <kaoru_too> while running "software update" i had a power supply fail on me this morning...is there anyway to tell if they were installed properly?
[06:35] <maciek> czlowiek przez winde to sie leniwy zrobil
[06:35] <kaoru_too> like i'm not sure of what the progress what when the computer went down
[06:35] <ubun> i dont see 'banshee' in synaptic for some reason
[06:35] <goomie> I just reinstalled windows so the grub boot loader got pwn'd how do i get grub back (dpkg-reconfigure grub ?)?
[06:35] <fromvega> jrib: ok, could you explain what does it do?

[06:36] <jrib> fromvega: first part lists files that got installed and the second part looks for anything in /etc/init.d.  I'm trying to see if there is a squid script there that gets called when you boot.  That way we can run it now and see if we can get any errors
[06:36] <zspada15> A3n, oh
[06:36] <anuragJ> nikin, and http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html
[06:36] <zspada15> A3n, ok
[06:36] <zspada15> your going to want to sudo iwconfig ap 00:OC:F6:03:96:BA
[06:37] <fromvega> jrib: ok, I'm just typing it
[06:37] <fromvega> jrib, the output is: /etc/init.d    /etc/init.d/squid
[06:38] <A3n> zspada but ap is already set to that

[06:39] <spinz8r> hi, i am trying to compile linux driver (BT usb dongle) but cant run ./configure, make,make install. What's wrong?
[06:39] <ubun> i have amarok but not banshee in synaptic. amarok says it's for kde, i take it banshee was for gnome? i dont have gtkpod in synaptic either so i guess i'll have to install amarok
[06:39] <jrib> ubun: you can use amarok in gnome
[06:39] <jrib> !info gtkpod

[06:39] <dsnyders> spinz8r, Are you getting any error messages?
[06:39] <jrib> ubun: you need to enable universe for banshee and gtkpod
[06:39] <ubun> ah so it's just not as 'free'?
[06:40] <spinz8r> dsnyders: nope.
[06:40] <ubun> oh wait universe is free stuff just not as 'supported' right
[06:40] <fromvega> jrib, and now?
[06:40] <tomix> exit
[06:40] <jrib> ubun: the things in universe are free, they just don't have gauranteed security updates from the main ubuntu team
[06:40] <nolimitsoya> ubun, yes it is. its just not packaged by canonical, but by motus
[06:40] <jrib> fromvega: what was the output
[06:40] <ubun> how do you enable universe in synaptic
[06:40] <jrib> !universe | ubun

[06:40] <ubun> thanks
[06:41] <dsnyders> spinz8r, If you're not getting any error messages, what makes you think it didn't work?
[06:41] <fromvega> jrib, Starting proxy server: squid.
[06:41] <jrib> fromvega: does your failed command from before still fail?
[06:41] <Valmarko> what is the plugin I have to use to play windows media content. I'm using gmplayer for tv streaming but it reports an error

[06:43] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, sound like your sources.list has been flushed :)
[06:43] <nikin> nolimitso: but there is no file called /etc/proftpd.conf
[06:44] <nolimitsoya> nikin, create one then
[06:44] <nikin> there is one called /etc/proftp/proftpd.conf ... is that ok?
[06:44] <nolimitsoya> nikin, yes, use that

[06:45] <chosi> yeah
[06:45] <chosi> and somebody please help me :(
[06:46] <mluser-work> nolimitsoya: ooops.. sorry

[06:46] <Bakefy> I don't know how to add repositories in this version of ubuntu 6.10
[06:47] <nolimitsoya> Bakefy, same way as any version
[06:47] <fromvega> jrib, same error, I think that the problem is with .pid file

[06:47] <Bakefy> nolimitsoya, I thought that you added them in the synaptic package manager
[06:47] <nikin> nolimitso: can you sen me your proFTPD.conf?
[06:48] <nolimitsoya> Bakefy, you could, but i dont wuite see the point...
[06:48] <fromvega> jrib: tks

[06:49] <nikin> nolimitso: bl for me
[06:49] <ubun> my sister and her bf who know almost nothing about computers, but have used windows to surf the web, said they want ubuntu on their pc after using it on my computer last night heh. they said it's "smooth" and easier to use
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> ubun, good :)
[06:49] <ubun> i guess it's easier to use in some senses once it's already set upt, but i know ill be the one setting it up =p
[06:50] <allmanj> anyone here who knows the internals of debian-installer?
[06:50] <nolimitsoya> ubun, not much to set up realy... just install and use :)
[06:50] <nolimitsoya> allmanj, define 'internals' :)
[06:50] <xored> if i use a software peace ( FCKeditor ) which is published under lgpl and build an web application with it, without chaning it, do i have to publish the whole code of the application "public" or only the part of FCKeditor, which maybe have changed ?
[06:51] <Doow> what's the command to try and repair a system? (package-wise)
[06:51] <ubun> nolimitosoya, true for just the web surfing that they'll mainly be doing and they have web email so that kills 2 birds
[06:51] <allmanj> i'm attempting to make a modified version of the alternate cd to minimise the amount of user interaction needed. i want it not to scan a mirror as im not guaranteed network connectivity
[06:51] <ubun> i should put it on an xbox and make it like a webtv
[06:51] <nolimitsoya> xored, youd have to release the code of anything that can be thought of as deriveative work
[06:52] <allmanj> i've been trawling around and somehow the .disk/base_installable is important. I think i need to make choose-mirror happy to just install from cd
[06:52] <allmanj> but nothing i try seems to work

[06:52] <nolimitsoya> allmanj, couldnt you use the oem install mode?
[06:52] <Bakefy> nolimitsoya, my version (6.10 Edgy) is different
[06:53] <nolimitsoya> Bakefy, from what?
[06:53] <allmanj> nolimitsoya: ? i don't know what you mean?
[06:53] <Bakefy> The instructions
[06:53] <nolimitsoya> allmanj, when booting the alternate cd, there is an option for oem installs.
[06:53] <JackUK> hi everyone, I have a problem with my ATI drivers that I was wondering if someone could help me with?
[06:53] <nolimitsoya> Bakefy, then adapt them. its perfectly simple: just add the aptline to /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:54] <Bakefy> nolimitsoya, I am trying to do this the gui way, I guess I will try the text
[06:54] <allmanj> nolimitsoya: what's it supposed to do? how would it help me? Is it on dapper or just edgy?
[06:55] <wuming> how can I boot to a ubuntu partition, if my mbr covered by windows xp?

[06:57] <AlphaN3> Hmph.. Can anyone tell me how I can get native-looking (i.e. themed) scrollbar in my XEmacs?
[06:57] <nolimitsoya> Thawin, 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[06:57] <nikin> nolimitso: its getting worse, i cant even connect now
[06:57] <nikin> mc
[06:57] <solem> how can i build a deb file from source? that check for deps aswel.
[06:57] <solem> :)
[06:57] <Thawin> ok, thxs. I try
[06:57] <jrib> solem: help.ubuntu.com has a guide
[06:57] <allmanj> nolimitsoya: not exactly what i want. That mode requires you to do the install first and then it bothers the user less. What i want is to customise exactly what gets installed
[06:58] <allmanj> so i can just provide a cd and i know they can't screw it up
[06:59] <drach> Hello, I have problem with raid0, system is not able to mount /dev/md0 (md0 starts without problems) during ubuntu start, I aded /dev/md0 in fstab, but after  system boot /dev/md0 is not mounted
[06:59] <solem> hum.. that looks quite advanced... i just want to make a deb fast and easy... not with diz etc
[06:59] <drkm> does anyone have a link to how i can burn ubuntu to cd to boot off it?
[07:00] <drkm> so i don't have to install it
[07:00] <Jaak_> what is the driver name of the official ati driver?
[07:00] <nolimitsoya> allmanj, you could set itup once, and then dd and copy to every other hdd :)
[07:00] <jrib> solem: for what you ask, you need to understand how debs work
[07:00] <Jaak_> right now i have Ati, the opensource one
[07:00] <bluefox83> drkm, the cds are all live, you can run them without installing
[07:00] <solem> bah... i had a link before :S
[07:00] <bluefox83> sept for the server one, and i think the alternate one
[07:00] <jrib> solem: maybe checkinstall?  This will not do what you asked however
[07:00] <Gasten> drkm: burn the lvecd and it does what u want.
[07:00] <drkm> ok thnanks
[07:00] <solem> okey.
[07:01] <solem> i used that before yes

[07:06] <Alakazamz0r> DjViper, checking.
[07:07] <DjViper> Alakazamz0r: its the font used when typing in logon and pw heh
[07:07] <php-freak> Hey guys how do I download all folders through command line ftp, I know mget * gets all the files, but not the folders.
[07:07] <DjViper> its weird, like 3x normal size
[07:07] <Alakazamz0r> yeah, the GDM login screen?
[07:07] <DjViper> everything else semms ok
[07:07] <DjViper> yes
[07:07] <DjViper> seems*
[07:07] <kling0n> DjViper:  might be becasue the resolution is too low
[07:07] <kingrayray> or dpi
[07:07] <kling0n> because
[07:07] <DjViper> 1920x1440 is too low?
[07:07] <Alakazamz0r> yeah, or DPI would be something to check into.
[07:07] <Alakazamz0r> No, that wouldn't be.
[07:08] <DjViper> dpi, how do I check taht
[07:08] <kling0n> DjViper:  is the resolution correct once you've logged in?
[07:08] <DjViper> kling0n: res is ok even in gdm
[07:08] <kling0n> ok
[07:08] <DjViper> only the font is messed up
[07:09] <kingrayray> i don't remember how to fix it, its a setting in xorg.conf regarding your physical screen size
[07:09] <kingrayray> hold on a second, DjViper
[07:09] <kingrayray> i'll get you a relevant link
[07:09] <Alakazamz0r> yeah, kingrayray's on it.

[07:15] <nikin> can anyone suggest an eaasy to configure ftp server for an Anonymus FTP?
[07:16] <Alakazamz0r> nikin, proftpd

[07:17] <Skyrail> any idea?
[07:18] <teicah> say i removed lftp from default edgy.. how do i re-install it from the cd?
[07:19] <Pelo> good afternoon folks

[07:21] <DeamonminD> hello evryone
=== will__ is now known as willskills
[07:21] <DeamonminD> can anyone tell me how to install gtk themes?
[07:22] <DeamonminD> i m new to linux
[07:22] <Pelo> DeamonminD,  did you already dl the theme from somewhere ?
[07:22] <teicah> DeamonminD: system|preferences|theme .. install theme
[07:22] <sysdoc> DeamonminD, welcome to the REAL world....lol
[07:22] <Amorgin> ou.
[07:23] <DeamonminD> i heard we need to compile something .. someone on dalnet tolf me
[07:23] <CydeWeys> Is this supposed to happen?  I installed a server version of Ubuntu 6.10 from CD and it didn't come with gcc installed?!?!
[07:23] <DeamonminD> told*
[07:23] <teicah> or unpack them and dump'em in ~/.themes
[07:23] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: why would you want gcc on a server?
[07:24] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: Is that a rhetorical question?
[07:24] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: many security guru would frown upon this
[07:24] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: Really?
[07:24] <DeamonminD> all i have to download the gtk theme and put it in themes folder?
[07:24] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: I dunno, I find it hard to compile a lot of stuff I need to run as server applications when I don't have a compiler ..
[07:24] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: with gcc on a server, malicious coode can do even more malicious things..
[07:25] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: for servers, the admin precompiles somewhere else......
[07:25] <teicah> DeamonminD: unpack it first
[07:25] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: Okay, let me explain a bit more.  I only have two Linux machines.  Both are "servers" in the sense that they sit somewhere and I only access them remotely.
[07:25] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: but paranoids would not use a kernel with modules enabled on a server, so it's another story probably.
[07:25] <DeamonminD> teicah: after unpack i m supposed to put it in themes folder?
[07:26] <teicah> hidden folder ".themes"  note the preceding dot.. in your home directory.. yes
[07:26] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: to make a long story short, you probably just need to install "buid-essentials"
[07:26] <Pelo> DeamonminD,  you probably don'T even have to unpack and the install feature will likely put it in the right folder itself
[07:27] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: E: Couldn't find package buid-essentials
[07:27] <teicah> then go to system|preferences|theme and you should be able to see/use your new theme
[07:27] <CydeWeys> You mean build-essentialls?
[07:27] <DeamonminD> Thanx :D
[07:27] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: yes, sorry for the typo
[07:27] <Pelo> CydeWeys,  no S at the end
[07:27] <CydeWeys> Okay, good, that seems to have the essentials that I need.
[07:27] <CydeWeys> gcc didn't get everything
[07:28] <teicah> DeamonminD: if you want all users to be able to use the theme.. put it in /usr/share/themes
=== RiNG is now known as [RiNG] 
[07:28] <DeamonminD> okies :D
[07:28] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: Thanks for that tip, I was also having problems getting SLIME to compile and now it's working.
[07:28] <Huiber1> !slime
[07:28] <ubotu> slime: Superior LISP Interaction Mode for Emacs. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:20060618-1 (edgy), package size 548 kB, installed size 1452 kB
[07:29] <CydeWeys> (Getting greeted with "Connected. Cyde, this could be the start of a beautiful program." everytime you start up SLIME is neato, too.)
[07:29] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: hmm, ok
[07:29] <fromvega> hello agin
[07:29] <fromvega> gain
[07:29] <fromvega> again
[07:29] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: SLIME is very good for writing Lisp.  If you don't write lots of Lisp, you probably don't need to worry about SLIME.
[07:29] <Skyrail> I'm trying to install/compile something but it carries on stopping as it can't find the qt library? any ideas?
[07:29] <Huiber1> we get the point
[07:29] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: no need, I'm a Java devel myself
[07:29] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: SLIME isn't available as a Ubuntu package either, which is rather annoying.  It *should* be.
[07:30] <fromvega> sorry, who was helping me with SQUID process here?
[07:30] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: Speaking of Java, which Ubuntu package do I install to get javac?
[07:30] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: ubotu says it's in edgy?
[07:30] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: I'm running 6.10
[07:30] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: then slime should be available....
[07:30] <fromvega> jrib: you
[07:30] <fromvega> jrib: are you there?
[07:31] <jrib> fromvega: me?  yes, what's up
[07:31] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: I couldn't find it.
[07:31] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: brb checking my java install
[07:31] <Huiber1> !slime > CydeWeys
[07:31] <Skyrail> anyone?
[07:31] <fromvega> jrib: I have removed squid with apt-get but when I type "ps ax | grep squid" I receive "9821 pts/1 R+ 0:00 grep squid" as the ouput. Does it mean that squid is running?
[07:32] <sysrage> no
[07:32] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: "Package slime is not available, but is referred to by another package.  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source."
[07:32] <ubun> it's amazing that there's almost a thousand people in here and i'd say i've seen at least 95% of all questions get answered 24/7
[07:32] <DeamonminD> teicah: do u know any transparent theme for gnome?
[07:32] <jrib> fromvega: nope, that means 'grep squid' is runnning
[07:32] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: E: Package slime has no installation candidate
[07:32] <PriceChild> ubun: Don't you love the ubuntu community :)
[07:32] <ubun> =] 
[07:32] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: hmmm, ubotu is lying :-(
[07:32] <CydeWeys> fromvega: Try /etc/init.d/squid stop
[07:32] <Lam_> how do i generate a new hash for xorg.conf?
[07:33] <teicah> DeamonminD: transparent? gtk theme? or metacity?  i don't think i undersatnd your q
[07:33] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: It's not a big deal, I already downloaded and compiled from CVS, and the CVS version is kept more up-to-date than the package anyway.
[07:33] <meshugga> chaps, i need assistance with ati dualhead
[07:33] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: here at home I installed sun-java5-jdb and more from the multiverse repos
[07:33] <DeamonminD> what is difference b/w gtk theme and metacity?
[07:33] <DeamonminD> :S?
[07:33] <fromvega> jrib, CydeWeys: I have executed apt-get remove squid but its folder is still there...
[07:33] <meshugga> i want to run two different x servers on each head
[07:33] <meshugga> of my thinkpad t30
[07:33] <meshugga> any hints?
[07:34] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: at work I use a version from ubuntutower.net (because then sun java was not directly available in ubuntu)
[07:34] <meshugga> i remember being an howto out there, but i miss the google magic to find it
[07:34] <DeamonminD> :(
[07:34] <teicah> gtk dresses apps .. metacity deals with window decorations (borders)
[07:34] <jrib> fromvega: you need to remove it with the --purge option:  sudo apt-get --purge remove squid, and you probably also need to remove the dependencies like squid-common
[07:34] <DeamonminD> ahan okies
[07:35] <DeamonminD> so metacity themes wud be transparent rite?
[07:35] <teicah> have you visited gnome-look.org?
[07:35] <DeamonminD> yes just entered in it
[07:36] <teicah> actually neither .. i think.. to support really transparency .. you need something like beryl .. and if you are a newbie.. you have quite a bit of reading ahead, but nothing too dificult
[07:36] <dbcalo> does anyone here know how to get cedega to run correctly on ubuntu edgy?
[07:37] <fromvega> jrib: tks, I'll try
[07:37] <DeamonminD> teicah: what is beryl?
[07:37] <teicah> check what you can do w/it http://tinyurl.com/vuyxq

[07:38] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: I can't seem to find sun-java5-jdb , even in the multiverse?
[07:38] <teicah> DeamonminD: check it out http://www.beryl-project.org/
[07:38] <jrib> CydeWeys: what is jdb?
[07:38] <DeamonminD> okies
[07:38] <DeamonminD> :)
[07:38] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: are you using synaptic? my ypos should not bother you that much :-)
[07:38] <dbcalo> Huiberl, it consistently crashes ubuntu for me.
[07:38] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: It's called a jdk..
[07:38] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: You typoed again :-/
[07:39] <DeamonminD> teicah: i need to download something for beryl?
[07:39] <Huiber1> dbcalo: hmmm, I installed under dapper, then upgrade to edgy latter, nevver had any probs, sorry
[07:39] <aguz> i need help with LimeWire please :S
[07:39] <CydeWeys> Huiber1: No, I'm not using Synaptic ... isn't that GUI-only?  I'm just using apt-get.
[07:39] <teicah> definately
[07:39] <CydeWeys> Anyway, now that I spelled jdk correctly I did find the package in the multiverse.
[07:40] <Huiber1> CydeWeys: yeah, I like typing fast, and allmost allways forget to speelcheck :-)

[07:59] <php-freak> im at the ftp prompt
[07:59] <crackcorn> from what i can find, i might need to install kcontrol, do you think that would have any issues with gnome
[07:59] <Arkangel> eee
[07:59] <Arkangel> hello
[07:59] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, that wont happen. windows user, are you? read up on mountpoints
[07:59] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, linux isnot windows, in any way.
[07:59] <Jumper> no   and yes re windows user :)
[07:59] <Jumper> I use Xandros 90% of the time
[08:00] <Mr_Scorpio> Hello.
[08:00] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, you cant access physical devices. neither in windows or unix. you access partitions, and these are mounted. in windows they mount as c:/ d:/ etc, and in unix they mount as a folder of you chioce
[08:00] <Pie-rate> is there any way to remove the title bar of a window?
[08:00] <nolimitsoya> *coice
[08:00] <Jumper> I use their file manager, I see my "filesystem" and also can expand and see both physical drives and all partitions.  and copy/use files among them all
[08:00] <nolimitsoya> *h
[08:00] <Pie-rate> in gnome?
[08:00] <crackcorn> is there a way to remove openoffice without having it uninstall or break ubuntu desktop
[08:00] <LjL> php-freak, err, you don't need to be at the ftp prompt, but on a shell prompt
[08:01] <LjL> !wget
[08:01] <PriceChild> crackcorn: it doesn't matter if you uninstall ubuntu-desktop
[08:01] <ubotu> wget: retrieves files from the web. In component main, is standard. Version 1.10.2-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 226 kB, installed size 1952 kB
[08:01] <PriceChild> crackcorn: ubuntu-desktop is just a fake package, which installs everything else to make sure upgrades go well
[08:01] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, you wont get that. get used to it ;)
[08:01] <Mr_Scorpio> How do I uninstall Xgl and Compiz!?
[08:01] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, mount at a conviniet place instead
[08:01] <PriceChild> Mr_Scorpio: follow the guide you used to install them... just backwards
[08:01] <Jumper> I have it now using xandros file manager
[08:01] <php-freak> I see
[08:01] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, also, all drivermount under /media in ubuntu
[08:01] <php-freak> ljl
[08:02] <Jumper>  and similar using knoquerer id I recall name in some distro's I have looked at
[08:02] <thespore> How can I disable the login box that comes up when you try to bring the desktop back up after screensaver kicks in?
[08:02] <gop> hey
[08:02] <Jumper> ok, maybe it is there, all the "partitions"  I was looking in /mnt
[08:02] <gop> beside fs-driver is thier any other way to mount ext3 filesystem in windows
[08:02] <PriceChild> thespore: system>preferences>screensaver. its one of the checkboxes there
[08:03] <PriceChild> gop: not that i know of
[08:03] <enyc> gop: im sure ther are a few different drivers
[08:03] <gop> fs-driver don't seem to work for me
[08:03] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, but not in ubuntu, unless you start making symlinks and bookmarks. do it the right way instead of the windows-look-alike way, wich is very inefficiet anyway
[08:03] <klick> hey all, can anyone tell me why "xset s blank" doesn't blank my screen imediately?
[08:03] <arrow> hi all
[08:03] <PriceChild> gop: what's wrong with it?
[08:03] <enyc> gop: also there is 'explore2fs' but that does not 'mount' the filesystem
[08:03] <thespore> PriceChild, I don't have a screensaver item in the preferences menu :S
[08:03] <gop> what should I type in google enyc
[08:03] <Jumper> nope  /media is (empty)
[08:03] <gop> enyc oh
[08:03] <enyc> gop: not sure ;-)
[08:03] <klick> no error message is returned i figure im typing something wrong
[08:03] <PriceChild> thespore: using gnome?
[08:03] <thespore> PriceChild, yes
[08:03] <gop> PriceChild well, it won't mount my ext3 drive in windows not sure why
[08:03] <nolimitsoya> Jumper, did you boot the live dvd? then you need to mount manualy
[08:04] <thespore> PriceChild, on dapper
[08:04] <PriceChild> thespore: run gnome-screensaver-preferences
[08:04] <Jumper> ok, that is the answer I needed  stupid me expected them to be mounted
[08:04] <php-freak> okay one more question, how do I change my current folder where the wget is going to download the files to?
[08:04] <PriceChild> thespore: oh dapper... should still be the same command, but i'm probably being silly and its different
[08:04] <thespore> PriceChild, command not found
[08:04] <nolimitsoya> php-freak, itll download wherever you are at the moment
[08:04] <PriceChild> thespore: actually yeah it'll be different... they used xscreensaver in dapper
[08:04] <nolimitsoya> php-freak, just cd to another cd
[08:04] <php-freak> k
[08:04] <php-freak> now whats apt-get mean?
[08:04] <ubun> why does 'system monitor' report megabytes as "MiB" there's no 'i' in megabyte, there's no 'i' in team either
[08:05] <Jumper> actually I have used Xandros since version 2, 3 and now ver4  I have looked ober/installed dozen or three diff distro's
[08:05] <PriceChild> thespore: use autocomplete (tab) to do soemthing like xscreensaver-config
[08:05] <nolimitsoya> !apt | php-freak
[08:05] <ubotu> php-freak: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[08:05] <leviathan> somebody can help me to install a wireless card with chip rtl8185l... the ubuntu 6.10 detect and install the modules but when I active the card in System - Administration - Network these be locked
[08:05] <PriceChild> ubun: "Million" maybe?
[08:05] <Jumper> every time I have tried ubuntu, I just plain dislike it.  must be me as it is "popular"
[08:05] <nolimitsoya> ubun, a mibibit is 1000000b
[08:05] <PriceChild> Jumper: then don't use it :)
[08:05] <zylche> ubun, but if there's no 'i' in the team, and 'u' aren't in the team, then no one's on the god damnned team!
[08:05] <php-freak> I see
[08:05] <ubun> well it says KiB too
[08:05] <PriceChild> Jumper: Find the distribution that is right for you :)
[08:06] <Jumper> firured I would install and try and see what inclines people to choose to use it
[08:06] <inmas> k   tal
[08:06] <php-freak> nolimitoysa: now when I use the wget -r (do i put ftp address here with directory)?
[08:06] <fromvega> jrib: the squid process is not being up. I do start it, then after a while it goes off and do not list in the process list!
[08:06] <PriceChild> Jumper: we don't mind as long as you don't tell others its not right for them either without them trying it

[08:07] <thespore> PriceChild, thanks for your help
[08:07] <Jumper> I dislike gnome for sure, but could get used to it

[08:08] <jerp> I just installed a game that says it can't find a file (libstdc++.so.5).  All I find in '/usr/lib' is libstdc++.so.6  Any help would be appreciated.
[08:08] <nolimitsoya> zylche, well, the "problem" is of a logical character. its just not a problem, but a "problem"
[08:08] <PriceChild> gop: I don't know really sorry

[08:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about libstdc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:09] <PriceChild> !libstdc++
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> gop, have you mounted them? theres an ext2 controller in the control panel after installation
[08:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about libstdc++ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:09] <Jumper> difficult to judge without an install and use a few days... now I know my other "files" in whichever drive or partition" will be avaible, maybe I will try it
[08:09] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya: he left
[08:09] <ubun> google says mibibit is supposed to be spelled mebibit btw
[08:09] <PriceChild> jerp: just looking for you
[08:09] <jerp> thanks :)
[08:10] <nolimitsoya> ubun, might very well be. :) i find the whole thing quite silly to be honest, so ive never used the term
[08:10] <ubun> yeah
[08:11] <PriceChild> Jerp: hmm... before i search for you... maybe try copying the file to the same location but with the 5 instead? :P
[08:11] <jerp> I've got libstdc++5 in the synaptic but no ~c++.so.5
[08:11] <PriceChild> jerp: if it doesn't work, then just delete the file and we'll try something else
[08:11] <sid> I have a Windows XP machine for a teacher from my University...it's got an 80 gig hdd that is used by a windows partition(brand new machine). Is it easy to put Ubuntu on this machine?
[08:11] <nolimitsoya> sid, yes
[08:11] <ubun> extremely
[08:12] <PriceChild> sid: you can even just run off of the cd drive to test it out first
[08:12] <PriceChild> sid: won't change your harddrive
[08:12] <sid> PriceChild: right, I understand I can use it as a livecd. PriceChild but I have the windows admin here, and he does like 20 windows machines a day. And he claims nothing will resize the NTFS partition properly and it will be messed up.
[08:12] <ubun> ah the entire 80gb is used by XP? guess you gotta resize the partitions with partition magic or fips or something ive done, but should still be easy
[08:13] <sid> PriceChild: Will the NTFS work properly or have any problems?
[08:13] <jerp> PriceChild, change the name during the copy/move?
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> sid, in theory itll work, but have a backup
[08:13] <PriceChild> sid: You can read, but not write to ntfs safelt
[08:13] <PriceChild> *safely
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> PriceChild, thats not what he asked ;)
[08:13] <PriceChild> sid: you can write to ntfs... but back everything up and don't blame me if you experience data loss
[08:13] <sid> PriceChild: So what is Ubuntu going to do? Use parted to resize it?
[08:13] <sid> (edgy I'm talking about)
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> sid, yes
[08:13] <PriceChild> sid: I have bad experiences with resizing ntfs
[08:14] <PriceChild> sid: if you do resize... then defrag it first
[08:14] <PriceChild> hey Joe_CoT
[08:14] <PriceChild> jerp: yeah
[08:14] <sid> So will I be able to pop in an edgy disc, and it will take the 80 gig partition and make it 70 gigs say?
[08:14] <PriceChild> sid: yes
[08:14] <Joe_CoT> pricechild: hey, hows it goin
[08:14] <nolimitsoya> sid, yes, but have a backup
[08:14] <sid> k
[08:14] <PriceChild> Joe_CoT: average
[08:14] <jerp> ok, I'll give it a try,
[08:15] <JuJuBee> I need to perform a password recovery on a cisco router.  My connection to the router comes through an access server.  I am using terminal to telnet to the AS and then jump on a console line to the router.  I cannot seem to get the boot process to break.  What is the break key for terminal?
[08:15] <Joe_CoT> Pricechild: haha, isn't it always. I'm at work right now, so mostly just idling in my loco channel, but i'll be on later. much later
[08:15] <PriceChild> Joe_CoT: have fun
[08:15] <ubun> if he's the admin tell him to use the livecd to decide he wants to install ubuntu, t hen try it with a partition resizer on ONE backed up computer, if it works great if not then reinstall windows on it as a dual-boot ubuntu+XP machine, use that for a while decide if you want JUST ubuntu or all machines to be ubuntu+XP. if so then im sure he has norton 'ghost' which will help automate the process right :)
[08:16] <ubun> in the end it will be worth it anyway :/
[08:16] <ubun> as opposed to hefty vista upgrade fees or whatever :p

[08:23] <optikalmouse> BitTorrent
[08:23] <optikalmouse> that's a good client

[08:24] <zezu> partition type id 83 is ext2 ?
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> zezu, no
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> zezu, ext is afilesystem, not a partition type
[08:25] <ver0niqu3> optikalmouse, have more torrents file in the same window
[08:25] <zezu> err
[08:25] <zezu> right
[08:25] <optikalmouse> ver0niqu3: yes i think it can
[08:25] <ver0niqu3> and like azureus when i open the program i get all my torrents there
[08:26] <ver0niqu3> not open all torrents every time i close bittorrent
[08:26] <nolimitsoya> ver0niqu3, check out transmission or install wine to run torrent

[08:26] <leviathan> ok
[08:26] <Jumper>  ext3 I think

[08:27] <optikalmouse> ver0niqu3: i was downloading 3+ torrents at once a month ago in the bt client
[08:28] <zezu> then wrote it back to another drive
[08:28] <zezu> fdisk reads it like it read the first
[08:28] <zezu> ( i didn't know if dd would copy  the part table and MBR )
[08:28] <proty> hello, can someone explain me what mens " a switchboard error" on GAin or aMsn?
[08:28] <zezu> so the data is there, and it seems it has the part. table at least
[08:28] <zezu> or else fdisk wouldn't list it
[08:29] <zezu> if i just use mount without a fs type, it tells me i need to specify a fs type
[08:29] <nolimitsoya> zezu, try 'sudo mount -t auto /dev/<device> /<path>
[08:29] <zezu> ok
[08:29] <optikalmouse> ver0niqu3: if you download the client from the website it's fine. for some reason the version i have has NO GUI :/
[08:30] <zezu> mount: you must specify the filesystem type
[08:30] <nolimitsoya> zezu, use gparted the check what filesystem it is
[08:30] <atarinox> ubotu: i don't see anything about alsa...i'm using xfce though...maybe that's different?

[08:31] <PriceChild> jerp: Im' back sorry
[08:31] <jerp> pricechild, I got a couple replies when I tried to enter the initiating command to run the game....
[08:31] <jerp> pricechild, reply1_  ./ut2004-bin: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5: version `GLIBCPP_3.2' not found (required by ./ut2004-bin)

[08:33] <nolimitsoya> zezu, then things did gowell :)
[08:33] <PriceChild> ubun: Its a "proper" 3d desktop isn't it :)
[08:33] <zezu> ;)
[08:33] <nolimitsoya> *didnt
[08:33] <zezu> let me see if the original disc has the same result
[08:33] <PriceChild> ubun: before i used linux, its what i imagined vista would look like
[08:33] <zezu> perhaps its a custom fs
[08:33] <PriceChild> ubun: especially with the new "3d world" plugin
[08:34] <ubun> i wanna try it but im not sure how i'd fare on my ati 64mb card
[08:34] <nolimitsoya> ubun, should be fine

[08:37] <HeavyAl> too much to post here
[08:37] <Thialfihar> How can I set it up so many applications can produce sound at the same time? I'm on Edgy and got some Intel audio chipset.
[08:37] <freddy> hey guys, main repository for wine is down! http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/dists/edgy/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz
[08:37] <HeavyAl> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1856771#post1856771
[08:37] <Thialfihar> And sound works fine as long as it is only one application using it.

[08:40] <da1andonly83> hi i am new to ubuntu and i dont know why but on installation the screen has hundreds of lines across and u cant read the image, there like four mouses but the picture is fine when the welcome screen comes on. I have tried it in safe graphics mode as well ????
[08:40] <nemesis4u> can someone help me - I have looked all over the web for this answer
[08:41] <trappist> da1andonly83: the only solution I know for that is to disable the splash altogether - it would be great if you could take a picture of it and file a bug (if there's not already a bug)
[08:41] <Ash-Fox> Hmm, what's with the X updates? I can't find them in USN? Is there some other mailing lsit I can subscribe to to find out update information?
[08:42] <trappist> Ash-Fox: from the changelog, it looks like it's just some dependency fixes
[08:42] <da1andonly83> how do u disable the flash?
[08:42] <da1andonly83> i mean splash
[08:42] <nemesis4u> Could anyone help me - I am trying to Rar a video 900meg into 50 meg rar files.... how? and is there a gui to do it as well?

[08:42] <Ash-Fox> trappist, happen to know of any mailing list that will notify me in future about these updates?
[08:42] <StephenL> da1andonly83:  I had the same problem when I was installing ubuntu edgy on my mother's computer.
[08:43] <julianx> jaak_ i didn't know
[08:43] <trappist> Ash-Fox: not that I know of, unfortunately
[08:44] <zezu> nolimitsoya, no, this is for an arcade game, and like i said, the original disk has the same troubles
[08:44] <zezu> the original disk still works in the system
[08:44] <tonyyarusso> Ash-Fox: dapper-changes, edgy-changes, and feisty-changes have some info
[08:44] <zezu> the backup does not, but it doesn't even detect the hdd

[09:09] <walterwoj> Hello all!
[09:09] <tux---> how can i install frozen bubble
[09:09] <jughead> hi walterwoj
[09:09] <julianx> yes it is possible ... when  are-you  update the package list??
[09:09] <julianx> oups i'm sorry for my English
[09:10] <walterwoj> I am looking for advice on which version of Ubuntu to use: the server or the desktop version...
[09:11] <jrib> walterwoj: do you plan on using it as a server or desktop? :P
[09:11] <lkusmir> Hardware detection problem: I got a usb nic card (noname) and would like to use it under ubuntu 6.10. No success atm... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35814/ any hints?
[09:11] <thejapa> walterwoj: choose the appropriate for your uses. the names are exactly what they mean.
[09:11] <walterwoj> I am a web programmer and only slightly more than a noob.  I need LAMP but i plan to use it for testing on my laptop where i develope.
[09:11] <Frederick> folks does anyone here speaks portuguese? I couldn`t manage to add cedilha and acentos in my ubuntu
[09:12] <thejapa> Frederick: yes, I can talk ptBR but not on this channel
[09:12] <sivik> how do you force all packages to be upgraded when one does apt-get upgrade
[09:12] <tonyyarusso> walterwoj: !lamp will tell you how to get it all on a desktop install
[09:12] <sivik> !lamp
[09:12] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[09:12] <thejapa> sivik: you mean sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[09:12] <jrib> Frederick: in keyboard preferences, you have to setup a dead key
[09:12] <sivik> thejapa, no, i mean when i am upgrading packages, not the who dist
[09:13] <jrib> Frederick: it's called "compose key" in the preferences
[09:13] <kitche> sivik: dist-upgrade does update all your packages
[09:13] <sivik> kitche, so upgrade doesn't?
[09:13] <thejapa> Frederick: which keyboard you have? abnt-2?
[09:13] <Frederick> jrib: I can use a combo the problm is that even the combo does not work
[09:13] <Frederick> thejapa: american
[09:13] <kitche> sivik: don't know I always used dist-upgrade
[09:14] <Doow> !pt | Frederick
[09:14] <ubotu> Frederick: Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[09:14] <thejapa> Frederick: use alternate US
[09:14] <sivik> even when i do dist-upgrade, it says: The following packages have been kept back:
[09:14] <Doow> dunno if that's still needed, but just as an additional tip =)
[09:14] <kitche> sivik: and what are they?
[09:14] <gizmo_the_great1> hi. I have just installed a Windows application into Wine. It's an app that, under Windows, requires a reboot to finish the installation. How do I achieve the same thing with Wine, because at the moment, when I try to run the app it just says' Module not Found!"
[09:14] <sivik> kitche, a whole list of crap
[09:14] <walterwoj> Ok, I just am not sure i could configure it all manually.....
[09:15] <fbc> HELP! What do I have to do to get 6.06LT to install on my SATA driven laptop? It gives me HDA errors.. Is there a special switch during installation?
[09:15] <Frederick> thejapa: it worked
[09:15] <thejapa> Frederick: hehe, i got tricked into the us international too
[09:16] <benny99> hello, what to do, if I get FPS Breakdowns after running opengl applications for a certain time? I'm using fglrx + Radeon and getting sometimes the following warning in dmesg : [17180053.292000]  [fglrx:firegl_rmmap]  *ERROR* map 0xf73e3650 still in use (map_count=1)
[09:16] <pentadrago> hi
[09:16] <sivik> benny99, ati + linux = crap
[09:16] <crackcorn> where can i find the error logs for samba, im trying to start it and it just says starting samba daemons [fail] 
[09:17] <benny99> sivik: definetly -.-'
[09:17] <sivik> crackcorn, try running the command from terminal/konsole/xterm and it should output some errors there
[09:17] <crackcorn> thats where i am
[09:17] <sivik> does it have a error number?
[09:17] <crackcorn> no
[09:17] <benny99> sivik: definitely
[09:17] <gizmo_the_great1> hi. I have just installed a Windows application into Wine. It's an app that, under Windows, requires a reboot to finish the installation. How do I achieve the same effect (simulate a reboot) with Wine, because at the moment, when I try to run the app it just says' Module not Found!"
[09:17] <sivik> gizmo_the_great1, try the winehq channel
[09:17] <kitche> crackcorn: check dmesg or your other logs in /var/log
[09:17] <pentadrago> does anyone in here use cinelerra on edgy (preferably compiled from subversion) ?
[09:17] <crackcorn> k sec
[09:18] <kmaynard> crackcorn, look in /var/log/samba
[09:18] <gizmo_the_great1> sivik: ok - good idea
[09:18] <benny99> sivik: no, just [17180053.292000]  [fglrx:firegl_rmmap]  *ERROR* map 0xf73e3650 still in use (map_count=1)
[09:18] <cpk1> gizmo_the_great1: usually winehq.org has installation instructions
[09:18] <benny99> sivik: that really sucks ... if the whole texture-space is used, the fps break down to 0.5 ....
[09:19] <sivik> benny99, sorry that was aimed at crockcorn
[09:19] <sivik> benny99, about the error number
[09:19] <benny99> sivik: Doesnt matter, I'm happy, that somebody is talking wiht me :)
[09:19] <benny99> sivik: *_* sorry, that you are hearing my complaining ...
[09:19] <sivik> benny99, thats cool
[09:20] <sivik> benny99, what kind of ati card is it?
[09:20] <benny99> sivik: special 9600 Model (9600TX (NON XT!))
[09:20] <sivik> benny99, not sure, i have a 200m xpress and it has never worked
[09:20] <benny99> sivik: it uses the radeon 9500 GPU, but 9600 VRAM o_o
[09:21] <sivik> benny99, thats interesting
[09:21] <bora> hi ever oe

[09:21] <benny99> sivik. I think ATI said: That card is older than 2 years now... why don't we stop supporting it at all :)
[09:22] <HeavyAl> How would I go about reinstalling the original wireless drivers that came with Edgy?
[09:22] <sivik> benny99, it will be nice when amd gets hold of those because they said they would open source and support all the ati cards
[09:22] <julianx> I'm seeking  after a good channel for speak  English... who can help me?
[09:22] <bora> I need help install xmms code in the console
[09:22] <sivik> julianx, whats your problem
[09:22] <benny99> sivik: would be great...
[09:22] <kitche> bora what's wrong exactly? you compiling xmms from source?
[09:22] <sivik> benny99, very much so
[09:22] <bora> yeap kitche
[09:22] <benny99> sivik: cause I really love ubuntu... linux at all, everything! is working faster ... except my graca... it sucks like hell -.-
[09:22] <kitche> bora: why not just use the binary package?
[09:23] <bora> I cant install xmms
[09:23] <savvas> there's a new version of gnome desktop?
[09:23] <sivik> benny99, is it on a laptop or desktop?
[09:23] <benny99> sivik: sorry for the s-words, but I'm really mad about this ...
[09:23] <sivik> benny99, thats cool
[09:23] <benny99> sivik: Desktop
[09:23] <bora> how can I do
[09:23] <sivik> benny99, go buy a decent nvidia card, they work great
[09:23] <kitche> savvas: 2.16 been out for a while
[09:23] <benny99> sivik: Yep... and I would also be able to use a TV-Out then
[09:24] <sivik> kitche, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35815/, thats the stuff that is added when i'm trying to upgrade the packages
[09:24] <kitche> bora: sudo apt-get install xmms should install it or go though synaptic or aptitude
[09:24] <julianx> i'm very bad for speak and write in english... i  seek for change that
[09:24] <HeavyAl> Ok, how about WHERE can I find the wireless drivers that Edgy originally installs?
[09:24] <sivik> benny99, as long as you buy a card (nvidia) that has tv out
[09:24] <kitche> sivik: ah the python packages thought so
[09:24] <bora> ok thank you I will try it ok
[09:24] <julianx> i'm very bad for speak and write in english... i  seek to change that
[09:24] <sivik> kitche, so?
[09:24] <HeavyAl> That is, where in the repos?
[09:24] <benny99> sivik: that's also great... My standard TV-Out gives me 2-color-output and my Composite is extremely sensitive ...
[09:24] <sivik> benny99, lol
[09:24] <kitche> sivik: there is a fix on ubuntu's website/forums I believe for it
[09:24] <sivik> kitche, ok
[09:24] <savvas> kitche: i just tried update and upgrade and asked me to update xorg and x11-common and several others
[09:25] <benny99> sivik: so, although I've got 2 TV-Outs, I can't really use my tv -.-'
[09:25] <sivik> kitche, well, for a while, it was a bunch of the openoffice stuff
[09:25] <bora> thank you too much I am very peasesure
[09:25] <bora> kitche
[09:26] <kitche> savvas: what version of ubuntu do you have?
[09:26] <savvas> kitche: 6.10 and sources with multiverse/universe stable
[09:26] <katasuka> hello
[09:26] <benny99> sivik: thanks at all for listening to me
[09:27] <benny99> sivik: I'll never buy an ATI-Card again ...
[09:27] <savvas> kitche: it looks like it's 2.16.1
[09:27] <kitche> savvas: yeah probably just a patch version of 2.16
[09:27] <sivik> benny99, well, if amd fixes them, it may be better cards, we will just have to wait and see, since amd is going to start putting their cpus as gpus on the ati video cards
[09:27] <savvas> ah goody, been expecting that :) i was just asking for safety reasons :P
[09:28] <benny99> sivik: I hope they'll fix it...
[09:28] <benny99> sivik: still that tv-out problem -.-'...
[09:28] <katasuka> does anyone know how to disable gaim from showing when someone enters or leaves an irc chan?
[09:28] <SidSilver4> does anyone know how to set the language for a specific user?
[09:28] <benny99> sivik: what ever... thanks for being my alienist ^_^
[09:28] <kitche> savvas: I checked gnome website and it's still at 2.16 didn't really see if they released a patch version but that's probably what it is
[09:29] <bora> thnak you so much about that firends see you again byebye Iam going out
[09:29] <bora>  bye
[09:32] <reverie> hey guys
[09:32] <reverie> *tips hat*
[09:32] <reverie> can anyone advice me on a fresh install of edgy?
[09:33] <reverie> i have windows on sda1, i'm installing ubuntu on sdb1
[09:33] <reverie> i assume, when it wants to install grub on hd0 that will overrite my xp mbr
[09:33] <reverie> so should i rather use hd1 ?
[09:34] <huibert> reverie: you cab boot win xp from grub
[09:34] <reverie> yeah but i don't wanna touch the xp drive
[09:34] <kitche> reverie: think it should be sd1 but windows keeps all boot files in C:\windows
[09:34] <reverie> 'd rather tell the bios to boot off the second drive
[09:34] <huibert> reverie: that should work too
[09:35] <reverie> so hd1 := sdb ?
[09:35] <kitche> reverie: I don't use SATA drives but think grub calls them sd instead of hd
[09:35] <huibert> that depends on your bios
[09:35] <savvas> reverie: does your motherboard support choosing hard disk boot order? i.e. pressing F11 and choosing from which hard disk to boot?
[09:35] <huibert> kitche: yes, sata drives are "scsi" drives
[09:35] <reverie> yeah
[09:35] <eilker>  i am gonna have  a dedicated server for my web sites, thinking of installing ubuntu-server, but i dont know how to manage it, because there will be no gui, scare of it...
[09:35] <kitche> but it depends if you have PATA support enabled or not reverie if you call it hd or sd
[09:36] <reverie> hmz
[09:36] <reverie> at the moment my primary sata drive is the xp disk
[09:36] <kitche> huibert: I know what sata drives are just not sure how to set grub up on them exactly, and not sure what he hs enabled in his bios
[09:36] <Atlas95> hi
[09:36] <reverie> i'm new to sata in linux
[09:36] <Atlas95> what is the name of program which alt+F2 launch please?
[09:36] <savvas> reverie: here's what i did.. i removed the sata drive of windows xp, installed ubuntu on the other sata drive, all worked well. then reconnected the xp drive, and simply press F11 to choose if i want it to boot from the drive containing xp, or the other drive containing ubuntu
[09:37] <Atlas95> sory for my english :p
[09:37] <Atlas95> do you understand me?
[09:37] <reverie> that's what i usually do
[09:37] <reverie> Atlas95: loud and clear :D
[09:37] <savvas> well it's the easiest way how you wouldn't touch the mbr of the xp drive
[09:37] <reverie> well i'm gonna try hd1 isntead of hd0 (default)
[09:37] <reverie> i can always repair the mbr
[09:38] <tommyw> is there an idiot's guide for getting ubuntu to authenticate with a windows AD server?  I'm in a corporate environ and am having problems setting up printers because I dont have the ability to log onto the individual machines
[09:38] <julianx> you can always save the mbr

[09:40] <basix> hi... is there anybody successfully running Debian with Intel DG965RY motherboards ( For Core 2 Duo processors ). I've seen many complaining about the Linux compatibility of this board. I wont buy it if it doesnt run Linux! :P
[09:41] <reverie> btw
[09:41] <reverie> anyone know if nvidia support the 8800gtx in linux yet?
[09:41] <savvas> basix: wrong channel, try #debian :) i'd ask the shop assistant/technician if i were you though
=== debzzz is now known as g0t2h6j6h

[09:41] <basix> savvas, they dont know a thing about Linux compatibility! :P
[09:41] <basix> savvas, i did...no replies :(
[09:42] <savvas> let's see what i can find
[09:42] <dogmeat> can i create an iso from an smbmounted cdrom?
[09:43] <PgR> Is this the place to ask an Xorg on ubuntu problem question? (Sorry, never used IRC before)
[09:43] <nolimitsoya> PgR, yes
[09:43] <tommyw> is there an idiot's guide for getting ubuntu to authenticate with a windows AD server? I'm having some problems following the articles that I am finding in the forums.
[09:44] <findlay> yea, 1000 nicks
[09:44] <findlay> what package provides xorgcfg?
[09:44] <apokryphos> !packages
[09:44] <ubotu> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[09:44] <reverie> lots of pplz here tonight eh
[09:45] <reverie> it took like 1min for irssi to scroll the list of users
[09:45] <reverie> because im using xorg in vesa!
[09:45] <reverie> sloooow
[09:45] <apokryphos> heh
[09:45] <kmu> How do I use apt-get to determine the version of a software package that I installed with it?
[09:45] <findlay> I know how to look for packages, but how do you find out what package provides a file?
[09:45] <eilker> hi,,, i am gonna have  a dedicated server for my web sites, thinking of installing ubuntu-server, but i dont know how to manage it, because there will be no gui, scare of it...any experience with no gui envoriment ?
[09:45] <findlay> kmu: `dpkg -L <package>`
[09:45] <jamesbrose> Getting this error when trying to restore with the Live CD - http://i17.tinypic.com/4d1r51c.png -- Please help!
[09:45] <nolimitsoya> PgR, what was your question then?
[09:45] <crimsun> findlay: http://packages.ubuntu.com or apt-file
[09:46] <PgR> Excellent. Running 6.10 on AMD64 (Orleans, 2200) nvidia card. Xorg runs up to 85% - particularly when scrolling/loading graphics in firefox - but just highlighting area of desktop will do it. Tried the MOZ_DISABLE_pango thing, but no use.... been at this for 3 days now... :(
[09:46] <huibert> eilker: if it's not working "in the shell" you could install xlibs and gui programms, and ron these using ssh and X forwarding.
[09:46] <nolimitsoya> PgR, what driver are you using?
[09:47] <savvas> basix: it looks like gentoo has support, but i guess ubuntu/debian might do too. here's a guide i found searching in google: http://www.oakcourt.dyndns.org/~andrew/wiki/index.php/DebianOnIntel965
[09:47] <findlay> kmu: sorry, that's not quite it.  You can try `dpkg -l | grep -i package`
[09:47] <jamesbrose> Nobody? - http://i17.tinypic.com/4d1r51c.png
[09:47] <PgR> nolimitsoya: nv
[09:47] <kmu> findlay, thanks
[09:47] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, fsck?
[09:48] <jamesbrose> sorry?
[09:48] <reverie> okay, Marvin is done installing.. let's do the reboot and prey ritual...
[09:48] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, have you done an fsck on the filesystem? might be its corrupt
[09:48] <benny99> sivik: wrote them an email... good night :)
[09:49] <jamesbrose> nolimitsoya> its fine
[09:49] <huibert> jamesbrose: are you sure you are restoring, it looks more like reinstalling
[09:49] <rubix_> isn't there a multiple server script for xchat
[09:49] <jamesbrose> yeah
[09:50] <nolimitsoya> rubix_, to do what?
[09:50] <jamesbrose> im trying to reinstallt the system but keep all my files in /home
[09:50] <jamesbrose> that is located in the hdd1 filesystem
[09:50] <rubix_> connect to multiple servers...
[09:50] <ubuntu_> opa1...
[09:50] <huibert> jamesbrose: what if you tick the "format" options ?
[09:50] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, that would be done with a backup and reformat. having /home on a separate partition is always a good idea, for that very reason
=== asdasd is now known as Nestor
[09:51] <[gen2] niki> how can i test feisty? iam used to bloody edge software because i previously used gentoo
[09:51] <[gen2] niki> that would be no problem for me
[09:51] <huibert> jamesbrose: then thats the problem I think
[09:51] <jamesbrose> nolimitsoya  basically ive screwed up alot of things and i need to keep my /home/username direcorty and reinstall the rest
[09:51] <findlay> packages.ubuntu.org gave me: 0 results of about 725 pages. (0.27 seconds).  Can someone who has xorgcfg installed tell me what package it's in?
[09:51] <jamesbrose> if you get me?
[09:51] <nolimitsoya> rubix_, xchat can connect to multiple servers by default
[09:51] <savvas> !feisty
[09:51] <ubotu> The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is pre-alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule - Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty - Help in #ubuntu+1
[09:51] <Nestor> hi
[09:51] <savvas> hmm
[09:51] <jamesbrose> So, what do you think I should do?
[09:51] <huibert> jamesbrose: the installer need a clean partition to install, you should not use hdb1 as fs_root if you HOME is located there
[09:52] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, as i said, youll have to back up your /home, and reformat. always keep /home on a separate partition toavoid that in the future
[09:52] <ailean> has anyone here taken lpi exams?
[09:52] <huibert> nolimitsoya: is absolutly correct
[09:52] <jamesbrose> can't i just get the installed to overwrite the files?
[09:52] <PgR> nolimitsoya: I've found a linux driver on nvidia's site - I'll give that a try. Thanks for the hint!
[09:52] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, no, dont do that
[09:53] <jamesbrose> Why not?
[09:53] <nolimitsoya> PgR, dont. use nvidia-glx from the repos
[09:53] <huibert> jamesbrose: thats what "format" would do, but then your home dir will be lost
[09:53] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, couse its likely to leave a mess
[09:53] <jamesbrose> Hmm
[09:53] <jamesbrose> ok then
[09:53] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, backup, and do over, do right :)
[09:53] <jamesbrose> so i want to backup the home
[09:53] <jamesbrose> then format, then put it back in
[09:53] <jamesbrose> ?
[09:53] <nolimitsoya> jamesbrose, yes
[09:54] <PgR> nolimitsoya: Err, OK... Is that the same as NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-1.0-8776-pkg2.run on the nvidia.com site?
[09:54] <savvas> [gen2] niki: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=305870
[09:55] <quiet> where does one set up the consolefont??
[09:55] <nolimitsoya> PgR, probably not the most recent version, but itll save you loads of hazzle
[09:55] <findlay> crimsun: it looks like packages.ubunut.com is just about the same as `apt-cache search` and I'm guessing apt-file only searches installed packages.  So I still don't know how to find out what package provides /usr/bin/xorgcfg
[09:55] <PgR> nolimitsoya: thanks.
[09:56] <crimsun> apt-file is local packages.ubuntu.com
[09:56] <bluefox83> findlay, apt-cache show <package>
[09:56] <gemby> join #ubuntu/hr
[09:56] <bluefox83> or apt-cache search
[09:56] <gemby> join #ubuntu-hr
[09:56] <findlay> bluefox83: except that I don't know the package name I'm looking for (-:
[09:57] <bluefox83> findlay, that's what apt-cache show is for :p

I have a WinXP box which I connect using a crossover cable to my internal network card (the external one has the internet) and I want to share my PC's internet (Ubuntu box) with the WinXP box. Is this possible? I installed bridge-utils but I don't know what to do next :(
[09:57] <bluefox83> eh..i dunno i don't remember how to do it either..
[09:58] <crimsun> findlay: that's because no package provides it.
[09:58] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, you dont want bridges, but a nat. get firestarter.
[09:58] <DARKGuy> findlay: apt-cache search xorg | grep 'config' ?
[09:58] <findlay> crimsun: how do you know?

[10:00] <inima> i got a ATI
[10:00] <nolimitsoya> !fglrx
[10:00] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:00] <findlay> hmmm: /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: xserver-xorg is broken or not fully installed

[10:01] <ubotu> Dima: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[10:01] <w3ccv> Dima, Ubuntu is one of many Linux distributions, Red Hat, Fedora Core, Slackware are othere to name only a few
[10:01] <Btd> opera just stopped working and maxes out the cpu meter with IOwait, could this be a problem with opera since the entire rest of the system seems fine, or is my disk about to blow?

[10:01] <Dima> Okay cool, also I just burned ubunto iso image to a disk..what do I do now? Do I have to remove windows XP first and then install ubuntu?
[10:02] <Pie-rate> Dima: Ubuntu is a distribution of linux. It is essentially linux with a set of applications and a package downloader utility. Linux is basically just the core
[10:02] <SinnerG> how do I add a mount @ fstab @ edgy? where do I get this 'uuid' ?
[10:02] <Dima> Oh
[10:02] <findlay> Dima: no, noce you load the livecd it will all you to resize and repartition your hard drive
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> Dima, just reboot you computer, and youll end up in a live environment. your hdd wont be touched untill you choose to install. if/when you do, ask here for helpwith resizeing tips.
[10:02] <Dima> Okay thanks
[10:02] <bluefox83> Dima, just pop the cd in and reboot, make sure your bios is set to boot from cdrom
[10:03] <Dima> Okay thanks I will do that now. I appreciate your help guys
[10:03] <findlay> Dima: boilerplate YMMV, of course (:
[10:03] <bluefox83> mhmm
[10:03] <Pie-rate> Dima: you can resize the windows partition and install ubuntu on a new partition, then you will be able to select an OS from a list on boot
[10:03] <bluefox83> or trash winblows completely :P
[10:03] <Pie-rate> yep
[10:03] <Pie-rate> that's the best solution
[10:03] <nolimitsoya> Dima, have a backup
[10:03] <Dima> Okay i got the ubuntu screen. Do i press Start or Install ubuntu
[10:03] <Pie-rate> Dima: yes, definitely back everything necessary up
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> Dima, yes
[10:04] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: Okay, I'm in a wizard window now and I pressed next
[10:04] <Dima> well i just reformated my other comp
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, just follow it through. it should help you with sharing
[10:04] <Dima> so i really have nothing to back up
[10:04] <bluefox83> Dima, start
[10:04] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: Okay I'll try, brb

[10:05] <SinnerG> Anyone who can help me? :/
[10:05] <Dima> Why do people choose linux over windowsXP
[10:05] <savvas> findlay: did you install apt-file ? or?
[10:05] <nolimitsoya> !helpme | Sinn
[10:05] <ubotu> Sinn: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:05] <Chewy954> could someone help me install Power ISO?
[10:06] <Clarrisa> dima: FREE
[10:06] <SinnerG> I asked it ...
[10:06] <Dima> Oh
[10:06] <Dima> Ya i forgot about that heh
[10:06] <SinnerG> <SinnerG> how do I add a mount @ fstab @ edgy? where do I get this 'uuid' ?
[10:06] <Pie-rate> Dima: freedom, customization
[10:06] <Dima> Does ubuntu take a lot of skill in coding?
[10:06] <nolimitsoya> Dima, couse its free (as in speach and price) and no palladium :)
[10:06] <nolimitsoya> Dima, none at all
[10:06] <CyberT3> hello
[10:06] <diskus> Dima: coding?
[10:06] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: It asks for local area network device, should I select the one with internet or the one which has the crossover cable connected in?
[10:06] <d1gital> quick question here guys if i upgrade to edgy from the package manager, can i go back to dapper if something goes wrong?
[10:06] <Dima> What kind of browser does linux use?
[10:06] <SinnerG> lol ..
[10:06] <diskus> firefox for example
[10:07] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, should be wan network, but not sure. never used it myself :)
[10:07] <SinnerG> yeah, or even opera :p
[10:07] <CyberT3> I need help on how to connect to a wired encrypted network, my friend forced me to switch to linux, but I cant use network anymore. I used to use SecureW2....
[10:07] <nolimitsoya> Dima, any you want it to :)
[10:07] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: it only has eth0, eth1 and st0 oO
[10:07] <LRP> does anyone know how to create and setup a separate boot partition, starting with a clean HD? For purposes of dual-booting ubuntu with xp?
[10:07] <CyberT3> so please help or I'll have to go back :(
[10:07] <Dima> Well all the linux screenshots ive ever seen, its always someone typing in a code
[10:07] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, yes, and which one it wan?
[10:07] <Dima> and im not good with codes
[10:07] <huibert> d1gital: no, just like in real life, you can only move forward
[10:07] <nolimitsoya> Dima, you dont have to be
[10:07] <diskus> Dima: you don't need to code anything
[10:07] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: eth0 is connected to the internet, so I guess it's that one
[10:07] <ubun> dimi ubuntu is like windows, basically, with an optional 'command prompt' like windows, basically
[10:08] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, that would be it :) (wan=wide area network)
[10:08] <Dima> o
[10:08] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: well it said the device couldn't be the same *chooses eth1 then*
[10:08] <ubun> you dont have to learn a programming language to use any linux distro that i know of
[10:08] <DARKGuy> agreed
[10:08] <d1gital> huibert:   thanks...   so would you recommend upgrading?  is there much difference?
[10:08] <ubun> anymore than you'd have to learn visual C++ or .net to use windows
[10:09] <findlay> savvas left
[10:09] <gemby> Sry for drping in, any alsa gurues online? Got problems compilinga new alsa :-(
[10:09] <Chewy954> could someone help me install Power ISO?
[10:09] <CyberT3> I need help on how to connect to a wired encrypted network, my friend forced me to switch to linux, but I cant use network anymore. I used to use SecureW2....
[10:10] <ubun> another forced at gun point linux install :(
=== atlas_ is now known as Atlas95
[10:10] <kiran> hi
[10:10] <kiran> :)
[10:10] <ubun> no means no
[10:10] <bluefox83> he was probably tired of fixing your damn viruses and shit on windows :p
[10:10] <rambo3> damn those linux bullies
[10:10] <nolimitsoya> Dima, what you have seen is not coding, but the terminal. its like the command prompt in windows, and used since its sometimes easier. fex, its easier for us here in the supportchannel tojust pass people lines of text for them to cut and paste, than to blindly guide through multitudes of graphical menus. also, some users prefer to do some task with the terminal, over doing them graphicaly
[10:10] <Chewy954> could someone help me install Power ISO?
[10:10] <Chewy954> pls
[10:10] <huibert> d1gital: "never touch a running system" , but if you want the shiny new stuff (beryl) go for it :-)
[10:10] <bluefox83> wtf is power iso?

[10:11] <Chewy954> i needa burn a .daa
[10:11] <Chewy954> :|
[10:11] <Dima> Okay guys im at step 5 of 6 in install of ubuntu. Its asking me how do you want to partion the disk? I want to completely remove windows XP and install ubuntu what do i press.
[10:11] <ubun> not to be confused with the ozbournes family friendly
[10:11] <bluefox83> oh..right..pardon me
[10:11] <bluefox83> my bad, sorry folks >.>
[10:11] <Dima> Do I press, "Erase entire disk"
[10:11] <Chewy954> ne1 know?
[10:11] <kitche> Dima: yes if you want to get rid of XP
[10:11] <bluefox83> Dima, can if you want to
[10:11] <Dima> Okay cool
[10:11] <kiran> :)
[10:11] <LjL> Dima: i guess so. that *will* remove *all* data there are on the entire drive, though
[10:12] <d1gital> beryl?  to the google cave!
[10:12] <Dima> Ya it doesnt matter
[10:12] <LRP> boot partition help anyone?
[10:12] <nolimitsoya> LRP, ?
[10:12] <nolimitsoya> !ask | LRP
[10:12] <ubotu> LRP: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:12] <ubun> i created a 'ssh' item in nautilus in the left-hand panel but it wont let me remove it, i right clicked on it to bring up a menu and it has the option 'remove' but it's dimmed. any ideas?
[10:12] <rhalff> is it possible to copy /var to say /var.new; umount /var, mv /var.new /var, remotely ? :) I would like to do it, but var is most of the time kinda busy, like always busy.
[10:12] <LRP> I did
[10:12] <LRP> does anyone know how to create and setup a separate boot partition, starting with a clean HD? For purposes of dual-booting ubuntu with xp?
[10:12] <huibert> d1gital: beryl rocks, it impresses the hell out of anybody who comes to visit me :-)
[10:13] <nolimitsoya> LRP, choose manual partitioning when installing
[10:13] <Chewy954> no1 can help?
[10:13] <LRP> what file system do I use so that XP and Ubuntu can read it?
[10:13] <ubun> is beryl more than 'eyecandy' yet
[10:13] <CyberT3> I need help on how to connect to a wired encrypted network, my friend forced me to switch to linux, but I cant use network anymore. I used to use SecureW2.... Please help or I have to go back to windows :(
[10:13] <huibert> ubun: you need to "umount" it i think
[10:13] <bluefox83> LRP, why would you want to sully a perfectly good new HD with XP? gosh >.>
[10:13] <nolimitsoya> LRP, its i good idea to be as specific and stringent as possible when asking for help
[10:13] <LRP> haha
[10:13] <kitche> Chewy954: what is .daa for can't remember the file format name
[10:13] <nolimitsoya> LRP, ext2/3 is preferred for file sharing
[10:13] <Chewy954> not sure
[10:13] <Chewy954> but
[10:14] <Chewy954> i needa burn one of my OS's i have
[10:14] <Chewy954> and its a .daa
[10:14] <LRP> thanks for the tip, I'll try to elaborate more
[10:14] <nolimitsoya> LRP, use ex2ifs from fs-driver.org for windows access to ext2/3
[10:14] <LRP> what about FAT12?
[10:14] <ubun> is there a beryl ubuntu livecd (so i can try it before installing)?
[10:14] <nolimitsoya> LRP, stay away!
[10:14] <Chewy954> its my windows XP cd from dell i needa reisntall it and someone i know uploaded it for me in that format
[10:14] <nolimitsoya> :)
[10:14] <Chewy954> :|
[10:14] <LRP> huh?
[10:14] <hilz_> hi all, is there an opensource project that can run on ubuntu, that does the same as gotomeeting or webex where two clients can connect to the server (ubuntu) and share desktops ?
[10:15] <nolimitsoya> LRP, dont use fat12, ever, for anything :)
[10:15] <Dan_Edin> hi
[10:15] <foo> Where is the grub config?
[10:15] <foo> for ubuntu
[10:15] <strav> hi there, I just updated to edgy (kernel 2.17.x) and I guess there's some energy saving management for the processor or something, nonetheless, it seems from time to time that my computer freeze for a fraction of second and I must say I find this rather unpleasing while working... any suggestion on how to disable this? (perhaps a kernel module I should disable?)
[10:15] <nolimitsoya> LRP, if you realy must use a fat filesystem, use fat16. but dont, use ext3
[10:15] <Agrajag> hilz_: ubuntu comes with vino, which is a VNC server for GNOME
[10:15] <kitche> foo: /boot/grub and it's menu.lst not grub.conf
[10:15] <d1gital> huibert: one last question..  all he screenshots i'm seeing of beryl are using it in gnome.  will i be able to use kde?
[10:15] <nolimitsoya> !grub | foo
[10:15] <ubotu> foo: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:15] <Dan_Edin> how do i install the base build only from the ordinary shipit cds of ubuntu dapper?
[10:15] <DARKGuy_> nolimitsoya: sorry, had to restart internet -_- and it's not working either >.<
[10:15] <hilz_> Agrajag: thanks i will check that out
[10:16] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy_, then you probably configured it backwards :)
[10:16] <huibert> Chewy954: look here: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-open-daa-direct-access-archive-files-under-linux-or-unix-oses/
[10:16] <Chewy954> ok
[10:16] <Chewy954> thx
[10:16] <LRP> oh, okay, I had a friend help me setup a dual boot system before and he used FAT12, now I can't seem to recreate what he did so thats why I asked
[10:16] <kitche> Chewy954, it seems like it's for MaC OSX
[10:16] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy_, still, if you want a router, get an ancient computer from a dumpster and install ipcop
[10:16] <DARKGuy_> nolimitsoya: I can't
[10:16] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy_, cant what?
[10:16] <DARKGuy_> nolimitsoya: get another comp
[10:16] <Cubed> hey guys let me get this straight... the deb is all i need to install ndiswrapper to get my internet going?
[10:16] <Dan_Edin> how do i install the base build only from the ordinary shipit cds of ubuntu dapper?
[10:16] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy_, then dont ;)
[10:17] <huibert> Chewy954: be carefull about people telling you to download random stuff of the net :-)
[10:17] <LRP> nolimitsoya, when I tried it with FAT16 i got the warning that FAT16 is not a known linux file system
[10:17] <DARKGuy_> nolimitsoya: How can I solve the problem then? :P
[10:17] <Chewy954> lol
[10:17] <kitche> LRP: it's vfat
[10:17] <nolimitsoya> LRP, use gparted
[10:17] <strav> any suggestion?
[10:17] <Chewy954> i know huibert
[10:17] <LRP> i did
[10:17] <Cubed> what are dependencies????????......does that include the linux kernel?
[10:17] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy_, reconfigure the nat you just duilt, the other way
[10:17] <LRP> kitche, vfat, okay, I've heard of that before too
[10:17] <d1gital> cubed: dependancies are programs other programs depend on to run
[10:17] <DARKGuy_> nolimitsoya: I did, but nothing happens in the XP box when I make it repair the connection
[10:17] <Cubed> anyone here wanna help a noob?
[10:17] <joga> Cubed for ndiswrapper you also need the windows drivers for your hardware
[10:18] <chable> hi
[10:18] <DARKGuy_> nolimitsoya: do I have to put any special IP somewhere?
[10:18] <maxsoftX_> hi all. I've problem a wlan. someone like enter in my pc ?
[10:18] <LRP> kitche, my friend suggested that too but told me he used FAT12 instead, okay, now I can move forward
[10:18] <Cubed> hey joga
[10:18] <nolimitsoya> LRP, still, dont use fat. i fragments like crazy, you cant have bigger files than 4gb, it insecure, its slow, doesent support permissions and is just downright crappy :P
[10:18] <LRP> kitche, so I create that with mkfs right?
[10:18] <beerman> Cubed, apt-get =)
[10:18] <Cubed> i got the inf for my wireless card
[10:18] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy_, no
[10:18] <Cubed> i just can't figure out how to install it
[10:18] <kitche> LRP: vfat is what linux calls any Fat filesystem
[10:18] <Cubed> if i don't have the deb........ then it's a pain in the ass to install?
[10:18] <maxsoftX_> cubed only fr curiosity... wich wlan card? model
[10:18] <strav> really, this power management or something is getting on my nerve
[10:19] <LRP> but for a 15MB partition, is fragmenting a worry
[10:19] <LRP> kitche, oh, I see
[10:19] <beerman> find a mirror
[10:19] <d1gital> cubed: there are countless tutorials on ndiswrapper.  have you searched the ubuntu forums/wiki?
[10:19] <krzych> hello
[10:19] <nolimitsoya> LRP, thats the least of fats problems... its just a crappy filesystem. use ext2/3
[10:19] <LRP> sorry guys, I'm really new at this
[10:19] <Cubed> max: ma111 wireless card via usb
[10:19] <Dan_Edin> nolimitsoya ext is kinda crappy too. xfs is interesting though
[10:19] <krzych> what you talking about?
[10:20] <Cubed> i have searched the forums digital, just dead ends.... i don't know how to compile some shit
[10:20] <krzych> :P:P
[10:20] <nolimitsoya> LRP, look, just use your /home partition, and mount with ext2ifs from fs-driver.org
[10:20] <krzych> are you talking about ubuntu?
[10:20] <nolimitsoya> Dan_Edin, i know. im running jfs and xfs myself :)
[10:20] <krzych> ok can some body tell my what is this
[10:21] <nolimitsoya> Dan_Edin, actualy, jfs is quite a bit better than xfs, apart from not having a defragmentation tool, wich you might not need anyway :)
[10:21] <krzych> oo
[10:21] <krzych> cool
[10:21] <strav> anyone encountered the same hangs I'm talkin about in kernel 2.17?
[10:21] <krzych> ok i'm go sleep
[10:21] <huibert> warning, filessystem war in progress
[10:21] <nolimitsoya> huibert, :P
[10:21] <d1gital> cubed: try this:   sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
[10:21] <krzych> buy buy
[10:21] <nolimitsoya> krzych,
[10:21] <sampo_v2> my edgy upgrade list was suddenly huge: gnome, gimp, xorg, etc. is this normal or is my sources.list screwed up?
[10:21] <krzych> is somebody go to sleep?
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> krzych, did you ask somthing?
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> *e
[10:22] <trappist> sampo_v2: lotsa updates today
[10:22] <krzych> what
[10:22] <sampo_v2> trappist: any problems with the updates?
[10:22] <Dima> Does Zune work on ubuntu?
[10:22] <huibert> sampo_v2: my edgy upgrade was a 400 MB download
[10:22] <krzych> it doesn't matter
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> krzych, you asked what something was, but didnt specify what what whas :P
[10:22] <d1gital> huibert: one last question..  all he screenshots i'm seeing of beryl are using it in gnome.  will i be able to use kde?
[10:22] <LRP> okay, so use EXT3, but doesn't the boot partition have to be within the first 1024cyl?
[10:22] <krzych> buybuy
=== acez is now known as aceZ
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> LRP, no
[10:22] <trappist> sampo_v2: I haven't had any, but I don't use gnome and I haven't restarted X yet
[10:23] <Cubed> m
[10:23] <trappist> sampo_v2: from the changelogs, it looks like the X changes are just dependencies, so I don't see how there could be any problems with that
[10:23] <krzych> ok thank you i 'm not really anderstand you
[10:23] <huibert> d1gital: afaik kde works too, but look at the beryl page
[10:23] <sampo_v2> trappist: xserver-xorg is on the upgrade list
[10:23] <sampo_v2> trappist: but maybe i can upgrade
[10:24] <krzych> are you nver will go to sleep ?
[10:24] <krzych> never/
[10:24] <krzych> ?
[10:24] <LRP> nolimitsoya, so is what your saying by using /home, to not create a /boot partition?
[10:24] <hilz_> Agrajag: does vino work if it is running on ubuntu, and the two clinents that want to share their desktops are both windows machines?
[10:24] <nolimitsoya> LRP, just create a / and /home. you dont need /boot, or any other separate partition, unless youre doing something very special
[10:24] <krzych> ok buy buy no body want talking with me :(
[10:25] <LRP> nolimitsoya, what classifies as special?
[10:25] <nolimitsoya> LRP, i cant think of anything that special right now... so, youll be fine :P
[10:25] <schorem> I'm having problems after an update to edgy. Mouse doesn't work. It freezes after a while with the fglrx drivers. Ideas?
[10:25] <LRP> nolimitsoya, when I described my goal to my friend he said I would need to do it that way
[10:25] <thomaswebb> hi, does anyone here know how to setup an edgy box as a pop3 mail server?
[10:25] <nolimitsoya> LRP, and your goal is?
[10:26] <sysrage> god damn.. hot chick standin next to me leaning on desk stickin her ass out.. hard to resist
[10:26] <nolimitsoya> !offtopic | sysrage
[10:26] <ubotu> sysrage: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[10:26] <sysrage> lol sorry. meant that for another channel
[10:26] <Anarch> help.ubuntu.com is extremely slow for me, so I want to read Ubuntu manuals locally if possible ... but I don't know where they should be if already installed, or what to apt-get.  This is a server.
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> sysrage, while we are on the subject anyway... pics? :)
[10:27] <LRP> nolimitsoya, oh man, thats a can of worms, to create a dual boot machine with independent operating systmes that either can be scrapped/replaced without affecting the other, and without affecting the booting process,
[10:27] <schorem> noone on the usb freeze with fglrx?
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> LRP, no it isnt. you just need / and /home. grub will take care of booting and chainloading
[10:27] <LRP> nolimitsoya, I hear all of these stories of people setting up their machine dual boot after an XP install, then changing something and they can't get back into either system because the boot loaders got confused or overwritten or something
[10:28] <tritio> Hello guys, i hope that feel fine. I need find a book, please help me. PETROLEUM ENGINEERING J.S. Archer & C. G. Wall ..... Thnks
[10:28] <nolimitsoya> LRP, that will always happen, but doesnt correlate with /boot in any way. youll always need to repair the bootmanager if you reinstall windows, fex
[10:28] <Taku42> I just installed Ubuntu Server 6.10 on an older system with a D-Link NIC that has the RTL8319 chipset, and the 8139too driver errors trying to probe it (returns error -16), and PCI returns problems as well with reserving I/O regions or so
[10:28] <nolimitsoya> LRP, that no big issue
[10:28] <nolimitsoya> *anyway
[10:28] <gnomefreak> tritio: ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:28] <Bakefy> can anyone here help me with wine?
[10:29] <d1gital> LRP:  the best strategy i have found is:   install windows First.   you can install grub or lilo from the ubuntu cd, but if you're doing 2 installs anyway, odds are you don't have any valuable data
[10:29] <Bakefy> I have installed wine, but I do not know how to run it.   or use it.
[10:29] <chable> anyone can help me with a firewall config ?
[10:29] <nolimitsoya> Bakefy, if you want to install it we can. if you want it to work, no. go to the wine support channel
[10:29] <timo90> hi, how do i edit a text file using sudo
[10:29] <timo90> ?
[10:29] <gnomefreak> timo90: gksudo gedit file
[10:29] <nolimitsoya> chable, 'sudo apt-get install firestarter && gksudo firestarter'
[10:29] <d1gital> bakefy:  sudo wine [.exe file] 
[10:30] <timo90> thank you
[10:30] <gnomefreak> yw
[10:30] <Bakefy> what does sudo mean>?
[10:30] <chable> the rc.firewall dont work ?
[10:30] <timo90> im stuck in a terminal,wish me luck
[10:30] <gnomefreak> !sudo | Bakefy
[10:30] <ubotu> Bakefy: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:30] <nolimitsoya> !root | Bakefy
[10:30] <chable> ill try this firestarter
[10:30] <LRP> okay guys, thanks for your help, I'm gonna get back to work and play around a bit, will probably be back for more help later :) Thanks again!
[10:30] <chable> never did it

[10:30] <chable> is my first time
[10:31] <chable> E: Couldn't find package firestarter
[10:31] <rsl> Howdy! I'm just checking to see if it's indeed safe to oerform the xserver update. I remember the bad update a few months ago and I don't have time to reinstall my system. Heh.
[10:31] <timo90> chable do you have beryl
[10:31] <timo90> chabe:
[10:31] <nolimitsoya> !firestarter | chable
[10:31] <ubotu> chable: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[10:31] <d1gital> type this in a terminal window without the quotes:    'sudo wine '         and then the .exe file you are trying to run, then hit enter
[10:31] <sysdoc> Anyone know if there is an OpenOffice channel somewhere??
[10:31] <nolimitsoya> sysdoc, look on the official webpage
[10:32] <sysdoc> been there done that

[10:38] <nolimitsoya> Dima, firestarter will provide you with a firewall. apt-get it
[10:38] <d1gital> Trainstroker if you are already running ubuntu, just do:   gksudo "update-manager -c -d"
[10:38] <Raven_> I was just going to use one because of the windows machines on the network, do you think it is necessary or not?
[10:38] <nolimitsoya> Dima, clamav can also be apt-got, but you dont need it

[10:39] <jrib> Cubed: I believe ndiswrapper is in the repositories, so you don't need to download a package (but I will have the bot tell you how to do taht too in case you ever need it).  I recommend you read the first link though
[10:39] <nolimitsoya> chable, did it install? try 'apt-get install firestarter' and read the output

[10:40] <Dima> whats apt-get? and what does it mean to install something using synaptic

[11:49] <econobeing> hmm, after a reboot, knetworkmanager can find my wifi connection
[11:49] <psusi> _goofy_: what program?
[11:50] <wogi> Mm. so i guess no one knows a way to see which pkg a file belongs to..?:/
[11:50] <econobeing> but when i go to connect it seems to hang at 38%
[11:50] <econobeing> 28%*
[11:50] <psusi> wogi: dpkg -S /path/to/file
[11:50] <kevin>  what is the command to check the root filesystem in 6.10?
[11:50] <max_> PgR: is there not a way to do it without uninstalling linux and erasing everying
[11:50] <_goofy_> utorrent throught wine
[11:50] <psusi> kevin: same as it has allways been on any linux system, fsck /
[11:51] <kevin> thanks
[11:51] <der0b> Hey folks, does anyone know if there are plans to update source-o-matic for edgy?
[11:51] <PgR> max_: ooh, good question... maybe qtparted? More intelligent folks than me around here... maybe they know...
[11:51] <econobeing> should i just let it try to connect and wait it out?
[11:52] <kwood> Could anyone tell me... does the server version of ubu include a graphical interface like the desktop version I am looking for many of the functions of the server install... but am still learning linux and its ins and outs and looking for the graphical assistance..
[11:53] <wogi> psusi: thanks :)
[11:53] <alaa_> does anybody know how to set up beryl?
[11:53] <kevin> wow, I think i just changed my entire system to read-only, how do i change it back?
[11:53] <crackcorn> lol
[11:53] <cpk1> remount it?
[11:53] <finalbeta> kwood, not by default, but you can install a graphical interface after the install.
[11:53] <vonderer> hi there!
[11:53] <cobra_> kevin: sudo mount -t ?? -o remount,rw /
[11:53] <cobra_> no
[11:53] <cobra_> sudo mount -o remount,rw /

[11:54] <vonderer> how can i switch my X cursor theme?
[11:54] <Dan_Edin> is there a netinstall iso of ubuntu somewhere?
[11:54] <kevin> cobra: i love you
[11:54] <kevin> thanks
[11:54] <cobra_> 'welcome
[11:55] <JohnUK89> cobra_: http://rafb.net/paste/results/022D1g76.html is iwconfig's output, there were no references to wlan0 at all in /etc/network/interfaces
[11:55] <hjmills> how can i add a second monitor and set it to display a program that takes seperate input from the rest of my entire desktop and runs independant with out the mouse and everything (using lirc)
[11:55] <finalbeta> kwood, no... You have ubuntu server, that's for server usage. Has no GUI, and then you have ubuntu xubuntu kubuntu etc for desktop that have there own windowmanager to provide a GUI.
[11:55] <finalbeta> kwood, use a desktop one and start with that, you can run server on it 2...
[11:55] <cobra_> JohnUK89: were there references to eth0?
[11:55] <vonderer> i mean, without using gnome, xfce or KDE... (actually, i prefer different WMs)
[11:55] <JohnUK89> Yeah, I removed them
[11:56] <JohnUK89> The only one there now is lo
[11:56] <cobra_> JohnUK89: are you on a laptop?
[11:56] <JohnUK89> Nope, desktop
[11:56] <kwood> finalbeta: yah, I was just looking for an easy way to get LAMP and etc up... but it may be worthwhile to experience the install process of the server progs.
[11:56] <lee2> hi i have a belkin 802.11g wireless card, belkin told me it works with ubuntu 'out of the box' yet the live cd doesnt "see" any network devices. Should i bother installing ubuntu, if i cant see the wireless card ?

[11:56] <cobra_> lee2: you will need a little time to make it work, but it's fairly easy
