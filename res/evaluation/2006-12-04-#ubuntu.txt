[12:01] <james> hopefully i'm not the only person to have made this mistake...?
[12:01] <LjL> Windy: because they're set up so that they're started using gksudo by default, most often
[12:01] <Windy> james: chances are, i've made it sometime in the last 24hrs
[12:01] <Windy> LjL: now that's what i call smart.
[12:01] <Sinistrad> james, probably not -- the design isn't very intuitive for people who have seen normal scrollbars ;)
[12:01] <IndyGUnFreak> how difficult is it to rip DVD's with Acid rip?
[12:02] <WilderSon> hi, can anyone tell me how to install the vdr-dev package on edgy?
[12:02] <cheesybobman> hi
[12:02] <LjL> !info vdr-dev
[12:02] <Windy> errr...tried synaptic or apt-get?
[12:02] <ubotu> vdr-dev: Video Disk Recorder for DVB cards. In component universe, is extra. Version 1.4.0-2 (edgy), package size 236 kB, installed size 844 kB
[12:02] <LjL> WilderSon: enable universe, and "sudo apt-get install vdr-dev"
[12:03] <WilderSon> Windy: tried with synaptics .. i thought it was the same
[12:03] <Windy> hmm
[12:03] <cheesybobman> i have ubuntu 6.06 running on my acer aspire 5002wlmi. i can't get my wireless card to work, and yes, i already looked at the help/tutorial on the website. Help please?
[12:03] <Windy> well i assume there's a resaon it doesn't work?
[12:03] <Windy> since if it worked via synaptic then you'd hardly come here
[12:03] <npk> for a windows/ubuntu dual boot (windows install first) on the same hd, is grub installed to the mbr?
[12:03] <james> oh, while there's helpful people about (somewhat off-topic, so sorry) - is there a simpler alternative to Vive (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=114946) for encoding video for video ipods?
[12:03] <LjL> WilderSon: Synaptic. Synaptics is a kind of touchpad. anyway, yeah, you can use whatever.
[12:03] <IndyGUnFreak> thats the one thing Ubuntu, and Linux in general needs to work on, is makign setting up Wireless easier
[12:03] <james> or, is there a decent alternative to ipods that provide decent video functionality, including tv-out
[12:03] <Windy> IndyGUnFreak: in what sense?
[12:03] <Matthew_W> Hey - I have a real problem with the root/user password on the Breezy LiveCD.
[12:03] <Jassossovinik> cheesybobman, it's probably best if you just want it to work to undo everything you have done so far and use ndiswrapper (if you have a broadcom card which is what i think is in the acer aspire 5XXX series)
[12:03] <Windy> location profiles?
[12:04] <LjL> IndyGUnFreak: it is pretty easy, with cards that have drivers.
[12:04] <Windy> even those that dont tbh
[12:04] <james> i'm thinking of getting an ipod video while i'm in the US (dollar is soooo cheap at the moment!)
[12:04] <Matthew_W> I set a password during the livecd bootup, and now it's not the same, which is irritating!
[12:04] <WilderSon> well anyway it dows not install in my ubuntu, cause it relies in dvb-core
[12:04] <IndyGUnFreak> LJL, that may be the case, i'm not super familiar with it, but man theres' a lot of posts on various forums on how to d it.
[12:04] <Windy> IndyGUnFreak: going on a hunch
[12:04] <IndyGUnFreak> which tells me, its probably not that simple.
[12:04] <Windy> have a look at network-manager
[12:04] <WilderSon> which is not  there -- dvb-core
[12:04] <Windy> and umm
[12:04] <Windy> there's another one
[12:04] <Jassossovinik> Matthew_W, are you sure "caps" isn't an issue perhaps?
[12:04] <Windy> network-- something
[12:04] <Matthew_W> Tried.
[12:04] <LjL> IndyGUnFreak: no, it just tells you that people fiddle with ndiswrapper because they own cards that don't have linux drivers
[12:04] <Matthew_W> It's not.
[12:04] <IndyGUnFreak> lol, thats probably true.
[12:05] <Windy> my whacky wireless PCMCIA card worked no probs
[12:05] <cheesybobman> ok well i tried to use ndiswrapper. i decompressed it and did what it said in the readme, but it still didn't work
[12:05] <cheesybobman> basically i couldn't install it
[12:05] <Windy> no driver installation, nothing
[12:05] <LjL> see?
[12:05] <killown> how I do mplayer to set video as wallpaper?
[12:05] <IndyGUnFreak> oh well, i didnt trust wireless security under Windows, so I ran a wired network in my house..
[12:05] <IndyGUnFreak> no fears.
[12:05] <Matthew_W> Irritating.
[12:05] <Windy> the buggering bit is setting up location profiles
[12:05] <Matthew_W> I don't know how to fix this and I need to fix my bloody partition.
[12:05] <Windy> in dapper i had to dig around for ages to get network-manager to work
[12:06] <Windy> in edgy there's another package that seems to do it better
[12:06] <Windy> forget it's name tho
[12:06] <killown> how I do mplayer to set video as wallpaper?
[12:06] <LjL> Matthew_W, i don't know about your issue, but you should probably leave Breezy behind anyway... it's old. in a couple of months, it won't be supported anymore.
[12:06] <npk> anyone running a windows/ubuntu dual boot?
[12:06] <Windy> me.
[12:06] <mercykiller> npk: Yeah
[12:06] <LjL> !anyone
[12:06] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:06] <WilderSon> ubotu: yes it says the same on my dist - i cannot install cause it does not find dvb-core or kernel >2.5---
[12:06] <Windy> Ubuntu and WinXP
[12:06] <npk> LJL thanks, and I did ^^
[12:06] <Matthew_W> LjL, I'm doing an install of MacOSX and using Breezy to partition the hard drive, so needless to say I need to run GParted or install an equivalent partition editor for bash, and I can't without a password.
[12:06] <Windy> Ubuntu for most stuff, WinXP in case I run into compatibility issues
[12:07] <npk> wondering if grub gets installed to the mbr or the linux partition
[12:07] <Windy> hmm
[12:07] <Windy> no idea sorry
[12:07] <mercykiller> I think the linux partition
[12:07] <itsmabus> what's the my network places equivalent in ubuntu
[12:07] <sysrage> npk: can be either
[12:07] <LjL> Matthew_W, given it's just the live CD, why don't you... reboot?
[12:07] <Hoag> Hey. Is it possible to choose the title of a program as you load it? I.E, The title of Winee is "C:\blahblahblah". Is there something I can add to the command to choose my own?
[12:07] <finalbeta_> npk, mbr I believe.
[12:07] <Matthew_W> LjL - This has happened more than once.
[12:07] <npk> sysrage: no what the default is?
[12:07] <grndslm> anybody here use ubuntu on an ASUS laptop??
[12:07] <sysrage> npk: mbr if you wanna use grub to choose the OS, partition if you want to use ntloader
[12:07] <Matthew_W> LjL - That's the first thing I did.
[12:08] <itsmabus> how can I view windows shares from ubuntu
[12:08] <LADoctor> need help!! which one to instal: ubuntu, kubuntu, edubuntu, and xubuntu; what's the difference.
[12:08] <grndslm> LADoctor:  what are your system specs?
[12:08] <IndyGUnFreak> i didnt' know asus made laptops
[12:08] <CarlFK> grndslm: I do
[12:08] <Windy> ubuntu/kubuntu/xubuntu just use diff desktop thingies
[12:08] <IndyGUnFreak> their motherboards are OK however
[12:08] <LjL> Matthew_W: well, i don't really remember what the breezy CD was like, in dapper the username is "ubuntu" and the password is blank (though it doesn't ask for the username by default, in GDM)
[12:08] <grndslm> CarlFK:  what laptop do you have?
[12:08] <Windy> ubuntu = GNOME, kubuntu = KDE, xubuntu = X i assume
[12:08] <killown> how I do mplayer to set video as wallpaper?
[12:08] <mercykiller> Xubuntu = XFCE
[12:09] <Matthew_W> xubuntu is xfce
[12:09] <finalbeta_> itsmabus, smb://finalbeta@192.168.20.2 in nautilus, or use the connect to server dialog from nautilus to make a link
[12:09] <Windy> edubuntu is designed for classroom/education environments
[12:09] <jrib> LADoctor: ubuntu uses GNOME, kubuntu uses KDE, edubuntu has school based stuff and uses GNOME, xubuntu uses xfce.  These are all just defaults, you can use the same thing on any of the *buntu's
[12:09] <Windy> ah right, my mistake then
[12:09] <Matthew_W> LjL-  well rg.  This is insanely irritating.
[12:09] <npk> sysrage: I use grub, but something happened a little while back, and the windows boot sector was corrupted, in trying to fix it, i wiped out grub too. i got grub back, on the mbr, but still cant get into windows, so now im trying to repair things to how they were
[12:09] <CarlFK> grndslm: um.. i du no
[12:09] <Matthew_W> LjL because I need to edit the partitions one way or another here.
[12:09] <grndslm> CarlFK:  do you like the build quality, and how well is the hardware supported in ubuntu?
[12:09] <Matthew_W> LjL there's no workaround in the LiveCD or a bug or something I can exploit ffs?
[12:09] <Windy> the hazards of being a linux newbie trying to act like he knows something :( that's me for you
[12:09] <IndyGUnFreak> Kubuntu is a terrible interface in my opinion, i don't know how anyone uses it...
=== _greenie_ is now known as _greenie
[12:09] <IndyGUnFreak> Ubuntu is ok, and Xubuntu is moderate
[12:10] <IndyGUnFreak> Kubuntu gives me a headache looking at it.
[12:10] <IndyGUnFreak> i assume a lot of folks like it because of KDE's similarity to Windows...
[12:10] <itsmabus> finalbeta_: what about with thunar?
[12:10] <Windy> IndyGUnFreak: out of interest, were you running wireless on a laptop?
[12:10] <killown> how I do mplayer to set video as wallpaper?
[12:10] <finalbeta_> itsmabus, no idea
[12:10] <Windy> actually, i found GNOME just as easy to get over to, and i'm a diehard windows user
[12:10] <IndyGUnFreak> no Windy, you might have missed it, but I don't trust wireless security at all, I wired my home network
[12:10] <LjL> Matthew_W, i haven't a clue tbh
[12:10] <Windy> still am, but ubuntu is a nice side-dish
[12:11] <mercykiller> npk: Boot the xp disk, fixmbr. Boot knoppix, grub-install?
[12:11] <mercykiller> Not sure but that might work
[12:11] <Windy> IndyGUnFreak: oh, i see...why'd you ask about wireless on ubuntu then?
[12:11] <grndslm> CarlFK:  I'm really trying to find out if suspend-to-hd & suspend-to-ram work well on ASUS laptops
[12:11] <IndyGUnFreak> i didn't,
[12:11] <Windy> righto
[12:11] <Windy> let's just toss that and assume my old age is catching up with my mental prowess
[12:11] <LADoctor> sorry, my specks are amd athlone 1800; RAM 520MG and geforce fx 5500
[12:11] <IndyGUnFreak> was just saying i see so many questions on it, it seems thats one thing that needs to be made easier, just a comment really
[12:11] <Windy> hmm
[12:11] <Windy> i see
[12:12] <Windy> well if anything wireless networking was remarkably smooth
[12:12] <LjL> 520MG of RAM? that's pretty impressive
[12:12] <Windy> and i've got a tricky config
[12:12] <Matthew_W> When I run "users" there's like 9 users called "ubuntu"
[12:12] <IndyGUnFreak> i could be off base though, like you said, and its just people who aren't paying attention, try one thing, and it doesn't work, so they start asking questions.
[12:12] <Windy> 520 milligrams?
[12:12] <grndslm> LADocotor:  use ubuntu or kubuntu, that comes down to personal preference
[12:12] <IndyGUnFreak> 520 megowatts
[12:12] <Windy> well...the thing is, i didn't have to try anything
[12:12] <LADoctor> sorry
[12:12] <Windy> it was up and running out of the box
[12:12] <LADoctor> 520mb ram
[12:12] <LADoctor> lol
[12:12] <Windy> and i'm using a PCMCIA card...a very odd one too
[12:12] <IndyGUnFreak> oh i understand, and i tend to agree with you, its probably laziness the reason most people have to post and ask questions...
[12:12] <jrib> LADoctor: install ubuntu and then install the 'kubuntu-desktop' package.  Then you will have both ubuntu and kubuntu and can decide :)
[12:13] <Windy> you'd expect ME to have problems, not the people out there with centrinos
[12:13] <IndyGUnFreak> becuase most of the time, other users have them online with little effort, and generally by directing them to pages appropriate instructions
[12:13] <Windy> i suppose
[12:13] <Windy> linux has a chunky learning curve though
[12:14] <Windy> you can call windows insecure all you want, but fact is the learning curve is a lot less steep
[12:14] <qbit> anyone know where to find a w32codecs?
[12:14] <Windy> saying that in this channel is probably a bit suicidal
[12:14] <IndyGUnFreak> no doubt about that.
[12:14] <Windy> qbit: going off memory, i think add/remove has it
[12:14] <IndyGUnFreak> no, i agree with you.
[12:14] <LADoctor> what are the other differences between them
[12:14] <Jassossovinik> Windy, you say that, however I believe a lot of it is "unlearning" windows. My grandmother (massively untechnological) learnt to surf and stuff fast on linux.
[12:15] <Windy> qbit: failing that, try opening up terminal and typing 'sudo apt-get install w32codecs' or whatever the name of the package is
[12:15] <Windy> Jassossovinik: yeah you're probably right
[12:15] <Jassossovinik> qbit:
[12:15] <Windy> but my gripe isn't with the basic stuff
[12:15] <Jassossovinik> !w32codecs
[12:15] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[12:15] <IndyGUnFreak> yeah, w32codecs can be annoying, and the whole libdvdcss thing is freakin annoying to.
[12:15] <qbit> thanks Jassossovinik
[12:15] <Windy> surfing the net and stuff like that is much the same on linux versus windows
[12:16] <mercykiller> LADoctor: Gnome tries to be simple while KDE tries to have a lot of graphical features
[12:16] <IndyGUnFreak> yep, like right now, i'm struggling to rip a movie...lol
[12:16] <Windy> i came over from doing that on windows to doing it here with no real hassle
[12:16] <LADoctor> i started getting into linux in 2000 but then just went back to windows as i did not have a coppy of any linux,  and when I first tried to use it it was RedHat
[12:16] <LADoctor> oh! Thanks.
[12:16] <Windy> but it's the stuff that's got a slight bit more technical-ness to it that's seemingly harder on nix
[12:16] <Windy> i'm saying this as my observation because it always seems to involve more steps
[12:17] <Windy> more complex ones, and apparently more ways you can bugger up your whole system
[12:17] <IndyGUnFreak> someone get the guillotine, we need it for Windy
[12:17] <Windy> e.g. I've managed to nearly hose my whole GUI just trying to install trackpoint scrolling support
[12:17] <IndyGUnFreak> blasphemer!  heretic!
[12:17] <zylche> I only have a hacksaw.
[12:17] <Windy> lol
[12:17] <IndyGUnFreak> :)
[12:17] <zylche> Well, part..
[12:17] <mercykiller> heh
[12:17] <IndyGUnFreak> off with her head
[12:17] <zylche> Is it okay if it's rusty?
[12:17] <Windy> i can almost see a linux mob outside my door
[12:17] <Windy> his
[12:17] <Windy> HIS
[12:17] <jono> Windy: thats normal :P
[12:18] <IndyGUnFreak> oh  my bad
[12:18] <azion> Hello all, could anyone tell me how I can get rid of the password prompt after my monitor sleeps?
[12:18] <Windy> bah, why do people look at the nick 'Windy' and think 'her'
[12:18] <zylche> Windy, a mob of angry penguins going at 100mph?
[12:18] <IndyGUnFreak> not sure where you are, but here in America, its a female name.
[12:18] <Windy> zylche: angry penguins i can deal with
[12:18] <kurisutofuaa> Does any one know of any programs for minidics player support for edgy amd64?
[12:18] <IndyGUnFreak> minidics...lol
[12:18] <finalbeta_> One of the things, is, on windows you are allowed to ask the most stupid questions and get an answer. In here you get a read the man page. It's a mentality thing. Actually, if you let allot of people ask the dumb questions they might answer each other and the would all learn faster and be happier.
[12:18] <Windy> it's a mob of angry linux nerds threatening to bash me with install CDs and download distros that scares me
[12:19] <finalbeta_> Windy, don't worry, i'l draw the mob to me.
[12:19] <IndyGUnFreak> adn we'll all be yelling terminal commands while we do it windy...lol
[12:19] <Windy> i think it's a tradeoff
[12:19] <Windy> on windows, you do anything and you chance messing up your system in the longterm
[12:19] <Windy> on linux you do anything and you chance immediately hosing the whole lot
[12:19] <jrib> finalbeta_: that's not really true
[12:19] <zylche> dd if=linux.bin of=/dev/Windy1
[12:20] <Windy> incidentally, 'windy' is just shortened for another nick i used from a game, didn't really pick it as a girl's name :/
[12:20] <qbit> cheers!
[12:20] <IndyGUnFreak> not to mention you have to be concerned about getting violently molested(in a computer sense), by every hacker, script kiddie virus writing fool out there
[12:20] <Windy> i can just see all the shouts
[12:20] <mercykiller> Heh
[12:20] <IndyGUnFreak> how long should it take Acidrip to rip a 2hr movie?
[12:20] <Asc> What's the name of the program that lists all the program options and settings and things?
[12:21] <jrib> Asc: man name_of_program     you mean?
[12:21] <CarlFK> grndslm: for me, 'hybernate to HD' works somethings, the other times I get 'not enough space'
[12:21] <Windy> IndyGUnFreak: i can give you a murphy's estimate
[12:21] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[12:21] <IndyGUnFreak> well it doesn't look like Acidrip is doing anything
[12:21] <Asc> jrib: What I have in mind is a GUI program that allows one to change the settings of most programs
[12:21] <Windy> typically, it takes at least twice as long as the movie's length
[12:21] <finalbeta_> jrib, i agree. This channel has a nice attitude and newbies help newbies in here. I now answer the questions I asked 4 months ago myself.
[12:21] <mercykiller> Asc: webmin?
[12:21] <jrib> Asc: gconf-editor?
[12:21] <wikijeff> In openoffice's formula editor, how can I group terms without having it display parenthesis? For example, I'd like to have sqrt (a b) without it displaying parenthesis around the a b.
[12:21] <zylche> IndyGUnFreak, have you paid it yet?
[12:21] <Windy> + an extra hour for each 30mins you're going to enjoy the movie
[12:21] <LjL> Asc: gedit?
[12:21] <IndyGUnFreak> paid?.. no, it was in the repos
[12:22] <mercykiller> LjL: heh
[12:22] <zylche> It needs money in advance to cover court fees
[12:22] <Asc> gconf-editor wins
[12:22] <Jordie> I need some help!
[12:22] <Windy> finalbeta_: actually, i find myself answering questions i asked a week ago, and then realising i just dispensed wrong info
[12:22] <IndyGUnFreak> lol, well, i'll cover the costs with my illegal movie buisness...lol
[12:22] <Jordie> =Q
[12:22] <LjL> !ask | Jordie
[12:22] <ubotu> Jordie: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:22] <IndyGUnFreak> thats a joke, please, no FBI agents come a knockin
[12:22] <Vincebus> Just installed ubuntu on my p2 300 and was trying to allocate some more space from the 2nd drive that wasn't formatted. I  formatted it as /usr and now I can't get any of the prog's to work..aarggh, help!
[12:22] <Jordie> Well....
[12:22] <Jordie> At least I stated a fact.
[12:22] <Jordie> =)
[12:22] <finalbeta_> Windy, that's because I gave you the answer in the first place ;)
[12:22] <Windy> lol
[12:22] <brunob> hi, i am with a problem, i upgrade the system packages and... my X doesn't start now...
[12:23] <Windy> it's kinda sad actually
[12:23] <Jordie> Synaptic isn't working, it is just hanging there when I try to download X-Chat.
[12:23] <HumanPrototype> hi all
[12:23] <Windy> i haven't the foggiest about linux
[12:23] <Windy> but i'm answering questions :(
[12:23] <LjL> Jordie: i heard some mirror was down. perhaps it's that
[12:23] <Windy> it's like a monkey doing tech support
[12:23] <Vincebus> Do I have to reinstall it or is there an easier way to get the prog's back?
[12:23] <IndyGUnFreak> several are having that prob Jordie..
[12:23] <Jordie> mk.
[12:23] <IndyGUnFreak> some suggest its the US Ubuntu servies
[12:23] <HumanPrototype> im trying to create a derivative distro for use as a thin client based on xubuntu
[12:23] <Jordie> I'll do it tomorrow.
[12:23] <brunob> i tried upgrade packages to olders but i don't have success :|
[12:23] <Windy> although...in light of things that's not all too uncommon
[12:23] <mercykiller> Windy: I was just about to say that...
[12:23] <IndyGUnFreak> jordie, do what i'm doing, screw e3verything up trying to work around it...lol
[12:23] <HumanPrototype> I have removed xfce and installed fluxbox but does anyone know how I can edit the config files?
[12:23] <Jordie> I don't like this XChat Gnome Application, how the users aren't shown and a bunch of other little things I hate. =q
[12:24] <Jordie> IndyGUnFreak:  What is step #1?
[12:24] <Windy> yeah the lack of user list is a bugger
[12:24] <IndyGUnFreak> the users are shown in the menu on the right.
[12:24] <Jordie> Yeah
[12:24] <Windy> and it doesn't show the username each line
[12:24] <Jordie> That is gay though.
[12:24] <Windy> if you type two lines in a row
[12:24] <Windy> i find it discomforting
[12:24] <Asc> Heh, next questing.  Can gconf-editor be used to change the theme?
[12:24] <Asc> *question
[12:24] <IndyGUnFreak> well, not everything is like AOL...lol
[12:24] <mercykiller> Asc: gnome-theme-manager
[12:24] <Jordie> IndyGUnFreak:  Nope, the rest is like MSN.
[12:24] <Jordie> :)
[12:24] <Windy> Jordie: i'd say it's annoying, a gay program would be consistently pestering you to install a back-end
[12:24] <Vincebus> Hello, I need some help...
[12:24] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[12:25] <IndyGUnFreak> i hate MSN to,
[12:25] <Jordie> Windy: :P
[12:25] <Windy> Vincebus: don't worry, we all do.
[12:25] <Vincebus> Heh...
[12:25] <Vincebus> thanks
[12:25] <Windy> as for your issue
[12:25] <Windy> i'm afraid to say i have no idea
[12:25] <mercykiller> Vincebus: did you copy your old /usr partition to the new drive?
[12:25] <Asc> mercykiller: the trouble with that is that I think when you start gnome-theme-manager, it tries to apply the currently selected theme.  The trouble with that is, the currently selected theme makes any program using it crash.
[12:25] <IndyGUnFreak> i added a bunch of repos from the ubuntu edgy FAQ, and its letting me install some stuff that iw as trying to install with Synaptic
[12:25] <killown>  I couldnt find it exactly but if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be cool. I had installed beryl a while back and everything has been working really well. All of a sudden the top bar for my menus has disappeared. I dont know what i did so i was wondering do i need to uninstall and reinstall it or is it just a bug that happens in edgy eft. thx in advance to all replies
[12:25] <killown> Reply With Quote  beryl hide bar mimimize/maximize
[12:25] <finalbeta_> brunob, did you try reconfiguring xorg? sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:25] <Jordie> I also hate it how you can't have two servers open in one application.
[12:26] <jrib> Asc: it can:/desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_theme or /apps/metacity/general/theme depending on what theme you are referring to
[12:26] <Jordie> You have to open another session.
[12:26] <killown> anyone can help?
[12:26] <HumanPrototype> Asc remove the current theme files then use gnome-theme-manager
[12:26] <mercykiller> Asc: I know what you mean, but it's only happened to me with firefox before

[12:26] <bam_> Hi I was wondering if anyone could tell me why I get a port change everytime I execute a command on my ftp server? After a command like "ls" I get a "150 Connecting to port 41169" or something...what is this?
[12:26] <bam_> the command is executed, but what does that message mean?
[12:26] <Vincebus> all I did was format a partition on a completely different drive
[12:26] <con-man> how do i uninstall wine?
[12:27] <mercykiller> Vincebus: You didn't mount it, or anything?
[12:27] <grndslm> CarlFK:  you've never used Suspend before?
[12:27] <Vincebus> no...
[12:27] <Asc> Okay, that should do it.  I'm going to restart my X session and pray.
[12:27] <con-man> how do i uninstall wine?
[12:27] <Vincebus> sorry for my complete ignorance...
[12:28] <jrib> con-man: uninstall it through synaptic or apt-get
[12:28] <b0ss_> i need help i just did apt-get install ettercap i got it now how do i open it?
[12:28] <HumanPrototype> nm - i found it
[12:28] <con-man> i knew that
[12:28] <finalbeta_> bam_, ftp has a control connection and a data connection. When you log into the ftp you log into the control connection. Data/files/lists go over a data connection, a new connection to a port gets made for that. For more info. google.
[12:28] <b0ss_> i need help i just did apt-get install ettercap i got it now how do i open it?
[12:29] <reus> http://rafb.net/paste/results/VJhrxd27.html
[12:29] <reus> howto have sound on that cx card ?
[12:29] <mercykiller> Vincebus: What did you format the new drive as?
[12:29] <finalbeta_> b0ss_, it's probably got a shortcut in the internet menu. If you can't you start if from the commandline using it's name?
[12:29] <mercykiller> Like, what filesystem
[12:29] <stoorty> applications>internet
[12:29] <bam_> oh, ok. Thx. It is possible to make that connection on the random port connect to a fixed port?
[12:29] <Vincebus> I believe it was formatted as /usr
[12:29] <b0ss_> i need help i just did apt-get install ettercap i got it now how do i open it?
[12:29] <mercykiller> And this was after you installed ubuntu?
[12:29] <b0ss_> o
[12:29] <b0ss_> how do i start
[12:29] <Vincebus> yeah...just after...
[12:29] <b0ss_> it from command line
[12:29] <IndyGUnFreak> hey, i think i got DVD rip to work.
[12:30] <b0ss_> finalbeta: how do i open it from command line
[12:30] <mercykiller> And now you can't access any programs?
[12:30] <Vincebus> yup..
[12:30] <IndyGUnFreak> now i can go to the flea market and open up a Blockbuster Video..lol
[12:30] <asc> Well, starting the xfce theme manager thingy then running gnome-theme-whatever does work.
[12:30] <Vincebus> Should I just reload and repartition?
[12:31] <mercykiller> That'd probably be the easiest thing to do
[12:31] <b0ss_> finalbeta: how do i open it from command line
[12:31] <mercykiller> Or you could copy the old /usr partition over to the new drive, and make sure the new drive is being mounted on bootup
[12:31] <Jordie> I tried to install Internet Explorer and it isn't working.
[12:31] <Jordie> What is wrong!?@?!?!@
[12:31] <Vincebus> That's what I thought, just hoped there may be something even easier than that...but, oh well, live and learn...
[12:31] <Vincebus> Thanks for the help...
[12:31] <finalbeta_> bam_, I'm not sure what you mean with that last line. But you can't specify the port. The port gets generated by the server. You can however set a port range the server can use. It's something used often when behind nat so one can forward a set of ports to the server.
[12:31] <Jordie> I tried calling Microsoft and they said they don't support it. :q

[12:32] <finalbeta_> b0ss_, not sure, don't have it installed. try ethe<tab> , that will show you what files/programs are available with a name that start with ethe
[12:32] <Vincebus> it worked great other than that...tried to install Kubuntu and it wouldn't load past 87% for nothing...

[12:49] <mercykiller> So I'd say probably
[12:49] <IndyGUnFreak> lol Windy, me eith4er
[12:49] <blakkinferno> gksudo aptitude install cvs
[12:49] <IndyGUnFreak> ok, here's my issue.
[12:49] <Nick1> Hello all. Forgive my rudeness before: asking a question without greeting first. But I do have an actual Ubuntu question .. anyone up to suggesting an answer? I have upgraded to 6.10 from 6.06, and now I am experiencing various unrelated problems ... one of which is that I cannot see any files, even those I have permissions on, in Nautilus list view. Does anyone know this issue?
[12:49] <blakkinferno> i am new to Linux
[12:49] <blakkinferno> -.-
[12:49] <najand> blameless: US mirror is dead
[12:49] <IndyGUnFreak> I got dvd::rip to rip one chapter, but it won't rip the whole movie.
[12:49] <blameless> najand, mercykiller thanks :)
[12:49] <najand> blakkinferno: Me too
[12:49] <Windy`AFK> Nick1: i think it's a common problem
[12:50] <blameless> well, not really :) but you know
[12:50] <blakkinferno> najand: the us mirror is dead?!
[12:50] <mercykiller> Yeah
[12:50] <Flannel> blakkinferno: you don't need gksudo, just normal sudo for that.  And, if you're using the US repository mirror, you'll want to chnge that
[12:50] <mercykiller> The edgy upgrade is somewhat risky
[12:50] <Flannel> blakkinferno: us mirror goes down sometimes
[12:50] <blakkinferno> Flannel: How do i change that?
[12:50] <conreyt> Nick: have you rebooted since the upgrade to start using the new kernel?
[12:50] <Nick1> yes, I have rebooted.
[12:50] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Oh, i see. I am not doing anything wrong?
[12:50] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Cool ^^.
[12:50] <najand> blakkinferno: Yep
[12:50] <blakkinferno> Flannel: How do i change the mirror i am downloading from?
[12:50] <Flannel> blakkinferno: you'll want to edit your sources.list (gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list) then change "us.archive.ubuntu.com" to just "archive.ubuntu.com"
[12:50] <blakkinferno> Man, ubuntu is a lot nicer than windows.
[12:51] <blakkinferno> im glad i switched
[12:51] <blakkinferno> ^^
[12:51] <mercykiller> blakkinferno: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:51] <blakkinferno> Flannel: ok!
[12:51] <najand> blakkinferno: Edit your /etc/apt/source.list and remove "us." parts
[12:51] <blakkinferno> mercykiller: thanks.
[12:51] <blakkinferno> lol 3 answers
[12:51] <IndyGUnFreak> yeah, but doesn't it get boring not constantly updating virus/spyware software
[12:51] <mercykiller> np
[12:51] <Nick1> well, thanks conreyt.
[12:51] <IndyGUnFreak> scanning everything you download
[12:51] <blakkinferno> :) nice community
[12:51] <maquis> is it just my system, or is us.archive.ubuntu.com down temporarily?
[12:51] <IndyGUnFreak> checking emails for trojans
[12:51] <blakkinferno> maquis: yes
[12:51] <mercykiller> maquis: It's down
[12:51] <IndyGUnFreak> i mean, i kinda miss that stuff.
[12:51] <najand> maquis: It is down for now
[12:51] <Flannel> maquis: its down at the moment
[12:51] <conreyt> Nick: I didn't catch an anser to my question... sry. what was it?
[12:51] <maquis> blakkinferno: is there an ETA?
[12:52] <conreyt> Nick1: I didn't catch an anser to my question... sry. what was it?
[12:52] <blakkinferno> Oh another quick question
[12:52] <maquis> (or anyone else?)
[12:52] <najand> And have been down since last night
[12:52] <blakkinferno> To use WineX/Cedega
[12:52] <blakkinferno> do i have to uninstall the original WINE if i have it?
[12:52] <kitche> IndyGUnFreak: you can still do it but it won't do much good :)
[12:52] <Nick1> Conreyt: yes, I did reboot. Problem persists.
[12:52] <Zaehlas> Anyone know how to modify the NFS folders I'm sharing out without using the GUI shares -admin?  Going through the GUI, it's not letting me change the settings, I mean it does, I hit OK, and they revert to what they were before.
[12:52] <IndyGUnFreak> true kitche
[12:52] <finalbeta_> blakkinferno, I'm not sure if you have to, but I think it might be wise to do so.
[12:52] <IndyGUnFreak> i've thought about installing Vmware player to keep the excitement...lol
[12:52] <mercykiller> hah
[12:52] <Flannel> blakkinferno: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BuildingWineFromSource
[12:52] <blakkinferno> finalbeta_: thanks...
[12:53] <IndyGUnFreak> my understanding is, it has to be protectedl ike the Windows OS.
[12:53] <blakkinferno> finalbeta_:how do i do that though?
[12:53] <blakkinferno> finalbeta_: uninstall it?
[12:53] <finalbeta_> Yes
[12:53] <najand> IndyGUnFreak: Excitement of Virtualism?
[12:53] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[12:53] <conreyt> Nick1: can you from a command line do an : sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:53] <mercykiller> blakkinferno: You can install the wine from source into /opt as well
[12:53] <mercykiller> That's what I usually do
[12:53] <Flannel> blakkinferno: read that page, it'll explain everything.
[12:53] <Windy`AFK> well
[12:53] <Windy`AFK> there's several i's
[12:53] <IndyGUnFreak> you know though, i think 60-70% of peoples problems, are these idiots out there using always on connections, with no firewall.
[12:53] <Windy`AFK> and an n as well
[12:54] <IndyGUnFreak> or at best, a software firewall only
[12:54] <Windy`AFK> oops
[12:54] <Windy`AFK> wrong chan
[12:54] <Windy`AFK> tra la la :(
[12:54] <IndyGUnFreak> i'ma firm believer in havinga good hardware firewall/router
[12:54] <mercykiller> IHeh
[12:54] <mercykiller> *Heh
[12:54] <blakkinferno> Flannel: okay, ill go check it out
[12:54] <IndyGUnFreak> ok, this is gettin annoying
[12:54] <IndyGUnFreak> i can't figure out how to rip this movie as 1 file
[12:54] <borg> do they have xorg.conf man pages that help me fine tune attributes of my specific card, say a radeon 900 pro ?
[12:55] <IndyGUnFreak> it wants to rip it in chapters
[12:55] <najand> I don't have a firewall and I don't need one
[12:55] <conreyt> IndyGUnFreak: the #ubuntu-offtopic channel is still there, calling out for your offtopic comments..
[12:55] <Nick1> I did the full upgrade thru Synaptic. I can enter the command line too, though.
[12:55] <IndyGUnFreak> anyone got a clue, DVD::rip::
[12:55] <jughead> The last time I used KDE there was an option when you right-clicked on a file to copy or move a file - the directory navigation was accessible from the right-click menu; is there a simolar option in Gnome?
[12:55] <IndyGUnFreak> conrey, will you relax, i asked a question
[12:55] <jughead> *similar
[12:55] <ademan> is unionfs any good? i was looking at slax as a possible solution for my usb stick (2gb) i'd love read/write permission to my usb drive, after all, it IS meant to be written to (unlike a livecd)
[12:55] <conreyt> ask in off topic I may answer :)
[12:55] <IndyGUnFreak> i'm sure for your efforts you'll be knighted with mod powers soon.
[12:55] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Wait
[12:55] <IndyGUnFreak> its not off topic, it has to do with linux software
[12:55] <blakkinferno> Flannel: I need to uninstall WINE
[12:55] <Comrade_S> jughead:  yes there is
[12:55] <blakkinferno> Flannel: this says how to build it?
[12:56] <najand> IndyGUnFreak: use #linux channel
[12:56] <blakkinferno> Flannel: I got it already with the whole "sudo aptitude install wine"
[12:56] <jughead> how do you turn it on Comrade_S ?
[12:56] <Flannel> blakkinferno: right, that's how to build the new version, you wanted to install the new version, right?
[12:56] <IndyGUnFreak> people just stare at blank screens in there
[12:56] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Now i want to remove it so that i can install WineX/Cedega
[12:56] <conreyt> InddyGUnFreak: this channel isn't for "general linux issues"
[12:56] <Windy`AFK> lol
[12:56] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Yea, i think. I want Cedega, but i need to get rid of the old one first.
[12:56] <Comrade_S> jughead:  what do oyu mean turn it on? its default behavior for every file manager(even explorer)
[12:56] <Windy`AFK> indeed
[12:56] <Windy`AFK> this channel is for UBUNTU
[12:56] <ademan> blakkinferno: the version of wine in the ubuntu repositories is hopelessly outdated, if you want wine add the repository as described at http://winehq.com
[12:56] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Also, the guide is for Dapper and Breezy? I have Edgy
[12:56] <najand> IndyGUnFreak: This channel is for Ubuntu Questions
[12:56] <cafuego_> IndyGUnFreak: May i suggest you type '/ignore conreyt' ?
[12:56] <Windy`AFK> IndyGUnFreak: the simple solution is to put the word 'Ubuntu' before each sentence
[12:56] <Flannel> blakkinferno: sudo aptitude remove --purge wine
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> well, its an ubuntu question.
[12:57] <blakkinferno> ademan: Oh, wow, thanks.
[12:57] <tuskernini> !wine
[12:57] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[12:57] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Ok, thanks
[12:57] <conreyt> cafuego_: thx I was looking for that syntax
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> lol Windy, how do you guys make comments come up in red?
[12:57] <Windy`AFK> e.g. Ubuntu, how's the weather today?
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> i know thats an X-chat question
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> so please dont tell me to take it elsewhere
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> is there an x-chat forum?
[12:57] <jughead> I have a send-to command, but it opens an email box... I don't want that
[12:57] <Windy`AFK> in red?
[12:57] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Okay, i typed that in
[12:57] <tuskernini> IndyGUnFreak, type the nick and comma then text
[12:57] <finalbeta_> IndyGUnFreak, #xchat
[12:57] <Windy`AFK> in mIRC you hit ctrl+k, not sure about otherwise
[12:57] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Yay, it removed it
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> oh ok..
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> finalbea, i get it
[12:57] <finalbeta_> ;p
[12:57] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Okay, so i needa to get WineX now
[12:57] <IndyGUnFreak> oops
[12:58] <blakkinferno> Flannel: SO first i gotta get CVS, now that i edited my sources.list
[12:58] <IndyGUnFreak> finalbeta_, i get it
[12:58] <mercykiller> "<Windy`AFK> IndyGUnFreak: the simple solution is to put the word 'Ubuntu' before each sentence" ->>> www.digg.com
[12:58] <IndyGUnFreak> did that work?
[12:58] <conreyt> cafuego_: thx I was looking for that syntax and it's /ignore <username> all
[12:58] <blakkinferno> Flannel: -whistle whistle hum hum- brb
[12:58] <kitche> blakkinferno: I wouldn't use cedegea-cvs
[12:58] <Windy`AFK> mercykiller: wha?
[12:58] <Windy`AFK> i think it's a highlight
[12:58] <mercykiller> Oh, nevermind
[12:58] <mercykiller> heh
[12:58] <blakkinferno> kitche: Haha, thanks for your help earlier ^^.
[12:58] <blakkinferno> kitche: What would you recommend?
[12:58] <Windy`AFK> errr....what's digg got to do with it?
[12:58] <blakkinferno> kitche: You helped me with some problems earlier today ^^.
[12:59] <kitche> blakkinferno: I would pay the 5 bucks to get the full cedega
[12:59] <Zaehlas> Anyone know how to modify the NFS folders I'm sharing out without using the GUI shares -admin?  Going through the GUI, it's not letting me change the settings, I mean it does, I hit OK, and they revert to what they were before.
[12:59] <ademan> would it be possible to install ubuntu onto a USB drive? (it's 2gb)  I was thinking about dsl or slax or something similar, but i'm all to comfortable with apt
[12:59] <finalbeta_> Windy`AFK, seriously, #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:59] <mercykiller> Well, considering that putting the word "ubuntu" before each topic works for posters there...
[12:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: Oh. Well, im content with a worse one.
[12:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: I am dual-booting, so if i really want
[12:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: I can just run it in XP
[12:59] <Windy`AFK> finalbeta_: i'm already there
[12:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: I just like ubuntu ^^
[12:59] <umista> is there a way to convert ntfs to ex3?
[12:59] <umista> is there a way to convert ntfs to ext3?
[12:59] <finalbeta_> ademan, I think 2GB is a little slim.
[01:00] <kitche> blakkinferno: well cedega-cvs is missing a lot of stuff that is needed, but wine is what cedega-cvs is really
[01:00] <IndyGUnFreak> ademan, i think puppy or damn small linux might be more appropriate for a USB install.
[01:00] <Flannel> umista: no.  Just have to copy data off, reformat, copy back on
[01:00] <mercykiller> umista: I don't think there's a direct conversion method
[01:00] <Windy`AFK> ademan: 2 GB won't be enough for normal use
[01:00] <umista> dam
[01:00] <Windy`AFK> you might JUST squeeze the OS in
[01:00] <blakkinferno> kitche: so cedega-cvs is like normal Wine?
[01:00] <finalbeta_> ademan, but it should be possible, search the forums, saw stuff about it.
[01:00] <Windy`AFK> but then you'd run low for programs, etc.
[01:00] <umista> anyone have a spare 300 gigs of space
[01:00] <Windy`AFK> umista: yes.
[01:00] <blakkinferno> kitche: dammit! i edited my sources.list, why is it connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com again!
[01:00] <Windy`AFK> conreyt/finalbeta_: there, i answered a question, happy?
[01:00] <kitche> blakkinferno: did you do sudo apt-get update
[01:01] <Flannel> blakkinferno: you need to update your apt-cache
[01:01] <umista> can linux resize ntfs hard drive?
[01:01] <blakkinferno> kitche: oooh. o.o
[01:01] <Asc> 2 GB might work if you do a server install and add things on from there instead of the other way around.
[01:01] <mercykiller> umista: Yes, though you should probably back up your data first
[01:01] <killown> how I do mplayer set video as wallpaper?
[01:01] <umista> and how
[01:01] <blakkinferno> kitche: But i dont think that will work cuz it connected to us.archive.ubuntu.com while doing it :O
[01:01] <IndyGUnFreak> mplayer set video as wallpaper?
[01:01] <mercykiller> I believe the LiveCD installer can resize automatically
[01:01] <blakkinferno> kitche: ugh!
[01:02] <blakkinferno> kitche: should i just wait until us is back up?
[01:02] <Flannel> blakkinferno: that means you didn't change your sources.list (or missed one).  You want to pastebin it?
[01:02] <killown> IndyGUnFreak yes
[01:02] <blakkinferno> Flannel: No, its ok
[01:02] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Ill just check
[01:02] <Asc> Just don't install CUPS, openoffice, java, tetex, linux-source, etc.
[01:02] <blakkinferno> Flannel: again
[01:02] <IndyGUnFreak> killown, i don't understand the question.
[01:02] <IndyGUnFreak> thus my ??
[01:02] <ExxonValdeez>  when i run a ./configure it tells me that the compiler cannot create executables, how do i fix this?
[01:02] <killown> put video running in wallpaper
[01:02] <Flannel> ExxonValdeez: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:03] <IndyGUnFreak> why in the world would you want to do that?.. my sister does that, it gives me a headache
[01:03] <ExxonValdeez> oh, thats the full command, thanks, im dumb
[01:03] <jughead> how do i change the default application for a given filetype in gnome/ubuntu?
[01:04] <IndyGUnFreak> good question
[01:04] <jughead> i prefer to listen to mp3s in xmmx not totem movie player
[01:04] <kitche> jughead: it's under system
[01:04] <ademan> Windy`AFK: well i'm definitely gonna strip out a lot of things, really any debian based system would be fine with me, i was thinking knoppix but i kinda wanted GNOME (or no DE at all and just fluxbox)
[01:04] <ExxonValdeez> yay it workd
[01:04] <IndyGUnFreak> jughead
[01:04] <IndyGUnFreak> right click an mp3
[01:04] <Windy`AFK> ademan: you could probably do it
[01:04] <IndyGUnFreak> click open with
[01:04] <IndyGUnFreak> then choose xmms
[01:04] <mercykiller> ademan: Could do a basic netinstall of debian
[01:04] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Grr, i got it, but i think i missed 1 us.archive
[01:04] <Windy`AFK> i'm just saying you'll spend your time picking at it
[01:05] <Windy`AFK> and having to fiddle with your space
[01:05] <blakkinferno> Flannel: off to edit again. -sigh-
[01:05] <IndyGUnFreak> actually, its right click/properties
[01:05] <jughead> ahh ok I see it now
[01:05] <jughead> thanks IndyGUnFreak
[01:05] <Windy`AFK> and i'm not entirely sure you can take your whole OS around on a drive and just plug it in and run, if that's what you're planning
[01:05] <IndyGUnFreak> EVERYONE LOOK, I WAS HELPFUL!
[01:05] <IndyGUnFreak> I SHOULD BE A MOD
[01:05] <mercykiller> heh
[01:05] <kitche> !caps|IndyGUnFreak
[01:05] <ubotu> IndyGUnFreak: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[01:05] <ademan> Windy`AFK: no its more i spend a lot of time at school so i wanted to be able to boot into linux and have subversion which i need badly
[01:06] <Windy`AFK> hmm
[01:06] <Windy`AFK> might not work
[01:06] <IndyGUnFreak> should aknown that as coming
[01:06] <Windy`AFK> i think booting off a USB disk is a bit fiddly
[01:06] <Flannel> ademan: why not just bring svn with you on the USB?
[01:06] <IndyGUnFreak> well, one other thing, i'm having keyboard issues, the keys are sticking, do you think thats an ubuntu issue?
[01:06] <kitche> ademan: there is only a few distros that will boot off usb slax, dsl, puppy is just three off the top of my head
[01:07] <jughead> now IndyGUnFreak can you tell  me how to eat aas much as I want any time i want and not be unhealthy?
[01:07] <stoorty> !nvidia
[01:07] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:07] <ademan> Flannel: not allowed to install things, and i assume that every once in a while i'll realize another program i'll want/need
[01:07] <Flannel> !language | jughead
[01:07] <ubotu> jughead: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:07] <jughead> just kidding that's off topic
[01:07] <IndyGUnFreak> lol jug
[01:07] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Something seems to be wrong :O.
[01:07] <dsnyders> IndyGUnFreak, Have you tried apt-get unstick-keys?
[01:07] <blakkinferno> Flannel: I even hit CTRL:F and searched us
[01:07] <Flannel> ademan: You can run svn off of the USB disk, it doesn't need to be installed.
[01:07] <Asc> IndyGUnFreak: It depends, does Ubuntu make you drool?
[01:07] <IndyGUnFreak> lol asc
[01:07] <Flannel> blakkinferno: pastebin your sources.list
[01:07] <abo> where can I find how much free space is left on a drive?
[01:07] <blakkinferno> Flannel: And nothing came up except "use" and "useful"
[01:07] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Okay, how do i do that?
[01:07] <IndyGUnFreak> no asc, but there is this one website
[01:07] <jughead> sorry that was just an extra "a" not an extra "s"
[01:07] <IndyGUnFreak> oh , nevermind
[01:07] <mercykiller> abo: df
[01:07] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Thanks for your help, man.
[01:08] <mercykiller> or sudo df
[01:08] <Flannel> blakkinferno: open it, copy all the text, paste it...
[01:08] <ademan> Flannel: i know but if i realize the need for another program (for example eclipse) and i don't have it on the usb disk, i'm screwed untill i go home and load eclipse onto the usb
[01:08] <Flannel> !page | blakkinferno
[01:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about page - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:08] <Flannel> er
[01:08] <conreyt> abo : df -h
[01:08] <Flannel> !paste | blakkinferno
[01:08] <ubotu> blakkinferno: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[01:08] <Asc> IndyGUnFreak: Gnome-look?
[01:08] <Flannel> blakkinferno: paste to that site, then get the URL it returns, and post it here
[01:08] <Jassossovinik> blakkinferno, i've found that the pastebin at www.pastebin.it is faster :-)
[01:08] <Discerer> so, I'm trying to conf unrealIRCd Comrade_S and I get this problem: http://pastey.net/2980
[01:09] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[01:09] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Ill use Jass... whatevers site ^^
[01:09] <Flannel> ademan: I'm not sure how booting into linux helps you there.  Are you not allowed to download stuff from the web?  I imagine if they restrict you from that, you won't be able to edit the BIOS to boot from a USB either
[01:10] <ademan> Flannel: but with a grub boot disk couldn't i?
[01:10] <marquedios> ademan: unless they have the first boot device as the hard drive :(
[01:11] <Flannel> ademan: If they've locked down the computer so you can't download whatever programs you don't have and need, then they probably have the boot to HD only.
[01:11] <campbch> what is an alternative to the US repositories, if they're down? and how does one change them?
[01:11] <blakkinferno> Flannel:http://www.pastebin.it/2457
[01:11] <ademan> Flannel: i can download them, but if they've got an installer permissions are restricted and whatnot
[01:11] <kitche> campbch: just archieve.ubuntu.com
[01:11] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Thanks again for your help :3
[01:11] <Flannel> campbch: edit your sources list (gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list) and remove the us. prefix from all the URLs
[01:11] <mercykiller> campbch: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, remove the "us." in front of the urls
[01:11] <blakkinferno> Flannel: I am loving ubuntu because the people in the IRC are very helpful.
[01:11] <blakkinferno> Flannel: UBUNTU FTW ! :3
[01:12] <caccolangrifata> yeah
[01:12] <IndyGUnFreak> blakk, and we love helping
[01:12] <kitche> blakkinferno: by the way I m not a ubuntu user I use my own distro :)
[01:12] <blakkinferno> Yup :3
[01:12] <blakkinferno> kitche: GASP!
[01:12] <Flannel> blakkinferno: you've edited it all correctly.  'sudo apt-get update' from the terminal
[01:12] <blakkinferno> kitche: Thanks for your help then ^^.
[01:12] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Okay.
[01:12] <blakkinferno> kitche: Are all the distros really similar then
[01:13] <IndyGUnFreak> no.
[01:13] <blakkinferno> kitche: Or did you use to use ubuntu?
[01:13] <blakkinferno> IndyGunFreak: :O
[01:13] <IndyGUnFreak> they may "look" similar, ie, Gnome, KDE, or Xcfe desktop interface
[01:13] <IndyGUnFreak> but under the hood, there can be a lot of differences
[01:13] <blakkinferno> Flannel: grr!
[01:13] <kitche> blakkinferno: I tried ubuntu out for a few days, but pretty much you just have to learn distro specifics then you will know how each distro works
[01:14] <blakkinferno> kitche: I see.
[01:14] <blakkinferno> Flannel: It is still connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com
[01:14] <Flannel> ademan: there are better distros especially suited for live environments, if you're bent on going that route.  That will fit/etc on a 2GB usb drive (and then some)
[01:14] <blakkinferno> Flannel: After i run the apt update.
[01:14] <blakkinferno> Flannel: Like DURING the apt update.
[01:14] <blakkinferno> Flannel: After the security things
[01:15] <blakkinferno> Flannel: It says '99% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (146.137.96.15)] '
[01:15] <Discerer> Comrade_S there?
[01:15] <ademan> Flannel: any with a package manager?  I don't mind installing from source i'm very comfortable with it, but removing something you installed from source can be a pain in the ass, are there any that provide solutions for that?
[01:15] <blakkinferno> Flannel: So, the apt update won't finish.
[01:15] <blakkinferno> -.-
[01:15] <Comrade_S> Discerer:  http://pastey.net/2981
[01:15] <Comrade_S> Discerer:  follow that format
[01:15] <kitche> ademan: use checkinstall while building from source makes a .deb package
[01:16] <marquedios> blakkinferno: why don't you paste your /etc/apt/sources.list contents to a pastebin
[01:16] <ademan> kitche but if i'm not using a debian based distro...
[01:16] <kitche> ademan: for the other distros they usually have a way to make packages
[01:16] <blakkinferno> marquedios: I did ^^
[01:16] <marquedios> oh
[01:16] <marquedios> lol
[01:16] <Discerer> thanks
[01:17] <blakkinferno> marquedios: http://www.pastebin.it/2457
[01:17] <frying_fish> ademan: checkinstall is a good thing to use for compiling from source, makes things into debs that you can get rid of.
[01:17] <Discerer> dont understand why global failed but I will
[01:17] <marquedios> I see, must have missed it :P
[01:17] <frying_fish> if not using deb based system, then why ask in #ubuntu.
[01:17] <ademan> but do live distros even have package managers for the most part? knoppix does cause it's debian based right? but as far as dsl and puppylinux and slax...
[01:17] <blakkinferno> Bleh, sources.list is going stupid on me ^^
[01:17] <kitche> ademna: dsl is debian-based
[01:17] <frying_fish> knoppix will most likely use apt?
[01:17] <umista> hey i mount my raid drive!!!!!
[01:17] <blakkinferno> Oh well, i guess ill just wait till the us archive is back up
[01:17] <blakkinferno> my apt-update isn't working
[01:17] <blakkinferno> -.-
[01:18] <root> Whatr is the difference between running programs with "sh" or "./" ?
[01:18] <kitche> ademan: and with slax you just go to their website and get the modules and reburn your cd
[01:18] <kitche> puppy you can save packages right on the cd ademan since it's a multi-session cd
[01:18] <blakkinferno> HEY GOOD NEWS!
[01:18] <blakkinferno> Flannel:!!!!
[01:18] <blakkinferno> Flannel: It wouldnt apt-update

[01:19] <tanlaan> kitche: for how long?
[01:20] <marquedios> blakkinferno: you are using apt-get update right and not apt-update?
[01:20] <kitche> tanlaan: the subdomain is down but the archieve.ubuntu.com is up and running you will just have to edit your source.list
[01:20] <Comrade_S> tanlaan:  no one knows for how long
[01:20] <tanlaan> kitche: ok

[01:32] <kitche> borg: well you will have to do some searching but all of the options are in man xorg.conf
[01:32] <blakkinferno> kitche: I already made sure it didnt say that anywhere in soruces.llist
[01:32] <kitche> blakkinferno: are you saving your source.list?
[01:32] <blakkinferno> kitche: list*. AND IT DOESN't.
[01:32] <blakkinferno> kitche: yes.
[01:33] <blakkinferno> kitche: When i ran like "sudo aptitude install" stuff
[01:33] <blakkinferno> kitche: it doesn't connect to us.archive
[01:33] <kitche> blakkinferno: you have to update aptitude also
[01:33] <borg> kitche: i know all of the options are in there, but i dont know WHICH options are right for my radeon 9800, that is the problem
[01:33] <blakkinferno> kitche: But when i run apt-update itself
[01:33] <blakkinferno> kitche: yea, when i run apt update, it tries to connect to us.archive
[01:33] <aleka> anyhelp on how to change a hostname?/computername?
[01:33] <blakkinferno> kitche: so sudo apt-get update doesnt work
[01:33] <blakkinferno> kitche: cuz it tries to connect to us.archive
[01:33] <blakkinferno> kitche: is that the wrong command?
[01:34] <kitche> borg: look up the radeon news site don't know it's name only know nvnews
[01:34] <BackPacker> aleka: enter "hostname mybox" at a console
[01:34] <BackPacker> aleka: also, edit /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
[01:34] <jevangelo> is there a way to get an msn messanger client on ubuntu?
[01:34] <Zaehlas> Anyone know how to modify the NFS folders I'm sharing out without using the GUI shares -admin?  Going through the GUI, it's not letting me change the settings, I mean it does, I hit OK, and they revert to what they were before.
[01:34] <tanlaan> how do i change common icons? like lets say I want all of my .mp3 files to have a certain icon. That and how do I change the icons of drives? such as my CD rom drive or files system icon.
[01:34] <aleka> BackPacker: would that then be recognized at each startup?
[01:34] <conreyt> H3g3m0n: did ya try it?
[01:34] <borg> kitche: is that what it's called "radeon news" ?
[01:34] <BackPacker> aleka: it should be, yes
[01:34] <aleka> thank you
[01:34] <keegan_> Is the repository running really slow for everyone?
[01:34] <BackPacker> aleka: welcome
[01:35] <kitche> borg: not sure don't know if radeon has 3rd party site like what nvnews is
[01:35] <kitche> keegan_: which repo?
[01:35] <Zaehlas> keegan: us repositories are down.  change to the main servers, or edit your file to remove the us. in front of the repository addresses
[01:35] <keegan_> All of the Official Ubuntu Repositories
[01:35] <jevangelo> sorry for asking that question....
[01:35] <kitche> blakkinferno: that's the right command, but seems odd that it's still trying to get tot he us one
[01:35] <the_burk> kitche thnx i think i found it.. :)
[01:36] <jevangelo> it was pretty easy to find the answer myself
[01:36] <borg> kitche: ya they dont, there's nothing even remotely close to "radeon news" when i searched google
[01:36] <BackPacker> aleka: the other way is to use the Network tool in the System menu
[01:36] <blakkinferno> kitche: Although it says that while running the command itself
[01:36] <keegan_> I get an error saying it couldn't connect to it, then like 10 minutes later it downloads it out of nowhere
[01:36] <blakkinferno> kitche: It no longer connects to it with commands
[01:36] <BackPacker> aleka: look on the General tab
[01:36] <blakkinferno> kitche: It is using the changes
[01:36] <blakkinferno> kitche: I have wine from winehq now
[01:36] <blakkinferno> kitche: http://www.winehq.com/site/download-deb
[01:36] <blakkinferno> kitche: those worked
[01:37] <z0id> ok, is there anyway to strace init? or have it fork and thus end up with a pid != 1?
[01:37] <aleka> ty Backpacker.... am having to reinstall my ubuntu after accidentally writting over the partition... and xchat looks so different I don't even like it
[01:37] <blakkinferno> Bye everyone, gotta do homework. BLEH!
[01:37] <blakkinferno> kitche: Bye, gotta go do homework.
[01:37] <aleka> what is in the repos was an xchat-gnome...
[01:37] <blakkinferno> Meh, gotta make a fuggin poem for english.
[01:37] <blakkinferno> T_T
[01:38] <BackPacker> aleka: I used to use xchat a long time ago. Use Konversation now
[01:38] <aleka> ;)
[01:38] <kitche> aleka: yes there is xchat-gnome in the repos but remember it is not xchat
[01:38] <aleka> so many things i have to re-install...so many wikis and forum pages to read....
[01:38] <keegan_> So no one else is having problems with the Official Ubuntu Repositories?
[01:38] <aleka> kitche: sadly I can see that
[01:39] <orestyle5> I am
[01:39] <FliesLikeALap> can someone name another repo for me to use besides the us archive?
[01:39] <kitche> aleka: just saying just in case you go into #xchat and ask about it they'll bite your heard off :)
[01:39] <kitche> FliesLikeALap: archieve.ubuntu.com
[01:39] <keegan_> Thank god I thought I was the only now.
[01:40] <Comrade_S> aleka: just uninstall xchat-gnome leaving only the xhcat package
[01:40] <orestyle5> It just times out
[01:40] <Comrade_S> alef0:  do it in synaptic

[01:41] <keegan_> Like how long this downtime is going to be?
[01:41] <kitche> keegan_: you have to /topic yourself
[01:41] <kitche> keegan_: no one knows how long it will be down
[01:41] <Comrade_S> aleka:  personally, I odnt understand why that really simplified and dumbed xchat gui is included
[01:41] <keegan_> Well atleast I know whats going on now.
[01:41] <keegan_> Time to watch TV
[01:42] <conreyt> keegan_: when they're back up I'll race you... :_

[01:42] <draco> n8 leute
[01:42] <borg> TVtime works great with Beryl
[01:43] <kitche> Comrade_S: well xchat-gnome is a fork of xchat based on gnome's ideas
[01:43] <keegan_> My computer is a pos pentium 3...and my video card died so no beryl for me :'(
[01:44] <tanlaan> !icons

[01:46] <mseney> hotdog003, i was just going to ask the same thing
[01:46] <Comrade_S> kitche: I am starting to beleive why many people say gnome is treating the average user as dumb and dumbing down stuff. come on whats so complicated about regular xchat? | LjL : I know off-topic :)
[01:46] <princemackenzie> hotdog003, i am also having issues with us repositories
[01:46] <aleka> I want the server tab and channel tabs to be at bottom instead of right panel
[01:46] <mseney> apt-get update was hanging at "146.137.96.15:
[01:46] <hotdog003> Ok. Thanks, just checking, I bet they'll be up in maybe an hour or so
[01:46] <hotdog003> Me too
[01:47] <mseney> glad it's not just me heh
[01:47] <kitche> Comrade_S: xchat-gnome isn't really done by gnome it's done by a 3rd party it seems like
[01:47] <hotdog003> wow, this is rare... Thanks, bye
[01:47] <kitche> aleka: that might be in preferences
[01:47] <Comrade_S> aleka:  preferences,> tabs

[01:58] <RobNyc[] > can I read write to my vista partition ?
[01:58] <Jassossovinik> !ntfs
[01:58] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[01:58] <Jassossovinik> !fuse
[01:58] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[01:58] <RobNyc[] > Jassossovinik, is that a yes
[01:59] <Jassossovinik> RobNyc[] , yes - it;s not perfect, but there is a safe way to read/write to NTFS - but there will be a small numbere of files that it will say "i can't touch this safely so i will not touch it at all"
[01:59] <CzarAlex> my box is trying to send an email to a hotmail.com address but the connection is timing out. now its trying to reconnect every hour. how do I stop this?

[01:59] <kitche> RobNyc[] : I would say no since Vista probably uses a different version of ntfs then xp

[02:00] <justin420> hi all. anybody recommend a CD/DVD writing application for gnome for ubuntu edgy? when using k3b i get errors when i choose the default, "auto" writing mode and "DAO" writing mode. I am trying to make a ubuntu edgy install cd and another ISO cd. any ideas anybody?
[02:00] <RobNyc[] > Jassossovinik, thanks how about can i read my osx partition
[02:00] <tjb891> does anyone here know how to download pictures of a imageshack slideshow?
[02:00] <TGPO> justin420 use SAO
[02:00] <Jassossovinik> Hmm, RobNyc[]  i'm afraid I don't know anything about OSX paritions, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't default available.
[02:00] <dm> synic you there?
[02:00] <TGPO> justin420 insead of DAO

[02:03] <con-man> how do you switch to 24 bit color?
[02:03] <tanlaan> how do i switch to kde from gnome? isnt it like sudo apt-get install kde*something* and then sudo apt-get uninstall gnome*somthing*
[02:03] <kandinski> where do I configure my laptop so it suspends when I close the lid, but only when it is not hooked to the power? if line power is on, I want it to just turn off the screen, like it does out of the box)
[02:03] <dm> Anyone familiar with Ipod / Exaile stuff?
[02:03] <campbch> kde-desktop
[02:03] <con-man> how do you switch to 24 bit color?
[02:03] <TGPO> justin420 have you tried TAO?
[02:03] <tanlaan> cambch: is that the same for gnome?
[02:03] <tanlaan> campbch: the -desktop
[02:03] <Rossimo> how do i selectively remove debian packages
[02:03] <yanger> hmm, is edgy a little tricker with file associations? edgy by default starts mpg videos via totem. when i they to change it in the properties, it doesn't let me switch...
[02:04] <campbch> gnome-desktop
[02:04] <tanlaan> k thanks :D
[02:04] <campbch> not sure what it is for the others :( like edubuntu-desktop or something
[02:04] <campbch> xubuntu-desktop
[02:04] <justin420> TGPO: will try it right now! im trying to get a friend use to using windows xp to start using linux.
[02:04] <Rossimo> i thought it was ubuntu-desktop
[02:04] <madewokherd> yanger: works for me
[02:04] <campbch> did i say gnome? my bad
[02:04] <Rossimo> should be goobuntu-desktop if you ask me
[02:05] <campbch> :p
[02:05] <Rossimo> jk
[02:05] <tanlaan> wait, so i would type int ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop?
[02:05] <Phat32> Can anyone else connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com ???
[02:05] <tanlaan> not gnome and kde
[02:05] <Rossimo> i can't
[02:05] <madewokherd> yanger: you do need to click the radio button on the list instead of just selecting that item
[02:05] <kitche> Phat32: read the topic
[02:05] <tanlaan> Phat32: no noone can
[02:05] <Rossimo> would it have anything to do with the open DNS server attack?
[02:05] <yanger> madewokherd, yeah, i'm clicking the radio but does not select it ;/
[02:06] <campbch> let's make a grand unified ubuntu distrobution that allows you to choose which desktop you want at install
[02:06] <yanger> well, it highlights it, but does not select it

[02:06] <Phat32> ?
[02:06] <Rossimo> DVD style?
[02:06] <campbch> that was a misspell
[02:06] <campbch> yep dvd styl
[02:06] <campbch> e
[02:06] <kandinski> campbch: not on CD
[02:06] <kitche> Phat32: that's not the full topic

[02:06] <tanlaan> lol
[02:06] <campbch> poor cd :(
[02:06] <kitche> Rossimo: then rest of the repos would be down if it was due to that
[02:06] <Rossimo> but anyway, how I a force a single package to uninstall?
[02:06] <Phat32> I see
[02:06] <Rossimo> kitche: ah
[02:06] <Phat32> can I use a EU mirror
[02:07] <kitche> Phat32: you can use archieve.ubuntu.com
[02:07] <Phat32> Can anyone confirm this?
[02:07] <kitche> Phat32: it's in the topic so it's confirmed
[02:07] <Unshift> how do you set your domain name?
[02:07] <Phat32> sweet
[02:07] <TGPO> Phat32 you can only use the EU mirror if your in japan, otherwise you have to use the RU mirror
[02:08] <Rossimo> ru.archive.ubuntu.com?
[02:08] <justin420> TGPO: TAO does not work either; it told me to try using a lower burning speed; i have had no problems using the debian distro writing cd's with any writing mode selection, auto tao dao blah blah blah. try a lower speed i take it?
[02:08] <TGPO> justin420 looks like

[02:16] <merc> any way around it at the moment?
[02:17] <Pelo> this would be the problem I take it
[02:17] <linuzo> matthew_, Well I recently updated from dapper to edgy and azureus now says No SSL provider available
[02:17] <Pelo> nope
[02:17] <linuzo> so I dunno
[02:17] <hewhocutsdown> ok, think it's ok now; went to Preferences>Keyboard>Layout
[02:17] <matthew_> linuzo, hmmm, try sudo apt-get remove azureus
[02:17] <linuzo> I checked google and looks like alot of people have had that problem. .
[02:17] <linuzo> I have reinstalled it
[02:17] <matthew_> linuzo, then do a sudo apt-get install azureus
[02:17] <linuzo> removed and installed again same problem. .
[02:18] <matthew_> linuzo, hmm, no idea...sorry.
[02:18] <linuzo> yeah that's what I thought. .
[02:18] <linuzo> :S
[02:18] <hewhocutsdown> changed to U.S. English (a little confusing, as it unfolds into a couple bizarre settings, like U.S. English international with dead keys) and set it to default
[02:18] <kitche> Pelo: well he fixed it before you said anything :)

[02:18] <hewhocutsdown> a little trial and error and my keys have returned. many thanks
[02:18] <matthew_> I know...
[02:18] <justin420> TGPO: using TAO and a lower writing speed got me further than I have gotten before; but still didnt finish the cd. The only thing i have running is the xchat irc program; I feel I should have to choose a lower writing speed; especially since I dont have anything else running using my CPU or memory? Any other ideas besides trying something lower than 12x on a 16x drive and cd?
[02:18] <matthew_> linuzo, that's why I'm not much help...
[02:18] <kitche> the_burk: well crashing is due toa  bug in flash and firefox(mozilla, etc)
[02:18] <matthew_> lol
[02:19] <linuzo> lmao..
[02:19] <Pelo> kitche,  pray I never get op in here :-)
[02:19] <linuzo> it's ok ..
[02:19] <the_burk> kitche, yeah i read that .. so i try with base .. (32 bit mozilla + plugins)
[02:19] <TGPO> justin420 other than dropping to 8x and trying that, not a clue
[02:21] <Pelo> merc,  don't hold your breath, the canadian military is currently busy cleaning up the mess in afganistan
[02:21] <justin420> TGPO: dont really want to resort to using winblows xp to burning my ubuntu edgy install cd, and return to castle wolfenstein cd to get stuff to work; and feel i shouldnt have to drop to a lower speed since nothing else is running but will try 8x speed; even though it is slower than a retard trying to solve 2+2=?

[02:23] <SeamusLP> sindrum:  I've been having trouble connecting to the repositories tonight
[02:23] <lufi1> Is there a command that will easily install all the needed dependencies for a source package?
[02:23] <sindrum> ohh ok thank you
[02:23] <tanlaan> how do i get rid of gnome after installing kubuntu-desktop?
[02:23] <tonyyarusso> sindrum, SeamusLP: See the topic perhaps if you're US.
[02:24] <justin420> Pelo: Nope, although its what I have had to resort to in the past.  Ubuntu should do it just fine; in my opinion; but maybe not after what I have tried so far.
[02:24] <tanlaan> i tried "sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop
[02:24] <tanlaan> *"
[02:24] <bimberi> lufi1: sudo apt-get build-dep package
[02:24] <Pelo> lufi1,  that isn'T how dependencies work ,   ./configure will tell you which dependencies you need, but if it is available you are better off installing the package from synaptic
[02:24] <tanlaan> and that didnt work
[02:24] <Hexidigital> tanlaan: aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop  (aptitude resolves dependencies)
[02:24] <Hexidigital> *better
[02:24] <sindrum> ohh ok thank would make sense
[02:24] <sindrum> thanks
[02:24] <tanlaan> Hexidigital: ill try
[02:24] <tanlaan> brb
[02:25] <lufi1> Pelo: of course, i'd prefer using non-standard versions for some stuff though (i'm on dapper, some of the software is already getting stale)
[02:25] <lufi1> bimberi: thank you!
[02:25] <HoboMonkee> only time you ever want to build a package from source is if you 1.) don't have access to the package in the repos, 2.) the packages version in the repos is older than the current and you can not find a .deb file built for ubuntu
[02:25] <Vodan> Hey can I get some quick help?
[02:25] <HoboMonkee> or 3.) if you REALLY know wtf your doing and want to ignore 1 & 2
[02:25] <lufi1> or 3. i am just a meganerd who enjoys compiling:)
[02:25] <lufi1> :P
[02:25] <Pelo> Vodan,  only if you state your problem
[02:26] <Pelo> lufi1,  which package anyway ?
[02:26] <tanlaan> that did nothing
[02:26] <lufi1> Pelo: vlc
[02:26] <linuzo> haha utorrent under wine works pretty good. .
[02:26] <linuzo> would never have thought. .
[02:26] <tanlaan> i previously used "sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop" but gde/gnome is still there
[02:26] <Vodan> Well I couldn't start from the live cd, so i went to the alternative cd, and it installed normal, but when it restarted it says no operating system
[02:26] <HoboMonkee> dude, ya know what pisses me off
[02:26] <Pelo> linuzo,  do you want me to tell you how to skin it to match the desktop ?
[02:26] <umista> whts happening with project looking glass?
[02:26] <HoboMonkee> I can't get Shareaza to work under wine
[02:26] <tanlaan> i even told X that i wanted to use KDE by default

[02:27] <miles_> Hi
[02:27] <HoboMonkee> lufil, is nicotine+ in the repos?
[02:27] <tanlaan> when you do the switch from ubuntu to kubuntu, isnt there supposed to be a drastic change in what your desktop looks like?
[02:27] <lufi1> HoboMonkee: probably not...
[02:28] <miles_> Is it possible to export a web page into PDF using Firefox?
[02:28] <lufi1> HoboMonkee: it's a soulseek clone for linux
[02:28] <KalleRM> Hmm where do i find the firefox plugin folder in a new ubuntu 6.06 installation (messing with java installation)
[02:28] <Vodan> @tan yeah, ubuntu uses gnome and kubuntu uses KDE
[02:28] <HoboMonkee> ah yes
[02:28] <HoboMonkee> soulseek
[02:28] <tonyyarusso> miles_: You can print to pdf
[02:28] <lufi1> HoboMonkee: i just run it from /opt
[02:28] <lufi1> it's python, no compiling needed
[02:28] <miles_> Right, forgot about that
[02:28] <miles_> Thanks =)
[02:28] <bimberi> KalleRM: /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[02:28] <tanlaan> Vodan: well the thing is, im looking at it and it all looks the same, but there are all the Kubuntu apps in my applications list
[02:28] <KalleRM> Thx
[02:29] <Vodan> Well I couldn't start from the live cd, so i went to the alternative cd, and it installed normal, but when it restarted it says no operating system
[02:29] <KalleRM> HAve to fool a lot around in the filesystem :P
[02:29] <ss845567> hi all .. i need some help
[02:29] <KalleRM> Tooo many folders
[02:29] <HoboMonkee> Soulseek is a good network for music, but I like shareaza for it's good multi-network support
[02:29] <Vodan> try Ares
[02:29] <tanlaan> Hmm, maybe its because of my theme
[02:29] <Vodan> http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/
[02:29] <hou5ton> I have installed on my system, SMB4K.  It will not start as a user. I have to: sudo smb4k in a terminal. It is listed in the Applications menu though.  How can I make it such that when I click on the link in the Applications menu, it will basically respond the same as when I do sudo SMB4K in a terminal?
[02:30] <HoboMonkee> ...
[02:30] <HoboMonkee> your joking about Ares right
[02:30] <tanlaan> This is weird >.<, it looks as though i have a mixture of gnome and kde functioning togethor
[02:30] <Vodan> that gotta be a ram killer
[02:31] <G3N3SIS> How does remote desktop work?
[02:31] <errorlevel> I just need to find a good font for xchat.
[02:31] <tanlaan> Vodan: But I told X that I wanted KDE as my default, so I think im in KDE but under "system" there is "about gnome"
[02:31] <errorlevel> And I need to figure out how to disable this bloody spellchecker in xchat.
[02:32] <ss845567> i have a fat32 partition that i have mounted. the directory is owned by root group root. when i sudo and try to change the ownership of the partition and files in partition i get "operation not permitted" I am superuser and it wont let me change it
[02:32] <Vodan> you could just use kubuntu
[02:32] <G3N3SIS> How does remote desktop work?
[02:32] <Hexidigital> tanlaan: you can use both GUI's if you like
[02:32] <justin420> G3N3SIS: What do you mean how does remote desktop work? I can connect to my other Windows XP computers just fine?
[02:32] <Hexidigital> i'm trying to find the page i used to remove gnome
=== ss845567 is now known as Stumpyfoot
[02:32] <tanlaan> Hexidigital: Well i only want KDE lol
[02:32] <tanlaan> Vodan: techinically I know have Kubuntu, thats what i installed over ubuntu
[02:33] <KalleRM> Uh and what are the short key for paste
[02:33] <KalleRM> Hate my Ctrl + V not working :P
[02:33] <tanlaan> Vodan: it boots as Kubuntu, but when X is loaded it gives me the Ubuntu loading screen *after kubuntu login*
[02:33] <Vodan> idk
[02:33] <SuperQ> tanlaan: from the login screen, you want to select kde session
[02:33] <Hexidigital> tanlaan: www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde
[02:34] <tanlaan> SuperQ: ill try that
[02:34] <bimberi> KalleRM: it's ctrl-V mostly, but shift-ctrl-V in some places, eg. gnome-terminal
[02:34] <Hexidigital> control+shift+Insert sometimes, as well
[02:35] <tanlaan> brb
[02:35] <HoboMonkee> ya know what is pissing me off? I reinstaled ubuntu the other day using the latest Edgy DVD
[02:35] <HoboMonkee> and I have no sound :(
[02:35] <HoboMonkee> it see's my sound card and shit
[02:35] <Stumpyfoot> riiiiiggggghhhttt come here for help im told.. real nice thanks sooo much for your help (sarcasm)
[02:35] <KalleRM> Thx :P Why the shift :P
[02:35] <effraie> somebody here who know a bit about postfix and amavis?
[02:35] <G3N3SIS> I want to know how remote desktop works.
[02:35] <tanlaan> Hexidigital: can u send that link again?
[02:35] <G3N3SIS> It says  if I email the command that I will be able to get remote access.
[02:35] <Hexidigital> tanlaan: www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde
[02:35] <soro> :P
[02:36] <tanlaan> thanks
[02:36] <G3N3SIS> How does it receive the command.  Do I need to set any external stuff up?
[02:36] <Hexidigital> tanlaan: you have to use the Remove Ubuntu method
[02:36] <Hexidigital> bah.. too late
[02:36] <bimberi> G3N3SIS: Ubuntu's remote desktop is called vino-server and uses the VNC protocol.  You can use a VNC client on another PC to connect to it.
[02:37] <effraie> somebody here who know a bit about postfix and amavis?
[02:37] <G3N3SIS> Do I need the client to connect or?
[02:37] <SuperQ> effraie: a bit
[02:37] <jevangelo> has anyone ever tried to install packages and it says not authenticated, and wont download any packages?
[02:37] <justin420> G3N3SIS: Dont know anything about that; have you tried using Terminal Server Client in Applications > Internet > Terminal Server Client if your trying to connect to a Windows XP computer? That also works for me.
[02:37] <effraie> ok SuperQ
=== HoboMonkee is now known as MonkeeOfEvil
[02:37] <jevangelo> even when you have supplied the correct password?
[02:37] <MonkeeOfEvil> darr
[02:37] <MonkeeOfEvil> woops
[02:37] <G3N3SIS> thanks justin.
[02:37] <MonkeeOfEvil> lol
[02:37] <bimberi> G3N3SIS: (note that the package is called vino)
[02:38] <G3N3SIS> One more thing, has anyone got gmail to work in evolution?
[02:38] <justin420> G3N3SIS: np. :)
[02:38] <bimberi> !gmail | G3N3SIS
[02:38] <ubotu> G3N3SIS: gmail is a webmail service. For information on using it with Evolution see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingGmailWithEvolution
[02:38] <SuperQ> effraie: ?
[02:38] <effraie> SuperQ: MP?
[02:39] <effraie> oh, MP is french
[02:39] <borfborf> I need help... :(
[02:40] <Pelo> borfborf,  what with ?
[02:40] <bimberi> jevangelo: I've seen that as a warning, but it will let me install
[02:40] <effraie> SuperQ: do you see my private message?
[02:40] <borfborf> well
[02:41] <borfborf> I was having problems with my video...
[02:41] <jevangelo> can someone point me in the right direction about that?
[02:41] <bimberi> !enter
[02:41] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[02:41] <Pelo> borfborf,   don'T do itlike that ,  just write out your problem in one line
[02:41] <jevangelo> im pretty sure i can sort whatever it is  out, i just dont even know where to start
[02:41] <umista> ok whts up with my tiem
[02:41] <wubrgamer> hey guys
[02:41] <Pelo> borfborf,  you're gonna hve to do better then, that ,  what is the problem ?????
[02:41] <Pelo> hello wubrgamer
[02:42] <umista> time, its all ways out of snyc and tells me new zealand is +13 when it should be +12
[02:42] <wubrgamer> important ! i just *shift-deleted* my .mozilla directory in nautilus
[02:42] <wubrgamer> PLEASE tell me i can recover it !!!
[02:42] <borfborf> firstly, I am using kubuntu
[02:42] <borfborf> my video problem would fix itself if I restarted my system, but someone informed me that I can just kill the x process instead of restarting
[02:42] <wubrgamer> i've been building that profile for over three months...
[02:42] <wubrgamer> no way, it's been longer...i need it back
[02:42] <justin420> TGPO: It appears that using 8x and TAO mode worked for writing a Ubuntu edgy install cd; even though that is half of my actual writing speed; especially since I am not running anything else. That to me personally is awful disgusting; half the normal writing speed. But anyways; thanks for your help. Maybe ubuntu will work out that problem I hope :)
[02:42] <borfborf> but now I'm locked in the login page, every time I enter my pw I get thrown back there, no error messages
[02:42] <G3N3SIS> Alright, so now that i've configured G-mail Remote desktop tells me that the command if e-mailed will grant access.
[02:43] <Pelo> wubrgamer,  if you shift deleted it you are screwed,  that's why there is a little warning when you use shift del
[02:43] <G3N3SIS> Is this true?
[02:43] <wubrgamer> dammit
[02:43] <Pelo> borfborf,   username first,  password after,  also check that you don'T have caplocks enable
[02:43] <harry> does xubuntu has the feature cut copy and paste with the use of the mouse?
[02:44] <christian_> I am having a problem when i log off or switch terminals. My screen goes blank and I have to hard reset my computer
[02:44] <borfborf> pelo, the problem isn't that I'm entering my login info wrong, I put in my username and password as I normally do
[02:44] <borfborf> they get accepted, and it starts to log in, where the screen goes black, but after that it goes immediately back to the login screen
[02:45] <matthew_> harry, can you cut with the mouse?
[02:45] <harry> borfborf: sometimes i get that from elive
[02:45] <Pelo> borfborf,   that's not so much a video problem as a login one,  but I have no idea how to resolve it ,  and being in kubuntu you might want to try the #kubuntu
[02:45] <jrib> borfborf: ctrl-alt-f1, login, what does  'ls -l ~/.ICEauthority ~/.Xauthority'  say?
[02:45] <harry> matthew_ actually i'm on gnome. i just want to know
[02:45] <borfborf> jrib I would have to restart to tell you
[02:45] <jrib> borfborf: oh ctrl-alt-f7 brings you back by the way
[02:46] <borfborf> oh? okay
[02:46] <borfborf> I'd better write all this down
[02:46] <jrib> borfborf: ok, you could use screen in a terminal to speak with us too
[02:46] <jrib> s/screen/irssi ...
[02:46] <wubrgamer> exit
[02:46] <wubrgamer> exit
[02:47] <borfborf> hm...
[02:47] <borfborf> I'll have to try that, then
[02:47] <matthew_> harry, well, I don't know about cutting, but I can copy and paste only using the mouse button in kubuntu dapper
[02:48] <Cas_> How do I enable spell support in OO.o, should I download the dictionaries manually(through the wizard) or can I install something for it?
[02:48] <borfborf> okay, brb I guess
[02:48] <christian_> I am having a problem when i log off or switch terminals. My screen goes blank and I have to hard reset my computer
[02:49] <unclben> quick question: does anybody know if the newer gaim beta(s) are going to be backported to edgy?
[02:49] <kaiyang2> hi I have set up TightVNC on my server. but i am facing a problem that the VNC server wont start if i do not log into my account... is there a way to connect to a un-logon VNC server?
[02:50] <bimberi> Cas_: look for the appropriate myspell package for the desired language
[02:50] <Cas_> bimberi: hmmz, installed those :S
[02:50] <Cas_> bimberi: I will check some more options in OO.o itself
[02:51] <jrib> Cas_: make sure OO.o is using a language that has an "abc checkmark" next to it iirc
[02:51] <qsuc> is there an ubuntu distro that lets my ATi X700 work?
[02:52] <Pelo> !ati | qsuc
[02:52] <ubotu> qsuc: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:52] <borg> does xchat have an ident server?
[02:52] <christian_> Question:  I am having a problem when i log off or switch terminals. My screen goes blank and I have to hard reset my computer
[02:52] <qsuc> well, I can't even get ubuntu to boot, so how do I do that first? it crashes on the loading screen
[02:53] <Pelo> christian_,  how do you exit the terminal ?
[02:53] <Cas_> bimberi, jrib: found it, it was a default language setting. Thanks
[02:53] <fwap> does ubuntu force you to use a GUI or can you close it down to use virtual consoles?
[02:53] <Pelo> qsuc,  try the alternate install cd
[02:53] <christian_> ctrl-alt-#
[02:53] <christian_> it happens when going from GUI to terminal mode
[02:53] <bimberi> Cas_: cool, well done :)
[02:54] <christian_> or when i log off or shutdown
[02:54] <ortega10> is there any easy way to find out and/or change my color depth (16 / 32 bpp) in ubuntu?
[02:54] <Pelo> christian_,  try just clicking the X in the title bar or  typing exit
[02:54] <qsuc> thanks pelo!
[02:54] <christian_> its not in gnome. when i say terminal i mean tty
[02:54] <Pelo> ortega10,  system > prefs > screen resolution
[02:55] <ortega10> Pelo: it doesn't show up there
[02:55] <christian_> i cant switch to a different tty without the screen going blank
[02:55] <bimberi> fwap: you can stop the gui starting with 'sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove' (which will stop gdm from being started at boot time)
[02:55] <borg> where can i install an ident server?
[02:55] <borfborf> I have both files, ICEauthority and Xauthority
[02:55] <Pelo> borg,   #xchat
[02:55] <christian_> it also goes blank when I log off, restart, etc
[02:55] <ortega10> Pelo: check it out http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/3148/screenmh0.png
[02:56] <errorlevel> Pelo: That does not have anything to do with xchat.  xchat doesn't require ident servers.  Merely some IRC servers require them.
[02:56] <Pelo> ortega10,  my mistake you are correct
[02:56] <borfborf> who was I talking to before, sorry! I forget your name... jrib?
[02:56] <ortega10> Pelo: no prob but where then?  :)
[02:57] <Pelo> ortega10,  do you need to switch frequently or do you jsut want to set a new one ?
[02:57] <bimberi> borfborf: are they owned by your username?
[02:57] <ortega10> Pelo: i'd like to be able to switch frequently, but i'll take just switch it if that's all i can do
[02:57] <borfborf> yeah, bimberi
[02:58] <Eclypse> hey all, I copied a dvd to my hard drive with dvd shrink, what can I use to burn it and be playable in a DVD player?
[02:58] <Pelo> ortega10,  you can always try editing xorg.conf ,    sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:58] <Eclypse> would data dvd in gnomebaker work?
[02:58] <bimberi> borfborf: hmmk. probably not _that_ issue then (sometimes those files become owned by root) :|
[02:58] <Pelo> Eclypse,   GNOMEBAKER
[02:58] <borfborf> bimberi: nod :\ thank you though
[02:59] <Eclypse> pelo, will data dvd option work?
[02:59] <borfborf> well I'll ask in kubuntu at any rate
[02:59] <Pelo> yes
[02:59] <Eclypse> pelo, thanks
[02:59] <Pelo> sorry for the caps btw
[02:59] <ortega10> Pelo: ok thanks, but is there any other way?
[02:59] <Eclypse> pelo, it's fine.
[02:59] <Pelo> ortega10,  not that I know of , which means nothing btw
[02:59] <yanger> hmm, i'm unsure how I should phrase this when searching online... i was adding some gdesklets to my desktop, and suddenly, X crashed and rebooted, when I tried to log in, it loaded, the sound played, but the loading ticker that displays in the middle didn't appear, nor did anything else... any ideas how to fix?
[02:59] <ortega10> Pelo: ok thanks anyway
[03:01] <yanger> i am running edgy and composite is disabled.
[03:02] <jrib> borfborf: you should try creating a new user and see if it happens with that user
[03:02] <borfborf> jrib, I'm not sure how to create one
[03:03] <jrib> borfborf: sudo adduser new_username
[03:03] <borfborf> I'm very very new to this, I only installed it within the last few days
[03:03] <borfborf> nod
[03:03] <borfborf> hm
[03:03] <borfborf> I guess I will try that
[03:03] <justin420> anybody happen to know how to disable agpgart and use nvagp instead on edgy???
[03:03] <borfborf> thanks!

[03:06] <cafilubu> I am a nob in ubuntu

[03:18] <yanger> ack brb
[03:18] <fiendskull9> infact it seems almost anything that goes outward ethernet doesnt work
[03:18] <fiendskull9> but all my server services are fine
[03:18] <borfborf> jrib: when I try to login under my main account, it starts to login but then stops and returns to the login screen
[03:18] <GenNMX> Firefishe: Edgy or Dapper?
[03:18] <justin420> RoC_MM_0w: did you edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to use nvidia instead of nv under the Device section for driver? and restart gdm? other than that I have no other ideas.
[03:18] <Firefishe> GenNMX: Dapper
[03:18] <agent> is it possible to switch between charsets when typing?
[03:18] <borfborf> jrib: when I try to login under any of the usernames I just created, it tells me that the user name/password was wrong
[03:19] <Pests> Gen: I know, I have been searching for the last day or so but I just wanted to hear some first hand accounts.
[03:19] <jrib> borfborf: I see, are you sure you just didn't make a typo or caps lock?
[03:19] <GenNMX> Firefishe: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=dapper+sources.list&btnG=Google+Search has some hopefuls.
[03:19] <borg> y'all should put the word "repository" in the topic to help us n00bs not be confused or miss the message entirely
[03:19] <princemackenzie> !rbox
[03:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rbox - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:19] <GenNMX> Pests: Should be no problem except the wireless card, not sure if Ubuntu will be able to set that up by itself.
[03:20] <viator> why do none of the desklets in gdesklets work?
[03:20] <borfborf> jrib: yeah, but I also tried making ones without passwords
[03:20] <green_earz> Firefishe: you can use apt-setup to pick a repos, sudo apt-setup and pick a http repos
[03:20] <viator> well the weather desklets dont for some reason
[03:20] <borfborf> jrib: they didn't work -- so either there's a default password I don't know, or making logins just didn't work for some reason
[03:20] <Firefishe> thank you

[03:21] <fiendskull9> RobNyc, hey you crazy cat ;)
[03:21] <justin420> fiendskull9: dont have any firewalls running do you? if so I dont know; i did a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade twice and everything was sort of ok. the only issues i had was a parallel printer issue and vmware running in general issue; other wise everything worked. are you sure you internet connection is working?
[03:21] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, hehe
[03:21] <RobNyc> whats up
[03:21] <viator> nobody knows?
[03:21] <viator> hmmmm
[03:21] <Pests> Gen: Found one person saying it works fine as eth1. Im just worried about my alternatives if it does not work however.
[03:21] <fiendskull9> RobNyc, sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/yourpartition /mnt/osx
[03:21] <fiendskull9> ;)
[03:21] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, thats it ?
[03:21] <fiendskull9> yep
[03:21] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, but you can only read hfs part right
[03:22] <fiendskull9> if its journaled
[03:22] <fiendskull9> turn off journaling with diskutil
[03:22] <fiendskull9> and then its RW

[03:23] <dsnyders> Hi all.  I'm looking for partitioning recommendations:  Sizes, what goes where, etc.  Everything in one partition has cost me a weeks worth of reconstruction efforts and some very important files. (No, I didn't back them up.)
[03:23] <Pests> The current ubuntu install disk also acts as a live cd does it not?
[03:23] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, i wanna set up my fstab to automount my hfs =)
[03:24] <kitche> Pests: the desktop install cd does
[03:24] <Pests> kitche: kk, thanks.
[03:24] <fiendskull9> RobNyc, well partition type is hfsplus
[03:25] <b0ss_> i just fixed my problem
[03:25] <b0ss_> added noapic beofre -- in boot directive
[03:25] <wsjunior> im running ubuntu in amd64, why azureus doesnt work?
[03:25] <Firefishe> GenNMX: Here is my current /etc/apt/sources.list, at this link:  http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/pUm0AX57.html  Might you give a brief critique.
[03:25] <Pests> Are there torrent download links anywhere?
[03:25] <the_burk> wsjunior, there is a problem with java on amd64
[03:25] <justin420> well l8r yall. its time to get stoned and play some doom3 and quake4. yall have phun. cya another time.
[03:25] <kitche> wsjunior: did you install java?
[03:26] <bruenig> Firefishe, I can confirm that the us repos aren't working at least not for me. I changed mine to uk and I was able to get what I needed
[03:26] <Cas> dsnyders: that's very personal and depends on your needs and use of the system. I like to have my /home and /var separate because I put all my files in there so they don't fill up my root system. Also because I like to have those partitions encrypted(I have a laptop).
[03:26] <wsjunior> kitche: i installed azureus using synaptic
[03:26] <wsjunior> the_burk: i installed it using synaptic

[03:26] <b0ss_> wine can run win32 services yes?
[03:27] <bruenig> Firefishe, well I am on edgy myself
[03:27] <b0ss_> and install .exe
[03:27] <kitche> wsjunior: well that didn't really answer my question but azureus doesn't really like gnu java
[03:27] <wsjunior> kitche: http://rafb.net/paste/results/uudEPT73.html
[03:27] <Firefishe> bruenig: ah.. i c
[03:27] <kitche> b0ss_: well wine is used to install windows programs
[03:27] <the_burk> wsjunior, java? o0r just the azerus package?
[03:27] <wsjunior> kitche: thats what i get when i try to run it
[03:27] <b0ss_> oo

[03:27] <rance1> I need some netorking help with ubuntu 6.06 LTS server, could someone take a look at http://www.pastebin.us/9320 I've listed my problems there
[03:27] <bruenig> Firefishe, to change to uk, you can just run this command, sudo sed 's/us./uk./g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list
[03:27] <Cas> dsnyders: there are many recommendations about this matter, but they are more about the minimal sizes. try googling or look in google goups for some good reasons
[03:28] <wsjunior> kitche: what does that means?
[03:28] <wsjunior> the_burk: do u know what is going on?
[03:28] <umista> wht do i need to run vmware, like wht program?
[03:28] <b0ss_> so if i get wine i can run cs
[03:28] <borfborf> I think I'll just install xp until I get my other computer running and can tool around with this one as a spare... :(
[03:28] <b0ss_> and games and stuff
[03:29] <ski-worklap> isit just me or is us.archive.ubuntu.com down?
[03:29] <the_burk> umista, vmware and the os you want?
[03:29] <kitche> wsjunior: try install java since azureus doesn't like gnj
[03:29] <umista> windows need to study
[03:29] <taan> hi, i got ubuntu installed, all latest updates, and using nvidia 5200 with latest ubuntu drivers for it... but UI is quite slow. any ideas why (winxp under vmware is snappier)
[03:29] <b0ss_> us arvhives
[03:29] <b0ss_> are down.
[03:29] <borfborf> thank you jrib and others who tried to help me!
[03:29] <bruenig> ski-worklap, yes I believe it is
[03:29] <kitche> b0ss_: yes everyone knows it's even in the topic
[03:29] <Pests> Are there any offical ubuntu torrents?
[03:29] <dsnyders> Cas, I am googling.  I came across some sort of recommendation a while ago, and I can't find it now.
[03:29] <bruenig> Pests, yes there are on the download page of ubuntu.com
[03:29] <b0ss_> mmmmmmmmmk
[03:29] <ski-worklap> hmm
[03:29] <b0ss_> cus i dont need windows..
[03:30] <the_burk> wsjunior, install real java as kitche said .. or install blackice java .. might be better because you have amd64 ..
[03:30] <ski-worklap> there should be a way to specify fallback sites in sources.list
[03:30] <b0ss_> im tired of damm windows.
[03:30] <wsjunior> kitche: which package exactly should i install?
[03:30] <bruenig> ski-worklap, sudo sed 's/us./uk./g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list will change it to uk mirrors
[03:30] <wsjunior> the_burk: whats the name of the package for it?
[03:30] <rance1> I went to the vmware web site, downloaded vmware server free and then followed the directions at http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_vmware_server and didnt have any trouble
[03:30] <Wonderl00t> hello im using ubuntu edgy and its awesome! qucik question guys: Whats the easiest way to get ubuntu to read/write to my ntfs partitions?
[03:30] <ski-worklap> bruenig, yeah i just did that for ca
[03:30] <kitche> !java|wsjunior make sure your not using the us.archieve.ubuntu.com repos you will need to use uk or another one
[03:30] <ubotu> wsjunior make sure your not using the us.archieve.ubuntu.com repos you will need to use uk or another one: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[03:31] <krups> wonderl00t - write not supported.
[03:31] <ski-worklap> point is i don't much care where i get my packages from, i should be able to say {us || ca || uk}.archive.ubuntu.org
[03:31] <dsnyders> Cas, I definitely want to have my /home on a separate partition, if not on a separate drive.
[03:31] <Pests> I cannot seem to be able to find the torrent links =/
[03:32] <koolatron> I think i managed to screw up sudo - when trying to execute something, I get asked for my password, but nothing I do seems to affect anything and i don't get console output.
[03:32] <b0ss_> apt getting wine
[03:32] <koolatron> i accidentally blew away my supplementary groups

[03:32] <green_earz> Pests: torrent link for what ?
[03:33] <fiendskull9> i got a networking prob
[03:33] <koolatron> what are the default supp. groups?  and how can i restore them?  boot into single-user mode?
[03:33] <fiendskull9> my server cant resolve any other servers

[03:33] <wsjunior> kitche: thats for 32bit
[03:33] <Pests> Thanks bru.
[03:33] <fiendskull9> so pinging anything doesnt work, and i cant apt-get anything
[03:33] <kitche> wsjunior: you on x86_64?
[03:33] <wsjunior> kitche: yes!
[03:33] <bruenig> Pests, the setup is a bit confusing, I don't know why they changed it.
[03:34] <fiendskull9> java still wont work on those x86 emulated AMD's
[03:34] <bruenig> Pests, by setup I mean the way the webpage is setup
[03:34] <g0tw00d> can someone help me with my source.list file....I think I have something wrong
[03:34] <Pests> Ah, yeah.
[03:34] <Pests> Sorry for the hassle.
[03:34] <bruenig> g0tw00d, what is the problem
[03:34] <Wonderl00t> krups: thanks would you recommennd using ntfs-3g? any risks to damaging partitions/files?
[03:34] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, but isnt journalied w/e it is good though for osx
[03:34] <fiendskull9> it wont allow R/W from linux then
[03:34] <g0tw00d> im trying to run apt-get install openssh-server
[03:34] <fiendskull9> RobNyc, all it does it makes tiny backups of open documents here and there
[03:35] <fiendskull9> its not useful unless your using OSX for _real_ working :P
[03:35] <bruenig> g0tw00d, and...?
[03:35] <kitche> wsjunior: think sun has x86_64 on their website
[03:35] <g0tw00d> and I uncommented the two lines out I think
[03:35] <g0tw00d> but it says package missing
[03:35] <fiendskull9> RobNyc, and i thought'd you'd have learned from carlitos that unstable is the VLOS way ;)
[03:35] <bruenig> !info openssh-server
[03:35] <ubotu> openssh-server: Secure shell server, an rshd replacement. In component main, is optional. Version 1:4.3p2-5ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 212 kB, installed size 552 kB
[03:35] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, what u mean
[03:35] <TGPO> g0tw00d try apt-get install ssh
[03:35] <bruenig> g0tw00d, pastebin your sources.list
[03:35] <bruenig> !paste
[03:35] <fiendskull9> RobNyc, dont worry about it
[03:35] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[03:35] <rance1> g0tw00d, if you are following the hint I listed on the vmware install, you might neet to wait till the pachage mirror comes back online
[03:36] <ski-worklap> hmm
[03:36] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, lol
[03:36] <ski-worklap> how do i tell totem to piss off and let mplayer-plugin handle multimedia in ffox?
[03:36] <fiendskull9> RobNyc, if you want to Read and write to your osx partition from linux, then you need to disable the OSX86's journaling
[03:36] <fiendskull9> from inside osx
[03:36] <RobNyc> so let me go boot into osx and i'll see if i can turn it off
[03:36] <g0tw00d> nope.. didnt work
[03:36] <bruenig> ski-worklap, sudo apt-get remove totem-mozilla
[03:37] <g0tw00d> someone earlier told me that was how i installed it
[03:37] <ski-worklap> dpkg: dependency problems prevent removal of totem-mozilla: ubuntu-desktop depends on totem-mozilla.
[03:37] <RobNyc> fiendskull9, so journaling is not needed
[03:37] <fiendskull9> no
[03:37] <g0tw00d> im not following any guide
[03:37] <the_burk> ski-worklap, : thats ok
[03:37] <borg> got wood? lol nice name
[03:37] <ski-worklap> yeah that's just annoying
[03:37] <ski-worklap> should be a diversion/alternative situation
[03:37] <g0tw00d> :p
[03:37] <bimberi> !ubuntu-desktop | ski-worklap
[03:37] <ubotu> ski-worklap: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[03:37] <g0tw00d> thx
[03:37] <highneko> ski-worklap: sudo apt-get remove totem-gstreamer-firefox-plugin; sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
[03:38] <adam> hey everybody
[03:38] <bruenig> ski-worklap, sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop
[03:38] <koolatron> Okay, so, I know what the problem is - how do I restore my groups if I managed to blow them away?  I think I need to log into single-user mode
[03:38] <g0tw00d> also when I open my add/remove i get errors trying to get the sources
[03:38] <fiendskull9> how do i configure my DNS servers to use through a shell
[03:38] <bruenig> g0tw00d, yeah the us mirrors are down
[03:38] <adam> got a question since my forum post hasn't been answered and it keeps getting knocked down the list haha

[03:41] <adam> yesterday there was a compiz update...ever since I installed it any programs that use 3d acceleration have slowed down a bit...and the rotating desktop cube (XGL) rotates REALLY FAST now...and the taskbar at the bottom shows only 2 desktop windows instead of 4
[03:41] <the_burk> taan using compiz or xgl?
[03:42] <kitche> adam: probably your configu has changed
[03:42] <taan> burk, no, nothing like that

[03:42] <the_burk> tan what is slow?? 2 sec fad or 2 minutes?

[03:47] <rance1> I dont think so, you could edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change the mirrors to uk or something like that
[03:47] <taan> burk, dont recall, either 2 or 4 gb
[03:47] <the_burk> sgorilla80, .. right now.. none.. :P

[03:48] <kitche> sgorilla80: all the mirrors are the same pretty much
[03:48] <tiptip> littie question, when i write "glxinfo | grep rendering" it doesnt do anything just moving to the next line (same as pressing enter). does it mean i have a proglem with my video driver ?
[03:48] <sgorilla80> im going to use the canadians
[03:48] <rance1> just the timing of the sync so they all could be slightly different
[03:48] <sgorilla80> there servers are usually fast in the us
[03:48] <sgorilla80> *their
[03:48] <taan> burk, yes, i dont see anything that stands out, no big EE or something like that
[03:49] <Rug> Howdy all
[03:49] <sgorilla80> is there information on the web of why they went down?
[03:49] <adam> and after installing the compiz update running "glxinfo | grep rendering" reports that there is no direct rendering...what happened
[03:49] <rance1> if they are all down, its got to be a round-robin dns problem of some kind
[03:49] <kitche> sgorilla80: probably not but there has been a huge DoS attack on the internet

[03:56] <tiptip> when i write "glxinfo | grep rendering" it doesnt do anything just moving to the next line (same as pressing enter). does it mean i have a proglem with my video driver ?
[03:57] <ChrisBradley> ok go...I'm downloading the 64 bit desktop disc to go with the 64 bit server

=== s|k is now known as me
[03:57] <adam> why does glxinfo report my vendor string as SGI instead of nvidia...and how can I fix that
=== me is now known as s|k
[03:58] <Rug> sc4ttrdbrain: #1) include the persons name you are talking to.  #2) that doesn't matter.  #3) to find out type:  uname -r at the console.
[03:58] <tiptip> Haxality , here : https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/hardware.html  they wrote it sould write "ok"
[03:58] <the_burk> taan, i need to check howto check the framebuffer... but what drivers are you using nvidias or nv?
[03:58] <taan> nvidia
[03:58] <the_burk> taan: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[03:58] <lucas9000> anyone using 32 bit opera on edgy 6.10 amd64?
[03:58] <noelferreira> how can i change a partition permissions?
[03:58] <rance1> !opera
[03:58] <ubotu> opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[03:58] <ciscosurfer> How can I get a Marvell Yukon 88E8056 Gigabit Ethernet Controller working?
[03:59] <Rug> sc4ttrdbrain: You need to install the kernel that matches your CPU to get it to work
[03:59] <jevangelo> why does add/remove... say that it's not authenticated
[03:59] <sc4ttrdbrain> Rug:  sorry,as i told u before, im on windows now(ubuntu is at home), the kernel is 2.6.17 (maybe)
[03:59] <jevangelo> it wont allow me to install anything anymore
[03:59] <taan> burk, that page only says howto install it, i want to confirm wheather or not it (direct fb) is working correctly
[04:00] <the_burk> taan: more orless do an sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg mark the nvidia and check the frameburrer
[04:00] <Rug> sc4ttrdbrain: ok, install the right kernel & everything will be fine
[04:00] <sc4ttrdbrain> Rug: :so what to do , coz im sure i have the right kernel
[04:00] <jspiro> hi all, what is the usual procedure for creating PDF files from Ubuntu apps?
[04:00] <lucas9000> i installed opera, but when i click on it in applications>internet nothing happens...any suggestions?
[04:00] <Rug> sc4ttrdbrain: one sec.  Let me check
[04:00] <Lupper> is anyone else having trouble accessing us.archive.ubuntu.com?  it seems to be down
[04:00] <ciscosurfer> Lupper: it is
[04:00] <jspiro> lucas9000, use firefox or konqueror :)
[04:00] <kitche> lucas9000: try starting it from command line
[04:01] <Lupper> ciscosurfer: thanks.  any ETA on when it's gonna be back up?
[04:01] <the_burk> taan: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and make sure the use kernel framebuffer is marked
[04:01] <ciscosurfer> Lupper: change to a different mirror or simply delete the "us." part
[04:01] <ciscosurfer> Lupper: no clue
[04:01] <lucas9000> jspiro: i usually use firefox, but i'm trying out opera to see if flash will actually work :)
[04:01] <jspiro> lucas9000, so just ask for help on fixing flash.
[04:01] <lucas9000> kitche: i'm enough of a n00b to not know how to do that
[04:01] <taan> ok, gonna try that now
[04:01] <Lupper> ciscosurfer: so i can just change my sources.list and synaptic should pull down the package i need?
[04:01] <Rug> sc4ttrdbrain: do:  sudo apt-cache search 2.6.15-27-686  that will show you the kernel you need.
[04:01] <kitche> lucas9000: open up a console and type opera should output the error
[04:01] <misterph3r> How come I don't have an xorg.conf file? :[
[04:01] <lucas9000> kitche: ok will do brb
[04:02] <ciscosurfer> Lupper: yes.  you might find this page handy: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[04:02] <Lupper> ciscosurfer: thanks
[04:02] <bimberi> misterph3r: where are you looking?
[04:02] <ciscosurfer> Lupper: sure
[04:02] <sc4ttrdbrain> Rug: what do you mean  the right kernel, its the default kernel from ubuntu(i think).Ok i ll try that when i get to ubuntu, but is there any config file sor sumthing?
[04:02] <misterph3r> bimberi: /etc/X11/
[04:02] <lucas9000> kitche: here's what i got: ERROR: ld.so: object 'libjvm.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
[04:02] <lucas9000> ERROR: ld.so: object 'libawt.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.

[04:02] <ciscosurfer> Does anyone know how can I get a Marvell Yukon 88E8056 Gigabit Ethernet Controller working?
[04:02] <Dial_tone> is there any sort of gnome macro recorder applet? where I can use a few keystrokes to type an address or something?
[04:03] <kitche> !paste|lucas9000
[04:03] <ubotu> lucas9000: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:03] <kitche> lucas9000: your missing some dependencies
[04:03] <Rug> sc4ttrdbrain: nope, just install the correct kernel for your hardware and HT should/will work for you.  Nothing else to edit
[04:03] <lucas9000> i will use pastebin next time sorry about that
[04:03] <sc4ttrdbrain> Rug: :thenks
[04:03] <ArrenLex> ciscosurfer: It wasn't automatically detected at install? That is surprising.
[04:03] <Rug> sc4ttrdbrain: np
[04:03] <bimberi> misterph3r: that's the right place, sorry no idea
[04:03] <sycho> Anyone know is how I can set Pan Newsreader up to download (save attachments) more then 1 file at a time?
[04:03] <lucas9000> kitche: do i just look for the ones mentioned in the error message in synaptic?
[04:03] <misterph3r> bimberi: Alright, thanks.
[04:04] <g0tw00d> is it possible to install ssh server?  I have tried apt-get install openssh-server, which is what I was told.....
[04:04] <bimberi> misterph3r: what version of Ubuntu?
[04:04] <ciscosurfer> I'm asking for a friend who is having this problem....coincidentally, I also have this NIC but I use another one that's installed b/c it works insead of the Marvel one
[04:04] <g0tw00d> it says it isnt avaiable
[04:04] <misterph3r> How can I check if Ubuntu was installed properely?
[04:04] <kitche> lucas9000: yes the libjvm is for java
[04:04] <bimberi> g0tw00d: put your sources.list on a pastebin
[04:04] <ciscosurfer> ArrenLex: I'm asking for a friend who is having this problem....coincidentally, I also have this NIC but I use another one that's installed b/c it works insead of the Marvel one
[04:04] <g0tw00d> and list openssh-client and ssh-askpass-gnome
[04:04] <taan> burk, should i include v4l module ?
[04:04] <misterph3r> bimberi: I'm not sure, how can I check?
[04:04] <lucas9000> kitche: ok i will try that brb...thanks
[04:04] <ethos> Can anybody tell me how I would go about applying this patch? http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/S3switch#Bugs.2FCaveats
[04:04] <ciscosurfer> ArronLex: and no, it doesn't get recognized.  This is also a problem in some other distros I've heard
[04:04] <bimberi> !version | misterph3r
[04:04] <ubotu> misterph3r: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[04:05] <ArrenLex> ciscosurfer: I have a Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8053 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller and it WorksForMe(tm).
[04:05] <ciscosurfer> ArronLex: really.  that's interesting.
[04:05] <the_burk> taan if your not using any video camcorders or something.. you should probably not need it..
[04:05] <jspiro> anyone here can walk misterph3r thru the use of cruft(1)?
[04:05] <x-r00t-x> !automatix
[04:05] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[04:05] <misterph3r> Release is 4.10
[04:05] <kitche> misterph3r: you mean 6.10?
[04:05] <bimberi> misterph3r: you have warty, which used xfree86 and not xorg
[04:05] <bimberi> *uses
[04:05] <jevangelo> http://us.archive.ubuntu.com is down
[04:05] <bimberi> :)
[04:06] <lucas9000> kitche: can't find libjvm.so in synaptic
[04:06] <jevangelo> i cant install anything
[04:06] <taan> burk, i though it is used for output of video, for vlc, no?
[04:06] <the_burk> !worksforme
[04:06] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[04:06] <ciscosurfer> ArrenLex: It's been a while since I've tried using the Marvell NIC so maybe it'll work now...I'll tell my friend to give it go again.
[04:06] <jspiro> misterph3r, is your computer messed up?
[04:06] <kitche> !java|lucas9000
[04:06] <ubotu> lucas9000: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[04:06] <mash> jevangelo: is it ok to use archive.ubuntu.com instead?
[04:06] <misterph3r> bimbri: I can't get 6.10 to install I get a dbus error.
[04:06] <kitche> lucas9000: you want sun-java5-jre
[04:06] <jspiro> misterph3r, which error?
[04:06] <kitche> jevangelo: yeah we know it's even in the topic
[04:06] <jevangelo> oh
[04:06] <lucas9000> kitche: i already have that installed
[04:06] <noelferreira> hi people hi want to mount a partition with permissons for all users
[04:07] <jevangelo> i thought something was wrong with my box
[04:07] <mash> kitche: is it ok to use archive.ubuntu.com instead?
[04:07] <noelferreira> how can i do that?
[04:07] <bimberi> misterph3r: have you tried the alternate CD?
[04:07] <Moosejaw> hi all
[04:07] <jspiro> hi all, what is the usual procedure for creating PDF files from Ubuntu apps?
[04:07] <Moosejaw> i am so happy i switched from windows to ubuntu!!!
=== mydy is now known as aBiNg
[04:07] <kitche> mash: yeah or use ca.archieve.ubuntu.com
[04:07] <ciscosurfer> ArrenLex: actually mine is a  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8050 PCI-E ASF Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 17)
[04:07] <mash> thanks.
[04:07] <misterph3r> jspiro: It usally just freezes, let me look.
[04:07] <KeeganX> If I use another repo will it work in automatix?
[04:07] <Wonderl00t> Hello everyone! a silly question from a 'nix n00b, where do i find the binaries or executables for installed packages?
[04:07] <Moosejaw> can anyone tell me if my laptop gfx card, radeon x1400 works with compiz/xgl?
[04:08] <jevangelo> i went from gentoo to ubuntu
[04:08] <ArrenLex> ciscosurfer: *shrug* I guess I just got lucky.
[04:08] <misterph3r> bimberi: The alternate is a live CD. Is it possible to just upgrade to 6.10.
[04:08] <ArrenLex> jevangelo: Good choice. Life is too short to run gentoo.
[04:08] <cwmajors> Keegan - you won't get support for automatix here...
[04:08] <jspiro> Moosejaw, which package?
[04:08] <jevangelo> hah
[04:08] <jspiro> oops
[04:08] <jspiro> Wonderl00t, which package?
[04:08] <strabes>  Moosejaw:  yes x1400 works with XGL, not AIGLX
[04:08] <Moosejaw> hrm...
[04:08] <mash> i have had problems with stability of x since my upgrade to edgy eft
[04:08] <ciscosurfer> ArrenLex: I'm checking some pages on the Net right now to confirm that this is actually a problem people are having
[04:08] <jevangelo> unless you just absolutely love to spend your free time compiling source
[04:08] <Moosejaw> i tried setting up the xgl
[04:08] <g0tw00d> bimberi: pastebin seems to be down
[04:08] <strabes>  Moosejaw:  I would recommend using BERYL though
[04:08] <Moosejaw> but dont think i didt it right
[04:08] <Moosejaw> ahh
[04:08] <strabes> Moosejaw: wiki.beryl-project.org
[04:08] <Moosejaw> i also tried beryl...but is it an alternative to gnome?
[04:09] <mash> was totally stable under drake.  now i get unexplained crashes (seemingly random).  keyboard, mouse both dead.
[04:09] <kitche> Moosejaw: beryl is an alternative to compiz
[04:09] <Moosejaw> ok...
[04:09] <Moosejaw> it seems when i tried to choose beryl, it didnt work
[04:09] <strabes> Moosejaw: no, it's the newer _better_ fork of compiz
[04:09] <jspiro> mash, so don't use edgy :)
[04:09] <bimberi> misterph3r: it would be better to install 6.10 from scratch, using its alternate cd which has the text-mode installer
[04:09] <Moosejaw> so i will try to reinstall i guess
[04:09] <strabes> Moosejaw: then you didn't do it correctly :)
[04:09] <mash> jspiro: is there any easy retreat?
[04:09] <strabes> Moosejaw: glad to hear it
[04:09] <bimberi> g0tw00d: how about pastebin.ca
[04:09] <bimberi> ?
[04:09] <g0tw00d> let me check
[04:09] <kitche> strabes: well in reality its the only fork of compiz to have existed so far :)
[04:09] <jspiro> mash, a reinstall takes 15 to 60 min. Or ask for help diagnosing the problem.
[04:09] <Moosejaw> thanks guys
[04:10] <jspiro> Wonderl00t, which package?
[04:10] <Moosejaw> where is the best tutorial for beryl and my card?
[04:10] <the_burk> taan: i use vlc and no v4l
[04:10] <strabes> kitche: yeah i know, i meant it's a fork of compiz and it's better
[04:10] <Wonderl00t> jspiro: audacity
[04:10] <lucas9000> i guess i'll try to get flash working in firefox...thanks guys
[04:10] <jspiro> Wonderl00t, dpkg -L audacity
[04:10] <strabes> Moosejaw: wiki.beryl-project.org
[04:10] <jspiro> Wonderl00t, but why do you want to know?
[04:10] <Wonderl00t> jspiro: thanks
[04:10] <mash> jspiro: help diagnosing?  thanks.  what would be useful info to share?
[04:10] <strabes> Moosejaw: also, the only driver that supports the x1400 is FGLRX
[04:10] <once375ml> join #ubuntu-cn
[04:10] <Moosejaw> strabes thanks for all your help
[04:10] <jevangelo> are there any mirrors for the us repositories
[04:10] <g0tw00d> bimberi: pastebin.ca/266432
[04:10] <jspiro> mash, dunno. tell the channel all your symptoms
[04:10] <jevangelo> or is there just that one
[04:10] <Moosejaw> hrm...
[04:10] <strabes> Moosejaw: np that's what i'm here for
[04:10] <Moosejaw> ok
[04:11] <Wonderl00t> im a musician experimenting with linux audio and using rosegarden. i need to set audacity as the "audio" editor
[04:11] <misterph3r> bimberi: Thanks.
[04:11] <Moosejaw> what does the driver thing mean?
[04:11] <kitche> jevangelo: all the mirrors are the same actually
[04:11] <Moosejaw> dont change drivers?
[04:11] <Wonderl00t> jspiro: im a musician experimenting with linux audio and using rosegarden. i need to set audacity as the "audio" editor
[04:11] <KeeganX> So is ca.archive.ubuntu.com just the same as the us.archive.ubuntu.com?
[04:11] <x-r00t-x> is GStreamer codecs are good ???
[04:11] <Rug> jevangelo: just change it to archive.  (remove the us. )
[04:11] <kitche> jevangelo: so use ca.archieve.ubuntu.com or the main one
[04:11] <strabes> x-r00t-x: yes they're good
[04:11] <jevangelo> its ok
[04:11] <jspiro> Wonderl00t, dunno. try asking the whole channel again, or try http://www.ubuntuforums.org
[04:12] <jspiro> all, what is the usual procedure for creating PDF files from Ubuntu apps?
[04:12] <ArrenLex> KeeganX: It's a different mirror for the same content.
[04:12] <Rug> jspiro: what apps?
[04:12] <mash> Any tips for this:  I have occasional, random freezes in edgy eft.   mouse and keyboard go dead, can't use alt-ctrl-backspace to  restart xwindows, can't use alt-ctrl-delete to reboot, with some of the crashes, can't ssh in from another box on the home network ("Host down").
[04:12] <ethos> Can anybody tell me how I would go about applying this patch? http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/S3switch#Bugs.2FCaveats
[04:12] <strabes> jspiro: openoffice writer has that capability built in
[04:12] <jspiro> Rug, Dia for example
[04:12] <KeeganX> Right on, as long as it's the same stuff I'm fine with it
[04:12] <noelferreira> hi people
[04:12] <Moosejaw> strabes: so i should keep the current driver i am using?
[04:12] <x-r00t-x> thank you strabes but what about the sound quality ?
[04:12] <Wonderl00t> thanks jspiro
[04:12] <bimberi> g0tw00d: looks ok.  have you done a 'sudo apt-get update' recently?
[04:12] <mash> Can't identify a precipitating condition or  incident.  Just crash.
[04:12] <g0tw00d> nope
[04:13] <noelferreira> hi want to mount an ext3 partition with permissons for all users. how i do that?
[04:13] <malt> anyone here use a D LINK router? I run a ubuntu server, and my router finally died so i got a d link, and when i go to status the release and renew is blanked out why?
[04:13] <strabes> Moosejaw: if that driver is fglrx, yes. if not then you should install fglrx, it's really easy to do. see this link for how to do it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[04:13] <jspiro> mash, dunno. try asking again in 2 min, or try www.ubuntuforums.org
[04:13] <cwmajors> jspiro : I think cups-pdf is the package you want to install.
[04:13] <Rug> jspiro: 2 methods:  select the "create pdf" in the print menu.  or print to PostScript and then convert it.
[04:13] <strabes> x-r00t-x: good as far as I can tell
[04:13] <jspiro> cwmajors, ok thanks
[04:13] <Moosejaw> i have the fglrx installed already
[04:13] <fiendskull9> HELLO
[04:14] <Rug> fiendskull9: stop yelling
[04:14] <g0tw00d> bimberi:i get a bunch of errors want an output?
[04:14] <adam> please...nobody seems to want to help me...ever since compiz updated yesterday 3d performance has been slow and direct rendering is being reported not on...Nvidia drivers and XGL/Compiz are correctly installed...but the glxinfo reports my vendor string is now SGI...what's wrong??
[04:14] <fiendskull9> my ubuntu-server install is having problems
[04:14] <jspiro> fiendskull9, hello, please don't use all caps
[04:14] <strabes> x-r00t-x: i don't have a hi-def sound card anyway so it doesn't matter
[04:14] <ArrenLex> Moosejaw: fglrx is notoriously buggy. It may be causing your freezes.

[04:14] <fiendskull9> but i my server wont resolve any hosts
[04:14] <mash> I am fully up to date, etc.  I have looked at /var/log/messages, etc.  The only cluse is "ProcXCloseDevice to close or not ?" may appear in Xorg.0.log shortly before the crashes.  What does that line mean?
[04:14] <kitche> adam: if it says sGI then your not using the nvidia drivers
[04:15] <ArrenLex> Moosejaw: wait, mixed up to conversations, ignore me :)
[04:15] <tim167> what's the unix command for "copy every file in a folder+subfolders if it has a certain extention" ?
[04:15] <ArrenLex> Sorry.
[04:15] <adam> well then what's the correct tutorial to RE-install nvidia drivers under edgy...there seems to be too many conflicting tutorials
[04:15] <cwmajors> OK, I am having trouble getting Ubuntu to run on my main system (it

[04:15] <adam> kitche I've tried that it does nothing

[04:16] <ArrenLex> noelferreria: how are you trying to mount it right now?
[04:16] <strabes> Moosejaw: you have to use XGL
[04:16] <Moosejaw> ok
[04:16] <Moosejaw> thanks guys

[04:17] <ethos> Do I need to compile something?
[04:18] <moiqou> what is the command for seeing what dependencies a program haves for it to be able to execute? I have forgot...
[04:18] <bimberi> g0tw00d: yuk, i've seen those "Sub-process bzip2 returned an error code (2)" messages a few times.  Sometimes running it again fixes it
[04:18] <adam> kitche I just tried it again I ran that command with the enable option and restarted x and still it's reporting SGI
[04:19] <adam> it was all working before the compiz update yesterday

[04:24] <Moodles> I'm using EXT3 on all my harddrives. What commands should I be using to do a scan of the filesystem (fsck I think) and to scan the entire harddrive itself (i dont know what to use) ?
[04:24] <noelferreira> i thought i was disconected
[04:24] <taan> driver config, is default, just did a dpkg reconfigure
[04:24] <degantyll> Moodles, first of all, the root filesystem must be checked offline, and all the others must be checked umounted
[04:24] <jspiro> Moodles, use fsck -a when unmounted
[04:24] <jspiro> for more info http://wikipedia.org/wiki/fsck
[04:25] <degantyll> taan, try Option "RenderAccel" "true" on Xorg.conf
[04:25] <degantyll> this one: Option      "RenderAccel" "true"

[04:25] <taan> degantyll, i noticed that vlc performance is slow and image quality is not as good, does that give a hint ?
[04:25] <noelferreira> of course i tried it before jspiro
[04:26] <jspiro> noelferreira, try the forums.
[04:26] <jspiro> search them i guess.
[04:26] <cwmajors> Could someone help me troubleshoot why the live CD fails to boot up Ubuntu on one of my computers?

[04:29] <kitche> jspiro: why it will take hours to get to everyone
[04:29] <degantyll> Moodles, run fsck with the -c options
[04:29] <TSWoodV> jspiro, that would have been nice.
[04:29] <DPackrat> Is there a reason why multimedia keys work in Totem but not in xmms?
[04:29] <jspiro> kitche, but that's better than nothing :)
[04:30] <degantyll> taan, try commenting it
[04:30] <degantyll> Moodles, run badblock from fsck.ext3 with the parameter -c. Running badblocks standalone is not recommended if you don't know what you are doing
[04:30] <degantyll> (says in the manual)
[04:31] <degantyll> man fsck.ext3 and man badblocks

[04:33] <minerale> how do I run .desktop files  from the command line ?
[04:33] <kitche> Vodan: you have to configure X
[04:33] <nu> Anyone have time to help me with php/apache?
[04:33] <Vodan> sorry, i'm a windows whore, how would I go about this?
[04:33] <SuperQ> Vodan: what video card do you have?
[04:33] <Vodan> 7800gt
[04:34] <SuperQ> Vodan: nvidia?
[04:34] <mash> OK, I am looking for other people who have had random freezes, crashes, of X using ubuntu.  For example, I think that this comment https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/30447/comments/97 is in the wrong place.  It's actually the problem I'm having.
[04:34] <Vodan> yeah
[04:34] <kitche> Vodan: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg then input your user password and hit enter
[04:34] <Yggdrasil> anyone know how to get this hald restarted ? something messed heree.
[04:34] <SuperQ> kitche: no
[04:34] <mash> Is there any point in reinstalling X?  Again, my problem is random crashes after some period of use.
[04:34] <SuperQ> kitche: he probably needs nvidia-glx
[04:34] <Moodles> degantyll: to take the root filesystem offline, I'm guessing I can't use recovery mode from grub boot.. i need to boot from a linux cd with the tools?
[04:34] <SuperQ> Vodan: one sec, let me get you a howto
[04:34] <kitche> SuperQ: umm why it will work with nv driver
[04:34] <Vodan> SuperQ: k, thanks
[04:35] <degantyll> Moodles, you are right
[04:35] <nostradaemons> yo guys, my ubuntu crashes after I ctrl+alt+backspace my X server, any ideas?
[04:35] <SuperQ> kitche: because nv sucks ;)
[04:35] <GenNMX> mash: Sure, if you want more random crashes, hehe. Anyway, I'd look at hardware. Get the Ultimate Boot CD and run some hardware tests -- memory and hardrive at least.
[04:35] <jspiro> nostradaemons, don't press c+a+bksp :)
[04:36] <nostradaemons> jspiro, tho the same, but it just caucht my attention :)
[04:36] <Vodan> SuperQ: thanks
[04:36] <Yggdrasil> nostradaemons  is it an intel ?
[04:36] <mash> GenNMX: thanks for the advice.  what should i be looking for?  again, this problem developed after i went from dapper to edgy.  i had a totally stable dapper.
[04:36] <nostradaemons> s/caucht/caught
[04:36] <nostradaemons> yep
[04:36] <jspiro> nostradaemons, if you find the cause, feel free to file a bug report. :)
[04:36] <nostradaemons> toshiba notebook, intel video
[04:36] <GenNMX> mash: Did it happen immediatly after Edgy?
[04:36] <b0ss_> if i type something in nano how would i save like i wanted to edit the source.list how would i save it
[04:37] <b0ss_> need to as repos
[04:37] <mash> yes, it started within a day or two of the edgy install.
[04:37] <lucas9000> ok i'm trying to get flash to work with firefox 2 on edgy 6.10 amd64
[04:37] <Yggdrasil> nostradaemons i have the same problem with my laptop and its actualy a driver issue
[04:37] <lucas9000> i get this error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35241/
[04:37] <nostradaemons> toshiba?
[04:37] <GenNMX> mash: Then I would say it has something to do with Edgy. Do you have a seperate home partition? Might be faster just to install Edgy from scratch.
[04:37] <kitche> SuperQ: I just looked at the image nad it does seem like a driver issue but nv should have worked fine
[04:37] <Yggdrasil> i bet you can replicate it by doing ctrl-alt -f1
[04:37] <nostradaemons> Yggdrasil, toshiba  notebook?
[04:38] <taan> is there option to make glxgears to print FPS?
[04:38] <kitche> lucas9000: well flash doesn't work on x86_64 system
[04:38] <mash> GenNMX: I can backup to external HD, then reinstall.  you think not much hope for a fix on the current system?  I have been trhough lots of logs.
[04:38] <SuperQ> taan: it used to, I don't know why it doesn't anymore
[04:38] <timm_> what is your name
[04:38] <kitche> taan: you need to use a switch to do it
[04:38] <cwmajors> mash - I have seen the same thing as you're reporting- random crashes after upgrading from dapper->edgy. They seem to have stopped after a couple of days, though- I've been stable for a week now. YMMV.
[04:38] <nostradaemons> Yggdrasil, ctrl-alt-f1 wont crash my x
[04:38] <lucas9000> kitche: i was following these instructions: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290785&highlight=flash+edgy+64
[04:38] <blameless> taan: glxgears -printfps
[04:38] <Yggdrasil> no
[04:39] <Yggdrasil> nostradaemons do it a few times and the back into f8
[04:39] <SuperQ> blameless: oh.. thanks!
[04:39] <Vodan> ctrl+alt+f1 doesn't even do anything super
[04:39] <Yggdrasil> because i can make mine crash safter switchen around fora bit.
[04:39] <taan> blameless, that works !!! wonder why it does not say it in the inline help
[04:39] <SuperQ> Vodan: oh.. weird
[04:39] <mash> cwmajors:  please tell me more.  are there any sites that discuss the problem?
[04:39] <blameless> SuperQ: i think it doesn't do it anymore as they don't want it used as a benchmark
[04:39] <SuperQ> Vodan: you will have to boot to recovery mode then
[04:39] <Yggdrasil> well its switching it beetween x and console mode , i htink thats where the problem is
[04:39] <SuperQ> blameless: yea
[04:39] <nostradaemons> no no
[04:39] <Vodan> which is in grub right?
[04:39] <Yggdrasil> nonono
[04:39] <mash> the randomness makes it really hard to track down.
[04:39] <Yggdrasil> ok then i dont know
[04:39] <SuperQ> Vodan: correct
[04:40] <Vodan> k brb
[04:40] <SuperQ> Vodan: oh..
[04:40] <cwmajors> Not that I found. I couldn't find a way to report it other than " hay my computer crashes sometimes when I do stuff", so I didn't report it. :)
[04:40] <SuperQ> Vodan: you can just type exit after running those two commands
[04:40] <taan> so glxgears give me 108.391 FPS for fullscreen (1680x1050), is that good/bad/ok performance-wise?
[04:41] <lucas9000> kitche: are you saying there's no way to get flash working on a 64-bit os?
[04:41] <kitche> taan: well considering that glxgears usn't a benchmark
[04:41] <blameless> taan: resolution shouldn't matter too much.  glxgears should be in a static window
[04:41] <mash> the crashes got pretty frequent this afternoon, T+1 week after the edgy install.  I switched to KDE and have had zero crashes in the past four hours.
[04:41] <kitche> lucas9000: well you have to have a multilib system
[04:41] <SuperQ> lucas9000: there are ways
[04:41] <stelt> anybody here experience with multiple monitors?
[04:41] <mash> I don't mind staying with kde (i slightly prefer gnome)
[04:41] <SuperQ> lucas9000: but mostly a pain in the ass to setup
[04:41] <SuperQ> lucas9000: #1: install 32bit firefox
[04:41] <blameless> taan: that said, that would seem to be a bit slow
[04:41] <lucas9000> superq: yeah i'm finding that out
[04:41] <mash> yes, i can help with multiple monitors if you are using nvidia.
[04:41] <taan> blameless what do you mean static window?
[04:42] <SuperQ> lucas9000: #2: install the 64-32bit firefox wrapper module
[04:42] <mash> stelt?
[04:42] <taan> blameless i can move and resize
[04:42] <blameless> taan: oh yeah
[04:42] <josue_> holA
[04:42] <nostradaemons> just for the record, any bonnie expert in the house?
[04:42] <blameless> taan: but if you change the size, we really wouldn't have a clue
[04:42] <blameless> taan: for real benchmarking, i'd use ioquake3 assuming you own the game
[04:42] <stelt> mash, a matrox dualhead card on AGP, plus some ancient PCI card
[04:42] <lucas9000> superq: like this? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1174435
[04:42] <blameless> taan: what card is this?
[04:42] <mash> stelt,  i may still be able to help
[04:43] <mash> try the instructions at the following website.  i will get back in one minute after i check my email.
[04:43] <taan> well, that's why i specified the size: full screen 1680x1050. card nvidia 5200 FX
[04:43] <SuperQ> lucas9000: yea.. the firefox32 deb would work
[04:43] <SuperQ> lucas9000: if you want 64bit firefox: http://gwenole.beauchesne.info/projects/nspluginwrapper/
[04:43] <blameless> taan: those cards tend to be a bit underpowered but if you're not planning on playing doom3 you're fine :)

[04:44] <blameless> yes, i have one of those in the computer i'm junking for christmas :)
[04:44] <lucas9000> superq: isn't that what this is supposed to do? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290785&highlight=flash+edgy+64
[04:44] <lucas9000> (meaning using nspluginwrapper)
[04:45] <SuperQ> lucas9000: yea
[04:45] <mash> stelt: these directions are from the nvidia website, but they are generic multiple monitor directions http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9742/README/appendix-p.html
[04:45] <degantyll> heh
[04:45] <degantyll> damn ISPs
[04:45] <lucas9000> superq: maybe i'll just try the 32 bit firefox because i followed the instructions in that nspluginwrapper thread and it's not working
[04:45] <degantyll> so taan did it work?
[04:45] <mash> note: these are NOT TwinView (nVidia-specific) instructions.  these are generic multiple monitor instructions.
[04:45] <Vodan> it tells me to put in my disk and press enter, but my disk is already in
[04:45] <Moodles> I run fsck -a on a filesystem, yet it finishs straight away (250-320gb harddrives).. is it normal: "/dev/sdb1: clean, 2309/30539776 files, 56735192/61049000 blocks"
[04:46] <lucas9000> how can i go back and basically "undo" the stuff that didn't turn out to work?
[04:46] <SuperQ> lucas9000: yea.. I've never gotten nspluginwrapper to work either ;)
[04:46] <SuperQ> lucas9000: but I havn't tried it in a year
[04:46] <lucas9000> or is that even necessary?
[04:46] <Vodan> super
[04:46] <degantyll> Moodles, they are marked as clean, so the program skips them, try using -f to force it to check the filesystem even if marked clean
[04:46] <SuperQ> lucas9000: just keep track of which packages you installed
[04:46] <SuperQ> Vodan: yo
[04:46] <taan> blameless, yeah, i know what u mean, though i'd like to  have this setup working for some time. (hey if you dont need the card, i could use another 5200 pci one)
[04:46] <SuperQ> lucas9000: and apt-get --purge remove
[04:46] <Vodan> it tells me to put in my cd, but its already in
[04:46] <Moodles> degantyll: ah thanks
[04:46] <SuperQ> Vodan: oh
[04:47] <degantyll> Moodles, welcome :)
[04:47] <SuperQ> Vodan: yea.. slightly anoying
[04:47] <SuperQ> Vodan: you can remove the CD
[04:47] <lucas9000> superq: so, for example, apt-get --purge remove nspluginwrapper ?
[04:47] <SuperQ> Vodan: the problem is it's not auto-mounting in recovery mode
[04:47] <blameless> taan: i believe its going to my future sister-in-law as she needs a machine heh
[04:47] <SuperQ> lucas9000: yea
[04:47] <Vodan> how do i mount it?
[04:47] <taan> degantyll, seems an improvement, menu seems a bit snappier. though benchmack still shows the same
[04:47] <SuperQ> Vodan: mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
[04:48] <lucas9000> ok thanks superq and kitche...back to the battle
[04:48] <Vodan> thanks
[04:48] <SuperQ> Vodan: the other option is to remove the CD from the sources.list
[04:48] <Lovloss> Why is it that blender renders animations faster in xp than it does in Ubuntu? It takes forever :( And it says its allocating less memory towards the animation
[04:48] <SuperQ> Vodan: and pull all updates from the internet
[04:48] <taan> but hey, anybody want to run the benchmark (source is available, too, 1 page gtkmm)?
[04:48] <invitado> hello everyone
[04:49] <Vodan> i'd probably need to config my tcp/ip settings and stuff, so i'll takethe first route
[04:49] <SuperQ> Vodan: you can "nano /etc/apt/sources.list" and put a # infront of the "deb cdrom://..." line
[04:49] <Vodan> brb
[04:49] <degantyll> taan, oh, try googling it
[04:49] <SuperQ> Vodan: it should do that by default
[04:49] <invitado> rigth
[04:49] <taan> degantyll, sorry, googling what?
[04:49] <invitado> hello !!!!
[04:50] <SuperQ> invitado: HI!
[04:50] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: I don't use blender so I am just generally troubleshooting but, Does Blender use the video card when rendering, and/or Do you have a Dual Core Processor?
[04:50] <aciid_trojan> how do i install a C compiler on ubuntu server
[04:50] <degantyll> taan, the perfomance issue
[04:50] <stelt> mash, bookmarked it. I'll shall Google on "create device", probably meaning editing some conf file (i'm a Windows user)
[04:50] <bimberi> aciid_trojan: install build-essential
[04:50] <degantyll> taan, you should also try a game, see how it runs
[04:50] <RancidLM> hey all a little off topic but i would like to use my monitor with my video game console and would like to have streaming video to a window... is a) there any delay time b) possible with a hauppauge capture card?
[04:50] <Lovloss> Jordan_U not entirely sure, but it shouldnt matter. It rendered faster on my computer at work, and its a 20 gig, 250RAM computer with only a basic video card
[04:51] <taan> deantyll, is it free ?
[04:51] <bthornton> When I connect my external USB hard drive to my Ubuntu machine, it automagically mounts it (which is what I want)--but it mounts it read-only.  Where can I modify the default permissions for mounted USB devices?
[04:51] <degantyll> taan, google is a search website. About the games, a free one would be gl-117
[04:51] <x-r00t-x> strabes,  wow i installed those codecs
[04:51] <x-r00t-x> and great sound :D
[04:51] <x-r00t-x> sup SuperQ  :D
[04:52] <aciid_trojan> bimberi: thank you
[04:52] <blameless> taan: tenebrous is also free and uses the quake 3 engine
[04:52] <SuperQ> x-r00t-x: surfing the web, digesting dinner
[04:52] <Vodan> super, it installs the nvidia-glx, but when i tryp to enable the config, it says its not there, but if i do the apt-get for the glx again, it says its up to date
[04:52] <SuperQ> Vodan: hrm
[04:52] <strabes> x-r00t-x: sweet i'm glad
[04:52] <Lovloss> perhaps i installed beryl incorrectly and its hurting my speed?
[04:52] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Whell it could if you use an ATI card ( horrible drivers ) or are using an Nvidia card without nvidea-glx, that is if Blender ises the video card when rendering.
[04:52] <Lovloss> im in nvidia, and i have invidia-glx
[04:53] <craigbass1976> Is there a documet somewhere that explains how ubuntu handles the sudo, both in a command line and in the gui.  Coming from another linux, I'm kind of confused.  I'm not sure what's happening when I give another user priveledges in the GUI (modem, administrative, etc...)
[04:53] <kitche> Vodan: you did sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[04:53] <SuperQ> Vodan: the config thing just updates the X config
[04:53] <x-r00t-x> SuperQ, have fun dude :D
[04:53] <Vodan> super: so should I try just booting up again?
[04:53] <x-r00t-x> strabes,  :D
[04:53] <SuperQ> Vodan: erm.. one sec
[04:53] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Having beryl period will reduce your speed
[04:53] <kitche> !root|craigbass1976
[04:53] <ubotu> craigbass1976: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:54] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Especially if you use XGL, but even with AIGLX
[04:54] <x-r00t-x> strabes,  i installed automatix . its sucks.
[04:54] <romance> 
[04:54] <taan> ok, thanks guys, especially blameless and degantyll, we'll have to continue this some other time
[04:54] <Lovloss> just having it?
[04:54] <romance> hi
[04:54] <Lovloss> even if its off?
[04:54] <x-r00t-x> i wont install those sucks 3rd paty software :)
[04:54] <strabes> x-r00t-x: why does it suck? I've had no problems with it, but we're not supposed to offer support in this channel for it
[04:54] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: No, not when it is off.
[04:55] <romance> hi
[04:55] <Lovloss> Well then. there you have it :<
[04:55] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Unless you use XGL in which case XGL can be running even when Beryl is not.
[04:55] <Cas> !ko > romance
[04:56] <romance> 
[04:56] <degantyll> taan, allright
[04:56] <Lovloss> Oh.! How do i find out :3
[04:56] <Vodan> let me check
[04:56] <SuperQ> ok
[04:56] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: glxinfo | grep direct
[04:57] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: If it says Direct rendering = no, you are still using XGL
[04:57] <nu> i cannot run php files on my computer if my life depended on it
[04:57] <Lovloss> nope im not :P
[04:57] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Also: ps aux | grep xgl
[04:57] <SuperQ> nu: that sounds like a good thing ;)
[04:58] <nu> SuperQ: =(
[04:58] <x-r00t-x> strabes,  my internet is really slow .4Kb/s and to download codecs take my whole night and its didnt works
[04:58] <x-r00t-x> @time dhaka
[04:58] <x-r00t-x> whatever i gotta go sleep

[04:59] <con-man> i dont know the repository
[04:59] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Then you are not running XGL
[04:59] <Cas> Jordan_U, Lovloss: It's: glxinfo | grep -i direct
[04:59] <bimberi> !xinerama | con-man
[04:59] <ubotu> con-man: xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[04:59] <Cas> or: grep Direct

[05:03] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: I don't know then, is it only Blender that is slow?
[05:03] <Vodan> i did conf

[05:03] <Lovloss> seems to be
[05:03] <Vodan> does nothing
[05:03] <lucas9000> i downloaded a tar.gz file and i need to run the script (which is the unpacked file i guess)...how do i do that?
[05:03] <Lovloss> qhhh i think cause im using an external
[05:04] <Vodan> so much for "it just works" :(
[05:04] <conreyt> anyone know how to fix this? java+azureus issue: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35243/
[05:04] <bruenig> lucas9000, you need to extract the tar.gz file
[05:04] <bruenig> lucas9000, tar zxvf whatever.tar.gz
[05:05] <sc4ttrdbr4in> lucas9000: :there should be README file inside it
[05:05] <kitche> Vodan: does it look like a console or has it shwon the $ yet?
[05:05] <Vodan> when i try to boot normally?
[05:05] <Vodan> http://img296.imageshack.us/img296/2395/imgp1478vt2.jpg
[05:05] <kitche> Vodan: after you ran the grep command but it should eb cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf|grep nvidia
[05:05] <SuperQ> kitche: I had him do that
[05:06] <lucas9000> bruenig: ok i did that
[05:06] <SuperQ> kitche: it's not in there
[05:06] <Vodan> its just like blank
[05:06] <Vodan> a blank line
[05:06] <bruenig> lucas9000, ok, change into the directory, cd directory
[05:06] <SuperQ> Vodan: it's not blank, the command I gave you was a search for text
[05:06] <ArrenLex> I have lots of folders with .zip files in them. I want to take all these zip files and put them into one folder. Is there any magical way to do so?
[05:06] <kitche> SuperQ: well he said he just did grep -c3 nvidia|/etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:06] <SuperQ> oh
[05:06] <SuperQ> -C
[05:06] <SuperQ> like I said.. case matters
[05:06] <stazich> hi, i am trying to change permissions of a file to have full access to it, what should i do? right now only apache has access i have been told
[05:06] <bruenig> lucas9000, from there to "ls" to list the contents and there should be a README or something else to tip you off
[05:07] <bruenig> s/to/do
[05:07] <Vodan> k brb
[05:07] <lucas9000> bruenig: ok i see
[05:07] <lucas9000> readme has instructions
[05:07] <cwmajors> Still need some help getting my 6.10 live CD to boot up. I'm using the F6 mode to remove quiet and splash and adding acpi=off (from a tip on the forum), and it looks like everything is great up until the time it should be showing me Gnome- then the screen blanks and I get nothing. I even chose "use safe graphics mode". What to do?
[05:07] <lucas9000> bruenig: thanks...i'm still very new to this
[05:07] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Yup, easy actually, cp /wherever/*.zip /wherever you want them to go  :)
[05:07] <moiqou> goodbye... good night...
[05:07] <bruenig> !thanks | lucas9000
[05:07] <ubotu> lucas9000: You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[05:07] <kitche> SuperQ: but if he doesn't cat xorg.conf it won't even look for nvidia at least from my knowledge
[05:07] <fbc> Is there anyway to view ASP pages with ubuntu????
[05:08] <SuperQ> kitche: you don't need cat
[05:08] <fbc> or firefox?
[05:08] <SuperQ> kitche: grep [options]  PATTERN [FILE...] 
[05:08] <bruenig> fbc, what is an ASP page?
[05:08] <sc4ttrdbr4in> fbc: yes
[05:08] <Vodan> its still a uh
[05:08] <Vodan> blank
[05:08] <SuperQ> Vodan: ok
[05:08] <Rookie_> Active Server Page
[05:08] <SuperQ> Vodan: one more option to grep
[05:08] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Well, yes, that's obvious. The problem is, I have over a hundred of these folders.
[05:08] <sc4ttrdbr4in> fbc: mod_mono through apache ;)
[05:09] <SuperQ> Vodan: grep -i -C3 "nvidia" /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:09] <Vodan> k brb
[05:09] <fbc> bruenig:  Well my bank page for one. I've changed my user agnet to IE6 in firefox, and my banks page stil won't load, so I guess I need a browser that can support ASP. Right?
[05:09] <cwmajors> Nobody can help with my livecd problem? Any suggestion where to go?
[05:09] <kitche> SuperQ: ah yeah that brings back the whole section my way only brings back one or two lines that's why I think i like cat better
[05:09] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Got it, sorry I misunderstood, you can still do it though with some bash scripting
[05:09] <stelt> fbc, asp is server side
[05:09] <Rookie_> ASP is microsofts answer on php
=== ActiveOne is now known as IdleOne
[05:09] <SuperQ> kitche: I wanted the whole section
[05:10] <kitche> SuperQ: at least I know you can do it that way now :)
[05:10] <SuperQ> kitche: -C is for "context"
[05:10] <fbc> stelt:  ahh..
[05:10] <SuperQ> kitche: grep is your friend :)
[05:10] <sc4ttrdbr4in> cwmajors: check the cd itself? maybe its broken (just like my case)
[05:10] <fbc> Rookie_:  thanks.. for the explaination.
[05:10] <drcode> hi all
[05:10] <kitche> SuperQ: I use grep all the time but I usually do that cat way since I know what I m looking for usually
[05:10] <drcode> I have qustion about pppconfig
[05:10] <SuperQ> kitche: yea
[05:10] <fbc> stelt:  So what can I try to run my banks page?
[05:10] <Rookie_> with that i wanted to say - it dosent matter what browser ....
[05:10] <drcode> I saw that there is option to dial from pon command?
[05:11] <drcode> I can also use mgetty?
[05:11] <drcode> what is better?
[05:11] <sc4ttrdbr4in> fbc: :firefox should load just fien imo
[05:11] <Vodan> still nothing
[05:11] <SuperQ> kitche: I just wish ubuntu would default to nvidia binary drivers
[05:11] <SuperQ> Vodan: well.. you're going to have to edit the file by hand then
[05:11] <SuperQ> Vodan: nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:11] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: I got it, no worries.
[05:11] <Vodan> wasn't ubuntu supposed to "just work"
[05:12] <fbc> sc4ttrdbr4in:  It won't it tells me I NEED IE6 OR netscape 7.1, and I've switched between both user agents , and no cigar..
[05:12] <SuperQ> Vodan: yea, it is.. except for the bugs :)
[05:12] <Pelo> SuperQ,  you forgot sudo first
[05:12] <SuperQ> Pelo: he's booted in recovery mode
[05:12] <kitche> Vodan: it does just work :) but sometiems there are bugs
[05:12] <Pelo> ah
[05:12] <Vodan> can you type everything now, so i can just do it at once
[05:12] <SuperQ> Vodan: one sec
[05:12] <Vodan> so i don't have to run between rooms
[05:13] <SuperQ> heh
[05:13] <Jordan_U> fbc: You can run IE6 in Linux with IE4linux
[05:13] <SuperQ> yes.. one sec
[05:13] <SuperQ> let me type it up
[05:13] <fbc> Jordan_U:  thanks I'll try that..

[05:14] <noodles12> is there a linux alternative to Maple that uses similar syntax?

[05:14] <kitche> juyi?

[05:15] <mogorman> i installed ubuntu 6.10 on my mac mini ppc it seems to only boot into single user mode, i always have to manually push it to init 2
[05:15] <mogorman> any ideas as to why
[05:15] <mogorman> inittab is correct
[05:15] <noodles12> jrib: the thing is i have a hw assignment due 2morrow and maple is only on school computers. I need to run my code to amke sure the syntax goes through and if it works
[05:15] <Vodan> ok
[05:15] <Vodan> let me go try
[05:15] <Vodan> first, yea i know

[05:17] <jrib> noodles12: hmm, I doubt there is anything that uses the same exact syntax.  Maybe you can ssh to a school computer and run it from the command line?  I don't mind running the file once on here if you put it up on pastebin
[05:17] <degantyll> tIgErStYLe, creo que te equivocaste de lugar para tratar de ligar
[05:17] <degantyll> tIgErStYLe, hay muchisismos mas canales en esta red donde puedes buscar gente, aqui es el canal de soporte de una distribucin de Linux
[05:18] <jrib> degantyll: thank you
[05:18] <degantyll> jrib, welcome
[05:20] <noodles12> jrib: i appreciate it. if i finsih the code sometime soon i'll surely take you up on your offer =). and i also don't know how to ssh to my schools computer and am unsure if they support it.
[05:20] <jrib> noodles12: university or high school?
[05:20] <mogorman> nevermind it was bug in yaboot.conf
[05:20] <noodles12> university
[05:21] <jrib> noodles12: your math department probably has something setup, just approach your professor about it

[05:23] <madman91> hey guys
[05:23] <turd125> i dont think anyone in here can talk
[05:24] <turd125> i was wondering if someone could tell me where connect to server mounts the server
[05:24] <madman91> i have a VERY broad question... how do i make an ubuntu server on a computer.. including details like finding a domain name.. (preferably free) ... etc.. I am a complete server noob.. but i am ok in linux... can someone point me onto a trail?
[05:24] <Pelo> turd125,  it is possible that no one currently in can help
[05:24] <Dasnipa`> anyone by chance know of a console command to sync the system clock to the timeserver? my comp is getting older and starts to run slow within a week these days
[05:24] <turd125> no idea
[05:24] <turd125> no idea
[05:24] <turd125> i was wondering if someone could tell me where connect to server mounts the server
[05:24] <Dasnipa`> i just wanna make a cronjob for it or something
[05:24] <kitche> Dasnipa`: you need to install ntp then run ntpdate
[05:24] <crimsun> Dasnipa`: that happens automatically whenever a network interface is brought up (on ifup)
[05:24] <kitche> !repeat|turd125

[05:25] <kitche> paul_it: ask in ##slackware since some people in there use it
[05:25] <crimsun> Dasnipa`: if you're noticing clock desync, you could either install ntp-server or crontab an ntpdate
[05:25] <turd125> well its seems to be an easy question that any experience usr should know
[05:25] <paul_it> thanx!!!!
[05:25] <Dasnipa`> kitche, i apparently have ntp, and running ntp gets me this: 3 Dec 22:25:19 ntpdate[30155] : no servers can be used, exiting
[05:26] <kitche> Dasnipa`: you might have to edit the ntp config file
[05:26] <kitche> turd125: it mounts where the other files mounts either /media or /mnt
[05:26] <Dasnipa`> ok ty

[05:33] <||bass> joshj, those are both command line apps afaik
[05:34] <JoshJ> sorry dude :\
[05:34] <||bass> oh well
[05:34] <||bass> i was hoping i wasn't going to have to edit like 50 mime types in the terminal
[05:34] <||bass> was worth asking
[05:34] <JoshJ> heh :(
[05:34] <Buck_> Hello.How do I use a Netgear WGT624 v3 wireless router with Ubuntu?
[05:34] <JoshJ> !wifi | buck
[05:34] <ubotu> buck: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:35] <turd125> !wt
[05:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wt - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:35] <turd125> !wine
[05:35] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.

[05:35] <ubotu> Buck_: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:35] <Buck_> Thank you.
[05:36] <strabes> Buck_: i would recommend network-manager-gnome
[05:36] <Buck_> Where do I get that?
[05:36] <||bass> anyone know where to file a suggestion?
[05:36] <turd125> i was wondering if someone could tell me "where connect to server" mounts the server
[05:37] <Buck_> Do I need ndiswrapper?
[05:37] <JoshJ> you get it by doing sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
[05:37] <JoshJ> as for ndiswrapper it depends on your card specifically and the instructions on the wiki
[05:37] <JoshJ> !netgear
[05:37] <abarbaccia> hello all, I have an asus p5b-e motherboard and for some reason a lot of my network connections are dropping. When i go to upload files to ftp, http, etc. The transfers stall. any ideas?

[05:39] <||bass> ok, is there any place i can file some kind of official suggestion?
[05:41] <jrib> ||bass: file a bug I suppose
[05:42] <||bass> it's not really a bug though
[05:42] <||bass> that seems a bit inappropriate
[05:42] <jrib> ||bass: bugs can be "wishlist"
[05:43] <||bass> oh, thathelps
[05:44] <Buck_> The internet's not on Ubuntu right now because I'm using the wireless router I'm talking about here so I'm doing this from Windows.Can I download the deb manually?

[05:47] <Buck_> I also posted this on the Ubuntu Forums with nickname Coop.Can you please see it over there and reply there?

[05:48] <||bass> oh this is classic, i log into the ubuntu bug tracker
[05:48] <Buck_> Thank you.
[05:48] <||bass> the first bug on the list, "microsoft has a majority market share"
[05:48] <SilentDis> hi hi :)
[05:48] <||bass> status: critical

[05:49] <jrib> ||bass: yes, please help us squash that bug :)
[05:49] <SilentDis> lol bass
[05:49] <ab0oo> hate to ask twice, but how do I compile/package a package that I retrieved with "apt-get source <package> "?  I have the directory created by apt-get, but I want to compile it using the same ./configure params the original packager used.
[05:49] <Lovloss> How come when i try to install cinepaint it tells me "something" conflicts with it

[05:50] <joga> hello, what is the kernel version shipped with ubuntu 6.10?
[05:50] <joga> hard to find the info on the ubuntu webpage..
[05:50] <SbCl3> i'm having a problem... something seems to be broken in dapper that isn't broken in earlier versions.... in earlier versions i could create an iso with the command "sudo cat /dev/cdrom > image.iso". However, that doesn't work anymore, it says 'no medium found'. The CD drive makes noises, so it is the right drive
[05:50] <degantyll> joga, type uname -r on the terminal
[05:50] <ab0oo> jrib: tnx.  google wasn't leadning me there.
[05:50] <Cas> joga 2.6.17
[05:50] <joga> degantyll I don't have ubuntu right now, just need to know if it's ok for a certain use
[05:50] <joga> Cas thank you
[05:50] <degantyll> joga, ah allright
[05:50] <jrib> ab0oo: you could also use debuild if you wanted too, but the command given there is just as fine for that
[05:50] <joga> thank you
[05:51] <SilentDis> quick question:  Currently running Dapper here, got Beryl running as well.  I'll be upgrading via the DVD once they get here.  should I disable/remove beryl before performing the upgrade?
[05:51] <ab0oo> jrib: I'll look into debuild, but this is what I needed tonight
[05:51] <ab0oo> tnx
[05:52] <strabes> SilentDis: I believe so.
[05:52] <SbCl3> could my problem be that this is a music CD and not a data cd?
[05:52] <jrib> ab0oo: np, if you care to learn more about packaging visit the MOTU page on ubuntu wiki
[05:52] <strabes> SilentDis: i believe you're supposed to remove beryl before the upgrade. not sure though. just remember something from a forum or w/e.
[05:53] <SilentDis> strabes:  aargh, figures.  just got it just the way I wanted it rofl.  ah well, that'll save headaches at least, thank you :)
[05:54] <noodles12> jrib: hey can i send u my old maple assignment and can you send me back the text? i open it in a text editor and i get a lot of trash

[05:55] <Lovloss> oh thats for DV videos. I want to edit 3D animations i made
[05:55] <SbCl3> what is the command for creating an ISO from an audio CD? "cat /dev/cdrom > aoeu.iso" doesn't seem to be working
[05:55] <GenNMX> Keyseir: Did you search for Chess in Synaptic?
[05:56] <bitflip> SbCl3: mksiofs
[05:56] <Keyseir> GenNMX, There's a lot of stuff in there, and some of it isn't useful for what I'm looking for. So, I thought I'd ask for a Person Reference.
[05:56] <bitflip> SbCl3: err, mkisofs
[05:56] <strabes> Keyseir: yahoo! chess
[05:56] <SbCl3> yahoo! chess sucks :/
[05:56] <stelt> Lovloss, there's an open source movie made with Blender3d and a range of other tools. look it up and see the tools
[05:57] <strabes> SbCl3: it lets you play over the internet with friends; exactly what he was looking for =\

[06:04] <||bass> it was friendly until someone started getitng upset over an ident name

[06:04] <abarbaccia> holycow: now im going to try the cvs version and see if anything is different
[06:04] <loca|host> snapple, you've got two drives hda and hdb, do an fdisk -l /dev/hda and then hdb

[06:04] <holycow> oh try something else

[06:06] <||bass> then stop personally calling an op over it
[06:06] <abarbaccia> holycow: i also have this problem with firefox uploading files via http in addition to just mounting the ftp on my filesystem and accessing it that way
[06:06] <abarbaccia> holycow: so im beginning to think its more than the client
[06:06] <snapple> well, for /dev/hdb I get a: This doesn't look like a partition table
[06:06] <holycow> abarbaccia, oh really?
[06:06] <holycow> abarbaccia, what about downloading large files?
[06:07] <holycow> just curious if its both ways
[06:07] <abarbaccia> holycow: no issue
[06:07] <holycow> the its not a hardware issue ... hmm
[06:08] <holycow> abarbaccia, i'm not sure what to suggest, i was thinking that it might of been a hardware issue
[06:08] <abarbaccia> same here
[06:08] <holycow> i've had occasional intermittent hardware issues kinda do things like this
[06:08] <abarbaccia> which is why im trying newer drivers
[06:09] <holycow> abarbaccia, not a bad idea.  try konqueror browser as well ... it might be a toolkit/library related thing

[06:11] <holycow> abarbaccia, good point .. .you know you got me there.  i'm not sure what to suggest ... sorry dude
[06:11] <snapple> since dmesg says "hdb: unkown partition table"
[06:11] <SbCl3> this is just for audio cds
[06:11] <snapple> funny thing is, windows mounts it fine :/
[06:12] <abarbaccia_> holycow: im testing some things with buffer sizes and queuing tx packets
[06:13] <||bass> you should try opening the disk in gparted and make some insignifigant change to the partition like change the volume label
[06:13] <||bass> see if it fixes it

[06:15] <burepe> it is bumpy
[06:15] <||bass> burepe, not every font has japanese in it
[06:15] <||bass> if the font you select doesnt have japanese in it
[06:15] <burepe> yeah so which ones do
[06:15] <burepe> exactly
[06:16] <sc4ttrdbr4in> burepe: but if you use japanese font(like mincho etc) it will change

So I am wondering what other ways can I use my server without having to have a monitor or keyboard. W
[06:25] <sc4ttrdbr4in> nol13: sorry i thought k3b support it
[06:26] <nol13> slept, i installed mdf2iso but it said file size is to large (2 gig file)
[06:26] <slept> hmm, do you have enough space ?
[06:26] <lkthomas> out of topic question, if I am using 123.64.229.64/29, does the gateway should be 123.64.229.65 or 123.64.229.1 ?
[06:26] <sc4ttrdbr4in> burepe: try freenx
[06:27] <francis> im running ubuntu 5.10..can this be use as internet server or a proxy? how?
[06:27] <noodles12> i woudl also like to know if you can use a laptop with only one nic as a server/router/firewall for your network
[06:27] <IdleOne> installing kubuntu-desktop will install kde?
[06:27] <sc4ttrdbr4in> francis: yes, install apache
[06:28] <francis> apche? is that another form of OS
[06:28] <burepe> sc4ttrdbr4in: do I run that on the server or my main computer,? My main comp is a mac.
[06:29] <Cas> francis: I would recommend you to update to dapper. but to stay on topic, I think you want to make a NAT gateway to share your internet with other computers right?
[06:29] <IdleOne> burepe freenx is good but there will be a lag time
[06:29] <burepe> IdleOne: yes but your log in will change to ked's interface unless you pick gnome
[06:29] <lance_> burepe, do both machines use linux? xdmcp. Or you could use a kvm (keyboard video mouse) switch. heh
[06:29] <IdleOne> burepe,  Thank you
[06:30] <burepe> lance_ the server is ubuntu the other is mac
[06:30] <francis> yes
[06:30] <francis> thnks cas
[06:30] <burepe> what is a keyboard video switch?
[06:30] <IdleOne> burepe,  to remove kubuntu-desktop if I dont like it for whatever reason how would I do that?
[06:31] <francis> but waht is dapper? this my first time to use this..and im still gathering some reading materials to find out
[06:31] <lance_> a physical switch that switches a mouse/keyboard/monitor, between two or more computers ;o
[06:31] <burepe> you do the apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop
[06:31] <IdleOne> burepe,  Thank you again
[06:31] <burepe> if your log in changes to kde and you just want to change it back to gnome you can do the install ubuntu-desktop and it will reset it
[06:32] <IdleOne> I need one of them switches hehe
[06:32] <francis> can u give me a link for the newbies

[06:33] <burepe> lance_ my main comp is a imac so the monitor is part of the comp. Can I use something like that with the mac?

[06:40] <burepe> what is the name of the folder?
[06:40] <IdleOne> open terminal type find drupal
[06:40] <nmc> i dont know
[06:40] <burepe> I have experience with drupal but not in ubuntu
[06:40] <sc4ttrdbrain> nmc: you can check in synaptic, look for installed files/folder of drupal
[06:40] <nmc> how ?
[06:41] <slept> burepe, folders are acctually directories which are files
[06:41] <burepe> search drupal and see what comes up?
[06:41] <sc4ttrdbrain> nmc: when u select drupal package, there dhould be info in synaptic, or u can try "locate drupal"
[06:41] <nmc> no such file or directory
[06:41] <burepe> slept:  what do you mean? that I should say directory and not folder?
[06:42] <||bass> it doesnt matter
[06:42] <||bass> a directory and a folder are two words for the same thing

[06:49] <nmc> i try ln -s /usr/share/drupal /var/www
[06:49] <Frijolie> I have to say that I'm a new Linux noob...but overall i have to say my migration to Linux has been great so far!
[06:49] <Frijolie> I'm definately a fan of Linux and it's OS
[06:50] <IdleOne> LADoctor, xubuntu
[06:50] <SuMarDi> hi... how can i set gnome-dock to my startup program?
[06:50] <sc4ttrdbrain> burepe: what do u want actually? i confused
[06:50] <LADoctor> do i use standard of special
[06:50] <nmc> sc4tt wow the drupal folder is now in the var/www/directory
[06:50] <firebird619> sc4ttrdbrain: I have tried that, but no luck. I also tried 915resolution, but the output of 915resolution -l does not list 1680x1050, but it does list 1600x1200 and 1920x1440.
[06:50] <burepe> I want not messed up japanese fonts.
[06:50] <Madpilot> Spisters, there is one built in; if you need a GUI front-end for it, install firestarter. But Ubuntu also has no open ports or active services by default, so it doesn't really need a firewall
[06:50] <burepe> the default was not level and mincho looks bad
[06:50] <aztracker1> don't suppose anyone in here knows xml + xpath?
[06:51] <burepe> just a nice simple font
[06:51] <firebird619> sc4ttrdbrain: So I would think it would support 1680x1050, beings it lists up to 1920x1440.
[06:51] <Spisters> I need to open a port, how can I do that?
[06:51] <sc4ttrdbrain> firebird619: : when u do that there should be option of available screen reso. if not then i dont know
[06:52] <sc4ttrdbrain> burepe: : then japanese font in repo should be enough
[06:52] <Spisters> thank you for the help by the way, I am a windows to Mac/Linux converter who can now say does not run a single Microsoft program!
[06:52] <Madpilot> Spisters, install firestarter, it's a nice graphical front-end and makes port management easy
[06:52] <firebird619> sc4ttrdbrain: Unfortunately it doesn't list that 1680x1050. Thanks for the help.
[06:52] <||bass> 1680x1050 is an unusual resolution
[06:53] <Spisters> thank you very much, I will search for it on the program installer, that program by the way kicks serious ass
[06:53] <burepe> which one though. I'm working on it. I'll tell you in a few.
[06:53] <sc4ttrdbrain> Spisters: :sudo apt-get install firestarter

[06:54] <IdleOne> no problem
[06:54] <||bass> you can start by going to sound under preferences
[06:54] <xavice> Preferences?
[06:54] <sc4ttrdbrain> burepe: there should be more than enough, but i forgot the name, im not in ubuntu
[06:54] <||bass> and making sure that your actual sound card is selected as the default device
[06:54] <xavice> Oh, I have a blackbox interface.
[06:54] <||bass> and not some random thing
[06:54] <||bass> oh
[06:55] <xavice> gnome
[06:55] <Spisters> you guys rock, thanks a tone
[06:55] <||bass> under gnome

[06:55] <||bass> the sound icon
[06:55] <xavice> Let me run GNOME right now.
[06:55] <||bass> make sure in the sound panel that the default sound card is your actual sound card
[06:55] <||bass> i know for me, i had to change it
[06:55] <xavice> Bah.. Do you have a solution under BlackBox?
[06:56] <||bass> because it made some random weird thing my default card
[06:56] <prax2> hello. Anyone know if it is possible to make Nvidia Geforce 6100 on ubuntu. Please suggest
[06:56] <||bass> i dont, someone else might
[06:56] <burepe>  The problem is that the Japanese that says "this is a test" in the font setting section does not have chinese charecters in it so you can not tell if it is messed up like the defalut font. I wonder is there a way that I can change the "this is a test" text?

[07:46] <AltrdBeast> i have edgy on a thinkpad
[07:47] <AltrdBeast> wired network worked out of the box
[07:47] <AltrdBeast> after typing in my ssid (wouldn't search for it)
[07:47] <AltrdBeast> wireless worked, although it seemed DNS looksups were a bit slow
[07:47] <AltrdBeast> but now, it seems that any tcp packet is being dropped
[07:48] <AltrdBeast> for both wired and wireless connections
[07:48] <AltrdBeast> i say tcp only, because I can ping servers
[07:48] <AltrdBeast> but anything http hangs
[07:48] <AltrdBeast> using both firefox and curl
[07:48] <AltrdBeast> i have no idea how to troubleshoot this
[07:48] <AltrdBeast> everything looks good
[07:48] <ct12am> What is the best way to give my user root priveleges, kubuntu dapper
[07:49] <ct12am> Because my sound pooped out
[07:49] <ct12am> And it's permissions
[07:49] <AltrdBeast> i'm allocated an ip, but it just doesn't do anything
[07:49] <ct12am> And I wield chmod like a jock
[07:49] <ct12am> tonight
[07:49] <AltrdBeast> ideas?
[07:49] <crimsun> ct12am: ls -l /dev/snd/control*
[07:49] <ct12am> thank you sir
[07:49] <crimsun> ct12am: that doesn't give your user root privs; that's diagnostic info for me.
[07:50] <ct12am> yah, but I didn't know where that was...

[07:50] <ct12am> ct
[07:51] <AltrdBeast> the only thing I did was add a few apps with synaptic
[07:51] <ct12am> I really like ubuntu
[07:51] <AltrdBeast> i think i added vlc, gxine, and totem-xine
[07:51] <ct12am> I started with slackware
[07:51] <crimsun> ct12am: groups ct |grep audio 2>&1 >/dev/null ; echo $?
[07:51] <AltrdBeast> but i've removed them all since, still no difference
[07:51] <ct12am> n
[07:51] <ct12am> N
[07:51] <AltrdBeast> i also periodically get HAL errors on startup (when first logging in)
[07:51] <AltrdBeast> it is likely related
[07:51] <ct12am> oh whoops
[07:51] <ct12am> disregard
[07:51] <crimsun> ct12am: it should return 0 or 1
[07:52] <ct12am> that returned 1
[07:52] <AltrdBeast> nobody has any ideas?
[07:52] <AltrdBeast> no network people out there?
[07:52] <crimsun> ct12am: sudo adduser ct audio
[07:52] <crimsun> ct12am: then log out and back in
[07:52] <AltrdBeast> i was hoping it was just a wireless issue but i just plugged it in and the result is the same
[07:53] <sindrum> i have no idea on the network thing maybe try ubuntuforums...iv had good luck there

[08:33] <crimsun> edylie: that's what I said 20 minutes ago (that it does not exist)

[08:34] <squeakypants> what are xx and yy? 85 and 85?
[08:34] <edylie> so i thought to tune the sysctl
[08:34] <nevermind> i.e.: VertSync 60
[08:34] <nevermind> or VertSync 60-85

[08:38] <Moodles> I've run 'fsck.ext3 -c' (uses badblocks), and it says: "Checking for Bad Blocks(read-only test): done 497".. does that mean it found 497 bad blocks? and what about thhe read only thing, did it only check but not fix?

[08:40] <Corbeaux> oh
[08:40] <AltrdBeast> ssh client, not server
[08:40] <nevermind> Moodles: it didn't fixed anything if it was read only
[08:41] <AltrdBeast> you need to get a package from synaptec (apt-get)
[08:41] <AltrdBeast> i think you want to look for openssh-server
[08:41] <TheSneak> g0tw00d, apt-get install openssh-server
[08:41] <g0tw00d> i know that was the command i was asking for I have heard 3 different ones anyone know the right one?
[08:41] <g0tw00d> ty
[08:41] <AltrdBeast> huh?
[08:41] <tonyyarusso> !lamp =~ /install menu/installation process (different in Edgy\+)/

[08:43] <TheSneak> AltrdBeast, it's great... if you want to use a GUI... I do a lot of server admin
[08:43] <TheSneak> hence aptitude is my fav
[08:43] <AltrdBeast> gotcha

[08:44] <kreepy> Hello. does anyone know how to install the 'radeon' xserver driver ? Somehow it doesn't exist in my package list.
[08:44] <TheSneak> I think synaptic uses either aptitude or apt-get behind the scenes
[08:44] <nevermind> najand: well, technically no
[08:44] <AltrdBeast> yeah, pretty sure as well
[08:44] <AltrdBeast> sneak: you see my previous posts about networking issues?
[08:44] <nevermind> najand: it's only a way to read/write into a bloody ms fs
[08:44] <najand> TheSneak: It is apt-get
[08:45] <TheSneak> najand, good call
[08:45] <TheSneak> I like that aptitude remembers which pkgs were installed only to install depends
[08:45] <najand> Hmm... Well, you can read ext2 in Windows
[08:45] <TheSneak> AltrdBeast, no... didn't see them
[08:46] <kreepy> Anyone cares to check if Ubuntu decided to leave out the 'radeon' driver ?. I could'nt find xserver-xorg-video-radeon anywhere.

[08:47] <najand> TheSneak: The problem with Aptitude is that sometimes it is too smart... Too smart for a package manager and install/remove things it does not supposed to
[08:47] <nevermind> the problem is with nautilus actually, since it's terribly slow when i try to access my mounted vfat partition, but it works fine on the tty
[08:47] <timephoenix> just installed Mandriva to dual-boot with Breezy, but it took over my GRUB. I entered and identical entry into the new menu.lst, i can boot but the graphical login does not start by default.
[08:47] <najand> nevermind: if you have just linux, then you can read/write in Ext3
[08:48] <TheSneak> najand, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, but if you mean not respecting dpkg holds... yeah, experienced that
[08:48] <kreepy> !radeon
[08:48] <TheSneak> AltrdBeast, I have a few secs
[08:48] <timephoenix> how do i get graphical login starting automatically again?
[08:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about radeon - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:48] <TheSneak> but I need to register before I can Pm
[08:48] <nevermind> najand: didn't say taht i have JUST linux :P
[08:49] <kreepy> timephoenix: Enable gdm on boot.
[08:49] <AltrdBeast> sneak: I think I'm registered, not sure how I'm registered, but I am ;)
[08:49] <nevermind> najand: my problem is that hen i open the folder where the vfat is mounted on, takes like 5 mins until i see it's content
[08:49] <najand> nevermind: then freedesktop, still, is experiencing issues need time to be  remove... Give them some time
[08:49] <AltrdBeast> phoenix: look at grub config
[08:50] <nevermind> najand: sry, i dunno know what you mean
[08:50] <AltrdBeast> sneak: you gonna register?
[08:50] <TheSneak> AltrdBeast, trying
[08:50] <sc4ttrbrain> nevermind: are you trying to open folder which contain lots of files?
[08:50] <AltrdBeast> great
[08:50] <AltrdBeast> i guess my irc client auto-registers?
[08:50] <malt1> what is a good home router with 32 mb of memory thats wired/wired?
[08:50] <nevermind> sc4ttrbrain: nope, it's the vfat root
[08:50] <timephoenix> a quick check under GNOME/admin/services shows GDM ticked
[08:51] <najand> nevermind: Do you have preview options on?
[08:51] <kreepy> (sighhhh) will anyone check if the "xserver-xorg-video-radeon" even exist in the package tree ? I remembered I did have installed that before, but now I couldn't find it.
[08:51] <nevermind> najand: no, i disable them with no luck, but it worked before with them anyway
[08:51] <TheSneak> AltrdBeast, did you get my PM/

[08:58] <adamdunn> i have a question that somebody else has already asked, but in a month has gone unreplied: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=281493
[08:58] <najand> nevermind: Hmm... Maybe backuping .nautilus and removing the folder can check if it is a nautiilus problem or  mount?
[08:59] <adamdunn> i was wondering if anybody knows the answer (the question as worded by the other person seems clear enough that I shouldn't have to restate it)
[08:59] <nevermind> najand: ok, i'll try that, but it does the same on every user (root and mine)
[08:59] <dream> hello????
[09:00] <nevermind> najand: and it doesn't work that way (slow), when i read the vfat with the terminal (ls, finde, etc)
[09:00] <dream> hi nevermind
[09:00] <najand> Hmm.. Then it is not a mount problem
[09:00] <nevermind> najand: let me look now
[09:01] <dream> hi najand
[09:01] <dream> hi nevermind
[09:01] <nevermind> najand: nope, same thing, it's not a .nautilus thing
[09:01] <nevermind> hi dream
[09:01] <najand> nevermind: I see
[09:01] <dream> hello nevermind, how can i add a new ipaddress in GUI mode?
[09:01] <najand> Hmm... Have you tried reinstalling nautilus?
[09:02] <najand> nevermind:Hmm... Have you tried reinstalling nautilus?
[09:02] <nevermind> najand: was about to do that lol

[09:06] <najand> nevermind: why do you need to remove nautilus?
[09:07] <nevermind> najand: i like having reinstalled things from scratch
[09:07] <Madpilot> nevermind, in Gnome, Nautilus controls the desktop icons as well as being the file manager
[09:07] <Gonzo> FUCK THE GOVERNMENT!
[09:07] <nevermind> Madpilot: i know i was just joking :P
[09:07] <adamdunn> Corbeaux: do you think it could be partitions that aren't mounted? Did the discrepancy equal a partition that wasn't mounted on the raid5?
[09:07] <najand> Gonzo: Watch your mouth!
[09:07] <Madpilot> Gonzo, go away
[09:07] <Gonzo> sorry...
[09:07] <najand> nevermind: OK, then
[09:08] <foutrelis> Hello. I use Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft and sometimes application crash. Firefox crashes quite a lot. Does it happen to you as well?
[09:08] <solid_liq> has anyone gotten the ati proprietary drivers working in edgy?
[09:08] <solid_liq> foutrelis: my experience with 6.10 hasn't been good.  If you're new to ubuntu, I recommend you reinstall with 6.06 LTS
[09:08] <solid_liq> foutrelis: a lot of stuff in 6.10 is broken
[09:09] <najand> solid_liq: What is broken there?
[09:09] <nevermind> najand: nope, still the same after reinstall :(
[09:09] <lykinsbd> solid_liq: have you checked out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ?  That got it running right for me
[09:09] <solid_liq> lykinsbd: it didn't work for me
[09:09] <Corbeaux> adamdunn I don't remember specifics but I remember one being 2x the size of the other and yes it was an unmounted ~10GB partition
[09:09] <foutrelis> solid_liq, so I have read. That the stable one is 6.06. I really like 6.10 though.
[09:10] <solid_liq> lykinsbd: I upgraded in place by net from dapper
[09:10] <najand> nevermind: Hmm... Maybe there is something wrong with your Video Card Setting
[09:10] <solid_liq> lykinsbd: I can't even seem to get the ati installer to build a package for edgy
[09:10] <foutrelis> Well X-Chat crashes too when I close it.. I dunno. Maybe its just me :(
[09:10] <nevermind> najand: what does the video card has to do?
[09:11] <lykinsbd> solid_liq: hmm I had a bit of trouble with my restricted-packages modules matching up to my kernel versions, but other than that it went smoothly...
[09:11] <kuzmaster> hey, a quick question, what will "apt-get install quota" install, and what does that do?
[09:11] <najand> nevermind: Maybe during loading of some icons in your  hd?
[09:11] <solid_liq> lykinsbd: from the installer, --buildpkg Ubuntu/edgy
[09:12] <solid_liq> dpkg-parsechangelog: error: cannot open debian/changelog to find format: No such file or directory
[09:12] <solid_liq> dpkg-buildpackage: unable to determine source package is

[09:12] <s4ltydog> hey malt1 are you malty?
[09:12] <malt1> sup
[09:12] <malt1> yeah
[09:12] <kuzmaster> what will "apt-get install quota" install, and what does that do?
[09:12] <najand> Sorry guys I have to go
[09:12] <nevermind> najand: hardly, since they're the same icons as for any other file in any other folder
[09:12] <sc4ttrbrain> !quota
[09:12] <ubotu> quota: implementation of the disk quota system. In component main, is optional. Version 3.13-8 (edgy), package size 393 kB, installed size 1196 kB
[09:12] <najand> nevermind: Hmm...
[09:12] <nevermind> k, thanx and cya
[09:12] <kuzmaster> thanx
[09:12] <najand> I will think about it
[09:13] <najand> Bye
[09:13] <nevermind> ;)
[09:13] <foutrelis> One other thing. When I used Automatix to make my life easier it switched my system to 386 kernel. I then changed it back to generic (nothing too hard. Just booting from grub in generic). Is generic better for a i686 system?
[09:13] <solid_liq> kuzmaster: it's for putting limits on how much space each user may consume on the hdd
[09:13] <kuzmaster> k, thanx
[09:13] <Dheeraj_k> guys how do u rate Lite-on dvdrw over asus?
[09:13] <kuzmaster> its not really neaded then...........
[09:13] <s4ltydog> Dheeraj_k Ive had a lite-on crap out on me...
[09:14] <bray> Lite-on is crap. Go with the Asus
[09:14] <burepe> I am setting up a lamp server and the directions say "You may want your current user to be the PHP pages administrator. To do so, edit the Apache configuration file :
[09:14] <burepe> $ gksudo "gedit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf"
[09:14] <burepe> Search both the strings starting by "User" and "Group", and change the names by the current username and groupname you are using. Then you'll need to restart Apache. (look at the next chapter concerning apache commands) " What is my group name?
[09:14] <solid_liq> Dheeraj_k: I've had good luck with Lite-on
[09:14] <sc4ttrbrain> kuzmaster: its needed when you host websites
[09:14] <lykinsbd> solid_liq:  you got me there, sorry I don't know what would help you
[09:14] <s4ltydog> Yah Asus, i've never had an asus dvd but they seem to make good stuff
[09:14] <kuzmaster> yeah, well, im gonna host an intranet, but, yeah, its not really needed is it?
[09:14] <solid_liq> lykinsbd: k, thanks anyway
[09:15] <Dheeraj_k> s4ltydog: i had very bad experience with samsung
[09:15] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: your group name is your user name
[09:15] <foutrelis> I had an Asus Cd-Writer and it broke :(
[09:15] <dream> nevermind:  thank you all the same :)
[09:15] <solid_liq> anyone know how to fix this problem?  dpkg-parsechangelog: error: cannot open debian/changelog to find format: No such file or directory
[09:15] <foutrelis> But shit happens..
[09:15] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: and my username is my username?
[09:15] <s4ltydog> Dheeraj_k: weird, i like samsung
[09:15] <burepe> sorry and user is my username?
[09:15] <sc4ttrbrain> yes
[09:15] <Dheeraj_k> samsung,lg,liteon,asus,sony
[09:16] <FreeNet> ok... scenario here pls aid me... *I boot up a linux, CENTOS (without monitor and keyboard, 'remote' system). I use Putty to connect to it through it's static ip... i type the password etc... and manage to get into console... does that mean the linux is already logon? becuase i am not able to coonect using my VNC viewer to connect remotely
[09:16] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: thanks.
[09:16] <s4ltydog> They have all crapped out on you?
[09:16] <foutrelis> lol
[09:16] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: but i did it th eother way
[09:16] <FreeNet> sorry i have to result in asking here.
[09:16] <solid_liq> FreeNet: it's because your x server isn't running
[09:16] <Dheeraj_k> may be i should go 4 something diff sony?
[09:16] <foutrelis> I now have an LG cd writer.. I like it :)
=== s|k_ is now known as s|k
[09:17] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: i would use www-data as user and group name
[09:17] <kuzmaster> freenet:hmmm......... its a good one, just try running a vnc client and see if you can connect to it
[09:17] <bray> I'm suck with the cd writer that came with my laptop
[09:17] <s4ltydog> Dheeraj_k: I have two sony's and they work like a charm (well...mostly), but lite-on was crappy to me..
[09:17] <kuzmaster> freenet: or, just try running the vnc server through ssh
[09:17] <FreeNet> solid_liq>	am i log onto the linux?
[09:17] <Dheeraj_k> foutrelis: u may face problem with inject
[09:17] <nevermind> k, i'll go, tnx
[09:17] <kuzmaster> freenet: putty is a ssh client
[09:17] <foutrelis> Dheeraj_k: ?
[09:17] <solid_liq> FreeNet: try typing startx in putty
[09:17] <Juhaz> generalized over the time, they're all the same crap. some invidual drive models may be better than others, but in the end, the manufacturer doesn't have any bearing on it.
[09:17] <noiesmo> bray, buy an external dvd burner a mates got one works great in ubuntu
[09:18] <Dheeraj_k> eject
[09:18] <solid_liq> FreeNet: not sure if it'll work though
[09:18] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: so I would use that instead of a personal user name, like say, burepe?
[09:18] <foutrelis> Dheeraj_k: With the LG writer?
[09:18] <bray> noiesmo: You know, I never thought about getting an external burner... I'll have to look into that
[09:18] <solid_liq> FreeNet: get your company to pay for nxserver, it'll be worth it
[09:18] <sc4ttrbrain> yup, i think u want to look at howtoforge.com for safe configuration
[09:18] <FreeNet> solid_liq>	startx shows fatal error server is already active for display 0
[09:19] <noiesmo> bray, ;)
[09:19] <Dheeraj_k> still confused oO
[09:19] <kuzmaster> is quota absolutly needed for running a intranet?
[09:19] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: If I add a new user named www-data will the group automatically be the same?
[09:19] <FreeNet> it's a startup company no money to invest on it just yet.
[09:19] <Dheeraj_k> foutrelis: yeah that is common in lg/samsung
[09:19] <solid_liq> FreeNet: ah, so you have it in runlevel 5, but the gdm is running, not gnome
[09:19] <foutrelis> burepe, ,  yes
[09:19] <burepe> cool
[09:19] <burepe> thanks
[09:19] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: you should change it too
[09:19] <solid_liq> FreeNet: try making it runlevel 3, then type startx
[09:19] <bray> noiesmo: So what do they go for? I imagine it would be a little more than an internal one, but as you can imagine, I'm on a fairly tight budget
[09:19] <foutrelis> Dheeraj_k: I guess I am lucky :P
[09:19] <solid_liq> FreeNet: so type   runlevel 3
[09:20] <Dheeraj_k> foutrelis: from how long u r using it?
[09:20] <noiesmo> bray, not sure what it cost him it was a present from his mother :)
[09:20] <foutrelis> can't remember exactly.. over 6 months I thinkl
[09:20] <foutrelis> *think
[09:20] <FreeNet> kuzmaster> i used ultravnc to connect to localhost:5901 and it gives.... "Connection Failed - Error reading protocol version"
[09:21] <bray> noiesmo: Aha, I see... well, I just hope I get this job I'm looking into. Then I'll actually have a bit of extra cash
[09:21] <Dheeraj_k> wait 4 another 6 or 4 month
[09:21] <kuzmaster> freenet: did you run that on the remote computer, or your computer?
[09:21] <FreeNet> solid_liq>	typed "runlevel 3" it returns "unknown"
[09:21] <foutrelis> Dheeraj_k: :(((( :P
[09:21] <FreeNet> kuzmaster>	run on remote computer
[09:21] <Dheeraj_k> and than u will notice such symptoms
[09:22] <FreeNet> i am doing ssh tunneling
=== intercool_ is now known as intercoo1
[09:22] <foutrelis> Dheeraj_k: Hmm.. did not know
[09:22] <Dheeraj_k> my asus dvd rom is 6 year old :)
[09:22] <noiesmo> bray, well in aussie you can get just the case for the dvd burner for 40$
[09:22] <kuzmaster> freenet: you should run the vnc client the computer, that your using now, and connect to the remote computer
[09:22] <Aura> help
[09:22] <foutrelis> Dheeraj_k: omg. nice !
[09:22] <kuzmaster> if that makes sence :)

[09:22] <Dheeraj_k> and still running fine no eject problem at all
[09:23] <solid_liq> FreeNet: grr, I hadn't realized ubuntu changed the gnu runlevel tool to something else
[09:23] <bray> noiesmo: $40? Huh... well, with my luck (it's very good) I'll be able to find a decent one for a good price. I know where to look for these kinds of tings
[09:23] <bray> *things
[09:23] <foutrelis> Dheeraj_k: Well it was only 25 Euros :P
[09:23] <Dheeraj_k> but it has problem only with scratch disk
[09:23] <FreeNet> kuzmaster yes... i connect to remote linux using putty through port 22 right? then how shd i continue?
[09:24] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: `yourusername` should be your mysql admin username
[09:24] <noiesmo> bray, :)
[09:24] <kuzmaster> freenet: connect to the remote computer using vnc

[09:25] <bray> Hey, I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to Linux in general, but for the past two days I've been trying to figure out how to install Wine and WoW. I finally got Wine installed and running today, but I can't find my disks for WoW... would downloading the client using wowclient-installer.exe in wine work?
[09:25] <foutrelis> oh i see.. hmm
[09:25] <sc4ttrbrain> Aura: just ask
[09:25] <kuzmaster> freenet: unless there on the same port number
[09:26] <foutrelis> hmm.. 21$. not bad :)
[09:26] <SuperQ> bray: heh.. WoW
[09:26] <FreeNet> kuzmaster>	i am currently following an example from http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Tunnel_VNC_over_ssh using tunneling...
[09:26] <kuzmaster> freenet: remember, usually, im on the other end of this convo (usually i need help), but, i feel i know what im talking about............
[09:26] <SuperQ> bray: if you're new to linux, you probably want to buy Cedega support
[09:27] <kuzmaster> freenet: well, hmmmmmmmmm............ i suppose follow the instructions on that.................... ummmm....... ive never done that before, so, i cant really help you there.... sorry
[09:27] <FreeNet> ok nvm
[09:27] <foutrelis> Bye! Have a nice day :)
[09:27] <SuperQ> ugh.. my brain is shutting down
[09:27] <bray> SuperQ: Ain't got the money for Cedega, and Wine is easy enough to use. There are how-tos on just about everything including WoW. It says to copy the files from all the disks into a folder and do wine installer.exe, but like I said, I don't have my disks.
[09:28] <warlock> is there a way to find a line in all files in a dir? ex in /home/dir/files/ I want to find a line called "I/love/something" in all of the files?
[09:28] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: sorry I don't follow. You said "I would user www-data as the user and group name" I thought I would add the user with that command, but then you said that that comand was for setting the admin. What am i missing? What should "www-data" be?
[09:28] <SuperQ> bray: oh.. I guess I've never tried it
[09:28] <bray> SuperQ: Huh... well I'll give it a shot and see what happens
[09:28] <kuzmaster> freenet:so, is this computer on the same network as you, or, are you trying to connect to it over the internet?
[09:29] <SuperQ> warlock: yes
[09:29] <FreeNet> local network
[09:29] <markybob> i cant figure out how to let apache launch something into X.  i keep getting "AUDIT: Mon Dec  4 03:21:17 2006: 5368 X: client 3 rejected from local host"   any ideas?
[09:29] <lykinsbd> bray:  if update downloads will work I assume downloading the client would too
[09:29] <Corbeaux> warlock grep string /home/dir/*
[09:29] <warlock> hmm
[09:29] <warlock> but the string is..? :P
[09:29] <Pie-rate> yarr, installing ubuntu on my gaming box.
[09:29] <bray> lykinsbd: You can't always be so sure, ya know?
[09:29] <Corbeaux> string is what you're looking for
[09:29] <warlock> oh ok
[09:29] <SuperQ> warlock: you want grep -r
[09:30] <warlock> grep -r string /home/dir/something/* ?
[09:30] <Pie-rate> ubotu, tell pie-rate about nvidia
[09:30] <kuzmaster> freenet:hmmmmmmmmmmmm well, i cant really see a reason to tunnell it over SSH, but, that is just what i think
[09:30] <Corbeaux> -r goes down into sub directories i think?
[09:30] <lykinsbd> bray: oh I know, just wishful thinking that it succedes cause I'll probably be doing the same thing if it works :O)
[09:30] <SuperQ> warlock: correct
[09:30] <bray> wine: could not load L"c:\\windows\\system32\\wowclient-installer.exe": Module not found
[09:30] <kuzmaster> freenet: then again, somtimes, i have a DMZ open to my computer, with only the windows firewall running, and no antivirus and such
[09:30] <bray> lykinsbd: Dang, didn't work...
[09:30] <warlock> root@zkillz:/home/hltv# grep -r wtv/demos /var/www/wtv/*
[09:30] <warlock> nothing..
[09:31] <FreeNet> i know.... i am testing out
[09:31] <warlock> does it mean it found nothing?
[09:31] <sidny4> how do I get current upgrades for dapper from the command line?
[09:31] <SuperQ> warlock: correct
[09:31] <Corbeaux> correct
[09:31] <warlock> ok, thanks - found it now ;)
[09:31] <warlock> appreciate it lots
[09:31] <SuperQ> warlock: cool
[09:31] <sidny4> isn't it like dist-upgrade or something?
[09:31] <kuzmaster> sidny4: think its like sudo apt-get upgrage
[09:31] <warlock> soem php bug, can't find the error, making me go nuts
[09:31] <SuperQ> warlock: you might want to quote the string tho
[09:31] <warlock> oh ok
[09:31] <SuperQ> warlock: like grep -r 'wtv/demos' ...
[09:31] <Corbeaux> another one i use that's not as nice is : cat /home/dir/files |grep string
[09:32] <sidny4> there it is, thanks kuxmaster
[09:32] <thedado> how can I remove a package ? i use sudo apt-get --purge remove foo and that keeps failing, is there another way ?
[09:32] <warlock> gah, still can't find what i'm looking for, :P
[09:32] <SuperQ> Corbeaux: but of course, that won't tell you which filenames matched
[09:32] <noiesmo> thedado, apt-get -f install or maybe try apt-get install --fix-missing might help
[09:33] <SuperQ> warlock: read the grep man page
[09:33] <Corbeaux> that's why it's not as nice :p
[09:33] <bray> sudo apt-get remove <package>
[09:33] <SuperQ> warlock: "man grep?
[09:33] <SuperQ> erm
[09:33] <SuperQ> warlock: "man grep"
[09:33] <warlock> found it ;)
[09:33] <warlock> thanks a BUNCH!
[09:33] <SuperQ> np
[09:33] <SuperQ> now for sleep
[09:33] <highneko> what's the best and safest way to shutdown from a terminal?
[09:33] <g0tw00d> why does my USB mouse lock up in Ubuntu from time to time and replugging it in fixes it?
[09:33] <warlock> Though, this aint the place to ask (sorry for it) - but do you know php perhaps SuperQ?
[09:34] <noiesmo> the system highneko
[09:34] <noiesmo> highneko, shutdown -h now
[09:34] <bray> g0tw00d: You may need to get drivers for it
[09:34] <noiesmo> highneko, sudo if not root
[09:34] <g0tw00d> where would I start....lol ....<---new to ubuntu
[09:34] <highneko> noiesmo: Ok, thank you.

[09:35] <Pie-rate> W00t, Ubuntu install just finished on my gaming box, i'm eager to see how well games will run with wine on a geforce 7800gt

[09:36] <wizo> hey, when i do apt-get install irssi, it asks me to insert a drapper disk or something, is there anyway i can get around this?
[09:36] <bray> g0tw00d: Do you know the model number?
[09:36] <Pie-rate> wine+WoW didn't work out too well on my ATI radeon xpress 1100, i still don't know if thats because my ati drivers arent working or if i just suck at setting wine up

[09:42] <lordmaynoth2> does anyone know how to access it
[09:43] <bray> g0tw00d: I can't seem to find it... go to the dell website and try searching all the numbers you can find, and if all else fails, try searching for the product (eg. Dell P990)
[09:43] <noiesmo> khaije1, maybe check this http://www.linux.org/hardware/
[09:43] <trelayne> lordmaynoth2:  do df -k
[09:43] <trelayne> so to see what you have
[09:43] <g0tw00d> Do they offer what I need?
[09:43] <noiesmo> khaije1, if it works for linux should be workable for ubuntu
[09:43] <khaije1> k, which was the one you said worked for you?
[09:44] <bray> g0tw00d: I'm not sure. They might. If not, I'll go look through the forums and the wiki to see if I can find anything about mice

[09:46] <edan> trelayne: what should i change?

[09:47] <trelayne> lordmaynoth2:  sorry dude.. I think it's out of my league right now.. so you say that you put it in it's own partition?

[10:03] <usr13> bray: I just did, and didn't find anything.
[10:03] <Pie-rate> I have a problem with nvidia drivers, when i install as per these (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia) instructions, it says "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel." after i type "nvidia-glx-config enable"
[10:03] <arnonym> xen: did you check the mixer if e.g. the mic input is enabled?
[10:03] <bray> usr13, try taking a little more time with it. You might also try the forums (http://www.ubuntuforums.com) and see what you come up with. That's what I'm doing
[10:04] <Corbeaux> xen i've never bothered getting audio to work under linux since i've never used it as my desktop (always as a remote server), hence I wouldn't know where to start helping you
[10:04] <kuzmaster> this is a quickie again......
[10:04] <xen> arnonym, by going into alsamixer and pushing the mic column all the way down?
[10:04] <kuzmaster> how do i check/change my hostname?
[10:05] <arnonym> xen: yes
[10:05] <bimberi> !hostname | kuzmaster
[10:05] <ubotu> kuzmaster: Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[10:05] <Corbeaux> kuzmaster vi /etc/hostname
[10:05] <Pie-rate> I think its because i have a generic kernel image. How do i change that?
[10:05] <xen> arnonym, do the changes take affect immediately, or do I need to exit, or do I need to reboot?
[10:05] <kuzmaster> thanks
[10:05] <sc4ttrbrain> !png2usplash
[10:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about png2usplash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:05] <arnonym> xen: the changes take affect immediately
[10:05] <anurag02> !kernel
[10:05] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[10:06] <Lovloss> this thing wont compile. Says it cant find "a working libguile"
[10:06] <sc4ttrbrain> !usplash
[10:06] <xen> arnonym, I dragged mic down, no change in sound quality
[10:06] <ubotu> usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[10:06] <arnonym> xen: try the other sources
[10:07] <Pie-rate> What is a generic kernel image and how do i install a non-generic one?
[10:07] <umista> how do i switch between users
[10:07] <Lovloss> does anyone know how to find a "libguile"?
[10:07] <umista> i keep hitting shift backspace
[10:07] <usr13> There must be a place to change Firefox's file associations but I can't seem to find it.  Does anyone know where they've moved it to?
[10:07] <Corbeaux> su - username
[10:07] <anurag02> in packages.ubuntulinux.org
[10:07] <arnonym> lovloss: apt-cache search libguile
[10:07] <xen> arnonym, aside from volume changing, the quality remains the same...
[10:08] <Lovloss> ah! cool! thanks
[10:08] <wizo> now that i have install fluxbox, how can i make it start fluxbox when i type startx or somethign
[10:08] <bray> I can't hear audio on YouTube. Anyone know why that might be and how to fix it?
[10:08] <sc4ttrbrain> usr13: in contents tab?
[10:09] <wizo> otherwise when in most cases i want it to just boot in console mode, and only start flux when i want
[10:09] <gavintu> wizo: What dm are you using?
[10:10] <xen> arnonym, no other ideas?
[10:10] <arnonym> xen: are there switches for analog/digital output? i do not know how there are displayed in alsamixer, i used the kde mixer for that
[10:11] <warlock> How to see all rights the files have in a dir?
[10:11] <usr13> sc4ttrbrain: I've looked all over in "Contents", but have yet to find it.
[10:11] <umista> how to switch users
[10:11] <sc4ttrbrain> warlock: ls -lia
[10:11] <bray> Well peeps, I'm off to bed for the night. Good luck to all those who need help and thank you to all those who are helping

[10:14] <wizo> oh err...
[10:14] <wizo> is flux a dm?

[10:15] <umista> gdm

[10:15] <wizo> oh, i don't think i have installed one yet
[10:15] <gavintu> Or are you logging in through console?
[10:15] <wizo> yea, im currently just logging into console
[10:15] <Corbeaux> didn't he say startx earlier?
[10:15] <gavintu> thats not a dm

[10:15] <Pie-rate> How do i get my 4th and 5th mouse buttons working? they dont seem to be functioning as back and forward buttons in firefox
[10:15] <gavintu> wizo: doesn't just typing "fluxbox" work?
[10:16] <burepe> ok, the Japanese font that the Japanese version uses is not in the repositories. I found the site where it is hosted in a .tar.gz package. How do I install this font? Just double click it?
[10:16] <wizo> gavintu, i just tried that, it says that it couldnt connects to Xserver
[10:16] <usr13> sc4ttrbrain: The Firefox selection box if greyed out in the updates window.  Why is that?
[10:17] <gavintu> let me check my startx
[10:17] <usr13> Do we have to manually update Firefox?
[10:17] <sc4ttrbrain> usr13: u update it through synaptic or apt-get
[10:17] <usr13> Delete the ... oh ok.
[10:17] <sc4ttrbrain> usr13: are u using dapper?
[10:18] <usr13> I just tried "apt-get update firefox" and it said:  "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
[10:18] <sc4ttrbrain> usr13: are u using dapper?

[10:20] <sc4ttrbrain> usr13: dapper use 1.5.*
[10:20] <usr13> sc4ttrbrain: Maybe I need to add a repository.
[10:20] <usr13> sc4ttrbrain: is there a later version that Dapper?
[10:20] <sc4ttrbrain> usr13: u can download from the firefox site
[10:21] <xen> arnonym, you know...on an earlier install of edgy, I used automatix, and didn't have this problem.  But I didn't do that on this install, because I'd been told automatix is messy.  Is there a way to see what automatix installed, without actually using the bugger?
[10:21] <ernz> Never mind - Fixed it
[10:21] <gavintu> wizo: fluxbox should work as a first parameter to startx. to run it automatically you have to edit the xinit resource files, i'm trying to find that now
[10:21] <usr13> Well, I didn't want to muck up my system here, but I guess if that's the only way, I'll do it.
[10:22] <umista> wht is the del command
[10:22] <arnonym> xen: sorry, never used automatix
[10:22] <Pie-rate> !automatix
[10:22] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[10:22] <wizo> gavintu, when i type fluxbox in console, it gives me the error saying that it cannot connect to the Xserver, does that mean anything?
[10:23] <wizo> gavin, echo "exec startfluxbox" > ~/.xinitrc ?
[10:23] <gavintu> yes, youre not running X yet. try "startx fluxbox"
[10:23] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: there are no directions to install in the ReadMe
[10:23] <gavintu> maybe that would work too, I use a slightly different setup
[10:23] <wizo> ah i see, lemme tyr startx fluxbox
[10:23] <wizo> brb
[10:23] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: then is there makefile?
[10:23] <anurag02> !fluxbox
[10:23] <ubotu> fluxbox is a lightweight and responsive window manager for GNU/Linux. For how to set it up and more information see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fluxbox

[10:24] <wizo> startx command not found
[10:24] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: where to download it ,i ll have a look
[10:25] <burepe> http://www.geocities.jp/ipa_mona/
[10:25] <wizo> ah i should get a gdm first
[10:25] <gavintu> wizo: You don't need one. Hold on.
[10:25] <umista> whts the command to delete a file from console
[10:26] <gavintu> umista: rm
[10:26] <wizo> gavintu, im reading from here, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems
[10:26] <gavintu> Well feel free to install one. xdm has problems on some computers though.
[10:27] <wizo> oo
[10:27] <umista> can i change grub to start up in a higher res
[10:27] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: try this ./configure
[10:27] <wizo> thanks gavintu
[10:27] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: could you clarify?
[10:28] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: wait i ll try it now
[10:28] <wizo> hrm, maybe i'll install gdm instead
[10:28] <gavintu> go with wdm
[10:28] <gavintu> its ugly, but at least you know it works
[10:29] <wizo> so many choices :s
[10:29] <gavintu> fluxbuntu is recommending wdm for now
[10:29] <wizo> wdm = World Development Movement lol
[10:29] <shar> hi
[10:30] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: yes, the standart way to install it is ./configure , then, make , then sudo make install, but if ./configure give u error u should correct that error first
[10:30] <wizo> thanks gavintu, i'll try out wdm then

[10:35] <usr13> I installed firefox to /usr/local/firefox  and am starting it from command line now, but wondering if I should change the synlink from /usr/bin/firefox to /usr/local/firefox?  OR, should I mv /usr/local/firefox /user/lib/firefox (and just over-write the old with the new)?
[10:35] <usr13> Which is the preferred method?

[10:36] <burepe> Are you saying I should follow those directions? That is for red hat from 2003. I guess I just need general directions to install any kind of font.

[10:48] <ubotu> To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[10:50] <Pie-rate> Before I installed ubuntu, I made a 13gb fat32 partition and backed some stuff up to it, how would I mount that in ubuntu?
[10:51] <craigp84> Pie-rate, sudo mount /dev/hd## /mnt - where ## is the correct harddisk / partition - e.g. /dev/hda2 - check that it's not already mounted, possibly in /media/hd##
[10:51] <TheGateKeeper> !fstab
[10:51] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file lists all drives and partitions that are mounted on the system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions

[10:52] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: I'm sorry, I don't know how to use those commands
[10:53] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: its just ./configure

[11:04] <achandra> np
[11:04] <the_Grinch> what command would I use to tell apache to start when the computer boots?
[11:04] <gavintu> burepe: I think the reason why Japanese is so wonky is because Ubuntu uses different fonts to display the hiragana, kanji, and katakana. I have no idea why though. Maybe you can change a setting somewhere to use the same font for all three.
[11:04] <kybuz> does anyone use newspost
[11:04] <gareth0> hu
[11:04] <gareth0> is there a channel for grub?
[11:04] <achandra> the_Grinch: the rc.d daemon must invoke /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache
[11:04] <gareth0> can i ask a question about it here?
[11:05] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: the package you re about to istall is the same, it contains  IPA, * * M+

[11:06] <achandra> the_Grinch: by defualt "i think" this is already done when you install it..i believe there is a link in rc.d..

[11:19] <sindrum> im trying firestarter .... not liking the fact that i have to have terminal open to use
[11:20] <evad> firestarter is just a way to control the built-in firewall, iptables.

[11:21] <croppa> if i have installed and used automatix2, can i use sudo apt-get cdrom with the edgy alt cd, then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:21] <achandra> fwbuilder is pretty damn good
[11:21] <croppa> to upgrade dapper to edgy
[11:21] <xzk> frogzoo - i took it off of UTC and the time is displayed correctly now.. but it still crashes if i try to adjust it.. not that i need to now.. but I'm sure when i log back into winxp and then back to linux again it will need adjusting
[11:22] <xzk> frogzoo -  what is openwrt?
[11:22] <Corbeaux> seemsas though your time is being reset by your hardware time
[11:22] <Corbeaux> you should sync them, i forgot the command and have to leave
[11:22] <frogzoo> xzk: it's a linux distro for broadcom chipset wifi routers
[11:22] <xzk> hmm
[11:23] <sindrum> thanks on fwbuilder give that a try
[11:23] <xzk> i think i got my broadcom chip working - havent used it yet but it works better than it did a few days ago.. which was not at all
[11:23] <BeanBag> please help me setting up my wireless driver
[11:23] <frogzoo> xzk: the broadcom wifi cards are crap, but the wifi routers are the shiz
[11:24] <xzk> i want to use airsnort to try and crack my wireless routers encrytption to see how well it worked - anyone have any luck with airsnort?
[11:24] <frogzoo> xzk: kismet
[11:24] <xzk> ?
[11:24] <frogzoo> xzk: google wifi kismet
[11:25] <xzk> BeanBag -  theres 2 good tutorials on the ubuntu forums for getting broadcom wireless drivers to work, thats how i got mine working
[11:25] <xzk> 1 tutorials tells you how to do it step by step.. and the other one does it for you basically
[11:26] <BeanBag> xzk: i tried the one with ndisswrapper, but im not that good with ubuntu yet and it does more harm than good
[11:26] <xzk> more harm?
[11:27] <xzk> did you try the one that has you download a deb file i think.. and it basically does everything for you
[11:27] <xzk> is kismet the best ?
[11:27] <BeanBag> xzk: it disabled by ethernet, or i think i did, not sure. point is it did not work properly for me, is there an easier way?
[11:28] <xzk> see the network icon in the top right, you can click on that and choose which connection you want. eth1 or eth0    ethernet or wifi
[11:28] <sindrum> fwbuilder is not for the newbie...
[11:28] <BeanBag> xzk: i tried this:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4311_rev_01_%28ndiswrapper%29?highlight=%284311%29%7C%28broadcom%29
[11:29] <BeanBag> xzk: but it did not work
[11:29] <duckman0> whats the best way to recert my xorg back to the original settings that it orginally had after i installed the video driver?
[11:29] <xzk> no theres a better one on the forum
[11:29] <warlock> Is there a possibility to have all files in a dir printed out in a .txt file? and remove the extention, ex; I have 200 files called something.txt in /home/dir, and I want these 200 files printed out in files.txt but remove the .txt part off these 200 files?
[11:29] <achandra> sindrum: id read up on it... it is very powerful and beats having to build your own from iptables.
[11:30] <BeanBag> xzk: at top right there is only eth0 and lo
[11:30] <sindrum> yeah im going to just pointing out the fact that its not for the newbie
[11:30] <xzk> click on the eth0 and put in a 1 and it switches for you
[11:30] <duckman0> xorg.conf i keep messing around with it and it already dumped, i wanna just put it back is there a command for that?
[11:30] <sc0tt_> hey folks
[11:31] <mnepton> duckman0: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:31] <BeanBag> xzk: do you have the link to the better one on the forum?
[11:31] <achandra> sindrum: Yeah Id have to agree with you there. Are you simply trying to share your internet connection all while having a firewall?
[11:31] <arne> Hello my name is Arne (Germany). I installed Ubuntu yesterday - everything works fine... But my Plextor PX-716a won't show any content of a dvd-rom! CD-Roms working without any probs... Please help me.
[11:31] <duckman0> mnepton: i already figuered that part out is there somthing els that i can so other then that?
[11:32] <mnepton> warlock: you want the information from each text file put into a new file named file.txt?
[11:32] <xzk> BeanBag -  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=285809
[11:32] <BeanBag> xzk: eth1: interface does not exist, that is what i get when i try to type it in
[11:32] <mnepton> duckman0: that's the recommended way to reconfigure X
[11:32] <xzk> BeanBag -  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102
[11:32] <duckman0> mnepton: ok thanks
[11:32] <boink> arne: you need to install the codecs
[11:33] <arne> what codecs?
[11:33] <boink> the dvd codecs
[11:33] <sindrum> achandra: this is correct
[11:33] <boink> libdvdcss

[11:33] <warlock> No mnepton, I want all files listed in /my/dir to be printed out in files.txt, so ex let's say we have file1.rar and file2.rar in /my/dir I want it to show file1,file2 listed under eachother in files.txt (without the exntention '.rar')
[11:33] <achandra> sindrum: you might wanna also check out...contribs.org sme server... not ubuntu but pretty nice.
[11:33] <warlock> aye I know, it sounds confusing :P
[11:34] <boink> libdvdcss2 - portable abstraction library for DVD decryption <- you need that one
[11:34] <mnepton> warlock: ls -R /my/dir > ~/files.txt
[11:34] <achandra> arne: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/hal/+bug/14692
[11:34] <warlock> but how to remove the extentions?
[11:34] <mnepton> warlock: you could then use sed or awk to strip the extensions
[11:34] <c0> hiiii...
[11:34] <BeanBag> xzk: thanks, wil give it a try
[11:34] <warlock> ok
[11:34] <xzk> yep
[11:35] <Blackheart> Hello, is there a way with apt-get or aptitude to download dependencies for a particular package... eg php5-dev depends on libssl-dev but says 'Depends: libssl-dev but is not going to be installed'
[11:35] <warlock> thanks mnepton
[11:35] <qsuc> I'm going to be dual-booting with windows vista, which file system should i use to install ubuntu?
[11:35] <BeanBag> xzk: one last thing, wil it work for the broadcom 4311 as well?
[11:35] <arne> OK but I have the libdvdread3 installed...
[11:35] <boink> and the other one?
[11:36] <xzk> all the broadcom chips suck equally so its definitly worth a shot
[11:36] <BeanBag> xzk: thanks
[11:36] <Raphael> is the nvidia 1.0-9xxx drivers in uni/multiverse?
[11:36] <achandra> xzk: 110% agree with your statement.
[11:36] <arne> I couldn't find it in Synaptic...
[11:37] <xzk> :0
[11:37] <xzk> ah  :)  there.
[11:37] <achandra> bloody bcm anything sucks
[11:37] <achandra> sorry bcm fans..but ive run into more issues...
[11:37] <duckman0> qsuc: do you mean like ex3 file system?
[11:37] <achandra> and yes I have one
[11:37] <qsuc> duckman0 yes indeed
[11:38] <Blackheart> Anyone?
[11:38] <qsuc> which one works best with Vista on another partition on the drive
[11:38] <duckman0> qsuc: just use that one its what everyone is using.
[11:38] <qsuc> if it matters at all - i thought maybe if i have movies on the ubuntu partition, i might want to play them in vista
[11:38] <Blackheart> Is there a way to remove ALL packages installed by apt-get so I can start a fresh (without a format)
[11:38] <xzk> i got a question - i'm moving into a new APT tomorrow. is it bad that i haven't packed anything yet?
=== c0 is now known as Ardan
=== Ardan is now known as c0_
[11:39] <qsuc> ok, thanks duckman0, anyone else know which file system to pick? ext3, FAT32, XFS, etc.?
[11:39] <achandra> qsuc: well there are many schools of thought..but EXT3 should work okay for you. If you want to be slick read up on LVM and use that in conjunction
[11:39] <sod75> Blackheart: not really
[11:39] <sc0tt_> If you're asking that question, use ext3
[11:39] <tuskernini> QUESTION, how do i view HD movies on my ubuntu desktop? all my video players just bomb out after starting
[11:39] <qsuc> ok, cool
=== c0_ is now known as c0_ardan21
[11:40] <warlock> mnepton, is it possible to only get all files ending with .bsp to be printed out in files.txt ?
[11:40] <qsuc> sc0tt_ when I use ext3, can I browse that partition in vista?
[11:40] <duckman0> qsuc: yeah thats basic it because ex3 fs is freely licenced and everyone can use it
[11:40] <achandra> qsuc: using Logical volumes will give you some flexibility later as well.
[11:40] <sc0tt_> qsuc: not natively, you'd have to find drivers for it
[11:40] <sc0tt_> but its doable
[11:40] <qsuc> ok
[11:40] <mnepton> warlock: ls -R /my/dir | grep .bsp > ~/files.txt
[11:40] <qsuc> cool that works
[11:40] <warlock> thanks a bunch, again.
[11:40] <sod75> qsuc: if you want to access it in vista, best is fat32
[11:41] <xzk> warlock -  do you play WoW
[11:41] <warlock> nope
[11:41] <xzk> dang. the name threw me off
[11:41] <warlock> mnepton, it gets the files having .bsp.ztmp in them aswell? :/

[12:20] <media> I will see what happens with freevo now :)
[12:20] <media> trying to build a media pc :)
[12:20] <warlock> achandra, I want it .tared, but I want it splitted - like in 3 .tars and these filed moved to /var/www/
[12:20] <achandra> miika_: a utility that allows you to connect to a WPA protected wireless network. It allows you to pass directives within the wpasupplicant.conf file to connect in different ways (ie based on encryption methods)
[12:21] <achandra> warlock: yeah..ill have to think about that...especially based on "what" criteria we'd want those spilt...ie by date? or ?
[12:21] <warlock> doesn't matter really, just so people don't have to download 1gb .tar file :P
[12:21] <warlock> by name, if you need to choose anything - doesn't really matter though.
[12:22] <achandra> warlock: hmm lemme ponder that...but maybe passing something by date or something would do it?
[12:22] <stenbod> could somebody try to help me getting my wireless network work please?
[12:22] <warlock> sure achandra
[12:22] <achandra> warlock: by name? like for example tar these files with these extensions into one...and then those and such? what is the file extension type.
[12:22] <miika_> achandra: well, what lines i have to add to that conf file to get my network wokring ? following parameters are required: SSID=TAMK, network authentication = wpa, data encryption = tkip, eap type = peap
[12:22] <achandra> warlock: you were giving me an opt out ;P
[12:23] <warlock> well, there's a few extention types actually, just want all files in /my/dir to be .tared down into 3 .tars (ex; maps1.tar.gz, maps2.tar.gz, maps3.tar.gz) then moved to /var/www/
[12:23] <achandra> miika_: I could be dead wrong...but i believe there is a sample file in the docs that come with wpasupplicant..so id start there first..its pretty extensive
[12:24] <achandra> warlock: if you think you have a file type for lets say *.amazon.bsp or whatever and there is abunch of those..sure..
[12:24] <achandra> that would be easy..is there something like that ??
[12:25] <gaminggeek> anyone know when festy comes out>
[12:26] <bimberi> warlock: have a look at the dirsplit command.  Perhaps use it then tar the results.
[12:26] <achandra> bimberi: Id be interested in knowing how that works as well
[12:26] <mnepton> gaminggeek: april
[12:27] <gaminggeek> cool :)
[12:27] <burepe> What is mysqli?
[12:27] <bimberi> achandra: 'man dirsplit' (I've only just started reading about it myself :) )
[12:27] <achandra> bimberi: from a novice perspective i can split the tars by file type..but the dirsplit looks interesting
[12:27] <achandra> lol
[12:27] <achandra> okay
[12:28] <bimberi> !feisty | gaminggeek
[12:28] <ubotu> gaminggeek: The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is pre-alpha.

[12:29] <burepe> What is the difference between mysql and mysqli?
[12:29] <mnepton> burepe: one vowel
[12:29] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[12:30] <burepe> I have a faq and it says if you want mysqli functions change the file name to mysqli
[12:30] <mnepton> mysqli = mysql improved
[12:30] <mnepton> the definition of "improved" in that context is still being disputed
[12:30] <Arcad3> how can i make apache2 accept cgi?
[12:31] <mnepton> Arcad3: install the cgi module and enable it in the apache configs

[12:33] <euskadany> do you think ubuntu live is good for running testdisk and ddrescue? i need to recover some damaged partitions.. thanks :)
[12:33] <warlock> achandra, nah not really, 15minutes or so max. I'll be gone for 1-2h though
[12:33] <warlock> If you can join #tar.bla.chat - and I'll get back to you asap when I'm back

[12:34] <vernes> If I want to prevent X11 from loading a window-manager (no gnome), which file sets the usage of gnome? I'm looking in /etc/rc5.d but no clue.
[12:34] <mnepton> Arcad3: are you trying to run php as a cgi, or just standalones?
[12:35] <Arcad3> standalones
[12:35] <Arcad3> found php5-cgi
[12:35] <Arcad3> i have php5 installed
[12:36] <mnepton> php5-cgi is for running PHP as (f)cgi, not for running standalones
[12:36] <mnepton> you'll want lib*cgi and the apache cgi modules
[12:37] <Arcad3> if i want to install all modules
[12:37] <Arcad3> how the command apt-get will be'

[01:21] <sc4ttrbrain> wait i forgot..in the forum someone build it... or from the site
[01:21] <LordGoth> I could use some help
[01:21] <doskey> i have a .pakage how do i install it for the new amsn ?
[01:21] <doskey> via the terminal ?
[01:21] <Himura> yep
[01:22] <x-r00t-x> or double click on *.deb file :P
[01:22] <doskey> how do you install it ?
[01:22] <doskey> what me ?
[01:22] <cafuego_> sudo dpkg -i <foo>.deb
[01:23] <Himura> doskey, sudo sh the_package.package
[01:23] <x-r00t-x> wtf is make[2] : Nothing to be done for `all-am'.
[01:23] <agreif> what is the easiest way to distribute ubuntu packages? deb files?
[01:23] <LordGoth> is a j2re hard to load on this distro?
[01:24] <x-r00t-x> no LordGoth
[01:25] <LordGoth> ok, so just rpm it like I usually do or is there some special sequence I have to use?
[01:25] <x-r00t-x> you have to convert it to deb
[01:25] <x-r00t-x> using alien
[01:26] <x-r00t-x> !alien
[01:26] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[01:26] <LordGoth> I see.
[01:26] <LordGoth> this is weird. I've never used Debian or anything like it.
[01:26] <LordGoth> it was either Mandrake, or SuSe.
[01:27] <xopher> LordGoth, you'll love it once you get used to it  ;)
[01:27] <LordGoth> is Ubuntu better than its low-end cousin or does it make a difference?
[01:28] <x-r00t-x> ubuntu is the best :D
[01:28] <Haitao> hi guys! trying to configure CUPS on a UBUNTU server without X.. any idea how I can do that?

[01:29] <LordGoth> and since I'm not a Debian user, this is all new to Me.
[01:29] <x-r00t-x> LordGoth,  one of my friend got this prob . i dont know about it

[01:33] <LordGoth> with Debian, I'm lost.

[01:35] <onesandzeros> hmmm... is there a preferred method to make udev re-read its rules?
[01:35] <VigoFusion> Yes, with Terminal,Konquror or Device Manager you can see or look at lotsa stuff! The File Browser also is neato
[01:35] <x-r00t-x> sc4ttrbrain,  what i have to do now ?

[01:36] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: i use kiba-dock, but its more resource hog
[01:36] <LordGoth> sc4ttrbrain: just install konqueror then, and do it like I used to?

[01:37] <sc4ttrbrain> LordGoth: if u use konqueror in suse, big chance u use kde, so i suggest u use kubuntu,instead of ubuntu
[01:38] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: wait
[01:38] <LordGoth> it'd make more sense for Me to learn something new though wouldn't it?

[02:02] <burepe> Do I need quota for a lamp server? What is it used for?
[02:02] <VigoFusion> !Lamp
[02:02] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+).
[02:02] <sc4ttrbrain> abuyazan: wow,that looks nice,but i have another installed
[02:02] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: u need quota if u want to hosting web server, limiting bandwith etc
[02:02] <burepe> k thanks
[02:03] <x-r00t-x> VigoFusion,  does it work on edgy ?
[02:03] <abuyazan> sc4ttrbrain,  ok so what is the problem of dependency did you tried to install it
[02:04] <VigoFusion> Yes, it works on Edgy

[02:19] <tryxter> how can i use the file explorer beeing root
[02:19] <tryxter> ?
[02:20] <doskey> sudo
[02:20] <LadyNikon> tryxter: you can log into x as root
[02:20] <LadyNikon> and use it that way
[02:20] <tryxter> i'm using gnome
[02:20] <tryxter> but how do i apply a sudo to the file explorer?
[02:21] <sc4ttrbrain> tryxter: sudo nautilus
[02:21] <LadyNikon> i just log into the x session as root
[02:21] <tryxter> hum... ok
[02:21] <tryxter> ty
[02:21] <sc4ttrbrain> tryxter: i have nautilus script for that if u want
[02:21] <rance> tryxter: please dont log into an X session as root, its very dangerous
[02:21] <tryxter> yes rance, i know
[02:21] <rance> sudo <program name> is fine
[02:21] <LadyNikon> rance: what makes it dangerous?
[02:22] <tryxter> sc4ttrbrain, can you send it to me please?
[02:22] <sc4ttrbrain> ok
[02:22] <sc4ttrbrain> wait
[02:22] <tryxter> ty :)
[02:22] <rance> LadyNikon: running any process as root is dangerous since root has the authority to really screw things up
[02:22] <tryxter> lol
[02:23] <LadyNikon> oh
[02:23] <sc4ttrbrain> tryxter: http://www.pastebin.us/9386
[02:23] <LadyNikon> i guess i havent done that yet
[02:23] <LadyNikon> heh
[02:23] <rance> but with X its even more risky since X has access to so many parts of the system anyway
[02:23] <LadyNikon> oh well
[02:23] <x-r00t-x> shit i drop soup on my shirt :(
[02:23] <LadyNikon> yeah but if you login as root to do something anyways..
[02:23] <LadyNikon> x-r00t-x: no S words :p
[02:24] <sc4ttrbrain> he is just frustrated one
[02:24] <tryxter> sc4ttrbrain, how do i install it? i'm kind of linux newbie :S
[02:24] <rance> when you sudo <program name> only that program is running as root and then there is a little bit of damage control just from the design of what the program wont do
[02:25] <LadyNikon> ok
[02:25] <sc4ttrbrain> tryxter: put that on your .gnome2/nautilus-scripts
[02:25] <sc4ttrbrain> tryxter:  check this http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/
[02:25] <sc4ttrbrain> tryxter: world just get better :D

[02:26] <tryxter> lol :D
[02:26] <rance> if you need to be root for an exended period of time, try sudo -i in a shell, it will actually give you the shell as root and then you dont have to type "sudo" in front of every command
[02:26] <sc4ttrbrain> or sudo su
[02:26] <x-r00t-x> LadyNikon,  :D s word? so i cant type s ?
[02:26] <x-r00t-x> right
[02:26] <x-r00t-x> zo wahtz  up?
[02:26] <gaminggeek> alecjw, how did you set it up?

[02:33] <AWOSDev> I didn't like the way diff outputted
[02:33] <AWOSDev> I just want to know if they ARE different, not WHAT they're differences are
[02:33] <sc4ttrbrain> AWOSDev: u can xdiff
[02:33] <strabes> time for CLASS
[02:34] <AWOSDev> Is *THAT* possible?
[02:35] <x-r00t-x> stra what class?
[02:36] <alecjw> gaminggeek: so, any ideas?
[02:36] <gaminggeek> 101. #	Option "UseDisplayDevice" "DFP, CRT"

[02:37] <alecjw> gaminggeek: only one monitor works. javaJake explained to me that it stops the other monitor from being detected
[02:37] <jrib> AWOSDev: diff -r
[02:37] <AWOSDev> jrib I KNOW that
[02:37] <alecjw> gaminggeek: and its the crt that works
[02:37] <jrib> AWOSDev: what is your question?
[02:37] <AWOSDev> jrib, I want it to only say whether a file IS different
[02:37] <AWOSDev> not what the differences are

[02:51] <tryxter> :S
[02:51] <nothlit> rsync is definitely really great
[02:51] <jrib> x-r00t-x: find, or locate, or whereis
[02:51] <nothlit> install an rsync server on your server and then run the client on the laptop
[02:51] <x-r00t-x> jrib,  to find whole file system
[02:51] <alecjw> gaminggeek: no - im reading it now
[02:52] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: /etc/apache2
[02:52] <gaminggeek> ok :)
[02:52] <jrib> x-r00t-x: locate will work, or   find / -name foo     for example
[02:52] <x-r00t-x> jrib, find -the command filename
[02:52] <burepe> thanks
[02:52] <jrib> tryxter: create a launcer of type file and give it the path to your directory
[02:53] <sc4ttrbrain> tryxter:  ln -s /folder/target /folder/source
[02:53] <x-r00t-x> root@r00t-suck-on-that:/home/r00t-fck# find / -h foo kxdocker_conf.xml
[02:53] <x-r00t-x> find: invalid predicate `-h'
[02:53] <x-r00t-x> jrib,  nothing is work
[02:54] <jrib> x-r00t-x: what is -h suppose to do?
[02:54] <x-r00t-x> i tried -name too
[02:54] <x-r00t-x>  find [-H]  [-L]  [-P]  [path...]  [expression] 
[02:54] <jrib> x-r00t-x: foo just means the thing you are searching for, so:  find / -name kxdocker_conf.xml    but  locate kxdocker_conf.xml  will be a lot faster
[02:54] <tryxter> ty
[02:54] <x-r00t-x> ya its working thank you jrib
[02:55] <alecjw> gaminggeek: it doesnt seem to say how i set a primary monitor. in windoze, i just had to go to display settings and tick the "set as prijmary display" box
[02:55] <minerale> I currently have two differnet sets of menus, a "debian" menu and a "gnome" menu that contains the debian menu as a subdirectory, this ticks me off a bit, why are they two? where are they stored, respectively? is it possible to merge them ?
[02:55] <gaminggeek> alecjw, try nvidia-settings :)
[02:55] <gaminggeek> hmm wait NM
[02:55] <gaminggeek> thats no good
[02:56] <gaminggeek> ubuntu default still uses an old version
[02:56] <skaos> has anyone experiences with installing hp system tools for hp proliant-servers?
[02:56] <gaminggeek> Because it is often unclear which display device is "first" and which is "second", TwinViewOrientation can be confusing. You can further clarify the TwinViewOrientation with display device names to indicate which display device is positioned relative to which display device. For example:
[02:56] <gaminggeek>     "CRT-0 LeftOf DFP-0"
[02:56] <t325> Hello, with networkmanager, how to save the configuration when using wpa?
[02:57] <cbx33> hey guys any samba experts here today?
[02:57] <alecjw> gaminggeek: i think i have an idea. brb
[02:58] <nothlit> Does find use regex or glob?
[02:58] <gaminggeek> cbx33, I'm no expert but I might be able to help
[02:58] <cbx33> ok,
[02:58] <gaminggeek> alecjw, any luck?
[02:58] <alecjw> gaminggeek: it didnt work :(
[02:58] <cbx33> I've managed to get an ubutnu machine running samba to join a windows ad domain
=== g-net|gilnim is now known as gilnim
[02:58] <jrib> nothlit: uses what you tell it to :)
[02:58] <cbx33> the net join command worked fine
[02:59] <gaminggeek> alecjw, :(
[02:59] <cbx33> wbinfo -u and -g work fine
[02:59] <alecjw> gaminggeek: so you think that a newer version of nvidia-config might work?
[02:59] <cbx33> and even smbclient -L works as long as I put i na valid user name and password
[02:59] <gaminggeek> alecjw, maby I'm not sure
[02:59] <DARKGuy> Mornin' :)
[02:59] <alecjw> or nvidia-manger or whatever it is
[02:59] <cbx33> from a windows machine I can browse the shares available on the server
[02:59] <nothlit> jrib, what about by default
[02:59] <cbx33> but I can't access any share
[02:59] <gaminggeek> ok
[02:59] <cbx33> I just get an incorrect user/pass
[02:59] <alecjw> gaminggeek: does it come with nvidia-glx?
[03:00] <gaminggeek> alecjw, I'm not sure
[03:00] <gaminggeek> cbx33, hmmmm
[03:00] <incorrect> cbx33: i am sorry no you don't only i get that :p

[03:01] <ineedmoney> i've got a problem with my ati x600 can someone help me
[03:01] <cbx33> http://pastebin.ca/266905 gaminggeek
[03:01] <jrib> nothlit: if you use -name it is globs if you use -regex it is regular expression
[03:01] <cbx33> if I try and mount it via the commant line I get this
[03:02] <incorrect> ineedmoney: i have an x600 in my laptop,
[03:02] <incorrect> ineedmoney: whats going funny with yours?
[03:02] <burepe> AWOSDev: so, in  "/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" I add "AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php" or "application/x-httpd-php .php" ?
[03:02] <gaminggeek> cbx33, hmm
[03:02] <gaminggeek> I don't know
[03:02] <t325> anyone knows how to save settings in networkmanager?
[03:02] <nothlit> cbx33, you need to use a system user as a samba user and then use smbpasswd to set a password
[03:02] <arquebus> anyone have a problem with automatix being installed over and over again in the official updates?
[03:02] <gaminggeek> password server = *
[03:02] <ineedmoney> when i watch movie they are very slow in the full scree do you know why?
[03:03] <cbx33> nothlit not with AD authentication
[03:03] <cbx33> pete@debbox:~$ sudo mount -t cifs //172.29.96.15/cover tmpmnt/ -o username=administratormount: block device //172.29.96.15/cover is write-protected, mounting read-onlymount: cannot mount block device //172.29.96.15/cover read-only
[03:03] <nothlit> cbx33, or you need to lower to security from user to share in smb.conf
[03:03] <gaminggeek> I assume * is your pass word
[03:03] <cbx33> no
[03:03] <nothlit> jrib, ahh kk ty
[03:03] <cbx33> gaminggeek, no that's just setting up the password servers to use
[03:04] <gaminggeek> ok
[03:04] <cbx33> and as I say if I do smbclient -L it works fine
[03:04] <ineedmoney> when i watch movies they are very slow in the full scree do you know why?
[03:04] <cbx33> but only if I put in a user/pass that is valid on the domain
[03:04] <VigoFusion> arquebus: This is happening today?
[03:04] <cbx33> so i must be authenticating ok
[03:04] <gaminggeek> ineedmoney, what graphics card?
[03:04] <cbx33> I just can't open a share
[03:04] <nothlit> ineedmoney, you probably need your graphics card driver installed
[03:04] <ineedmoney> ati radeon x600
[03:04] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: so, in  "/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" I add "AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php" or "application/x-httpd-php .php" ?
[03:04] <gaminggeek> and what media player?
[03:04] <ineedmoney> vlc
[03:05] <gaminggeek> try mplayer
[03:05] <ineedmoney> ok i'll try it
[03:05] <AWOSDev> burepe AddHandler
[03:05] <arquebus> VigoFusion- yes its been happening for a couple of weeks now
[03:05] <AWOSDev> burepe INCLUDE AddHandler
[03:05] <gaminggeek> its pretty much the one to turn to when everything goes bad
[03:06] <burepe> AWOSDev: thank you
[03:06] <ineedmoney> my mplayer don't play vidoes
[03:06] <cbx33> gaminggeek any further ideas?
[03:06] <gaminggeek> cbx33, sorry
[03:07] <VigoFusion> arquebus: Is it that EasyUbuntu or Automatix or Atomatix2?
[03:07] <cbx33> ok, no problem
[03:07] <gaminggeek> cbx33, encrypt passwords = yes
[03:07] <gaminggeek> try set that to no
[03:07] <gaminggeek> just a guess
[03:07] <cbx33> ok
[03:07] <gaminggeek> might get it to go IDK
[03:07] <arquebus> VigoFusion- Look for yourself http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=amtxupdatewy8.png
[03:07] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: do u have php5.conf in /etc/apache2/mod-enabled/ ?

[03:10] <gaminggeek> depends what codec the avi uses :)
[03:10] <gaminggeek> avi is just a container
[03:10] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: meaning that it doesnt parse php code
[03:10] <gaminggeek> like for example say you had a bag with an apple in it
[03:11] <ineedmoney> mplayer is gay!
[03:11] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: does that mean that my test went well.

[03:15] <gaminggeek> THERE!
[03:15] <VigoFusion> !Automatix
[03:15] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[03:26] <ineedmoney> he plays wmv but in the full screen they are very slow
[03:27] <yuk> ineedmoney: maybe you could try alternative video output
[03:27] <DARKGuy> craig_: Hm, I'm not really sure as I've not tried that. There's something named fbpanel which can add launchers and you might find a way to use it (I don't) if all else fails, I guess you can try asking in #fluxbox or #fluxbuntu
[03:27] <yuk> ineedmoney: mplayer -vo xxx

[03:59] <happy12> Does any one use Openoffice and got problems with dissapearing task/icons
[03:59] <The_Machine> not sure if this is the appropriate place
[03:59] <Qwerty> Lol am dead, I gave an accidental sudo apt-get remove python and it ate away a few 50s of my apps with it
[03:59] <The_Machine> but any argument for ubuntu (gnome) over kubuntu (kde)?
[03:59] <VigoFusion> OpenOffice works great for me
[04:00] <roovis> Hey folks,  I'm using Xubuntu, and Firefox used to launch Thunar when I clicked the "All files downloaded to" button in the Firefox download manager... now it just does nothing, anyone happen to know how to set it back to launch Thunar .. (I made a new user just to make sure it wasn't my personal configuration that broke it... and it isn't)
[04:01] <happy12> Oke using ubuntu Gnome Openoffice isn't working properly
[04:02] <bulmer> hello, if I have to copy or image a hd bit for bit, can I use the live cd ubuntu and then copy a windows ntfs formatted hard disk to another hard disk?
[04:02] <rance> The_machine:  I use the kubuntu live cd as an evangelism tool, since it "looks" and "acts" more like the windows most people are used to I find people more "apt" look at a switch.  IMO gnome just scares them off.  But the facts are that the qt graphics engine (on which kde is based) is more bloated that the gtk engine (gnomes base)
[04:03] <The_Machine> heh
[04:03] <rance> The_machine: but really boils down to a matter of personal preference
[04:03] <The_Machine> interesting
[04:03] <The_Machine> right, i'm using ubuntu right now w/ gnome
[04:03] <The_Machine> and some where saying kde is a better interface because of how it does _____
[04:03] <The_Machine> which, was relatively minor, actually
[04:03] <The_Machine> but i was just wondering what the arguments for one over the other would be
[04:03] <The_Machine> i agree, kde on boot looks more WIndows-y
[04:04] <The_Machine> (as i just installed it in a vmware session)
[04:04] <The_Machine> actually
[04:04] <The_Machine> rance - if i just installed KDE, i would have Kubuntu basically, right?
[04:04] <The_Machine> (even with my ubuntu [default gnome]  operating system already installed)
[04:04] <The_Machine> ?
[04:04] <IdleOne> kde = pretty ( like windows ) gnome = also pretty but not as bloated and runs alot smoother on older machines
[04:05] <LadyNikon> fluxbox ftw
[04:05] <roovis> I like Gnome because when you go into configuration sections, the changes are made in real time... none of this "apply" business.  But that is just my personal preference.
[04:05] <The_Machine> heh
[04:05] <The_Machine> that is cool
[04:06] <The_Machine> so, if you guys could answser me this:  If i simply install KDE, i'm running Kubuntu?
[04:06] <The_Machine> (install and run as my desktop manager, etc)
[04:06] <RememberPOL> my Sessions Startup Programs aren't starting..any idea why?
[04:06] <roovis> The_Machine: Use the "Mark By Task" in synaptic
[04:06] <kmaynard> The_Machine, sudo apt-get instll kubuntu-desktop
[04:06] <IdleOne> The_Machine,  install kubuntu-desktop and yes you will basically have kubuntu'
[04:06] <roovis> The_Machine: There is a "Kubuntu Desktop" option that will make it all kubuntuified.
[04:07] <The_Machine> okay, i'm just trying to fully understand that the only way to distinguish between Kubuntu and Ubuntu is KDE
[04:07] <RememberPOL> nevermind, i got it
[04:07] <The_Machine> and maybe some KDE packages
[04:07] <The_Machine> hmm
[04:07] <The_Machine> that's cool
[04:07] <kmaynard> if you run kde and gnome, your menus will be fugly
[04:07] <The_Machine> kmaynard: what do you mean?  lol
[04:07] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[04:07] <The_Machine> maybe i'll run it as another user?
[04:07] <IdleOne> kmaynard,  wich is what happened to me and thinking of doing a reinstall
[04:07] <kmaynard> The_Machine,
[04:07] <bulmer> hello, if I have to copy or image a hd bit for bit, can I use the live cd ubuntu and then copy a windows ntfs formatted hard disk to another ntfs hard disk?
[04:07] <scenestar> why the hell is the initrc in ubuntu b0rked
[04:08] <seatouch> !tell me about ati
[04:08] <kmaynard> IdleOne, i did the same thing..a re-install made it better
[04:08] <seatouch> !ati
[04:08] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:08] <scenestar> i tried to install nessus
[04:08] <scenestar> and it just exploded
[04:08] <scenestar> every single application that is invoked by init breaks
[04:08] <rance> sorry, afk
[04:09] <[^Twen^] > how can I choose processes that will start together with the OS (ubuntu) ? Like server-processes, who allways shall run?
[04:09] <IdleOne> kmaynard,  so your telling me it's worth the hassle of redoing ubuntu because I hate the fact that all apps in kde start with a K lol call me crazy but it really bugs me
[04:09] <kmaynard> The_Machine, if you run gnome and kde, your menus will be cluttered with stuff from both environments...it's fugly, andi didnt like it much. just make a choice and go with it. either way it's ubuntu underneath
[04:09] <rance> The_machine: yes ubuntu and kubuntu are from the same core, you can apt-get either one on the other
[04:09] <scenestar> which retard decided that breaking every single linux application on the planet was part of ubuntu's design goal?
[04:09] <The_Machine> okay
[04:09] <The_Machine> hmm
[04:09] <VigoFusion> I installed my X200 series ATI with the fglrx, it works great
[04:09] <The_Machine> i'm so already configured using gnome..
[04:09] <The_Machine> i mean, even w/ beryl
[04:09] <scenestar> The_Machine
[04:09] <scenestar> dont use kubuntu
[04:09] <kmaynard> IdleOne, it was worth it to me. i keep /home in a seperate partition, so reinstalls are cake
[04:09] <scenestar> its broken by defailt
[04:09] <The_Machine> heh
[04:09] <The_Machine> scenestar: howso?  :)
[04:10] <ebiven>  I have a USB scanner that worked in Suse but isn't in Ubuntu.  It's an Acer 3300U.  I installed the firmware file, changed snapscan.conf to point to it, and rebooted the scanner and PC.
[04:10] <kmaynard> The_Machine, try kubuntu in vmware or on a live cd or something before you install it
[04:10] <The_Machine> yeah
[04:10] <nolimitsoya> The_Machine, its unstable as hell, to begin with. on all my machines. :)
[04:10] <The_Machine> i'm using it in vmware
[04:10] <ebiven> sane-find-scanner sees it Ok.
[04:10] <The_Machine> nolimitsoya: :)
[04:10] <scenestar> The_Machine the package maintainers are doing botch jobs so they can buy more crack
[04:10] <IdleOne> !crack'
[04:10] <ubotu> crack: Password guessing program. In component universe, is optional. Version 5.0a-9 (edgy), package size 26 kB, installed size 172 kB
[04:10] <The_Machine> are you saying bad things about crack?!
[04:10] <The_Machine> now i'm mad.
[04:10] <prestosd> hey all!
[04:10] <The_Machine> :P
[04:10] <kmaynard> if you want KDE, look into mepis
[04:11] <scenestar> The_Machine im a tweaker
[04:11] <prestosd> mepis rules!
[04:11] <scenestar> i prefer meth
[04:11] <frandavid100> hi guys
[04:11] <prestosd> frandavid100, yo

[04:11] <RedKrieg|Work> I'm getting error 500
[04:11] <rance> its funny, but I havent had any trouble with kde on a kubuntu edgy install, and even got vmware server running
[04:11] <rance> im very pleased
[04:11] <IdleOne> 500? omg shutdown your machine :)
[04:11] <scenestar> frandavid100 thats a http error code
[04:11] <noobian> hi all
[04:11] <kmaynard> kubuntu ran fine for me, i just didnt like it.
[04:12] <RedKrieg|Work> yeah, thanks IdleOne
[04:12] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[04:12] <prestosd> my problem: when I run myy updating tool (because of needed updates) it says I need to run dpkg --configure -a
[04:12] <prestosd> so i did
[04:12] <phaedrus44> dudes...any idea why my wireless connection drops when i use bit torrent?  i have static ip set up to each network interface
[04:12] <scenestar> it crashed on me like john dale earheart
[04:12] <IdleOne> RedKrieg|Work,  sorry dude couldnt help myself
[04:12] <noobian> a noob question. I get the edgy CD. How can i upgrade from dapper?
[04:12] <prestosd> and that errored
[04:12] <scenestar> noobian
[04:12] <kmaynard> !upgrade | noobian
[04:12] <ubotu> noobian: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:12] <apokryphos> noobian: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[04:12] <scenestar> apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:12] <RedKrieg|Work> IdleOne: I'm just making sure it's not just me
[04:12] <noobian> ubotu, thanks
[04:12] <ubotu> You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[04:12] <scenestar> and make sure you replace all dapper in your /etc/sources.list with edgy
[04:12] <prestosd> so i ran apt-get update
[04:12] <scenestar> oh
[04:12] <RedKrieg|Work> IdleOne: I'm not on my usual network (tdy with work)
[04:13] <prestosd> until it didnt
[04:13] <scenestar> and its going to break your initscripts
[04:13] <scenestar> so its reccomended you use dapper\
[04:13] <prestosd> and now the only thing on my update list is automatix2!!! :(
[04:13] <VigoFusion> apt-get dist update
[04:13] <apokryphos> !automatix
[04:13] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[04:13] <prestosd> i know what automatix is
[04:13] <scenestar> yeah
[04:13] <bulmer>  I have to copy or image a hd bit for bit, can I use the live cd ubuntu and then copy a windows ntfs formatted hard disk to another ntfs hard disk? anyone tried this and did not lose data?
[04:13] <sc4ttrbrain> !WorksForMe
[04:13] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[04:13] <scenestar> automatix is an overrated shellscript written by another crack addict
[04:14] <prestosd> lol
[04:14] <prestosd> guess ill just ditch it
[04:14] <arnonym> bulmer: you can copy the hdd with dd. i did that several times
[04:14] <IdleOne> scenestar,  you have issues with crack huh
[04:14] <scenestar> i swear to god, people write some bash script, invoke zenity , cover it with ugley graphics and package it
[04:14] <scenestar> and they think theyre the savior of the linux world
[04:14] <bulmer> armonym: the destination ..copied good no loss of data right?
[04:15] <bur[n] er> roovis: using nvidia beta drivers?  I have no issues here
[04:15] <rance> could some one give me a hand with some network setup issues on ubuntu server 6.06 LTS
[04:15] <KomiaPoika> running edge for no reason with no skill is pure evil
[04:15] <scenestar> rance what is the problem
[04:15] <The_Machine> meth?  hope you're kidding.  crazy.
[04:15] <arnonym> bulmer: bit by bit. but not that fast
[04:15] <rance> scenestar: check out my post at http://www.pastebin.us/9320
[04:15] <incorrect> can i upgrade from i386 to 64 editions?
[04:15] <scenestar> incorrect
[04:15] <scenestar> no
[04:16] <rance> incorrect, I wouldnt
[04:16] <apokryphos> incorrect: no, you need a fresh install.
[04:16] <The_Machine> lol @ "incorrect"!!!
[04:16] <scenestar> The_Machine i got severe ADD the doctor prescrives its too me
[04:16] <The_Machine> great name

[04:17] <ubotu> scenestar: The Ubuntu Code of Conduct to which we ask all Ubuntu users to adhere can be found at http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct/
[04:17] <DARKGuy> woww, nice
[04:17] <scenestar> nolimitsoya
[04:17] <kmaynard> nolimitsoya, thank you
[04:17] <nolimitsoya> blaa, that would be done at install point
[04:17] <roovis> bur[n] er: yeah, I'm using nVIdia beta drivers... I mean, it wasn't crashing all the time, it worked ... but it crashed from time to time... (using amd/nvidia geforce 5500 + latest beta drivers)
[04:17] <scenestar> if some one comes in "CAN AN E 1 HELP ME ISNTALL LUNIX ON A DEAD BADGER" i tell them to google it first as well
[04:17] <scenestar> ask specific and concise questions
[04:17] <blaa> nolimitsoya: It 's two harddisk
[04:18] <frandavid100> do you guys know how to reset all of gconf's settings for a given program?
[04:18] <arnonym> bulmer: never used anything else
[04:18] <scenestar> rance
[04:18] <DARKGuy> scenestar: that's no way to treat someone new to ubuntu, either. You weren't born ubuntu-taught after all
[04:18] <rance> lol @ "Can you install linux on a dead badger
[04:18] <rance> lol
[04:18] <scenestar> DARKGuy
[04:18] <blaa> nolimitsoya: I want to see one harddisk together
[04:18] <rance> scenestar: yes
[04:18] <scenestar> i grew up in the debian trenches
[04:18] <roovis> I know of Ubuntu before Debian was formed.
[04:18] <DARKGuy> scenestar: some don't, show some respect at least
[04:18] <bulmer> thanks arnonym
[04:18] <scenestar> i was bootstrapping my os from source when you were still using window supdate
[04:18] <nolimitsoya> blaa, and you want to turn lvm tricks on the second one? make an extended partition on the harddisc, and then create a logical partition inside that partition
[04:18] <kmaynard> you sound like a #debian user
[04:19] <scenestar> rance, what are your firewall rules?
[04:19] <apokryphos> Guys, please be nice.
[04:19] <nolimitsoya> blaa, if you want a jbod raid you need an lvm partition on the first drive, to expand from
[04:19] <rance> Scene start, right now I only have three firewall rules
[04:19] <nolimitsoya> blaa, if you want a stripe raid, things will get tricky if youve already got an installed system on one of the drives
[04:19] <scenestar> oh
[04:19] <skaos> has anyone experiences with installing hp system tools for hp proliant-servers?
[04:20] <scenestar> rance, you should edit /etc/interfaces
[04:20] <rance> scenestar: the three rules are the first three rules at https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/firewall-configuration.html
[04:20] <scenestar> and instead of dhcp auto set up the gateway and dns in there
[04:20] <scenestar> or use the errr
[04:20] <rance> ok
[04:20] <scenestar> gnome network tool
[04:20] <rance> no X on the server
[04:21] <scenestar> oh
[04:21] <scenestar> you using ubuntu for a server?
[04:21] <rance> its a test server but yes
[04:21] <kmaynard> ubuntu-server rules
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> scenestar, that would be the entire point of the ubuntu-server distro :)
[04:21] <scenestar> rance i seriously reccomend you ditch ubuntu for headless clients
[04:21] <kmaynard> i've got a server running dapper...great box
[04:22] <scenestar> kmaynard yeah, but after edgy all my shellscripts were b0rked
[04:22] <mordof> can anyone tell me how to run a wine app in bash but make it so that i can close the bash terminal after i've run it.. is it like & at the end or something?
[04:22] <rance> its not headless, the hardware wont permit it, had to hook it up to a kvm switch to get it to boot
[04:22] <kmaynard> i run X on it, and connect with NoMachine...other than that it's headless
[04:22] <DARKGuy> mordof: yes

[04:22] <kmaynard> scenestar, so dont use edgy for a server
[04:22] <blaa> nolimitsoya: sorry can you describe again.
[04:22] <DARKGuy> mordof: without the >'s and <'s
[04:22] <scenestar> blegh
[04:22] <dbzdeath> which package would the man pages for C's functions be in?
[04:22] <scenestar> im leaving
[04:22] <nolimitsoya> blaa, what part? :)
[04:22] <scenestar> my hatred for the human race is returning
[04:23] <kmaynard> enjoy :)
[04:23] <rance> the box isnt edgy, is dapper LTS
[04:23] <mordof> DARKGuy: it still closed the wine app when i closed the terminal

[04:23] <DARKGuy> eh
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> !language | scenestar
[04:23] <ubotu> scenestar: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.

[04:23] <mordof> alright
[04:23] <kmaynard> w00t
[04:23] <mordof> that was quite uncalled for -.- heh

[04:24] <kmaynard> what i mean...stupid tab
[04:24] <mordof> DARKGuy: nope, still takes it with it
[04:24] <blaa> ubotu: it 's not raid
[04:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about it 's not raid - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:24] <DARKGuy> mordof: Hm, try...
[04:24] <blaa> nolimitsoya: trick
[04:24] <kmaynard> rance, what packages you got for the hp?
[04:24] <DARKGuy> mordof: wine app.exe && sleep 5 && exit
[04:24] <nolimitsoya> blaa, ubotu is a bot. dont talk to it ;)
[04:25] <blaa> nolimitsoya: thanks
[04:25] <nolimitsoya> mordof, you could just press alt+f2, if you dont realy need the terminal for something very special
[04:25] <mordof> DARKGuy: it's not closing, heh
[04:26] <mordof> nolimitsoya: won't that mean i have to start another instance of X?
[04:26] <DARKGuy> mordof: d'oh! dunno what to tell you then, I have a script for a wine app here I use, but it's just wine app.exe as a .sh file run like a launcher in iDesk
[04:27] <mordof> can i see it?
[04:27] <nolimitsoya> mordof, come again? pressing alt+f2 giver you the 'run program' applet. just type in there, what you wold the terminal, and press go :)
[04:27] <mordof> the script
[04:27] <mordof> nolimitsoya: ohhh
[04:27] <nolimitsoya> *u
[04:27] <DARKGuy> mordof: cd /home/darkguy/Furcadia && WINEDEBUG="fixme-all" wine Furcadia_f3.exe &
[04:27] <DARKGuy> mordof: as an sh file

[04:27] <jrib> mordof: use nohup, or screen, or disown the job before closing your terminal
[04:28] <Journeyman> w0rd
[04:29] <blaa> how to merge two harddisks to be one harddisk?
[04:29] <rance> ok, now that he's gone
[04:30] <nolimitsoya> blaa, that would be jbod raid, using lvm. hasnt that been explained already? :)
[04:30] <rance> anybody using ubuntu-server 6.06 LTS for a home firewall/router box
[04:31] <coz_> blaa, do you mean have the sustem see 2 hardrives as one?
[04:31] <mordof> DARKGuy: i tried to make a .sh file, and then call it from the panel, but it gives (Permission Denied) when trying to run it
[04:31] <blaa> nolimitsoya: yeah but I don't understand
[04:31] <DARKGuy> mordof: chmod +x script.sh
[04:31] <nolimitsoya> rance, no, but you might want to check out ipcop :)
[04:31] <DARKGuy> mordof: then   ./script.sh
[04:31] <mordof> DARKGuy: oh ok, ty
[04:31] <DARKGuy> mordof: welcome :)
[04:31] <blaa> coz_: yes
[04:31] <nolimitsoya> blaa, as i said, youll need the partition you want to expand to be an lvm partition. is it?
[04:31] <rance> ipcop as flexible as it is, still wont do what I want it to do, so I have to use a full distro
[04:32] <mordof> DARKGuy: now it just says no such file or directory, heh
[04:32] <ezenu> Anyone know of a good intro to encryption guide? maybe utilizing gpg
[04:32] <DARKGuy> mordof: what are you typing?
[04:32] <DARKGuy> mordof: and, is the script located in the directory you already are?
[04:32] <Journeyman> race, what do you want to do?
[04:32] <blaa> nolimitsoya: no
[04:32] <blaa> nolimitsoya: I have new server
[04:32] <mordof> DARKGuy: the script is: /home/user/wine_calls/notepad.sh
[04:33] <nolimitsoya> blaa, so you are partitioning the drives for the first time, no data on them?
[04:33] <mordof> and i called it in the command by adding a . to it
[04:33] <mordof> at the beginning before the /
[04:33] <DARKGuy> mordof: type pwd and tell me what does it says
[04:33] <blaa> nolimitsoya: and have two harddisks.I want the system to see one harddisk
[04:33] <rance> Journeyman, eventually I want a home router/server box that runs cups/samba a firewall, and apache2 for some home based stuff
[04:33] <mordof> DARKGuy: inside the file?
[04:33] <blaa> nolimitsoya: yes
[04:33] <DARKGuy> mordof: nono, in the terminal
[04:33] <rance> it already runs dhcpd and bind8
[04:33] <nolimitsoya> blaa, was that a yes or no?
[04:33] <Journeyman> oh right on
[04:33] <DARKGuy> mordof: just pwd
[04:33] <kmaynard> blaa, you sure you're not looking for RAID 1
[04:33] <nolimitsoya> blaa, good
[04:33] <kmaynard> ?
[04:33] <rance> but I cant get the firewall rules right
[04:33] <rance> or even to work at all
[04:33] <Journeyman> I had my ubuntu box run as a gateway for awhile
[04:33] <mordof> DARKGuy: i put user in there just as a replacement for my user
[04:34] <nolimitsoya> blaa, first, you need to decide if you want raid0, raid1 or jbod. i recommend wikipedia
[04:34] <rance> Im missing something, but have no idea what it is
[04:34] <DARKGuy> mordof: I know ;)
[04:34] <blaa> kmaynard: I don't want back up
[04:34] <Journeyman> rance, iptables is a pain :) which they would port pf to linux
[04:34] <mordof> DARKGuy: it's /home/mordof
[04:34] <Journeyman> wish*
[04:34] <nolimitsoya> blaa, then check out the links ubotu gave you the last time round, or type !lvm to see them again :)
[04:34] <rance> yea, pf is cool
[04:34] <Journeyman> rance, do you have a gui installed? or just cli
[04:34] <kmaynard> blaa, raid isnt necessarily a backup, it's just redundancy
[04:34] <DARKGuy> mordof: try going to the wine_calls folder (cd wine_calls) then doing ./script.sh again
[04:34] <rance> no gui
[04:34] <rance> just ssh to the box from my fully loaded dev machine
[04:35] <Journeyman> webmin has an interface for iptables
[04:35] <DARKGuy> mordof: script.sh is the name of your .sh file anyways
[04:35] <blaa> kmaynard: harddisk just SATA not hot swap
[04:35] <Journeyman> rance, http://www.aboutdebian.com/firewall.htm
[04:35] <rance> I actually want to use "Arno's Firewall script which I have installed but the NAT portion of the rules dont allow traffic
[04:35] <Journeyman> that is a little howto
[04:35] <mordof> DARKGuy: it works when i do that
[04:35] <kmaynard> blaa, i've got 2 80 gb sata drives mirrored with raid 1.
[04:35] <mordof> DARKGuy: but i have to be in the dir to call it
[04:35] <D-Tail> Hello all, can anyone help me with an Ubuntu installation? I've just bought a new Intel DG965RY motherboard and the ubuntu live/install doesn't seem to work. I've searched on the forums and all, but nothing would help me... anyone?
[04:35] <kmaynard> blaa, the system sees them as 1
[04:35] <DARKGuy> mordof: yes, that's neccesary
[04:36] <nolimitsoya> blaa, realize what you are doing, please. read up on wikipedia about diffrent raid tecniques, and then come back for help :)
[04:36] <kmaynard> D-Tail, try the alternate cd...it hangs up less than the live cd
[04:36] <Journeyman> can't really help you there mate, I suck at iptables
[04:36] <DARKGuy> mordof: unless you make a symlink to it in your home folder
[04:36] <rance> so when I started to notice the problem I flushed all the rules and then went to the docs at https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/firewall-configuration.html
[04:36] <DARKGuy> mordof: or move the script to your home folder
[04:36] <mordof> DARKGuy: ah ok, i'll just move it to my home folder
[04:36] <rance> I just ran the first three firewall rules which are supposed to provide nat service, but they dont work either
[04:36] <D-Tail> kmaynard, thanks, will do that instead... I recall ubuntu and a lot of other distros have problems with PATA drivers or something
[04:36] <blaa> nolimitsoya: I 'll try  , thanks
[04:36] <blaa> kmaynard: thanks
[04:36] <D-Tail> the alternate install would solve that?
[04:37] <burepe> Is this two commands or one? As one or as two I can not get them to return. I just get an > "postconf -e 'smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated,permit_mynetworks,reject_unauth_destination'"
[04:37] <mordof> DARKGuy: woohoo! works now :) and it doesn't leave me with terminal windows giving output that i can't close, heh
[04:37] <DARKGuy> mordof: Yay! glad it worked :D
[04:37] <mordof> DARKGuy: tyvm
[04:37] <DARKGuy> mordof: you're welcome :9
[04:37] <DARKGuy> mordof:  :)
[04:37] <kmaynard> D-Tail, the alternate disk has fewer bugs...it's worth trying over the live cd before giving up on ubuntu and/or linux
[04:37] <D-Tail> kmaynard, which distro would you suggest, Ubuntu-6.06-alternate, 6.10-alternate or 7.04 (daily) alternate?
[04:38] <D-Tail> kmaynard, true that, I hate using Windows in the meantime ;-)
[04:38] <mordof> DARKGuy: and now.. to work on my website, heh.. i found that notepad++ works perfect under wine, and i really like it
[04:38] <kmaynard> D-Tail, for a server, dapper. for a desktop, edgy. if you want stuff to break, 7.04 :)
[04:38] <D-Tail> lol
[04:38] <mordof> DARKGuy: cause it's a single user project, so it's only developed for win
[04:38] <D-Tail> OK, I'll try the alternate 6.10 then... Thanks so far!
[04:38] <DARKGuy> mordof: Hey, nice one! I use EditPlus2, but good to know that notepad++ works :)
[04:38] <Trivolt> sc4ttrbrain: I'm still unable to find usplash-dev using Synaptic package manager with all my repo's turned on. what am i doing wrong?
[04:39] <rance> D-Tail, just so you know, the alternate refers to the name of the install media/method, the distros are the version numbers
[04:39] <The_Machine> i accidentally screwed up my splash screen
[04:39] <The_Machine> and i want to revert back to edgy default
[04:39] <The_Machine> little help?
[04:39] <mordof> DARKGuy: tried that one before.. didn't much like it
[04:39] <kmaynard> D-Tail, let us know if it works. i always use the alternate disk. the installer is more text-based, but it works great
[04:39] <rance> back to edgy default, where did you go after that?
[04:40] <D-Tail> rance: so you are suggesting that I would install from other media, rather than CD-ROM?
[04:40] <D-Tail> like USB? I don't own an USB stick that large :-(
[04:40] <kmaynard> D-Tail, no, he's saying the distro is the same....it's just the installer that's different between the CD's
[04:40] <rance> no, sorry you misunderstood me, I mean to say that ubuntu 6.06 is available in from three different install cds
[04:41] <D-Tail> Alright then, I'll proceed to downloading/trying to install then ;-)
[04:41] <D-Tail> thanks again!
[04:41] <kmaynard> np
[04:41] <rance> livecd, install, and then alternate
[04:41] <kmaynard> the livecd suck, IMO
[04:41] <mordof> DARKGuy: i like notepad++ because you can configure everything.. and i like tabs better than buttons, heh.. like you can have a file browsers and all that, but you don't have to if you don't want to
[04:41] <kmaynard> sucks*
[04:42] <burepe> I am doing this command but I am getting an error that I don't have permissions even with sudo any suggestions? echo 'pwcheck_method: saslauthd' >> /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
[04:43] <Trivolt> does anyone know how to get usplash-devel, it doesn't show up in synaptic package manager for me (enabled all repo's)?
[04:44] <kmaynard> burepe, you're running the echo under sudo, but the piped results are being written as the regular user...that's a time when being root somes in handy
[04:45] <nothlit> The_Machine, sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
[04:45] <JasoNWalruS> hello
[04:45] <burepe> if I become root now will it cause conflicts with the echo commands that I did as sudo?
[04:45] <The_Machine> nothlit:  :)
[04:45] <JasoNWalruS> im at school
[04:45] <The_Machine> i didn't know of an update-alternatives
[04:45] <JasoNWalruS> i dl this
[04:46] <nothlit> The_Machine, thats the boot splash screen, you may have to reconfigure initrd ... if you mean the regular splash thats a diff command
[04:46] <JasoNWalruS> i got gaim
[04:46] <The_Machine> right, that's what i menat
[04:46] <The_Machine> the boot splash
[04:46] <burepe> kmaynard:  if I become root now will it cause conflicts with the echo commands that I did as sudo? How do I sign in as root? I have never done that?
[04:46] <The_Machine> perfect.
[04:47] <The_Machine> burepe: do you really have a reason to use your gui as root?
[04:47] <JasoNWalruS> wheres every1 from?
[04:47] <burepe> read up
[04:47] <The_Machine> JasoNWalruS: detroit
[04:47] <JasoNWalruS> awesome
[04:47] <JasoNWalruS> im in texas
[04:47] <JasoNWalruS> its kind fo cold
[04:47] <JasoNWalruS> like 30 degrees
[04:47] <The_Machine> so change the permissions of that command to include root
[04:48] <stoorty> you should try here in scotland :S
[04:48] <The_Machine> hmm
[04:48] <JasoNWalruS> hahahaha
[04:48] <The_Machine> actually
[04:48] <The_Machine> nm
[04:48] <The_Machine> JasoNWalruS: that is cold, man.
[04:48] <JasoNWalruS> how cold?
[04:48] <The_Machine> i mean, for TX..
[04:48] <The_Machine> it's like 20 here
[04:48] <The_Machine> but i'm practically in canada.
[04:48] <JasoNWalruS> the normal in texas now is 20
[04:48] <linuzo> Anyone know how to override brasero cause I am trying to burn a DVD iso to DL disk but it said will not burn because half the space on the disk will be wasted. but I don't care about the space..
[04:49] <burepe> The_Machine: was that permissions comment for me? How do I do that?
[04:49] <XiXaQ> What is CPU time for a process?
[04:49] <JasoNWalruS> all of are horses are dead
[04:49] <nothlit> The_Machine, you probably want to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-generic too
[04:49] <JasoNWalruS> and we dont where cowboy hats
[04:49] <The_Machine> burepe: i don't know what i'm talking enough to help you.  I spoke out of turn.
[04:49] <The_Machine> sorry
[04:49] <coz_> burepe, I am checking for you in another channel hold on
[04:49] <The_Machine> talking about, even
[04:49] <linuzo> haha JasoNWalruS Where calgary?
[04:49] <burepe> coz_: thanks
[04:49] <XiXaQ> JasoNWalruS, please go to #Ubuntu-offtopic
[04:49] <JasoNWalruS> we are skipin the cattle drive
[04:49] <nothlit> The_Machine, to rebuild initrd, or you might have one splash at bootup and another at shutdown
[04:50] <JasoNWalruS> im in 2nd period right now
[04:50] <The_Machine> nothlit: i'll check it out in a min. :)
[04:50] <The_Machine> really?
[04:50] <The_Machine> in school?!
[04:50] <JasoNWalruS> im in buiness computer programin
[04:50] <The_Machine> high school?
[04:50] <The_Machine> ah
[04:50] <The_Machine> okay
[04:50] <JasoNWalruS> yeah
[04:50] <The_Machine> heh
[04:50] <nothlit> burepe, to pipe the results you do echo string | sudo tee file and for append you use sudo tee -a
[04:50] <The_Machine> oh, really?  in high school and you can talk on IRC during class?!
[04:51] <JasoNWalruS> yeah
[04:51] <JasoNWalruS> hacks
[04:51] <JasoNWalruS> man
[04:51] <Raskall> This is crazy. I am on a train running 150 km/h and connected via (E)GPRS/UMTS and NX rocks. NX is incredible
[04:51] <JasoNWalruS> you got to learn fast
[04:51] <burepe> nothlit: sorry I don't understand
[04:51] <The_Machine> JasoNWalruS: that's crazy!
[04:51] <The_Machine> how did you hack it?
[04:51] <JasoNWalruS> to download
[04:51] <The_Machine> just using port 80?
[04:51] <nothlit> burepe, instead of using >> you need to use | sudo tee -a
[04:51] <JasoNWalruS> they have locks
[04:51] <Raskall> I am used to running ssh sessions over this link and it is extremely slow, but NX? It's almost just as sitting on a local console
[04:52] <JasoNWalruS> so i cant dl
[04:52] <The_Machine> like, vnc?
[04:52] <nothlit> burepe, and instead of > you can use sudo -tee
[04:52] <nothlit> sudo tee*
[04:52] <JasoNWalruS> idk what kind of locks they use
[04:52] <JasoNWalruS> lightspeed
[04:52] <nothlit> Raskall, are you using NoMachine FreeNX or 2X's implementation?
[04:53] <The_Machine> JasoNWalruS: are you on a linux box or windows?
[04:53] <JasoNWalruS> windows
[04:53] <burepe> nothlit: so I do "sudo -tee echo 'pwcheck_method: saslauthd' >> /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf" is that what you mean?
[04:53] <The_Machine> oh, using mirc or java client?
[04:53] <JasoNWalruS> idk not mirc i know
[04:53] <JasoNWalruS> its called gaim
[04:53] <The_Machine> oh, i know gaim
[04:53] <JasoNWalruS> yeah
[04:53] <The_Machine> so they have gaim installed on the computers?
[04:54] <JasoNWalruS> no
[04:54] <The_Machine> that's nuts - i mean, no body would pay attention
[04:54] <JasoNWalruS> i installed
[04:54] <nothlit> burepe, no i meant replace the '>>' with '| sudo tee -a'
[04:54] <JasoNWalruS> using admin
[04:54] <The_Machine> i thought you said you couldn't install?
[04:54] <Raskall> nothlit: the one from www.nomachine.com.
[04:54] <The_Machine> heh
[04:54] <JasoNWalruS> i have admin password
[04:54] <JasoNWalruS> IWOJIMA45
[04:54] <dreamer> heuh, xmms just miraculously disappeared ..
[04:54] <JasoNWalruS> thats it
[04:54] <nothlit> burepe, like this echo 'pwcheck_method: saslauthd' | sudo tee -a /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
[04:54] <The_Machine> lol
[04:54] <The_Machine> how did you get it?
[04:54] <JasoNWalruS> friends
[04:55] <The_Machine> hehe
[04:55] <The_Machine> hacked it?
[04:55] <The_Machine> wow
[04:55] <JasoNWalruS> yeah
[04:55] <Dan_n2200> doubt it its probably on a label on the desk
[04:55] <JasoNWalruS> ?
[04:55] <XiXaQ> Raskall, have you tried freenx? If so, how does the NX Free Edition compare to FreeNX?
[04:56] <blaa> nolimitsoya: ubuntu 6.06  support raid?
[04:56] <JasoNWalruS> are drugs cheap where yall are from?
[04:56] <ashov> upgrading to 6.10 seems to have removed some fonts that the ion3 window manager used. how do i find out which and get them back?
[04:56] <nothlit> I hope you're speaking purely medicinal
[04:57] <Raskall> XiXaQ, nothlit: I tired freenx first, but couldnt get nxagent working either in a 32-bit chroot or native. So I had to go for the nomachine free-edition
[04:57] <nothlit> Raskall, you're running 64bit?
[04:57] <burepe> nothlit: Thanks. I have many commands with echo. Can I do the rest of them with sudo?http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06_p5
[04:57] <XiXaQ> Raskall, what do you mean couldn't get it working? Did you use the clients from nomachine?
[04:58] <nothlit> burepe, like i said you can replace '>' '| sudo tee' and '>>' with '| sudo tee -a'
[04:58] <XiXaQ> Raskall, the clients from nomachine aren't compatible with freenx. You have to use the 1.5 clients.

[04:59] <burepe> nothlit: ok. And the commands that I did before you gave me that are ok? I don't need to do them again or anything do I?
[04:59] <ikurus> tried apt'ing a few of those packages
[04:59] <Raskall> nothlit: I am running 64bit natively, yes. But the nx server is running in a chroot jail
[05:00] <linuzo> JasoNWalruS, ahh i c USA man. .
[05:00] <Raskall> XiXaQ: where do I get the 1.5 clients?
[05:00] <JasoNWalruS> yeah
[05:00] <JasoNWalruS> i dislike usa
[05:00] <JasoNWalruS> they think they're the best
[05:00] <nothlit> Raskall, do you find the performance outweighs the difficulties? especially with binaries?

[05:01] <JasoNWalruS> why
[05:01] <burepe> listen JasoNWalruS I am more critical of the us than anyone I know. But being from there I know you're not going to make any friends if you say stuff like that
[05:01] <dreamer> where can I find the log for xmms ?
=== new_cooldaddydoo is now known as cooldaddydoof
[05:01] <XiXaQ> Raskall, I have one for windows. I can send you?
[05:01] <Raskall> nothlit: I had no difficulties with anything after I ditched freenx
[05:01] <nothlit> burepe, i don't know what you ran but if you didn't get any error messages you are probably ok
[05:01] <Raskall> XiXaQ: :) thanx.
[05:01] <JasoNWalruS> yeah
[05:01] <XiXaQ> Raskall, the linux client is available from Seveas packages.
[05:01] <JasoNWalruS> but still
[05:02] <burepe> nothlit: thanks
[05:02] <nothlit> Raskall, does linux32 work for anything you might need?
[05:02] <JasoNWalruS> i want to go to new york
[05:02] <JasoNWalruS> its soo cold
[05:02] <linuzo> XiXaQ, ok then why not tell me how to override this program and force the burn because I don't care that 50% of my disk space will be wasted..
[05:02] <linuzo> JasoNWalruS, I think we have to goto #ubuntu-offtopic to chat .
[05:02] <nothlit> Raskall, so you haven't installed flash or any other closed source binaries or had any troubles with them?
[05:02] <JasoNWalruS> why?
[05:03] <linuzo> cause this isn't a chat channel
[05:03] <JasoNWalruS> what is it?
[05:03] <linuzo> it's a support channel apparantly..   whoever is making the rules these days is messed up. .
[05:03] <tryxter> is there any GUI for lirc or something to make easier the configuration of ir devices?
[05:03] <nothlit> An ubuntu support channel
[05:03] <apokryphos> JasoNWalruS: join us in #ubuntu-offtopic for general chat
[05:03] <nothlit> linuzo, it makes it easier for people to get help that way
[05:03] <dreamer> so does anyone know where I can find the log for xmms, it just shut down with no reason and I'd like to know why
[05:04] <linuzo> nothlit, I understand.
[05:04] <dreamer> apokryphos: why ?
[05:04] <apokryphos> dreamer: because it sucks and there are far superior players on linux
[05:04] <dreamer> apokryphos: name me one :)
[05:04] <apokryphos> ubotu: player
[05:04] <dreamer> I'm willing to try :)
[05:04] <apokryphos> ubotu: players
[05:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about player - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:04] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[05:04] <Raskall> nothlit: I am running firefox with flash in 32bit jail. The flash plugin had to be copied to the firefox plugins directory manually.
[05:04] <nothlit> dreamer, its probably in ~.xmms and if there isn't one you can probably run xmms with some debug options
[05:05] <apokryphos> dreamer: of those I recommend amarok or banshee
[05:05] <ScreaminIke> what does this mean, and how do i fix it?
[05:05] <ScreaminIke> Error: Couldn't set 1024x768 video mode: Couldn't find matching GLX visual!
[05:05] <nothlit> Raskall, ahh
[05:05] <nolimitsoya> blaa, 6.06 supports lvm raid, yes
[05:05] <Aar0n[A] > Hi
[05:05] <dreamer> ok, thnx apokryphos
[05:05] <Raskall> nothlit: it didnt work with apt-get. And I had to download the tarball from adobe and copy the plugin files manually
[05:05] <linuzo> So I was wondering does anyone know how to override the saftely error withthis disk.
[05:05] <nothlit> Raskall, yeah nx is supposed to be usable over dialup with smoothscrolling enabled in browsers

[05:06] <Aar0n[A] > I've just installed Ubuntu server to a box, and selected lamp. I've logged in via SSH but wondered if I actually have Apache installed?
[05:06] <nothlit> Raskall, can the server you're using access :0? or do you have to use a separate x session?
[05:06] <Aar0n[A] > Or do I have to install it now myself
[05:07] <nothlit> Aar0n[A] , you have  to install it yourself if you didn't install the server edition
[05:07] <Aar0n[A] > I did install the server edition
[05:07] <Aar0n[A] > Is there a way to check if I have it installed
[05:07] <nothlit> Aar0n[A] , did you install the server edition with the lamp option?
[05:07] <Aar0n[A] > Yeah
[05:08] <zylche> he forgot bold.
[05:08] <[^Twen^1> lol =P
[05:08] <burepe> nothlit: I did "echo 'mech_list: plain login' | sudo tee -a/etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf" I replaced >> with what you told me to but I got an erro that says  the tee option is wrong. It is Japanese so I can't translate it directly but that is the gist of it.
[05:08] <nothlit> Aar0n[A] , aptitude show apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql mysql-server-5.0
[05:09] <nothlit> burepe, you missed a space in between the -a and /etc/postfix

[05:36] <haxality> heh, I guess a better question is how do I go about removing gnome
[05:36] <terje> yea, they rewrote init
[05:36] <haxality> do I have to go through and remove all of the gnome* packages, or is there one convenient one I can uninstall
[05:36] <vernes> Who has already made their own runlevel with Upstart?
[05:37] <MiniJames> haxality, why do you want to remove gnome?

[05:38] <kmaynard> D-Tail, and?
[05:38] <D-Tail> But the installer complains about not finding a CD-ROM drive

[05:39] <DARKGuy> Hm, I run Diablo II through wine but when I close it it just hangs and I have to kill it all the time with kill and killall using PIDs. Is there a way to get the PID of a process using a bash command and then joining that with kill so it does it automatically?
[05:39] <haxality> DARKGuy: if you do 'killall wine' it should kill it
[05:40] <D-Tail> kmaynard, do you have any clue as to what I should do now?
[05:40] <DARKGuy> haxality: it doesn't, sadly
[05:40] <haxality> DARKGuy: that's very odd.
[05:40] <D-Tail> it asks me for a driver disk, or selecting a module manually
[05:40] <haxality> hmmmmm my bash skills are pretty rusty but let me see
[05:40] <D-Tail> I tried the latter with 'cdrom', but that didn't work
[05:40] <kmaynard> D-Tail, that's odd...is this an old pc or something?
[05:40] <D-Tail> kmaynard, this one is 4 days old ;-)
[05:40] <DARKGuy> haxality: It is :(. So kill -9 and kill are my only ways to kill the wine process. So I need to know how do I get the PID :P

[05:41] <haxality> DARKGuy: ps aux | grep wine
[05:41] <haxality> but there's the problem of piping that to kill -9
[05:41] <kmaynard> D-Tail, brand name or hand built?
[05:41] <D-Tail> hand built
[05:41] <haxality> I know it should be possible but I just don't know my command-line stuff well enough
[05:41] <DARKGuy> haxality: Yes, that's what I need to know :P
[05:41] <y3it221_klce> can anyone suggest me some projects???
[05:41] <DARKGuy> haxality: ps -ax | grep 'wine' does it too
[05:42] <D-Tail> kmaynard, with the normal installer, I get some 'job control turned off' error
[05:42] <D-Tail> which I googled all weekend long
[05:42] <D-Tail> to no solution, of course
[05:42] <haxality> I just can't believe killall isn't working
[05:42] <haxality> that's really odd
[05:42] <DARKGuy> y3it221_klce: projects of?
[05:42] <DARKGuy> haxality: neither do I, but it's alright :)
[05:42] <DARKGuy> haxality: Heh
[05:42] <zch`> i have some weird problem with edgy, on reboot my eth1 dissapears and i have eth2 instead, so i have to run pppoeconf again, then next time it's vice versa and so on and on, any clues?
[05:42] <haxality> because killall does exactly what you're talking about
[05:42] <warlock> Is there a way to see what dir a user is in on my server? (if he uses ssh)
[05:42] <haxality> hmmm
[05:42] <kmaynard> D-Tail, i dunno...all i can suggest is double checking your harware to make sure all your jumpers are set properly...
[05:43] <D-Tail> kmaynard, I did, Windows runs ;-)
[05:43] <vivid> you should return that intel for an athlon x2
[05:43] <haxality> aha, one sec
[05:43] <kmaynard> D-Tail, i know. like i said, that's all i got
[05:43] <haxality> I've almost got it DARKGuy
[05:43] <DARKGuy> haxality: cool! what did you use?
[05:43] <y3it221_klce> DARKGuy: any software project on Linux OS
[05:43] <haxality> one sec
[05:43] <haxality> gonna whip up a one-liner
[05:44] <DARKGuy> y3it221_klce: you could try searching in www.sourceforge.net
[05:44] <haxality> I used 'man ps'
[05:44] <haxality> :P
[05:44] <D-Tail> kmaynard, too bad, but thanks so far. The alternate install seems to have brought me a step further towards the solution ;-)
[05:44] <DARKGuy> lol
[05:44] <y3it221_klce> DARKGuy: i need some LInux OS projects
[05:44] <kmaynard> D-Tail, it's the best. have you tried another distro? i used to learn by seeing what works and copying that
[05:44] <DARKGuy> y3it221_klce: Ah, Linux OSs... oO I had a link with lots of OSs... lemme get it
[05:45] <haxality> ok
[05:45] <haxality> the only problem is
[05:45] <haxality> I know how to pipe output forwards
[05:45] <haxality> but not recursively
[05:45] <x-r00t-x> hey is lamp server good ?
[05:45] <kmaynard> D-Tail, how many cd drives you got? if it's more than 1, try both of them. if you have a dvd drive, you could try a dvd instll disk too...
[05:45] <haxality> DARKGuy: here's what I have so far
[05:45] <D-Tail> kmaynard, I think the 'job control turned off' problem is somehow related to this motherboard, not to a distro...
[05:45] <vivid> www.linux-iso.org
[05:45] <D-Tail> I've seen several questions about it
[05:45] <kmaynard> gotcha
[05:45] <Rprp> Hmm, with wich program can i 'burn' dvd's? like in nero.
[05:45] <haxality> ps -C wine -o pid=
[05:45] <DARKGuy> y3it221_klce: Here's a search: http://www.linux.org/dist/
[05:45] <haxality> that will give you the pid

[05:59] <pettern> do anyone else have problems with opera after the flashplugin got updated?
[05:59] <eltese> I still have 125 fps but there is some kind of lag. Help would be very very welcome :)
[05:59] <wizo> any official guides on how to set up wireless?
[05:59] <Trist_an> eltese, you should run quake 3 in non xgl
[05:59] <haxality> pettern: yes
[05:59] <haxality> pettern: I was actually just about to ask about that
[05:59] <pettern> haxality: found any solution?
[05:59] <neeru> yeah go on the ubuntu main site and look for ndiswrapper
[05:59] <haxality> unfortunately no
[05:59] <haxality> :(
[05:59] <DARKGuy> Now this is just SLEEK: Mono has an Installshield-like installer for Linux
[05:59] <haxality> I've been having all kinds of problems with the flash player plugin, in general
[05:59] <wizo> neeru, is that the only way? using ndiswrapper?
[05:59] <neeru> but i suppose yr best bet was to see if it just works out fo the box
=== |Shadow| is now known as Qshadowp
[06:00] <eltese> Trist_an, mkay. Do you know why I cant use 2 buttons at the same time? And are there no ways of making quake3 run properly when using Beryl?
[06:00] <pettern> guess i can redirecs the swf files to some other app, but thats not really a solution
[06:00] <wizo> neeru, im trying to make it work out of the box
[06:00] <neeru> no thats the way you have to use if your card sint supported out fo the box
[06:00] <haxality> does anyone know if the linux flash player is better than the macromedia one in terms of actually working?
[06:00] <haxality> I don't really care about features, as long as it plays stuff
[06:00] <neeru> okay well go to, system ---> admin --- > networking
[06:00] <Trist_an> eltese, I think no proper way except to launch it under beryl but with in non xgl. For the 2 buttons, I don't know
[06:00] <neeru> and see if its there?
[06:00] <wizo> erm..
[06:00] <wizo> neeru, i dont actually have them
[06:00] <pettern> haxality: i think i used that one before and it sucks
[06:01] <haxality> dang
[06:01] <wizo> i installed the server edition of ubuntu 6.06 and installed flux
[06:01] <eltese> Trist_an, ok. Thanks for your help
[06:01] <neeru> huh what are u using, ubuntu or kubuntu xubuntu
[06:01] <haxality> oh well, gota give it time then
[06:01] <DARKGuy> eltese: Do you have in your xorg.conf the line Emulate2Buttons or something?
[06:01] <Trist_an> eltese, you know how to run it in nonxgl in your XGL-Beryl session?
[06:01] <pettern> haxality: do you know if there is any way to get the        old flash version trough apt?
[06:01] <tryxter> is there any gui to use with lirc? or something easier to configure ir devices?
[06:01] <eltese> DARKGuy, I have a line that says emulate3buttons or something
[06:02] <eltese> Trist_an, nope.. No clue
[06:02] <haxality> pettern: I don't think you can, I think you'd have to find the installer binary somewhere and download it
[06:02] <DARKGuy> eltese: try commenting it by placing a # in the beginning, restart X and try Quake again?
[06:02] <haxality> pettern: I think we're having different problems though
[06:02] <DARKGuy> eltese: if it doesn't works, just remove the #, restart X and try asking here again :/ that's the only clue I have
[06:02] <eltese> DARKGuy, ok. Will try taht :=
[06:02] <eltese> that :)
[06:02] <haxality> pettern: I have trouble in general with the current version of the flash plugin, be it in firefox or opera

[06:03] <aphelion> Hi there
[06:03] <pettern> haxality: what kind of errors do you get if you run it in terminal?
[06:03] <eltese> DARKGuy, I erased that line btw
[06:03] <aphelion> how can i automaticly let firefox open xchat with irc://irc.freenode.org/pulseaudio :) ?
[06:03] <wizo> wish me luck =p
[06:03] <neeru> wait, go to system, then admin then networking, and see if your wireless device is there
[06:03] <DARKGuy> eltese: x_X the idea was to comment it in case you'd need to get it back again
[06:03] <eltese> Trist_an,  mkay.. And Beryl works nice on the other points?
[06:04] <tryxter> is there any gui to use with lirc? or something easier to configure ir devices?
[06:04] <Trist_an> yes, as soon as you quit Quake, you have normal Beryl
[06:04] <eltese> DARKGuy,  hehe okey.. I erased before and tried to see if it would work
[06:04] <eltese> Trist_an,  thanks. What would the full command be? :p
[06:04] <DARKGuy> eltese: and it didn't xD?
[06:04] <neeru> hey all can any1 help me, ive got aigxl working with beryl on my ubuntu box except now i cant select the widescreen resolutons for my screen ive tried editing my xorg but no avail can anyone help

[06:04] <DARKGuy> eltese: Oh well, good luck making it work
[06:04] <Trist_an> eltese, what is the command to launch Quake?
[06:05] <Caspar> who can help me with my nvidia drivers?
[06:05] <DARKGuy> Man, I keep forgetting it >.< what was the command to mount an iso? mount -t iso9660 and what else?
[06:05] <eltese> DARKGuy,  :) Well.. I hope there is someway around it
[06:06] <DARKGuy> eltese: there must be :)
[06:06] <eltese> Trist_an, quake3
[06:07] <Trist_an> then the full command would be DISPLAY:=0 quake3
[06:07] <wizo> ok, so it didnt did work =/
[06:07] <haxality> ok, I have another question.
[06:07] <wizo> how to check if the drivers are being loaded correctly?
[06:08] <metricben> hi

[06:34] <VigoFusion> http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/wiki/
[06:34] <loki505> and will this edgy upgrade deleate all my crap
[06:34] <loki505> stuff
[06:34] <Feral_Kid> Well, here goes nothing as I get ready to install Edgy AMD64...
[06:34] <OtisTick> hi all ... I tried to do a dist-upgrade to dapper but when I got prompte to overwrite some script files, I opted to keep the originals .... which looks like a bad idea now
[06:35] <OtisTick> any idea how I could now identify what those scripts could have been ?
[06:35] <Feral_Kid> Hopefully, I can get the ATI crap working correctly this time around...
[06:35] <loki505> and last time i upgraded to edgy i coulnt get it to boot up completely to my desktop and i had to reload 6.06
[06:35] <OtisTick> basically, I think they were being changed from bash to sh or the other way round
[06:35] <VigoFusion> Feral_Kid: I used the fglrx to fix mine.
[06:35] <LjL> loki505: perhaps you had unofficial repositories enabled or something. anyway, if the process goes as it should, you aren't supposed to lose anything
[06:36] <loki505> nots only that i heard from alot of people to hold off till april
[06:36] <Imrahil> OtisTick, are you referring to files in /etc that were being changed after dist-upgrade?
[06:36] <loki505> oh ok
[06:36] <Feral_Kid> VigoFusion> On the 64-bit version on Edgy?
[06:36] <cj0nes> anyone have a problem when closing the lid of the laptop the screen goes blank and won't come back on, have to end up restarting?
[06:36] <loki505>  what about all the bad stuff i heard bout edgy
[06:36] <ompaul> loki505, if you customise dapper then using a disk and a fresh install is the best way - upgrades are version to version not including external cludged software
[06:37] <LjL> loki505: those people are probably talking about doing a *fresh* Feisty install in April. i don't see how these people can look into the future and say that Feisty will be more stable than Edgy or whatever, anyway ;-)
[06:37] <OtisTick> Imrahil: hm, not entirely sure but that sounds about right
[06:37] <VigoFusion> Feral_Kid:6.10 Edgy
=== nokompranos is now known as noko
[06:37] <OtisTick> althlugh I'm pretty sure that it was *during* dist-upgrade
[06:37] <raja> is it possible to upgrade from debian stable to ubuntu edgy
[06:37] <stefg> OtisTick: a rude way to solve your problem would be 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a'... reconfigure all installed packages...
[06:37] <Feral_Kid> VigoFusion> I will check into that as soon as I install...
[06:38] <OtisTick> stefg: you know, that sounds just right
[06:38] <OtisTick> stefg: I'll try that :-) thanks !
[06:38] <VigoFusion> Feral_Kid: I did NOT install the Binary Drivers from ATI, I used the fglrx and they loaded fine.
=== stelt_ is now known as stelt
[06:38] <loki505> like  i got my downloads folder  with all my music and videos in stuff and i dont want all that gone its in my home folder and inside of loki505
[06:38] <OtisTick> stefg: and it can't damage my system any more than it is : I'm one step from wiping it and doing a full install from an ISO
[06:39] <loki505> loki505 is what i named  the folder inside of home
[06:39] <stefg> OtisTick: so give it a go... just for the experience
[06:40] <Ludwig_II> hello together
[06:40] <loki505> im doing this right know is it good If you want to upgrade from 6.06 LTS to 6.10, run the following command (either via ALT-F2 or a terminal):
[06:40] <loki505> gksu "update-manager -c"
[06:40] <loki505> The -c switch instructs Update Manager to look for upgrades. By default, the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS release will not offer that automatically because of its long support cycle and high stability.
[06:40] <loki505> If you have a working network connection, it should then inform you about a new release and offer to upgrade your system.
[06:40] <loki505> If you have the Edgy Alternate Install CD (not the Desktop CD), you can save bandwidth by using:
[06:40] <loki505> gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
[06:40] <loki505> Upgrading using apt-get -- NOT RECOMMENDED
[06:41] <Feral_Kid> VigoFusion> I wonder if that will work correctly with the AMD64 version of Edgy....
=== Mindless_ is now known as caspar
[06:42] <loki505> hello can anybody help ME
[06:42] <DARKGuy> !anyone | loki505
[06:42] <ubotu> loki505: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[06:42] <raja> is it possible to upgrade from debian stable to ubuntu edgy
[06:43] <apokryphos> no
[06:43] <loki505> i am really hesitaing to upgrade to edgy because i am not convinced that i will not lose all my stuff i am a complete NOOb
[06:43] <naitram> I'm trying to do a netboot of some ppc machines.  Running into a problem where all the initrd's that i find with NFS support are bigger than 4 megs (including the official ones for 6.06 and 6.10) and i can't locate a copy of yaboot capable of working  with files over 4 megs.
[06:44] <loki505> DARKGuy can u help me and convince me y i shold upgrade
[06:44] <stefg> loki505: there's backups... (when did you do your last one?)
[06:44] <loki505> without losing all my stuff
[06:44] <Feral_Kid> loki505> Did you do a backup of you stuff?
[06:44] <Ludwig_II> My computer does not show me the the WLAN of my notebook. Even "lspci" and "iwconfig" don't show nothing. Has anyone an idea how to make ubuntu 6.10. recognize my WLAN? (the little control-light of the WLAN is on)
[06:44] <loki505> back ups how do u back like burn cds or what
[06:45] <naitram> loki505: is there a reason you should upgrade? is anything broken? missing any killer features that you honestly _need?
[06:45] <stefg> !wifi
[06:45] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:45] <Feral_Kid> loki505> I just tar'd all of my stuff to my USB harddrive and so I am good to go...
[06:45] <loki505> then imma gonna need a hd huh
[06:45] <loki505> exteranl
[06:46] <Feral_Kid> loki505> Take a look at http://www.mondorescue.org
[06:46] <loki505> ok thanx
[06:46] <DARKGuy> loki505: I have no idea, but if you want to upgrade just backup all your important data and install a new 6.10... I used 6.06 and didn't had any problems, neither with 6.10 (fresh install) I dunno about upgrading though
[06:46] <Ludwig_II> ubotu: thank you
[06:46] <ubotu> You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[06:46] <DARKGuy> lol, cool ubotu
[06:47] <Feral_Kid> I find life is a hell of a lot easier if you do a backup and then do I full new install... But that is just me...
[06:48] <Feral_Kid> VigoFusion> Is there a link about using the fglrx drivers?
[06:48] <zspada15> i can't see the gaim or xchat system tray icons becuase i accidently rightclick, deleted them this morning, how do i get them back?

[06:53] <Huibert> loki505: what happened
[06:53] <loki505> its still upgrading
[06:53] <apokryphos> ubotu: zip
[06:53] <ubotu> Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde) - also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[06:53] <loki505> im just wanderin if there is somthing i should know
[06:53] <Huibert> loki505: as long as the upgrades completes ok, you should be ok :-)
[06:54] <jerp> the reboot is the normal/standard operation
[06:54] <loki505> ok i wont lose my music right
[06:54] <mrmuddle> hiya, just trying my first install of 6.06 LTS... could anyone hazard a quick guess how long it should be waiting on "Mounting root filesystem... ..."?
[06:54] <loki505> its in /home/loki505/Downloads
[06:55] <Huibert> mrmuddle: about 10 to 60 secunds (from the cd?)
[06:55] <jerp> mrmuddle 5-10 mins
[06:56] <mrmuddle> yes, sorry, from the CD. :/ hmm... been about 5mins... I'll give it a good 15 to be safe and then think I've got a problem. ta :)
[06:56] <Huibert> mrmuddle: if you have to try again, try booting without the plash and quiet options
[06:56] <mbuf> any emacs planner users?
[06:58] <mrmuddle> Huibert: thanks, I don't have quiet, as had to remove that and acpi=off to get it running to this point. will remove the splash screen next time also.
[06:59] <Huibert> mrmuddle: wouthout the splash, you have the kernel info scrolling by whlie booting

[07:04] <wizo> im sure there is a wireless, cause there is one wireless router in my face
[07:04] <wizo> :(
[07:07] <cld2> on 6.06 how come when I add something to /etc/rc3.d/S99blah and make it chmod +x it still wont start on a reboot? any ideas?
[07:08] <CuriosCat> Does Ubuntu have some high-res default x.org settings? It works fine on modern machines, but I keep getting a black screen on a fairly large number of older systems with less capable video cards and/or monitors
[07:08] <Huibert> cld2: you should not add sothing   in the directory, but put a link to /etc/init.d/SCRIPT_NAME
[07:08] <CuriosCat> (Tried 6.06 and 6.10)
[07:08] <DARKGuy> CuriosCat: Have you tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:08] <moreta> hola
[07:08] <cld2> Huibert: it shouldnt make a difference I thought.
[07:09] <RobNyc> !fstab
[07:09] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file lists all drives and partitions that are mounted on the system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions
[07:09] <Huibert> cld2: afaik the initprocess scans the dir lookinf for S??name files, and tries to execute them in /etc/init.d, but I could be mistaking
[07:10] <cld2> Huibert: it scans looking for S files and executes them, the location of the file should not matter.
[07:10] <vano> please excuse this ubuntu newbie question: is there possibility to install testing/unstable debian packages in ubuntu? and does ubuntu have a testing/unstable branch? Thanks!
[07:11] <cld2> Huibert: but I could be wrong. thats how it works on solaris and gentoo.
[07:11] <Tominator> does somebody know which driver is best for my Ti4400 whcih works with beryl?
[07:11] <Huibert> cld2: ok.

[07:13] <y3it221_klce> DARDGuy: can u please give me some other projects
[07:13] <CuriosCat> but obviously, this makes it a bit harder to just hand a CD to less computer-savvy friends.
[07:13] <vano> can someone tell me where I can browse/search for latest packages for ubuntu on the net?
[07:14] <vano> ok thanks
[07:14] <boink> packages.ubuntu.com
[07:14] <DARKGuy> y3it221_klce: I know no more, try a search in google with "linux distros"
[07:14] <cld2> Huibert: you have to use update-rc.d  - ubotu told me.
[07:14] <boink> don't you have to, but update-rc.d is a handy tool
[07:14] <boink> you could make the softlinks yourself :)

[07:15] <balsam> Anyone who can help me with a problem in ubuntu 6.10? After a while the whole computer freeze and I have to reboot :(
[07:15] <vano> so is it possible to install a debian package in ubuntu? thanks!
[07:15] <Pelo> balsam,   keep the system monitor in view and see what eats up your memory and cpu
[07:15] <macsim> vano: yes but it's dirty
[07:16] <cld2> Huibert: the royal "you" ;)
[07:16] <Pelo> vana  http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[07:16] <Huibert> vano: it should be possible, but it is better to use the ubuntu repositories.
[07:16] <balsam> I checked syslog and before every reboot i get ACPI Error (psargs-0355): [\_TZ_.THRM]  Namespace lookup failure, AE_NOT_FOUND
[07:16] <wizo> hey, why do i get Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0 when i type sudo ifup wlan0?
[07:16] <vano> ok.. well I need the latest version of subversion... and it is not available for ubuntu (1.3.2 .. when the latest version is 1.4.2)
[07:16] <vano> and I really do not know what to do ...

[07:18] <Trivolt> hello, does anyone know where in 6.10 the runlevels are defined? I want to use my own runlevel, but cant seem to find /etc/inittab, which I used in 6.06
[07:18] <wizo> hey, why do i get Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0 when i type sudo ifup wlan0? im following isntructions from the ubuntu site
[07:18] <balsam> Pelo, ok I will do that
[07:18] <Huibert> !runlevel > me
[07:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about runlevel - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:19] <Huibert> Trivolt: afaik the default is runlevel 2 (X and networking)
[07:19] <wizo> anyone?
[07:20] <Trivolt> Huibert: I know, but i want to use my own, like 9. this is because I want to use my own rc script
[07:20] <Huibert> Trivolt: I think a runlevel is supposed to be < 6
[07:20] <swanberg> Default ubuntu install - I was fiddling with the screensavers and chose Molecule. My hardware can't handle it. How do I get it off that setting?
[07:21] <swanberg> Everytime I start the screensaver demo program, it tries to launch molecule again.
[07:21] <fuffal0> whats the command to see my memory/mem usage in ubuntu
[07:21] <wizo> try top
[07:21] <Trivolt> Huibert: well, I just used 9 in ubuntu 6.06 using /etc/inittab, but they changed it someone in 6.10
[07:21] <vano> hmmm backports is also version 1.3.2 ... can someone please check whether the latest ubuntu subversion is 1.3.2? in case I am doing anything wrong.. thanks a lot!
[07:22] <Huibert> vano: the subversion project latest release is at 1.4
[07:22] <phaedra> swanberg,  system | preferences | screensaver
[07:22] <vano> hmm
[07:22] <swanberg> phaedra: right. If I launch that, it hangs, because it defaults to Molecule.
[07:23] <Huibert> vano: but 1.4 is not completly interchangeable with the 1.0 til 1.3 releases
[07:23] <swanberg> and I have to cold-reboot
[07:23] <vano> Huibert: I know.. that is precisely why I need 1.4 ... I have a 1.4 repository
[07:23] <Huibert> vano: if you have an 1.4 server, you can connect to it with 1.3 clients
[07:24] <vano> Huibert: what I dont understand is why I cannot get 1.4 ... I have back-ports in sources.list ... and updated etc..
[07:24] <Huibert> vano: the 1.4-only features are not available then ofcourse
[07:24] <Huibert> vano: 1.4 is _not_ in ubuntu, anywhere
[07:25] <talat> hi i want to try connect windows with remote asstiantant but idont do it
[07:25] <talat> can you help me ?
[07:25] <vano> Huibert: Well I have problems using svnadmin, svnlook on breezy (1.3) with the 1.4 repository.. error: "svnlook: Expected FS format '1'; found format '2'" etc..
[07:25] <enyc> ?to connect windows?
[07:25] <enyc> what do you mean?
[07:26] <talat> connect to windows
[07:26] <Huibert> vano: where did you get an 1.4 repos, if you don't have 1.4 svn installed ?
[07:26] <vano> Huibert ok that explains .. I was desparate checking my configs as to why I cannot see any 1.4 subversion...
[07:26] <phaedra> swanberg,  Hmmm.   Didn't know the system would hang with that...  You'll have to set the screensaver manually.  Can't remember exactly how at the moment.
[07:26] <vano> Huibert: it is made in windows using TortoiseSVN (1.4.2)
[07:26] <wizo> what does it mean why i get Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0 ?
[07:26] <talat> from kubuntu connect to windows xp
[07:26] <Huibert> vano: then use the windows machine as svn server
[07:27] <Huibert> vano: you can then connect to it wiith 1.3 clients
[07:27] <vano> Huibert: well the whole point is that it has to run under linux.. we dont rely on windows as server around here :)
=== kr0n1x is now known as kr0n1x|away
[07:27] <swanberg> phaedra: yeah, I thought so. Do you know which screensaver program it is? Is it xscreensaver?
[07:28] <Huibert> vano: if you dont reley in wondows, dont create repos with it (sorry had to be said ) :-)
[07:28] <Huibert> oops, thats "on windows"
[07:28] <vano> Huibert: well the problem is that it is not us who creates the repos :)
[07:28] <Huibert> vano: this sounds like a wierd setup, would you like to elaborate
[07:29] <Pelo> wizo,  don' t worry , no one here knows about yoru problem right now,  I myself am getting ignored in another channel at the moment ,  try looking up your error message in the forum, that might help
[07:29] <wizo> im trying :(
[07:29] <wizo> if i cant get this fixed, that means i wont be buying a wireless card
[07:29] <phaedra> swanberg,  Yes.  You can also use xset to shut the screensaver down so you won't have to coldstart...
[07:29] <Huibert> vano: if you don't create the repos, why are you admining it?
[07:30] <swanberg> phaedra: great, thanks!
[07:30] <vano> Huibert because we have to use the repo created on other systems...
[07:30] <cld2> anyone know why a script in /etc/init.d/foo that was added via update-rc.d and works from the command line would not run at startup?
[07:30] <vano> Huibert anyhow the problem is that 1.4 is out but not updated in ubuntu... I'll see how I can install it...
[07:30] <Pelo> wizo,   if you do not have a wireless card right now and are trying to setup a wireless card,  that might be the reason for the problem

[07:43] <balsam> Huibert, no... how do you do that then?
[07:43] <sain> ArrenLex, can i do that in synaptic too?
[07:43] <DARKGuy> Huibert: yeah, it is - but you see, not only I have this non-UTF-8-thing here, it happens with other programs using Eterm so that 's why I was asking, too.
[07:43] <Commander-Crowe> during startup
[07:43] <rambo3> cld2 you need to make /etc/init.d/file executable , sett +x
[07:44] <cld2> rambo3: yup, it is.
[07:44] <Ingmar^> When I run VMWare in fullscreen, my xserver restarts, does anyone know how I can fix this ?
[07:44] <sain> ArrenLex, anything not GUI scares me silly :(
[07:44] <rambo3> cld2 well you srcipt doesnt work then
[07:44] <DARKGuy> Huibert: Like, nano has graphical issues with it so I have to use joe, and such.
[07:44] <Huibert> DARKGuy: it's ok, I just thought I would mention it, because other visitors get reirectly quickly
[07:44] <LjL> DARKGuy: dunno, google isn't encouraging

[07:45] <DARKGuy> Huibert: ah, it's okay then, sorry though ^^;
[07:45] <DARKGuy> LjL: Nope, I already tried, also I set LC_ALL and same thing happens, must be a bug oO
[07:45] <LjL> Huibert: they're redirected because they're *asking for help in other languages than English*, not because they're having problems with UTF-8 on Ubuntu
[07:45] <Huibert> DARKGuy: ok, btw, what do the ^^ mean (I'm pretty new too irc)
[07:45] <rambo3> cld2 check permission for init file and see that you outupt something in file , if it doesnt work its not ubuntu error its your error

[07:48] <sain> ah, but to announce an ignore is very homosensual

[07:49] <DARKGuy> Like, this is a help channel, not a gender fight channel :)
[07:49] <Commander-Crowe> hi
[07:49] <sain> anyway, most people know that because of the way the 2.6 kernel implements the TCP/IP stack that ubuntu is slower on 9/10 special downloading web tests
[07:49] <rapha> DARKGuy: then pls help me!
[07:49] <kmaynard> rapha, delete the .gnome and .gnome2 directories, then try
[07:49] <DARKGuy> rapha: just ask your question -.-
[07:50] <CarlFK> sudo apt-get install linux-image-686 && grep 686 /boot/grub/menu.lst - all I get is ##      kopt_2_6_8_2_686=root=/dev/hdc2 ro - should I see a real grub entry?
[07:50] <rapha> DARKGuy: nm kmaynard already answered :] 
[07:50] <kmaynard> rapha, rm -rf ~/.gnome && rm -rf ~/.gnome2
[07:50] <DARKGuy> sain: if you know that much, why don't you suggest that to Linus then -.-'
[07:50] <LjL> sain: to announce an ignore is very... what? not something i want to hear again, i think.
[07:50] <Commander-Crowe> is it common to post a question and not get an answer?
[07:50] <rapha> kmaynard: I moved them to /tmp but now I miss my mounted servers :(
[07:50] <bXi> yo
[07:51] <ArrenLex> CarlFK: Go look at the file... that line is not part of the bootlist. It's hard to understand what's going on with grep.
[07:51] <bXi> something went terribly wrong here with kubuntu
[07:51] <DARKGuy> sain: we're happy with our Ubuntu, if you aren't, then it might be a good idea to stay with your privative software :), end of conversation for me.
[07:51] <rapha> kmaynard: Can't I just delete that part of them that makes the problems? The problem is just, I can't find that part :(
[07:51] <LjL> !uuid | Commander-Crowe
[07:51] <ubotu> Commander-Crowe: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[07:51] <Nutubuntu> I want to convert a .sit file. Have installed mactools but I can't find a way to start "unsit". I feel stupid asking something so simple, but I'm willing to feel stupid for a moment or two if it fixes the problem :)
[07:51] <LjL> Commander-Crowe: check that the real UUID matches what's in your /etc/fstab
[07:51] <sain> DARKGuy, linus hates anything to do with the net ... you remember the flame war on kernels way back when ...
[07:51] <kmaynard> rapha, this wont hurt anything...it's just those 2 directories. ive done thins before
[07:51] <kmaynard> this
[07:51] <bXi> has anyone here succesfully upgraded kubuntu64bit to edgy ?
[07:51] <DARKGuy> sain: And this isn't a good place to start a new one.
[07:51] <rapha> sain: Linus is a wierd person from time to time and should not be taken too seriously then
[07:51] <LjL> !offtopic | sain, DARKGuy
[07:51] <ubotu> sain, DARKGuy: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[07:51] <CarlFK> ArrenLex: I looked at the file and didn't see a 686 entry - what else should I be looking for?
[07:52] <ArrenLex> Nutubuntu: If your question is "what files did the package mactools contain" the answer is run "dpkg -L mactools"
[07:52] <jrib> kmaynard: he will lose a lot of settings, may be ebst to just rename them
[07:52] <rapha> kmaynard: yes me too. But my network servers are gone after that. You know, the ones I connected to with "Places > Connect to server"
[07:52] <Nutubuntu> ArrenLex - thanks
[07:52] <kmaynard> jrib, i've never lost that much if anything
[07:52] <ArrenLex> Nutubuntu: If your question is "how do I unarchive sit files" my answer is "I have no idea but it probably involves a pagan ritual and virgin sacrifice"
[07:52] <kmaynard> oh
[07:52] <orospakr> Hi!  How do I get Canadian Aboriginal syllabics support installed? All I see is Unicode hex code boxes if I look under "Canadian Aboriginal" in Character Map.
[07:52] <sain> how do i get my repository added to the offical, default ones?
[07:52] <sain> who do i apply to?
[07:52] <rapha> orospakr: there are aboriginals in _canada_?
[07:53] <orospakr> rapha, um, yes...
[07:53] <ArrenLex> rapha: yes? o_O
[07:53] <IdleOne> Nutubuntu, you should be able to right click and extract
[07:53] <rapha> sain: mark@shuttleworth.net?!
[07:53] <Nutubuntu> ArrenLex - thanks - the package contains a utility called "unsit" that seems ideal; however, when I type "unsit" at a terminal, bash tells me it doesn't exist ...
[07:53] <jrib> sain: a better approach is to work on packages for inclusion into the official ones.  See !motu
[07:53] <kmaynard> rapha, then rename them or something...but your problem is likely in those dir's
[07:53] <rapha> orospakr: wow... I always thought they were in Australia only
[07:53] <ArrenLex> Nutubuntu: what's the path?
[07:53] <newbuntu> I cant figure out whether im feelin dapper or edgy   <-- linux joke
[07:53] <sain> rapha, i've been trying to get a hold of him for a while now ... i have a project that $2 mill could really help
[07:53] <orospakr> rapha, not "aborigines", you goofball :P
[07:53] <rapha> kmaynard: yes but I was hoping somewhere in here might know where exactly or how to find out
[07:53] <evgen> hi all
[07:53] <orospakr> that's a different race.
[07:54] <Nutubuntu> IdleOne - fileroller tells me that the archive type ".sit" is not supported
[07:54] <LjL> orospakr: you should find a Unicode fonts that has them, i guess. otherwise, perhaps try typing "apt-cache show texlive-latex-extra | grep Aborig"
[07:54] <LjL> Ubotu, tell orospakr about fonts | orospakr, see the private message from Ubotu
[07:54] <rapha> sain: from my experience, it usually takes a couple of days but he always writes back if it doesn't look like SPAM
[07:54] <LjL> !info texlive-latex-extra | orospakr

[07:54] <bXi> why do i have the feeling that everybody is ignoring me
[07:54] <Nutubuntu> ArrenLex - I'm sorry, I don't understand. What's the path to what?
[07:54] <rapha> orospakr: oh, so "aboriginal" really only is a word for "native"?
[07:54] <sain> rapha, sadly, everything i do and say looks like SPAM :(
[07:54] <IdleOne> bXi,  whats the question
[07:54] <jrib> rapha: are you familiar with a binary search?  rename the folder, see if it works.  Then only rename half of the stuff inside, see if it works, etc
[07:54] <ArrenLex> Nutubuntu: when you run "dpkg -L mactools | grep unsit" what's the full path of the file it lists?
[07:54] <newbuntu> has anyone here used direct connect program for p2p ? i cant get it running
[07:54] <rapha> sain: then you might have a problem of being a "troll" as I've seen them called
[07:54] <sain> aboriginal == original peoples
[07:54] <tonyyarusso> orospakr: Hold on, I might have one for you.
[07:54] <bXi> IdleOne: has anyone here succesfully upgraded kubuntu64bit to edgy ?
[07:55] <kmaynard> bXi, probably no one having the same problem
[07:55] <sain> Aborginal == australian indigenous people
[07:55] <orospakr> rapha, yup.
[07:55] <newbuntu> ubuntu is a tribal word
[07:55] <rapha> jrib: wow... divide and conquer, eh? ... well, will do that then.
[07:55] <IdleOne> bXi,  prolly not in here try asking in #kubuntu
[07:55] <rapha> orospakr: kay :)
[07:55] <bXi> kmaynard: might be so but a dunno should be enough
[07:55] <newbuntu> im in canada an the native people are also the aboriginal people
[07:55] <sain> rapha, no, i'm a literal troll, not a "troll"
[07:56] <tonyyarusso> orospakr: Yeah, syls.  Comes in sylsest.ttf, sylsroe.ttf, sylsrow.ttf, and sylswst.ttf
[07:56] <NET||abuse> hmm, i got a wd 160GB drive today from work, it worked fin on the xp machine,, just put it into this machine(Edgy) and it's not picking up.
[07:56] <newbuntu> i think direct connect is part of emule
[07:56] <sain> well, i support aboriginal languages and such, but surely their first language is English
[07:56] <LjL> newbuntu: no
=== kr0n1x|away is now known as kr0n1x
[07:56] <orospakr> LjL, the texlive-latex-extra provides unicode opentype fonts?
[07:56] <tonyyarusso> orospakr: I know they work for Ojibway and probably Cree, not sure how complete they are or what the license is.
[07:56] <orospakr> huh, I didn't think that latex even used truetype
[07:56] <|CADE|> I wonder... Should I feel morally reprehensible for listening to Dane Cook?
[07:56] <LjL> orospakr: no, i guess it just provides fonts for TeX
[07:56] <orospakr> LjL, that's not really helpful...
[07:56] <newbuntu> do you literally direct connect to an ip?
[07:56] <orospakr> :(
[07:56] <tonyyarusso> sain: Not necessarily.
[07:57] <Commander-Crowe> LjL its a SATA
[07:57] <LjL> orospakr: then try tonyyarusso's suggestion
[07:57] <LjL> Commander-Crowe: shouldn't matter i think
[07:57] <sain> tonyyarusso, yes, not necessarily, but for practical purposes it is almost always true
[07:57] <tonyyarusso> Depends on the age bracket
[07:57] <newbuntu> LjL how do you search for files in direct connect?
[07:57] <sain> tonyyarusso, and level of interaction with the invaders i guess
[07:58] <LjL> newbuntu, peer to peer systems in general connect an IP address to another IP address "directly". but "Direct Connect" is also the name of a *specific* p2p system
[07:58] <Commander-Crowe> How do i turn off fsck?
[07:58] <LjL> newbuntu, depends on the client.
[07:58] <Commander-Crowe> on boot up
[07:58] <Commander-Crowe> that'll make more sense
[07:58] <rance> I have a server with two nics, one for external, one for internal, external interface is configured to obtain its address with dhcp.
[07:58] <rance> The dhcp server provides a domain-name-server ip for use in /etc/resolv.conf
[07:58] <newbuntu> I have it installed but it doesnt have "servers" built in and its hard to google anything about the gui
[07:59] <w3ccv> Commander-Crowe, edit the fstab file
[07:59] <sain> how does the ubuntu server distro compare to others distros like gentoo or debian?
[07:59] <orospakr> tonyyarusso, I can't find it... :(
[07:59] <rance> my question is how do I tell ubuntu to use a different ip than the one provided for the /etc/resolv.conf file
[07:59] <sain> isn't ubuntu primarily for desktops?
[07:59] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[07:59] <newbuntu> DC_gui2 is what its called
[07:59] <sain> rance, /etc/resolv is for your DNS servers
[07:59] <sindrum> no there is sever also
[08:00] <rance> sain: I know it is
[08:00] <newbuntu> ubuntu is for people who like free working OS
[08:00] <Nutubuntu> Okay ... Now I'm really puzzled. How do I decompress a Stuffit (.sit) file? The package macutils seems as if it *should* contain a utility called "unsit" that is said to do it; but it apparently only has the readme, not the util itself. I know Google is my friend, but my friend has let me down this time ...
[08:00] <sain> rance, then just edit that file
[08:00] <swanberg> just for the record, I apt-get remove xscreensaver-gl and that fixed my problem.
[08:00] <mixo8114> why can't the server cd have gui
[08:00] <sain> rance, what's the problem?
[08:00] <mixo8114> it's annoying
[08:00] <jrib> mixo8114: you can install any gui you want
[08:00] <mixo8114> good point
[08:00] <mixo8114> still annoying
[08:00] <Commander-Crowe> haha
[08:00] <Commander-Crowe> I found the problem
[08:00] <Commander-Crowe> it was in my fstab file

[08:01] <mixo8114> it
[08:01] <Commander-Crowe> ok thanks LjL
[08:01] <sain> rance, well?

[08:02] <rance> sain: my problem is that when my external interface gets its IP from the dhcp server it gets a domain-name-server in the dhcp packet, and it rewrites /etc/resolv.conf in response, I want to intercept that /etc/resolv.conf rewrite and fix the ip address

[08:02] <tonyyarusso> Ok
[08:02] <CarlFK> does installing  linux-image-686 in edgy just install linux-image-generic ?
[08:02] <orospakr> ooh, you've extracted them.
[08:02] <orospakr> that saves me from using wine. :)
[08:02] <ax> has anyone here setup software raid with ubuntu-server?
[08:03] <CarlFK> ax - I have.
[08:03] <sain> rance, you can usually adjust whether the nameserver is changed from the program you connect with
[08:03] <ax> CarlFK: do you ahve a good howto?
[08:03] <mc44> CarlFK: it should install generic, yes
[08:03] <kunee> my xorg..conf: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35314/
[08:04] <sain> rance, like for dial-up there is something you can change in the ppp config
[08:04] <DARKGuy> kunee: lemme check
[08:04] <shwag> dig mydomain.com   shows me where the ip resolves to, but its not listing the authoritative nameservers. How can I get these ?
[08:04] <CarlFK> cuz after instlaling nvidia-glx (which installed -386 and made it the default), then unistalling, then installing linux-image-686 - I still have -386 as the default
[08:04] <sindrum> paste thing is phat...
[08:04] <sain> shwag, trace?
[08:04] <rance> so you mean like dhclient.conf or dhcp connection or something like that?
[08:04] <CarlFK> mc44: thanks - at least I will stop trying that route.  any idea how I get nvidia and 686 at the same time?
[08:04] <sain> shwag, put +trace on the end

[08:05] <newbuntu> Why is it that when I have my ati card attached to the tv I see my desktop on the tv, but when i open xine or vlc (or any movie player) The screen is black on the TV... only if I open the movie in firefox do I see a picture...

[08:08] <Nutubuntu> sain, macs are fine for mac-people, and if I were one I'm sure I'd like it, but I'm just trying to uncompress a .sit archive :)
[08:08] <mc44> CarlFK: I dont have nvidia, so no. What part of the help page is wrong?

[08:09] <sain> Nutubuntu, you may have to write your own

[08:11] <morris> anyon eknow whats up with security.ubuntu.com, i get constant timeouts???
[08:11] <sain> rance, why don't you like the nameserver your ISP is giving you?
[08:11] <sain> rance, i hope you aren't downloading some kind of wierd porn

[08:11] <tonyyarusso> morris: PINGs at 115ms for me
[08:11] <sain> Nutubuntu, what is in that format that you want?

[08:13] <w3ccv> ajmitch, emacs has a C mode - I think it indents and colorizes syntax - maybe more features. once she gets over the initial learning curve of emacs and the shell history it's real easy, never leaving emacs.
[08:13] <sain> rance, like i say, it's a setting somewhere whether to accept the ISPs nameserver ... i'm not on ubuntu atm so i can't tell you
[08:13] <jinzo> has anybody builded a .deb packages for ubuntu ?
[08:13] <Nutubuntu> sain - it is an archive said to contain a set of free fonts from Apple -- kind of like the MS core fonts, but put out by Apple. I work with some designers who (naturally) seem to be macPeople, and the need arose to have one or two of the free fonts their boxen are shipped with
[08:13] <sain> rance, the setting will be in the program that makes the connection to your isp
[08:14] <rance> I looked in /etc/network/interfaces but didnt see it that
[08:14] <w3ccv> ajopaul_,  emacs has a C mode - I think it indents and colorizes syntax - maybe more features. once she gets over the initial learning curve of emacs and the shell history it's real easy, never leaving emacs.

[08:41] <Bryant214> MarcN: Its good to be free. I guess my first question would be how to rescue some of my backup files from a secondary harddrive i've got installed. It is NTFS format, and contians some work files and backup files from when i was using windows XP. I can't acess its contents at the moment. It says: You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "disks-conf-hdd1".
[08:41] <DARKGuy> kunee: Okay, let's try something else... if in ServerLayout, you comment the LFP Screen and DFP screen, and add a new line that says "Screen 0    "DFP Screen"   then restart X, does that turns on the secondary monitor?

[08:47] <taavi> i'm getting a version magic error
[08:47] <MarcN> b1shop: could also be that email is found via the thunderbird route too I suppose.  Evo uses exchange backend, thunderbird uses imap to exchange.

[08:53] <b1shop> MarcN: yup.  i just created an imap connection with thunderbird and it's indexing everything
[08:54] <b1shop> MarcN: odd.  i see posts on various sites that say beagle works with evolution and exchange as a connector
[08:54] <snedar> kimmem: right click a video file and choose Properties. you can choose with which app you want to open it. about the window decorations: do you use ubuntu or kubuntu (ubuntu with kde)?

=== acez is now known as aceZ
[09:07] <MarcN> kimmern: you are missing some development packages needed to compile whatever package you are working with.  If that package has already been put in ubuntu, you can have those development packages installed by doing:           sudo apt-get build-dep somepackage
[09:08] <LjL> x-r00t-x: "After it is installed, run Applications->System Tools->Firestarter to configure your firewall. The firewall will now start in the background when your computer starts." (from https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/networking.html ) - so it seems it should do it by default
[09:08] <beerockxs> i'm using a radeon X1900GT with the fglrx driver, and have 2 problems.
[09:08] <beerockxs> 1) I can't switch to a non-X console after starting X, all I get is a colorfully garbled screen.
[09:08] <Bryant214> MY NTFS drive was automatically mounted for me upon installing Ubuntu. However i do not have premission to acess it from the file browser. Does anyone know how i might gain permission to view those files?
[09:08] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  tnx
[09:09] <beerockxs> 2) I can't resume from suspend-to-ram
[09:09] <beerockxs> anyone have any ideas how to fix that?
[09:09] <battlesquid> im trying to set up netspeed on my desktop. i have restarted the panel as needed, but i'm having a hard completing this step: "install the applet at the same location as the rest of gnome2. (The applet-.server-file has to be located at the same place where all the other .server-files are - usually /GNOME2_PATH/lib/bonobo/servers/)." i used synaptic package manager to install...
[09:10] <LjL> beerockxs: for suspend to RAM, no idea, except try tinkering around with /etc/default/acpi-support... for question 1, you could try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg", and when asked whether you want to use framebuffer switching, change the default answer (if it's Yes, say No, if it's No, say Yes)
[09:11] <beerockxs> thanks LjL

[09:12] <LjL> beerockxs: "For those running the fglrx driver, you need uncomment the line in /etc/default/fglrx, so it reads as    FGLRX_ACPI_SWITCH_POWERSTATES=true "  from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SuspendHowto
[09:12] <beerockxs> LjL: ohh, that's a good tip. thanks again
[09:12] <battlesquid> basically i'm wondering if i need to make a symlink to the installation somewhere. but i can't figure out where "the rest of gnome2" is i.e. GNOME2_PATH

[09:13] <shwag__> I thought I did the exact same thing to set each of these servers up, but somehow one ended up with apache2-mpm-prefork, and the other ended up with apache2-mpm-worker. Any ideas on how that could have happened?
[09:14] <Jonas_Alves> hello
[09:14] <LjL> beerockxs: well, those instructions say they're for Dapper, if you're on Edgy it might be different. also, did you install the fglrx driver from the repositories?
[09:14] <battlesquid> trying a new approach, is anyone here running netspeed on edgy?
[09:14] <carden> is it my imagination or are the files missing from libwxbase-2.8-0?

[09:15] <Jonas_Alves> i'm using Kopete messenger with Ubuntu in Gnome..

[09:22] <hajiki> LjL: no, how do i do that???
[09:22] <LjL> !verify | hajiki
[09:22] <ubotu> hajiki: To mount an .iso image: sudo mount -o loop my.iso /some/mountpoint - bin/cue can be converted to iso with bchunk  .iso images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com Always verify the .iso before burning, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[09:22] <svip> Which codecs, Jonas_Alves?
[09:23] <hajiki> thanks

[09:26] <OdiiN> how can i block the installation of a certain package with aptitude or apt-get ?
[09:26] <gnomefreak> !pinning | OdiiN
[09:26] <ubotu> OdiiN: pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[09:26] <LjL> OdiiN: if that package is required by another package that you need to install, you don't do that
[09:26] <hajiki> LjL: so practically ill have to burn another cd, right??
[09:26] <hajiki> :(
[09:26] <LjL> hajiki: unless it's something fishier, yes.
[09:26] <LjL> hajiki: do verify your current CD first to make sure.
[09:26] <hajiki> damn
[09:26] <loki505> ok i just upgraded my ubuntu to 6.10 and all well but everytime i open up azureus its open and everting but its doesnt show up the icon my the clock
[09:27] <hajiki> ok
[09:27] <loki505> the azureus icon doesnt show up by the clock
[09:27] <lifepositive> loki505: how did you upgrade from Dapper to 6.10?
[09:27] <loki505> but its open through cause my torrents r downloading
[09:27] <OdiiN> ubotu, i only want to block MONSTER applications of kubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop, as koffice
[09:27] <loki505> yea
[09:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i only want to block MONSTER applications of kubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop, as koffice - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:28] <loki505> i just upgraded
[09:28] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: gksudo "update-manager -c"
[09:28] <bXi> anyone here ever experienced a broken usplash?
[09:28] <CarlFK> is there a .deb for the latest nvidia binary? (the one in 'restricted' isn't as current as http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-9629.html )
[09:28] <sindrum> just add notification thing
[09:28] <gnomefreak> bXi: many people
[09:28] <LjL> OdiiN: then don't install ubuntu-desktop and/or kubuntu-desktop. and ubotu is a bot.
[09:28] <loki505> yeah
[09:28] <loki505> i did
[09:28] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop | OdiiN
[09:28] <ubotu> OdiiN: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[09:28] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: I need the 6.10 DVD for that right?
[09:28] <loki505> the lil blue frog still wont show up
[09:28] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: no just the net repos enabled
[09:28] <bXi> gnomefreak: its the first time i'm seeing this out of several installations
[09:29] <boink> Odiin: the only way to do that is not to give them the root passwd
[09:29] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: using a modem is tough for me :P
[09:29] <sindrum> you went throught he settings ... right?
[09:29] <LjL> Ubotu, tell CarlFK about nvidia9 | CarlFK, see the private message from Ubotu
[09:29] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: can I upgrade to 6.10 using a modem a few files per day?
[09:29] <bXi> ubotu: tell me about ati
[09:29] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: than you will need the alternate cd to do it if you dont want to use the net repos
[09:29] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: no
[09:29] <CarlFK> LjL: thanks
[09:29] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: thats a good way to break things
[09:29] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: so i will need the CD!  but they wont send it to me for free
[09:30] <LjL> gnomefreak: why not?
[09:30] <gnomefreak> nope you have to download and burn it
[09:30] <gnomefreak> LjL: what?
[09:30] <LjL> gnomefreak: why can't split it in a couple of days?
[09:30] <gnomefreak> LjL: few files per day on a dist-upgrade from dapper to edgy?
[09:30] <malc_> how do I completely uninstall apache removing all traces of it from my system (config files etc)
[09:30] <OdiiN> LjL i want kde with all resources as dcop and without big apps as koffice, kaffeine, etc that i will never use, kde-core did not have all that i want, is that posible?
[09:30] <gnomefreak> LjL: what package depends on other packages that might not get installed at same time
[09:30] <LjL> gnomefreak: yeah. well, on an update-manager preferably... although i never used update-manager
[09:31] <LjL> gnomefreak: hm? don't get you. of course you wouldn't be *installing* the packages, you'd just be *downloading* them
[09:31] <gnomefreak> its ok to split it just dont shut it down
[09:31] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: I cant download it using a modem
[09:31] <lifepositive> LjL: ahh great idea
[09:31] <gnomefreak> didnt think of that
[09:31] <gnomefreak> lol
[09:31] <lifepositive> LjL: so I can download the packages?
[09:31] <LjL> lifepositive: well, actually, why not? if you can download the files, you can download the CD
[09:32] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: we just learned something new from LjL :)
[09:32] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: use bittorrent and you can download the imiage in steps
[09:32] <lifepositive> LjL: but using a modem will take about 30 days wont it? :)
[09:32] <gnomefreak> image*
[09:32] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: how can I do that?
[09:32] <LjL> lifepositive: i think so. but then downloading the CD shouldn't be any harder... i'd still go with the files, though. "apt-get update", "apt-get --download-only dist-upgrade", and then use update-manager
[09:32] <gnomefreak> thats safer than trying to do the upgrade way
[09:32] <CarlFK> LjL: given you know something about nvidia... any idea how to get it to use a 686 kernel?
[09:32] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: you can pause the download
[09:32] <mc44> malc_: apt-get --purge remove
[09:32] <LjL> lifepositive: it probably will, but then downloading the files will take just as long, probably
[09:33] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: how can I dl using bitorrent?
[09:33] <malc_> mc44 thanks
[09:33] <lifepositive> LjL: ok! ill download the image
[09:33] <LjL> CarlFK: no... but are you sure you want to be using a 686 kernel? ;)
[09:33] <LjL> !generic | CarlFK
[09:33] <ubotu> CarlFK: Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[09:33] <lifepositive> LjL: how do I download the image? :)
[09:33] <LjL> lifepositive: ... with wget?
[09:33] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: go to the site to get the iso click on the torrent one and douple click the saved file it will open with a torrent client
[09:34] <gnomefreak> double even
[09:34] <LjL> lifepositive: but really, *i* would download the files, and let APT check the checksums and all, rather than spend a month downloading a CD image which might turn out to be corrupted
[09:34] <VigoSandy> Greetings
[09:34] <lifepositive> LjL: ah yes!  Ill use wget :)
[09:34] <CarlFK> LjL: problem is the nvidia package ends up installing the 386 specific on on my p4
[09:34] <lifepositive> LjL: hmm!  so how would i do that?
[09:34] <LjL> CarlFK: it shouldn't do that. i have it installed (the amaranth one i pointed you to) and i still have my standard generic kernel
[09:34] <lifepositive> LjL: sorry I dont understand how to do it
[09:34] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: are you using the 386 kernel atm?
[09:34] <Raskall> ARGH.. character sets are starting to annoy me. how do I set the default? Suddenly my default charset (in gnome-terminal) is ANSI_X3.4-1989 instead of UTF-8
[09:35] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: you mean ubuntu.org?
[09:35] <gnomefreak> ubuntu.com
[09:35] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: ok
[09:35] <LjL> lifepositive: i told you - "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get --download-only dist-upgrade". and then, when it's finished downloading all of it (you can interrupt it whenever you like, however many times as you want) *then* use the standard upgrading process (i.e. update-manager), which shouldn't download much if anything anymore
[09:35] <LjL> !upgrade | lifepositive
[09:35] <ubotu> lifepositive: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[09:35] <MonkeeOfEvil> never been to that site before ;)
[09:35] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: yup - uname -a 2.6.17-10-386
[09:35] <CarlFK> LjL: Setting up linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386 (2.6.17.6-2~amaranth) ...
[09:35] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: boot to the generic kernel or 686 kernel depending on what ubuntu you are on
[09:35] <lifepositive> LjL: ok thank you
[09:36] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: that shouldnt be up any more
[09:36] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: someone else took over those packages
[09:36] <LjL> CarlFK: here "Package `linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386' is not installed."
[09:36] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: im pinging the guy that took them over
[09:37] <lifepositive> LjL: roughly how much would it come to?  about 500mb?
[09:37] <Sinistrad> How can I disable screen-blanking in X.org? (it's seems to be using the acpi monitor-turn-off type of blanking)
[09:37] <LjL> gnomefreak: they're still called ~amaranth though i guess
[09:37] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: thanks.
[09:37] <VigoSandy> I am downloading another 6.10 before I wipe this XP off this box, the 30 day warranty expired 2 hours ago :-)
[09:37] <LjL> lifepositive: i don't really know... well, of course it also depends on which packages you have installed. on a vanilla installation, yeah, i guess something less (not by much) than the size of the Alternate CD, so 500Mb to 600Mb
[09:38] <lifepositive> LjL: hmm! that will take about 3 months ;) hehe
[09:38] <lifepositive> LjL: do I really need to upgrade from Dapper?
[09:38] <CarlFK> LjL: my 386 'problem' started with  http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/virtual/nvidia-kernel-1.0.8776  (only 386
[09:38] <LjL> lifepositive: can't you just get some friend who's got a faster connection to burn a CD for you?
[09:38] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: boot to the other kernel
[09:38] <LjL> lifepositive: probably not
[09:38] <Lam_> cksfv or cfv?
[09:38] <lifepositive> LjL: yeah ill try!
[09:38] <LjL> lifepositive: what makes you think you do?
[09:38] <lifepositive> LjL: security reasons
[09:39] <LjL> lifepositive: security?
[09:39] <abarbaccia> hello all - im missing a config.h file in my linux-headers directory - how do i get one?
[09:39] <lifepositive> LjL: i thought its more secure than Dapper
[09:39] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: on edgy you should have a generic kernel install it with the generic l-r-m packages if nto already installed
[09:39] <LjL> lifepositive: wouldn't see why
[09:39] <lifepositive> LjL: as I use a lot of netbaking and money websites
[09:39] <lifepositive> LjL: ok
[09:39] <sanmarcos> !root > sanmarcos
[09:39] <LjL> CarlFK: well then what if you just try removing the -386 package?
[09:39] <[^Twen^] > any places I can choose which processes who's gonna start when the computer is starting?
[09:39] <lifepositive> LjL: ill stay with Dapper then for now
[09:39] <LjL> lifepositive, Dapper is supported for longer than Edgy, so it'll still be getting security updates when Edgy won't anymore
[09:39] <LjL> !lts | lifepositive
[09:39] <ubotu> lifepositive: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[09:40] <VigoSandy> Will the gpart ute get rid of XP? or do I have to erase the XP Bootloader\fastdetect before the install?
[09:40] <lifepositive> LjL: and one day my local computer magazines will proably release 6.10
[09:40] <lifepositive> LjL: ok cheers
[09:40] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: booting to the oringinal -generic.  the 386 one came when I install nvidia-glx
[09:40] <lifepositive> LjL: ill stay with dapper for now then!  thanks for your help
[09:40] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: bootint into generic now (other box)
[09:41] <Solarion> hahaha
[09:41] <LjL> lifepositive: if it ain't broke, don't fix it ;)
[09:41] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: thats fine you will receive some 386 stuff with it but boot to genericv and install them
[09:41] <Solarion> I just saw all the spam at 13:13.
[09:41] <Solarion> If Microsoft keeps this up, I can see why Longh^H^H^H^HVista has been so late....  ;)
[09:41] <lifepositive> LjL: yeah, good advice :)  and Dapper is running great for me atm
[09:42] <Lam_> !md5
[09:42] <ubotu> To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[09:42] <Lam_> how do i generate an md5 checksum file?
[09:42] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: booted -generic: (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!
[09:42] <lifepositive> LjL: and every day I log in, I type: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.  Is that what I shgould be doing?
[09:43] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: remove it and inistall it again
[09:43] <Sinistrad> Lam_, the md5sum is probably what you're looking for.
[09:43] <gnomefreak> install even
[09:43] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: want me to remove -386 too?
[09:43] <lifepositive> instead of typing 2 separate commands, can I instead type: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[09:43] <LjL> lifepositive: that's what i do
[09:43] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: no just remove nvidia-glx and anything that will be removed with it is fine
[09:43] <lifepositive> LjL: sounds good :)
[09:43] <LjL> lifepositive: but then if you have the automatic update notifier enabled, you shouldn't need that
[09:43] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: than just install it again
[09:43] <lifepositive> LjL: true true
[09:43] <wizo> anyone knows how i can specify a password to join a wireless network? i can connect to a un protected network fine, but not a protected one even when i use key s:password in plain text
[09:44] <Lam_> Sinistrad: do you know how to make it create a md5sum file?
[09:44] <LjL> lifepositive: yes you can, or "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[09:44] <Sinistrad> Lam_, redirect it's output to a file, e.g.: md5sum some_file > some_file.md5
[09:44] <lifepositive> LjL: ahh great, ty
[09:44] <Lam_> Sinistrad: ok thanks
[09:44] <capiCrimm> Anyone know how I can get support.o?
[09:45] <LjL> lifepositive: or open up your ~/.bashrc , and add     alias upgrade="sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude dist-upgrade; sudo aptitude search ~N" ;-)
[09:45] <IdleOne> how do I remove more then one package at a time?
[09:45] <LjL> Ubotu, tell lifepositive about aptitude | lifepositive, see the private message from Ubotu
[09:45] <Lam_> Sinistrad: do you know if md5sum can recursively enter directories and checksum those files as well?
[09:45] <LjL> lifepositive: since you're on Dapper, you might find aptitude handy over apt-get (Edgy has that feature built in right in apt-get)
[09:45] <gnomefreak> IdleOne: sudo apt-get remove package package package
[09:45] <IdleOne> gnomefreak, thanks I knew you would answer :)
[09:45] <lifepositive> LjL: whats the difference between apt-get -u dist-upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[09:45] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: removed and installed.  what next? (guessing restart gdm ?)
[09:45] <LjL> Lam_: find | xargs md5sum
[09:45] <lamego> Lam_, you can that with find
[09:46] <lifepositive> LjL: ok thankls
[09:46] <LjL> Lam_: or something ;)
[09:46] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: make sure the driver is nvidia in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:46] <Lam_> LjL, lamego: thanks :)
[09:46] <lamego> find dir -type f -exec md5sum {} \;
[09:46] <LjL> lifepositive: man apt-get ;)
[09:46] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: also make sure it installed l-r-m package for -generic
[09:46] <lifepositive> LjL: :)
[09:46] <capiCrimm> Anyone even know what support.o is for?
[09:46] <lifepositive> LjL: so cant apt-get remove things as well as aptitude can?
[09:46] <lamego> capiCrimm, an .object file to be linked with something :)
[09:46] <gnomefreak> an object file
[09:47] <kimmern> Anyone here using icewm on kubuntu? maybe a stupid question, but how do i change the default theme? there isn't any gui to do it on..as far as I found..
[09:47] <LjL> Lam_: lamego's sounds much better. my xargs command would have required a -print0 option to find, and also an -n 1 (or somethign) option to xargs
[09:47] <lamego> it would not require -print, but yest it would require xargs -n1 :)
[09:47] <capiCrimm> lamego, I know that. I mean, why would someone link it? It's purpose. It seems to come with the kernel so I'm assuiming it's somewhat essential.
[09:48] <Lam_> ok thanks a lot :)
[09:48] <gnomefreak> brb
[09:48] <LjL> lifepositive: it can remove things just fine, but it won't remove the *dependencies* of those things
[09:48] <lamego> capiCrimm, it coul just be a temporary object file required for the kernel build
=== Wildfire_ is now known as Wildfire|edgy
[09:48] <mc44> capiCrimm: binary only drivers are linked at boot time for GPL reasons, as an example
[09:48] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: what if it didn't install l-r-m-generic ? (which it won't, cuz it isn't listed on http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/virtual/nvidia-kernel-1.0.8776 )
[09:49] <IdleOne> LjL,  so I should use aptitude to also remove dependencies?
[09:49] <LjL> lifepositive: you see... when you install most programs, you'll see apt-get (or aptitude, or whatever) telling you "ok, i'll install X, but note that X also requires Y and Z, so i'll install those too". that's fine, and it's handy... but if you decide to remove X later, Y and Z won't be removed (hey, they might still be used by other packages after all)
[09:49] <capiCrimm> hrm, well I'm trying to compile some OpenGL code and the makefile dying on ld -lsupport...
[09:49] <LjL> lifepositive: with aptitude, or Edgy's apt-get, Y and Z *will* be removed, *after* checking that no other package requires them
[09:49] <maggotin> I installed ATI drivers using the beryl project tutorial, and now things are going slow and when I do fglrxinfo i get guille@guille:~$ fglrxinfo

[09:50] <^Ocean^> Does the Weather Dockapp no longer work?
[09:50] <LjL> IdleOne: only if you used aptitude to install the stuff in the first place. aptitude has its internal database of dependencies that were installed automatically -- it doesn't know anything about those installed by apt-get, so won't help with them
[09:50] <ski-worklap> do people really play quake on linux?
[09:50] <lamego> ski-worklap, yes they do

[09:50] <maggotin>  installed ATI drivers using the beryl project tutorial, and now things are going slow and when I do fglrxinfo i get http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35327/
[09:51] <ski-worklap> that was unnecesssry
[09:51] <LjL> ski-worklap: that's offtopic *and* trolling. stop.
[09:51] <mc44> !ohmy | ski-worklap
[09:51] <ubotu> ski-worklap: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:51] <lamego> capiCrimm, -l indicates a library name... usually lib*.so or lib*.a

[09:51] <xst> I'm about to by a new mouse and am considering a Logitech VX which should be extremely configurable. But this configuration stuff is done from software that is only available on Windows - I guess. Does anyone have any linux/ubuntu experiences with this mouse (or could you recommend another one that works well?)
[09:51] <maggotin> instead of getting my  videocard name and model
[09:51] <CarlFK> ski-worklap: be nice.
[09:51] <ski-worklap> how on earth is talking about binary video drivers offtopic?
[09:52] <LjL> ski-worklap: "Official Ubuntu Support Channel". you ask support questions. period. no trolling.
[09:52] <^Ocean^> Does the Weather Dockapp no longer work?
[09:52] <Cald> hello
[09:52] <maggotin> so, can anybody help me?
[09:52] <ski-worklap> ljl - i think you misinterpreted what i said. the wikipedia "assume good faith" adage comes to mind
[09:52] <Cald> does someone know how can i limit bandwidth, or set priority to bandwidth, per user in the system plz ?
[09:52] <LjL> Ubotu, tell ski-worklap about openweek | ski-worklap, see the private message from Ubotu
[09:52] <lamego> maggotin, forget beryl , first just setup your ATI driver, help.ubuntu.com
[09:53] <LjL> ski-worklap: read the Ask Mark transcript if you want to know more about what you asked. and if you want to discuss it, #ubuntu-offtopic
[09:53] <IdleOne> LjL,  few months back someone told me about a way to create shortcuts for the comand line : sudo apt-get install = sudo agi and so on. how do i do that ?
[09:53] <LjL> IdleOne: "help alias"
[09:53] <IdleOne> Thank you again
[09:53] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: are you using ubuntu repos to grab nvidia or amaranths repo?
[09:53] <LjL> IdleOne: i used to have       alias upgrade="sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude dist-upgrade; sudo aptitude search ~N"
[09:53] <LjL> IdleOne: you need to put that in your .bashrc to make it stick
[09:54] <gnomefreak> LjL: search ~N?
[09:54] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: both.  the 386 problem came before i used amaranths
[09:54] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: it will grab it from amatanths repo as it is the newer versions if you are using the 9xxx drivers you need his l-r-m-c and l-r-m-generic
[09:54] <LjL> gnomefreak: shows new packages (i.e. packages that were not there / had a different version since the last time you typed "sudo aptitude forget-new").   though the "sudo" there is completely gratuitous admittedly (idleOne, note this)
[09:55] <Cald> no idea for bandwidth control ?
[09:55] <AnN0nx> how do i install tcl8.4 and ALL of its dependencys ?
[09:55] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: and given what I see on http://packages.ubuntu.com I can kinda see why installing nvida-glx will pull in 386, wich i am gussing is a bug (but am a bitt to mess up to be sure)
[09:55] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: not a bug you still have the 386 kernel
[09:55] <capiCrimm> do'h. support.a way included in a subfolder, had to compile it first.
[09:55] <gnomefreak> ah ty ljl i might add htat
[09:55] <ZeZu> for 6.10 is the "Desktop CD" the same as in the prev. version, IE a Live CD ?  I had many problems with it, and i'd like to get the proper cd to install from, with X and no Live CD support
[09:56] <lifepositive> LjL: ok thanks for telling me about aptitude. appreciate it
[09:56] <carden> ok so has anyone tried to install libwxbase2.8? it seems to me it is missing the libraries
[09:56] <cafuego_> ZeZu: That would be the 'alternate'
[09:56] <Tallomori> !list
[09:56] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[09:56] <gnomefreak> ZeZu: desktop cd = installable live cd
[09:56] <ZeZu> ok
[09:56] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: you don't think downgrading my kernel is a bug?
[09:56] <lifepositive> LjL: so when using apt-get, what happens to those *dependencies*?  they just sit around on the HD wasting space?
[09:56] <maggotin> I followed the same method that help.ubuntu.com says when installing ati drivers, and I get http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35327/
[09:56] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: 386 is not a downgrade from generic
[09:57] <neeru> can anyone help me set my widescreen resolution properly so it works under beryl

[09:57] <neeru> ive edited my xorg and when i select 1440x900 in screen res, the screen chops itself up into random paices and goes everywhere
[09:57] <ozoneco> what is stopping me?
[09:57] <neeru> can any1 help please
[09:58] <LjL> lifepositive: yes
[09:58] <cafuego_> ozoneco: th'a your firewall intercepting an ssh packet.
[09:58] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: why is there -generic if -386 is not a downgrade ?
[09:58] <boink> !tell neeru about ask
[09:58] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: 386 == processor like p1
[09:58] <lifepositive> LjL: so can I type this every day instead from now on then: sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitud dist-upgrade ?
[09:59] <jdfellow> sound question can you help?
[09:59] <LjL> lifepositive: packages such as "deborphan" or "debfoster" can help you a bit with finding them and getting rid of them, but you have to spend time on that. (in particular, debfoster can be sort of dangerous if you're not sure what you're doing)
[09:59] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: the 386 == 386mhz or less processor
[09:59] <neeru> boink i dont understand
[09:59] <^Ocean^> uhh
[09:59] <lifepositive> LjL: yeah I understand
[09:59] <^Ocean^> a 386 runs at like 15mhz max
[09:59] <gnomefreak> AnN0nx: use synaptic i cant remember the full name of it
[09:59] <LjL> lifepositive: well, it doesn't really matter that much with updates... it matters when you install new packages. but yeah, i used to use aptitude for upgrades as well
[09:59] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: right.  so the 386 kernel is a downgrade from generic, right?  (trying to figure out why you would say "386 is not a downgrade from generic" )
[09:59] <the_Grinch> is there a command I can run from a terminal window to allow me to log someone off?  somehow my account is logged in twice on my computer...
[09:59] <^Ocean^> i rember when a 486 ran at 66mhz and it was like HOLY
[09:59] <AnN0nx> <gnomefreak> its my shel  i need to use the terminal
[10:00] <jdfellow> quit
=== reus is now known as megar0m
[10:00] <lifepositive> LjL: from now on I will type: sudo aptitude install ....
[10:00] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: not a downgrade a downgrade would be 2.6.17-5 comparded to 2.6.17-6
[10:00] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: and as far as I know, linux never run on a 286
[10:00] <lifepositive> LjL: sounds good
[10:00] <Seveas> CarlFK, wasn't there a port once?
[10:00] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: a 286 would run the 386 kernel
[10:00] <Seveas> gnomefreak, it can't....
[10:00] <zylche> Can someone help me fix my sound drivers?
[10:01] <gnomefreak> Seveas: why not?
[10:01] <Seveas> gnomefreak, linux needs an MMU, 286 hasn't got one
[10:01] <CarlFK> Seveas: not that I am aware of.  needs 4 meg of ram or somehting, which a 286 can never do (right?)
[10:01] <ozoneco> thanks cafuego
[10:01] <^Ocean^> zylche, whats wrong with it ?
[10:01] <gnomefreak> Seveas: server cant run on 286?
[10:01] <zylche> It's not working? :P
=== caplink811 is now known as caplink811_log
[10:01] <^Ocean^> lol
[10:01] <Seveas> gnomefreak, the kernel can't run on it
[10:01] <gnomefreak> ah
[10:01] <^Ocean^> zylche: need some more details than that...
[10:01] <Seveas> and was never designed to be able to run on less than 386
[10:01] <zylche> fire commands away :P
[10:01] <VigoSandy> The_Grinch: Shut Down, Switch user, Log off, switch user, log on
[10:01] <lifepositive> LjL: but aptitude wont help me now with stuff I already installed using apt-get will it?
[10:01] <^Ocean^> zylche: okay first of all
[10:02] <LjL> lifepositive: no it won't. stuff like deborphan is the only option
[10:02] <^Ocean^> zylche: do you get any errors when tryin to play a sound file ?  And if so what errors do you get ?
[10:02] <LjL> lifepositive: well, short of manually going through all packages
[10:02] <zylche> no errors, sound just doesn't play, volume is max and nothing is muted
[10:02] <zylche> ..and speakers /are/ on :P
[10:02] <lifepositive> LjL: ok
[10:02] <^Ocean^> zylche: okay try this echo test < /dev/dsp
[10:03] <lifepositive> LjL: wish I had have known about aptitude months ago :)
[10:03] <zylche> ..that only echo'ed test. .. hm..
[10:03] <^Ocean^> err
[10:03] <^Ocean^> try this
[10:03] <^Ocean^> echo test > /dev/dsp
[10:03] <zylche> that could overwrite it..
[10:03] <sysrage> cat /dev/mouse > /dev/dsp
[10:03] <gnomefreak> AnN0nx: you are done pming me now please ask in the channel flooding my pm will not help you get helped at all
[10:03] <^Ocean^> zylche, no it dont
[10:04] <gnomefreak> AnN0nx: hint sudo apt-get -f install
[10:04] <LjL> lifepositive: well, deborphan (that's the package, the command you probably want to run is "orphaner") will be handy though, i think. it only looks for unused *libraries*, so there's not too much danger of removing packages that you actually want. it will miss some, on the other hand, but
[10:04] <^Ocean^> zylche, that will tell me if u have ur permissions set right for ur sound card :)
[10:04] <LjL> sysrage: nice one
[10:04] <Stormx2> Yo all. How do I change my default mixer to OSS?
[10:04] <sysrage> ljl: it's fun :)
[10:04] <mc44> LjL: apt-get now has magic auto dep remove capabilities
[10:04] <zylche> Would you believe nothing came out
[10:05] <lifepositive> LjL: ok cheers
[10:05] <^Ocean^> zylche, yup thats okay...
[10:05] <^Ocean^> zylche, okay just humor me....  type sudo xmms
[10:05] <LjL> mc44: in Edgy. we were talking about Dapper
[10:05] <Stormx2> I remember being able to do it in Breezy
[10:05] <malt> anyone know how much memory the D-Link DGL-4300 has?
[10:05] <Stormx2> but I can't remember....
[10:05] <lifepositive> mc44: im using Dapper only
[10:05] <Stormx2> malt: Google?

[10:06] <Lefungus> hello, Does anyone know how to boot ubuntu live cd from an external usb cdrom ?
[10:06] <^Ocean^> zylche, hmm thats odd lol... okay try this sudo mpg123 afile :)
[10:06] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Lefungus about boot | Lefungus, see the private message from Ubotu
[10:07] <lifepositive> LjL: when I run orphaner, it only shows 3 gstreamer files to be removed :P
[10:07] <zylche> mpg123 isn't installed ;)
[10:07] <Lefungus> it's not working for me, while I know I can boot from it since it did work with windows install cd

[10:07] <Lefungus> (from the external usb cdrom)
[10:08] <Cald> does someone know how can i limit bandwidth, or set priority to bandwidth, per user in the system plz ?
[10:08] <VigoSandy> Lefungus: Is external set as slave?
[10:08] <LjL> Lefungus, if your BIOS doesn't support that, i guess you just can't do it. but the page i gave you (the second one, the first was wrong) gives you other possible methods for booting the CD, like using a floppy disk or a USB key
[10:08] <Lefungus> it's an usb drive, I don't think it has such thing as slave/master
[10:09] <zch_> hi, can someone tell me the sources.list entry for http://people.ubuntu.com/~doko/ubuntu/edgy/i386/ ?
[10:09] <Lefungus> the box is enclosed anyway, no way to pop it open and check
[10:09] <VigoSandy> Was worth a try
[10:09] <lifepositive> LjL: when I run deborphan it shows 3 files.. gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse and gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse and gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad. Am I safe to remove these?
[10:09] <Lefungus> I'll try the usb key boot option, it should work
[10:09] <zylche> 3 lines, message it?
[10:09] <Lefungus> thanks for the links

[10:19] <lordmaynoth2> i think
[10:19] <lordmaynoth2> i made a backup partition
[10:19] <lordmaynoth2> when I installed edgy
[10:19] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: is this a one time thing or you want it to always get mounted?
[10:19] <VigoSandy> bmc:Its like a updater thing, or if you see something you like, look it up, or try it out. Its pretty straightforward,,,<<<<tuxically challenged, I blame windoze

[10:22] <limpbizcuit> can anyone help me?
[10:22] <ubotu> VigoSandy: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.

[10:24] <lordmaynoth2> how do i check
[10:24] <dan14> does anyone know of a good howto for installing extensions in firefox? i keep getting an error like "cant install file at file://home/***"
[10:24] <limpbizcuit> oh i didnt know that soory for any inconvience
[10:24] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: try 'sudo fdisk -l' to get a list
[10:24] <lordmaynoth2> isn't there an automagic way to config paritions

[10:25] <limpbizcuit> i was following a ubuntu wiki
[10:25] <josorio> hola
[10:25] <jrib> limpbizcuit: can you give us a link?
[10:25] <LjL> dan14: it should work smoothly. i'm guessing that, for some reason, some permissions aren't set correctly in your firefox directory... perhaps try "chown -R yourusername:yourusername ~/.firefox"
[10:25] <Tachoh> my mic capture is turned on, mic boost is on, the mic is selected for recording, if i turn up the volume on the mic i can hear myself talk, i have the right permissions to access the sound devices, the correct modules are loaded. audacity is pointing to /dev/dsp as the recording device. any idea why i cannot record sound?
[10:25] <limpbizcuit> sure let me look it up
[10:26] <limpbizcuit> http://easylinux.info/wiki/Ubuntu#How_to_add_extra_repositories
[10:26] <jrib> limpbizcuit: also, just let us know what you were trying to do with automatix and we can help you with that too
[10:26] <LjL> limpbizcuit: that's not the Ubuntu wiki
[10:26] <Tachoh> tried with mic 1 and mic2 in alsamixer, recording volume is turned up in audacity
[10:26] <LjL> Ubotu, tell limpbizcuit about repositories | limpbizcuit, see the private message from Ubotu
[10:26] <LjL> limpbizcuit: this is the Ubuntu wiki
[10:26] <limpbizcuit> ok
[10:26] <lordmaynoth2> oh
[10:27] <lordmaynoth2> thanks but that script said it was for windows partitions only
[10:27] <lordmaynoth2> :(
[10:27] <LjL> limpbizcuit: http://help.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com are the supported places to look at
[10:27] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: it does ext3 as well I believe
[10:27] <lordmaynoth2> ok its /dev/hda3   (ext3)
[10:28] <A_24> Which file do I need to edit to adjust the time it takes for a connection to the net to time out?
[10:28] <limpbizcuit> ok so the other stuff is just stuff that random people put together?
[10:28] <VigoSandy> Now, do I have to format both partitions and is that doable with gpart?
[10:28] <dsquare> how do i get root please because i tried to run gparted and it says Root privileges are required for running GParted Since GParted can be a weapon of mass destruction only root may run it.
[10:28] <limpbizcuit> unoficial
[10:28] <lordmaynoth2> how do I add /dev/hda3 to the fstab
[10:28] <lordmaynoth2> sorry I am so stupid
[10:29] <Tachoh> my mic capture is turned on, mic boost is on, the mic is selected for recording, if i turn up the volume on the mic i can hear myself talk, i have the right permissions to access the sound devices, the correct modules are loaded. audacity is pointing to /dev/dsp as the recording device. any idea why i cannot record sound?
[10:29] <ianni> fd
[10:29] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: ok, first step is you have to create a mount point.  So:   sudo mkdir /media/hda3        or whatever name you want
[10:29] <budluva_> disasm, are you running from terminal?
[10:29] <bmc> which one should i download and how can i install this gaim plugin? https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=141362&package_id=155388
[10:29] <budluva_> dsquare, are you running from terminal? (GParted
[10:29] <lordmaynoth2> sudo mkdir /media/hda3  then a name for it
=== tomcat is now known as globe
[10:30] <LjL> limpbizcuit: precisely. well, the Ubuntu wiki is also community-created, but it's got some supervision from Ubuntu members
[10:30] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: no, hda3 was the example name
[10:30] <lordmaynoth2> oh
[10:30] <lordmaynoth2> okies
[10:30] <dsquare> budluva yes i tried to run it from terminal i just typed "gparted" and that message popped up in gnome
[10:30] <lordmaynoth2> how does it know to mount hda3 tho
[10:30] <LjL> limpbizcuit: in particular, what's at http://help.ubuntu.com/community is community mantained, while http://help.ubuntu.com itself is the official Ubuntu guide
[10:30] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: we will tell it in fstab
[10:30] <bur[n] er> anyone know if something like this http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?InvtId=AU-100-UPC&AID=10440852&CJPID=1798476&cm_ven=CJ&cm_pla=1798476&cm_ite=REDIRECT-ProductSpecific_Text_9-11-2006&cm_cat=1635414 will work in ubuntu?
[10:30] <budluva_> dsquare, ok, then type: sudo gparted
[10:30] <lordmaynoth2> oooh
[10:30] <lordmaynoth2> okies
[10:30] <lordmaynoth2> sry
[10:30] <budluva_> dsquare, and enter your password
[10:30] <limpbizcuit> ok
[10:30] <dsquare> budluva, thank you.
[10:31] <Sleft> hello, I've got problems booting windows with grub
[10:31] <bXi> is the standard firefox theme in edgy available for download?
[10:31] <budluva_> dsquare, np
[10:31] <lordmaynoth2> ok
[10:31] <lordmaynoth2> I did the mkdir
[10:31] <jerp> in apt-get, what happens with the option:    dselect-upgrade
[10:31] <mc44> Sleft: what is the problem?
[10:31] <lordmaynoth2> and have fstab open with sudo gedit
[10:32] <Sleft> when I try too boot windows grub shows the commands it does and nothing happens
[10:32] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: this is the line to add: /dev/hda3 /media/hda3 ext3 defaults 0 2
[10:32] <lordmaynoth2> i used the word Backup instead of hda3
[10:33] <lordmaynoth2> so should it read
[10:33] <opteek> has anyone gotten easyubuntu to work with edgy?
[10:33] <lordmaynoth2> /dev/hda3 /media/Backup ext3 defaults 0 2
[10:33] <lordmaynoth2> ?
[10:33] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: yes, perfect.  Good catch
[10:33] <lordmaynoth2> does it need a # in front of it like the others
[10:33] <opteek> no
[10:34] <opteek> thats a comment out
[10:34] <LjL> opteek: you could try asking in #easyubuntu
[10:34] <limpbizcuit> i just did a fresh reinstall of breezy
[10:34] <dsquare> when u run gparted using sudo gparted, it doesn't ask me for a password. then it starts, but almost all features are greyed out (inactive) do i need to unmount something?
[10:35] <limpbizcuit> and not sure to upgrade to dapper over internet
[10:35] <limpbizcuit> because when i did before the application menus were messed up
[10:35] <jrib> !upgrade | limpbizcuit
[10:35] <ubotu> limpbizcuit: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[10:36] <lordmaynoth2> is there a comma after defaults
[10:36] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: no
[10:36] <lordmaynoth2> kk
[10:36] <lordmaynoth2> does the line below it need "0     0"
[10:36] <lordmaynoth2> like the line above
[10:37] <hercul> test one two
[10:37] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: no, that is probably just wrapping done by your text editor and is actually the same line
[10:37] <lordmaynoth2> ooh
[10:37] <lordmaynoth2> okies
[10:37] <lordmaynoth2> thank you
[10:37] <lordmaynoth2> ok I saved it
[10:37] <lordmaynoth2> what do i do now
[10:37] <lordmaynoth2> ?

[10:37] <ubotu> lordmaynoth2: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.

[10:38] <bXi> is it possible to use a firefox 1.5 plugin in firefox 2?
[10:39] <xavice> Heya, I have completely NO sound. I had sound two days ago. Can anyone help me?
[10:40] <eilker> !alsa
[10:40] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[10:40] <lordmaynoth2> it says wrong fs, bad option, bad superblock

[10:40] <xavice> Yes, they are on.
[10:40] <xavice> They're plugged in.

[10:42] <secleinteer> hi, i'm trying to compile gaim2.0beta5 and i'm getting the error "checking for XML::Parser... configure: error: XML::Parser perl module is required for intltool" from the configure script
[10:42] <secleinteer> does anyone know which package i need to install to resolve this dependency?
[10:43] <jrib> secleinteer: 'sudo apt-get build-dep gaim'

[10:43] <secleinteer> thanks
[10:43] <lordmaynoth2> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35333/
[10:43] <secleinteer> jrib: do i need to remove gaim 1.5.0 first?
[10:43] <jrib> secleinteer: apt-cache search lib xml perl parse  will turn up the package you need, but that command should give it to you as well as other stuff to compile gaim
[10:43] <jrib> secleinteer: you should imo, but not really necessary
[10:44] <secleinteer> ok
[10:44] <secleinteer> thx

[10:46] <dsquare> how can i make my one hard drive not busy so i can partition it? do i need to boot ubuntu from the live cd to do that?
[10:46] <jdhore> how do i drop completely out of X?

[10:47] <lordmaynoth2> I dont think I did
[10:47] <jdhore> ty
[10:47] <mc44> dsquare: you want to make an extra partion so you can install?
[10:48] <dsquare> mc44 thats right so i can install a diff OS
[10:48] <jrib> lordmaynoth2: comment the last line that you just added and try 'sudo mount -a'.  Does it still complain?
[10:48] <mc44> dsquare: ubuntu? Because if so, you can create partitions in the Live CD installer
[10:48] <umista> dsquare, whts on ur busy hard drive?
[10:48] <dsquare> mc44no windows. umista, piles of media mainly.
[10:49] <mc44> dsquare: the windows installer will also let you create partitions
[10:50] <mc44> dsquare: but if you want to do it in ubuntu, you can use gparted
[10:50] <mariano> is there an ubuntu developer irc channel?
[10:50] <dsquare> i tried gparted but it is all deactivated and when i try to unmount my drive it says it cantt because its active

[11:08] <synic> eyalw: you probably want sun's implementation, as it's the latest and greatest.
[11:08] <ailean> eyalw, install sun-java5-jdk and tell me when you've installed it and have installed eclipse
[11:08] <asgilder> I got the mail order cd.

[11:09] <DARKGuy> How do I extract a whole lot of zip files in the same folder? unzip *.zip doesn't work >.<
[11:09] <jerp> asglider, ahh ok,  but that original question is over my ehad, you'll have to wait for someone else.
[11:09] <eyalw> and, what is the difference btwn JRE and JDK?
[11:09] <synic> jovans: gnome 2.16 isn't in dapper.  What else do you want?
[11:09] <jerp> ehad=head
[11:10] <asgilder> Okay.
[11:10] <synic> eyalw: the jdk comes with the compiler and stuff.
[11:10] <ailean> eyalw, JDK lets you develop
[11:10] <jovans> whould be backported?
[11:10] <eyalw> and JRE?
[11:10] <jovans> to dapper?
[11:10] <synic> eyalw: just the VM

[11:10] <synic> eyalw: the jre comes with the jdk
[11:10] <DARKGuy> BackPacker: one by one? isn't there a way to extract them all?
[11:10] <mc44> Crankymonky: hes in -offtopic
[11:11] <ailean> eyalw, the jre lets you do some stuff, but the jdk is what you want
[11:11] <BackPacker> DARKGuy: oh, I get your question now. You need to do it in a loop
[11:11] <Crankymonky> mc44, I thought I was in -offtopic:P

[11:12] <ailean> asgilder, what do you need to ask?
[11:12] <vader> asgilder, enjoy :)
[11:12] <BackPacker> DARKGuy: you need to adapt that if any of the zip files contain directory structures: just add this to the end: -d
[11:12] <meuserj> DARKGuy, err... I mean for file in *.zip;do unzip $file;done
[11:12] <asgilder> Just general "You might find this useful" kind of stuff.
[11:12] <ailean> asgilder, have you read the FAQ?
[11:12] <BackPacker> DARKGuy: meuserj's way is better. Far less typing
[11:13] <ailean> asgilder, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions
[11:13] <DARKGuy> Ah, that worked meuserj, but you all gave lots of ideas, thanks all :)
[11:13] <davissean> hey i've got a problem with the buttons in the apps look real spotty
[11:13] <mcphail> BackPacker: yes, but your way will work if there are spaces in the filename, no?

[11:14] <Automorphism> hi
[11:14] <BackPacker> mcphail: oh, hang on... might defeat shell expansion
[11:15] <davissean> and how do i deal with partitions on an ibm thinkpad?
[11:15] <mcphail> BackPacker: i know your way is the only way which works through bitter experience :)
[11:17] <lifepositive> davissean: same as in any system
[11:18] <BackPacker> mcphail: I just tried it with two files called "zip one.zip" and "zip two.zip" and it worked...
[11:18] <DARKGuy> nice

[11:19] <meuserj> where ^]  is what you get when you type ctrl-v ctrl-] 
[11:19] <kandinski> this is weird
[11:19] <asgilder> Can anyone tell me what steps I need to go through to install linux from the cd?
[11:19] <meuserj> BackPacker, err.. there should be single quotes in IFS='^] '
[11:19] <bmc> how come flash doesnt work in opera and crashes firefox?
[11:19] <kandinski> running ubuntu edgy, I have to compile the nvidia driver every time I reboot
[11:20] <cafuego_> meuserj: just quote "$file"
[11:20] <asgilder> I have Ubuntu 6.06
[11:20] <kandinski> it works all right, but when I restart I can't modprobe nvidia
[11:20] <Hoag> asgilder: If you mean the Live CD, make sure your computer is set to boot from the CD
[11:20] <bmc> anyone know how to get flash working in firefox and opera?
[11:20] <asgilder> It is.
[11:20] <cafuego_> file file in *zip; do unzip "$file"; done
[11:20] <kandinski> I recompile, and everything gos all right till the next time.
[11:20] <meuserj> cafuego, won't work... because it divides the spaces up into seperate names... because the space is in the default IFS.
[11:20] <Hoag> asgilder: Then when you boot into Live, there's an icon on the desktop.
[11:20] <BackPacker> meuserj: ok
[11:20] <kandinski> it is 1.0-9631, in case  it matters
[11:20] <kandinski> does anybody know what can it be?
[11:21] <asgilder> I can't boot into Live.
[11:21] <davissean> life i already installed ubuntu but i only have less than half the hard drive space
[11:21] <asgilder> Is there an alternate method?
[11:21] <bmc> why wont flash work?
[11:21] <alek66> How do i make for my laptop to run cooler?is it a video device thing?
[11:21] <cafuego_> meuserj: Not if you do my simple for loop
[11:21] <mc44> bmc: because flash is closed source, and opera is closed source
[11:21] <Hoag> asgilder: Did you burn your own CD, or get some from Ship-it?
[11:21] <asgilder> Ship-it.
[11:21] <asdfr> help! flash 9 hasn't worked ever since I upgraded to edgy & FF2
[11:21] <con-man> are any repositories needed for TwinView and Xinerama?
[11:21] <bmc> i installed flash in opera and firefox, and it wont work in either
[11:22] <bmc> firefox now crashes every time i come to a page with flash
[11:22] <mc44> bmc: did you try flash 9 ?
[11:22] <bmc> so i had to get rid of the flash plugin
[11:22] <bmc> i think so
[11:22] <bmc> ill try again
[11:22] <davissean> i tried to erase the whole hard drive, and install linux but it didn't work like i thought on this ibm hd
[11:22] <bmc> oh no, it was 7
[11:22] <con-man> anyone?
[11:22] <asdfr> I have to use mozilla (ie not firefox) to get the plugin to work correctly

[11:22] <sun_> hi whats the easiest way to capture from firewire digital movie camera and burn to standard dvd (dont need much editing etc)
[11:22] <Hoag> asgilder: If you're sure your computer is set to boot from the CD, I read somewhere that you may have to disable booting from the HD aswell. That's about as far as my knowledge about it goes though.
[11:23] <asgilder> Okay.
[11:23] <BackPacker> meuserj: I just created two zip files with spaces in their names and unzipped them with this: for file in "*.zip";do unzip "$file";done

[11:23] <asdfr> mc44, in fact I was using flash 9 fine until the edgy upgrade borked it
[11:23] <con-man> call your hardware vendor

[11:23] <Hoag> asgilder Good luck. :)
[11:24] <meuserj> BackPacker, ah, didn't think of that.. the quotes defeat the shell expansion
[11:24] <alek66> con-man, why?
[11:24] <varon> hi! can you tell me the order what print out how many cpu's are installed?
[11:24] <BackPacker> meuserj: yes, but you need both sets of quotes. That's what I missed out earlier
[11:24] <asgilder> thanks
[11:24] <cafuego_> alek66: Seriously though, see if the cpu frequency monitor can lower the cpu speed.
[11:24] <cafuego_> BackPacker: Nope, just the second set, no need to quote "*.zip"
[11:24] <meuserj> BackPacker, well.. that simplifies my day-to-day scripts quite a bit...
[11:24] <con-man> alek66: because. its an OS.  temperature problems are due to insufficient cooling inside the case
[11:25] <asdfr> bmc, how long has yours been playing up?
[11:25] <BackPacker> meuserj: oh, ok. Didn't try it that way
[11:25] <sun_> hi whats the easiest way to capture from firewire digital movie camera and burn to standard dvd (dont need much editing etc)

[11:25] <bmc> nice, i just got it working
[11:25] <BackPacker> cafuego_: true... very true...  :-)
[11:25] <bmc> is there any way to get it working with opera?

[11:29] <BackPacker> engla: that's where you can run stuff at the end of the boot sequence and before login
[11:29] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Wiseguy about build-essential | Wiseguy, see the private message from Ubotu
[11:30] <Hoag> BackPacker: No worries. It at least implies it's possible, which is a comfort. :P
[11:30] <asgilder> Anyone know what the hell that means?
[11:30] <BackPacker> Hoag: it implies it's possible ***in KDE*** , at least :-)

[11:42] <BackPacker> ismail: you can't use Suse repositories with ubuntu, no
[11:42] <archangelpetro> no one?
[11:42] <LjL> mirak: yeah, i did it by adding this line to my /etc/inittab:      T0:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 115200 vt100
[11:42] <archangelpetro> how do i read the temperature of my CPU from linux? is it  a part of /dev/..?

[11:43] <archangelpetro> AWOSDev, somewhere? :P
[11:43] <LjL> mirak: though Edgy doesn't have /etc/inittab... that could be an issue ;-) you'd have to read about upstart i suppose
[11:43] <mirak> T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 9600 vt100
[11:43] <mirak> there a commented in /etc/inittab
[11:43] <BackPacker> ismail: you could use debian repositories, but you risk system inconsistencies
[11:43] <mwe> archangelpetro: it's not in /dev. gkrellm works for me
[11:43] <AWOSDev> archangelpetro yeah somewhere :)  I have no working computers that have temperature sensors

[11:47] <newbuntu> hello
[11:47] <mtyhome> hi
[11:47] <ailean> Cotrat, what are you on about?
[11:47] <soundray> ismail: try to retrieve it from the Google cache
[11:47] <HumanPrototype> who would I speak to to ask complicated questions about ubiquity?
[11:47] <mtyhome> does snort iniline require a bridge or it works also on routers?
[11:47] <eltese> con-man, soon, hopefully =)
[11:47] <ailean> HumanPrototype, what is your question?
[11:47] <Royito> yes

[11:48] <con-man> eltese: how does the cube work with dual monitors?
[11:48] <newbuntu> can anyone tell me why my ati video card shows my desktop perfectly on my TV, but when I run a movie in xine or vlc the movie window on the TV is always black... I can only open a movie that plays on my TV with firefox
[11:48] <BackPacker> Royito: do you mean, yes you'd like it translated?
=== CarlF is now known as CarlF1
[11:48] <newbuntu> and not mplayer by itself
[11:48] <Royito> the path its home/roy/Desktop/Slaer en vivo!!.avi
[11:48] <BackPacker> Royito: or are you saying 'yes' to someone else?
[11:48] <HumanPrototype> ailean, I am editing the xubuntu edgy install cd to make a thinclient and want to change ubiquity so it just creates a user called "user" rather than asking
[11:48] <con-man> eltese: is it the same cube on both monitors, but you can rotate them independantly
[11:48] <mtyhome> nobody?
[11:48] <con-man> eltese: or is it two diff cubes (8 desktops)
[11:48] <piggyg1> Roytio: try rebooting your computer and then trying the command again
[11:49] <ailean> HumanPrototype, try jonathan riddell
[11:49] <Royito> please too backpaker sorry i didnt saw you
[11:49] <ailean> HumanPrototype, aka Riddell,
[11:49] <HumanPrototype> ailean, thanks :D
[11:49] <mc44> HumanPrototype: for ubiquity talk to cjwatson
[11:49] <BackPacker> Royito: rm: no se puede borrar `en': No existe el fichero  directorio - "rm: cannot erase 'en': File or directory doesn't exist
[11:50] <HumanPrototype> Riddell, Hi - ailean has recommended I talk to you about altering ubiquity
[11:50] <ailean> HumanPrototype, ok, you're prob more likely to get an answer from cjwatson too. he's in #ubuntu-devel
[11:50] <HumanPrototype> mc44, thanks :D
=== CarlF1 is now known as CarlFK
[11:51] <Royito> see piggygl backpaker got the translation "rm: cannot erase 'en': File or directory doesn't exist"
