[12:01] <progesterone> thanz cursor
[12:01] <skiab0x> I installed ubuntu to an external usb hdd and when I am trying to run it I get the following message : /bin/sh : can't access tty;job control turned of
[12:01] <grimace> curs0r: cheers - as it happens I'm a step ahead and have already installed it and got drives sharing ok
[12:01] <Voltzz> why do my network tools not work? I ping something, 100% loss, and everything else takes an insane time to do whatever its doing but does nothing, and I can't stop it =|
[12:02] <Curs0r> grimace, it shares with winXP fine for me, but not my xbox grrr
[12:02] <Valmarko> is it safe to use easyubuntu?
[12:02] <Voltzz> whois works though
[12:02] <grimace> I see a print$ share too... but now I'm a bit lost
[12:02] <progesterone> i finished server installation ... and when i rebooted, GRUB was loading ... and then reboot again.
=== botxj is now known as borg
[12:02] <Voltzz> NVM
[12:03] <progesterone> ( GRUB loading ... reboot ) it's looping
[12:03] <Valmarko> is it safe to use easyubuntu?
[12:03] <kenz`jazza> mine wont even load after reboot
[12:03] <Curs0r> progesterone, before you select a boot option in grub you have the option of editing the boot config
[12:04] <danielmarsom> checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[12:04] <danielmarsom> could somone help with this?
[12:04] <progesterone> cursor >> could you give me the link so i can read about it?
[12:05] <bimberi> danielmarsom: install build-essential
[12:05] <un_operateur1> danielmarsom, are you building something or compiling your own code?
[12:05] <danielmarsom> biulding.
[12:05] <drivera90> After about ten minutes of use, I think I broke my Ubuntu.
[12:05] <drivera90> :(
[12:05] <un_operateur1> danielmarsom, what bimberi said
[12:05] <un_operateur1> !build-essential
[12:06] <danielmarsom> bimberi: thanks.  that was something i neglected to do..
[12:06] <drivera90> Everything refuses to open. It all goes "Starting [something] ..." and then doesn't open.
[12:06] <dredhammer> is there a deb for vlc 0.8.6?
[12:07] <un_operateur1> http://uk.archive.ubuntu.com feisty/universe vlc 0.8.6.release-0ubuntu1
[12:08] <un_operateur1> dredhammer, should be in the universe repository
[12:08] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, what did you do, exactly?
[12:09] <drivera90> Nothing. I was just sitting around chatting, went to YouTube, that lead me to Adobe Flash Player download center, that lead me to downloading a .tar.gz thing for Flash.
[12:09] <progesterone> hi cursor
[12:09] <drivera90> Upon downloading that, everything refused to work.
[12:09] <dredhammer> ok thank you
[12:10] <kimitaka> server too busy to list channels, anyone know of a Ubuntu PPC channel?
[12:10] <drivera90> I suspect I clicked on "Open with Archive Manager" rather than "Save to disk", but I don't know why would that destroy the world.
[12:10] <Curs0r> progesterone, it's probably better if you boot off the live cd and edit your boot config
[12:10] <dredhammer> thank you un_operateur1
[12:10] <un_operateur1> dred, yw :)
[12:10] <Curs0r> progesterone, http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Loading-an-operating-system-directly is the grub manual section for editing
[12:10] <skiab0x> I installed ubuntu to an external usb hdd and when I am trying to run it I get the following message : /bin/sh : can't access tty;job control turned of
[12:10] <skiab0x> any ideas guys?
[12:11] <Curs0r> progesterone, wait that link was for someone else
[12:12] <wasp_ems> is there a program u can make videos and take photos using your webcam?
[12:12] <Curs0r> progesterone, what you need to do basically is boot from the livecd, mount your ubuntu partition in any temp directory.
[12:12] <drivera90> Thoughts, nolimitsoya?
[12:13] <akk> Is there an easy fix for the 'ugly fonts in edgy" or "bitstream vera fonts don't show up" problems? I see tons of bug reports but no fix.
[12:13] <Curs0r> after that edit tempmount/boot/grub/menu.lst
[12:13] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, save your work and press ctrl+alt+backspace. flash is installed with 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree' in a terminal, provided you have backports repo enabled
[12:13] <wasp_ems> anyone?
[12:13] <meetagee1> Does anybody know what's going on when you can hear sound, but don't get video, using Firefox with Dapper on website such as Foxnews.com?
[12:14] <jrib> meetagee1: no codecs
[12:14] <Curs0r> progesterone, just look into tempmount/boot folder for the names o the kernel and initrd for the grub menu
[12:14] <drivera90> Is there a way to get the normal fonts?
[12:14] <progesterone> cursor >> mount your ubuntu partition in any temp directory ... what for?
[12:14] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, normal?
[12:15] <drivera90> Like... Windows fonts.
[12:15] <Curs0r> progesterone, to gain access to your /boot/grub folder
[12:15] <meetagee1> Hmm! What do I have to install?
[12:15] <drivera90> Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial, what have you.
[12:15] <hjmills> night all
[12:15] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, yes, you can install the tahome font if you own a windows license. its messy though, and then again, why would you? just get used to the new and improved, better fonts. ;) you can still get times new roman for web by installing msttcorefonts
[12:15] <user123> how can I boot from 2 hard disk with different system?
[12:16] <skiab0x> guys
[12:16] <skiab0x> any hint for me?
[12:16] <akk> drivera90: the msttcorefonts package is supposed to give you those, but it isn't working for me (they're not showing up, nor are lots of other fonts)
[12:16] <bulmer> user123: umm unplug the other after and switch them ?
[12:16] <drivera90> Messy sounds bad. I guess I'll stick to these until I get used to them.
[12:17] <nolimitsoya> akk, thats seems to be a problem of yours specificaly. msttcorefonts works fine here, as for almost every other user
[12:17] <Curs0r> bulmer, rofl
[12:17] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, its just tahoma thats messy, since its not released by microsoft
[12:17] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, the others are a piece of cake, and included in msttcprefonts
[12:17] <progesterone> cursor >> I don't have the liveCD for the version i installed. my liveCD version is 5.10. is that ok?
[12:18] <hanasaki> none of my apps in gnome will do the "tilda" key.. ` is fine... but the shift key wont get the tilda from it.. 1
[12:18] <drivera90> Ah. So, what command do I run to get all that?
[12:18] <akk> nolimitsoya: My main issue is trying to get vera to show up (probably a related problem), and googling and searching the bug system shows I'm not the only one having trouble.
[12:18] <Curs0r> progesterone, well we're just mounting your partition and editing a file so that should be ok
[12:18] <user123> bulmer: is not very pratice but...
[12:18] <bulmer> user123: however for it to be both online, i believe you can via grub, you have to configure grub to point to the second drive
[12:18] <Crescendo> That's really annoying.  "Opening <SERVER>" window pops up on top of "Enter default password" window.
[12:18] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, just as any other softwareinstall: 'sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts'
[12:18] <wasp_ems> can anyone help?
[12:18] <meetagee1> Bye!
[12:18] <Wiseguy> hey guys how can i play a .swf file?
[12:18] <hanasaki> how can i re-enable the tilda key on my keyboard?

[12:19] <hanasaki> what is a h4x?
[12:19] <wasp_ems> nolimitsoya, if anyone can tell me a program that allows you to record videos and take pictures with your webcam
[12:19] <Valmarko> sorry my english. I'm from the land of cames
[12:19] <nolimitsoya> wasp_ems, then ask again. noone is going to scroll back tofind what you asked the first time, and if you didnt get any reply, noone that knew the awnser saw your question
[12:19] <progesterone> cursor >> I'm sorry i don't get what you said.
[12:19] <Curs0r> Valmarko, uname -r

[12:20] <Curs0r> Valmarko, run that in a terminal
[12:20] <Valmarko> ok

[12:20] <PriceChild> !language > PriceChild
[12:20] <Wiseguy> does anyone know how .swf files are played?
[12:20] <skiab0x> I installed ubuntu to an external usb hdd and when I am trying to run it I get the following message : /bin/sh : can't access tty;job control turned of

[12:20] <wasp_ems> nolimitsoya, :) ..so any ideas?
[12:20] <progesterone> cursor >> what did you ask me to do?
[12:21] <Styles> is there any builtin partition editor in the Ubutnu installer that allows me to resize the partitions?
[12:21] <Valmarko> 2.6.17-10-generic
[12:21] <PriceChild> !codecs > PriceChild
[12:21] <nolimitsoya> wasp_ems, nope. cant you camera software handle that?
[12:21] <Curs0r> Valmarko, ok, just making sure
[12:21] <bulmer> skiab0x: you have enabled that on your BIOS to boot from the USB drive?
[12:21] <Wiseguy> nolimitsoya, but with what program?
[12:21] <skiab0x> bulmer : I tried that also
[12:21] <wasp_ems> nolimitsoya, can i install in on linux?
[12:21] <see-g> Styles: yes, there is
[12:21] <nolimitsoya> Wiseguy, what ever you are using
[12:21] <bulmer> skiab0x: and what happened?
[12:21] <lemgn> hi
[12:21] <skiab0x> bulmer : the same
[12:21] <lemgn> i have a problem
[12:21] <nolimitsoya> Wiseguy, flashplayer-nonfree should do it
[12:21] <Styles> see-g, can it resize WinFS/NTFS?
[12:21] <lemgn> i want
[12:21] <user123> so 1-install a system in first disk install in the second and .... which is the method???
[12:22] <lemgn> delete
[12:22] <nolimitsoya> wasp_ems, i have no idea, since i dont know what we are talking about
[12:22] <lemgn> beryl
[12:22] <Valmarko> I already tried all the methods. easyubuntu, support from the web...
[12:22] <nolimitsoya> !cam | wasp_ems, read this
[12:22] <bulmer> skiab0x: i have not read your previous post..same thing happened like what?
[12:22] <Ubotwo> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[12:22] <Valmarko> nothing
[12:22] <see-g> Styles: uhm ... I don't know and to be honest, I didn't trust my data to a 0.x-program but used PartitionMagic instead...
[12:22] <skiab0x> bulmer : I get the same error message
[12:22] <wasp_ems> nolimitsoya, my webcam is installed..i want to take pictures and record videos so i need a program
[12:22] <bulmer> user123: I believe during the install process you have a selection as to which drive you want to install it to
[12:22] <skiab0x> I installed ubuntu to an external usb hdd and when I am trying to run it I get the following message : /bin/sh : can't access tty;job control turned of
[12:22] <Curs0r> Valmarko,  apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[12:23] <Valmarko> ok
[12:23] <nolimitsoya> wasp_ems, well, then use whatever program you normaly use to access the cam, just as i said
[12:23] <hanasaki> any ideas why the tilda wont work on my keyboard in X?  works fine in virutal terminals... in X ... its like the shift key doesnt owrk.. for this one key
=== borg is now known as botxj
[12:23] <bulmer> skiab0x: you get that during install? or thats already after installation and you attempt to boot?
[12:23] <nolimitsoya> hanasaki, youve set your keyboard up wrong in x
[12:23] <user123> bulmer: so I can do after all?
[12:23] <Valmarko> ok
[12:23] <hanasaki> nolimitsoya: how do i set it up?
[12:23] <f00t> Hello
[12:23] <wasp_ems> nolimitsoya, when i install it on windows i have it..should i try installing a windows cd on linux?
[12:23] <see-g> Styles: if I am not mistaken, you can check whether PartEd supports resizing <your partition's filesystem> here: http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/features.shtml
[12:23] <nolimitsoya> hanasaki, run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and set things right
[12:24] <hanasaki> thakns
[12:24] <hanasaki> brb
[12:24] <nolimitsoya> wasp_ems, no
[12:24] <skiab0x> bulmer : after installation
[12:24] <Curs0r> Valmarko, working?
[12:24] <skiab0x> bulmer : when I try to run it for the 1st time
[12:24] <Valmarko> lets see
[12:24] <bulmer> user123: you can try the install proces and watch out at the point where it ask you where you want it installed, and select accordingly
[12:24] <f00t> I can't find what the system requirements are :o
[12:24] <Valmarko> Curs0r, no
=== botxj is now known as borg
[12:25] <Curs0r> Valmarko, huh, weird
[12:25] <kitche> f00t: depends linux doesn't have one set of requirements like window does
[12:25] <f00t> kitche: Depends on what theN?
[12:25] <bulmer> skiab0x: i seem to recall that my cd was bad and I had that experience, so i redownload and re-burn..then re-installed..
[12:25] <dcordes_> i have activated my tv in dualhead mode. i only see a black screen on it and when i go to the corner of my screen my cursor appears as an X. how can i display programs on this dual head thing   now?
[12:25] <Valmarko> If I use mozilla it works. but not with firefox
[12:25] <Curs0r> Valmarko, did you yun the instll with sudo?
[12:25] <Valmarko> yes
[12:25] <skiab0x> bulmer : is there any way
[12:26] <skiab0x> bulmer : I can see if the cd is ok?
[12:26] <Curs0r> was firefox open when you installed?
[12:26] <bruenig> Curs0r, that wouldn't matter
[12:26] <Valmarko> with automatix it will wotk for sure but I dont want to install it since it might corrupt the system
[12:26] <kitche> f00t: what window manager/desktop environment you use but mostly if you have 128 mb of ram linux will run
[12:26] <bruenig> Curs0r, as long as you of course restarted it
[12:26] <Curs0r> bruenig, it might if he didn't restart firefox lol
[12:27] <bruenig> Curs0r, or if he shutdown his computer and didn't turn it back on
[12:27] <JasonHeller> Curs0r, I tried to do what you said but I guess I went to the wrong place and it did a full system reboot, so I waited it out and it said it finished so I restarted the PC and now I get an error right away, nothing works, I had to boot this up from the CD.  Any ideas?
[12:27] <f00t> kitche: Ok, because i have bought a 300mhz MiniPC with 128 mb of ram
[12:27] <Valmarko> Do you think I should use automatix?
[12:27] <bruenig> Valmarko, no
[12:27] <Valmarko> yaaa... thats the problem
[12:27] <bruenig> Valmarko, are you using ubuntu firefox or did you install the firefox from firefox, I know there are some scripts that do that and quite a few people do it
[12:27] <Valmarko> then... what method should I use to make Firefox work 100%?
=== nightless|afk is now known as nightless
[12:28] <Valmarko> Firefox came with Ubuntu (edgy)

[12:28] <Larus> does anyone know the syntax for installing alsa?
[12:28] <Larus> all alsa?
[12:28] <f00t> kirche: Hmm thank you, thats a shame because i am a complete linux noob, and i've tried Ubuntu on my desktop and i loved it right away :D
[12:29] <bruenig> Valmarko, do ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins, there should be a libflashplayer.so in there
[12:29] <Valmarko> ok
[12:29] <bulmer> skiab0x: i just redid it ..in chance that i had a bad cd..and I did..so redownloading and reburning helped
[12:29] <Valmarko> lot of things :)
[12:29] <nolimitsoya> f00t, you might want to have a look at xubuntu, or use gnome but make a cli install and just apt-get gnome-core to cut down on memoryusage
[12:29] <bruenig> Valmarko, or more accurately a symbolic link to libflashplayer.so
[12:29] <Larus> I was told by the Wine people that I need to install Alsa
[12:29] <Larus> but I don't know how
[12:29] <Larus> or know the syntax
[12:30] <Larus> (command)
[12:30] <nolimitsoya> Larus, alsa is already installed
[12:30] <bruenig> Valmarko, so was libflashplayer.so in there
[12:30] <zylche> You're better talking to the Whisky People, or at least buying them more whisky.

[12:34] <shwag> I upgraded from dapper to edgy, and now my left mouse has major issues. most things I cant click on or select.
[12:34] <bruenig> Valmarko, or actually there is one more than that, ls /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
[12:34] <kitche> hanasaki, gtkpod
[12:34] <nolimitsoya> !palm > hanasaki
[12:34] <vanberge> hanasaki, rythmbox
[12:34] <amonkey> apache seems to be ignoring my .htaccess file, is there a setting to get it to listen? or what is the proper place to put it?
[12:34] <nolimitsoya> hanasaki, see message from ubotwo :)
[12:34] <hanasaki> thanks
[12:34] <Valmarko> ok
[12:34] <bimberi> !ipod
[12:34] <Ubotwo> For information on how to sync and add tracks to your iPod, see the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto
[12:35] <hanasaki> rythbox does ipodnanono? hmm
[12:35] <sorush20> how do I do a sumcheck for a downloaded iso where is the reference sum check
[12:35] <bh__> kitche, how about a sha1 hash ?
[12:35] <jevangelo> why does firefox randomly exit when java is summoned
[12:35] <see-g> bh__: AFAIK it's mostly a client-side problem with lots of different causes ... that happened to me as well, I wondered why I've been unable to install from the alternate CD until I tried the "Check disc for errors"-boot option, which returned a "disc might be damaged"
[12:35] <ady> lol how do i make the screen change size?
[12:35] <amonkey> sorush20, md5sum
[12:35] <see-g> downloading it again solved the issue for me
[12:35] <bimberi> sorush20: on the download page - eg. http://releases.ubuntu.com/edgy/
[12:35] <bruenig> sorush20, the reference sum check would probably be in the same index as where you got the iso. To find md5sum of something do "md5sum whatever.iso"
[12:35] <Valmarko> bruenig, No
[12:35] <Valmarko> I cant see it
[12:35] <bruenig> Valmarko, you are saying that flash works in one of your browsers?
[12:35] <bh__> see-g, I doesn't really get much farther than the boot menuc
[12:36] <kitche> bh_: it's sha1sum instead of md5sum
[12:36] <hanasaki> hmm how do i get the stuff out of rhythmbox into the ipod?
[12:36] <bruenig> Valmarko, what browser does flash work in?
[12:36] <bh__> kitche, did you want me to post the sum here ?
[12:36] <Valmarko> Well, it worked in the last instalation :) But firefox didnt recognize flas at that time
[12:36] <see-g> oh, and a little hint: the Firefox download manager seems to have problems with large files, some friends of mine reported issues with broken files downloaded with Firefox as well (though this has been from pre-1.5-ages; that might be fixed with 1.5.x- or 2.x-releases)
[12:36] <Valmarko> Mozilla
[12:37] <Valmarko> Only mozilla
[12:37] <willskills> no, works in firefox
[12:37] <gozaru> I want to compile strigi; it says it needs some MAGIC vars to be set. Any suggestions?
[12:37] <mike_>  I keep getting asked for a 'passphrase " for wireless?
[12:37] <mike_>  only since updates
[12:37] <kitche> bh__: you download the sum file then run sha1sum on the file and it should say id it's complete or not
[12:37] <bruenig> Valmarko, open a fresh terminal and do this: wget http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/pool/edgy/3v1n0/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.78-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.78-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb
[12:37] <Valmarko> ok
[12:38] <drivera90> Is there anything I can download that has all codecs I'll ever need for video/audio?
[12:38] <akk> I got rid of the ugly fonts, by uninstalling gsfonts-x11. But it still can't find vera or any of the msttcorefonts.
[12:38] <Valmarko> let's see
[12:39] <Valmarko> strange... should I use dapper instead ?
[12:39] <bruenig> Valmarko, what happened when you did that?
[12:40] <drivera90> What's Valmarko trying to do?
[12:40] <Valmarko> Confirmations... I accepted. But it doesnt do anything infirefox

[12:40] <bruenig> Valmarko, ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[12:40] <Valmarko> ok
[12:40] <A-L-A-R-M> how can i set firefox as my default browser ? when i click on a link konqueror opens automatically
[12:41] <Valmarko> yes . its there
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> Valmarko, if youre struggling with flash, have you checked if backports is enabled and just tried to apt-get flashplugin-nonfree?
[12:41] <sorush20> is the sumcheck of and iso is current then should I cd check be right tooo
[12:41] <Valmarko> backports?
[12:41] <bh__> kitche, the md5sum is correct
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> !backports | Valmarko
[12:42] <Ubotwo> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[12:42] <Flannel> bh__: what speed did you burn at?
[12:42] <bruenig> A-L-A-R-M, sudo update-alternatives --set x-www-browser /usr/bin/firefox
[12:42] <bh__> Flannel, 4 this time around
[12:42] <Valmarko> ok
[12:42] <A-L-A-R-M> i wonder where u all learn those commands :)
[12:42] <bh__> Flannel, also, I'm getting seek errors regarding the length of the media
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> Valmarko, enable that repo, and do: 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree' and youre troubles willmost likely be solved :)
[12:42] <bh__> This should be able to hold the size of the ISO pretty closely the limit
[12:43] <Valmarko> tanks all
[12:43] <bruenig> A-L-A-R-M, I actually just learned that. I had to switch mine back because for whatever reason it kept wanting to open in a text browser
[12:43] <drivera90> Man. msttcorefonts is taking so long.
[12:43] <bh__> Flannel, any suggestions ?
[12:43] <tgelter> greetings. is it possible to add something to the menu corresponding to a right-click on the gnome desktop?
[12:43] <vanberge> drivera90, what are those?  microsoft fonts?
[12:43] <A-L-A-R-M> thanks
[12:43] <nolimitsoya> vanberge, yes
[12:43] <drivera90> Yeah.
[12:44] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, crtl+c kills a process, if you want to start over
[12:44] <vanberge> nolimitsoya, what does that benefit exactly.. . one of my friends told me to install them
[12:44] <GigaClon> There is this one website that works fine with Firefox 2 in windows but when I view it in Linux with FF2 its all slow responding when I scroll
[12:44] <drivera90> Nah, it's all going fine, just downloading at 5.5kbps.
[12:44] <nolimitsoya> vanberge, it makes sure you can view documents the way the author intended, fex, if the document was written using microsoft fonts
[12:45] <vanberge> nolimitsoya, ahh.. good point.  tyvm.
[12:45] <nolimitsoya> GigaClon, most likely a flash issue.
[12:45] <vanberge> nolimitsoya, so not a bad idea to install them
[12:45] <nolimitsoya> vanberge, not at all :)
[12:45] <vanberge> can you just apt-get them?
[12:45] <koss_owl> Hey Everybody, I have just about had it with Windowz XP and I am thinking of switching, I have a celeron system @ 874mhz with 321 megs of ram, is this enough for a linux system that I plan to watch movieson, program a little and play with Office software?
[12:45] <nolimitsoya> vanberge, yes, provided you have the right repo enabled
[12:46] <nolimitsoya> !msttcorefonts | vanberge
[12:46] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[12:46] <vanberge> nolimitsoya, i have universe/multiverse
[12:46] <nolimitsoya> vanberge, then try it :)
[12:46] <nolimitsoya> stupid bot... why is package searching down?
[12:46] <TGPO> koss_owl: yup, not all at the same time though
[12:46] <GigaClon> nolimitsoya, there doesn't seem to be any flash just PHP
[12:46] <kitche> nolimitsoya,  Ubotwo never had package searching
[12:47] <nolimitsoya> GigaClon, then i dont knowwhy :) could be related toplugins, etx
[12:47] <nolimitsoya> kitche, but ubotu did :) what happend to him?
[12:47] <bh__> kitche, any suggestions ?
[12:47] <kitche> nolimitsoya: probably having problems that's when Ubotwo comes in usually
[12:47] <akk> Maybe these font problems have something to do with:
[12:48] <akk> Use of uninitialized value in print at /var/lib/defoma/scripts/gs.defoma line 108.
[12:48] <akk> every time I try to aptitude install or uninstall a font package?
[12:48] <Valmarko> good news :)
[12:48] <Valmarko> it works
[12:48] <kitche> bh__: well if the md5sum is ok then it's probably a bad burn or something
[12:48] <akk> Also: opendir: No such file or directory
[12:48] <Valmarko> What was the problem?
[12:48] <koss_owl> TGPO, thought so, what about virus protection and firewall support, that's one of the reasons I am switching.
[12:48] <nolimitsoya> Valmarko, good :) remember to check through the repos noext time, so at not to wase a hour or two struggling in vain ;)
[12:49] <dibblego> is there a way for me type type "forallTAB" so that I can have the character ? i.e. can I set up a way of typing my own special characters?
=== DreamThief is now known as DreamThief|off
[12:49] <nolimitsoya> !virus | koss_owl
[12:49] <Ubotwo> A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[12:49] <vanberge> nolimitsoya, lol these fonts are taking longer than beryl took to apt-get.  :-)
[12:49] <Valmarko> sorry. I'm just doing my first steps in ubuntu
[12:49] <Valmarko> thanks
[12:50] <nolimitsoya> vanberge, they have to be downloaded from a third party, and that third party seems to be slow at the moment. there was just a guy here, complaining about the very same problem
[12:50] <kitche> koss_owl: there really isn't A/V software for linux there is a firewall that is good called iptables which really is the only firewall that you will really use if you can configure it right
[12:50] <FirstStrike> anyone running edgy?
[12:50] <vanberge> no biggie... i'm patient.  :-)
[12:50] <A-L-A-R-M> another question. although some services are marked to start at boot (like acpid,anacron and so on) , their status is "not running" why is that ?
[12:50] <vanberge> FirstStrike,  yes  :-)
[12:50] <drivera90> All done now, though.
[12:50] <FirstStrike> vanberge: did you upgrade from dapper?
[12:50] <nolimitsoya> koss_owl, if you dont want to fiddle with iptables manualy firestarter will have you set up in no time
[12:50] <FirstStrike> or is it a fresh intall?
[12:51] <FirstStrike> install*
[12:51] <drivera90> Took maybe ten, fifteen minutes.
[12:51] <vanberge> FirstStrike,  on my laptop yes... on my pc no, it was a frewh install
[12:51] <FirstStrike> mm
[12:51] <vanberge> frewh = fresh
[12:51] <FirstStrike> i'm thinking about upgrading, so i'm interested in hearing from some people that did a dapper > edgy upgrade to see how smooth it's been in comparison to dapper.
[12:52] <FirstStrike> or if they've had problems
[12:52] <kitche> A-L-A-R-M, anacron from what I get from it's name will only run when there is a job that needs running
[12:52] <vanberge> FirstStrike, on my laptop... all i had to do is remove/re-install ndiswrapper to get my wireless to work.
[12:52] <Saturnus-irc> Is there a shell command that only outputs the current folder and not the complete path?
[12:52] <vanberge> other than that, the upgrade was easy and awesome
[12:52] <nolimitsoya> FirstStrike, edgy is quite stable, but upgrading has coused problems in the past. try the live cd first and make sure you dont run into any regression bugs
[12:52] <FirstStrike> is it really worth the upgrade overall?
[12:53] <vanberge> FirstStrike, you just have to do update-manager -c and its all automated.
[12:53] <Flannel> Saturnus-irc: why would you want that?
[12:53] <FirstStrike> my dapper is stable, but are the edgy features worth it?
[12:53] <nolimitsoya> FirstStrike, imo, yes, but that depends on your needs and deployment environment
[12:53] <koss_owl> Thanks Ubotwo for the link, a good read.
[12:53] <A-L-A-R-M> kitche: there also many other services that are like that hotkeysetup,rsync and so on
[12:53] <FirstStrike> it's just a home desktop
[12:53] <Saturnus-irc> Flannel: I'm customizing bash (ps1) and don't want the complete path.
[12:53] <nolimitsoya> koss_owl, ubotwo is a bot. i sent you that link ;)
[12:54] <dibblego> A-L-A-R-M, do hotkey services allow me to type "forallTAB" so that I can have the character ? i.e. can I set up a way of typing my own special characters?
[12:54] <stefg> FirstStrike: errrmm... IMHO for the amount of trouble edgy causes, a well running dapper should not be dismissed
[12:54] <Flannel> Saturnus-irc: that seems... dangerous.  You could just use a regexp and strip out the previous stuff, I suppose
[12:54] <kitche> A-L-A-R-M, yeah rsync is a daemon used for mirroring and such
[12:54] <FirstStrike> alright
[12:54] <A-L-A-R-M> dibblego:  my question is why dont they start if it is set to for them to start at boot
[12:54] <Saturnus-irc> Thanks, Flannel. Gonna have to read some regexp first then. ;)
[12:55] <koss_owl> Thanks kitche, I am looking it up on wikipedia right now and reading up on it.
[12:55] <A-L-A-R-M> there is also kde-guidance for example
[12:55] <dibblego> they probably started only when required
[12:55] <un_operateur1> Saturnus-irc, can you give us an example
[12:55] <un_operateur1> ?
[12:55] <A-L-A-R-M> i see
[12:55] <nolimitsoya> koss_owl, as i said, you dont have to :) did you see my messages?
[12:55] <un_operateur1> outputs the current folder and not the complete path??  maybe  -- basename `pwd`  ??
[12:55] <shwag> I upgraded from dapper to edgy, and now my left mouse has major issues. most things I cant click on or select.  Anyone have any ideas ? Where I might start ?
[12:56] <shwag> What would mess up my left click, but leave the most working for the most part?  GTK ?
[12:56] <A-L-A-R-M> something else. although i removed from the package manager mythtv succesfully i still see in the services mythtv-backend , why isnt that removed ? how can i completely remove safely everything that is left behind
[12:56] <koss_owl> All I want to do is program a little(Python/C/C++) browse with firefox and download and watch movies with utorrent and play with Excel files.
[12:57] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: because mythtv is probably a meta package.  It depends on a lot of stuff (so they get installed), then when you remove the main package, it won't remove the dependencies
[12:57] <ubuntu> hey i need help i get a black screen after the first progress bar appears and finishes
[12:57] <koss_owl> nolimitsoya, Sorry I didn't realize that at the time, I apoligize.
[12:58] <ubuntu> if anyone knows please help me
[12:58] <A-L-A-R-M> well i removed all the packages that i installed that needed for mythtv
[12:58] <bh__> kitche, I'm getting an "Illegal Length Indication" error when I verify reading the entire image against /dev/hdc directly
[12:58] <koss_owl> nolimitsoya, I did not, can you send it again? Thanks.
[12:58] <nolimitsoya> koss_owl, no problem :) to repeat it, there is clamav if you need av, but its not neccesary, and theres firestarter to set up iptables
[12:58] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: oh, sorry.  Did you "remove" or "remove completely"?

[12:59] <bh__> Is there a minimalist Ubuntu installation disk ?

[12:59] <koss_owl> nolimitsoya, I already read that, mixed up for a sec, thanks again.
[12:59] <Flannel> bh__: do you want a minimal install? or a small disk download?
[12:59] <ubuntu> i have a celeron at 564 MHZ
[12:59] <nolimitsoya> bh__, depends on what you mean... there is the alternate install :)
[12:59] <bh__> Flannel, small disk downloa
[01:00] <A-L-A-R-M> remove the package from the adapt manager . and all the other packages that were needed
[01:00] <Flannel> bh__: well, theres a 8mb disk, but then it downloads the packages as it installs, from the web.
[01:00] <bh__> nolimitsoya, they both seem to be large images from a download standpoint
[01:00] <koss_owl> ubuntu, and you don't have any problems running ubuntu?
[01:00] <bh__> Flannel, yeah, where ?
[01:00] <nolimitsoya> bh__, ah, yes. there are no smaller im afraid

[01:01] <nolimitsoya> bh__, thatd be the onw Flannel is linking :)
[01:01] <mnoir> nolimitsoya: that link is plain wrong - the last sentence on that page even says so
[01:01] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: you'll want to... um, I don't know what it's called, you might want to askin #kubuntu, ask what the equivalent of apt-get remove --purge is in adept
[01:01] <usr_rob> to add this:  "auth optional pam_keyring.so try_first_pass session optional pam_keyring.so" in "/etc/pam.d/gdm" will use my account password.
[01:01] <ubuntu> or i could pm u
[01:01] <nolimitsoya> mnoir, what link?
[01:01] <usr_rob> if my girlfriend login with her account, which not have the same password as mine, she will prompt to write the keyringpassword which is the same as my user account's.
[01:01] <ronnet> Which codecs do I install to get video to work, when using Firefox with Dapper?
[01:01] <mnoir> the bogus link about virii in linux
[01:01] <usr_rob> i'm not sure how to fix this, so that the keyring password will be unlocked no matter of which user that will login.
[01:01] <ubuntu> if anyon knows how to help me please say so or pm me
[01:01] <A-L-A-R-M> okie thanks
[01:01] <usr_rob> suggestions ?

[01:04] <bimberi> ubuntu: that's not enough RAM to run the LiveCD (min is 256MB)
[01:04] <stefg> ubuntu, 64 mb is not enough for anything but a server install or fluxbuntu
[01:04] <mnoir> nolimitsoya: the use of the word "big" is very unwise.  Without proper AV protection, you can, at least, be the unwitting vector in the spread of viruses.  And fixing something after I have been infected if I didn't have proper protection is not going to do much for me :)
[01:04] <livingtm> I installed a kernel update, and after reboot there was an error "mount: Mounting /dev/md1 on /root failed: No such device" only right above that, i have the message "mdadm: /dev/md1 has been started with 2 drives"
[01:05] <livingtm> how can i fix this and get through a boot?
[01:05] <beibei> can anyone tell me how to install the latest version of GNOMAD2.8.9????
[01:05] <ubuntu> oh so i need to install flexbuntu
[01:05] <nolimitsoya> mnoir, you cant spread viri if you are not infected, and infection is a nonissue for unix platforms at the moment
[01:05] <ubuntu> k thanks

[01:06] <mnoir> nolimitsoya: excuse me.  Somebody sends me an infected email.  I forward it to somebody else.  How is that not spreading it??
[01:06] <cge> Is there any list of concrete problems with using apt-get dist-upgrade as opposed to the update-manager?
[01:06] <bh__> nolimitsoya, much better
[01:06] <synchk> hey all
[01:07] <cge> For upgrading, that is.
[01:07] <nolimitsoya> mnoir, thats what the second message adressed :) that considdered sharing files
[01:07] <nolimitsoya> bh__, what is?
[01:07] <_3oo3> Hey, how can I run SUSE in ubuntu?  plaese and thanks you it for class assignment help very much
[01:07] <synchk> how do you do stack programming in openoffice?
[01:07] <bh__> this mini.iso actually loads and runs the kernel
[01:07] <kitche> cge: you might have a broken system
[01:07] <gizmo_the_great1> Hi. I am trying to work out how to get the 'cp' command to only copy new or modified files to my backup media. According to the man page, the swithc is -u. I have also read that elsewhere that, by default, cp only copies newer or modified files. However, in my case, it continually re-copies the whole lot! The command I am using is 'cp -r -u -v Mounts/ext3/ /media/ieee1394disk' Any ideas?
[01:07] <nolimitsoya> mnoir, regular viri proliferation is not forwarded emails, but worms
[01:08] <mnoir> OK - I guess nobody shares files with Windows users.  Especially when they are beginning to explore a linux system :)
[01:08] <Larus> oh god
[01:08] <Larus> I'm being forced to go to the Aerosmith concert tonight
[01:08] <Larus> stupid girlfriends
[01:08] <bimberi> plural?
[01:08] <nolimitsoya> mnoir, then the windows users are the primary target for a viri protection scheme. you cant dissagree on that one
[01:08] <mnoir> Larus:.. could be Barry Manilow...
[01:08] <stefg> Larus: please suffer in #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:08] <A-L-A-R-M> i think i just delated everything that was in the folder /usr/local/bin with root
[01:08] <nolimitsoya> *-s
[01:08] <AfterDeath> lol girlfriends
[01:08] <A-L-A-R-M> is there any way to see if they are in the trash or something ?
[01:08] <cge> kitche: I'm asking, specfically, for instances besides the lack of ubuntu-desktop being installed that would cause apt-get dist-upgrade to fail. What does update-manager do differently?
[01:08] <_3oo3> how can run SUSE in ubuntu?  plaese and thanks you it for class assignment help very much
[01:09] <synchk> how do you do stack programming in openoffice?
[01:09] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: how did you delete it? rm? or nautilus
[01:09] <A-L-A-R-M> rm
[01:09] <bh__> nolimitsoya, problem here is that the keyboard defaults to dvorak
[01:09] <Ktracho> how do i know what type or architecture is my PC ----------   i386  ---  x86_64  ---   PPC    ?
[01:09] <_3oo3> synchk, stack programming?
[01:09] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, you could use vmware
[01:09] <un_operateur1> SuSe in ubuntu?? wtf?
[01:09] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: then it's gone
[01:09] <synchk> _3oo3: Yeah!
[01:09] <Ktracho> i have a 2.0 Interl P4
[01:09] <AfterDeath> Ktracho: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[01:09] <synchk> _3oo3: Do you know?
[01:09] <A-L-A-R-M> what files where there ?
[01:09] <AfterDeath> if its an intel p4
[01:09] <A-L-A-R-M> i mean could it be that i will restart my computer and nothing will work or what
[01:09] <AfterDeath> it'll be i386
[01:09] <A-L-A-R-M> damn it...
[01:09] <kitche> cge: it makes it easier for usres that don't know how to edit sources.list to point to the right repo to do a distupgrade
[01:09] <Ktracho> ahh ok thanks man
[01:09] <mnoir> nolimitsoya: yes they are a more desirable target.  Agreed.  Makes no difference to the desirability of me protecting my system, whatever the os
[01:10] <bimberi> Ktracho: uname -m
[01:10] <AfterDeath> Ktracho: np
[01:10] <gizmo_the_great1> Anyone here au fai with 'cp'?
[01:10] <synchk> _3oo3: Can you only do Open Object programming with open office?
[01:10] <_3oo3> synchk:  what kind of stack programming do you want to do?  I don't understand your question.  Could you be more articulate?
[01:10] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: nah, just local programs you've installed (not through package manager).  chances are, nothing.  Or at least, very little.
[01:10] <mnoir> gizmo_the_great1: your actual question?
[01:10] <synchk> Well, I have this assignment for my class.
[01:10] <_3oo3> how can run SUSE in ubuntu?  plaese and thanks you it for class assignment help very much  How do make file for suse?!
[01:10] <synchk> I need to do stack programming for it.
[01:10] <synchk> So I figure I'd use Linux?
[01:10] <gizmo_the_great1> mnoir:  I am trying to work out how to get the 'cp' command to only copy new or modified files to my backup media. According to the man page, the swithc is -u. I have also read that elsewhere that, by default, cp only copies newer or modified files. However, in my case, it continually re-copies the whole lot! The command I am using is 'cp -r -u -v Mounts/ext3/ /media/ieee1394disk' Any ideas?
[01:11] <_3oo3> What do you mean by stack programming, synchk?
[01:11] <Flannel> _3oo3: suse is linux, ubuntu is linux.  You can probably run whatever you need Suse for, in ubuntu itself.
[01:11] <cge> kitche: That makes sense. So as long as it is obvious that the user is able to do that, I can just tell them that dist-upgrade will work just as well?
[01:11] <nolimitsoya> mnoir, then you didnt follow me. the linux environment is in a state of viri imunity more or less at the moment. there is nothing toprotect. if you share files with windows client, or dualboot, thats where the protection should be. running clamav on the linux side is most likely redundant
[01:11] <_3oo3> Flannel:  Yes, want run SUSE in ubuntu please
[01:11] <synchk> _3oo3: I'm not sure really, it's just in teh assignemtn.
[01:11] <kitche> cge: as long as they edit the repo if they want to upgrade to a different version of ubuntu
[01:11] <gizmo_the_great1> _3oo3: VMWare Server Console
[01:11] <akk> gizmo_the_great1: You might want to look into rsync instead of cp
[01:12] <stefg> _3oo3: sudo apt-get install vmware-player, then wget http://www.any_suse-vm_google_turned up_with.tgz
[01:12] <A-L-A-R-M> Flannel:  could it be that nothing happend ? check at this.
[01:12] <synchk> gizmo_the_great1: Doesn't VM cost lots of money?
[01:12] <A-L-A-R-M> alarm@rockpc:~/Desktop/rar$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin rar
[01:12] <A-L-A-R-M> rm: cannot remove `/usr/local/bin': Is a directory
[01:12] <_3oo3> gizmo_the_great1:  not understand it
[01:12] <gizmo_the_great1> synchk: no - its free
[01:12] <_3oo3> stefg:  what u mean?
[01:12] <synchk> gizmo_the_great1: I tried to purchase a VM license for Ubuntu but it was a lot.
[01:12] <A-L-A-R-M> did it remove the files in the /bin folder or didnt do anything ?
[01:12] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: yes, nothing happened for you.
[01:12] <kitche> cge: if it's just doing a same version of ubuntu but want to see if there is new packages for that version then a upgrade will work
[01:12] <gizmo_the_great1> _3oo3: what dont u understand?
[01:12] <mnoir> nolimitsoya: no - linux is simply not being attacked much at the moment which is very different from immune.  Ya wanna just wait until you are attacked to start protecting yourself?  I don't
[01:12] <A-L-A-R-M> thank god...
[01:12] <A-L-A-R-M> thank you :)
[01:12] <Flannel> A-L-A-R-M: actually, it mightve removed ~/Desktop/rar, I.... dont actually know if it stops on errors, or just keeps going.
[01:12] <cge> mnoir: Linux *is* being attacked. But most attacks on linux aren't using viruses.
[01:13] <gizmo_the_great1> synchk: I got it free from their website
[01:13] <akk> What is "opendir"? ttf fonts try to use it but I'm getting a lot of opendir: No such file or directory errors
[01:13] <Ktracho> is their a channle for opensuse 10.2 ?
[01:13] <ox> uhmm.. what is the "super" button? as in "Enter  'Super+n' on your keyboard?
[01:13] <synchk> gizmo_the_great1: Uh, I'm not a software pirate, duh.
[01:13] <A-L-A-R-M> well desktop rar exists
[01:13] <kitche> mnoir: anyways A/V software just checks for Window viruses anyways
[01:13] <stefg> _3oo3: to be honest... i was at the edge of bs'ing you... run suse or run ubuntu (far better)... you cant run suse on ubuntu
[01:13] <akk> Oh, maybe it's not opendir that's not found, but some font file it's looking for.
[01:13] <_3oo3> Ktracho, yes, want use suse in ubuntu
[01:13] <mnoir> cge: which is why AV is never enough, just not optional
[01:13] <kitche> synch: the windows key
[01:13] <Ktracho> ahh ok
[01:13] <cge> mnoir: It essentially means that an A/V system is useless right now.
[01:13] <_3oo3> i dont understand
[01:13] <Flannel> _3oo3: you can't run SuSe "in" Ubuntu.  You could install them both on the same machine (and run one or the other).  Then, you can run SuSe in an emulator (in ubuntu), but... why on earth would you want that?
[01:14] <A-L-A-R-M> it concerns me more about the /usr/local/bin folder . the folder exists. but in it there is nothing at all . i wanted to delete the rar executable file. thats why i dont know if there were other files in there as well
[01:14] <synchk> kitche: What windows key?
[01:14] <kitche> synchk: your keyboard doesn't have a windows flag key on it?
[01:14] <synchk> kitche: No...
[01:14] <nolimitsoya> mnoir, much of the nets entire infrastructure is based on unixlike systems, as is chinas whole governmental system. the targets are there, and if it was possible, we would be seeing these attacks already since there is great amounts of prestige towin.
[01:14] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, did you use the command line to delete files from that folder?
[01:14] <_3oo3> Flannel, to construct a potential emulation showing bugs in not only the emulator but the instability of the system being emulated and compare it to being ran on the actual hardware for statistical reasons.
[01:14] <beibei> cge: WHAT DO YOU MAEAN
[01:15] <synchk> kitche: I use a apple.
[01:15] <A-L-A-R-M> well un_operateur1 as u see above yes
[01:15] <con-man> what chmod level gives you total permissions
=== agent_ is now known as agent
[01:15] <_3oo3> how do run suse in ubuntu please?
[01:15] <kitche> synchk: it might be the apple key then
[01:15] <cge> beibei: ?
[01:15] <con-man> what chmod level gives you total permissions
[01:15] <synchk> kitche: i dont have one!!
[01:15] <mnoir> nolimitsoya: If you want to wait for a successful attack prior to protecting yourself, be mt guest :)
[01:15] <kitche> !vmware|_3oo3
[01:15] <con-man> what chmod level gives you total permissions
[01:15] <TGPO> _3oo3: google QEMU
[01:15] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, well, i'm afraid there is no simple recovery -- the files do not get sent to trash
[01:15] <synchk> kitche: I have a ibm model m I use.
[01:15] <mnoir> mt = my :)
[01:15] <Ktracho> Hey i want to download OPENSUSE 10.2 whats the diference between      openSUSE 10.2 Installation Media  ---  openSUSE 10.2 Add On Media  ----  openSUSE 10.2 Installaton Repositories
[01:15] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, are you sure you know what you are doing? anyway, ive already tipped you off on vmware
[01:15] <con-man> what chmod level gives you total permissions
[01:15] <synchk> kitche: So it doens't have a windows key or apple key.
[01:16] <Flannel> con-man: you probably don't want chmod.  What are you trying to do?
[01:16] <_3oo3> what is vmware?
[01:16] <_3oo3> not understand
[01:16] <beibei> cge: what do you mean by: Linux is being attaked but not using viruses
[01:16] <con-man> Flannel: mount something
[01:16] <cafuego> Ktracho: you're soooo on the wrong channel...
[01:16] <_3oo3> is kenya room #ubuntu?
[01:16] <con-man> Flannel: ive got my line is fstab
[01:16] <nolimitsoya> Ktracho, this is the ubuntu support channel
[01:16] <bimberi> _3oo3: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[01:16] <cafuego> Ktracho: that said, you'll want the installation media
[01:16] <con-man> Flannel: im mounting an NTFS partition to a folder in my home directory
[01:16] <synchk> beibei: there aren't any linux viruses out, linux is immune.
[01:16] <un_operateur1> con-man, define total permissions
[01:16] <Flannel> Ktracho: try #SuSe
[01:16] <un_operateur1> :)
[01:16] <Ktracho> thanks
[01:16] <Ktracho> sorry
[01:16] <Flannel> con-man: you can't write to NTFS
[01:16] <_3oo3> bimberi, no understand page what say?
[01:16] <A-L-A-R-M> un_operateur1:  this appeared: alarm@rockpc:~/Desktop/rar$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin rar
[01:16] <A-L-A-R-M> rm: cannot remove `/usr/local/bin': Is a directory
[01:17] <cge> beibei: I mean that attacks on linux generally are done in other ways, like by using bots that try to guess passwords or exploit bugs in older versions of SSH.
[01:17] <A-L-A-R-M> so it means that nothing (maybe was removed)
[01:17] <con-man> Flannel: the how do I just view and copy
[01:17] <jbinder> A-L-A-R-M: rm -rf
[01:17] <Flannel> con-man: you should already be able to do that.
[01:17] <fokuslee> hey stupid question how do i list all the different kernels i have on my computer?
[01:17] <Flannel> !ntfs | con-man
[01:17] <cafuego> A-L-A-R-M: it will have removed a file called 'rar' in the current directory.
[01:17] <TGPO> _3oo3: you have been answered repeatedly
[01:17] <con-man> Flannel: as root I can
[01:17] <Flannel> oh, right.
[01:17] <_3oo3> !suse
[01:17] <Stormx2> I get the impression _3oo3 is in the wrong channel / being facetious
[01:17] <beibei> cge: Cheers
[01:17] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, if that was the command you used -- then /usr/local/bin should still exist
[01:17] <con-man> Flannel: I dont want to sudo everything
[01:17] <cafuego> A-L-A-R-M: What were you trying to delete?
[01:17] <Flannel> con-man: right, let me get you a link, ubotu is down.
[01:17] <_3oo3> storm:  what u mean?
[01:17] <synchk> Stormx2: what?
[01:17] <bimberi> Stormx2: chech the hostmask
[01:17] <bimberi> *check
[01:17] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, you probably wanted   rm /usr/local/bin/rar  instead
[01:18] <cge> beibei: And are often done by individuals actually running the attack against a specific computer they want to control, instead of just putting a virus out on the internet.
[01:18] <_3oo3> what mean this word: facetius
[01:18] <gizmo_the_great1> synchk: neither am i. It's recently been released free for Linux. Visit their website and read for yourself before implying I'm thick please. http://www.vmware.com/products/free_virtualization.html
[01:18] <A-L-A-R-M> cafuego:  i tried to install a rar application
[01:18] <kitche> synchk: then most likely you don't have a super key unless you remap your keyboard to have one, but let me ask someone if the ibm m model has a key that is similar, since I know a few people that have worked with ibm m model keyboards
[01:18] <jbinder> _3oo3: do you speak english?
[01:18] <cafuego> A-L-A-R-M: Yeah.. installed to 'usr/local/bin/rar'?
[01:18] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, why didn't you install through aptitude/synaptic??
[01:18] <_3oo3> jbinder: yes
[01:18] <_3oo3> not so good
[01:18] <A-L-A-R-M> did install it with sudo , but didnt have access as simple user
[01:18] <cafuego> A-L-A-R-M: 'sudo rm /usr/local/bin/rar' then. No spaces in the file path!
[01:18] <synchk> kitche: Okay
[01:18] <A-L-A-R-M> and as they were just 2 files rar and unrar  i tried to remove them manualy
[01:19] <nolimitsoya> cge, clam wouldnt do much good againt that either way, would it? :)
[01:19] <beibei> cge: Linux seems very easy, unfortunatelly there are a few programmes I cannot install just yet
[01:19] <incognito> Hi, quick question does drapper support projecting video feed into a projector?
[01:19] <_3oo3> how do run suse in ubuntu?  how use VMWARE?  What is?
[01:19] <jbinder> _3oo3: facetius means sarcastic, or joking around, kidding
[01:19] <synchk> kitche: There's just a big 'ol hole where my apple should be.
[01:19] <A-L-A-R-M> and now it doesnt work at all, and cant install it either
[01:19] <Stormx2> Eek
[01:19] <nolimitsoya> !vmware > _3oo3
[01:19] <Stormx2> I guess I was wrong
[01:19] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, ok, to see if the files in /usr/local/bin  still exist  --  ls -1 /usr/local/bin | wc -l
[01:19] <nightless_> um.. i did an nvidia-xconfig.. and.. now i can't boot X.  where did it store my backup xconfig?
[01:19] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, check the private message from ubotu
[01:19] <_3oo3> vmware !> _3oo3
[01:19] <Stormx2> I just came in here and I saw two people talking as if this was an SUSE help channel. Thought it was a prank.
[01:19] <kitche> synchk: ok then you have to map one most likely since the person that I asked said there isn't one
[01:19] <cge> nolimitsoya: No
[01:19] <A-L-A-R-M> un_operateur1:  i dont know if there were files before in there...
[01:19] <_3oo3> I have no message from <uboto>
[01:20] <synchk> kitche: oh damnnn
[01:20] <synchk> kitche: should i just install windows to get the key?
[01:20] <fokuslee> hey stupid question how do i list all the different kernels i have on my computer?
[01:20] <cafuego> Stormx2: Yes, we help people not use suse ;-)
[01:20] <cge> nolimitsoya: If you are concerned about such attacks, there *are* programs that are useful against them, like snort
[01:20] <rambo3> what the name of that crap to use windows wifi drivers
[01:20] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, type that command out and tell me what the output is
[01:20] <_3oo3> how do USE suse in UBUNTU though?
[01:20] <un_operateur1> _3oo3, you dont
[01:20] <_3oo3> please is help as due tomorrow?
[01:20] <rambo3> cklick on ubuntu.exe
[01:20] <kitche> synchk: well the key is on the keyboard like the Super key is windows flag key or the apple key
[01:20] <Stormx2> _3oo3: Please check the page you were being linked to.
[01:20] <cafuego> _3oo3: via vmwarel; you can get support for that on vmware.com
[01:20] <_3oo3> what page?
[01:20] <cge> nolimitsoya: Buy something like clamav would be useless, yes.
[01:20] <synchk> kitche: yeah i know! should i install windows?
[01:20] <_3oo3> i dont understand
[01:20] <synchk> kitche: for the windows key?
[01:21] <bimberi> fokuslee: ls /boot/vmlinuz*
[01:21] <_3oo3> someone help?
[01:21] <_3oo3> why no one help
[01:21] <Stormx2> _3oo3: We're trying to help
[01:21] <Stormx2> !vmware | _3oo3
[01:21] <vanberge> lol
[01:21] <cge> s/buy/but
[01:21] <kitche> synchk: an OS has nothing to do with the super key
[01:21] <incognito> quick question, can one do projections from a laptop running ubuntu? ie a video feed into a projector?
[01:21] <jbinder> _3oo3: what is your problem?
[01:21] <nolimitsoya> cge, im just making sure i havent missed some important feature of clam, like idts. just checking to make sure that these kinds of attacks you where talking about was something completely diffrent than what i and the guys whose name i cant remember was discussing :)
[01:21] <synchk> kitche: well how do I use it then... ?
[01:21] <fokuslee> bimberi sweet thx
[01:21] <Stormx2> Hes trying to install VMWare without checking the wiki pages he's been linked to.
[01:21] <bimberi> fokuslee: np :)
[01:21] <nightless_> where are backup xconfig's stored? i nvidia-xconfig'd and it borked X so i need to re-add the other one ?
[01:21] <fokuslee> i used find
[01:21] <_3oo3> jbinder:  need to run suse in ubuntu but cant get to install.  I install one and the other goes away.  Cant install good well.
[01:21] <fokuslee> which is hella stupid
[01:22] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M,   this ought to install rar for you -  sudo aptitude install rar unrar
[01:22] <fokuslee> and gave retarded resutls
[01:22] <Stormx2> _3oo3: You need to use VMWare. Please pay attention :/
[01:22] <TGPO> nightless_: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:22] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, are you - for the second time - sure what you are doing?suse is an opterating system. you dont run operatingsystems within operatingsystems
[01:22] <nightless_> TGPO: thank you
[01:22] <vanberge> _3oo3, there's only one way to do that... virtualization
[01:22] <_3oo3> Storm:  I am paying attention.  Please don't be so mean to me.
[01:22] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: You can run it as a virtual machine
[01:22] <synchk> nolimitsoya: dude! pay attention...
[01:22] <synchk> nolimitsoya: you can pirate vmware and use it
[01:22] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, either way, ive still pointed you towards vmware, and even given you a pm with a link
[01:22] <vanberge> _3oo3, and you need a pretty beefy machine to do that
[01:22] <kitche> synchk, you will have to map one
[01:22] <A-L-A-R-M> cafuego:  i did what u exactly said. larm@rockpc:~/Desktop/rar$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin rar , did remove the rar file from the desktop/rar directory
[01:22] <cafuego> synchk: NO!
[01:22] <synchk> kitche: can i just move a key to the hole?
[01:22] <_3oo3> windows was run in dos, no?
[01:23] <cafuego> synchk: We do NOT suggest people pirate software on this channel.
[01:23] <Stormx2> _3oo3: Right. Let me get my facts straight. You want to run SUSE in Ubuntu, correct? Or do you want to dual-boot?
[01:23] <_3oo3> windows operating system
[01:23] <cafuego> synchk: However, vmware is free to use.
[01:23] <vanberge> lmao what is this guy talking about
[01:23] <brandon[1] > hey everyone
[01:23] <_3oo3> Storm: I want run suse in ubuntu
[01:23] <nightless_> TGPO: i don't have an x11 directory in /etc
[01:23] <nolimitsoya> synchk, Stormx2 i you two payed attention youd have seem that i was the first one to tip him of about vmware, and even let ubotu send him a link ;)
[01:23] <_james> help pls.. i mount my windows drive to my ubuntu by "mount -t ntfs /dev/hda5 /mnt" but i can't browse it through file browswer it said that i have no permission.. why is that?  the folder is locked
[01:23] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, damn .. that command is trying to remove the /usr/local/bin directory -- something i dont think you wanted
[01:23] <synchk> cafuego: what?
[01:23] <TGPO> nightless_: capitol X
[01:23] <cafuego> synchk: vmware. free.
[01:23] <synchk> cafuego: I never said to pirate it.
[01:23] <jbinder> _3oo3: suse is an operating system. so is ubuntu. you can't have both of them.  you can only choose one.
[01:23] <nightless_> TGPO: doh.
[01:23] <un_operateur1> what you really wanted is   -- sudo rm /usr/local/bin/rar
[01:23] <cafuego> synchk: "you can pirate vmware and use it"
[01:24] <A-L-A-R-M> but did it remove it ? the directory maybe not. hope not its content
[01:24] <Stormx2> jbinder: You can use VMWare to run SUSE within ubuntu.
[01:24] <_3oo3> jbinder:  why?  is assignment
[01:24] <jbinder> Stormx2: yeah
[01:24] <scott__> Hey guys, anyone have experience setting up Twinview?  Or know where a good tutorial is?
[01:24] <_3oo3> storm:  what is VMware?
[01:24] <synchk> and why is no one helping _3oo3?
[01:24] <kitche> synchk, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=11426 try what it says in there
[01:24] <synchk> and why is no one helping _3oo3?
[01:24] <jbinder> Stormx2: i didn't think he knew what that was
[01:24] <synchk> kitche: It doesn't work
[01:24] <jbinder> Stormx2: i thought he just doesn't understand how it works
[01:24] <jbinder> lol
[01:24] <cge> synchk: It looks to me like someone is.
[01:24] <vanberge> wow
[01:24] <Stormx2> jbinder: It lets you run SUSE from within Ubuntu. Is that what you want?
[01:24] <synchk> cge: they're not even helping him
[01:24] <_3oo3> why no one help?  is support channel for ubutu?
[01:24] <scott__> I tried a HOWTO on the forums for Twinview, but I ended up having to boot in recovery mode and restore my xorg.conf ....
[01:24] <_james> help pls.. i mount my windows drive to my ubuntu by "mount -t ntfs /dev/hda5 /mnt" but i can't browse it through file browswer it said that i have no permission.. why is that?  the folder is locked
[01:24] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, ive even sent you a pm explaining what vmware is. read it, and then come back
[01:24] <jbinder> Stormx2: i am not having the problem, it's _3oo3
[01:24] <cafuego> _3oo3: go to http://www.vmware.com and have a look at 'vmware player' and what it is.
[01:24] <vanberge> _3oo3, stop typing so much... everyone is helping you
[01:24] <_3oo3> I get no pm
[01:25] <jbinder> Stormx2: i am fully aware of how to use VMware
[01:25] <Stormx2> _3oo3: We don't PM people much
[01:25] <synchk> someone help _3oo3 to get him to shut up
[01:25] <_3oo3> no one is helping i still dont know how to use vmware
[01:25] <Stormx2> jbinder: Oh sorry
[01:25] <nolimitsoya> cafuego, why player when server is free? besides, player wont let him install suse
[01:25] <jbinder> Stormx2: heh
[01:25] <Stormx2> jbinder: That was meant for _3003
[01:25] <brandon[1] > Hey everyone, I have been waiting since July to install Ubuntu on my notebook hoping that the problems would be fixed on it, but nothing is changing on the laptop testing page.  Does this mean that things haven't been fixed for sure?
[01:25] <_3oo3> dont WANT vmWARE
[01:25] <nolimitsoya> !vmware > _3oo3
[01:25] <synchk> nolimitsoya: NO! don't tell people to pirate software!
[01:25] <_3oo3> want SUSE in UBUNTU not vmWARE
[01:25] <cafuego> nolimitsoya: I don't have 4 days to help him set up server.
[01:25] <fokuslee> bimberi if i use dpkg -r kernel-image-blah / kernel-header-blah i can remove those ones i don't use and it won't show in grub anymore rite?
[01:25] <vanberge> _3oo3, that is your only option
[01:25] <Stormx2> _3oo3: If you don't want VMWare, what do you want?
[01:25] <fokuslee> or do i have to edit grub myself ?
[01:25] <TGPO> _3oo3 we can only point you in the direction, you are going to have to do some work yourself
[01:25] <cafuego> nolimitsoya: and player is packaged; there's probably even an opensuse vm download
[01:25] <_3oo3> storm:  want SUSE in ubuntu
[01:25] <jbinder> brandon[1] : what "things"?
[01:25] <synchk> vanberge: if they can run dos in windows, they can run suse in ubuntu
[01:25] <nolimitsoya> synchk, what your problem? server if free for linux...
[01:25] <jbinder> _3oo3: download VMWare
[01:25] <Stormx2> _3oo3: Take a moment to write down your exact situation in detail, then say here.
[01:25] <vanberge> synchk, lol...
[01:26] <vanberge> _3oo3,  why do you want that?
[01:26] <synchk> nolimitsoya: Do NOT tell people to pirate software in this channel.
[01:26] <bimberi> fokuslee: i believe so yes
[01:26] <m0> hello, where do I change the refresh rate from 60 to 75
[01:26] <brandon[1] > On the laptop testing page, they say that resolution cannot be adjusted, sound doesn't work, wireless doesn't work and the scroll on the touchpad
[01:26] <_3oo3> Storm:  boss says run suse in ubuntu or fired.  have to or will have to go back home.
[01:26] <fokuslee> bimberi <3
[01:26] <vanberge> what kind of 'project' requires suse to run in ubuntu
[01:26] <nolimitsoya> synchk, you are either dense or just taking a piss. stop it, either way
[01:26] <jbinder> Stormx2: wait, don't you need a reg key for VMware though?
[01:26] <AfterDeath> _3oo3: wasn't this a class assignment?
[01:26] <Stormx2> Not sure, don't think so
[01:26] <synchk> nolimitsoya: stop pirating then vmware?
[01:26] <cafuego> jbinder: yes, but they email you one for free.
[01:26] <kitche> jbinder: you can get a free serial key for vmware server from their site
[01:26] <AfterDeath> _3oo3: earlier you said it was a class assignment
[01:26] <livingtm> My system wont boot since i installed a kernel update this afternoon.. where can i get help with that?.
[01:26] <jbinder> oh
[01:27] <cafuego> jbinder: vmware player and vmware server are free.
[01:27] <m0> The only thing i see in default settings is 60hz, I don't see 75 for Refresh rate
[01:27] <PORDO> livingtm probably ubuntuforums.org is a good place.
[01:27] <jbinder> cafuego: i use VMware workstation
[01:27] <nolimitsoya> synchk, i told you, vmware server is free for linux. its not pirating, you download it legaly from their site
[01:27] <_3oo3> AfterDeath:  yes, is class for job
[01:27] <synchk> nolimitsoya: downloading VMWARE just freely is illegal dude
[01:27] <cafuego> jbinder: That's payware to the best of my knowledge.
[01:27] <FirstStrike> livingtm: here too, if you can find someone to help.
[01:27] <jbinder> cafuego: yeah.
[01:27] <livingtm> PORDO, Im googling the heck out of it and not getting anything relevant
[01:27] <cafuego> synchk: no, it's not.
[01:27] <synchk> someone help _3oo3 and get him to shut up about it
[01:27] <synchk> cafuego: yes it is
[01:27] <Stormx2> We're trying
[01:27] <Stormx2> I'll PM him
[01:27] <nolimitsoya> synchk, no it isnt. accet it and move on. ill just think you are a troll if you dont, and youll get the proverbial /ignore
[01:27] <synchk> Stormx2: help him, damnit!
[01:27] <nolimitsoya> *accept
[01:28] <AfterDeath> _3oo3: is class for job?
[01:28] <cafuego> synchk: You can download it from vmware.com for exactly $free.
[01:28] <FirstStrike> livingtm: if it spits out any errors during bootup or during a safe mode boot, that'll be information people will need to help you.
[01:28] <_3oo3> Afterdeath:  yes, and no one help
[01:28] <brandon[1] > These are the problems that have been listed since July for my laptop: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/GatewayMX3414
[01:28] <vanberge> _3oo3, i dont htink you understand the project.
[01:28] <synchk> cafuego: I don't pirate software. Period.
[01:28] <_3oo3> vanberge no, but will go home if cant
[01:28] <synchk> cafuego: I pay for my software, and I'm proud of that.
[01:28] <livingtm> FirstStrike,  im not exactly sure  where the problem lies... Grub menu comes up ok, i does a whole lot of stuff (liek assembling raids) then says it cant mount my root file system (device not found)
[01:28] <TGPO> _3oo3 lots of people have helped you, your just ignoring them
[01:28] <AfterDeath> _3oo3: maybe because you're trolling. first you say its for a class assignment, now you say your boss will fire you
[01:28] <Stormx2> _3oo3: I've PMed you. Please respond.
[01:28] <kitche> synchk: read this page http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=11426 it says right on it The free VMware Server is based upon VMware?s proven virtualization technology. With this robust yet easy to use software you can:
[01:28] <synchk> cafuego: Some people have morals. I don't steal.
[01:28] <cafuego> synchk: Maybe you should have a look at vmware.com.
[01:28] <vanberge> _3oo3, what is the goal of your project
[01:28] <_3oo3> AfterDeath:  boss will fire if fail class
[01:28] <kitche> synchk, http://www.vmware.com/products/server/ this page

[01:28] <synchk> kitche: I don't pirate software, but thanks. :)

[01:29] <cafuego> synchk: See, vmware server is free from vmware.
[01:29] <_3oo3> cant go home
[01:29] <Stormx2> I suspect _3oo3 is just trying to piss us off, but lets have a little more patience.
[01:29] <LjL> synchk, VMWare Server is absolutely free (as in beer), no piracy, as is VMWare Player (which is even included in Multiverse). now stop trolling
[01:29] <Inspiron9201> Hello, I am a complete fan of Ubuntu.  Love the fact that so much works out of the box unlike CentOS.  I have just been stumped and plead for help.  My old Dell Inspiron 9200 screen worked great out of the box at something like 1700X1200 or something.  Now I only get a max option of 1024x768.  Any ideas how I could figure out a solution?  (BTW, I got vmware working great under Ubuntu and I did NOT pirate it.  Bought the full version).
[01:29] <Stormx2> _3oo3: Check your PM, please.
[01:29] <jbinder> brandon[1] : i don't get one of those problems

[01:31] <A-L-A-R-M> would it matter a lot that i am under kde ?

[01:31] <nolimitsoya> A-L-A-R-M, no, it wouldnt
[01:31] <Stormx2> XD~~
[01:31] <FirstStrike> Yahovah: If someone doesn't know the answer, then they can't help.
[01:31] <cafuego> Yahovah: Sadly, _3oo3 has also been ignoring all attempts at help.
[01:31] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, read the link i sent you
[01:31] <kitche> Yahovah, if you look people told him how to do it and he doesn't want to do it
[01:32] <Stormx2> Did anyone else just see that?
[01:32] <Stormx2> man..
[01:32] <A-L-A-R-M> so: sudo aptitude install rar unrar remains the same command ? dont net apt-get ?
[01:32] <Stormx2> _3oo3: What language do you speak?
[01:32] <A-L-A-R-M> dont 'need' i meant
[01:32] <_3oo3> Stormx2:  AMD 64 Bit?
[01:32] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: not really... it's just that you use Ark instead of FileRoller, assuming you even want a graphical interface for that (otherwise, just install unrar and "unrar x filename"
[01:32] <_3oo3> I tell you already!
[01:32] <Stormx2> _3oo3: No, thats your processer type.
[01:32] <Yahovah> cafuego, They haven't even been helping him. Just telling him to "read this" about some pirated software!

[01:32] <theilliniguy> nolimit - link u sent?
[01:32] <brandon[1] > idioma
[01:32] <nolimitsoya> A-L-A-R-M, use 'sudo apt-get install rar' or 'sudo apt-get install unrar'
[01:32] <mcquaid> anyone know an easy to use webserver?  Or do any have a front end for configuring?
[01:33] <cafuego> Yahovah: No, I've been telling him to go to a website where he can legelly and free obtain software that allows him to do what he needs to do.
[01:33] <FirstStrike> livingtm: not sure. head over to the forums and do a search there and see what it turns up.
[01:33] <_3oo3> I NEVER USE UBUNTU EVER AGAIN.  SUPPORT SUCKS.  NO ONE WANT TO HELP.
[01:33] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, yes, but ittl look as if it came from ubotwo. please read stuf when you are highlighted

[01:33] <Yahovah> cafuego, Yeah "obtain freely."
[01:33] <A-L-A-R-M> both are under console . ark is indeed with gui but doesnt support rar
[01:33] <cafuego> Yahovah: I doubt he's been to that site. If people won't help themselves, I won't waste energy on them.
[01:33] <FirstStrike> Bye
[01:33] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, leave now and never come back! *said with gollom vioce*
[01:33] <nolimitsoya> *voice

[01:34] <brandon[1] > If I install Ubuntu on my laptop and there is a problem, can I somehow remove it without reinstalling windows altogether?
[01:34] <kitche> Yahovah, umm The free VMware Server is based upon VMware?s proven virtualization technology. With this robust yet easy to use software you can: from vmware.com that's not pirating
[01:34] <cafuego> Yahovah: Read back and see what I said. I never suggested he pirate anything.
[01:34] <nolimitsoya> Yahovah, noone has been telling anyone to pirate anything. stop trolling you too
[01:34] <_3oo3> what happened?
[01:34] <FirstStrike> brandon[1] : Yea, install it on a different partition from windows.
[01:34] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, you where kicked for trolling. dont come back and start anew

[01:34] <brandon[1] > alright, and could I make that partition part of the windows partition again if I have to?
[01:34] <nolimitsoya> _3oo3, next time youll probably recieve a ban instead
[01:34] <vanberge> _3oo3, everyone has tried to help you.  you cannot run  a linux operating system inside another linux operating system without virtualizaton
[01:34] <_3oo3> nolimitsoya:  what is trolling dont

[01:44] <TGPO> Japanese_Hunk: why are you asking here?
[01:44] <aedes> Stormx2: I think that theres some ECC that happens to the iso before burning which causes it to get larger, but I don't think it should get that large

[01:44] <kitche> Japanese_Hunk: that is probaby a question that the open Office people can answer more then in there

[01:53] <ReWT_AxS> ty FirstStrike :)
[01:53] <Desert88> so any one know how to get back the power and restart buttons in system-->quit
[01:53] <Desert88> its really bugging me
[01:53] <Stormx2> Japanese_Hunk: Eek. Okay sorry. Try ubuntuforums.org
[01:53] <ReWT_AxS> anyone know of a good place to find custom start menu buttons?
[01:53] <Japanese_Hunk> nolimitsoya, I was referring to APP development
[01:53] <Stormx2> Japanese_Hunk: i don't think anyone in here knows.
[01:53] <Japanese_Hunk> Stormx2:  I did.
[01:53] <kd7swh> can anyone help me with my window maximization in KDE
[01:53] <Japanese_Hunk> nothing came up
[01:53] <Stormx2> Japanese_Hunk: Post a topic then ;-)
[01:53] <aedes> Japanese_Hunk: that has NOTHING to do with OOo
[01:54] <Guss> hi if i want to intall visual C++ on Xubuntu what do i have to do i have the CD here i already install WINE but now what do i have to do ?
[01:54] <alink1000> Alright, I'll print those instructions, thanks ubotwo. :)
[01:54] <ctkroeke1> m0: you still arround?
[01:54] <Desert88> so does anyone know how to get back the power and restart buttons in system--> quit they've mysteriously dissappeared
[01:54] <FirstStrike> odd
[01:54] <Japanese_Hunk> aedes:  I don't think you know what I'm asking, then.  That's not my fault, really.
[01:54] <cafuego> Guss: you need to run 'wine /path/to/cd/setup.exe' probably.
=== libshh_ is now known as libshh
[01:54] <kitche> Guess: mount the cd then do wine /path/to/exe/
[01:54] <FirstStrike> !wine | Guss
[01:54] <Ubotwo> Guss: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[01:54] <Erb> How do you reorder tasks in a panel?
[01:54] <kd7swh> Japanese_Hunk: please stop changing the topic, nobody can get help if you blast the channel
[01:54] <Stormx2> Japanese_Hunk: Post a topic. I don't think anyone in here knows the answer to your query. Sorry! :)
[01:55] <nolimitsoya> Japanese_Hunk, yes it is. youve managed to talk by 887 users in here. something is up with the cominucation if its that bad
[01:55] <max_> !CrossOver | Guss
[01:55] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that, and package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com and http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[01:55] <Guss> ok
[01:55] <alink1000> So, do those boot instructions apply to 6.10 too?
[01:55] <FirstStrike> alink1000: yes
[01:55] <Stormx2> alink1000: Yeah.
[01:55] <Desert88> ok can someone plzzz tell me how to get my power and restart buttons back in system-->quit menu
[01:55] <Japanese_Hunk> nolimitsoya:  I respect your perception, but I don't necessarily agree with it.
[01:55] <aedes> Japanese_Hunk: since you're the one that wants your question answered, then you'd better want me to understand it (so ask it in a way that actually makes sense)
[01:55] <FirstStrike> Desert88: No idea. Try the forums.
[01:55] <Stormx2> Desert88: How did you get rid of them?
[01:55] <alink1000> alright, thanks for your help. :)
[01:55] <tonyyarusso> Stop the debate about it now please.  If you want to ask you question, do so, wait 15-20 minutes, and ask again.  if you aren't helped, we're sorry, but it's not our fault.
[01:56] <Desert88> well I switched my session to xgl cuz im running beryl
[01:56] <Desert88> I think that might have something to do with it
[01:56] <kd7swh> I need help with beryl
[01:56] <Stormx2> Desert88: Quite possibly.
[01:56] <FirstStrike> Desert88: and..if you log back in without using xgl?
[01:56] <LjL> and now i should ban you others as well for being so offtopic. it's full of trolls as you can see - you know better than feeding them, really. if someone asks a question, answer it if you want/can, if someone just argues/trolls, ignore them
=== wmt is now known as Merse
[01:56] <Desert88> im about to try that
[01:56] <Stormx2> Japanese_Hunk: Have you tried rebooting? You can reboot from command line.
[01:56] <JustNew> hi guys. a few quick questions. my windows drives are read only. is there a way i can change that so that I can write files to them?
[01:56] <Stormx2> Ack

[01:57] <Stormx2> Caps / Swearing
[01:57] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya - think i followed all the linkns installs etc but still no dvd play??
[01:57] <JustNew> Thnkyouu
[01:57] <max_> when did Ubotwo change its name?
[01:57] <LjL> !bot
[01:57] <Ubotwo> This is a temporary Ubotu replacement. Please don't abuse it.
[01:57] <FirstStrike> JustNew: I can vouch for fuse, myself. I've been using it for 4 months now without issues.
[01:57] <Pichu0102> I got xchat2 on this Ubuntu comp.
[01:57] <Pichu0102> How can I make it do commands upon joining a channel?
[01:57] <max_> aalright, who killed Ubotu
[01:57] <cge> JustNew: There is also ntfs-3g
[01:58] <JustNew> FirstStrike: Thanks, I ill definately get it
[01:58] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, did you install the dvd package, and the dvd decryption system?
[01:58] <JustNew> cge: I will also look at that
[01:58] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, haveyou got aplayer that can play dvd:s, like vlc?
[01:58] <FirstStrike> Pichu0102: a channel or a server?
[01:58] <Pichu0102> A channel.
[01:58] <kitche> JustNew you will have to use umask also, so your user can have perms to write to the drive
[01:58] <kishan> !beryl
[01:58] <Ubotwo> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[01:58] <binarydigit> Pichu0102: xchat menu->srver list-> network, then click edit, and you will see the connect commands or join channel textbox
[01:58] <FirstStrike> Pichu0102: as far as i know, if you want it to perform anything on joining a channel you'll need a separate script for it.
[01:58] <Pichu0102> I'm trying to auto-login to IdleRPG but it keeps saying I'm not in the channel on reconnect.
[01:58] <JustNew> next annoying qestion: does anoyne know a program to convert videos to ipod format?
[01:59] <binarydigit> JustNew:mencoder *might* do it
[01:59] <JustNew> ok thanks ill have a look
[01:59] <FirstStrike> binarydigit: that's the on-connect for the server though, not a specific channel
[01:59] <kitche> JustinNew: there is many ipod video is just mp4 format
[01:59] <jrib> JustNew: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/iPodVideoEncoding
[01:59] <nolimitsoya> JustNew, sorry for bothering you, but do you know of a way of actualy getting the videos onto the ipod? all my attempts have failed misserably..
[01:59] <binarydigit> FirstStrike: ah then not sure
[01:59] <felixjet> how can i check a harddisk like scandisk?
[01:59] <Rappermas> ok, i installed the latest nvidia stable binary--everything, including beryl, is fine, but every time I reboot, X can't be started (it complains about nvidia module)--i have to re-install the nvidia binary from the command line restart GDM, but then it works fine
[01:59] <m0> yaay 38 minutes to download over wireless
[01:59] <Rappermas> now, i've fixed this before
[01:59] <Rappermas> i just don't remember how i did it
[01:59] <jrib> JustNew: even better: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/iPodVideo
[01:59] <binarydigit> Rappermas: it might be related to that bug with the new kernel update
[01:59] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya well i followed steps at the link you sent
[02:00] <JustNew> um, im not sure
[02:00] <Rappermas> there's a bug?
[02:00] <JustNew> ive only used gtkpod

[02:00] <nolimitsoya> jrib, thank you :)

[02:01] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, have you tried playing one with vlc?
[02:01] <libshh> i'm using irssi
[02:02] <h00t> can anyone tell me how to install nvidia binary drivers w/out using automatix or easyubuntu
[02:02] <jrib> !nvidia | h00t
[02:02] <Ubotwo> h00t: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:02] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya well no the link you sent was for plahying in totem
[02:02] <Rappermas> ok, it says that you can fix it by reinstalling the nvidia drivers
[02:02] <Rappermas> which i do
[02:02] <bimberi> !nvidia
[02:02] <Ubotwo> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:02] <h00t> why thank you sir
[02:02] <Rappermas> but on every reboot, the same thing happens
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, its universal. try vlc to begin with
[02:02] <Rappermas> now, I remember fixing this somehow...
[02:02] <Rappermas> but i don't remember what needs to be done to fix this
[02:03] <Rappermas> i mean, i can live with it, it's just that i don't want to compile a new driver on each boot up
[02:03] <Rappermas> that makes this into a five minute boot up
[02:03] <A-L-A-R-M> when i type on command line ps -x i get: alarm@rockpc:~$ ps -x
[02:03] <A-L-A-R-M> Warning: bad ps syntax, perhaps a bogus '-'? See http://procps.sf.net/faq.html
[02:03] <Rappermas> which is ridiculous
[02:03] <Rappermas> maybe the guys over on the beryl channel will come up with something
[02:03] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya i see audio and video sub menus.........what next?
[02:03] <Rappermas> i really should have written this down
[02:04] <bimberi> A-L-A-R-M: lose the "-"
[02:04] <A-L-A-R-M> also kde system guard when i open it, at the bottom shows: 88888888 processes . Memory: 888888888 but no proccess in the proccess table
[02:04] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, see them where?
[02:04] <fr500_> hello
[02:04] <fr500_> how's everyone
[02:04] <A-L-A-R-M> well i did . it doesnt so not even a line
[02:04] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, ok, pop a dvd in the drive, install vlc (sudo apt-get install vlc) and start it. press load disc
[02:04] <fr500_> question, why is that sun java is not available for me in ubuntu
[02:05] <fr500_> it says no installation candidate
[02:05] <A-L-A-R-M> it just stops there. the cursor goes one line down and nothing happens . even with ctrl^c it doesnt recover
[02:05] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya fin vlc - file/quick open file - then a bunch of vobs
[02:05] <kitche> fr500_: how are you installing it, but you probably don't have mutliverse enabled
[02:05] <bimberi> A-L-A-R-M: with 'ps x' ?
[02:05] <fr500_> i do have multiverse, it just says not available for my platform(i386)
[02:05] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, not open file, open disc
[02:06] <A-L-A-R-M> bimberi:  the same
[02:06] <jrib> fr500_: please post your /etc/apt/sources.list on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give us a URL please
[02:06] <A-L-A-R-M> it stops there
[02:06] <fr500_> jrib: ok
[02:06] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, the shortcut is ctrl+d
[02:06] <jrib> fr500_: also, what pacakge are you trying to install?
[02:06] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, or use file->open disc
[02:06] <bimberi> A-L-A-R-M: strange.  does 'top' run ok?  (press "q" to get out of it)
[02:07] <felixjet> how can i check an HD for errors?

[02:10] <nolimitsoya> IndyGUnFreak, never advice anyone to use either easyubuntu or automatix
[02:10] <Guss> were can i see my ubuntu version ?
[02:11] <bimberi> !version | Guss
[02:11] <Ubotwo> Guss: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[02:11] <IndyGUnFreak> whatever
[02:11] <Gumby> delight: if you are logged into the box that has something running on port 904 try netstat -tpan |grep 904
[02:11] <IndyGUnFreak> they both work fine for me.
[02:11] <nolimitsoya> !worksforme | IndyGUnFreak
[02:11] <Ubotwo> IndyGUnFreak: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[02:11] <Guss> !version
[02:11] <Ubotwo> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[02:11] <Gumby> delight: are you running vmware server perhaps?
[02:11] <kitche> felixjet: with fsck but the device has to be not mounted to do it or else you might get filesystem corruption
[02:11] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya well nnot so cool yet! lol....open disc doesnt show anything to load...........
[02:12] <IndyGUnFreak> well, agian, i've been using edgy, easyubuntu and automatix2 for a while, so i don't see the big issue.
[02:12] <delight> Gumby: cp        0      0 0.0.0.0:904             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     4965/rpc.mountd

[02:12] <felixjet> kitche: tried but it says something about bad magic number in super block
[02:12] <nolimitsoya> !automatix | IndyGUnFreak
[02:12] <Ubotwo> IndyGUnFreak: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[02:12] <r2> well, the link for the CANON PIXMA IP1000 drivers contained in the UBUNTU official support pages are broken :( and I can't find another mirror
[02:12] <delight> Gumby:  does it mean its because i mount a nfs ?
[02:12] <Gumby> delight: I think vmware server listens on port 904
[02:12] <kitche> felixjet: ah you have to use the repair switch then
[02:12] <delight> Gumby: no vmware installed
[02:12] <IndyGUnFreak> what is !worksforme?
[02:12] <IndyGUnFreak> never heard of that
[02:13] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya in VLC - it does autoload totem tho
[02:13] <nolimitsoya> IndyGUnFreak, thats what i gave you last time
[02:13] <felixjet> kitche: hoe
[02:13] <kitche> IndyGUnFreak, exactly what it says what works for you might not work for someone else
[02:13] <felixjet> how
[02:13] <felixjet> -r?
[02:13] <IndyGUnFreak> so whats the problem with EasyUbuntu?.. i think its been created by Ubuntu.
[02:13] <nolimitsoya> IndyGUnFreak, it hasnt
[02:13] <Gumby> delight: not sure then.  I use nfs and I dont have port 904 open
[02:13] <delight> Gumby:  netstat -tpan | grep 904 resulted in tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:904             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     4965/rpc.mountd
[02:13] <IndyGUnFreak> well, its homepage sure looks like Ubuntu's.., but i guess anyone could do that.
[02:13] <caminomaster> hi
[02:14] <bh__> Does the Install software menu on the mini.isio installer stall for a long time naturally ?
[02:14] <IndyGUnFreak> i guess i just don't get it, i've put it on 3 systems, none have experienced problems at all installing anything
[02:14] <nolimitsoya> IndyGUnFreak, automatix and easyubuntu are the same. now drop it
[02:14] <Gumby> delight: psaux |grep 4965
[02:14] <kitche> fleixjet: you can do man fsck to see the switches my switches are different since I use BSD tools
[02:14] <nolimitsoya> IndyGUnFreak, hence the !worksfor me
[02:14] <IndyGUnFreak> they aren't the same.
[02:14] <IndyGUnFreak> they do similar things.
[02:14] <IndyGUnFreak> but they aren't the same
[02:14] <LjL> !offtopic | IndyGUnFreak, nolimitsoya
[02:14] <Ubotwo> IndyGUnFreak, nolimitsoya: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[02:14] <Gumby> delight: sorry, ps aux |grep 4965
[02:14] <caminomaster> does anybody use ares with wine?
[02:14] <nolimitsoya> sorry LjL...
[02:15] <delight> Gumby: ok .. /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd
[02:15] <delight> mound deamon for nfs ... strange
[02:16] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya well not so cool yet! lol....open disc doesnt show anything to load...........
[02:16] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya in vlc
[02:16] <caminomaster> someone uses ares with wine?
[02:17] <pacman> Does anyone know of a equalizer that I can download?  I use VLC and the equalizer sucks.
[02:17] <lovloss> is ubuntu's "wine" package the most up to date, or do i need to build it from source?
[02:17] <LjL> !wine
[02:17] <Ubotwo> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[02:18] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, winehq provides its own repos with the latest build
[02:18] <LjL> lovloss: there are some repositories available that are probably more up to date
[02:18] <lovloss> I know what wine is...
[02:18] <lovloss> oh
[02:18] <kitche> lovloss: the wine repo is up to date
[02:18] <LjL> lovloss: i'm sure you do, still if you read that page, you'll find the information you were looking for
[02:18] <kitche> the official wine repo from their website
[02:18] <willskills> WoW is running just great thanks :)
[02:18] <willskills> and CS:S ;)
[02:19] <lovloss> I just got something, a directx 8 patch for wine. Its a ".patch" file. does anyone know how to use these?
[02:19] <nolimitsoya> quick one, is it ok to use th winehq repo for edgy under fiesty?
[02:19] <zakaria> hi everybody
[02:19] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, are you sure it isnt integrated already?
[02:19] <LjL> lovloss, i think you'll need the source for that
[02:19] <kitche> lovloss: you need the wine sources to use it then patch p0 < <file>.patch
[02:19] <FirstStrike> lovloss: you have to compile wine with the patch
[02:20] <lovloss> I see... im not sure if its integrated or not. it has its own sourceforge page
[02:20] <zakaria> i have a ptoblem : how can i choose mplayer as video default player fore firefox instead of totem?
[02:21] <nolimitsoya> zakaria, install mozilla-mplayer
[02:21] <lovloss> I heard Wine is about to integrate directx 9 :)
[02:21] <anorexicpillow> Hello... I use fire fox and it crashes when i have multiple tabs on a certain site... i think its because of all the ads there. is there any way i can get rid of the ads?
[02:21] <lovloss> the Sims 2 is expected to work
[02:21] <arrenlex> anorexicpillow: Download the adblock plus extension.
[02:21] <zakaria> nolimitsoya: ok , i'll do it
[02:21] <nolimitsoya> anorexicpillow, try adblocker, or flashblocker
[02:21] <anorexicpillow> ok
[02:22] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya cant get it to load in vlc..:(
[02:22] <ReWT_AxS> where is config editor?
[02:22] <ReWT_AxS> http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=381182&postcount=4
[02:22] <arrenlex> ReWT_AxS: If you could read, you would see that the article says it is in Applications -> System Tools -> Configuration Editor
[02:23] <zakaria> nolimitsoya: i've already done it . i checked my packages manager
[02:23] <ReWT_AxS> i dont see system tools in applications
[02:23] <ReWT_AxS> do you?
[02:23] <ReWT_AxS> didn't think so
[02:23] <zakaria> nolimitsoya: but it's still doesn't work
[02:23] <tonyyarusso> ReWT_AxS: You can also run it with the command 'gconf-editor'
[02:23] <arrenlex> ReWT_AxS: I can't answer that question because I don't run gnome. :)
[02:23] <theilliniguy> i have a truecrypt partition on external HD - can Iget at the files?
[02:24] <lovloss> how come when i apt-get update it stops and says "run apt-get update to fix these problems"... some registry thing
[02:25] <`m0> I think I messed up my upgrading to edgy :s
[02:25] <`m0> it froze while doing the command
[02:25] <`m0> so I restarted it
[02:25] <arrenlex> lovloss: You mean key authentication?
[02:25] <lovloss> arrentlex: yes
[02:25] <lovloss> arrenlex: yes lol
[02:26] <binarydigit> theilliniguy: yea, just use truecrypt and mount the partition
[02:26] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, have you enabled third party repos?
[02:26] <ghoop> hello, can someone help me with a sound issue in the 6.06 release?
[02:26] <anorexicpillow> okay thanks this seems to be working well
[02:26] <lovloss>  nolimitsoya yeah
[02:26] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, then they might not authenticate themselves. just disregard that error message
[02:27] <lovloss> nolimitsoya: But its not updating
[02:27] <Valmarko> How can I have access to backports content. ?
[02:27] <tonyyarusso> !backports | Valmarko
[02:27] <Ubotwo> Valmarko: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[02:27] <ghoop> im trying to get SPDIF to work and I spent a long time last night searching google and trying different configurations but still no luck. i have an Audigy 2 Value
[02:27] <G|wRGoS> hi all
[02:28] <emun> Just curious, is it possible to install WinXP on a drive that has UBUNTU already installed in primary partition
[02:28] <theilliniguy> binarydigit thx
[02:28] <arrenlex> !hi
[02:28] <G|wRGoS> can u tell me which is the best chat client for linux?
[02:28] <schisms> xchat
[02:28] <arrenlex> emun: Yes, but you will have to reinstall grub afterward.
[02:28] <schisms> sudo apt-get install xchat
[02:28] <ablyss> best is a matter of user tastes
[02:28] <schisms> True.
[02:28] <binarydigit> G|wRGoS: depends who you ask
[02:28] <G|wRGoS> yea but this client dont saw the users.....
[02:29] <schisms> But I find xchat to be the best.
[02:29] <G|wRGoS> ehm......ok thx :)
[02:29] <nolimitsoya> !lostirc | G|wRGoS
[02:29] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that, and package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com and http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[02:29] <schisms> Depends on what you're familiar with.
[02:29] <nolimitsoya> bah...
[02:29] <nolimitsoya> anyway, check out lostirc G|wRGoS
[02:30] <ablyss> xchat is good if you like to idle in a chat room, mainly because it has a nice buffer que
[02:30] <emun> so what is grub and how will you do this installation of winxp
[02:30] <ablyss> plus lots of scripting support if you like to script
[02:30] <lovloss> I cant use the winehq repo because the public key cant be authenticated. even update manager refuses to refresh
[02:30] <G|wRGoS> what about Ksirc
[02:30] <G|wRGoS> ?
[02:30] <nolimitsoya> !grub | emun
[02:30] <Ubotwo> emun: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:30] <ablyss> ksirc sucks horribly
[02:30] <Guss> damm i intalled the WINE and put the visual C++ CD in and click on Setup.exe but it dosent work
[02:31] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, you are updated. run 'sudo apt-get update' and youll see
[02:31] <max_> imhaving a problem, in fire fox all my flash is going ontop of everything else, so i cant see drop down menus, there behind the flash...anyone know how to fix
[02:31] <schisms> Wine isn't perfect.
[02:31] <ablyss> konvsersation is nice if you like kde backend
[02:31] <ablyss> er, konversation
[02:31] <schisms> max, I think how flash works depends on the computer.
[02:31] <emun> so when you lose grub can you boot into ubuntu
[02:31] <schisms> Try downloading flash 9 beta.
[02:31] <G|wRGoS> and something else......mde or gnome is better?i mean faster and more friendly
[02:31] <lovloss> nolimitsoya: Every time i do that it runs through a TON of wine files, then stops and says it cant proceed because no public key is available
[02:32] <lovloss> and then it tells me to apt-get update again
[02:32] <Guss> damm i intalled the WINE and put the visual C++ CD in and click on Setup.exe but it dosent work.. help plisssss
[02:32] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, yes, and i told you to dissregard that message and just run apt-get install win
[02:32] <nolimitsoya> *wine
[02:32] <ablyss> Guss, maybe the wine channel could be helpful
[02:32] <lovloss> hmmm ok...
[02:33] <cge> Guss: I doubt that visual C++ will work under wine
[02:33] <cge> Guss: Have you checked the compatibility database at winehq.org?
[02:33] <lovloss> should i download the wine compatibility layer or anything extra like that?
[02:33] <Guss> i read wine webpage and it was on their list
[02:33] <theilliniguy> binarydigit i dont fin d truecrypt in synaptic.....??
[02:33] <cge> Guss: oh
[02:33] <Guss> visual c++ 6.0
[02:33] <binarydigit> theilliniguy: compile it from the truecrypt website
[02:33] <IndyGUnFreak> Guss, you could try the commercial version of Wine, i've had pretty good luck with it... http://www.codeweavers.com
[02:33] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, wine is wine. that _is_ the compatibility layer
[02:34] <lovloss> ok...
[02:34] <IndyGUnFreak> its got a free trial.
[02:34] <cge> Guss: I will agree there. Crossover works wonderfully.
[02:34] <lovloss> IndyGUnFreak: I heard that is great
[02:34] <theilliniguy> binarydigit - eek - newb here - how do i do that?????????
[02:34] <IndyGUnFreak> it works very well for me lov.
[02:34] <ablyss> personally i like opera's built in irc client.. its built on QT, is skinnable, has spell checker, some icons ( emoticons ) and connects pretty fast
[02:34] <Guss> IndyGUnFreak if i install wine i only have to doble click on setup.exe ???
[02:34] <IndyGUnFreak> i dont' use wine, i use crossover.
[02:34] <nolimitsoya> !build | theilliniguy
[02:34] <lovloss> IndyGUnFreak: I havent gotten *one* ofr my games to work on Wine yet. Not a single one. :P
[02:34] <Ubotwo> theilliniguy: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[02:34] <cge> Guss: If that doesn't work, you could try running it with wine in the terminal.
[02:34] <Guss> ohhh
[02:35] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, you mightwant to take a peek at cedega
[02:35] <Guss> i dont know how to use terminal
[02:35] <Guss> :(
[02:35] <IndyGUnFreak> yea, im not much of a gamer,
[02:35] <lovloss> nolimitsoya: You pay monthly for that right?
[02:35] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, yes
[02:35] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya i did a search in synaptic - zip
[02:35] <cge> lovloss: There are some games that work under Codeweavers' Crossover Office that don't work under Wine, but in general newer games don't work too well.
[02:35] <IndyGUnFreak> gus, just open a termina, wine "/pathtofile/nameoffile.exe"
[02:35] <IndyGUnFreak> include the quotes
[02:35] <nolimitsoya> theilliniguy, i sent you the message so you could read up on compiling
[02:35] <Guss> off ok thanks
[02:35] <lovloss> Im not much of a gamer anymore, but i have a huge collection and i dont want to just let it sit there
[02:36] <lovloss> besides, i always like a good adventure game
[02:36] <IndyGUnFreak> only game i really play is Pokerstars
[02:36] <cge> lovloss: For older games, crossover might work, and it is just a straight purchase.
[02:36] <ablyss> though opera has no chat buffer ( that i know of ) and that will make it hard to idle in a channel especially many channels, as the buffer will flush
[02:36] <lovloss> cge: but codega is good for games
[02:36] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, the best way is a dualboot imho...
[02:36] <ablyss> will not*, sorry
[02:36] <cge> lovloss: true
[02:36] <IndyGUnFreak> i just really needed MS Office as opposed to OpenOffice.., and it just never ran very well for me under Wine.
[02:36] <lovloss> nolimitsoya: but then i have to use... nnf... winblows
[02:36] <IndyGUnFreak> so it was worth the 30 bucks to buy crossover, cuz it works perfectly throug hit.
[02:36] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, true. no pain, no gain ;)
[02:37] <emun> what is wine please and what is xwindow
[02:37] <theilliniguy> nolimitsoya got it thx
[02:37] <nolimitsoya> !wine | emun
[02:37] <Ubotwo> emun: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[02:37] <IndyGUnFreak> emun.. http://www.wineh.com
[02:37] <lovloss> Why wont big gaming companies just program a linux compatibility thing into their products? would it kill them?
=== ttyfscker_ is now known as ttyfscker
[02:37] <nolimitsoya> emun, x is the system that displays al the nifty graphics on your screen
[02:37] <lovloss> or is windows paying them off
[02:37] <cge> lovloss: It wouldn't be profitable.
[02:37] <nolimitsoya> emun, without it, youd just have a text terminal
[02:37] <emun> thanks
[02:37] <cge> lovloss: Especially since many use directx
[02:38] <lovloss> cge: grr. See, this is why im entering the business.
[02:38] <nolimitsoya> cge, there is no technical reason not to use opengl/openal, and if you do that, linux compatbility is a piece of cake
[02:38] <IndyGUnFreak> cge, that seems to be the big issue with games
[02:38] <lovloss> exactly
[02:38] <ablyss> wine has very nice support of directx
[02:38] <con-man> i am running twinview, and I am curious, how do I tell X to make my right monitor the main monitor. my login prompt, task bar all appear on the left monitor
[02:38] <ablyss> and some activex too
[02:38] <IndyGUnFreak> im not much of a gamer, i just hear constant problems of wine and games, so i always figured it wsa probably a directx prob.
[02:39] <lovloss> All they have to do is compile the source during installation to match your operating system. And then they'd hit a niche market
[02:39] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, you dont even need that. all you need is elf binaries instead of coff ones
[02:39] <IndyGUnFreak> only game i really want to play is World of Warcraft, which has platinum status on codweavers,... but i've never gotten around to usin git.
[02:39] <IndyGUnFreak> plus i've heard of some folks being banned for using WOW w/ codweavers or wine
[02:40] <lovloss> nolimitsoya: really? Then why dont they, its so effortless
[02:40] <nightless> hello there can anyone help me get my wireless card working?  it's being a pain, its natively supported by ubuntu according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported
[02:40] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, epic, fex, include them on their install cd:s
[02:40] <con-man> i am running twinview, and I am curious, how do I tell X to make my right monitor the main monitor. my login prompt, task bar all appear on the left monitor
[02:40] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, couse they are stupid end evil :)
[02:40] <ablyss> IndyGUnFreak: recently, within the past 4 months or so, wine recently had a major directX update
[02:40] <Guss> cge did you buy crossover license ?
[02:40] <lovloss> nolimitsoya: Corperations for you
[02:40] <evil_> I cannot get ubuntu to work with my radeon 9250, is there a fix for this?
[02:40] <lovloss> Neverwinter NIghts has always kept a linux patch for their stuff.
[02:40] <lovloss> *praises*
[02:40] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm, my 9550 is awesome.
[02:40] <nolimitsoya> lovloss, so has epic and id
[02:40] <lovloss> I see =)
[02:41] <nightless> don't discuss wine here, do it on #wine or #winehq
[02:41] <Valmarko> Now that I have backports in the reps. how do I install flash plugin - firefox?
[02:41] <cge> Guss: yes
[02:41] <nolimitsoya> Valmarko, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[02:41] <Guss> ahh ok
[02:41] <lovloss> anyway, yeah. im going to go try this stuff. thanks everyone
[02:41] <Valmarko> tanks.
[02:41] <SmoothOp> did you get it to do 3d, indy?
[02:41] <IndyGUnFreak> guss i bought it about 4mo ago, works fine.
[02:41] <nightless> anyone have a linksys wireless card they got working with ubuntu?
[02:41] <Guss> IndyGUnFreak ahh ok
[02:42] <Guss> IndyGUnFreak thanks
[02:42] <IndyGUnFreak> i don't do hardcore gaming Smoothop.,
[02:42] <evil_> I cannot get ubuntu to work with my radeon 9250, is there a fix for this?
[02:42] <emun> hello there actually I have on my computer radeon9250 -no problem  installation regonised it
[02:42] <ubuntu_noob> hello, I have serious problems getting to run my BCM 4318 wireless adapter with ubuntu 6.10...can someone help me?
[02:43] <IndyGUnFreak> i play PlanetPenguin Racer, KSnakeRace, Pokerstars, and KBattleship
[02:43] <IndyGUnFreak> so needless to say, my graphics card doesn't really get pushed.
[02:43] <SmoothOp> oh
[02:43] <IndyGUnFreak> oh and Kirstet.. can't forget that one..(tetris)
[02:43] <nightless> i need support with wireless cards, if anyone can
[02:44] <nolimitsoya> IndyGUnFreak, check out brutalchess as well :)
[02:44] <nolimitsoya> !wifi | nightless
[02:44] <Ubotwo> nightless: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:44] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[02:44] <mtholdenss> hey i just installed compiz and xgl on my new edgy machine, it seems its not working all that well, when i log into xgl on ubuntu edgy it doesnt have the normal theme, its like blue, and compiz seems old, it all worked fine on drapper drake
[02:44] <IndyGUnFreak> i installed the KDE interface beside my Gnome interface, just for the games..lol
[02:44] <nightless> nolimitsoya ive already checked the docs, but thanks
[02:44] <IndyGUnFreak> but i generally stay in Gnome, I don't know how anyone uses KDE...
[02:44] <seamus7> Hi... I'm trying to update ATI's propietary driver for my Radeon Mobile X1300 video card but it's not going well .. my screen freezes at the login forcing me to revert to my original xorg.conf file :(
[02:44] <nolimitsoya> IndyGUnFreak, i think you can just pull the games from the repos...
[02:44] <ablyss> kde is great
[02:44] <IndyGUnFreak> i couldn't get that to work, so i just installed the whole desktop..lol
[02:45] <ryanakca> how do you install keyboard maps?
[02:45] <IndyGUnFreak> 280gig hard drive, space was no real concern.
[02:45] <ReWT_AxS> grrr i cant get this menu icon to change
[02:45] <ReWT_AxS> >.<
[02:45] <ReWT_AxS> for my start button
[02:45] <nolimitsoya> ryanakca, you dont, normaly. run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select what layout you want
[02:45] <IndyGUnFreak> I prefer Gnome over them all, Xfce over KDe, and Terminal over KDE...lol
[02:45] <con-man> i am running twinview, and I am curious, how do I tell X to make my right monitor the main monitor. my login prompt, task bar all appear on the left monitor
[02:45] <ryanakca> nolimitsoya: aye, but it seems that my keyboard maps have been uninstalled...
[02:46] <nolimitsoya> switch places of gnome and xfce, and im with IndyGUnFreak :)
[02:46] <ryanakca> nolimitsoya: well, not uninstalled, but I only have my default one left
[02:46] <evil_> I cannot get ubuntu to work with my radeon 9250, is there a fix for this?
[02:46] <tonyyarusso> Gnome vs. KDE is an !offtopic discussion here.  Support only please.
[02:46] <IndyGUnFreak> i've got an old 600mhz PC that I put Xubuntu on, Xfce is great to..
[02:46] <IndyGUnFreak> tony ask your question.
[02:46] <emun> could it be bios problem with the radeon 9250?
[02:47] <evil_> I get an xserver error when booted into ubuntu
[02:47] <drivera90> Is there a way to remove the ugly fonts?
[02:48] <seamus7> When I try fglrxinfo ... I get something about XFree86-DRI missing on display "0.0" ...
[02:48] <Asc> drivera90: You're getting fonts with overlapping letters and such?
[02:48] <evil_> Nobody knows anything about my problem?
[02:49] <drivera90> Nah. I don't really know what I'm doing, to be honest. I just got the Windows fonts, and I want my favorite website to look exactly like it used to.
[02:49] <tonyyarusso> evil_: Have you looked for you card on the wiki?
[02:49] <evil_> Which wiki?
[02:49] <drivera90> But now some of the fonts are Ubuntu fonts.
[02:49] <emun> had to let the bios use the radeon9250 in the agp slot as the default
[02:50] <evil_> What wiki? And mine is PCI, not VG
[02:50] <evil_> AVG
[02:50] <tonyyarusso> evil_: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport, look under components, video cards.
[02:50] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, change to times new roman as deafult font in firefox
[02:50] <Asc> *VGA
[02:50] <evil_> thanks tonyyarusso
[02:50] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, size 16 should be close to windows standard
[02:50] <Asc> drivera90: Not my area of expertise.  It should pick the correct fonts if you have them installed.  Other than that....
[02:51] <nolimitsoya> drivera90, edit->preferences->content->set to times new roman size 16
[02:51] <emun> got you , evil , I wonder about the pci radeon
[02:52] <evil_> What is breezy?
[02:52] <IndyGUnFreak> an old version of ubuntu
[02:52] <evil_> oh
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> Breez>Dapper>Edgy
[02:53] <tonyyarusso> Old, but still supported.  (minor note)
[02:53] <unikon>  anyone how does one  actiavate  dial up connectivity on dapper application-system-networking this person DOES now all the info to fill in like the dial up info
[02:53] <emun> evil does your mobo have onboard video
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> i saw a post froms omeone the other day on LQ, couldn't get any Breezy repos to work.
[02:53] <unikon>  but what else should i tell tthis person
[02:53] <bimberi> unikon: i used pppconfig
[02:53] <drivera90> Hm. nolimitsoya, I don't seem to have Times New Roman, but I did install msttcorefonts.
[02:53] <drivera90> :/
[02:54] <tonyyarusso> unikon: If the modem already works, the Gnome PPP dialogue is pretty straightforward.  If not, see !modem.  On cli, wvdial is the tool.
[02:54] <unikon>  how  did u get it to work bimberi
[02:54] <tonyyarusso> !modem | unikon
[02:54] <Ubotwo> unikon: You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[02:54] <TheMonoTone> is there a sure fire way of getting the fglrx drivers working properly without showing up as using mesa
[02:55] <joseph461> Hey, could anyone tell me if a Linksys WUSB54G will work on ubuntu 6.06.1 lts?
[02:55] <bimberi> unikon: 'sudo pppconfig', answer lots of questions and use 'sudo pon' and 'sudo poff' from then on.  wvdial is probably better but I just used what I know.
[02:55] <unikon> cool
[02:56] <con-man> i am running twinview, and I am curious, how do I tell X to make my right monitor the main monitor. my login prompt, task bar all appear on the left monitor
[02:56] <slyboots_> Evening
[02:57] <drivera90> nolimitsoya: Nevermind, I got it working.
[02:57] <slyboots_> Having some problems getting TwinView to work under Ubunut (6.10.1)
[02:57] <nolimitsoya> nighty all :)
[02:57] <slyboots_> the display shows up on my TV (DVI) but not on my TFT monitor (VGA but with a DVI converter)
[02:58] <evil_> damnit, I really dont want to go back to windows :(
[02:58] <slyboots_> (Monitor just shows up "No Signal) then cuts out
[02:58] <SmoothOp> is there a way i can edit the preferences for gnome bittorrent
[02:59] <bimberi> unikon: actually that would be "wvdial is probably better but I stopped looking once pppconfig worked because I'm lazy" :P
[02:59] <unikon> lol
[03:02] <ubuntu_noob> hello, can someone help me getting my bcm4318 wireless chip to run with ubuntu? I tried ndiswrapper and it says hardware would be present and driver loaded, but no network device shows up :(

[03:08] <function1> azureus crashes right after the window opens.. strange it worked just last night
[03:08] <joseph461> is a linksys wusb54g compatible with ubuntu 6.06.1 lts?
[03:08] <slyboots_> Well, With Twinview Enabled my TV switches on.. but the PC monitor switches off
[03:08] <cafuego> function1: To fix that, switch to the GNU java, start azureus. Then stop azureus, switch to SUn java, and restart azureus.
[03:08] <nightless> can someone please help me =/  my eth0 was working fine until i tried to install my wireless card, now neither work, even after taking the wireless card back out.  i need to install network-manager-gnome for the wireless card, i know that, but now i can't connect to the internet at all on that machine.
[03:08] <ciscosurfer> function1: have you tried out Deluge, it's a new GTK-based torrent client
[03:08] <slyboots_> The TV is connected via DVI to HDMI, and the PC monitor is connected via DVI to VGA
[03:09] <MatthewV> con-man, so what's happening now? as in, how do things display atm?
[03:09] <function1> k thanks will try both.
[03:09] <con-man> well everything is fine, except my left monitor is the main monitor, with the taskbar screen, X login screen

[03:10] <corevette> my internet is going sooo slow, but gaim/xchat seem to be running fine, whatsup?
[03:10] <function1> cafuego: by switching, do you mean (un)installing packages?
[03:10] <con-man> stars: busted!
[03:10] <ciscosurfer> corevette: can you expound on your issue?
[03:10] <drivera90> Someone recommend a nice font/color/background combination for IRC.
[03:10] <slyboots_> I think it may not be detecting the PC Monitor correctly.. Perhaps because Im using a DVI to VGA converter box
[03:11] <somerville32> drivera90, White background, black foreground :P
[03:11] <cafuego> function1: No, just running 'sudo update-alternatives --config java'
[03:11] <MatthewV> con-man, usually that is actually set in the BIOS, where one screen has to be set as the boot screen, or at least with a PCI/AGP setup.. i'm not sure with twinview i'm sorry, but you might be able to see if there is something like that
[03:11] <somerville32> drivera90, Or inverse it
[03:11] <somerville32> Black background, white foreground
[03:11] <marmer> which is the command for add file to an zip archive that i want to create, for example if i'm in photo and  i want to one file with all photo in directory which is the command, i've tried with  " zip -d *.* /photo.zip but it dont work
[03:12] <drivera90> What about font? Courier New looks really ugly in XChat
[03:12] <cafuego> Courier New looks ugly in anything.
[03:12] <dsnyders> Hi all.  Why does synaptic want to install kasteroids (a game) when I install bacula (a backup software)?
[03:12] <nightless> <-needs help.  eth0 was working fine, no problems, but after isntalling my wireless card it has stopped working, and my wireless card didnt work, so i uninstalled the wireless card but now my ethernet doesn't work.  ifconfig shows it, but dhclient eth0 is coming up with "NODHCPOFFERS recieved, no working leases in persistant database"  :(
[03:12] <cafuego> drivera90: Give DejaVu a go.
[03:12] <slyboots_> con-man, Option      "TwinViewOrientation"      "RightOf" / Change that to "LeftOf"
[03:12] <slyboots_> See if that helps at all
[03:12] <function1> ah ok
[03:12] <drivera90> What's DejaVu?
[03:12] <cafuego> drivera90: a free/open font
[03:12] <evil_> My gfx card not workking on ubuntu, does that mean it won't work with debian?
[03:12] <drivera90> Does it come with Ubuntu?
[03:12] <cafuego> drivera90: Yes
[03:13] <drivera90> Oh
[03:13] <drivera90> That's really nice.
[03:13] <con-man_> MatthewV: sorry I had to restart
[03:13] <drivera90> So soft.
[03:13] <con-man_> MatthewV: did you find any solution?
[03:13] <slyboots_> con-man, Option      "TwinViewOrientation"      "RightOf" / Change that to "LeftOf"
[03:13] <synchk> So very very soft.
[03:13] <con-man_> haha
[03:13] <function1> cafuego: ok working now thanks :)
[03:13] <MatthewV> con-man_, no i didnt slyboots_ may know though
[03:14] <con-man_> slyboots_: that doesnt change anything. my left one is still the main one, and now it thinks that monitor
[03:14] <con-man_> is on the righyt
[03:14] <synchk> That's what I miss about her most, those soft young lips against my stubbly cheek.
[03:14] <cafuego> function1: yeah.. i have the same issue with it (annoying)
[03:14] <slyboots_> No idea then
[03:14] <pr3d4t0r> Greetings.
[03:14] <MatthewV> con-man_, did you get what i said about BIOS?
[03:14] <evil_> My gfx card not workking on ubuntu, does that mean it won't work with debian?
[03:14] <slyboots_> I cant get mien to work either though so..
[03:14] <con-man_> MatthewV: BIOS?>
[03:14] <function1> cafuego: so whats the problem then? azureus package was built with gcj so it doesnt like sun java?
[03:14] <Enselic__> How do I tell synaptic to use the edgy repos version of a lib instead of my manually installed, higer version lib?
[03:15] <stefg> Enselic__: ctrl-e ... force version
[03:15] <MatthewV> con-man_, yes... with a PCI/AGP set up some of those things, like which screen the boot graphics display on, which screen grub displays on etc are set in BIOS... but I have no idea as far as twinview goes
[03:15] <con-man_> heh
[03:15] <nightless> My eth0 has suddenly stopped working after installing/uninstalling a wireless card.  ifconfig shows eth0 but dhclient doesn't recieve and offers... it wont work suddenly.
[03:15] <MatthewV> things like grub and splash occur before X is started, and therefore arent set by any xorg.conf options
=== JaeSharp is now known as JaeSharpZZZ
[03:16] <drivera90> Hm. White background is a bit hard on the eyes.
[03:16] <scott__> Is there anyone here that has experience modifying xorg.conf for twinview?  Ive got 2 19 LCDs here, having some trouble getting twinview to work...
[03:16] <drivera90> I'll try gray.
[03:16] <marmer> someone can help me with zip
[03:16] <stefg> !xinerama
[03:16] <Ubotwo> xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo

[03:17] <scott__> I dont want Xinerama ...I want twinview
[03:17] <scott__> =(
[03:17] <scott__> ooh
[03:17] <scott__> sorry reading now
[03:18] <con-man_> does anyone know of ALSA causing a whole system to lock up?
[03:18] <con-man_> ive switched to OSS
[03:18] <con-man_> but im wondering
[03:18] <dsnyders> Hi all.  Why does synaptic want to install kasteroids (a game) when I install bacula (a backup software)?
[03:19] <foob> so you can play it while backing up?
[03:19] <un_operateur1>  :))
[03:19] <con-man_> MatthewV: its funny, ive switched the cables on the monitors, and it still gives me the issue.
[03:19] <con-man_> MatthewV: kinda kreepy
[03:19] <dsnyders> foob, D'oh!  Why didn't I think of that?
[03:19] <marmer> someone can say me a good alarm program for wake up morning with computer
[03:19] <marmer> please

[03:20] <jrib> marmer: cron
[03:20] <nightless> my eth0 has suddenly stopped working after isntalling a wireless card.  can anyone help me troubleshoot?
[03:20] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, you can always install kasteroids now and remove it later
[03:20] <jrib> !cron | marmer
[03:20] <Ubotwo> marmer: cron is a way to schedule execution of software/scripts. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto  -  There is also a decent Howto at http://www.tech-geeks.org/contrib/mdrone/cron&crontab-howto.htm
[03:20] <con-man_> does nvidia always default the analog monitor to the main monitor?
[03:21] <MatthewV> con-man_, yeah, i'm sorry, cause I've never used twinview, only the 2 gfx cards setup
[03:21] <marmer> thank you a lot
[03:21] <un_operateur1> !xmms-alarm
[03:21] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that, and package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com and http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[03:22] <pr3d4t0r> Q. I have a new Ubuntu Edgy box set up as a gateway, 2 NICs; all ports are closed except for 22; iptables rules are identical to another Linux, non-Ubuntu box.  I can SSH into it from the internal network but not from the outside world.  Is there a default firewall that is turned on by default beyond iptables?  I need to solve this before I begin yelling at Covad.  Thanks in advance.
[03:22] <dsnyders> un_operateur1, Synaptic wants to install a whole mess of things: kjumpingcubes, korn, flac, atlantic, kadressbook, etc.
[03:23] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, I find that funny -- errm, on a more serious note, you can always install bacula from source
[03:23] <cge> I have a rather large file (ubuntu-6.10-server iso) on one computer which I need to transfer to another as quickly as possible. Does anyone have any recommendations about how to do so? scp is extremely slow. I've piped it through netcat before, but that is rather unstable. They are both on the LAN, so security isn't an issue.
[03:23] <dsnyders> un_operateur1, In fact, It looks like it is installing the whole KDE evironment
[03:23] <stefg> pr3d4t0r: no default firewall besides iptables
[03:24] <pr3d4t0r> stefg: OKi - time to start yelling at Covad then.  Thank you.
[03:24] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, thats odd -- maybe there is a KDE/Qt front end to bacula that depends on KDE which inturn depends on all these various other packages
[03:24] <cge> pr3d4t0r: Probably covad's fault, yes.
[03:24] <emun> help, what can I use to burn an iso image, trying to make gpart live-cd
[03:24] <pr3d4t0r> cge: I suspected as much but wanted to double-check before I call them; this helps me tell the script reader to just transfer me to a supervisor who knows what I'm talking about :)
[03:24] <dsnyders> un_operateur1, Perhaps, but nothing but games should depend on kamusements.
=== Defend is now known as defend
[03:25] <pr3d4t0r> Have a great night, Everyone.
[03:25] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, there are some odd dependants on that package -- i think they depend on the libraries
[03:25] <un_operateur1> .. of some of the games/games-engines
[03:26] <dsnyders> un_operateur1, perhaps there is a setting in synaptic for recommended packages vs strict dependencies?
[03:26] <un_operateur1> are you installing via synaptic?
[03:27] <cole> hi
[03:27] <un_operateur1> sheesh -- aptitude install bacula ...... Need to get 263MB/281MB of archives. After unpacking 731MB will be used.
[03:27] <un_operateur1> forget that
[03:27] <chimai> can anyone tells me if this is proper english?
[03:27] <chimai> "Drown in you immense eyes,
[03:27] <chimai> Once again, i low mines."
[03:27] <chimai> actually, i'm not sure... is it "I low mines" or "I lower mines"?
[03:28] <jrib> chimai: it's not, but this isn't the right channel for that
[03:28] <chimai> true :X
[03:28] <dsnyders> un_operateur1, yes, I am installing via synaptic.
[03:28] <emun> need a burner for iso-image to make alive cd
[03:28] <cole> do you know if wine has ppc support becuase evry time i try it gives me error 404
[03:28] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, n/m -- the problem exists otherwise too
[03:29] <dsnyders> chimai, I lower mine
[03:29] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, if i were to install bacula i'd build it from source
[03:29] <chimai> thx dsnyders :)
[03:30] <FSRxc> Good evening.
[03:30] <dsnyders> un_operateur1, any other backup packages?  I am just backing up from partition to partition on the same machine (different drives)
[03:30] <FSRxc> Can anyone help me with msttcorefonts?
[03:30] <rance> has anyone noticed any changes to the dhcp client in ubuntu, I had a custom dhclient.conf that is no longer being respected on a ubuntu 6.06 LTS server
[03:30] <chimai> yes, what the probleme FSRxc ?
[03:30] <cole> do you know if wine has ppc support becuase evry time i try it gives me error 404
[03:31] <FSRxc> Its a dependency of OpenOffice, so its already installed
[03:31] <dsnyders> chimai, you're welcome.  However this is probably not the best forum for advice on poetry
[03:31] <emun> help help what can use to burn an iso image cd
[03:31] <chimai> i don't think so FSRxc
[03:31] <cole> i know
[03:31] <FSRxc> Now how do I get it to work? OpenOffice ca nuse it but nothing else will (flash sites with msttcorefonts will not display text)
[03:31] <bimberi> cole: it doesn't, wine only runs on i386 (and am64 with some effort)
[03:31] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, there's amanda which is used on redhat/fedora quite ubiquitously
[03:31] <cole> are u useing linux to burn?
[03:31] <cole> or windows
[03:31] <FSRxc> Oh, it "suggests"
[03:31] <chimai> Yup, dsnyders , jrib already yeld me :X
[03:31] <FSRxc> Ok, how do I get it to install?
[03:31] <dsnyders> emun, I use a program called k3b
[03:32] <chimai> apt-get install msttcorefonts FSRxc ;)
[03:32] <emun> thanks so much
[03:32] <FSRxc> Gives an error
[03:32] <dsnyders> un_operateur1, Thanks.  I'll take a look at that one.
[03:32] <MaestroTechie> someone please give me a link to the ubuntu live cd
[03:32] <chimai> it's in the PLF repo
[03:32] <un_operateur1> dsnyders, there's sbackup -- a simple desktop backup tool
[03:32] <MaestroTechie> before i shoot myself.
[03:32] <un_operateur1> which you might like

[03:39] <drivera90> Guys. In this hdd, I'm on the Ubuntu partition, and have Windows on another partition. How do I make Ubuntu see the Windows partition?
[03:40] <eracc> Does anyone here remember the name of a PC game based on Tolkein's Middle Earth (turn based, grid) one could play against computer opponents? This would be a few years old perhaps. I'm trying to find out if there is a port to Linux OR if I played it on Linux. Been a while.
[03:41] <cole> umm sounds familer oh
[03:41] <un_operateur1> Adross,  IIRC -- all you need to do is unrar, and it should do it all for you -- unrar firstfile.rar

[03:53] <Ubotwo> scott__: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:54] <Asc> theilliniguy: You can get the Ubuntu package from here: http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads.php
[03:54] <gouki> theilliniguy: Go to truecrypt.org and select the package for your version (they have for 6.06 and 6.10)
[03:54] <KNY> nzhomie, check http://gaim.sf.net/
[03:54] <nzhomie> cheers
[03:54] <scott__> Ok so its like Compiz ....is Beryl or Compiz better?

[03:55] <timtrimble> con-man, what's up
[03:55] <theilliniguy> .deb
[03:55] <Asc> theilliniguy: I've always compiled it from source myself, so I can't help much with installing it from the package.  The next thing to do will be to extract it from the package - right click the icon and the should be an extract or archive manager option
[03:55] <gouki> theilliniguy: Then extract it and do as I told you before

[04:01] <mga_mark> Hi everyone. I'm getting ready to to the big install, and I was hoping to talk to someone first.
[04:01] <ubuntu_noob> hi, can someone tell me where I can define which kernel modules get automatically loaded at boot? (I need the acerhk module to be loaded)
[04:01] <scott__> Ok on the topic of Xinerama/Twinview, how do I know which monitor is my main one, and how do I know which to fill in in the options Option "UseDisplayDevice" "string" and Option "ConnectedMonitor" "string, string-1"
[04:01] <compilerwriter> Ok people what is the best backup ap out there and why?
[04:01] <Asc> gouki: Does it make you sudo when mounting a volume?  I'm rather attached to not having to
[04:01] <timtrimble> mga_mark, what's up?
[04:01] <scott__> oh, and Option "TwinViewOrientation" "RightOf"    ....what does this do?
[04:01] <gouki> Asc: Yes. It's required sudo to mount a volume
[04:02] <mga_mark> Hi itmtribmble
[04:02] <cole> nortonghost cuz my school uses it like mad
[04:02] <timtrimble> mga_mark, what do you want to talk about?
[04:02] <tonyyarusso> ubuntu_noob: /etc/modules iirc
[04:02] <mga_mark> Anyway, I'm getting ready to install ubuntu. Actually, I'm going to install Kubuntu cause I like the KDE interface better.

[04:03] <FreeNet> hi may I know is there any way to connect to my windows box from my linux box? that is within a same network?
[04:03] <mga_mark> If I just push intstall, is it pretty straightforward and simple?
[04:03] <Asc> FreeNet: What version of windows?
[04:03] <ubuntu_noob> tonyyarusso, ok thanks Ill try that
[04:03] <timtrimble> mga_mark:  yup.
[04:03] <timtrimble> mga_mark:  no confusing steps
[04:03] <tuxplorer> my resolv.conf gets overwritten everytime.. I googled and tried some of the hacks found on ubuntuforum discussion.. but didn't work.. where can I disable resolv.conf being overwritten
[04:04] <FreeNet> Windows XP SP2
[04:04] <mga_mark> So, do I need to make a lot of deciisions along the way, or does it just take care of it while I watch?
[04:04] <tonyyarusso> mga_mark: Should be pretty self-explanatory; only potentially confusing thing is if you want to mess with partitions.
[04:04] <Asc> Freenet: Is it home edition, do you know?
[04:04] <compilerwriter> mga_mark there is a kubuntu channel with a load of people who are experts in just that.  Good luck with the install.
[04:04] <gouki> Asc: Heheh. Dude, you're 1337 :P
[04:04] <FreeNet> Professional
[04:04] <mga_mark> I was going to do a dual boot with Windows, but now I don't think so. Good choice?
[04:05] <compilerwriter> rcrook I wrote scripts back in the dark ages.  Hell, now I am lucky to remember all the shell commands.
[04:05] <timtrimble> mga_mark, it really depends
[04:05] <theilliniguy> asc ok i thought i was doen - but i dont find truecrypt proggy listed anywhere!?
[04:05] <stars> FreeNet, you could use samba on the linux box. it would allow you to have access to files on both machines.
[04:05] <SmoothOp> my torrents aren't working at all
[04:05] <gouki> mga_mark: Its up to you. If you have everything you need running under GNU/Linux there is no reason to pay a license for Windows
[04:05] <Asc> freenet: Then it might be possible.  Home edition seems crippled when it comes to incoming connection from non-windows operating systems
[04:05] <nzhomie> where do i get XML::Parser perl module
[04:05] <tuxplorer> nzhomie: cpan
[04:05] <jrib> nzhomie: apt-cache search lib xml parser perl
[04:06] <rcrook> compilerwriter: lol.. still the easiest for me.
[04:06] <nzhomie> cpan whats that ?
[04:06] <Asc> theilliniguy: Truecrypt is a terminal program.  Start one and use 'man truecrypt' for directions
[04:06] <mga_mark> Also, I can use cross-over if my wife insists on using Microsoft Office, right? Does that work well?
[04:06] <nzhomie> and jrib i am kinda new to linux
[04:06] <nzhomie> what is apt cache?
[04:06] <drivera90> Gah. Why does this website's Verdana font look fatter with Ubuntu?
[04:06] <jrib> !apt | nzhomie
[04:06] <Ubotwo> nzhomie: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[04:06] <FreeNet> nvm guys i manage to get onto the windows box through VNC after connecting to my NX on linux box
[04:06] <nzhomie> yah i know synaptic.
[04:06] <tuxplorer> http://www.cpan.org is a site where you get all perl module.. there is a tool called cpan that can manage the perl modules by gettting them from that site and installing them
[04:07] <nzhomie> what should i search for again ?
[04:07] <jrib> nzhomie: apt-cache search lib xml parser perl
[04:07] <compilerwriter> That leads me to my next question.  I am trying out conversation for the first go.  I have two channels open, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu.  Is there a way to get Konversation to let me know from which channel which lines are coming?
[04:07] <jrib> nzhomie: if you add a -n you'll get only the result you want (-n makes it search pacakge names only)
[04:07] <nzhomie> wuicked thanks guys
[04:07] <cole> i need totem decoders whare do i get them
[04:08] <jrib> nzhomie: apt-get and apt-cache are just comamnd line ways of doing what synaptic does

[04:34] <a33y6o> Hi?
[04:34] <Music_Shuffle> Not really, I personally prefer to check my mail online. ;P
[04:34] <un_operateur1> FluxD, the command to list files in a package -- dpkg -L gnome-panel
[04:35] <FluxD> un_operateur1 I thought it was link to apng file somewhere in usr/share/icons?
[04:35] <nothlit> How do you tell what features/modules are compiled in the default kernel?
[04:36] <un_operateur1> FluxD,  just run  -- dpkg -L gnome-panel
[04:36] <scott__> Ok, Ive got the resolutions to work ....except....it only sets the huge dual screen resolution on one monitor!!! why wont it go across both?!! ARGGGGG
[04:36] <un_operateur1> check the files from that list out
[04:36] <rcrook> nothlit: look at the /boot/config-2.6.17-10-generic
[04:37] <rcrook> or the kernel version you are running
[04:37] <scott__> Can anyone thats knowledgeable on xorg.confs check mine out and see why I can get the 2 monitor resolutions to work but not the 2 monitors itself
[04:37] <un_operateur1> nothlit, lsmod ought to tell you what modules
[04:37] <FluxD> un_operateur1 no png files :(
[04:38] <nothlit> un_operateur1, isn't that only for loaded modules?
[04:38] <rcrook> nothlit: yes
[04:38] <rcrook> the /boot/config file will tell you how the kernel is configured and what modules were compiled
[04:39] <crimson> hey
[04:39] <un_operateur1> nothlit, lsmod is a trivial program which nicely formats the contents of the /proc/modules, showing what kernel modules are currently loaded.
[04:39] <un_operateur1> straight from the manpage
[04:39] <nothlit> rc-1, yeah, i just checked through it, ty for your help :)
[04:39] <arrenlex> Wow, ubotu is STILL gnome?
[04:39] <rcrook> no problems nothlit
[04:39] <arrenlex> What happened to the poor little guy? = /
[04:39] <arrenlex> gnome -> gone o__O
[04:40] <crimson> what's wrong with gnome?
[04:40] <nothlit> ubotu or ubuntu?
[04:40] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[04:40] <nothlit> oh gone rofl
[04:40] <arrenlex> "ubotu is still gone."
[04:40] <nothlit> there ubotwo :)
[04:40] <nothlit> there's
[04:41] <arrenlex> I don't like ubotwo, though. He's like ubotu's creepy little brother with sallow skin who sits in the attic all day doing who knows what on the computer.
[04:41] <arrenlex> little -> big
[04:41] <FluxD> un_operateur1 any other suggestions?
[04:41] <crimson> Quick question
[04:42] <Music_Shuffle> !ask
[04:42] <un_operateur1> FluxD, I assume you have googled enough?
[04:42] <Ubotwo> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:42] <Music_Shuffle> :o
[04:42] <crimson> I just installed Ubuntu, and I want to know, does Ubuntu use DEB packages?
[04:42] <arrenlex> crimson: Yep.
[04:42] <compilerwriter> Yes crinson it does.
[04:42] <regeya> crimson yes
[04:42] <crimson> Ok
[04:42] <Music_Shuffle> Mmhmm.
[04:42] <arrenlex> !deb | crimson
[04:42] <Ubotwo> crimson: deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[04:42] <FluxD> un_operateur1 Tes sir, all of them are for other distro or older version of ubuntu
[04:42] <crimson> So how would I install the JSDK ?
[04:42] <crimson> or JRE ?
[04:42] <arrenlex> !java | crimson
[04:42] <Ubotwo> crimson: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[04:43] <crimson> thanks
[04:43] <bigfuzzyjesus> !botsnack
[04:43] <Ubotwo> Yum!
[04:43] <crimson> hmm, so it's safe to assume that Ubuntu is Debian based, right?
[04:43] <computermc> I'm using a MySQL (version 5) database, and I am using the mysql-admin program to change user information. When ever I try this it just hangs there. Any ideas why this would happen?
[04:43] <bimberi> very
[04:43] <arrenlex> !debian | crimson
[04:43] <Ubotwo> crimson: Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship
[04:44] <hydrogen> hrm
[04:44] <hydrogen> how standards conforming is Ubotwo?
[04:44] <un_operateur1> FluxD, I really have no idea -- if i were running gnome i might be able to help a lil better
[04:44] <hydrogen> !crimson < debian
[04:44] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[04:44] <hydrogen> bah
[04:44] <aliendream23> hello, I am trying to install the latest nvidia drivers (from the websight) onto a dapper drake install, I get an error telling me I need the source files for the kernel so that the installer can compile .... help...?
[04:44] <arrenlex> hydrogen: The syntax for that is !debian > crimson, and it's already been done. :)
[04:44] <jengc0il> nothlit: hi there
[04:45] <hydrogen> arrenlex, no i was seeing how open the bot was to varying ways of doing it
[04:45] <arrenlex> aliendream23: Why are you installing from nvdiia.com?
[04:45] <jengc0il> nothlit: how to check my full ip? wht commnd use
[04:45] <FluxD> un_operateur1 ty np
[04:45] <hydrogen> I wanted to know if I could use here files to send the contents of debian to crimson
[04:45] <jengc0il> !full ip
[04:45] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[04:45] <FluxD> does anyone know how I can change the ubuntu icon in the  menu?
[04:45] <jengc0il> !ip
[04:45] <aliendream23> arrenlex: newer drivers, has an option I want
[04:45] <un_operateur1> FluxD, you could ask arrenlex, he's quite knowledgeable with ubuntu :)
[04:45] <jengc0il> !ifconfig
[04:46] <arrenlex> hydrogen: ...you must annoy your girlfriend.
[04:46] <jengc0il> ping

[04:46] <arrenlex> jengc0il: Do you have a question?
[04:46] <un_operateur1> FluxD, have you tried the procedure here??  http://zool2005.wordpress.com/2006/11/04/changing-main-menu-icon-in-ubuntu/
[04:46] <FluxD> arrenlex does you know how I can change the ubuntu icon in the  menu?
[04:47] <jengc0il> hi arrenlex
[04:47] <arrenlex> FluxD: No; I don't run gnome.
[04:47] <arrenlex> jengc0il: Hello. Please explore the bots in private message or in #ubuntu-bots.
[04:47] <eia768> anyone having problems with  apt-index-watcher ?
[04:47] <jengc0il> 5:24) jengc0il: how to check my full ip? wht commnd use
[04:47] <FluxD> un_operateur1 ty I will try that and let you know
[04:47] <crimson> I'm assuming there is still not a version of LimeWire that works on Ubuntu/Debian, right?
[04:48] <arrenlex> jengc0il: sudo ifconfig
[04:48] <aliendream23> I do not want to use the glx, the nvidia websight has a newer version of the driver
[04:48] <eia768> here cpu usage goes to 60% or more every 5 seconds
[04:48] <jrib> crimson: there has been for a while
[04:48] <jrib> !limewire | crimson
[04:48] <Ubotwo> crimson: limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.
[04:48] <rcrook> crimson: gkt-gnutella is better than limewire
[04:48] <jrib> crimson: I'd recommend frostwire
[04:48] <jrib> or gtk-gnutella, that's good too
[04:48] <jengc0il> arrenlex: full ip withgateway etc
[04:48] <crimson> frostwire huh? I've heard of it just haven't checked it out
[04:49] <Music_Shuffle> !frostwire
[04:49] <Ubotwo> frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[04:49] <FluxD> !gconf
[04:49] <Ubotwo> gconf - GNOME configuration database system. (daemon and tools) - available in Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) - See http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for more information

[04:52] <tuxutug> ok merci

[04:53] <pdiddy_79> thanks music_shuffle
[04:53] <Music_Shuffle> :)
[04:53] <arrenlex> aliendream23: You have to use sudo on both sides of the &&
[04:53] <DaRkNeSS|> eh? :)
[04:53] <arrenlex> aliendream23: sudo apt-get install module-assistant && sudo m-a prepare
[04:53] <aliendream23> right, ok
[04:54] <arrenlex> jengc0il: I don't have much experience with IPs and things. Sorry.
[04:54] <aliendream23> Thank you, going to go give this a try
[04:54] <aliendream23> ...again :)\
[04:56] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, why do you want to view an IPv6 no in decimal?
[04:56] <un_operateur1> s/no/address/
[04:56] <QMario> I receive this window each time I start SaX2: "http://img393.imageshack.us/my.php?image=sax2errormessageqt6.png". What could be the problem?
[04:56] <arrenlex> QMario: That appears to be SuSE.
[04:57] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, good evening
[04:57] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Hiya. :)
[04:58] <a33y6o> Hi
=== a33y6o is now known as LookTJ
[04:58] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, I think I've pretty well established all my lockup problems have been a problem with my wireless device
[04:58] <FluxD> is gconf and gconfig-editor the same thing?
[04:59] <FluxD> un_operateur1 is gconf and gconfig-editor the same thing?
[05:00] <jengc0il> un_operateur1:  mean full ip
[05:00] <un_operateur1> FluxD, I think you need gconfig-editor
[05:00] <jengc0il> or in ubuntu it show in ipv6
[05:00] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Wireless devices are problematic on Linux, yes.
[05:00] <FluxD> un_operateur1 its not showinf up in synaptic
[05:01] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, all IPv6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal -- not just on ubuntu, everywhere
[05:01] <jengc0il> un_operateur1: that i know
[05:01] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, I hooked up an ethernet cable two days ago, and haven't had a problem in 48 hours now
[05:01] <jengc0il> i just want to know my full address
[05:01] <un_operateur1> FluxD, it's a single utility part of some other package -- it wont show up in synaptic
[05:01] <FluxD> Fleebailey33 U can use the driver w/ ndiswrapper
[05:02] <jengc0il> ed in MSDOS ipconfig /all
[05:02] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Good to hear. :) Enjoy your ubuntu.
[05:02] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, that makes it tricky then, well you're trying to run Ubuntu on a notebook computer :)
[05:02] <DaRkNeSS|> anyone know??
[05:02] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Ah. xD
[05:02] <Fleebailey33> not a mac
[05:02] <Fleebailey33> =)
[05:02] <jengc0il> un_operateur1: ?
[05:02] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, ifconfig shows you about IP addressing -- /etc/resolv.conf shows you about dns servers
[05:03] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, if you can't run wireless, kinda removes the whole point in buying the notebook in the first place, obviously :)
[05:03] <jengc0il> un_operateur1: that all i have seen
[05:03] <DaRkNeSS|> I WAS wondering if a linksys wusb54g will work on ubuntu 6.06.1
[05:03] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Does wireless not work at all?
[05:03] <DaRkNeSS|> eh sorry about caps
[05:03] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, so just what are you after?
[05:03] <regeya> Geoffrey2: those poor fools who for years didn't have wireless internet; decades of computer use wasted due to the lack of wireless networking
[05:03] <jengc0il> un_operateur1: any link abt ifconfig or ip
[05:04] <DaRkNeSS|> ubuntu recognizes there is a wireless card there.. but says it isnt configured
[05:04] <igcek_mobi> anybody here?
[05:04] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, I have to know what you're trying to find out before i can be of any useful help to you
[05:04] <kitche> DaRkNeSS|: did you configure it already and it's still saying that?
[05:04] <DaRkNeSS|> i tried configuring it and activating it, but comp freezes when i hit activate
[05:04] <jengc0il> ok un_operateur1
[05:05] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, as long as I am willing to accept having to reboot the computer periodically, it's livable.....though, after all the people saying how much more stable linux is...... (whistles)
[05:05] <J4k3> DaRkNeSS|: is it an atheros-based card?  if so, its madwifi, use the wlanconfig program to configure a logical interface
[05:05] <DaRkNeSS|> i wasnt sure exactly what settings to use as well
[05:05] <DaRkNeSS|> its a linksys wusb54g
[05:05] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, what information are you trying to look for exactly?? same as ipconfig /all??
[05:05] <J4k3> oh, nm
[05:05] <jengc0il> un_operateur1: using adsl modem to konet to internet
[05:05] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: How exactly do you manage to have a laptop that you keep on all the time?
[05:05] <nzhomie> darkness, have you tried ndiswrapper?
[05:05] <DaRkNeSS|> when i hit activate the comp freezes
[05:05] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: If it's plugged in, why not just have ethernet? And if it's not, why waste the battery?
[05:05] <jengc0il> un_operateur1: so i try to make LAN
[05:06] <DaRkNeSS|> i put ubuntu on my laptop
[05:06] <DaRkNeSS|> i wanna put it on my desktop.. but my desktop uses a usb wireless adapter
[05:06] <jengc0il> un_operateur1: so how can i check my host and lan IP
[05:06] <DaRkNeSS|> i wanna make sure it will work before i switch
[05:07] <nzhomie> darkness, try ndiswrapper
[05:07] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, true, as long as it's plugged into the wall, might as well keep it on ethernet...only problem is when I'm on wireless, I'll just have to realize I'll need to manually reestablish a network connection at least once....
[05:07] <DaRkNeSS|> ive heard of ndiswrapper
[05:07] <DaRkNeSS|> where do i download it or w/e
[05:07] <h0ndaracer2> hello everyone
[05:07] <DaRkNeSS|> im basically a comp newb
[05:07] <DaRkNeSS|> even newer to linux
[05:07] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, the IP address of your ethernet adapter is listed in ifconfig -- the public IP address of your gateway should be known if you go to www.whatismyip.com
[05:08] <h0ndaracer2> lol so am i
[05:08] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, like I said, it's livable....annoying, but nothing I can't deal with
[05:08] <hola> ola
[05:08] <un_operateur1> !es
[05:08] <Ubotwo> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[05:08] <DaRkNeSS|> when i was trying to configure it
[05:08] <hola> komo t llamas?
[05:08] <kitche> DaRkNeSS| it's a prisim card ndiswrapper works fine with it it should be installed by default in ubuntu open up a terminal/consoel and do sudo ndiswrapper -l and see if it says driver present hardware present
[05:08] <malt> what file does ubuntu store all its boot commands at? like startup
[05:08] <DaRkNeSS|> should i set it to dhcp or put in the ip
[05:09] <hola> kien es ktchen?
[05:09] <nzhomie> darkness, depeneds on your router. do all your computers get ip adresses automatically from the router or are they set
[05:09] <h0ndaracer2> hey i installed multiple plugins on here but i still can view videos online like mainly the ones i upploaded to photobucket how do i fix it to where i can view it
[05:09] <Shaezsche> does reiserfs boot faster than ext3
[05:09] <kitche> DaRkNeSS| you can do either way but if you use dhcp use that
[05:10] <arrenlex> h0ndaracer2: "can" -> "can't"? If so, I believe photobucket uses flash.
[05:10] <arrenlex> !flash 9 | h0ndaracer2
[05:10] <Ubotwo> h0ndaracer2: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports

[05:10] <Anpheus> Hello.
[05:10] <arrenlex> !hi
[05:10] <Ubotwo> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[05:10] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, now, one of these days I'd REALLY like to get flash 9 working on this....but so far that's just not happening
[05:11] <DaRkNeSS|> when i do that
[05:11] <DaRkNeSS|> it asks for my password
[05:11] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Why?
[05:11] <jbroome> ahh new bot.  my mind is blown
[05:11] <DaRkNeSS|> and when  itry to type it
[05:11] <DaRkNeSS|> it wont let me lol
[05:11] <arrenlex> !enter | DaRkNeSS|
[05:11] <Ubotwo> DaRkNeSS|: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[05:11] <h0ndaracer2> well what are backports? that the bot was talking about
[05:11] <DaRkNeSS|> sorry trying to use more space so people would see it
[05:11] <arrenlex> jbroome: Ubotu DIED :(
[05:11] <DaRkNeSS|> !enter arrenlex
[05:11] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[05:11] <arrenlex> DaRkNeSS|: Don't. It's very annoying.
[05:11] <jbroome> we'll miss you ubotu
[05:11] <malt> does anyone know where ubuntu stores all its startup stuff at services? for example to apache2 to auto boot on os startup
[05:11] <kitche> DaRkNeSS| what do you mean it won't let you if you do sudo it won't show up as you are typing it since echo is off
[05:12] <malt> I ment example for*
[05:12] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, for some reason, I just can't get anything flash to load at all when using flash 9
[05:12] <kitche> malt: /etc/init.d/ is one spot
[05:12] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Is it installed right now?
[05:12] <Asc> Is beryl a window manager or a desktop environment?  Will feisty still use GNOME?
[05:12] <jengc0il> tq un_operateur1
[05:12] <arrenlex> Asc: WM, and yes.
[05:12] <un_operateur1> jengc0il, yw
[05:13] <kootaphor> I've got a box with some unknown version of ubuntu and a broken X server, no cd-rom, but I do have a command-line and a  connection to the 'net--Can I somehow automagically update/install to the newest version?
[05:13] <kitche> Asc: beryl is best used with kde/gnome/xfce it's not good by itself
[05:13] <arrenlex> !upgrade | kootaphor
[05:13] <Ubotwo> kootaphor: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:13] <Anpheus> Ubuntu 6.10 destroyed my Windows XP MBR, and apparently somehow damaged the XP boot process on the drive when I installed it (GRUB will not load it under any number of settings.) All is not lost, as my partition with most of the data is still operational. All I want to do is back up my Windows XP registry so that I may reinstall the Windows partition, how can I do that?
[05:13] <Shaezsche> does reiserfs boot faster than ext3
[05:13] <h0ndaracer2> how do i go about getting flash9 plugin for my mozilla browser
[05:14] <wasabi_> Anpheus: Ubuntu will not touch partitions unless you instruct it to.
[05:14] <malt> kitche: so all apps names in /etc/init.d/ is what all starts on linux os startup?
[05:14] <wasabi_> Are you sure you are booting it properly?
[05:14] <kitche> Shaezsche: not really
[05:14] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Define "not load".
[05:14] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Blank screen? Error message?
[05:14] <kitche> malt if they are chmod +x they will start up on boot
[05:14] <Asc> kitche, arrenlex: Excellent, thanks.  Will other window managers work with it at all?  e.x. ion3, enlightenment, which could have difficulties fitting on a cube?
[05:15] <Anpheus> Well, the BIOS for a while would just say "No Boot Device, Press F1 to retry ..." if I uninstalled GRUB.
[05:15] <arrenlex> Asc: How do you propose to run two window managers at the same time, exactly?
[05:15] <kitche> Asc: well Beryl is a window manager so no it can't work with other window managers
[05:15] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, I've got the plugin yes, but I renamed it so Firefox wouldn't try to load it...right now I'm back to Flash 7
[05:15] <Anpheus> fixboot and fixmbr did not work on Windows XP either.
[05:15] <arrenlex> Anpheus: I meant, with grub installed.
[05:15] <Anpheus> Edgy didn't detect it for whatever reason. I had to manually add the entry.
[05:16] <Asc> arrenlex: Good point.  I'm still a little hazy on the exact definition of a window manager.
[05:16] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Rename it back please, and move flash 7 (the so and xpt) out of the plugins folder. Restart firefox. Pastebin the output of "about:plugins"
[05:16] <Anpheus> But... if I recall, GRUB would announce an error and then tell me to press escape to continue.
[05:17] <arrenlex> Asc: Window manager draws the titlebar at the top (with the _ o x) buttons. Window managers decide where windows are. Window managers move, maximise, minimise, restore, scale, tile, animate windows. Manage them, if you will.
[05:17] <DaRkNeSS|> it said ndiswrapper was not a command
[05:17] <arrenlex> Asc: Desktop environments provide a consistent user interface, configuration utilities, a desktop, an API, and applications. An environment, if you will, to work in. Upon a desktop.
[05:17] <Asc> arrenlex: *in a fake sneaky tone* But you can't run a window manager *under another window manager*?
[05:17] <kitche> Anpheus: to save the registry it will be hard since you need a special cd like a bartPE cd with some special tools on it
[05:17] <arrenlex> Asc: Any desktop environment can be used with any window manager, and vice versa.
[05:18] <malt> kitche: what should i chmod it to for it not to auto start?
[05:18] <PORDO> anyone know of a PDF viewer that will let me "write" on the pdf?
[05:18] <malt> kitche chmod -x file?
[05:18] <kitche> mail : sudo chmod -x <file>
[05:18] <Anpheus> Ok, can anyone help me back up the registry then?
[05:18] <arrenlex> Asc: *gravely* No. But the best minds of the nation are working at it.
[05:18] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, ok, in usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree....
[05:18] <wasabi_> Anpheus: You can't back up a windows registry without, being in windows.
[05:18] <niru> hello all
[05:18] <Asc> arrenlex, I sense that you've had the opportunity to make that distinction before ;p
[05:18] <kitche> mail/malt
[05:19] <arrenlex> Anpheus: I tried backing up my registry once. It will not work to just install a fresh windows and put the registry back. It will not boot.
[05:19] <DaRkNeSS|> is 6.06.1 better or 6.10
[05:19] <wasabi_> And I seriously doubt restoring the registry is going to give you a usable system.
[05:19] <wasabi_> What arrenlex said
[05:19] <niru> Has any body worked on keyjnote
[05:19] <wasabi_> A windows systems "settings" are scattered between the registry, and files in every part of C:... WIndows, program files, common files.
[05:19] <arrenlex> niru: Tranglos Keynote? Yes.
[05:20] <niru> arrenlex:yes its a presentation tool
[05:20] <Anpheus> Why is that? I had separated my program data and Windows boot, my Windows boot was up to date with updates just two days ago.
[05:20] <Anpheus> The sooner I get Windows to work again, the fewer differences between fully updated systems.
[05:20] <arrenlex> niru: Oh. Do you mean apple keynote?
[05:20] <niru> arrenlex:what is Tranglos
[05:20] <Anpheus> See, I have access to all of those files.
[05:20] <arrenlex> niru: There are many applications called "keynote".
[05:20] <Geoffrey2> DaRkNeSS|, 6.06.1 is just 6.06 with a bunch of updates installed, so you don't need to download 300+ files once 6.06 is installed :)
[05:20] <niru> arrenlex:not keynote I told keyjnote
[05:20] <wiseelben> Is there a way to transfer your buddies from one screename to another (AIM)? GAIM doesn't support exporting/importing contacts so I have to figure out another way.
[05:20] <Anpheus> I've mounted the partition already, I just need to know how to back up the Registry.
[05:21] <h0ndaracer2> im starting to get the hang of linux
[05:21] <gansinho> please, where may I find repositories to install nvidia 9640 beta drivers or above?
[05:21] <wasabi_> Anpheus: You run ntbackup.
[05:21] <Music_Shuffle> h0ndaracer2, or so you THINK! :o
[05:21] <niru> arrenlex:I saw somewhere that ubuntu uses keyjnote
[05:21] <wasabi_> Also, if you have access to C:\WINDOWS< what's your problem?
[05:21] <arrenlex> niru: Never heard of keyjnote. I assumed it was a typo.
[05:21] <Music_Shuffle> wiseelben, there is if you...get on AIM, export from one to the other, then login on gaim as the second I guess.
[05:21] <wasabi_> That's the C drive.
[05:21] <wasabi_> If it works, you're golden.
[05:21] <h0ndaracer2> im getting their and ive done alot of reading and devoted way to much time lol
[05:22] <Spaghetti_Knife> Hi, anyone use snes9express?
[05:22] <h0ndaracer2> i got a lot of my stuff fixed
[05:22] <Music_Shuffle> XD
[05:22] <BandWitdH> Anyone good with ethereal ?
[05:22] <Anpheus> Wasabi, the problem is that the Windows XP boot... whatever process that GRUB passes on to that partition, was destroyed when Ubuntu modified the partition table.
[05:22] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, what is the pastebin address?
[05:22] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anybody use snes9express?
[05:22] <wasabi_> that partition has WINDOWS on it.
[05:22] <wiseelben> Music_Shuffle: as in running the AIM client in windows, rgiht?
[05:22] <Anpheus> Yes, yes it does.
[05:23] <wasabi_> So, you lost WINDOWS?
[05:23] <Anpheus> But it doesn't BOOT.
[05:23] <Music_Shuffle> wiseelben, unfortunately, yes.
[05:23] <wasabi_> Then just repair the MBR
[05:23] <Music_Shuffle> Both on the count of Windows, and AIM. Lol.
[05:23] <arrenlex> !pastebin | Geoffrey2
[05:23] <Spaghetti_Knife> I can't map the keyboard.
[05:23] <Ubotwo> Geoffrey2: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:23] <wasabi_> what does the registry have to do with that?
[05:23] <Anpheus> Didn't work.
[05:23] <Anpheus> I have attempted to restore it with the fixboot / fixmbr tools. All those did was remove grub.
[05:23] <|thunder> "It goal is to: "run Gtk+ applications without X11 on Mac OS X".     wow
[05:23] <Anpheus> So I want to reinstall Windows
[05:23] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anybody play emulators? Can anybody help me with it?
[05:23] <Anpheus> and restore the registry.
[05:23] <Anpheus> That's all.
[05:23] <arrenlex> Anpheus: What did GRUB say when you tried to boot windows, though?
[05:23] <wasabi_> Well, enjoy. Heh.
[05:23] <Anpheus> It gave me an error, told me to press escape, and I had to choose Ubuntu.
[05:23] <arrenlex> Anpheus: "an error"?
[05:24] <wasabi_> If hte windows parittion is in tact, you can just fix the MBR and it'll be fine.
[05:24] <kitche> Anpheus: when you restor the registry you will have many errors on boot due to what your other windows had on it at boot that your new windows won't have
[05:24] <Anpheus> Ok, well, tell me how to fix the MBR if 'fixmbr' doesn't work?
[05:24] <wiseelben> Music_Shuffle: oh well.. time to boot windows -_-
[05:24] <Music_Shuffle> wiseelben, I'm sorry. =[
[05:24] <kitche> AnpheusL did the error have a number in it? and do you remember it
[05:24] <Anpheus> Kitche, what will my new windows _not have_?! I have ALL of the program data, drivers, etc, backed up.
[05:24] <Anpheus> No, I don't.
[05:24] <niru> how do you convert a .ppt file to a pdf format file
[05:24] <wasabi_> Anpheus: Does fixmbr restore the windows MBR?
[05:24] <Anpheus> No, it did not.
[05:25] <niru> I need some command line method
[05:25] <ronin3> Anpheus: can't you just boot from the windowze install cd and go into repair mode to fix the mbr?
[05:25] <arrenlex> niru: Open it in openoffice impress and save it as a pdf.
[05:25] <Anpheus> It removed GRUB, which I had to setup again with the Live CD.
[05:25] <niru> instead of coding
[05:25] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anybody play snes9express?
[05:25] <wasabi_> Are you pointing it at the right drive?
[05:25] <Anpheus> I went into repair mode, fixmbr did not work.
[05:25] <Spaghetti_Knife> I need help with changing the interface.
[05:25] <Anpheus> Yes, I am.
[05:25] <arrenlex> Anpheus: ronin3 has a very good idea. Use the repair mode on the Windows install CD. You won't lose your files\settings that way.
[05:25] <Anpheus> I DID.
[05:26] <Music_Shuffle> Well, that'll rip up GRUB, won't it?
[05:26] <Anpheus> It did!
[05:26] <wasabi_> So what do you want? Windows support?
[05:26] <arrenlex> Anpheus: No, no. You went into the recovery console.
[05:26] <Anpheus> I had to use the Live CD to restore it.
[05:26] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, ok, here's the pastebin of my about:plugins   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37686/
[05:26] <Anpheus> Oh, yes.
[05:26] <arrenlex> Anpheus: I am talking about the repair INSTALL.
[05:26] <Anpheus> The repair mode doesn't acknowledge the existence of the windows partition.
[05:26] <h0ndaracer2> i got a quick question how come when you install stuff in windows your usually required restart as on linux you dont have to unless its sometin major
[05:26] <Anpheus> For whatever reason.
[05:26] <arrenlex> ... o__O
[05:26] <Anpheus> Linux will mount it.
[05:26] <Anpheus> Windows Install CD thinks it's unformatted.
[05:26] <wasabi_> h0ndaracer2: Mandatory file locks.
[05:26] <wasabi_> h0ndaracer2: And basically just smarter package management.
[05:26] <Music_Shuffle> Install windows --> make a partition --> intall ubuntu on the part.
[05:26] <Music_Shuffle> s/intall/install
[05:27] <Music_Shuffle> Simple enough, no?
[05:27] <bulmer> hello, anyone got a ACX111 54MBPs wifi card on a desktop working ?
[05:27] <h0ndaracer2> ic
[05:27] <ronin3> Anpheus: you try booting with a knoppix cd to see if knoppix can see the windowze partition? (reads ntfs and fat32)
[05:27] <wasabi_> Hey, too many chefs.
[05:27] <Anpheus> I can read it in Ubuntu.
[05:27] <h0ndaracer2> why dont windows use the way linux does then
[05:27] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Should work. Does it not?
[05:27] <Anpheus> I have it mounted _right now_.
[05:27] <ronin3> Anpheus: if knoppix can't see it, you are probably boned
[05:27] <wasabi_> If ya'll would just read the entire conversation, you could stop this crap.
[05:27] <ronin3> oh nm
[05:27] <ronin3> that requires using the evil page up key
[05:27] <wasabi_> Anpheus: I do not believe you CAN backup the windows registry without booting into windows.
[05:27] <wasabi_> Anpheus: So that idea is pretty much a no-go.
[05:27] <Anpheus> Guys, I have my Windows NTFS partition_S_ mounted. That's PLURAL.
[05:27] <wasabi_> Anpheus: Unless you know something I don't.
[05:28] <Anpheus> Ok, hypothetically speaking
[05:28] <Anpheus> If I back up that partition entirely
[05:28] <fr500_> is the SuSe panel available for ubuntu
[05:28] <Nico777> Hello folks i got a problem with my xchat grade icons : since I updated to xchat 2.6.8 the icons vanished in the air. Is it a well known issue ? I use ubuntu dapper with a 2.6.17 kernel and will marry within an hour anyone who could solve this :)
[05:28] <wasabi_> Anpheus: If you believe your partition table is trashed, you might start by backing up the partition, using ntfsclone.
[05:28] <wasabi_> Remake the table.
[05:28] <wasabi_> Then restoring hte partition.
[05:28] <Anpheus> and then reinstall Windows, and copy over the backup, will it work?
[05:28] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, ok, just try loading up anything in particular flash related, I suppose?
[05:28] <wasabi_> Might, you might not need to reinstall windows.
[05:28] <Guss> what should i do si i could run DVD movies on Xubuntu ?
[05:28] <wasabi_> Just use ntfsclone to pull an image of the NTFS system, redo the partition tables, then put it back, then try fixmbr again
[05:28] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: homestarrunner.com :)
=== BandWitdH is now known as phiber
[05:29] <Anpheus> Ok, well, for the sake of speeding this along, perhaps, I'm going to add the Windows partition to GRUB again and tell you guys my errors.
=== phiber is now known as dellthinker
[05:29] <bulmer> hello, anyone got a ACX111 54MBPs wifi card on a desktop working ?
[05:29] <wasabi_> I don't really see why windows wouldn't boot with grub, unless it's not hte first partition or something.
[05:30] <wasabi_> s/with/without
[05:30] <h0ndaracer2> whats edubuntu?
[05:30] <arrenlex> !edubuntu | h0ndaracer2
[05:30] <Ubotwo> h0ndaracer2: Edubuntu is an Ubuntu derivative aimed at schools and educational institutions. For more info, see http://www.edubuntu.org
[05:30] <Anpheus> well, I don't know why it isn't either.
[05:30] <h0ndaracer2> ic
[05:30] <dellthinker> Does anyone have any knowlege with Ethereal ?
[05:30] <h0ndaracer2> thats how you get the bot to respond to you
[05:30] <h0ndaracer2> i didnt know how
[05:30] <Guss> what should i do so i could see DVD movies on my Xubuntu ?
[05:30] <Dial_tone> looks like the new nano's aren't recognized by linux yet
[05:31] <fran1> I know a little about ethereal...
[05:31] <b33nr00ted> Guss: google it:P
[05:31] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anybody play snes9express?
[05:31] <dellthinker> fran1 - kool can you help me?
[05:31] <h0ndaracer2> what are some good forumns to go to that talks about linux
[05:31] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anybody know the irc channel for it?
[05:31] <Guss> :( ok sorry
[05:31] <fran1> sure I can try!
[05:31] <kitche> Dial_tone: well they are just flash drives so they probably are just that it's a bit different
[05:31] <bretzel> hi there, just installed ubuntu edgy on Toshiba satellite with Intel 945 displ.  - enabled gl with compiz. -- cannot switch desktops
[05:31] <b33nr00ted> h0ndaracer2: what distro?
[05:31] <h0ndaracer2> ubuntu
[05:31] <dellthinker> fran1 - im trying to analyze the packets from all the nodes on my network
[05:32] <b33nr00ted> h0ndaracer2: ubuntuguide
[05:32] <Anpheus> I'll be back.
[05:32] <dellthinker> i have a linksys wireless router with 2 servers and 3 laptops connected
[05:32] <b33nr00ted> http://ubuntuguide.org
[05:32] <malt> Hello, I'm running a linux server with apache2, and i upload some images, and my apache2 server is not opening bmp files like it does the rest of the images. It ask if you want to download the bmp image, what could be wrong with my apache server?
[05:32] <dellthinker> Problem is, im only getting the traffic from my laptop
[05:32] <h0ndaracer2> ok thanks
[05:32] <dellthinker> I want to be able to monitor everything
[05:32] <wasabi_> malt: Nothing to do with apache.
[05:32] <dellthinker> fran1 - following so far?
[05:32] <wasabi_> malt: Configure your client to auto open bmps
[05:32] <fran1> yep
[05:33] <vcef> hi
[05:33] <fran1> so have you set the option to capture in promiscious mode?
[05:33] <dellthinker> I have it running now
[05:33] <malt> wasabi_: no its not my client, it does this to other people, and i open bmp images
[05:33] <kitche> malt: clients can't understand bmp format
[05:33] <malt> with my client
[05:33] <b33nr00ted> malt: change them to jpg's:)
[05:33] <vcef> I've nvidia binary drivers installed on edgy and I wonder if I can safely run hibernate
[05:33] <dellthinker> fran1 - I dont think so, let me check
[05:33] <dellthinker> fran1 - does that option allow me to monitor my entire network
[05:33] <dellthinker> ?
[05:33] <fran1> its under the menu -> capture -> option
[05:33] <vcef> cause last time I tried (different distro, several years back) software suspend just freezed
[05:34] <fran1> yep, it will mean that ethereal will capture all ethernet packets that go past your nic
[05:34] <fran1> so in effect you should see everyting on your subnet
[05:34] <ReWT_AxS> anyone here use edgy and automatix?
[05:35] <vcef> !hibernate
[05:35] <Ubotwo> hibernate - smartly puts your computer to sleep (suspend to RAM or disk) - available in Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) - See http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for more information
[05:35] <lovloss> I was trying to render something in blender using yafray and it just sits there, so i wen to the site to see if i could just download yafray seperate... here are the different linux versions they cover: http://www.yafray.org/index.php?s=2
[05:35] <ReWT_AxS> !automatix
[05:35] <Ubotwo> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:35] <lovloss> Which one works best?
[05:36] <vcef> !suspend
[05:36] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[05:36] <civilwest> I Love Ubuntu! Wish I had it 10 years ago!
[05:36] <fran1> Anyone know what I need to add to my grub.conf to get an old fedora box to offer the option of booting into a fresh ubuntu edgy install?
[05:37] <dellthinker> hmmm....
[05:37] <civilwest> I'm still learning....sorry...can't help..
[05:37] <b33nr00ted> fran1: u dont wanna format?
[05:37] <lovloss> Does ubuntu have  "openexr support"??
[05:37] <mzuverink> Where is the appropriate place to post beryl questions?
[05:37] <fran1> nope, I'm keeping the FC4 partition alive until I migrate over to ubuntu edgy
[05:37] <lovloss> #beryl
[05:38] <fran1> its my mythtv media server
[05:38] <mzuverink> thank you kind person
[05:38] <lovloss> :)
[05:38] <lovloss> Nobody casn help me? :(
[05:38] <b33nr00ted> sorry cant help:S
[05:38] <b33nr00ted> (L)
[05:38] <lovloss> I want yafray to work, but it only has packages for rpm and debian
[05:39] <holy_cow> lovloss, what are you talking about
[05:39] <b33nr00ted> they dont have tars?
[05:39] <holy_cow> yafray is in ubuntu repos too
[05:39] <holy_cow> whats wrong with you?
[05:39] <b33nr00ted> debian is close to ubuntu
[05:39] <lovloss> i didnt see it in the options...
[05:39] <holy_cow> lovloss, no biggie :)
[05:39] <lovloss> :( it is. why isnt it in add/remove programs?
[05:39] <bulmer> using iwconfig wlan0  shows its up and it has the ESSID but AP is not associated, using iwlist wlan0 scan shows No scan results..how do I activate to let it scan so it can associate?
[05:40] <holy_cow> make sure you enable all the repos via system / admin  / software sources
[05:40] <arrenlex> lovloss: apt-get install yafray
[05:40] <holy_cow> than search for it
[05:40] <lovloss> It was in the app-cache, but it wasnt in the add/remove gui
[05:40] <holy_cow> sudo apt-get intall yafray
[05:40] <Bakefy> is there a program out there that will stream a tv tuner station over the internet?
[05:40] <b33nr00ted> ^^ install he means:)
[05:41] <dellthinker> Bakefy: yep.
[05:41] <lovloss> thanks guys, lol :)
[05:41] <Bakefy> dellthinker, how much work is it to set up?
[05:41] <b33nr00ted> http://www.netfor2.com/
[05:41] <lovloss> yay its faster than blender's renderer
[05:41] <fran1> Bakefy: - you could try vlc, working from the device that is a capture card
[05:42] <fran1> or mythtv with the unofficial mythstreamtv option.
[05:42] <arrenlex> lovloss: That is very surprising. In theory yafray should be slower.
[05:42] <arrenlex> lovloss: But better-quality.
[05:42] <Bakefy> fran1, will that stream to windows?
[05:42] <fran1> yep
[05:42] <b33nr00ted> yes
[05:42] <lovloss> arrenlex: I know... but its faster than the blender internal
[05:42] <lovloss> at least for me
[05:42] <Bakefy> thats so cool!
[05:42] <fran1> it will do mms or http stream
[05:42] <Anpheus> Back.
[05:42] <Anpheus> Did another fixmbr on the Windows partition, did nothing.
[05:42] <arrenlex> Anpheus: I wanted to say: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_registry#Registry_locations
[05:42] <fran1> I've used mms and had it work well in the past
[05:42] <lovloss> Maybe my computer isnt handling the internal renderer right, its very slow. Sometimes a short animation can take 3 hours
[05:43] <lovloss> by short i mean 10 seconds or less :(
[05:43] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Not fixmbr. Grub. Add it to grub.
[05:43] <Anpheus> Yeah, I added it to grub.
[05:43] <Anpheus> The GRUB errors are for (hd0,2), (hd0,1) and (hd0,0) are 22, 13, and 12 respectively.
[05:43] <Anpheus> Just in case I added a couple extra entries to GRUB.
[05:43] <arrenlex> Anpheus: What's the output of "sudo fdisk -l"?
[05:43] <lovloss> oh well. bye bye
[05:44] <Anpheus> /dev/sda1               2        7687    61737795    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)

[05:44] <fran1> So.... I'm trying to get grub to boot this edgy partition, but upon boot, I get "Error 17: Cannot mount the selected partition"... I think its from grub

[05:44] <Anpheus> It's on /dev/sda5
[05:44] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Then you should be using (hd0,4).
[05:45] <fran1> Bakefy - nope, you've gotta install mythstreamtv google for it, its an unsupported plugin for mythtv.
[05:45] <arrenlex> Anpheus: ...it's not on an extended partition, is it? I don't think windows can handle that.
[05:45] <b33nr00ted> fran1: yes it is grub
[05:45] <Anpheus> That's what Edgy did when I installed it.
[05:45] <fran1> my grub.conf on the FC4 side has this in it:
[05:45] <Anpheus> It did this wacky stupid default install with the empty space
[05:45] <Russell-> where can i find the ubuntu repository DVD?
[05:45] <fran1>         root (hd2,0)
[05:45] <fran1>         kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hde1 ro quiet splash
[05:45] <fran1>         initrd /initrd.img
[05:45] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Regardless, try (hd0,4) and see what happens.
[05:45] <Bakefy> fran1, but this works on vlc?
[05:45] <bimberi> !dvdiso | Russell-
[05:45] <Ubotwo> Russell-: DVD ISOs are available via http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/
[05:45] <dfgas> ls
[05:46] <dfgas> bah
[05:46] <dfgas> hello
[05:46] <fran1> Bakefy - yep its using vlc player under the covers
[05:46] <arrenlex> xD
[05:46] <emun> need some help, how do install a package I have downloaded in the form of  ....tar.gz  sitting on my desktop. what commands do I use to istall
[05:46] <fran1> and its all standard stuff from vlcplayer
[05:46] <Anpheus> and it did this: It put my Windows C:\ and D:\ in an extended partition AND put a swap partition in that extended partition, and then it added a second regular partition with root.
[05:46] <Anpheus> But I'll try it, brb.
[05:46] <Pelo> Russell-,  it's easier to get with torrents,  look for it here www.torrentz.com   search for  ubuntu 6.10  dvd
[05:46] <arrenlex> dfgas: heart lungs brain leg_l leg_r arm_l arm_r
[05:46] <dfgas> ok, i changed drives and cdroms over to a new mobo and proc, with all the cards on 6.10
[05:46] <dfgas> now the sound card don't work
[05:46] <dfgas> it shows up in lsmod
[05:46] <dfgas> any ideas?
[05:47] <arrenlex> dfgas: http://arrenlex.diff.be/alsaconf <--- what happens if you run this script? It's from the debian alsa-utils package.
[05:47] <malt> anyone know the command to search ubuntu system for a file name?
[05:47] <Russell-> bimberi and Pelo: actually i'm looking for the repository DVDs... main, multiverse and universe... ar they available?
[05:47] <bulmer> malt  find
[05:47] <arrenlex> malt: find <path> -name "<name>"
[05:47] <b33nr00ted> find
[05:47] <b33nr00ted> or whereis u can find some stuff with too
[05:47] <bimberi> Russell-: ah, not sure sorry
[05:47] <Pelo> Russell-,  I beleive all the packages are available on the dvd
[05:48] <fran1> so grub is complaining that the filesystem is unknown... could this be because the grub from FC4 cannot recogonize the ubuntu edgy eft root filesystem (ext3 methinks?)
[05:48] <sartan> Has anyone here tried to compile the cvs version of cedega and succeeded under 6.10?  I'm having problems with flex (lex)
[05:48] <emun> how do I install tar,gz packages downloaded to my desktop
[05:48] <civilwest> Malt are u in terminal?
[05:48] <DaRkNeSS|> anyone here who could help me in a pm?
[05:48] <bimberi> emun: what package?
[05:48] <malt> civilwestyes ssh
[05:48] <malt> civilwest yes ssh
[05:48] <arrenlex> emun: .tar.gz packages are archives, like .zip files. You must exract them first.
[05:48] <sartan> i've tried flex and flex-old to compile cedega from cvs for ubuntu and each don't really appear to be 'workrking'
[05:48] <bimberi> !compiling | emun
[05:48] <Ubotwo> emun: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[05:48] <arrenlex> emun: Typically .tar.gz is used for distributing source.
[05:48] <Russell-> bimberi and Pelo: check this out please: http://www.thelinuxstore.ca/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1113
[05:49] <Pelo> DaRkNeSS|,  we do it better in public, that way other ppl can help if they have a clue
[05:49] <emun> it is the streamripper
[05:49] <andy__> Hola!
[05:49] <arrenlex> !hi
[05:49] <Ubotwo> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[05:49] <Anpheus> K, for (hd0,5) and (hd0,4) it said no partition, for (hd0,3) it said it invalid. Errors 22, 22, and 12 I believe.
[05:49] <andy__> HOla
[05:49] <andy__> Hola!
[05:49] <andy__> HOla!
[05:49] <andy__> hey!
[05:49] <jbroome> stab
[05:50] <arrenlex> ...
[05:50] <b33nr00ted> :-P
[05:50] <Pelo> Russell-,   I doubt very much it is 6 dvds,  the whole package is 6 cd or 1 dvd
[05:50] <Anpheus> Right.
[05:50] <Anpheus> Listen, you said earlier that you don't know if Windows can boot within an extended partition.
[05:50] <Anpheus> Is that true?
[05:50] <bimberi> Russell-: cool.  I note that it claims "Available exclusively"
[05:51] <Anpheus> Because that's what Edgy set my partitions as when I installed it.
[05:51] <r_> does anyone know of a program I can use to record audio output?
[05:51] <emun> bimberi, any help, I will compiling page though
[05:51] <Anpheus> I stupidly, stupidly told it to use the free space I set aside for it, and it ended up screwing with the partition table for C:\ and D:\ in Windows.
[05:51] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Yes. Look:
[05:51] <bimberi> emun: pardon?
[05:51] <Russell-> bimberi and Pelo: ok thanks
[05:51] <gansinho> please, how do I kill X server in ubuntu
[05:51] <arrenlex> Anpheus: This problem's person looks just like yours: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=debian-user&m=114050131631508&w=2
[05:52] <arrenlex> Anpheus: And this answer confirms what I said: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=debian-user&m=114051333731655&w=2
[05:52] <Russell-> bimberi and Pelo: just another link: http://cargol.net/~ramon/ubuntu-dvd-en#AEN25
[05:52] <bulmer> gansinho  ctrl+alt+backspace
[05:52] <Music_Shuffle> gansinho, alt+ctrl+bkspce
[05:52] <Russell-> bimberi and Pelo: i'm a bit confused
[05:52] <fran1> gansinho - try CTRL+ALT+Backspace
[05:52] <bulmer> using iwconfig wlan0  shows its up and it has the ESSID but AP is not associated, using iwlist wlan0 scan shows No scan results..how do I activate to let it scan so it can associate?
[05:52] <gansinho> bulmer: this will reboot it, I need to turn it off, to install nvidia beta drivers...
[05:52] <emun> I was trying to see whether there is a standard set of commands
[05:53] <gansinho> I'm in cmdline now... tryikng to kill it
[05:53] <bulmer> gansinho: come again? everyone repeate it
[05:53] <Pelo> Russell-,  so am I now
[05:53] <Anpheus> Ok, so... Edgy screwed with Windows XP contrary to what someone said earlier by putting it in an extended partition.
[05:53] <Anpheus> How can I change that?
[05:53] <arrenlex> Does anyone know if it is possible to use gparted to copy partitions?
[05:54] <b33nr00ted> anpheus: are u trying to use windows and ubuntu together?
[05:54] <Anpheus> Yes.
[05:54] <bimberi> Russell-: perhaps not so exclusive now :) . What's confusing you?
[05:54] <b33nr00ted> anpheus: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6104490811311898236
[05:54] <bulmer> Anpheus: i use vmware first, and installed the guest xp on the vmware
[05:54] <b33nr00ted> there is a video on how to do it
[05:54] <Anpheus> ...
[05:54] <pr3d4t0r> Greetings again.
[05:54] <Anpheus> No, I'm sorry, I mean dual boot.
[05:54] <arrenlex> b33nr00ted: I don't think that's helpful at this point.
[05:55] <Anpheus> See, my Windows XP boot is utterly gone.
[05:55] <Anpheus> Like, trashed.
[05:55] <conic> bulmer, how do i shut down all these vmware services i don't need
[05:55] <b33nr00ted> oh,.,
[05:55] <Anpheus> It... the partition exists.
[05:55] <b33nr00ted> sorry i wasnt paying attention till now:P
[05:55] <dellthinker> Anpheus - that happens
[05:55] <Anpheus> But Windows Recovery Console ignores its existence.
[05:55] <Anpheus> I can boot into the partition with Recovery Console
[05:55] <Anpheus> but all the utilities, they don't do anything
[05:55] <civilwest> Best to unplug your "winders" hard drive and install linux on seperat hard drive....I got tired of it screwn me up too!
[05:55] <bulmer> conic: i dont know..i only have one vmware running..i dont understand what you meant by all these vmware services
[05:55] <Anpheus> probably because, like arrenlex said, Edgy incorrectly changed my partition table.
[05:55] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Recovery console and any of the standard windows will not do you any good at this point.
[05:56] <Anpheus> Yeah, I thought so.
[05:56] <gansinho> bulmer: ctrl+alt+del isn't killing my X server... I need to kill it... shutdown completely
[05:56] <b33nr00ted> umm
[05:56] <dellthinker> Anpheus - let this be a lesson that partitioning sux :D
[05:56] <J4k3> gansinho: try crlt-alt-f1
[05:56] <Anpheus> Yeah, I know.
[05:56] <bulmer> gansinho: shutdown completely? okay  shutdown -h now
[05:56] <Anpheus> So, to solve my problem I need to make what is currently /dev/sda5 a primary partition.
[05:56] <b33nr00ted> gansinho: go to ur processes and kill it manuyally
[05:56] <conic> well vmware has services running such as dhcp server and has a bridge running...i can see it on packet sniffer....the vmware virtual network broadcasts when im nopt even using vmware
[05:56] <Anpheus> How can I alter what is and is not an extended partition?
[05:56] <mister_roboto> gansinho: it's not ctl-alt-del   it's ctl-alt-backspace
[05:56] <gansinho> bulmer: nice joke
[05:56] <b33nr00ted> do u cant wats on the partition...like can u format it?
[05:56] <conic> on windows i can just go into services and turn em off
[05:56] <gansinho> bulmer: if you don't know, just say that..
[05:57] <bulmer> gansinho: am reading you wrong?
[05:57] <Anpheus> I know there's a limit of 4 primary partitions on a hard drive, that's fine.
[05:57] <conic> but dunno about ubuntu
[05:57] <civilwest> just unplug the thing....wont hurt ubuntu
[05:57] <b33nr00ted> grub should let u do multiboot
[05:57] <bulmer> gansinho: you said completely noh?
[05:57] <Anpheus> I'm sorry, b33nr00ted but you've entered the discussion too late.
[05:57] <pr3d4t0r> Q. Edgy box with two NICs; external NIC is configured correctly and can talk to the outside world.  The box is set to runlevel 5, sshd is running.  I can connect to it from internal 192.168.* and from external network 74.0.125.26 - 30, (machine is .28) but not from anywhere else outside.  What could be causing this?  No firewall, only service is SSH; ssh times out.  Thanks in advance.
[05:57] <Anpheus> The problem isn't GRUB.
[05:57] <hendrickvp> what is the restart command in ssh, for Ubuntu Server 6.x
[05:57] <Anpheus> The problem is that Edgy changed my partition table in a way that doesn't let Windows XP boot.
[05:58] <kuto> hi
[05:58] <kuto> how do i play dvd movie with ubuntu?
[05:58] <b33nr00ted> sorry sorry
[05:58] <J4k3> Anpheus: set the XP partition back as bootable.
[05:58] <Anpheus> Go into gparted and add the boot flag to it? I think I did that already.
[05:58] <civilwest> download codecs
[05:58] <b33nr00ted> gansinho: do "ps -aux" and find the process u wanna kill
[05:58] <civilwest> to play movies
[05:58] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - are you using a router?
[05:58] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: you have forwarding enabled?
[05:58] <Anpheus> Yeah, you're too late J4k3. I already did that.
[05:58] <kuto> civilwest: what kind of codecs
[05:58] <Anpheus> Let'
[05:59] <civilwest> use Synaptic package manager
[05:59] <kuto> civilwest:
[05:59] <b33nr00ted> apt-get install
[05:59] <civilwest> streamers
[05:59] <kuto> can you tell me what specific codec to  install
[05:59] <Anpheus> Let's simplify this: How can I alter the partition table so that XP is on a primary, as opposed to logical / extended partition?
[05:59] <hendrickvp> what is the restart command in ssh, for Ubuntu Server 6.x
[05:59] <conic> hmm now when i go to services in ubuntu or network it says "you are not allowed to access the system configuration"
[05:59] <arrenlex> Anpheus: It might be possible to use dd to do it.
[05:59] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  <-- something like this
[05:59] <conic> time for another reinstall i think
[05:59] <arrenlex> Anpheus: To copy the partition.
[05:59] <conic> gawd ubuntu is buggy crap
[05:59] <b33nr00ted> i agree
[05:59] <bimberi> hendrickvp: sudo reboot
[05:59] <hendrickvp> tnx
[06:00] <arrenlex> Anpheus: That would entail creating a new, primary partition the same size as your windows partition, and then using dd to make a bit-copy.
[06:00] <Anpheus> Hmm...
[06:00] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Let me think about it furhter.
[06:00] <arrenlex> further *
[06:00] <b33nr00ted> no i disagree with it being buggy:P
[06:00] <J4k3> I <3 buggy users.
[06:00] <un_operateur1> /etc/init.d/sshd restart   maybe
[06:00] <Anpheus> arrenlex, it seems to me that somehow Ubuntu managed to edit the partition table to put XP in an extended partition.
[06:00] <noelferreira> hi people everyone with RT61 Wireless Driver? Everything is ok in my edgy amd64.
[06:00] <noelferreira> However i can't configure my ' /etc/network/interfaces ' file. If i try to do that my system hang up on the next reboot. But if i delete the file everything works great.
[06:00] <noelferreira> The only problem is that i have to manually bring up ra0 every start up. I just open a terminal console and type 'sudo dhclient ra0' and all works ok.
[06:00] <noelferreira> I also tried to my a script to bring up it but i was not well sucedded. i wonder if you know any solution for my problem.
[06:00] <noelferreira> some output that might help:
[06:00] <noelferreira> > dmesg | grep RT61
[06:00] <conic> its prolly just the third party apps making it buggy dunno
[06:00] <noelferreira> [ 40.854561]  RT61: Vendor = 0x1814, Product = 0x0302
[06:00] <noelferreira> [ 151.751515]  RT61: RfIcType= 3
[06:00] <noelferreira> > dmesg | grep ra0

[06:00] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, it's working now..thanks :)  not sure what I was doing wrong before, but all appears to be well now
[06:00] <un_operateur1> noelferreira, stop
[06:00] <arrenlex> Anpheus: I have no idea what ubuntu did. I've never seen anything like this.
[06:00] <noelferreira> i mean anyone
[06:00] <arrenlex> !pastebin | noelferreira
[06:00] <Ubotwo> noelferreira: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:00] <noelferreira> sorry
[06:00] <noelferreira> just a question
[06:00] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: I love it when problems fix themselves! :)
[06:01] <civilwest> gstreamers....just start dn loading them...youll get the right one....youll need a player too!
[06:01] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: No forwarding enabled.
[06:01] <un_operateur1> noelferreira, use a pastebin
[06:01] <b33nr00ted> haha that was a bot:P
[06:01] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: I'm not trying to reach the outside through this machine yet.
[06:01] <arrenlex> Anpheus: Join #ubuntu-offtopic please, because there is someone there who knows what they're talking about. :)
[06:01] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, a friend of mine called it the FM principle (freakin magic) :)
[06:01] <dfgas> arrenlex: yah not working so far  :(
[06:01] <noelferreira> to put my question?
[06:01] <Ch1ppy> hey, my adept has picked up a bunch of packages as unnecessary (kde stuff etc) that are actually needed, and keeps bugging me to run autoremove to get rid of them... how do I get rid of all those packages on the autoremove list?
[06:01] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: There is a router in front of the box.
[06:01] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: you were trying to reach from external to where again?
[06:01] <arrenlex> dfgas: Aw. Ask Geoffrey2 to lend you some magic.
[06:01] <kuto> civilwest: thanks
[06:02] <kuto> civilwest: do you know if totem can play wmv?
[06:02] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: From anywhere in the outside world to 74.0.125.28
[06:02] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - are there any other machines on your network?
[06:02] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Yes, a gateway that this machine will eventually replace.
[06:02] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: 74.0.125.26
[06:02] <b33nr00ted> pr3d4t0r: are u trying to make the box into a router?
[06:02] <civilwest> yes....thats what i use....works great!
[06:02] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: Not yet.
[06:03] <b33nr00ted> well..wat else are u using it for
[06:03] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: Right now I just want it to act as an SSH server.
[06:03] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - its just a sshd ?
[06:03] <Gumby> can anyone tell me which debian tree ubuntu packages are based on (if any)
[06:03] <dellthinker> ok
[06:03] <b33nr00ted> sshd for what?
[06:03] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Yes.
[06:03] <b33nr00ted> just to go too?
[06:03] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: Yes, for now.
[06:03] <b33nr00ted> ok..
[06:03] <b33nr00ted> use smoothwall
[06:03] <b33nr00ted> its a good distro for that
[06:03] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - your certain your host.allow list is empty?
[06:03] <b33nr00ted> cuz its also good for a router and a gateway computer
[06:03] <dellthinker> host.deny too
[06:03] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Let me look.
[06:03] <hendrickvp> hey guys, I have a problem connecting to mysql.... I can not login, I believe it is one of two problems either mysql not starting or not listing on non-local ips
[06:04] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Both are empty.
[06:04] <b33nr00ted> pr3d4t0r: trust me smoothwall or ipcops...good distro's for gateways..and VERY easy to setup
[06:04] <cafuego> hendrickvp: The latter is default.
[06:04] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: OKi.
[06:04] <dfgas> Geoffrey2: you there?
[06:04] <Shadowpillar> well damn
[06:04] <b33nr00ted> secure too
[06:04] <Shadowpillar> I have an unsupported webcam
[06:04] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: Do both work well headless?
[06:04] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - can any other machines see this box on the network?
[06:04] <tonyyarusso> I'm getting the following error when trying to FTP into my server, which requires secure connections.  After running the ssh/sftp commands, it returns "Error: Could not read from socket: Connection reset by peer", and disconnects.
[06:05] <b33nr00ted> yes
[06:05] <cafuego> hendrickvp: So you'll need to tell mysqld to listen on the other IP(s) too.
[06:05] <dfgas> arrenlex: it says amixer: Mixer attach default error: no such device
[06:05] <b33nr00ted> im running smoothwall now as my gateway
[06:05] <arrenlex> dfgas: Is your sound chip supported?
[06:05] <cafuego> hendrickvp: You can probably add a 'bind-address' entry in /etc/mysql/my.cnf
[06:05] <sartan> if anyone was keeping track =P user error, i forgot to make clean after i resolved my missing dependancies.
[06:05] <hendrickvp> correct, which I have set to %
[06:05] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: 74.0.125.26 and everything in the internal 192.168.0.* network can see it and log on through SSH just fine over either NIC.
[06:06] <cafuego> hendrickvp: '%' is not a valid IP address.
[06:06] <hendrickvp> does not work, neither does my remote computers IP
[06:06] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: All the iptables rules are cleared.  Blank slate.
[06:06] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - So what were you trying to do?
[06:06] <cafuego> hendrickvp: You need to list IPs there, the syntax is NOT like that used in the mysql tables.
[06:06] <b33nr00ted> are u trying to setup a DHCPD?
[06:06] <un_operateur1> tonyyarusso, SSH/SFTP and FTP are two completely different things
[06:06] <hendrickvp> cafuego: so 192.168.0.0?
[06:07] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: Is that for me?  No.
[06:07] <cafuego> hendrickvp: no, that's a network address.
[06:07] <un_operateur1> if you try SSH stuff on FTP it's bound to failt
[06:07] <cafuego> hendrickvp: 192.168.0.1 probably.
[06:07] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: I'm trying to get SSH to work so that if I log on from anywhere else it's visible.
[06:07] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, did you not change it to 0.0.0.0 yesterday??
[06:07] <tonyyarusso> un_operateur1: I'm just doing it with gFTP, with the SSH2 option.  Is that not correct?  (Sorry, last time I actually used FTP to a secure server was on Windows)
[06:07] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Eventually the machine will behave like 74.0.125.26; nmap it to see which ports are open.
[06:07] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - So from another IP outside your network
[06:07] <b33nr00ted> pr3d4t0r: wat happeneds when u nmap localhost
[06:07] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Yes.
[06:07] <hendrickvp> when I change it do I need to reset or just copy?
[06:08] <xtr> satan. Dant.
[06:08] <dfgas> arrenlex: yah it worked on the last motherboard
[06:08] <b33nr00ted> apt-get install nmap pr3d4t0r
[06:08] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - you'll have to allow it in your router
[06:08] <arrenlex> dfgas: The same sound card?
[06:08] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: It gives me the right list of open ports:  port 22.
[06:08] <dfgas> the drivers are loaded but it doesn't work
[06:08] <dfgas> yup
[06:08] <dfgas> exact
[06:08] <b33nr00ted> ok so its open?
[06:08] <arrenlex> dfgas: Hm.
[06:08] <un_operateur1> tonyyarusso, SFTP is not FTP -- SFTP is SSH with an emulation of a few file transfer commands
[06:08] <b33nr00ted> and ur router is open aswell?
[06:08] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: The router is configured correctly, it seems.
[06:08] <b33nr00ted> wat router u got?
[06:08] <un_operateur1> for SFTP to work -- you need SSH working
[06:08] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - mind if i try something ?
[06:08] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: I moved the .26 to other IP addresses and the router is letting the traffic through.
[06:09] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Please.
[06:09] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, have you got IPTables up on the SSH server?
[06:09] <dfgas> edgy sucks
[06:09] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - whats the ip of the box you want to let ppl ssh into?
[06:09] <dfgas> if it was dapper it would have worked fine
[06:09] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Not at the moment.
[06:09] <hendrickvp> cafuego: after I change it to 0.0.0.0 that will set msql to listen to any ip correct? Then after I replace the current file in /etc/mysql/ do I need to restart the server?
[06:09] <kuto> hmm my dvd still wont be able to read
[06:09] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: 74.0.125.28 - box with trouble.
[06:09] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: look at your /etc/ssh/sshd_config and see if there is any AllowedUsers  setting..those are the only one allowed to log-in
[06:09] <tonyyarusso> un_operateur1: Okay, I'll rephrase: If I have ssl_enable=YES in /etc/vsftpd.conf, how, with gFTP, do I connect to that?
[06:09] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Let me check.
[06:10] <tonyyarusso> un_operateur1: btw, ssh to the box normally works fine.
[06:10] <un_operateur1> tonyyarusso, SSL makes up for FTPS not SFTP :)
[06:10] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - icmp's dropping. I can already see its a router issue
[06:10] <un_operateur1> SFTP and FTPS are again two different things
[06:10] <tonyyarusso> un_operateur1: Aaaah.  Then it's just my misinterpretation of gFTP labelling.  :)
[06:10] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - what kind of router is it?
[06:10] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: after I change it to 0.0.0.0 that will set msql to listen to any ip correct? Then after I replace the current file in /etc/mysql/ do I need to restart the server?
[06:11] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: I believe we're blocking icmp on the router and I know for sure I'm dropping it on the other server.
[06:11] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, you need to restart mysql-server at that time, yes
[06:11] <Ch1ppy> hey, if my adept has picked up a bunch of important packages as no longer required and wants to autoremove them, how can I clear that list?
[06:11] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: It's a Xyzel DSL crapter :)
[06:11] <tonyyarusso> un_operateur1: Is it safe to assume FTPS uses a different port?
[06:11] <b33nr00ted> thats a modem isnt it?
[06:11] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - do you have that machine in the dmz area?
[06:11] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: thanks man your a big help!
[06:11] <un_operateur1> tonyyarusso, no, it uses 21 just like FTP does
[06:11] <tonyyarusso> un_operateur1: hmm
[06:11] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, does it work??
[06:11] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Yes, both machines are supposed to be DMZ'd.
[06:12] <dellthinker> hrm......
[06:12] <dellthinker> sec
[06:12] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Compare that one to .26.
[06:12] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: ftps is like smtp auth, you connect first, then start a TLS negotiation and encrypt the link.
[06:12] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: In fact, I'm connected here through .28, so I know it can reach the outside world.
[06:12] <b33nr00ted> pr3d4t0r: use portforwarding instead...or try
[06:12] <Madpilot> tonyyarusso, wouldn't sftp use ssh's port?
[06:12] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: Eventually - not yet.
[06:12] <cafuego> Madpilot: Yes it does (but it may or may no use udp too)
[06:12] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: Okay.  Now to figure out how to do it..
[06:13] <b33nr00ted> why dont u just do that to see if it is ur router...
[06:13] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - you say "supposed" are you sure that their in dmz?
[06:13] <tonyyarusso> Madpilot: ports 20,21,22 all go to that machine okay
[06:13] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, 74.0.125.28 is pingable from here -- just not sshable to
[06:13] <pr3d4t0r> b33nr00ted: I did that already when I had the Covad guys on the phone.
[06:13] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: It's in the DMZ.
[06:13] <Madpilot> tonyyarusso, isn't ssh port 23?
[06:13] <jbroome> 22
[06:13] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Where is "here"?
[06:13] <jbroome> telnet is 23
[06:14] <dellthinker> 21 :D
[06:14] <un_operateur1> here is the UK
[06:14] <tonyyarusso> Madpilot: 22 I think.  Like I said before, I can ssh in on cli okay, if that tells us anything.
[06:14] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - yeah im getting ping replies, but its not accepting
[06:14] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I see.
[06:14] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: just to make sure the command is right before I send it.... sudo reboot mysql?
[06:14] <jbroome> 21 is ftp
[06:14] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: OKi - I'm trying to figure out why SSH wouldn't connect.
[06:15] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: and sftp is enabled in sshd_config?
[06:15] <dellthinker> Is the daemon running?
[06:15] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Yes.
[06:15] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, eerrr -- no -- i think it is    /etc/init.d/mysql restart
[06:15] <dellthinker> hm..
[06:15] <hendrickvp> k, tnx
[06:15] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: I'm connected to this channel through that machine, logged on to it from within my network via SSH.
[06:15] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: Actually, sftp might not be what I'm going for.  I'm not sure at this point.  ssl_enable=YES is what's in the config.  I may need to look up more about the difference between sftp and ftps...
[06:16] <kuto> whats a good ssh program for windows
[06:16] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, have you any other services on the machine we could test -- perhaps a webserver or something -- some ISPs block port 22, so we can verify if yours has
[06:16] <pr3d4t0r> kuto: PuTTY.
[06:16] <Jeffm515> hey all -- I'm just wondering: I've got a windows machine, and my linux box side by side.. almost identical builds, but for some reason my laptop screams when it comes to things like web browsing, while firefox on my tower is slower then dialup.. I'm wondering if my toying around with installs of media players, and the such, if I've royally screwed something up..
[06:16] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: sftp is simply ssh with a different shell on top
[06:16] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I was thinking of that.  Let me install Apache2.
[06:16] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: ftps is completely different from sftp.
[06:16] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - try and add the machine in port range forward
[06:16] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: hmm.... that "file is not there" at lest according to ubuntu it is not
[06:16] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: There is no forwarding.
[06:16] <b33nr00ted> thanks u dellthinker
[06:16] <b33nr00ted> :)
[06:17] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, just use tab dude :)
[06:17] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - how many ip's do you have?
[06:17] <un_operateur1> /etc/init.d/my<TAB>  :)
[06:17] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: What I'd like is for the data to be secure going back and forth, which does that, and what's the purpose of the other?
[06:17] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: The router is routing for all machines in 74.0.125.26 - 30 ( it's at .25).
=== Kimahri is now known as Tidus
[06:17] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Five.
[06:17] <dellthinker> mk
[06:17] <hendrickvp> oh sorry, I'm learning, I'm learning
[06:17] <v4m21> guys I can't able to find perl ppm command in edgy relase how to install it ?
[06:17] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, what kind of a router is it?
[06:17] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: your sshd_config  has ListenAddress  activated? maybe it is set for your internal only?
[06:17] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Xyzel.
[06:17] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - covad is cable?
[06:17] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Let me check.
[06:18] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: SDSL.
[06:18] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, and i presume you are not using NAT in this instance??
[06:18] <b33nr00ted> i think thats a modem..
[06:18] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - what happens if you try it with just the modem?
[06:18] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Not yet.
[06:18] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: What do you mean?
[06:18] <b33nr00ted> unplug the router..
[06:18] <dellthinker> Exactly
[06:18] <Anpheus> Ok guys.
[06:18] <dellthinker> Plug it directly to the modem
[06:18] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker, b33nr00ted:  Ah.  There is no modem.
[06:19] <b33nr00ted> straight connection from modem to computer
[06:19] <b33nr00ted> :S...
[06:19] <dellthinker> aha
[06:19] <b33nr00ted> haha
[06:19] <dellthinker> Lovely
[06:19] <dellthinker> lol
[06:19] <b33nr00ted> this is funny...
[06:19] <Anpheus> How do I change my partition table so that XP is no longer in an extended partition?
[06:19] <SilentDis> 'lo :)
[06:19] <Jeffm515> it's a dsl gateway, it's acting as the router..
[06:19] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: It's a dedicated DSL router.
[06:19] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - ah, now i see
[06:19] <b33nr00ted> thats not a router man..
[06:19] <rcrook> Anpheus: reinstall
[06:20] <Jeffm515> hey all -- I'm just wondering: I've got a windows machine, and my linux box side by side.. almost identical builds, but for some reason my laptop screams when it comes to things like web browsing, while firefox on my tower is slower then dialup.. I'm wondering if my toying around with installs of media players, and the such, if I've royally screwed something up..
[06:20] <v4m21> guys where is perl package manager in ubuntu ?
[06:20] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: I think I'm doing something wrong...... I'm typing /etc/ini.d/my<TAB> restart
[06:20] <bulmer> Anpheus: umm doing any repartitioning, kind messes up your data ..
[06:20] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  you don't, really.  it's [primary partition] [extended (logical)(logical)] .  you can't really pull it 'out' without repartitioning usually... at least not without some odd partitioning program
[06:20] <un_operateur1> v4m21, there is no PPM on *nix -- use cpan instead
[06:20] <v4m21> k, thanks.
[06:20] <Anpheus> Yeah, well, somehow ubuntu managed to put XP into an extended partition.
[06:20] <b33nr00ted> hendrickvp: lol...no...
[06:20] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - is all 5 ips being used?
[06:20] <Anpheus> So I want to undo that.
[06:21] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, lol -- <TAB> represents an actual hit of the tab key :p
[06:21] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, not meant to be typed in literally
[06:21] <hendrickvp> guys I think I need to take linux 101
[06:21] <hendrickvp> lol
[06:21] <Jeffm515> it'll proform an auto complete
[06:21] <Jeffm515> <tab>
[06:21] <bulmer> Anpheus: you can not do a re-install? it may be quicker than recovering it like so..
[06:21] <b33nr00ted> hendrickvp: u need to press the tab button..it will auto complete
[06:21] <Anpheus> Ok, but let me posit something for you bulmer.
[06:21] <Anpheus> Let's say I do a reinstall on C: using the Windows Disc.
[06:22] <dellthinker> smoke break
[06:22] <dellthinker> :D
[06:22] <Anpheus> Won't C: still be in an extended partition?
[06:22] <b33nr00ted> no
[06:22] <CountDown> Has there been any resolution for getting Amarok 1.4 to play MP3s in Edgy?  I've already installed gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly and libxine-extracodecs, which worked under Dapper but doesn't work under Edgy.
[06:22] <Anpheus> No? But Windows won't change the partition table. It'll mess around with the MBR
[06:22] <un_operateur1> C: is almost always a primary partition
[06:22] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: No, only two.
[06:22] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: .26 and .28
[06:22] <bulmer> no  C: is your first hd partition it sees..
[06:22] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  I'd i'm in agreement with bulmer.  sure there's partition manager out there that *claim* to do stuff like that.. but they tend to end up causing more headaches than they are worth :P
[06:22] <Anpheus> Yeah, but it's in an extended partition.
[06:22] <b33nr00ted> c: is primary
[06:22] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=108 - this is what I get from 140.174.10.252
[06:23] <Anpheus> Listen carefully, as this is apparently difficult to comprehend: C: _WAS_, _WAS_, _WAS_ a primary partition.
[06:23] <Anpheus> Ubuntu Edgy screwed that up.
[06:23] <Anpheus> It's no longer a primary partition.
[06:23] <Anpheus> That broke windows.
[06:23] <Anpheus> Ok?
[06:23] <b33nr00ted> haha
[06:23] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  just curious:  why is this 'hurting' you, btw?
[06:23] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: .26 doesn't respond to ICMP -- that's by design.  It's firewalled.
[06:23] <b33nr00ted> hes FREAKKKINNG out
[06:23] <Jeffm515> withdrawls..
[06:23] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: .25 is the DSL router, .28 is the SSH machine.
[06:24] <SilentDis> anpheus:  ok, windows won't boot anymore?
[06:24] <Anpheus> Maybe because my windows partition is broken?
[06:24] <Anpheus> Correct!
[06:24] <Jeffm515> <<lights a candle and will pray for your deleviery Anpheus
[06:24] <Anpheus> It won't boot, the Recovery Console will not fix it.
[06:24] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: So .28 responds to ICMP pings, but not to SSH.
[06:24] <Anpheus> Jeffm515, shut up.
[06:24] <b33nr00ted> what is on it that u need so bad? Reformat? dont u backup your shit?
[06:24] <hendrickvp> k, so /etc/ini.d/mysql (tab) restart / etc/ini.d/mysq restart (tab) dosent work, I'm going through a SSH client in OS X
[06:24] <Jeffm515> dude, your MBR is broken. login using the supprot console, and type in "fixmbr"
[06:24] <Anpheus> Because reformatting it means destroying the registry.
[06:24] <Jeffm515> .. oh, and you're welcome.
[06:24] <Jeffm515> :)
[06:24] <Anpheus> (11:24:15 PM) Anpheus: It won't boot, the Recovery Console will not fix it.
[06:25] <b33nr00ted> wats in ur registry that u need?
[06:25] <Anpheus> Oh, you're illiterate.
[06:25] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  what happens when it tries to boot?  (i've installed windows to logicals inside extendeds before, without angst
[06:25] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, just copy and paste this into your command line SSH session -- /etc/init.d/mysql restart
[06:25] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer:   #ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 - that's the only thing that may look weird in sshd_config.
[06:25] <bulmer> Anpheus: can you paste your /etc/fstab in #flood  just for us to get an idea..
[06:25] <Jeffm515> it'll ask you if you're sure you wanna rebuild your MBR, hit yes.
[06:25] <malt> hello, does my mime.types file look right, where it should open bmp files on the site www.m4lt.com/mime.types
[06:25] <Anpheus> Well, GRUB absolutely refuses to acknowledge that there's anything to boot off of. I don't even know which (hd0,#) it is.
[06:25] <b33nr00ted> hehe
[06:25] <vinboy> how to check if my SATAII controller supports NCQ?
[06:25] <Anpheus> So I tried everything from 1 to 6.
[06:25] <b33nr00ted> "sudo rm -rf / "
[06:25] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Sorry it took me that long to reply; I was following up on dellthinker and b33nr00ted's comments.
[06:25] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: okay then it is commented so its not Listening to a particular ip address
[06:25] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, it must be 0.0.0.0 -- to mean that any client can connect to the daemon
[06:26] <hendrickvp> what the heck! when I type it, it doesn't work! When I copy it does.....
[06:26] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  there is no need for such words.  I'm trying to help you.  I think it might be best if you simply scour the web, though, might offer more assistance.  good luck!
[06:26] <Anpheus> To be brief, GRUB doesn't acknowledge that Windows is there to boot.
[06:26] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, because you made a typo
[06:26] <Anpheus> I've scoured the web, I usually find the best help in this channel.
[06:26] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Right, but it's commented out.  So it should just listen everywhere - correct?
[06:26] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yeah.
[06:26] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: yes correct
[06:26] <Madpilot> b33nr00ted, goodbye. Joking about sudo rm -rf just earned you a 48hr ban
[06:26] <hendrickvp> propbly
[06:27] <Anpheus> wow that's depressing
[06:27] <Jeffm515> omg.
[06:27] <Jeffm515> lol
[06:27] <Anpheus> I just saw an anti-net neutrality ad paid for by a cable and telecommunications consortium.
[06:27] <Anpheus> That's almost as depressing as Ubuntu screwing with my partition table.
[06:27] <SilentDis> thank you Madpilot.
[06:28] <cafuego> You're pro net neutrality? You must be a communist or terrorist or something. </sarcasm>
[06:28] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  lets try again, now that the... ahem... jokers are out lol.  what happens when windows tries to boot?  does it appear in the grub list at all?  I'm simply trying to understand the problem, and formulate a fix or workaround.
[06:28] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: how about that AllowedUsers  you have that set too on that sshd_config?
[06:28] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker, bulmer:  I have Apache running on port 80 now.
[06:29] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Let me check.
[06:29] <_goofy_> does anyone know any software to manage a LVM with a GUI
[06:29] <Anpheus> Well, the weird thing was that Ubuntu Edgy didn't add a Windows XP entry to menu.lst. I didn't pay attention to it at first and said to myself that I would fix it later, you know. I knew how to add entries to menu.lst so it wasn't a big deal.
[06:29] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: It should be fine, since I'm logged on oto the box right now.
[06:29] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: I can not connect, bind = 0.0.0.0 , and I have restarted the  mysql server
[06:29] <Anpheus> So I added an entry to grub and, it didn't work.
[06:29] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker, bulmer:  http://74.0.125.28/apache2-default/
[06:30] <Anpheus> So I added more entries, you know, trying different (hd0,#) combinations.
[06:30] <Anpheus> None of them worked.
[06:30] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, its a no go from here
[06:30] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: The variable is not on the file.
[06:30] <Anpheus> Finally I tried to use the Windows Recovery Console, and it correctly found C:\Windows\ and allowed me to log in, and perform fixboot and fixmbr.
[06:30] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: are you seeing our attempt to ssh in on your log file?
[06:30] <Anpheus> All that did was get rid of GRUB, and now my BIOS would just say "No boot device. Press F1 to retry..."
[06:30] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: No.
[06:31] <Anpheus> So I used a Live CD to restore GRUB.
[06:31] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, it must be   ---   bind-address            = 0.0.0.0
[06:31] <CaterpillarSquas> hi
[06:31] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, not bind = 0.0.0.0
[06:31] <Anpheus> Then I discovered that Windows XP was moved into an extended partition when I installed Edgy.
[06:31] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: thats a form of access control list..so if its not there..then anybody can ssh in..well except root
[06:31] <Jeffm515> Anpheus: can you at least SEE your xp data?
[06:31] <Anpheus> And that's where I'm at.
[06:31] <Anpheus> Yes.
[06:31] <Anpheus> I've mounted it succesfully.
[06:31] <Jeffm515> okay, good..
[06:31] <Jeffm515> great..
[06:31] <Jeffm515> what happened with the FixMbr?
[06:31] <SilentDis> anpheus:  ok, so you need to add that partition back to the grub list then, correct?
[06:31] <hendrickvp> right it is sorry just writing "short hand"
[06:31] <Anpheus> It warned me saying that it may be a corrupt or invalid MBR, asked me if I was sure, and I typed Y and hit enter.
[06:31] <hendrickvp> bind-address = 0.0.0.0
[06:32] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: so there must be something thats blocking our attempt to get beyond your modem/router as you dont see our ssh attempts
[06:32] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Right now I want the box wide open on SSH.
[06:32] <rcrook> Anpheus: what partition does fdisk say its at?
[06:32] <Anpheus> No, I've already retried the 'fixed' Windows XP.
[06:32] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Once I can connect to it I'll lock SSH down further.
[06:32] <CaterpillarKille> 
[06:32] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: without that AllowedUsers setting then it is wide open
[06:32] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: The only restriction right now on SSH is no root login.
[06:32] <Anpheus> It is in /dev/sda6
[06:32] <SilentDis> anpheus:  i haven't dealt with logical drives in grub personally.  let me hit the man page right quick, and do a bit of searching.
[06:32] <Anpheus> Ok, thank you.
[06:33] <cafuego> Anpheus: that should be hd0,5 if you don't have any PATA harddisks
[06:33] <rcrook> have you tried to set it active and then fixmbr?
[06:33] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: I'm getting nothing in the logs for auth (SSH) or Apache.
[06:33] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: So it's not even connecting.
[06:33] <cafuego> preaction-m: apache has its own logfiles. /var/log/apache
=== abarbaccia__ is now known as abarbaccia
[06:33] <cafuego> grr
[06:33] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Changing the IP address of the server doesn't work either.
[06:33] <pr3d4t0r> :(
[06:33] <Anpheus> No PATA. hd0,5 gives error 22.
[06:33] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - can you use another router?
[06:33] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: right..so it is something between your router and your box thats prventing us to go beyond it
[06:33] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Not at the moment.
[06:34] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, theres something in the way preventing outside access -- I have a feeling it is your router -- with NAT enabled
[06:34] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: I don't think it's the router.
[06:34] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: If it were, then .26 wouldn't work.
[06:34] <cafuego> Anpheus: Are the partition in disk order?
[06:34] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - there is. Its only allowing local connections
[06:34] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: NAT is disabled.  I just checked :)
[06:34] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, .26 is not pingable from here -- only .25 and .28 are
[06:34] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I know.
[06:34] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I don't allow ICMP pings to .26.
[06:35] <Anpheus> cafuego: what do you mean?
[06:35] <MossimO_Boi> hello everybody, I'm new with this uBuntu and Linux thing.
[06:35] <_goofy_> anyone know a hot key or combo for the treminal
[06:35] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: But if you go to, say, http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin -- that's .26
[06:35] <biotrox> hey all, have a Q. in ubuntu if I install the w32codecs_20060611-0.0_i386.deb which multimedia files can be played..?
[06:35] <rob__> I have a quick question.  I have a 64bit proc but I am running the 386 version of Ubuntu to avoid software conflicts.  But my question is would it be better for me to run the 386 kernel modules or the generic ones?
[06:35] <Anpheus> ah, crap, I gave you guys the wrong number.
[06:35] <Anpheus> It's /dev/sda5
[06:35] <cafuego> Anpheus: Are the partitions pghysically in the same order as their numbering?
[06:35] <Anpheus> Which gives error 12, not 22.
[06:35] <Anpheus> Uhm, no.
[06:35] <Anpheus> Uh, see, Ubuntu screwed with the partition table somehow.
[06:35] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: I had bind-address set to 0.0.0.0
[06:35] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: It's something about this box.
[06:36] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  i'm reading up on it now... but from what I can tell, it would be something like hd0,1,5 or something like that... reading more...
[06:36] <cafuego> rob__: much of a muchness
[06:36] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: The .26 Linux box is reachable, ports are open, etc.
[06:36] <MossimO_Boi> does anyone know if Netgear WG311v2 have atheros chipset?  If so, can you guys provide me with the URL to download the driver?
[06:36] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - what was the name of your router sitting in front of the net again?
[06:36] <Anpheus> I have /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6 (both NTFS partitions, the first is Windows core, second is my programs and data on another partition) in an extended partition.
[06:36] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: No, they don't.
[06:36] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: 74.0.125.25
[06:36] <Anpheus> The extended partition is /dev/sda1
[06:36] <MossimO_Boi> aww crap
[06:36] <rob__> cafuego, what do you mean?
[06:36] <Anpheus> The linux partition is /dev/sda2
[06:36] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: Only netgear card with a T after their model number use the atheros chipset.
[06:36] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - no i mean what brand
[06:36] <Anpheus> And the swap is /dev/sda7
[06:36] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, ok, lets sort the router out -- eliminate it -- its a normal DSL router right, was it supplied to you by your ISP or did you get it yourself?
[06:36] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Xyzel
[06:36] <MossimO_Boi> dang..
[06:36] <MossimO_Boi> thankx
[06:36] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: ISP provided.
[06:37] <pdiddy_79> hello guys and girls. quick question...does ubuntu come with any remote desktop software?
[06:37] <Anpheus> The disk order is actually /dev/sda1 which contains /dev/sda5,/dev/sda6,/dev/sda7, then /dev/sda2.
[06:37] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: What does 'lspci | grep Network' say about it?
[06:37] <rcrook> _goofy_:  install yakuake and F12 will get you one
[06:37] <Jeffm515> I've offically decided, buying BLACK CD-R's was POINTLESS.. I can't write on themm.. just sharing that..
[06:37] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: We eliminated the router by moving .26 to other IP addresses and connecting to it remotely.
[06:37] <rcrook> _goofy_: yakuake is pretty cool
[06:37] <Anpheus> Jeffm515: try a silver sharpie.
[06:37] <Jeffm515> oOoOOo.. now if I owned one.
[06:37] <MossimO_Boi> I download the atheros driver 5211 I believe...but it said it's not supported
[06:37] <Jeffm515> :)
[06:37] <MossimO_Boi> I have another one.
[06:37] <rob__> cafuego, can you explain further?
[06:37] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: And by moving .28 to other IP addresses and not being able to connect, regardless of IP.
[06:38] <Anpheus> Jeff, I work projectionist at a theater, we have one in case we need to mark film.
[06:38] <camdenb_> hallo everybody
[06:38] <MossimO_Boi> d-link airplus G DWL-g510
[06:38] <Jeffm515> see.. that's just crazy talk,.. marking film...
[06:38] <MossimO_Boi> do you think it has atheros chipset?
[06:38] <cafuego> rob__: it doesn't matter much which kernel you run. I use the generic one myself
[06:38] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, whats the IP address range and  subnet mask your ISP gave you?
[06:38] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: No.
[06:38] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: I'm fairly sure that's an ACX111
[06:38] <SilentDis> anpheus:  check this out - http://www.oculon.org/hijinx/linux/grub.htm - scroll down to "What if I have Two Hard Drives with Windows on the Second?"
[06:38] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: 74.0.125.25 router, .26 - .30 range, 255.255.255.248
[06:38] <rob__> cafuego, so I will see now difference in performance between the generic and 386 on a 64bit proc?
[06:38] <biotrox> !grdc
[06:38] <Anpheus> Jeffm515: I don't do it. The sharpie can leak into the emulsion on the film and damage it. :P
[06:39] <rob__> no difference*
[06:39] <whyameye> pdiddy_79: you can use vncviewer or in gnome system -> admin -> remote desktop
[06:39] <camdenb_> is there anybody around willing to give me a hand with some compiz setup/troubleshooting?
[06:39] <cafuego> rob__: Nope, they'r both still 32bit kernels.
[06:39] <MossimO_Boi> IC
[06:39] <rob__> cafuego, k thanks
[06:39] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: but you can always ssh in from the internal 192.168.X.X right?
[06:39] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Yes.
[06:39] <pdiddy_79> thanks whyameye, i will give it a try now :)
[06:39] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - are you sure its Xyzel or Zyzel ?
[06:39] <MossimO_Boi> I'm trying to run the auditor with these card...I guess it can't be help
[06:39] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: And from .26 to .28.
[06:39] <MossimO_Boi> thanks Cafuego...
[06:39] <Anpheus> SilentDis: hm, but how does that work with XP being on an extended partition?
[06:40] <SilentDis> !anybody | camdenb_
[06:40] <sidny4> I have an AMD 64, do I need to use the 64 bit version of ubuntu?
[06:40] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: the 'acx' driver may work, provided you give it the correct firmware version.
[06:40] <MossimO_Boi> Cafuego:  I'm trying to find the drivers forever, but can't, so I went on here
[06:40] <MossimO_Boi> I did try
[06:40] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: ZyXEL, sorry.
[06:40] <biotrox> pr3d4t0r | if i installed w32codecs_20060611-0.0_i386.deb can i play all multimedia files ???
[06:40] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: not windows drivers, Linux drivers.
[06:40] <whyameye> sidny4: no and in fact I have the a 64 bit AMD which I run with the 686 kernel
[06:40] <pr3d4t0r> biotrox: I don't know.
[06:41] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  I *think* it should... you'll be mapping partitions, rather than drives, but the format should be similar...  trying to find more now
[06:41] <pr3d4t0r> biotrox: I use a Mac for workstation :)
[06:41] <Jeffm515> alright, I'm gonna go do my 3rd (and hopefully FINAL) re-install... thanks for everything guys.. Anpheus: good luck
[06:41] <sidny4> ok, I'm trying to use the k7 kernel but it keeps locking up, any idea why?
[06:41] <biotrox> pr3d4t0r | so u use ubuntu for..?
[06:41] <pr3d4t0r> biotrox: Server.
[06:41] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - is it wireless/ethernet or both?
[06:41] <biotrox> oooo
[06:42] <MossimO_Boi> cafuego: I found some airodump for windows.  that's why I want to run it from windows
[06:42] <pr3d4t0r> biotrox: And I'm just getting started.  First Ubuntu installation.  Normally I run Solaris or RH.
[06:42] <MossimO_Boi> but I need to have atheros
[06:42] <biotrox> oooo
[06:42] <MossimO_Boi> driver
[06:42] <biotrox> oke
[06:42] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: DSL --> Ethernet.
[06:42] <vanberge> soo... anybody willing to help me do 3d acceleration on my laptop?  ati rage mobility is the card
[06:42] <vanberge> thanks in advance...
[06:42] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: 'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)'
[06:42] <camdenb_> can anybody help w/ the "glXBindTexImageEXT is missing" compiz error?
[06:42] <Music_Shuffle> pr3d4t0r, slightly OT, but is Solaris similar to ubuntu?
[06:42] <MossimO_Boi> oh
[06:42] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: However, I'm 99.9% sure that card is not an atheros card, so the atheros driver is useless.
[06:43] <pr3d4t0r> Music_Shuffle: Not much :)
[06:43] <MossimO_Boi> cafuego: correct
[06:43] <pr3d4t0r> Music_Shuffle: It's similar in that it's a *NIX, but Solaris is more BSDish + S
[06:43] <pr3d4t0r> SV.
[06:43] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, did this setup ever work?? i mean could you connect to .27-30 before?
[06:43] <pr3d4t0r> Music_Shuffle: No bells and whistles.  Solaris is like a truck.
[06:43] <Music_Shuffle> Ahh ok.
[06:43] <vanberge> camdenb_, i've never heard of that before... did you try ubuntu-xgl ?
[06:43] <MossimO_Boi> cafuego: I have tried auditor collection on both card...but they can't do anything
[06:43] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes.
[06:43] <Music_Shuffle> Not very user-friendly and whatnot?
[06:43] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I can connect to .27-.30 any time.
[06:43] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  I think i hit paydirt... gimme a moment to review this...
=== miativolksfi is now known as nex_06
[06:44] <camdenb_> ooh, never knew of that place.
[06:44] <MossimO_Boi> cafuego: I ran the kismet, but very poor
[06:44] <nex_06> Hey, can anyone here help me for a minute with packages in Dapper?
[06:44] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - im looking for your firmware version, make it easier for me and tell me the model of your router and firmware ver.
[06:44] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: Let me log on to the router.
[06:44] <MossimO_Boi> cafuego: they can't detect any boxes
[06:44] <cafuego> MossimO_Boi: Yeah, kismet is fairly useless on badly supported cards.
[06:44] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: I'll find it for you.
[06:44] <Anpheus> To think that I got into this mess because I wanted to see if the new ATI driver worked for my card.
[06:44] <MossimO_Boi> yeah
[06:44] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  yeah, i got a fix.  let me pastebin...
[06:44] <Anpheus> It did, and Beryl looked really nice. It was really nice until I rebooted.
[06:44] <klees> is there a way to install the stock ati driver/module to a custom kernel?
[06:45] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: the only other thing I can suspect is if the SELInux feature is enabled but am not familiar with it enuff to troubleshoot what it blocks and allows
[06:45] <MossimO_Boi> cafuego: thanks for clearing everything up...if not I'm gonna spend couple more days trying to find the driver
[06:45] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, whats odd to me is you have 74.0.125.25 as the router -- and all hosts behind it are on the same subnet .. and you are not using NAT -- it doesnt add up --
[06:45] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: what was that command for checking on the ports mysql is listening on
[06:45] <MossimO_Boi> cafuego: haha lame huh?
[06:45] <Anpheus> So by pastebin you mean?
[06:45] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: It's a Prestige 643, in the ROM.
[06:45] <Anpheus> SilentDis: Where can I find the pastebin?
[06:45] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker: No firmware version, but I'm looking for it.
[06:45] <klees> !pastebin

[06:46] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, are you sure NAT is not turned on??
[06:46] <klees> does anyone have an answer to my question?
[06:46] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  my puter is a bit messed up (fscked up PSU) and i'm on dialup.  gimme a minute lol
[06:46] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - lol..
[06:46] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Dude.
[06:46] <dellthinker> pr3d4t0r - Is this router provided by your isp?
[06:46] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I'm positive.

[06:49] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Linux.
[06:49] <dellthinker> un_operateur1 - he should make sure that anyone can connect to that machine first

[06:49] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, that machine is connectable to

[06:55] <Ubotwo> nex_06: opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[06:56] <pr3d4t0r> OKi, I'll return in about 2 minutes.
[06:56] <cafuego> a wrt54g?
[06:56] <dellthinker> Yes
[06:56] <rcrook> nex_06: This is nly a suggestion but it worked for me. Download the .deb file from opera and do sudo dpkg -i <opera.deb filename>
[06:56] <lovloss> is firefox only free as in price?
[06:56] <cafuego> Hmm ok. Which revision?
[06:56] <dellthinker> Revision?
[06:56] <sekhar> rcrok, got?
[06:56] <rcrook> lovloss: no
[06:56] <nex_06> back
[06:56] <sekhar> rcrok,
[06:56] <bulmer> using iwconfig wlan0  shows its up and it has the ESSID but AP is not associated, using iwlist wlan0 scan shows No scan results..how do I activate to let it scan so it can associate?
[06:56] <lovloss> rcrook: They released the code?
[06:56] <whyameye> lovloss: firefox is free as in speech
[06:56] <Anpheus> uh
[06:56] <SilentDis> lovloss:  i believe, when I was in the tech support pits, we just had what would be termed a 'difficult call' :P
[06:56] <rcrook> lovloss: yes
[06:56] <lovloss> *hoorah*
[06:56] <nex_06> OK, thanks
[06:56] <sekhar> rcrook,
[06:57] <cafuego> dellthinker: yes, there is  rev 1, 2 and 3 at least. They have varying amounts of flash and ram.
[06:57] <Anpheus> SilentDis:  looks like my Windows boot is corrupt in more ways than one
[06:57] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  did it work?
[06:57] <lovloss> SilentDis: LOL, somebody got mad at you?
[06:57] <Anpheus> It said... "Starting Up..."
[06:57] <Anpheus> For about 5 minutes.
[06:57] <rcrook> sekhar: I could find anything... sorry.:(
[06:57] <nex_06> I'v been using slack for a while, but I'm liking Ubuntu a lot, just installed it, its all still new to me
[06:57] <lovloss> Anpheus: A windows anything is corrupt already
[06:57] <Anpheus> I'm just going to reinstall it.
[06:57] <rcrook> sekhar: I couldnt find anything... sorry.:(
[06:57] <Anpheus> Aw, a linux zealot.
[06:57] <Anpheus> Here, let me through you a piece of source code.
[06:57] <lovloss> *snags*
[06:57] <Anpheus> throw'
[06:57] <dellthinker> cafuego - 1 i think
[06:57] <Yodabunny> I'm reinstalling windows and realizing why I put Ubuntu on my other PC.
[06:57] <SilentDis> lovloss:  yes, anpheus did... or, at least at the troll.  the troll is gone now at least lol
[06:57] <sekhar> rcrook,is there a need for update from dapper to edgy?
[06:57] <Yodabunny> It's bad
[06:57] <cafuego> dellthinker: you need to be certain
[06:58] <dellthinker> How do i find out?
[06:58] <Music_Shuffle> Yodabunny, I even went back to Windows once.
[06:58] <lovloss> I wish Windows source would leak :D that would piss off some people
[06:58] <cafuego> openwrt.org wiki :-)
[06:58] <Music_Shuffle> After a week, I caved and went back to Linux. =p
[06:58] <sekhar> rcrook, for getting new updated libs?
[06:58] <lovloss> SilentDis: Lol
[06:58] <dellthinker> k
[06:58] <Anpheus> I use Windows because, well, ease of use.
[06:58] <kishan> yodabunny why is it bad
[06:58] <jack|ass> is there a kernel package that has kqemu in it so I don't have to recompile from scratch?
[06:58] <Yodabunny> I have a linux pc and a windows pc
[06:58] <Anpheus> But I have to say, now that the latest ATI driver supports my video card
[06:58] <SilentDis> rule number 1:  never feed, pet, or otherwise touch the trolls!
[06:58] <Anpheus> Linux looks way, way nicer.
[06:58] <Yodabunny> can't play Final Fantasy XI on linux
[06:58] <Anpheus> beryl for example, is so damn spiffy.
[06:58] <cafuego> jack|ass: nope
[06:59] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  on that, we could debate all day.  I have yet to find something 'easier to use' than on linux, then again, I like my console rofl
[06:59] <rcrook> sekhar: probably a good idea... but be warned.. follow the upgrade instructions on the process very carefully... I screwed my upgrade up badly. check the ubuntu forum out on the process
[06:59] <cafuego> jack|ass: Not in the standard Edgy repositories anyway.
[06:59] <Yodabunny> and I can't seem to get flash < 7 working on my linux pc
[06:59] <jack|ass> cafuego: bummer.
[06:59] <lovloss> I agree... but then, i also avoid windows on ethical grounds
[06:59] <kishan> yodabunny if u are a gammer yes windows will be option
[06:59] <lovloss> which is why im stressing out about trying to get more games to run :(
[06:59] <kishan> is it a old pc
[06:59] <SilentDis> in fact... I think ubotu needs troll info... unless it already has it...
[06:59] <SilentDis> !troll
[06:59] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[06:59] <Yodabunny> That's the problem, I only play on game FFXI on windows
[07:00] <lovloss> !Ubotwo
[07:00] <Ubotwo> This is a temporary Ubotu replacement. Please don't abuse it.
[07:00] <Yodabunny> I'm playing battle for wesnoth on linux though
[07:00] <amonkey> i'm trying password protect a folder on apache2 on my edgy box but it seems to be ignoring the .htaccess file.
[07:00] <lovloss> lol
[07:00] <SilentDis> ohhh... time to teach ubotu something lol
[07:00] <kishan> did u try wine yodabunny
[07:00] <Yodabunny> Doesn't work for FFXI
[07:01] <kishan> sorry about that yodabunny
[07:01] <lovloss> SilentDis, you're here so often :) Are you an ubuntu programmer?
[07:01] <Yodabunny> got Orion II working on it but it's VERY slow
[07:01] <pr3d4t0r> dellthinker, bulmer, un_operateur1:  I'm back.
[07:01] <SilentDis> lovloss:  no, just my 'puter is a bit gimpy atm, so I'm forced to amuse myself in simple ways... and i like to help people :)
[07:01] <Yodabunny> mostly a driver problem, I have a crappy vid card in it and I can't get DRI to work
[07:02] <kishan> i guess a day will come when games are linux compatible
[07:02] <lovloss> SilentDis: Ah i see ^_^
[07:02] <pr3d4t0r> I'm now at 74.0.125.27
[07:02] <lovloss> It will happen. "Linux Format" calls the last few years the official linux boom
[07:02] <Yodabunny> I hope so
[07:02] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, two minutes
[07:02] <lovloss> we've accelerated in a lot of ways
[07:02] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: OKi.
[07:02] <init> Oooo, what did I miss?
[07:02] <Yodabunny> I think vista might help with that
[07:02] <SilentDis> lovloss:  I look at it this way:  I just got a kick-ass OS for free, and it has everything I need, and I didn't pay one red cent for it.  least I can do is provide an hour or 2 of my time when I can spare it helping others :)
[07:03] <lovloss> SilentDis: We're all in this together :3
[07:03] <amonkey> Yodabunny, running vista, it's idea of security is askign you 5 times are you sure when you try to install a widget. it's a joke.
[07:03] <Anpheus> lovloss: just don't forget that Slashdot FAQ: Linux is not always the answer.
[07:03] <Anpheus> and amonkey, don't spread FUD.
[07:03] <Anpheus> I've used Vista RC2, and I've seen the release business edition.
[07:04] <Yodabunny> I prefer linux.  I'd use it exclusively if I could run all of the software I use
[07:04] <Yodabunny> I'll never install vista
[07:04] <TGPO> and its a joke
[07:04] <Anpheus> Secure? Vastly more secure than XP. I'd recommend it on those grounds alone.
[07:04] <SilentDis> anpheus:  linux isn't always the answer.  the other answer is BSD :D  lol
[07:04] <Anpheus> Nice Dis.
[07:04] <Yodabunny> I reinstall too often and swap hardware quite often
[07:04] <kishan> i started using computers since 2 yrs now started using windows but now i am linux fan and ubuntu tooo is cool
[07:04] <cafuego> SilentDis: to the question 'what should I virtualise today'  ;-) ?
[07:04] <Anpheus> And? Microsoft caved on the EULA, don't worry about it.
[07:04] <lovloss> Actually, Microsoft is looking to lean iun our direction a bit more. I think that Bill being gone and open source booming like it is makes it difficult for them to ignore us
[07:04] <Anpheus> You can change your hardware in vista.
[07:04] <SilentDis> cafuego:  rofl yes
[07:05] <Anpheus> *gasp*
[07:05] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: your  .27 is now allowing ssh
[07:05] <Anpheus> It's just more FUD that linux zealots spread around.
[07:05] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: I know.
[07:05] <DaRkNeSS|> where can i dl a ndiswrapper for ubuntu 6.06.1
[07:05] <amonkey> Anpheus, it was in the EULA, they took it out cuz we made a ruckus
[07:05] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: That's a MacBook.
[07:05] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: ah okay
[07:05] <rcrook> Windows has it place just as linux does. the OS wars are truely boring now. I run debian on my servers Windows on my lappy and Kubuntu on wy workstation. Each has its place.
[07:05] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: The other machine is still on .28
[07:05] <we6jbo> hi
[07:05] <vanberge> DaRkNeSS|,  just add the universe/multiverse repositories and do apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
[07:05] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: So the router is OK, any other machine I plug here works just fine.
[07:06] <kishan> rcrook is linux not good for laptops
[07:06] <vanberge> anyone want to help me and my laptop with ati drivers ? :-)
[07:06] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: okay..
[07:06] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  you can change it... but when I was running xp, I seem to remember once being prompted to re-register xp because I had swapped too many bits in and out (modems, vid cards, etc)
[07:06] <tonyyarusso> !offtopic | For Windows EULA discussion
[07:06] <Ubotwo> For Windows EULA discussion: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[07:06] <TGPO> I run windows for exactly 1 game, other than that everything I need can be done in linux, and usually better
[07:06] <Anpheus> amonkey, yes, they did.
[07:06] <lovloss> Its not that they dont have their own place, its that one is hordeing source code in the hopes of being a monopoly
[07:06] <we6jbo> I have a question
[07:06] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: The only difference is that this is an Ubuntu machine :(
[07:06] <Anpheus> And SilentDis, is it wrong that they would actually want to keep people from pirating their product?
[07:06] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Otherwise the configuration, etc. is the same as everywhere else.
[07:06] <tonyyarusso> we6jbo: Just ask and see if anyone knows.
[07:06] <Yodabunny> I'd be happy if Linux had vid drivers for my last few pcs
[07:06] <Anpheus> Most of the time it just works, on the odd occasion you call them up and tell them you changed your hardware.
[07:06] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: am about a month into ubutu dapper myself :)
[07:06] <SilentDis> !ati | vanberge
[07:06] <Ubotwo> vanberge: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:06] <Anpheus> Yeah, it's annoying.
[07:06] <we6jbo> Is there a program out there that will tell me if my computer is ubuntu or linux compataible?
[07:07] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: :)
[07:07] <Anpheus> But for 99% of people, it isn't a problem.
[07:07] <vanberge> SilentDis, ive done that about 3 times.  i can't get x to start after that
[07:07] <Anpheus> 99% of people will rather buy a new computer than change the hardware.
[07:07] <rcrook> kishan: its nots that.. i actually use a couple of windows based graphics programs that do things that gimp cant.. so I leave windows on my lappy for then.
[07:07] <DaRkNeSS|> anyone know lol??
[07:07] <we6jbo> or a website
[07:07] <SilentDis> Anpheus:  at tonyyarusso's prompting, i'll be keeping myself topical from here on out :)
[07:07] <tonyyarusso> :)
[07:07] <Yodabunny> I think the biggest problem holding back Linux adoption is having to touch the command line
[07:07] <kishan> ooh ok rcrook cool
[07:07] <Yodabunny> And drivers etc
[07:07] <amonkey> trying to figure out why .htaccess on apache2 on edgy doesn't seem to do anything. any ideas?
[07:07] <DaRkNeSS|> yeah
[07:07] <lovloss> Pirating? Maybe we wouldnt *pirate* if the product didnt cost so much, especially since it sells so well. Not to mention that they put it on computers before you bhuy them. which should be illegal.
[07:07] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: I'm confident that the router, network, etc. are configured correctly in as much as I made the configuration as close as possible to the box at .26, also Linux.
[07:07] <cafuego> Yodabunny: But you don't need to touch the cli at all.
[07:07] <DaRkNeSS|> can someone explain ndiswrappers to me
[07:07] <Anpheus> lovloss, how does it cost so much?
[07:07] <Anpheus> It's a MASSIVE piece of hardware.
[07:07] <vanberge> DaRkNeSS|,  yes i can
[07:07] <whyameye> its the hardware issues for Linux that hold it back. One word: wireless
[07:08] <Anpheus> New games run upwards of $50.
[07:08] <kishan> i like playing around terminal it feels like u doing something lol
[07:08] <tonyyarusso> we6jbo: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport isn't magic, but a good place to start.  There are other hardware components listings around the web.
[07:08] <SilentDis> vanberge:  what errors kick out from X when it tries to start?
[07:08] <Anpheus> You think a new OS should cost the same amount?
[07:08] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: So there is something about this Ubuntu box that is different and preventing it from allowing connections into it.
[07:08] <lovloss> Yes, basically.
[07:08] <Yodabunny> Yes I do
[07:08] <lovloss> After asll, this one's free.
[07:08] <Anpheus> Why?
[07:08] <Anpheus> And it's free because nobody was paid to work on it.
[07:08] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: it seems like it from how you describe the problems
[07:08] <Anpheus> If you want to continue this, let's go to #ubuntu-offtopic.
[07:08] <we6jbo> ok thanks
[07:08] <lovloss> Because an OS is the control center of your computer, and as long as we hide away the technology that creates it then computers cannot evolve
[07:08] <cafuego> Yodabunny: Well, maybe *you* do, but people that need mail/web/word processing don't.
[07:08] <Yodabunny> I've had to hit the command line for about 10-15 things since I installed Ubuntu
[07:08] <h08817> my vlc player only does audio not video why?
[07:08] <vanberge> SilentDis, 'x failed to start... would you like to see logs'
[07:09] <h08817> im trying to play wmv files
[07:09] <lovloss> There's nothing to argue. Im a socialist, so i hate capitalism
[07:09] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Well, you saw that all I had to do was plug a new box here and we were in business.
[07:09] <SilentDis> vanberge:  yeah, dump the last couple lines into a pastebin please :)
[07:09] <Anpheus> Technology is always being hidden behind ever more layers of obscurity. I don't see you bitching about not knowing the exact layout of your CPU?
[07:09] <christian1222> Hi guys, I am installing ubuntu on my laptop, but I want to leave windows on there as well, and i was hoping I could get little help on partitioning the disk. I am at the page called "Partition Disks" in the Ubuntu boot installation
[07:09] <Yodabunny> cafuego you're right, but a lot of people need more than that
[07:09] <SilentDis> !pastebin | vanberge
[07:09] <Ubotwo> vanberge: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:09] <Anpheus> Or are you going to refuse to use Intel or AMD chips because they don't publish CPU schematics?
[07:09] <lovloss> The information is accessible
[07:09] <Music_Shuffle> LOL.
[07:09] <Anpheus> Well? If you're going to be a zealot, let's see it.
[07:09] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: The 2 minutes pause was how long it took me to move the MacBook close to the router, turn the firewall on, and plug it :)
[07:09] <h08817> christian1222, ok whats up
[07:09] <Yodabunny> and most of those don't know anything about the command line
[07:09] <bulmer> pr3d4t0r: right, and it seems like everything is in order..i cant figure it out yet whats preventing that ssh to your specific box
[07:09] <Anpheus> Refuse to use Intel and AMD chips because the chip layouts are IP and illegal to copy.
[07:09] <cafuego> Yodabunny: You'd be amaed how many people don't need more though... and they all buy windows... and office...
[07:09] <Music_Shuffle> Anpheus, Well, REAL men buy silicon and... ;P
[07:10] <Anpheus> Exactly.
[07:10] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Nothing connects to it :(
[07:10] <lovloss> Unfortunately i have no choice, or i actually would prefer they do that. if they make an open chipset, id be there
[07:10] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: SSH, Apache now.
[07:10] <h08817> christian1222, how much free space do u have?
[07:10] <rcrook> lovloss has a point... how long did it take MS to actually get a working stable windows for 64 bit processors? and why do some games consoles use 128 bit prosessors while the majority of PCs still run 32?
[07:10] <Anpheus> lovloss, you do have a choice.
[07:10] <christian1222> h08817: I dont know what to do, and when I did this on my desktop, I totally messed up, and ended up losing everything, and just installing ubuntu all the way
[07:10] <Anpheus> There are open architectures.
[07:10] <Anpheus> You can run linux on those.
[07:10] <christian1222> h08817: about 12 gigs
[07:10] <SilentDis> Anpheus, lovloss:  i am not trying to be rude, but please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic.  thanks! :)
[07:10] <Anpheus> It'll be slow, probably won't run a window manager well, and it won't be very good.
[07:10] <tonyyarusso> rcrook: To offtopic...
[07:10] <cafuego> Music_Shuffle: Yeh. i have a bag of sharp sand here and some super glue.. been meaning to build a new CPU.
[07:10] <h08817> christian1222, ok so whats ur total hd size?
[07:11] <christian1222> h08817: the page starts out "this is an overview of your currently configures partitions..."
[07:11] <Anpheus> ok, well, I'm going.
[07:11] <Music_Shuffle> Share!! :D
[07:11] <lovloss> Id rather not go to another channel, which is why im trying to freeze the conversation as much as possible....
[07:11] <Anpheus> SilentDis: thanks for trying to help.
[07:11] <h08817> christian1222, yeah i know
[07:11] <christian1222> h08817: 65gig
[07:11] <Yodabunny> cafuego not disputing that at all.  Problem is they don't know that's all they need.  The second they can't do something without a tech friend they'll switch
[07:11] <h08817> christian1222, o ok and a newer pc?
[07:11] <christian1222> h08817: err, sorry 60 gig
[07:11] <kishan> christian1222 so u have a linux partition on ur hard disk
[07:11] <SilentDis> anpheus:  sorry we couldn't get ya going :(
[07:11] <christian1222> h08817: its a tablet I bought about 2 yrs ago, runniing XP
[07:11] <nex_06> Ok, another issue.  It seems I can only play .ogg files, not mp3.  I'm guessing there is a package update in the manager?
[07:11] <cafuego> Yodabunny: Yeah, that's no reason to pick windows instead. Most of these popel that I know also can't manage windows without help.
[07:11] <christian1222> kishan: no i dont
[07:11] <h08817> christian1222, o ok its new enough
[07:11] <lovloss> I lay it down for you. I am opposed to capitalism. I morally object to non-open products because i believe technology should be a commonwealth. That is all there is for me to say.
[07:12] <christian1222> kishan: thats what im trying to do i think
[07:12] <SilentDis> !mp3 | nex_06
[07:12] <Ubotwo> nex_06: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[07:12] <Anpheus> SilentDis: you got XP to begin booting.
[07:12] <h08817> christian1222, ok so you only have one partition at the moment correct?
[07:12] <Anpheus> Which means reformatting C: will work.
[07:12] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: Could you please paste your /etc/networks file to http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin ?
[07:12] <Anpheus> So you've done good.
[07:12] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, you there?
[07:12] <pr3d4t0r> bulmer: I'm wondering if this thing is missing a gateway somewhere.
[07:12] <DaRkNeSS|> vanberge are you here?
[07:12] <christian1222> h08817: it says i have 3 partitions: all labeled primary one 49.5 one 10.5 and the lst one 8.2 mb
[07:12] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes.
[07:12] <Anpheus> The problem is, XP now freezes on boot. But I can figure that out on my own.
[07:12] <DaRkNeSS|> i tried replying to yuour pm's but it blocked it because im not regged
[07:12] <kishan> christian1222 use partition software from windows and try to creat a linux partition say of 10 g
[07:12] <drivera90> I want to play Doom. What do I do?
[07:13] <christian1222> h08817: sorry, 49.5 gig, 10.5 gig, and 8.2 mb
[07:13] <vanberge> DaRkNeSS|, yes...
[07:13] <h08817> christian1222, hmm and do u know what is under each partition?
[07:13] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r .. .25 is the routers ip address right -- is that the address on the inside interface or public interface?
[07:13] <SilentDis> anpheus:  eh, that's a start at least... I'd recommend destroying that logical-extended partition stuff though, personally :P
[07:13] <christian1222> h08817: no idea
[07:13] <Yodabunny> cafuego it is a reason, a very good one.  Windows despite all of it's faults babies you through those problems.  There are a lot it can't fix, but the important (from a user perspective) ones it does.
[07:13] <DaRkNeSS|> vanberge join #blahblahwhatever
[07:13] <rcrook> drivera90: get prboom or the edge
[07:13] <h08817> christian1222, i would think the 49.5 is windows
[07:13] <christian1222> h08817: ive never partitioned manually, so this is how the computer is factory configured
[07:13] <h08817> christian1222, well in windows under my computer how many drives does it show?
[07:13] <vanberge> DaRkNeSS|, #ndiswrapper
[07:13] <christian1222> h08817: oh, 2
[07:14] <cafuego> Yodabunny: I'm talking about people who can NOT run through a wizard by themselves.
[07:14] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: That is correct.
[07:14] <h08817> christian1222, ok and check the size of drive C:
[07:14] <cafuego> Yodabunny: There are LOTS of them... quite sad...
[07:14] <christian1222> h08817: it says 55 i believe
[07:14] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, lol .. errm, what is that correct to?? the inside interface or the outisde interface ??
[07:14] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I just checked the /etc/networks and /etc/network/interfaces files; I don't see a gateway defined.  It should be 74.0.125.25
[07:14] <christian1222> h08817: im in the middle of setup, so im trying to remember
[07:14] <Yodabunny> cafuego I agree.  That being said, a lot of people that can go through a wizard can't manage a linux distribution
[07:15] <h08817> christian1222, o ok so its the biggest im thinking
[07:15] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Public.
[07:15] <h08817> christian1222, so you just have to remove the 10.5 and format it
[07:15] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, well yea -- every host on that network ought to have a default gateway -- otherwise they wont be able to get on the net
[07:15] <SilentDis> christian1222:  you can list out your partitions easily.  fdisk -l
[07:15] <cafuego> Yodabunny: But only due to lack of confidence; if there was decentish documentation they'd be fine.
[07:15] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, just to verify -- can .28 get on the internet
[07:15] <un_operateur1> ?
[07:15] <osah> Hi guys can someone guide me how to setup Flash PLayer 9.0 on linux ?
[07:15] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I think the OEM Kubuntu installer missed that question.
[07:15] <christian1222> h08817: how do i do that?
[07:15] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes; the machine I'm IRCing from is .28
[07:15] <h08817> christian1222, if you format the 10.5 you can put linux on there
[07:15] <osah> i mean is there a .deb
[07:16] <SilentDis> !flash9 _ osah
[07:16] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[07:16] <SilentDis> oops... that won't work...
[07:16] <h08817> christian1222, select the 10.5 and at the bottom of the screen select delete partition
[07:16] <Yodabunny> cafuego but most people don't want to know how it works, or figure out how it works, they want it to just work, or at the very least ask them simple questions
[07:16] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, ok, well, add the default gateway -- and then restart networking -- we'll try again then
[07:16] <SilentDis> !flash9 | osah
[07:16] <Ubotwo> osah: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[07:16] <osah> !backports
[07:16] <Ubotwo> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[07:16] <cafuego> Yodabunny: Yes, a matter of confidence (or possibly even laziness).
[07:17] <rcrook> I am off to clean the kitchen.. back later. :)
[07:17] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: This is me again - pr3d4t0r in Russian.
[07:17] <kd7swh> flash 9 is bugy in my firefox install
[07:17] <Yodabunny> cafuego with linux you generally aren't asked questions, it's not neccessarily linux's issue, it's usually the hardware/software providers issue, but the user doesn't care about that
[07:17] <christian1222> h08817: alright, should I go back to windows and check the D: and see if I have any files on there, I dont think I do, but I think thats what the 10.5 is
[07:17] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I'm going to bounce .28; I added a gateway line to /etc/network/intarfaces for that NIC.
[07:17] <h08817> christian1222, well
[07:17] <Dusters> wtf is this
[07:17] <Dusters> lol
[07:17] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: pr3d4t0r will be disconnected when I bounce the machine.
[07:17] <christian1222> h08817: im going to go check it real quick, and then ill ping you
[07:18] <SilentDis> osah:  I just pulled the beta from adobe's website and extracted the .so.  was pretty simple *shrug* :)
[07:18] <h08817> ok
[07:18] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: And I'll use those two minutes to get back to my desk :)
[07:18] <christian1222> h08817: are you going to be around for about 10 minutes?
[07:18] <h08817> yeah can be
[07:18] <christian1222> h08817: thanks a bunch

[07:19] <Dusters> lol
[07:19] <danl> Does anyone else have a problem where if you move an icon for an application launcher on the gnome bar, it looses all the information and you have to edit the properties to restore the icon, command path, title and comment?
[07:19] <tonyyarusso> !offtopic | Dusters
[07:19] <Ubotwo> Dusters: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[07:19] <tonyyarusso> In short, no.
[07:19] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, pr3d4t0r ok .. let me know when you are done
[07:19] <SilentDis> h08817:  ask away, someone should be able to help you... or at least point you in the right direction :)
[07:20] <h08817> my vlc will not play video when i try to play wmv only plays audio
[07:20] <julian__> i have a question for you all if you care to answer... can an object be alone?
[07:20] <SilentDis> lol tony
[07:20] <tonyyarusso> Dusters: If you're new here, read (and follow) the IRC Guidelines and the Code of Conduct.
[07:20] <SilentDis> julian__:  is this one of those "what is the sound of one hand clapping" questions?  O.o
[07:21] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: can you think of any where you would see SKIP="--skip-networking" in a cf file fot mysql?
[07:21] <danl> h08817: any wmv? I only run into this problem for wmv with drm
[07:21] <julian__> well i was washing dishes and my brother said that my bike was "alone"
[07:21] <cmt^^> I'm trying to install JVM on my machine, but what package do I download/install? There are several candidates if I do 'sudo apt-get install java-virtual-machine'. Which one should I pick?
[07:21] <julian__> i thought about it, and i told him thats not possible
[07:21] <h08817> danl, well in firefox i can't play wmv so i installed the mediaplayer in there that auto opens vlc
[07:21] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, let me check
[07:21] <JustNew> hey all. how do i configure Apache to change the directory?
[07:21] <h08817> danl, it plays audio for me just not video
[07:22] <julian__> what do you think
[07:22] <tonyyarusso> julian__: Unless you mean a programming type of "object" that you're having trouble with in Ubuntu, that's offtopic.  And, -offtopic is better for programming questions anyway.
[07:22] <christian1222> h08817: ok, so apparently my D: is titled ACERDATA
[07:22] <h08817> christian1222, ok
[07:22] <julian__> or you could use the energy spent on that comment to simply reply
[07:23] <julian__> its not hurting anyone
[07:23] <christian1222> h08817: the brand is Acer, i think this is the 10.5 gig partition
[07:23] <christian1222> h08817: but under windows, it days its only 9.75 gigs
[07:23] <Jay2> does anybody here have experience with scanners
[07:23] <h08817> christian1222, yeah its ok some of it gets reserved
[07:23] <christian1222> h08817: with 7.84 free
[07:23] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, it says --  # Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on # localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure. bind-address            = 127.0.0.1
[07:23] <SilentDis> !anyone | Jay2
[07:23] <Ubotwo> Jay2: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[07:23] <nex_06> OK, thanks for the pointers.  I should be good at this point.
[07:24] <h08817> christian1222, ok well you could put linux on there
[07:24] <pr3d4t0r> Greetings.
[07:24] <Jay2> Ubotwo: I already did, no response
[07:24] <Ubotwo> Jay2: Error: "I" is not a valid command.
[07:24] <christian1222> h08817: the C: is 46 gigs, 12.5 free
[07:25] <christian1222> christian1222: should I try to partition it using Windows?
[07:25] <illpoof> !paste
[07:25] <Ubotwo> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:25] <SilentDis> quick question:  old laptop, P1 300, 64mb ram, 4gb hd... xubuntu material or not?
[07:25] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: so if I have 0.0.0.0 it should be listening on port 3306 from any ip correct?
[07:25] <h08817> christian1222, u don't have to use windows to partition it the installer partitioner is just fine
[07:25] <Madpilot> SilentDis, doorstop? ;)  Xubuntu should run; let us know if it does!
[07:25] <christian1222> ok
[07:25] <h08817> thats what i used
[07:26] <Jay2> having a problem with xsane, get an error message when I start it up, using a Benq 124out
[07:26] <SilentDis> madpilot:  I'm running DSL (damn small linux) on it right now... and it's a bit... umm... unfriendly, at best :P
[07:26] <barata> hi cyzie, how is your grub now?
[07:26] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, I dont require my mysql server to be network capable tho :)
[07:26] <h08817> danl, any ideas for vlc?
[07:26] <christian1222> h08817: heres another question, i downloaded the 6.10 iso image, and burned it on a cd, tried to boot it, and for some reason, the only option is to boot ubuntu live cd
[07:26] <Madpilot> SilentDis, you'll want to get the alternate iso of xubuntu, in any case.
[07:26] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Could you please check http://74.0.125.28 ?
=== Kimahri is now known as Tidus
[07:27] <h08817> christian1222, ok so.....
[07:27] <SilentDis> Madpilot:  i figured that much.  no biggie though :)
[07:27] <Madpilot> christian1222, no option to check the CD for errors or anything?
[07:27] <TGPO> SilentDis: I think I'd slap debian on it with no X server and turn it into a webserver
[07:27] <christian1222> Madpilot: I dont know how to check for errors, but I suppose that could be it, would the cd run at all in that case?
[07:27] <h08817> well live cd will not do anything for you it will let you try out linux without installing it
[07:28] <JustNew> HI all. How do I use the Browser in Ubuntu with root privellages?
[07:28] <illpoof> http://rafb.net/paste/results/TXxQ5s84.html <-- why i get this error ?
[07:28] <pr3d4t0r> Hrm...
[07:28] <christian1222> h08817: i know, so i just resorted to using the 5.10 disk i made a while ago
[07:28] <SilentDis> tgpo:  eh, I keep it next to me, and would prefer to use it for IM chat and IRC really
[07:28] <barata> anybody uses transcode extensively?
[07:28] <h08817> wow 5.10
[07:28] <hendrickvp> un_operateur1: but if you were, like in my case, would that be correct?
[07:28] <Madpilot> christian1222, the basic menu on the livecd should have 'run/install Ubuntu', 'Check this CD for errors', and a couple of other options on the first menu you see
[07:28] <h08817> christian1222, what version is that?
[07:28] <SilentDis> tgpo:  the server is a FreeBSD 5.4 box sitting in my closet rofl
[07:28] <h08817> christian1222, hoary?
[07:29] <TGPO> SilentDis: that works too ... for both comments
[07:29] <h08817> christian1222, or breezy?
[07:29] <pr3d4t0r> OKi, nmap from a server at 74.0.125.26 to .28 shows something weird.  It's showing all the NetBIOS ports as filtered.
[07:29] <christian1222> h08817: Im not sure, its old though, I think it is the one before breezy
[07:29] <h08817> ok that is what i have
[07:29] <illpoof> http://rafb.net/paste/results/TXxQ5s84.html <-- why i get this error ?
[07:29] <h08817> i have hoary
[07:29] <pr3d4t0r> That Ubuntu box is not even running Samba, and iptables isn't loaded.  Is it possible that there is some other firewall-like kernel module that's running on it and started automagically?
[07:29] <Madpilot> christian1222, that would be Hoary - and the pre-Dapper LiveCDs had no install option, just 'run this livecd"

[07:30] <christian1222> Madpilot: im booting the 6.10 cd right now to check
[07:30] <niru> what is the command to remove a part of sentence from a file
[07:30] <h08817> christian1222, what options do u get when u boot to the cd? to press enter to install or server for small install?

[07:30] <TGPO> SilentDis: Gaim isnt working for you?
[07:30] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, if i wanted networking i would use 0.0.0.0
[07:30] <niru> I have a list of packages name in a file

[07:30] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, are you there?
[07:30] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I'm here.
[07:30] <karma> Why isn't Gnash in Edgy's Universe repos anymore?
[07:31] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: You can do IRC and IM without X of course.  Web browsing and e-mail too :P
[07:31] <niru> I want to remove the version numbers from al l package names
[07:31] <Madpilot> christian1222, nope, given that I've never heard of iPilot
[07:31] <niru> what command I should give
[07:31] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: There's got to be something in the box blocking connections.  Everything else checks out.

[07:31] <christian1222> Madpilot: just checking
[07:31] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: There's got to be something else blocking connections.
[07:31] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, is it possible you can draw out a quick diagram of the network layout ??
[07:31] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Sure.
[07:31] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  yeah.  i'd like it to have SOME value outside that... maybe freeing my main 'puter from playing MP3s when I'm in SWG would be nice lol

[07:32] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, GIF or PNG please

[07:32] <SilentDis> I'd be more than happy with it running gaim, xchat/bitchx-gtk, and xmms really :)

[07:33] <christian1222> h08817: that was with the 5.10 disk

[07:35] <h08817> christian1222, so what do u want to do

[07:35] <SilentDis> JustNew:  in the interest of answering your question <alt>-<f2> gksudo nautilus
[07:35] <JustNew> so, I figured id play into their default one, but i can write to it!
[07:35] <christian1222> h08817: let me try the 5.10 disk again
[07:36] <SilentDis> JustNew:  might be better to either configure apache to use a different directory, or give yourself write permissions (add yourself to the user group for that folder)
[07:36] <JustNew> SilentDis: i dont know how to confugre apache
[07:36] <a_thing> What's the URL of the main APT repo?

[07:37] <tonyyarusso> JustNew: Hold on - apache question; let me scroll up
[07:37] <SilentDis> JustNew:  because you can cause some SERIOUS damage with a root nautilus window, and not have ANY real way to undo it :P
[07:37] <SilentDis> !apache | JustNew
[07:37] <Ubotwo> JustNew: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[07:37] <SilentDis> that's not very helpful ubotwo :P
[07:37] <tonyyarusso> JustNew: You definitely do NOT want to run the File Browser in Gnome as root.  Bad things happen.
[07:38] <JustNew> ok thanks for the tip :D
[07:38] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: Please don't recommend that, even though it's what he asked ;)
[07:38] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, I am back
[07:38] <tonyyarusso> JustNew: What do you mean by "use my own directory"?  What are you trying to accomplish overall?
[07:39] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  yeah, it's not something I recommend, and I tried to let him know that.  lol
[07:39] <len> has anyone installed openoffice 2.1 on ubuntu?

[07:40] <christian1222> h08817: so how would I go about creating a partition for ubuntu?
[07:40] <tonyyarusso> JustNew: Do you want it to be the regular top-level directory, and just need to know how to write to it, or you want to set up Apache to use a different directory for some other reason?
[07:40] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  background:  JustNew installed apache.  needs to either move apache's directory pointer to his ~, or add himself to the usergroup for the default install folder
[07:40] <h08817> christian1222, can i pm u?
[07:40] <christian1222> h08817: sure
[07:40] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: easy enough.

[07:41] <Jay2> having a problem with xsane, get an error message when I start it up, using a Benq 124out - anybody versed with scanners???

[07:42] <arrenlex> corvette: libqt3-mt-dev
[07:42] <corevette> arrenlex, when i go to synaptic i get this: libqt3-mt-dev:
[07:42] <corevette>  Depends: libglu1-mesa-dev but it is not going to be installed or
[07:42] <corevette> 	libglu-dev
[07:42] <arrenlex> illpoof: Because your packages are trying to overwrite each others' files.
[07:43] <illpoof> so what now ?
[07:43] <arrenlex> corevette: Try installing kdebase-dev
[07:43] <corevette> arrenlex, kdebase-dev:
[07:43] <corevette>  Depends: kdelibs4-dev but it is not going to be installed
[07:43] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Reload; I missed one connection there.
[07:43] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, ok
[07:43] <arrenlex> illpoof: ...are you trying to install kanotix on ubuntu?
[07:43] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: The diagram is up-to-date now.
[07:43] <SilentDis> corevette:  aargh, I just had something VERY similar... I think I rolled back to my old list and did a quick update...
[07:43] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: Hehe, I'm just learning.  Bought a box to use as a server in Sept - been having all kinds of fun.
[07:44] <corevette> SilentDis, so how did you do it?
[07:44] <arrenlex> corevette: Could you please run the commands in terminal? That is more familiar to me so I can help you better. apt-get install kdebase-dev
[07:44] <illpoof> lol
[07:44] <illpoof> no
[07:45] <corevette> arrenlex, The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[07:45] <corevette>   kdebase-dev: Depends: kdelibs4-dev (>= 4:3.5.3) but it is not going to be installed
[07:45] <corevette> E: Broken packages
[07:45] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  uptime on my bsd box is something like 4 months now... and I know I did the install way way before that rofl
[07:45] <arrenlex> corevette: and if you run apt-get install kdelibs4-dev?
[07:45] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: My uptime is terrible, my clock keeps stopping and I don't know why.
[07:45] <corevette> arrenlex,The following packages have unmet dependencies:

[07:45] <arrenlex> ...
[07:46] <arrenlex> corevette: That is really odd. Are you on dapper or edgy?
[07:46] <corevette> edgy
[07:46] <SilentDis> !pastebin | corevette
[07:46] <Ubotwo> corevette: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:46] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, are you sure .25 is on the right interface dude?
[07:46] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  odd.  dead battery?
[07:46] <arrenlex> corevette: What happens if you run "aptitude -t edgy install kdelibs4-dev"?
[07:46] <corevette> sorry silentdis, i feel really lazy, i normally do
[07:46] <corevette> it just the channel doesn't seem much active
[07:46] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Hrm...
[07:46] <arrenlex> corevette: Yeah, only 824 people. It's a lull.
[07:46] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: It should be.
[07:47] <SilentDis> tonyyarusso:  this box is rarely up more than 2 hrs currently.... I can't wait for my new PSU to show up *sigh*
[07:47] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, are you sure it shouldnt be on the inside ??
[07:47] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes.
[07:47] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, because its on the outside now
[07:47] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: I'm not sure.  I would think if it's dead it would happen right away, but I had an uptime of ten days and then it drops to a crawl, and then a halt, pretty suddenly.  IBM sent me a new cmos battery, and I just put that in the last time, so we'll see if it helps.
[07:47] <corevette> arrenlex, it installs it
[07:47] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: 25 is outside.
[07:47] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: PSU?
[07:47] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: 25 - 30 are outside.
[07:47] <arrenlex> corevette: Really now. That is very, very odd.
[07:47] <SilentDis> corevette:  no worries.  I think you're sources.list got fscked, like mine did, from what you're saying.
[07:47] <arrenlex> corevette: I assume you haven't pinned anything?
[07:47] <corevette> arrenlex, no
[07:48] <corevette> arrenlex, any resolution on how to fix this
[07:48] <corevette> arrenlex so synaptic is easier
[07:48] <arrenlex> corevette: If I were you I would regenerate my sources.list and then apt-get update...
[07:48] <arrenlex> corevette: Hold up.
[07:48] <SilentDis> tonyyaruso:  Power Supply Unit.  the doohicky with all the power thingamabobs :D  lol
[07:48] <corevette> how do you regenerate sources.list arrenlex
[07:48] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: Oh, duh.
[07:49] <arrenlex> corevette: Run this (huge) command:        sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak && sudo echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse" > /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update
[07:49] <arrenlex> corevette: That is all one command.
[07:49] <arrenlex> corevette: Wait!
[07:49] <arrenlex> corevette: Run this (huge) command:        sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak && sudo echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse" > /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update
[07:49] <arrenlex> That one. ^
[07:49] <SilentDis> tonyyaruso:  it's a 400w one, I've been running an AMD chip, modern nvidia card, 3 hard drives, 2 cd drives on it... and I'm a smoker.  I'm getting tons of random odd crashes... it was the only other thing I hadn't checked.  I dropped in a friends in a temp fasion, and everything stopped crashing.  got a 680w on order :)
[07:49] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, but you've got .26 and .28 there on the inside -- i dont understand
[07:50] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: No, .26 and .28 are on the outside.
[07:50] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: If it's .25 - .30 is outside.,
[07:50] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: If it's 192* is inside.
[07:50] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: ah.
[07:50] <harry> how do i install VLC media player via apt-get tool?
[07:50] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Those machines have two NICs, one for inside, one for outside.
[07:51] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, can i assume that the machines .26 and .28 connect upto the router via ethernet??
[07:51] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes.
[07:51] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: 100B/T
[07:51] <arrenlex> corevette: How'd it go?
[07:51] <SilentDis> !info vlc
[07:51] <Ubotwo> vlc - multimedia player and streamer - available in Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) - See http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for more information
[07:51] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, and .25 is assigned to the interface that connects to DSL or cable??
[07:51] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes.
[07:52] <SilentDis> harry:  should be sudo apt-get install vlc
[07:52] <corevette> arrenlex: mv: cannot stat `/etc/apt/sources.list': No such file or directory
[07:52] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, ok, is there any kind of routing/NAT happening between .26 and .28?
[07:52] <arrenlex> corevette: ... did you run them both?
[07:53] <corevette> no just the last one arrenlex
[07:53] <arrenlex> corevette: You weren't supposed to. xD
[07:53] <arrenlex> corevette: Oh.
[07:53] <arrenlex> corevette: I don't see how that's possible. o_o
[07:53] <corevette> your telling me arrenlex
[07:53] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Hrm...
[07:54] <arrenlex> corevette: Okay.... do this:                sudo echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse" > /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update
[07:54] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yeah, there could be.
[07:54] <arrenlex> corevette: "you're". Your is possessive.
[07:54] <harry> SilentDis: how come i can't play video
[07:54] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: .28 has 192.168.0.240, gateway 192.168.0.138
[07:54] <corevette> arrenlex: sudo echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse" > /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update
[07:54] <arrenlex> corevette: Yes, run that command.
[07:54] <corevette> arrenlex lets not get started on misspelling in online culture
[07:54] <SilentDis> harry:  what app are you using, what kind of vid file is it, what error do you get?
[07:55] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: That's for eth1; eth0 is 74.0.125.28, gateway 74.0.125.25
[07:55] <corevette> arrenlex: bash: /etc/apt/sources.list: Permission denied
[07:55] <arrenlex> corevette: If no one does it, there will be nothing left of it. And it's grammar, not spelling.
[07:55] <arrenlex> ...what. o_O
[07:55] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: The other box has eth0 74.0.125.26, gateway 74.0.125.25
[07:55] <harry> SilentDis: .mkv video
[07:56] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: That's why I asked what the contents of /etc/networks should be.
[07:56] <harry> SilentDis: do you know a media player that plays a .mkv extension file?
[07:56] <SilentDis> harry:  I haven't run into .mkv yet...
[07:56] <SilentDis> !mkv

[07:56] <corevette> arrenlex: if you haven't found out, sources.list doesn't exist anymore
[07:56] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Somehow having a separate gateway for each NIC may not make sense.
[07:56] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, well, ok -- i must admit i'm a little bit confused here
[07:56] <arrenlex> corevette: What the hell. How about this command?         sudo wget http://arrenlex.diff.be/sources.list -O/etc/apt/sources.list
[07:56] <FunnyLookinHat> How do I change the password for the default profile on the keyring?  I accidently made it my wep key, lol...  way too long
[07:56] <un_operateur1> hold on a sec -- let me draw this out again
[07:57] <arrenlex> corevette: I got that part. It shouldn't exist for my command.
[07:57] <corevette> arrenlex: that worked
[07:57] <SilentDis> harry:  it's apparently part of the restricted formats.  follow that first link from ubotwo :)
[07:57] <arrenlex> corevette: now run sudo apt-get update.
[07:57] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, are 74.0.125.28 and 192.168.0.240 on the same interface or different interfaces??
[07:58] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: eth0 and eth1, respectively.
[07:58] <corevette> arrenlex
[07:58] <corevette> arrenlex: ok
[07:58] <arrenlex> corevette: Things should work now.
[07:58] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I'm about to reboot .28 once more.  I'm here as xi5hnik.
[07:58] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, I suppose the same goes for  74.0.125.26 and 192.168.0.138 eh?
[07:59] <corevette> thanks i'll check it out arrenlex
[07:59] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, read above ^^
[07:59] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yes.
[07:59] <the_rick> Hi all.  I'm new to Ubuntu and fairly new to Linux.  Wondering what is the easiest way to configure my firewall in Ubuntu?
[07:59] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Machines with more than one IP address have more than one NIC, one for each.
[07:59] <the_rick> Previously I used Suse and Yast made things fairly simple for me
[07:59] <SilentDis> !firewall | the_rick
[07:59] <Ubotwo> the_rick: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[07:59] <nzhomie> the_rick, get a program from synaptic package manager called firestarter
[08:00] <the_rick> Thank you both
[08:00] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, all this tells me that .26, .27, .28, .29 and .30 are on one physical segment .. and .25 is on its own .. am i correct?
[08:00] <harry> !mkv
[08:00] <Ubotwo> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[08:00] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Correct.
[08:01] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Well, correct in as much as there is separation within the router.
[08:01] <corevette> arrenlex, same problem
[08:01] <corevette> arrenlex, i'll put output in pastebin
[08:01] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I have little visibility into that router.
[08:01] <SilentDis> ubotwo knows all.
[08:01] <Ubotwo> SilentDis: Error: "knows" is not a valid command.
[08:01] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, if that is correct -- then .26 and .28 are on the inside and .25 is on the outside -- let's verify that
[08:01] <corevette> arrenlex, ignore the first 3 lines: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37701/
[08:01] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, head on over to http://whatismyip.com  .. what is the IP address you see there?
[08:02] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Let's say that .26 and .28 are in the "middle".  The inside is the 192.168.0.* network.
[08:02] <SilentDis> ok... so he doesn't have good error handling.  rofl
[08:02] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: .26
[08:02] <arrenlex> corevette: You did something very, very weird to your system.
[08:02] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, try the other machines -- do you get the same address?
[08:02] <arrenlex> corevette: Have you messed with third-party repositories?
[08:03] <corevette> why thank you arrenlex
[08:03] <corevette> arrenlex, not much
[08:03] <arrenlex> corevette: ...not much, eh.
[08:03] <corevette> arrenlex, i did add a compiz one a while ago, but i deleted
[08:03] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I'm about to try.
[08:03] <sidny4> I have ubuntu 6.06 x86 using the k7 kernel installed on my desktop that has an Athlon 64 in it. Problem is the system keeps halting, anyone know why?
[08:04] <SilentDis> corevette:  please, oh please, tell me you didn't play with TEH EVIL
[08:04] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, cool :)
[08:04] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: All the machines with 192.168.0.* will give you .26 because that's their gateway.
[08:04] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Let me try .28 but that's a headless machine.
[08:04] <corevette> i have no clue what the evil is...unless compiz is the evil silentdis
[08:05] <corevette> arrenlex, the only thing in sources.list is: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse
[08:05] <SilentDis> alright, to bed with me.  g'night all :)
[08:05] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, so far so good -- that is expected
[08:05] <arrenlex> corevette: I know. I made it that way.
[08:05] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: <h1>Your IP Is 74.0.125.28</h1>
[08:05] <arrenlex> corevette: Do this: sudo wget http://arrenlex.diff.be/preferences -O/etc/apt/preferences && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[08:05] <corevette> arrenlex, uhh thank you
[08:05] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I fixed it.
[08:06] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I know what the problem was.
[08:06] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: space between -O and /etc?
[08:06] <corevette> why are you downgrading everything arrenlex
[08:06] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: eth0 and eth1 each defined a gateway.
[08:06] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I turned eth1 off.
[08:06] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, :) :))
[08:06] <arrenlex> corevette: I'm downgrading everything to edgy packages because you got newer versions from somewhere which conflict when you try to get edgy packages.
[08:06] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, so can i try connecting to .28 now?
[08:06] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: So the packets were probably running in circles trying to fiture out where to go.
[08:06] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yup.
[08:06] <sidny4> I have ubuntu 6.06 x86 using the k7 kernel installed on my desktop that has an Athlon 64 in it. Problem is the system keeps halting, anyone know why?
[08:06] <arrenlex> corevette: Your problem with kdebase-dev from edgy was that it expected packages from edgy, but you had newer.
[08:06] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: http://74.0.125.28
[08:07] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, yes, it works :)
[08:07] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: That was it.
[08:07] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I wonder where I ought to submit the bug :)
[08:07] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, for your reference -- .25 is on the inside eh .. it has to be
[08:07] <False_Courage> Goodnight you all!
[08:07] <arrenlex> corevette: ...unless you were messing with feisty or something? I still don't understand where you got newer packages.
[08:07] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I think that's a bug in the Kubuntu AMD OEM installer.  That's how that machine wound up with two gateways.
[08:07] <corevette> arrenlex your guess is as good as mine
[08:07] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, the outside interface _must_ have a different IP address for routing to work properly
[08:08] <corevette> arrenlex i'm 2 months into linux
[08:08] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I don't follow.
[08:08] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: .25 is exposed to the world.
[08:08] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: How can that be on the inside?
[08:08] <arrenlex> corevette: Glad you stuck around! How are you finding it? :)
[08:08] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: .25 - .30 are exposed to the world.
[08:08] <the_rick> !dhcp
[08:08] <Ubotwo> dhcp - DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment - available in Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) - See http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for more information
[08:08] <miniman_> omg
[08:08] <miniman_> someone please help
[08:08] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, .25 is exposed to the world only because there'sa  routing protocol in operation on the router that allows the world access to that subnet
[08:08] <corevette> excellent, i'm having a little trouble with grub, but thats the least of my worries
[08:09] <corevette> compared to this
[08:09] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Ah, yeah.
[08:09] <tonyyarusso> !helpme | miniman_
[08:09] <Ubotwo> miniman_: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:09] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: It's plugged to a different WAN, owned by Covad.
[08:09] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, if you had .25 on the outside interface -- routing would simply not work
[08:09] <corevette> i'm starting to compile more arrenlex, and when i started compiling ktorrent beta, this came up
[08:09] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: So I understand now what you meant by inside/outside.
[08:09] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Er...
[08:09] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: That's how I made it work.
[08:09] <miniman_> OKAY, I tried to get my radeon card to work , and it didnt work, now I cant boot into abuntu at all, how can reset the xorg to default so I can boot again?
[08:09] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: By defining .25 as the outside NIC gateway.
[08:10] <arrenlex> corevette: Normally you would cut your compiling teeth when everything is ideal... I'm sorry you ran into this so early.
[08:10] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=120
[08:10] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, well, I have a feeling you do not know what your real outisde network interface address is -- your ISP/router might call .25 an outside address but infact it's just like a gatway for the inside network
[08:10] <arrenlex> corevette: That is to say, I lost my compiling virginity on kmess, which was (no pun intended) an absolute mess. Compiling it was hell. I'm amazed I got through it.
[08:11] <arrenlex> corevette: And it also sucked so I deleted it after two minutes, but oh well. :)
[08:11] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Let me look at the router config.
[08:11] <corevette> arrenlex haha nice
[08:11] <corevette> arrenlex, this is probably my first compling
[08:12] <corevette> arrenlex can you answer a question really quick
[08:12] <arrenlex> corevette: ask away.
[08:12] <sidny4> if my system halts, is there a way to see what caused to halt after I restart the computer?
[08:12] <arrenlex> sidny4: /var/log/messages
[08:13] <sidny4> ok
[08:13] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, ok
[08:13] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I guess what you call "outside" is Covad's WAN, to which I'm connected to.
[08:13] <corevette> arrenlex, i have one hard drive ubuntu linux w/ grub, and another with windows xp.  the only way for me to change hard drives on boot is to physically unplug the other hard drive i'm not using
[08:13] <miniman_> I tried to get my radeon card to work , and it didnt work, now I cant boot into abuntu at all, how can reset the xorg to default so I can boot again?
[08:13] <corevette> arrenlex, how do i get grub to load when i have both plugged in
[08:13] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: So by connecting to that they route my traffic from wherever to 74.0.125.*
[08:13] <corevette> arrenlex, i'm guessing its a jumper problem?
[08:13] <arrenlex> corevette: You'd have to install grub to the primary hard drive.
[08:13] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, by outisde i mean the link that connects to your ISP -- it must have adifferent IP addressing scheme to that of your "inside" network
=== Kimahri is now known as Tidus
[08:13] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yes, it does.
[08:13] <corevette> arrenlex, so install it to windows?
[08:14] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: that's the WAN address I talk about.
[08:14] <arrenlex> corevette: Grub is installed into MBR, not into an operating system.
[08:14] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: So now I understand what you meant.
[08:14] <corevette> so how would i do it arrenlex
[08:14] <arrenlex> corevette: I think it would work if you made your linux hard drive your primary hard drive and put windows on the secondary drive.
[08:14] <arrenlex> corevette: Then all you would have to do is reconfigure grub to find windows.
[08:14] <corevette> is that with slaves? arrenlex
[08:15] <arrenlex> corevette: I don't know. I've never had more than one hard drive and have only opened my case once. :(
[08:15] <arrenlex> :$
[08:15] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Thanks very much for your help.  I'm going to start cleaning up this mess :)
[08:15] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, usually how routers work is -- the external/WAN interface has a /30 address -- 2 addresses on this subnet connect you and your ISP up together -- your side of the router advertises your "inside" /29 network to the ISP -- and thats how the world gets to know how to get to your network
[08:15] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yeah.
[08:15] <corevette> arrenlex ok i'll ask around - btw everythings unpacking...just thought id give you the update
[08:15] <arrenlex> corevette: I'm picturing it as Linux on /dev/hda and Windows on /dev/hdb. Dunno how to put that into hardware terms.
[08:15] <arrenlex> corevette: Alright.
[08:16] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I was just confused by your use of "outside" vs. "inside".  I'm (erroneously?) used to thinking of outside == 74.* and inside == 192.168.*
[08:16] <lynucs> hi@all
[08:16] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, theres a law with routers -- 2 or more interfaces cannot have IP addresses in the same IP subnet
[08:16] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: That's why we had that disconnect.  Plus I know enough about networking without being a router guru :(
[08:16] <arrenlex> !hi | lynucs
[08:16] <Ubotwo> lynucs: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:16] <corevette> do you think downgrading will mess things up in any way arrenlex?
[08:16] <lynucs> anyone uses enlightenment??
[08:16] <miniman_> How do you reset xorg config to default?
[08:16] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, well, thats convention brought about by SOHO users -- inside/outside can mean anything really
[08:16] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: :)
[08:17] <arrenlex> corevette: No. The versions are the same except that you have -ubuntu3.2 where you should have -ubuntu3.
[08:17] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, i suggest you lower the metric on the gateway for 192.168.* on your hosts
[08:17] <corevette> gotcha arrenlex
[08:17] <arrenlex> corevette: I would be surprised if the packages were not binary compatible for the most part. I have no idea where you got these.
[08:17] <un_operateur1> that way, the 70.* gateway gets a priority
[08:17] <webar7> in IE on windoze when I'm offline I can "browse" websites from my cache history (IE seems to have a builtin cache or something) how can I do that with Ubuntu ... firefox seems not to do this do I need to install some proxy or something
[08:17] <un_operateur1> sorry -- raise the metric -- not lower it ... :p
[08:17] <webar7> this is a laptop
[08:18] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: What do you mean "lower your metric"?
[08:18] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Oh, that.  Yes, that's set up that way.
[08:18] <P3nnywise> Is there a program that can record everything on your screen in ubuntu?
[08:19] <webar7> so i wanna run as little software as possible
[08:19] <webar7> yes
[08:19] <arrenlex> P3nnywise: xvidcap, istanbul, recordmydesktop...
[08:19] <webar7> well in X
[08:19] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: There is a separate switch there for internal traffic, etc.  Then I have iptables rules that help with the router in each gateway (.26, .28).
[08:19] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, each gateway has an IP metric associated with it to suggest to the IP stack the cost for using the parituclar link -- the lower the metric the better the link
[08:19] <arrenlex> P3nnywise: In approximately decreasing order or recommendation.
[08:19] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yes.
[08:19] <P3nnywise> recommendation
[08:19] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: That's how the .26 machine is configured.  .28 will eventually be configured that way and replace .26 altogether.
[08:19] <arrenlex> P3nnywise: Is what I say. No?
[08:20] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, what i really meant was -- raise the metrics for those links connected to the 192.168.* network -- thereby making them less suitable
[08:20] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Right now there is nothing on .28 - I just wanted the bloody SSH to work :)
[08:20] <webar7> you might even be able to record directly to youtube now :-)
[08:20] <miniman_> Does anyone know how to restore xorg config?
[08:20] <webar7> flash will pull video from your webcam
[08:20] <arrenlex> miniman_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:20] <webar7> so if you fiddle with gstreamer
[08:20] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, it ought to work now :)
[08:20] <webar7> it might work
[08:20] <arrenlex> miniman_: Unless you have a backup, in which case use that.
[08:20] <miniman_> arrenlex: THank you, you saved me from having to format
[08:20] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yeah, it's working fine.
[08:20] <miniman_> i love you
[08:20] <miniman_> lol
[08:21] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Seriously now.  Where do I file a bug report with Kubuntu for the OEM installer?
[08:21] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I think this whole issue was caused by the installer allowing two different gateway definitions, one for each NIC.
[08:21] <lynucs> btw guys which irc client are you using?
[08:21] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: That was the problem.  By removing the second one, everything works like a charm now.
[08:21] <cmt^^> irssi ftw
[08:21] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, errm, when you installed kubuntu-- didnt the installer prompt you for 2 different IP configurations??
[08:21] <webar7> there's 40 pick one
[08:22] <cmt^^> !irssi | lynucs
[08:22] <Ubotwo> lynucs: irssi is a command line interface IRC client ( "sudo apt-get install irssi" without the quotes to try it out )
[08:22] <lynucs> hmm
[08:22] <lynucs> i'm just trying xchat
[08:22] <cmt^^> it's awesome in my opinion
[08:22] <lynucs> but nor really enjoiying it
[08:22] <cmt^^> irssi that is
[08:22] <webar7> gaim chatzilla etc
[08:22] <lynucs> hehe, you console freaks :D
[08:22] <cmt^^> powerful and stripped of unneccesary functions
[08:23] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yes.
[08:23] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: That's the problem.
[08:23] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, well, if you were asked for 2 different gateways (one for each interface) that is perfectly valid and intended -- because you might have a host connected upto 2 different ISPs and then you do need that
[08:23] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: You can't define two gateways.
[08:23] <kraut> moin
[08:23] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, ohh yes you can and must be able to
[08:23] <bawnpa> can ubuntu dapper mount openbsd filesystems?
[08:23] <xi5hnik> xi5hnik: Hrm... then it should ask for additional routing information, or whether to define the machine as a bridge, etc.
[08:24] <Flannel> xi5hnik: launchpad.net ultimately.  Not sure which individual package though, I think maybe... debian-installer, if that's a package.  let me look.  yeah: https://launchpad.net/products/debian-installer
[08:24] <xi5hnik> Flannel: Thanks.
[08:24] <arrenlex> lynucs: Don't scoff at the console! Can it do this: chown -R us:us base/ =P (don't run this).
[08:24] <Flannel> xi5hnik: make sure you check to see if it's already filed
[08:24] <arrenlex> Can it do -> look what it can do
[08:24] <opteek> hey guys, I restarted my computer, and I cannot get start an x session, gdm works fine, but when i log in the x server crashes and takes me back to gdm ;(
[08:24] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, the reason why this failed here is only because of the metrics and a loop -- if you had the right setup , this wouldnt have happened
[08:24] <corevette> arrenlex its done with this:E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[08:25] <Flannel> opteek: try the safe mode (under session, choose failsafe)
[08:25] <arrenlex> corevette: ...that does not sound good. -__-
[08:25] <arrenlex> corevette: Pastebin about five lines up.
[08:25] <arrenlex> corevette: As in, five lines up to the bottom.
[08:25] <corevette> arrenlex yeah hold on
[08:25] <boyko> Hey.
[08:25] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: OKi.
[08:25] <boyko> Is this the right room for Ubuntu general chat?
[08:25] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, I hope you arent filing a bug report -- because this isnt a bug eh :)
[08:25] <corevette> arrenlex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37703/
[08:26] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I will document all this in the morning :)
[08:26] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: Yeah.
[08:26] <arrenlex> boyko: If you don't need help, go to #ubuntu-offtopic
[08:26] <Flannel> boyko: chat? no, that'd be #ubuntu-offtopic, ubuntu questions, here.
[08:26] <opteek> how do I start GDM back up, I killed it
[08:26] <boyko> Thank you.
[08:26] <xi5hnik> un_operateur1: I think the bug is in how the questions are asked.
[08:26] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, :)
[08:26] <corevette> arrenlex, i've had those errors with emacs, vmware, etc for a while. i was eventually going to somehow fix them, but i haven't got to them yet
[08:26] <Flannel> opteek: er... You said it takes you back to gdm, does it not?
[08:26] <opteek> Flannel , yeah, but then i killed GDM to try doing startx
[08:26] <arrenlex> corevette: ...that doesn't help me much. Run "apt-get install cedet-common eieio speedbar vmware-player" and pastebin the entire output, please.
[08:26] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: A prompt like "it looks like you're defining a bridge or a gateway" followed by additional fields for that may be a good thing.
[08:26] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, the bug here is how your network is laid out -- 198.* goes back into the switch and back into 192.* on the other host
[08:27] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yeah.
[08:27] <arrenlex> corevette: ...oh wait. Those are third-party packages, aren't they.
[08:27] <corevette> arrenlex yes they are
[08:27] <Flannel> opteek: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[08:27] <preaction-m> if I compile a 2.6.19 kernel for Edgy, will all my programs still work? I need the 2.6.19 for my MacBook Pro
[08:27] <arrenlex> corevette: cedet-common was found in my repo. Run that command and see what happens. Couldn't hurt.
[08:27] <un_operateur1> xi5hnik, if your eth1 has a lower metric (which it should) -- the machine is going to try and send all traffic that way -- and that'll never get outside
[08:28] <arrenlex> preaction-m: Of course. Programs don't depend on the kernel. Drivers do.
[08:28] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes, I can see that now.
[08:28] <preaction-m> arrenlex: thanks
[08:28] <corevette> arrenlex, the apt-get install cedet-common eieio speedbar vmware-player ?
[08:28] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Like electricity through a circuit:  follow the path of least resistance.
[08:28] <opteek> Flannel : it says starting gnome display manager OK but it doesnt... weird
[08:28] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, exactly so
[08:28] <arrenlex> corevette: Yes.
[08:29] <arrenlex> pr3d4t0r: The path of least resistance is a typewriter. :)
[08:29] <pr3d4t0r> arrenlex: He, he, he...
[08:29] <corevette> arrenlex, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37704/
[08:29] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Dude, are y ou the one in the UK?
[08:29] <Flannel> opteek: I have no idea.  you back on tty7? or still on 1?
[08:29] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, yep
[08:29] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Which city?
[08:29] <opteek> Flannel : no, I tried 7
[08:29] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, sheffield
[08:29] <arrenlex> corevette: It's setting up vmware. Follow the instructions please.
[08:30] <arrenlex> corevette: (to set up vmware).
[08:30] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: If you're anywhere near London I'll treat you to Maroush the next time I visit.
[08:30] <Flannel> opteek: well, I don't know.  I have no GUI.  I can tell you restarting will fix it ;)
[08:30] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Ah.
[08:30] <Flannel> opteek: or at least, restart gdm, that is.
[08:30] <opteek> Flannel: Im gonna reboot and try the failsafe
[08:30] <opteek> brb ;)
[08:30] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, heh, i am actually a londoner -- i'm in sheffield only for a short time :)
[08:30] <lynucs> are here ppl who are using SiS M760 onboard graphics?
[08:30] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, whereabouts in london do you live?
[08:30] <corevette> arrenlex, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37705/
[08:30] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Well, Maroush or your favourite place the next time I'm there.
[08:30] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I don't live there :(
[08:31] <radar1976> ok now i'm getting peed off
[08:31] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: My brother has a flat by Hyde Park and I either stay there or at the Thistle Kensignton Park hotel.
[08:31] <radar1976> two dapper -> edgy upgrades failed... now i'm trying to install edgy on a pb laptop and it is telling me that i have no root partition... however i have chosen a / partiton
[08:31] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, ahh i see -- and where do you stay?
[08:31] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Off Kensington Garden/Gloucester.
[08:31] <corevette> arrenlex, and what about the whole sources.list issue
[08:32] <Eko_Hermiyanto> I am using ubuntu system on X86 system
[08:32] <arrenlex> corevette: What issue?
[08:32] <lynucs> the only graphic chips without a proper dri-support outthere are only SiS M760 and 660.. and guess which  chip i have ? arrgghh
[08:32] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, I know that area quite well -- it's near paddington, marble arch right?
[08:32] <Eko_Hermiyanto> when I am using my system for playing mp3 and other multimedia files...
[08:32] <danl> is there a better way to set gmail to your default mail client other than setting the prefered email application to:     firefox -new-tab "http://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=%s&su="
[08:32] <radar1976> everyone raves on how easy ubuntu is... well it is proving that is not easy
[08:32] <Eko_Hermiyanto> I always get the video output is in use by another application error
[08:32] <corevette> arrenlex, how i couldn't install kdedev-lib or whatever
[08:32] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: So... convenient.  Close enough to the Gloucester and High Street tubes.
[08:32] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yup :)
[08:32] <Eko_Hermiyanto> by the way when I am chance my players into other programs..
[08:32] <Eko_Hermiyanto> the result is just same
[08:32] <ganesh_kumar> dudes i cant find ntfs-3g in the synaptic manager how could i get tat?
[08:32] <Eko_Hermiyanto> I have searched trough google ..
[08:32] <rapid_> radar1976, go use slackware then
[08:33] <Eko_Hermiyanto> but can't find satisfied information
[08:33] <Eko_Hermiyanto> any ideas?
[08:33] <arrenlex> danl: Install greasemonkey and then install http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/595
[08:33] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, :) yea, that area is quite cool -- i like going to have sheesha down edgware road :)
[08:33] <radar1976> this isn't distro war... second slackware has no ppc that i know of
[08:33] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: http://eugeneciurana.com/galereya/view_album.php?set_albumName=LondonTrip
[08:33] <arrenlex> corevette: That was the result of your package mismatch, which downgrading has solved.
[08:33] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: You're on.
[08:33] <arrenlex> package version mismatch *
[08:33] <corevette> ok

[08:34] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Are you usually here?
[08:34] <corevette> what was that package called again arrenlex?
[08:34] <arrenlex> corevette: ...what?
[08:34] <ganesh_kumar> dudes i cant find ntfs-3g in the synaptic manager how could i get tat?
[08:34] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, I've only been here for a couple of days .. i usually hang out in #perl
[08:34] <corevette> arrenlex the whole reason i started talking to you..hold on
[08:34] <arrenlex> !ntfs-3g | ganesh_kumar
[08:34] <Ubotwo> ganesh_kumar: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution.

[08:34] <arrenlex> corevette: One thing at a time! Have you finished configuring vmware?
[08:34] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, which one is you among the photos? :)
[08:34] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I added you to my book.  I'll ping you the next time I'm in london.

[08:38] <arrenlex> corevette: Do you really need emacs?
[08:38] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I'm a weird Mexican who lives in San Francisco and who speaks Russian and French.

[08:39] <arrenlex> corevette: Do you need cedet-common, eieio or speedbar at the moment? Can I ask you to remove them and you can reinstall them later if you want?
[08:39] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Sushi is for me what caffeine is for other folks :)

[08:40] <opteek> Jeffm515: My X is not working anymore, I try to login with GDM, but it kicks me back to GDM every time
[08:40] <Jeffm515> nope, that only handles browsers, and email

[08:41] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: He, he, he... you may not have had the good sushi yet.  Either way, Maroush or Sheesha :)

[08:44] <Spaghetti_Knife> On ubuntu?
[08:44] <corevette> arrenlex this encouraged me to stop using vmware
[08:44] <arrenlex> corevette: apt-get remove emacs21 cedet-common eieio speedbar vmware-player
[08:44] <corevette> arrenlex this is why ihaven't attempted to fix it
[08:44] <rajshekhar> no
[08:44] <opteek> .
[08:45] <arrenlex> !quicktime | Spaghetti_Knife
[08:45] <Ubotwo> Spaghetti_Knife: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[08:45] <arrenlex> opteek: ...pardon? Was that period the output?
[08:45] <opteek> Profiles, opteek, pdf-documents, netlogon
[08:45] <IntToStr> can anyone help me with my WiFi woes?
[08:45] <arrenlex> opteek: I'm kind of interested in the full output, not the names. What's the output of ls -ld /home/opteek
[08:45] <arrenlex> opteek: Will only be one line. Paste it.
[08:45] <corevette> arrenlex http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37709/
[08:46] <lynucs> spaghetti, im not sure, but if you want to do it a bit comfortabel, installl automatix2 and try to get the codecs and some players with the help of automatix2
[08:46] <arrenlex> corevette: .....WOW.
[08:46] <opteek> arrenlex it is not one line, it is my whole directory listing
[08:46] <lynucs> but i really don't know wehter it will work with quicktime :D
[08:46] <arrenlex> opteek: It shouldn't be. Did you paste exactly? ls -ld /home/opteek
[08:46] <radar1976> this is not good
[08:47] <opteek> arrenlex oh, my bad, one sec
[08:47] <radar1976> I go thur the stage of partitioning, I have two partitions on the system from dapper... I then chose the mount points.  and the installer says "No Root file system"
[08:47] <radar1976> but / is chosen on a 52gb partiton
[08:47] <radar1976> why why why why
[08:47] <opteek> arrenlex: drwxr-xr-x 58 opteek opteek 4096 2006-12-18 01:33 /home/opteek
[08:47] <kameron> radar1976: you need to enter "/" as the mount point for one of your partitions, where you want all the ubuntu OS files installed.
[08:48] <arrenlex> opteek: Oh, not that then. Sorry, carry on. :)
[08:48] <corevette> arrenlex, how long does compiling usually take
[08:48] <Geoff_Rickly> good morning!
[08:48] <radar1976> kameron  it has / in the mount point
[08:48] <rajshekhar> kameron :no its not on install cd
[08:48] <arrenlex> corevette: Depends on the program. Could take two seconds or a few hours.
[08:48] <radar1976> does it need to have the " ?
[08:48] <kameron> radar1976: oh sorry, i just read your first post
[08:48] <corevette> good morning Geoff_Rickly , may i interest you in a cup of ubuntu blend?
[08:48] <radar1976> try with the "  no change
[08:48] <Geoff_Rickly> corevette: yes plz
[08:48] <Geoff_Rickly> :-)
[08:49] <radar1976> I CAN NOT format the partition
[08:49] <pdiddy_79> trying to set up work email on evolution...i can send but can't receive emails....can anyone please help?
[08:49] <kameron> rajshekhar: use apt-get to calculate dependencies for xmms. then download the binaries for xmms and any dependencies, put it on a medium and then to the other comp where you can install it.
[08:49] <corevette> Geoff_Rickly well so would i
[08:49] <arrenlex> corevette: This might produce better output: sudo dpkg --purge vmware-player
[08:49] <arrenlex> corevette: Pastebin that.
[08:50] <rajshekhar> kameron : from where i can download xmms binaries
[08:51] <kameron> rajshekhar: the binary is just the .deb file that ubuntu downloads when it installs it. are you on an ubuntu system now, or no?
[08:51] <pdiddy_79> error msg says "host lookup failed: localhost: name or service not known"....any ideas greatly appreciated :)
[08:51] <tuxtheslacker> hello. how do I unpackage a .rar file?
[08:51] <corevette> arrenlex, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37710/
[08:51] <tuxtheslacker> unpack*
[08:51] <rajshekhar> kameron  : yes
[08:51] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, you there?
[08:51] <kameron> tuxtheslacker: make sure you have nonfree repos open, and apt-get install unrar
[08:51] <radar1976> the disk is clean..
[08:51] <radar1976> so I'm confused
[08:52] <tuxtheslacker> kameron, thanks
[08:52] <Geoff_Rickly> i have some problems with vmplayer. when i used it, ubuntu won't shut down, because it waits for a vmnet device to become free
[08:52] <Geoff_Rickly> how can i fix that?
[08:52] <_goofy_> when i try to get root access with the su command and enter my user pw it rejects it ......why
[08:52] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Yes, I are :)
[08:52] <kameron> rajshekhar: apt-get install xmms. then "locate xmms | grep deb" to find the deb for it. and i forget the command to just calculate dependencies for apt-get.. "man apt-get" to see what it is. i'm not on ubuntu right now or id check for oyu.
[08:52] <un_operateur1> _goofy_, su is disabled on *buntu
[08:52] <scott__> Anyone here that fairly knowledgeable on xinerama/twinview?  I havent yet found a real good tutorial that makes it easy for me to get it working...been stabbing at my xorg.conf for like 6 hours now....
[08:52] <un_operateur1> you need sudo instead
[08:52] <Madpilot> _goofy_, because Ubuntu is designed to use sudo
[08:52] <un_operateur1> !sudo | _goofy_
[08:52] <Ubotwo> _goofy_: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:52] <Spaghetti_Knife> Okay, i installed mplayer, but quicktime movies aren't playing in browser.
[08:52] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I do it?
[08:52] <arrenlex> corevette: ...that was not helpful.
[08:53] <pr3d4t0r> _goofy_: sudo bash --> almost the same as logging on as root.
[08:53] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, just to let you know i got your PM -- will send you and email shortly :)
[08:53] <arrenlex> Spaghetti_Knife: install mplayer-mozilla
[08:53] <corevette> i know arrenlex
[08:53] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Cool - thanks.
[08:53] <radar1976> well I have a problem.. asked and still no help
[08:53] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: I'm going to sleep - long day tomorrow.
[08:53] <tuxtheslacker> what options do I run to unrar?
[08:53] <corevette> isn't there like a force remove option arrenlex?
[08:53] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, coolies, nice knowin ya :)
[08:53] <Geoff_Rickly> Spaghetti_Knife: and install libquicktime0
[08:53] <arrenlex> corevette: Hold on: sudo /etc/init.d/vmware-player stop
[08:53] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Thanks very much for all your help.  Sheesha or Maroush or wherever - promise.
[08:53] <Spaghetti_Knife> arrenlex: i typed that into the command field, and it didn't do anything.
[08:53] <arrenlex> corevette: Not that I know of off the top of my head.
[08:53] <B_166-ER-X> Can someone help me ?  i try to understand why my Xawtv was working right...now it seems like it has updated , and now, i cannot record :/
[08:53] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, have a good sleep :) sure, we'll chat soon :)
[08:53] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: We have regular real-world ##java gatherings, so you can check I'm good to my word.
[08:54] <pr3d4t0r> un_operateur1: Thanks.  Have an awesome week.
[08:54] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, cool :)
[08:54] <un_operateur1> pr3d4t0r, ciao :)
[08:54] <kameron> tuxtheslacker: unrar e filename.rar
[08:54] <arrenlex> corevette: Aha! It exists. Kill that pig.  sudo dpkg -r --force-remove-reinstreq vmware-player
[08:55] <tuxtheslacker> kameron, thanks.
[08:55] <kameron> tuxtheslacker: np bro
[08:55] <corevette> arrenlex i thought there was one
[08:55] <Spaghetti_Knife> Geoff_Rickly: How do i install that?
[08:56] <IntToStr> could somebody please spare a few mins to help me set up my wireless card? d-link wda - 1320, Atheros chip set.
[08:56] <arrenlex> corevette: Pastebin the output of that, please, even if it looks like it succeeded. Never run that command before and I'm curious as to what it looks like.
[08:57] <corevette> arrenlex, it didn't look like it succeeded http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37712/
[08:57] <rajshekhar> kameron : thanks

[08:57] <rajshekhar> kameron : all xmms deb file are reuired to copy and paste on other comp
[08:57] <kameron> rajshekhar: what?
[08:57] <webar7> in IE on windoze when I'm offline I can "browse" websites from my cache history (IE seems to have a builtin cache or something) how can I do that with Ubuntu ... can't figure out how to do this with ffox so do I need to install some proxy or something ?
[08:57] <arrenlex> corevette: ...amazing.
[08:58] <kameron> rajshekhar: there should be an xmms bin in this folder: /var/cache/apt/archives/
[08:58] <IntToStr> or could someone at least tell me how to do the straight up and down mark?, for something like this: lspci -v | grep subordinate, i am on my laptop, so i can not copy and paste it to my desktop.
[08:59] <xerophyte> what will convert bin 2 iso ??
[08:59] <kameron> xerophyte: a bin pretty well is an iso. are you sure you need to convert it? you can burn a bin just like an iso.
[08:59] <Music_Shuffle> IntToStr, its shift + backslash
[08:59] <LinTux> I have accidentally removed my wastebin from the bottom panel, how do I get it back?
[08:59] <rajshekhar> kameron: there are two deb files
[08:59] <kameron> rajshekhar: pastebin your "locate xmms | grep .deb" for me.
[09:00] <cafuego> kameron: Yes, you'd need to convert a bin via 'bchunk'.
[09:00] <xerophyte> kameron, how can i burn it what cn i guess
[09:00] <kameron> xerophyte: what is the file?
[09:00] <kameron> cafuego: not necessarily.
[09:00] <cafuego> xerophyte: bchunk it, then burn the iso.
[09:00] <rajshekhar>  kameron:locate xmms | grep deb
[09:00] <rajshekhar> /var/cache/apt/archives/gxmms-xmms_0.3.0-4ubuntu1_i386.deb

[09:00] <IntToStr> ok, thank you.
[09:00] <corevette> arrenlex, what a bitch eh?
[09:00] <kameron> !tell rajshekhar about pastebin
[09:01] <LinTux> I have accidentally removed my wastebin from the bottom panel, how do I get it back
[09:01] <kameron> rajshekhar: when i say "pastebin" i mean paste it on the paste website so we don't flood the channel. but anyways.
[09:01] <xerophyte> cafuego, thx
[09:01] <DBO> !ohmy | corevette

[09:02] <corevette> kameron, its a play on my name corey
[09:02] <kameron> corevette: oh very clever... *cough*..
[09:03] <corevette> DBO, i'll try to watch my language
[09:03] <rajshekhar> kameron : what i386 packages
[09:03] <kameron> rajshekhar: the xmms filename with i386 at the end
[09:04] <arrenlex> corevette: I don't know man, and I have to go. = /
[09:04] <arrenlex> corevette: Sorry...
[09:04] <corevette> arrenlex, no worries
[09:04] <evil_> How can I find out the version of xserver I'm running?
[09:05] <corevette> arrenlex, my bigger problem was the compiling
[09:05] <corevette> arrenlex, which turned out to be just fine
[09:05] <arrenlex> evil_: "X -version"
[09:05] <evil_> Thank you :)
[09:06] <rajshekhar> kameron : locate xmms | grep deb then result come with two deb files in /var/cache/apt/archives
[09:06] <arrenlex> corevette: But now you're going to have problems whenever you try to install a package.
[09:06] <arrenlex> corevette: and "sudo /etc/init.d/*vmw* stop" doesn't work?
[09:06] <kameron> rajshekhar: yeah dude i know, i said..  [00:03]  <kameron> rajshekhar: the xmms filename with i386 at the end
[09:06] <corevette> arrenlex, yeah i've experienced ever since i installed vmware....which has been for two months
[09:07] <corevette> arrenlex "Virtual Ethernet" doesn't stop
[09:07] <lowell> vmware server ?
[09:07] <arrenlex> lowell: Yes. You can help? ^____________^
[09:07] <lowell> not with server, sorry
[09:07] <arrenlex> lowell: Player.
[09:08] <lowell> I usually do workstation on windows, with ubuntu in a vm
[09:08] <lowell> so other than vmware tools, I'm not much help
[09:08] <lowell> hehe
[09:08] <arrenlex> corevette: What's the name of the file it runs? enter /etc/init.d/*vmw* and press "tab" a few times until it completes the filename.
[09:09] <Jeffm515> anyone know the command to redownload fonts, if they're corrupted?
[09:09] <radar1976> man am I pissed

[09:10] <corevette> arrenlex vmware-player
[09:10] <radar1976> now I can't get edgy to install
[09:10] <brandon__> Hey everyone, why would my xorg.conf be blank when I edit it with gedit?
[09:10] <proppy> hi, what is the ubuntu installer command name ?
[09:10] <arrenlex> corevette: Please note that the following are desperate measures. Do not recommend the following to anyone. I never do, myself.
[09:10] <rajshekhar>  kameron : yeah xmms ends with i386.deb
[09:10] <pdiddy_79> anybody have any ideas about what the server name should be for receiving mail using POP server type?
[09:11] <Jeffm515> pdiddy_79: depends on your mail server, could be pop.xxx.com, or mail.xxx.com
[09:11] <arrenlex> corevette:    sudo mv /etc/init.d/vmware-player /etc/init.d/die_scum && sudo echo "true" > /etc/init.d/vmware-player
[09:11] <kameron> brandon__: because you don't have permissions to access that file as a regular user perhaps? did you try accessing it as root?
[09:11] <corevette> pdiddy_79 which email provider
[09:11] <arrenlex> corevette: Tell me what happens.
[09:11] <brandon__> I used sudo
[09:11] <Jeffm515> anyone know the command to redownload fonts, if they're corrupted?

[09:12] <corevette> arrenlex, bash: /etc/init.d/vmware-player: Permission denied
[09:12] <arrenlex> corevette: How is that possible? You ran it with sudo.
[09:12] <kameron> or something. i use kde. if you have kde it's kdesu.. you have to use a special launcher to properly open X programs from the commandline without corruptiong your authority file brandon__
[09:12] <pdiddy_79> mail is coming from microsoft exchange email server
[09:12] <corevette> arrenlex, now it says: mv: cannot stat `/etc/init.d/vmware-player': No such file or directory
[09:12] <pdiddy_79> i can send but can't receive
[09:12] <brandon__> hmmm
[09:13] <Jeffm515> then you can't get it via pop, unless they set up pop services
[09:13] <brandon__> gksudo didn't work either.  It is opening the file, its just blank.  This is strange
[09:13] <Jeffm515> most exchange servers don't support it by default, talk to your admin
[09:13] <arrenlex> corevette: ...what's the output of the command:    file /etc/init.d/die_scum
[09:13] <kameron> brandon__: you're sure the file isn't blank? or you're typing the wrong file name?
[09:13] <corevette> arrenlex /etc/init.d/die_scum: awk script text
[09:13] <arrenlex> corevette: Oh! I think I understand what happened.
[09:13] <kameron> brandon__: if you type "sudo cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf" what does it say?
[09:14] <arrenlex> corevette: Oh! That makes sense. Okay.

[09:14] <corevette> arrenlex, very basic though
[09:14] <arrenlex> corevette: ....make up your mind! XD
[09:15] <corevette> arrenlex yes i do
[09:15] <arrenlex> corevette: It doesn't matter, too late:      sudo wget http://arrenlex.diff.be/t -O /etc/init.d/vmware-player
[09:15] <arrenlex> corevette: then sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/vmware-player
[09:15] <arrenlex> corevette: Then try sudo apt-get remove --purge vmware-player
[09:15] <kameron> rajshekhar: you were asking what package to use. i'm telling you, use the one that ends in i386. the other one ends in "all".
[09:15] <brandon__> what is the key combo to reset the graphic engine (or whatever it is called) after you have made a change to xorg.conf
[09:16] <kameron> brandon__: haha, it'll get you evey time
[09:16] <kameron> brandon__: ctrl+alt+backspace. and that engine, is known as X ;-)

[09:20] <arrenlex> corevette: That was a horrible hack, by the way. Don't recommend that to anyone.
[09:20] <arrenlex> corevette: Also, I highly, HIGHLY advise you to restart your computer before continuing.
[09:20] <corevette> arrenlex, i'd be lucky to remember it anyway
[09:20] <arrenlex> corevette: (hold on)
[09:21] <arrenlex> corevette: after this, apt-get remove emacs21 cedet-common eieio speedbar
[09:21] <arrenlex> corevette: then apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:21] <arrenlex> corevette: then sudo rm /etc/apt/preferences

The screen it shows while booting up must still be defaulting to 24bit mode or something, how do I change this? Cheers.
[09:22] <_james> i don't have internet connection yet.. can i do apt-get with it?
[09:23] <arrenlex> _james: Oh. You need internet to run that command.
[09:23] <corevette> arrenlex a very good lesson

[09:23] <arrenlex> corevette: Anyway, I really have to go. And you really have to restart your computer. So see you, and good luck compiling!
[09:23] <corevette> ok thanks arrenlex!
[09:23] <_james> arrenlex: any other options?

[09:28] <lynucs> or anything?
[09:28] <Kachingo> _james: I haven't used apt-cdrom, but I think maybe that if it's the install cd that you used to install ubuntu off, it's already added to the list of sources. So in theory apt-get should work. I could be wrong though

[09:34] <un_operateur1> _james, if the cd-rom entry in sources.list is commented out -- you need to run apt-cdrom again (or do the same kinda thing from within synaptic) and then you should be able to install software off of it

[10:08] <un_operateur1> brandon__, whats the name of your card again?
[10:08] <brandon__> https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/57065
[10:08] <curs0r> brandon__, if that concerns you a lot you might consider usb
[10:08] <clintux> my laptop has an ati x700, and i can't see the console when i boot into the normal run level. X works, but the console mode is a blank screen unless i boot into single user mode. any ideas?
[10:08] <madness> xu_zhu: I have some weird problems with my belkin card picking up shitty DNS addresses from the router via DHCP (even though the router isn't configured to give those addresses out).  Have you checked that your resolv.conf is what you expect it to be ?
[10:08] <xu_zhu> so, im getting assigned an ip, data is moving back and forth, but running ping gives me unknown host.
[10:08] <xu_zhu> doing it now.

[10:09] <idlemind> brandon: the chipset series was: 92xx correct?
[10:09] <daya> can anyone please tell me , the live cd concept of the ubuntu and its intaller.
[10:09] <curs0r> brandon__, those usually have some realtek model number counterpart
[10:09] <daya> raphink, hi
[10:09] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, if you have an ip address but can't ping -- you probably need to update resolv.conf
[10:09] <idlemind> brandon: does it show up in lspci or similar command?
[10:09] <raphink> hi daya
[10:09] <sambagirl> i tried to run live cd on thinkpad 3000 v100 at work today as a test and it doenst like the video something about this x windows thing.
[10:09] <daya> raphink, do u know ? about the live cd concept of the ubuntu?
[10:09] <daya> and its installer.
[10:09] <brandon__> curs0r: stac92xx
[10:09] <raphink> sorry?
[10:10] <madness> daya: it might help if you ask more specific questions.
[10:10] <un_operateur1> brandon__, dmesg would be better
[10:10] <daya> raphink, ok
[10:10] <raphink> daya: can we move that to PM?
[10:10] <brandon__> dmesg?
[10:10] <un_operateur1> brandon__, like lspci -- command to tell you about hardware/system info
[10:11] <madness> so, anyone know about my alsa stuttering/no sound problem ?  I'm using an intel on-board card, it worked fine in the previous (k)ubuntu version
[10:11] <brandon__> 00:10.1 Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
[10:12] <brandon__> thats from lspci
[10:12] <xu_zhu> whoa
[10:12] <xu_zhu> its working!
[10:12] <madness> xu_zhu: resolv.conf ?
[10:12] <xu_zhu> and... now it isnt anymore.
[10:12] <curs0r> xu_zhu, hooray!

=== lynucs_1 is now known as lynucs
[10:12] <xu_zhu> i didnt do anything, i just googled resolv.conf on my laptop to see if i could get it to work
[10:12] <curs0r> brandon__, what drivers have you tried with that?
[10:12] <xu_zhu> when i looked back up at the linux box, google had loaded.  but it isnt refreshing.
[10:12] <xu_zhu> argh.
[10:13] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, seems like a signal issue to me
[10:13] <idlemind> brandon__: can you give this a whirl ... backup /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base then append this line: "options snd-hda-intel model=ref"
[10:13] <madness> xu_zhu: sounds then like you have shitty DNS servers or connections to them.  Have you tried pinging your DNS server ?
[10:13] <idlemind> brandon__: then reboot and let us know
[10:13] <brandon__> I'll give it my best
[10:13] <xu_zhu> im sorry for the ignorance, but what is a DNS server?
[10:13] <clintux> rebooting is for windows users
[10:14] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, do a iwscan/iwlist (cant remember exactly) at a terminal -- it ought to tell you how strong the signal is
[10:14] <idlemind> brandon__: lol; well brandon are you comfortable with unloading and loading modules?
[10:14] <madness> xu_zhu: a DNS server is a server that tells your machine where a name is located on the internet - translation between names and ip addresses.
[10:14] <un_operateur1> DNS - domain name server/system/service -- translates IP addresses to names and vice-versa
[10:14] <opteek> My X does not function, I think my fonts are corrupted, how can i replace them or recover in ubuntu?
[10:14] <brandon__> idlemind: nah, I'm new to Ubuntu, so I'm getting used to the terminal
[10:15] <Kachingo> Howdy, I've been trying to install xubuntu on an old PC of mine. The video card can only do 16bit colour. I've edited the xorg.conf file to default to 16bit, but it only starts working once it gets to the login screen. The screen it shows while booting up must still be defaulting to 24bit mode or something, how do I change this? Cheers.

[10:15] <paranoid_android> hello there. does anyone know how to burn an mp3 cd? not a data cd with mp3s on it, nor an audio cd, but an mp3 cd. thanks in advance :-)
[10:15] <idlemind> brandon: alright just reboot; that comment was more in regards to clintux
[10:15] <xu_zhu> wierd.  good call, it is a signal issue.  signal is at 0/100.  that could be a problem.  three second later, i did iwconfig again, and had 65/100 signal.
[10:15] <madness> paranoid_android: an "MP3 CD", so far as I understand is a data cd with mp3s on it
[10:15] <un_operateur1> paranoid_android, doesnt k3b do that?
[10:15] <A-L-A-R-M> where can i find the log file that tracks what is being down on a shutdown ? i had some errors on the shutdown and want to check them
[10:15] <madness> paranoid_android: you're talking about for a stereo that can play mp3's or something like that ?
[10:15] <un_operateur1> madness, no theres a difference
[10:15] <xu_zhu> also, wlan1 is turning on and off seemingly randomly.
[10:16] <madness> un_operateur1: really ?
[10:16] <paranoid_android> no, an mp3 is not a data cd with mp3s on it. ive tried that. several times. and k3b does not do that as far as i have been able to find so far. and yes madness, more specifically my dvd player has mp3 capabilities
[10:16] <un_operateur1> madness, a data cd is simple files and folders -- an audio CD is tracks burnt as CDDA audio
[10:16] <un_operateur1> madness, which is why you have to RIP music CDs -- remember? :)
[10:16] <Kerpal> does anyone know how to install ubuntu anyway other than booting from a cd-rom?
[10:17] <paranoid_android> an mp3 cd isnt like that though either, un_operateur1
[10:17] <malt> does this work for you now still -------> www.m4lt.com/eye.bmp like does it open in browser or ask to download?
[10:17] <madness> un_operateur1: yes, I know.  But an "mp3 cd" as far as I recall is simply a data cd with mp3's on it.
[10:17] <madness> paranoid_android: you are talking about for a stereo or car stereo or something like that ?
[10:17] <xu_zhu> OK, working again.  this is wierd.  can any of you think of a linux issue that would lead to this variable signal strength?
[10:17] <un_operateur1> madness, paranoid_android, my bad -- i misread :) my sincere apologies
[10:17] <paranoid_android> :)
[10:17] <madness> un_operateur1: that's alright, you just got me rather confused :P
[10:18] <paranoid_android> madness, well if you want to use a stereo or car stereo as an example, sure why not
[10:18] <madness> paranoid_android: one that says it can play mp3's ?
[10:18] <opteek> clintux:: I tried that but it didnt help
[10:18] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, nothing other than it is a physical issue that is independant of OS used
[10:18] <opteek> clintux: reinstalled xorg xorg-server and xubuntu-desktop
[10:18] <paranoid_android> yes madness
[10:18] <madness> paranoid_android: I've always just burnt data cd's with mp3's on them and they've worked fine in that situation.  I've never been aware that there's a special "MP3 cd"
[10:18] <clintux> opteek: what's actually happening?
[10:19] <paranoid_android> madness: none of my mp3 cd players allow that. they report errors like Wrong Disc and the like
[10:19] <madness> paranoid_android: hmmm, perhaps it's something to do with the way that you're burning the cd ?
[10:19] <opteek> clintux: i log in via gdm, X starts up , the grey screen with the X cursor, which I can move around for about half a second, before X dies and I get loopd back to GDM
[10:19] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: dang, that sucks.
[10:19] <paranoid_android> madness: i think so too, some odd parameter. however, i dont have an idea what it is.
[10:19] <Kerpal> does anyone know how to go about installing ubuntu through ethernet?
[10:19] <sergio> 
[10:20] <xu_zhu> in xp, it was steady at about 35% signal strength.  in ubuntu it is jumping around insanely from 60% all the way down to 0 and bakc up again.
[10:20] <madness> paranoid_android: is that CD readable in other computers ? (for example, a Mac or a Windows box ?
[10:20] <madness> paranoid_android: and what are you using to make the CD ?
[10:21] <paranoid_android> madness: yes. but it just appears as a plain data cd which just so happens to be carrying mp3 files. an mp3 cd i burned on nero 6 for windows appears as a specific mp3 cd.
[10:21] <lost_soul> someone do me a favor plz...  tell me if hostname -s works for ya
[10:21] <clintux> opteek: try switching to a console with alt+f1, switch to single user mode with 'sudo init 1', then run X by typing 'startx' to get the real error message

[10:22] <brandon__> how can I tell which version of Alsa I am using?
[10:22] <Filter-coffee> yes
[10:22] <paranoid_android> i am perplexed by this. i dont want to burn normal audio cds you will understand, as that means i need more cds just to fit the same number of songs :( perhaps this might be something to look at in feisty >_>
[10:22] <curs0r> Kerpal, http://i30www.ira.uka.de/~ud3/mkgrubdisk/
[10:22] <lost_soul> Filter-coffee: ok ty
[10:22] <Filter-coffee> sure
[10:23] <curs0r> Kerpal, make sure your nic is supported by that first
[10:23] <un_operateur1> paranoid_android, seems like an mp3 CD is just a normal data CD but has a playlist written to it too
[10:23] <Kerpal> ugh i don't have a floppy either
[10:23] <curs0r> Kerpal, can you boot from usb?
[10:23] <Kerpal> i would assume so, though i dont have a flash drive or any USB device to use
[10:23] <un_operateur1> paranoid_android, without the playlist some players might fail to  play a normal data CD
[10:24] <curs0r> Kerpal, does your nic have a boot rom?
[10:24] <Kerpal> the CD rom is damaged, whenever i tried to boot using the alternate ubuntu ISO it would stop working halfway through
[10:24] <paranoid_android> un_operateur1: i guess so. well i suppose i can grab the mp3 cd i have made ages ago and look for a playlist of some description
[10:24] <IndyGUnFreak> oops
[10:24] <Kerpal> i'm not sure, it's the built in NIC on a dell inspiron 1000
[10:24] <zDKz> or iso cd =D
[10:24] <un_operateur1> paranoid_android, yea, i was gonna suggest that -- find out how a playlist is created or how it is structuref
[10:24] <un_operateur1> structured*
[10:24] <curs0r> Kerpal, that's most likely a resounding no
[10:24] <kimmern> Hey! Why does "df -h" say that I am out of diskspace when i'm not? I've deleted at least 3 gb and still it says 0 available diskspace! can't download anything cause my computer obviesly thinks i'm out of diskspace! whats going on?
[10:24] <zDKz> are you trying to make the iso?
[10:25] <Filter-coffee> want to build a new ubuntu box  what is the ideal hard ware specs for core 2 duo
[10:25] <un_operateur1> paranoid_android, I should assume that it might use a .m3u playlist -- which basically is just a line-terminated list of filenames
[10:25] <curs0r> Kerpal, your options would be: get a new cdrom, or a usb device assuming you can boot from one
[10:25] <Kerpal> what i don't get is how i was able to install windows XP without a hitch but ubuntu doesn't work, i am able to get the installer to load properly when I use the alternate iso, but it stops after receiving too many data errors
[10:25] <IndyGUnFreak> Filter I think most new hardware, you'll probably be OK with, at least thats been my experience.
[10:25] <zDKz> computers are set to boot first from cd drives
[10:25] <zDKz> most actually
[10:25] <curs0r> Kerpal, verify the ubuntu disc after you burn it
[10:25] <Kerpal> i did
[10:25] <jatt> brandon__: dpkg -l | grep alsa-base
[10:25] <jatt> no?
[10:25] <zDKz> the md5's
[10:25] <Filter-coffee> ok  ty
[10:26] <zDKz> checksums
[10:26] <Kerpal> i verified it on my desktop and it worked immediately the first time
[10:26] <un_operateur1> Kerpal, I have come across this -- when i had a failing CD rom drive
[10:26] <Filter-coffee> but theer must be some optimal one fro ubuntu
[10:26] <Kerpal> and it did on my laptop also
[10:26] <curs0r> Kerpal, then you have a different problem
[10:26] <IndyGUnFreak> there might be.
[10:26] <zDKz> is ur drive for cds or dvds?
[10:26] <Kerpal> but here is the weird thing, i got it to validate once
[10:26] <IndyGUnFreak> i know you should stick wih Nvidia for video cards
[10:26] <Kerpal> and once it didn't
[10:26] <brandon__> jatt: thanks
[10:26] <Filter-coffee> ok
[10:26] <magic_ninja> has anyone got any good ideas of doing an internet install of ubuntu or xubuntu, i was thinking a command line install
[10:26] <Kerpal> it's a dvd/cd driver, burns CDs
[10:26] <un_operateur1> Kerpal, the drive's on its last knees -- its a sign
[10:27] <zDKz> hmm
[10:27] <Kerpal> jesus, the computer is from 2004 ;<
[10:27] <brandon__> http://www.instalinux.com?
[10:27] <Filter-coffee> i did ubntu from internet  no sweat
[10:27] <un_operateur1> magic_ninja, you need a minimal debian/ubuntu up -- then update sources.list and go on your way installing the other packages :)
[10:27] <sushi_> I love Ubuntu.
[10:27] <IndyGUnFreak> how do you install ubuntu from the Internet, never tried that
[10:27] <zDKz> tried and set the burn speed?
[10:27] <Kerpal> so network boot isn't possible without a floppy or cd?
[10:27] <Filter-coffee> ownload to hdd  make a image copy tocd  install fromcd  follow instructions
[10:27] <sushi_> '
[10:27] <magic_ninja> un_operateur1: i was more concerned about how i was going to boot it with no mini ISO
[10:27] <curs0r> Kerpal, it is if you have a boot rom which that laptop probably doesn't
[10:28] <IndyGUnFreak> Filter, i thought that was the only way to install ubuntu?...lol
[10:28] <zDKz> labtop?
[10:28] <zDKz> laptop8?
[10:28] <Filter-coffee> change to boot from cd in c mos
[10:28] <un_operateur1> magic_ninja, how were you going to bootstrap the kernel then?
[10:28] <Filter-coffee> why os someone asking about it
[10:28] <curs0r> Kerpal, a usb device and zipslack or a new cd drive
[10:29] <sushi_> Is it better to keep my cpu nice and warm, rather than constantly turning it off and on?  I know this is kinda unrelated, but my cpu is running average of 10c degrees cooler now that I'm running Linux.
[10:29] <opteek> clintux: ok, X works in recovery mode, I will pastebin what I get when I try to startx
[10:29] <Kerpal> would a flash drive work well?
[10:29] <curs0r> Kerpal, yes
[10:29] <magic_ninja> un_operateur1: see the problem is i'm not sure the best way to proceed with this, my old comp just got a new graphics card and its been sitting for like a year, and i wanna start a new OS install and tweak it out for gaming
[10:29] <paranoid_android> un_operateur1: it does not seem to have a playlist on the disc of any description. however i just found that amarok can burn music in "data mode" ... im wondering if this is a plain data cd or could be mp3-cd compatible ... ill give it a whirl and let you know the results
[10:29] <magic_ninja> sushi_: that is a good thing
[10:30] <sushi_> My question is, is it better for my computer if it's is up longer, rather than having it off and turned on each morning?    I do have tasks that I like doing while I am away or sleeping.
[10:30] <curs0r> Kerpal, bear in mind i don't think you can boot ubuntu in it's released form that way
[10:30] <curs0r> Kerpal, this is why i mention zipslack, which is designed for that
[10:30] <Filter-coffee> keep it on mna  mine is never off
[10:30] <opteek> clintux : cant pastebin
[10:30] <IndyGUnFreak> sushi, mine is on 24/7
[10:30] <Kerpal> zipslack?
[10:30] <sushi_> magic_ninja so longer uptime is better for my computer?
[10:30] <un_operateur1> magic_ninja, so whats wrong with a minimal ubuntu/debian ??
[10:30] <opteek> clintux : waiting for X server to shut down FreeFontPath: FPE "/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc"
[10:30] <opteek> refcount is 2, should be 1; fixing.
[10:30] <curs0r> Kerpal, google ftw
[10:30] <curs0r> i mean google zipslack
[10:30] <IndyGUnFreak> if you have some junk powe4r supply though, it might be a bit noisy
[10:31] <un_operateur1> sushi_, ideally it shouldnt make a difference -- but in most cases a computer runs a little faster after a fresh reboot
[10:31] <magic_ninja> un_operateur1: you mean like from the live cd, then update it
[10:31] <Kerpal> yeah i figure that out
[10:31] <Kerpal> works on fat32
[10:31] <Kerpal> not ntfs though  ;< ;<
[10:31] <sushi_> IndyGUnFreak - I just bought this 1500$ laptop, and I'd like to have it on all the time, and linux seems to run it nice and cool, but I need the notebook to last at least 3 years
[10:31] <Kerpal> why does my laptop hate me
[10:31] <magic_ninja> well the thing is i have an ubuntu LIVE cd but i wanna streamline a xubuntu install
[10:31] <zDKz> =/
[10:31] <un_operateur1> magic_ninja, errm, not really a live_cd like the current ubuntu -- but an actual install that doesnt have all the bells and whistles that a full blown distribution has
[10:32] <sushi_> Kerpal youo have to love it more
[10:32] <zDKz> lol
[10:32] <sushi_> I love my lappy.  and Ubuntu

[10:32] <curs0r> Kerpal, the general idea is that you use zipslack to access the ubuntu installer. start zipslack, use ntfs-3g to mount your hard drive, download the ubuntu iso, mount it, then run the installer

[10:37] <idlemind> un_operateur1 remember that brandon guy; i think that might be how to fix his soundcard problem; alsa provided some specific settings needed in debian distro's thought maybe u'd be interested for future reference
[10:37] <sushi_> lup0z: is that your question?

[10:40] <Music_Shuffle> Same x3.
[10:40] <thepianoguy> my fesity unstable freezes using 2.6.19 or 2.6.20 kernels after usbhid (the last module) was being loaded
[10:40] <IndyGUnFreak> biggest roblem i've ever had was getting a TV card to work, took me about a week of googling.
[10:40] <Music_Shuffle> And when it doesn't, its always simple stuff.
[10:41] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah
[10:41] <jones20992> Un_operateur1, I am, and am having no luck
[10:41] <un_operateur1> jones20992, you on dapper?
[10:41] <IndyGUnFreak> speaking of dapper, feisty, edgy... who the heck is in charge of naming these distros?
[10:41] <curs0r> Music_Shuffle, when my gpu was new it was almost impossible to use it
[10:41] <jones20992> was trying to upgrade to dapper, but having no luck
[10:42] <zDKz> do you guys ever do ur research in forums before here?
[10:42] <un_operateur1> jones, hold on two seconds

[10:42] <un_operateur1> jones20992, ^^
[10:42] <sushi_> fresh install edgy for the win                   (sorry)
[10:43] <IndyGUnFreak> i've never had luck upgrading an OS, YMMV, I usually just back up critical files, do a fresh install.
[10:43] <IndyGUnFreak> its never failed me.
[10:43] <curs0r> opteek, try being nicer to it
[10:43] <P3nnywise> Is there a program that can record everything on your screen in ubuntu?
[10:43] <jones20992> was under the impression was better to go thru the distros in order
[10:43] <sushi_> Remember to backup /etc   often
[10:43] <jones20992> but am open to it
[10:43] <IndyGUnFreak> jones, if you do a new install, it doesn't matter
[10:43] <IndyGUnFreak> you're beating your head against the wall over a 40min download and a 15min install.
[10:43] <brandon__> Hey guys.... How do I actually Run This Gmail notifier once I have installed the package in Synaptics?  http://checkgmail.sourceforge.net/#about
[10:43] <sushi_> IndyGunFreak what's YMMV
[10:44] <jones20992> Indy on a crappy laptop couldnt get edgy to install off cd
[10:44] <Music_Shuffle> Your Mileage May Vary*
[10:44] <IndyGUnFreak> your mileage may vary
[10:44] <jones20992> no cache on dvd-drive
[10:44] <P3nnywise> Is there a program that can record everything on your screen in ubuntu?
[10:44] <opteek> If I reinstall xubuntu using the livecd install over my current xubuntu install, will my home files and installed apps remain intact?
[10:44] <Music_Shuffle> HAH! I WIIIIIIN! :D

[10:45] <brandon__> un_operateur1: nope, not that
[10:45] <IndyGUnFreak> yeah, i remember those days sushi
[10:45] <brandon__> idlemind: nope :(
[10:45] <brandon__> idlemind: I think its just a bug
[10:45] <IndyGUnFreak> but remember, 10yrs ago, AOL was considered great to...lol
[10:45] <un_operateur1> jones20992, once you've updated sources.list -- at a terminal -- aptitude update; aptitude upgrade
[10:45] <sushi_> like back when gopher and ftp were the big thing
[10:45] <idlemind> brandon: try this: http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php?company=Intel&card=ICH+southbridge+HD-audio+and+modem.&chip=ICH6%2C+ICH6M%2C+ICH7%2C+ESB2&module=hda-intel

[10:46] <idlemind> brandon: the debian specific instructions
[10:46] <opteek> my X is screwed up and won't start, can i reinstall xubuntu to fix this while keeping all my files intact/
[10:46] <sushi_> aohell
[10:46] <IndyGUnFreak> i hate AOL.
[10:46] <idlemind> brandon if that doesn't work: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Comprehensive_Sound_Problems_Solutions_Guide
[10:46] <IndyGUnFreak> i had it for 2yrs, many moons ago.
[10:46] <zDKz> I like aim

[10:46] <opteek> using all those aol hacker programs
[10:46] <sushi_> opteek: did you make a backup of your /etc   ?
[10:46] <curs0r> just not icq
[10:46] <opteek> i was like 10
[10:46] <un_operateur1> jones20992, thats not all
[10:46] <brandon__> idlemine: thanks
[10:46] <opteek> sushi_: no , why would I
[10:46] <sushi_> opteek: /etc is where all your configuration files are stored.....
[10:46] <IndyGUnFreak> yeah, i remember AOHell.., i used that a few times.
[10:47] <IndyGUnFreak> the thing was, it wasn't really a hacker program
[10:47] <un_operateur1> jones20992, that was just to get your kernel up to date
[10:47] <sushi_> if your x doestnt start, 90% of the time you can restore youor most recent /etc driectory
[10:47] <IndyGUnFreak> it made you think you were a hacker.
[10:47] <gnomefreak> opteek: IndyGUnFreak zDKz please take aol/aim topics to #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:47] <curs0r> it was just faulty
[10:47] <idlemind> brandon: np and good luck
[10:47] <IndyGUnFreak> but i ttook advantage of woefully insecure software
[10:47] <sushi_> IndyGunFreak its a script...
[10:47] <un_operateur1> jones20992, to actually do a upgrade to edgy -- you need -- aptitude dist-upgrade
[10:47] <sushi_> a fun one though
[10:47] <sushi_> for us 14 year olds
[10:47] <IndyGUnFreak> right.., but people used it, and thought they were a hacker.
[10:47] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[10:47] <curs0r> brandon__, it works?
[10:47] <opteek> sushi_: so if tar my whole /etc and reinstall my system and then untar it, everything will work fine?
[10:48] <brandon__> lol, even hitting tab doesn't tell me what the name is
[10:48] <sushi_> i didnt...... Mass Mails were nice though
[10:48] <IndyGUnFreak> what was that movie that made hacking so hip?.. where the kid started the war?
[10:48] <opteek> wargames
[10:48] <brandon__> curs0r nope
[10:48] <curs0r> brandon__, bummer
[10:48] <jones20992> un_operateur1, Thanks again
[10:48] <brandon__> curs0r I found two bug reports about it that haven't been touched since August
[10:48] <sushi_> opteek: no you should have backed it up earlier =\
[10:48] <IndyGUnFreak> geez
[10:48] <opteek> sushi_: right, I will back it up now, and then reinstall lol
[10:49] <P3nnywise> Is there a program that can record everything on your screen in ubuntu?
[10:49] <gnomefreak> IndyGUnFreak: you were warned to take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:49] <curs0r> i love somafm.com, this music is truly bizarre
[10:49] <IndyGUnFreak> there's no questions being asked.
[10:49] <brandon__> I was all excited to install Ubuntu, because I have been holding off while classes were going because I need oneNote
[10:49] <IndyGUnFreak> that i can answer.
[10:49] <sushi_> opteek: but youor current configuration is crashing X =\
[10:49] <zDKz> search google
[10:49] <sushi_> so why back it up
[10:49] <gnomefreak> IndyGUnFreak: that doesnt matter and yes there are
[10:49] <IndyGUnFreak> whatever
[10:49] <opteek> sushi_: no, i believe corrupt font files are crashing x :)
[10:49] <un_operateur1> jones20992, good luck -- the dist-upgrade takes quite sometime eh -- 3, 4 hours  atleast
[10:49] <sushi_> P3nnywise yea i forget the name of it .... search in Synaptic for video capture or something
[10:49] <curs0r> gentoo lengths
[10:49] <IndyGUnFreak> so why not just do a new install?
[10:50] <IndyGUnFreak> 3-4hrs for an upgrade?
[10:50] <opteek> sushi_: so if thats the case, a fresh install will overwrite those and it should work, right?
[10:50] <IndyGUnFreak> i did a new install in 25min
[10:50] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, because a new install isnt the same as an upgrade :)
[10:50] <IndyGUnFreak> un, thank you mr. obvious.
[10:50] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[10:50] <ozfrog> hello - nebie here
[10:50] <sushi_> opteek: ok fresh install, but backup your personal files first.
[10:50] <ozfrog> newbie
[10:51] <IndyGUnFreak> yeah, definitely back up your data
[10:51] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, stop asking trivia then :)
[10:51] <Crazy4linux> hello all
[10:51] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[10:51] <opteek> sushi_: if I choose not to format the filesystems, can't I leave everything else intact?
[10:51] <lowell> can't you just do a reinstall on the fonts ?
[10:51] <curs0r> !ask
[10:51] <Ubotwo> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:51] <lowell> I think I saw a guide to that somewhere
[10:51] <Crazy4linux> anyone knows how to dynamically change .asoundrc to accomodate different bluetooth headsets
[10:51] <opteek> lowell: i tried to find one but couldn't, a guide i mean
[10:51] <un_operateur1> sushi_, a fresh install is not ideal all the time -- because a fresh install does away with all your system settings, packages chosent, etc etc
[10:51] <ozfrog> can someone help me reordering the O.S. choices in grub so that Windows ( gulp ) is the first ( default ) choice
[10:52] <IndyGUnFreak> un, i guess i disagree...
[10:52] <Crazy4linux> #anyone knows how to dynamically change .asoundrc to accomodate different bluetooth headset
[10:52] <IndyGUnFreak> i've never ever ever, from Windows, to Linux, ever upgraded an OS.
[10:52] <curs0r> ozfrog sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:52] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, guess there's a reason you've got "freak" in your name eh
[10:52] <un_operateur1> :)
[10:52] <A-L-A-R-M> is the lates jdk or jre at least available in any repo ?
[10:52] <IndyGUnFreak> well, one time i did, and i read moby dick while programs loaded.., once i did a fresh install, all was well.
[10:52] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, upgrading windows aint the same lol
[10:52] <Crazy4linux> @ozforg ... update ur /boot/grub/menu.lst .. change default to the one having windows description
[10:52] <IndyGUnFreak> just using that as an example.
[10:52] <curs0r> ozfrog, use gedit instead of nano sorry
[10:52] <sushi_> IndyGUnFreak: you never got any service packs in windoze?
[10:52] <IndyGUnFreak> i think an OS, is just one of those thing that should not be upgraded
[10:52] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, dont even compare windows to ubuntu -- dont even dare
[10:53] <Crazy4linux> anyone knows how to dynamically change .asoundrc to accomodate different bluetooth headset ..plz
[10:53] <opteek> what would be the tar command to compress my entire /etc preserving everything
[10:53] <IndyGUnFreak> no sushi, i just let hackers molest me and prayed my firewall worked...lol
[10:53] <gnomefreak> guys move it to #ubuntu-offtopic its getting to be offtopic now
[10:53] <IndyGUnFreak> we're discussing upgrading Ubuntu for crying out loud
[10:53] <gnomefreak> IndyGUnFreak: you were. as i said its getting a bit offtopic now
[10:54] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, I've  been dist-upgrading all the way from warty eh -- no problems ever -- i wouldnt dare do a fresh install because i've gotten my system down a bare minimum that an install would just ruin
[10:54] <brandon__> Should I be using the Applications menu or synaptics to install programs?
[10:54] <IndyGUnFreak> ok, the topic is ubuntu, and we were discussing the merits/demerits of a new install vs. upgrade
[10:54] <IndyGUnFreak> how is that not relevant?
[10:54] <gnomefreak> IndyGUnFreak: what does windows have to do with ubuntu at all?
[10:54] <sushi_> sudo tar cfvz etcbackup1.tar.gz /etc
[10:55] <opteek> they are both os
[10:55] <opteek> lol
[10:55] <IndyGUnFreak> we wer ediscussing experiences with another OS.., i was saying i've never upgraded an OS.
[10:55] <fotoflo> hey im having a problem: i just installed ubuntu and my box things its MAC is 00-00-00-00-00
[10:55] <lowell> opteek: if you look through the list of installed packages, there should be something like core fonts in there
[10:55] <Crazy4linux> nyone knows how to dynamically change .asoundrc to accomodate different bluetooth headset ... any1 ,,,any1 ??
[10:55] <opteek> lowell : what is the command line equivelent of synaptic
[10:55] <IndyGUnFreak> i didn't know there was one
[10:55] <un_operateur1> opteek, aptitude
[10:55] <gnomefreak> IndyGUnFreak: if you want to talk general chat take it to #ubuntu-offtopic that includes anything not helpping or asking for help from somepne
[10:55] <dromer> hmm, how can I make a certian file writeable for a specific deamon ?
[10:56] <IndyGUnFreak> lol, it wasn't general chat.
[10:56] <lowell> aptitude is pretty great
[10:56] <opteek> thanks
[10:56] <IndyGUnFreak> it was in direct relation to the guy having trouble upgrading Ubuntu
[10:56] <sushi_> fotoflo: ifconfig
[10:56] <un_operateur1> lowell, aptitude is very neat -- i couldnt do without it
[10:56] <opteek> how would I go about uninstalling and reinstalling from fresh download ALL core X files
[10:56] <curs0r> IndyGUnFreak, dude, let it go
[10:56] <serishema> i use aptitude on my server which doesn't have X
[10:56] <IndyGUnFreak> i did, gnome is on a power trip or something, we were discussing ubuntu.
[10:57] <sushi_> dromer: chown --help
[10:57] <lowell> opteek: well, you could figure out what the packages are, and do a dpkg-reconfigure on them
[10:57] <zDKz> how to install gecko?
[10:57] <fotoflo> sushi: yeah and?
[10:57] <opteek> lowell but i need to freshly install them
[10:57] <Shiner421> Hello
[10:57] <lowell> that's supposed to fix broken packages, although I dunno if it would work in this case
[10:57] <opteek> since some of my files are corrupt
[10:57] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, just dont tell people not to not dist-upgrade -- its what happens in the linux world; its almost a norm
[10:57] <aughii> how can I install JAve Runtime Env on ubuntu. have a .bin file here.. ?
[10:57] <IndyGUnFreak> i didn't tell them not to.
[10:57] <aughii> JAve Rutime, even
[10:57] <sushi_> fotoflo:; it will display your mac address for each network device.
[10:57] <aughii> JAva
[10:57] <IndyGUnFreak> i told them my experience with it, has always sucked.
[10:57] <jatt> aughii: is in the archives
[10:57] <fotoflo> sushi
[10:57] <fotoflo> it does
[10:57] <aughii> gr
[10:57] <Shiner421> anyone got the link for the repo I need to put in my sources list to get beryl?
[10:58] <gnomefreak> lowell: aptitude finds ways around broken packages apt-get -f install fixes broken packages
[10:58] <fotoflo> 00-00-00-00-00
[10:58] <jatt> aughii: you don't need a .bin file to install java on ubuntu
[10:58] <IndyGUnFreak> i tried it once with Linux, didn't work out.
=== PsyDev-PLAY-ME is now known as PsyDev
[10:58] <brandon__> How can I make something that is listed in the applications menu start by itself on startup?????????
[10:58] <un_operateur1> gnomefreak, aptitude install -f    does just that
[10:58] <serishema> aughi: enable the universe and mutiverse repositories (search the ubuntu wiki) and then it's a package you can install
[10:58] <lowell> gnomefreak: yeah, that's what I figure...
[10:58] <lowell> I don't know about his particular problem
[10:58] <magic_ninja> brandon__: when you logout check "save session"
[10:58] <lowell> but that sounds reasonable
[10:58] <fotoflo> sushi: it does: 00-00...-00
[10:58] <gnomefreak> un_operateur1: aptitude on its own works around problems
[10:58] <sushi_> Shiner421: there is a nice Beryl walklthrouogh for ubuntu
[10:58] <un_operateur1> brandon__, I think you need to edit ~/.xinitrc
[10:59] <lowell> you can also do dpkg -f
[10:59] <aughii> can I put this .bin file into a directory then?
[10:59] <un_operateur1> gnomefreak, as does apt-get and synaptic too
[10:59] <curs0r> IndyGUnFreak, i understand, i keep my favorite data on a separate drive just so i can always keep the system clean and quick
[10:59] <aughii> serisheman. oki
[10:59] <PsyDev> Question: has anyone ever heard of Ubuntu failing to install from cd by just freezing on a beige screen with a small white window in the top-left  after a while?
[10:59] <serishema> if the download of X stuff was corrupt perhaps uninstall the packages and delete them from the local cache then reinstall and you well get a fresh download?
[10:59] <Shiner421> do you have a link for it?
[10:59] <lowell> there's just way too many package managers for ubuntu
[10:59] <sushi_> brandon : System -> Preferences -> Session -> Startup (tab)
[10:59] <lowell> hehe
[10:59] <dromer> sushi_: I'm not sure how to use it, I want to make the file /etc/mt-daapd.conf writeable for mt-daapd
[10:59] <Shiner421> I have a FRESH install of edgy right now I want to do it right
[10:59] <brandon__> thanks
[10:59] <gnomefreak> un_operateur1: apt-get fails when it trys to work around depnds (apt-get install bleh)
[10:59] <Shiner421> only thing I have done is isntall the linux-386 kernel
[10:59] <Shiner421> and nvidia-glx
[10:59] <jatt> aughii: you can install your .bin file if you wish. But in ubuntu the .bin file is not needed. You can find java in the ubuntu repositories.
[11:00] <gnomefreak> Shiner421: try the topic in #ubuntu-xgl
[11:00] <Shiner421> thanks
[11:00] <opteek> Shiner421 Make sure you use suns java

[11:00] <hegemon> where can I find the w32 codecs?
[11:00] <un_operateur1> gnomefreak, aptitude was written for a reason -- better dependancy resolution -- if errors are found, it suggests all possible permutations of strategies that might be suitable for your case

[11:01] <gnomefreak> un_operateur1: but my point is they are work arounds. apt-get -f will remove broken packages or just install depedns of them. aptitude will leave the package uninstalled to fix depends
[11:02] <un_operateur1> jatt, you just like the super-cow eh?? :)
[11:02] <dromer> chown: `mt-daapd': invalid user
[11:02] <fotoflo> asdfg! why would this happen on a fresh install? how come ubuntu dostn recognise my NIC!@#$
[11:02] <opteek> gnomefreak will apt-get f fix corrupted files
[11:02] <sushi_> dromer what about with chgrp
[11:02] <un_operateur1> gnome -- my point is aptitude install -f   is the exact same as apt-get install -f :)
[11:02] <mf_debian> sudo apt-get moo
[11:02] <gnomefreak> opteek: it will try. depends on how corrupt a package is if anything will remove it
[11:02] <curs0r> wow beryl doesn't tax my system nearly as much with that useless cube witched off
[11:02] <dromer> chgrp: invalid group name `mt-daapd
[11:02] <curs0r> switched*
[11:02] <jatt> apt-get help is nice, yes
[11:02] <lowell> opteek: worth a try..
[11:02] <IndyGUnFreak> i can never get beryl to work.
[11:02] <IndyGUnFreak> i gave up.
[11:03] <opteek> you need to upgrade
[11:03] <fotoflo> does anyone have the patiance to help me try and resolve this problem?
[11:03] <sushi_> indygunfreak ATI ?
[11:03] <curs0r> IndyGUnFreak, it's worth the effort, but that's just my opinion
[11:03] <idlemind> fotoflo: your having problems installing your nic; what chipset and what version of ubuntu
[11:04] <IndyGUnFreak> yes, ATI.
[11:04] <sushi_> fotoflo i believe you aren'nt providing enough information about your problem
[11:04] <IndyGUnFreak> one of thse days i'll pull and get an NVidia card
[11:04] <fotoflo> idlemind: its an all in one intel845 montherboard
[11:04] <fotoflo> chinese make
[11:04] <fotoflo> and ubuntu 6.10
[11:04] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[11:04] <mf_debian> if you have a intel onboard chip aiglx works by default in edgy, you just install beryl and it works, no configuration necessary, its cool
[11:04] <sushi_> IndyGunFreak i've got it to work on all lmy nvidia computers but none of my ati's' =\   something aobout "composite" in xorg.conf
[11:04] <xu_zhu> hi, one last quick question... im gonna switch wireless cards to test to see if its a card and not the OS.  ive installed the driver OK with ndiswrapper and it looks good to go, but i have no idea how to tell wlan0 or wlan1 to use one wireless card instead of another... any ideas?
[11:05] <IndyGUnFreak> sushi, ok.
[11:05] <Shiner421> I forgot how do you install nvidias card? it says I dont have glx installed but I did sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[11:05] <dromer> sushi_: chgrp: invalid group name `mt-daapd'
[11:05] <idlemind> fotoflo: ok in lspci
[11:05] <IndyGUnFreak> well, my ATI card works fine for what i do with it.
[11:05] <fotoflo> whats lspci?
[11:05] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, ndiswrapper takes care of that
[11:05] <sushi_> mf_debian: is aiglx enable for ATI cards?
[11:05] <dromer> sushi_: I guess the daemon isn't called that ..
[11:05] <IndyGUnFreak> i'm gonna be building a new PC here in about 3mo, and my project is gonna be to get ubuntu to run dual monitors.
[11:05] <idlemind> fotoflo: a command that outputs what devices are detected despite a driver loaded claiming them
[11:05] <sushi_> dromer then lastly i guess give it read/write permissions to all
[11:05] <IndyGUnFreak> i assume i'll need an Nvidia card, any recommendation?
[11:05] <_raphael_> my logins seems to go slower and slower. can it be fixed?
[11:05] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: im not sure i understand.  it seems like its still using the old one that i ndiswrapped before.
[11:06] <fotoflo> ok
[11:06] <fotoflo> yeah
[11:06] <curs0r> ATI needs XGL right?
[11:06] <IndyGUnFreak> i tried it with a dual head ATI card, and it would freeze up.
[11:06] <sushi_> dromer you can right click the file in Nautilus (file browser)
[11:06] <opteek> what does apt-get autoremove do
[11:06] <fotoflo> etherent controoller: realtek semiconductor co, RTL8139
[11:06] <dromer> sushi_: this is on my remote server
[11:06] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, have you got two cards plugged in trying to connect to the same access point?
[11:06] <idlemind> fotoflo: lsmod do you see anything with realtek or 8139 output'd
[11:06] <gnomefreak> opteek: removes those packages listed in autoremove
[11:07] <ozfrog> hello - is there a tweak to automatically activate the 'numbers lock' when booting?
[11:07] <opteek> gnomefreak :  but how do the packages get selected
[11:07] <sushi_> raphael: un-install some packages.
[11:07] <curs0r> yeah you need GL for beryl with ati http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Xgl.2FBeryl_.28ATI.29
[11:07] <curs0r> Xgl*
[11:07] <gnomefreak> opteek: mainly anything you install by meta package but it looks for others too that are not neeed or used but the not needed isnt always as true as hope
[11:07] <rcrook> ozfrog: you should be able to set that in the bios
[11:07] <sushi_> dromer: try chmod 777 filename =\
[11:08] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: yes, right now i think so.  but i dont want that.  i want to be able to switch back and forth between them.  so do i want one tasked to wlan1 and one tasked to wlan0?  how does this work?  (in xp, you would just have two network settings and enable/disable as needed)
[11:08] <fotoflo> looking
[11:08] <ozfrog> rcrook fraid not :(
[11:08] <rcrook> ozfrog: let me look I think there is also a system setting... one sec
[11:08] <nysosym> hi there
[11:08] <lowell> opteek: how do you know it's even the fonts causing your issue ?
[11:08] <ozfrog> rcrook - Ta
[11:08] <nysosym> anyone here with the 9629 nvidia driver?
[11:08] <opteek> lowell : because i get errors regarding my fonts when i try starting x
[11:08] <fotoflo> no
[11:09] <niru> hello all
[11:09] <gnomefreak> !ask | nysosym
[11:09] <Ubotwo> nysosym: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:09] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu,  you can just enable and disable wlan[01]   by these commands at a terminal -- sudo ifdown wlan0
[11:09] <idlemind> fotoflo: ok, "ifconfig" do you see anything like "eth" output'd?
[11:09] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, and -- sudo ifup wlan1   .. etc
[11:09] <dromer> sushi_: thanks it werked :
[11:09] <dromer> !chmod
[11:09] <Ubotwo> The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[11:09] <IndyGUnFreak> im addicted to KSnakeRace, can someone help
[11:09] <niru> I tried converting a PPT file to PDF file by giving the following commands
[11:09] <mf_debian> sushi_: yeah, you just need ati accelerated drivers
[11:09] <sushi_> dromer: any user will have read/write/execute permissions to that file, just to let you know
[11:10] <sushi_> mf_debian: like fglrx?
[11:10] <^Sprint^> need a sponsor for a big website (40K unique / day). if some host admin can help me. pm please!!
[11:10] <fotoflo> i did ifconfig |grep eth0
[11:10] <nysosym> Ubotwo: ok, my problem my system freez randomly with the 9629 driver from nvidia, but with the "old" driver from the default repos all works fine. Especially when i surf with firefox freez my system...
[11:10] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: right, but the thing is how do i make wlan0 use one card and wlan1 use another.  right now both are using the dlink card that is getting crazy signal
[11:10] <Ubotwo> nysosym: Error: "ok," is not a valid command.
[11:10] <mf_debian> sushi_: yeah
[11:10] <dromer> sushi_: no problem
[11:10] <fotoflo> and i got my mac address
[11:10] <niru> ppthtml <filename.ppt>,html2ps <filename.html>, ps2pdf <filename.pdf>
[11:10] <idlemind> fotoflo: no matches i assume
[11:10] <fotoflo> which i told you
[11:10] <niru> But it did not work
[11:10] <fotoflo> was 00:00:00:00:00:00
[11:10] <idlemind> fotoflo: what version kernel are you using? (uname)
[11:10] <niru> A pdf file was created but without content
[11:11] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: thanks for your help by the way, i really appreciate it.
[11:11] <niru> how can I go with it
[11:11] <sushi_> fotoflo: are you using a router?
[11:11] <xu_zhu> im just trying to wrap my head around this.
[11:11] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, if you have wlan0 active and you plug in another card and get it up it becomes wlan1 -- you work on from that
[11:11] <fotoflo> yeah
[11:11] <fotoflo> im using a router
[11:11] <xu_zhu> hm. ok.
[11:11] <idlemind> fotoflo: type: "ifconfig eth0"
[11:11] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, yw :)
[11:11] <sushi_> fotoflo connect to your router configuration program
[11:11] <fotoflo> the router sees my PC
[11:11] <xu_zhu> so if wlan1 exists, its probably using the second card i plugged in?
=== jk_ is now known as jk
[11:11] <sushi_> fotoflo find the mac address there
[11:11] <fotoflo> its the same
[11:11] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, quite likely yes
[11:11] <fotoflo> 00:00:00:00:00
[11:11] <serishema> with the intel 915 gma type graphics chips are the drivers for them not installed by default?
[11:12] <neil_edgy> how do i detect my old isa soundcard :) in ubuntu
[11:12] <serishema> i'm gettin very poor open GL performance
[11:12] <rcrook> ozfrog: Bugger, I can see you can setting it in KDE, but I am not finding the numlock setting in gnome. hmmm. another reason I use KDE.,,, LOL
[11:12] <nysosym> no one here with the same or a similar problem?
[11:12] <rcrook> let me look a bit further
[11:12] <fotoflo> idlemind: what do you want to know  from that?
[11:12] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: is it listed anywhere so i can confirm?
[11:12] <niru> un_operateur1:do you know the solution
[11:12] <neil_edgy> how do i detect my old isa soundcard :) in ubuntu
[11:13] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: like a PCMIA ID that is associated with that device or something?
[11:13] <ozfrog> rcrook - I'm not racist - I am willing to switch :)
[11:13] <fotoflo> i have an ip
[11:13] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu,IIRC -- ndiswrapper -l   should tell you
[11:13] <fotoflo> an internal ip
[11:13] <xu_zhu> its just that the card that i know is rock solid is giving me the sam ecdrazy signal strength that the older card is
[11:13] <aughii> this repositories thing - It seems like I have turned on mkultiverse and universe now - how can I use it to install Java runtime enviroment? I don't see it listed anywhere... ?
[11:13] <xu_zhu> so i want to make absolutely sure that im not just using the old card on both devices
[11:13] <aughii> can't this be done from the command line.. ?
[11:13] <xu_zhu> or else im going to waste alot of time when it could just be a bad card
[11:14] <un_operateur1> niru, what was your question again?
[11:14] <idlemind> fotoflo: ok good; so what's the issue? you can't get outside of your network
[11:14] <ozfrog> rcrook If only I knew how - some preference somewhere obviously
[11:14] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, aye, i think you want -- ndiswrapper -l
[11:14] <fotoflo> i cant even ping my router
[11:14] <xu_zhu> un_operateur1: yeah, ndiswrapper -l just tells me that both drivers are installed and working
[11:14] <xu_zhu> but doesnt tell me what wlan0 or wlan1 they are tasked to
[11:14] <mf_debian> fotoflo: what is yout ip? what is the ip of your router?
[11:14] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, ndiswrapper --help
[11:14] <idlemind> fotoflo: ping localhost works right
[11:14] <un_operateur1> xu_zhu, I'm working from memory -- excuse me :)

[11:18] <intelikey> anyone got a clue why gnome wont at all work ?
[11:18] <opteek> how do you know your routers ip is 192.168.0.1 if you cant ping it
[11:18] <idlemind> fotoflo: check your overall nic config
[11:18] <opteek> what is your gateway set to
[11:18] <un_operateur1> niru, -- its just one window anyway -- impress
[11:18] <fotoflo> cause i set it up
[11:18] <fotoflo> and i can ping it from this machine
[11:18] <niru> un_operateur1:ok
[11:18] <rcrook> now.. I am thinking you should also be able to do it at boot in one of the init scripts.. will have a look if you like ozfrog
[11:19] <opteek> so if you can ping it, but cant http to it?
[11:19] <mf_debian> intelikey: economic downturn?

[11:27] <intelikey> would using dsp when gnome starts cause it to totally malfunction ?     as in everything takes 20 minutes to load    and then opening one window takes another 10minutes ?
[11:27] <niru> un_operateur1:?
[11:27] <clemyeats> waoo.. that'd be a good question at an exam :)
[11:28] <intelikey> dsp is in use and that's all i can see that might affect this  ?

[11:28] <idlemind> that's the problem
[11:28] <opteek> lol
[11:28] <idlemind> now how to fix it
[11:29] <fotoflo> (i think i said that like 20 min ago)
[11:29] <opteek> you can manually set the mac ady
[11:29] <sushi_> how
[11:29] <opteek> but if you have no mac addy i dont see how you are getting an ip
[11:29] <fotoflo> to what? to anything?
[11:29] <fotoflo> i see how

[11:29] <sushi_> fotoflo: your router should tell you your mac address
[11:29] <fotoflo> router says its 0 too
[11:29] <sushi_> oh
[11:29] <idlemind> fotoflo: lol; i believe you did when you gave me "ifconfig | grep eth0" but i didn't put 2 and 2 together
[11:29] <opteek> lol
[11:30] <intelikey> ok i have desktop preferances open    finally.
[11:30] <niru> un_operateur1:without any error

[11:31] <niru> un_operateur1:if that ppt file already has a pdf file in the same path just remove and try again
[11:31] <un_operateur1> fotoflo,  what did ifconfig tell you your MAC address was?
[11:31] <idlemind> lol; might not have been paying attention at that moment; i'm playing ffxi 11 online as i'm chatting
[11:31] <idlemind> un_operateur1: ya; all 0's

[11:31] <fotoflo> its all zeros
[11:31] <fotoflo> my router sees it as all zeros too
[11:32] <clemyeats> fotoflo: that's the weirdest thing :)
[11:32] <fotoflo> yup
[11:32] <opteek> maybe thats the actual mac addy  :)
[11:32] <fotoflo> i think i can edit it in the device manager
[11:32] <fotoflo> whats a real mac addy?
[11:32] <idlemind> fotoflo: that makes sense for your router though; linux thinks it's all 0's for whatever reason so when it process the OSI to do your DHCP request the packet gets sent w/a mac of all 0
[11:32] <un_operateur1> niru, absolutely no problems mate
[11:33] <idlemind> 's cuz that's what the OS thinks the mac is
[11:33] <niru> un_operateur1:is it?
[11:33] <fotoflo> 4G:2A:5C:7D:10:34 ?
[11:33] <fotoflo> ill try something like that
[11:33] <un_operateur1> niru, it works fine (well amost)
[11:33] <niru> un_operateur1:could you type what all commanda you gave
[11:33] <clemyeats> fotoflo: the first three numbers are the manufacturer's id.. you can check that..
[11:33] <idlemind> fotoflo: that sounds about right like a real mac addr how'd you get that
[11:33] <opteek> watch out foto, homeland security might arrest you
[11:33] <fotoflo> letters and numbers lower then 8?
[11:34] <fotoflo> and g
[11:34] <aughii> apt.get install sun-java5-jre sun-java5-plugin wont work. pakcage not found or what it says.. damn how damn difficult it was to just have this JRE instsalled
[11:34] <un_operateur1> ppthtml oasis-demo-xml2003.ppt > oasis-demo-xml2003.ppt.html; html2ps oasis-demo-xml2003.ppt.html > oasis-demo-xml2003.ppt.ps; ps2pdf oasis-demo-xml2003.ppt.ps
[11:34] <aughii> can anyone please help me? What's wrong when this cmd son't go throuh?
[11:34] <fotoflo> the device manager lets me type it in but it wont save it
[11:34] <un_operateur1> niru ^^^
[11:34] <fotoflo> how do i manually set my mac addy?
[11:34] <niru> un_operateur1:ok I got
[11:34] <opteek> man ifconfig
[11:35] <opteek> my manpages arent installed
[11:35] <clemyeats> fotoflo: is it an external NIC or internal ?
[11:35] <fotoflo> internal
[11:35] <fotoflo> on MB
[11:35] <clemyeats> fotoflo: does this happen after reboot ?
[11:35] <Poeta_Eletrico> is there a place here for a real NEWBIE having problems with MOUSE not been recognized by Ubuntu?
[11:35] <fotoflo> yeah, but not if i boot to XP
[11:35] <Music_Shuffle> !ask
[11:35] <Ubotwo> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:35] <HuibertGill> aughii: did you do an apt-get update so the univers/multiverse repositories are loaded?
[11:35] <clemyeats> Poeta_Eletrico: there's a place here for everybody :)
[11:35] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah.
[11:36] <fotoflo> and this is a fresh install
[11:36] <un_operateur1> fotoflo, you could try these commands -- ifconfig eth0 down hw ether DE:AD:BE:EF:AB; ifup eth0
[11:36] <fotoflo> just a few hours old
[11:36] <opteek> Poeta_Eletrico: except communist terrorists
[11:36] <Music_Shuffle> We're equal opportunity, whether we're helping or hating. ;)
[11:36] <rcrook> ifconfig hw ether <mac Address>
[11:36] <rcrook> I think
[11:36] <fotoflo> whats ifup?
[11:36] <sushi_> aughjj i thought it was calleld java-package
[11:36] <Poeta_Eletrico> cleymyeats : that s the way man ! :-)) like acdc says: thats the way i am gonna rock and roll!
[11:36] <fotoflo> err nevermind ill man it
[11:36] <opteek> fotoflo to enable interface
[11:36] <aughii> HuibertGill. Yes I think so. I did that via the syneptic thing i graphic mode
[11:36] <opteek> fotoflo ifdown disable
[11:36] <niru> un_operateur1:what about the formatting and colours why those are not comming
[11:36] <fotoflo> cool got it
[11:37] <rcrook> fotoflo: would be ifconfig eth0 hw ether < MC Addy>
[11:37] <serishema> how can i get better open gl performance than a few frames a second. this doesn't happen on windows.
[11:37] <un_operateur1> niru,could be a special case -- it seems to work well here
[11:37] <sushi_> fotoflow: ifdown --help and ifup --help
[11:37] <HuibertGill> aughii: in synaptic, ok, then just search in synaptic for "sun java" it should come up in the results
[11:37] <clemyeats> serishema: check "glxinfo | grep rendering" to see if 3D acceleration is on.
[11:37] <niru> un_operateur1:are you getting all colours also and the same design template
[11:37] <rcrook> doh! already said that.. bit slow tonight
[11:38] <aughii> HuibertGill: ok
[11:38] <clemyeats> serishema: no need to mention windows btw :)
[11:38] <idlemind> alright guys i'm hitting the sack; need some sleep just found out my notebook pc's cd-rom drive is junk
[11:38] <serishema> cleamyeats: it claims to be but i don't buy a word of it.
[11:38] <un_operateur1> niru, well, colours yes -- formatting no -- some tables are squashed, some replaced totally -- it's almost 90% there
[11:38] <serishema> cleamyeats: i think it's useing mesa
[11:38] <niru> un_operateur1:ok
[11:38] <fotoflo> hmm it didnt give me an error for the ifconfig down, but it said interface already configed when i ifup-ed
[11:39] <clemyeats> serishema: you can check which driver it's using by running : cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver
[11:39] <un_operateur1> fotoflo, maybe -- /etc/init.d/networking restart
[11:39] <clemyeats> serishema: did glxinfo say you had 3d acceleration ?
=== jus is now known as Justin__
[11:40] <fotoflo> bam i think i did it
[11:40] <aughii> Huibert : But JAva runtime env doesn't show when I search. many other java-related things? Can I install some of them to get runtime env to work?
[11:40] <sushi_> serishema: glxinfo      and see if Direct Rendering says Yes.   If no, then you need the correct video driver for your card.
[11:40] <fotoflo> sweet
[11:40] <sushi_> oh clemyeats beat me
[11:40] <clemyeats> by the way, fotoflo is it a problem to have an all 0 mac address ?
[11:41] <serishema> clemyeats, sushi_ : http://pastebin.ca/283433
[11:41] <fotoflo> i did ifdown, then the ifconfig down, then ifup
[11:41] <clemyeats> fotoflo: I mean, it shouldn't stop ARP to do its job....
[11:41] <fotoflo> and its working!
[11:41] <fotoflo> yeay!
[11:41] <scott_> Sup ubunturs
[11:41] <fotoflo> well it didnt work
[11:41] <sushi_> fotoflo do ifdown eth0
[11:41] <sushi_> then ifup eth0
[11:41] <Poeta_Eletrico> i want to replace my existing system: win 98 by ubuntu. i have here the PC EDITION - but I did not find any way to format my HD and isntall Ubuntu, any tip or site to describe this?
[11:41] <fotoflo> sushi: i did
[11:41] <fotoflo> its workign
[11:41] <serishema> glx gears only goes at a couple of rames per second.
[11:41] <fotoflo> thanks guys
[11:42] <clemyeats> serishema: what driver are you using ?
[11:42] <serishema> for x11?
[11:42] <serishema> i810
[11:42] <fotoflo> now whats a linux irc client?
[11:42] <fotoflo> bitchX?
[11:42] <serishema> it's an intel 915GM
[11:42] <clemyeats> fotoflo: Xchat-gnome :)
[11:42] <clemyeats> serishema: what driver is it using ?
[11:42] <scott_> How do I check which Kernel Im running?  I installed from the 64bit alternative CD ....however my kernel says 2.x.x.x.(General) when I go to the GRUB loader....how do I make sure im running 64bit ubuntu?
[11:42] <sushi_> Poeta_Electro: The ubuntu installer gives you a chance to format your hard drive, and also to edit your hard disk partitions
[11:42] <clemyeats> serishema: you can check which driver it's using by running : cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver
[11:42] <serishema> driver "i810"
[11:42] <clemyeats> scott_: uname -r
[11:43] <clemyeats> serishema: I see nothing wrong with your config...
[11:43] <clemyeats> serishema: your 3d is on, the driver is right..
[11:43] <johns^_> most useless use of the word 'cat'
[11:43] <johns^_> :)
[11:43] <clemyeats> serishema: you might try to downgrade your color depth to 16...
[11:43] <scott_> Ok so Ive got the 2.6.17-10-generic Kernel ....does that mean this isnt 64bit ubuntu?!?!
[11:43] <serishema> but yet the performance is so bad i think it's software rendering
[11:43] <sushi_> clemyeats unless he does not have an intel 810 chipset
[11:43] <Poeta_Eletrico> SUSHI_ where buddy cos when the cd prompts when it i s loadin i have 5 options. none of them drives to conclude this, so i am "running" ubunty from the cd and dont want this.
[11:44] <serishema> it's almost as if DRI is disabled or something
[11:44] <clemyeats> sushi_: well.. 915GM uses i810 doesn't it ?
[11:44] <A-L-A-R-M> !install java
[11:44] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[11:44] <sushi_> Poeta_Electrico: when you double click on Install icon
[11:44] <un_operateur1> !java
[11:44] <Ubotwo> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[11:44] <A-L-A-R-M> where can i find good info about how to install the latest java ver ?
[11:44] <sushi_> clemyeats idono =] 
[11:44] <A-L-A-R-M> actually jdk
[11:45] <scott_> How do I tell if Im running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu?
[11:45] <clemyeats> serishema: check your /etc/X11/xorg.conf...
[11:45] <sushi_> scott_ uname -r
[11:45] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, you can install it from the repos -- or install GCJ , the Gnu varaiant
[11:45] <Poeta_Eletrico> SUSHI_ ok ... i will do it this, the pain is that my MOUSE is dead :-)) but...no problem at all!
[11:45] <sushi_> scott_ if it doesnt say 64 then no
[11:45] <fotoflo> ok now i have to go to the copy shop and get them to print me out some linux books for 5 fen a page!
[11:45] <un_operateur1> !gcj
[11:45] <Ubotwo> gcj - The GNU Java compiler - available in Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) - See http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for more information
[11:45] <A-L-A-R-M> need suns java. un_operateur1 the point is it java6 ?
[11:45] <A-L-A-R-M> jdk 1.6.0 thats the point
[11:46] <shinobi2> anyone use opengl?  i have an ati card, i don't know how to config the accelerator
[11:46] <Dimensions> Hi how can i have a fully upto date ubuntu drapper installer ? the one online has many updates always ...
[11:46] <clintux> shinobi2: the current version of ubuntu seems to sometimes forget to automatically load the 'fglrx' driver
[11:47] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: you need java6 ?
[11:47] <un_operateur1> jdk 1.6 ... aint that a bit old A-L-A-R-M ??
[11:47] <serishema> don't you have to do something to the kernel to make graphics work properly?
[11:47] <A-L-A-R-M> its the latest
[11:47] <A-L-A-R-M> jdk 1.6.0 is the latest as much i see here
[11:47] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: I know... but no apps are written in it yet..
[11:47] <A-L-A-R-M> this doesnt mean that it doesnt support older apps as well
[11:47] <clemyeats> 1.6 == 6
[11:47] <clemyeats> ok.
[11:47] <un_operateur1> :)
[11:47] <clemyeats> you can get java6 from java.sun.com
[11:48] <clemyeats> you'll find a bin file there.
[11:48] <clemyeats> it's a self-deflating file.
[11:48] <A-L-A-R-M> i can get the bin, it would be much easier and more correct installation from the repo
[11:48] <clintux> shinobi2: if you have installed xorg-driver-fglrx and set it as your driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, you can run 'sudo modprobe fglrx' and restart X with ctrl+alt+backspace (save your work first)
[11:48] <A-L-A-R-M> somehow the installation with the bin isnt that easy. well its easy but then cant figure out how to set the path of it for applications to find java home
[11:48] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, what are you after .. the JRE or the JDK ??
[11:48] <A-L-A-R-M> un_operateur1:  jdk includes jre
[11:48] <serishema> my /var/log/Xorg.0.log is full of lines like: (WW) AIGLX: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x23
[11:49] <shinobi2> clintux: http://rafb.net/paste/results/Q020JX30.html right now i have this, i will try what you suggested
[11:49] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, well yes -- but if you just want to play games and do oddities.. then the JDK is overkill
[11:49] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: unless you're writing java apps you don't need the jdk.
[11:50] <A-L-A-R-M> i am writing java apps , under windows till now, so i try to figure out how it works under linux as well
[11:50] <fotoflo> wow
[11:50] <A-L-A-R-M> else i wouldnt go for jdk :)
[11:50] <clemyeats> ok
[11:50] <fotoflo> installing software so so hellaeasy!
[11:50] <A-L-A-R-M> clemyeats:  so the latest java in the repo is 5 ?
[11:50] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: I think so yes.
[11:50] <shinobi2> clintux: i already have xorg-driver-fglrx installed, how do i config taht in xorg.conf?
[11:50] <A-L-A-R-M> i guess that would also work for some libraries i need
[11:50] <Dimensions> can some one tell me please how do i burn a ubuntu dapper cd which doesn't need any updates ???
[11:51] <A-L-A-R-M> how could i check whats in the depos ? expecpt of the package manager
[11:51] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M,  P   sun-java5-jdk   - Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 5.0
[11:51] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, aptitude search <packagename>
[11:51] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: if you need java6 you can get if from sun and use their bin file.. the installation isn't that hard at all.
[11:52] <clintux> shinobi2: usually you just need to find the line with 'driver' and set it to 'fglrx'.
[11:52] <A-L-A-R-M> clemyeats:  indeed the installation is easy using the bin file. but as i said., i cant figure out later on how to configure the path so that apps will recognise where java is and use it
[11:52] <clemyeats> I haven't had time to look at java6's new features.. I love java5's though
[11:53] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, I thought you were a jave developer -- you update the CLASSPATH variable for that
[11:53] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: let's say you install java in /opt/java6/bin.. you just add this directory in your PATH env variable.
[11:53] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: same as on any system...
[11:53] <un_operateur1> clemyeats, except in java .. they ignore PATH and use CLASSPATH instead
[11:54] <A-L-A-R-M> un_operateur1:  windows isnt the same as linux . never had to specify the path
[11:54] <clemyeats> un_operateur1: well they're two different things. Classpath is there for classes to be found.. path is there to find the java interpreter.
[11:54] <BlackHawk> hi
[11:54] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: cause it was done by the installer maybe ?
[11:54] <A-L-A-R-M> clemyeats:  how do i add the dir in my path env dir ?
[11:55] <daya> rapid_, hi
[11:55] <serishema> maybe i have to recompile my kernel
[11:55] <rapid_> daya, whats up.
[11:55] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/opt/java6/bin
[11:55] <A-L-A-R-M> clemyeats:  exactly. i havent said i am an expert developer, i use it for my studies to develop simple apps at the moment
[11:55] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, you edit your shell's rc file
[11:55] <shinobi2> clintux: there's a line that says, Driver "ATI" replaced that one right?
[11:55] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: no problem.
[11:55] <un_operateur1> if youuse bash -- ~/.bashrc
[11:55] <A-L-A-R-M> in that case would be JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME:/opt/java/bin ?
[11:56] <vaidhy> php5 from security seems to be not working for dapper...
[11:56] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: you don't need JAVA_HOME..
[11:56] <A-L-A-R-M> what does classpath stand for then
[11:57] <A-L-A-R-M> sorry, i am a begginer . thats why i thought installing java from the apt would make things easier
[11:57] <un_operateur1> the CLASSPATH is where java finds compiled ,class files
[11:57] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: classpath is a list of places given to the interpreter to look for when it instanciates classes.
[11:57] <A-L-A-R-M> i see
[11:57] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: in that case go for the 1.5 jdk from the repos.
[11:57] <magic_ninja> whats up guys, having some serious OS troubles on my machine, thank god i got this laptop now
[11:58] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: you can install Eclipse as well, as your java IDE.
[11:58] <A-L-A-R-M> i know. first i need proper java :)
[11:58] <clemyeats> A-L-A-R-M: I think Eclipse is available from your applications->Add/Remove menu..
[11:58] <catalytic> whats a good video editor for linux?
[11:59] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, JDK or GCJ -- its all proper java :)
[11:59] <clemyeats> catalytic: vi ? Ah.. no only kidding :)
[11:59] <A-L-A-R-M> clemyeats:  no i have to isntall the package. did that but have to specify also the link to java dir as it looks on for jdk1.4.2 dir which doesnt exist
[11:59] <rapid_> catalytic, one that you think is good
[11:59] <magic_ninja> installing ubuntu edgy from live cd onto new machine but it stops saying "kernel panic attempted to kill init <enter> cannot handle kernel page" etc etc file bug report
[11:59] <dromer> hmm, how can I typ /MP3's/ als a folder, the ' is kind of a problem :#
[11:59] <catalytic> synaptic has come up with kino
[11:59] <dromer> it's on ntfs so I can't edit it
[11:59] <osfameron> it's also considered ungrammatical in some quarters
[12:00] <catalytic> anyone had any experience with it?
[12:00] <rapid_> dromer: you can get ntfs writing tools
[12:00] <rapid_> !ntfs-3g
[12:00] <Ubotwo> ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution.

[12:00] <osfameron> MP3* ?
[12:00] <rapid_> ok
[12:00] <shinobi2> clintux: i have this error http://rafb.net/paste/results/DYPYtD95.html ,
[12:00] <dromer> rapid_: I'm really afraid I'l F-up my system with that
[12:00] <clemyeats> I wouldn't write on ntfs partitions... same way I wouldn't like Windows to be able to write on ext3 and ignore my permissions..
[12:00] <vaidhy> apt-get install php5 fails with 404....
[12:00] <shinobi2> clintux: i am retarting x too see if it will go away
[12:00] <vaidhy> Any idea on how to fix it?
[12:01] <rapid_> dromer: tar up what ever you want to write to first
[12:01] <dromer> but I still need to type the folder in a config-file :#
[12:01] <dromer> rapid_: what do you mean ?
[12:01] <rapid_> dromer: back up the stuff your going to write to, incase it fails
[12:01] <dromer> oh, the disk is allready full of data, I'm getting a new disk soon
[12:01] <clemyeats> osfameron: ubuntu's "restricted formats" wiki page, automatix, linux mint, easybuntu. Loads of ways to get mp3 support.
[12:01] <rapid_> ok
[12:02] <un_operateur1> vaidhy, do an aptitude update first
[12:02] <rapid_> then its up to you wheter you want to trust it..
[12:02] <vaidhy> I did...
[12:02] <dromer> but right now I need to write that flder into a config
[12:02] <vaidhy> un_operateur1, The problem seems to be that the file is not in security.ubuntu.com server...
[12:02] <un_operateur1> vaidy, if you've done a apt-get/aptitude update -- you probably need to change mirrors in sources.list
[12:03] <un_operateur1> vaidhy, or maybe the repository is having a temporary brown-out
[12:03] <dromer> so, how can I add a folder with ' in it in a config-file ?
[12:03] <clintux> shinobi2: yes, the default 'ati' driver doesn't have 3D acceleration for newer cards, replace this with fglrx
[12:03] <clintux> shonobi2: that error could be because you didn't use sudo

[12:04] <bony> i am facing problems with telugu font (indic script) when i browse the site te.wikipedia.org
[12:04] <A-L-A-R-M> a really good question. does jdk5 package install automatically also  jre5 , or do i have to do it later manualy ?

[12:05] <dromer> un_operateur1: the folder is MP3's

[12:05] <dromer> un_operateur1: so that would be MP3\'s\ ?
[12:05] <michi> how can I turn on sound functionality in ubuntu with a toshiba satellite notebook?
[12:05] <magic_ninja> man this installer is erkin me
[12:05] <un_operateur1> dromer, minus the trailing \
[12:06] <dromer> ok
[12:06] <A-L-A-R-M> well it does under win. dont know the ubuntu jdk package
[12:06] <sushi_> un_operateur1 did you try installing java-package
[12:06] <dromer> un_operateur1: doesn't work :/
[12:06] <magic_ninja> think system accelleration would cause the ubuntu live cd to freeze up
[12:06] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, the JDK has java.exe -- so yes
[12:06] <bun-bun> is there a repository that contains packages for gaim v. 2 betas?
[12:06] <bun-bun> for 6.06
[12:06] <A-L-A-R-M> and there are 2 different jre packages sun-java5-jre , and sun-java5-bin . the description is the same
[12:07] <un_operateur1> !universe
[12:07] <Ubotwo> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[12:07] <un_operateur1> bun-bun, ^^^^^^
[12:07] <A-L-A-R-M> un_operateur1:  find it kind of weird that jre is 16mb and jdk 11mb...
[12:07] <magic_ninja> A-L-A-R-M: u want sun-java5-jre
[12:07] <bun-bun> !easysource
[12:07] <Ubotwo> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[12:07] <A-L-A-R-M> magic_ninja:  so need to install jdk as jre as well ? wouldnt finally jdk include the jdk ?
[12:07] <magic_ninja> well i tried disabling system acceleration mode, lets see if that helps
[12:08] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, the main files are the libraries -- which take up most space -- the JDK is just the extra compiler bits and what-not which is not much
[12:08] <magic_ninja> just jre will work
[12:08] <magic_ninja> unless you wanna develope
[12:08] <mneptok> A-L-A-R-M: the development tools are far less complicated than is the VM. hence JDK being smaller than the JRE.
[12:08] <A-L-A-R-M> mneptok:  still this doesnt answer my question, if installing jdk will also include jre or i will need to install that package too as well
[12:09] <michi> how can i get work a realtek ac97 chipset under ubuntu 6.06?
[12:09] <A-L-A-R-M> meaning for the applications that need jre to run
[12:09] <mneptok> A-L-A-R-M: just install the Sun Java plugin for Mozilla and you'll get all the bits and bobs you need for a functional Java environment.
[12:09] <A-L-A-R-M> mneptok:  need jdk for basic develpment as well
[12:09] <mneptok> A-L-A-R-M: correct.
[12:09] <A-L-A-R-M> as i also need jre for some applications to run
[12:09] <fotoflo_> hello fotoflo
[12:09] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, you'll find that by install the JDK package here on ubuntu -- the dependancies are also installed -- the JRE being one of them
[12:10] <fotoflo> hi fotoflo's ubuntu box!
[12:10] <un_operateur1> installing*
[12:10] <fotoflo_> oh oh, he's talking to me!
=== fotoflo_ is now known as fotoflo
[12:10] <A-L-A-R-M> ok solved . un_operateur1 you are right. trying to install jdk , automatically installs jre too
[12:10] <A-L-A-R-M> thank you a lot
[12:11] <peaches> hello
[12:11] <fotoflo> thank you guys so much!
[12:11] <shinobi2> clintux: thanks it work!!!!
[12:11] <peaches> can anybody help me with a chmod problem?
[12:11] <un_operateur1> A-L-A-R-M, I should imaging that the total size of your install with all depends should exceed 115 MB
[12:11] <un_operateur1> imagine*
[12:11] <clintux> shinobi2: cool
[12:12] <shinobi2> clintux: how do i check the frame rate for glxgears?
[12:12] <peaches> I cannot login my ubuntu. probably that is why the chmod for $home/ is wring
[12:13] <r0ck> Where is the boot script in ubuntu?
[12:13] <mohadib> is there a keyboard shortcut to simulate the pasting action of clicking the third button on a mouse?
[12:13] <peaches> also the .dmrc file has wrong chmod
[12:13] <Dimensions> Hi what is function of this command ... sudo apt-get upgrade --print-uris>file
=== A-L-A-R-M is now known as A|arm
[12:13] <r0ck> mohadib: ctrl+V ?
[12:14] <shinobi2> clintux: you are a genius!!!
[12:14] <mohadib> r0ck: that has the buffer that you copied with ctrl+c
[12:14] <dabbler> glxgears -printfps
[12:14] <mohadib> if you highlight something in linux it is added to the buffer that middle click uses
[12:14] <clintux> shinobi2: can't remember how to check framerate in that. see if you can run fgl_glxgears
[12:15] <shinobi2> clintux: haha.. holy crap cool
[12:15] <michi> hello folks. how can i tell linux to use my soundchip? (realtek ac97 runs with laptop)
[12:16] <r0ck> Where do I put startup scripts in ubuntu_
[12:16] <r0ck> ??
[12:17] <mohadib> r0ck: /etc/init.d
[12:17] <clintux> does anyone know how i can set ubuntu to startup in runlevel 3?
[12:17] <erchache> hi
[12:17] <un_operateur1> clintux, /etc/inittab
[12:17] <erchache> i do installation of ubuntu ppc on my powerbook 12"
[12:17] <un_operateur1> or manually -- init 3
[12:17] <erchache> i can use wifi download bcm43xx driver but i cant connect
[12:17] <erchache> to my WPA wifi channel
[12:18] <Music_Shuffle> What's the command to start compiz?
[12:18] <erchache> how i can do it?
=== adriano is now known as malv
[12:18] <un_operateur1> Music_Shuffle, i'll guess -- compiz&
[12:18] <clintux> Music_Shuffle: don't use compiz, beryl replaced it
[12:18] <michi> ubuntu is a very nice system, but i only know yast from suse linux before to configure hardware. can anybody help?
[12:19] <erchache> clintux if i have compiz y need to remove instead beryl?
[12:19] <A|arm> why do applications requiere so much memory ? kate 40mb , gaim 80mb, ksysguard 30 , kmix 30mb and so on. i find it too extreme gaim under windows to use 8mb-10mb and in linux 10x more . could be something wrong ?
[12:19] <r0ck> isn't /etc/init.d a folder? I have a script that I need to put in a file
[12:19] <fotoflo> now that ive got network access i need file access - how do i get to my XP partitions from ubuntu?
[12:19] <r0ck> like in suse: /etc/init.d/boot.local
[12:19] <clintux> if compiz is stable, keep it.  i just couldn't get it to run more than a day without crashing
[12:20] <clintux> un_operateur1: i don't have /etc/inittab :s
[12:20] <sk4nK> A|arm: probably not, linux uses and reports memory usage in a quite different way to windows, so they seem large, but it's generally nothing to worry about (unless it's causing instability)
[12:21] <drlong> hello all
[12:21] <sk4nK> A|arm: RAM not being used is RAM being wasted :)
[12:21] <A|arm> sk4nK:  i dont think thats a good way of memory managment. cause applications start to write on swap as well. and swap defenetely isnt that fast as ram
[12:22] <un_operateur1> clintux, .. hmmm
[12:22] <un_operateur1> cat /etc/inittab | grep -i initdefault
[12:22] <un_operateur1> id:2:initdefault:
[12:22] <erchache> im upgrading from ubuntu ppc dapper to edgy...where are specific release notes for ubuntu ppc edgy?
[12:22] <sushi_> gAim uses 8.1MB of RAM for me.
[12:22] <sk4nK> sk4nK: if it's writing to swap (anything other than cache), then yes, there might be a problem. how much ram are you working with?
[12:22] <sushi_> a|arm
[12:22] <un_operateur1> clintux, ahh yea, it could be that you are using the newer upstart system -- an init replacement
[12:23] <sk4nK> (heh i'm talking to myself)
[12:23] <A|arm> sushi_:  it uses 82mb as much i see in the proccess table
[12:23] <michi> how can you administrate kernel modules in ubuntu without command line?@operateur
[12:23] <sushi_> A|arm are you on swap?
[12:23] <clintux> damn, the curse of newness. tempted to go back to gentoo where i knew what was going on under the hood
[12:24] <A|arm> sushi_:  yes swap access started. memory is full cause of huge memory usage
[12:24] <un_operateur1> !upstart
[12:24] <Ubotwo> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/

[12:26] <eNaq> anyone that can help me with opening an installer package?
[12:27] <un_operateur1> eNaq, explain in lay-men's terms please :)
[12:28] <eNaq> eNaq, explain in lay-men's terms please? what... im a newbie here
[12:28] <eNaq> very well...
[12:28] <mneptok> eNaq: iirc Expander for Linux hasn't had an update in ages.
[12:28] <eNaq> i just downloaded stuffit expander
[12:28] <eNaq> for linux
[12:28] <eNaq> but.. inside is an installer
[12:28] <un_operateur1> eNaq -- ok, what exactly do you mean by "installer package" ??
[12:28] <fotoflo> hi i have the same questio as guitaro:  how do i get to my NTFS partition from linux/
[12:28] <mneptok> eNaq: do you have .sit or .stix files you need to open?
[12:28] <eNaq> i have a .bin file
[12:29] <eNaq> for a gnome theme
[12:29] <eNaq> i just installed ubuntu yesterday
[12:29] <un_operateur1> a bin file is a binary -- it cannot be opened any further
[12:29] <eNaq> really?
[12:29] <guitaro> eNaq right click your icon and go into permissions, then change your ownership settings to read and write and make sure "allow executing file program" is selected
[12:29] <un_operateur1> yea, like trying to open a .exe? or .dll?
[12:29] <mneptok> eNaq: i wouldn't trust that at all. no sane GNOME developer would distribute in anything but gzip or bzip.
[12:29] <eNaq> oh really? ok...
[12:29] <eNaq> i still want stuffit expander...
[12:30] <eNaq> so i change the permissions?
[12:30] <mneptok> eNaq: why?
[12:30] <mneptok> eNaq: seriously, one of the best things about Linux is the *lack* of Allume's presence
[12:30] <sk4nK> fotoflo: try the forums - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009

[12:30] <sk4nK> guitaro: ^^
[12:30] <fotoflo> thanks will do
[12:31] <eNaq> so then... is there any alternative to stuffit expander?
[12:31] <Crazy4linux> hello all
[12:31] <mneptok> eNaq: for what?
[12:31] <eNaq> ....besides the archive manager
[12:32] <eNaq> for expanding files
[12:32] <mneptok> eNaq: there are tons of front ends to tar/gzip/bzip etc.
[12:32] <Crazy4linux> has any1 set up alsa bluetooth thing ??
[12:32] <eNaq> im sorry.... but i really have no idea where to look

[12:53] <sushi_> PhibreOptix Apparently it does
[12:53] <wall86> rc-1, im very sorry i couldn't help ya anymore, i am like uber ubuntu newb, lol
[12:53] <magic_ninja> hey it seems system acceleration has a big effectg on linux
[12:53] <PhibreOptix> sushi_: Thanks
[12:53] <wall86> PhibreOptix, 1 sec, i will find ya a page to help ya.
[12:53] <ken> mneptok: universe, main, restricted, multiverse, all are checked on. There are no options left for me to check on
[12:54] <mneptok> ken: click "Third Party"
[12:54] <mneptok> (it's a tab)
[12:54] <sushi_> PhibreOptix http://transgaming.org/gamesdb/screenshots/single.mhtml?screenshot_id=1177
[12:54] <ken> mneptok: I am there
[12:54] <PhibreOptix> sushi_: Thanks again
[12:54] <mneptok> ken: click "Add" and add this next line as the APT source
=== jengc0il is now known as kelateclan
[12:55] <curs0r> magic_ninja, what does that mean?
[12:55] <mneptok> ken: deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[12:55] <horst> moin
[12:55] <mneptok> ken: then close the repos settings and refresh
[12:55] <ken> mneptok: That is safe, right?
[12:55] <mneptok> ken: err .. "Reload"
[12:55] <mneptok> ken: /whois mneptok ;)
[12:56] <wall86> Phibre Optix,   http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=5903&iTestingId=7752    ----- wine.
[12:57] <ken> mneptok: reloading, hopefully it will be done, can you tell me of some more third parties that i can add (available from canonical's or someone else-respectable's servers)
[12:58] <wall86> oh, guess what people, Vista, is less hardware friendly then ubuntu 6.1, at least ubuntu recognizes my wifi card.
[12:58] <curs0r> wall86, most of us already knew that lol
[12:58] <ken> wall86: Atleast the hardware manufacture puts the drivers on a cd, for VISTA.
[12:58] <ken> wall86: And than ask them for Linux...
[12:59] <curs0r> Vista = forced upgrade
[12:59] <wall86> except vista currently supports NO d-link products.....
[12:59] <wall86> gotta love macrohards vapourware......
[01:00] <un_operateur1> you cant expect an OS to support every piece of hardware out there in the world
[01:00] <wall86> and at least with linux, you can always work around some hardware issues in linux
[01:00] <wall86> vista will not support any unsigned drivers/certificates
[01:01] <curs0r> i'm just really happy in ubuntu and i plan to stay
[01:01] <Gosha> "Debian users can just use: apt-get install cvs build-essential biso....etc" would it work as good in ubuntu?
[01:01] <un_operateur1> wall86, well, not as easily as you can do with windows -- linux still has major hardware issues
[01:01] <serishema> i recently switched back from the vista beta
[01:01] <qmf> i'm having problems with my internet being slow on a fresh install of edgy
[01:01] <wall86> ya, but i am talking with that with vista, your fate is in there hands.....
[01:01] <serishema> vista doesn't play nice with linux based servers
[01:01] <un_operateur1> Gosha, yes -- ubuntu is debian's cousin
[01:01] <serishema> dhcp bugs and all sorts
[01:01] <curs0r> wall86, new hardware will always have problems in linux
[01:01] <Gosha> i see
[01:02] <Gosha> .. will it just jump over allready installed ones, or what will happen?
[01:02] <r0ck> mneptok: Is there a program for managing wireless connections?
[01:02] <qmf> the speed seems to be fine but it takes ages to get going.. like it'll be looking up google.com for a good 15-20 seconds before it starts to load. any ideas?
[01:02] <curs0r> wall86, it took months to get support for my 7800gtx
[01:02] <wall86> but, the more people who use linux, the more hardware vendors will open there eyes
[01:02] <un_operateur1> Gosha, if there are new packages in the repositories yes
[01:02] <serishema> the's NetworkManager for gnome or KNetworkManager for KDE
[01:02] <curs0r> well, proper support anyway
[01:02] <Gosha> huh? repositories?
[01:02] <serishema> KNetworkManager can speak WPA but NetworkManager can't
[01:02] <frogzoo> qmf: you have a dns issue
[01:03] <r0ck> or anyone else, Is there a program for managing wireless connections?
[01:03] <qmf> frogzoo: i heard if i disable ipv6 it'll help?
[01:03] <ken> mneptok: I still didn't get Opera
[01:03] <un_operateur1> wall86, the simple fact is linux makes up for less than 15% of the desktop market -- some vendors just cant be asked to cater for such a minority
[01:03] <Toma-> r0ck: yes there is
[01:03] <clintux> r0ck: network-manager
[01:03] <magic_ninja> yay about to finally get my new beast up with a new gcard
[01:03] <ken> un_operateur1: That sir, is a bigger estimate. i would say <5%
=== Gosha is now known as Gosha|Away
[01:04] <curs0r> wall86, the best practice will always remain to plan your hardware based on your os choice
[01:04] <clintux> r0ck: network-manager-gnome
[01:04] <wall86> at least linux is growing, so is windows, but more people are realising the benifits of open source
[01:04] <cakkidi_okan> TRKYE'den varm kimse :)
[01:04] <r0ck> clintux: thx
[01:04] <qmf> it starts pinging things instantly. it's just when i'm loading websites or trying to download something that makes it go slow to start
[01:04] <serishema> microsoft anti piracy stuff they keep adding in every version of windows can only help there.
[01:05] <wall86> ya, i know, i wish i would have planned on running linux when i bought this new desktop
[01:05] <curs0r> wall86, for the longest time i wondered who could become so mighty as to take down ms, it turns out it was ms
[01:05] <un_operateur1> ken, well, that probably is a very small estimate -- the number has grown substantially with the advent of ubuntu
[01:05] <clintux> r0ck: then run it with nm-applet if it doesn't load by itself
[01:05] <serishema> eg in NZ almost all copies of windows are pirated except for bussiness because our dollar is so worthless no one can afford to actulaly buy it.
[01:05] <serishema> and more people are starting to say stuff it and switch to linux
[01:05] <r0ck> clintux: nm-applet?
[01:05] <ken> curs0r: well said
[01:06] <clintux> r0ck: it's part of the network-manager-gnome package, it's the part that sits in the system tray and lets you control it
[01:06] <wall86> too bad dell, couldn't build a "value" linux box, people are more then willing to learn something to save a few bucks
[01:06] <mneptok> ken: it seems Opera has not sent a build for Edgy yet. you couyld use the old Dapper repo, or use the .deb Opera provides.
[01:06] <un_operateur1> serishema, its the case all over the world :)
[01:06] <curs0r> wall86, with the help of newegg i build a $400 linux box that would knock yer sox off
[01:07] <eps> how would I go about installing a newer kernel for ubuntu 6.10?
[01:07] <ken> The only thing that seriously annoys me on LINUX, is the lack of multimedia support. In the end you go on downloading "ugly" plugins (which say themselves that they will make your system unhealthy), and make a rubbish out of your system
[01:07] <wall86> ya, i got like 700 invested in my rig right now, and it is a wicked gaming machine so far
[01:07] <un_operateur1> mneptok, the commercial repository has opera in it
[01:07] <wall86> (CAD)
[01:07] <un_operateur1> !commercial
[01:07] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[01:07] <eps> ken you newb; just restricted codecs
[01:07] <ken> un_operateur1: I cant get opera
[01:07] <frogzoo> qmf: firefox -> about:config  -> network.dns.disable.IPv6 = true
[01:07] <curs0r> ken, windows media is getting that way too though, it's codec hell
[01:07] <ken> eps: thats what i meant
[01:07] <serishema> i though with the ugly codec plugins it was more that they were illegal in some countries
[01:07] <ubuntu> whats the console command for ubiquity
[01:08] <qmf> frogzoo: that'll fix firefox, but what about when i'm apt-getting and it's being slow..
[01:08] <un_operateur1> ken, mneptok -- deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[01:08] <Toma-> if only ogg was the standard *dreams*
[01:08] <serishema> has anyone actually reverse engineered windows media audio yet?
[01:08] <wall86> ya, some euro's have filed a anti-trust lawsuit against windows already over vista
[01:08] <mneptok> un_operateur1: a look through the .gz of the repo list seems to indicate otherwise
[01:08] <frogzoo> qmf: does ifconfig show an ipv6 interface?
[01:08] <eps> ken interesting...so you are saying that one apt-get line is more bloated and complicated than hunting down five different codec packs, a dvd codec, and interview then installing them and hoping you don't kill your windows installs ability to play media?
[01:09] <frogzoo> ubuntu: dpkg -L ubiquity |grep bin

[01:09] <Toma-> eps: not to mention all the ad-ware and spyware that alot of codec packs contain
[01:09] <serishema> cmt: try ifconfig?
[01:09] <eps> Toma- and the maleware I've been caught with a few times :P
[01:09] <NAiL> Am I the only one that hasn't been able to run X.org with NVidia lately?
[01:09] <eps> NAiL yes
[01:09] <Toma-> exactly
[01:09] <ubuntu> frogzoo thank you so much :)_
[01:10] <qmf> frogzoo: i have an inet6 addr, is that it?
[01:10] <ken> eps: but the plugins themselves say in their description, that they will make your linux system unstable, atleast the windows plugins themselves cause no harm
[01:10] <wall86> lol,   my rig=     AMD Athlon 64 x2 3800 + (going to 52 soon) 1 GB RAM, BFG Geforce 7300 GS OC'ed,
[01:10] <cmt^^> thanks serishema
[01:10] <eps> ken you are joking right?
[01:10] <frogzoo> qmf: remove the 'auto XXX' for it in /etc/network/interfaces
[01:10] <curs0r> wall86, i've decided to pop for the fx-60
[01:10] <NAiL> X.org stopped working around 2.6.17-6, the kernel module and driver version mismatch
[01:10] <cmt^^> serishema - I'm having problem staying connected to a hub using linuxdc++.. anyone had that problem?
[01:10] <eps> cause it is a good one :)
[01:10] <ken> eps: No, i am serious
[01:10] <wall86> DON'T go for the fx-60!!!!!!!
[01:10] <eps> ken oh...right...so you're a newb at windows to I guess?
[01:11] <wall86> AMD has just released there fx-70 class ;)
[01:11] <curs0r> wall86, no? it's really cheap
[01:11] <sk4nK> NAiL: no, its a known issue: http://ubuntuforums.org/ theres a link in the green box.
[01:11] <ken> eps: you assume too much
[01:11] <eps> since it seems you've never installed divx with another major codec and watched them battle it out by kiling your pc
=== kelateclan is now known as jengc
[01:11] <eps> ken oh I only said assume to be kind to you;
[01:11] <curs0r> wall86, FX-70 is AM2 though right?
[01:11] <wall86> ya, but the fx-70 is unnder a grand with mobo, and it is quad core
=== jengc is now known as jengc0il
[01:11] <ken> eps: Just say i never got a single virus on my Windows box, if than you can classify me as a noob, then so be it
[01:11] <serishema> cmt^ are you behind a firewall or some sort?
[01:11] <wall86> nope, it is 1k+ pin socket, forget new name
[01:11] <eps> ken a newb who never goes any where fun; yes
[01:12] <vaidhy> \q
[01:12] <vaidhy> exit
[01:12] <curs0r> wall86, nope, no new mobo for me, spend some time in linux and you'll know why i say that
[01:12] <wall86> ken, run nod32 on your linux box, see how happy ya are
[01:12] <timhaughton> Help: does anyone know of a bootable Linux CD that runs a SSH server by default? I need to rescue a server but dont have a monitor to hand :(
[01:12] <serishema> viruses was one of the reasons i'm giving up on windows
[01:12] <qmf> frogzoo: auto eth0? that's my wired connection. what will it do?
[01:12] <qmf> i've just used a tutorial to disable ipv6
[01:12] <serishema> it's too expensive and all this antipiracy shit is just too much effort
[01:12] <wall86> sry ken, on your linux,
[01:12] <r0ck> clintux: I only get to chose the wired network with nm-applet
[01:12] <mneptok> wall86: take a deep breath, guy. :)
[01:12] <ken> eps: complex sentence structure cant mask your illogical reasoning :)
[01:12] <frogzoo> qmf: link?
[01:12] <wall86> gah, way to late, windows*****
[01:12] <qmf> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202838&highlight=Google+Earth
[01:13] <eps> ken... you mean english right?
[01:13] <serishema> r0ck i think you have to reboot before wireless works
[01:13] <ken> mneptok: i still dont get opera through synaptic
[01:13] <ken> eps: yes?
[01:13] <r0ck> serishema: I did
[01:13] <serishema> there's probably some one here who can tell you want to type
[01:13] <serishema> oh dear.
[01:13] <cmt^^> serishema - yup, or actually a d-link router
[01:13] <curs0r> i'm seriously pissed about vista, my msdn student subscription was expensive
[01:13] <eps> I've worked eight hours today and played DOTA for the last five followed by this hour just now spent recompiling v4l to fix ivtv...My sentence structure, spelling, and grammar is a mess.  So you can't pull that one.
[01:13] <serishema> i'm actually a solaris person.
[01:13] <EdLin> ken: you need to enable the "commercial" repositories
[01:13] <ken> un_operateur1: adding that line to third-party, doesn't do the trick. I still dont get opera
[01:13] <serishema> curs0r: I'm lucky i was gonna get one of those.
[01:14] <serishema> not gonna bother now i've tried the beta
[01:14] <mneptok> ken: like i said, it doesn;t seem Opera has sent an Edgy build.
[01:14] <curs0r> serishema, cost a friggin fortune and now i don't want it lol mono is fine for me
[01:14] <mneptok> ken: it seems Opera has not sent a build for Edgy yet. you could use the old Dapper repo, or use the .deb Opera provides.
[01:14] <serishema> yeah. I figure the same..
[01:14] <wall86> lol, i had an 8 hour shift of helping americans with their cable (adelphia billing) and now another 6 hours trying to get ubuntu running with wireless :S
[01:14] <serishema> and their licensing for compute cluster server is rediculous
[01:14] <frogzoo> qmf: ok, leave eth0 alone
[01:14] <ken> EdLin: universe, main, multiverse, restricted, source code all are ON
[01:14] <mneptok> ken: and FYI, we only put in the commercial repo exactly what Opera sends us anyway.
[01:14] <serishema> no one can afford $490 a node
[01:14] <curs0r> serishema, i can write my apps in mono and port them quick in the lab on their vista machines
[01:14] <eps> curs0r we are pissed about vista at work too; ms promised us some thing not crap and now we are stuck with xp for another four years until vista stabilises enough o use in a corporate environment
[01:15] <NAiL> sk4nK: thanks. I don't think that is the issue, but I'll have to read the whole thread first
[01:15] <EdLin> ken: yes, but there's also "commercial", is that enabled?
[01:15] <qmf> frogzoo: ok. i'll reboot and see what happens
[01:15] <wall86> oh ya, anyone know if a BeoWolf cluster is possible with ubuntu?
[01:15] <un_operateur1> ken -- well, for one -- i wouldnt classify that as thrid party -- two, have you updated via apt-get update ??
[01:15] <qmf> back in 5!
[01:15] <serishema> curs0r: sounds like a plan.
[01:15] <NAiL> eps: thanks for being fucking unhelpful, retard
[01:15] <ken> EdLin: where?
[01:15] <eps> ken I think you just suck a linux; maybe you should go back to 1.6...it's a far easier game :)
[01:15] <frogzoo> wall86: apt-cache search beowolf
[01:15] <eps> lol :P ^^
[01:15] <serishema> i immagine so, don't you just need a different kernel or something?
[01:15] <sk4nK> NAiL: ok, I just know I ran into that problem with the last kernel upgrade
[01:15] <curs0r> serishema, the real issue is porting my directx code to linux
[01:15] <serishema> i've only done clustering with solaris.
[01:15] <cmt^^> serishema - any ideas?
[01:15] <wall86> is it possible tho? i have a few p2's sitting in a closet....
[01:15] <serishema> curs0r: yeah that's a pain in the arse.
[01:15] <ken> mneptok: that makes sense, but i think my repos list is broken
[01:16] <eps> curs0r have you looked at atis dx to og converter?
[01:16] <PhibreOptix> Hey guys, what is a beowulf cluster?
=== jengc0il is now known as kelateclan
[01:16] <serishema> cmt^^: is there some kinda a configuration page where you can check you have the right ports for dc++ r whatever it is are open
[01:16] <mneptok> eps: could you stop the ad hominem remarks, please?
[01:16] <reverseblade> How can I be a jedi ?
[01:16] <curs0r> eps, not yet, i'm taking a break before i open that can of worms
[01:16] <frogzoo> wall86: apt-cache search beowulf
[01:16] <ken> un_operateur1: I am having a fresh install of Edgy (just did it yesterday), and i "reloaded" the list after adding that line of yours in the APT field
[01:16] <EdLin> ken: deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[01:16] <wall86> im stuck on my windows xp laptop right now, downloading the 6.1 i386, to get wifi working
[01:16] <eps> curs0r righto
[01:16] <reverseblade> wall86, what computer ?
[01:17] <Lunar_Lamp> <PhibreOptix> Hey guys, what is a beowulf cluster? <== it's a way of joining together lots of compouters into, in effect, a single entity that it more powerful.
[01:17] <wall86> so, i have no access to anything within ubuntu
[01:17] <eps> mneptok well I've got nothing better to do before some one wanders along and suggests an answer to my question
[01:17] <ken> EdLin: That is already enabled
[01:17] <un_operateur1> guys, ken, mneptok -- am i the only one seeing this -- http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/opera/  ??
[01:17] <mneptok> eps: not my problem. but people abusing one another on IRC *is* my problem. so please stop.
[01:17] <PhibreOptix> Lunar_Lamp: That is cool
[01:17] <EdLin> ken: and you've run apt-get update?
[01:17] <wall86> phibreoptix, 10 p2's at 333 Mhz = 1 p4 at like 2+ Ghz :)
[01:18] <Lunar_Lamp> I am looking to install ubuntu server edition (6.06).  How do I find out what versions of mysql, php, and perl would be available to me in the default repositories?
[01:18] <un_operateur1> I dont think opera classifies its .debs via release candidates anyway
[01:18] <mneptok> un_operateur1: look at the date on those. and just because it's in /pool doesn;t mean it gets filtered into a production repo
[01:18] <eps> mneptok I only retaliated; which if some one is abusive to me first I reserve the right to.  Though I will restrain myself if it happens again tonight
[01:18] <reverseblade> wall86, is this a notebook ?
[01:18] <ken> un_operateur1: But i dont get it when i search in synaptic ;-|
[01:18] <Lunar_Lamp> PhibreOptix, unfortunately I don't know much more than that, so it you're interested you'll have to excercise your google skills.
[01:18] <serishema> lunar_lap: you can search the repositories for a given version on the ubuntu website
[01:18] <ken> edlin: for what?
[01:18] <curs0r> !RTM | Lunar_Lamp
[01:18] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[01:18] <wall86> this laptop is right now, installing ubuntu on my desktop,
[01:18] <frogzoo> Lunar_Lamp: http://packages.ubuntu.com/ - also consider 6.10
[01:18] <Lunar_Lamp> serishema, whereabouts? I looked for it but couldn't find it :-/
[01:19] <EdLin> ken: hmm, yes, opera is not in the commercial repo anymore. Strange. Just get it from opera.com then.
[01:19] <un_operateur1> ken, mneptok -- there's always opera's own repo if you seek beelding-edge updates
[01:19] <reverseblade> wall86,  for which computer do you have  your problems ?
[01:19] <twissy> ken: if u read the channel, u would be ready 20 mins. ago
[01:19] <qmf> frogzoo: didn't fix it. but i did disable ipv6 dns in firefox and it did the trick.. so that was def the problem. how do i disable ipv6 fully then.. hm
[01:19] <wall86> i want to install ubuntu on this piece of shat, but i have to do a boot from windows to install, how to guide does not work
[01:19] <serishema> http://packages.ubuntu.com/
[01:19] <wall86> im having probs with my desktops wda-1320 athero wifi card.
[01:19] <Lunar_Lamp> frogzoo, I chose 6.06 over 6.10 due to long term support.  The server would be running mission critical stuff, and I didn't want to risk edgy.
[01:19] <ken> twissy: i thought my repo list was broken. DO you understand why i went through all this trouble?
[01:19] <frogzoo> qmf: wget doesn't start straight away?
[01:19] <reverseblade> wireless | wall86
[01:19] <ken> edlin: un_operateur1: Thank you anyways!

[01:20] <mneptok> eps: we reserve the right to remove abusive people from the channel, whether they "started it" or not. ;)
[01:20] <serishema> lunar_lamp: if it's running mission critical stuff shouldn't you have a support contract?
[01:20] <mneptok> un_operateur1: "use the Opera build" is what i have been saying to ken for the past 15 minutes. ;)
[01:20] <wall86> read all through it, for 2 days/nights straight
[01:20] <reverseblade> wall86, your card may not be supported. but you can use ndiswrapper
[01:20] <_Rappy_> what alternatives are there to running windows-programs (games) in WINE?
[01:20] <Lunar_Lamp> serishema, it's not running anything *yet* and we can't afford a support contract :-p
[01:20] <EdLin> ken: opera.com has debs to install with dpkg -i, go there.
[01:20] <reverseblade> wall86, tried ndiswrapper ?
[01:20] <wall86> and at work (shhh don't tell them)
[01:20] <stefg> wall86: Erm, maybe you could rephrase that question in , errr, more technical terms... waht's the situation, and what do you want to do exactly?
[01:20] <serishema> lunar_lamp: Ah understandable.
[01:20] <un_operateur1> ken, mneptok and for those interested - - deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free
[01:20] <frogzoo> Lunar_Lamp: the packages in edgy for most everything are newer, but yes, your upgrade cycle would be shorter
[01:20] <mneptok> Lunar_Lamp: sure you can. support contracts are cheap. :)
[01:20] <qmf> frogzoo: no, it takes 20 seconds on resolving...
[01:20] <serishema> lunar_lamp: been in similar situations
[01:20] <eps> mneptok then if you stick by the policy in place there wont be a need for me to retaliate against any abusive parties
[01:20] <wall86> no net on desktop without the wificard......
[01:20] <ken> edlin: i know,
[01:20] <wall86> i need madwifi
[01:20] <ken> un_operateur1: ok
[01:20] <EdLin> ken: what, you don't trust opera.com? ;-)
[01:21] <reverseblade> I see
[01:21] <wall86> but, can i download it under xp, put it on a flash, then install into ubuntu?
[01:21] <mneptok> wall86: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules
[01:21] <Lunar_Lamp> <mneptok> Lunar_Lamp: sure you can. support contracts are cheap. :) <== Quite probably, but they aren't free unfortunately :-(
[01:21] <IndyGUnFreak> How do I change, for instance, all of my MP3's, to use a specific Icon, instead of the default one?
[01:21] <ken> edlin: those are the freakin proprietery vendors. So NO
[01:21] <reverseblade> wall86, yes sure
=== kelateclan is now known as jengc0il
[01:21] <qmf> frogzoo: i'll change the ipv6 setting to alias - net-pf-10 off -
[01:21] <frogzoo> eps: can't be done
[01:21] <EdLin> ken: well, opera is propritary no matter where you get it from.
[01:21] <stefg> wall86: with a bit of tweaking you could... what's wrong with downloadinf an .iso and burning it to a install CD?
[01:21] <PhibreOptix> I was wondering if anybody else is having the same issue I am with frostwire, if I have XMMS open when I start Frostwire, then I can't preview music files as they download, even if I close XMMS
[01:21] <ken> edlin: Thank you for telling me that :-)
[01:21] <mneptok> ken: there is *NO DIFFERENCE* between a build Opera gives you and one Canonical gives you. none. zip. nada. zero.
[01:22] <wall86> i love opera, i do not care if it is proprietary, it got me off of MSIE
[01:22] <ken> mneptok: i know that
[01:22] <un_operateur1>  deb http://deb.opera.com/opera etch non-free
[01:22] <vaineh> does anyone know if a netgear pcmcia wireless wg511t card is supported out of the box by edgy?
[01:22] <reverseblade> wall86, firefox 2.0 is better
[01:22] <mneptok> ken: so then why not get it from Opera?
[01:22] <eps> frogzoo ah; so out of interest when will ubuntu be releasing a version where there isn't some thing majorly wrong with the way the kernel was compiled/the matched gcc version/the headers
[01:22] <EdLin> un_operateur1: you might not want to do that - library differences
[01:22] <wall86> i am downloading 6.1, on here to burn .iso then install on desktop
[01:22] <ken> mneptok: i thought my repos list was broken, thats why i was trying to mend it, rather than getting opera
[01:23] <wall86> I "accidentally" ;) wiped out my windows partition....... on my desktop
[01:23] <un_operateur1> EdLin, there are no differences here  -- the only candidate that matters for opera is non-free
[01:23] <eps> for example this copy of xubuntu come with 17-10-386 but installed the 17-10-generic headers...which I thought was a nice little trick
[01:23] <nevron> wall86 thnak you to all who answered mergedfb works
[01:23] <un_operateur1> EdLin, as in : http://deb.opera.com/opera/pool/non-free/o/opera/
[01:23] <EdLin> un_operateur1: the Qt libraries could be different.
[01:23] <rcrook> god I hate java
[01:23] <wall86> kk, wicked awesome nevron
[01:23] <nevron> :)
[01:23] <curs0r> rcrook, i feel your pain
[01:23] <un_operateur1> EdLin, but they arent
[01:24] <serishema> me too.
[01:24] <wall86> i think when i get another monitor i will try dual monitoring
[01:24] <serishema> it's gotten into comp sci departments everywhere
[01:24] <ken> Someone hating java, is hurting me
[01:24] <frogzoo> eps: can't say I've had a problem, where'd you get your kernel source?
[01:24] <nevron> wall86 do you know if this setup lets users have direct rendering
[01:24] <stefg> eps, one of the facts of life (as i learned) is: stock ubuntu-kernels are broken... so my last reminiscence of gentoo is that i still need to compile my own kernel ..:-)
[01:24] <un_operateur1> EdLin, and opera doesnt maintain Qt
[01:24] <PhibreOptix> What's a good language to learn to create cross platform games?
[01:24] <wall86> or maybe an HDTV..... my video card supports it......
[01:24] <EdLin> un_operateur1: maybe not today, but tomorrow maybe - better to get the Ubuntu debs from opera.com. Mixing Debian and Ubuntu reps in general is risky.
[01:24] <serishema> that said it's not that bad.
[01:24] <curs0r> serishema, i cry myself to sleep over c# as it is lol
[01:24] <wall86> i have no idea, sry
[01:24] <EdLin> un_operateur1: which has what relevance?
[01:24] <eps> stefg heh :P
[01:24] <nevron> ok thanks anyways
[01:24] <serishema> curs0r: that's a bit overboard.
[01:24] <rcrook> sigh.. dowloaded and installed eclipse and it wont start... straight from the repos... sigh.... god I hate java.. wont even run a java IDE.
[01:25] <curs0r> serishema, it's just too easy, feels like cheating
[01:25] <cmt^^> serishema - i've opened ports 8192 udp/tcp and set linuxdc++ to use that port.. but I keep getting disconnected
[01:25] <serishema> cmt^^ i've never actually used dc++ so i can't suggest anything else.
[01:25] <ken> Good bye, and Good <part of the day>, the last tag depends upon your time zone :) Keep the community alive. Thank you
[01:25] <wall86> im about ready to say screw all thius fiddling and just install my 5.04 ubuntu
[01:25] <whadar> does tasksel work for anyone? it is simply exit when i run it... and the gnome version crushes
[01:25] <un_operateur1> EdLin, there is no relevance -- there is only one candidate that opera maintains i.e. non-free -- its the same used in debian or ubuntu -- and opera doesnt maintain any libraries Qt or otherwise -- as for relevance, you tell em
[01:26] <EdLin> un_operateur1: it *uses* Qt.
[01:26] <eps> is there some magical way I could get a 2.6.18 kernel under ubuntu 6.10 without compiling my own?
[01:26] <IndyGUnFreak> Does anyone know how to change the default icon for a file type, so that all files of that type have the new icon?
[01:26] <serishema> curso0r: I just don't like it when they force us to use it to try and write operating system like stuff in.
[01:26] <EdLin> un_operateur1: or do you think that it has no dependencies?
[01:26] <un_operateur1> EdLin, and you get libqt-xx from your ubuntu/debian repos not operas :)
[01:26] <wall86> gah, guess i don't sleep tonight.
[01:26] <wall86> darn coffee, but it is sooooo good
[01:27] <EdLin> un_operateur1: my point exactly, it could have significant differences.
[01:27] <EdLin> un_operateur1: if you want to risk running multiple distro repositories, go ahead, but if you recommend it to someone else don't expect me to not mention the problems in doing that.
[01:27] <wall86> hey, guess what people, my windows xp has a virus :o
[01:27] <un_operateur1> EdLin, why dont you head on over to opera's pool and see how many packages they maintain -- and whether they maintain different packages for ubuntu and debian
[01:27] <EdLin> un_operateur1: they do on opera.com
[01:27] <szkola> siema
[01:28] <curs0r> serishema, not that i'm against managed code, but my imagination is limited as it is lol
[01:28] <szkola> hello
[01:28] <twissy> siema szkola
[01:28] <un_operateur1> EdLin, I am talking about opera's own repo -- http://deb.opera.com/opera/pool/
[01:28] <EdLin> un_operateur1: yes, but it specificially has an etch tag.
[01:29] <whadar> sudo /usr/bin/gnome-tasksel gives me: "ImportError: No module named xreadlines" any clue what happened?
[01:29] <un_operateur1> Edlin, which has no effect really becuase there are no etch or edgy packages on that repo
[01:29] <r0ck> Is anyone here using Frostwire_
[01:29] <EdLin> un_operateur1: that's true, because it gets the dependencies from the normal etch repos
[01:29] <r0ck> ?
[01:29] <nevron> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290841&highlight=aiglx should i use this forum to enable aiglx or is there a better source?
[01:30] <curs0r> serishema, i believe i might have to take a look at beryl's plugin framework
[01:30] <EdLin> un_operateur1: I think I've spent enough time arguing about mixing Debian and Ubuntu repos before breakfast... :-)
[01:30] <jrib> !anyone | r0ck
[01:30] <Ubotwo> r0ck: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[01:30] <wall86> nevron, have you tried googling it? that seems like a lot of hassle
[01:30] <UbnNoob> I have this file NVIDIA-setting.dekstop\apps.\share\usr but it does not show up in the menu in Ubuntu. How do I get it to show up?
[01:31] <nevron> ok  i ll try to google maybe wiki has a source
[01:31] <wall86> lol, earlier, i was asking, but nobody was responding
[01:31] <r0ck> Because I followed this guide for installing java, and now when I try to run Frostwire I get this error that my java is to old (1.4, need 1.5)
[01:32] <jrib> r0ck: what guide?  did you install java from the repositories?
[01:32] <curs0r> r0ck, what is frostwire?
[01:32] <EdLin> r0ck: apt-get install sun-java5-jre - from multiverse repos
[01:32] <wall86> curs0r, i believe frostwire is just a dif version of limewire...... i think......
[01:32] <jrib> !frostwire
[01:32] <Ubotwo> frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[01:32] <curs0r> ah... music piracy is wrong

[01:34] <wall86> not if ya know what ya are doing
[01:34] <IndyGUnFreak> *kidding
[01:34] <curs0r> there's always nicotine as well
[01:34] <IndyGUnFreak> is spyware really a problem on Linux?
=== contarc__ is now known as wildkarde
[01:34] <wall86> lol, not really, i guess the whole "market share" is kind of a blessing in disguise
[01:34] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, its rampant and we're always suffering :)
[01:35] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[01:35] <IndyGUnFreak> i love satire..lol
[01:35] <un_operateur1> j/k -- spyware, it's almost non-existant this side of the fence
[01:35] <IndyGUnFreak> its just someone mentioned the rampant spyware on bearshare, thats why i asked.
[01:35] <wall86> since linux is not as widely used as windows, what person wants to waste there time on writing mal ware for it,m when they can hit more people a lot easier
[01:35] <IndyGUnFreak> i thought so.
[01:35] <IndyGUnFreak> anyone have any ide aon my icon question, its driving me nuts
[01:36] <IndyGUnFreak> i know i've done it before, but i can't remember how.
[01:36] <curs0r> the wildly varying kernel versions help that too ;)
[01:36] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, whats your "icon question" ?
[01:36] <EdLin> wall86: it's a lot harder to make spyware for Linux.
[01:36] <wall86> Indy, i have no idea, sorry, im just a newb
[01:36] <IndyGUnFreak> i want to change the default icon of a file type, for example, MP3's, to an icon i downloaded.
[01:36] <nevron> will aiglx work with ati driver or should i change it to radeon instead and also how can i know that radeon driver is already installed or not?
[01:36] <IndyGUnFreak> i can do it one a ta time, but with about 2gigs worth of music, it will take a while..lol
[01:37] <IndyGUnFreak> i know i've done it under FC5, but i cant' remember how.
[01:37] <wall86> nevron, lshw, find your card
[01:37] <jrib> IndyGUnFreak: you'd have to edit your icon theme afaik
[01:37] <curs0r> IndyGUnFreak, i think icons are handled by your gtk/gnome theme
[01:37] <wall86> i know how to change icons in windows !
[01:37] <IndyGUnFreak> how would i edit that?
[01:37] <wall86> but who doesn't?
[01:37] <IndyGUnFreak> lol.
[01:38] <wall86> nevron, run lshw, see if your card shows up
[01:38] <curs0r> i still can't figure out why it takes 3-5 minutes for gtk apps to load over xdmcp if i can play neverball
[01:38] <jrib> IndyGUnFreak: it's easy if you are using one in ~/.icons , just navigate to that directory and replace the appropriate icon(s)
[01:38] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, I think -- gnome-theme-manager
[01:38] <wall86> 40 mins till ubuntu goodness!!!!!
[01:38] <EdLin> if it's on the desktop, you *can* change the icon
[01:39] <EdLin> without changing the theme
[01:39] <vaineh> how do i enable network-manager to use wireless networks? all i see in the drop down list is "wired network"
[01:39] <nevron> wall86 do you know if it makes a difference when i write ati or radeon under section device driver?
[01:40] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm jrib, there's no icons in my /.icons folder
[01:40] <wall86> sry, i have no clue.....
[01:40] <nevron> :(
[01:40] <wall86> lshw, is just the way i was told to find pci info
[01:40] <curs0r> IndyGUnFreak, in gnome it goes way deeper than that
[01:40] <nevron> i have found a tutorial and it says write radeon but i am afraid to mess up this thing up
[01:40] <jrib> IndyGUnFreak: then you are using something in /usr/share/icons.  I would copy the theme to ~/.icons, give it a new name (there might be some config file), and then edit the theme to whatever you want
[01:41] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm, why must this simple task be that complex.
[01:41] <frogzoo> nevron: fglrx will get you the fglrx driver, ati will get you the ati driver
[01:41] <curs0r> IndyGUnFreak, because gnome has deep roots
[01:41] <wall86> nevron, find a way to back up your data
[01:41] <EdLin> deep roots?
[01:42] <wall86> and maybe try it in a "safe mode" of some kind.....
[01:42] <nevron> frogzoo it s ok but to enable aiglx it says that the driver mustt be radeon not ati
[01:42] <IndyGUnFreak> the icon i want to use, is a custom one i downloaded.
[01:42] <EdLin> wall86: there is no "safe mode"
[01:42] <wall86> maybe someone with more ubuntu experience be bale to fill in what i am asking
[01:42] <nevron> i have just backed things up and am trying a restart i ll let you know how it goes
[01:42] <wall86> what about a safe graphics mode? thought i had read bout one pone forums
[01:42] <wall86> on***
[01:43] <EdLin> wall86: if the settings are wrong it doesn't go into a "safe mode"
[01:43] <wall86> i know,
[01:44] <EdLin> wall86: in fact, X was known to fry monitors if it had the wrong scan settings back in the old days.
[01:44] <wall86> but is there a way to start ubuntu in some kind of a safe graphics mode? or alternative log in?
[01:44] <davidwinter> hi all
[01:44] <ariccs> hello
[01:45] <davidwinter> I'm trying to install the Nvidia drivers for my GeForce 6200
[01:45] <davidwinter> I'm on an AMD64, but running Edgy Eft i386
[01:45] <EdLin> wall86: I guess you could run startx with an alternate configuration file set to use vga or vesa
[01:45] <EdLin> wall86: it wouldn't be of any use in configuring your system though.
[01:45] <davidwinter> I've got the linux restricted modules generic installed because when I do `uname -r` I get:
[01:45] <davidwinter> 2.6.17-10-generic
[01:46] <davidwinter> after install nvidia-glx
[01:46] <davidwinter> and then trying to enable via `sudo nvidia-glx-config enable`
[01:46] <davidwinter> I get the following
[01:46] <davidwinter> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[01:46] <davidwinter> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[01:46] <curs0r> ugh it is most difficult to find a decent looking dark gtk theme
[01:46] <ariccs> haha i know what you mean curs0r
[01:47] <EdLin> davidwinter: this is a known problem - go to ubuntuforums for help, the link on it is on the front page.
[01:47] <davidwinter> ok, thanks EdLin

[01:48] <Zodiac`> how to open .package in ubuntu???
[01:49] <c1ru> hey, i have a proble with quake4, i think my graphic card dont work nice, i need more fps, in glxgears i have 17000 all time, and people say i have to obtain more, i use driver nvidia and 7900gtx, what can i do? apologize about my english
[01:50] <magic_ninja> yay
[01:50] <Zodiac`> 17000 fps? WTF? (in ET 125 is muuuuch)
[01:50] <magic_ninja> finally got my beast back in order with a new 256 mb ddr graphics card
[01:50] <Zodiac`> how to open .package in ubuntu???
[01:50] <method|> something is wrong. when I type df it says that I have no space left. i'm deleting stuff off my harddrive and it still says i have no space left. for some reason the things im deleting isnt going to trash either
[01:50] <method|> what's the deal?
[01:50] <magic_ninja> will ubuntu install nvidia drivers by default
[01:51] <magic_ninja> method|: are you in a terminal
[01:51] <method|> i have a konsole open
[01:51] <magic_ninja> method|: what you delete from terminal doesn't go into trash
[01:51] <vaineh> why is it so hard to connect to a wireless network
[01:51] <method|> im not deleting through the terminal
[01:52] <c1ru> i need to load more modules on my drivers for obtain better fps?
[01:52] <magic_ninja> i can't wait to get cedega up with diablo II and such
[01:52] <majortom> is this good advice on backing up my root? http://www.hddsaver.com/content/26/index.html
[01:53] <frogzoo> method|: when you delete a file, the space isn't freed off disk until everything stops accessing that file
[01:53] <method|> frogzoo: these are just random useless videos and mp3s
[01:53] <method|> deleting a file shouldnt be advanced calculus theory
[01:53] <frogzoo> method|: then maybe you're looking on the wrong file system?
[01:54] <frogzoo> method|: it's not - it's very straight forward 'df -h'
[01:54] <method|> no. usually when I delete a file. it deletes. i know how to use df -h, and usually deleting a file works the correct way
[01:54] <method|> the problem is now that I've deleted files but for some reason linux doesnt think so
[01:54] <deborah> hello
[01:55] <deborah> hi room :)
[01:55] <method|> something must be wrong because now anything i delete isnt going to trash
[01:55] <wall86> hi deborah

[01:55] <Ubotwo> wipe - Secure file deletion - available in Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) - See http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for more information
[01:55] <method|> im thinking that is the problem
[01:56] <wall86> any luck nevron?
[01:56] <method|> i need help tho
[01:56] <method|> cause i need to install this package
[01:56] <method|> but i cant if i dont have any space
[01:56] <frogzoo> method|: which file system is full?
[01:57] <un_operateur1> method|, in nautilus -- edit > preferences > behaviour -- check there to see if delete's working the way you expect it to be
[01:57] <nevron> wall86 how can i know if i have direct rendering?
[01:57] <method|> Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

[01:57] <un_operateur1> whoa, thats odd
[01:57] <frogzoo> method|: are you deleting from a terminal, or using nautilus?
[01:58] <wall86> i hate to say it, but i am clueless......
[01:58] <nevron> :)
[01:58] <method|> frogzoo: im actually using konqueror
[01:58] <torpor> i've verified that my card is the truemobile 1150 (DELL) and its using the orinoco drivers .. anyone got any clues what i have to do to get ubuntu/kubuntu to recognize it properly?  it seems that red hat 8.0 works fine with this card ..
[01:58] <sc0tt> nevron: glxinfo
[01:58] <sc0tt> i think shows that
[01:58] <jrib> nevron: glxinfo| grep direct
[01:58] <method|> but im not using the terminal
[01:58] <wall86> gah, i hate not knowing anything!
[01:58] <frogzoo> method|: well then konq is just moving the file to trash, not sure, look in .trash maybe?
[01:58] <wall86> where can i find a book on ubuntu? so i can learn some stuff?
[01:59] <frogzoo> !documentation | wall86
[01:59] <Ubotwo> wall86: documentation is to be found at http://help.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com - General linux documentation: http://www.tldp.org - http://rute.2038bug.com
[01:59] <method|> frogzoo: yeah that's the thing. there's nothing in .trash either

[01:59] <un_operateur1> method|, check your konqueror's preferences -- maybe you have some setting set that meddles with the usual trash behaviour
[01:59] <frogzoo> wall86: also try clicking on the 'help' icon
[01:59] <jrib> wall86: search amazon for "official ubuntu book" if you want something on paper, but those online goods are very good
[01:59] <nevron> wal86 i just typed glxinfo in a terminal and saw that i dont have direct rendering right now :(
[01:59] <[GuS] > i am using Kubuntu Edgy mad64
[01:59] <[GuS] > amd*
[02:00] <wall86> ya, i have read through some of that stuff, someone should make an "ubuntu for dummies"
[02:00] <method|> where is the trash folder?
[02:00] <josh_> whats up everyone? anyone in here with a intel 965 board figured out how to get around the "raid" controller installation problem?
[02:00] <un_operateur1> method|, errm -- ~/.trash or ~/.Trash i think
[02:01] <method|> it's not there :/
[02:01] <nevron> jrib should i enable the composite extension in my xorg.conf
[02:01] <jrib> method|: files won't get deleted if they are being used even if they aren't visible isn't visible
[02:01] <wall86> what version of madwifi should i download? the .bz2, or the .gz? so i can unpack and install in ubuntu 6.1 i386?
[02:01] <frogzoo> method|: at the top of the file system I expect
[02:01] <jrib> nevron: you should get direct rendering enabled first.  What card?
[02:02] <un_operateur1> method|, hmm   du -s ~/.Trash/
[02:02] <un_operateur1> 16      /home/user/.Trash/
[02:02] <rapid_> wall86, either of the 2
[02:02] <nevron> it is a radeon 9800 pro
[02:02] <rapid_> wall86, the bz2 will be smaller naturally.
[02:02] <nevron> i am using the radeon drivers so that i can aiglx
[02:02] <un_operateur1> maybe KDE uses a different trash folder??
[02:02] <wall86> ok, i should have no problems just picking one then?
[02:02] <method|> du: cannot access `/home/duane/.Trash/': No such file or directory
[02:02] <rapid_> wall86, the bz2 is just a better compression method than the .gz format
[02:02] <josh_> do a "sudo updatedb;locate Trash"
[02:02] <un_operateur1> method|, you could find out if there's other --- find ~ | grep -i trash
[02:02] <rapid_> wall86: so for people with slower connections downloading the bz2 would be the prefered method.
[02:02] <frogzoo> method|: is this a usb drive?
[02:03] <method|> frogzoo: no
[02:03] <wall86> kk, ubuntu can decompress both? (sorry, i just wanna make sure, downloading takes a while for me)
[02:03] <rapid_> wall86, i'd get the bz2
[02:03] <method|> un_operateur1: thanks i found it
[02:03] <rapid_> wall86, and yes, ubuntu should have no problems opening both
[02:03] <wall86> ok,
[02:04] <un_operateur1> method|, there may be hidden (dot-files) in your trash folder that might not be visible normally -- make sure thats not the case
[02:04] <nevron> jrib do you have any suggestions for me
[02:04] <diodo> yes
[02:04] <rapid_> wall86, I take it you have an atheros based card.
[02:04] <frogzoo> method|: find /root/of/drive -size +100M -exec ls -l {} \;
[02:05] <kurei> how do i make java 6 my default jre?
[02:05] <josh_> anyone in here with a c2d system?
[02:05] <jrib> nevron: I don't know about ati cards, have you been linked to the wiki?
[02:05] <method|> ok
[02:05] <method|> i figured it out
[02:05] <ski-worklap> josh_, yes, it gets very hot.
=== Dani_ is now known as ubunbunbunbun
[02:05] <nevron> jrib i have everything correct all i need is a command under xorg to enable direct rendering
[02:05] <method|> for some reason my trash icon isn't mapped to my actual trash directory
[02:05] <josh_> what mobo chiptset u using ski-worklap ?
=== vlt|afk is now known as vlt
[02:06] <josh_> s/chiptset/chipset
[02:06] <frogzoo> method|: if you use konq under gnome, it won't be
[02:06] <ski-worklap> josh_, whatever comes in a macbook pro :)
[02:06] <ski-worklap> intel something or other
[02:06] <method|> frogzoo: im using kde
[02:06] <un_operateur1> kurei,   update-alternatives --config java
[02:06] <curs0r> ha! i finally figured out where the main menu button file is
[02:07] <frogzoo> method|: the trash icon is just for your home, if you're on a different filesystem, there's a different trash folder
[02:07] <nevron> jrib i am trying the option composite enable and hoping to get back here
[02:07] <un_operateur1> curs0r, yea, where is it? :)
[02:07] <curs0r> /usr/share/icons/Human/48x48/places
[02:07] <wall86> ok, for some reason, my computer is downloading the .bz2, as a .tar, will this be a problem?
[02:07] <curs0r> replace 48x48 with individual sizes
[02:07] <kurei> un_operateur1, how do i add java 6 to the list of alternatives?
[02:07] <un_operateur1> curs0r, that is if you are using the Human theme
[02:08] <ski-worklap> wall86, no. your client is just "smart" and says "oh, i know how to deal with bz2", and is un-b2ing it on the fly
[02:08] <curs0r> un_operateur1, it's complicated, beryl has made the gnome-theme manager pretty much useless to me
[02:08] <ubuntu> hey THis chat client have bug i send it to bugzila
[02:09] <ski-worklap> wow, ubuntu himself :)
[02:09] <r0ck> Why wireless won't work.  I have to get real close to get connection and when I get connection(ip) I can't surf or do anything.  And I know the wireless work because it works fine on my other computer
[02:09] <curs0r> ski-worklap, haha
[02:10] <boggle> r0ck: have you got a connection at all? is there an ip adress assigned to you? can you ping your gateway?
[02:10] <wall86> what other apps, should i download now that i might need for setting up wireless on my laptop?
[02:11] <kurei> how do i add java 6 to the list of java alternatives?
[02:11] <mneptok> wall86: sudo aptitude install network-manager-gnome
[02:11] <ski-worklap> kurei, scroll up, someone already told you that :0
[02:11] <wall86> do i need to download it from net?
[02:11] <un_operateur1> kurei, you there?
[02:11] <henning> Can anybody help me with this? I cannot log into my Gnome Desktop. My mistake was to send the command "sudo chmod -r *". Aftert this I wasn't able to login again. By logging in I got the error message ".dmrc has to have 644 rights and the home folder has to by owned by this user..." After doing the 644 chmod and chown commands I can login but the Gnome Desktop doesn't start. Pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1 works for getting into console.
[02:12] <kurei> un_operateur1, yep
[02:12] <ski-worklap> specifically, kurei: update-alternatives --config java
[02:12] <eps> lol
[02:12] <boggle> henning: check the files in /tmp, probably delete or chown them as well
[02:12] <kurei> ski-worklap, the thing is, mustang isnt in the list of alternatives yet
[02:12] <ubuntu> http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=387140
[02:12] <majortom> if my / is 2.5 gb does it make sense that it tar'ed to about 816 megs?
[02:12] <r0ck> boggle: I get an ip adress yeah
[02:12] <ubuntu> this is the bug from the chat
[02:12] <un_operateur1> kurei -- it's update-alternatives --install -- check the man page or update-alternatives --help    .. an example goes like this -- sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-3.4 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-3.4
[02:12] <mneptok> henning: boot to a console and fix the permissions of your drive.
[02:12] <boggle> r0ck: you can ping the router?
[02:13] <r0ck> boggle: and it works to connect using the wired network
[02:13] <eps> majortom it really depends...though tar can be a very good compressor
[02:13] <ubuntu> now how to make kerio mail server for linux to work automaticly
[02:13] <ski-worklap> kurei, if you want to live on the bleeding edge like that, you're going to need to figure out how to make it so yourself :)
[02:13] <r0ck> boggle: brb then. have to dc from the wire to do it
[02:13] <mneptok> boggle: did you have him run ifconfig and iwconfig? ;)
[02:13] <kurei> un_operateur1, thanks a lot!
[02:13] <ubuntu> becouse when i start manualy and surf to the localhost:83 the web site open and then the mail server swith off
[02:13] <un_operateur1> kurei, yw
[02:13] <majortom> eps, i would just like to back up my root and not my /home because it is on a separate partition so it doesn't make sense for this application so i tar'ed it to about 816 megs
[02:13] <boggle> mneptok: will be a start
[02:14] <ubuntu> Hey someone here
[02:14] <henning> mneptok: permission of which drive?
[02:14] <majortom> i left some other stuff out, i've just never backed up before so i'm not sure
[02:14] <mneptok> henning: the drive/partition you ran chmod on
[02:14] <r0ck> yeah
[02:14] <r0ck> boggle: I'm able to ping the router
[02:14] <henning> the partition is owned by root
[02:14] <eps> majortom you only really need to backup your /home/* dirs, and /etc config files if you change any
[02:14] <ski-worklap> ubuntu, no, no one is here. you are seeing a replay of yesteday's show. please do not call in.
[02:14] <eps> the rest you can just install a new base system
[02:14] <mneptok> henning: basically, that chmod command you gave removed the read permission on *every file*. not good.
[02:15] <_Rappy_> I'll try again: I'm looking for an alternative to WINE, to run a couple of WIN32-games. Can anyone recommend another app?
[02:15] <ski-worklap> _Rappy_, kqemu
[02:15] <ubuntu> ski-worklap are you bot.
[02:15] <wall86> cedega
[02:15] <ski-worklap> or vmware
[02:15] <majortom> eps, what i like to do is try out new distros, but i always come back to ubuntu, all i want to do is save the trouble of re-installing all my apps and settings
[02:15] <_Rappy_> ski-worklap & wall86 : thanks :)
[02:15] <ubuntu> majorstom man
[02:15] <un_operateur1> !debootstrap
[02:15] <Ubotwo> debootstrap - Bootstrap a basic Debian system - available in Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) - See http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for more information
[02:15] <majortom> that is why me /home is on /dev/hda7 so everywhere distro i go to is /home
[02:15] <derFlo> how can i mount sysfs?
[02:15] <mneptok> majortom: apps will be a PITA. but you can save settings by putting /home on a separate partition
[02:15] <un_operateur1> majortom,   ^^^^
[02:16] <r0ck> boggle: Im not a registered user, so I can't PM. but I can ping the router yeah
[02:16] <ski-worklap> ubuntu, parse error at char 33: got EOF, expected token
[02:16] <ubuntu> ski-worklap what???
[02:16] <eps> majortom the settings are _all_ stored in /home/myuser/ directory (for end user apps)...but it's all upto you :)
[02:16] <derFlo> how to mount sysfs, guys?
[02:16] <henning> mneptok: so whats the right command to change the permissions for the whole partition? chmod -R 644 * ?
[02:16] <mneptok> ski-worklap: !rehash
[02:16] <eps> I would suggest that 800meg or so is a reasonable expectation of a complete tar archive of the data set
[02:17] <syock> Haha I come to this channel often but contribute almost zero
[02:17] <syock> sorry!
[02:17] <un_operateur1> derFlo, its done automatically -- its not for you to worry about
[02:17] <mneptok> henning: you don't *want* every file to have read permissions. that's the problem. there's no easy way to undo what you did.
[02:17] <henning> aha
[02:17] <derFlo> un_operateur1: a prog. says that it isnt mounted
[02:17] <ubuntu> man there have a max permission
[02:17] <majortom> eps, so if i wipe my / partition reinstall and untar my backup to / it should be exactly as it is now
[02:17] <ubuntu> chmod 0777
[02:17] <henning> hmm
[02:17] <un_operateur1> derFlo -- have you tried a reboot?
[02:18] <majortom> and of course i won't hold you to it, its not a big deal if it doesn't work, i'm just want to save myself some trouble
[02:18] <r0ck> boggle: if it's to crowded you can always join the boggle channel ^^
[02:18] <derFlo> un_operateur1: yes
[02:18] <derFlo> un_operateur1: lm-sensors needs it.
[02:18] <ski-worklap> !rehash
[02:18] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[02:18] <ski-worklap> mneptok, what?
[02:18] <un_operateur1> what does this command say?? mount
[02:18] <eps> majortom possibly; make sure your tar arch stores file permissions and symbolic links etc
[02:18] <ubuntu> ubotwo kerio
[02:18] <Ubotwo> ubuntu: Error: "kerio" is not a valid command.
[02:18] <eps> and well yeah I guess that would work
[02:18] <mneptok> ski-worklap: thought you needed a rehash
[02:19] <mneptok> ski-worklap: (being a bot and all)
[02:19] <ski-worklap> my aliases are up to date
[02:19] <ski-worklap> thank you
[02:19] <majortom> eps, thanks, i will try it, just not now i have to go to work soon
[02:19] <henning> mneptok: can u propose me the right mode for system folders and whats the right chmod for /tmp/ & /var/ ?
[02:19] <eps> hehe
[02:20] <eps> w00t got the video dvb drivers to work together :D:D:D
[02:20] <mneptok> henning: no, i cannot tell you the correct permissions for the hundreds of files in those directories.
[02:20] <henning> so do u propose a complete reinstall of ubuntu as the most easiest way?
[02:20] <mneptok> henning: "I just burned my house to the ground. How can I use water and a copy of 'The Grapes Of Wrath' to rebuild my house from the ashes?"  <-- same question ;)
[02:21] <mneptok> henning: a re-install is, without a doubt, the path of least resistance
[02:21] <mneptok> (sorry)
[02:21] <un_operateur1> henning, why do you want to modify those permissions?
[02:21] <henning> it was a mistkae
[02:21] <henning> *mistake
[02:21] <henning> I wanted to chmod a folder with its subfolders
[02:22] <eps> henning you can do some major things to cut down your setup time when you reinstall though
[02:22] <saharaab> !mp3
[02:22] <Ubotwo> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[02:22] <henning> but I chmodded the whole partition
[02:22] <henning> aha?
[02:22] <un_operateur1> henning -- ouch
[02:22] <saharaab> !playvideo
[02:22] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[02:22] <dabaR> henning: and what is the ooutput of ls -ld /?
[02:22] <saharaab> !playvideo
[02:22] <eps> for example, backup your ~/ dir and copy all of the .* folders in it - that will carry all of your userland settigns across to the new version
[02:23] <eps> also getting apt-get to do a dump of all of your installed programs so you can get them next time
[02:23] <un_operateur1> -- /var - 0766  - /tmp - 1777  IIRC
[02:23] <eps> wait up henning
[02:23] <henning> ok
[02:23] <mneptok> un_operateur1: now recurse those dirs and set the perms on all the files therein :/
[02:23] <eps> the _ONLY_ think you ran was sudo chmod +r *  ?
[02:23] <henning> "sudo -r *"
[02:24] <henning> sorry
[02:24] <mneptok> henning: no -R ?
[02:24] <henning> "sudo chmod -r *"
[02:24] <un_operateur1> mneptok, well, /tmp doesnt really matter -- it ought to sort itself out -- /var will take some debugging
[02:24] <dabaR> henning: and the ooutput of "ls -ld /" is?
[02:24] <eps> henning you need to be very specific now
[02:24] <henning> all I did was "sudo chmod -r *"
[02:24] <henning> aha
[02:24] <henning> hmm I am here on windows xp
[02:24] <eps> was it a capital 'r' or not?
[02:24] <henning> cannot switch fast to ubuntu
[02:24] <un_operateur1> henning, which directory did you issue that command from?
[02:25] <henning> it was small r
[02:25] <dabaR> henning: ... if yuo want to fix ubuntu, learn to use irssi in console. not hard.
=== navaburo is now known as navabad
[02:25] <eps> then you should be fine
[02:25] <mneptok> henning: "sudo chmod -R -r *" is really, REALLY bad. "sudo chmod -r *" is far less so.
[02:25] <henning> aha
[02:25] <eps> yeah if it was -R fixing it would be a bastard, but if it was -r I believe it will take you minut4es to fix
[02:25] <mneptok> which was it?
[02:25] <henning> but well this smal-r thing resulted in not being able to login
[02:25] <dabaR> same no hard fix
[02:25] <eps> hendrickvp yeah thats still fine
[02:25] <soon> Please suggest: out of 80Gb HD, how much would you set aside for root /  ... I only need root, home and swap?
[02:25] <eps> you just locked all of your gnome config files
[02:26] <henning> aha
[02:26] <mneptok> soon: 10-15GB /, 1GB swap, remainder /home
[02:26] <eps> soon it depends, I usual leave root as 5 gig and then swap at a 1gig and home as the rest
[02:26] <IndyGUnFreak> why do people set a root partition?
[02:26] <eps> mneptok! 10-15 for a linux install!!!???
[02:26] <dabaR> henning: come back when you are in irssi in ubuntu. command to join freenode is /server irc.freenode.net after irssi(apt-get install irssi) and then /j #ubuntu
[02:26] <mneptok> eps: yes.
[02:26] <henning> hmm
[02:26] <soon> IndyGUnFreak ... if you have a seperate /home partition, it makes it easy to backup to external harddrive ...
[02:27] <henning> I just use two partitions / and /swap
[02:27] <eps> IndyGUnFreak well all of your user settings are stored in your /home directory - so if you ever just want to blow away your install without losing your settings you just clear the / dir :)
[02:27] <dabaR> henning: what does that have to do with anything?
[02:27] <IndyGUnFreak> i see, makes sense
[02:27] <IndyGUnFreak> if i want to blow away my ins tall, i simply reinstal and get back to where iw as from my backups
[02:27] <un_operateur1> IndyGUnFreak, paritioning makes it easier to manage different compartments of the file system -- it increases performance . etc
[02:27] <henning> eps: so all I have todo is unlocking gnome config files?
[02:27] <mneptok> IndyGUnFreak: i reinstall and just start working ;)
[02:27] <eps> henning anyway when you get a chance switch back to ubuntu, install irssi from the console, and wander back in here - and ask for help - if none of us are on insist that it wasn't recursive and you just need some help
[02:28] <Osio> Hallo
[02:28] <eps> henning not specifically, but it should be easy to fix
[02:28] <mneptok> henning: which command was it? big -R there or no?
[02:28] <ski-worklap> un_operateur1, partitioning oly increases performance if you really knkow what you are doing
[02:28] <kurei> un_operateur1, thanks again, i finally configured mustang :)
[02:28] <IndyGUnFreak> when i installed, i just did a takeover install on my hard drive, and its worked swimmingly
[02:28] <eps> if you did it in your home dir the fix is sudo chmod +r *
[02:28] <ski-worklap> un_operateur1, and if you do, you should be using multiple disks anyway
[02:28] <henning> it was small-r
[02:28] <eps> if you did it some where else it might have to be a bit more tricksy
[02:28] <eps> where did you run the command? what directory?
[02:28] <navabad> can i share my :0 screen over vnc?
[02:28] <mneptok> henning: cd / && sudo chmod +r *
[02:28] <un_operateur1> ski-worklap, thanks for that :)
[02:28] <henning> ok eps but howto install irssi?
[02:28] <eps> yes navabad, caan't remember how though :P
[02:28] <Osio> can someonehelp me with a broken xserver?
[02:29] <ski-worklap> un_operateur1, it's the truth
[02:29] <un_operateur1> ski-worklap, I didnt disagree
[02:29] <eps> mneptok not if he ran it from home...try to limit the strange ness to where he ran it from :P
[02:29] <dabaR> Osio: errors? what did you try so far?
[02:29] <henning> "sudo chmod -r *"  was run in /home/username/stuff/
[02:29] <Osio> hi
[02:29] <eps> awesome henning
[02:29] <mneptok> henning: if so, that should in no way affect your ability to login
[02:29] <Osio> after an update of the linux headers my xserver is broken
[02:29] <henning> but it did
[02:30] <eps> ish
[02:30] <Osio> it says fonts are missing
[02:30] <eps> yeah cause it doesn't cause a problem
[02:30] <mneptok> henning: then the comamnd was not run from that directory, or was not the command you said you typed.
[02:30] <dabaR> Osio: update to what? a security update in the same version?
[02:30] <henning> as the result I got the message by trying to login that ".dmrc has not 644 rights and the home folder has to be owned by this user"
[02:30] <eps> must have been +R then...but that wouldn't have done naything... chmod +R * doesn't have an action does it?
[02:30] <henning> no plus R
[02:30] <henning> anf it was small-r
[02:31] <mneptok> henning: did you just open a terminal and type that command?
[02:31] <dabaR> henning: go to console, sudo apt-get install irssi;irssi, then /server irc.freenode.net, then /j #ubuntu, you will be here.
[02:31] <Osio> yes, a securityupdate
[02:31] <henning> yes mneptok
[02:31] <torpor> is there an easy way to switch from kubuntuu to normal ubuntu?
[02:31] <mneptok> henning: then you ran it in your home dir, not in ~/stuff
[02:31] <mneptok> henning: cd ~/ && sudo chmod +r *
[02:31] <henning> could be
[02:31] <ski-worklap> torpor, yea, you should be able to just remove the kde packages and install gnome
[02:31] <Osio> i can't get the console to fix the fonts
[02:31] <eps> henning you really need to be under ubuntu for us to get a clear idea of what has gone wrong as this is a touch confusing...when you boot to ubuntu press ctrl + alt + f3 and login, then type sudo aptitude install irssi - then run it and join here again :P
[02:31] <torpor> ski-worklap: is there a simple apt-get for that?
[02:31] <henning> what is that command? mneptok "cd ~/ && sudo chmod +r *"
[02:32] <soon> I went for 15Gb for root
[02:32] <Osio> it just blinks
[02:32] <ski-worklap> torpor, probably. ubuntuforums is your friend, i'm sure someone has documented the process there
[02:32] <eps> henning it undoes what you did
[02:32] <dabaR> torpor: install ubuntu-desktop.
[02:32] <henning> aha
[02:32] <eps> it drops into your home dir and does the opposite to what you did
[02:32] <henning> ok
[02:32] <henning> I will note down howto install irssi
[02:32] <torpor> dabaR: and then i can just use ubuntu like a normal ubuntu system, with all its configuration tools and such?  like, do i have to install extra packagtes, or do i just switch to that desktop when i log in?
[02:32] <eps> kk
[02:32] <henning> then boot ubuntu
[02:33] <mneptok> henning: just note that command i gave you. you should be fine.
[02:33] <henning> execute "cd ~/ && sudo chmod +r *"
[02:33] <henning> then install irssi
[02:33] <Fleebailey33> how can i kill x?
[02:33] <henning> howto run irssi then?
[02:33] <dabaR> torpor: it will allow you to switch to that desktop, as if you installed ubuntu(you will have kde).
[02:33] <IndyGUnFreak> hey, i have another question...lol
[02:33] <eps> henning indeed, then reboot and see if it works
[02:33] <torpor> dabaR: ok thanks.
[02:33] <dabaR> henning: come on, I told you the exact command 3 times.
[02:33] <IndyGUnFreak> how do i permanently enable DMA for my DVD drive?
[02:33] <torpor> i'm doing it now, seems like it'll take a long time, but hey .. off it goes ..
[02:33] <Fleebailey33> sudo killall x****
[02:33] <Osio> STRG + ALT + BACKSPACE to kill XSERVER
[02:33] <Fleebailey33> ?
[02:33] <mneptok> henning: don't worry about irssi right now. it's corollary.
[02:33] <IndyGUnFreak> i've followed wiki instructions, but i still have ot do it everytime i insert a DVD>
[02:33] <dabaR> Fleebailey33: kill or restart?
[02:33] <Fleebailey33> kill
[02:34] <Fleebailey33> i need to install an nvidia driver
[02:34] <dabaR> Fleebailey33: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop in a console
[02:34] <Fleebailey33> or kdm
[02:34] <christopherl> how do you disable a device in Device Manager?
[02:34] <Fleebailey33> im assuming
[02:34] <dabaR> Fleebailey33: you should be fine to restart it too after installing the driver, but suit yourself.
[02:34] <dabaR> Fleebailey33: I think.
[02:34] <Fleebailey33> startx
[02:35] <henning> ok thanks for your help
[02:35] <henning> I will try that now
[02:35] <henning> hope I can join this room again then via ubuntu
[02:35] <dabaR> christopherl: no, I do not think you do. You could learn about what module is loaded for the device, maybe by googleing, and then blacklist that module

[02:40] <IndyGUnFreak> no, i added everything on that link i posted.

[02:48] <Menasim1> how can i install PHP in ubuntu??
[02:48] <IndyGUnFreak> should i turn it off then follow the instructions?
[02:48] <dabaR> !synaptic | Menasim1
[02:48] <Ubotwo> Menasim1: synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[02:48] <hjmills> Menasim1: apt-get install php
[02:49] <martin__> hellp mneptok , eps  and dabaR  its me henning, I am back on ubuntu via irssi
[02:49] <hjmills> Menasim1: * php5
[02:49] <Menasim1> thanks
[02:49] <dabaR> martin__: what is the output of "ls -ld /"? use the command inside, but not including, the quotes
[02:49] <Menasim1> Apache??
[02:49] <martin__> mneptok:  I have tried the command u have proposed "cd ~/ sudo chmod +r *" but it doesn't help to login sucessfully
[02:50] <frogzoo> IndyGUnFreak: what's wierd is, the hdparm script works from the command line but not the rc scripts... ls -l /etc/rc2.d/*hdpar*
[02:50] <dabaR> Menasim1: read how to use synaptic and do it yourself.
[02:50] <jrib> !lamp | Menasim1
[02:50] <Ubotwo> Menasim1: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[02:50] <martin__> dabaR:  do I need to leave irssi for sendung this command?
[02:50] <IndyGUnFreak> sudo hdparm /dev/hdc |grep using_dma when I run this command, it says "HDIO_GETGO failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device"
[02:50] <dabaR> martin__: not sure, does alt-ctrl-f2 take you to another console, and alt-ctrl-f1 back to irssi?
[02:51] <IndyGUnFreak> thats the whole thing I don't understand frogzoo...
[02:53] <dabaR> !test
[02:53] <Ubotwo> Failed.
[02:53] <martin__> dabaR: gy sending the command "ls -ld /" I get the result: drwxr-xr-x 21 root root 4096 2006-09-20:26 /

[02:54] <IndyGUnFreak> ok.
[02:54] <qmf> is there a swiftfox support channel?
[02:54] <IndyGUnFreak> its not that big of a deal i guess....
[02:54] <IndyGUnFreak> just don't understand why DMA isn't on by default
[02:54] <frogzoo> IndyGUnFreak: well it should be fixable
[02:54] <dabaR> martin__: what about "ls -ld /home/username" where you replace username with your ubuntu user name?
[02:55] <martin__> ok one moment
[02:55] <IndyGUnFreak> burt probably way beyond my abilities.
[02:55] <dabaR> qmf: did you ask google? maybe he knows.
[02:55] <jhasse> How can i convert a wma file to a mp3 file?
[02:55] <qmf> dabaR: i did indeed.
[02:56] <qmf> so i guess there isn't one. the forum is pretty unhelpful too.

[02:59] <qmf> but it doesn't seem to load any.
[02:59] <jhasse> rapid_: never said he ought to

[03:04] <fr500> can anyone help?
[03:04] <floris84> it's a serial touchscreen it doesn't show up
[03:05] <elwario69> hello
[03:05] <elwario69> is it possible to run emerald without beryl?
[03:05] <floris84> I can see it's output but Xorg doesn't load the driver
[03:05] <frogzoo> floris84: insmod blah.ko

[03:06] <martin__> dabaR: the problem still persists. I was able to login without error message but then no gnome desktop appears
[03:06] <haxality> I'm trying to run starcraft, and I got it installed and updated
[03:06] <haxality> but when I run it,
[03:06] <floris84> @frogzoo It's an Xorg driver not a kernel driver, does it still show up in lsmod then?
[03:06] <haxality> I get booted back to the GDM login screen
[03:06] <dabaR> martin__: and if you choose the fail-safe gnome session?
[03:06] <dabaR> martin__: this is done at the login menu bottom left
[03:07] <martin__> dabaR: u mean booting in recovery mode?
[03:07] <dabaR> no
[03:07] <floris84> since I get output from the touchscreen if I type cat /dev/ttyS3 (com port 3) I believe the serial driver is okay
[03:07] <martin__> howto choose the fail-safe gnome session?
[03:07] <hjmills> haxality: looks like its crashing X
[03:07] <dabaR> martin__: bottom left of your login screen, it is a button, then choose sessions then choose failsafe gnome
[03:08] <martin__> ok
[03:08] <martin__> I try that
[03:08] <frogzoo> floris84: not sure
[03:08] <floris84> @frogzoo do you know where to put an xorg input driver?
[03:09] <floris84> @frogzoo i've tried all of the locations but it won't load strangely enough
[03:09] <frogzoo> floris84: checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[03:10] <floris84> this is the error I keep getting in Xorg.0.log (EE) No Input driver matching 'gunze'
[03:10] <frogzoo> floris84: somewhere under /usr/lib/xorg/modules from the looks of things
[03:11] <floris84> i'm looking it up
[03:12] <floris84> hmm there's the Xfree 3.3 driver there, however I need the Xfree 4.0 driver hang on I'll give it a shot :)
[03:12] <sparr> for a complete linux newb...  6.10 or 6.06?
[03:13] <dabaR> sparr: same thing
[03:13] <hjmills> sparr: 6.06
[03:13] <martin__> dabaR: I have tried to start a fail-safe session. I got a message popup that this is a failsafe session. the rest is the same like before
[03:13] <floris84> @frogzoo nope It still keeps complaining about not finding the driver
[03:13] <frogzoo> sparr: nothing wrong with 6.10
[03:14] <frogzoo> floris84: are you sure you have a compatible driver ?
[03:14] <dabaR> martin__: /j #flood, send  "/exec -o ls -l /home/martin" as a message to the channel.
[03:14] <sparr> how long is support for 6.10 supposed to last?  patches, updates, etc
[03:14] <floris84> frogzoo: well, it's compiled for xfree could the error be that i'm running Xorg?
[03:15] <dabaR> !releases | sparr
[03:15] <Ubotwo> sparr: Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 18 months to 5 years. More info at http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
[03:15] <dabaR> read the first link for more info.
[03:16] <Rookie_> new name on the bot ?
[03:16] <CSWookie> How do I use a different window manager?  I apt-getted it, but it doesn't show up in the sessions chooser when I log in.
[03:16] <sparr> so 6.10 will be supported for 18 months and 6.06 for 5 years?  from release
[03:16] <dabaR> CSWookie: which one is it?
[03:16] <dabaR> sparr: yes
[03:16] <CSWookie> dabaR: ratpoison
[03:16] <frogzoo> floris84: more than likely
[03:16] <Rookie_> !nvidia
[03:16] <Ubotwo> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:17] <sparr> hmm...  tough call.  some people im giving CDs to would probably still be using it 2+ years from now
[03:17] <floris84> @frogzoo well maybe I need to compile it for xorg then
[03:17] <floris84> frogzoo: I'll look into compiling xorg thanks for the help!
[03:18] <sparr> where can i find official(?) [k] ubuntu cd label artwork?
[03:18] <CSWookie> Anyway, if I knew what file to edit to give me the choice, I'd edit it.  Or the GUI thing to use to edit the choice.
[03:18] <hemanth> what player can i install in ubuntu to play most of the movie formats??
[03:19] <CSWookie> But GNOME is about 10 times cleverer than I am.
[03:19] <frogzoo> CSWookie: sys -> admin -> login
[03:19] <sparr> hemanth: mplayer
[03:19] <sparr> hemanth: if mplayer cant play it, its broken.

[03:31] <torpor> okay i successfully switched back to ubuntu-gnome, but now i get a ton of bug-buddy windows whenever i log in .. though it 'seems' that my desktop recovers and i get nautilus et al. all working again, but i sure would like to fix those bug buddy crashes .. unfortunately they all disappear before i can note any details - so is there any advice for what to do about these crashes when i log in?  maybe i should create a new user id or something?
[03:31] <dabaR> hemanth: also, paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to paste.ubuntu-nl.org, and show me output of cat /etc/issue
[03:32] <dabaR> torpor: what do the crashes refer to?  You could remove the bug-buddy notices, let me find out how...
[03:32] <torpor> dabaR: it seems like they refer to panel apps like for wireless, etc. but i can't see the details in time to confirm this ...
[03:34] <dabaR> torpor: not sure myself what to do about it... I found bug-buddy --sm-disable
[03:34] <torpor> dabaR: okay now they've gone away, darn.. was hoping i could get the details.  perhaps it was theme related because all i did was switch themes.
[03:34] <frogzoo> trope: maybe mv ~/.kde ~/.kde.x
[03:34] <torpor> but my wireless is still not working.

[03:54] <Fujoor> hey guys a little simple question, how much space would an ubuntu server install take?
[03:54] <ady> Furjoor, depends on the addons u are installing
[03:54] <frogzoo> Fujoor: 10 gigs will do it easy - but you need space for www/sql
[03:55] <Fujoor> ah, but around 10 gig? but if you just need it for apache,ftp,rtorrent and irssi ... isnt there any way to make it smaller?
[03:55] <frogzoo> Fujoor: sure, probly could fit that in 500meg
[03:55] <ady> yeah, pick what u want and install it all manually
[03:56] <jbroome> Fujoor: the base install is like 5-600 mb
[03:56] <cursor> dabaR : you trying to help me with the ndiswrapper problem?
[03:56] <Denyerec> Hey chaps, the version of PHP5 on the dotdeb repo is 5.2 but this breaks a lot of apps... which repo can I use to install 5.14 ?
[03:56] <Fujoor> ady: i dont think im htat good with linux to know what i need and dont need
[03:56] <dabaR> cursor: I just noticed you said the instructions on the site, which begs the question which instructions, which site
[03:57] <neuro_> Fujoor: if you just want a web server, pick the Install LAMP Server option when you boot from the CD
[03:57] <neuro_> it takes up about 600 meg
[03:57] <r4wbeRRy> cu, thanks for helping :)
[03:57] <cursor> the instructions on the home site for ndiswrapper
[03:57] <neuro_> not counting your data, natch :)
[03:57] <Fujoor> neuro_: the lamp was what i had in mind, thank you ... ill check it out
[03:57] <Fujoor> neuro_: 600 mb sounds better than 10 gigs ;)
[03:57] <neuro_> yup :)

[03:58] <dabaR> Jussi01: killall gnome-panel
[03:58] <Fujoor> would it run fine with 64 mbs of ram without gui (x?)
[03:58] <cursor> ive tried no luch
[03:58] <cursor> luck
[03:58] <cursor> is there a remote assistance option in ubuntu?
[03:58] <neuro_> Fujoor: 64MB ram might be cutting it a bit fine in terms of performance
[03:58] <Fujoor> textmode only
[03:59] <neuro_> but it installs in text mode only by default; no X components are installed
[03:59] <Fujoor> neuro_: hmm so 64 would be slow, and im not too good with optimizing linux
[04:00] <Fujoor> anyway, thank you, ill read into it
[04:00] <neuro_> RAM is cheap tho
[04:00] <dabaR> Fujoor: it should be fine for command line, afaik.
[04:00] <neuro_> depends on what you want to do with it really
[04:00] <Quinn_Storm> hey guys, just wondering...where should I go for support on an obnoxious issue...specifically, I have a machine that I have to boot noapic to get running (nForce 430 chipset, google suggests this is the culprit), and it causes lots of issues.  Specifically, it slows the machine down greatly over time as interrupt storms build, and it still locks up sometimes
[04:00] <neuro_> 64 meg is fine if it's going to do nothing all day
[04:00] <Fujoor> i just have some computers over, i thought i could do something useful with them
[04:00] <cursor> who wants to help me solve my ndiswrapper problem with remote assistance
[04:00] <neuro_> if it's going to serve many websites and databases, 64 meg is useless
[04:00] <dabaR> Fujoor: try it out, should work great, I think.
[04:00] <neuro_> there are varying shades of grey/usefulness inbetween :)

[04:27] <Ubotwo> [BTF] Chm0d: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:27] <_raphael_> dabaR: think that`s what I need. thank you
[04:28] <sedra> can i use RPM in ubuntu?
[04:28] <sedra> SUSE RPM
[04:28] <dabaR> sedra: you should not if possible to avoid.
[04:28] <apokryphos> sedra: no; why do you think you need to?
[04:28] <sedra> i installed openSUSE and now i want to switch to ubuntu
[04:29] <jbroome> i don't blame you
[04:29] <apokryphos> sedra: so download the ISO and install it
[04:29] <Zubzodak> Doesn't Alien allow you to install most other packages? but ya, i think it is a little fudgy ...
[04:29] <dabaR> sedra: if you are asking whether you can use a .rpm package for a program...
[04:29] <dabaR> jbroome: haha
[04:29] <fr500> hello
[04:29] <dabaR> Zubzodak: no need to use it in 99.9% of cases, I think.

[04:31] <Ubotwo> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[04:31] <sedra> linDVD like in mandriva
[04:31] <gcG> hey guys, i'm new to this linx world.. so, whats the diff. between ubuntu and kubuntu?
[04:31] <sedra> legally!!
[04:32] <dabaR> gcG: the desktop looks different and they use different applications.
[04:32] <apokryphos> gcG: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[04:32] <stoorty> kubuntu is kde
[04:32] <sedra> gcG; huh.
[04:32] <Gosha|Away> .. trying to install WineXCVS .. but wheni sh the the .sh file it goes :

[04:32] <Gosha|Away> WineCVS.sh: 48: Syntax error: "(" unexpected

[04:32] <sedra> lol
[04:32] <bipolar> did ubuntu recently rename all the xorg packages?
[04:32] <malt> www.m4lt.com/vsftpd.conf there is my vsftpd.conf for vsftpd ftp server, is there any setting in there that will make a user stick with there home user directory instead of being able to browse around other directorys
[04:32] <sedra> why changing the name
[04:32] <dabaR> Gosha|Away: does the first line of the file say #! /bin/sh?
[04:32] <gcG> k. thanks u all :P
[04:32] <sedra> it's ubuntu too
[04:33] <Gosha|Away> "#!/bin/bash"
[04:33] <dabaR> sedra: so we know which one we are installing?
[04:33] <Gosha|Away> .. should i do bash?
[04:33] <Gosha|Away> instead of sh
[04:33] <sedra> no i use openSUSE

[04:33] <Crescendo_> Is there a script of some sort to get 3d compositing working, or do we call that Feisty Fawn?
[04:33] <Zubzodak> Umm.. someone please point me toward documentation on installing Edgy on an external USB Drive .. ?
[04:34] <Gosha> should i do "bash <filename>.sh" ?
[04:34] <gcG> so, if there is not any distribution packages of Amarok for Ubuntu i'll have to compile it myself?
[04:34] <reverseblade> Crescendo, I doubt that there will be any in the future

[04:34] <sedra> is there Realplayer in ubuntu???
[04:35] <Crescendo_> dabaR, yes, I know all of that.
[04:35] <sedra> the real realplayer
[04:35] <Gosha> ... eh, wtf
[04:35] <Crescendo_> I've got it all working on my machine, my question is if there'll be something that'll make it work much easier, or perhaps from default in a future version.
[04:36] <Gosha> well doing "bash ..sh" worked at least ..

[04:37] <Crescendo_> Ugh, after I upgraded to Edgy, all links in Xchat open with "mozilla" instead of "firefox" - why?

[04:39] <Gosha> ... su / sudo .. what is the difference?
[04:39] <jrib> !sudo | Gosha
[04:39] <Ubotwo> Gosha: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:39] <dabaR> Crescendo_: check the preferred app thing in system>prefs, or is it in admin...
[04:40] <sedra> and su??
[04:40] <Crescendo_> dabaR, it is preferences
[04:40] <sedra> !su
[04:40] <Ubotwo> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:40] <Crescendo_> And yes, it is correct
[04:40] <dabaR> Crescendo_: ya, that makes sense
[04:40] <jrib> Gosha, sedra: the wiki page should answer your questions.  If after reading it, something still isn't clear just ask
[04:40] <dabaR> Crescendo_: you sure? try giving it a custom command
[04:41] <sedra> ok thnx
[04:41] <Crescendo_> dabaR, positive
[04:41] <rausb0> is there a channel for udev related questions?
[04:41] <dabaR> Crescendo_: does xchat have something in its prefs about it?

[04:42] <digin4> hi i want to compile something that needs kernel build files in /lib/modules/2.6.15-26-amd64-generic/build, how can i get that?
[04:42] <Crescendo_> dabaR, yes, in a way - it's named "URL Handlers" - and the only entry, it appears by default, is "Open Link in Opera" - I think that's a right click option somewhere.
[04:42] <gcG> is there a way of reducing the BW that apt-get will use?
[04:43] <[BTF] Chm0d> frogzoo: that was my real question i thought it was pretty straight forward.  I simply asked if anyone/anybody has an ipaq working in ubuntu?
[04:43] <brucedes> does ubuntu support the netgear WG111T USB Dongle natively?
[04:44] <sedra> how do u think ubuntu vs openSUSE
[04:44] <dabaR> sedra: for sure, we like suse better, but still hang out in #ubuntu

[04:47] <Gosha> i've used sudo -i so far :P
[04:47] <Gosha> okay
[04:47] <Chousuke> Gosha: because ubuntu uses sudo for root access. :)

[05:05] <kristopher> is ndiswrapper configured into the kernel? (not getting anything with lsmod) and is there a config direcotory.

[05:08] <tonyyarusso> malt: I never run it that way though - I always use the init script
[05:08] <dabaR> _gcG_: Places>connect to server
[05:08] <nuked_omen> ubuntu is very unfriendly for offline users
[05:08] <jbroome> most things are
[05:08] <skelter> hey - whenever i launch an SDL app, X crashes. Anyone think they can give me a pointer here? I think it might have to do with my video drivers (nvidia)
[05:08] <dabaR> nuked_omen: an excellent intro
[05:08] <clemyeats> kristopher: what do you mean? does the card work fine in Ubuntu ?
[05:08] <nuked_omen> i installed it at work and i couldn't do a thing
[05:09] <Invisible_> Hi, i want to download ubuntu server edition? which link should i follow ? desktop ?
[05:09] <malt> tonyyarusso: whats default path for the config
[05:09] <nuked_omen> cuz i need all the programs i install with synaptic
[05:09] <nuked_omen> and i have to be online to do that
[05:09] <dabaR> Invisible_: 6.06 or 6.10?
[05:09] <nuked_omen> dabaR, thank you
[05:09] <Invisible_> 6.10
[05:09] <_gcG_> dabaR,  o.O thanks
[05:09] <tonyyarusso> malt: /etc/vsftpd.conf of course - why?
[05:10] <dabaR> Invisible_: torrent?
[05:10] <extern> why can't my windows computer ping ubuntu copmuter? the ubuntu computer can ping windows one
[05:10] <kristopher> yup, the card works very well.  But there's no ndiswrapper in lsmod.. and nothing i see that relaly could be the module for it other than "nfnetlink" which i dont know what that does.
[05:10] <Invisible_> dabaR> http link ?
[05:10] <tonyyarusso> Invisible_: http://releases.ubuntu.com/edgy/ should do it.
[05:10] <kristopher> thats why i asked whether or not it was in the kernel.
[05:10] <malt> tonyyarusso: i did nothing to the ftp but try a setting, and i removed that setting and uploaded the config back, and now ftp server will not start
[05:10] <clemyeats> kristopher: then there's a driver other than ndiswrapper's that's making your card work.
[05:11] <Hoag> Does anyone know any decent gDesklet archives? Looking for a bigger RSS grabber, but I can't find them.
[05:11] <Invisible_> it says : server. It will not install a graphical user interface.
[05:11] <clemyeats> kristopher: if that doesn't work out of the box in your other distro you can try ndiswrapper in it.
[05:11] <kristopher> could the usbcore possibly hold it?
[05:12] <clemyeats> I don't really know.. it could be anything.
[05:12] <Invisible_> but i can install graphical drivers after i finish installtion ryt?
[05:12] <nuked_omen> i have to go through dependency hell to install anything offline
[05:12] <malt> anyone here use vsftpd, and have it setup where it reads by linux user accounts?
[05:12] <kristopher> thanks - this is just a pain in the butt because theres no reason it shouldn't be using ndiswrapper.
[05:13] <clemyeats> kristopher: well if it works without it then... why use ndiswrapper..
[05:13] <zeroGraph> malt: yes, it's a pretty easy section in the config for it
[05:13] <extern> where's ubotu?
[05:13] <zeroGraph> !ask
[05:13] <Ubotwo> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:13] <zeroGraph> He's gone :O
[05:14] <extern> is this a new version of it or something?
[05:14] <GreyGhost> !ubotu
[05:14] <Ubotwo> This is a temporary Ubotu replacement. Please don't abuse it.
[05:14] <nuked_omen> he found better things to do probably
[05:14] <kristopher> clemyeats, absolutely.  I just have no clue why it would work without it, and if its working without it i need to figure out why
[05:14] <zeroGraph> RIP: ubotu
[05:14] <malt> zeroGraph what looks wrong with this config www.m4lt.com/vsftpd.conf
[05:14] <GreyGhost> zeroGraph ,temp ;)
[05:14] <kristopher> so asking if it was possibly in the kernel, or hidden somewhere eliminated one step
[05:14] <zeroGraph> Thank god :)

[05:17] <Invisible_> tonyyarusso> any help ? if i install server edition i will not graphical, but i can install GUI after i finish isntalltion ryt?
[05:17] <WaHL> gr?
[05:18] <WaHL> ahhh lol, ty m8
[05:18] <jbroome> Invisible_: yes.  sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop
[05:18] <zeroGraph> WaHL; swedish keyboard right? It should have a "alt gr" key near the right CTRL key
[05:18] <tonyyarusso> Invisible_: If you wish, yes.  (apart from the calls of "heretic!  burn him!" from the crowds :P )
[05:18] <GreyGhost> am i the only one to think that gnome is better than KDE due to its clean look or can
[05:19] <nevron> bash: glinfo: command not found
[05:19] <GreyGhost>  KDE be set up so?
[05:19] <nevron> greyghost i dont have direct rendering
[05:19] <zeroGraph> GreyGhost: I like Gnome better than KDE, much cleaner and blah blah, so no you're not alone :)
[05:19] <tonyyarusso> Invisible_, zeroGraph: ubuntu-desktop, not gnome-desktop, although something far more minimal would be preferable.
[05:19] <kristopher> clemyeats, thanks - found it at76c503.
[05:19] <GreyGhost> nevron ,sorry i typed it wron ... it should be glxinfo :(
[05:19] <nevron> it s ok

[05:37] <nevron> phonox are you using ati
[05:37] <fleebailey33> will reinstalling grub mess up windows installition?
[05:37] <Denyerec> if I do this on breezy: gksu "update-manager -c"
[05:37] <Denyerec> what will die ?
[05:37] <phonox> nevron: no prob; i use ati, but radeon driver.
[05:38] <extern> am I invisible? :/
[05:38] <phonox> nevron: never installed any ati catalyst drivdr
[05:38] <nevron> did you install fglrx before or is fglrx xorg driver installed?
[05:38] <nevron> can you check to see
[05:38] <Invisible_> extern> u are not but i am :)
[05:38] <phonox> nevron: i am using aiglrx with radeon driver
[05:38] <Gosha> eh, well my processor is an "AMD Athlon XP 2600+" .. which one would it be on "http://packages.debian.org/stable/x11/x-window-system-dev" ?
[05:38] <extern> lol
[05:39] <nevron> ok phonox again do you have fglrx xorg driver under synaptic and is it installed by default
[05:39] <phonox> oh, maybe i misuderstood your question
[05:39] <phonox> lets see
[05:39] <nevron> thanx phonox
[05:40] <Dybber> I have a problem with fonts in edgy, i cant see bitstream vera and others in xfontsel and gtkfontsel. But they show up in OpenOffice, Abiword and in nautilus (fonts://). I get this error in the terminal when launching xfontsel: "Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion  Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset"
[05:40] <phonox> nevron: it is in linux-restricted-modules.
[05:41] <nevron> ok but is it installed?
[05:41] <nevron> is it marked as installed?
[05:41] <phonox> nevron: no
[05:41] <Dybber> I wont to use the bitstream vera mono font in emacs, but all characters is squares when i try.
[05:41] <nevron> damn i am in trouble now :)
[05:41] <phonox> why
[05:41] <phonox> what are you going to do?
[05:42] <nevron> because if i uninstall fglrx xorg drivers my glxinfo reports errors and nothing else
[05:42] <phonox> not even "dynamic rendering: No"?
[05:42] <nevron> and i try to reinstall the lib s you just told me the default ones
[05:42] <Gosha> AMD Athlon XP 2600+ != AMD64, right?
[05:42] <nevron> but i cant install them when fglrx xorg drivers are not installed
[05:43] <phonox> hmm.
[05:43] <nevron> now i am stuck with the fglrx libs so radeon driver cannot work because they are using the wrong libGL.so.1
[05:44] <phonox> it is no problem to install fglrx xorg drivers. you dont need to load them
[05:44] <nevron> ok but they change the default libs
[05:44] <phonox> are you going to switch back to some "basic" config?
[05:44] <nevron> no phonox i am trying to configure aiglx but i cant get my direct rendering to work
[05:44] <ktstzo> hello gentlemas, can any one give me a hand configuring a network printer?
[05:45] <phonox> ok. let me think a moment. i think i can help you
[05:45] <nevron> thank you phonox
[05:45] <phonox> have you completely uninstalled your ati drivers?
[05:46] <nevron> hmm i am using ubuntu 6.10 i did not even install them because 6.10 claims that it already has the drivers installed
[05:46] <phonox> fine.
[05:46] <nevron> the radeon open source ones
[05:46] <ktstzo> hello gentlemas, can any one give me a hand configuring a network printer?
[05:47] <phonox> ok..
[05:47] <nevron> so i just edited the xorg to use radeon drivers
[05:47] <phonox> how bad does the output of glxinfo look? is it broken?

[05:50] <phonox> you can always boot your ubuntu-live-cd and you will experience aiglx and radeon opensource driver - performance
[05:50] <phonox> your direct rendering will be enabled
[05:50] <computermc> Awaydee_: I wanted to install apache by source, so I thought you had to install php by source too to get it to work
[05:50] <rapid> or you could just change the driver in xorg.conf to radeon couldn't yoiu
[05:50] <nevron> hmm without any configuration?

[05:52] <Denyerec> y
[05:52] <skunkworks> I have a buffalo wli-cb-g54s wireless card.  I was wondering if there was a good source of info on getting it working on dapper.  (linux newbie)
[05:52] <fleebailey33> man ndswrapper
[05:52] <Gosha> Wee~ some swedish guide helped~
[05:52] <phonox> i don't know.
[05:52] <phonox> are you using two monitors?
[05:52] <lynucs> yeah, edgy destructs my mnu.lst every time i update the kernel :D
[05:53] <skunkworks> fleebailey33: thanks
[05:53] <lynucs> and on upgrade from dapper
[05:53] <nevron> yes i have a dual head setup with mergedfb
[05:53] <nevron> and i think that mergedfb suports direct rendering with radeon
[05:53] <Valmarko> I just installed compiz but how dont know how to run the window manager
[05:53] <fleebailey33> skunkworks, im new to linux as well. but i help when i know somethingh
[05:53] <phonox> hmm. sorry. i don't know much about it.
[05:53] <mamzers555> hello, i get a problem while compiling network-manager. i get this error:
[05:53] <mamzers555> ./gnome/libnm_glib/.libs/libnm_glib.so: undefined reference to `dbus_connection_disconnect'
[05:54] <mamzers555> can somebody help me please fixing this?
[05:54] <lynucs> valmarko, cant you choose how to start a session as the login screen appers?
[05:54] <phonox> but the live-cd-version should be a good start to enable mergedfb again   .. :)
[05:54] <edgarin> Hi to all people howto i can install dvddirgen program?
[05:54] <edgarin> in the packages not found
[05:54] <Awaydee_> computermc: i don't know which exact header files you need (your PHP README probably contains this information), so you might want to search synaptic for "dev" packages for mysql.
[05:54] <Valmarko> lynucs, tanks
[05:54] <Denyerec> How / where can I get PHP 5.1 froim a repo?
[05:55] <computermc> Awaydee_: ok thanks
[05:55] <Denyerec> In Breezy it lists only 5.2 and 5.0.5
[05:55] <nevron> ok i ll try asking it
[05:55] <phonox> the mergedfb-sections should be independant of your old fglrx config.
[05:56] <phonox> have you seen the "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" trick?
[05:56] <malt> what could cause "500 OOPS: bad bool value in config file for: listen" in vsftpd on startup
[05:56] <nevron> they are actually independent
[05:56] <nevron> i am guessing i have some wrong symbolic links
[05:57] <phonox> hmm
[05:57] <ajantaju> so now i just don't understand this broadcom wlan
[05:57] <ajantaju> it's eth1
[05:57] <nevron> so even if i reinstall lib gl's for mesa it uses the old ones
[05:57] <ajantaju> anybody played with these? "Broadcom 4306"
[05:57] <rapid> ajantaju, eth1 is fine.
[05:58] <nevron> and if i remove them than glxinfo spits out errors only
[05:58] <phonox> what do you mean with "old ones"
[05:58] <TimothyP> Does ubuntu only support 3 drives for a raid configuration ??? I have 2 times 4 drives on 2 seperate SATA controllers (each with 4 ports) , I want to configure the 4 drives on the second controller as RAID 0 but I can only selecgt 3 devices even though as created 4 partitions as RAID . Even more when I select them first 3 for the raid 0 it just keeps doing it but doesn't really do anything
[05:59] <TimothyP> I just need to create one big hard drive to store data recorded by mythtv on there
[05:59] <jbroome> TimothyP: look at lvm
[05:59] <nolimitsoya> !lvm | TimothyP
[05:59] <Ubotwo> TimothyP: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[05:59] <TimothyP> LVM is not supported by the intstaller :(
[05:59] <mattybats> what's up yo
[05:59] <jbroome> use the alt installer
[05:59] <mattybats> ?
[05:59] <TimothyP> 1) it's in the menu system but says kernel doesn't support it
[06:00] <TimothyP> am using server installer
[06:00] <TimothyP> and alternate
[06:00] <TimothyP> tried both
[06:00] <mattybats> anybody here set up ubuntu repositories before?
[06:00] <TimothyP> and it doesn't make sense it doesn't support more than 3 raid drives
[06:00] <jbroome> then i'll telly my edgy fileserver that lvm doesn't work on it
[06:00] <TimothyP> why do they put LVM in the installer if it's not supported by the kernel?
[06:00] <nolimitsoya> TimothyP, it is
[06:00] <computermc> Awaydee_: I got the mysql-headers working!
[06:00] <TimothyP> ok han gon I'll do it again and tell you the error message :)
[06:01] <nevron> phonox i mean the default files
[06:01] <Awaydee_> computermc: congrats :)
[06:01] <TimothyP> so I take the four last drives, I create a partition on each of them and format as LVM
[06:01] <mattybats> why do i get no love?
[06:01] <nevron> phonox can you paste bin your glxinfo output
[06:01] <computermc> Awaydee_: Its so nice to be able to chat with someone that has ideas of what to try, the spirit of opensource
[06:02] <TimothyP> no-g I get a menu item "Configure the local volume manager"
[06:02] <TimothyP> get a menu asking me to apply changes
[06:02] <TimothyP> and then :)
[06:02] <TheGateKeeper> mattybats, using edgy or dapper?
[06:02] <edgarin> hey people howto i can install de program dvddirgen?????
[06:02] <mattybats> edgy
[06:02] <eSa|> hi, what pprog do you suggest to convert a dvd to divx?
[06:02] <TimothyP> The  current kernel doesn't support the Logical Volume Manager, You may need to load the lvm-mod module
[06:02] <TimothyP> with a nice red background
[06:02] <TimothyP> :)
[06:02] <Gosha> Whatthe!
[06:02] <Gosha> Fail.
[06:02] <nolimitsoya> edgarin, is it in the repos?
[06:02] <TimothyP> tried both the alternate and server cd
[06:03] <Awaydee_> computermc: hehe, sure. open source, free love, neighbourly assistance, etc... all the same ;)
[06:03] <TimothyP> 6.10
[06:03] <edgarin> nolimitsoya, nop
[06:03] <mattybats> from the apt-mirror site "It never makes inconsistent mirror including while mirroring"
[06:03] <mattybats> bs
[06:03] <nolimitsoya> TimothyP, you are either doing something wrong, or youve hit som sort of bug. read the lvm docs and file a bugreport. (in that order)
[06:03] <edgarin> in the repos not aren't :(
[06:03] <TheGateKeeper> mattybats, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_add_extra_repositories
[06:03] <nolimitsoya> edgarin, then youll have to either find a deb or compile it for your self

[06:04] <jrib> !version | WizCraker
[06:04] <Ubotwo> WizCraker: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[06:04] <phonox> nevron: maybe you have set aiglx to off when you were doing changes to it in some fglrx configuration tutorial...
[06:04] <mattybats> TheGateKeeper: dude, i'm not trying to edit my sources.list file, i'm trying to set up a mirror
[06:04] <nevron> do you mean in my xorg.conf
[06:04] <edgarin> but, where is the url of this package in google not have the URL of this program
[06:04] <Gosha> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37785/ <-- Wee~
[06:04] <TimothyP> waw those docs are really encouraging :p
[06:04] <TheGateKeeper> mattybats, :-)

[06:05] <TheGateKeeper> mattybats, nope
[06:06] <Denyerec> I am too scared to update to edgy
[06:06] <Denyerec> so how do I install PHP5.1 ?
[06:06] <Denyerec> Given that it doesn't appear to exist in any Ubuntu repository
[06:07] <apokryphos> then you have to compile
[06:07] <Denyerec> There's about 20 packages.
[06:07] <Denyerec> php5-common php5 php5-pear etc.
[06:07] <mattybats> computers scare me
[06:07] <Denyerec> Then there's an apache lib also
[06:07] <Denyerec> I have to compile all these?
[06:07] <mattybats> i've had my heart broken by an edgy repository :[
[06:07] <fleebailey33> google
[06:08] <apokryphos> if you haven't compiled php before doing it and setting it up might not be the easiest thing
[06:08] <fleebailey33> php5 x86 download
[06:08] <Denyerec> I've had my heart broken by Synaptic not working.
[06:08] <phonox> nevron: have you installed xserver-xorg-video-ati package?
[06:08] <apokryphos> !doesn'twork
[06:08] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[06:08] <Denyerec> And being terrified of updating from Breezy to Edgy.
[06:08] <apokryphos> !doesn't work
[06:08] <Ubotwo> Please elaborate, your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you. Please give more detailed information, errors, steps, and possibly configuration files (use the !pastebin to avoid flooding the channel)
[06:09] <mattybats> Denyerec: why are you using synaptic?
[06:09] <apokryphos> Denyerec: you would need to breezy -> dapper -> edgy
[06:09] <nevron> yes it is installed
[06:09] <Denyerec> Because if I load the console
[06:09] <Denyerec> I break things
[06:09] <mattybats> Denyerec: how so?
[06:09] <malt> 500 OOPS: bad bool value in config file for: listen, what could be making vsftpd get that error ;/
[06:09] <Denyerec> Computers hate me, I hate computers.
[06:09] <Denyerec> If I try and do anything, it breaks.
[06:09] <mattybats> me to
[06:09] <Denyerec> Right now, I have 5.0.5 installed
[06:09] <Denyerec> and the CRM I need Segfaults on it.
[06:09] <Denyerec> So I need to install PHP 5.1
[06:10] <mattybats> Denyerec: the nature of computers is malfunction
[06:10] <Denyerec> but the only one I can see in the repository is 5.2
[06:10] <Denyerec> So I either need to find a repository that has 5.1
[06:10] <Denyerec> or... I don't know.
[06:10] <Denyerec> Compiling it, I know, won't work.
[06:11] <ajantaju> so how do i resize a partition for installing windowz to my laptop?
[06:11] <Denyerec> I don't even know if 5,1 is in the Edgy repository
[06:11] <Gosha> " TIP: look, behind you! " <-- Scary
[06:11] <apokryphos> !packages
[06:11] <Ubotwo> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[06:11] <apokryphos> Denyerec: check there
[06:12] <pike_> malt: i would think the listen no/yes line in /etc/vsftpd.conf is wrong. normally you can just comment this out
[06:12] <Gosha> ... what are those warty and ho- oh, FAQ
[06:12] <Denyerec> Ok so dapper has it.
[06:12] <phonox> nevron: if you uninstall xorg-driver-fglrx, glxinfo does not work?
[06:12] <Denyerec> can I add a dapper repo and install from there perhaps ?
[06:12] <nothlit> Can someone using edgy paste me the contents of the command ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/info/wireless-tools.list
[06:12] <Gosha> edgy = 6.10 ?
[06:12] <fleebailey33> Gosha, yes
[06:12] <Gosha> ah, i see
[06:12] <_JP> why is there no valgrind-callgrind package for edgy? for dapper there seems to be..
[06:12] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, what version are you running?
[06:13] <ADD>  Does anyone know how to transfer outlook contacts to Evolution mail?
[06:13] <Denyerec> 5.0.5
[06:13] <Denyerec> Breezy
[06:13] <Denyerec> php 5.05
[06:13] <nevron> yes
[06:13] <pike_> malt: youre starting from init script like "sudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart" ?
[06:13] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, not supported. upgrade
[06:13] <Denyerec> If I upgrade
[06:13] <Denyerec> I know my box will die
[06:13] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, and why is that?
[06:13] <Denyerec> Because I'm doing it.
[06:13] <ADD> please?
[06:13] <cloakable> !server
[06:13] <Ubotwo> Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current stable version is 6.06 LTS. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/
[06:14] <Denyerec> If I update to Dapper I just know there will be smoke, flames, tears and then a LOT of pain.
[06:14] <WizCraker> so I had php4 running with php5 so I removed 4 and now php doesn't work in apache2.  I've made sure the Apache-PHP5 module was loaded and enabled but can't get php5 to work again.  Any ideas how to resolve?
[06:14] <ADD> Can someone help me transfer Outlook contacts to Evolution?

[06:15] <nevron> phobox this is what happens when i uninstall fglrx xorg
[06:15] <thunder_storm> i have a big problem: if i start apt-get, i got an Segmentation fault - what is that?
[06:15] <Denyerec> Make a tar of the entire machine?
[06:15] <Gosha> WizCraker -> wouldn't it be better if you deleted everything and then just installed what you want? >_<
[06:15] <nolimitsoya> thunder_storm, major breakage :)
[06:15] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, yes. tar /, and just format and unzip if things fail
[06:15] <thunder_storm> nolimitsoya: can i fix that?
[06:16] <Denyerec> That actually works?
[06:16] <Denyerec> Heh
[06:16] <nolimitsoya> thunder_storm, i have no idea. :) perhaps you can.
[06:16] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, yes
[06:16] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, this is not windows ;)
[06:16] <TheGateKeeper> Denyerec, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=81311&highlight=HOWTO%3A+backup
[06:16] <Denyerec> What about all the disk formatting stuff and such
[06:16] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, what about it?
[06:17] <shadowhywind> hay all, i hate asking easy questions, But if i wanted to add a harddrive to mount on boot, I would add that to fstab correct?
[06:17] <zeroGraph> yes
[06:17] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, 'cd / && sudo tar -cvpzf backup.tgz --one-file-system --exclude=/backup.tgz /' will give you a full backup of your root
[06:17] <jrib> shadowhywind: yep
[06:17] <xu_zhu> hey guys, im not sure if people who were around last night helping me are around now, but im a newbie trying to set up my wireless connection.  With much wrangling and reading, i got it to work using ndiswrapper.  unfortunately, the signal strength is terrible, while it was fine in xp.  so im trying to troubleshoot that by connecting a card i know is solid.  my question is, how do i tell linux to use one card for wlan0 and another for wlan
[06:17] <Denyerec> Yeah I am reading the site now.
[06:17] <xu_zhu> in xp, i would just create two different network connections and enable / disable as needed
[06:17] <thunder_storm> nolimitsoya: thank you
[06:17] <xu_zhu> but im not sure how to do this in linux.
[06:18] <Denyerec> I love the way he states to recreate the dirs you excluded   and causally throws "etc...." in there
[06:18] <pike_> xu_zhu: sudo gedit /etc/iftab
[06:18] <shadowhywind> also what options would I add. i have /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 vfat (would it be) defauls, umask=000  0   0   ??
[06:18] <xStream> hi. how can i run more than one totem instance?
[06:18] <nolimitsoya> thunder_storm, if you explain the problem and background perhaps someone can give you more usefull info :)
[06:18] <nevron> any suggestions phobox
[06:18] <jdavidboyd> Good morning!  I'm trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on a friend
[06:18] <nothlit> shadowhywind, yes, and you probably need to use the option default or auto
[06:18] <fleebailey33> how can i do an fsck check fix at bootup through grub?
[06:18] <phonox> nevron: maybe  sudo strace glxinfo 2>&1 | grep open
[06:18] <apokryphos> jdavidboyd: that's mean
[06:18] <pike_> xu_zhu: youll notice the mac address of network cards there and the device name
[06:18] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, just use my command and you can dissregard all that
[06:18] <apokryphos> jdavidboyd: your friend is already human, presumably
[06:18] <nothlit> !fsck | fleebailey33
[06:18] <Ubotwo> fleebailey33: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[06:18] <shadowhywind> nothlit where would i add that ?
[06:19] <jdavidboyd> apokryphos: yeah, a little...
[06:19] <nothlit> shadowhywind, in the options column of fstab :)
[06:19] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, the guide has severalproblems and dumb solutions for imaginary problems
[06:19] <FifaFrazer> I have a configure script here, that says that gtk+-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path. But synaptic package manager tells me that it is already installed.. How can i fix this?

[06:19] <dfcarney> !samba > dfcarney
[06:19] <fleebailey33> and it freezes when checking file systems
[06:19] <xu_zhu> Pichu0102: totally! thanks so much.

[06:19] <nevron> what am i looking for phobox?
[06:19] <fleebailey33> i think mine is corrupted
=== lynucs is now known as lynucs|afk
[06:19] <shadowhywind> ok thanks
[06:19] <nothlit> fleebailey33, why don't you use your livecd and fsck it
[06:19] <xu_zhu> but thanks all the same.  how do you guys learn all this stuff?
[06:19] <jdavidboyd> i'm trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on a friend's computer, off of the CD, and everytime it gets to 59% installed, it hangs.  Is there someway anyone knows of to get some status informatio on what is happening while the install is going on, so I can find out what is wrong?

[06:20] <Denyerec> nolimit what about the proc and sys dirs ?
[06:20] <fleebailey33> so i asked if there was a way for grub to command
[06:20] <phonox> you see the libs being opened.
[06:20] <Denyerec> I presume your command excludes those?
[06:20] <fleebailey33> see?

[06:23] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, just realize that this command only packups one fs/partition, so if you plan on whiping out several partitions youll have to back them up separately
[06:23] <Denyerec> I think I only have one
[06:24] <Denyerec> well no
[06:24] <Denyerec> I have /boot/
[06:24] <Denyerec> and something else
[06:24] <phonox> be sure to "sudo apt-get --purge remove xorg-driver-fglrx linux-restricted-modules-386 linux-restricted-modules-generic"
[06:24] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, it always a good idea to have a separate /home. if you dont, be aware that unziping that backup will roll back any updated files in your /home.
[06:25] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, id suggest reinstalling dapper, clean, with a new partitioning scheme
[06:25] <xu_zhu> pike_: could you help me out with one more thing?  (a newbie question, i know), but how do i get the MAC address of my ndiswrapper-driven USB wireless device?  the driver is installed and working, and my changes to iftab are having effect, now i just need to figure out which MAC to put in there.
[06:25] <nevron> phonox ok i did it
[06:25] <Denyerec> nolimitsoya - not an option
[06:25] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, make that tar but add --exclude=/home and then backup home separate
[06:25] <nolimitsoya> Denyerec, why not?
[06:25] <Denyerec> I have too much configured on here
[06:25] <Denyerec> users, shares, DB's
[06:26] <Denyerec> cron jobs, etc.
[06:26] <phonox> remove your ati-package and reinstall it again.
[06:26] <nevron> ok
[06:26] <Denyerec> It'll take me weeks to get everything restored on a clean isntall

[06:28] <extern> why can't my other computer resolve website address into ip's? (I'm using ubuntu box for connection sharing)
[06:28] <fleebailey33> nothlit, ?
[06:28] <nevron> ok phonox did exactly as you said
[06:28] <nolimitsoya> extern, dns problem?
[06:28] <phonox> if you restart your xserver, you should be able to call glxinfo
[06:28] <fleebailey33> and the hdd isnt working
[06:28] <nothlit> fleebailey33, are you sure your hardware configuration hasn't changed during those times?
[06:29] <nothlit> fleebailey33, it doesn't sound like a software problem if its sporadic
[06:29] <fleebailey33> no its always been like this
[06:29] <extern> I can browse the internet normally on ubuntu, but the other machine can't resolve addresses
[06:29] <fleebailey33> since first install
[06:29] <phonox> nevron: search your xorg.conf for disabled aiglx
[06:29] <nothlit> fleebailey33, you said it booted three times
[06:29] <fleebailey33> yes
[06:29] <extern> what can I do about it?
[06:29] <xu_zhu> pike_: yeah, ifconfig will give me a list of my eth0, wlan0, etc... and have the MAC addresses tasked to those.  wlan0 and wlan1 have the same MAC address, my old crappy card.  i want to set wlan1 MAC to a card i know works so i can see if i just have a faulty card.  so i need to figure out what hte mac address of that card is.
[06:29] <pike_> extern: compare the /etc/resolv.conf files on each computer. for a simple home setup one line like "nameserver 192.168.0.1" is usually all you need
[06:29] <nothlit> extern, you can use firestarted to set up internet connection sharing
[06:29] <fleebailey33> but it takes 30-40 timnes between boots
[06:29] <fleebailey33> im stubborn
[06:29] <nothlit> extern, firestarter*
[06:30] <nothlit> fleebailey33, and livecds boot fine?
[06:30] <nevron> phobox nothing like that
[06:30] <fleebailey33> wouldnt know

[06:30] <nevron> is there an option for enabling it
[06:30] <phonox> moment plz
[06:31] <nevron> by the way glxinfo is still giving me the same error

[06:43] <nolimitsoya> nothlit, the links does not contain anything new. same ref to the xfce menu editor, that is useless since it cant edit the main meny where all the programs are sorted, and then suggesting the dubious solution of manualy editing the .desktop-files, which i already know how to but dont want to since its such a chore :)
[06:44] <pike_> xu_zhu: youre trying to determine which device goes to which mac? sorry maybe im just being a little slow today :)
[06:44] <nevron> damn can you just tell me how can i delete this broken link?
[06:44] <slicky_> jhutchins: yes, and then?

[06:45] <j2daosh> then just rm
[06:45] <xu_zhu> pike_: no, im trying to determine the MAC address of the USB wireless device.  wlan0 and wlan1 are both tasked to my old card.  ndiswrapper tells me my stable card is working, but i cant figure out the MAC.
[06:45] <j2daosh> that will delete the file
[06:45] <xu_zhu> basicly, im trying to setup two wirelss devices on one box and task one to wlan0 and one to wlan1
[06:45] <nolimitsoya> nevron, deleting is usualy done with rm <filename>. should apply tolinks as well... provided they arent symlinks
[06:45] <phonox> sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2
[06:45] <xu_zhu> so i can figure out if i have a faulty card or a faulty configuration.

[06:53] <Br0Allz> fyrestrtr driver ?? the newst
[06:53] <nothlit> fleebailey33, you could chmod /tmp
[06:53] <Br0Allz> fyrestrtr i dont know what you mean :S
[06:53] <nevron> and once i quit i believe i will have to reinstall everything :)
[06:53] <fleebailey33> how?
[06:53] <WizCraker> hmm, so I did an apt-get remove for apache php5 and yet I'm still able to see a web page for apache being installed.
[06:53] <nothlit> magic_ninja, for mp3 playing, the two major players are amarok and listen
[06:53] <fyrestrtr> Br0Allz: are you using the driver from the repositories, or the driver from nivida.com?
[06:53] <nothlit> magic_ninja, there are a lot more sparse players of course
[06:54] <phonox> hmm.
[06:54] <fleebailey33> i think its permissions
[06:54] <Br0Allz> fyrestrtr i am using from envy site
[06:54] <Crescendo_> Man, for someone trying to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 - the information is ridiculously obscure.
[06:54] <fleebailey33> not booting as read/write or root
[06:54] <Br0Allz> fyrestrtr !envy
[06:54] <fyrestrtr> Br0Allz: what is 'envy site'? I've never heard of this.
[06:54] <nevron> heheh phonox i think i have just pulvarised my linux box :)
[06:54] <nothlit> WizCraker, aptitude search ~iapache
[06:54] <Crescendo_> "Please visit ubuntulinux.org for the upgrade."
[06:54] <Br0Allz> !envy
[06:54] <Ubotwo> envy is a Python script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[06:54] <Br0Allz> fyrestrtr there you go
[06:54] <magic_ninja> now on to the next lesson...would the drive from the repos or from nvidia give best performace (i'm getting like 30 fps in et with a 256 mb card
[06:54] <Br0Allz> fyrestrtr it is an automatic installer
[06:54] <fyrestrtr> Br0Allz: sorry, no experience with that -- you'd have to consult the website. I always use the 'manual' method.
[06:55] <nothlit> magic_ninja, its not whether its from a package or from nvidia, its the version
[06:55] <fyrestrtr> the only automatic install I like is apt-get :)
[06:55] <phonox> nevron: what does a sudo apt-get -s install ubuntu-desktop say?
[06:55] <Br0Allz> fyrestrtr so is there no way to fix this ????
[06:55] <diezare> nolimitsoya, I still don't get it. I installed linux-686-smp does this mean that I've to install linux-686 and linux-headers-686?
[06:55] <nothlit> magic_ninja, and every nvidia driver has different performances (and for different things too)
[06:55] <fyrestrtr> there might be, I wouldn't know anything about though. You'd have to ask someone that has used the script.
[06:55] <computermc> how do I apply folder/file permissions to everything under a certain folder?
[06:55] <nevron> reprts broken packages
[06:56] <nolimitsoya> diezare, -generic has made all others obsolete. you shouldnt be running -686 in the first place
[06:56] <nothlit> magic_ninja, you have to balance that and how much the driver can do
[06:56] <phonox> can you tell me the exact outpub?
[06:56] <nolimitsoya> diezare, apart from that, yes youd have to install the corresponding headers and modules
[06:56] <nevron> ok i will paste bin the output
[06:56] <nothlit> computermc, chmod -R
[06:56] <fyrestrtr> computermc: chmod -R [permissions]  /folder/
[06:56] <magic_ninja> nothlit: right but i'm new to tweaking on linux
[06:56] <sidny4> I'm working on setting up twinview and I'm not sure how to find the horizontal sync and vertical refresh rate, how do I find that out?
[06:56] <nothlit> computermc, if you're doing it graphically, theres a button that has apply to enclosed files on it
[06:57] <nevron> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37792/ here is what it says phonox
[06:57] <fyrestrtr> sidny4: google.
[06:57] <WizCraker> nothlit: I see a few things... apache2-common apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils
[06:57] <computermc> nothlit: I clicked that and it didn't apply them.
[06:57] <fyrestrtr> sidny4: search your monitor model.
[06:57] <n2diy> sidny4: do a google search for the make and model of your monitor.
[06:57] <Valmarko> Where can I get support for beryl?
[06:57] <diezare> nolimitsoya, But I still feel a big diffrence. When I run  the kernel which is installed with the linux it doesn't detect 2 cpus, it detects only 1. and I got duo core. And the diffrence is noticable.
[06:57] <nothlit> magic_ninja, just stay with the default drivers nvidia gives you, believe, me its a real hassle to go back, if you do you have to manually disable a driver in a text config file
[06:58] <fyrestrtr> Valmarko: #ubuntu-xgl
[06:58] <Valmarko> tank you
[06:58] <computermc> Valmarko: I think there is a beryl channel on freenode
[06:58] <computermc> #beryl
[06:58] <computermc> I think
[06:58] <Valmarko> tanks
[06:58] <sidny4> I've done that, but from looking at other setups there is always a range like 31-56 or something like that
[06:58] <nothlit> computermc, i can't see what you're doing wrong, so you can always just use chmod -R permissions /path/to/folder
[06:58] <magic_ninja> nothlit: so the nvidia.com drivers don't give that much of a performance increase
[06:58] <phonox> hmm
[06:58] <killermach> nothlit: anymore suggestions? I have run lshw -C display, but not sure what to check for
[06:58] <nolimitsoya> diezare, as i said, -generic has made all others obsolete, and does have smp support. youve been running some other strange kernel, probably -386
[06:58] <computermc> nothlit: ok thanks
[06:58] <nothlit> WizCraker, what exactly do you want to do
[06:58] <xu_zhu> pike_: im an idiot.  i was using a driver on a cd-rom.  i have sinced removed the cdrom.  copying the file to the harddrive fixed the problem.
[06:58] <phonox> usually it shoultn't be a prob
[06:59] <diezare> nolimitsoya, so what should I install now?
[06:59] <nothlit> magic_ninja, like i said, they don't give any increase, you can always get different versions from different repos
[06:59] <fleebailey33> i cant chomd
[06:59] <n2diy> sidny4:  there are two ranges, one for horizontal, and one for vertical.
[06:59] <nolimitsoya> diezare, -generic, for the last time...
[06:59] <pike_> xu_zhu: ha :) glad its working
[06:59] <nevron> phonox now what am i gonna do :D
[06:59] <phonox> can you do a sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade?
[06:59] <sidny4> "SecondMonitorHorizSync"        "31-82"
[06:59] <nothlit> magic_ninja, as long as the driver version is the same, the only difference is method of installation (which will change how maintainable it is)
[06:59] <sidny4> what does that mean?
[06:59] <nothlit> !sudo fleebailey33
[06:59] <Ubotwo> Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[07:00] <nothlit> !sudo | fleebailey33
[07:00] <Ubotwo> fleebailey33: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:00] <FlimFlamMan> hi.  the time has come that i need a laptop.  is there a model that works especially well with ubuntu, and with linux in general?
[07:00] <neurosis__> sidny4: Horizontal sync frequency for your second monitor? :>
[07:00] <diezare> nolimitsoya, there is a module in the kernel I want to install it's MMC support, should I recompile the kernel?
[07:00] <fleebailey33> i know sudo that thank you
[07:00] <nothlit> killermach, look at help.ubuntu.com/community/Video for help with intel graphic cards
[07:00] <magic_ninja> FlimFlamMan: sure just go to google.com/linux and type "linux compatible laptop"
[07:00] <fleebailey33> sudo chmod -R /tmp
[07:00] <nevron> it updates nothing phonox
[07:00] <WizCraker> nothlit: well, I had php5 and 4 running side by side so I removed php4 and then everything just broke.  I figured I would just remove everything and just install what I want.  apache2, php5, and mysql5
[07:00] <nothlit> !hardware | FlimFlamMan
[07:00] <Ubotwo> FlimFlamMan: For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
[07:00] <magic_ninja> FlimFlamMan: you can probably even get it pre-loaded
[07:00] <sidny4> neurosis__: yup, that's what I'm trying to find, same with the vertical
[07:00] <neurosis__> sidny4: I'm running dual monitors (TwinView) and I have that line as well
[07:00] <FlimFlamMan> thanks folks
[07:01] <cberlo> Anyone got a quick and dirty user administration interface?  One of my projects simply interfaces with Active Directory, but for two other projects, I need to keep user accounts up to date manually.
[07:01] <nothlit> WizCraker, what was it about the apache page still being there or something?
[07:01] <n2diy> sidny4: your horizontal sync rate is between 31 and 82 hertz
[07:01] <rene> hi
[07:01] <GreyGhost> !hello ubotu
[07:01] <nothlit> FlimFlamMan, system76.com
=== rene is now known as moldy_
[07:01] <sidny4> n2diy: does that need to be exact though?
[07:01] <GreyGhost> !hi ubotu ?
[07:01] <GreyGhost> !hi
[07:01] <moldy_> how can i set the default editor to vim, so that e.g. crontab -e uses it?
[07:01] <GreyGhost> [hmm.... i'll stop spamming him ....
[07:01] <neurosis__> sidny4: You can usually get the exact specs from your monitor manufacturer's website
[07:01] <n2diy> sidny4: no, you need to be in between them.
[07:02] <phonox> try sudo apt-get install  xserver-xorg-video-ati first
[07:02] <nevron> phonox should i insert the cd and look for specific repositories
[07:02] <ubotu> hello: The classic greeting, and a good example. In component main, is optional. Version 2.1.1-4 (edgy), package size 47 kB, installed size 472 kB
[07:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hi ubotu ? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:02] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[07:02] <nevron> i dont have the synaptic but
[07:02] <dfcarney> Whenever I attempt to open a .PHP file (from Firefox or Konqueror) located in /var/www/... on my machine, it loops endlessly, creating new tabs each iteration.  Any ideas what's causing this and how to fix it?
[07:02] <fyrestrtr> moldy_: echo 'EDITOR=vim' >> ~/.bashrc
[07:02] <secureboot_> anyone know how to set up gnome to run a specified command (not in the keyboard shortcuts list) when I hit a specific key?
[07:02] <moldy_> fyrestrtr: thanks
[07:02] <WizCraker> nothlit: yes, it was still there.  Now after useing aptitude to remove its gone.  will try to install everything fresh and see if it works.  thanks for the help.
[07:02] <phonox> you can install everything with apt-get
[07:02] <nevron> but as you see i cant right now :)
[07:02] <fyrestrtr> moldy_: better put it in ~/.bash_profile
[07:03] <nothlit> WizCraker, ahh yeah, you need to get rid of the straggling packages :) thats what the search command was
[07:03] <fyrestrtr> moldy_: for system-wide use, /etc/profile
[07:03] <moldy_> fyrestrtr: yep, just added it to /etc/profile :) thanks
[07:03] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Every PHP script, or just one particular one?
[07:03] <nothlit> !alternatives
[07:03] <ubotu> To change the default applications system-wide, use 'sudo update-alternatives --all' in a terminal.
[07:03] <GreyGhost> nevron ,the repo list in one piece?
[07:03] <dfcarney> neurosis__: all that I've tried so far.  I'm about to write a dummy one...
[07:04] <nothlit> dfcarney, why are you trying to open php scripts like that? you do it from the apache server, or you use editors to edit them
[07:04] <phonox> ok, maybe $ sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-386 linux-restricted-modules-generic
[07:04] <phonox> helps
[07:04] <dfcarney> nothlit: I'm using vi to edit them, but I'm trying to "run" them via Apache 1.3 w/ PHP5
[07:05] <nevron> everything is in one piece but i removed libmesa something and now i am on a virtual desktop which is loadden into the ram and every application collapses as soons as i click them becaus in reality they are not there :D
[07:05] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Are you opening them via file:/// or http:// ?
[07:05] <extern> there's still no flash plugin for 64 bit version linux?
[07:05] <dfcarney> neurosis__: http://
[07:05] <fyrestrtr> extern: no
[07:05] <nothlit> extern, you need to run it in 32bit
[07:05] <Atoms> hello, i have bought linksys wireless PCI card (RaLink RT2561/RT61 802.11g PCI) now im using http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=296822&highlight=rt61 also downloaded latest version of driver, and its not compiling, maybe someone can help, the output is: http://pastebin.ca/283861
[07:06] <extern> I know how to run it in 32bits :P just strange that it is taking so long to release an appropriate 64 bit versoin
[07:06] <nevron> phonox any suggestions or should i start installing my brand new ubuntu :P
[07:06] <neurosis__> dfcarney: The PHP install work on your webserver? Can you run the .php scripts from the command line interpreter?
[07:06] <phonox> ok i search for libmesa package
[07:07] <fyrestrtr> Atoms: what release are you running?
[07:07] <Atoms> feisty
[07:07] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Not sure how to do that -- can you explain?
[07:07] <magic_ninja> is there a way to add a drive to fstab w/out manually typing it out
[07:07] <fyrestrtr> Atoms: please ask in #ubuntu+1
[07:07] <phonox> sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa
[07:07] <Shaba1> Hello all
[07:07] <Atoms> fyrestrtr ok :) tnx anyway
[07:08] <nevron> ok i installed them but still i can t install ubuntu desktop :D
[07:08] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Run your script from the command line: # php < myFile.php
[07:08] <Shaba1> Has anyone had any experiance connecting linux workstations to a Win2k network?
[07:08] <phonox> f**K
[07:08] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Even an empty .PHP file causes infinite loops.  I.e. "<?php ?> EOF"
[07:08] <nevron> :P
[07:08] <Shaba1> NOT using samba.
[07:08] <phonox> ok. something is really weird.
[07:08] <nevron> is there a way to install ubuntu without formating the partitions
[07:08] <nevron> hheheh
[07:08] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: how exactly did you install php?
[07:09] <phonox> i guess your x is entirely broken now.
[07:09] <narvik86> Shaba1: connecting what for?
[07:09] <nevron> phonox i told you so :D
[07:09] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: "apt-get install wordpress" installed it automatically for me
=== CWiZ is now known as CactusWiZaRd
[07:09] <Shaba1> I do not want to have the windows workstations connect to linux shares. I want the linux workstation to connect to a windows PDC,Active Directory and Shares
[07:09] <ollekalle> question: I am looking into a guide for mythtv that sais: "see instructions below with the small change of the instructon. Instead of 'UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('<password>') WHERE user='root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;' ..."   - does anyone have a clue what to do with that line - shall I use it in an config file or as a parameter to some command?
[07:09] <nevron> damn ati damn mesa and :D
[07:09] <dfcarney> neurosis__: I don't seem to have the interpreter installed...which is weird because I'd expect it to be included with php-common or something like that.
[07:10] <nevron> ok phonox i am reinstalling my ubuntu desktop :D
[07:10] <calvarez> what are the GNOME and KDE versions in the Edgy Eft DVD?
[07:10] <dfcarney> neurosis__: That is, the command-line interpreter
[07:10] <phonox> the next time you want 3d accelereation, wait for ati to support aiglrx
[07:10] <n2diy> In system/admin/disks, my USB drive show up as both a cdrom, and a hard disk.
[07:10] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: php5-cli is what you need.
[07:10] <nevron> hhahahahahahahahaha
[07:10] <mlehrer> intel seems to have the best 3d support
[07:10] <mlehrer> in my experience
[07:10] <cberlo> n2diy: sounds like a recent SanDisk unit.
[07:10] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: Thanks.
[07:10] <nevron> i am giving up on linux i guess
[07:10] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: also, make sure you enabled the module in apache (a2enmod php I think)
[07:11] <mlehrer> too bad they only make built-in video chips and not agp/pci-x
[07:11] <Shaba1> narvik86 I have a windows 2k server network using logonscripts, and policies that verify the user in AD before letting him/her to the desktop. I am getting 15 blank pent4 computers today and a ubuntu disk.
[07:11] <dfcarney> neurosis__: From the command line it just exits (as it should)
[07:11] <n2diy> cberlo: I got it in May.
[07:11] <phonox> if you choose to do the partitioning on install, the installer claims to refornat your root-partition. the others shouldn't be affected
[07:11] <mlehrer> nevron: what is the problem you're having?
[07:11] <fyrestrtr> Shaba1: you must not like the easy way :)
[07:11] <Shaba1> I want to find some way of setting the linux machines up in the same way that I already have the windows machines
[07:11] <linda777> I just installed ubuntu-desktop, and the video resolution is correct for my screen and card, but the redraw rate is painfully slow -- it's like the acceleration is not on. I have an ATI radeon card. Any suggestions?
[07:11] <narvik86> Shaba1: i don't know if its possible to do it without samba, maybe use samba ans simply dont share(on ubuntu) anything in network?
[07:12] <Shaba1> That is immaterial fyrestrtr I have to do what needs to be done.
[07:12] <cberlo> n2diy: I've only come across one of those guys -- some auto-run program fires up on the disk portion and "loads" the cd-rom portion
[07:12] <nevron> i was having a small broken link and to fix that i remoevd mesa somethng and my x is completely broken by now in only an hour :d
[07:12] <fyrestrtr> Shaba1: obviously you cannot share some profile settings, as they will not apply.
[07:12] <narvik86> Shaba1: why you don't want to use samba
[07:12] <nothlit> Shaba1, have you looked at samba.org?
[07:12] <cberlo> n2diy: ...but as far as I've seen, only on Windoze.
[07:12] <phonox> but be sure to select manual partitioning. then gparted comes up and then do nothing
[07:12] <nevron> just because of a stupid libGL.so.1 file
[07:12] <neurosis__> dfcarney:  it was libapache-mod-php5 for me, and the php5 metapackage
[07:12] <Narada> how do i install mysql4 on ubuntu?
[07:12] <nevron> phonox i am dual booting
[07:12] <calvarez> linda777, you have to install the ATI drivers
[07:12] <reverseblade> Does anybody know where can I find the latest alsa drivers in deb package ?
[07:12] <nevron> isnt there a chance to reinstall with same settings?
[07:12] <n2diy> cberlo: Roger that, it works ok, so I'm not going to worry about it.
[07:12] <linda777> Do I do that through the package manager?
[07:12] <phonox> do you have grub to select windows?
[07:12] <calvarez> linda777, I can't help you much (since I don't have ATI cards), bu8t ask about that
[07:12] <nevron> when i boot from cd
[07:13] <ChevronX> Hey guys, I have a removable USB drive but I cannot write to it, what do I do
[07:13] <fyrestrtr> Narada: sudo apt-get install mysql-server-4.1
[07:13] <dfcarney> neurosis__: It doesn't appear that package is available to me...
[07:13] <Shaba1> narvik86: As I said Samba goes the other way windows client to linux network. I need to go linux client to windows network.
[07:13] <calvarez> linda777, probably, again, you could google for directions
[07:13] <dfcarney> neurosis__: ...E: Package libapache-mod-php5 has no installation candidate
[07:13] <radar1976> grrr if it isn't one thing, it is another
[07:13] <fyrestrtr> Shaba1: samba works both ways.
[07:13] <linda777> I have done that. I can't find an answer that doesn't give specific adddresses for previous builds.
[07:13] <narvik86> it can't be configured?
[07:13] <nothlit> Shaba1, samba can go both ways
[07:13] <cberlo> n2diy: Yeah, pretty much nothing to worry about.  Stick it in a Windows machine and you'll see "extra features" with it.  But if you lock the disk with the Windows tools, you won't be able to access it in Linux.
[07:13] <nothlit> Shaba1, look through the manual, its very extensive
[07:13] <nevron> ok bye phonox i am leaving the box as it is i will reinstall everything tomorrow
[07:14] <radar1976> ok installed edgy... now my atheros wireless does not work... i have the madwifi modules installed
[07:14] <Shaba1> everything I have read on samba on the web suggest its windows to linux
[07:14] <phonox> ok. good luck
[07:14] <Narada> fyrestrtr: perfect thanks
[07:14] <nevron> aiglx doesnt work on dual heads people a fact of life :)

[07:15] <linda777> OK, these instructions include having to recompile the kernel...
[07:15] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: is a2enmod for apache2, or apache?
[07:15] <Vuen> wow, nevermind, it kept going
[07:15] <GreyGhost> linda777 ,if the driver comes in a .deb i suppose only apt-get install will do ....
[07:15] <mlehrer> nevron: you can at least log in on the command line, can't you
[07:15] <nevron> i mean it is too complicated for me you have to reconfig everything in order to fix a broken link?

[07:17] <ubotu> dfcarney: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[07:17] <Shaba1> Ok let me ask a stupid question
[07:17] <linda777> Is there not a utility that will detect my card and find the appropriate driver for it?
[07:17] <manmadha> %H<%H these lines are comming before and after the user what is the problem?
[07:17] <phonox> we can create the symlink from libGL.so.1 to libGL.so.1.2 new
[07:17] <Shaba1> Is there something in linux akin to a windows logon script?
[07:17] <manmadha> plzz help me
[07:17] <fyrestrtr> manmadha: your characterset/encoding is not right.
[07:17] <nevron> too late phonox there s nothing left to fix :)
[07:17] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: problem being that Ubuntu's wordpress package depends on apache (and it'll disable apache2)
[07:18] <fyrestrtr> Shaba1: yes, in gnome there is.
[07:18] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: time to install from source, i guess.
[07:18] <manmadha> how to set it?
[07:18] <fyrestrtr> Shaba1: and system-wide (ie, non GUI) there are MANY.
[07:18] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: no, no no.
[07:18] <magic_ninja> grr now no sound in amarok
[07:18] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: remove the wordpress package.
[07:18] <manmadha> fyrestrtr, i have installed it from tar ball
[07:18] <phonox> hmm.
[07:18] <nolimitsoya> magic_ninja, have you installed xine-extracodecs?
[07:18] <Shaba1> OK.
[07:18] <nevron> see you i will run a stupid xp box and i think i may even pray bill gates for creating a system for idiots like me :D
[07:18] <dfcarney> dfcarney: and?
[07:18] <Shaba1> what is it called Firetech
[07:18] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: follow the lamp wiki, then install wordpress from source.
[07:19] <extern> how can I erase a cdrw?
[07:19] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: that's what I meant when I said, "Time to install from source"
[07:19] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: :)
[07:19] <dm> Anyone here a Beryl user
[07:19] <magic_ninja> now i just have no rear sound
[07:19] <phonox> it is really weird that you can't reinstall ubuntu-desktop. it would fix the worst problems for now at least
[07:19] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: oh good, i thought you mean time to install apache from source *eek*
[07:19] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: No, that would be suicide.
[07:19] <phonox> HES GONE.
[07:19] <Shaba1> I first need to have the unbuntu linux machines query for dhcp, then I have to find some way of blocking access until they check with the win2k server for a valid account
[07:19] <fyrestrtr> phonox: ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package (just a master list of other packages to install)
[07:20] <manmadha> is there any solution?
[07:20] <Shaba1> blocking access to using the machine that is.
[07:20] <magic_ninja> nolimitsoya: i think i need to unmute a certain device
[07:20] <fyrestrtr> manmadha: install xchat from the repositories.

[07:23] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[07:23] <n2diy> tim167, I believe apt-get has a flag you can set to force the install.
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> diezare_, cant you just download a prebuild module and modprobe it?
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> *prebuilt

[07:26] <FifaFrazer> Hi, I'm having a problem compiling the newest version of gpsim

[07:26] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[07:26] <nolimitsoya> magic_ninja, are you sure they are both speaker outputs? you wont get soudn in the rear channel of a surround sound card if the source is 2ch, fex. not without upsampling, and you dont want that
[07:26] <klassicd> where are the .desktop files located?
[07:26] <klassicd> or the menu application items
[07:26] <tim167>  n2diy: cant find the option for that, also 'force version' is grayed out in the menu...
[07:26] <mrlinux> fyrestrtr, where is the flie
[07:26] <FifaFrazer> The configure goes fine, but the make file gives me the following: http://paste.uni.cc/12339
[07:27] <magic_ninja> nolimitsoya: i had it set up before to give me 4 ch sound, is it the card i need to configure or the mp3 file?
[07:27] <fyrestrtr> mrlinux: man dhcpd it tells you there.
[07:27] <neurosis__> klassicd: /usr/share/applications
[07:27] <mrlinux> fyrestrtr, k thx
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> magic_ninja, the player, or card

[07:27] <n2diy> From Nautilus I right clicked on /usr/bin, and it indicated the size of the directory was 89 megs, but it wouldn't fit on a 500 meg USB stick?
[07:27] <narvik86> FifaFrazer: maybe try: sudo make
[07:27] <n2diy> tim167, try it from the command line.
[07:28] <neurosis__> klassicd: Next time, you could use slocate or find files to find 'em
[07:28] <magic_ninja> nolimitsoya: ok, i figured a channel was just messed on the mixer
[07:28] <dm> Does anyone know how to make Beryl 0.1.3 cube put windows on 3d planes and take it off the desktop. #beryl does not reply

[07:30] <obstfliege> nabend!
[07:30] <fyrestrtr> FifaFrazer: what are you trying to install?
[07:30] <FifaFrazer> the newest version of gpsim
[07:30] <joeljkp> is there a recommended way to install my own openoffice.org?
[07:31] <Stormx2> joeljkp: repos?
[07:31] <derFlo> lm-sensors says:Unable to find i2c bus information;
[07:31] <derFlo> For 2.6 kernels, make sure you have mounted sysfs and libsensors
[07:31] <derFlo> was compiled with sysfs support!
[07:31] <derFlo> For older kernels, make sure you have done 'modprobe i2c-proc'!
[07:31] <fyrestrtr> FifaFrazer: have you installed build-essential?
[07:31] <joeljkp> stormx2: are there third-party repos for the latest version?
[07:31] <Stormx2> joeljkp: Not sure.
[07:31] <FifaFrazer> gpsim 0.22.0 - the one in the repos are to old...

[07:32] <joeljkp> stormx2: so just a matter of removing all ooo packages, plus ubuntu-desktop, then installing the new version?
[07:32] <Valmarko> I installed beryl several times and its always the same problem
[07:32] <derFlo> you guys are a great help to me...
[07:32] <pike_> joeljkp: normally i mkdir ~/local and install there first then /usr/local if it works ok
[07:33] <fyrestrtr> Valmarko: beryl is beta software, which means it will have bugs. Please discuss beryl in #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl, not here.
[07:33] <Stormx2> joeljkp: Not if you're getting a deb / backporting
[07:33] <n2diy> FifaFrazer: development packages for compiling stuff
[07:33] <Valmarko> sorry.

[07:34] <Antissn> will you soon have package to play ghost recon advanced warfighter

[07:36] <marty-mcfly> nano
[07:36] <malt> a config editor
[07:36] <iratik> yeah, nano is great - it doesn't wrap lines like vim

[07:36] <iratik> or gedit?
[07:36] <naylor> no doesnt work: http://pastebin.ca/283900

[07:36] <pike_> bah to nano. vim
[07:37] <marty-mcfly> nano is more sexy :-P
[07:37] <Stormx2> you could mean nano, or you could mean gnome-gconf-editor

[07:40] <fyrestrtr> iratik: sudo -i, then su www-data
[07:40] <n2diy> Desert88, what is the error?

[07:42] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: quote?
[07:42] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr, neurosis__: seems that it's enabled and running.  I *can* open a php file now (and phpinfo() displays a proper output)
[07:43] <neurosis__> dfcarney: from the command line interpreter?
[07:43] <manmadha> .
[07:43] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: then its solved then?
[07:43] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: Your command yielded the following output, "This module is already enabled!"

[07:44] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: what are you naming the files?
[07:44] <pike_> lynucs: run "alsamixer" in terminal might be as simple as setting up there
[07:44] <naylor> can anyone please help me out?
[07:44] <naylor> my error is: http://pastebin.ca/283900
[07:44] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: I'm following the "official" wordpress install
[07:44] <lynucs> well i tried already (but not in konsole)
[07:44] <Antissn> how to install C++ or were to get it, need to encode the AMD cpu for ubuntu
[07:44] <lynucs> ill try again
[07:44] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: Maybe it's a permissions problem.  I admit that I know little/nothing about web servers (kernel and hardware issues are more my area)
[07:45] <pussfeller> apt-get overwrote my grub menulist!
[07:45] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Wordpress was fairly easy for me -- I grabbed the distro from their site, dropped it in /usr/share, and symlinked from /var/www
[07:45] <pussfeller> tell me it makes a backup somewhere
[07:45] <naylor> is anyone there please?

[07:45] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[07:45] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: what do the logs say?
[07:45] <dfcarney> neurosis__: that's basically what I did.  What permissions are on the dir in /usr/share?
[07:45] <tsg_> I'm trying to play a DVD in Edgy, I've installed libdvdcss, and all the gstreamer plugins that ubuntu officially says need to be installed, but the DVD is still not playing in either Totem or Xine

[07:45] <Dybber> I have a problem with some fonts in GTK1 applications (as an example xfontsel and gtkfontsel doesnt show bitstream vera fonts)
[07:45] <Stormx2> Antissn: build-essential
[07:46] <tsg_> so, what's not working?
[07:46] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: Well, there no entries in the logs for any of the access I tried that trigger the looping behavior
[07:46] <neurosis__> dfcarney: root root, rwxr-xr-x
[07:46] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: Accesses, rather.
[07:46] <naylor> my add remove doesn't work, bittorrent doesnt work and automatix2 doesnt' work and other stuff, and get this error: http://pastebin.ca/283900
[07:46] <Antissn> stormx2 : is this a program or a question
[07:46] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: how are you accessing the files? What happens when you type http://localhost?
[07:46] <elanghe> hey all, I have a question about ubuntu support options I'm hoping someon can help me out
[07:47] <fyrestrtr> naylor: ouch @ automatix -- automatix breaks stuff.
[07:47] <Antissn> dowload opera it have all
[07:47] <flon> i'm having a problem using shares-admin.  I have some shares but I cannot delete them.  Everytime i delete them in shares-admin they are gone, but if i reload shares-admin they are back.  I've tried looking at my /etc/samba/smb.conf file but i don't even see an entry on my list.  I can however add new shares to my list, but i can't delete those either.  Anyone wanna take a crack at helping me out?
[07:47] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: same problem
[07:47] <elanghe> Does Ubuntu include the security updates (like redhat network) or do I have to purchase a support contract to get them?
[07:47] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: please be more specific. What exactly happens, when you open a browser, and type http://localhost
[07:47] <Antissn> go to mininova.org if not a huge site to get files at www.katz.ws
[07:47] <neurosis__> elanghe: Security updates are free
[07:47] <fyrestrtr> elanghe: they are included
[07:48] <seba-> ok, i'm trying to test ubuntu as a live cd, and like it starts, loggs in and then logs out, after 10 seconds it logs in again, infinte loop, any ideas? is just a default 6.10 ubuntu i386 desktop cd.
[07:48] <elanghe> great! Thank you
[07:48] <naylor> fyrestrtr, automatix didn't do this though, it was reinstalling the nvidia drivers and not sure what i did but now i get this: http://pastebin.ca/283900  - it's a gtk/python prob but not sure how to fix it
[07:48] <tsg_> I'm trying to play a DVD in Edgy, I've installed libdvdcss, and all the gstreamer plugins that ubuntu officially says need to be installed, but the DVD is still not playing in either Totem or Xine, anyone know what the problem is?
[07:48] <neurosis__> dfcarney: I take it you reinstalled apache? When you first came here you said you were using apache 1.x, now you're 2.x?
[07:49] <fyrestrtr> naylor: well I don't know exactly what automatix does -- all I know is, its not good for ubuntu and we don't recommend it or support it.
[07:49] <LucidFox> is it possible to get 4L LightScribe to work in Edgy, as it did in Dapper?
[07:49] <Antissn> here is all software of linux : http://www.mininova.org/sub/17
[07:50] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: It asks me what I want to use to open a .PHP file (in a pop-up).  If I select "Firefox" and click "OK", another tab opens and the process starts over again.  If I click on the "Do this automatically from now on" box, it just loops forever.
[07:50] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Yup -- I upgraded to v2, as per !lamp
[07:50] <naylor> can anyone please please help me out?
[07:50] <neurosis__> dfcarney: you upgrade from synaptic or something?
[07:50] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: now this may sound stupid, but tell me exactly what you are typing in the browser window.
[07:51] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Not to my knowledge.
[07:51] <fyrestrtr> gnomefreak: thanks.
[07:51] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: I've tried "http://localhost", "http://localhost/", and "localhost"
[07:51] <neurosis__> dfcarney: You need some relevent 'AddType' lines in your apache conf
[07:51] <lynucs> pike thank you, now it worked.. dunno why it didnt before :)
[07:51] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: I've also tried "http://127.0.0.0:80" and "http://127.0.0.1:80"
[07:51] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: you get that PHP popup when you type http://localhost?
[07:51] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Or else apache won't know how to serve files of type .php, etc
[07:51] <malt> nice proftpd owns :D
[07:51] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: yup
[07:52] <tsg_> how do I edit sources.list?
[07:52] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: what do you have in /var/www/ ?
[07:52] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: apache2-default  foo.php  index.html  phpmyadmin  wordpress
[07:52] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: foo is the phpinfo script, index.html is a dummy fily
[07:52] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: foo is the phpinfo script, index.html is a dummy file
[07:53] <neurosis__> dfcarney: it doesn't even serve .html files?
[07:53] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: apache2-default, phpmyadmin, and wordpress are directories
[07:53] <pike_> tsg_: either synaptic or just "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
[07:53] <dfcarney> neurosis__: no, and that's one source of my confusion
[07:53] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: sudo mv /var/www/foo.php /var/www/apache2-default/foo.php then http://localhost/foo.php
[07:53] <manmadha> dfcarney, u have to put the *.php files in /etc/var/www file
[07:53] <dfcarney> neurosis__: http://localhost/index.html works, as expected
[07:53] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Ah. You might try 'remove completely' and nuke your apache conf.

[07:55] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: what is in /var/www/apache2-default/ ?
[07:55] <deep> fyrestrtr: oh god, that is some player...

[07:56] <radar1976> is there a bug in the ath_pci for 2.6
[07:56] <radar1976> I can't get my netgear to work
[07:56] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: well, there's a tonne of index.html files for different locales, and a bunch of other stuff
[07:56] <manmadha> dfcarney, i have installed apache2& php5 lib2-modules also
[07:56] <tsg_> radar1976: what kind of netgear do you have?
[07:56] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: that is the default site that is enabled. Please read /etc/apache2/README
[07:56] <manmadha> can u help me?
[07:56] <Shaba1> Does ubuntu/linux use drivers for specific pieces of hardware? As does windows?
[07:56] <radar1976> Netgear wg511t
[07:56] <tsg_> is that a PCMCIA card?
[07:57] <LucidFox> Shaba1> yes, of course
[07:57] <Shaba1> No its a usb wifi adaptor
[07:57] <dfcarney> fyrestrtr: Offhand, I have no idea what the default site is; I just did a straight install.  Let me get back to you on that...
[07:57] <neurosis__> dfcarney: The default site is whatever is in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default, I think
[07:58] <Shaba1> and neither knoppix,ubuntu or DSL seemed to recognize it.
[07:58] <fyrestrtr> dfcarney: I'm *telling* you what it is. Please read the README file. It explains everything.
[07:58] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Look for 'DocumentRoot'

[07:59] <tsg_> radar1976: what have you done so far?
[07:59] <neurosis__> khaled: Yes
[08:00] <manmadha> dfcarney, can u plz help me?
[08:00] <Vuen> khaled: sure. they can even share swap space if you configure hibernate properly.
[08:00] <n2diy> khaled, yes.
[08:00] <jbutler> ?
[08:00] <khaled> so can how i do that?
[08:00] <neurosis__> manmadha: It sounds like he's having the same problem you are
[08:00] <Vuen> khaled: install the second one the same way you installed the first one :p

[08:01] <Vuen> hey guys, how do i switch the default display manager?
[08:01] <manmadha> neurosis__, he ee than k ....u got my poit ...
[08:01] <manmadha> than ku
[08:01] <neurosis__> ramvi: Did you sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart?
[08:01] <manmadha> thank s for the help
[08:01] <khaled> Vuen, i just need some details, i will tell you the current partitions i have, ok?
[08:01] <radar1976> I install Edgy and updated it
[08:01] <ramvi> neurosis__, yeah
[08:01] <radar1976> oh great... now the update failed
[08:02] <radar1976> I get a message kill: could not kill pid '1747' no such process  then it hangs
[08:02] <dfcarney> neurosis__: DocumentRoot is /var/www
[08:02] <neurosis__> ramvi: In /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf do you have  php5.conf specifying 'AddType'
[08:02] <khaled> Vuen, root (10G), var(2), swap(512M), /home(70G), multimedia(20G), future(10G)
[08:03] <neurosis__> Apache needs to know what file extensions are what mime types-- "AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3"
[08:03] <radar1976> ok a restart fixed it
[08:03] <khaled> Vuen, so what exactly should i do, should i delete multimedia or future and make /home for the new distro or can they share the same /home partitions?
[08:04] <ramvi> neurosis__, I dont know. But there are 4 lines of text. The first is <IfModule mod_php5.c>
[08:04] <radar1976> but no wireless
[08:04] <radar1976> still
[08:04] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Here's the crazy part -- I've now completely blown away *all* instances of wordpress and yet if I go to http://localhost and save the .php file instead, it turns out to be a wordpress-generated .php file.
[08:04] <dfcarney> neurosis__: This is nuts.
[08:04] <neurosis__> dfcarney: You mean.. HTML file?
[08:05] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Well, a .PHTML

[08:06] <brainiac_ghost> I get that when trying to "make" something
[08:06] <neurosis__> dfcarney: It shouldn't be that difficult though.. Seriously, a full LAMP install took me about 5 minutes - wordpress an additional 5-10 minutes. I suspect your config files are screwed from some previous mucking about
=== Shaba1 is now known as Shaba1-AFK
[08:06] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Which is why I suggested that when you remove/reinstall, to remove all configuration files as well
[08:07] <neurosis__> dfcarney: There is probably a more elegant way to do it, but in the interest of time :)
[08:07] <dfcarney> neurosis__: No, that's a quick-and-easy solution.  apt-get remove apache2 only?  Or PHP5 too?
[08:08] <Valmarko> Hello again. Ubuntu is not running because changed the file xorg . I know there is the recovery mode but I  dont know how to edit the file in bash. Could someone help me?
[08:08] <dfcarney> neurosis__: (plus rm -rf /etc/apache2)
[08:08] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Sure, or use synaptic 'remove completely' option
[08:08] <neurosis__> dfcarney: Don't both removing wordpress -- that part is pretty trivial. yOu need to get basic php files served
[08:09] <brainiac_ghost> Valmarko, sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[08:14] <brainiac_ghost> wee, compilation :D
[08:15] <brainiac_ghost> quiksilver2012, vista sucks (I have used it) photoshop might work on Crossover
[08:15] <quiksilver2012> yeah like i watch a video on my computer, and stream it to my mom's and girlfriends computer....and we can all watch it at the same time.?
[08:16] <neurosis__> quiksilver2012: Well, I think it would be easier just to have the file sitting on a share on your machine, and have them open it
[08:16] <khaled> can anyone help me with installing more than one linux distros on my pc?
[08:16] <quiksilver2012> but then its not "at the same time"\
[08:16] <quiksilver2012> streamed
[08:16] <neurosis__> quiksilver2012: You want synchronized video between 3 pcs?
[08:16] <quiksilver2012> yeah
[08:16] <quiksilver2012> :-D
[08:16] <neurosis__> quiksilver2012: Yeah, well YouTube is streamed, but not necessarily synchronized
[08:17] <quiksilver2012> true, i see what you're saying...but synced....to 3 computers...?
[08:17] <neurosis__> quiksilver2012: In that case.. I can't help you. But VLC stands for 'VideoLAN Client' - sounds like what you want is more of a server
[08:17] <quiksilver2012> but i thought you could stream it....at the same time?
[08:18] <aztek> just get everyone to push play at the same time
[08:18] <neurosis__> hehe
[08:18] <quiksilver2012> haha yeah, just hollar, 1, 2, 3! GO!
[08:18] <quiksilver2012> haha.
[08:18] <neurosis__> Just yell "GO!" so they can hear you
[08:18] <n2diy> khaled, put the new distro on your 10g future partition.
[08:18] <quiksilver2012> So i got Beryl running on Ubuntu and i love it...
[08:19] <khaled> n2diy, thanks man
[08:19] <neurosis__> quiksilver2012: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/streaming.html
[08:19] <quiksilver2012> is it hard on the computer if you dont have a "swap" partition?  and is "Page file" the same as the Linux "swap" ?
[08:19] <n2diy> khalled, nada.
[08:19] <aztek> How do you mean "hard" on the computer?
[08:20] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Great.  Now "sudo a2enmod php5" can't find the php5 module.
[08:20] <stoorty> if you have plenty of ram the computer will be fine
[08:20] <quiksilver2012> well worse performance?
[08:20] <fyrestrtr> quiksilver2012: depends on how much ram do you have, but yes, the concept is the same as the page file.
[08:20] <quiksilver2012> i only have 256 (its my mom's dell)
[08:20] <dfcarney> neurosis__: Though php < foo.php works on the command line.
[08:20] <stoorty> make a swap then
[08:20] <aztek> No, what stoorty said. Enough RAM will be fine.
[08:20] <fyrestrtr> you need swap
[08:20] <quiksilver2012> right...
[08:21] <quiksilver2012> so, is swap, the same as ..... "Windows ReadyBoost"?
[08:21] <ramvi> I've got LAMP installed, but firefox asks me to download the php-files to my HD..?
[08:21] <dfcarney> ramvi: I've got the exact same problem.
[08:21] <aztek> I've run without a page file in Windows and without swap in Linux. I just make sure I have a gig+ of RAM.
[08:21] <ramvi> dfcarney, feisty?
[08:21] <dfcarney> ramvi: Edgy
[08:22] <magic_ninja> how do i start a program with the command for the highest processor task
[08:22] <aztek> More than a gig isn't my suggestion just my preference
[08:22] <quiksilver2012> I heard this so called "Windows ReadyBoost" was stupid...

[08:30] <Stormx2> seba-: MD5sum the ISO?

[09:26] <Lunis> Okay, I have a question. I am using a Logitech multimedia keyboard, which means it has the volume wheel, among other wheels. This wheel has automatically been set by ubuntu ans the system volume up/down, which is great....but
[09:27] <pianoboy3333> crimsun_: are you there? I recently upgraded my kernel, and my alsa drivers got messed up
[09:27] <ldvx> asd
[09:27] <pianoboy3333> I need help reinstalling
[09:28] <h0ndaracer2> wow that was fast i already downloaded adobe photoshop cs2 in less than 3 minutes
[09:28] <Lunis> when i change the volume, it shows it onscreen as going up and down, but the volume does not change. when i try to change the volume by clicking the mixer tray icon once and sliding the slider up or down, the volume still doesn't change
[09:28] <HuibertGill> pianoboy3333: can you access you system now?
[09:28] <PriceChild> h0ndaracer2: downloaded... I'm guessing that isn't a legal dl... and also i'm guessing its not really photoshop in there
[09:28] <HuibertGill> !legal
[09:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about legal - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:29] <h0ndaracer2> it is im getting it off their site
[09:29] <Lunis> i believe the mixer is not changing the volume of the correct channel. it needs to be changing the volume of "Analog Front", but i believe it's changing the channel of "IEC958 Center/LFE"

[09:30] <Gosha> aptitude? >_<
[09:30] <Gosha> allerady did apt-get
[09:30] <h0ndaracer2> that was throught wireless tho

[09:32] <PriceChild> Lunis: right click the applet
[09:32] <PriceChild> and you you can change what volume is changed from one of those options... "properties" i think is the one

[09:33] <PriceChild> Lunis: no problem :)
[09:34] <Lunis> PriceChild: only problem now is how to get my keyboard volume wheel to change the volume correctly
[09:34] <FifaFrazer> Some instructions tell me to change to root, and then type "make install", but if I in ubuntu write "sudo make install" it says: "Unknown id: make" - How can i solve this?
[09:34] <PriceChild> lunis: You'll need to find out what mapping that has... then you can add it to "system>prefs>keyboard"...
[09:34] <Gosha> will xubuntu be run now when i restart?
[09:34] <PriceChild> however I can't remember how to find out the mapping
[09:35] <Gosha> or do i have to do something more, funnt?

[09:42] <pianoboy3333> crimsun_: what am I missing?
[09:42] <fkumro> swanfl, have you tried an smp kernel?
[09:42] <rmordico> hallo
[09:42] <cohnmacaulay> All: how to add a command-line to the gnome panel? there's no option for one in my "add to panel"
[09:42] <Gosha> .. how do i know if i run xubuntu now or not?
[09:42] <h0ndaracer2> i get no sucj file or directory
[09:42] <filthpig> After the modem is turned off (due to loss of electricity) and on again (power's back, yay), I cannot connect to the internet. This has recently happened to both me and my sister, both using Kubuntu, but while I use pppoe, she connects directly to the net with no username or password.
[09:42] <h0ndaracer2> with cd photo\ out
[09:42] <max1> HuibertGill:  thx, now I see two processes with 'apt' in the path how di I kill them?
[09:42] <swanfl> fkumro, I don't know how to choose an SMP kernel, short of compiling my own
[09:42] <crimsun_> pianoboy3333: ./configure --with-cards=hda-intel --with-oss=yes --with-sequencer=yes --with-debug=detect --with-kernel=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build && make && sudo make install-modules
[09:43] <Gosha> .. is there some funny way to find out
[09:43] <HuibertGill> max1: first find out what the other process is doing, are you running synaptic, aptitude, updatemanager?
[09:44] <max1> HuibertGill: I'm on a server
[09:44] <HuibertGill> max1: another one to try is "ps flax" which gives moore of atree structure off the procesess
[09:44] <fangorious> every time I log in I'm given the "X system keyboard settings differ from your current GNOME keyboard settings". I've tried changing System->Preferences->Keyboard to both what the dialog says was expected and what was found, and I still keep receiving the error
[09:44] <pianoboy3333> crimsun_: ok, one more thing, last time I compiled them, my sound would be muted when I turned my computer on everytime, is there something else I have to do/a way around this
[09:44] <filthpig> "luckily" I was able to reboot to windows and connect to the internet from there, and THEN everything worked fine in linux too, but my sister does not have windows at all, so I can't get her back on the net
[09:44] <filthpig> can somebody help me out?
[09:44] <HuibertGill> max1: are you "alone" on this server?
[09:44] <crimsun_> pianoboy3333: unmute it, save it.
[09:44] <n2diy> kaflan, it there, under layout options
[09:44] <blue-frog> h0ndaracer2: didn't come to your mind you would need to adapt to the folder name you have?...
[09:45] <Gosha> .. it's still nautilus ..
[09:45] <pianoboy3333> crimsun_: ok... save what though
[09:45] <h0ndaracer2> nop
[09:45] <max1> HuibertGill: yes it's running on a seperate pc
[09:45] <crimsun_> pianoboy3333: your mixer level.s

[09:46] <crimsun_> pianoboy3333: using whatever.
[09:46] <pianoboy3333> ok
[09:46] <pianoboy3333> brb
[09:46] <blue-frog> h0ndaracer2: give me the name of your folder
[09:46] <HuibertGill> max1: then kill the offending pids
[09:46] <aum> how hard is it to re-master one's own ubuntu dvd? I'm looking for a way to set up a custom ubuntu dvd to automatically mount an hdd for /home, /var etc
[09:47] <h0ndaracer2> Photoshop CS2
[09:47] <fkumro> swanfl, depends on your processor but you could try something like apt-get install linux-686-smp (depends on processor once again)
[09:47] <jair> hello guys, I have a machine running a machine with 4GB of ram
[09:47] <blue-frog> h0ndaracer2: cd Photoshop\ CS2
[09:47] <fangorious> what file sets the X keyboard settings?
[09:47] <aum> jair: lucky you :)
[09:47] <jair> how can i make the ubuntu show the 4GB of ram on the laptop
[09:47] <swanfl> I was looking through adept and don't see any references to a 2.6x kernel that has smp
[09:47] <h0ndaracer2> u put a slash for spaces that i didnt know
[09:47] <kaflan> n2diy, u talk about Keyboard shortcuts?
[09:47] <swanfl> some 2.4, but no 2.6
[09:47] <h0ndaracer2> thanks
[09:47] <blue-frog> h0ndaracer2: and don't forget the complete path to his folder as well
[09:47] <con-man> if my system is hard locking at random, what logs shoud I be looking at>
[09:47] <con-man> ?
[09:48] <leafw_> question on powerpc: how to update the ethernet driver? It does not support gigabit switches!
[09:48] <fkumro> swanfl, I also read that the generic kernel might have smp support built in, didnt read too much into it so dont quote me
[09:48] <rjg_> hello
[09:48] <leafw_> swanfl : you can choose to install an smp kernel from synaptic.
[09:48] <swanfl> never mind I'll rebuild the kernel myself
[09:48] <swanfl> thanks anyway
[09:48] <jair> there is a kernel for ubuntu that reads 4GB of ram?
[09:48] <max1> HuibertGill: I typed sudo kill 6207 but when reentering ps ax they are still there?
[09:48] <n2diy> kaflan, no switching keyboards with an alt key. You have to have two layouts installed, and then you can select how to switch them in layout options.
[09:49] <leafw_> jair : for 64-bit, I bet
[09:49] <psyber> is anyone in here familiar with ndiswrapper?
[09:49] <con-man> ?
[09:49] <con-man> if my system is hard locking at random, what logs shoud I be looking at>
[09:49] <LjL> "fsck has died with exit status 1", after an unclean reboot, on my home partition. the fsck output itself looks OK to me, it scanned up to 100% and then gave its normal report... should i worry? or does fsck just exit with 1 (and upstart reports that) when errors have been corrected?
[09:49] <rjg_> Does anyone know of any good alternatives to using nautilus as a file manger & browser? Or of a way of giving it a theme differnt than everthing else?
[09:49] <HuibertGill> max1: escalate the kills: "kill -9 PID" "kill -5 PID", you bash'em until they die :)
[09:49] <leafw_> rjg_ : try konqueror.
[09:49] <LjL> con-man: i think you should be checking your RAM using memtest, for starters. then, well, /var/log/messages, /var/log/kern.log... well, a few i guess
[09:50] <thidr0> real quick question, how can I see what version of Ubuntu I'm using?
[09:50] <jrib> LjL: no idea, but man fsck explains   1    - File system errors corrected
[09:50] <con-man> LjL: afaik my memory is good, but ill try again
[09:50] <_quip> hi
[09:50] <LjL> thidr0: lsb_release -a
[09:50] <_quip> i need some help.. :|
[09:50] <thidr0> ty
[09:50] <kaflan> n2diy, i have 2 layouts installed but where is 'layout options'?
[09:50] <djmccormick> i'm doing: ssh -o ServerAliveInterval 300 djmccormick@somehost.com and i get: command-line line 0: missing time value.
[09:50] <_quip> when i go through the install.. it says that it can't find my hard drive device..
[09:50] <djmccormick> how do i supply that time interval?
[09:50] <_quip> and it won't let me set ANY sort of partitions on it
[09:50] <psyber> is anyone in here familiar with ndiswrapper in here?
[09:50] <h0ndaracer2> look it still doesnt work d Photoshop\CS2bash: cd: PhotoshopCS2: No such file or directory
[09:50] <leafw_> thidr0 : check the /etc/apt/sources and read the name of the repositories.
[09:50] <_quip> i have a SATA2 so i don't know why it ain't working..
[09:51] <vermoos> anyone know how to send a file to a mac on a LAN? scp?
[09:51] <jair> leafw_: but I am using a 32 bit processor machine
[09:51] <LjL> jrib: ah thanks, that does sound like it's just upstart being particularly meticulous in reporting that (or... perhaps it's always been reported but i just never noticed ;)
[09:51] <thidr0> psyber: i just setup and used ndiswrapper
[09:51] <leafw_> vermoos : scp will do
[09:51] <n2diy> Kaflan, click on system, then prefrences, then keyboard, and layout options is one of the tabs.
[09:51] <blue-frog> h0ndaracer2: read and mind the typo...
[09:51] <h0ndaracer2> and im typing everything write and i know its case sensative
[09:51] <rjg_> konqueuer..anything else?
[09:51] <leafw_> jair : then no clue. Probably not supported.
[09:51] <Lunis> PriceChild: looks like it's a known bug :) there's no way (currently) to set what the keys control. thanks again for the help though
[09:51] <fangorious> vermoos: or nfs, or smb, or afp, or webdav
[09:51] <leafw_> jair : check the linux kernel forums.
[09:51] <vermoos> leafw_: scp origin destination is easy - how do i find the url for origin?
[09:51] <psyber> third did your wireless connection disapear from the network box?
[09:51] <PriceChild> Lunis: i'm sure you'll live :)
[09:52] <max1> HuibertGill: it worked when i killed them, do you have any idea why this happened? and what does the -9 stand for ? thx a lot!
[09:52] <leafw_> vermoos :   scp this/file mylogin@1.2.3.4:~/that/file
[09:52] <fangorious> rjg_: i've heard of thunar from xfce
[09:52] <Lunis> PriceChild: either that or i will hack something together :P
[09:52] <h0ndaracer2> what do u put on the command line to represent a space
[09:52] <PriceChild> Lunis: hehe :) good luck
[09:52] <leafw_> h0ndaracer2 : escape it with \
[09:52] <rjg_> ok...Konquere require the whole KDE deskop to be installed...
[09:52] <vermoos> leafw_: mylogin is a mac, and he has to use a gui!
[09:52] <kaflan> n2diy, click on system is in KDE menu?
[09:52] <thidr0> psyber: I'm not sure what you mean. After I installed ndiswrapper-utils (using the Synaptic Package Manager), it allowed me to install my wireless driver
[09:52] <fangorious> rjg_: shouldn't need the whole DE
[09:52] <h0ndaracer2> \ i do that and it still shows it as unable to open
[09:52] <LjL> jrib: was it you anyway you recalled (didn't, actually) some mnemonics for remembering SysRq keys?
[09:52] <aphelion_> Does anyone have experience with PulseAudio?
[09:52] <thidr0> it showed up after that
[09:52] <psyber> ok
[09:52] <Lunar_Lamp> <h0ndaracer2> what do u put on the command line to represent a space <== I'm confused, you just type a " " and that is a space...
[09:53] <vermoos> leafw_: but if i can find the url for mylogin... i can prove the uselessness of guis :)
[09:53] <thidr0> in the network box
[09:53] <fangorious> rjg_: just a bunch of the core libs
[09:53] <leafw_> vermoos : tell him to open the Terminal.app from /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app in the mac
[09:53] <n2diy> Kaflan, ah ha, your running KDE, and I'm running Gnome.
[09:53] <jrib> LjL: raising skinny elephants is utterly boring
[09:53] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[09:53] <psyber> hummm mine is in the network box... before installing the drivers... but it is not working
[09:53] <h0ndaracer2> " so this is a space
[09:53] <thidr0> Lunar_Lamp: like this /Desktop/My\ Home/
[09:53] <leafw_> vermoos : from a macosx terminal, ifconfig en0  will tell you the ip
[09:53] <HuibertGill> max1: for -9, -5, -15 goodnes, "man kill", the other process might be left from another upgrade/intall, maybe someone else is fiddling with the server you don't know about
[09:53] <_quip> i can't seem to install ubuntu.. for some reason when it tries to search for my devices.. it doesn't see my harddrive.. and it's a SATA2 drive.. i can't even set up partitions to install it.. the only option i have is "Manually Edit Partition Tables" but i can't even see the device..can anyone help me with my problem?
[09:53] <PriceChild> h0ndaracer2: you can also put quotations around the whole thing like I originally suggested
[09:53] <LjL> jrib: right, i would have needed that now, i think. well, the keys for "sync" would probably have been good enough ;-) on another note, don't try to set OpenGL games to SCHED_RR priority :D
[09:53] <aphelion_> If anyone here knows something about pulseaudio, please msg me :)
[09:53] <rjg_> fangorius: but wouldn't I be running KDE them?
[09:53] <djmccormick> i'm doing: ssh -o ServerAliveInterval 300 djmccormick@somehost.com and i get: command-line line 0: missing time value. where do i supply the time value?
[09:53] <Lunar_Lamp> thidr0, oh, right, sorry, I joined halfway through and didn't realise. It makes sense what he was asking now ;-)
[09:54] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[09:54] <brainiacTLB> i keep getting http://rafb.net/paste/results/uMAwVA10.html when compiling something
[09:54] <dromer> aaarg, I installed my printer (an ancient Deskjet 690c) and it just splurts out 1 line of 'stuff' and then gets all the paper
[09:54] <brainiacTLB> io.h missing
[09:54] <HuibertGill> max1: take a look in the logs in /var/log for suspicous access if you are 100% sure, you did not start a previous apt-get install without completing it....
[09:54] <FifaFrazer> Now I have updated gpsim to the newest version, reinstalled ktachlab, but there are still no PICs in the components list.. Anyone else having this problem?
[09:54] <kaflan> n2diy, difference between  gnome and kde in shortcuts seems to big :(
[09:54] <accept> what is the real name, the word that you'd type in terminal to start the sound recorder?
[09:54] <h0ndaracer2> when i do " i get  this what does it mean >
[09:54] <fangorious> vermoos: the other person using windows? you can enable windows sharing and the orther person can just browse to your share
[09:54] <leafw_> question: how to update the ethernet driver? Is it bundled to the kernel itself?
[09:54] <h0ndaracer2> and thats all it shows
[09:55] <malt> does ubuntu server have any default programs to block a ip address?
[09:55] <n2diy> Kaflan, I don't know, haven't played with KDE with Ubuntu.
[09:55] <malt> like already installed
[09:55] <leafw_> malt : type firewall in the search box of synaptic
[09:55] <leafw_> malt : or in apt-cache search
[09:55] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: you must close the "string" weithan " at the end
[09:55] <h0ndaracer2> ok ic
[09:56] <Megaqwerty> how do I make it so that I can switch my keyboard between multiple languages?
[09:56] <Megaqwerty> (English and Hebrew)
[09:56] <leafw_> Megaqwerty : in KDE is easy, in gnome it's rather obscure, you have to do it from System/Preferences/Keyboard menu every time
[09:57] <Megaqwerty> so I see....
[09:57] <h0ndaracer2> now in that folder i got a icon that says setup.exe do i type this in command line ./setup.exe
[09:57] <Megaqwerty> okay, thanks
[09:57] <thidr0> Megaqwerty: I think i saw somewhere you can put an Icon in the upper right, but that might just be languages
[09:57] <kaflan> leafw_, lol u wrong
[09:57] <kaflan> its not easy in KDE
[09:58] <blue-frog> max1: you are still with your lock error?
[09:58] <kaflan> i try to do layout switching very long time but with partial result
[09:58] <leafw_> kaflan : I switch from spanish to english keyboard layout all the time, with a kde applet
[09:58] <h0ndaracer2> what do i do to run setup.exe
[09:58] <kaflan> by alt+shift?
[09:58] <h0ndaracer2> do i use wine again

[10:00] <noelferreira> sprr not only i need to save an image of a card registration and the fields empty
[10:00] <WizCraker> Flannel: yes.

[10:01] <dromer> thidr0: I'm having probs since 2 days
[10:01] <kaflan> so any1 advice to switch layouts by alt+shift combination in KDE?
[10:01] <blue-frog> max1: next time you can also use    sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[10:01] <dromer> it says there is no new mail, but I know there is :/
[10:01] <fangorious> how do I resolve the conflict of X keyboard settings and GNOME keyboard settings (pc101.us vs pc104.us)? (how do I set them to be the same, so i don't get a warning every time i log in?)
[10:01] <Megaqwerty> leafw_: do you have any idea how I would type in a different language in GNOME?
[10:01] <HuibertGill> blue-frog: yeah, I didn't think of that one....
[10:02] <kkerwin> Hi. Is SMP enabled by default in Ubuntu's kernel, or do I need to custom compile one myself from source?
[10:02] <thidr0> dromer: well i can't even connect to the pop server
[10:02] <max1> blue-frog: and what does that do?
[10:02] <h0ndaracer2> it said i need active x and i went to download it but its doing nothing what do i do
[10:02] <blue-frog> max1: tells you if a programm uses this file
[10:02] <kitche> kkerwin: by default
[10:02] <kkerwin> kitche: Thanks.
[10:02] <fangorious> kkerwin: run uname -a, if it says "SMP" you have it
[10:02] <h0ndaracer2> how can i get active x
[10:02] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: I'm not sure photoshop works in wine, did you check?
[10:03] <dromer> thidr0: I think it is kind of resolved now, I use thunderbird btw, have you ever gotten it to werk ?
[10:03] <kkerwin> fangorious: Thank you, also.
[10:03] <blue-frog> max1: but don't forget the sudo otherwise it will say that nothing uses the file
[10:03] <kitche> kkerwin: you can find out by cat /proc/cpuinfo if it sees more then one processor
[10:03] <h0ndaracer2> im using itnow and wait one sec
[10:03] <leafw_> Megaqwerty : yes, System/Preferences/Keyboard Layout
=== DreamThief is now known as DreamThief|off
[10:03] <thidr0> dromer: i haven't tried thunderbird, only evolution. I'm working on a solution atm
[10:03] <max1> blue-frog: ok thx , I learned a lot using this channel: i'm setting up the server to practice for my school (evening lessons)
[10:03] <dromer> thidr0: but, has it worked before?
[10:03] <Megaqwerty> leafw_: I did, I chose "Hebrew Phonetic" and then tried typing, and it's still in english
[10:03] <thidr0> dromer: nope
[10:03] <h0ndaracer2> how can i get active x on here
[10:03] <dromer> can anybody help me with my printing prob?
[10:03] <Hellevator> Can anyone tell me if gnomebaker can burn .img files?
[10:03] <leafw_> Megaqwerty : then file in a bug to the gnome bugzilla
[10:04] <Megaqwerty> k
[10:04] <Megaqwerty> thx
[10:04] <thidr0> dromer:haven't tried it till now
[10:04] <dromer> thidr0: ok, have you set-up you gmailaccount ?
[10:04] <thidr0> dromer: yes
[10:04] <dromer> hmm
[10:04] <Khaaaaan> Active X?
[10:04] <dromer> gl then
[10:04] <Khaaaaan> Wine
[10:04] <fangorious> Hellevator: are they ISO9660 images with a .img extension instead of .iso?
[10:04] <thidr0> dromer: the strange thing is that I can connect to the smtp server but not the pop server
[10:04] <Hellevator> In gnomebaker when I selected burn dvd image and then selected the .img file gnomebaker told me that it is not a dvd image.
[10:04] <dromer> weird
[10:05] <Hellevator> fangorious, I'm not sure, I know its a dvd movie.
[10:05] <h0ndaracer2> ?
[10:05] <blue-frog> h0ndaracer2: follow the documentation on winehq.org or give a go at the Gimp. I think the Gimp would be better to learn than trying desperately to have photoshop

[10:05] <kkerwin> Hmm. I have kernel-2.6.17 installed, but the only headers that I can find in ubuntu's apt repository are 2.4.27. Do I need 2.6 headers? Will 2.4 work? If I need 2.6, where can I get them?
[10:05] <fangorious> Hellevator: how was it created?
[10:05] <Sp4rKy> can i set an empty password for a user ?
[10:05] <fangorious> kkerwin: try kernel-headers-$(uname -r)
[10:05] <Hellevator> fangorious, I didn't create it so I'm not sure

[10:06] <Sp4rKy> blue-frog: i've just seen :p thanks !
[10:06] <fangorious> Hellevator: did the provider of the file also give and md5 checksum so you can verify the file isn't corrupt?
[10:06] <fangorious> Hellevator: (by running 'md5sum file.img' to compare)
[10:06] <kkerwin> fangorious: apt couldn't find 2.6.17-10-generic
[10:07] <Hellevator> no they didn't
[10:07] <dpack> hi. does anyone know of an app (main, universe or multiverse) I can use to keep track of time on assignments? I'm a freelance consultant, and I figure there has to be a better way than doing time tracking manually.
[10:07] <psyber> anyone here have any idea why the command ndiswrapper -l  wont work?  And yes ndiswrapper is installed
[10:07] <blue-frog> kkerwin: you want the kernel headers to recompile the kernel?
[10:07] <fangorious> Hellevator: can you play the file in something like vlc?
[10:07] <kkerwin> blue-frog: To compile a module for the kernel that isn't in the kernel source tree.
[10:07] <thidr0> dromer: i figured it out. It was a problem in my pop settings
[10:07] <Sp4rKy> blue-frog: hmm, passwd -d seems disable login for the user
[10:08] <kitche> psyber: what does it say ndiswrapper command not found?
[10:08] <psyber> yes
[10:08] <dromer> haha, ok :)
[10:08] <Sp4rKy> blue-frog: i want an auto connexion (like the anonymous user)
[10:08] <thidr0> psyber: how did you install ndiswrapper?
[10:08] <Hellevator> fangorious, yes, the .img plays in vlc
[10:08] <blue-frog> Sp4rKy: afaik linux doesn't allow passwdless login
[10:08] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: have you read this? http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=2631
[10:08] <rjg_> does anyone know of a way of making one app a different theme from the rest(without themeing supoort)?
[10:08] <Sp4rKy> blue-frog: and for anonymous ?
[10:08] <psyber> sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper
[10:08] <Gosha> eh.. now it seems more like it's both going xubuntu, and what was there before
[10:08] <blue-frog> Sp4rKy: then you do it but with a passwd
[10:08] <Gosha> .. the ram usage is like .. *checks*
[10:08] <Gosha> 313 mb
[10:08] <thidr0> psyber: you have to install ndiswrapper-utils as well
[10:09] <psyber> yea I did that too sorry
[10:09] <thidr0> and the linux headers
[10:09] <Sp4rKy> blue-frog: vsftpd allow anonymous user login without password
[10:09] <Gosha> something tells me i have to do something funny
[10:09] <Gosha> the question is what :d
[10:09] <Gosha> :D*
[10:09] <h0ndaracer2> 404 error on that link
[10:09] <blue-frog> Sp4rKy: not getting what you want to do... you want to log on ftp server on in linux gnome session?
[10:10] <Sp4rKy> blue-frog: in ftp server in fact
[10:10] <Gosha> hmm... how do i uninstall xubuntu ? :D
[10:10] <Sp4rKy> but not with default anonymous login
[10:10] <Gosha> (installed it with apt-get)
[10:10] <Hellevator> fangorious, I am going to boot into kde and use k3b. someone said that they can handle .img files just fine.
[10:10] <pianoboy3333> crimsun_: thanks, works fine
[10:10] <thidr0> psyber: go into your Synaptic Package Manager and search ndiswrapper and make sure they're installed
[10:10] <aphelion_> sudo apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop?"
[10:10] <kitche> Gosha: sudo apt-get --purge remove xfce xubuntu-desktop is just a meta package
[10:10] <psyber> here are the commands I have done
[10:10] <psyber>  sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
[10:10] <psyber> sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils-1.8 sudo rm /usr/sbin/ndiswrapper sudo ln -s /usr/sbin/ndiswrapper-1.8 /usr/sbin/ndiswrapper
[10:11] <Gosha> with the is just a meta package?
[10:11] <abarbaccia> hey all - what state do you shut down to when you want to use wake on lan?
[10:11] <aphelion_> Anyone has experience with PulseAudio?
[10:11] <fangorious> Hellevator: i've never tried to burn a dvd image to disc, so i can't think of anything else
[10:11] <blue-frog> Sp4rKy: you have to fiddle with vsftp config then (sorry don't know more), as for pwd less login in linux there must be a line somwhere in configuration to allow it in fact
[10:11] <sltgroove> STR me thinks
[10:11] <leafw_> !backports
[10:11] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[10:11] <Sp4rKy> blue-frog: ok i'll try , thx
[10:11] <Gosha> E: Couldn't find package xfce :D
[10:11] <Hellevator> fangorious, np. Thanks for your help.
[10:12] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: try again, other wise search in the App DB at winehq.org:  http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=2631
[10:12] <thidr0> psyber: I'm trying to remember what I did. I remember https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper was helpful
[10:12] <dromer> aaarg: Unable to create the Foomatic driver [HP-DeskJet_690C,hpijs] . Either that driver does not exist, or you don't have the required permissions to perform that operation.
[10:13] <Exaura> hey can anyone tell me why i dont have a /etc/inittab ?
[10:13] <thidr0> psyber: yeah, follow the instructions on that page. It should help
[10:13] <crimsun_> Exaura: because you installed Edgy afresh and didn't dist-upgrade, and Edgy uses upstart.
[10:13] <HuibertGill> Exaura: are you running edgy?
[10:13] <psyber> thanks third... what I think I would like to do is uninstall of the ndiswrapper and startover
[10:13] <h0ndaracer2> why dont this work
[10:13] <Exaura> how can i stop x from starting up then?
[10:13] <h0ndaracer2> nm
[10:13] <psyber> any ideas how to remove all of the stuff I have already done?
=== robert_|food is now known as robert_
[10:14] <Exaura> cos i need to install graphics drivers or can i not do that?
[10:14] <psyber> stop x from starting by changing the run level to 3... atleast that is how you do it in fadora
[10:14] <ed__> hi im having trouble setting up mysql server for mythtv, ive ticked off 'complete removal' for all the mysql packages and then reinstalled them (including mysql-server), yet for some reason i dont have a /etc/mysql/my.cnf
[10:14] <thidr0> psyber: you can do it in the Synaptic Package Manager =D
[10:14] <ed__> anyone know what i should do?
[10:14] <LuisMendes> Where can I get Dapper's startup sound? (I'm on Edgy)
[10:14] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: afaik only photoshop <7 work sin wine, you might want to look into crossover office (comercial, but has a trial verasion)
[10:14] <psyber> I tried that I did not see it in Synaptic
[10:15] <h0ndaracer2> forget it wats something similar i can use on linux thats like adobe
[10:15] <narvik86> abarbaccia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN
[10:15] <h0ndaracer2> thats good
[10:15] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: but as other have said, it might be easier/better to look into the packages ubuntu provides directly
[10:15] <Gosha> eh
[10:15] <psyber> lol NM silly me
[10:15] <h0ndaracer2> like what are good ones ubuntu provides
[10:16] <Gosha> .. gah, how do i install it now? >_< .. what was that other apt thing someone mentioned?
[10:16] <h0ndaracer2> i see their are a few what do you think the best it
[10:16] <h0ndaracer2> is
[10:16] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: brb, getting a link for linux apps
[10:16] <sushi_> Different people keep trying to VNC me.  How are they portscanning me?  How can I stop them?  Thanks
[10:16] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[10:16] <masura> i would like to cry
[10:16] <Exaura> crimsun_: how can i stop x from loading up on startup then?
[10:16] <WizCraker> Flannel: yes, I have libapache2-mod-php5 on the server.
[10:16] <psyber> exaura... look up seting the runlevel
[10:16] <EdLin> sushi_: set up a firewall with iptables, or use a front-end that does the same.
[10:16] <Exaura> psyber: i dont have an inittab
[10:17] <Flannel> WizCraker: and, you have it enabled? (a symlink to php5.load and php5.conf is in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/)
=== cappiz is now known as captus
[10:17] <sushi_> EdLin: I have firestarter, which shows me all the blocked attempts, but I am wondering how they even knew I have VNC going in the first place
[10:17] <crimsun_> Exaura: change /etc/X11/default-display-manager
[10:18] <EdLin> sushi_: they don't - with a botnet the entire ipv4 address space can be scanned.
[10:18] <Exaura> crimsun_: to what?
[10:18] <crimsun_> Exaura: anything but its current value
[10:18] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: sorry, simpy.com (my bookmar manager) is down atm, I only have a bookmarl backup at work.......
=== chorse_ is now known as chorse
[10:18] <thidr0> psyber: to also make sure you've uninstalled everything, see this page: http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Uninstall
[10:18] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: so I can't find the link atm
[10:18] <sushi_> EdLin: How would I scan myself like that?
[10:18] <louie`> How do I find the sessions whitout X?
[10:19] <EdLin> sushi_: port scanning software and a network of rootkitted comprimized machines.
[10:19] <Exaura> crimsun_: thanks
[10:19] <Flannel> louie`: you mean the ttys?  ctrl-alt-f(1-6)
[10:20] <EdLin> sushi_: nmap is port-scanning software - it's white-hat use is to use a different computer, then scan your system to see what ports are open.
[10:20] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: huuhuu! start compaining and things get fixed automagically, here it is: http://www.physics.drexel.edu/liki/index.php/Equivalent_Windows_Applications
[10:20] <louie`> Flannel, I want to get to the sessions for programs that runs on startup
[10:20] <WizCraker> Flannel: nope.  no symlink... thanks for pointing that out to me.
[10:20] <louie`> But without X
[10:20] <[gen2] niki> can someone help me?
[10:20] <[gen2] niki> after i installed a upgrade for gnome few days ago
[10:21] <sushi_> edlin nmap <my ip?>
[10:21] <[gen2] niki> it takes terribly long to load after i login
[10:21] <[gen2] niki> (iam using xgl and beryl 0,3 newest nvidia betadrivers)
[10:21] <EdLin> sushi_: from a machine that isn't meant to have the access of course, doing it from your own machine won't work.
[10:21] <h0ndaracer2> is it ok if i use limewire
[10:21] <EdLin> (i.e. it will show all services running)
[10:21] <thidr0> use bittorrent!
[10:21] <h0ndaracer2> should i have some kind of virus protection
[10:21] <stoorty> is it possible to run an application from the cmd line?
[10:22] <stoorty> not an application
[10:22] <sushi_> EdLin Thanks
[10:22] <stoorty> a short cut even
[10:22] <EdLin> h0ndaracer2: Linux doesn't have viruses, it has other things you should look for.
[10:22] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: if you run apps in wine, some viruses for windows work :)
[10:22] <EdLin> h0ndaracer2: get chkrootkit and/or rkhunter to look for rootkits.
[10:22] <h0ndaracer2> is that it
[10:23] <filthpig> it DOES have viruses, but most of them are written for servers.
[10:23] <EdLin> h0ndaracer2: well, you want to follow security notices and apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade on a daily basis.
[10:23] <filthpig> and not desktops
[10:23] <h0ndaracer2> ok is that all i need to know to kept me safe
[10:23] <EdLin> filthpig: that's inaccurate.
[10:23] <EdLin> h0ndaracer2: no, also run a firewall.
[10:24] <h0ndaracer2> should i also do kernel upgrade
[10:24] <wyld> how do I change the color of the fonts on the app bar?
[10:24] <dpack> guys, I'm doing some research on Ubuntu and its relationship to its sponsor Canonical. Is there any way to distinguish between an Ubuntu developer employed by Canonical and a volunteer?
[10:24] <EdLin> h0ndaracer2: if the kernel has a security hole, yes, if it's a feature improvement, that's up to you.
[10:24] <Flamekebab> Can you guys assist me? I want to add to an image resizing script to create an option to stamp photos (with a logo)
[10:24] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: do whatever the auto updater tells you to :)
[10:24] <HuibertGill> dpack: money?
[10:24] <fangorious> dpack: ask them?
[10:24] <Flamekebab> the script uses Zenity
[10:25] <con-man> does anyone know how to make blue tooth turn off? my logs show that each time before my computer crashed it was accessing bluetooth. I have removed the bluetooth device but it is still happeneing
[10:25] <fangorious> Flamekebab: look at imagemagik
[10:25] <kitche> con-man: blacklist the module
[10:25] <Flamekebab> fangorious, the script is written already
[10:25] <Flamekebab> and I know vaguely what I need to add
[10:25] <con-man> kitche: how is that accomplished?
[10:25] <Flamekebab> but I'm not well versed in the ways of perl scripting
[10:26] <kitche> con-man: I m not very familiar with bluetooth but you can blacklist modules in /etc/module.d/blacklist
[10:26] <kitche> !blacklist|con-man
[10:26] <ubotu> con-man: To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add "blacklist modulename" to the end of that list
[10:26] <thidr0> what's the command to download a file from the internet? e.g. a png file
[10:26] <filthpig> wget "url"
[10:26] <thidr0> oh yea thx
=== Doodluv is now known as finnian
[10:27] <con-man> well it just accessed bluetooth per my logs and there was no crash, so i guess i was wrong
[10:27] <h0ndaracer2> what is a good firewall to run the ones ubuntu offer
[10:27] <h0ndaracer2> s
[10:27] <fangorious> h0ndaracer2: iptables
[10:27] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: install fdirestarter
[10:27] <narvik86> built it, iptables
[10:27] <HuibertGill> h0ndaracer2: firestarter
[10:28] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[10:28] <Vaske_Car> I downloaded .deb file of new Opera, how to upgrade it now?
[10:28] <h0ndaracer2> i install chkrootkit but i dont see it anywhere
[10:28] <kitche> h0ndaracer2: it's a command line tool run chkrootkit in a terminal/console
[10:29] <h0ndaracer2> ./ chkrootkit like that
[10:29] <kitche> h0ndaracer2: no just chkrootkit you don't need the ./
=== finnian is now known as Doodluv
[10:29] <EdLin> h0ndaracer2: or run it as a cron job, and have it mail you the output. (if you do that you probably want the -q option to shorten the email message)
[10:30] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[10:30] <GhostRidr> Hey, looking for the way to get a serial console going on 6.10
[10:30] <con-man> i think i might be having issues with nvidia, whenever i load a game, such as WoW, it crashes shortly after, however this did not happen with my previous ATI card. does anyone know where I should start with this issue?
[10:30] <EdLin> h0ndaracer2: in order to install it use symaptic or aptitude or apt-get
[10:30] <con-man> oh yes
[10:30] <con-man> #nvidia is not responding
[10:30] <Dot> hokay, someone know anything about audacity
[10:30] <GhostRidr> Since there isn't a /etc/inittab I'm having trouble
[10:30] <Dot> hokay, someone know anything about audacity
=== Dot is now known as fgsfds
[10:31] <con-man> !nvidia
[10:31] <Music_Shuffle> What about it?
[10:31] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:31] <captus> this is kind of-topic... but does anyone know how many IPs you can have for x (192.168.1.x) ?
[10:31] <Vaske_Car> How to upgrade Opera? Do I need to remove old version first or I can just install over it?
[10:31] <captus> 255 or 256?
[10:31] <Cyrus25801> hi
[10:31] <fangorious> captus: 0-255
[10:31] <captus> so
[10:31] <fgsfds> when i press record again after recording track one, the second track is in like slo mo
[10:31] <captus> 256
[10:31] <captus> ?
[10:31] <Music_Shuffle> 256*
[10:31] <Music_Shuffle> yeah.
[10:31] <captus> thanks :)
[10:31] <Cyrus25801> anyone know XGL
[10:31] <fgsfds> when i press record again after recording track one, the second track is in like slo mo
[10:31] <captus> so 255 is valid... :)
[10:31] <captus> didnt think of it
[10:31] <GhostRidr> if you have a netmask of 255.255.255.0 you have 1-254 usable address
[10:31] <Music_Shuffle> Stop repeating!
[10:32] <fgsfds> answer
[10:32] <kitche> captus: 255 is usually for broadcast
[10:32] <Music_Shuffle> We can read.
[10:32] <h0ndaracer2> how often should i do chkrootkit i mean run it?
[10:32] <captus> ah ok :) GhostRidr
[10:32] <fgsfds> the forums suck
[10:32] <captus> yeah but its a valid in the IP "world"
[10:32] <Cyrus25801> hi, anyone know XGL
[10:32] <bigfuzzyjesus> do nit
[10:32] <fangorious> Cyrus25801: you probably want to look in #ubuntu-xgl, or #beryl
[10:32] <killermach> fgsfds: no..  the posters suck
[10:32] <captus> its like 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

[10:33] <captus> ?
[10:33] <fgsfds> i have been bumping me thread for like a day now and no responce, but can i get some help here
[10:33] <captus> where 11111111 = 255
[10:33] <EdLin> the forums are good for searching through, ocassionally they have the answer.
[10:33] <Cyrus25801> -fangorious do i need to install ubuntu again if i want to use xgl
[10:33] <Music_Shuffle> If you were...patient, most likely? Lol
[10:33] <captus> but its from 0-255 not 1-255
[10:33] <h0ndaracer2> thanks for help everyone
[10:33] <fgsfds> heloooooooooooooooooo
[10:33] <killermach> fgsfds: if people would go back and post whether they have fixed it and if the info posted was the fix. it would be much better
[10:33] <leafw_> any idea why edgy-ppc would not DHCPDISCOVER a gigabit switch?
[10:33] <fangorious> fgsfds: maybe nobody reading that forum knows the answer. does audacity have it's own dedicated forum or irc channel?
[10:33] <WizCraker> Flannel: Thanks for the help.. php finnally works.
[10:33] <fgsfds> idk
[10:34] <Cyrus25801> -fangorious do i need to install ubuntu again if i want to use xgl
[10:34] <killermach> fgsfds: but people seem to be either selfish or just don't recognize their problem could help someone
[10:34] <fangorious> Cyrus25801: you should be able to install xserver-xgl with the default repos for both 6.06 and 6.10
[10:34] <fgsfds> ya tell me about it
[10:34] <killermach> fgsfds: don't ask to ask.. just ask
[10:34] <con-man> I HATE intermittent issues. so hard to recreate the problem
[10:34] <Cyrus25801> -fangorious i have installed it. how do i run it
[10:35] <GhostRidr> anybody know how to enable a serial console on ttyS0 for Edgy?  I can get the ouput, but no login prompt
[10:35] <fgsfds> im gonna find audacity irc
[10:35] <con-man> join #mp3
[10:35] <stoorty> !sudo
[10:35] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:37] <fangorious> Cyrus25801: you need to add a script to start it, and then a session .desktop file that launches that script on login
[10:37] <fangorious> Cyrus25801: look at the beryl-project.org wiki for examples
[10:38] <Cyrus25801> -fangorious thanx
[10:38] <stoorty> is there a way to make a shortcut for an application run as root?
[10:38] <dromer> printing wizard says there are no drivers, but foomatic is installed properly
[10:39] <leafw_> any idea why edgy-ppc would not DHCPDISCOVER a gigabit switch?
[10:39] <Flannel> WizCraker: actually, the correct method is using "a2enmod" (apache2 ENable MODule) instead of just symlinking, but no big deal.

[10:40] <Gosha> or wait .. i'll just try out
[10:40] <Shaba1-AFK> rather making a machine check for a dhcp server and then getting its configuration from that
[10:40] <Flannel> stoorty: put "gksudo" infront of the command
[10:41] <Gosha> .. appereantly not
[10:41] <dromer> YES !!! SUCCES !!! \o/

[10:46] <blue-frog> lasse_ chapter 1 that is
[10:46] <wildchild> where is xsession, I have to add lines like killall jackd & jackd -d alsa, so jack will automaticall run and kill
[10:46] <lasse_> blue-frog: i discovered that :D. thx
[10:47] <mattl> hey, have you all seen jono's blog entry?
[10:47] <blue-frog> jono's right in my opinion
[10:47] <bigfuzzyjesus> how do i update my applications menu, appfinder shows all my apps but my menu doesnt
[10:47] <fangorious> jono?
[10:47] <ryanakca> x includes are provided by xlibs-dev, correct?
[10:47] <mattl> blue-frog, do you care about freedom?
[10:47] <con-man> can someone help me?  Ive been having a horrible time with random crashes, which ive narrowed down to having something to do with sound.  The issue has not happened since ive disabled onboard audio on the mobo.  So.  My question: are there any know issues with ALSA/OSS or sound in general that would cause a computer to hard lock?
[10:47] <fangorious> bigfuzzyjesus: System->Preferences->Menu
[10:47] <con-man> dfsad
[10:48] <kitche> ryanakca: you probably want xserver-xorg-dev
[10:48] <fangorious> bigfuzzyjesus: or something resembling that, don't have ubuntu booted right now
[10:48] <Clarrisa_2008> fanorious, ty.... which group and which owner needs to own the files in my /var/www folder in order for apache to use them correctly?
[10:48] <bigfuzzyjesus> fangorious, im on xubuntu
[10:48] <fangorious> bigfuzzyjesus: oh, don't know then, sorry
[10:48] <blue-frog> mattl: jono's said it all so talking about it for me would be simple as quoting him so better read the stuff again..
[10:48] <ryanakca> kitche: erm... I'm packaging solseek: checking for X... configure: error: Can't find X includes. Please check your installation and add the correct paths!
[10:48] <bigfuzzyjesus> fangorious, its ok
[10:49] <mattl> blue-frog, it's a fairly simple question. do you, personally, care about freedom?
[10:49] <kitche> ryanakca: xlibs-dev will only install the include files for the X libs
[10:49] <ryanakca> kitche: which is what I want, thanks
[10:49] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: whatever apache runs as. seems odd that the package didn't set that up for you. did you install it using apt-get from the ubuntu repos?
[10:49] <blue-frog> mattl: if freedom means leaving in wooden cabin with nothing, no... and I won't troll anymore on the subject
[10:49] <kitche> ryanakca: but that's not the X include files it's just for x libs include files
[10:50] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, for some reason a while back I created a user called apachegroup, I think intending for that group to help facilitate apache's needs... but I don't know how apache is supposed to be "aware" of that group, is apache supposed to be a member of that group?
[10:50] <khaladan> hey, what package(s) should i install if i want X, Gnome, etc?
[10:50] <ryanakca> kitche: kk
[10:50] <mattl> blue-frog, i don't understand what 'leaving in wooden cabin with nothing' means? i presume you mean living, but i don't see the relevance?
[10:50] <Music_Shuffle> !offtopic
[10:50] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[10:50] <Clarrisa_2008> I am pretty sure I used apt-get, but since this is my first server I've been futzing with it quite a bit as I'm learning so who knows what else I did
[10:50] <blue-frog> mattl living indeed..
[10:50] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, I am pretty sure I used apt-get, but since this is my first server I've been futzing with it quite a bit as I'm learning so who knows what else I did
[10:50] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: the uid that the httpd process runs as would need to be a member of that group in order to read/write files owned by that group and without world read/write permission
[10:51] <mattl> blue-frog, but what does that mean? nobody's suggesting such a measure.
[10:51] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, how can I find the UID of the httpd process?
[10:51] <deep> exit
[10:52] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: the httpd.conf file (probably under somewhere under /etc) should say what user and group httpd runs as
[10:52] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, ok, checking...
[10:53] <SeamusLP> whats up guys
[10:53] <Music_Shuffle> Nm, you?
[10:53] <SeamusLP> just helping a friend of mine out with his install
[10:54] <SeamusLP> Anyone here have a dell inspiron 6000 ?  A friend is having some wireless issues in edgy
[10:54] <deleted> SeamusLP: do you know the chipset?
[10:54] <kitche> SeamusLP: the chipset of the wireless card would be good to know
[10:54] <SeamusLP> well the driver he's using is ipw2200
[10:54] <fangorious> SeamusLP: what's the problem?
[10:55] <kitche> SeamusLP: what's his wireless doing dropping on him every so often?
[10:55] <SeamusLP> No, it just isn't connecting to his access point
[10:55] <SeamusLP> the signal stays at 0 and jumps up to 100 every once in awhile
[10:55] <fangorious> SeamusLP: using wep/wpa[2] ?
[10:55] <SeamusLP> he's using WEP
[10:55] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, my httpd.conf file is located under /etc/apache2 and it's empty, except for a statement that says it's a placeholder... I'm using apache2
[10:55] <fangorious> SeamusLP: looked at network-manager?
[10:56] <SeamusLP> yeah, I told him to try configuring a static IP in network manager, no dice
[10:56] <kitche> SeamusLP: see what iwconfig is saying for his AP he might have to force the card to use his AP
[10:56] <fangorious> SeamusLP: network manager doesn't do static
=== mralphabet is now known as blahblahblahblah
[10:56] <SeamusLP> oh, THAT network manager
=== blahblahblahblah is now known as blahnick
[10:56] <pvf> oi oi ... i have ubuntu dapper here and i just want to upgrade some packages that are available in edgy...is it possible ?
[10:56] <SeamusLP> He hasn't attempted to use that
[10:57] <hilde> join#drupal-support
[10:57] <kitche> pvf: they might be in dapper-backports
[10:57] <fangorious> SeamusLP: might try using that, i haven't been able to manually configure my wlan (wpa2 personal) manually in a while, but nm works without error first time every time
[10:57] <TheVault> I need some help
[10:57] <charle97> hello
[10:57] <talbain> what are the backport-updates?
[10:58] <TheVault> Whats the best font configurations that you should do for Ubuntu?
[10:58] <kitche> !backports|talbain
[10:58] <ubotu> talbain: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[10:58] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: weird. if you start apache you could run 'ps aux | grep httpd' and the first column should be the username
[10:58] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, I have a folder called sites-available that has config files in it for each of my websites I've set up...   in each of these is that where I will find the owner reference..?
[10:58] <talbain> thanks
[10:58] <fangorious> TheVault: whatever you find the most aesthetically pleasing
[10:59] <TheVault> Well, the problem is that, in Firefox, all the links are different sizes
[10:59] <TheVault> And they are kinda annoying
[10:59] <TheVault> If you like, I can show you a screenshot of what im talking about
[10:59] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, when I tryped ps aux | grep httpd  It lists root as the first column.... that isn't good is it?
[11:00] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: presumably those would each be for a domain hosted by a single instance of the server, and there would be one master conf file that defines a bunch of globals and includes the domain-specific ones
[11:00] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: usually not suggested to run as root
[11:00] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, I am pretty sure someone instructed me to create this apachegroup for this purpose... I didn't do it right I don't think
[11:00] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, can I change it to the apachegroup?
[11:01] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: unfortunately i haven't maintained an apache install in a while, so i'm running on memory
[11:01] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: well each process has both a UID (user) and GID (group). You would need the user to be a member of the desired group, but could then have the process run with that GID
[11:01] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: that would be set in the top-level conf file
[11:01] <TheVault> Is it me, or in Firefox under the tools, there is no option menu?
[11:02] <fangorious> TheVault: Edit -> Preferences
[11:02] <TheVault> Whoa thanks a million!
[11:02] <TheVault> Iv been searching for that
[11:02] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, I have a file in sites-available called default, but I don't see a directive for user or group in it.
[11:02] <TheVault> In windows, its under tools
[11:03] <rcrook> its preferences under edit
[11:03] <TheVault> Thanks, I found it
[11:03] <flamekebab__> nick Flamekebab
[11:03] <fangorious> TheVault: yeah, i've no idea why they have it different, been that way ever since the netscape days
[11:03] <TheVault> Another question, is it me or does firefox show different sized fonts?
[11:03] <TheVault> Here, I will show you what I mean
[11:04] <rcrook> TheVault: it does and it irks me no end
=== cumcum82 is now known as panspermia
[11:04] <knapp> In amarok, how do you submit album covers to your ipod/media device? Anyone know?
[11:04] <TheVault> is there a cure for that or I mean a option to fix that?
[11:04] <Clarrisa_2008> fangorious, I am a member of the group apachegroup, if I could just figure out how to change the httpd process GID to apachegroup
[11:04] <TheVault> rcrook: show me what you see on Google.com
[11:04] <rcrook> not that I have found so far
[11:05] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: try 'locate httpd.conf'
[11:05] <flamekebab__> argh
[11:05] <rcrook> the fonts for the actual content are in the preferences but for the menus and dialog boxes I can not find
[11:05] <Flamekebab> ah
[11:05] <killermach> nothlit: while doing a text install from alternate CD, Ipartitioning the drive, it begins copying files, then after several minutes the screen goes black and I have 2 white rectangles similar to cursors
[11:05] <Flamekebab> forgot I had another instance running!
[11:06] <khaladan> hey, what package(s) should i install if i want X, Gnome, etc?
[11:06] <Flamekebab> anyway, quick question - how do I use the composite command in Imagemagick?
[11:06] <killermach> nothlit: but.. no mouse, no screen changes and CTRL+ALT+F1, F2, etc give no terminal
[11:06] <nothlit> killermach, wow, then maybe you should try the net install or minimal cd
[11:06] <TheVault> Alright, this is what Google & some of my screen looks like
[11:06] <TheVault> http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y28/kylewitt/VeryWeird.png
[11:06] <Clarrisa_2008> fangrious, when I open the file httpd.conf, in etc/apache2 it says: # This is here for backwards compatability reasons and to support
[11:06] <Clarrisa_2008> #  installing 3rd party modules directly via apxs2, rather than
[11:06] <Clarrisa_2008> #  through the /etc/apache2/mods-{available,enabled} mechanism.
[11:06] <nothlit> killermach, first order of business would be video lol
[11:06] <Music_Shuffle> What about it TheVault ?
[11:06] <Flamekebab> I want to composite a PNG and a JPG
[11:07] <killermach> nothlit: the hard drive light still flashes  and network hub shows activity for it, I guess it is installing from network
[11:07] <dromer> hmm, how can I find files ?
[11:07] <fangorious> Clarrisa_2008: hm, i guess I haven't administered an apache2 instance then
[11:07] <talbain> u have updates ready
[11:07] <talbain> ;)

[11:07] <Music_Shuffle> !beagle | dromer
[11:07] <TheVault> if you look on it, you will see the font and things are kinda hard to read and on the right of google where it says "Advanced Search" and things, its kinda smaller

[11:08] <cyphase> seems the Diva project has gone stale: http://www.diva-project.org/
[11:08] <TheVault> Then when I go to Photobucket.com, the fonts are all outta wack
[11:08] <nothlit> killermach, the alternate cd does everything from the disc though

[11:08] <Music_Shuffle> That.
[11:08] <cyphase> looks like the domain expired, and someone got it
[11:08] <rcrook> TheVault: you can change that in the preferences

[11:08] <nothlit> dromer, beagle is already in edgy eft
[11:08] <Kim^J> I don't want anything.
[11:08] <fangorious> TheVault: you could try a different font, or setting a min font size
[11:08] <Music_Shuffle> TheVault, it looks ok to me...so lost. >>

[11:08] <TheVault> What should I set the font & font size to then?
[11:09] <killermach> nothlit: hmm.. it did DHCP early in the install, and hass been causing activity for this computer on the network switch since it started copying files
[11:09] <fangorious> TheVault: experiment to see what you find optimal

[11:09] <Shaba1-AFK> here is another dumb question
[11:10] <Shaba1-AFK> what does sudo do?
[11:10] <TheVault> WTF no wonder
[11:10] <Music_Shuffle> !sudo

[11:10] <nefertum> hi, i've installed emacs21 and in the X11 version i saw some strange symbols
[11:10] <TheVault> what should I lower that to?
[11:10] <killermach> nothlit: well I still have HD and network activity.. but no response on the machine, guess I'll wait awhile
[11:10] <nefertum> anyone knows which one could be the problem in emacs?
[11:10] <vanberge> let me ask differently...  i have a windows ntfs drive attached as /dev/hdb1   how can i format/filesystem/mount that and use it?  is there a gui util or do i have to cfdisk and fstab ?
[11:10] <Shaba1-AFK> ok suppose I do not WANT users with that power
[11:10] <Flamekebab> can anyone assist me with composite?
[11:11] <Shaba1-AFK> right now the only superuser on my win2k network is me.
[11:11] <nothlit> dromer, it should be applications -> accessories -> search
[11:11] <Shaba1-AFK> I would like to keep it that way in linux
[11:11] <dromer> nothlit: oh sorry, I'm in kde ..

[11:17] <Music_Shuffle> I just can't set it up myself. But that's besides the point!
[11:17] <talbain> nevron: yeah, just ask
[11:17] <markvandenborre> ok, somewhat off topic, but...
[11:17] <youtubee> i think that needs to be a lot more stable...
[11:18] <DBO> nothlit, you can also use emerald instead, it doesnt matter much
[11:18] <nothlit> DBO, also do you know why the unstable branch of the repo is all compiz stuff?
[11:18] <markvandenborre> anyone here has a hint on a standalone scanner that I can use to send across the network
[11:18] <DBO> nothlit, once more with clarity?
[11:18] <markvandenborre> think of it as a reverse network printer :)
[11:18] <nevron> ok i have a dual head setup with merged fb it works fine when both go with 1024 768 resolutions but i can t make them work in 1280 1024 mode because one of the monitors do not work in 85 hz
[11:18] <nothlit> DBO, are they interchangeable? or do i have to purge one to use the other
[11:19] <Music_Shuffle> I can't get either to work, and it compulsively bothers me.
[11:19] <Music_Shuffle> Much much much.
[11:19] <naylor> hey can anyone please help me out?
[11:19] <nothlit> DBO, the ubuntu.beryl-project.com unstable, why is it all compiz stuff?
[11:19] <naylor> here's the problem

[11:20] <Rappermas> hey does anyone know how to get apache and php working together?
[11:20] <nothlit> DBO, are heliodor/emerald interchangeable? or do i have to purge one to use the other
[11:20] <Rappermas> i think that i have the necessary packages installed
[11:20] <nevron> ok no solution right_?
[11:20] <nevron> right
[11:20] <DBO> nothlit, interchangable
[11:20] <kitche> nevron: use xinerama
[11:20] <DBO> nevron, you need to set the refresh rates for both
[11:20] <nevron> no xinerama disabvles direct rendering i need it to run properly
[11:20] <nothlit> DBO, thanks a lot for your help :) sorry for inundating you with questions
[11:20] <DBO> nevron, you nee dthe sync ranges
[11:21] <nevron> i have some but they dont work
[11:21] <kitche> nevron: what card are you using ati?
[11:21] <nevron> they work only for 1024*768 both

[11:21] <naylor> http://pastebin.ca/284160   please if anyone can help that would be great, can't use some programs cos of this
[11:21] <Wiz> Anyone got a few seconds to help a complete beginner?
[11:21] <Music_Shuffle> !ask
[11:21] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:21] <Music_Shuffle> !anyone
[11:21] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[11:22] <vanberge> Wiz, probably...
[11:22] <killermach> nothlit: hmm.. press CTRL+ALT+F1 no.. response.. harddisk light flickered tho... so I pressed enter a two times and it rebooted, gave a grub menu, linux booted, no X, I did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and accepted all the defaults, restart gdm and I have a login and desktop.. :) thanks for your help
[11:22] <naylor> basically i was updating the graphics card, then i downgraded some stuff and must of broken something. can't use gtk progs now and this is the error: http://pastebin.ca/284160
[11:22] <kitche> nevron: ah ok hmm don't know then sicne I am an nvidia user
[11:22] <Music_Shuffle> naylor, why not just remove it, run synaptic and get it again?
[11:22] <nothlit> killermach, OMGS IT WORKED? congrats!
[11:22] <Rappermas> or at least how do i check that php is installed
[11:22] <naylor> what do i remove?
[11:23] <nothlit> killermach, you're a very patient man(or woman)
[11:23] <nevron> it is nothing to do with being an nvidia user it is about a setting in the xorg.conf
[11:23] <Wiz> Ok, just installed Ubuntu and now it tells me I've got software updates pending, when I try to run them it promts for password. I enter the current user password and it doesn't work...Then I enter root password, still the same thing...
[11:23] <max1> when typing exportfs -a to export my home folder i get this message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37826/
[11:23] <nothlit> killermach, lol why did you want to get it working so much?
[11:23] <killermach> nothlit: ick.. desktop is 640x480
[11:23] <Music_Shuffle> The current user pw should work...
[11:23] <Music_Shuffle> Unless you set a root password sep.
[11:23] <nothlit> !fixres | killermach
[11:23] <ubotu> killermach: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[11:23] <fangorious> naylor: try apt-get -f upgrade
[11:23] <killermach> nothlit: it's a gift to a friend
[11:23] <talbain> caps on?
[11:23] <Rappermas> i'll ask on the php channel
[11:23] <nothlit> killermach, ahh
[11:24] <Wiz> Have a separate root password..
[11:24] <nothlit> killermach, well then you're a very good friend
[11:24] <Wiz> Completely novice when it comes to linux though :-(
[11:24] <nevron> ok now can you tell me a setting for Hsync that will make both monitors go 1280*1024 at 60hz resulting in a 2560*1536 big desktop
[11:24] <Kim^J> /
[11:24] <fangorious> Wiz: the password you logged into your account with is what you should use. do you have cap lock on?
[11:25] <userundefine> Wiz, you set up an actual root account already while you're a novice?  If you just installed, the pw that you entered for your first user should work.
[11:25] <Jussi01> hei, got a small problem - is it usual for the xp pro setup in vmware to take hours to install devices.. its been sitting almost at the end for about 2 hours. do I have to be in the vmware session for it to go anywhere?
[11:25] <Music_Shuffle> Or if you typed it wrong, sometimes it refuses to reset your option to enter it without a reboot.
[11:25] <Music_Shuffle> At least of X.
[11:25] <userundefine> Jussi01, might be a bad disc.  I've never had that problem... VMware usually installs XP faster than typical XP in my experience
[11:25] <nothlit> !sudo > Wiz
[11:26] <Wiz> The error I get now is: Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic --update-at-startup --non-interactive --hide-main-windows as user root: Child terminated with 1 status
[11:26] <nevron> DBO at least can you tell me this if i set the Option "CRT2Hsync" "30-65" to read Option "CRT2Hsync" "60" will it solve my problem
[11:26] <max1> Jussi01: did you give the virtual machine enough hd space?
[11:26] <Jussi01> yeah 4gb
[11:26] <killermach> nothlit: can you be any other kind of friend?? :)
[11:26] <DBO> nevron, nope that isnt how it works
[11:26] <fangorious> Wiz: are you running from the command line or gui? to run something as root from the command line run it as 'sudo ...' instead of '...'
[11:27] <mralphabet> Jussi01: My xp vm install took less then an hour
[11:27] <DBO> nevron, you need to get the sync ranges for your monitor
[11:27] <psyber> grrrr anyone in here familiar with ndiswrapper?
[11:27] <Music_Shuffle> An hour?
[11:27] <Wiz> I'm lost :-)
[11:27] <nevron> ok how can i get them
[11:27] <Wiz> Same thing after sudo
[11:27] <fangorious> Wiz: how are you starting synaptic?
[11:27] <Jussi01> thanks... I might start again...
[11:27] <mralphabet> Jussi01: what kind of cpu / ram in the machine vs vm?
[11:27] <max1> please help: when typing exportfs -a to export my home folder i get this message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37826/
[11:27] <nevron> one of them is 17 inches and the other is 19 so thats the problem they are not identical
[11:27] <Wiz> fangorious, not sure :-/
[11:27] <Music_Shuffle> My 2.4 Northwood + 512 PC2100 can install XP in 30-ish.
[11:27] <Jussi01> 1.6 pentium m 512 ram
[11:28] <Music_Shuffle> If that.
[11:28] <nevron> but it works in windoze so i must be able to do it here too
[11:28] <Wiz> Just clicking on the "update icon" since it says 199 updates pending
[11:28] <Jussi01> vm 256 ram...not sure hat else
[11:28] <Music_Shuffle> And its nowhere near new, or quick-like.
[11:28] <Shaba1> Ok I just did a hd install ubuntu from a livecd
[11:28] <Shaba1> now
[11:28] <nothlit> killermach, well, theres plain, regular, average friends, and good and better friends, and best friends, but i'm afraid if i say any more i'll be told about offtopic
[11:28] <fangorious> Wiz: From the System -> Administration menu, or in a terminal (like a dos/cmd prompt in windows)?
[11:28] <Wiz> fangorious, terminal
[11:28] <mralphabet> Jussi01: that should be enough, 4gb of hd might be a little small for an xp install, but it shouldn't give you any problems like that
[11:28] <Shaba1> JUST to let all fo you know that I am going to be back here like day and night for the next two weeks getting this network set up
[11:29] <Music_Shuffle> 4? =/
[11:29] <psyber> is anyone in here familiar with ndiswrapper
[11:29] <fangorious> Wiz: so to run it as root, run 'sudo synaptic' then give it the password of your account
[11:29] <Flannel> fangorious: gksudo
[11:29] <Jussi01> mralphbet thanks - Im gonna try "reseting" the vm...
[11:29] <nevron> ok so DBO i will play with CRT2Hsync and CRT2VRefresh in the xorg settings is that true?
[11:29] <Jussi01> start again
[11:29] <Flannel> Wiz: gksudo synaptic, and actually, synaptic should be able to escilate on its own, but gksudo never hurt
[11:29] <fangorious> Flannel: if you want a gui password prompt
[11:30] <Flannel> fangorious: no.  For GUI programs, you use gksudo, not sudo.
[11:30] <nevron> !bump
[11:30] <killermach> nothlit: it is detecting i810 now, but the monitor seems to be the problem, not sure what to put for this LCD screen settings
[11:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bump - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:30] <Wiz> fangorious and Flannel, I'll try...just a sec
[11:30] <cafuego> Actually, for either you use whatever you like.
[11:30] <nothlit> killermach, did you go through the whole reconfiguring, theres a part about resolution
[11:31] <killermach> nothlit: well I'm way simpler than that.. I have two categories.. friends and associates
[11:31] <pvf> how do i install a bakcport
[11:31] <psyber> anyone know how to setup a wireless card?
[11:31] <kane77> hi... what is opposite of 'grep'?? something to filter results...
[11:31] <tuskernini> hi there all... does anyone know how to make a TORRENT file in ubuntu?
[11:31] <killermach> nothlit: well xp displays 1024x768x32bit, I expect the same in ubuntu :)
[11:32] <SeamusLP> pvf you ned to add the backport repository
[11:32] <fangorious> kane77: grep -v
[11:32] <clucas_> howdy all
[11:32] <meheren> is there a way to set up my usb flash to save all the settings and everything with my livecd? i don't have a hard drive, and want to use my livecd to boot with. My usb flash is not big enough to hold the entire os
[11:32] <pvf> SeamusLP, i already added
[11:32] <pvf> now what
[11:32] <Music_Shuffle> tuskernini, use the option given to on any of the major torrent clients?
[11:32] <nothlit> killermach, if dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg didn't work, use dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg
[11:32] <max1> please help: when typing exportfs -a to export my home folder i get this message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37826/
[11:32] <nothlit> meheren, change your home folder to a usb flash drive
[11:32] <SeamusLP> pvf you can search for the backport you want in synaptic or do sudo apt-get install packagename  from the command line
[11:33] <kane77> fangorious, thanx.. ;)
[11:33] <astroboy> find
[11:33] <killermach> nothlit: ok.. plow it is.. I'm wondering what to put in for Hsync and Vsync settings on this laptop LCD ..hmm
[11:33] <tuskernini> Music_Shuffle, i use bittornado... does not seem to have it... will have a look
[11:33] <clucas_> i could really use some help with my TiBook and the radeon card inside of it
[11:33] <kitche> meheren: the ubuntu livecd from my knowledge does not have that feature but Puppy does
[11:33] <nothlit> killermach, don't they have any sane defaults?
[11:33] <pvf> SeamusLP, but it says that the newest version is already installed
[11:33] <Music_Shuffle> Try kTorrent, rTorrent, uTorrent with WINE, Azureus perhaps.
[11:33] <psyber> can anyone in here give me a hand setting up my wireless card?
[11:33] <SeamusLP> pvf did you reload the package list, or do a sudo apt-get update ?
[11:33] <nothlit> kitche, he could manually remount a home folder to a flash drive by uuid
[11:33] <pvf> and i know that there is a newer version in edgy (i'm using drake)
[11:33] <talbain> meheren: try puppy linux or damn small linux
[11:34] <pvf> SeamusLP, yes
[11:34] <BlackHawk> gn8
[11:34] <con-man> anyone here heard of audio causing a system to hard lock?
[11:34] <Wiz> fangorious, seems like synaptics is running now..
[11:34] <tuskernini> psyber, can you see the card? lspci
[11:34] <Flannel> !persistence | meheren
[11:34] <ubotu> meheren: To have some persistent storage when using a Live CD, follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence
[11:34] <killermach> nothlit: I already accepted the defaults... it wasn't happy :)
[11:34] <con-man> !audio
[11:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about audio - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:34] <con-man> !sound
[11:34] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[11:34] <fangorious> Wiz: cool
[11:34] <meheren> Flannel, thanks
[11:34] <Romanov> hello
[11:34] <psyber> yes I see it
[11:34] <tuskernini> psyber, what card is it?
[11:34] <Wiz> thank's for your help guys..
[11:35] <Balachmar> Does anyone have experience with edgy crashing because of the cool and quiet technology?
[11:35] <psyber> broadcom 4306
[11:35] <nothlit> killermach, ahh, well if you look deep enough into the laptop specs, you can find it
[11:35] <SeamusLP> pvf I'm confused.  Are you trying to install from the dapper backports repository or the edgy eft repositories?
[11:35] <nothlit> killermach, you may have to follow through to the manufacturer info tho
[11:35] <tuskernini> psyber, damn!
[11:35] <cafuego> psyber: That is supported. All you need is firmware.
[11:35] <tuskernini> psyber, ok, dont worry...
[11:35] <clucas_> any help w/ radeon 9000... got black screen
[11:35] <nevron> i am starting to believe that using linux is a kind of masochist act
[11:35] <tuskernini> psyber, if a native driver does not work, ndiswrapper will
[11:35] <pvf> SeamusLP, er...
[11:36] <cafuego> psyber: http://us.ubuntu.cafuego.net/pool/dapper-cafuego/bcm43xx/bcm43xx-firmware_1.3-1ubuntu2_all.deb
[11:36] <psyber> I tryed using ndiswrapper
[11:36] <cafuego> tuskernini: The native drivers works fine.
[11:36] <pvf> SeamusLP, i added a line for the dapper backports and realized i already had one there
[11:36] <cafuego> psyber: Download and install the bcm43xx-firmware package; reboot, enjoy.
[11:36] <naylor> no it's not worked
[11:36] <tuskernini> cafuego, i had a broadcom 43xx and it gave me hell, had to work with ndiswrapper... am using atheros now
[11:36] <killermach> nothlit: would lshw probe the monitor for me??
[11:36] <pvf> SeamusLP, i'll add the line for the edgy backports then ... sorry for the confusion
[11:37] <superkirbyartist> Hello.
[11:37] <naylor> and i can't remove python-gtk2 because it wants to remove loads of stuff if i do that
[11:37] <cafuego> tuskernini: The 4318 set is a big unstable still, the 4310 and 4312 suck, but the 4306 works great.
[11:37] <superkirbyartist> I would like to change the splash screen.  It says "Kubuntu" but I want it to say "Xubuntu".
[11:37] <nevron> anyone using samsung syncmaster 750s?
[11:37] <naylor> and reinstallng the packages doesn't work
[11:37] <nothlit> killermach, no i'm sorry it wouldn't
[11:37] <Balachmar> nobody has any onfo on cool and quiet?
[11:37] <usr_rob> How do i change bash color ? I want all text green.
[11:37] <SeamusLP> pvf you may want to stick to dapper backports, but edgy backport packages may also work
[11:37] <Balachmar> because the random crashes are very annoying
[11:37] <naylor> can anyone suggest anthying, here's the error i get again: http://pastebin.ca/284160
[11:37] <cafuego> tuskernini: I use mine here with 802.x and radius auth through the nm-applet GUI, no issues.
[11:37] <tuskernini> cafuego, i must say, i did not install the firmware package you just mentioned, but i could modprobe the driver.
[11:38] <cafuego> tuskernini: Yes, the driver will load, but without firmware it can't use the hardware... so will fail. :-)
[11:38] <superkirbyartist> Please help.
[11:38] <fenerbahche> hi, my dev/hda7 is mounted to / . it is only 19 gb. i wanna make it bigger by buying new hd, can i do it without formatting my os ?
[11:38] <naylor> i've tried reinstalling all the packages it says had errors but that doesn't work either
[11:38] <clucas_> is there a way to cycle thru resolutions with a keystroke
[11:38] <superkirbyartist> Hello?
[11:38] <Red-Sox> How do I enable 3d acceleration on my ATI card?
[11:38] <rcrook> superkirbyartist: you can change the splash screen
[11:38] <tuskernini> cafuego, why could no one tell me that 4 months ago? well, that is how it goes... thanks anyhow
[11:38] <clucas_> icant see the screen ...black
[11:39] <superkirbyartist> rcrook: How?
[11:39] <cafuego> tuskernini: The wiki has some good docs on it...
[11:39] <rcrook> superkirbyartist: give me a sec to find the preferences
[11:39] <naylor> it's really messed the system up cos i can't run loads of things, like add/remove won't work, bittorrent won't work and others
[11:39] <fangorious> superkirbyartist: you need to change the symlink in (i think) /usr/share/splash and then run 'sudo update-initramfs -k $(uname -r)'
[11:39] <dougsko> fenerbahche: just copy / to the new drive, and in fstab, you can make it so it mounts the new drive as /
[11:39] <naylor> and reinstalling these won't work
=== panspermia is now known as cumcum82
[11:40] <dougsko> fenerbahche: you can have different partitions on differnt disks
[11:40] <LinAsH> fenerbahche, I'd say to mount the new hd as /home if it's for users data
[11:40] <fangorious> Balachmar: what's the 'cool and quiet' technology?
[11:40] <kitche> Balachmar: what is cool and quiet people probably don't know what that is
[11:40] <fenerbahche> LinAsh: i use vmware, and i need space, 19gb is not enouf...
[11:40] <Flannel> !repeat | Balachmar, (not the first clause, but the remainder)
[11:40] <superkirbyartist> It says "Can't find splash"
[11:40] <ubotu> Balachmar, (not the first clause, but the remainder): Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[11:40] <chrisnias> hi. things that live in /etc/init.d/* - are they called services? anyway, how do i tell them to start automatically, rather than having to call them explicitly using sudo?
[11:41] <sinisterguy> i'm having some trouble with totem-xine, i installed totem-xine and libxine-extracodecs and win32codecs, but when i play wmvs and movs and h.264 videos, i only get sound no video
[11:41] <rcrook> superkirbyartist: press alt-F2 run kcontroll then Appearances & Themes > Slpash Screen
[11:41] <kitche> chrisnias: sudo chmod +x the scripts that you want started at boot
[11:41] <Ubuntu_Iz> can anyone help me with running easyubuntu?
[11:41] <Balachmar> Cool and Quiet is a technologie to reduce the voltage on the cpu if it isn't being used much
[11:41] <clucas_> edgy installed but no video
[11:41] <fangorious> superkirbyartist: are you talking about the bootup splash screen? or the login splash screen?
[11:41] <chrisnias> they are all +x
[11:41] <Balachmar> and thus keep the cpu cool, it also reduces fan speed, thus quiet
[11:41] <macd> is it possible to use the dapper desktop live cd for a dapper server install?
[11:42] <chrisnias> but i have to call vpnclient start to get it running..
[11:42] <Balachmar> And I suspect it to cause random crashes...
[11:42] <superkirbyartist> Bootup.
[11:42] <kitche> Balachmar: ok so you mean cpu scaling which the kernel does on it's own they are probably conficting with each other probably
[11:42] <j^> dapper php5 from security does not install
[11:42] <samalex> hey guys..  i just downloaded ubuntu 6.10 for powerpc, but though it didn't say it on the file or website, the ISO was for the live version.  Do they have an installable version of 6.10 yet?
[11:42] <fangorious> Balachmar: i haven't had any trouble with cpu scaling
[11:42] <pvf> SeamusLP, i already added the edgy backports and it still says "already at newest version"
[11:42] <macd> samalex, you install from the livdCD
[11:42] <rcrook> superkirbyartist: ahhh... thats a different matter
[11:42] <fenerbahche> dougsko: how will i copy  / to new hd ? you mean what i all have will be copied to the new data ? because / is 19 gb
[11:42] <j^> it looks for version ubuntu3.3, but the server only has 3.4 anyone knows whats going on?
[11:42] <rcrook> superkirbyartist: that I will have to research..
[11:42] <cafuego> samalex: The liveCD has an installer icon on the desktop.
[11:43] <samalex> macd, really?  is this the same in 6.06?
[11:43] <naylor> how do i find out what the dependency problems are, tried reinstalling all the packages but it won't let me due to the dependency probs??
[11:43] <Balachmar> No, now I have turned it off, in the BIOS and CPU scaling is unsupported in ubuntu
[11:43] <fangorious> superkirbyartist: did you find the symlink in /usr/share/splash?
[11:43] <superkirbyartist> And to get rid of my old KDE stuff (except Kopete and Konversation"
[11:43] <dougsko> fenerbahche: i mean, copy the / partition from the old drive to the new one
[11:43] <macd> samalex, 6.06 is dapper.
[11:43] <SeamusLP> pvf maybe you should search the backport repository online and see if there is a newer version
[11:43] <Balachmar> But now it does seem to run without crashes.
[11:43] <superkirbyartist> fangorious: there is no /usr/share/splash
[11:43] <nevron> ok dbo i found the refresh rate but the two monitors have different rates if i set them according to the lower range can i get them working
[11:44] <DBO> nevron, should work ok
[11:44] <fenerbahche> dougsko: am i going to have grub error after it ?
[11:44] <naylor> hello anyone?
[11:44] <samalex> ahh, gotcha.  i'm installing on an imac g3, and it appeared it started to load, but video went blank.  I didn't know if it was lagging due to older hardware or what.
[11:44] <nevron> ok i am trying
[11:44] <fangorious> superkirbyartist: you could 'apt-get autoremove kubuntu-desktop
[11:44] <fangorious> and then just reinstall kopete and konversation
[11:44] <pavelkunc> good evening has anyone problems with dead keys in jEdit?
[11:44] <gulp> tu sais pas crire ?
[11:44] <dougsko> fenerbahche: i dont know...do you have a separate /boot partition?
[11:44] <Balachmar> And I have found a thread on ubuntuforums of someone experiencing a similar problem
[11:44] <cafuego> samalex: I expect so, the G3 iMacs aren't that spiffy anymore. I tend to run 5.04 or 5.10 on mine, that needs less ram.
[11:44] <fenerbahche> dougsko: no i dont
[11:45] <gulp> What ?
[11:45] <pvf> SeamusLP, what's the url ?
[11:45] <samalex> caf

[11:45] <gulp> Ok
[11:45] <samalex> cafuego: i had problems with 5.10 on the g3...
[11:45] <gulp> I suppose
[11:45] <cafuego> samalex: Hmm.
[11:45] <Ubuntu_Iz> anyone available for help?
[11:45] <superkirbyartist> cafuego: No, Xubuntu works very well, as fast as Ubuntu (with XGL/Beryl) loads on a 1.8 ghZ PC.  BTW, How do you know I'm using an iMac?
[11:46] <clucas_> is there a channel for help on PPC?
[11:46] <fangorious> superkirbyartist: have the symlink point to usplash-theme-ubuntu.so, then run 'sudo update-initramfs -k $(uname -r)'
[11:46] <gulp> In french if you can
[11:46] <dougsko> fenerbahche: then yeah, i dont think youll be able to boot off the new disk that way then
[11:46] <kitche> !fr|gulp
[11:46] <ubotu> gulp: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[11:46] <gulp> please...
[11:46] <superkirbyartist> No usplash, how do you make a symlink point?
[11:46] <cafuego> superkirbyartist: I've found even Xubuntu to be unusable slow on an iMac 233 with 64Mb ram (with 256Mb they're fine)
[11:46] <kitche> superkirbyartist: what version of ubuntu are you on?
[11:47] <fangorious> superkirbyartist: no /usr/lib/usplash?
[11:47] <superkirbyartist> You're out of luck, I have a DVD-ROM iMac DV.  kitche: Xubuntu
[11:47] <superkirbyartist> With a bunch of KDE stuff.
[11:47] <pavelkunc> good evening has anyone problems with dead keys in jEdit? Actually in any Java Swing app I can't write numbers 2,3,4,5?
[11:47] <un_operateur1> 64MB RAM isn't going to suffice for any GUI of today's standards
[11:47] <cafuego> superkirbyartist: That said, these days I netboot the iMacs from a multicore LTSP server with lost of ram - speeds things up no end :-)
[11:47] <gulp> Can you kick me please. I need your help.
[11:48] <superkirbyartist> Where is the so file?
[11:48] <kitche> superkirbyartist: 6.06(dapper) or 6.10(edgy)
[11:48] <rcrook> superkirbyartist: if I remember correctly its not an easy task. you need to change the bitmap in the initrd image for the kernel
[11:48] <superkirbyartist> Directly on PC.  6.10
[11:48] <un_operateur1> gulp, do you need help in french?
[11:48] <psyber> hey cafuego
[11:48] <kitche> !usplash|superkirbyartist this should help you
[11:48] <ubotu> superkirbyartist this should help you: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[11:48] <cafuego> psyber: yo

[11:49] <psyber> any thoughts?
[11:49] <superkirbyartist> Not a Bondi Blue iMac, it is kinda white/ very light gray/
[11:49] <cafuego> psyber: Open a terminal and type 'iwconfig'
[11:49] <samalex> cafuego: you running 5.10 on your g3 now?  I had an issue where if the clock wasn't updated it hosed.  This mac I think has a dead clock battery.
[11:49] <fangorious> psyber: arm rests shouldn't be slippery
[11:49] <samalex> it's a 400mhz with 256 megs/ram.
[11:50] <cafuego> samalex: Same here, I set it by hand to at least 2006 during bootup, then as soon as the network is up, I run ntpdate on it.
[11:50] <psyber> it just says no wireless extensions
[11:50] <gulp> hello world !
[11:50] <cafuego> psyber: on all cards?
[11:50] <psyber> yup
[11:51] <psyber> lo eth0 and slit0
[11:51] <psyber> sorry sit0
[11:51] <cafuego> psyber: Is bcm43xx supposed to be eth1?
[11:51] <psyber> ?
[11:51] <psyber> I think so
[11:51] <psyber> its the wireless
[11:51] <zhimsel> hello, can anyone help me with some apt/deb related problems
[11:51] <zhimsel> ?
[11:51] <cafuego> is its module loaded at all?
[11:51] <psyber> ?
[11:52] <psyber> not sure...
[11:52] <superkirbyartist> Color calibration for monitor?
[11:52] <cafuego> lsmod | grep bcm
[11:52] <zhimsel> i would like to know if there is a way to "migrate" installed packages from another ubuntu installation
[11:52] <Ubuntu_Iz> :/
[11:52] <psyber> nothing came up
[11:52] <un_operateur1> !upgrade | zhimsel
[11:52] <ubotu> zhimsel: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:52] <cafuego> psyber: Then the driver didn't load. 'sudo modprobe bcm43xx'
[11:52] <naylor> please can anyone help me with these errors:  http://pastebin.ca/284160
[11:52] <superkirbyartist> Can someone please help me calibrate monitor colors?
[11:52] <LjL> !cloning | zhimsel
[11:52] <ubotu> zhimsel: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type "dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages", move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type "sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade"
[11:53] <zhimsel> Thanks!
[11:53] <psyber> ok reboot again?
[11:53] <cafuego> psyber: No, rerun 'iwconfig'
[11:53] <psyber> eth1 is there
[11:53] <cafuego> yay
[11:54] <psyber> but no wireless
[11:54] <zhimsel> Would that work in a chrooted environment (i.e. I don't have access to the other installation, but I have access to the filesystem)?
[11:54] <cafuego> hrm
[11:54] <cafuego> what does `dmesg' say about it?
[11:54] <superkirbyartist> My colors are messed up on my monitor!
[11:54] <psyber> alot
[11:54] <superkirbyartist> Please help me.
[11:54] <psyber> crap g/g
[11:54] <psyber> grrr
[11:54] <un_operateur1> Is there a way to tell aptitude not to remove a particular set of packages -- I need libxpm-dev and x-dev to stay put as i need those packages when building others from source?

[11:55] <mzanfardino> I have installed a KDE application but am using the GNOME desktop.  I want to add a link to my menu and have found ".desktop" files located in /usr/share/applications.  Is there any documentation explaining how to properly configure these files to build menus?
[11:55] <samalex> well the live CD for 6.10 won't even boot on my g3 :-(
[11:55] <cafuego> KingAztech: Stop spamming.
[11:55] <un_operateur1> cafuego, how do you do that?
[11:55] <mzanfardino> !.desktop
[11:55] <ubotu> The available desktop environments in Ubuntu are Gnome (ubuntu-desktop), KDE (kubuntu-desktop), XCFE (xubuntu-desktop), IceWM, Fluxbox, WindowMaker (wmaker), FVWM  and others.
[11:55] <Shaba1> Ok what is t difference between "Edgy and Dapper"
[11:55] <cafuego> un_operateur1: echo hold <packagename> | sudo dpkg --set-selections
[11:55] <mzanfardino> 6.06 ans 6.10
[11:55] <un_operateur1> cafuego, nice -- thanks :)

[11:56] <Shaba1> thank mzanfardino
[11:56] <mzanfardino> different kernels
[11:56] <superkirbyartist> !edgy vs. dapper
[11:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about edgy vs. dapper - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:56] <fenerbahche> my / is 19 gb, if i mount a partition that is 20 gb to /home . will my / be 39 gb ?
[11:56] <cafuego> un_operateur1: Note that it will hold it on the current version, so it won't auto-upgrde when a new one is released.

[11:56] <crimsun_> ubotu: .desktop =~ s/XCFE/Xfce/
[11:56] <cafuego> fenerbahche: no
[11:56] <Shaba1> how do you check which on you installed?
[11:56] <LjL> !botabuse
[11:56] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops...
[11:56] <cafuego> fenerbahche: Your / will be 19G and /home will be 20.
[11:56] <mzanfardino> Shaba1: uname -r
[11:56] <mzanfardino> Shaba1: will give you the kernel
[11:57] <un_operateur1> cafuego, is there no way to get around that?
[11:57] <crimsun_> LjL: is that bothersome?
[11:57] <fenerbahche> cafuego: i need place for vmware, what to do ??
[11:57] <cafuego> un_operateur1: There probably is, but I don't know what that way would be.
[11:57] <Shaba1> thanks mzanfardino did you see my previous statement?
[11:57] <cafuego> fenerbahche: Plonk it in /opt/vmware or somesuch
[11:57] <LjL> crimsun_: huh no, no... i was referring to !edgy vs dapper. i've just changed .desktop
[11:57] <cafuego> 19Gb is a bit large for /
[11:58] <mzanfardino> Shaba1: you could look at your /etc/apt/sources.list and see whether it's configured to pull from dapper or edgy
[11:58] <un_operateur1> cafuego, ok, would aptitude atleast warn me that new releases are available??
[11:58] <Shaba1> JUST to let all fo you know that I am going to be back here like day and night for the next two weeks getting this network set up
[11:58] <cafuego> un_operateur1: yes
[11:58] <Music_Shuffle> Haha
[11:58] <un_operateur1> cafuego, thats cool then -- I can always manually update them
[11:58] <cafuego> un_operateur1: it will, it'll tell you your packages were not upgraded ebcause they're on hold.
[11:58] <Music_Shuffle> I'm so sorry Shaba1. ;P
[11:58] <Shaba1> So if I tend to ask stupid newbie questions that is why
[11:58] <fenerbahche> cafuego: how to plonk? you mean mount ?
[11:59] <mzanfardino> Shaba1: I've been using linux now for the last month (am a windows nerd too) and I love it.  It's not tough... just stick it out and read everything you can
[11:59] <cafuego> fenerbahche: Just install vmware and put your virtual machiens in /opt/vmware
[11:59] <mzanfardino> !.desktop files
[11:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about desktop files - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:59] <cafuego> fenerbahche: Create an /opt/vmware dir and make sur you have write access to it.
[11:59] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah. Google is your new best BESTEST friend.
[11:59] <mzanfardino> !menu
[11:59] <ubotu> menu: generates programs menu for all menu-aware applications. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.1.29 (edgy), package size 379 kB, installed size 1580 kB
[11:59] <Shaba1> Well I have to. My non profit is too poor to buy windows XP PRO
[11:59] <fenerbahche> cafuego: the problem, vmware already installed and it has fedora and suse and pardus
[12:00] <Shaba1> and I have to get these 15 donated machines up and running by the 3rd
[12:00] <zhimsel> ubotu: can I p/m you?
[12:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about can I p/m you? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:00] <mzanfardino> Shaba1: You will be better off without windows.  and if you have a need for a windows specific app, just install vmware (which is free)
[12:00] <zhimsel> ah... its a bot... duh :)
[12:00] <fenerbahche> zhimsel: it is bot , ubotu
[12:00] <fenerbahche> :)
[12:00] <zhimsel> i figured
[12:00] <zhimsel> YOU DIDNT SEE ANYTHING!!! :)
[12:01] <Denyerec> updating to dappaer just fucked my server
[12:01] <mzanfardino> Shaba1: what are you using the maching for?
[12:01] <cafuego> fenerbahche: well, you can always simply move the VMs to another partition.
[12:01] <Denyerec> Won't even boot now.
