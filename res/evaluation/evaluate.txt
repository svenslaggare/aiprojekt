<xtknight> well actually it can, but only once they reach 85..that's a CPU feature not a linux one.  there is no userspace gov for C2D yet
[12:04] <xtknight> unsupported?
[12:04] <xtknight> not that i know of yet, it can't.

[12:04] <Alan> Stormx2, depends on the mood i'm in - gmpc, ncmpc, pympd.... all create the same problem, as does plain 'mpc toggle'

[12:05] <centinul> javajake: my system doesn't boot up into rcS do that wouldn't help
[12:05] <user_> hey guys, i have one question. Do you reads techblog?
[12:05] <Stormx2> Alan: I was about to suggest checking with mpc heh. My only recommendation is uninstall, build-dep and compile from source.
[12:05] <Slart> AndyC1: nah.. you might get more from making hard drives go to sleep.. disabling other stuff etc
[12:05] <centinul> how do I get my system to boot into that runlevel?
=== nekton[A]  is now known as nekton
[12:05] <javaJake> centinul, oh, no kidding! What does it use to boot?
=== Tim [n=twright@leibniz.catalyst.net.nz]  has joined #ubuntu
[12:05] <centinul> javajake: it boots to runlevel 2
[12:06] <Stormx2> Alan: it isn't that much of a big deal doing that.
[12:06] <centinul> can I change that?
[12:06] <kahrytan> Stormx: The mic does work but....
[12:06] <javaJake> centinul, OK, then use folder /etc/rc2.d/ instead...

[12:06] <centinul> ya I realize that, but can I change the runlevel that it boots to?
[12:06] <Alan> Stormx2, i can do it in a way that can easily be uninstalled with apt-get/aptitude ?
[12:06] <GaiaX11_> Why did they kick mozilla and opera away from the repos?
