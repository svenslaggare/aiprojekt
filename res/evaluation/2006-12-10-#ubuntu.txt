[12:01] <beerockxs> does anyone know how to make suspend to ram work with an ati X1900GT?
[12:01] <python> sorry adaptr , and yes Pelo.
[12:01] <Pelo> python,  in anycase, good for ludde, he deserves to make some cash from it
[12:01] <Jowi> alex_, "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices" or check in the "hal-device-manager"
[12:01] <M3L7down> adaptr: well, I wouldn't be asking if I knew that now would I? :D
[12:01] <Arwen> beerockxs, there's a post on the Ubuntu forums... one sec
[12:01] <python> Pelo , he sold out at 20 millions
[12:01] <adaptr> beerockxs: nobody knows how to make anything work with an ATI ;-)
[12:01] <python> what can you expect when the mpaa throws that money in ur face
[12:01] <Pelo> python,  actualy money or options ?
[12:01] <M3L7down> adaptr: k, all the stuff is filled in.
[12:02] <alex_> the hal-device-manager ?
[12:02] <slinky_> kitche: got it thank you
[12:02] <M3L7down> adaptr: save?
[12:02] <d1gital> python:  huh?
[12:02] <alex_> Jowi: the hal device manager ?
[12:02] <adaptr> M3L7down: okay, now go and find the Screen section
[12:02] <beerockxs> adaptr: heh. I hope the rumors that they are considering open-sourcing their drivers after the merger with AMD are true.
[12:02] <Cpudan80> How do you change the gdm setups in gnome?
[12:02] <Cpudan80> the gdm themes*
[12:02] <Jowi> alex_, mount only show mounted devices. type "hal-device-manager" in a terminal
[12:02] <M3L7down> adaptr: found it
[12:02] <Can0beans> sup?
[12:02] <nothlit_> Cpudan80, system administration login setup
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[12:02] <python> ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso	1	698 MB	46.2 %	Downloading	140 (699)	8 (102)	827.1 kB/s	14.8 kB/s	7m 48s	3
[12:02] <adaptr> M3L7down: what resolutions do you have ? I'd advise you to just delete all the sections less than 24 bit, I find them annoying
[12:03] <Cpudan80> nothlit: huh?
[12:03] <Cpudan80> oh ok
[12:03] <Cpudan80> I see
[12:03] <nothlit> Cpudan80, the gnome menu
[12:03] <adaptr> M3L7down: before deleting recklessly, take a good look at how it is structured - it;s not really that hard, but *be sure* :)
[12:03] <nothlit> Cpudan80, you can drag and drop themes
[12:03] <slinky_> goodbye folks and thank
[12:03] <Arwen> beerockxs, try disabling stuff in your /etc/acpi-whatever
[12:03] <adaptr> M3L7down: it will start with a 1 bit section, which is monochrome X.. brrrr
[12:03] <M3L7down> adaptr: I do indeed have all those bit sections
[12:03] <Arwen> beerockxs, I think you have to have suspend restart X server after resume
[12:03] <M3L7down> subsections that is
[12:03] <d1gital> python: .......whoa.
[12:03] <Cpudan80> nothlit: The GDM theme I donwloaded said run gdmsetup... but that didn't do anything?
[12:03] <M3L7down> I have 1, 4, 8, 16, 24
[12:03] <adaptr> M3L7down: I usually delete the 1, 4, 8, 15, 16 bit sections, and just leave the 24 bit one
[12:04] <M3L7down> kk
[12:04] <M3L7down> I will do that
[12:04] <python> d1gital , its not that fast
[12:04] <beerockxs> Arwen: hmm, that kind of defeats the purpose of suspending in the first place.
[12:04] <adaptr> M3L7down: take good care not to screw up the begin/endsectiosn, and remove everything but the 24 bit section
[12:04] <python> my server can download at 11.5 MB/s
[12:04] <M3L7down> and I have the values 1152x864, 1024x768,800x600,640x480
[12:04] <Jowi> alex_, there is also another program called "usbview" that you can use. it is not installed by default
[12:04] <Jowi> !info usbview
[12:04] <python> which is 11500 kB/s
[12:04] <Arwen> beerockxs, I know
[12:04] <ubotu> usbview: USB device viewer. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0-7 (edgy), package size 197 kB, installed size 636 kB
[12:04] <M3L7down> but it doesn't recognize the 1152x864 one
[12:04] <adaptr> M3L7down: is 1152 the highest res your crad/monitor will handle ?
[12:04] <leny> blue-frog: Replace it with one of the files you see when you do an 'ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us*'
[12:04] <Arwen> beerockxs, the newer fglrx has improved support for acpi, but don't count on much improvement
[12:05] <effie_jayx> !info feisty
[12:05] <ubotu> Package feisty does not exist in any distro I know
[12:05] <effie_jayx> ;)
[12:05] <Arwen> !feisty
[12:05] <ubotu> The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is pre-alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule - Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty - Help in #ubuntu+1
[12:05] <alex_> I found my device in /proc/bus/usb/devices but it does not say what /dev/ it has been given
[12:05] <alex_> Jowi: ^^
[12:05] <effie_jayx> has anyone installed herd 1?
[12:05] <effie_jayx> apart from dev of course :D
[12:05] <blue-frog> leny: ty, have also done a reconfigure console data
[12:05] <beerockxs> Arwen: newer fglrx? One which is not yet in the repositories?
[12:05] <d1gital> python:    it is in my little world....
[12:05] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy amd64?
[12:05] <adaptr> alex_: that's ebcause, strictkly speaking, HAL /D-Bus does not use /dev anymore
[12:05] <Arwen> alex_, the device manager should have more info on it - it's hard to figure these things out
[12:06] <M3L7down> adaptr: no, it can go to 1280x1024, but I don't want that resolution
[12:06] <python> d1gital , what home connection do you have
[12:06] <Arwen> beerockxs, yea
[12:06] <python> and where do you live?
[12:06] <python> why dont you ask ur isp for an upgrage
[12:06] <adaptr> M3L7down: whichever one you want, and are *sure* it supports (both card and monitor), fill that in as first option
[12:06] <Arwen> beerockxs, the repos fglrx is always old for stability reasons
[12:06] <M3L7down> adaptr: done
[12:06] <beerockxs> Arwen: ah. will the new ones be in the repos for Feisty, or earlier?
[12:06] <M3L7down> its in descending order
[12:06] <adaptr> M3L7down: can you paste me the resolutions line just to be sure ?
[12:06] <Arwen> beerockxs, ATi's page has an installer - whether it works or not depends
[12:07] <M3L7down> adaptr: 	Modes		"1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
[12:07] <alex_> Arwen: Hal Device manager ?
[12:07] <jman_> Can someone please reccomend a good dial up modem that ubuntu supports?
[12:07] <M3L7down> but I added the 1152x864 part myself
[12:07] <d1gital> python:  i have verizon dsl, uniontown, pa (near pittsburgh)    hopefully fios will come soon.
[12:07] <xerophyte> does anybody know where can i get svn 1.4.x package
[12:07] <Arwen> alex_, no idea - its the one under System > Device Manager
[12:07] <python> ahh
[12:07] <M3L7down> as per the orders of someone on the forums
[12:07] <adaptr> M3L7down: you can safely remove the last two I think.. ubuntu would be unbearable at those ;-)
[12:07] <python> bummer dude
[12:07] <Arwen> jman_, there's no good winmodem - try buying an external serial one
[12:07] <python> well
[12:07] <M3L7down> adaptr: actually its unrunnable, you can't even install the live cd at those low resolutions
[12:07] <Arwen> you can internal hardware modems, but they're expensive as hell
[12:07] <d1gital> yeah..  hey atleast its not dualup, right?
[12:07] <python> d1gital , ubunutu is downloaded in 16 mins on uTorrent
[12:07] <python> time to burn
[12:08] <jman_> Arwen: I am not looking for a winmodem I mean any modem, can someone make a reccomendation
[12:08] <adaptr> M3L7down: now also make sure that your Monitor section does *not* have the DDC option set.. that is what causes it to query the monitor itself for the data you have just entered, and apparently it was wrong....
[12:08] <Arwen> jman_, any hardware modem will work
[12:08] <M3L7down> adaptr: where is the ddc option
[12:08] <Jowi> alex_, oops. try "dmesg"
[12:08] <Arwen> jman_, just search on eBay for a hardware modem - you can tell from the screenshot
[12:08] <Dev05> Hi! I just installed and de-installed the Network Manager. Now, everything takes forever to start, even a logon. Any ideas on what's going on?
[12:09] <adaptr> M3L7down: have you run with that 1152 resolution before ? if you cannot verify that it works, at least leave the 1024x768 in that line as well, so you can switch to it if your monitor dies on you...
[12:09] <LaserLine> Gnome seems to keep crashing for me and I don't know why.  Is there an error log somewhere I can look to see what's going on?
[12:09] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy amd64?
[12:09] <adaptr> M3L7down: it may or may not be in the Monitor section - if it's not, all is good
[12:09] <kimitaka> I've installed SWAT package but still not found when I try to browse to it at http://localhost:901/
[12:09] <M3L7down> adaptr: yes, I run windows at that resolution
[12:09] <M3L7down> all the time
[12:09] <Jowi> alex_, in "dmesg" you should find a line that says "sdb: sdb1" or similar depending on your hardware
[12:09] <adaptr> M3L7down: then you should be good to go.. save the conf file
[12:09] <M3L7down> done
[12:10] <d1gital> python:  yeah this whole area is kinda behind on the tech stuff...
[12:10] <d1gital> (06:04:28 PM) ffxnos: (06:02:46 PM) python: ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso	1	698 MB	46.2 %	Downloading	140 (699)	8 (102)	827.1 kB/s	14.8 kB/s	7m 48s	3

[12:10] <d1gital> (06:05:10 PM) ffxnos: that's insane.  that guy gets 827kbps downspeeds
[12:10] <d1gital> (06:05:16 PM) ffxnos: i wish i had that...
[12:10] <d1gital> (06:05:32 PM) mysticrule: holy shit
[12:10] <jman_> So Arwen if you go to best buy and get a lets say Creative labs 56k k external modem will I have any problems configuring  beucase A) I don;t want to waste my time or money B) I have to go dial up for a while
[12:10] <adaptr> M3L7down: now restart X.. close all windows you don't want to kill without warning (such as this one) and press control-alt-backspace
[12:10] <alex_> Jowi:  /dev/scsi/host8/bus0/target0/lun0: p1 p2
[12:10] <alex_> [4307586.797000]  Attached scsi removable disk sdb at scsi8, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
[12:10] <alex_> Jowi is that it ?
[12:10] <kitche> kimitaka: check the inetd.conf it should be in /etc you might have to uncomment a line
[12:10] <adaptr> M3L7down: because killing X *will* log you out!
[12:10] <effie_jayx> !hal
[12:10] <ubotu> hal: Hardware Abstraction Layer. In component main, is optional. Version 0.5.7.1-0ubuntu17 (edgy), package size 347 kB, installed size 1112 kB
[12:10] <python> d1gital
[12:10] <Arwen> jman_, nope
[12:10] <python> I'll upload a screenshot
[12:10] <python> hold on
[12:10] <jman_> ok
[12:11] <Arwen> jman_, just wvdialconf wvdial.conf and you're configured
[12:11] <alex_> Jowi, so to manually mount it , is it mount -t ext2 /dev/scsi8 /media ?
[12:11] <LaserLine> Anyone know where the gnome error log is?  Gnome keeps freezing on me.
[12:11] <Jowi> alex_, only you can know. see if the Vendor correspond to your device: Vendor: Samsung   Model: YP-MT6
[12:11] <adaptr> alex_: ext2 will be autodetected, no need to specify the type
[12:11] <alex_> Jowi: yes it is it
[12:11] <alex_> :)
[12:11] <kimitaka> kitche, thanks
[12:12] <adaptr> alex_: you have a Samsung Yepp as well ? I like it ;-)
[12:12] <kitche> kimitaka: look for swat line see if it has # infront of it and remove the #
[12:12] <M3L7down> adaptr: YOU ARE MY HERO
[12:12] <Arwen> alex_, you have a SCSI hard drive?
[12:12] <adaptr> M3L7down: I take it you are logged back in at glorious 1152xwhatever :)
[12:12] <lifepositive>  how can I tell firefox to use mplayer instead of totem?
[12:12] <alex_> Arwen, Jowi, I got this mount: special device /dev/scsi8 does not exist
[12:12] <M3L7down> adaptr: thats right!
[12:12] <Dev05> lifepositive, Install the respective plugins.
[12:13] <kimitaka> kitche, actually they aren't there
[12:13] <Jowi> alex_, you need to use the full path /dev/scsi/host8/bus0/target0/lun0
[12:13] <adaptr> M3L7down: consider yourself fully Linuxized...
[12:13] <lifepositive> Dev05: what respective plugins?
[12:13] <M3L7down> adaptr: the funny thing is, I was on my way to the  correct solution
[12:13] <Arwen> alex_, err, is your hdd scsi?
[12:13] <adaptr> M3L7down: what kind of video card do you have ?
[12:13] <M3L7down> adaptr: I was messing with those values before
[12:13] <Dev05> lifepositive, To use Totem, install the mozilla Totem plugin. If you want MPlayer, deinstall Mozilla Totem and install Mozilla MPlayer.
[12:13] <alex_> Jowi: ok
[12:13] <M3L7down> Radeon 9200
[12:13] <Jowi> alex_, i don't know what the "p1 p2" stands for since I have no hardware that is detected like that
[12:13] <python> d1gital
[12:13] <python> hold on one second mate
[12:13] <adaptr> M3L7down: yes, but X can be very unforgiving.. get one setting wrong and it doesn't start...
[12:14] <Dev05> lifepositive, Let me search for the packages names.
[12:14] <lifepositive> Dev05: how do I deinstall Mozilla Totem?
[12:14] <adaptr> M3L7down: do you have DIrect Rendering enabled on the fglrx driver ?
[12:14] <python> http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/7649/speedha7.jpg
[12:14] <python> there you go d1gital
[12:14] <python> http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/7649/speedha7.jpg
[12:14] <lifepositive> Dev05: thank you :)
[12:14] <adaptr> M3L7down: it wil make all the difference in screen speed
[12:14] <Budgieman> hello, i've used ubuntu for a while but only recently have i upgraded to the latest version, and i'm having trouble configuring my video card; with the old versions, there was a program to configure your video card under System/Preferences or Administation, but i can't find it now
[12:14] <adaptr> M3L7down: providing you have some CPU speed as well, of course
[12:14] <Jowi> alex_, how you will have to mount this device I can not help with I'm afraid. but at least you know which /dev it is attached to.
[12:14] <M3L7down> adaptr: I have no problems with screen speed, my CPU and card are set correctly
[12:14] <Dev05> lifepositive, To deinstall Totem Mozilla: sudo aptitude remove totem-mozilla
[12:14] <kambiz> hi everyone, can anyone help me either speed up VNC access to my ubuntu box or install FreeNX or NomachineNX
[12:14] <Dev05> lifepositive, To install it, just change remove to install.
[12:15] <kimitaka> kitche, got it, I needed inetd, never heard of not having inetd :-S
[12:15] <keeganX> lifepositive: sudo apt-get install mplayer-mozilla
[12:15] <lifepositive> Dev05: ty
[12:15] <lifepositive> keeganX: cheers
[12:15] <Enzoblue> Hiyas. I need help with Wifi
[12:15] <Pelo> python,   xp %???  say it aint so
[12:15] <keeganX> I mean mozilla-mplayer
[12:15] <alex_> Jowi: mount: special device /dev/scsi/host8/bus0/target0/lun0 does not exist
[12:15] <lyy> what's the package name for apache?
[12:15] <python> yeah Pelo , hence I dl'ed ubuntu as a dual boot
[12:15] <Jowi> alex_, do you have a p1 in dev? "ls -la /dev/p1"
[12:15] <python> Lynoure
[12:15] <python> lyy
[12:15] <python> apt-get install apache ?
[12:15] <lifepositive> Dev05: Couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "totem-mozilla"
[12:15] <Enzoblue> wifi help needed with an hp pavillion dv1000...
[12:15] <alex_> Jowi: nope
[12:15] <lyy> thx
[12:16] <Pelo> lifepositive,  just look for totem
[12:16] <Jowi> alex_, ah. i have no idea i'm afraid.
[12:16] <kambiz> hi everyone, can anyone help me either speed up VNC access to my ubuntu box or install FreeNX or NomachineNX
[12:16] <adaptr> M3L7down: excellent
[12:16] <lifepositive> Pelo: look for Totem where?
[12:16] <Dev05> lifepositive, To have those, you have to enable some repos I think.
[12:16] <lifepositive> Pelo: I want to remove totem from firefox
[12:16] <keeganX> lifepositive: type sudo aptitude search totem
[12:16] <keeganX> Then look for the mozilla plugin
[12:16] <Pelo> lifepositive,   search synaptic for totem packages, remove the correct one
[12:16] <alex_> Jowi: nor do I have a /dev/scsi anyway and that is to answer Arwen question I guess :S
[12:16] <lifepositive> Dev05: they are all enabled!  but it says totem isnt even installed, but it id
[12:16] <adaptr> lifepositive: it is installed by default, applications->sound and video
[12:17] <adaptr> lifepositive: it's called Movie Player in the menu
[12:17] <M3L7down> adaptr: gotta go
[12:17] <adaptr> M3L7down: bye
[12:17] <M3L7down> adaptr: thanks much
[12:17] <leny> LaserLine: Are you sure its Gnome. That is does Ctrl-Alt-Backspace get you back to the login screen
[12:17] <adaptr> np
[12:17] <alex_> Arwen: any idea ?
[12:17] <lifepositive> i cant remove totem-mozilla  ! any ideas?
[12:17] <kambiz> or how about this, does anyone have any tips on using ubuntu remotely?
[12:18] <python> kambiz
[12:18] <adaptr> kambiz: from what do you need to access it ?
[12:18] <python> you need to install vncserver
[12:18] <NineTeen67Comet> HI all .. any one know how I can use vnc to access screen :0 ? It keeps saying there is a lock .. but even in the remote desktop it says to use :0 .. (I need it so I can make this person's tutorial with their desktop) ..
[12:18] <kambiz> okay i have install vncserver. i would like to access it from within my internal network
[12:18] <kambiz> vnc is unbearably slow
[12:18] <python> NineTeen67Comet , why dont you start a screen on :1 ?
[12:18] <kambiz> its not even usuable on 100MBits
[12:18] <Dev05> lifepositive, So then is not installed...
[12:19] <python> kambiz , apt-get install vnc on the other machine
[12:19] <Dev05> lifepositive, Unless you compiled it from source.
[12:19] <lifepositive> Dev05: why then does it load Totem whenever I use firefox?
[12:19] <Jowi> NineTeen67Comet, I think you need to use x11vnc to export :0
[12:19] <python> then vnc ip:screen
[12:19] <Jowi> !vnc
[12:19] <ubotu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[12:19] <kambiz> i read alternatives are FreeNX or NoMachineNX servers
[12:19] <adaptr> kambiz: then you need to look for something else
[12:19] <Arwen> alex_, I have no idea what your original problem was, lol
[12:19] <Dev05> lifepositive, Are you sure is Totem?
[12:19] <Jowi> !info x11vnc
[12:19] <ubotu> x11vnc: VNC server which uses your current X11 session. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.8.2-1 (edgy), package size 438 kB, installed size 1104 kB
[12:19] <Jowi> ah, there you go
[12:19] <lifepositive> Dev05: it says loading Totem and its totem
[12:19] <adaptr> kambiz: what is the OS you want to access it from ?
[12:20] <kambiz> Mac OS X
[12:20] <keeganX> Right when you install mplayer for mozilla it should automatically take over totems position
[12:20] <Pelo> lifepositive,   I told you,  use synaptic ,and search for totem packages
[12:20] <Pelo> the right one wil be in the list
[12:20] <kambiz> adaptr, Mac OS X, I am using Chicken of the VNC as the client access my Ubuntu VNC server
[12:20] <newbie0057> hello I'm looking for some quick hardware advice, I'm installing ubuntu on a 64 bit amd, I have a 300 gig hard drive, 1 gig of ram, I'd like to stet up myth tv, what partition sizes would you suggest?

[12:21] <newbie0057> Arwen shouldn't the swap be 2x the size of the memory?

[12:21] <ubotu> FreeNX is advanced remote desktop technology. For more information and install instructions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX

[12:22] <Arwen> newbie0057, your swap should depend on your needs
[12:22] <Arwen> alex_, do you have multiple SATA hard disks?
[12:22] <SilentDis> hello :)
[12:22] <Enzoblue> I really need help with getting my Wifi working on an HP Pavillion dv1000 laptop...
[12:22] <Arwen> newbie0057, I actually run without swap on 512 MB because I don't need it
[12:23] <Arwen> Pelo, did you hit the eject button?
[12:23] <alex_> Arwen: I have a laptop so only one HD
[12:23] <lifepositive> Pelo: :)
[12:23] <keeganX> Poltergeist
[12:23] <lifepositive> Pelo: i did it ;)
[12:23] <Arwen> alex_, is it SATA?
[12:23] <Jowi> newbie0057, not sure if you want this advice or not: freevo is much easier to set up and works great :)
[12:23] <Pelo> Arwen,   I mean no reason
[12:23] <kambiz> oh btw, there aren't any packages for FreeNX server for edgy 6.10. it seems like FreeNX is dead now and NomachineNX has picked up in its wake
[12:23] <alex_> Arwen: not sure
[12:23] <newbie0057> Awen, I thought that the computer always uses it, could it be that I set up a swap and I am not using it?
[12:23] <Arwen> alex_, but yea, try mounting sdb1 to media
[12:23] <addicted68098> This is very off topic but how do I enter my password for freenode, I completly forgot
[12:23] <SilentDis> I had a package give problems during it's install.  it seemed to work, but now apt reports the package needs to be reinstalled, but can't find it.  is there any way to simply 'clear' that requirement?
[12:23] <Pelo> again
[12:23] <Pelo> ...
[12:23] <lifepositive> Pelo: surely u have heard of trojans who others can control your system and open your dvd drive etc? :P
[12:23] <compengi> how to install a .bin file?
[12:23] <Arwen> gnome-mount keeps confusing my usb drive for a cdrom - what's up?
[12:23] <addicted68098> never mind
[12:23] <lifepositive> Pelo: run rootkithunter
[12:23] <adaptr> newbie0057: Ubuntu set up swap when you installed it, as for not using it.. run "free -m" in a console and see for yourself
[12:24] <Arwen> compengi, where'd you get it? .bin doesn't really mean anything
[12:24] <Enzoblue> other people say Wifi works "out of the box" on their hp laptop.. how come mine doesn't?
[12:24] <lifepositive> Pelo: you dont obnvsiousaly have secure system
[12:24] <johnd_> compengi: just chmod a+x, and ./BIN
[12:24] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy amd64?
[12:24] <johnd_> oops chmod a+x bin file
[12:24] <Arwen> adaptr, mem 502, 263 free... Swap 431, 431 free
[12:24] <newbie0057> how do I set up home ? is it the same as setting up / ?
[12:24] <Jowi> Enzoblue, have you installed gnome-network-manager?
[12:24] <LaserLine> leny: Gnome just freezed on me again, so I tried Ctrl+alt+Backspace and it did nothing
[12:25] <keeganX> If someone did hack your system, I'm sure they would do more than just open your cdrom drive
[12:25] <adaptr> Arwen: I thought I asked newbie0057.. oh well
[12:25] <lifepositive> Pelo: when was the last time you ran rookithunter?
[12:25] <SilentDis> I had a package give problems during it's install.  it seemed to work, but now apt reports the package needs to be reinstalled, but can't find it.  is there any way to simply 'clear' that requirement?
[12:25] <Arwen> johnd, careful, it could be weird or for another os
[12:25] <alex_> Arwen: looks like it works

[12:28] <Jowi> Enzoblue, FYI you need to log out and log in again after you installed network-manager gnome. you should get an icon on the taskbar indicating the wireless network
[12:28] <lifepositive> Pelo: ok
[12:28] <Arwen> compengi, must be an install script - do as the other guy said and chmod +x it
[12:28] <Arwen> compengi, then run it as a command

[12:29] <mcscruff> lo all, im trying to mount a samba share but i keep getting this error 12037: session setup failed: ERRDOS - ERRnoaccess (Access denied.)
[12:29] <adaptr> compengi: if you want to know what's in it, run "head binfile"
[12:29] <Jowi> Enzoblue, then it should be as simple as to click on the icon and set up the connection. *if* your hardware is ok
[12:29] <Pelo> lifepositive,  mirror is down, it won't update
[12:30] <Pelo> lifepositive,  it is more then likely it is just a fluke,  I have two dvd-rw and one is being used atm so it's not unlikely that the other one is just getting triggered,

[12:36] <jamesbrose> nope
[12:36] <jamesbrose> it was running kinda slow before

[12:36] <jamesbrose> but not too slow
[12:36] <Arwen> jamesbrose, ok, do you know the fs type of your hdd?
[12:36] <Jowi> Enzoblue, that guide that ubotu gave you should help you

[12:38] <Enzoblue> 120 IQ doesn't seem enough....
[12:38] <tjb891> any .exe file

[12:48] <Jowi> Enzoblue, cool. :)
[12:48] <Dev05> NineTeen67Comet, I know.
[12:48] <snype> try using aptitude to install then u can use aptitude and remove it to where u just were.
[12:48] <slop> crimsun, because i'm having some problems with my card outputing sound from flash movies
[12:48] <Jowi> Enzoblue, now it should be a snap to connect with the network-manager-gnome icon
[12:48] <Dimensions> Any One ??
[12:48] <slop> crimsun, i get a TON of errors in console when i run firefox and watch a flash movie
[12:48] <crimsun> slop: that's not an alsa (sound driver) issue. Which version of Flash are you using?
[12:49] <slop> crimsun, 9 beta
[12:49] <crimsun> slop: 9 beta 2?
[12:49] <slop> crimsun, ummm...not quite sure....i've downloaded the newest and replaced libflashplayer.so
[12:49] <Dev05> snype, I still don't get the point... Everything was right even though I had removed all those packages. The issue appeard with the NetworkManager install/remove... I'll be right back.
[12:49] <crimsun> slop: why not uninstall flashplugin-nonfree and use the version in -backports?
[12:50] <snype> Dev05
[12:50] <slop> crimsun, backports?
[12:50] <crimsun> slop: yes, -backports

[12:51] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[12:51] <Enzoblue> Jowi: ok, in order to get it to work, I need an essid and p/w apparently...
[12:51] <snype> how do i get glxgears to output fps?
[12:51] <Dev05> I'll be right back.
[12:52] <diogo> Hi
[12:52] <lor|Ron> snype: Its possible, some people in my cnet class have done it, Christmas break just started so I wouldnt get to ask them until Jan :( Wanted to know if there were any other guides to install without a CD but the ISO. Someone said use Daemon tools...
[12:52] <snype> hey
[12:52] <diogo> Anybody here owns a Nokia S60 or N-series, and used usb-cable connection?
[12:52] <snype> lor|Ron cnet class?
[12:52] <slop> crimsun, how do i get the backports version?
[12:52] <lor|Ron> computer networking
[12:52] <Jowi> Enzoblue, ESSID is the network name of the wireless router/AP that you want to connect to, so yes. that you need.
[12:53] <snype> oh hahah i thought it was like cnet.com training
[12:53] <lor|Ron> Haha
[12:53] <snype> lor|Ron basically if its possible u'd do it like this:
[12:53] <snype> boot off the old cd
[12:53] <leny> Dimensions: if you know how to mount a disk, then all you do is mount your regular drive. do a 'sudo chroot <where its mounted>' then issue a "grub-install '(hd0)' " assuming you installed to the first hard disk.
[12:53] <snype> mount the ntfs harddrive
[12:53] <Enzoblue> Jowi: ugh.. but what router? isn't it supposed to just search for wifi connects?
[12:53] <pluma> Is there a F/OSS equivalent of Windows Movie Maker?
[12:54] <snype> then there's a way to mount the iso as a virtual drive (like alcohol 120% in windows)
[12:54] <DARKGuy> How do I activate NVAGP so it stops using AGPART ?
[12:54] <snype> then maybe just navigate over to the desktop on that drive and then run the install script
[12:54] <snype> or you could just extract the iso
[12:54] <Jowi> Enzoblue, if it will find any in your area it will show the names in the network-manager icon. then you can just click on the essid you wand to connect to.
[12:54] <pluma> Or at least a free-as-in-beer equivalent of that Mac equivalent?
[12:54] <lor|Ron> snype: Yeah, searched for a bit but cant find any programs that do mounting. And even if I mounted, how would I execute the installer of the new iso?
[12:54] <Dimensions> leny ... i was lookin aroun web found a link which says make a directory in /mnt and then mount the linux drive to it which i did
[12:55] <Turner> chances if liveboot didn't detect my soundcard, after I install it wont either?
[12:55] <snype> u dont have to mount-- try just extracting the ISO as if it were .zip
[12:55] <Enzoblue> Jowi: ok, but the network-manager is still showing no device found =(
[12:55] <lor|Ron> Hmm
[12:55] <snype> the mounting is done w/o a program its just a mount command
[12:55] <lor|Ron> Ah >.<
[12:56] <snype> mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/iso
=== _greenie__ is now known as _greenie
[12:56] <Dimensions> then it says do sudo grub-install --configure-file=/mnt/hda1/boot/grub/menu.lst /dev/hda (give error unrec command --configure ....
[12:56] <snype> lor|ron here's the command: mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/iso
[12:56] <lor|Ron> Filename.iso can be /media/xp/blahblah correct?
[12:56] <Dimensions> leny ...
[12:56] <leny> Dimensions: then open Applcations > Accessories > Terminal  .  In it type "sudo chroot /mnt" then "grub-install '(hd0)' "  less the " of course.
[12:56] <Jowi> Enzoblue, check in "sudo network-admin". click on the wireless connection you activated, click on properties. click on the downarrow next to "Network name (ESSID)" and see if any networks are autodetected there.
[12:57] <snype> lor|Ron yes /media/xp/blahblha/something.iso
[12:57] <nolimitsoya_> im trying toinstall a minolta 2300w laser, and driver recog seems fine throughout installation, 'till i click apply. the installer closes without adding the printer and outputs this to terminal -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36159/ - any ideas?
[12:57] <snype> cause ntfs is read only---- same thing with a cdrom drive!
[12:57] <steven_> how do i mount a NTFS partition in ubuntu ???
[12:57] <lor|Ron> snype: Thanks, Ill go give it a try.
[12:57] <jrib> !ntfs | steven_
[12:57] <ubotu> steven_: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[12:57] <Enzoblue> Jowi: no, nothing there
[12:57] <snype> steven_ should mount automatically
[12:57] <snype> lor|Ron no prob man!
[12:57] <Dimensions> leny it says ... chroot: can't run command /bin/bash no such file or diretory ...
[12:57] <steven_> snype: i cant write on it
[12:57] <lor|Ron> steven_: sudo mkdir /media/windows
[12:57] <lor|Ron> sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /media/windows
[12:58] <Rydstedt> My first boot from the dapper live CD freezes right after regestring a usb to some number.. just locks up. how can i debug it?
[12:58] <snype> steven_ that's seperate
[12:58] <Jowi> Enzoblue, when click on the arrow it list 6 networks in my area. one is open and the other 5 locked. maybe there are no wireless networks nearby then.
[12:58] <FatherLavaGuard> Hi I've got a Maxtor USB HDD and would like to have write permission to it. Any hints or tips?
[12:58] <leny> type 'exit'
[12:58] <steven_> lor|Ron: i cant write
[12:58] <Enzoblue> Jowi: ok.. lemme run upstairs, my brother's laptop gets a wifi there
[12:58] <steven_> :)
[12:59] <Jowi> Enzoblue, you can restart the computer to make sure everything is ok after you installed the network-manager but I think it should be ok.
[12:59] <Dimensions> leny exit would close terminal ...
[12:59] <purebad> I am trying to install the openssh-server package, but when I run: sudo apt-get install openssh-server, it tells me the package is not avaiable, what should I do?
[01:00] <raindog_> With the Edgy install disk do I have to reformat my root partition that currently contains Dapper or will it just install right over top of it?
[01:00] <leny> Dimensions: Yeah try another terminal your chroot is wrong if you have your disk mounted as /mnt/hda1 it should be chroot /mnt/hda1
[01:00] <nolimitsoya_> im trying to install a minolta 2300w laser, and driver recog seems fine throughout installation, 'till i click apply. the installer closes without adding the printer and outputs this to terminal -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36159/ - any ideas?
[01:00] <FatherLavaGuard> |help
[01:00] <Dimensions> it is mounted thre just checked my mnt ...
[01:00] <Dimensions> i have my terminal again opened now ... leny
[01:01] <Rydstedt> my boot locks up right after ohci_hcd 0000:00:13.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
[01:01] <Rydstedt> why?
[01:01] <newbie0057> Hi, I can't install from the CD,, The screen resolution is too low and I can't click the buttons at the bottom of the screen,,, what should I do?
[01:01] <leny> Dimensions: does "ls /mnt" show the directories "bin" and "boot"
[01:02] <Enzoblue> Jowi: i don't know.. no connects and it still says no device found..
[01:02] <nolimitsoya_> !alternate | newbie0057
[01:02] <ubotu> newbie0057: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[01:02] <noelferreira> hi peolpe anyone with rt61 wireless driver working with edgy amd64?
[01:02] <newbie0057> can I just change the screen resolution ?
[01:02] <Jowi> Enzoblue, restart and try again. your wireless card is activated so it should not say "no device found"
[01:02] <Dimensions> leny .... just did as u said ...
[01:03] <newbie0057> I tried but the the option is 640x480
[01:03] <Dev05> snype, It's still as bad.
[01:03] <Dimensions> grub-install '(hd0)' command gives sudo unable to lookup ubuntu via gethostbyname
[01:04] <snype> Dev05 my sugestion----- download iso and reinstall
[01:04] <tkup> is anybody having a dependency problem installing dia on breezy?
[01:04] <adaptr> newbie0057: have you tried pressing control-alt-numplus ?
[01:04] <Dev05> snype, Yeah, that's exactly what I had in mind but... It's also just what I don't want to do :)
[01:04] <Pelo> I have this line in my grub  menu.lst file and I'm getting a message that the image cannot be found  any suggestion ?  splashimage=(hd1,0)/boot/grub/29964-ubuntuEL.xpm.gz
[01:04] <DisturbedFan3214> Is ubuntu better than windows 200?
[01:05] <DisturbedFan3214> 2000?
[01:05] <newbie0057> adaptr,, no,, Just did and nothing happened
[01:05] <snype> just think of it as fun!
[01:05] <gn1> http://www.freego.it/news/show/1503
[01:05] <adaptr> newbie0057: tricky, as I just earlier learned that you need at least 800x600 to even install it...
[01:05] <snype> or get another distro to try--- i did that today. tried xubuntu i love it so much more!
[01:05] <leny> Dimensions:  lets go back to the begining what is in the mnt directory you're using?
[01:05] <Rydstedt> how can i debug the dapper boot?
[01:05] <raindog_> Upgrading from Dapper to Edgy using Edgy disk:  will it reformat my root partition or just install over Dapper??
[01:05] <Dev05> snype, It'll be the 8th time! No, it's too much, a really bad reputation! :)
[01:05] <Dimensions> leny ... i have all folders which normally ubuntu has ...
[01:05] <newbie0057> adaptr: the screen is capable of more,, I don't know why the boot up CD choose this
[01:05] <snype> Dev05 reputation?
[01:06] <Dimensions> i mean /root /bin /sbin /boot etc etc
[01:06] <Dev05> snype, That doesn't exist in English?
[01:06] <Dimensions> i can actually see my menu.lst in grub leny
[01:06] <adaptr> newbie0057: neither, unfortunately, do I... the boot system is usually pretty smart at this stuff
[01:07] <leny> Then from a fresh terminal does sudo chroot <that mount>   work?
[01:07] <nolimitsoya_> im trying to install a minolta 2300w laser, and driver recog seems fine throughout installation, 'till i click apply. the installer closes without adding the printer and outputs this to terminal -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36159/ - any ideas?
[01:07] <newbie0057> adaptr: ok I'll do the alternate install,,, thanks !!
[01:07] <Dimensions> leny the first command did work ... chroot one ... but second one ... grub install hd0 gave that message that sudo unable to lookup ubuntu via gethostbyname()
[01:09] <leny> Dimensions: you don't need a sudo on the second one... are you trying it just as it is with the single ' around the '(hd0)' like that?
[01:09] <snype> anyone here using ubuntu?
[01:09] <nolimitsoya_> snype, no
[01:09] <snype> hahah ****xubuntu

[01:14] <einPaul> dm... start the theme config utility
[01:14] <leny> Dimensions: From an another terminal do a 'mount' it will be listed there.
[01:14] <nolimitsoya_> im trying to install a minolta 2300w laser, and driver recog seems fine throughout installation, 'till i click apply. the installer closes without adding the printer and outputs this to terminal -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36159/ - any ideas?
[01:14] <einPaul> then (if i remember correctly) there should be an add / install theme... then select the file you downloaded
[01:14] <nolimitsoya_> snype, then do the same for the transpiracy option, or what ever you find.
[01:14] <einPaul> or I could be totally wrong :-)
[01:14] <BigCanOfTuna> Can I change the uid/gid of a user?
[01:15] <snype> nolimitsoya_ thats the point there is no transparency

[01:17] <Tuxguy> I burnt the Xubuntu-ppc image to a disc, popped it into my mac, and it says "disc not readable" although the md5sum checked, and so does mounting it in linux
[01:18] <einPaul> oh darn, i start answering questions when the people are gone...
[01:18] <felixjet> anyone know the channel of the admins in this server?
[01:18] <Dimensions> leny ... from another window if i do ls /dev/hd* it should i have hda1 etc etc ... but when i do pwd in same window it also says i am in /dev but title says i am in /mnt/hda1
[01:18] <Jowi> cmt^^, i do not know which version edgy uses, but 0.8 is quite old and dapper uses 0.10.
[01:19] <jordan_> after upgrading to from dapper to edgy, my boot process pauses on "Running /scripts/local-top" for a long time (about 5 minutes).  does anyone know why this is happening?
[01:19] <Jowi> need to sleep. night all
[01:19] <e-squizo> hi everybody.. I have an ubuntu system I was trying to upgrade to Dapper (from Breezy)
[01:20] <nerdzyboy> never mind my question
[01:20] <e-squizo> unfortunately, the power failed near the end... now I seem to be missing stuff such as ifrename

[01:20] <s|k> I just installed epiphany on my computer but I can't find it
[01:20] <s|k> in fact I just did ls -R epiphany* from root directory
[01:20] <s|k> and it found nothing
[01:20] <Enzoblue> jowi: ok, this is the thing. It says either put in my router's essid (which I don't have a router) or "if my card supports scanning" choose an essid form the dropdown. I know this card supports scanning, but there's nothing in the dropdown.
[01:20] <e-squizo> is there a safe way to reinstall the system without touching /home (which is *not* on a separate partition?
[01:20] <s|k> can someone tell me how I can find this thing I just installed?
[01:21] <mnoir> s|k: how did you install it?
[01:21] <felixjet> anyone know the channel of the admins in this server?
[01:21] <s|k> mnoir: via apt
[01:21] <leny> Dimensions:  From what you're saying your current terminal is in the wrong place close all your terminals and start with a new one. Then do just 'mount' and look for /mnt<perhaps something> there.
[01:21] <s|k> it said it installed it
[01:21] <mnoir> then use the apt command to look for what files are in the package or better yet, use synaptic
[01:22] <Enzoblue> jowi: thing is, in network-admin, under the DNS tab, there's my brother's wifi address in the "search domains" box...
[01:22] <s|k> mnoir what is the apt command?
[01:22] <Flannel> s|k: whereis epiphany
[01:22] <Dimensions> leny it says /dev/hda1 on /mnt/hda1 type ext3 (rw)
[01:23] <shingoki> how can I stop different users from being able to see each other's files?
[01:23] <mnoir> the apt command is what you used to install it, probably
[01:23] <jordan_> does anyone know what the /scripts/local-top script does?
[01:23] <kevinh90> hello
[01:23] <mnoir> or use 'type' or 'whereis'
=== felixjet is now known as felixjet3
[01:24] <Enzoblue> jowi: but at least network manager is showing a device now :)
[01:24] <leny> Dimensions: Then do a "chroot /mnt/hda1" then on the next line a "grub-install '(hd0)'"
[01:24] <Flannel> shingoki: they usually cant.  Where are you having troubles?
[01:24] <shingoki> Flannel: by "see" I mean list directories, etc.
[01:24] <s|k> hrm it says I installed a clone of boulder dash

[01:25] <linuxgoober> i have /dev/hdb1 mounted as /home/rnisly/hdb but only root has can do anything with it how do i change it from the command line?
[01:25] <Dimensions> okay leny with chroot i get root .. then gave grub-install '(hd0)' gives message /dev/hda1 Not found not a block device
[01:26] <nothlit> Allen, you're telling someone to use find on the root directory? why not locate
[01:26] <shingoki> Flannel: any idea how to stop that?
[01:26] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working wiht edgy amd64?
[01:26] <Flannel> shingoki: they mustve screwed up their own permissions.  Since home folders are set to not be able to be world readable
[01:26] <shingoki> Flannel: I just created this new user with the tool thingy
[01:27] <shingoki> "Users and Groups"
[01:27] <Dimensions> linuxgoober u can change ownership to ur current user by sudo chown -R urusername:root /path/to/folder
[01:27] <linuxgoober> ok thankyou
[01:27] <shingoki> Flannel: how would I create a new user with its files not visible by other users?
[01:27] <Flannel> shingoki: right, and what are the perms for his home dir? (ls -l /home/)
[01:27] <PriceChild> Ok... can someone tell me how people are managing to install 386 kernels on edgy and feisty? I thought there is only generic now. Its really confusing how they're getting their nvidia prop drivers running on 386 but not generic, when they follow the instructions i give them.
[01:28] <Flannel> PriceChild: there's generic and 386
[01:28] <PriceChild> Flannel: how come?
[01:28] <shingoki> Flannel: drwxr-xr-x
[01:28] <leny> Dimensions: I'm at a loss as to why, this very procedure worked for me yesterday.  Try quitting that window, if following the website didin't work I'll have to hand you over
[01:28] <Flannel> PriceChild: because some older 386 processors don't work well with the generic kernel
[01:28] <mnoir> s|k: epiphany installs in /usr/games
[01:28] <PriceChild> Flannel: thanks
[01:29] <Dimensions> ummm....
[01:29] <nothlit> is the users group automatically populated by users with uid> 1000/that are user added?
[01:30] <shingoki> Flannel: ah I see what you mean - ok I did a recursive chmod to get rid of permissions for "a" and "o" but not "x", presumably that is ok?
[01:30] <Flannel> shingoki: just remove the read and execute bits for others on that
[01:30] <s|k> mnoir: thanks, I meant to install the browser :(
[01:30] <Flannel> shingoki: group should be ok to leave
[01:30] <shingoki> Flannel: cool, thanks
[01:31] <mnoir> :)
[01:31] <Allen> s|k : lol, synaptic time
[01:31] <Flannel> shingoki: and, recursive wasn't what you wanted.  Just the /home/username/
[01:31] <shingoki> Flannel: yeah I just realised that
[01:31] <shingoki> Flannel: ah well
[01:31] <mnoir> synaptic will easily list all the contents (in future)
[01:31] <Dimensions> thanks alot leny ... :) will try to grab someone else prolly ...
[01:32] <mnoir> just turn on show package properties in main page in preferences
[01:32] <leny> Dimensions:  Sorry to take your time up.. anyway is 00:30 UK time and time for me to sleep. Rgds - Leny
[01:33] <shingoki> Flannel: heh I am breaking stuff merrily now - I deleted the user and his home directory, then recreated user, and his home directory wasn't created
[01:33] <Dimensions> any one around can help restoring grub ???
[01:33] <jordan_> does anyone know why /scripts/local-top" takes over 5 minutes to finish during bootup?  does this have anything to do with my raid setup?
[01:33] <jordan_> this only started happening since i upgraded to edgy
[01:33] <atento> hi suckers
[01:33] <soundray> Dimensions: have you tried the wiki instructions?
[01:34] <atento> i sad hello suckers
[01:34] <Dimensions> soundray there is one i could find from ubuntuforums ... where i reach to this line sudo grub-install --config-file=/mnt/hda2/boot/grub/menu.lst /dev/hda
[01:34] <atento> i to u
[01:34] <Dimensions> it gives error ... with config-file ... etc etc ...
[01:34] <atento> ::
[01:35] <soundray> Dimensions: what environment are you running this from?
[01:36] <shingoki> Flannel: ok I think I've fixed it, thanks, cya :)
[01:36] <Flannel> !grub | Dimensions
[01:36] <ubotu> Dimensions: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[01:36] <Flannel> Dimensions: first link there
[01:37] <Dimensions> soundray and another one which also leny ( a user here ) told me to follow was sudo grub-install '(hd0)' which says not found or not a block device ... which my mount command says /mnt/hda1 /dev/hda1 ext3 type (rw)
[01:37] <ColonelZarkawi> gnome-terminal shows ugly true type fonts in edgy what should I do
[01:37] <nothlit> jordan_, man initramfs-tools
[01:37] <soundray> Dimensions: do you have separate boot and root partitions?
[01:37] <nothlit> ColonelZarkawi, go change the font
[01:38] <nothlit> ColonelZarkawi, or system preferences font and choose your antialiasing preferences
[01:38] <ColonelZarkawi> nothlit, you missed my point. I *want* to use true type fonts.
[01:38] <ColonelZarkawi> nothlit, antialias is already set
[01:38] <Hail_Spacecake> I've a command line manipulation question
[01:38] <Dimensions> soundray i have been using this ubuntu on my office laptop for abt five months and got imp data ... it has /boot and /root partitions ... i have done like lets say abt 100 installations of ubuntu let alone other os ...
[01:39] <Jammie> anyone know how to enable direct render on an i810 chipset?
[01:39] <Hail_Spacecake> I want to rm all the files in a certain directory that have been created in the past n days
[01:39] <soundray> Dimensions: is this relevant?
[01:39] <nothlit> ColonelZarkawi, you said the true type fonts were uly
[01:39] <ColonelZarkawi> nothlit, yes, they were shown correctly in dapper
[01:39] <nothlit> ColonelZarkawi, just install them, the easiest way is in ~/.fonts
[01:39] <Hail_Spacecake> I did find -ctime 0 | rm
[01:39] <ColonelZarkawi> nothlit, in edgy they look ugly
[01:39] <Hail_Spacecake> and it returned an error
[01:39] <jrib> Hail_Spacecake: ext3 file system does not keep track of creation time
[01:39] <Dimensions> well what i mean to say is ... i am not newbie to ubuntu and etc ...
[01:39] <ColonelZarkawi> nothlit, in dapper they look fine
[01:39] <ColonelZarkawi> nothlit, they are already installed
[01:39] <Hail_Spacecake> huh? then why does find -ctime n work?
[01:40] <nothlit> ColonelZarkawi, are you sure best shapes is enabled?
[01:40] <ColonelZarkawi> nothlit, yes
[01:40] <Hail_Spacecake> I can get a list of all the files I want to delete with find -ctime n
[01:40] <jrib> Hail_Spacecake: ctime is not creation time
[01:40] <Flannel> Dimensions: Did you read that page?  it covers multiple installation methods
[01:40] <Hail_Spacecake> what is it then?
[01:40] <keeganX> How can I make my icons smaller in my Menu?
[01:40] <guerrero> anybody know how to low level reverse video X...i would like the whole frame buffer to be reverse videod...is that possible?
=== cappicard_ is now known as cappicard
[01:40] <soundray> Dimensions: I see, it's not relevant then ;)
[01:40] <jrib> Hail_Spacecake: "change time"
[01:40] <guerrero> with hacking
[01:40] <guerrero> without hacking
[01:40] <Hail_Spacecake> jrib: so, it's the equivalent of windows "modified date"?
[01:40] <soundray> Dimensions: let's focus on the problem
[01:40] <ColonelZarkawi> so?
[01:41] <jrib> Hail_Spacecake: idk what windows does with that, see http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/ctime_atime_mtime.html
[01:41] <Dimensions> soundray ... answer is yes ... /root and /boot plus i can see my mounted hda1 into /mnt/hda1 and grub menu.lst ...
[01:41] <Hail_Spacecake> well, in any case, find -ctime got me the right list of files
[01:41] <Jammie> anyone know where or how to enable direct rendering on a i810 chipset?
[01:41] <Dimensions> Flannel i am lookin at it .. :)
[01:41] <Flannel> Dimensions: sounds good ;)
[01:41] <Hail_Spacecake> I just want to know why I can't pipe that list to rm and have all those files deleted
[01:41] <ColonelZarkawi> Hail_Spacecake, find -ctime | xargs -i rm -f \{\}
[01:42] <jrib> Hail_Spacecake: try find -searchforwhatever -exec rm '{}' \;
[01:42] <ColonelZarkawi> yeah
[01:42] <soundray> Dimensions: when you did the sudo grub-install above, was the menu.lst actually in /mnt/hda2/boot/grub/ ?
[01:42] <ColonelZarkawi> I love the \; at the end of exec
[01:42] <Dimensions> soundray it was in /mnt/hda1/boot/grub
[01:42] <ColonelZarkawi> makes so much sense
[01:43] <soundray> Dimensions: did you just copy it wrong in the IRC window?
[01:43] <Jammie> ok thanks all for your wonderful help i thought this was a help channel not a chat channel ill go seek help from someone who knows what there doing
[01:43] <ColonelZarkawi> eclipse is slow on linux than in windows
[01:43] <ColonelZarkawi> why?
[01:43] <soundray> Bye Jammie :)
[01:43] <ColonelZarkawi> in ubuntu eclipse is way slower
[01:43] <ColonelZarkawi> same machine
[01:43] <ColonelZarkawi> any reason?
[01:43] <Dimensions> nah soundray why ?
[01:44] <pwk> hi guys

[01:44] <ColonelZarkawi> Spirit of the West - And If Venice Is Sinking
[01:44] <Hail_Spacecake> I tried | rm
[01:44] <nothlit> with the dash
[01:44] <ColonelZarkawi> Hail_Spacecake, I told you
[01:44] <ColonelZarkawi> Hail_Spacecake, find -ctime | xargs -i rm -f \{\}
[01:44] <pwk> i want ur guys opion on ubuntu..
[01:44] <pwk> i'm a newbie.. you think ubuntu be good?
[01:44] <soundray> Dimensions: you said 'sudo grub-install --config-file=/mnt/hda2/boot/grub/menu.lst /dev/hda' and then you said menu.lst was in /mnt/hda*1*...
[01:44] <pwk> also does it got glass effect ?
[01:44] <ColonelZarkawi> pwk, if you use dapper is fine, edgy is not that good
[01:44] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anyone install madwifi lately?
[01:45] <pwk> i got 6.10 here
[01:45] <Hail_Spacecake> ah, that did it
[01:45] <Hail_Spacecake> thanks
[01:45] <Spaghetti_Knife> And anyone know how to install the apt file?
[01:45] <ColonelZarkawi> okidoki Hail_Spacecake
[01:45] <Allen> pwk: what do you mean "glass effect"?
[01:45] <Dimensions> soundray that link i had copied from web ... i used hda1 instead ...
[01:45] <soundray> Dimensions: so I'm wondering at what stage that hda1/hda2 discrepancy crept in
[01:45] <pwk> i thoguht linux versions had glass
[01:45] <soundray> Dimensions: okay.
[01:45] <pwk> sec
[01:45] <Knome> how do i mount a drive so it is accessible to evry1 not just root?
[01:45] <Dimensions> but it gave error from --config ...
[01:45] <soundray> Dimensions: so which is your boot and which is your root partition?
[01:45] <Allen> spaghetti_knife, i did about a month ago, why
[01:46] <nothlit> !beryl | pwk
[01:46] <ubotu> pwk: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[01:46] <cntb> !opengl
[01:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about opengl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen: Could you guide me through the process? The forums guide to installing madwifi is outdated.
[01:46] <Dimensions> soundray my linux partition disk is hda1 atm which is mounted to /mnt/hda1 and all /boot /root etc are located at /mnt/hda1 folder ...
[01:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen: Plz? It'd make me grateful forever and evar.
[01:46] <cntb> nvidia-glx installed
[01:46] <cntb> howto test opengl  ?
[01:46] <ColonelZarkawi> with an opengl game
[01:47] <cntb> like dxdiag
[01:47] <soundray> Dimensions: okay, and which one is your separate boot partition?
[01:47] <Knome> how do i mount a drive so you can access it without root
[01:47] <ColonelZarkawi> Knome, install pmount
[01:47] <pwk> i'm testing ubntu in vmware.. to beome famillar with it
[01:47] <cntb> ColonelZarkawi, tuxracer shows no koy
[01:47] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen: which site did you use for Madwifi?
[01:47] <ColonelZarkawi> Knome, it will mount it automatically for you
[01:47] <Spaghetti_Knife> allen
[01:47] <Dimensions> thats live cd ... which i removed and am doing with alternate atm ..
[01:47] <pwk> i'm getting low wirless conection...
[01:47] <pwk> tyyl's
[01:47] <pwk> thxs alot
[01:47] <einPaul> glxgears cntb
[01:47] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen: The otaku42 site is down.
[01:47] <cntb> btw what is this nick ColonelZarkawi
[01:48] <Knome> <ColonelZarkawi>: ok
[01:48] <cntb> tyvm einPaul
[01:48] <ColonelZarkawi> cntb, that's my nick, why?
[01:48] <Allen> spaghetti_kife, give me a sec, im in the middle of something
[01:48] <einPaul> cntb, it wont exactly tell you if everything is allright... but if it's choppy, it's probably not right
[01:48] <soundray> Dimensions: do you have a separate partition on any of your hard disk drives which you mount to the mountpoint /boot ?
[01:48] <schisms> What media player do you guys use?
[01:48] <schisms> I need one with good performance.
[01:48] <ColonelZarkawi> schisms, mplayer
[01:48] <ColonelZarkawi> schisms, mplayer has good performance
[01:48] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working wiht edgy amd64?
[01:48] <s1`_> is there a graphic tool for managing harddrives and mounting stuff in ubuntu?
[01:48] <cntb> so ? einPaul ? nvidia must show logo on restart
[01:49] <cntb> Iknow other install did
[01:49] <ColonelZarkawi> s1`_, pmount is all you need to mount stuff
[01:49] <Knome> ColonelZarkawi: it's alredy installed, and the drive dosn,t automatically mount
[01:49] <ColonelZarkawi> s1`_, it will do it automatically
[01:49] <linuxgoober> what file format is best for mp3s? reiserfs?
[01:49] <cntb> einPaul, glxgears not in repo
[01:49] <nothlit> yeah reiser is great for lots of little files
[01:49] <ColonelZarkawi> Knome, I forgot to mention pmount is intended for removable devices (i.e cdroms, etc) are you trying to mount a removable device?
[01:50] <s1`_> ColonelZarkawi, I have nfs-mounts I'd like to edit
[01:50] <linuxgoober> ok thx
[01:50] <Dimensions> nah the seperate partition i have is of windows
[01:50] <soundray> linuxgoober: reiserfs is not a file format
[01:50] <Knome> ColonelZarkawi: no, a windows ntfs drive
[01:50] <nothlit> linuxgoober, if you want the most storage space, i'd stick with ext3 tho
[01:50] <einPaul> well... it should show the logo on restart
[01:50] <s1`_> I can do it via fstab, but I wondered if there was a good gui for it
[01:50] <Dimensions> which isn't mounted
[01:50] <schisms> mplayer is more for movies though.
[01:50] <schisms> I mean music.
[01:50] <soundray> Dimensions: so you don't have separate boot and root partitions?
[01:51] <ColonelZarkawi> reiser is great but he is in jail
[01:51] <schisms> Something like xmms(sp) for fedora
[01:51] <einPaul> but you can turn that off if you want cntb
[01:51] <ColonelZarkawi> brb
[01:51] <nolimitsoya> ColonelZarkawi, i beg to differ. :) reiser is riddled with problems, and has been since the beginning
[01:51] <nolimitsoya> *-n
[01:51] <rubix_> with an ipod nano i have it mounted and have gtkpod installed but for some reason it isn't registering
[01:52] <Dimensions> soundray ... i have one root and boot partition on my hdd ubuntu installed and one is of livecd ...
[01:52] <nolimitsoya> rubix_, try amarok instead. i never got gtkpod working...
[01:52] <ColonelZarkawi> nolimitsoya, that's ok there are more robust filesystems than reiser
[01:52] <squeakypants> hey hey hey
[01:52] <soundray> Dimensions: do you know the difference between a partition and a directory?
[01:52] <ColonelZarkawi> xfs
[01:52] <Knome> ColonelZarkawi: ne suggestiones??
[01:52] <ericb> has anyone played starcraft using cedega?
[01:52] <squeakypants> what's the fastest way to install all the compilers and shit?
[01:52] <nolimitsoya> ColonelZarkawi, fex, but i prefer jfs2
[01:52] <cntb> glad too see how einPaul
[01:52] <squeakypants> like what should I select in synaptic
[01:52] <lemonsCC> !partition
[01:52] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[01:53] <ColonelZarkawi> squeakypants, I don't know of any way to install shit fast in ubuntu dude
[01:53] <ColonelZarkawi> squeakypants, but for compilers, build-essential is all you need
[01:53] <lemonsCC> !language
[01:53] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:53] <einPaul> cntb, I don't understand
[01:53] <squeakypants> colonelzarkawi: thx
[01:53] <ColonelZarkawi> no problem dude
[01:53] <FFForever> how can i run aqua?
[01:53] <ericb> Does anyone have any experience with Stracraft and Cedega?
[01:53] <einPaul> cntb, Did you restart?
[01:53] <squeakypants> exactly what I was thinking of :)
[01:53] <ColonelZarkawi> FFForever, on a mac
[01:53] <rubix_> nolimitsoya: ok thx
[01:53] <Allen> spaghetti_knife, this should work just fine for you http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=madwifi-ng
[01:53] <Allen> im out, peace
[01:53] <schisms> I was thinking of getting cedega.
[01:54] <FFForever> how can i run aqua on ubuntu?
[01:54] <schisms> How is it?
[01:54] <soundray> FFForever: under Mac OS X
[01:54] <lemonsCC> XNU?
[01:54] <cntb> I need games for 11 yrs old kid
[01:54] <soundray> FFForever: not on Ubuntu. It's closed source
[01:54] <cntb> restart several times no joy
[01:54] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen:Thanks.
[01:54] <squeakypants> ffforever: as a theme for gnome or kde
[01:54] <FFForever> ok aqua clone?
[01:54] <ericb> It seems pretty good so far, very user-friendly
[01:54] <MSTK> hey guys.
[01:54] <FFForever> is there a wm?
[01:54] <einPaul> what guide did you use to install the drivers?
[01:54] <ericb> but I can't get starcraft to work =/
[01:54] <ColonelZarkawi> FFForever, there are "Aqua Themes", they all look like crap compared with the original mac aqua
[01:54] <MSTK> i'm considering switching from Windows to Ubuntu
[01:54] <cntb> how do I configure xorg.conf
[01:55] <cntb> !xorg
[01:55] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[01:55] <squeakypants> cntb: to do what?
[01:55] <ColonelZarkawi> FFForever, xfce has aqua theme, gnome has aqua theme, kde has aqua theme, none look as good as the real aqu
[01:55] <soundray> cntb: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[01:55] <lemonsCC> cntb: dpgk-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[01:55] <Menisk> I need help installing a driver i found on the internet for a usb adsl modem and i havent got the internet on the computer i need to install it on can somene help?
[01:55] <Menisk> i think i need to compile it into the kernel
[01:55] <cntb> soundray, tyvm nvidia-glx installed
[01:55] <schisms> I can never configure my x-server right.
[01:55] <Dimensions> what is your question soundray ... i told you i have one other parition for my windows ... and i do not have any other parition ... i have my /root /boot directories of my live cd and ubuntu installed
[01:55] <ericb> is there a way to permanently log in instead of having to do sudo all the time?
[01:55] <Menisk> the site i found the driver at is http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/
[01:56] <lemonsCC> sudo -s
[01:56] <soundray> Dimensions: you told me earlier you had separate root and boot partitions... ??
[01:56] <cntb> soundray, will 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' put opengl for me ?
[01:56] <FFForever> is there a aqua wm clone?, just not a theme but an actual wm
[01:56] <Dimensions> eracc sudo -i
[01:56] <ericb> oh ok, ty :)

[01:58] <echosystm> i am having nothing but headaches isntalling gnome on ubuntu server
[01:58] <FFForever> can i run darwin on ubuntu?
[01:58] <ColonelZarkawi> FFForever, no
[01:58] <lemonsCC> its open-source so maybe
[01:58] <echosystm> could it be something to do with the kernel?
[01:58] <ColonelZarkawi> FFForever, or yes maybe
[01:58] <Dimensions> soundray <soundray> Dimensions: so which is your boot and which is your root partition? if you meant OS my boot os is windows atm other than that i donno why did u call parition to boot and root ..
[01:58] <FFForever> if i run darwin can i run aqua?
[01:59] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, what sort of problems?
[01:59] <ValMarko> I love Ubuntu!!!
[01:59] <MSTK> hey guys.  i'm considering switching from windows to Ubuntu.  but i have a couple of questions.  does anyone mind helping?
[01:59] <lemonsCC> FFForever: http://developer.apple.com/opensource/index.html
[01:59] <cntb> noth sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart ?
[01:59] <echosystm> im still having that quit window problem
[01:59] <ColonelZarkawi> FFForever, I think is easier if you buy macos
[01:59] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, as i told you, fire away
[01:59] <echosystm> that we spoke about last night
[01:59] <FFForever> im poor
[01:59] <Menisk> I need help installing a driver i found on the internet for a usb adsl modem and i havent got the internet on the computer i need to install it on can somene help?
[01:59] <Menisk>  I think i need to compile it into the kernel i found the driver at accessrunner.sourceforge.net
[01:59] <ericb> MSTK, what are they?
[01:59] <MSTK> oh
[01:59] <nolimitsoya> !ask | MSTK
[01:59] <ubotu> MSTK: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:59] <MSTK> well
[01:59] <cntb> nothlit,  sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart ?
[01:59] <lemonsCC> FFForever: Darwin is based on FreeBSD 5.0 start there
[01:59] <FFForever> i dont even have a dollar lol
[01:59] <echosystm> i didnt even install the nvidia driver this time
[01:59] <MSTK> will I still be able to run windows apps?
[01:59] <biggz20> Can someone help me change my refresh rate?
[01:59] <MSTK> at least on maybe an emulator service
[01:59] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, no
[01:59] <biggz20> is 75ghz to high for a tv?
[01:59] <soundray> Dimensions: okay, so you haven't set up a separate partition for boot then.
[01:59] <biggz20> 75hz
[01:59] <biggz20> wont 60 be better?
[02:00] <MSTK> is there anything like a Virtual PC or Wine?
[02:00] <ColonelZarkawi> FFForever, there are plenty of warez sites :):) HAHAHAHA
[02:00] <echosystm> im thinking maybe i should just use the alternate cd and do a minimal install from there
[02:00] <nothlit> cntb, yeah the ? will automatically work though :P
[02:00] <FFForever> ....
[02:00] <FFForever> i dont support warez and i think its bad
[02:00] <soundray> Dimensions: and your Ubuntu is on /dev/hda1. Which one is the Windows one?
[02:00] <vader> one quick fast question, is there a non lice cd version of 6.06?
[02:00] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, there are application compatibility layers like wine, but they usualy dont work the way you want them to. thats no ptoblem though, you can usualy find a unix/linux program that does the same thing as your windows app
[02:00] <Dimensions> soundray windows is on hda3 .... and hda1 is ubuntu ...
[02:00] <biggz20> FFForever, can you help me change my refresh rate?
[02:00] <FirstStrike> so..who knows anything about diamoned inheritance in C?
[02:00] <FFForever> i hate X lol so no :)
[02:01] <cntb> nothlit, Backed up file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' as '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'
[02:01] <MSTK> thanks
[02:01] <ColonelZarkawi> Filbert, C doesn't support inheritance directly
[02:01] <ActivE> I have a really nice theme for gnome which i would like to keep. However it uses white text which doesnt show up in some web forms. Is there any way i can change the font colour for the theme?
[02:01] <ColonelZarkawi> I  mean FirstStrike
[02:01] <MSTK> also, can i import my hard drive when installing?
[02:01] <MSTK> all my documents and things
[02:01] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, if there is something for which you realy _need_ windows, you can run it in vmware, which is free for linux
[02:01] <FirstStrike> tell me more ColonelZarkawi
[02:01] <biggz20> anyone?
[02:01] <FirstStrike> I've got a friend that's stuck
[02:01] <cntb> nothlit,  now Ctrl-Alt-Backspace enough ?
[02:01] <FirstStrike> she's emulating it
[02:01] <nothlit> cntb, yeah
[02:01] <ColonelZarkawi> Firetech, I tell you more if you tell me wth is "diamoned inheritance"
[02:01] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, no, youll have tomanualy move the files from your windows partition to you ubuntu partition
[02:01] <cntb> bbl
[02:02] <rubix_> nolimitsoya: how do you u use amarok to get music off a nano?
[02:02] <biggz20> can anyone  help with refresh rate?
[02:02] <james007> i have probelm..
[02:02] <biggz20> noot just a link to a site, but I have a few questions.
[02:02] <MSTK> can I do that all within Ubuntu, after I install?
[02:02] <james007> can anyone help?
[02:02] <Menisk> I need help installing a driver i found on the internet for a usb adsl modem and i havent got the internet on the computer i need to install it on can somene help?
[02:02] <Menisk>  I think i need to compile it into the kernel, the driver is from accessrunner.sourceforge.net
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> rubix_, use the media device tab :)
[02:02] <ColonelZarkawi> !ask
[02:02] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:02] <FirstStrike> ColonelZarkawi: base class A
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, define 'all' :)
[02:02] <ColonelZarkawi> james007, Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:02] <okaratas> !server
[02:02] <ubotu> Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current stable version is 6.06 LTS. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/
[02:02] <MSTK> as in
[02:02] <FirstStrike> classes B and C inherit from A. class D inherits from B & C
[02:02] <rubix_> nolimitsoya: right but the dev isn't showing up
[02:03] <MSTK> copy my windows files into my Ubuntu HD
[02:03] <soundray> Dimensions: can you boot the live CD and run 'sudo mount /dev/hda1 mnt ; sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/hda'
[02:03] <nolimitsoya> rubix_, odd :)
[02:03] <MSTK> without leaving an ubuntu session
[02:03] <ColonelZarkawi> FirstStrike, Isn't that multiple inheritance for D?
[02:03] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, yes you can
[02:03] <okaratas> !network
[02:03] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:03] <MSTK> oh.  well that's good news.  seems easy.
[02:03] <ericb> Starcraft... Cedega.... anyone? :(
[02:03] <MSTK> Ubuntu is open source, right?
[02:03] <ColonelZarkawi> FirstStrike, anyway C doesn't support inheritance of any kind
[02:04] <Menisk> mstk yes ubuntu is open source all linux distros are
[02:04] <ColonelZarkawi> FirstStrike, it can be simulated, like the gnome guys do
[02:04] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, though be aware that you should always have a full backup before messing with your partition table, so ubless you are installing ubuntu on a fresh, separate harddrive, youll have all your files on a disc anyway
[02:04] <ColonelZarkawi> FirstStrike, but then it looks like crap
[02:04] <soundray> Menisk: that's not entirely true
[02:04] <FirstStrike> ColonelZarkawi: she's emulating it. that's as much as i know.
[02:04] <MSTK> Okay.  So I have two internal Hard drives
[02:04] <FirstStrike> i'm not sure what she's doing, but it's a college project
[02:04] <ColonelZarkawi> FirstStrike, use C++ if you want to play with inheritance (C++ supports multiple inheritance)
[02:04] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, yes, ubuntu isopen source. not onlythat, but under a gpl license
[02:04] <james007> i have totaly empty computer, without any OS.. and i have linux unbuntu and it wont to be installed.. i had made a partitions, but installation wont proceed, because it dont recognize the partitions
[02:04] <graphyx> I am having issues updating perl CPAN in ubuntu.
[02:04] <graphyx> Has anyone had this issue before?
[02:04] <MSTK> I have two internal hard drives and i could possibly move everything into one if I delete or compress enough stuff.  Would that make things better or worse for installing Ubuntu?
[02:05] <FirstStrike> ColonelZarkawi: I don't think she can, since it's an assignment from her professor
[02:05] <nolimitsoya> james007, how did you create them? did you commit the changes?
[02:05] <ColonelZarkawi> Who is she?
[02:05] <echosystm> can you do a minimal install from the ubuntu desktop cd?
[02:05] <FirstStrike> my friend
[02:05] <echosystm> or do you have to use the alt cd
[02:05] <ColonelZarkawi> oh
[02:05] <echosystm> ??
[02:05] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, much better :)
[02:05] <rubix_> nolimitsoya: you have to configure the media device first right? its not recognizing my cdrom either
[02:05] <soundray> echosystm: the latter.
[02:05] <echosystm> ok
[02:05] <echosystm> thanks
[02:05] <nolimitsoya> rubix_, then i cant help you :)
[02:05] <MSTK> nolimitsoya - so how so?  how does the whole partition thing work anyway?
[02:05] <james007> anypne?
[02:06] <james007> anyone
[02:06] <james007> ?
[02:06] <ColonelZarkawi> FirstStrike, ok so probably she needs to simulate the inheritance in C i remember assigments of such kind when I was in the university, I crazy professor wanted to teach us generics with void * pointers. Crazy stuff

[02:06] <Menisk> Hey everybody, what do I need to do to get the USB ADSL modem drivers from http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net into my Ubuntu kernel? I don't have internet access on the box so I'll need to transfer the packages over somehow
[02:06] <FirstStrike> ColonelZarkawi: yea
[02:06] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, with a separate, clean harddrive or partition you dont have to resize existing partitions, which is _very_ dangerous
[02:06] <FirstStrike> ColonelZarkawi: want to see what her assignment is?
[02:06] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen:I went to the last line, where it says to type in "modprobe ath_pci", and it says FATAL: Error inserting ath_pci
[02:06] <czambran81> Does anybody know what the following error mean: Unknown interrupt or fault at EIP
[02:06] <shlajfka> lets strart from the begining
[02:06] <nothlit> echosystm, you need the alt/server cd
[02:06] <soundray> shlajfka: it's rude to ask a question and then change nicks
[02:06] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, the ubuntu installer will help you partition and format the drive you are going to install to
[02:06] <nothlit> echosystm, the server cd is a smaller image btw
[02:06] <ColonelZarkawi> FirstStrike, Sorry dude now I don't have too much time to look at it
[02:07] <MSTK> do I need to run a separate installer or process to create partitions?
[02:07] <FirstStrike> alright, thanks
[02:07] <shlajfka> sory..
[02:07] <soundray> shlajfka: I suspect you made a mistake during the partitioning stage.
[02:07] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, no, the installer will guide you

[02:08] <shlajfka> in the installation have a partition editor
[02:08] <Menisk>  Hey everybody, what do I need to do to get the USB ADSL modem drivers from http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net into my Ubuntu kernel? I don't have internet access on the box so I'll need to transfer the packages over somehow
[02:08] <graphyx> anyone good with perl and ubuntu?  I am getting an error upon updating CPAN/
[02:08] <soundray> shlajfka: when you've decided how you are going to partition, you have to hit 'Apply' to make it actually do it
[02:08] <graphyx> It is looking for settings for Module::Build

[02:19] <ubotu> cntb: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:19] <Dimensions> no :S i mean edit it for adding windows entry ?
[02:19] <schisms> The installation is straightforward.
[02:19] <cntb> fonts not found for one and nvidia not loaded
=== selzy_imut_ is now known as cew_cr_tTM^_^
[02:19] <soundray> shlajfka: have you booted the live CD now?
[02:19] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, not realy, as long as you are not planning to resize partitions, and you wherent
[02:19] <nothlit> !nvidia | cntb
[02:19] <soundray> Allz: wait your turn
[02:19] <cntb> nothlit: I went through wiki
[02:19] <soundray> Allz: or ask someone else
[02:19] <schisms> What do you plan to do with your partitions MSTK?
[02:19] <MSTK> after I install Ubuntu, will I be able to switch back and forth between Windows and Ubuntu by rebooting?
[02:19] <schisms> Yeah
[02:19] <MSTK> or is it locked into Ubuntu
[02:19] <cntb> worked OK on other PC w. legacy nvidia
[02:19] <rubix_> nolimitsoya: when you mount an ipod in linux does it reformat it?
[02:19] <nothlit> MSTK, if you do it correctly, yes
[02:19] <schisms> Make sure you make three partitions.
[02:19] <soundray> !dualboot | MSTK
[02:19] <ubotu> MSTK: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[02:19] <MSTK> and will I have to re-install Windows completely if it isn't?
[02:19] <shlajfka> mm. i am not on my comp.. but.. i should to boot up LIVE cd? i have booted up the other cd... all the time
[02:20] <schisms> One for windows
[02:20] <MSTK> oh, okay.  thanks guys
[02:20] <schisms> One for linux swap
[02:20] <schisms> And one for ubuntu.
[02:20] <MSTK> You guys are great.
[02:20] <cntb> here edgy and nvidia dev = 0110 mx400
[02:20] <schisms> I made my linux swap about 5 gigs.
[02:20] <schisms> Then it should install.
[02:20] <nolimitsoya> MSTK, if you at any point during installation feel uneasy just log on here and someone will play holding hands. :) ubuntu will install a boot loader that lets you choose if you want to start ubuntu orwindows on every boot
[02:20] <ColonelZarkawi> schisms, AHAHAAHAHAHAAH
[02:20] <Elendil> Hello, when i try to boot up ubuntu, after it goes through teh loading screen, my screens blacken and say out of sync. Can someone help me on this problem? and also i tryed running in the graphic safe mode.
[02:20] <schisms> I can spare it man
[02:20] <nothlit> cntb, well obviously nvidia isn't loading properly and since you used the configuration tool xorg.conf is fine, that leaves the installation, maybe its something else but i gtg4now so gl
[02:20] <cntb> nothlit: says module does not exist
[02:21] <cntb> ok ty  anyway nothlit
[02:21] <ivan> h
[02:21] <schisms> Just make your linux swap like 1.5 gigs or something.
[02:21] <soundray> shlajfka: I am pretty sure you've got an old version, 5.10, codename Breezy Badger. Don't bother installing it. Get the latest release, 6.10
[02:21] <schisms> How many gigs can your hd hold?
[02:22] <shlajfka> :)
[02:22] <nothlit> cntb, then you need to make sure the restricted modules and headers are installed then reinstall nvidia-glx
[02:22] <shlajfka> soundray: i have a new comp. dont have any OS.. and i need to work:)
[02:22] <shlajfka> Kubuntu
[02:22] <nolimitsoya> schisms, i think we should keep the number of questions down for the moment, to not cause unnescisary stress :)
[02:22] <shlajfka> is tehre a difference
[02:22] <shlajfka> ?
[02:22] <cmt^^> what's the best program for ubuntu to view live streamed video?
[02:22] <schisms> True.
[02:22] <cmt^^> !stream
[02:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about stream - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:23] <ColonelZarkawi> cmt^^, like youtube?
[02:23] <Elendil> Hello, when i try to boot up ubuntu, after it goes through teh loading screen, my screens blacken and say out of sync. Can someone help me on this problem? and also i tryed running in the graphic safe mode.
[02:23] <cmt^^> ColonelZarkawi - no, like live streaming tv-shows
[02:23] <cmt^^> via http
[02:23] <nunod> cmt^^, videolan ?
[02:23] <nolimitsoya> cmt^^, 'sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer mplayer'
[02:23] <schisms> Reconfigure x-server maybe?
[02:23] <ColonelZarkawi> cmt^^, it depends on the format. mozilla-mplayer plugin can handle many
[02:23] <soundray> shlajfka: well, you already have a problem with those CDs which is difficult to solve because it is an old version.
[02:23] <cmt^^> nunod - i have that installed
[02:23] <soundray> shlajfka: so yes, there is a difference
[02:23] <cmt^^> nunod - i want to be sure i can do it, since i'm recording it as well
[02:23] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen: Could you please post the madwifi site url again?
[02:23] <Allz> soundray this is the error that i get when i am booting from linux , Mkdir: connot creat diroctorty '/lib/moudels/2.5.12-10-k7/volatile/' Read Only File System . and when i press on ctrl+d it will restart the computer and the same stuff will show up
[02:23] <shlajfka> maby is Kubuntu
[02:24] <Arwen> question - why does the default media player in Ubuntu suck so bad? I'm not referring to codecs, by the way (this is *not* a troll)
[02:24] <Allz> soundray so how can i fix this , and let this not be read only file system
[02:24] <cmt^^> Elendil - what graphics card do you have?
[02:24] <Elendil> cmt: Nvidia Geforce 7800 GT
[02:24] <cntb> !nvidia
[02:24] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:25] <DARKGuy> Arwen: there are alternatives ^^
[02:25] <cmt^^> Arwen - which player is that?
[02:25] <Arwen> cmt^^, totem
[02:25] <Arwen> DARKGuy, yea... but why is that one default?
[02:25] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, the reason is, ubuntu is gnome user-friendly. gnome pet project for multimedia is gstreamer. gstreamer is slow, bloated and buggy.
[02:25] <soundray> Allz: boot from a live (desktop) CD and run 'sudo e2fsck -y /dev/hda1' (replacing /dev/hda1 with the actual devicename of your root partition)
[02:25] <DARKGuy> Arwen: because it's the most compatible and user-friendly one?
[02:25] <crimsun> Arwen: because it's what's shipped with upstream (GNOME).
[02:25] <cmt^^> Arwen - don't mind the default player, install vlc instead
[02:25] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, that's why totem-gstreamer is an unusable package, full of bugs and with few codecs
[02:25] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, and totem doesn't seem to work... doesn't even resize to match video dimensions
[02:25] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, ah
[02:26] <Arwen> DARKGuy, user-friendly? ^^
[02:26] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, yes, video in the gnome world is just a lot of crap. Try vlc or mplayer instead
[02:26] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, I use vlc
[02:26] <Arwen> just wondering
[02:26] <DARKGuy> Arwen: Well, I think so
[02:26] <Dimensions> soundray ... thanks alot dude ... many thanks ...
[02:26] <cmt^^> Arwen - sudo apt-get install vlc
[02:26] <Arwen> cmt^^, I have it already :-)
[02:26] <soundray> Dimensions: has it worked?
[02:26] <cmt^^> well..
[02:26] <Arwen> VLC 0.8.6 Janus rules
[02:26] <cmt^^> :)
[02:26] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, try mplayer then
[02:26] <econobeing> "Mailcap file /etc/mailcap, line 58: incomplete entry ignored." <--- i get that when i try to open code::blocks, what's it mean?
[02:26] <cmt^^> then use it
[02:26] <Arwen> cmt^^, only downside is that using any media player with beryl causes video not to output...
[02:26] <dabju> For some reason, my wacom works as it should, but gimp nor xinput don't find it, so I don't get pressure sensitivity. What do I do? http://paste.uni.cc/12088
[02:26] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, but never ever, try to make totem-gstreamer work, is a waste of time
[02:27] <soundray> Dimensions: or are you being sarcastic?
[02:27] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, I just get the plugins so screenshots work, lol
[02:27] <rhalff> hi what is the /sys dir in ubuntu ?
[02:27] <Dimensions> yea i am able to boot into ubuntu ... i have added manual entry for Windows as title , root (hd0,0) makeactive and chainloader +1 ... was just wondering abt root if thats the rite one for mine ?
[02:27] <rhalff> me only knows /proc and /dev
[02:27] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, I think the GUI is what's screwing me up though
[02:27] <ColonelZarkawi> haha gstreamer is such a joke
[02:28] <Dimensions> lol nah i aint being sarcastic it was really a help as i have imp data in my hdd ..
[02:28] <Elendil> is the default Ubuntu running Edgy?
[02:28] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, yep... what does kubuntu use as its multimedia player?
[02:28] <Arwen> Elendil, ? BTW - elves suck
[02:28] <cmt^^> heh
[02:28] <crimsun> GSt is by no means "a joke".
[02:28] <Elendil> lol
[02:28] <Arwen> crimsun, that itself was a joke
[02:28] <ColonelZarkawi> crimsun, is unusable for many many ubuntu users
[02:28] <Elendil> Elendil is a gondorian
[02:28] <cmt^^> Elendil - Ubuntu 6.10 IS edgy
[02:28] <soundray> Dimensions: no, if Windows is on your /dev/hda3, that root line should read 'root (hd0,2)'
[02:28] <cmt^^> not sure what you mean
[02:28] <cmt^^> :)
[02:28] <Elendil> kk
[02:28] <Elendil> thx
[02:28] <crimsun> ColonelZarkawi: meaning totem-gstreamer or GSt itself?
[02:29] <soundray> Dimensions: (grub starts counting at 0, so it's always the number from the devicename minus one)
[02:29] <Arwen> Elendil, try "/me" - also, Elendil is an elf, no?
[02:29] <Elendil> cmd: so to get this sync problem to go away, i have to install the nvidia driver on command line?
[02:29] <ColonelZarkawi> crimsun, the amount of users that come to this channel or post to newsgroups or forums with experiences how totem-gstreamer DOES NOT WORK, proves that
[02:29] <Elendil> no
[02:29] <Elendil> Gondorian*
[02:29] <crimsun> ColonelZarkawi: you're referring to totem-gstreamer, then, -not- GSt.
[02:30] <Allz> soundray when you say boot from live (desktop) cd , do you mean the cd i used to install linux?
[02:30] <cmt^^> How should I go about capturing a .rm-stream?
[02:30] <Arwen> Elendil, I coulda sworn Elendil was that guy from the havens that sailed that one boat
[02:30] <soundray> Allz: I don't know, because I have no idea how you installed it.
[02:30] <echosystm> whats the main difference between KDE and gnome? is one typically faster than the other?
[02:30] <Arwen> crimsun, the GSt plugin is pretty bad too
[02:30] <Arwen> framework*
[02:30] <cmt^^> echosystm - pretty much a question of personal taste and preferences
[02:31] <soundray> Allz: if it's edgy, and the install was graphical rather than textmode, then yes
[02:31] <echosystm> right
[02:31] <ColonelZarkawi> well for what is good gstreamer if not to play movies? I know gstreamer tries to be a generic framework for multimedia but that doesn't matter to the users
[02:31] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen: Are you there?
[02:31] <echosystm> but gnome is more well supported/widespread right?
[02:31] <ColonelZarkawi> what matters is that when playing movies with that framework, the framework does not work
[02:31] <cmt^^> well gnome is default DE for ubuntu
[02:31] <echosystm> because of the development side of things
[02:31] <cmt^^> I don't know why really
[02:31] <Spaghetti_Knife> Allen: Could you help me with my network card installation?
[02:31] <echosystm> rightyo
[02:31] <Arwen> cmt^^, mm, KDE should be... so much easier to configure
[02:31] <cmt^^> Arwen - I don't agreee
[02:31] <cmt^^> -e
[02:32] <cmt^^> it's bound to happend
[02:32] <Elendil> So can anyone help me with this monitor sync problem?
[02:32] <cmt^^> with so many dists
[02:32] <cmt^^> and so many options at hand
[02:32] <Elendil> i cant access anything xcept command line
[02:32] <LjL> !enter | cmt^^
[02:32] <ubotu> cmt^^: Please don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying (in other words <Enter> please <Enter> don't <Enter> type like this)
[02:32] <Spaghetti_Knife> What media player resembles Winamp?
[02:32] <Elendil> in the beginning
[02:32] <Arwen> cmt^^, that itself is a problem.... qt + gtk is bad enough
[02:32] <LjL> Spaghetti_Knife: xmms
[02:32] <soundray> Spaghetti_Knife: beep-media-player
[02:32] <Arwen> Spaghetti_Knife, foobar, but that's for windows
[02:33] <Pelo> Spaghetti_Knife,  but try the others too, you'll be pleasantly surprised
[02:33] <Elendil> ??
[02:33] <cmt^^> Sorry LjL, I'm gonna try and control my enter-key better
[02:33] <Dimensions> soundray lol i got it change but why doesn't it show any options it just loads grub and then goes into windows ...
[02:33] <ColonelZarkawi> !lol
[02:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lol - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:33] <schisms> spaghetti_knife
[02:33] <Arwen> lol
[02:33] <schisms> http://www.xmms.org/
[02:33] <ColonelZarkawi> xmms is old
[02:33] <ColonelZarkawi> beep-media-player is better
[02:33] <Spaghetti_Knife> schisms Yeah?
[02:33] <Allz> soundray i just booted from the cd and i see this text -> to install only the base system type "server" to install the default system type enter , and i get prompt -> like this Boot:
[02:34] <schisms> Really?
[02:34] <schisms> I liked xmms though
[02:34] <Dimensions> grr... escape worked ... how to increase it now ... lemme see ...
[02:34] <schisms> Lemme try it
[02:34] <cmt^^> Well Arwen, the problem is also an asset I think, giving you options and possibilities to pick the dist/de that suits your needs best
[02:34] <crimsun> Arwen: that's an interesting opinion (I happen to disagree, but whatever)
[02:34] <Arwen> cmt^^, it also means that most people have to have all the frameworks insatlled
[02:34] <cmt^^> In my eyes it's not really a "problem"
[02:34] <schisms> spaghetti_knife, try xmms
[02:34] <Arwen> I've seen too many apps that require some random framework
[02:35] <schisms> It really resembles winamp
[02:35] <Arwen> which incidentally is what .NET is supposed to fix
[02:35] <soundray> Dimensions: you may have to change the line that says 'default 0' or similar in menu.lst, or place the Windows section at the end of that file.
[02:35] <soundray> Allz: you have the Alternate CD then, not the desktop. I don't know if you can use this one to run e2fsck. Maybe LjL does... hello LjL?
[02:36] <Arwen> now for my problem - when I use any media player with beryl, the video doesn't show, only a black rectangle - what's up?
[02:36] <cmt^^> So, does anyone have any idea as to how to capture a live streaming .rm?
[02:36] <schisms> Beryl has its bugs.
[02:36] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I compile it? Please don't point me to the Ubuntu wiki. I can't read it.
[02:36] <Dimensions> soundray on my other system i had just replaced my windows to top for default boot but how do i increase time interval for befor it boots it ... i am on boot screen
[02:36] <Arwen> cmt^^, vlc --output=foo.bar
[02:36] <Arwen> *not* a real command
[02:36] <schisms> I believe there's several threads in the forums relating to that problem
[02:36] <schisms> One sec
[02:37] <Arwen> schisms, yea - that bug plagued old versions of vista too
[02:37] <Spaghetti_Knife> schisms How do I compile it? Please don't point me to the wiki. I don't understand it.
[02:37] <karl> but proftpd won't even start
[02:37] <Arwen> schisms, the Video Overlay + Buffer issue
[02:37] <schisms> one sec
[02:37] <cmt^^> Any ideas?
[02:37] <ColonelZarkawi> what is vista?
[02:37] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, new version of windows
[02:37] <schisms> I'd go with beep
[02:37] <ColonelZarkawi> oh!
[02:37] <schisms> lemme see
[02:37] <karl> it just says, cannot start neither in standalone nor in inetd/xinetd mode. Check your configuration
[02:37] <eobanb> what's the path to upstart in 6.10?
[02:37] <graphyx> I am trying to find and add a universe that includes perlmagick module.
[02:37] <craigbass1976> How do I make ubuntu ask for the root password rather than the user when I click on something like printer config?
[02:37] <ColonelZarkawi> a new version? after 10 years?
[02:37] <graphyx> anyone have a good way to identify which one has it?
[02:37] <karl> is there somethign obvious I'm missing?
[02:38] <air0day> i'm trying to build xglsnow (http://cornergraf.net/projects/xglsnow/) but i'm being given errors when i do "make"
[02:38] <schisms> I'd go with xmms
[02:38] <jugUT> hello
[02:38] <schisms> it's only 2 megabytes
[02:38] <Arwen> graphyx, um.. just add the universe repository
[02:38] <schisms> sudo apt-get install xmms
[02:38] <graphyx> ok
[02:38] <schisms> Make sure you have the codecs
[02:38] <ColonelZarkawi> no xmms is old
[02:38] <cmt^^> What's wrong with rhythmbox?
[02:38] <air0day> -e compiling : snow.c -> build/libsnow.loPackage x11 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
[02:38] <ColonelZarkawi> xmms is old and unmaintained
[02:38] <soundray> Allz: maybe just try. If you boot it past the keyboard config, and then hit 'Alt-F2' you should get to a screen where it says 'Hit enter to activate console'
[02:38] <schisms> That's my question too
[02:38] <cmt^^> Similar to iTunes, with a lot of nifty functions...
[02:38] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, that attitude shows a bias - there's been plenty of releases of windows in the past years
[02:38] <ColonelZarkawi> use beep-media-player for a similar player instead
[02:38] <jugUT> what packages are required to write and manipulate programs in python?
[02:39] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, really? sorry dude I don't know much about windoze
[02:39] <soundray> Allz: hit enter there and run 'e2fsck /dev/hda1' (again replacing hda1 appropriately)
[02:39] <Elendil> Hello, when i try to boot up ubuntu, after it goes through teh loading screen, my screens blacken and say out of sync. Can someone help me on this problem? and also i tryed running in the graphic safe mode.
[02:39] <DARKGuy> XMMS is the best, lightweight and such
[02:39] <DARKGuy> I love it
[02:39] <DARKGuy> :)
[02:39] <Arwen> cmt^^, I don't like rythmbox... too much gstreamer in it
[02:39] <schisms> It is lightweight
[02:39] <ColonelZarkawi> xmms is old and uses gtk1
[02:39] <webmaren> i need help setting up dvd playback on edgy
[02:39] <DARKGuy> it's fast, and WinAmp-like
[02:39] <ColonelZarkawi> beep-media-player is new and uses gtk2 looks nicer
[02:39] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, there just haven't been many major releases :-P
[02:39] <DARKGuy> not too bloated with big interface stuff
[02:39] <air0day> how do i add stuff to that path?
[02:39] <cmt^^> DARKGuy - that's exactly why I don't like it
[02:39] <schisms> Check the wiki on restricted formats
[02:39] <Dimensions> thanks alottt .... soundray for all your help and patience ....
[02:39] <soundray> Allz: this is my recollection of how the Debian installer works, so this may not be up-to-date info. See how it goes.
[02:39] <jugUT> is beep light like xmms?
[02:39] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, what's the real diff between GTKs 1.2 and 2.x?
[02:39] <cmt^^> winamp-like... -shrug-
[02:39] <soundray> Dimensions: yw
[02:39] <Dimensions> :)
[02:40] <craigbass1976> How do I make ubuntu ask for the root password rather than the user's when I click on something like printer config?
[02:40] <DARKGuy> Well I think this XMMS-is-good-or-bad convo can be taken to #ubuntu-offtopic, sure?
[02:40] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, the main difference (from the user point of view) is the look-and-feel
[02:40] <craigbass1976> Or even when I do a sudo command in the command line
=== Lord_Skummel is now known as xaco
[02:40] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, gtk2 applications look much nicer
[02:40] <cmt^^> Hey DARKGuy - 1998 called, they want their mp3-players back
[02:40] <air0day> anyone?
[02:40] <Elendil> Hello, when i try to boot up ubuntu, after it goes through teh loading screen, my screens blacken and say out of sync. Can someone help me on this problem? and also i tryed running in the graphic safe mode.
[02:40] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, hrmm
[02:40] <DARKGuy> cmt^^: oO?
[02:40] <Arwen> Elendil, use the alternate cd
[02:40] <cmt^^> :)
[02:40] <jugUT> airday there is a file you add it too, let me check on it
[02:41] <schisms> Elendil, what graphic card do you use?
[02:41] <Elendil> Arwen = Why?
[02:41] <Elendil> Sch - Geforce 7800 GT
[02:41] <air0day> it says i need x11.pc and beryl.pc on my path
[02:41] <cmt^^> So, noone has any idea on how to capture live streams in ubuntu?
[02:41] <air0day> but i run beryl
[02:41] <air0day> so i dunno what it's talking about
[02:41] <Arwen> Elendil, alternate pwns live
[02:41] <Arwen> for installing anyway
[02:41] <Arwen> cmt^^, you need to use a proper media player
[02:41] <cmt^^> Arwen - such as?
[02:41] <Arwen> cmt^^, VLC for one can save streams to files
[02:41] <cmt^^> Will VLC do?
[02:41] <Arwen> MPlayer has that function too I think
[02:41] <cmt^^> Oh sweet. How do I go about it?
[02:41] <schisms> I've been wondering that myself cmt^^
[02:41] <Spaghetti_Knife> Has anybody installed madwifi? Can anybody walk me through the process of making it work with my card?
[02:41] <Spaghetti_Knife> I've already installed madwifi, and I've typed in athos_pci, so what else should i do?
[02:42] <Arwen> cmt^^, open netstream > advanced > output > filename
[02:42] <schisms> Package manager cmt^^
[02:42] <Arwen> there's a command line too, but I don't know it

[02:44] <craigbass1976> How do I make ubuntu ask for the root password rather than the user's when I click on something like printer config?  Or even when I do a sudo command in the command line.
[02:44] <soundray> Elendil: only if you are planning to run numbercrunching apps. If not, pick the i386 one
[02:44] <jugUT> schisms, I do to.. I have a Dell
[02:44] <Arwen> !sudo craigbass1976
[02:44] <soundray> Allz: please go back to my question and read it carefully

[02:45] <jugUT> oh yeah
[02:45] <ColonelZarkawi> I use HP
[02:45] <Arwen> craigbass1976, basically you have to sudo passwd root and then visudo
[02:45] <cmt^^> Arwen - it won't work :<
[02:45] <j_`> how do i remap my altgr key to behave like alt
[02:45] <j_`> ?
[02:45] <ColonelZarkawi> HP notebook very good
[02:45] <schisms> ValMarko, the debate is endless
[02:45] <Arwen> cmt^^, what's the error?
[02:45] <Spaghetti_Knife> Could somebody help me with installing my wireless card?
[02:45] <jugUT> it does what I need it to do; I like it
[02:45] <schisms> I prefer gnome, personally.
[02:45] <Allz> soundray no it does not ask me what kinda of kayboard i have
[02:45] <cmt^^> well it doesn't show anything
[02:45] <cmt^^> :)
[02:45] <Arwen> schisms, not really... the only thing I find holding back KDE is Qt
[02:45] <jugUT> I'm getting into fluxbox
[02:45] <ValMarko> I dont think soo
[02:45] <cmt^^> or save anything, for that matter
[02:45] <Spaghetti_Knife> Somebody, please?
[02:45] <schisms> I wish I could help
[02:45] <LjL> schisms, ValMarko: more importantly, that debate is offtopic
[02:45] <cptCaverna> schisms: any problem with ubuntu on notebook ??
[02:45] <schisms> None at all
[02:45] <craigbass1976> Arwen, so /etc/sudoers IS the file I'm loking to edit?  Ok, that's where I looked first but saw nothing that struck me as the solution.
[02:45] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, sorry I'm not familiar with madwifi
[02:45] <soundray> Allz: what does it ask?
[02:45] <Arwen> cmt^^, err... do you have your uri right? to save, you have to check "local output"
[02:45] <ValMarko> You are right
[02:45] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anyone know how to use madwifi?
[02:46] <schisms> What notebook do you have?
[02:46] <Arwen> craigbass1976, you have to tack rootpw somewhere
[02:46] <cmt^^> Arwen - I did
[02:46] <schisms> And what's the issue?
[02:46] <cptCaverna> schisms: compaq
[02:46] <FuZzYHALL> cptCaverna: I have
[02:46] <schisms> Specs?
[02:46] <craigbass1976> Arwen, what do you mean?  I gave root a password
[02:46] <Arwen> cmt^^, is it a valid format for realplayer?
[02:46] <cmt^^> dunno, .rm
[02:46] <FuZzYHALL> cptCaverna: Suspend mode isn't working good
[02:46] <Arwen> craigbass1976, rootpw is a parameter - you did passwd root?
[02:46] <graphyx> I am unable to install perlmagick after having added the warty universe.
[02:46] <graphyx> Anyone else have this issue?
[02:46] <Arwen> cmt^^, not all realmedia works
[02:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anybody know how to use madwifi?
[02:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> Or how to install a wireless card?
[02:46] <Allz> soundray it just ask me about , do you want to install the full package or the base
[02:47] <craigbass1976> Arwen, I did sudo passwd
[02:47] <soundray> graphyx: warty? Are you sure?
[02:47] <graphyx> I found that bug posting, but I either don't understand it or I am still missing something.
[02:47] <Arwen> craigbass1976, on the line with "Defaults" on it, add !rootpw at the end
[02:47] <cptCaverna> ok, thanks all. I will try.
[02:47] <Spaghetti_Knife> Please?
[02:47] <graphyx> soundray: warty-security universe
[02:47] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, what wireles card do you have?
[02:47] <Spaghetti_Knife> Help?

[02:49] <soundray> Allz: hit enter or whatever to make it boot. Then tell me what it asks.
[02:49] <schisms> I think updating is in order.
[02:49] <graphyx> eobanb: I don't have to use warty.  In fact I got rid of it.
[02:49] <Elendil> So, i have a AMD Athlon 64 3200+, i should dl the 64-bit PC (AMD64) alternate install CD

[02:49] <graphyx> eobanb: It was just a posting that solved this particular issue before.
[02:49] <graphyx> eobanb: But it didn't work for me.
[02:49] <soundray> Elendil: are you ignoring my reply?
[02:49] <eobanb> graphyx, well using warty packages with a newer version of ubuntu might not work
[02:50] <Allz> soundray if i hit enter it will install linux from the bigining

[02:50] <graphyx> eobanb: But I still need to find a universe that has the perlmagick in it.  Any ideas?
[02:50] <soundray> Allz: if you want to get past this problem, I need you to have that little bit of trust and boot the CD.
[02:51] <ColonelZarkawi> Rprp, do you have ubuntu 64bit?
[02:51] <Allz> Soundray it say if you hit enter you will install the default system

[02:51] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, what is not working?  did you try "iwconfig" in the console and see if it lists anything?
[02:51] <graphyx> sweet thanks.
[02:51] <Allz> Soundray but if i write server and hit enter it will install the base system
[02:51] <eobanb> it's in edgy universe

[02:51] <soundray> Allz: if you don't hit enter RIGHT NOW, I will leave you to talk to someone else.
[02:51] <echosystm> im considering installing that instead
[02:51] <ColonelZarkawi> Rprp, JAVA PLUGIN will work only in ubuntu 32bit
[02:51] <Arwen> also less functional
[02:51] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT What should I do? I downloaded and installed madwifi,and I have my card in the slot right now.
[02:52] <ColonelZarkawi> Rprp, FLASH PLUGIN will work only in ubuntu 32bit
[02:52] <Allz> soundray okei i hit it
[02:52] <echosystm> functionality isnt a big issue, i rarely use X
[02:52] <schisms> I've never heard good things about xtce.

[02:52] <Rprp> ColonelZarkawi: i dunno what version i have :P
[02:52] <Elendil> ...
[02:52] <Rprp> how can i check it?
[02:52] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT It lists only ath0 as having wireless extensions.
[02:52] <echosystm> i'm not all that knowledgeable about the desktop environment vs. window manager deal
[02:52] <soundray> Allz: what exactly is it doing right now?
[02:52] <echosystm> can someone summarise exactly what i lose?
[02:53] <ColonelZarkawi> Rprp, what does

Package perlmagick is not available, but is referred to by another package.This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or  is only available from another source  E: Package perlmagick has no installation candidate"
[02:54] <eobanb> echosystm, metacity, beryl, etc are window managers.  gnome, kde, etc, are DEs

[03:03] <schisms> Ah

[03:04] <Rprp> so i need gxine?
[03:04] <Arwen> schisms, I have flash - but I doubt the wisdom of it

[03:05] <Allz> soundray i tryied it agein ang agein to be sure
[03:05] <schisms> I'm positive it will work
[03:05] <Arwen> schisms, nope - I'm on dialup... rather diagnose the problem
[03:05] <soundray> Allz: why does it take you so long to respond?
[03:05] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT?
[03:05] <schisms> Ah
[03:06] <schisms> But if all else fails.

[03:06] <craigbass1976> Arwen, yes
[03:06] <craigbass1976> Arwen, I just installed jackd with my pass
[03:06] <Trixsey> I'm on an SSH connection to school, trying to run firefox.. you guys know why it doesn't work?

[03:06] <Arwen> craigbass1976, hmm.... run sudo from the command line and see if you can enter ro0t's password
[03:07] <Rprp> I installed gxine got Shockwave Flash 9.0 d78 and Java(TM) Plug-in 1.5.0_06 So, whats wrong?
[03:07] <Acill> I get an error from the Open firmware prompt after its done telling me filesystem not supported
[03:07] <schisms> gxine is very light too.
[03:07] <betel> I need to install Kubuntu onto a just formated ext3 partition. How would I do this without the graphical installer?
[03:07] <Arwen> craigbass1976, why would you ever want rootpw anyway?
[03:07] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT?
[03:07] <soundray> Allz: I'm sorry, I've run out of time. The only thing I can suggest is that you recheck whether you've entered the command as I've given it to you.
[03:07] <Elendil> Ok, i have a 7800 GT Graphix card, im getting out of sync errors on start up on ubuntu, need help fixing sync problem
[03:07] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, did you configure the connection?
[03:07] <schisms> try command line
[03:07] <Acill> but ext3 has never been an issue with any of the other Ubuntu builds
[03:07] <craigbass1976> Arwen, it would ease my transition from Fedora.
[03:07] <schisms> and just log in as root there
[03:07] <ColonelZarkawi> Rprp, youtube doesn't work for you?
[03:07] <soundray> Allz: if it still doesn't work, download and burn the Desktop CD and try the same thing, but with 'sudo' at the beginning of that line.
[03:07] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT How do I do that? I went to System>Administration>Networking, but I don't know what to do from there.
[03:07] <Rprp> Youtube works
[03:08] <craigbass1976> Arwen, I did sudo apt-get install jackd, and type my pass in when it asked.  Everything went
[03:08] <Blind-Virus> from my above question i went to the site and can not seem to get that to work. now it is alredy mounted as i can read it and there is an icon on the desktop but i can not write to it any ideas??
[03:08] <Rprp> but
[03:08] <Rprp> http://mafiaway.nl/huntelaar.php <-- thats not working.
[03:08] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, does ath0 show up there?  is the enable connection box checked?
[03:08] <DARKGuy> the desktop install should have a mode where it just becomes command line, for people with video problems
[03:08] <Rprp> How can i fix that lame probleM!/
[03:08] <soundray> Allz: and, one more thing: if you have a problem, ask the channel. Don't ask for specific people and *never* msg anyone unless invited.
[03:08] <Spaghetti_Knife> It shows "Wireless connection," "essid: PAN," and Address: "DHCP."
[03:09] <Spaghetti_Knife> The enable connection box is checked.
[03:09] <jugUT> is there an edit button?
[03:09] <finchx6> was wondering if someone with a lot of patience could possibly help me out with XGL and Beryl, or Compiz.  I'm a newbie, but I've got a decent overall grasp on linux, or so I thought until I tried getting XGL to work.  I can get my sound, 3D accelerator, and everything else to work no problems... just can't figure this XGL thing out
[03:09] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT What's screwed up?
[03:09] <Blind-Virus> spaghetti_knife: i also had problems with wep encrytion but i founda program in the add remove part of ubuntu called wireless assistent try that it worked for me
[03:09] <soundray> Allz: sticking to etiquette will help you get help.
[03:09] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, is there a configure button?
[03:10] <soundray> Bye!
[03:10] <Rprp> I think i missed the codecs for .wmv files, how can i installed it and what do i need?
[03:10] <Blind-Virus> any one know anything about writting to ntfs??
[03:10] <Spaghetti_Knife> There's a "Properties" button.
[03:10] <craigbass1976> Blind-Virus, only via samba
[03:10] <jugUT> does it have a place to put your password in?
[03:10] <Blind-Virus> craidbass1967: where do i obtain this samba?
[03:10] <Blind-Virus> can i do it thru the terminal?
[03:10] <Rprp> I think i missed the codecs for .wmv files, how can i installed it and what do i need?
[03:11] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT It doesn't seem to do anything, though.
[03:11] <Rprp> ColonelZarkawi: ? :P
[03:11] <Arwen> schisms, seems to depend on the graphics card...
[03:11] <craigbass1976> Blind-Virus, It will only work over a network.  You're probably trying to write to an ntfs partition on your ubuntu drive, right?
[03:11] <Arwen> schisms, what model do you have?
[03:11] <schisms> Intel Graphics media accelerator 950I I believe
[03:11] <Blind-Virus> craigbass1967: yes it is all one ahrd drive with three partitions 1 is linux two is swap and three is windows

[03:12] <Rprp> I think i missed the codecs for .wmv files, how can i installed it and what do i need?
[03:12] <Blind-Virus> czambran81: put in the cd make shure boot from cd is enabled in your bios and run from the disk
[03:13] <schisms> Arwen, what's your's?
[03:13] <czambran81> Blind-Virus and craigbass1976: Hi. In order to at least get to the install I have to add the option noacpi, but this make the installer not detect my hard drive
[03:13] <Arwen> schisms, ATI X300
[03:13] <Arwen> I know it sucks
[03:13] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT How is the assistant going to help with encryption?
[03:13] <schisms> I'm telling you, gxine is the answer.
[03:13] <betel> To install, could I just cp teh whole CD to my new ext3, or is there a nice script that I could run? The graphics installer freezes.
[03:13] <finchx6> Rprp: Try downloading Automatix 2 or Easy Ubuntu for something like wmv codecs
[03:13] <Blind-Virus> czambran81: are you saying when you downloaded the .iso file and burnt the imige to disk and put it in it will not run form the cd??
[03:13] <schisms> You could install via text mode
[03:14] <craigbass1976> czambran81, can you disable it in the motherboard instead?
[03:14] <LjL> !automatix | finchx6, Rprp
[03:14] <ubotu> finchx6, Rprp: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[03:14] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Rprp about wmv | Rprp, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:14] <Rprp> automatix can break my system
[03:14] <Rprp> :x

[03:14] <schisms> I don't think there's much more you can do.
[03:14] <schisms> Totem is just terrible.
[03:14] <czambran81> craigbass1976: how do I do that?
[03:15] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT How do I configure it?
[03:15] <Blind-Virus> spaghetti_knife: have you tried the wireless assitent
[03:15] <czambran81> Blind-Virus: that is not what I mean
[03:15] <Blind-Virus> digital: you know anything about writing to ntfs filesystems?
[03:15] <craigbass1976> Watch when you reboot.  You hit F1 or Del to enter setup, and shut it off there.  Wait a minute, acpi is the power management, right?
[03:15] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, be more specific.  Are you talking about your wireless adapter or the wireless router
[03:15] <schisms> If I were you I'd wreck my connection for a while for gxine
[03:15] <czambran81> craigbass1976: yes
[03:16] <sorroww> how do i mount my other hard drives?
[03:16] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT I'm talking about my wireless adapter.

[03:16] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, what kind of encryption does your wireless router have?
[03:16] <craigbass1976> czambran81, then yeah, try it there.  You'll have to hunt around, as every motherboard is different.
[03:16] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUt and Blind-Virus: the assistant keeps telling me that the connection failed.
[03:16] <Blind-Virus> czambran81 how do i know witch version of linux i have?
[03:16] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUt and Blind-Virus: The computer that the router's connected to is running Windows.

[03:18] <czambran81> craigbass1976: I actually haven't
[03:18] <craigbass1976> czambran81, oh, then try it.

[03:18] <sorroww> my other hd is ntfs
[03:18] <Blind-Virus> digital: 6.06
[03:19] <d1gital> thats dapper

[03:20] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUt and Blind-Virus It's WEP.
[03:20] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUt and Blind-Virus Does that change anything?
[03:21] <HymnToLife> czambran81, what exactly is the problem with it ?
[03:21] <skyrunner> having problem with beryl manager, when i put select window manager if i try selecting beryl nothing happens but if i select metacity it actually does select it
[03:22] <finchx6> LjL: oh, ok...  they basically just make it easier... although, like I was told here and I've read other places, they can be unstable.  Basically, it works more similar to a windows installation.  It opens asking you which components and codecs, etc you'd like installed, then after you select them, it goes through doing all of the APT through the terminal and setting things up for you afterward
[03:22] <sorroww> so theres no way to mount my other hard drives?
[03:22] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUt and Blind-Virus What do I do if it's wep?
[03:22] <Arwen> schisms, yea - I can use either X11 (slow) or OpenGL (buggy) and it works
[03:22] <czambran81> HymnToLife: Unless I add the noacpi option to the ubuntu installer, and get my screen full of the following error mesage: Unknown interrupt or fault at EIP. But when I add the noacpi option to the install, my HD doesn;t get detected
[03:22] <Menisk> how do i upgrade from ubuntu 5.10 to ubuntu 6.06 using the cd
[03:22] <schisms> To be honest, I'm pretty much a noob.
[03:23] <schisms> So I do not really know what those are.
[03:23] <alexander> Does anybody here know anything about the program LMMS?
[03:23] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUt and Blind-Virus Help?
[03:23] <LjL> finchx6: i'm afraid Automatix goes through things that are much more black magic than plain APT (which is possibly the reason why it breaks so often). and i'm not sure how that's more like Windows... Synaptic does exactly the same thing: ask you what you want installed, you select the stuff, and then it installs it ;)
[03:24] <skyrunner> guys im having problem with beryl manager, when i put select window manager if i try selecting beryl nothing happens but if i select metacity it actually does select it
[03:24] <Pie-rate> is there a command i can use that'll generate a keypress?
[03:24] <Spaghetti_Knife> jugUT It's WEP.
[03:24] <schisms> Ah, I see.
[03:24] <schisms> Me, I use X11.
[03:24] <czambran81> HymnToLife: any ideas?
[03:24] <Menisk> !upgrade
[03:24] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:24] <LjL> finchx6: for codecs, getting w32codecs from the seveas repository should mostly do the trick (although for some wmv you don't even need that, and following the standard howto works)
[03:24] <akk> On Edgy, I have kacpi_notify taking over my machine and I have to pull the power plug. Anyone know anything about how to shut off kacpi?

[03:25] <shwag> How do I get my Xorg to run one of the "Supported Future Video Modes"
[03:25] <czambran81> HymnToLife: I am already downloading OpenSUSE, but I was hoping I could get Ubuntu on it
[03:25] <craigbass1976> czambran81, you could try edgy...
[03:26] <czambran81> craigbass1976: I did, and I have the same problems
[03:26] <ivx> hey if i have two computer running ubuntu, connected to a linksys router, how can i see the hd in the one to copy files back and forth
[03:26] <econobeing> anybody know how i can get this wine shortcut to work?
[03:26] <econobeing> for photoshop
[03:26] <finchx6> LjL: I compared it to windows because you don't manually go through the terminal, if that makes any sense.  Personally, I've only used automatix once, on my last install, which I ended up screwing up like the 10 before that, but all I use automatix OR easy ubuntu for is just like mp3 and whatnot abilities
[03:26] <czambran81> craigbass1976: I actually had to downgrade my laptop from edgy to ubuntu because of how unstable it became
[03:26] <craigbass1976> czambran81, Ahh.  CentOS?  I would steer clear of Suse jsut because of the MS deal
[03:26] <schisms> wine and photoshop
[03:26] <czambran81> craigbass1976: GOod point. THank you
[03:26] <schisms> That seems to be a bad mix.
[03:26] <czambran81> craigbass1976: I will download centos then
[03:26] <Spaghetti_Knife> ugUT You still there? It's WEP.
[03:27] <sorroww> how do update to 6.06 without a cd?
[03:27] <schisms> I'd use gimp if I were you.
[03:27] <sc0tt> sorroww: got internet connection?
[03:27] <econobeing> i can get it to startup if i type the commands in the terminal, but when i try to make a shortcut, no dice
[03:27] <schisms> sorroww, upgrade to edgy eft
[03:27] <craigbass1976> czambran81, not that suse will be any worse, I just don't trust the bahstahds at Novell now
[03:27] <sorroww> i heard upgrading to that from breezy broke stuff
[03:27] <czambran81> craigbass1976: neither do it, but on my desperation I forgot about it
[03:27] <schisms> Any non cd upgrade is a nightmare.
[03:27] <LjL> finchx6: well, actually i don't think you *have* to go through the terminal to install things from Seveas' repository (and you certainly don't for installing most of the stuff that's mentioned in the howto). i don't have Synaptic, so i'm not sure how exactly it would be done, but i'm quite sure you can add repositories from there without touching the CLI
[03:28] <alexander> I need help -- when trying to configure LMMS it gives me "error: ***QTDIR must be defined, or --with-qtdir option given"
[03:28] <jugUT> Spaghetti_Knife, brb
[03:28] <schisms> I recommend backing everything up and simply installing 6.10
[03:28] <sorroww> id have to get the cd
[03:28] <sorroww> im out of blanks
[03:28] <finchx6> And if you're interested as to why I've screwed so many installs of it up, its because I can NOT get XGL and compiz to work

[03:29] <Hirvinen> sorroww: Search the Ubuntu Wiki for upgrade instructions.

[03:47] <h08817> Arwen, i don't have internet
[03:47] <h08817> Arwen, i have a wireless netgear usb
[03:47] <Arwen> h08817, err... you're kinda outta luck - download the alt install CD and add it to your apt sources
[03:47] <Arwen> then run that command
[03:47] <Arwen> h08817, btw, use ethernet, it's ages ahead of wifi
[03:48] <bayzider> please =) ?
[03:48] <Piet> hehe, nice one. http://ln-s.net/GTn
[03:48] <HymnToLife> Arwen, alternate CD in Hoary, hmm ?
[03:48] <h08817> Arwen, o yes and im going to do that in like 2 seconds?
[03:48] <hanasaki> anyone know why the shift key wont work.. but jsut for the ` and tilda above it?
[03:48] <Arwen> h08817, there's no fast way
[03:48] <Arwen> h08817, I'm on dialup, I'd know
[03:48] <h08817> so whats the plan
[03:48] <h08817> what do i need to do?
[03:48] <Arwen> so please don't give me that shit (no offense to ops)
[03:48] <h08817> the main thing is i need a bigger hd but.....
[03:49] <Arwen> h08817, you either need to leech someone's internet and download it or order a dapper CD from shipit
[03:49] <finchx6> i heard soon they were going to be adding edgy to shipit as well
[03:49] <nextstate> anybody having trouble getting linux 2.6.19 to boot? I'm wondering if has to do with the new sata drivers.
[03:49] <Arwen> finchx6, that's a lie
[03:49] <LjL> finchx6: doubt it
[03:49] <DBO> Arwen, none taken but saying ops does ping me, I dont care that much but if you dont mind =)  Anyhow good work in here =)
[03:49] <HymnToLife> Arwen, you n00b, I downloaded my 14 Sarge CDs on dialup :p
[03:50] <Arwen> HymnToLife, lol
[03:50] <h08817> Arwen, whats dapper going to do for me?
[03:50] <Arwen> HymnToLife, pssh - I warezed (no offense) the Star Wars trilogy on dialup (in lossless too!)
[03:50] <Arwen> h08817, nothing, its just that you can't order older ones
[03:51] <finchx6> really???  It was in a forum, so of course I had to quote the idiot that didn't know what he's talking about, but...  possibly when they release the next version it will get moved down to shipit
[03:51] <finchx6> lol
[03:51] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I install Flash?
[03:51] <h08817> Arwen, true

[03:51] <h08817> i did install the full version of hoary on my larger hd with windows and i got the grub 17 error so that put me to a half
[03:51] <Arwen> finchx6, dapper won't get unshipped til its update cycle is over
[03:51] <cmweb> Is any one familiar with ppp?
[03:51] <HymnToLife> btw h08817 did you try Etch as I recommended you ?
[03:51] <Arwen> h08817, half what?
[03:51] <DBO> Arigato, btw, I have seen Edgy shipit CD's at UDS, dont know if they are going to make it to shipit or not though, but at the least they have SOME CD's and covers slips to go with
[03:52] <finchx6> ah... so thats how they decide on it
[03:52] <h08817> arwen
[03:52] <Arwen> h08817, you might want a different version of linux though
[03:52] <h08817> Arwen, wrong spelling i meant to say it put me to a halt
[03:52] <LjL> !anyone | cmweb
[03:52] <ubotu> cmweb: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:52] <cmweb> I want to make a dialup link placed on my desktop so i can easly dialup
[03:52] <Arwen> h08817, ah
[03:52] <motin> please help my keyboard is not working this is critical
[03:52] <Arwen> h08817, how much disk space do you have?
[03:52] <cmweb> ljl, you were dieing to do that wernt you?
[03:53] <h08817> HymnToLife, i checked it out but it didn't work
[03:53] <LjL> cmweb: not really, i'm just amused by the fact that you never seem to learn anything.
[03:53] <h08817> arwen
[03:53] <Arwen> cmweb, sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp or kppp
[03:53] <h08817> Arwen, i only have 1.3GB
[03:53] <Arwen> !enter > h08817
[03:53] <motin> this        iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiss   i rrrrrrrrrrrr tttttttttttating plllllesaa hhhhhelp'
[03:53] <Arwen> h08817, err.... try something like gentoo
[03:53] <Arwen> h08817, ubuntu is not for you
[03:53] <Arwen> motin irtating?
[03:54] <motin> iiiii can     ooooonnnlly
[03:54] <h08817> Arwen, well im new
[03:54] <LjL> motin: a second, i'll find you the relevant bug report
[03:54] <finchx6> Just out of curiousity, if anyone could help me out with what I actually came in here about...  the whole XGL, or AIGLX problems.  All the tutorials and how-to's I attempt, result in me having to format and reinstall ubuntu.  Is there any easier way of installing this rather than the typical walk-throughs of it??
[03:54] <cmweb> arwen, i cant use kppp, it wants a login script and i dont know the commands for my dialup server. Isnt gnome-ppp the one already installed? I want to place a shortcut to dialup on the desktop
[03:54] <HymnToLife> h08817, did you try DEbian ?
[03:54] <motin> wrrrrrrrrite on repeattttttttttt
[03:54] <Arwen> h08817, you need a version of linux designed for old hardware (how is it you have a 1.3G disk?)
[03:54] <h08817> HymnToLife, yes and it croaked on some step
[03:54] <motin> thhhhannnnnnnk yooou
[03:54] <Arwen> cmweb, no, gnome-ppp is not installed default
[03:54] <LjL> motin: https://launchpad.net/bugs/39315
[03:55] <HymnToLife> you're definitely out of luck...
[03:55] <h08817> Arwen, i have just had this small disk when i had win98 long ago
[03:55] <cmweb> arweb, will it do the shortcut?
[03:55] <motin> ccheckingggggg oooouuuuut thxxxxxx ljllll
[03:55] <Arwen> cmweb, yea, you need to go to apps > internet > gnome-ppp and manually add it though
[03:55] <h08817> HymnToLife, yeah i think so but i did get ubuntu installed on my hd that is 160GB with windows
[03:55] <cmweb> ok, thanks arwen
[03:56] <cntb> exact path to kernel sources
[03:56] <Arwen> h08817, heh - try damn small linux, gentoo, slackware, or some other minimal version
[03:56] <h08817> HymnToLife, but i got the grub 17 error
[03:56] <LjL> motin: make sure you install all updates, for starters. besides that, that bug report has a few suggestions... none of them appears to solve it for everyone though :-\
[03:56] <Arwen> cntb, ?
[03:56] <Pie-rate> I think my ping times in most games went up very substantially when i switched to linux. is linux networking better than windows?
[03:56] <Arwen> Pie-rate, kinda and kinda not
[03:56] <w30> cmweb, can't you customize the login scripts in kppp? If you can't install a program called Xisp and you can
[03:56] <Arwen> Pie-rate, make sure your MTU/MRU are set right
[03:56] <Pie-rate> Arwen: explain?
[03:56] <motin> i willlll bbbbbbbbbbtuuttt it is nooooooooot tttttthee rrrighhhhhht buuggg
[03:57] <Pie-rate> MTU/MRU?
[03:57] <Arwen> Pie-rate, they're just different, none is really better
[03:57] <Arwen> Pie-rate, Maximum Transmittable/Recievable Unit - controls how large your packets are
[03:57] <cntb> nvidia needs path to --kernel-source
[03:57] <Arwen> Pie-rate, if its too high, you get fragmentation, if its too low, then you get slowness
[03:57] <Arwen> cntb, /usr/src/linux-whatever I think...
[03:58] <jastarafi> not sure
[03:58] <Boelcke> Hi. Any thoughts on why audio might be choppy for movie playback, but fine for everything else? (Using Mplayer...)
[03:58] <Pie-rate> so its possible that my ping is different due to packet size differences between windows and linux?
[03:58] <ThePub> is there a web browser comparable to Konquerer that's GTK based?
[03:58] <Arwen> Boelcke, 100% CPU?
[03:58] <cntb> tyvm arwen
[03:58] <Arwen> Boelcke, bad audio card?
[03:58] <Arwen> Boelcke, low RAM?
[03:58] <finchx6> thepub, not a fan of firefox??
[03:58] <cntb> did updatedb && locate kernel-source
[03:58] <Arwen> Boelcke, oh yea... and is DRM off?
[03:59] <Boelcke> Arwen, it plays audio fine, and the hardware seems to work fine when I boot with DamnSmall Linux. I'm thinking a codec or something?
[03:59] <Arwen> Boelcke, tried another media player (VLC is great)?
[03:59] <w3ccv> motin, a few ideas on your problem. Holding the keys down too long - could be the repeat timer, or you are sleeping on the keyboard. Or you just plain have a bad kbd.  Unplug it, thn plug it back in, see what happens
[03:59] <Boelcke> Arwen, but I'm using Mplayer, used EasyUbuntu to set it up (succesful on other machines).
[03:59] <ThePub> finchx6: not that at all, not trying to offend anyone :)  FF is a slow starter and Konq is not, plus FF doesn't render pages quite as nicely ;)
[03:59] <Pie-rate> gah i meant my ping times went DOWN, haha
[03:59] <motin> w3ccv noottebok
[03:59] <Arwen> Boelcke, anyway, is there anything different about this machine?
[04:00] <yi> hello, does anyone know where I can find information on how to create a custom ubuntu livecd?
[04:00] <yi> I need to make livecd's that contain a specific software package
[04:00] <cmwe1> am i in?
[04:00] <Boelcke> Arwen, no, not much different.  The files in question are from my own camera (no DRM). They play fine on my other UbuntuBox.
[04:00] <finchx6> thepub, touche
[04:00] <cmwe1> ok i am
[04:00] <finchx6> lol
[04:00] <motin> inittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttial press nnot rec oooooonnnly rrrreact on repppppeat
[04:00] <Boelcke> Arwen, I'm going to load up VLC and see what that does...
[04:00] <cmwe1> arwen, now you said that i can add a dialup link on my desktop in gnome-ppp how?
[04:00] <Arwen> Boelcke, anyway, I'm not sure what's wrong - try VLC with messages on
[04:01] <w3ccv> motin, plug in a keyboard and see if it still presists. Have you tried a cold shutdonw and repeat
[04:01] <Arwen> cmwe1, you have it installed? then right-click the link in the apps menu and choose "add to desktop"
[04:01] <w3ccv> s/repeat/reboot/
[04:01] <motin> w3ccv yesx2
[04:01] <w3ccv> motin, sounds likeyou need a new keyboard
[04:01] <cmwe1> Thanks!!!!
[04:01] <motin> notebook
[04:02] <Arwen> cmwe1, if you have a weird winmodem, make sure to configure it
[04:02] <motin> itisnot hw - sis sw
[04:02] <w3ccv> motin  most notebooks have a keyboard jack on the back
[04:02] <cmwe1> its connected right now
[04:02] <haary> yi, did you try http://www.livedistro.org/resources/software/build-tools/mybuntu----custom-ubuntu-live-cd-build-scripts?PHPSESSID=863bd40d86bb0c51628283d47c90c61a ?
[04:02] <motin> w33cccccccv yes tried
[04:02] <motin> no sol
[04:02] <Arwen> does anyone here want to give their opinion on dedicated sound cards? are they necessary?
[04:02] <bobbie__4> i like ubuntu
[04:02] <w3ccv> motin, if you're it's software, then it is the repeat times.  Reset it.
[04:02] <slinky_> Hello, I am running Dapper, I added Glade 2.12.1 using add/remove ... but when i run it i have no help, can't anyone help me get help :)
[04:03] <finchx6> well, I think I'm going to go see if I can reinstall edgy AGAIN and see if I can possibly get xgl up without having to format again
[04:03] <yi> haary: thanks for the link, but unfortunately the site that it links to is down =/
[04:03] <bobbie__4> Arwen , sound cards are good, stay away from unsound cards
[04:03] <Arwen> bobbie__4, unsound?
[04:03] <finchx6> arwen...  i've found they're not necessary but helpful..  lol
[04:03] <bobbie__4> yeah, unstable. you don't want an unstable card.
[04:03] <Arwen> ok - sound card = optional, are graphics cards a necessity (not integrated)?
[04:03] <Arwen> bobbie__4, such as?
[04:04] <akk> Arwen: Depends on how good your motherboard card is. Some of them are awful, but a lot are good enough if you're not an audiophile.
[04:04] <bobbie__4> a psychotic card, or a homocidal card. Those are bad cards
[04:04] <Arwen> akk, ok - and graphics?
[04:04] <haary> yi, forget the link, it is broken, try http://uck.sourceforge.net/ instead
[04:04] <finchx6> arwen: i'm running a 256mb nvidia 7800 card that runs beautifully as soon as I install the drivers for it
[04:04] <Arwen> finchx6, think I can get along with software rendering or integrated?
[04:04] <akk> Arwen: Depends -- I hear the intel mobo chips are pretty good under Linux, but most others probably aren't.
[04:05] <Arwen> akk, ok
[04:05] <finchx6> you should be ok...
[04:05] <Arwen> last thing - integrated vs dedicated network card?
[04:05] <motin_tty> aha
[04:05] <finchx6> either
[04:05] <Arwen> finchx6, with software rendering?
[04:05] <motin_tty> here from tty the keyboard works great
[04:05] <bobbie__4> Arwen on a serious note, I love my Sound Blaster Audigy LS.
[04:05] <jj_> Hello
[04:05] <motin_tty> damn this keyboard problem
[04:05] <motin_tty> w3cc
[04:05] <Arwen> bobbie__4, never had a system with a real sound card for comparison, lol
[04:05] <motin_tty> do you have any ideas to what is wrong?
[04:06] <bobbie__4> I'm using the digital audio output and feeding the via a coax into my Sony receiver
[04:06] <Boelcke> Arwen, RE: choppy sound in video: I tried VLC, and on the first .AVI file I played, I get perfect audio, but no video!!!  Sigh.
[04:06] <motin_tty> gnome is totally ignoring the initial key-press
[04:06] <felixjet3> compiz works with aixgl ? or need xgl ?
[04:06] <akk> Arwen: Anything works fine for networking, onboard is fine as long as linux recognizes it.
[04:06] <Arwen> Boelcke, what does the messages window say?
[04:06] <Boelcke> Messages full of errors, including a Computer too slow? question.
[04:06] <finchx6> arwen, they can make an amazing difference if linux can just take full advantage of them... if not, then you won't see much difference
[04:06] <jj_> Hey
[04:06] <Arwen> akk, ok - sorry for saying last thing last time... but what about hardware raid vs software?
[04:06] <slinky_> Hello, I am running Dapper, I added Glade 2.12.1 using add/remove ... but when i run it i have no help, can't anyone help me get help
[04:06] <motin_tty> only the simulated repeated keypresses due to holding of the key is recognized!
[04:06] <finchx6> like, I could take my SB live 5.1 card out, and use onboard sound, and not see a difference in ubuntu
[04:06] <w3ccv> motin_tty, my guess is you have a bad keyboard, they are not too sturdy, how does it work if you boot into wozdurz
[04:06] <akk> Arwen: I'm no help on that one. I think they're pretty different but I don't use raid at all.
[04:07] <Boelcke> Arwen, a lot of "late picture skipped" errors, and "more than 5 seconds of video skipped..."
[04:07] <w3ccv> s/sozdurz/woddurz/
[04:07] <motin_tty> w3ccv - i am using the keyboard right now
[04:07] <motin_tty> it is nothing wrong with it
[04:07] <akk> Arwen: I think I vaguely remember being told that linux software raid was better than most hardware raid, but I couldn't tell you why
[04:07] <Arwen> Boelcke, hrmm.... where is the video located?
[04:07] <quadrata> Arwen: hardware raid is always prefereable to software raid
[04:07] <quadrata> akk: incorrect
[04:07] <Arwen> akk, CPU is probably more powerful than the chip
[04:07] <w3ccv> motin_tty, then there is no problem
[04:07] <motin_tty> it is something wrong with the way gnome handles the key inputs
[04:07] <Arwen> on the cheap RAID cards
[04:07] <motin_tty> come on...
[04:07] <slinky_> I can't seem to find help files for Glade, it there something i should add using synaptic?
[04:07] <motin_tty> i cannot use my keyboard in gnome!
[04:08] <motin_tty> of course there is something wrong
[04:08] <jj_> I'm sorry to hear that
[04:08] <Music_Shuffle1> motin_tty, can you use it in KDE?
[04:08] <motin_tty> it is not hw-related but sw-related
[04:08] <akk> It wasn't so much the speed, I think, but that they were doing different things, and linux sw raid was more flexible. Or something.
[04:08] <jj_> \join ubuntu
[04:08] <jj_> \join #ubuntu
[04:08] <motin_tty> Music_Sh... i guess havent tried
[04:08] <motin_tty> it stopped working 3 hours ago in gnome
[04:08] <slinky_> motin_tty: what keyboard
[04:08] <Music_Shuffle1> Try it, if its still an error, its the board.
[04:08] <w3ccv> motin_tty, sounds like yo know the answer
[04:08] <motin_tty> slinky all keyboards
[04:08] <quadrata> akk: I would think that would depend on the hardware - but software raid takes a hit on system performance
[04:08] <Arwen> akk, its software - software can do anything if the programmer is good
[04:08] <motin_tty> the notebook integrated and attached usb keyboards
[04:08] <Boelcke> Arwen, video in a subfolder in home.  Again, it plays fine in damnsmalllinux, so it's got to be some setup/driver/codec issue, right?
[04:09] <jj_> hey
[04:09] <slinky_> motin_tty: did you try turning it off and on
[04:09] <motin_tty> ~yes
[04:09] <akk> Arwen: And if the programmer isn't good, it might do just about anything ...
[04:09] <jj_> can anyone read this ?
[04:09] <motin_tty> cold reboot
[04:09] <tonyyarusso> jj_: yes
[04:09] <slinky_> i can read it
[04:09] <jj_> oh
[04:09] <jj_> thanks
[04:09] <Arwen> akk, true
[04:09] <finchx6> alright.... I'm off to screw up another install.  I'll probably be back
[04:10] <Arwen> Boelcke, what video output mode have you selected? Try XVideo then OpenGL then X11
[04:10] <jj_> Well, does anyone have time to answer a somewhat simple question
[04:10] <slinky_> I am having problems with help files in many programs, F1 does nothing, any ideas

[04:12] <motin_tty> please
[04:12] <Arwen> the one thing I found out about linux was that my good old viruses didn't run - but then I discovered wine and all is well!
[04:13] <I_hate_spyware> im looking for a userfrendly ubatun server web isntaller so i can have a http server and a ftp server
[04:13] <motin_tty> my computer is rendered useless with a working keyboard
[04:13] <jj_> createdb: could not connect to database postgres: FATAL:  role "jj" does not exist
[04:13] <slinky_> i have read everything i can find for a month now and I can't get help when i press F1 in many applications, any ideas
[04:13] <Boelcke> Arwen, yes, I tried all three, all showed stuck on the first frame of video, and played the audio fine.  I do have a new observation though...
[04:13] <Arwen> Boelcke, hmm?
[04:13] <Boelcke> Arwen, every time I play it, the SysMon is showing 100% CPU.
[04:13] <pradeep> I_hate_spyware, do you mean ubuntu server?
[04:13] <Arwen> Boelcke, ah.... hrmm... do you have video overlay and dma enabled?
[04:13] <jj_> then I do not have the user permissions set up correctly for running postgres
[04:14] <I_hate_spyware> like i want to start a ftp server and http
[04:14] <yi> haary: can you speak at all to the quality of those scripts?
[04:14] <nybble> howdy
[04:14] <yi> haary: have they worked well for you?
[04:14] <Boelcke> Arwen, this is on an old P3, and the messages are suggesting that the CPU is overloaded.  Sysmon shows 100%. Checking overlay & dma...
[04:14] <Music_Shuffle1> You...overloaded the CPU using Ubuntu?
[04:14] <Boelcke> Arwen, I think I have DMA enabled, what do you mean by overlay?
[04:14] <haary> yi. i didn't try them, but it's looking promising
[04:15] <Arwen> Boelcke, video overlay, passes video directly to your graphics card
[04:15] <Arwen> could just be your cpu though - what codecs are your file in?

[04:17] <tokeman> how do I get eggdrop to work?......
[04:17] <Boelcke> Arwen, using_dma=1 (on).  Er, you're losing me on the video directly to the graphics card.  How can I check that?
[04:17] <beg1689> hey guys, quick question
[04:17] <pradeep> I_hate_spyware, you could just install desktop ubuntu then, and use the kernel meant for the server
[04:17] <Arwen> Boelcke, if you haven't changed your settings, its probably on
[04:17] <beg1689> i have only every used one linux dist, fedora core, is ubuntu a lot better?
[04:17] <Boelcke> Arwen, by the way, thanks for the help & advice... ;)
[04:17] <Arwen> Boelcke, what format is your video (don't say avi - what codec?)
[04:17] <Arwen> Boelcke, pssh... nobody answers my questions so I have lots of timee, lol
[04:17] <I_hate_spyware> um not the best with knowing my way around linux
[04:17] <pradeep> beg1689, it depends ... you could give it a try :)
[04:18] <slinky_> where can i find documentation for Glade 2.12.1
[04:18] <beg1689> well in that case... whats the best way to shrink a partition in linux :)
[04:18] <Boelcke> Arwen, I've got AVI files from Canon cameras, and MOV files from a Panasonic camera.  I'm not sure what codec, but both kinds have choppy video.
[04:18] <Arwen> Boelcke, if its in H.264 or some other high CPU codec, could just be your CPU
[04:18] <kurisutofuaa> How do I mount my iPod in Edgy amd64?
[04:18] <Arwen> Boelcke, try running the command "file videoname" - they might actually be lossless video
[04:19] <yi> is there an equivalent of /etc/version for ubuntu?
[04:19] <yi> how do I find out what version of ubuntu a system is running
[04:19] <pradeep> I_hate_spyware, the desktop ubuntu is easy enough to set up FTP and HTTP servers ...
[04:19] <Arwen> yi, /etc/debian-release
[04:19] <sanityx> I'm having a really strange problem. No matter what wireless network I'm connected to, B, G, or otherwise, no matter what the source is, I can't ever download anything faster than 20 KB/s under linux.
[04:19] <I_hate_spyware> k how whold i do this
[04:19] <yi> Arwen: great, thanks!
[04:19] <sanityx> I download the same thing from the same site under windows, and its works at full speed. So its not an issue with the source.
[04:19] <Arwen> yi, oh wait... that's not it
[04:20] <yi> Arwen: what is it then?
[04:20] <Arwen> yi, one sec...
[04:20] <Arwen> yi, /etc/debian_version
[04:20] <pradeep> !download | I_hate_spyware
[04:20] <ubotu> I_hate_spyware: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[04:20] <Boelcke> Arwen, I guess I'm still stick on the fact that damnsmalllinux plays the videos ok, though I don't know what codec it uses (I'd like to know!)
[04:21] <I_hate_spyware> the cd cam in the mail
[04:21] <I_hate_spyware> i got the cd
[04:21] <Arwen> Boelcke, toss the command "file videofilename.avi" into a terminal
[04:21] <Boelcke> Arwen, file mvi_0084.avi yields: mvi_0084.avi: RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 640 x 480, 30.00 fps, video: Motion JPEG, audio: uncompressed PCM (mono, 11024 Hz)
[04:21] <jj_> Who would be able to answer a question on how to setup PostgreSQL in Ubuntu?
[04:21] <slinky_> !Glade
[04:21] <Arwen> Boelcke, there we go - MJPEG 0 badly supported
[04:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Glade - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:21] <I_hate_spyware> oh i got a nother problem
[04:21] <Boelcke> Arwen the MOV files say Apple QuickTime movie (unoptimized).
[04:21] <pradeep> I_hate_spyware, what's stopping you? :) install it ...
[04:22] <Arwen> Boelcke, the MOVs must be in Sorenson - try playing them?
[04:22] <I_hate_spyware> i tryed to install this thing but on my mac i got a wigte screen with a error on on a ibook g3
[04:22] <motin_> back again in gnome with a working keyboar
[04:22] <kurisutofuaa> How do I mount my iPod in Edgy amd64?
[04:22] <motin_> wow one is really left out in the blue without a working keyboard!
[04:22] <I_hate_spyware> be right back
[04:22] <motin_> i found a serious flaw in X-Chat
[04:23] <motin_> it doesnt allow sending messages with the mouse!
[04:23] <Boelcke> Arwen, the MOVs play choppy in mplayer.  Trying now in VLC...
[04:23] <motin_> i used dasher to construct a help-call - but couldnt send it
[04:23] <motin_> where is the Send-button?
[04:23] <I_hate_spyware> back
[04:24] <Boelcke> Arwen, VLC gave great audio, but only 3 or 4 total frames of video shown.  Messages full of "late picture skipped, dropping frame, slow CPU?"
[04:25] <Arwen> Boelcke, probably slow CPU - sorenson is similar to H264 in that way
[04:25] <Arwen> do you have a faster computer (they may be MJPEG too)?
[04:26] <I_hate_spyware> ill be right back ill get my ibook
[04:26] <Arwen> Myria, 64bit not ready for end users ye
[04:26] <I_hate_spyware> and the cd
[04:26] <Arwen> Boelcke, I gotta go to sleep... sorry for being unable to fix
[04:27] <slinky_> i finally found it, http://glade.gnome.org/ for anyone who might be interested
[04:27] <QwertyM> omg beryl's flame effect is too cool o.O
[04:28] <akk> Lots of 32-bit stuff is missing in 64-bit -- like whatever libs google earth needs. :-(
[04:28] <willian> holas
[04:29] <Myria> i guess fedora core is better for that then
[04:29] <akk> Yes, I hear FC can handle 64+32 bit pretty well.
[04:29] <akk> I should try it sometime.
[04:30] <Pelo> damit
[04:31] <Pelo> my dvd-rw won't stay closed
=== acez is now known as aceZ
[04:32] <necrodrako> in ubuntu is there a program for opening rar files?
[04:32] <Pelo> is there some sort of process viewer that I can use to monitor what keeps opening it ?
[04:32] <Pelo> necrodrako,  yes,  look for rar in synaptic
[04:32] <yi> what is the X configuration utility called in ubuntu?
[04:32] <yi> I am running ubuntu in parallels and am having a little trouble with the video resolution
[04:33] <akk> Pelo: you could run lsof | grep /dev/whatever in a loop
[04:33] <Pelo> yi,   xserver-xorg
[04:33] <Pelo> akk  , seems a bit over my head
[04:33] <Pie-rate> yi, vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:33] <Pelo> what does the waterver stand for ?
[04:34] <akk> Pelo: Try typing lsof | grep cdrom (or cdrw or whatever the device's name is) and see what it gives you
[04:35] <kurisutofuaa> necrodrako, http://www.ricardocabello.com/?postid=247 here is a helpful site

[04:36] <lemonsCC> yes

[04:38] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: the minimal install is more than that
=== _greenie__ is now known as _greenie
[04:39] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: we can customize the Ubuntu live CD, why not debian
[04:39] <Therealmadhatter> hey whats the best way to dual boot between windows and linux
[04:39] <QwertyM> grub^^
[04:39] <Pelo> grub

[04:39] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: i was talking about ubuntu minimal install...its 300megs
[04:40] <HymnToLife> Therealmadhatter, nothing special to do, just install Ubuntu
[04:40] <frogzoo> Therealmadhatter: have a separate partition for windows, best if it's not the first partition
[04:40] <HymnToLife> (hoho, I'm a great poet :p)
[04:40] <Therealmadhatter> i ahve to partitons
[04:40] <Therealmadhatter> hwo do i swicth between the 2
[04:40] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: ok, we were talking about the install Cd, not the liveCD?
[04:40] <necrodrako> also
[04:41] <necrodrako> is there a more stable skype
[04:41] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: i mean u

[04:41] <I_hate_spyware> um isit ok to install ubutub on a g3 ibook with about 250 mb of ram and im going t o erace the 10gb hard drive
[04:41] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: you want a 50 meg liveCD?
[04:41] <necrodrako> but i still hear the other party
[04:41] <Therealmadhatter> hwo to i set up grup
[04:41] <lemonsCC> !grub
[04:41] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[04:42] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: i already have it, i want to add packages, but i am not sure what i should be adding to make it work better, i mean those drivers and all that
[04:42] <I_hate_spyware> !live cd
[04:42] <ubotu> Ubuntu Dapper 'Desktop' CD contains a Live CD (Ubuntu that runs straight off the CD and RAM) with an install option. Breezy's Live CD contained no install.
[04:42] <feryana> is possible to deactivate a keyboard (I have a keyboard plugged to a laptop and I would like to deactivate laptop's integrated keyboard!!!!
[04:43] <kwood> Is it possible to install LAMP with the ubuntu graphical features upon installation? ie LAMP + the features of  ubuntu install
[04:43] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: what packages? you could use aptitude to do a fake install and see what the dependencies are...
[04:43] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: man aptitude will tell you how
[04:43] <rexbron> kwood: Install a lamp and then install ubuntu-desktopp?
[04:44] <kwood> rex: would that be difficult? I have both the desktop and install cd..
[04:44] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: thanks i will try it
[04:44] <lemonsCC> sudo aptitude -s <package> will simulate the install
[04:45] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: just note what is needed and add it to the liveCD
[04:45] <tim167> how do I make a usb trackball ('marble mouse') work after plugging it in ?
[04:45] <jw> Hello everyone :)
[04:45] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: actually sudo isnt needed so just "aptitude -s <package>
[04:46] <lemonsCC> !hi | jw
[04:46] <ubotu> jw: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:46] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: ok, got it thank you, can u give me some linkss
[04:46] <tim167> never mind, trackball works now, it took 40 seconds to become active
[04:46] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: man page for aptitude >> http://nixdoc.net/man-pages/Linux/man1/aptitude.1.html
[04:46] <jw> I'm on a fresh install of Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy, can someone direct me to where I can setup my soundblaster sound card please?
[04:46] <rexbron> kwood: Do the lamp server install then "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
[04:47] <rexbron> kwood: I am pretty sure that ubuntu desktop depends on things like X,org
[04:47] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: liveCD customization >> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/6%2e06
[04:47] <jw> I just formatted Windows XP Pro, I got tired of the viruses and system instability
[04:47] <rexbron> leme check
[04:47] <kwood> rexbron: so i would use the server install then run the install of u desktop?
[04:47] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: but first i need to unzip the squashFS on the live CD, is it same for Ubuntu and Debian
[04:47] <feryana> jw very good idea!!!
[04:48] <jw> feryana, :) thanks
[04:48] <rexbron> kwood: ubuntu-desktop depends on xorg, so you should be set for GUI's
[04:48] <feryana> jw I have only Ubuntu on my system almost a year ago
[04:48] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: i couldn't say for sure...ubuntu is debian based, so should be
[04:48] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: ok i will try
[04:48] <rexbron> kwood: leme check with a friend
[04:48] <rexbron> kwood: hes done this before
[04:48] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: thanks a  lot
[04:48] <kwood> rexbron: alright thanks
[04:48] <akk> jw: Why breezy, out of curiosity? Not that there's anything wrong with it.
[04:48] <lemonsCC> y3it221_klce: just use a cd-rw so you can test it and reburn if it doesnt work
[04:49] <lemonsCC> ] P
[04:49] <lemonsCC> =P
[04:49] <feryana> jw Media Center is even worst, one of my customers has it and it gives more problems and has more bugs lmao
[04:49] <akk> (breezy is actually the last ubuntu that runs reasonably on my laptop, so maybe it's not a bad idea)
[04:49] <rexbron> kwood: darn, he is asleep
[04:49] <kwood> hmm
[04:49] <kwood> alright
[04:49] <rexbron> kwood: but you should be fine
[04:49] <jw> akk, I  downloaded the latest version of Ubuntu and tryed installing it but once it got to the CD bootup screen, everything is black and my monitor would just shutdown (standby)
[04:50] <rexbron> kwood: This will give you the server funtionality with a regular desktop
[04:50] <kwood> OK.. nasically waht I was looking for is a quick and dirty LAMP then being able to learn etc... and would like the ubuntu graphical interface to help me out
[04:50] <kwood> installation etc.
[04:50] <sysrage> anybody have a problem where only a few seconds of a flash video will play at a time?
[04:50] <feryana> jw do you have a laptop or desktop
[04:50] <akk> jw: With the live CD? A lot of people (including me) had to use the install CD, the live version didn't work in edgy on a lot of machines
[04:50] <jw> feryana, Desktop :)
[04:50] <akk> The edgy install does have a lot of problems, though.
[04:51] <kwood> rexbron: this command? "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
[04:51] <feryana> jw the desktop cd didn't work good for me in my other piii comp
[04:51] <rexbron> kwood: http://www.howtoforge.com/lamp_installation_ubuntu6.06
[04:51] <feryana> jw why you don't downoad the install cd, and you install it from the console
[04:51] <sysrage> jw: i had the same problem on this laptop, i had to disable DMA
[04:51] <rexbron> kwood: that is a good tutorial
[04:51] <kurisutofuaa> How do I mount my iPod?
[04:51] <kwood> k thx ill check it out
[04:51] <jw> akk, I was unaware that there  was an install CD? I figured the Live CD was the install CD? I tryed installing from Windows XP and a straight reboot to the CD, I got the same results
[04:51] <kwood> i think i saw it for 6.10 also
[04:51] <rexbron> kwood: oh ok
[04:51] <rexbron> that was just google
[04:52] <akk> jw: It's labeled as the "alternate install CD" or something like that -- and it gives you pretty much the same installer that breezy had.
[04:52] <feryana> jw go to ubuntu..com and download the "alternative" one
[04:52] <jw> sysrage, you fixed the problem I am having by disabling DMA in BIOS?
[04:52] <sysrage> not in bios
[04:52] <feryana> burn it and reboot you pc with the disk in the driver, and whuala :)
[04:52] <rexbron> akk: Its the text based debian installer rather than ubiquity
[04:52] <jw> feryana, I'll do that now :) 1 sec
[04:52] <sysrage> i booted into safe mode or recovery mode or whatever they call it, edited /etc/X11/xorg.conf and added: Option          "DmaMode" "None"
[04:52] <lemonsCC> jw: the live Cd is the install Cd for 6.06 and up
[04:52] <feryana> I think that the name was alternative
[04:52] <lemonsCC> jw: it requires 128mb of RAM tho
[04:52] <feryana> let me check
[04:52] <akk> rexbron: I got the text-based installer in breezy too -- was there some other way?
[04:53] <lemonsCC> !lowmemory

[04:53] <rexbron> from edgy
[04:53] <rexbron> kwood: I read it over

[04:53] <I_hate_spyware> lol
[04:53] <lemonsCC> akk: much has changed since 5.10
[04:53] <rexbron> akk: lol best of juck
[04:53] <kwood> it looks like 6.06 has a install LAMP from the boot cd... 6.10 does not have that
[04:53] <rexbron> akk: luck
[04:54] <HLM> !gyach
[04:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gyach - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:54] <lemonsCC> akk: what hardware do you have?
[04:54] <rexbron> kwood: you need to download the server install cd
[04:54] <y3it221_klce> lemonsCC: can i know where can i get the extra repositories for debain?
[04:54] <kwood> rexbron: but it looks like sudo apt-get update will still work
[04:54] <akk> lemonsCC: laptop is a vaio sr17. The desktop is actually relatively modern and might be able to run edgy -- I haven't tried yet.

[04:57] <feryana> jw the version doesn't matter at all, is important the dist (dapper drake) when you intall that you will receive the updates and you will be running 6.10 :)
[04:58] <jw> The only reason I switched back to Windows XP a few months back was because I couldn't get Quake 1 to play 100% like it would on Windows

[05:00] <sysrage> and it was still kinda buggy, but multi would work for a little while
[05:00] <lemonsCC> jw: you have 5.10 installed?

[05:00] <SilentDis> problem:  just installed the binary blob drivers from Nvidia's website, they 'work'... but as soon as I restart X or reboot the machine, they stop working.  what am I doing wrong?
[05:00] <I_hate_spyware> i had that worms game but before i could sue the cd broke :'(
[05:00] <blanky> tonyyarusso: hahahahaha
[05:00] <fwtest> hello, anyone has idea what SBUA behind a user agent mean?
[05:00] <sysrage> Super Badass User Agent
[05:00] <feryana> I been 2 months without playing... i freaked out but now I'm out from that drug of the little wormies :P
[05:01] <lemonsCC> jw: check this out and you can see for yourself... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DapperUpgrades#head-8f6f04846f29e7ce769e50cbfd30f0d4a301f12c
[05:01] <bayzide> right now im on a ubuntu live cd. Can i move a file over to my windows partition?
[05:01] <Myria> highly unlikely
[05:01] <Myria> most live cd's don't have ntfs write support
[05:01] <HymnToLife> unless i is formatted as FAT32 ;)
[05:02] <tonyyarusso> bayzide: Giant maybe.  You can definitely take things off a Windows partition, but writing to them is very sketchy.
[05:02] <I_hate_spyware> knoppix dose
[05:02] <kurisutofuaa> How do I mount my iPod?
[05:02] <HymnToLife> it*
[05:02] <SilentDis> bayzide:  if the target is a fat32 drive, yes.  otherwise, you'd have to muck around with NTFS support... and that's REALLY a pain on a live-cd environment
[05:02] <madman91> hello guys.... i got a small problem .. pastebin describes it.. http://madman91.pastebin.ca/273791   .. INSHORT it is a small execution problem.. i cant start a simple program
[05:02] <lemonsCC> knoppix hat ntfs write suppport????
[05:02] <Pelo> kurisutofuaa,  doesn'T it just automount ?
[05:02] <I_hate_spyware> ya
[05:02] <bayzide> well.... could i move the info over to say my ipod then boot into windows a simple drag and drop?>
[05:02] <jw> lemonCC, Thanks for the link, I'm going to do a fresh install of Ubuntu 6.06
[05:02] <madman91> bayzide: yea
[05:03] <feryana> kurisutofuaa like a normal drive maybe?
[05:03] <madman91> bayzide: unless your ipod is formatted with the mac filesystem
[05:03] <lemonsCC> jw: fresh always works best for me.
[05:03] <SilentDis> bayzide:  i was gonna recommend a key fob drive or the like, but if you can view files on your iPod like a drive, then that'll work too :)
[05:03] <SilentDis> problem:  just installed the binary blob drivers from Nvidia's website, they 'work'... but as soon as I restart X or reboot the machine, they stop working.  what am I doing wrong?
[05:03] <kurisutofuaa> Pelo, it doesn't want to automount
[05:03] <bayzide> my ipods a fat32
[05:03] <Pelo> madman91,  looks to me like you are missng a dependency, but then I am a bit of a noob when it comes to this stuff
[05:04] <brussel> Is there anything special I need to do to get java installed on firefox using 6.10 desktop?
[05:04] <madman91> Pelo: yea i read that libgtk thing.. but i dont know what to do
[05:04] <I_hate_spyware> my thumdrive says it dosnet support ntfs filesystem i was ok then a littel bit latter i proved it wrong
[05:04] <Pelo> kurisutofuaa, I am sure there is something about this in the forum
[05:04] <Pelo> madman91,  install libgtk ...
[05:05] <Pelo> madman91,  and the -dev package to for good measure
[05:05] <feryana> brussel use the synaptics and search "java" then install the non free one (you need to have enabled multiverse)
[05:05] <lemonsCC> madman91: sudo apt-get install libgtk
[05:05] <kurisutofuaa> Pelo, Been looking for the last 3 hours in the forums
[05:05] <SilentDis> problem:  just installed the binary blob drivers from Nvidia's website, they 'work'... but as soon as I restart X or reboot the machine, they stop working.  what am I doing wrong?

[05:08] <lemonsCC> madman91: search synaptic (System > Administratin > Synaptic) for that libgtk thing

[05:08] <Pelo> madman91,  use synaptic and search for libgtk, install what shows up
[05:08] <angel12> hey guys, ive got a question that doesnt really have to do with ubuntu, more hardware based. can a bad stick of ram make the computer just freeze?

[05:09] <Pelo> lemonsCC,   typo but It was so good I decided to keep it
[05:09] <feryana> angel12 I had that issue with a piii laptop... I think that is a problem of the vga... not the ram... what type of pc ? g card does your pc has? it's a dell piii?
[05:09] <lemonsCC> SilentDis: some of the new digital cameras can play mp3's now
[05:10] <SilentDis> lemonsCC:  that's just... i have no response to that.  lol

[05:10] <angel12> feryana, i have a compaq desktop, i just put a new geforce 6200 in it today, so i know its not the video card ram

[05:11] <lemonsCC> madman91: lol if it doesnt help uninstall them
[05:11] <SilentDis> lemonsCC:  my point exactly.  whatever happened to cellphones that... well... allow you to make calls?

[05:12] <angel12> SilentDis, im one for the cell that can do everything, i have a smart phone and i love it. but see, i converted from using a palm pilot and a cell phone, i never had room in my pockets for anything
[05:12] <Pelo> madman91,   stick to the short ones, with libgtk in the title,  and try instaling the one with -dev at the end to,   actualy, if you install libgtk-dev it should instal the basic one as well, start with that
[05:12] <QwertyM> I mean themes for Emerald or beryl whatever lemonsCC
[05:12] <Rug> Howdy all
[05:12] <Pelo> QwertyM,  gnome look ?
[05:12] <lemonsCC> angel12: thats a little different...we are talking about basic function cell phones, not the Q

[05:18] <ubotu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info

[05:20] <feryana> necrodrako www.skype.com
[05:20] <Pelo> madman91,  I assume this is a package you installed from source ? try and read the readme and install files from the package to see what the dependencies are and make sure they are all installed
[05:20] <necrodrako> automatix is not stable
[05:20] <lemonsCC> !automatix | guerrero
[05:20] <ubotu> guerrero: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.

[05:33] <Akashima> Hi there, i tried to boot ubuntu 6.10 from the live CD, but after the screen with the loading bar, it doesn't apear anything but a light-brown background with my mouse pointer, can anybody help me?

[05:33] <angel12> roostishaw, i dont know why it isnt working now. it might
[05:33] <feryana> I_hate_spyware all of those with Ubuntu?
[05:33] <nugz> i just dont know the linux part
[05:33] <nugz> of it
[05:33] <guerrero> necrodrako: I had similar experience with skype...disconnects randomly....could be firewall issues
[05:33] <guerrero> necrodrako: are you in the DMZ?
[05:33] <roostishaw> angel12, ill try it now; thank you for helping
[05:33] <monoxide> anyone have an idea on how to view my NTSF drives

[05:33] <madman91> Pelo: just double click
[05:34] <wpc> i need a spot of help, i'm just starting with ubuntu and everything it displays is a bit slow and ridiculous.  i have a decent nvidia card in the computer.  my suspicion is that it is not detecting it properly.  any suggestions?
[05:34] <madman91> Pelo: change permissions to allow execution
[05:34] <necrodrako> no but i have skype setup for portforwarding
[05:34] <necrodrako> i can still hear my friend but my side dies
[05:34] <frogzoo> nugz: your best bet would be to install edgy, & then click on the 'help' icon in the task bar to get started
[05:34] <I_hate_spyware> sadly no i whold like to but i dont got that much time
[05:34] <guerrero> necrodrako: if you are both behind firewalls..you are depending on someone else out there as go between..

[05:35] <feryana> I_hate_spyware why do you make a lan and install all of them from a servey... well takes a lot of time also, but less than one by one
[05:35] <lemonsCC> nugz: did you install ircd?
[05:35] <EDinNY> which lib do I need to create mp3's?

[05:36] <guerrero> necrodrako: i had similar random disconnects...even in the DMZ...I think it might just be a linux client issue
[05:36] <feryana> I tried it but pfff not time I have it in a flash drive
[05:36] <I_hate_spyware> i dont like damnliunx
[05:36] <nugz> i did the config on it

[05:36] <feryana> is weird
[05:36] <rajiv> i guess people are ignorant about automatix when it comes to codecs
[05:36] <heatxsink> hello all anyone in here have problems getting mod_pam working with apache2?
[05:36] <lemonsCC> nugz: the command to install it would be "sudo apt-get install ircd"
[05:36] <Pelo> madman91,  I can'T start it,  and I can'T realy be bothered right nowe
[05:37] <guerrero> rajiv: what do you mean?
[05:37] <madman91> Pelo: ok thanks for the help anyways
[05:37] <Akashima> I tried to boot ubuntu 6.10 from the live CD, but after the screen with the loading bar, it doesn't apear anything but a light-brown background with my mouse pointer, can anybody help me?

[05:37] <Pelo> madman91,   try to see if they have a forum maybe they can help you
[05:37] <I_hate_spyware> i got win95 or 98 some have 3.1 on most of my 36 comps
[05:37] <Pelo> forum / channel
[05:38] <lemonsCC> nugz:try  "sudo apt-get install ircd-ircu"
[05:38] <guerrero> rajiv: i just heard several people discourage use of automatix
[05:38] <asgilder> Why doesn't Rhythmbox import ALL my music?
[05:38] <nugz> cant find package
[05:39] <rajiv> ya man,even ive heard that,somehow you cant find the automatix page on ubuntuforums anymore
[05:39] <guerrero> rajiv: or is automatix ok for codecs?
[05:39] <what_if> guerrero: ok, I rebooted and now the cards have swapped addresses again, how do I make them _not_ do this?
[05:39] <lemonsCC> rajiv: i know about automatix and have used it...i also know that it is hard to troubleshoot
[05:39] <rajiv> but ive been using it since breezy,i havent broke my system
[05:39] <guerrero> what_if: did you set your default sound card in the prefs?

[05:39] <feryana> 98 second edition is the best wind... however 3.1 lol I dont remember it
[05:39] <feryana> well I forgot several things about windows
[05:40] <rajiv> wait a sec,you can install automatix but you really dont have to make it run to install stuffs
[05:40] <guerrero> what_if: by the way, you dont need to completely reboot...in a terminal do "sudo init 1"  that will bring you run level 1...then go back to run level 5 by tying "init 5"
[05:40] <feryana> too much time without viewing it :P
[05:40] <what_if> guerrero: yes, default sound card set
[05:40] <rajiv> just have a look at a file named edgy.autoscript(i dont remember where its located) and you'll get to see the files its installing
[05:40] <what_if> guerrero: nice
[05:40] <lemonsCC> type ircd or ircd-irc2 one of those should start something
[05:40] <guerrero> what_if: so the default sound card is correct and you get no sound?
[05:41] <nugz> i did ircd-irc2
[05:41] <angel12> are your speakers in?
[05:41] <necrodrako> i hate skype for this
[05:41] <guerrero> what_if: now try typing "alsamixer" on the command line...use the arrows to pump up all the volumes
[05:41] <nugz> can i talk to you in private message
[05:41] <nugz> ?
[05:41] <necrodrako> is there any other voice chat programs for both skype and windows
[05:41] <what_if> guerrero: no i get sound, I just have to change the settings on every program to point to the other soundcard everytime
[05:41] <lemonsCC> rajiv: that does not mean it works for everyone...it also is a PITA with the repos
[05:41] <guerrero> what_if: negative...default sound card should do it
[05:41] <necrodrako> both ubuntu and windows*
[05:42] <lemonsCC> nugz: i know next to nothing about ircd
[05:42] <ivx> does anyone in here know how to delete a db from phpmyadmin

[05:48] <Ar1> SATA Caviar
[05:48] <murali> lemonsCC:yes
[05:48] <Ar1> Brand spanking new
[05:48] <Ar1> Got it about a month ago
[05:49] <I_hate_spyware> anyone know whae i can get a ibook battery for under 50$ not ebay
[05:49] <lemonsCC> nugz: thats it?
[05:49] <Ar1> When I built my rig
[05:49] <zigford> Ar1
[05:49] <Ar1> Yup?
[05:49] <lemonsCC> I_hate_spyware: half.com..lol
[05:49] <Ar1> It saw an external USB drive, but not my internal one
[05:49] <zigford> Ar1: do you have any compatability modes in your bios?
[05:49] <Ar1> Legacy USB drivers I think
[05:49] <murali> ubotu:since u were talkin about sound config,i'd like to ask you if we can run audio from the command line...if yes,hou to do it???
[05:49] <ubotu> since: tail(1) work-alike that saves and uses state information. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5-3 (edgy), package size 8 kB, installed size 64 kB
[05:49] <zigford> Ar1: more like "legacy sata"
[05:49] <ablyss> agee: router may have pinging off
[05:49] <I_hate_spyware> if it cant see ur hard drive did you plug it into the mother bored right
[05:49] <Ar1> idk, I'm still new to the whole counter-corporation thing
[05:49] <Ar1> Oh yes
[05:50] <Ar1> Vista beta, which I have just booted out of, worked perfectly
[05:50] <Ar1> The hard drive works great in any other OS
[05:50] <lemonsCC> murali: what driver did it pick?  what graphics card do you have?
[05:50] <Rasta> nice, fresh edgy
[05:50] <I_hate_spyware> i have a program that mods windows xp and make it look just like vista for free no adware spyware etc
[05:50] <Ar1> I don't own XP
[05:50] <ValMarko> and, one thing is sure... since ubuntu is so secure I dont even mind using konqueror instead of  firefox. I know, firefox has so many addons. I just want to browse. Its not a real problem for me
[05:50] <Ar1> I tried to cut some corners in that department
[05:51] <Ar1> I had a Vista Beta cd lying around
[05:51] <Ar1> And I installed it to download Ubuntu
[05:51] <Rasta> where i have to look in order to have properly working audio(mp3) and video(divx/avi/mpg) ?
[05:51] <I_hate_spyware> im not saying the driclty to you im just saying it http://thepiratebay.org/
[05:51] <zigford> Ar1: I have seen problems with newer sata chipsets in linux not being supported yet.  However most of the time there is an option in the bios to run the hard drive in a compatability mode
[05:51] <Ar1> Hmm
[05:51] <rubso> Rasta: Ubuntu Wiki: RestrictedFormats
[05:51] <Ar1> So, my new Intel chipset mobo is having trouble with Ubuntu?
[05:52] <Rasta> rubso, going, thanks
[05:52] <Ar1> It's a socket 775 c2d
[05:52] <zigford> Ar1: Yep.  If you can, reboot and see what your sata options are
[05:52] <Ar1> Ok, be right back guys
[05:52] <murali> lemonsCC:the driver was ati..and i'm sorry i don have much idea about my card.. infact wen i first installed ubuntu,it worked jus great..but i'd problem with my resolution..it was jus givin me one resolution n tht was too big on my screen..so someone asked me to do the dpkg-reconfigure thingy..n i did..n since then its not woking
[05:53] <drivera90> hm
[05:53] <drivera90> is there a way to reopen a tab you just closed in firefox?
[05:53] <lemonsCC> murali: you could just set the driver (in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg) to vga or vesa if you aren't worried about acceleration
[05:54] <I_hate_spyware> sata resmbles Santa
[05:54] <lemonsCC> drivera90: don't think so...history may help

[05:56] <Madpilot> drivera90, in the new FF, doesn't Ctrl+Z (Undo) reopen a closed tab? (It does in Opera, I had thought that - once again - Fireforx had copied Opera...)

[05:57] <zigford> amen
[05:57] <rogo> has anyone tried Ubuntu CE ver 2.0 ?
[05:57] <lemonsCC> I_hate_spyware: bot just means less typing for me, doesnt record anything
[05:57] <lemonsCC> rogo: no
[05:57] <I_hate_spyware> evry thig is recored you just dont know it
[05:57] <lemonsCC> Madpilot: thanks for that info...news to me

[05:57] <dsnyders> Help!  I am getting E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) while installing Openssh
[05:57] <lemonsCC> I_hate_spyware: not by ubotu*
[05:57] <rogo> Thanks -I'm running 1.5 & it's cool..!
[05:57] <angel12> ok. so i got sick of how slow my computer was, and im just taking the chance with the bad stick of ram
[05:58] <Vermyndax> good evening
[05:58] <Vermyndax> could someone give me some partitioning advice?
[05:58] <rogo> Dans guardian is a bit strict though - had to re-config that.
[05:58] <lemonsCC> I_hate_spyware: thats ubuntulog's job =P
[05:58] <Vermyndax> setting up a new dapper server... have a 75gb and a 300gb drive
[05:58] <I_hate_spyware> i hada bad stick ram thoght liek you guess wat my 130$ computer wont trun on now :'(
[05:59] <frogzoo> Vermyndax: dapper? why not edgy?
[05:59] <root> lemonsCC::yippeeeeeeeeeeeeeee....its working now..i selected the vesa driver and it works just great ..my resolution is also jus fine..thanksssssssss
[05:59] <Vermyndax> frogzoo: I am migrating from a server that is running dapper
[05:59] <agee> ablyss:no im sure no icmp blocking in my network...
[05:59] <lemonsCC> root: OMG get out of root before all hell breaks loose!
[05:59] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, When the installer formats partions, it shows several mount points for those partions.  Consider having at least /home as a separate partition.
[05:59] <Vermyndax> frogzoo: thought about running edgy...
[05:59] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: would you put /home on the 300gb drive?
[05:59] <lemonsCC> root: and enjoy!
[05:59] <frogzoo> Vermyndax: actually, for a server LTS might be better
[06:00] <Vermyndax> frogzoo: yeah, and I've already got one server that is dapper, most items will be migrating from there
[06:00] <I_hate_spyware> im going to make a super computer one day
[06:00] <frogzoo> Vermyndax: for a server, seriously take a look at LVM & Software raid
[06:00] <Vermyndax> frogzoo: so would like the configs to be fully portable from one to the other
[06:00] <I_hate_spyware> i all redy ogt a program theat networks all the procesor together wow was it fast
[06:00] <agee> ablyss : no, im sure there is no icmp blocking in my network
[06:01] <agee> ablyss : no, im sure there is no icmp blocking in my network
[06:01] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, I recently lost a hard drive with critical data on it.  I would set up at least one backup partition for critical data.
[06:01] <lemonsCC> agee: what was the question?
[06:01] <Kurzweil> By any chance has anyone gotten beryl to work with an ati x1600?
[06:01] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: actually, the 300gb was going to hold a backup folder for all the servers on the network
[06:02] <zigford> dsnyders: Whats the problem with your dpkg command?
[06:02] <frogzoo> Vermyndax: for a server, I set /=500meg (overkill), /usr=10gig, /var= 2gig, depends if you're running www, mysql & other stuff, /home on separate part'n
[06:02] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: so I guess I'm just looking for ideas... was thinking to mount / on the 75gb drive, then 300gb for /home
[06:02] <agee> lemonsCC: my ubuntu cannot ping anywhere and im sure the network setting and parameters fine..it should work
[06:02] <root> exit
[06:02] <dsnyders> zigford, I'm not sure.  I'm trying to install sshd, and I get that error.
[06:02] <root> help
[06:02] <Vermyndax> frogzoo: it will be LAMP, postfix, squid, dns
[06:03] <frogzoo> Vermyndax: multiple partitions for /, /usr/, /var, /home at least
[06:03] <lemonsCC> agee:  ping inside the network or outside the network?
[06:03] <agee> lemonsCC: inside the network
[06:03] <minerale> Is it possible to increase the resolution of the default terminal in ubuntu? and I don't mean an X based terminal -- I mean just the traditional screen buffer - how can one increase the resolution on those ?
[06:03] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, It is a good idea for a server.  There are also other factors to consider.
[06:03] <frogzoo> Vermyndax: then you want to make sure /var will have ample space for www pages & mysql tables
[06:03] <lemonsCC> agee: install nmap and try that
[06:03] <rogo> agee: have you tried traceroute ?
[06:04] <lemonsCC> nmap -sP 192.168.0.0\24
[06:04] <asgilder> After doing an apt-get install buildessentials, ./configure isn't working.
[06:04] <jw_606> Hello
[06:04] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, If this is a web server, you also want to have a sizable /var folder for the website(s)
[06:04] <I_hate_spyware> :D my mac install finshed it works :D
[06:04] <jw_606> feryana?
[06:04] <agee> lemonsCC:ok ill try
[06:04] <lemonsCC> I_hate_spyware: gratz
[06:04] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: funny you should say that... I keep finding dapper installing stuff in /usr/share for websites
[06:04] <gotit> i wana paste some file in "filesystem/etc/speeedtouch/" why cant i , i copy it but paste is not enable
[06:04] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: should they *not* go there?
[06:04] <lemonsCC> agee: i think thats the command
[06:05] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, That is not the canonical place, no.
[06:05] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: I thought it was a little odd myself
[06:05] <I_hate_spyware> dose unatub support wireless ecrptsion my os 9 didnt
[06:05] <lemonsCC> gotit: shift +insert
[06:05] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, Are you sure it's the website folder going there, or is it just configuration data?
[06:05] <dreamer> I added a new user to kubuntu 6.10, and it says: could not start kstartupconfig
[06:05] <jw_606> I just installed Ubuntu 6.06 and it installed to the point where it says "remove cd to reboot and finish installing" I do that, my PC reboots then It goes thry the startup service check list then when it gets done with that my screen goes blank..i'm in recovery mode right now in the command prompt :(
[06:06] <jw_606> Please help
[06:06] <tonyyarusso> Can someone point me in the right direction for setting up a secure portion of a web site?  (Apache using SSL with username/password authentication)
[06:06] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: if you do apt-get install phpmyadmin, it puts phpmyadmin in /usr/share and symlinks it from /var/www
[06:06] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: same with phpldapadmin and anything else I seem to have installed via apt-get
[06:06] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, Ah.  Slightly different story there.
[06:06] <akk> jw_606: Do you have an older graphics card? That happens to me on my laptop because of dri.
[06:06] <frogzoo> when I mouseover menu items, gnome highlights the black to white which is hard to read, how do I change the highlight colour?
[06:06] <gotit> lemonsCC: than wat
[06:06] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: so I built a bunch of wordpress websites in /usr/share, etc.
[06:06] <lemonsCC> gotit: that is the key combo to paste in terminal
[06:07] <gotit> lemonsCC: it name appears in the box but its not pasted
[06:07] <akk> jw_606: I have to go in in cmdline mode and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and comment out the dri line.
[06:07] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: sounds like I made a mistake though ;)
[06:07] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, phpmyadmin is upgradeable software, so it properly belongs in /usr/share
[06:07] <ThePub> there a decent wm replacement under gnome that supports vertical and/or horizontal maximization?
[06:07] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, It is also web software, thus the symlinks
[06:07] <lemonsCC> gotit: ooo you need root access
[06:07] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: okie... so if I manually pulled down wordpress and built multiple wordpress sites, they should root in /var/www?
[06:07] <gotit> lemonsCC: how can i copy it from command prompt , i am root
[06:08] <tom47> what things are lodged in the ubuntu-proposed reposotory and what are the considerations of including or xcluding it?
[06:08] <jw_606> akk, what could i use to edit the xorg.conf file? Sorry I am a newbie
[06:08] <tom47> !ubuntu-proposed
[06:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuntu-proposed - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:08] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, yes, the sites should go in /var/www, and the software in /usr/share
[06:08] <akk> jw_606: Good question! I use vim, but there might be something easier installed (maybe someone else here knows)
[06:08] <lemonsCC> gotit: i am completely confused.... cp is the copy paste command in terminal (ex: sudo cp file.ext file.ext_backup)
[06:09] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: uhh... heh okie...
[06:09] <Kurzweil> Anyone know why when I use a xgl session for beryl my themes aren't working and windows open really slowly?
[06:09] <lemonsCC> akk + jw_606 nano is easiest IMHO
[06:09] <akk> jw_606: There are editors that are more newbie-friendly but I don't know what's installed by default.
[06:09] <jw_606> akk, so i could just "vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf"?
[06:09] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: I put multiple wordpress installs in there fresh
[06:09] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: okie, I'll build them "the right way" as I migrate stuff to the new server
[06:09] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, Thus, if you need to upgrade, you don't need to do any complex backup/restore.  Data in one folder, programs in another.
[06:09] <akk> Oh, right, use nano, jw_606 -- that'll be easier. nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:09] <lemonsCC> jw_606: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:10] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, ... and ideally each one in its own partition.
[06:10] <jw_606> akk, thank you! :)
[06:10] <akk> jw_606: look for the line that says Options: dri and either delete it or put a # at the beginning of the line
[06:10] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: makes sense for phpmyadmin, but for multiple wordpress sites it sounds like they should all go in /var/www
[06:10] <jw_606> i'll be back
[06:10] <gotit> lemonsCC: sorry if i am responsible for your confusion, but i just want to copy the file in i am not succeding,
[06:10] <jw_606> Oh btw how to I exit IRC from the recovery console?? :)
[06:10] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, I'm not familiar with wordpress.
[06:10] <lemonsCC> gotit: copy the file from folder a to b?
[06:10] <snype> how do i take a video of my screen like so i could show off my beryl to a buddy
[06:10] <Vermyndax> dsnyders: it's just your basic php application that has a mysql backend for blogging
[06:11] <dsnyders> Vermyndax, ... but I would let it install itself where it wants to.
[06:11] <agee> lemonsCC: is there other way beside nmaping...the instaler no included in CD, no network, no usbflash..it is impossible to install software
[06:11] <pradeep> Kurzweil, you could try asking at #ubuntu-xgl
[06:11] <lemonsCC> agee: tight situation...not sure

[06:12] <Art> No, my mobo does NOT have Legacy SATA
[06:12] <Art> Or anything of the sort
[06:12] <Art> Legacy USB yes
[06:12] <Arastoo> no copy the file from my memory stick to "file system/etc/speedtouch/ " which properties says i am not root , than i did , su ,enter my password i became root, but still not succeded
[06:12] <Arastoo> its me gotit
[06:12] <lemonsCC> gotit: sudo cp -R <file A> <file B> is the command to copy paste

[06:16] <Arastoo> lemonsCC: thats because the destination path is not knows

[06:17] <jw_606> I see that Ubuntu 6.06 doesnt have an IRC application? I had to run IRC from a terminal
[06:17] <agee> lemonsCC:what you expect for nmaping 192.168.0.0/24

[06:18] <QwertyM> jw_606, it does have XChat if I remember right

[06:19] <Prometheum> Hello, I just installed Ubuntu after using SuSe for a while. Is there anywhere outside a text file where I could switch the video card it uses from board-integrated to my graphics card (which is nvidia)?
[06:19] <bledy> Hi Ubuntus :) ! How can I make WLAN - LAN videoconference?
[06:19] <Arastoo> what does "shift+insert" mean
[06:20] <QwertyM> Arastoo, it means, paste.
[06:20] <TTT_Travis> what is that command that shows what ports are in use?
[06:20] <Arastoo> QwertyM:why cant i copy the file in the file system, its not coping it
[06:20] <roryy> TTT_Travis: 'netstat -t' or 'netstat -at' might be what you want (shows TCP ports)
[06:20] <QwertyM> em?
[06:21] <QwertyM> are there any other port types than tcp and udp? I'm a nub at networks :p
[06:21] <dsnyders> QwertyM, there are 65356 different ports under TCP/IP
[06:21] <I_hate_spyware> yah but it uses a dif protacal then tcp/ip
[06:22] <QwertyM> oh ok
[06:22] <Arastoo> why cant i copy the file in the file system
[06:22] <redcentre> anybody know anything about getting the Master Volume Control to actually act as a master volume control?
[06:22] <Arastoo> wat the heck is wrong with it
[06:22] <Arastoo> its not good
[06:22] <Prometheum> Does anyone know where I can change the graphics card from board-integrated to my other card?
[06:23] <dsnyders> QwertyM, If you cat /etc/services you will see a bunch of the standard ports and their protocols
[06:23] <akk> redcentre: The trick would be to keep apps from changing the PCM volume. Some apps seem to do that.
[06:23] <TTT_Travis> Prometheum in the BIOS usually
[06:23] <QwertyM> ok, i'll read up a little :)
[06:23] <Arastoo> i am trying to do it for a week and no body know shit about it
[06:23] <crimsun> redcentre: what's the real issue?
[06:23] <QwertyM> Arastoo, you want to copy what from where ?
[06:23] <dsnyders> Arastoo, cp /source/file /destination/file
[06:23] <Prometheum> travis: its in the bios for my bios, but once it gets to the OS it changes
[06:23] <Arastoo> aaaaaaah
[06:23] <Arastoo> dont say that dsnyders
[06:24] <Arastoo> do not
[06:24] <QwertyM> sudo cp /source/file /destination/file if the one by dsnyders dont work ?

[06:24] <bledy> Hi Ubuntus :) ! How can I make WLAN or LAN videoconference?
[06:24] <Arastoo> destination is filesystem/etc/speedtouch and source is admin/etc/speedtouch , can you write the comand , i bet you cant
[06:24] <dsnyders> burepe, fsdisk should be there
[06:25] <I_hate_spyware> my dog attacks my linux cds i odnt even label them
[06:25] <burepe> that has no gui right?
[06:25] <frogzoo> burepe: try gparted

[06:25] <burepe> thanks
[06:25] <QwertyM> :p
[06:25] <akk> Arastoo: filesystem/ and admin/ are directories under the current directory when you type the command?
[06:25] <redcentre> i had dapper installed once before and could control volume through PCM...was planning on changing the media keys on my keyboard to control the pcm volume...but this time after ive re-installed apper the only way that i can control sound at all is through the specific program i am using...Master, PCM, Speaker, etc do nothing
[06:25] <dsnyders> burepe, You could try cfdisk, which has an ascii gui

[06:26] <Arastoo> cp speedtouch330_firmware_3012.zip filesystem/etc/speedtouch, i am writing this when ia m in the source dir
[06:26] <akk> redcentre: I ended up writing my own python volume control script that always sets pcm to 100% then adjusts master.
[06:26] <redcentre> so how do i tell my apps to use master?

[06:28] <QwertyM> no need of putting that into the command !
[06:28] <Spaghetti_Knife> dsnyders ???

[06:29] <naut> I want to update ssh_host_dsa_key.pub and ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
[06:29] <I_hate_spyware> the ttermal oepned up by it self
[06:29] <naut> Is there a howto somewhere?
[06:29] <QwertyM> :o
[06:29] <agee> hi, can anybody help me with ubuntu networking...my ubuntu cannot ping to private network but im sure that all network setting and parameters in fine, no icmp blocking in my network, cable link is very well connected...please help
[06:29] <QwertyM> I_hate_spyware, its intuitive maybe :p
[06:29] <Prometheum> ablyss: My bios has the option, but ubuntu can only boot to my board-integrated otherwise my xserver crashes
[06:29] <bitmvnch> agee: how sure are you that all settings are fine? mind explaining how you set up your network? maybe you can pastebin the output of ifconfig?
[06:30] <I_hate_spyware> agee ever checked that the hardware is enabled?
[06:30] <dsnyders> Spaghetti_Knife, I have very little experience with wifi.  However your initial description of the problem sounded like a range issue.
[06:30] <Arastoo> in the tope menu place->homefolder-> than you can see some thing on the side of the opened folder cant you
[06:30] <ablyss> Prometheum: xserver crashes means you've successfully chaged video devices though
[06:30] <Prometheum> ablyss: So how can I celebrate my xserver crashes with a nice gui?
[06:31] <ablyss> Prometheum: so youre question should be how to keep xserver alive
[06:31] <Arastoo> why the hell cant i just paste it in the window, if i can copy it
[06:31] <agee> bitmvnch : ok..im thinking how to transfer ifconfig data to this internet connected computer...wait
[06:31] <rastilin> Because other people are using this screen for their conversations.
[06:31] <agee> I-hate_spyware : yes it is enabled
[06:31] <bitmvnch> agee: oh, duh, the perennial challenge of network configuration ;)
[06:32] <I_hate_spyware> arggh ghost ternamail keeps oepnig by its self
[06:32] <ablyss> Prometheum: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg in the command shell after xserver crashes, but remember this may render your working onboard video to an unworking state
[06:32] <Prometheum> ablyss: yes, I suppose so, but how can I use my far better pci card? I've used SuSe and YAST before, and I could do it there, is there anything like that on ubuntu and if so where?
[06:33] <feryana> jw606 i'm back
[06:33] <usr_rob> Nice, the HSF soft modem driver sound module made my sound work, hehe
[06:33] <agee> bitmvnch:..haha..yes..let me collect all network setting data
[06:33] <Arastoo> rastilin: HI please help,  i need to copy  a file in etc/speedtouch, which i am not able to , i can copy the file right clicking it, but the paste option is not enableed
[06:33] <bitmvnch> agee: try and describe as succinctly as possible, perhaps, what you've done so far to configure your network and why you are so sure the config is fine..
[06:33] <spx2> is anyone here into vim ?
[06:33] <rastilin> Arastoo, to where?
[06:33] <spx2> HELLO , anyone here into vim ?
[06:33] <bitmvnch> sometimes when trying to explain how you've done things right you'll remember something you should have done and answer your own question
[06:34] <I_hate_spyware> wats vim
[06:34] <Arastoo> rastilin: filesystem/etc/speedtouch
[06:34] <bitmvnch> spx2: whatcha need?
[06:34] <Terminus> spx2: lots of people are. i think. =)
[06:34] <rastilin> Arastoo, yeah, to where?
[06:34] <Prometheum> ablyss: there's no way to do it besides that? I may need to use my board integrated, though not for ubuntu
[06:34] <ablyss> Prometheum:  the "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg" command should run you through a video card setup for the xorg.conf file.. after that you can restart X
[06:34] <spx2> bitmvnch , Terminus i need to use vim as a C/C++ ide , i want to make something for it so that when i press a button it compiles my source
[06:34] <Arastoo> rastilin: filesystem/etc/speedtouch i want to copy it to it
[06:34] <jw_606> How do I change the default sound card? Its pointing to my integrated sound and not my Soundblaster live card
[06:34] <I_hate_spyware> wats the random take room?
[06:34] <rastilin> Arastoo, that makes no sense at all
[06:35] <I_hate_spyware> talk*'
[06:35] <Prometheum> ablyss: is there anything I can do with it on to change the card it uses from 0 to 1?
[06:35] <Terminus> spx2: hmmm... never modified keybindings before... i just do :!gcc -o foo foo.c
[06:35] <Arastoo> rastilin: why not
[06:35] <spx2> jw_606: see alsa configuration maybe ?
[06:35] <ablyss> Prometheum: if the onboard video is unworkable after that.. just reset bios to use onboard video and run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg" again
[06:35] <Arastoo> rastilin: i cant
[06:35] <rastilin> Arastoo, copy it to the same point. Why? What's the point?
[06:35] <rastilin> Arastoo, I can guess why though.
[06:35] <rastilin> Arastoo, you don't have permissions to write to /etc.
[06:35] <Arastoo> rastilin: source is my root
[06:36] <rastilin> Arastoo, ?
[06:36] <ablyss> Prometheum: someone else may have a better idea.. that would be my first try though
[06:36] <Arastoo> rastilin: i am root , why i am not permitted
=== selzy_imut is now known as ce_banget
[06:36] <Flannel> Arastoo: probably because you've got it mounted read only
[06:36] <rastilin> Root with a graphical prompt?
[06:36] <Arastoo> rastilin:i have to copy it from memory stick
[06:36] <Terminus> spx2: if you really want to modify keybindings, you might be better off in #vim. =)
[06:36] <agee> bitmvnch:ooooh...its weird..its working now..!:D i really dont understand...
[06:37] <spx2> Terminus: i'm there too
[06:37] <rastilin> Arastoo, ah? So, not /etc but from a memory stick, to where?
[06:37] <Arastoo> graphical prompt??
[06:37] <Prometheum> ablyss: how would I access xserver with it running on command line? I remember how to do it, I just was able to get to it easier on SUSE
[06:37] <Arastoo> rastilin: to filesystem/etc/speedtouch
[06:37] <carzzz215> does anyone know where network manager stores the saved SSIDs?  Sometimes it connects to certain networks and I don't want it to
[06:37] <Arastoo> rastilin: i told you already :)
[06:38] <rastilin> Arastoo, yeah because it makes lots of sense
[06:38] <rastilin> Arastoo, from the beginning then
[06:38] <Arastoo> rastlin: ok :-)
[06:38] <mista> is there any point to upgrading from 6.06 to 6.10?
[06:39] <Flannel> mista: new versions of stuff
[06:39] <Prometheum> ablyss: also, if I were installing most of the rpg's that came with edgy, would I experience what looked like a crash on the part of the package manager?
[06:39] <ablyss> Prometheum: I've seen software that edits the bios from the OS end.. but it's been so long i dont remember.. and to access X from the command you simply type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart or /etc/init.d/kdm restart ( kdm for kubuntu) ( gdm for ubuntu )
[06:39] <mista> yea but does it make a diff?
[06:39] <rastilin> mista, It makes a difference. It depends if it's worth the hassle for you.
[06:39] <Flannel> mista: just the fact that you get new versions.  It's entirely up to you whether it's "worth" it.
[06:40] <Flannel> mista: Is FF1.5 good enough for you?  is [whatever else vsomething]  good enough?
[06:40] <carzzz215> does anyone know where network manager stores the saved SSIDs?  Sometimes it connects to certain networks and I don't want it to
[06:40] <Arastoo> i had a file in my memory stick, which i copied to the root@admim-desktop:home/admim/etc/speedtouch and now i want to copy it in "filesystem/etc/speedtouch
[06:40] <Prometheum> ablyss: thanks, I'll be implementing that now. thanks for helping a noob!
[06:41] <rastilin> Arastoo, copy it in?
[06:41] <Arastoo> rastilin: the first etc/speedtouch i created it , the second one was already there
[06:41] <ablyss> Prometheum: the default package manager defaults to international repository.. which for would stall out and look like a crash maybe for those using synaptic.. enable repositories to use United State server fixes this
[06:41] <Arastoo> rastilin: in "filesystem/etc/speedtouch/
[06:42] <Jester45> is there any tools to customize a live cd? like pick what packages to incude and what not to
[06:42] <Arastoo> rastilin: from admim/etc/speedtouch
[06:43] <VonGuard> hello
[06:43] <Jester45> Hello
[06:43] <rastilin> Arastoo, still not following, can you discuss it with private messages?
[06:44] <Arastoo> rastilin: why not its simple
[06:44] <rastilin> Arastoo, it's not simple. It lacks a reason why. It's a completely new attempt and I still don't understand your system.

[06:45] <ubun> what's a good GUI mp3 player?
[06:45] <hicks> vlc
[06:45] <ubun> besids vlc and xmms (dont really like them)
[06:46] <ubun> for mp3s
[06:46] <rastilin> mplayer works fine
[06:46] <hicks> hmm
[06:46] <ubun> im used to foobar2000 from windows
[06:46] <ablyss> good as in simple or good as in powerful w/ many options
[06:46] <Jester45> Flannel: yes i have looked at that page but im looking for a tool...um more automated i give it the iso and check/uncheck what packages to have
[06:46] <ubun> both, like foobar2000 :)
[06:46] <hicks> yea you mean like a libary mp3 player?
[06:46] <wastrel> Ubunto
[06:46] <ubun> kinda, with good playlists and 'light' interface
[06:46] <mista> any good docs on how to install xgl/berly onto drapper
[06:46] <hicks> amarok is good but its in qt
[06:47] <Flannel> Jester45: then no, there is no tool.  If you're looking for a liveCD based linux (which Ubuntu primarily isn't) to carry around with you and use regularly, there are more appropriate ones out there.
[06:47] <ubun> what's wrong with qt?
[06:47] <ablyss> xmms is pretty straight forward and light..
[06:47] <Flannel> mista: #ubuntu-xgl can help
[06:47] <Music_Shuffle1> Knoppix is nice for LiveCD based distros.
[06:47] <hicks> installing kdebase takes a bit of space
[06:47] <hicks> i dont mind qt :D
[06:47] <hicks> just a gnome guy
[06:48] <Jester45> Flannel: no im going to be installing ubuntu on many computer but they arnt on lan so i might just take a regualr cd + flash drive with debs and a script
[06:48] <ablyss> i'm using kmplayer to do most of my media playing now sort of medium.. not too light not too heavy
[06:49] <Flannel> Jester45: ah.  You might be more interested in the Alternate CD then (the second link).  Doesn't require booting to a live environment first (start the installer right away), and is a lot easier to customize
[06:49] <hicks> yea kmplayer is not bad
[06:49] <jw_606> Hm, I can't get my sound to work, it appears that my soundcard is working, when I test system sounds they work fine, but when I try to view videos or MP3's no sound?
[06:49] <rastilin> You need codecs
[06:49] <hicks> yea do you have codecs installed?
[06:49] <Jester45> hicks: ubun:  i use amarok becuase it looks good and has as many options as you could want
[06:49] <carzzz215> does anyone know where network manager stores the saved SSIDs?  Sometimes it connects to certain networks and I don't want it to
[06:49] <Flannel> !codecs | jw_606
[06:49] <ubotu> jw_606: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[06:49] <jw_606> My volume in the upper right hand corner doesn't "ding" when I click on it either?
[06:50] <hicks> yea amarok is good just you need to install kdebase before using it on standred ubuntu
[06:50] <Flannel> carzzz215: not I, however you might try looking in your home folder, if it's not there (which I imagine it will be) you might try somewhere in /etc
[06:50] <carzzz215> Flannel, ok...i'll check that out...thanks :)
[06:50] <hicks> i dont think volume in gnome dings...
[06:50] <jw_606> Google video's dont have sound either :(
[06:50] <Jester45> Flannel: i might look into the alternative cd
[06:51] <hicks> oh thats wierd
[06:51] <hicks> whats your sound card?
[06:51] <wastrel> carzzz215:  might be somewhere under ~/.config/
[06:51] <jw_606> Sound Blaster Live Valuer
[06:51] <jw_606> Value*
[06:51] <Flannel> carzzz215: make sure you show hidden files though, it'll definately be hidden.  (that means a . in front of the name), it may be just a file, but more likely a folder, with appropriate files in it
[06:51] <Oni-Dracula> do ATI drivers exist for Linux/Ubuntu?
[06:51] <hicks> try typing "  modprobe sb  " in console
[06:51] <dsnyders> Help!  I am getting E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) while installing Openssh
[06:51] <hicks> yes onidracula ill give you the link to a tutorial
[06:51] <Flannel> !ati | Oni-Dracula
[06:51] <ubotu> Oni-Dracula: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:51] <carzzz215> Flannel, ok
[06:52] <ablyss> vlc is amazing though.. being able to broadcast audio/video over LAN and watch it in perfect clarity is a vlc highlight
[06:52] <jw_606> hicks I get errors :)
[06:52] <hicks> lol hmmm
[06:52] <Oni-Dracula> lazy bot user :p
[06:52] <hicks> k ill brb after google searchs
[06:52] <Jester45> ablyss: or use a ftp server
[06:53] <Jester45> hicks: try www.google.com/linux
[06:53] <hicks> ty jester i never thought of that
[06:53] <Oni-Dracula> ok so ATI driver support looks good, does anyone have any thoughts as to why one shouldn't use an IBM/Lenovo laptop for Ubuntu usage?
[06:53] <hicks> http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide   Oni=Dracula
[06:53] <ablyss> Jester45: or use a ftp server? in regards to what?
[06:54] <ubun> i installed amarok but im not hearin any playback when i try to play mp3s, i have all the codecs installed to play mp3s i thought
[06:54] <Jester45> ablyss: instead of vlc broadcasting
[06:54] <AngryElf> is edgy still using /dev/dsp by default?
[06:54] <Jester45> ubun does any sound work on your system
[06:55] <ubun> yes
[06:55] <ubun> i can hear mp3s with mpg321 and vlc
[06:55] <Jester45> volume up?
[06:55] <ubun> yes
[06:55] <dabaR> ubun: check for libxine-extracodecs
[06:55] <dabaR> AngryElf: afaik yes
[06:55] <mista> do i need to install this ? "E: Couldn't find package linux-dri-modules-2.6.15-27-386"
[06:55] <dabaR> and idk much
[06:56] <dabaR> mista: what gives you that error?
[06:56] <levander> I just install linux-source-2.6.17, but I'm getting some error about no "Module.symvers" file found when I'm trying to compile a module for my network card.  Anyone know where to find a package with Module.symvers in it?
=== Jester45 is now known as Jester45_afk
[06:57] <wastrel> levander:  use apt-file to search for what packages provide a file
[06:57] <mista> trying to install "sudo apt-get install linux-dri-modules-common linux-dri-modules-`uname -r` xserver-xorg-air-core" - "install the AIGLX X Server"
[06:57] <crimsun> levander: they're in linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[06:57] <ubun> dabaR:  thanks that worked
[06:57] <ablyss> Jester45: by writing a script or something that reads the content of /dev/video I suppose... but you still might need vlc to read the signal from the client OS
[06:57] <dabaR> ubun: always does
[06:57] <levander> crimsun: that's the problem, i installed linux-source, but not the linux-headers, never thought I would need them both, damn
[06:58] <levander> crimsun: thanks
[06:58] <nothlit> you don't need linux-source for beryl
[06:58] <crimsun> you normally don't need l-s, either.
[06:58] <hicks> jw_606: how old is that sound card?
[06:58] <hicks> im finding nothing on google
[06:59] <Jester45_afk> ablyss: no just open a ftp client and transfer the file
[06:59] <Jester45_afk> Hello crimsun
[06:59] <crimsun> jw_606: pastebin the following output: ``asoundconf && amixer''
[06:59] <mista> why updates trying to instal ati and intel video drivers when i have nvidia card!!!!
[06:59] <ubun> amarok seems more like foobar2000 and xmms is more like winamp. amarok ftw
[06:59] <crimsun> jw_606: sorry, ``asoundconf list && amixer''
[06:59] <dabaR> mista: maybe linux-restricted, there is no -dri in ubuntu, which tutorial are you following? /j #ubuntu-xgl usually for gl help
[06:59] <Jester45_afk> ubun: yes ftw
[07:00] <race> hows it going
[07:00] <mista> im following this one "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/AIGLXOnDapper"

[07:00] <jw_606> crimsun, ok I ran that in a terminal :)
[07:00] <crimsun> jw_606: yes, but you need to pastebin it so that we can help
[07:00] <jw_606> 1 sec
[07:00] <dabaR> mista: did you sudo aptitude update, and added the extra repos before that?
[07:00] <mista> yes
[07:00] <lcandell> this is a picture for the howto on installing ubuntu on the ps3 - say cheese!
[07:01] <jw_606> pastebin.com is acting slow, is there another paste bin?
[07:01] <dsnyders> dabaR, Extra repos?  What extra repos?
[07:01] <crimsun> jw_606: choose one of the hundred others
[07:01] <ablyss> Jester45_afk: that woudl work but after time the file would accumlate to be large enough to eat up your entire hard drive space.  vlc just sends the data w/ out writting to disk, over then LAN where the client pc doesn't have to download a file, but simply connects to the host IP
[07:01] <mista> "deb http://ubuntu.compiz.net/ dapper main aiglx" did not work!
[07:01] <dabaR> dsnyders: as shown on the tutorial that he is following

[07:07] <niko_m>  hello i just downloaded ubuntu the newest version i burned it to cd and booted from it.  it shows my new external usb drive but doesn't show my regular ntfs hard drive with two ntfs partitions
[07:07] <niko_m> <niko_m> it also doesn't show my cd burner and dvd drive and doesn' allow me to mount them
[07:07] <niko_m> <niko_m> it doesn't allow me to access my windows hard or mount it either
[07:07] <niko_m> <niko_m> the only drive it allows me to access is my external usb hard drive which is ntfs also
[07:07] <niko_m> <niko_m> also i'm thinking of installing it to my hard drive i noticed there is a program on the live cd that is for resizing paritions does it do it without destroying data?
[07:07] <niko_m> <niko_m> where can i read about how much space i will need for ubuntu
[07:07] <niko_m> <niko_m> can someone tell me how much space i need to install for ubuntu for a basic desktop install
[07:07] <niko_m> <niko_m> can i run it off a external usb harddrive ?

[07:07] <AB3I> evening all. I've got an emergency question. I'm flying out in about 8 hours and need to format a disk so I can take some data with me. I'm still a noob with the terminal, and qtparted wont let me format the drive mounted as the slave (currently ntfs) as fat32. Can someone just show me the command string real quick to make it all into one fat32 partitino?

[07:10] <JoePits> it didnt do it
[07:10] <JoePits> not one of the 4
[07:10] <ubun> dabaR thats what i thought but when i try to go to /dev/hda1 with mplayer it's not there
[07:10] <dabaR> JoePits: look at the private message from ubotu, it has a link to read

[07:14] <dabaR> gotit: you could gksudo nautilus, but make sure you close the gui windows right after you are done your task, so you do not have a dangerous window around
[07:14] <jw_606> crimsun,  Shockwave Flash 7.0 r68
[07:15] <crimsun> jw_606: please enable dapper-backports and upgrade it to 9 beta 2
[07:15] <rajiv_nair> ken: no idea sorry:)
[07:15] <rajiv_nair> ken: im pretty new to linux in general........
[07:15] <carzzz215> dabaR, hey, i think your right, but it's not erasing...i trying "sudo rmdir -rf /usr/share/example-content" and its saying "-r" even though i did "-rf" is an invalid option
[07:15] <dabaR> crimsun: sound works somewhat better with that flash?
[07:15] <crimsun> dabaR: much better
[07:15] <kenThomson> Can't ANYONE tell me how do i get ubuntu to boot?
[07:15] <crimsun> dabaR: [as in it actually works] 
[07:15] <dabaR> carzzz215: sudo rm -rf it deletes.
[07:15] <madman91> can i install a flash 32 bit ... standalone player ?
[07:15] <wastrel> kenThomson:  you can create a boot disk
[07:15] <dabaR> crimsun: sweet, I think I know how to fix an old issue then...
[07:16] <madman91> to play an old game
[07:16] <wastrel> kenThomson:  do you have a floppy drive?
[07:16] <dabaR> kenThomson: ubotu did.
[07:16] <kenThomson> wastrel: I dont want to risk loosing it.
[07:16] <kenThomson> dabaR: but those links don't answer my specific questions
[07:16] <kenThomson> dabaR: Did you read my question?
[07:16] <dabaR> kenThomson: yes
[07:16] <wastrel> kenThomson:  you can install grub on a removable disk and boot with that by putting the disk in the drive
[07:16] <kenThomson> dabaR: so...?
[07:16] <spx2> wastrel: is  [[ supposed to work in vim ?
[07:17] <spx2> ANYONE , HOW DOES [[ OR ] ]  WORK IN VIM ?
[07:17] <dabaR> kenThomson: so ymmv, it works here.
[07:17] <kenThomson> wastrel: As i told you, i dont want to risk loosing it
[07:17] <kenThomson> dabaR: What should i do, now?
[07:17] <wastrel> kenThomson:  losing the boot disk you mean?  i thought you meant losing your MBR
[07:17] <crimsun> spx2: some context would be nice.
[07:17] <niko_m19> hi i was just in here but i was using xp so i booted with the live cd of ubuntu the newest version of the desktop cd
[07:17] <crimsun> spx2: i.e., what are you attempting?
[07:17] <carzzz215> dabaR, hey thanks that worked!...why did that work and not rmdir?
[07:17] <wastrel> spx2:  i don't know
[07:17] <spx2> crimsun: i read in this vim for c programmers
[07:17] <JoePits> how do i make little icons on my desktop for my drives i mounted
[07:18] <JoePits> ohhh create launcher?
[07:18] <spx2> wastrel crimsun it says there that i should use [[ to get to the next "{" in my source
[07:18] <wastrel> spx2:  seems to work for me.
[07:18] <dabaR> carzzz215: rmdir removes dirs, if they are empty. rm deletes file nodes, and rm -r deletes a whole branch if you think of the file system as a tree
[07:18] <spx2> wastrel: like what does it do ?
[07:18] <wastrel> spx2:  yes, i just tested it-  you may need  vim-full   edgy comes with vim-tiny by default.
[07:18] <wastrel> spx2:  it jumps to the first { or the top of the file.
[07:18] <niko_m19> my problem was ubuntu is only finding my external usb hard drive not my main hard drive that is ntfs also that has two partitions on it
[07:18] <carzzz215> dabaR, ahh ok...thanks
[07:18] <dabaR> JoePits: depends on where you mounted them, it should have icons already for files in /media.
[07:19] <dabaR> !icons > JoePits
[07:19] <JoePits> ya but i want shortcuts
[07:19] <kenThomson> hell!
[07:19] <niko_m19> when i do sudo fdisk -l it show all the paritions
[07:19] <dabaR> niko_m19: then you just have to mount them.
[07:19] <dabaR> !mountwindows > niko_m19
[07:19] <spx2> wastrel: i have vim full too lemme try ok ?
[07:19] <niko_m19> i tried that it doesn't work
[07:19] <JoePits> whats gconfeditor
[07:20] <dabaR> JoePits: it is a program... gconf-editor
[07:20] <JoePits> ok i figured it out
[07:20] <JoePits> typed that in terminal
[07:20] <spx2> wastrel: its ok it works
[07:20] <dabaR> niko_m19: show output of sudo fdisk -l on paste.ubuntubrasil.org
[07:20] <niko_m19> when i type sudo !mountwindows it says event not found
[07:20] <soulfreshner> anybody here have problems with midi?
[07:21] <soulfreshner> I can't seem to get it to work
[07:21] <dabaR> niko_m19: it is a command for the channel bot to send you a pm
[07:21] <soulfreshner> no errors or anything, just no sound
[07:21] <dabaR> soulfreshner: what have you tried to fix it?
[07:21] <dcnstrct> hi.  I'm a noob.  Just installed dapper drake server.  Now I want to install some stuff with apt-get but when I use apt-get install whatver-program-name then it asks me for my CD.  I don't want to get packages from the CD I want to get them from the net.  What should I do ?
[07:22] <dabaR> dcnstrct: sudo <editor> /etc/apt/sources.list remove the cd line
[07:22] <gephalt> how do i get information about the hardware on my computer- other than lspci/lsusb. the processor specs- particularly
[07:22] <madman91> 64BIT dapper.... 32bit flash game... 32bit swiftfox browser... 32bit flash plugin ... HOW CAN i play that game ? without a browser.. in windows i would double click.. does linux have a stand alone player? how can i play it?
[07:22] <dabaR> gephalt: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[07:22] <dabaR> gephalt: lshw
[07:22] <wastrel> dcnstrct:  you need to edit your apt sources & comment out the CD lines.  /etc/apt/sources.list  make sure the http lines are uncommented
[07:22] <dcnstrct> gephalt, proc filesystem has lots of useful info.
[07:22] <rajiv_nair> madman: tried opening it in the browser??:)
[07:23] <madman91> rajiv_nair: yea.. it just shows a download dialog
[07:23] <niko_m19> that link is in brazil
[07:23] <soulfreshner> dabaR: fix it how?
[07:23] <rajiv_nair> ohhh
[07:23] <niko_m19> how am i suppose to send
[07:23] <madman91> rajiv_nair: browser will player .swf .. not a file ..
[07:23] <dabaR> !mountwindows | niko_m19
[07:23] <ubotu> niko_m19: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[07:23] <rajiv_nair> oh yeah
[07:23] <soulfreshner> I tried looking in the standard places - lsmod to see if the drivers are loaded
[07:23] <gotit> i cant enter in the directory which i can see by typing ls
[07:23] <dcnstrct> wastrel, that worked, thats alot
[07:24] <gephalt> thank you dabaR. I am asking cause when ever i use an application like k3b/sound-juicer my computer seems to freeze up. Its an old machine- but not quite old- pentiumIV proc (1.8Ghz) with 256 ram and an nvidia geforce4. I run fluxbox most of the time. yet the results are the same. could there be anything else that might be affecting the performance? am using ubuntu 6.10 freshly installed
[07:24] <soulfreshner> everything seems fine, and all other sound works
[07:24] <dabaR> gephalt: processor usage - top
[07:24] <dabaR> gotit: sudo ls?
[07:24] <madman91> rajiv_nair: any other ideas?
[07:25] <gotit> dabaR: dont know
[07:25] <dabaR> gotit: does sudo ls give any better results than ls?
[07:25] <gotit> dabaR: no, just the colors
[07:25] <niko_m19> i tried typing !mountwindows dabar that doesn't do anything
[07:26] <niko_m19> i'm looking at the help file now
[07:26] <dabaR> niko_m19: follow the instructions in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[07:26] <VigoFusio1> Greetings
[07:26] <dabaR> gotit: you can not get into that dir with the gui?
[07:27] <jw_606> crimsun, I got my sound working, seems fine now, thank you so much !: )
[07:27] <gotit> dabaR:i can but i have to run the file
[07:27] <niko_m19> another question i had is if the gnome partition editor resizes windows partitions without destroying data?
[07:27] <soulfreshner> what is supposed to happen when I run timidity from the command line?
[07:27] <dabaR> gotit: What is the dir, what is the file?
[07:27] <crimsun> jw_606: np
[07:27] <soulfreshner> 'cos at the moment it does nothing
[07:28] <niko_m19> and what kind of space do you need for ubuntu for a simple hard drive install and does the setup take care of making the linux partitions it needs for that and the swap drive and all of that?
[07:28] <tonyyarusso> niko_m19: About 3 g is the safe minimum, I'd go 5 or 6, and yes.
[07:28] <Menisk> i need to connect to the internet through my usb connection to my router which my adsl modem is plugged into, i've tried pppoeconf and need help how should i connect the net and don't ask ubotu for adsl instruction because that gives you pppoeconf
[07:28] <EDinNY> I installed kubuntu...it has make, but the closest I found to gcc was /usr/bin/gcc-4.1.  did it forget to put a link from gcc=>gcc-4.1?
[07:28] <VigoFusio1> niko_m19: 10g is plenty, and it will make a swap and everything
[07:28] <gotit> in /speedtouchconf-27-jun-2006 file is speedtouchcon.ch
[07:28] <dabaR> niko_m19: that is its purpose to resize without destroying data. As always, with data, make backups, but it should work. 5gb for a minimal install, if you can spare 10, even better,.
[07:29] <dabaR> EDinNY: you should install the build-essential package if you want to compile
[07:29] <VigoFusio1> niko_m19: 3-5g is all thats really needed
[07:29] <dabaR> gotit: change some permissions on that dir. chmod changes permissions, it has a nice man page, chmod does.
[07:29] <VigoFusio1> niko_m19: I did 10g cause I had 30g free space
[07:30] <EDinNY> thanks
[07:30] <XiXaQ> hmm, I have a public_html folder in my home. However, when I add new files, I must manually change permissions for them. How can I fix this?
[07:30] <niko_m19> what about installing to a 320 gig external usb drive
[07:30] <dabaR> XiXaQ: what does umask in a temrinal show?
[07:31] <niko_m19> can i run linux from that drive
[07:31] <XiXaQ> dabaR?
[07:31] <niko_m19> is that possible
[07:31] <niko_m19> currently that is the only drive i can access on my live cd right now
[07:31] <dabaR> XiXaQ: run umask in a terminal and tell us what it showed you
[07:31] <XiXaQ> dabaR, on the public_html directory, or what?
[07:31] <VigoFusio1> niko_m19: Yes you can, but there have been issues with USB Externals, they might be resolved.
[07:32] <XiXaQ> dabaR, umask alone shows 0022
[07:32] <dabaR> XiXaQ: just type umask when you get to a command prompt
[07:32] <niko_m19> how would i be able to boot from it?
[07:32] <dabaR> XiXaQ: then all files you create will have 644 permissions if they are text files.
[07:32] <dabaR> XiXaQ: what exactly do you do now?
[07:32] <Menisk> i need to connect to the internet through my usb connection to my router which my adsl modem is plugged into, i've tried pppoeconf and need help how should i connect the net and don't ask ubotu for adsl instruction because that gives you pppoeconf and this setup works fine in windows
[07:33] <VigoFusio1> niko_m19: In the BIOS you would or could make changes there, just like any Hardware Device
[07:34] <XiXaQ> dabaR, I copy a file into the public_html directory, then I open nautilus, rightclick public_html, properties, select permissions, grant others the right to read the files and apply permissions to enclosed files.
[07:34] <niko_m19> well do i have to resize my windows parition to make room to make a linux partition before setup or will that be a part of the setup process?
=== capunk is now known as ce_smp_cr
[07:34] <dabaR> XiXaQ: and where do you copy the file from and how do you create it?
[07:35] <XiXaQ> dabaR, I copy the file from elsewhere. Either my home-dir, another drive, email account..
[07:35] <VigoFusio1> niko_m19: That is part of the gpart utility, it allocates Free space
[07:35] <niko_m19> is that part of setup though?
[07:35] <niko_m19> will it run gpart?
[07:35] <VigoFusio1> Correct
[07:35] <gotit> is there any other command for changing the dir
[07:35] <XiXaQ> gotit, changing working directory?
[07:36] <dabaR> XiXaQ: it seems to me that when you create a file in a terminal it has fine permissions for readability. maybe your other way of creating files is the one to blame...
[07:36] <XiXaQ> dabaR, creating files? Rightclick, copy, paste?
[07:37] <niko_m19> is gpart as reliable a program as acronis parition manager?
[07:37] <VigoFusio1> niko_m19: There are a few sights that show the step by step, the gpart/Prtition cimes in near the end of install.
[07:37] <ESPOiG> wats a good way to kill gdm cuz i try to kill it with killall gdm and it fails and says it cant
[07:37] <dabaR> XiXaQ: a paste never created a file, did it?
[07:37] <dabaR> ESPOiG: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
[07:37] <XiXaQ> dabaR, that's what _I'm_ talking about...
[07:38] <VigoFusio1> gpart is vailable as a standolone application, but it is included with the Distro
[07:38] <dabaR> gparted
[07:38] <XiXaQ> dabaR, I think the problem is with apache...
[07:38] <ESPOiG> dabaR, thankyou
[07:39] <Menisk> i need to connect to the internet through my usb connection to my router which my adsl modem is plugged into, i've tried pppoeconf and need help how should i connect the net and don't ask ubotu for adsl instruction because that gives you pppoeconf and this setup works fine in windows

[07:43] <EDinNY> has anyone use "audiocd:/" in konqurer to rip an audio cd?
[07:43] <niko_m19> they are ntfs

[07:44] <dabaR> JoePits: does your X work without it?
[07:44] <race> JJoepits: Yes
[07:44] <JoePits> ya but i wanna play games
[07:44] <niko_m19> even my usb drive its ntfs too?
[07:44] <niko_m19> what if they were fat32 could i write to them then?
[07:44] <snype> yep
[07:44] <WOOHOO> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=315904
[07:44] <dabaR> niko_m19: or vfat something like that, I do not know readlly
[07:45] <niko_m19> snype so if i formateed my usb external hard drive back to fat 32 i could write to it in ubuntu?
[07:46] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, you can download ntfs-3g if you need to write to them.
[07:46] <WOOHOO> ubuntu gaming gotta go up now just saw this post http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=315904
[07:46] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, it's not perfect and you don't get any guarantees, but I haven't heard of anyone who has had any problems with it.
[07:46] <XiXaQ> !ntfs
[07:46] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[07:47] <WOOHOO> !gaming
[07:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gaming - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:47] <XiXaQ> !ntfs-3g | niko_m19
[07:47] <niko_m19> what is the name of that one program because when i ran the script it said i could run something that would allow me to write but it didn't reccomend it because it didnt' work to good
[07:47] <ubotu> niko_m19: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[07:47] <dabaR> does it come in packets of five?
[07:47] <niko_m19> yeah that's what i though
[07:47] <niko_m19> thought
[07:48] <niko_m19> so the same thing with writing to ntfs partitions even when you install ubuntu to the hard drive
[07:48] <kuto> hi
[07:48] <dabaR> yes
[07:48] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, read the url you got from ubotu.
[07:48] <niko_m19> so it would probably be better to have my external hard drive be fat 32 i should have left it that way isntead of formatting it to ntfs
[07:48] <dabaR> niko_m19: seems so
[07:49] <niko_m19> i will
[07:49] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, if you can, you should probably use fat 16.
[07:49] <kuto> can someone help? I am running a laptop and when i cat /proc/cpuinfo my cpu says that it is just running at 1000MHz it is actually at 1.6GHz+
[07:49] <vaibhav> hey all
[07:49] <kuto> how do i fix this
[07:49] <VigoFusio1> Was I messing up?
[07:49] <niko_m19> i don't think i can use that for my external hard drive
[07:49] <XiXaQ> kuto, could it be cool and quiet?
[07:49] <VigoFusio1> =-O
[07:49] <nothlit> kuto, thats fine, laptops have cpu scaling
[07:49] <ademan> how is nforce mobo support in edgy?
[07:49] <XiXaQ> kuto, there is a applet for the panel which let you see and adjust the cpu speeds.
[07:50] <wastrel> kuto:  do something processor-intensive and it'll spike up to max
[07:50] <kuto> what is the applet?
[07:50] <wastrel> calculate pi or something.
[07:50] <XiXaQ> kuto, look around.
[07:50] <vaibhav> hey i got a gpg error while updating apt-get does anyone knows y does it occur?
[07:50] <XiXaQ> kuto, however, cpu scaling is a good thing.
[07:50] <kuto> everything seems to run at the right speed but the cpu is not just running at it though
[07:51] <niko_m19> so is installing easy if you have installed linux before?
[07:51] <cafuego_> ademan: my nforce3 works fione (has for years) dunno about nforce4 or 6100
[07:51] <niko_m19> i don't want to wreck my system
[07:51] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, heh, installing ubuntu is easy. Period.
[07:51] <dabaR> vaibhav: show us the error, and your sources.list file on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:51] <vaibhav> ok wait
[07:51] <niko_m19> i usually do my partitioning first
[07:51] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, do you have free space on your harddrive?
[07:51] <cafuego_> kuto: cpu frequency applet, it's in the default install.
[07:51] <ademan> cafuego: unfortunately this is nforce4
[07:51] <vaibhav> GPG error: http://non-us.debian.org stable/non-US Release: The following sign atures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F 1D53D8C4F368D5D
[07:52] <cafuego_> ademan: That should be well supported, it's over 12 years old now.
[07:52] <kuto> cafuego, cpu frequency applet is not installed in my edgy
[07:52] <dabaR> vaibhav: comment out the debian.org repository in your /etc/apt/sources.list file.
[07:52] <cafuego_> CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor 2.16.1
[07:52] <niko_m19> i have 26 gigs free on my hard drive on its extended partition that is ntfs
[07:52] <VigoFusio1> My install got goofed up, well operator error, but anyhoot, can a layover install repair it? or is there some other way?
[07:52] <vaibhav> but y does it occur?
[07:53] <niko_m19> its 44 gigs total
[07:53] <dabaR> vaibhav: cause you have a repository n your list, and do not have a gpg key for it.
[07:53] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, free unpartitioned space, I meant.
[07:53] <niko_m19> my first partition my primary one is 12 gigs with windows on it and some programs and i have 3 gigs free on that
[07:53] <vaibhav> how do fix it besides commenting?
[07:53] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, I would not trust the installer to resize ntfs partitions if I were you.
[07:54] <cafuego_> ademan: I'd be highly surprised if it didn't work (I'm pretty (but not 100%)) sure I plonked dapper on an nforce4 S939 board at a friends place a few months ago.
[07:54] <nothlit> gparted is great at resizing ntfs
[07:54] <dabaR> vaibhav: why do you have a debian repository if you use ubuntu?
[07:54] <niko_m19> and i have 295 gigs free on my usb external hard drive but they are all ntfs drives
[07:54] <niko_m19> should i use acronis partition manager?
[07:54] <niko_m19> i have that with a program i downloaded off the net called hirens boot cd
[07:54] <ademan> by the way i heard numerous reports that amd64+edgy=fail, is that true?
[07:54] <mural1> hi all
[07:55] <niko_m19> i actually has several partition managers
[07:55] <cafuego_> ademan: The amd64 desktop install I did last month worked fine
[07:55] <cafuego_> ademan: Just don't expect video codecs, flash or java applets to work
[07:55] <ademan> ok, i'm trying to help someone with an amd64 dual core....
[07:56] <mural1> how do i install audio and video players like xine and kaffeine ??
[07:56] <ademan> they won't work at all? I thought amd64 could run x86 binaries just fine...
[07:56] <niko_m19> so one person says i should gpart to resize the other person says i shouldn't
[07:56] <dabaR> !synaptic > mural
[07:56] <ademan> niko_m19: gparted is your friend
[07:56] <niko_m19> well the good thing is the partition with all the free space on it doesn't have anything i need on it
[07:56] <_Enchained> niko_m19: there's a tool to prepare your drive in the installation process so you can use it to format etc
[07:56] <XiXaQ> niko_m19, never make such radical changes to your system without having a backup.
[07:56] <dabaR> ! synaptic > mural1
[07:56] <niko_m19> its my primary partion that has widows on it and the few programs i use
[07:57] <_Enchained> you must defrag the part before
[07:57] <kuto> if i install kubuntu desktop it changes my boot splash how do i change it back to ubuntu splash?
[07:57] <_Enchained> to be sure that you won't loose data
[07:57] <niko_m19> the main thing i wanted to backup was windows with my new external hard drive but i found out you can't back that up with the backup software the comes with the driver.  not so you can just restore it
[07:57] <VigoFusio1> !Synaptic
[07:57] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[07:57] <cafuego_> ademan: it runs 'em, but it involves annoying hassle.
[07:57] <niko_m19> i did use acronis image to make an image of my drive

[08:27] <wyld> "The file should be owned by root.root and be copied to /tmp." This is what it says in the java installer relating to the documentation. how do i do this?
[08:27] <SilentDis> wyld:  sudo chown root:root /target/file.name
[08:28] <kishan> dabaR: any help will be appreciated
[08:28] <ademan> Turner: oh, the alternate installer is a separate cd
[08:28] <Turner> wth!
[08:28] <Turner> brilliant.
[08:28] <wyld> SilentDis: do i have colon in root:root, or a period?
[08:29] <Realmy> Does anybody know if the 'generic' kernel is 686 optimized, or is it 386?
[08:29] <SilentDis> wyld:  that's a colon :)
[08:29] <gotit> help me God, help me guys for God sake
[08:29] <Realmy> my friend's laptop is a P4 celeron, so I'd like to run a 686 kernel, if possible:)
[08:29] <wyld> SilentDis: thanks
[08:30] <SilentDis> realmy:  with edgy, they've gone away from the whole 'optimized' kernel thing...  it's now one kernel to rule them all.... or you can self-compile ;)
[08:30] <Realmy> output from uname -rm: 2.6.17-10-generic i686
[08:30] <nothlit> !alternate | Turner
[08:30] <ubotu> Turner: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[08:30] <SilentDis> wyld:  nt :)
[08:30] <dabaR> wyld: are you installing Java?
[08:30] <Realmy> SilentDis, ah, so everythings 386 then
[08:30] <gotit> i cannot enter into the directiores
[08:30] <gotit> i can see them with ls
[08:31] <ademan> is there a list of liveCd "cheat codes" somewhere?
[08:31] <wyld> dabaR:yes
[08:31] <SilentDis> realmy:  not really...
[08:31] <Realmy> SilentDis, for self-compiled, is there a good way to get ubuntu's hardware detection, or is it a ground up 'make menuconfig' type of affair?
[08:31] <dabaR> wyld: there is an ubuntu package of java now.
[08:31] <nothlit> !java | wyld
[08:31] <ubotu> wyld: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:31] <SilentDis> realmy:  supposedly, it tries to use the 'best' for your kernel... but yeah, a lot is just base i386 code.  as i said, if you want optimized, you'll have to compile your own kernel.
[08:32] <kaveh> hello everybody
[08:32] <dabaR> kishan: it may be that your config file sucks. Try sudo apt-get remove --purge samba;sudo apt-get install --reinstall samba
[08:32] <gotit> dabaR: can you plz help, i cant enter in the dir
[08:32] <wyld> I could have found that, but I'm trying to learn linux here ;)
[08:32] <J-_> will
[08:32] <Realmy> SilentDis, yeah, that's what I was afraid of- i'm trying to squeeze some extra kick out a friend's celeron, but she's not too tech savvy :-/
[08:32] <J-_> err
[08:32] <dabaR> wyld: fair enough...
[08:32] <SilentDis> realmy:  i've yet to hand compile for ubuntu... last time I did it was about a year ago on my FreeBSD box lol
[08:32] <dabaR> gotit: why can you not enter the dir? cause you are trying to sudo cd?
[08:33] <Realmy> SilentDis, I'll just remove the 386 kernels, and stick with the generic then.  I've tried showing her how to hand compile w/gentoo, and it didn't go well hehe
[08:33] <SilentDis> realmy:  what speed celeron?
[08:33] <Realmy> SilentDis, 1.7GHz
[08:33] <J-_> will the breezy badger instruction work when dual booting ubuntu and windows on dapper drake?
[08:33] <Realmy> SilentDis, make that 1.8GHz
[08:34] <SilentDis> realmy:  i ask because i just installed to a P3 500 w/ 384 MB ram, thing runs like a dream
[08:34] <gotit> dabar: it says sudo cd command not found
[08:34] <Realmy> SilentDis, yeah, it's not bad, but I like to try to pull every ounce out I can
[08:34] <wyld> dabar: it's not the easyiest thing since canned cheese though
[08:35] <SilentDis> j-_:  if windows is installed first, both edgy and dapper will automagically add windows to the grub bootloader
[08:35] <Realmy> SilentDis, checkinstall is your friend hehe
[08:35] <dabaR> wyld: which is why there is a package:)
[08:35] <gotit> dabaR: with or without sudo , i cant enter
[08:35] <J-_> SilentDis: alright awesome, thanks!
[08:35] <SilentDis> realmy:  hehe :)
[08:35] <dabaR> gotit: sudo chmod a+rx /dir/path
[08:35] <reverseblade> dabaR, try sudo su and you become root
[08:35] <kishan> dabaR: same error  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36217/
[08:36] <wyld> dabar: hmmm, you might have a point there...
[08:36] <SilentDis> realmy:  i think you'd be fine with -generic...  i'm running an AMD athalon 1900+ here (1.6ghz), and edgy runs really well (-generic kernel)
[08:36] <dabaR> kishan: pastebin your /etc/samba/samba.conf file
[08:36] <senectus> When I upgraded to edgy my firefox didn't upgrade.. anyone know why?
[08:36] <SilentDis> j-_: no troubles :)
[08:37] <gotit> dabaR: its not workin /dir/path , path after the dir i dont understand that
[08:37] <dabaR> senectus: the ubuntu-desktop package was not installed?
[08:37] <reverseblade> senectus, no but some people have troubles with dapper -> edgy process as well
[08:37] <dabaR> gotit: just sudo chmod a+rx /something
[08:37] <dabaR> replace something with the real name of the ditr
[08:38] <Realmy> SilentDis, yeah, i'm going to leave her with it- if it breaks, I'll just do a manual build, and use synaptic to put it back to 386
[08:38] <Realmy> :)
[08:38] <gotit> dabaR: i wrote " sudo chmod a+rx /desktop , and it says no such file or dir
[08:38] <wyld> dabaR: you know what?.... on second thought, i'll just get the nice, compact, easy (albeit cheating) package.
[08:38] <dabaR> gotit: then it really does not exist, use the real path
[08:38] <dabaR> wyld: hehe
=== eno is now known as eno-zzz
[08:39] <SilentDis> realmy:  that works :)
[08:39] <gotit> dabaR: desktop is there when i ls
[08:39] <wyld> dabar: well, at least i did my best, that counts for something, right?
[08:39] <gotit> oh no
[08:40] <Realmy> alrighty, I'm going to reboot and hit the sack
[08:40] <Realmy> SilentDis, thank you for all of your help!!
[08:40] <SilentDis> realmy:  sleep well :)
[08:40] <gotit> SilentDis: can you please help me i cant enter into a directory  i am root
[08:41] <kishan> dabar: now i removed the new conf and replaced with the old conf now it installed without any errors
[08:41] <SilentDis> realmy: any time :)
[08:41] <gotit> kishan: good for you , dabaR is gone for a sleep
[08:41] <kishan> gotit and dabaR: thank you

[08:44] <gotit> reverseblade: how? SilentDis: any dir on main as root or without root i dont know why
[08:44] <tom_> how do i change the default browser from firefox to epiphany?
[08:45] <SilentDis> gotit:  do an ls -l.  find the directory in question.  what are the 'stats' on it?  the permissions, ownership, etc?
[08:45] <reverseblade> gotit, go to the directory one up level that you want to enter and write ls -l and inspect the permissions
[08:45] <reverseblade> gotit, if you want do a chmod  777 dir name ( I do not recommend it)  and everyone can enter
[08:45] <gotit> i cant enter in any dire
[08:46] <SilentDis> tom_: I haven't used epiphany personally... but usually, most browsers have a 'set as default' button in their options that'll take care of that for you
[08:46] <Turner> Where can I download something that doesn't have a graphical installer?
[08:46] <SilentDis> turner:  what are you looking to install?
[08:46] <Turner> ubuntu
[08:46] <Turner> It wont boot to the desktop.
[08:46] <SilentDis> turner:  you're looking to update your ubuntu install from a command line?
[08:46] <Turner> It just freezes at loading window manager -- the text is all big
[08:47] <Turner> no, I'm looking to fresh install
[08:47] <SilentDis> turner:  what happens if you try to boot the livecd?
[08:47] <ce_manis> join #surabaya
[08:47] <Arastoo> d
[08:47] <Turner> It'l boot till 'Loading Window Manager'
[08:47] <Turner> then the text will get all big, and it wont do anything
[08:47] <Turner> waited about 5 mins
[08:47] <Turner> cant move mouse or anything then
[08:47] <Arastoo> guys its me gotit, i was disc
[08:48] <Turner> disk works fine on another computer, know it's not the disc.
[08:48] <SilentDis> turner:  edgy, dapper?
[08:48] <Arastoo> on admim@admim-desktop
[08:48] <Turner> 6.10.
[08:48] <flasher222> i need to convert one pdf file/page into jpeg. can anyone help me, please?
[08:48] <Arastoo> cant go anywehere
[08:48] <Turner> should I try 6.06?
[08:49] <Arastoo> cant enter in the dir with the sudo
[08:49] <SilentDis> Arastoo:  do an ls -l one directory up.  what are the ownership and permissions of the directory you're having problems entering?
[08:49] <SilentDis> turner:  no...  edgy is a lot better at graphics detection...
[08:49] <SilentDis> turner:  what about the machine itself?  how much memory is in it?
[08:50] <Turner> 128
[08:50] <SilentDis> turner:  bingo, there's your problem :)
[08:50] <gephalt> Hi, yesterday someone mentioned here that I should use xinerama with twinview. I'd like to do that- but I only have one graphics card. come to think of it, is it even possible to do that?
[08:50] <VigoFusion> Yup
[08:50] <SilentDis> turner:  the live CDs require 256 at a minimum
[08:50] <Turner> yeah
[08:50] <Turner> I dont want a live cd.
[08:50] <avis> you need the alternate cd to install ubuntu with 128mb of memory.
[08:50] <Turner> I want just to install it?
[08:50] <Turner> yeah
[08:50] <Turner> Where can I get that
[08:50] <Turner> that was my first question in the begining.
[08:50] <FirstStrike> the ubuntu website
[08:50] <Turner> http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download
[08:50] <Arastoo> SilentDis: i am on the main, path it diff for every dir
[08:50] <SilentDis> !alternate | turner
[08:50] <ubotu> turner: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[08:50] <Turner> doesn't show any alternate cd
[08:50] <Arastoo> and i can enter in anyone
[08:50] <Arastoo> cant
[08:51] <FirstStrike> http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu//6.06/
[08:51] <avis> you might want to consider xubuntu or a command line system
[08:51] <Joe12345> can someone help me with wine
[08:51] <Joe12345> i dont get it at all
[08:51] <gephalt> Hello? China?
[08:51] <Turner> Windows XP runs on the system just fine, even if I use the command line installer and install gnome will it run?
[08:51] <Arastoo> SilentDis: i am on the main, path it diff for every dir and i cant enter in any dir or run the file
[08:51] <Joe12345> i installed it but i have to do something wine winecfg
[08:52] <SilentDis> arastoo:  that doesn't answer the question... i'm trying to determine the problem here hun.  could you please just pick ONE directory you're having problems getting into, then jot down the ls -l line for it, as well as what you get for pwd?  it will help me fix your problem
[08:52] <FirstStrike> Turner: Yes, it'll run. If you have a low end system I recommend Xubuntu over Ubuntu or Kubuntu though
[08:52] <FirstStrike> But Ubuntu should run decently
[08:52] <Turner> ok
[08:53] <Arastoo> SilentDis: eg desktop its drwxr-xr-x
[08:53] <gephalt> FirstStrike: or you could just be happy with fluxbox :)
[08:53] <FirstStrike> it depends on your taste of course. that's the beauty of linux.
[08:53] <FirstStrike> i'm a gnome fan myself
[08:54] <SilentDis> arastoo:  *sigh* ok, please do this...  "ls -l"  then "pwd" (2 commands, no quotes around either).  pastebin the whole mess please, and I'll look at it.
[08:54] <VigoFusion> Is Audacity a decent Web Radio tuner? or suggestions?
[08:54] <gephalt> FirstStrike: Yeah- beats kde by a long shot- but i still prefer kde-apps over gnome-apps. this is why i've got 2 DEs installed.
[08:54] <Joe12345> can someone help me get counterstrike running with wine?
[08:54] <Turner> thank you, FirstStrike.
[08:54] <gephalt> Joe12345: use cedega instead
[08:54] <Arastoo> SilentDis:pastebin??
[08:55] <Turner> guess I should go out to staples anyway and get some more ram
[08:55] <FirstStrike> Turner: no problem
[08:55] <Joe12345> ok gephalt
[08:55] <Arastoo> SilentDisi cant pastebin i am on the other system
[08:55] <gephalt> Arastoo: http://rafb.net/paste
[08:55] <FirstStrike> Turner: if at any point in time you want to try out gnome or kde you can install it through apt-get or aptitude
[08:55] <FirstStrike> That way you don't have to reinstall
[08:55] <SilentDis> !pastebin | arastoo
[08:55] <ubotu> arastoo: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:56] <Arastoo> SilentDis: i cant pastebin i am on the other system
[08:56] <Turner> ok
[08:56] <FirstStrike> gephalt: I personally don't like KDE because it reminds me of a fisher price toy set
[08:56] <FirstStrike> The GUI just doesn't do it for me
[08:56] <Joe12345> ick its not free
[08:56] <SilentDis> Arastoo:  i want to help you... but I need to know the environment we're working with in order to do so.  i'm useless without knowing EXACTLY what the system state is, and what happens.
[08:56] <Arastoo> SlentDis: for more than a week i am trying to get help for installing my modem
[08:56] <winand> how do you use svn
[08:56] <sonicGB>  FirstStrike: I personally don't like Gnome because it reminds me of a confused user.
[08:57] <FirstStrike> lol
[08:57] <gephalt> FirstStrike: true- there are things. besides my box is quite old. tried using KDE for a bit last night- and one app after another kept breaking down- so i alternate between fluxbox and gnome.
[08:57] <sonicGB> :-)
[08:57] <FirstStrike> To each his own
[08:57] <babo> hello
[08:58] <winand> I'm trying to make a svn repository on sourceforge
[08:58] <FirstStrike> I used to use KDE. It works, and it works pretty well for the most part. I just don't like it.

[08:58] <nothlit> FirstStrike, lol you can change themes/icons
[08:58] <FirstStrike> Yea, but the general feel is still there
[08:58] <gephalt> sonicGB: yeah- perhaps- but I've installed gnome for a few kids with really old systems and they couldn't be happier with the gloss and the glitter. :D
[08:58] <Arastoo> SlentDis: for more than a week i am trying to get help for installing my modem on that system and if iam not connected how can i pastebin
[08:58] <FirstStrike> Gnome is just right for me
[08:58] <VigoFusion> Thank you
[08:58] <nothlit> Theres no qt themes that make it look mature?
[08:58] <FirstStrike> I don't like konqueror either really
[08:58] <sonicGB> gephalt: I'm not having a go at anyone in particular... Gnome doesn't float my boat, but I'm sure plenty of other folks are perfectly happy.
[08:59] <babo> Sorry
[08:59] <sonicGB> today I'm on my third day with my first ever mac... believe me, at this point in time I'd be more comfortable with winders!!!
[09:00] <gephalt> sonicGB: yeah. no worries- am not a DE-fanatic and gnome-foot-logo flag waving jingoist.
[09:00] <Arastoo> SilentDis: anyways pwd says "/home/admim
[09:00] <sonicGB> (I already set it up to triple boot osx, winders and kubuntu, mostly just to prove it could be done!)
[09:00] <gephalt> whats winders? windows?
[09:00] <sonicGB> yeah
[09:00] <gephalt> ;P i've heard 'em call winbl0ws or something most of the time
[09:01] <sonicGB> lol!
[09:01] <FirstStrike> yea, or just doze
[09:01] <sonicGB> I think that "winders" is appropriately polite, and appropriately disrespectful at the same time! :-)
[09:01] <niko_m19> ok i made 14gigs or so of space on my hard drive for ubuntu now i'm running the install and am wondering how i should parition ubuntu for it?
[09:02] <niko_m19> is 9gigs for ext3 enough?  and how much should i do for the swap?
[09:02] <FirstStrike> you don't need 5 gigs for swap
[09:02] <gouki> niko_m19: I really recommend you use the auto partition feature
[09:02] <niko_m19> how much should i do for swap?
[09:03] <Madpilot> niko_m19, w/ 14Gb, use 4-5Gb for /, the rest for /home
[09:03] <gephalt> sonicGB: so how does OS X compare to linux- i know- not the same material. But i'm really tired of apple-junkies trying to convince me that I'll never go back to any other OS if I tried it.
[09:03] <niko_m19> i just set aside 14 gigs
[09:03] <Madpilot> niko_m19, how much RAM do you have?
[09:03] <niko_m19> i don't know if i will use it all or not
[09:03] <niko_m19> 500 something
[09:03] <FirstStrike> 512?
[09:03] <sonicGB> gephalt: the jury is still out here. It's only been about three days for me so far, and it's tough going.
[09:03] <niko_m19> 512 or or 530 or 560 i don't remember
[09:03] <FirstStrike> i have 1 gig set aside for swap, but with 2 gb of ram that's probably too much
[09:04] <Arastoo> SilentDis: the pastbin add is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36219/
[09:04] <sonicGB> I won't be truly happy until I can survive without a mouse... the lack of knowledge of keyboard shortcuts is driving me nuts so far!
[09:04] <Arastoo> SilentDis: are you there
[09:05] <niko_m19> so is ext3 the right partiton type for root partition
[09:05] <sonicGB> gephalt: I think that gnome or kde (ubuntu/kubuntu) are a lot more windows-like than mac. mac, so far, seems to be out there on its own with a whole bunch of new windowing-environment stuff that doesn't correspond to the rest
[09:05] <gephalt> Yeah, reminds me of this bit in the TrueX mouse website about how windows users have stronger index fingers with all the mouse-clicking
[09:05] <VigoFusion> Cant download realpalyer,,,hrmmmmm
[09:05] <Arastoo> can any one see this and tell me wats wrong pleazzzzz
[09:05] <niko_m19> i was thinking 9.77 gigs for ext3 and like 1 gig swap is that ok?  i'm doing it manually
[09:05] <Arastoo> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36219/
[09:05] <sonicGB> gephalt: I can get around winders quite happily with no mouse... that's what's bugging me here on osx.... can't manage wihtout a mouse
[09:06] <niko_m19> i have 14 gigs to work with but i don't have to use it all
[09:06] <niko_m19> i'm just looking for a basic install
[09:06] <belfegorash> can anyone tell mepls how to install counter strike on my computer?
[09:06] <niko_m19> i don't want to be here all night waiting for it to install
[09:06] <gouki> niko_m19: Once again... Why not use auto-partition?
[09:06] <NDPowerBook> gephalt: I'm a Mac user and a Linux user. What do you want to know?
[09:07] <niko_m19> the auto partition puts it in the most allocated space right?
[09:07] <FirstStrike> niko_m19: set 4 gigs for /, 5 gigs for /home and 1 gig for swap then install
[09:07] <Arastoo> can any one see this and tell me wats wrong pleazzzzz http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36219/
[09:07] <sonicGB> niko_m19: as far as swap goes, opinions differ. On BSD-style OSes, we used to use RAM x 2 for swap.... RAM x 1 is also a perfectly good option for swap, unless you don't have much RAM at all.
[09:07] <niko_m19> i didn't want it to use my winows partition
[09:07] <mogwai> VigoFusion: Have you tried adding the archive.cononical.com repo to your sources.list?
[09:07] <gephalt> how'd you mean its completely different? i've never even bothered with the website - cause I prolly won'r be able to afford one anytime soon. but do tell me. How does the windowing differ? from the available linux DEs.
[09:07] <Arastoo> i cant enter in any dir
[09:07] <niko_m19> it says it can install into my usb drive to but i don't want to try that yet
[09:07] <FirstStrike> niko_m19: it won't use your windows partition. it'll just use free space
[09:07] <gephalt> are we talking about the menu at the top and the application dock OSX dock or smth?
[09:08] <sonicGB> Arastoo: what's theproblem?
[09:08] <Arastoo> can any one see this and tell me wats wrong pleazzzzz http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36219/
[09:08] <Arastoo> i can not enter in to any dir
[09:08] <sonicGB> Arastoo: see in the first column, some of those have a 'd', and others have a '-'
[09:09] <sonicGB> Arastoo: the ones with a 'd' are directories... the ones with a '-' are not
[09:09] <mutineer612> Anyone know how I can get openoffice 2.0.4 via adept package manager?
[09:09] <Arastoo> d but no a
[09:09] <niko_m19> one of the options for partitioning is use the largest continious free space
[09:09] <sonicGB> you can't 'cd' to 'hardware' because it is not a dir
[09:09] <niko_m19> i don't want that to be my usb drive either though
[09:09] <niko_m19> if i do forward will it show where its going to put it before it starts doing it?
[09:09] <Arastoo> i cant cd to speedtouchconf-27-jun-2006 too
[09:10] <mutineer612> Anyone know how I can get openoffice 2.0.4 via adept package manager?
[09:10] <desrt> i run ubuntu on a server.  i have some stuff installed from universe.  i want to be alerted in the future if there are any security problems that i should know about.  what do i do?
[09:10] <FirstStrike> niko_m19: yes
[09:10] <gephalt> Arastoo: can you type: "ls -alh  speedtouchconf-27-Jun-2006"
[09:10] <Arastoo> oh i can , is it so much case sensitive
[09:10] <Arastoo> i dont belive it
[09:11] <sonicGB> Arastoo: everything is case sensitive
=== selzy_imut is now known as co[
[09:11] <Arastoo> no i cant run the file "speedtouchconf.sh"
[09:11] <gephalt> Arastoo: you don't have to type in the whole thing
[09:12] <gephalt> just type in the first few letters and hit tab for auto-completion.
=== co[ is now known as co[[55555
=== co[[55555 is now known as co[] ttm
[09:12] <Arastoo> ok
[09:13] <sonicGB> Arastoo: try ./speedtouchconf.sh
[09:13] <sonicGB> Arastoo: (put dot-slash   './' in front of it)
[09:13] <burepe> Can you change the language on the live cd?
[09:13] <Arastoo> cool
[09:14] <Arastoo> ok operation not permitted but i think old settings are fine
[09:14] <desrt> ok.  different question: how do i tell what packages from universe i have installed?
[09:15] <Arastoo> now when i type " speedtouch-start" it says starting adsl connection but then nothin
[09:15] <avis> anyone know of a gnome gui front end for the universe repo called "par2" ?
[09:15] <desrt> (or, equiv -- what packages not in main)
[09:15] <z9999> Each time we try to update the reppository indexes we get an error from one repository site:
[09:15] <z9999> http://th.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper/universe/source/Sources.gz:Sub-processes gzip returned an error code (1)
[09:15] <z9999> Can someone inform us how to work around this?
[09:16] <desrt> z9999; change your repo for now
[09:16] <lardarse> hey... how do you tell ubuntu to stop using gnome-screensaver and start using xscreensaver ?
[09:16] <Arastoo> now when i type " speedtouch-start" it says starting adsl connection but then nothin
[09:16] <z9999> desrt: Sounds good, we're new, can you give instructions on how and what repo to use?
[09:17] <desrt> z9999; just remove the "th." from the front
[09:17] <desrt> z9999; then apt-get update again
[09:17] <ademan> is there any risk resizing an ntfs partition with gparted?
[09:17] <desrt> ademan; yes.
[09:18] <desrt> always make backups
[09:18] <ademan> is it reasonably low?
[09:18] <ademan> how do you back up an entire partition?
[09:18] <desrt> yes.  it's reasonably low.
[09:18] <sonicGB> ademan: there's aways risk with resizing partitions. do backups unless you can afford to lose the lot.
[09:18] <frogzoo> ademan: tar or cpio
[09:18] <desrt> but it's definitely non-zero so you'd better be able to live without your data
[09:18] <frogzoo> !backups | ademan
[09:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about backups - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:20] <sonicGB> Arastoo: I'm not ignoring you, I'm just out of my depth at this point. I've not ever confiugured an adsl modem on... well.. anything. I've always used a router.
[09:20] <lardarse> anyone?
[09:20] <z9999> We're using the Synaptic Package manager, and haven't found where the repo site is stored and where we can make such a change.
[09:21] <damageDOne> Hi, I'm using edgy and I got wireless working on two laptops yesterday but today one of them has stopped working and I tried disabling/enabling but to no avail. Has anyone had this problem?
[09:21] <desrt> z9999; drop to a terminal

[09:21] <desrt> :wq
[09:21] <gephalt> Arastoo: do you see any manuals/README files inside that speedtouch directory?
[09:21] <Arastoo> its configued i think cause it does not show any errors but it does not work
[09:21] <Arastoo> nope
[09:21] <Jordan_U> lardarse: sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver
[09:21] <desrt> z9999; then run apt-get update
[09:21] <desrt> z9999; that should do it for you
[09:21] <lardarse> Jordan_U: it will be as simple as removing the onld screensaver engine?
[09:22] <lardarse> old*
[09:22] <Arastoo> oh God , how could it work, i am using the line on this system :)
[09:22] <avis> sonicGB, the simlest way it to plug it into your ethernet port and type 192.168.0.1 into your browser and then enter your login details and password, then when its connected have it get the network from dhcp.  similuarly, if you had a router you could use the same method instead of configuring pppoe -- its all in the bios.
[09:22] <gephalt> Arastoo: its really difficult to get any usb-modem to work- although not wholly impossible- but you've got to read up in the forums- you'll learn a lot more that way than asking here...
[09:22] <asdx> does debian/ubuntu handles 32/64 bit mixed apps?
[09:22] <asdx> 32 bit in 64 bit ubuntu i mean
[09:22] <Jordan_U> lardarse: I believe so, do you just want to edit your screensaver prefs / use xscreensaver screensavers?
[09:22] <mural1> hi all..
[09:22] <nothlit> asdx, yes
[09:22] <nothlit> !linux32 | asdx
[09:22] <mural1> can someone tell me how to use doxygen???
[09:22] <ubotu> linux32: Wrapper to set the execution domain. In component main, is extra. Version 1-3 (edgy), package size 5 kB, installed size 56 kB
[09:23] <lardarse> no... i want to tell it to use the xcreensaver engine instead
[09:23] <nothlit> asdx, also chroots
[09:23] <sonicGB> avis: great if it's a router, not so easy if it's a modem (or worse, a usb modem!)...
[09:23] <avis> a usb modem i can see your point but most computers have ethernet ports
[09:23] <lardarse> (the "hacks" that both engines use are the same package - xscreensaver-data)
[09:23] <avis> speedtouch is a dsl modem
[09:23] <sonicGB> avis: if you can help Arastoo, please do. I'm not having a problem, but Arastoo is
[09:24] <gloin> !dcc
[09:24] <ubotu> There are people around who think it is funny to abuse a bug in certain routers by sending invalid DCC commands. When bitten by this bug ops in #ubuntu remove users so they are no longer targets. To fix it have a look here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixDCCExploit
[09:24] <ademan> !ntfs
[09:24] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[09:24] <Jordan_U> lardarse: there is a thread on Ubuntuforums.org for doing that
[09:24] <lardarse> i'll look...
[09:24] <lardarse> (i'm guessing that this is somehing that has changed since hoary/breezy)
[09:24] <avis> its simple, login to your service provider from your modem rather than configure pppoe by plugging it in and doing 192.168.0.1 with a direct route to speedtouch
[09:25] <mural1> ubotu::can u tell me how to use doxygen?? i tried going thro the doc but couldn figure out how to use it
[09:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about can u tell me how to use doxygen?? i tried going thro the doc but couldn figure out how to use it - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:25] <Jordan_U> lardarse: Yes, xscreensaver was replaced by gnome-screensaver in Dapper
[09:25] <lardarse> ok...
[09:27] <echosystm> guys, i want to install ubuntu minimally (no gnome or kde, just blackbox), should i select text mode isntall from the alt cd or command line install?
[09:27] <econobeing> !svn
[09:27] <ubotu> svn is Subversion: an open-source revision control system, which aims to be a compelling replacement for CVS. See http://subversion.tigris.org/
[09:27] <lardarse> Jordan_U: you wouldn't happen to have a link, would you?
[09:27] <Jordan_U> lardarse: I'll look...
[09:28] <VigoFusion> Ok, I am to feeble minded to understand this. It was fun, maybe I will read another book and learn something. I thank you one and all for the kindness and help.

[10:00] <Czarek> hi. how to easy instll audacious under ubuntu?
[10:02] <kreig> greetings
[10:03] <kreig> SBCL is complaining that my ubuntu laptop doesn't have nptl support in glibc
[10:03] <kreig> I'm running 2.3.6 ubuntu libc6
[10:03] <kreig> what do I do to get NPTL support in glibc?
[10:03] <xeQter`> good
[10:03] <kreig> upgrade to edgy?
[10:04] <kreig> put a quarter in the floppy drive?
[10:04] <nothlit> !synaptic | Czarek
[10:04] <ubotu> Czarek: synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[10:05] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, nothing in latest ubuntu releases glibc nptl is turned on by default
[10:05] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, AFAIK linuxthreads is not supported
[10:05] <echosystm> apt-get install xserver-xorg xfonts-base xdm xterm
[10:06] <echosystm> is that the same as x-window-system-core
[10:06] <echosystm> ?
[10:06] <kreig> ColonelZarkawi: so I gotta upgrade to eddgy?  or my sbcl binary is smoking krack?
[10:07] <tom_> anyone know how to make epiphany the default browser
[10:07] <kreig> I'm breezy now
[10:07] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, what does libc.so.6|grep -i nptl say?
[10:08] <crimsun> kreig: correct, only edgy (6.10) and newer have NPTL support.
[10:08] <kreig> oh man, do i gotta use taht event subsystem too?
[10:09] <kreig> the init replacement
[10:09] <ColonelZarkawi> or just run /lib/libc.so.6 it will tell you if NPTL is on
[10:09] <kreig> ok, thanx yall
[10:09] <eloquence_> mew
[10:09] <kreig> it is linuxthreads
[10:09] <ColonelZarkawi> I think NPTL was already available in dapper
[10:09] <ColonelZarkawi> I doubt dapper was released only with linuxthreads support
[10:09] <kreig> hmm
[10:10] <ColonelZarkawi> linuxthreads is really really old
[10:10] <kreig> ColonelZarkawi: well, I got that, and apt-cache search nptl isn't runing anything up
[10:10] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, nptl is part of the C library
[10:11] <kreig> yah, so I search for nptl enabled libc
[10:11] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, is included in the libc6 package
[10:11] <deep> j #ubuntu.se
[10:11] <kreig> ok, then something is wack
[10:11] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, yes probably you can search for that
[10:11] <deep> sry :D
[10:11] <viller> there's no build-essentials anymore?
[10:11] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, but AFAIK there is no special package with NPTL turned on. I think it is turned on by default
[10:12] <Joe12345> can someone help me with wine
[10:12] <frogzoo> does using esd degrade audio?
[10:12] <Joe12345> i read the wiki cant figure it out
[10:12] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, or is turned on by default, or only supports linuxthreads, what I doubt
[10:12] <frogzoo> Joe12345: wassup?
[10:12] <Joe12345> well i run winecfg or any wine program line
[10:12] <viller> there's no build-essentials anymore?
[10:12] <kreig> yah, it says libc6-i686 includes nptl support
[10:12] <frogzoo> viller: build-essential
[10:12] <Joe12345> and it says Warning: could not find DOS drive for current working directory '/home/joe', starting in the Windows directory.
[10:12] <Joe12345> i dont know what to do in the Drives tab of wine
[10:12] <viller> frogzoo: lol one letter difference :D
[10:12] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, there you go, and which version of ubuntu are you using?
[10:12] <nicola> I'd like to add an application to the applications list for the ones is not necessary the password, how do I do it ?
[10:13] <Joe12345> like C: should it be my NTFS windows drive?
[10:13] <Joe12345> or what
[10:13] <frogzoo> Joe12345: you just map linux paths to dos drives
[10:13] <Joe12345> so a DOS drive is required?
[10:13] <kreig> dapper
[10:13] <Hellevator> nicola: what do you mean "For the ones is not necessary the password"
[10:13] <kreig> ColonelZarkawi: dapper
[10:13] <Joe12345> somethings not right
[10:13] <kreig> a 2.6.15 kernel
[10:13] <crimsun> kreig: sorry, we only recently _dropped_ LT support.
[10:13] <Joe12345> can u tell me what you have for C:
[10:13] <frogzoo> Joe12345: no no - say you want to map e:   to /usr/lib   etc.
[10:13] <ubuntu> hi
[10:14] <ColonelZarkawi> ok, so your program should work. If not you need to check the ABIs...
=== ubuntu is now known as vb2005
[10:14] <deep> Does linux have to be so safe? :D
[10:14] <nicola> Hellevator, I mean that I would like to run synaptic without inserting the password evrytime I start it, I know it's not safe but I don't care
[10:14] <kreig> something fishy
[10:14] <kreig> cause even the sbcl package don't work
[10:14] <kreig> like one I KNOW worked before
[10:15] <ColonelZarkawi> crimsun, you claimed something different, you said ubuntu didn't support NPTL until edgy, which is blantantly wrong
[10:15] <crimsun> ColonelZarkawi: that's why I apologised.
[10:15] <Hellevator> nicola: this is will do it. http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_use_.22sudo.22_without_prompt_for_password_.28not_secure.29
[10:15] <ColonelZarkawi> ok I accept your apology, don't do it again
[10:15] <nicola> thanks Hellevator
[10:15] <kreig> maybe I fucked up a kernel rebuild
[10:15] <kreig> brb 8)
[10:15] <crimsun> ColonelZarkawi: eh?
[10:16] <frogzoo> ColonelZarkawi: support in this chan is on a best effort basis
[10:16] <Joe12345> ohhh
[10:16] <Joe12345> so i have to make a D: that points to /home/joe
[10:16] <Gumby> this is offtopic so if it bothers anyone just tell me to shut up.  does anyone here know of any blog software that also allows a user to post photos without having to enter a URL to the photo
[10:16] <deep> Can i give a user rootaccess? I want to be able to write just about everywhere with my user. =D
[10:16] <damageDOne> Hi, sorry if anyone replied to my question earlier ... I'm having problems with identify etc.
[10:16] <deep> Without sudo, that is :D
[10:17] <echosystm> can someone help me install a window manager?
[10:17] <echosystm> ive got x and the window manager installed
[10:17] <echosystm> but
[10:17] <echosystm> do i need xdm?
[10:18] <echosystm> how do i get into the window manager?
[10:18] <crimsun> echosystm: what did you install?
[10:18] <Joe12345> how do you change a sym link
[10:18] <echosystm> blackbox
[10:18] <echosystm> should be the same as fluxbox
[10:18] <crimsun> Joe12345: just overwrite it.
[10:18] <crimsun> echosystm: on top of an already-installed Ubuntu?
[10:18] <echosystm> just do "startx" and it should go ahead?
[10:18] <echosystm> no
[10:18] <echosystm> im doing it from command line
[10:18] <damageDOne> Does anyone know about evolution not having filters apply as mail comes in?
[10:18] <Joe12345> ok
[10:18] <crimsun> echosystm: you don't need xdm, no.
[10:18] <echosystm> ok
[10:19] <echosystm> so ive got a fresh ubuntu command line install
[10:19] <echosystm> all ive done so far
[10:19] <echosystm> is
[10:19] <echosystm> install x-window-system-core and blackbox
[10:20] <crimsun> you'll likely need to reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:20] <nicola> should I cut this "root ALL=(ALL) ALL" and write this "root  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" ?
[10:20] <Hellevator> no
[10:20] <echosystm> im gonna install the nvidia drivers
[10:20] <crimsun> nicola: it's not recommended, but you can do whatever you want
[10:20] <echosystm> which has a tool to do that
[10:20] <nicola> I mean, will this edit let me uso sudo without prompting the password ?
[10:20] <echosystm> am i best off installing the proprietary drivers or the ones from the depositories?
[10:20] <Hellevator> nicola: add another line and replace "root" with your username
[10:21] <crimsun> echosystm: it's recommended that you use the "Ubuntu method" of enabling the Nvidia drivers from the repositories.
[10:21] <nicola> ok
[10:21] <nicola> "nicola  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
[10:21] <Hellevator> like this is what I would have   rob	ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
[10:21] <Hellevator> nicola: yes
[10:21] <nicola> ok
[10:21] <echosystm> so apt-get install nvidia-kernel-common nvidia-glx
[10:21] <echosystm> ?
[10:22] <Jeffm515> morning everyone..
[10:22] <ColonelZarkawi> good morning
[10:22] <kreig> hehe
[10:22] <kreig> I think I fucked osmething up when I put xen on this machine
[10:22] <kreig> I aint running in xen now, but I mighta changed something
[10:22] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, hmm that could be the reason yes
[10:22] <gnomefreak> kreig: please watch your language
[10:22] <Jeffm515> okay, so I'm totally new here.. but somethings wrong on my install.. is there a guru present?
[10:22] <kane77> how do I find out wether root user is created?
[10:22] <ColonelZarkawi> gnomefreak, ? what did he say?
[10:22] <gnomefreak> echosystm: you shouldnt need to intall nvidia-kernel-*
[10:22] <kreig> I said f word
[10:22] <Joe12345> whats ..drive_c mean
[10:23] <Joe12345> how would i cd to that
[10:23] <nicola> thanks guys, looks like it worked
[10:23] <crimsun> echosystm: as gnomefreak mentioned, it should be installed already if linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) is installed
[10:23] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, oohhhhhh how terrible nooooo! *shrug*
[10:23] <echosystm> oh
[10:23] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, yes probably your kernel broke the ABI between libc and the kernel
[10:23] <echosystm> um
[10:23] <Jeffm515> when I select any option on the install screen, it just reboots my PC
[10:23] <echosystm> how do i know if that is already installed?
[10:24] <crimsun> echosystm: dpkg -l linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)|grep ^ii
[10:24] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, maybe you should try with a vanilla kernel, or with the ubuntu kernel without xen
[10:24] <ademan> hey in the installer my friend had the mount point for another partition be /data he went into fstab and changed it to /media/data and rebooted but it's not mounting to /media/data
[10:24] <n3m3s1s> can i move my 5.10 to the last ubuntu version ?
[10:24] <echosystm> what does this part mean: $(uname -r) ?
[10:24] <Joe12345> sick it sowrking
[10:24] <crimsun> echosystm: use it verbatim.
[10:24] <gnomefreak> echosystm: all you will need is xorg nvidia-glx  and the l-r-m-$)uname-r) package but i think nvidia-glx grabs that
[10:24] <eloquence_> can sum1 help with this: http://pastebin.ca/273984 >>> installing ipw3945 for my laptop
[10:25] <echosystm> so confused :(
[10:25] <echosystm> just tell me what to type in
[10:25] <echosystm> haha
[10:25] <crimsun> echosystm: just type it.
[10:25] <echosystm> please
[10:25] <gnomefreak> echosystm: in terminal type uname -r
[10:25] <gnomefreak> echosystm: replace $(uname-r) with the output
[10:25] <echosystm> 2.6.17-10-generic
[10:25] <n3m3s1s> hey?!
[10:26] <guerrero> haha
[10:26] <gnomefreak> linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic
[10:26] <echosystm> ok so dpkg -l linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic
[10:26] <guerrero> poopotootti
[10:26] <guerrero> ha
[10:26] <echosystm> ?
[10:26] <guerrero> *ahem*
[10:26] <echosystm> or apt-get
[10:26] <crimsun> echosystm: or you could have just typed $(uname -r) instead of expanding it manually
[10:26] <poopotootti> guerrero what
[10:26] <guerrero> poopotootti: wut?
[10:26] <Jeffm515_> sorry, got booted
[10:26] <echosystm> what command am i actually running though
[10:26] <Zaggynl> Hi, when I start amarok, 3 processes pop up, 1x amarok and 2x amarokapp, and they use a whopping 130MB together, is this normal?
[10:26] <echosystm> apt-get install?
[10:26] <poopotootti> u hilichted
[10:26] <n3m3s1s> gnomefreak can i move my 5.10 to "Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft" ?
[10:27] <gnomefreak> sudo apt-get install nvidia-gxl linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic
[10:27] <poopotootti> *hilighted
[10:27] <echosystm> ok
[10:27] <echosystm> thankyou !!! :D
[10:27] <Jeffm515_> okay, so anyone got any ideas?
[10:27] <guerrero> poopotootti: cuz yer nick is funny
[10:27] <gnomefreak> n3m3s1s: upgrade to 6.06 than to 6.10
[10:27] <guerrero> poopotootti: wuts that man in finnish
[10:27] <guerrero> ^man^mean
[10:27] <gnomefreak> echosystm: you might need to install xorg also
[10:27] <poopotootti> it dont mean anything
[10:27] <n3m3s1s> I haven't the 6.06 version :( i have just 5.10 :x
[10:27] <n3m3s1s> 5.10 -> 6.06 -> 6.10 ?
[10:27] <guerrero> poopotootti: i like it
[10:27] <stork> where can i place a script that will be executed when my computer starts up (before x server loads)
[10:28] <echosystm> xorg should be part of x-window-system-core right?
[10:28] <echosystm> becuase i already installed that
[10:28] <gnomefreak> n3m3s1s: yes skipping versions can hurt your system and leave it unstable
[10:28] <gnomefreak> echosystm: no
[10:28] <echosystm> oh
[10:28] <echosystm> ok
[10:28] <gnomefreak> xorg == meta package
[10:28] <echosystm> rightyo
[10:28] <Jeffm515_> trying to install is just causing a reboot cycle..
[10:28] <echosystm> what exactly is in it?
[10:28] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, in /etc/init.d and then use use update-rc.d to start the script on a given runlevel
[10:28] <echosystm> sorry for all the questions
[10:28] <echosystm> i just want to learn what im doing
[10:28] <echosystm> :P
[10:28] <ColonelZarkawi> I mean to configure the system to start the script on a given runlevel
[10:28] <gnomefreak> apt-cache show xorg
[10:29] <stork> i figured out my problem with nvidia drivers.. each time i reboot, the nvidia kernel is disposed of and the ubuntu nvidia kernel is used instead, which isn't compatible with my drivers... so i need to run the nvidia installer at boot time to place the kernel module where it should be
[10:29] <crimsun> stork: keep in mind that if you use a display manager, it starts fairly early in the init sequence.
[10:30] <gnomefreak> echosystm: if you run the above command in terminal everthing next to work depends is what it will bring in
[10:30] <makgq> join #uoft
[10:30] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, you can remove the module instead
[10:30] <n3m3s1s> so gnomefreak, what i should do ?
[10:30] <stork> ColonelZarkawi, how would i do that?
[10:30] <jcore> hello.
[10:30] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, with rmmod
[10:30] <gnomefreak> n3m3s1s: upgrade to dapper first
[10:30] <echosystm> rightyo
[10:30] <ColonelZarkawi> rmmod removes modules (if the kernel supports removal of modules)
[10:30] <echosystm> thanks man!
[10:30] <ColonelZarkawi> with modprobe you can then load the module you want
[10:31] <Jeffm515_> .... please? anyone??
[10:31] <echosystm> so
[10:31] <echosystm> after that
[10:31] <stork> ColonelZarkawi, as far as i know, both modules are called nvidia
[10:31] <echosystm> i run nvidia-xconfig
[10:31] <jcore> does that XGL (the thing that makes the desktops spin) work on ubuntu 5.06?
[10:31] <gnomefreak> echosystm: no
[10:31] <echosystm> no?
[10:31] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, there must be a different files in the filesystem if they are different modules
[10:31] <gnomefreak> echosystm: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:31] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: what did you do?
[10:31] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, you can search in the /lib/modules directory for all nvidia modules
[10:32] <Jeffm515_> I'm just trying to install....
[10:32] <echosystm> doesnt it do the same thing?
[10:32] <Jeffm515_> any option I choose, just reboots
[10:32] <gnomefreak> echosystm: change the drivers from nv to nvidia and make sure your BUSID is correct
[10:32] <echosystm> ok anyway
[10:32] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, if there is a name conflict probably you need to remove the "wrong" module
[10:32] <echosystm> i'll use your method
[10:32] <gnomefreak> echosystm: no
[10:32] <echosystm> ok
[10:32] <gnomefreak> echosystm: need to check BUSID
[10:32] <stork> ColonelZarkawi, would it be possible to remove the nvidia kernel module package ? (there must be one, right?)
[10:32] <echosystm> so i should reconfigure xorg-server first
[10:32] <gnomefreak> no
[10:32] <echosystm> before i edit the xorg.config?
[10:32] <echosystm> :S
[10:32] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: does the ubuntu live cd start, do you see a splash screen?
[10:32] <dw_> i have a laptop with hda_intel soundchip and headphone jack isn't working. so i compiled the newest alsa-drivers (1.0.13) for the running kernel (2.6.17 generic). this seems to be working as cat /proc/asound/version tells me that alsa version is indeed 1.0.13. however, when gdm starts, the "beeping" sound (aplay??) is in a loop and never stops and so i can't login into gnome. anyone has a hint for me on how to debug this problem?
[10:33] <echosystm> but wont my xorg.config be wrong at the moment? since i havent set it up
[10:33] <gnomefreak> echosystm: thats what we are doing now
[10:33] <echosystm> ok
[10:33] <echosystm> :)
[10:33] <Jeffm515_> I get the splash... 6.06 -- gives me full options to test, install, ect ect.. any one of 'em just powercycles
[10:33] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, sure, if you are using a stock kernel it should be safe to remove that package... I haven't done it (I use kernel.org kernels) so be careful when removing it
[10:33] <echosystm> thanks heaps for your help i really appreciate it
[10:33] <stork> hmm
[10:33] <stork> there are dependencies
[10:33] <jcore> what are the big differences between 5.10 and 5.06?
[10:33] <echosystm> so after ive edited the xorg.config
[10:34] <echosystm> i can just startx and it should load up blackbox?
[10:34] <stork> ColonelZarkawi, what are the linux-restricted-modules packages used for?
[10:34] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: have you try to edit the boot command (I think it is F6)?
[10:34] <gnomefreak> echosystm: you should beable to run sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[10:34] <Jeffm515_> yea that's what I've started to try.. but so far, nothing works...
[10:34] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: and removed the splash an quiet parameters
[10:34] <gnomefreak> echosystm: or replace gdm with whatever display manager you are using
[10:34] <echosystm> i dont have gdm installed
[10:34] <echosystm> is gdm best?
[10:34] <gnomefreak> echosystm: you can install xdm if you wish it should depends on much
[10:34] <Jeffm515_> how do you remove the quiet prims?
[10:35] <crimsun> stork: they contain the restricted (non-free licenses) kernel drivers, such as nvidia's, ati's, madwifi's, the userspace ipw3945 daemon, etc.
[10:35] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: i think you hit F6 on the boot menu...
[10:35] <gnomefreak> Jeffm515_: i dont believe you can on the livecd
[10:35] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, I think they contain non-free modules
[10:35] <echosystm> xorg was already installed for me
[10:35] <gnomefreak> HuibertG1ll: is right i forgot about that
[10:35] <ColonelZarkawi> stork, not sure if they include nvidia modules though
[10:35] <echosystm> it must be part of the core package i mentioned earlier
[10:35] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: then you delete the last two (I think) paramters
[10:35] <biskvitka> hi Ineed a little help if someone please private
[10:35] <biskvitka> hi Ineed a little help if someone please private
[10:36] <KuriKai> Does wine work well with compiz?
[10:36] <jw_606> Hello I am getting an error while following the Wiki ATI driver instructions, here is the error in paste bin http://paste.getlinuxhelp.org/38192
[10:36] <stork> ColonelZarkawi, they seem to depend on the package 'nvidia-kernel-common'...
[10:36] <Jeffm515_> great....
[10:36] <stork> crimsun, are they required?
[10:36] <gnomefreak> biskvitka: asking in channel your better to get an answer
[10:36] <echosystm> so is xdm better than gdm?
[10:36] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: this should give you all the kernel messages, scrolling by while the system boots..
[10:36] <crimsun> stork: if you wish to use the binary-only nvidia driver in the repository, yes
[10:36] <gnomefreak> echosystm: no there is no better than anything
[10:36] <echosystm> ok
[10:36] <gnomefreak> it depends on what you want
[10:36] <Jeffm515_> no primaters are listed when I hit F6
[10:36] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: could you mention my name while replying here, then my irc client highlights your line :-)
[10:37] <echosystm> whats the difference?
[10:37] <gnomefreak> echosystm: do you want gnome/xfce/kde
[10:37] <echosystm> no
[10:37] <gnomefreak> echosystm: xdm == debian log in
[10:37] <echosystm> just blackbox
[10:37] <echosystm> nothing else
[10:37] <biskvitka> I am with Ubuntu 6.10 what player should I install or how can i get codec for the default player?
[10:37] <Jeffm515_> wiat..
[10:37] <echosystm> and i dont want it to load up automatically
[10:37] <Jeffm515_> I see what you're talking about..
[10:37] <ColonelZarkawi> biskvitka, mplayer
[10:37] <gnomefreak> echosystm: your better off with xdm if blackbox doesnt install one
[10:37] <biskvitka> yes i have it
[10:37] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: there must be a text in the boot menu telling you about extra options
[10:37] <biskvitka> but i cant install it
[10:38] <Jeffm515_> rw quiet splash
[10:38] <Jeffm515_> remove it?
[10:38] <echosystm> ok
[10:38] <rouan> erm... can anyone help? my samba incoming speed is very slow (like 2mb/sec on 100mbit) while outgoing is fast 8mb/sec
[10:38] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: remove quiet and splash
[10:38] <Jeffm515_> annnd....
[10:38] <echosystm> xdm is installed
[10:38] <Jeffm515_> reboots.
[10:38] <gnomefreak> good
[10:38] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: annnd, hit enter
[10:38] <Jeffm515_> lol
[10:38] <echosystm> can i start blackbox just by typing "startx" any way?
[10:38] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: did you see anything?
[10:38] <biskvitka> ColonelZarkawi:  help with install/
[10:38] <Jeffm515_> sorry.. I was waiting for it to reboot..
[10:38] <gnomefreak> echosystm: sudo /etc/init.d/xdm stop
[10:39] <echosystm> or do i have to do xdm start every time?
[10:39] <gnomefreak> echosystm: than /etc/init.d/xdm start
[10:39] <ColonelZarkawi> biskvitka, apt-get install mplayer
[10:39] <Jeffm515_> yea, no go..
[10:39] <echosystm> i
[10:39] <kreig> awoooot!
[10:39] <echosystm> i would like less typing iff possible
[10:39] <gnomefreak> echosystm: it will start on its own when X is working correctly
[10:39] <kreig> ColonelZarkawi: ok, so I had moved /lib/tls out of the way
[10:39] <kreig> ColonelZarkawi: once I put that back and nuke my /etc/ld.so.cache it all worked
[10:39] <gnomefreak> echosystm: copy and paste it :)
[10:39] <kreig> thanx for the help yall
[10:39] <jcore> can anyone direct tell me about how to make your desktop "spin like a 3dbox?" I think its called XGL?
[10:39] <ColonelZarkawi> biskvitka, apt-get install w32codecs
[10:40] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: what did you see,.... normaly atleast a "syslinx 2.-BLAH BLAH booting" should be seen
[10:40] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, great news
[10:40] <gnomefreak> ColonelZarkawi: w32codecs are not in repos
[10:40] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, so xen breaks the ABI? You used the official ubuntu xen package?
[10:40] <kreig> sbcl 1.0 is go, awooot
[10:40] <Jeffm515_> it comes up with loading linux Kernel, and reboots.
[10:40] <biskvitka> ColonelZarkawi:  un secceed to download it
[10:40] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: could you mention my name with every reply here, then my irc client highlights your line :-)
[10:40] <Jeffm515_> keep in mind, it's a compaq evo tower..
[10:40] <ColonelZarkawi> biskvitka? of course w32codecs is in the repos
[10:40] <kreig> ColonelZarkawi: Well, Xen is not tls compat, at least not when I installed it here in order to try and get a Plan9 instance running under it 8)
[10:40] <crimsun> ColonelZarkawi: no, he moved /lib/tls elsewhere.
[10:41] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: what was the last line...
[10:41] <polo_epic> can someone help me ? i'm a new user and i have a little problem with the terminal msg me
[10:41] <gnomefreak> ColonelZarkawi: no it isnt
[10:41] <kreig> crimsun: yah, I moved it cause xen needed me too
[10:41] <maxsof2> morning all. it's possible use graphical mode as root?
[10:41] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: ok, try again to remove the boot parameters, then ad:
[10:41] <biskvitka> ColonelZarkawi:  repos? the codec same thing
[10:42] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515: "noacpi noapic pci=noacpi" as extra parameters
[10:42] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, if you used official only packages, the behaviour you got is a mistake from the ubuntu packagers
[10:42] <Jeffm515_> ok
[10:43] <brainiac_ghost> lol, xchat defaults FTW :P
[10:43] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| same
[10:43] <kreig> ColonelZarkawi: nah, it was all handrolled stuff
[10:44] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: not good.
[10:44] <ColonelZarkawi> kreig, haha :)
[10:44] <mural1> hi all...am back
[10:44] <jw_606> Can anyone help me with an error I get white following the Wiki ATI driver installation guide please?
[10:44] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| it's a compaq Evo tower,.. and I'm willing to bet it has something to do with that.
[10:44] <jw_606> while*
[10:44] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: are you sure the boot cd is without errors and scratches?
[10:44] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| yup
[10:45] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| it did the same thing on 5.06
[10:45] <echosystm> gnomefreak
[10:45] <stork> crimsun, what do you mean binary only driver? i was planning on using the one downloaded from nvidias website
[10:45] <gnomefreak> echosystm:
[10:45] <echosystm> i didnt want it to load x automatically
[10:45] <echosystm> lol
[10:45] <mural1> can someone please tell me which plugins to download for playin wmv,mpeg,mpg,avi files with totem??????????
[10:45] <jw_606> Here is the error I get when trying to follow the Wiki ATI installation guide, http://paste.getlinuxhelp.org/38192
[10:45] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: could you give me the exact compaq name, maybe google can help
[10:45] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1||  but I finally got it to load somehow.. 2:00am with poor notes..
[10:45] <echosystm> i do mostly command line stuff
[10:45] <crimsun> stork: I use the term "binary-only" to differentiate 'nvidia' from the free 'nv'
[10:45] <gnomefreak> echosystm: you can set that somewhere but im not sure on that
[10:45] <echosystm> thats why i got confused when you said to install xdm
[10:45] <stork> i see
[10:45] <Jeffm515_> <<flips the lightswitch to read...>>
[10:46] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| sorry, this one's on a presario 26020wm
[10:46] <stork> so i'm gonna try and remove the restricted modules
[10:46] <Jeffm515_> other tower was an evo
[10:46] <echosystm> what would happen if i typed "startx" without xdm installed gnomefreak?
[10:47] <crimsun> echosystm: startx does not depend on xdm
[10:47] <gnomefreak> echosystm: might start X but dont use sudo. i beleive last time i tried sudo startx starts X in sudo mode
[10:47] <simo1> i dont think my swap partition is working properly - parted doesnt recognize any of my partitions, nor does qtparted.  looking at my partition table on fdisk shows my swap partition and a vfat partition having the same id - could this be the source of the problem?
[10:47] <echosystm> ok
[10:47] <echosystm> so
[10:47] <z9999> desrt: Sorry we took so long to reply, but just want to let you know we have got the repositories to work now after removing the "th." from the beginning of each repository in the sources.list file in /etc.  Thank you.
[10:47] <echosystm> i dont need xdm ro use blackbox?
[10:47] <gnomefreak> no
[10:47] <ColonelZarkawi> simo1, which id?
[10:47] <crimsun> echosystm: correct. I said so a while ago. :)
[10:48] <echosystm> ok lol
[10:48] <echosystm> so just typing startx
[10:48] <echosystm> would load x
[10:48] <echosystm> with blackbox
[10:48] <echosystm> ?
[10:48] <gnomefreak> should
[10:48] <echosystm> ok
[10:48] <echosystm> :D
[10:48] <ColonelZarkawi> simo1, a linux swap partition should be id 82
[10:48] <echosystm> thanks!!!!!!
[10:48] <eloquence_> Can somebody help with a problem installing ipw3945: http://pastebin.ca/273986 .. Here's some other info that might help http://pastebin.ca/273986 > http://pastebin.ca/273992
[10:49] <Storkme> crimsun, that worked perfectly. i removed nvidia-kernel-common and all its dependencies, now my pc boots fine using latest drivers :)
[10:49] <maxsof2> hi all. how to set protocoll to 802.11g from 802.11b on my wireless adapter?
[10:50] <Jeffm515_> do you have a B/G card?
[10:50] <jw_606> :(
[10:51] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: I cant find a compaq 26020 on google, what kind of machine is it? (cpu ram hardisk)
[10:51] <crimsun> echosystm: no, invoking ``startx'' does not exec blackbox automatically. You need to configure ~/.xinitrc to exec blackbox.
[10:51] <echosystm> ok
[10:52] <simo1> actually i think i was mistaken - it says the swap has id 82, and two vfat partitions have id b
[10:52] <echosystm> cool
[10:52] <echosystm> thakyou! :D
[10:52] <ColonelZarkawi> simo1, does your swap work?
[10:52] <Jeffm515_> S6020
[10:53] <dav085> hi can anyone help me, im trying to follow one of the guides on ubuntu documentation to install my windows driver through ndiswrapper and it keeps saying invalid directory :S
[10:53] <Jeffm515_> Compaq s6020wm 2.8 ghz celeron processor
[10:53] <dav085> it says to type sudo ndiswrapper -i ~Desktop/"drivername.inf"
[10:53] <Jeffm515_> 256 MB DDR SDRAM
[10:53] <dav085> and i replace drivername with my driver name and no quotations and my driver file is on the desktop :S
[10:53] <simo1> i dont think so - i run an algebra program which requires a lot of memory and it crashes when ever it requires more memory than my ram and says it is out of virtual memory
[10:54] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| sorry...
[10:54] <Surge_> Can someone recommend a firewall for Dapper? I've used iptables in the past but the interface can be a bit of a pain to work with.
[10:54] <ColonelZarkawi> simo1, when you run top, swap is reported?
[10:55] <crimsun> Surge_: firestarter? shorewall?
[10:55] <kane77> i'm trying to build wine from sources but when I try running ./configure I get this error message:configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[10:55] <ColonelZarkawi> !build-essential
[10:55] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[10:55] <crimsun> kane77: apt-get build-dep wine
[10:55] <simo1> i have not run top - shall i do that?
[10:55] <kane77> crimsun, i did that..
[10:55] <crimsun> kane77: and build-essential is also installed?
[10:55] <ColonelZarkawi> Kanafani, install build-essential package
[10:55] <ColonelZarkawi> kane77,
[10:56] <kane77> ColonelZarkawi, crimsun, yes
[10:56] <kane77> ColonelZarkawi, crimsun, already installed
[10:56] <crimsun> kane77: apt-get --reinstall install build-essential
[10:57] <kane77> crimsun, trying that right now
[10:57] <ColonelZarkawi> kane77, if everything else fails could you pastebin the config.log file? you should have a config.log file in the directory you ran configure
[10:57] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: hmmm, it should _just_ boot and work, no idea what is going on.
[10:57] <simo1> in top, there is a kswapd0 reported
[10:58] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: and because you cannot say _where_ the reboot happens, it is hard to say what is causing it ....
[10:58] <edgy> Hi, how can I show  a progress bar while I do cp in a terminal so I know the time left?
[10:58] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| yeah, it's just on any options given.. it loads the linux kernel to 100% - and just powercycles.
[10:59] <simo1> oh sorry, at the top it says 393MB of swap in total - my swap partition should be 1GB
[10:59] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: the only thing left to try is to dissconnect anything not needed to install, (sound card, ..) and turn off things in the biios (onboard lan, usb , ...)
[10:59] <ColonelZarkawi> edgy, maybe you can try with the libterm-progressbar-perl package?
[10:59] <Jeffm515_> everythings onboard
[10:59] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: have you tried the memtest?
[11:00] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: onbaord things, can be disabled in the bios
[11:00] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| yea, even that causes it to reboot, and it did the same thing when I installed 5.06,
[11:00] <Surge_> crimsun: Ta
[11:00] <ColonelZarkawi> edgy, the description of the package says " Linear estimation of the time left for the process to run is available." so probably is what you are looking for
[11:00] <ColonelZarkawi> simo1, hmm yes that could be the problem that not all swap is recognize. swap >1GB should not be any problem
[11:00] <HuibertG1ll> Jeffm515_: (sweep statement) if memetest is not working, your hardwre is broken
[11:01] <kane77> ColonelZarkawi, crimsun,  I reinstalled but still get the same error message... here's the paste of config.log: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36226/
[11:01] <Jeffm515_> HuibertG1|| I've gotta disagree.. because it did the same thing on a previous install...  I just can't remember what was done to bypass a test..

[11:14] <crimsun> FunnyMan3595: don't bug the developers in -kernel.
[11:14] <FunnyMan3595> Thought so.
[11:14] <crimsun> namely because we're mostly asleep.
[11:14] <FunnyMan3595> I can understand that.  No idea what's got me awake.
[11:15] <jw_606> crimsun so I need to install 7.0.0-8.25.18+2.6.15.12-1?
[11:15] <FunnyMan3595> Fortunately, what I'm trying to do shouldn't be all that hard.... shouldn't.
[11:15] <freakytux> biskvitka: which compiler do you use?
[11:15] <Tmob> anyone here use obexfs or fuse?
[11:15] <x80> zomg pubuntu
[11:15] <Tmob> i can't access a mounted file as user
[11:15] <Tmob> only as root...
[11:15] <crimsun> jw_606: ``sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx-control'' should have done it.
[11:15] <WAYNE_SHINE> Who can help me ~~~ My notebook have no voice.......
[11:15] <avis> is fuse a component of ntfs gs ?
[11:15] <Tmob> how would i get around this??
[11:16] <FunnyMan3595> I'm trying to add a module-defined system call, for a CS assignment.  Shouldn't be that hard... once I've got the kernel working.
[11:16] <jw_606> crimsun, it errors "E: The package xorg-driver-fglrx needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
[11:16] <jw_606> "
[11:16] <heikki> avis: ntfs-3g uses fuse
[11:16] <avis> ahh ok
[11:16] <crimsun> jw_606: reenable the restricted component.

[11:19] <crimsun> FunnyMan3595: any reason you're not using vanilla (kernel.org) 2.6.19?
[11:19] <pvandewyngaerde> gnomefreak: nvidia-glx_1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1_i386.deb
[11:20] <gnomefreak> pvandewyngaerde: did you change your driver to nvidia instead of nv?
[11:20] <crimsun> FunnyMan3595: 2.6.19-git is in deep churn; it'd be unwise to try "2.6.20".
[11:20] <WAYNE_SHINE> NO body help.....SOS
[11:20] <FunnyMan3595> Mainly because I was trying to find something that'd be compatible with all the other gunk that makes the system work.  At bare bones, all the extras I'd need are my network card and a working insmod.
[11:21] <avis> when did 2.6.19 become available ?

[11:25] <jw_606> I have downloaded "xorg-driver-fglrx_7.0.0-8.25.18+2.6.15.12-1_i386.deb" double clicked it and it tells me it cannot install because a later version is already installed, but I think the later version is broken

[11:25] <abimanyu_> hello..small help
[11:25] <crimsun> jw_606: so remove the later version. And why are you downloading the debs manually instead of using Synaptic/apt-get/aptitude/Adept?
[11:26] <abimanyu_> how to change folder permission
[11:26] <FunnyMan3595> Hmm, if I match my currently installed kernel, should I be able to get the old initrd image to work without having to rebuild it myself?
[11:26] <crimsun> FunnyMan3595: no
[11:26] <jw_606> crimsun, how do I remove the later version?
[11:26] <gnomefreak> pvandewyngaerde: change it to read PCI:4:00:0
[11:26] <FunnyMan3595> Drat.  Ah, well, was worth a thought.
[11:26] <crimsun> FunnyMan3595: meaning: it -may- work, but there's no guarantee.
[11:26] <abimanyu_> i nid to change folder permission

[11:55] <nicola> what's the corrispondent of "ipconfig" on linux ?
[11:55] <kane77> is there a way to view packages that has been installed today?? I installeda a lot of packages (to solve dependency), but I realised I dont want them... (and I'm running low on disk space)
[11:55] <crimsun> ifconfig
[11:55] <tonyyarusso> nicola: ifconfig
[11:55] <nicola> thanks
[11:55] <xitrox> thank you. and why is a "default sound card" to chose in the ubuntu sound-control if it doesn't work!? :/
[11:55] <Condorcet> mural1, it's a program, linux is a kernel
[11:55] <crimsun> xitrox: blame gconf.
[11:55] <xitrox> :)
[11:55] <Condorcet> so it depends on distribution u use, anyways, u can always install ncurses if its not there
[11:56] <Elglas> random question, why do my sound cards alternate between dsp and dsp1?
[11:56] <mural1> condercet:as in wat i mean to ask is,do the distros have them shipped?? or do we have to explicitly download them??
[11:56] <crimsun> Elglas: they don't alternate randomly, if that's what you're asking.
[11:56] <frogzoo> crimsun: all fixed - esd wasn't running - because I had a leftover ~/.asoundrc.asoundconf file

[11:57] <Elglas> ah but they do, sometimes by pci card is dsp, other times dsp1 swapping with my onboard, no hardware changes
[11:57] <kane77> or other question where are the cached packages kept?
[11:57] <blueyed> neno: have you tried installing the "apache2" package(s)?
[11:57] <blueyed> neno: you don't need to compile your own
[11:57] <crimsun> Elglas: you mean pci device enumeration, then, and not "dsp and dsp1 alternating randomly"
[11:57] <Condorcet> mural1, it depends on distro
[11:57] <neno> thanks, i'll try it
[11:58] <Condorcet> but well - if u have intenet connection whats the problem installing it
[11:58] <crimsun> Elglas: you can fix a certain ordering if you wish.  ``asoundconf list''
[11:58] <dim> can i share internet on lan

[12:04] <mangkuk> i just installed ubuntu, wonder if ubuntu can support kde? anyone
[12:04] <Condorcet> yes mangkuk

[12:15] <DTGorm> morning everyone
[12:15] <cornelius> hello
[12:15] <babar> morning
[12:15] <DTGorm> hey, anyone know the name of the torrent tracker most popular sites use? I thought it was BT Tracker but i cant find squat about it
[12:16] <jw_606> Hello
[12:16] <DTGorm> i have tried torrenttrader and btitracker and none of them are good
[12:16] <J-_> I don't understand why I can't create a logical drive, I have a ntfs partition which is primary and windows is installed already, i also created an ext3 partition, now when I go to make either a swap or fat32 logical partition, it doesn't work, please help...
[12:16] <DTGorm> what are you making the partitions with?
[12:17] <power83> hi
[12:17] <DTGorm> hi
[12:17] <Elglas> I always found creating primary drives (as opposed to logical) a more friendly process
[12:17] <power83> i'm  installing ubuntu
[12:17] <frogzoo> J-_: you've tried fdisk?
[12:17] <Elglas> err. partitions
[12:17] <power83> I've some trouble with partitions and filesystem
=== xstream_ is now known as xStream
[12:17] <jw_606> I'm on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 6.06, how do I install the drivers for my ATI Radeon 9800 pro video card?
[12:17] <frogzoo> power83: more info pls
[12:17] <power83> Is it possible to use  reiserfs filesystem instead ext3?
[12:18] <frogzoo> !fglrx | jw_606
[12:18] <ubotu> jw_606: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:18] <Elglas> power83: yes, I do it on my recording box
[12:18] <echosystm> what does ~/ mean?
[12:18] <echosystm> in relation to a directory
[12:18] <DTGorm> J= if you are trying to do dual boot, then use partitionmagic and make free space a new partition, or like whatever amount of free space you need a new partition and dont format it, then run the linux disk and allow it to partition the unpartitioned space for linux use
[12:18] <echosystm> its somthing to do witht the home directory right?
[12:18] <frogzoo> power83: sure, but unless you have very special needs, there's little point
[12:18] <echosystm> is it /home/ ? or /home/username/ ?
=== my_haz is now known as firstpua
[12:19] <frogzoo> echosystm: homedir is /home/user
[12:19] <power83> I've experienced in this and past yeasr some crash of ext3
[12:19] <echosystm> ok so ~/.blah = /home/user/.blah
[12:19] <echosystm> ?
[12:19] <frogzoo> power83: then don't turn off your power while youre writing to the fs
[12:19] <Elglas> power83: however seeing as resier was recently arrested, the future of the filesystem seems interesting
[12:19] <power83> But....with gparted during graphical installation,  how I choose reiserfs?
[12:19] <frogzoo> echosystm: yep
[12:19] <J-_> frogzoo: no i haven't
[12:19] <echosystm> thankyou :D
[12:19] <J-_> DTGorm: okay
[12:20] <frogzoo> J-_: try with fdisk
[12:20] <derFlo> where can i find the wine-config file? i could not find it in ~/.wine/config ..
[12:20] <rouan> soz to bug again.. anyone know why my lan transfer speed is slow? (2mb/sec in and outgoing is fast)
[12:20] <exeakiel> Umm, I'm using Dapper Drake 6.06, and I want to upgrade to 6.10, but after looking throught this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - It doesn't display any upgrades.
[12:20] <frogzoo> derFlo: there is no .winecfg any more - just run winecfg
[12:20] <rouan> this is over samba, duno if nfs is slow too
[12:21] <derFlo> frogzoo: wanna run a game in fullscreen mode
[12:21] <exeakiel> And I clearly have an internet connection, broadband too.
[12:21] <FunnyMan3595> Owwww....  I managed to corrupt my grub config file.  Took me a little while to fix that mistake.
[12:21] <rouan> exeakiel, fresh install is easiest
[12:21] <derFlo> frogzoo: so i have to edit the cfg file, i read in some boards
[12:21] <jerb_> edgy is a little buggy
[12:21] <rouan> just keep /home on a seperate partiion
[12:21] <DTGorm> so.... anyone know what the popular bit torrent tracker program is called?
[12:21] <biskvitka> Hi help plssss configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[12:21] <ColonelZarkawi> jerb_, right
[12:21] <DTGorm> is it BT Tracker?
[12:21] <exeakiel> So I've heard.
[12:22] <frogzoo> jerb_: which bugs?
[12:22] <biskvitka> Hi HELP  plssss configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[12:22] <exeakiel> After installing Envy, how do I use it?
[12:22] <frogzoo> DTGorm: azureus pretty popular
[12:22] <power83> IMPORTANT:
[12:22] <ColonelZarkawi> frogzoo, lots, lots of them. check the bug tracker,
[12:22] <atlef> derFlo : in terminal : winecfg
[12:22] <DTGorm> frogzoo, no not the client.. the tracker itself
[12:22] <jerb_> can't restart,  can only shut down
[12:22] <J-_> i find opera is pretty good for torrents heh
[12:22] <frogzoo> ColonelZarkawi: yeh, new bugs instead of the old, but I'm hoping edgy's more stable than dapper
[12:23] <ColonelZarkawi> frogzoo, it isn't
[12:23] <DTGorm> lol, *SLAPS EVERYONE*
[12:23] <frogzoo> ColonelZarkawi: oh noes
[12:23] <DTGorm> tracker, not client
[12:23] <DTGorm> lol
[12:23] <exeakiel> Anyone?
[12:23] <ColonelZarkawi> frogzoo, if you want stability dapper is far more stable than edgy.
[12:23] <QwertyM> whaz envy ?
[12:23] <frogzoo> ColonelZarkawi: cept suspend works now, so upgrade has justified itself
[12:24] <ColonelZarkawi> frogzoo, I am glad it worked in your case

[12:45] <bigbro> babar: Boot off it - everything else becomes obvious from that point onwards.
[12:45] <babar> tonyyarusso: What is this netisntall? You mean type this at the boot prompt.
[12:45] <bigbro> babar: You can install a complete Ubuntu system from the internet using it.
[12:45] <bigbro> babar: And the initial download is something like 8.4MB.
[12:46] <babar> Nah I dont want to do it via install but via local network

[12:46] <babar> I have copied the extracted on a pc on my local network
[12:46] <babar> i want to install rest of the computers from there
[12:47] <bigbro> babar: Ah - I'e not done that with Ubuntu, but many other distros support a local install. I suspect it's relatively easy to configure the mini.iso to grab fles from a local mirror of an apt repository.
[12:47] <J-_> I've just dual booted my system with ntfs and ext3 filesystems, can I resize my ext3 partition and create a fat32 partition with gparted?
[12:47] <babar> I have done it before with fedora
[12:47] <babar> it has a netboot image
[12:47] <babar> u can then install it from a nfs/http/ftp server by just providing the ip and path
[12:47] <bigbro> babar: You'll need to look up how to set up a local apt repository / apt cache. Then it's probably as easy as configuring sources.list - though you may want to make another ISO image to make that change permanent and available for use on mutliple machines.
[12:48] <HuibertGill> babar: look into apt-on-cd
[12:48] <bigbro> babar: Yes - Ubuntu also supports that - but as I said, you have to set up your local mirror. Ubuntu makes things easier by removing choices that the 'average' user would not want.

[12:55] <hjmills> one,  check out System>preferences>sessions if you want it to start when u login to gnome
[12:55] <eilker> hjmills: for kde ?
[12:55] <ZeuGiRDoR> how can i sort kmenu alphabetically?
[12:55] <viller> if I want to remove something from starting up when I start my comp (like apache or something), I'll just delete the script from /etc/init.d?
[12:55] <hjmills> eilker, i think if you look in ~/.kde there is an autostart folder so link it in there
[12:56] <drach> viller: no, use update-rc.d
[12:56] <hjmills> eilker, it may be ~/kde-3.5 or somthing
[12:56] <viller> drach: how?
[12:56] <manmadha> anuragJ, one person is disturbing the chanal

[12:58] <Paolo> ...salve...a chi posso chiedere help sull'installazione di ubuntu???
[12:58] <drach> viller: you can also look at system menu -> administration->services
[12:58] <hjmills> eilker, i find the best way to find stuff on linux is to open a term and use "sudo updatedb" then use locate and grep to find stuff
[12:59] <eilker> hjmills: i used as locate kde, but there are many...
[12:59] <biskvitka> Hi can someone tell me how can i install wine????
[12:59] <eilker> !wine
[12:59] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[12:59] <hjmills> eilker, try locate kde | grep autostart (it may be AutoStart or Autostart, Im not sure)
[01:00] <biskvitka> 10x
[01:00] <echosystm> um
[01:00] <echosystm> when i apt-get install synaptics
[01:00] <echosystm> it says
[01:01] <echosystm> package synaptics is not availabile
[01:01] <echosystm> but is referred to by another package.
[01:01] <echosystm> ??? :S
[01:01] <cafuego_> synaptic
[01:01] <HuibertGill> biskvitka: why would you want to install wine 10 times? just install wine with  synaptic
[01:01] <drach> echosystm: synaptic not synaptics
[01:01] <cafuego_> don't make up names, use real ones ;-)
[01:01] <echosystm> ahaha
[01:01] <echosystm> god
[01:01] <echosystm> i must be half asleep
[01:02] <echosystm> thanks :P
[01:02] <eilker> hjmills: it gives as result, /usr/share/autostart/kdesktop.desktop
[01:02] <exeakiel> How do I get Xubuntu onto a proprietary machine?
[01:02] <exeakiel> Dell
[01:03] <exeakiel> Demension 2400
[01:03] <hjmills> eilker, ok, open that file in kate and look at the format
[01:03] <hjmills> exeakiel, install it normally :
[01:03] <hjmills> :D
[01:03] <exeakiel> I've tried
[01:03] <exeakiel> Boots from disc, then says it can read.] 
[01:03] <hjmills> eilker, then make new files in that autostart dir for the stuff you want to start
[01:03] <exeakiel> D.
[01:03] <hjmills> exeakiel, is it driver problems? try searching ubuntuforums.org for people with the same machine
[01:03] <wrathchild9> when I write sudo command, it writes sudo: unable to lookup fender via gethostbyname()
[01:04] <eilker> hjmills: this file does not have what we r looking for, it has some descriptions for languages
[01:04] <JustNew> hi people. i've just downloaded a BIN file Aptana_IDE_Setup.bin. How do I install this
[01:04] <wrathchild9> what I can do?
[01:04] <Allz> LjL are you here?
[01:04] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: is fender your hostname?
[01:04] <wrathchild9> yes
[01:05] <hjmills> eilker, http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Autostart_Programs
[01:05] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: do you have an entry in /etc/hosts for it?
[01:05] <wrathchild9> no
[01:05] <eilker> hjmills: thank you
[01:05] <exeakiel> Thanks, hgmills!
[01:05] <wrathchild9> is there localhost and old hostname
[01:05] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: then add the following line to /etc/hosts:
[01:06] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: 127.0.0.1       fender fender
[01:06] <hjmills> eilker, exeakiel, sure :)
[01:06] <JustNew> whats a nice dreamweaver-like editor for Ubuntu>?
[01:06] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: the system knows your hostname is fender, but has not found the ip for it.
[01:06] <wrathchild9> thanks
[01:06] <HeathenDan> nvu
[01:06] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: adding it to /etc/hosts tells the system the ip is 127.0.0.1 also known as localhost
[01:06] <eilker> hjmills: now done, /home/user/.kde/Autostart :)
[01:07] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: leave the localhost definitions as they are, a hosts can have multiple names
[01:07] <wrathchild9> but the old name is in 127.0.1.1
[01:07] <wrathchild9> and localhost is 127.0.0.1
[01:07] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: 127.0.1.1 is a very odd ip for a local host....
[01:08] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: how did it get there?
[01:09] <exeakiel> Can someone help me find the text-based Xubuntu cd?
[01:09] <Condorcet> ??
[01:09] <Condorcet> text based ubuntu?
[01:09] <Condorcet> what the heck?
[01:10] <Kyle__> You mean only the console vs. a gui?
[01:10] <Condorcet> what for?
[01:10] <wrathchild9> but when I had hostname jackson, 127.0.1.1 was good
[01:10] <Condorcet> and why do u need xubuntu specifically for this
[01:10] <tonyyarusso> exeakiel: Text-only installer, or installed system?
[01:10] <_osh> There's a command to echo somewhere in /proc to increase the speed of raid-mirroring. Anyone know what it is? Or rather where.
[01:10] <atlef> exeakiel : http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/6.10/release/
[01:11] <atlef> the alternate one
[01:11] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: is the hostanme jackson in your /etc/hosts
[01:11] <Condorcet> atlef, i doubt if the installation is text-based
[01:11] <tonyyarusso> Condorcet: It is.
[01:11] <Condorcet> ok
[01:11] <tonyyarusso> Pretty ncurses menus actually
[01:11] <Condorcet> sweet
[01:12] <exeakiel> Thanks, atlef, looks like I'll be up pretty late! D:
[01:12] <wrathchild9> yes
[01:12] <atlef> your welcome
[01:12] <ubuntu_> hrjka weryariu
[01:12] <wrathchild9> but now hostname is fender in my /etc/hostname
[01:12] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: then just add the line for fender, you should be fine
[01:12] <atlef> you're
[01:12] <atlef> *
[01:13] <wrathchild9> ok, thanks
[01:13] <wrathchild9> and what I must restart in /etc/init.d ?

[01:15] <ajopaul_> how to disable the dosfsck checks everytime on a bootup?

[01:17] <cornelius> hi, when starting office2000 with wine an error acours saying that office was not installed for that user. Does somebody knows how to fix?
[01:17] <_osh> exeakiel: I'd say it's ok if it has to do with getting windows and linux to play together.

[01:23] <jrib> cornelius: have you tried wine's app database?
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[01:24] <cornelius> jrib: what you mean by this? i could install it. it starts, but then it closes again saying that office was not installed for the current user.
[01:24] <funnyman3595> Okay, I think I've almost got the kernel working.  Only problem is that it's complaining about my test module.  "unresolved symbol printk" and "unresolved symbol sys_call_table"  (2.4)

[01:29] <NANOskejoe> Hi! I wanted to try another dist, so i installed it on other partitions than ubuntu, by i also overwrote the bootloader, so now i want to delete the other dist but the GRUB is screwing when i does :S

[01:29] <NANOskejoe> how do I reinstall my bootloader ?
[01:30] <HymnToLife> Zaggynl, then you'll have to compile it, only 1.4.3 is available for Dapper
[01:30] <Deadmeat> Which is the easiest and fastest way to see if a application is running/online?

[01:32] <digiqq_> ollekalle: did u enable DHCP on your machine?
[01:32] <cornelius> jrib: checked this. I did not find my error on this side. I think the problem is that the user folder with application settings is missing. setup did not install it. Thanx for your help.
[01:32] <jrib> Waerner: you can pass your own arguments to ps
[01:32] <sith-lord> Hello
[01:32] <Briar3os> Hello.
[01:32] <Waerner> jrib, okay, I'll check it out, thanks =)

[01:34] <_osh> Briar3os: It means that you're looking in the wrong place.
[01:34] <_osh> Briar3os: do a "locate unrar" to see where it is.
[01:34] <babar> Guys is it possible to install ubuntu dapper without going into the live session?
[01:35] <jrib> babar: yes, with the alternate cd

[01:35] <my_haz> Briar3os: i use zsh as my shell

[01:35] <babar> jrib: With the alternate CD ie its a differenet CD?
[01:35] <Briar3os> To be more precise, I'm trying to use Ark to unpack things...
[01:36] <jrib> !alternate | babar
[01:36] <ubotu> babar: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.

=== bierwoller is now known as aristot
[01:40] <jrib> Briar3os: unrar-nonfree
[01:40] <mypapit> jrib: because rarsoft updates their rar compression algorithm?

[01:41] <jrib> mypapit: yeah, unrar-free doesn't handle whatever their latest version is, so it's pretty useless
[01:41] <aristoteles> is is possible to deactivate the shortcut f1 for the help?
[01:41] <Briar3os> So, what's the difference with nonfree? Commercial?
[01:42] <my_haz> Briar3os: the commercial is close source
[01:42] <cornelius> jrib: thanx again. i will try this.
[01:42] <my_haz> Briar3os: rar is free-as-in-beer

[01:42] <my_haz> Briar3os: you are new to the whole open source seen i take it :D
[01:42] <Briar3os> This is just a temporary thing...
[01:43] <my_haz> Briar3os: sudo apt-get install rar && rar x mypr0n.rar
[01:43] <aristoteles> deleting the shortcut in that shortcuts wizard won't help, that's why i'm asking.

[01:58] <Zho> anybody can help me how to restore my GRUB?
[01:58] <jrib> ColonelZarkawi: I assume, "paste" means copy and paste
[01:59] <ColonelZarkawi> jrib, really?
[01:59] <apokryphos> Zho: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[01:59] <A3n> paste means pasting the hex of the file in standard output

[02:00] <A3n> i want to copy a file to a dir but i cant do it with GUI because i'm not root in gui, in terminal i su myself
[02:00] <rastilin> So?
[02:00] <BlindVirus> any one have any idea on where to go to look for ideas on how to fix the missing shut down button in the menu?
[02:00] <zelevw> a3n: gksudo nautilus
[02:00] <rastilin> A3n, forgive me for asking but what does this have to do with the hex being printed to standard output?
[02:00] <Zho> apokryphos: I think there is no boot:rescue in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
[02:00] <Zho> ?
[02:01] <A3n> "paste" command in terminal
[02:01] <ColonelZarkawi> what is the "hex of a file"?
[02:01] <jrib> A3n: yes, use the cp command.  cp /old/path/to/file /new/path/to/file
[02:01] <Chris_H> i'm trying to ween myself over to Ubuntu, so I partitioned the drive and i have a menu on startup to ask me which OS i want to boot (linux did that bit for me) but is there a way to set Windows XP as the default OS for the time being?
[02:01] <ColonelZarkawi> jrib, will not work if he hasn't the rights on the new path
[02:01] <rastilin> Chris_H, Yes. Just edit the grub.conf file and set the sequence to what you want.
[02:01] <jrib> ColonelZarkawi: right
[02:02] <rastilin> ColonelZarkawi, but he has sudo
[02:02] <ColonelZarkawi> so?
[02:02] <Chris_H> where would i find that rastilin?
[02:02] <Chris_H> im a bit of a newbie with linux
[02:02] <Chris_H> hence why i partitioned the hard drive to try and make it a gradual move
[02:02] <rastilin> Chris_H, where's your boot partition, probably under /boot/grub
[02:02] <Chris_H> im not sure
[02:02] <Chris_H> i could check and get back to you
[02:03] <ollekalle2> Could someone try to help me to get my eth0 up and running?
[02:03] <Chris_H> trouble is, i still have to buy a non-USB ADSL modem before the Linux OS can become internet ready
[02:03] <rastilin> Chris_H, unless it's for games, it's easier if you just jump in. It's painful at first but it ends quicker. Plus, you actually switch instead of waffling for months before giving up.
[02:03] <Zaggynl> What's an easy way to mount images except the script to mount iso files and except cdemu?
=== JaeSharp is now known as JaeSharpWork
[02:03] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, ifup eth
[02:03] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, ifup eth0
[02:03] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, sudo ifup eth0
[02:03] <rastilin> Zaggynl, The mount command can mount images if you add "-o loop"
[02:03] <Chris_H> rastilin: i'd consider it, but my mum uses the computer too and she's a technophobe at the best of times
[02:04] <Zaggynl> rastilin, can I mount bin files too?
[02:04] <ollekalle2> ColonelZarkawi: already up and running
[02:04] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, sudo /etc/init.d/networking start
[02:04] <ColonelZarkawi> so?
[02:04] <rastilin> Chris_H. Well you know you could set her user account to use a windows-like window manager.
[02:04] <ollekalle2> ColonelZarkawi: no error message from /etc/init.d/networking start
[02:05] <Chris_H> yeah, but she'd still need all her outlook contacts, emails, boomarks and other settings transferred over
[02:05] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, and /sbin/ifconfig shows your interface up and running?
[02:05] <rastilin> Zaggynl, not directly but if you rename the .bin to .iso, most files mount fine.
[02:05] <Chris_H> i already told her about it, and she said: "if you want to try it then fine, but dont make me use it until EVERYTHING'S set up on there"
[02:06] <exeakiel> Is there any way to play Diablo on Ubuntu?
[02:06] <exeakiel> With Wine?
[02:06] <rastilin> exeakiel, yes, with wine
[02:06] <ollekalle2> ColonelZarkawi: "up and runing". its in the list but no assigned IP. dhclient eth0 times out
[02:06] <exeakiel> How?
[02:06] <rastilin> exeakiel, it's complicated, do you have wine?
[02:06] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, probably a problem with the dhcp configuration or server
[02:06] <exeakiel> It says I need the disc, but it's there.
[02:06] <exeakiel> I do indeed have Wine.
[02:06] <rastilin> exeakiel, it's in the drive and the game's installed?
[02:07] <exeakiel> Yes.
[02:07] <rajiv_nair> bye guys

[02:08] <rastilin> Chris_H, why not?
[02:08] <jhaquo> hi
[02:08] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, unfortunately I don't use dchp anymore but probably you could recheck your /etc/dhclient.conf file
[02:08] <manmadha> danny,
[02:08] <jhaquo> anyone knows how i could join WMV files to one big wmv file please?
[02:08] <wrathchild9> bye
[02:09] <ColonelZarkawi> jhaquo, with cat?
[02:09] <rastilin> Chris_H. I used to use gaim, now xchat. The registration is per username, not per client.
[02:09] <Chris_H> the only half decent IRC client i could find was Klient (for some reason, XChat kept saying i'd used my evaluation period as soon as it was installed)
[02:09] <jhaquo> cat makes a big file, but playing stops after the first file
[02:09] <ollekalle2> ColonelZarkawi: that file is not even ther :/ I'll try to create one...
[02:09] <rastilin> Chris_H. There's an evaluation period?
[02:09] <skyrunner> damm the guys at freedroid dont answer
[02:09] <Chris_H> that's what i thought ;)
=== Spee_Der is now known as Red_eeps
[02:09] <ColonelZarkawi> Chris_H, impossible, XChat is free, it doesn't expire after some time of use.
[02:09] <skyrunner> anyone of you guys knows how to install fredroidrpg in ubuntu?
[02:09] <Chris_H> i know
[02:10] <Chris_H> i think its a bug in the install
[02:10] <Chris_H> but as soon as i install it, at the end of the install it says "Run XChat Now" which i do, and it says "You've used your 30 days trial time, please register." or something to that effect
[02:10] <ColonelZarkawi> ollekalle2, read the dhclient.conf man page for details
[02:10] <skyrunner> it only expires if you download the latest version for windows
[02:10] <ColonelZarkawi> Chris_H, impossible, it must be another program not the x-chat that is used on linux systems
[02:11] <ESPOiG_> how do i get my usb printer set up
[02:11] <jhaquo> no ideas how??
=== Red_eeps is now known as Red_eeps_
[02:11] <rastilin> jhaquo, you need a program that can modify wma files.
[02:12] <gReg0r> hey guys, got a problem with the install of ubuntu edgy (6.10) after starting the live sys of desktop installation and running the installation, the system gives me following error before showing up the bootscreen : "PCI: cannot allocate resource region 1 of device ..." this occours since then, even after deleting the partition table of the hard drive the only live sys booting is knoppix
[02:12] <rastilin> Then stitch them together.
[02:12] <gReg0r> how can i solve the prob?
[02:12] <A3n> is there some alternative to windows media player in ubuntu? cause VLC doesnt have mush options
[02:12] <jhaquo> rastilin a sugestion on which i should use?
[02:12] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, mplayer
[02:12] <A3n> isnt that for movies only ColonelZarkawi ?
[02:12] <rastilin> A3n, windows media player in ubuntu?
[02:12] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, eee no
[02:12] <jrib> A3n: what options are missing from vlc?
[02:12] <Chris_H> skyrunner: thats what im using
[02:12] <Zaggynl> Is the only easy way to mount images by using vmware + winxp + daemon tools? :-(
[02:12] <rastilin> jhaquo, I'd be suprised if any exist
[02:13] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, you can play mp3 files with it if you wish
[02:13] <skyrunner> thats why
[02:13] <Chris_H> im still on windows at the moment, until i get a non-USB ADSL modem and i can get Linux online
[02:13] <skyrunner> oh
[02:13] <richee> !s
[02:13] <skyrunner> thats your problem then
[02:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about s - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:13] <A3n> Well i cant make playlists, i cant choose the order the files i put in to come
[02:13] <skyrunner> when you get to linux if its not by default on applications
[02:13] <A3n> i cant choose repeat
[02:13] <A3n> i cant choose random
[02:13] <skyrunner> just run terminal and sudo aptitude install xchat
[02:13] <skyrunner> and thats that
[02:13] <ColonelZarkawi> ?
[02:14] <A3n> random song from list
[02:14] <A3n> randomize list
[02:14] <rastilin> A3n, we get it
[02:14] <A3n> k :p
[02:14] <zigford> goodnight
=== Red_eeps_ is now known as Red_eeps
[02:14] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, for music, mplayer is not the right program.
[02:14] <rastilin> A3n, if it's just for music why not use Rhythmbox or Amarok
[02:14] <A3n> could wmp work with wine ?
[02:14] <jrib> A3n: that's "shuffle" and "repeat" is also in the playlist option
[02:14] <Red_eeps> Cool beans
[02:14] <exeakiel> Can someone help me with Envy?
[02:14] <javaJake> A3n, highly unlikely.
[02:14] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, there is no program which has music+video functionality as windows media player
[02:14] <rastilin> A3n, Yes, although I can't imagine why you'd immediately go running back to windows
[02:15] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, for music you can use amarok or rhythmbox

[02:15] <javaJake> Will Xorg auto-detect my monitors Hsync rates and all that if I don't define them???
[02:15] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, or beep-media-player (less functionality)
[02:15] <rastilin> Or Movie player which comes with Ubuntu
[02:15] <rastilin> javaJake, Yes
[02:15] <exeakiel> Can anyone help me with Envy?
[02:15] <ColonelZarkawi> envy?
[02:15] <javaJake> rastilin, ok, I've got a projector, and I don't know what those rates are. The manual never mentions them, so I hope X can figure it out. :P

[02:16] <rastilin> javaJake, does it not work?
[02:16] <javaJake> rastilin, does a projector even have refresh rates?
[02:16] <solid_liq> does anyone know of premade intel 3945AG wireless driver packages for dapper?
[02:16] <exeakiel> I have no clue how to even run it.
[02:16] <rastilin> javaJake, I'm assuming yes
[02:16] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, use amarok then
[02:16] <javaJake> rastilin, oh, Xinerama works, just don't want to blow the projector.
[02:16] <javaJake> :P
[02:16] <A3n> can amarok do that?
[02:16] <javaJake> A3n, yes
[02:16] <rastilin> A3n, yes
[02:16] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, sure, music files only not videos
[02:16] <javaJake> A3n, Rythmbox can too
[02:16] <javaJake> A3n, which is preinstalled
[02:17] <A3n> yea well i dont want to randomize videos lol
[02:17] <javaJake> heheh
[02:17] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, ok
[02:17] <A3n> rythlbox is ugly
[02:17] <A3n> rythmbox * and it couldnt run my mp3's
[02:17] <javaJake> A3n, GTK IS UGLY!?!?!? ;)
[02:17] <ColonelZarkawi> A3n, amarok is better than rhythmbox, try it
[02:17] <rastilin> A3n, you need the codecs for mp3
[02:17] <ColonelZarkawi> yes gtk is damn fugly
[02:17] <javaJake> A3n, ah, well, the codecs are needed
[02:17] <orly> hy

[02:22] <richee> ?
[02:22] <ColonelZarkawi> yes opera randers faster than firefox
[02:22] <ColonelZarkawi> opera is the faster browser available
[02:22] <javaJake> richee, yea
[02:22] <ColonelZarkawi> renders
[02:22] <TheGateKeeper> javaJake, then use the repo search engine that comes pre-installed with FF
[02:22] <javaJake> richee, anything that can run 3D acell basically can.
[02:22] <javaJake> TheGateKeeper, heh, well, it's easier to do it here. (lazy me)
[02:22] <richee> javaJake: ok....They why does automatix bleeder tell beryl is not supported

[02:23] <A3n> VLC music quality is better than in windows, imo
[02:23] <A3n> than with wmp

[02:23] <richee> What the difference between beryl and compiz manager
[02:23] <richee> I am kinda confused
[02:24] <javaJake> richee, beryl's new and wild, with more features, compiz is stable but doesn't have as much good stuff. Personally, I've been super happy with Beryl.
[02:24] <A3n> richee: 6 letters
[02:24] <javaJake> richee, yea, it is confusing
[02:24] <javaJake> richee, then there's XGL and AiGLX. :P
[02:24] <Teri2007> I have apache2 installed, and can't figure out why I get a directory listing instead of seeing my index.html page, when I browse to it with firefox.
[02:24] <richee> javaJake: that's even more confusing :D
[02:24] <Spee_Der> Hmmm
[02:25] <javaJake> richee, XGL is for NVidia cards only. AiGLX is for everyone else, pretty much.
[02:25] <richee> javaJake: can u point me to a howto ont his
[02:25] <richee> javaJake: ok

[02:35] <aventiskhan> does ubuntu 6.10 automont windows partitions in dual boot wid xp?  anyone pls answer
[02:36] <jrib> aventiskhan: I think it detects them during install and adds them to /etc/fstab appropriately, but if it didn't you can add it yourself and they will automatically get automounted when you boot

[02:36] <rootroot> can u help me
[02:36] <hurrikam> hi guys
[02:36] <Answer> rootroot: ask a question
[02:36] <rootroot> okay
[02:36] <gelactiv> hi, i have a problem here with totem - it refuses to start when i have no sound card. what should i do to play videos when i have no sound card?\
[02:37] <ColonelZarkawi> gelactiv, totem-gstreamer?
[02:37] <PPAAUULL> Ok so I was installing the flgrx driver for my card like someone in here told me to and I get down to the part where it says to test it. when I do I get that mesa read out so I check if fglrx is running with "sudo modprobe fglrx" and the console says "FATAL: Error running install command for fglrx" and so when I search the "lsmod" command fglrx is not there. How can I fix it?
[02:37] <rootroot> how i can restor my user profile
[02:37] <Vixus> *sigh*
[02:37] <ColonelZarkawi> gelactiv, if you use totem-gstreamer, uninstall it, ASAP
[02:37] <A3n> TheGateKeeper: yup, and al the people i want to talk to have msn
[02:37] <A3n> or irc :p
[02:37] <ColonelZarkawi> gelactiv, totem-gstreamer is completly useless
[02:37] <nolimitsoya> PPAAUULL, a driver is not a command. edit your xorg.conf to switch driver
[02:37] <A3n> and irc is plugged in my opera browser with mail client too so horay for opera

[02:38] <hurrikam> I had a problem installing Apache 2.2.3 on Ubuntu Dapper x64. All ok, except the server doesn't start automatically at boot time. I tried to add a root script in init.d and all rc.Xd directories, having the same  command I use manually to start it ("/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start"). But nothing...
[02:38] <hurrikam> any help?
[02:38] <Zaggynl> How can I stop synaptic from stopping from hanging at 'Downloading package information'? Can I set the timeout value lower?
[02:38] <PPAAUULL> nolimitsoya that is the HowTo that I followed!!!!
[02:38] <rootroot> i can only log as a root
[02:39] <nolimitsoya> PPAAUULL, you never type fglrx in a terminal. look through it again
[02:39] <gelactiv> ColonelZarkawi: thanks, i'll try to remove it
[02:39] <jeyancad> Alguien tiene un calendario perpetuo (El codigo) para importarlo en una aplicacion.?

[02:39] <Answer> rootroot: undo whatever you did that broke your user profile
[02:39] <nolimitsoya> rootroot, what do you mean by root?
=== ryu2 is now known as ryu
[02:39] <hjmills> nolimitsoya, i have a local screen which i used to ssh into a remote pc and connected to a screen session on that remote machine - i want to detach the remote screen but ctrl+a, d just detaches the local screen
[02:39] <floating> there is a menu to control user and groups rootroot. Go look your user there, or make a new one
[02:39] <ColonelZarkawi> gelactiv, the first alternative is totem-xine
[02:40] <hurrikam> no suggestion for my little problem?
[02:40] <ColonelZarkawi> gelactiv, totem-xine should work out-of-the-box
[02:40] <PPAAUULL> nolimitsoya what do you mean I typed fglrxinfo
[02:40] <nolimitsoya> hjmills, hmm... im not _that_ familiar :P try man screen
[02:40] <Vixus> Slow video on Ubuntu... I think I may have to go back to Windows.
[02:40] <hjmills> nolimitsoya, ok, thanks
[02:40] <nolimitsoya> PPAAUULL, have you edited you xorg.conf and restarted x?
[02:40] <rootroot> okay if i make a new one how i can copy my old one profile in the new one
[02:40] <Answer> hurrikam: make sure all the paths are correct and at it to /etc/rc.local
[02:40] <woofer> Vixus : chrck your video settings
[02:40] <PPAAUULL> What am I supposed to edit it to look like
[02:40] <jrib> hjmills: you can detach screens with  screen -d screen.id.thingy
[02:40] <PPAAUULL> ?
[02:40] <rootroot> like backgound themes and soo on
[02:40] <woofer> check*
[02:40] <Answer> Vixus: check for better drivers for your video card
[02:41] <gelactiv> ColonelZarkawi: ok i'll try to replace it with totem-xine thanks!
[02:41] <floating> hjmills or nolimitsoya have experience on compiling a screen ?
[02:41] <hurrikam> Answer: that dir doesn't exists in etc
[02:41] <Vixus> Answer: NVidia?
[02:41] <nolimitsoya> Vixus, beryl and video playback is a nono. try not to use experimental software next time
[02:41] <hurrikam> should create it?
[02:41] <Answer> hurrikam: its a file /etc/rc.local
[02:41] <hurrikam> ah
[02:41] <ColonelZarkawi> you are welcome
[02:41] <hurrikam> ehm
[02:41] <hurrikam> eheh
[02:41] <hurrikam> joking XD
[02:41] <Vixus> nolimitsoya: Beryl has stopped working.
[02:41] <jrib> hjmills: why do you want to detach the remote screen by the way?
[02:41] <Answer> hurrikam: put the script you use to launch it manually in /etc/rc.local and that should run on boot
[02:41] <Vixus> nolimitsoya: Wait, I never used Beryl...
[02:41] <PPAAUULL> nolimitsoya, I followed the instructions here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI and it never said anything about editing the xorg config file.
[02:42] <PPAAUULL> Oh and yes I do have the "composite" thing disabled at the bottom.
[02:43] <hjmills> jrib, cos its on my server which i leave running to manage my torrents so i dont want to stop all my torrents by closing the screen
[02:43] <hjmills> jrib, but i do want to close the local screen session
[02:43] <echosystm> 0insa
[02:43] <Vixus> nolimitsoya: Video playback and Compiz worked a treat... but now Compiz won't run, Flash playback has always been out of sync with the sound, Totem plays DVDs skippily... Ubuntu never used to do this.
[02:43] <jrib> hjmills: I usually just use  screen -x  to open the session in more than one place and don't close any
[02:43] <hurrikam> rebooting. Thanks Answer... I'll see soon if it works...
[02:44] <Answer> Does anyone have trouble with logrotate crashing various programs?
[02:44] <hjmills> jrib, so if i closed my local screen would it automatically detach the remote screen?
[02:44] <jrib> hjmills: no
[02:45] <richee> wow! I installed beryl
[02:45] <richee> How can I get the desktop cube

[02:47] <Kyle__> this xchat i got from the package installer is odd
[02:47] <ColonelZarkawi> gizmo_the_great1, mp3 player detection should happen automatically no matter the linux player used
[02:47] <Kyle__> everythings located differently :x
[02:48] <jrib> Kyle__: did you get xchat-gnome instead of xchat?
[02:48] <Kyle__> yes
[02:48] <jrib> Kyle__: that's why
[02:48] <jengc0il> nalioth: hi there
[02:49] <Kyle__> it was the only xchat option in the package manager
[02:49] <gizmo_the_great1> ColonelZarkawi: thanks. Yes, it used to work b4, so unsure what problem is now. Yes, I have HAL - I thought that was installed with Ubuntu by default? And no I do not have pmount installed. I am currently downloading amarok as suggested ubotu

[02:49] <jrib> Kyle__: have you enabled universe?
[02:50] <ColonelZarkawi> gizmo_the_great1, ok, probably it will work without pmount. pmount advantage is: it will mount as user the devices without having a /etc/fstab entry or mounting them manually

[03:09] <jrib> wceoscar: see what ubotu said
[03:10] <ColonelZarkawi> doopsie, probably you don't need to install and reinstall again and over again. It could be a kernel problem. May I suggest you try with a vanilla kernel before giving up with ubuntu?
[03:10] <wceoscar> the prob is that i dont find nautilus
[03:10] <doopsie> whats a vanilla kernal?
[03:10] <doopsie> sorry, quite new to linux
[03:10] <ColonelZarkawi> doopsie, a kernel downloaded from kernel.org
[03:11] <doopsie> i see.. RAWRRRR. it nearly worked!!! it could scan for the networks
[03:11] <ColonelZarkawi> doopsie, is just a suggestion: I haven't read what instructions did you follow, but with linux, rarely reinstallation is a solution for issues
[03:11] <doopsie> but it just couldnt connect
[03:11] <A3n> wtf is wrong with amarok
[03:11] <A3n> it wont play my music

[03:23] <frogzoo> skyrunner: chown
[03:23] <Clavi> frogzoo, qsynaptics, it tells me to set SHMConfig to True in xorg.conf. Did that (in right section), saved it, restarted X, and still comes with thesame line... that I should set  SHMConfig to true in xorg.conf. Going mad here...
[03:23] <jrib> jengc0il: anyway, try 'sudo apt-get install build-essential && sudo apt-get build-dep snort'  and then try to compile snort.  I doubt you need to compile libpcap

[03:24] <frogzoo> skyrunner: you can leave it blank if you only want to change user
[03:24] <jrib> jengc0il: the command I gave you will install it.  But if you want to search for the package, it would be 'apt-cache search -n libpcap'
[03:24] <Elendil> can the commands on 6.06 be used on 6.10 for the fix resolution commands?
[03:24] <jrib> ubotu: tell jengc0il about compiling

[03:24] <Clavi> frogzoo, did that. I typed it by hand. It's located in /etc/X11. I don't know what I'm doind wrong.
[03:25] <drach> jengc0il: first do: apt-cache search libpcap

[03:26] <VigoFuse> Greetings
[03:26] <Clavi> frogzoo, ... no. not yet ;) holdon...
[03:26] <nolimitsoya> ollekalle2, you shouldnt need any special drivers
[03:26] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, -R
[03:26] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, case sensitive
[03:27] <frogzoo> I'm running the ati driver atm, if I upgrade to fglrx will things break ?
[03:27] <ollekalle2> nolimitsoya: I have huge problem with my network and it defenately do not work per default :(
[03:27] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, they might. also, they might not...

[03:28] <skyrunner> wohoo im now owner thanks
[03:28] <skyrunner> what does it mean to be recrusive?
[03:28] <ollekalle2> nolimitsoya: I just cant get my eth0 up and running. I have tried for 5h today after reading forums etc
[03:28] <nolimitsoya> rubso, alternative as alternative fileformat, or alternative as in alternative player?
[03:28] <frogzoo> skyrunner: usually it means for this directory & all subdirectories
[03:29] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, _never_ execute commands you dont understand as root. you might have just broke something, real bad
[03:29] <finalbeta> frogzoo, that's recursive
[03:29] <finalbeta> can't find what his word is.
[03:29] <skyrunner> >_<
[03:29] <frogzoo> finalbeta: I'm assuming that was a typo
[03:29] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, it means to apply the command to every file and dir in that dir
[03:29] <skyrunner> well thats what i wanted so im good =)
[03:29] <VigoFuse> doopsie: There are the Forums
[03:29] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: you check /var/log/messages?
[03:29] <ollekalle2> nolimitsoya: dhclient times out "DHCPDISCOVER"... The very same cable works perfect on my other computer.

[03:29] <skyrunner> thanks you guys!
[03:30] <jengc0il> jrib: ok it clear now
[03:30] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: try mii-tool, use -F to disable autoneg & set speed/duplex manually
[03:30] <jengc0il> jrib: :-P
[03:30] <nolimitsoya> ollekalle2, then the card might be bust, the configurations backwards or any number of things. the fact that its recogniced as eth0 should mean drivers arent a problem

[03:31] <slinky_> thank you folks, have a nice day
[03:32] <ValMarko> I'm ignorant concerning to ubuntu but the first suggestion i would give to anyone: On doubt, ask, ask and ask until you're sure enough you can go forward. I can tell you for sure, when things start working 100%, ubuntu is much better then Windows

[03:33] <neildarlow> i would like to use the vlc mozilla-plugin instead of the totem one. if i attempt to remove the totem mozilla-plugin, it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop. how do i avoid this?
[03:33] <nolimitsoya> neildarlow, you dont.
[03:33] <skyrunner> sudo: must be setuid root
[03:33] <jrib> !ubuntu-desktop | neildarlow
[03:33] <ubotu> neildarlow: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[03:34] <neildarlow> jrib: thanks, i understand that. i just want firefox to not use the totem plugin and use the vlc one instead
[03:34] <ollekalle2> nolimitsoya: Ok, any suggestions on how I can proceed with this issue?
[03:34] <nolimitsoya> neildarlow, then uninstall the totem and install vlc
[03:34] <skyrunner> sudo: must be setuid root <--- thats bad, right?
[03:34] <beca> is there any issues with security.ubuntu.com ? im trying to update my apt lists and im getting no route to host
[03:34] <nolimitsoya> ollekalle2, the one you got didnt return anything?
[03:35] <jrib> neildarlow: you can "touch" the .so files for the plugin and firefox will prefer those
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, it means your user isnt in the sudoers list
[03:35] <ollekalle2> nolimitsoya: ?
[03:35] <neildarlow> nolimitsoya: and uninstalling the totem one wants to remove ubuntu-desktop. hence my question
[03:35] <Clavi> frogzoo, At the end of Xorg.0.log it says, Synaptics touchpad no synaptics touchpad deteted and no repeater device (EE), unable to query device, failed preInit, and then unloads the module. But the touchpad is working (!), but just configured incorrect. This is way over my head. I can edit a couple of conf-files but I don't know which or how.
[03:35] <skyrunner> so how do i sudo list it?
[03:35] <LjL> skyrunner: type "groups", does it list "admin"?
[03:35] <rsteele> ok
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> 15:30:34 <frogzoo> ollekalle2: try mii-tool, use -F to disable autoneg & set speed/duplex manually
[03:35] <jrib> skyrunner: have you been messing with permissions recursively?
[03:35] <cornelius> hi
[03:35] <skyrunner> yes and yes
[03:35] <Answer> Clavi: if it works why mess with it
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> neildarlow, well, as already stated, ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage and can be safely removed
[03:36] <jrib> skyrunner: what command did you do exactly?
[03:36] <VigoFuse_> beca: I have been getting that for 5 days now, no idea the error is,,yet
[03:36] <LjL> skyrunner: define "mess"
[03:36] <nn> how do i extract the contents of a deb without installing it?
[03:36] <neildarlow> jrib: thanks again. seems a bit hackish. i would have hoped alternatives could handle this situation
[03:36] <skyrunner> mess as own /usr
[03:36] <LjL> nn: ar filename.deb
[03:36] <LjL> nn: ar x filename.deb <- correction
[03:36] <cornelius> simple question but i did not find the answer: what is the show desktop keyboard shortcut? Or how can i define it?
[03:36] <jrib> neildarlow: yeah, you could set that up

[03:36] <frogzoo> Clavi: type the error into google & see what comes up
[03:37] <skyrunner> sudo chown <myid> /usr -R

[03:37] <snarf> Does Sun's JDK work well with 64 bit ubuntu?
[03:37] <LjL> skyrunner: i suggest a reinstall, and i suggest not even thinking about doing that again ;)
[03:37] <belfegorash> can i write ubuntu on a cdrw and then to install?

[03:37] <skyrunner> no way to unown?

[03:37] <belfegorash> thank you
[03:37] <nn> LjL: kickass and what i want is in data.tar.gz, i see the format has changed a bit in the last few years ;)
[03:38] <LjL> skyrunner: yeah, you could do chown root /usr -R  --  but then who says everthing there is owned by root?
[03:38] <ihavenoname>  hghg
[03:38] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, as i said, _never_ _ever_ under _any_ circumstances execute anything as root without knowing what you are doing
[03:38] <Answer> Clavi: so it is responsive just not the right resolution?
[03:38] <skyrunner> oh
[03:38] <LjL> skyrunner: i mean, *was* and *is supposed* to be owned by root...
[03:38] <VigoFuse_> Ljl: On a re-install, please explain the process? Is it --purge all ubuntu? or reformat? or just overlay?
[03:38] <LjL> skyrunner: did you use chmod recursively as well?

[03:38] <nolimitsoya> LjL, yes he did
[03:38] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, yes, you did
[03:38] <wceoscar> how can  install beryl by the synaptic??
[03:39] <LjL> VigoFuse_: it's insert the Ubuntu CD and reinstall after backing up your stuff
[03:39] <skyrunner> no i didnt change the permisions, i changed the permision rights
[03:39] <VigoFuse_> Ljl: Thank you
[03:39] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, no, you changed ownership
[03:39] <LjL> skyrunner: in other words you only changed the owner
[03:39] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, thats diffrent
[03:39] <skyrunner> sorry, i changed the ownership
[03:39] <Clavi> Answer, right! not the right resolution, and working absolute (like touchscreen), instead of more like a mouse (touchpad).
[03:39] <Zober> could someone help me with compiling the kernel?  I am trying to upgrade from 2.6.17 to 2.6.19, but I cant seem to figure out how to make the initrd.img file
[03:39] <Answer> Clavi: ok that is not as serious, you can probably just edit xorg.conf
[03:40] <Zober> im running edgy 6.10
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> Zober, what are your reasons for doing so?
[03:40] <skyrunner> so LjL if i change ownership to root will that affect any ways?
[03:40] <LjL> skyrunner: look, i'll check what's owned by whom in my own /usr. hold on. but even if i have everything owned by root, it doesn't mean that on your system it has to be that way, so in principle i still recommend a reinstall
[03:40] <Zober> I read some forums that said the new revision has better support for my mobo

[03:41] <nolimitsoya> *y
[03:41] <LjL> skyrunner: i'm interested in the rationale behind using that chown command anyway. why did you do that? whatever it was that you wanted to achieve, it can be done through other means

[03:42] <nolimitsoya> cornelius, then i have no clue :)

[03:46] <m0biu5> Answer, its something about card consuming too much power
[03:46] <LjL> skyrunner: you could chown everything to root, and then set these three as above... or you could reinstall. doing the former doesn't guarantee anything (specifically, i'm using Kubuntu, and i might have many different packages installed than the ones you have, so my permissions in theory don't mean a thing)

[03:46] <VigoFuse_> cornelius: In Gnome there is a Keyboard Dsiplay that you can make any Hotkey you want, Preferances
[03:46] <LjL> skyrunner: if you want to be safe, reinstall.
[03:46] <Answer> skyrunner: it sounds like you've hosed your permissions just reinstall
[03:46] <A3n> nolimitsoya: that conforts me lol
[03:46] <VigoFuse_> *display
[03:46] <skyrunner> ok ill reinstall, again, haha
[03:46] <theplatypus> If I add a usb 2.0 pci card to an existing installation will it be autodetected at boot?
[03:46] <ollekalle2> nolimitsoya/frogzoo: I cannot really follow here. I did some happy testing with that mii-tool but without succuess. I would appreciate any eth0-for-dummies guidance for my problem (if you have the time)
[03:47] <doopsie> so, can anyone guide me along?
[03:47] <skyrunner> its fun to mess with linux till you need to reinstall and waste another hour or two of your life
[03:47] <doopsie> im at 75 percent of my reinstall now LOL
[03:47] <skyrunner> doing backups now...
[03:47] <Answer> skyrunner: learn more about chown and chmod before you hose your system and blame it on linux...
[03:47] <nolimitsoya> !ask | doopsie
[03:47] <ubotu> doopsie: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:47] <P2500> ... Always make copies of your config files.
[03:47] <LjL> nn: apt-cache --recurse depends ubuntu-minimal
[03:47] <skyrunner> im not blaming it on linux
[03:47] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: is this 10 or 100bps & is it full duplex into a switch, or half duplex into a hub?
[03:48] <skyrunner> its all my fault, linux is very good, i just need to learn it right
[03:48] <Answer> lol
[03:48] <skyrunner> dont read between lines because i dont write in there
[03:48] <doopsie> right. umm, so.. umm... what do i ask?
[03:48] <Answer> skyrunner: in general you shouldn't need to chown or chmod things
[03:48] <nn> LjL: that's showing everything i have installed..
[03:48] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: I have a d-link router 624+ and it wired connection. Does this answer you question? :/
[03:48] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, the biggest lesson here is never do anything unless you are sure you should - always ask first, ask the whole question and dont guess half of it - _never_ use sudo unless you know exactly what you are doing. happy hacking :)
[03:48] <theplatypus> skyrunner: you should have tried linux 8-9 years ago
[03:48] <LjL> skyrunner: well, the first thing to learn is, don't do things as root unless you know exactly what you're doing. ask here first, at the very least
=== VigoFuse__ is now known as VigoFuse
[03:48] <nn> LjL: maybe just skipping recurse will be ok..
[03:48] <Clavi> Answer, My xorg.conf didn't came with touchscreen section. Can I just add it without any problems?
[03:48] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: is it 10Mbps of 100Mbps ?
[03:49] <LjL> nn: ?  what do you have installed?
[03:49] <theplatypus> If I add a usb 2.0 pci card to an existing installation will it be autodetected at boot?
[03:49] <LjL> nn: it definitely shouldn't show everything you have, if you've got a standard ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop system
[03:49] <Answer> Clavi: there should be a section for your device
[03:49] <skyrunner> theplatypus, i dont think i'd enjoyed linux as much when i was 8
[03:49] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: I have 100Mbit.
[03:49] <Haitao> don't we all learn by making mistakes?
[03:49] <skyrunner> oh dont worry guys lesson learned
[03:50] <masse|deferred> will i need xubuntu for a PIII 650mhz with 512mb of ram?
[03:50] <k31th> afternoon
[03:50] <Haitao> ;-)
[03:50] <Answer> masse|deferred: no but it will help
[03:50] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, i would :) its so much less hassle than windows... i hated having to reformat every other month after major win3/95 breakage when i was 8-12...
[03:50] <xx55445xx> I have a WinXP partition that takes up 75 of the 78 GB hard drive, is it possible to resize the partitions (to make enough room for ubuntu) without losing data?
[03:50] <LjL> nn: but you're right, it definitely errs on the huge side... it probably lists every possible alternative, including dependencies of packages listed as Conflicts and the like
[03:50] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: try 'sudo  mii-tool eth0 -F 100baseTx-FD'  & then try dhcpclient again
[03:50] <skyrunner> hahaha
[03:50] <cornelius> VigoFuse_: did not find the hotkey setup. but i found the default shortcut. its ctrl-alt-D. Thanx
[03:50] <LjL> nn: but without --recurse i think it'll just list the plain dependencies of ubuntu-minimal, which are far from what you need
[03:50] <nolimitsoya> xx55445xx, yes, but its dangerous. have a backup
[03:50] <Answer> xx55445xx: while technically 3GB is enough, you probably don't have 3GB in contiguous freespace
[03:51] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: you may also need to check the same settings on the router
[03:51] <Haitao> xx55445xx: Sure
[03:51] <Clavi> Answer, Yes I found it qsynaptics, but adding the line there (SHMConfig to true) doesn't seem to work. The module gets unloaded (xorg.0.log).
[03:51] <nn> LjL: yea.. hrmm.. if i weren't using ubuntu pkg's i'd be ok here, but i'm kinda hoping to create just a very little ubuntu for this 512mb thumbdrive
[03:51] <doopsie> okay.. let me try asking the question again. How do i get intel PRO/wireless 3954 chipset to work?
[03:51] <skyrunner> so
[03:51] <nn> LjL: i need something i can boot off, with an X server, SSH, my coolkey packages, and a few other things, such that i can access my ubuntu server from other places
[03:52] <doopsie> i've tried the forum helps.
[03:52] <Answer> Clavi: I dunno then.. I just had to change the Max and Min XY values to get my touchscreen to work
[03:52] <skyrunner> after I reinstall there's another issue
[03:52] <Haitao> xx55445xx: installation takes care of this automatically
[03:52] <skyrunner> how do I put extra skins to amsn?
[03:52] <skyrunner> D :
[03:52] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: looks much better now! How do I assure that setting is static?
[03:52] <Clavi> Answer, ok, thanx anyway
[03:52] <skyrunner> couldn't work that out either
[03:53] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, amsn is trouble. i suggest using gaim instead.
[03:54] <ubuntu415> Hey its the xx34234xx guy again
[03:54] <noelferreira> any help with rt61 wireless driver in edy amd64? I can't get ip from router.
[03:54] <ubuntu415> how risky would it be to do the resize?
[03:54] <LjL> nn: look, can't guarantee this works correctly (i.e. it may not really list all needed packages), but i've been making this thing yesterday:
[03:54] <LjL> !offline | nn
[03:54] <ubotu> nn: If you need to download Ubuntu packages using another machine or OS, http://ljl.byethost14.com/apt.php may help you with determining which dependencies to fetch
[03:54] <ubuntu415> Im only using 18 GB of the HD anyways
[03:54] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu415, very. have a backup, allways
[03:54] <nolimitsoya> *-l
[03:54] <Haitao> skyrunner: mercury also not bad and supports webcam
[03:55] <skyrunner> ill try mercury D :
[03:55] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu415, and remember to _always_ pack data as hard as possible on the partition you want to resize. use dirms
[03:55] <skyrunner> im on gaim atm
[03:55] <skyrunner> not bad
[03:55] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: at the bottom of the eth0 section in /etc/network/interfaces, add a line 'pre-up mii-tool eth0 -F 100baseTx-FD'
[03:55] <LjL> nn: put "ubuntu-minimal" in as a package, and leave the metapackage box empty. note that, for starters, it will *not* list 1) the linux kernel 2) binutils 3) probably other stuff, simply because those are *not* listed in ubuntu-minimal (or ubuntu-desktop for that matter)
[03:55] <nn> LjL: thanks, it'll at very least get me in the right direction
[03:55] <fieberp> I'm trying to get php to run iptables commands by shell_exec, but I am having trouble configuring Ubuntu to allow this to happen.  I have added 'daemon' to the sudoers file (using visudo) and set it to run iptables with NOPASSWD, but it still won't execute. Any ideas?
[03:56] <Answer> fieberp: what is the shell_exec line you are trying to execute in php
[03:56] <theplatypus> If I add a usb 2.0 pci card to an existing installation will it be autodetected at boot?
[03:56] <nn> LjL: i know generally what needs to be in the system (anything not 2.6 or ubuntu specific) so it should get me in the right direction, at least
[03:56] <frogzoo> how to get edgy to pick up a compact flash card plugged in via pcmcia ?
[03:56] <fieberp> shell_exec( "sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 -d 10.0.2.100 -j ACCEPT" )
[03:56] <Haitao> noelferreira: have you tried with a fixed IP to test your connection?
[03:56] <nn> LjL: been a few years since i've had to embed linux onto something semi-small (512mb is pretty huge really)
[03:56] <nn> LjL: but i'm shooting for sub-128mb
[03:56] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, should automount...
[03:56] <frogzoo> nvm, I'm a moron - thx nolimitsoya
[03:57] <LjL> nn: doesn't the Alternate CD also give you some "minimal" installation options?
[03:57] <nn> stuff it into the DiskOnModule on a thin client i have
[03:57] <air0day> How do I mount a share using NFS?
[03:57] <LjL> nn: and see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD as well
[03:57] <wrathchild9> hi
[03:57] <nn> LjL: i cant install from a CD :P

[03:57] <wrathchild9> where I can download x-shockwave-flash plugin for firefox?
[03:57] <Answer> wrathchild9: from mozilla firefox .com
[03:57] <noelferreira> my system crashed if i changed /etc/network/interface file Haitao
[03:57] <frogzoo> !flash | wrathchild9
[03:57] <nothlit> nn, pxebooting
[03:57] <ubotu> wrathchild9: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[03:58] <LjL> nn: you could always use a virtual machine to install from the "CD" (while keeping it as an ISO image and without really burning a CD)
[03:58] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: more than thanks!
[03:58] <Haitao> noelferreira: crash like in hang or restart or...?
[03:58] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: yw, enjoy
[03:58] <air0day> is there a tutorial somewhere for mounting a share using nfs?
[03:58] <dirle> how can I change the font size?
[03:58] <noelferreira> restart Haitao mouse and sound don't work
[03:58] <LjL> Ubotu, tell air0day about nfs | air0day, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:59] <nolimitsoya> !nfs | air0day
[03:59] <ubotu> air0day: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[03:59] <frogzoo> air0day: try tldp.org
[03:59] <noelferreira> but know i blacklisted rt61pci and remove module and it work Haitao
[03:59] <kriel> -crossposted to xubuntu- I can't get mount to work from CLI interface. mke2fs seemed to work, but when I mount it, it whines about being invalid.   my commands: # mke2fs /dev/hdc   # mkdir stuff   # mount -t ext2 /dev/hdc /stuff
[03:59] <LjL> nn: i guess you might find this howto useful as well: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[04:00] <nn> LjL: yea i could probably do some chroot and loopback trickery
[04:00] <air0day> ljl, I'm doing something similar to that already, but i keep being told "Permission Denied"?
[04:00] <fieberp> command works fine from command line as root,but will not run via php shell_exec. Just get no response.
[04:00] <noelferreira> Haitao: and now i got ip from router and i ping it but i can't get nothing with firefox
[04:00] <skyrunner> ok reinstalling, bye guys thanks again
[04:00] <nolimitsoya> kriel, you dont mkfs a drive. you mkfs a partition
[04:00] <Answer> kriel: what is the exact error message please
[04:01] <nothlit> you can give a whole drive a filesystem
[04:01] <kriel> nolimitsoya: ... crap. ehheh.
[04:01] <cygnus_> hwo come ubuntu is free

[04:01] <rhodri> hi, is there a difference in the version of alsa that ships with the edgy releases of ubuntu and kubuntu?
[04:01] <theplatypus> If I add a usb 2.0 pci card to an existing installation will it be autodetected at boot?
[04:02] <kriel> Answer: can't find an ext2 drive on dev... wrong fs, bad partition, bad type...
[04:02] <nothlit> canonical sponsors ubuntu but volunteers contribute to its development
[04:02] <nolimitsoya> theplatypus, yes
[04:02] <dirle> can any1 tell me what are the default settings for the fonts?
[04:02] <air0day> what should I do to resolve a "Permission denied" error?
[04:02] <theplatypus> nolimitsoya: thanks
[04:02] <QwertyM> beryl's burning my desktop :D
[04:02] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: sorry for additional bothering. It seems like my fooling around today made the eth0 not to enable at boot time. Do you know how to make it auto-enable?
[04:03] <Haitao> noelferreira: did you try to google it? i found quite a lot of results
[04:03] <nothlit> theplatypus, there shouldn't be, it would probably be gnome/kde's sound server
[04:03] <Rontana> Ive set up Apt-Cacher on one of my ubuntu machines, and set one of the other ones to use it as an apt source. however i keep getting errors about no route to host for archive.ubuntu.com:80 occationaly when it tries to grab a package. this seems to happen at random thou, and if i go back to a sources.list that doesnt use the apt-cacher everything seems to work fine. any ideas why it occationaly cant find the server?
[04:03] <noelferreira> lol Haitao
[04:03] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: in /etc/network/interfaces, you need a line 'auto eth0'
[04:03] <Clavi> Anybody know where I can see currently used inbound xserver devices? Like mouse?
[04:03] <air0day> its a Western Digital Netcenter drive. does anyone have any experience with that?
[04:03] <theplatypus> nothlit: ? I'm not sure what the sound server has to do with usb 2.0 pci card
[04:04] <Haitao> noelferreira: I don t have specific knowledge about this driver :(
[04:04] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: I have already... :/ any perticular order?
[04:04] <frogzoo> Rontana: does it have the archive.ubuntu.com mentioned in /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[04:04] <nothlit> theplatypus, you asked about sound differences in kubuntu/ubuntu, i would assume you have a problem with sound in one and not the other?
[04:04] <Haitao> noelferreira: sorry :S
[04:04] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: it will only come up automatically at boot
[04:05] <A3n> ok i changed my mind, i want an MSN messenger equivalent that is fast in file transfer and beautifull
[04:05] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: my interfaces says: iface eth0 inet dhcp;auto eth0;pre-up mii-tool eth0 -F 100baseTx-FD
[04:05] <A3n> cause aMSN is really really ugly
[04:05] <nuked_omen> what is a good file manager for linux
[04:05] <Pelo> gaim
[04:05] <A3n> and i couldnt transfer a file
[04:05] <nuked_omen> cuz i didn't like nautilus or konqueror
[04:05] <theplatypus> nothlit: thanks, but you have me confused with someone else
[04:05] <frogzoo> ollekalle2: the auto eth0 should come first
[04:05] <nothlit> gnome-commander, pcmanfm
[04:05] <Condorcet> kopete, A3n
[04:05] <A3n> yea, maybe i'd go get gaim
[04:05] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: I just restarted my computer (shutdown -r now)
[04:05] <Pelo> nuked_omen,  try thunar
[04:05] <nuked_omen> amsn is cool
[04:05] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: I will try witg that one first
[04:05] <nothlit> theplatypus, oops sorry
[04:06] <Clavi> Anybody know where I can see currently used inbound xserver devices? Like mouse?
[04:06] <Condorcet> kopete is rich in functions
[04:06] <nuked_omen> Pelo, thunar is that stupid manger for xfce, right?
[04:06] <Rontana> frogzoo: ive got apt-cacher set to use archive.ubuntu.com, ive also tried gb.archive.ubuntu.com but get the same issues
[04:06] <Pelo> nuked_omen,  not sure,
[04:06] <romannk> :)
[04:06] <theplatypus> nothlit: not a problem. I hope whomever it was directed to noticed
[04:06] <chichilla> 
[04:06] <Rontana> if i directy put archive.ubuntu.com in the sources.list it works, but that defeats the poing of using apt-cacher
[04:07] <Rontana> point even
[04:07] <Pelo> nuked_omen,  just search synaptic for file managers  and try them all
=== romannk is now known as kicked
[04:07] <nuked_omen> Pelo, good idea
[04:07] <noelferreira> thanks anyway Haitao
[04:07] <Pelo> nuked_omen,  that doesn'T realy count as an idea
[04:07] <nuked_omen> Pelo, thanks for the reminder
[04:07] <Pelo> better
[04:08] <ollekalle2> frogzoo: even eith "auto eth0" at top I need to run dhclient manually to get a IP.

[04:14] <Pelo> kingace,  the nice ppl at  #xgl might be better sutited to help you
[04:14] <ColonelZarkawi> jamesbrose, google says: "webmin is an embarassing piece of crap". Why do you insist using that "tool"?
[04:14] <theplatypus> does beryl have any practical application or is it basicaly just eyecandy?
[04:14] <jamesbrose> lolll
[04:14] <ColonelZarkawi> I know it's not my call, you are free to use the tools that you want

[04:15] <Everflex> I have a problem with "su". When i type "su" and enter my password, then it outputs "Authentication failure". What's wrong?
[04:15] <gephalt> the man bash is just too bulky to get my head round it
[04:15] <jamesbrose> erm it wants to install some packages
[04:15] <nolimitsoya> theplatypus, that is, its just eyecandy. nothing practical
[04:15] <jamesbrose> that aint there :P
[04:15] <theplatypus> nolimitsoya: cool thanks
[04:15] <fresco> could anyone paste the default /etc/hosts file somewhere? i've managed to delete mine by accident

[04:20] <dirle> got used with some things with linux.. but  need help with installing the unified driver for my scx4100 printer
[04:21] <Everflex> boink: sudo su, what does that do?
[04:21] <boink> dirle: been to www.linuxprinting.org ?
[04:21] <dirle> I found nothing under the synaptic
[04:21] <boink> sudo su gives you a root shell
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> Everflex, it logs you in as root
[04:21] <dirle> ye boink
[04:21] <dirle> *yes
[04:21] <boink> and is your printer there? does it have linux drivers?
[04:21] <Haitao> Everflex: but then again, it'll give you another opportunity to come here and ask questions ;-)
[04:21] <Everflex> boink: but does it do it differently than just "su"?
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> Everflex, no
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> Everflex, just easier
[04:22] <jengc0il> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36258/
[04:22] <Everflex> ok.. thanks :D
[04:22] <boink> sometimes I get annoyed with having to type in sudo all the time
[04:22] <dirle> yes .. downloaded them and when I try to install it says the hardware undefinied
[04:22] <boink> old unix habit, you see
[04:22] <imperfect-> Everflex : sudo is a wrapper for su. more fine grained control than su. ;)
[04:22] <boink> when I'm doing some work, I just sudo su
[04:22] <l3on_> a dock for gnome?
[04:22] <boink> I'm getting used slowly to "sudo" :)
[04:22] <dirle> no problems here using sudo.. hehe
[04:22] <imperfect-> Well, it's really intended to give people limited access
[04:23] <jengc0il> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36258/
[04:23] <imperfect-> For your front line admins for instance.
[04:23] <jengc0il> ?
[04:23] <dirle> this is my first day in linux
[04:23] <imperfect-> So you don't have to give out the su password to everyone
[04:23] <l3on_> do you know a dock for gnome?
[04:23] <livingtarget> is there an easy way to throttle my cpu up or disable cpu throttling?
[04:23] <imperfect-> You might want them to be able to reset user passwords
[04:23] <imperfect-> but you dont want them to fsck with your arrays
[04:23] <dirle> got here cause wanted a dual boot with my vista.. and I messed up the mbr..
[04:23] <imperfect-> For isntance.
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> livingtarget, should be able to disable throttling in bios
[04:24] <dirle> so far I like ubuntu.. but boy is different from windows.. lol
[04:24] <jengc0il> need help
[04:24] <jengc0il> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36258/
[04:24] <jengc0il> =-O
[04:25] <nolimitsoya> dirle, http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm ;)
[04:25] <livingtarget> nolimitsoya: okay, will try that then
[04:25] <Pelo> jengc0il,  so install flex and uninstall lex , what's the problem ?
[04:25] <nolimitsoya> livingtarget, there is a gnome plugin that lets you monitor/manage throttling as well
[04:26] <livingtarget> monitors alright
[04:26] <nolimitsoya> livingtarget, what problem are you having?
[04:26] <dirle> ty nolimit.. I do like the ideea of the opensource.. hack.. the new OS from Microsoft cost a bit too much ;)
[04:27] <nolimitsoya> dirle, not to forget the palladuim threat...
[04:27] <rhodri> hi, i'm following a tutorial that assumes i have libasound version 1.0.12 for edgy, but my edgy only has version 1.0.11, and i checked the ubuntu packages search and that says edgy has 1.0.12 aswell... and fiesty has version 1.0.13... so where does 1.0.12 fit into this, can anyone help?!!?!?!  thanks.
[04:27] <nolimitsoya> *palladium
[04:27] <dirle> ?
[04:27] <rhodri> sorry, i meant ubuntu package search says libasound 1.0.11 in edgy.  thanks.

[04:29] <jengc0il> Pelo: wht do u mean by flex?
[04:29] <dirle> back to my problem.. how can I force a driver installation?
[04:29] <nolimitsoya> dirle, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-Generation_Secure_Computing_Base
[04:29] <dirle> what I've downloaded from Samsung for my SCX4100 dowsn't want to install by itself
[04:29] <nolimitsoya> dirle, force?
[04:29] <Pelo> jengc0il,  read your own pastebin,   it says lex isn'T enough and to try flex , so look for those in synaptic and see if you can make the switch
[04:30] <jengc0il> Pelo: switch by wht?
[04:30] <dirle> I tried the synaptic.. and don't find the driver there..
[04:31] <Pelo> jengc0il,   open synaptic ( system > admin > synaptic ) do a search for "flex"  install,   then try instaling your other thing again
[04:31] <dirle> well nolimit.. am not that mean.. but how I can install it?.. baby steps are welcomed as well ..
[04:32] <nom2> salut
[04:32] <aventis_khan> hello
[04:32] <dirle> roman?
[04:32] <aventis_khan> i need help wid ubuntu 6.10
[04:33] <Pelo> aventis_khan,  you need to be a little more specific
[04:33] <nolimitsoya> dirle, i dont know what you are trying to do, or what you have downloaded
=== abimanyu is now known as poiuy
[04:33] <dirle> have downloaded the unified driver for linux from samsung
[04:34] <nolimitsoya> dirle, usualy driver installations means modprobing the driver, or recompiling the kernel
[04:34] <poiuy> hey..i need to run vcd .dat files on ubuntu
[04:34] <dirle> for my SCX4100 MFP printer
[04:34] <boink> ok, what does the documentation say about it?
[04:34] <poiuy> how to do run .dat files?
[04:34] <nolimitsoya> dirle, are you sure there is nodriver in the cups system?
[04:34] <Pelo> dirle, doesn'T CUPS run your printer ?
[04:34] <aventis_khan> in stalled it, trying to set up my dial up modem, configured modem from networking tools ,added it to panel , set it as enabled, but it wont get activated and i cant connect to net
[04:34] <dirle> translate pls :)
[04:34] <boink> of course, CUPS runs printers on ubuntu
[04:34] <boink> !cups
[04:34] <ubotu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[04:34] <Pelo> poiuy,  open it in gedit
[04:34] <poiuy> then?
[04:34] <nolimitsoya> dirle, just open the gnome-cups-manager and click add printer
[04:35] <dirle> tried that. .and the driver listed there does not work
[04:35] <Pelo> poiuy, you mean run as in an exectutable ?
[04:35] <rsteele> hi
[04:35] <aventis_khan> how do i set my modem?
[04:35] <Pelo> poiuy,  just launch it from the terminal
[04:35] <rsteele> confidential
[04:35] <boink> dirle: sounds like you'll have to read on it much more
[04:35] <boink> you've done a google search as well?
[04:35] <trilly> hey guys
[04:35] <poiuy> as a movie...
[04:35] <poiuy> .dat is the format of my vcd
[04:35] <dirle> yes I did.. but I'll get back on it.. and use the links above
[04:36] <Pelo> aventis_khan,  search for your modem make and model  in the forum
[04:36] <boink> !tell dirle about cups
[04:36] <boink> welcome to linux .. and welcome to google
[04:36] <aventis_khan> i got USR 56K external serial modem
[04:36] <Pelo> poiuy,  launch totem and open the file from tehre
[04:36] <dirle> :).. ty all
[04:36] <dirle> this is fun
[04:36] <boink> it's linux
[04:36] <boink> and you have a tough one there
[04:36] <dirle> hehe.. remember that ?I'm gonan have a dual boot ;)
[04:37] <trilly> it seems like im having a problem with udev- everything worked fine but now i switched the kernel to an older (debian) version and devices dont seem to appear normally anymore (no /dev/input/event* i.e.)
[04:37] <Pelo> aventis_khan,  go to the forum and search for the model
[04:37] <poiuy> how to change setup options in xine?
[04:37] <trilly> how do i get udev out of my system?
[04:37] <boink> why are you using an older kernel?
[04:37] <boink> there really is no need to change the ubuntu kernel
[04:37] <trilly> boink: because pcmcia doesnt work with the edgy 2.6.17 kernel with my legacy laptop
[04:37] <boink> pcmcia .. wireless network card?
[04:37] <aventis_khan> Pelo: so it is my modem issue?
[04:38] <poiuy> how to change setup options in xine?
[04:38] <trilly> boink: and it finally works with versions under 2.6.12 (because its pcmcia-cs) - yes, WLAN (its the laptop plugin-cards)
[04:38] <boink> I had the same problem with edgy too, using xubuntu
[04:38] <Jboy144> Um, if someone isn't to busy I also have a quick question about 6.10 installation.
[04:38] <poiuy> how to change setup options in xine?
[04:38] <nn> .part
[04:38] <boink> it's a bug, you need to install some more modules
[04:38] <jokoon> I'm looking for the quake 3 1.32c point release for linux
=== mcmahonm is now known as mcmahonm[A] 
[04:39] <boink> I have a NetGear WG511T which now works just lovely, but it was a hassle to get the right modules
[04:39] <boink> silly bug on edgy :/
[04:39] <trilly> boink: pcmcia issue or sound? because i dont think you have a legacy powerbook g3 wallstreet which JUST works with pcmcia-cs but not with udev
[04:39] <Pelo> aventis_khan, I don'T know how to help you with your modem, which is why I am suggesting you search for your model in the forum http://www.ubuntuforums.org/, there is a good chance you'll find instructions there
[04:40] <boink> I'm saying there's a problem with pcmcia wireless cards on edgy
[04:40] <boink> and you need to install some modules
[04:40] <amorphous_> hey y'all ;)
[04:40] <trilly> boink: yeah, but no pcmcia card works, for example not even a usb adapter
[04:41] <boink> how often do I have to repeat myself here?
[04:41] <aventis_khan> Pelo:thanks, im on forum now
[04:41] <Pelo> boink,  42
[04:41] <boink> no thanks.
[04:41] <boink> I've made my point already
[04:42] <Elendil> Hello, when i boot up ubuntu to the installation disk, and i get to the desktop where i press isntall, i cant press anything and the display shows it all like the lines of color are all displaced and its weird looking
[04:42] <amorphous_> Q: does anyone know how to customise an installation? would I have to do it from server install & apt-get X if i only want certain packages (ie dont want abiword, pcmcia, and lots of other stuff)
[04:42] <Rontana> just outa interest what would happen if i ran the command 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop' would i still have a working system at the end of it? (its currenty just a command line only install)
[04:42] <boink> Elendil: use the alternate CD to install
[04:42] <elfreakz> i need java for my firefox... how to get it?
[04:42] <trilly> boink: dont be so rude- all im saying is IT DOES NOT WORK with the newer kernel. period. now i have a fine old kernel and i need to disable udev and activate devfs or something. how do i do that?
[04:42] <Pelo> Elendil,  try with the alternate install cd it installins in cli
[04:43] <boink> you're rude by not listening.
[04:43] <Erudition> hello
[04:43] <amorphous_> Rontana, sounds like you and i are in similar situation
[04:43] <A3n> amorphous: just blacklist or delete the modules
[04:43] <amorphous_> Rontana, only different
[04:43] <mtyhome> hi
[04:43] <Elendil> alternate, what type of installation? the oem or text?
[04:43] <mtyhome> do you know a good samba backup script?
[04:43] <boink> there's an alternate CD. use that instead of the live CD
[04:43] <Elendil> kk
[04:44] <michaelwilson> whenever i play games my screen fades to really dark black then snaps back after a while to the original color.
[04:44] <amorphous_> I remember fedora/redhat having a sort of "package selector" on setup... any chance that it's possible to do this with ubuntu?
[04:44] <trilly> boink: youre just saying "load some modules, load some modules" - i can load some modules, i can load all the modules i want and it doesnt work, cant you just accept that fact? ive worked on that problem for weeks, trying to find a kernel with which it does work...  (or can you at least tell me which magical module to load? because ive searched the internet _thouroughly_
[04:45] <Ji2> Hello
[04:45] <nolimitsoya> amorphous_, the apt system pretty much makes such a feature redundant
[04:45] <elfreakz> i need java for my firefox... how to get it?
[04:45] <amorphous_> nolimitsoya, and will it workproperly if i start with a bare minimal text install?
[04:46] <Elendil> for the alternate cd, do i install text mode or OEM mode
[04:46] <mtyhome> so?
[04:46] <Elendil> ?
[04:46] <Ji2> I am trying to run a game that needs libcurl.so.2 I tried to get it with the package manager but it gave me libcurl.so.3. Is there somewhere I can get libcurl.so.2?
[04:46] <boink> Elendil: it's just an install Cd.
[04:46] <Elendil> i know
[04:46] <boink> works quite well, no liveCD stuff
[04:46] <Elendil> but i gives me options
[04:46] <Elendil> boink-
[04:46] <boink> the install is quite easy, same as with the liveCD
[04:46] <amorphous_> nolimitsoya, i'm just after conformation that it doesn't give glitches if not @ install...
[04:46] <nolimitsoya> amorphous_, what will?
[04:46] <fromvega> I used to use my adsl modem as router, now I'm configuring a machine as the proxy server. So I must change the modem mode to bridge or half-bridge? Could you help-me? What's the difference?
[04:47] <Elendil> Boink - i know but their is different options of installation...
[04:47] <trilly> boink: hello? -- or anyone?
[04:47] <nolimitsoya> amorphous_, im running a "custom" system right now, where i did a cli install and then just apt-got the packages i wanted
[04:47] <boink> fromvega: which type of proxy server?
[04:47] <mtyhome> do you know a good backup script for samba?
[04:47] <amorphous_> installing minimal then apt-ing - or is that how it installs anyways
[04:47] <amorphous_> ?
[04:47] <A3n> ji2:packages.ubuntu.com/
[04:47] <Erudition> I disabled IPv6 because it is not supported by my router and any DNS queries via IPv6 time out. Everything seems to work in most apps, but I have noticed that some programs seem to get 1.0.0.0 when resolving names. For example: XChat (I'm in KSIrc) and GAIM (won't login until I login with Kopete, then logs in with GAIM) and Wget. I can get around this by issuing a ping command to the server, which resolves the IP correctly, and the app then uses
[04:47] <Erudition> the IP stored in cache. But this is tedious and I'm kind of annoyed. When I run "ip a | grep inet6 " nothing appears, which seems to indicate IPv6 has been disabled.. Any Ideas?
[04:47] <amorphous_> noli ^^
[04:47] <amorphous_> nolimitsoya,  ^^
[04:47] <Ji2> A3n: thankyou
=== Zdra is now known as Zdra_
[04:48] <nolimitsoya> amorphous_, whas that what you wanted to hear?
[04:48] <fromvega> boink: hum... I'm using SQUID and I think it's a transparent proxy because I have two network cards, one of them connects to the hub-switch where the other machines are.
=== Zdra_ is now known as Zdra
[04:48] <thething> Hi guys!!!
[04:48] <fromvega> boink: is it right?
[04:48] <boink> squid is just a httpd proxy
[04:48] <thething> I've a problem with a printer, someone can help me?
[04:48] <amorphous_> nolimitsoya, that it would work ok? ---yeah - that would be nice to hear :)
[04:49] <boink> it depends if you want the whole internet to be able to use it or just your internal network
[04:49] <trilly> thething: i can tell you who _cant_ help
[04:49] <amorphous_> nolimitsoya, - is that what you can tell me? (honestly!)
[04:49] <thething> oh!
[04:49] <barosl> hey. i deleted /var/lib/dpkg/status accidentally.
[04:49] <nolimitsoya> amorphous_, i still dont quite understand what you want to do, but with apt, installing software is a piece of cake, and dependecy hell is no real problem
[04:49] <barosl> what should i do?
[04:49] <boink> in reality, squid will work fine .. you need not to do anything to your router.
[04:49] <fromvega> boink: what I want is the following, I want to control the internet access of all machines in my local network!
[04:50] <trilly> thething: no seriously, i dont have a printer system so i cant help you, sorry
[04:50] <thething> Someone had managed to have a parallel printer work in edgy eft?
[04:50] <Alakazamz0r> man, the ubuntu mirrors got fast.
[04:50] <boink> fromvega: ok, you can do that. you'll need to set up a sort double-nat for that
[04:50] <Rontana> amorphous_: it is posible to install just the basic system (no serevers like ssh etc) and build up from there
[04:50] <boink> and to restrict access on the router to only your internal linux router box
[04:50] <boink> and with iptables, force all requested for port 80 to go to squid
[04:50] <trilly_> ah
[04:51] <boink> !squid
[04:51] <we2by> I f*cking hate gedit when working over ftp :(
[04:51] <ubotu> squid: Internet Object Cache (WWW proxy cache). In component main, is optional. Version 2.6.1-3ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 576 kB, installed size 1524 kB

[04:51] <we2by> I just lost a big part of my work :(
[04:51] <amorphous_> nolimitsoya, - when using apt uninstalling doesn't work - well i say that - what i mean is, it only uninstalls the pakage -  not the dependencies that came with it. If i want to remove the dep's, do I have to look them each up & remove them by hand?
[04:51] <boink> adress? with a stamp even? :)
[04:51] <trilly_> trilly: adress? with a stamp even? :)
[04:52] <Allz> LjL are you here?
[04:52] <Allz> LjL are you here?
[04:52] <Allz> LjL are you here?
[04:52] <nolimitsoya> amorphous_, no, if you installa a package that installs dependencies, you can use apt-get autoremove to get rid of those after uninstalling the package that installed them
[04:52] <nolimitsoya> did that make sense?
[04:52] <trilly_> lol
[04:52] <Erudition> boink: the username before the message is the "address" most IRC clients highlight these messages
[04:52] <LookTJ> how do i reconfigure proftpd package?
[04:53] <fromvega> boink: hum... I do not want to configure the IP of the proxy in every machine. How should I procede? I'm using two network cards for that like I said, one connect to the hub and the other connected to the router.
[04:53] <wy> Is there a way to let the window manager remember the window size and positions?
[04:53] <nolimitsoya> amorphous_, 'sudo apt-get autoremove' cleans out unused and unneeded dependencies. was that clearer? :)
[04:53] <elfreakz> i need java plugin for firefox?? anybody?
[04:53] <amorphous_> nolimitsoya, thank you.
[04:53] <amorphous_> < apologises for any unclear/confusingness... :(

[04:54] <elfreakz> how to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 ??
[04:54] <trilly_> what happened to the ubuntu support? it WAS the best, but that was quite some time ago it seems..

[04:57] <Erudition> the IP stored in cache. But this is tedious and I'm kind of annoyed. When I run "ip a | grep inet6 " nothing appears, which seems to indicate IPv6 has been disabled.. Any Ideas?]

[04:58] <drkm> i'm thinking about installing ubuntu.. last time i install linux i had to configure swap.. do you still have to do that with ubuntu during the install process?
[04:58] <LadyNikon> drkm: swap.. boot.. and root.
[04:58] <boink> drkm: I installed swap from apt-get
[04:58] <LadyNikon> drkm: there is a format wizard i believe
[04:58] <boink> though, I find swap pointless.
[04:58] <nunod> drkm, not necessarily..
[04:58] <LadyNikon> yeah some people dont use it

=== Zdra_ is now known as Zdra
[04:59] <drkm> what is the calculation i use to detrimine how big i make my swap compared to how much ram i have?
[04:59] <rever> How come cpu  is used instead of the gpu?
[04:59] <belfegorash> what i do wrong?
[04:59] <dirle> IT WORKSS.. WEEEEEEEE
[04:59] <dirle> ttY guys
[04:59] <tom__> how can i kill X11 from a terminal?
[04:59] <boink> dirle: you lucky ba***** !
[04:59] <dirle> ;)
[04:59] <LjL> drkm: there isn't one. it depends on preferences and religions. but you should make your swap *at least* as big as your RAM, or things like hibernation won't work
[05:00] <rever> drkm, Same as with page file 1.5x your ram
[05:00] <boink> oooops .. swap! heh, I thought swat *duh*
[05:00] <boink> sorry
[05:00] <ReWT_AxS> can someone help me configure my sound? it's not working. I have a presario dx2200. Speakers are built into the tower
[05:00] <drkm> rever: ok thanks
[05:00] <dirle> man.. linux is different but tell you this.. have never used it.. and it's not as hard as many have said.. it is just different
[05:00] <boink> dirle: wait until it really doesn't work
[05:00] <HumanPrototype> drkm, normally swap is twice your ram but thats kinda outta date since ram got so big
[05:00] <dirle> lol
[05:01] <boink> dirle: and "linux" doesn't exist, you're using Ubuntu
[05:01] <rever> dirle, Linux GUI ie Gnome KDE and installing software is easier than M$
[05:01] <Elendil> So, hows everyone doing today?
[05:01] <nunod> my swap is 25% my ram
[05:01] <frogzoo> drkm: if you've a lot of ram use same space for swap, if 512 or less, use 2x
[05:01] <ReWT_AxS> Elendil, I'd be better if I had sound.
[05:01] <ReWT_AxS> -.-
[05:01] <frogzoo> nunod: hibernate will freak out

[05:05] <ReWT_AxS> yea
[05:05] <drkm> when upgrading i am either considering have dual boot with windows xp.. or installing windows xp to vmware.. which do you recommend?
[05:05] <kwood> after attempting to 'startx' i get the following errors.  screens found but none have a usable config and then below that fatal server error: no screens found.. any ideas?
[05:05] <Elendil> so anyone here not from the US?
[05:06] <boink> drmk: depends on what you need to do
[05:06] <qkslvrwolf> is there any way to get a certain usb hard drive to always mount at the same scsi device?
[05:06] <Jboy144> Canada here
[05:06] <qkslvrwolf> mine mounts at sda or sdb
[05:06] <Elendil> cool
[05:06] <qkslvrwolf> even when it is the only drive attached to the computer
[05:06] <drkm> boink: what are the limitations with vmware?
[05:06] <qkslvrwolf> and it jacks up my fstab
[05:06] <rever> ReWT_AxS, ok give me a minute. I need to ssh into my work box to look at the proper module
[05:06] <ReWT_AxS> k ty
[05:06] <boink> well .. vmware works very well, but it isn't the real thing
[05:06] <Yggdrasil> hello, can somone help me with cups. the printer url is hp:/usb/OfficeJet_6100_Series?serial=MY38TH62DR2R and im trying to conect to it from another computer on my network and i dont know what its url is.
[05:06] <drkm> boink: what does that mean
[05:07] <boink> it means .. what do you want to do with windows?
[05:07] <boink> play games? word processing? making viruses?
[05:07] <drkm> boink: run windows applications like photoshop and some poker clients i use
[05:07] <boink> then you would want a real version of windows, dual boot
[05:08] <drkm> boink: what can't it out of that list?
[05:08] <boink> keep in mind, when you make a dual boot. you must install windows first
[05:08] <kwood> after attempting to 'startx' i get the following errors. screens found but none have a usable config and then below that fatal server error: no screens found.. any ideas?... is there some config i need torun?
[05:08] <boink> and photoshop needs a lot of memory
[05:09] <boink> using photoshop with many windows open could be a very painful experience under VMWare
[05:09] <drkm> boink: well if i don't use photoshop.. could it cope with the poker clients?
[05:09] <klees> is there a way to appropriately control the write speed from Nautilus?
[05:09] <klees> burn speed
[05:09] <boink> maybe
[05:10] <klees> it doesn't list all of my drive's write speeds
[05:10] <drkm> boink: well if it can't even cope with poker clients.. what is vmware designed to cope with?
[05:10] <boink> since I don't know your poker clients at all, it's hard for me to say.
[05:10] <qkslvrwolf> Is there any way to mandate what scsi drive number a certain usb disk gets when I mount it?  Because it mounting at sda or sdb randomly, and it makes it hard to get my fstab right...
[05:10] <drkm> boink: can u give me some examples of things it can cope with so i can compare it with what i know
[05:11] <elfreakz> i try to install .bin file but ubuntu say Could not open the file /home/el/Desktop/jre-1_5_0_09-linux-i586-rpm.bin. ..... gedit has not been able to detect the character coding.
[05:11] <elfreakz> Please check that you are not trying to open a binary file.
[05:11] <elfreakz> Select a character coding from the menu and try again.
[05:11] <elfreakz> ?
[05:11] <boink> it can cope with many applications.
[05:11] <boink> VMWare is quite well done
=== Trixsey is now known as another_nick
[05:11] <jrib> ubotu: tell elfreakz about java
[05:12] <drkm> boink: can u give me an example of a big application it can cope with so i can compare it to the poker clients
[05:12] <boink> no
[05:12] <drkm> boink: you don't know any or you don't want to give me an example?
[05:12] <boink> No, I don't know.
[05:12] <kwood> after attempting to 'startx' i get the following errors. screens found but none have a usable config and then below that fatal server error: no screens found.. any ideas? anyone/

[05:13] <jrib> elfreakz: did you receive a private message from ubotu?
[05:13] <elfreakz> jrib, oh sorry i didnt relise its there...
[05:13] <boink> I use iso images when I install new OS's to VMWare
[05:13] <jrib> elfreakz: it tells you how to install java
[05:14] <drkm> boink: thanks
[05:14] <elfreakz> jrib, do u know about my sound problem? that annoying sound which i dont know if it is come from irc or not.. like beeping
[05:14] <drkm> boink: you can install directly from a iso rather than burning it to cd? as that would suit me more
[05:14] <boink> yes, you can install straight from the iso file
[05:14] <jrib> elfreakz: what client do you use for irc?
[05:14] <boink> that's really handy
[05:14] <elfreakz> jrib, Xchat
[05:15] <elfreakz> jrib, is it the system sound or irc?
[05:15] <qkslvrwolf> kwood: have you check /etc/X11/xorg.conf to make sure your video card supports a resolution listed there?
[05:15] <qkslvrwolf> *checked
[05:15] <drkm> boink: ah great.. you just saved me about 50 hours of pain
[05:15] <Elendil> Umm yea...i just installed the alternate version of ubuntu, and when i boot up to the desktop after i logon, the graphics are all sketchy and i cant see anything
[05:15] <jrib> elfreakz: probably irc, check preferences.  I don't know xchat that well so I'm not sure
[05:15] <kwood> qkslvrwolf: nope... will check it out
[05:15] <drkm> is it still best practise even with ubuntu not to use your root account, but make another account as use that?
[05:15] <elfreakz> jrib, what client u r using?
[05:16] <jrib> elfreakz: irssi
[05:16] <rever> ReWT_AxS, have you tried using alsaconfig
[05:16] <Yggdrasil> can somone help me connect to a cups printserver from my ubuntu laptop?

[05:20] <schisms> http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX
[05:20] <qkslvrwolf> Is there a way to mandate what scsi device a usb disk is assigned when plugged in?  Mine keeps switching between sda and sdb which is jacking up my fstab...
[05:20] <boink> because gnome is quite demanding
[05:20] <boink> xfce is a lighter desktop
[05:20] <Elendil> how do i install the xfce desktop?
[05:20] <Elendil> and
[05:20] <boink> xubuntu-desktop - Xubuntu desktop system

[06:01] <washbear> argghh - something keeps changing the IP of  my eth1 (which is set to share i-net with starter), as if there was an AVAHI/Bonjour demon running (it happened after testing Gobby), but have removed all DND auto-discover / auto-ip packages - when restarting the network eth1 gets its assigned IP and two second later reverts to something in the 169.254.x.x range (all was well with this setup before trsting Gobby) -

[06:07] <LjL> Music_Shuffle1: bit too harsh? well, it's annoying when you get a ton of IRC highlights while you're trying to write stuff :P
[06:07] <nn> eilker: /8 would be 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, /24 would be 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255

KScreenCapture.  vncrec or vnc2swf (produces flash animation).....I'm just not sure if any of them are easy to put a sound track to.

[06:21] <robdeman> Im installing Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server. What is the difference bwteen 'install to harddisk' or 'Install a LAMP server' ?
[06:22] <nn> robdeman: LAMP == Linux Apache MySQL PHP
[06:22] <robdeman> n I know
[06:22] <robdeman> but what is the difference?
[06:22] <drkm> lol
[06:22] <frogzoo> robdeman: lamp server sets up apache/mysql/php during the install as extra
[06:22] <fbc> ColonelZarkawi:  That what I was stating.
[06:22] <robdeman> Insta;; to harddisk does not install LAMP?
[06:22] <robdeman> ok
[06:22] <webmaren> how do i make the sound higher when playing a dvd in ogle?
[06:22] <robdeman> thats what I want then
[06:22] <ColonelZarkawi> whatever
[06:22] <robdeman> does it recognzie RAID's ?
[06:22] <kerik> drkm: are you just wanting to install a workstation?
[06:22] <nolimitsoya> robdeman, it might

[06:23] <fbc> oops..  How many people here are using evolution for mail?
[06:23] <kerik> drkm: cause I have never done it before and I chose the OEM...30 min later I was done..
[06:23] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | fbc
[06:23] <ubotu> fbc: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?

[06:23] <ColonelZarkawi> fbc, it doesn't matter
[06:23] <ColonelZarkawi> fbc, if you have a problem with evolution, ask your question.
[06:23] <drkm> kerik: are there different install types?
[06:23] <robdeman> I have this Server http://www.tyan.com//products/html/gs12b5103_spec.html
[06:23] <kerik> drkm: yeah....there are the OEM and a server version
[06:24] <robdeman> any tips for drivers etc?
[06:24] <webmaren> how do i raise volume in ogle?
[06:24] <fbc> What do evolution users recommend for spam filtering???
[06:24] <drkm> kerik: is the difference that server just comes with apache etc as default?
[06:24] <A3n> !rpm
[06:24] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)

[06:26] <robdeman> hey guys I have a raid mirror (2x 120 GB) .. what partitions hsould I make?
[06:26] <kerik> drkm: no problem :)
[06:26] <drkm> ok
[06:26] <nolimitsoya> fbc, i have no idea :) try the wiki
[06:26] <drkm> back in however long it takes me to sort out :)
[06:26] <A3n> is there a safe way to install .rpm's ?
[06:26] <nolimitsoya> A3n, no
[06:26] <HumanPrototype> fbc, i think you need to install spamassassin but check that
[06:26] <kerik> :)
[06:26] <frogzoo> !alien | A3n
[06:26] <ubotu> A3n: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[06:26] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, A3n thats not a safe way

[06:26] <kerik> drkm: I am still trying to learn the commands in linux...16 years of DOS and Windows dont help you here ;)
[06:27] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, A3n thats a way, but a way that should be avioded at all cost
[06:27] <olaf_b> Hey, what was the command that allows to register and chat on PRIV?
[06:27] <Music_Shuffle1> Hence the 'but its quite dangerous'.
[06:27] <fbc> HumanPrototype:  I did but it seemed to do no good after training it against 1124 spam emails. I'm in the process of trying BOGOFILTER, while I findout what really works..
[06:27] <A3n> k so there is no way i can install limewire pro safely ?
[06:27] <citriz> question: is there an easy way to make iso's under linux?
[06:27] <citriz> like, to compress a dir to an iso
[06:27] <robdeman> also: if my hardware RAID is set to MIRROR, then shoul dit show up as 1 harddrive to Ubuntu installer? Now I am seeing 2 harddrives (/dev/sda and /dev/sdb)
[06:27] <nolimitsoya> citriz, try mkiso
[06:27] <HumanPrototype> fbc, i think spamassassin is a service so it will need configuring
[06:27] <citriz> ok
[06:28] <citriz> do i apt-get it?
[06:28] <HumanPrototype> rob, create a partition on each drive of equal size and set it as raid
[06:28] <A3n> !zip
[06:28] <ubotu> Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde) - also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[06:28] <HumanPrototype> rob, sorry - that was for robdeman
[06:28] <citriz> maybe not, it didn't work.
[06:28] <HumanPrototype> robdeman, , create a partition on each drive of equal size and set it as raid
[06:28] <fbc> HumanPrototype:  I can't wait for evolution to have a built-in bayesian with 'spam' and 'not spam' buttons like thinderbird for us noobs.

[06:32] <Trixsey> streaming video over the network (from windows server to ubuntu) doesn't seem to work for me either
[06:32] <Music_Shuffle1> (It might relate to something I -want- to do)
[06:32] <greg> nvidia 5900
[06:32] <Trixsey> I have to download them first :/
[06:32] <nolimitsoya> !nvidia | greg
[06:32] <ubotu> greg: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:32] <nn> Music_Shuffle1: "something" keeps mounting my phone's harddrive every time i get near my computer
[06:33] <Music_Shuffle1> nn, rofl! Ok, then no, its not anything I wanted to be able to do. xd
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> nn, shut off bluetooth on your phone
[06:33] <dabaR> nn: gnome-volume-manager
[06:33] <Music_Shuffle1> Well, he might WANT Bluetooth >.>
[06:33] <nn> dabaR: Eh? :)
[06:33] <nn> nolimitsoya: yea, i kinda need that or i cant talk to people
[06:33] <fbc> citriz:  if they are just use port 80 for UDP. Network administrators rarely block UDP on port 80.
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, then he will have tolive with the fact that everyone can mount his phone :)
[06:33] <nn> it only works with a headset
[06:33] <Music_Shuffle1> Hehe
[06:33] <citriz> hm
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> nn, can you necrypt it?
[06:33] <Music_Shuffle1> Ok. My turn to have a question.
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> *encrypt
[06:34] <A3n> so for limewire i need multiverse and java
[06:34] <Music_Shuffle1> Does Ubuntu flip out if you hotswap hard rdrive?
[06:34] <nn> nolimitsoya: it's only to things it's peered with before
[06:34] <Music_Shuffle1> A3n, yeah.
[06:34] <citriz> hm. i just set up frostwire, and it doesnt show a user interface.. just a blank window
[06:34] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, no, hotswaping is fine
[06:34] <Music_Shuffle1> As long as its secondary drive?S
[06:34] <Music_Shuffle1> drives**
[06:34] <frogzoo> citriz: did you install java?
[06:34] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, provided you controller and drives supports hotswaping, youre in the green
[06:34] <J03> Anyone? Good PHP Editors?
[06:34] <nolimitsoya> *your
[06:34] <citriz> java should be installed
[06:35] <ColonelZarkawi> J03, emacs
[06:35] <citriz> let me check
[06:35] <J03> Ok :D
[06:35] <citriz> well im running azureus just fine
[06:35] <citriz> thats java correct?
[06:35] <J03> Well, i was acctually looking for somthing like dreamweaver. is eMacs like that?
[06:35] <Music_Shuffle1> I have a 320 main drive that will always be attached, I want to be able to..shut down, and cold swap harddrives into slots 2-4 pretty much.
[06:35] <Music_Shuffle1> Will it autorecognize on boot?
[06:35] <Trixsey> I don't like emacs :p
[06:35] <A3n> !multiverse
[06:35] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[06:35] <georove1> I like bluefish for PHP
[06:35] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, you might have to reconfigure fstab unless you mount by uuid
[06:35] <Trixsey> Takes too much of an effort setting it up to ones own liking
[06:36] <synic1> .
[06:36] <A3n> how do i check if i have multiverse or not?
[06:36] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, ifnone of that made any sense, dont get into it ;)
[06:36] <ColonelZarkawi> J03, HAHAHAHA emacs is nothing like Dreamweaver no!!!!
[06:36] <synic1> .
[06:36] <boston`> hello
[06:36] <citriz> why use dreamweaver?
[06:36] <J03> lol :( oh
[06:36] <Music_Shuffle1> Lol. No no, I got it...except...its the 'how' that I'm unclear on for fixing fstab.
[06:36] <fabsys> someone have one idee for this compilation problem ? (http://fr.pastebin.ca/274346)
[06:36] <J03> because i like dreamweaver!
[06:36] <ColonelZarkawi> citriz, ask J03, he uses dreamweaver
[06:36] <fbc> J03:  try NVU...
[06:36] <fabsys> plz
[06:36] <citriz> lol
[06:36] <georove1> can anyone help with keyboard config?
[06:37] <J03> fbc: I was just downloading that :P
[06:37] <citriz> i used to use it.. i was a webdesigner for a company for a couple years
[06:37] <Music_Shuffle1> !ask
[06:37] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:37] <ColonelZarkawi> citriz, is good
[06:37] <J03> can you do PHP Wit it?
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, you have tomake sure your devices always match your fstab. if you move a device itll have a diffrent "label", fex.
[06:37] <citriz> too simple for me. even then i had the all code setting on
[06:37] <J03> hmm...
[06:37] <A3n> J03: you can php with text-editor lol
[06:37] <J03> I wonder if Wine works with DreamWeaver..
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, say you mount hda as /. if you move hda to primare slave, its now hdb. that will cause headache
[06:37] <synic1> ctrl-J
[06:37] <J03> Yes, but i like the coloured text :D
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> *primary
[06:37] <citriz> try it J03
[06:38] <J03> I will do :D
[06:38] <citriz> you could get a text editor which colors your syntax
[06:38] <fbc> J03:  Great! It's not all the stuff that dreamweaver is, however if you've used dreamweaver you can probably work your way around NVU. NVU really has a long way to go as far as usability and feature compared to Dreamweaver.
[06:38] <A3n> so you want dreamweaver just because it colours your text ?
[06:38] <georove1> how do I get an Apple Pro KB to work- specifically the quote keys. I have to hit the key 2x, but bash does not like the char that results
[06:38] <Music_Shuffle1> nolimitsoya, hda will always be primary master, its just the secondary-tertiary drives that I'll be switching out as they fill up.
[06:38] <ColonelZarkawi>  J03 emacs supports syntax highlighting
[06:38] <fbc> J03:  Worse case scenario I've heard of people running dreamweaver under wine.
[06:38] <J03> Yeah
[06:38] <J03> I've just got wine.
[06:38] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, i was explaining the principle. adapt it
[06:39] <citriz> wose case ^
[06:39] <J03> Well, ive just got linux ^^
[06:39] <citriz> J03 try Scream
[06:39] <Music_Shuffle1> Right. So it won't just automount and be all happy.
[06:39] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, yes itwill. or might.
[06:39] <J03> Ok.
[06:39] <J03> Its that in synaptic?
[06:40] <citriz> i mean screem
[06:40] <itch^> Hello guys. Can somebody give me hand with a problem regading a kernel compilation. Each time i try to complile the kernel, I get this error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36286/
[06:40] <Music_Shuffle1> Hmm.  But if it doesn't, I need to tinker with the fstab setup?
[06:40] <VividHazE> Hey what command do I type into a terminal to get it to tell me my kernel version?
[06:40] <georove1> vivid- trey uname
[06:40] <synic1> df
[06:40] <fbc> J03:  Well, I've just converted over from Xp to Ubuntu, and I like it better. However not being able to find suitable replacements for a few of my favorite apps is a little disconcerting, but you will eventually figure out work arounds like I did. However, it's really nice to be free from microsoft.
[06:40] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle1, if you mount by uuid right now things will get messy if you replace a drive. the new drive wont mount.
[06:41] <VividHazE> uname just says "Linux"
[06:41] <georove1> sorry- uname -a
[06:41] <Music_Shuffle1> I see UUID's in the fstab, but I dunno if they're being mounted by it, or if they're just being recognized with UUID's appended.
[06:41] <A3n> where do i get multiverse repositorie or see if i have it already,
[06:41] <A3n> ?*
[06:41] <J03> Yeah - I just installed ubuntu todya.

[06:47] <jokoon> I'm currently trying to copy several files in my quake3 dir, but I can't do if I'm not root, is there some thing I can do to "unlock" temporarily these directory ?
[06:47] <honzik> You can link for my in Czech languages?
[06:47] <nolimitsoya> !root | jokoon
[06:47] <ubotu> jokoon: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:47] <glxdead> Was that forum link for me? It says to use the nvidia installer instead of ubuntu packages. Does nvidia-glx not work anymore?
[06:47] <georove1> I using an Apple Pro USB keyboard

[06:58] <VMT2007> good question I'm an fbsd man.
[06:59] <georove1> did you use the DOS setup to config the cards for interrupts and such?

[06:59] <Jayrom> I don't have it, is PCI. The card get's it interrupts and stuff but freesco says: unknow vendor and unknown card
[06:59] <ColonelZarkawi> elfreakz, try this dude https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[06:59] <Jayrom> so I searched on the internet for the vendor-id
[06:59] <ColonelZarkawi> elfreakz, and remember the command to extract the tar.gz file: tar xvzf
[07:00] <Jayrom> and found the card type
[07:00] <georove1> jayrom - can you switch it into a generic mode?
[07:00] <ColonelZarkawi> elfreakz, and don't extract files in Desktop, is messy, use another directory
[07:00] <VMT2007> you don't use the -?
[07:00] <ColonelZarkawi> elfreakz, tmp or something
[07:00] <Jayrom> how should i do that?
[07:00] <citriz> could anyone help me with mkisof?
[07:00] <dcordes> anybody on my apt-get remove vmware-player issue?
[07:00] <georove1> I note sure with PCI. My freesco hardware is ancient :(
[07:01] <SmashCat> Anyone? Is there a site with a searchable list of packages available for Ubuntu?
[07:01] <VMT2007> SmashCat
[07:01] <VMT2007> http://www.google.com/linux
[07:01] <VMT2007> check that

[07:01] <gnomefreak> SmashCat: packages.ubuntu.com
[07:02] <VMT2007> that works :P

[07:04] <Faintofhearts> Anyone care to help?
[07:04] <carpediem> ultm8: gnome doesn't take the "one tool to rule them all" approach that KDE takes.

[07:05] <SmashCat> Installer looked nice, being able to use the desktop as it installed from the live CD, but the file partitioning utils didn't give any useful options (no way to create a RAID, so it's currently only using one disk - wondered why it was so slow!)
[07:05] <VMT2007> wait a minute
[07:05] <eLfReaKz2> VMT2007, sorry got disconnected, how to install the .gz file?

[07:15] <jokoon> hello ZEN2
[07:15] <eimajenthat> Hi, I've got an mpg video file where the audio works, but the video doesn't in Totem.  I can't tell what video codec it's using, but I have gstreamer bad, gstreamer ugly, and gstreamer pitfdll, and w32codecs, any other recommendations to get this thing to play?
[07:15] <VMT2007> hmm
[07:15] <VMT2007> it looks like it comes pretty much ready to run
[07:15] <VMT2007> but
[07:15] <VMT2007> you want to install it system-wide
[07:15] <ColonelZarkawi> eimajenthat, with gstreamer it will never work. gstreamer is just useless. Have you tried totem-xine?
[07:15] <eLfReaKz2> yea
[07:15] <VMT2007> hmm
[07:15] <eLfReaKz2> VMT2007, like proper install in the programme files like in xp
[07:15] <edwardsNdallas> b
[07:16] <VMT2007> typically i'd suggest compiling it
[07:16] <VMT2007> but this doesn't appear to be open source
[07:16] <ColonelZarkawi> eimajenthat, totem-gstreamer should never been released. Is the probably one of the worst packages ever released with ubuntu
[07:16] <eimajenthat> ColonelZarkawi: I've thought about it.  I've used Xine-ui before, and found the playback to be good, though the interface confused me
[07:16] <eLfReaKz2> VMT2007, yea maybe its still new?
[07:16] <ironfroggy> im having some.. interesting CUPS problems. certain operations (putting a job on hold or cancelling it, https requests to the frontend) are causing the cups server to lock up and i have to restart it manually.
[07:16] <ColonelZarkawi> eimajenthat, with totem-xine you have the totem interface combined with the stability of xine codecs
[07:16] <ironfroggy> does anyone know where i could even look for any logs that would give me a hint about this?
[07:17] <ColonelZarkawi> eimajenthat, you should give it a try, If that doesn't work either (what I doubt) you have plenty of alternatives: mplayer, vlc, etc.
[07:17] <VMT2007> oh it is open source
[07:17] <gav616> i am a linux newbie, need alittle help in installing.
[07:17] <SmashCat> Can I just check something? Is "Edgy" (that I'm using here) a cut down version of Debian or something? Loads of packages are missing, and there's no package at all with basic stuff like mkraid! It seems like this distro is focussed on first-time desktop users? Is this right?
[07:17] <eimajenthat> ColonelZarkawi: Thanks for the heads up.  What packages do I need to be reasonably confident any given media file will play in totem-xine?
[07:17] <eLfReaKz2> VMT2007, what should i do ?
=== eLfReaKz2 is now known as eLfReaKz
[07:18] <TheGateKeeper> gav616, your specific question is?
[07:18] <ColonelZarkawi> I don't use totem-xine myself (just mplayer) but there is a libxine-extracodecs package maybe you need to install it, if not done by default by totem-gstreamer

[07:18] <eimajenthat> ColonelZarkawi: Can xine use w32codecs?
[07:19] <nn> can linux kernel do 'splice' mounts? Such that i have my 1Tb NAS mounted on /media/joseph/, i want to splice mount /media/joseph/audio-mpeg/ on /media/audio-mpeg ?
[07:19] <ColonelZarkawi> eimajenthat, sorry dude I am not sure. I know mplayer can use w32codecs
[07:19] <gav616> am using Ubuntu 6.06.. and when i boot with it and click install.. it goes to a blank screen and does nothing... i have a sata
[07:19] <ironfroggy> nn: couldnt that just be a symlink?
[07:19] <Darkster2> What is the minimum RAM required for Ubuntu?
[07:19] <nn> eimajenthat: I believe so.. either xine or toem, i forget which
[07:19] <nn> ironfroggy: Preferably not
[07:19] <VMT2007> it doesn't look like something one would install systemwide
[07:19] <VMT2007> however
[07:19] <ramzes039> witam
[07:19] <ironfroggy> nn: any particular reason why not?
[07:19] <eimajenthat> ColonelZarkawi: S'ok, thanks for the tips, I'll go RTFM on the w32codecs matter
[07:19] <eLfReaKz> hmmm
[07:20] <VMT2007> you could extract it to say, /usr/local
[07:20] <ramzes039> ja uywam indowsa
[07:20] <Darkster2> What is the minimum RAM required for Ubuntu?
[07:20] <benny_> Darkster2: 128 with xdm
[07:20] <stepanstas> hey guys
[07:20] <VMT2007> Darkster2, 256 with gnome
[07:20] <nn> ironfroggy: dealing with some particularly stupid software that does crazy stuff with symlinks
[07:20] <Darkster2> And 64 afte instal?
[07:20] <jordanau> what is the best way to get wmv files working?
[07:20] <VMT2007> although that's MINIMAL.
[07:20] <benny_> Darkster2: I thinks o
[07:20] <eLfReaKz> VMT2007, how do i extract it too /usr/local?
[07:20] <VMT2007> and desktop environments love to hog memory
[07:20] <VMT2007> eLfReaKz,
[07:20] <VMT2007> easy
[07:21] <Darkster2> Just checking, I am installing it on a low end computer for someone
[07:21] <VMT2007> go to the console
[07:21] <VMT2007> wait
[07:21] <benny_> Darkster2: you may want to use ratpoison :)
[07:21] <VMT2007> hmm
[07:21] <stepanstas> quick question: im on the java plug-in page, how do i download and install the plugin's (they are in .bin form)
[07:21] <VMT2007> you would have to put it in the PATH
[07:21] <benny_> Darkster2: doesnt look fancy, but does what it should do :)
[07:21] <A3n> stepandstas:you dont, you have synaptic for packages :p
[07:21] <VMT2007> and that's something I can't help with since it's a pain to do it system-wide
[07:21] <A3n> stepanstas: *
[07:21] <nn> ironfroggy: i suppose i can just export each directory via NFS then mount them
[07:21] <eLfReaKz> VMT2007, nevermind then
[07:22] <VMT2007> someone else could help you though
[07:22] <stepanstas> A3n: is that something i have to download?
[07:22] <ColonelZarkawi> brb
[07:22] <A3n> stepanstas: you want java right?
[07:22] <VMT2007> however
[07:22] <stepanstas> A3n: yes
[07:22] <VMT2007> flock doesn't need to be installed
[07:22] <gav616> any 1 got any idears?
[07:22] <A3n> !java | stepanstas
[07:22] <ubotu> stepanstas: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[07:22] <benny_> hm, anybody out there with an ATI Radeon and a SiS Mainboard ???
[07:22] <VMT2007> if you're the only person who is going to use it
[07:22] <eLfReaKz> VMT2007, so i can just put it anyway and run it?
[07:23] <VMT2007> just leave it in your user area
[07:23] <barosl> any good post-it program for KDE?
[07:23] <stepanstas> A3n: thanks
[07:23] <VMT2007> and make a shortcut to it on the desktop if you wish
[07:23] <eLfReaKz> VMT2007, alright thanks :)
[07:23] <benny_> did anybody of yours ever run fglrx ??
[07:23] <benny_> do you hate it :) ?
[07:23] <stepanstas> A3n: i feel dumb yet again
[07:23] <A3n> stepanstas: in other words you need to open synaptic package manager in system => administration => synaptic, click on repositories and add multiverse
[07:23] <eLfReaKz> VMT2007, do u know about upgrading from 6.06 to 6.10? will it effect my install application? do i have to download and install my application again?
[07:23] <A3n> stepanstas: i just installed java 10 minutes ago lol
[07:24] <VMT2007> oh boy
[07:24] <VMT2007> i don't even use ubuntu yet, man
[07:24] <VMT2007> i know about linux in general
[07:24] <eLfReaKz> owh
[07:24] <VMT2007> and freebsd.
[07:24] <stepanstas> A3n: ohh, so im not alone :)
[07:24] <A3n> stepanstas: after you added multiverse you can just use "search" to find java-jre5 and java sdk
[07:24] <eLfReaKz> anybody know if i upgrade ubuntu 6.06 to 6.10 will it effect my install application?
[07:24] <A3n> stepanstas: :p
[07:24] <stepanstas> A3n: thanks a lot man
[07:25] <A3n> stepanstas: np
[07:25] <stepanstas> A3n: appreasiate it
[07:25] <VMT2007> eLfReaKz,
[07:25] <gav616> i wanna try Ubuntu 6.06.. but i get just a blacnk screen when trying to install from boot
[07:25] <ColonelZarkawi> eLfReaKz, be carefull with the upgrade, edgy is known to break some things, so don't upgrade until is absoltely necessary.
[07:25] <nn> Updated mirror ubuntu/edgy from us.archive.ubuntu.com at christine/ubuntu/edgy in 849 seconds.. yay
[07:25] <ColonelZarkawi> absolutely
[07:25] <mnoir> eLfReaKz: yes - it will prolly upgrade them...
[07:25] <VMT2007> you mean if you upgrade to a newer version, your installed applications will no longer work?
[07:25] <A3n> umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu
[07:25] <eLfReaKz> ColonelZarkawi, like edgy is still beta?
[07:25] <VMT2007> that's probable in many cases
[07:25] <nn> my edgy works lovely :P
[07:25] <ColonelZarkawi> eLfReaKz, no but was/is a problematic release... too many issues to be called a stable release
[07:26] <nolimitsoya> eLfReaKz, edgy has been the stable release for quite some time now
[07:26] <dirle> :)
[07:26] <nolimitsoya> ColonelZarkawi, not by a longshot
[07:26] <ColonelZarkawi> eLfReaKz, it seems edgy has less issues if installed from scratch. but for upgrades from dapper you could have some troubles
[07:26] <eLfReaKz> wow there's too many result about edgy, 1 say not stable, 1 say stable
[07:26] <killown> anyone know what do dec server 700?
[07:26] <FireInTheAttic> wassup
[07:26] <VMT2007> eh, just go the gentoo path and compile everything.
[07:26] <VMT2007> kidding.
[07:26] <dirle> so far.. it seem stable for me <-noob
[07:26] <eLfReaKz> ColonelZarkawi, so its like i need to fresh install everything.. not upgrading method?
[07:26] <ramzes039> http://video.google.pl/videoplay?docid=4270744430057967399&q=maluch
[07:26] <ColonelZarkawi> eLfReaKz, is *stable* what I mean there are a lot of issues for people who upgrades
[07:27] <gav616> any 1 help me..or shall i go to forums for newbies?
[07:27] <VMT2007> don't get it, why do people use gentoo?
[07:27] <FireInTheAttic> haha 966 ppl
[07:27] <FireInTheAttic> and 0 ops
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> !ask | gav616
[07:27] <ubotu> gav616: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:27] <ColonelZarkawi> eLfReaKz, try to search the forums for other experiences, it depends on what you want to do. In my case edgy broke a lot of usability stuff
[07:27] <gav616> i have twice
[07:27] <FireInTheAttic> prolly quitea few who didnt opup
[07:27] <dirle> got my printer to work.. eventualy.. and I find the solution to be one that it is very hard to find

[07:33] <A3n> this is my first week here

[07:34] <blekos> hello, i got a dual boot laptop. Unfortunately i gave linux too little of free space. I have also installed a vmware (XP 3gb) and a couple of apps I like. Is it possible to take a backup of everything and put it on a new bigger parttion?
[07:34] <jtickle> have also tried changing the classpath to point to that driver, to no avail
[07:34] <zorro_> anyone tried to write to ntfs partition, I tried with some tweaking but didn't work even half way
[07:34] <nolimitsoya> blekos, yes
[07:34] <blekos> or even better can I resize the current partitions?
[07:34] <dirle> what's ntfs-3g?
[07:34] <VMT2007> A3n, Google's a pretty big contributor to the Ubuntu project from what I hear
[07:34] <nolimitsoya> dirle, its a driver that in the edgy repos. sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
[07:34] <cmweb> any way, any one got an answer to my probelm
[07:34] <nolimitsoya> dirle, then mount the partitions with -t ntfs-3g
[07:34] <mc44> VMT2007: they use it on desktops not servers, but anyhoo
[07:35] <Acu> I have a broadcom wireless card in a dell laptop - I have just upgraded the kernel to 2.6.18 which is suposedly "unpruned" and have the corresponding drivers built in - how should I install the wireless card?
[07:35] <dirle> will try it out.. ty nolmit
[07:35] <nolimitsoya> !wifi | Acu
[07:35] <ubotu> Acu: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[07:35] <blekos> nolimi, that means I have to create a new partition install ubuntu and then "install" the backup right?

[07:35] <VMT2007> oh, i thought they used it on their clusters

[07:36] <ubotu> Faintofhearts: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:36] <FireInTheAttic> help with what
[07:36] <VMT2007> my first guess was that Google ran FreeBSD on their servers
[07:36] <mc44> VMT2007: well I doubt they are using stock anything on their servers
[07:36] <Faintofhearts> Looking for help getting Q3demo to run properly.
[07:36] <VMT2007> of course not
[07:36] <Ward_> any admin here from ubuntu-nl please?
[07:37] <jtickle> anyone?  java?  openoffice?  mysql?
[07:37] <Lynoure> jtickle: just a guess: try reconfiguring openoffice.
[07:37] <Faintofhearts> Anyone think they can help me with getting Quake 3 to run smoothly?
[07:37] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, how do you think people will remember what you asked with 900ppl in the channel? if your question gone unniticed, repeat it after some time
[07:37] <jtickle> Lynoure, I found a site that mentioned going to tools, options, and setting the classpath under security... but there's no option there for it
[07:38] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, do you have the right graphics drivers installed?
[07:38] <Faintofhearts> I don't know.
[07:38] <Faintofhearts> And I don't know how to check.
[07:38] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, whats your graphics card?
[07:38] <FireInTheAttic> there is too many ppl here
[07:38] <cmweb> is ssh like a remote terminal for  remote computer, i mean can it do all the stuff that i can do right here?
[07:38] <FireInTheAttic> you should join #spelling
[07:38] <Faintofhearts> Ugh, some intel stock one.
[07:38] <Faintofhearts> I can't remember the exact model.
[07:38] <mnoir> cmweb: essentially yes
[07:39] <mnoir> it can actually do more
[07:39] <jtickle> Lynoure, and I just did a dpkg-reconfigure on openoffice.org and openoffice.org-base, to no avail
[07:39] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, then it should work at its maximum out of the box. reduce your graphics settings in q3
[07:39] <Lynoure> jtickle: it has been long time since I did anything db related on openoffice... sorry

[07:40] <_patrick> hey, can someone help me with my graphic card? - i dont know if it works well :(
[07:40] <Faintofhearts> nolimitsoya: Before I installed Ubuntu it ran fine, so I think it should still work.
[07:40] <cmweb> mnoir, Can it do a graphical desktop connection
[07:40] <FireInTheAttic> #spelling
[07:40] <Faintofhearts> None of my hardware has been changed.
[07:40] <mnoir> yes - that is what tunneling X is
[07:40] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, did you install it in ubuntu?
[07:40] <philip> hey, i need to find where gnome keeps the start up programs, i have a slight problem i need to correct, using root i can access gnome, but i need to remove a start up program for another user
[07:40] <Faintofhearts> I downloaded and installed it yesterday.
[07:41] <Lynoure> jtickle: do you have unixodbc ?
[07:41] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, and have you set up your settings?
[07:41] <Faintofhearts> My settings on the game?
[07:41] <mnoir> cmweb: you will need the server running on any machine you want to connect to
[07:41] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, yes
[07:41] <Faintofhearts> It should run fine with default.
[07:41] <Faintofhearts> With my hardware.
[07:41] <Lynoure> jtickle: http://fi.openoffice.org/vastauksia-base.html claims you need that package, too. But that page is in Finnish, unfortunately.
[07:42] <php-freak> any one have any idea why my pc would be freezing up everytime I access a certain file on my localhost through Apache? It don't happen right away, but after like 4 minutes my computer just starts to lag big time, and then eventually comes to a halt doing nothing. Its a php file, thats connecting to my mysql. I'm about half tempted to take linux out cause I've had nothing but problems with it.
[07:42] <mnoir> and I am not sure I answered the question you asked
[07:42] <dcordes> is anybody here able to explain how vmware-player is meant to be removed?

[07:42] <nolimitsoya> Faintofhearts, then try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select the right driver for your graphics card
[07:42] <mnoir> dcordes: depends on how you installed it

[07:43] <Jaak_> anyone have a tip for watching dvb(-c) like kaffeine but then a gnome app?
[07:43] <mnoir> then use apt-get or (better) synaptic to uninstall
[07:43] <nolimitsoya> dirle, i just did. mount as usual but give filesystem ntfs-3g with -t option. fex, 'sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /home/user/ntfs'

[08:03] <VMT2007> intel onboard sound
[08:03] <php-freak> yes
[08:03] <Trevinho> maybe you simply didn't have that......
[08:03] <VMT2007> that's definitely supposed to be supported
[08:04] <php-freak> thats what I thought, but the sound is not working, and its saying it is though
[08:04] <VMT2007> it's probably your mixer settings
[08:04] <pianoboy3333> Trevinho: you didn't give me an -f parameter
[08:04] <php-freak> i tried that, but let me check it again
[08:04] <php-freak> how do I get to my mixer settings
[08:04] <VMT2007> GNOME?
[08:04] <ernz> VMT2007> The phone is supported, but how in ubuntu would I say to connect to the phone and transfer files?
[08:04] <php-freak> yes
[08:04] <Trevinho> so you haven't erased anything
[08:04] <Trevinho> just
[08:04] <Trevinho> mkdir ~/.beryl/plugins
[08:04] <Trevinho> and then redo that command
[08:05] <VMT2007> applications > sound & audio > volume control
[08:05] <slop|top_> what is the command to give a user full read/write permissions
[08:06] <jrib> slop|top_: to?
[08:06] <slop|top_> jrib: to every file on my computer
[08:06] <jrib> slop|top_: use sudo
[08:06] <jrib> ubotu: tell slop|top_ about sudo
[08:06] <Turner> se
[08:06] <slop|top_> jrib: i mean...for every file in a directory
[08:06] <php-freak> i got movie player, rhythm box music player, supertine audio CD Creator, sound juice CD extractor, sound recorder
[08:06] <pianoboy3333> Trevinho: that command links /usr/lib/beryl/snowflake2.png to ~/.beryl/plugins it's not putting a link to snowflake2.png into that directory....
[08:06] <slop|top_> slop|top_: its for someone ftp'ing to me
[08:06] <slop|top_> jrib:
[08:06] <slop|top_> ^^
[08:07] <php-freak> well if i double click on my speaker at the top right, i get the volume control windows
[08:07] <php-freak> windo
[08:07] <pianoboy3333> Trevinho: was there anything important in that plugins directory?
[08:07] <beasty> lol i think my apt-crap is f*cked
[08:07] <VMT2007> php-freak,
[08:07] <VMT2007> check preferences
[08:07] <php-freak> yes
[08:07] <VMT2007> i don't use ubuntu
[08:07] <php-freak> k
[08:07] <ernz> Does anyone know how to transfer files using bluetooth to my mobile phone? I am trying the OBEX push client, but it doesn't seem to recognise any bluetooth hardware.
[08:08] <Trevinho> sorry pianoboy I forgot a slash
[08:08] <Trevinho> add
[08:08] <Mwa> When I run the alternate installer for ubuntu, every key I press prints twice. This also happens when I use a USB keyboard. How do I stop this happening? I am using a White 2GHz intel based Macbook.
[08:08] <php-freak> external amplifier is unchecked
[08:08] <Trevinho> ~/.beryl/plugins/
[08:08] <VMT2007> check it
[08:08] <jrib> slop|top_: well  chmod 777 /some/file   will give everyone read write and execute permissions.  Don't use this command on system files and directories, you will break your system.  If you wanted the command to affect a directory and everything in it, you would want it to be recursive, like so:  chmod -R 777 /path/to/dir
[08:08] <php-freak> k
[08:08] <jrib> ubotu: tell slop|top_ about permissions
[08:08] <php-freak> i did
[08:08] <VMT2007> try to play a sound
[08:08] <Trevinho> piano, if you didn't put a plugin there, there are no plugins in that folder
[08:08] <Trevinho> anyway, REPEAT... YOU DON'T HAVE DELETED ANYTHING!
[08:08] <VMT2007> and raise the master setting all the way up
[08:09] <VMT2007> same with PCM
[08:09] <Trevinho> maybe simply you didn't have that dir
[08:09] <pianoboy3333> Trevinho: ah, ok
[08:09] <php-freak> hold on trying to find a sound to play
[08:09] <VMT2007> php-freak: is it working
[08:09] <VMT2007> oh
[08:09] <slop|top_> jrib: when he tries to drag and drop a file from my computer to his via ftp, it only copies a link to the file, not the actual file
[08:09] <pianoboy3333> ... still doesn't work...
[08:09] <slop|top_> jrib: does that sound like a permissions problem?
[08:10] <jrib> slop|top_: no, what program is he using?
[08:10] <php-freak> im playing the radio, but getting no sound
[08:10] <slop|top_> jrib: firefox's ftp (windows)
[08:10] <tuv> is there any other installer than the live cd for edgy?
[08:10] <VMT2007> hmm
[08:10] <VMT2007> raise the player's volume
[08:10] <php-freak> i tried
[08:10] <pianoboy3333> Trevinho: do I have to do anything else except put the png in that folder?
[08:10] <VMT2007> raise all the mixer settings
[08:10] <VMT2007> rather
[08:10] <jrib> slop|top_: that sounds like a firefox's ftp behavior
[08:10] <VMT2007> message me
[08:10] <VMT2007> and give me the name of each setting
[08:11] <Jaak_> is there a gnome dvb viewer app?
[08:11] <jrib> slop|top_: ask him to try a different client and see if it still happens
[08:11] <slop|top_> jrib: ok, thanks
[08:11] <VMT2007> Jaak_: DVD?
[08:12] <Jaak_> vmt2007 no dvb(-c)

[08:27] <judgen> !glxgears
[08:27] <ubotu> To display the FPS in glxgears, run 'glxgears -printfps' in a terminal.

[08:27] <gop> nope
[08:27] <gop> altough it the system is up, I was able to vnc to it
[08:27] <dm_> just a quick problem.. my bnc uses ident as the user name.. do i have to install identd to remove the ~ from infront of my ident?
[08:27] <gop> but then again all i see is black screen
[08:28] <webmaren> i need help setting up 1200x800 on edgy, i already reconfigured xserver to recongnize it, but it doesn't show up in my screen resolution controls
[08:28] <frying_fish> webmaren: what is your graphics chipset?
[08:29] <nouri> When I start up with my USB harddrive connected, Ubuntu will have it mounted as /media/sdb5.  When I hotplug it, it will show up as /media/usbdisk, which confuses all my programs which expect stuff to be at /media/sdb5, not usbdisk.  How can I fix this.  The only entry in /etc/fstab is for sdb5.  I have no idea where that usbdisk comes from.
[08:29] <frying_fish> nouri: that usbdisk comes from pmount
[08:29] <webmaren> frying_fish: ati radeon x550
[08:29] <fl1> i'm expereencing problems with the log in after a suspend to disk , my keebord doesn't seem to function animor when i restart the pc , all this after the last upgrade first it all worked perfectly , anyone has a clue on whats hapening?
[08:29] <frying_fish> and you could change it by making a udev rule.

[08:29] <gop> ironfrog the mintor don't see to do jack
[08:29] <frying_fish> webmaren: ok, pass then, I thought it may be an intel chipset at which point I knew how to do it.
[08:30] <dm_> does anyone know how to enable ident for xchat.. or do i have install identd??
[08:30] <gop> ironfrong I unpluged the monitor and connect to my linux server

[08:36] <BigCanOfTuna> wasabi: thanks.

[08:36] <ubotu> davidjoho: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[08:37] <cmweb> Kingsqueak, Im on dialup, so the local interact and the ppp
[08:37] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: o.k. try 'firestarter' should do the trick for you, you may need to start it after the dialup is started would be the only trick, not sure if it's 'smart' enough by default to do that
[08:37] <davidjoho> jeez. the bot's got a thin skin. The humans didn't have an answer, so I asked the bot twice...
[08:38] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: just tell firestarter that ppp0 is your external interface
[08:38] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  i got firestarter installed but it wont do anything
[08:38] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: you try the docs on the firestarter site yet?
[08:38] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  i told it to do sharring but im still in the dark about the client systems as it what to do on thm
[08:39] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: http://www.kingsqueak.org/stuff/basic_network.png  the 'firewall/router' is your system with firestarter on it
[08:39] <BigCanOfTuna> How can I tell if one of my init.d scripts loaded at boot, or, the reason it failed while trying to boot?
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: the default gateway for your inside machines is whatever address you make for the either blue or green links shown, generally say 192.168.1.1 as an example
[08:41] <ryanakca> when bug reporting... I have about 5-6 backtraces and straces... should I upload the gzipped tarball to launchpad? or the individual files?
[08:41] <cmweb> Kingsqueak, My current set up is the client computer is 192.168.0.2 and the gateway (me) is 192.168.0.1 but i think firestarter wants DHCP which i have it installed but it wont detect it
[08:42] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: firestarter will only care because it's opening ports for services connections, 'dhcp' on it means either dhcp over the WAN/internet connection or facing the inside for dhcpd connections from your clients

[08:43] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: can you resolve DNS from that client machine 'nslookup google.com' ?

[08:44] <Music_Shuffle1> Then I have no idea...sorry. >_<
[08:44] <Thialfihar> I'm experiencing extremely slow DNS resolving times (at least I think that's the bottleneck)... but only at the terminal with things like lynx or urllib in Python. Firefox is nicely fast. Anyone got an idea what's up with that?
[08:44] <Mwa> Music_Shuffle1, It all works in live CD mode, and during the boot choices menu. It's just during the installer that it does this
[08:44] <Thialfihar> At first it was slow for everything... and I disabled IPv6 for that.
[08:44] <dm_> how do i get an install windows fonts for ubuntu?
[08:44] <Mwa> It's also intermittent. Sometimes keys doubletype, sometimes they only singletype

[08:44] <tuv> is there any other installer than the live cd for edgy?

[08:45] <philo23> hey, i'm having some problems with beryl, upon running it, it crashes my whole system, so i have to restart
[08:45] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  it times out
[08:45] <ubuntu_> im trying to mount my hard disk form live cd so that the hd icons on my desktop,its hd1 by the way
[08:45] <barosl> any good post-it program for KDE?
[08:45] <tuv> the live cd is too much for an old laptop here. it takes an hour to boot to X and then gets stuck. can i install without running X while installing?
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: o.k., DNS works on the firewall machine though right?
[08:45] <ubuntu_> could someone please give me  a shell comand?
[08:45] <Music_Shuffle1> !automatix
[08:45] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[08:45] <cmweb> um, one sec
[08:45] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  yes
[08:46] <Mwa> tuv, try the alternate install CD?
[08:46] <Music_Shuffle1> tuv, pretty sure you can...alternate is text-based apparently.
[08:46] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  i did nslookup then google.com and it gave result
[08:46] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: o.k. set the DNS servers on the client to the same ones as the firewall machine, they are in /etc/resolv.conf
[08:46] <ubuntu_> !worksforme
[08:46] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[08:46] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: then try DNS again on the client
[08:46] <redbluemangle> hey I need some permissions help
[08:46] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  you do relize that the client is a windows
[08:46] <vaibhav> ubuntu dapper does not have make

[08:47] <ryanakca> when filing a bug report on launchpad, should I put all the (5-6) backtraces into a tarball, or upload them individually?
[08:47] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: only matters how you go about setting DNS
[08:47] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  the dns on the client is set to 192.168.0.1
[08:47] <joefso> vaibhav, so ? apt-get install $software
[08:47] <cmweb> Kingsqueak,  its been set like that
[08:47] <ubuntu_> could someone give me a shell comand please? im trying to mount my hard disk form live cd so that the hd icons on my desktop,its hd1 by the way
[08:47] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: well if 192.168.0.1 doesn't have a DNS server, that won't work, try setting it to whatever your firewall has in /etc/resolv.conf for 'nameserver' entries

[08:51] <SlicerDicer-> am I able to use remote desktop on ubuntu livecd?
[08:51] <ubuntu_> you can use ssh

[08:52] <cmweb> kingsqueak, it works now thanks to you! Thanks
[08:52] <tuv> i'll try the alternate cd, but why would the live cd boot and start X then completely freeze on the orange screen with nothing on it? 128MB ram here
[08:52] <SlicerDicer-> ubuntu_: I am trying to remote it with vnc but that does not seem to work at all?
[08:53] <ubuntu_> !vnc
[08:53] <ubotu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[08:53] <Thialfihar> lynx -source 'http://209.85.129.104' happens almost instantly and lynx -source 'http://www.google.com' sits for 40+ seconds.

[08:54] <ouroboros_> Hello hello ubuntu commun-edy!
[08:54] <tuv> hmm.. on the website it says alternate is for systems with less than 192MB ram, although on the live cd it states 128MB is the minimum requirement

[08:55] <air0day> i did chmod -R 0666 on a ton of files
[08:55] <ubuntu_> could someone give me a shell comand please? im trying to mount my hard disk form live cd so that the hd icons on my desktop,its hd1 by the way
[08:55] <air0day> and now they all seem to be deleted
[08:55] <SlicerDicer-> no problem ubuntu_
[08:55] <air0day> i did it on a folder at the top level, thinking it would give everyone read/write
[08:55] <air0day> but im guessing that first 0 turned off all read
[08:55] <air0day> is there a way to get them back?
[08:56] <rainbowjoshua> So I am trying to get working this "Logitech Quickcam Fusion"... it's listed on the uvcvideo site as supported, and when I plug it in it is seen, but no works... anyone got any ideas?  The forums have proved inefected.
[08:56] <mcscruff> i have a folder called storage and inside there are folders and files with mixed permissions, is there a command to set everything inside so my user can edit/create/delete etc
[08:56] <air0day> please. i really really need help. linux may have just deleted 500 gigs of really really important files
[08:56] <air0day> if anyone has the time to help me, i really really need it. a lot
[08:57] <Kingsqueak> mcscruff: you can use 'find' as in   'find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;'
[08:57] <Kingsqueak> mcscruff: that sets all dirs from . down to 755
[08:57] <mcscruff> Kingsqueak, i'll have a go
[08:57] <Kingsqueak> mcscruff: you can use 'find' as in   'find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;'  would do files to 644
[08:57] <air0day> kingsqueak, can you help me?
[08:58] <air0day> i think i set the read byte to zero on a ton of files and i need to get them back
[08:58] <Kingsqueak> air0day: what I just told mcscruff would also work for that, what sort of files?
[08:58] <defend> hi all was woundering if any one could offer some advise i have a fujitsu 64bit laptop and when i put in a dvd it freezes i think it is a acpi issue and i am not sure were to even start i have installed the newwest linux-sources but it still happens
[08:58] <air0day> everything i have on my computer
[08:58] <Kingsqueak> air0day: that's a problem because some where probably executable and you'll have to hand pick them to fix that
[08:59] <Adam_G> ok, need some help with a shell command- how can I move everything in ./foo/foo into ./foo?
[08:59] <Kingsqueak> air0day: I'd just back up data and reinstall myself
[08:59] <nn> What are some good apps for discovering APs and cracking the WEP?
[08:59] <air0day> king: not an option. these files are all documents and things ive made
[08:59] <air0day> they're SUPER important
[09:00] <Kingsqueak> air0day: so back them up and reinstall the system
[09:00] <nn> preferably console based.. i used to have this kickass app i used back in the 2.2 days
[09:00] <air0day> theres nothing to back up
[09:00] <air0day> i cant see them
[09:00] <air0day> they look like they're all gone
[09:00] <nn> i forget the name
[09:00] <nn> Kingsqueak: g'day fellow linpeopler
[09:00] <Kingsqueak> air0day: you said all files, in a directory or the whole system?
[09:00] <Adam_G> air0day, I missed the beginning of the question, but coudln't you use a bootable CD?
[09:00] <Kingsqueak> nn: kismet?
[09:00] <air0day> ugh, okay
[09:00] <air0day> i have a mount
[09:00] <vaibhav> Adam, mv /foo/foo/*.* /foo

[09:01] <Kingsqueak> air0day: 'sudo find /yourmount -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;'
[09:02] <Kingsqueak> air0day: that will get the dirs and files readable, if you had executables, you'll have to chmod them 755 once you get that straight
[09:02] <ubuntu_> so noone here knows how to mount a HD while runing a live cd?
[09:02] <dm_> is there anyway i can get my monitor refresh rate to something which come up on the list?
[09:02] <christian1222> hey guys, why would gcc not be able to find stdio.h?
[09:02] <nn> christian1222: you need libc-dev iirc
[09:03] <nn> libc6-dev, actually
[09:03] <Kingsqueak> christian1222: your system probably isn't setup to build, try 'sudo apt-get install build-esentials'
[09:03] <christian1222> Kingsqueak: thanks, ill try that
[09:03] <engla> ubuntu_: find out which disk is which and then create a folder (like /media/myhd), then sudo mount /dev/* /media/myhd
[09:04] <engla> ubuntu_: but you have to find out what /dev/* is for your hd
[09:04] <Pudel_des_Todes> hi, i have a toshiba m70-181 laptop, and ubuntu freezes in the installation process. the reason seams to be acpi, acpi=off kernel boot parameter means it will install, but then i dont have the power control tool, and the laptop is too loud...
[09:04] <christian1222> Kingsqueak: that didnt work, i got "Couldn't find package build-esentials"
[09:04] <Pudel_des_Todes> acpi_irq_balance doesn't help either. :-(
[09:04] <thenetduck> does anyone know how to un zip a folder on a web server?
[09:04] <dm_> is there anyway i can get my monitor refresh rate to something which come up on the list?
[09:04] <thenetduck> or a fiel
[09:04] <thenetduck> file*
[09:04] <engla> Kingsqueak: wouldn't "chmod -R u+rwX /yourmount" work better and faster?
[09:04] <christian1222> Kingsqueak: same when I spelled it 'essentials'
[09:05] <nn> Kingsqueak: why would i get screen artifacts when i move a locally running window (WM is running on the remote system as are 99% of my applications)? ubuntu on both systems, same version, using SSH for X forwarding
[09:05] <Kingsqueak> christian1222: sorry it's build-essential
[09:05] <Pudel_des_Todes> can anybody help, or push me to the right direction?
[09:06] <Kingsqueak> nn local network?
[09:06] <depi> what is the correct pattern to delete all images ending with _thumb.jpg in a directory which have subdirectories?
[09:06] <christian1222> Kingsqueak: thanks man, I appreciate it, if it wasnt for guys like you, I would have given up on computers a long time ago
[09:06] <nn> Kingsqueak: Yea, gigabit ether
[09:06] <Kingsqueak> nn odd, that's from lag in refresh, try a different wm maybe
[09:06] <nn> Kingsqueak: this box just doesnt have much space (1gb thumbdrive for root FS), so i run everything off the server
[09:06] <nn> Kingsqueak: hmm, maybe...
[09:06] <depi> I have tried rm *_thumb.jpg * (but not worked)
[09:07] <Kingsqueak> christian1222: no problem, I learned a lot of what I know from this network over the years
[09:08] <Kingsqueak> air0day: any luck?
[09:08] <Mwa> depi, rm *_thumb.jpg should work
[09:08] <air0day> king, kinda...
[09:08] <air0day> i think it fixed the files. when i use so, i can ls them

[09:08] <air0day> hes going to fix it
[09:08] <air0day> thanks
[09:08] <Kingsqueak> air0day: the top mount might not be 755
[09:09] <depi> Mwa: I just get rm: cannot remove `*_thumb.jpg': No such file or directory
[09:09] <Kingsqueak> air0day: the commands I gave you assume the very top /yourmount is 755 already
[09:09] <Kingsqueak> air0day: just 'sudo chmod 755 /yourmount'  see if that fixes it
[09:09] <ollekalle> .com.co")
[09:09] <ollekalle> <Kingsqueak> nn odd, that's from lag in refresh, try a different wm maybe
[09:09] <ollekalle> <nn> Kingsqueak: this box just doesnt have much space (

[09:09] <Mwa> 'ls' and make sure you're in the right directory
[09:10] <PhantomNJ> For an Athlon, which kernel should I be using under Edgy Eft?   the i386 or the generic?   I used to use the K7 kernel under Dapper
[09:10] <Kingsqueak> PhantomNJ: -generic should work
[09:10] <dm_> i've installed the ms core fonts but it doesn't include tahoma, where can i get this?
[09:10] <PhantomNJ> is one better than the other where the Athlon is concerned, Kingsqueak?
[09:10] <davro> How would i associate an avi with an application like vlc, so i can click on the file icon and vlc will open.
[09:11] <Mwa> depi, Are you in the right directory?
[09:11] <Kingsqueak> PhantomNJ: I don't believe so, they just made 'everything' kernels
[09:11] <depi> Mwa: I'm in the root directory, there I have many subdirectories where are the photos
[09:12] <ollekalle> all (again with additions): For some reason I manually need to "dhclient eth0" to get an IP address. I have added the command as post-up in my /etc/network/interfaces but it seems not to help me. I have also noticed that "sudo ifup eth0" will fail (invalid arguemnt) but still if I "sudo dhclient eth0" it works fine. Strange? Any suggestions?
[09:12] <PhantomNJ> hmmm, wonder if I should just go back to Dapper Drake where the kernel is at least tuned for the processor
[09:12] <nolimitsoya> PhantomNJ, the generic kernel is tuned. read up
=== anarki_away is now known as anarki
[09:13] <Mwa> depi, how many subfolders deep are these pictures?
[09:13] <Kingsqueak> ollekalle: likely a mistake in /etc/network/interfaces in syntax

[09:13] <Kingsqueak> ollekalle: can you pastebin your interfaces file?
[09:13] <depi> Mwa: just one subfolder
[09:13] <nolimitsoya> PhantomNJ, this has been discussed a number of times in the forum and on the mailinglists

[09:13] <ollekalle> Kingsqueak: /etc/network/interfaces?

[09:14] <TokenBad> is there a way to get xmms to play ape files?
[09:14] <Mwa> depi, make sure you don't  use -r or such, or you might rm the folders.
[09:14] <PhantomNJ> I'm on too many mailing lists as it is, nolimitsoya........I usually rely on the wiki and the docs

[09:15] <Mwa> TokenBad, ape files being Monkey's Audio, yes?
[09:15] <nagyv> could someone send me (via pastebin) a basic dapper drake sources.list file? I am helping a friend to upgrade from breezy, but I have edgy.
[09:15] <PhantomNJ> and as for why anyone would do that, I'm not sure why they changed things the way they did without putting that information front and center
[09:15] <depi> Mwa: thank you
[09:15] <TokenBad> Mwa, yes
[09:15] <Mwa> depi, you're welcome

[09:15] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: sshd should just be running, putty should work
[09:15] <TokenBad> Mwa, but this is through ubuntu
[09:15] <cmweb> kingsqueak, Then if its working what do i do with putty
[09:15] <Mwa> TokenBad, Yes. Try out that link.
[09:16] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: connect with it?
[09:16] <cmweb> kingsqueak, ive tryed that to connect to 192.168.0.1 and my firewall is set to permisive but
[09:16] <cmweb> NOThing
[09:16] <Kingsqueak> ollekalle: you don't need to have dhclient in there at all
[09:16] <Mwa> TokenBad, specificallly http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=123827&package_id=136178
[09:16] <nn> Kingsqueak: no longer using fbdev and switched to higher refresh fixes it :)
[09:16] <cmweb> kingsqueak, it says it times out
[09:17] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: use the IP if you are using a name, see if that works
[09:17] <TokenBad> Mwa, ok that is what I was about to ask...if it was that one...
[09:17] <cmweb> kingsqueak, 192.168.0.1 is what ive used
[09:17] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: then either sshd isn't listening on that IP or the firewall is still blocking it
[09:17] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: on the firewall do 'netstat -an | grep 22'  what's that show
[09:17] <ollekalle> Kingsqueak: thats the thing. I added it there since my problem is that I have to manually enter that command to get my network fully functional. Obvioulsy that solution wasn't good enogh to tackle my root problem.
[09:17] <Mwa> TokenBad, It is. :P
[09:18] <Kingsqueak> ollekalle: the 'dhcp' line in interfaces should just do that for you
[09:18] <TokenBad> answered before could ask

[09:19] <TokenBad> Mwa, thanks so much
[09:19] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: next do this and pastebin it  'sudo iptables -L'

[09:23] <Kingsqueak> ollekalle: what probably happened was, I bet you had dhclient running a few times at once
[09:23] <kupesoft> I've got an enclosure for an external drive (USB and eSATA interfaces) and a brand new, blank,drive (250gb).  What type of filesystem should I format it as for maximum portability (win32, linux, os/x, freebsd)?
[09:23] <cmweb> im goint to go ssh in
[09:23] <startswithz> how do I update my kernel?
[09:23] <snype> kupesoft  fat32
[09:23] <kupesoft> does fat32 support large filesystems?
[09:24] <nn> kupesoft: cludgily (like everything else it does)
[09:24] <godfather> hi guys
[09:24] <Pudel_des_Todes> kupesoft: it does, but afaik windows can't do it. try partition magic
[09:24] <nolimitsoya> kupesoft, no (and yes)
[09:24] <nn> i personally say give ext2 a shot with the windoze drivers
[09:24] <kerik> kupesoft: yeah it does...take it to fat32
[09:25] <kupesoft> Should I make a small NTFS partition with the windows drivers and the rest ext3?
[09:25] <kerik> as pudel said try partition magic, if you cannot do it from withing windows
[09:25] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: if you see it dropping, pastebin what the logs showed
[09:25] <Thar> having problem with installing ubuntu: although during the main installation process everything went fine, after it i suddenly noticed that installer have not created home folder and not properly recognized my hardware (including ethernet card, wich WAS configured with DHCP during installation)

[09:25] <Mwa> snype, good
[09:25] <nn> Kingsqueak: can you help me with this kismet stuff? :)

[09:25] <nn> i miss my little curses AP finder
[09:26] <Dial_tone> can someone tell me how to disable join/part messages with xchat-gnome?
[09:26] <kerik> nolimit...I never got to say thanks...but thanks for your help earlier with the DVD thing...
[09:26] <nolimitsoya> kerik, np. did things work out?
[09:27] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: hmm looks like it isn't allowing it properly

[09:27] <Pudel_des_Todes> startswithz: use adept for updating your kernel
[09:27] <RxDx> please... what program should i use to convert ogg (video) to avi or mpg?
[09:27] <kerik> nolimit: It seems to work fine :) but for some reason it lacks a little bit at times...maybe hardware issue?....I have a celeron 1,13ghz 256 ram
[09:27] <Thar> oh, and it have installed 3 kernel images (2 x default and 1 generic)
[09:28] <cmweb> kingsqueak, so the firewall
[09:28] <nolimitsoya> kerik, shouldnt be a hardware issue, as long as you are running usefull graphics drivers. you can monitorcpu and memory usage while playing if you are curious. also, a tip: pressing tab after filling in the first letters of someones nick will autocomplete it so you dont have to type it all :)
[09:29] <Mwa> When I run the alternate installer for ubuntu, every key I press prints twice. This also happens when I use a USB keyboard. This only comes into effect once I boot the installer from the CD. The CD menu works fine. How do I stop this happening? It has been suggested that the keyboard sensitivity is too high. Can I lower it with a startup argument? I am using a White 2GHz intel based Macbook.
[09:30] <kerik> nolimitsoya: now see that's a usefull tip!!!! I have had a hard time typing in all them letters all the time :)
[09:30] <jochen> where do i find the bootlocal ?
[09:30] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: hmm try 'sudo iptables -A LSI -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0/0 -j ACCEPT'
[09:30] <towel> hi
[09:30] <nolimitsoya> !hi | towel
[09:30] <ubotu> towel: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:30] <kerik> nolimitsoya: do you know where to see which videocard and which drivers I am using? - I have a feeling it's an Intel, as I am using IBM thinkpad R31
[09:30] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: that will just be temporary, but if that works, you need to make a rule in firestarter to permit connections from 192.168.0.0 to your firewall box 192.168.1.1
[09:31] <sushi_> Hmm, how do I 'pin' a package ?
[09:31] <RxDx> please... what program should i use to convert ogg (video) to avi or mpg?
[09:31] <cyzie> kerik,  in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:31] <kerik> nolimitsoya: won't you look at that:) ...I think I found it :)
[09:31] <jrib> RxDx: you could use mencoder
[09:31] <Everflex> what is it the command to check free disk space and stuff is called?
[09:31] <nolimitsoya> kerik, ah... mobile machines are diffrent beasts all together. :) there is a nice command to see your current running x driver, but i cant remember it unfortunaly...
[09:32] <Kingsqueak> RxDx: possibly ffmpeg
[09:32] <nolimitsoya> kerik, found what?
[09:32] <kerik> think I found my setup-....
[09:32] <kerik> thanks Cyzie
[09:32] <RxDx> Kingsqueak, ty
[09:32] <Kingsqueak> Everflex: df -h
[09:32] <RxDx> jrib, ty
[09:32] <Thar> guess nobody can help me... oh well ;)
[09:32] <cyzie> kerik, welcome
[09:32] <nolimitsoya> thats cheating :P
[09:33] <nolimitsoya> ;)
[09:33] <five_laptop> anybody using an xbox360 controller successfully in ubuntu?
[09:33] <Everflex> Kingsqueak: thanks :D then i can read it as a human :D
[09:33] <five_laptop> is there a tut anywhere?
[09:33] <kerik> :)
[09:33] <tate> lexmark z65, anyone had any luck getting this to work in Ubuntu?
[09:33] <cmweb> kingsqueak, no luck
[09:34] <cmweb> tate, goolg it
[09:34] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: well, it's definitely the firestarter rules, tougher to help with as it's a GUI
[09:34] <sushi_> RxDx I use transcode
[09:34] <nolimitsoya> kerik, so, does it read vesa or i810 as driver?
[09:34] <cmweb> kingsqueak, maby let me deactivate and see if it is really iy
[09:34] <J03> How do you connect to bluetooth devices in ubuntu?
[09:34] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: ah, good idea
[09:35] <sushi_> five_laptop: isn't there some sort of converter dongle?  Shouldn't you be looking for info on that dongle's use in linux?
[09:35] <kerik> nolimitsoya: I think I was wrong....I can see something but not all...
[09:35] <nolimitsoya> kerik, 'nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[09:35] <towel> hey, i have this new laptop and i just installed ubuntu.  Everything works fine except my keyboard in vi.  In the vi the backspace doesn't work and the arrow keys output a-d.   Anyone familiar to this lol?  I have a dell e1505 :[ im searching the forums but no luck of yet

[09:36] <nolimitsoya> kerik, what does it say under 'driver'?
[09:36] <luisr> Hello
=== james^ is now known as james
[09:36] <Pudel_des_Todes> towel: im no vi expert, but i think this is normal vi behaviour
[09:37] <Kingsqueak> towel: what does 'echo $TERM' tell you?
=== james is now known as njan
[09:37] <kerik> nolimitsoya: I cannot find file xorg.conf
[09:37] <luisr> Does anyone knows where can I find a Iso image for a macbook dual core
[09:37] <luisr> Kingsquek your can always type man en echo on the term
[09:38] <nolimitsoya> kerik, just cut and paste my line 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[09:38] <cmweb> kingsqueak, its not the firewall i still cant get in with it off
[09:38] <towel> Kingsqueak: if I do that in a terminal.  It doesn't output anything
[09:38] <Kingsqueak> towel: what does 'echo $SHELL' say?
[09:38] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: you sure you checked the box for 'ssh' in putty?
[09:39] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: or set port 22
[09:39] <kerik> yeah I did that..but it cannot find the file...?
[09:39] <J-_> following ubuntu guide http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29, trying to get my nvidia driver going, it says, "To use XvMC to accelerate video playback, use the following flags." then a line for xine and mplayer. Do I put both those lines in the file that I just created, or run both in the terminal?
[09:39] <cmweb> kingsqueak, its on both of them

[09:39] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[09:39] <cmweb> kingsqueak, it may be because ive install other servers for ssh
[09:39] <jordanau> i have been using ubuntu for a while now and would like to have an OS to learn linux better, should i go with slackware? gentoo? debian?
[09:39] <nolimitsoya> kerik, then you are in trouble :P
[09:39] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: open a cmd window on the windows box and do 'telnet 192.168.0.1 22'
[09:39] <nolimitsoya> kerik, look again
[09:39] <towel> odd I've used other linux distros with vi but haven't seen this.  Looks like I'm able to use vim and get around with the backspace and arrow keys
[09:40] <jordanau> #slaqckware
[09:40] <towel> must just be something with vi i guess
[09:40] <J03> vi?
[09:40] <Jeffm515> wow I hate vi
[09:40] <nolimitsoya> J03, an advanced text editor
[09:40] <towel> lol
[09:40] <kerik> nolimitsoya: it is in the terminal I should put it in the terminal
[09:40] <five_laptop> sushi_, i've got a wired controller hooked into my usb port.  I'm assuming I just need a driver for the device
[09:40] <Kingsqueak> towel: it's a TERM setting I'm pretty sure, that's where I was going

[09:40] <nolimitsoya> kerik, yes, removing the 's
[09:40] <Jeffm515> a pain in the A$%^ text editor to learn, but EXTREAMLY powerful, doesn't instert ANY extra char.
[09:40] <itsmabus> how come I can't run /sbin/backblocks on /dev/hda even though it's not mounted that I know of?
[09:41] <J03> ahh :D
[09:41] <J03> thanks
[09:41] <jrib> towel: that's not normal vi behavior
[09:41] <jrib> s/vi/vim
[09:41] <towel> yeah :( ive never seen it before
[09:41] <towel> vim works fine
[09:41] <kerik> nolimit: the s?
[09:41] <nolimitsoya> kerik, no the ' (in plural)
[09:41] <towel> but vi is strange
[09:41] <J03> Whats the best way of keeping CPU Usage down?
[09:41] <kerik> :) ohh
[09:41] <jrib> towel: oh did you install vi then?
[09:41] <Kingsqueak> J03: don't run anything
[09:41] <cmweb> kingsqueak, can not connect to the host on port 23
[09:41] <J03> lol.
[09:41] <kitche> towel: think vi on ubuntu is the easy version of vim
[09:42] <Jeffm515> lol @ king
[09:42] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: not 23, 22
[09:42] <Pudel_des_Todes> ok, seems that the computer pool i have been in last week has the same prob then you, towel *g*
[09:42] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: open a cmd window on the windows box and do 'telnet 192.168.0.1 22'

[09:42] <cmweb> oh
[09:42] <jrib> towel: sudo update-alternatives --config vi    see what you are using
[09:43] <Kingsqueak> J03: was only half kidding really , if you run 'top' it will show what is running and an idea of what resources the processes are using, you can see if something is 'stuck'
[09:43] <towel> ok
[09:43] <J03> ok, thanks
[09:43] <Kingsqueak> J03: but it's normal for things to run 99% or so while actually doing something
[09:43] <deep> j #ubuntu-se
[09:43] <kerik> nolimitsoya: cannot find file...sudo nano/etc/X11/xorg.conf in terminal?
[09:43] <Kingsqueak> kerik: space after 'nano' in that line
[09:43] <kerik> OHHH!
[09:44] <kerik> thanks kingsqueak
[09:44] <cmweb> kingsqueak, can not connect on 22
[09:44] <towel> jrib: It says there is only 1 program which provides vi.  (/usr/bin/vim.tiny).  nothing to configure
[09:44] <vcef> omg
[09:44] <vcef> how do I umount cdrom?
[09:44] <nolimitsoya> kerik, that wasnt a copy and paste. ;) i told you to copy and paste for that very reason
[09:44] <towel> i will use vim :)
[09:44] <J03> Whats the best lunix FTP client? I have fryed somthing called gFTP, but its sh** (imo)
[09:44] <kerik> nolimitsoya: TADAA!!!
[09:44] <vcef> I put in cdrw, tried to use k3b to erase it
[09:44] <vcef> and now I can't umount it!
[09:44] <morghot> hi all
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> towel: what are you in for a terminal, actual console or xterm/aterm etc.?
=== mcmahonm is now known as mcmahonm[A] 
[09:45] <jrib> towel: yeah, might want to install vim-full, though my vim.tiny doesn't do that arrow key weirdness you mentioned
[09:45] <kerik> nolimitsoya: I have it open now
[09:45] <five_laptop> ugh.... i don't want to have to recompile my kernel just to get this controller working
[09:45] <nolimitsoya> kerik, scroll down to Section "Device"
[09:45] <kerik> 2 sec
[09:46] <nn> how does one go about making Xorg in ubuntu allow switching to regular consoles? I have to fix this every time i install ubuntu and i forget where..
[09:46] <kerik> nolimitsoya: i810 as you said
[09:46] <dirle> I got ntfs-3g installed and fstab edited and still don't have write access to the ntfs partitions..
[09:46] <towel> just problems with vi but looks like vim solves the arrow keys / backspace.  They seem to be working with that
[09:46] <cmweb> kingsqueak, no connection on 22
[09:46] <nolimitsoya> kerik, then all is fine :) do some cpu and memory monitoring to see where you hit the roof
[09:46] <kerik> :) ok
[09:46] <k3_> hi
[09:46] <k3_> i have a BIG problem with feisty
[09:46] <nolimitsoya> !hi | k3
[09:46] <ubotu> k3: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:46] <towel> I have no problem using the improved version of vi i guess lol
[09:47] <kerik> can you recommend a monitor?
[09:47] <wasynyt> good evenign everyone
[09:47] <nolimitsoya> k3_, just get to it...
[09:47] <wasynyt> *evening
[09:47] <vcef> !umount
[09:47] <towel> thanks for the help :)
[09:47] <k3_> nolimitsoya: xd
[09:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about umount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:47] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: odd so 'sudo iptables -L' shows you what now?
[09:47] <wasynyt> now if just someone could tell how can i get gnome 2.16 for my 6.06
[09:47] <wasynyt> ?
[09:47] <nolimitsoya> k3_, btw, if you are a feisty user you are in the wrong channel. you should be in #ubuntu+1
[09:47] <dirle> nolimit .. I got ntfs-3g installed and fstab edited and still don't have write access to the ntfs partitions
[09:48] <k3_> nolimitsoya: thx
[09:48] <nolimitsoya> k3_, and feisty is supposed to be full of problems
[09:48] <k3_> yeah
[09:48] <k3_> i know
[09:48] <fromvega> hello
[09:48] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, feisty has a release version>
[09:48] <Arwen> ?*
[09:48] <nolimitsoya> dirle, unmount the partitions and do 'sudo mount -a'
[09:48] <dirle> done that
[09:48] <cmweb> kingsqueak, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36321/
[09:48] <ThePub> galeon ftw :)
[09:48] <Jeffm515> who here is REALLY good with bootcycles?
[09:48] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: ah, iptables is still up, your firewall is still on
[09:48] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, but its still not the stable release and therefore should be discussed in +1
[09:49] <fabiim> what does xhost + does?
[09:49] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, is it alpha, beta, rc, or pre-alpha?
[09:49] <Kingsqueak> fabiim: it allows any host to connect to your x server
[09:49] <dirle> nolimit.. I'll try again
[09:49] <k3_> alpha] 
[09:49] <cmweb> ah, ok its turned off now im testing
[09:49] <CAP4295> hello everybody!
[09:49] <livingdaylight> Hallo Jungs
[09:49] <kitche> dirle, nolimitsoya: you have to use umask to have a user be able to write to a partition without sudo I don't use umask myself so I can't really tell you how to do it
[09:49] <fabiim> Kingsqueak: thanks
[09:50] <livingdaylight> LjL, you booted me the other day - it wasn't fair, ok?!
[09:50] <Arwen> if I wanted to convert my system from ubuntu to kubuntu, what should I remove?
=== CAP4295 is now known as ubuguy
[09:50] <tuv> hmm.. on the website it says alternate is for systems with less than 192MB ram, although on the live cd it states 128MB is the minimum requirement
[09:50] <Kingsqueak> fabiim: you can do xhost + <hostname here> to permit one host
[09:50] <ubuguy> im stock!!!
[09:50] <Jeffm515> nevermind.. acpi=off .. figred it out
[09:50] <ubuguy> please helpp
[09:50] <Arwen> tuv: unless you have uber ram, live cd is slow as hell\
[09:50] <k3_> oh what the heck, i'll revert to edgy
[09:50] <jrib> ubuguy: you are "stock"?
[09:50] <k3_> f*
[09:50] <livingdaylight> now, i want to copy a whole bunch of text from a website and paste it somewhere to edit, what is the best way please? i tried copy and paste it in OO.o it doesn't work
[09:50] <Arwen> and even with uber ram, its limited by your cdrom drive
[09:50] <rsteele> sup?
[09:51] <ubuguy> jaja yeah jrib
[09:51] <jrib> livingdaylight: how did you try to copy and paste?
[09:51] <jrib> ubuguy: what do you mean?
[09:51] <Slart> livingdaylight: didn't work? how? what did you expect? what did you get?
[09:51] <livingdaylight> jrib, the normal highlight right-click and paste
[09:51] <cmweb> kingsqueak, that worked im in
[09:51] <Kingsqueak> livingdaylight: you can select it and drag it to your desktop and it will make a file for you
[09:51] <fabiim> Kingsqueak: well i don't know what host i want to allow , I was editing crontab to perform DISPLAY=:0 amarok -p  and Xlib wasn't allowing , so i found that "xhost +" on google try it out and it work ...
[09:51] <ubuguy> [jrib]  im just talk a wrong inglish
[09:51] <kerik> nolimit: can you recommend a monitor?
[09:51] <jrib> livingdaylight: did you "copy" after highlighting?
[09:51] <Slart> livingdaylight: hmmm.. that should work.. hold on.. I'll try
[09:52] <cmweb> kingsqueak, what is the port i need to open up 22? i dont see why because its on passive
[09:52] <livingdaylight> jrib, yes, of course then into openoffice right-click then paste
[09:52] <nolimitsoya> kerik, monitor?
[09:52] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: k, then you have to add a rule with firestarter to allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.0.1 on port 22 tcp or 'ssh'
[09:52] <livingdaylight> i only got one line
[09:52] <livingdaylight> maybe i was trying to copy too much text?
[09:52] <Kingsqueak> kerik: how much can you spend and how big do you want?
[09:53] <kerik> nolimitsoya: monitor for system.. things
[09:53] <jrib> livingdaylight: try highlighting and then middle clicking to paste, does that work?
[09:53] <Slart> livingdaylight: it worked here.. what's the url you tried to copy?

[09:54] <root> Slart: i could try unplugging the computer and pluggin it back up
[09:55] <fromvega_> I'm trying to edit ip_forward file but I can't even with sudo!
[09:55] <kerik> nolimitsoya: so in the applets?
[09:55] <nn> Jeffm515: np
[09:55] <root> fromvega: what are you trying to edit it with? kate? kwrite?
[09:55] <Slart> livingdaylight: ok.. just cpy paste only pasted the first line... paste special, without formatting worked though.. try it.. it's in the edit menu
[09:55] <livingdaylight> kitche, what is .asp format?
[09:55] <nolimitsoya> kerik, yes, but the "big one" might be easier to read
[09:56] <ubuguy> ALGUIEN QUE HABLE ESPAOL????
[09:56] <Slart> root: unplugging the computer? I dont understand...
[09:56] <jrib> !es | ubuguy
[09:56] <ubotu> ubuguy: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[09:56] <livingdaylight> Slart, that is what i got only the first line, what did you do different?
[09:56] <Sapote> sudo `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
[09:56] <root> Slart: it fixes most things
[09:56] <Slart> livingdaylight: use "paste special" instead of paste
[09:56] <fromvega_> root: gedit
[09:56] <kerik> nolimitsoya: It doesnt seem to be present...?
[09:56] <ubuguy> THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!1
[09:56] <root> Slart: or a hammer. eitherone
[09:56] <root> fromvega: try nano
[09:56] <kerik> nolimit: or am I looking wrong places?
[09:56] <fromvega_> Sapote: no permission even with SUDO
[09:57] <Slart> root: ah.. yes. =) but in my case the only problem was the DVD-drive.. after that, it booted fine
[09:57] <nolimitsoya> kerik, im not on gnome so i cant check, but look for 'system monitor' or something similar under system->administration
[09:57] <kitche> livingdaylight: it's frontpage extension but the file you want to edit is in .txt format discourse+seriesthe goose is out.txt it's even in the url
[09:57] <meeow> lo, i'm trying to install 6.10 desktop. i get an error i/o not enough memory to load specified kernel
[09:57] <fromvega_> Sapote: I've tried that but it says I have no permission
[09:57] <kerik> nolimitsoya: will do :)
[09:57] <root> frombega: do sudo nano <filename> in a terminal
[09:57] <root> fromvega: do sudo nano <filename> in a terminal
[09:58] <livingdaylight> Slart, i don't see a "paste special"
[09:58] <jrib> livingdaylight: in your edit menu
[09:58] <livingdaylight> kitche, huh?
[09:58] <Sapote> sudo vi sysctl.conf
[09:58] <root> meeow: how much ram do you have
[09:58] <fromvega_> ok
[09:58] <meeow> how do i install it with running ubuntu from cd
[09:58] <Slart> livingdaylight: in open office.. edit menu.. just below "paste" ?
[09:58] <livingdaylight> jrib, edit menu of openoffice?
[09:58] <jrib> livingdaylight: yes
[09:58] <meeow> without*
[09:58] <kerik> nolimitsoya: it is already installed :)...and working...thanks mate!
[09:58] <meeow> more than the recommended 128
[09:58] <nolimitsoya> kerik, np
[09:58] <root> you really need atleast 512
[09:59] <livingdaylight> Slart, jrib, cool, thx guys!
[09:59] <cmweb> kingsqueak, looks like it works now thanks a bunch
[09:59] <kerik> nolimitsoya: it is > 50% in everything :)
[09:59] <Arwen> does anyone here know what the heck a U3 flash drive is?
[09:59] <Slart> livingdaylight: np.. paste special is a life saver when pasting from the web...
[09:59] <fromvega_> root: I'm inside it, how do I save now? Not used to NANO
[09:59] <meeow> it's over 512
[09:59] <Jeffm515> nn: it's giving me permission denyed to edit menu.lst
[09:59] <Arwen> also, can fat32 partitions be resized?
[09:59] <masse|deferred> any ideas why it wont let me resize my partition ?
[09:59] <cmweb> !hi |masse
[09:59] <nolimitsoya> kerik, while playing?
[09:59] <ubotu> masse: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:59] <masse|deferred> is it because it is NTFS?
[10:00] <root> fromvega:just <ctrl x> for exit and <Y> to save changes
[10:00] <meeow> i did install the server edition previously just fine
[10:00] <nolimitsoya> kerik, if its still skipping and neither disc i/o, memory or cpu is hitting max, you should try another player
[10:00] <i7ch> Arwen, fat32 can be resized, but i don't think from within linux, just yet
[10:00] <fromvega_> root: it worked with nano, why?
[10:00] <Slart> masse|deferred: Linux doesn't really like ntfs just yet.. I dont think resizing ntfs partitions is possible...
[10:00] <i7ch> and, Arwen, U3 is some platform for running apps off flash drives
[10:00] <root> fromvega: i have no idea, but its like that for me....all i can user is nano
[10:01] <kerik> nolimitsoya: the >50% is while surfing, skyping, terminal, settings running
[10:01] <masse|deferred> so i can't install it on this machine then...not without reformatting
[10:01] <Arwen> i7ch: platform for running apps off flash drives? like..... portableapps.com?
[10:01] <Slart> masse|deferred: some time in the future perhaps.. I think they are working on it
[10:01] <root> hi, i have a problem, when i boot up all i get is a black screen with a white line in the topleft corner, the only way i can even start the computer is to go under recovery mode and startx from there, can someone please help
[10:01] <fromvega_> cool now it's 1. What else do I need now to work as a router and share the internet?
[10:01] <nolimitsoya> kerik, thats becouse of throttling
[10:01] <Arwen> i7ch: and if its not resizable from linux, is there a windows command?
[10:01] <ernz_> Can someone please PLEASE help me with Bluetooth on ubuntu before I go insane and throw my computer out of my front window and into my neighbours new Lexus?
[10:01] <kitche> Arwen: U3 is a joint venture between Sandisk and M-systems usually U3 flash drives have a program on them that can run from that drive
[10:01] <meeow> can anyone help me?
[10:01] <i7ch> Arwen, i think you need partition magic
[10:01] <kerik> nolimitsoya: throttling? - too many programs open
[10:01] <Arwen> i7ch: .......
[10:01] <Slart> I think partition magic can resize ntfs-partitions.. but that's a windows program afaik
[10:01] <nn> Jeffm515: do it as root :P
[10:01] <meeow> it claims i don't have enough memory no matter what i try. despite having over 512
[10:01] <i7ch> Arwen, it's a fancy way of describing a flash drive with an autorun that runs a menu bar with portableapps-type applications
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> kerik, your cpu throttles down when not used, so high cou usage even when just being idle is nothing to be alarmed by on a mobile
[10:02] <i7ch> Arwen, you need partition magic to resize fat32, i think
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> *cpu
[10:02] <LjL> livingdaylight: ok
[10:02] <Arwen> i7ch: so, I could just write my own autorun.inf and add my own portable apps, and it'd be the same thing? damn partition magic...
[10:02] <root> i7ch: thats a windows progran
[10:02] <Jeffm515> 3rd day with linux.. how do I edit it as root?
[10:02] <i7ch> Arwen, pretty much, i think.
[10:02] <i7ch> root, i know
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> !root | Jeffm515
[10:02] <ubotu> Jeffm515: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:02] <kitche> Arwen: U3 is good for foresentics(sp?) of a computer
[10:02] <root> qtparted is the best thing to partition
[10:03] <i7ch> !Jeffm515 | root
[10:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Jeffm515 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:03] <i7ch> :P
[10:03] <zipzo> i have connected a second harddrive, which had ntfs on it at some point, but i cant get find it or mount it, what am i doing wrong? i just want to format it
[10:03] <Jaak_> is mplayer gnome based?
[10:03] <Arwen> i7ch: time to wipe then.... the stupid u3 thing confuses gnome-mount and makes it think my usb stick is a cdrom drive
[10:03] <livingdaylight> Slart, yea, first time discovered...thx... is there not another way to easily and quickly save stuff? what is tomboy for example?
[10:03] <Arwen> Jaak_: mplayer is command line
[10:03] <i7ch> Arwen, hold on a second
[10:03] <masse|deferred> ok downloading partition magic for windwo
[10:03] <masse|deferred> s
[10:03] <maihem> I've just upgraded to edgy and installed the latest nvidia drivers and compiz. compiz is clearly working since I get cool alt-tab behaviour, but none of the key combo's for the advanced eye-candy seems to work. Any ideas?
[10:03] <livingdaylight> LjL, ok, then...
[10:03] <masse|deferred> what I really need is a new bigger hard drive
[10:03] <masse|deferred> and/or less porn
[10:03] <Slart> livingdaylight: save stuff from the web? you could always use the save command in firefox.. if that was what you meant
[10:03] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, the mplayer you get from the repos include a gui
[10:03] <dm__> Anyone have a fix for slow loading icons in the Ubuntu menu ?
[10:04] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, yep - that one is gtk
[10:04] <kerik> nolimitsoya: ohh...that might be right...although when I try to run the applet for CPU scaling, it tells me that my cpu does not support that..
[10:04] <kerik> but it will still throttle it?
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> kerik, since its a mobile it has to :)
[10:04] <ernz_> To anyone who thinks they can tackle it: I have a Sony Ericsson k750i with bluetooth enabled and device visible (Can be seen by other devices in the house) I am running Edgy 6.10 with an LM Technologies LM505 USB Dongle found and recognised. I am able to SEND files from my device to other phones and this Edgy box, but I am not able to see any devices from this computer, or pair anything to it. Can someone please respond if they have the slightest idea what mi
[10:04] <ernz_> ght be causing this? Thanks.
[10:04] <dm__> kerik powernowd scales CPUs automatically
[10:04] <Kingsqueak> kerik: do you have scaling enabled in the BIOS?  sometimes it's disabled by default, e.g. my Dell laptop
[10:04] <kerik> nolimitsoya: ok :)
[10:04] <livingdaylight> Slart, yes, from the web - a way of quickly copying and pasting for later reference or editing
[10:05] <root> hi, i have a problem, when i boot up all i get is a black screen with a white line in the topleft corner, the only way i can even start the computer is to go under recovery mode and startx from there, can someone please help
[10:05] <kerik> Kingsqueak: I actually don't know...what is that called in BIOS?
[10:05] <Slart> ernz_: sorry.. I have the same phone.. I didn't even get it to work in windows.. I haven't even tried even putting it besides my linux box =)
[10:05] <Kingsqueak> kerik: was 'scaling' in mine
[10:05] <dm__> Does anyone know how to change the color of the tooltips?
[10:05] <Kingsqueak> kerik: might also be 'hyperthreading'
[10:05] <Slart> livingdaylight: well.. you could always use a simple text editor.. gedit perhaps
[10:06] <kerik> are there anyone in here who would know which pcmcia => USB 2.0 would work in Linux (Ubuntu)
[10:06] <livingdaylight> Slart, but how do you tranfer it?
[10:06] <livingdaylight> Slart, openoffice is a bit overkill no?
[10:06] <RxDx> what program should i use to record a video of my desktop?
[10:06] <pantalaimon_> why cant i run mplayer in the background?
[10:06] <kerik> Kingsqueak: It's a celeron so hyperthreading might not be supported?
[10:06] <Slart> livingdaylight: copy/paste... just like in open office.. I havent tried it.. but it should work..
[10:06] <dm__> Does anyone know how to change the color of the tooltips?
[10:06] <Kingsqueak> kerik: ah, maybe not, mine is a core-duo
[10:06] <root> hi, i have a problem, when i boot up all i get is a black screen with a white line in the topleft corner, the only way i can even start the computer is to go under recovery mode and startx from there, can someone please help
[10:07] <kerik> Kingsqueak: That might do the trick ;)
[10:07] <ernz_> Slart: Great phone eh? Mine >>DOES<< work in Winblows, and it >>DOES<< send TO the ubuntu box, just doesn't pair at all. Do you still have the receipt ;)
[10:07] <VMT2007> root
[10:07] <Kingsqueak> kerik: yeah, sorry, you can't hyperthread a single core heh
[10:07] <VMT2007> root: it's a VERY bad idea to run an irc client as root
[10:07] <kerik> Kingsqueak: Mine is an elderly IBM thinkpad r31 celeron 1,13 256MB Ram.. :)
[10:07] <Slart> livingdaylight: ouch.. gedit didn't work at all.. sorry about that  =/
[10:07] <jrib> pantalaimon_: you can
[10:07] <root> VMT2007: i cant login as a user
[10:07] <Bergcube> I am reconfiguring an Ubuntu machine that hasn't got any GUI.  It used to use DHCP but I want to change it to using a static IP.  I've edited /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/network/interfaces  I can ping the local lan, but not the internet.  Seems to me the machine must be missing the gateway.  What file should I edit to fix that?
[10:07] <kerik> Kingsqueak: but runs linux like a dream compared to XP
[10:07] <pantalaimon_> jrib, how?
[10:07] <kupesoft> What's the good high-end laptop for ubuntu (with supported graphics card, etc)?
[10:07] <Kingsqueak> kerik: I'm not entirely sure if those older CPU's did scaling or not
[10:08] <dm__> Does anyone know how to change the color of the tooltips?
[10:08] <kupesoft> I was thinking a lenovo/ibm thinkpad t60?
[10:08] <jrib> pantalaimon_: press ctrl-z and then type 'bg'
[10:08] <thomaswebb> hi, i was wondering if anyone could help me with writing a nautilus-script?
[10:08] <Slart> ernz_: hehe, no.. I just use it to.. you know.. make phonecalls.. nothing fancy =)
[10:08] <livingdaylight> Slart, i think gedit is not the best tool
[10:08] <thomaswebb> i know what i want to do, but i don't know how to do it
[10:08] <Kingsqueak> kupesoft: I *love* my Dell 820, everything works, nvidia drivers are awesome with it
[10:08] <al> Hej
[10:08] <kerik> Kingsqueak: well...its a mobile version of the celeron - or so it says...so it should be able to scale in my logic :)
[10:08] <Kingsqueak> kupesoft: hibernate and suspend I've not fixed, but I haven't tried really either
[10:09] <Kingsqueak> kerik: you would think, I'm just not sure
[10:09] <kupesoft> Kingsqueak: I like a little IBM-style trackpoint pointer
[10:09] <Slart> livingdaylight: no.. it looks like open office is your best bet for now...
[10:09] <meeow> ok i doubt nayones interested, but i reinstalled the ram and everything seems to be fine now. very strange indeed
[10:09] <kittyhawk> hello
[10:09] <thomaswebb> does anyone know how to get the first letter of a filename when writing a bash script?
[10:09] <root> hi, i have a problem, when i boot up all i get is a black screen with a white line in the topleft corner, the only way i can even start the computer is to go under recovery mode and startx from there, can someone please help
[10:09] <VMT2007> I want to install ubuntu on this laptop
[10:09] <VMT2007> because CentOS is just too ugly
[10:09] <meeow> i didnt think ram held anything as soon as the power is turned off nayway
[10:09] <livingdaylight> Slart, do you know the tool called basket?
[10:10] <kerik> Kingsqueak: What I need to learn myself is the bloody linux commands....being used to windows and DOS for 16 years, I have to rethink everything...and it is just too logic in linux ;)
[10:10] <kittyhawk> I'm getting periodic hard lockups in X.  I'm not sure how to troubleshoot it.
[10:10] <Slart> livingdaylight: nope.. it's a text editor?
[10:10] <livingdaylight> Slart,  i just wonder if and what limit on size capacity
[10:10] <kittyhawk> I feel like it's 2002 again
[10:10] <kenny> hey guys
[10:10] <Kingsqueak> kerik: you'll get it with time
[10:10] <livingdaylight> Slart, no, its a notepad
[10:10] <VMT2007> kerik, weaning yourself from DOS is easy
[10:10] <jrib> pantalaimon_: is that what you meant?
[10:10] <kenny> im not getting any sound
[10:10] <VMT2007> kenny, mute the external amplifier in the mixer
[10:10] <VMT2007> that always does the trick
[10:10] <pantalaimon_> jrib, hm... but i had to add an >/dev/null at the end of the command
[10:10] <Kingsqueak> basically DRM will link your licensing into your actual hardware
[10:10] <kerik> Kingsqueak: yeah I hope so :). the thing is to figure where to start and end...
[10:11] <root> hi, i have a problem, when i boot up all i get is a black screen with a white line in the topleft corner, the only way i can even start the computer is to go under recovery mode and startx from there, can someone please help
[10:11] <Kingsqueak> wrong win, doh
[10:11] <pantalaimon_> jrib, because otherwise it keeps sending to the screen some messages
[10:11] <cmweb> kingsqueak, you wouldent know anything about useing a windows printer on a network would you?
[10:11] <edd_> hey. just a quick question, can you run ".run" files in Ubuntu (edgy)??
[10:11] <Slart> livingdaylight: you could always try vi or emacs btw.. and I'll look up basket

[10:15] <GenNMX> kerik: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=common+linux+commands&btnG=Google+Search <-- how about that
[10:15] <DualCortex_> Hey guys, where is it that I can see and add startup commands?
[10:15] <edd_> oh its just changed
[10:15] <GenNMX> kerik: Don't forget there are such a thing as SEARCH ENGINES.
[10:15] <kerik> kitche: It is just that I know that I can use the man command to get help to the commands..that is just bloody hard when one doesn't know the commands to man :)
[10:15] <livingdaylight> woa, LjL is in a kicking-out mood
[10:15] <thomaswebb> hmm, no help here, worked it out anywar

[10:16] <justin420> hi all. it appears my agp is disabled on ubuntu edgy. any ideas on how to enable it? when i am in /proc/driver/nvidia/agp and do "cat status" it says the status is disabled.
[10:16] <jrib> pantalaimon_: yes, there might be some switches you cna pass mplayer that might help too.  Most probably use mencoder for scripts

[10:16] <snype> RxDx if you find out--- make sure you share the info w/ me
[10:16] <livingdaylight> Slart, yea, that was a chunk of text, therefore i figured openoffice was the best tool, but for smaller text i thought maybe something easier would suit better
[10:16] <LjL> livingdaylight, if you have a problem, bring it to #ubuntu-ops - stop the questioning and sarcasm here
[10:17] <Slart> livingdaylight: yes.. for smaller texts it looks perfect
[10:17] <livingdaylight> LjL, Relax

[10:18] <Slart> VMT2007: if you need a root shell you can always do a "sudo su"
[10:18] <VMT2007> ah
[10:18] <snype> !sound | kenny
[10:18] <ubotu> kenny: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[10:18] <LjL> Slart: oh, better, sudo -i
[10:18] <Kingsqueak> or sudo -i
[10:19] <VMT2007> so the first user created is already in the sudoers file
[10:19] <VMT2007> ?
[10:19] <kerik> kitche: just seen it...even nicer! even close to being easy to look through :)
[10:19] <blue-frog> VMT2007: yes

[10:19] <kerik> any IBM users in here?
[10:19] <snype> yea!
[10:20] <Slart> VMT2007: I was kind of confused at first too.. but it works really well
[10:20] <snype> i am!
[10:20] <VMT2007> oh no I'm familiar with it
[10:20] <snype> IBM Thinkpad T42 :-D
[10:20] <kane77> RxDx, really? thats too bad...
[10:20] <VMT2007> just very used to FreeBSD
[10:20] <justin420> hi all. it appears my agp is disabled on ubuntu edgy. any ideas on how to enable it? when i am in /proc/driver/nvidia/agp and do "cat status" it says the status is disabled.
[10:20] <somerville32> My computer seems to be using OSS instead of ALSA. Should I fix this?
[10:20] <kerik> snype: finally a user of IBM :)
[10:20] <VMT2007> I haven't even been using Linux for a year..
[10:20] <kenny> ots sto;; mpt wprlomg
[10:20] <Slart> VMT2007: I mean the ubuntu way of doing it.. with no root passwd.. I used debian before
[10:20] <snype> kerik what kind of ibm u got?
[10:20] <beerman> I installed gDesklets and -data, but it seems that the gDesklets are using all my cpu - anyone with that problem, even a solution?
[10:20] <apixelatedoffice> I hate the search engine in ubuntu, I need to find this file called "version.dat" and the search feature is  is of no help... is there an easier way to search out that file?
[10:20] <kitche> geokok: either you are missing gtk+2 or glib2
[10:20] <kerik> snype: I have myself a R31...older one but working well with linux and found all drivers natively...
[10:21] <snype> yeah
[10:21] <VMT2007> beerman, make it low priority
[10:21] <kerik> snype: yet I have one or too questions..
[10:21] <snype> alright... shoot
[10:21] <snype> you can pm me if u want-- it's easier
[10:21] <blue-frog> apixelatedoffice: sudo updatedb  and then locate version.dat
[10:21] <kerik> snype: do you know how to make the middle botton on the trackpoint work properly
[10:21] <geokok> kitche: I thought gnome had gtk2 already.....how do i get them?
[10:21] <apixelatedoffice> blu-frog, will do
[10:21] <Slart> apixelatedoffice: "find" in console?
[10:21] <beerman> thx
[10:21] <pantalaimon_> jrib, i did... did it work there?
[10:21] <jrib> pantalaimon_: yeah
[10:21] <apixelatedoffice> Slart... k thx
[10:22] <kitche> geokok: it's in the repos gnome might have it but glib2 might not be pulled with gtk2
[10:22] <jrib> pantalaimon_: I did:  mplayer file  &> /dev/null < /dev/null
[10:22] <snype> kerik-- its on thinkwiki.org
[10:22] <kerik> snype: and 2nd do you know which pcmcia USB 2.0 would work on my IBM? - I have usb 1.1 only on this machine...no good when having a 300 gb usb hdd
[10:22] <RingDonut> Hey

[10:22] <joefso> Why I start my ubuntu and press ctrl + alt + F3 then I get all ugly fonts how do I fx this/
[10:22] <joefso> ?
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> dirle, ?
[10:22] <RingDonut> got paid 143 pounds
[10:22] <snype> ehh--- i dont know specifically which would work but there's HCL's online that'll help ui
[10:22] <jrib> !offtopic | RingDonut
[10:22] <ubotu> RingDonut: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[10:23] <edd_> right, im off to play America's Army :D
[10:23] <pantalaimon_> jrib, hmm but you have also use the >/dev/null right?
[10:23] <VMT2007> hm
[10:23] <Slart> joefso: ugly fonts? readable? distorted? or not beatiful enough?
[10:23] <edd_> cya
[10:23] <snype> anyone know how i switch between my internal and external displays on my laptop?
[10:23] <VMT2007> alright I finished installing ubuntu on my desktop
[10:23] <jrib> pantalaimon_: yes so it doesn't spit out the messages
[10:23] <apixelatedoffice> thanks, I'll be back if I still haven't found it.
[10:23] <VMT2007> are kernel sources included by default
[10:23] <dirle> I got to it .. and it is unverified one.. thought you knew something about it
[10:23] <kerik> snype: also on that same page?
[10:23] <joefso> slart it makes ncursed base programs all messy
[10:23] <gop> hey any here know
[10:23] <geokok> kitche: this (libglib2.0-0
[10:23] <geokok> The GLib library of C routines) is installed
[10:23] <kerik> snype: well...dont' you use F7 for that?
[10:23] <gop> how doI send a ctrl alt f7 via tight vnc or vnc
[10:23] <joefso> Slart, for example make menuconfig in kernel src dir, when I go down and up it messes the whole screen up
[10:23] <snype> kerik it's not supported natively
[10:23] <kitche> geokok: what version glib though?
[10:23] <jrib> pantalaimon_: I guess what was happening is it was waiting for standard in since you can use the keyboard to control it
[10:24] <pantalaimon_> jrib, oh yes you said that before i didnt see hehe
[10:24] <Slart> joefso: hmm.. hold on.. I'll try that
[10:24] <afm> if i have a copy of win2k3 x64 can i steal its codecs and make wmv play on my ubuntu x64 mythbox?
[10:24] <webmaren> i need help getting mplayer to play through my headphones
[10:24] <kerik> snype: I reckon you're right :)
[10:24] <blue-frog> VMT2007: look for linux-headers
[10:24] <cafuego_> afm: nope
[10:24] <vincent> Hi I'm looking for a workstation that can run mysql-server will ubuntu do? what's the default bootloader and default windows-manager?
[10:24] <joefso> Slart, i need to know how to change it?
[10:24] <VMT2007> as in compiling a custom kernel.
[10:24] <kerik> snype: that thinkwiki is a golden site :) thanks
[10:24] <geokok> kitche:2.12.4-0ubuntu1
[10:24] <afm> cafuego_ : why?
[10:25] <kitche> geokok: ok that's greater then 2.2 how about version of gtk+2
[10:25] <pantalaimon_> jrib, yeah... i must not allow background normally bacause of that
[10:25] <cafuego_> the short version? windows sucks.
[10:25] <afm> obviousle :)
[10:25] <kitche> VMT2007: you have to download the sources from the repo or from the kernel site
[10:25] <VMT2007> ah
[10:25] <webmaren> does anybody know how to get mplayer to play through usb headset
[10:26] <kerik> snype: is the wiki page all linux??
[10:26] <Slart> joefso: I haven't tried this on ubuntu.. but it works on debian.. look for svgatextmode .. it's a package that lets you customise fonts etc
[10:26] <geokok> kitche: not sure what package to look for . there are some libs but i wouldnt know which one is needed
[10:26] <nolimitsoya> webmaren, usb headsets are evil. they are little soundcards of their own, and never work
[10:26] <VMT2007> oh awesome i need to edit my grub.conf
[10:26] <snype> kerik uhhhh i think so. it's got a lot of linux support on it
[10:26] <kerik> snype: ohh...and one more question btw...do you know why my thinkpad doesn't shut up the speakers when I plug my headphones?
[10:27] <kerik> snype: that's just NICE
[10:27] <kenny> so can anyone help me out here, i read most of stuff in the documentation and nothing is working
=== masse is now known as masse|deferred
[10:27] <kitche> geokok: what version of ubuntu you on dapper or edgy you want libgtk2.0-0
[10:27] <geokok> kitche : edgy
[10:27] <Jeffm515> kerikL what kind of thinkpad?
[10:28] <VMT2007> where is grub.conf located
[10:28] <cafuego_> there is no such file
[10:28] <cafuego_> it's /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:28] <VMT2007> ah.
[10:28] <DualCortex_> Does anyone know how to make MAC address cloning permanent? Can I just add the command to rc.local???
[10:28] <geokok> kitche: its installed
[10:28] <webmaren> nolimitsoya: but it works for all my other sound
[10:28] <geokok> kitche:could i be needing the dev cersion?
[10:28] <cafuego_> DualCortex_: Probably add a post-up hook in /etc/network/interfaces
[10:29] <kitche> geokok: yes you need the dev if you have both installed then
[10:29] <LjL> DualCortex_: or perhaps you could add it to /etc/network/interfaces. the "up" command in there allows you to set an arbitrary command to be executed when a network interface is brought up
[10:29] <pantalaimon_> jrib, hey you can also use mplayer -noconsolecontrols filename >/dev/null & :P
[10:29] <dirle> TY all for your help.. and especialy nolimit.. hf gus
[10:29] <jrib> pantalaimon_: cool thanks, I saw in #mplayer :)
[10:30] <DualCortex_> cafuego: could you explain me how the command would look like if I did it in that file?
[10:30] <VMT2007> alright time for a massive update.
[10:30] <VMT2007> wow this distribution is amazing
[10:31] <justin420> it appears my agp is disabled on ubuntu edgy. any ideas on how to enable it? when i am in /proc/driver/nvidia/agp and do "cat status" it says the status is disabled.
[10:31] <VMT2007> apart from having to boot acpi=off...
[10:31] <VMT2007> meh
[10:31] <DualCortex_> cafuego: would it be the same as the command I would write in rc.local ;   "sudo ifconfig eth1 hw ether #####" then "sudo ifconfig  eth1 up"
[10:31] <phanter> hi there.
[10:31] <VMT2007> ifup eth1
[10:32] <VMT2007> that's a lot easier.
[10:32] <VMT2007> nevermind
[10:32] <VMT2007> a config file
[10:32] <Jeffm515> VMT2007: I had the same problem
[10:32] <DualCortex_> Ljl: could you explain me how the command would look like if I did it in that file?  would it be the same as the command I would write in rc.local ;   "sudo ifconfig eth1 hw ether #####" then "sudo ifconfig  eth1 up"
[10:32] <VMT2007> man
[10:32] <phanter> how can I get openoffice to recognise my digital signatures from firefox/thunderbird. I used google and tried what I found, but it does not work
[10:32] <LjL> DualCortex_: something like this  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36330/
[10:32] <VMT2007> if I ever start a computer shop
[10:32] <Jeffm515> VMT2007: celerion processor, compaq,
[10:33] <LjL> DualCortex_: hm, no, wait. if the command  you use to do that is ifconfig, then it can probably be done without "up"
[10:33] <VMT2007> I'll have a bunch of business-card CDs with ubuntu installers for people to take
[10:33] <cafuego_> DualCortex_: No, you wouldn't use sudo in either case (as those scripts run as root to begin with)
[10:33] <Jaak_> is xine Xine gnome based?
[10:33] <gnov> Hi all
[10:33] <gnov> I need a little help writing a bash script...
[10:33] <gnov> I have a file called file1
[10:33] <DualCortex_> cafuego: so just the command without the sudo would work?
[10:34] <kitche> Jaak_: xine is not gstreamer based think it can use the gstreamer engine though
[10:34] <gnov> I want have a script read it line by line and put it in an array.
[10:34] <gnov> How would I do that?
[10:34] <DualCortex_> Ljl: So just adding that line would do? Is it necessary to include the "sudo"?
[10:34] <jrib> Jaak_: totem-xine is, gxine uses gtk+, and there is also xine-ui
[10:34] <LjL> DualCortex_: like this, i think http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36331/ though i haven't tried it
[10:34] <cafuego_> DualCortex_: in the interfaces file you'd use "pre-up ifconfig eth1 hw ether #####"
[10:34] <LjL> DualCortex_: no, no sudo. and no ifconfig line, it makes no sense to use ifconfig *inside* /etc/network/interfaces
[10:34] <geokok> kitche: that did it. thanks
[10:34] <blue-frog> gnov: have a look in #bash
[10:35] <gnov> blue-frog: thanks
[10:35] <depi> can me somebody help with imagemagick? how is it possible to save the converted image in specified directory? for example: convert -size 478x700 */f.jpg -thumbnail '322x480<' f_thumb.jpg - I want to save the f_thumb.jpg in the same directory where is the f.jpg
[10:35] <LjL> cafuego: hm well, except what cafuego said :P check out my pastebin too, wouldn't that (or something similar) be ok too?
[10:35] <cafuego_> LjL: Hmm, it supports a 'hw' stanza by itself?
[10:35] <cafuego_> it does
[10:35] <LjL> cafuego_: "hwaddress", judging from "man interfaces"
[10:35] <phanter> anybody who has digital signatures working in openoffice and wants to help me to get it to work
[10:36] <cafuego_> DualCortex_: add a "hwaddress ether ##:##:##:##:##:##" entry to the interface
[10:36] <cafuego_> DualCortex_: that should be all you need to do
[10:36] <DualCortex_> cafuego: aright, thank you very much
[10:37] <DualCortex_> Ljl: thanks for the help!
[10:39] <cmweb> How do i go about limiting the badwith for computers on my lan

[10:43] <theBishop> has anyone been able to get Ubuntu on their Playstation3?
[10:43] <kerik> and/or someone who can teach a newb how to actually edit and save changes to files?

[10:44] <VMT2007> kerik: editor/
[10:44] <kerik> without using GUI that is
[10:44] <kerik> VMT2007: editor/filename?
[10:44] <VMT2007> kerik: what editor are you using, vi?
[10:44] <VividHazE> Hey could someone help me I'm just after installing EasyUbuntu and it worked but now every time i try to open Adept Package Manager in Kubuntu it says the database is locked because another process is using it, but I don't have any open!
[10:44] <VividHazE> >_<
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[10:44] <kerik> VMT2007: I believe vi is the one I have been using yeah..
[10:44] <LjL> kerik: "nano" is a user friendly text-mode editor. i use it normally
[10:45] <kerik> have also used nano....
[10:45] <VividHazE> I've tried logging out and full restart its still not working
[10:45] <LjL> kerik: so, the problem is? :P
[10:45] <theBishop> VMT2007, you know PS3 supports PPC distribtions of linux right?
[10:45] <kerik> but in either case I don't know how to save my changes
[10:45] <LjL> kerik: alt+x in nano

[10:45] <kerik> Ljl: great
[10:45] <ubun> man im glad i decided to install/learn ubuntu. i had win2k and didnt wanna buy a winxp license, let alone vista, but didnt want to be 'left behind' with an old operating system. ubuntu feels 'new' and can do everything i want and i can put it on all my machines for free =*)
[10:45] <tjb891> in ubuntu my copy of audacity does not allow me to record audio off the internet but i can off of amarok, i can record off a website with audacity in XP,does anyone know whats wrong?
[10:46] <kerik> LjL: that's a nice to know there :)
[10:46] <cmweb> wtf, i got a lexmark 6200 and its not even on the lexmark site
[10:46] <kerik> LjL: you shouldn't by any chance be a ibm user?
[10:46] <ubun> tjb probably some mp3 codec issue?
[10:46] <LjL> kerik: as in, user of an IBM manufactured PC? fortunately not :P
[10:46] <vincent> type esc->:->w->q in vi so esc :wq     w will write q will quit   esc :q to quit
[10:47] <tjb891> ubun:would having a AC97 codec instead of a soundcard do it?
[10:47] <ubun> dunno i havent used audacity, i just know it doesnt bundle mp3 codec with it
[10:47] <kerik> LjL: actually I have been fortunate enough with mine...it has found all drivers and all....only my middle mouse button I need working now...and thats where the problem is with the editor ;)
[10:48] <kerik> LjL: but I reckon there has happened a lot with linux since last time I tried to become a user...6 years ago it was absolutely impossible to find drivers :)
[10:48] <LjL> kerik: i believe if you run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" one of the option will be related to "3-button mouse emulation" (yes/no). try changing the setting that it gives you as a default
[10:48] <dylan_> I can burn /var/cache/apt/archives/ to cd, then do "dpkg -i /path/*" and install all of those packages on a comp. without net access, right?
[10:49] <kerik> LjL: I will try that :)
[10:49] <LjL> kerik: (of course you could also edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf directly, since that's what "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" does, but then the latter is made to help you with that)
[10:50] <dabaR> dylan_: You could try http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/
[10:50] <dylan_> dabaR, but could i do that, nevertheless?
[10:50] <VividHazE> Hey could anyone explain why my Adapt Package Manager would say the DBase is locked read only when I don't have anything else open accessing it?
[10:50] <VividHazE> This is so annoying.
[10:51] <dylan_> dabaR, in terms of dpkg -i to a path with everything burned?
[10:51] <quad3d> !ipod
[10:51] <ubotu> For information on how to sync and add tracks to your iPod, see the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto
[10:51] <dabaR> dylan_: well, given the fact that some of the packages have dependencies I doubt it would be as simple as you described, but sounds somewhat right.
[10:51] <kerik> LjL: but that wants me to reconfigure my entire system??
[10:51] <cmweb> Any one know how to share my printer on a network, or is that also a Samba thing?
[10:51] <dm_> i have just installed ubuntu.. i have 4 speaks but ubuntu is only playing sounds out of the 2 front ones.. i'm not sure what to do?

[10:51] <dabaR> VividHazE: you in fact have some process hogging it up. ps aux will list all the processes, then kill the one that is naughty
[10:51] <dylan_> dabaR, you mean to say that if i were to apt-get install (x) on one machine, then transfer everything in that machine's /var/cache/apt/archives directory to another machine and install all of that, i would not have the same packages installed?
[10:52] <VividHazE> aux in a terminal dabaR?
[10:52] <VividHazE> trying now
[10:52] <dabaR> VividHazE: ps aux
[10:52] <dabaR> dylan_: no, I am saying you will have to follow an order when installing the packages.
[10:52] <dm_> i have just installed ubuntu.. i have 4 speaks but ubuntu is only playing sounds out of the 2 front ones.. i'm not sure what to do?
[10:52] <vincent> VividHazE: ps ax | grep apt
[10:52] <vincent> kill it's pid
[10:53] <cmt^^> !tv-out

[10:53] <cmt^^> hmm
[10:53] <cmt^^> no help for radeon-cards? :<
[10:53] <VividHazE> vincent : its come up with 2 things, ok, so what do i type to kill those 2 processes?
[10:53] <VividHazE> I'm really new at this :(
[10:54] <cmt^^> dabaR - I have the drivers installed and everything
[10:54] <dylan_> dabaR, i can't just dpkg -i /path/* ?
[10:54] <vincent> VividHazE: enter the proces id the number in front  >kill nr#

[10:55] <dabaR> dylan_: I told you 3 times, no. Some packages only install if their dependencies are already installed, so you will have to install first the dependencies, then the packages you want.
[10:55] <Remo_A> hi all
[10:56] <Remo_A> I installed ubuntu and it didn't even ask for how to partition the system... that's not nice(edgy e)
[10:57] <Remo_A> for a windows machine in my network I think it'd be a good thing to partition one part as fat32
[10:57] <Remo_A> for sharing possibility
[10:57] <Fatal_sheep> depends what version of windows
[10:57] <VividHazE> vincent: I just killed those 2 processes and ran Adept Manager again but it iddn't open, nothing happened., so I ran it again and it comes up read-only again :)
[10:57] <VMT2007> DAMN I love ubuntu's package manager
[10:57] <dabaR> Remo_A: there are always options offered, you chose the one that does not ask for the specifics. The option you may like is called manually edit partition table.
[10:57] <J03> Bye All!
[10:57] <J03> !quit
[10:57] <J03> lol
[10:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about quit - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:57] <VMT2007> it's / not !
[10:58] <dabaR> VividHazE: run ps aux in a terminal, and post to paste.ubuntu-nl.org the output.
[10:58] <jamesbrose> haha
[10:58] <ernz> I NOW have the ability to send files to my SE k750i, but the phone asks me for a pin number for some weird reason, why is this, and what might it be, anyone?
[10:58] <Cosmonaut3030> Can anyone tell me how to turn off the beeping noises on my Thinkpad?
[10:59] <dabaR> Cosmonaut3030: does alsamixer in a terminal offer a beep control?
[10:59] <gop> my keyboard won't respond ubuntu
[10:59] <VividHazE> dabaR: ps aux output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36336/
[10:59] <jrib> Cosmonaut3030: system > preferences > sound > system beep  might help too
[10:59] <gop> it won't let me do alt f7
[10:59] <vincent> Cosmonaut3030: charge your battery ;-)
[11:00] <dabaR> VividHazE: I can not see the names of the apps. do ps ax
[11:01] <Cosmonaut3030> I've checked all the system settings, my battery is charged and it's coming from my laptop..
[11:01] <dsc> hail!    i tried to upgrade from dapper to edgy and it totally broke my installation =( it won't even boot now, gets hung loading file system..    i can still get to the old file system;  which directories besides /home should i copy -- meaning, what directories will i need in trying to recreate my installation on a new fresh installation?
[11:01] <bimberi> Cosmonaut3030: try 'xset -b'
[11:01] <justin420> it appears my agp is disabled on ubuntu edgy. any ideas on how to enable it? when i am in /proc/driver/nvidia/agp and do "cat status" it says the status is disabled. ive tried passing the kernel option acpi=off on the kernel im trying to boot and that didnt work
[11:01] <jevangelo> how do you get .avi and .mpeg support in ubuntu
[11:01] <Cosmonaut3030> dabaR: alsamixer has this stuff? and bimberi Ill try that too
[11:02] <jrib> ubotu: tell jevangelo about avi
[11:02] <finalbeta> How do I receive Teletext from my TV card?
[11:02] <cmweb> ok, my last q of the day, i have followed the install for the Lexmark X125 but i still cant get it to print, it says ready then it says printing then nothing prints
[11:02] <finalbeta> I'm using tvtime for playback
[11:02] <VividHazE> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36338/
[11:02] <gop> any here know how to restart mykeyboard
[11:02] <mwe> dsc: well maybe you can fix it instead, booting from a live-cd
[11:02] <gop> it won't start up
[11:02] <gop> or allow me to do alt f7
[11:02] <dabaR> VividHazE: kill -9 4749
[11:03] <Cosmonaut3030> bimberi: thanks, that covered it :d
[11:03] <mwe> dsc: how to you upgrade?
[11:03] <VividHazE> dabaR will try now
[11:03] <kerik> anyone can tell me how to save changes to a VI edited file?
[11:03] <mwe> kerik: :w
[11:03] <dabaR> kerik: true. ZZ or :wq
[11:03] <dsc> mwe, i have a stable installation on another partition, thats what im booted to right now.   I forget how i upgraded exactly, i ran a command line and the synaptic manager popped up with an option 'upgrade to 6.10' or something like that.  if you don't know what i'm talking about i can probably find the command on google
[11:03] <kerik> where to put that??
[11:04] <dsc> kerik: escape, then :w
[11:04] <dabaR> kerik: in command mode.
[11:04] <cmweb> Anyone have a X125 installed on their box?
[11:04] <mwe> kerik: :w will just save it. ZZ will save and quit as will :wq
[11:04] <VividHazE> dabaR it just says its loading for ages and nothing happens it just dissappears, thats when i try it again and it says its already open
[11:04] <VividHazE> but theres no window for it open
[11:04] <dave> so i have a quick favor to ask you guys
[11:04] <dave> you know the login display manager?  can someone find the console command to run it?
[11:04] <kerik> but I don't seem to be able to press ZZ or anyting else without adding that to the file?
[11:05] <dabaR> VividHazE: ya, that is a problem. It disappears from your screen, but the process stays alive. Not sure how to fix that.
[11:05] <mwe> dave: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[11:05] <bimberi> Cosmonaut3030: cool :)
[11:05] <dsc> mwe: i also tried installing edgy fresh on a different partition, and the same thing happens, i think my machine just doesnt like edgy..  so unless i can roll back i'm not sure there's anything that i can do
[11:05] <VividHazE> :S
[11:05] <dave> that sounds like it might be it.... thanks.  if its not, i'll be back in a bit
[11:05] <kerik> mwe: can you give me a little more detail? - I'm newb
[11:05] <VividHazE> Can't i make the window appear or something from the process
[11:05] <VividHazE> dabaR: I'm pretty sure it happened when I was installing EasyUbuntu software
[11:06] <dsc> i copied my databases, my websites, and my /home directory
[11:06] <mwe> kerik: about vi?
[11:06] <dabaR> kerik: go into your vi window, press escape, press :, press wq, press enter
[11:06] <ColonelZarkawi> dsc, edgy doesn't like lots of machines. If you want stability stay with dapper
[11:06] <cmweb> kingsqueak, still on
[11:06] <slicky> hm.. i deleted my lower panel.. and now when i click on a map / app stuff.. it dosent show up in the panel.. how do i get it back?
[11:06] <bimberi> kerik: hit <ESC> to get out of input mode. then try those commands
[11:06] <mwe> dsc: wel if a fresh install does it I don't know of my head ...
[11:06] <vincent> VividHazE: try  top  and see what apps uses on cpu if its working or dead exit top with control+c
[11:06] <dsc> ColonelZarkawi: i am going to stick with dapper, but i want to make sure i have all the files i need from my old installation before i wipe the partition and do it again
[11:06] <kerik> mwe: should I use the : sign? - cause I tried to press esc. and then the zz...I got out...now I will just see if I saved anything...
[11:07] <Genfoo> what program can I use to make a movie DVD copy?
[11:07] <mwe> kerik: ZZ not zz
[11:07] <cmweb> gah
[11:07] <mwe> kerik: capital Z
[11:07] <georgy> Genfoo: K9copy
[11:07] <kerik> yeah...I pressed shift + ZZ
[11:07] <Genfoo> ok
[11:07] <VividHazE> dabaR: Whats the name of the process i'm looking for?
[11:07] <Genfoo> thanks georgy
[11:07] <dave> it appears that wasn't it
[11:07] <dave> i'll be more specific
[11:07] <dsc> kerik:  w is for write, q is for quit, wq is write and quit , ..  :w  :q  :wq
[11:07] <slicky> anyone know how to do with the panels?
[11:07] <mwe> kerik: and what happened?
[11:07] <levander> What CD burning application will burn an already made ISO to disc?
[11:07] <kerik> mwe: but it didn't show...it just shut it down..
[11:07] <dave> so, i'
[11:07] <vincent> levander: k3b
[11:08] <Genfoo> georgy, k9copy is x kde app or CLI ?
[11:08] <dabaR> VividHazE: processes have ids, no names. the command has adept_manager in it.
[11:08] <mwe> kerik: it saved the file then, probably. what you describe sounds normal
[11:08] <georgy> levander : or graveman
[11:08] <levander> vincent: are there any I don't have to install all the KDE libs for?
[11:08] <semboy> !nvidia

When i restarted, and tried to login, I got the following message: "The greeter theme is corrupt.  The theme does not contain definitions for the username/password entry element"
[11:09] <kerik> mwe: do you know the program yelp?
[11:09] <VividHazE> dabaR: I'm going to restart again and see if it helps, thanks for your help anyway
[11:09] <mwe> kerik: by name
[11:09] <dave> and then it just shows a blank screen with a mouse cursor
[11:09] <cmweb> hello

[11:09] <georgy> levander : you are right, graveman don't do it, sorry
[11:10] <mwe> kerik: yelp is the gnome help browser
[11:10] <dabaR> dave: sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm may help
[11:10] <cafuego_> mc__: Then you read the notice on screen about WHY it refuses to work.
[11:10] <kerik> mwe: however thanks for your help on the vi :) it worked
[11:10] <cafuego_> mc__: It's ptrobably trying to prevent you from destroying something
[11:10] <kerik> success
[11:10] <levander> georgy: you remember the command to do it from the command line?
[11:10] <ubun> how can i make it so when i press 'alt' it actually opens a menu without me having to hold down the alt key?
[11:10] <dave> ok, i'll give that a shot.  any other ideas?

[11:10] <vincent> levander: bashburn
[11:10] <mwe> kerik: ok. use w! to save a read only file though. provided you have perms to do so. ZZ won't do that
[11:11] <kerik> mwe: ok well..don't remember opening the help though..
[11:11] <Jeffm515> lol; My room mate Just walked in.. looked at my desktop, said "wow"... took my install CD and walked away..
[11:11] <dsc> i mean, i know im going to have to reinstall a bunch of stuff but as for configuration, like say my firefox bookmarks..  i don't know for sure if all this stuff is in the /home or if it is scattered..   i got my apache config and a couple other things, as well as my /home directory,  i just want to make sure that once i wipe the partition i don't say, 'doh, i wish i'd saved THAT directory/file'
[11:11] <mwe> kerik: I use KDE.
[11:11] <dm_> if i'm trying to extract a .zip from gnome but the location is to a location where root needs to be the user extracting it.. how do i do it?

[11:11] <dsc> kerik: gedit also is nice.       :w!   means   (write - and override readonly)
[11:11] <mwe> kerik: :w!
[11:11] <ubun> Jeffm515:  what are you running for a desktop
[11:11] <cmweb> :'( surprised no one knows
[11:11] <mwe> kerik: the : puts you in command mode
[11:12] <starz> let me guess.. i need to reboot ~_~
[11:12] <mc__> cafuego_: it says
[11:12] <mc__>  Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should
[11:12] <mc__>  reinstall it before attempting a removal.
[11:12] <dm_> anyone?
[11:12] <Jeffm515> it's just the generic 6.10
[11:12] <semboy> yo i installd , ubuntu edgy , and now i want to move to ubuntu dapper
[11:12] <semboy> but how?
[11:12] <dsc> kerik if you are in typing mode though you have to hit esc key before you can type the : hehe
[11:12] <mwe> kerik: ZZ is a shorcut that works outside command mode

[11:12] <mwe> semboy: backup up and reinstall. why, though?
[11:13] <semboy> :S but how can i update my nvidia driver ? with edgy ??
[11:13] <mwe> kerik: it should be visible at the buttom of the window
[11:13] <Jeffm515> :w! = Write.. :wq! write Quit.
[11:13] <Jeffm515> er something
[11:13] <dsc> so, do you all think im good to go, with my /home and /etc/apache2 and my mysql datafiles ?
[11:13] <soundray> semboy: follow the wiki instructions for dapper. They apply to edgy, unless otherwise stated
[11:13] <kerik> mwe: ok...hmm...that might be it...I was in the top of the file when I wrote it...could that be why?

[11:13] <niko_m19> i installed ubuntu the newest version on my machine after runninng the live cd.  but i noticed when i installed it to the hard drive it had the same programs that were on the live cd
[11:13] <mwe> kerik: the ! is kinda like "shut up just do what I tell you to do!"
[11:14] <niko_m19> where is everything else
[11:14] <kerik> mwe: :) ok
[11:14] <Warbo> niko_m19: you have an Internet connection?
[11:14] <Jeffm515> did anyone else have issues intalling on a celeron processor?
[11:14] <Warbo> (on the Ubuntu machine)
[11:14] <kerik> mwe: I have a lot to learn I can see :)
[11:14] <niko_m19> yes
[11:15] <dabaR> kerik: vi has 2 modes, a command mode, and a edit mode. When you edit the text, you should press escape to go back to the command mode. In the command mode, when you press : it gives you a : in the bottom left, and then if you type w it will show up down there. After having w and q in the bottom left, if you press enter the vi editor will write and quit.
[11:15] <dm_> vincnet: how do i make cp copy all the directories as well, so i don't have to create them all manually?
[11:15] <Warbo> niko_m19: If so then Applications>Add/Remove will let you download new stuff
[11:15] <dm_> vincent: cp: omitting directory
[11:15] <mwe> kerik: you're bound to be annoyed with vi in the beginning
[11:15] <soundray> Jeffm515: is that a survey or are you looking for help?
[11:15] <niko_m19> i ended up deleted the partitions though and wiping my mbr though
[11:15] <georgy> levander: cdrecord speed=X dev=Y,Z,W -v -eject -data backup.iso and cdrecord -scanbus to find Y,Z,W

[11:15] <kerik> dabaR: ok so the : first and then the letters?
[11:16] <mwe> kerik: vi is great but it takes a while to get used to it and learn to use it right
[11:16] <Genfoo> is there anything besides k9copy I can use to copy movie DVDs?
[11:16] <soundray> Jeffm515: I have a Celeron machine that runs fine
[11:16] <dm_> how do i copy files using 'cp' so it copies and creates directories for me
[11:16] <christiane__> Hello. I connect to a WPA2 AP with a bcm43xx driven wifi card. I'm 2 ft. away but only get speed of abobut 120 kbit/s. Switching to another OS gives me up to 35 Mbit/s. What's wrong here?
[11:16] <kerik> mwe: yeah seems that way :)
[11:16] <Genfoo> k9copy says I don't have dvdauthor .... but I do so its broken
[11:16] <Jeffm515> soundray: did you have to turn off acpi?
[11:16] <dabaR> kerik: when in command mode, meaning if you press : a little : appears in the bottom left, and not as part of your typing.
[11:16] <Warbo> dm_: "cp -r <foldername> <destination>"
[11:16] <ubun> how can i make it so when i press 'alt' to open a menu, i dont have to hold the key down. (so it works like it does in windows)
[11:16] <macks_> ubuntu doesn't seem to recognize my broadcom 4306 pci card. Can someone help me get this working?\
[11:16] <soundray> dm_: 'cp -a' -- check out 'man cp'
[11:16] <dm_> thanks
[11:16] <soundray> Jeffm515: what has that to do with it being a Celeron?
[11:16] <georgy> Genfoo : are you compile K9copy ?
[11:17] <mwe> kerik: everyone gets annoyed by vi in the beginning
[11:17] <Genfoo> georgy, I apt-get
[11:17] <Jeffm515> soundray: it's the only thing both machines had in common..
[11:17] <PoorNoob> Any good soul would like to help poor brazillian guys trying to set up their ubuntu box as router with dhcp, nat and adsl modem configuration from the very beginning? We offer hot chicks and amazon's weed!!  nice pot huh... trust us :P

[11:19] <kwood> M having a problem on a install of 6.10 desktop... my resolution is forced at 640x480 and I can not see hte install prompts at all... is there a way to force a higher resolution while running from the cd?
[11:19] <macks_> ubuntu doesn't seem to recognize my broadcom 4306 pci card. Can someone help me get this working?\
[11:19] <Genfoo> try:
[11:19] <Warbo> kerik: Yes. Usually ctrl-alt-backspace will do it
[11:19] <mwe> kerik: yeah
[11:19] <Genfoo> 1234
[11:19] <Genfoo> or password
[11:19] <Genfoo> :-P
[11:19] <kerik> mwe: YES! - I got to figure something out by myself :D ;)
[11:20] <pantalaimon_> soundray, isnt there something like a variable in the alias that is initializated when we are going to execute the command?
[11:20] <Warbo> ernz: I had that problem. I think I solved it b editing a file in /etc somewhere. Hang on, I'll have  look
[11:20] <mwe> kerik: well if you need to reload the configuration I think you need to restart the login manager as well. sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[11:20] <kerik> Warbo: thanks man - does that close my apps and so on?
[11:20] <ernz> Warbo: I would be EXTREMELY grateful.
[11:20] <mwe> kerik: that will shut down your session promply though
[11:20] <mwe> kerik: then put you back to the login screen
[11:20] <kerik> mwe: can you tell me what that gdm is?
[11:20] <dsc> thanks again Warbo!
[11:21] <mwe> kerik: the default login manager
[11:21] <Warbo> ernz: Looks like /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf (open it with a text editor as superuser)
[11:21] <kerik> mwe: I haven't really learned the dirs yet, so I am rather curious...
[11:21] <Genfoo> kerik, gdm owns all x sessions of yours
[11:21] <Genfoo> the "ghetto" version is xdm
[11:21] <soundray> pantalaimon_: not in the alias that comes builtin in bash (at least not to my knowledge)
[11:21] <ernz> Warbo, any idea what I change in here? Perhaps you could pastebin yours :) ?
[11:21] <PoorNoob> Any good soul would like to help poor brazillian guys trying to set up their ubuntu box as router with dhcp, nat and adsl modem configuration from the very beginning? We offer hot chicks and amazon's weed!!  nice pot huh... trust us :P
[11:21] <Genfoo> kerik, gdm also happens to start gnome for you :)
[11:21] <PoorNoob> come on
[11:22] <PoorNoob> let's make an exchange :)
[11:22] <kerik> mwe: what is the init.d? I have seen that before but never known what it does?

[11:22] <soundray> PoorNoob: if you're not getting a response, try rephrasing your question. Your humour doesn't seem to go down well.
[11:22] <Warbo> ernz: Looking through that there is "# Default PIN code for incoming connections | passkey "1234";"
[11:22] <Amaranth> somerville32: ?
[11:22] <mwe> kerik: it's a directory containing the boot scripts
[11:22] <soundray> PoorNoob: what usually works better is a description of your actual problem.
[11:23] <PoorNoob> we are trying to figure out a squid proxy

[11:23] <PoorNoob> we have an adsl modem

[11:23] <cmweb> Does any one know how to install a Lexmark 125
[11:23] <kerik> ok
[11:23] <mwe> kerik: you can invoke them after bootup to stop a service or start/restart one
[11:23] <palomer> hello
[11:23] <_Dante_> I have a cell phone with USB, and I want to get pictures off it.  When I plug it in, nothing happens (except once my machine locked up).  Its a samsung sgh-d807
[11:23] <somerville32> Amanth: See #ubuntu-ops
[11:23] <palomer> how do I get fontcofig to recognize other fonts?
[11:23] <semboy> You must have restricted modules enabled , how can i do it :( , i just installd ubuntu edgy  , :P i am noob
[11:23] <kerik> mwe: so actually as the msconfig in Windows?
[11:23] <palomer> I'm trying to get ttf-freefont to work with fontconfig, but I don't know where to start!!!
[11:23] <soundray> !font | palomer
[11:23] <ubotu> palomer: Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "msttcorefonts" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". No fonts in MPlayer? see !MPlayer

[11:24] <mwe> kerik: /etc/init.d/gdm is a script that controls gdm, the login manager. invoking it with the argument "restart" will, well, restart gdm ;)
[11:24] <PoorNoob> so we were reading that we have to make the modem as a bridge
[11:24] <kerik> semboy: sudo in front of your command
[11:24] <PoorNoob> we've tried to do that. but when we make this happen, then we don't grant access to the web
[11:24] <PoorNoob> :(
[11:24] <palomer> soundray, that doesn't tell me how to add fonts to fontconfig!
[11:24] <_Dante_> !usb
[11:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about usb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:24] <semboy> kerik i am trying to install my nvidia driver ?
[11:25] <haary> jafar: what does ls -l /dev/dsp say?
[11:25] <feugan3333> Hi all. Does anyone know how to disable the alt-right mouse button menu?
[11:25] <kerik> mwe: ok :) actually it is very logically...I am just not used to it...
[11:25] <Warbo> Is it possible to turn plugins on and of in Epiphany? (I think there used to be a menu option for it, but I can't fin it in the latest version). I really want to get rid of this totem plugin, but uninstalling it will get rid of ubuntu-desktop
[11:25] <ernz> Warbo that still isn't working :(    I am having no problems sending TO the computer, just FROM. This is really starting to bug me I have been trying for 4 hours solid now to get this to work.
[11:25] <mwe> kerik: not quite like msconfig. /etc/init.d/ is just an important directory containing scripts
[11:25] <soundray> palomer: sorry, I responded more to the 'I don't know where to start' part of the question instead of the specific part.
[11:25] <_Dante_> semboy: look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[11:25] <semboy> kerik  how can i enable this :( "restricted modules"
[11:25] <PoorNoob> so, the thing is.. do we have to have a dhcp server or not?
[11:26] <^[D] emone^666> sera a tutti
[11:26] <kerik> semboy...I am not too sure about the nvidia I must admit..
[11:26] <_Dante_> is there a way for me to probe USB devices or such?
[11:26] <soundray> Warbo: just get rid of ubuntu-desktop. It is merely a metapackage that you don't need in day-to-day running.
[11:26] <Warbo> ernz: Ah, I haven't done that in a while, and I'm on my laptop at the moment which I haven't set up for Bluetooth yet. What I do know is that Konqueror is the easiest program to use after setting it up
[11:26] <_Dante_> semboy: I have a nvidea -- whats up?
[11:26] <ortega10> hello, is there any open source alternative to ext2ifs, for accesing ext2/3 partitions from windows?
[11:26] <kerik> mwe: but can it be used to change which apps/scripts running at startup?
[11:26] <semboy> _Dante_ i am new to linux and trying to install nvidia driver
[11:26] <soundray> _Dante_: check if your device is seen with 'lsusb' in a terminal
[11:26] <_Dante_> semboy: look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[11:27] <ernz> Warbo: Perhaps I should switch to Kubuntu?
[11:27] <_Dante_> soundray: thanks
[11:27] <semboy> _Dante_ thanks , i will check
[11:27] <ortega10> soundray, Warbo: ubuntu-desktop is neened when upgrading, be careful
[11:27] <tonyyarusso> I'm looking for some help setting up vhosts in Apache, to create a virtual subdomain (same machine & IP) for a particular directory.
[11:27] <_Dante_> soundray: nothing comes up -- lsusb just waits there
[11:27] <mwe> kerik: that's controlled with links in /etc/rc?.d/. using the program 'bum' is probably the easiest way of controling it
[11:27] <Warbo> ortega10: Yeah, that's what I was thinking
[11:27] <soundray> _Dante_: sometimes it helps to run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' while you plug the device
[11:27] <Warbo> oh well, gone now
[11:27] <mwe> kerik: bum is an easy to use bootup manager
[11:28] <kerik> mwe: can that be installed from apt-get?
[11:28] <soundray> Warbo: reinstalling it before the next upgrade will be fully sufficient.
[11:28] <Warbo> ernz: Konqueror runs fine in Ubuntu, but it may install quite a bit of stuff to get it running
[11:28] <mwe> kerik: right. sudo apt-get install bum
[11:28] <kerik> mwe: sounds like a nice solution...
[11:28] <kerik> mwe: how will I later on execute it?
[11:28] <soundray> _Dante_: that usually means that your USB hardware is locked up. I haven't found a way around this yet apart from a cold reboot.
[11:28] <kerik> mwe: or start it even
[11:28] <ortega10> hello, is there any open source alternative to ext2ifs, for accesing ext2/3 partitions from windows ?
[11:29] <_Dante_> soundray, one sec -- I'll see if it can see my ipod
[11:29] <Genfoo> yes
[11:29] <LjL> ortega10: yes. google "ext2 windows"
[11:29] <mwe> kerik: open a terminal and type 'gksudo bum'
[11:29] <kerik> warbo: the program crashes or the changes make everything crash? ;)
[11:29] <Clarrisa> How can I give myself root access in Samba?
[11:29] <soundray> ortega10: yes, there are a number. I found some on the wikipedia page on ext2
[11:29] <Genfoo> ortega10, there are some out there :-)
[11:29] <Genfoo> that embed in explorer
[11:29] <feugan3333> ortega10: explore2fs?
[11:29] <mc__> how to remove a package when  even dpkg --force-all --purge refuses to work?
[11:29] <mwe> kerik: or find it in the menu if the installer creates a shorcut ( I think it does)
[11:29] <Genfoo> i used to have it, but then I incinerated my windows
[11:29] <ernz> Warbo: 50MB of "Extra stuff" to be precise :)
[11:29] <Chirantha> dear god!
[11:29] <Warbo> kerik: For me the program just locks up. But I haven't used it in a wile, maybe it's been fixed (or my computer is rubbish :) )
[11:30] <Chirantha> OMFG!
[11:30] <Chirantha> OMFG! OMFG!!
[11:30] <kerik> mwe: what does the gksudo do?
[11:30] <mwe> mc__: it's not proberly installed?
[11:30] <feugan3333> Does anyone know how to disable the alt-right mouse button menu?

[11:30] <ubotu> Chirantha: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[11:30] <ortega10> feugan3333: thanks but explore2fs is not a suitable replacement; it's some kind of file manager instead of a transparent driver
[11:30] <Warbo> ernz: If you install it with Apttude then removing it with Aptitude later will also remove that stuff
[11:30] <_Dante_> soundray, hmmmm--- I'm going to reboot...bbs

[11:31] <LjL> Chirantha: sometimes... especially when it's used for things that are irrelevant to Ubuntu support ;-)
[11:31] <ernz> Warbo: I plan on figuring out how to install everything and make it work, then start from scratch with a fresh edgy install and then add everything by textbook. Cleaner that way. The only thing I haven't figured is DAMNED BERYL!!!!!!

[11:31] <kerik> mwe: nice to know....
[11:31] <tonyyarusso> ortega10: Ah, never mind me then.  (I just hit the bot...)
[11:31] <mc__> mwe: nope it is not correctly installed,it fails configuring
[11:31] <kerik> mwe: so gksudo when GUI and sudo when text?

[11:32] <mwe> mc__: then only way I know of fixing that if you can't properly install it is manually removing it from the status file.
[11:32] <kerik> mwe: oohh..that bum is a spacey bastard...uses all 650 kb ;)
[11:33] <ernz> Warbo: I got it working after hours of screwing around, then I changed my X server to 2048x1024 and it stopped working.

[11:34] <mwe> mc__: well first read this "Do it on your own risk!"
[11:34] <Fatal_sheep> gonna ask a question - how come my login screens sayin edubuntu instead of just ubuntu ?
[11:34] <ubun> why does system monitor say most of my currently running apps are 'sleeping'?
[11:34] <ernz> Ubuntu...It just works...Sometimes.
[11:34] <mwe> mc__: usually it's safe if you backup first though
[11:34] <mc__> mwe: alright
[11:34] <Fatal_sheep> installed ubuntu  not changed my session screen
[11:34] <soundray> Warbo: can't you grep in /etc for some string that might be in the changed file?
[11:34] <GNU\colossus> ubun: because you haven't got a logical CPU for each of the running tasks, have you? ;)
[11:34] <Warbo> Fatal_sheep: Did you install any edubuntu-desktop packages or something? You can change it with System>Administration>Loin Window

[11:35] <soundray> ernz: that's too much at once. I suggest you do a soft phase-in of Linux instead of a hard switch away from Windows.
[11:35] <guillem101> Fatal_sheep, you installed edubuntu metapacakge
[11:35] <ernz> SoundRay: Also, since I installed Edgy, it has been crashing more and I have an imaginary Floppy drive also!?
[11:35] <kerik> mwe: naiz...I have learned how to use another command :)
[11:35] <Fatal_sheep> i install all updates

[11:37] <soundray> ortega10: I found that working really well so far.
[11:37] <ubun> vlc can too
[11:37] <ortega10> maybe ubotu should recommend this one instead of the closed-source other... who should i ask?
[11:37] <Warbo> Fatal_sheep: Search for "usplash" in Synaptic (System>Admin>Synaptic) to change bootup screen

[11:38] <jcore> how can you make your desktop spin like a 3D box?
[11:38] <mwe> mc__: ok. sudo nano status. then you'll see that each package has a section of about 20 lines and each section is seperated by a blank line. locate the section for you package and remove that section and save the file
[11:38] <jcore> is that something you have to download?

[11:40] <kchung> how can i disable a device on my system?
[11:40] <_Dante_> ok -- I'll try a board mounted socket
[11:40] <ernz> Warbo: It looks nice. IF ONLY I could get this blasted pass key thing sorted. It's starting to really **** me off now.
[11:41] <soundray> kchung: via the BIOS setup, or by blacklisting the driver module
[11:41] <Fatal_sheep> ahhh ive got myself into a right mess now
[11:41] <soundray> !blacklist | kchung
[11:41] <ubotu> kchung: To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add "blacklist modulename" to the end of that list
[11:41] <php-freak> any one know why my sound card is not working on a 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97
[11:41] <Fatal_sheep> ok all i want it to say is ubuntu
[11:41] <kchung> soundray: bios has no option. thanks for hte info!
[11:41] <kchung> soundray: how do i list what modules i got loaded?
[11:42] <pythonic> hi! is there something like http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages for ubuntu? i need to download .deb packages to install (i can't use apt-get) on dapper drake.
[11:42] <soundray> kchung: with lsmod (in a terminal
[11:42] <soundray> )
[11:42] <kchung> thanks
[11:42] <Fatal_sheep> isnt there a way you can take the flash screen back to default?
[11:42] <_Dante_> soundray, ok -- its plugged into the board -- lsusb shows the phone "Bus 001 Device 003: ID 04e8:663f Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd"
[11:42] <mwe> mc__: doing what I suggested, you'll have to manually remove any files the package might have installed, though.
[11:42] <bimberi> pythonic: http://packages.ubuntu.com
[11:42] <christiane__> Does anyone know an irc channel where I could ask about my slow wifi connection?

[11:42] <jcore> Is there way to upgrade from 5.05 to 5.10?
[11:42] <jamesbrose> How can i "purge" or get rid of this broken package that wont go away
[11:42] <_Dante_> soundray, but I can't see it as a hdd
[11:43] <soundray> pythonic: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
[11:43] <tonyyarusso> !upgrade | jcore
[11:43] <ubotu> jcore: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:43] <jcore> thanks
[11:43] <mc__> jamesbrose: sudo dpkg --purge package
[11:44] <madman91> hello all
[11:44] <mwe> mc__: doing what I suggested, you'll have to manually remove any files the package might have installed, though.
[11:44] <Fatal_sheep> spalsh screens ? i dont want to custom it i want my ubuntu one back
[11:44] <Fatal_sheep> splash
[11:44] <jcore> what does LTS stand for in "6.06 LTS"
[11:44] <jrib> !lts | jcore
[11:44] <ubotu> jcore: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[11:44] <pythonic> bimberi: soundray: thanks :-)
[11:44] <soundray> _Dante_: that means it doesn't work as a mass storage device. There may be a config option on the phone.
[11:44] <_Dante_> hmmm
[11:44] <mc__> mwe: i dont care if there remein somed files
[11:44] <soundray> _Dante_: but it's quite possible that Samsung doesn't support using your phone with Linux.
[11:45] <mwe> mc__: ok ;)
[11:45] <cmweb> am i in?
[11:45] <cmweb> stupid dialup
[11:45] <_Dante_> soundray, the guy at the store INSISTED that it would mount as mass storage
[11:45] <soundray> _Dante_: in which case you have to rely on third-party drivers that obviously haven't made their way into Ubuntu yet, if they exist at all.
[11:45] <soundray> _Dante_: excellent, get him to fix it then ;)
[11:45] <madman91> i have a nokia n73 phone .... when i connect it with a usb cable to my ubuntu box a few option show up on the phone.. i choose 'mass storage' .. it shows up as a folder on my ubuntu desktop.. after i finish the file exchange i 'eject' the folder (and the phone) ... BUT the phone connection does not shut down... its not mounted in 'mount' .. and no data is being transfered... but the phone still shows a connection.. in windows
[11:45] <madman91> however... when i eject it .. the phone sees the termination of transfer,,,, any ideas?
[11:46] <Clarrisa> can anyone here help me with Samba?  I can create a network share from a windows box by logging in as root, but I still don't see the root of my linux box
[11:46] <_Dante_> soundray, right
[11:46] <php-freak> any one know why my sound card is not working on a 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97
[11:46] <Fatal_sheep> anybody ?
[11:46] <Fatal_sheep> boot screen problems
[11:46] <soundray> _Dante_: I hate to give this advice, but the next step is to search the web. Sometimes it helps to use the device ID as shown by lsusb
[11:47] <soundray> _Dante_: as a search string
[11:47] <_Dante_> soundray, I'm getting wierd stuff outputted to my terminal "kernel: [17179988.884000]  Oops: 0002 [#1] "
[11:47] <snype> i just did the dumbest thing haha, my mouse stopped working so i start messing with xorg.conf and then start messing w/ my bios and then some other files and then finally i realize.... it's battereis were dead!
[11:47] <jcore> Is kubuntu the "better version" of ubuntu? Or are there any significant differences between gnome and KDE?
[11:47] <cmweb> can some one ssh into my box and tell me how slow it is
[11:47] <bimberi> !usplash | Fatal_sheep
[11:47] <ubotu> Fatal_sheep: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[11:47] <Fatal_sheep> kbuntu is kde
[11:48] <jcore> what does kde offer that gnome doesnt?
[11:48] <snype> ubuntu is gnome
[11:48] <conner> ubuntu is so good I don't need any help! :P
[11:48] <soundray> cmweb: you must be crazy
[11:48] <Lynoure> cmweb: very bad idea.
[11:48] <snype> kubuntu vs. ubuntu is mainly preference
[11:48] <Warbo> jcore: It is a matter of prefernce. Personally I use KDE's desktop-drawing program in Enlightenment in GNOME :)
[11:48] <snype> i dont think anyone has the audacity to say one is better or not
[11:48] <snype> but xfce, xubuntu, is def. the best :-D
[11:49] <jamesbrose> I'm getting this error when trying to remove a package ( http://pastebin.ca/274733 ) please help!!
[11:49] <cmweb> bad idea, maby but if i want to do this from work, i wna know what to expect
[11:49] <soundray> madman91: I would run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and check for any error messages while you eject.
[11:49] <Fatal_sheep> the thing is i dont want to install my own artwork i just want the ubuntu one back instead of edubuntu
[11:49] <Lynoure> cmweb: if you let a random person into your system, you kinda know what to expect :(
[11:49] <madman91> soundray: sounds good.. lemme try .. ....
[11:49] <guido__> hola
[11:49] <jcore> Is "sudo" an ubuntu only command? I dont remember seeing that on other distros of linux
[11:49] <soundray> _Dante_: that sounds worrying
[11:50] <soundray> jcore: no, it isn't
[11:50] <Fatal_sheep> sudo - debian based
[11:50] <cmweb> true, they cant get in any way theyl hit a firewall
[11:50] <_Dante_> soundray, meh...I'll use my work computer to get my photos off my phone
[11:50] <madman91> jcore: ive seen it in fedora and mandriva
[11:50] <soundray> _Dante_: I think your phone is not properly USB compatible. Sometimes you find that Windows is more tolerant than Linux towards such glitches.
=== guido__ is now known as zaratustra
[11:50] <mc44> Fatal_sheep: sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
[11:51] <semboy> i got problem when i am trying to follow the steps ,  i just dont find this "Restricted copyright box" but there is something called "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (Multiverse)" can it be this ?  , and yeah i am on ubuntu edgy  . so i am askin how to do this please help me
[11:51] <soundray> _Dante_: still, you shouldn't get an Oops just from connecting a USB device.
[11:51] <_Dante_> soundray, why samsung would do that -- I have no idea
[11:51] <Warbo> jcore: Many other distros enable the "root" acount, and let users log into that using "su". Ubuntu disables it and gives normal (admin) users root's permissions with sudo
[11:51] <semboy> _dante_ i thought you where gonna help me xD
[11:51] <_Dante_> soundray, my system is super stable otherwise -- I'm sure its the phone
[11:51] <bimberi> Fatal_sheep: that page includes the command 'sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so'.  Perhaps the ubuntu splash will be presented as an alternative.  There are also a few other steps to do (on that page) if that works.
[11:51] <_Dante_> semboy: sorry whats up?
[11:52] <semboy> _Dante_ pssss :S i just dont find this "Restricted copyright box2" but there is something called "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (Multiverse)" can it be this ?
[11:52] <madman91> soundray: wow .. it worked this time :D ... well i just updated my phoen f/w .. so maybe that was it
[11:52] <madman91> soundray: thanks for the help
[11:52] <Fatal_sheep> ok chers will try
[11:52] <_Dante_> semboy, yup
[11:52] <_Dante_> semboy, check that
[11:52] <ernz> Warbo: IT WORKS!!!!! It just needed a restart! How Awesome is that!??????
[11:52] <semboy> _Dante_ k
[11:52] <soundray> _Dante_: Samsung have been known to do weird stuff. They used to have nice USB mass storage compatible MP3 players, but replaced the whole range with some that only work with Windows XP (not even with Mac OS!)
[11:53] <jcore> im trying to get XGL installed but "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl" isnt working
[11:53] <cmweb> Lynoure, wait a minute, you actuly thought i was going to let them in? I only wanted to see how long it took to conenct
[11:53] <soundray> madman91: good tip
[11:53] <_Dante_> soundray, I love it -- we'll differentiate ourselves from the ipod by being less useful
=== Oleg is now known as Alik
[11:53] <soundray> _Dante_: did you see this? madman91 fixed his phone probs by updating phone firmware
[11:53] <_Dante_> soundray, hmmm
[11:54] <madman91> lol
[11:54] <soundray> _Dante_: don't get me started on manufacturers. I'll be ranting all night. (sry offtopic)

[11:54] <Rasta> sup tup
[11:55] <bimberi> all-knowing? pfft
[11:55] <nolimitsoya> how does the bot work; can anyone add and link, or is that reserved for mods?
[11:55] <Clarrisa> can anyone here help me with Samba?  I can create a network share from a windows box by logging in as root, but I still don't see the root of my linux box
=== con-man_ is now known as con-man
[11:55] <snype> well now i feel even stupider/happier, i thought i had 768mb ram in my laptop, just found out i have a gb!
[11:55] <nolimitsoya> !
[11:55] <Rasta> there are other window managers that are more lightweight for work? gnome seems too bloated for my pc
[11:55] <nolimitsoya> Clarrisa, you want ssh
[11:55] <_Dante_> semboy, did that work?
[11:55] <soundray> bimberi: it's just a way of saying "that's all I know" ;)
[11:55] <jrib> nolimitsoya: anyone can add, but it gets sent for approval
[11:56] <mwe> Raskall: fluxbox is my favorite lw wm
[11:56] <Warbo> Rasta: Xubuntu (XFCE), Fluxbox, E16 are my favourites (in reverse order)
[11:56] <nolimitsoya> Rasta, try out xfce. i love it :)
[11:56] <mc44> nolimitsoya: read the second link from !help for details on adding stuff
[11:56] <bimberi> nolimitsoya: there is an editor list, you could ask for access in #ubuntu-ops
[11:56] <nolimitsoya> jrib, how does one do that?
[11:56] <nolimitsoya> ok, thank you :)
[11:56] <Rasta> ok, ill get it , thanks
[11:56] <jrib> ubotu: tell nolimitsoya about yourself
[11:56] <bimberi> soundray: ha! :)
[11:56] <_trine> hey guys Ive just tried vista its a real linux chalenge
[11:56] <mwe> Rasta: you might like fluxbox as well
[11:56] <Clarrisa> nolimitsoya, I have ssh.  but how does that help me?  I use putty to login to the box and can run bash, but I was hoping for a GUI from my windows box so that copying to multiple virtual directories in apache's www folders would be easier
[11:56] <soundray> _trine: and do you have any ubuntu support questions as well?
[11:56] <Rasta> nolimitsoya, you are armando?
[11:57] <nolimitsoya> _trine, nothing with even rudimental palladuim support can ever be a challenge for linux
[11:57] <soundray> Clarrisa: try vnc
[11:57] <justin420> hi all. anybody tell me when i do " cat /proc/driver/nvidia/agp/status " it says status: disabled agp initialization failed?
[11:57] <nolimitsoya> Rasta, nope. /whois ;)
[11:57] <Rasta> ok, sorry ;)
[11:57] <Clarrisa> soundray, the problem with this is that my linux box does not have a GUI installed on it.   It's set up as a LAMP server
[11:57] <soundray> Clarrisa: configure Ubuntu via 'System-Preferences-Remote Desktop' and use vncviewer from Windows to... oh
[11:58] <Clarrisa> is it not possible to do this with samba?
[11:58] <soundray> Clarrisa: samba has a web config thing called swat
[11:58] <jcore> Can someone tell me where to download the xserver-xgl package?
[11:58] <tonyyarusso> !swat
[11:58] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[11:58] <jcore> the command sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl is not working
[11:58] <soundray> Clarrisa: you won't be able to work on your Apache config with it, though
[11:58] <semboy> _Dante_ nope :(
[11:59] <tonyyarusso> jcore: #ubuntu-xgl perhaps?
[11:59] <_Dante_> semboy, what happened?
[11:59] <jcore> thanks
[11:59] <_Dante_> semboy, did you restart X?
[11:59] <semboy> _Dante_ no
[11:59] <Clarrisa> soundray, why not?  ...
[11:59] <semboy> should i?
[11:59] <semboy> _dante_ should i?
[11:59] <snype> jcore you can find it on beryl repositories
[11:59] <soundray> Clarrisa: because it's a config tool for Samba, not Apache
[11:59] <_Dante_> semboy, Cntrl-Alt-Backspace.  see if you get the nvidea logo (you will loose all your open apps, so save everything you want)
[11:59] <snype> but i should warn you xserver-xgl sucks!
[12:00] <adaptr> snype: nonsense - it's running just fine
[12:00] <semboy> _Dante_ hold down , cause i am not finding the linux-restricted-modules packges
[12:00] <adaptr> snype: I'm whirling my cube as we speak
[12:00] <Clarrisa> soundray, isn't there a way to just give me root access from samba?  I know it's probably considered dangerous, but I would think people do it for lots of copying to various folders
[12:00] <semboy> _Dante_  are you on egdy
[12:01] <_Dante_> semboy, yes
