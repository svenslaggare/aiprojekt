[12:03] <sorush21> how do I configure kernel?
[12:03] <stefg> burwaco: 'server' in ubuntu-speak == 'base system'... the next thing up to the foodchain over fluxbx  would be xfce then, indeed. but you have to manually select all the xfce packages, xubuntu-desktop will install alot of other cruft
[12:03] <alecjw> battlesquid: i've gotta go now. if you find a deb, install it using gdebi or sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb. if you find an rpm, do sudo alien -d <filename>.rpm then sudo dpkg -i outputfile>.deb

[12:06] <lllloo> hi folks
[12:07] <lllloo> i have a ide hardrive were ubuntu resides
[12:07] <lllloo> and my  windows installation happens to be on a raid partition  ,, STRIPPED type
[12:07] <billias> Hello people!
[12:07] <lllloo> when booting the log errors says theres I/O buffer error  i guess when trying to mount it its ntfs too
[12:08] <lllloo> any suggestions
[12:08] <lumpki> !generic
[12:09] <ubotu> Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[12:09] <H3g3m0n> lllloo: Try cfdisk the drive and see if it has the partitions you expect, also file -s /dev/drive
[12:09] <billias> I have a problem with my DVD-RAM on my laptop, I am using Ubuntu Edgy (6.10). There is no way I can mount it
[12:10] <lllloo> it says cannot open disk drive
[12:10] <burwaco> stefg: so I: apt-get install x-window-system xfce4 ?
[12:10] <lllloo> its like it hasnt even mounted it at all

[12:11] <burwaco> huh?
[12:12] <burwaco> that can't be right...
[12:12] <lumpki> eilker, just type /tmp in the address bar
[12:13] <stefg> burwaco: as i said there's no simple installation of one or two packages... you've got to manually go through the package list in aptitude and select your wanted packages. all those meta-packages probably install stuff that you don't want
[12:13] <atoponce> how do i enter unicode into gnome-terminal?
[12:13] <eilker> lumpki: thank you, but what is its path ?
[12:14] <burwaco> stefg: isn't there a package like the gnome-base-system
[12:15] <atoponce> i can view utf-8, just can't enter the characters.  and it's driving me nuts. anyone know?
[12:15] <LinuxHelp> I've been looking at the packages in feisty, and I've found "kqemu-source", now the package description says "This package provides the source code for the kqemu kernel modules." BUT then it also says "it is a closed source proprietary product". So am I right in assuming that this is now an "open source" program, but it is just not "free software"?
[12:15] <patrick_king> how do i play midi files
[12:16] <stefg> xfce4 is such a meta-package... but there might even be stuff as a dependency (like the xfce4 print-manager) that you don't want...
[12:16] <LinuxHelp> Either way, the package description is confusing.
[12:16] <eilker> lumpki: i cant send pm, some registiration problem, thanx for info

[12:28] <jughead> hello, I have a question or two before i install ubuntu about partitions
[12:29] <systemrestore> ask jughead
[12:29] <jughead> I have a 100 gig hdd on my laptop that has windows on it.  does the ubuntu partitioner include a way to split the partition to make room for ubuntu?
[12:29] <tonyyarusso> jughead: yes
[12:29] <systemrestore> yes
[12:29] <tonyyarusso> !dualboot | jughead
[12:29] <ubotu> jughead: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[12:29] <jughead> Is it fairly reliable?
[12:29] <stefg> !install
[12:29] <ubotu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[12:29] <systemrestore> of course
[12:29] <LjL> jughead: fairly... but resizing partitions is never quite a safe operation
[12:29] <tonyyarusso> jughead: If you read the instructions, it's fine.
[12:30] <jughead> ok...  I would like to dual boot but resizing partitions seemed dangerous
[12:30] <LjL> jughead: you definitely should have a backup of data you care about
[12:30] <iwkse> jughead: take care cause laptops has hidden s... partition
[12:30] <thor> jughead: I have a 100G in my laptop and split it into four pieces...15G for windows, 25 G for FAT32 (d drive) 15G for fat32 (e drive) and the rest (30G) for linux
[12:30] <shadowsong> jughead: do you have windows on dual boot?
[12:30] <thor> jughead: the fat32 partitions can be accessed (r/w) by both linux and windows, so they contain pics, music, etc
[12:30] <jughead> thor did you do that after the windows partition was there, or did you reformat and create your partitions?
[12:31] <bimberi> jughead: you should make sure you have backups
[12:31] <iwkse> thor: the same with ntfs
[12:31] <thor> jughead: first, no ntfs cannot be written by linux...it is purely experimental right now.
[12:31] <SamuraiCat> jughead: I just went through repartioning a Windows laptop to dual boot into Ubuntu.
[12:31] <jughead> SamuraiCat were you successful?
[12:31] <iwkse> thor: thats not true
[12:31] <bimberi> jughead: the resizer is safe but doesn't claim perfection
[12:32] <systemrestore> i just did that samurai with an ibm netvista
[12:32] <jughead> ok that's pretty good
[12:32] <SamuraiCat> The partitioner built into the current install process is pretty good.
[12:32] <iwkse> jughead: you can use ntfs and write safetly with linux too
[12:32] <_r00t_> pppd: In file /etc/ppp/peers/gp: unrecognized option '/dev/rfcomm0'
[12:32] <_r00t_> anyone help me with it please
[12:32] <SamuraiCat> My two biggest pieces of advice: 1) Read the install guides on the web.  They're pretty good.
[12:32] <jughead> the size limit for a fat32 partition is what 30 gig?
[12:32] <thor> jughead: as for the partitioning, when the install gets to that point choose 'Custom', tell it to leave 15G for windows, and 30G for linux. YOu can create the fat32 in either system, at install or later
[12:32] <iwkse> jughead: no limit
[12:32] <systemrestore> 32
[12:32] <SamuraiCat> And 2) make sure to defragment your disk.
[12:32] <systemrestore> 32gb for fat
[12:33] <thor> iwkse: everything I have read about it states to be careful...ntfs right now is not stable
[12:33] <jughead> yeah I'll defreag before I change it around
[12:33] <SamuraiCat> And don't use the Windows defragmenter; it's crap.

[12:55] <Madeye> tonyyarusso, I used automatix right after the fresh install of edgy
[12:55] <tonyyarusso> Madeye: Ah.  That would be an issue.
[12:56] <regx_home> now i remember why i stopped using this distro.
[12:56] <tonyyarusso> Madeye: Automatix is known to break stuff frequently.
[12:56] <budluva_> can someone help me here, im trying to install the quake 3 demo, but sudo sh linuxq3ademo-1.11-6.x86.gz.sh pops up with an xterm window and says xterm: Can't execvp ./linuxq3ademo-1.11-6.x86.gz.sh: Permission denied
[12:56] <budluva_> root@smokey:~#
[12:56] <budluva_> 
[12:56] <regx_home> right outa the box i have errors with apt-get update.
[12:56] <budluva_> anyone have any idea how to fix this?
[12:56] <Madeye> tonyyarusso, darn, any way to roll things back
[12:56] <Pie-rate> why do ext3 partitions never need defragging?
[12:56] <sko0zy> can i please get help with GTKpod pleas???
[12:56] <RMorris84> does anybody know where i can find the kiba dock?
[12:56] <freddy_> hello..  can someone tell me which application should i use to create a Video DVD with some avi files i have here??
[12:56] <ikarug1> hi all. I have an Airnet awd154 wireless card and ubuntu is not recognizing it at all. It doesn't show up in lspci
[12:56] <regx_home> following UBUNTU directions to install mythtv fail due to the fact there are no repo's with mythtv
[12:56] <tonyyarusso> Madeye: Unfortunately, I don't know how to recover from it - there are some folks who can, but it's tricky.  It would probably be less bother to reinstall if that is an option for you.
[12:56] <GenNMX> budluva_: sudo chmod 755 the file first.
[12:56] <zylche> Can I get a get out of jail free card? I'm needing help playing monopoly!
[12:56] <Shaezsche> is it possible to set networkmanager to NOT automatically connect me?
[12:57] <budluva_> GenNMX, thanks brother
[12:57] <sysrage> glxgears -iacknowledgethatthistoolisnotabenchmark ?!?!
[12:57] <sysrage> wtf kinda flag is that lol
[12:57] <Shaezsche> also, does anyone know the touchpad synaptics command to delay touch clicks after typing?
[12:57] <freddy_> hello..  can someone tell me which application should i use to create a Video DVD with some avi files i have here??
[12:57] <Zaire> just need to do a chmod +x on the file
[12:57] <tonyyarusso> Pie-rate: Magic.  ;)  Actually, it has to do with the way the filesystem sorts things, which uses the space more efficiently on-the-fly.  Essentially, it defrags as part of it's normal operation.
[12:57] <Madeye>  tonyyarusso well, it's not what i fancy to do as I have done lots of customisations to my desktop
[12:57] <eilker> anyone using vmware??
[12:57] <Madeye> tonyyarusso, but as a last resort I might
[12:57] <sko0zy> who can help me out with gtkpod pleasE??
[12:57] <tonyyarusso> Madeye: Understandable.
[12:57] <ikarug1> hi all. I have an Airnet awd154 wireless card and ubuntu is not recognizing it at all. It doesn't show up in lspci
[12:58] <strabes> RMorris84: you have to use kiba-dock with a composite manager like xgl or aiglx
[12:58] <tonyyarusso> Madeye: If you can catch one of the precious few that have experience solving that sort of thing, perhaps you'll get lucky.
[12:58] <budluva_> GenNMX, now its popping up another terminal with some errors and closing on me, i cant read what its saying
[12:58] <RMorris84> freddy_: have u tried google? maybe "ubuntu avi to dvd"
[12:58] <Madeye> tonyyarusso, I hope so
[12:58] <strabes> RMorris84: there's how tos on wiki.beryl-project.org
[12:58] <RMorris84> strabes: i have xgl...
[12:58] <Madeye> tonyyarusso, Thank you for helping and thank you for your time :-)
[12:58] <Pie-rate> tonyyarusso: so why doesn't m$ adopt a similar system?
[12:58] <GenNMX> budluva_: Open up a terminal manually, don't do it from Run.
[12:58] <Dreamglider> when i watch video i have a lot of horisontal lines in the screen, and the bigger i make the video the more lines are in it, i have tried VLC and totem, with the same result. can annyone help ?
[12:59] <lllloo> hello folks
[12:59] <budluva_> GenNMX, im doing it from a term, and then its opening another term and closing too quickly to read
[12:59] <AnthonyG> Hello :D
[12:59] <RMorris84> but i cant find repo with the files i need, or a deb or anything for it.. since the beryl-project website went down
[12:59] <sko0zy> who can help me get music off my ipod onto my comp ??
[12:59] <budluva_> RMorris84, i just installed beryl a couple of days ago, theres a new mirror, check #beryl
[12:59] <notwist>  all the folders that I have copied are locked, even the ones that are done. do they stay that way until the "cp" process is done?
[01:00] <angryfirelord> install amaroK. I think that is iPod compatible
[01:00] <GenNMX> budluva_: You're using beryl?
[01:00] <strabes> RMorris84: the site is back up
[01:00] <notwist> sko0zy: sudo apt-get install amarok
[01:00] <Shaezsche> also, does anyone know the touchpad synaptics command to delay touch clicks after typing?
[01:00] <mzanfardino> I have what I hope is an easy question.  I have recently installed a ubuntu 6.10 server with a bad host name.  how do I change it?
[01:00] <tonyyarusso> Pie-rate: Actually, the original plan was for Vista to have something similar.  However, if you've been following that you'll know that a bunch of code was thrown out and they started over a couple of years ago as it became obvious that they simply weren't going to be able to make it work in the near enough future.  That was one of the features that was thrown out.
[01:00] <Shaezsche> is it possible to set networkmanager to NOT automatically connect me?
[01:00] <budluva_> GenNMX, yar :P maybe thats my problem? :P
[01:00] <RMorris84> strabes: i know but all their files are not there tho
[01:00] <GenNMX> budluva_: Yep.
[01:00] <sko0zy> notwist, ya i have amarok but i need some help
[01:00] <notwist> sko0zy: then ask in the amarok forums ;)
[01:00] <budluva_> GenNMX, nope, went back to metacity and still the same
[01:01] <Pie-rate> and that's why microsoft sucks i guess...
[01:01] <notwist> sko0zy: or google for it, most likely someone has had the same problem before
[01:01] <tonyyarusso> Pie-rate: ;)
[01:01] <mzanfardino> how do I change my hostname on my server?
[01:01] <sko0zy> notwist, its not that i have a problem its jsut that i wanna know how to just copy all the music off my ipod onto my comp
[01:01] <Pie-rate> i'll probably be sticking to winxp when vista comes out
=== Frankenstein_AFK is now known as Frankenstein
[01:02] <Pie-rate> at least for the computers running windows
[01:02] <tonyyarusso> mzanfardino: Change it in /etc/hostname as well as /etc/hosts and reboot
[01:02] <Dominus_Suu1> Is the translations section of Launchpad for writing software translations?
[01:02] <Pie-rate> this one isn't, and if wine works out well enough neither will my gaming box
[01:02] <tonyyarusso> Dominus_Suu1: Rosetta allows you to translate strings of anything in Ubuntu - the desktop, documentation, applications, etc. I believe.
[01:03] <notwist> sko0zy: atleast in windows (iTunes) you can't do that, but i suppose you should be able to do it in amarok. The thing is that the ipod has all the mp3 files laying around with weird file names
[01:03] <mzanfardino> tonyyarusso: thank you. trying that now
[01:03] <Dominus_Suu1> !rosetta'
[01:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rosetta' - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:03] <Dominus_Suu1> !rosetta
[01:03] <notwist> sko0zy: you COULD just go into the ipod and look up the mp3 files and copy them -- the ID3 tags are fine, just the filenames are not
[01:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rosetta - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:03] <tonyyarusso> Ubotu has no Rosetta factoid?  Odd.
[01:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about has no Rosetta factoid?  Odd. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:03] <tonyyarusso> oh hush
[01:04] <sko0zy> notwist, i know that gtkpod can copy them off withthe correct file names...i just get an error that i dont know what it means
[01:04] <notwist> sko0zy: what does it say then?
[01:04] <Dominus_Suu1> tonyyarusso - thanks

[01:09] <wastrel> oh jolly
[01:10] <Chewy954> :|
[01:10] <hazem> why there is no edgy in http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic ?
[01:10] <crimsun> Chewy954: it says the package name.
[01:10] <Dominus_Suu1> oh, and another thing: I'm a moron and I think I accidentally set my wiki.ubuntu page to be disabled forever?
[01:10] <crimsun> dredhammer: no.  http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/iceweasel
[01:10] <Chewy954> ok thx
[01:10] <Dominus_Suu1> *forever.  How do I get it back, create a new one?
[01:10] <regx_home> ive never seen so many questions and so little answers in an irc channel like this
[01:10] <wastrel> i'm going to guess that they haven't updated it yet hazem
=== siXy_ is now known as siXy
[01:10] <regx_home> yall should switch to ARCH LINUX  #archlinux
[01:10] <Chewy954> so far blag seems better than ubuntu
[01:11] <Chewy954> :|
[01:11] <Chewy954> first time ive used a debian
[01:11] <crimsun> regx_home: that's brilliant and utterly off-topic.
[01:11] <regx_home> guess what?
[01:11] <Chewy954> i only used fedora core b4
[01:11] <crimsun> no, I don't care to guess, thanks.
[01:11] <dredhammer> thank you crimsun
[01:11] <Chewy954> lol

[01:12] <weebit> how rude of em
[01:12] <jughead> alright; I downloaded perfectdisk 8 now I'm defreagging, but some stuff doesn't look like it's moving...
[01:12] <wastrel> what's perfectdisk?
[01:13] <i7ch> how stable is xgl/compwiz?
[01:14] <burnhamd> hello all i went ahead and did an upgrade from breezy to edgy
[01:14] <Junkey> hi, im looking for some help please.  trying to boot with a live cd and it keeps freezing up
[01:14] <burnhamd> edgy completely trashed it
[01:14] <burnhamd> so i decided to do a clean install but know nothing works not samba not my games
[01:14] <EdLin> burnhamd: you shouldn't upgrade two versions at once, first upgrade breezy to dapper, then dapper to badgy.
[01:15] <burnhamd> Edlin I meant dapper sorry
[01:15] <wy> Is there a easier way to setup samba?
[01:15] <wastrel> samba
[01:15] <wy> smb
[01:15] <rega> !samba
[01:15] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[01:15] <EdLin> !upgrading
[01:15] <rega> !smb
[01:15] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:15] <burnhamd> so basically im left with a unusable machine
[01:16] <EdLin> burnhamd: read the above documentation, it will explain a lot more a lot faster than getting it piecemeal here.
[01:16] <burnhamd> this is a clean install
[01:17] <rega> Anyone know if xgl works with vnc yet?
[01:17] <burnhamd> i ditched the upgraded system
[01:17] <burnhamd> would the beta nvidia driver make my games not work
[01:17] <burnhamd> ?
[01:17] <EdLin> try the stuff on Samba above, and if it doesn't work, then ask questions.
[01:18] <stefg> burnhamd: which had been predictable... skipping releases in the upgrade-process is not supported, and that's written everywhere... breezy to dapper, dapper to edgy would have been the way to go
[01:19] <Dominus_Suu1> I'm a moron and I think I accidentally set my wiki.ubuntu.com page to disable forever.  Even though forever means forever, is there a way to get a new one or it back?
[01:20] <wy> EdLin: Thanks!
[01:20] <EdLin> wy, np
[01:20] <burnhamd> stefg before responding please read my other lines
[01:20] <sko0zy> can anyone please help me with my ipod an GTKpod
[01:20] <puff> sko0zy: Idaknow, I'm having my own problems with gtkpod, but ask and I'll try.

[01:21] <Geewiz> my ubuntu is installed on a small disk that also has a windows partition on it, any idea how to delete the windows partition and expand my ubuntu partition to full size
[01:21] <tonyyarusso> Geewiz: GParted
[01:21] <puff> sko0zy: Shoot.
[01:22] <sko0zy> puff, alright
[01:22] <puff> Meanwhile, anybody have a link to a good kismet tutorial?
[01:22] <sko0zy> puff, just need to know ow i can copy my music of my ipod onto my comp
[01:22] <Junkey> trying to boot with a live cd, it gets to "starting gnome display manager", then "starting HP something something" then screen goes black, solid underscore cursor at the stop and machine freezes.  any recommendations please?
[01:23] <sko0zy> puff, i kno it seems simple but idunno
[01:23] <EdLin> Geewiz: if you mean moving the partition's beginning to a lower cylynder, that's not yet possible with parted and the like. You *could* make a big directory like /home or something use that partition, or back up your data and reinstall.
[01:23] <asparagui> jun: by freeze, do you mean the screen goes black?
[01:23] <weebit> thank goodness for logging chat  lol
[01:24] <Skwid_> where is the bluetooth config menu ?
[01:24] <sko0zy> puff, so u think u can help me out
[01:24] <Junkey> by freeze i mean the machine locks up, the only thing i can do is unplug the power
[01:24] <EdLin> weebit: if you were online all along most clients offer a /lastlog command. :)
[01:24] <bimberi> Junkey: so ctrl-alt-f1 doesn't switch to a text console ?
[01:24] <Angela_8008135> hi all! I am trying to recursivly leech a FTP, they are blocking wget globbing with the *, can anyone suggest a better way of doing this? TIA :)
[01:24] <EdLin>  /lastlong weebit to see all your messages. :)
[01:24] <Junkey> no
[01:24] <Junkey> its locked up
[01:24] <Geewiz> EdLin: probably could just format and reinstall, just kinda lazy
[01:25] <bimberi> Junkey: ok, boot into recovery mode and try reconfiguring X ...
[01:25] <bimberi> !xconfig | Junkey
[01:25] <ubotu> Junkey: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[01:25] <Junkey> sorry, but im really new to ubuntu and linux
[01:25] <Junkey> how do i open a  console
[01:26] <sko0zy> puff, u still there man?
[01:26] <LjL> !cli | Junkey
[01:26] <ubotu> Junkey: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[01:26] <Angela_8008135> Junkey it is also called a terminal, it is under system in your start menu
[01:26] <H3g3m0n> !tty
[01:26] <ubotu> To get to the tty terminals 1-6, use the keystroke ctrl + alt + F1-F6 respectively (Alt+F7 will get you back to your graphical login).
[01:26] <bimberi> Junkey: Recovery mode is one of the options on the boot menu, it will boot into text mode and you can run that command
[01:26] <Junkey> okay, ill try

[01:28] <LjL> Ubotu, tell sko0zy about ipod | sko0zy, see the private message from Ubotu
[01:28] <Angela_8008135> sko0zy just plug it in, it will detect it

[01:36] <kmull> firefoxjedi - sure thing
[01:36] <LjL> eilker: bad choice interrupting it, i'm afraid. you can try deleting the stuff manually, but... well.
[01:37] <sko0zy> puff, template (%o%a-%t.mp3%t.wav does not match the file type"media/ipod/ipod_control/music/f28/tvms.m4a
[01:37] <kmull> anyone? installing from a usb drive a possibility?
[01:37] <tonyyarusso> kmull: Yes.  There's a wiki page about it..not sure of the title.
[01:37] <firefoxjedi> kmull: except i've got to go pick someone up in a few mins ... arrrrrgggggghhhhhh.
[01:37] <kmull> tonyyarusso: is it the net install page?
[01:38] <jughead> this defrag is taking foreever
[01:38] <kmull> ahh BootFromUSB in the wiki
[01:38] <tonyyarusso> kmull: Nope - separate.  Search for usb install I'd think
[01:38] <tonyyarusso> Sounds right
[01:38] <tonyyarusso> Well, almost
[01:38] <tonyyarusso> Install from USB ideally
[01:38] <kmull> that talks about installing it onto the thumbdrive
[01:39] <kmull> is it is possible to install it -from- the thumbdrive not just onto it?
[01:39] <sko0zy> puff, any dieas or another program i might be able to use
[01:39] <kmull> got it
[01:39] <kmull> thanks
[01:39] <firefoxjedi> kmull: i saw a website last nite after doing a search for 'install damn small linux from flash drive' that had some good stuff, but i didn't bookmark it, i'm sure it would come up in a search again tho
[01:39] <puff> sko0zy: Ah, yeah, I've run into that.  Not sure what the fix is.   Have you googled on the message?
[01:40] <sko0zy> puff, not rele...but u dont know how u fixed it or what u did to fix it ?
[01:40] <kmull> firefoxjedi -- go to ubuntu.com's wiki page and search for "install usb" and there are some pages on there
[01:40] <kmull> try that
[01:40] <puff> sko0zy: I didn't fix it.  I'm guessing it's pretty trivial,
[01:41] <Dominus_Suu1> could someone please help me understand how Rosetta (the one through launchpad) works?  specifically, if I write translations in Rosetta, do they get implemented or recommended in the upstream package or are the translations only for Ubuntu?

[01:43] <Angela_8008135> sudo apt-get install wine
[01:43] <mamonassassina> Dominus_Suu1: good,is it in the repos?
[01:43] <Dominus_Suu1> mamon - but I've found it unreliable and prone to crashing
[01:43] <burnhamd_> how do i execute a .run file from command prompt?
[01:43] <sko0zy> puff, hmm
[01:43] <Dominus_Suu1> mamon - yep, in fact it's under Add Applications
[01:43] <mamonassassina> Dominus_Suu1: but does it have the feature i'm looking for?
[01:44] <Dominus_Suu1> mamon - yes.  When you load a torrent it lets you select which files you want to download
[01:44] <tonyyarusso> burnhamd_: ...what is it?
[01:44] <burnhamd_> nv.run

[01:45] <sko0zy> puff, oo i have .99.4

[01:46] <burnhamd_> i just want to know how to execute a .run file
[01:46] <LjL> burnhamd_: no, it isn't. is there a specific reason why you aren't using the packaged drivers, though?
[01:46] <Angela_8008135> all I see is nintendo nes and snes emulators in synaptic :/ no n64
[01:46] <Angela_8008135> cool, you guys got dgen too
[01:47] <LjL> Angela_8008135: i don't see one, either.
[01:47] <burnhamd_> im trying to peice back together my system the last time i used the packaged ones it broke it and i couldnt play games for 3 months

[01:48] <Angela_8008135> thanks Xappe
[01:48] <LjL> burnhamd_: and you think installing a driver using a .run file is a better idea? well, your decision. chmod +x filename ; ./filename (when you're in the right directory, of course)
[01:48] <whale> if i have a 7900 GT do i need to install nvidia-glx if i want to run XGL ?

[01:49] <burnhamd_> ok now thats its executable how do i run it?
[01:49] <burnhamd_> it just says command not found
[01:49] <LjL> burnhamd_: look carefully - there were two commands in what i said
[01:49] <LjL> one was chmod +x filename
[01:49] <LjL> the other was ./filename

[02:10] <H3g3m0n> !gtkpod | sko0zy
[02:10] <ubotu> gtkpod: manage songs and playlists on an Apple iPod. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.99.4-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 481 kB, installed size 1992 kB
[02:10] <P-Smurf> I hate asking for help, but can someone help me with my pre-install problem, i cant even get into live version, cd is fine, memtest works fine, safe graphics mode doesnt work either, i get a kernel paging, virtual address error
[02:11] <sko0zy> H3g3m0n, ya thas the problem i get a warning and then it freezes
[02:11] <user123> macd in your airport extreme?
[02:11] <job> anybody here using democracy TV?
[02:11] <bimberi> P-Smurf: Sounds like you'll need the alternate CD which has a text mode installer
[02:11] <macd> user123, I dont use it with apple equipment, ppc isnt only apple ;P
[02:12] <P-Smurf> ahh word, i forgot about that, ill try that thanks
[02:12] <macd> but that would work with an airport, yes
[02:12] <wastrel> anniem149:  try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:12] <zention> anniem149: try ctrl alt f1 (alt f7) to come back
[02:12] <user123> macd is a pcmcia
[02:12] <wastrel> do that one first ctrl-alt f1
[02:12] <macd> user123, yes it is
[02:12] <princemackenzie> how do i run bash scripts
[02:13] <princemackenzie> cause its dash now, right/
[02:13] <jrib> princemackenzie: bash file.sh
[02:13] <anniem149> ok.... ctrl alt F1 made it look pretty, too bad it didnt work :/
[02:13] <zention> princemackenzie: chmod 700 <script> ./<script>
[02:13] <Sir_Fawnpug> They changed bash to dash?
[02:13] <Dreamglider> when i watch video i have a lot of horisontal lines in the screen, and the bigger i make the video the more lines are in it, i have tried VLC  and totem, with the same result. can annyone help ?
[02:13] <Sir_Fawnpug> That's a shame, I rather liked having bash as my default shell.
[02:13] <jrib> Sir_Fawnpug: no, they made /bin/sh point to dash
[02:13] <wastrel> princemackenzie:  change the first line of the script from  #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash
[02:13] <Sir_Fawnpug> jrib, oh.
[02:14] <H3g3m0n> sko0zy: You could try coping the iPod_Control/Music directory off it and using easytag to rename the files to something readable
[02:14] <LjL> P-Smurf: Dapper? Intel card?
[02:14] <Sir_Fawnpug> princemackenzie, well as long as your script specifies bash instead of sh, I think you'll be OK
[02:14] <princemackenzie> thanks wastrel
[02:14] <eilker> hi, my dhcp is not working, i need to know or find a dhcpd.conf
[02:14] <user123> macd now I'm commecting wired...which comma
[02:14] <sakobatoneko> LjL ok i posted it
[02:14] <kishan> H3g3m0n: my swap is there in fstab but it shows as zero bytes in system monitor
[02:14] <LjL> sakobatoneko: i need the URL
[02:14] <Sir_Fawnpug> Anybody here happen to be well versed in posix?
[02:15] <user123> macd now I'm commecting wired...which command after plug?
[02:15] <jrib> Sir_Fawnpug: not I, but it's usually best to just ask your question
[02:15] <Sir_Fawnpug> Well it's a programming question so I didn't want to scare anyone away with it, just figured I might PM somebody.
[02:15] <P-Smurf> im not sure, its my gf's pc, and the douche that was working on it before never considered to check hardware compatibilities
[02:16] <tanubis> anyone know how to reset vlc?  I made some changes in the preferences since I got it, and now it won't start properly
[02:16] <LjL> P-Smurf: well this could be relevant - https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/53007
[02:16] <Sir_Fawnpug> But basically, I was wondering if the timeval struct in sys/types.h represented as tv_sec s + tv_usec us, or if they were different metrics of the same quantity
[02:16] <LjL> tanubis: http://www.videolan.org/doc/faq/en/index.html#id239102
[02:16] <H3g3m0n> kishan: It sounds like the fstab entry is incorrect and its not mounting, check that the partition exists and try it activating it manually with swapon , also you could check in 'top' in case the system monitor is wrong
[02:16] <tanubis> I essentially need to wipe all the settings clean and start again, but I can't figure out how to do it.  If I apt-get remove vlc (and associated files) and then install again, it remembers the old settings and still won't start properly
[02:17] <jrib> tanubis: sudo apt-get --purge remove vlc
[02:17] <H3g3m0n> tanubis: Check for a .vlc directory in your home folder
[02:17] <sakobatoneko> LjL http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/836528
[02:17] <tanubis> thankyou
[02:17] <LjL> tanubis, jrib: yeah, that's how you remove a package's *global* configuration files - but it won't work for the VLC config files that are stored in your home
[02:17] <stefg> tanubis: delete the ~/.vlc dir (a hidden one)
[02:18] <P-Smurf> LjL thats pretty much my error, same mobo
[02:18] <jason> wadup!!!
[02:18] <tanubis> ok
[02:18] <tanubis> thanks everyone
[02:18] <fdelacruz> sir anyone who is familiar w/ nagios
[02:18] <jason> i know all about beer
[02:18] <LjL> P-Smurf: well, skimming through the report, i don't seem to be seeing a workaround proposed - but at least you know the bug is confirmed
[02:18] <puff> sko0zy: Gotta run, late to meet somebody... sorry, but short of hand-installing gtkpod 99.8, Idkanow what to suggest.
[02:18] <fdelacruz> how can I change the appearanc eof my hists
[02:18] <fdelacruz> hosts sorry
[02:18] <LjL> P-Smurf: maybe you can help adding some information to it as well
[02:19] <lullabud> can you specify mode=777 or equivalent on the command line with mount??
[02:19] <lullabud> the man page is ambiguous.
[02:19] <Squeee> How do I change the default device/output for my sound?  When i push the volume button on my keyboard it adjusts the wrong control for sound.
[02:19] <P-Smurf> right on, im gonna try the alternate install though
[02:19] <LjL> Ubotu, tell lullabud about windowsdrives | lullabud, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:19] <user123> vlc is great to listen radio streaming work fine with streamtuner
[02:19] <Geewiz> anyone know how to use disk manager to merge a blank partition?
[02:19] <LjL> lullabud: i think that's explained on there
[02:19] <P-Smurf> then im gonna need to get all the info into a log file to send in
[02:19] <eilker> how can i make to run dhcpd server ?
[02:20] <lullabud> LjL:  that explains how to edit the fstab, but not a command to do the equivalent.
[02:20] <LjL> lullabud: the options should be the same, just use "mount blablah whatever -o <options>" - separated by commas
[02:20] <kishan> how to use the SWAPON COMMAND
[02:21] <snowzone> man swapon
[02:22] <kishan> UUID=2a3c04ff-30a6-498d-ad5e-88c6d66979c4 none swap sw 0 0
[02:22] <kishan> this is how my swap looks on fstab
[02:22] <kishan> can u help is the swap mounted
[02:23] <Guest676> Does anyone know of the equivalent for dlink media center software for windows, for linux?
[02:23] <kishan> system monitor shows 0 of o bytes
[02:23] <lullabud> LjL:  muchas gracias.  `mount -o fmask=0111,dmask=0000 /dev/sda1 /mnt/ntfs` doesn't seem to make sense, but it works so it's all good.
[02:23] <Geewiz> anyone know how to use disk manager to merge a blank partition?
[02:24] <jrib> lullabud: fmask is for files and dmask for directories
[02:24] <snowzone> kishan: what does swapon -s show?
[02:24] <lullabud> jrib:  i just don't understand how dmask=0000 equates to chmod 0555
[02:25] <kishan> snowzone: it shows nothing
[02:25] <LjL> sakobatoneko: "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list", and change it so that it looks like this instead: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/836538 -- note that i've added Universe and Multiverse for you (they were only partially enabled in your original file).  then type "sudo apt-get update", and see if it succeeds
[02:25] <jrib> lullabud: it doesn't, but if you are mounting ntfs it won't be writable.  So dmask gives you 777 everywhere, but because of ntfs you don't get the 222
[02:26] <kishan> snowzone: when i type that in terminal it hows nothing
[02:26] <jason> anyone know about installing quake3 demo?   I cant seem to get it working
[02:26] <snowzone> kishan: use the swapon command to try and enable your swap
[02:26] <jason> ive been reading on the forums but still cant get it
[02:26] <kishan> snowzone: how to use the command i am new to linux
[02:27] <snowzone> man swapon
[02:27] <Geewiz> anyone know how to use disk manager to merge a blank partition?
[02:27] <snowzone> kishan: type on the cmd line:  man swapon
[02:28] <carlfk> what would the downside of installing u-server and then apt-get install ubuntu-desktop ?
[02:28] <wastrel> kishan :  cat /proc/meminfo | grep Swap
[02:28] <lullabud> jrib: then why does dmask=0077 equate to chmod 500 ?
[02:28] <wastrel> that pipe is unnecessary
[02:28] <Spiceydog> can somoene help me with getting wine to work on ubuntu?
[02:29] <Spiceydog> anyone?
[02:29] <LjL> wastrel: hit yourself
[02:29] <carlfk> Spiceydog, not if you don't tell us what problems you are having
[02:30] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Spiceydog about wine | Spiceydog, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:30] <jrib> lullabud: same reasoning the 7's make it 0, and the fact that you have ntfs changes the first number from a 7 to a 5.
[02:30] <carlfk> how can I tell what packages I installed?
[02:30] <tritium> carlfk: dpkg -l
[02:30] <a7p> does anyone (for shure) if it is legal to publish software under a reduced GPL ala, this SW is available under GPL2.1 or later, but you may not modify and distribute the modified version?
[02:31] <jason> cls
[02:31] <jrib> lullabud: if you were mounting vfat you would end up with 700, but ntfs is like doing a mask of 222 again, so the 700 goes to 500
[02:31] <jason> wups
[02:31] <lullabud> jrib:  that makes little sense.  it would make sense if umask=0000 would do chmod 000, and other things would do what they do, except leaving the write bit at 0.
[02:31] <a7p> brother has got something like this on one of their webpages.
[02:31] <carlfk> tritium, know where that is stored?  my drive went poof - fsck got back about 80%.  I only backup /home, so it will be easy enough to reinstall
[02:31] <lullabud> jrib:  not that it's your fault or anything, it's just mildly frustrating that it's not more intuitive.
[02:32] <Spiceydog> ok... so i found that site.. but now where do i dl this "moderately recent version of Wine" from?
[02:32] <jrib> lullabud: no because with a umask=000 a file taht is 777 stays 777, a file that is 555 stays 555.  So it isn't the same as just chmodding to 0000
[02:32] <kishan> swapon: cannot stat /dev/disk/by-uuid/2a3c04ff-30a6-498d-ad5e-88c6d66979c4: No such file or directory
[02:32] <teka> hola a todos
[02:32] <teka> como estan?
[02:32] <tritium> !es
[02:32] <LjL> lullabud: that's octal notation for you... a file can be "executable" (1), "writable" (2) and "readable" (4). the sum of the three makes up one digit, so 7 is writable+readable+executable.  the "mask" is something that says which permissions should *not* be given to file - so a mask of 000 is saying "i'm fine with leaving all permissions on", thus 777.
[02:32] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[02:32] <kishan> this is what it show when i use swapon -a swapon: cannot stat /dev/disk/by-uuid/2a3c04ff-30a6-498d-ad5e-88c6d66979c4: No such file or directory
[02:33] <lullabud> jrib:  but how does that affect the mount point default?
[02:33] <LjL> !uuid | kishan
[02:33] <ubotu> kishan: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[02:33] <lullabud> er... that was directed to ljl.
[02:33] <LjL> kishan: check that the UUID for your swap partition actually matches what's in your fstab
[02:34] <LjL> lullabud: it affects it in that it decides which permissions should *not* be given to files in that mount. the rest is decided by the filesystem specifics -- so in the case of NTFS, you get all permissions on all files (i don't believe the ntfs driver actually looks for the real NTFS permissions), except for write permissions (since the NTFS driver doesn't know how to write, yet) - jrib correct me if i'm wrong
[02:34] <Geewiz> ubotu, fuck yourself
[02:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fuck yourself - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:35] <kishan> LjL: it does not match
[02:35] <LjL> kishan: then change it in fstab
[02:35] <kishan> LjL: let me try that
[02:35] <zention> a7p: heh, the gpl allows for modification
[02:36] <zention> a7p: it looks like you wish to maintain copyright on the work so the GPL is not a good licence
[02:37] <LjL> zention: the GPL definitely doesn't take copyright away for you...
[02:37] <jrib> lullabud: right, LjL makes the important point that with a filesystem like ntfs, the files don't have any permissions set on them.  So in this case, yeah it is just like chmodding everything because all the files start out the same way.  The idea of a mask becomes noticeable when you start with different things.  It might help to think about masks as they are using in graphic programs like photoshop or gimp
[02:37] <zention> LjL: well it does take away sole copyright

[02:38] <kishan> LjL: do i need to restart the sytem
[02:38] <LjL> kishan: i don't think... just try swapon -a again
[02:38] <a7p> zention, I do not want to do any of this stuff - but I just found SW doing this.
[02:38] <shuan> how do i know which version of ubuntu i have

[02:39] <LjL> kishan: with sudo. "sudo swapon -a"
[02:39] <zention> a7p: well it is a little silly of them to use GPL in that way another licence style would be better
[02:40] <kishan> LjL: thank you very much u r great now i can see it working
[02:40] <shuan> kishan
[02:40] <shuan> r u on msn
[02:40] <a7p> zention, that's what I thought, the GPL is explicitly granting the rights they deny ... so they've got a paradox in their license ..

[02:46] <H3g3m0n> XiXaQ: Don't use Xfce4 myself but i assume it works fine, you might need to edit the node conf to enable a XFCE4 mode on the server although it might just work by default

[02:53] <H3g3m0n> zylche: I recommend rockbox if you looking for a viable alternative to the appleOS, ipodlinux isn't really usable

[02:56] <LjL> GaiaX11_: i'm not sure which point... but anyway.
[02:56] <tom47> XiXaQ what i am saying is that the NX binaries in seveas repositories were built and and with dapper .... they will more than likely have dependancies that require dapper level software (though i am not certain that this is true in this particuar case) but in any case it is NOT recommended that you use software intended for use in one release in a later release as the results are unpredictable
[02:57] <zylche> tha.. that... ..that's disgusting! windows installers?!?!
[02:57] <LjL> eilker: you need to remove *all* the files that make up the virtual machine - there are a few, with extensions such as .vmx, vmdk or something... one (or several) is the virtual HD

[02:57] <LjL> eeh whatever
[02:58] <GaiaX11_> LjL, My point is: There are mor than one way of getting a result in Linux.
[02:58] <bimberi> Madpilot: scrollkeeper-update perhaps?  I don't know anything about it though.
[02:58] <tom47> XiXaC if you do not wish to make edgy packages, and can find them nowwhere else, and you want to use the NX stuff from seveas then you may well need to do so in dapper
[02:58] <H3g3m0n> timtrimble: You shouldn't need to
[02:58] <Spiceydog> uhh.. that pastebin site isnt loading for me.. everything else is. but not the pastebin
[02:58] <LjL> GaiaX11_: sure there are. but i don't see where i ever said anything to the contrary.
[02:58] <eilker> LjL: i just deleted ubuntu folder which is in /var/vm
[02:58] <Madpilot> bimberi, what is scrollkeeper, then?
[02:58] <LjL> Spiceydog: pastebin's down
[02:58] <Madpilot> (no, I haven't googled...)
[02:58] <Spiceydog> i c..........
[02:58] <timtrimble> h3g3m0n:  im triyng to use paltalk and it says it cant connect.  btw, nice name, if i rmember what book that's from correctly
[02:59] <Spiceydog> where do u want me to host is LjL?
[02:59] <LjL> eilker: hm, i think it's more likely that the directory you're looking for is in your home
[02:59] <AnthonyG> :|
[02:59] <LjL> Spiceydog: you can try ubuntu.pastebin.com - that's slow though
[02:59] <GaiaX11_> LjL,  You said that you gave him the correct answer. I also did, but in another way.
[02:59] <bimberi> Madpilot: idk, i'm looking into it too
[02:59] <Spiceydog> as long as it works im fine
[02:59] <XiXaQ> tom47, the server works just fine... I were asking how I could get it to work with xubuntu/xfce4, and not just gnome/kde.
[02:59] <jrib> Spiceydog: try http://www.rafb.net/paste/
[02:59] <LjL> GaiaX11_: then why did you address it to me, instead of him? just to gratuitously tell me about a command i didn't need?
[02:59] <AnthonyG> Honestly :|
[03:00] <LjL> jrib: is that better than pastebin.com?
[03:00] <jrib> LjL: it doesn't take 2 weeks to load
[03:00] <H3g3m0n> timtrimble: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=918 Looks like it just doesn't work under wine
[03:01] <bimberi> Madpilot: there's an entry in cron.monthly for it
[03:01] <Spiceydog> the only thing i prefer about windows xp is that ctrl-c works.. all the time... i cant ctrl-c addresses here
[03:01] <jrib> Spiceydog: ctrl-shift-c in the terminal, because ctrl-c already means something else
[03:01] <Madpilot> bimberi, ah, OK... googling isn't being very helpful about scrollkeeper currently...
[03:01] <timtrimble> h3g3m0n:  tanks anyway
[03:02] <Spiceydog> jrib: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/e6Nwxf18.html
[03:02] <Spiceydog> ok
[03:02] <zention> Spiceydog: heh, ctrl-c sends a control signal to interupt it can be remapped by software and ignored on any OS
[03:02] <bimberi> Madpilot: 'man scrollkeeper' is though.  "... When applications install documentation,  the  documentation is registered with ScrollKeeper ..."
[03:02] <jrib> Spiceydog: ok, you see those last two lines.  Do you know anything about them?

[03:03] <LjL> !nfs | kishan
[03:03] <ubotu> kishan: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[03:03] <Spiceydog> i no absoultely nothing about them jrib
[03:03] <LjL> kishan: as for why it's installed, i don't know
[03:03] <Madpilot> bimberi, ah, got it. It's what keeps 'man' files findable, I guess

[03:03] <LjL> GaiaX11_: alright then. that was the entire point of my argument - it simply seemed like you were correcting me rather than giving an answer to him :)
[03:03] <kishan> LjL: is it used for networking nfs server
[03:04] <jrib> Spiceydog: ok, do this:  gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list   you don't need outside repositories, so we'll delete them
[03:04] <LjL> kishan: it is used for file sharing on a network
[03:04] <bimberi> Madpilot: yes, it seems that way (although there is 'mandb' for that)
[03:04] <kishan> LjL: i think i installed it by mistake i was just tryting to mess around ubuntu i did some thing with the netwroking thing
[03:05] <LjL> kishan: try typing "sudo apt-get remove nfs-kernel-server" - but *don't* choose Yes, interrupt it just after it tells you which packages it's going to remove. and tell me what those packages are
[03:05] <Spiceydog> i typed that in jrib... not sure wut it did

[03:07] <jrib> Fletch229: you try to avoid using rpm's.  What are you trying to install?
[03:07] <DevC> yeah I saw the gftp gtk package

[03:08] <jrib> Fletch229: you can install limewire and I will send you instructions, but I would recommend you use frostwire instead
[03:09] <jrib> !frostwire | Fletch229
[03:09] <ubotu> Fletch229: frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[03:09] <w3ccv> ryanakca, works with Firefox 2 on FC4
[03:09] <Fletch229> frostwire never heard of it
[03:09] <kishan> LjL: yes it says they are no more reqired
[03:09] <ryanakca> thanks, must be my messed up Firefox
[03:09] <DevC> ryanakca: what should be loading? a page or something else?
[03:09] <LjL> kishan: well, then it should be safe to just remove nfs-kernel-server ... i wonder how it got installed, though. did you recall ever installing it explicitely? seems like a strange package to stumble upon "by mistake"
[03:09] <w3ccv> ryanakca, it's the (htdocs) root directory - no html files
[03:09] <jrib> Fletch229: give it a try, it's the same thing basically (it's actually a fork i believe).  If you still want the limewire instructions though, you can  /msg ubotu limewire  and he should tell you
[03:10] <Fletch229> ok thanks
[03:10] <DevC> w3ccv: beat me to it lol
[03:10] <ryanakca> DevC, the root directory, no webpage or index file...
[03:10] <w3ccv> DevC,  sri
[03:10] <ryanakca> w3ccv: that's how it's supposed to be :)
[03:10] <DevC> ryanakca: well it loads the index page for me under firefox

[03:14] <ubotu> You can download a Flash 9 installer here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/backports/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy).  If you use GDebi to install it, make sure you open its terminal window (to answer an installer question).
[03:14] <brianski> H3g3m0n: thank you!
[03:14] <LjL> kishan: hm, well, i'd say not, generally speaking. you're probably better off using Samba (which is a network filesystem that's compatible with the standard Windows one) over NFS. your mileage may vary though
[03:15] <kishan> LjL: can u give me some good guide to read to study this samba and nfs one which is good for begineers

[03:16] <kishan> LjL: so u say samba is much more easy and faster than nfs
[03:16] <jrib> Zarephath: dpkg -L package_name  should tell you where it installed files to
[03:16] <kitche> kishan: samba has wonderful documentation on their website
[03:16] <Zarephath> jrib: Ok thanks
[03:16] <LjL> kishan: no, i'm saying that it uses the protocol that Windows uses by default, so with Samba you won't need to install anything on your Windows machines

[03:18] <Zarephath> jrib: Same issue I don't see the files themselves..I had used synaptic to do the same thing you showed me with dpkg
[03:18] <nothinbutnet> one of the ff flash plugins is known to crash in edgy

[03:18] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.

[03:20] <LjL> kishan: not really. i did publish one or two mostly-non-working little programs on sourceforge, but that's about it. and this is offtopic here anyway ;)
[03:20] <Links234> ahhh
[03:20] <user123> linux-restricted-modules: how to use?
[03:20] <JohnFlux> Links234: good luck ;-)
[03:20] <Links234> this is really confusing... IM usied to damn win2k
[03:20] <JohnFlux> Links234: not sure wine is useful for beginners
[03:20] <Links234> what is then?
[03:21] <Zarephath> Learning Linux
[03:21] <kishan> LjL: but thank you for your help it was a great deal able to learn something today about linux from you
[03:21] <JohnFlux> Links234: it's like a linux person coming to windows and asking how to run linux programs
[03:21] <JohnFlux> Links234: would you know how to answer them? :)
[03:21] <LjL> kishan: you're quite welcome
[03:21] <Links234> ...no
[03:21] <Spiceydog> ok jrib. its all done. anything else i gotta do?
[03:21] <JohnFlux> Links234: exactly.
[03:21] <jrib> Spiceydog: nope, you should have wine now
[03:21] <Spiceydog> sweeeeet
[03:21] <jrib> Spiceydog: you know how to use it?
[03:22] <Spiceydog> nope
[03:22] <Spiceydog> no clue
[03:22] <Links234> but i also tried installing xchat... and i have no clue how to open it now O_o
[03:22] <jrib> ubotu: tell Spiceydog about wine
[03:22] <JohnFlux> Links234: feel free to have fun.  it's good to learn
[03:22] <LjL> Links234 - see, if you're very lucky, you can open a console, and type "wine ~/Desktop/SomeProgram.exe" (assuming the .exe file is on your desktop, and note that case matters). but WINE doesn't always work
[03:22] <Links234> yea i know
[03:22] <LjL> Links234, it should end up in the Applications menu i think
[03:22] <Links234> no i looked
[03:22] <Links234> but i went into add/remove then i clicked on it...
[03:23] <Links234> and it said uhh
[03:23] <LjL> Links234: then Alt+F2 and type "xchat". you can add it manually to the menu, by using the menu editor
[03:23] <ryanakca> DevC: back... see my apache setup? where? the *points to /msg*
[03:23] <Zarephath> Links234, : Just type xchat from a term window'
[03:23] <Links234> ok
[03:23] <BrokenPipe> Is there a graphical Partition Manager that can create Logical Volumes?
[03:23] <Links234> any command to add it?
[03:23] <Zarephath> BrokenPipe, : gparted
[03:23] <LjL> Links234: sometimes, however, i've noticed that new programs are only added to the menu after a reboot (or X restart). your mileage may vary.
[03:24] <kishan> BrokenPipe: try qtparted u can dowload it from add/remove programs
[03:24] <cratel2> Zarephath: can a logical volume be bootable?
[03:24] <tritio> please I need a manual Shell commands,
[03:24] <BrokenPipe> Zaraphath: I don't see anything about LVM in gparted
[03:24] <Zarephath> Links234, : Are you using gnome or what?
[03:24] <LjL> Links234, i think it involves right clicking on the Applications menu and invoking the menu editor... but i'm not a Gnome user myself
[03:24] <Links234> umm...
[03:24] <Links234> pl
[03:24] <DevC> ryanakca: no I mean to for the future I'd recommend hadding a missing.html that is pointed to when a file is missing or the url is wrong so people don't see your index of/ stuff for apache
[03:24] <linux_kid> Anyone know how to fix this: i installed server edition on an older pc, and now when i try to boot it, grub loads, then it says its booting, but then it stps after about 6 lines of code... any suggestions?
[03:24] <jrib> ubotu: tell tritio about cli
[03:24] <DevC> could cause major security issues
[03:24] <ryanakca> DevC: ah...
[03:24] <Links234> thanks! i got it
[03:25] <tritio> yes jrib
[03:25] <Zarephath> cratel2: Try using fdisk and seeing yourself...if you have a logical partition created ;-)
[03:25] <jrib> tritio: did ubotu send you a private message with some useful info?
[03:25] <ryanakca> DevC: or I could just go "sudo touch /var/www/htdocs/index.html && sudo echo 'nothing to see here' > /var/www/htdocs/index.html" :)
[03:25] <cratel2> Zarephath: I'm installing dapper with an alternate install CD. It would be nice to know now.
[03:25] <tritio> Ok thnk

[03:26] <P-Smurf> Does Xubuntu support multiple video cards running simultaneously?
[03:26] <mikael> how do I hibernate from the console?  it works great from the GNOME menu thing
[03:26] <cratel2> Zarephath: intuitively it doesn't make sense that you could have a logical volume that is bootable, but the alternate install CD appears to be letting me do this.
[03:26] <Zarephath> Links234, : You can also right click on the desktop and create a icon to run xchat that way
[03:26] <Links234> mkay thanks...
[03:26] <LjL> ryanakca: that won't work (the second part), unless /var/www/htdocs is writable by the user (not just by root). that's because the '>' redirect will be done by the shell, which is not running as root.
[03:27] <LjL> ryanakca: what you need in those cases is   sudo sh -c "echo whatever >/somefile"
[03:27] <Zarephath> cratel2: I don't believe it would be advisable to do such.however I am not there and don't know your system...

[03:28] <P-Smurf> LjL: im working on a bypass for the intel video problem, but does xubuntu support dual vid cards? if it does, the on-board works then i could load the intel card
[03:28] <Zarephath> jrib: I tried all the xml files actually....got a core dump once
[03:28] <jrib> Zarephath: yeah, seems to crash, do you know what lesson files are supposed to be like?
[03:28] <Zarephath> jrib: I found it strange there wasn't a xml file named lesson.xml
[03:28] <LjL> mikael: you can try /etc/acpi/hibernate.sh - but i don't think that's the same script that GNOME called. i don't know what exactly GNOME does to invoke hibernation

[03:29] <Cybah> Does anyone know the status of JFS and quotas? I'm using linux-image-2.6.17-10-server and quotaon says "Invalid argument"... have got the filesystem mounted with {usr,grp}quota
[03:29] <Zarephath> jrib: There in lies the issue..I too have never used the software...I will go to sourceforge and see if I can ask on a mailing list or something..thanks for looking though!
[03:30] <superchode> sorry for hopping in and immediately asking questions... but i have a question
[03:30] <LjL> P-Smurf: dual video cards, it should definitely support, but i've never tried that.
[03:30] <Angela_816_80085> Hi all! I borqued my azureus by entering an invalid port... sorry for the noobie question, but, how do I find a valid port? TIA :)

[03:30] <Links234> anotehr question...
[03:30] <P-Smurf> LjL: well im working on it, just very unsure on how to implement it
[03:30] <Links234> are there any ATI drivers for ubuntu 6.1?
[03:30] <superchode> the option is boot/install... and the cd detects the bork and boots it
[03:30] <Links234> for x1600 series?
[03:30] <P-Smurf> cause then i could post my findings
[03:31] <strawtarget> I have my system clock set to local time.  The installer for dapper and edgy seem to insist that it's utc.  How can I install with the correct timezone settings?  I've searched and found lots of threads and tracker entries but not a solution.  (it's possible that I suck at searching.)
[03:31] <superchode> how do i get to the install menu so i can format the partition(s) and clean install?
[03:31] <Angela_816_80085> Links234 you will need the binary ones from ati I think...
[03:31] <Zarephath> superchode, : Try rescue mode...
[03:31] <azion> Hello all, can anyone tell me where I can get 855
[03:31] <azion> resolution
[03:31] <jrib> Zarephath: umm ok I got it to work, I think
[03:31] <Links234> i think you need the bios fix
[03:31] <diskus> 855 resolution?
[03:31] <Links234> azion ^
[03:32] <Zarephath> jrib: What file did you open?
[03:32] <Angela_816_80085> anyone know how I can find a valid port for azerus? TIA :)
[03:32] <superchode> is rescue mode one of the options?
[03:32] <Angela_816_80085> TCP listen port
[03:32] <LjL> P-Smurf: well, problem is, if i'm interpreting the bug report correctly (it's a bit messy...), the kernel is panicing before it even loads X. if this is the case, you'd have to find a way to make the kernel completely ignore your card - and i'd have no idea how.
[03:32] <jrib> Zarephath: none, I imported and then started a new lesson
[03:32] <Zarephath> Angela_816_80085, : Try googling for p2p ports
[03:32] <Spiceydog> hey how do u view ur 'processes' in ubuntu?
[03:32] <superchode> or does it require special triggering?
[03:32] <jrib> Zarephath: I think open may be if you save your progress
[03:32] <w3ccv> strawtarget, easiest tis o change the hardware clock to UTC

[03:37] <bimberi> kishan: ports are opened by processes running on your PC.  For example an ssh server will open port 22 by default
[03:37] <zspada15> FFForever, is it mounted on your desktop?
[03:37] <doki> FFForever, I got one, and I just have to plug it on USB^^
[03:37] <w3ccv> I could set the HW clock to LT but then email would not coordinat wiht the rest of the world
[03:37] <kishan> bimberi: does that command open ports its showing a list of detaials
[03:37] <FFForever> it dose not ask to mount
[03:37] <FFForever> i dont see it on my desktop

[03:38] <w3ccv> FFForever, does it show in `df`

[03:39] <w3ccv> FFForever, you'd see the device mounted, probably as /media/usbdisk
[03:39] <FFForever> no
[03:39] <bimberi> kishan: after the colon in the 4th column.  eg. 0.0.0.0:68  is port 68

[03:49] <kitche> DevC: you have to get libdvdcss from a 3rd party repo since it's illegal to have it in the US so they didn't put it in the repos

[04:07] <bimberi> esquilax: kk :(
[04:08] <jrib> jaebird: have you tried some random jpeg from google? does that work?
[04:08] <kitche> Spiceydog: add it to your sources.list then do sudo apt-get update then install wine
[04:08] <ozoneco> does Ubuntu have a mail server that can be installed?
[04:09] <kitche> ozoneco: yes it has a couple
[04:09] <ozoneco> kitche: should they be found in my package manager?
[04:09] <wastrel> ozoneco:  there are several.  sendmail, postfix and exim among others
[04:09] <kitche> ozoneco: yes sendmail postfix is just two popular ones
[04:09] <jaebird> jrib: I have not tried them...as I have thousands of jpegs from my photo library that i could open earlier
[04:09] <VigoFusion> Evolution is one e.mail client that comes with Ubuntu
[04:10] <links234_> -.-
[04:10] <jrib> jaebird: oh I see, wasn't sure from your description if this was a specific jpeg giving you problems.  but never mind then
[04:10] <VigoFusion> I use Thunderbird, it installed easily and works great.
[04:10] <anniem149> is there any reason why i cannot go to the directory - /etc/x11
[04:10] <bimberi> anniem149: because it's capital X
[04:11] <anniem149> it still wont let me
[04:11] <strabes> anniem149: it's X11
[04:11] <strabes> anniem149: with a capital X
[04:11] <jrib> anniem149: what command are you using?
[04:11] <anniem149> cd /etc/X11
[04:11] <strabes> anniem149: try sudo
[04:11] <Spiceydog> how do i open /etc/apt/sources.list?
[04:11] <Spiceydog> i forgot..
[04:11] <nalioth> anniem149: it is very much recommened that you stay out of system space
[04:11] <strabes> Spiceydog: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:11] <strabes> it's a text document
[04:11] <Madpilot> Spiceydog, sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:12] <anniem149> i know, but i am installingvia virtual pc and my graphics are fubar
[04:12] <strabes> newer people seem to like gedit better than nano
[04:12] <bimberi> anniem149: probably fubar due to having no /etc/X11 I'd say
[04:12] <strabes> haha
[04:12] <nalioth> strabes: it's gksudo please to open gtk apps as superuser
[04:12] <Madpilot> strabes, sure, but nano is sane, and it works even if they're X-less
[04:12] <jaebird> png files still open fine with eog
[04:12] <strabes> Madpilot: indeed
[04:13] <nalioth> strabes: using 'sudo' will muck up permissions
[04:13] <anniem149> but when i list it, it shows up in blue
[04:13] <VigoFusion> I am still on the fence tween gedit and nano, they both have there good
[04:13] <strabes> nalioth: no, it just does the command as root
[04:13] <bimberi> anniem149: what's the output of 'file /etc/X11' ?
[04:13] <nalioth> !tell strabes about gksudo
[04:13] <jrib> Madpilot: not much of a nano user, but do you need to use -w to ensure it doesn't put in extra line breaks?
[04:13] <anniem149> i dunno :)  show me :)
[04:13] <strabes> nalioth: oh i thought you were asking me
[04:13] <Spiceydog> ok how do i add http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt to my sources.list?
[04:13] <VigoFusion> !gksudo
[04:14] <ubotu> If you need to run graphical applications as root, use gksudo, as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using "sudo <GUI-application>"
[04:14] <Madpilot> jrib, not sure; I never have, and I've poked at my sources.list w/ nano more than once
[04:14] <bimberi> anniem149: alright. "/etc/X11: directory"  here
[04:14] <Megaqwerty> Spiceydog: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:14] <jrib> Spiceydog: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine  tells you exactly:  deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt edgy main  if you are on edgy
[04:14] <strabes> Megaqwerty: they recommend that you use gksudo if you're going to run a graphical application
[04:15] <strabes> Megaqwerty: instead of sudo
[04:15] <Megaqwerty> meh. still works from terminal
[04:15] <Spiceydog> wait... im confused... jrib: wuts edgy main?
[04:15] <strabes> Megaqwerty: i dont really know why; ive never had a problem with it
[04:15] <strabes> Megaqwerty: i know
[04:15] <anniem149> no such file or directory
[04:15] <uri> Hey, I seem to be having a problem getting WINE to run Steam on my system. Can anybody help me/point me to a place where I could get help?
[04:15] <jrib> Spiceydog: do you see how the other lines in that file are structured?  They start with deb, then a url, then a repository, then a component
[04:16] <pngwen> Is there anyway I can exclude xmms from showing up in the gnome tasklist?

[04:16] <pngwen> err... the gnome window list.  sorry, forgot the gnome speak for it.
[04:17] <jrib> Spiceydog: if you are really interested in the structure:  http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-basico.en.html#s-sources.list
[04:17] <anniem149> nm, i went back to root and tried again - happy :)
[04:17] <anniem149> thanks!
[04:17] <ozoneco> ok, between the 3, sendmail, postfix, and exim,....all with gui? best choice for gui?
[04:18] <ozoneco> just for the maint
[04:18] <tritio> could I know if my kernel find the scanner
[04:18] <pi1l> how do i resize a fat 32 partition and add ext3 partition to my disk?
[04:18] <craigbass1976> Where can I start looking for why ubuntu is so slow?  I had an edgy install running two days ago, but had to install dapper to try something out, and for some reason it drags.  Xorg is at the top of the list when I do a top, but no numbers are going very high in anything there.
[04:18] <Spiceydog> im not really interested in 'structure' but wut im really trying to do is get wine working so i can run a simple exe program.. but i need to update wine. and to update wine i need to do something else.. and to do that something else i need to stick http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/ into the sources.list then do some kinda update thing
[04:18] <pngwen> ozoneco: I would use postfix.  It's the most secure and easiest to configure.  No gui to speak of, but it is super simple.
[04:19] <strabes> pi1l: boot from the live cd and use gparted that comes withit
[04:19] <jrib> Spiceydog: I told you exactly what to put in there, and the wiki page does too
[04:19] <zac1> !c++
[04:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about c++ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:19] <Spiceydog> o sry jrib.. can u resend that link plz?
[04:19] <pi1l> strabes, can i do it without rebooting?
[04:19] <craigbass1976> Also, does the xmms player you can get in add/remove software play streaming mp3?  If it doesn't, what does?  I'd like some tunage while I'm installing Ubuntu on another box.
[04:19] <tritio> could I know if my kernel find the scanner
[04:19] <ozoneco> pngwen: thanks, i'll go that way
[04:19] <zac1> ;ubotu
[04:20] <jrib> Spiceydog: according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine, if you are on ubuntu edgy you add this line:   deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt edgy main
[04:20] <jaebird> Fixed it :)
[04:20] <pngwen> ozoneco: no problem.  You'll want to find postfix's homepage and read their docs.

[04:21] <Crell> Hi all.  I'm having an issue setting up a mail server using Ubuntu-Server Edgy.  Specifically, postfix+sasl+mysql.  I have postfix using sasl for SMTP Auth, but sasl is trying to authenticate against /etc/sasldb2, which doesn't exist.  I have an smtpd.conf file for it that should be telling it to use MySQL, but it's getting ignored.
[04:21] <ozoneco> pngwen: can you tell me about 2 smtp servers, how would they share/forward authorization to each other?
[04:21] <bimberi> tritio: try running XSane.  Applications -> Graphics -> XSane Image Scanner.  If your scanner is detected it will work.
[04:21] <edbe> hallo, how do you convert mov files to smaller mov/avi files with mplayer?
[04:21] <Crell> The postfix docs list about 4 places that file could live.  Both the Ubuntu and Debian tutorials I've found say to use /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf.  I've tried all of the above, to no avail.  Any suggestions?

[04:29] <craigbass1976> bimberi, Well, I don't know which one it was, but I found a hp 3820 I'd forgotten about.  Bought ink today, and got a blinking light.  Talked to hp chat (fairly useless)  Turns out there was a missing piece of metal in the carriage that tells the printer there's an ink cartridge there.

[04:58] <ice_cream> i dont want to kill it!!
[04:58] <Virtuall> tabs remain!
[04:58] <jrib> ice_cream: maybe alt-click on it and drag
[04:58] <matthew_> ice_cream, that way, next time you will have session restore enabled, so that you can restore the tabs
[04:58] <Virtuall> it asks if you want to restore the session
[04:58] <ixian_> shoudl be able to right click on firefox in the window list, go to move, then click on the part of the window you can see
[04:58] <ice_cream> jrib,  yes!!! alt click!
[04:58] <ice_cream> ty
[04:58] <Virtuall> :P

[05:02] <matthew_> sam1982, , It will look different and have different default packages installed
[05:02] <matthew_> sorry Kmull
[05:02] <sam1982> Matthew ~ i know that much
[05:02] <craigbass1976> hehe... xmms plays mp3 streams...
[05:02] <kmull> so i have no CD rom, no ethernet port, no bootable usb, and a plug in wireless card that isn't detected, and a busted up windows xp. how do i get ubuntu on here?
[05:03] <DevC> matthew_: meant matix, it's my matrix trilogy that I'm trying to watch but either way the site is down right now
[05:03] <matthew_> sam1982, sorry, I assume everyone I deal with has no knowledge, it's easier that way
[05:03] <matthew_> DevC, ah...ok, well, darn that's a bummer
[05:03] <sam1982> haha  matthew  its ok..
[05:03] <sysdoc> matthew_, lmao!!
[05:03] <craigbass1976> kmull, how did you end up with no ethernet?
[05:03] <ozoneco> any ideas why telnet fails?
[05:03] <matthew_> DevC, when it gets up again, install automatix and download AUD-DVD codecs under Multimedia
[05:03] <strabes> how did you get xp on tehre in the 1st place with no CD drive
[05:04] <Madpilot> !automatix | matthew_
[05:04] <ubotu> matthew_: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[05:04] <kmull> craigbass, it is a really, really old laptop. it has a phone plug.
[05:04] <cratel2> is there some sort of RAID notification applet for when the RAID fails? I'd like it to send me an email or something. I thought this was standard in various linux distros but I can't find anything for ubuntu...
[05:04] <matthew_> well, I don't care what you say, bot, I love it
[05:04] <craigbass1976> Ahhh.  I've got one of those.  Canon innova book
[05:04] <H3g3m0n> kmull: How can you tell the wireless isn't detected?
[05:04] <matthew_> yup, me too, IBM thinkpad 600e
[05:05] <Madpilot> matthew_, "works for me" is not enough of a reason to recommend a tool known to cause problems
[05:05] <craigbass1976> kmull, I think you're out of luck, unless you can get one of those plug in ethernet cards
[05:05] <matthew_> Madpilot, very well.
[05:05] <DevC> Madpilot: he was just recommending it because the links LjL gave me didn't fix my not being able to view dvds
[05:05] <kmull> because when i go through grub and it starts to configure, it asks me to put in proxy info or leave it blank, then says the mirror isn't detected
[05:05] <H3g3m0n> kmull: Do you have a cdrom drive in there, jsut one that doesn't boot?
[05:05] <strabes> matthew_, devc, actually you should go here.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats?highlight=%28restricted%29people don't like automatix here.
[05:06] <kmull> h3g3m0n it has a cd drive, but it doesn't work.
[05:06] <matthew_> strabes, well, that's is a bummer as well...
[05:06] <unikon> can anyone point out a link as to where i can have a friend of mine goto to use screenshots how to install ubuntu on her desktop
[05:06] <strabes> matthew_: i know; i like automatix2 a lot myself
[05:06] <H3g3m0n> kmull: Floppy drive atleast?
[05:06] <matthew_> strabes, kinda similar to "we don't like coloreds around here" ?
[05:06] <strabes> matthew_: i think
[05:06] <matthew_> lol
[05:07] <matthew_> no offense intended to anyone...
[05:07] <Madpilot> matthew_ & strabes - not funny.
[05:07] <strabes> but !etiquitte
[05:07] <kmull> H3g3m0n - this, yes. but my desktop doesn't have a floppy to use a floppy disk
[05:07] <strabes> if i spelled it correctly
[05:07] <matthew_> sorry all
[05:07] <strabes> !etiquette

[05:07] <DevC> MadPilot: I did everything the site LjL gave me about getting plugins and such for totem in order to play dvds and after installing everything it said to install I still can't watch a dvd through totem because even after restart it goes on about plugins
[05:08] <H3g3m0n> kmull: Is there nonbootable usb on there?
[05:08] <Madpilot> DevC, totem-xine should play DVDs
[05:08] <kmull> H3g3m0n - yes. nonbootable usb does function.
[05:08] <strabes> DevC: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats?highlight=%28restricted%29

[05:09] <H3g3m0n> kmull: You should beable to boot of a usbdrive from within grub
[05:10] <tx22> Guys, wondering if any of you could help me. Currently I have a athlon 3200+ but wondering about upgrading. The core 2 duo looks very nice, but if I got that, I'd have to sell my athlon + mobo on ebay, and I am not sure if I'd get a good deal. Should I upgrade to a 4500 or something?.. Cheers
[05:10] <DevC> strabes: hmmm that isn't what LjL gave me earlier :o
[05:10] <matthew_> intel > AMD
[05:10] <matthew_> go for intel, quicker and cooler
[05:10] <strabes> DevC: you're right; that is the wrong page. sorry
[05:10] <matthew_> well, cooler for sure
[05:11] <matthew_> and the core 2 duo kicks glutes
[05:11] <superchode> k, install is broken.... CD boot/install option merely boots the bad install and craps out... and boot: rescue kernel panics... is there any way to force the cd to begin the install process so that i can wipe the partition and install fresh?
[05:11] <strabes> DevC: try installing libdvdcss2
[05:11] <kmull> H3g3m0n can you walk me through that in private chat?
[05:11] <mglnxx> hi
[05:11] <Plimmer> The core 2 is awesome, but if you dont want to use alot of money a new amd would be nice to. :)
[05:11] <strabes> superchode: the alternate install cd
[05:11] <ethos_> !askthebot
[05:11] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[05:11] <Plimmer> Perhaps an X2, if your mobo supports it.
[05:11] <tx22> matthew_: well, how much do you think I'd get if I sold my current cpu + motherboard?
[05:11] <matthew_> what? it's only about 900 dollars...
[05:11] <mglnxx> I got this crash message "cdda:///dev/hdd" is not a valid location.
[05:11] <tx22> Plimmer:  Yeah, it supportd x2
[05:12] <superchode> strabes: do you have a link for that?
[05:12] <VigoFusion> Any hardware that you buy today was manufactured 3 years ago, so never be in a hurry to get hardware. (a lesson learned after $$$ wasted)
[05:12] <superchode> is it called 'alternate install cd'?
[05:12] <DevC> strabes: the site LjL gave me had that as the first step then had me activate universe and multiverse to download several gstream plugins ffsomething, bad-multiverse, bad, ugly, and ugly-multiverse
[05:12] <tx22> VigoFusion:  so, you're saying that it's best to buy an amd?.. or you mean a core 2 duo?
[05:12] <mglnxx> this "cdda:///dev/hdd" is not a valid location. happens when I try to open a CD audio with Nautilus
[05:13] <mglnxx> is it possible to open a CD audio in Nautilus?
[05:13] <strabes> superchode: enter in terminal: sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2
[05:13] <matthew_> mglnx, maybe to open an audio cd...
[05:13] <strabes> superchode: do you have the extra repositories enabled?
[05:13] <matthew_> mglnx, but I think you need a media player for media....
[05:13] <H3g3m0n> kmull: Check PM
[05:13] <strabes> DevC: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats?highlight=%28restricted%29#head-38508785e53c611dde1859232189b2e823135eb9
[05:14] <kmull> on it
[05:14] <VigoFusion> tx22: Stay with what works for you now, improve on it if you are able, but if you have a cash cow, buy the lot.
[05:14] <strabes> superchode: nm that last message. what is your problem again? sorry
=== joshman is now known as copdle
[05:14] <mglnxx> matthew_: but I wanna drag the contents from that CD to another Burner I've got
[05:14] <matthew_> tx22, I would look at upgrading my RAM before my processor
[05:15] <superchode> strabes: my initial install can only get me to the command line... GUI is down. it didn't install properly.
[05:15] <tx22> VigoFusion:  Well, I dont have that much money.
[05:15] <superchode> i just want to be able to install clean
[05:15] <strabes> hmmmm is your cd broken or something? check the cd for defects
[05:15] <strabes> superchode ^^
[05:15] <superchode> cd is fine
[05:15] <tx22> matthew_:  Yeah, I need more ram.. I have 1gb and it's not enough
[05:15] <superchode> but it has a boot/install option
[05:15] <strabes> superchode: try the alternate cd install
[05:15] <DevC> strabes: installing totem-xine but for some odd reason it is removing totem-gstreamer o_O
[05:15] <strabes> www.ubuntu.com
[05:15] <superchode> so instead of going to install... it boots the bad juju
[05:15] <matthew_> I think you need to use K3b for that...although I really am not too sure if such a thing is possible...I've never done it...
[05:15] <mglnxx> My CD aint broken
[05:16] <superchode> i'm downloading the alternate install cd... what do i do with that to kill the bad install's partition?
[05:16] <VigoFusion> tx22: Then stick with what works, the RAM upgrade was a good suggestion, can your current Mobo handle more RAM?
[05:16] <strabes> superchode: you can't even boot from the regular CD?
[05:16] <kmull> H3g3m0n  you there?
[05:17] <mglnxx> matthew_: there isn't a GTK program to do that? Gnome haven't made one?
[05:17] <strabes> superchode: sorry i have to go
[05:17] <H3g3m0n> kmull: Yeh
[05:17] <superchode> the regular cd boots.... but it's got a boot/install option... i want to install clean, but it boots the borked install
[05:17] <matthew_> superchode, have you tried fiddling w/ your bios?
[05:17] <noodles12> any iaudiophiles in here? i need a recommendation on some earbuds. I kind of want something a little cheaper than seinhesser cs 300's.
[05:17] <kmull> H3g3m0n check pm
[05:17] <tx22> VigoFusion:  Well, this is the trouble.. It's a K8N Neo2 Platinum, but I think the memory slows down if you want more than 2gb
[05:17] <mglnxx> noodles12: check on engadget.com
[05:17] <superchode> nothing wrong with bios or anything... i just need to know how to force the cd to install overtop of the old one
[05:17] <matthew_> try booting a small livecd, such as DSL and cfdisk'ing the "borked" install partition
[05:18] <H3g3m0n> kmull: Havn't gotten anything :/
[05:18] <tx22> VigoFusion:  "Dual-channel DDR works ONLY in the 3 combinations listed in the table shown in the previous page." http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=607
[05:18] <superchode> it's detecting the old install and booting instead of going to the install menu and letting me wipe and re-partition to start fresh
[05:18] <H3g3m0n> kmull: /join #usbboot
[05:18] <superchode> ok, livecd would work
[05:18] <kmull> k
[05:18] <superchode> i had trouble getting root access last time i used it, though
[05:18] <mglnxx> hey anyone here have a program  that can burn directly DVD-to-DVD or/and CD-to-CD? c'mmon I bet I am not the only one
[05:18] <matthew_> superchode, sudo -s
[05:19] <superchode> then 'cfdisk' ?
[05:19] <Gizzle> this is weird, when i open a folder with music files one of song plays briefly for approx. three seconds, does anyone know why?  Using Edgy .. thanks
[05:19] <matthew_> cfdisk /dev/hda1
[05:19] <superchode> k
[05:19] <matthew_> superchode, or whatever partition it is
[05:19] <superchode> i'll give that a go
[05:19] <matthew_> superchode, no no no
[05:19] <superchode> it's hdb1, close enough
[05:19] <matthew_> superchode,  it's hdb
[05:19] <superchode> hdb should work
[05:19] <matthew_> superchode, sudo cfdisk /dev/hdb
[05:20] <superchode> k, hopefully that flushes it
[05:20] <matthew_> superchode, sorry about the mixup
[05:20] <GenNMX> If ps is showing a process taking up CPU time but it's a zombie process, how do I get rid of it? kill -9 isn't doing it.
[05:20] <superchode> no problem, i was following you
[05:20] <mglnxx> anyone here konw any program to burn DVD-to-DVD GKT based?
[05:20] <matthew_> GenNMX, killall name of process
[05:20] <VigoFusion> tx22: Its basic economics, you want a screaming gamer, $$$, you want a functional box, less $, if a box lasts you 5 years, you did good.
[05:20] <matthew_> GenNMX, killall name-of-process
[05:21] <DevC> finally totem-xine worked :)
[05:22] <VigoFusion> Why can't I listen to NPR?
[05:22] <matthew_> superchode, have you got a small liveCD? if not, go to www.damnsmalllinux.org
[05:22] <superchode> i just have breezy & dapper ones
[05:22] <matthew_> DSL will boot very quickly, be snappy, load into RAM,  etc...
[05:22] <superchode> ok.
[05:23] <matthew_> superchode, just a thought
[05:23] <matthew_> superchode, when/if you boot it, type in dsl toram
[05:23] <mglnxx> is this correct apt-get install gnomebaker
[05:24] <tovella> mglnxx: looks correct to me.
[05:24] <marcrosoft> recently my computer started complaining about being read-only then when I rebooted had hd errors.... what could possibly cause this? I ran spinrite and my disk seems fine.
[05:24] <mglnxx> thanks
[05:24] <matthew_> marcrosoft, try fsck'ing the drive
[05:25] <Gizzle>  have a good night folks..
[05:25] <tovella> marcrosoft: all hard drives die, eventually - possible cause.
[05:26] <mglnxx> ROFL@marcrosoft, I once called it macrasoft, but necro$$oft should also be possible
[05:26] <matthew_> sudo fsck /dev/hda
[05:26] <sysrage> why the heck does apt-cache search show stuff completely unrelated to the search term i use?
[05:27] <matthew_> sysrage, try sudo apt-get install synaptic...it's a much easier front-end than the CLI
[05:27] <sysrage> i'll check it out, but i like CLI
[05:27] <bimberi_> sysrage: it searches package descriptions as well
[05:27] <tovella> marcrosoft: i must follow by saying your hard drive may not be dead - it could have simply experience a "hiccup".
[05:27] <sysrage> bimb: any way to only search the name and/or short description?
[05:27] <marcrosoft> tovella, i ran spinrite... i assume it would show if the hd was dying
[05:28] <matthew_> sysrage, in that case, I would say that it's searching in the package name AND description...so if you're looking for a lib, and a package REQUIRES a lib, then that random package will show up...
[05:28] <marcrosoft> mglnxx, yeah i need a new handle I have been using it since middle school
[05:28] <wastrel> sysrage:  apt-cache searches in the package descriptions also so pulls in stuff that is mentioned there
[05:28] <tovella> marcrosoft: if you press "esc" during to boot process, you should be able to get to the boot menu.
[05:28] <AndyLinux> solve my issue grub menu.lst was pointing to wrong partition.
[05:28] <AndyLinux> exit
[05:28] <AndyLinux> quit
[05:28] <wastrel> sysrage:  man apt-cache   use --names-only
[05:28] <sysrage> so i have to grep the results?
[05:28] <sysrage> ahhh thanks wastrel
[05:28] <wastrel> or grep is good too

[05:29] <orestyle8> 512
[05:29] <matthew_> Trex_Boo, it is a one install CD system...
[05:29] <tovella> marcrosoft: from there you should be able to select recovery mode.  from there you can run "fsck".
[05:29] <Trex_Boo> does ubuntu support RPM?
[05:29] <marcrosoft> tovella, ok
[05:30] <marcrosoft> tovella, this has happened before so i dont know what to say

[05:32] <kapput1> what's a third level alt key?
[05:32] <pi1l> can anybody tell me how to move /usr to a new partition: copy /usr to /dev/hdb6, write in /etc/fstab a line "/dev/hdb6       /usr                ext3          defaults,errors=remount-ro    0    1", delete then all /usr(!!!) and reboot, that will do?
[05:32] <orestyle8> matthew: 512
[05:32] <matthew_> hmm, that's very strange...did you md5sum it?
[05:32] <orestyle8> matthew:  its a disk I was using at work for other installs...
[05:33] <matthew_> orestyle8, oh, ok...h/o
[05:33] <orestyle8> matthew:  system was running xp for some time, but now that time is over (I think)
[05:33] <matthew_> orestyle8, maybe it's a faulty cd drive or possibly a bad IDE cable...

[05:42] <||bass> ok, quick question, i installed the WINE package from the installer, i set up some software under wine, is there any way I can make that windows program (under wine) the default handler for a certain file type?
[05:42] <tovella> kapput1: for a fix to enable the "backspace" key to work, check out this site: http://www.meta.net.nz/~daniel/blog/?p=11
[05:42] <H3g3m0n> sko0zy: Settings>repositories in synaptic
[05:42] <MarcC> I can't believe I have to click each one and click remove...?
[05:43] <||bass> it seems so simple
[05:43] <||bass> and yet I havent been able to figure it out
[05:43] <GigaClon> is there a way I can get the list of task to show below the Ubuntu logo on bootup like on Breezy?
[05:43] <||bass> basically
[05:43] <draeath> anyone know if I can make arts NOT lock my alsa device? My alsa device can handle (and does... i've got a working .conf) multiple streams
[05:43] <TheManiacKY> QUestion, do I have to format and reinstall to get 6.10? OR is there some apt-get I can run to upgrade from 6.06.1 to 6.10?
[05:44] <||bass> there's a file type (.usf)
[05:44] <||bass> winamp is the ONLY program that can play it (with a plugin)
[05:44] <mordof> is anyone in the channel #photoshop? if so can i get an invite, heh
[05:44] <wastrel> !upgrade | draeath
[05:44] <ubotu> draeath: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:44] <Squeee> GigaClon: Someone correct me if i'm wrong, be i think the text is already scrolling there, its just black.  Try to find a way to change the color
[05:44] <||bass> so
[05:44] <draeath> wastrel: er?
[05:44] <mordof> ||bass: only program that can play what
[05:44] <FFForever> someone said it is illegal to use netzero on linux is that true?
[05:44] <wastrel> eh wrong nick :] 
[05:44] <||bass> .usf
[05:45] <||bass> it's an audio format
[05:45] <matthew_> bye everyone
[05:45] <Elda> Hello
[05:45] <wastrel> TheManiacKY:   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:45] <TheManiacKY> Thanks wastrel
[05:45] <mordof> ||bass: heh.. i've never even heard of that format
[05:45] <poningru> heeh
[05:45] <||bass> most people havent
[05:45] <GigaClon> FFForever, you would have to check the NetZero ToS
[05:45] <||bass> trust me when I say that the only player in existance for USF files is a winamp plugin
[05:45] <sysrage> ms fonts doesn't seem to make a difference
[05:45] <||bass> hence my problem
[05:46] <H3g3m0n> FFForever: Looks like whatever netzero is actually has a linux version
[05:46] <mordof> ||bass: winamp runs in wine
[05:46] <||bass> i know
[05:46] <||bass> i said that
[05:46] <mordof> i just came in, sorry, heh
[05:46] <Elda> Just making sure, but a good place to start learning is at the wiki right?
[05:46] <FFForever> linspear....
[05:46] <||bass> it's working in wine
[05:46] <Elda> So many resources ;_;
[05:46] <Elda> Relearning again even though I tried it/installed it months ago :s
[05:47] <||bass> i just want to make clicking on .usf files launch winamp (under wine) the same way clicking on .tar files opens up the archiver
[05:47] <||bass> unsurprisingly, this is harder than it seems
[05:47] <mordof> ohhh
[05:47] <poningru> ||bass: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Ultra_64_Sound_Format
[05:48] <tovella> draeath: agreed !upgrade.  do a backup of /boot, /etc, /home, /opt, /usr/local/bin.  Then do a fresh install of 6.10.  I've experienced all sorts of problems doing the upgrade.  Of course it may be 'cause I have all sorts of additional programs installed, some of which are not used in 6.10.  Replaced with different packages.
[05:48] <mordof> could you make a bash script that would run, and recognize it, then plug it into winamp?
[05:48] <MarcC> ||bass: is that a netcast?
[05:48] <||bass> ok
[05:48] <||bass> quick rundown
[05:48] <H3g3m0n> FFForever: I doubt its illegal if they offer a linux version, dunno if it is accessible on Linux's other than Linspire though
[05:48] <dxdt> Anyone in here happen to know why \hbar won't produce anything in Abiword in Ubuntu?
[05:48] <tovella> getting ready for a funeral...  gotta go.
[05:49] <||bass> .usf is literally mips assembly of the audio code from n64 games
[05:49] <||bass> the winamp plugin that plays USF music is a very very very small emulator
[05:49] <mortici> ok can someone help me out
[05:49] <mortici> just installed ubuntu
[05:49] <draeath> tovella, i think you guys are talking to me mistakingly
[05:49] <mordof> mortici: with what
[05:49] <mortici> fresh install, was on gentoo for like 2 years
[05:49] <poningru> hehe
[05:49] <mortici> how do i install xchat-2
[05:49] <poningru> mordof: whatsup?
[05:49] <mortici> and i can't install git
[05:49] <poningru> mordof: make sure you have the extra repositories installed
[05:49] <Elda> Ive just reinstalled ubuntu and I am still lost -_-
[05:50] <poningru> !repositories | mortici
[05:50] <ubotu> mortici: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[05:50] <Pelo> mortici,  have you checked in synaptic for a ready mate package ?
[05:50] <Pelo> ready made
[05:50] <Elda> !ubotu wiki
[05:50] <ubotu> wiki is http://wiki.ubuntu.com - Loads of user-contributed documentation
[05:50] <poningru> !xchat2
[05:50] <poningru> Elda: whats the prob?
[05:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xchat2 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:50] <mortici> Pelo: your talking a weird language to me
[05:50] <mortici> !xchat
[05:50] <poningru> Elda: btw my real name is eldo
[05:50] <Elda> Im just trying to find where to start with this HUGE mass of info :s
[05:50] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6.6-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 275 kB, installed size 760 kB
[05:50] <||bass> ok
[05:51] <||bass> i'm going to guess that this is probably impossible
[05:51] <Elda> Elda taken from the name the character Chii had in chobits :s
[05:51] <Elda> Well, Im new to this basically and still lost -_-
[05:51] <mortici> ok how do i install what ubotu states?
[05:51] <Elda> Im thinking I should start with the first article on wiki?
[05:51] <Pelo> mortici, when you say you can'T install git, what do you mean exactly ?
[05:51] <mortici> i type apt-get install git
[05:51] <mortici> and it fails
[05:51] <poningru> mortici: you have to add the repositories
[05:51] <H3g3m0n> Whats the diffrence between 6.06 and 6.06.1 ?
[05:51] <poningru> follow that link I gave you
[05:51] <mordof> ||bass: nothing is impossible, just some things are REDICULOUSLY hard
[05:51] <mortici> ahhh
[05:51] <mordof> hehe
[05:51] <Pelo> mortici,   menu > system > admin > synaptic package manager
[05:51] <kitche> mortici: sudo apt-get install git but you need the repos enabled
[05:52] <MarcC> ||bass: I don't see why it would be impossible - have you asked at the forums?
[05:52] <xpurple> I'm having issues with my monitor.  It looks fine, but to the right of every solid line there is a ghost.  I've got a crt.  Any ideas?
[05:52] <poningru> H3g3m0n: couple of installer bug fixes, and all the updates
[05:52] <H3g3m0n> ah k
[05:52] <mortici> Pelo, im in Kubuntu
[05:52] <Elda> So is the wiki page a good place to start?
[05:52] <Pelo> mortici,   #kubuntu
[05:52] <mortici> ahh k
[05:53] <MarcC> ||bass: After all, I'm sure a lot of others have tried associating filetypes with Wine apps, no?
[05:53] <craigbass1976> Things are very slow in Ubuntu.  What ails my box?  2.6 ghz processor, asus mb, 512 ram...
[05:53] <Elda> Slow?
[05:53] <Elda> Things are running fast for me :S
[05:53] <wastrel> Elda:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
[05:53] <mister_roboto> xpurple, do you have a kvm switch, or a digital out on your video card going to your crt?
[05:53] <craigbass1976> Switching between windows
[05:53] <MarcC> craigbass1976: what's slow?
[05:53] <Xenguy> craigbass1976: there should be no slow
[05:53] <Pelo> craigbass1976,   check the system monitor and see what is eating up your mem or cpu
[05:53] <craigbass1976> Dragging windows leaves trails
[05:53] <xpurple> mister_roboto: Not at all.  It's direct to the video card.
[05:53] <fnf> craigbass1976: Do you mean 'visually' slow or essensially slow in speed ?
[05:53] <Elda> And Im on a 3ghz laptop with 512 ram for the system and 128 to the video card with igp345m hehe
[05:54] <craigbass1976> top says nothing out of the ordinary
[05:54] <Elda> okey, ty wastrel
[05:54] <Elda> :)
[05:54] <ma12> Hi everyone, How can I tell what charset my Ubuntu installation is using?
[05:54] <Elda> Dragging is super fast in mine :s
[05:54] <wastrel> craigbass1976:  you're using beryl/xgl?
[05:54] <craigbass1976> fnf, I guess visually slow
[05:54] <xpurple> mister_roboto: It's also a normal video card.  No DVI conversion.
[05:54] <craigbass1976> 6.06, and I'm new to ubuntu
[05:54] <craigbass1976> so I dont knwo what beryl is
[05:55] <fnf> craigbass1976: Did you install the necessary 3D driver, under Linux: there're around four supported graphic branch
[05:55] <mister_roboto> xpurple: i've seen that effect in the 2 situations i described but other than that, no idea what would cause it.  sorry :)
[05:55] <xpurple> mister_roboto: Thanks, I'll keep looking.
[05:55] <Elda> So let me make sure /home is like the folder where all the user "profiles" are stored correct? :s
[05:55] <kapput1> this is a slightly dumb question. But when we install apps by hand (compiling from source etc) what's the standard place for extracting the files?
[05:56] <Elda> Just reading
[05:56] <quik_> hey folks
[05:56] <ma12> How do I know what the encoding of my system is?
[05:56] <craigbass1976> fnf, I have no idea what I'd need, I didn't install any extra drivers.  Edgy ran fine on this box two days ago; would that have installed this driver for me, where dapper wouldn't have?
[05:56] <Xenguy> kapput1: there are many alternatives to compiling by hand...
[05:56] <wastrel> Elda:  /home is where the user home folders are kept.
[05:56] <Xenguy> kapput1: but if you must, perhaps /usr/local/src
[05:56] <quik_> I'm looking into ubuntu and gentoo, what are some of the clear advantages in ubuntu?
[05:56] <Elda> okey
[05:56] <wastrel> Elda:  like /home/elda  for you if your user name is elda
[05:56] <kapput1> Xenguy: thanks
[05:56] <fnf> craigbass1976: By default Ubuntu configures X server to use vesa driver, try 'cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver' to see what is your current driver.
[05:56] <mister_roboto> kapput1: it's not a dumb question :)  i like /usr/local since it isn't touched by os upgrades
[05:57] <Elda> right so thats where all the user profiles type things are
[05:57] <Elda> Sorry about my comparisons to window, but its the only thing I know ;s
[05:57] <azion> Hey all, can anyone tell me how I can edit my "/etc/fstab"
[05:57] <Elda> okey well that makes sense hehe
[05:57] <GigaClon> quik_, ubuntu is easy to set up and use and, gentoo is for power users,
[05:57] <Xenguy> kapput1: yw - checkinstall is worth a look too
[05:57] <craigbass1976> fnf, yeah, vesa
[05:57] <wastrel> i don't know how user profiles are managed in windows.  the home directory is the default location for all of the user's files
[05:57] <GigaClon> if this is your first Linux use ubuntu
[05:57] <fnf> craigbass1976: What is your graphic card ?
[05:58] <||bass> i got it
[05:58] <kapput1> checkinstall?
[05:58] <Elda> ah, like desktops/files etc?
[05:58] <quik_> GigaClon: debian is my first linux
[05:58] <Elda> For each person
[05:58] <||bass> you set the file handler to be a little shell script
[05:58] <craigbass1976> fnf, Ummmm lemme get the box.  It's whatever came on the asus mb
[05:58] <wastrel> azion:  why do you want to edit your /etc/fstab
[05:58] <Elda> bleh ILl stop bothering you and look for myself xD
[05:58] <Elda> sorry for the trouble :s
[05:58] <||bass> and just put "wine "C:\program files\winamp\winamp.exe" winepath -w "$1""
[05:58] <||bass> as the script
[05:58] <Xenguy> kapput1: produces deb packages from source - easier to uninstall (and reinstall on other machines)
[05:58] <sko0zy> whats a good evirment to start learning python in..?
[05:58] <azion> wastrel: To setup file shares
[05:58] <wastrel> Elda:  all files, the user's desktop, all configuration files and browser cache, etc.  goes in the home directory
[05:58] <Elda> ah okey, then it is like that
[05:58] <Elda> ty :)
[05:59] <fnf> craigbass1976: Go on, if it's either nvidia, ATI, Matrox or Intel integrated then there's a chance to improve.
[05:59] <GigaClon> quik_, ubuntu is derived from debian, so it would be a logical choice
[05:59] <quik_> GigaClon: Its for a production level web server, x86
[05:59] <fnf> craigbass1976: You may try 'lspci' as an alternative, it's not necessary to open the box.
[05:59] <wastrel> azion:  /etc/fstab  is a text file owned by root,  you need to use sudo to edit it in a text editor.
[05:59] <corevette> how do you change the default media player for lets say...dvds
[05:59] <ma12> I am following the "how to install photoshop guide" and it says I must figure out what the encoding of my system is... how can I figure that out?
[05:59] <wastrel> azion:  make a backup of the working copy before you edit it.
[05:59] <quik_> the reason gentoo is on the table is use flags / portage
[06:00] <azion> wastrel: So do I do "sudo edit /etc/fstab"
[06:00] <craigbass1976> fnf, no, I meant the box the mb came in.  I just loked through the manual, but it said nothing.  lspci it is...
[06:00] <carl_1> hey all

[06:01] <carl_1> can somone help me getting my radeon card (old RAGE mobile in a laptop
[06:01] <wastrel> azion:  gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[06:01] <carl_1> Its really scrweed up, the right side of my screen is duplicated and theres artifacts in various places (long thick lines)
[06:01] <fnf> craigbass1976: I have no idea about this one, let me search for a minute to see if it's 3D supported.

[06:03] <Pelo> lifepositive, probably flash
[06:03] <ma12> Is the encoding of my ubuntu 6.10 ascii?
[06:04] <Pelo> !flash9 | lifepositive
[06:04] <ubotu> lifepositive: You can download a Flash 9 installer here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/backports/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy).  If you use GDebi to install it, make sure you open its terminal window (to answer an installer question).
[06:04] <ma12> I need to change the encoding of a windows registry file to a file I can import into wine
[06:04] <fnf> craigbass1976: Almost new models are 3D cards, the thing is, currently the 3D driver for rare cards is a bit lack.
[06:04] <lifepositive> Pelo: they arent flash
[06:04] <lifepositive> Pelo: I can play flash files

[06:05] <Elda> how exactly can files be "lost" so that I would find them in the lost and found? lol
[06:05] <fnf> craigbass1976: The result came from: "Linux" "X" "SiS" "3D". Try digging 'em further, that's quite easy to install the driver I supposed.
[06:06] <lifepositive> Pelo: FF addon for active X?
[06:06] <ma12> What is the charset on ubuntu 6.10?
[06:06] <sko0zy> wastrel, well i realy new to coding in general
[06:06] <lifepositive> Pelo: there is an activex addon for Firefox?
[06:06] <wastrel> Elda:  lost+found is where files that are recovered after a system crash are placed
[06:06] <ArrenLex> lifepositive: for Windows, yes. Linux, no.
[06:06] <dubois> hello
[06:06] <wastrel> Elda:  they are usually corrput so they're placed there instead of back there they were originally

[06:07] <dubois> i need help
[06:07] <Pelo> lifepositive,  that site is telling me I need  mozilla active X plugin
[06:07] <ArrenLex> wastrel: technically, lost+found are where files which were orphaned by the filesystem are placed.

[06:14] <ArrenLex> Flighter: Oh.
[06:14] <ma12> does anyone know how I can findout what charset I am using?

[06:15] <Flighter> ma12: type locale
[06:15] <ma12> thanks
[06:15] <wastrel> it is not generally possible to use windows drivers with ubuntu.  some wifi drivers are the exceptions.
[06:15] <Flighter> ArrenLex: what  you run
[06:15] <ArrenLex> Flighter: debian.
[06:15] <noodles12> with ndiswrapper for some wifi drivers

[06:15] <thepensu> how difficult is it to shrink ext3 partitions? I'm seeing mixed results on google, but so far it sounds lke i'ts only possible to expand ext3, not shrink, using parted
[06:16] <ArrenLex> Flighter: why don't you just reinstall the package if your theme has become corrupt?

[06:18] <rakeno> anyone know why my computer reboot endlessly when i installed Dapper and Edgy but breezy?
[06:18] <elriah> In my "minutes" column?  Just put "5/*" without the quotes?
[06:18] <Flighter> ArrenLex: your a one
[06:18] <thepensu> yah... do a man -a crontab if that doesn't work, I might have the syntax wrong
[06:18] <Madpilot> Flighter, be polite, or leave.
[06:18] <thepensu> but if I do, it'll complain when you edit the crontab anyway
[06:19] <elriah> Cool, thanks!!!
[06:19] <Flighter> better leave, this way i dont have to get this crappy guys
[06:20] <st3v3dnd> Another worked in dapper, not in edgy issue. Before I upgraded, I had wmv files that would play fine. After the upgrade totem won't play the wmv files saying "Video codec 'MS WMV 8 (win32)' is not handled" It was handled fine under dapper. Do I need to change where codecs are found or some such?

[06:25] <phen> ivtv Linux kernel module (0.6 branch)
[06:25] <phen> The primary goal of the IvyTV Project is to create a kernel driver for the iTVC15 familiy of MPEG codecs. The iTVC15 family includes the iTVC15 (CX24315) and iTVC16 (CX24316). These chips are commonly found on Hauppauge's WinTV PVR-250 and PVR-350 TV capture cards.
[06:25] <phen> This package contains the ivtv loadable kernel modules for the kernel-image-2.6.17-10-generic package.
[06:25] <phen> If you compiled a custom kernel, you will most likely need to compile a custom version of this module as well. The ivtv-source package has been provided for this purpose.

[06:33] <superchode|fu> my windows partition is on hda - which is sda... ubuntu is sdb, which i guess would translate to hdb (it's the second disk)
[06:33] <superchode|fu> i need to verify which drive is which, the cfdisk the one with my bad ubuntu install on it
[06:33] <holycow> sudo fdisk -l
[06:34] <cafuego_> superchode|fu: So you have 2 harddisks?

[06:35] <pwner> hello..trying to run win xp on vmware player but im not sure how to get it to recognize my windows disk
[06:35] <cafuego_> superchode|fu: Linux will be /dev/sdb, as Windows cna only run off sda.  Double check with 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb'
[06:35] <craigbass1976> If I wanted to do the regular su - to run commands, would I somehow disable sudoing for my regular account and give root a password?
[06:36] <cafuego_> craigbass1976: 'alias su' = sudo -s'
[06:36] <TGPO> craigbass1976 no need to disable sudo
[06:36] <cafuego_> craigbass1976: disabling sudo is pointless, but you could set a root password. 'sudo passwd'
[06:36] <TGPO> craigbass1976 sudu su
[06:36] <cafuego_> TGPO: sudo su?
[06:36] <holycow> pwner, vmware player can ONLY play vmware images.  you need vmware server or vmware workstation to install win on vmware and create the vmware appliance/image
[06:36] <craigbass1976> I don't like being able to do things in the gui as me; asking for the root password is a reminder that I could screw the whole box up
[06:37] <weebit> thank you TGPO
[06:37] <craigbass1976> Or does it only ask for my password in those instances anyway?
[06:37] <superchode|fu> k, what does fdisk -l do? i'm a bit paranoid about damaging my windows partition
[06:37] <cafuego_> craigbass1976: You can edit the sudoers file to ALWAYS ask for a password quite easily
[06:37] <TGPO> cafuego_ how to use sudo to log into root so you dont have to keep typing sudo all the flippin time
[06:37] <dsnyders> superchode|fu, it lists the partitions
[06:37] <holycow> man fdisk
[06:37] <cafuego_> superchode|fu: it prints the aprtition info, does not modify anything
[06:38] <cafuego_> TGPO: sudo -s
[06:38] <weebit> page wont load keeps timing out on me
[06:38] <weebit> is this a busy time for it?
[06:38] <TGPO> cafuego_ a matter of taste
[06:38] <superchode|fu> k, sda is definately my window partition... sdb is ubuntu
[06:38] <cafuego_> TGPO: spawns less shells, thus faster
[06:38] <superchode|fu> how do i wipe out sdb so i can install clean?
[06:39] <ma12> Flighter: Hi, thanks for the charset tip... do you know how I can find out what charset my windows box uses?
[06:39] <cafuego_> craigbass1976: you cna even make sudo ask for the root password as opposed to the suer's password :-)
[06:40] <adele> how do I run gnome font control panel from KDE?
[06:40] <superchode|fu> should 'sudo cfdisk /dev/hdb' take care of it?
[06:41] <dope> how do i shutdown X server?
[06:41] <cafuego_> craigbass1976: If you add 'timestamp_timeout=0' in the default options, sudo will ALWAYS prompt for the password and not remember you for 15 minutes
[06:41] <dsnyders> superchode|fu, sudo fdisk /dev/sdb, delete all the partitions and reboot with the installation CD in the drive.

[06:51] <Xenguy> dsnyders: not sure actually, just an idea
[06:51] <craigbass1976> bclough, unrelated, but how is the transition going?  I'm in the middle of one myself
[06:51] <dsnyders> Xenguy, thanks.  I'll look into it.
[06:51] <crys> budluva: do you want to revert back to the ati driver or a previous fglrx?
[06:51] <craigbass1976> bclough, from Fedora I mean
[06:51] <Xenguy> bclough: use aptitude or apt-get or synatpic -- yum is crap
[06:51] <Xenguy> by comparison
[06:51] <bclough> craigbass1976: hey, i actually really like Ubuntu thus far...less fighting with things to work especially plugins!
[06:52] <bclough> Xenguy: yes, i have been using apt-get, but do you know where to get more repositories?
[06:52] <Xenguy> bclough: you just need to configure a suitable mirrir
[06:52] <budluva> crys, what options do i have?
[06:52] <craigbass1976> bclough, I'm finding sudoing kind of weird, and type commands that don't work in Ubuntu, but I think I like it too.
[06:52] <Xenguy> mirror
[06:53] <budluva> crys, ati.com's and ubuntu's synaptic driver?
[06:53] <bclough> craigbass1976: yeah, the sudo thing is kinda strange...but i think good security wise
[06:53] <Xenguy> bclough: google ubuntu mirror
[06:53] <bclough> Xenguy: thanks for the suggestion :)
[06:53] <bclough> Xenguy: what file are these repositories stored in...do you know?
[06:54] <Xenguy> bclough: /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:54] <craigbass1976> bclough, sounds like six of one, half dozen of the other to me after listening to folks in both camps; I'll just get used to it

[06:56] <bclough> arctu: have you got it to work?
[06:57] <arctu> yep..
[06:57] <crys> budluva: do you want 3D acceleration?  If so then you need to use the "fglrx" driver *instead* of "ati" driver
[06:57] <budluva> crys ok thanks
[06:57] <budluva> crys so for games use ubuntus and not ati.com's?
[06:57] <bclough> arctu can you point me in the right direction to get it working...its been my dream!!!  I have seen demos of it!
[06:58] <XiXaQ> bclough, I don't understand.. What happened?
[06:58] <dsnyders> Xenguy, tct==The coroner's toolkit?
[06:58] <arctu> let me see.. hmm. u got what gfx card?
[06:58] <Xenguy> dsnyders: yep
[06:58] <dsnyders> cool thx
=== infest_ is now known as yaso
[06:58] <crys> budluva: you have them backwards in your last statment - use ati's for 3d, ubuntu for stability (i.e.  hibernation, etc)
[06:58] <XiXaQ> arctu, Ubuntu doesn't use XGL, I think. It uses AIGLX instead.
[06:58] <Xenguy> dsnyders: intended for a slightly different audience perhaps?
[06:59] <arctu> XiXaQ, yep..
[06:59] <arctu> if im not mistaken too
[06:59] <bclough> XiXaQ: you were asking about a restore solution...i don't know of any for Ubuntu for I am new...but was thinking maybe it is something that can be fixed
[06:59] <arctu> it uses XGL last time though
[06:59] <budluva> crys, well ati.com's is fubard for me
[06:59] <arctu> XGL+compiz
[06:59] <dsnyders> Xenguy, e2retreive sounded ideal, however it just gave me three files that didn't mean anything to me.

[07:01] <bclough> its a radeon mobile....
[07:01] <bclough> donno if it will even have the power to do these kind of things...
[07:01] <budluva> crys, fglrxinfo is showing mesa
[07:01] <arctu> it should..
[07:01] <budluva> hrmm i musta screwed something up
[07:01] <budluva> it was showing ati earlier
[07:02] <bclough> anyhow its ATI
[07:02] <crys> budluva: you aren't using ati's fglrx driver then...something happened
[07:02] <XiXaQ> bclough, I think rsync is used for it, but I'm not sure if it keeps old backups.

[07:05] <georgy> Raskall,
[07:05] <Flannel> Rav|strangler: sudo apt-get remove --purge proftpd

[07:05] <Pie-rate> My laptop wifi isn't working. Please do not respond with "!wifi." I have drivers and networkmanager, but when I try to connect to "PMTech AP1", it spends awhile saying its trying to join pmtech ap1 and then says no connection. it has low signal (the AP is about 1/4th a mile away with a directional antenna) but definitely works in windows. I have not yet tried a closer AP but i need this one to work.
[07:05] <budluva> crys, it display's Driver     "fglrx"
[07:06] <matthew_> Rav|strangler, try sudo apt-get remove proftpd
[07:06] <matthew_> whoops, too late
[07:06] <bclough> Can someone tell me how to probe hardware...such as video card etc.
[07:07] <bclough> Just to get information about it...any hardware that is...

[07:08] <Pie-rate> its an unsecured AP
[07:09] <budluva> crys, thats with ati.com's driver
[07:09] <budluva> crys, so should i try to reinstall ati.com's driver or apt-get xorg-driver-fglrx?

[07:10] <Rav|strangler> Pie-rate, what does iwconfig give you
[07:11] <crys> budluva: I didn't ask a yes or no question - I asked for a version of the driver you have downloaded
[07:11] <budluva> oh hehe
[07:11] <budluva> ati-driver-installer-8.29.6.run

[07:12] <brad123> bclough: where do i get the vlc plugin for firefox?
[07:12] <crys> budluva: ok - that one will work, the question is what process did you use to install it
[07:13] <andy__> does ubuntu have lists of current packages available on the web somewhere?

[07:18] <LinuxHelp> Hi, when I boot from my Ubuntu 6.10 Server x86_64 install cd I can use the initial menu where it says "Install Ubuntu" "Check cd for defects" etc. But a problem arises in that as soon as I press enter install, the setup loads but my keyboard no longer works at all. I assume this is because the default (text-mode) install doesnt load a usb keyboard driver? How can I load one perhaps using kernel parameters?
[07:18] <bclough> brad123: what do you use to manage package installations...do you handle it through the gui?

[07:20] <mortici> how do i change my screen resolution?
[07:20] <brad123> bclough: aptitude, after i read something comparing aptitude and apt-get, but you can get it through synaptic too. it might be in the universe/mulitverse repos or backports
[07:20] <Pie-rate> Timthelion: the solution is obvious, and it involves an ubuntu install disc and your windows box.
[07:20] <Pie-rate> :)
[07:21] <hajiki> hey guys when i click on the update tray icon instead of opening the update manager it opens the synaptic package manager.... OMG can you help me plz??

[07:22] <Rav|strangler> Pie-rate, have you disconnected all the internet ports?

[07:26] <Pie-rate> there's wireless connection (this network interface is not configured) and Wired connection (address: DHCP)
[07:26] <crys> Vich: because you were asking about io.h...not exactly a standard C library (or C++) so I thought maybe the code you where compiling might give clues to what io.h was...

[07:29] <Rav|strangler> but if you know you don't you should be fine.
[07:29] <Pie-rate> yep phone is 900mhz

[07:31] <Berto2112> which kernel should I be running with Dual P4 Xeons?
[07:31] <tx22> I really think we should get some developers to write the utility to install ubuntu without having to partition the HD etc!
[07:31] <Madpilot> tx22, you can, but it's better w/ partitions
[07:32] <crys> tx22: what Madpilot said
[07:32] <Pie-rate> the wired connection here is provided by a bridge that has a directional antenna on it, the AP connects to the T1 router has a corresponding antenna and laptops generally work over here
[07:32] <tx22> Madpilot:  Really, where is this utility?
[07:32] <Pie-rate> albeit just barely
=== hajiki is now known as Archer
[07:32] <Madpilot> tx22, go thru the install & tell it to use one partition for everything, and AFAIK it will, you'll just have to tell it to
[07:32] <Pie-rate> the bridge with the antenna has 90-99% signal strength though
[07:32] <Madpilot> by default, it tries to create /, /home & /swap
[07:33] <tx22> Madpilot:  No, I'm talking about ubuntu running in the windows enviroment, because people want to try ubuntu without having the burn the ISO
[07:33] <Duckman0> use a VM
[07:33] <Madpilot> tx22, then run the LiveCD. Dual-booting is *always* going to require partitioning
[07:33] <Madpilot> or use a VM, like Duckman0 said
[07:34] <VigoFusion> tx22: a live java virtual ubuntu?
[07:34] <Weebit> and to keep windows on one partition you do what to install ubuntu?

[07:40] <VigoFusion> tx22: That could work, But then it would be a Windows Program, and once installed, Microsoft would own it. The User could play with it, but I dont think the Core Devs would agree to a Win Installar, the Dual Boot is painless enough.

[07:44] <tx22> Brilliant ideas are discussed in the forum, but rarely do I see them actually coming to light, and it's sad to see it old topics just get discarded and buried within the old topics
[07:44] <Madpilot> tx22, best place to contact the devs is thru their mailing list - lists.ubuntu.com - look for ubuntu-devel - most of them are not forum users
[07:44] <JoePits> oh ya it is an old laptop
[07:44] <JoePits> its always the same packages tho every time it ry
[07:44] <JoePits> some work
[07:44] <Madpilot> tx22, to be honest, the real work of Ubuntu goes on on mailing lists and to a lesser extent IRC. The forums barely enter into it.
[07:45] <bitflip> that's because forums and irc are timesinks!

[07:45] <JoePits> its probably the drive you're right.  because i took this laptop out of the closet and xp wouldnt boot up either
[07:45] <Madpilot> mortici, there's no need to do that - use sudo & your own pw
[07:46] <P-Smurf> Well im bringing up a point thats been raised on a few forums official and non, why doesnt my popular video card work? I cant even boot with it set as primary display, then i cant utilize it as a secondary even though the os recognizes it in lspci

[07:46] <LewyJH> i've set up my network, and everything, and activated eth1 its just not reciving a signal.
[07:46] <mortici> and they require admin mode...
[07:46] <budluva> bah
[07:46] <Madpilot> mortici, anything needing admin should ask you for a password - use your own user pw
[07:46] <budluva> can someone tell me what crys just said to me?
[07:47] <P-Smurf> LewyJH: deactivate your cards then reactivate them, happens to me after an install
[07:47] <dsnyders> mortici, sudo provides you with admin access for a single command.
[07:47] <bitflip> budluva: what game?  Sometimes you have to configure them to use an accelerated driver, i.e. like quake*, ut, etc
[07:47] <budluva> it was regarding my ati driver install

[07:50] <budluva> well ya
[07:50] <budluva> didnt you want to create a file?
[07:51] <mordof> yeah...
[07:51] <bitflip> budluva: I see that uses the quake2 engine - you have to tell it to use a specific driver if I had to guess
[07:51] <budluva> will touch myfilename not create a file called myfilename?
[07:51] <_tcc> anyone?
[07:51] <_tcc> syslinux?
[07:51] <budluva> bitflip, installing et now
[07:51] <dsnyders> budluva, yes, if filename does not exist.  If it does exist, it changes the timestamp on the file.
[07:51] <battousaix19> LewyJH, are u using ndiswrapper or are u using a kernel module?
[07:52] <mordof> budluva: oh, i didn't know it would create if it didn't exist
[07:52] <budluva> dsnyders, ok well he wanted to know how to create a file, besides nano filename then thats the only way i know :P
[07:52] <CharlieSu> testing apache conf. please tell me if yall see http://charlie.phunki.com
[07:52] <LewyJH> battousaix19: Kernal module i think...i go to system>admin>network
[07:53] <JoePits> <P-Smurf> sounds like the drive Joe ----did you mean the HD or CD-ROM
[07:53] <dsnyders> budluva, sorry,  I thought you was he.
[07:53] <P-Smurf> VigoFusion: Motherboard is a P4i65gv with an onboard Intel Video
[07:53] <P-Smurf> JoePits: cd-rom
[07:53] <JoePits> ohh
[07:53] <JoePits> maybe the lens is dirty...thats why it keeps messing up at the same spot?
[07:53] <P-Smurf> JoePits: its a burner too?
[07:54] <dsnyders> budluva, I like giving a little more information to people than the standard "here is the command"
[07:54] <P-Smurf> JoePits: or are you burning it on another machine?
[07:54] <JoePits> no this is an old amd k7 laptop 300 mhz
[07:54] <crazy_bus> Does anyone know of a good program to download a streaming .rm file?
[07:54] <JoePits> im using the "alternative" ubuntu
[07:54] <JoePits> no burner
[07:54] <P-Smurf> JoePits: i know it sounds weird, but find a completely dif machine to burn it on
[07:54] <budluva> dsnyders, ok sorry, i just get to the nitty gritty :P
[07:54] <JoePits> ok after this time fails again ill try that
[07:55] <JoePits> i mean i tried both nero and magic iso
[07:55] <JoePits> and updated my firmware
[07:55] <budluva> bitflip, enemy territory seems to work ok, must be that game
[07:55] <_tcc> where is mcopy?
[07:55] <VigoFusion> P_Smurf:  I have the ATI Onboard X 200 series, all the binary drivers in the world didnt help, but the commend did.
[07:55] <P-Smurf> if you make multiple copies and it keeps screwing up in the same spot, try an isolate
[07:55] <budluva> bitflip, that paintball game works fine on my nvidia fx 5500 :P
[07:55] <P-Smurf> VigoFusion: commend?
[07:55] <bitflip> budluva: paintball 2 uses a quake2 engine, correct?
[07:55] <budluva> bitflip, ya i think so
[07:55] <_tcc> anyone?
[07:55] <_tcc> MCOPY?
[07:55] <P-Smurf> JoePits: thats using the same pc and drive to burn it though
[07:55] <VigoFusion> command
[07:55] <JoePits> psmurf im doing the partioning manually this time and trying ext2 to see if its the hard drive
[07:56] <bitflip> budluva: you have to give some crazy opt's like +set vid_ref glx +set gl_driver libGL.so
[07:56] <Geoffrey2> ok, let's try this one, then...any ideas why Ubuntu would insist my internal wireless 802.11g is a wired network connection?  and could this pose a problem?
[07:56] <budluva> wow :P
[07:56] <P-Smurf> VigoFusion: whats the command?
[07:56] <JoePits> since its an old machine ext3 i heard is not good for it
[07:56] <VigoFusion> I ran the fglrx, and whammo, slammo, everything got BIG!

[07:57] <zing> anybody running ubuntu powerpc on a powerbook 2400?
[07:57] <VigoFusion> That thread is kinda ATI specific, but take a gander and see if it lends some insight.
[07:58] <bitflip> budluva: bitflip <-> crys - anyhow, you might search their forums with those particular references and see if something turns up for linux usage
[07:58] <P-Smurf> VigoFusion: thanks, ill look it over
[07:58] <LinuxHelp> JoePits, why would ext3 be "not good" for a machine?
[07:58] <P-Smurf> ive been literally working on it all day long
[07:59] <budluva> bitflip, ya
[07:59] <macd> Ext3 is fine
[07:59] <budluva> bit et works, so tce will work so im happy :P
[08:00] <VigoFusion> I am not certain it will work for you, but I prefer to see things working.
[08:01] <Archer> hey guys when i click on the update tray icon instead of opening the update manager it opens the synaptic package manager....  can you help me plz??
[08:01] <P-Smurf> VigoFusion: there is a problem with that though, if my vid card is set up to boot, I wont even make it to the login screen
[08:01] <battousaix19> LinuxHelp, ext3 only has bad performance compared to others, but quite reliable
[08:01] <tyerldaf> would you guys recommended ubuntu, or gentoo?
[08:02] <Tarkus> pooooooooooooooop
[08:02] <tyerldaf> I mean whats the difference
[08:02] <bitflip> tyerldaf: slackware, duh...
[08:02] <CharlieSu> tyerldaf: gentoo if you want new packages.. ubuntu if you want a binary distro
[08:02] <Madpilot> tyerldaf, you're in #ubuntu - guess which we'd recommend...
[08:02] <CharlieSu> Madpilot: i use both
[08:02] <tyerldaf> charliesui: what do you mean new packages?
[08:02] <tyerldaf> and binary distro?
[08:02] <tyerldaf> I know what binary is but distro
[08:03] <max_> is there any other things that you could do that are like the "eyecandy" besides XGL(cant run it) Transluncey and 3ddesktop
[08:03] <DarkMageZ> tyerldaf, with gentoo, you compile almost EVERYTHING from source
[08:03] <Madpilot> a distro is a version of linux - ubuntu is a distro, so is gentoo
[08:03] <kaptengu> does anybody have anything to say about Xandros?
[08:03] <rastilin> You mean good things?
[08:03] <NeonLevel> is it any good to choose the alternate iso image?
[08:03] <rastilin> If you want to, it works perfectly.
[08:04] <NeonLevel> why would someone choose the alternate iso image?
[08:04] <Madpilot> NeonLevel, the alternate is just the installer, no LiveCD stuff, if that's why you want
[08:04] <battousaix19> versions are a bad way to say it, they are just different syetems that have different and conflicting philosophies, so their "flavours"
[08:04] <YoG> hi, can someone help me setup wep for ra0?
[08:04] <rastilin> Because they wanted to install a RAID system or on a computer with less than 192MB of RAM.
[08:04] <Madpilot> it's good for installing on low-RAM machines, or for specific, more complex installation
[08:04] <JoePits> im using alternative, trying to install it, on this 96MB ram laptop
[08:04] <Pie-rate> lol, my laptop just locked up entirely, the bug reporter popped up and said gnome-panel crashed, and i told it to close and another bug reporter popped up and then it locked up entirely
[08:05] <NeonLevel> thanks Madpilot, thanks for the explanation
[08:05] <tyerldaf> okay for me being new to linux, I should probaly download ubuntu then?
[08:05] <LewyJH> pie-rate: that happened to me, i rebooted and it worked fine...then i installed.
[08:05] <Tarkus> snagle puss
[08:05] <Tarkus> ta ta
[08:06] <doubletwist> Anyone here highly knowledgeable with mdadm?
[08:06] <Pie-rate> i know the popular opinion is that linux has more stability going for it, but this definitely did not fail gracefully, windows at LEAST gives a bluescreen with a message on it that's somewhat useful for debugging.
[08:06] <Pie-rate> LewyJH: then you installed what?
[08:07] <LewyJH> ubuntu
[08:07] <Pie-rate> it already has ubuntu on it
[08:07] <P-Smurf> tyerldaf: yea, if your new get ubuntu
[08:07] <LewyJH> pie-rate: did you install already/
[08:07] <kaptengu> is Ubuntu Christian Edition a joke?
[08:07] <doubletwist> I had a system die, so I've moved the raid5 array to another machine, and I can't get it to recognize the array, even though it does recognize that each drive is a device in an array...
[08:07] <LewyJH> pie-rate: did you try to open  aprogram or did it just crahs out of the blue?
[08:07] <tyerldaf> p-smurf: okay I'm redownloading the ubuntu, cause the last copy was saying I had a corrupt file
[08:07] <tyerldaf> or bad checksum
[08:08] <Pie-rate> just crashed, it might have had something to do with the network manager since that was the last thing i screwed with
[08:08] <P-Smurf> tylerdaf: do you have an older pc? xubutu i tihnk works waaaayy better
[08:08] <Pie-rate> maybe i should change to kde or e17...
[08:08] <JoePits> <tyerldaf> mine keeps saying that too
[08:08] <Pie-rate> !e17
[08:08] <ubotu> Enlightenment (or "E") is a window manager for X, providing a useful, and good looking graphical shell in which to work. E17 is the current development version.
[08:08] <battousaix19> lol, no ubuntu CE is just covering a missed and often ignored minority
[08:08] <VigoFusion> This distro is one of the smoothest slides from Windows, Knoppix and Xandros and about a hunnerd others were also. But I have found Ubuntu to be the best so far, by far.
[08:09] <rastilin> Christians are like 70% of the western world, ignored?
[08:09] <_0mk4r_> hi, which swr can give me a monthy report of data transfer over eth0?
[08:09] <LewyJH> pie-rate: mine crahsed when i opened network manager, but thats the only time it happened. and it happened because it wasn't fully booted up.
[08:09] <Pie-rate> christians are lemmings and should be ignored?
[08:09] <P-Smurf> JoePits: get xubuntu, more streamlined and runs better, X system runs better
[08:10] <tyerldaf> p-smurf: its a gateway 1.3 gig intel celron, so yea its kind of a older system
[08:10] <rastilin> X system is lighter weight, I don't know about "better".
[08:10] <Madpilot> Pie-rate, be polite
[08:10] <_0mk4r_> like logging daily bandwidth used, hourly and monthly too
[08:10] <Duckman0> has anyone here added a second hard drive by mounting it?
[08:10] <kaptengu> I though Ubuntu CE was the answer to Windows CE :P
[08:10] <rastilin> Ouch
[08:11] <YoG> hi, can someone help me setup wep for ra0?
[08:11] <Pie-rate> Madpilot: I'm sorry, but no. I do not respect anyone that believes in a 2000 year old work of fiction.
[08:11] <tyerldaf> joepits: did you try to redownload it, and burn it again?
[08:11] <tyerldaf> p-smurf: so you say try the other version instead?
[08:11] <defrysk> Pie-rate, you are off topic in a useless discussion
[08:11] <JoePits> im doing that now sending it to my other computer with a burner
[08:11] <defrysk> so please stop
[08:11] <Duckman0> how do I add my second hard drive?
[08:12] <JoePits> its liike the cdrom just stops spinning or something
[08:12] <rastilin> defrysk, because this is a center for erudite conversation. If you meet in a public forum, you have to deal with sidelined discussions.
[08:12] <_0mk4r_> please guide me on bandwidth usage monitor swr...

[08:15] <gl1tch> i would like to ask what is the difference btw Ubuntu 6.10, the Newest Ubuntu Release and Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, Ubuntu with Long Term Support
[08:15] <YoG> bitflip: how can i tell?
[08:15] <Amaranth> max_: What video card do you have?
[08:16] <max_> Intel i810
[08:16] <rastilin> gl1tch, you mean aside from the extended support?
[08:16] <LewyJH> i'm sorry...
[08:16] <Amaranth> max_: edgy?
[08:16] <huibert> gl1tch:if you are interseeted in a long runnnig stable (as in running the same apps) system, take dapper
[08:16] <LewyJH> i didn't know what it did.
[08:16] <DBO> LewyJH, just dont do it again unless an op is really needed
[08:16] <Madpilot> LewyJH, you'd just seen what it did. Next time will result in a ban...
[08:17] <bitflip> YoG: RaLink has some updated drivers on their homepage
[08:17] <huibert> gl1tch: if you want bleeding edgy, new eye candy, and the latest and greatest, and want to upgrade to the latest and greatest in 18 months, take edgy
[08:17] <LewyJH> madpilot: yeah i get it...
[08:17] <bitflip> YoG: can you open up a term and type this:  lspci | grep RaLink
[08:17] <Geoffrey2> gl1tch, well, Edgy has a more recent version of Gnome, and uses a more recent kernel than Dapper shipped with by default
[08:17] <YoG> bitflip, just a sec.
[08:18] <LewyJH> can anyone help me with my wireless connection to my router?
[08:18] <YoG> bitflip, it doesn't say anything about the version...
[08:18] <gl1tch> edgy whooo i am lost
[08:18] <Pie-rate> !ask|LewyJH
[08:18] <ubotu> LewyJH: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:18] <YoG> bitflip, is there a known problem with the drivers shipped with ubuntu?
[08:18] <Geoffrey2> gl1tch, oh yes, Edgy also has Firefox 2 in it's repositories....as far as I know, you still need to manually install FF 2 under Dapper
[08:19] <__doc___> hi, I'm annoyed about the terminal programm installed by default on ubuntu. It is sooo slow to update it's buffer (yes I've got all the right binary drivers running (3d accerlation runs) and I've got a fast pc)
[08:19] <bitflip> YoG: I understand that - ra0 is typically an RaLink chipset - there are four different version
[08:19] <LewyJH> is there an easier way to update to edgy from dapper without making a cd?
[08:19] <__doc___> any idea about an alternative nice&fast terminal programm for gnome?
[08:19] <mordof> alright, can anyone help me get mod_rewrite enabled in apache2 from the ubuntu dapper distros? i have no idea where to even start and the apache docs n stuff aren't helping very much.. and i've tried googling it

[08:21] <defrysk> LewyJH, make sure to make a backup , just in case
[08:21] <gl1tch> does 6.10 instead of the 6.06 runs as server?
[08:22] <LewyJH> once i update, how do i roll back to 6.06(dapper) if i want to? is that possible with a backup?
[08:22] <dsnyders> !upgrade | dsnyders
[08:22] <ubotu> dsnyders: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[08:23] <bitflip> YoG: I think that is an rt61 chipset - lsmod | grep rt (Do you see rt61 by chance)
[08:23] <bitflip> YoG: if you do then yes, Edgy has a problem with wireless - it won't work unless you download new driver from RaLinks website
[08:23] <gl1tch> does version  6.10 instead of the 6.06 runs as server?
[08:23] <YoG> bitflip: yes i am
[08:24] <gl1tch> what is edgy?
[08:24] <gl1tch> and what is dapper
[08:24] <gl1tch> 3 questions i got
[08:24] <gl1tch> :D
[08:24] <bitflip> YoG: is it rt61pci or just rt61?
[08:24] <gl1tch> and only had one before enter here LOll
[08:24] <gl1tch> this is goin to be long
[08:24] <LewyJH> dapper is an older versio nof ubuntu, and edgy is the new version on ubuntu
[08:24] <YoG> bitflip: rt61
[08:24] <gl1tch> one checked thankx lew ;)
[08:25] <LewyJH> anytime
[08:25] <YoG> bitflip, i manage to use it - but only without encryption
[08:25] <DarkMageZ> dappper has Long Term Support, edgy doesn't. so it might be preferable to use dapper on a server
[08:25] <__doc___> see for instance, konsole is already much better then the terminal that comes with ubuntu
[08:25] <LewyJH> i use dapper.
[08:25] <gl1tch> its on a testing server @ home
[08:25] <gl1tch> i will use vmware
[08:25] <gl1tch> is there anything wrong with it?
[08:26] <LewyJH> would i have a better chance of getting my wireless up and running if i updated to edgy?
[08:26] <bitflip> YoG: http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm - 11/22/2006 is the latest driver, along with readme - even works for x86_64  w00t!

[08:54] <YoG> bitflip, but I'm willing to try and always eager to learn
[08:54] <bitflip> YoG: did you grap the RT61_Linux_STA_Drv1.1blabhblahblahb.gz?
[08:54] <YoG> bitflip: you mean did i downloaded it? yes
[08:55] <YoG> bitflip, and untared it - and ran make all - then i failed
[08:55] <bitflip> YoG: inside of Module?
[08:55] <YoG> bitflip: yes

=== firefoxjedi_ is now known as firefoxjedi
[08:57] <bitflip> YoG: you need to get the linux-kernel-headers for development - apt-get it first
[08:58] <cafuego__> linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[08:58] <YoG> bitflip, can i do it on another computer? (other than the one I'm going to install the card)
[08:58] <YoG> bitflip (same kernel)
[08:59] <ce_singel> hai
[08:59] <bitflip> YoG: if it's the same arch/kernel
[09:00] <YoG> bitflip, it is - same distribution - almost the same cpu (P-III800 & PIII-600)
[09:00] <bitflip> YoG: before jumping through all these hoops - did you cp *.bin to /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/ yet?
[09:01] <defrysk> kristalino, sudo apt-get install libguile-dev
[09:01] <YoG> bitflip: ha? no... what is that?
[09:01] <bitflip> YoG: it's the firmware and it doesn't ship with ubuntu - you have to have it in order for the card to work
[09:01] <bitflip> YoG: it came inside that tarball you unzipped
[09:02] <bitflip> YoG: you have to do this:  sudo mkdir /etc/Wireless/RT61STA -p && sudo cp *.bin /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/
=== c0 is now known as co_singel
[09:02] <YoG> bitflip: on the which system, the one that I'm going to compile on or the one that is going to use the card?

[09:04] <YoG> bitflip, done.

[09:04] <triplc> hi all, i've just installed Edgy but cannot find /etc/inittab; i would like to run encfs right after boot, anyone please help
[09:04] <bitflip> YoG: sudo ifconfig ra0 down && sudo rmmod rt61
[09:05] <bitflip> YoG: at this point "ifconfig" with no params should *not* display ra0
[09:05] <bitflip> YoG: nor should rt61 show up in lsmod | grep rt61
[09:06] <YoG> bitflip: that will disconnect the computer from the netwrok - i won't be able to transfer the files - maybe we'll do that at the end?
[09:06] <bitflip> YoG: are you on windows or something now with this card?

[09:16] <P-Smurf> Is there anyway possible to consult with a dev or someone official?
[09:16] <P-Smurf> contact references? email? something
[09:16] <bitflip> YoG: I don't know if stock unbuntu drivers use these or the RaLink but a point of interest:  http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/phpBB2/search.php?mode=results
[09:17] <P-Smurf> the problem i have wont be solved by me or someone in this room, its a kernel issue i think, ive done a little research

[09:19] <rega> well my vnc broke after my edgy update...
[09:19] <YoG> bitflip, I'm sure i did (after installing the headers)
[09:20] <bitflip> YoG: if you manage to run RaLinks then you can $(EDITOR) /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/rt61sta.dat and change AuthMode and EncrypType to your choosing

[09:21] <bitflip> YoG: the only thing is I would suggest adding rt61 to /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common if you go this route so an update doesn't break this once you get it going
[09:21] <dreamer> hmm, I have a dvd with data, but I don't know where to open it and read the data

[09:30] <spunconfuse> I cannot get these video's to play in ubuntu. In installed mplayer and a bunch of codecs but no go. http://www.spaghettimoon.co.uk/downloadpot.htm
[09:31] <spunconfuse> can anyone els play any of those vidios
[09:31] <orphean> spunconfuse, if mplayer isn't playing those wmv's you might be out of luck
[09:32] <spunconfuse> d'oh
[09:33] <orphean> spunconfuse, install vlc and see if vlc plays them.
[09:33] <spunconfuse> ok
[09:33] <amir_> Does anyone know if there's an alternative to not having Flash 8 or 9?
[09:34] <dreamer> spunconfuse: mplayer plays them with me
[09:34] <Duckman0> quicktime?
[09:34] <Duckman0> lol
[09:34] <spunconfuse> I wonder what the difference could be.
[09:35] <spunconfuse> I'm running ubuntu 6.10
[09:35] <amir_> Duckman0: well I am trying to play flash games and they need higher than 7
[09:35] <dreamer> and I still can't find the data of my dvd :/
[09:35] <dreamer> I burned it with this player, I should be able to read it :P
[09:35] <spunconfuse> there is flash 9 for linux out there.
[09:36] <First|Laptop> hmm
[09:36] <First|Laptop> !flash9
[09:36] <ubotu> You can download a Flash 9 installer here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/backports/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy).  If you use GDebi to install it, make sure you open its terminal window (to answer an installer question).
[09:36] <spunconfuse> orphean,  they work with VLC!  thanks!
[09:36] <orphean> yay!
[09:37] <orphean> amir_: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279990
[09:37] <amir_> spunconfuse: I can get flash 9?
[09:37] <orphean> howto for flash9
[09:37] <dreamer> so where, in konqueror for example, can I find my dvd-player and the data on the dvd that is in it?
[09:37] <dreamer> they aren't in /media/cdrom
[09:38] <orphean> dreamer: open up /etc/fstab and see where it's telling ubuntu to mount them
[09:39] <dreamer> orphean: I have played a movie-dvd from this drive before though
[09:39] <orphean> yeah I wasn't saying change any of it ;)
[09:39] <squeaks> hey all, my laptop hard drive's head is flapping around not allowing to get past BIOS, is there a way to force linux to see it and try to get data off of it
[09:40] <orphean> it'll just tell you where the mountpoint is so you can find it in konquerer
[09:40] <dreamer> orphean: /media/cdrom0/ I guess, but that also doesn't show any data
[09:40] <squeaks> what sort of functions or hardware key words can i look for more information?
[09:40] <orphean> dreamer, then its not mounted for some weird reason.
[09:40] <dreamer> strange, I just burned a cd with that drive
[09:40] <squeaks> could i apply > Vcc power to the drive to maybe get it to spin up right?
[09:41] <Duckman0> will installing 32 bit things on my 64 bit distro hurt it?
[09:41] <orphean> squeaks, if you have a live cd you can boot off it and get a working system, and then try to mount the drive.
[09:41] <dreamer> orphean: could it bu because I burned the dvd in windows ?
[09:41] <orphean> possibly but you would've had to burn it in some wacky format if so
[09:42] <squeaks> orphean, yes, i'm booted into knoppix, but i can only get past bios by plugging in the drive after the bios exits, so that means no bios message saying a hard drive is plugged in
[09:42] <orphean> dreamer, open a terminal and type the following, sudo mount /media/cdrom0 and see what it says
[09:42] <dreamer> orphean: it's just plain data, docs and pics mostly
[09:43] <dreamer> mount: block device /dev/hdd is write-protected, mounting read-only
[09:43] <dreamer> hey it worked :)
[09:43] <orphean> there we go :)
[09:43] <dreamer> in konqueror I can view the files on it :)
[09:43] <dreamer> many thnx orphean :)
[09:43] <karat> Is there a way to list vulnerable packages that are installed?
[09:43] <karat> ie ones that there are usn's out for
[09:44] <orphean> squeaks, ugh. that sounds super hosed. No idea my friend, I'm sorry.
[09:44] <vlt> Hello. Which pkg do I need to edit a postscript file (copy, move, delete, resize ... objects)?
[09:44] <squeaks> it was weird, i dropped it, and it worked the next time i rebooted, but not the 2nd time

[10:08] <JoePits> is the alternative disc different at all once installed or just the installer is different
[10:09] <SomeGame|Stryker> Ok well I got a box of the old Ubuntu discs I received in the mail like 6 months ago maybe longer.
[10:09] <Guardian> hello
[10:09] <SomeGame|Stryker> I used to have it installed on another partition on my old computer.
[10:09] <ixce> hey guys what kind of bus is the PCI bus?
[10:09] <highneko> solid_liq: The people in #ubuntu-xgl are very helpful. :3
[10:09] <Guardian> i can put additional modules in /etc/modules file, but how would i control the exact load order for each module please ?
[10:10] <SomeGame|Stryker> Anyways I built a new one and it has a SATA2 HD.  I left 25 or so gigs open on an empty partion incase I decided to install a second OS.
[10:10] <SomeGame|Stryker> I decided I'd pop in an install disc since I have like 40 of them
[10:10] <LordMetroid> hi people, How do I find out available space on my HDD?
[10:10] <SomeGame|Stryker> I got to the partition part and it's blank it doesn't show any partitions
[10:10] <highneko> LordMetroid: df -h
[10:10] <SomeGame|Stryker> So I don't know what to do next
[10:10] <LordMetroid> highneko: thank you

[10:13] <JoePits> i think
[10:13] <JoePits> and one swap
[10:13] <SomeGame|Stryker> Yes it didn't display any other options than manual partitioning.
[10:13] <SomeGame|Stryker> And when that came up it said it was listing my partitions but there were none listed just other options like RAID setup.
[10:14] <SomeGame|Stryker> I have installed Ubuntu before but not on this computer (which is SATA2 HD)

[10:16] <SomeGame|Stryker> From the forums - Hello there,
[10:16] <SomeGame|Stryker> i had the exact same problem. Seems like the Asrock jMicron sataII chip is not recognized by Ubuntu. (I had to put it in SATAI too)
[10:16] <SomeGame|Stryker> However, after the installation i updated the kernel, and every other thing that was outdated and SATAII worked fine!
[10:16] <SomeGame|Stryker> So it looks like I have to plug it into the SATA1 port.
[10:17] <SomeGame|Stryker> Kinda lame
[10:17] <boky> does someone can help me with buying modem for ubuntu distro
[10:17] <niksavel> any1?
[10:17] <solid_liq> boky: get an external if possible
[10:17] <solid_liq> boky: otherwise, check www.linmodems.org
[10:17] <boky> i need some modem which I can install without any problem
[10:17] <burwaco> good morning everyone !!!
[10:18] <solid_liq> boky: they have a list of supported modems
[10:18] <burwaco> jambo sana !
[10:18] <solid_liq> boky: external is the easiest by far
[10:18] <highneko> SomeGame|Stryker: I'm not wrong, because I used the word maybe. I'm just trying to get lots of information out of you so someone else with more knowledge can help you. ;)
[10:18] <boky> OK, I can get external, but which??
[10:18] <burwaco> !irc client for x
[10:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about irc client for x - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:19] <niksavel> I have a new strange problem which started happening since yesterday (the only change I did to the comp is uninstall beryl and xgl and started using metacity again)... I have read/write access to my mounted fat32 disk, but than after some time it becomes read only all by itself and I have to reboot to get access again...  somebody please help! :/
[10:19] <looktj> rofl!

[10:21] <SomeGame|Stryker> Hello there,

[10:21] <YoG> bitflip: thanx!!! it works :D
[10:21] <SomeGame|Stryker> Is there a free way to get Wine/Cedega?
[10:22] <bitflip> :)
[10:22] <boky> does ubuntu support USB external modems and is it better solutions then seral modem?
[10:22] <YoG> bitflip, can you help me bring this to prefection?
=== michael__ is now known as MTecknology
[10:23] <bitflip> YoG: Depends, I'm about to call it a night - what help do you need?
[10:23] <Hmg4> I can't get my autopackage to work, anyone?
[10:23] <niksavel> I have a new strange problem which started happening since yesterday (the only change I did to the comp is uninstall beryl and xgl and started using metacity again)... I have read/write access to my mounted fat32 disk, but than after some time it becomes read only all by itself and I have to reboot to get access again...  somebody please help! :/
[10:23] <Corbeaux> nothing is better than serial as far as modems are concerned
[10:23] <YoG> bitflip, how do i make this permanent - now i need to run the "load" script to start the connection
[10:24] <boky> Corbeaux: this days is very hard to find seral modems, can you suggest me some model?
[10:24] <YoG> bitflip, the "ko" files are also in my temporary folder - where should i put them?
[10:24] <fialar> anyone know why the linux-source and linux-headers are mismatched? When I try to compile modules against the linux-image, it goes and creates a new /lib/modules dir
[10:24] <highneko> SomeGame|Stryker: uncomment your /etc/apt/sources.list then sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get install wine
[10:24] <bitflip> YoG: sudo echo "iface ra0 inet dhcp" >> /etc/network/interfaces
[10:24] <burwaco> poll: what is the best irc client for Xfce4 ? Or a good one ?
[10:25] <fialar> burwaco: irssi
[10:25] <YoG> bitflip, shouldn't i copy the ko files somewhere?
[10:25] <burwaco> fialar: I have X running for a reason...
[10:26] <bitflip> YoG: you may not need to modules - you probably only needed the firmware, i.e. /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/*
[10:26] <fialar> burwaco: um.. X-chat then?
[10:26] <Corbeaux> boky: i can't. I heard enough stories about people's experiences with winmodems that i got myself a serial before trying anything else
[10:26] <cherubiel> burwaco: bitchx and xchat
[10:26] <umer> hai
[10:26] <sc4ttrbrain> apt-get update always gives me error ,that some sites,cant be reached temporary (for the first time), the second time of apt-get update it always works, is there error or its just my network problem?
[10:26] <burwaco> fialar: ever used bitchX ?
[10:26] <YoG> bitflip, ah - I'll try rebooting and see... if i do need the modules - where whould i put them?
[10:26] <fialar> burwaco: yes, but bitchX is no longer being actively developed
[10:26] <matthew_> yay, I'm back!
[10:26] <bitflip> YoG: buy my statement that you don't need the modules, I mean the stock ubuntu ko's may work perfectly fine
[10:27] <bitflip> YoG: -just a sec...
[10:27] <burwaco> fialar: and xchat is ?
[10:27] <fialar> how do I create an initial ramdisk like ubuntu makes for the stock ubuntu kernels?
[10:27] <fialar> burwaco: a graphical IRC client
[10:27] <umer> how can i open yahoo messenger in ubuntu
[10:27] <fialar> umer: apt-get install gaim
[10:27] <Guardian> i can put additional modules in /etc/modules file, but how would i control the exact load order for each module please ?
[10:28] <sc4ttrbrain> umer: try gyachi for voice and webcam support
[10:28] <highneko> Guardian: I always thought they would load from top to bottom, is this not true?
[10:28] <burwaco> fialar: no, I was jumping in on your last statement, is xchat still actively developped.
[10:28] <burwaco> ?
[10:28] <fialar> burwaco: yes
[10:28] <sc4ttrbrain> !gyachi
[10:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gyachi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:28] <Guardian> highneko: those that are in /etc/modules yes
[10:29] <mansfeld> hi folks
[10:29] <MeisterZopf> someone knows a command-line tool to read id3tags from mp3 files?
[10:29] <Guardian> highneko: but other modules are loaded before
[10:29] <fialar> MeisterZopf: id3
[10:30] <bitflip> YoG: sorry - anyhow you can just cp them to /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/volatile/ && depmod -a
[10:30] <MeisterZopf> fialar, thanks

=== michael__ is now known as MTecknology
[10:39] <YoG> bitflip, i have a cursor and i can control it - but it looks that it didn't finished loading
[10:40] <YoG> bitflip, also it tool a long time to arrive to this state
[10:40] <YoG> bitflip, now the bars disappeared
[10:40] <YoG> bitflip - i see just the desktop
[10:40] <we2by> !java
[10:40] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[10:41] <php-freak> How can I turn off my laptop sensor mouse, cause my hand keeps hitting it. I have an external mouse.
[10:41] <eilker>  i need to configure my dhcpd.conf, but i dont know why, could anyone share his file with me ??           sudo kate /etc/dhcpd.conf
[10:41] <dreamer> orphean: aaah, the tray of my dvd-drive won't open :o
[10:41] <YoG> bitflpip, anything?
[10:41] <bitflip> YoG: restart X for starters, i.e. killall gdm or <CTRL><ALT><BACKSPACE>
[10:42] <al> Hi all, is there anyone here who realy knows their stuff, please
[10:42] <cwraig> php freak - you could comment out the entry for your touchpad in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and then press ctrl+alt+backspace to restart the x server
[10:42] <umer> how can i create an account  gaim
[10:42] <YoG> bitflip just a sec
[10:43] <cwraig> then when u want to turn it back on you just remove the commented part and restart the X server again
[10:43] <matthew_> Remember, you can just _start_ typing a username and hit "tab" to complete it automatically; if the completed name is not the one that you needed, hit "tab" until the one you want comes up.
[10:43] <YoG> bitflip, same thing - now i see the brown background... (before the picture of gnome loading)
[10:44] <php-freak> cwraig, okay so just open the terminal and type /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and comment it out
[10:44] <cwraig> open the terminal and type sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:44] <cwraig> that should open the xorg file in gedit
[10:44] <bitflip> YoG: none of the rt61 process should affect this...At all.  You made a comment that you made a start up script - how?
[10:44] <cwraig> or if your confidant with vi you could do it in that
[10:45] <php-freak> now does g stand for get
[10:45] <php-freak> when you say gedit?
[10:45] <al> is there anyone in here who knows a shit load about computers, not just an operating system, ?
[10:45] <YoG> bitflip, no startup script - i was only asking if i should make one...
[10:45] <matthew_> stands for gnome
[10:45] <matthew_> or gtk
[10:45] <First|Laptop> !ask
[10:45] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:45] <matthew_> not sure which
[10:45] <YoG> biflip, still brown screen and cursor
[10:46] <matthew_> php-freak, that answer your question?
[10:46] <cwraig> php-freak gedit is a text editor
[10:46] <php-freak> okay
[10:46] <php-freak> i see
[10:46] <bitflip> YoG: kill your xserver again and login in with a failsafe term session before you enter your password
[10:46] <matthew_> php-freak, it's similar to kate in function
[10:46] <YoG> bitflip, now - gnome has loaded and i see the empy bars
[10:46] <php-freak> okay
[10:46] <al> I have lost contact with all 6 partitions that hold an operating ststem, but not those partitions that just hold data
[10:47] <cwraig> php-freak if youbreak down that function you can see exactly what it does
[10:47] <YoG> bitflip, ok
[10:47] <php-freak> well I open the /etc/xll/xorg.conf
[10:47] <php-freak> and it was blank
[10:47] <bitflip> YoG: you should be in X with nothing but xterm and it should load fairly fast
[10:47] <cwraig> you need a capital Xin X11
[10:47] <Feral_Kid> Good morning all... Does anyone use VMware Server with Dapper?
[10:47] <burwaco_> to bring you guys up and running... I booted from the xubuntu alternate cd, installed command line, then apt-got x-server and some xfce packages, not the meta because I didn't want all the junk that comes with it. Problem is now that Xfce4 doesn't save my settings after a reboot, all desktopp settings, firefox settings etc.... How commes ? .config files are in my /home directory for those apps, but still...
[10:48] <matthew_> Feral_Kid, heh, where I live, it's midnight...
[10:48] <al> partitions are both linux and win
[10:48] <burwaco_> matthew_, where I live it's noon...

[10:48] <al> use a paperclip dreamer
[10:48] <matthew_> burwaco_, Isn't the intraweb a beautiful thing?
[10:48] <BrokenPipe> What is the linux DVD ripping app?
[10:48] <burwaco_> dreamer, in terminal type eject
[10:49] <frandavid100> hi
[10:49] <dreamer> I had to mount the drive in order to view some files on a dvd, but now I can't open it
[10:49] <umer> in login options gaim account what ti write in screen name
[10:49] <matthew_> dreamer. sudo eject
[10:49] <Feral_Kid> matthew_> It is 1:48 here... Hence a good morning... :)
[10:49] <frandavid100> how can I remove a folder from the commandline?
[10:49] <al> unmount it dreamer
[10:49] <matthew_> rmdir
[10:49] <matthew_> frandavid100, rmdir
[10:49] <dreamer> bitflip, al, burwaco_ matthew_ : sudo eject did the trick
[10:49] <frandavid100> thanks matthew
[10:49] <matthew_> frandavid100, it means remove directory...
[10:50] <frandavid100> and if it's not empty?
[10:50] <YoG> bitflip, i have the xterm
[10:50] <burwaco_> dreamer, I was pretty surprised the first time too
[10:50] <frandavid100> is there any command modifier?
[10:50] <matthew_> frandavid100, go into the directory and type rm *
[10:50] <al> so no one has any idea about my problem?
[10:50] <Feral_Kid> Or better yet, is there a channel that talks about using VMserver with Ubuntu? I am doing something that is probably quite simple, but I am not familiar enough with VMware server...
[10:50] <frandavid100> alrighty
[10:50] <solid_liq> anyone know why this line isn't giving me the packages for this repo?   deb http://beryl-mirror.lupine.me.uk dapper main all
[10:50] <matthew_> frandavid100, That's what I do, but I know there's a better way...
[10:50] <solid_liq> I'm on amd64
[10:51] <dreamer> burwaco_: I was surprised I had to mount it in order to read the files on the dvd
[10:51] <YoG> bitflip, what now?
[10:51] <bitflip> YoG: and what happens when you type gnome-session
[10:51] <dreamer> I burned cd's and watched dvd-mozies with the drive
[10:51] <frandavid100> it worked anyway, thanks a lot matthew ^^
[10:51] <YoG> bitflip, just a sec.

[10:51] <php-freak> or is it possible?
[10:52] <matthew_> al, what's the problem?
[10:52] <Frederick> php-freak: what do you need?
[10:52] <Frederick> should be out of the box
[10:52] <solid_liq> matason: well atheros works fine, but you'll probably need to get the madwifi driver after the install
[10:52] <Feral_Kid> solid_liq> What machine are you using? I have been playing with my HP dv8000z series laptop, but I am still using 32-bit version of Ubuntu...
[10:52] <php-freak> frederick: well its not working my sound card
[10:52] <solid_liq> Frederick: what's freecap?

[10:56] <matthew_> al, what os are you using right now?
[10:56] <al> using kanotix on laptop
[10:56] <Feral_Kid> solid_liq> Well, I was having difficulties so I fell back... I am getting ready to remove the 80G drive from my HP and install 2 120G drives. Once I do that, I will give 64-bit Edgy a go...
[10:56] <solid_liq> Frederick: google for ssh tips and tricks
[10:56] <noelferreira> an association with my ap
[10:56] <YoG> bitflip - empty toolbars
[10:56] <matthew_> ok...let me think on this one...
[10:56] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: that's a strange way to upgrade :D
[10:56] <bitflip> YoG: I'm not sure - did you apt-get anything during this process?
[10:56] <matthew_> What was the last thing you did under linux?
[10:56] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: ide?
[10:57] <boky> which modem model is the best solution for ubuntu?
[10:57] <noelferreira> sorry not now bitflip: ra0       Interface doesn't support scanning.
[10:57] <al> i use ranish partiton manager to rewrit mbr to swap between os
[10:57] <noelferreira> use to show it
[10:57] <solid_liq> boky: dude, I told you, check linmodems.org
[10:57] <Feral_Kid> solid_liq> Yeah, that is all I can use, although I am going to replace the 5400 with 7200...
[10:57] <matthew_> al, try reinstalling grub...what were you mucking about in the MBR for?
[10:57] <php-freak> Can someone help me I got a gateway 4026 laptop, and need to get the sound card drivers working with it.
[10:57] <solid_liq> boky: if it's fully supported, it'll be just as good as any other, and the external are the best
[10:57] <bitflip> noelferreira: is this a stock rt61 driver or from RaLinks website?
[10:57] <boky> i cheked, but there is no list of modem models, or I didn't find it
[10:58] <YoG> bitflip, just sysutils for dos2linux
[10:58] <matthew_> !grub
[10:58] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:58] <al> because i have 6 op systems and mbr can only take 4 at a time
[10:58] <noelferreira> ralinks bitflip
[10:58] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: oh, that'll make a big diff then
[10:58] <al> so i use ranish partition manager. it is very good
[10:58] <YoG> bitflip, now the bars disappered agiain
[10:58] <bitflip> noelferreira: and you have /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/rt61sta.dat configured for your connection, correct?
[10:59] <al> i cant access the partitions to reinstall grub
[10:59] <Feral_Kid> solid_liq> And then I will do a RAID 0 for speed, and then if I could figure out how to get VMware server working correctly, I will just VM the Windows crap...
[10:59] <php-freak> What is this red lin I keep getting through my x chat lol.
[10:59] <solid_liq> php-freak: start with lspci to see what type of sound hardware you have, then www.google.com/linux for it
[10:59] <matthew_> al, read the link that ubotu just displayed. You can also edit the grub by sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:59] <al> unless i tell mbr, they cant be found
[10:59] <noelferreira> i don't know bitflip i used to get this arounf without that file but now i don't know what goes wrong
[10:59] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: good idea, and vmware server is EASY
[10:59] <bitflip> YoG: to be quite honest with you - I'm more of a cli junky so someone else with gnome-fu might have to bail you out on this
[11:00] <noelferreira> my system crash every time and it is ok when i delete that file and /etc/network/interfaces
[11:00] <cwraig> hey php freak howd you go with the mouse thing
[11:00] <matthew_> al, I don't know what else to do. Sorry.
[11:00] <bitflip> YoG: I can say that none of this wireless stuff should affect your gnome session, profile, etc
[11:00] <solid_liq> bitflip: heheh, I used to only use the cli for awhile because a gui is such a ram hog
[11:00] <Feral_Kid> Speaking of VMware... Does anyone know how to get a VM to use the windows on /dev/hda2 as opposed to dealing with a virtual drive...
[11:00] <noelferreira> i used firmaware and then i removed it bitflip
[11:00] <Patman> how can i compile a driver for my matrox g450 from source?
[11:00] <YoG> bitflip, just maybe the wireless applet - any idea how can i remove it from the toolbars (without having the toolbars)?
[11:01] <sc4ttrbrain> anyone,how to change the amount of memory shared by ati radeon from 64 mb to 128 mb?
[11:01] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: you can't you have to build a virtual drive
[11:01] <noelferreira> and i only have the bin files from Module directory in /etc/Wireless/RT....
[11:01] <bitflip> noelferreira: you can't use rt61 from RaLink's site *without* that firmware...and to my knowledge ubuntu edgy's rt61 either
[11:01] <al> the problem is with my boot sector or whatever, because for all intent puposes they are not there
[11:01] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: but you may be able to install linux in the virtual drive, leave enough space for windows, and then dd over your windows partition into the virtual partition
[11:01] <Feral_Kid> solid_liq> Yes, the 2 drives and bumping up to 2G and then I think I will a solid machine... Especially if I can get 64-bit going...
[11:01] <SilentDis> !swap
[11:01] <dv5237> how can i selecter diffrent wireless accespoints?
[11:01] <bitflip> noelferreira: just to be clear, regardless of which rt61 driver you use, you'll need that firmware
[11:01] <ubotu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[11:01] <al> nothing can find them
[11:01] <matthew_> al, is kanotix a live CD?
[11:02] <bitflip> YoG: just a sec. let me think/look
[11:02] <noelferreira> ok so copy those files is that right?
[11:02] <al> it is, but this is installed
[11:02] <bitflip> noelferreira: yes
[11:02] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: 2G of ram is very nice to have, it helps speed alot
[11:02] <matthew_> ok, try booting off the live CD
[11:02] <php-freak> now where does xchat go when it installed it? is it the bin folder it goes too?
[11:02] <Feral_Kid> solid_liq> Hmm, that seems like a PITA to get that working correctly...
[11:03] <dv5237> is there a gnome system tray tool so i can easyly select diffrent wireless accespoints?
[11:03] <matthew_> al, when you reboot, try sudo cfdisk /dev/device_name
[11:03] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: it's not bad, pretty easy actually
[11:03] <noelferreira> i did it bitflip
[11:03] <matthew_> al,tell me what you see, please
[11:03] <mixandgo> I have some problems since my upgrade to edgy ! When I try to do an upgrade I get : Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic '--hide-main-window' '--non-interactive' '--parent-window-id' '52428803' '--progress-str' 'Please wait, this can take some time.' '--finish-str' 'Update is complete' '--set-selections-file' '/tmp/tmpCqr5Je' as user root.
[11:03] <mixandgo> Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file.
[11:03] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: but actually windows may freak come to think about it, because the hardware will be completely different
[11:03] <al> hang on mathew, give me 5
[11:04] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: under vmware, you use virtual hardware, so it looks completely different
[11:04] <tx22> Is there an unofficial ubuntu with codecs & drivers?
[11:04] <bronaugh> guys, I'm running Ubuntu 6.10.
[11:04] <nomin> php-freak, system>administration>synaptic then type "xchat" in the search and click properties.  It tells where all files are stored
[11:04] <bronaugh> I just tried azureus-gcj, and got an exception as it was trying to start up. anyone have a similar issue?
[11:04] <matthew_> al, ok, I'll be here
[11:04] <solid_liq> bronaugh: whoopdy doo! ;)
[11:04] <solid_liq> bronaugh: just kidding
[11:04] <bronaugh> yeah, I say whoop dee doo too.
[11:05] <rega> hey, so what does it mean when I can do a vncviewer :0 to myself but other computers can't connect, and as far as I know I'm not using a software firewall?
[11:05] <php-freak> okay cool
[11:05] <rega> uh /:0
[11:05] <php-freak> nomin: is there a way to make my icons smaller on the desktop, they just look tooo big righ tnow
[11:05] <Feral_Kid> solid_liq> I guess I just boot off the install CD reload my system CD and go from there... This was just an experiment until I add the new drives...
[11:05] <slicky> is there a good dvd player that works with xgl?  vlc starts.. but i cant play any dvds..
[11:05] <matthew_> tx22, look for mint linux
[11:05] <noelferreira> what should i do now bitflip?
[11:06] <nomin> php-freak, yeah.  I can't remember how.  the option is somwhere.
[11:06] <bronaugh> anyhow, ktorrent works and I don't give a fuck, so ttyl.
[11:06] <solid_liq> Feral_Kid: you can point the virtual cdrom to an .iso file too if you want to boot from that
[11:07] <php-freak> nowin: you new to linux
[11:07] <umer> how con i chat with msn messenger
[11:07] <matthew_> Use Kopete
[11:07] <matason> umer: use gaim
[11:07] <umer> ok
[11:07] <matthew_> sudo apt-get install kopete
[11:07] <solid_liq> use kopete
[11:07] <matason> umer: or Kopete :)
[11:08] <matthew_> you might need the kde libs though
[11:08] <solid_liq> :D
[11:08] <umer> ok
[11:08] <matason> Is that better than Gaim?
[11:08] <solid_liq> yes
[11:08] <matason> Cool
[11:08] <matthew_> matason, I'm not sure
[11:08] <nomin> php-freak, I've been using it for about 3 years now but over the past year i've been using it the most.  I think I'm finally at the point where i can do everything on linux that I can do on windows.
[11:08] <osfameron> there are several things that are harder to do on windows than linux...
[11:08] <tx22> matthew Is this linux put together well, or is it slapped up and uploaded?
[11:08] <matthew_> I haven't used an XP machine for any purpose for about a month now...it's been great
[11:09] <solid_liq> nomin: I haven't used windows since a little before win xp came out :D
[11:09] <al> mathew, unknown partition table type. Do you wish to start with a zero table.
[11:09] <vincent__> what is a fast cdripper, cause soundjuicer doesnt seem to work
[11:09] <dv5237> is there a gnome system tray tool so i can easyly select diffrent wireless accespoints?
[11:09] <solid_liq> I've barely any experience with xp heheh
[11:09] <php-freak> nomin: well with linux you got more power don't you?
[11:09] <al> this partition is not the fist on the drve
[11:09] <bitflip> YoG: apologies - anyhow somewhere in your ~/ there has to be settings for you desktop - yes I could see an applet causing some havoc but I'm not sure where those settings are stored in a gnome session
[11:09] <SilentDis> vincent__: i use grip, personally
[11:10] <bimberi> !networkmanager | dv5237
[11:10] <ubotu> dv5237: networkmanager is an application to make (wireless) networking Just Work. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[11:10] <matthew_> tx22, not sure, I just saw an article about it online somewhere. I should think that it is made rather well, but that's just my unquenchable optimism. My advice? Install it and try it out. It's basically Ubuntu with all the codecs and "extra-legal" stuff included...
[11:10] <vincent__> tnx, will try it out
[11:10] <SilentDis> !grip | vincent__
[11:10] <ubotu> vincent__: grip is a ripping player and has a minor bug which can be solved by doing this "sudo ln -s /dev/hdX /dev/cdromN" where X is your hard drive and N a number
[11:10] <noelferreira> are you there bitflip?
[11:10] <osfameron> yeah, networkmanager is pretty sweet
[11:10] <matthew_> al, try cfdisk /dev/devicenamefollowedbypartitionnumber
[11:10] <nomin> php-freak, I'm not a programmer or too computer savvy.  I got into it just out of curiousity and found out I could use it instead of windows and not worry about malware.
[11:10] <tx22> matthew Yeah. If anyone knows if it's good or not, I'll consider redesigning the homepage for him
[11:10] <matthew_> al, example: sudo cfdisk /dev/hda3
[11:10] <solid_liq> YoG: if you happen to know what the applet is called, go to the shell, ps ax | grep insert_applets_name_here    then kill the process
[11:10] <vincent__> tnx
[11:11] <al> thats what i did
[11:11] <matthew_> tx22, is it that bad?
[11:11] <bitflip> noelferreira: you have /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/rt61sta.dat configured for your network, rt61 loaded, and ifconfig ra0 up, correct?
[11:11] <tx22> matthew Yeah, it's an aweful homepage
[11:11] <nomin> mythtv is a pretty cool app on linux.  It's a lot better than the app I got for my tv card on windows.
[11:11] <php-freak> nomin: im a computer programming :) php freak hehe
[11:12] <matthew_> tx22, yep, I'm looking at it, and the only good thing is the...never mind, there is nothing good...
[11:12] <noelferreira> yes bitflip
[11:12] <vincent__> <ubotu> tnx but grip isnt for my stystem
[11:12] <php-freak> nomin: this don't seem to hard to use, just not famaliar with it yet.
[11:12] <tx22> matthew hahaha
[11:12] <matthew_> al, hmmm, I don't know, then...try man grub
[11:12] <matthew_> or info grub
[11:12] <SilentDis> nomin: just curious - what TV card do you have, I'm looking to pick one up.  lost my tv-in capabilities when I swapped out my ATI AIW card for this sexxy geforce one hehe
[11:12] <nomin> php-freak, I think ubuntu is the most straightforward distro I've used so far.  It's the easiest to use, I think.
[11:12] <bitflip> noelferreira: and iwlist ra0 scan says not possible?
[11:12] <php-freak> yea
[11:12] <noelferreira> ya
[11:12] <php-freak> nomin: i bet there is some pretty complexed ones out there
[11:13] <php-freak> nomin, I should be able to get my sound card drivers working on this right?
[11:13] <bitflip> noelferreira: your using edgy?
[11:13] <nomin> SilentDis, I have a low priced one.  Its a hauppauge wintv go-plus that I bought for $50 2 years ago.
[11:13] <boink> php-freak: of course, but it depends on the chip
[11:13] <YoG> bitflip: it has something to do with the network because when i unload the module it comes up ok - I'll try removing all the applets and see if this is indeed the problem
[11:13] <php-freak> hmm, is that what I need to know the chip
[11:13] <al> mathew what would do that, damage different os but leave data untouched?
[11:13] <SilentDis> php-freak:  one thing REALLY sets ubuntu apart from every distro i've used - and that's the community.  never have i met such an inviting, helpful group in my LIFE :)
[11:13] <bitflip> YoG: that's a good place to start
[11:13] <php-freak> lol yea
[11:14] <php-freak> seems like friendly type people using this os
[11:14] <boink> maybe ubuntu is trying to make nerds into normal people :)
[11:14] <SilentDis> nomin:  low priced is good.  not looking to break the bank here, just watch tv, after all :)
[11:14] <matthew_> al, to be honest, I really don't know. Maybe Windows did it, but it probably didn't. My best guess? User error (sorry)
[11:14] <boink> but ideally, with a tv-card, the BTR878 chips are most linux-friendly.
[11:14] <noelferreira> dapper
[11:14] <boink> (if that's still the case ... )
[11:14] <noelferreira> bitflip: dapper
[11:14] <nomin> php-freak, I've found that the only real problem with linux is hardware compatibility.  On some older computers there is no driver for the sound cards.  However, I think linux is really taking off in general and hardware compatibilty is less and less of a problem as time progresses.  ie - it depends on yo0ur sound card.
[11:15] <burwaco> shutdown -r now
[11:15] <php-freak> Well let me find out the chipset, ill brb
[11:15] <edbe> mplayer guru, what this line means: mplayer -dvd-device /space/st-tng/disc1/ -dvd 1 -vo null -ao null -frames 0 -v 2>&1 | grep sid
[11:15] <burwaco> oopps
[11:15] <boink> if you buy any hardward first, do your homework and make sure it's linux-friendly
[11:15] <bimberi> !away > bokey
[11:15] <al> if that was the case mathew it wouldnt be the fist time, but i wasnt 'tinkering' if you know what i mean
[11:15] <solid_liq> heheheh, it seems like it's only people who use ubuntu who actually still have windows on their hdd.  I never hear anyone mention windows in #slackware, #gentoo, etc.
[11:15] <edbe> what the heck is that /space/st-tng/ ?
[11:15] <vincent__> Why is linux so tremendously slow on ripping.. with windows it was a breeze..
[11:15] <vincent__> it takes hours now..
[11:15] <umer> shall i get kopote free down load
[11:15] <SilentDis> boink:  recommendations for cards with that chipset?
[11:15] <php-freak> ohh yea wheres a good place to extract these script files, should I just exatract them into the xchat directory cause im going to load them up in xchat
[11:15] <boink> tv-cards?
[11:16] <bitflip> noelferreira: dapper works with rt61 without issues, it didn't break until edgy
[11:16] <edbe> vincent__: buy a new box ...  I rip things F.AS.T faster than winshit
[11:16] <solid_liq> vincent__: what ripping software?
[11:16] <chalcedony> where does someone go to get Xchat on Ubuntu?
[11:16] <boink> there's an online shop in germany which deals only with linux hardware. www.tuxhardware.de
[11:16] <edbe> apt-get install xchat
[11:16] <tx22> matthew do you know of any websites that need a new design and willing to pay?.. Or even a programs GUI.. or a poster, or a.. etc etc?
[11:16] <noelferreira> ya i know
[11:17] <boink> I don't know if there's such a business in the uk or not
[11:17] <vincent__> both soundjuicer an Kaudiocreator
[11:17] <edbe> mplayer guru, what this line means: mplayer -dvd-device /space/st-tng/disc1/ -dvd 1 -vo null -ao null -frames 0 -v 2>&1 | grep sid
[11:17] <noelferreira> i have it working almost for a year
[11:17] <chalcedony> edbe: dpm
[11:17] <SilentDis> vincent__:  grip is hella fast on my box.
[11:17] <bitflip> noelferreira: lspci | grep RaLink - what number does that return?
[11:17] <chalcedony> edbe: dont i go to a website for that?
[11:17] <noelferreira> that one lol
[11:17] <matthew_> al, Yeah, I do know what you mean...my systems have often paid the price for my mistakes...oh well, live and learn....at least you still have all your data...
[11:17] <nomin> chalcedony, synaptic is the easiest way to install software, imo.
[11:17] <chalcedony> is there a gui file installer thing for ubuntu that has it?
[11:17] <solid_liq> vincent__: try grip
[11:17] <matthew_> tx22, nope, can't think of any, although I'm really not the guy to talk to...
[11:17] <edbe> no chalcedony, you use your konsole/terminal for that
[11:17] <al> all except my address book!!!
[11:17] <nomin> chalcedony, system>administration>synaptic package manager
[11:17] <bitflip> noelferreira: there should be a number, like 0302
[11:17] <vincent__> SilentDis_: grip does not work on my system
[11:17] <matthew_> tx22, and no, I don't know who the guy to talk to is
[11:17] <matthew_> lol
[11:17] <SilentDis> vincent__:  from 60min CD to 224VBS HQ MP3s takes all of 10 min usually.  only got an Athlon 1900+ here :)
[11:17] <php-freak> whats the quickest way to find out my chipset for my sound card driver I have
[11:17] <tx22> matthew oh ok
[11:17] <matthew_> al, major bummer...too bad about that...
[11:17] <noelferreira> ya there is
[11:17] <al> other wise i would just fomat the drive and start again
[11:17] <edbe> vincent__ : you're so primitive ... use cdparanoia & lame
[11:18] <bimberi> chalcedony: Applications -> Add/Remove
[11:18] <SilentDis> vincent__:  why not?
[11:18] <bitflip> noelferreira: is this a laptop?
[11:18] <boink> php-freak: try lspci
[11:18] <edbe> only winshit refugees wanna use a GUI for ripping cd music
[11:18] <al> do you use thunderbird mathew
[11:18] <SilentDis> edbe:  that's exactly what grip is, just a front end to 'em both hehe
[11:18] <matthew_> well, I'm going to bed, good night, everyone...
[11:18] <matthew_> al, no, I use gmail...
[11:18] <vincent__> the I386, I get a message is does not support my system
[11:18] <matthew_> underdog500@gmail.com
[11:18] <matthew_> hold the spam
[11:19] <matthew_> g'night
[11:19] <slicky> where can i download linux torrents? like games n stuff
[11:19] <edbe> I know grip too SilentDis .... but here he was complaining about 'speed' .... then just use terminal
[11:19] <SilentDis> edbe:  oh, it's got a ID3 tagger and CDDB lookup too, of course.
[11:19] <php-freak> hehe with linux I can tell you have more power over your os, and the things you can do with it the capabilites, unlike windows
[11:19] <php-freak> linux is sussposed to be more stable too right?
[11:19] <asabil> hi all
[11:19] <al> can you store your mailbox on a network box with gmail
[11:19] <noelferreira> yes
[11:19] <boink> php-freak: well, depends
[11:19] <asabil> how can i install grub ?
[11:19] <asabil> I had lilo before (macbook)
[11:19] <SilentDis> edbe:  oh.  yeah, if you want FAST... the term is the way to go.  couple commands can have a song for you, so long as you know what to type :)
[11:19] <edbe> SilentDis, what for is id3 tagger? you don't know what cd that you're ripping?
[11:19] <edbe> use easytag or amarok for mass tag
[11:20] <boink> ubuntu is less bloat than windows, but still some bloat
[11:20] <badwarrior> hello people somebody here ???
[11:20] <bitflip> noelferreira: not to be unsulting but in the interest of thoroughness, is it turned on hardware wise?
[11:20] <vincent__> well yeah :P I look some further
[11:20] <boink> !ask
[11:20] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:20] <SilentDis> edbe:  I'm lazy.  why should I type 'em in when the 'puter can do it for me?  lol
[11:20] <chalcedony> huggles badwarrior
[11:20] <badwarrior> :)
[11:20] <badwarrior> hugs ch
[11:20] <chalcedony> :)
[11:20] <badwarrior> hugs chalcedonyy :D
[11:20] <php-freak> what do you mean by bloat?
[11:20] <umer> lll
[11:20] <boink> like gnome
[11:20] <edbe> create a bash code SilentDis ... just take you a minute to automate it
[11:20] <chalcedony> badwarrior: show them what happened
[11:20] <boink> or even kde .. both can be bloaty at times
[11:20] <vincent__> see ya
[11:20] <boink> but not as bad as windows bloat
[11:21] <badwarrior> edbe: look i now running a linux ubuntu and i dont have the console for setting modes like: away like on nick to set : or ,
[11:21] <SilentDis> boink:  Beryl is bloat... but it's damn pretty bloat :D
[11:21] <badwarrior> how to set it the console back ?
[11:21] <badwarrior> a
[11:21] <boink> but with ubuntu, if you don't like gnome, there are many other window managers which you could install
[11:21] <edbe> setting what 'mode'?
[11:21] <chalcedony> badwarrior: what irc client are you using now?
[11:21] <badwarrior> i dont have the console
[11:21] <badwarrior> i use xchat
[11:22] <chalcedony> ok
[11:22] <edbe> I'm using xchat too
[11:22] <badwarrior> i dont have the settings on xchat up
[11:22] <chalcedony> Xchat should have an away settng
[11:22] <edbe> in konsole/terminal you can use BitchX
[11:22] <mnepton> irssi is installed by deafult.
[11:22] <badwarrior> i dont need bitchx
[11:22] <bimberi> apokryphos: ping
[11:22] <mnepton> *default.
[11:22] <nomin> you can also use gaim for irc and a whole lot of other chat rooms
[11:22] <badwarrior> i dont need bitchx
[11:22] <mnepton> BX is not.
[11:23] <nomin> gaim does just about everything
[11:23] <edbe> you'd better know BitchX a little bit ... it's very useful when ... say, your system crash and all you have is a blank terminal
[11:23] <solid_liq> everyone has the console
[11:23] <solid_liq> press ctrl-alt-F1
[11:23] <edbe> know how to use links too
[11:23] <chalcedony> badwarrior: settings Preferences Chatting General see the Away boxes
[11:23] <nomin> yeah, I have BitchX and lynx installed in case my GUI messes up
[11:23] <badwarrior> yep
[11:23] <badwarrior> i dont have it !
[11:23] <badwarrior> :D
[11:23] <edbe> you'll need them to go online & find information as what's going on with your system
[11:23] <nomin> lynx is a console based web browser
[11:23] <solid_liq> and w3m and links are two cli webbrowsers
[11:23] <mnepton> edbe: w3m is installed by default. links is not.
[11:23] <chalcedony> badwarrior: #Xchat  ;)
[11:23] <umer> how can i use yahoo messenger in ubuntu
[11:24] <solid_liq> nomin: links is better than lynx, and so is w3m
[11:24] <nomin> and you'll want a console based text editor to fix files
[11:24] <edbe> links replaces lynx ... it's easier
[11:24] <SilentDis> lynx, bitchx, wget and a working 'net connection = raise any machine from the dead, complete with help :)
[11:24] <umer> sssss
[11:24] <solid_liq> nomin: lynx was actually the very first web browser ever made
[11:24] <edbe> I still have lynx
[11:24] <mnepton> umer: Applications -> Internet -> GAIM Internet Messenger
[11:24] <php-freak> only thing I don't like about linux is that everything seems biggers, like the text, and stuff
[11:24] <nomin> solid_liq, that's interesting.
[11:24] <bimberi> thanks Seveas :)
[11:24] <solid_liq> php-freak: heheh, you can change all the fonts, unlike with windows
[11:25] <nomin> php-freak, linux is fully configurable.  You can change all that stuff.
[11:25] <eilker> Please write a subnet declaration in your dhcpd.conf file for the  , network segment to which interface eth0 is attached. could anyone help pls ??
[11:25] <php-freak> lol how can i change it similar to windows?
[11:25] <mnepton> eilker: are you asking us to help you cheat on school work?
[11:25] <solid_liq> php-freak: you using gnome or kde?
[11:25] <php-freak> not sure
[11:25] <php-freak> I think gnome
[11:25] <nomin> I've seen a screenshot on kde-look.org of a linux desktop made to completely imitate xp
[11:26] <solid_liq> ick
[11:26] <solid_liq> php-freak: then use kde, and it'll be much more like windows
[11:26] <Seveas> php-freak, is it brown or purple
[11:26] <SilentDis> alright, off to check my order on amazon for my edgy DVDs, then off to bed.  g'night all.  :)
[11:26] <eilker> mnepton: sorry ???
[11:26] <solid_liq> php-freak: apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[11:26] <php-freak> i see hold on
[11:26] <mnepton> eilker: your question seems as if it is from a test or assignment
[11:26] <mnepton> php-freak: wait.
[11:27] <php-freak> lol
[11:27] <bitflip> have fun all
[11:27] <php-freak> yea i got this message E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13 Permission denied)
[11:27] <php-freak> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
[11:27] <eilker> mnepton: no, my dhcpd is not working, and i read this from syslog
[11:27] <mnepton> php-freak: do NOT install kubuntu-desktop until you give it a LOT of thought
[11:27] <php-freak> whys that?
[11:27] <badwarrior> edbe: how to install bitchx can you tell me the commands ?
[11:27] <solid_liq> eilker: any particular reason you're running a dhcp server?
[11:28] <mnepton> php-freak: because you will be installing an entirely different desktop manager, its associated libs, and its associated apps.
[11:28] <nomin> I don't think it's too big of a deal to install multiple desktops.  I have ubuntu and xubuntu-desktop installed and it's not a problem at all.
[11:28] <mnepton> NOT trivial
[11:28] <Tidus> i'm running xubuntu here with gnome installed
[11:28] <burwaco> badwarrior, sudo apt-get install btichx
[11:28] <mnepton> nomin: he's on a 14.4K dialup connection. still "not too big a deal?" ;)
[11:28] <badwarrior> then ?
[11:28] <badwarrior> i know is bitchx
[11:28] <badwarrior> then ?
[11:28] <php-freak> well I can always remove it can't I?
[11:29] <nomin> mnepton, oh, didn't know about that part.
[11:29] <mnepton> php-freak: not without effort
[11:29] <php-freak> lol why how long does it take?
[11:29] <badwarrior> burwaco ?
[11:29] <chalcedony> can someone show badwarrior how to delete and replace his Xchat .. he's missing key files
[11:29] <php-freak> does it look similar to windows xp desktop though?
[11:29] <mnepton> nomin: i'm not sure he is. but before i recommend multiple hundred megabyte downloads, i like to make sure. ;)
[11:29] <nomin> gotchya
[11:30] <mnepton> php-freak: you can customize GNOME to look XP-ish, or switch to KDE. but the switch is not trivial, and you should give it some thought before you do.
[11:30] <php-freak> trying to find out my chipset on my sound card, but I have no clue How i can obtain that information, or uncompile this software.
[11:30] <badwarrior> PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP ME ?
[11:30] <php-freak> mnepton: but I want it to look similar to xp?
[11:30] <mnepton> php-freak: System -> Administration -> Device Manager
[11:30] <bimberi> badwarrior: what is the problem?
[11:31] <php-freak> cool, I didn't know if there was a device manager or not
[11:31] <mnepton> php-freak: you can move the top and bottom panels, change fonts, change desktops, etc etc.
[11:31] <nomin> badwarrior, system>administration>synaptic package manager
[11:31] <chalcedony> bimberi: badwarrior is missing key files in his Xchat .. needs to replace it i think
[11:31] <nomin> badwarrior, sudo apt-get install BitchX
[11:31] <chalcedony> he doesnt need bx
[11:31] <nomin> too late
[11:31] <chalcedony> honestly
[11:31] <mnepton> why not just have him use irssi?
[11:31] <chalcedony> can't you guys hear
[11:31] <chalcedony> ?
[11:32] <mnepton> irssi is on every Ubuntu machine. BX is not.
[11:32] <burwaco> badwarrior ?
[11:32] <chalcedony> this is the 'magic' of a linux help channel .. if you have 'green' they tell you you need 'red'
[11:32] <php-freak> i get confused on uncompiling this software when I downloaded it, is there usually a help file in ever folder when I download it, and extract i?
[11:32] <chalcedony> and if you have 'red' then you must have 'green'
[11:32] <YoG> hi, can someone help me? when i start gnome and the network is on the panels crash... when i start with the network off (ifdown ra0) it loads ok
[11:32] <mnepton> php-freak: you should not have to compile stuff very often. there are packages for almost everything.
[11:32] <solid_liq> chalcedony: no, that's the ubuntu channel, which is populated by noobs helping noobs
[11:32] <bimberi> chalcedony: or one that you're supposed to be able to hear? ;)
[11:33] <mnepton> YoG: check the panel applets. one may rely on net connectivity (e.g. weather)
[11:33] <solid_liq> chalcedony: try ##linux if you want people who've used linux for a long time
[11:33] <HumanPrototype> is there a version of linux that I can install that will boot up to show tsclient so I can connect to a windows terminal server?
[11:33] <burwaco> badwarrior, just "sudo apt-get install bitchx" then "killall gnome-panel" then it should show up in the menu or just type bitchx in a console
[11:33] <solid_liq> HumanPrototype: yeah, I think it's actually called tslinux.  try www.distrowatch.com
[11:34] <chalcedony> solid_liq: i come here because such nice people are here.. you don't ban me for having a nick starting with c for instance ;)
[11:34] <php-freak> okay, how do I usually open the packages?
[11:34] <nomin> badwarrior already left
[11:34] <YoG> mnepton: i tried removing all the applets - can there be "invisible" applets?
[11:34] <php-freak> do I have to use the terminal?
[11:34] <mnepton> burwaco: you're going to have to type in *much* bigger letters for badwarrior to see them :)
[11:34] <solid_liq> YoG: dude, use ps ax to look to see if it's running
[11:34] <mnepton> YoG: try moving .gconf aside and see wha'ppens.
[11:34] <Sp4rKy> hi
[11:34] <solid_liq> php-freak: the cli in linux is very user friendly
[11:34] <burwaco> mnepton, ???
[11:35] <solid_liq> php-freak: use tab completion to save typing
[11:35] <Sp4rKy> must i recompil the kernel after installing a kernel-patches-something
[11:35] <mnepton> burwaco: 05:32 -!- badwarrior [n=none@62.162.226.205]  has quit ["Lost terminal"] 
[11:35] <burwaco> mnepton, you should spank your irc client, not me...
[11:35] <solid_liq> Sp4rKy: is it your own custom built kernel?
[11:35] <hopler> hola
[11:36] <hopler> hay alguien?
[11:36] <YoG> mnepton: is .gconf - what holds all the definitions for the panels?
[11:36] <mnepton> !es > hopler
[11:36] <hopler> tengo un prooblema
[11:36] <mnepton> YoG: .gconf = GNOME configuration settings.
[11:36] <HumanPrototype> solid_liq: thanks
[11:36] <Sp4rKy> solid_liq: nop
[11:36] <hopler> i have a problem with  3d ati
[11:36] <mnepton> YoG: lots of stuff in there, not just apnel applets. but if by moving it aside the problem disappears, you have a better idea of the culprit.
[11:37] <Sp4rKy> solid_liq: i want to set vserver
[11:37] <php-freak> okay guys I got a 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M intel from what I see
[11:37] <php-freak> my sound card card
[11:37] <solid_liq> Sp4rKy: if you apt-get installed it, then you just need to reboot into it
[11:37] <mnepton> php-freak: can you hear the login sound?
[11:37] <Sp4rKy> solid_liq: it's a patch, not a kernel !
[11:37] <frandavid100> I need to trim an mp3 audio file, can you guys recommend me a good editor?
[11:38] <solid_liq> Sp4rKy: a kernel patch?
[11:38] <renzo17> audacity
[11:38] <mnepton> frandavid100: Audacity
[11:38] <bimberi> chalcedony: if (s)he contacts you rather than coming back in here tell them to try 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall xchat'
[11:38] <frandavid100> thanks!
[11:38] <php-freak> mnepton, Nope
[11:39] <php-freak> nothing
[11:39] <php-freak> I've tried playing sounds too
[11:39] <YoG> mnepton - just got an error window from gnome: "there was an error starting the GNOME setting deamon"... is it giving us any clues?
[11:39] <frandavid100> I tried using jokosher, but it crashes non-stop
[11:39] <mnepton> YoG: nope, that's expected. .gconf has gone "missing" but GNOME *should* load anyway.
[11:39] <mnepton> YoG: it will complain, but still start. or should.
[11:39] <YoG> mnepton: system exception: IDL:Bonobo/
[11:39] <chalcedony> bimberi: ty
[11:39] <YoG> mnepton: I didn't remove .gconf yet
[11:39] <mnepton> don't remove, just put aside. please. :)
[11:39] <bimberi> chalcedony: see, I was "listening" ;)
[11:40] <YoG> mnepton: ok, will do.
[11:40] <Sp4rKy> solid_liq: yep
[11:40] <philc> I am running kate in ubuntu, but it makes a lot of sounds when dialogs popup etc. How can I turn the sounds off for kde apps?
[11:40] <solid_liq> Sp4rKy: then you need to reboot into it
[11:40] <solid_liq> Sp4rKy: because the kernel is now different
[11:40] <php-freak> mnepton, : What should I do to get this working?
[11:40] <YoG> mnepton: what about .gconfd?
[11:40] <highneko> Why do some kde programs have a hard time finding the gnome panel notification area sometimes?
[11:41] <mnepton> YoG: try with that in place, and if it fails, set that aside, too.
[11:41] <mnepton> php-freak: checked the BIOS settings?
[11:41] <sinthetek> i am having trouble installing mysql client development & header libs in kubuntu
[11:41] <solid_liq> highneko: because gnome was designed by a bunch of monkeys.  KDE is much better ;)
[11:41] <php-freak> mnepton: bios setting were fine, I just took windows out it always worked before?
[11:42] <sinthetek> something about knotacts & kdepim dependencies
[11:42] <php-freak> mnepton: so yea the bios are fine
[11:42] <mnepton> php-freak: "It worked in Windows" means nothing in Linux.
[11:42] <sinthetek> kontacts*
[11:42] <php-freak> well the bios would still be the same
[11:42] <mnepton> php-freak: no, not necessarily.
[11:42] <highneko> solid_liq: I like the look of gnome. Kde is too messy looking.
[11:43] <nomin> php-freak, how old is your soundcard?
[11:43] <php-freak> probaly pretty old
[11:43] <php-freak> this laptop was made in
[11:43] <mnepton> php-freak: e.g. "Enable Plug And Play OS" in a BIOS worked fine with Windows. brought BeOS to its knees. what works for one OS in a BIOS may well not work for another.
[11:43] <php-freak> maybe like 3 yerars i think
[11:43] <bimberi> sinthetek: put the error and your sources.list on a pastebin
[11:44] <php-freak> mnepton: okay im going to restart, and what should I check the bios for?
[11:44] <divin> can u tell me how to perform dual boot with ubuntu and vista in grub .... it doesnt work here
[11:44] <nomin> php-freak,  3 years isn't too old at all.  I've had sound problems with computers that were about 8-10 years old.  I'm thinking that there's a way to get yours to work.  I've heard that sound stuff is different on laptops then desktops.
[11:45] <divin> can anyone help me with grub
[11:45] <divin> ??
[11:45] <renzo17> for the laptop sound problems, there are people who have had to apply the ALSA patch to the kernel to get it working
[11:45] <php-freak> nomin, : well what do you suggest I do?
[11:45] <php-freak> Should I check the bios out?
[11:46] <kolemp_> Re to all
[11:46] <sinthetek> blah, nm. i got it
[11:46] <bimberi> sinthetek: righto :)
[11:46] <nomin> php-freak, like what renzo17 just said, I've heard something similar about laptops before.  Some people need to change a line somewhere in the kernel.
[11:46] <sinthetek> i missed some stuff in between some of the weird characters this shell outputs sometimes
=== hantoo is now known as hantu
[11:46] <sinthetek> thanks though!
[11:46] <kolemp_> is there anyone who has winfast delux tuner?
[11:47] <php-freak> okay
[11:47] <php-freak> how do i get the alsa patch
[11:47] <KD-Misafir181> slm
[11:47] <KD-Misafir181> kanal
[11:47] <php-freak> should I just google it, or can i get it through the terminal
[11:47] <renzo17> google it, its probably on sourceforge
[11:47] <KD-Misafir181> trke bilen yokmu
[11:48] <php-freak> now what kind of files are usually brough through the terminal?
[11:48] <php-freak> confused on that one lol
[11:48] <nomin> php-freak, first of all, you need to confirm exactly what the problem is.
[11:48] <php-freak> before I go applying the patch
[11:48] <php-freak> Well I wont' know if I don't apply the patch
[11:48] <php-freak> let me restart really quick, and check out bios, and maybe it will work
[11:48] <battlesquid> how do i find out what ubuntu version i have? from command line(!)
[11:48] <php-freak> ill brb
[11:49] <z9999> Anyone know how to have a .profile executed automatically at login. It appears that ubuntu doesn't use a .profile in the users directory automatically.
[11:49] <bimberi> !version | battlesquid
[11:49] <ubotu> battlesquid: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[11:50] <MrGreen> Can I use laptop wireless to talk to my desktop ?
[11:50] <bimberi> z9999: .bash_profile is run (for bash shells anyway)
[11:51] <renzo17> yeah through a network you can MrGreen
[11:51] <battlesquid> bimberi, thanks. it appears i have 6.06. i have a problem, which is that i want to upgrade vim (i have ver 6.4.6, the newest is actually >7) but apt-get install vim says i have the latest version already installed! that's wrong tough. is that because i have an older ubuntu?
[11:51] <ShadeS> Hello
[11:51] <ShadeS> I registered this name, ages ago, Registered: 2 years 38 weeks 6 days (2h 2m 56s) ago
[11:51] <ShadeS> -
[11:52] <MrGreen> so I still need a router .. to connect the two?
[11:52] <ShadeS> but I forgot my pw, am I screwed?
[11:52] <ShadeS> MrGreen connect what?
[11:52] <MrGreen> latop --- desktop
[11:52] <nomin> is firefox 2 available with edgy?
[11:52] <ShadeS> hub/switch/router
[11:52] <MrGreen> *laptop
[11:52] <ShadeS> any will suffice
[11:52] <MrGreen> wireless
[11:52] <renzo17> not necessarily, i think you can use ssh or something but a router would be easier
[11:52] <ShadeS> in fact append crossover cable to the front of that list
[11:52] <ShadeS> you can use any of them, they increase in price
[11:52] <bimberi> battlesquid: yes.  Dapper's version of vim will only be updated as a security or major bug fix
[11:52] <MrGreen> cable defeats wireless route but yes that would work
[11:53] <ShadeS> oh
[11:53] <ShadeS> wireless
[11:53] <MrGreen> sorry yes
[11:53] <ShadeS> You might just have to use a router
[11:53] <ShadeS> unelss there are somne wireless switches I don't know about
[11:53] <MrGreen> ad-hoc maybe
[11:53] <ShadeS> i wouldn't touch that w/ a 10 ft pole
[11:53] <MrGreen> rofl
[11:53] <bimberi> battlesquid: there may be a backport, you can check on http://packages.ubuntu.com .  Otherwise you can compile it yourself.
[11:53] <gebruiker> how do I run fsck on boot once?
[11:53] <tea> hi
[11:54] <ShadeS> gebruiker do you know how to append the fsck cmd to your startup script?
[11:54] <battlesquid> bimberi, i see. that's a big problem for me as i need syntax highlighting. how can i upgrade my server to latest ubuntu without reinstalling?
[11:54] <MrGreen> soo configure lappy & box to talk via router ....
[11:54] <dwa> gebruiker, reboot 29 times ;)
[11:54] <mnepton> gebruiker: sudo touch /forcefsck
[11:54] <MrGreen> much safer
[11:54] <ShadeS> there's more than one way to skin a cat ;)
[11:54] <MrGreen> ok lol
[11:55] <concept10> Gosh .. thunar is so much faster than nautilus
[11:55] <Virogenesis> how do I find which repository has x-window-system ??? I can't get X windows to install thru apt-get :(((
[11:56] <frandavid100> would anyone know how to erase all my compiz settings from gconf and get the default settings back?
[11:56] <_greenie> was wondering if someone could help me with a windows XP/ubuntu dual boot, description of problems can be found here
[11:56] <_greenie> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=310379
[11:56] <frandavid100> I know there was some command for that, but don't remember what
[11:56] <bimberi> battlesquid: hmm, I would recommend keeping a server at Dapper really.  Compiling vim7 would be a better option imo.  However if you insist...
[11:57] <bimberi> !upgrade | battlesquid
[11:57] <ubotu> battlesquid: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:57] <mnepton> Virogenesis: sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg
[11:57] <php-freak> okay im back
[11:58] <php-freak> did not resolve issue
[11:58] <solid_liq> anyone know of a dvd ripping program that will utilize more than one proc?  I'm only getting ~35 fps with acidrip, and it's only using one of my two cpus
[11:58] <php-freak> maybe its the patch he was talking about
[11:58] <Jaak> i am trying to get grub to start windows from hd0,5 but it fails to do so...
[11:58] <Jaak> i fallowed the instructions
=== [1] bucky1 is now known as bucky1
[11:58] <ShadeS> only 35?
[11:58] <ShadeS> an aciddrip got me going 1000000fps+ ;)
[12:00] <php-freak> nomin, you there?
[12:00] <nomin> php-freak, yes
[12:02] <php-freak> nomin: you think I should try that patch?
[12:02] <nomin> php-freak, I don't have any experience with sound problems on a laptop.  I'm just going off of what I've heard before.  Someone mentioned something about changing a line in the kernel.
[12:02] <z9999> bimberi: Had to go feed the monkeys, Is .bash_profile a Linux substitute for .profile. I'm more used to Bell System unix systems, and sh or ksh.
[12:02] <php-freak> hmm how do I access the kernal?
[12:02] <php-freak> maybe I'll know once I get in there
[12:02] <mnepton> z9999: .bash_profile is specific to the shell. that's all.
[12:03] <A[D] minS> !grub
[12:03] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[12:03] <battlesquid> bimberi, hm yes you're right. how would i compile vim7 successfully
[12:03] <nomin> php-freak, you might have to be patient to get an answer from someone who knows more about your situation.  You should ask a question on ubuntuforums.org and wait for a response.
[12:04] <z9999> mnepton: We just want to set some variables for our own use, should that be where we place them in ubuntu?
[12:04] <mnepton> z9999: depends on your shell of choice.
[12:04] <z9999> mnepton: We are using bash.
[12:04] <mnepton> z9999: bash? zsh? tcsh? ksh?
[12:05] <bimberi> z9999: /etc/environment
[12:05] <mnepton> z9999: then .bash_profile is appropriate. and be sure to change the skel version so new users get the correct variables populated.
[12:05] <php-freak> okay sorry
[12:05] <nomin> php-freak, I choose 'advanced' in google and search ubuntuforms.org for my problems.  There is tons of information in the forums.  google is better at searching than forums than the sites own search enging, I think.
[12:05] <php-freak> true
[12:06] <php-freak> i like the terminal  I can open up all kinds of protcols under there
[12:06] <php-freak> this linux stuff isn't so bad
[12:06] <bimberi> battlesquid: I'm trying to find a good guide ...
[12:06] <nomin> php-freak, I have a feeling you'll never go back.
[12:06] <php-freak> nomin, lol why you say that for
[12:06] <z9999> mnepton & bimberi: OK, and thanks, will have to wait until tomorrow to try as the system is out now.
[12:07] <nomin> linux is getting better all the time.  Why use windows when a person can use linux?
[12:07] <battlesquid> bimberi, great
[12:07] <php-freak> Theres a few things I'm gettigng use to, but ill work that out like the display, and stuff. Yea, plus linux got more control, I think mainly programmers use linux
[12:07] <nomin> php-freak, I think regular shmucks are starting to use linux too.  I'm one of them.
[12:08] <php-freak> lol
[12:08] <php-freak> haha
[12:08] <php-freak> you don't write php, or anyththing?
[12:08] <nomin> I put ubuntu on a girls computer.  She loves it and isn't computer savvy at all
[12:08] <nomin> nope.  I've dabbled in programming stuff before but it's too much of a hassle for me.
[12:09] <nomin> I've learned a whole lot about computers since I started using linux though.
[12:09] <z9999> One more question, does anyone know where to find a printable version of the latest bash reference guide? Or is such a thing freely available? We're not in a populated area, so if it must be purchased we will have to wait until next trip to a city.
[12:09] <dreamer> but I get cross dependancy error from xmms2-core and xmms2-output
[12:10] <dreamer> how can I get a complete xmms install from this repository?
[12:10] <dreamer> xmms2*
[12:10] <nomin> php-freak, windows recently dropped support for all versions before xp.  Linux is a great way to bring older computers back to life.
[12:11] <dreamer> haha, sure is :)
[12:11] <nomin> all those older computers out there are potential linux boxes now
[12:11] <nomin> I've picked up some decent pc's off of people's laws before
[12:11] <php-freak> yea
[12:11] <nomin> *lawns
[12:11] <dreamer> haha
[12:12] <bimberi> battlesquid: OK, I found this page - http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Backport_VIM7 .  However I would use edgy sources rather than the ones shown there...
[12:12] <nomin> the best I've gotten so far is a 700 MHZ with 20Gig HD
[12:12] <dreamer> first I'ma build a media-pc for the livingroom, any advice an OS' ?
[12:12] <php-freak> nomin, : http://www.indianawebsitedesign.net tell me if my website is viewing fine over there, or if on the right the text is like overlapping?
[12:12] <php-freak> it didn't do this on windows
[12:13] <stefg> dreamer: happy to discuss that in #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:13] <dreamer> nomin: I just a 800mHz 512mb 6gb machine I want to build for that media-pc :)
[12:13] <dreamer> stefg: ok :)
[12:13] <nomin> dreamer, I installed mythtv successfully with mandriva.  I'm gonna try mythtv on ubuntu soon.
[12:13] <bimberi> battlesquid: nevermind, that's exactly what the page does (hadn't read it closely enough before posting)
[12:13] <HumanPrototype> tslinux doesnt seem to be meeting my needs as I cant see how to get it onto a CD
[12:14] <HumanPrototype> is there a way to make a cd that will install ubuntu server with xfce (no programs or anything) and tsclient then autologin and start tsclient?
[12:14] <nomin> php-freak, it's fine.
[12:14] <php-freak> see my screen has to be too big, or something
[12:14] <php-freak> lol
[12:14] <php-freak> ahh ill look at it later
[12:14] <nomin> php-freak, actually, on the right it is overlapping
[12:15] <nomin> sorry
[12:15] <nomin> just a little bit though
[12:15] <HumanPrototype> it doesnt even have to be xfce - blackbox/fluxbox would do
[12:15] <battlesquid> bimberi, nice, thank you!
[12:15] <bimberi> battlesquid: np, good luck with it :)
[12:15] <burwaco> I found a list with supported hardware on one of the ubuntu sites a few days ago, I'm wondering what module my ESS 18xx  should use...
=== acetoxy is now known as hcetoxy
[12:15] <nomin> php-freak, I fix that by pressing ctrl - to shrink the text in firefox
[12:16] <dreamer> nomin: we don't have kobel or anything, maybe 3 channels DVB-T in 2 months
[12:16] <battlesquid> bimberi, thanks :)
[12:16] <php-freak> nomin: yea its overlapping,
[12:17] <php-freak> hmm didn't do that on windows
[12:17] <nomin> php-freak, I've noticed that with firefox on linux and not on windows.
[12:17] <nomin> php-freak, it's just fine when I use explorer to view it.
[12:17] <php-freak> you have 2 os running at once?
[12:17] <php-freak> on 1 pc?
[12:17] <nomin> no, i used wine to emulate windows
[12:17] <php-freak> I see
[12:18] <nomin> i'll give a link to install wine...
[12:18] <php-freak> okay
[12:18] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok is there any way to find out what the ALT key is bound to in Xfce? I've got diablo 2 working with wine, but the alt+click thing doesn't work because alt is bound to something in the window manager. how do i figure out what it is and change it?
[12:18] <php-freak> do i do this through the terminal?
[12:18] <burwaco> does anyone know where the supported hardware list is on the ubuntu site ?
[12:18] <burwaco> the one with the modules
=== hcetoxy is now known as acetoxy
[12:18] <JoePits> anyone know how to get the prism2 usb adapters working through the package manager?
[12:19] <nomin> HOWTO Setup Wine  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=149585&highlight=wine  <======== by FAR the BEST wine installation instructions I've found.  Took me about 45 minutes for the whole process but it works.
[12:19] <bimberi> CoRnJuLiOx: xmodmap
[12:19] <JoePits> does ubuntu come with this linux-wlan
[12:19] <ShadeS> what was the defalut thing in diablo 2 for alt+click?
[12:19] <ShadeS> I forgot.
[12:19] <nomin> that page shows how to install explorer 6, media player 6, outlook also
[12:20] <ShadeS> I always just remapped my keys through D2 to make stuff work
[12:20] <ShadeS> less hassle.
[12:20] <nomin> I was able to install age of empires with this wine setup also
[12:20] <HumanPrototype> has anybody here ever tried modifying the ubuntu install cd?
[12:20] <CoRnJuLiOx> bimberi:ok, i see it, but how do i change it now?
[12:20] <nomin> dreamweaver 4 installed pretty well also
[12:20] <bimberi> CoRnJuLiOx: sorry, that I don't know :/
[12:21] <CoRnJuLiOx> nomin: have you tried warcraft III?
[12:21] <tc_75> i'm having pbs configuring my wifi connection, isn't there a utility to display available hotspots?
[12:21] <nomin> CoRnJuLiOx, I don't have that game.
[12:21] <nomin> CoRnJuLiOx, I've tried the cedega timedemo to insall other games and it looks like cedega works pretty well.
[12:21] <YoG> mnepton, are you still here?
[12:22] <rickyfingers> tc_75: sometimes the command iwlist <interface name> scanning will tell you what hotspots are out there
[12:22] <rickyfingers> tc_75: although not all wireless nics support the command
[12:22] <php-freak> whats the little red line that goes through ubuntu on xchat?
[12:22] <mnepton> YoG: eye yam
[12:22] <php-freak> like every so many lines i see a red line
[12:22] <rickyfingers> *tc_75: sometimes the command sudo  iwlist <interface name> scanning will tell you what hotspots are out there
[12:22] <nomin> I tried installing nero6 with wine and it lets me open up the media player but it won't play anything
[12:23] <defrysk> php-freak, markerline
[12:23] <defrysk> php-freak, to keep track of where you left off and came back
[12:23] <nomin> php-freak, you can turn that line off.  I think it's just there to show you what the last line you were at was when you open another app.
[12:23] <mnepton> nomin: why would you want Nero?
[12:23] <nomin> mnepton, to burn dvds
[12:24] <nomin> mnepton, I need to change formats and I already bought nero before I was using linux this much
[12:24] <nomin> mnepton, although nero is available for linux now.  I haven't tried it out yet.
[12:24] <YoG> mnepton - brb...
[12:24] <mnepton> nomin: change formats from what to what?
[12:24] <yuk> nomin: why not try gnomebaker
[12:25] <nomin> mnepton, from avi to mpeg in order to make dvds to play in dvd player.  I suppose I could learn to use programs that change formats and then use kino.
[12:25] <tc_75> rickyfingers: thx... checking it out...
[12:26] <nomin> I think kino only uses one video format.  I have to change mulitiple video formats into the one that's used on dvds.  Nero6 does that for me automatically.
[12:26] <defrysk> nomin, http://geocities.com/johanvrt/
[12:26] <php-freak> well thats not so bad the red line
[12:26] <php-freak> I love linux
[12:26] <php-freak> lol
[12:26] <defrysk> nomin, easy howto on yhe cli
[12:26] <defrysk> the*
[12:26] <YoG> mnepton: (sorry for the delay) i removed .gconf and .gconfd
[12:26] <php-freak> I figured it might come into use, im installing xampp now
[12:26] <php-freak> for php/mysql
[12:27] <nomin> ok, thanks defrysk
[12:27] <JoePits> anyone have success with the miniUSB adapters
[12:27] <JoePits> for wireless
[12:27] <defrysk> nomin, its a nobrainer really :)
[12:27] <JoePits> like the dlink dwl-122
[12:27] <php-freak> where is somewhere I can go to study all these commands for linux, under the terminal?so I know which command does what
[12:27] <defrysk> nomin, just install ffmpeg and dvdauthor
[12:27] <JoePits> http://www.linux-wlan.com/linux-wlan/index.html#Download
[12:27] <YoG> mnepton, the situation no is as follows: if i login gnome with networking it takes about ~3-5 minutes to login (from the greeter to the desktop) most of the time i see the brown screen. after which gnome starts ok (so it seems)
[12:28] <YoG> mnepton: if i start gnome without networking it starts just fine
[12:28] <YoG> mnepton: (no more than 20 secs.)
[12:28] <nomin> defrysk, actually, someone showed me how to convert flv to avi with ffmpeg not too long ago.  It really wasn't that hard.
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[12:29] <defrysk> nomin, not really hard indeed
[12:29] <knoppix> #exit
[12:29] <stefg> YoG: have you checked ifconfig if the 'lo' adapter is set up correctly?
[12:29] <nomin> than maybe I could have some files to work with to try out kino.
=== CarNagE__ is now known as Carnage\
[12:30] <YoG> stefg: I'll check, just a sec.

[12:33] <GuestD50BD1> hi I'm going to install ubuntu
[12:33] <php-freak> maybe its cause I need to put a clearer font on
[12:33] <renzo17> php-freak, i had that problem, have u installed the msfonts package?
[12:33] <php-freak> no
[12:33] <KenSentMe> philipsmith: go to system - preferences and standard applications (or something like that
[12:33] <kleftisx> hello how i can get updates for ubuntu?
[12:33] <barrett9h> what's the Xfce equivalent of ~/.gnomerc?
[12:33] <jmspeex> Is it possible to tell dpkg to just ignore a conflict and still allow me to do other stuff.
[12:33] <php-freak> renzo17: thats what it is
[12:33] <php-freak> how can i get the msfonts
[12:34] <KenSentMe> kleftisx: go to system - Administration and update manager
[12:34] <GuestD50BD1> will emule work?

[12:34] <renzo17> there is i dont know if its in synaptic but its definately easy to find on google.
[12:34] <jmspeex> I need kuickshow, which isn't packaged by Ubuntu, so I had to install the debian version and tell dpkg to ignore dependencies. Now dpkg refuses to do anything else until I remove kuickshow.
[12:34] <php-freak> now wheres it connecting to to get all this information, and what is sudo mean?
[12:34] <stefg> !info kuickshow
[12:34] <ubotu> Package kuickshow does not exist in any distro I know
[12:34] <philipsmith> KenSentMe: Thanks so much. I owe you a Coke!
[12:35] <renzo17> if that doesnt work then there is a thread in the ubuntuforums with a title called "blurry font" or something that helps solve it

[12:35] <php-freak> okay
[12:35] <php-freak> I see
[12:35] <php-freak> I use cd.. to go back a directory under terminal Right
[12:35] <bimberi> _greenie: To me, everything you're trying to do looks fine.  It could be a problem/bug with the installer.  If it's easy, try downloading the alternate CD and installing from it.
[12:35] <kleftisx> how sudo works?
[12:35] <udeafd> php-freak: not cd.. but cd ..
[12:36] <php-freak> I see got to watch that one :)

[12:36] <JoePits> or do i have to put the package on

[12:37] <JoePits> it already identifies it as a wired adapter but it wont work
[12:37] <bimberi> !ndiswrapper | JoePits
[12:37] <php-freak> well I tried installing the package, and it said Package msttcorefonts is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[12:37] <php-freak> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[12:37] <php-freak> is only available from another source
[12:37] <php-freak> E: Package msttcorefonts has no installation candidate
[12:37] <ubotu> JoePits: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs

[12:43] <udeafd> JoePits: sorry i have little time
[12:44] <KenSentMe> php-freak: is that what you try to do?
[12:44] <udeafd> JoePits: the card should work with the wlan-ng drivers
[12:44] <JoePits> so i just untar them or whatever
[12:44] <JoePits> is there an ubuntu package
[12:45] <udeafd> JoePits: there should be a package
[12:46] <JoePits> ok
[12:46] <php-freak> kensentme: let me check that out
[12:46] <php-freak> i know xampp supports linux too
[12:46] <php-freak> man i got to fix all these ugly fonts on here, and make stuff look more clearer
[12:46] <Corbeaux> what about xampp?
[12:47] <gOldZahN> hi folks! i've a big problem...i cant turn my screen resolution higher than 800x600 px. what can i do?
[12:48] <php-freak> Corbeaux: you know about xampp?
[12:48] <Corbeaux> basic stuff maybe
[12:49] <php-freak> okay well trying to install it, here let me show you
[12:49] <chaelot|work> is there any software for linux that can record desktop/on-screen stuff such as "Fraps" for win ?
[12:49] <php-freak> http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html
[12:49] <php-freak> Corbeaux, : see that link, I downloaded the package, but how do i do the rest?
[12:49] <tc_75> can't get wifi connection to work :S i have a usb key plugged in, my wifi router next to the computer and open to connections, iwlist sees it but i cant get it to connect

[12:49] <nomin> gOldZahN, Adding Screen Resolutions  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=157235
[12:49] <tc_75> can it be that my usb key isnt supported? even though it added itself to network devices and iwlist works
[12:49] <KenSentMe> php-freak: don't use it
[12:49] <php-freak> tar xvfz xampp-linux-1.5.5a.tar.gz -C /opt I tried running that at the terminal, but did not work
[12:50] <Corbeaux> extract it
[12:50] <KenSentMe> php-freak: it's best to only install packages from the ubuntu repos
[12:50] <rollfilm> does someone know a lightweight browser for gnome?
[12:50] <php-freak> xampp is good
[12:50] <php-freak> corbeaux: so just extract is?
[12:50] <php-freak> Well i went to the same directory and did the given syntax, but did not work
[12:50] <Corbeaux> xampp doesn't really install, it just puts all the binaries into a folder and you can run them from there without messing with the rest oif your configs
[12:52] <matason> If scp stalls is there anything I can do to tickle it back into life? :)
[12:52] <php-freak> I see
[12:52] <matason> I am moving files
[12:52] <php-freak> so basically I just extract them there
[12:52] <KenSentMe> php-freak: really, you should install it through synaptic. So use the pages ubotu sent you
[12:52] <php-freak> and they'll run
[12:52] <php-freak> kensentme: thats something else, it don't support phpmyadmin
[12:52] <KenSentMe> php-freak: yes it does
[12:52] <php-freak> Whats the link again

[12:52] <KenSentMe> php-freak: installing manually is a lot of work and probably it wont work after all
[12:52] <php-freak> kensentme: how can i fix this ugly font on my firefox, and everything else
[12:52] <Dimensions> matason: ... i mean in GUI ...
[12:52] <php-freak> just don't look clear enoough
[12:53] <KenSentMe> php-freak: install the msttcorefonts pacakge
[12:53] <matason> Dimensions: Ah OK - not sure about that - sorry :(
[12:53] <udeafd> Dimensions: install openssh-server and use places->connect to server->ssh in natilus file manager
[12:53] <dawkirst> Hi. What download manager is recommended in Ubuntu?
[12:53] <php-freak> can i get that from the terminal?
[12:53] <Dimensions> its lotsa data matason: can't  transfer all files via ssh ...
[12:53] <Dimensions> ummmmmmm...
[12:53] <Dimensions> thanks udeafd
[12:53] <KenSentMe> php-freak: sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
[12:53] <nomin> gOldZahN, this one is better:  Adding a higher screen resolution  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=657284
[12:54] <php-freak> says its not available
[12:54] <php-freak> says its missing, or been obsolete
[12:54] <KenSentMe> !info msttcorefonts
[12:54] <ubotu> msttcorefonts: Installer for Microsoft TrueType core fonts. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 22 kB, installed size 164 kB
[12:54] <KenSentMe> php-freak: it's in the multiverse repo so
[12:54] <php-freak> I type the following syntax in the terminal
[12:54] <nomin> php-freak, you may have to add more repositories
[12:54] <KenSentMe> !multiverse | php-freak
[12:54] <Dimensions> udeafd: is it possible that i connect a single cable from my one laptop to other one directly ???
[12:54] <matason> Ah I just press return and it resumes - nice :)
[12:54] <ubotu> php-freak: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[12:55] <udeafd> Dimensions: if it is a crosslink cable, yes
[12:55] <php-freak> do what now?
[12:55] <KenSentMe> php-freak: chech what ubotu said
[12:55] <php-freak> more repositories?
[12:55] <gOldZahN> oh thx nomin
[12:55] <php-freak> says package msttcoreofnts has no installion canditate
[12:55] <php-freak> only available from another sourcce
[12:55] <Dimensions> udeafd:  a cat 5 cable ?
[12:55] <matason> Dimensions: Yes
[12:55] <KenSentMe> php-freak: again, look at what ubotu says
[12:55] <matason> You need a crossover cable
[12:55] <udeafd> Dimensions: yes, but a crossover type
[12:56] <matason> It's like a normal Cat 5e cable but the wiring is slightly different
[12:56] <Dimensions> donno which one is crossover tobe honest but i have cat 5 cables used for LAN normally
[12:56] <udeafd> Dimensions: if you have gbit ethernet on both side, it can be a non-crossover too
[12:56] <php-freak> okay will this resolve why that ain't downloading?
[12:56] <Chash> hi all
[12:56] <nomin> php-freak, packages for ubuntu can come from any location.  Added a repository is just added another database of packages that you can download and install.
[12:56] <nomin> *is just adding
[12:56] <php-freak> I see
[12:56] <php-freak> where it downloading them from?
[12:56] <matason> Ah sorry - didn't realise udeafd had answered already :)
[12:56] <nikin> i have an Intel chipset based ac97 soundcard
[12:56] <nikin> and when i try to use skype
[12:57] <KenSentMe> php-freak: yes. you have to enable the multiverse repo. And how to do that is in the reply from ubotu
[12:57] <Dimensions> thanks matason...
[12:57] <nikin> it returns the voice of my partner to him
[12:57] <nikin> any ideas?
[12:57] <KenSentMe> php-freak: so read that first
[12:57] <nomin> php-freak, read the info on it.  You'll see where they come from.  You can add all kinds of repos if you know what you're doing.
[12:58] <matason> Dimensions: If you look up crossover cable on google you can see the colour order and compare your cables
[12:58] <HumanPrototype> nikin: is his mike picking up the sound from his speakers?
=== Utalom_a_windows is now known as Darth_Miki
[12:58] <matason> Dimensions: Basically you're looking for one that is not wired the same at both ends :)
[12:58] <php-freak> I see, but they want to charge :(
[12:58] <php-freak> they said that package is not free lol
[12:58] <nikin> Human: not, i ame using headphones, and bytheway if i listen to music that goes to him to
[12:59] <Dimensions> sounds the same ... i just checked ...
[12:59] <nop> anybody in UCLA?
[12:59] <nomin> php-freak, non-free means something different
[12:59] <nikin> so somehow the master or the PCM is returned
[12:59] <nomin> php-freak, it has to do with copyright or proprietary stuff or something like that.  Just enable them.
[12:59] <nop> anybody in UCLA???

[01:04] <nomin> he says he only has one option
[01:05] <gOldZahN> but what is my problem?^^
[01:06] <jmspeex> I need kuickshow, which isn't packaged by Ubuntu, so I had to install the debian version and tell dpkg to ignore dependencies. Now dpkg refuses to do anything else until I remove kuickshow. Can anyone help?
[01:06] <nomin> what is the command similar to xorgconfig for ubuntu?
[01:08] <burwaco> is there anyone here who can help me set up my soundcard ? it's not detected i think...
[01:08] <nomin> gOldZahN, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:08] <nomin> gOldZahN, that should let you set up your monitor
[01:09] <gOldZahN> nomin, yeah i tried it. i had to tyoe the root's pass but then the terminal disappeared
[01:09] <arob> hi, i get the following error "C compiler cannot create executables" while compiling dovecot source.
[01:10] <arob> any idea? how could i fix this error?
[01:10] <nomin> gOldZahN, you didn't go through the process of configuring it?  Also, it does look like it can change resolutions.
[01:10] <nomin> gOldZahN, does pressing "control alt +" at the same time do anything?
[01:11] <nomin> press it again to change it again
[01:11] <gOldZahN> nomin, when shall i press it?
[01:11] <nomin> now
[01:12] <gOldZahN> nomin, ok....no reaction
[01:12] <bimberi> arob: install build-essential
[01:13] <gOldZahN> nomin, you mean i forgot to configure my hardware in the installation of ubuntu?
[01:14] <nomin> gOldZahN, I see now.  I have the same problem.  It hasn't bothered me because I use 1024*768
[01:15] <nomin> I only have the option in the menu for 2 resolutions while my xorg says I have more
=== ShadeS is now known as ShadoWindNinj4
[01:16] <gOldZahN> nomin, so the option window just take the 2 smallest options from xorg.conf, right?
[01:16] <nomin> not for me.  it picked the biggest and the smallest.
[01:16] <nomin> and I can only use 75 refresh rate, while my monitor is actually 50-60
[01:17] <gOldZahN> nomin, so i could try do delete the resolutions i dont need in xorg.conf?
[01:18] <ShadoWindNinj4> backup first 8 D
[01:18] <nomin> I wouldn't do that yet.  I'm looking stuff up...
[01:18] <nomin> How to set you monitor resolution  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=269052
[01:18] <nomin> that might help

[01:22] <arob> bimberi: thank you. its now working
[01:22] <elsebasb1> could drivers be the problem?
[01:23] <Jowi> elsebasb1, define "movie" is it an avi or dvd?
[01:24] <Jowi> elsebasb1, and what player are you using?
[01:24] <elsebasb1> Jowi: vlc
[01:24] <elsebasb1> even now, when I don't play anything, Xorg uses 14% cpu
[01:24] <Jowi> elsebasb1, define "movie" is it an avi or dvd?
[01:24] <elsebasb1> dvd, .iso
[01:25] <elsebasb1> The world is not enough :>
[01:25] <Jowi> elsebasb1, you experience the same with other players?

[01:28] <porkpie> how do I false an install of mysql-server not version5
[01:28] <bimberi> arob: cool
[01:29] <Jowi> elsebasb1, with mplayer you can specify different video outputs. "mplayer -vo xv filename.avi" for example
[01:30] <bimberi> porkpie: mysql-server-4.1 is available
[01:30] <porkpie> thanks
[01:30] <elsebasb1> Jowi: k, did that but still the same
[01:31] <Jowi> elsebasb1, perhaps a video driver issue. what hardware do you have?
[01:31] <elTigre> what is  the recommended version of python for edgy? 2.4 or 2.5?
[01:31] <elsebasb1> Jowi: Radeon X800

[01:31] <Jowi> elsebasb1, and you use the correct driver?

[01:38] <jrib> elTigre: are you using the repositories?
[01:38] <finalbeta> Jaak, Can't remember what the name was, but it's been discontinued, Feisty should have a proper replacement, I recommend using gparted.

[01:38] <elTigre> libglitz is installed correctly as far as I know
[01:39] <Jowi> elsebasb1, yeah. this page is for you https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[01:39] <Jaak> finalbeta, i am using gparted but i don't understand how i can mount stuff with it...
[01:39] <bimberi> Jaak: iirc it's part of gnome-system-tools, which is still in Edgy but just doesn't have Disks Admin in Edgy's version

[01:39] <ubotu> AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers.

[01:39] <Jowi> elsebasb1, be sure to follow the guide for your ubuntu version
[01:39] <elTigre> what repositories?
[01:40] <finalbeta> Jaak, ah right, my fault, you are right. Try to use fstab :p. sudo gedit /etc/fstab , set the partitions manual.
[01:40] <JoePits> k guys im going to install windows 98SE now
[01:40] <elsebasb1> Jowi: I did what it said in your first link, and I had the correct drivers
[01:40] <elTigre> I don't use any old or non-standard ones
[01:40] <elsebasb1> Jowi: should I go with this guide too anyway?
[01:40] <jrib> elTigre: ok.  What does  'file /usr/lib/libglitz.so.1'  say?
[01:40] <Jaak> finalbeta, thanks
[01:40] <finalbeta> !fstab
[01:40] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file lists all drives and partitions that are mounted on the system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions

[01:41] <elsebasb1> Jowi: nope
[01:41] <elTigre> ImportError: /usr//lib/libcairo.so.1: undefined symbol: glitz_find_similar_drawable_format
[01:41] <Jowi> elsebasb1, so your drivers are not correctly installed
[01:41] <elTigre> that's the error that comes from having glitz installed
[01:42] <elsebasb1> Jowi: ok, i go for it :)
[01:42] <Jaak> bimberi, can i still get the admin, can you tell me the package name?

[01:44] <elTigre> I don't really need cairo or glitz, I just want to run pygtk programs
[01:44] <Jaak> now what, i have to go back to configure it manually using fstab? No other solution?
[01:45] <jrib> elTigre: interesting, I don't even have /usr/lib/libcairo.so.1
[01:45] <bimberi> Jaak: the executable was /usr/bin/disks-admin and it's part of (Dapper's) gnome-system-tools package
[01:45] <derFlo> would you use apache  or apache2?
[01:45] <eilker> is there any difference between "sudo su" and "su"
[01:45] <jrib> eilker: you shouldn't use the first one, use 'sudo -i

[01:46] <JuJuBee> I need assistance with copying a CD.  I have some games on CD for my kids and the CD is for Win/Mac both.  When I insert into Win, I only see Win installer, and likewise for Mac.  How can I copy this CD?
[01:46] <eilker> jrib: any difference between both ?
[01:46] <derFlo> would you use apache  or apache2?
[01:47] <joca> hello
[01:47] <elTigre> jrib: mhhh it's very strange
[01:47] <elTigre> I also checked /usr/local/
[01:48] <jrib> eilker: yes, one runs su and the other runs su through sudo.  So the first would ask for your sudo password and the second would ask for your root password (you don't have one set by default since ubuntu prefers sudo).  You really should do 'su -' instead since it resets env vars.  The equivalent to 'sudo su -' is 'sudo -i'.  This is preferred
[01:48] <joca> hello did ubuntu suport dual procesor pc
[01:48] <bimberi> eilker: one (sudo su) is running su as root, and the other (su) is running it as the user
[01:48] <bimberi> joca: it does
[01:48] <jrib> elTigre: dpkg -S /usr/lib/libcairo.so.1
[01:49] <jrib> ubotu: tell eilker about sudo
[01:49] <vinyl> can anybody help me in between of ubuntu and firewall? : )

[01:50] <eilker> jrib: i installed vmware server, in guide, it was telling use "sudo su" i just used "su" now it doesnt accept my username and password
[01:50] <jrib> eilker: like I said, 'su' asks for your root password.  Ubuntu doesn't use this by default

[01:54] <McMadd> I need to have a system configured to be always on (display). I set this in Power Management but it doesn't work. The system's bios seem to have no settings at all for this. Any suggestions?
[01:55] <jrib> nbs: are they sites that use flash?
[01:55] <nbs> propably yes jrib
[01:55] <elTigre> 2.10.3-0ubuntu3 both installed and available

[01:55] <php-freak> hey guys wheres the multiverse software at? I can't find it, and im at the ubuntu/compponets page, cause I'm needing to get the msfonts
[01:56] <jrib> elTigre: k, I'm trying to figure out why it is looking for /usr/lib/libcairo.so.1 at all
[01:56] <manmadha> hee have a look at this......how this site is working..?http://www.ufaq.org/banned.php
[01:56] <gestapo> I have kubuntu installed, but want to switch to ubuntu, how do I do that?
[01:56] <r00t_> hey pplz . how do i compile cpp file ?
[01:56] <manmadha> r00k, by gcc
[01:56] <NullP01nt3r> hello any easy way of encrypting/decrypting backups without using gpg?
[01:57] <Tomcat_> gestapo: Installing "ubuntu-desktop" *should* work.
[01:57] <duckman0> can sombody tell me how to set up duel monitors with ati flgrx drivers installed?
[01:57] <manmadha> NullP01nt3r, u may write the encription code...
[01:57] <jrib> r00t_: g++ -o program_name file.cc    where program_name is the name you want it to have after being compiled and file.cc is the name of the file with the c++ source code
[01:57] <gestapo> Tomcat, do I need to uninstall kubuntu-desktop first, and do I use synaptic for this?
[01:57] <manmadha> jrib, i think file.c
[01:57] <duckman0> itsent there a command to bring up a graphical interface?
[01:58] <r00t_> tnx :D jrib  :D
[01:58] <NullP01nt3r> manmadha, how is that?
[01:58] <McMadd> I need to have a system configured to be always on (display). I set this in Power Management but it doesn't work. The system's bios seem to have no settings at all for this. Any suggestions?
[01:58] <elTigre> jrib: I don't know... I just recently updated from dapper to edgy... and since that time it' broken
[01:58] <ailean> gestapo, install ubuntu-desktop from synaptic
[01:58] <nbs> jrib do u have any suggestions?
[01:58] <ailean> gestapo, no, you just install it
[01:58] <jrib> nbs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911 try the workaround here
[01:58] <ailean> gestapo, then you should be able to select between gnome and kde from the login screen
[01:59] <ailean> gestapo, if kde works as you want, you can then uninstall gnome
[01:59] <manmadha> NullP01nt3r, i cant tell the entire prog...But i will give u the hint..."Put the letters in an array....& if the letter A comes then u may put array[6] ...this is simple logic
[01:59] <gestapo> Ha, I'm installing ubuntu at work today...infiltrating the enemy!!!
[01:59] <_greenie> bimberi: so i should create a /media instead of a /home? but what file system do i use so that its valid between windows AND ubuntu?
[01:59] <jrib> elTigre: was ubuntu-desktop installed when you upgraded?  does 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' ask you to do anything now?
[02:00] <duckman0> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1773544 <--- what do i do after i copied the code in?
[02:00] <manmadha> have a look at this...  http://www.ufaq.org/banned.php
[02:00] <manmadha> how this site is working?
[02:00] <gestapo> thanx

[02:01] <manmadha> jrib, he u know the functioning of this site....?  http://www.ufaq.org/banned.php
[02:01] <bimberi> _greenie: ah sorry, i have misunderstood your question.  If your creating a partition, the preferred type is fat32 as it provides read/write to both.  My samba answer was if you had two computers (1 win, 1 linux) on a network sharing data.
[02:02] <gestapo> well, they only have windows on site here, so this is the first linux box!
[02:02] <ailean> gestapo, good good
[02:02] <jrib> manmadha: if you google 'ip address php', 'host address php', 'useragent php' you'll probably get better explanations
[02:02] <duckman0> how do i split the screen between two monitors? HELP ME!
[02:03] <gestapo> so, not really infiltrating the enemy, but at least getting a shot at it
[02:03] <gestapo> cheers

[02:31] <php-freak> and trying to gain root acess
[02:31] <php-freak> okay
[02:31] <Condorcet> then passwd will create password for root

[02:31] <Condorcet> after that u can log on as 'root' and a new password
[02:31] <udeafd> php-freak: just put sudo before the command you want to run as root. whats so difficult about it?
[02:31] <coz_> php-freak, type this in   sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:33] <php-freak> okay I see how it works now
[02:33] <coz_> php-freak, now what is it youwant to edit in the xorg file/
[02:33] <php-freak> so everytime I want to change something I have to use the sudo
[02:33] <Condorcet> php-freak, they are right - u dont have to use root account
[02:33] <php-freak> disable the labtop mouse
[02:33] <php-freak> the sensor
[02:33] <Condorcet> sudo is safe
[02:33] <coz_> php-freak, mostly there may be times you will have to be root , but you have to create a root password and a few settings
[02:34] <php-freak> i thought maybe i could log in as someone with all privilages at all times
[02:34] <udeafd> php-freak: no. thats a bad idea.
[02:34] <coz_> php-freak, you can as root but that is not always wise if  youare the onlyuser on the system
[02:34] <jinxedd> can i play games
[02:34] <jinxedd> in ubuntu
[02:34] <coz_> php-freak, but we can get you a rot password now if you like
[02:35] <zealan> what was the command to reconfigure xwindows? i upgraded my comp and it gives "no screens found"

[02:35] <php-freak> $synclient TouchpadOff=1
[02:35] <Condorcet> jinxedd, priv me for details
[02:35] <php-freak> how would I run that line i got that off of
[02:35] <php-freak> http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/03/24/disable-synaptics-touchpad/
[02:35] <coz_> php-freak, hold on let me look
[02:35] <php-freak> k
[02:36] <coz_> php-freak, what that link is telling  you is to open the xorg file and look for the   Section  that is called    Section "InputDevice"
[02:36] <Condorcet> jinxedd, there are many games but of course most windows games dont have linux versions
[02:36] <Kayiin> Oh man, I need to find some more DVDs to back up my files before I move to Ubuntu permanently.
[02:36] <Condorcet> there are some most popular ones - quake, neverwinternights etc
[02:36] <Kayiin> Curse this 40GB hard drive.
[02:37] <coz_> php-freak, if it is not in the xorg file then simply copy and paste that section into it
[02:37] <Kayiin> I've already used Ubuntu on my laptop for a while now and I'm really loving it.
[02:37] <php-freak> alread did that
[02:37] <Kayiin> This is going to be great.
[02:37] <php-freak> but where would I run the following syntax at
[02:37] <php-freak> $synclient TouchpadOff=1
[02:37] <php-freak> that?
[02:37] <coz_> php-freak, open the terminal and just type that in
[02:37] <php-freak> I did
[02:38] <php-freak> says command not found
[02:38] <coz_> php-freak, did you save the xorg file with the changes you makde/
[02:38] <coz_> made
[02:38] <php-freak> well duh
[02:38] <coz_> php-freak, lol
[02:38] <coz_> you never know
[02:38] <coz_> php-freak, did you reboot
[02:39] <php-freak> I have to reboot first?
[02:39] <coz_> php-freak,  it would be wise HOWEVER
[02:39] <php-freak> i don't see having to reboot for it to work, but let me try it
[02:39] <zealan> umh. how do you reconfigure xserver after changing a display card? was it dpkg something...?
[02:39] <coz_> php-freak, if you do reboot and you cannot get into ubuntu then you will have to remove the section you cpied and pasted in xorg
[02:40] <coz_> php-freak, WAIT!!
[02:40] <coz_> oh boy!

[03:22] <burwaco> I installed fglrx instead of the open source ones, but now glxgears even performs worse...
[03:22] <jrib> MartySkitch: you can't do that afaik.  The file system only keeps track of ctime, atime, mtime,  change, access, modified.  (man 2 stat has the details if you are interested) or just google for the three terms together.  The only think i can think of is that some files like OOo files, may have metadata that stores the time of creation.  In that case, I don't know how you would search for that

[03:23] <neemz> on startup the machine pauses for 30 seconds after SCSI subsystem initilized
[03:23] <soundray> neemz: one way to explore problems like that is to get a live CD with a later kernel, e.g. Knoppix, and see if that has drivers/ solves the problems you're experiencing.
[03:23] <neemz> if I set acpi=off it doesn't stop
[03:23] <DARKGuy> MoXoM: The way -I- make folders is creating them with sudo and then chmodding them 777. However that's 'cause I'm the only one using this PC and don't like to mess with user groups and all that heck

[03:25] <DARKGuy> MoXoM: Ah, I see, then I guess you should ask how to set the folder permissions both in chmod and the fstab so it's more secure (since it's gonna be a webserver...)

[03:27] <tombs> Unimatrix9: almere. en je?
[03:27] <DARKGuy> MoXoM: You just have to give the folder access only to your user and in the fstab too. Once that's done, you're set
[03:27] <zch> ordinary 100mbit network adapter, want me to check exact model?
[03:27] <Unimatrix9> tilburg
[03:27] <zch> i just bought it in the store
[03:28] <MoXoM> DARKGuy: no okay... i can understand that... hmm but there must be somewhere on the internet i can read about all that stuff about ubuntu and folder options and so on... right?
[03:28] <tombs> 013
[03:28] <Unimatrix9> :P
[03:28] <zch> and yes i forgot the -a
[03:28] <Unimatrix9> ver uit elkaar
[03:28] <kmaynard> zch, that's ok...it should work
[03:28] <r00t_> pppd: In file /etc/ppp/peers/gp: unrecognized option '/dev/rfcomm0'
[03:28] <r00t_>  . i got problem with this
[03:28] <zch> eth0, lo, sit0
[03:28] <MoXoM> and how the h*ll do i do that?:O
[03:28] <DARKGuy> MoXoM: I think so, tried www.ubuntuguide.or? there must be some chhmod stuff in there I think
[03:28] <Kayiin> Ah, Nederlanders.
[03:28] <r00t_> litile help here
[03:28] <Kayiin> Hoe is het?
[03:28] <Unimatrix9> hehe
[03:28] <soundray> zch: anything from 'dmesg | grep eth1'?
[03:28] <DARKGuy> MoXoM *www.ubuntuguide.org
[03:28] <Unimatrix9> the dutch rule!
[03:28] <MoXoM> DARKGuy: yeah okay, ill try that...  hehe
[03:29] <zch> soundray nope
[03:29] <tombs> lol
[03:29] <Kayiin> Ofcourse.
[03:29] <Kayiin> ^_^
[03:29] <zch> could it be hardware conflict?
[03:29] <kmaynard> what is sit0?
[03:29] <zch> maybe change pci slot?
[03:29] <soundray> zch: is there a line in 'lspci' that corresponds to it?
[03:29] <raavi> Can anyone send kernel .config file, which come with Edgy..to me...

[03:29] <rmbl> you lost your own one raavi ?
[03:29] <rmbl> :)
[03:30] <MoXoM> hehe im sitting here and thinking about how easy it was in windows hehe... but know i would try something else than windows
[03:30] <MoXoM> ooops
[03:30] <Kayiin> Oh lawd.
[03:30] <MoXoM> but no*
[03:30] <soundray> zch: which one is the new one?
[03:30] <Kayiin> A friend of mine deleted his grub folder.
[03:30] <DARKGuy> MoXoM: It isn't too hard either :) just gotta know the chmod parameters and what to put in fstab, and I don't know that :(
[03:30] <zch> lol let me see
[03:30] <raavi> rmbl: yeah,
[03:30] <rmbl> wow :D
[03:30] <rmbl> give me your mail and i send you mine ..
[03:31] <rmbl> should be the original one ..
[03:31] <MoXoM> DARKGuy:  no okay... if i find out of it, ill come back to ya and explaine it to ya ;)
[03:31] <rmbl> at least for some more minutes (compiling 2.6.19 atm)
[03:31] <raavi> rmbl: mohindar@hotmail.com
[03:31] <DARKGuy> MoXoM: Thanks a lot xD
[03:31] <borg> is there an ubuntu DVD i can download for version 6.10?
[03:31] <MoXoM> hehe yw
[03:31] <DARKGuy> MoXoM: you too :p
[03:31] <raavi> rmbl: thanks buddy.
[03:32] <soundray> zch: if you do a 'dmesg | less', then search (hit '/')for the string 'eth0', that should give you an indication
[03:32] <zch> ok let me try that
[03:32] <MoXoM> aargh christ... okay i wanna make the folder in / ... so should i type mkdir /disk1 ?
[03:32] <tom47> borg http://nginyang.uvt.nl/
[03:32] <rmbl> raavi: your kernel is the 2.6.17-10 one?
[03:32] <Jowi> kmaynard, probably a ipv4 in pv6 tunnel. think it is only used when ipv6 is enabled
[03:32] <Unimatrix9> that next door
[03:32] <kmaynard> MoXoM, if you wanna put it in /  you'll probably need sudo
[03:32] <rmbl> + -368
[03:32] <rmbl> ..
[03:32] <Unimatrix9> uvt, is my neighbour
[03:32] <soundray> zch: btw, don't paste in the channel please. There's a pastebin for that.
[03:32] <Unimatrix9> hehe
[03:32] <zch> eth0 is the realtek one
[03:32] <zch> ok sorry about that
[03:32] <raavi> rmbl: that is right, the generic one.
[03:33] <kmaynard> Jowi, thanks :) i googled after i blurted...
[03:33] <soundray> zch: okay, so let's first check if the via-rhine driver is loaded.
[03:33] <rmbl> sent ..
[03:33] <MoXoM> well isn't the best place to put a folder... or a harddisk in this case
[03:33] <raavi> rmbl: okay... :)
[03:33] <MoXoM> or should it be in admin?
[03:33] <zch> how do i do that
[03:33] <MoXoM> as my name is hehe
[03:33] <kmaynard> MoXoM, depends on what it'sfor
[03:33] <soundray> zch: 'lsmod | grep via-rhine'
[03:33] <zch> nothing happens
[03:33] <borg> tom47: thank you, sir
[03:34] <we2by> how do u play .ogm file?
[03:34] <Well_R2> Well_R changenick
=== Well_R2 is now known as Well_R
[03:34] <soundray> zch: okay. Try 'modprobe via-rhine', then 'ifconfig -a' again.
[03:34] <MoXoM> well... i was thinking about to get the apache installed on it with php, sql and so on... so i would use the harddisk as an "aplication disk"
[03:34] <Well_R> http://pastebin.com/836874
[03:34] <jrib> borg: http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/releases/6.10/release/ as well
[03:34] <soundray> zch: sorry 'sudo modprobe via-rhine', then 'ifconfig -a' again.
[03:34] <MoXoM> but i dont even know if it is possible to install things on another disk drive?
[03:34] <zch> ok
[03:34] <Unimatrix9> i wonder what an ogm file is...:P
[03:34] <Jowi> MoXoM, it is more common to mount devices (virtual or real ones) in /mnt or /media
[03:34] <kmaynard> MoXoM, then you should mount the other drive as /usr and/or /var
[03:35] <r00t_> wow its works
[03:35] <zch> soundray: done, still only eth0
[03:35] <Unimatrix9> should mplayer not play it?
[03:35] <MoXoM> hmm okay... and can you tell me why i should do that? :)
[03:35] <tom47> borg the url from jrib is better i think
[03:35] <soundray> zch: 'dmesg | tail -n 20' -- does that reveal any messages/errors?
[03:35] <jinxedd> so much of trouble in linux
[03:35] <jinxedd> lol
[03:36] <borg> tom47: do they offer a better download speed than 400KB/s ?
[03:36] <Unimatrix9> it beats sudoku ...LOL
[03:36] <tom47> < has no idea
[03:36] <zch> soundray: http://pastebin.ca/263408
[03:36] <jrib> borg: just check the md5sum of your file with the one from the ubuntu site
[03:36] <r00t_> how do i disable lan card?
[03:37] <Jowi> r00t_, easiest is to use "network-admin"
[03:38] <MoXoM> omg if kmaynard is answering my question, it is going to be long hehe
[03:38] <r00t_> Jowi,  where is it ?
[03:38] <soundray> zch: okay. It loads the driver, but still doesn't recognize the hardware. Let's think why...
[03:38] <Jowi> r00t_, type it in a terminal
[03:38] <zch> soundray: thanks a lot, I really appreciate this
[03:38] <soundray> zch: please paste the output of 'cat /proc/interrupts'
[03:38] <zch> ok
[03:39] <soundray> zch: thank me once we've achieved something...
[03:39] <borg> jrib: the both sites sport the same MD5's
[03:39] <setuid> How do I add Xv support to the X.org that Edgy ships?
[03:39] <zch> soundray: http://pastebin.ca/263411 and i thank you for trying
[03:39] <setuid> Apparently it lacks Xv support (sayeth xine)
[03:39] <jrib> borg: you should check the manually, but that sounds good then
[03:40] <borg> i'm not gonna download two isos for nothing
[03:41] <tom47> borg just download from the site you prefer but check the md5 sum of the iso against that provided by the ubuntu site
[03:41] <xi_> hi
[03:41] <xi_> is anybody using xchat?
[03:41] <tom47> as suggested by jrib
[03:42] <kmaynard> MoXoM, dont get your hopes up :)
[03:42] <borg> tom47: i see now, your explanation makes more sense, i know what you mean now
[03:42] <MoXoM> lol hehe
[03:42] <soundray> zch: I think you have an interrupt problem. Two approaches to that: 1) go into your BIOS setup and look for an option to reset or auto-set your ESCD data. If you can activate that, boot again and try 'ifconfig -a' once more.
[03:42] <reverseblade> I don't want my X to run when I reboot what can I do ?
[03:42] <soundray> zch: 2) if that doesn't help, reseat your new card to a different PCI slot.
[03:42] <zch> soundray: ok let me try
[03:42] <rjg_> #ubuntu-women
[03:42] <reverseblade> I want to login to terminal directly
[03:43] <soundray> zch: I would normally expect it to be at least recognized out of the box.
[03:43] <MoXoM> but kmaynard why should i put it in usr or var?.... there must be a reason :)
[03:43] <SMiTTY> <- new Ubuntu user...WoW, very nice...Everything worked outta the box. I thought I'd try Ubuntu after mucking with Gentoo and Debian for a couple days and never could get the wireless and SATA stuff working. Gentoo worked for the most part, Debian wouldn't even install. Very happy to be running Ubuntu now!
[03:43] <soundray> zch: when you've done that, come and ask again for help with IP config etc.
[03:43] <zch> soundray: ok, btw i have nothing but video card, and 2 network adapters in that machine
[03:43] <neemz> woot getting the i386 version of the iso at 1051kb/s :p
[03:44] <zch> let me check bios, gotta disconnect keyboard (only one keyboard :S)
=== user__ is now known as admin123
[03:45] <Lukian> What applications can I use to convert 4cc content (avi) to DVD?
[03:46] <Skwid_> hum ... everything was working fine, and now my fat32 partition is mounted as a read only file system
[03:46] <Skwid_> what could be the problem ?
[03:46] <BioGeek> Hello, I did a distro upgrade to Ubuntu 6.10 and now my Alt Gr key has stopped working. What can the cause of that be?
[03:46] <Skwid_> my /etc/fstab looks like it used to look
[03:47] <BioGeek> So I can't type 'at', 'backslash', etc.
[03:47] <Lukian> Skwid_, dmesg have any useful output for you?
[03:47] <carld> what does the packages.freecontrib.org repo provide?  I get key errors and wonder why I need it at all
[03:47] <BioGeek> I have a Belgian keyboard if that helps.
[03:48] <Skwid_> Lukian: indeed it appears to have !
[03:48] <tom47> doesn't seem like it helps at all ;-)
[03:48] <jrib> carld: it is/was PLF.  Stuff like w32codecs was available from PLF
[03:48] <Skwid_> Lukian: i have a whole bunch of this:
[03:48] <Skwid_> [17179715.904000]      fat_get_cluster: invalid cluster chain (i_pos 58152577)
[03:48] <Skwid_> [17179715.904000]  FAT: Filesystem panic (dev hda5)
[03:49] <nolimitsoya> does anyone know of a reasonaly cheap, non resampling, asio compatible, ac3-passthrough soundcard with optical output for use with ubuntu and mythtv?
=== user__ is now known as admin123
[03:49] <Lukian> scandisk / chkdsk time, not sure what the equivilent ubuntu / linux utility is :P
[03:49] <jrib> carld: http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf/
[03:49] <Skwid_> Lukian: hum, i have nothing on chkdsk
[03:50] <Skwid_> Lukian: what else can i use to share with windows easily ?
[03:50] <Lukian> There are ext / reiser drivers for windows, I haven't tested them to see how good they are
[03:50] <Well_R> hmm.. was that ban or unban?
[03:51] <LjL> unban
[03:51] <Lukian> removes
[03:51] <LadyNikon> LjL: how many times does that get full a day
[03:51] <LadyNikon> Well_R: -b = unban
[03:51] <VSpike> How can I find out which package provides a specific file?
[03:51] <LjL> it does not get "full", we just clean our bans periodically
[03:51] <Lukian> Skwid_, hmm, I personally use my NTFS partitions intentionally in read-only.
[03:51] <Well_R> okido
[03:51] <tom47> Skwid one alternative is to use vmware server/player instead of dual booting .... much more convenient as you can have both windows and ubuntu running at the same time and you can use samba to see the files on each
[03:51] <LjL> Ubotu, tell VSpike about apt-file | VSpike, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:51] <LadyNikon> LjL: ah
[03:51] <Skwid_> Lukian: yeah i need writing :(
[03:51] <kaptengu> how can I list the UUID of a partition?
[03:51] <Lukian> (I'm converting fully over to reiserfs4 soon however, I rarely boot to windows)
[03:52] <LjL> !uuid | kaptengu
[03:52] <ubotu> kaptengu: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[03:52] <Skwid_> tom47: hum, i'll look into that
[03:52] <VSpike> LjL: sweet..thanks
[03:52] <Lukian> 01:55:28 up 9 days,  3:56,  2 users,  load average: 0.59, 0.49, 0.43
[03:52] <Skwid_> Lukian: what command should i use to check my disk ?
[03:52] <kaptengu> LjL: thanks
[03:52] <Lukian> Skwid_, let me see if i can find something for that :)
[03:52] <tom47> sKwid fschk
[03:53] <Skwid_> tom47: thank you, should i specify the hard drive and/or partition to that ?
[03:53] <Lukian> man fschk isn't your friend?
[03:53] <burwaco> I installed fglrx instead of the open source ones, but now glxgears even performs worse...
[03:53] <tom47> skwid let me look at the deatil first
[03:53] <Lukian> You'd probably have better luck with ntfs (given the new support for it in linux now) -- fat used to die for me all the time in windows :p
[03:54] <reverseblade> Skwid_, do you need writing to your ntfs parition ?
[03:54] <reverseblade> parition
[03:54] <reverseblade> partition
[03:54] <tom47> skwid btw its fsck not fschk
[03:54] <Skwid_> reverseblade: no, just my fat32
[03:54] <Skwid_> tom47: yeah i figured that out :)
[03:54] <tuxub> how can I create a certificate for evolution?
[03:54] <reverseblade> well, I don't know fat32 but you can write to NTFS with NTFS-3g, it is safe and working fine
[03:54] <VSpike> Skwid_:  I don't think you can check ntfs partitions from linux, if that's what you're trying to do
[03:54] <Lukian> VSpike, learn2read
[03:55] <Skwid_> VSpike: nope :)
[03:55] <nolimitsoya> Skwid_, ext2/3 is fine for windows compatibility. theres ext2ifs for windows
[03:55] <reverseblade> !ntfs-3g
[03:55] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[03:55] <tom47> skwid looks to me, after looking back at yr problem that you should be looking at fat32 issues from windows as easiest route
[03:55] <Lukian> Skwid_,  what nolimitsoya said, other than that, is upgrading to ntfs an option?
[03:55] <aleswy> ntfs-3g on 64 bits?
[03:55] <Skwid_> nolimitsoya: i have to use a program to see my ext2fs file tho, right ?
[03:56] <nolimitsoya> Skwid_, with ext2ifs you mount them as you do any partition, and they are accessible with a drive letter through explorer
[03:56] <Skwid_> Lukian: sure ... but i originally moved all my files from ntfs to fat32 so that i could share them :(
[03:56] <Skwid_> nolimitsoya: oh, ok
[03:56] <Lukian> Skwid_, http://www.fs-driver.org/
[03:56] <nolimitsoya> Skwid_, id preffer ext2 in windows over ntfs in linux...
[03:56] <zch> soundray: it didn't worked, so i changed the slot and still ifconfig -a shows only eth0, try another slot?
[03:56] <nolimitsoya> *-f
[03:57] <Skwid_> i see
[03:57] <Kayiin> Hey guys, irssi uses the same combination of keys (alt#) for switching tabs as the  Ubuntu Terminal does, is there any way to change that combination in either irssi or the Terminal?
[03:58] <porkpie> guy's can anyone point me in the direction of a script that copies permission ....I have screwed up big time
[03:58] <Skwid_> There are differences between boot sector and its backup.
[03:58] <Skwid_> Differences: (offset:original/backup)
[03:58] <Skwid_> uh ?
[03:58] <Lukian> nolimitsoya, in your opinion ext2 or ext3 for sharing with windows?
[03:58] <nolimitsoya> porkpie, what sort of cript?
[03:58] <nolimitsoya> Lukian, yes.
[03:58] <Lukian> which I mean :)
[03:59] <nolimitsoya> Lukian, ext2 and 3 are the same. ext2ifs doesnt do journaling anyway...
[03:59] <jrib> Kayiin: you can rebind the keys in irssi  /help bind  I think.  i'd prefer to  "edit" -> "keyboard shortcuts"  in gnome-terminal
[03:59] <porkpie> nolimitsoy:I have just chown -R mail:mail on  /usr :(
[03:59] <Lukian> So naturally he should use ext3 if he's using it in linux too?
[03:59] <nolimitsoya> porkpie, thats not a very good idea ;)
[03:59] <Kayiin> jrib: Awesome, thanks!
[03:59] <nolimitsoya> Lukian, thats not a given thing...
[04:00] <porkpie> nolimitsoy:it should have been /usr/mail
[04:00] <CoRnJuLiOx> alrite, i just got a warning saying that 97% of the /tmp folder was in use
[04:00] <Kayiin> Yeah, that's perfect.
[04:00] <CoRnJuLiOx> how do i clear it?
[04:00] <Kayiin> I'll just change the terminal hotkeys around.
[04:00] <VSpike> I'm confused.. I'm missing /etc/cups/mime.types and I've tried "apt-get install cupsys --reinstall" and "dpkg-reconfigure cupsys" but neither has put that file back.. how can I recreate it?
[04:00] <Kayiin> Since I occasionally use Alt+# when I'm on a Windows machine using putty.
[04:00] <michaelpo> hi, why is it i can use wireless assistant in kubuntu.. where is equivalent in ubuntu?
[04:00] <Kayiin> And I'm too used to it. :P
[04:00] <Lukian> Skwid_, specify -ar
[04:00] <porkpie> nolimitsoy:I need to copy permission from one system to another
[04:01] <nolimitsoya> porkpie, then you are pretty much screwed. :) restoring permissions is not something i think can be done with any degreeof comport. it will involve loads of manual labour
[04:01] <Lukian> Skwid_,  and make the original the backup (I think, have someone else here confirm)
[04:01] <Skwid_> Lukian: it still asks me
[04:02] <Lukian> Skwid_, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-32531.html this might be relevant
[04:02] <Lukian> and you can google for your errors just like I am :p
[04:02] <Lukian> so goodnight :D

[04:06] <VSpike> I'm really stuck - I've spent probably 2 days trying to get printing working in (K)ubuntu with no joy.  And questions here, googling and questions on ubuntu forums have not got me any answers, or usually even responses.  I'm really unsure what to next other than format and go back to Windows, because and OS that won't print is no use to me.
[04:07] <Barry> Greetings. I've just tried to upgrade my Firefox on a Hedgehog laptop and it gave me an error. I've tried rebooting, but now it tells me 'I cannot start the X server (your graphical interface). It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?' But before I can select Yes it gives three instances of Error -110 setting multicast list. and then falls out into tty2 in terminal mode. Ctrl

[04:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ICH7 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:11] <burwaco> Barry, maybe try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:11] <VSpike> solid_liq: Yes sorry... 2 yr old son just arrived and started pressing buttons :)
[04:12] <solid_liq> VSpike: ah ok :D
[04:12] <VSpike> solid_liq: I've been round a lot of circles and down dead ends, but i'll try and tell you where I'm stuck at the moment
[04:13] <solid_liq> VSpike: ok
[04:13] <Barry> burwaco: Thanks. I get a perl warning that my "en" language setting isn't installed, then a perl warning that it's falling back to the standard locale, then errors that it cannot set LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES and LC_ALL to default locale because there is no such file or direcotry.
[04:13] <VSpike> Hmm somehow I've fixed at least one problem
[04:13] <we2by> !ogm
[04:13] <VSpike> Let me see how far I get now
[04:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ogm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:14] <neemz> which file do i put modules in to blacklist them?
[04:14] <we2by> how do I play .ogm files?
[04:14] <Barry> burwaco: then, one last error: "xserver-org is broken or not fully installed"

[04:17] <Jowi> we2by, you need to install the theora codecs
[04:17] <Jowi> we2by, (for the videoplayer you use)
[04:18] <we2by> sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-theora
[04:18] <we2by> Passwrd
[04:18] <we2by> erm
[04:18] <Barry> Lukian: One of the logs suggested apt-get install x-window-system, and that has in turn suggested apt-get -f install. So I'm trying that.
[04:18] <Enselic> How do I change the icon of program starter I put on my desktop?
[04:18] <Jowi> we2by, password = your normal password
[04:19] <we2by> Jowi, my player is totem
[04:19] <Enselic> Oh, there it was. You go to properties and click on the icon
[04:19] <neemz> thanks LjL
[04:20] <gavin755> is the ubuntu-standard package equivalent to the server install of ubuntu?
[04:20] <Jowi> we2by, totem-gsteamer or totem-xine?
[04:20] <solid_liq> VSpike: run this at a shell:    apt-get install foomatic-db-engine cupsys-driver-gutenprint foomatic-db-gutenprint
[04:20] <solid_liq> VSpike: what kind of printer is it?
[04:20] <we2by> Jowi, i think it is gstreamer
[04:21] <Jowi> we2by, which version of gstreamer? 0.8 or 0.10 ?
[04:21] <burwaco> Barry, did you remove the firefox 1.5 ?
[04:21] <we2by> Jowi, how do I know?
[04:21] <shuan> hi
[04:21] <Barry> burwaco: No, I didn't remove firefox 1.5 first. There was no mention of that being a requirement.
[04:22] <we2by> Jowi, it is 0.10
[04:22] <solid_liq> VSpike: still there?
[04:22] <jrib> Barry: how did you upgrade firefox?
[04:22] <burwaco> Barry, no you shouldnt
[04:22] <idleo> gavin755: 'apt-cache show ubuntu-standard' will show you what it depends on
[04:22] <shuan> how can i put drive icons on the desktop?
[04:22] <Jowi> we2by, then you should already have the  gstreamer0.10-plugins-base installed that enables theora playback
[04:22] <jrib> !icons | shuan
[04:22] <ubotu> shuan: Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[04:23] <we2by> Jowi, ok, maybe it's not working cause the file is not complete
[04:23] <Wurstwasser> I installed ubuntu. Hmm. Now I wanted to test xubuntu and I did "aptitude install xubuntu-desktop". Now it's configuring "xubuntu-desktop" for more than half an hour. Seems to do nothing...
[04:23] <Barry> burwaco: I just tried apt-get -f install, and it started to churn and eventually came back with, "Errors were encountered while processing: /var/cache/apt/archives/firefox_1.0.7-0ubuntu20_i386.deb E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[04:23] <we2by> it is at 99.6 %
[04:23] <userek> is it possible to isntall 5.04 and simply upgrade it to 6.10? :)
[04:23] <Jowi> we2by, most likely
[04:23] <solid_liq> userek: yep
[04:23] <r00t_> is ther eany nokia suite for ubuntu ?
[04:23] <dbe> FF users, try IceWeasel
[04:23] <gavin755> idleo: actually, I'm just trying to install the ubuntu core from apt, as if I were installing from the (minimal) server install CD. The CD isn't working at the moment.
[04:24] <userek> lets do it then!
[04:24] <Barry> jrib: I used the automatic upgrade tool in the Ubuntu Gnome desktop and selected all the firefox elements and their dependencies.
[04:24] <r00t_> is there any nokia suite for ubuntu ?*
[04:24] <jrib> userek: yes, 5.04 -> 5.10 -> 6.06 -> 6.10  direct upgrade is not supported/recommended.  You are better off installing 6.10 directly imo
[04:24] <osfameron> r00t_: you can do various things with nokia phones on ubuntu.  Some of them quite easily
[04:24] <osfameron> r00t_: (some less so).  I don't think the nokia suite exists for linux though, no
[04:24] <r00t_> osfameron,  with datacable ?
[04:25] <VSpike> solid_liq: yeah sorry.. now got rid of toddler.. "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
[04:25] <osfameron> r00t_: I managed to get datacable to work fine for dialout to Nokia 6630
[04:25] <r00t_> i just wanna use gprs via bluetooth but its wont works

[04:25] <r00t_> can i pm you. osfameron
[04:25] <osfameron> r00t_: having said that, none of the actual recommended tools worked :-)  I ended up copying and editing a wvdial.conf file I found on the internet

[04:26] <VSpike> solid_liq: I also have an HP Laserjet 2550L which doesn't work either :0
[04:26] <osfameron> r00t_: that way if someone who *actually* knows something about this spots it they can let *me* know as well :D
[04:26] <solid_liq> VSpike: I think you have some missing software, ghostscript perhaps, but I didn't see the packages I was hoping to see when I did a search
[04:26] <r00t_> i really wont paste :)
[04:26] <solid_liq> VSpike: that one should be really easy to setup.  It is USB too?
[04:26] <LjL> osfameron: bad idea... at least unless you define "really long" as "anything above one or two lines" ;)
[04:26] <osfameron> LjL: heh, yeah
[04:26] <VSpike> solid_liq: yeah they are all already installed
[04:26] <Kayiin> osfameron: And random people (like me) can read along and learn things as well. :D
[04:27] <VSpike> solid_liq: that was the output i quoted back along
[04:27] <r00t_> osfameron, everything ok but its gprs wont works
[04:27] <osfameron> Kayiin: yeah, that's what I was meaning
[04:27] <VSpike> solid_liq: I could try adding "--reinstall" i guess
[04:27] <solid_liq> VSpike: ok, install those packages
[04:27] <osfameron> r00t_: how are you connecting?
[04:27] <osfameron> I never had any luck using the default network manager thing in gnome for PPP
[04:27] <r00t_> pon gp
[04:27] <r00t_> then what you use?
[04:27] <solid_liq> VSpike: that shouldn't be neccessary
[04:27] <osfameron> I used wvdial
[04:28] <solid_liq> VSpike: are they all installed already?
[04:28] <r00t_> osfameron,  can you give the config ?
[04:28] <VSpike> solid_liq: yes
[04:28] <r00t_> osfameron,  join #L-W
[04:28] <solid_liq> hrm
[04:28] <osfameron> r00t_: sadly I'm on a windows box right now...
[04:28] <VSpike> solid_liq: I'm sort of confused by all the wierd shit in my CUPS error_log, but I dunno how much is normal and how much is not.  And googling for it has not helped
[04:29] <r00t_> osfameron,  please run your linux :(
[04:29] <esaym> is there a way to get accelerated video in mpeg and avi?
[04:29] <osfameron> I thought I'd delicioused the article... hang on
[04:29] <solid_liq> VSpike: have you tried the testpage printing from cups itself?  http://localhost:631
[04:29] <esaym> i thought i read a thread about adding "video overlay" into the xorgconfig file for it or something, now i can find any info...
[04:29] <VSpike> solid_liq: I'd kind of like to try putting my whole printing setup - back to how it was when installed
[04:30] <VSpike> solid_liq: "Unsupported format 'application/postscript'!"
[04:30] <solid_liq> VSpike: where'd that message come from?
[04:30] <Fwangus> can osmone help me tourble shoto a permissions problem?
[04:30] <Fwangus> lol
[04:30] <VSpike> solid_liq: the CUPS web interface
[04:30] <Fwangus> can somone help me trouble shoot a permissions problem
[04:30] <VSpike> solid_liq: When I tried to print a test page, that's what it said
[04:30] <solid_liq> VSpike: ok, that's what I was guessing the problem was.  Give me a min or two to see if I can find the specific packages you need
[04:31] <osfameron> r00t_: nope, I've helpfully not
[04:31] <VSpike> solid_liq: I was thinking it's because I have no /etc/cups/mime.* files
[04:31] <osfameron> r00t_: I can dig it up over the weekend...
[04:31] <solid_liq> VSpike: I'm not sure why they're not in already, you may need to try reinstalling them
[04:31] <Fwangus> for my scanner to work i need to run the program as root
[04:31] <r00t_> osfameron, please change your os .plz for me :(
[04:31] <Fwangus> otherwise it cannot detect the scanner
[04:32] <Fred_> Hey, I have Hoary Hedgehog installed on an old laptop. Can I just download the latest iso and install a new Ubuntu over this, keeping my user data, or do I have to wipe the drive and install fresh? I've tried the little upgrade manager, but it doesn't seem to want to get me upgraded.
[04:32] <osfameron> r00t_: that won't get my laptop to magically transport to work though
[04:32] <osfameron> r00t_: check out gnokii
[04:32] <r00t_> :(
[04:32] <r00t_> gnokii?
[04:32] <Fwangus> but when i get it to run as root using chmod 4710 the program runs and says gtk does not allow setuid to run or somthing along those lines
[04:33] <Fwangus> would anyone here know what to do
[04:33] <Fwangus> it says use a script

[04:34] <ubotu> Fred_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:34] <solid_liq> VSpike: ok, try this:    apt-get install --reinstall libgs-esp8 libppd0
[04:34] <osfameron> r00t_: it's an opensource toolkit for talking to nokia phones.  Ther are also other  programs that purport to make connecting to internet via dialup phones much easier
[04:34] <osfameron> but they didn't work at all for me (back in 2005 anyway, when  first installed Ubuntu Hoary)

[04:35] <Navyseal> anyone good with photoshop or gimp?
[04:35] <Jowi> sorry Fred_ I have to leave in a minute. basicly you can upgrade hoary -> breezy -> dapper -> edgy. but it is easier to do a fresh install of edgy. if you have all the user data on a  separate partition it is easy. if not you have some work ahead of you.

[04:39] <porkpie> guys what perms are these -rwxr-sr-x
[04:39] <VSpike> solid_liq: sitll the same
[04:39] <Jowi> Fred_, hoary is quite old. you can upgrade step by step (hoary->breezy->dapper->edgy) as I said previously (use apt-get dist-upgrade) but most likely something will break. if you have user files on separate partition - reinstall but do not format /home and use it as it is. That is the easiest way. I would not find it worth the effort trying to upgre the system from hoary myself.
[04:39] <LjL> shriphani: vector graphics programs i know of are Inkscape, Sodipodi (Gnome), Karbon (KDE)

[04:46] <hastesaver> kenny_, more than the disc capacity. I think it will go upto 705 MB, but it's a normal CD-RW. Do you think the disc (or worse, the drive) might get damaged?
[04:46] <kenny_> shriphani, you shouldn't upgrade for that, you can install them trough synaptic aswell
[04:47] <vernes> How do I add a grub boot option so that Xorg is runs like THIS ->"X :123 & DISPLAY=:123" ? Do I need to make my own /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-27-386 ?
[04:47] <kenny_> hastesaver, the drive probably not for 705 mb, disc should work too, small chance of fail imo
[04:48] <hastesaver> kenny, what if it goes to 710 MB? :-) (I mean, what are the safe limits?)
[04:48] <wglenncamp> This is driving me CRAZY!  When will there be a fix for pptp-client in Ubuntu edgy?  I use Gnome NetworkManager now, but DNS doesn't work over the VPN connection
[04:48] <r00t_> can anyone tell me where i get spam toolz that can control ubuntu ?
[04:48] <Seilo> guys i need help woth programing mono
[04:48] <lincoln> hastesaver, i think it depends on the disc
[04:48] <wglenncamp> Or does someone know how to get DNS to work over VPN for NetworkManager
[04:48] <kenny_> hastesaver, i would go up to 710 but no higher
[04:49] <wglenncamp> I get DNS for a few mins, but it drops out.
[04:49] <VSpike> solid_liq: "-P" is not known, apparently
[04:49] <hastesaver> lincoln, it's a normal CD-RW that says 700 MB capacity
[04:49] <kenny_> bye all!
[04:49] <shriphani> r00t_, spam tools ?
[04:49] <lincoln> hastesaver, oops.......in my area i can't buy disc with such size.......nearly all of them is 900mb........
[04:50] <r00t_> shriphani,  spam tools mean?
[04:50] <solid_liq> VSpike: try --purge  in it's place then
[04:50] <ubuntu_istanbul> hi guys
[04:50] <jrib> Seilo: try #mono on GIMPNet
[04:50] <hastesaver> lincoln, oh, ok. I won't attempt it; I'll try some other one first
[04:50] <shriphani> <r00t_> can anyone tell me where i get spam toolz that can control ubuntu ?
[04:50] <qos> hey guys ...
[04:50] <r00t_> its just remote control that can control ubuntu from sysmbain ?
[04:50] <r00t_> oooooooopssss sorry
[04:50] <jrib> Seilo: there's a #mono on freenode too, but the GIMPNet is probably larger
[04:51] <lincoln> hastesaver, i think overburning will only hurt the disc,the driver is still save i think
[04:51] <r00t_> shriphani, i mean can anyone tell me where i get symbian toolz that can control ubuntu ?
[04:51] <lincoln> hastesaver, safe

[04:52] <jrib> Seilo: http://www.mono-project.com/IRC for more details
[04:52] <hastesaver> LjL, but it also uses o instead of 0, so who are you speaking to? ;)
[04:52] <fuffal0> i just installed ubuntu server, and after installation i reboot (as requested) and it's frozen at "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel" - i've tried adding: noacpi noapic nousb to grub, still nothing
[04:52] <Kayiin> Ack, I've got a problem with my internets connection.
[04:52] <Kayiin> I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my PC.
[04:52] <Kayiin> Currently running it on my laptop perfectly.
[04:53] <wglenncamp> Does someone know how to get DNS to work over VPN for NetworkManager
[04:53] <Kayiin> But some things (like visiting certain sites) absolutely refuse to work on my PC.
[04:53] <rjg_> that doesn't work tright, at least not for me.
[04:53] <qos> is there a way to bring up a gui from a bash file which asks for a text string or a password?
[04:53] <Kayiin> It's been loading www.ubuntu.com for half an hour now.
[04:54] <hastesaver> lincoln, and by "hurt", it doesn't just mean the disc won't work now, but that it will never work again in future?
=== afflux|afk is now known as afflux
[04:54] <Kayiin> Other sites work perfect.
[04:54] <Kayiin> Connecting to my shell provider barely works either.
[04:54] <Kayiin> It loads half the screen and then just stops.
[04:55] <solid_liq> VSpike: got it yet?
[04:56] <qos> is there a way to bring up a gui from a bash file which asks for a text string or a password?
[04:56] <rjg_> Uh....Nio idea
[04:56] <hastesaver> qos, the asing for a password thing -- is it the bash file is doing or is it what you want the GUI to do?
[04:56] <Biff> qos: ssh-askpass could do it, i dont know of anything better
[04:57] <korupt> anybody know how to get WPA working properly with networkmanager on Edgy?
[04:57] <solid_liq> qos: yeah, kde built kommander I think it's called for that
[04:57] <solid_liq> qos: you can actually make really nice looking UIs with it
[04:57] <lincoln> hastesaver, hum.......for RW i think full format can save the disc if things go wrong.....but haven't tried.....
[04:57] <hastesaver> lincoln, ok, what the heck. I'll try. I can deal with one bad disc :-)
[04:58] <Biff> i'm trying to set up guest access with samba, is there anything else to do then set guest ok = yes ?
[04:58] <lincoln> hastesaver, maybe in my area product cycle is too quick, most people get a dvd-r...so i even don't have chance to use overburn function
[04:59] <qos> i want to add a line of code in one of my bash files. the line should open a gui where to enter a password. something like PW=$(askpw)
[04:59] <scheuri> Biff: yes, make sure the file permissions are correct
[05:00] <scheuri> Biff: and folder permissions
[05:00] <Biff> scheuri: yup, they are, at least on the share (if i su to the nobody user i can read all the files)
[05:00] <hastesaver> qos, why a GUI, BTW? It's a bash script, probably will be running at the terminal, right?
[05:00] <scheuri> Biff: then I guess you should be fine
[05:00] <hastesaver> qos, oh sorry, that was a stupid question. I understand that you might want someone else to be using it...
[05:01] <Biff> but connecting from a windows machine says permission denied
[05:02] <zylche> Everytime I open nautilus, another nautilus window opens up into my home folder, any idea why? i get spammed by them at times...
[05:02] <Lukian> qos: why does it need a password?
[05:02] <Biff> testing from the network browser in nautilus on another machine, i can see that i can get access
[05:02] <qos> hastesaver, yes. it will be run at a terminal. it is a skript which mounts my smb shares. i want to line of code to ask for the pw.
[05:02] <Biff> qos: ssh-askpass does exactly that =)
[05:03] <Biff> even though it says its from ssh
[05:03] <zylche> any help?
[05:03] <qos> Biff, thx ... i brings up an error when i use it when i am root. : Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display
=== Spec[x]  is now known as Spec
[05:04] <scheuri> Biff: is your user in the system AND added to smbpasswd?
[05:04] <Biff> qos: yep, you cant su and run x programs
[05:04] <hastesaver> qos, Something like x=$(ssh-askpass) works for me. Without root.
[05:04] <hastesaver> qos, oh, if you're root, you need to have logged in with X enabled. (Like with gksu or something)
[05:05] <Biff> scheuri: i'm trying to use guest access, do i still need to add a user to smbpasswd?
[05:05] <scheuri> Biff: as far as I know, yes
[05:05] <Biff> apparently it worked from nautilus
[05:05] <zylche> http://www.mail-archive.com/desktop-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg53190.html
[05:05] <hastesaver> qos, or "ssh -X root@localhost" :-)
[05:05] <korupt> qos: you need to use gksu for graphical apps running as root
[05:05] <Biff> so maybe windows is not sending the right username
[05:05] <solid_liq> VSpike: you still around?
[05:06] <scheuri> Biff: yes, that is correct...or you are mapping to the wrong one
[05:06] <Rprp> Does someone know how to install mysql? apt-get install mysql doesnt work
[05:06] <Rprp> :/
[05:06] <scheuri> Biff: but that is a wild guess
[05:06] <Lam_> what reason could there possibly be to have $ shutdown -H    it seems pointless since everyone trying to -h their system wants -P
[05:06] <qos> the skript is on my desktop and i want to click on it, enter my pw, and everything is all right ...
[05:06] <scheuri> Rprp: "aptitude search mysql" will show packages with mysql in the name
[05:06] <Lukian> Rprp, apt-cache search mysql
[05:07] <VSpike> solid_liq: yes.. sorry.. visitor arrived.
[05:07] <incorrect> does anyone here run ubuntu ontop of vmware?
[05:07] <zspada15> can i write to my ntfs partitions?
[05:07] <korupt> Rprp: mysql-server is the correct package
[05:07] <Rprp> oke, thnx

[05:09] <zspada15> korupt, use wifi-radar, it'll work better
[05:09] <Eroick> Hello. I have been using Ubuntu for a while now and it worked nicely, but now I have a major error. It boots up successfully but cannot start X or GDM. Instead I get a nice blue screen with an error. I am using Dapper Drake and I want to get my X back so I can upgrade to Edgy! My video card is an nVidia GForce FX 5200 (or something like that). Here is the error: (EE) Failed to load module...

[05:09] <Kayiin> That's the second time my Ubuntu installation crashed on my main PC.
[05:09] <scheuri> Kayiin: define "crashed"
[05:09] <Biff> scheuri: mapping to the wrong one?
[05:09] <zspada15> korupt, i hear ya, ive never worked with wpa, but wifi is a pain
[05:10] <Kayiin> Well, froze.
[05:10] <Kayiin> Froze at 57%
[05:10] <scheuri> Biff: well, guest is "nobody"?
[05:10] <Kayiin> No sound from the CD drive anymore.
[05:10] <Biff> scheuri: that didnt work
[05:10] <Kayiin> I can still use the live CD mode though.
[05:10] <Biff> well, writing nobody didnt work
[05:10] <scheuri> Biff: then I actually don't know
[05:10] <korupt> zspada15: it isn't too bad in edgy with networkmanager..... but WPA is being picky
[05:10] <Biff> in the dialog box in windows

[05:12] <zylche> Can someone help me?
[05:12] <GigaClon_> im having swap problems, System Monitor reports that I have 0MB swap
[05:12] <Kayiin> scheuri: Could that be the reason that I also have limited internet access in live CD mode?

[05:13] <zylche> gah.. it just did it again.. 4 windows..
[05:13] <solid_liq> VSpike: wow, I had no idea it would uninstall so much
[05:13] <Kayiin> Yeah, certain sites work perfectly, other don't.

[05:24] <incorrect> have a look at /etc/iftab
[05:24] <fuffal0> does ubuntu 6.10 have LTS on the server edition, or is it just 6.06 that has that
[05:24] <VSpike> solid_liq: I guess i want to choose the HPLIP one, right?
[05:24] <solid_liq> VSpike: that's where I used to hang out all the time, and it's usually better late at night :D
[05:24] <solid_liq> VSpike: yep
[05:24] <incorrect> this contains a line like eth0 mac 00:0C:29:D4:B0:FA arp 1
[05:25] <incorrect> if that mac changes you can no longer access eth0
[05:25] <incorrect> can't even ifconfig eth0 up to get the mac

[05:26] <HumanPrototype> what alternatives are there to tsclient?
[05:26] <neverm1nd> how install lazarus on AMD64?
[05:26] <jrib> fuffal0: 6.06 is the only LTS release so far
[05:27] <incorrect> add, replace, remove :)
[05:27] <devilsadvocate> incorrect, i have a removable nic, If i pull it out, I dont see eth1 anymore
[05:27] <neverm1nd> how install lazarus on AMD64?
[05:27] <incorrect> devilsadvocate: my pc has one nic,  if i replace it, it still has one nic
[05:28] <VSpike> solid_liq: after I select that, it asks me to do the Printer model selection.  That printer is not in the list (HP Laserjet 2550L) but the linuxprinting database says use HPLIP driver.. so how do I choose that driver?
[05:28] <HumanPrototype> devilsadvocate: incorrect is just takingone network card out and putting another in i think
[05:28] <devilsadvocate> incorrect, yes. but the entry now corresponds to your new nic, and most probably the mac should have been set to the correct one
[05:29] <devilsadvocate> yes HumanPrototype i understand what incorrect is doing
[05:29] <Kayiin> Support for my Logitech G15, awesomeness.
[05:29] <incorrect> if you remove eth0, and i replace it with a new card
[05:29] <Kayiin> <3 Kubuntu
[05:29] <incorrect> then the mac addy is wrong in iftab
[05:29] <solid_liq> VSpike: choose something similar like 2500 or whatever you see that was maybe an earlier model
[05:29] <neverm1nd> how install lazarus on AMD64?

[05:30] <incorrect> iftab doesn't dynamically update, the idea is to lock nic's to a ethX number
[05:30] <devilsadvocate> incorrect, what prevents you from restarting?
[05:30] <grndslm> if you guys had a choice for a laptop, between Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 -or- ATI Mobility Radeon X1300 64MB...which would you pick?
[05:31] <incorrect> devilsadvocate: how do you think restarting fixes the issue?
[05:31] <neverm1nd> ATI
[05:31] <grndslm> really??
[05:31] <devilsadvocate> it would probe the hardware once more
[05:31] <incorrect> you can restart a million times and /etc/iftab will still have the old mac address
[05:31] <neverm1nd> that's my choice
[05:31] <renzo17> ATI
[05:31] <grndslm> i thought everybody tried to avoid ATI like the plague?
[05:31] <tom47> incorrect is this related o yr earlier q about running ubuntu under vm?
[05:31] <grndslm> what changed?  does ati open source their drivers now?
[05:31] <renzo17> although i would scrap both and get nvidia
[05:32] <incorrect> tom47, well yes and no,
[05:32] <neverm1nd> I'm using ATI Xpress 200 in my notebook
[05:32] <neverm1nd> :)
[05:32] <renzo17> nah fglrx works fine for ati
[05:32] <grndslm> the thinkpads only have those 2 options
[05:32] <incorrect> tom47,  i created a virtual disk, i am lazy and i thought yay i can quickly deploy fresh machines
[05:32] <finalbeta> !cue
[05:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cue - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:32] <grndslm> renzo:  hmm.....crazy...so there's really no reason people should still be running windows?
[05:32] <incorrect> however when you create a new virtual machine, you get a new mac address
[05:33] <grndslm> renzo17: it's all about the graphics drivers, right?
[05:33] <neverm1nd> !lazarus
[05:33] <finalbeta> How do I read cue&bin files without having to burn them?
[05:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lazarus - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:33] <incorrect> basically i am doing the virtual equiv of replacing my physical nic
[05:33] <incorrect> the error message should say something like, sorry eth0 and /etc/iftab's eth0 mac do not match
[05:33] <VSpike> solid_liq: splendid -- a perfect test page
[05:33] <incorrect> not some horrible error message
[05:34] <solid_liq> VSpike: sweet
[05:34] <renzo17> depends how competent you are, most people i know wouldnt have a clue with linux, and linux still has it hardware issues, i cant get ANY distro to install on my laptop, yet XP runs fine, much to my displeasure
[05:34] <solid_liq> VSpike: HP's have really good output from Linux
[05:34] <incorrect> tom47, edit your /etc/iftab file and change your mac, reboot your computer and see if you can ifup eth0 ;)
[05:34] <renzo17> grndslm ; right !! >_<
[05:35] <devilsadvocate> renatofilho,  is your laptop based on the intel 965 chipset?
[05:35] <tom47> incorrect ... pass
[05:35] <devilsadvocate> renzo17,   is your laptop based on the intel 965 chipset?
[05:35] <incorrect> i just thought i would share my discovery
[05:35] <tom47> lol
[05:35] <renzo17> no, nforce shipset, its an Evesham Quest A240 ( a clone of a Clevo M665JE )
[05:36] <noelferreira> hi people
[05:36] <noelferreira> need rt61 wireless driver help
[05:36] <incorrect> it could really screw someone over if they didn't know
[05:36] <subdee> when compiling the kernel on a Intel Core 2 Duo cpu, which processor type do i declare? P4M?
[05:36] <renzo17> i have just downloaded debian as my last resort, if that doesnt work im giving up and gonna use windows (or sell it to my bro and get a compatible one)
[05:36] <VSpike> solid_liq: I'm slightly confused as to the options.  The printer was in the list, just not where I was looking.  I could choose "Colour Laserjet HP2550 Series" which didn't ask any more questions, or "Colour Laserjet HP2550" which then asked if I wanted "Foomatic + Postscript (recommended)" or "Foomatic + HPIJS"
[05:36] <incorrect> renzo17: what are you trying to do?
[05:37] <tom47> love ya and leave ya time bye
[05:37] <cleo> xchat-gnome wouldnt let me specify network... want irc.kaffeinenet.com ... running edgy eft
[05:37] <VSpike> solid_liq: Anyway I went for the former, and it seems to work nicely.
[05:37] <renzo17> incorrect, install linux on my laptop
[05:37] <VSpike> solid_liq: again, thanks so much fo rthe help
[05:37] <incorrect> renzo17: what type?
[05:37] <solid_liq> VSpike: sure, no problem
[05:37] <PaSurf> what program is used to open PDFs from the command line?
[05:37] <renzo17> no distro i have tried so far works, i have aproblems with my DSDT, linux image wont even load before the install
[05:37] <solid_liq> VSpike: so how are you liking Linux now?
[05:38] <renzo17> incorrect, all of them, ubuntu fedora, mandriva, gentoo, opensuse ( i386 and amd64)
[05:38] <kditty> how can i mount a dvd image, so i can use dvdshrink?
[05:38] <noelferreira> anyone helps me with rt61 wireless driver?
[05:38] <incorrect> renzo17: ok can you give me a make a model of the laptop?
[05:39] <renzo17> Evesham Quest A240 (also apparently a clone of the Clevo M665JE)
=== afflux is now known as fnord|einkaufen
[05:39] <incorrect> as in evesham value?
[05:39] <VSpike> solid_liq: a lot better than an hour ago :)
[05:39] <renzo17> i guess so,
[05:39] <renzo17> www.evesham.com
[05:39] <VSpike> solid_liq: Still got lots more stuff to get working I think
[05:40] <VSpike> solid_liq: But that was obviously a major one
[05:40] <solid_liq> VSpike: hardware, or just learning apps?
[05:40] <incorrect> ok not from evesham micro then
[05:40] <VSpike> solid_liq: hardware.. I have a problem with display drivers I think
[05:41] <renzo17> incorrect,after some heavy googling  i can get the livecd to boot using acpi=ht pci=conf2 but cos the options it cannot see my harddrive so i cant install
[05:41] <incorrect> renzo17: so you have issues with the DVD player?
[05:41] <incorrect> ah
[05:41] <solid_liq> VSpike: nvidia or ati?
[05:41] <VSpike> solid_liq: when I tried to install from the live CD, it hanged unless I went to "safe mode" or whatever it calls it.  And after installing, I only had the VESA driver
[05:41] <VSpike> solid_liq: ATI
[05:41] <renzo17> no, i think its to do with PnP in the BIOS and my DSDT
[05:41] <incorrect> renzo17: trying debian won't let
[05:41] <incorrect> help
[05:42] <incorrect> what you need to try is an modern distro
[05:42] <incorrect> what i suggest is build yourself a USB keyring drive
[05:42] <renzo17> i have, about five of them
[05:42] <incorrect> you can do this easy by debootstrapping one
[05:42] <solid_liq> VSpike: go to ati.com, drivers and downloads, and get the linux driver
[05:42] <incorrect> then just grub it
[05:42] <solid_liq> VSpike: then it's pretty easy to install
[05:42] <VSpike> solid_liq: I tried to enable the free ATI driver, but it just hung the X server.. so I tried the ATI binary - after getting really confused by loads of conflicting install guides - and eventually got it working, although I forget how exactly
[05:42] <renzo17> apparently it can be done with a custom kernel but im not really up for remastering CDs
[05:42] <solid_liq> VSpike: there's a wiki page for installing it on ubuntu
[05:43] <cld2> can you do a dist upgrade form synaptic or do I need to use apt-get?
[05:43] <renzo17> its not a DVD/CD issue, just the kernel is not recognising some of my PnP hardware
[05:43] <VSpike> solid_liq: I think that's the one I used, although there are plenty of forum posts too about it - mostly along the lines of "I couldn't get the wiki page to work, so here is what worked for me" followed by lots of comments saying "thank you thank you .. finally works for me too".. so I may have gone with one of those
[05:43] <renzo17> budget BIOS and buggy DSDT
[05:44] <VSpike> solid_liq: all slight variations on a theme
[05:44] <renzo17> should have researched compatibility before i handed over my credit card
[05:44] <incorrect> renzo17: like i say, just get yourself a usb keyring to boot into a full distro, you should probably have more luck that way
[05:44] <r00t_> !linuxantivirus | r00t_
[05:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about linuxantivirus - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:45] <r00t_> !antivirus | r00t_
[05:45] <ubotu> r00t_: antivirus is something you don't really need on Linux, unless you serve windows clients. ClamAV and aegis are decent linux virusscanners. Also see !linuxvirus
[05:45] <solid_liq> VSpike: it's fairly easy.  download the latest driver, install with sudo, run sudo aticonfig --initial   and reboot
[05:45] <renzo17> ah i see what you mean, good thinking
[05:45] <r00t_> !linuxvirus
[05:45] <ubotu> The short life and hard times of a Linux Virus http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[05:45] <incorrect> lspci should give you way more info that any installer
[05:45] <renzo17> might try DSL then
[05:45] <VSpike> solid_liq: It seems to be kind of working.. fglrxinfo gives me the expected output, and fglrxgears runs
[05:45] <Yggdrasil> how can i rip a dvd onto my hd in ubuntu
[05:45] <incorrect> also with the usb stick you might find that the latest kernel fixes your problems
[05:45] <solid_liq> VSpike: but does it run fast?
[05:45] <incorrect> remember installers don't come with the latest and greatest version of things
[05:46] <renzo17> will i not experience a speed decrease using a USB distro
[05:46] <renzo17> ?
[05:46] <incorrect> renzo17: also you will find debootstrap a really sweet way to install your system,  chroot is cool too
[05:46] <VSpike> solid_liq: yeah, pretty fast.. my problems are that the KDE System Settings Monitor and Display thing won't load
[05:46] <incorrect> renzo17: you only use it to install
[05:46] <VSpike> solid_liq: also that xmms plugins are a bit choppy and some of them crash the X server
[05:46] <VSpike> solid_liq: also that GL screensavers dont work
[05:46] <incorrect> bring up the system using the usb stick, and then use bootstrap to finish the system
[05:46] <solid_liq> VSpike: use amaroK instead of xmms
[05:47] <renzo17> incorrect; thanks, will have to continue this later though, i'll do some research, laters
[05:47] <solid_liq> VSpike: strange that fglrxgears works but not openGL screensavers
[05:47] <VSpike> solid_liq: I have both - just trying to figure out which is less buggy
[05:47] <Raphael> is there a gdesklet for checking quotas?
[05:47] <incorrect> remember to put the 10 second delay into your initrd config
[05:47] <cr4ftyb0n35> Hello all.
[05:47] <regx> LMFAO
[05:48] <VSpike> solid_liq: it may be an unrelated problem because my screensavers seem to have stopped working altogether - I now just get a big X logo
[05:48] <Yggdrasil> anyone tell me how to rip a dvd to my hd using ubuntu, its a dvd with commercials that was made for the place i work so its not encrypted or anything but i want it in a more transportable format .
[05:48] <cr4ftyb0n35> Had some major issues installing Dapper and Edgy on my system. The install took 4 hours, I am not kidding, 4 hours. 32 bit install on a 64 bit system. The issue I found out was SATA. Man, its been normal. Anyone care to listen/interested?
[05:48] <cr4ftyb0n35> read: abnormal, not normal
[05:48] <VSpike> solid_liq: once you are using the ATI driver, is there a special ATI app you use for setting display resolutions etc?
[05:49] <WizCraker> do I just use alien to install rpm packages?  and am I correct in the syntax  alien -i file.rpm ?
[05:49] <solid_liq> VSpike: no, you need to have them set in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:49] <solid_liq> VSpike:  what version of kubuntu are you on?
[05:50] <Bastian_> -t
[05:50] <Eula> hi evertihing, im troubke with encoder im 6.10
[05:50] <cr4ftyb0n35> Once I installed, there were further issues. the SATA drive wouldn't mount very well. It just seems like this chipset support in general is bad. A shutdown doesn't work either. Its really queer.
[05:50] <VSpike> solid_liq: I looked at my xorg.conf, and there were loads of display resolution lines in there... but they all related to a different device, the original VESA driven on.  And for the new ATI binary one, there were no display lines at all
[05:50] <VSpike> solid_liq: edgy
[05:50] <Eula> someone of theirs like this trouble
[05:50] <Eula> yes edgy
[05:50] <mrlinux> i need help setting up dhcp
[05:50] <Eula> im girl in troubles

[05:51] <BlackHawk> hi
[05:51] <cr4ftyb0n35> hello
[05:51] <Eula> im programing with apache2 php5 mysql5
[05:51] <solid_liq> VSpike: hmm, you seem to have a lot of strange problems, so I'm wondering if your install media was bad
[05:51] <Eula> with 'ide' eclipse
[05:52] <solid_liq> VSpike: you might want to try reinstalling, and I'd recommend dapper actually, because it's much less buggy
[05:52] <cr4ftyb0n35> Hello Eula. Recently set it up on dapper and edgy....
[05:52] <solid_liq> VSpike: you can always upgrade via the net later
[05:52] <VSpike> solid_liq: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/21xtz065.html
[05:52] <korupt> well, the wpa thing did me absolutely no good
[05:52] <shuan> how can i find out which release i have?
[05:52] <VSpike> solid_liq: Heh, now you tell me :) I assumed it would be less buggy
[05:53] <korupt> does anyone know how to get WPA to work with edgy with a proxim card and networkmanager?
[05:53] <solid_liq> VSpike: no, dapper is LTS (long term support), so they made SURE to make it good
[05:53] <Eula> this is a new instalation edgy from scratch
[05:53] <solid_liq> VSpike: edgy has a new init system which doesn't seem to be perfected yet
[05:53] <cr4ftyb0n35> Eula: Eclipse's php addons aren't in Ubuntu's repositories
[05:54] <graham_100> #ubuntu-classroom
[05:54] <VSpike> solid_lig: I guess to downgrade I have to do a clean install?
[05:54] <cr4ftyb0n35> solid_lisq: Just wondering, do you think that might screw up SATA issues?
[05:54] <woei> can anyone recommend a _small_ http proxy server ? Squid's way too big. I'm just interested in the proxying of request, it needn't cache a thing
[05:54] <VSpike> solid_liq: I guess to downgrade I have to do a clean install?
[05:54] <Eula> im execute dpkg-reconfigure locales -all
[05:54] <shuan> how do i find out which version of ubuntu i have
[05:54] <solid_liq> VSpike: yeah :(
[05:54] <Eula> yes i do, 4<cr4ftyb0n35>
[05:54] <korupt> woei: apache can be used to proxy
[05:54] <woei> shuan: cat /etc/debian_version
[05:55] <VSpike> solid_liq: I'm not sure I could go through the pain of getting everything working again -- better the devil I know, since at least it's functional
[05:55] <Eula> im download plugin for php and others
[05:55] <woei> korrupt: apache's probably even bigger than squid
[05:55] <solid_liq> VSpike: yeah but with dapper it should just work
[05:55] <VSpike> solid_liq: presumably if I just hang around, edgy will improve around me :)
[05:55] <cr4ftyb0n35> Ugh. This is so hopeless, I am giving up on getting this chipset to work on Ubuntu. the sucky thing is it was working on Debian Etch :(
[05:55] <Eula> /etc/locale.gen dont exist
[05:56] <solid_liq> VSpike: a friend of mine recently had the same problem with edgy on install you talked about, and I got him to install dapper instead, and he was happy everything worked perfectly
[05:56] <woei> giving tinyproxy a shot
[05:56] <VSpike> solid_liq: fair point, although I did this install by using a dapper CD (because it was one I happened to have) and then doing an upgrade right away
[05:56] <shuan> woei: i typed in cat /etc/debian_version
[05:57] <shuan> woei: i got this msg testing/unstable
[05:57] <VSpike> solid_liq: it was dapper which refused to load with this card, and installed a VESA driver - edgy just kept that
[05:58] <VSpike> solid_liq: After I installed, it wanted to download several hundred MB of updates anyway, so I figured heck, if I'm gonna download all that, I might just as well go the next release
[05:58] <cr4ftyb0n35> Maybe I should just file a bug on Ubuntu
[05:58] <Rprp> Well, does someone know how i can get that lm-sensors working? i installed it but still its not detecting some sensors
[05:58] <Rprp> ( Sensors ) Temperature [ CPU: No Sensor found | System: No Sensor found ]

[05:59] <VSpike> solid_liq: no problem :)
[06:00] <mmattocks> hello?
[06:00] <cr4ftyb0n35> Anyone else here have major SATA issues?
[06:00] <cr4ftyb0n35> Dapper and Edgy just aren't getting my chipset itself it would seem...
[06:00] <cr4ftyb0n35> For instance, I shutdown and it won't shutdown
[06:00] <cr4ftyb0n35> it'll sort of shutdown, but not turn off

[06:12] <Daynah> and keeps other things open? I don't know what it's called...
[06:12] <defrysk> notification area
[06:13] <Daynah> well I made it dissapear. And now Opera and Gaim and other things actually close when they close
[06:13] <Aranel> In the notifiaction area?
[06:13] <Daynah> awesome. I saw that in the "add to panel"
[06:13] <Aranel> yeah, that'll fix it
[06:13] <defrysk> Daynah, rightclick empty sot on panel
[06:13] <x[x] > guys
[06:13] <defrysk> spot*
[06:13] <defrysk> choose add
[06:13] <defrysk> and select notification area
[06:13] <systemrestore> when does ubuntu release new versions, set dates or just bug fixes?
[06:13] <x[x] > i downloaded this
[06:13] <Daynah> I got it Thanks guys :)
[06:13] <x[x] >  http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu//6.06/ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso
[06:13] <x[x] > i clicked install/boot from cd
[06:13] <x[x] > #it does a load of loading stuff
[06:13] <Daynah> I just didn't know it was called a notification area. I felt really blonde
[06:13] <x[x] > then it says installing user
[06:14] <x[x] > it does that for about 2 mins then i get a blank screen where i can enter stuff
[06:14] <Aranel> systemrestore, Ubuntu releases new versions every 6 months to sync itself with GNOME releases (also every 6 months).
[06:14] <defrysk> Daynah, we need blonds to feel usefull
[06:14] <waldo> ok... so i install ethereal using apt-get... then when i try to run it from the command line, it wont show up as a possible command... nothing shows up in internet in the menu either... anyone know how to fix it?
[06:14] <Daynah> I'm all blah blah blah do this fancy thing makin' new kernels blah blah... oh no...
[06:14] <cr4ftyb0n35> waldo, sudo...?
[06:14] <St3althy> ok this is rediculous
[06:15] <waldo> cr4ftyb0n35, did it
[06:15] <St3althy> stupid ubuntu is SLOW over network
[06:15] <St3althy> something is broke and its a fresh install
[06:15] <Daynah> Waldo, when I install things from Synaptic/Apt-get, that happens a LOT I don't know why. ?Have you tried just... running it from the terminal?
[06:15] <waldo> yea
[06:15] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: When you say "slow over the network..."
[06:15] <waldo> thats what im doing
[06:15] <waldo> it wont run from terminal
[06:15] <waldo> "command not found"
[06:15] <St3althy> cr4ftyb0n35: like i trying to ssh right
[06:16] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: are you ssh-ing from another box?
[06:16] <St3althy> cr4ftyb0n35: its slow as, like time outs
[06:16] <St3althy> yes on my network
[06:16] <Daynah> Waldo, have you looked in the system folders and seen if there are folders there for the program?
[06:16] <defrysk> waldo its apt-get , not Apt-get
[06:16] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: so can you ping from that box and see what the return times are like?
[06:16] <Daynah> You know just to make sure it didn't... fake install.
[06:16] <defrysk> waldo, no caps
[06:16] <waldo> i know
[06:16] <St3althy> cr4ftyb0n35: yep i can ping
[06:17] <waldo> Daynah, i "locate" ethereal, only the nessus plugins show up
[06:17] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: obviously, but what are the ping stats like?
[06:17] <waldo> i found the .deb package... but it doesnt look like its installed
[06:17] <JameyC> huh... nevermind, alsa's on crack, reboot fixed it and the nodes showed up.
[06:17] <St3althy> cr4ftyb0n35: well sometimes its fine, others it times out
[06:17] <St3althy> what do i set for my dns
[06:17] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: Then its not a Ubuntu issue
[06:17] <zylche> alsa is on crack here as well.
[06:18] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: what else do you have on your LAN?

[06:18] <wonderboy> pls
[06:18] <St3althy> 5 pc's
[06:18] <St3althy> they are all fine
[06:18] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: the box you are pinging from, what OS is it?
[06:19] <St3althy> windows
[06:19] <St3althy> but like it times out sometimes
[06:19] <cr4ftyb0n35> st3althy: run a tracert to the ubuntu box
[06:19] <St3althy> then is fine
[06:19] <Daynah> Waldo, try again? If you can apt-get, it should be in synaptic. You'll get a prettier picture of what packages it depends on. Maybe the dependencies were a little weird when it installed, it didn't install, but it did download, and you just didn't notice. A lot of times I stare at the terminal and go "Yeah yeah blah blah blah lots of text WHATEVA!"
[06:19] <wonderboy> is somebody who can tell me?

[06:21] <zylche> no, I don't mean as in each window opens seperatel,y I mean another nautilus process seems to start for no reason
[06:21] <waldo> did they rename ethereal to wireshark?
[06:21] <Daynah> Zylche, another process?
[06:21] <graham_100> my card is recognised as a Ralink RT61 (it's a belkin card)
[06:22] <Daynah> Waldo, I don't think they renamed it, I think the developers just realized the other project was better and moved over. It was ehther Ethereal to Wireshark or the other way around I can't remember...
[06:22] <graham_100> i know driver location but do i need to install them?

[06:29] <FriedCPU> Elda: you should be able to slow down the cube in the beryl config menu (i havnt got it installed atm to tell you where, But if i remember rightly you can)

[06:31] <Daynah> noelferreira, I don't think it's a very large problem... large as in there's going to be data loss or anything, so don't worry! I know things can get frustrating but just don't worry. If you can, try to find out what kind of wireless card you have. There are ways to do this in terminal but... you know what? I just don't know how. Once you find that out, go to the Ubuntu Forums and search for your wireless card. It's very likely that someone will tell you h

[06:35] <Daynah> Elro, I tried doing that once, but it's just best to install ubuntu with NO internet access if you don't have it yet. What you told ubuntu is "This is the internet information you need to use to get the updates that have come out since they made that first install." and you don't have it yet, so you should restart the install. I'm very sorry. :( Luckily, Ubuntu has a quick and easy install.
[06:35] <compengi> graham_100: so?
[06:35] <defrysk> vmware, why not both , and also sudo apt-get install build-essential

[06:55] <Daynah> Dheeraj_k, different people like different things. For example, in windows, I HATE Windows media Player, but I like QuickTime, and my Boyfriend likes RealPlayer. Just try out what you like. Use Synaptic to easily install and uninstall (in Linux, things are COMPLETELY uninstalled, unlike in Windows, that leaves little bits to clog up your computer)
[06:55] <gnomefreak> Dheeraj_k: xine doesnt have an interface xine is just an engine

I'm using 6.10 AMD64, and all I see is the loading screen (which says kubuntu since I installed kubuntu-desktop) then an error about tty not being accessible and Ubuntu hangs... is this enough info for anyone to help me or do I need exactly what it says? I tried running recov

[07:15] <ClayDragon> as far as i know, linux saves the main memory into the swap partition when hibernating. but what happens when i do not boot into ubuntu, but into another linux on my harddisk that happens to use the same swap partition? will all my hibernate data be destroyed?
[07:15] <Yi> hmm...anyone know how to customize the installation for Ubuntu Server? I want some package installed by default. I don't want to apt-get later
[07:16] <stojance> azion like so: sudo chmod +rw blablabla

[07:18] <stojance> ClayDragon: I don't know, I did that once, hibernated and went to Windows and then Ubuntu came out of hibernation. but that data will be destroyed if that swap is used by another OS.

[07:20] <kjm> emilia - try rm ~/.dmrc and relogin (unless there are some crazy customizations of dmrc - and I don't even know what dmrc is)
[07:21] <ClayDragon> mister_roboto: personally i think the winxp approach with creating a "hibernate-diskfile" where all the memory is stored during hibernation is a much better idea than storing it in the swap partition
[07:22] <defrysk> ClayDragon, xp has no swap policy whatsoever
[07:22] <ProN00b> Flannel, and how do i build it so i get the equivalent of the package in repos ? (i just want to mod a few lines in source and replace the binary)
[07:22] <mister_roboto> ClayDragon: i'd like to know the anwer to your question too. since your swap is likely gonna get filled, or close to it, from memory, i can't see how it would survive another linux using it
[07:22] <ClayDragon> defrysk: what do you mean by "policy"
[07:23] <defrysk> ClayDragon, a default xp install has not proper swap partition
[07:23] <ClayDragon> mister_roboto: thats exactly what i thought. i have 1gb main memory, and an i admit oversized swap of 3 gb
[07:24] <gnomefreak> UhligH__: ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:24] <anurag> !hi
[07:24] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[07:24] <ClayDragon> defrysk: yes i know that windows saves its swap into a file, but afaik windows also stores its suspend-to-disk information into a separate file
[07:24] <vmware> !truecrypt
[07:24] <Rooster> hey guys,  I was just curious.  For all the files that are called automatically when a program is started like: initrc, bashrc or ktorrentrc.  What does the rc stand for
[07:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about truecrypt - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:24] <vmware> !truecyrpt

[07:25] <Rooster> anybody know?
[07:25] <ClayDragon> defrysk: yeah sorry, this is not #winxp ;-) *g*
[07:26] <anurag> how to customize the splash screen, anybody knows?
[07:26] <mister_roboto> vmware: you're gonna have to compile it from source
[07:26] <anurag> !splash
[07:26] <ubotu> To change the Gnome splash screen, open the gconf-editor and change the key /apps/gnome-session/options/splash-image.
[07:26] <anurag> got it :D
[07:26] <anurag> wah, what a place to hang-out with
[07:26] <anurag> bots
[07:27] <vmware> thanks, mister_roboto. i've got it installed. i've had it for ages infact. i just don't understand how anyone ever knows how to use it lol
[07:27] <mister_roboto> vmware: it's pretty easy actually :)
[07:27] <mister_roboto> vmware: and very cool.   i use it on a thumbdrive that gets mounted on windows and linux both
[07:27] <Flannel> ProN00b: it's pretty simple.  Um, unfortunately almost none of the wiki pages cover it.  But, I found one!  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CreatePackageFromSourcePackage  Except, don't worry about the changelog line.
[07:27] <r00t_> gedit ~/.local/share/mime/packages/Override.xml is not found
[07:27] <r00t_> any idea
[07:27] <r00t_> ?
[07:28] <mister_roboto> vmware: read their online docs. explains things very well
[07:28] <tyrone> where can i find a how-to which explains how i forward the xserver or a single prgram of a remotely connected sshserver to the client?
[07:28] <vmware> lol, well i've spent months thinking about trying to get it working, but i just can't do it for some reason, yes, that's it - all the tuts are for thumbdrives, i want to encrypt a directory
[07:28] <ClayDragon> another question: ive installed compiz and 3ddesktop, but how do i activate it?
[07:28] <vmware> mister_roboto: ^^
[07:28] <ProN00b> Flannel, k thnx
[07:28] <Lynoure> Rooster: my wild guess would be readable configuration. Rumor says runnable commands.
[07:29] <mrlinux> i have an error in my dhcp i need help
[07:29] <anurag> ClayDragon, run the scripts in user sessions
[07:29] <mister_roboto> vmware: if you're a little put off by the linux command line tool, try the windows gui for creating your encrypted volume from a file.

[07:29] <vmware> mister_roboto: i'll look through the docs again, it just starts getting more and more comlicated when i start reading, i haven't actuaclly run a command yet.
[07:29] <mister_roboto> vmware: they have a quick start guide that will have you mounting an encrypted volume in about 10 minutes, tops
[07:30] <mister_roboto> vmware: just do it, do it as you're reading the quick start guide
[07:30] <ClayDragon> anurag: where are those scripts?
[07:30] <mister_roboto> vmware: it will make sense once you do it :)
[07:30] <anurag> ClayDragon, google is your friend.
[07:30] <vmware> i'm not put off by CLI, i use linux every day, i just have a problem with truecrypt. i'll read the docs lol thanks for the help :)
[07:30] <vmware> mister_roboto: ^^
[07:30] <rbil> tyrone: in sshd_config set line X11Forwarding yes
[07:31] <ClayDragon> anurag: yeah, right ^^
[07:31] <mister_roboto> vmware: if you're still stuck, i can hold your hand through it later  :)
[07:31] <mister_roboto> vmware: just not now
[07:31] <anurag> ClayDragon, what gfx card you have ?
[07:31] <craigbass1976> How do I make an icon for a regular user to dial up?
[07:31] <anurag> ClayDragon, can you ellobrate much on that

[07:31] <Rooster> thanks a lot lynoure
[07:32] <craigbass1976> I already have the connection and can dial up as the first user I created on the system
[07:32] <vmware> mister_roboto: 8) i'll try running a command first, i haven't ever manged to get started, i get put off. i should be fine in VM anyway if i make a mistake

=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-out
[07:40] <allah_the_Mercif> now i have to change each one individually to hear
[07:40] <rbil> tyrone: if that doesn't do it for you then you'll need to make possible changes in ssh_conf on client side as well
[07:41] <Newbie> Have problems with my ASUS P5L-MX. Very common and famous LAN and sound problems
[07:41] <zspada15> ugg, have to restart to get the bastard out

[07:43] <KanRiNiN_> Is anyone familiar with enlightenment and fluxbox?  I'm trying to determine which is more usable out of the box.  I have some extra time this weekend and I'm going to try to convert my default Edgy install to one of those lighter window managers..
[07:43] <rbil> tyrone: read a similar answer I gave in this forum ... http://customdesign.homelinux.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=21
[07:44] <craigbass1976> KanRiNiN_, I've used fluxbox on DSL and Knoppix.  Very fast.
[07:45] <eclipse> can I get a little help about grep here ?
[07:45] <KanRiNiN_> Yea.  Gnome is great, actually faster with AIGLX and beryl, but I want something a touch faster loading.  Maybe I'll try to replace GDM too.
[07:45] <craigbass1976> Ayone know how to make an icon that will dial out for a regular user?  I gave him permission to establish a dial up connection, but nothing showed up in his menus

[07:46] <KanRiNiN_> thanks craigbass1976

[07:55] <edd_> hey ppl
[07:55] <ezenu3> I'm thinking about wiping out my old windows partition (dual boot). I don't know much about VMWare. Is it suitable for things like development with Visual Studio?
[07:56] <systemrestore> yeah ezenu3
[07:56] <systemrestore> now does 64 bit as well
[07:56] <Dheeraj_k> ezenu3: it will screw up ur pc
[07:56] <diskus> ezenu3: well vmware just emulates your PC
[07:56] <ezenu3> ...
[07:57] <edd_> how do u format a hard drive if u are currently running a distro???
[07:57] <jorgp> ezenu3, it works fine, however it requires lots of ram to be useful
[07:57] <jorgp> edd_, boot of the new distro cd?
[07:57] <ezenu3> I guess I will do it, and hopefully it doesn't screw up my PC, like Dheeraj_k  says
[07:58] <jorgp> it does not, using it all the time
[07:58] <ere> Anyone know how to change the resolution for vga-out? I use 1024x768 on LCD and get 1380x768 on the projector! I want 4:3 and 1024x768 on the projector too (and it supports that resolution)
[07:58] <Dheeraj_k> which version of visual studio u r using?
[07:58] <edd_> nah my mate wants to install windows bak on his pc from SUSE and if he tries to run from disc it goes 2 black screen, he wants to format the hdd
[07:58] <ezenu3> Dheeraj_k, will be using 2005, Enterprise edition
[07:59] <Dheeraj_k> if it is 2005 than u may need 2gb + ram to run visual studio in windows>>vmware>>ubuntu
[07:59] <ezenu3> Dheeraj_k, hmm.. well, I'll risk it. I don't like having that windows OS as bootable. may use xfce if needed, or buy more ram
[08:00] <gop> !ext
[08:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ext - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:00] <gop> !ext2
[08:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ext2 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:00] <Dheeraj_k> but i'll never recommend that but if u want to do it just for testing than it is ok
[08:01] <gop> One question, I tryed that driver for ext in windows, but for some reason it don't mount my ext drive
[08:01] <gop> windows won't even show the drive
[08:02] <Dheeraj_k> ezenu3: more ram will not help much u may need more processor :D
[08:03] <stojance> how do I install new fonts? Where should I copy /usr/share/fonts  ?
[08:03] <ezenu3> Dheeraj_k, well, I haven't booted to windows on my dual boot comp for maybe a year or two. so it should be fine as a backup
[08:03] <sysrage> !fonts

[08:04] <craigbass1976> Ayone know how to make an icon that will dial out for a regular user?  I gave him permission to establish a dial up connection, but nothing showed up in his menus
[08:04] <Dheeraj_k> ezenu3: wats wrong with using windows with ubunu?
[08:05] <tripper> hi. i'm using kubuntu 6.06LTS on my laptop. why does my system freeze each time i insert a usb flash disk?
[08:05] <bluefox83> craigbass1976, probably just be easier to create a launcher on the desktop...
[08:06] <tyrone> rbil: i uncommented/enabled the settings in the config files (both, client and sshd) as you said in your guide but when i try to start an X application from the client, i get "** CRITICAL **: Unable to open display". when i type -x or -X, nothing happens either- you know anything?
[08:06] <bluefox83> tripper, check out #kubuntu for the answer to that one
[08:06] <craigbass1976> bluefox83, right, but what does the launcher pointto?
[08:06] <tripper> i asked them. no one bothers to answer :)
[08:06] <gop> is any other way to mount ext3 in windows
[08:07] <bluefox83> craigbass1976, that will be up to you...i have no idea how to mess with dialup shit >.>
[08:07] <gop> !fs
[08:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:07] <ezenu3> Dheeraj_k, a few things.. like how my server is basically down (if anyone is trying to access intranet site, for example)
[08:07] <gop> !ifs
[08:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ifs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:07] <craigbass1976> bluefox83, well what's the interface config tool found in the system menu?  I can point to that.
[08:07] <minimec> How can it be that the network-manager is not on the live disk? What a stupid thing !!!
[08:08] <craigbass1976> bluefox83, but right clicking doesn't show a properties where I can find the path to the command
[08:08] <bluefox83> craigbass1976, no idea..i use cable...never used dialup in linux...
[08:08] <Arin> hello, could someone give me a hint why ffmpeg claims that there isnt xvid installed in the system ?
[08:08] <ajopaul_> hi am on edgy I was able to setup a svn 1.3.2 repo using apache2 for http but when I follow the same procedure for svn 1.4.0 i get the following eror
[08:08] <Dheeraj_k> ezenu3: didn't get u
[08:08] <craigbass1976> bluefox83, but there's a menu item that allows you to bring eth0 up and down, right?
[08:08] <rbil> tyrone: what does you commanline ssh command look like?
[08:08] <ajopaul_> $ svn co http://localhost/svn
[08:08] <ajopaul_>  svn: PROPFIND request failed on '/svn'
[08:08] <ajopaul_> svn: Could not open the requested SVN filesystem
[08:09] <ezenu3> Dheeraj_k, I use my ubuntu box for a lot of things, like samba shares, ssh access, apache2 server, mysql server. On windows, I have none of this. Thus, if I reboot to it, nobody can use my server's services
[08:09] <bluefox83> craigbass1976, if all you're doing is bringing up eth0 then just make the launcher run the command: ifconfig eth0 up
[08:09] <St3althy> hi i just installed ubuntu, now im online etc.. how do i setup LAMP
[08:10] <bluefox83> St3althy, whats LAMP?

[08:10] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP.

[08:10] <tyrone> rbil: "ssh tyrone@192.168.0.14"
[08:10] <St3althy> or can i just install it on ubuntu
[08:10] <bluefox83> St3althy, why don't you check out the link the bot just posted for you?
[08:11] <St3althy> ok
[08:11] <tyrone> rbil: i also restarted the ssh server
[08:11] <Dheeraj_k> ezenu3: all those packages r also available for windows
[08:11] <bluefox83> this is as bad as giving tech help to windows users, i swear to god >.>
[08:11] <rbil> tyrone: you may need to find out what DISPLAY the host is using, but try this first ...
[08:11] <ezenu3> Dheeraj_k, yes, but I'm not going to manage two installations of everything just for the rare times when I boot into windows every year or so
[08:11] <e3> Help...my ati radion 3d is choppy...i even reinstalled mesa library....opengl is being a meanie......

[08:12] <Peppery> Hi everyone. I don't need any help, I just wanted to say hi :|
[08:12] <Dheeraj_k> ezenu3: do u know about dev server suite? its all in 1
[08:12] <kjm> bluefox83 - getting close; but certainly not quite there yet.  Haven't had to deal with CometCursor or Bonzai buddy yet.....
[08:12] <ezenu3> e3, I don't know much about this, but if you run "fglrxinfo" in the console, does it say ATI?
[08:12] <bluefox83> kjm, the day they put bonzai buddy in linux is the day i commit suicide
[08:13] <e3> ENZENU3    no it says MESA is that bad
[08:13] <ezenu3> Dheeraj_k, no. Like I said, I don't feel its worth managing two installations for the rare times when I need to boot into that horrid OS
[08:13] <ezenu3> e3, yeah, it should say ATI
[08:13] <bluefox83> windows is out dated if you ask me :p
[08:13] <Dheeraj_k> by why u need to do that?
[08:13] <e3> I installed the ati propertary driver but it says MESA when i run fglrxinfo so should i reinstall ATI??
[08:13] <ezenu3> e3, maybe check out this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[08:14] <bluefox83> and by the time vista goes commercial release it wont be able to meet anything ubuntu or any other distro can do
[08:14] <Dheeraj_k> use windows only for visual studio
[08:14] <tyrone> rbil: there seems to be something wrong with the command you gave me: when i type the :0 directly after the ip, it says service not found. after correcting this it tried to connect to the server with my local user, not with tyrone :-(
[08:14] <Dheeraj_k> but for every thing else there is ubuntu :)
[08:14] <St3althy> ok so i need to re-install the os :( i was hoping i could just intall lamp now in ubuntu
[08:14] <bluefox83> Dheeraj_k, there are graphics proggies in linux...some of them are pretty good
[08:14] <Flannel> St3althy: you can
[08:14] <Flannel> !lamp | St3althy
[08:14] <ubotu> St3althy: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[08:15] <sootz> hye
[08:15] <rbil> tyrone: and X windows is running on the host machine?
[08:15] <sootz> hey*
[08:15] <bluefox83> St3althy, don't be retarded..of course you can just install LAMP
[08:15] <sootz> I could really use some help :P
[08:15] <tyrone> rbil: yes
[08:15] <e3> eznu thank you for the link, i've surfed through many how-to's on ati drivers but this one seems pretty good. i look forward to having a healthy machine :D
[08:15] <tyrone> rbil: xgl desktop
[08:15] <rbil> tyrone: hmmm, don't use xgl. maybe that's interferring somehow?
[08:16] <ezenu3> e3, yeah, that's the one I followed. Did you upgrade from dapper? I had to do a few extra steps to get fglrx working for that case
[08:16] <sootz> Is ubuntu on a laptop a bad idea?
[08:16] <sootz> xubuntu
[08:16] <Dheeraj_k>  bluefox83:  well i am using windows only for using visual studio and sql server and java dev
[08:16] <bluefox83> ...
[08:16] <rbil> tyrone: just not familiar with xgl desktops, btw, what does an ... echo $DISPLAY produce on the host box?
[08:16] <ezenu3> sootz, why would it be? as long as the hardware is supported
[08:16] <kernelabhishek> edgy not detecting eth0
[08:16] <bluefox83> Dheeraj_k, why? linux can do all of that...
[08:16] <e3> origionally i did upgrade from dapper, and my 3d worked awesome. but then i did a complete format of my harddrive and BAM the 3d is no go
[08:16] <sootz> Well ezunu
[08:16] <sootz> I have a linksys wireless G
[08:16] <sootz> card
[08:16] <sootz> I really hope its supported >_<
[08:16] <ezenu3> sootz, try running it as the live cd to test your hardware
[08:16] <bluefox83> sootz, probably is
[08:17] <Dheeraj_k> bluefox83: u must be joking?
[08:17] <sootz> yea, I'm downloading the LiveCD right now
[08:17] <sootz> Should I download xubuntu
[08:17] <sootz> or like..ubuntu
[08:17] <sootz> So confused >_<
[08:17] <kernelabhishek> edgy not detecting eth0
[08:17] <e3> my format included starting from edgy btw, i finally figured out how to burn a dvd ^_^
[08:17] <Dheeraj_k> microsoft is not providing linux version of mssql
[08:17] <St3althy> bluefox83 where
[08:17] <sonicchao> How do I use united states-international?
[08:17] <bluefox83> Dheeraj_k, no...there's plenty of linux software to develop java and run sql and do art work...google is your friend
[08:18] <sonicchao> To put accents over characters?
[08:18] <bluefox83> Dheeraj_k, use mysql?
[08:18] <sootz> ezenu3: what exactly should I download? xubuntu?
[08:18] <kernelabhishek> edgy not detecting eth0
[08:18] <rbil> sootz, depends on power of your machine. a newer machine will easily handle ubuntu's default gnome desktop
[08:18] <sootz> hmm
[08:18] <bluefox83> kernelabhishek, stop repeating yourself >.>
[08:18] <Dheeraj_k> mysql can't provide all the feature which is available in mssql2005
[08:18] <sonicchao> ' and e would make accented e, for instance
[08:18] <sootz> My laptop is a couple years old
[08:18] <sonicchao> How do I do that?
[08:18] <eclipse> etuel:~/wikipedia# cat mails2.txt |grep @
[08:18] <eclipse> asdasdasddsaadsasdsad mail@mail.com asidjasdijasdi
[08:18] <rbil> sootz, cpu and ram?
[08:19] <sootz> its about the equivelent to a 1.8ghz pentium 4
[08:19] <kernelabhishek> bluefox83: need answer
[08:19] <sootz> 512mb of RAM i believe
[08:19] <eclipse> how can I show mail@mail.com with grep in that example?
[08:19] <bluefox83> kernelabhishek, google it
[08:19] <kernelabhishek> bluefox83: help me please
[08:19] <rbil> sootz, should handle ubuntu without problems
[08:19] <ezenu3> sootz, should be fine... just enough
[08:19] <eclipse> only mail@mail.com
[08:19] <sootz> yay
[08:19] <Dheeraj_k> and mysql is not in our college course ware
[08:19] <ezenu3> sootz, mine is similar and it is running ubuntu fine right now
[08:19] <Arin> does someone here have experience with creating screencasts under ubuntu ?
[08:19] <sootz> Will running ubuntu make my battery last longer?
[08:19] <Rprp> Can someone help me? i installed lm-sensors etc,
[08:19] <Rprp> http://82.73.215.127/phpsysinfo/
[08:19] <Arin> with ffmpeg?
[08:19] <Rprp> But still its giving a error
[08:19] <Rprp> how cn i fix that
[08:19] <cold_fusion571> I have a newly built computer and want to install linux on it.. I tried ubuntu but the live disc wouldn't even boot to it.   Any ideas on why it won't boot?
[08:19] <e3> sootz yes because it wont eat cpu so much : p
[08:20] <sootz> cold fusion
[08:20] <sootz> Go into BIOS
[08:20] <sootz> Do you know how to go into BIOS cold fusion?
[08:20] <cold_fusion571> yes
[08:20] <bluefox83> Arin, screen casts? why are you perhaps on the crew of hak.5? >.>
[08:20] <sootz> and did you burn the CD with an ISO burner?
[08:20] <cold_fusion571> no
[08:20] <Rprp> please someone
[08:20] <sootz> What you need to do is go into BIOS, and like, boot options, and be sure that CD comes before HD on the list
[08:20] <sonicchao> You cannot accent characters in ubuntu?
[08:20] <Arin> bluefox83: what's the hak.5 ?
[08:20] <sonicchao> D=
[08:20] <e3> coldfusion it sounds like ur machine isnt even detectin the dvd..
[08:20] <cold_fusion571> I have done this
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[08:21] <gop> what the best way to upgrade
[08:21] <recon> I'm trying to compile something, but the make needs command "lex". What should I install, or which program should I change instead.
[08:21] <bluefox83> Arin, iptv for the bored hacker in all of us ;)
[08:21] <sootz> cold fusion, try reburning the CD with poweriso
=== mamonassassina is now known as rgg
[08:21] <sootz> redownload the ISO
[08:21] <sootz> and reburn
[08:21] <e3> magiciso works well too
[08:21] <cold_fusion571> I have tried installing fedora core 4  also..which installed on a diff. machine of mine..and it didn't go through the boot either
[08:21] <sootz> Then cold fusion
[08:21] <Arin> bluefox83: no, it's for my gf, she wants to make video tutorials for gimp community
[08:21] <sootz> Its probably either something in BIOS, or its your hardware
[08:21] <e3> cold_fusion i think the prob is hardware...?
[08:21] <bluefox83> cold_fusion571, set cdrom to be the first thing that boots in the boot sequence
[08:22] <rbil> cold_fusion571: did you download the iso and burn the cd?
[08:22] <e3> cold_fus try booting a different cd not ubuntu
[08:22] <cold_fusion571> yes... probably hardware.. it is very new Motherboard and CPU
[08:22] <rgg> hello people,i have a nvidia geforce fx5200 card with tv-out,and i have the nvidia drivers too.well,how can i make tv-out work?
[08:22] <sootz> cold fus
[08:22] <ezenu3> recon, you might try "sudo apt-get build-dep your-package" to get any build dependencies. or maybe you need to "sudo apt-get install build-essentials"
[08:22] <cold_fusion571> I have tried others
[08:22] <sootz> Try booting windows XP
[08:22] <Azoff> hello
[08:22] <e3> i wouldnt use ubuntu bootable to test a new machine..some would.
[08:22] <Rprp> Can someone help me? i installed lm-sensors etc,
[08:22] <sootz> then fusion, its probably a hardware issue
[08:22] <Rprp> But still its giving a error
[08:22] <Rprp> http://82.73.215.127/phpsysinfo/
[08:22] <Rprp> how can i fix that?
[08:22] <rgg> of course,everything is properly connected.
[08:22] <bluefox83> Arin, good luck..i would stay and help but i need to leave
[08:23] <shuan> anyone know how to install aiglx?
[08:23] <recon> ezenu3: my package is trek73 (isn't in repository), and build esseintials is already installed.
[08:23] <cold_fusion571> sootz do you know any version that would allow me to get around the hardware issue, whether it be a driver ...etc..
[08:23] <e3> cold_fus, try an external dvd reader for awhile to see if it boots
[08:23] <Azoff> I am about to install a KDE desktop and one with GNOME, if I use the a dvd, am I able to select the KDE part and the GNOME part from the same disc? or do I still need both the Ubuntu DVD and the KUbuntu DVD?
[08:23] <erpo> Hi. Can I use a linux box as a switch, but still run squid on it?
[08:24] <e3> I believe KDE and Ubuntu are not on same dvd
[08:24] <gnomefreak> e3: nope
[08:24] <ezenu3> recon, I'm not sure, but you could try installing "flex"
[08:24] <sonicchao> ...
[08:24] <VSpike> solid_liq: your xorg.conf works.. thanks :) But I still can't load the KDE control centre monitor & display tool
[08:24] <gnomefreak> e3: they are not but you can install either from repos
[08:24] <Azoff> so, what's the additional gigs on the DVD for then?
[08:24] <sonicchao> How do I use the united states-international keyboard layout?
[08:24] <gnomefreak> Azoff: other packages
[08:25] <recon> ezenu3: I'll see if I can find anything good.
[08:25] <Azoff> hm
[08:25] <gnomefreak> Azoff: off hand im not sure if kubuntu-desktop is on dvd
[08:25] <recon> yeah, flex should do it, ezenu3.
[08:25] <Azoff> gnomefreak: it is, it's downloading ATM
[08:25] <ezenu3> recon, ok, good
[08:25] <gnomefreak> Azoff: ok
[08:25] <e3> sonicchao u might be able to reconfig xorg thingy from terminal..?
[08:26] <Azoff> gnomefreak: anyway, are there any other simple way (I am going to demonstrate the installation) that I could use the same disc?
[08:26] <sonicchao> I have no idea how to do that. >.>
[08:26] <VSpike> solid_liq: output from kcmshell displayconfig is at http://pastebin.cross-lfs.org/382
[08:26] <sonicchao> I just need accented characters.
[08:26] <Azoff> or should I realy need to burn two discs?
[08:26] <gnomefreak> Azoff: after installing on just apt-get the other one
[08:26] <recon> ezenu3: now to find yacc. As soon as i finish getting this, I am going to port this to a debian package.
[08:26] <ajopaul_> is there a howto i can refer to setup a svn 1.4 with http on a ubuntu? i get svn: Could not open the requested SVN filesystem error although setting svn 1.3.2 was fine!
[08:26] <sonicchao> ~n makes well, I can't make it can I? it makes n with tilda
[08:27] <sonicchao> I just need to be able to do that.
[08:27] <gnomefreak> Azoff: if on same partition just use apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[08:27] <recon> ezenu3: Excuse my ranting, but bison is yacc.
[08:27] <Azoff> gnomefreak: yeah, but then there will be all the GNOME stuff (for ex.) on the KDE one
[08:27] <gnomefreak> or ubuntu-desktop
[08:27] <e3> from terminal: "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"   that gives keyboard/graphics options..
[08:27] <solid_liq> VSpike: he unbanned you?
[08:27] <yacc> recon: in most cases ;)
[08:27] <sonicchao> And I know what to do from there?
[08:27] <sonicchao> ...
[08:27] <sonicchao> ...
[08:27] <sonicchao> no.
[08:27] <VSpike> solid_liq: someone did :)
[08:27] <azion> !codecs
[08:27] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[08:28] <solid_liq> VSpike: cool.  I actually just modified your xorg.conf file
[08:28] <recon> yacc: It figures. Somebody with a nick of yacc knows which package provides command yacc.
[08:28] <Azoff> gnomefreak: oki, I'll put it this way then, could I from a DVD install the minimal system and then be able to apt-get the destop packages?
[08:28] <yacc> recon: I wouldn't bet that all the advanced stuff like reentrant parsers are compatible, because I exactly had to redo that stuff to port an app to Linux ;)
[08:28] <Azoff> and preferly have most of them on disc
[08:28] <gnomefreak> Azoff: yes i dont see why not
[08:28] <cold_fusion571> My computer will not complete install of fedora core4, ubuntu, or mandriva linux.. probably a hardware issue.  Does anyone know if there is a way to still install linux?
[08:28] <kjm> !codecs > azion
[08:28] <sonicchao> So, in an 'international' operating system, there is no way to make accented characters?
[08:28] <yacc> cold_fusion571: Where does it stop?
[08:28] <sonicchao> (lol loophole)
[08:29] <recon> has anybody had luck compiling a trek73 port (like the one at http://trek.kermitmurray.com/)?
[08:29] <e3> cold-fus you might be able to copy a harddrive of a working machine
[08:29] <Azoff> gnomefreak: I have not installed ubuntu since 5.x so I can't remember if there were any choise about to install gnome or not from the ubuntu disc
[08:29] <cold_fusion571> after the initial menu when you choose either graphical install or not, once you start the install
[08:29] <VSpike> solid_liq: I don't really speak python, but it looks to me like the tool is breaking because it's expecting a line in the device section like 'BusID "PCI:1:4:0"'
[08:30] <tyrone> rbil: sorry i was getting a hotdog :-) still around? echo $DISPLAY gives me a blank line on the host box
[08:30] <Azoff> maybe I sould just test it instead of asking questins here =)
[08:30] <gnomefreak> Azoff: off hand i dont know but i dont see why not
[08:30] <VSpike> solid_liq: yeah I saw - just added some display modes.  I diffed it with my original
[08:30] <e3> cold-fus what happens, does it freez
[08:30] <yacc> cold_fusion571: Does Knoppix run on your hardware?
[08:30] <cold_fusion571> have not tied knoppix and it stops install..comes up with some error I believe.. and reboots machine
[08:30] <e3> yea knoppix and BartPE (windows preinstall environment) boot well
[08:31] <Azoff> gnomefreak: I guess I could always debootstrap ubuntu, but that's not wat I wanna show the people I'm gonna help with this ;-)
[08:31] <Azoff> what even
[08:31] <cold_fusion571> I think I tried BartPE and it did not work
[08:31] <solid_liq> VSpike: hmm, not sure about that one
[08:31] <gnomefreak> Azoff: what exactly do you want to show people?
[08:31] <sonicchao> What's the point having UTF8 then?
[08:31] <sonicchao> XD
[08:31] <rbil> tyrone, yes still here ... yummy a hotdog! my favorite food ... problem if it doesn't tell u what display it is using
[08:31] <Azoff> gnomefreak: how easy it is to install Linux and use it =)
[08:31] <e3> cold-fus what are you using for a computer X.x;
[08:31] <debianos> hy.i need help about icecast.xml configuration
[08:31] <cold_fusion571> Windows is already installed..is that an issue?
[08:31] <sonicchao> May as well use Latin-1, or better yet, DOS
[08:31] <rbil> tyrone, but I don't know why this is happening, sorry
[08:32] <cld2> I just upgraded to 6.10, can someone tell me how to get an SMP 686 kernel? thanks.
[08:32] <gnomefreak> Azoff: than why do you want to install both kde and gnome just install one (they are same installer) and apt-get install the other one to show them how to install from repos
[08:32] <gnomefreak> cld2: get the generic kernel
[08:32] <cold_fusion571> Core 2 duo E6600, Asus P5B Deluxe wifi edition MOBO, Corsair 2GB DDR 800 RAM
[08:32] <debianos> please,information about icecast2
[08:32] <solid_liq> VSpike: sorry, I don't really have time right now to help ya fix that
[08:32] <e3>  some people prefer to duel boot kde and gnome on different partitions to keep things 'clean' and prevent a few errors
[08:32] <rbil> tyrone, I think you'll need to seek help from someone familiar with xgl.
[08:33] <tyrone> rbil: only thing i can tell is that DISPLAY=:0 starts a process on top of my current X
[08:33] <solid_liq> VSpike: maybe later today I will if you haven't figured it out yet
[08:33] <tyrone> rbil: ok then. but thanks so far
[08:33] <VSpike> solid_liq: no probs - just wanted to report that the config file worked :)
[08:33] <Azoff> gnomefreak: because the harddrive space is limited and the system are going to get left on the systems
[08:33] <Azoff> and hopefully used
[08:33] <Azoff> :-)
[08:33] <cld2> gnomefreak: I have the generic but its not seeing my second core
[08:33] <VSpike> solid_liq: anyway, i've been meaning to learn python ;)
[08:33] <solid_liq> VSpike: I'm not sure Python is involved tho
[08:33] <e3> cold-fus i dont know much about that new of hardware (u lucky hobo) but try taking out a mem chip?? I give up lol
[08:33] <solid_liq> VSpike: python is a really cool language
[08:33] <cold_fusion571> lol...thanks for the help
[08:34] <solid_liq> VSpike: really easy to pick up too
[08:34] <VSpike> solid_liq: the control panel modules appear to be written in python
[08:34] <sonicchao> I've never seen a *coughstupidercough* way to change keyboard settings, all over a few characters. :PPP
[08:34] <gnomefreak> Azoff: than your best off downloading both install cds kubuntu and ubuntu
[08:34] <solid_liq> VSpike: what languages do you know now?
[08:34] <Azoff> gnomefreak: ok
[08:34] <rbil> tyrone, if you ever find out solution and see me around in future, I'd like to hear about it
[08:34] <nikin> can someone help me with gettink JAVA work with Konqueror?
[08:35] <Azoff> gnomefreak: I'll guess I'll do that. thanks for your time
[08:35] <solid_liq> VSpike: I doubt they are.  The kde team is usually very opposed to requiring people to have an interpreter for any language installed, only like leaving it as an option
[08:35] <solid_liq> VSpike: and kde is all C++
[08:35] <Azoff> see you tomorrow if I get into trouble ;-)
[08:35] <tyrone> rbil: i will let you know then. thanks again
[08:35] <VSpike> solid_liq: C#, Delphi, VB6, and a while ago C++ & C
[08:35] <e3> anyone know if gnome3 or kde4 are collaborating on anything?
[08:35] <recon> OK, i'm trying to compile a package, and errors come up with the "lex" and "yacc" command. IT's all at http://rafb.net/paste/results/vlp1mK44.html. Help appreciated.
[08:35] <spacecat> good evening
[08:35] <VSpike> solid_liq: I've tinkered with Python a bit... was actually gonna learn Ruby instead but I'm easy either way
[08:35] <leafw> any way to add keyboard shortcuts to thunderbird?
[08:35] <rbil> tyrone, maybe try googling on ssh+xgl
[08:36] <solid_liq> VSpike: well, kde is all C++, so maybe if you look through the sources you'll get some hints
[08:36] <Azoff> gnomefreak: btw, what does edubuntu come with for WM?
[08:36] <spacecat> anyone advice on mobos for an edgy core2duo setup ?
[08:36] <gnomefreak> Azoff: gnome
[08:36] <solid_liq> VSpike: kde.org has a web based version control viewing tool
[08:36] <solid_liq> VSpike: anyway, gotta go, good luck
[08:36] <Azoff> gnomefreak: ok
[08:37] <sonicchao> lol
[08:37] <sonicchao> The keyboard preferences have NO WAY TO ADD UNITEDSTATES-INTERNATIONAL
[08:37] <sonicchao> Thus making it easily impossible to accent letters
[08:37] <PepperBob> hey all. i'm running dapper and i'm curious if i can upgrade gcc 4.0.3 to gcc 4.1.1
[08:37] <PepperBob> any hints?
[08:37] <mikeconcepts> a close friend need help with the power save feature in ubuntu dapper or edgy, there appears to be no way to prevent ubuntu from going into or getting out of power save mode, even though it is turned off every way I know of
[08:37] <mikeconcepts> need help
[08:38] <e3> bob get edgy come on man :p
[08:38] <PepperBob> e3: no i love the dapper
[08:38] <mikeconcepts> tried adding the typical switches to grub already
[08:38] <e3> nooooo get edgy
[08:38] <sonicchao> The update to edgy is crap :3
[08:38] <e3> then dont update : p
[08:38] <mikeconcepts> is this a known issue on some old hardware?
[08:38] <Discerer> my computer locks up whenever the power save or screen saver starts... try deactivating it :p
[08:38] <shwag> where might a find a list of packages installed on my system, sorted by date installed ?
[08:38] <sonicchao> And I bet also has no way to accent anything :3
[08:39] <PepperBob> e3: i guess i just need to add the edgy repos to my sources  list, to get gcc 4.1.1 right?
[08:39] <ere> Anyone know how to change the resolution for vga-out? I use 1024x768 on LCD and get 1380x768 on the projector! I want 4:3 and 1024x768 on the projector too (and it supports that resolution)
[08:39] <e3> whew im too much of a newbie to know about repos
[08:39] <Azoff> bye
[08:39] <PepperBob> e3: oh-ha! ;)
[08:39] <budluva> anyone aware of any faster ways to convert xvid to dvd than TOVID??? i let it run last night and took 5 1/2 hours to encode an 1 1/2 video, usually takes about an 1 1/2 to convert and burn in windows on this machine
[08:39] <sonicchao> e3: and you tried to help me dpkg-configure?
[08:40] <sonicchao> ...
[08:40] <e3> ere did u use the graphical interface in xorg thing on terminal to change resolution
[08:40] <sonicchao> Good thing I followed none of your directions.
[08:40] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: thats not a good idea to mix repos
[08:40] <nikin> how can i stop my sowncard sending MASTER back to RECORD?
[08:40] <PepperBob> gnomefreak: well i know - basically it's just the gcc that i want to have. and i see no other option so far.
[08:40] <e3> gnomefreak thank u for saving me from pretending to know what im talkin about
[08:41] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: get it from packages.ubuntu.com but if it depends on libc6 dont touch it
[08:41] <sonicchao> >> The the ubuntu community is people, keyword: PRETENDING, to know what they are talking about?
[08:41] <nikin> PepperBob: ever tried DevC?
[08:41] <PepperBob> gnomefreak: i'm pretty sure it depends on libc6
[08:41] <PepperBob> nikin: no?
[08:41] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: no it doesnt
[08:41] <e3> soniccahao ur part of this community : p
[08:41] <shwag> can someone tell me about aptitude ?
[08:42] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: it only depends on cpp
[08:42] <sonicchao> I have no idea what the hell I am doing
[08:42] <gnomefreak> shwag: its a more powerful apt
[08:42] <sonicchao> the keyboard settings are crap
[08:42] <nolimitsoya> k3b is supposed to burn .bin as far as i can see, but cdrdao gives error 2 when i try. do i need something other what gets installed when apt-getting k3b?
[08:42] <shwag> gnomefreak: do you use it ?
[08:42] <gnomefreak> shwag: yes
[08:42] <nolimitsoya> *than
[08:42] <nikin> PepperBob: i have not tested it yet, but there is DevC for linux, yet 0.7 or so
[08:42] <shwag> gnomefreak: what is something I might want to use it for ?
[08:42] <philipsmith> Hi. I want to make realplayer 10 my default audio player. How do I do this?
[08:43] <PepperBob> gnomefreak: it does depend on libc6
[08:43] <gnomefreak> shwag: if you want to install a package and its recommended and suggested packages (also for -desktop packages
[08:43] <e3> the peperbob ur outta luck unless u get edgy *glee*
[08:43] <gnomefreak> Depends: cpp (>= 4:4.1.1-14ubuntu1), gcc-4.1 (>= 4.1.1-2)
[08:43] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: no it doesnt
[08:43] <gnomefreak> apt-cache show will show you
[08:43] <Kr3w> i need help to install linux, i'm on raid and i see my two 80gig HD how can i install my "raid driver"
[08:44] <sonicchao> mg, after an idiotic amount of time, I figured out how to accent things.
[08:44] <spacecat> no core2duo processor users here?
[08:44] <sonicchao> *cough FINALLY cough*
[08:44] <sonicchao> XP was much easier.
[08:44] <sonicchao> And that all I have to say.
[08:44] <cld2> on 6.10 what linux/kernel package do I need to install to get 686 and SMP support? I have linux-image-generic installed but Im not getting smp support. thanks.
[08:44] <e3> sonicho explain please!
[08:44] <sonicchao> And why the  accents I have no idea. lol
[08:44] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: if it is asking for it show me. it recommended libc6-dev
[08:44] <e3> sonicchao how did u do it
[08:44] <PepperBob> gnomefreak: yes ^
[08:44] <sonicchao> System -> Preferences Keyboard
[08:44] <sonicchao> ->*
[08:44] <Kr3w> i need help to install linux, i'm on raid and i see my two 80gig HD how can i install my "raid driver" ? please
[08:45] <sonicchao> 'layouts'
[08:45] <sonicchao> Add...
[08:45] <sonicchao> *insert 5 minutes of opening all the idiotic arrows here*
[08:45] <e3> More technical talk, less jibber jabber!
[08:45] <sonicchao> 'US English'
[08:45] <soundray> cld2: how have you determined that you have no SMP support?
[08:45] <sonicchao> 'international with dead keys'
[08:46] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: hmmm seems someone screwed up on my packages and didnt list it as a depends
[08:46] <sonicchao> OK
[08:46] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: do not install it
[08:46] <Kr3w> can someone help me goddam..
[08:46] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: if you want it either build it or upgrade to edgy
[08:46] <sonicchao> *insert five minutes of figuring out why it didn't work here*
[08:46] <gnomefreak> Kr3w: watch your language
[08:46] <soundray> Kr3w: now that you're swearing at us, sure.
[08:46] <PepperBob> gnomefreak: upgrade to edgy broke the complete system so that not what i wanted to do...
[08:47] <gnomefreak> PepperBob: than try to build it if you want it.
[08:47] <sonicchao> click 'US English International (with dead keys)', and press "UP".
[08:47] <Kr3w> lol im not swearing at you i ask two times for help and no one reply
[08:47] <e3> pepperbob ur too determined.... u must be dealt with.... try getting edgy to work on another partition..
[08:47] <soundray> !patience | Kr3w
[08:47] <ubotu> Kr3w: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[08:47] <sonicchao> e3: that is how.
[08:48] <sonicchao> Oh, but even it has limits. It inserts accents over nonsensical characters, eg:
[08:48] <sonicchao> 
[08:48] <Kr3w> can someone help me with my raid in linux please.
[08:48] <sonicchao> If they made one that just:  I would have it made
[08:48] <sonicchao> For spanish. =3
[08:48] <soundray> sonicchao: there are obviously languages that you haven't heard of.
[08:49] <PepperBob> e3: the point is: i need gcc 4.1 running on dapper and not edgy. that's why it is no option to me upgrading to edgy (btw that upgrading already freaked my system).
[08:49] <e3> sonicchao u could always spend a zillion dollers on bloaty VISTA and port the accents stuff to edgy
[08:49] <sonicchao> I have XP for one.
[08:49] <PepperBob> Kr3w: what's your problem?
[08:49] <Vlet> Sorry, random question... Anyone know of a client/server to remotely browse and stream videos? Democracy doesn't stream avi's, and it's channels are linear, not structured.
[08:49] <minimec> Vlet: Mythtv
[08:50] <sonicchao> soundray, that is not the issue. My main problem is that they should have one just for spanish alone. Why? It would not be hard, you have to remove stuff, not add it
[08:50] <Kr3w> PepperBob i try to install linux on my raid 0 system and i can just see my two 80HD and not the Partition i made for linux
[08:50] <tyrone> rbil: "ssh -X user:host" allows me to run applications on the server and view their gui on my client box, which definetly is what i was looking for :-)
[08:50] <Vlet> minimec: oooh yeah, thanks
[08:50] <minimec> Vlet: np
[08:50] <PepperBob> Kr3w: what raid? software raid? why manufacturer?
[08:50] <PepperBob> s/why/what
[08:50] <rbil> well the setting in client config should have given u the same thing as -X, but glad to hear u got it working
[08:51] <nikin> tyrone: what kind of connection is between the 2 comps?
[08:51] <mwe> I removed a package from kubuntu-desktop and thus the meta package was removed as well. Now apt-get tells me the rest are marked as automatically installed and that I can use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them. How do I tell apt that I want to keep them and it shouldn't warn me all the time??
[08:51] <nelhage> How do I change my window manager using gnome-session?
[08:51] <rbil> tyrone: using -X is equivalent to X11Forwarding yes
[08:51] <Kr3w> PepperBob You know raid ? like two 80HD become 160gig and its more faster
=== sonicchao is now known as SonicChao
[08:51] <Kr3w> PepperBob the manufacturer is Nvidia
[08:51] <tyrone> nikin: ssh
[08:52] <nikin> tyrone: i mean LAN, or WAN?
[08:52] <tyrone> nikin: which actually works pretty nice
[08:52] <nikin> and what speed?
[08:52] <tyrone> nikin: lan
[08:52] <e3> sonic thank you for nick change, ur name was hard to spell : p
[08:52] <SonicChao> But it fine now
[08:52] <tyrone> nikin: 100mbit
[08:52] <soundray> sonicchao: the fact that the accent dead key accentuates any character for which there is an accentuated equivalent makes perfect sense to me. If you have such strong opinions, get involved in package maintenance.
[08:52] <SonicChao> I just wish that s would not accent
[08:52] <SonicChao> :P
[08:52] <nikin> tyrone: ok :D:D , i was playing with 10 Mbit Lan, and had many speed isues
[08:52] <SonicChao> that = that's
[08:52] <SonicChao> Just one issue.
[08:52] <PepperBob> Kr3w: if you run lspci
[08:53] <tyrone> nikin: oh sorry i'm using wifi atm- 54mbit but i think i put iwconfig to use 1M because of bad link
[08:53] <SonicChao> the others I really do not care about
[08:53] <PepperBob> Kr3w: does it say anything more specific about the raid controller?
[08:53] <soundray> SonicChao: meantime, use the accent and the space bar to get an apostrophe, or define yourself an apostrophe key.
[08:53] <tyrone> nikin: i have much less then 10m atm :-)
[08:53] <nikin> tyrone: 1M and its working?
[08:53] <tyrone> yep
[08:53] <tyrone> no lag
[08:53] <nikin> i use 11Mbps Wlan, and have about 5 Mbps in real
[08:53] <SonicChao> Of course,  is not an issue in espaol...
[08:53] <Kr3w> PepperBob sorry i'm nor on linux right now i will try and come back on linux
[08:53] <Kr3w> not
[08:53] <rbil> tyrone: neat thing it uses the host's apps window
[08:53] <SonicChao> soundray, how do I 'define' an apostrophe?
[08:54] <rbil> widow decorations
[08:54] <PepperBob> Kr3w: is this an Asus Board?
[08:54] <nikin> then i maybe f*ed up something
[08:54] <Kr3w> PepperBob Yes
[08:54] <soundray> SonicChao: I don't know, the need hasn't arisen for me so far.
[08:54] <nikin> tyrone: do you know any Texts about the topic?
[08:54] <PepperBob> Kr3w: which one?
[08:54] <tyrone> rbil: i think it does. i can't proof
[08:54] <tyrone> rbil: i just have the window here
[08:54] <SonicChao> soundray, You aren multilingual, huh? :D That is okay :3
[08:55] <Kr3w> PepperBob p5n32-sli deluxe
[08:55] <rbil> tyrone: it does, i ssh many times to other distros and get their windows
[08:55] <soundray> SonicChao: I am, in fact.
[08:55] <SonicChao> Il figure it out someday
[08:55] <tyrone> nikin: no only things i know about it are in this chatlog
[08:55] <SonicChao> Oh and  is an issue
[08:55] <SonicChao> soundray, what languages?
[08:55] <soundray> SonicChao: that's the attitude.
[08:55] <e3> Sonic you'll be in here all day trying to get this accent thing working. : P   which is awesome, but also try the forums they are slow but have great support.
[08:55] <Hausberg> what do I need to insert in grub/menu.lst in order to turn noexec=off
[08:55] <rbil> goodbye folks
[08:55] <Hausberg> is this ok?
[08:55] <nikin> tyrone, i just arrived about 15 minutes ago
[08:55] <nikin> :(

[08:55] <SonicChao> Accents are important. You can't say espaol without the ~.
[08:55] <SonicChao> :P
[08:55] <soundray> SonicChao: German, English and un peu de French. But we're going offtopic.
[08:56] <SonicChao> soundray, I know :P
[08:56] <tyrone> rbil: nice. i think ssh is kind of fascinating
[08:56] <tyrone> nikin: ok what would you like to know?
[08:56] <Kr3w> vous parlez francais
[08:56] <SonicChao> or l without the ', etc.
[08:56] <Q-FUNK> my Atheros PCMCIA card under Edgy only seems to find half the networks that others on Mac/Win do, it gets a systematically lower signal strenght as them and it fails to get an IP half the time too.
[08:56] <soundray> SonicChao: not that anyone would be in grave danger of misreading you if you said "espanol", at least on IRC.
[08:56] <nikin> tyrone: just about how to set that up
[08:56] <kditty> how do i change permission for the folder /home/kditty/Desktop/video_ts so i can delete it? right now its read only
[08:56] <SonicChao> soundray, what about the qu and que example?
[08:57] <SonicChao> Qu means What, while que means that
[08:57] <nikin> i have a console based ssh up and running
[08:57] <SonicChao> You could probably take a guess, but still
[08:57] <nikin> and a server with Xfce installed
[08:57] <e3> KDITTY have you typed sudo natulis (spelling err..) in terminal
[08:57] <emilia> hey guys, i did df -h, and it says im using 32/36gb, but im on a week old installation, and i havent downloaded anything, is there some temp files somewhere i can clear?
[08:57] <soundray> SonicChao: you've found out how Ubuntu provides for that. Sorry it took you a while.
[08:57] <coredata> sup
[08:57] <Kr3w> Bonjour
[08:57] <kditty> e3, yes but i still can not delete that folder
[08:57] <gnomefreak> e3: gksudo natilus
[08:58] <gnomefreak> damn
[08:58] <ramvi> How do I downgrade my distro?
[08:58] <coredata> ?
[08:58] <emilia> maybe from cd's ive burned?
[08:58] <SonicChao> soundray, Yes, I know, I just wish I could turn off some accents, but I will ask on the forums :)
[08:58] <emilia> but i always do them on the fly....
[08:58] <soundray> !downgrade | ramvi
[08:58] <ubotu> ramvi: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[08:58] <gnomefreak> nautilus
[08:58] <tyrone> nikin: first of all you need to install the ssh-server packet on the box you wish to run it on. then you have to configure it to use X11 forwarding. rbil was so kind to hand me out his guide on it: http://customdesign.homelinux.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=21 . then you go to your client box and type in "ssh -X user@serverip"
[08:58] <toHotWep> how do i get my use this line rihgt it say invail  /modpci
[08:58] <ramvi> eww
[08:59] <kditty> it happened when i mounted an iso file to use dvdshrink on it, now i cant get rid of that folder, but godfather2 mounted as a disk with an un-mount option on right click
[08:59] <soundray> ramvi: backup and reinstall.
[08:59] <waddler> any ideas why i would get "cannot create -filename- no such file or directory " when i start a torrent with ktorrent?
[08:59] <ramvi> soundray, thanks :)
[08:59] <nikin> tyrone: thanx a lot, i will go and see the docs and come back with the results

[09:00] <SonicChao> !lamp > St3althy
[09:01] <SonicChao> haha I still remember some of these commands =P
[09:01] <tyrone> nikin: you only need the guide to look up the changes you've got to make in the ssh_config and sshd_config (sshd is the server, ssh the client config)
[09:01] <soundray> St3althy: read the pm that ubotu sent.
[09:01] <mrlinux_> i need help getting my dhcp configerd

[09:08] <cheeseboy> soundtray i dont kno what type of card it is
[09:08] <e3> Soundray do you think it would be ok to have both DISABLE and 0 at the end of my xorg.conf file??
[09:08] <soundray> !lamp | St3althy
[09:08] <ubotu> St3althy: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.

[09:09] <stojance> I get a really nasty problem with Firefox 2.0, when I click on the icon it doesn't start, when I do it from terminal I get the following output: /usr/lib/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 21825 Segmentation fault      "$prog" ${1+"$@"}. How can I fix this?
[09:09] <jason> vicox,   i would also like to know
[09:10] <nikin> tyrone : i made the settings
[09:10] <soundray> cheeseboy: it looks like it is a bt878 card. Please check 'lsmod | grep bt878
[09:10] <Kr3w> can someone help me with my RAID
[09:10] <St3althy> soundray: do i instal it through synaptic package manager?
[09:10] <soundray> cheeseboy: it looks like it is a bt878 card. Please check 'lsmod | grep bt878'. If there is output, the driver is already loaded.
[09:10] <eperrel> Hello, is there anyone who can help me with a problem in version 6.10
[09:10] <nikin> but have problems
[09:11] <jove> has anyone managed to get vlc to play the h264 video streams from americafree.tv?
[09:11] <HymnToLife> !helpme > eperrel
[09:11] <stojance> When I don't do it from the /usr/lib... directory it works fine.
[09:11] <nikin> do i need a running X server on the server side?
[09:11] <tyrone> nikin: you can start restart and stop the sshd on your server box by "sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start; restart; stop
[09:11] <tyrone> nikin: but when you installed the server packet it should start automatically after
[09:11] <mwe> stojance: and you are just using the firefox that ubuntu provides?
[09:11] <PepperBob> Kr3w: yes.
[09:12] <budluva> stojance, try re-installing maybe?
[09:12] <soundray> St3althy: sorry, all the information is on that page. I can't see the benefit of me reading it for you.
[09:12] <Kr3w> PepperBob ok so im on linux right now
[09:12] <nikin> tyrone: i didnt need to do any changes, forwarding was enabled in sshd_config
[09:12] <PepperBob> Kr3w: run lspci to see if there are more details about the raid controller
[09:12] <cheeseboy> soundray that command doesnt do anything
[09:12] <Kr3w> PepperBob yes theres alot of thing..
[09:12] <stojance> mwe: no! the new firefox 2.0. It worked for me when it first got out...
[09:12] <tyrone> nikin: nice. does it work??
[09:12] <St3althy> soundray: i went to add/remove
[09:12] <St3althy> like it says
[09:12] <nikin> tyrone: its installed alredy from begin, i use console based ssh dayly
[09:13] <nikin> tyrone: no
[09:13] <St3althy> and apache is not there
[09:13] <Kr3w> PepperBob like RAID bus controller: nVidia Corporation CK804 Serial ATA Controller
[09:13] <PepperBob> Kr3w: can you paste the output somehwere?
[09:13] <PepperBob> Kr3w: okay.
[09:13] <nikin> i get : cannot open display (null)
[09:13] <soundray> cheeseboy: then the drivers aren't loaded. Is the card plugged in? Is it a PCI card?
[09:13] <mwe> stojance: you probably messed up the links. how did you install it?

[09:13] <tyrone> nikin: :-( did you put "ssh -X user@host"?
[09:13] <eperrel> Since upgrading to 6.10 my web browser often shuts down when simply typing in a new website or logging into a password protected site, such as my gmail account.
[09:13] <cheeseboy> soundray yes it is pci and yes its plugged in

[09:14] <nikin> does -x and -X difer?
[09:14] <soundray> cheeseboy: can you see it with lspci ?
[09:14] <stojance> mwe: You unpack the tar.gz and then just move the folder to the previous firefox installation such as /usr/lib
[09:14] <soundray> nikin: slightly. One turns X forwarding off, the other turns it on.
[09:15] <cheeseboy> sondray, no
[09:15] <nikin> i did with -X
[09:15] <nikin> and get same
[09:15] <nikin> i thinnk i did the first time with X to
[09:15] <stojance> BTW why can't you install AIGLX on Ubuntu Dapper when it's on the wiki?
[09:16] <soundray> cheeseboy: okay, this is a low level problem. Check that your card is seated properly in the PCI slot. It may be worth putting it in another slot.
[09:16] <stojance> Can someone please send me the deb package of firefox that is in Edgy?

[09:16] <bradley__> when i drag and drop themes that i have downloaded they don't seem to install correctly.  how would i fix this problem?
[09:17] <nikin> i have changed the videocard in the server yesterday, can hat couse the  problem
[09:17] <cheeseboy> soundray, i just used it on windows
[09:17] <tyrone> sry ^^
[09:17] <soundray> tyrone: but yes, Solaris is a flavor of unix.
[09:17] <stojance> tyrone: ja
[09:17] <tyrone> :-x
[09:17] <nikin> and do i need a running x server to the stuff to work?
[09:18] <craigbass1976> I want to make a desktop icon to dial up.  /usr/bin/network-admin is what I want to link to.  Do I change group ownership of that file and put the desired user in that group, or is there a better way to have a regular user (without sudoing or entering a password of any kind) bring the dial up connection up and down?
[09:18] <[emo] rapha> There is no Q3 color code for gray :(
[09:19] <stojance> What is topaz like on gnome-look?
[09:19] <Kr3w> PepperBob so what going on
[09:19] <soundray> craigbass1976: it would be better to create a fifo with write access for dialup users and use that to bring the connection up.
[09:19] <tyrone> nikin: i don't know if this makes a change. i am using ati vga on both, the server and client
[09:19] <soundray> craigbass1976: diald would set it all up for you, I think

[09:21] <nikin> how can i reconfigure X server for new VGA card?
[09:21] <cheeseboy> soundray, why isnt my tv tuner card dected?
[09:22] <PepperBob> Kr3w: please paste the output of uname -a
[09:22] <soundray> cheeseboy: if you can't see the card with lspci, it means that the kernel can't see it. If it could, it would probably be supported. But right now, the problem is below the level of software drivers.
[09:22] <soundray> cheeseboy: I would try another PCI slot.

[09:28] <PepperBob> Kr3w: as it's a software raid, i believe you have to create a device first...
[09:28] <soundray> zch: it wasn't from the logs, just an educated guess.
[09:29] <bat> what?
[09:29] <Kr3w> Pepperbob how ?
[09:29] <zch> soundray: yeah i was swapping just the new card around, and it didn't worked, at the end i had to pull out the old adapter and swap em around pci slots

[09:37] <nikin> and didnt pay atention to reconfigure the x server coz i almost never use it
[09:38] <soundray> Halpo: I thought you meant the source code to the top program. top is provided by the procps package.
[09:38] <nikin> in the server
[09:38] <toHotWep> i like Happy root
[09:38] <nikin> so i did a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:38] <nikin> and after that its working
[09:38] <zch> soundray: so, not knowing that, i installed firestarter and got "cannot open display" error :)
[09:39] <soundray> zch: are you connecting to your server through ssh?
[09:39] <zch> yes i am now ssh-ed to my server over windows machine and chatting from bitchx
[09:39] <gottatrieit> Can any one tell me if Debian is behind in updates or upgrades? I checked their home page for OpenOffice and all that was there was saying OpenOffice 2.0 was unstable, but the OO.org website is up to release 2.0.4!
[09:39] <tyrone> nikin: oh i see
[09:39] <nikin> Tyrone: can you help me with just one other thing?
[09:40] <soundray> zch: you don't happen to have an X server on Windows, or a machine with X to ssh from?
[09:40] <nikin> i want to test it over wan
[09:40] <kitche> matthew_: in /etc/inetd.conf you cna doa  srearch in it and look for swat it should have # infront remove the # in from then you will do http://localhost:<port> for the exact port of a default install
[09:40] <nikin> can you do that for me?
[09:40] <zch> soundray: nope i dont, only this windows box, which currently has no inet connection
[09:40] <toHotWep> is slax ware hard then unbuntu for console commdmans
[09:40] <dsnyders> gottatrieit, I believe Debian stays behind to remain as stable as possible.
[09:40] <kitche> gottatrieit: umm no they won't realse the updates until sid is stable which right now its unstable
[09:40] <soundray> zch: how does bitchx connect then?
[09:41] <cheeseboy> sounray, bac i changed the slot what now?
[09:41] <zch> soundray: i ssh-ed to linux box, and started bitchx from command line, linux box has inet connection, only inet connection sharing isn't working
[09:41] <kitche> toHotWep: with slackware you need to know the commands and it's slackware slax is a live unofficial cd based on slackware
[09:41] <zch> soundray: i can normally ssh to linux box
[09:41] <soundray> cheeseboy: run 'lspci' and put the output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[09:41] <gottatrieit> OK. Can I download the new package for OO then and not have a lot of problems? I'm a newbie to Linux, so I'm not sure which way to go.
[09:42] <nofxx> hey..i'm trying to install 6.10, but when I click the icon install it freezes my pc... its possible to install without lauching ubuntu?
[09:42] <toHotWep> thank you  ZCh
[09:42] <matthew_> kitche: it does not have a # in front of it, but when I go to localhost: 910 it doesn't do anything
[09:42] <soundray> gottatrieit: what ubuntu version are you on?
[09:42] <zch> soundray: problem is i couldnt complete step-by step configuration  from the guide since i got "failed to create listening socket: address already in use" when i tried to restart dnsmasq
[09:43] <matthew_> kitche: what port should it be?
[09:43] <dsnyders> gottatrieit, if you're running debian, you should be aware that you're in an ubuntu chat.  Ubuntu has no problem with OO 2
[09:43] <gottatrieit> dsnyders & kitche: How do I stop, or repair, the version of OO I have?  Soundray: Dapper.
[09:43] <ali4728> How can I install a pdf plug-in for Firefox.2.0 ?
[09:43] <kitche> matthew_: it should say what port it's using in inetd.conf
[09:43] <r00t_> where to get VLC-media??
[09:43] <kitche> gottatrieit:you can do  a reinstall unless you want the latest version
[09:44] <matthew_> kitche: you mean the number thats under tcp?
[09:44] <soundray> zch: sorry, that's over my head. Check back here occasionally, maybe next time a network guru is around.
[09:44] <kitche> matthew_: yeah
[09:44] <cheeseboy> soundray, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35044/
[09:44] <gottatrieit> I know that, but my OO has started to freeze up on me and I was looking to update it, dsnyders.
[09:44] <zch> soundray: ok, thanks a lot for your help man
[09:44] <dsnyders> gottatrieit, I've only been running ubuntu for a month or two, so I'm still a noob on this sort of thing.
[09:44] <matthew_> kitche: it said that it couldn't connect
[09:44] <matthew_> kitche: do I need to start something?
[09:45] <gottatrieit> kitche: reinstall OpenOffice?
[09:45] <kitche> matthew_: did you do http://localhost:901 or just localhost:901 since usualyl the http:// way works more
[09:46] <soundray> gottatrieit: I found OOo in dapper stable. I think you should backup your $HOME/.openoffice.org2 and reconfigure it as a user.
[09:46] <gottatrieit> dsnyders: Me too! I like to think I'm compute savvy, but I'm really not. lol.
[09:46] <matthew_> kitche: I did it the http://... but it still says it can't connect
[09:46] <soundray> gottatrieit: am I making sense?
[09:47] <kitche> matthew_: hmm ok one more thing to try /etc/hosts.deny bet that's set up to deny all connections
[09:47] <nofearrr> how i setup my pci sound card not the built in one please "its a xfi sound blaster"
[09:47] <gottatrieit> soundray: Sort of. lol How do i reconfigure it?
[09:47] <soundray> cheeseboy: it's still as if your TV card wasn't even there.
[09:47] <zch> soundray: thanks again, going offline to try something else
[09:47] <matthew_> kitche: since I installed swat through synaptic package would that install everything that is needed?
[09:47] <soundray> zch: good luck
[09:47] <zch> thanks
[09:47] <cheeseboy> soundray, i still dont see it

[09:48] <gottatrieit> soundray:I went into the panels where you do all kinds of stuff earlier today (in OO), like the user profile, etc. and all that.
[09:48] <nofxx> no way else to install 6.10 ? only inside gnome ?
[09:48] <soundray> gottatrieit: that directory I'm talking about holds your personal preferences and stuff. If you stop OOo and move that directory away, it will be recreated on the next OOo start.
[09:48] <linuxian> i'm running Ubuntu Breezy Badger and the problem that I'm facing is that the system is not accepting the root password when logged in as normal user both in graphical and command line mode. However in command line mode, if I login as root and enter the root password it gets accepted. please help and advise
[09:49] <soundray> gottatrieit: you may have activated things that don't go down well with your system, perhaps OpenGL stuff or memory options.
[09:49] <matthew_> kitche: how do I know if it is denying all connections?
[09:49] <tonyyarusso> nofxx: Um, what?
[09:49] <matthew_> kitche: sorry, I'm slowing learning!
[09:49] <kitche> matthew_: in /etc/hosts.deny it should say ALL:ALL
[09:49] <nofxx> tonyyarusso , when I click the install icon....running on the cd.. it freezes my pc.....
[09:50] <matthew_> kitche: at the top of the page?
[09:50] <tonyyarusso> nofxx: How much RAM you got?
[09:50] <nofxx> tonyyarusso on that pc 256
[09:50] <kitche> Matthew_: should be in that file someplace
[09:50] <cheeseboy> soundray,....?
[09:50] <gottatrieit> soundray: How? I haven't gotten into those areas, I don't think, cause I wouldn't know too much about what I was doing there.
[09:50] <Godlol> Hey
[09:50] <nofxx> tonyyarusso its a laptop
[09:50] <zspada15> the only thing that i need is something that will zoom in without blurring the image like microsoft's photo viewer
[09:51] <tonyyarusso> nofxx: Hmm, I thought it would work with that, but it would be slow at least.  You might want to consider the alternate cd.
[09:51] <Godlol> How do I remove the command terminal history?
[09:51] <soundray> cheeseboy: I don't know how to even approach this problem. Let's ask the channel:
[09:51] <nofxx> tonyyarusso .. ow crap... another 700mb download ?
[09:51] <tonyyarusso> Godlol: empty ~/.bash_history
[09:51] <tonyyarusso> nofxx: Sadly, yes
[09:51] <protuberance> has anyone experience with hp drivers for proliant servers on ubuntu-64-bit?

[09:51] <php-freak> hey guys how do i download the msfonts package, its saying my os don't support this package?
[09:52] <soundray> Channel, what do you think? cheeseboy has a BT878 PCI TV card, and it doesn't even show with lspci. How to troubleshoot?
[09:52] <matthew_> kitche: do I need to restart something to enforce that?
[09:52] <nofxx> tonyyarusso , i see .... the alternate is installation without graphical mode so?

[09:56] <soundray> OMG_HACKERZ: it's rude to ask a question and then change nicks.
[09:56] <nikin> open the .dat file from the VCD with some kind of mediaplayer
[09:56] <r00t_> ya but i cant play it . i can see mpeg format music video :(
[09:56] <FidO-DidO> i'm trying to register to ubuntu-forums, but it says my email account is already in use, but i've not registred to forums and the request lost account sends me nothing
[09:56] <nikin> most mediaplayers will recognize it
[09:56] <r00t_> nikin,  doesnt works
[09:56] <craigbass1976> isn't there a way to edit the gnome menus somehow?
[09:57] <jrib> craigbass1976: right click on the ubuntu icon and edit menu
[09:57] <soundray> craigbass1976: were my earlier hints useful for you?
[09:57] <FidO-DidO> how do i can contact with someone to solve this?
[09:57] <OMG_HACKERZ> jrib: I was gonna say that :(
[09:57] <r00t_> Totem could not play 'vcd:///media/cdrom0'. nikin
[09:57] <r00t_> There is no input plugin to handle the location of this movie
[09:57] <craigbass1976> I couldn't get the program, but just realized that there was no networking running.
[09:58] <OMG_HACKERZ> r00t_: download automatix2 and install aLL codecs
[09:58] <r00t_> i did
[09:58] <nikin> r00t_: did you try any other mediplayer?
[09:58] <r00t_> OMG_HACKERZ,  i did
[09:58] <nofxx> hehe... i really think someone could explain... but totem is a joke... what kind of file it really does open ?
[09:58] <nikin> like VLC?
[09:58] <strabes> vlc is really good
[09:58] <r00t_> no i didnt try vlc yet
[09:58] <r00t_> installing
[09:58] <nofxx> grab vlc ... i dont know why it isnt the defaul player
[09:58] <guerby> hi, anyone knowing what is the reasonable delay between "updating to edgy-proposed" and appearance of the package in the update manager?
[09:58] <guerby> This is for https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/70986
[09:58] <craigbass1976> I think I'm just going to put him in the admin group, and delete all the menu items that I think will get hi in trouble.  Later, when he's run the box for a while, and I get more used to Ubuntu (I'm from Fedoratown) I'll do it the right way.
[09:58] <OMG_HACKERZ> VLC's OK, most people use it to play pirated DVD's, lol

[09:59] <tek2k> I compiled VLC and I tried to uninstall using "make uninstall" however its still saying version 0.9.0
[09:59] <nofxx> and there is no diference at all at the software level if the dvd is copied or not
[09:59] <tek2k> how do i get rid of it completely
[10:00] <tek2k> so I can do a fresh package install
[10:00] <strabes> tek2k: can you not install it through synaptic?

[10:00] <strabes> nikin: i sometimes have the same goofy problems with totem
[10:00] <Ring> :o
[10:00] <sootz> I've hearrd that it has issues with laptops
[10:00] <strabes> sootz: depends if your hardware is supported
[10:00] <sootz> hmm
[10:00] <r00t_> nikin,  1 how to install the vlc :(
[10:00] <sootz> Well
[10:00] <Ring> someone else thought of Ring Donut as a nick :o
[10:00] <strabes> sootz: if you have a pretty mainstream one then you shouldn't have any problems
[10:00] <sootz> When I boot the live CD
[10:00] <craigbass1976> soundray, I had to go.  I'm in the basement, and we have a newborn, so I'm often forced to go upstairs at top speed.  Sorry though.
[10:00] <Kayiin> How do I figure out what version of X.org I'm using?
[10:00] <sootz> Will it tell me
[10:01] <gop> does ubuntu sell laptops

[10:02] <sootz> for watching AVIs
[10:02] <Donut> gop: He was probably some ubergeek showing his status, lol
[10:02] <matthew_> gop: they sell machines that come with Ubuntu and that are configured for the hardware
[10:02] <strabes> sootz: yes
[10:02] <craigbass1976> soundray, I did that, but what I really wanted was to be able to pop the network gui window up.  Like I said, I'll figure it out later.  Between modem and printer difficulties, I'll be glad to just get this off my bench.
[10:02] <nikin> root: just open a terminal
[10:02] <r00t_> matthew_,  waht is system76 :-O i saw system32 on windows
[10:02] <nikin> and type:
[10:02] <sootz> well, wish me luck, about to boot ubuntu
[10:02] <strabes> sootz: it's easier for us to follow your question if you type it all in one line. I'm not sure if there's a utility that will tell you if your hardware is supported but you can go here to look if it is: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport

[10:04] <sootz> No no no
[10:04] <strabes> gop: ubuntu is just an operating system, they don't manufacture hardware to put it on like apple does

[10:06] <sootz> Now lets hope my hardware is supported >_<
[10:06] <RoC_MM_0w> I don't use Ubuntu, but my question could be applicable to Ubuntu if I choose to use it.  I current have a HD install of KNOPPIX, and my drive died.  I got a new drive (for now, it's a totally diff size and geometry), and moved my files onto it.  All the files copied, and now when I run "grub-install", I never get a working bootloader.  I've even dd'ed my old 446byte grub into the mbr manually, and all I get is a "cha cha cha cha cha"
[10:06] <RoC_MM_0w>  out of the floppy drive, even though it can't be the BIOS booting the floppy, and grub does not have a floppy config.   Could it be my stage1/stge2 that I havwe to delete to get them regerneated?
[10:06] <sootz> I'm checking disk integrety
[10:06] <soundray> sootz: you can install any ubuntu package on xubuntu.
[10:06] <strabes> sootz: did you get the link i sent you? you can check if it is supported
[10:06] <Rprp> Can someone help me please?
[10:07] <klp> how do I change my resolution in ubuntu? it defaulted to too small
[10:07] <r00t_> sootz, yes

[10:08] <sootz> Lol, I was like...
[10:08] <klp> how do I check which driver im loaded on
[10:08] <grout> im in edgy and i have a crt montitor that in windows goes up to 1280x1024 but in edgy it only goes to 1024x768, im using the i815 driver.  Anyone know how to get better resolution?
[10:09] <nikin> r00t_ sorry i was on the phone
[10:09] <klp> grout, same here
[10:09] <nofearrr> how 2 resetup the sound card please
[10:09] <kitche> grout: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and pick the resolution you want to use

[10:10] <RoC_MM_0w> yeah
[10:10] <klp> how do I make sure its loading the nvidia driver?
[10:10] <r00t_> nikin,  its ok dude
[10:10] <RoC_MM_0w> and my device.map is still correct.

[10:10] <grout> they dont have i815 only i810
[10:10] <strabes> klp: didn't you have to change something in your xorg.conf?
[10:11] <matthew_> where is the super user file browser?
[10:11] <astro73> RoC_MM_0w: do you see a splash screen?
[10:11] <Donut> That's like telling some to type <rm rf />
[10:11] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: confusing that it should try to access the floppy.
[10:11] <kitche> grout: it's i810
[10:11] <strabes> matthew_: gksudo nautilus /path/to/dir
[10:11] <nikin> r00t_ so you have to enable the repos.
[10:11] <Jowi> grout, use i810 and if you have problems with resolutions install 915resolution
[10:11] <RoC_MM_0w> Surprisingly no, I don't see any splash screen or anything grub related...it's possible the grub in the mbr is not pointing in the correct place to search my hard drive for it's files....that is why I wonder about this "stage 1" "stage 2" business.. astro73 soundray
[10:11] <Jowi> !915resolution | grout

[10:12] <r00t_> dont know how :(
[10:12] <r00t_> plesae tell me
[10:12] <strabes> matthew_: get what on your desktop?
[10:12] <kitche> !enter|r00t_
[10:12] <ubotu> r00t_: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[10:12] <nikin> are u using ubuntu?
[10:12] <nikin> or Kubuntu?
[10:12] <craigbass1976> found it.
[10:12] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: from what context did you run grub-install?
[10:12] <matthew_> strabes: a link that would open nautilus as root
[10:12] <klp> does ubuntu install the nvidia driver with the distro?
[10:12] <r00t_> Jowi,  i got 945gnt can i use that 915 ?
[10:12] <RoC_MM_0w> soundray, it was chroot /mnt/hda1 grub-install /dev/hda (from a KNOPPIX offline environment)
[10:13] <ubuntu_> elorri
[10:13] <RoC_MM_0w> soundray, the command has worked flawlessly numerous times before.
[10:13] <kitche> klp: no but it's in the restricted repo
[10:13] <nofxx> is there anything I should know about wifi and xubuntu ? i'm thinking about going for it... with my only256 ram laptop
[10:13] <Jowi> r00t_, most likely. I use it with 945GM
[10:13] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: with /boot/grub/ in place in /mnt/hda1 I assume?
[10:13] <r00t_> enter ? kitche  . i didnt do anything :S
[10:13] <r00t_> nikin,  me ?
[10:13] <klp> kitche, how do I get it from there?
[10:13] <RoC_MM_0w> but then again, only on drives where the MBR had merely been overwritten, not on new drives soundray .  Yes on that soundray
[10:13] <nikin> r00t_: yep
[10:13] <strabes> matthew_: you want a 'shortcut' like a launcher? right click on desktop, create launcher, in the command box put "gksudo nautilus /path/to/dir" I think that will work; not sure though. try it
[10:14] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: I know what I would do.
[10:14] <kitche> klp: enable the multiverse repo then sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[10:14] <RoC_MM_0w> What's that?
[10:14] <Dralid> I am runnng two OSes on two hard drives: Ubuntu on SATA1 and WinXP on SATA2. Until now I've been manually unplugging the Linux Drive to boot to windows. How can I configure linux(GRUB?) to ask on startup?
[10:14] <r00t_> Jowi,  cool :D
=== Spec is now known as Spec[lisa] 
[10:14] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: get the new install booted somehow, perhaps with Super Grub Disk or a tool like that. Then run grub-install from there.
[10:14] <RoC_MM_0w> hmm
[10:14] <r00t_> nikin, ubuntu 6.10 edgy
[10:14] <nikin> r00t_ ok
[10:15] <klp> kitche, where do I enable that?
[10:15] <RoC_MM_0w> soundray, is super grub disk more than just a simple linux bootcd with grub?  It would be nice to have something smarter or more helpful.
[10:15] <nikin> r00t_ then start the add remove utility
[10:15] <matthew_> strabes: ok that worked
[10:15] <matthew_> strabes: thanks
[10:15] <kitche> klp: in synaptic is the easiest way
[10:15] <strabes> matthew_: cool np
[10:15] <tonyyarusso> I'm looking for help figuring out whether this is a hardware or software issue - I'm planning to call IBM soon.  https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/71023
[10:16] <swiftfeet9> hello all
[10:16] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: I haven't used it myself, but once you manage to boot grub (any grub, could even be a floppy one), you can do 'find', 'geometry', 'kernel', 'boot' etc from the command line.
[10:16] <nikin> what program does ubuntu use for ADD/Remove?
[10:16] <nikin> i use KDE
[10:16] <r00t_> nikin,  then?
[10:16] <swiftfeet9> I have a sony vaio VGN-B100B and I can't get the sound to work.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
[10:16] <RoC_MM_0w> soundray, this super grub disk looks interesting, I will try it out right away.
[10:17] <kitche> tonyyarusso: it probably has to do with how ubuntu is setup
[10:17] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: hope it helps.
[10:17] <nikin> is there a checkbox saying : unsupported at the upper right corner?
[10:17] <mlehrer> ok how does edgy's Windows NT resizer work
[10:17] <tonyyarusso> kitche: how so?
[10:17] <jrib> tonyyarusso: maybe try a live cd (maybe other distros too) to rule out software
[10:17] <mlehrer> it gave me an hourglass and is just sitting there
[10:17] <nikin> r00t_: last question is for you ... sry
[10:17] <tonyyarusso> jrib: Well, the thing is I'd have to leave it running on each of them for between a couple of days to a couple of weeks before it happens.
[10:17] <Karhuton> My laptop
[10:17] <r00t_> uhh what did you say?
[10:18] <soundray> mlehrer: how big is your NTFS, and how full was it?
[10:18] <nolimitsoya> i just tried to install a jedi knight game under wine, but failed. since then a have a menu entry for jedi knight under wine in my system menu (xfce) that i cant seem to get rid of. not even --purging wine and reinstalling it helped. where are those entries stored?
[10:18] <kitche> tonyyarusso: are you keeping your laptop on all times?
[10:18] <tonyyarusso> kitche: It's a desktop
[10:18] <nikin> r00t_ i asked : is there a checkbox saying: unsupported at the upper right of the window?
[10:18] <RoC_MM_0w> soundray, if I was using Ubuntu, and I moved my system to a new drive, does the ubuntu livecd have a tool to fix my mbr?
[10:18] <Karhuton> 's hard drive keeps powering down. I tried to stop power management with hdparm (-M 254 = acoustics, -B 254 is power management), but it still keeps on doing it
[10:18] <surferdude> Hi, does anyone here know anything about the ubuntu ltsp package, i need some help
[10:18] <tonyyarusso> kitche: Yes it's on all the time; it's a server
[10:18] <sootz> damn, my wireless G card isnt supported..
[10:18] <mlehrer> soundray: 80G, almost empty (brand new machine)
[10:18] <sootz> but
[10:19] <surferdude> my tftp server doesnt seem to respond to anything
[10:19] <sootz> I'ma use a 11mbps card for now
[10:19] <RoC_MM_0w> nolimitsoya, I think look in ~/.wine/
[10:19] <r00t_> man nikin repos is already installed :-W
[10:19] <kitche> tonyyarusso: yeah I see desktop kinda overread that part it's probably a heat issue\
[10:19] <soundray> RoC_MM_0w: yes, and there is a set of instructions to do it (because Windows installation routinely messes up grub)
[10:19] <Yasuo> n8
[10:19] <nolimitsoya> RoC_MM_0w, not even removing that dir in full helped. :)
[10:19] <tonyyarusso> kitche: Heat?  for the clock?
[10:19] <soundray> !grub | RoC_MM_0w
[10:19] <ubotu> RoC_MM_0w: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:19] <nikin> r00t_ its not about installing repos, but enabling them
[10:19] <sootz> anyone have AIM that could help me with a dual boot?
[10:20] <soundray> mlehrer: how long has it been running?
[10:20] <cappiz> i get an "error" when i try to use adduser
[10:20] <cappiz> like : "only 2 accounts allowed" or something
[10:20] <cappiz> what is that?
[10:20] <tonyyarusso> kitche: atm it's at 53 C
[10:20] <nikin> r00t_ if all repos are enabled by you, you should see VLC in the software list
[10:20] <r00t_> nikin,  no. there is nothing such as unsupported
[10:20] <sootz> If anyone could help me with a dual boot, my AIM is "break windows"
[10:20] <Donut> Might wanna know that www.ubuntu.com is a honeypot
[10:20] <soundray> !dualboot | sootz
[10:20] <ubotu> sootz: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[10:21] <kitche> tonyyarusso: I m not talking about the clock I m tlaking baout everything else the clock issue has to do with how ubuntu is setup, you probably want to use a clock syncer so it's running 127.4F degrees
[10:21] <nikin> r00t_ then i go and swich to gnome... sorry for being so slow, i use KDE most times
[10:21] <nikin> 2 minutes and i ame back
[10:21] <DARKGuy> Hey, quick question: What was the Section name I had to add in the xorg.conf file for using a different Server layout? Section "ServerOptions" ? and if so, what was the line?
[10:22] <r00t_> ok nikin :)
[10:22] <mlehrer> soundray: 2 hours
[10:22] <Karhuton> Is it possible to use ACPI to power down hard disk? Does Gnome or some daemon, installed on a laptop, do that automatically? Can I monitor what acpi commands are sent?
[10:22] <mlehrer> soundray: no hourglass or anything
[10:22] <tonyyarusso> kitche: The issue persists both with the usual setup and with an ntp daemon running.
[10:22] <mlehrer> soundray: does /var/log/partman say anything useful?
=== SteveC is now known as sssss
=== sssss is now known as ssssss
[10:22] <tonyyarusso> kitche: What other things about how ubuntu is setup?  I don't know what you mean?
[10:22] <tonyyarusso> jrib: Any other thoughts from you?
[10:23] <soundray> mlehrer: 2 hours after you hit Apply ?
[10:23] <nikin> back
[10:23] <macdo> I've got dual screens set up, but the mouse pointer can only be moved from left to right, not right to left... Any ideas?
[10:23] <nolimitsoya> does anyone know where wine stores its menu entries?
[10:23] <nikin> r00t_: click on advanced button at bottom left
[10:24] <nikin> and type root password when it asks for
[10:24] <soundray> nolimitsoya: wine stores don't usually have menus, restaurants do.
[10:24] <soundray> nolimitsoya: scnr
[10:24] <jrib> tonyyarusso: not really sure what's going on.  Maybe a modification to my previous suggestion would be to install another distro on some free space
[10:24] <r00t_> nikin,  where ? i cant see
[10:24] <kitche> nolimitsoya: think it's in .wine
[10:24] <soundray> nolimitsoya: what's the name of the undesired entry?
[10:24] <Jowi> nolimitsoya, probably here ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/profiles/All Users/Start Men
[10:24] <nikin> r00t_: at bottom left
[10:25] <sootz> Grr
[10:25] <sootz> Ok
[10:25] <Jowi> nolimitsoya, (missing a "u" at the end there)
[10:25] <sootz> How do I get onto my encrpted network with xubuntu
[10:25] <tonyyarusso> jrib: Hmm, I suppose.  Still not looking forward to it though.  In the past people have mentioned the bios battery, before we knew that it would be fine after a reboot.  Any way that could still be a factor?
[10:25] <nolimitsoya> soundray, its starwars stuff, under wine in the applications menu. Jowi, kitche, no that doesnt help me
[10:25] <nikin> r00t_ if it is not there then start synaptic from system menu/administration
[10:25] <r00t_> nikin, there is a bottom called Help
[10:26] <jrib> tonyyarusso: don't know anything about that
[10:26] <soundray> nolimitsoya: try 'sudo updatedb ; locate starwars' or another suitable string
[10:26] <r00t_> nikin, umm on apps>add/remove  right ?
[10:26] <nikin> r00t_ it should be next to help button
[10:26] <php-freak> hey guys how can i get everything to look nice, and small like on windows xp like my icons, and etc. cause on windows it look real nice, and precise
[10:26] <soundray> nolimitsoya: alternatively, try 'find ~ -name \*starwars\*'
[10:26] <nikin> r00t_ : yep
[10:26] <soundray> nolimitsoya: replace 'starwars' with something from the menu entry name.
[10:27] <Herdez> hello im having trouble on a home network can someone help me please?
[10:27] <r00t_> nikin, i cant be run now coz apt-get is runing :)
[10:27] <eilker> i cant find a tutorial on "how to setup a dhcp server" (trying for vmware) , any help pls ?
[10:27] <nofxx> its possible to upgrade 6.06 to 6.10 with the install cd ?
[10:27] <nikin> but i use 6.06 maybe that could be the difference there
[10:27] <ubuntu_> Lucas
[10:27] <tonyyarusso> kitche: What did you mean?
[10:27] <nikin> r00t_ :D:D:D:D oh ok then lets wait till apt-get finishes :D
[10:27] <Donut> php-freak: why did you install ubuntu if you want XP style stuff?
[10:27] <r00t_> nikin, 33 more to be downloaded :)
[10:27] <nikin> r00t_ what are you apt-geting?
[10:27] <Donut> php-freak:Ride with it.
[10:27] <r00t_> nikin,  Get:3 http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy/universe libwxgtk2.6-0 2.6.3.2.1.5 [2725kB] 
[10:27] <cld2> what kernel do I need to install to have SMP support? the linux-generic doesn't seem to see my second core. thanks.
[10:28] <darksmiley> hi peeps =)
[10:28] <sootz> How can I get on my encrypted wireless newtork with xubuntu
[10:28] <darksmiley> can i ask a couple of qs? =)
[10:28] <r00t_> hmm :)
[10:28] <nolimitsoya> soundray, neither works. :) the first command just gives me a frozen console, and the second gives me 'find: paths must precede expression'
[10:28] <justin_> nofxx: No real point in upgrading anyways.. ;D
[10:28] <Donut> darksmiley: Ask away!
[10:28] <malt> can everyone see www.m4lt.com since i changed some router settings?
[10:28] <justin_> 6.06.. 6.10 have no real differences
[10:28] <r00t_> nikin,  dont laff . VLC
[10:28] <nikin> r00t_ ok then :D
[10:28] <soundray> eilker: install dhcp3-server and look at the docs in /usr/share/doc/dhcp3-server
[10:28] <php-freak> donut: Well I like everything else about linux better, its just not as clearn, like the screen.
[10:29] <darksmiley> i was wondering, how do you change your login manager? and also if there's any quick way to get KDE (kubuntu) looking like gnome (ubuntu)?
[10:29] <computermc> malt: yes
[10:29] <justin_> nofxx: By the way.. I think you can update to 6.10 simply by Synaptic
[10:29] <soundray> nolimitsoya: the first one, you have to leave running for a few minutes, and on the second one, the backslashes are of the essence.
[10:29] <nikin> justin_ i see, but i dont have an other box to try edgy :(:(
[10:29] <darksmiley> i don't like the default kubuntu look...
[10:29] <cld2> malt: yup. I see it
[10:29] <r00t_> i know my connection is really really really slow
[10:29] <malt> it saids malts linux server right?
[10:29] <kitche> tonyyarusso: what keeps time is your bios battery for the clock settings but the most point is that everything else is probably a heat issue
[10:29] <eilker> soundray: thank you
[10:29] <nolimitsoya> soundray, they are backslashes :)
[10:29] <nofxx> justin_ .. but it'll be another 700mb
[10:29] <justin_> nikin: Well.. just go to synaptic and update all things that need to be updated and boom, you have edgy
[10:29] <Jowi> nolimitsoya, ~/.wine/user.reg (just added notepad.exe to run by WinMe, checked the file and notepad.exe has an entry, then removed it with winecfg and checked user.reg again and it is gone)
[10:29] <Donut> My school has one PC running Edubuntu that I use frequently
[10:29] <tonyyarusso> kitche: How?  Where are you coming up with this heat idea?
[10:29] <justin_> nofxx: No.. it will simply update the parts.. most things stayed the same.
[10:29] <nikin> r00t_ justin i do allways update
[10:30] <soundray> nolimitsoya: do I look like a DOS man?
[10:30] <justin_> nikin: Well then you probably are already "edgy"
[10:30] <Donut> lol
[10:30] <kitche> tonyyarusso: 53C is 127.4F which is very hot
[10:30] <nofxx> justin_  hahah you did'nt it yourself....more then 500mb i'm sure
[10:30] <justin_> Like I said.. nothing changed except for a few updates and security patches
[10:30] <r00t_> lol @ justin_
[10:30] <nikin> justin: i didnt do distupgrade
[10:31] <Donut> Hey, could anyone point me out to somewhere I can learn to make a distro EASILY?
[10:31] <r00t_> nikin,  i didnt get you
[10:31] <tonyyarusso> kitche: Not really.  Pretty standard for laptops.  A little high for a desktop, but it's down to 46 now anyway.
[10:31] <justin_> Donut: LFS.
[10:31] <nikin> r00t_ about what?
[10:31] <gerardubn> hello! I need some help. I'm trying to build a program, and i get this error when configuring: --> checking for GTK... configure: error: Package requirements (gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10.0  libxml-2.0 >= 2.4.0) were not met.
[10:31] <Jowi> Donut, check out slax
[10:31] <darksmiley> QUESTION :: how can i change my login manager? =S
[10:31] <Donut> Argh, Linux from Scratch
[10:31] <Donut> forgot about that one
[10:31] <tonyyarusso> gerardubn: You probably need the -dev packages
[10:31] <Herdez> is this the place to ask questions?
[10:31] <justin_> Donut: Linux from Scratch, remember... nothing is "easy" but I suppose their LIVE CD.. is as easy as it gets
[10:31] <darksmiley> i don't know... lol
[10:31] <Donut> Herdez: Yep
[10:31] <darksmiley> sorry
[10:31] <tonyyarusso> Herdez: Support ones yes
[10:31] <strabes> darksmiley: what about it
[10:31] <gerardubn> tonnyyarusso: wich are specificly?
[10:31] <r00t_> <nikin> r00t_ justin i do allways update
[10:32] <darksmiley> i want to change from kdm to gdm
[10:32] <justin_> Donut: But anyways.. forget "easy" :P
[10:32] <nolimitsoya> Jowi, as i said, even removing .wine as a whole did not have any effect, and no, i cant find any star wars string in that file. soundray, im not sure what you mean :)
[10:32] <winbond> does anyone have x1950?
[10:32] <tonyyarusso> gerardubn: libxml-2.0-dev, etc. I believe.
[10:32] <stephans> hello everybody!
[10:32] <r00t_> update = install anything
[10:32] <Donut> Hi :D
[10:32] <r00t_> update = install anything again*
[10:32] <strabes> darksmiley: sudo apt-get install gdm && sudo apt-get remove kdm
[10:32] <kitche> nolimitsoya: so you can't remove that menu item though kde's way?
[10:32] <strabes> darksmiley: i dunno if that will work or not
[10:32] <soundray> nolimitsoya: you are trying to remove an entry from an XFCE menu, correct?
[10:32] <tonyyarusso> kitche: Even if it was a bit warm, how is that remotely related to the behavior I'm getting?
[10:33] <Jowi> Donut, with slax you just add modules to the live-cd to make it a part of the distro
[10:33] <justin_> I suppose that the "major" revision of Ubuntu will only come in 7
[10:33] <nolimitsoya> soundray, yes :)
[10:33] <nolimitsoya> kitche?
[10:33] <justin_> I guess the developers said.. "do not break perfection" :P
[10:33] <stephans> Say is there a shed of documentation -- a tool -- a script -- anything ... that would let me Join an active directory domain?
[10:33] <ubitux> hi
[10:33] <Herdez> i have samba installed and can acces my xp machine but from the xp i cant acces the ubuntu one [keeps asking for pasword]  :S
[10:33] <soundray> nolimitsoya: what happens if you right-click on the unwanted entry?
[10:33] <BratdaBalaia> hi, is the someone who could help me with installing compiz on dapper drake?
[10:33] <Donut> ubitux: Hi :D
[10:33] <nikin> r00t_ in apt-get it is to refresh the package lists, and upgrade is to get the newest version of everything after that
[10:33] <stephans> With ubuntu ..
[10:33] <gerardubn> tonnyyaruso: this one does not exists :S
[10:33] <dougsko> is there a standard-ish kind if way to make a header file be noticed while compiling a program? ./configure is saying it cant find a certain header that i DO have
[10:33] <justin_> Herdez: Put in your password...
[10:33] <nolimitsoya> soundray, nothing :)
[10:33] <tonyyarusso> gerardubn: Well, search and just grep out for -dev
[10:34] <soundray> nolimitsoya: what's the name of the unwanted entry?
[10:34] <beikangyao> I'm looking for info on backing up to a sata tape drive, specifically block sizes and other options to set
[10:34] <tonyyarusso> gerardubn: (and learn how to use tab-complete)
[10:34] <kitche> tonyyarusso: beeps usually mean an overheat problem or another failure while a system is running, it depends on how the system is setup if it will beep or shutdown(some systems will shutdown on a heat problem)
[10:34] <ubitux> do you know if it is possible, on Gnome, to edit directly a file on a remote FTP and when you save it, it is reupload
[10:34] <ubitux> ?
[10:34] <justin_> Personally I do not use SAMBA.. I simply set up an FTP server on my windows machine ;D -- a lot quicker.. and gets what I need done.
[10:34] <darksmiley> no, uninstalling kdm doesn't work, too many dependencies
[10:34] <r00t_> nikin,  yea
[10:34] <computermc> how do I mount a windows shared folder on my system?
[10:34] <gerardubn> tonnyarusso: there are many different packages for xml, but anyone with 2.0-dev
[10:34] <tonyyarusso> kitche: It's not beeping randomly.  When it beeps for things it's supposed to beep for, the beep is too long.
[10:34] <jrib> dougsko: usually you can do ./configure --with-foo=location_of_foo  but I've never had to do that.  I would look into why it is doing that
[10:34] <nikin> !distupgrade | r00t_
[10:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about distupgrade - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:34] <Herdez> i have already and keeps asking it just does a loop there.. i did sudo smbpasswd -a username and assign a password but xp just doesnt seem to get it
[10:34] <Donut> Linuxfromscratch.org isn't loadin'...
[10:34] <r00t_> nikin,  i was taking about format then install ubuntu again
[10:35] <Donut> :(
[10:35] <nolimitsoya> soundray, Wine/<lots of things beginning with Star Wars<
[10:35] <nolimitsoya> *>
[10:35] <kitche> tonyyarusso: then it's probably a kernel problem but int he launchpad you didn't say it was for things that it's suppose to beep for
[10:35] <beikangyao> trying to backp 360G to a DLT4 180/360 and it's only writing 2 DVD's before quitting
[10:35] <r00t_> computermc,  you can mount whole drive
[10:35] <BratdaBalaia> hi, is there someone who could help me with installing compiz on dapper drake?
[10:35] <nikin> r00t_ i use this laptop for dayly work and dont want to use a version with no LTS if it is not nescesarry
[10:35] <tonyyarusso> kitche: All I said was the duration changed....
[10:35] <jrib> !xgl | BratdaBalaia
[10:35] <ubotu> BratdaBalaia: Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - Help in #ubuntu-xgl - See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[10:35] <justin_> Donut: I don't think that's the addy ... search google for linux from scratch.. I think their web addy is diff
[10:35] <dougsko> jrib: yeah ive been going through all the configure options, but there doesnt seem to be one for this. im not even sure why its not seeing it, because its in /usr/local/includes
[10:36] <computermc> r00t_: how?
[10:36] <justin_> Donut: Do you know C/C++ ?
[10:36] <soundray> nolimitsoya: okay, copy my next line and paste it into the terminal. Take everything, warts and all
[10:36] <jrib> dougsko: what are you installing and what is it saying you are missing?
[10:36] <BratdaBalaia> ok, thanks jrib
[10:36] <Donut> How do I send RED messages to people?
[10:36] <r00t_> hmm nikin
[10:36] <Herdez> justin_: i have already and keeps asking it just does a loop there.. i did sudo smbpasswd -a username and assign a password but xp just doesnt seem to get it
[10:36] <soundray> find ~ -iname \*star\*
[10:36] <soundray> nolimitsoya: got that?
[10:36] <r00t_> wait a bit computermc
[10:36] <justin_> Donut: If you do not know C/C++.. I would learn that before you try to create a Linux distro.. *if* you decide to make it public..
[10:36] <jrib> Donut: prefix your message with their name.  Your client is what makes them red.  For me they are yellow :)
[10:36] <nolimitsoya> soundray, yes :)
[10:36] <Jowi> Donut, put their name in the sentence
[10:36] <soundray> nolimitsoya: and leave it running for at least three minutes.
[10:36] <compir99> is there a program for *inux that can control bandwdith? (ie NetLimiter but for linux)?
[10:36] <computermc> r00t_: ok
[10:37] <Donut> Jowi like this?
[10:37] <soundray> nolimitsoya: make sure it's a user terminal, not a root one.
[10:37] <kitche> compir99: iptables
[10:37] <Donut> Argh
[10:37] <Jowi> Donut, yep
[10:37] <justin_> I want a program that will emulate a 56k modem.. still haven't found one to do that ..
[10:37] <php-freak> prbaly stupid question, but when reading something what does i.e. mean i never really paid much attnetion to it
[10:37] <dougsko> jrib: gnucash, and its saying that it cant find ltdl.h, and that perhaps libtools-devel wasnt istalled. but that header file is here
[10:37] <Donut> Did it do it?
[10:37] <Jowi> yes

[10:39] <dougsko> jrib: i was thinking that maybe /usr/local/include wasnt being looked in by configure, but i cant figure out how to make sure it looks there

[10:39] <xzk> I just installed ubuntu 6.01 on my laptop and I can't figure out how to get it to automatically upgrade to the newest version...I did it on my desktop pc but I can't remember how - could someone help me out?
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> xzk: Um, there's no such thing as 6.01
[10:40] <php-freak> what does DEB mean?
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> !deb | php-freak
[10:40] <ubotu> php-freak: deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[10:40] <HYB> yeah what is 6.01

[10:40] <xzk> tonyarusso.. lol u know what i mean
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> xzk: 6.06?
[10:40] <soundray> xzk: configure your /etc/apt/sources.list (or copy it from the desktop), then 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
[10:40] <xzk> yes
[10:41] <tonyyarusso> soundray: Not that simple
[10:41] <Donut> Which file shall I downlaod from here: http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/lfs-livecd/
[10:41] <computermc> r00t_: yes
[10:41] <tonyyarusso> !upgrade | xzk
[10:41] <jrib> dougsko: I still don't understand why are you compiling, is this not on ubuntu?
[10:41] <ubotu> xzk: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[10:41] <Jowi> Donut, LSF is good but complex, you have a lot of options and can tailor it to your needs while Slax is pretty easy if you want quick results but has limitations (see http://www.slax.org/modules.php for an overview of what you can include with the distro)
[10:41] <gray> setting up svn, can anyone help?
[10:41] <Jowi> Donut, just so you know that you have options :)

[10:41] <tonyyarusso> xzk: That's one way, but not the only
[10:42] <zention> hi, which package is lsusb and lspci in?
[10:42] <sysrage> php-freak: it's protecting you from yourself!
[10:42] <xzk> i want the easiest way :(
[10:42] <Jowi> php-freak, maybe you have some keybindings that are set to minimize...?
[10:42] <Donut> Jowi, that looks tasty. Just drag 'n' drop the mods u want into the CD.. Bliss!
[10:42] <php-freak> Well it does it when I swtich windows, sometimes
[10:42] <php-freak> how can i fix it?
[10:42] <dougsko> jrib: no its not. but that doesnt really matter, this is more of a general question though
[10:42] <Jowi> Donut, yep. but a bit limiting if you want total control :)

[10:49] <dbe> Answer, Right answer.
[10:49] <r00t_> !automatix | skypa
[10:49] <ubotu> skypa: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[11:02] <Megaqwerty> woro2006_: no, network-manager-gnome is a different app
[11:02] <HymnToLife> !lamp
[11:02] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[11:02] <r00t_> dbe,  i just saw http://messenger.msn.com

[11:04] <dbe> Megaqwerty, If you mean money.
[11:04] <Megaqwerty> okay.
[11:04] <ski_tmpblablaoiw> how would i go about fixing that?
[11:05] <Megaqwerty> dwad: use the check cd for defects option
[11:05] <Megaqwerty> dwad: if it has defects, download the file again (this time from a different server) and burn it to a new disc

[11:07] <php-freak> I can't get that to run
[11:07] <php-freak> i type the command in, and it don't work
[11:07] <php-freak> or am i doing something wrong?
[11:07] <lostsync> php-freak, yes
[11:07] <Megaqwerty> dwad: ur welcome
[11:08] <computermc> Megaqwerty: I can't get that to work
[11:08] <Jowi> php-freak, that is not a command. it is supposed to be in /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:08] <gnuyen> Hey I set my windows keys to meta, and set it so that my movement key is meta, but alt still moves the windows
[11:08] <lostsync> php-freak, in terminal type: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and paste the deb http://etc.com dapper universe bit into the file opened in nano
[11:08] <Megaqwerty> computermc: what is your error?
[11:08] <gnuyen> and meta does not
[11:08] <dbe> php-freak, You use PHP right? PHP is free software so you dont do anything wrong =).
[11:08] <gnuyen> is this a bug?

[11:09] <mdious> morning everyone :)
[11:09] <computermc> Megaqwerty: SONY is the name of the computer that is sharing the file
[11:09] <lostsync> yeah
[11:09] <lostsync> you'll need to escape the '
[11:09] <delphi> hi, i just had a segment fault when I tried to ping any domain, but it worked fine when i just pinged an ip address, but it went away on a re-boot, any ideas?
[11:09] <php-freak> whats nano mean?
[11:09] <Agrajag> computermc: change ' to \'
[11:09] <php-freak> I know su is super user, root access
[11:09] <lostsync> nano is a text editor for the console
[11:09] <_garry> Hi, all. I've been using Suse 10.0 and Mandrake before that, and I've just installed Kubuntu, my first Debian-based distro. I was surprised to notice that it boots to runlevel 2. Is this standard for Debian, or just for Ubuntu? Or is there a problem I don't know about, and I really should be in runlevel 5?
[11:09] <dbe> php-freak, nano = editor.
[11:10] <php-freak> okay
[11:10] <computermc> Agrajag: change what to \
[11:10] <Megaqwerty> computermc: ok...gimme a second.
[11:10] <computermc> ok
[11:10] <mdious> delphi>the only thing I can think of is you are using windows and not linux...i come to that conclusion on the rebooting fixing without you changing anything
[11:10] <dbe> php-freak, Emacs is more sophisticated.
[11:10] <mdious> :P
[11:10] <Agrajag> computermc: ' to \'. there is a ' in your share name. that has to be escaped.
[11:10] <dbe> php-freak, Both are dist. by FSF.
[11:10] <Agrajag> so instead of //SONY/Matthew'sBackUp you'd have //SONY/Matthew\'sBackUp
[11:10] <jughead> i Have the mozilla flashplugin-nonfree installed, but YouTube videos are not working... how can I upgrade to flash 9 beta 2?

[11:10] <lostsync> er
[11:11] <delphi> mdious: well, i didn't want to re-boot, but was interested to see if it would fix it. now I am worried because it did :(
[11:11] <dbe> jughead, Install GNASH.
[11:11] <jughead> do I need to uninstall the current
[11:11] <lostsync> darn enter key always getting in my way
[11:11] <lostsync> :x
[11:11] <computermc> Agrajag: Ok I changed it but still doesn't work
[11:11] <jrib> _garry: runlevel 2,3,4,5 are all the same (or something like that).  You are ok, that is the correct behavior
[11:11] <php-freak> I see text editor, so I just add the following lines, and these are not commands
[11:11] <Megaqwerty> computermc: I have a different way
[11:11] <computermc> ok
[11:11] <dbe> php-freak, Which lines?
[11:11] <lostsync> php-freak, that is correct
[11:11] <_garry> jrib: Thanks. I thought that might be the case when I looked at the services for those runlevels
[11:11] <mdious> delphi>i've never experienced one so I wouldn't know...odd that it happened when you pinged a domain though...anything in any other log files about it?
[11:11] <Megaqwerty> computermc: go to Places, then go to Network Servers
[11:11] <computermc> ok
[11:11] <Megaqwerty> computermc: click on Windows Network
[11:12] <Megaqwerty> computermc: then choose the domain that SONY is on
[11:12] <delphi> mdious: not sure which log files I would look in?
[11:12] <computermc> ok
[11:12] <Megaqwerty> computermc: then you double-click on SONY and you should be able to see all of the folders you need!

[11:13] <dbe> Agrajag, Absolutley.
[11:13] <computermc> Megaqwerty: I can do that, the reason I wanted to mount this was to have a place to do a backup too
[11:13] <Agrajag> sony's evil but for many reasons beyond that
[11:13] <mdious> delphi>is it possible your memory might be going a bit bad?...I hate hardware :(
[11:13] <Jowi> SMiTTY, "df -h" in a terminal and verify if you're running out of disk space maybe
[11:13] <delphi> tonyyarusso: yep, that was the one. Thanks
[11:13] <computermc> Megaqwerty: is there a program that will backup to a windows shared?
[11:14] <Megaqwerty> computermc: oh, so you need to access it form the terminal?
[11:14] <Jowi> SMiTTY, or are you talking about low sound volume=
[11:14] <Jowi> ?
[11:14] <dbe> Agrajag, I hate non-free softwar more then anything in this world, war is on second place.

[11:15] <Jowi> tuxtoti, are you trying to connect to your own web site from the same machine that the site is running at?
[11:15] <mdious> delphi>i don't know, i just did a google search and this looked like it could be good:  http://www.memtest86.com/
[11:15] <Megaqwerty> computermc: cool
[11:15] <dbe> computermc, Its GNU/Linux, Linux is just the kernel which we are trying to replace with the HURD kernel.
[11:15] <tuxtoti> Jowi: no ..nothing like that..
[11:15] <computermc> dbe: ok I didn't know that
[11:16] <Jowi> tuxtoti, what do you mean by "pinging my domain"?
[11:16] <dbe> Agrajag, I have my policies and you have yours, I accept that.
[11:16] <mdious> tuxtoti>I'd check your dns stuff if your browser can't resolve your domain....
[11:16] <tuxtoti> Jowi: i meant pinging any domain...
[11:16] <delphi> mdious: thanks
[11:16] <SMiTTY> sorry ya low sound volume
[11:17] <SMiTTY> not low disk volume ;)
[11:17] <Jowi> tuxtoti, does it work if you use the ip address?

[11:17] <mdious> delphi>if you scroll down there is downloads/iso's...OOO live cd iso of it would come in handy....
[11:17] <computermc> dbe: ok
[11:17] <Megaqwerty> SMiTTY: actually, ubotu had the answer for me when I had the problem. here:
[11:17] <SMiTTY> other than that I'm lovin ubuntu....everything just flat out worked
[11:17] <Jowi> tuxtoti, then, as mdious said, it is a dns issue
[11:17] <astronouth7303> is there a way change the default media player? totem doesn't do it for me

[11:18] <Staz> Hey, whats the deal with file ownership when you move files to other pcs.
[11:18] <HymnToLife> RoC_MM_0w, not unless you tell it to
[11:18] <dbe> computermc, If you ever say Linux when you mean the OS GNU/Linux rater then GNU/Linux in the rest of the time, then you will be like the rest of the n00bz.
[11:18] <Agrajag> Staz: what do you mean?
[11:18] <Staz> say The owner of a file is "staz" on my pc, if it goes to another computer who owns it then?
[11:18] <tuxtoti> Jowi: but..i dont undestand...if my DNS isnt working then pinging shouldnt work isnt it?
[11:18] <Agrajag> Staz: that depends on what you mean by "goes to another computer"
[11:18] <dbe> php-freak, Dont recommend M$
[11:19] <Agrajag> usually the account that created the file owns it.
[11:19] <SMiTTY> Megaqwerty, thanks...will check...I have ALSA selected....so will check the urls
[11:19] <mdious> Jowi>nothing I say is right I was just trying to sound smart lol...would be nice if it was a simple fix though
[11:19] <Megaqwerty> SMiTTY: cool
[11:19] <vandit2k7> Hi I have a question with mounting drives. Can anybody help?
[11:19] <Staz> goes to another computer --> eg: copied off a samba share, downloaded via ftp etc.
[11:19] <Megaqwerty> computermc: tell me how it goes
[11:19] <edan> cany anyone tell me why i cant run tuxracer?
[11:19] <Jowi> tuxtoti, dns is translating ip addresses. if the ip work, but the name doesn't, then the dns is faulty
[11:19] <computermc> ok
[11:19] <php-freak> dbe: whys that?
[11:19] <Agrajag> If you're unpacking a tarball with ownership information, then whatever account has the same UID as the owner of the files in the tarball will own them
[11:19] <SMiTTY> brb
[11:19] <astronouth7303> vandit2k7: just ask, don't ask to ask
[11:19] <_garry> Staz:  If your UID is 1001, then the user with UID 1001 owns the file
[11:19] <Megaqwerty> !anybody |vandit2k7

[11:19] <php-freak> dbe: I installed the packages, but how do i download the fonts now
[11:19] <Jowi> mdious, you were right at least :)
[11:19] <RoC_MM_0w> staz, it goes on userids.  If you are user 502 on your system, and it is transferred directly or over a linux formatted medium, then user 502 will own it when it gets there.
[11:19] <HymnToLife> because it's called planetpenguin-racer now :p
[11:19] <eighty> errr... installing ubuntu linux from cd and it can't detect disks... what are my options?
[11:20] <Donut> banananananananana!
[11:20] <tuxtoti> Jowi: resolv.conf has two entries..which is my DNS entries....
[11:20] <_garry> Staz: the same goes for GID (group ID)
[11:20] <dbe> php-freak, If you dont want to contribute to non-free software.
[11:20] <edan> can anyone tell me why i cant run tuxracer?
[11:20] <Jowi> tuxtoti, both of them are
[11:20] <mdious> Jowi>I guess everyone is entitled to at least one 'win' lol
[11:20] <Staz> thanks, so you dont actually see the name just the UID/GID?
[11:20] <php-freak> well yea
[11:20] <php-freak> how do i download it
[11:20] <php-freak> the fonts
[11:20] <Jowi> tuxtoti, are they pointing to an address outside your network?
[11:20] <vandit2k7> Ok my new drive doesn't show up as an icon on the desktop I put this drive in after I installed ubuntu but the rest drives show up...what do I do?
[11:20] <tuxtoti> Jowi: i use 4.2.2.2 and 192.168.1.1(my router which runs a DNS server)
[11:21] <Agrajag> dbe: look it's ok man, you can use your normal initials. Just do /nick rms :)
[11:21] <astronouth7303> vandit2k7: harddrive?
[11:21] <RoC_MM_0w> staz, if there is no user with the same UID on that system, then you will see the UID wherever you would see a username.
[11:21] <vandit2k7> yes
[11:21] <vandit2k7> fat32
[11:21] <vandit2k7> I explicity formatted it to be fat32
[11:21] <php-freak> how do i download the msfonts, I installed the multiverse packages?
[11:21] <Jowi> tuxtoti, if 4.2.2.2 does not resolv then 192.168.1.1 will kick in. what address are you trying to reach?
[11:21] <dbe> Agrajag, Hes my mentor.
[11:22] <astronouth7303> vandit2k7: IIRC, install and load the Gnome Partition Editor, unless there's something better to manage fstab?
[11:22] <dbe> Agrajag, And what about it?
[11:22] <_garry> When I installed Kubuntu it set my display to 640x480. I reconfigured it to 1280x960 and all is fine. But while loggin in (Gdm) I get what looks like a virtual 1280x960 screen on a 640x480 display. I can live with it, but does anyone know how to fix this?
[11:22] <php-freak> how do i download the msfonts, I installed the multiverse packages?
[11:22] <Agrajag> dbe: just kidding dude
[11:22] <dbe> Agrajag, I dont use tracking devices if you want to talk, do you use a mobile phone for instance?
[11:22] <tuxtoti> Jowi: "what address are u trying to reach" meaning?...whatever domain i type in my browser it doesnt resolve it...
[11:22] <dbe> Agrajag, I know =).
[11:22] <Jowi> _garry, fix your monitor / video driver set up in xorg.conf ( !resolution )
[11:23] <archangel466> quick question, how do i change the permissions of a mounted hard drive so i can access it without being root?
[11:23] <tuxtoti> Jowi: whereas im able to ping them from a terminal

[11:24] <dbe> Agrajag, =)
[11:24] <Jowi> _garry, that is strange. never had that problem.
[11:24] <archangel466> okay, so i can use chown on it?
[11:24] <vandit2k7> astronouth help
[11:24] <cntb> ty RoC_MM_0w
[11:24] <tuxtoti> Jowi: ..i am able to reach any ip address..if entered as the ip in my browser...
[11:24] <dbe> Agrajag, Agree with me that most of the peeps does not have a clue what free software philosophy is about.
[11:24] <Agrajag> archangel466: that depends on the filesystem. What FS is it?
[11:25] <tuxtoti> Jowi: ..im sorry if im not able to get ur qn properly..
[11:25] <archangel466> Agrajag, ntfs, it's a windows install
[11:25] <Kim^J> Hey there. My bud have this webcam: Creative Live! Vista IM. Do anyone of you know a way to get it to work=
[11:25] <Donut> Why the hell am I downloading Tux Paint?
[11:25] <Agrajag> archangel466: then no, you can't. Set a umask on it in your fstab.
[11:25] <_garry> Jowi: I'd prefer using Kdm anyway. It's installed, but I haven't found where to make it the default, being used to non-Debian distros. I doubt that it will fix the res problem, anyway
[11:25] <linuxuser1> hi
[11:25] <dbe> archangel466, you can with the package captain....
[11:25] <Jowi> tuxtoti, yes, you told me. the name you are trying to reach but are not able to are linked to a ip address. what is that ip address?
[11:25] <RoC_MM_0w> Kim^J, What's Pista?
[11:25] <astronouth7303> vandit2k7: you need to set its mount point, I think
[11:25] <Kim^J> RoC_MM_0w: Huh?
[11:26] <Agrajag> archangel466: for example, here's mine: /dev/hda1       /mnt/windows    ntfs    users,ro,umask=0222,nls=utf8,exec 0 0
[11:26] <RoC_MM_0w> I mean Vista.
[11:26] <dbe> Agrajag, Are you swedish?
[11:26] <compir99> anybody know how can i get firefox to print to a pdf?
[11:26] <Agrajag> dbe: nope, american
[11:26] <beikangyao> I'm looking for information on what options to set on my DLT4 Tape Drive to back up .. drive and tapes are 160/320 but it's only writing 2 DVD's worth before quitting
[11:26] <RoC_MM_0w> compir99, did you try googling?
[11:26] <_garry> compir99: Save the page as HTML, open in OpenOffice, save as PDF
[11:26] <tuxtoti> Jowi: 64.233.187.99
[11:26] <dbe> Agrajag, Agra jag means Angry me on swedish.
[11:27] <Agrajag> I did not know that.
[11:27] <dbe> Agrajag, Arga jag means Angry me on swedish.
[11:27] <dbe> sorry
[11:27] <tuxtoti> Jowi: well its the ip address of google.com got from the ping o/p
[11:27] <Agrajag> Agrajag is a very angry chaaracter in the book Life, the Universe, and Everything by Douglas Adams.
[11:27] <compir99> there is a func on suse that saves html to pdf directly. anything like that?
[11:27] <RoC_MM_0w> compir99, probably.
[11:27] <php-freak> what command do I run to get msfonts, after I installed the packages?
[11:27] <mdious> compir99>you can do it with open office
[11:28] <tuxtoti> Jowi: well im still not sure if i got ur qn properly..
[11:28] <mdious> compir99>apologies, I don't think the open office option is what you are after
[11:28] <archangel466> Agrajag, okay, fstab is a configuration file, and i need to change the umask value in it with a text editor?
[11:28] <php-freak> what command do I run to get msfonts, after I installed the packages?
[11:28] <Agrajag> archangel466: oh, you're not using fstab to mount your partition?

[11:29] <archangel466> i'm using sudo mount -t ntfs blah blah blah
[11:29] <archangel466> somebody told me to do that earlier in a different irc channel
[11:29] <compir99> mdious: oo does but there has to be an easier way w/o oo
[11:29] <Agrajag> archangel466: ok, then you can add the umask in the -o section of the mount command
[11:30] <archangel466> what value does it need to be?
[11:30] <Agrajag> as in -o users,ro,umask=0222,nls=utf8
[11:30] <archangel466> okay
[11:30] <kitche> compir99: ther is couple of apps that do what you want think one is firefox extenstion
[11:30] <Jowi> tuxtoti, 64.233.187.99 exist as ns1.google.com alright
[11:30] <Agrajag> 0222 means you're giving read and execute permissions to everyone on the system
[11:30] <Donut> Let us build an altar for Satan!
[11:30] <Donut> I'll get the supplies.
[11:30] <Donut> Mmmm.
[11:30] <Donut> Anyways....
[11:30] <archangel466> sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 -o users,ro,umask=0222,nls=utf8 ?
[11:31] <Agrajag> If that is not what you want you'll need a different value, and you'll need to set the owner
[11:31] <Agrajag> archangel466: that should be fine
[11:31] <tuxtoti> Jowi: so u figured out something?
[11:31] <archangel466> k, i'll try that
[11:31] <Megaqwerty> How do I download all dependencies of a .deb file (even if I already have them installed)?
[11:31] <Kim^J> Anyone got a Creative Live! Vista IM to work on Dapper? A guide would be good.
[11:31] <philip__> hey, my pc doesnt seem to boot the linux kernel, i cant get any linux operating system working, any way i could get around this?
[11:32] <CypherBIOS> Megaqwerty: double-click him :)
[11:32] <Agrajag> archangel466: though you might need to put the -o users,ro,umask=0222,nls=utf8 part before the device and mountpoint, I'm not sure
[11:32] <Jowi> tuxtoti, gnome-nettool is ok :)
[11:32] <kantlivelong> whats on the livedvd? more apps

[11:33] <BratdaBalaia> i tried #compiz but nobody could help me
[11:33] <Jowi> tuxtoti, by what name are you trying to reach it?
[11:33] <lostsync> philip__, what happens when you try?
[11:33] <archangel466> Agrajag, it worked with the -o at the end of the command, i can see my hard drive now. thanks for the help! :D
[11:33] <Skwid_> (off topic) is there a way to save your level in frozen bubble ??? :)
[11:33] <Donut> At last! SLAX has downlaoded!

[11:33] <philip__> lostsync: my pc just reboots right after the kernel boot goes to 100%

[11:33] <php-freak> how do I install the msfonts after downloading the packages?
[11:33] <Agrajag> archangel466: oh good
[11:33] <philip__> lostsync: i've tried live cd and alternate
[11:34] <tuxtoti> Jowi: trying to reach what? gnome-nettool u mean?
[11:34] <Agrajag> php-freak: are they .deb files? use dpkg -i
[11:34] <philip__> lostsync: all linux operating systems do it
[11:34] <lostsync> philip__, so the problem happens when you try installing it, not after an installation when you're trying to boot into your new OS?
[11:34] <php-freak> Agrajag: I don't know, I think so
[11:34] <Jowi> tuxtoti, no, by what domain name are you trying to reach 64.233.187.99 ? for example google.co.uk or something else?
[11:34] <philip__> lostsync: it does it as i try to load linux kernel to install it on cd boot almost
[11:35] <tuxtoti> Jowi: no just www.google.com
[11:35] <Agrajag> php-freak: or you could use do sudo aot-get install msttcorefonts
[11:35] <philip__> lostsync: doesnt get any where close to displaying gnome or KDE
[11:35] <eighty> tryint to install latest ubuntu server 64 bit... it doesn't recognize my western digital hard drive. thought?

[11:35] <lostsync> philip__, what type of computer are you using?
[11:35] <mdious> eighty>is it sata with jmicron controller...?
[11:35] <Agrajag> instead of downloading packages and then wondering how to install them; apt does everything for you
[11:35] <philip__> lostsync: its a HP t741.uk
[11:35] <philip__> lostsync: just updated the bios and still no luck
[11:35] <Agrajag> php-freak: er, that's apt-get install msttcorefonts, my bad
[11:36] <eighty> mdious: how do i tell?
[11:36] <Jowi> tuxtoti, does 4.2.2.2 (vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net) belong to your ISP?
[11:36] <dbe> Agrajag, Fuck M$ =).
[11:36] <Agrajag> dbe: oh they're just fonts
[11:36] <lostsync> philip__, and you've tried not only ubuntu but other distributions as well?
[11:36] <php-freak> Arajag: So i just type apt-get install mstcorefonts?
[11:36] <DBO> dbe, watch your language please
[11:36] <mdious> eighty>um...i guess the easiest way is to check the manual that came with your computer
[11:36] <dbe> Agrajag, They are just a major Corporation.
[11:36] <Skwid_> (off topic) is there a way to save your level in frozen bubble ??? :)
[11:36] <tuxtoti> Jowi: nope it doesnt...
[11:36] <philip__> lostsync: yes, all do it, its something to do with the kernel i've been told
[11:36] <Agrajag> php-freak: sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
[11:36] <Eddos> quick question :P
[11:36] <archangel466> hah, there's all my music. is there a program to convert .wma files to .ogg or .mp3 somewhere? i never could find one.
[11:36] <BratdaBalaia> can somebody help me install compiz on dapper drake?
[11:36] <philip__> lostsync: and HP dont want to hear about it
[11:36] <eighty> mdious: heh, it was custom built without much docs :)
[11:36] <tuxtoti> Jowi: i think its a public nameserver...
[11:37] <dbe> DBO, For what? Is fuck a bad word when it comes to M$, do you know what the real battle is about?
[11:37] <Agrajag> archangel466: are they DRMed?
[11:37] <eighty> i think it is sata.... looking for controller...
[11:37] <Eddos> if i choose to suspend in Ubuntu, and i run Ubuntu from the live-cd, where does it suspend too?
[11:37] <php-freak> okay I think I got it
[11:37] <mdious> eighty>mine was custom built also but you should have got a book about the motherboard with it
[11:37] <Jowi> tuxtoti, so replace that line in resolv.conf with one of your isp and see if it works better. might be a problem with that nameserver
[11:37] <DBO> dbe, last warning, please dont swear in here
[11:37] <eighty> i do... looking

[11:37] <ubotu> dbe: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[11:37] <php-freak> arajag: hopefully this makes my screen look betters :) , I don't like how linux has the icons so big
[11:37] <eighty> mdious: has 64 bit intel xeon processors
[11:37] <archangel466> Agrajag, uh, maybe. :\ I don't think all of it is.
[11:37] <eighty> does that help? looking...
[11:38] <tuxtoti> Jowi: ..hmm will do that
[11:38] <Agrajag> php-freak: uh, linux doesn't have any icons. Are you talking abotu gnome or KDE or something?
[11:38] <archangel466> Agrajag, there's some stuff that is i'm pretty sure
[11:38] <lostsync> dbe, that is the type of attitude that makes people think linux users and opensource advocates are fanatical, raving geeks whom should be avoided at all costs
[11:38] <Answer> Does anybody have working drivers for Logitech Quickcam Pro 5000 ?
[11:38] <mdious> eighty>i'm guessing it is sata....might have to compile 2.6.18 on another machine to add the support for the appropriate controllers...i had a heap of trouble with my new system....

[11:38] <dbe> kitche, lostsync DBO, From now on, watch out for non-free software recommendations.
[11:38] <BratdaBalaia> thanks freebse
[11:38] <eighty> mdious: i'm a bit lost :(
[11:39] <archangel466> Agrajag, i guess i'll run winamp off my windows hard drive with wine and see if that works. is there a way to convert non-drm'd wmas?
[11:39] <eighty> so compile on another machine and then what?
[11:39] <DBO> dbe, there thats fine, but this room is about tech support, off topic jabber to #ubuntu-offtopic =)
[11:39] <borg> how does one know if the fglrx driver is installed?
[11:39] <dbe> lostsync, Linux = kernel not OS, open source is not free software.
[11:39] <dbe> DBO, Fine.
[11:39] <lostsync> dbe, semantics and irrelevant to me.
[11:39] <mdious> eighty>sorry

[11:40] <eighty> mdious: heh, np :) what's the process you used to get it working?
[11:40] <Agrajag> php-freak: that's either gnome if you're using ubuntu, or kde if you're using kubuntu

[11:41] <php-freak> I'm using unbuntu
[11:41] <mdious> eighty>lots of google and forum searching...i was trying with gentoo and someone made a small live cd with a 2.6.18 kernel with support built in for my sata stuff...that or wait until 2.6.19 comes out
[11:42] <mdious> eighty>i was extremely lost at first since I had no experience with anything sata prior....was all a bit much to start off with but eventually got my head around it...sort of :P
[11:42] <borg> how do i find out my video card driver info?
[11:42] <eighty> mdious: so it's working for you now?
[11:42] <graft> borg: lspci -v -v
[11:42] <mdious> i'm going to head off, all the best eighty i hope you get your problem sorted out.
[11:42] <eighty> is it because of sata that makes it hard?
[11:42] <eighty> mdious: thanks :)
[11:42] <mdious> eighty>haven't had enough time away from work to try the small cd lol....so i don't know...right now it is just a firewall with an ide drive in it
[11:42] <lostsync> philip__, http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=2472802#post2472802 < tried this?

[11:43] <tedb_> hi. has anyone here used ekiga succesfully? it looks very polished, but i can't establish a call...
[11:43] <php-freak> working*
[11:43] <barktpolar> 1. Does it make Downloading Ubuntu ISOs faster and 2. Is it legal?
[11:43] <philip__> lostsync: i'll try that thanks, one second
=== tedb_ is now known as mdeboer
[11:44] <php-freak> Agrajag, : Now ain't there a way i can make my windows look more like windows xp? like my desktop, and fonts, and all layouts, like my browser, and etc?
[11:44] <php-freak> A package for that?
[11:44] <kitche> barktpolar: it makes downloading stuff faster and slower depends but it's legal/illegal depends where you live since it's still p2p but a lot of things that you can use bittorrent for is legal like downloading a linux iso
[11:44] <barktpolar> Yeah, cause I can't download illegal stuff at school
[11:45] <Donut> barktpolar: use www.g2p.org
[11:45] <freebse> php-freak: well you can make it look that way, but what for
[11:45] <St3althy> whats a good control panel thats free to install on ubuntu
[11:45] <Agrajag> php-freak: no clue, I like gnome to look like gnome.
[11:45] <lostsync> php-freak, i don't think there is a package for that but you can customize your desktop using themes/icons/etc from www.gnome-look.org and change your panel layout to your liking
[11:45] <St3althy> like for setiing up websites
[11:45] <php-freak> okay, do i have to restart after these fonts installed?
[11:45] <jenda> There is a quiz in #ubuntu-trivia starting in a few minutes! The lucky winner will be getting a free Ubuntu Poster!!!
[11:45] <php-freak> Cause I don't see them in my fonts app
[11:46] <racarter> can you use ftp command to connect to ftps?
[11:46] <RoC_MM_0w> barktpolar, BitTorrent is a protocol, like AIM or Web.  It is not illegal in any jurisdiction.
[11:46] <freebse> there was a package with a fwm2 sort off desktop that looks like XP... but U can not remember the name...  because it is so useless
[11:46] <Jowi> php-freak, no they should show. you might need to restart the app. it can take a while before the fonts are visible but a restart should not be needed.
[11:46] <freebse> I can't remember :)
[11:46] <barktpolar> OK and will it make downloading Ubuntu Faster, I'm downloading it into my flash drive as a ISO and then taking it home and storing it until I get a CD
[11:47] <RoC_MM_0w> barktpolar, the advantage is the integrity of the download is garunteed, you will always have an exact copy with no corruption when your download finishes.  Speeds are often faster than Web/FTP,, especially during high-traffic times.

I installed gparted to remove one of two NTFS partitions from hde. gparted finished and then moaned about me having to reboot because the other partition was not unmounted. Well, I did just that, then unmounted the first partition, removed it and created a new ext3 partition from most of the remaining space. But here comes the PROBLEM: "Drives" does not show the new ext3 partition. in fact it only shows and unmo
[11:57] <pluma> unted and non-mountable Partition 1 (ntfs, same size as the new ext3) followed by free space followed by another ntfs partition of undetermined size. /dev only has hde and hde1. How do I fix this?
[11:57] <eneried> does anybody how to place again the configure option in screensaver manager in gnome in edgy???
[11:57] <tek2k> Ive checked the sources list and it looks fine

[11:58] <Pelo> eneried, system > prefs > screensaver ?
[11:58] <eneried> i want to remove some horrible screensaver and set options for others, but i can't find a way to do it in edgy... and the web only talk about how bad is that, but not how to solve that
[11:59] <Midge1> can anyone help me?
[11:59] <jrib> eneried: install xscreensaver
[11:59] <neo_> what about prefrences -> screen saver?
[11:59] <Midge1> my installation is really screwing up
[11:59] <Okita> Midge1: What's your problem?
[11:59] <eneried> Pelo, i can only select between screensavers, but not configure them
[11:59] <lostsync> philip__, www.google.com/search?q=linux+hp+t741 found the answer...dont forget the power of search when you start running into post-install problems :)
[11:59] <Midge1> right
[11:59] <Midge1> sghall i pm?
[11:59] <pluma> Another problem is that I can't mount my NTFS partition on hdh1 anymore. It worked yesterday but now mount gives me "already mounted or target busy" even on newly created directories.
[11:59] <Midge1> *shall
[11:59] <cappiz> graft its the same thingy within gnome
[11:59] <Elda> Its in preferences to remove the screen saver
[11:59] <Elda> similar to how you would do it in windows
[11:59] <Okita> Midge1: No, ask it here, no guarantee that I'll know
[11:59] <Midge1> ok
[11:59] <Pelo> eneried,  do a hdd search for the  screen saver name
[11:59] <Midge1> a few linked problems
[12:00] <philip__> lostsync: thats not good, the message "user not known to the underlying authentication module" has apeared on a DOS/BASH like screen
[12:00] <Midge1> 1) synaptic package manager wont run (ask password goes ok, then nothing)
[12:00] <eneried> jrib, i'll install xscreensaver, but how to configure it? how to say gnome to use it instead of gnome-screensaver
[12:00] <eneried> ??
[12:00] <pluma> hdh1 was auto-mounted in a tmp dir when I booted it for the first time. Now it won't mount anywhere anymore.
[12:00] <Midge1> all programs that were not preinstalled say 'no permission'
[12:00] <lostsync> philip__, i have no idea what that means
[12:00] <jrib> eneried: it should replace gnome-screensaver I think
[12:00] <Midge1> and the update install thing wont install updates
[12:00] <philip__> lostsync: google time
[12:00] <Midge1> all were working
[12:00] <Midge1> now not
[12:01] <Pelo> Midge1,  are you using the root password or just a user one
