[12:01] <Infeliz> Arwen: 6.6.6
[12:01] <cmweb> Arwen, nothing happened
[12:01] <Arwen> cmweb, you might not be able to do that because only root can create links in /var
[12:01] <edd_> how do u get to the back-ports?
[12:01] <HuibertGill> nceterval: first try "sudo su", then "export LANG=C" then "LC_ALL=C" then "sudo dpkg-reconfigure localeconf"
[12:01] <crimsun_> nceterval: / HuibertGill: you need to pass the whitespace-delimited locale list to locale-gen
[12:01] <cmweb> arwen, im loged in as root
[12:01] <Arwen> cmweb, it's ln -s <target> <location for symlink>
[12:01] <Arwen> you mighta had the order reversed
[12:02] <crimsun_> nceterval: see GNOME's System> Administration> Language Support, or /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED's left-most column
[12:02] <HuibertGill> Arwen: try "cat /proc/version"
[12:02] <cmweb> root@cmweb:/home/owner# ln -s /var/www /home/Owner/Desktop/WWW
[12:02] <cmweb> ln: creating symbolic link `/home/Owner/Desktop/WWW' to `/var/www': No such file or directory
[12:02] <nceterval> HuibertGill, Wen I do that, I just get: *** stack smashing detected ***: /usr/bin/perl terminated Aborted
[12:03] <edd_> crimsun_: how do i get to back-ports?
[12:03] <crimsun_> !backports |edd_
[12:03] <ubotu> edd_: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[12:03] <chable> anyone can tell me how do i boot kernel 2.6.17-10-generic , default
[12:03] <edd_> ty
[12:03] <nceterval> crimsun_, I see the column you're talking about, but I don't know what to do with it.
[12:03] <ubuntu> i am getting this error when trying to play DVD's in mplayer "failed to open dvd:\\1"
[12:03] <cmweb> arwen, last message for you
[12:03] <crimsun_> nceterval: choose the ones you want, and pass them to locale-gen(8)
[12:03] <HuibertGill> nceterval: hmm, that's strange, it is even stranger that I reme,ber the same output from this afternoon, but it was at work, so I can't check now......
=== ubuntu is now known as joeish
[12:03] <joeish> i am getting this error when trying to play DVD's in mplayer "failed to open dvd:\\1"
[12:04] <Arwen> HuibertGill, that'd be nice, but the version I have is not the one which I want to find out
[12:04] <nceterval> crimsun_, Forgive me for being so ignorant, but I don't know how to pass them.
[12:04] <crimsun_> nceterval: type them in a Terminal
[12:04] <nceterval> Please give an example
[12:04] <Arwen> chable, edit the menu.lst in /boot/grub and adjust the default=whatever to whichever one is the kernel you want
[12:04] <Arwen> cmweb, ?
[12:04] <chable> u mean /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
[12:04] <Arwen> joeish, that's a common error.... have you searched the ubuntu forums?
[12:05] <crimsun_> nceterval: sudo locale-gen da_DK.UTF-8 de_BE.UTF-8
[12:05] <cmweb> arwen,
[12:05] <cmweb> root@cmweb:/home/owner# ln -s /var/www /home/Owner/Desktop/www
[12:05] <cmweb> ln: creating symbolic link `/home/Owner/Desktop/www' to `/var/www': No such file or directory
[12:05] <nceterval> crimsun_, Ah, thank you.  No errors with that, I'll try dpkg again.
[12:05] <Arwen> chable, yes
[12:05] <joeish> Arwen, i have been figured i would try here too
[12:06] <chable> melin ceni hin ln sla i 'eladhach , Arwen
[12:06] <chable> le hannon
[12:06] <nceterval> crimsun_, Fantastic, that did the trick!  HuibertGill, thank you for your help!
[12:06] <gwayne> is there a way to get rid of the ubuntu message i get when I ssh into my box?
[12:06] <Arwen> cmweb, err, do you have a /var/www?
[12:06] <h00t> does anyone know how can i set to "erase" completely instead of moving into trash
[12:06] <Helpmeee> when i try to uninstall linux-restricted-modules i get this error msg: dependency problems prevent removal of linux-restricted-modules
[12:06] <gwayne> i dont see a way to remove it in bash.bashrc
[12:06] <Arwen> cmweb, or are you trying to link /var/www to /home/owner/desktop/www ?
[12:07] <cmweb> arwen, im looking rihgt at it, theirs a phpmyadmin then apache-default
[12:07] <HuibertGill> crimsun_: good one, thanks for the info
[12:07] <Dial_tone> uninstall it using what method?
[12:07] <cmweb> arwen, yesss..
[12:07] <h00t> does anyone know how can i set to "erase" completely instead of moving into trash
[12:07] <Arwen> h00t, it's in nautilus preferences, you can also use the rm command
[12:08] <h00t> Arwen, sorry wrong window
[12:08] <Helpmeee> Dial_tone, using -r
[12:08] <jovans> hallo i am using ubuntu warty and i wont upgrade to edgy is it possible
[12:08] <ThePub> so between my previous install and this new one I have generated an error on a seemingly identical configuration.  When gnome loads up now, just after the startup icons it says that HAL could not be initialized.
[12:08] <Arwen> cmweb, sorry for being stupid, but what folder are you trying to set as target and what dir do you want your symlink to be in?
[12:08] <nceterval> HuibertGill, Hmm, now the perl locale problem is gone, but the "stack smashing" error still keeps me from finishing the Edgy upgrade.
[12:09] <HuibertGill> nceterval: never heard of that during edgy upgrade, I think it's googletime again
[12:09] <Arwen> jovans, you won't upgrade to edgy.... is it possible - well, yes?
[12:10] <nceterval> HuibertGill, The first result is about an Edgy upgrade, form the Ubuntu forums :)
[12:10] <cmweb> Arwen, sorry for my stupidity, i forgot obout that my username is not capitalized
[12:10] <cmweb> I got it
[12:10] <Infeliz> 6876t
[12:10] <Infeliz>  bjkl
[12:10] <Infeliz> ohops
[12:10] <h00t> Arwen, i lost the start menu from the panel on top... i managed to get back the start menu ... do you know how to separate the "preferences" and "administrative" on the panel
[12:10] <nceterval> HuibertGill, Apparently, in that particular case, using aptitude rather than apt get was the solution...   seems odd.
[12:11] <HuibertGill> nceterval: yes, seems odd
[12:11] <cmweb> arwen, but you can tell me thes, what user should the www dir be in
[12:11] <Arwen> cmweb, lol
[12:11] <chable> bnrb reboot
[12:11] <HuibertGill> nceterval: did it work for you?
[12:11] <Arigato> what is the difference between a link and a symbolic link?
[12:11] <Whilsmithe> hey - trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on my desktop but when i hit enter to start the livecd/install at the initial boot screen from the cd it goes to a black screen with a blinking cursor that never does anything, i've tried adding break=bottom to the list of boot options and various other things i found on forums but nothing works
[12:11] <Whilsmithe> anyone know anything that might work?
[12:12] <nceterval> HuibertGill, I'm trying to figure out how to use aptitude, I'll give it a try once I do.
[12:12] <Arwen> h00t, err.... try running the menu editor (alacarte)
[12:12] <Arwen> cmweb, hmm.... no idea - where is it?
[12:12] <HuibertGill> Arigato: first google result for your exact wording: "http://linuxgazette.net/105/pitcher.htmlhttp://linuxgazette.net/105/pitcher.html"
[12:12] <felixjet> can i dissable anacron and atd from services? they are cron's but i dont know if it will f*ck my pc
[12:12] <HuibertGill> nceterval: I never got the hang of aptitude
[12:12] <cmweb>  /var/www
[12:12] <Arwen> Arigato, a symlink redirects a call to a file/folder to another one. A hardlink/link gives a file/folder multiple names and makes it appear to exist multiple times
[12:13] <Arwen> felixjet, yes - system > administration > services >anacron
[12:13] <felixjet> but i can dissable them without no risk?
[12:13] <felixjet> i know how to do, i just want to know if it will be bad
[12:13] <HuibertGill> Arigato: a hardllinks is an inode pointer, a softlink only holds te path/filename info...
[12:13] <Arwen> cmweb, so... what do you mean what user should it be in?
[12:14] <HuibertGill> link "http://linuxgazette.net/105/pitcher.html" (corrected sorry)
[12:14] <cmweb> arwen its in root root it should be in another one
[12:14] <chable> its working
[12:14] <Slart> If a process reports as a Zombie in the system-monitor, is it dead? can I kill it? can it get better? should I kill it?
[12:14] <Arwen> cmweb, I'm lost - what are you trying to do?
[12:14] <chable> rim hennaid Arwen
[12:14] <Arwen> Slart, you can kill it or leave it - zombie is an app that's dead but still shows in the process list
[12:14] <Arwen> chable, ???
[12:15] <nceterval> HuibertGill, It looks like aptitude is getting the same stack smashing error but going through with the dpkg commands anyway...  I don't quite understand, but I won't complain.
[12:15] <n2diy_> Are there any tricks to installing a new kernel with dpkg, I should be aware of?
[12:15] <Slart> Arwen: what makes a process go Zombie?
[12:15] <Cyde> How do I reinstall all of the stuff in /etc/ that comes with a package?  I just removed and installed something, but none of the files in /etc/ got fixed.
[12:15] <cmweb> arwen, scratch it.... Whats the membership command, i need to add my self to www-data
[12:15] <HuibertGill> nceterval: so it like --force in dpkg?
[12:15] <Arwen> cmweb, no idea how to add to group, sorry
[12:15] <Cyde> Arwen: sudo usermod -G www-data -a your_user_name
[12:15] <nceterval> HuibertGill, Oh, maybe, I'm not sure.
[12:15] <eilker> what happens if i delete a script from etc/init.d,   i dont want no-ip script anymore
[12:15] <Cyde> Errrr, cmweb: sudo usermod -G www-data -a your_user_name
[12:16] <Arwen> Slart, basically an error in the app causing it to die
[12:16] <Slart> Arwen: ok. Thanks for your help
[12:16] <porsiip> Hi, I used this guide(http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide) to try to get better screen card settings, but now when I start ubuntu I only get the command line, when I try to write startx it stands fatal error, no screen, is there something I can do to fix this. thanks for all the help I can get on this
[12:16] <chable> pedich Edhellen , Arwen  ?
[12:16] <Arwen> Slart, the easiest way to fix zombied apps is to reboot
[12:16] <Hinj> http://www.irseek.com/files/Freenode/ubuntu/December/10.10.html?hilite=ubuntu
[12:16] <cmweb> sudo usermod -G www-data -a owner ? i did that but still have no access to my www
[12:16] <HuibertGill> eilker: look into "man update-rc.d" or "update-rc.d --help"
[12:16] <s4ltydog> hello folks
[12:17] <n2diy_> Arwen, why not just kill the zombie from Top?
[12:17] <cmweb> cyde, that last one was for you
[12:17] <Arwen> n2diy, sometimes it doesn't work
[12:17] <HuibertGill> eilker: if you just remove the script, you will get a lot of broken symlinks in /etc/rc**.d
[12:17] <Cyde> cmweb: You need to relog.
[12:17] <s4ltydog> Has anyone had an issue where when you install ubuntu, the monitor turns a greenish hue (I've made sure it is not the monitor)
[12:17] <Cyde> cmweb: Changes to groups only take effect once you establish a new shell session.
[12:17] <n2diy_> Arwen, ah, I c
[12:17] <chable> i need to upload some food
[12:17] <Arwen> s4ltydog, yes... this is usually caused by an xorg error
[12:17] <cmweb> cyde, so is their a command to that?
[12:17] <Cyde> How do I reinstall all of the stuff in /etc/ that comes with a package?  I just removed and installed something, but none of the files in /etc/ got fixed.
[12:18] <Slart> Arwen: hmm.. do these zombified processes take memory? smell bad or make any kind of trouble? or can I just leave them if I dont want to reboot right now?
[12:18] <Cyde> cmweb: How are you logged in, on the command line, in a terminal window, SSH, etc.?
[12:18] <Arwen> s4ltydog, oh wait.. greenish hue, sorry, nvm - never seen it before
[12:18] <n2diy_> Cyde, how did you remove and install them?
[12:18] <cmweb> im in gnome on a terminal
[12:18] <Cyde> n2diy_: apt-get remove xxxxx   apt-get install xxxxxxx
[12:18] <Cyde> n2diy_: I messed up and deleted something in /etc/ that the package came with, now reinstalling it isn't bringing that conf file back.
[12:18] <porsiip> Is there an easy way to get my old scrren card settings back? I only get the command line, cause I messed something up, while I tried to change the settings
[12:18] <s4ltydog> I'm thinking it may have something to do with the graphic card drivers?
[12:18] <eilker> HuibertGill: done, thank you, :)  sudo update-rc.d no-ip remove
[12:18] <Arwen> Slart, they do smell bad, as they're zombies. They usually take 0 mem, something that you can verify. They may cause errors, but are usually symptoms of a bigger problem
[12:18] <n2diy_> Cyde, that should have worked.
[12:19] <bruenig> porsiip, what did you change...
[12:19] <Arwen> !acl
[12:19] <noplease> hi
[12:19] <Cyde> n2diy_: It didn't
[12:19] <ubotu> acl: Access control list utilities. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.2.39-1ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 42 kB, installed size 220 kB
[12:19] <n2diy_> test
[12:19] <refus3d> where is the best place to get Emerald themes
[12:19] <Slart> Arwen: ok, sounds like a reboot is in order then
[12:19] <bruenig> !hi | noplease
[12:19] <ubotu> noplease: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[12:19] <s4ltydog> porsiip you can reconfigure xorg.conf
[12:19] <Slart> Arwen: thanks
[12:19] <bruenig> !xconfig | porsiip
[12:19] <ubotu> porsiip: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[12:19] <cmweb> cyde, in gnome on terminal
[12:19] <n2diy_> Cyde, I don't know what to tell you.
[12:19] <Cyde> cmweb: So close the terminal window and open another one.
[12:19] <s4ltydog> refus: Been a while since i've checked, have you tried gnomelook.org?
[12:20] <n2diy_> Are there any tricks to installing a new kernel with dpkg, I should be aware of?
[12:20] <Arwen> does anyone know of a gui tool to change acls?
[12:20] <cmweb> cyde, restart the computer, im in gnome
[12:20] <Arwen> and does using an acl overwrite my octal file permissions? if not, does it take over?
[12:20] <Cyde> cmweb: You don't need to restart the computer, just open another terminal window.
[12:21] <Cyde> cmweb: Ohhh, hrmm. .. you mean you're using Gnome's GUI file browser to look at your file system?
[12:21] <n2diy_> Cyde, run updatedb from a terminal, maybe the stuff is there, but the db doesn't know it
[12:21] <cmweb> cyde, Yes,
[12:21] <Cyde> cmweb: Restart gnome then I guess.
[12:21] <nceterval> HuibertGill, aptitude seemed to be working, but then returned errors while processing every package.
[12:21] <Cyde> cmweb: You don't need to restart your computer though.
[12:21] <cmweb> cyde, i know of no other way to do that
[12:22] <HuibertGill> nceterval: hope they will go away, after the upgrade has completed.
[12:22] <JFG8721> no puedo
[12:22] <jovans> is this the right channel for me?
[12:22] <Cyde> cmweb: Press Alt-F1 to get a real terminal.  (But before you do that, note that Alt-F7 brings you back into X11)
[12:22] <jovans> xubuntu
[12:23] <cmweb> Ok in terminal i do what cyde
[12:23] <jovans> i'd like to download xubuntu feisty is it availible?
[12:23] <nceterval> HuibertGill, It failed to upgrade, though, so it seems that I am stuck again.
[12:23] <HuibertGill> !xubuntu
[12:23] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[12:23] <Cyde> cmweb: Well first of all log out of Gnome ... there should be a GUI way to do that.
[12:23] <eilker> how can i have whole man pages ? not only from console, pdf prefable :)
[12:23] <porsiip> ubotu: what shall I do when I'm reconfiguring the xserver? after writing the command... I'm a noob...
[12:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about what shall I do when I'm reconfiguring the xserver? after writing the command... I'm a noob... - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:23] <cmweb> cyde, its called shutdown :
[12:23] <cmweb> :)*
[12:23] <untony2> hey
[12:23] <HuibertGill> nceterval: have you tried "apt-get dist-upgrade" a few times? (sound funny but it might work)
[12:24] <nceterval> HuibertGill, Several
[12:24] <jovans> are xubuntu feisty herd 1 availib
[12:24] <crimsun_> jovans: no.
[12:24] <jovans> but i have found that iso image
[12:24] <HuibertGill> nceterval: what does apt-get dist-upgrade -f say?
[12:24] <crimsun_> jovans: I highly doubt that.
[12:24] <d00d> Anyone use Koversation, i can't get it to auto nickserv :[
[12:24] <nceterval> HuibertGill, dist-upgrade needs an -f install, -f install fails, aptitude fails...  not sure what to do,
[12:24] <jovans> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily/current/
[12:24] <crimsun_> jovans: that's not Herd 1.
[12:25] <crimsun_> jovans: believe me, I made the final call on that one.
[12:25] <jovans> but feisty or?
[12:25] <HuibertGill> nceterval: all fail with the stack smash error?
[12:25] <crimsun_> jovans: it's a snapshot that was the Herd 1 candidate. It's broken in many situations, though.
[12:25] <nceterval> HuibertGill, Actually, hold on, I have not tried a dist-upgrade -f, just an -f install.  I will do that.
[12:25] <HuibertGill> nceterval: k
[12:26] <nceterval> HuibertGill, It failed with a dependency problem that I think I need to -f install to fix.  I can pastebin, if you'd like.
[12:26] <d00d> Who uses Kovsation here?
[12:27] <nceterval> HuibertGill, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37249/
[12:27] <beerockxs> anyone know what might cause Totem to display videos with false colours (skin shows as blue, e.g.) VLC is working fine.
[12:28] <Krinkle> I can't connect to my hub or get to the internet through ubuntu. Yesterday someone suggested gnome network manager. I can't seem to find that program in any of the program lists and I still can't connect. Pinging google.com says it's an invalid address. Is there something really simple I'm missing?
[12:28] <joeish> i am getting this error when trying to play DVD's in mplayer "failed to open dvd:\\1"
[12:28] <crimsun_> beerockxs: video output method, perhaps?
[12:28] <joeish> i have check the forums and cant find any answers
[12:28] <beerockxs> crimsun_: where would I set that?
[12:28] <ski-worklap> what's with the UUID stuff in /etc/fstab ?
[12:28] <HuibertGill> nceterval: brb
[12:29] <ski-worklap> it's a lot uglier than /dev/hda6 or so, and I can't figure out what real world benefit it has?
[12:29] <HuibertGill> nceterval: have you tried "apt-get --reinstall install xserver-xorg"
[12:29] <crimsun_> ski-worklap: a lot of HDs attached to laptop docks hijack primary indices.
[12:29] <crimsun_> ski-worklap: suddenly booting from /dev/hda1 takes a completely different meaning
[12:30] <nceterval> HuibertGill, No, I will.
[12:30] <cmweb> ljl, your going to kill me
[12:30] <nceterval> HuibertGill, E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[12:30] <crimsun_> ski-worklap: i.e., it's a persistence issue that the uuid issue resolves.
[12:30] <ski-worklap> weird
[12:30] <beerockxs> crimsun_: hmm, it looks like it's behaving wrong when using Xv.
[12:30] <beerockxs> Is there a know problem with fglrx and Xv?
[12:30] <HuibertGill> nceterval: then try "apt-get -f --reinstall install"
[12:30] <cmweb> Whats up with this
[12:30] <cmweb> owner@cmweb:~$ locate php.ini
[12:30] <cmweb> /etc/php4/apache2/php.ini
[12:30] <cmweb> /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini
[12:31] <ski-worklap> so you're talking about full fledged laptop docks, not external (usb/firewire/whatever) hard drives?
[12:31] <HuibertGill> nceterval: just guessing though
[12:31] <age6racer> Hi all, I'm having trouble setting up my wireless driver Linksys WPC45G (Broadcom) I' currently using bcm43xx but my dmesg is full of errors about this  :(
[12:32] <nceterval> HuibertGill, Another error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37250/
[12:32] <age6racer> *WPC54G
[12:32] <nceterval> Very frustrating
[12:32] <cmweb> !wireless
[12:32] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:32] <joeish> i have check the forums and cant find any answers
[12:33] <age6racer> I've been there and done that. i was hoping someone here had set up the same or a similar card
[12:33] <HuibertGill> nceterval: with the unmet dependencis, did apt tell wich packages are missing?
[12:33] <age6racer> I was here yesterday talking to a couple of guys who had. They recommended upgrading to edgy. But nothing has improved so i was coming back for more ideas...
[12:33] <joeish> i am getting this error when trying to play DVD's in mplayer "failed to open dvd:\\1"
[12:34] <Krinkle> I see a lot of faqs on getting wireless networking working. How do you get regular networking working. If I boot up in windows I connect fine. If I boot up in ubuntu it doesn't. I enabled the card what more does it want?

[01:14] <ValMarko> I used easyubuntu
[01:14] <SilentDis> !ask | Fozzie
[01:14] <ubotu> Fozzie: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:14] <BlackHawk> gn8
[01:14] <jrib> [A] ndy80: self explanatory though, right?
[01:14] <Fozzie> Ubotu, i did, earlier
[01:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i did, earlier - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:15] <SilentDis> fozzie:  I just got here.  can't help if I don't know what's going on :)
[01:15] <jrib> Fozzie: don't ask for help, just repeat your question once in a while
[01:15] <[A] ndy80> jrib, not exactly..... because FILOMENA.MP3 is not FILOMENA.mp3 (should be case sensitive...)
[01:15] <n2diy> ValMarko, back up your stuff, last time I tried getting the plugins, I had a hard crash.
[01:15] <Mask> Someone can tell me how where is disk manager. My ubuntu version is 6.10 but it isnt in System > Administrative
[01:15] <joeish> i am trying to add a CD-RW/DVD+-R to fstab and want to know what type/options/etc i should use
[01:15] <mzanfardino> jrib: ok, I've added "multiverse" to all lines with universe.  However, when I run apt-cache search sun-java5-plugin I still get zip
[01:16] <Fozzie> i'm having problems with radeon 900m.  I've followed instructions in faqs to install fglrx and it still isnt' working
[01:16] <jrib> mzanfardino: sudo apt-get update
[01:16] <Fozzie> in troubleshooting, it said to come here and ask for more help
[01:16] <SilentDis> fozzie:  do you get errors when you select that driver from x setup?
[01:16] <jrib> [A] ndy80: and both files don't exist? FILOMENA.MP3 and FILOMENA.mp3?
[01:16] <kudzubane> Fozzie: dedicated video mem, or shared?
[01:17] <[A] ndy80> jrib, only FILOMENA.MP3 exist
[01:17] <Mask> Someone can tell me how where is disk manager. My ubuntu version is 6.10 but it isnt in System > Administrative. Who know pvt-please!!!
[01:17] <mzanfardino> jrib: son of a gun...
[01:17] <n2diy> Are there any tricks to installing a new kernel with dpkg, I should be aware of?
[01:17] <Fozzie> silentdis, sorry, x setup?
[01:17] <kudzubane> !repeat
[01:17] <ubotu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[01:17] <jrib> [A] ndy80: hmm weird
[01:17] <Pelo> blazor are you around ?
[01:17] <mzanfardino> jrib: so, before I go any further, I suppose I should install the sun-java5-plugin.  what about jre1.5.x?
[01:17] <Fozzie> fraid to say i'm pretty new to linux and ubuntu.  I love it so far, i'm just trying to fine tune my laptop now
[01:17] <ValMarko> Where do I get the sources for the manual installation of adobe flash player?
[01:18] <jrib> mzanfardino: it will get installed automatically
[01:18] <TCrafter> !patience
[01:18] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[01:18] <SilentDis> Fozzie:  after you install the new vid driver, it's usually best to go back through your x configuration to make sure it's setup right.  an easy way to do this is to hit a console, and type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:18] <jrib> ValMarko: adobe's site
[01:18] <Capslock118> ok, tried deleting something else on another drive, but it still doesnt show that I lost anything
[01:18] <mzanfardino> jrib: and my references to jre1.4.2?  will they go away?
[01:18] <joeish> i am trying to add a CD-RW/DVD+-R to fstab and want to know what type/options/etc i should use
[01:18] <jrib> mzanfardino: no, you'll have to take care of that
[01:19] <kudzubane> ValMarko: go to the flash page (http://www.flash.com) and click on any of the get flash player buttons
[01:19] <ValMarko> thanks
[01:19] <Capslock118> Im thinking, I moved files from NTFS to ext3. Could that be why it isnt showing that is being deleted, perhaps everything on the drive is just a shortcut?
[01:19] <mzanfardino> jrib: should I just remove the directories that make reference to jre1.4.2?
[01:19] <Fozzie> SilentDis, ok, i'm in there, what do you need to know?  Fglrx is in the list of drivers
[01:19] <jrib> mzanfardino: yeah, I guess.  Do a 'dpkg -S /whatever/file' first.  That will tell you if it belongs to any package
[01:19] <kudzubane> Capslock118:  good chance everything is copied instead
[01:20] <SilentDis> joeish:  mine happens to be on hdc, so ymmv.  a basic one would be /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0 udf,iso9660 user,noauto 0 0
[01:20] <joeish> SilentDis, ok thats what i had....still not working
[01:20] <SilentDis> fozzie:  go through that setup, step by step.  choose the fglrx driver, and take it slow, read each screen :)
[01:21] <jrib> [A] ndy80: what if you  issue the rename command directly on the file?
[01:21] <[A] ndy80> jrib, I've to rename fist to .MP3_ then to .mp3
[01:21] <Fozzie> SilentDis No problem.  Do i need to be exact on things like "Identifier for your Video Card"? or will this just be reference?
[01:21] <mzanfardino> jrib:  I have two suspect directories in /usr/lib/jvm: java-1.4.2-gcj-4.1-4.1.4.2.0 and java-gcj...
[01:21] <[A] ndy80> it's fat32 the usbdisk :(
[01:22] <jrib> mzanfardino: leave those
[01:22] <mzanfardino> ok
[01:22] <mzanfardino> jrib: I'm goin got try this now.  Thank you very much for your help and patients!
[01:22] <jrib> mzanfardino: wait
[01:22] <Capslock118> kudzubane: if that is the case then why am i not seeing these files deleted right away?
[01:22] <mzanfardino> ok
[01:22] <SilentDis> fozzie:  you have to be exact... but having said that, the tool is always there if you fsck things up, and you can go through it again without reprocussion.  (worst that'll happen is you'll end up sitting at a prompt).
[01:22] <mzanfardino> jrib: ok
[01:22] <Mask> Someone can tell me how where is disk manager. My ubuntu version is 6.10 but it isnt in System > Administrative. Who know PVT-plz
[01:22] <ValMarko> Well, I followed all the instructions from Adobe official site. Nothing ! I cant watch videos from youtube. Nevertheless , using mozilla... I can
[01:23] <SilentDis> fozzie:  also, it backs up your old x.conf, so you can just rename the old one into place, should the need arise
[01:23] <jrib> mzanfardino: make sure you get rid of that java link that _doesn't_ point to alternatives.  Then, do this command: sudo update-alternatives --config firefox-javaplugin.so
[01:23] <kudzubane> Capslock118: if NTFS is mounted read-only, nothing gets deleted
=== mcmahonm is now known as mcmahonm[A] 
[01:23] <jrib> ValMarko: where did you install it to
[01:23] <Fozzie> SilentDis Awesome, i'll work through and get back to you soon.  Many many thanks
[01:23] <kudzubane> Capslock118:  (i'm assuming you are moving things from ntfs to ext3)
[01:23] <Blah93> Does anybody know a way to listen to embed mp3s in firefox?
[01:23] <SilentDis> fozzie:  sorry, old convention.  the file name it changes is /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and it makes it's backups right there as well
[01:24] <joeish> i am trying to get my hp dvd writer 300c working but it is saying no medium found for every type of disk i put in it
[01:24] <ValMarko> Good question. a plce where I have permissions. Home.. something
[01:24] <Capslock118> kudzubane: yes i am
[01:24] <jrib> ValMarko: you need to be more specific for me to help you :)
[01:24] <Capslock118> kudzubane: but im referring to deleting files in my ext3 fs
[01:25] <mzanfardino> jrib: like this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37262/
[01:25] <Mask> Someone can tell me how where is disk manager. My ubuntu version is 6.10 but it isnt in System > Administrative. Who know PVT-plz
[01:25] <Blah93> Are there any drivers out there for edgy embed mp3s?
[01:25] <Blah93> in firefox
[01:25] <jrib> mzanfardino: right, you want 3
[01:26] <jrib> mzanfardino: close all firefox and start it again now to test
[01:26] <mzanfardino> jrib: ok, I've removed the symbolic link and run the update-alternative.  I suppose I can try it now?
[01:26] <SilentDis> Blah93:  try this, open synaptic (or whatever package manager you prefer) and type in firefox plugin.  check out the descriptions :)
[01:26] <mzanfardino> jrib: thank you again!
[01:26] <RedKrieg> I'm trying to get my USB mic to work in alsa using http://crache.net/blog/2006/05/06/logitech-usb-desktop-microphone-in-linux/ but I need my .asoundrc file to use spdif .asoundrc here: http://pastebin.redkrieg.com/?page=view&id=1166228337 anyone know what I can do to use the usb for input and spdif for output?
[01:26] <kudzubane> Capslock118: did you check the permissions on the files?
[01:26] <joeish> i am trying to get my hp dvd writer 300c working but it is saying no medium found for every type of disk i put in it
[01:27] <ValMarko> Before that I installed flash using easyubuntu. Is there a conflict ? What should I do to make Firefox recognise the plugin?
[01:27] <SilentDis> i shall be right back.  kde is still a bit jolting to me, and I don't quite know where everything is yet.  gonna hop back to gnome so I can better help people :)
[01:27] <Capslock118> kudzubane: when I mounted the drive, i gave myself permissions
[01:27] <Blah93> SilentDis: Will do
[01:27] <toM|vendettA> Hi, I am trying to install my Quickcam for Notebook pro, the linux-uvc drivers support it, and i dont know how to install them (http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/)
[01:28] <toM|vendettA> can someone hel?
[01:28] <toM|vendettA> help
[01:28] <mohit> hey all
[01:28] <kudzubane> Capslock118: i mean, the actual file permission (it is possible to mount and have rw perm, but file still has read only)
[01:29] <joeish> i am trying to get my hp dvd writer 300c working but it is saying no medium found for every type of disk i put in it
[01:29] <toM|vendettA> Hi, I am trying to install my Quickcam for Notebook pro, the linux-uvc drivers support it, and i dont know how to install them (http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/)
[01:29] <flasher222> how can i make one track/voice in a midi file louder than the others?
[01:29] <flasher222> (using timidity, for example)
[01:30] <Capslock118> kudzubane: it shows owner (me) has rw, while group and others have read only
[01:30] <MystaMax> when i run man samba from the CLI, where is it pulling that data from?
[01:30] <Capslock118> kudzubane: although the group says my name
[01:30] <kudzubane> Capslock118: and does it show files as links to original?
[01:30] <toM|vendettA> Hi, I am trying to install my Quickcam for Notebook pro, the linux-uvc drivers support it, and i dont know how to install from http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/
[01:31] <Capslock118> kudzubane: how do i see that?
[01:31] <ValMarko> I'm using Beryl but I heard that there is also compiz. What's the better one?
[01:31] <Uboon2> "beryl rocks"
[01:32] <SilentDis> valmarko:  the term 'better' has many meanings...  neither is 'better', one is simply better suited to someone else than the other.  (i, personally, prefer beryl) :)
[01:32] <Blah93> SilentDis: it still will not play mp3 objects in firefox
[01:32] <kitche> MystaMax:  /usr/share/man is one spot
[01:32] <ValMarko> I understand. Dependsof what you want
[01:32] <piratepenguin> would Ubuntu run in 5Gb of space?
[01:32] <Blah93> SilentDis: I have the mozilla-plugin-vlc
[01:33] <jamesbrose> piratepenguin, yes it would
[01:33] <Fozzie> SilentDis, I've worked through that.  Was very interesting, i hope that i answered it all correctly.  What should be the next step?
[01:33] <MystaMax> thanks kitche
[01:33] <jamesbrose> piratepenguin, the minimum is really 1 gig
[01:33] <SilentDis> fozzie:  time to restart gdm and cross your fingers lol
[01:33] <piratepenguin> jamesbrose, wow, thanks
[01:33] <kitche> ValMarko: Compiz is done by Novell and is not really complete while beryl used to be compiz-quinnstorm and is more complete
[01:33] <Fozzie> SilentDis hehe, thanks.  I'll hopefully be right back
[01:33] <joeish> i am trying to get my hp dvd writer 300c working but it is saying no medium found for every type of disk i put in it
[01:33] <SilentDis> again, the config file we're working on is in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  there's backups there as well.
[01:33] <jamesbrose> your welcome, now dig this piratepenguin, http://digg.com/design/Photoshop_CS3 :P
[01:34] <Fozzie> Ok
[01:34] <SilentDis> fozzie:  to restart gdm, just hit <ctrl>-<alt>-<backspace> (no need to reboot
[01:34] <mzanfardino> jrib: I'm sorry to keep at this, but I think I'm some kind of idiot.  After everything we've done java still does not work with Firefox 2.0.
[01:34] <PhibreOptix> Hey guys, I'm trying to get my friend to switch to ubuntu, but when he tries to burn the ISO to cd, it tells him that the CD can't fit that much data
[01:34] <kitche> PhibreOptix: you have to finish the cd it will fit but you have to close it after burning
[01:35] <TCrafter> Is he using a 700MB/80min CD?
[01:35] <jrib> mzanfardino: pastebin what 'ls -l /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/' looks like now.  pastebin the page 'about:plugins' displays in firefox too
[01:35] <PhibreOptix> TCrafter: Yes
[01:35] <PhibreOptix> kitche: So, he has to close the open sessions on it?
[01:35] <TCrafter> What program is he using?
[01:35] <PhibreOptix> TCrafter: Nero 7
[01:35] <SilentDis> blah93:  what site are you trying to stream mp3s over?  they might have some sort of weird 'tool' that's necessary to do it.  (this is not something i've done before, just trying to offer suggestions, btw)
[01:35] <Fozzie> SilentDis Didn't know that! handy
[01:36] <SilentDis> fozzie:  nt :)
[01:36] <Fozzie> SilentDis ok, its apparent i still have video, whats the best way to check to see if its working?
[01:36] <TCrafter> Is he using the "Burn Image" from the File menu, rather than dropping the ISO onto the session?
[01:36] <johny5> Hello, I'm trying to install Ubuntu on an older machine that does not support boot from cd-rom, can anyone point me to a good howto for making a boot floppy for this purpose?
[01:36] <kitche> PhibreOptix: yes it should say something like finish when that screen pops up there should be cancel and yes just click ont he one that's on the left side of that window that pops up
[01:36] <mborg> hey i'm a noob and i'm having some totem issues. .wmv, .avi, .mov video formats do not work at all in totem
[01:36] <piratepenguin> jamesbrose, heh, I think the gimp will do for my crop&resize jobs tho XD
[01:36] <Blah93> SilentDis: Whenever I go to nedm.ytmnd.com I don't hear any background music
[01:36] <Capslock118> kudzubane: someone else I was talking to claims that linux doesnt tell you what is deleted, instead it will just write over the information, what doesnt make sense to me is why wouldnt the system tell you how much space the stuff you didnt delete uses up?
[01:36] <Stormx2> Yo. Is linux-kernel-headers the new linux-headers-1.3.3.7?
[01:36] <evilgold> Hey, this is kinda odd, but my wireless card isnt picking up networks even though it seems to be working fine otherwise
[01:36] <PhibreOptix> TCrafter: Yes he is burning it as an image
[01:36] <jamesbrose> piratepenguin, still!

[01:37] <Stormx2> bleh.
[01:37] <Stormx2> I need that deb.
[01:37] <globe> is there a way to tell which video driver I should be using?
[01:37] <jamesbrose> piratepenguin, :O why nott?!
[01:37] <TCrafter> @PhibreOptix - OK, listen to kitche - I don't have Nero on the machine I'm working from :(
[01:37] <piratepenguin> jamesbrose, I spend enough time on forums :(
[01:37] <PhibreOptix> Ok guys, thanks for the help
[01:37] <PhibreOptix> ;)
[01:38] <mzanfardino> jrib: about:plugins: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37266/
[01:38] <jamesbrose> piratepenguin, yeah but if you dig it, you will get a cookie :P
[01:38] <carutsu> hello, here's the story i downloaded ubuntu (it's in spanish), then i downloaded Kubuntu (KDE i mean) but it's in english, is there a way to change it? i haven't found it
[01:38] <mborg> is there a reason why totem shouldn't be able to play wmv, mov, or avi video formats?
[01:38] <Stormx2> Where can I get debs from? Im looking through security.ubuntu.com..... my internet is buggered in ubuntu and I'm in windows.
[01:38] <Fozzie> SilentDis Hmm, i don't think it is.  Xlib: Ext "Xfree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[01:38] <Fozzie> direct rendering: No

[01:38] <kitche> Stormx2: packages.ubuntu.com
[01:38] <l3mr> globe: well, that depends on your graphics card...
[01:38] <Blah93> mborg: You need the codecs to play them
[01:38] <mborg> do you know of a good package?
[01:38] <jrib> mzanfardino: you have two of them.  I don't know if this would cause it to not work, but we should fix that.  I don't think firefox-javaplugin.so belongs.  use dpkg -S and see
[01:38] <Stormx2> Thanks
[01:38] <globe> l3mr its an intel integrated in a gateway mobo
[01:38] <Blah93> mborg: no, I have just recently switched to ubuntu from fc
[01:38] <carutsu> hello?
[01:39] <Blah93> hai
[01:39] <l3mr> globe: well then the default driver ubuntu choses should be fine...
[01:39] <mborg> does anyone know of a decent plugin package for totem?
[01:39] <ago> hi all
[01:39] <SilentDis> fozzie:  apparently not lol
[01:39] <jrib> mzanfardino: after you take care of that, what does this return:  readlink -f $(which firefox)
[01:39] <Fozzie> SilentDis Any ideas?
[01:39] <kudzubane> Capslock118: if you delete something in linux and then ls it, it should be gone
[01:39] <l3mr> globe: do you experience some problems, or why do you ask? :)
[01:39] <SilentDis> fozzie:  you went through, step by step, slowly, the instructions in the wiki?
[01:39] <l3mr> mborg: just use mplayer :)
[01:40] <Fozzie> SilentDis yep, double checked as i went
[01:40] <globe> l3mr: should....isnt.  I had 6.06 on it and it did everything right, reformat and put 6.10 on there and I get xserver failures
[01:40] <Blah93> im curious; is mplayer better than vlc?
[01:40] <joeish> i am trying to get my hp dvd writer 300c working but it is saying no medium found for every type of disk i put in it
[01:40] <mzanfardino> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37267/
[01:40] <l3mr> globe: did you upgrade using update-manager? or apt-get?
[01:40] <SilentDis> fozzie:  because i'm apt to suggest going through them again, just to be sure.  it's a pain, i know, but i had a similar problem first time I was getting into ubuntu... i missed the restricted modules :P
[01:40] <kitche> Blah93: it's more of an opinion whihc one is better
[01:40] <mzanfardino> jrib: does this mean it should be removed/
[01:40] <Capslock118> kudzubane: so would you say it is safe to delete my ntfs tables since everything seems to be transferred over?
[01:40] <kudzubane> Capslock118: whether it is done right as you execute is another matter, but generally it takes a very short amount of time for the actual delete to happen, and certainly, the system knows the files are slated for deletion and will show you proper disk space usage
[01:40] <globe> l3mr: neither.  I reformatted and put in the install cd.
[01:40] <jrib> mzanfardino: dpkg -S  capital and give the full path
[01:41] <Fozzie> SilentDis Missed the Restricted Modules?  Adding them to the sources?
[01:41] <mzanfardino> jrib: dpkg: *firefox-javaplugin.so* not found.
[01:41] <Blah93> kitche: what I meant was does one have more coecs than the other?
[01:41] <SilentDis> fozzie:  installing them properly :P
[01:41] <kudzubane> Capslock118: i would find out why you can't delete the files you transfered first
[01:41] <l3mr> globe: hmm, dunno. i did have some x problems too, at first, but running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg helped...
[01:41] <jrib> mzanfardino: ok, delete it.  That's the one you put back probably
[01:41] <kitche> Blah93: they use the same codec packages
[01:41] <Blah93> kitche: is it just the whole "features" aspecct of it that varies?
[01:42] <globe> l3mr: I've had this problem in the past...and got it working on a gateway laptop but this time i am stuck
[01:42] <l3mr> globe: paste the error message in the pastebing

[01:42] <jrib> mzanfardino: does that tell you anything?
[01:42] <kitche> Blah93: well vlc is more idiot proof I put it that way
[01:42] <mzanfardino> jrib: I'm in the wrong directory?!?
[01:42] <globe> l3mr: um.  how can I do such things w/o x?
[01:42] <Blah93> kitche: then I gotta get mplayer :D
[01:43] <pepik> can anyone recommend LPI vs. CompTIA? I don't actually need the qualification for anything, just considering it as a more structured way to learn Linux for personal use.
[01:43] <jrib> mzanfardino: yeah, you are using your own private installation of firefox.  Edgy has firefox 2.0 so I would just get rid of your private one.  Do this to test things out:  close firefox, then run '/usr/bin/firefox' in a terminal
[01:43] <niu> why i cant use the usplash?
[01:43] <l3mr> globe: hmm ok :) ... what does the error say?

However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[01:44] <cmweb> ljl, you told me before
[01:44] <Capslock118> kudbunzu: im not sure, perhaps I did not catch it at first. I just deleted 7 gb of data from the ext3 drive and it did register in the mount properties: I am curious as to why it doesnt head to the trash can first
[01:44] <cmweb> i have lamp for the third time today
[01:45] <ago> is there any other way to hide files other than .name in linux?
[01:45] <cmweb> the process didnt work
[01:45] <SilentDis> cmweb:  sorry, just noticed your chatter, was simply trying to help :)
[01:45] <kitche> Capslock118: it won't unless you use a gui since the trash can is only used by the desktop environments
[01:45] <cmweb> yep
[01:45] <SilentDis> ago:  why hide a file?  simply restrict access from others to it
[01:45] <Stormx2> how do I get the USB ID of a device?
[01:45] <Capslock118> kitche: ive been in gnome this whole time
[01:45] <Stormx2> like
[01:45] <Stormx2> 6891:a727
[01:45] <ago> SilentDis, half or my partition seems to have vanished
[01:45] <flasher222> how can i convert a midi file to mp3?
[01:45] <daniminas> why ubuntu dapper dont have on the cd a complier, cvs.. all this basic.... i alway need to donwload :-\
[01:46] <SilentDis> ago:  eh?
[01:46] <kitche> Capslock118: but were you deleting files though a terminal?
[01:46] <Capslock118> kitche: no, through nautilus
[01:46] <SilentDis> daniminas:  the DVD does i believe...
[01:46] <ago> SilentDis, cfdisk shows 18GB but df only 9GB (I am talking total space)
[01:46] <jrib> daniminas: it has a compiler, not sure about cvs.  Install build-essential from the cd to get basic development stuff
[01:46] <mzanfardino> jrib: well, it made no difference to run /usr/bin/firefox either as root or not. how the hell did I manage to install my own copy and how do I remove the bloody thing?  Not that it matters... java still isn't working.
[01:46] <pepik> !wireless
[01:46] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[01:47] <kitche> daniminas: the build-esstenial package is on the cd
[01:47] <SilentDis> ago:  odd.  what about fdisk -l
[01:47] <daniminas> ok..... build-essential...
[01:47] <Capslock118> brb
[01:47] <kudzubane> kitche: confused me seeing you here and flipping back and seeing you elsewhere
[01:47] <niu> i'm using the edgy but i my sreen can't init usplash!
[01:47] <rrittenhouse> I installed Ubuntu (edgy) command line only. Now I want to have X start up at boot without any login manager (is this possible?)
[01:47] <mzanfardino> jrib: sorry, bounced myself.
[01:47] <jrib> daniminas: is this computer without internet access?
[01:47] <ago> SilentDis, /dev/sda4             245        2676    19535040   83  Linux
[01:47] <Stormx2> Guys... how do I get a USB ID? Like 6891:a727
[01:48] <jrib> mzanfardino: ok, don't run firefox as root.  pastebin the about:plugins from the new firefox
[01:48] <daniminas> ok, so.. i dont know why apt-get install gcc dont work...
[01:48] <ago> SilentDis, df: /dev/sda4             245        2676    19535040   83  Linux

[01:48] <jrib> !vfat | HoORnet
[01:48] <ubotu> HoORnet: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[01:48] <SilentDis> ago:  aargh, i can't remember block config, so that's not helping :P
[01:48] <Stormx2> Meeh
[01:48] <esaym> hate to ask a question here but i cant seem to get any res higher then 1280x1024
[01:48] <h0ndaracer2> helo everyone
[01:48] <drkm> in list view of a directory in gnome is alternates 2 colours.. is there a way I can change these colours?
[01:48] <jrib> !fixres | esaym

[01:48] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[01:49] <Stormx2> Okay. Can ubotu tell me how to get a USB ID? xD
[01:49] <jrib> drkm: maybe with a theme, not sure
[01:49] <globe> l3mr: hmm...I think that I am getting it.  the error message is about 12 miles long.  thanks for your help though
[01:49] <esaym> i will read that but im sure i have already done it... one sec
[01:49] <h0ndaracer2> how do i delete a file it wont let me move it to the trash section
[01:49] <gnomefreak> drkm: you mean when you use ls?
[01:49] <Capslock118> back
[01:49] <SilentDis> esaym:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, when asked what res are options, mark off what you want.  make sure you choose wisely what higher res you wanna use :)
[01:49] <ago> SilentDis, basically I have 18GB on fdisk and 9 on df, I am concerned someone else has been using my HD, I am trying a way to find out
[01:49] <jrib> h0ndaracer2: what file
[01:49] <rrittenhouse> I installed Ubuntu (edgy) command line only. Now I want to have X start up at boot without any login manager (is this possible?)
[01:50] <esaym> yea i did that
[01:50] <h0ndaracer2> like somtin i downloaded for my wireless car a folder with stuff in it i dont need
[01:50] <h0ndaracer2> it wont let me delete it
[01:50] <SilentDis> ago:  ubuntu or kubuntu?
[01:50] <drkm> gnomefreak: obviously a typo which was meant to be 'it'
[01:50] <esaym> it still uses 1280x1024
[01:50] <mzanfardino> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37269/
[01:50] <esaym> i want 1400x1050
[01:50] <daniminas> jrib: not, but not dsl..
[01:50] <h0ndaracer2> i use ubuntu
[01:50] <ValMarko> Sometimes I see files like , for example: something.sh . What is the meaning of sh attribute?
[01:50] <jrib> esaym: you selected that when you ran dpkg-reconfigure?
[01:50] <ago> SilentDis, ubuntu
[01:50] <kitche> h0ndaracer2: try sudo rm <file> in a console
[01:50] <esaym> yea
[01:50] <esaym> its in the xorg.conf
[01:50] <PhibreOptix> h0ndaracer2: sudo rmdir /path/to/folder
[01:50] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[01:50] <jrib> esaym: did you chec system > preferences > screen resolution now?
[01:50] <SilentDis> valmarko:  usually, .sh means a shell script or the like
[01:50] <esaym> using kubuntu
[01:50] <mzanfardino> jrib: should I just rm -r /opt/firefox?
[01:51] <gnomefreak> drkm: you mean when using ls you see files in 2 colors? or in GUI?
[01:51] <esaym> but the max it shows is 1280x1024
[01:51] <drkm> gnomefreak: in gnome nautilus gui
[01:51] <gnomefreak> drkm: that would be a theme
[01:51] <jrib> mzanfardino: ha, no I think i know what happened.  You have /usr/bin/firefox diverted so it points to that one :)
[01:51] <mzanfardino> jrib: let me check
[01:51] <Capslock118> why wouldnt something I delete in a mounted drive not end up in the trash can?
[01:51] <mrvertigo> blaksmith are you there
[01:52] <drkm> gnomefreak: ahh ok thanks.. I think I've found it
[01:52] <jrib> mzanfardino: close firefox again and run: /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
[01:52] <drkm> jrib: thanks too
[01:52] <gnomefreak> drkm: try a new icon theme (cant remember if icon or main theme)
[01:52] <mzanfardino> jrib: yep!
[01:52] <mzanfardino> jrib: brb
[01:52] <gnomefreak> jrib: you get the black window taken care of?
[01:52] <SilentDis> ago:  i'm not adept enough at command line to check these things yet... have you checked out the disk usage in Applications > Accessories > Disk Usage Analyzer
[01:52] <gnomefreak> SilentDis: dh i think will do that on CLI
[01:53] <mrvertigo> blaksmith?
[01:53] <jrib> gnomefreak: no, I just live with it
[01:53] <gnomefreak> or not
[01:53] <kuto> hi
[01:53] <kuto> what is inputrc
[01:53] <gnomefreak> jrib: oh ok sorry
[01:53] <Capslock118> so i deleted an entire ext3 drive, it was my converted ntfs files
[01:53] <h0ndaracer2> how do i setup sudo rmdir then its  on my desktop lol
[01:53] <ValMarko> Silentdis, is it an extension only used in ubuntu? Do other linux systems also use it?
[01:53] <jrib> gnomefreak: it seems to be a bug in the nvidia driver
[01:53] <gnomefreak> jrib: correct
[01:54] <Capslock118> nothing ended up in the trash, now I am trying to put stuff back on it to test it out, and there is only 9gb left, even though i deleted all my stff in the folder (40gb)
[01:54] <LjL> cmweb: try "sudo a2enmod php5" or failing that "sudo a2enmod php" (i know, bit different from what i told you the other time, but i only learned about this recently)
[01:54] <zylche> Like the bug where I can't run Savage with xchat or firefox open or it'll crash randomly? :P
[01:54] <SilentDis> valmarko:  i've seen it elsewhere.  extensions don't carry quite the same 'meaning' under linux as they do under windows, mind you.
[01:54] <ago> SilentDis, any "high level" tool I have tried reports 9GB in all, but partitioning tools (that look at the device) tell me it should be 18GB.
[01:54] <SilentDis> ago:  did you partition off a seperate partition?
[01:54] <kitche> kuto: it deals with keyboard mapping for specific situations and is used by Readline which is used by bash and most other shells
[01:54] <jrib> h0ndaracer2: what do you mean?
[01:54] <mzanfardino> jrib: well, what do you know? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37270/
[01:54] <cmweb> ljl, This module is already enabled!
[01:55] <gnomefreak> SilentDis: sorry its df
[01:55] <h0ndaracer2> like how do i set the directory to my desktop sry im a noob with this linux stuff
[01:55] <kuto> kitche: does it deal with keyboard mapping with bash terminal?
[01:55] <jrib> mzanfardino: ah, is java working now?
[01:55] <ValMarko> :) I just installed ubuntu. I've been using windows since 1991 :)
[01:55] <kitche> kuto: Readline uses it which deals with bash
[01:55] <cmweb> ljl, would a restart help?
[01:55] <gnomefreak> h0ndaracer2: drag and drop it? or cp
[01:55] <h0ndaracer2> whats cp
[01:55] <gnomefreak> h0ndaracer2: copy
[01:55] <LjL> cmweb: a restart of apache, perhaps. a restart of the system, i doubt it
[01:55] <kuto> kitchie: if so how do i change inputrc to make my delete key to delete characters in bash terminal and not type ~
[01:56] <kuto> do you know kitche
[01:56] <h0ndaracer2> it kepts sayign access denied tho
[01:56] <mzanfardino> jrib: yes!  Bah!  Ok, now, how do I fix this (get rid of "personal" firefox and point firefox to the correct path (/usr/lib/firefox/firefox)
[01:56] <jrib> h0ndaracer2: join #ubuntu-classroom and I'll walk you through it
[01:56] <Fozzie> SilentDis - glxinfo reports "Direct Rendering: Yes" now, and nothing else.  Is this right?
[01:56] <jrib> mzanfardino: dpkg-divert --list '*firefox*'   turn anything up?
[01:56] <esaym> aticonfig --resolution=Screen1,1400x1050 gives:
[01:56] <h0ndaracer2> same server
[01:56] <esaym> Error: Section # expected
[01:56] <esaym> Segmentation fault
[01:56] <jrib> h0ndaracer2: yep
[01:56] <kuto> kitche still there?
[01:56] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[01:57] <cmweb> "apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName" which I'm using local host it shouldn't matter should it?
[01:57] <ubun> i'm surprised nautilus doesn't tell you simple memory things like when you're replacing a file how large the file you are replacing is vs the old one and the trash can to show how much you're about to delete. would be easy to code in
[01:57] <h0ndaracer2> im in it
[01:57] <kitche> kuto: you can do info bash and see since it should be in the info page for bash
[01:57] <mzanfardino> jrib: mark@mark-desktop:~$ dpkg-divert --list '*firefox*'
[01:57] <LjL> cmweb: i think it's just a warning that should really affect things right now
[01:57] <mzanfardino> local diversion of /usr/bin/firefox to /usr/bin/firefox.ubuntu
[01:57] <mzanfardino> local diversion of /usr/bin/mozilla-firefox to /usr/bin/mozilla-firefox.ubuntu
[01:57] <SilentDis> fozzie:  yep :)
[01:58] <aeromix> hi..could you please help me? I'm trying to run firestarter as a firewall..but it every time starts with this error: Failed to start the firewall An unknown error occured Please check your network device settings and make sure your internet connection is active
[01:58] <mzanfardino> jrib: so, would I just relink /usr/bin/firefox to /usr/lib/firefox/firefox?  then rm -r /opt/firefox?
[01:58] <Fozzie> silentdis, Interesting.  I guess i was expecting a fanfare and firework display :)
[01:58] <cmweb> ljl, i made a file called phpinfo.php with the phpinfo script it works but the others dont, maby permissions?
[01:58] <jrib> mzanfardino: follow the removal instructions here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion  (you only need to restore symbolic links, don't worry about profile).  And yes you can delete /opt/firefox
[01:58] <SilentDis> fozzie:  if you wanna check your framerates, you can do a quick glxgears -printfps
[01:58] <aeromix> !firestarter
[01:58] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[01:59] <SilentDis> fozzie:  you should expect numbers in the 1000s
[01:59] <jrib> mzanfardino: direct link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion#head-51054869b8a40ea50859b0163c806e76f882499c

[02:00] <n2diy> Are there any tricks to installing a new kernel with dpkg, I should be aware of?
[02:00] <SilentDis> fozzie:  as for the fireworks display, that would be beryl's job ;)
[02:00] <The_Hunter> How can I fix that?
[02:00] <isede> hive, i am getting this message from adept "dpkg-preconfigure: cannot connect to X server :0.0", what do i do wrong?
[02:00] <LjL> cmweb: what happens anyway when you try to access the pages?
[02:00] <Fozzie> SilentDis, :) yeah, i've heard good things about Beryl.  As for the fps, i'm getting low 800's
[02:00] <cmweb> ljl, it wants me to download the file as a .PHTML same as before
[02:01] <SilentDis> fozzie:  hmm...  it's running though?
[02:01] <LjL> cmweb: ls /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ | grep php
[02:01] <SilentDis> fozzie:  what vid card again?  how much ram on it?
[02:01] <Fozzie> silentdis, yes, lovely tri colored gears

[02:01] <cmweb> ljl,  yes both of php5
[02:01] <Fozzie> silent radeon 900m, not sure on memory, but i'm guessing its not much
[02:02] <SilentDis> ago:  i'd personally take a look with gparted (sudo apt-get install gparted), and see what the drive has.  I'm a rather visual person though ;)
[02:02] <jrib> cmweb: I *think* it won't be setup to use php with .phtml files, see if it works if you rename it to .php.  Or is it already named that?
[02:02] <mzanfardino> jrib: you sir (madam?) are a genius!  Thank you!!!
[02:02] <LjL> cmweb: libapache2-mod-php5 is installed? (apt-cache policy libapache2-mod-php5)

[02:03] <cmweb> ljl, in simple terms yes
[02:03] <kuto> how do i clear my terminal so it clears everything... so that my terminal looks like a new terminal without any previous inputs?
[02:03] <jrib> !anyone | aeromix
[02:03] <SilentDis> DARKGuy:  you can specify a mount point under /etc/fstab, then all users can mount it... if that's what you're referring to
[02:03] <ubotu> aeromix: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:03] <kitche> kuto: reset
[02:03] <LjL> cmweb: what about the phtml thing?
[02:04] <kuto> kitche: thanks

[02:04] <carutsu> hello, here's the story i downloaded ubuntu (it's in spanish), then i downloaded Kubuntu (KDE i mean) but it's in english, is there a way to change it? i haven't found it
[02:04] <LjL> cmweb: no, i mean, what jrib asked
[02:04] <aeromix> Please check your network device settings...etc
[02:04] <drkm> how do I uncompress a .bz2 in terminal?
[02:04] <SilentDis> DARKGuy:  when I want users to be able to mount partitions, i drop a single line into the /etc/fstab, and they can mount/unmount it at will.
[02:04] <aeromix> kitche: any clue?
[02:05] <LjL> Ubotu, tell drkm about bz2 | drkm, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:05] <jrib> drkm: bunzip2 file.bz2
[02:05] <DARKGuy> SilentDis: but this is samba, you know, network filesystems :/
[02:05] <kitche> aeromix: not really the onyl thing I am thinking of is that iptables is not started
[02:05] <cmweb> my bad jrib sorry, yes they are already .php
[02:05] <SilentDis> DARKGuy:  you can do it with samba filesystems, once samba is installed :)
[02:05] <jrib> cmweb: did you restart apache?
[02:05] <drkm> LjL, jrib thanks
[02:05] <aeromix> kitche: how do I start it?

[02:06] <GaiaX11> In windows we have scanip to get ip and mac address from any other computer. Is there a similar program in Ubuntu?
[02:06] <jrib> cmweb: do you have apache installed as well as apache2?
[02:06] <kitche> aeromix: well it should autostart when ubuntu is started
[02:06] <Fozzie> silentdis, according to hp site
[02:06] <aeromix> GaiaX11: nmap x.x.x.0-X
[02:06] <SilentDis> fozzie:  yikes.  then, yes, i'm surpprised you're pulling 800fps out of glxgears lol
[02:06] <cmweb> jrib, no i only did apache 2 *this time*
[02:06] <con-man> anyone?
[02:06] <un_operateur1> gaia, arp maybe
[02:07] <carutsu> anyone who knows?
[02:07] <DARKGuy> SilentDis: as a choice would be good, I'm using fluxbox and LinNeighborhood, I just don't want to run into problems when I try to mount a shared folder in an XP machine with stuff saying "smbmount must be setuid root" and stuff like that
[02:07] <cmweb> jrib, it wouldent matter any way i only loaded a apache 2 command
[02:07] <Fozzie> SilentDis Surprised good? or Surprised bad? :)
[02:07] <aeromix> kitche: the problem is IT DOESN'T ! apparently

[02:08] <DARKGuy> SilentDis: none, I use LinNeighborhood, the samba commandline stuff confuses me to no end
[02:08] <SilentDis> fozzie:  I'm surprized it's pushing 800fps.  I would expect lower.  hate to say it, but ATI is hell on wheels under windows, and just poor under linux :(
[02:08] <LjL> flasher222: probably, it can convert just about anything... but lame (or soundkonverter) is probably easier
[02:08] <jrib> cmweb: clear your browser cache? or try a different one
[02:08] <carutsu> HELLO!?
[02:08] <aeromix> there is too many people:(
[02:08] <SilentDis> !hello | carutsu
[02:08] <ubotu> hello: The classic greeting, and a good example. In component main, is optional. Version 2.1.1-4 (edgy), package size 47 kB, installed size 472 kB
[02:08] <carutsu> thanks Silent
[02:08] <LjL> drkm: KDE, yes
[02:08] <carutsu> hello, here's the story i downloaded ubuntu (it's in spanish), then i downloaded Kubuntu (KDE i mean) but it's in english, is there a way to change it? i haven't found it
[02:08] <GaiaX11> aeromix: Does nmap get mac address also? From any other computer for example a neighbour PC using an external aerial?
[02:08] <con-man> anyone?
[02:08] <Fozzie> SilentDis, Hopefully fglrx will help, right?
[02:09] <Capslock118> I deleted everything under my mounted ext3 folder to see if it would actually delete the stuff, the folders disappeared but the space is still take, This is how I gave myself permissions, does this mean i can read AND write? sudo chown -R marie:marie /storage
[02:09] <Capslock118> sudo chmod -R 755 /storage
[02:09] <LjL> carutsu: there should be K / System / Language Support, not sure it works extremely well though
[02:09] <SilentDis> fozzie:  i think you're at about the limit that linux can push that card (IE, it's all setup right)
[02:09] <drkm> LjL: why KDE over Gnome?
[02:09] <cmweb> jrin, ljl | You guys are geniuses the browser was the problem it works now      Medal of honor to you both
[02:09] <carutsu> let me see, thank you LjL
[02:09] <cmweb> jrib*
[02:09] <carutsu> i prefer KDE
[02:09] <mzanfardino> !samba | carutsu
[02:09] <pr0-j03> drkm: why not :P
[02:09] <ubotu> carutsu: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[02:09] <carutsu> is just so customizable
[02:09] <SilentDis> DARKGuy:  you'll have to get your hands a bit dirty to get that mount point in there, i'm sorry to say.
[02:09] <flasher222> LjL:  thanks!
[02:10] <drkm> pr0-j03: KDE looked a bit clunky to me last time I used it hehe
[02:10] <con-man> QQ
[02:10] <toM|vendettA> hi is there a way to get flash to detect my webcam?

[02:10] <niu> need for help!
[02:10] <LjL> carutsu: otherwise,    sudo apt-get install  language-pack-kde-es-base  kde-i18n-es  language-pack-kde-es
[02:10] <SilentDis> DARKGuy:  one main thing I've learned about linux:  you set it up once through a lengthly setup process, and it works forever PERIOD.  hehe
[02:10] <LjL> cmweb: the browser? how?
[02:10] <carutsu> finally
[02:10] <Fozzie> SilentDis, What was that command you gave me earlier, to run through the video setup?
[02:10] <carutsu> i knew that
[02:10] <SilentDis> fozzie:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:11] <pr0-j03> Ok :D I am using it now.. I think i might go back to gnome myself. It is a bit clunky, and for some reason (this might not be KDE) i cant accsess my NFTS Partiton. APT-GET install ubuntu-desktop, HERE I COME :D
=== poh is now known as pohpoh
[02:11] <mzanfardino> LjL: Can I install KDE if I've already go GNOME installed?
[02:11] <un_operateur1> sure
[02:11] <pr0-j03> I think you can
[02:11] <LjL> drkm: programs i like better, more flexibility (at the expense of horribly crowd preferences windows), and more integration
[02:11] <carutsu> pr0-j03 you should mount it first
[02:11] <Fozzie> SilentDis i'll write it down this time before i log out.  Thanks for your help, it is deeply appreciated!!
[02:11] <LjL> Ubotu, tell mzanfardino about kde | mzanfardino, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:11] <n2diy> SilentDis, nothing works forever, what is your backup strategy?
[02:11] <pr0-j03> I tryed
[02:11] <un_operateur1> KDE and Gnome and XFCE and any other WM can co-exist on the same machine
[02:11] <SilentDis> fozzie:  any time :)
[02:12] <SilentDis> n2diy:  a 1TB raid array on scsi with 10k rpm server hard drives, currently.  rofl
[02:12] <pr0-j03> But it cant find it in /etc/somthingorother
[02:12] <Fozzie> quit
[02:12] <Fozzie> oops
[02:12] <wimpies> are there packages for 2.1 openoffice ?
[02:12] <carutsu> usually no
[02:12] <carutsu> they think are too buggy
[02:12] <wimpies> 2.1 has been released ...
[02:13] <carutsu> the latest develompent isn't there usually
[02:13] <carutsu> i know that
[02:13] <n2diy> SilentDis, roger that, I'm trying to get Mondo working, but the developers haven't returned my email, in 36 hours. I don't have the hardware to match your setup.
[02:13] <wimpies> and I have problems with some bugs
[02:13] <mzanfardino> LjL: thank you, but the link didn't answer the basic question: can I have both GNOME and KDE installed on the same system?
[02:13] <kitche> mzanfardino: yes
[02:13] <un_operateur1> mzanfardino, yes
[02:13] <pr0-j03> Yes, i think you can.
[02:13] <pr0-j03> Lol.
[02:13] <mzanfardino> thank you all!
[02:13] <carutsu> totally YES
[02:13] <LjL> mzanfardino: "to install from Ubuntu"... what does that suggest you? ;)
[02:13] <pr0-j03> k :D
[02:13] <SilentDis> n2diy: only reason I have something like that is because I came upon a true rare find on eBay.  some guy was selling drives, he had no idea what they were, and I swooped :)
[02:13] <carutsu> actually i have booth right now
[02:14] <niu> i can't use the uspalsh in my box.
[02:14] <mzanfardino> bah... it suggests to me that it might replace GNOME... but that's why I asked
[02:14] <SilentDis> n2diy:  i've had it for nearly 4 years now.  it's saved my butt numerous times to have an endless 'backup point' attached to my BSD server :)
[02:14] <LjL> mzanfardino: there are only two downsides that i can think of: 1) your Gnome menus get crowded by KDE applications, and your KDE menus likewise  2) if you later decide to uninstall either Gnome or KDE, it's not necessarily very easy
[02:14] <carutsu> exactly
[02:14] <h0ndaracer2> how do i navigate to the home folder then to the exaples folder
[02:14] <n2diy> SilentDis, ok, good for you. Then what was your backup strategy before that?
[02:14] <LjL> mzanfardino: if you install KDE using aptitude instead of apt-get, the latter most probably becomes easier.
[02:14] <carutsu> actually i still can't uninstall GNOME
[02:15] <pr0-j03> Gah.  i have just started downloading Gnome GUI
[02:15] <SilentDis> n2diy:  it was mostly based upon prayer and sacred incantations.
[02:15] <carutsu> yea but uninstal GNOME is hard
[02:15] <carutsu> couse it was ubuntu first
[02:15] <LjL> carutsu: indeed, you can't. if you uninstall libgnome2.0-0, though, you'll have gotten rid of most of it
[02:15] <Smitty> hello, I'm wondering if anyone can give me a diagnosis to some of my mp3's popping.  Is it the files?
[02:15] <n2diy> SilentDis, I recently discovered that isn't very effective. :/
[02:15] <slicky_> hi.. what is a "kicker"?     "What I do to solve this, is minimize Torrent to kicker, and then to maximize it again"
[02:15] <drkm> LjL: how would I go about installing KDE to give it a go?
[02:15] <SilentDis> n2diy:  no, no it isn't rofl
[02:16] <LjL> Ubotu, tell drkm about kde | drkm, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:16] <kuto> how come /etc/profile in ubuntu is so short?
[02:16] <mzanfardino> LjL: thank you.  I use Kate for javascript editing, and thought that if I installed KDE it might run more cleanly.
[02:16] <SilentDis> n2diy:  it helps to get the BEST witch doctor in the area though ;)
[02:16] <Smitty> mp3's popping, anyone?
[02:16] <carutsu> mm.. i see
[02:16] <pr0-j03> DRKM
[02:16] <LjL> mzanfardino: well, if you run KDE and then (besides Kate) mostly run GNOME programs on it, it'll be just as unclean or worse ;)
[02:16] <biotrox> !drkm
[02:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about drkm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
=== DARKGuy_ is now known as DARKGuy
[02:16] <carutsu> however after that usually is good to have the libreries isnt it?
[02:16] <n2diy> SilentDis, so until I can get Mondo working, what should I be backing up besides /home?
[02:16] <drkm> pr0:?
[02:16] <pr0-j03> terminal: apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[02:16] <DARKGuy> Gah, network messed up
[02:17] <slicky_> ubotu: kicker
[02:17] <kuto> where does ubuntu store the variable PATH?
[02:17] <pr0-j03> drkm: see above :D
[02:17] <ubotu> kicker: desktop panel for KDE. In component main, is optional. Version 4:3.5.5-0ubuntu3.2 (edgy), package size 1953 kB, installed size 5808 kB
[02:17] <mzanfardino> LjL: ok, any suggestions for a new GUI editor for languages like javascript that run will in GNOME?
[02:17] <slicky_> !ubotu: kicker
[02:17] <carutsu> see ya later
[02:17] <LjL> carutsu: i don't have the gnome libraries installed. i see no reason to take up hundreds of megs of disk, when i'm not using gnome applications :)
[02:17] <LjL> blah
[02:17] <SilentDis> n2diy:  if you've got /home backed up, that's a darn good start.  means you'll loose your os, and not much else.  under debian, it doesn't hurt to backup your package archives and some basic settings files too
[02:17] <jrib> kuto: gets set in /etc/environment I believe
[02:17] <LjL> mzanfardino: i use KDE myself, so not really...
[02:17] <pr0-j03> I dont know if it will run in Gnome, but i am using Kate right now, its good.
[02:18] <kuto> cool thanks
[02:18] <un_operateur1> $PATH is usually defined in your shell's rcfile
[02:18] <pr0-j03> im tired.
[02:18] <mzanfardino> LjL: ok. I guess I will have to build a KDE vm and see if I like it any better (have no real preference, just used GNOME and not KDE).
[02:18] <pr0-j03> ^^
[02:19] <pr0-j03> mzanfardino: I think that you can install KDE, and then change the GUI with somthing called Session Manager?
[02:19] <pr0-j03> Im not sure though.
[02:19] <LjL> mzanfardino: actually, if you use aptitude to install it, i think you'll be able to completely remove it and be back to your GNOME desktop as you left it (perhaps making a new user for KDE might be best, if you really are concerned)
[02:19] <n2diy> SilentDis, ok roger the .deb archives, any clue what settings files to backup?
[02:19] <SilentDis> ok, i just herd David Bowie / Bing Crosby sing a duet of "Peace on Earth / Little Drummer Boy"  that was really cool :)
[02:19] <LjL> mzanfardino: don't take my word on it, but i've done this before
[02:19] <LjL> pr0-j03: you just need to click on the Sessions (or Options, in GDM) button in the display manager and select your session
[02:19] <Drako60> http://pastebin.ca/280562  http://pastebin.ca/280571   http://pastebin.ca/280573   <-- would anyone care to look at that and help me out a bit
[02:20] <SilentDis> n2diy:  depends on how much you're willing to restore later.  I'd say the xorg.conf can die, but maybe your /etc/fstab would be good... and in your /home, make sure you grab all .file config info.
[02:20] <mzanfardino> LjL: thanks again
[02:20] <mzanfardino> later
[02:20] <n2diy> SilentDis, David Bowie, and Bing Crosby!? And I'm asking you for advice!!!??? :)
[02:20] <SilentDis> n2diy:  rofl
[02:20] <n2diy> SilentDis, roger on the files.
[02:20] <kuto> jrib: what file does env read?
[02:20] <nothlit> !sbackup | n2diy
[02:20] <ubotu> n2diy: sbackup is a tool to create complete and/or incremental backups (which can be scheduled to be automatic, and can be done over a network). It is available in !Universe
[02:20] <Smitty> how do you diagnose mp3's that click or pop
[02:21] <kuto> when you you export how do you unexport
[02:21] <nothlit> n2diy, but it isn't like mondo from bare metal
[02:21] <kuto> can you unset easily
[02:21] <kuto> pls help
[02:21] <SilentDis> n2diy:  depends, as I said, on what exactly you're willing to restore later, assuming the worst.
[02:21] <nothlit> LjL, apt-get remove autoremove?
[02:21] <LjL> nothlit: actually, it's just "apt-get autoremove"
[02:21] <nothlit> LjL, oh, i just looked at psychocats.net
[02:21] <LjL> nothlit: but i didn't have very exceptional experiences with that - while aptitude always worked nicely
[02:22] <nothlit> LjL, oh it doesn't always work?
[02:22] <SilentDis> n2diy:  I usually keep text files of everything I've configured sitting around (i installed this that and the other thing, they do this that the other, are attached to the package <packagename>, etc) in my /home folder
[02:22] <LjL> nothlit: (specifically, i just installed GNOME to try something the other day, and autoremove didn't remove even half of it)
[02:22] <n2diy> SilentDis, I was using sbackup, and it was a disaster, the restore program doesn't have a progress indicator, so you don't know when it is finished.
[02:22] <nothlit> LjL, wow
[02:23] <LjL> nothlit: apparently not - it probably does some thinking of its own in order to decide which packages you want and which you don't... but i'd rather just have aptitude removing *all* packages that i haven't installed explicitly
[02:23] <ady> yo
[02:23] <LjL> or perhaps it just still has some bugs
[02:23] <n2diy> I just did a bare metal restore, with the install cd, and what I manged to get off sbackup.
[02:23] <SilentDis> n2diy:  when I reinstall, i usually just copy over my .debs, my /home folder files, and then have a lengthly sudo apt-get install line that i've setup.
[02:23] <nothlit> n2diy, its a tar, you can do it manually
[02:24] <LjL> !cloning | SilentDis
[02:24] <ady> is anyone in here using wine on ubuntu
[02:24] <ubotu> SilentDis: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type "dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages", move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type "sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade"
[02:24] <jrib> !anyone | ady
[02:24] <ubotu> ady: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:24] <LjL> !ask | ady
[02:24] <ubotu> ady: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:24] <LjL> @lart jrib
[02:24] <LjL> hey, it's enabled?!
[02:24] <nothlit> LjL, ahh, i like aptitude better anyways
[02:24] <SilentDis> ljl:  oh cool, was wondering how to do that in an easier way.  I've been just copying them around lol
[02:24] <SilentDis> ljl:  thanks :D
[02:24] <jrib> LjL: great... now everyone knows :P
[02:24] <gyaresu> Hey. I've got two laptops now that need to have 'kdm' restarted because it just drops to a terminal. Any ideas?
[02:24] <ady> are you all mostly linux people?
[02:25] <DARKGuy> Hm, I installed Ubuntu using the alternate CD, plain CLI interface installed and installed Xorg, Fluxbox and such. I just installed Kate and Konsole (since it was needed by Kate's terminal window) but then it replaced my Bash terminal in Fluxbox. Is there a way to change the default terminal app somewhere?
[02:25] <SilentDis> LjL: oh god... they didn't enable all of them, did they?
[02:25] <LjL> ady: is that a trick question?
[02:25] <un_operateur1> aptitude has a nasty habit of removing packages that are needed by other 3rd party packages compiled from source, etc
[02:25] <SilentDis> @ferengi
[02:25] <gyaresu> ady: You mean smart?
[02:25] <drkm> if I go ahead and install KDE via apt-get install kubuntu-desktop.. will it switch over from Gnome on my next restart or do I need to edit some for of config?
[02:25] <SilentDis> LjL: that answers that at least lol
[02:25] <drkm> for = sort*
[02:25] <n2diy> SilentDis, what is a tar I can do manually? Now I use Nautilus's archive feature.
[02:26] <SilentDis> n2diy:  you're looking to tar what?
[02:26] <gyaresu> Anyone else having KDM crash on startup?
[02:26] <un_operateur1> drkm, you'll need to chose KDE at logon
[02:26] <DARKGuy> drkm: you'll have to choose your session (to be KDE) when you restart and are back on GDM
[02:26] <Drako60> well obviously no one wants to even tell me they don't have a clue, let alone help. this officially sucks
[02:26] <drkm> ok thanks
[02:26] <nothlit> !X | gyaresu
[02:26] <ubotu> gyaresu: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[02:26] <n2diy> SilentDis, I'm not looking to tar anything, you brought that up.(?)
[02:27] <DARKGuy> Drako60: If you don't ask, don't expect an answer :/ I haven't seen a question by you so...
[02:27] <cmweb> can i just place a command instide a script and have it work?
[02:27] <SilentDis> Drako60: i'm here, just missed your question.  ask again :)
[02:27] <gyaresu> nothlit: Thanks but this is specific and happening on two different laptops now.
[02:27] <nothlit> dkrm, to choose which display/logon manager you want you do sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm (or kdm)
[02:27] <ady> LjL i have recently turned away from M$ window$
[02:27] <cmweb> such as /usr/local/bin/noip2
[02:27] <un_operateur1> cmweb, sure -- as long as the script is run properly
[02:27] <Drako60> http://pastebin.ca/280562  http://pastebin.ca/280571   http://pastebin.ca/280573   <-- would anyone care to look at that and help me out a bit
[02:27] <SilentDis> n2diy:  i didn't lol
[02:27] <nothlit> gyaresu, you want something other than restarting kdm?
[02:27] <Drako60> DARKGuy, i've asked three times so far
[02:27] <ozoneco> is there a sudo level file manager with a GUI?
[02:27] <DARKGuy> Drako60: ah, my bad then oO
[02:27] <LjL> ady: well, this is the support channel for Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a Linux distribution, so yeah, i suppose we mostly do use Linux in here
[02:27] <un_operateur1> sudoing a GUI is bad practise
[02:28] <ady> haha
[02:28] <SilentDis> Drako60:  what's the gist of your problem?  I've got 43 windows up right now, and can't hit the pastebin.
[02:28] <gyaresu> nothlit: I've got no crash logs. It restarts just fine. It just doesn't want to start up from boot.
[02:28] <un_operateur1> s/practise/practice/
[02:28] <LjL> ozoneco: what's wrong with just doing Alt+F2 and typing "gksudo nautilus"?
[02:28] <LjL> well, right, there's a few things wrong with that, but still
[02:28] <ozoneco> LjL: nothing, prolly the answer i was looking for, ty
[02:29] <un_operateur1> you almost never need to run nautilus (or anything else GUI for that matter) as root
[02:29] <nothlit> gyaresu, sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm
[02:29] <blanky> hey guys, I was downloading eclipse-sdk through sudo apt-get install, but it was a 100 something MB download, I stopped it with CTRL+C because I don't wnat to download it right now, is there a way to remove the stuff it downloaded?
[02:29] <Drako60> SilentDis, kernel crashing, X randomly crashing, nv_sata hangs without passing grub noapci noapic, gcc-4.1 segfaults when trying to compile kernel 2.6.19, shall i go on? oh yeah and ioctl errors
[02:29] <DARKGuy> Drako60: what's the problem specifically? :/
[02:29] <DARKGuy> Ah
[02:29] <un_operateur1> drak -- apt-get install -f
[02:29] <LjL> ozoneco: just keep in mind that to run GUI programs as root you should use "gksudo" rather than "sudo" - and also as un_operateur1 said, you should try to avoid that anyway
[02:29] <blanky> anyone
[02:29] <n2diy> SilentDis, you did, at 20:23, but it doesn't matter. I'm archiving with Nautilus, and have a test box setup now to test it on.
[02:29] <nothlit> gyaresu, otherwise, you can check if its a service with rcconf (command line tool) or something like bum, i don't know the kde equivalent
[02:29] <DARKGuy> oO holy hell
[02:29] <SilentDis> Drako60:  i was just having virtually the same issues... my problem is a psu failing.
[02:29] <gyaresu> nothlit: Yeah. I havn't done that yet. Silly me. Thanks.
[02:29] <ozoneco> ok, appreciated
[02:29] <blanky> okay just ignore me, guys :'(
[02:30] <blanky> LjL: you?
[02:30] <LjL> blanky: sudo apt-get clean
[02:30] <ady> blanky, i would help ya but i'm also a new
[02:30] <blanky> LjL: *thumbs up*
[02:30] <blanky> ady: thanks anyways :D
[02:30] <Drako60> SilentDis, PSU is fine to my knowledge, this just started happening since i installed the last kernel security update
[02:30] <SilentDis> blanky:  it'll store the partial files in a partial area until you finish the install
[02:30] <SilentDis> blanky:  they won't affect your machine at all.
[02:30] <blanky> SilenceGold: oohh...
[02:31] <blanky> wow, I already did sudo apt-get clean though :'(
[02:31] <blanky> so i guess they're gone?
[02:31] <cmweb> Fatal error:  Call to undefined function mysql_connect() in /var/www/admin/install2.php on line 69 occures when running a script, does ubuntu carry the function?
[02:31] <gyaresu> nothlit: ls /etc/rc5.d/
[02:31] <SilentDis> blanky:  yes, clean will kill the debs
[02:31] <un_operateur1> blanky, you might need this instead  -- apt-get install -f
[02:31] <blanky> oh well, thanks anyways for the info SilenceGold
[02:31] <LjL> cmweb: only if you install the mysql php module
[02:31] <un_operateur1> or better aptitude install -f
[02:31] <computermc> I am installing mysql-administrator by source, and it says it depends on glib. My problem is that I can't find it in the package manger. Any suggestions?
[02:31] <blanky> thanks un_operateur1
[02:31] <CalJohn> I'm using urxvt (rxvt-unicode) and it sets it's font in ~/.Xdefaults .  However, no font setting I ever use ever works correctly - it sticks with its own font - a nasty one.  my current font line is "#URxvt*font:            xft:Bitstream Vera Sans mono:size=16"  This works fine on another machine (gentoo).  What's the problem?
[02:31] <LjL> cmweb: php5-mysql
[02:32] <cmweb> ljl, i apperantly didnt do a full lamp
[02:32] <LjL> cmweb: guess so
[02:32] <jrib> computermc: mysql-admin is in the universe repository
[02:32] <Drako60> DARKGuy, unfortantly i wasn't able to grab the ioctl errors, as the system froze and it wasn't logged
[02:32] <eyalw> hi, cam driver help, logitech cam
[02:32] <cmweb> ljl, i have it
[02:32] <SilentDis> drako60:  if you're getting random crashes that seem to be kinda all over the place, I always suspect heat/psu first.  just me and how I work (from experience).  other than that, i'm not sure what could be causing such things.
[02:32] <nothlit> gyaresu, yes? what about run level 5?
[02:33] <Starcraftmazter_> hi, for some reason, as of today, when I start gaim, it exits 1-2 seconds after it finishes signing on
[02:33] <eyalw> i tried it with aMSN, it recognized a device named logitech quickCam and a channel named webcam, but the picture is gray
[02:33] <antjmon> sorry to cut in guys, can anyone tell me or point me in the direction of allowing an already configured user to use mythtv?  it is already configured correctly under user: mythtv
[02:33] <DARKGuy> Drako60: x_x SilentDis is right though, sometimes hardware issues can give you a real hard time in software (I've had problems like that happening under Windoze, and it was just a high temp inside the case :/ )
[02:33] <jrib> CalJohn: does it work after you do 'xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults' ?
[02:33] <n2diy> computermc, did you try synaptic?
[02:33] <cmweb> ljl, php5-mysql is already the newest version.
[02:33] <gyaresu> nothlit: just mentioned it for finding out what services start at that runlevel. platform agnostic :)
[02:34] <computermc> n2diy: I found it in synaptic and I'm trying to install it, hold on just a sec
[02:34] <eyalw> hi, cam driver help, logitech cam
[02:34] <ady> i had to reinstall this opperating system 5 times to get it to work right
[02:34] <jrib> CalJohn: also, what is the # for?  I've never used that
[02:34] <un_operateur1> Starcraftmazter_, start gaim from a command line -- perhaps you'll get useful error messages spat out there
[02:34] <un_operateur1> gaim &
[02:34] <Starcraftmazter_> good idea, thanks
[02:34] <SilentDis> redneck heat issue solution:  case side off, box fan in :D
[02:34] <Drako60> DARKGuy, yes i've had that problem on the 3.3 rail before, but that doesn't explain why sata_nv hangs at boot even when the system was off for over 2 hours
[02:35] <admin_> Hello
[02:35] <Drako60> hehe SilentDis i could pull the side off wouldn't bother me
[02:35] <nothlit> gyaresu, yeah but tools are nice for disabling :)
[02:35] <nothlit> gyaresu, but not necessarily removing
[02:35] <DARKGuy> Drako60: heh, in that I wouldn't have a clue since I've never had experience with SATA stuff :/
[02:35] <CalJohn> jrib: no, that still doesn't work.  the "#" was a typo (i was testing different fonts by commenting them out).
[02:35] <SilentDis> i shall return in a bit.  got some stuff to do around the house
[02:35] <computermc> n2diy: that worked thanks
[02:35] <jrib> CalJohn: comments use a ! in those files
[02:36] <nothlit> un_operateur1, theres a ncurses gaim now

[02:36] <ozoneco> how do i put /var/www back to the defaults for the folder and its contents?
[02:36] <n2diy> computermc, nada, does mc stand for motorcycle club?
[02:36] <nothlit> export DISPLAY=:0
[02:36] <un_operateur1> nothlit, you mean naim??
[02:36] <ozoneco> for the rights
[02:36] <LjL> cmweb: what about libapache2-mod-auth-mysql  ?
[02:36] <BillyBober09> How do i install A driver on ubuntu
[02:36] <nothlit> un_operateur1, dunno, its like a plugin or something, i saw it on the blog
[02:36] <computermc> they're my initials
[02:37] <jrib> CalJohn: maybe that was the problem?
[02:37] <blanky> Starcraftmazter_: you were trying to run vnc?
[02:37] <un_operateur1> nothlit, what fun would that be eh? :)
[02:37] <Starcraftmazter_> I don
[02:37] <Starcraftmazter_> I don't think so *
[02:37] <blanky> Starcraftmazter_: if it still happens, try logging out and logging back in
[02:37] <whyameye> BillyBober09: what driver do you want to install? Have you just tried the device to see if it works out of the box?
[02:37] <Starcraftmazter_> ok
[02:37] <n2diy> BilyBober09, you don't they are call modules, what are you trying to get to work?
[02:37] <computermc> n2diy: they're my initials
[02:37] <blanky> Starcraftmazter_: FIRST, though, do sudo apt-get install irssi
[02:37] <CalJohn> jrib: apparantly not.  :(
[02:37] <Starcraftmazter_> whats irssi
[02:37] <BillyBober09> its a neomagic graphics card
[02:37] <blanky> just in case you can't get into gnome/kde/whatever, if you can't, type irssi for irc
[02:37] <Drako60> DARKGuy, also doesn't really explain why gcc would be segfaulting
[02:37] <n2diy> computermc, roger that.
[02:37] <blanky> it's a command line irc client
[02:38] <LjL> !usernames | BillyBober09
[02:38] <ubotu> BillyBober09: Please prefix what you're saying with a name to avoid confusion. See !tab
[02:38] <Starcraftmazter_> irssi is already the newest version.
[02:38] <whyameye> BillyBober09: well...does it work?
[02:38] <BillyBober09>  Tab not sure what u mean
[02:38] <blanky> Starcraftmazter_: okay, try logging out and bakc in then
[02:38] <Starcraftmazter_> ok
[02:38] <blanky> Starcraftmazter_: i suggest a complete restart if you dont mind
[02:38] <DARKGuy> Drako60: No idea either, have you tried using another kernel version? blind guess but who knows oO
[02:38] <whyameye> BillyBober09: why do you think you need to install a driver for this neomagic?
[02:38] <shwag> so why would phpmyadmin be using an old configuration if I completely deleted the old configuration already?
[02:39] <BillyBober09> whyameye: liekt his
[02:39] <n2diy> ubotu, what is this !tab stuff? I've been typing prefixes manually?
[02:39] <Drako60> DARKGuy, no but that was one of my guesses too
[02:39] <jrib> CalJohn: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37276/ is mine and it seems to work, can you try that file?
[02:39] <LjL> !tab | n2diy, BillyBober09
[02:39] <ubotu> n2diy, BillyBober09: You can use <tab> for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[02:39] <DARKGuy> Drako60: It might be worth a shot then :P
[02:40] <CalJohn> jrib: site seems to be down
[02:40] <Drako60> hrm and no way to test my PSU
[02:40] <BillyBober09> im still confused, do u mean the tab button
[02:40] <CalJohn> jrib: ignore last message
[02:41] <LjL> BillyBober09: just try typing "billy" and the the TAB key on your keyboard
[02:41] <BillyBober09> BillyBober09,
[02:41] <n2diy> ubotu, not working for me, but I'm new to irc, where should I go to learn this stuff?
[02:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about not working for me, but I'm new to irc, where should I go to learn this stuff? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:41] <BillyBober09> oh ok
[02:41] <BillyBober09> so`i type the name and then tab and then message right
[02:41] <un_operateur1> n2diy, ubotu is a bot not a human eh :)
[02:41] <un_operateur1> n2diy, what are you trying to learn about?
[02:42] <j0rg3> Hello, all.
[02:42] <un_operateur1> hey j0rg3
[02:42] <BillyBober09> ubun
[02:42] <j0rg3> How are you, un_op?
[02:42] <CalJohn> jrib: still no difference
[02:43] <jrib> CalJohn: weird, I change font size and it doens't seem to affect it.  The other stuff seems to work though (I changed the height to 45 rows)
[02:43] <un_operateur1> j0rg3, good good :)
[02:43] <un_operateur1> you?
[02:43] <Dr34mC0d3r> when i type date I get Fri Dec 15 18:41:15 MST 2006  I need to set it to CST. Anyone???? thanks
[02:43] <n2diy> ubotu is a bot heh!? Ok, I was getting to like him too. I trying to learn auto completion of user names. Tab isn't working for me.

[02:43] <jrib> CalJohn: do other settings work for you?
[02:43] <Dr34mC0d3r> ubuntu 6.06
[02:44] <j0rg3> Very good.  I've just installed Xubuntu Edgy on the computer that I am about to give to my son and I am testing.
[02:44] <CalJohn> jrib: nope.  seems that no settings do.  i just tried swapping round the foreground/background settings, and no colour changes.  weird.
[02:44] <un_operateur1> n2diy, that depends on the program you use -- is this exclusive to aparticular program?
[02:44] <BillyBober09> whyameye, i my problem is that i cant get my screen resolution big its very small like 6 hundreed something x somehting
[02:44] <Krinkle> I installed fine, but I can't boot after restarting.
[02:44] <un_operateur1> cool j0rg3 I hope the upgrade went fine (fingers-crossed)
[02:44] <whyameye> BillyBober09: and you already tried system -> pref -> screen resolution, I take it?
[02:45] <Krinkle> it says "PCI: JMB36x enabling dual function on 0000:06:00.0" and when I google this I only get people who couldn't install in the first place
[02:45] <BillyBober09> whyameye, yep
=== borg is now known as botxj
[02:45] <n2diy> un_operateurl, I don't know, I'm running Xchat, and I don't do enough stuff on the command line to find it useful, but let me go check it out in a terminal.
[02:45] <j0rg3> Yeah.  This is my first Xubuntu install.  A little trouble getting past the onboard video.  Small stuff.  It is quite impressive.
[02:46] <Starcraftmazter> still does it eh
[02:46] <jrib> CalJohn: what if you specify it with a switch to urxvt itself?
[02:46] <whyameye> BillyBober09: try on the command line: "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and go through the menus and add the resolutions you want.
[02:46] <j0rg3> un_op, I see that you are VERY busy.  I'll let you help the people who need it.  ;)
[02:46] <un_operateur1> j0rg3, not really -- just lurking mostly :)
[02:46] <BillyBober09> whyameye, thats what my teacher told me to do but i went through the whole thing and it wont work
[02:46] <Dr34mC0d3r> when i type date I get Fri Dec 15 18:41:15 MST 2006  I need to set it to CST. Anyone???? thanks - ubuntu 6.06
[02:47] <kuto> hi
[02:47] <kuto> how do i ssh in my localhost?
[02:47] <whyameye> BillyBober09: did you select the resolutions you want?
[02:47] <un_operateur1> Starcraftmazter, try this command in a terminal --  DISPLAY=:1 gaim &
[02:47] <jrib> kuto: have you install openssh-server?
[02:47] <n2diy> un_operateur1, it seems to work in terminal, now I'm going to try it here.
[02:47] <BillyBober09> whyameye, yes I selected like 5 of them
[02:47] <un_operateur1> oops
[02:47] <un_operateur1> DISPLAY=:0 gaim
[02:47] <j0rg3> un_up, it looks quite complicated to me.  :)
[02:47] <un_operateur1> sorry, mind the first mistake :)
[02:47] <Starcraftmazter> 5079
[02:47] <whyameye> BillyBober09: what did you choose when it asked you about configuring the screen. I think you choose "simple, medium, advanced."
[02:47] <kuto> jrib: i have the openssh-client installed will that work
[02:48] <jrib> kuto: well you need the server to connect to
[02:48] <un_operateur1> kuto, you need the openssh-server too
[02:48] <n2diy> un_operateur1: it works, but there is seems to be a critical number of characters needed? un didn't work, but un_ did.
[02:48] <nothlit> kuto, you don't ssh into your localhost, you already have access to it, ssh is for 'remote' computers
[02:48] <BillyBober09> whyameye, i have tried all three, I have been through the process many times
[02:48] <BillyBober09> why
[02:48] <CalJohn> jrib: yep, command line switches work.  "urxvt -tr -tint blue -sh 40" is a lot of fun.  I like blue.
[02:48] <Geoffrey2> lesse, my ubuntu laptop is essentially hung again...the desktop is up, but no applications will start
[02:48] <CalJohn> jrib: ;)
[02:48] <un_operateur1> yes n2diy .. because tab has to disambiguate between two or more people whose names begin with un
[02:48] <whyameye> BillyBober09: so you set the horizontal and vertical refresh rates to match your monitor...
[02:49] <BillyBober09> whyameye, my main concern was medium
[02:49] <n2diy> un_operateur1: roger that.
[02:49] <BillyBober09> whyameye, didnt know what to do there
[02:49] <whyameye> BillyBober09: I can't remember medium specifically. Did you choose a large size for your monitor?
[02:49] <kuto> jrib: where does ubuntu store hostname?
[02:49] <BillyBober09> whyameye, 1024 x something
[02:49] <un_operateur1> if tab doesnt respond at first -- its a sign -- press it twice quickly -- it suggests names for you
[02:50] <jrib> kuto: system > administration > networking  to change it
[02:50] <kuto> jrib: where does ubuntu store hostname localhost and the 127.0.0.1
[02:50] <n2diy> Are there any tricks to installing a new kernel with dpkg, I should be aware of?
[02:50] <j0rg3> un_op: Maybe it is just the separate conversations going on.  I've not been on IRC in quite awhile.
[02:50] <whyameye> BillyBober09: that's a resolution, but maybe it is "simple" which asks you the size of your monitor in inches.
[02:50] <whyameye> BillyBober09: is this an old monitor i.e. not "plug and play?"
[02:51] <un_operateur1> j0rg3, it's basically one big conversation -- lucky i have a big monitor :)
[02:51] <Stormx2> I'm so proud I got my wireless working, hehe
[02:51] <BillyBober09> whyameye, its a laptop. Toshiba tecra 8000
[02:51] <Geoffrey2> I am finding when I leave the computer unattended for significant periods of time, I'll come back to find that nothing will start, and the normal shutdown procedure won't work....
[02:51] <Starcraftmazter> any other ideas?
[02:51] <wickedly_cool> wow 830 users and not one operator
[02:51] <un_operateur1> kuto -- /etc/hosts
[02:51] <BillyBober09> whyameye, i bought it used
[02:51] <jrib> kuto: the relevant files are /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts.  If you decide to edit these by hand for some reason, make sure they agree
[02:52] <Geoffrey2> won't work, as in, clicking on the red icon results in absolutely nothing happening at all
[02:52] <nothlit> wickedly_cool, there are, but they don't reveal themselves unless they need to do something
[02:52] <j0rg3> un_op: JAJA!  (I laugh in Spanish).  You are a much better multi-tasker than I.
[02:52] <whyameye> BillyBober09: Google is your friend. I googled for you and the first link has a solution to your problem: http://outlands.ca/linux/t8000.html
[02:52] <n2diy> wickedly_cool: you can talk ubotu, the bot.
[02:52] <Starcraftmazter> ah hey here's something, Gaim has segfaulted and attempted to dump a core file.
[02:52] <Starcraftmazter> This is a bug in the software and has happened through
[02:52] <Starcraftmazter> no fault of your own.
[02:52] <DARKGuy> j0rg3: Jaja, I can laugh too, 'cause I'm spanish, ha! :P
[02:52] <wickedly_cool> oh i see... undercover
[02:52] <jrib> CalJohn: when in doubt head to bug tracker: https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/rxvt-unicode/+bug/65102
[02:52] <un_operateur1> Starcraftmazter, you could try a uninstall/reinstall .. it might help

[02:53] <un_operateur1> kuto -- sudo hostname <hostname>
[02:53] <whyameye> BillyBober09: what you need is to add the HorizSync and VertRefresh lines that the site mentions. The directions are for Breezy but they will work for any version of ubuntu.
[02:54] <DARKGuy> j0rg3: it did, and that's a good start heh :)
[02:54] <un_operateur1> or editing /etc/hostname
[02:54] <kuto> jrib: what is the gnome equivalent of that? i need to administer that without administration in new user i am in new user sorry

[02:54] <un_operateur1> lol no
[02:54] <jrib> kuto: that is the gnome equivalent.  Do you not have the "administration" menu?

[02:58] <whyameye> BillyBober09: "sudo" gives you admin privs. So the best thing to do is go to the terminal and type "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and then edit the file by adding/modifying the Horiz and Vert lines they mention. Make sure you save the file.

[02:59] <j0rg3> un_op:  You are a noble man.  I was just making a joke.
[02:59] <nothlit> The_Jack_of_Club, you can add as passwd with smbpasswd, or edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and change security to share
[02:59] <un_operateur1> Geoffrey2, CTRL+ALT+F1
[02:59] <n2diy> FernandoCordes: roger
[02:59] <un_operateur1> j0rge :d
[02:59] <lufis> What does it mean for a processor to have one speed "internally" and another "externally"?
[02:59] <The_Jack_of_Club> ok ill try that
[02:59] <Drako60> is make modules still required when compiling a kernel?
[02:59] <Geoffrey2> oh fun, I can't even get tty1 to come up now
[02:59] <blanky> GUYS! :'( I updated the kernel through the updates program and not my /boot/grub/menu.lst doesn't have the windows entry!
[02:59] <blanky> How can I Add it?
[02:59] <CalJohn> jrib: so how come you can use caps?
[03:00] <lufis> blanky: why in god's name would you want to add THAT? ;)
[03:00] <n2diy> Does the system abandon the first tty when X starts? I always use ctl+F2.
[03:00] <blanky> can anyone help me? :(

[03:00] <somerville32> !ask | blanky
[03:00] <ubotu> blanky: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:00] <lufis> blanky: look for a backup file
[03:00] <untony2> jrib: i am in network settings
[03:00] <wy> strange. My ubuntu started to crash
[03:00] <baconbacon> lufis, internal clock speed vs external bus speed
[03:00] <jrib> CalJohn: well the size was changing but the font wasn't.  It used to work fine on previous versions of ubuntu
[03:00] <blanky> somerville32: I did ask my question, read next time
[03:00] <nothlit> somerville32, he asked the question first
[03:00] <jrib> untony2: hit the "general" tab
[03:00] <blanky> lufis: none
[03:00] <lufis> baconbacon: ah, thank you
[03:01] <untony2> jrib ok
[03:01] <blanky> thanks nothlit
[03:01] <somerville32> blanky: There is a script to update grub, one sec
[03:01] <Geoffrey2> ok, how about to kill all processes?
[03:01] <untony2> jrib ok i see it i dont want to change my host name
[03:01] <blanky> somerville32: er, thanks, but I don't think I want to update grub...?
[03:01] <graft> anyone got recommendations for a nice video editor?
[03:01] <blanky> I just want to re-add my windows partition entry
[03:01] <jrib> untony2: ok
[03:01] <whyameye> graft: cinelerra
[03:01] <untony2> jrib where does ubuntu store those hostname aliases for other ipaddress
[03:01] <jrib> Geoffrey2: turn off your computer.  What do you mean exactly?
[03:01] <un_operateur1> I wonder if dpkg-reconfigure --priority low; grub helps in that instance
[03:01] <somerville32> blanky: I don't mean the software :P
[03:01] <whyameye> graft: I had quite a time installing it though. But that was awhile ago....
[03:01] <Jordan_U_> somerville32: to update grub use: sudo update-grub
[03:01] <n2diy> I answered my own question, the system does free up the first tty when X starts.
[03:01] <graft> whyameye: there a deb version of it?
[03:01] <untony2> jrib where does ubuntu store those hostname aliases for other ipaddress
[03:02] <blanky> oo
[03:02] <un_operateur1> untony2, /etc/hosts I think
[03:02] <untony2> jrib where does ubuntu store those hostname aliases for other ipaddress#@$%#@$@%4
[03:02] <somerville32> blanky, what Jordan_U_ said
[03:02] <n2diy> somerville32: Would that be in NJ?
[03:02] <jrib> untony2: /etc/hosts, but if you edit the one for 127.0.0.1 you ahve to update /etc/hostname
[03:02] <blanky> Jordan_U_ and somerville32 so should I do that?
[03:02] <blanky> somerville32: oh okay
[03:02] <lufis> blanky: are you sure a backup isn't just hidden?
[03:02] <whyameye> graft: there was but it didn't work for me, so I had to build. But you could try the deb version. Not sure where it is.
[03:02] <jrib> untony2: you only have to ask your question once
[03:02] <somerville32> blanky, :)
[03:02] <blanky> lufis: I searched, I only found menu.lst~ but that's from kate (im using kate to view it)
[03:02] <somerville32> blanky, If it doesn't fix it, I'll tell you how to add it manually
[03:02] <blanky> somerville32: thanks :)
[03:02] <somerville32> n2diy, NJ?
[03:02] <wy> Is there a way to find out the cause of a crash? Everytime I insert a cd, it will crash
[03:02] <Geoffrey2> jrib, ok, I thought someone had told me about a command like Alt-SysReq-K, or something along that line...
[03:02] <whyameye> graft: try this http://www.kiberpipa.org/~gandalf/blog/?p=47
[03:02] <untony2> ok thanks alot jrib
[03:02] <untony2> alot
[03:03] <n2diy> somerville32: Somervill, New Jersey?
[03:03] <lufis> blanky: isn't a file with ~ on it backup? :P
[03:03] <nothlit> blanky, ~ is probably a backup automatically made by kate

[03:03] <untony2> can someone type my nickname
[03:03] <jrib> untony2:
[03:03] <nothlit> blanky, oh sorry, i skim a lot on support channels
[03:03] <blanky> lufis: lol thanks anyways, somerville32 and Jordan_U_ helped enough :), thanks anyways!
[03:03] <nothlit> untony2,

[03:03] <blanky> nothlit: it's okay :)

[03:04] <untony2> untony2

[03:04] <blanky> somerville32: should my menu.lst have the windows entry after I do sudo update-grub? or after I Restart, because I did that command and then cat /boot/grub/menu.lst | less and didn't find the windows entry
[03:04] <nothlit> wastrel, shhhh :P

[03:04] <somerville32> blanky, Should automatically have it
[03:04] <graft> whyameye: cool, thanks
[03:04] <ady> wy, depends if its a partional problem, if not i cant help
[03:05] <blanky> somerville32: yeah, it doesn't appear to have been modified
[03:05] <fj2> hmm... anyone here who is playing counter strike?
[03:05] <somerville32> blanky, Do you have /boot on a separate partition?
[03:05] <j0rg3> un_op:  What app do you use for providing background music while you answer this waterfall of inquire?
[03:05] <slyboots_> People still play that crap?
[03:05] <untony2> thanks guys
[03:05] <fj2> or any other steam-game?
[03:05] <blanky> somerville32: no sir
[03:05] <ady> fjy i would be if i could get it to work
[03:05] <slyboots_> Jeez
[03:05] <somerville32> blanky: See query
[03:05] <fj2> ady ... that means?
[03:05] <blanky> somerville32: Im looking for a menu.lst template file online
[03:06] <blanky> okay
[03:06] <whyameye> graft: you might check the cinelerra irc channel too. I remember some of the guys that actually build the .deb packages hang out there.
[03:06] <toM|vendettA> hi is there a way to get flash to detect my webcam?
[03:06] <FernandoCordes> i'm trying to remove a module named vmnet (vmware networking) when i use sudo rmmod -f vmnet i get ressource temporarily unavailable. is there any way to get rid of this?
[03:06] <graft> use the webcam to take a picture of flash...
[03:06] <carutsu> hello
[03:06] <wy> I installed a Windows XP in the first partition just now. Before that it's a normal partition I used to store large files. After that I reinstalled grub. Later ubuntu can start. But things go strange that it crashes everytime I insert a CD
[03:06] <toM|vendettA> fj2: the steam servers are down.
[03:07] <j0rg3> Hello, carutsu
[03:07] <Geoffrey2> I guess I could just reboot the whole thing...problem is, this problem keeps recurring, and I'd prefer to find a way to make it go away
[03:07] <Galaeron> Hey guys whats up - Im new to Ubuntu and linux ^^ so I got a quick question...How the heck do you get xchat installed? I tried running the apt-get commands and it couldn't find the package and when I used the package-manager I could find nothing there. ANy ideas?
[03:07] <FernandoCordes> wy: never do this :-)99
[03:07] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, you should try that in single-user mode
[03:07] <Thuryn> hey
[03:07] <carutsu> can anyone tell me how to add packages (no programs) in KDE? like Synaptics?
[03:07] <k1piee> sup
[03:07] <wastrel> Galaeron:  xchat isn't in the default software repositories
[03:07] <wy> FernandoCordes: But why does it crash?
[03:07] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Galaeron about universe | Galaeron, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:07] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: how can i get into single-user mode?
[03:07] <k1piee> ok
[03:07] <LjL> !xchat | Galaeron
[03:07] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6.6-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 275 kB, installed size 760 kB
[03:07] <FernandoCordes> wy: don't ask. sounds really strange

[03:07] <ubotu> Galaeron: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource

[03:07] <ubuntu> i want help
[03:08] <LjL> !helpme
[03:08] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:08] <wastrel> Galaeron:  you need to "enable universe"
[03:08] <n2diy> Galaeron: did you try synaptic? System/admin/synapic
[03:08] <ubuntu> how to enter in su to be root admin
[03:08] <tonyyarusso> fj2: If you're referring to us.archive.ubuntu.com, I get nothing.

[03:08] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, in a terminal --- sudo telinit 1
[03:08] <Galaeron> wow thanks guys...replies out my anus :)
[03:08] <lufis> :-o
[03:08] <FernandoCordes> !gnome-terminal | ubuntu
[03:08] <ubotu> gnome-terminal: The GNOME 2 terminal emulator application. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 174 kB, installed size 408 kB
[03:08] <wy> untony2, somerville32 : Any ideas about that?
[03:08] <carutsu> if i uninstall GNOME does synaptics go with it?
[03:08] <Jordan_U_> ubuntu: don't use su, use : sudo -S
[03:08] <slyboots_> Okay, Ran into a crappy problem, Installed Ubuntu after blitzing my drive *Sob* Tried to install Mplayer but, It wont install because Im on a AMD64 bit system
[03:08] <LjL> carutsu: it's a GNOME program, so yes, i guess
[03:08] <lufis> carutsu: I don't think so
[03:09] <somerville32> wy: Does Windows crash or Ubuntu?
[03:09] <carutsu> ok, but how can i add packages with KDE?
[03:09] <slyboots_> Can I not.. force it to use the 32bit version and install any needed files?
[03:09] <wy> somerville32: Ubuntu crashes
[03:09] <un_operateur1> gnome-app-install &      might still be lurking
[03:09] <nothlit> carutsu, kde has adept
[03:09] <somerville32> wy: I
[03:09] <carutsu> i mean i know there is adop or something
[03:09] <carutsu> ok
[03:09] <somerville32> wy: Not sure how the two are related
[03:09] <Jordan_U_> ubuntu: That is a lowercase "s" so it's actually: sudo -s :)
[03:09] <carutsu> but it doesnt display all that synaptics do
[03:09] <wy> somerville32: I can boot normally and as long as I don't insert a CD, it's fine
[03:09] <n2diy> carutsu: unless you have another windows manager installed, my guess would be yes.
[03:09] <LjL> carutsu: Adept, yes. but you can always also use apt-get / aptitude
[03:09] <nothlit> carutsu, you can always reinstall synaptic and use it in kde
[03:09] <ady> wy, its a ntfs partional problem
[03:10] <somerville32> wy: Insert a cd during Ubuntu is running or during the boot process?
[03:10] <wy> somerville32: OK. ignore the windows part. I
[03:10] <carutsu> i like synaptic
[03:10] <nothlit> !linux32 | slyboots_
[03:10] <wastrel> i like aptitude ok
[03:10] <ubotu> linux32: Wrapper to set the execution domain. In component main, is extra. Version 1-3 (edgy), package size 5 kB, installed size 56 kB
[03:10] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: this thing won't take my password. some kind of strange because i only have this one password
[03:10] <carutsu> i want everithing gnome related out but synaptic
[03:10] <theonceandfuture> Is there a ogg ripper that is faster than Sound juicer? Oh and perhaps has something that detects a skip or scratch in the disc?
[03:10] <nothlit> whats the collection of utils to run bits in 32 bit mode
[03:10] <wy> somerville32: during it's running.
[03:10] <nothlit> run apps
[03:10] <carutsu> is there a way to do that?
[03:10] <j0rg3> Well, kids.  It was nice hanging about. This "big conversation" is about to make my eyes bleed.  I know enough that I hope to answer my own questions.  I don't know enough to answer any other questions with confidence.  L8r t8rs!
[03:10] <wy> ady: How can I have this problem?
[03:10] <LjL> carutsu: no can do, synaptic does depend about other gnome-related things... it just can't run without them. they aren't incredibly many, though
[03:10] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, hmm, and you are using your password, right?
[03:10] <somerville32> wy: Thats weird. Never heard of that happening.
[03:10] <Galaeron> Man these links are pretty vast...ill be reading for awhile. Thanks again guys
[03:11] <LjL> carutsu: i suggest you just start by removing libgnome. i don't think synaptic should be removed by that alone
[03:11] <wy> somerville32: yes. weird...
[03:11] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: right, i'm trying the password that normally brings me into my xsession
[03:11] <FernandoCordes> i have no other
[03:11] <carutsu> libgnome...
[03:11] <somerville32> wy: Try searching through the bug reports at http://bugs.launchpad.net
[03:11] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, maybe this --- gksu telinit 1
[03:11] <ubuntu> now i can't understand
[03:11] <slyboots_> So I need to install linux32 then?
[03:11] <somerville32> wy: The forums would be a good place to check too.
[03:11] <wy> somerville32: Ah... Because windows XP can't be installed in Thinkpad T60's SATA disk, I turned the mode into "compatible" in BIOS. Could that be the reason?
[03:11] <untony2> how do i disable remote SSH login??????????????
[03:11] <untony2> oops
[03:12] <untony2> sorry for ?
[03:12] <un_operateur1> disable sshd
[03:12] <Jordan_U_> carutsu: You can use Synaptic in kubuntu, but you will need gnome-libraries to do it, so you won't have any gnome apps cluttering your menus or anything, just do: sudo apt-get install synaptic
[03:12] <somerville32> wy: Most certainly could be. Try changing it back?
[03:12] <un_operateur1> enable firewall to block port 22/ssh
[03:12] <untony2> un_operateur1: how do i disable sshd
[03:12] <carutsu> actually is what i think ill do
[03:12] <BillyBober09> whyameye, it made my screen bigger but not my resolution. I even restarted my PC and then went to resolution.
[03:13] <n2diy> untony2: why would you want too? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of ssh?
[03:13] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: omg i'm tricked out by my own system. with gksu it won't work either
[03:13] <nothlit> untony2, remove the ssh server?
[03:13] <un_operateur1> untony2, uninstall it or configure firewall or remove entry from services
[03:13] <g0tw00d> How do I get Nautilus to open in sudo?
[03:13] <carutsu> can you repeat what should i remove to get everything else gnome-related out?
[03:13] <un_operateur1> g0tw00d, not a good idea
[03:13] <g0tw00d> why is that
[03:13] <nothlit> g0tw00d, press alt and f2 together, then type gksudo nautilus
[03:13] <nothlit> G0SUB, and hit enter
[03:13] <wy> somerville32: Ok. Wait... I'll try to crash it again first...
[03:13] <LDZ420> I am trying to create small databases for my local machine only do I need the client/server apps with MySql?
[03:13] <un_operateur1> theres a reason why you dont log into root by default
[03:13] <nothlit> un_operateur1, a lot of people don't know how to use cp/mv
[03:14] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, hmm .. strange
[03:14] <n2diy> g0tw00d, open a terminal, and enter sudo nautilus
[03:14] <g0tw00d> what is the reason explain plz
[03:14] <nothlit> un_operateur1, for some it would be safer to stick with the gui
[03:14] <Lj> hello
[03:14] <g0tw00d> i get som kinda error when i do that
[03:14] <whyameye> BillyBober09: so you are saying that before it wasn't using all of the screen and now it is but the resolution is still 640x480?
[03:14] <nothlit> n2diy, never use sudo with a graphical application
[03:14] <slyboots_> Okay, I've installed linux32, but it still wont let me install mplayer (Same error message, not for this computer type AMD64)
[03:14] <Lj> somebody speak spanish??
[03:14] <wastrel> sudo nautilus is bad because it makes your desktop file thinger root non?
[03:14] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: i never used this telinit before so i can't tell if it ever worked. is there no other way to force the rmmod of this module?
[03:14] <carutsu> i do
[03:14] <wastrel> !es | lj
[03:14] <ubotu> lj: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[03:14] <un_operateur1> nothlit, I dont know why you'd get yourself into a messy situation that warrants using sudo ..
[03:14] <whyameye> nothlit: why not use sudo with a graphical app?
[03:14] <carutsu> yo hablo espan~ol
[03:15] <g0tw00d> im the only one usign this pc its in my house
[03:15] <g0tw00d> why would it matter if i open my file browser in sudp?
[03:15] <n2diy> nothlit: most of the stuff you can run from a menu, you can run from the command line as sudo.
[03:15] <g0tw00d> im not arguing im asking why? :)
[03:15] <un_operateur1> if you play by linux rules, you dont ever need to use sudo unless you want to administer the system
[03:15] <nothlit> un_operateur1, people sometimes need to install plugins, or configs and themes system-wide
[03:15] <BillyBober09> whyameye, yes its using most of the screen except for now because I hit the Fn but plus F5. Yes resoultion still same
[03:15] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, ok -- try this -- sudo su -
[03:15] <un_operateur1> what happens then?
[03:15] <ktogias> g0tw00d, it is totally insecure
[03:15] <ubun> i can't paste any text inside of vim running in putty! any idea why
[03:16] <nothlit> whyameye, http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo
[03:16] <wastrel> ubun:  putty in windows?
[03:16] <un_operateur1> nothlit, yea, its only then when you really require super user privs ..
[03:16] <whyameye> BillyBober09: and you tried going to system -> prefs -> screen resolution agaon?
[03:16] <g0tw00d> only if the guys sits infront of my pc....no?
[03:16] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: sudo su rmmod vmnet?
[03:16] <ubun> wastrel putty in ubuntu
[03:16] <wastrel> ubun:  putty uses right-click paste i think by default in 'doze
[03:16] <ubun> in gnome
[03:16] <un_operateur1> no FernandoCordes just   sudo su -
[03:16] <LDZ420> What is a module mean?
[03:16] <ubuntu> now i try but nothing with sudo
[03:16] <baconbacon> ubun, ctrl+shift+v ?
[03:16] <BillyBober09> whyameye, yes already said that
[03:16] <wastrel> ok, putty in 'nix uses middle-click as paste by default.
[03:16] <nothlit> a lot of times you need to do something system wide, as in for every user profile
[03:16] <ubun> baconbacon doesnt work either
[03:16] <wastrel> or shift-insert mebby i dunno never used putty on 'doze
[03:16] <DARKGuy> Hey, I have a dual monitor setup here: PCI & AGP cards. PCI one is the one at boot and thus the one in which the Linux terminals are in. I wonder, how can I avoid the secondary monitor (AGP card) to stop flashing grey blocks (which I'm told that's harmful for both the monitor and the card) and just go black like my older Ubuntu install which didn't used to do that?

[03:17] <dooglus> (in edgy, with an ATI X1600 card)
[03:17] <g0tw00d> im typing a command, to open file manager
[03:17] <whyameye> BillyBober09: I'm asking if you went back to that dialog AFTER making these changes in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:17] <g0tw00d> then i close it when done
[03:17] <dooglus> what can I do to fix them?
[03:17] <g0tw00d> how does that make me insecure?
[03:17] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: ok- now?
[03:17] <un_operateur1> nothlit, in exactly what situations do you need to make system wide changes to user profiles?? that too by using a sudoed nautilus??
[03:17] <nothlit> DARKGuy, lol you're helping and asking?
[03:17] <carutsu> hey have wnyone heard of bad battery support? i mean if i unplug my laptop it thinks that has no batery left
[03:17] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, did that work??
[03:17] <carutsu> *no power left
[03:17] <theonceandfuture> Is there a way to shut off GNOME's desktop icons
[03:18] <carutsu> so it hibernates
[03:18] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Well >.> that didn't used to happen to me before so xD
[03:18] <levander> Anybody else using Thunderbird, when you go to Tools -> Message Filters, does Thunderbird crash for you?
[03:18] <dooglus> LDZ420: a module is a part of the kernel which can be loaded at any time
[03:18] <Stormx2> theonceandfuture: Yeah. Check in gconf-editor
[03:18] <theonceandfuture> ok
[03:18] <ubuntu> ubotu
[03:18] <baconbacon> carutsu: did it always do that?
[03:18] <ubuntu> ubutu
[03:18] <nothlit> un_operateur1, people can install themes, edit vnc.config, lots of things that they may not be comfortable doing in the command line
[03:18] <carutsu> yep
[03:18] <levander> Somebody can try it and tell me if it crashes for them?
[03:18] <ubuntu> su
[03:18] <carutsu> never recogniced very good the bateries
[03:18] <nothlit> un_operateur1, menus entries
[03:18] <Jordan_U_> g0tw00d: It doesn't on it's own, it is just that many people forget to close it or simply leave it open out of convienience, which is insecure
[03:18] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: yes :-) its unloaded. where is the difference btw sudo su and sudo?
[03:18] <n2diy> levander: I'm using T-Bird, and I don't have any problems with my filters, or anything else.
[03:18] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: thx a lot
[03:18] <ubuntu> sudo
[03:18] <wy> somerville32: crashed again!
[03:19] <wy> somerville32: Now my disk is in AHCI mode
[03:19] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, :) I think telinit was failing there

[03:19] <levander> n2diy: The flash plugin I think is crashing Firefox occasionally.
[03:19] <wizard> Hey all.  I have a very common question.  WMV files won't play correctly in mplayer.  I've followed a couple of tutorials, but none of them seem to do the trick.  could someone advice?

[03:19] <g0tw00d> noone usign it unless i tellt hem too

[03:20] <wizard> nothlit, thanks.  I'll check those out right now.
[03:20] <FernandoCordes> nothlit: some kind of stronger root access?
[03:20] <ubuntu> and i have directory that say permission denied
[03:20] <nothlit> wizard, lot at w32codecs
[03:20] <n2diy> levander: That could be, I tried to install flash plug ins here, and it killed my box.
[03:20] <ubuntu> how can i enter in this directory.
[03:20] <theonceandfuture> cool I got the gconf-editor to do it for me. But why isnt there an icon for it in the SYSTEMS menu?
[03:21] <un_operateur1> sudo su  is logged by syslog
[03:21] <levander> n2diy: you're sitting on 8 of what?
[03:21] <ubuntu> Fernando don't spam and told me.
[03:21] <n2diy> levander: Well your living on the edgy, these things will happen.
[03:21] <carutsu> hey by removing libgnome does it remove the option to load a GNOME sesion?
[03:21] <slyboots_> Speaking of media.. I still cant install mplayer from the resource packager, It just cries about the fact Im running on a 64bit OS
[03:21] <wy> somerville32: It doesn't crash now... compatible mode ...
[03:21] <un_operateur1> and sudo su is different to sudo su - .. the former maintains your env .. the latter uses roots
[03:21] <nothlit> FernandoCordes, not really, just switches home folders really (which annoyingly will use a different profile), and it doesn't get logged, which is not good
[03:21] <angel12> hey guys, ive got a question on gnome/beryl. i just installed beryl today (my ati card didnt work until the new drivers) and when im using XGL, all the window decorations look old, as if no config files for the buttons got moved over
[03:21] <ubuntu> FernandoCordes hey don't spam.Told the answer.
[03:21] <jvai> heey, how do i lock the home folder in dapper?, or lock folders in my home dir?
[03:21] <cmweb> ljl, is mysql_connect a mod of some sort, one that does not come with the ther packages?
[03:21] <slyboots_> I tried to install that linux32 libraries but.. does not seem to have done anything
[03:21] <LjL> un_operateur1: still, "sudo -s" and "sudo -i" respectively accomplish either thing quite nicely
[03:22] <DARKGuy> Hey, I have a dual monitor setup here: PCI & AGP cards. PCI one is the one at boot and thus the one in which the Linux terminals are in. I wonder, how can I avoid the secondary monitor (AGP card) to stop blinking grey blocks (which I'm told that's harmful for both the monitor and the card) and just go black like my older Ubuntu install which didn't used to do that?
[03:22] <n2diy> levander: Update is telling me I have eight of them waiting for me, two of them are kernels! Why would I want to install two new kernels?
[03:22] <untony2> w00t
[03:22] <carutsu> no its more likely 2 patcher

[03:22] <sud0> wickedly_cool: & u r
[03:22] <Jordan_U_> angel12: Beryl does not use your gnome themes by default, use emerald theme manager to change themes
[03:22] <LjL> cmweb, mysql_connect() is just one function in the mysql API for php. it should come with the php mysql module, for all i know. not sure why it doesn't work - perhaps you need an include statement, though i don't on the web server i use

[03:23] <slyboots_> Was "Acid_Burn" taken?

[03:34] <Stormx2> claudio: There should be more options than DHCP
[03:34] <cmweb> claudio, or check the manufacurers site for a  driver
[03:34] <claudio> there's not a driver
[03:35] <claudio> for ubuntu
[03:35] <claudio> :(
[03:35] <Stormx2> But for linux?
[03:35] <robert_> bah
[03:35] <n2diy> claudio: if your new to linux, why are you running bleeding edge software, 6.10? 6.06 is the current stable version.
[03:35] <robert_> I can't compile an smp ubuntu kernel
[03:35] <claudio> uh really n2diy?
[03:35] <augustin_> un_operateur1: I just want to try restarting network service.. if it helps me tu start firewall:)
[03:35] <cmweb> claudio, try for dabean
[03:35] <drkm> LjL: I see why you chose KDE
[03:35] <n2diy> robert: did you try synaptic? I've had no trouble with SMP on this box.
[03:36] <drkm> LjL: there have been a lot of changes since I last used it
[03:36] <un_operateur1> augustin_, /etc/init.d/network restart   should do
[03:36] <n2diy> claudio: yes, really.
[03:36] <claudio> so? no solutions? :(
[03:36] <Tonren> C'mon guys.  Someone PLEASE help with this.  I left my laptop on and it ran out of batteries and must have tried going into hibernate.  When I rebooted, it hung on Starting /scripts/pre-mount, so I popped in a live CD and my swap partition was no longer properly formatted.  I reformatted it as linux-swap but it's still not booting, and hanging in the same place.
[03:36] <Tonren> Someone PLEASE help out.  This seriously sucks, this is a code red holy shit emergency.
[03:36] <augustin_> un_operateur1: bash: /etc/init.d/network: No such file or directory
[03:37] <un_operateur1> augustin_, btw -- the package that houses  /usr/sbin/service is   sysvconfig
[03:37] <BillyBober09> whyameye, where are you'
[03:37] <cmweb> Tonren, hardrive may be broken
[03:37] <robert_> it complains about /lib/modules/2.6.17.13-ubuntu1/modules.dep not existing
[03:37] <cmweb> Tonren, due to the crash
[03:37] <un_operateur1> /etc/init.d/networking restart    sorry :p
[03:37] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: could you help me rebuilding my grub?
[03:37] <LjL> drkm: well, that goes for GNOME as well to be fair... and i also find KDE looks horrible by default =) http://ljl.byethost14.com/annotatedkde.png is more like what i set my KDE to look (the post-it colors make it a bit ugly, but still ;)
[03:37] <augustin_> un_operateur1: I am installing that package
[03:37] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, you dual booting ??
[03:37] <un_operateur1> augustin_,  :)
[03:37] <claudio> i don't know what to do....maybe i should change the firmware
[03:37] <claudio> !?
[03:38] <Tonren> cmweb: It's not *broken*, I'm sure, because I booted up onto the same laptop in Windows
[03:38] <wy> somerville32: too bad. Windows XP can't boot now
[03:38] <cmweb> Tonren, how big is the drive?
[03:38] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: i tried installing windows over my linux
[03:38] <Tonren> cmweb: 80GB
[03:38] <drkm> I upgraded my NVIDIA drivers to the newest module. The driver works fine for the session, but after I restart the PC I get an error and xwindows doesn't load, for it to work again I have to reinstall the driver.. the error I get is: API mismatch: NVIDIA kernel module has the ver 1.0-7189 but this x module has ver 1.0-9631, make sure the kernel module & nv driver have same version... what should I do?
[03:38] <somerville32> wy: hehe. Enter the command "delete windows, please!" <g>
[03:38] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, and did that succeed?
[03:38] <cmweb> Tonren, same size as mine. How many portions are on it?
[03:39] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: no it didnt
[03:39] <g0tw00d> why would u delete it
[03:39] <Tonren> cmweb: It's partitioned 60GB ext3, 5GB ext3, 512MB linux-swap and about 15GB NTFS
[03:39] <jvai> tonren, try fixing it thru the bootmenu list, as soon as u see grub loading, u may be able to fix the kernel thru that.. i'm not sure
[03:39] <nonick> I am tryingt too change to Xubuntu how can i uninstall gnome desktoip?
[03:39] <Tonren> jvai: I tried booting into single, or with profile, but it isn't working
[03:39] <Tonren> jvai: It's still hanging on premount
[03:39] <g0tw00d> you take away the retarded windows users and its a damn good os
[03:39] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, it has always been better to install windows first since it assumes that the entire HDD belongs to it
[03:39] <Tonren> It gives me "error 0x40"
[03:39] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: i allready tried to rebuild it using the grub super disc -. i have my grub boot menu back now but when i select my ubuntu in it, it crashes while the splash is 2 seconds there
[03:39] <n2diy> FernandoCordes: , that is a bad recipe, it best to install Winderes first, and then linux. Winderes doesn't like sharing the hard drive with other OSs.
[03:39] <cmweb> Tonren, why do you need two linux drives?
[03:39] <fiveiron> does someone have a second to help me get a serial port IR receiver working in Ubuntu?
[03:39] <drkm> LjL: yeah it does need a few tweaks. are those post-it nodes part of the theme or for illustration? lol
[03:39] <_goofy_> fdisk -l should give me a list of all my drives......right
[03:39] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: i seen that
[03:39] <wy> somerville32: Oh, no
[03:39] <claudio> ah.....how can i write in a ntfs partition? i can just read it
[03:40] <Tonren> cmweb: One for / one for /home
[03:40] <drkm> nodes = notes
[03:40] <somerville32> wy: <g>
[03:40] <somerville32> wy: #windows might be able to help you get Windows to boot
[03:40] <cmweb> Tonren, you really use that much on the desktop?
[03:40] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, i'm not too strong on grub .. let me try and find something for you
[03:40] <FernandoCordes> n2diy: yea i ripped winddddderes off after it destroyed my grub
[03:40] <Tonren> cmweb: I really don't need a lecture on partition philosophy right now
[03:40] <LjL> drkm: they do come from a standard KDE applet... but i don't normally use those, i only used them for illustration. if i used them normally, i'd certainly change the colors ;) (yes they can be changed)
[03:40] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: i allready looked up in the wiki but that didn't help
[03:40] <FernandoCordes> tried several things from it
[03:40] <n2diy> gotta go 73 all
[03:41] <claudio> how can ubuntu write in a ntfs partition? i can just read it
[03:41] <FernandoCordes> n2diy: cya

[03:42] <dominussuus> I have a question about the upgrade release polices for Ubuntu.  Say that in a release upgrade from, say, Dapper to Edgy there is a regressive bug in one of the packages.  If that bug is subsequently fixed in the next version of that package, how come I have to wait until Feisty to get the fix?
[03:42] <Tonren> cmweb: Dude, I installed it 8 month sago!!!!

[03:42] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, how did you manage to install grub the second time around?
[03:42] <DARKGuy> Hey, I have a dual monitor setup here: PCI & AGP cards. PCI one is the one at boot and thus the one in which the Linux terminals are in. I wonder, how can I avoid the secondary monitor (AGP card) to stop blinking grey blocks (which I'm told that's harmful for both the monitor and the card) and just go black or in power save mode?
[03:42] <BillyBober09> HELLO
[03:42] <Tonren> OK guys, I left my laptop on and it ran out of batteries and must have tried going into hibernate.  It wrote something bogus to my swap partition.

[03:46] <cmweb> dominussuus i cant get into it any more due to the damn viruses in it     Not one on this

[03:47] <robert_> does anybody know here?
[03:47] <nn> Im running windows in emulator just to use window..
[03:47] <Tonren> OK guys, I left my laptop on and it ran out of batteries and must have tried going into hibernate.  It wrote something bogus to my swap partition. When I rebooted, it hung on Starting /scripts/pre-mount, so I popped in a live CD to check with gparted and my swap partition was no longer properly formatted.  I reformatted it as linux-swap but it's still not booting, and hanging in the same place.
[03:47] <dominussuus> cmweb - it's called crossover office, Google it
[03:48] <LjL> drkm: well, some hints... if fonts look a bit on the blurry side, go to System Settings / Appearance / Fonts / Configure anti-aliasing and select Full hinting rather than Medium
[03:48] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes,  what Os you on now?
[03:48] <un_operateur1> OS
[03:48] <nn> Tonren: hold one sec
[03:48] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: buntu
[03:48] <angel12> robert_, it might, you might just want to stick with the i386 version though, 64bit is still full of some little problems, like no flash players, little media codecs
[03:48] <dominussuus> could anyone here explain to me post-release updates?
[03:48] <nn> Tonren: my friend just fixed that yesterday, i callin n buggin him
[03:48] <Tonren> nn: Thanks!
[03:48] <Henry_> Hey Ubuntu isn't working at all for me.  I'm trying to install it on a partition on one of my computers.  I burn it exactly according to the burningisos guide on the site, but it still won't boot from the CD.  Any tips?
[03:48] <cmweb> dominussuus, are we talking free here?
[03:48] <LjL> drkm: as for colors, remember that in Appearance / Colors, when you click on the color in "Widget Colors", you can use the color picker and pick a color from *anywhere* on the screens - so if you like you can pick colors from screenshots
[03:49] <robert_> angel12- then help me recompile to enable SMP
[03:49] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, ok, two options -- option 1 -- install grub-disk on this system and write out the floppies .. use the floppies to boot other system -- startup and reinstall grub via update-grub
[03:49] <dominussuus> cmweb - unfortunately not, crossover is commercial... open source, but commercial
[03:49] <angel12> robert_, search synaptic for smp. what proc do you have?
[03:49] <un_operateur1> second option -- use buntu CD in rescue mode to rewrite grub
[03:50] <LjL> drkm: and if you happen to like the top-of-the-screen menu bar, it's right click on the desktop -> Behavior -> "Mac OS style"
[03:50] <cmweb> dominussuus, well that means i cant get it
[03:50] <_goofy_> how do i mount a drive so i have read/write abilitys for owner, groupe, and "other"
[03:50] <LjL> Ubotu, tell _goofy_ about windowsdrives | _goofy_, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:50] <angel12> robert_, and i think that the stock kernel has SMP enabled

[03:50] <dominussuus> cmweb - I think there's also a package that lets you install windows within linux
[03:50] <dominussuus> so you can run windows like a program within linux
[03:51] <robert_> model name	: AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+
[03:51] <LjL> dominussuus: that's two different things
[03:51] <dominussuus> but I can't remember what it's called
[03:51] <cmweb> dominussuus, im broke only 15 years old
[03:51] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: ouai merci
[03:51] <drkm> LjL: genius! saved me about loads of time there! I love how fiddly KDE is, there seems like there is so much to it
[03:51] <nn> Tonren: he said he just booted and mkswap'd the swap partition
[03:51] <FernandoCordes> un_operateur1: bcp
[03:51] <Tonren> nn: I can't boot!!
[03:51] <dominussuus> cmweb - what are you trying to run?
[03:51] <nn> Tonren: there's a kernel option to skip suspend, looking for it
[03:51] <LjL> dominussuus: if you want to *install windows withing linux*, you need an emulator / virtual machine. possibly choices are qemu or vmware (there's vmware-player in the repos)
[03:51] <godtvisken> When I record something in Audacity, there is a really high pitched ringing sound over it.. Any ideas what could be wrong?
[03:51] <robert_> and I want to turn cpu throttling off
[03:51] <Tonren> nn: Oooh sweet
[03:51] <cmweb> dominussuus, this ubuntu
[03:51] <robert_> that's lame for my system
[03:51] <LjL> dominussuus: if you want to just use [some]  Windows applications inside your X destkop, like they were X applications, you want WINE
[03:51] <dominussuus> LjL - is it vmware that does that?
[03:51] <Tonren> nn: I am furious that this happened.  Low-power hibernate should NOT toast the swap partition!!!
[03:52] <dominussuus> LjL - I know, but cmweb's question was about wine alternatives
[03:52] <tjb891> does anyone know how to enlarge your ubuntu partitian undestructively?
[03:52] <godtvisken> When I record something in Audacity, there is a really high pitched ringing sound over it.. Any ideas what could be wrong?
[03:52] <dominussuus> cmweb - I know this is ubuntu, so I'm asking why you're looking for a wine alternative - what are you trying to run that Wine can't handle?
[03:52] <cmweb> ljl, wine is not always good
[03:52] <LjL> dominussuus: well the alternatives are WINE, Cedega (these are APIs, so applications run inside your X), QEmu, VMware (these are virtual machines)
[03:52] <FernandoCordes> tjb891: i only got destructive experiences with that issue
[03:52] <Toph> i have a question: i have 2 hard drives on my computer, one with linux which i boot from and the other with windows, I want to access the files from the windows HD (hda1) but the drive doesn't show up anywhere. How do i access it? i have tried mounting it, but have failed
[03:53] <un_operateur1> FernandoCordes, no agradecerme todavia  :)
[03:53] <LjL> cmweb: no it isn't. but to get something better, you actually need to install a full-blown Windows on an emulator like vmware
[03:53] <cmweb> dominussuus, diablo2, redaler2, Flight Simulator, and a slew of others
[03:53] <nn> Tonren: trying to find it
[03:53] <khaije1> LjL: dominussuus: Xen also, if yr lucky enough to have a new-ish processor
[03:53] <LjL> cmweb: forget the "seamlessness" of WINE then, though
[03:53] <nn> Tonren: well.. it hibernates to the swap partition
[03:53] <nn> Tonren: only safe place to do it to, really
[03:53] <LjL> khaije1: doesn't Xen needs modified version of guest OSs?
[03:53] <LjL> (and nevermind my "s"'s)
[03:54] <khaije1> LjL: only if the cpu doesn't have h/w support built in, all new ones do (this may not be true yet, but soon)
[03:54] <LjL> khaije1: i see... how "new" is new?
[03:54] <hou5ton> help with mounting the SD Memory Card .... here's what dmesg | tail gave:  [17180826.664000]  tifm_7xx1: demand removing card from socket 3

[03:54] <LjL> i.e., what does the CPU need to have?
[03:55] <Tonren> nn: Yeah, but it shouldn't have bricked my boot
[03:55] <Tonren> nn: I hate that hibernate support is so dismal
[03:55] <Music_Shuffle> You use it?
[03:56] <nn> Tonren: it's pretty new code, honestly
[03:56] <nn> Tonren: i can't seem to find the kernel option to tell it not to resume the suspend hrm
[03:57] <nn> Tonren: digging in suspend and kernel sources for ya, hang on
[03:57] <LjL> i'd love to use hibernation even though i don't have a laptop. but, hm, well. "perhaps next release" (as i've said for a year or so already ;)
[03:57] <khaije1> LjL: for amd it's called pacifica, for intel it's called vanderpool
[03:57] <Tonren> LjL: don't bother until you hear it's perfect from a hundred people
[03:57] <LjL> khaije1: hm, i'll try to keep those words in mind when i next look at CPUs
[03:57] <Tonren> LjL: Because right now, it's absolutely horrible
[03:57] <LjL> Tonren, well, it's not like i *never* tried it :)

[03:58] <LjL> Tonren: still it never stopped me from booting... at worst, it would hang on suspending or resuming

[03:59] <Tonren> LjL: Yeah same here
[03:59] <sonicGB> cmweb: uh, that knob on the monitor that says "Brightness"... it doesn't make the user brighter :-/
[03:59] <mitchm1> anyone feel like helping me install edgy? as much as i like sitting in the live cd environment, it's not fun
[03:59] <slyboots_> There is nothing in the FAQ about that error though..
[03:59] <Tonren> LjL: This is exactly the reason I don't tell people to switch to LInux yet... :\
[03:59] <Music_Shuffle> sonicGB, LOL.
[04:00] <LjL> Tonren: well most people who don't have laptops don't use hibernation in my experience anyway (except the ones i've told to...)
[04:00] <nn> ew
[04:00] <mitchm1> ubiquity hangs when i chose manually edit partitions. ubiquity uses 100% cpu, gparted doesn't actually launch although the ubiquity logs say it has
[04:00] <un_operateur1> slyboots_, have you read the INSTALL/README's for the source
[04:00] <slyboots_> Yup..
[04:00] <Tonren> LjL: I code a lot, so it's annoying to serialize my work session every time I have to take a break
[04:00] <Tonren> LjL: But I have to do it anyway because hibernate sux
[04:00] <un_operateur1> they usually tell you what dependencies you need to have installed prior to attempting this build
[04:00] <tonyyarusso> mitchm1: I think that might be a known bug - I seem to remember seeing something of the sort while cruising Launchpad
[04:00] <slyboots_> There is no metnion of that error message, I've tried google as well.. all I find is people asking how to fix it.. :P
[04:01] <LjL> Tonren: let me guess... you code in object oriented languages.
[04:01] <mitchm1> i had a look, and nothing seemed to fit exactly.. some said dosfck took 100% cpu or something
[04:01] <Tonren> LjL: Not exclusively
[04:01] <Tonren> nn: Any luck with that kernel boot option?
[04:01] <un_operateur1> slyboots_, you could install the build dependencies in unbuntu via   apt-get build-dep mplayer
[04:01] <slyboots_> It *wont* let me do that!
[04:01] <mitchm1> a log file i found (apport.log) says "executable does not belong to a package, ignoring"
[04:01] <LjL> Tonren: well, "serialize" seemed to give that away :P
[04:02] <un_operateur1> mind the difference -- this is build-dep not install
[04:02] <slyboots_> Sorry
[04:02] <Tonren> LjL: Hahaha, I hadn't even noticed that I used the word in an unusual context
[04:02] <slyboots_> "Unable to find a source-package for mplayer"
[04:03] <nn> Tonren: it seems it's actually handled by the initd that resume uses, i think

[04:04] <FernandoCordes> i need to compile a piece of code on a box that is not connected to the internet. how can i get build-essential and all stuff onto it maintaining all dependencies?
[04:05] <un_operateur1> apt-get build-dep mplayer  suggests i install about 30 packages ,,, i dunno why yours fails
[04:05] <levander> FernandoCordes: build-essential and its dependencies are "probably" on the edgy distribution cd, change /etc/apt/source.list to point to the CD and install from there
[04:05] <nn> FernandoCordes: a ubuntu cd?
[04:05] <Jordan_U> FernandoCordes: sudo apt-get built-dep <package>
[04:05] <mitchm1> no chance i can launch a text mode installer from the desktop cd?
[04:06] <FernandoCordes> thanks guys
[04:06] <levander> mitchm1: you can use command line tools from a console, like aptitude and apt-get if that's what you're asking about
[04:06] <un_operateur1> desktop CD ??
[04:06] <nn> ah... I love my HackPuter
[04:06] <levander> un_operateur1: what is your question?
[04:07] <un_operateur1> what is a desktop CD ?
[04:07] <mitchm1> levander: i want to install it from the live cd i have just downloaded, however gparted fails to start and ubiquity hangs. can i do a text install without re-downloading another 600 megs
[04:07] <Jordan_U> mitchm1: No, you need the alternate CD for that
[04:07] <slyboots_> Are you on a 32bit system?
[04:07] <mitchm1> damn
[04:07] <un_operateur1> slyboots_, yes
[04:07] <slyboots_> Im not
[04:07] <levander> un_operateur1: it's a CD that lets you run Ubuntu from the CD, or you can use it to install Ubuntu to your hard disk
[04:07] <nn> it used to be a "thin client" now it runs ubuntu off an 8gb USB thumbdrive raid 0 :P
[04:07] <mitchm1> wait, couldn't be coz i mounted a partition could it?
[04:07] <Tonren> nn: Any luck dude?
[04:07] <un_operateur1> slyboots_, I know -- but the command ought to work nonetheless
[04:07] <nothlit> FernandoCordes, aptitude download packages, and then install them with dpkg
[04:08] <levander> un_operateur1: how did you find freenode if you don't know what a desktop CD is?
[04:08] <slyboots_> Know what. F*** it
[04:08] <nothlit> FernandoCordes, otherwise,theres utilities like apt-zip
[04:08] <slyboots_> Its 3am in the freaking morning
[04:08] <nothlit> !apt-zip
[04:08] <nn> Tonren: not yet :( hibernate wont work for me.. raid0 and usb thumbdrive room :\
[04:08] <FernandoCordes> levander: will i find aircrack-ng on the edgy discs?
[04:08] <ubotu> apt-zip: Update a non-networked computer using apt and removable media. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.15 (edgy), package size 17 kB, installed size 116 kB
[04:08] <slyboots_> I'll just install 32bit ubuntu..
[04:08] <un_operateur1> levander, i was being sarcastic incase you're misreading me :)
[04:08] <un_operateur1> lol
[04:08] <slyboots_> It would save a lot of hassle I think
[04:08] <nothlit> !minimalcd | mitchm1
[04:08] <nn> It's kinda crazy having my root fs on a thumbdrive, but neat
[04:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about minimalcd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:08] <slyboots_> I had the same problems with Windows :P
[04:08] <ce_indigo> huy
[04:08] <levander> FernandoCordes: probably not, i believe aircrack-ng is in the universe repository, which won't be on the CD
[04:08] <un_operateur1> slyboots_, you could try a different player maybe?
[04:08] <slyboots_> God that wa a nightmare..
[04:08] <nn> I just take the thumbdrives + hub with me, and have a portable complete ubuntu
[04:08] <slyboots_> I like mplayer
[04:09] <slyboots_> And this just seems like a warning of things to come ;)
[04:09] <nn> slyboots_: me tooo
[04:09] <nothlit> !minimal | mitchm1
[04:09] <ubotu> mitchm1: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[04:09] <levander> un_operateur1: people are already clueless enough in this channel, no sarcasm needed here
[04:09] <FernandoCordes> nothlit: where can i find the packages downloaded with aptitude download?
[04:09] <nothlit> FernandoCordes, in whatever directory you were at the time
[04:09] <FernandoCordes> ok
[04:09] <nothlit> !apt-zip | FernandoCordes
[04:09] <FernandoCordes> thx
[04:09] <ubotu> apt-zip: Update a non-networked computer using apt and removable media. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.15 (edgy), package size 17 kB, installed size 116 kB
[04:09] <slyboots_> Mplayer (When it installs..) does what its told and plays pretty much any format under the sun
[04:09] <un_operateur1> levander, no harm done -- you just misinterpreted the context in which i asked the question
[04:10] <cewe_sexy_bth_be> semarang
[04:10] <un_operateur1> anyway -- a CD that lets you run Ubuntu from the CD --  is a live CD not a desktop CD
[04:10] <slyboots_> Its what my xbox uses, And god damn it does a good job of playing anything I throw at it
[04:10] <nn> Tonren: my suggestion is boot off the live cd again, and mkswap /dev/hdaX where hdaX is the swap partition
[04:10] <nothlit> vlc, actually has more built in codecs btw, slyboots_
[04:10] <FernandoCordes> nothlit: will !apt-zip also download all dependencies?
[04:10] <nonick> what's the package for Disable people? I need the Magnifier please
[04:10] <nn> slyboots_: xbox linux? :P
[04:10] <slyboots_> XMBC
[04:10] <nonick> don't let disable poeple down
[04:11] <LjL> FernandoCordes: /var/cache/apt/archives/ (nothlit: not unless they were source packages i think)
[04:11] <nothlit> FernandoCordes, i'm not sure, but thats what most people would use if you did it normally
[04:11] <ce_indigo> huy
[04:11] <nn> nonick: it's GNOME Accessibility, lemme get a pkg name
[04:11] <LjL> FernandoCordes: it's supposed to do that... also you could try
[04:11] <Jordan_U> un_operateur1: The reason they call their LiveCD a "desktop" CD is so as not to confuse old brezzy users where the LiveCD couldn't install
[04:11] <LjL> !offline | FernandoCordes
[04:11] <ubotu> FernandoCordes: If you need to download Ubuntu packages using another machine or OS, http://apt.byethost14.com/ may help you with determining which dependencies to fetch
[04:11] <tonyyarusso> nonick: I think you can also enable accessibility stuff from system > preferances
[04:11] <nonick> nn: I would appreciate that
[04:11] <nothlit> LjL, no, if you did --download-only, it would go in /var/cache... but with download it goes into working directory
[04:11] <slyboots_> Okay, Why the hell do I have to update my package list *every* time I open the package manager
[04:11] <un_operateur1> Jordan_U, ahh, i see .. that explains it :)
[04:11] <nonick> tonyyarusso: I am in Xubuntu, I want that package standalone
[04:11] <slyboots_> They cant have gone out of date in the *Few* seconds since I last closed the program
[04:11] <Tonren> OK guys, I left my laptop on and it ran out of batteries and must have tried going into hibernate.  It wrote something bogus to my swap partition. When I rebooted, it hung on Starting /scripts/pre-mount, so I popped in a live CD to check with gparted and my swap partition was no longer properly formatted.  I reformatted it as linux-swap but it's still not booting, and hanging in the same place.
[04:11] <tonyyarusso> nonick: ah, okay
[04:11] <Tonren> Can anyone help out?  I'm desperate.
[04:12] <LjL> nothlit: ah, nice
[04:12] <nonick> Tonren: I am desperate too
[04:12] <tonyyarusso> nonick: gnome-mag - a screen magnifier for the GNOME desktop, xubuntu-at-mag - screen magnifying for Xubuntu
[04:12] <Tonren> nonickWhat happened to you?
[04:12] <nn> AhH! beautiful
[04:12] <nothlit> Tonren, you can delete the partition and recreate it
[04:12] <slyboots_> Not to brag, But I'm desperately good looking
[04:12] <slyboots_> I thought I would just bring that up, since you mentioned it
[04:12] <nonick> ohhhh WOW... tonyyarusso  at XFCE told me they don't have one o.0
[04:13] <Tonren> nothlit: The bogus info will still be there, though
[04:13] <tonyyarusso> nonick: apt-cache search knows the truth ;)
[04:13] <tjb891> do any of you run starcraft on ubuntu?
[04:13] <Tonren> nothlit: Deleting the partition just removes the formatting info.  The data remains.  :\
[04:13] <Tonren> tjb891: I do, it usually runs fine
[04:13] <nothlit> Tonren, you can zero the partition
[04:13] <nonick> tonyyarusso: thanks alot
[04:13] <Tonren> nothlit: Can I do that from gparted?
[04:13] <un_operateur1> "desperately good looking"   -- there could be a better choice of adjective :)
[04:13] <tjb891> Tonren:how do you get it to recognise the CD after it installs with wine?
[04:13] <Tonren> nothlit: Or a live CD, or from Windows?
[04:14] <nothlit> from a livecd, and the command line
[04:14] <Tonren> tjb891: I think I ripped the ISO and mounted it with sudo mount -o loop
[04:14] <nothlit> i messaged it to you because dd commands are dangerous
[04:14] <tjb891> ok
[04:14] <tjb891> ill do that
[04:14] <tjb891> and then i just have to use the unmount command when im done right?
[04:15] <drkm> when setting the font 'fixed width' in the settings in kde/gnome, what does that actually set the font for?
[04:15] <Tonren> nothlit: Yeah, they can be weapons of mass destruction
[04:16] <Tonren> nothlit: Do the drives need to be MOUNTED for dd to be used?
[04:16] <nothlit> no lol
[04:16] <Tonren> nothlit: Oh yeah; it CAN'T work if they're mounted
[04:16] <Tonren> OK i'ma try that out, thanks
[04:17] <nothlit> drkm, for things like the terminal
[04:17] <tjb891> how do i enlarge my ubuntu partitian, I have a gpparted live cd
[04:17] <nothlit> the ubuntu livecd also has gparted on it, you know
[04:17] <tjb891> yeah but gpparted won't let me make my ubuntu parition larger
[04:17] <drkm> nothlit: ahh ok.. do you know why the font list only contains about 5 fonts when all the other fonts you can set contain your whole list?
[04:18] <nothlit> drkm, i'm not sure what you mean

[04:19] <ubun> i installed all the multimedia stuff from the 'restrictedformat' docs on ubuntu.com but now my videos' sound is out of sync. is there a way to fix this? I tried 'mplayer -framedrop' but it doesnt fix it
[04:19] <sephiron> anyone use dell computer here
[04:19] <ubun> actually sounds starts out ok and by the middle or end of every movie it's way off
[04:19] <drkm> nothlit: say you were setting your 'Menu' font.. it contains all the fonts on your system that you can choose from.. but when setting 'Fixed Width' it only contains a limited selection of your fonts
[04:19] <nothlit> drkm, oh, thats because not all fonts are fixed width
[04:20] <Halitech> sephiron, I've got 1 that runs my server
[04:20] <nothlit> drkm, most aren't actually
[04:20] <tjb891> can anyone explain to be how to mount and unmount .iso images and if there is a gui to do this?
[04:20] <nothlit> drkm, fixed width means all the letters are the same width, so with text, you can line stuff up for things like the terminal
[04:20] <drkm> notbbt: ahh ok that explains a lot, thanks
[04:21] <drkm> nothlit: above was for you.. damn auto complete
[04:21] <sephiron> Halitech:if i buy a dell computer,can i change its part such as ram and graphic crad

[04:22] <STD> Can somebody helpz me please D:
[04:22] <Halitech> sephiron, it will depend on what you actually buy, the one I have has everything onboard but does have a few PCI slots so I can disable some things and use addon cards but without knowing what machine you are thinking of, hard to say for sure
[04:23] <angel12> hey guys, for some reason, when im running beryl, the icon set doesnt look right, it looks like an older version, not like human

[04:29] <rajiv_nair> nn: coool
[04:29] <sephiron> Halitech: if i bought a Dell pc that have PCI express card,can i change it later?
[04:30] <Halitech> sephiron, if it's an addon card then I don't see why you wouldn't be able to change it later
[04:30] <angel12> do you guys have any idea what could be wrong with my theme settings in beryl?
[04:30] <nn> rajiv_nair: Yea, got tired of only windows CAC stuff :|

[04:41] <TangBaBa> I'll check it out!
[04:41] <cmweb> Does the ati come with the ubuntu package?
[04:41] <ThePub> TangBaBa: xorg radeon drivers are pretty good depending on the vintage of your card.
[04:41] <rajiv_nair> tangbaba: wat does fglrxinfo tell u
[04:41] <rajiv_nair> ??
[04:42] <angel12> cmweb, what do you mean?
[04:42] <cmweb> is it already installed in ubuntu i have an ATI
[04:42] <jvai> yes un_operateur1.. i knoo, bot i'm in my account moreso than not... on the weeknds.. we switch boxes alot.. & she's learning gnome more & more
[04:42] <angel12> cmweb, an ati what? video card?
[04:42] <cmweb> Yes
[04:42] <Halitech> cmweb, vnc works on both linux and windows
[04:43] <jvai> if i cant lock the home dir, how can i lock certain folders in it?
[04:43] <un_operateur1> jvai .. even so .. make seperate users on the same machine -- another user may not enter your home dir unless you delegate permissions
[04:43] <angel12> cmweb, you have to get th fglrx driver
[04:43] <cmweb> angel12, copy
[04:43] <drkm> when configuring fonts in gnome/kde what is the font section which determines the font for your filenames in naturlis for example 'Fixed Width' sets the font type for your terminal
[04:43] <cmweb> vnc?
[04:43] <cmweb> !vnc
[04:43] <ubotu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[04:44] <jesusfish> are there any good free Linux control panel options like Plesk (other than Webmin)?
[04:44] <cmweb> Halitech, my friend would never understand how to insstall ssh
[04:44] <jvai> aaar, so it's not posible..? she has an account on this box, but if she ewants to use it in a flash, just for the browser.. is logging out efficient?
[04:44] <tonyyarusso> jvai: Just don't allow other users read priviledges on the folder.
[04:45] <jvai> but how? by locking them right?
[04:45] <Halitech> cmweb, don't have to use ssh and it's usually installed by default on linux, it doesn't exist in windows
[04:45] <cmweb> !Freenix
[04:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Freenix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:45] <un_operateur1> jvai .. well, you can lock your folders using chmod -- but if a user really wanted to get into a directory, thre'd be no problem
[04:45] <drkm> anyone?
[04:45] <factboy818181> Hi, is there some sort of a GUI for the package diff?
[04:45] <cmweb> Halitech, so where does one download for windows
[04:45] <un_operateur1> unless you chmodded using root
[04:45] <factboy818181> it's a file comparer
[04:45] <jvai> ok
[04:45] <cmweb> !freenx
[04:45] <tonyyarusso> jvai: with chmod, just removing the read bit
[04:45] <ubotu> FreeNX is advanced remote desktop technology. For more information and install instructions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
[04:45] <Halitech> cmweb, which way are you wanting to make the connection, from windows to linux or linux and controlling the windows box?
[04:45] <un_operateur1> factboy818181, aptitude search diff
[04:46] <cmweb> Controlling the Windows hehe
[04:46] <TangBaBa> Agh.
[04:46] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Did you try that before you suggested it? =P 1264 results.
[04:46] <jvai> is chmod like.. password protecting the folders?
[04:46] <Halitech> cmweb http://www.tightvnc.com/
[04:46] <un_operateur1> factboy818181, aptitude search diff | less    then :)
[04:46] <TangBaBa> OK- I am following the steps on the BinaryDriverHowTo.
[04:46] <jvai> that's what i want
[04:46] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: The fact remains that you can't really get anything useful out of such a large list of diverse packages.
[04:46] <ski-worklap> what's a good laptop vendor that sells 100% free software compatible hardware?
[04:47] <factboy818181> ok
[04:47] <TangBaBa> When I tried this command (glxinfo |grep direct), I was booted from the desktop to my login screen.
[04:47] <tonyyarusso> ski-worklap: system76.com seems promising
[04:47] <factboy818181> i'll try that :D
[04:47] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: He was asking if anyone specifically new a good one they could recommend. What you did is essentially telling him to google it.
[04:47] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, you can always grep in on what you want :)
[04:47] <Frogger> hello. does anybody know why i can open whats inside this --> http://paste.debian.net/18487      only with mount -a    instead of mount -t nfs 192.168.xxx.xxx:/ and so on  / and so on
[04:47] <ski-worklap> tonyyarusso, i've seen that before, i think... thanks
[04:47] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, do you know of one ?
[04:47] <tonyyarusso> ski-worklap: (if you get one, tell me how it is ;) )
[04:47] <Halitech> ski, check out system76.com
[04:47] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Not for gnome, no.
[04:47] <h0ndaracer2> hey people
[04:47] <ski-worklap> dern, no 17" ers
[04:48] <jvai> hey ppl.. starbucks is closing ty  all.. gn
[04:48] <un_operateur1> neither do i -- but i can point him in a direction where he might get lucky, no? :)
[04:48] <factboy818181> well, the reason why i want a good GUI is that I got used to WinMerge, as it allowed copy and paste compare
[04:48] <h0ndaracer2> i downloaded a file and its in rpm how can i extract it
[04:48] <cmweb> Halitech, ok so what do i do to connect to it
[04:48] <Frogger> i meant cant
[04:48] <factboy818181> instead of saving the files to your hard drive
[04:48] <Frogger> hello. does anybody know why i cannot open whats inside this --> http://paste.debian.net/18487      only with mount -a    instead of mount -t nfs 192.168.xxx.xxx:/ and so on  / and so on
[04:48] <factboy818181> h0ndaracer2: sudo apt-get install alien
[04:48] <un_operateur1> Frogger, why does the latter command fail??
[04:48] <h0ndaracer2> ok thanks
[04:48] <factboy818181> after that, alien the file
[04:48] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: I'm just saying that maybe you should offer advice which is more helpful. :)
[04:48] <cmweb> Halitechyou say i already have it, my friend is downloading and i duno how to connect
[04:49] <ski-worklap> ooh they ship with ubuntu too
[04:49] <Halitech> you would need to get it installed and running on the windows box, then you set up a password and then from ubuntu you connect to the ip address either with terminal server client or using firefox
[04:50] <h0ndaracer2> thanks factboy
[04:50] <Frogger> un_operateur1    it says unknown file system
[04:50] <Halitech> or you can do what I did for my parents windows box, set up a dynu account and run the client as well on the windows box and then you can connect to winblows.dynu.com
[04:50] <factboy818181> hope that helped ;)
[04:51] <un_operateur1> Frogger, what's the exact command used?
[04:51] <Frogger> sorry, that was wrong
[04:51] <Frogger> it says no permission
[04:51] <factboy818181> on a side note, has anyone successfully gotten Photoshop to work with WINE on edgy?
[04:52] <un_operateur1> arrenlex,  aptitude search diff | wc -l  : 42
[04:52] <un_operateur1> I dont see why you got 1200 odd results
[04:52] <brohken> can someone help me out... im looking to buy a laptop and want to know if the specs for it are compatible with ubuntu/beryl... but the ubuntu website doesn't have some of the stuff listed on it's compatibility list
[04:52] <Halitech> factboy818181 haven't tried photoshop but paint shop rfom jasc works pretty good
[04:53] <un_operateur1> and if someone cant weed through 42 easy-to-read results ...I doubt they'd be easy to please
[04:53] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Oh. aptitude's searche matches in package name only, whereas apt-cache search also matches the descriptions.
[04:53] <Frogger> un_operateur1        sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.xxx.xxx:/ serverdirectory / clientdirectory
[04:53] <un_operateur1> Frogger, what was the exact command you used?
[04:53] <un_operateur1> ok
[04:53] <Halitech> brohken, what laptop are you looking at?
[04:53] <brohken> dell 6400
[04:54] <Frogger> http://paste.debian.net/18487
[04:54] <nn>         Gemplus GXP3 64V2N
[04:54] <nn>         U.S. Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC)
[04:54] <nn> From ubuntu, with love! :)
[04:54] <un_operateur1> Frogger, it looks ok
[04:54] <slyboots_> Does Ubuntu (Default install) come with any sort of Firewall?
[04:54] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, did you see me suggest apt-cache search at all??
[04:55] <brohken> there's a sweet deal out for it. $650 - This Dell Small Business Inspiron 6400 (equivalent to the Dell Home Inspiron E1505) is just $649 right now with 1.6Ghz Intel Core Duo Processor T2050, 15.4" WXGA TFT with TrueLife ($10 value), 128MB ATI Radeon X1300 video ($49 value), 1GB DDR2 SDRAM ($65 value), 120GB HD ($55 value), and 8x DVD+/-RW dual layer burner ($35 value)! It also comes with 802.11b/g wireless, Windows XP Home, and a 1 yea
[04:55] <brohken> r warranty!
[04:55] <Halitech> brohken, I would stay away from ATI video
[04:55] <slyboots_> brohken, Take your sales pitch and chove it up your ass :P
[04:55] <manuel_> speak spanish????? alguien??
[04:55] <brohken> halitech... it's sort of mandatory if I go dell
[04:55] <Halitech> and the wireless could be a pain in the butt
[04:55] <Frogger> but on the client computer the command :  sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.xxx.xxx:/ serverdirectory / clientdirectory       doesnt work... i have to mount -a... that works
[04:56] <brohken> slyboots_, WTF?
[04:56] <Frogger> i know it used to work the otherway around
[04:56] <nn> I need windows XP for winamp :(
[04:56] <Frogger> ive done it before
[04:56] <Capslock118> I just mounted two SATA drives, in ext3. If I delete something, it does not show up in the trash, however it DOES show up in the trash through the terminal. I can perminantly delete stuff from the trash IN the terminal, but it doesnt show at all in the GUI....does anyone know what I can do about this?
[04:56] <Halitech> then look at system76.com
[04:56] <kambei> Can any one point me in the right direction... I have several machines and I want to use one machine to authenticate user logins and possibly to host the home directories.  What am I looking for, exactly?
[04:56] <kuto> hi
[04:56] <kuto> what is the free version of matlab
[04:56] <Halitech> nn , why do you need winamp?
[04:56] <un_operateur1> Frogger, have you verified permissions on both share and mount point?
[04:56] <kuto> is it octave?
[04:56] <tonyyarusso> kuto: maxima
[04:56] <CalJohn> nn: for winamp?  if there was ever an inferior program.  why exactly?
[04:56] <tonyyarusso> kuto: octave too
[04:56] <jakub_> hi everyone
[04:56] <jakub_> i'm interested in voice / speech command of utilities on my desktop or even from the command line. is there anything that anyone can particularly recommend as good?
[04:56] <DBO> brohken, we are not your marketing targets, no more pasting ads
[04:56] <nn> CalJohn: the media library is great
[04:56] <CalJohn> nn: tried amarok?
[04:57] <kuto> tonyyarusso: do you know if it is available in ubuntu?
[04:57] <Frogger> Capslock118      View   ---->   show hidden files
[04:57] <tonyyarusso> kambei: Edubuntu has a lot of that in its core
[04:57] <nn> CalJohn: ya, just not the same love
[04:57] <tonyyarusso> kuto: yes, both I believe.
[04:57] <Halitech> nn: try xmms, amarok, rthymbox
[04:57] <kambei> tonyyarusso: But, generally speaking, what facilitates that?
[04:57] <CalJohn> nn: winamp is a pretty nasty program, imo :p  you're on your own.
[04:57] <Frogger> but wouldnt swear to it
[04:57] <tonyyarusso> kambei: The #edubuntu folks would know more about the components (IOW - I don't remember)
[04:57] <brohken> DBO: i was posting the specs for the system I want
[04:57] <kambei> tonyyarusso: Thanks, I will ask them.
[04:57] <drkm> when configuring fonts in gnome/kde what is the font section which determines the font for your filenames in naturlis for example 'Fixed Width' sets the font type for your terminal
[04:57] <brohken> maybe if you read...
[04:58] <DBO> brohken, sorry I missed your convo on scrollback, even still try linking next time instead of posting the whole ad
[04:58] <Capslock118> Frogger: nice, that works enough, but also, how come it does not show up in the trash bin on screen?
[04:58] <brohken> DBO, k
[04:58] <un_operateur1> Frogger, does mounting from within a root shell make a difference?   sudo su - ; mount -t nfs ...
[04:59] <Frogger> Capslock118    that i dont know either, maybe it has nothing to do with
[04:59] <jakub_> anyone know of some speech -> desktop controlling utilities that work well? even for command line
[04:59] <Frogger> your trash
[04:59] <Frogger> on desktop bin
[04:59] <kuto> tonyyarusso: is matlab available in ubuntu
[04:59] <tonyyarusso> kuto: Not in repos, but yes, Matlab sells a linux version
[05:00] <docmur> hello all
[05:00] <KristanoEsperant> hi
[05:00] <KristanoEsperant> i need a bit of help
[05:00] <docmur> I have a problem with the dapper live cd installer
[05:00] <tonyyarusso> docmur: Why are you online as root, pray tell?
[05:00] <arrenlex> !ask | KristanoEsperant
[05:00] <ubotu> KristanoEsperant: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:00] <un_operateur1> !anyone
[05:00] <h0ndaracer2> will someone assist me on installing java
[05:00] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:00] <docmur> ???I shouldn't be
[05:00] <docmur> but whatever
[05:00] <tonyyarusso> docmur: Oh, live cd. Okay.
[05:00] <ski-worklap> system76.com looks good, but unfortunately they don't have enough options yet
[05:00] <docmur> this is my sis and bro's comp
[05:00] <docmur> I need to install linux
[05:00] <kuto> tonyyarusso: do you know if it would install in ubuntu is it rpm or bin package?
[05:01] <tonyyarusso> kuto: No idea
[05:01] <docmur> when I boot the live cd and click in the installer it crashes
[05:01] <KristanoEsperant> can anyone tell me how to put WinXP and Ubuntu on the same computer?
[05:01] <Halitech> docmur, running as root will allow anyone to take over an do nasty things to your computer
[05:01] <docmur> how would I fix this
[05:01] <tonyyarusso> !dualboot | KristanoEsperant
[05:01] <ubotu> KristanoEsperant: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[05:01] <docmur> no my name is root
[05:01] <un_operateur1> kuto, I'd imagine it'd be in a source tarball
[05:01] <h0ndaracer2> just partion you hard drive kristano
[05:01] <Frogger> Capslock118    that i dont know either, maybe it has nothing to do with your trashcan on desktop
[05:01] <un_operateur1> sorry -- binary tarball
[05:01] <KristanoEsperant> thanks a lot :D
[05:01] <Frogger> un_operateur1   what do u mean
[05:01] <docmur> so is therw a way to update the installer ???
[05:01] <docmur> on the live cd
[05:01] <jakub_> Halitech: although i agree running as root is not a good idea, a) he's on a livecd and b) what's the probability he can get easily rooted from freenode?
[05:02] <kuto> thanks
[05:02] <un_operateur1> even if it came as a .rpm .. you could always install it using alien
[05:02] <tonyyarusso> un_operateur1: alien's not really safe though
[05:02] <Halitech> jakub, I had typed it in before I saw he was on a livecd and b, not likely but who knows where else he is at the moment?
[05:02] <un_operateur1> i know -- i'll let you explain why alien isnt safe :)
[05:03] <wastrel> i used to use alien
[05:03] <crzygrndpa> Are there any guides for installing fastCGI or fcgid onto Ubuntu?
[05:03] <docmur> ???
[05:03] <docmur> anyhelp
[05:04] <TangBaBa> Thanks for that link guys! That was exactly what I was looking for!
[05:04] <Halitech> docmur, did you download and burn the cd yourself? what do you have for a system?
[05:04] <docmur> ya this is a burned cd but the cd works on my rez comp
[05:04] <docmur> this system
[05:04] <TangBaBa> I was wondering if you have anymore links on how I might be able to get Xgl, Compiz, and Beryl running on Edgy Eft?
[05:04] <docmur> 1500+ XP with 256 MB ram
[05:04] <docmur> 40 GB drive
[05:04] <nn> Microsoft Windows Vista, now available on 64bit platforms for only the mere cost of your soul.
[05:05] <tonyyarusso> !xgl | TangBaBa
[05:05] <ubotu> TangBaBa: Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - Help in #ubuntu-xgl - See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[05:05] <TangBaBa> Thanks!
[05:05] <Halitech> docmur did you burn it in windows?
[05:05] <docmur> yes
[05:05] <docmur> sadly
[05:05] <ski-worklap> is vista 64-bit only?
[05:05] <Halitech> docmur what speed did you burn it at?
[05:05] <jakub_> ski-worklap: no
[05:06] <docmur> I don't remember it was a while ago way before edgy, this cd works on my comp
[05:06] <ski-worklap> oh nice, no vista for xmas
[05:06] <docmur> I would guess at 52x
[05:06] <ppj> Hi, isn't there a Ubunutu install DVD? I can't find it on the site
[05:06] <brohken> anyone have the link to ubunutu's laptop compatibility list?
[05:06] <tonyyarusso> ppj: There is.  Should be around somewhere....
[05:06] <ValMarko> Is Vista a good choice or Ubuntu still better ?
[05:06] <tonyyarusso> brohken: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
[05:07] <Halitech> docmur, might be the cd doesn't like the highspeed burn, try burning another one at 4x
[05:07] <tonyyarusso> ValMarko: That's likely to be an !offtopic sort of discussion.
[05:07] <brohken> tonyyarusso, thanks
[05:07] <ppj> Thanks
[05:07] <docmur> why would a high speed burn cause it not to work
[05:07] <h0ndaracer2> whats the differnece between linux self extracting and linux rpm self extracting
[05:07] <Halitech> docmur, might just be a fussy cd
[05:07] <ValMarko> yes :) you're right
[05:08] <jakub_> h0ndaracer2: i take it that has to do with java packages? linux self-extracting would be .bin and linux rpm would be rpm based (by the Redhat people)
[05:08] <docmur> Yes but the cd works on my other comp
[05:08] <docmur> ???
[05:08] <docmur> that makes no sence
[05:08] <h0ndaracer2> what would i get
[05:08] <Pie-rate> Flash doesn't quite work right in firefox under linux, is there any way to get a more recent version of it?
[05:08] <docmur> then the burn must be good
[05:09] <h0ndaracer2> yes its jave related
[05:09] <jakub_> h0ndaracer2: get the .bin package
[05:09] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[05:09] <arrenlex> Pie-rate: Dowload flash 9 beta 2 from labs.adobe.com
[05:09] <docmur> but I'll try it\
[05:09] <docmur> thanks
[05:09] <brohken> ok so I want to get the Dell 6400 and run ubuntu with Beryl on it. Based on this page do you think it will be very compatible with Ubuntu: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron6400?highlight=%28laptop%29%7C%28dell%29
[05:09] <jakub_> h0ndaracer2: though you can also build java from source, not like you'll be a speed increase with... java
[05:09] <cmweb> can some one please help me out here, i want the windows to be the server, and i need to tap in to do a control remote desktop control
[05:09] <ski-worklap> vnc?
[05:10] <Halitech> docmur, just because it works on 1 cdrom doesn't mean it will work on another. I had 1 cd rom that wouldn't read a cd but another would on the same system
[05:10] <h0ndaracer2> i need help with installing this java from their website
[05:10] <jakub_> cmweb: what version of windows is this running?
[05:10] <jakub_> h0ndaracer2: dude, seriously, what is so difficult? download the file and extract it...
[05:10] <un_operateur1> you can use rdesktop/tsclient to use Windows remote desktop
[05:10] <cmweb> jakub_, according to my friend its win xp home
[05:10] <jakub_> h0ndaracer2: and ubuntu packages java up nicely, so there's no need to have to go there
[05:10] <jakub_> cmweb: is this *your* computer..?
[05:10] <Halitech> cmweb, did thet get tightvnc downloaded?
[05:10] <h0ndaracer2> ok so apt-get install java
[05:10] <h0ndaracer2> sometin like that
[05:10] <cmweb> No hes a dim wit and i need to get in,
[05:11] <Phlosten> heh
[05:11] <cmweb> Halitech, yes he has no idea what to do
[05:11] <h0ndaracer2> ok nm u dont got answer tat
[05:11] <jakub_> h0ndaracer2: apt-cache search packagegoeshere, now you'll never have to ask "how do i install <x>?"
[05:11] <Halitech> cmweb, did he install it yet?
[05:11] <brohken> ok so I want to get the Dell 6400 and run ubuntu with Beryl on it. Based on this page do you think it will be very compatible with Ubuntu: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron6400?highlight=%28laptop%29%7C%28dell%29
[05:11] <cmweb> Halitech, yes
[05:11] <jakub_> h0ndaracer2: i believe it's sun-jdk-1.5 or something, but i'm not even on ubuntu right now
[05:11] <cmweb> , he does not know what to do
[05:11] <cmweb> Halitech
[05:12] <caminomaster> hi
[05:12] <Halitech> cmweb, does he have it running and has he set a password yet?
[05:12] <cmweb> Halitech, and nether do i
[05:12] <caminomaster> how can i restart esd?
[05:12] <cmweb> Halitech, he does not know how to do that
[05:12] <jakub_> cmweb: well then i guess vnc is the best you can do because windows xp professional and the windows server variants all come with some sort of remote desktop / microsoft terminal services client. regardless, this is a question for ##windows, so take it there
[05:12] <ski-worklap> brohken, based on that page, looks pretty decent. but why do you need me to say so?
[05:13] <n_i_c_k> caminomaster: killall esd; esd
[05:13] <Pie-rate> arrenlex: my ~/.mozilla/plugins directory contains flashplayer.xpt and libflashplayer.so, should i remove the flashplayer.xpt before overwriting libflashplayer.so with the flash 9 beta 2 version?
[05:13] <bruenig> Pie-rate, yes
[05:13] <arrenlex> Pie-rate: Yes.
[05:13] <Halitech> cmweb http://www.tightvnc.com/docs.html
[05:13] <cmweb> dont send me their please i hate windows, I despise them
[05:13] <ivx> hey i am trying to open a program, and it isn't working. when i try to launch it from terminal it says: Applications can not close shared connections.  Please fix this in your app.  Ig what's that deal with this?
[05:14] <caminomaster> n_i_c_k, $ esd?
[05:14] <cmweb> Halitech, whats my username to login to VNC
[05:14] <brohken> ski-worklap, im a noob. just wanna make sure I'm not missing anything
[05:14] <bruenig> ivx, obviously the program in question might be of help
[05:14] <n_i_c_k> caminosmaster: not sure I understand your question
[05:14] <ivx> bruenig, sreem
[05:14] <ivx> bruenig, screem
[05:15] <raize> hi, asked yesterday but everybody seemed busy.  does ubuntu support epson printers from japan?
[05:15] <jakub_> cmweb: ... it's not a windows channel
[05:15] <ivx> raize, what printer is it
[05:15] <raize> i have an epson pm-a850 all-in-one
[05:15] <arrenlex> raize: I suggest you check on linuxprinting.org
[05:15] <bruenig> ivx, ah who needs that, just use vim :D
[05:16] <caminomaster> n_i_c_k, I mean, only "esd" will work?
[05:16] <ivx> bruenig, i'll just try that i guess
[05:16] <ski-worklap> brohken, it looks like getting the display to its maximum resolution will be a pain in the rear
[05:16] <Pie-rate> Still doesn't quite work properly... here's an example: jon.pmtech.com/~jschall/screenshot.png please excuse the 2560x1024 png file, i'm too lazy to resize it =/
[05:16] <n_i_c_k> caminomaster: Sure.  Tho you might prefer "esd &", which will leave it running in the background.
[05:16] <jakub_> Pie-rate: you work at that resolution?
[05:16] <ski-worklap> but if you're happy to do 1280x1024 for awhile until you get that figured out, sounds god
[05:16] <magic_ninja> is there a regular floppy that will allow me to do a netinstall (i dont have a cdburner on this other machine and i gotta install ubuntu on another machine)
[05:17] <ivx> raize, do you have the printer?
[05:17] <Pie-rate> jakub: yes
[05:17] <caminomaster> n_i_c_k, I've restarted esd (my ears hurt: I have earphones :P)
[05:17] <caminomaster> thanks
[05:17] <mhu> brohken: if u have radeon x1400 u wont be able to run beryl with Xorg, only with XGL which sux coz XGL doesnt support 3d acceleration with that mobile card so u better wait for the ati proprietary drivers support in DRI
[05:17] <n_i_c_k> caminomaster: ah those beeps can be a little loud, it's true
[05:17] <cmweb> im in a world of hurt
[05:17] <Halitech> cmweb I don't know, it should be in the documentation or when he is installing it should ask what to use
[05:17] <cmweb> any one wana talk to him
[05:17] <jakub_> Pie-rate: that's awesome
[05:18] <bruenig> magic_ninja, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot
[05:18] <cmweb> any one use yahoo
[05:18] <cmweb> Halitech, use yahoo?
[05:18] <Halitech> cmweb nope
[05:18] <Pie-rate> yeah i've got a dual monitor setup, i'm thinking of selling the 3 17" mismatched LCDs i own and buying 2 acer 19" 2ms response LCDs
[05:18] <Pie-rate> but meh, too much work.
[05:18] <cmweb> ;-(
[05:18] <raize> ivx; yes i have it
[05:19] <magic_ninja> bruenig: i read that, it helped but i'm not quite sure as the best booting method...burning a cd is not an option
[05:19] <h0ndaracer2> i cant figure it out
[05:19] <jakub_> Pie-rate: i work on three 21" flat panels: one for coding, one for web browsing, and one for e-mail. no way i'm going back :)
[05:19] <bruenig> magic_ninja, I think there is some way to do it with the debian net install floppy thing, google around for that perhaps
[05:19] <Pie-rate> jakub_: i hate you.
[05:19] <n_i_c_k> jakub_: what is your graphics card?
[05:19] <Pie-rate> :P
[05:20] <magic_ninja> bruenig: ok, thx
[05:20] <arrenlex> jakub_: Can you do all those things at the same time? =P If not, what difference does it make if it's on another monitor or in your taskbar/
[05:20] <arrenlex> ?
[05:20] <Halitech> cmweb, just checked and should only need a password
[05:20] <cmweb> ok
[05:20] <ivx> well raize plug it in and see
[05:20] <cmweb> Halitech, what do i use to connect to him?
[05:20] <cmweb> Halitech, i got a password
[05:21] <Pie-rate> jakub_: check this out: http://www.ocforums.com/showthread.php?t=489296
[05:21] <Halitech> cmweb, you need his ip address and if he has a router, it will need to be configured to allow access past to the computer
[05:21] <raize> ivx, it is plugged in, and works very well in windows :), it's the only thing i'm concerned about if i switch to ubuntu
[05:21] <cmweb> Halitech, i got that and a password
[05:22] <ivx> raize, do you have ubuntu install yet?
[05:22] <caminomaster> I have an important question: I've heard that is easy to "override" root password, then it makes me fear
[05:22] <raize> no, i currently haven't gotten anything
[05:22] <Halitech> cmweb, just go to http://ipaddress:5802 and it should connect
[05:22] <jakub_> Pie-rate: that is sweet
[05:22] <ppj> caminomaster, you need physical access
[05:22] <ivx> raize, it is a live cd, boot from the cd and see,
[05:22] <ppj> caminomaster, if you have physical access its easy as hell.
[05:22] <raize> ah, well that'll do it
[05:22] <jakub_> n_i_c_k: http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/gxm/products/th2go/home.php
[05:22] <ivx> raize i think printing should work
[05:23] <sk4nK> Hi, I just a "security update" from the update manager, and when I restarted, my nvidia module failed to load. I haven't been able to get it going, is there any chance this is a known problem? or a log that can show me what was upgraded?
[05:23] <ppj> caminomaster, you just single user it and pswd root
[05:23] <raize> it's the scanning i'm actually worried about :)
[05:23] <jakub_> arrenlex: i can afford it and i have the desktop space for it, so why not?
[05:23] <raize> thanks for the common sense though, i'll try that and check back if (when) i have problems
[05:23] <Halitech> sk4nk, there is info on the forum site about that
[05:23] <caminomaster> ppj, there's no way to avoid it?
[05:23] <ivx> raize, wait a sec
[05:23] <raize> waiting
[05:23] <ppj> caminomaster, where is the server?
[05:23] <ivx> raize, do you know how to install a printer
[05:23] <sk4nK> thanks.
[05:24] <n_i_c_k> jakub_: thanks.  I had vaguely heard of those.  They really work huh?  I shall read more about them.
[05:24] <raize> on a linux platform?
[05:24] <raize> i'll go with no, since it'll be my first time.
[05:24] <cmweb> halitech, im connectiong to his ip and nothing
[05:24] <jakub_> n_i_c_k: yeah, it took some fudging though. i can't do accelerated graphics for some reason though. i'll have to figure it out when i get some time
[05:24] <ivx> raize when you boot up go to system>administration>printing, you can swing it from that
[05:25] <Halitech> cmweb dooes he have a router?
[05:25] <cmweb> halitech, you try 24.229.174.53
[05:25] <raize> excellent.  thanks a lot, i'll download the live cd now and give it a shot
=== kuto is now known as kuto|away
[05:25] <ivx> raize, alright have fun, also try to google your printer model then the word ubuntu,
[05:25] <Geoffrey2> is there a command or application that will display all the modes my video chip supports?
[05:26] <cmweb> halitech, he says only a cable modem
[05:26] <jakub_> cmweb: why is it that you are in orlando and he is in somewhere near Palmerton, PA according to the whois?
[05:26] <raize> alright, take care.
[05:26] <ivx> raize, later
[05:26] <cmweb> jakub, im in holt
[05:26] <n_i_c_k> jakub_: ah ok.  I use a Matrox dual head card, which also does not do 3d accel.  That's OK, 3 heads would be just fine, accel or not.
[05:27] <n_i_c_k> jakub_: would you be willing to expand on "it took some fudging"?
[05:27] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: "modes"?
[05:27] <Halitech> cmweb, then either he has a router/modem or tight vnc isn't running and seeing as how I can't ping him, I'd say router/modem or anotehr firewall
[05:28] <caminomaster> ppj, my pc is at home, and the potential "enemy" too
[05:29] <jakub_> n_i_c_k: well for some reason, my onboard i915 kept conflicting with it, so now i have a simple shell script that forces removing the kernel module on boot
[05:29] <TangBaBa> Which is the preferred route: Xgl or AIGLX?
[05:29] <jakub_> n_i_c_k: that and my desktop physically couldn't house 3 24" flat panels, so i had to cut back and use the 21"
[05:29] <matt____> is it normal for an extra hard disk to have to be mounted manuly after a restart?
[05:29] <n_i_c_k> jakub: thanks.  i915 would be an Intel integrated graphics chip, I think?
[05:29] <cmwe1> halitech, windows fire wall possibly?
[05:30] <jakub_> n_i_c_k: yep
[05:30] <n_i_c_k> jakub_: thank you
[05:30] <Halitech> matt___ if it's not in fstab then yes
[05:30] <Halitech> cmwel, maybe
[05:30] <cmwe1> shit, what ip did i give you
[05:30] <cmwe1> halitech
[05:31] <matt____> i am mounting a 200gb hard disk at /home/matt/data, when i restart my computer, i have to mount it each time, is that normal? can i make it "automated"?
[05:31] <Halitech> 24.229.174.53
[05:31] <Halitech> matt, edit your fstab and it will mount automatically
[05:31] <Flannel> matt____: yeh, add it to your fstab.  (I'm sure there's a GUI way of doing it, check system > disks or something)

[05:33] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, I came home from work this evening to another basically frozen computer, I ran through the whole skinny elephant routine and it worked fine, but nobody online at the time seemed to have any idea where to even begin trying to figure out why my computer keeps doing this
[05:34] <Shnax> does anyone know how to fix a Bad PBR error caused by partition resizing during ubuntu installation?
[05:34] <matt____> ok, i sudo gedit /etc/fstab, but now what do i add? where? is  it "safe", what if i accidently put something in the wrong place?
[05:34] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: You didn't answer my question from last time: do you have any other computers on the same network? I'm very curious to see if you can SSH into it.
[05:34] <jakub_> Shnax: use a livecd and install grub/lilo/<boot loader of choice>?
[05:34] <frogzoo> matt____: the docs explain all this in extensive detail
[05:35] <drcode> hi all
[05:35] <arrenlex> !hi
[05:35] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[05:35] <drcode> I installed p7zip
[05:35] <arrenlex> ...yay?
[05:35] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, yes, there are three computers on the network, the other two are running Windows XP
[05:35] <drcode> but I am looking for 7z,7za any idea in what packge I can find it?
[05:35] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: It doesn't matter; if you don't want to set up SSH on wXP you can just boot one of them from the ubuntu liveCD to get SSH.
[05:35] <kitche> drcode: they come with p7zip
[05:36] <drcode> I installed p7zip
[05:36] <drcode> strange
[05:36] <Shnax> jakub, will grub work if I'm trying to fix a windows partition?
[05:36] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, oh, when it was acting funny, I tried Ctrl-Alt-F1 to bring up the tty1 screen, and that did nothing either
[05:36] <ski-worklap> does anyone know why linux-k7, linux-686, etc. are obsoleted by linux-generic?
[05:36] <Halitech> Geoffrey, try putty to ssh into the frozen system from windows
[05:36] <ski-worklap> does the current kernel auto-detect optimizations to use or something?
[05:36] <arrenlex> ski-worklap: They decided that it was hard to maintain.

[05:37] <Flannel> ski-worklap: yes, it autodetects
[05:37] <jrib> drcode: why do you need 7z and 7za specifically?  p7zip gives you /usr/bin/7zr and /usr/bin/p7zip
[05:37] <n_i_c_k> Geoffry2: do you see anything in /var/log/syslog about the time of the error?  E.g. the kernel reporting a soft lockup?
[05:38] <drcode> yes
[05:38] <drcode> I need it bcz I want to use xarchive
[05:38] <drcode> it use warpper with 7za
[05:38] <KristanoEsperant> hey... um... okay. The multi-boot tutorial thing is great, but can I put Windows on the master drive instead?
[05:38] <Jester45>  do you know how to look at how much each ram slot has  like slot1: 512mb slot2:128mb etc

[05:42] <jakub_> KristanoEsperant: think about it: windows installs its mbr and you overwrite it with GRUB which recognizes the windows partition. if you do it the other way around, GRUB is gone and Windows tries its best to ignore the Linux partition.
[05:43] <KristanoEsperant> aye, but i'm inexperienced and have just started trying to learn Linux today. I'm currently running on a LiveCd.
[05:43] <Galaeron> Any got a trick to the users list on xchat? If I set it to resizable user list it doesn't appear. If I turn it off, it appears but I cant resize it.
[05:43] <Jester45> im sorry for the slowness
[05:43] <Halitech> Kristano, you can do ubuntu first and then windows but then you have to end up fixing the MBR to get ubuntu bootable again

[05:47] <MattDaPcWiz> ok what do i do if my network adaptor is not found?
[05:47] <Jester45> Halitech: plus why powerdown
[05:47] <Galaeron> Jester45: take the cover off and look. Chances are if you have 2 sticks of ram, and you know you have a gig, each slot is gonna be 512 :)
[05:47] <frogzoo> roler: to enable dma if it's not on already, edit /etc/hdparm.conf
[05:47] <rastilin> MattDaPcWiz, how's it not found?
[05:47] <Galaeron> jester45: you want to always have the power off when poking around the inside of your computer
[05:47] <Jester45> Galaeron: i have 2gb ram and 3 slots :(
[05:47] <Halitech> Jester45, so you can take them out if they aren't easily visible
[05:47] <MattDaPcWiz> ok i go to networking
[05:48] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: you might be stuck.  Ubuntu probably lacks a driver for it.  Is it an internal PCI card or what?
[05:48] <DaSkreech> Anyone used wget to mirror a directory?

[05:48] <DaSkreech> if i do wget --mirror http://url/path it tells me 404 index.html not found
[05:48] <Galaeron> jester45: chances are you have 2 sticks of ram at 1gig each
[05:48] <Halitech> Jester, if yo uhave 2gb, I would say 1 1gb and 2 512
[05:48] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: does it appear in the output of "ifconfig -a"?
[05:48] <DaSkreech> wget --mirror -A.avi http://url/path does little better

[05:49] <DaSkreech> arrenlex: the entire contents of a folder
[05:49] <DaSkreech> It's only avis in it
[05:49] <arrenlex> DaSkreech: I don't think you can do it like that.
[05:49] <Halitech> Jester45, oh wait, do you have all 3 slots used and have 2 gb or 2 slots and 2gb?
[05:49] <MattDaPcWiz> its a Marvell Adaptor, which is part of a Gigabyte MotherBoard (GA-965P-S3 )
[05:49] <DaSkreech> but wget keeps telling me 404 index.html not found
[05:50] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, and that's followed immediately by Dec 15 12:48:31 jeffrey-laptop kernel: [17223472.732000]  bcm43xx: Controller RESET (TX timeout) ...
[05:50] <Jester45> Halitech: i have 3 slots used 2 gb
[05:50] <DaSkreech> arrenlex: So wget is jsut for downloading html files?
[05:50] <Halitech> jakub_ ummmmm, cause I didn't know about it?
[05:50] <arrenlex> DaSkreech: Yes, because unless you specify a file it looks like index.html
[05:50] <frogzoo> DaSkreech: can you read that url witha  browser?
[05:50] <DaSkreech> Yes
[05:50] <DaSkreech> It's a dir listing
[05:50] <arrenlex> DaSkreech: Of course not! But you need to point it to a full file.
[05:50] <Galaeron> jester: if you got 3 slots used then Halitech is right. 1 slot is a gig, the other 2 slots at 512
[05:50] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: I suggest: remove the card.  Reboot. Run "ifconfig -a".  Shutdown.  Insert the card.  Boot. Run "ifconfig -a".  Any diff?  If yes, you're prob in good shape.  If not, not.
[05:50] <DaSkreech> Can't I glob files?
[05:50] <DaSkreech> It hasa --n-glob option
[05:50] <DaSkreech> noglob
[05:50] <MattDaPcWiz> yes well
[05:50] <frogzoo> DaSkreech: -r - recursive
[05:50] <MattDaPcWiz> u forget
[05:50] <MattDaPcWiz> ITS BUILT INTO THE MOTHERBAORD
[05:50] <DaSkreech> frogzoo: asks for index.html
[05:50] <MattDaPcWiz> kinda hard to remove lol
[05:51] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: ah.. you have a point..
[05:51] <MattDaPcWiz> and where do i type these commands?
[05:51] <MattDaPcWiz> ive just started using linuz lol
[05:51] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: what motherboard?
[05:51] <MattDaPcWiz> linux*
[05:51] <MattDaPcWiz> Gigabyte GA-965P-S3
[05:51] <roler> frogzoo; thanks so much, gxine seems to be working great. just a bit washed out (too bright) but very smooth
[05:51] <DaSkreech> arrenlex: so it's can't mirror say a directory of images?
[05:51] <Jester45> ok
[05:51] <Jester45> thanks
[05:51] <frogzoo> DaSkreech: it still needs an initial jump off page - and no, you can't glob in html
[05:52] <DaSkreech> frogzoo: gives a 404 index.html not found
[05:52] <Pie-rate> MattDaPcWiz: click applications->accessories->terminal and type lspci
[05:52] <DaSkreech> frogzoo: so the --no-glob option is pointless?
[05:52] <MattDaPcWiz> brb
[05:52] <Pie-rate> paste the output to
[05:52] <Pie-rate> !paste
[05:52] <Halitech> jakub_ I tried that on my system and it just shows 256 but I have a pair of 128s
[05:52] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:52] <frogzoo> DaSkreech: you can't glob in html
[05:52] <zcat[1] > in edgy, how do I set something up to run on boot (NOT on login) .. I used to have motion running from my inittab, but now it doesn't seem to happen.
[05:52] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: hmm.. what does the following return: " ifconfig | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f 1"
[05:52] <frogzoo> zcat[1] : man boot-scripts
[05:53] <zcat[1] > do I have to use /etc/init.d ?
[05:53] <zcat[1] > damn, what a pain.. inittab was easy
[05:53] <n_i_c_k> zcat[1] : rc.local, I think
[05:53] <DaSkreech> So what should I use to mirror?
[05:53] <frogzoo> zcat[1] : inittab will do it too, take your pick
[05:54] <zcat[1] > inittab doesn't seem to be doing it any more...
[05:54] <frogzoo> zcat[1] : only inittab is typically meant for session management
[05:54] <MattDaPcWiz> ALRIHT
[05:54] <MattDaPcWiz> it reconises it
[05:54] <MattDaPcWiz> as an ethernet adaptor and that its from Marvell tech, but its unknown devide 4364
[05:54] <Pie-rate> http://jon.pmtech.com/~jschall/screenshot.png can anyone tell me how to fix the black area around the flash animation at the top of the page?
[05:55] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: if it shows as "eth0" or some such yr ok.. if not, I don't know.
[05:55] <poquedoraqu> in case i get no help in #kubuntu, mayebe you guys might know. My girlfriend got a new HP computer that came with winblowz, and we just tried to resize its partition so that kubuntu could squeeze in... but the windows partition is displayed in red, and when you try to resize it says "couldnt check disk, totally 3 clusters"
[05:55] <poquedoraqu> its brand new out of the box :<
[05:56] <frogzoo> zcat[1] : wierd, where's /etc/inittab gone?
[05:56] <zcat[1] > poquedoraqu: just nuke windows ... why would you want to keep it?!!
[05:56] <MattDaPcWiz> is it not possible
[05:56] <MattDaPcWiz> do get a driver for it?
[05:56] <poquedoraqu> zcat[1] : Bd
[05:56] <zcat[1] > frogzoo: still there, just not running motion like it used to
[05:56] <poquedoraqu> zcat[1] : She likes her little windows fish tank program
[05:56] <poquedoraqu> zcat[1] : And this male stripper thing that doesnt work in linux
[05:56] <Capslock118> would it be easier for me to use x32 as opposed to x64 ubuntu? (i have a x64 cpu)
[05:56] <MattDaPcWiz> omg
[05:56] <poquedoraqu> she's extremely shallow
[05:57] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: maybe, but probably not from Ubuntu.  Complain to the motherboard supplier.
[05:57] <zcat[1] > haha..
[05:57] <MattDaPcWiz> it appears mavell has released a driver
[05:57] <MattDaPcWiz> for linux
[05:57] <MattDaPcWiz> lol screw gigabyte they r useless to tech support
[05:57] <Pie-rate> poquedoraqu: maybe the male stripper thing will work under wine?
[05:57] <zcat[1] > 12:23:respawn:su - zcat -c "motion" </dev/tty12 &>/dev/tty12   -- used to work, now does nothing. Doesn't even seem to be loggin an error anywhere
[05:57] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: thank you.  I shall avoid Gigabyte motherboards.
[05:57] <poquedoraqu> Pie-rate: We tried. It flickers really fast on the desktop. And her fish program doesnt work at all - you cant reeally emulate a screensaver
[05:57] <MattDaPcWiz> hahahah
[05:58] <MattDaPcWiz> nononono
[05:58] <MattDaPcWiz> the mobos fkn kick ass
[05:58] <MattDaPcWiz> but
[05:58] <MattDaPcWiz> and u never need tech support
[05:58] <poquedoraqu> These programs arent high on Wine's "to do" list
[05:58] <MattDaPcWiz> besides its not a gigabyte issue
[05:58] <MattDaPcWiz> its a marvell issue
[05:58] <Pie-rate> poquedoraqu: i bet there's a fish screensaver for linux
[05:58] <MattDaPcWiz> and i believe they have released a LINUX driver
[05:58] <DBO> MattDaPcWiz, your enter key is not a comma
[05:58] <poquedoraqu> Pie-rate: I think there must be, but she lieks hers :<
[05:58] <zcat[1] > Pie-rate: You'd think so.. but no.. nothing I've been able to find. They all suck.
[05:58] <poquedoraqu> At any rate, can window sblock a partition from being resized?
[05:58] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: if it's on Gb's mobo, it's their issue.  Don't underestimate your influence as a paying customer.
[05:59] <frogzoo> zcat[1] : there's a lot of tweaks you can do with hdparm to make disk access faster: mult_sect_io io32_support transfer_mode lookahead read_ahead_sect interrupt-unmask
[05:59] <MattDaPcWiz> ok
[05:59] <MattDaPcWiz> alright quick question
[05:59] <DaSkreech> frogzoo, arrenlex: ok lftp -c took care of my problems
[05:59] <DaSkreech> thanks
[05:59] <MattDaPcWiz> marvell has linux drivers, which should i download?
[06:00] <zcat[1] > frogzoo: ?? fishtank screensavers?
[06:00] <MattDaPcWiz> kernell 2.6
[06:00] <Pie-rate> its like flash doesn't support transperency on linux
[06:00] <MattDaPcWiz> kernell 2.4.20 and higher
[06:00] <MattDaPcWiz> anyone?
[06:00] <n_i_c_k> MattDaPcWiz: well I'm a Free Software bigot.  If the license if non-Free, don't use the product.  I'm afraid that might not be much help, but Free isn't always Easy.
[06:01] <poquedoraqu> n_i_c_k: Im with you. she's not
[06:01] <arrenlex> MattDaPcWiz: I have a Marvell NIC that works with the open-source sky2 driver. Does yours not work?
[06:01] <PORDO> since upgrading to edgy this week, i can no longer hibernate. :(
[06:01] <MattDaPcWiz> i have a Marvel Yukon builtinto mobo
[06:01] <MattDaPcWiz> where might i aqquire this sky2?
[06:01] <arrenlex> MattDaPcWiz: Yes, I have a marvell yukon NIC.
[06:01] <MattDaPcWiz> do not forget i do not have internet on the LINUX computer
[06:02] <arrenlex> MattDaPcWiz: For me, it Just Worked (tm) when I installed.
[06:02] <MattDaPcWiz> alright
[06:02] <MattDaPcWiz> do u have link for driver?
[06:02] <MattDaPcWiz> and does it work properly?
[06:02] <Capslock118> How can I put a mounted drive to display in the computer folder instead of in the filesystem?
[06:02] <frogzoo> MattDaPcWiz: well that's first thing to fix - ubuntu without net is too painful
[06:02] <Capslock118> im thinking shotcuting it?
[06:02] <n_i_c_k> poquedoraqu: I am glad to hear you.
[06:02] <arrenlex> MattDaPcWiz: As I said-- it just worked when I installed, without me downloading anything.
[06:02] <MattDaPcWiz> lol
[06:02] <MattDaPcWiz> k
[06:02] <MattDaPcWiz> omg one other things
[06:02] <MattDaPcWiz> which im praying u guys know what to do
[06:02] <poquedoraqu> Believe me, no one hates windows more than me, which is why i want to help her dual-boot. plus, as an artist it will be in her ebst interwest
[06:02] <Pie-rate> show her flying toasters and she'll switch over immediately
[06:03] <poquedoraqu> *interest
[06:03] <MattDaPcWiz> im usuing a dual boot system XP PRO/ LINUX UBUNTU
[06:03] <MattDaPcWiz> and i want to access my other 3 hard drives with linux
[06:03] <MattDaPcWiz> even though they r windows
[06:03] <konam> thats easy
[06:03] <konam> !
[06:03] <MattDaPcWiz> lol
[06:03] <Flannel> !ntfs | MattDaPcWiz
[06:03] <ubotu> MattDaPcWiz: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[06:03] <MattDaPcWiz> how?
[06:04] <MattDaPcWiz> ok guys
[06:04] <MattDaPcWiz> this is the first time i have used linuz
[06:04] <MattDaPcWiz> linux*
[06:04] <MattDaPcWiz> lol
[06:04] <poquedoraqu> Anyway, does anyone at all know if windows has the ability to make a partition blocked from resize
[06:04] <Flannel> MattDaPcWiz: read the link ubotu sent you
[06:04] <MattDaPcWiz> sop go easy on me and wtf is !fuse?
[06:04] <poquedoraqu> because I want  it to dual boot
[06:04] <MattDaPcWiz> ok
[06:04] <MattDaPcWiz> brb
[06:04] <Geoffrey2> MattDaPcWiz, Linux can read NTFS just fine, writing to NTFS is something that should be avoided
[06:05] <MattDaPcWiz> ok
[06:05] <MattDaPcWiz> good
[06:05] <arrenlex> MattDaPcWiz: For your NIC, try "modprobe -v sky2" and tell us what it says.
[06:05] <poquedoraqu> well im going to go...
[06:08] <MattDaPcWiz> error inserting sky2
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> ok guys does mIRC work on ubuntu?
[06:09] <arrenlex> MattDaPcWiz: "error" is all it says? xD
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> lol
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> well
[06:09] <Halitech> Matt, why would you need mIRC? Xchat is the same thing
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> its on another computer in aNOTHER room
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> sooo hard to write it all down
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> alright
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> then i will use that
[06:09] <MattDaPcWiz> but i need my internet first
[06:10] <ladik> hi, sometimes i see in process manager, firefox-bin running netstat, is that normal?
[06:10] <Halitech> or you can use gaim as well
[06:13] <juanjo> holaaaaaa
[06:13] <juanjo> holaaaaaaaaa
[06:13] <juanjo> hellooooooooooo
[06:14] <Halitech> !hello
[06:14] <ubotu> hello: The classic greeting, and a good example. In component main, is optional. Version 2.1.1-4 (edgy), package size 47 kB, installed size 472 kB
[06:14] <nn> how do i get my video chipset (via unichrome)'s builtin mpeg2 decoder and mpeg4 accelerator to work in X? :)
[06:15] <rajiv_nair> !hi
[06:15] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:15] <Capslock118> how can I make bash the system default shell?
[06:15] <tonyyarusso> Capslock118: Use the 'chsh' tool.
[06:16] <nn> tonyyarusso: system not user
[06:16] <nn> Capslock118: instead of say 'dash'?
[06:16] <Capslock118> nn: yes
[06:16] <nn> Capslock118: you'd remove the /bin/sh symlink and replace it with one from /bin/bash
[06:16] <tonyyarusso> nn: Ah, right
[06:17] <nn> Capslock118: rm /bin/sh; ln -s `which bash` /bin/sh
[06:17] <nn> I dislike dash too, but it's technically posix correct, more so than bash
[06:17] <Capslock118> 'which bash' would be bin/bash?
[06:18] <nn> Capslock118: yea, it'll find that for ya, tho
[06:18] <nn> `which bash` executes 'which' a program that finds it's first argument in the PATH var
[06:19] <frogzoo> Capslock118: why would you want to do that?
[06:19] <nn> for some reason, my wireless link quality is very bad mow
[06:19] <nn> maybe the card is overheating?
[06:19] <frogzoo> nn: someone's running a microwave maybe
[06:19] <Capslock118> frogzoo: i am trying to get cedega to work and I read that I need to be in bash in order for it to work
[06:20] <Capslock118> im basically just going with what i can find
[06:20] <nn> frogzoo: no, i think it's maybe heat with the card ;\
[06:20] <nn> this box is fanless and i've made some mods to it recently, but it might be tottally unconnected
[06:20] <frogzoo> Capslock118: you are in bash, it's the default user shell
[06:20] <btrento> hey does anyone know how to make /forcefsck scan more than just the main drive
[06:20] <drkm> how do I reinstall a selection with apt-get?
[06:20] <BenC> drkm: apt-get --reinstall install foo
[06:21] <Jordan_U> Is somebody linking /bin/sh to /bin/bash in edgy? If so, DON'T
[06:21] <Capslock118> frogzoo: this is what I was told, in terms of the console i really dont knwo....The problem is that edgy has a different default shell, dash.
[06:21] <Capslock118>  Basically you need to make bash the system default shell.
[06:21] <drkm> BenC: thanks
[06:21] <Capslock118> thats what i was told
[06:21] <pzl> !assembly comp
[06:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about assembly comp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:21] <BenC> Capslock118: making /bin/sh point to bash is not correct
[06:21] <zcat[1] > Capslock118: I think you have been misinformed...
[06:22] <pzl> !blackbox
[06:22] <ubotu> blackbox: Window manager for X. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.70.1-1.1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 251 kB, installed size 768 kB
[06:22] <BenC> if you want to use /bin/bash in your scripts, then point to it directly
[06:22] <Jordan_U> Capslock118: If somebody told you you you need to make /bin/sh /bin/bash the have a broken script that THEY need to fix
[06:22] <BenC> if you want your scripts to work with /bin/sh, use correct posix shell
[06:23] <max_> Fire Fox crashes when loading a lage with flash, anyone know the fix?
[06:23] <zcat[1] > lage ?
[06:23] <zcat[1] > ahh.. page
[06:23] <max_> page*
[06:23] <Capslock118> x61431g
[06:24] <frogzoo> max_: tried flash 9?
[06:24] <max_> its a FF problem
[06:24] <max_> not a flash problem
[06:24] <max_> !ffcrash
[06:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ffcrash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:24] <Jordan_U> max_: If it happens with flash then it is a flash problem
[06:28] <zcat[1] > finally upgraded to edgy.. seems to have gone quite well. I guess I'll know for sue when Sue uses it.
[06:28] <zcat[1] > *sure
[06:28] <Capslock118> how do i go back to bin?
[06:28] <CraZy675> Hi I'm running a LAMP server and have always used a hardware firewall, I'd like to remove my hardware firewall and use ubuntu's firewall
[06:28] <Capslock118> bash rather
[06:29] <CraZy675> anyone have a link to a good firewall setup tutorial?
[06:30] <frogzoo> !firestarter | CraZy675
[06:30] <ubotu> CraZy675: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[06:30] <Capslock118> shit "bash: /usr/bin/groups: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
[06:30] <Capslock118> bash: /usr/bin/lesspipe: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
[06:30] <Capslock118> "
[06:30] <CraZy675> thanks frogzoo and bot
[06:30] <Capslock118> what does that mean?
[06:30] <zcat[1] > Capslock118: sudo -i
[06:30] <drkm> I installed kde via "apt-get install kubuntu-desktop".. it messed up and I want to re-install it so I am using 'apt-get --reinstall install kubuntu-desktop' but it only downloads kubuntu-desktop and does install anything.. what should I be doing?
[06:31] <zcat[1] > Capslock118: then cd /bin ; rm sh ; ln -s dash sh
[06:31] <Capslock118> zcat[1] : thanks for the save
[06:31] <duckfish> can I change umask for just one folder?
[06:32] <drkm> anyone?
[06:32] <BenC> drkm: kubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage, you'll need to specify each package, or remove kubuntu-desktop, autoremove and then reinstall
[06:33] <frogzoo> duckfish: no, but you could use acls
[06:34] <starz> hey anyone know where i can find the maintainer of w32codecs ?  or its homepage?
[06:34] <frogzoo> duckfish: also chmod . +s & +t can be handy
[06:34] <zcat[1] > starz: google it?
[06:35] <drkm> BenC: how do you do this autoremove?
[06:35] <bradley> hi could anyone tell me what cashe memory is? and what it is used by?
[06:35] <BenC> apt-get auto-remove
[06:35] <frogzoo> bradley: what's your problem?
[06:35] <BenC> bradley: it's the memory used by diskcache, and the kernel uses it...it's also free'd when you need it, so don't worry about how much is being used
[06:36] <zcat[1] > !moo
[06:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about moo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:36] <drkm> BenC: ah ok.. so I am doing: apt-get autoremove kde? or kubuntu-desktop?
[06:36] <zcat[1] > I see ubotu doesn't have super-cow powers
[06:36] <BenC> drkm: No, apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop; apt-get auto-remove
[06:36] <starz> zcat[1] , unlike the ignorant masses i actually do know about google and use it.
[06:37] <starz> i only bother to ask as ive not found the answer, and wish to.
[06:37] <ski-worklap> what are some good free as in beer games for linux?
[06:37] <bradley> frogzoo, my computer seems to glitch sometimes so i added the memory graph to my panel and it says that my 63% of the memory is used in cache.
[06:37] <zcat[1] > starz: yeah, I can't find it either :)
[06:37] <drkm> BenC: thank you.. that actually seems to be doing something I wanted it to :p
[06:37] <ski-worklap> i've got tuxracer and rogue, and what i can find online with flash, but that's it so far
[06:37] <frogzoo> ski-worklap: lincity-ng & battle of wesnoth are good strategy games
[06:37] <zcat[1] > ski-worklap: nexuis ?
[06:38] <zcat[1] > sorry, nexuiz
[06:38] <Capslock118> whats the difference between video ram and agp mem available?
[06:38] <starz> and apparently aptitude thinks its not a real package ~_____________~
[06:38] <bradley> frogzoo, i am not sure if that is normal or too high.
[06:38] <bradley> or if it would cause a freeze
[06:38] <mikemike> I'll ask again.   I've got a PLC putting .txt files on a server. I need to talk to an AS400 speaking UNIX.   I want to model that in Linux.  Should the Linux poll the txt files or is there a better way.  I'm not a programmer but not an idiot.Just looking for a point in the right direction.
[06:39] <frogzoo> bradley: it's normal - linux doesn't leave your mem sitting idle, but uses it internally, & releases as necessary
[06:39] <ski-worklap> zcat[1] , frogzoo thanks - i'll check those out
[06:39] <Jordan_U> When there are too many animations happening at once beryl slows down so much that it might as whell be frozen, should I report that as a bug ?
[06:39] <zcat[1] > ski-worklap: enable the seveas repo and install ubuntu-games metapackage, it's got all the best games
[06:39] <bradley> frogzoo, so i would only need to concern myself with memory used by programs?
[06:40] <ski-worklap> zcat[1] , oh nice
[06:40] <ski-worklap> wow that is a lot of games
[06:40] <duckfish> frogzoo: are they automatic; does it set the perms when you create a new file?
[06:40] <frogzoo> bradley: yes, try htop
[06:41] <frogzoo> duckfish: really depends what you're trying to do
[06:41] <bradley> frogzoo, great thanks. what is htop? (or i guess i can google and figure it out) so thanks again!
[06:42] <zcat[1] > !htop
[06:42] <ubotu> htop: interactive processes viewer. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.6.2-1 (edgy), package size 42 kB, installed size 172 kB
[06:42] <navaburo_> Whats the secret to java in firefox 2?
[06:42] <Born_In_Xixax> seveas repo?
[06:42] <duckfish> frogzoo: I want it so that when I right-click and go to Create Document > Empty File in /var/www, it makes the file with perms 775
[06:42] <zcat[1] > navaburo: tell me when you find it :)
[06:43] <ski-worklap> navaburo, what's wrong with java in ffox2?
[06:43] <ski-worklap> i find it crashes with certain apps but other apps are fine.
[06:43] <duckfish> frogzoo: or if I do 'gedit /var/www/a-new-file'
[06:43] <ski-worklap> is that what you're talking about?
[06:43] <navaburo_> whats not wrong? the faqs say to link from a nonexistant directory: /usr/java
[06:43] <navaburo_> anyone else on edgy with ffx2 and sunjava?
[06:47] <Pie-rate> navaburo_: give me an example of an app that crashes?
[06:47] <loki505> how can i find shoutcast tv stations
[06:47] <navaburo_> Pie-rate, no app crashes, i just cant get java installed
[06:47] <Pie-rate> oh, it was ski-worklap that had crashes
[06:47] <frogzoo> duckfish: best option - 'sudo chmod +s /var/www' & add users to www-data as necessary
[06:47] <navaburo_> loki505, there is a realy nifty php page out there that does it for you
[06:47] <Pie-rate> ski-worklap, what applet crashes?
[06:48] <frogzoo> duckfish: 'sudo chgrp www-data /var/www' also
=== [a] freebsd_fan is now known as _Unsure
=== _Unsure is now known as freebsd_fan
[06:49] <jakub_> frogzoo: chown user:group file/directory/symlink/etc works as well

[06:51] <MattDaPcWiz> alright
[06:51] <MattDaPcWiz> im back and im pissed lol
[06:51] <MattDaPcWiz> i still have not connected internet
[06:51] <MattDaPcWiz> and it still does not show my adaptopr
[06:52] <MattDaPcWiz> someone must've had this problem
[06:52] <MattDaPcWiz> anyone?
[06:52] <jakub_> Pie-rate: nice find
[06:52] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: no one is going to remember all your problems. please state them again
[06:52] <MattDaPcWiz> lol
[06:53] <MattDaPcWiz> well nothing matters except the network adaptor not showing
[06:53] <MattDaPcWiz> ther rest can be fixed when i get xchat working on the computer in question
[06:53] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: and what network adapter is that?
[06:53] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: that's bloatware, imho and for your objective, irssi will suffice
[06:53] <MattDaPcWiz> it is a Marvell Yukon adaptor built into a Gigabyte Motherboard
[06:54] <MattDaPcWiz> ok
[06:54] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: that doesn't sound ilke something i've heard of before, which might mean it's somewhat esoteric and not in the standard ubuntu generic kernel
[06:54] <MattDaPcWiz> nonno
[06:54] <MattDaPcWiz> i have been googleing for ages
[06:54] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: in that case, you'll have to compile your own kernel (possibly convert to a deb and install)
[06:54] <MattDaPcWiz> it was fixed for a long time
[06:54] <MattDaPcWiz> but now its not wtf? lol
[06:54] <jakub_> what's not "fixed"?
[06:54] <Born_In_Xixax> i have a marvell pci wirless card, i had to use ndiswrapper
[06:54] <MattDaPcWiz> well
[06:55] <MattDaPcWiz> it knows that there is a device there
[06:55] <MattDaPcWiz> it just does not recognise it
[06:55] <MattDaPcWiz> and in turn
[06:55] <MattDaPcWiz> does not show it when i go to networking
[06:55] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: my openbsd box recognizes i have RAID 0+1, but that doesn't mean RAID works on it
[06:55] <MattDaPcWiz> which means i cannot coonfigure it for my network
[06:55] <MattDaPcWiz> yes i know
[06:55] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: maybe you should delve into a non-GUI environment in case the GUI doesn't support all the options
[06:55] <MattDaPcWiz> this is just it
[06:55] <Born_In_Xixax> have you tried the nidswrapper path?
[06:56] <MattDaPcWiz> it has worked on previous version of Ubuntu
[06:56] <MattDaPcWiz> without any configuration
[06:56] <Born_In_Xixax> are you on edgy?
[06:56] <MattDaPcWiz> edgy?
[06:56] <Born_In_Xixax> what version of ubuntu
[06:56] <MattDaPcWiz> 6.10
[06:56] <Born_In_Xixax> are yo uahving trouble with
[06:56] <MattDaPcWiz> just got it an hour ago
[06:56] <jakub_> wait, this *is* an ethernet card, correct? or am i Google'ing incorrectly here?
[06:56] <MattDaPcWiz> my other things are not issues, but rather things to do
[06:57] <jakub_> because ndiswrapper has *nothing* to do with it in that case
[06:57] <MattDaPcWiz> its and ethernet ADAPTOR not a card, it is built into the motherboard
[06:57] <sonicGB> Marvel Yukon is gigabit ethernet IIRC....
[06:57] <MattDaPcWiz> yes
[06:57] <sonicGB> MattDaPcWiz: adaptor/card doesn't really matter.. .they both end up on the PCI bus, both work the same way
[06:57] <MattDaPcWiz> crap
[06:57] <MattDaPcWiz> lol
[06:58] <MattDaPcWiz> im too used to xp
[06:58] <sonicGB> OK... I think I've had a marvel yukon adaptor working on gentoo somewhere...
[06:58] <Born_In_Xixax> i've heard that 6.10 lost support for some kinds of marginal network cards, mostly wireless
[06:58] <sonicGB> MattDaPcWiz: XP sees it the same way
[06:58] <MattDaPcWiz> yeh but xp recognises it
[06:58] <sonicGB> MattDaPcWiz: I came in late on this discussion... what's the actual problem you're having with it?
[06:59] <MattDaPcWiz> and xp mojority of stuff is done 4 u
[06:59] <sonicGB> (lol, 'frogzoo' what a cool mac!)
[06:59] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: uhm.. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=active&rls=en&hs=6ES&q=Marvell+Yukon+kernel+module&btnG=Search shows you what kernel module you need
[06:59] <MattDaPcWiz> ok lol u forget
[06:59] <sonicGB> MattDaPcWiz: I wouldn't go quite that far.... (done for you!)
[06:59] <MattDaPcWiz> i have no idea bout linux
[06:59] <MattDaPcWiz> at all
[06:59] <MattDaPcWiz> well
[06:59] <MattDaPcWiz> most thingsr sonic
[06:59] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: so, like i said before, roll your own kernel and install it with checkinstall
[06:59] <sonicGB> ^s/mac/nick/
[06:59] <MattDaPcWiz> man i dont know what u r saying
[07:00] <MattDaPcWiz> i know ur talkin bout parts of linux
[07:00] <MattDaPcWiz> but
[07:00] <MattDaPcWiz> i have nver used it b4
[07:00] <arrenlex> !enter | MattDaPcWiz
[07:00] <ubotu> MattDaPcWiz: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[07:00] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: then go use Google, honestly
[07:00] <MattDaPcWiz> and i dont know where stuff is or how to use it
[07:00] <sonicGB> jakub_: if he's just said "I have no idea about linux" then we might need to give him a *little* bit more help than "roll your own and you'll be fine dude"!!!
[07:00] <MattDaPcWiz> thank u sonic
[07:00] <sonicGB> jakub_: please go and read up on ubuntu philosphy.... please
[07:01] <jakub_> sonicGB: i don't think "i have no idea about linux" deserves any better. if you aren't willing to meet me halfway, then why bother?
[07:01] <jakub_> sonicGB: i'm more of a coder than a philosopher
[07:01] <duckfish> how do I set it so that newly created files/folders inherit the parent folder's permissions - but *only* for a certain folder? ie, in a folder with perms 765, all files/folders created in that folder will inherit the perms 765?
[07:01] <sonicGB> so you're using ubuntu 6.10 right? (I have nfi about those edgy dapper whassname words)
[07:01] <MattDaPcWiz> yes i am
[07:02] <Born_In_Xixax> which prior version of ubuntu worked for you?
[07:02] <sonicGB> ahhh... cr*p... firefox crashed again... (I'm on a mac here... first ever mac, had it for a week, and I'm still struggling!!!... gimme a minute!
[07:02] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: i would start by reading some sort of UNIX/UNIX-like or introduction online. get used to the environment, and when you're ready, feel free to play around with it. but ignorance really isn't an excuse
[07:02] <MattDaPcWiz> uhhhhhhh lol not sure, i got it from a magazine orginally, then decided to go for the full things today after like 2 months
[07:02] <Born_In_Xixax> could have been 6.04
[07:03] <MattDaPcWiz> look guys the point is, after today internet will not be an option for me unelss i get it working on this linux pc
[07:03] <Born_In_Xixax> you might try downloading that version
[07:03] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: okay, question for you then: what do you *need* linux for? i'm all for its use, but if you're a hardcore windows user, why bother installing linux if you don't want to put in the effort?
[07:04] <MattDaPcWiz> i do want to put in the effort
[07:04] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: honest question because i'm also all for using the best tool that you got
[07:04] <MattDaPcWiz> thats why im doing this, thats why i got onto the IRC channel
[07:04] <MattDaPcWiz> xp is far less stable
[07:04] <MattDaPcWiz> when u run servers liek i do
[07:04] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: not really, if you had put in the effort, my 2 second google would have been more like a 2 hour hunt for you problem
[07:05] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: apparently, if the card works on windows, isn't windows more stable?
[07:05] <Born_In_Xixax> easiest suggestion would be to use 6.04, otherwise you appear to be looking at obtaining and installing a custom module/driver
[07:05] <natalie> Can anybody help me with a problem... Whenever I attempt to install Ubuntu 6.06 from the live CD it freezes at the GDM... The only way that I can install 5.10 is with a stage 2 install inside of stage 1... There are very few distros of linux that I can install.... I could really use some help or be pointed in the correct direction
[07:05] <Born_In_Xixax> or otherwise dabbling in non newbie linux stuff
[07:05] <MattDaPcWiz> jakub that does not make any sense
[07:05] <jakub_> how does that not make sense?
[07:05] <jakub_> it works on windows, therefore it's already a step ahead of where you are with linux, right?
[07:06] <MattDaPcWiz> u said that if i put in MORE effort ur 2 second google would have been 2 hours for me
[07:06] <sonicGB> jakub_: PLEASE help, or stop.
[07:06] <jakub_> you can actually access the internet with windows, you can't currently with linux without compiling your own kernel
[07:06] <jakub_> sonicGB: i am helping
[07:06] <MattDaPcWiz> im using a seperate computer
[07:06] <MattDaPcWiz> my xp is a bit shall we say
[07:06] <sonicGB> MattDaPcWiz: I'm gargling for solutions here. Looks like this is a driver that existed in whatever number 'dapper' is, and dissapeared in 6.10.... I think we knew that already, right?
[07:06] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: okay, so then let me clarify one thing: does the card work *at all* on windows?
[07:07] <MattDaPcWiz> yes
[07:07] <jakub_> okay, so what's wrong with xp?
[07:07] <MattDaPcWiz> im trying to set up a dual boot
[07:07] <sonicGB> does #ubuntu have moderators, 'cos we need one here
[07:07] <jakedahn> hey, can anyone help me fix up my audio?
[07:07] <Born_In_Xixax> would ndiswrapper help in this situation?
[07:07] <MattDaPcWiz> xp is gr8 for gaming etc. but not always for HOSTING the gaming servers
[07:07] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: why though? what's *wrong* with windows? or do you want to test linux out?
[07:07] <MattDaPcWiz> im trying to test it
[07:07] <ski-worklap> Pie-rate, i think it was pjirc that crashes
[07:07] <jakub_> sonicGB: what is wrong with what i am saying?
[07:07] <MattDaPcWiz> against xp
[07:08] <ski-worklap> azureus also crashes for me after a bit of usage
[07:08] <MattDaPcWiz> when hosting servers
[07:08] <ski-worklap> and gets itself into a place where it cannot restart again without crashing
[07:08] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: okay, alright, up until now i thought your philosophy was that windows is just inferior even though the card works on windows, that changes everything
[07:08] <Curs0r> MattDaPcWiz, you might try colinux until you feel you have it worked out
[07:08] <MattDaPcWiz> colinux?
[07:09] <Curs0r> MattDaPcWiz, google it
[07:09] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: i think the best solution is still compiling a kernel and installing a debian package with checkinstall. look up compiling a kernel, checkinstall, etc. and if you still need help, i'm more than willing to help :)
[07:09] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: that way you don't have to reinstall any new or old version of ubuntu
[07:09] <mag_> wow mamy people again !}
[07:09] <Curs0r> I'm loving 6.10 I never had such a stable install
[07:10] <nzhomie> there was 900 last nite
[07:10] <nzhomie> cursor i agree !
[07:10] <jakub_> Curs0r: that's kind of ironic compared to what ubuntu seems to publicly state that it's supposed to be a bleeding edge distro, hehe
[07:10] <arrenlex> mag_: This is pretty low for #ubuntu.
[07:11] <mag_> arrenlex: I know, where are you froom ?
[07:11] <sonicGB> anyone know how to pull out a network driver (sky2) and replace it with the older sk98lin ? I'm not sufficiently ubuntu clued to know how to do it, but that might resolve MattDaPcWiz 's issue
[07:11] <arrenlex> mag_: ....why?
[07:11] <sonicGB> the new sky2 driver in 6.10 breaks with marvell yukon
[07:11] <Curs0r> i've got beryl running with video on 3 sides of the cube, all my windows at 90% opaque and running a 3d game and it still doesn't overwork my machine... that's art
[07:12] <mag_> arrenlex: Where are you from ?
[07:12] <mag_> arrenlex: that's my question !
[07:12] <arrenlex> Curs0r: My glxgears runs with 90fps when it's full screen. :D *dance*
[07:12] <ski-worklap> Curs0r, what sort of hardware?
[07:12] <arrenlex> mag_: Why do you ask?
[07:12] <LookTJ> Anyone familer with syslinux?
[07:12] <ski-worklap> arrenlex, how can you tell how man fps your glxgears gets?
[07:12] <Curs0r> x2 3800, 2gb pc-3200, 7800gtx
[07:12] <jakub_> sonicGB: rmmod and modprobe but you need to compile the kernel like i've said over and over
[07:12] <arrenlex> ski-worklap: glxgears -print-fps
[07:12] <miniman> YAYY
[07:12] <mag_> arrenlex: it's only a question !
[07:13] <arrenlex> Sorry, -printfps
[07:13] <arrenlex> ^ ski-worklap
[07:13] <miniman> Can anyone recommend a codec pack for mp3/videos?
[07:13] <MattDaPcWiz> wait
[07:13] <MattDaPcWiz> hold on
[07:13] <MattDaPcWiz> i have a driver from marvell
[07:13] <MattDaPcWiz> but i do not know how to install it
[07:13] <Adlai_> miniman, mplayer
[07:13] <Born_In_Xixax> is it a linux driver?
[07:13] <ski-worklap> arrenlex, it's not printing anything?
[07:13] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: what file format is it? is it .ko?
[07:13] <Adlai_> you don't really need codec packs
[07:13] <ski-worklap> oh wait there it goes
[07:13] <Adlai_> those are windows
[07:14] <miniman> Thank you Adlai_
[07:14] <Geoffrey2> sigh..............
[07:14] <mag_> arrenlex: becasue I'm drinking some beer and Don't I don't have someting that I can do ! lol
[07:14] <sonicGB> jakub_: compiling a kernel is a bit over the top for a n00b.... how about building a module and insmodding it?
[07:14] <MattDaPcWiz> brb lemme check
[07:14] <Adlai_> if anything install win32codecs (or similar ubuntu release)
[07:14] <mag_> :D
[07:14] <MattDaPcWiz> it came packed
[07:14] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Problems? =P
[07:14] <ski-worklap> hmm 40 fps, no beryl  :)
[07:14] <Adlai_> !mp3 | miniman

[07:14] <honda> what does "Could not resolve 'archive.cannonical.com'" mean when i update synaptic?
[07:14] <jakub_> sonicGB: okay, fine if you want to get into the symantics, he has to compile a kernel *module* happy? he still needs to grab the sources doesn't he?
[07:14] <sonicGB> MattDaPcWiz: what's the driver that you have? on a CD or something? or downloaded?
[07:14] <Born_In_Xixax> sonicGB, could he use ndiswrapper with the win drivers for his marvell yukon?
[07:14] <Curs0r> 6225 fps :D
[07:14] <Born_In_Xixax> can you not use ndiswrapper with regular ethernet adapters?
[07:14] <arrenlex> honda: It means that you need to spell "canonical" correctly in /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:15] <arrenlex> Curs0r: With glx-gears fullscreen?
[07:15] <jakub_> sonicGB: and building a .deb out of it is better practice because he'll always have a copy that *worked*
[07:15] <Adlai_> ahh, it's w32codecs here
[07:15] <sonicGB> Born_In_Xixax: maybe, but I don't think that's necessary. There are at least two different drivers for his card for Ubuntu... the one that 6.10 has by default is a bit borken
[07:15] <Curs0r> what's the fullscreen switch?
[07:15] <sonicGB> changing to the other might be enough
[07:15] <sonicGB> I've never tried ndiswrapper... used "project evil" on BSD though, that was a pretty cool bit of kit
[07:15] <Born_In_Xixax> right, but ndiswrapper might be easier :)
[07:16] <jakub_> sonicGB: ndiswrapper is a lot easier to use than ndisgen or ndiscvt on BSD
[07:16] <Curs0r> oh  crap i have no idea how to kill beryl and get the max fps lol
[07:16] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Well, _I_ was just maximising my window... but -fullscreen is a valid switch.
[07:16] <ski-worklap> Curs0r, log off and start a new non-xgl session?
[07:16] <Curs0r> kk brb
[07:16] <userundefine> or just metacity --replace
[07:16] <sonicGB> ignore jakub_
[07:16] <Curs0r> i like that one better
[07:17] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, at this point I'm trying to decide whether I keep fighting Ubuntu, look at another distro, or just throw in the towel on the whole thing
[07:17] <MattDaPcWiz> alright im back and i have the contents of the file from MARVELL
[07:17] <jakub_> sonicGB: what's your problem?
[07:17] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: What's wrong?
[07:17] <sonicGB> cool... let us have it MattDaPcWiz
[07:17] <arrenlex> MattDaPcWiz: I remember that driver... never could get it to compile.
[07:18] <MattDaPcWiz> it contains 4 files, install.sh, sk98lin.4, sk98lin.tar.bz2 and README
[07:18] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: tar jxvf sk98lin.tar.bz2
[07:18] <Born_In_Xixax> check the readme of course :)
[07:18] <Curs0r> arrenlex, 2657.754 FPS with the -fullscreen switch, no beryl
[07:18] <MattDaPcWiz> yeh duhhhhhhh lol
[07:18] <MattDaPcWiz> but it does not help
[07:19] <MattDaPcWiz> i type what it says
[07:19] <sonicGB> how does it not help Matt? what have you tried?
[07:19] <arrenlex> jakub_: For your own knowledge you can just run "tar xf sk98lin.tar.bz2" -- it's more convenient. :)
[07:19] <Born_In_Xixax> is it worth pastbin-ing?
[07:19] <MattDaPcWiz> but it says access denied
[07:19] <jakub_> the install script seems to be from autotools or something.. and the tarball might hold a generic i386 module
[07:19] <miniman> Ahem... I just installed ubuntu last night, so could someone please help me out..I'm not sure as to what MPlayer to download
[07:19] <jakub_> arrenlex: i don't think that's cross platform, better to have good practices for multiplatform use :)
[07:19] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, right now everything is stable...it's a good bet tomorrow evening when I get home I'll have to reboot again.....I COULD just shut down the computer every time I leave it for a while, but then I'm not supposed to have to do that with Linux.....
[07:19] <LookTJ> i'm having trouble creating a Liveusb
[07:19] <jakub_> MattDaPcWiz: you're probably uncompressing it to a directory you don't hae access to
[07:19] <emun> hi everybody, need some help with installing canon pixma m150 multifunction printer on ubuntu 6.10, please I am anovice
[07:19] <sonicGB> Matt: try "sudo what-id-says"
[07:20] <miniman> Ahem... I just installed ubuntu last night, so could someone please help me out..I'm not sure as to what MPlayer to download
[07:20] <arrenlex> jakub_: xjf isn't cross-platform either... on the solaris machines at school I actually have to bunzip first and tar xf the resulting ball.
[07:20] <userundefine> Geoffrey2, why are you having to reboot right now
[07:20] <sonicGB> actually, I'd like to know what's in install.sh MattDaPcWiz
[07:20] <missing> arrenlex
[07:20] <Curs0r> 74477 frames in 5.0 seconds = 14895.305 FPS <-- normal sized no beryl hahahaha
[07:20] <MattDaPcWiz> sigh lol this would be SO MUCH EASIER if i was just on linux
[07:20] <LookTJ> why doesn't the command(syslinux -s /dev/sda1) work?
[07:20] <arrenlex> missing?
[07:20] <missing> arrenlex: you need to get automatix
[07:20] <MattDaPcWiz> the install.sh is huge
[07:21] <jakub_> arrenlex: ah good to know. but does solaris symlink bunzip to bunzip2? or is that another step that must be specified?
[07:21] <sonicGB> Curs0r: I hope you're talking about ethernet and not video!!! LOL
[07:21] <arrenlex> missing: Why?
[07:21] <missing> it will install everything you need for mplayer
[07:21] <arrenlex> Curs0r: What card? xD
[07:21] <missing> so u can play mp3 and dvd

[07:21] <MattDaPcWiz> brb
[07:21] <arrenlex> jakub_: I use the bunzip command... never looked into how it was arranged.
[07:21] <LookTJ> don't use automatix
[07:21] <osah> Hello i need help :(
[07:21] <arrenlex> Curs0r: ...*dumb* that is what company?
[07:21] <arrenlex> missing: I can play mp3 and dvd just fine. o_O I think you mistook me for someone.
[07:22] <Curs0r> Nvidia made the chip, MSI made the card
[07:22] <LookTJ> !automatix | missing
[07:22] <ubotu> missing: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:22] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Ah. Nvidia. That explains it.
[07:22] <osah> I installed ubuntu, how do i access 'root'. It never asked me to supply a password. So what is the root password :/ There are some commands i need root for :/
[07:22] <Born_In_Xixax> !WorksForMe
[07:22] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[07:22] <missing> well i cant in no way agree with you there
[07:22] <arrenlex> Curs0r: I'm running an ATI x300 ... and I have to use the open-source driver for 3D acceleration because fglrx was coded in notepad by a blindfolded intern as part of a hazing process.
[07:22] <arrenlex> !sudo | oash
[07:22] <ubotu> oash: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:22] <Born_In_Xixax> lol
[07:22] <Curs0r> i got hooked on Nvidia about the time of the geforce2
[07:23] <LookTJ> but on to my question
[07:23] <Curs0r> arrenlex, time will tell if AMD can save ATI
[07:23] <arrenlex> Curs0r: My old machine had a geforce 2... I miss those days. When 3D worked. Good days.
[07:23] <missing> automatix has become a time saver and it does the same thing i would do myself like add repos and install software
[07:23] <LookTJ> when i do syslinux -s /dev/sda1
[07:23] <osah> can anyone use sudo then?
[07:23] <osah> or just my general account "osah"
[07:23] <LookTJ> it says command not found
[07:23] <Geoffrey2> userundefine, well, after the computer sits running for a period of time, I'll find that I can't get ANYTHING to load....I also won't be able to shut down normally....at least arrenlex showed me the RSEIUB shutdown method, so I don't have to just hit the power button anymore :)
[07:23] <arrenlex> missing: a) why are you telling me? and b) we don't recommend automatix here.
[07:24] <osah> can i do,  sudo passwd
[07:24] <missing> thats fine
[07:24] <osah> and add a root pw?
[07:24] <Madpilot> os390, you could, but why?
[07:24] <arrenlex> oash: You can make a root account by using "sudo passwd root". However, it's recommended to just use sudo for all commands you need to run as root.
[07:24] <Curs0r> osah better probably to do sudo /bin/bash then run passwd then exit
[07:24] <Madpilot> osah, and by default, only the first account created will have sudo
[07:25] <arrenlex> Curs0r: "sudo -i" is what you're looking for.
[07:25] <Curs0r> arrenlex, i never read the manual ;)
[07:25] <osah> thx guys :D
[07:25] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Me neither. I just hang around here and watch everyone retrain the newbies.
[07:25] <Curs0r> kinda why i'm here rofl
[07:26] <emun> need help with printer installation, any suggestions , for canon mp150
[07:26] <arrenlex> Curs0r: It's kind of hypocritical of me because I always make a root account and use su, myself, whenever I have more than one command in a row to run. But oh well. xD
[07:26] <missing> hell im the wrong network no wonder
[07:26] <Curs0r> i'm happy as a pig in s&%t with the way my system is running, i just want to help where i can and learn tricks
[07:27] <Adlai_> Curs0r, just hang out in the channel and watch people get questions answered
[07:27] <arrenlex> Curs0r: I was that way once. Then I ran apt-get upgrade one day and nothing was the same again.
[07:27] <Adlai_> I did that for a month in #gentoo and learned almost everything I know
[07:28] <Curs0r> i used to hang in #gentoo but i got bored with the achingly long builds
[07:28] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Indeed. Life is too short to run gentoo.
[07:28] <osah> Hey guys how come when i try to play a 3D game on ubuntu its lagging. I installed nvidia-drivers for it using  apt-get and i rebooted.
[07:28] <Curs0r> I like its performance but i never got this kind of stability
[07:28] <osah> how can view which driver i got installed
[07:28] <Curs0r> osah, what's your gpu?
[07:29] <MattDaPcWiz> ok one thing just ONE THING, i just need to know how to log in as root, what is the password for root?
[07:29] <sonicGB> there isn't one Matt...
[07:29] <osah> cpu is  Amd 2100,  1.7ghz,  1gig ram,  nvidia gforce 4.  on windows all games run smooth. (im trying to run dreamchess) a .deb game
[07:29] <sonicGB> use sudo
[07:29] <Madpilot> MattDaPcWiz, there isn't one by default
[07:29] <sonicGB> so "sudo <comman>"
[07:29] <Madpilot> ubotu, sudo | MattDaPcWiz
[07:29] <ubotu> MattDaPcWiz: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:29] <sonicGB> and it will ask for password
[07:29] <MattDaPcWiz> but i typed in nothing
[07:29] <MattDaPcWiz> and it said incorrect password
[07:30] <Madpilot> MattDaPcWiz, sudo uses the user pw you gave during install... see the URL the bot gave you
[07:30] <MattDaPcWiz> kk
[07:30] <Curs0r> osah, did you use the standard driver or the beta from... what's the repo... albertonline?
[07:30] <sonicGB> Matt: when I say there isn't one, I don't mean it's blank... I mean ... it's well, who knows
[07:30] <sonicGB> but you don't need it.
[07:30] <sonicGB> sudo runs any command as root, and it asks for your own password
[07:30] <osah> Curs0r, i used, sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[07:31] <Curs0r> osah, but you didn't add any repos first right?
[07:31] <osah> yup i didnt add anything
[07:31] <Curs0r> ok
[07:31] <osah> just found that command from forum
[07:31] <wabbit> Hi all !! I'm trying to install Xgl/Compix but find that the gnome-window-decorator command is missing. Have I missed something??
[07:31] <Curs0r> ubuntuguid.org has the info for installing the nvidia beta driver
[07:31] <arrenlex> osah: What's the output of "glxinfo | grep ender"?
[07:31] <Curs0r> ubuntuguide.org*
[07:31] <sonicGB> hmmm, it's really beginning to look like all this published ubuntu philosophy of helping, not giving people grief, etc, etc is honoured more in the breach than in actual practice!
=== Geoffrey3 is now known as Geoffrey2
[07:32] <osah> glxinfo | grep ender
[07:32] <doomed>  /server irc.hydrochat.net
[07:32] <Madpilot> sonicGB, how so?
[07:32] <osah> returned   direct rendering: no ,  opengl renderer string: MESA GLX Indirect
[07:33] <Geoffrey2> sigh...I say again, sigh.... :)
[07:33] <arrenlex> osah: That's why your game is lagging. =P You're not using the 3D driver.
[07:33] <osah> do you have any link, or command which would enable it
[07:33] <arrenlex> osah: What's the output of "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep iver | grep nv"?
[07:33] <sonicGB> Madpilot: I've just seen a couple of newbies get some very average advice today (as in unhelpful) and then they've wandered off frustrated and probably more lost than when they came in
[07:34] <osah> its     Driver  "nv"
[07:34] <Curs0r> osah, eureka
[07:34] <arrenlex> osah: That's your problem.
[07:34] <osah> how would i change it? :/
[07:34] <Madpilot> sonicGB, there's always a few, yeah - but most people get help, assuming they're willing to help themelves...
[07:34] <arrenlex> osah: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:34] <osah> i've been a Windows user for 8 years. Just got ubuntu today, i love it.
[07:34] <sonicGB> Madpilot: yeah, there is that! :-)
[07:35] <arrenlex> osah: Choose "nvidia"
[07:35] <arrenlex> osah: If "nvidia" is not available, you do not have that driver installed yet. You need to install it.
[07:35] <LookTJ> grr i can't install the syslinux bootloader
[07:35] <LookTJ> taylor@dapper:~$ syslinux /dev/sda1
[07:35] <LookTJ> sh: mcopy: command not found
[07:35] <LookTJ> syslinux: failed to create ldlinux.sys
[07:36] <LookTJ> Please help if you could
[07:36] <osah> nvidia is not available,  but   nv  is?
[07:36] <osah> would that be it
[07:36] <Curs0r> osah,  i installed windows vista and 2 hours later deleted all win32 code from my pc
[07:36] <arrenlex> sonicGB: It's just that people don't know how to help with some things, especially very specific things. But if we just ignore people they start yelling at us. It's hard to find a middle ground, so people give "advice" to make askers feel like they've not been shafted, but at the same time not very useful advice because they don't know much about it.
[07:36] <CoRnJuLiOx> hey, has anyone here tried out the flash player 9 beta?
[07:36] <emun> newbie here who is not getting nothing about how to install printer  canon pixma mp150
[07:36] <arrenlex> osah: You need to install it then. Press ctrl+c to exist that configuration utility; you don't need it right now.
[07:36] <arrenlex> osah: Follow this guide:

[07:38] <miniman> omg
[07:38] <miniman> I fucked ubuntu up D:
[07:38] <sonicGB> emun: mp150... is that a printer or a multifunction?
[07:38] <Geoffrey2> if I wanted to totally disable my wireless device so ubuntu wouldn't even look at it, what's the best way to do that...keeping in mind I might want to re-enable it down the road....
[07:38] <miniman> automatix2 fucked up my ubuntu :(
[07:38] <sonicGB> Geoffrey2: it it's a laptop, you can disable the hardware in bios?
[07:38] <arrenlex> sonicGB: For example, I don't use Gnome or synaptic, so when people ask how to, for example, configure the sound or add repositories, the only way in which I could help them would be to give them command line instructions, which are confusing and unnecessary since there's a GUI way to do it. So I stay quiet a lot of times because I don't want my help to hurt them. I imagine a lot of people have come up with weird ways to do what they want 
[07:38] <sonicGB> if it's a dell laptop, you press function-f2 to turn the device on/off!

[07:39] <sonicGB> arrenlex: I know what you're saying. I just you just have to work on that sixth sense, figureing out what advice is right for what people, and sticking to answering the ones you can!
[07:40] <emun> sonicgb. it is a multifunction, scanner/printer/ copier
[07:40] <sonicGB> I don't see how trying to convince someone to go back to windows because his network card works there is 'helping' though!
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[07:40] <sonicGB> emun: I'm digging for info, but multifunction is what I was afraid of. Those things can be tricky...
[07:41] <Curs0r> sonicGB, I see our point, that's not exactly "ubuntu help" is it?
[07:41] <Curs0r> your*
[07:41] <arrenlex> sonicGB: I had that network card, and I resorted to unscrewing my old box and stealing one of the NICs from there just so I could have internet. What kind of advice is that? xD
=== kuto|away is now known as kuto
[07:42] <sonicGB> emun: the first advice I'm gonna give is think outside the square. in a lot of cases with printers in particular, a driver from a similar model printer will often work... so keep an eye out for solutions for other similar machines.... I'm googling at the moment....
[07:42] <emun> sonicgb thanks for trying I hope yiu can find something for me
[07:42] <Varanger> hello
[07:42] <Varanger> how can I take a snapshot of my X desktop from the console??
[07:42] <Curs0r> i only have 1 hardware issue with ubuntu, all linux really and it's kinda dumb... my backlighted keyboard uses the scroll lock key for the switch
[07:44] <sonicGB> emun: I'm finding two year old info that says your printer isn't supported with linux. That might be out of date info, but it looks like turboprint (USD$39.00 IIRC) might support it...
[07:44] <thesand> Can someone please post the link for the binarydriverhowto again? (installing ATI driver)
[07:44] <osah> Curs0r, i did follow all the steps but i return "unable to load nvidia kernel driver~ BNe sure to have installted the nvidia driver for your running kenrle,:

[07:44] <thesand> Thanks!!
[07:44] <Born_In_Xixax> emun: 2 minutes on google, turned up a forum post indicating Canon does not have linux support for the mp150 and does not plan to, as well as a link to http://www.turboprint.info/ where apparently you can buy a 3rd party driver for 39 dollars
[07:45] <osah> Jordan_U, yup thats what i followed. Didnt help :( hmh not sure what im doing wrong
[07:45] <Curs0r> osah, run lsmod | grep -i nvidia

[07:46] <wabbit> hey thanks
[07:46] <Curs0r> osah no worries, you're almost there
[07:46] <Capslock118> for anyone who knows cedega, why wont it install a game?
[07:47] <Curs0r> osah, what that means is that the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf still points to the driver "nv" instead of "nvidia"
[07:47] <emun> sonicgb, actually hsd the printer before I decided to install ubuntu, used it in windows
[07:48] <sonicGB> emun: ah, sorry... I think you said you only got ubuntu today, right? :-)
[07:48] <Curs0r> osah, you can edit that file manually or try the interface switcher again
[07:48] <osah> Curs0r, in config now i see nvidia
[07:48] <Curs0r> osah, awesome!
[07:48] <osah> now its asking me for
[07:48] <osah> PCI BUS number..  lspci  doesnt show me any,
[07:49] <Curs0r> how bout lspci -v
[07:49] <emun> born in xixax, is the no other way to get the printer to apart from having to dole out $39
[07:49] <sonicGB> emun: do you realise that you'll effectively be treating this mp150 as a bunch of kljlknlk;n (cat typing!) seperate devices (scanner, printer, etc) and that you'll be instlaling them seperately?
[07:49] <osah> it shows umm  01:00.0
[07:49] <sonicGB> hyyyyyyyyyu6667
[07:49] <sonicGB> oops, cat typing
[07:49] <Born_In_Xixax> emun, that's just what i found in 2 min on google, but it doesn't sound promising
[07:49] <osah> so would the bus be  PCI:01:00.0
[07:50] <Varanger> how can I take a snapshot of my X desktop from the console??
[07:50] <osah> or PCI:01:00:0 .. ?
[07:50] <sonicGB> emun: for the printing part, this might be useful ( a bit of a messy install, no point/click sorry)   http://mambo.kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~takushi/#canon
[07:50] <Jordan_U> Varanger: gnome-screenshot
[07:50] <Curs0r> osah, I unfortunately have not used that utility before, I usually edit my configs manually
[07:51] <sonicGB> enum: that page has some info about support for a few other mpXXX printers, so you MIGHT get lucky and get the mp150 printing for free that way
[07:51] <Curs0r> arrenlex, you still there?
[07:51] <emun> actually if I can get the pirinter to work I will be happy
[07:51] <sonicGB> emun: if you go down the turboprint route, try the demo download first, to make sure it works before you pay!

=== [1] wenko is now known as wenko
[07:53] <emun> ok I will take a look at turboprint, by the way are there  any printers that work with ubuntu without a hassle
[07:54] <Born_In_Xixax> I understand HP printers have good linux support
[07:54] <Curs0r> osah, i know it will work if you escape that utility and nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf, scroll down to the Device section, and change the driver from "nv" to "nvidia". I'm sure there are plenty of ways but that is just muscle memory to me
[07:54] <sonicGB> emun: scanning support is coming soon, looks like.... http://pixma.schewe.com/
[07:54] <arrenlex> osah: This might be a little too late, but you don't need to put a PCI bus.
[07:54] <arrenlex> osah: That is an "advanced" field.
[07:55] <Curs0r> arrenlex, ah, there you are... I was fumbling hehehe
[07:55] <sonicGB> emun: I use a samsung ML-1610... it's a little laser with usb... costs about AUD$180.00... I'm happy withh it
[07:55] <sonicGB> the samsungs work well with winders and linux, but so far I haven't got it working with mac
[07:55] <emun> thank you so much for the info
[07:56] <arrenlex> Born_In_Xixax: HP has fantastic support for Linux. The hplip package provides support for faxing, printing and scanning (and by extension, all-in-ones) while the hpiijs package is for inkjet printers only, but either way it's definitely well-supported.
[07:56] <sonicGB> emun: but like I was saying about looking for drivers for other similar machines, the samsung is a good example. I'm using the Samsung ML-1700 driver to run my ML-1610 printer!
[07:56] <sonicGB> emun: you're welcome. I hope it's of some help!
[07:56] <sorush20> how do I check what my default java is ?
[07:57] <arrenlex> emun: I am using a ppd file that I almost accidentally found on the internet to run my Lexmark laser printer -- they only provide drivers for RedHat, as if anyone still uses it.

[07:58] <arrenlex> osah: You've restarted X, right?
[07:58] <osah> not yet
[07:58] <sonicGB> emun: the hard part was getting my head around CUPS... it's a bit wierd (but I needed it set up as a network printer that some winders machines could access)....
[07:58] <arrenlex> osah: XD.
[07:58] <osah> do i reboot whole pc
[07:58] <osah> ?
[07:59] <Born_In_Xixax> osah: log out, then back in
[07:59] <osah> or just logoff username and log back in
[07:59] <arrenlex> osah: You don't need to. Just issue "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
[07:59] <osah> oh ok
[07:59] <Born_In_Xixax> fancy!
[07:59] <arrenlex> ...actually, that might not restart X itself, in hindsight.
[08:00] <Curs0r> arrenlex, you forgot ctrl+alt+bksp
[08:00] <Curs0r> at gdm
[08:00] <sonicGB> emun: a lot of the little printers are more difficult 'cos they're built for winders and they rely on windows drivers to do a lot of the printing work... when you move them to another OS, nothing works. A slightly bigger printer that has its own 'brains' is a lot easier to connect to a non-windows OS, because things like HP-PCL and Postcript  are supported by everything. For example, way back in windows 3.1 days, ANY postscript printer w
[08:00] <arrenlex> Curs0r: ctrl+alt+bksp is a hard restart of the X server you can issue anywhere.
[08:00] <emun> actualy my mp150 was set up with windows on a network with a netgear print server
[08:00] <arrenlex> sonicGB: You got a little wordy and were cut off at "ANY postscript printer".
[08:00] <Curs0r> arrenlex, in my experience it's best not to do it logged in... well i haven't tried that in a long time...
[08:01] <sonicGB> emun: the easiest way out of the printing problem is to look for a non-windows printer, something that speaks a standard language like postscript or PC.... look at the side of the box.. if it says "Requires windows" then you're prolly going to have grief with it!
[08:01] <arrenlex> Curs0r: In the sense that it kills everything you have open, yeah. In the sense that it's somehow bad for your system no.
[08:01] <sonicGB> all but the smallest HP printers fit in that category.
[08:01] <sonicGB> inkjets are almost universially difficult
[08:02] <osah> ok im back
[08:02] <arrenlex> emun: The easiest way out of the printing problem is to actually look at linuxprinting.org before you start.
[08:02] <arrenlex> osah: Hiya.
[08:02] <sonicGB> brb, coffee
[08:02] <osah> i would like to thank you Curs0r  and you arrenlex  :) good job it works fine.
[08:02] <osah> :D
[08:02] <arrenlex> osah: Hurrah!
[08:02] <saturnine_fei> guess not...
[08:02] <Curs0r> osah, good to hear
[08:02] <sonicGB> arrenlex: in this case he got the printer before he got linux!
[08:02] <osah> do you recommend any website learning some basics like i have no clue what grep does... :)
[08:02] <emun> I see I am learning a lot , what is this postscript
[08:02] <osah> its my first time on linux.. been on windows since win95
[08:03] <arrenlex> sonicGB: I'm aware of that. We were in the hypothetical situation of "how to avoid the printing problem" and I pitched in for future reference.
[08:03] <arrenlex> osah: I've been on Windows since 3.1 =O
[08:03] <Curs0r> osah, hang out for a while, learn how the utilities are used by watching others
[08:03] <osah> i was wondering, when i run an application from console for example  "xchat" if i close console xchat closes. I know there is a command to make it run but i still can type other commands in console..
[08:03] <sonicGB> emun: postscript is a language, closely related to PDF in some ways actually, that was one of the first widely used printing languages. It's  a 'page description' language.. "put this text here" draw a circle that big over there, etc, etc...
[08:03] <Curs0r> arrenlex, sysedit was oh-so-useful wasn't it?
[08:04] <sonicGB> a lot of printers support it....
[08:04] <arrenlex> Curs0r: I don't know. o_o I was 8.
[08:04] <arrenlex> Curs0r: I didn't mess with the internals at that age.
[08:04] <Lunis> i'm trying to sync my sony clie to ubuntu edgy via gnome-pilot. i am running the "wizard" for gnome-pilot, and it asks for information and i fill it out, it says it will send owner data, and to press the hotsync button. I do that, and two gnome-pilot windows pop up on top, but none of them seem to detect the device. I'm using /proc/bus/usb/devices as the path to my cradle (usb). am i doing this right?
[08:04] <Tefad> Starcraftmazter: you might also want to poke in #ubuntu-server
[08:04] <Curs0r> arrenlex, haha
[08:04] <sonicGB> the same with PCL... I think PCL came from HP (ie: HP-PCL, PCL5, PCL6)... but a LOT of other printers also run a clone of that language...
[08:04] <Adlai_> osah, your window manager probably has a "run command..." function, but if you want to do it from command prompt, type in "xchat &"
[08:04] <saturnine_fei> this forum was suggested for help with ubuntu.  how does one get a question answered?
[08:04] <Born_In_Xixax> osah: you may find it nice to use 'Alt+F2' to open a 'run' command window and issue it there
[08:04] <osah> yup that was it  & sign :D
[08:04] <Curs0r> arrenlex, i had a trash-80 at that age
[08:05] <osah> :o thxs Born_In_Xixax
[08:05] <arrenlex> osah: "grep" prints the lines from a file that match a string you give it. Like, if you have a file with the lines "one","two", and "three" in it (those words on separate lines), then if you grep that file with "one" you will get one. If you grep that file with "t" you will get two and three. Understand? It filters by pattern.
[08:05] <sonicGB> emun: in either case, theprint drivers just make a big file with all the 'page description' stuff in it, and throw it at the printer via usb, paralle, ethernetc, whatever... and the printer figures it out!
[08:05] <arrenlex> osah: I just had you take your entire X config file and only print the lines that contained "nv".
[08:05] <Random_Transit> hey, this is gonna sound like an odd question, but is ubotu (the channel bot) open source??
[08:05] <osah> arrenlex, oh ic :)
[08:05] <Curs0r> osah you can always use the info tools as well if you have a question about the usage of a program
[08:05] <emun> it looks like it was some proprietary language, why dont all printers use the same language
[08:05] <Curs0r> osah, ie"info grep"
[08:06] <osah> do you guys recommend any  mp3 player that runs from console.. if any
[08:06] <sonicGB> emun: the difference between that approach and the smaller 'GDI' printers (aka "Windows Printers") is that they rely on the operating system to do almost all of the processing, and that makes it really difficult to move them to a different OS
[08:06] <arrenlex> emun: Trade secrets. Capitalism. Patenting.
[08:06] <sonicGB> arrenlex: re future info... no worries... I wasn't having a go at you :-)
[08:06] <arrenlex> osah: mplayer! ^__^
[08:06] <Born_In_Xixax> osah: mplayer runs from the console
[08:06] <Curs0r> osah, mplayer is uber1337
[08:06] <arrenlex> osah: Also, mplayer plays anything. Literally, like, I've yet to find ANY FILE mplayer can't play.
[08:07] <arrenlex> mplayerismygod.
[08:07] <osah> i was wondering there is this command " deb http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/debian" for example. if i type that in console it returns deb unknown command.
[08:07] <emun> thanks for the explanation , I am really impressed with this forum
[08:07] <Curs0r> osah, mplayer is also the media layer of choice for the xbox media center softmod lol
[08:07] <arrenlex> osah: What are you trying to do?
[08:07] <sonicGB> arrenlex: "cat /dev/random | mplayer" ?? :-) :-) :-)
[08:07] <michaeljustman> I was wondering if anyone here has had any experience with the ATI Radeon Xpress 200M video adapter and getting it to work with 3D exceleration?
[08:07] <osah> arrenlex just trying to download a package
[08:07] <sonicGB> u welcome enum
[08:07] <osah> alot of websites have it listed like that
[08:08] <saturnine_fei> i guess one doesn't if they aren't already known to the in-crowd ...  So much for ubuntu's friendly helpful community reputation...
[08:08] <osah> it says to add it to  /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:08] <sonicGB> saturnine_fei: there's no in-crowd that.... blast, he left
[08:08] <sonicGB> *sigh*
[08:08] <osah> and the package would install :/
[08:08] <Random_Transit> lol
[08:08] <arrenlex> osah: That's right. Open /etc/apt/sources.list in an editor and add that line to it. Then you can grab the package with apt-get.
[08:08] <osah> ooh ic
[08:08] <arrenlex> osah: Those lines are like addresses for apt. They tell it where on the internet to look for packages.
[08:09] <arrenlex> osah: If you have a .deb file sitting on your hard drive that you want to install, you use sudo dpkg -i <file.deb>
[08:09] <Random_Transit> so can anyone answer my rather unorthodox question?
[08:09] <arrenlex> osah: That translates into commands as "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list", paste that line, save, close, "sudo apt-get update", and then "sudo apt-get install <packageyouwant>"
[08:09] <sonicGB> Random_Transit: what's the question? I missed it.
[08:09] <Random_Transit> is ubotu (the channel bot) open source??
[08:10] <sonicGB> LOL
[08:10] <emun> is there a place where I can learn how to use CUPS
[08:10] <Random_Transit> told you it was an odd question
[08:10] <strabes> Random_Transit: yeah that is really random. i suspect you could get the code for it somewhere
[08:10] <strabes> ask one of the mods maybe
[08:10] <sonicGB> emun: a nice place to start with CUPS is to find a brick wall and slam your head on it a few times <GRIN> :-) it's a strange bit of code, a bit tricky.... wait...
[08:11] <Born_In_Xixax> i imagine there a jillion open source irc bots
[08:11] <Random_Transit> strabes...if only the mods were here somewhere
[08:11] <arrenlex> Random_Transit: They're all in #ubuntu-ops
[08:11] <emun> WOW are you serious is it that bad
[08:11] <gotit> jillion?? how many zeros in it
[08:11] <Random_Transit> oh yeah...
[08:11] <strabes> Random_Transit: you can call them with !mods i think but people seem to get upset
[08:11] <strabes> or !ops i mean
[08:11] <strabes> i dont remember
[08:11] <arrenlex> strabes: Please don't use !ops unless someone is abusing the channel.
[08:11] <sonicGB> emun: I'm exagerrating. Actually, it's really pretty good... it's just that the config files are a bit 'different'. :-)
[08:11] <strabes> arrenlex: yeah see that's what i thought
[08:12] <sonicGB> emun: http://www.cups.org/cups-help.html  <--- that's the official site
[08:12] <michaeljustman> does anyone know where to download the old ATI drivers (8.24.8 hopefull) precompiled?  I can't seem to compile them and my graphics card hates the newest ones.
[08:12] <Random_Transit> and i guess me just waltzing into the ops channel and asking for ubotu's code would be really odd
[08:12] <MatthewV> Random_Transit, you are looking for a blootbot
[08:12] <arrenlex> sonicGB: Isn't there some graphical utility to configure printing? KDE has kprinter so I've never even had to touch cups itself after apt-get install cupsys... everything was handled by a fantastic GUI.
[08:12] <tonyyarusso> Random_Transit: Meanwhile, ubotu is a supybot; the supybot base code is in the repos, and the entire code for ubotu itself is also available.
[08:12] <Madpilot> Random_Transit, the bot is GPL'd, the bot has a URL for it's own code available...
[08:12] <Madpilot> !bot
[08:12] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[08:12] <osah> is ubuntu 6.10  Edgy?
[08:13] <Madpilot> osah, no - 6.10 is Feist; 6.06 is Edgy
[08:13] <Curs0r> i'd say it's fairly well mannered lol
[08:13] <sonicGB> arrenlex: ah, yes... emun, I should add that I'm absolutely no expert on anything GUI-related on linux/unix... I use them as servers, I do it all on command line...
[08:13] <arrenlex> Random_Transit: naw, they're pretty good. It depends on who's there. I've asked them some stuff several times and they're really nice... it depends on who's there.
[08:13] <MatthewV> Random_Transit, sry, old ubotu was a blootbot, tonyyarusso is correct on the new ubotu
[08:13] <Curs0r> Madpilot, ummm, you sure about that?
[08:13] <tonyyarusso> Madpilot: Um....you're wrong....
[08:13] <sonicGB> arrenlex: actually, once installed, CUPS is all web based.
[08:13] <arrenlex> Random_Transit: People like tonyyaruso and madpilot are fantastic... others are total jerks.
[08:13] <arrenlex> ...
[08:13] <arrenlex> Hi tony. xD
[08:13] <tonyyarusso> Hi arrenlex :)
[08:13] <Born_In_Xixax> 6.10 = Edgy EFT
[08:14] <Madpilot> tonyyarusso, gah, sorry. Is late here, can you tell?
[08:14] <tonyyarusso> Madpilot: You're three hours behind me!
[08:14] <tonyyarusso> ;)
[08:14] <Madpilot> tonyyarusso, maybe, but I've been up since 0600
[08:14] <XYZmale_SMG> mesra.dak.net
[08:14] <sonicGB> what's with all the names for distros anyway? that's the one thing that REALLY confuses me about *ubuntu... I can never figure out the names... I know what 5.xx, 6.04, 6.10 means though! :-)
[08:14] <SilentDis> !beryl
[08:14] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[08:15] <refus3d> beryl rocks!!!
[08:15] <refus3d> i got it up and running
[08:15] <arrenlex> I had beryl. But it crashed a lot.
[08:15] <refus3d> arrenlex, i can see how that might be a problem it is a still a beta
[08:15] <Curs0r> arrenlex, it crashed constantly on FC6 for me, on Edgy, it's solid as a rock
[08:15] <emun> i will check out the cups official site, thanks again , another question . what commands do you use when you download something and you have to compile it
[08:16] <refus3d> ive had some minor problems so far but its cool enuff to keep it around
[08:16] <sonicGB> brb... coffee...
[08:16] <arrenlex> !compile | emun
[08:16] <ubotu> emun: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[08:17] <todger> hi there what is the biggest file i can make with ubuntu?
[08:17] <arrenlex> todger: ...what do you mean?
[08:17] <arrenlex> todger: For kicks? As big as your hard drive. o_O
[08:19] <Curs0r> has anyone established a method to use multiple wallpapers with beryl?
[08:20] <proqesi`> todger: that's a kernel question, not an ubuntu question
[08:20] <emun> thanks again,
[08:20] <todger> well you guys don't seem to no
[08:20] <Curs0r> todger, you were told already
[08:20] <Pablo> how can I make a command like "sudo pppd call 1xevdo" not leave an open terminal when executed
[08:20] <Curs0r> arrenlex> todger: For kicks? As big as your hard drive. o_O
[08:21] <raknam> i've been looking into installing ubuntu, suse or gentoo and i was wondering why you guys would recommend ubuntu over those other two
[08:22] <Random_Transit> raknam...ease of use
[08:22] <Random_Transit> ease of installation
[08:22] <Curs0r> raknam, much greater stability with my system than gentoo or suse
[08:22] <Random_Transit> gentoo is a bitch if you don't have a decent processor
[08:22] <Random_Transit> you'll spend weeks compiling KDE
[08:22] <ski-worklap> but gentoo lets you optimize everything!!!!
[08:22] <ski-worklap> so after you spend 3 months compiling, everything goes 0.02% faster
[08:23] <ski-worklap> ... if it's not io bound
[08:23] <Random_Transit> hahaha
[08:23] <Curs0r> ski-worklap, yes it does, which is great if you know everything about everything
[08:23] <ski-worklap> Curs0r, and have the time to drop
[08:23] <Random_Transit> gentoo is a pain in the ass
[08:23] <Random_Transit> SuSE is nice, but still based on DeadHat
[08:23] <Curs0r> and a time thief
[08:24] <proqesi`> todger: it's as many bytes as you can index with an off_t
[08:24] <Random_Transit> and, in using the RPM system, dependancy hell is still a problem
[08:24] <Curs0r> ubuntu is small and smooth
[08:24] <Random_Transit> yep
[08:24] <sonicGB> this seems like an appropriate time to mention the "Gentoo is for Rice Boys" page! :-)
[08:24] <refus3d> what do you think of my desktop
[08:24] <Curs0r> and extremely well documented
[08:24] <arrenlex> todger: if you were serious about that question, it's 2 Terabytes.
[08:24] <refus3d> http://img304.imageshack.us/my.php?image=8381yg6.png
[08:24] <Random_Transit> SuSE is great, but a bit bloated
[08:25] <Random_Transit> Ubuntu is insanely secure
[08:25] <nzhomie> could someone please help me . there is no wpa_supplicant.conf in the /etc/ folder
[08:25] <arrenlex> AAAAH! Linux vista!! AAAAH
[08:25] <Random_Transit> rofl
[08:25] <Random_Transit> too true
[08:25] <proqesi`> ewww bad UI
[08:25] <refus3d> much better than lista
[08:25] <refus3d> vista
[08:25] <refus3d> there is only one thing that is like vista
[08:26] <refus3d> the buttons...
[08:26] <edog^^^> what params should I give fchk after my comp dies because of a power outage?
[08:26] <administrator> what the fuck is this?
[08:26] <ski-worklap> "ubuntu is insanely secure" got any facts to back that up?
[08:26] <arrenlex> !language | administrator
[08:26] <sonicGB> refus3d: not true. My cat's litter tray is a lot like Vista!
[08:26] <ubotu> administrator: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:26] <Curs0r> refus3d, i think i'll draw my own buttons and save the $400 thank you
[08:26] <Random_Transit> in my time using ubuntu, i've seen ONE security issue pop up, and it was fixed in a matter of minutes
[08:26] <administrator> sorry
[08:26] <administrator> I am brand new to a linux chat room
[08:26] <arrenlex> Random_Transit: If you want real security, use FreeBSD or OpenBSD.
[08:26] <ski-worklap> arrenlex, you mean use openbsd
[08:26] <administrator> and this just took me strait into it.
[08:27] <arrenlex> BSD:Linux::Linux:Windows
[08:27] <ski-worklap> freebsd has gone waaaay downhill from 4.x
[08:27] <arrenlex> ski-worklap: I wouldn't know. I don't BSD.
[08:27] <Random_Transit> arrenlex, sure, but they're a pain to set up
[08:27] <refus3d> Curs0r, i didnt't exzactly spend 400 dollars on a beryl theme
[08:27] <administrator> I am using mepis
[08:27] <sonicGB> <slashdot>FreeBSD is dying!!!</>
[08:27] <arrenlex> xD
[08:27] <nzhomie> could someone please help me . there is no wpa_supplicant.conf in the /etc/ folde
[08:27] <arrenlex> <3 Slashdot.
[08:27] <Curs0r> refus3d, haha i thought you were speaking of windows
[08:27] <Random_Transit> FreeBSD is DEAD!! LONG LIVE OSX!!!
[08:27] <sonicGB> I converted my last FreeBSD box to gentoo about a year ago...
[08:28] <arrenlex> administrator: Okay, what's your question?
[08:28] <strabes> yeah i heard freebsd is kinda suk now
[08:28] <administrator> not sure
[08:28] <sonicGB> actually, no I think I still have one somewhere... a massive 60MHz Pentium 1....
[08:28] <arrenlex> ...
[08:28] <refus3d> i heard bsd kind of sucks
[08:28] <ski-worklap> openbsd is great
[08:28] <ski-worklap> netbsd is interesting
[08:28] <Random_Transit> refus3d, it used to be great
[08:28] <ski-worklap> freebsd was nice
[08:28] <sonicGB> I heard that people who say BSD sucks suck!
[08:28] <nzhomie> could someone please help me . there is no wpa_supplicant.conf in the /etc/ folder
[08:29] <ski-worklap> nzhomie, we heard you the first time, we dunno
[08:29] <proqesi`> I heard this is offtopic!
[08:29] <sonicGB> I really like FreeBSD. I still have a holey old FreeBSD t-shirt here somewhere, as evidence of my allegiance!
[08:29] <ski-worklap> be patient, someone will come around who does know
[08:29] <Random_Transit> nzhomie, what are you trying to do?
[08:29] <administrator> I have a great question for all of you smart people in here
[08:29] <Random_Transit> oh?
[08:29] <arrenlex> administrator: It's true. e does, in fact, equal mc^2.
[08:29] <nzhomie> its just i got no respone so i was like ok maybe they didn't see
[08:29] <arrenlex> I asked it.
[08:29] <Random_Transit> please share with the rest of the class, administrator
[08:29] <Curs0r> there are smart people in here? ^-^
[08:29] <sonicGB> it's been my universal experience that people on usenet who call themselves "administrator" are trouble! :-) Does that cross over to irc I wonder?
[08:29] <ski-worklap> Curs0r, yes, you and only you
[08:30] <nzhomie> i need to configure wpa supplicant and there is no .conf file in the etc folder and i just installed it. am i looking in the right place
[08:30] <Curs0r> ski-worklap, i would never make any such claim
[08:30] <Random_Transit> nzhomie, i would think so...possibly stuffed in a subfolder of etc
[08:30] <nzhomie> ok cheers
[08:31] <administrator> who claims to be the god of knowledge?
[08:31] <sonicGB> http://darnfineshirts.com/out.php?u=iseestupidpeople
[08:31] <arrenlex> administrator: ubotu is the god of knowledge.
[08:32] <Curs0r> love those darling little bots
[08:32] <Random_Transit> administrator, the ancient greeks claimed it was Prometheus
[08:32] <arrenlex> nzhomie: I googled for "ubuntu wpa_supplicant.conf missing" and got http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-78983.html as a result... the very last post in particular seems helpful. Does that help you?
[08:32] <Random_Transit> arrenlex, i think nzhomie went afk
[08:32] <administrator> I have some news for you
[08:32] <arrenlex> Ah.
[08:32] <nzhomie> nam im still here
[08:33] <Gizmo1> Anyone know how to set up dual monitors?
[08:33] <administrator> I AM THE GOD OF KNOWLEDGE
[08:33] <nzhomie> will look at the link now
[08:33] <yakumo> is it possible to use gaim messenger with webcam capability???
[08:33] <Curs0r> ow my freakin ears
[08:33] <arrenlex> yakumo: No.
[08:33] <nzhomie> gizmol, obviously you will need a video card with 2 outputs
[08:33] <Random_Transit> that's nice administrator....
[08:33] <administrator> hhhhhhhhhhhh
[08:33] <arrenlex> yakumo: If you're thinking of MSN specifically, amsn supports voice and video chat.
[08:33] <administrator> you like that?
[08:33] <nzhomie> yakumo, get aMSN it has webcam
[08:33] <Gizmo1> I have 2 cards (identical)
[08:33] <FirstStrike> Yea, I use amsn..works quite nicely.
[08:34] <FirstStrike> Even lets you save the webcam sessions for later viewing
[08:34] <Curs0r> was that a very long exhale? or did your cat step on your keyboard?
[08:34] <refus3d> http://img288.imageshack.us/my.php?image=beryl1wv8.png
[08:34] <arrenlex> FirstStrike: What happens if you press shift+backspace in amsn?
[08:34] <sonicGB> yakumo: I second what arrenlex says re aMSN... it's really very good. Strangely, the windows port is a bit wierd looking, but I'm using the mac one here, and ... it's good
[08:34] <yakumo> <nzhomie> how about the yahoo messenger
[08:34] <FirstStrike> Nothing
[08:34] <nzhomie> gizmol, are they both installed?
[08:34] <Gizmo1> Yes
[08:34] <nzhomie> what about it ?
[08:34] <arrenlex> FirstStrike: Really. I've always gotten a \B character.
[08:34] <Random_Transit> administrator, sure...why not try shouting like that some more...someone's bound to notice eventually
[08:34] <nzhomie> have you tried connecting the two monitors one 2 each card does it work ?
[08:35] <arrenlex> refus3d: Except for the ugly panel at the bottom, that is one slick desktop.
[08:35] <nzhomie> what about yahoo messenger?
[08:35] <Random_Transit> nzhomie, i like Kopete
[08:35] <Gizmo1> No,   One works the other is full of trash
[08:35] <arrenlex> refus3d: And the menubars.
[08:35] <sonicGB> nzhomie: in kubuntu, kopete is great... not so sure about gnome sorry
[08:35] <FirstStrike> people don't really like my gnome skin, but it suits me
[08:35] <sonicGB> will kopete work on gnome/ubuntu?
[08:35] <Random_Transit> sonicGB, kopete will still work under gnome
[08:35] <refus3d> do show FirstStrike
[08:35] <administrator> Rnadom Transit: have you noticed?
[08:35] <Curs0r> I'm too ugly for a webcam, I use bitlbee lol
[08:36] <sonicGB> Random_Transit: cool... then nzhomie , check out kopete... it's pretty good..
[08:36] <nzhomie> will it work with gnome /
[08:36] <Gizmo1> ???
[08:36] <FirstStrike> http://strikethis.com/wall.jpg
[08:36] <Random_Transit> sonicGB, nzhomie, any and all KDE apps will work fine in GNOME
[08:36] <sonicGB> Curs0r: I have a great face for voice chat! :-) a great face for irc!
[08:36] <arrenlex> nzhomie: Yes.
[08:36] <Random_Transit> because apt auto installs the kde libs
[08:37] <nzhomie> wuicked
[08:37] <sonicGB> ahhh, ok, cool...
[08:37] <refus3d> FirstStrike, i dont like the stacked panels
[08:37] <arrenlex> Mine is pretty standard... but I like it.
[08:37] <arrenlex> http://arrenlex.diff.be/screenshots/5605.png
[08:37] <FirstStrike> i can't stand having one on top and one on the bottom
[08:37] <Random_Transit> yeah, actually, the KDE libs are a part of the default install for ubu since Breezy
[08:38] <FirstStrike> on every fresh install of ubuntu the first thing i do is drag the top panel to the bottom
[08:38] <Curs0r> FirstStrike, me too
[08:38] <Alakazamz0r> Anyone have any clues on this? Im stumped: http://phpfi.com/185173
[08:38] <administrator> plbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
[08:38] <Curs0r> invariably some frickin window ends up getting stuck under that top bar
[08:39] <FirstStrike> hmm..i've never had that happen.
[08:39] <refus3d> very boring arrenlex
[08:39] <Random_Transit> personally, i leave my gnome panels untouched
[08:39] <Random_Transit> more or less
[08:39] <arrenlex> refus3d: Yeah. But convenient. ^^
[08:39] <FirstStrike> my firefox theme is black as well..it matches the gnome theme well.
[08:39] <FirstStrike> plus, i have dslreports with its black theme so..yea.
[08:39] <FirstStrike> no, i'm not emo or goth.
[08:39] <FirstStrike> i just hate bright colors
[08:39] <Random_Transit> lol
[08:39] <Alakazamz0r> anyone?
[08:40] <administrator> Sssssssssssssoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[08:40] <sonicGB> Alakazamz0r: funny thing is, I can ping the ip from here no worries...
[08:40] <fyrestrtr> Alakazamz0r: what's there to be stumped about? The host is offline.
[08:40] <Alakazamz0r> i know
[08:40] <Alakazamz0r> weird eh.
[08:40] <arrenlex> I can't use a system with dark colours... I've been trained by Windows to have white backgrounds and black text.
[08:40] <Alakazamz0r> fyrestrtr, no its not.
[08:40] <Alakazamz0r> mikeking.bounceme.net = the machine im typing from
[08:40] <sonicGB> uhm... on solaris there's an nsswitch.conf in /etc that you have to tell to use /etc/hosts for name service... does linux have a similar concept?
[08:40] <administrator> who lays claim to the goddess of all knowledge?
[08:40] <Curs0r> wo ist a good place to paste a screenie?
[08:40] <sonicGB> ignore administrator
[08:40] <fyrestrtr> Alakazamz0r: check your firewall.
[08:41] <FirstStrike> most people use imageshack if they don't have their own webspace
[08:41] <sonicGB> Alakazamz0r: what fyrestrtr said... a firewall issue? can you ping the IP from the command line... is it a 'network' problem or a name lookup problem?
[08:41] <fyrestrtr> sonicGB: cat /etc/nsswitch.conf

[08:45] <administrator> hmmmmmmmmm
[08:45] <yakumo> ok
[08:45] <administrator> this sucks
[08:46] <sonicGB> yakumo: but it does MSN so well that it's worth having two clients running to cope with MSN, plus all the otehrs
[08:46] <pr3d4t0r> Greetings.
[08:46] <arrenlex> !hi
[08:46] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:46] <sonicGB> greetings
[08:47] <Curs0r> hello and stuff
[08:47] <screechingcat> any suggestions for a feed reader for gnome ?
[08:47] <FirstStrike> salut
[08:47] <pr3d4t0r> Q. I just finished installation of Ubuntu Dapper; I'm experienced with RH, SuSE, OS X, Solaris, and AIX.  Can someone please tell me what would be the advantage of installing/upgrading the machine to Edgy or Feisty?  Thanks in advance.
[08:47] <Random_Transit> screechingcat, do you want a news ticker style or a plain old feed reader?
[08:48] <pr3d4t0r> The machine is intended as a server, not a workstation.
[08:48] <arrenlex> pr3d4t0r: Dapper will not get new versions of software.
[08:48] <Flannel> pr3d4t0r: new versions of software
[08:48] <Flannel> pr3d4t0r: and, edgy and beyong has upstart
[08:48] <arrenlex> pr3d4t0r: If it is intended as a server, you are probably best off keeping dapper.
[08:48] <screechingcat> Random_Transit: plain old desktop app which aggregates feeds and integrates well with gnome
[08:48] <Music_Shuffle> pr3d4t0r, pure fileserver...prolly not any benefits.
[08:48] <FirstStrike> Edgy is 'bleeding edge' and has a lot of the newest software, but might be less stable than Dapper. It's also not an LTS. Feisty really isn't ready yet and is still in development.
[08:48] <Random_Transit> screechingcat, try blam
[08:48] <pr3d4t0r> Music_Shuffle: It's an httpd/qmail server + gateway for an internal DMZ network.
[08:49] <screechingcat> Random_Transit: alright thanks
[08:49] <Random_Transit> screechingcat, there are a bunch
[08:49] <proqesi> Edgy isn't bleeding edge anymore, Feisty is now
[08:49] <screechingcat> Random_Transit: so far ive used liferea and a LOT of firefox extensions
[08:49] <Music_Shuffle> Ok, I should clarify and say 'server, prolly not any real benefits that you can't do without'
[08:49] <Random_Transit> screechingcat, your best bet is to just open up synaptic and search for feed reader
[08:49] <Curs0r> oh nutty fudgkins! i just learned i am not running the smp kernel
[08:50] <screechingcat> Random_Transit: thanks for the advice. appreciated
[08:50] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Great leaping ocelots!!
[08:50] <Curs0r> what would be the easiest way to remedy that?
[08:50] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Why aren't you running -generic?
[08:50] <Random_Transit> screechingcat, not a problem dude
[08:50] <pr3d4t0r> Music_Shuffle: Cool.
[08:50] <Curs0r> i just used the default
[08:50] <arrenlex> Curs0r: What kernel do you have now?
[08:50] <Curs0r> asking grub
[08:50] <pr3d4t0r> Flannel: What is upstart?
[08:50] <arrenlex> Curs0r: uname -r =P
[08:50] <arrenlex> pr3d4t0r: A replacement for sysvinit.
[08:51] <screechingcat> pr3d4t0r: !upstart
[08:51] <arrenlex> !upstart | pr3d4t0r
[08:51] <ubotu> pr3d4t0r: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[08:51] <pr3d4t0r> !upstart
[08:51] <ubotu> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[08:51] <FirstStrike> i need to compile a newer kernel
[08:51] <Curs0r> 2.6.17-10-386
[08:51] <Music_Shuffle> lol.
[08:51] <pr3d4t0r> Ah.
[08:51] <arrenlex> Curs0r: ...wow. apt-get install linux-image-generic
[08:51] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Are you on dapper?
[08:51] <Curs0r> edgy
[08:51] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Yeah, run that.
[08:52] <Curs0r> linux-image-generic is already the newest version.
[08:52] <Music_Shuffle> Then you win. GAME OVER.
[08:52] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Then boot into it! xD
[08:52] <freebse> hi where in kde can I setup the monitor, it was in peripherals, but it seems like they changed it
[08:52] <Curs0r> i did...
[08:53] <arrenlex> freebse: Right-click on the desktop and go to configure desktop. Click on display. Is that what you mean?
[08:53] <pr3d4t0r> Q. I just built the server; is it a good idea to upgrade to Edgy from Dapper?  I'd like to avoid a full install.
[08:53] <pr3d4t0r> Q. If I upgrade, will upstart automagically replace /sbin/init ?
[08:53] <arrenlex> freebse: The same screen is found in kcontrol > peripherals > display
[08:53] <Curs0r> kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 root=/dev/sdc3 ro quiet splash
[08:53] <sonicGB> freebse: it's in "System Settings" on the main menu... "monitor and display"
[08:53] <freebse> arrenlex: na it is not, I want to adjust brightnes
[08:53] <Random_Transit> pr3d4t0r, personally, i've had problems upgrading
[08:54] <sonicGB> freebse: also right-click on desktop to configure destop stuff
[08:54] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: I see.
[08:54] <Random_Transit> pr3d4t0r, i tried to upgrade via the repos, and hosed my current install
[08:54] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: OKi.
[08:54] <Random_Transit> i'm still using Dapper
[08:54] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: So, if I try, the worst that can happen is that I'll have to move the server (again) to my workbench and do a disk installation.
[08:54] <freebse> http://www.multimedia4linux.de/coolscan/monitor_kalibrieren.html >>> this settings, but I can not find them anywhere
[08:55] <arrenlex> Curs0r: If you uname -r reports -386, you are not booted into -generic.
[08:55] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: OKi, thanks for the feedback.
[08:55] <Random_Transit> pr3d4t0r, pretty much, depending on how you've partitioned things
[08:55] <Curs0r> arrenlex, so that should say kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic?
[08:55] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: LVM.
[08:55] <Random_Transit> pr3d4t0r, not a problem
[08:55] <proqesi> when I try to apt-get install pptpconfig I get the error: pptpconfig: Depends: php-pcntl (>= 4.3.7) but it is not installable
[08:55] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: It's almost a pristine installation.
[08:55] <sonicGB> freebse: system settings --> monitor and display --> color and gamma
[08:55] <proqesi> how do I fix this?
[08:55] <Curs0r> right, brb
[08:55] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: So if I whack it there's no data loss or anything.
[08:55] <sonicGB> different interfce, but the same functionality
[08:56] <Random_Transit> pr3d4t0r, might have some minimal loss, but nothing tragic
[08:56] <proqesi> my repos are up to date, and I can't explicitly install that package
[08:56] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: OKi.
[08:56] <Flannel> proqesi: er... pptpconfig isn't in any repositories.  Which 3rd party ones do you have?
[08:56] <pr3d4t0r> Random_Transit: Do you know if upstart will automagically replace /sbin/init after the upgrade?
[08:56] <freebse> sonicGB: sorry I ask dumb questions, but I am not a KDE User, I set this up for a friend, kcontrol ist System Settings ?
[08:57] <Random_Transit> pr3d4t0r, i wouldn't know, i don't use upstart...still on Dapper
[08:57] <proqesi> Flannel: the usual deb http://quozl.netrek.org/pptp/pptpconfig ./
[08:57] <dos000> is there a way i can right click in nautilus and start a terminal on the selected folder ?
[08:57] <screechingcat> pr3d4t0r: if you're still thinking about that edgy upgrade then dont.. if u want to use edgy that badly, do a clean install
[08:57] <Flannel> pr3d4t0r: it'll update all things appropriately.
[08:57] <sonicGB> freebse: no problem... I'm not highly clued with gui stuff either... I'm just getting "system settings" from the main menu....
[08:57] <screechingcat> pr3d4t0r: too many upgrade horror stories
[08:57] <proqesi> Flannel: is this package not available for AMD 64-bit?
[08:57] <pr3d4t0r> screechingcat: OKi.
[08:58] <pr3d4t0r> Flannel: :)
[08:58] <Flannel> proqesi: then you'll have to ask them where their dependencies are, as php-pcntl isn't in any official repositories either
[08:58] <pr3d4t0r> Flannel: Conflicting input.
[08:58] <proqesi> Flannel: ask who?
[08:58] <sonicGB> freebse: no, it's not kcontrol, it's actually 'systemsettings'
[08:58] <arrenlex> freebse: AH! I knew I saw it somewhere.
[08:58] <pr3d4t0r> Aw, what the hell; let's try upgrading it.  At worst I'll have to download the ISO image and start over :)
[08:58] <arrenlex> freebse: You need to install kgamma.
[08:58] <pr3d4t0r> Thanks everyone.
[08:58] <arrenlex> freebse: Then it will appear.
[08:58] <Flannel> proqesi: whoever runs that repository
[08:59] <Random_Transit> pr3d4t0r, good luck...odds are you'll need it
[08:59] <proqesi> Flannel: hmm .. ok
[08:59] <sonicGB> arrenlex: I have the gamma thing on a default kubunto 6.10 install here...
[08:59] <freebse> arrenlex: thx I think this is what is needed here, thx a lot
[08:59] <miniman> Anyone available?
[08:59] <screechingcat> pr3d4t0r: and use the official recommended update-manager -c method and nothing else
[08:59] <arrenlex> freebse: No problem. Then they will appear on Peripherals - Display -  Monitor Gamma.
[08:59] <screechingcat> miniman: !anyone

[09:00] <miniman> kk..I tried to install frostwire, and now it says that it needs to be reinsallted, but it cant find an archive for it..AndI don't know how to fix it..Any help?
[09:00] <arrenlex> _goofy_: What's the output of "glxinfo | grep ender"?
[09:00] <Flannel> !frostwire | miniman
[09:00] <ubotu> miniman: frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[09:00] <Flannel> miniman: that page should have all the info you need
[09:00] <miniman> kk Ill check it out
[09:01] <miniman> thanks
[09:01] <freebse> arrenlex: sorry it is installed and does not appear anywhere, I can set this up with gnome-control-center and xfce-settings, but KDE changes it everytime I login a kde session
[09:01] <freebse> I hate GUI spec. functions :)
[09:01] <screechingcat> miniman: why not just use LimeWire. thats open-source and free too
[09:01] <_goofy_> direct rendering: No OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
[09:01] <miniman> Well I cannot install any packages until I get this fixed, it won't let me.
[09:01] <arrenlex> _goofy_: What happens if you run the "xf86gammacfg" command?
[09:01] <arrenlex> _goofy_: That's a no.
[09:01] <arrenlex> _goofy_: Sorry, that xf86gamma wasn't for you.
[09:02] <arrenlex> freebse: It was for you. What happens if you run the "xf86gammacfg" command?
[09:02] <arrenlex> _goofy_: You don't have 3D accel.
[09:02] <gummpppp> has anyone had problems accessing yahoo mail using firefox?
[09:02] <pr3d4t0r> He, he, he... let's see what happens.
[09:02] <pr3d4t0r> Installing ~300 MB now.
[09:02] <Music_Shuffle> gummpppp, not I.
[09:02] <screechingcat> arrenlex: and if that command says yes, does that mean its enabled ?
[09:02] <_goofy_> thanks...i was trying to do it from memory....i must google.....
=== Random_Transit is now known as RT_Away
[09:03] <arrenlex> screechingcat: If the renderer string is not "GLX indirect" then it is enabled.
[09:03] <tux> hi can any1 help?
[09:03] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Direct rendering must be "yes" for 3D to be on, but it can be "yes" without it being on.
[09:03] <sonicGB> I just went to frostwire, hit the download for the mac osx version, and got taken to paypal. what's with that
[09:03] <Music_Shuffle> !ask | tux
[09:03] <ubotu> tux: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:03] <sonicGB> !anyone | tux
[09:03] <ubotu> tux: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[09:03] <screechingcat> arrenlex: Mesa DRI Intel ?
[09:03] <gummpppp> has any one had any prolems with email program call evolution?
[09:03] <Music_Shuffle> HAH! I WIN.
[09:03] <miniman> Tux?
[09:03] <tux> how can i change the screen resolution?
[09:04] <freebse> arrenlex: ya this works, but I call this a workaround, I just want to show the guy the settings where he can set it up : http://www.multimedia4linux.de/coolscan/monitor_kalibrieren.html - nothing else :) arghh, this is driving me nuts
[09:04] <pr3d4t0r> tux: KDE or Gnome?
[09:04] <tux> gnome
[09:04] <arrenlex> screechingcat: If it's not indirect, it's accelerated. Intel's drivers are GPL so they are handled by Mesa, the 3D infrastructure.
[09:04] <tux> mine is now 640*...
[09:04] <screechingcat> arrenlex: right thanks
[09:04] <tux> im running xfce
[09:04] <arrenlex> freebse: when I installed kgamma, that exact screen appeared for me in that exact location.
[09:05] <tux> and i cant get more than that in display settings
[09:05] <Curs0r> well, that was fun
[09:05] <Music_Shuffle> tux, gnome or xfce? Not the same thing.
[09:05] <sonicGB> tux: that implies video card/driver issues I think....
[09:05] <Curs0r> i now have an smp kernel but the nvidia driver is borked lol
[09:05] <tux> sorry xfce
[09:06] <arrenlex> Curs0r: apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[09:06] <freebse> arrenlex: believe me I got it installed, apt tells me it is, and no settings... anyway I feel stupid, I gonna find it out myself, there is no point in asking more dumb GUI questions :)
[09:06] <tux> sonicGB, how to change?
[09:06] <Curs0r> says already the newest version again
[09:06] <sonicGB> tux: do you know what video card you have... do you know if the window manager knows about it?
[09:07] <arrenlex> Curs0r: and you're sure you're running -generic now? =P
[09:07] <tux> sonicGB, but i got  a resl or 800*.. earlier
[09:07] <Curs0r> arrenlex, jawohl!
[09:07] <arrenlex> Curs0r: I will for some reason assume that is a yes. Define "borked". How did X start?
[09:07] <freebse> this is why I don't use KDE, it is too much setup stuff that is rather unimportant and you can not find the usefull stuff inside all this crap :)
[09:07] <tux> sonicGB, but now some1 has changed it adn i cant revert
[09:08] <Curs0r> i changed the driver to nv
[09:08] <arrenlex> Curs0r: what happened if it was nvidia?
[09:08] <sonicGB> tux: I'm kinda guessing here... I've only got windows, os x and kde in front of me here.. no xfce sorry
[09:08] <arrenlex> Curs0r: the nvidia-glx package is installed?
[09:08] <arrenlex> freebse: Lies! That package comes installed by default in kubuntu. I love KDE precisely because it gives you the option to change everything. I LOVE customisability.
[09:08] <sonicGB> so in the display config, 640x480 is the largest option now?
[09:09] <tux> sonicGB, ysh
[09:09] <Curs0r> well that's bizzarre before modprobe wouldn't install it, now it gives me the xorg error
[09:09] <sonicGB> arrenlex: but KDE confuses the users! <grin> :-)
[09:09] <arrenlex> Curs0r: ...?
[09:09] <Curs0r> Not loading nvidia module; not used in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:09] <freebse> arrenlex: I set it up with gnome, all I needed to do is to start gnome-control-center at the start of kde and it keeps the settings :) bah, rubish workaround ... :) LOL
[09:09] <arrenlex> sonicGB: No it doesn't, because you can use it without touching a single option. But if you want to mess with it you can.
[09:09] <tux> sonicGB, but perv. the sys was havin 800*
[09:09] <sonicGB> tux: are you aware of having changed anything
[09:09] <Curs0r> guess what i'm doing now ;)
[09:10] <tux> sonicGB, no
[09:10] <sonicGB> arrenlex: I shall in future raise my hand in the air when I'm being facetious :-) :-)
[09:10] <tux> sonicGB, but i hav root access
[09:10] <arrenlex> sonicGB: ...oh. xD
[09:10] <sonicGB> haha!
[09:11] <tux> sonicGB, hi any way..? im fed up with this
[09:11] <sonicGB> tux: does this help you? http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=176407
[09:11] <tux> sonicGB, thnk u
[09:12] <sonicGB> tux: no point in getting fed up with me...  I'm trying my best here!
[09:12] <sonicGB> u welcome
[09:12] <sonicGB> (but read it before you thank me, it might be garbage!!!)
[09:12] <Curs0r> modprobe nvidia returns "Error running install command"
[09:13] <sonicGB> now there's a quiet moment, I'm gonna go look in the dictionary for 'facetious' :-)
[09:13] <arrenlex> sonicGB: http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=facetious
[09:13] <sonicGB> gott it, thanks :-)
[09:13] <arrenlex> ...wait, didn't YOU use that word?
[09:13] <sonicGB> and yes, it does mean what I hoped it meant!
[09:13] <sonicGB> LOL
[09:13] <arrenlex> Ah. xD
[09:13] <arrenlex> I did that on a test once with "emanicpated".
[09:13] <arrenlex> I turned out to be lucky too.
[09:14] <arrenlex> emancipated *
[09:14] <sonicGB> yeah, emancipated is a crap word... it doesn't mean what I think it means! lol
[09:14] <arrenlex> What do you think it wins?
[09:14] <sonicGB> well, it's a good work, but I thought it meant something like 'castrated' or 'eliminated', so I never used it! lol
[09:14] <arrenlex> XD!
[09:15] <sonicGB> %s/work/word/
[09:15] <Curs0r> arrenlex, any ideas?
[09:15] <arrenlex> "Flee, black slaves! You have been emancipated!" "...ow! My family jewels!"
[09:15] <sonicGB> LOL
[09:15] <Curs0r> haha
[09:15] <sonicGB> emancipate the eunuchs! :-)
[09:16] <Curs0r> sweet freedom! for whatever it's worth without yer huevos

[09:16] <Lunis> how can i stop ubuntu from fsck'ing my vfat filesystem at boot? it takes forever and i don't want/need it
[09:17] <fyrestrtr> Lunis: man tune2fs
[09:18] <firebird619> Could someone help me? I am trying to install kdenlive, but it says Depends: libqt3-mt (>= 3:3.3.7) but 3:3.3.6-3ubuntu3 is to be installed. It also says the same for other packages. How can I fix this?
[09:18] <arrenlex> firebird619: From the official repositories?
[09:19] <arrenlex> firebird619: I see the answer is no. You can fix it by finding an older version or compiling from source.
[09:19] <cafuego_> firebird619: Try to not install packages that are not in Ubuntu 6.10
[09:20] <sonicGB> fyrestrtr: is it as simple as making the last column in fstab = zero?
[09:20] <frogzoo> lucasvo_: set the 6th field in fstab = 0
[09:20] <sonicGB> snap
[09:20] <frogzoo> too late, he's gone
[09:20] <sonicGB> yeah
[09:20] <firebird619> arrenlex: No, A repo I got from the KDEnlive site. I tried source, but it still gives a message about needing QT. Which exact packages do I need to resolve that dependency.
[09:21] <arrenlex> firebird619: kde-devel to compile from source.
[09:21] <sonicGB> ouch!
[09:21] <firebird619> arrenlex: Thanks
[09:21] <arrenlex> firebird619: Hold on, you don't need all that.
[09:21] <arrenlex> firebird619: kdebase-dev should suffice.
[09:22] <arrenlex> Yes, that should work.
[09:22] <firebird619> arrenlex: Ok, Thank You
[09:22] <Curs0r> nvidia-glx_1.0.9631+2.6.17.8-1_i386.deb is in my /var/cache/apt/archives, should i delete that?
[09:23] <arrenlex> Curs0r: archives is where apt keeps files as a cache. It manages them automatically. The fact that a package is in cache does not mean it is installed, and it won't interfere with apt finding a newer package. You can keep it.
[09:23] <Curs0r> ok
[09:24] <Curs0r> any particular reason why that package wouldn't work for me?
[09:24] <arrenlex> Curs0r: What package?
[09:24] <Curs0r> nvidia-glx_1.0.9631+2.6.17.8-1_i386.deb
[09:24] <arrenlex> ! doesn't work

[09:24] <arrenlex> What happened to the "sits on IRC all day" factoid?!
[09:25] <frogzoo> arrenlex: that sux :p
[09:26] <arrenlex> (09:42:05 PM) ubotu: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[09:26] <Curs0r> when i reinstall the nvidia package everything goes smoothly until i modprobe nvidia and i get "Error running the install command"
[09:26] <arrenlex> That's what it was :)
[09:26] <barata> hey ... anybody can sweet-talk Picasa for me? Is it supposed to be the best pic viewer in *Nix now?
[09:27] <Curs0r> i assumed you had read that when i posted it before, i did indeed elaborate, you missed it :P
[09:27] <Adlai_> barata, it's pretty good
[09:27] <barata> I get sick & tired with gthumb that seems to suffer from a memory leak and hang all the time
[09:27] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Ah, then I cannot read. Please summarise?
[09:27] <Adlai_> depends what you want to do
[09:27] <Curs0r> when i reinstall the nvidia package everything goes smoothly until i modprobe nvidia and i get "Error running the install command"
[09:28] <barata> I also hate gqview that doesnt hang so often; but doesnt allow a FULL folder browse (thumbnails)
[09:28] <barata> thanks Adlai_
[09:28] <Curs0r> the package installs fine, it gripes about xorg like normal, it just won't load the driver

[09:28] <fyrestrtr> barata: try pornview
[09:28] <frogzoo> barata: find the bug & submit a patch
[09:28] <arrenlex> Curs0r: ...could you pastebin that process please?
[09:28] <fyrestrtr> sonicGB: are you looking for picasa for linux?
[09:29] <Curs0r> sure, if you could kindly define that action ^-^
[09:29] <barata> who cares about a patch frogzoo ... I just need to use it & shop around
[09:29] <sonicGB> responding to barata, fyrestrtr
[09:29] <sonicGB> is picasa available for *nix ?
[09:29] <frogzoo> sonicGB: absolument
[09:29] <barata> sonicGB: picasa is available for Linux since a long time ago
[09:29] <fyrestrtr> sonicGB: yes. I have it running here :)
[09:29] <frogzoo> sonicGB: google wrote it to run under the wine api - which was a clever move
[09:30] <Adlai_> yes it was
[09:30] <barata> that's what I dont like frogzoo
[09:30] <barata> using winshit api ... meaning using wine
[09:30] <frogzoo> barata: wine api is real linux
[09:30] <sonicGB> ahh, found it: http://picasa.google.com/linux/
[09:30] <Adlai_> fyrestrtr, haha pornview
[09:30] <barata> thats why I uninstalled it back then
[09:30] <Adlai_> dunno about that, for whatever reason gentoo doesn't support it anymore
[09:30] <barata> but now I start collecting pics ... huge-huge pics in size & volume
[09:30] <barata> all available things seem to be bad now
[09:31] <Adlai_> barata, what's bad?
[09:31] <barata> gthumb is good for a small volume pics, but for the big ones ... it seems that the code has done something wrong with the memory allocation stuffs
[09:32] <barata> I DONT KNOW ... I'm just GUESSING ... okey
[09:32] <frogzoo> curiously, there no picasa in the repos... :(
[09:32] <barata> but I know that it always hangs after grasping for memory
[09:32] <barata> picasa (I think) is proprietary
[09:32] <dope> where can i download the mac bar like thing for ubuntu?
[09:32] <arrenlex> frogzoo: It's not surprising. It's proprietary.
[09:32] <tux> hi where is the Xf86config file located?
[09:32] <zeeed> hi, can smb help me with wireless connection configuration?
[09:32] <Adlai_> dope, what wm do you use?
[09:32] <arrenlex> frogzoo: I assume it is illegal for anyone but google to distribute it.

[09:33] <frogzoo> arrenlex: ah, thx for that
[09:33] <Adlai_> guys talking about picasa, there's a repo I have that lets you install picasa
[09:33] <strabes> zeeed: what exactly is your problem?
[09:33] <barata> another reason is because it's still an ongoing thing that Google doesnt guarantee the maturity
[09:33] <Adlai_> hold on and I'll boot up my laptop and show you
[09:33] <zeeed> strabes: it difficult to say it in one sentence
=== numist is now known as drunkmist
[09:34] <strabes> zeeed: do you have network-manager-gnome installed?
[09:34] <barata> FYI, all, download picasa from here: http://picasa.google.com/linux/thanks-other.html
[09:35] <zeeed> strabes: yes, but it doesn't show any aps, but when i run iwlist ath0 scan it show 2 APs, I've aslo tried wifi-radar it show all 2 Aps, but I can connect :/
[09:35] <Curs0r> arrenlex, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37300/
[09:35] <zeeed> strabes: my network manager: http://img279.imageshack.us/img279/8113/ubuntuvu2.png
[09:36] <barata> picasa requires 76MB
[09:36] <barata> definitely not a small program for a *Nix standard
[09:36] <zeeed> strabes: strabes: and network-manager error msg: http://wklej.org/id/c9bf5383e6
[09:36] <arrenlex> Curs0r: What's with the random third-party repository? Is ubuntu not good enough?
[09:36] <barata> anyway, I'm ready to JUST USE picasa and remove gthumb/gqview
[09:37] <Adlai_> everyone talking about picasa: echo "deb http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/ stable non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:37] <zeeed> strabes: any ideas?
[09:37] <ThePub> Anyone have experience setting up beryl to run under Xgl?
[09:37] <Adlai_> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install picasa
[09:37] <Curs0r> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Beta_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29 i was just following directions
[09:37] <strabes> !ask | ThePub
[09:37] <ubotu> ThePub: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:38] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Why do you need the beta?
[09:38] <barata> Adlai_: just download, then "chmod a+x picasa*.bin" then "sh picasa*.bin" and you're done
[09:38] <strabes> zeeed: that imageshack url doesn't work. do i have to have an account to see it?
[09:38] <Curs0r> it was in the instructions for installing beryl
[09:38] <Adlai_> but it's cooler if you use the package manager =D
[09:38] <zeeed> strabes: no,  let me check
[09:38] <barata> it just takes me less than 10 minutes
[09:38] <arrenlex> Curs0r: I think you should try the tried and true drivers first and use the betas only if you need to.
[09:38] <strabes> zeeed: your wireless interface is usually eth1. is it enabled? sudo ifconfig eth1 up
[09:39] <ThePub> I love when people use the bot, but have no clue about why someone would ask a general question.
[09:39] <zeeed> strabes: url is working for my, and i don't have any account on imageshack, i don't know why you can't see it :(
[09:39] <arrenlex> ThePub: What do you mean?
[09:39] <Adlai_> ThePub, I do, but it was a bad experience and I couldn't repeat it for you
[09:40] <strabes> zeeed: sorry
[09:40] <sphorbis> question: when i try to log on, nothing happens, this is after the logong screen
[09:40] <sphorbis> logon*
[09:40] <zeeed> strabes: my ifconfig: http://wklej.org/id/b0a2ed921f
[09:40] <xipietotec> what I would like is someone to take a look at my laptop and tell me why I can only access my flicker virtual file system in "true root" (Sudo su, sudo -i)
[09:41] <xipietotec> no matter how I chown stuff or whatnot
[09:41] <zeeed> strabes: my iwconfig: http://wklej.org/id/5f817a46f0
[09:41] <frogzoo> Adlai_: thx for that
[09:41] <arrenlex> xipietotec: fstab permissions.
[09:41] <barata> the best pic viewer I think is acdc ... too bad it's only for winshit
[09:41] <arrenlex> xipietotec: If you mount in fstab, pass umask=000 in the options.
[09:41] <Adlai_> frogzoo, what
[09:42] <Adlai_> oh, picasa?
[09:42] <frogzoo> Adlai_: the picasa repo
[09:42] <Adlai_> no problem
[09:42] <untony2> how do i remove a package and all of its dependencies?
[09:42] <xipietotec> I mounted in /mnt/flickrfs using fuse
[09:42] <Adlai_> it was from a wiki somewhere
[09:42] <barata> acdc can even open up multiple pages tif files ... I wonder if picasa can
[09:42] <zeeed> strabes: wifi-radar show AP, but when I tried connect I failed :( ...
[09:42] <barata> I think this tif business has an issue with Kodak's IP
[09:42] <zeeed> strabes: why network-manager isn't working?
[09:43] <sphorbis> can someone tell me the name of a text only web browser?
[09:43] <barata> and until now I still cannot find a multi-pages-tif-files viewer
[09:43] <Adlai_> frogzoo, it came from http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[09:43] <Adlai_> sphorbis, links
[09:43] <Adlai_> frogzoo, I just used Trevino's sources.list
[09:43] <barata> hallo xipietotec.... nice to see you under Ubuntu
[09:44] <untony2> how do i remove a package and all of its dependencies???
[09:44] <arrenlex> untony2: How did you install it?
[09:44] <barata> normally I see you bashing in #politics

[09:44] <barata> frogzoo too ... you can frogjump into Ubuntu ....:)
[09:44] <xipietotec> I just wish someone would make a GUI disk encryption utility for thumbdrives for linux
[09:45] <barata> what is a GUI disk encryption?
[09:45] <xipietotec> (what I really want is one that will work in both linux and windows, GUI both times, but that seems to be asking waaayyy too much)
[09:45] <barata> for encrypting the whole partition like Vista?
[09:45] <barata> sound like Xen
[09:45] <barata> have you tried that?
[09:45] <untony2> arrenlex: i installed it via apt-get and synaptic
[09:46] <untony2> arrenlex does it mayyer?
[09:46] <untony2> matter
[09:46] <Slart> xipietotec: truecrypt can't do that?
[09:46] <arrenlex> untony2: Yes, it matters.
[09:46] <barata> with Xen you can move about Lin & Win just like you move from Thunderbird to Firefox
[09:46] <arrenlex> untony2: For apt-get, when you remove a package, run apt-get autoremove to remove its dependencies.
[09:46] <untony2> arrenlex: i cant remember the installation
[09:46] <arrenlex> untony2: For aptitude, if you remove a package it will automatically remove dependencies.
[09:46] <untony2> arrenlex: what about for synaptic
[09:46] <xipietotec> Slart: ....I dunno, I haven't taken a look at truecrypt....does it have GUI?
[09:46] <barata> I dont use it myself, but that's what the Xen users told me & what I read about it
[09:46] <arrenlex> untony2: For synaptic, I don't know.
[09:46] <xipietotec> !truecrypt
[09:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about truecrypt - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:48] <barata> what is /mp3?
[09:48] <Slart> barata: to make the curious work hard cracking useless stuff.. ;)
[09:49] <xipietotec> argh....they want me to use tarbells and compressed keys....why not package management...argh
[09:49] <pr3d4t0r> UbuntuNewbie: Did you create a regular user?
[09:49] <Slart> barata: the folder where you keep all your, legally bought and converted to mp3, music =)
[09:49] <barata> unless one has a criminal intent in mind then one doesnt need any encrypted stuffs
[09:49] <barata> WHAT FOR?
[09:49] <pr3d4t0r> UbuntuNewbie: If so, log on as that user, then open a terminal and from there type:  sudo bash

[09:49] <frogzoo> barata: in some jurisdictions, use of libdvdcss is criminal
[09:50] <arrenlex> pr3d4t0r: The command you should be recommending is "sudo -i"
[09:50] <barata> like in where frogzoo? The Frogcountry.fr?
[09:50] <UbuntuNewbie> "sudo -i" from the terminal?
[09:50] <jareth_> arrelex: what about sudo su?
[09:51] <barata> Slart: are you in Europe?
[09:51] <Slart> barata: yes, why?
[09:51] <barata> ok, Swedia
[09:51] <arrenlex> jareth_: That's anathema as well.
[09:51] <Slart> barata: Sweden to be more precise
[09:51] <barata> no wonder you worry about government intervention
[09:51] <barata> and you feel compelled to encrypt your movies/music
[09:52] <jareth_> arrenlex: what do yu mean by that?
[09:52] <UbuntuNewbie> ah... Im root! :)
[09:52] <arrenlex> jareth_: I mean that you're not supposed to use it. Use sudo -i.
[09:52] <Curs0r> arrenlex, now the standard drivers claim that something conflicts with them
[09:52] <Slart> barata: nah.. I dont encrypt my music.. can't be arsed.. but I understand if someone would want to
[09:52] <arrenlex> Curs0r: "something" is hard to troubleshoot. =P
[09:52] <barata> anyway ... for an argument sake ... let's say you get caught and you say you borrow the DVD/CD from a local library and rip them ... is that not a strong argument?
[09:52] <Curs0r> yes it is
[09:52] <jareth_> arrenlex: i see.. was just curious about the diff's ;)
[09:52] <barata> or say you had bought the stuffs ... what can the obnoxious Euro-aparathic do?
[09:52] <xipietotec> Slart: thanks for showing me that :)
[09:53] <Slart> barata: it's been a couple of years since we last had a military coup where they shot people in the streets for having "dangerous" documents on their computers.. =)
[09:53] <Slart> xipietotec: it worked? it does disc encryption?
[09:53] <Slart> xipietotec: I just remember trying it on windows a year or so ago
[09:53] <Curs0r> how do i switch to the "advanced mode" in the default package manager?
[09:54] <arrenlex> We're past that now, thankfully. Now egregious Big Brother corporations track all your actions and use underhanded methods to force you to surrender your constitutional rights lest you starve.
[09:54] <arrenlex> :) god bless America.
[09:54] <UbuntuNewbie> Thanx! I'll most likely be back with more newbie questions!
[09:54] <barata> AMEN ARRENLEX ... God Bless America and GPL
[09:54] <Curs0r> arrenlex, sounds a lot like the third reich doesn't it?
[09:54] <barata> FYI: GPL is "made in America"
[09:55] <Slart> Does anyone know of a irc-client that has a "find as you type" feature.. kind of like in firefox..that filters the channel text?
[09:55] <nzhomie> advanced? do you mean normal synapltic?
[09:55] <nzhomie> synaptic?
[09:55] <Curs0r> i suppose
[09:55] <arrenlex> Curs0r: No, the third reich was more the "shoot you" thing.
[09:55] <arrenlex> Curs0r: beaureaucratic corruption is a hallmark of god-given democracy. :)
[09:56] <Curs0r> it calls itself Add/Remove Applications
[09:56] <nzhomie> slart, system, administration, synaptic package manager
[09:56] <Curs0r> umm yup that's it but i just found it on the main menu
[09:56] <Slart> nzhomie: mm, I've been there.. searched.. didn't find anything nice.. I'm using gnome-xchat at the moment
[09:58] <xipietotec> Slart: it does disk encryption....not sure if its GUI on the linux end, but it is on the windows end
[09:58] <barata> hey folk, I think I would love Picasa ... it's now still catalogin my pics

[09:58] <ubun> how do you pronounce 'queue'?
[09:59] <arrenlex> Ubun: Like Q.
[09:59] <ubun> q-you or just 'q'
[09:59] <arrenlex> The letter.
[09:59] <Slart> xipietotec: nice... might have to check it out on linux too... too bad about the lack of ready made packages..
[09:59] <Pie-rate> why did the number of simultaneous keyboard presses my computer can register go down when i installed linux? is there any way to rectify this?
[09:59] <ubun> dang i been pronouncing it as 'q-u' for some reason :/
[10:00] <xipietotec> so I at least should be able to access my disks in both OS's, which is important
[10:00] <Slart> Pie-rate: hmm.. I've noticed that too... when playing some games..shout if you find anything
[10:00] <frogzoo> Pie-rate: you mean beyond ctrl,shift,alt ?
[10:00] <dope> should i run KDE
[10:00] <dope> is it better than gnome
[10:00] <Jordan_U> dope: It is subjective
[10:01] <arrenlex> !better
[10:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about better - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:01] <arrenlex> ...oh. I guess not. Sorry.
[10:01] <dope> the application menu at the bottom left is nice
[10:01] <frogzoo> dope: ubuntu is pretty much developed with gnome in mind
[10:01] <arrenlex> Thought there was one.
[10:01] <dope> oh
[10:01] <Slart> frogzoo: not only those.. other keys aswell.. when playing fps-games for example.. running, crouching, etc etc
[10:01] <arrenlex> dope: But "better" is subjective, yes. Try it if you want, you might like it.
[10:01] <Pie-rate> frogzoo: I mean for example forward+KP_0+KP_1
[10:01] <dope> i don't wanna reinstall
[10:01] <Pie-rate> KP_1 doesn't register
[10:01] <ubun> i think there is an absolute better... whichever is used by less people is better :P
[10:02] <Pie-rate> err, i mean KP_2 actually, KP_1 works
[10:03] <arrenlex> ubun: Then why aren't you on the Tandy and writing with stone tablets and walking around naked? =P
[10:03] <barata> <xipietotec> so I at least should be able to access my disks in both OS's, which is important --> this is illogical xipiet ... if your Linux encrypted disk can even be seen from your win partition ... then what's the point of encrypting it AT ALL?
[10:04] <barata> if you can ... what makes others cannot decrypt that?
[10:04] <barata> and thus putting your effort in vain?
[10:04] <Slart> barata: you becuase you can see that it's there doesn't mean you can read the contents
[10:04] <dope> is there a way to install kubuntu with ubuntu already on it?
[10:04] <dope> install kubuntu over ubuntu?
[10:05] <Pie-rate> dope: install ubuntu, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[10:05] <rausb0> dope: apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[10:05] <dope> ok cool, thx
[10:05] <arrenlex> dope: Just install kdebase.
[10:05] <barata> it's like Vista Slart ... Linux will never be able to read its decrypted content (unless one cracks it of course)
[10:05] <arrenlex> dope: kubunu-desktop installs ALL of kubuntu -- this is a lot of applications you don't need if you just want to try it out.
[10:05] <dope> i want the whole thing!
[10:05] <cyzie_> is there a fast way to fix grub problem? i got error 17
[10:05] <arrenlex> dope: kdebase includes only the basic packages you need to start using KDE. If you like it... xD Fine.
[10:05] <nzhomie> ok who needs help ?
[10:05] <barata> but then again, if Linux can understand the algorithm .. doesnt that mean the whole thing is just useless?
[10:05] <Slart> barata: but with truecrypt (which is available on both) you can use the encrypted disk from both
[10:05] <dope> whoa
[10:06] <dope> that's half a gig
[10:06] <dope> almost
[10:06] <dope> so just install kdebase?
[10:06] <Slart> barata: encryption is not about hiding secrets.. except the key
[10:06] <barata> ok ... maybe it's simply because I dont understand what trucrypt really is
[10:06] <frogzoo> !grub | cyzie_
[10:06] <ubotu> cyzie_: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:06] <arrenlex> dope: kdebase will set you up with what you need to run KDE itself. It doesn't include all the fancy programs.
[10:06] <Pie-rate> !kubuntu-desktop
[10:06] <ubotu> k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[10:06] <frogzoo> cyzie_: error 17 means grub can't find your root fs
[10:07] <dope> will it look like kubuntu with the start button in the bottom left?
[10:07] <Slart> barata: it's a program that encrypts a hard drive.. if you want to use it you have to input a password.. no password. no files...
[10:07] <arrenlex> dope: I don't believe kubuntu has that start button. That is a SuSE thing.
[10:08] <barata> uboty & cyzie_: use a live cd disc ... then chroot into your linux partition ... reactivate the grub again ... then reboot
[10:08] <Slart> barata: it's using well known encryption methods that you can read about in any book.. the strength of the encryption doesn't rely on the method being secret (which is usually bad)
[10:08] <cyzie_> frogzoo, thanks for the info. but how i actually fix it? i have check /boot/grub/menu.lst and it seem correct
[10:08] <dope> http://www.thecodingstudio.com/opensource/linux/screenshots/original/Kubuntu%206.10/5.gif
[10:08] <Pie-rate> i like gnome, it works great and doesnt have stupid bouncing icons... GAAAH THOSE PISS ME OFF SO MUCH. I know you can remove them but I hate the KDE developers for putting them in in the first place
[10:08] <bradley> how would i see/watch the load on my video memory?  there some sort of app?
[10:08] <cyzie_> barata, ? chroot partition ?
[10:08] <arrenlex> dope: But it will look exactly the same, the only difference will be that you don't get all the programs that come with the whole desktop (text editors, calculators, etc.)
[10:08] <arrenlex> (,games, screensavers...)
[10:08] <barata> you lose your grub, right? yes cyzie_
[10:08] <dope> ah hell
[10:08] <Adlai_> dpi/dt, don't hate
[10:08] <cyzie_> barata, apparently.. :( how do i fix it ?
[10:08] <rausb0> Pie-rate: you mean the start notification in kde?
[10:09] <Pie-rate> rausb0: yes
[10:09] <dope> i bet i just fubared my system
[10:09] <rausb0> Pie-rate: yeah, i always turn that off
[10:09] <Pie-rate> dope: what'd you do?
[10:09] <dope> installed kdebase
[10:09] <Curs0r> ok, i got it... that was involved... lol
[10:09] <barata> cyzie_: use a livecd like Ubuntu's ... boot it ... then chroot into your linux partition (you know how to, right); once there, reactivate grub (read the howto)
[10:09] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Is it working? :O
[10:09] <rausb0> Pie-rate: but usually i dont work with kde anyway
[10:10] <Pie-rate> dope: how would that fubar your system? you can always just remove it
[10:10] <dope> i hope so
[10:10] <Pie-rate> apt-get remove kdebase will remove it
[10:10] <arrenlex> Pie-rate: No it won't; it's a metapackage.
[10:10] <dope> will grub be ok if i do that
[10:10] <Pie-rate> arrenlex: oh. meh, how do you get rid of it then?
[10:10] <barata> Slart: that argument that the 'best encryption is the most open encryption" is interesting ... I'll read it more next time
[10:10] <frogzoo> Pie-rate: installing kde can screw up your menus
[10:11] <Badkitty> Does anyone know of a goo photoshop irc channel?
[10:11] <dope> i mean gnome
[10:11] <arrenlex> Pie-rate: By using apt-get autoremove
[10:11] <arrenlex> dope: You can choose which desktop to use in your display manager (GDM).
[10:11] <dope> hmm
[10:11] <Pie-rate> arrenlex well yeah, that's kind of implied since it will tell you to use autoremove when you run remove
[10:11] <Curs0r> arrenlex, it is indeed working
[10:11] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Yay!
[10:11] <barata> cyzie_ even when you use livecd you can also go online! so, boot it and go online as you try to fix your grub
[10:12] <bradley> frogzoo, hi i spoke with you earlier tonight and you recommended htop... can you recommend something to view video memory usage?
[10:12] <Curs0r> i had to reinstall the restricted modules for some reason
[10:12] <cyzie_> barata, very funny. thanks
[10:12] <Curs0r> arrenlex, thanks for your help
[10:12] <frogzoo> bradley: htop will show proc size
[10:12] <arrenlex> Curs0r: What help was this? xD
[10:12] <barata> cyzie_> barata, very funny. thanks --> well, Linux livecds are god sent CDs
[10:13] <bradley> frogzoo, what is proc and how do i get it to display?
[10:13] <dope> ok i like kde but....
[10:14] <dope> when i run xchat it looks like it's running in wine
[10:14] <barata> your xchat is gnome/gtk thing, right dope?
[10:14] <dope> i guess so
[10:14] <dope> i need a kde irc client?
[10:14] <barata> that's a common problem
[10:14] <arrenlex> dope: That's weird. If you didn't uninstall anything your GUI shouldn't change.
[10:15] <barata> well, everything is functional ... only that it's aesthetically ugly to the eyes
[10:15] <Curs0r> my desktop --> http://123pichosting.com/images/1100Screenshot.png
[10:15] <dope> wow that's nice
[10:15] <dope> how do i do that
[10:16] <barata> I guess there must be a solution to that dope; but I never care to fix it ... just to let you know that it's a common thing
[10:16] <dope> hmm
[10:16] <dope> oh wells then
[10:16] <arrenlex> Dope: as you can see I run KDE but both kwrite (KDE) and gaim (GTK) look the same. http://arrenlex.diff.be/screenshots/28519.png
[10:16] <dope> hmm
[10:16] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Sweet jesus, that is so obnoxious xD I could never work on that.
[10:16] <barata> it's just a setting issue; or maybe that gnome & kde have their own font's collection
[10:16] <barata> those kind of stuffs
[10:17] <rausb0> i guess when selecting a theme in kde, it also affects the gtk theme settings
[10:17] <dope> i think it's my default fonts
[10:17] <rausb0> so that could be why xchat looks different when run in kde
[10:17] <skillet> go to the control center or kcontrol and mess with thte gtk-qt settings
[10:17] <dope> the letters are slim
[10:17] <barata> also in fluxbox ... like what I'm doing now
=== cyzie_ is now known as cyzie
[10:17] <rausb0> skillet: yeah, something like that
[10:18] <crystal> can someone help me with a video card driver problem?
[10:18] <Curs0r> arrenlex, the beauty of linux is that it can be so very personal
[10:18] <arrenlex> !someone | crystal
[10:18] <ubotu> crystal: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[10:18] <skillet> The GTK-Qt Theme Engine is a plugin for GTK that allows GTK applications to use Qt widget styles.
[10:18] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Yes! ^__^ As obnoxious as you want it to be.
[10:18] <barata> are you online with your livecd cyzie?
[10:18] <cyzie> barata, no. online using another PC
[10:19] <barata> ok ... can you ACCESS your linux partition on that particular machine where the problem is?
[10:19] <crystal> does anyone know how to install a radeon x200m video card to properly support 3d acceleration?
[10:19] <Curs0r> arrenlex, as you can see, beryl was the answer to all my prayers hahaha
[10:20] <cyzie> barata, yes, what do you need?
[10:20] <arrenlex> Curs0r: Enjoy it. xD
[10:20] <barata> cyzie ... your problem is (1) grub is missing so (2) you cannot get into your linux, right?
[10:21] <cyzie> barata, yes, duirng booting grub stage 1.5, it show the error 17
[10:21] <barata> okey cyzie, now put a live cd and boot with that livecd
[10:21] <khatun> hi, i keep having troubles getting the fglrx driver to work in edgy properly. any better howtos than the one in ubuntu wiki?
[10:21] <barata> like your ubuntu cd/dvd
[10:21] <cyzie> barata, yes, im using ubuntu live CD and it is up now
[10:21] <cyzie> barata, what's next?
[10:21] <barata> okey, then create a mount point, like /hda1
[10:22] <skillet> khatun, what kind of troubles
[10:22] <crystal> khatun, you have the radeon x200m also?
[10:22] <cyzie> barata, done
[10:22] <Nitrolinken> hey
[10:22] <barata> what is your partition type? ext2 ext3 ?
[10:22] <barata> is it in hda1 or hda2?
[10:22] <Nitrolinken> I have a problem with ubuntu..
[10:22] <Nitrolinken> and
[10:23] <barata> then: "mount /dev/hda1 /hda1 -t ext3"
[10:23] <crystal> im trying to get mine to work on kubuntu, but its not cooperating with me
[10:23] <khatun> skillet: well, here's what glxgears -printfps says: "Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"." , "1627 frames in 5.2 seconds = 312.927 FPS"
[10:23] <Nitrolinken> well, I don't get connected to the network
[10:23] <cyzie> barata, ext3, sda5
[10:23] <arrenlex> barata: Don't need to pass the t switch if the type can be autodetected.
[10:23] <khatun> crystal: no, i have Radeon 9600 Pro
[10:23] <cyzie> barata, it has windows xp and debian.
[10:23] <barata> then: "mount /dev/sda5 /hda1 -t ext3"
[10:23] <arrenlex> khatun: Odd. What driver?
[10:23] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: how are you trying to connect?
[10:23] <Nitrolinken> well
[10:23] <barata> you should see your linux in /hda1 now
[10:23] <Nitrolinken> I have an ethernet card
[10:23] <dope> how do i get a terminal window in kde?
[10:24] <cyzie> barata, done
[10:24] <frogzoo> !enter | Nitrolinken
[10:24] <ubotu> Nitrolinken: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[10:24] <Nitrolinken> we have lan in the house
[10:24] <Adlai_> khaije1, are you root or a user?
[10:24] <arrenlex> dope: It's called konsole.
[10:24] <Adlai_> because that was my problem
[10:24] <dope> oh
[10:24] <Adlai_> you have to be a user with ubuntu
[10:24] <skillet> dope, konsole
[10:24] <barata> okey ... now you're ready to chroot ... I'm kind of forget how we normally do that, hold down
[10:24] <dope> got it now
[10:24] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: what is the ethernet card make/model?
[10:24] <khatun> arrenlex: fglrx
[10:24] <arrenlex> khatun: What card?
[10:24] <Adlai_> barata, chroot /path/to/mountpoint /bin/bash
[10:24] <khatun> arrenlex: Radeon 9600 Pro
[10:25] <Adlai_> env-update && source /etc/profile
[10:25] <Adlai_> (on gentoo, anyway)
[10:25] <arrenlex> khatun: Won't work. fglrx only supports radeon > 9800.
[10:25] <cyzie> barata, ???
[10:25] <arrenlex> khatun: You're going to have to use the acceleration in the open-source "radeon" driver.
[10:25] <skillet> ati cards are such a pain in the ass
[10:25] <khatun> arrenlex: really? it has worked great in the past
[10:25] <Nitrolinken> frogzoo: Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC
[10:25] <arrenlex> skillet: They ARE.
[10:25] <arrenlex> khatun: For 3D acceleration? You're sure?
[10:25] <barata> cyzie: I'm reading this: http://gentoo-wiki.com/UsingChroot
[10:25] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: ifconfig |grep eth
[10:25] <khatun> arrenlex: yes, in Dapper
[10:25] <barata> that's right Adlai_
[10:25] <skillet> Nitrolinken, i have a the same chipset
[10:25] <skillet> it works well
[10:26] <cyzie> barata, so what is the command ?
[10:26] <eddiestone> my ubuntu dapper is loging out automatically.. what do I do?
[10:26] <crystal> where can i find the open source drivers?
[10:26] <cyzie> barata, i have mounted the partition
[10:26] <crystal> for ati cards
[10:26] <Adlai_> cyzie, chroot /path/to/mountpoint /bin/bash && env-update && source /etc/profile
[10:26] <barata> chroot /hda1 /bin/bash
[10:26] <arrenlex> khatun: I'm reading the fglrx guide on ubuntu and it says: The model number for your Radeon card is a 9700 pro or above (this includes model numbers that start with an X, like X300, X1600, etc., and it also includes the Xpress 200)
[10:26] <Nitrolinken> yeah. iut's odd. I've had net on it before with ubuntu, but not anymore :( works on the gentoo live-cd anyway =P
[10:26] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: ifconfig |grep eth
[10:26] <Adlai_> I would suggest not using the first &&
[10:26] <arrenlex> khatun: (which means I lied, it's 9700 not 9800, but it doesn't matter.)
[10:26] <Nitrolinken> sorry but, frogzoo? I'm new with linux :(
[10:26] <cyzie> Adlai_, why /bin/bash for ?
[10:26] <arrenlex> khatun: And that is also in keeping with what I've seen on this channel before.
[10:26] <Adlai_> do it as two separate commands or the wrong bash might interpret the second pair of commands
[10:27] <Adlai_> it specifies the shell you want to use
[10:27] <khatun> arrenlex: hmm.. so they've changed it just recently then(?)
[10:27] <barata> to move the bash environment to /hda1
[10:27] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: type that in a terminal, what's it say?
[10:27] <Adlai_> otherwise you'll just be using /bin/sh which is a little uglier
[10:27] <eddiestone> what is the command to upgrade dapper2edgy?
[10:27] <Adlai_> but usable, if you want
[10:27] <arrenlex> !upgrade | eddiestone
[10:27] <ubotu> eddiestone: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[10:27] <cyzie> so barata is the command given by Adlai_ correct?
[10:27] <eddiestone> oh man, I have no browser
[10:27] <arrenlex> khatun: I don't know.
=== tonyy is now known as tonyyarusso
[10:28] <arrenlex> eddiestone: You always have a console browser, it's called w3c :)
[10:28] <khatun> arrenlex: ok, thank you. but i'll keep trying anyway for a while ;)
[10:28] <barata> once you've done it, you're basically already in your original linux environment ... not in the livecd anymore
[10:28] <rausb0> arrenlex: w3m
[10:28] <eddiestone> lynx
[10:28] <cyzie> so barata is the command given by Adlai_ correct?
[10:28] <barata> yes cyzie
[10:28] <eddiestone> thanks
[10:28] <arrenlex> rausb0: c almost looks like m if you squint, right? xD
[10:28] <barata> try to ls your home, can you see your files?
[10:28] <rausb0> arrenlex: :)
[10:28] <arrenlex> khatun: Is there any reason that the radeon driver won't satisfy you?
[10:28] <eddiestone> arrenlex: could you repeat that url?
[10:29] <barata> just 'ls /home' though, not 'ls /hda1/home'
[10:29] <cyzie> <Adlai_> cyzie, chroot /path/to/mountpoint /bin/bash && env-update && source /etc/profile  // i dont have env-update
[10:29] <eddiestone> arrenlex: nevermind! thanks
[10:29] <arrenlex> eddiestone: If you don't have a GUI it won't help you much because the update manager is graphical.
[10:29] <Adlai> cyzie, chroot /path/to/mountpoint
[10:29] <khatun> arrenlex: the fglrx used to be 2x+ faster in 3d acceleration
[10:29] <Adlai> then try env-update && source /etc/profile
[10:29] <arrenlex> khatun: *shrug* you know what you need.
[10:29] <cyzie> adlia env -update, NOT env-update
[10:29] <cyzie> ..........
[10:30] <barata> Adlai: he doesnt need profile because the current profile is the livecd's
[10:30] <Adlai> cyzie, I come from gentoo, where it's a little different, sorry
[10:30] <cyzie> barata, Adlai k guys, im rebooting now
[10:30] <Adlai> good luck
[10:30] <cyzie> thanks Adlai
[10:30] <barata> ok, you should see your grub back
[10:30] <cyzie> thanks barata
[10:30] <dope> how do i change my volume?  i can't find a volume control in kde
[10:30] <barata> is it back?
[10:31] <cyzie> :(
[10:31] <skillet> dope kmixer
[10:31] <cyzie> still error 17
[10:31] <barata> okey ... because you just chroot and didnt fix the grub!
[10:31] <dope> where's that
[10:31] <barata> do it all over again, but this time fix the grub and put it back in the mbr
[10:31] <skillet> barata, isnt there a way to fix grub when you boot the cd? or was that on the alternate cd? can't remember
[10:32] <cyzie> barata, okie. booting the live cd
[10:32] <barata> chroot skillet
[10:32] <crystal> can someone help me get the fglrx installed properly or direct me to another how to or possibly even the open source ati drivers?
[10:32] <Adlai> crystal, do you have adept?
[10:32] <arrenlex> cyzie: I googled: Grub error 17 : Cannot mount selected partition. This error is returned if the partition requested exists, but the filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB.
[10:32] <barata> because if grub is screwed up, you just cannot enter windows or linux
[10:32] <crystal> yes i do
[10:32] <ArCHoNKoG> can someone help me with this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37305/
[10:32] <arrenlex> cyzie: Which begs the question: you're sure your filesystems are correct?
[10:32] <Adlai> go to that
[10:32] <Adlai> and search for fglrx
[10:33] <skillet> barata, right i know you can do it that way but you have to know what you are doing... thus why you are in the conversation that you are in
[10:33] <skillet> dope, i believe it is in multimedia
[10:33] <kleinlappies> i have a nat problem in azureus. does anyone know what i must do?
[10:33] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Could you please run "sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/coreutils_5.96-5ubuntu4_amd64.deb" and paste the error you get here?
[10:33] <kleinlappies> i use firestarter
[10:33] <ubox> hey all
[10:33] <Adlai> you'll want fglrx-kernel-<your version> and xorg-driver-fglrx
[10:33] <Adlai> crystal, ^^
[10:33] <skillet> everytime you download music from the internet God kills a kitten
[10:34] <ubox> help needed for pop configuration
[10:34] <Adlai> kleinlappies, you go to the azureus website and read their faqs
[10:34] <arrenlex> skillet: If by God you mean RIAA and by kitten you mean a random young girl or grandmother, then yes.
[10:34] <barata> cyzie: read this grub stuffs: http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=975
[10:34] <skillet> arrenlex, lol
[10:34] <barata> skillet, he needed to put his grub back to the mbr
[10:35] <kleinlappies> arrenlex, k. will do that. was at ubuntu forums but to no avail. thanks
[10:35] <sacater> does anyone know how i change the default media player in firefox
[10:35] <Adlai> crystal, once you have those, I'll give you a list of things you need to do before I take a very very late bedtime
[10:35] <sacater> i want to change it to vlc media plater
[10:35] <sacater> i want to change it to vlc media player*
[10:35] <skillet> barata, sorry i didnt mean to hijack anything i did come in on the middle of that and i apologize
[10:35] <barata> it's all right skillet
[10:35] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37306/ here it goes
[10:35] <crystal> ok i have the list
[10:35] <Adlai> alright
[10:35] <sonicGB> ubox: what's your issue?
[10:36] <Adlai> first thing, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf so that whatever Device section your screen is asking for has Driver "fglrx" in it
[10:36] <sacater> how do i change the default media player in firefox
[10:36] <Nitro> frogzoo: it gave this eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:17:31:2F:4D:1C
[10:36] <cyzie> barata, do u want to see my fdisk -l ?
[10:36] <Adlai> then kill X (log out and go to console)
[10:36] <skillet> Nitro, lsmod | grep 8139too
[10:36] <Adlai> rmmod fglrx && modprobe fglrx
[10:36] <skillet> see what you get with that
[10:36] <barata> never fdisk anything cyzie
[10:36] <Adlai> and then start X again (initscript or startx)
[10:36] <ubox> am setting up pop on my machine for lan
[10:36] <barata> it's dangerous
[10:36] <Adlai> it should work after that
[10:37] <cyzie> barata, fdisk -l just show the partition.
[10:37] <Adlai> to test, as user, run "glxinfo | grep -i render"
[10:37] <Adlai> it should tell you that direct rendering is on
[10:37] <Adlai> oh, one other thing
[10:37] <skillet> ubox, howtoforge.com
[10:37] <barata> basically cyzie, you only need to (1) chroot and (2) grub-install
[10:37] <Adlai> in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:37] <barata> that's it
[10:37] <rausb0> Nitro: do you have to reboot into linux in order to check those commands?
[10:37] <Adlai> you need to disable compositing
[10:37] <Adlai> I'll /msg you that
[10:37] <barata> and your grub must be back again
[10:37] <Nitro> yes
[10:37] <Nitro> but I'll
[10:37] <Nitro> get the other laptop up with mirc so that I won't
[10:37] <rausb0> Nitro: then maybe its better to give you a longer list :)
[10:38] <Nitro> :P
[10:38] <frogzoo> Nitro: can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces ?
[10:38] <Nitro> from windows?
[10:38] <Adlai> whether or not you have to disable compositing depends on what card you have, but to make sure you get the driver working with hardware rendering, it's best to disable it first
[10:38] <Adlai> and then if you really want compositing you can fool around from there
[10:38] <frogzoo> Nitro: your nick is working, you just need to configure /etc/network/interfaces for eth0 properly
[10:38] <Adlai> good?
[10:38] <rausb0> Nitro: first things first: do you have a dhcp server on your local net?
[10:38] <ubox> sonicG8: do i have to make my machine as dns?
[10:38] <cyzie> barata, done chroot, now what?
[10:39] <Nitro> I think it is
[10:39] <barata> read: http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=975
[10:39] <barata> it;s about installing grub
[10:39] <rausb0> Nitro: in windows, open cmd.exe and type in: ipconfig
[10:39] <Flannel> !grub | cyzie, first link tells how to install grub:
[10:39] <ubotu> cyzie, first link tells how to install grub:: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:39] <barata> cyzie, if you 'ls /home' now can you see your files?
[10:39] <Adlai> well I hope that works for you because I am very tired
[10:39] <ubox> coz the error its giving is Host lookup failed: pop.x.x: Name or service not known
[10:39] <rausb0> Nitro: there you should see the ip settings
[10:39] <Adlai> good night #ubuntu
[10:39] <crystal> ive done all that i appeciate the help
[10:39] <cyzie> barata, yes i can see my files
[10:40] <Nitro> Maybe I should try set up a static IP using that?
[10:40] <jareth_> !grub-install
[10:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about grub-install - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:40] <barata> that's good! That means that now your root is already in your partition environment!
[10:40] <rausb0> Nitro: not necessarily. if dhcp works, it is much easier.
[10:40] <Adlai> crystal, if it doesn't work after that it's probably a problem with your kernel version not matching up with the fglrx module version
[10:40] <barata> now you only have to grub-install again
[10:40] <Adlai> restarting into a command prompt may or may not help you there
[10:40] <cyzie> barata, how ?
[10:40] <Nitro> rausb0: that's the problem, that's what it's set on ubuntu
[10:40] <barata> I forget ... :( read the links: http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=975
[10:41] <rausb0> Nitro: what is set in ubuntu? fixed ip address or dhcp?

[10:41] <skillet> rausb0 wtf is that
[10:41] <ubox> sonicG8: i have edited .fetchmailrc but my only quetsion is whether i should make my machine as a dns?

[10:42] <skillet> haha
[10:42] <barata> no '
[10:42] <skillet> oh man
[10:42] <rausb0> well, its also the inferface name of ralink usb wlan cards, but thats another story
[10:42] <sonicGB> as a dns.... not, not unless you have a specific need for a local dns
[10:42] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Yes, hold on, I'm thinking.
[10:42] <Nitro> rausb0? any ideas?
[10:42] <sonicGB> ubox: I do have a dns on the box I run fetchmail from, but I don't really need to
[10:42] <cedric30> I have removed the directory /usr/lib/dri How could I repare this???
[10:42] <barata> if it says 'succeeded' .. you are done, then exit from the root, exit again and reboot
[10:42] <rausb0> Nitro: write down the settings that the ipconfig command in windows tells you
[10:43] <Nitro> and set a fixed ip?
[10:43] <cedric30> there is only ATI drivers in this directory???
[10:43] <ubox> sonicG8: oh ok
[10:43] <sonicGB> ubox: is your fetchmail config working OK for you?
[10:43] <rausb0> Nitro: that would be ip address, subnet mask, gateway address and dns server address
[10:43] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Download this to a temporary directory: http://arrenlex.diff.be/preinst
[10:43] <Nitro> yeah :)
[10:43] <cyzie> barata, can you type my name before u tell me the message. i barely see your message, or can we PM ?
[10:43] <Nitro> I'll try that
[10:43] <Nitro> bais
[10:43] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Run it as "sudo sh -x preinst". There should be quite a lot of output. Pastebin it all.
[10:43] <rausb0> nitro: i wasnt finished yet...

[10:49] <skillet> *sigh* one of these days flash and linux will love each other
[10:49] <ArCHoNKoG> what do you mean
[10:49] <frogzoo> skillet: flash 9 is the shizzle
[10:49] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: That is a command:  "file /var/lib/dpkg/diversions"
[10:50] <skillet> yea tell that do ff and opera
[10:50] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Enter it in your terminal. Paste output.
[10:50] <skillet> they hate it... at least on my system
[10:50] <skillet> do = to
[10:50] <cyzie> barata, got error, can i paste u the error in Private Message?
[10:50] <cyzie> barata, got error, can i paste u the error in Private Message?
[10:50] <barata> go ahead
[10:50] <frogzoo> skillet: ff 2.0 on edgy ?
[10:50] <Slart> mm, same here.. 64 bit ubuntu and flash is not getting along
[10:50] <skillet> yes sir
[10:50] <cyzie> barata, u got it ?
[10:50] <arrenlex> Slart: Not surprised. You can't run flash on 64-bit ubuntu natively.
[10:50] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, /var/lib/dpkg/diversions: ERROR: cannot open `/var/lib/dpkg/diversions' (No such file or directory)
[10:50] <barata> yes cyzie
[10:51] <frogzoo> skillet: oh, 64bit might be problematic
[10:51] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Aha! That is your problem. :)
[10:51] <Slart> arrenlex: oh, but you can.. the latest standalone beta works great... but not the plugin
[10:51] <skillet> i have a amd64 but im running 32 version of ubuntu,.... too many damn problems with amd64 right now
[10:51] <thesand> OK- I've got a pretty stupid question. Which image is being referred to when they use the term "splash screen"?
[10:51] <arrenlex> Slart: That beta is 32-bit, and amd64 can also execute 32-bit. However, in the context of a 64-bit browser, it cannot work.
[10:52] <barata> cyzie, do again (1) grub (2) root (hd0,4) (3) find /boot/grub/stage1
[10:52] <frogzoo> thesand: well it might be the grub splash, or the gnome splash
[10:52] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, what are my options then
[10:52] <arrenlex> Slart: So the standalone will work because of 32-bit emulation, but you're not running it within a 64-bit fox anytime soon.
[10:52] <dope> ok i don't like kde anymore i wanna go back to gnome
[10:52] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Hold on, I'm arguing and\or looking up something for you. :)
[10:52] <arrenlex> dope: xD traitor!
[10:52] <skillet> dope... haha
[10:52] <skillet> why
[10:52] <dope> when i try to boot into gnome everything is just black
[10:52] <cyzie> barata, done.
[10:52] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, alright thanks man
[10:52] <dope> skillet, cause i can't get media to work in firefox
[10:52] <skillet> not so good for you!
[10:52] <thesand> The Gnome Splash- I just installed the Gnome Splash Screen Preferences - but I'm not sure which image it is referring to.
[10:52] <barata> cyzie: no error?
[10:52] <ubox> sonicG8: sent
[10:52] <Slart> arrenlex:  ah... ok then.. let me rephrase =)... the standalone beta player (32 bit) works great =)
[10:52] <dope> and i can't find my volume controller
[10:53] <cyzie> yes, no error for (1) (2) (3)
[10:53] <skillet> kmixer?
[10:53] <cyzie> barata, nv try setup (hd0,4) yet
[10:53] <skillet> hrm
[10:53] <Slart> arrenlex: and here I was hoping a functional 64bit flash plugin wasn't far away... *sob*
[10:53] <arrenlex> Slart: Yeah, which is what I'm telling you.
[10:53] <thesand> Is it the graphic that shows metacity, nautilus, etc, loading when I first login?
[10:53] <dope> couldn't find kmixer
[10:53] <frogzoo> thesand: sys -> admin -> login window
[10:53] <wenko> dope: I had that problem...My video card was out of the scope of my monitor...the only way to deal with it is to try a diff monitor OR edit ur configs
[10:53] <cyzie> barata, nv try setup (hd4) yet
[10:53] <wenko> biab
[10:53] <arrenlex> Slart: No, because your player is 32-bit and the plugin must be 64. xD
[10:53] <dope> i just want gnome back :(
[10:53] <skillet> i just switched to gnome... i used kde for like 6 years
[10:54] <barata> okey cyzie, try it 'setup (hd0,4)
[10:54] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Hmm. Try this: "sudo touch /var/lib/dpkg/diversions"
[10:54] <barata> if that works
[10:54] <dope> well my gnome is black
[10:54] <dope> the ubuntu loading thing doesn't even come up
[10:54] <cyzie> barata, failed
[10:54] <frogzoo> !art-manager | thesand

[10:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about art-manager - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:54] <skillet> dont be racist!
[10:54] <arrenlex> skillet: Traitor!!! KDE is the God unto you all!
[10:54] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, alright
[10:54] <frogzoo> !gnome-art | thesand
[10:54] <thesand> OK- thanks!
[10:54] <ubotu> gnome-art: install GNOME themes from art.gnome.org. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2-3 (edgy), package size 26 kB, installed size 200 kB
[10:54] <barata> cyzie, try 'setup (hd4)'
[10:54] <Slart> arrenlex: well.. I hope I can show my grandkids the new 64 bit flash plugin at least =)
[10:54] <cyzie> barata, setup(hd4) failed, but setup (hd0,4) successfully ;)
[10:54] <khatun> arrenlex: just so you know, got it working now :)
[10:54] <arrenlex> Slart: They will probably be using it to play Duke Nukem Forever.
[10:54] <zak> dope: one of my stoned friends got chased by a black midget once
[10:54] <barata> okey ... if it;s successful then you're done!
[10:55] <Slart> arrenlex: indeed
[10:55] <dope> :|
[10:55] <barata> just exit and exit again and reboot cyzie

[11:02] <cyzie> barata, use ktorrent for what ?
[11:02] <skillet> ktorrent is pretty cool
[11:02] <barata> cyzie, what is important is just dont do stupid things like fdisk or cfdisk that will erase your dear files
[11:02] <Protocol2> arrenlex, thx
[11:03] <barata> cyzie: ktorrent for downloading a pirated windoz
[11:03] <enyc> U seem to have all sorts of trouble with edcy console -- keyboard nub/caps lights dont work and capslock seems to activate shif for nuwber keys etc.  -- not just uppercase letters!
[11:03] <barata> cyzie: and also do NOT recover your Windoz with Dell's stuffs ... because the same, it's just gonna erase your things/data
[11:03] <cyzie> barata, let's assume i have windows xp professsional edition now, what do i do next?
[11:03] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Whoa, your system is screwed up. I've never seen that error before.
[11:03] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: What have you done?! *thwap*
[11:04] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: What would happen if you run "apt-get install --reinstall dpkg"?
[11:04] <Nitro> back again. still, no net
[11:04] <rausb0> Nitro: you left MUCH too early
[11:04] <barata> cyzie: if you have a bootable windoz, what I WOULD do with your problem is to fixmbr ... that allows me to boot into XP; then once it is done, I'll fix the grub
[11:04] <Almindor> hey guys
[11:04] <arrenlex> !hi
[11:04] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[11:04] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex,  it reinstalled it thats all
[11:04] <skillet> hey hey
[11:05] <Almindor> is there a repos. somewhere with the new nvidia driver?
[11:05] <Nitro> I'm on a laptp now... :/ well..
[11:05] <barata> cyzie: I'm just SPECULATING ... I might be wrong .... that is your MBR is fucked up by Vista ... that is a well known shit because I was there too
[11:05] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: now run "sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/debianutils_2.16.2_amd64.deb" again...
[11:05] <Almindor> I have old amaranth's beta (for beryl) but I understand the new release now has support for that
[11:05] <rausb0> Nitro: so you dont have to reboot now to try linux commands?
[11:05] <Nitro> no
[11:05] <rausb0> Nitro: good.
[11:05] <skillet> barata, vista was never installed... due to lack of disk space
[11:05] <Nitro> indeed =P
[11:05] <cyzie> barata, right, i have windows xp home editoin from friend. okay, what i see from your advice is that, 1. run commmand prompt. 2. type fixmbr 3. ???
[11:05] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, it worked long story on how this system is screwed up
[11:05] <barata> skillet: he did try!
[11:05] <Amaranth> !nvidia9 | Almindor

[11:10] <Nitro> rausb0: srry, but what name? :(
[11:10] <Almindor> Amaranth, where can I get the keys?
[11:10] <frogzoo> rausb0: it's eth0
[11:10] <rausb0> frogzoo: how can you be sure?
[11:10] <Nitro> forgzoo: I tried dhpc, it goes to a router, but not working
[11:10] <Amaranth> Almindor: I don't know
[11:10] <Amaranth> Almindor: and 9629 is not beta
[11:10] <arrenlex> cedric30: Did you install a kernel that is not from the ubuntu repositories?
[11:11] <frogzoo> rausb0: Nitro | frogzoo: it gave this eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:17:31:2F:4D:1C
[11:11] <netcrash> Hello , how can I rebuild the file sources.list with new locations ?
[11:11] <rausb0> frogzoo: ah okay
[11:11] <Amaranth> Almindor: although i think the repo actually has 9631, i don't maintain it
[11:11] <Nitro> oh that name :$

[11:11] <frogzoo> Nitro: now for the 3rd time, please pastebin /etc/network/interfaces
[11:12] <Nitro> frogzoo: ...
[11:12] <nemanja> Hi
[11:12] <skillet> hi
[11:12] <sonicGB> source o matic only has breezy, dapper, edgy and no version numbers... how on earth am I supposed to map code names to actual version numbers?
[11:12] <frogzoo> !pastebin | Nitro
[11:12] <ubotu> Nitro: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:13] <nemanja> how are you
[11:13] <jareth_> why is gnome-art so heavy on my cpu?
[11:13] <skillet> oh im good. how about yourself
[11:13] <Nitro> yes, but what am I gonna pastebin?
[11:13] <raid_> hello I have a question> i run ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS and i have gnucash 1.8, it seems I can't update to 2.0.3 from synaptic, do I have to install ubuntu 6.10 in order to have gnucash 2.0.3 installed?
[11:13] <frogzoo> Nitro: now for the 3rd time, please pastebin /etc/network/interfaces
[11:13] <skillet> Nitro, cat /etc/network/interfaces
[11:13] <arrenlex> raid_: Yes. Dapper will not receive new versions. Only bugfixes.
[11:13] <Nitro> ok
[11:13] <jareth_> it uses 39.2 % cpu while downloading background pics?
[11:14] <ver0niqu3> hi all
[11:14] <raid_> arrenlex is that the only way to have nucas 2.0 ???
[11:14] <ubox> do i have to set ip addrress range in .fetchmailrc when i am setting pop for LAN?
[11:14] <raid_> gnucash
[11:14] <rausb0> Nitro: you definitely need some command line knowledge
[11:14] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, i made it back
[11:14] <arrenlex> raid_: Of course not. You can compile from source if you like.
[11:14] <netcrash> !hashkey | netcrash
[11:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hashkey - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:14] <ver0niqu3> i've installer xgl with beryl on ubuntu edgy with ati radeon, radeon drivers works....beryl works....but when i open the xgl session it start by default with compiz then i've to click on emerald and select beryl. is it posible to set by defaul beryl?
[11:14] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Glad to see you on here.
[11:14] <ver0niqu3> installed*
[11:14] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: Survived? xD
[11:14] <netcrash> How can I check witch is my hash key ?
[11:14] <ArCHoNKoG> arrenlex, thanks again for the help
[11:15] <raid_> arrenlex that sounds like too hard for me, anyway thx
[11:15] <arrenlex> ArCHoNKoG: No problem... although I'm very curious just what on earth you did to your poor system.
[11:16] <Nitro> rausb0: wow, you don't say so.
[11:16] <jareth_> me is wondering why art-manager is built using ruby, which is quite heavy on cpu load....
[11:16] <kraut> moin
[11:17] <rausb0> Nitro: anyway, pastebin the file frogzoo told you
[11:17] <Nitro> yeah
[11:18] <ppd> hi, how can I print odt and doc files directly from the console?
[11:19] <rausb0> .oO(i wonder why he had to go offline for that..)
[11:19] <checkmate> does anyone have any insight as to why sometimes my onboard audio is dev/dsp, and sometimes it's dev/dsp1?
[11:19] <checkmate> i just shut down and booted back up
[11:19] <checkmate> and it changed
[11:19] <checkmate> it switches back and forth randomly it seems
[11:20] <jens> Hi everybody
[11:20] <frogzoo> checkmate: onboard sound card?
[11:20] <EvilGuru> What can I use to open .chm files?
[11:21] <barata> xchm
[11:21] <Infeliz> pray help from god
[11:22] <jens> I have a small problem with Edgy on my notebookt: whenever the screensaver kicks in the screen goes blank but does _not_ turn off, i.e. no power savings. I tried "xset s dpms force off/standby/suspend" and these commands all turn the screen off, so I don't know why g-p-m doesn't do that. I also tried setting these values in /apps/gnome-power-manager  in gconf-editor, to no avail.  Any ideas?
[11:22] <afflux> is there any way to install an ubuntu linux from a running damn small linux?
[11:23] <jens> EvilGuru, xchm or the KDE Help viewer
[11:23] <EvilGuru> jens: thanks
[11:24] <jens> EvilGrin, for KDE you need to install kdevelop I think, it has the necessary converter
[11:24] <jens> EvilGrin, and xchm doesn't do most fonts (just default ones) so it'll work but not be pretty, last time I looked that is
[11:25] <leor> .quit
[11:25] <barata> do /quit
[11:25] <ubox> is pop.gmail.com not working..coz its showing me connection timed out
=== rausb0 is now known as rausb1
[11:27] <Curs0r> omg i just ate half a pumpkin pie
=== rausb1 is now known as rausb0
[11:27] <rausb0> Nitro: why did you go offline?
[11:27] <jens> Curs0r, leftovers from thanksgiving? :)
[11:27] <jens> Curs0r, about time..
[11:28] <Curs0r> no i just drove to the store, bought a pie, came home, and ate half of it
[11:28] <whyz> hey.. very basic question. I'm not familiar with apt. How do i check if a specific package is installed?
[11:28] <rausb0> Nitro: you needed the notebook to use pastebin and the linux box to read the contents of /etc/network/interfaces
[11:28] <ubox> oops didn't tick SSL option
[11:28] <ubox> its ok now
[11:29] <Nitro> raus0: I went offline cause y usb dropped out
[11:29] <proqesi> is it ok to install *.i386.deb ubuntu packages on my amd64 system?
[11:29] <ubox> whyz: choose synaptic, its a gui for apt
[11:29] <LinuxHelp> How can I check the what udma mode I'm using on my /dev/sda ?
[11:29] <rausb0> Nitro: usb? why do you need usb for going online?
[11:29] <proqesi> rausb0: usb modem maybe?
[11:30] <nearfar> I am trying to install edgy (gui installer).
[11:30] <rausb0> proqesi: i hope not
[11:30] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, using udma on scsi?
[11:30] <whyz> ubox, thanks, but i want it in console :)
[11:30] <nearfar> it hung up at the step 'scanning the mirror'
[11:30] <nearfar> what to do? :/
[11:30] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, sata in fact
[11:30] <ct12am> Can I install ubuntu from the iso without burning it?
[11:30] <ct12am> I'm in a chicken/egg bind
[11:30] <rausb0> proqesi: usb modems using proprietary shit protocols
[11:30] <ubox> whyz: sudo apt-cache search <packagename>
[11:30] <Curs0r> i thought sata didn't do udma
[11:31] <ct12am> Can I upgrade from Debian to Ubuntu with apt? ha ha ha
[11:31] <Curs0r> hence the whole sata 150/300 thing
[11:31] <Nitrolinken> btw, I have ms 2000
[11:31] <rausb0> Nitrolinken: whatever that is
[11:32] <ct12am> I ahhh...I am going to burn a cd now, nevermind Internet land
[11:32] <Pennywise_> how do i install .patch files?
[11:32] <proqesi> ct12am: no
[11:32] <ct12am> ha
[11:32] <ct12am> cool
[11:32] <ct12am> thanks dude
[11:32] <ct12am> I'm real!
[11:32] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, I'm sure I've check the udma settings on my hard drives before, I think they were actually 100 (i think thats udma4) and 133 (i think thats udma5)
[11:32] <Nitrolinken> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37319/
[11:32] <LinuxHelp> LinuxHelp, I've tried hdparm, but its not giving me any useful info
[11:32] <x-r00t-x> hello .i got problem with cpu usage . 1st cpu 100% and 2nd cpu 50% loaded on standby
[11:33] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, now how on earth did you get a sata drive to do udma 100?
[11:33] <LinuxHelp> lol at me talking to myself
[11:33] <rausb0> Nitrolinken: looks okay. its a bit strange the "auto eth0" line is the last one but it doesnt matter
[11:33] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, it came that way
[11:34] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: add the line "auto eth0" above eth0, & 'sudo ifup eth0'
[11:34] <rausb0> frogzoo: auto eth0 is there
[11:34] <rausb0> frogzoo: at the end of the file
[11:34] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, either that, or I'm going mad
[11:34] <Paladine> anyone awake?
[11:34] <frogzoo> rausb0: oh yes
[11:34] <rausb0> frogzoo: do you think the order of that lines matters?
[11:34] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, well in the event that a sata drive were operating in udma mode i would imagine it would be 133
[11:35] <Paladine> k anyone help me with a permissions issue?
[11:35] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, that just doesn't sound right though, is your bios providing some type of emulation?
[11:35] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, hmm
[11:35] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, nope
[11:36] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, I think I just probably left out dma support in the kernel or something, I change kernels quick and see what happens
[11:36] <klaus> Hello, my digikam cannot download from the cam, gphoto2 can, but only as root ... any Idea?
[11:36] <frogzoo> rausb0: don't think so but maybe, 1st to check though is autoneg settings
[11:36] <HuibertGill> !ask  | Paladine
[11:36] <ubotu> Paladine: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:36] <Nitrolinken> frogzoo: he gives back unable to lookup lan by gethost....
[11:37] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: 'sudo apt-get install mii-tools'
[11:37] <Curs0r> well i'm looking at someone's random kernel output that show sata interfaces being interpreted at 133 but they aren't actually udma
[11:37] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: 'sudo apt-get install net-tools'  soz
[11:37] <Paladine> ok I added myself to the www-data group so I could manage files in the webtree without having to chown or sudo all the time
[11:37] <rausb0> Nitrolinken: does ping 139.174.2.5 work?
[11:37] <Paladine> I have rebooted to restart my PAM session
[11:37] <Paladine> `id` shows the following

[11:38] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: oh nvm, you can't install stuff while your net's down :(
[11:38] <Paladine> so you can see 33(www-data) identifies me as a member of that group

[11:38] <Paladine> when I try and delete that file
[11:38] <Nitrolinken> rausb0: I'll try
[11:38] <Paladine> I get permission denied
[11:39] <HuibertGill> Paladine: to delete a file, the user or group must have write permission un the directory
[11:39] <x-r00t-x> Paladine,  use root

[11:40] <klaus>  gphoto2 can download images from the cam, but only as root ... any Idea how a user can download with gphoto2?
[11:40] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: try: 'sudo ifdown eth0 ; sudo ifup eth0 '
[11:40] <Paladine> x-r00t-x, if you don't have an answer don't try
[11:40] <HuibertGill> Paladine: nit the file perm . the directory of the file "."
[11:40] <HuibertGill> *not
[11:41] <Nitrolinken> frogzoo: both get same message
[11:42] <HuibertGill> Paladine: changing a file requires the file permisions, deleteing a file alters the directory structure, not the file it self
[11:42] <Paladine> HuibertGill, k you were correct the parent directory didn't have write permission
[11:42] <Paladine> thanks its been bugging me for 20 minutes
[11:42] <HuibertGill> Paladine: I know :-)
[11:43] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: ping localhost

[11:43] <ArIdA> hello everybody, does anyone knows what package I have to download to be able to see .mpg and .mpeg files?
[11:43] <LinuxHelp> I suppose I want to know what generated them.

[11:46] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, not the most bizarre thing i ever saw
[11:46] <LinuxHelp> or, sda is udma5 and sdb is udma6
[11:47] <proqesi> serioussven: firefox plugins can be installed with synaptic or aptitude
[11:47] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, pretty weird though
[11:48] <futzilogik> Can anyone help me with this? --> "Sound Juicer could not extract this CD. Reason: Could not link pipeline"
[11:48] <serioussven> proqesi: I know, but when I use mplayer svn synaptic doesn't mark mplayer as being installed so I can't just install the plugin without installing mplayer for the second time destroying the installation...
[11:48] <futzilogik> I'm trying the preconfigured wave profile
[11:48] <LinuxHelp> Curs0r, do you have any idea what generated those two files? Its not hdparm I dont think.
[11:49] <proqesi> serioussven: it would mark it as installed if you used checkinstall to install the package you built
[11:49] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, when you run cat against a device like that it gets it's info from /proc i believe
[11:50] <Curs0r> much like /cat/proc/cpuinfo gives you the full rundown on that yada yada
[11:50] <serioussven> proqesi, how do I use the command? the wiki talks about using auto-apt for simple packages
[11:51] <proqesi> serioussven: sudo checkinstall make install
[11:51] <proqesi> serioussven: or whatever the install command is
[11:51] <serioussven> ok
[11:51] <mindspin> hi, I get this error message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37323/ where do I set my language (on console)?
[11:51] <serioussven> proqesi, another thing learned :) thanks
[11:51] <frogzoo> LinuxHelp: those are 'hdparm -I /dev/xxx'
[11:51] <Curs0r> LinuxHelp, i see your drive has oth sets of instructions
[11:51] <Curs0r> both*
[11:52] <Curs0r> my brain is fried i must sleep
[11:52] <Curs0r> night people
[11:52] <LinuxHelp> Yup, hdparm -I it is
[11:53] <markus_nagler> hello, I'm looking for help with the synaptic package manager
[11:55] <markus_nagler> anyone?
[11:55] <proqesi> markus_nagler: ask your question
[11:56] <Nitrolinken> frogzoo: it returns blank
[11:56] <markus_nagler> alright, the thing is, my snaptic package manager freezes up if I try to modify the preferences. apt-get works fine, synaptic pm works fine, it's just the preferences
[11:56] <LinuxHelp> I am just wondering, what Curs0r meant when he said "your drive has both sets of instructions" http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/5AqWU424.html
[11:56] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, what do you need help with
[11:56] <HuibertGill> mindspin: I think it is "sudo dpkg-reconfigure localeconf"
[11:56] <markus_nagler> is there a way of 'zapping' the preferences like under Mac OS?
[11:57] <HuibertGill> !locales
[11:57] <ubotu> To set up and configure your locales, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LocaleConf
[11:57] <Alakazamz0r> <markus_nagler> what happens when you click preferences?
[11:57] <Zodiac`> when i try to install ubuntu i get something like this error: "Could not get enough free space for ubuntu" :/
[11:57] <markus_nagler> they open.
[11:57] <Alakazamz0r> ok, so whats the problem?
[11:57] <klaus> hello?  gphoto2 can download images from the cam, but only as root ... any Idea how a user can download with gphoto2?
[11:58] <proqesi> markus_nagler: sounds like you should file a bug. you might want to delete the existing preferences file and see if the problem goes away
[11:58] <markus_nagler> well, when I try to close them, with or without modifications, the whole synaptic PM freezes up
[11:58] <markus_nagler> @proquesi: yes, that's what I wanted to do. Where is the preference file?
[11:58] <Zodiac`> when i try to install ubuntu i get something like this error: "Could not get enough free space for ubuntu" :/
[11:59] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, freezes up for how long?
[11:59] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, are you running it as root?
[11:59] <markus_nagler> I haven't tried beyond something like 5 minutes. Should I?
[11:59] <Alakazamz0r> yes.
[11:59] <Alakazamz0r> gksudo synaptic
[11:59] <Alakazamz0r> type that
[11:59] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: 'sudo -i ; echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" > /etc/hosts"
[11:59] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: NO!!!
[11:59] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: 'sudo -i ; echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" >> /etc/hosts"
[11:59] <Nitrolinken> ok
[12:00] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: now correct
[12:00] <markus_nagler> @Alakazamz0r: through 'sudo'
[12:00] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, once again
[12:00] <Alakazamz0r> gksudo synaptic
[12:00] <Alakazamz0r> just like that
[12:01] <markus_nagler> on it. just a moment
[12:01] <mindspin> HuibertGill: dpkg-reconfigure shows no effect, I get the same error
[12:01] <Alakazamz0r> ok markus_nagler
[12:01] <Alakazamz0r> mindspin, care to explain your problem one more time... i can probably help.
[12:01] <Zodiac`> when i try to install ubuntu i get something like this error: "Could not get enough free space for ubuntu" :/ After i choosed to partition my hdd
[12:02] <frogzoo> Zodiac`: is this a trick question?
[12:02] <Alakazamz0r> lol
[12:02] <proqesi> Zodiac`: are you installing in addition to windows?
[12:02] <Alakazamz0r> proqesi, yes he is
[12:02] <Alakazamz0r> obviously.
=== quuxo is now known as quux
[12:02] <markus_nagler> there we go. Clicked the terminal button (second row from bottom) in preferences, hit apply and the windows turn blank (i.e. just basic outlines). App stops responding
[12:02] <Zodiac`> proqesi, im installing on an hdd with windows
[12:02] <Zodiac`> and i want to dualboot
[12:02] <proqesi> Zodiac`: you should have Windows do disk cleanup, and throw away as many files as you can in Windows, then try again
[12:02] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, and you did "gksudo synaptic" ?
[12:03] <markus_nagler> I'm fairly certain I meesed it up when wrangling with the JRE last night
[12:03] <mindspin> Alakazamz0r: ok: after updateing hal, my keyboard did not work correct anymore, I needed to push every button for about a second to show up. I fixed this by editing xorg.conf
=== fop is now known as Gnorksy
[12:03] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, synaptic isnt java based.
[12:03] <proqesi> Zodiac`: or look for another hard drive to attach to your computer
[12:03] <markus_nagler> @Alakazamz0r: yes
[12:03] <Zodiac`> proqesi: defragmate thingy? (tryed to translate from norwegian :P)
[12:03] <mindspin> but now my language settings are messed up. I have no german charset at konsole, and only some with x apps
[12:03] <proqesi> Zodiac`: something like that, yes
[12:03] <Alakazamz0r> mindspin, " I fixed this by editing xorg.conf"
[12:03] <markus_nagler> I know, but I got some errors, had to run stuff from the command line to get Synaptic to work again
[12:03] <Alakazamz0r> so its fixed?
[12:03] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, ok lemme think here.
[12:04] <Alakazamz0r> markus_nagler, is your system up to date?
[12:04] <proqesi> markus_nagler: what are the errors?
[12:04] <Zodiac`> proqesi, thanks :D
[12:04] <Zodiac`> im doing it now ;)
[12:04] <markus_nagler> @proquesi: how would i know?
[12:04] <mindspin> perl is ranting about languages
[12:04] <proqesi> markus_nagler: just describe what the errors say
[12:05] <markus_nagler> @Alakazamz0r: yes, as of 2 hours ago or something like that.
[12:05] <mindspin> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37323/
[12:05] <Alakazamz0r> markus... whats it do if you try and install a package.

[12:06] <mindspin> argh
[12:06] <proqesi> markus_nagler: so you're working fine then?
[12:06] <Alakazamz0r> mindspin, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:06] <Nitrolinken> frogzoo: sudo: unable to lookup lan via... bash: permission denied
[12:07] <markus_nagler> @proquesi: no. Synaptic from the command line took Yakuake with it ...
[12:07] <mindspin> Alakazamz0r: haha that leads me back to the "push the button a second" behaviour
[12:07] <Alakazamz0r> is your keyboard/mouse USB or PS2?
[12:07] <mindspin> its a notebook
[12:08] <Alakazamz0r> aaah
[12:08] <proqesi> markus_nagler: run Yakuake again and you will get another Yakuake window
[12:08] <mindspin> give me a second, to let you show what I did to xorg.conf
[12:08] <Alakazamz0r> are you sure you have everything in xorg properly configured?

[12:16] <willskills> best FAQs imho
[12:16] <willskills> hi theclaw
[12:16] <theclaw> how to set up WPA in edgy eft?
[12:16] <zeeed> network manager doesnt show any Acces points, but when I use iwlist scan i can see 2 available :/
[12:16] <willskills> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[12:17] <monzoa> ada anak jakarta atau indo
[12:17] <theclaw> is there an *easy* way? (i.e. not using wpa_supplicant by hand)
[12:17] <slacker> theclaw: wpa_suplicant
[12:17] <willskills> it tells you in there
[12:17] <theclaw> slacker: hmm i want to configure it by using the GUI
[12:17] <slacker> theclaw: then I cannot help you
[12:17] <theclaw> slacker: hm, thanks though
[12:17] <zeeed> theclaw: I have the same problem
[12:17] <theclaw> zeeed: hmm
[12:18] <zeeed> theclaw: have you tried network-manager-gnome?
[12:18] <theclaw> slacker: well i converted from debian to ubuntu because i didn't want to configure everything by hand
[12:18] <theclaw> zeeed: yes
[12:18] <theclaw> zeeed: but it doesn't help - administration -> network doesn't allow me to change the encryption type
[12:18] <slacker> theclaw: lol, ok, I can image that you want a little bit more gui in your live then :)
[12:18] <theclaw> zeeed: in ubuntu 6.06 it worked withouth problems
[12:18] <theclaw> slacker: heh ;)
[12:19] <steven> I would like to bind my new interface card with sk98link driver, any ideas?

[12:20] <sonicGB> monzoa: have you tried #psychiatry ?
[12:21] <theclaw> slacker: thanks!
[12:21] <slacker> mm, I'm gonna bookmark that one
[12:21] <theclaw> Lynoure: hrm
[12:21] <slacker> maybe it will come in handy
[12:21] <Lynoure> theclaw: But yes, the out-of-box configuration is less hassle in ubuntu
[12:22] <theclaw> Lynoure: well, a think a lot of frontends do the whole configuration thing aself rathern than changing the distribution-specific configuration files (/etc/network/interfaces in debian/ubuntu for example)
[12:22] <theclaw> Lynoure: in ubunut 6.06 it worked *flawlessly*!
[12:22] <zeeed> slacker: I will try this HOWTO ...
[12:23] <slacker> zeeed: ok
[12:23] <slacker> good luck w/ it

[12:27] <theclaw> Hobbsee: i installed network-manager-gnome, but this doesnt help
[12:27] <Lynoure> theclaw: yep, network-manager is by far the easiest way to do it. In my case, install, comment out stuff from /etc/network/interfaces and it was done. But if you need static ips that are not given to you by dhcp, I guess that takes more work
[12:28] <theclaw> Lynoure: hmm why do i have to comment out the stuff from "interfaces"?
[12:28] <slacker> Lynoure: probable you need soem pre-init (or something like that defined on your interface
=== yama` is now known as yama
[12:28] <slacker> theclaw: because the network manager will prob. set it up for you
[12:28] <Lynoure> theclaw: because it works? :)
[12:29] <theclaw> Lynoure: this answer sucks ;)
[12:29] <steven> where do I see which module my interface uses?
[12:30] <theclaw> slacker: yep - but why doesn't the "wireless connection quality" systay show up without commenting out the stuff from the interfaces file?
[12:30] <Lynoure> theclaw: I did not go digging in the code for the reason
[12:30] <Lynoure> theclaw: see http://www.lynoure.org/blog/index.php?/archives/76-Solving-the-common-NetworkManager-problem.html for what I mean
[12:31] <unfun> How come my internet stopped working in ubuntu since i installed windows?
[12:31] <slacker> theclaw: beats me .. I have tried setting up WPA and gnome-network manager w/ dapper and the one before that
[12:31] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: ok, now 'echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" >> /etc/hosts"
[12:31] <Nitrolinken> in the black and white screen?
[12:31] <slacker> theclaw: it refused my charms, so I scripted something around it
[12:31] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: the same
[12:31] <Lynoure> theclaw: it seemed to be common enough problem to merit blogging about :(  Yes. I would prefer it not to need that, but I do not maintain that package
[12:31] <theclaw> Lynoure: hrm
[12:31] <Nitrolinken> wel
[12:32] <Nitrolinken> I have a root@lan: #
[12:32] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: sure
[12:32] <theclaw> Lynoure: okay i see
[12:32] <slacker> theclaw: now I have it working like I want (somewhat bound to one location - but it works form me)
[12:32] <theclaw> Lynoure: that definitly sucks
[12:32] <frogzoo> Nitrolinken: now 'cat /etc/hosts' & you should see that line
[12:32] <theclaw> slacker: hmm i'll try to comment out the stuff in interfaces first
[12:33] <theclaw> brb, i think i have to restart gnome
[12:33] <theclaw> thanks
[12:33] <Lynoure> theclaw: well, it's not a unrecoverable change, nor require memorizing lines and lines of options. So could be worse. Trying it only takes a min or two
[12:34] <slacker> btw, are there any ubuntu package maintainers in this channel?
[12:34] <Nitrolinken> well frogzoo

[01:15] <jovans> hello i am using edgy ubuntu i have installed from the ubuntu repo nvidia-glx
[01:16] <bisexxx> hola desde sevilla
[01:16] <jovans> but on dep. now its using 2.6.19-7-386 instaed of generic is this normal
[01:17] <nolimitsoya> jovans, run 'nvidia-glx-config enable' to enable it. and change all the 386 stuff (kernels, headers, restricted) from 386 to generic
[01:17] <jovans> aha
[01:18] <jovans> shoud i uninstall the i368?
[01:18] <nolimitsoya> jovans, yes, and install the -generic packages in their place
[01:18] <jovans> aha ok thanks
[01:19] <nolimitsoya> jovans, just make sure you install all the generic packages and boot them before you remove the current runing kernel
[01:19] <jovans> sure
[01:26] <charlie> hello
[01:26] <nolimitsoya> !hi | charlie
[01:26] <ubotu> charlie: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[01:27] <charlie> hmm...complete noob here...but i didnt see this in the faq....what are my options if i just installed ubuntu, and it's running rather slow?
[01:27] <nolimitsoya> charlie, slow how?
[01:27] <charlie> it's fine when i first boot up, but after an hour or so, irc clients, firefox, everything just has slow response time
[01:27] <Paavo> charlie: how much ram do you have?
[01:28] <charlie> 768
[01:28] <mio> wine whit eyeball??????
[01:28] <jovans> hello i've got one more question what is the latency kernel?
[01:28] <charlie> do i just need more ram?
[01:28] <jovans> for wich cpu is compiled?
[01:28] <nolimitsoya> jovans, a kernel with dirrekt preempt than the regular
[01:28] <nolimitsoya> *diffrent
[01:29] <Mizipzor> which package should i use if i want to connect to a vnc server running on windows?
[01:29] <nolimitsoya> jovans, its for low latency systems, like those for music production
[01:29] <nolimitsoya> !vnc | Mizipzor
[01:29] <ubotu> Mizipzor: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[01:29] <jovans> performance benefits?
[01:29] <nolimitsoya> jovans, if you want (need) low latency its a performance boost. if you dont, its a degradation
[01:30] <echosystm> !FreeNX
[01:30] <ubotu> FreeNX is advanced remote desktop technology. For more information and install instructions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
[01:30] <echosystm> freenx is more efficient than vnc?
[01:30] <echosystm> ive not heard of it before
[01:30] <jovans> but it's the same as the generic bjut for latency right?
[01:30] <nolimitsoya> jovans, yes
[01:31] <jovans> sorry but i am not using edgy is faisty
[01:31] <nolimitsoya> jovans, where did you find it? running feisty, are you?
[01:31] <jovans> feisty
[01:31] <jovans> i mean
[01:31] <nolimitsoya> jovans, i though you would. it shouldnt be in edgy :)
[01:31] <jovans> yes it's feisty i have do today a fresh herd 1 install
[01:31] <cheleb> anybody in here using wengophone on feisty? i get a kernel oops when i try to start it
[01:31] <Mizipzor> nolimitsoya, thx
[01:31] <jovans> before was edgy installed ;)
[01:32] <nolimitsoya> jovans, cheleb feisty talk should be in #ubuntu+1
[01:32] <charlie> what's the recommended amount of RAM for running 6.10?
[01:32] <jovans> my impression is that feisty runs much more better then edgy
[01:32] <cheleb> nolimitsoya: thanks. will do so
[01:32] <ootput> hello, can any of you point me in the direction of the dir that contains the azureus binary? I can't seem to use 'which azureus' which suggests that it's not in the standard PATH. I'm trying to associate .torrents 'opened' by firefox with azureus.
[01:33] <nolimitsoya> charlie, 192 is required to run the live cd, but you can install on systems with even less ram. the requirement is realy dependant on what software you run, but for legacy systems xubuntu is the better choice

[01:34] <crystal> hello is there anyone here that knows how to install a radeon x200m?
[01:35] <nolimitsoya> vghvgh, any should be fine as long as it connects to your nic
[01:35] <MZM> crystal: is it r200 chip?
[01:35] <charlie>  well my system has a 256 and a 512 stick installed, so not quite 1gig of mem but still more then the 192 required for live cd
[01:35] <charlie> you wouldnt happen to know any Ubuntu speed optimizing guides on the web do you?  i didnt see one at the official site
[01:35] <nolimitsoya> charlie, you should be fine, and then some
[01:35] <vghvgh> sorry what is nic? the ethernet port?
[01:36] <nolimitsoya> vghvgh, Network Interface Card, so yes
[01:36] <crystal> im thinking it probably is but not really sure
[01:36] <malt1> what is a way i could backup all users home directorys like every week to make it backup the file to my directory?
[01:36] <charlie> yeah, but somehow firefox just chugs...i dual boot xp and firefox runs fine, so im thinking i did something wrong when i installed ubuntu
[01:36] <vghvgh> thank you
[01:37] <nolimitsoya> malt1, check out anacron and rsync - or hubackup
[01:37] <MZM> crystal: you can check it with lspci command.
[01:37] <MZM> crystal: I'm just asking it, as I had box with r250 chip and it was working like charm with opensource drivers (radeon)
[01:38] <crystal> it has 2 numbers rs480 and sb400
[01:39] <crystal> sb400

[01:41] <nolimitsoya> Turgon, it would, but then may i suggest you get the dvd images instead?
[01:41] <nolimitsoya> Turgon, correction: it _should_. ive not tried it :)
[01:41] <ootput> kintaro0e: line 2 mentions a config.log
[01:42] <slacker> kintaro0e: open your config.log, and look for the error
[01:42] <slacker> kintaro0e: and it also states you are missing glib
=== capunk is now known as The

[01:43] <slacker> kintaro0e: yep
[01:43] <Turgon> nolimitsoya : thanks, I'll download the DVD image then to be sure =)
[01:43] <kintaro0e> slacker: couldn't find package glib

[02:13] <bimberi> AvaEnturin: it will be on irc.gnome.org (probably #gnome but that's a guess only)
[02:13] <KillerT> nolimitsoya, i was wondering why everyone was making huge swap files
[02:13] <AvaEnturin> bimberi: thanks :)
[02:13] <bimberi> AvaEnturin: np :)
[02:13] <klaus> nolimitsoya, hmm ok, thank you
[02:13] <nn> nolimitsoya: great but that wont run on a sidekick or in an ssh session
[02:13] <KillerT> nolimitsoya, thought it was used like virtual ram in windows which didn't require as much as everyone was recommending
[02:14] <nolimitsoya> KillerT, its exactly the same as windows virtual ram
[02:14] <nn> bbiab.. too much lag
[02:14] <AvaEnturin> bimberi: got an "unknown host"
[02:14] <christiane> What is the best partiton type for a vfat fs? 0c?
[02:15] <nolimitsoya> christiane, just write an msdos partition table
=== will is now known as willskills
[02:15] <KillerT> nolimitsoya, so the safe net is to tell people to do just a little more than thier ram but it truely depends on how u use ur system
[02:15] <nolimitsoya> KillerT, quite :)
[02:15] <bimberi> AvaEnturin: hm, works here ('host irc.gnome.org' returns info)
[02:16] <klaus> .. i am trying later ...
=== finalbeta is now known as Electro
[02:17] <KillerT> one guy was in here telling people to double thier ram and this guy had two gigs so swap was like 4 and i thought it was a little overkill
[02:17] <nolimitsoya> KillerT, id second that...
[02:17] <derflooh_> nolimitsoya: do you have any idea? all modules are loaded correctly
[02:18] <christiane> nolimitsoya: I'm creating new partition table with cfdisk right now. One of the partitions will be a vfat for sharing with Windows (or is there any Windows ext/reiser rw driver you can reccomend?). What does your "just write an msdos partition table exactly mean"?
[02:18] <Reisiger> does anyone have knowledge how to get the installer of ubuntu (6.10 LiveCD) to recognise a raid 5 setup?
[02:18] <nolimitsoya> derflooh_, idea on what? i cant keep track of whos who and what problem they have in here. too many people :)
[02:18] <derflooh_> i see :) no problem
[02:19] <nolimitsoya> christiane, use ext3 and ext2ifs from fs-driver.org for windows sharing
[02:19] <KillerT> christiane, I use a fat32 partition to access with windows and linux
[02:19] <bimberi> !ext3 | christiane
[02:19] <ubotu> christiane: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[02:19] <nolimitsoya> derflooh_, give me a hint when you are reviving old requests and imight be more helpfull :)
[02:20] <christiane> bimberi, nolimitsoya: Cool. Thanks.
[02:20] <sonicGB_> uh, I think ubotu might be wrong there... ext2 works (very well) but ext3 is unrecognised
[02:20] <sonicGB_> at least that's been my experience
[02:20] <nolimitsoya> sonicGB_, not quite. ext2 and 3 are fullty compatible. the only thing is you wont get journaling when accessing from windows with ex2ifs
[02:20] <KillerT> ext 2 is ext 3 just with journaling
[02:21] <KillerT> backwards
[02:21] <KillerT> ext 3 is ext 2 just with journaling
[02:21] <sonicGB_> nolimitsoya: understand that, but a while about (about 6 months ago, it may have changed since then) I built the linux half of a box with ext3 everywhere, then loaded up those drivers in winders and it didn't find any of them
[02:22] <KillerT> Arn't these all beta drivers though. I mean linux can even access read and write to ntfs but it can create errors wouldn't it be best to use something more stable?
[02:22] <AvaEnturin> hallo? can someone please help me to find a gnome-channel? irc.gnome.org doesnt work for me...
[02:22] <sonicGB_> when I went back and read the fine print, the drivers (at that point in time) couldn't deal with the ext3 tweaks
[02:22] <nolimitsoya> sonicGB_, thats odd. working excelent now either way
[02:22] <sonicGB_> now I also point out that my information is about 6 months old, so the code may well have been updated
[02:22] <ibookUbuntu> is there a powerpc help channel?
[02:22] <christiane> AvaEnturin: Try irc.freenode.org
[02:23] <nolimitsoya> AvaEnturin, irc.gnome.org is the server you need to connect to, on port 6667 id think. #gnome is the channel to join when you get there
[02:23] <AvaEnturin> yes, i know: as i mentioned before, i get "unknown host" when i try to connect to it (added it with irc.gnome.org on the server list)
[02:23] <MarcusTheReveren> anyone know a gui that will display all the wireless networks around and their signal strength?
[02:23] <Electro> Damned, windows is so much more fun to play with software, new program version comes out that fixes something. You use it. he you have to wait 6 months to get it. if you are lucky. They really need to figure something out for this.
[02:23] <sonicGB_> but I also wonder why ubotu says "ext3" and the fs-driver.org says "ext2" in the header and description...
[02:24] <The> ssuuucccckkkkkk u alll
[02:24] <nolimitsoya> Electro, you are using the wrong distro. get gentoo
[02:24] <Thuryn> Hello
[02:24] <str4> hey
[02:24] <nolimitsoya> sonicGB_, as i said, the driver is ext2 only, but ext3 and ext2 are compatible
[02:24] <Electro> nolimitsoya, I did, gentoo is the wrong distro 2. I want my desktop working for me. Not me for my desktop.
[02:24] <jru_> irc://irc.freenode.org/gnome
[02:25] <sonicGB_> nolimitsoya: I'm not disagreeing with you dude, just recounting my own experience....
[02:25] <gnomefreak> ext3 == ext2 + journaling

[02:25] <ibookUbuntu> does anyone know how to turn off the fading of the screen when putting the computer to sleep or going to suspend
[02:25] <ibookUbuntu> it runs super slow on my computer
[02:25] <ibookUbuntu> or how to speed it up
[02:25] <nolimitsoya> ibookUbuntu, look under screensaver properties
[02:26] <sonicGB_> my own direct experience, about 6 months ago, was that the winders ext2 driver didn't recognise ext3 filesystems for me. Wierd, I know, but when I changed them to ext2, it was all good! :-)
[02:26] <Alakazamz0r> ibookUbuntu, you need to enable DRI
[02:26] <ibookUbuntu> just in xorg.conf?
[02:27] <KillerT> I think Electro would rather stick with windows for simple and quick installs of the latest and greatest without any hassle even if he has to deal with all the bugs viruses worms trojans and overall insecure windows
[02:27] <sonicGB_> oh, I love it when folks come in here asking for help and they already know what config files are! :-) <warm glow> :-)
[02:27] <KillerT> or try mac?
[02:28] <arte_> hi
[02:28] <ibookUbuntu> Alakazamz0r: it's loaded as a module in xorg.conf... how do I enable it?
[02:28] <arte_> why cant i view all users in list ?
[02:28] <Thuryn> ok
[02:28] <arte_> on xchat i mean
[02:28] <Alakazamz0r> ibookUbuntu, do you know if its already enabled
[02:28] <Alakazamz0r> do this
[02:28] <Alakazamz0r> glxinfo |grep render
[02:28] <nolimitsoya> arte_, couse they are 882 as of now, and your client probably dont want to handle that :P
[02:29] <sonicGB_> KillerT: I'm on a max as we speak and... er... *cough*... I'm not so sure I like mac!
[02:29] <Alakazamz0r> or actually
[02:29] <Alakazamz0r> glxinfo |grep direct

[02:30] <Alakazamz0r> ibookUbuntu, im not sure whats doing it then.
[02:30] <MUTU> In general, would a game run fastest on Windows or on Ubuntu + Cedega/WINE?
[02:30] <rapid> arte_: you can view all users on list. what do you mean in each channel;?
[02:30] <Alakazamz0r> it should fade without being choppy
[02:30] <arte_> ok suggest som alternative ..
[02:30] <rapid> MUTU: probably windows..
[02:30] <sonicGB_> MUTU: in broad terms, it would be more quickerer on winders directly
[02:30] <nolimitsoya> ibookUbuntu, using vesa/floss driver or proprietary?
[02:30] <sonicGB_> actually, not necessarily
[02:30] <ibookUbuntu> it's not choppy at all, it just takes years to fade
[02:30] <MUTU> thanks rapid and sonicGB_
[02:30] <Electro> KillerT, I've never actually had a virus and spyware scans always turn out nothing. And my Ubuntu box tends to crash more then my windows box. I guess I'm only here as a hobbyist. Windows is still my general purpose/development dream while nix can run my servers... Yet, if ubuntu wants to be for the masses. They will have to solve those issues.
[02:30] <KillerT> sonicGB: I would never suggest it to someone to install ubuntu on. I mean u can build a much more powerful system for half the price but osx is entertaining and there is less "work" involved and a more stable workplace
[02:30] <ibookUbuntu> like a total of 5 minutes
[02:31] <sonicGB_> it might actually be more quickerer on wine..... remember "wine is not an emulator"
[02:31] <diskus> Electro: what issues?
[02:31] <arte_> is there any better irc client for ubuntu ?
[02:31] <Electro> I will give MAc a try though.
[02:31] <diskus> Electro: my Ubuntu never crashes
[02:31] <arte_> wine sucks
[02:31] <QwertyM> Hmm, does Ubuntu run perfectly on a macbook ?
[02:31] <rapid> arte_: you were given a post, + xchat is fine
[02:31] <KillerT> Electro: My ubuntu never crashes unless I tell it to
[02:31] <QwertyM> and severe limitations ?
[02:31] <defaultuser> not perfectly
[02:31] <arte_> win progs works the same as in win
[02:31] <nolimitsoya> Electro, i realy hope youve filed a bugreport
[02:31] <sonicGB_> KillerT: the first thing I did when I got this macbook (a week ago) was set it up to triple-boot osx, kubuntu and winders
[02:32] <arte_> sometimes it hangs muy ubuntu
[02:32] <nolimitsoya> Electro, or bugreports, if thats more apropriate
[02:32] <QwertyM> defaultuser, ohk, then I wont get a mac as my next comp ...
[02:32] <KillerT> Electro: It is also common knowledge in the 3 minutes u plug a fresh install up to the internet u get hit with a malware
[02:32] <sonicGB_> QwertyM: *kubuntu* installed painlessly on this macbook... I haven't actually used it very much yet
[02:32] <QwertyM> thought it would be good to run Ubuntu, Win and OSx perfectly
[02:32] <Electro> diskus, I'm on a dell inspiron. Should be properly supported. I files reports, but it's hard to trace why my metacity freezes up every two hours untill I switch to cntr-alt-somethingelse and back. Or why it freezes sometimes when I plug in an USB disk.
[02:32] <QwertyM> and together
[02:32] <duzchip> Hi guys. I need some help here please. I've got an old iMac (233 mhz iirc). I installed Ubuntu (i know this is rather hated) for fun to try it out on mac a while ago but now i really wanna get NetBSD back onto it. However, it refuses to boot the netbsd install cd now i press down C during the bootup as i'm supposed to do but only gets to the Ubuntu bootstrap where i can chose to boot either the installed system or the cdrom so i chosed to
[02:33] <daimoh> don't suppose anyone knows why DVD playback under myth on tvout is all blue, but works fine on the LCD monitor?
[02:33] <QwertyM> sonicGB_, ohk, good luck with it :D
[02:33] <nolimitsoya> KillerT, 3min it a bit long... symantec estimated 20sec the last time they did any serious investigations
[02:33] <defaultuser> hey QwertyM, i like macs
=== danim is now known as daniminas
[02:33] <daimoh> (having only just installed myth)
[02:33] <Electro> KillerT, that's true. But i've done pentesting etc. I know how to stay safe.
[02:33] <Alakazamz0r> duzchip, nuke the drive.
[02:33] <defaultuser> but why to install ubuntu on it?
[02:33] <Alakazamz0r> write it to 0's
[02:33] <daimoh> er... mythtv
[02:33] <Alakazamz0r> or... just repartition it.
[02:33] <QwertyM> defaultuser, I love it too, but I cant afford using 2 different comps lol
[02:33] <duzchip> Alakazamz0r: how?
[02:33] <Alakazamz0r> what kind of drive is it.
[02:33] <sonicGB_> QwertyM: like I said, the first thing when I got this macbook (core 2 duo, 2gb, 120gb) a week ago was make it triple-boot winders, osx, kubuntu.... I had to jump through a few hoops, but there was never any indication that it was gonna argue with me... it all just worked
[02:33] <QwertyM> defaultuser, I love Ubuntu, thats why
[02:34] <Alakazamz0r> Whatever brand it is, the company that makes it has a utilities disk for it.
[02:34] <defaultuser> why not to use just mac? :)
[02:34] <duzchip> Alakazamz0r, Have no idea. it's one of those old iMac's which i've never ever been inside of
[02:34] <Alakazamz0r> defaultuser, no cursing.
[02:34] <rapid> defaultuser, macintosh = most applications crash if not the operating system hangs
[02:34] <sonicGB_> defaultuser: you asking me?
[02:34] <Alakazamz0r> duzchip, try this
[02:34] <MattDaPcWiz> alright anyone willing to help a guy in need?
[02:34] <QwertyM> sonicGB_, Oh ok, I'll google a little more and decide then
[02:34] <Alakazamz0r> i cant gaurentee anything
[02:34] <seanh> Hey folks, I'm trying to get a friends Ubuntu laptop to access another friend's WindowsXP shared folder by following this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountWindowsSharesPermanently Anyone know how I find out the name of the server and the share in Windows?
[02:35] <Alakazamz0r> duzchip, http://ebcd.pcministry.com/download_en.html
[02:35] <rapid> seanh, go into into network settings, look for shared drivers.
[02:35] <fyrestrtr> seanh: you can browse network places in ubuntu.
[02:35] <Electro> diskus, the crashes are the least of my problems, they seem hardware related, so i'll blame that on myself for buying the hardware. The general limitations of repositories, and multimedia are more of an issue.
[02:35] <rapid> drives even
[02:35] <Alakazamz0r> brb
[02:35] <QwertyM> defaultuser, Coz I need Ubuntu or any *nix equal to it (lol) for my developments :)

[02:35] <MattDaPcWiz> alright, currently guys im trying to get a Marvell Yukon network adaptor to work, it is built into mymotherboard, and when i try to install it it says syntax error 68 and comaplins about a ")" symbole wtf do i do?
[02:35] <KillerT> Electro: With metacity freezing r u sure that isn't because u setup swap incorrectly?
[02:35] <diskus> Electro: well I don't see any problems with multimedia on my laptop
[02:35] <sonicGB_> seanh: "ipconfig /all" and "rbtstat" are your friends on winders.... if you need more info say so and I'll fire up my winders box and tell you command lines
[02:36] <fyrestrtr> MattDaPcWiz: was it working in the livecd?
[02:36] <sonicGB_> seanh: also "net share" is useful
[02:36] <MattDaPcWiz> no this is installed
[02:36] <defaultuser> QwertyM, well, which kind of developing
[02:36] <seanh> fyrestrtr -- oh yeah. Since when? Does installing samba or smbfs enable that automatically?
[02:36] <Electro> KillerT, I've got 512MB ram, 512Mb swap, at the moment it freezes i'm not using more then 300MB ram.
[02:36] <MUTU> My hard disk is formatted in ext2. Would the Ubuntu DVD installation allow me to format it as ext3?

[02:37] <Electro> diskus, I'm a human ;)
[02:37] <KillerT> daimoh does it say something about mesa.org?
[02:37] <daimoh> yeah, mesa.org
[02:37] <Electro> using that as a marketing line tends to say much.
[02:37] <MattDaPcWiz>  alright, currently guys im trying to get a Marvell Yukon network adaptor to work, it is built into mymotherboard, and when i try to install it it says syntax error 68 and comaplins about a ")" symbole wtf do i do?

[02:39] <KillerT> christiane is that card even supported yet with the ati linux drivers
[02:39] <MattDaPcWiz> i got the driver off intel and it instructs me to use a install.sh that came in the packed file
[02:39] <daimoh> at http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide#Troubleshooting_for_both_Methods i see it says you just disable composite mode

[02:48] <IndyGUnFreak> how do you ignore a user?
[02:48] <MattDaPcWiz> ok rapid, this is the ONLY driver for it, i am trying to install it and the only problem is that it is saying a syntax erroir 68 to do with a certain ")" symbol
[02:48] <rapid> IndyGUnFreak, /ignore
[02:48] <sonicGB_> seanh: fark! that's what I love about computers... they're always coming up with new erra messages that you've never seen before... *cough*
[02:48] <seanh> It says it won't open the share in case it's a security risk
[02:48] <sonicGB_> IndyGUnFreak: use /ignore <username>
[02:48] <IndyGUnFreak> i think it worked, thanks
[02:49] <rapid> MattDaPcWiz, is it a linux driver, did you read the docs for the driver.
[02:49] <sonicGB_> u welcome
[02:49] <rapid> arte_, could be, I'm in australia :)
[02:49] <apokryphos> root_: you shouldn't IRC as root

[02:49] <ox> ahh xgl yes thanks
[02:50] <MattDaPcWiz> rapid, yes it is a linux driver, i specifically searched for linux driver and found one on the intel site and a few others but they are all THE SAME DRIVER
[02:50] <sonicGB_> rapid: fwiw, we discussed MattDaPcWiz 's problem earlier today. The Marvel Yukon is a gigabit ethernet adaptor that (unfortunately) has a bit of a history in ubuntu.... there are two different drivers for it, one called sky2, and onother called <something>98<something>...
[02:50] <sonicGB_> the sky2 is borken for many people
[02:50] <arte_> whois rapid
[02:50] <arte_> :)
[02:50] <MattDaPcWiz> sky2 is the one that i have
[02:50] <sonicGB_> so what he needs to do is find the older driver in module form... unload the sky2 and load the other
[02:50] <MattDaPcWiz> i jus tam having trouble installing it
[02:50] <monzoa> my souncard dosnot work
[02:50] <arte_> rapid is australian lol
[02:50] <sonicGB_> but he dissapeared offline this morning before I got to spell that out
[02:50] <daimoh> rapid: any handy urls for figuring out why my flgrx stuff ain't working? (getting that mesa3d stuff with flgrxinfo)
[02:50] <MattDaPcWiz> nononononono i just need to installsky2 but it wont let me :'(

[02:51] <rapid> diamoh: one second.
[02:51] <IndyGUnFreak> Mutu, it only takes about 30sec on my machine
[02:51] <IndyGUnFreak> but i guess it would all depend on the PC
[02:51] <sonicGB_> MattDaPcWiz: according to the gargling i did this morning, the sky2 driver is included in the distro you have, but sky2 is borken for lots of folks
[02:51] <arte_> rapid where is this server location ?
[02:52] <MUTU> IndyGUnFreak: it's taken 5 mins from mine and it's giving Buffer I/O error on device hdc
[02:52] <MattDaPcWiz> right, so how do i load this fixed one?
[02:52] <MattDaPcWiz> i have it
[02:52] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm
[02:52] <MattDaPcWiz> where do i put it?
[02:52] <rapid> arte_: I honestly don't know.. run a traceroute or a nmap
[02:52] <sonicGB_> !fuckyouyougotohellandyoudie | apokryphos
[02:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fuckyouyougotohellandyoudie - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:52] <IndyGUnFreak> MUTU, I would probably try to download the Alternate Install CD
[02:52] <MUTU> hdc would be the DVD-ROM drive?
[02:52] <up365> monzoa: go to http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449
[02:52] <kkaisare> Greetings all.
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> should be.
[02:53] <MUTU> I could reburn the ISO...
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> Mutu, thats what I would do.
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> but burn the Alternate Install CD
[02:53] <MUTU> cos i burned it on a dvd which was a bit scatched already :)
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> well that might be your problem
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> reburning would be a good idea.
[02:53] <MUTU> but it verified on my DVDRW
[02:53] <seanh> Anyone know what to do about this error, when trying to access a smb-share on a Windows machine? http://seanh.freeshell.org/screenshot.png
[02:53] <desert88> hi
[02:53] <MUTU> lemme try another dvd :)
[02:54] <MattDaPcWiz> sonicGB_ can i chat to u privately?
[02:54] <desert88> im new to linux
[02:54] <desert88> can anyone help me install amarok
[02:54] <rapid> diamoh: just make sure you read the docs when install fglrx .
[02:54] <flasher222> i installed a program via "sudo aptitude install foo". If I go "sudo aptitude remove foo", will it remove _everything_ that the install installed?
[02:54] <rapid> desert88: try a apt-get install amarok
[02:54] <apokryphos> desert88: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[02:54] <MattDaPcWiz> Desert88, welcome to the club
[02:54] <jrib> flasher222: use purge, not remove
[02:54] <malt1> is there any way to have the linux server backup all the users home folder?
[02:54] <desert88> k thnx
[02:54] <johns^> malt1: tons of ways
[02:54] <flasher222> jrib: oops. too late. how can i undo my remove?
[02:55] <rapid> malt1, of course, use tar
[02:55] <johns^> or rsync
[02:55] <jrib> flasher222: install :P
[02:55] <flasher222> jrib: you're serious?
[02:55] <malt1> like to get it to backup there folders 1 time a week to a certain directory
[02:55] <jrib> flasher222: yes, I don't know of another way
[02:55] <johns^> yeah reboot time. Removed fc-6 and edgy is back :)
[02:55] <MattDaPcWiz> Sonicgb_ can i have a private conversation with u?
[02:55] <frogzoo> seanh: did you mount the smb share ?
[02:55] <rapid> malt1: make a cron entry to tar /home weekly
[02:55] <daimoh> rapid: there's docs? :)
[02:56] <Zodiac`> i tried to do some stuff with partion magic and with ubuntu install, it didnt go, and when i tried to run "Norton Partion Magic" again, i got this error: "Drive letters cannot be identified" :/ Someone help? (nolimitsoya)
[02:56] <rapid> diamoh: of course there is...
[02:56] <flasher222> jrib: ok.
[02:56] <apokryphos> MattDaPcWiz: that person is not in the channel.
[02:56] <johns^> rsync is a better option :)
[02:56] <seanh> frogzoo -- I have to mount it first? Do you know how I do it?
[02:56] <johns^> incremental backups to another dir, backups of removed files
[02:56] <frogzoo> seanh: easiest way I think is to use smb4k
[02:56] <flasher222> if i install something via "sudo apt-get install foo", can i still run "sudo aptitude remove" OR "sudo aptitude purge"?
[02:56] <MattDaPcWiz> crap he musta left
[02:56] <daimoh> rapid: i just followed http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide
[02:56] <daimoh> the top bit
[02:56] <apokryphos> flasher222: yes, but it won't remove the extra depends it brought in
[02:57] <flasher222> another question; how can i filter my command line history by the phrase "word1 word2"?
[02:57] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, i tried to do some stuff with partion magic and with ubuntu install, it didnt go, and when i tried to run "Norton Partion Magic" again, i got this error: "Drive letters cannot be identified" :/
[02:57] <daimoh> the quick & "easy" bit
[02:57] <MattDaPcWiz> alright can i have a private convo with ANYONE about trouble with a Marvell Yukon Adaptor
[02:57] <apokryphos> flasher222: cat ~/.bash_history|grep word1 word2
[02:57] <flasher222> oh, apokryphos, so why would anyone want to use apt-get then, when aptitude is so much better?
[02:57] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: fan club?
[02:57] <rapid> daimoh: I'm not sure with ubuntu.. but if it returns a MESA string somethings not right. as stated in the fglrx documentation from memory.
[02:57] <apokryphos> !msg| MattDaPcWiz
[02:57] <ubotu> MattDaPcWiz: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[02:57] <daimoh> mattdapc: that sonic dude got kicked - just msg him direct
[02:57] <apokryphos> gnomefreak: must be 8)
[02:57] <gnomefreak> flasher222: aptitude isnt better in all situations
[02:58] <apokryphos> flasher222: because it's not always better. It depends on what you want to do.
[02:58] <MattDaPcWiz> alright fine im going to ask this one more time
[02:58] <flasher222> are there some situations/packages when a aptitude purge is the same as an aptitude remove?
[02:58] <daimoh> rapid: yeah, i think that means the dri thing is broken. I read something that says one thing to try, but that thing to try don't work. I'll dig around a bit more - thanks
[02:58] <flasher222> apokryphos: when is aptitude worse than apt-egt
[02:58] <apokryphos> flasher222: purge removes config files, remove doesn't
[02:58] <flasher222> and all packages have config files?
[02:58] <rapid> daimoh: i would google for fglrx and read the docs.
[02:59] <KillerT> flasher: I use aptitude before aptget
[02:59] <apokryphos> flasher222: aptitude automatically installs recommends. Sometimes you don't always want that. Furthermore, sometimes you dont' always want to remove extra depends lying around.
[02:59] <gnomefreak> flasher222: one when you dont know what your doing. 2 when some of the depends are from 3rd party repos
[02:59] <daimoh> rapid: will do - cheers
[02:59] <flasher222> For example, lame, timidity, noteedit
[02:59] <buddhalover> hello world

[02:59] <rapid> printf("Hi\n)":
[02:59] <MattDaPcWiz> alright i have a Marvell Yukon adaptor built into my motherboard, i GOT A LINUX DRIVER sky2 for it and it is supposed to work and i have folloed the instructions, but when it telle me to run the install.sh i do so and it says syntax error 68 and compains about a vertain ")" symbol, and i cannot find any abnormal ones is there a way i can manually place the files or SOMETHING?
[02:59] <MattDaPcWiz> i would prefer not to backtrack
[03:00] <nolimitsoya> MattDaPcWiz, please, youve already been instructed on the issue. follow that advice
[03:00] <flasher222> Do \all packages have config files?
[03:00] <gnomefreak> KillerT: no you dont apt-get wont remove needed packages (if you dont know about what packages are needed than aptitude can mess you up
[03:00] <Bernardo> hi
[03:00] <MattDaPcWiz> no i have not
[03:00] <nolimitsoya> flasher222, no, but many
[03:00] <Zodiac`> i tried to do some stuff with partion magic and with ubuntu install, it didnt go, and when i tried to run "Norton Partion Magic" again, i got this error: "Drive letters cannot be identified" :/

[03:00] <flasher222> nolimitsoya: i see
[03:00] <semboy> hello guys , does anyone knowz about autoinstaller

[03:01] <apokryphos> !caps
[03:01] <ubotu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.

[03:01] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[03:01] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, how to fix then? :/
[03:01] <Bernardo> any mythtv/mysql wiz here?
[03:01] <gnomefreak> KillerT: it trys to fix existing and alot of times you will see it does more harm than good
[03:01] <flasher222> i am on xubuntu/xfce. i have installed a program that uses kde libraries.
[03:01] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, it might not even be possible. as i said, its dangerous. hope you have a backup :)
[03:01] <Zodiac`> havn't XD
[03:01] <KillerT> gnome-freak: Yeah...if the settings are correct. And it will fix broken packages too
[03:02] <mrabbit> hey, my torrents on ubuntu 6.10 rarely reach 30kb/s, but on suse they used to average at 50kb/s, does anybody have a solution please?
=== kakado_ is now known as kakado
[03:02] <flasher222> If that kde program is not currently being used, will the kde libraries be  working in the background, slowing my computer down?
[03:02] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, then you better take some deep breaths :P
[03:02] <apokryphos> !tab | KillerT
[03:02] <ubotu> KillerT: You can use <tab> for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[03:02] <apokryphos> flasher222: no
[03:02] <nolimitsoya> flasher222, they might, but usualy shouldnt
[03:02] <seanh> frogzoo - smb4k is saying smbmnt fails, it says "smbmnt must be installed suid root for direct user mounts"
[03:02] <gnomefreak> KillerT: no it works around them most of time depending on how broken it is. apt-get -f install fixes broken packages

[03:03] <diskus> well it's a lot easier than debian
[03:03] <CharminTheMoose> Zodiac it is easy to  instaall
[03:03] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, if someone tells you something is realy dangerous you should exercise caution and ask one time to many rather than one time to little :)
[03:03] <apokryphos> !relationship is <reply> Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship
[03:03] <flasher222> apokryphos:  "cat ~/.bash_history|grep word1 word2" does not work, because it thinks that word2 is a file or directory
[03:03] <mrabbit> please help, it took a day to download 247mb
[03:03] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, still it sucks
=== timothyp is now known as TimothyP
[03:03] <apokryphos> flasher222: use quotes then
[03:04] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, ubuntu is _very_ easy to install. its just that resizeing is dangerous if you dont know what you are doing or if youre having bad luck
[03:04] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: i thought ther ewas one for that under a different name
[03:04] <flasher222> apokryphos: ahh! just like google

[03:04] <CharminTheMoose> zodiac` ubuntu is very easy to install as long as you know wtf you're talking about
[03:04] <KillerT> apokryphos: thnx...some reason I didn't think to try tab\ with gaim
[03:04] <Nippoo> heheh.
[03:04] <Nippoo> !shut up!
[03:04] <diskus> Zodiac`: you suck probably if you think that installing ubuntu is not easy :P
[03:04] <ubotu> :x
[03:04] <Nippoo> =)
[03:04] <gnomefreak> fenrig: its in main i believe
[03:04] <Nippoo> sorry. couldn't help it.
[03:04] <TimothyP> Hello, I have a computer with 7 hard drives, Ubuntu sees all of them but when I try to configure raid 0 I can only select up to 3 devices and ubuntu does nothing with it, I tried using LVM but it says the kernel does not support it, why is it in there then and how do I use it, I need to get one really big partition
[03:04] <gnomefreak> !info gparted
[03:04] <ubotu> gparted: GNOME partition editor. In component main, is optional. Version 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu11 (edgy), package size 314 kB, installed size 1588 kB
[03:05] <fenrig> strange
[03:05] <Zodiac`> diskus, it did so that i cant run partition magic anymore..
[03:05] <MattDaPcWiz> nolimitsoya can u please tell me what advice i have been given that has worked? i just started using linux today man gimme a break and help me
[03:05] <gnomefreak> fenrig: sudo apt-get install gparted
[03:05] <diskus> Zodiac`: it was probably you who did that
[03:05] <apokryphos> gnomefreak: yeah, just added an alias now; added more info.
[03:05] <seanh> Is there any command to mount a Windows share once, without editing config files to mount it permanemtly?
[03:05] <Zodiac`> diskus, still, i did it while installing ubuntu XD
[03:05] <KillerT> apokryphos: my other clients i type piece of the name with : and it would fill in automatically
[03:05] <nolimitsoya> MattDaPcWiz, i cant. you have been adviced to use the <something>98<something> driver instead of the one you are curently attempting, and thats all i know
[03:06] <diskus> Zodiac`: so it was you, not ubuntu..
[03:06] <Zodiac`> btw, where to download PARTINFO?
[03:06] <Zodiac`> symantec tells me to.
[03:06] <MattDaPcWiz> right well thanks anyway
[03:06] <apokryphos> KillerT: tab is a much better method :P
[03:06] <TimothyP> nolimitsoya: I've known ubuntu to go wrong or mess up quite a few times, no matter how much people would love to say it's perfect, nothing is perfect :)
[03:06] <MattDaPcWiz> seeya
[03:06] <rapid> ask symantec
[03:06] <KillerT> apokryphos: true
[03:06] <mrabbit> please somebody help me, these slow torrent speeds are evil :p
[03:06] <CharminTheMoose> if i've already installed dellinc.inf and modprobed ndiswrapper and then reboot the computer,does modprobe modprobe it again at boot?
[03:06] <flasher222> i did "sudo aptitude purge someKDEprogram", but the only things removed were the KDEprogram and a few others. The KDE libraries seem to NOT have been removed/purged. pls advise
[03:06] <flasher222> (i'm on xubuntu{)
[03:06] <rapid> CharminTheMoose, no
[03:07] <nolimitsoya> TimothyP, ive never said otherwize :)
[03:07] <rapid> CharminTheMoose, you will have to do it yourself. or add a script somewhere
[03:07] <apokryphos> flasher222: sudo apt-get remove kdelibs*
[03:07] <apokryphos> flasher222: if you really want to remove those extra libs
[03:07] <CharminTheMoose> rapid:cool,thanks
[03:07] <TimothyP> I know I'm verifing what you were thinking :)
[03:07] <TimothyP> because I noticed someone say you're stupid if you don't think it's easy to install, I think it's stupid for someone to make such a remark
[03:07] <TimothyP> so don't listen to them :)
[03:07] <flasher222> apokryphos: ok. thanks. but how come sodo aptitude purge -omeKDEprogram, did not remove those libs, the libs that were installed when i did "sudo aptitude install someKDEprogram?
[03:08] <tapas> yo, i have a non computersavy friend who has installed windows on his other partition and now grub stage 1 is of course gone..
[03:08] <apokryphos> flasher222: could've been for many reasons
[03:08] <fenrig> cant find gparted
[03:08] <fenrig> really not
[03:08] <nolimitsoya> TimothyP, i think youre talking o the wrong person. im not the one with a messed up partition table :)
[03:08] <CharminTheMoose> tapas,then reinstall it!
[03:08] <TimothyP> ah :)
[03:08] <tapas> gesides going through the typical a]  boot ffrom live cd b]  mount root partition c]  chroot into it d]  run grub-install
[03:08] <apokryphos> fenrig: alt+f2 -> gparted
[03:08] <monzoa> any indonesian
[03:08] <tapas> [which is too hard for him] 
[03:08] <gnomefreak> fenrig: make your sources/list use the net repos instead of the cd rom repos
[03:08] <TimothyP> fenrig:  try adding universe / mutiverse repos
[03:08] <tapas> is there a fool proof way to do this from the live cd?
[03:08] <TimothyP> anybody on the LVM question ?
[03:09] <fenrig> no
[03:09] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: its not installed by default is it"
[03:09] <gnomefreak> ?
[03:09] <CharminTheMoose> tapas,Couldn't you do it?if you live close to your friend.
[03:09] <gnomefreak> TimothyP: its in main
[03:09] <theBishop> has anyone booted Ubuntu PPC on a Playstation3 yet?
[03:09] <flasher222> apokryphos: Couldn't find package "kdelibs*".  However, the following packages contain "kdelibs*" in their name:  kdelibs4c2a kdelibs4-dev kdelibs4-doc kdelibs-data kdelibs5 kdelibs5-dev kdelibs-bin kdelibs-dbg kdelibs-dev   kdelibs-doc kdelibs
[03:09] <Fozzie> Are there any Beryl experts around?
[03:09] <tapas> CharminTheMoose: yah..i could go there and do it. but i wonder if ubuntu has a nice foolproof way for this, so i don't have to
[03:09] <nolimitsoya> !lvm | TimothyP
[03:09] <ubotu> TimothyP: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[03:09] <apokryphos> erm, I'm pretty sure the wildcard should take care of that
[03:09] <flasher222> apokryphos: how do i remove all these?
[03:09] <tapas> i have better thigns to do
[03:09] <gnomefreak> flasher222: look at the last one
[03:09] <TimothyP> thnx :)
[03:09] <rapid> tapas: go do your better things than
[03:09] <apokryphos> flasher222: just do sudo apt-get remove kdelibs4c2a
[03:10] <TimothyP> Fozzie:  depends on what you need to know :p
[03:10] <tapas> rapid: thanks for the awesome help..
[03:10] <gnomefreak> trying to remove kde all together?
[03:10] <rapid> tapas: no worries
[03:10] <gnomefreak> hint libqt3-mt
[03:10] <tapas> so the answer to my question is: "no"?
[03:10] <Fozzie> Timothyp I just installed Beryl, and now my cpu's at 100%
[03:10] <mrabbit> please help me, i cant find any solution for my slow torrents, they average at 50kb/s on suse, but rarely reach 30kb/s on ubuntu
[03:10] <semboy_> ello guys , my nat got split , i am askin agein , is there a program that can let me installd nvidia driver for my computer ?? i mean autoinstall
[03:10] <nolimitsoya> Fozzie, beryl is experimental, broken and buggy
[03:10] <Zodiac`> " Error #120: Logical Drive chain extends toward start of drive."
[03:10] <rapid> mrabbit, go suse :)
[03:10] <apokryphos> gnomefreak: hm, you're right.
[03:10] <TimothyP> Fozzie: what graphics card are you using?
[03:10] <gnomefreak> Fozzie: join #ubuntu-xgl for help with it
[03:10] <mrabbit> rapid:i left suse cos it kept playing up
[03:11] <rapid> mrabbit, i can't help you i use slackware
[03:11] <semboy_> !nvidiainstaller
[03:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidiainstaller - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:11] <flasher222> apokryphos: if i do "sudo apt-get remove kdelibs4c2a" will it remove all kde stuff?
[03:11] <mrabbit> rapid:i had to keep reinstalling it :p, i prefer ubuntu for everything else
[03:11] <Fozzie> i've got a poor ATI Radeon 200m
[03:11] <nolimitsoya> !nvidia > semboy
[03:11] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: libqt3-mt is the main qt library
[03:11] <apokryphos> flasher222: try, and see.
[03:11] <gnomefreak> flasher222: remove libqy3-mt
[03:11] <gnomefreak> oops
[03:11] <nolimitsoya> !nvidia > semboy_
[03:11] <gnomefreak> libqt3-mt
[03:11] <semboy_> nolimitsoya i want to autoinstall :S
[03:11] <apokryphos> flasher222: if you want to remove all qt-related libs then remove what gnomefreak says too
[03:11] <TimothyP> I had simular problems at first, didn't have enough video memory
[03:12] <nolimitsoya> semboy_, look at the message from ubotu
[03:12] <fenrig> it doesnt work
[03:12] <diskus> Fozzie: I would suggest that forget XGL with express 200M for atleast 6 months
[03:12] <fenrig> well il boot the live cd
[03:12] <semboy_> nolimitsoya i got it
[03:12] <fenrig> oh can sombody help me out
[03:12] <fenrig> with my nvidia driver
[03:12] <apokryphos> !helpme
[03:12] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:12] <gnomefreak> fenrig: paste your /etc/apt/sources.list file to pastebin please
[03:12] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, Error #120: Logical Drive chain extends toward start of drive.
[03:12] <gnomefreak> fenrig: now nvidia?
[03:12] <apokryphos> fenrig: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[03:12] <Fozzie> ok, whats the best way to uninstall it all?
[03:12] <osah> Hello can someone help me :)
[03:12] <semboy_> nolimitsoya but it does not allow me to autoinstall
[03:12] <gnomefreak> fenrig: what happened with gparted
[03:12] <mrabbit> please can somebody help me, it's like the ports arnt correctly opened, my router is set up fine, and i dont think im running a firewall on ubuntu
[03:12] <rapid> osah: JUST ASK
[03:12] <TimothyP> Fozzie: dunno about the ATI drivers, but the NVIDIA drivers have that problem because they can't use shared memory for a certain extension
[03:12] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, youve probaly hozed your partitiontable. all data on that drive would most likely be lost
[03:12] <fenrig> no but
[03:12] <flasher222> apokryphos: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37363/. should i do "autoremove"
[03:12] <fenrig> everything is installed
[03:13] <fenrig> but it doesnt works
[03:13] <semboy_> nolimitsoya i have heard that , there is an autoinstaller for nvidia , but i guyess i got it wrong
[03:13] <fenrig> strange i think
[03:13] <osah> I have a fat32 partition I:, how can i access it from ubuntu.. so i can place my windows files on it and then on linux access it... i thought linux can read fat32...
[03:13] <TimothyP> semboy_ no there is one
[03:13] <gnomefreak> fenrig: paste your /etc/apt/sources.lis file to pastebin
[03:13] <apokryphos> flasher222: looks ok
[03:13] <tapas> oh well i figure then it is..
[03:13] <rapid> osah: it can aslong as your kernel says so
[03:13] <semboy_> fimothyp okei
[03:13] <TimothyP> semboy_ can't think of the name tough but it's noted on beryl project site
[03:13] <seanh> Anyone know what the username and password are supposed to be, when mounting a Windows share from Ubuntu? Is it the username and password of one of the Windows users?
[03:13] <osah> rapid: do you know how i can configure it? to do so?
[03:13] <CharminTheMoose> seanh:WHy not?
[03:13] <semboy_> timothyp k
[03:13] <gnomefreak> flasher222: you will still have kde things installed
[03:14] <flasher222> will i still be able to use opera browser if i remove qt and kde libraries?
[03:14] <osah> it deosnt have to read NTFS, but fat32 woul;d be helpful
[03:14] <mrabbit> osah:sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda[num]  /media/fat
[03:14] <mrabbit> i think
[03:14] <gnomefreak> flasher222: i dont think opera is qt based
[03:14] <fenrig> its past
[03:14] <rapid> osah: try that. if not you need vfat or fat32 enabled in your kernel. read a kernel-howto
[03:14] <flasher222> gnomefreak: i will still have kde things installed if what?
[03:14] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, you could try some partition/data recovery program, but dont get your hopes up
[03:14] <fenrig> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37364/
[03:14] <apokryphos> it is, but the version installed is probably got static-qt in it
[03:14] <gnomefreak> flasher222: if you use autoremove
[03:14] <apokryphos> actually, their deb might not
[03:14] <flasher222> gnomefreak: oh
[03:15] <seanh> CharminTheMoose - my windows user doesn't remember what the username or password might be (windows never asks for it, but won't tell you what it is either)
[03:15] <elSandros> When I boot of a DVD containing Ubuntu, and choose "Install or boot Ubuntu" (or something similar), am I then supposed to go into ash?
[03:15] <apokryphos> flasher222: for these questions there's no point asking us :P. APT will *tell you* everything that it will do before it does it.
[03:15] <osah> i got   sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hdb1/media/fat
[03:15] <osah> doesnt seem to mount,, returns only help
[03:15] <nolimitsoya> elSandros, no, you are supposed to get a live environment with x
[03:15] <apokryphos> flasher222: so i.e. if it was going to remove opera, it would say that.
[03:15] <gnomefreak> flasher222: sudo apt-get remove --purge libqt3-mt   to get rid of all kde things (along with everything qt based
[03:15] <elSandros> hm... crap
[03:15] <flasher222> so if i want to remove kde things (i'm guessing you mean libraries, etc), i should do as you said "remove libqy3-mt"? yes+
[03:15] <mrabbit> osah:try a space between hdb1 and media
[03:16] <nolimitsoya> elSandros, try safe graphics mode, or the alternate install cd for a cli install
[03:16] <fenrig> can sombody help me with the nvidia driver?
[03:16] <elSandros> nolimitsoya: will do...
[03:16] <mrabbit> like 'sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hdb1 /media/fat'
[03:16] <gnomefreak> fenrig: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[03:16] <osah> mount point /media/fat does not exist
[03:16] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, it doesnt matter this error.. not much, but 10gb is a bit :P
[03:16] <elSandros> though i don't fancy the idea of a cli install
[03:16] <Nippoo> anyone know what utility I use to make something like this: http://www.ubuntu.com/include/testing/flight2/bootchart-big.png
[03:16] <mrabbit> try 'sudo mkdir /media/fat' first
[03:16] <CharminTheMoose> gnomefreak:what about apt-get remove --purge kde* libqt3*?
[03:16] <Fozzie> I LOVE UBUNTU
[03:16] <Fozzie> Thanks for help everyone
[03:16] <flasher222> doing " sudo apt-get remove --purge libqt3-mt" will remove opera
[03:16] <gnomefreak> CharminTheMoose: dont need to libqt3-mt will remove everything kde
[03:17] <flasher222> Fozzie: UBunt loves you.
[03:17] <nolimitsoya> elSandros, its no biggie realy. its almost as straight forward as the ubiquity installer
[03:17] <CharminTheMoose> gnomefreak,ah
[03:17] <osah> it says  wrong fs type... (by the way hdb1 is a extended partition, not logical..)
[03:17] <fenrig> it said nothing is upgrade or changed
[03:17] <elSandros> i'll try it then:)
[03:17] <fenrig> strange
[03:17] <gnomefreak> fenrig: apt-cache policy nvidia-glx
[03:17] <seanh> CharminTheMoose - so it should be the Windows user name and password I use to mount the share?
[03:17] <gnomefreak> fenrig: pastebin what it says
[03:17] <mgpalmer> Hello ! I wonder if there's a more sophisticated way to adjust the mouse settings than the GUI Panel ? Because I'd like to have no acceleration but high speed...
[03:17] <MUTU> I downloaded the Ubuntu linux DVD from a torrent and I burned on my DVD-RW and it verified completely. But when trying to install it on my laptop, the DVD is giving Buffer I/O error on device hdc. Hardware problem?
[03:17] <frogzoo> Nippoo: that's pretty neat
[03:17] <mrabbit> what is the fat partition in hdb, cos u cant have an extended fat
[03:18] <CharminTheMoose> seanh:um,well to access it i would guess
[03:18] <mrabbit> osah:try with hdb2
[03:18] <osah> well  F: is NTFS, and  I: is Fat32 (extended off F:)
[03:18] <osah> hdb0 and hdb2 = does not exist error,  hdb1 (wrong fs type)
[03:19] <mrabbit> osah: try: sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hdb2 /media/fat
[03:19] <seanh> CharminTheMoose - the Windows Administrator account doesn't appear to have a password?
[03:19] <CharminTheMoose> seanh: really?
[03:19] <mrabbit> try hdb3
[03:20] <osah> is thgeree away to list all my hard drives, paritions
[03:20] <CharminTheMoose> seanh: then add a password
[03:20] <fenrig> ah
[03:20] <MUTU> I downloaded the Ubuntu linux DVD from a torrent and I burned on my DVD-RW and it verified completely. But when trying to install it on my laptop, the DVD is giving Buffer I/O error on device hdc. Hardware problem?
[03:20] <fenrig> can sombody
[03:20] <fenrig> help
[03:20] <seanh> CharminTheMoose - Windows never asks for one, if you access the share from another Windows machine it doesn't ask for one, we went into the Windows user settings, it says there is no password
[03:20] <fenrig> the nvidia driver is installed but
[03:20] <fenrig> the 3d acceleration isnt activeted or something
[03:20] <fenrig> it just doesnt works
[03:21] <mrabbit> osah: try: sudo fdisk -l
[03:21] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, some drives are picky about booting rw. try an -r
[03:21] <MUTU> nolimitsoya: it is DVD-R
[03:21] <fenrig> :(
[03:21] <MUTU> it kept on going though
[03:21] <MUTU> do i need to worry?
[03:21] <MUTU> it _did_ boot eventually i.e.
[03:22] <MUTU> but could it be corrupt?
[03:22] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, there is an option to check the disc in the boot menu
[03:22] <mrabbit> osah: does 'sudo fdisk -l' show you the fat partition on hdb?
[03:23] <frubi> hello
[03:23] <nolimitsoya> !hi | frubi
[03:23] <ubotu> frubi: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:23] <MUTU> what are the minimum requirements for ubuntu pls?
[03:23] <frubi> i have installed ubuntu on a ibook g4
[03:23] <mgpalmer> Hello again! I wonder if there's a more sophisticated way to adjust the mouse settings than the GUI Panel ? Because I'd like to have no acceleration but high speed...
[03:23] <mrabbit> osah:are you there?
[03:23] <frubi> but after the first reboot, there cames only a kernel panic
[03:23] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, hasnt we been through this already? 192mb to boot the live cd/dvd, but there is no clear minimum for running the installed system
[03:24] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, if youre on a realy old pc you might want xubuntu isntead of ubuntu
[03:24] <MUTU> oh, i have 128MB ::(
[03:24] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, then get xubuntu-desktop and use the alternate installer
[03:24] <MUTU> nolimitsoya: nah, i'll upgrade this junk :)
[03:25] <osah> mrabbit,
[03:25] <ppd> hi. how can I enable the "standby" button in my gnome logout menu?
[03:25] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, no, dont. thats a waste of money when you can get all the functionality for free by choosing another (imho better) window manager
[03:25] <osah> yes i keep getting   error :/ i cant seem to find the hdX for that hard drive i guess, how do i list all partitions?
[03:25] <mrabbit> osah:does 'sudo fdisk -l' show the fat partition on hdb
[03:26] <osah> yes i see it
[03:26] <osah> its hdb6
[03:26] <mrabbit> osah: try: sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hdb6 /media/fat
[03:27] <osah> sweet rabbit worked :) will the files always be there now?
[03:27] <MUTU> nolimitsoya: so only the window manager is different?
[03:27] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, yes. xubuntu uses xfce and ubuntu gnome
[03:27] <mrabbit> osah:have a look in the /media/fat folder
[03:27] <masura> anyone knows, where can be found cyrillic fonts for x-chat?
[03:27] <mrabbit> osah:then i'll tell how to make it mount on boot
[03:27] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, there is also the inofficial project fluxbuntu that uses fluxbox for wm
[03:27] <Duesentrieb> hi all. i'm running edgy, and just discovered that the text-mode virtual consoles no longer work (black screen).
[03:28] <osah> ok  /media/fat works
[03:28] <MUTU> nolimitsoya: hmm and they also look very similar
[03:28] <osah> has my files listed
[03:28] <Duesentrieb> is it possible that it no longer uses a "plain" crt mode?
[03:28] <mrabbit> osah:do you use gnome or kde?
[03:28] <nolimitsoya> !xubuntu | MUTU
[03:28] <ubotu> MUTU: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[03:28] <Duesentrieb> please help, i'm lost without text mode :(
[03:28] <osah> gnome, wish it was kde but gnome came with ubuntu
[03:28] <nolimitsoya> kubuntu ! osah
[03:28] <Duesentrieb> osah: use kubuntu then
[03:28] <mrabbit> osah: type: sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[03:28] <nolimitsoya> !kubuntu | osah
[03:28] <ubotu> osah: Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
[03:28] <rausb0> Duesentrieb: try adding vga=791 to grub boot options
[03:28] <seanh> Anyone know how I enter a server name with a space in it in fstab?
[03:29] <Duesentrieb> so... does anyone here have a clue how i get back my text terminal?
[03:29] <sharperguy> !wine
[03:29] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[03:29] <osah> sweet thx for kubuntu info.. ok gedit is open
[03:29] <jpjacobs> seanh, i guess escapeing the space with \
[03:29] <Duesentrieb> rausb0: ah. uh... why wasn't that necessary before? and what exactly does it do?
[03:29] <nolimitsoya> Duesentrieb, ctrl+alt+f1?
[03:29] <seanh> jpjacobs - doesn't seem to like that
[03:29] <Duesentrieb> nolimitsoya: that gives me a black screen. that's why i'm here.
[03:29] <rausb0> Duesentrieb: it selects 1024x768 vesa frame buffer as text mode
[03:29] <mrabbit> osah: add '/dev/hdb6 /media/fat vfat users,owner,rw,umask=000 0 0' to the end of the file and save
[03:29] <jpjacobs> seanh, it was just a guess
[03:29] <nolimitsoya> Duesentrieb, sudo apt-get install screen

[03:30] <MUTU> nolimitsoya, ubotu: how does the Ubuntu DVD compare to the xubuntu LiveCD + installer though?

[03:30] <Duesentrieb> rausb0: uh, for the virtual terminals, or for boot log?
[03:30] <rausb0> Duesentrieb: for the VTs
[03:30] <mrabbit> osah:just the text inside the ' signs, as a new line in the file, then save
[03:30] <Duesentrieb> rausb0: cool, thanks. sounds like this is it.
[03:30] <osah> mrabbit, saved
[03:30] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, im not sure what you mean... get the alternate installer and do a cli install. then apt-get xubuntu-desktop
[03:31] <ajax4> Hey everyone...just did a clean install of Edgy and everything went great. However, when I went to do the first batch of updates it hangs on update of the package gnome-games-data...anyone heard of this error?
[03:31] <osah> will the hdb6 appear in "My Computer" on ubuntu?
[03:31] <mrabbit> osah:now reboot and see if it is mounted when you are booted
[03:31] <nolimitsoya> osah dont
[03:31] <osah> :s ?
[03:31] <DARKGuy> Mornin' :) anybody wants to help me with some xterm issue? I know, it's weird :P but in my .Xresources I have "xterm*reverseVideo: true" to force black background and white text, but it only works when I run "xterm" from another terminal, because when I start xterm using the menu functions (I'm using fluxbox) it's white with black display. Is there a way to override that system-wide? :(
[03:31] <nolimitsoya> osah, you dont have to reboot to test that. just 'sudo mount -a'
[03:32] <MUTU> nolimitsoya: what I mean is that I have an ISO of Ubuntu which is 3.5GB and the ISO for xubuntu is < 600MB. Surely it's not just the window manager which is different?
[03:32] <mrabbit> osah:it should appear as *GB Volume: fat
[03:32] <mrabbit> osah:where * is size of partition
[03:32] <osah> where will it appear
[03:32] <osah> on   My Computer?
[03:32] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, the dvd contains many of the most popular packages that are not in the default install. those are not on the cd.
[03:32] <Jordan_U> MTU: No, xubuntu also has lighter weight applications
[03:32] <mrabbit> osah:yes it will next to 'filesystem'
[03:32] <amortvigil> how can i find my usb mout point?
[03:32] <osah> ok  mount -a  did not make it appear
[03:32] <jpjacobs> seanh, see pm
[03:33] <mrabbit> osah:try rebooting, thats what i did when i mounted my partitions the other day
[03:33] <nolimitsoya> osah, dont reboot

[03:33] <Enquest> if I buy a monitor with screen resolution 1920 1205... Is it then possible to say to gnome that windows should open: the first window left 1000px second window 920px. I want them to fit nicly
[03:33] <Enquest> Or should I realy have two monitors ?
[03:34] <osah> nolimitsoya:  mount -a  did not return an error, but neither did it add the filesystem to my computer
[03:34] <MUTU> nolimitsoya: but those packages can be installed later from the internet or from the ubuntu DVD if i install xubuntu?
[03:34] <mrabbit> nolimitsoya:in order to test whether something works on boot, one must try booting
[03:34] <mrabbit> nolimitsoya:logic
[03:34] <nolimitsoya> osah, jhave you checked the dir where it was supposed tomount?
[03:34] <nolimitsoya> mrabbit, in this case thats false :)
[03:34] <nolimitsoya> MUTU, yes
[03:34] <MUTU> thanks nolimitsoya
[03:35] <osah> yes
[03:35] <mrabbit> nolimitsoya:it is already mounted, because i told him the manual command, but its time to test whether the fstab entry works
[03:35] <desert88> hey guys
[03:35] <osah> the dir shows files 'ls'

[03:35] <desert88> ok
[03:35] <DARKGuy> mrabbit: to test the fstab there's no need to reboot, actually
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> osah, try mount -l to see what filesystems are mounted where
[03:35] <masura> hihi
[03:35] <osah> '/dev/hdb6 /media/fat vfat users,owner,rw,umask=000 0 0'

[03:36] <osah> but i do not see it under 'my computer'
[03:36] <nolimitsoya> osah, you arent supposed to
[03:36] <osah> i can only access it  by going   cd /media/fat
[03:36] <osah> oh, can i add it somehow to MY Computer
[03:37] <root_> hi, I have Ubuntu Edgy, and at start of XServer (after one apt... dist-upgrade) say that missing font fixed, which package do I have to install, to fix it?
[03:37] <nolimitsoya> osah, read up on mounting if things are unclear :) in unix, everything is a file. even folders are files. drives are accessed by making them files. if you want that file to be in a particular place, just mount there :)
[03:37] <mrabbit> osah:try rebooting, mine appeared in my computer after reboot, and just use nautilus file manager in gnome to navigate for /media/fat so you dont have to use cd commands all the time
[03:37] <nolimitsoya> osah, dont reboot
[03:38] <nolimitsoya> osah, if you want to try that, just save all your work and press ctrl+alt+backspace. a linux machine never has to be rebooted, uless you want to switch kernel
[03:38] <mrabbit> nolimitsoya:i dont know where you've developed your fear of rebooting
[03:38] <osah> oh i see :)
[03:38] <mrabbit> ah, i never knew that
[03:38] <nolimitsoya> mrabbit, its a fobia of mine :)
[03:38] <DARKGuy> It's not really fear, it's just that it isn't needed as it is in Windows :P
[03:38] <root_> nolimitsoya: please say about the XServer issue :)
[03:38] <IndyGUnFreak> i wouldn't say "never" has to be rebooted
[03:38] <karim> ubuntu doesn't want to supppoort PPC anymore ? That's really a joke.
[03:38] <nolimitsoya> root_, ?
[03:38] <mrabbit> nolimitsoya: you mean 'phobia'
[03:38] <root_> nolimitsoya: I need to have font fixed
=== root_ is now known as ciplogic
[03:39] <ciplogic> :)
[03:39] <nolimitsoya> mrabbit, i might, yes. english is not my naitive language
[03:39] <IndyGUnFreak> i installed a bunch of updates yesterday, adn it told me i had to reboot in order for them to take effect
[03:39] <ciplogic> nolimitsoya: there was a bug in Ubuntu that I connect to irssi using sudo su - :)
[03:39] <mrabbit> right, now can somebody please help with my slow torrent problem
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> ciplogic, what about it?
[03:40] <ciplogic> nolimitsoya: do you know which package have font "fixed" from XServer?
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> root_, be specific
[03:40] <IndyGUnFreak> mrabbit, are you using a hardware firewall/router?
[03:40] <osah> ctrl+alt+backspace, logged me off... :)
[03:40] <osah> hey if i do not save my workspace will it not save the updates i did etc..?
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> osah, its supposed to :)
[03:40] <osah> and how do i save the workspace anyways
[03:40] <mrabbit> indygunfreak:yes a router, but it is fine cos torrents worked fine in suse on this laptop
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> osah, i told you to save your work
[03:41] <pr3d4t0r> Good morning.
[03:41] <osah> nolimitsoya, how do i do that :)
[03:41] <Jordan_U> IndyGUnFreak: It often says that even when you don't need to because, for instance, not everyone would know what " restart X for changes to affect " means
[03:41] <IndyGUnFreak> i'm not super familiar with it, but i know you  need to do whats caleld "port forwarding"
[03:41] <jimr1603> hi all
[03:41] <nolimitsoya> ciplogic, be specific please. i dont knowwhat you are talking about
[03:41] <mrabbit> osah:just save any documents you have open
[03:41] <mrabbit> osah:so you dont lose anything ur editing
[03:41] <osah> mrabbit, goto http://192.168.1.1/  to forward ports :)
[03:41] <nolimitsoya> osah, just click the 'save' button in openoffice, fex
[03:41] <osah> oh so im not losing updates i did last night like 100 somewhat packages
[03:41] <nolimitsoya> osah, nope
[03:41] <poningru> osah: naah
[03:42] <mrabbit> osah:my ports are forwarded fine on my router
[03:42] <ciplogic> nolimitsoya: the X server starts, and at start it said to me: missing font "fixed" and that is because of unsuccessful update after a "dist-upgrade"
[03:42] <osah> because i just logged back in and its downloading 50 somewhat packages again thats why i was wondering
[03:42] <nolimitsoya> osah, ctrl+alt+backspace kills your graphical environment. it does nothing to your files
[03:42] <nolimitsoya> osah, then these are new packages
[03:42] <ciplogic> nolimitsoya: the solution is to install the package of xserver which has support for standard XServer fonts
[03:42] <pr3d4t0r> Q. I believe that my upgrade from Dapper to Edgy went well; I just rebooted the system and it came back up.  What is the way to confirm that Edgy is the current release running on the box?  How do I check if this (headless) system is coming up with Upstart instead of /sbin/init ?  Thanks in advance.
[03:42] <nolimitsoya> ciplogic, xfonts-base
[03:42] <seanh> I just mounted a samba share following the MountWindowsSharesPermanently guide. Now I have a folder on the desktop where the share is mounted, but only root can write to the folder. BUT I also see the share in Places->Network Servers at the top level cause it's mounted now, and if I go to it that way anyone can write to it. Is there any way to mount the share that way without mounting it to a folder?
[03:42] <osah> hey if i want KDE (kubuntu) would i need to remove this gnome version one? :/

[03:44] <jimr1603> hi, does anybody know where i can get the inf file for Atheros AR5005G? It's an internal card so I don't have an install cd or anything for it.
[03:44] <pr3d4t0r> IndyGUnFreak: cat /etc/lvs-release says "Edgy" and "6.10" - is there any software that would confirm that?
[03:44] <nolimitsoya> osah, yes, but thats real easy :) just 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config enable'
[03:44] <nolimitsoya> osah, do you have your /home on a separate partition?
[03:44] <osah> well i had to do much more some grep stuff etc.. someone guided me through
[03:45] <nolimitsoya> osah, you usualy dont have to. thats just if youve messed with your xorg.conf before. btwm you can just backup your xorg.conf and reinsert it aterwards, and youre all fine :)

[03:50] <Jordan_U> rade0n: that's odd, did you try changeing the user agent string?

[03:52] <mrabbit_> i read that by default, all ports are closed until an app tries to listen on them
[03:52] <osah> is xfce hard to setup... fluxbox wasnt that hard with some tuts

[04:04] <diskus> probably /usr/local/bin
[04:04] <Alakazamz0r> well, its not just a binary though diskus
[04:04] <Alakazamz0r> its all kindsa stuff.
[04:05] <diskus> then /usr/local?
[04:05] <apokryphos> Alakazamz0r: thunderbird is available in the repositories
[04:05] <diskus> but I prefer /opt
[04:05] <apokryphos> Alakazamz0r: do you really mean "precompiled" or do you mean "manually compiled"?
[04:05] <Seamus7> Hi.... after I tried updating my graphics card driver, my system freezes at the login screen .... how do I switch back to the standard ubuntu video driver in recovery mode or using my Linux Rescue CD?
[04:05] <Alakazamz0r> good call diskus
[04:05] <Alakazamz0r> thanks!
[04:05] <lasse> Seamus, recovery mode
[04:06] <diskus> I had nice script long time ago, it just symlinked all the progs from /opt to /usr/local
[04:06] <Seamus7> lasse: do you know the commad to switch back?
[04:06] <Jordan_U> Seamus7: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[04:06] <pr3d4t0r> apokryphos: http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=11642 - it looks like it's installed but I can't see it running.  I see init.  I found /usr/lib/upstart and others on the disk, though.
[04:07] <Seamus7> Jordan_U: thanks .... what's the  -phigh for?
[04:07] <lasse> Seamus, what kind of video card have you got and what drivers are you now using / did you use before?
[04:07] <thcrw8383> dose anyone know how to change the icons in the notification-area in Gnome?
[04:07] <rade0n> Jordan_U, did you see it?
[04:07] <Jordan_U> Seamus7: Tells it to only ask hight priority questions
[04:08] <Seamus7> lasse: I have a Radeon Mobile X1300 .... I had the ATI propietary drivers installed successfully but was updating them to the newest version ... I'm on Edgy
[04:08] <pr3d4t0r> apokryphos: Is there some unequivocal way of checking?
[04:08] <Zodia1> im so toast XD
[04:08] <Zodia1> i tryed to fix the problem, and now my windows dont work!
[04:08] <apokryphos> pr3d4t0r: I'm really not sure about the way upstart works. This may help:
[04:09] <lasse> Seamus7, then you can also edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and set it from fglrx to ati...
[04:09] <apokryphos> ubotu: upstart
[04:09] <ubotu> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[04:09] <Zodia1> so im on live cd <.<
[04:09] <Seamus7> lasse: thanks I'll look into that ...
[04:10] <Zodia1> nolimitsoya, should i just install ubuntu over Windows since windows dont work? Is it possible to get access to my windows HDD via Ubuntu live cD?
[04:10] <desert88> hey Im trying to install banshee audio player and am having some trouble is there anyone who would be willing to help in private chat?
[04:10] <pr3d4t0r> apokryphos: OKi, reading that -- thanks!
[04:11] <AieronPeters> hi.. can someone help me install ipmi onto a Dell 1425sc rack server? Running Edgy server...
[04:11] <pip> Hello
[04:11] <desert88> so can anyone help me install banshee in private chat?
[04:11] <Zodia1> should i just install ubuntu over Windows since windows dont work? Is it possible to get access to my windows HDD via Ubuntu live cD?
[04:11] <apokryphos> desert88: what's hard about reading the FAQ?
[04:11] <desert88> i did
[04:11] <desert88> and I understood
[04:11] <desert88> it just fine
[04:11] <apokryphos> desert88: it tells you *exactly* how to install packages
[04:11] <pip> who use skype ?
[04:12] <Nippoo> me.
[04:12] <pip> I got a problem with it
[04:12] <pip> Nippoo, Hi
[04:12] <desert88> ok I know how to install packages
[04:12] <javaJake> On Xubuntu, what do I run to get my laptop to attempt a PPP connection to this computer?
[04:12] <Nippoo> hey pip.
[04:12] <javaJake> I've got PPPD running on this laptop
[04:12] <desert88> the problem is Im trying to append the sourcelist which i am able to do to install a new repository
[04:12] <pip> Nippoo, I bought a new mic this afternoon but others can not hear my voice
[04:12] <desert88> but i get an error
[04:12] <desert88> in the terminal
[04:12] <pip> Nippoo, I think the settings must be wrong
[04:12] <desert88> after running apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:12] <apokryphos> desert88: and of course the question we're waiting for is "what error?"
[04:12] <Nippoo> pip: phone "echo123"
[04:13] <Nippoo> (it's a test)
[04:13] <apokryphos> desert88: why are you running dist-upgrade?
[04:13] <Nippoo> tell me what you get
[04:13] <pip> Nippoo,so I want to know the correct settings with mic in skype
[04:13] <javaJake> Can anyone help?
[04:13] <desert88> well the repository which includes banshee isn't on synaptics
[04:13] <Nippoo> pip: what, on ubuntu?

[04:14] <Bertjen> Hello all, I was woundering, is there an install CD for my cpu architecture (Intel Core 2 Duo)? like Suse has (x86_64)
[04:15] <b08y> Bertjen: yeah should be
[04:15] <apokryphos> Bertjen: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[04:16] <Darren> Hello?
[04:16] <Infeliz> hi?
[04:16] <Bertjen> apokryphos, if I looked correct my question isn't answerred in that document
[04:16] <Bertjen> I know I can take i386, that would be no problem
[04:16] <Darren> Ummm anybody have trouble with the DWL-G520 card?
[04:16] <apokryphos> Bertjen: the document tells you that there's a 64bit install, so perhaps you didn't
[04:17] <Bertjen> really?
[04:17] <apokryphos> yes
[04:17] <Bertjen> I only see a 64bit install for amd :(
[04:17] <apokryphos> nope, your processor is supported as well
[04:17] <b08y> Bertjen: thats the same :)
[04:17] <Bertjen> I didn't know that! :p
[04:18] <apokryphos> they're not the same, but it's 64-bit as well
[04:18] <sadf> I have a problem... Dapper Drake on amd64... the icons I use to launch programs mostly fail now, especially admin stuff.  I get no error message, it simply fails to launch.
[04:18] <Darren> I cannot connect to my network.
[04:18] <b08y> btw, read that part from faq, cause there is some info, like ucant use wine,ect. on 64Bit
[04:18] <Darren> Flash, w32 codecs, and WINE
[04:18] <sadf> I'd happily trade this 64bit for a 32bit if it was mine.
[04:18] <Bertjen> I just saw, didn't knew that either :(
[04:19] <Bertjen> and that really sucks :p
[04:19] <apokryphos> sadf: why?
[04:19] <Ace2016> hi all
[04:19] <b08y> sadf: what happens if u start that apps from terminal?
[04:19] <Ace2016> Is there a software raid guide for ubuntu?
[04:19] <apokryphos> sadf: I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that it's a 64-bit install
[04:19] <Ace2016> will a software raid increase startup time?
[04:19] <apokryphos> Uboon2: raid
[04:19] <apokryphos> ubotu: raid
[04:19] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[04:19] <Ace2016> i mean will it make the system get to the desktop faster
[04:20] <osah> help :(
[04:20] <b08y> Ace2016: good question ;)
[04:20] <thcrw8383> how do you change the icons in the notification area?
[04:20] <apokryphos> !msg | sadf
[04:20] <ubotu> sadf: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[04:20] <b08y> thcrw8383: hmm, special app?
[04:21] <osah> who helped me earlier
[04:21] <osah> ? i just lost the nickname
[04:21] <Darren> So can anybody tell me why my DWL-G520 isn't functioning properly in ubuntu?
[04:21] <TheGateKeeper> Ace2016: not got personal experience but I would have thought all RAID will do is give you resliance when thinks go wrong
[04:21] <b08y> thcrw8383: i think there is no general answer cause, its the question of that map, used to be in the notification area
[04:22] <Ace2016> TheGateKeeper: wouldn't the system be able to access info faster since there are two disks?
[04:22] <TheGateKeeper> Ace2016: if you want speed look at arch linux of a source based linux like gentoo or sourcemage
[04:22] <b08y> Darren: edgy?
[04:22] <Darren> Yup
[04:22] <karim> there is still no known way to use ATI mpeg2 decompressor ?
[04:22] <Ace2016> tried gentoo, didn't feel that much faster
[04:22] <osah> can someone help me, i tried to update packages using ubuntu-update.. it got stuck so i just rebooted the pc.. now when i try to run ubuntu it wont start i get a blue screen saying  xorg.conf somethiong.. it doesnt detect i guess mouse,keyboard nothing :(
[04:22] <Darren> I tried ndiswrapper, that didn't work out.
[04:22] <osah> any suggestions :/ and when i go to windows (dualk boot) the windows freezes
[04:23] <osah> i also added a fat32 partition to ubuntu before that using  mount...
[04:23] <sadf> sorry for the direct mesgs, not used to this client, I thought I was responding to msgs
[04:23] <osah> and added it to fstab
[04:23] <lasse> osah, the error in ubuntu has nothing to do with windows
[04:23] <lasse> osah, what kind of video card have you got? ati nvidia or intel?
[04:23] <TheGateKeeper> Ace2016: ubuntu is slow because it's not optimsed for i686 processors & alike
[04:23] <christiane> Hello. I installed 6.10 on /dev/sda6. Now I repartitioned, created a new /dev/sda6 while my old /dev/sda6 is now /dev/sda7, copied all files from new 7 to new 6 and booted grub (which loaded new 6 as /). Now ubuntu is running, / is the new 6 (I can see the new size of /), but it's called /dev/sda7. WTF happened here?
[04:24] <osah> lasse nvidia.. i see the nvidia screen then the screen turns black... then i see nvidia again.. turns black.. then blue screen comes.

[04:24] <osah> saying x cannot start...
[04:24] <osah> it worked fine before i did the update packages :/
[04:24] <b08y> say osah, login via ctrl-alt-f1
[04:24] <Darren> I tried connecting to my dlink router, but still no internet.
[04:24] <osah> b08y if i try that i get  bash premission denied like 100 times :/
[04:24] <lasse> osah, im sorry, i know nothing about nvidia. but you can always edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf so it uses the vesa driver
[04:24] <Ace2016> TheGateKeeper: but the time an app takes to start depends mostly on disk throughput right?
[04:24] <osah> something broke ubuntu :/
[04:25] <b08y> osah: u cant login?
[04:25] <slicky> are the gigabyte superG wifi card supported by linux?

[04:28] <psy_unix> where you come from danilo ???
[04:28] <b08y> Lobo__: from key to script or script to key?
[04:28] <Lobo__> script to key
[04:29] <b08y> hmm, that way i dont know
[04:29] <Ace2016> TheGateKeeper: I don't want to compile stuff anymore, the time i spend compiling stuff is better spent just putting up with the slowness
[04:29] <b08y> but there should be something like that
[04:29] <sadf> So if click an icon and it says "application starting" but then vanishes and the application never starts and an error message never appears, where would I start troubleshooting?  Just a hint, a clue, anything :)
[04:29] <Lobo__> i'll try a forum ... thx anyway

[04:40] <pr3d4t0r> apokryphos: Hej.  Thanks for your help.  It looks like, when upgrading, all Upstart does is create a number of wrappers for rc*.d within it.  I'm still validating whether the system starts with init or Upstart to be 100% sure.  So far, though, every indication is that it does.  If someone wants to check that, have them look at whether /lib/upstart exist and /etc/event.d has the runlevel wrappers.

[05:01] <Owner> i just wondered
[05:02] <Varanger> how can I install codecs for watching xvid file to gstreamer???
[05:02] <MetaMorfoziS> is there a way to speed up inkscape? it's painly slow:(
[05:02] <Varanger> I meant which codec is needed (sudo apt-get install .....)
[05:02] <drkm> what do I need to put into my xorg.conf to get my resolution at 1600x1200 at refresh rate 50? because what I'm doing isn't working..
[05:02] <rpiercy> osah sorry, they are built in now, let me think for a second - I had this problem too
[05:02] <Leetlandon> But when i do that i shows the Ubuntu splash screen with the orange bar.. But once it gets passed that it goes into like a ticker.
[05:03] <Leetlandon> Like 30 times a second something comes up.
[05:03] <mrabbit> hello, i read that ubuntu has all ports blocked by default, and i think if that is true it is the cause of my prob
[05:03] <Owner> i have ubuntu and havent got an internet connection on that pc at the minute, is there a way i can download Wine on this pc and transfer it to my other pc via disc or something?
[05:03] <seanh> I got a laptop here that is very quiet -- even with all the volumes turned right up, it is much quieter than it should be. I tried alsamixer, but everything it turned up. Any ideas?
[05:03] <Pelo> Leetlandon,  that is normal
[05:03] <Leetlandon> Alright, I ran it all night, it got to like 20000 and still nothing?
[05:03] <Pelo> Leetlandon,  ok now that isn't normal
[05:04] <Leetlandon> Yeah.
[05:04] <Pelo> Leetlandon,  try making a new cd  and yours might be borked
[05:04] <Owner> i have ubuntu and havent got an internet connection on that pc at the minute, is there a way i can download Wine on this pc and transfer it to my other pc via disc or something?
[05:04] <osah> rpiercy: i downloaded some updates using apt-get and it got stuck updating some  libc.. file it said something "font ... error.." so i rebooted and thats what happened.
[05:04] <Leetlandon> Hmm, alright.
[05:04] <[BTF] Chm0d> Uboon2: here is a link to the kiba i d/led today

[05:06] <seanh> Okay so I'm about to use GParted to shrink an NTFS partition on an external USB drive. Does the USB mean it's more likely to fail?
[05:06] <[BTF] Chm0d> instead of configuring
[05:06] <Pelo> Owner,  .deb packages are the install files for debian and debian fork distros
[05:06] <Owner> so do i just write the .deb file to a disc and put it into my ubuntu pc to install
[05:06] <Pelo> Owner,  yeah

[05:22] <manmadha> >
[05:22] <nolimitsoya> Ace2016, yes and no. read the links; especialy the linux docu project one
[05:23] <nolimitsoya> manmadha, there is no such thing.
[05:23] <skmidry__> manmadha - do you need to know open ports on an ip?
[05:23] <skmidry__> then that is possible
[05:23] <manmadha> skmidry__, By default the ip numbers are blocked by our ISP
[05:23] <nolimitsoya> manmadha, ip:s dont have open ports. a computer has an ip, and a computer has many ports.
[05:23] <manmadha> But...
[05:23] <manmadha> nolimitsoya, yaa u r correct...It is possible in two cases

[05:34] <rainmakers99> for ubuntu does anyone know the name of the package to install for the kernel source  I have version 2.6.15-27-386
[05:34] <QwertyM> enkidu, in sessions selection menu at GDM, it has a safe gnome session which loads w/o startup scripts, in case somethings playing mischief
[05:34] <nolimitsoya> enkidu, just tell her to press ctrl+alt+f2 and log in, and then type "sudo apt-get clean"
[05:34] <slacker> rainmakers99: I assume you want the kernelheaders?
[05:34] <rainmakers99> yes.
[05:34] <rainmakers99> for driver programmin
[05:35] <nolimitsoya> enkidu, that should free up some space in /, and solve thing provided /home is not a separate partition. its also pretty harmless
[05:35] <slacker> rainmakers99: apt-cache search kernel | grep 2.6.15-27-386 will probably give you the correct pacakge
[05:35] <nolimitsoya> enkidu, harmless meaning its very har to misstype things in a way that realy causes any big problems...

[05:38] <jpjacobs> mrabbit, try lshw

[05:39] <giga> my beryl installation keeps crashing, it has built-in via graphics chip, fairly new. Would a nvidia gfx card help?
[05:39] <rambo3> giga, what oart of beta software and #ubuntu.xgl is that
[05:40] <mrabbit> green_earz:thanks, it worked
[05:40] <mrabbit> jpjacobs:thanks for trying
[05:40] <jpjacobs> hmmm maybe some arguments you have to provide to the module? i had something similar with a webcam, there the solution was to add force_palette=15 to the modprobe ov511 ..
[05:40] <rambo3> modinfo  ov511 then ?
[05:41] <enkidu> nolimitsoya, QwertyM: thanks, I wrote her an email to tell her how to apt-get clean her computer
[05:41] <ADD> ok...how do i do that
[05:41] <jpjacobs> ADD try the modinfo pwc
[05:42] <ADD> just type modinfo pwc?
[05:42] <j_oker2> Anyone around that knows networking fairly well?  I have a question about my linux router setup...
[05:42] <jpjacobs> ADD indeed
[05:42] <rambo3> yeah see parm : and you can brind down module and modprobe it with param=value
[05:42] <green_earz> enkidu: have a look at using vnc to the remote machine so you can maintian it in the future.
[05:42] <dfcarney> j_oker2: I know a bit.  Regardless, please just ask your question -- if someone can help, they will :)
[05:42] <giga> ditto, i know a fair amount
[05:43] <enkidu> green_earz: she's behind a router
[05:43] <wims> my mouse pointer is scrambled on my second monitor after installing ATi drivers, but everything else looks allright, anybody have an idea on how to fix it *?
[05:43] <IceTox> Anyone here knows if skype comes with webcam support for debian/ubuntu?
[05:44] <enkidu> green_earz: and I don't think vnc is active before gdm, is it ?
[05:44] <ADD> Ok, i did that.  now what am i looking for specifically?
[05:44] <hassan> IceTox: no it does not
[05:44] <j_oker2> I setup IPCop as my router/dhcp and I setup a 2003 server as my dns server and domain.  I have 2 linksys routers I am using as switches.  Since I put all this in, i can't get my media center and my xbox to work together.  I think i need to create some kind of route between them but am unsure how.
[05:44] <giga> My mouse gets all freaky whenever I swith PCs with my kvm switch. Anyway to fix?
[05:44] <IceTox> hassan: ok, thanks for a short answer :)
[05:44] <hassan> IceTox: i use Ekiga for that
[05:44] <IceTox> hassan: yeah but I'm gonna communicate with my brother that uses windows.
[05:45] <hassan> IceTox: gyach is a yahoo client that supports webcam
[05:45] <jpjacobs> ADD, have you googled for this stuff?
[05:45] <rambo3> ADD see parm : and you can brind down module and modprobe it with param=value
[05:45] <IceTox> well, amsn 0.97 supports it as well hassan, but I'm not able to see myself..
[05:45] <ADD> for the last 3 days.  and found nothing to help
[05:45] <dfcarney> j_oker2: how are the routers connected?  Where are the 2003 server, the xbox, and your media center attached?
[05:45] <giga> icetox: ditto, thier webcam works but not mine
[05:46] <green_earz> enkidu: that ok if the router will do port forwarding and use ssh to connect,
[05:46] <hassan> mmm
[05:46] <giga> any1 here use kvm swiched between ubuntu installs?
[05:46] <hassan> giga: yes me
[05:46] <Slart> giga: there are some kvm switches with built in mouse support..
[05:46] <seanh> Can anyone recommend me a reliable GUI backup tool for EDGY? Need to backup 70GB to DVDs
[05:46] <nolimitsoya> seanh, hubackup
[05:46] <ADD> this is frustrating
[05:47] <Slart> giga: or not support.. mouse emulation was the word I was looking for
[05:47] <j_oker2> dfcarney the ipcop router goes to the 8 port switch.  the media center and server are on that switch.  a 4 port wireless switch is connected to the 8 port switch as well.  The xbox is on the 4 port.
[05:47] <jpjacobs> ADD, i really don't know how to solve your problem
=== rambo3 is now known as Remove_my__ban_W
[05:47] <ValMarko> Firewall. Do I need to install?
[05:47] <seanh> nolimitosya - hubackup does not work fully yet
[05:47] <JQG> hi,how to write a shell that can monitor the network connection avaliable,if invaliable then retry to connect with pon dsl-provider:)
=== Remove_my__ban_W is now known as ban_Wolfpaws
[05:47] <ADD> ok...thanks anyway, jp
[05:47] <n2diy> I'm testing a backup/restore routine, and after restoring /home and /etc to my test box, X won't start. How can I config it from the command line?
[05:47] <dfcarney> j_oker2: do things work if you connect the xbox to the 8-port instead?  (i.e. as a test)
[05:47] <nolimitsoya> seanh, still the best there is. use tar/p7zip, and split to the right size is the other option
[05:47] <giga> how do you send a message to one specific user?
[05:48] <Music_Shuffle> giga, on IRC?
[05:48] <nolimitsoya> giga, /msg
[05:48] <giga> ya music_shuffle
[05:48] <hassan> giga: i have stopped using kvm, i use synergy (2 screens 1 mouse 1 keyb)
[05:48] <Music_Shuffle> ^
[05:48] <seanh> nolimitsoya - Do you know what parts of hubackup work and don't work so far?
[05:48] <Music_Shuffle> !pm
[05:48] <ubotu> Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[05:48] <Music_Shuffle> Err...that doesn't read as you'd expect. Lol.
[05:48] <j_oker2> dfcarney: I have to go disconnect and try, one moment.  I CAN ping from the media center to the xbox however...
[05:48] <giga> hassan, what hardware do u need for synergy?
[05:48] <nolimitsoya> seanh, nope. i dont use it. i tried it once though, and it seemed pretty functional tome
[05:48] <hassan> network connection
[05:49] <hassan> 2 screens
[05:49] <giga> crap
[05:49] <dfcarney> j_oker2: can you ping in the other direction?  Does the xbox have that functionality?
[05:49] <nolimitsoya> giga, as i said, use /msg
[05:49] <nolimitsoya> giga, or /query if youd prefer
[05:49] <seanh> nolimitsoya - I tested it, it created dar files but could not restore them
[05:49] <wildchild> is there any tool to encrypt file?
[05:49] <j_oker2> DFCarney, wait, I can't even ping the xbox...are teh two segments not working together?
[05:49] <nolimitsoya> seanh, cant you just unzip them?
[05:50] <JQG> hi,how to write a shell that can monitor the network connection avaliable,if invaliable then retry to connect with pon dsl-provider:)
[05:50] <seanh> nolimitsoya -- I dunno, using command line dar?
[05:50] <dfcarney> j_oker2: maybe, maybe not.  I don't know if the xbox has support to respond to pings.
[05:50] <dfcarney> j_oker2: can you telnet or FTP to it?
[05:50] <nolimitsoya> seanh, yes
[05:50] <j_oker2> Let me take the other router of the equation, hold on (NO, its not modded, it doesn't have that ability)
[05:50] <Slart> This might be a question everyone asks.. but I haven't found anything in the faq, nor did google help me. How can I select what drives end up on my desktop? I still want some of them.. just not all
[05:51] <seanh> nolimitsoya - hmm.. i'll test it
[05:51] <nolimitsoya> Slart, thats done on a very low level. i doubt youll have any control over it
[05:51] <Slart> oh.. and I'm running Ubuntu 6.10, Gnome version
[05:52] <Slart> nolimitsoya: bah.. so I'll have to unmount some drives to make them disappear
[05:52] <nolimitsoya> Slart, i have no idea, im not running gnome :) i think you would though...
[05:52] <Slart> nolimitsoya: ok, thanks for your help
[05:53] <Slart> nolimitsoya: oh, one more thing.. is gnome responsible for creating those shortcuts..or some other software running?
[05:53] <nolimitsoya> Slart, that should be gnome/nautilus, on a hal level
[05:54] <dromer> hey all, I'm having trouble getting mplayer to play certain streaming media (mplayer-plugin)
[05:54] <ValMarko> Should I install Firestarter since ubuntu has a builted-in firewall?
[05:54] <dromer> the plugin connects to the media, and starts buffering, but eventually doesn't play
[05:54] <Slart> nolimitsoya: ok, thanks again
[05:54] <nolimitsoya> ValMarko, ubuntu doesnt have a built in firewall
[05:54] <Seveas> !firewall
[05:54] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[05:54] <jpjacobs> dromer: happens with the most recent wmv stuff i guess
=== linuxboy_ is now known as linuxboy
[05:55] <dromer> jpjacobs: this is with .asf
[05:55] <nolimitsoya> ValMarko, note the diffrence between 'built in firewall _capability_' and 'built in firewall'
[05:55] <ValMarko> youre right
[05:56] <dfcarney> nolimitsoya: what's the difference?
[05:56] <compengi> in the terminal what command can show me the size of the files in a folder
[05:56] <nolimitsoya> dfcarney, ubuntu has all the tools, but they arent configured
[05:56] <dfcarney> nolimitsoya: gotcha.
[05:56] <ValMarko> Should I install Firestarter or... is there a better one?
[05:57] <kitche> ValMarko: better what?
[05:57] <nolimitsoya> ValMarko, running standard ubuntu, you should install firestarter
[05:57] <compengi> ValMarko, firestarter is good
[05:57] <j_oker2> DFCarney: even with the 2nd router gone, still nto working...weird
[05:57] <ValMarko> tanks
[05:57] <dfcarney> j_oker2: yeah, that's strange.  Does the xbox get an IP address when you start it up?
[05:57] <compengi> ValMarko, cans ;)
[05:58] <kane77> hi
[05:59] <dfcarney> j_oker2: I believe that you have to configure it for DHCP (at least, that's what you have to do for a modded xbox)
[05:59] <j_oker2> yes, it gets an ip, pulls dns servers from the 2003 server.  It gets on xbox live.
[05:59] <j_oker2> I've done that.  It looks like my IPCop is blocking port 3776.  I keep getting a denied on that port for some reason from xbox
[06:00] <dfcarney> j_oker2: all right...  Can you connect to your media center from another PC?  Likewise, can your media center connect to something other than the xbox?
[06:00] <compengi> in the terminal what command can show me the size of the files in a folder
[06:00] <dfcarney> j_oker2: You realize that your inquiry isn't ubuntu-specific, right?  :)
[06:00] <j_oker2> yes it can
[06:00] <dfcarney> compengi: du -sh *
[06:00] <j_oker2> I do, i certainly know, but no other channels would answer.
[06:01] <jpjacobs> compengi, du -hc
[06:01] <dfcarney> compengi: or "ls -al"
[06:01] <Almodovar> hello there, I've installed ubu5.10 on a dual core, only the server part, how can I upgrade that via console?and repositories are not working that well either...
[06:01] <n2diy> I'm testing a backup/restore routine, and after restoring /home and /etc to my test box, X won't start. How can I config it from the command line?
[06:01] <j_oker2> i realize now that the ipcop is blocking ports.  let me look into guys and see if i can't find an answer now that i know the problem.  i appreciate the help
[06:03] <puyi> tesing
[06:03] <nolimitsoya> j_oker2, just log onto ipcops webconfig utility and forward the port
[06:03] <Wooksta> if i want to install mysql, apache, php, etc but want to use my system as a desktop / development / workstation should i use the ubuntu server or desktop edition?
[06:04] <dfcarney> j_oker2: Well, I'm guessing it's a config problem between your media center and the xbox.  The router won't block or NAT traffic internally, so unless your xbox or media center has some kind of firewall enabled, I'd start reading manuals.
[06:04] <nolimitsoya> Wooksta, either should be fine
[06:05] <Wooksta> nolimitsoya, ok thanks
[06:05] <Sorin> hello, dosr anyone know how to access windows partitions from Ubuntu desktop? I don't have the Disk tool under System Administration
[06:06] <kane77> I want to resize my windows partition (make it smaller)... is it safe? (will I lose my data) I want to use qtparted
[06:06] <tengil> how do i check what process keeps one of my harddrives busy
[06:06] <dfcarney> j_oker2: sorry that I can't be of much more help.  For a test you could try connecting your xbox directly to your media center (and setting up static IP addresses and routing tables) -- that will eliminate other sources of errors.
[06:06] <nolimitsoya> !ntfs | Sorin
[06:06] <ubotu> Sorin: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[06:06] <jpjacobs> Wooksta, depends on what you plan to use as desktop environment. if you want gnome use ubuntu-desktop, if you want kde used kubuntu-desktop if you want xfce use xubuntu-desktop, and if you want fluxbox install the server and install fluxbox later
[06:06] <birkett> hey, could someone help me out with ndiswrapper please?
[06:06] <Arwen> kane77, no it's not safe
[06:06] <Ace2016> bye all, thanks for your help
[06:06] <Arwen> kane77, you can do it with gparted or qtparted, but be sure to backup
[06:06] <dfcarney> tengil: 'lsof' will give you a list of all open/active file descriptors for processes
[06:07] <slacker> Sorin: you should be able to mount them pretty straightforward: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Windows
[06:07] <compengi> thanks dfcarney, jpjacobs :)
[06:07] <kane77> Arwen, but what? its 120GB disk... I can't back it up completely...
[06:07] <Arwen> kane77, err... you're kinda out of luck then
[06:07] <Arwen> kane77, you can try resizing, it may or may not succeed
[06:08] <ValMarko> Well , firestarter is running and is blocking a lot of stuff :)
[06:08] <kane77> Arwen, that's not what I was hoping for.. :D
[06:08] <birkett> ive got a winbond wireless card in my laptop, with the standard XP drivers copied to my linux partition, ive installed ndiswrapper, installed the drivers, ndiswrapper shows hardware as present for the driver, but i cant get the card to display in the network config panel
[06:08] <tengil> dfcarney: when trying to unmount /dev/hdc1 i get "device is busy". I tried lsof |grep hdc1 but got nothing, any other ideas?
[06:08] <Arwen> kane77, don't you have extra hard drives for backup? lol
[06:08] <kane77> no..
[06:08] <nolimitsoya> kane77, you realy should have a backup scheme either way. get one
[06:08] <starz> anyone else get high loads on just idling?
[06:08] <Arwen> kane77, but if you don't, just backup the files you need and reinstall with a Win* CD if it fails
[06:08] <slacker> tengil: fuser -c /dev/hdc1
[06:08] <dfcarney> tengil: what's hdc1 mounted as?
[06:08] <jpjacobs> tengil, sudo fuser -aikm /dev/hdc1
[06:08] <dfcarney> slacker: good call -- i forgot about fuser
[06:09] <slacker> dfcarney: first thing I use when I get a device is busy error
[06:09] <kane77> Arwen, its not a system disk, so thats not a problem
[06:09] <Arwen> is it possible to partition a CD-ROM?
[06:09] <jpjacobs> starz, can be... like when update-db runs. look at top to see what's hoggign cpu
[06:09] <Arwen> kane77, so, even if it's 120GB, how much of it is important data?
[06:09] <starz> jpjacobs, nothing much
[06:09] <birkett> ive got a winbond wireless card in my laptop, with the standard XP drivers copied to my linux partition, ive installed ndiswrapper, installed the drivers, ndiswrapper shows hardware as present for the driver, but i cant get the card to display in the network config panel
[06:09] <Arwen> 120GB is only around 30 DVDs, btw
[06:09] <starz> cpu is low load is high
[06:10] <kane77> Arwen, they are kind of important right now... (its dv video imported from a cam)
[06:10] <tengil> slacker: dfcarney jpjacobs fuser didnt show anything either. its mounted as /movies
[06:10] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, even less if you use dual layer dvd:s :)
[06:10] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, but in price, that's more expensive
[06:10] <benny> hello, is there a way to use fglrx without gdm, but with ratpoison ??
[06:10] <Arwen> kane77, seriously, get an external HD for backup purposes - is your win partition NTFS?
[06:11] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, it is, but might be worth it for a long term backup solution :)
[06:11] <jpjacobs> tengil, tried quitting everything that can be accessing it? like shells that are cd'd to that dir?
[06:11] <rausb0> birkett: are you sure you need to use the windows drivers for that card? which chipset is it?
[06:11] <kane77> no... its fat32
[06:11] <tengil> jpjacobs: yeah i tried that
[06:11] <Arwen> kane77, .... why didn't you say so???
[06:11] <Arwen> yea, you can resize it (I'd still recommend defrag+backup first)
[06:11] <Sorin> slacker: thanks, I will try do to the steps from that doc
[06:11] <bobbyc> hello, i'm looking for a c ide. what is the best program to use? i'm also looking for software to measure code complexity. any recommendations?
[06:11] <kane77> Arwen, does that change anything?
[06:11] <kane77> bobbyc, i think anjuta is good...
[06:12] <dfcarney> tengil: well, if fuser and lsof don't tell you then i'm stumped.  Maybe 'ps axuf' will show you.
[06:12] <slacker> tengil: if you are sure nothing is using that mountpoint: umount -l
[06:12] <Arwen> kane77, it does, lol - when you say windows partition, that usually means ntfs.....
[06:12] <birkett> rausb0: its not officially supported, and i dunno about the chipset, its a winbond w89c33 mPCI
[06:12] <kane77> Arwen, my fault...
[06:12] <jpjacobs> tengil, otherwise use sync && umount -l /movies
[06:13] <Arwen> kane77, try using an MS partition tool like Partition Magic instead of gparted, might be safer
[06:13] <kane77> Arwen, I believe I had one of those somewhere... I try to use it...
[06:14] <wenko> hey there can anyone tell me how to change the order of the grub boot loader
[06:15] <closett> hello all motherfuckers ;)
[06:15] <birkett> can anyone help me out on this one?
[06:15] <Arwen> wenko, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[06:15] <Arwen> !language > closett
[06:15] <wenko> thanks arwen
[06:15] <closett> iam an german boy arwen
[06:15] <slacker> LOL and that makes it ok?
[06:15] <Arwen> birkett, with?
[06:16] <closett> yes *g*
[06:16] <birkett> ive got a winbond wireless card in my laptop, with the standard XP drivers copied to my linux partition, ive installed ndiswrapper, installed the drivers, ndiswrapper shows hardware as present for the driver, but i cant get the card to display in the network config panel
[06:16] <kane77> Arwen, I was almost sure there would be no problem resizing partition... I used fdisk to partition my usb flash disk ... I deleted the partition and created new, and believeit or not  the data was there...

[06:17] <Arwen> tjb891, grow2fs I think
[06:17] <tjb891> kane77:i have gp-parted livecd
[06:17] <kane77> tjb891, there is a program gparted or qtparted....
[06:18] <slacker> Electro: could be.. I think the germans nowadays are not that eager to eliminate other humans
[06:18] <Leetlandon> Hey.
[06:18] <tjb891> but it does not let me make it bigger,only smaller
[06:18] <birkett> Arwen: any ideas?
[06:18] <Arwen> tjb891, use the resize2fs command
[06:18] <Arwen> birkett, for?
[06:18] <birkett> ive got a winbond wireless card in my laptop, with the standard XP drivers copied to my linux partition, ive installed ndiswrapper, installed the drivers, ndiswrapper shows hardware as present for the driver, but i cant get the card to display in the network config panel
[06:18] <Leetlandon> Does anyone know how far the counter goes up right when you start installing Ubuntu 6.10
[06:19] <tjb891> i might just renstall ubuntu, don't want to do that for a while though
[06:19] <tjb891> to much to burn to dvd and reload
[06:19] <Arwen> birkett, hrmm... say, is there a reason you can't use Ethernet instead? it's infinitely better than wifi
[06:19] <Arwen> tjb891, get another hard drive.............
[06:19] <birkett> i need portability
[06:19] <tjb891> i have 2
[06:19] <dromer> I have mounted a USB-drive with: sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/USB/  but where can I find it? it isn't in /media/
[06:19] <Arwen> tjb891, anyway, use the resize2fs command like I told you
=== ban_Wolfpaws is now known as Rambo3
[06:19] <slacker> Arwen: that's not a solution to a problem, try fixed instead of wireless
[06:20] <roadboy> hi all. i'm compiling some applications from source with apt-build install package but when the installer tries to install it dpkg gives the error: WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated! There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes. how can i fix it?
[06:20] <tjb891> wireless is cheaper now than ethernet

[06:20] <zeeed> how can I disable password confirming, when application want to use key from key manager database in gnome?
[06:20] <birkett> ya... just i cant get my wifi working :)
[06:20] <Leetlandon> Does anyone know how far the counter goes up right when you start installing Ubuntu 6.10
[06:20] <dromer> kitche: aah, should I mount it to /media then ?

[06:20] <Leetlandon> Pardon me?
[06:20] <dfcarney> dromer: if anything, mount it to a directory inside of /media.  Mounting it just to /media will hide everything already in that directory.
[06:21] <rausb0> birkett: complain to the card manufacturer about missing linux drivers. ndiswrapper is just a lame workaround, no real solution.
[06:21] <slacker> Arwen: if you don't have a solution, why make the comment at all?
[06:21] <kane77> Arwen, err... how shoud I go about doing that (resizing).. I think i need to unmount the disks I wanna work on... but I cannot unmount my ext2 partition ?

[06:21] <hassan> does anybody know of a good way to exctract some text information from an html file?
[06:21] <dfcarney> roadboy: ubotu is a bot :)
[06:21] <dromer> dfcarney: yes /media/USB then
[06:22] <Leetlandon> Arwen, how much is a noth?
[06:22] <Arwen> kane77, if you're running off that partition, you can't unmount it because it's system
[06:22] <dfcarney> dromer: should work, providing nothing else is mounted there
[06:22] <rausb0> Arwen: wireless may be not as reliable as ethernet, but without it i wouldn't have internet access right now
[06:22] <Arwen> Leetlandon, 1 notch = 1 of those weird rectangle thingies in the progress bar
[06:22] <Arwen> rausb0, ...what kinda place doesn't have ethernet jacks?
[06:22] <birkett> Zrock: the system finds the card fine... the drivers install through ndiswrapper fine, but the card just will not appear in the net panel
[06:22] <dfcarney> Arwen: internet cafes?
[06:22] <zeeed> can somebody help me with key manager in gnome?

[06:33] <nothlit> they are
[06:33] <Arwen> dromer, ?
[06:33] <dromer> hmm, I thought the .rm should be able to play ..
[06:33] <Arwen> slew, try the soundconverter package
[06:33] <rausb0> dromer: still .rm is a proprietary format
[06:34] <Zrock> <birkett> ya i see that now... they have changed the site since i DL it... they had a list of the 4 diffrent dist when i DL it and the i386 was under the alernat install methods.. i got the graphical install
[06:34] <Arwen> dromer, rm is a real media file, which 1. sucks and 2. is restricted
[06:34] <birkett> zrock: ive just got the ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[06:34] <rausb0> Arwen: agree
[06:34] <slew> Arwen, i'll give it a lookie loo
[06:34] <dromer> yeah well, the .asf doesn't play (yet ..)
[06:34] <Slart> Arwen: does the rm-format suck too? I thought it was only the player..
[06:35] <Arwen> dromer, asf is just a container - what codec is the audio/video in?
[06:35] <dromer> no idea
[06:35] <rausb0> Slart: it sucks because you need closed source codecs for it
[06:35] <sacater_> how do i install sound drivers for my motherboard
[06:35] <jenda> There is a quiz at 20:00 UTC tonight in #ubuntu-trivia! Be sure to attend, and if you're lucky, you might win a prime Ubuntu Poster! (Today's sponsor: rob)
[06:35] <Arwen> Slart, yea... Real Media sucks a lot, it's legacy compared to modern video and audio codecs
[06:35] <Zrock> <birkett> not sure now.... when i dl i got 4 diffrent versions
[06:36] <Slart> rausb0: how does "Real Alternative" make their player? using closed source codecs?
[06:36] <birkett> whats bugging me is that ndiswrapper -l reports the drive is installed and hardware is ppresent, iwlist and iwconfig only list my modem and ethernet

[06:36] <robdeman> hi all I installed Ubuntu 6.06 LTS but when I open SysInfo the 'System' reports Linux, 2.6.15.27-server, release: testing/unstable
[06:36] <robdeman> why is it 'unstable' ??
[06:36] <dfcarney> sacater_: do you have the source code for the driver?
[06:36] <Slart> rausb0: =).. it's an ..free (perhaps open source) real player for windows (and perhaps more)
[06:37] <sacater_> dfcarney: no
[06:37] <Arwen> robdeman, err... did you install a release candidate or other testing release? if not, just ignore the bug
[06:37] <dfcarney> sacater_: well, do you at least have the driver file (a .ko or a .o file)?
[06:37] <dromer> hmm, Arwen the .asf plays now ( this stream btw: mms://topstreams.omroep.nl/tv/ikon/dedonderdagdocumentaire/bb.20061213.asf)  but the fullscreen doesn't play propper
[06:37] <sacater_> dfcarney: its just my motherboard sound, and i need drivers for it
[06:37] <CharminTheMoose> hey all
[06:37] <rausb0> Slart: i doubt that it is open source. most "free" windows programs aren't
[06:37] <sacater_> dfcarney: i have no drivers
[06:37] <Arwen> dromer, what do you mean fullscreen doesn't play proper?
[06:37] <robdeman> Arwen: I downloaded and installed Ubuntu 6.06 LTS server for maximum stability>?
[06:37] <tur1> any one here is using or have use a webcam under ubuntu?
[06:37] <Arwen> dromer, also, I'm on dialup so I can't view that stream
[06:37] <illu45> hi
[06:37] <zdenek> has anyone an idea how to transfer file in ubuntu to a sony music player nw-S205F?
[06:38] <Arwen> robdeman, and it was the final release, correct? if it was, just ignore the "testing/unstable"
[06:38] <birkett> mount the player as a drive in /media
[06:38] <dromer> er, the sound and video don't play smooth .. hmm they 'burp' or h/e I can discribe it
[06:38] <neskato23> Hey, guys, I have a problem configuring my keyboard shortcuts, because the "media" button
[06:38] <CharminTheMoose> I'm having a serious problem with my dell wireless 1450,I need to get it working under wep,anyone know how to get it?
[06:38] <dfcarney> sacater_: first step is to figure out which driver you need -- you'll have to search on Google for that.  Then, see if it's been included in your system (look in /lib and on the Ubuntu website for details).  From there, you'll either need to use 'modprobe' to install it, or download the source code, build it, and install it.
[06:38] <dromer> Arwen: ok, too bad
[06:38] <CharminTheMoose> it works grand if there's no encryption
[06:38] <neskato23> opens me the Rythmbox and I would like to open amarok.
[06:38] <robdeman> Arwen: Its the one that ubuntu.com offeres from their main download page??
[06:38] <neskato23> (using GNOME)
[06:38] <Arwen> robdeman, yep - ignore the unstable/testing part, it's just another weird bug
[06:38] <viator> j #ubuntu-ot
[06:39] <Arwen> dromer, so, what was that about fullscreen?
[06:39] <sacater_> drcarney: isnt there something called gnome-alsa
[06:39] <zdenek> the mounting is done automatically but the data there seems very cryptic
[06:39] <rausb0> robdeman: testing/unstable is just what /etc/debian_release says. you can ignore that in ubuntu.
[06:39] <robdeman> Arwen: I got this one http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu//6.06/ -> Server install CD -> PC (Intel x86) server install CD
[06:39] <Slart> rausb0: hehe.. it was freeware only... and Real Media is upset with them about copyright issues http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Alternative
[06:39] <dfcarney> sacater_: maybe, but if you don't have a driver loaded then ALSA won't help you at all.

[06:42] <nothlit> sometimes people are busy, and the help is free
[06:42] <leachizzle> does anybody know how to start either the shoucast server or ice cast server i cant seem to find where but i know they are installed...Thanks
[06:42] <ubun> how do i remap keys in ubuntu?
[06:42] <viator> its ubuntu ot
[06:42] <Arwen> dromer, the video bitrate shows in the video details of various media players (not the default ubuntu one though)

[06:43] <ubotu> viator: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[06:43] <neskato23> Uh, I really would apreciate your help guys.
[06:43] <shiner421> a very easy question here: what is a good program for converting wma files to ogg format?
[06:43] <Arwen> shiner421, please don't try that, unless you're ears are so bad that crappy sound means nothing to you
[06:43] <shiner421> why?
[06:43] <gephalt> Anyone know of an application that can convert that goddamned .lit format? :(
[06:43] <viator> !offtopic
[06:43] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[06:43] <viator> ty
[06:44] <Arwen> shiner421, changing the codec (format) of a media file greatly reduces the quality
[06:44] <Arwen> unless you absolutely have to, don't
[06:44] <illu45> Could someone help me out with enabling hyperthreading?
[06:44] <tjb891> does anyone know if i can  with Gparted livecd i could make my ext3 partitian bigger by converting it to fat32,enlargin it, and converting it back to ext3?
[06:44] <shiner421> I absolutely have too
[06:44] <shiner421> for umm, reaons I cant get into here
[06:44] <Arwen> illu45, enabling it? just go to your bios, turn it on, and voila
[06:44] <Arwen> shiner421, soundconverter - you know you can install w32codecs?
[06:44] <dfcarney> shiner421: I think that mplayer can do it, but it's tricky.  Can't you convert them to .WAV files (in Windows) first?
[06:45] <leachizzle> how do i start any server in ubuntu.. whats the code for the terminal.. or its name so i can search online im on day 2 of linux..lol its been good
[06:45] <shiner421> I think I have w32codecs installed
[06:45] <nothlit> can anyone pastebin me the contents of /var/lib/dpkg/info/wireless-tools.list on edgy? I need it to fix dpkg
[06:45] <shiner421> possibly, but thats more work than I wanted to get into
[06:45] <dfcarney> leachizzle: to spawn a process, append "&" to the command
[06:45] <shiner421> I got 9 gb to convert
[06:45] <nothlit> !terminal | leachizzle
[06:45] <ubotu> leachizzle: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[06:45] <illu45> Arwen, I'm pretty sure that its enabled in BIOS, as my Windows boot recognizes it, but it doesn't seem to be recognized in Ubuntu :(
[06:45] <leachizzle> THANKS!
[06:45] <Arwen> shiner421, try converting to flac or wav or some other lossless codec... converting 9 GB will permanently crapify your audio and take ages
[06:45] <shiner421> ok
[06:46] <Arwen> illu45, if the system monitor shows 2 CPUs, it's on
[06:46] <shiner421> can I do it all in Linux?
[06:46] <Arwen> shiner421, yea, try the soundconverter package
[06:46] <nothlit> tjb891, you can directly enlarge your ext3 partition with gparted
[06:46] <Arwen> you'll need w32codecs though
[06:46] <shiner421> installing that now thanks :)
[06:46] <leachizzle> I LOVE UBUNTU
[06:46] <leachizzle> ..lol
[06:46] <leachizzle> thanks
[06:46] <illu45> Arwen, Right, I'm afraid it only shows one, though :(
[06:46] <dfcarney> shiner421: uh, maybe.  I found this article (though I don't know how much help it will be): http://ccux-linux.de/forums/showthread.php?p=19590
[06:46] <Arwen> shiner421, if that doesn't work, you can use mencoder or vlc to transcode (that's an even worse idea)
[06:47] <ArdieM> my soundcard is using the "mic, in, out"-jack as "front, rear, lfe" also.... is there a way to switch between this modes (alsa?)?
[06:47] <esaym> anyone know of a good program to see my desktop cpu temps?
[06:47] <illu45> Arwen, I've been looking at this HowTo, but no luck so far, maybe I'm doing something wrong? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=895077
[06:47] <ArdieM> esaym, sensors
[06:47] <ArdieM> lm-sensors
[06:47] <ArdieM> or smth like that :)
[06:48] <esaym> thats all?  sounds too simple :-/
[06:48] <neskato23> oh, c'mon... maybe all of you guys know how-to...
[06:48] <ArdieM> hm?
[06:48] <kekekeke> hi there
[06:48] <ldvx> hello =D, somebody knows how can i change the main menu icon?? i tried changing in /usr/share/icons/Human/48x48/places/star-here.png and then i restarted gnome-panel but it doesn't work... any ideas? :(
[06:48] <kekekeke> ubuntu is teh sux0r!!! debian is teh r0x0r!!! debian is 1337, ubuntu is for n000bz!!!!!!!
[06:48] <kekekeke> kekekeke+++
[06:48] <rausb0> esaym: or try cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/temperature
[06:49] <nothlit> ldvx, it can be in mutiple places, with multiple links and in multiple sizes
[06:49] <CharminTheMoose> kekekeke,stop trolling
[06:49] <graft> man, there's a non-starter
[06:49] <leachizzle> is there anyone here i can help me with shoutcast in general? if there is please Msg me..
[06:49] <kekekeke> why should i ?
[06:49] <graft> if you want to do it proper, try emacs vs. vim
[06:49] <dfcarney> kekekeke: Debian is also way out-of-date.  When did they last make a "stable" release that had relatively modern packages?
[06:49] <rausb0> kekekeke: so show us you are not a noob
[06:49] <shiner421> soundconverter doesnt seem to work, it says [file converted in 0s]  and there is no file afterwards, I am trying to convert from a NTFS partition, is that my problem?
[06:49] <CharminTheMoose> well,if you think that ubuntu sucks and is inferior to debian why shout it?
[06:49] <Administrateur_> hallo
[06:49] <neskato23> I just want to make my keyboard media button open amarok, notrythmbox
[06:49] <kekekeke> .LOL :D
[06:49] <PingunZ> kitche, it works now .. I just rebooted and .. tadam :)
[06:49] <jpjacobs> don't feed the trolls
[06:50] <Arwen> dfcarney, that's why there's the unstable release
[06:50] <kekekeke> CharminTheMoose: i only wanted to test if anyone feels offended by my bullshittalking
[06:50] <graft> unstable is not a release...
[06:50] <jpjacobs> just  /ignore them
[06:50] <neskato23> please dont ignore me
[06:50] <esaym> rausb0 thanks! that was what I was looking for!
[06:50] <dfcarney> Arwen: Which is fairly unstable...and ALWAYS the one that people use.
[06:50] <CharminTheMoose> i don't use ubuntu and i'm using debian but i'm not shout how much ubuntu sux
[06:50] <ldvx> nothlit, i tried by changing with every icon dealing with the main menu in ..../Human theme perhaps i'm missing something??
[06:50] <robdeman> hi folks what is a nice network / system infio viewer?
[06:50] <esaym> its shows in the logs like that
[06:50] <kekekeke> it's so funny when ppl get upset just because of some obvious trash talk
[06:50] <graft> um neskato23 there's some package to facilitate this, hode on
[06:50] <dfcarney> Arwen: i.e. what's the point in even having a "stable" release if it's 6-12 months behind the times?
[06:50] <Arwen> shiner421, ah wait... I think it uses gstreamer, that might be the issue..., are you trying to output to the ntfs partition? that would be a problem
[06:50] <robdeman> some gnome tool that hsows how much load there is on teh eth0, waybe webserver etc
[06:50] <kekekeke> CharminTheMoose: it has NOTHING to do with operating systems... only with provoking ppl
[06:50] <kekekeke> well yeah
[06:50] <kekekeke> ut worked
[06:50] <shiner421> no only read from the ntfs partition
[06:50] <kekekeke> so i can sleep well now
[06:50] <Arwen> dfcarney, have you seen ubuntu? it's 6-24 months behind the times
[06:50] <kekekeke> cya
[06:50] <nothlit> kekekeke, this channel is not the place for that.
[06:51] <shiner421> however I jstu copied the files to my desktop

[06:51] <Arwen> shiner421, hmm, I guess you'll have to do it the hard way... btw, use mplayer
[06:51] <dfcarney> Arwen: I find it better managed than Debian.  Not that I don't like Debian -- I use Debian at home, and Ubuntu at work. :)

[06:52] <nothlit> !firestarter | emilia
[06:52] <ubotu> emilia: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

[06:54] <dfcarney> blue: it's possible, though some of the unstable apps may depend on unstable libraries which, in turn, will break otherwise stable apps

[07:00] <slayer03> i dont have this utility graft
[07:00] <slayer03> i tried it : command not found
[07:00] <slacktyro> do i need to download some especial lib to be able to burn dvds?
[07:01] <shiner421> errors I keep getting are unresolved dependencies thatsays cannot install
[07:01] <CharminTheMoose> how well does ndiswrapper cope with wep encryption?
[07:01] <illu45> Could someone help me out with enabling hyper-threading on Edgy?
[07:01] <jrib> walter: applicatiosn > sound and video > sound juicer
[07:01] <graft> slayer03: install it, it's in the repos
[07:01] <kitche> shiner421: do you have all the repos enabled?
[07:01] <shiner421> I think so
[07:01] <nothlit> jrib, hmm, would you know how to force the existing file's removal?
[07:01] <shiner421> I see multiverse and universe a lot
[07:01] <jrib> walter: I thought you meant extract the tracks, did you mean actually copying a cd to another cd?
[07:02] <jrib> nothlit: no
[07:02] <walter> YES
[07:02] <nouri> hmm, when i unplug my network cable, "route" needs quite some time to determine the gateway
[07:02] <rausb0> nouri: try route -n instead
[07:02] <jrib> walter: have you tried gnomebacker, graveman, or k3b?
[07:02] <jrib> walter: gnomebaker*
[07:02] <nothlit> shiner421, yeah you shouldn't have both dapper and breezy listed
[07:02] <NewRhyme> Hey all! :-)
[07:02] <Hoag> Hey all. Does anyone know if it's possible to set a wmctrl command to apply BEFORE an app is opened, so you don't have to run it every time?
[07:03] <slacktyro> do i need to download some especial lib to be able to burn dvds?
[07:03] <kitche> nouri: you should also down the device before you take the cable out it will be faster instead of waiting for route
[07:03] <shiner421> ok where is an example list for an edgy sources.list?
[07:03] <walter> i need something easy .. this linux is for very beginer user
[07:03] <shiner421> messed mine all up hehe
[07:03] <PingunZ> Do I need klibc when i use gnome ?

[07:03] <shiner421> so we have identified my problem
[07:03] <NewRhyme> Can someone help me with a simple "compiling " problem(S)?
[07:04] <kitche> shiner421: umm just comment the lines for dapper and breezy
[07:04] <nothlit> shiner421, yes, its severely broken lol
[07:04] <neskato23> i just want to open amarok with as my favorite music player in gnome instead of rythmbox when i press the keybinding
[07:04] <shiner421> no wonder beryl kept screwing up my x windows server
[07:04] <nothlit> shiner421, your system is still a breezy system
[07:04] <jrib> shiner421: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37380/ maybe add your beryl repo too
[07:04] <jrib> shiner421: wait, are you not using edgy?
[07:04] <NewRhyme> I need to install "make" ...for some reason, when I installed the "DAppper"  64-bit version, it left that out...
[07:04] <graft> neskato23: wanna post your hotkeys.conf?
[07:05] <nothlit> shiner421, wait. wow. your sources.list is really scattered
[07:05] <nothlit> shiner421, did you update properly from breezy to edgy to dapper?
[07:05] <shiner421> ok I copied jribs sources.list into mine
[07:05] <jrib> NewRhyme: install build-essential
[07:05] <shiner421> no I did a straight install for 6.10
[07:05] <jrib> shiner421: are you actually using edgy?
[07:05] <frogzoo> NewRhyme: build-essential
[07:05] <shiner421> yes
[07:05] <shiner421> if thats 6.10
[07:05] <nothlit> shiner421, did you use source-o-matic?
[07:05] <NewRhyme> I have tried that...jrib....but, to NO avail...it is NOT on my install disk,...
[07:05] <shiner421> ahh whats that?
[07:06] <jrib> shiner421: yes, now  sudo apt-get update
[07:06] <frogzoo> NewRhyme: ht is enabled by default
[07:06] <NewRhyme> at least , MAKE is NOT on it
[07:06] <slayer03> /dev/hdd2            1881        4092     1114471    f  W95 Erw. (LBA)
[07:06] <slayer03> how can i mount this partition please
[07:06] <shiner421> gives me an error on line 1
[07:06] <jrib> NewRhyme: it should be, do you not have internet access?
[07:06] <nothlit> !fstab | slayer03
[07:06] <ubotu> slayer03: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[07:06] <shiner421> oh wait I know
[07:06] <rausb0> slayer03: an extended partition cannot be mounted. its just a container for logical partitions.
[07:06] <nothlit> slayer03, , you'll need to know the filesystem
[07:06] <jrib> shiner421: did you get rid of the line numbers?
[07:06] <NewRhyme> Yes...I do...but, still NOT installing MAKE because of some error message
[07:07] <neskato23> where is hotkeys.conf ?
[07:07] <jrib> NewRhyme: want to tell us the error message?
[07:07] <shiner421> sweet working
[07:07] <slayer03> ok
[07:07] <nothlit> !fat > slayer03
[07:07] <shiner421> I wonder if beryl will not crash my system now
[07:07] <nothlit> !ntfs-3g > slayer03
[07:07] <rausb0> slayer03: hdd2 surely contains at least hdd5, maybe hdd6, ...
[07:07] <NewRhyme> hold on...let me get it, and, cut and paste...brb
[07:07] <nouri> kitche: Taking down the device helped!
[07:07] <knight17> clear
[07:07] <tjb891> I have a .iso in my home folder, to mount it i would use sudo mount (filename) -o -loop correct?
[07:08] <blue> i have another question. im using ubuntu on my ppc laptop. when it boots up, there are pink/purple artifacts all over my screen, switching to a vt and back to x fixes the problem. anyone know how to fix the artificats on boot issue?
[07:08] <graft> tjb891: no - before loop
[07:08] <nouri> kitche: Is there a way to do this automatically when the network is down?
[07:08] <nothlit> shiner421, who helped you edit your sources.list?
[07:08] <tjb891> ok
[07:08] <jrib> tjb891: you need a mount point
[07:08] <shiner421> hehe look at that VLC now installs
[07:08] <nothlit> tjb891, you need to specify the filesystem... its iso96 something
[07:08] <shiner421> no one
[07:08] <shiner421> I played with it myself :)
[07:08] <kitche> nouri: there's a script that you might be able to find I know Fedora Core has something like that I haven't done it myself
[07:08] <shiner421> as you can see I know nothing about it
[07:09] <nothlit> shiner421, only keep one distro/version in the list
[07:09] <shiner421> k
[07:09] <tjb891> i just have a .iso in my home folder, i really have no idea how to use the mount command
[07:09] <nouri> kitche: What is it looking for again that takes so long?
[07:09] <jrib> shiner421: oh by the way, those were canadian mirrors, so if you don't live near canada you may want to change that
[07:09] <knight17> how can I install KDE in ubuntu?
[07:09] <shiner421> I do actually
[07:09] <graft> not that it should matter - old distros should just be superceded by new ones anyway
[07:09] <illu45> Could someone please help me out with enabling hyperthreading on a 32-bit install of Edgy?
[07:09] <shiner421> I live in Seattle
[07:09] <jrib> !kde | knight17
[07:09] <ubotu> knight17: KDE (http://kde.org) is the K Desktop Environment. To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop", or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE for other ways to get KDE
[07:09] <kitche> nouri: it still thinks the interface is still up most likely
[07:09] <frogzoo> which is better: initNG - vs - runit   ?
[07:09] <nothlit> tjb891, http://linuxreviews.org/howtos/cdrecording/
[07:10] <tjb891> thankyou
[07:10] <loz> i have done this with kde, but i would stick to gnome if i was you
[07:10] <loz> especially if you want to use xgl
[07:10] <shiner421> ok cool vlc appears to be playing the file but I have no sound
[07:11] <loz> anyone know anything about peer tv, and how to install on edgy?
[07:11] <shiner421> sound worked yesterday
[07:12] <sp0iler> my titlebars and the "window decoration" do not show when I run beryl (on Edgy). rest of the effects are visible. I'm using svn20061215 version of beryl and emerald
[07:12] <sp0iler> :(
[07:12] <shiner421> is it stable?
[07:12] <shiner421> for me beryl was not stable
[07:12] <nothlit> !beryl
[07:12] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[07:13] <shiner421> kept causing complete system hangs
[07:13] <shiner421> ctrl-alt-backspace wouldnt work
[07:13] <nothlit> beryl is pretty stable once you get it working
[07:13] <shiner421> but I had a very messed up sources list
[07:13] <shiner421> then its just me
[07:13] <shiner421> ok just downloaded 33 updates, gonna have to reboot
[07:13] <frogzoo> which is better: initNG - vs - runit   ?
[07:13] <shiner421> ill be back, if not shortly, then longly :)
[07:14] <shiner421> this is becoming my favorite electronic hangout heeh
[07:14] <Wooksta> how do i install mysql / apache / php for ubuntu desktop? ive gone to add remove applications but they arent in the list..
[07:14] <nothlit> shiner421, wait, you stuck the breezy cd inside and tried to install stuff from it?
[07:14] <nothlit> !lamp | Wooksta
[07:14] <ubotu> Wooksta: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[07:14] <NewRhyme> back
[07:14] <NewRhyme> Now it can't even find the INSTALL pkg!!!!
[07:14] <NewRhyme> install: missing destination file operand after `build-essential'
[07:14] <shiner421> no
[07:15] <shiner421> I forget is 6.10 breezy?
[07:15] <jrib> NewRhyme: the command is 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
[07:15] <NewRhyme> No...will try sudo
[07:15] <jrib> shiner421: no, 6.10 is edgy
[07:15] <jrib> NewRhyme: the apt-get part is important
[07:15] <shiner421> ok then no edgy is all I have
[07:15] <shiner421> finally my kernel images are getting correctly installed!
[07:15] <nothlit> NewRhyme, its you know ` is different than '
[07:16] <shiner421> ok rebooting, be back soon
[07:16] <nothlit> shiner421, you have this line #deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386 (20051012)] / breezy main restricted
[07:16] <loz> could anyone guide me on ssh, anyone one no about the no ip adress, with zapato.org?
[07:17] <SuperLag> How do you uninstall package+package_deps?
[07:17] <SuperLag> does apt-get remove handle the deps?
[07:17] <vanberge> obviously the opinion of #ubuntu will be biased, but... what is the best distro to run on a laptop?  (i run ubuntu on my desktop, am getting a new laptop...  and like to try new things.)  :-)
[07:18] <kitche> SuperLag: apt-get doesn't handle deps aptitude does though but you need to use it to install packages also
[07:18] <jrib> SuperLag: no, either use aptitude to install and remove or try apt-get autoremove
[07:19] <loz> depends what process you got, centrinos are great with ubuntu
[07:19] <NewRhyme> Hey...it worked!!!!!
[07:19] <SuperLag> for laptops, I like Gentoo or Ubuntu... but I'm biased :)
[07:19] <jrib> !synaptic | NewRhyme
[07:19] <ubotu> NewRhyme: synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[07:19] <vanberge> loz: yeah, i love ubuntu so i'll probably end up with it.  :-)
[07:19] <jrib> !apt | NewRhyme
[07:19] <ubotu> NewRhyme: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[07:19] <nothlit> SuperLag, apt-get autoremove, but I've heard it doesn't work so well
[07:20] <SuperLag> nothlit: oh? do tell
[07:20] <NewRhyme> I was using the "apt-get install XXXX...XXXX", in SU.. (NOT SUDO)
[07:20] <knight17> While installing themes it is saying that it is not the correct format.Why?
[07:20] <ValMarko> hi. How can I make firestarter run each time the system boots?
[07:20] <NewRhyme> seems to make a differencce!
[07:20] <mdk1> hi there. Just trying Feisty, looks ok. One thing I'd like to solve as a matter of urgency - I can't use ssh as a client. Any ideas?
[07:20] <jrib> NewRhyme: take a look at the FAQ linked in the topic
[07:20] <knight17> any1 have any ideas??
[07:20] <loz> vanberge, i run edgy on my toshiba laptop, it works fine, even beryl i ve got the centrino duo, even wireless works with no messing about
[07:20] <kitche> mdk1: ask in #ubuntu+1 that is for Ubuntu development version
[07:21] <mdk1> kitche: I did, without a reply.

[07:21] <slacktyro> which packages should i install to burn a dvd?
[07:21] <NewRhyme> okay...but, would there be ANY reason that SU would make any difference, compared with SUDO and the <root> command?
[07:21] <mdk1> jenda: outrageous
[07:21] <jenda> 
[07:21] <vanberge> loz: cool... thx.   Beryl rules!  im running on my desktop.  what ver. you on?

[07:22] <M3G4crux> hi
[07:22] <knight17> SO...no one has a solution..ok I am leaving..thanks
[07:22] <M3G4crux> I am having a problem trying to uninstall a package
[07:22] <jrib> knight17: what theme?
[07:22] <slayer03> vanberge, yes
[07:22] <jenda> Hmm... I might have a question for you folks, though... copied my entire / partition to another one... what all do I need to change for it to work right?
[07:23] <NewRhyme> just as a ROOT user...for example...to get to SYNAPTIC dpkg manager...I use "su synaptic"
[07:23] <walter> ok. installed gnomebaker, can not find doc on how to copy music CD to another CD .. any info ?
[07:23] <loz> vanberge: i m on edgy, ubuntu 6.10, the 3 d is amazing, always nice to show are windows friemds!!
[07:23] <jrib> M3G4crux: what package? what problem?
[07:23] <M3G4crux> I have tried to force it with dpkg --force-all -r but still it does not let me. Package is python-httplib2 and I got it from opensync
[07:23] <slacktyro> my k3b is giving problem at module k3bsetup2
[07:23] <jrib> NewRhyme: try to use my name or what you say might get lost in the scrollback.  You aren't using su correctly
[07:23] <slacktyro> how can i fix it?
[07:23] <ryanakca> anybody know of a maintained app simmilar to colorlogs? http://www.resentment.org/projects/colorlogs/index.html   it doesn't seem to color the text...
[07:23] <vanberge> loz: same..   :-)
[07:23] <loz> vanberge: i m on edgy, ubuntu 6.10, the 3d is amazing, always nice to show are windows friends the true power of linux11
[07:24] <M3G4crux> it gives me some output, I have commented out the repositories for opensync and tried to fix it by replacing it with the older version but it seems apt-get won't advance while that package is there
[07:24] <NewRhyme> jrib...okay
[07:24] <M3G4crux> is there another way to force this package to uninstall?
[07:24] <karim> is there a stream server or something like that for music ? I have my music on a pc on the lan, and want to listen it on another computer
[07:24] <nothlit> jenda, grub, fstab
[07:24] <jrib> NewRhyme: su foo  means switch to user foo
[07:24] <vanberge> M3G4crux: did you try to remove from synaptic?
[07:25] <M3G4crux> actually not
[07:25] <M3G4crux> I am going to check that
[07:25] <vanberge> M3G4crux: worht a shot... :-/
[07:25] <jenda> nothlit: cool, thx
[07:25] <nothlit> !uuid > jenda
[07:25] <slacktyro> my k3b is giving problem at module k3bsetup2, how can i fix that?
[07:26] <M3G4crux> it says same thing as apt-get, ERROR please inform, etc.
[07:26] <rapid> slacktyro, install it properly
[07:26] <jrib> knight17: what theme?  Do you have a link to it?
[07:26] <shiner421> ok odd I went to the web and found how to install beryl on edgy, but in the spot where it says to add the repos to my sources.list, it shows the link but has a funny double arrow thingy on it, what is that?
[07:26] <vanberge> slacktyro: k3b is a kde app i think, right?  if nobody here knows, you could probably try #kde-users ?  somebody might know there.  sorry i dont hav emuch exp. with k3b
[07:26] <slacktyro> rapid i installed it using apt-get
[07:26] <jrib> M3G4crux: put your error output from apt-get on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give us the url
[07:26] <shiner421> and usingg a terminal window it says that beryl itself is not a package I can install

[07:30] <NewRhyme> laterz for now...
[07:30] <shiner421> I dont know how to add it using synaptic
[07:30] <Eclypse> whoa
[07:30] <kitche> wimpies: have you done an upgrade lately?
[07:30] <Eclypse> new version of gdm?
[07:30] <Eclypse> :S
[07:30] <wimpies> yes i have
[07:30] <shiner421> using the software sources link?
[07:31] <vanberge> shiner421: yep
[07:31] <SpiX^> can i use Xchat then ?
[07:31] <slacktyro> i installed k3b through apt-get, it's giving problem at module k3bsetup2
[07:31] <slacktyro> how can i fix that?
[07:31] <wimpies> kitche : and it was after the reboot sound no longer worked.  But AFAIK I run only one kernel version and hence do not know where that upgrade might come from
[07:31] <vanberge> shiner421: settings > repositories
[07:31] <eegore> is there a particular reason I cannot control the volume of the individual applications. Anyone have an idea what is causing that
[07:31] <kitche> wimpies: well that's your problem the kerbnel was probably upgraded and the modules didn't get upgraded as well
[07:31] <M3G4crux> ok I have pasted it to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37407/
[07:31] <vanberge> shiner421: then click on 'third party'
[07:32] <shiner421> yea its not working
[07:32] <shiner421> and now I have screwed up synaptic again :(
[07:32] <nevron> has anyone managed to run beryl dual head with fglrx drivers?
[07:32] <wimpies> kitche : probably but afaik all linux modules seem to be ad 2.6.17-10 which match my kernel.  What packages should I check ?
[07:32] <vanberge> shiner421: how?  is it crashing?
[07:32] <shiner421> not crashing, but said errors in my sources list after doing that
[07:32] <Eclypse> umm
[07:32] <Eclypse> anyone there?
[07:32] <Eclypse> lol
[07:32] <vanberge> shiner421: are you on normal i386 edgy
[07:33] <shiner421> and wouldnt load any packages
[07:33] <jrib> knight17: what theme?  Do you have a link to it?
[07:33] <M3G4crux> jrib, and when I try to install it I get http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37408/
[07:33] <shiner421> yea
[07:33] <kitche> wimpies: see what /lib/modules say in there
[07:33] <Eclypse> doesn't seem like anyone is paying attention to me.
[07:33] <shiner421> dont know why but the repo link in the wiki for beryl is no good
[07:33] <Eclypse> lol
[07:33] <vanberge> shiner421: hold on just a sec.
[07:33] <jrib> M3G4crux: it's a bug in the package.  What do you need this for?
[07:33] <shiner421> quadruple checking my typing
[07:33] <wimpies> 2.6.16-10-386 and 2.6.17-10-generic.
[07:34] <belfegor> my xchat didnt connect on undernet...why?
[07:34] <wimpies> However I have some 'restricted' modules that seem stil on 2.6.17-6-1
[07:34] <M3G4crux> for multisync, the version that is supposed to work with Nokia 6280
[07:34] <MUTU> belfegor: does it connect to other servers?
[07:34] <M3G4crux> however I just mean to uninstall it
[07:34] <belfegor> yes
[07:34] <vanberge> Eclypse: if you need help, just ask... :-)  people dont say hello because it'll flood te screen
[07:34] <M3G4crux> and as you see it just does not want to :D
[07:34] <shiner421> ok removed all beryl references in my sources list
[07:34] <MUTU> belfegor: what undernet server did you try and connect to?
[07:34] <vanberge> shiner421: now try to add using synaptic
[07:35] <knight17> @jrib I tried to install a theme from art.gnome.org
[07:35] <kitche> wimpies: ok it seems like you are using 2.6.16-10 modules still for some reason
[07:35] <belfegor> Connecting to eu.undernet.org (193.109.122.67) port 6667...
[07:35] <Eclypse> vanberge I did ask for help . . .
[07:35] <shiner421> doing that
[07:35] <belfegor> and it doesnt connect
[07:35] <shiner421> and got a public key error
[07:35] <vanberge> shiner421: thats good
[07:35] <shiner421> says no public key available
[07:35] <jrib> knight17: link me to it, so I can try it.  It usually means it was improperly formatted by the uploaded (but you can still install it)
[07:35] <vanberge> shiner421: you need to import it
[07:35] <shiner421> ok
[07:35] <Eclypse> vanberge I was asking if anyone knew of a good guide for setting up beryl with xgl and an ATI card on edgy . . . . the one I tired on ubuntu guide didn't work, perhaps I just need to troubleshoot it or something . . .
[07:35] <Curio> ho
[07:35] <Curio> hi
[07:35] <MUTU> belfegor: try irc.undernet.org
[07:35] <Curio> i v got a problem
[07:35] <wimpies> kitche : which packages should I reinstall ?
[07:35] <reverseblade> !hi | Curio
[07:35] <ubotu> Curio: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[07:36] <M3G4crux> jrib, do you know any way to force it to uninstall?
[07:36] <shiner421> uh oh now my software sources box jsut stoped responding
[07:36] <belfegor> looking up irc.undernet.org it  appear
[07:36] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  hi
[07:36] <ValMarko> Is there a way to make firestarter run automatikly each time I boot the system?
[07:36] <knight17> @ jrib but I was able to install it via the DOS prompt
[07:36] <vanberge> Eclypse: for beryl/xgl you should probably try #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl.  might find more help there
[07:36] <knight17> err terminal
[07:36] <reverseblade> ValMarko, yes, it is service
[07:36] <Curio> well my problem is that i cant install ubuntu
[07:36] <jrib> M3G4crux: pastebin the output from this command: grep -A 100 python-httplib2 /var/lib/dpkg/status
[07:36] <ValMarko> service?
[07:37] <Curio> i dont know why
[07:37] <reverseblade> Curio , specifically ?
[07:37] <kitche> wimpies: reinstall the kernel package
[07:37] <wimpies> kitche : I really don't get it ... there are NO updates available if I run upgrade but still I have wrong versions ?
[07:37] <elfreakz> is there any easy way to install XGL on my ubuntu edgy?
[07:37] <Music_Shuffle> Curio, you...will need to be more specific. Lol.
[07:37] <reverseblade> Curio, at what stage you have a problem
[07:37] <wimpies> kitche : which is ?
[07:37] <reverseblade> elfreakz, forget about XGL, go for AIGLX
[07:37] <vanberge> shiner421: go here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy
[07:37] <Eclypse> vanberge, I'll be back here if everypone there is afk.
[07:37] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  well i ve donwload ubuntu and i burned in a cd
[07:37] <reverseblade> elfreakz, it is default enabled
[07:37] <Curio> *on
[07:37] <elfreakz> reverseblade, mandriva is using xgl right?
[07:37] <reverseblade> Curio, and ?
[07:37] <jrib> knight17: it's not a DOS prompt, it's a bash prompt probably.  So everything is working for you now?
[07:38] <elfreakz> reverseblade, i want to make ubuntu looks like mandriva, i suspected mandriva using xgl?
[07:38] <shiner421> I might have the key import working
[07:38] <kitche> wimpies: kerbnel-image-2.6.X.X
[07:38] <reverseblade> elfreakz, dunno, but as I said, forget about XGL, edgy has AIGLX built in which is better
[07:38] <shiner421> nope
[07:38] <Curio> and i restarted my computer and changed the boot of my computer
[07:38] <elfreakz> reverseblade, AIGLX is build in?
[07:38] <slacktyro> how can i use kde instead gnome?
[07:38] <reverseblade> elfreakz, it uses either XGL or AIGLX, dunno which one. just install beryl
[07:38] <kitche> wimpies: the X.X is just for numbers sicne I m not sure what kernel-image is in the repos
[07:38] <belfegor> xchat will close now ..report a bug
[07:38] <Curio> but the ubuntu doesnt start
[07:38] <reverseblade> elfreakz, yes only in edgy+
[07:38] <Capslock118> (13:36:25) Capslock118: ok so i was told mentioned that because I have ubuntu edgy 64bit, I would need to make sure I have xlibs32 and its dependencies installed (to get cedega to run properly)....
[07:38] <Capslock118>  how can i check that?
[07:38] <Capslock118>  i searched the repositories for xlibs but nothing really comes up but xlibx-dev -data and -static-dev
[07:38] <wimpies> kitche : you mean linux-image ?
[07:38] <M3G4crux> jrib, there we go http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37410/
[07:38] <kitche> wimpies: yes
[07:38] <reverseblade> Curio, what happens installation halts ?
[07:38] <elfreakz> reverseblade, how do i install beryl without terminal..
[07:39] <vanberge> shiner421: see the line on there about importing the key?  its not formatted very well because it looks like its under the ATI section, but you do have to do it regardless
[07:39] <reverseblade> !beryl | elfreakz
[07:39] <ubotu> elfreakz: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[07:39] <wimpies> ok doing that now ...
[07:39] <Qais> hi every one, I'm new in linux at all. But WOW
[07:39] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  doesnt start
[07:39] <schmirgo> does anyone have a wacom tablet working? wacdump does show the right tablet and Xorg seems to access the tablet but when i move the pen the cursor does not move :/
[07:39] <shiner421> that guide still doesnt work for me
[07:39] <shiner421> cannot add the key
[07:39] <reverseblade> elfreakz, just go to wiki.ubuntu.com, and search for beryl
[07:39] <elfreakz> thanks
[07:39] <ryanakca> anybody know of a maintained app simmilar to colorlogs? http://www.resentment.org/projects/colorlogs/index.html   it doesn't seem to color the text...
[07:39] <shiner421> wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/root@lupine.me.uk.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add - is the error I get
[07:39] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  seems like the cd was empty but i check the cd and ubuntu is there
[07:39] <reverseblade> Curio, what is your computer , hp paviliion ?
[07:39] <slacktyro> to change gnome to kde, what do i need to do?
[07:39] <vanberge> shiner421: you did this command?  wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/root@lupine.me.uk.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[07:39] <Capslock118> no one?
[07:39] <LjL> Ubotu, tell slacktyro about kde | slacktyro, see the private message from Ubotu
[07:40] <unikon> hp's are great with linux
[07:40] <reverseblade> no
[07:40] <reverseblade> HP Pavilion sucks with linux
[07:40] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  nop fujitsu siemens
[07:40] <shiner421> if I change the -0- to a -o- I get a permission denied error
[07:40] <shiner421> yea that command dont work
[07:40] <reverseblade> Curio, processor ?
[07:40] <reverseblade> Curio, does it halt ?
[07:40] <slacktyro> thank you LjL
[07:40] <vanberge> shiner421: break it up into 2... do this one first wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/root@lupine.me.uk.gpg -O-
[07:40] <reverseblade> Curio, what error message do you get? or only a black screen ?
[07:41] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  black screem
[07:41] <shiner421> is that the letter o or the number zero?
[07:41] <vanberge> shiner421: then do this command second:  sudo apt-key add -
[07:41] <tom__> ok, so i accidentally just used gparted to format my ubuntu partition to fat32 from ext 3 so it can not boot, is there a way i can undue this or at least recover the date
[07:41] <LjL> slacktyro: if you later want to remove gnome (which is non-trivial theoretically), i suggest you remove the libgnome2.0-0 package - that should take care of most of it
[07:41] <vanberge> shiner421: just copy and paste it.  :-)
[07:41] <lakin> I'm on an AMD Athlon 1600 XP ... which kernel should I be running -386 or -generic? (Edgy)
[07:41] <shiner421> it wont copy and paste, just tried that
[07:41] <M3G4crux> jrib, I dont know if you read my message :) I will suppose you did, thanks for your help, I really appreciate
[07:41] <LjL> lakin: generic
[07:41] <reverseblade> I can solve black screen , but black screem, I dunno
[07:41] <jpjacobs> tom__, try gpart...
[07:41] <reverseblade> lakin, 386, try #kernel
[07:42] <LjL> 386?
[07:42] <tom__> jpjacobs:thats what i used to accidentally destroy it
[07:42] <lakin> reverseblade: why #kernel !??  it's an ubuntu specific question.
[07:42] <jrib> M3G4crux: ok, /var/lib/dpkg/info/python-httplib2.prerm pastebin that
[07:42] <tom__> if i format back again will it bring all the data back
[07:42] <jpjacobs> but if it's possible, copy over the whole disk to a backup first, and work on thta image
[07:42] <LjL> !generic
[07:42] <ubotu> Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[07:42] <reverseblade> lakin, no it is linux specific question
[07:42] <shiner421> ok did it in two pieces, waiting for my terminal to come back
[07:42] <jpjacobs> tom__, not gpartd, gpart
[07:42] <Curio> i mean installation doesnt start.
[07:42] <nevron> ok people this is the second time i am asking it has anyone managed to run beryl dual head with fglrx drivers?
[07:42] <tom__> jpjacobs:what does gpart do
[07:42] <reverseblade> LjL, I consider generic kernels a little problematic
[07:42] <lakin> reverseblade: no ... it's an ubuntu specific question ... which of the _Ubuntu_ kernel packages should I be using ..
[07:42] <vanberge> shiner421: 'come back'?  did it close?
[07:42] <shiner421> hmm it froze my terminal
[07:42] <Curio> does the problem
[07:42] <reverseblade> lakin, ok sorry, ignore me
[07:43] <Music_Shuffle> !generic | lakin
[07:43] <ubotu> lakin: Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[07:43] <shiner421> cant explain
[07:43] <shiner421> but its froze
[07:43] <shiner421> GRRR
[07:43] <lakin> Thanks Music_Shuffle, LjL
[07:43] <Music_Shuffle> Best of luck.
[07:43] <jpjacobs> tom__, it guesses lost partitions. or you can try testdisk
[07:43] <LjL> reverseblade: lakin is right... he could *possibly* find some help in #kernel too, i suppose, but his question was fine for this channel
[07:43] <reverseblade> Curio, when opening, push F6,  and add noapic to the end of booting line
[07:43] <vanberge> shiner421: at which command?
[07:43] <tom__> ok
[07:43] <M3G4crux> ok jrib
[07:43] <reverseblade> LjL, ok I was wrong
[07:43] <jpjacobs> tom__, but if it's even remotely possible, use dd to copy over the whole partition/HD to some safe place
[07:43] <shiner421> the second one
[07:44] <shiner421> it just drops the cursor
[07:44] <shiner421> and then nothing happens
[07:44] <nevron> has anyone managed to run beryl dual head with fglrx drivers?
[07:44] <lakin> As an interesting side note ... sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image...-generic doesn't put in the grub menu.lst entries ...
[07:44] <vanberge> shiner421: it takes a bit
[07:44] <tom__> yes it possible
[07:44] <shiner421> ahh
[07:44] <vanberge> mine did that too
[07:44] <oobee> I have installed a package but can't work out how to make it appear on the menu? can anyone help?
[07:44] <shiner421> grabbing a drink then brb
[07:44] <vanberge> brb
[07:44] <Curio> you mean i restart my computer and i try to install ubuntu again
[07:44] <M3G4crux> jrib here it is: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37413/
[07:44] <tom__> jpjabobs:does the ubuntu 6.06 isntall cd have gpart on it
[07:44] <Curio> if problem is there again i push f6
[07:44] <vanberge> oobee: what app?  some times apps dont put icons in the menus
[07:45] <reverseblade> Curio, hmm could you install it ? Live CD boots ?
[07:45] <Curio> and i change the las booting line for noapic
[07:45] <thorns> I need some help figuring out why ubuntu won't do NAT
[07:45] <shiner421> ok its still not responding
[07:45] <lakin> For that matter, neither of them do!?!
[07:45] <LjL> lakin: actually, just *installing* it would usually put the entry in the grub menu, here
[07:45] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  no icant install
[07:45] <oobee> vanberge: ekiga
[07:45] <reverseblade> Curio, that may work, this is the only reason I see linux kernels not booting on some lappies
[07:45] <thorns> I've got the simplest iptables rule and it won't forward packets, all policies are set to ACCEPT
[07:45] <lakin> LjL: I just installed it, and it didn't put it.
[07:45] <nevron> has anyone managed to run beryl dual head with fglrx drivers?
[07:45] <reverseblade> Curio,  can you boot into live CD ?
[07:46] <godtvisken> I am getting a high pitched noise when recording with audacity, but testing with dd the pitch is not there. What's wrong? I can't check the version number because when I do About Audacity, the characters are just blocks.
[07:46] <jpjacobs> tom__, i don't know
[07:46] <l3mr> lakin: use update-grub
[07:46] <oobee> vanberge: Is there must be a gnome menu editor?
[07:46] <Curio> [[[reverseblade] ] ]  yep
[07:46] <shiner421> still not responding
[07:46] <lakin> lakin@area17:~$ sudo update-grub sudo: update-grub: command not found
[07:46] <jpjacobs> i know it's on grml for sure :)
[07:46] <lakin> l3mr: update-grub isn't installed ?
[07:46] <nvicf> hello there, how can I upgrade from breezy to dapper but having the server version?I don't have graphical interface, should I do that via sources.list like I've read somewhere?
[07:46] <reverseblade> Curio, if you can boot into the Live CD , instllation should have worked

[07:46] <jrib> M3G4crux: ok, here's the problem.  If you look at the prerm script, it's using pycentral.  pycentral requires you to have a python-version in the package's control file.  This package doesn't do that.  Since you want to remove the package, and it didn't use pycentral when it installed since it errored there too, I would just get rid of that in the prerm script, make it go to the else clause
[07:46] <l3mr> lakin: this is weird, you do have grub installed? ( apt-get install grub )
[07:47] <lakin> l3mr: yes
[07:47] <Curio> yes i know but the fact is that does not work
[07:47] <lakin> I just --reinstalled it to make certain
[07:47] <LjL> lakin: ls /sbin/update-grub <- is it there?
[07:47] <lakin> l3mr: and now I have it.
[07:47] <reverseblade> nvicf, you can search it inthe forums, but a suggestion would be, to alter all "breezy" or "badgers" to "dapper"s
[07:47] <M3G4crux> hmmm lets see if I can do that.
[07:47] <l3mr> lakin: oh, sudo update-grub :)
[07:47] <nvicf> reverseblade, ahhh any forum in particular?
[07:47] <Music_Shuffle> ubuntuforums
[07:47] <nevron> can anybody help me please
[07:47] <reverseblade> nvicf, in the source.list file then run, sudo apt-get update , sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

[07:49] <reverseblade> nevron, apparently no
[07:49] <jrib> M3G4crux: the easiest way to do that would be to  put "false &&" in front of "which python" in the test that if does
[07:49] <reverseblade> nvicf, np, this is what "ubuntu" is
[07:49] <Vuen> LjL: thanks. is there a similar command for seeing what version of gnu tools i'm running? (commands like rm)
[07:49] <lakin> l3mr: yeah .. that's what I'm used to.  the partition that I have mounted for '/' doesn't have enough space ... I'll need to fix it this weekend.

[07:49] <godtvisken> I am getting a high pitched noise when recording with audacity, but testing with dd the pitch is not there. What's wrong? I can't check the version number because when I do About Audacity, the characters are just blocks.

[07:55] <reverseblade> elfreakz, you can't install AIGLX , it is built in enabled
[07:56] <PriceChild> reverseblade: you can install AIGLX on edgy
[07:56] <Seveas> PriceChild, it's included with the x serer
[07:56] <fenrig> !chess
[07:56] <PriceChild> reverseblade: there are however most of the AIGLX _extensions_ already in xorg7.1
[07:56] <reverseblade> PriceChild, no
[07:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about chess - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:56] <elfreakz> reverseblade, sudo apt-get install beryl = it say couldn find package?
[07:56] <reverseblade> elfreakz, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy
[07:56] <fenrig> no u cant play chess
[07:56] <Seveas> !beryl
[07:56] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[07:56] <PriceChild> elfreakz: add repositories
[07:56] <fenrig> with the bot unless he learns it
[07:57] <elfreakz> PriceChild, already.. i follow the tutorial add repositories..
[07:57] <reverseblade> elfreakz, because you have to add its  repos
[07:57] <PriceChild> elfreakz: what tutorial?
[07:57] <oobee> Is there a gnome menu editor of some kind?
[07:57] <PriceChild> mine?
[07:57] <PriceChild> oobee: alacarte
[07:57] <PriceChild> oobee: right click your meny and click "edit menus"

[07:58] <CharminTheMoose> i'm having a problem with ubuntu dapper drake.I'm trying to get my dell 1450 wireless usb adapter to work with wep encryption,so far I've been able to get it working without encryption but dmesg complains 'eth1:No ipv6 routers' and my adapter is on /dev/eth1.And dmesg says:ndiswrapper: wlan0 can use the folowing types of encryption and it then lists a load of encryption methods including wep. Anyone know how I can make this work?
[07:58] <PriceChild> Seveas: I'll get bored and move on soon :)
[07:58] <Seveas> hehe
[07:58] <elfreakz> PriceChild, this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy only show me to add session startup
[07:58] <PriceChild> elfreakz: just checking out that guide for me
[07:58] <Seveas> enjoy the champagne in #ubuntuforums :)
[07:59] <reverseblade> CharminTheMoose, too specific to answer, may I suggest you to disintigrate your question
[07:59] <ScreaminIke> uhm. right. i think this is an issue with x. i pulled out my nvidia to give it to some kid, and now x isn't configged properly. anyone know what i need to edit?
[07:59] <LjL> elfreakz: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy#head-d7a748b50ee93e622dae8307ba24295ec2ed1f3e
[07:59] <LjL> elfreakz: read carefully
[07:59] <reverseblade> ScreaminIke, what is wrong with X ?
[07:59] <jenda> How do I tell grub where my root partition is again?
[07:59] <CharminTheMoose> reverseblade:you want me to LOOSEN my question?
[07:59] <jenda> I thought it was root (0,2) in the grub shell
[07:59] <jenda> but that tells me unrecognised device.
[07:59] <Seveas> ScreaminIke, enter this command: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserer-xorg
[07:59] <CharminTheMoose> first time i've heard that
[07:59] <ScreaminIke> gives me an error when it tries to launch. i'm in prompts.
[07:59] <PriceChild> elfreakz: my personal guide is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263851&highlight=beryl+edgy
[07:59] <elfreakz> LjL, it didnt have Intel?
[08:00] <frogzoo> jenda: there's a line 'groot...)
[08:00] <LjL> elfreakz: ?
[08:00] <jenda> frogzoo: where?
[08:00] <PriceChild> elfreakz: I have another version that includes ATI & intel if you would prefer that one?
[08:00] <elfreakz> LjL, it only say ATI and Nvia
[08:00] <CharminTheMoose> ok,I have a dell 1450 wireless usb adapter, how can I get it working via wep?
[08:00] <frogzoo> jenda: in menu.lst
[08:00] <PriceChild> elfreakz: the ubuntu wiki version of my guide is COMPLETELY BROKEN
[08:00] <ScreaminIke> thx, seveas
[08:00] <elfreakz> PriceChild, will try urs
[08:00] <jenda> ah
[08:00] <PriceChild> elfreakz: what graphics card?
[08:00] <frogzoo> jenda: after updating, you need to run sudo update-grub
[08:00] <reverseblade> CharminTheMoose, I suggest it not ask it. just try to generalize the problem. e.g if I say, my enter key doesnt work after I do ctrl T, why ? . this is too specific and hard to answer
[08:01] <LjL> elfreakz: no it mentions Intel too, just not in the "driver installation" part - but that's because the relevant Intel driver is installed by default i guess
[08:01] <ScreaminIke> are you the same seveas that genned all thos metapackages?
[08:01] <Seveas> yes
[08:01] <Abst> In scteen how do I give a name to a window?
[08:01] <Abst> Man says C-a A, how do I do this
[08:01] <ScreaminIke> oh, no. it's scrolled past the command before i could type it. what was that, again, seveas?
[08:01] <Seveas> Abst, C-a is <ctrl>+a
[08:01] <Seveas> ScreaminIke, enter this command: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserer-xorg
[08:01] <knight17> By Linux Commands I meant BASH commands (I think I am correct)
[08:02] <jenda> frogzoo: thx
[08:02] <Seveas> ScreaminIke, enter this command: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:02] <PriceChild> elfreakz: ?
[08:02] <Abst> Seveas: How do I do Ctrl a A then
[08:02] <elfreakz> PriceChild, still working on it
[08:02] <Seveas> (first one had a typo)
[08:02] <jenda> frogzoo: wouldn't root (hd0,0) do it, then? :)
[08:02] <herzi> which package do I use to file bugs about /etc/fstab?
[08:02] <reverseblade> knight17, if you are using bash in your terminal, yes, if not no
[08:02] <herzi> (package as in launchpad package)
[08:02] <ScreaminIke> thx
[08:02] <Seveas> Abst, hit <ctrl>a, release it, hit <shift>a
[08:02] <ScreaminIke> that's REALLY helpful
[08:02] <ScreaminIke> i hope :)
[08:02] <jenda> nvm, thanks frogzoo
[08:02] <Abst> Thanks Seveas
[08:02] <Abst> !
[08:02] <Seveas> herzi, depends on the bug
[08:02] <jenda> on my way...
[08:02] <elfreakz> PriceChild, when adding deb URL.. do i have to start with # ?
[08:02] <PriceChild> elfreakz: what make of graphics card? intel?
[08:03] <PriceChild> elfreakz: leave out the =
[08:03] <PriceChild> *#
[08:03] <PriceChild> elfreakz: the # means the system skips it
[08:03] <reverseblade> elfreakz, in general # means comment it out in linux jargon
[08:03] <elfreakz> PriceChild, ok
[08:03] <herzi> Seveas: "Can't use USB drives" (because /dev/sdb is specified as a cd drive)
[08:03] <Capslock118> question
[08:03] <phlite_kontrol> hi, i'm having the hardest time getting my ubuntu 6.10 to update, keeps timing out, its like the servers are always busy?
[08:03] <Seveas> herzi, usb drives are not to be put in /etc/fstab
[08:03] <herzi> Seveas: right
[08:04] <LjL> phlite_kontrol: might be... try another mirror
[08:04] <Seveas> they should be recognized when plugged in
[08:04] <herzi> but there is this /dev/sdb entry for the cdrom
[08:04] <herzi> (and I don't have a cdrom)
[08:04] <phlite_kontrol> LjL: how to change mirror?
[08:04] <herzi> so the usb drive gets /dev/sdb
[08:04] <Capslock118> Error: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: could not open...this is what cedega outputs in the console when I try to install a game (WoW). does anyone know what this error means?
[08:04] <reverseblade> phlite_kontrol, some times it happens, try tomorrow
[08:04] <herzi> and then the file system in etc fstab is wrong
[08:04] <Seveas> herzi, and that entry was created when?
[08:04] <phlite_kontrol> reverseblade: this has happened for like 5 days now
[08:04] <herzi> and mount claims that it can't mount the pendrive
[08:04] <herzi> Seveas: install time
[08:04] <LjL> phlite_kontrol: you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change the URLs. where it says (for instance) "us.archive.ubuntu.com" you can change that to, say, "ca.archive.ubuntu.com"
[08:04] <Seveas> and at install time you had a CD-rom I guess :)
[08:04] <reverseblade> phlite_kontrol, another good reason to try it tomorrow :)
[08:05] <herzi> nope
[08:05] <phlite_kontrol> reverseblade: lame
[08:05] <herzi> i installed from a usb pendrive
[08:05] <Seveas> ahhhhh
[08:05] <phlite_kontrol> LjL: thx m8
[08:05] <herzi> (that notebook doesn't have a drive like cd/dvd)
[08:05] <reverseblade> phlite_kontrol, try changing the mirrors
[08:05] <elfreakz> PriceChild, after typing wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/root@lupine.me.uk.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -, then sudo apt-get update.....
[08:05] <Seveas> herzi, mention all that in the bug please and file it against the installer (ubiquity is the graphical installer, debian-installer is the command-line one)
[08:05] <PriceChild> elfreakz: ...
[08:05] <herzi> Seveas: thank's for your help
[08:06] <elfreakz> PriceChild, it say Malformed line 35 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist)
[08:06] <elfreakz> PriceChild, whats that?

[08:07] <ph8> any help / links to xorg.conf's would be appreciated, the internet seems to know nothing of the issue :/
[08:07] <PriceChild> Seveas: hehe yeah sorry :)

[08:09] <elfreakz> PriceChild, wait
[08:10] <gubluntu> how do i reconfigure my display?
[08:10] <elfreakz> PriceChild, just copy and paste then save that in sources.list?
[08:10] <gubluntu> that dpkg reconfigure thing
[08:11] <Seveas> gubluntu: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:11] <PriceChild> elfreakz: If i were you... I would look at the difference first... can you see why your line 35 wasn't correct? (it didn't have edgy main). Can you also see that you had more than one mirror in your sources?
[08:11] <drkm> I've just installed font new fonts..how do I update my fonts cache?
[08:11] <gubluntu> thanks Seveas
[08:11] <PriceChild> elfreakz: the "edgy main" part of the line basically tells apt what container on the url to look in

[08:12] <fallingdutch> is there a way to get an earlier version of a package
[08:12] <elfreakz> PriceChild, I will skip step 2 for nvidia driver right?

[08:14] <ubun> screamline about 1 page up i asked: i rebooted and when i try to play a movie now in mplayer it says 'Error: Could not open/initialize audio device -> no sound' and i have no sound! any idea why?
[08:14] <Capslock118> i think my repositories are messed up, i see docs for glibc but not glibc itself

[08:14] <ScreaminIke> try to pkill esd
[08:14] <PriceChild> Capslock118: what repositories?
[08:14] <ubun> i have sound in flash only, not in movies or mp3 players, worked fine before i rebooted
[08:14] <knight17> where can i get the list of all the BASH commands
[08:14] <ScreaminIke> sometimes that works for me
[08:14] <Capslock118> PriceChild: for x64 edgy
[08:15] <ubun> knight17 'man bash' should have them

[08:15] <Alarm> jrib:  i did install it. just the application cant find the directory. thats all
[08:15] <elfreakz> PriceChild, why the tutorial is using sudo nano??? can i use gedit?
[08:15] <PriceChild> elfreakz: replace with "gksudo gedit"
[08:15] <reverseblade> elfreakz, yes
[08:15] <Seveas> sudo gedit
[08:15] <Seveas> (gedit fails with gksudo, stupidly enough)
[08:15] <reverseblade> elfreakz, nano is more lightweight
[08:15] <jrib> Alarm: you said you didn't install it through the package manager
[08:16] <Alarm> i used the self extracting bin
[08:16] <PriceChild> Seveas: always works fine for me?
[08:16] <ScreaminIke> anyone know how to auto-config  x? like they did in the install scripts? is there a backup of those somewhere?
[08:16] <PriceChild> elfreakz: use gksudo if it works... sudo if it doesn't
[08:16] <jrib> Seveas: wfm too
[08:16] <Seveas> PriceChild, always fails for me :)
[08:16] <apokryphos> ScreaminIke: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[08:16] <Seveas> and I've heard it fail for others as well
[08:16] <PriceChild> ScreaminIke: sudo dpkg--reconfigure --phigh xserver-xorg
[08:16] <Seveas> so in a 'suitable for n00bs' guide, I'd say sudo :)
[08:16] <ScreaminIke> apokryphos, i'm in commandline
[08:16] <PriceChild> hmm ok... well either way, best to use it if it works
[08:17] <apokryphos> ScreaminIke: well, you can use dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:17] <jrib> Seveas: and at the same time we recommend gui apps be run with gksudo?
[08:17] <Capslock118> i dont understand why when i search glibc, only glibc-docs and -doc reference shows up...what about the actual glibc?
[08:17] <PriceChild> apokryphos: my code line before will reconfigure it automatically to first install without any input
[08:17] <PriceChild> apokryphos: uses a --phigh flag
[08:17] <elfreakz> PriceChild, done... how to see its successful?
[08:17] <Seveas> jrib, yes, nice and consistent ;)
[08:17] <jrib> Alarm: I understand that, I am suggesting you use the packaged java to fix your problem
[08:17] <PriceChild> elfreakz: where in the guide are you?

[08:18] <elfreakz> PriceChild, continue your tutorial for STEP 3 is it
[08:18] <PriceChild> Seveas: apokryphos: sorry...
[08:18] <Capslock118> reverseblade: in the console?
[08:18] <knight17> is there any way I can read them on windows
[08:18] <Seveas> reverseblade, what kind of nonsense is that?
[08:18] <PriceChild> elfreakz: probs best to continue guide from the latest link I gave you
[08:18] <Alarm> packaged java from repo is v5 if i am not wrong. there is v6 online
[08:18] <reverseblade> Seveas, what is non sense ?
[08:18] <Seveas> reverseblade, that question has nothing to do with #linux and a lot with #ubuntu
[08:18] <elfreakz> PriceChild, aight
[08:18] <PriceChild> Alarm: No.... freezes keep things stable
[08:18] <Seveas> Capslock118, the glibc package is called libc6
[08:19] <jrib> Capslock118: libc6 is what you are looking for.  Actually you probably just want to install build-essential
[08:19] <LjL> Capslock118: long story short, libc6 = glibc
[08:19] <reverseblade> Seveas, well I thought the reverse, since no one is responding, I thought guiding that way would be more convenient
[08:19] <Seveas> reverseblade, not at all
[08:19] <PriceChild> Alarm: only high priority bugfixes/security updates are applied to a releases
[08:19] <Seveas> it's very ubuntu specific
=== ExM3th1x_away is now known as ExM3th1x
[08:19] <reverseblade> Seveas, ok apologies, I was wrong
[08:19] <sobersabre> guys, does anybody here run ubuntu on an intel core 2 duo macbook  ?
[08:19] <Alarm> ok
[08:19] <Capslock118> ok, well, does that mean I have to do something to cedega for it to know to look for libc6 and not glibc?
[08:19] <Seveas> !anyone | sobersabre
[08:19] <ubotu> sobersabre: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:19] <Seveas> Capslock118, no
[08:19] <PriceChild> Seveas: I love that anyone message :)
[08:20] <LjL> Capslock118: are you sure it's looking for libc6 and not for the build tools and includes? (i.e. build-essential and friends)
[08:20] <Capslock118> here is the error message "/root/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-5.2.8/bin/winex3: 160: /root/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-5.2.8/winex/bin/pthreads_stack_test: not found

[08:21] <sobersabre> so... does somebody/anybody have a macbook with intel cpu and runs ubuntu ?
[08:21] <ph8> Seveas: I appear to have dual screen fglrx in the way i wanted finally, one weird thing though - when i run glxgears and/or play a movie, the right half appears on the left, and the left is outside the window
[08:21] <LjL> Capslock118: that just looks like that shell script is bad, to me... perhaps
[08:21] <PriceChild> !anyone | sobersabre
[08:21] <ubotu> sobersabre: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:21] <LjL> !dash | Capslock118
[08:21] <ph8> not overlapping outside, just off the left side
[08:21] <ubotu> Capslock118: /bin/sh links to the DASH shell in Ubuntu Edgy (6.10). Since DASH is not 100% compatible with the BASH shell, some scripts might break. You can make scripts execute using BASH by changing the first line of the script to "#!/bin/bash"
[08:21] <ph8> ever heard of anything like that?
[08:21] <Seveas> Capslock118, that's an error with cedega, poke them :)
[08:21] <phlite_kontrol> LjL: changing the mirror worked, thx
[08:21] <LjL> phlite_kontrol: cool
[08:21] <Seveas> ph8, server layout being weird?
[08:22] <Capslock118> ok so, yeah i heard i need to be under bash to get it to work, and i think i am under sh
[08:22] <ph8> in what way? i wouldn't have thought it could influence where things are displayed in their own window?
[08:22] <Seveas> ph8, it was just a wild guess :)
[08:23] <Capslock118> how do i change cedega to use bash and not dash?
[08:23] <emilia> anyone know how to restore my default network settings ? i think i screwed them up big time
[08:23] <Capslock118> or is that a console thing?
[08:23] <PriceChild> emilia: running gnome?
[08:23] <rag_> please help me , hi *
[08:23] <rag_> please help me , hi *
[08:23] <rag_>  why a rt61 wifi card not works command dhclient ra0?
[08:23] <PriceChild> emilia: And which settings in particular?
[08:23] <emilia> PriceChild:  yes
[08:23] <reverseblade> emilia, probably you can use System > Administration > Networking
[08:23] <emilia> PriceChild:  i was trying to do internet connection settings
[08:23] <PriceChild> emilia: what reverseblade said
[08:24] <emilia> PriceChild:  i was trying to do internet connection sharing**
=== Kimahri is now known as Tidus
[08:24] <PriceChild> emilia: ubuntu as gateway? or connecting?
[08:24] <ph8> Seveas: bizarrely, if i move my mouse to the far left (if it's playing on the left screen) the whole thing centres
[08:24] <reverseblade> emilia, or you can tweak /etc/network dir manually
[08:24] <ph8> but moves off to the left again as soon as i move away
[08:24] <Capslock118> ubotu: do i chance the console to directly use bash or do I tell cedega to use bash in some way?
[08:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about do i chance the console to directly use bash or do I tell cedega to use bash in some way? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:24] <dabaR_> sobersabre: look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuonMactel
[08:24] <emilia> PriceChild:  2 ubuntu computers, one cable modem, no router
[08:24] <klassicd> how would you rename all files in a directory to use a max name length of 64 but keep the first part of the filename in tact and the 4 character extension (.mp3 or .ogg)
[08:24] <emilia> PriceChild:  but both computers cant see eachother, and it was working amazing with windows :( i dont know what id id wrong
=== [shorty114]  is now known as shorty114
[08:25] <PriceChild> emilia: so modem -> ethernet -> ubuntu -> ethernet -> ubuntu ?
[08:25] <elfreakz> PriceChild, i think i have problem with STEP 4
[08:25] <emilia> PriceChild: yes
[08:25] <HuibertGill> klassicd: see "man cut" and a bit off bash scripting
[08:25] <cyzie> hello, previuosly im having grub error 17. i have done this by fixmbr using windows xp recovery disk. but i see no more grub boot loader. anyone can help?
[08:25] <PriceChild> emilia: The same settings on both computers "should" work... is neither working?
[08:25] <PriceChild> elfreakz: /me looks
[08:25] <elfreakz> PriceChild, it say edit the xorg.conf, add this to section "Screen"
[08:26] <klassicd> looking HuibertGill thanks
[08:26] <elfreakz> PriceChild, in which part do i have to add starting from # Enable 32-bit ARGB GLX Visuals......
[08:26] <PriceChild> elfreakz: don't do that
[08:26] <reverseblade> cyzie, try #grub as well
[08:26] <PriceChild> elfreakz: don't do either of those....
[08:26] <ubun> anyone know why i only have sound in flash, not in my mp3 players or movie players? (yes i have mp3 codecs installed) mplayer says "could no open/initialize audio device"
[08:26] <emilia> pricechild : they could both see eachother before, cause i was ftp'ing from one to the other, but when i tried to enable connection sharing, it screwed up, now i cant even ftp or vnc
[08:26] <elfreakz> PriceChild, dont do that.. ok
[08:26] <cyzie> reverseblade, no answer there
[08:26] <elfreakz> PriceChild, so then i skip it
[08:26] <PriceChild> elfreakz: I don't think you need ARGB, i think that's nvidia only
[08:26] <crimsun_> ubun: are you using Flash 9 beta 2 from backports?
[08:26] <PriceChild> elfreakz: don't use triplebuffer - definately not needed
[08:26] <godtvisken> Can anyone help? I get a high pitched ringing noise when I record somethin in audacity. I do hear what I actually recording, but a rining is underneath. I have tested with dd and it's not the microphone (no ringing there). What's wrong?
[08:27] <PriceChild> elfreakz: although if it doesn't work without ARGB then try with it on
[08:27] <reverseblade> godtvisken, you asked this may be an hour ago
[08:27] <dabaR_> cyzie: you can look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows that shows what to do.
[08:27] <godtvisken> reverseblade: so?
[08:27] <PriceChild> emilia: so neither pc can connect to the net?
[08:27] <Capslock118> how do i move to bash in the console?
[08:27] <reverseblade> godtvisken, nothing, I just remembered :)
[08:27] <ubun> crimsun_ im using flash 7, dapper
[08:27] <jrib> Capslock118: default is bash
[08:27] <emilia> PriceChild: no one can, this one im now, which hosts the cable modem
[08:27] <ubun> sound was working fine before but it just stopped after i rebooted
[08:27] <godtvisken> reverseblade: ok
[08:27] <cyzie> dabaR_, have tried there. no help
[08:27] <reverseblade> caplink811_log, bash   ?
[08:28] <jrib> Capslock118: (as you login shell, if that is what you are asking)
[08:28] <reverseblade> Capslock118, type bash
[08:28] <emilia> pricechild : brb
[08:28] <PriceChild> emilia: could you check system>admin>networking to see what settings are there and if there's any obvious silly things?
[08:28] <PriceChild> ok
[08:28] <ubun> do i have to 'chmod 777 /dev/dsp' or something
[08:28] <dabaR_> cyzie: that page tells what to do. What do you mean?
[08:28] <crimsun_> ubun: no, use the version in dapper-backports
[08:28] <bradley> hi. i have this weird issue-- my panel freezes if i right click on the bubbles in the window list. has anyone else had this problem? how is it fixed?
[08:28] <ubun> crimsun_ but im saying flash sounds *works*, it's other sound that doesnt
[08:28] <j2daosh> what is up people? i just built a c2d system yesterday. I attempted to install dapper (only cd i had at the moment) but it kept freezing. I'm reading that ubuntu does,'t currently have "proper" support for a c2d system on a intel 965 chipset board... is this correct? am i going to have to go to redhat/suse/debian?
[08:29] <mirkash> hi, I have problem with Xorg, it consumes lot of cpu time 70%
[08:29] <elfreakz> PriceChild, thanks i got it already :)
[08:29] <cyzie> dabaR_, didnt help
[08:29] <ph8> hmm, bit of an enigma :/
[08:29] <dabaR_> cyzie: what did you do?
[08:29] <PriceChild> elfreakz: you got teh wobbly? :)
[08:29] <ph8> Seveas: do you reckon i need to recalibrate xine in some way?
[08:29] <crimsun_> ubun: flash 7 is oss-based. It will prevent other apps from opening the sound device if your hardware doesn't support multiopen.
[08:29] <ph8> although, does glxgears use xine?
[08:29] <Capslock118> "ubotu" " You can make scripts execute using BASH by changing the first line of the script to "#!/bin/bash" -- if that is the case, and bash is my default console, then why would what ubotu said apply?
[08:29] <elfreakz> PriceChild, yeah its like red thinggy color, and i can move the 3D thinggy
[08:29] <Seveas> ph8, it does not
[08:29] <ubun> crimsun_ but that doesnt explain why my other apps were playin sound fine all week, until now
[08:29] <ubun> i had flash installed the whole week too
[08:30] <j2daosh> what is up people? i just built a c2d system yesterday. I attempted to install dapper (only cd i had at the moment) but it kept freezing. I'm reading that ubuntu does,'t currently have "proper" support for a c2d system on a intel 965 chipset board... is this correct? am i going to have to go to redhat/suse/debian?
[08:30] <cyzie> dabaR_, before the moment install windows vista on the laptop, it complain not enough disk space. then i abort the installation and then reboot, i got the error 17. then i use win xp recovery disk to fixmbr. now no more grub bootloader and straight away boot into windows xp
[08:30] <jrib> Capslock118: I said it was your default login shell.  That's not the same as what /bin/sh points to.  sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash  if you want to use bash all the time instead of dash
[08:30] <crimsun_> ubun: no, it doesn't, but the easiest way for me to troubleshoot is to ask you to update to the version of flash that supports alsa natively
[08:30] <PriceChild> elf... open up beryll-settings-manager... go to the animations tab, and change "Close Effect 2" to "Burn" ;)
[08:30] <dabaR_> cyzie: and yuo say you followed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows, which instructions in there did you follow? there are 3 sets.
[08:31] <ubun> i installed alsa-oss which was supposed to fix it but it didnt :[ guess ill have to, im just gonna upgrade to edgy, cant stand 'stable' anymore it's not so stable :p
[08:31] <ubun> debian is backwards
[08:31] <Capslock118> jrib: thank you
[08:31] <crimsun_> ubun: alsa-oss is a hack. You do not need to dist-upgrade to edgy. Just enable dapper-backports.
[08:31] <HuibertGill> ubun: debian is "the core"
[08:31] <cyzie> dabaR_, currently in the laptop, i have windows xp home edition and debian etch. does the link help :(
[08:32] <ubun> crimsun_:  ok
[08:32] <ubun> !backports
[08:32] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[08:32] <dabaR_> cyzie: what are you saying, that your ubuntu got erased, or that you are missing the grub? cause the link shows how to recover grub after fixmbr erases it.
[08:33] <mirkash> hi, I have problem with Xorg, it consumes lot of cpu time 70%
[08:33] <cyzie> dabaR_, i never got ubuntu in my laptop. only windows xp and debian etch
[08:33] <Caco_Patane> Hallo
[08:33] <dabaR_> cyzie: OK, so then you need to talk to people in #debian, and keep that link as a reference if you do not get anything better,.
[08:33] <ubun> crimsun_: if i was recommending to my friend to install ubuntu and he wanted the latest software should i tell him to install edgy or to install dapper and then enable backports?
[08:34] <Caco_Patane> is there any file in witch i can specify some commands to run when i boot the system?
[08:34] <PriceChild> ubun: Edgy :P
[08:34] <ubun> Caco_Patane: system->administration->sessions i think
[08:34] <frogzoo> Caco_Patane: /etc/rc.local should do it
[08:34] <Capslock118> this is what i get now "1. root@joel-desktop:/home/joel# cedega 2. /root/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-5.2.8/bin/winex3: line 143: /root/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-5.2.8/winex/bin/pthreads_stack_test: No such file or directory 3. /root/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-5.2.8/bin/winex3: line 144: [: -gt: unary operator expected"
[08:35] <Capslock118> does anyone know what that means?
[08:35] <ubun> is it possible to switch to kubuntu edgy from within dapper and have it be as clean as doing a fresh install?
[08:35] <jrib> Capslock118: why not ask cedega for support?
[08:35] <dabaR_> Caco_Patane: /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
[08:35] <Capslock118> i am doing both
[08:36] <PriceChild> Capslock118: please ask cedega for support
[08:36] <PriceChild> Capslock118: because of course you have bought it legally.... you therefore have support from them in their forums

[08:55] <HyperDevil> can i set the output of a command into a variable ? ls -al >> $output
[08:55] <Curs0r> HyperDevil, it think its $(output)
[08:55] <HyperDevil> Curs0r: why ()?
[08:55] <Curs0r> like apt-get install linux-restricted$(uname -r)
[08:56] <cyzie> hello, when i apt-get for new kernel, i remembered 2 files need to apt-get . 1 is linux-image-2.6.x but i cant recall the other 1. anyone got any idea?
[08:56] <georover> Hyper: try $output=`command`
[08:56] <HyperDevil> the $output variable is not excisting.. i want to put the output of several commands into a variable..
[08:57] <hdibani> Hyper: $output=`command` is what u need
[08:57] <HyperDevil> hdibani: this will not work for.. can i redirect the output of a commando to a variable?
[08:57] <HyperDevil> instead of making a variable a command
[08:58] <Curs0r> HyperDevil,  you might need to look into bash scripting for that
[08:58] <HyperDevil> i am working in a bash script
[08:58] <georover> Hyper: what do you mean by "several commands" into the variable?
[08:59] <HyperDevil> i have 30 cp commands, and i want the output (if something goes wrong in the copying) into 1 variable, so i can mail it every night to see if the backup went ok
[08:59] <kane77> why was upgrade to dapper so much more discussed and longed for?? (or was it just past few months I was deaf and blind??) :D
[09:00] <georover> hyper: try command1>file
[09:00] <georover> then command2 >> file
[09:00] <georover> then mailx -s "subject" < file
[09:00] <HyperDevil> thats cool, but i dont want to create a file.. is it possible to take the output of all those commands in one variable?
[09:00] <georover> or similar mail tool
[09:00] <nvicf> damn it booted with the old one
[09:01] <georover> wellllll, $outout=`command1`
[09:01] <nvicf> the dault
[09:01] <georover> then $output=${output}`command2`
[09:01] <georover> ad nauseum

[09:02] <kosnick> can i format a disk as ntfs from ubunut? i already have ntfs-3g for writing to it
[09:02] <mumrah> i'm trying to dual boot windows and ubuntu and i'm having some difficulties with windows
[09:02] <HyperDevil> georover: then im putting a command into a variabel.. thats actually the other way around.. and requires me to rewrite my hude backup script
[09:03] <HyperDevil> huge
[09:03] <DBO> ***There will be a classroom on the Linux Kernel for newbies in #ubuntu-classroom in 0 minutes***
[09:03] <georover> you want to execute the contents of the variable?
[09:03] <mumrah> windows says the disk does not have a valid partition even though i've formated it to fat32 in ubuntu
[09:03] <HyperDevil> no i want the output of a commando into a variable with the variable=command
[09:04] <georover> to do that you use eval
[09:04] <HyperDevil> without
[09:05] <j2daosh> anyone running a c2d system with ubuntu?

[09:05] <Nookie^> hi! i have used my wireless before and now i cant use it anymore... i can connect to the network and i get an ip... I can also ping my router but i can go surf around on internet... any ideas??
[09:06] <j2daosh> no route set?
[09:06] <georover> hyper: so output=`command` assigns the output of the command to variable named output
[09:06] <clayg> hey, whats a good gps app for ubuntu?  something with a map
[09:06] <s1gma> j2daosh: No it's a cheap and nasty upgrade : Asrock with DDR : but I have 2 raid0 arrays
[09:06] <rrichar1> nookie try `sudo dhclient`
[09:06] <stefg> Nookie^: look at your /etc/resolv.conf, ig there's a valid name-server entry
[09:07] <georover> then output=${output}`command` tacks the output of the second command onto the variablr named output
[09:07] <HyperDevil> georover: i see your point, you are right.. but i want to do it the other way around actually
[09:07] <s1gma> j2daosh: kubuntu takes 15seconds to boot
[09:07] <HyperDevil> cp bla bbla1 >> $output
[09:07] <j2daosh> i cant get it to even load the livecd....
[09:07] <HyperDevil> georeover: and $output is just a variable.. not a file
[09:08] <j2daosh> hangs on trying to mount the filesystem.... no jmicron support apparantly
[09:08] <j2daosh> s/apparantly/apparently
[09:08] <georover> hyper: I see, you've been using a file, now want to switch to a vaiable
[09:08] <s1gma> j2daosh: what filesystem are you using ?
[09:08] <j2daosh> whatever the livecd uses...
[09:09] <j2daosh> iso9660?
[09:09] <HyperDevil> georover: actually there is no file, i just want the output to a variable and send the variabel via mail.. so no file creation
[09:09] <Nookie^> stefg: Yes i see there is my router ip
[09:09] <s1gma> j2daosh: what I mean is what disks are you trying to install the livecd to
[09:10] <j2daosh> just a 250 gig harddrive off the primary ide...
[09:10] <Nookie^> rrichar1
[09:10] <Nookie^> rrichar1
[09:10] <Nookie^> thanx DUDE
[09:10] <Nookie^> it worked
[09:10] <j2daosh> they are pata's so i was kinda screwed when i did the upgrade
[09:10] <rrichar1> I just installed the latest fglrx (8.32.5) and now it seems that direct rendering is disabled in my XGL session, it appears to be working in my regular gnome session any ideas?
[09:10] <j2daosh> all 6 of my big drives are pata
[09:10] <georover> well, the >> operator is a file operator you'll have to so some kind of x=x+y thing. The varianle has to be on the left hand side of the assignment operator
[09:10] <rrichar1> nookie: np
[09:10] <stefg> Nookie^: i assume that DNS is not working in your case.. specify another DNS server as well, to see if your routers' DNS service fails
[09:10] <mjr> rrichar1, that's normal, XGL doesn't do direct rendering from clients
[09:11] <j2daosh> and my pci ide controller isn't recognized... so all the data i backed up before the upgrade can't be used
[09:11] <s1gma> j2daosh: what error are you getting and where ?
[09:11] <Thuryn> I'll find out
[09:11] <rrichar1> mjr: beryl seems to be operating very slowly since uppgraded fglrx
[09:11] <j2daosh> no error, hangs on mounting filesystem off the cd
[09:12] <Leto> hi
[09:12] <sysrage> if you put the backports 'repo' in your sources.list should you -always- use it? or is it ok to enable it, install something you want from it, then disable it?
[09:12] <j2daosh> it wont even boot up to the live part
[09:12] <HyperDevil> georover: pretty pain in the ass hehe, maybe there is another command that does do this?
[09:12] <s1gma> j2daosh: Oh ic

[09:12] <j2daosh> sysrage, if you want upgrades to your app... leave it on there
[09:12] <ph8> i wonder if i can mod ubuntu to always pass that in on start
[09:12] <sysrage> j2daosh: so it won't effect any packages that didn't come from it?
[09:12] <christiane> Hello. I installed fglrx-driver to run an X1300/X1400 ATI on ubuntu 6.10. I followed the steps described in the wiki pages (composite, overlay ...), but when I run `fglrxinfo` it says "penGL vendor string: Mesa project: www.mesa3d.org". Maybe that's correct but I only get abou 10 fps when watching video. What to chekch first?
[09:13] <j2daosh> nope
[09:13] <sysrage> ok good. thanks
[09:13] <s1gma> j2daosh: Could be a number of things !
[09:13] <rrichar1> has anyone seens slowness in xgl since upgrading the fglrx driver?
[09:13] <ph8> christiane: can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
[09:13] <georover> I was just playing with it in a terminal, you lose all the line feeds when you send the output to the variable anyway
[09:13] <georover> not very effective for emailing
[09:13] <HyperDevil> georover: aargh, because if i have to edit this script that way i have to edit about 900 lines of code :P
[09:14] <j2daosh> well from what i have heard s1gma is that ubuntu doesn't support the jmicron raid controller yet
[09:14] <s1gma> j2daosh: Theres always a way round

[09:15] <sysrage> ok then if i installed gaim from the normal repo, how do i upgrade to the one in backports? (i'm assuming backports has beta 5 in it?)
[09:15] <georover> hyper: that's what perl is for!

[09:16] <j2daosh> it doesn't even work with windows...
[09:16] <ZeZu> anyone have ubuntu running on PS3 ?
[09:16] <eilker> sysrage: so will it see the dvd palyer ?
[09:16] <HyperDevil> georover: if i have 30 cp commands and edit all the cp commands to output=cp .. etc.. does every cp then overwrite the variable?
[09:16] <andrej> bother ... so, if I have home on a separate partition, I just need to remember my network settings and go for it? :)
[09:16] <sysrage> eilker: nevermind. if you don't get what i just said pretend i didn't say anything at all

[09:22] <georover> hyper: the {} isolate the variable from the rest of the line, they're probably optional but safet

[09:34] <XiXaQ> How do I do "dir /s filename.ext" in linux? That is, find out where a spesific file is?
[09:34] <andrej> That it would b appallingly bad practice to try what you're trying
[09:34] <stefg> manmadha: oh, i don't know, but for things like that i'd rather use openssh or somthing like that...

[09:42] <somerville32> !ask | Desert88
[09:42] <ubotu> Desert88: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:42] <Random_Transit> Desert88, what's your question
[09:42] <regeya> Desert88: and just having amarok makes you retarded?  !ask
[09:42] <Desert88> k
[09:42] <regeya> so is the bod called Random_Transit now
[09:42] <Random_Transit> lol
[09:42] <regeya> s/bod/bot/
[09:42] <Random_Transit> nope
[09:42] <Desert88> well I was trying to listen to one of the radio streams and it says its playing but I dont hear anything
[09:42] <Random_Transit> i just speak a bit of french
[09:42] <Desert88> but sound works find on anything else
[09:42] <Random_Transit> hmm
[09:42] <madman91> anyone have any ideas with my problem
[09:43] <Desert88> like on firefox
[09:43] <Desert88> so its nothing with hardware
[09:43] <pop1348> ok thanks
[09:43] <Desert88> and I dont have any music files on this os
[09:43] <Desert88> so i cant test amarok any other way
[09:43] <regeya> well, I was at work for a while, but now it's time to mosey back home.  working on weekends sucks.
[09:43] <MikeD_> Can i reinstall from the live cd without losing all the data on my haddrive?
[09:43] <Random_Transit> Desert88, do you have amarok-arts installed?
[09:43] <Desert88> no
[09:43] <Neocorp> is there a way to "pin" a gdesklets-desklet to the desktop so it wont be minimized when clicking the "show desktop" icon?
[09:44] <Desert88> do i need that for amarok
[09:44] <saif> i am tring to change the sudoers file, that i should add default !env_reset, is it ok if i do this? (safe)
[09:44] <Random_Transit> Desert88, that's the problem
[09:44] <Desert88> ah ok
[09:44] <Desert88> I will go install it
[09:44] <saharaab> hallo
[09:44] <phonox> EVERYONE: can someone plz try to /msg me? christiane said my privacy settings seem to disallow it...
[09:44] <wheels3572> How do I go about using a .bin file under Ubuntu?
[09:44] <madman91> i plugged in a usb reader and it does not mount or show up anywhere.. its not in fdisk -l ... not in mount ... anyways.. i have the output of tail -f /var/log/syslog and kernel in the pastebin .. http://madman91.pastebin.ca/281470 .. any ideas?
[09:45] <saharaab> can anyone tell me what's better EXT3 or Reiser??
[09:45] <Neocorp> is there a way to "pin" a gdesklets-desklet to the desktop so it wont be minimized when clicking the "show desktop" icon?
[09:45] <phonox> thanks! enough. anyone experienced any problems messaging me?
[09:46] <phonox> hmm
[09:46] <Curs0r> does anyone know if opengl works over xdmcp?
[09:46] <wheels3572> What is a .bin file for Linux
[09:46] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, it could be a couple things
[09:46] <Curs0r> or more precisely, beryl?
[09:47] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, most likely an executable file
[09:47] <HYB> Does anyone know of a PHP editor with FTP for ubuntu?
[09:47] <phonox> wheels: executables are
[09:47] <wheels3572> Random_Transit, how do I unpack it?
[09:47] <Random_Transit> HYB, Zend Studio
[09:47] <HYB> Random_Transit, thanks <3
[09:47] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, ./filename.bin
[09:47] <Desert88> is there anything else I need to do after installing amarok arts to get it to work?
[09:47] <Desert88> because I installed it and restarted amarok and its still not working
[09:48] <phonox> wheels: you can chmod +x them and then execute by ./something.bin
[09:48] <graft> ugh, don't use arts
[09:48] <Random_Transit> Desert88, best bet is to open synaptic and search for amarok
[09:48] <madman91> saharaab: i heard that reisferfs is faster..
[09:48] <christiane_> Hello. What is the cleanest way to modprobe ndiswrapper at system start?
[09:48] <Desert88> thats what I did
[09:48] <HYB> Random_Transit, that's not free... is it?
[09:48] <Desert88> I installed amarok
[09:48] <madman91> saharaab: ext3 is slower.. but more stable i think... i'm sure my friend google knows :D
[09:48] <Desert88> and then installed arts
[09:48] <wheels3572> Random_Transit, Im having an issue ever since I updated to Edgy I cant see NOTHING on my desktop any idea why
[09:48] <graft> reiser is faster if you have directories with LOTS of files in 'em
[09:48] <cjtenny> hey somebody.... why is it that I can't seem to install any of the x-devel packages?  i get a bunch of apt and/or dpkg errors.....
[09:49] <wheels3572> it's like it's in another area
[09:49] <saharaab> can i convert reiser to ext3??
[09:49] <graft> otherwise i think they're pretty much equivalent...
[09:49] <cjtenny> ext is my preference
[09:49] <HYB> any one else with suggestions for a PHP editor with built in FTP?
[09:49] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, because edgy is buggy
[09:49] <graft> Desert88: seriously, don't use arts...
[09:49] <cjtenny> hey somebody.... why is it that I can't seem to install any of the x-devel packages?  i get a bunch of apt and/or dpkg errors.....
[09:49] <cjtenny> (in edgy)
[09:49] <wheels3572> But if I goto Thunar and click on Deskto
[09:49] <graft> cjtenny: like what?
[09:50] <wheels3572> I see EVERYTHING
[09:50] <ph8> HYB: gedit?
[09:50] <cjtenny> graft, hold on a sec lemme get one name
[09:50] <wasp_ems> hello..i have a laptop on 2.8mhz and 512ram..i am going to install bebian and kde on it..does anyone know if by adding karamba applets and panel will affect my overall performance?
[09:50] <madman91> saharaab: no idea... look it up
[09:50] <HYB> ph8, i don't think that has built in FTP
[09:50] <ph8> you can mount ftp filesystems with gnome
[09:50] <ph8> same thing
[09:50] <ugarit> my firefox 2.0 crahes every few minutes!  anyone else have this problem?
[09:50] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, sounds like the gnome-desktop executable is crashing
[09:50] <wasp_ems> ugarit, i do
[09:50] <cjtenny> graft, libglu1-mesa-dev depends libglu1-mesa certain version but a newer one is to be installed
[09:51] <wheels3572> I get no error msgs
[09:51] <wheels3572> I just cant see anything on desktop
[09:51] <cjtenny> graft, i'm trying to install opengl development libs
[09:51] <ugarit> wasp_ems: so I guess there's a bug!
[09:51] <wheels3572> but if I go into Thunar I can click on Desktop and see it all
[09:51] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, that's really odd...did you upgrade or is this a fresh install?
[09:51] <wheels3572> Upgrade
[09:51] <Random_Transit> ahh
[09:51] <Random_Transit> that's it then
[09:51] <graft> cjtenny: um, apt-cache policy libglu1-mesa-dev
[09:51] <wasp_ems> ugarit, yeah i guess so..i tried uninstalling and installing again but nothing..so i just added konqueror
[09:52] <Random_Transit> you're one of the many casualties of the dapper/edgy upgrade, wheels3572
[09:52] <wasp_ems> ugarit, probably will install an older version to be fine
[09:52] <wheels3572> Random_Transit, ok how do I fix this then lol
[09:52] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, my suggestion, back up your data, and reinstall edgy
[09:52] <madman91> i plugged in a usb reader and it does not mount or show up anywhere.. its not in fdisk -l ... not in mount ... anyways.. i have the output of tail -f /var/log/syslog and kernel in the pastebin .. http://madman91.pastebin.ca/281470 .. any ideas?
[09:52] <cjtenny> graft, what about it?
[09:53] <Nippoo> gr. ubuntu + SMB networks = not good.
[09:53] <wheels3572> I dont have my cd burner running so
[09:53] <wheels3572> I cant do that
[09:53] <Random_Transit> otherwise you're likely to see a whole mess of new problems
[09:53] <wheels3572> thats why I just did the upgrade
[09:53] <wheels3572> lol
[09:53] <graft> cjtenny: what version is it trying to install?
[09:53] <Random_Transit> wheels3572, then downgrade to Breezy for now
[09:53] <wheels3572> ok
[09:54] <Desert88> how can I get music from my ipod to amarok?
[09:54] <cjtenny> graft, it depends 6.5.1~20060817-0ubuntu3 but it's installing  6.5.1+cvs20060824 of libglu1-mesa (whatlibglu1-mesa-dev depends on)
[09:54] <Random_Transit> Desert88, right click on a song on the ipod and hit save to library
[09:55] <phonox> christiane: do you experience better video performance now?
[09:55] <Desert88> k
[09:55] <graft> cjtenny: um, you got some extra repositories in your sources.list?
[09:55] <ubun> how do i install flash 9 on ubuntu ? i have backports enabled
[09:55] <Random_Transit> ubun, you need wine
[09:55] <Flannel> Random_Transit: no he doesn't
[09:55] <ubun> i mean the player
[09:55] <Random_Transit> wha?!
[09:55] <ubun> i dont want to create flash movies :P
[09:55] <Random_Transit> really??
[09:55] <Flannel> ubun: it's in backports, so it should show up in your repository
[09:55] <cjtenny> graft, a few....
[09:55] <graft> ubun: you have to download the binary from adobe site
[09:55] <Flannel> !flash9
[09:55] <ubotu> flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[09:56] <wasp_ems> does anyone know the reasons that a cpu might be 100% most of the time when running applications?
[09:56] <ubun> flannel know what it's called in synaptic?
[09:56] <graft> cjtenny: apt-cache policy libglu1-mesa will show you where it's getting that cvs one from, disable that source and it oughta work
[09:56] <ubun> it's not under the name 'flash*'
[09:56] <Random_Transit> !backports
[09:56] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[09:56] <cjtenny> ok
[09:56] <cjtenny> hmm it's from http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy/main Packages
[09:56] <Flannel> ubun: you sure you have backports enabled?  I can't image it'd be called something without flash in the name.
[09:56] <cjtenny> graft, hmm it's from http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy/main Packages
[09:57] <tchris> Is there an easy way to get ubuntu 6.10 to support my widescreen? I have a Dell 2005FPW and an ATi X800
[09:57] <ubun> flannel well i did waht the docs said and uncommented the backports line from sources.list
[09:57] <ubun> or is there more i have to do ?
[09:57] <graft> cjtenny: urm. wtf. my edgy mirror doesn't have that...
[09:57] <Flannel> ubun: no, that's really it
[09:57] <cjtenny> graft, yeah mine's not listed in sources.list
[09:57] <cjtenny> graft, can you send me a good sources.list?
[09:57] <Zaggynl> which kernel is better suited for amd64: k7, 686 or 386?
[09:58] <Flannel> Zaggynl: none of those are 64bit kernels
[09:58] <ubun> flashplayer-nonfree is all that turns up in synaptic after adding backports, and it says it's verison 7.0.63
[09:58] <graft> um, i'm using http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu, cjtenny
[09:58] <Zaggynl> Flannel, actually I want to use 32bit :)
[09:58] <cjtenny> graft, cat souces.list | grep Packages yields nothing
[09:58] <cjtenny> graft, what?
[09:58] <Flannel> Zaggynl: using dapper? or edgy?
[09:58] <[Relic] > how do I list all installed packages?
[09:58] <Zaggynl> Flannel, dapper
[09:58] <Flannel> ubun: pastebin your sources.list please
[09:58] <Flannel> Zaggynl: k7 is amd specific, but any of those will work fine
[09:58] <graft> cjtenny: edit your sources.list and change archive.ubuntu.com to ftp.ussg.iu.edu
[09:58] <wheels3572> HOw do I go about finding that one file that I have here that I just downloaded
[09:58] <cjtenny> ok....
[09:59] <Desert88> Hey whoever told me to add music from my ipod to amarok, right click and click add to lib, I dont get that option when I right click a track on my ipod, any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[09:59] <cjtenny> graft, for every source?
[09:59] <Zaggynl> Flannel, I'm wondering if there will be any performance boost between 386 and k7
[09:59] <cjtenny> and graft, is that ok for edgy?
[09:59] <cjtenny> graft, also -- is that plenty fast?
[09:59] <Flannel> Zaggynl: yeah, normal optomization stuff
[09:59] <ubul4> i just installed ubuntu. it reports the sound card as 'ALI 5451', but there is no sound. Anyone got an idea as where to look?
[09:59] <graft> cjtenny: yeah it's an ubuntu mirror, not sure why there's the diff... it's a university line, so it's hella fast
[09:59] <tchris> Is there an easy way to get ubuntu 6.10 to support my widescreen? I have a Dell 2005FPW and an ATi X800
[10:00] <vanberge> tchris: you probably need to install the ati drivers
[10:00] <wheels3572> Random_Transit, How do I go about finding a file I just downloaded and knowing where it's path is?  Can I do it via cli so I know the exact path?
[10:00] <tchris> there are no widescreen resolutions available
[10:00] <Flannel> tchris: so, add one
[10:00] <graft> ubul4: sure you have all the appropriate mixer volumes turned up?
[10:00] <cjtenny> so graft i change to ftp:/ftp.ussg.iu.edu/ ?
[10:01] <tchris> Flannel, is there a way to do this without editing large, confusing text files?
[10:01] <vanberge> can anybody comment on feisty's wlan support?  i have a wlan card that has yet to be supported in any single *nix
[10:01] <cjtenny> (change http://*/ to that?)
[10:01] <ubun> flannel my bad, i didnt uncomment both backport lines, didnt notice the second one, works now :)
[10:01] <graft> cjtenny: http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/, not ftp:
[10:01] <cjtenny> ok
[10:01] <ubul4> graft: yes the ALSA mixer looks ok.
[10:01] <vanberge> ^ card mentioned above = netgear WG511 v2
[10:01] <graft> ubul4: um, cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp
[10:01] <Flannel> graft: don't be stupid
[10:01] <bruenig> vanberge, I would assume #ubuntu+1 would be able to field that question better
[10:02] <graft> Flannel: beg pardon?
[10:02] <vanberge> !#ubuntu+1 | vanberge

[10:03] <madman91> ubun: if you find an answer to your question please tell me it :D i too want to experiment with firefox 2
[10:03] <Desert88> hey guys Im going insane
[10:03] <Desert88> I cant here anything out of amarok

[10:04] <drkm> Des: test
[10:04] <Desert88> so anyone have any ideas
[10:04] <Flannel> !firefox | madman91, ubun
[10:04] <ubun> ah man, i uninstalled flash7 player and sound was working again, then i installed flash 9 player and it's back to not working (in my mp3 players)
[10:04] <ubotu> madman91, ubun: firefox is the default web-browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion Installing plugins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxPlugins
[10:04] <Desert88> why I cant hear anything out of amarok
[10:04] <bruenig> madman91, you can get the firefox from getfirefox.com, all you have to do is extract it and run the firefox script in the directory
[10:04] <drkm> :deser:
[10:04] <drkm> :Des
[10:04] <drkm> Des: test

[10:13] <noelferreira> nothing vanberge
[10:13] <Administrator> noelferreira, you can not use rt61 driver using smp / preempt kernel.
[10:13] <noelferreira> open wireless. only mac adress
[10:13] <vanberge> noelferreira: sorry, that was my only suggestion...  :-/
[10:14] <Administrator> noelferreira, use 386 kernel

[10:15] <Administrator> noelferreira, You can read all about the issues on the rt61 and rt related driver forums.
[10:15] <noelferreira> Administrator: i have to delete /etc/network/interfaces fie
[10:15] <Administrator> noelferreira, you could use wpa.
[10:15] <noelferreira> lol Administrator i spend my time in there

[10:15] <noelferreira> i dont need encryptation Administrator
[10:16] <Administrator> noelferreira, show me your /etc/network/interfaces
[10:16] <Administrator> you can use wpa without encryption to

[10:16] <noelferreira> or my system hang up

[10:18] <Moosejaw> hey all...how can i get streaming video in firefox if it needs windows media player 10?
[10:19] <ubul4> how do I install packages without an internet connection?
[10:19] <Capslock118> mats: yeah, im sure it wont work right when i run the game, but its atleast installing WoW
[10:19] <narvik86> jughead: i think you can only check it in BIOS
[10:19] <Duesentrieb> Desert88: if you are using kde, i would recommend arts. under gnome, not.
[10:19] <ub12> Desert88 I have used arts before but remember there were some timeout issues
[10:19] <noelferreira> ok Administrator its not because of the file. its because of the part related with ra0
[10:19] <jughead> oh ok thanks narvik86
[10:19] <noelferreira> but i don't use eth0 so the file is not necessary
[10:19] <Administrator> noelferreira, then just comment it out and write your own script that setups ra0
[10:19] <Desert88> ok
[10:19] <mats> ubul4: dpkg -i file.deb
[10:19] <Administrator> noelferreira, altough I think you misconfigured your /etc/network/ineterfaces
[10:20] <Moosejaw> hey all...how can i get streaming video in firefox if it needs windows media player 10?  Can anyone help me out?
[10:20] <graft> Moosejaw: is it DRM'd?
[10:20] <mats> Moosejaw: i think VLC has a plugin for firefox
[10:20] <strabes> Moosejaw: mplayer firefox plugin
[10:20] <strabes> or vlc
[10:20] <Administrator> Moosejaw, install w32codecs and juse mplayerplugin
[10:20] <Fleebailey33> mozilla
[10:20] <Fleebailey33> so firefox would work
[10:20] <mats> ah, mplayer it is :p
[10:20] <ppd> g
[10:20] <Desert88> Im seriously going insane lol I cannot get any sound to come out of amarok
[10:20] <Moosejaw> sure but this is specifically asking for windows media player
[10:20] <Desert88> streams say they are playing but I dont hear them
[10:21] <Moosejaw> but maybe i dont have the plugins installed i gues
[10:21] <ubul4> mats: and where can I get the .deb files?

[10:22] <Desert88> ?
[10:22] <mats> and then make cd insted of the net to make it get packes
[10:22] <strabes> Desert88: does sound work normally?
[10:22] <Administrator> noelferreira, well just use lo or whatever in /etc/network/interfaces and add another init startup script that setsup your ra0. check out /etc/init.d/skeleton

[10:27] <Moosejaw> theyre all installed
[10:27] <Administrator> iturk, yes there is, non-free and free. try bluefish for webdevelopment or screem, man apt-cache (search for 'search")
[10:27] <saharaab_> what's the default FS in ubuntu reiser or ext3?
[10:27] <Adlai> ext3
[10:27] <iturk> Administrator: you mean search for webdevelopment
[10:28] <mats> ext3
[10:28] <Moosejaw> Admin: could you possibly check the link and see if it plays for you?
[10:28] <Moosejaw> it doesnt make sense why it wouldnt stream
[10:28] <Administrator> iturk, search for editor and grep for tags like HTML
[10:28] <SpiX^> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37446/ ???
[10:29] <Administrator> iturk,some advice, try emacs, might take a while to get used to, but after you get used to it and you know what it is capable of, you'll love it. It's the most extensible editor out there. Try #emacs.
[10:29] <Administrator> #emacs
[10:29] <iturk> Administrator: apt-cache search editor | grep html -> proofgeneral-doc !! just this !!
[10:29] <Administrator> !emacs
[10:29] <ubotu> Text Editors: gedit (GNOME), Kate (KDE), terminal based: vi/vim, emacs, nano (user-friendly). HTML/CSS editors: !html; Programming: !code

[10:29] <ubotu> html is HyperText Markup Language, used to build webpages. Editors in Ubuntu: Bluefish, Quanta+, Screem. For howto on HTML coding, see: http://www.w3schools.com

[10:34] <iturk> tomh-: i will check it
[10:34] <gouki> !kubuntu | oneironaut
[10:34] <ubotu> oneironaut: Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
[10:34] <reverseblade> is GNASH usuable instead of flash, does it work in youtube ?
[10:34] <oneironaut> hehe thx gouki, i know that kubuntu is ubuntu with kde
[10:34] <iturk> Administrator: i will check bluefish
[10:35] <oneironaut> but i think my question is equal to ubuntu/kubuntu
[10:35] <Administrator> iturk, my personal favor: emacs.
[10:35] <kejoki42> oh, there's something besides emacs?  ;)
[10:35] <iturk> Administrator: i understand your point but if the ide its more user friendly then you can program more efficiently and more fast
[10:35] <reverseblade> Administrator, yes but real men use vim
[10:35] <mats> oneironaut: im a fan of rtfm :p try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions
[10:36] <Administrator> iturk, emacs works keyboard binding.
[10:36] <iturk> Administrator: i usually use vim but only for c programming
[10:36] <Administrator> i see.
[10:36] <reverseblade> vim rocks
[10:36] <jon_> I am an emacs guy myself
[10:36] <oneironaut> yes youre right mats.. but i thounght my questions is so simple that anyone can explain me the my failure in 1 minute
[10:36] <strabes> kind of a weird question: is there a way to turn off that annoying zooming rectangle that appears when I click a shortcut on my panel?
[10:37] <mats> reverseblade: gvim \o/
[10:37] <strabes> which signals that the program is being opend
[10:37] <reverseblade> mats, same stuff

[10:43] <strabes> what file system is 8, and is it in your /etc/fstab
[10:43] <strabes> christiane:  what file system is 8, and is it in your /etc/fstab, and is it /dev/sda8?
[10:43] <jon_> OpenGL on a vga card - not the best idea
[10:44] <jon_> if so is /dev/sda8 in /media/

[10:46] <strabes> christiane: 8 has no file system type? that's probably why ubuntu isn't recognizing it. it doesn't know what it is. you need to install gparted and format it as something, and then mount it in /etc/fstab

However, grub takes about a minute to load and show the operating systems. I'm thinking I need to change something there but I don't ...
[10:49] <foo> ... know what exactly, any ideas?
[10:49] <jon_> christiane:  if you can see it in gparted then you could format it

[10:51] <christiane> jon_: I'm using bash right now.
[10:52] <jon_> christiane:  no nor really but the tool i was talking about is in gnome
[10:52] <jon_> christiane:  if you are running kde than you would use a different tool
[10:53] <levander> Duesentrieb: any idea what package that application is in?
[10:53] <Duesentrieb> levander: doesn't seem to be in the repos
[10:53] <levander> damn
[10:53] <matt_____> can someone walk me through setting up an extra hard drive to automount?
[10:53] <tarzan_> hi... i'm wondering.. gtk2/qt apps seem really unresponsive and slow compared to windows on my athlon 2000... is the cpu just to slow for today's linux widget libs or am i doing something wrong?
[10:53] <ub12> h0ndaracer2, just type "/usr/lib/mozilla"
[10:54] <jon_> matt_____ are you using gnome or kde
[10:54] <matt_____> gnome
[10:54] <christiane> jon_: I can't believe it. I created a fs with `parted` and now the device extsts.
[10:54] <h0ndaracer2> it dont work
[10:54] <fiveiron> anyone using lirc?
[10:54] <h0ndaracer2> even tho that is the location
[10:54] <Duesentrieb> levander: http://www.google.com/search?q=gruler+deb
=== tarzan_ is now known as frack
[10:55] <wuman> Hi somebody knows arstechnica.com? its a technology news blog, like slashdot, but i would like to be sure that information provided by arstechnica are reliable, anybody read this site everyday?
[10:55] <jon_> matt_____ you could use a nautilus script (in kde you would just right click and say automount)
[10:55] <h0ndaracer2> it says its not a directory
[10:55] <matt_____> are you saying i should give kde a try?
[10:55] <jon_> matt___ no not if that is all you want to do
[10:55] <strabes> matt_____: in gnome you can go to system -> preferences -> removable drives and media
[10:55] <itsmabus> When I boot up my system according to the tutorial on encrypting root/swap with dm-crypt.. it says that /etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz cannot be found. What should I do? I believe it's preventing me from entering my password correctly, because I can't enter it in to decrypt the drives and I'm sure it's the right password (I JUST finished encrypting them)
[10:56] <jon_> matt___ let me look for something to help you
[10:56] <matt_____> so where would i find such a script? ah, but the disk is internal
[10:56] <Duesentrieb> levander: http://www.filewatcher.com/b/ftp/210.1.1.11/pub/ubuntu/kitty/pool/dapper/gruler.0.0.html
[10:56] <strabes> matt_____: so it's always plugged in?
[10:56] <matt_____> yes, its mounted, i just don't want to have to mount it everytime i restart manually
=== jprieur-macbook is now known as jprieur
[10:57] <strabes> matt_____: is it always plugged in? you should be able to put it in your /etc/fstab then
[10:57] <matt_____> i looked into that, but it looked confusing
[10:57] <strabes> matt_____: that's the only way to do it
[10:57] <strabes> what is the location of the drive
[10:57] <WhiteRabit> this is probably a really simple question but its killing me..... why does my ubuntu machine fade to black after 10 minutes or so? I have the screensaver and powermanagment turned off........
[10:57] <jon_> matt___ use Gnome-volume-manager
[10:57] <drkm> where can I go to add more fonts?
[10:57] <strabes> matt_____: sdb something or other
[10:57] <matt_____> i was going to give it a try, but i was wondering if i accident'y placed it in the wrong place, if it would mess up everything.
[10:58] <jon_> matt___ use  Gnome-volume-manager to auto mount in gnome
[10:58] <strabes> matt_____: if your x server breaks you can always still edit files using a virtual terminal or by using the failsafe grub option
[10:58] <h0ndaracer2> i get this wat am i doing wrng Please enter the installation path of the Mozilla, Netscape,or Opera browser (i.e., /usr/lib/mozilla): home/h0ndaracer2/usr/lib/mozilla     WARNING: /home/h0ndaracer2/Desktop/install_flash_player_7_linux/home/h0ndaracer2/usr/lib/mozilla is not a directory.
[10:58] <strabes> matt_____: using nano instead of gedit
[10:58] <matt_____> does /dev/hdb sound right?
[10:58] <strabes> matt_____: yes, that's the most likely place
[10:58] <jevangelo> ubuntu sparc allows you to install using the lamp install option right?
[10:58] <matt_____> so
[10:59] <matt_____> what do i want to ADD to fstab?
[10:59] <jon_> matt___ if x breaks you could use nano, vi, or emacs to edit the files
[10:59] <strabes> jon_: i just said that :)
[11:00] <jon_> I lag :(
[11:00] <jon_> I lag on irc - it is a sad day
[11:00] <strabes> matt_____: you're going to want to add a line that says something like "/dev/sdb /media/nameyouwant ext3 defaults 0 0"
[11:00] <strabes> matt_____: and you'll also have to "sudo mkdir /media/nameyouwant"
[11:01] <matt_____> ok, i used nano instead of gedit, it loks a whole lot simpler
[11:01] <matt_____> oh, i already have it at /home/matt/data
[11:01] <strabes> matt_____: to save files in nano, use ctrl + o, and to exit use ctrl + x
[11:01] <strabes> matt_____: you already have /home/matt/data made?
[11:01] <matt_____> yes
[11:02] <strabes> then change the /media/nameyouwant in the fstab line i wrote to /home/matt/data
[11:02] <slicky_> i have retard computer it likes to play stupid game all time
[11:02] <strabes> matt_____: what is it formatted to?
[11:02] <matt_____> what do i type for option?
[11:02] <strabes> matt_____: i mean what filesystem is it
[11:02] <matt_____> its ext3
[11:02] <strabes> ok
[11:02] <jevangelo> does ubuntu sparc 6.06 give you an option for a lamp server?
[11:03] <strabes> matt_____: /dev/sdb /home/matt/data ext3 defaults 0 0
[11:03] <ubun> ugh, ok so i enable backports and install flash9 and it fixes all my sound movies, great, PROBLEM is now X keeps crashing and like big time crashing where i cna't even ctrl+alt+backspace out, i have to hit the reset button :/. i want to move my important data to /media/hda1 and burn from my windows partition but it wont let me copy, says it's a read-only file system. any ideas?
[11:03] <matt_____> and what is the defaults and 0   0 doing?
[11:04] <strabes> matt_____: never mind about those, just put them in there
[11:04] <ace> i'm back
[11:04] <strabes> matt_____: what does sudo fdisk -l return?
[11:04] <matt_____> ok, im going to save, and restart to test it, if i just do ctr alt backspace, will that work?
[11:05] <strabes> matt_____: no you'll have to restart your computer. don't do it yet though
[11:05] <strabes> matt_____: i want to make sure you have the right /dev/ location
[11:05] <kittykitty> i'm having a problem with ubuntu after i moved it from one computer to another, X doesnt find any screens and the error is (EE) No devices detected.
[11:05] <strabes> matt_____: what does sudo fdisk -l return?
[11:06] <matt_____> looks like invalid
[11:06] <matt_____> fdisk: invalid option -- 1
[11:06] <matt_____> Usage: fdisk [-b SSZ]  [-u]  DISK     Change partition table
[11:06] <fiveiron> anyone?
[11:06] <matt_____>        fdisk -l [-b SSZ]  [-u]  DISK  List partition table(s)
[11:06] <matt_____>        fdisk -s PARTITION           Give partition size(s) in blocks
[11:06] <matt_____>        fdisk -v                     Give fdisk version
[11:06] <matt_____> Here DISK is something like /dev/hdb or /dev/sda
[11:06] <matt_____> and PARTITION is something like /dev/hda7
[11:06] <matt_____> -u: give Start and End in sector (instead of cylinder) units
[11:06] <matt_____> -b 2048: (for certain MO disks) use 2048-byte sectors
[11:06] <strabes> kittykitty: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:07] <matt_____> wait! i think i need to add a 1 at the end of the decice in /etc/fstab
[11:07] <matt_____> sound right?
[11:07] <matt_____> for the partition, not the drive?
[11:07] <strabes> matt_____: probably but you typed the fdisk wrong
[11:07] <strabes> it's an -L not 1
[11:07] <strabes> lowercase L
[11:07] <matt_____> oh, lol
[11:07] <strabes> sudo fdisk -l
[11:07] <strabes> what does that return?
[11:08] <[Relic] > anyone good with disk mount problems of a disk that was divided into sections?
[11:08] <Infeliz> change ur stupid nick matt_____

[11:11] <matt_____> i need to add me a 1 don't i to the /etc/fstab
[11:11] <SilentDis> 'lo :)
[11:11] <prower> Hello :> Kind of an off-topic question, but does anyone use Demonoid much here?
[11:12] <SilentDis> demonoid?
[11:12] <SilentDis> !demonoid
[11:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about demonoid - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:12] <strabes> [relic] : did you format /dev/sda3 as ext3?
[11:12] <prower> SilentDis: It's a torrent site :>
[11:12] <SilentDis> prower: ahhhh
[11:12] <matt_____> do i need to add the 1?
[11:12] <SilentDis> prower:  apprarently, i am clueless on it.  ignorance is bliss!  :D
[11:13] <cafuego_> does it carry Ubuntu torrents?
[11:13] <strabes> matt_____: i don't know. try it and see
[11:13] <noelferreira> i have no audio ouput in edgy amd64 since i installed firefox for 32 bits. i follow this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava. Does anyone knows why?
[11:13] <matt_____> rebooting!
[11:14] <jhasse> does somebody know a svn gui?
[11:14] <[Relic] > strabes, I don't think it is formatted, I oringially thought the program I used to divide it up was doing that and since I wasn't going to use that section till I needed to back up I never checked it
[11:14] <sm0kie_> is debian == ubuntu ???
[11:14] <jrib> jhasse: rapidsvn
[11:14] <sm0kie_> similar?
[11:14] <Moosejaw> whats the keyboard command to take a screenshot?
[11:15] <cafuego_> sm0kie_: Debian is not Ubuntu. They both use .deb format packages.
[11:15] <jrib> Moosejaw: PrintScreen
[11:15] <strabes> [Relic] : ok then sudo apt-get install gparted
[11:15] <strabes> [Relic] : then run sudo gparted &
[11:15] <b08y> Moosejaw: Print button, under GNOME
[11:15] <strabes> then format /dev/sda3 as ext3
[11:15] <strabes> then talk to me
[11:15] <noelferreira> please help!
[11:15] <noelferreira> please help!
[11:16] <noelferreira> i have no audio ouput in edgy amd64 since i installed firefox for 32 bits. i follow this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava. Does anyone knows why?
[11:16] <SilentDis> apparently, exploits for Windows Vista are ON SALE now, some hitting the $20k and up mark.  i think we're all in the wrong business.  O.o
[11:16] <ub12> Moosejaw use the "print Screen" button top right hand corner next to the F12 key
[11:17] <sm0kie_> everybody give me a hip hip cuz im going to install ubuntu now
[11:17] <sm0kie_> :)
[11:18] <kittykitty> thanks strabes
[11:18] <SilentDis> sm0kie_:  welcome to the fold :)
[11:18] <strabes> kittykitty: it worked? cool glad i could help
[11:19] <kittykitty> yeah took 2 reboots cause auto detect broke at both graphic card and monitor :P
[11:19] <strabes> kittykitty: yeah that is a pain sometimes
[11:19] <matt_____> hello? after i rebooted and trying to automount a drive after editing fstab, the drive didn't mount, and i can't mount it manually
[11:19] <strabes> sm0kie_: hip hip
[11:20] <SilentDis> matt:  what are you trying to mount, and what error is given?
[11:20] <[Relic] > strabes, that was the problem, guess it never actually got formatted
[11:20] <matt_____> strabes was helping me, but, im trying to mount a 200gb hard drive (internal), there is no error, it just didn't mount
[11:20] <kittykitty> what command are you using to mount it matt?
[11:21] <strabes> matt_____ kittykitty: he's trying to do it in fstab
[11:21] <strabes> [Relic] : ok so now it's formatted as ext3 right?
[11:21] <matt_____> i edited /etc/fstab
[11:21] <matt_____> yes
[11:21] <Darst> Can someone please help - dire situation - Ubunut wont boot up and i have some digital photos that havent been backed up... diagnosis or at least suggestions on where to start Googling is needed - please
[11:21] <bradley> i am looking for a substitute for the window list for my panel. i want something that just displays icons without words. does anyone know of an applet like this?
[11:21] <SilentDis> matt:  what was the line in /etc/fstab you used, and have you ever got it to mount from a prompt?
[11:21] <Darst> *Ubunut
[11:21] <[Relic] > strabes, yes
[11:21] <kittykitty> goto shell type in "mount <shortname>"
[11:21] <kittykitty> tell us what it says
[11:21] <Darst> *Ubuntu... you can see I am stressed :P
[11:21] <matt_____> shortname?
[11:21] <strabes> [Relic] : ok where do you want to mount it? i would recommend somewhere in /media
[11:21] <SilentDis> Darst:  how far does it get, any errors, what happens exactly?
[11:21] <green_earz> matt_____: dose the machine boot to the command line ?
[11:21] <matt_____> i mounted it in /home/matt/data
[11:22] <kittykitty> in fstab you can give them shortnames instead of /dev/ or /mnt/ directories
[11:22] <matt_____> how....
[11:22] <kittykitty> anyways, just try "mount /dev/devicename" then
[11:22] <matt_____> why...
[11:22] <[Relic] > strabes, already mounted it where I wanted it, however there is a locked lost+found directory on it
[11:22] <strabes> matt_____ needs to figure out where ubuntu is telling him his internal HD is
[11:22] <Darst> SilentDis the boot screen gets about a third of the way along the progress bar and then the logo goes grey, the hdd continues to be accessed (light allmost consgtant) and then nothing... just sits
[11:22] <Moosejaw> do any of you guys routinely use beryl/xgl???
[11:22] <strabes> [Relic] : where did you mount it? do a sudo chmod 777 -R /path/to/it
[11:22] <SilentDis> Darst:  got a live cd sitting around you can throw in and boot from?
[11:23] <strabes> Moosejaw: yes. !ask
[11:23] <strabes> !ask | Moosejaw
[11:23] <ubotu> Moosejaw: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:23] <Darst> SilentDis - yup able to boot (takes a really long time) from the CD
[11:23] <SilentDis> darst:  if anything, you can fsck the drive, and/or mount it and back up data at least.
[11:23] <Moosejaw> ?
[11:23] <strabes> Moosejaw: what do you want to know about xgl/beryl
[11:23] <kittykitty> i'm sure there are many manuals that cover the working of fstab but since this is a text based chat, me reading the manual to you is an intellectually bankrupt action
[11:23] <Darst> SilentDis fsck - will google that one...
[11:23] <medic30420> i have a problem with ssh, after doing some updates via apt-get, I can no longer remote into the box from any other computers.  i "ssh user@brokenbox" and get a password prompt, i enter in the correct password and get... Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-with-mic,password).  any help?
[11:23] <Moosejaw> nothing...just wondering if you guys have found it stable enough to run as default.
[11:23] <SilentDis> darst:  it's the file system checker
[11:23] <noelferreira> i have no audio ouput in edgy amd64 since i installed firefox for 32 bits. i follow this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava. Does anyone knows why?
[11:24] <SilentDis> !fsck | darst
[11:24] <ubotu> darst: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[11:24] <strabes> Moosejaw: if you install it correctly, it is very stable. i hear aiglx is even more stable if your card supports it
[11:24] <matt_____> i added this to fstab /dev/hdb1       /home/matt/data ext3    defaults        0       0
[11:24] <Moosejaw> how do i check if my card supports it?  where can i check?
[11:24] <Darst> SilentDis if I sudo touch /fastboot from the Cd will that avoid the fsck on the hdd boot next time ? (afayk)
[11:24] <strabes> matt_____ and everyone else helping him: matt just needs to know if the /dev/hdb1 is correct
[11:24] <kittykitty> ok matt, goto a shell and type "mount /dev/hdb1" and tell us the specific error
[11:25] <strabes> Darst: i believe so
[11:25] <SilentDis> matt:  try this:  /dev/hdb1 /home/matt/data ext3 defaults,rw,user 0 0
[11:25] <matt_____> so how to i check?
[11:25] <matt_____> try the other without the 1?
[11:25] <SilentDis> Darst:  nope, it won't.
[11:25] <kittykitty> just goto shell and see if you can actually mount the partition first
[11:25] <strabes> Moosejaw: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:25] <SilentDis> darst:  it's easy to run manually though.  do you know how many partitions on your machine, or is there just one?
[11:25] <kittykitty> if you can't there isn't any point in rebooting to see if fstab could
[11:25] <Darst> SilentDis OK then... should I be able to see the HDD from the CD boot
[11:25] <Darst> SilentDis just one
[11:26] <SilentDis> Darst:  from a terminal:  sudo fsck /dev/hda1
[11:26] <green_earz> Moosejaw: put the card in the machine and then goto > http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/  and see if the is a driver for it
[11:26] <Darst> SilentDis just waiting for it to boot from the CD at the moment...
[11:26] <strabes> matt_____ kittykitty: i would have told him to do that but i thought he knew where it was in /dev
[11:26] <matt_____> hum...now it won't mount. it would mount before i edited fstab
[11:26] <SilentDis> Darst:  understood :)
[11:26] <Darst> SilentDis as soon as I get that done I will let you know what happens :)
[11:26] <kittykitty> matt: Application -> Accessories -> Terminal
[11:26] <medic30420> sorry to repost: how do i disable gssapi-with-mic authentication in ssh?
[11:26] <SilentDis> Darst:  okes.  :)
[11:26] <Darst> SilentDis Many thanks for the advice to date
[11:27] <Darst> Many many thanks
[11:27] <kittykitty> still with me matt ?

[11:27] <SilentDis> Darst:  no worries.  i had a drive die on me recently.  had to go through this myself to get as much data as I could (was about 3 days off my weekly backup job running, heh)
[11:27] <pr3d4t0r> Greetings.
[11:27] <pr3d4t0r> wasabi_!
[11:27] <foureight84> i need some help with gnome-session-properties
[11:27] <foureight84> hi pr3d4t0r
[11:28] <matt_____> kittykitty, it wouldn't mount in shell. it would before i edited the fstab
[11:28] <PenguinAttacks> Hello friends
[11:28] <kittykitty> ok can you tell me the error you're getting when you try to mount it manually please
[11:28] <matt_____> ok
[11:28] <[Relic] > strabes,  thanks for all the help, I just couldn't get it mounted before but since it was only a formatting problem once that was done I was pretty well set, I just wanted to double up on my backup on some important files (DVD and HD) before I install a new version
[11:28] <foureight84> when i add beryl-manager to startup programs, it won't save on the list
[11:28] <PenguinAttacks> is there an easy way to reinstall ubuntu without formatting the harddrive/partition?
[11:28] <Darst> SilentDis if the drive reports ok - should I be able to move the necessary data to my USB drive ?
[11:28] <kittykitty> don't copy/paste the whole thing you just need the pertinant data
[11:28] <pr3d4t0r> Q. What is the default runlevel for Ubuntu Edgy running as a server?  I have it as 2, but most servers I dealt with (non-Ubuntu) say 5.  What's the rationale of running the server in basic multi-user mode instead of full?
[11:28] <matt_____> is it sudo mount ......
[11:29] <foureight84> after i close session properties and run it again, it's not there
[11:29] <pr3d4t0r> Q. (part 2), i.e. runlevels 3 or 5?
[11:29] <SilentDis> Darst:  yes, that's an option... i'd recommend checking the drive right quick to see if anything kicked out in it's logs though
[11:29] <strabes> [Relic] : cool glad i could help
[11:29] <medic30420> penguin attacks, use the text based install, should let you skip that section
[11:29] <[Relic] > off to finish my backing up and then get a new version installed, later all  :)
[11:30] <matt_____> how can i manually try to mount it?
[11:30] <PenguinAttacks> Thanks, I'll google it :)
[11:30] <foureight84> anyone?
[11:30] <florides> hello
[11:30] <kittykitty> you can just type in "mount /dev/hdb1"
[11:30] <foureight84> gnome-session-properties won't save changes i make to the startup programs
[11:30] <SilentDis> darst:  i'd personally mount it and sift through logs first, just to see what is going on
[11:31] <Administrator> foureight84, i believe there is a option to save sessions.
[11:31] <kittykitty> if you have it specified in fstab it'll try to mount it
[11:31] <florides> kann i ask you something?
[11:31] <ace> i'm going to reinstall with another file system, maybe xfs and raid don't work so well
[11:31] <foureight84> yea i turn that on but it still doesn't do it
[11:31] <matt_____> how....what do i do?
[11:31] <ace> bye all
[11:31] <Administrator> foureight84, else try checking out the gnome dotfiles
[11:31] <foureight84> which dotfile in particular?
[11:31] <Administrator> foureight84, or, adding a new options
[11:31] <kittykitty> matt: Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
[11:31] <matt_____> ok
[11:31] <florides> does anyone know a tool to data recovery?
[11:32] <Administrator> foureight84, dunno, try grep -r keywork *
[11:32] <kittykitty> wait for it to load, then type in "mount /dev/hdb1"
[11:32] <SilentDis> brb all...
[11:32] <fiveiron> anyone at all using lirc?
[11:32] <bluefox_> ok, has anyone ever heard of an issue with booting the ubuntu installer/live cd and getting an interrupt error wben you click the run /install button?
[11:32] <PenguinAttacks> <33333
[11:32] <foureight84> okay
[11:32] <foureight84> i will be back
[11:32] <bluefox_> my gf's comp is messed up and wont accept ubuntu :(
[11:33] <matt_____> thats weird, at first it told me only root could do it. then i tried again using sudo. but it told me the dir doesn't exist
[11:33] <kittykitty> bluefox_: have you tried booze ? :P
[11:33] <aSherwood> hola peoples
[11:33] <SNowborn> hi
[11:33] <kittykitty> matt: ok thats what i wanted to hear
[11:33] <bluefox_> kittykitty, if only that would work :D
[11:33] <SNowborn> can someone help me setting up a twinview / 2nd monitor?
[11:33] <bluefox_> hrm
[11:33] <bluefox_> how do i ssh into a knoppix machine to take off stuff from the hard drive?
[11:33] <matt_____> so what do i do kitty?
[11:34] <bluefox_> or a machine running an old version of knoppix?
[11:34] <SNowborn> tried some so far by the howto, but still does not work
[11:34] <kittykitty> matt: can you try "mount /dev/hdb1 /home/matt/data"
[11:34] <aSherwood> hey I had a couple of questions... installed ubuntu 6.10 last night and I set up a screensaver on it for 5 minutes, but no matter how long you leave it idle the screensaver doesn't come on... any ideas how I could find out why?
[11:34] <matt_____> sudo it though, right?
[11:35] <matt_____> once again, it "doesn't exist"
[11:35] <SNowborn> just one monitor, when i start another server with gdmflexiserver, just the other screen turns on
[11:35] <kittykitty> ok, "cd /home/matt"
[11:35] <kittykitty> ls and see if your "data" directory is listed
[11:36] <michael> irc.station51.net
[11:36] <matt_____> not sure whats happening, it does nothing
[11:36] <matt_____> sorta
[11:36] <kittykitty> it just pop up a new prompt line?
[11:36] <kittykitty> try ls -la
[11:36] <matt_____> yes
[11:36] <kittykitty> it'll say "total 0" if there are no files
[11:36] <matt_____> i can cd /home
[11:37] <SNowborn> anyone good in xorg.conf? (twinview? :P )
[11:37] <kittykitty> well looks like we found your problem? no /home/matt/data directory ?
[11:37] <djjason> I am having a problem with xrandr. I can rotate the screen...e.g. to the left...but the resolution does not change so the screen becomes useless....any ideas?
[11:37] <matt_____> not sure, i can see it in nautalis
[11:37] <pr3d4t0r> Q. vmlinuz.old -> boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-amd64-generic - that's what I was running from Dapper, vmlinuz -> boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic - that's what it "upgraded" for Edgy.  How can I tell Edgy to install the AMD kernel instead?  Thanks in advance.
[11:38] <kittykitty> you might be being fooled by nautalis, ls while in /home
[11:38] <brucedes> I want to install ubuntu onto an external usb drive, but it won't properly partition it. Installation always crashes at 15% Anyone know what I should do?
[11:38] <l3mr> !tell pr3d4t0r about generic
[11:38] <l3mr> !generic
[11:38] <ubotu> Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[11:38] <matt_____> i did, it showed up MATT, meaning matt is there, but i can't cd /home/matt
[11:39] <pr3d4t0r> l3mr: Thanks.
[11:39] <kittykitty> well these are case sensitive
[11:39] <kittykitty> try "cd /home/MATT"
[11:39] <matt_____> well
[11:39] <aSherwood> would someone have a minute to help me with an install of Edgy?
[11:39] <SilentDis> quick question:  ide drives appear as /dev/hd*, do sata drives appear differently?
[11:39] <matt_____> its not really upercase, i just showed emphasis
[11:39] <kittykitty> oh
[11:40] <cafuego_> SilentDis: Yes, they appear as scsi drives, /dev/sd*
[11:40] <Slart> SilentDis: mine appear as sda1, sda2 etc
[11:40] <SilentDis> thanks cafuego_ :)
[11:40] <pr3d4t0r> l3mr: Interesting.
[11:40] <matt_____> but, you say its case sensative? because data is Data, if i change the fstab, should it work?
[11:40] <Slart> well.. what cafuego said =)
[11:40] <kittykitty> perhaps
[11:40] <SNowborn> aSherwood: what is the prob?
[11:40] <matt_____> because i just did cd /home/matt/Data, and it worked
[11:40] <pr3d4t0r> l3mr: Given that my server has four cores, should I assume that this will use all four if a multi-threaded app hits it?
[11:40] <kittykitty> but can you "cd /home" then "cd matt" ?
[11:40] <aSherwood> set up the screensaver for 5 minutes, but no matter how long you leave it on, it doesn't come on
[11:40] <kittykitty> ok
[11:40] <l3mr> pr3d4t0r: yes, smp is enabled in generic
[11:40] <aSherwood> ps reveals that the screensaver service is running
[11:41] <matt_____> no, just comes up blank
[11:41] <kittykitty> well try "mount /dev/hdb1 /home/matt/Data"
[11:41] <pr3d4t0r> l3mr: Cool - thanks.
[11:41] <aSherwood> so I'm afraid that's the extent of my troubleshooting ability here
[11:41] <kittykitty> if you "pwd" it'll show you your current working directory, if you're not sure if the cd is wrking you can "pwd" before and affter issuing the command to see if it changed
[11:41] <matt_____> it mounted
[11:41] <kittykitty> congrats
[11:42] <kittykitty> so now i must club you with the "SHIFT and CAPS" keys of doom
[11:42] <matt_____> but i want it to automount, if i edit fstab and make it Data, should that do it?
[11:42] <SNowborn> checked all the boxes in the settings screen for screensaver?
[11:42] <kittykitty> it should, if you set it to auto in the fstab
[11:42] <aSherwood> All the ones I know how to check
[11:42] <aSherwood> all the ones in the Screensaver dialog
[11:43] <matt_____> auto?                                             /dev/hdb1       /home/matt/data ext3    defaults        0       0
[11:43] <aSherwood> is there another place to edit screensaver settings?
[11:43] <ryanakca> why doesn't my sudoers file give root access to the pbuilders only to the builders group? http://dpaste.com/3836/
[11:43] <wimpies> matt____ : auto,defaults
[11:43] <kittykitty> :P
[11:43] <matt_____> should defaults be auto?
[11:43] <wimpies> no defaults is not auto
[11:43] <matt_____> i mean, do i TYPE auto,defaults
[11:43] <foureight84> hi again
[11:43] <wimpies> yes you do
[11:44] <kittykitty> you can if you want
[11:44] <matt_____> lol, but will it make it WORK?
[11:44] <foureight84> so gnome-session startups still won't save the modifications i add to it
[11:44] <SNowborn> aSherwood: hm, guess not
[11:44] <wimpies> should
[11:44] <dafan> Gah, after I upgraded beryl my screen lost the window decorations.
[11:44] <SNowborn> was still checking in energy settings, but nth related to scrsaver
[11:44] <dafan> It's worked perfectly fine since hte upgrade.
[11:44] <aSherwood> also there are some menus where settings don't stick
[11:45] <wimpies> btw : does any of you know if I can download previous package versions ?
[11:45] <aSherwood> for instance, when in Nibbles, if I try to turn sound on, close the window, open it again and sound is off..
[11:45] <SNowborn> like where?
[11:45] <foureight84> anyone?
[11:45] <SNowborn> hm, no clue there....
[11:45] <aSherwood> even though the sound works fine throuh XMMS, etc
[11:45] <wimpies> I need to downgrade from 2.6.17.1-10.34 to 2.6.17-10.33
[11:46] <gnomefreak> wimpies: good luck on that. since the kernel version didnt change all you will find is 34 most likely
[11:46] <gnomefreak> wimpies: nvidia issues?
[11:46] <dafan> 
[11:47] <wimpies> gnomefreak : no my snd_hda_intel claims missing symbols
[11:47] <wimpies> nvidia is running fine
[11:47] <kittykitty> did you manually build your alsa drivers?
[11:47] <dafan> 
[11:47] <SNowborn> aSherwood: hm, screen stays all the same?
[11:47] <gnomefreak> thats a first.
[11:47] <DrMushroom> #join
[11:47] <aSherwood> yup
[11:47] <gnomefreak> Sakarias_: please stop with the chars
[11:47] <wimpies> hmm, that is a good question ... could be ...
[11:47] <gnomefreak> ack
[11:47] <gnomefreak> dafan: stop with the chars please
[11:48] <gnomefreak> wimpies: give me a minute i know who to ask but not sure if hes here
[11:48] <gnomefreak> wimpies: hes not on right now but he would know about it
[11:48] <wimpies> gnomefreak : who ?
[11:48] <florides> ho all
[11:49] <florides> you know a data recovery tool?
[11:49] <SNowborn> aSherwood: sorry, not any furtger clue right now
[11:49] <gnomefreak> jdong i found him i just pinged him
[11:49] <aSherwood> s'ok, SNowborn
[11:49] <SNowborn> anyone help on my twinview prob?
[11:49] <aSherwood> I gotta go now to make the LUG meeting tonight... thanks for your help
[11:50] <aSherwood> even if you can't help it's nice to ask a question in a linux support room and not hear "RTFM" over and over again
[11:50] <SNowborn> :D
[11:50] <dooglus> I've uninstalled the 'usplash' package, but I still see the splash when I boot, and my virtual consoles still get corrupted.  how can I disable the boot-time graphics?
[11:50] <aSherwood> anyways bye everyone
[11:50] <christiane> Hello again. Is the pkg "xorg-fglrx-driver" the open source one or the binary from ati?
[11:50] <wimpies> gnomefreak : it looks as if my alsa-base package is available for upgrade so I presume I did not change my alsa\
[11:51] <dooglus> christiane: I believe that's the proprietary driver
[11:51] <kittykitty> dooglus, do you have a boot manager that is using splash ?
[11:51] <Fozzie> silentdis, Evening.  Need that link for the ATI FGLRX installation again.  I had to backpedal a bit when my installation of Beryl didn't work out
[11:51] <dooglus> kittykitty: boot manager?  I use 'grub' if that's what you mean
[11:51] <kittykitty> does your grub.conf include a bootsplash image?
[11:52] <slyboots_> Hi
[11:52] <paranoia16> thank you all for helping me automount my hard drive!!!
[11:52] <kittykitty> if so, try removing it so it loads in text mode
[11:52] <gnomefreak> wimpies: try updating it might help
[11:52] <christiane> (I was a little confused because its name begins with xorg-...) What do I have to install if I want to use the open driver?
[11:52] <Fozzie> SilentDis basically, the Direct Rendering is back at No again, and its reading Mesa Drivers
[11:52] <paranoia16> man, i never had this much free help in windows!!!!!!
[11:52] <dooglus> kittykitty: there's no grub.conf on my disk

[11:52] <gnomefreak> dont hold me to that (im not much of a sound guy)
[11:52] <wimpies> gnomefreak : I did an apt-get update / upgrade but there is nothing available
[11:52] <wimpies> gnomefreak : loading modules is not sound ...
[11:53] <gnomefreak> wimpies: the couple of people i just asked dont know either
[11:53] <kittykitty> it'll be in the /boot/grub/ directory (or your / (root) if you didn't specify a seperate boot partition)
[11:53] <SilentDis> fozzie:  heya :)  what vid card are you running again?
