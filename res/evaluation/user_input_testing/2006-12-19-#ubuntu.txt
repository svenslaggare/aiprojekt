[12:01] <mzanfardino> Denyerec: where does the boot fail?  while in GRUBS?
[12:01] <piggyg1> Shaba1: I missed your message, you donating 15 comps?
[12:01] <Denyerec> Just plugging a monitor into it so I can see
[12:01] <fenerbahche> !opt
[12:01] <Denyerec> I access the server via Putty
[12:01] <ubotu> opt: Options Parsing Tool library. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.19-1 (edgy), package size 73 kB, installed size 260 kB
[12:01] <felixjet> em... i didnt play counter strike in too many years. i know it had a version for linux. still exist? or i need run wine?
[12:01] <Denyerec> So right now it's just "Dead"
[12:01] <killermach> nothlit: ok.. I can get 1024x768x8bit (nasty looking) but no color depth higher, or I end up w/ 640x480
[12:02] <Shaba1> vmware?
[12:02] <DBO> felixjet, a linux client never existed
[12:02] <DBO> felixjet, there is still a linux server of course
[12:02] <piggyg1> Shaba1: vmware is an emulator
[12:02] <piggyg1> Shaba1: you still need to purchase windows if you want to use it on vmware
[12:02] <felixjet> DBO uhm, must be server then,it was years ago
[12:02] <mzanfardino> Shaba1: get familiar with "apt-get" and "apt-cache" if using Ubuntu  (or their graphic equivelents "synaptic"
[12:02] <__mikem> vmware is virtualization. I should know, I have vmware workstation. My brother got me a copy.
[12:03] <fenerbahche> cafuego: /opt/vmware , wont it be under / ? and wont i have still only 19 gb ? sorry for newbie questions
[12:03] <felixjet> then, wine or cedega?
[12:03] <felixjet> which one run it better?
[12:03] <piggyg1> mzanfardino: the most important one is definitely apt-get build essentials
[12:03] <Denyerec> mzanfardino - I can ping it, but I can't ssh in.
[12:03] <zhimsel> If I were to run "dpkg --get-selections" in a chrooted environment (i.e. a mounted filesystem from an install backup), would it grab the selections from the chrooted environment or the local system?
[12:03] <con-man> how do I bring up my volume control panel?
[12:03] <DBO> felixjet, both run the original CS fine I believe
[12:03] <Denyerec> "Connection Refused"
[12:03] <mzanfardino> felixjet: depends. cedega you pay for, wine is free.
[12:03] <__mikem> if you need something windows compatable to run in vmware, try reactOS
[12:03] <ady> denyerec, did u turn on the right bits on the server?
[12:03] <con-man> !volume
[12:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about volume - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:03] <con-man> !sound
[12:03] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[12:03] <Music_Shuffle> con-man, KDE or Gnome?
[12:03] <Denyerec> Now I'm in!??!
[12:03] <Denyerec> *bizarre*
[12:03] <con-man> Music_Shuffle: gnome
[12:03] <mzanfardino> Denyerec: so the server is up, but you can't remote access.  can you log on locally?
[12:04] <Denyerec> This is almost as unpredicable as windows
[12:04] <Shaba1> Well I probably will need something like that in the future
[12:04] <Denyerec> Remote SSH just worked on the 3rd attempt
[12:04] <felixjet> mzanfardino: i have cedega already
[12:04] <Shaba1> right now its just a matter of testing if the machines work
[12:04] <mzanfardino> Denyerec: UE12 (user error #12)
[12:04] <nothlit> killermach, =/ i don't have any experience with this sort of thing, what about 800x600, can you get any better?
[12:04] <Denyerec> hehe
[12:04] <piggyg1> WHAts wrong with WINE?
[12:04] <Shaba1> then installing ubuntu to the hard drive so I have SOME sort of OS
[12:04] <Music_Shuffle> con-man, kmix works for KDE, prolly for Gnome too >.>
[12:04] <zhimsel> Does anyone know if I were to run "dpkg --get-selections" in a chrooted environment (i.e. a mounted filesystem from an install backup), would it grab the selections from the chrooted environment or the local system?
[12:04] <Music_Shuffle> piggyg1, I dunno, 'swrong with WINE?
[12:04] <Shaba1> Then its trying to get them to talk to my win2k server
[12:04] <nothlit> mzanfardino, cedega cvs is free
[12:04] <Music_Shuffle> Goes well with cheese.
[12:05] <__mikem> piggygl, wine is very limited in reliability
[12:05] <mzanfardino> felixjet: I'm using wine to play WoW and it works great.  I was looking into cedega as it is supposed to be optimized for WoW, but I find wine works fine...
[12:05] <mzanfardino> nothlit: thank you.  didn't know that.
[12:05] <zhimsel> I would test it, but I'm pressed for time.
[12:05] <Shaba1> then after that configuring Gnome,KDE or whatever to NOT let users to the desktop unless they are verified and authenticated in AD/
[12:05] <Shaba1> So there is my order of operations
[12:05] <nevron> dbo it didnt work it is strange because the right monitor says synch out of range during the login screen and then when gnome loads magically it displays everything but sends me to clone mode if i run the right screen in 1280 1024 and left in 1024 768 everything works fine i think that this is a bug
[12:06] <felixjet> mzanfardino: ill try wine then :)
[12:06] <killermach> nothlit: I either get 640x480 or 1024x768x8bit  or nothing.. hmm
[12:06] <killermach> nothlit: time to quit for now.. thanks again
[12:06] <mzanfardino> felixjet: if you are wanting to use it for something like WoW, look for the howto: specific to wine and WoW.  I built the latest version of wine and made some configuration changes, and it worked brilliantly
[12:06] <nothlit> killermach, try #linux, they usually know more stuff
[12:07] <mzanfardino> anyone able to give me some more information on .desktop files for gnome?
[12:07] <nothlit> do wow updates in wine with bt work fine too?
[12:07] <DBO> nevron, if you are around in like 5 hours I will fix you up =)
[12:07] <nothlit> mzanfardino, free-desktop.org
[12:07] <nothlit> mzanfardino, its should be based on a standard spec
[12:08] <mzanfardino> nothlit: thanks. I'll check that out
[12:08] <Red-Sox> http://pastebin.ca/284209
[12:08] <fenerbahche> what is /opt for ?
[12:08] <Red-Sox> What's wrong with my card?
[12:08] <johoja> . /opt i think optiiona
[12:09] <mzanfardino> nothlit: as for wow, not sure what bt means
[12:09] <naylor> please if anyone can help me out to fix this: http://pastebin.ca/284160
[12:09] <Music_Shuffle> ./optional would make rational sense.
[12:09] <mzanfardino> nothlit: only just started playing wow... and only just started playing with ubuntu/linux
[12:09] <nothlit>  /opt is for binaries that come with libs and assorted files that can't be neatly sorted into the linux filesystem
[12:09] <nevron> DBO framkly i believe that this cannot be fixed
[12:09] <nothlit> thats the official filesystem reason
[12:09] <nothlit> its just a place to lop programs into really,
[12:10] <nothlit> but they are selfcontained if theyre in there
[12:10] <mzanfardino> naylor: did you apt-get update and apt-get-upgrade first?
[12:10] <tuskernini> TORRENT help... anyone?
[12:10] <DBO> nevron, Im sure it can but we'll see =)  Im a bit busy right now however
[12:10] <nothlit> its sort of like static apps
[12:10] <Red-Sox> oops
[12:10] <Red-Sox> http://pastebin.ca/284209
[12:10] <Red-Sox> gfx card problems
[12:10] <__mikem> Are there any screenshots of the latest version of ubuntu, I am still on dapper drake and don't currently have the time to upgrade.
[12:10] <nevron> ok i will be online in 5 hours
[12:10] <kitche> tuskernini: what's your problem exactly?
[12:10] <ozfrog> hullo - no sound - a Creative SB 16 in a PCI slot. I downloaded GStreamer but still nothing :(
[12:11] <kitche> __mikem: theya re pretty much the same screen shots just updated software
[12:11] <tuskernini> kitche, i made a torrent and uploaded it, how do i know if i am seeding it? on the site it does not show... what do i have to do? it is my first try
[12:11] <skelter> hey all - i'm having some trouble getting wireless to work with my ppc running ubuntu. anyone able to help?
[12:11] <mzanfardino> nothlit: was that free-desktop.org?  I'm getting 404...
[12:11] <kitche> tuskernini: you have to have the torrent open to seed it
[12:12] <nothlit> mzanfardino, lemme check
[12:12] <Red-Sox> nutn?
[12:12] <user123> skelter what's problem
[12:12] <Stormx2> skelter: Card, etc? What is the issue?
[12:12] <nothlit> mzanfardino, sorry, no dash
[12:12] <skelter> the card i have is whatever comes inside a g4 powerbook
[12:12] <mzanfardino> nothlit: heh... just googled it...
[12:12] <skelter> and the problem is, well, i don't know how to get it to work
[12:12] <tuskernini> how 'open' i made the torrent file... do i start it with bttornado and overwrite my original file? cant be?
[12:13] <skelter> 0% signal strength for eth1, though i know there is a perfectly usable signal
[12:13] <user123> skelter i resolve with broadcom chip
[12:13] <skelter> user123: i don't know what that means, i'm afraid
[12:14] <user123> skelter you must keep a pcmcia based broadcom chipset
[12:14] <skelter> it is possible.
[12:14] <naylor> mzanfarding, yes but that doesn't help it, it just says those packages aren't configured
[12:14] <skelter> i can neither confirm nor deny that statement
[12:15] <ozfrog> hullo - no sound - a Creative SB 16 in a PCI slot. I downloaded GStreamer but still nothing :(
[12:15] <crimsun_> ozfrog: err, what's the output from ``asoundconf list && amixer'' ? Please use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:15] <skelter> user123: any tips on what i can do about it?
[12:16] <piggyg1> react_OS page is down
[12:16] <ozfrog> crimsun - Hi 1 sec I will paste as per
[12:16] <piggyg1> but it did sound promising
[12:16] <tuskernini> kitche, how do you mean i need the torrent open?
[12:16] <kitche> tuskernini: you need ot have the torrent open in your torrent client
[12:17] <podr0znik> 'evening guys
[12:17] <podr0znik> (and ladies?)
[12:17] <Stormx2> you're having a laugh :P
[12:17] <Music_Shuffle> Hai.
[12:17] <ozfrog> crimson - no need to paste - absolutely zro output from that command
[12:17] <podr0znik> I installed Ubuntu a couple of days ago
[12:17] <podr0znik> my computer freezes almost (and sometimes completely) when I'm switching between profiles
[12:17] <tuskernini> kitche, ok, thank you... i have not managed to get it with bttornado but i will work on it.
[12:17] <podr0znik> anybody an idea what might be the reason?
[12:17] <crimsun_> ozfrog: from which, the asoundconf?
[12:17] <Stormx2> podr0znik: profiles?
[12:17] <podr0znik> users
[12:18] <ozfrog> crimsun yes
[12:18] <crimsun_> ozfrog: then pastebin ``lspci -v && lspci -nv'', please
[12:18] <Stormx2> podr0znik: Hmm. Firstly, why do you need to switch between users?
[12:18] <skelter> so, for my connection properties for eth1, it says i am disconnected, signal strength 0. what would i normally do to connect to a network that i know the name of?
[12:18] <podr0znik> Stormx2, because we have 2 users here :) that is me and my partner
[12:18] <Stormx2> Ah, I see.
[12:18] <user123> skelter find in google broadcom chipset linux
[12:19] <Stormx2> podr0znik: Well I have no idea why that would happen! Are you using sudo to launch graphical apps?
[12:19] <user123> skelter which device use
[12:19] <tuskernini> kitche, ah ok something seems to work, so i have to open the torrent ad save the file as... my original file... that seems to work
[12:19] <skelter> user123: i don't understand your question
[12:19] <KingAztech> has anyone here used Joomla before and can help me?
[12:19] <podr0znik> Stormx2, no... just the red button on right top of the screen
[12:19] <podr0znik> I must say that my experience with command line is 0,0
[12:20] <Stormx2> podr0znik: Thats okay. Sometimes using sudo incorrectly can do that
[12:20] <user123> what periferic have in your laptop
[12:20] <samalex> hmm, just booted my imac g3 from 5.10, and after logging in it's just sitting at a blank desktop with a mouse curser arrow.  hmmm
[12:20] <user123> for wifi
[12:20] <ozfrog> crimsun pasted ( I hope )
[12:20] <Stormx2> podr0znik: Otherwise I don't know. Perhaps try rebooting, logging in as user #1, then logging in as user #2. See if it crashes then. It could be an app mucking up X or GDM.
[12:21] <skelter> user123: i am using eth1? how would i find out more than that?
[12:21] <Shaba1> Ok what is the boot file for Gnome
[12:21] <Stormx2> Im actually writing christmas cards at the moment so sorry if I seem a little afk.
[12:21] <crimsun_> ozfrog: url?
[12:21] <Shaba1> I.E. the one it loads before anything else
[12:21] <podr0znik> Thanks for the advice Stormx2.
[12:21] <psyber> hey cafuego.... u still here?
[12:21] <un_operateur1> does anyone know why I am unable to properly view some unicode characters in aterm/uxterm -- when i use midnight commander or view manpages, some characters just appear as ??, etc
[12:21] <podr0znik> the only thing that could have affected the system in any way was deleting Gaim
[12:21] <ozfrog> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:21] <podr0znik> 'cause I replaced it with Kopete
[12:21] <ozfrog> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:21] <admin_> How do i restart X from shell?
[12:21] <Stormx2> podr0znik: Ah. Did you just delete it or something?
[12:21] <fenerbahche>  hi i have vmware under /var.  i am gonna create new partition and i will mount /home to the new partitions, i have already two guest os in vmware, what happens if i cut vmware and paste to the new partiton, will it still work ?
[12:22] <user123> from the terminal iwconfig eth1 and say me what you read
[12:22] <podr0znik> "just" deleting was not possible
[12:22] <Shaba1> I will be trying to restrict acess to the desktop
[12:22] <Stormx2> admin_: If your in shell X isn't running, eh?
[12:22] <podr0znik> it said I had to use the Synaptic Package manager
[12:22] <podr0znik> that I did
[12:22] <Stormx2> podr0znik: Good, that was the right thing to do.
[12:22] <ozfrog> paste 37832
[12:22] <admin_> Stormx2: What? I just simply want the commads to resatrt X throguh tty1, or any console
[12:22] <un_operateur1> admin_,  I should think -- /etc/init.d/?dm restart
[12:22] <skelter> broadcom 4306
[12:22] <tsg_> somebody help me out, what's a sound server?
[12:22] <Stormx2> admin_: Ah whatever...
[12:22] <admin_> un_operateur1: ok, thanks
[12:22] <podr0znik> maybe it has to do something with video settings
[12:22] <Aar0n444> Hi
[12:22] <crimsun_> ozfrog: specifically, please. I'm in a meeting.
[12:23] <podr0znik> cause actually it looks like the computer keeps working properly, but my screen remains black
[12:23] <Stormx2> tsg_: A sound server takes all the sound coming from apps, applies whatever settings you have, and outputs it to your sound card (the thing your speakers plug into)
[12:23] <Aar0n444> Would my 700Mhz, 512mb of RAM, 10gb HDD laptop be okay running Ubuntu or should I go for Xubuntu or something more light weight?
[12:23] <tsg_> stormx2: so where would I find one?
[12:23] <podr0znik> it also happens sometimes that my screen is being projected on my monitor in a wrong way, so that I only see a part of it (10 cm to the right, 1 cm down)
[12:23] <admin_> Aar0n444: It would be a tad slow, but I would go with GNOME over XFCE
[12:23] <Stormx2> Aar0n444: Would seem fine to me. If you have issues with speed you can always install xubuntu from ubuntu
[12:23] <kinhoshi> ok, when I restart my pc kubuntu restarted in tty1 and X server is already running but when I try to switch over to KDE with ctrl-alt-f7 nothing is showing :/
[12:23] <bimberi> Aar0n444: should be ok
[12:23] <ozfrog> crimsun http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:24] <n2diy> I have a problem with Mondo, and their guys told me to try the latest version, 2.20, now Update is bugging me to "update" to 2.06, how do I tell Update back off?
[12:24] <Stormx2> Aar0n444: you just need to install xubuntu-desktop from ubuntu ;-)
[12:24] <ozfrog> crimsun http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org /37832
[12:24] <linux_kid> Anyone know how to install Pictosniff on non-BSD systems?
[12:24] <psyber> OK.... im gonna give this 1 more try.... anyone here good with configuring a wireless card?
[12:24] <Stormx2> psyber: Probably. Model?
[12:24] <linux_kid> !wlan
[12:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wlan - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:24] <user123> you must configure etc networkinterfaces
[12:24] <Stormx2> !wireless
[12:24] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:25] <curs0r> has anyone successfully compiled projectM under ubuntu?
[12:25] <psyber> storm how do I find the model.... I cant remember the comand
[12:25] <kinhoshi> anyone know what I need to do to get back to KDE?
[12:25] <Stormx2> kinhoshi: How have you got out of it?
[12:25] <crimsun_> ozfrog: are you -positive- it's an sb 16 pci? It's not enumerated in your pci devices at all.
[12:25] <Shaba1> I.E. the one it loads before anything else
[12:25] <Shaba1> Ok what is the boot file for Gnome
[12:25] <kinhoshi> my pc started in tty1
[12:25] <skelter> user123: broadcom 4306
[12:25] <Shaba1> I.E. the one it loads before anything else
[12:25] <Shaba1> I will be trying to restrict acess to the desktop
[12:25] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Boot file for gnome? GNOME doesn't boot.
[12:25] <ozfrog> crimsun - yes - it's non-appearance is baffling
[12:25] <kinhoshi> and X server is already running

[12:26] <crimsun_> ozfrog: what's the model # on the card?
[12:26] <Stormx2> psyber; have a look in the wifi docs, search the forums for that model.
[12:26] <psyber> I have
[12:26] <psyber> no good
[12:26] <ozfrog> crimsun Soundblaster 16 bit
[12:26] <psyber> I have tried the wrapper

[12:26] <crimsun_> ozfrog: no, the model #, like CTxxxx
[12:26] <kishan> what is tty1
[12:26] <ozfrog> crimsun old as the hills :)
[12:26] <Shaba1> how do I get it to NOT start the desktop until a certain condition happens
[12:27] <curs0r> Shaba1, maybe you're looking for .gnomerc?
[12:27] <ozfrog> crimsun sorry n/A

[12:27] <Shaba1> I have no idea curs0r but I will google/yahoo it.
[12:27] <crimsun_> ozfrog: it should be etched into the dsp or the codec on the card
[12:28] <psyber> hey storm..... already tried that page... no luck
[12:28] <psyber> twice actually
[12:28] <Stormx2> psyber: Oh. What was the issue?

[12:34] <kane77> what is the best text editor (with many features like syntax highlighting auto indenting and stuff...)??
[12:34] <Stormx2> psyber: What errors did dmesg give?

[12:35] <kwahgib> Hi, are there any reasons not to pick the amd64 distribution for an Athlon64 X2 processor, but instead go with the i386 release?
[12:35] <curs0r> houseB, this is ubuntu not slax
[12:35] <Stormx2> psyber: Perhaps reply to the thread?
[12:36] <Stormx2> kane77: I always found gedit perfect for HTML editing.
[12:36] <houseB> curs0r, i thut the reason would be same even in ubunto
[12:36] <curs0r> kwahgib, 32bit is still a little smoothe
[12:36] <Stormx2> kwahgib: yes. some apps are unreliable on 64-Bit
[12:36] <Stormx2> kwahgib: For example, flash and firefox, and I'm sure there are others
[12:36] <user123> skelter http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-185650.html
[12:36] <psyber> egh... I suppose I was hoping to not have to do that
[12:36] <podr0znik> Stormx2, a friend is helping me, he asks if I know how to switch on sshd on my distribution
[12:36] <houseB> there are only 12 ppl in slax channel :(
[12:36] <podr0znik> and I don't know how to do that
[12:36] <n2diy> Anybody here have Mondo working?
[12:36] <podr0znik> maybe you or sb else?
[12:37] <curs0r> houseB, is slax a debian distro?
[12:37] <kane77> Stormx2, yeah... gedit is cool but I still like pspad better... dunno why...
[12:37] <psyber> are you using the ndiswrapper storm?
[12:37] <Stormx2> podr0znik: Do you trust your friend?
[12:37] <podr0znik> yes, I do
[12:37] <Stormx2> kane77: For HTML? I'll check it out.
[12:37] <kwahgib> Stormx2: okay, so it would be better to use i386? :)
[12:37] <podr0znik> I know what it is about
[12:37] <podr0znik> sth like he can login to me
[12:37] <kane77> Stormx2, too bad there is no linux version...
[12:38] <Stormx2> kane77: Oh, haha? Mac? Windows? I use CSE HTML Validator in windows, excellent piece of software.
[12:38] <houseB> curs0r, i have no idea.. am new to linux.. all i know is that it uses rpm installation.. i believe debian uses pckg or something...
[12:38] <Stormx2> houseB: Debian uses aptitude
[12:38] <curs0r> houseB, yeah you might want to ask the Fedora room
[12:38] <naylor> hi can anyone help: http://pastebin.ca/284160  those are the errors i'm getting
[12:38] <Stormx2> And hence, ubuntu does too.
[12:38] <bimberi> podr0znik: installing 'ssh' will install and run the sshd daemon
[12:39] <houseB> yay.. so i can get ubuntu help too!!
[12:39] <Shaba1> is ubuntu a derivative of Debian?
[12:39] <bigbro> podr0znik: sudo apt-get install openssh    - is what you want, I think.
[12:39] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Yeah, sort of.
[12:39] <bimberi> !debian
[12:39] <ubotu> Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship
[12:39] <kwahgib> Stormx2: But can't you just use 32bit flash/firefox on amd64?
[12:39] <houseB> ok.. how can i show u the error.. i got it as .txt log file ..
[12:39] <podr0znik> bigbro, ok... and where do I find this ssh?
[12:39] <curs0r> kwahgib, you would thik so
[12:39] <podr0znik> oh
[12:39] <kane77> Stormx2, is quanta good? i look at the specs and scrshots and it seems to be good
[12:39] <podr0znik> sorry :)
[12:40] <curs0r> has anyone successfully compiled projectM under ubuntu?
[12:40] <Stormx2> naylor: Looks like apt was interupted when first installing that package
[12:40] <bimberi> !installing | podr0znik
[12:40] <ubotu> podr0znik: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[12:40] <cius> would anyone happen to know what changed regarding ALSA from Dapper to Edgy?  Edgy doesn't play right with my surround sound, while Dapper handled it fine.
[12:40] <bimberi> podr0znik: argh, sorry that was the wrong factoid
[12:40] <Stormx2> naylor: I'd try to completely remove it using apt, then reinstall. I think its like remove --purge
[12:40] <Stormx2> but I can't remember, check the man
[12:40] <naylor> Stormx2, i've tried reinstalling the problem packages and that won't work
[12:40] <kwahgib> curs0r: but practice is different?
[12:41] <Stormx2> kane77; quanta? never heard of it xD
[12:41] <naylor> Stormx2, i tried removing them in synaptic but when i press to remove it wants to take loads of package
[12:41] <naylor> off my machine
[12:41] <bimberi> podr0znik: run synaptic (System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager), search for and install ssh
[12:41] <podr0znik> thanks anyways bimberi :)
[12:41] <podr0znik> ok
[12:41] <podr0znik> cool
[12:41] <curs0r> kwahgib, the geniuses at macrodobe have truly made a 64bit incompatible app
[12:41] <Stormx2> naylor: Hmm. Hold on
[12:41] <naylor> Stormx2, it wanted to remove stuff like ubuntu-desktop etc
[12:41] <superkirbyartist> Any MIDI software for Ubuntu?
[12:41] <bigbro> podr0znik: Run the command I gave you - that's it.
[12:42] <superkirbyartist> Any MIDI software for Ubuntu, please?
[12:42] <PriceChild> superkirbyartist, what kind of midi software?
[12:42] <kwahgib> curs0r: but 32bit flash would work inside 32bit firefox on 64bit ubuntu? :)
[12:42] <PriceChild> superkirbyartist, what do you want to do?
[12:42] <bigbro> podr0znik: APologies - sudo apt-get install openssh-server    is probably what you want.
[12:42] <superkirbyartist> PriceChild: I have a piano connected to this iMac.
[12:42] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: Yes - loads - what do you want to do.
[12:42] <curs0r> kwahgib, yes, but that may e much harder than it sounds
[12:43] <podr0znik> bigbro: I think the same is done right now from Synaptic Package Manager
[12:43] <podr0znik> right, bimberi ?
[12:43] <PriceChild> superkirbyartist, i've got no experience there, but hopefully that will help someone else giv eyou an answer
[12:43] <curs0r> kwahgib, in gentoo to get it to work i had to create a 32bitchroot
[12:43] <bimberi> bigbro, podr0znik: yes, openssh-server is a dependency of ssh so will be installed at the same time
[12:43] <khaladan> what are some cpu benchmarks i can download?
[12:43] <houseB> ok here's my paste: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37836/
[12:43] <superkirbyartist> Midi recording, editing, like FL Studio.
[12:43] <podr0znik> ok, thanks all
[12:43] <bigbro> podr0znik: synaptic is a thin wrapper around apt, AIUI.
[12:43] <kwahgib> curs0r: ah that sucks
[12:43] <houseB> its the log of my effort installing my wireless card
[12:44] <kwahgib> curs0r: well, no flash is a no go, i guess
[12:44] <superkirbyartist> bigbro: software?
[12:44] <kwahgib> curs0r: sadly it has become so essential on the web
[12:44] <curs0r> kwahgib, too true
[12:44] <superkirbyartist> BigBro?
[12:44] <Stormx2> naylor: Hold on. Try this: "sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get --reinstall install <package>"
[12:44] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: Is that scoring or sequencing?
[12:45] <kwahgib> curs0r: let me ask it the other way around, any significant advantages on taking amd64 version of ubuntu on a amd64 processor?
[12:45] <PriceChild> kwahgib, yeah - performance
[12:45] <kwahgib> curs0r: i dont have insane amounts of memory, so i dont care for hte larger address size
[12:45] <superkirbyartist> Think sequencing, but I want to record from piano and export to MIDI.
[12:45] <kwahgib> pricechild: shouldn't that be negliglable?
[12:45] <PriceChild> kwahgib, not at all :)
[12:45] <curs0r> kwahgib, for now there really isn't any benefit to 64bit unless you're crunching huge data
[12:46] <kwahgib> pricechild: what performance gains should there be then?
[12:46] <naylor> Stormx2, http://pastebin.ca/284257
[12:46] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: Check out http://linux-sound.org/  - take your pick. I use Audacity for small editing jobs, and Ardour for multi-track recording.
[12:46] <PriceChild> I have no numbers specifically kwahgib
[12:46] <kwahgib> curs0r: okay
[12:46] <superkirbyartist> Audacity doesn't do MIDI :(
[12:47] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: Audacity does.
[12:47] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: I've used Rosegarden a bit for scoring. I'm pretty sure it can do sequencing as well, though I've not tried.
[12:47] <curs0r> hahaha an encoder from DTS costs $1100, creative has a DTS converter that could be used the same way for $100 hahaha
[12:48] <__mikem> Does anyone know if beryl can run in vmware?
[12:48] <user123>  superkirbyartist: use rosegarden
[12:48] <Riyonuk> Is it possible to install ubuntu or any OS on a usb? I have a 1gig one
[12:48] <PriceChild> __mikem, not afaik... for compositing you normally need direct access to the GPU
[12:48] <Stormx2> naylor: Bleh, I have no idea. Ask on the forums :)
[12:48] <bigbro> curs0r: Yeah - creative are well known for making stuff that sounds almost good, but not quite.
[12:48] <superkirbyartist> Rosegarden is also considered a sequencer, according to site.,
[12:48] <kane77> is it possible to get scanner working?
[12:48] <superkirbyartist> I'm not sure what that means.
[12:48] <Stormx2> Riyonuk: Think so.

[12:48] <superkirbyartist> But it looks like FL Studio.
[12:48] <Stormx2> It may also be on ubuntuforums.org
[12:48] <PriceChild> __mikem, vm gets in the way
[12:49] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: Fair enough - give it a go and see what you think :-)  I'm more an audio person than MIDI, tbh. I use MIDI for control rather than sequencing.
[12:49] <superkirbyartist> Can I go to add/remove?
[12:49] <curs0r> bigbro it's a digital encoder, there's no sound to it
[12:49] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: FL == Fruity Loops ?
[12:49] <naylor> Stormx2, cool ok i'll post on forums, no one in here tonight seems to know how to help
[12:49] <superkirbyartist> bigbro: yes, but now it's FL studio, and one of the versions are fruityloops.

[12:49] <bigbro> superkirbyartist: Fair enough :)
[12:49] <bigbro> curs0r: ???
[12:50] <superkirbyartist> Yay  rosegarden in easy add/remove!
[12:50] <curs0r> bigbro, it doesn't play audio, it just muxes analog channels
[12:50] <bigbro> curs0r: Yes - it deals with audio. That affects the sound.
[12:50] <bigbro> curs0r: And the encoders/decoders do a lot more than just MUX channels of audio.
[12:51] <Riddla> does anyone know how to make edgy 6.10 i386 stop changing the console font upon boot? iv fbcon:font=XXXX 'd and it all works good but when one of the init.d scripts kicks in the console font is changed by edgy... any ideas?
[12:51] <superkirbyartist> This iMac is sick, except for monitor color issues :-(
[12:51] <curs0r> bigbro, yeah ok don't read up on it first or anything
[12:52] <bigbro> curs0r: Read up on what? DTS encoders? :-)
[12:52] <xcbxbxcv> Anyone know how to set up dhcpd to hand out a metric value for a default route?
[12:52] <Arigato> what is the default font resolution?
[12:52] <Riddla> 8x16 i think
[12:52] <nevron> what is the command for reinstalling an application
[12:53] <Riyonuk> So I have to have a USB hard disk? Will my normal usb work?
[12:53] <jrib> nevron: why?  that usually doesn't resolve anything, but it is 'sudo aptitude reinstall package_name'
[12:54] <nevron> because my beryl installation is partial
[12:54] <skelter> user123: thank you :)
[12:54] <bigbro> nevron: What jrib said. What appears to be the problem? Perhaps a dpkg --reconfigure <packagename>  might be more like what you're looking for?

[01:13] <TommyBJ> This is done via bios/cmos setup

[01:14] <SilentDis> curs0r:  same here.  i mean, sure, it's one of the first things I install... but still...
[01:14] <Billy> no it does not i went to bios and tried to load from there
[01:14] <neuratix> PriceChild: now i found beryl :) thank you!
[01:14] <curs0r> SilentDis, is that just graphics drvers or are they including chipset drvers too?
[01:14] <SilentDis> curs0r:  I'd almost rather see a push to get the OSS drivers up to spec for beryl/compiz use
[01:15] <Billy> will try again ill be back if i cant get it thank you
[01:15] <Aar0n444> sure :-)
[01:15] <SilentDis> curs0r:  no idea yet... last I looked at the planning doc, it was listed as 'pending'
=== auk__ is now known as auk
[01:15] <neuratix> !beryl
[01:15] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[01:16] <ThePub> Anyone ever have issues playing videos on the NYTimes Web site?  Flash stuff from everywhere else works, just NYTimes that seems to ahve an issue :(
[01:16] <curs0r> SilentDis, the way supposed "nvidia" audio chips work with nvidia's own drivers that thought scares me
[01:16] <PriceChild> neuratix, no problem :)
[01:16] <jvai> hey ppl...
[01:17] <SilentDis> !hi | jvai
[01:17] <ubotu> jvai: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[01:17] <dax_> how can I upgrade from breezy to dapper drake...
[01:17] <jvai> thnk u ubotu
[01:17] <SilentDis> !upgrade | dax_
[01:17] <ubotu> dax_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:17] <goldbond> what is the best way to back up an encrypted directory?
[01:18] <un_operateur1> dax_, you might want to upgrade straight to the newest -- edgy :)
[01:18] <goldbond> i am trying to use encfs and rsync, but it is not going well
[01:18] <SilentDis> un_operateur1:  can't 'upgrade' that way, gatta do a clean install
[01:18] <un_operateur1> SilenceGold, you can't upgrade from breezy to edgy?? via a dist-upgrade???
[01:19] <un_operateur1> SilentDis** sorry
[01:19] <saxin> Can you suggest any books where I can learn programming under Ubuntu?
[01:19] <jrib> saxin: what language?
[01:19] <un_operateur1> saxin, what kind of programming?
[01:19] <goldbond> shell programmin?
[01:19] <SilentDis> un_operateur1:  that's right.  gatta step 1 by 1 for an 'upgrade' path.  so, it would be Breezy > Dapper > Edgy
[01:19] <saxin> I don't know which language to start with
[01:20] <un_operateur1> SilentDis, errm, i bet you if you just updated sources.list with edgy repos -- a dist-upgrade is possible
[01:20] <Ignite_> I'm trying to type non-english characters, such as those found in Spanish, e.g. in the word maana, but I can't, usually it would be a simple usage of the alt-gr key but I'm having no luck. I have a standard 104 key keyboard, any help would be great. :-)
[01:20] <jrib> saxin: I would recommend python, check out docs.python.org tutorial as well as diveintopython.org
[01:20] <curs0r> un_operateur1, you still awake? haha
[01:20] <un_operateur1> saxin, well, you have to decide what exactly you want to program -- applications, utilities, drivers, databases, web-apps, what??
[01:20] <Blippe> which file got the keymap which loads at startup? in dapper it was /etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz, but i have no luck finding the right one in edgy.
[01:20] <SilentDis> un_operateur1:  really.  I was under the impression that it was only possible to perform in-place upgrades by following the path... at least all the docs note that.
[01:20] <un_operateur1> curs0r, I woke up some 3-4 hours ago :)
[01:21] <Edulix> any ubuntu oficial packages for ooo 2.1 ?
[01:21] <saxin> jrib: thanks for the advise, but why do you mean I should choose THAT language?
[01:21] <SilentDis> Edulix:  might check backports...
[01:21] <Red-Sox> In gnome, how do you make it so pannels are always behind other windows?
[01:21] <jrib> saxin: because it's my favorite and really easy to learn the basics :)
[01:21] <SilentDis> !backports | edulix
[01:21] <ubotu> edulix: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[01:21] <saxin> un_operateur1: applications I guess.
[01:21] <un_operateur1> SilentDis, I dont think so -- it doesnt make sense to have that restriction in place if most of the dapper packages are going to be replaced anyway
[01:21] <TommyBJ> saxin: First of all you need to decide what code to write... bein webapps, gui, shellscripts, drivers etc.
[01:21] <curs0r> this window is stealing my life, but i'm learning so much
[01:21] <TommyBJ> saxin: If applications, the python is quite nice
[01:21] <Ignite_> Edulix, not yet, but if you remove the official ones from your system then use alien to convert OOo's RPMs to debs and install those you'll be good to go. :)
[01:21] <jvai> red-sox, u can autohide the panels
[01:22] <un_operateur1> saxin, python and ruby are good languages for that
[01:22] <Billy> ok im back wont boot from disk
[01:22] <SilentDis> un_operateur1:  dapper is a bit of an oddity... what with it's LTS status and all
[01:22] <Edulix> SilentDis: I already have backports in my reps
[01:22] <saxin> I have heard alot of nice things said about perl.. but I guess that is more for web, is that correct?
[01:22] <un_operateur1> SilentDis, LTS is just the support canonical gives to the customers who purchase that option, AFAIK
[01:22] <Edulix> Ignite_: ok
[01:22] <curs0r> saxin, perl is slow
[01:22] <Red-Sox> jvai: No, because when the windows maximize I want for them to not maximize over the panel
[01:23] <un_operateur1> saxin, perl is great -- it's just a steeper learning curve for apps because it doesnt natively support GUIs
[01:23] <TommyBJ> saxin: perl is very nice.. I'm a perl man myself... but the GUI programming is not that good
[01:23] <Lunar_Lamp> <saxin> I have heard alot of nice things said about perl.. but I guess that is more for web, is that correct? <== there are many who would say bad things about perl purely as it's hard to read.
[01:23] <jvai> ooo
[01:23] <Red-Sox> jvai: But I want the window order to be behind other windows
[01:23] <SilentDis> un_operateur1:  that's true, but it's also a 'bugfix' point.  there'll be bugfixes pushed out for 3 years for dapper.
[01:23] <Lunar_Lamp> SilenceGold, it's 5years for the server iirc.
[01:23] <curs0r> jit compiling rules
[01:23] <Lunar_Lamp> er, SilentDis
[01:23] <un_operateur1> curs0r, perl isnt slow -- its as fast as python or ruby .. but perl/gtk vs python/gtk is a no-comp .. python outdoes perl there
[01:23] <TommyBJ> Is Feisty going to be a LTS?
[01:24] <SilentDis> lunar_lamp:  ahh... i was talking desktop, as that's what I so far have experience with :)
[01:24] <hhthunderbird_> needing hlp to configure sound card (sb live ct4760)
[01:24] <un_operateur1> TommyBJ, I suppose there will be a LTS candidate for feisty too
[01:24] <SilentDis> TommyBJ:  no, it'll be a normal release.
[01:24] <saxin> You see.. i got a friend doing alot of perl, and therefor it will bee easy for me to get started and get help :)
[01:24] <TommyBJ> ok
[01:24] <IndyGUnFreak> Whats LTS?
[01:24] <Red-Sox> Guess thats a no
[01:24] <TommyBJ> saxin: perl is never easy ;)
[01:24] <Ignite_> Long Term Support IndyGUnFreak
[01:24] <TommyBJ> IndyGUnFreak: Long time/term support
[01:24] <IndyGUnFreak> lol, duh.., so simple, yet so brilliant...lol
[01:24] <curs0r> un_operateur1, i have no room to be critical about languages that are slow or use a lot of memory, i dev in mono because i'm lazy lol
[01:24] <saxin> TommyBJ: easier, sorry :P
[01:25] <IndyGUnFreak> now Dapper is LTS, right?
[01:25] <TommyBJ> Has anyone here any experience with ruby/gtk?
[01:25] <TommyBJ> IndyGUnFreak: correct
[01:25] <un_operateur1> saxin, well, I'm a perl person -- but i dont recommend it to start programming GUI applications -- you probably will learn GUI programming quicker with python
[01:25] <Ignite_> TommyBJ, I do.
[01:25] <SilentDis> I don't program.  I script.  Starting to teach myself ruby now, i'm fairly well-versed in PHP though :)
[01:25] <IndyGUnFreak> so what exactly does that mean?
[01:25] <cafuego> un_operateur1: Probably not.
[01:25] <TommyBJ> Ignite_: Is it nice? :p
[01:25] <IndyGUnFreak> Ubuntu is gonna support Dapper for longer than it does Edgy?
[01:25] <Ignite_> TommyBJ, it is. :D
[01:26] <Ignite_> <3 Ruby
[01:26] <un_operateur1> saxin, on the other hand -- if you learn perl well, developing in perl is much quicker
[01:26] <hhthunderbird> needing hlp to configure sound card (sb live ct4760)...
[01:26] <cafuego> But perl is evil.
[01:26] <saxin> un_operateur1: OK, I guess that is good for me. I like to see the progress :)
[01:26] <saxin> hehe
[01:26] <Ignite_> I don't like perl personally... never really did.
[01:26] <IndyGUnFreak> what is perl?
[01:26] <dabaR> it is beatiful, I think
[01:26] <curs0r> !perl
[01:26] <ubotu> perl: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language. In component main, is important. Version 5.8.8-6 (edgy), package size 3287 kB, installed size 11436 kB
[01:26] <TommyBJ> IndyGUnFreak: a sexy programming language
[01:26] <Ignite_> IndyGUnFreak, an interpreted programming/scripting language
[01:26] <SilentDis> IndyGUnFreak:  yes.  normal releases are supported with bugfixes and such for 18 months.  Dapper, with it's LTS status, gets bugfixes for 3 years, 5 years on servers.
[01:27] <un_operateur1> Perl is not meant to be loved -- just as you dont get to love your sledge-hammer or chain-saw :)
[01:27] <jvai> idle's in the repos for python... it uses python shell
[01:27] <cafuego> un_operateur1: I *love* much chain saw, thanks :-P
[01:27] <cafuego> s/much/my/
[01:27] <IndyGUnFreak> SilentDis: I didn't know that.. thanks for the info.
[01:27] <n2diy> I have a problem with Mondo, and their guys told me to try the latest version, 2.20, now Update is bugging me to "update" to 2.06, how do I tell Update back off?
[01:27] <dabaR> IndyGUnFreak: it is a swiss army chainsaw
[01:27] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[01:27] <cafuego> un_operateur1: I saw some perl code during a presentation by damnian conway 2 weeks ago...
[01:27] <TommyBJ> hehe
[01:27] <un_operateur1> cafuego, I love conway -- he's way beyond most other perl maestros
[01:28] <cafuego> un_operateur1: code isn't supposed to like like @chomp(_$;;%$!%&%&&(Q^*%&%!%^&%!&$#%&%&;;%^@!#&$);
[01:28] <TommyBJ> cafuego: it's a matter of taste I belive
[01:28] <cafuego> and be a full implentation of decss
[01:28] <un_operateur1> cafuego, except it isnt :) you just over dramatise it there :p
[01:28] <cafuego> un_operateur1: i used a slightly different set of random characters ;-)
[01:28] <SilentDis> feh, just go for the gold.  program entirely in assembly!  :D  lol
[01:28] <dabaR> in machine language
[01:29] <Red-Sox> what's the command to download something
[01:29] <TommyBJ> Why not bring up the debugger and do it all in binary?
[01:29] <un_operateur1> cafuego, the argument that perl is unweildly is a no-comp -- shell scripts are ugly as hell -- so i C -- and ruby (sometimes)
[01:29] <LjL> !offtopic
[01:29] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[01:29] <Red-Sox> curl [url2]  -o openSUSE-10.2-GM-DVD-i386.iso ?
[01:29] <SilentDis> Red-Sox:  what do you want to download?
[01:29] <poppyer> hi, anybody using madwifi in edgy?
[01:29] <dabaR> Red-Sox: you can use wget
[01:29] <Red-Sox> SilentDis: SuSE
[01:29] <cafuego> un_operateur1: Certainly, but it's not considered an art to write ugly-ass C <heh>
[01:29] <Red-Sox> dabaR: k
[01:29] <LjL> cafuego: ... ? what about the obfuscated c code contest?
[01:29] <un_operateur1> cafuego, never heard of the annual C obfu contest??
[01:29] <neuratix_> hmm, i'm kinda missing windowborders while using beryl
[01:29] <SilentDis> Red-Sox:  you'll probably have to download their distro on CD.  check their homepage :)
[01:30] <n2diy> Red-Sox, take a look at synaptic, in system/admin.
[01:30] <cafuego> un_operateur1: Yes, that's a special competition. Not standard syntax.
[01:30] <un_operateur1> cafuego, well, the same goes to perl -- its not considered good practice to write unreadable perl -- i mean why would you??
[01:30] <jorunn> does somenone knows how to change de backgroundcolor or image for the menus at the menubar ("Applications", "places,"....) ???
[01:30] <LjL> cafuego: well, which only goes to say it *is* considered an art, considering there's even a highly held competition on it :)
[01:30] <budward> all I want for xmas is better font rendering in X11 :(
[01:31] <SilentDis> neuratix_:  you should be able to restart the window manager from the beryl-manager icon in the bar, and they should come back.  if not, check out #beryl for more help :)
[01:31] <bruenig> budward, it is open source, go ahed
[01:31] <bruenig> s/ahed/ahead
[01:31] <cafuego> budward: okay, come back next week ;-)
[01:31] <un_operateur1> cafuego, OTOH -- the option to write perl anyway you please is always present -- and that makes it usable to a wider audience with different mindsets and problem solving inclinations
[01:31] <kingace> when booting edgy install cd, i get "Kernel Panic - Not Syncing: Attempted To Kill Init"
[01:31] <usr_rob> parano program for .sfv, .md5 and more are very nice ;)
[01:31] <budward> even if I was a top programmer, I wouldn't touch the x11 source.
[01:31] <Ignite_> budward, System -> Prefs -> Font
[01:31] <kingace> help?
[01:31] <mnoir> un_operateur1: in other words, unacceptable for any production shop
[01:31] <budward> well maybe I would, I would completely re-write it.
[01:32] <dabaR> you programmed top?
[01:32] <SilentDis> kingace:  every time you try to boot the liveCD you get a kernel panic?
[01:32] <Ignite_> Lol dabaR
[01:32] <budward> Ignite_ clear the smoke out between your ears.
[01:32] <kingace> just with my brothers laptop
[01:32] <jorunn> does somenone knows how to change de backgroundcolor or image for the menus at the menubar ("Applications", "places,"....) ???
[01:32] <budward> top as in, "One of the most skilled".
[01:32] <un_operateur1> mnoir, it goes with any languages-- illegibility is not an option -- it takes some upkeep to write good, clean and maintainable code in any language
[01:32] <engla> now this is stupid. The system tells me I need to restart, but only gdm needs to be restarted after the security update. Can't we be smart about it and just restart gdm? it's faster for the user too
[01:32] <dabaR> !info top
[01:32] <ubotu> Package top does not exist in any distro I know
[01:33] <budward> jorunn, try 'panel properties'
[01:33] <SilentDis> kingace: first off, that's VERY impressive.  lol.  second:  i'd check to make sure first that the cd isn't bad, a redownload/reburn might be in order.  second, make sure the laptop is capable of running the liveCD.  what are the specs on that machine?
[01:33] <dabaR> engla: did you get a new kernel?
[01:33] <rb_laptop> engla, you probably picked up a new kernel
[01:33] <mnoir> un_operateur1: the openness of perl makes it much easier to abuse, hence my opinion
[01:33] <Clarrisa_2008> I need help configuring courier-imap on my ubuntu lamp server
[01:33] <budward> ubotu, uh .. 'top' has been around *nix for many years!
[01:33] <un_operateur1> mnoir, just as you speak english -- english is spoken quite lackadaisically on a street-level -- but requires eloquence and pedanticity when used in academia and the sort
[01:33] <dabaR> budward: he is a bot; it is not a package
[01:33] <kingace> silentdis: its a medion.. 2.6 ghz intel p4, nvidia geforce mobile graphic
[01:34] <SilentDis> kingace:  how much ram?
[01:34] <kingace> 512
[01:34] <budward> it's a packacke according to synaptic.
[01:34] <mnoir> un_operateur1: immaterial - i do not program in english
[01:34] <arrenlex> budward: What did ubotu everdo to you?! :(
[01:34] <cafuego> un_operateur1: I don't dispute that perl can be highly useful and is extrmely powerful. For me though, it's too much of a dog's breakfast to be able to do much with (I mainly used perl as a oneliner replacement for sed)
[01:34] <SilentDis> kingace:  first glance shows it SHOULD run... i'd try reburning the LiveCD first.
[01:34] <budward> he molested me when I was in teh shower this morning.
[01:34] <un_operateur1> mnoir, well, some people see that as a bad thing -- i see it as a good thing -- the whole DWIMness (do what i mean) is a good thing, different people have different approaches to problem solving and code writing
[01:34] <Ignite_> mnoir, what language do you speak? Maybe you can help me...
[01:34] <budward> s/teh/the
[01:35] <kingace> silentdis: aight
[01:35] <arrenlex> budward: Lies! Ubotu would never do such a thing. He is the pinnacle of forthrightness and responsibility.
[01:35] <un_operateur1> mnoir, it was an analogy -- no one programs computer applications in english -- but scripts (for dramas) are written in english :)
[01:35] <mnoir> Ignite_: huh? depends on the task, just never perl if it is meant for production
[01:35] <dabaR> he is a little kinky, though.
[01:35] <budward> Seriously, why do most programmers completely suck at gfx design? I mean, there is a lot more that can enhance someone's coding abilities than just the language itself. Like mastering the piano or chess.
[01:36] <un_operateur1> cafuego, it's down to choice -- you either like perl or you dont -- just as VB programmers just hate the smell of C
[01:36] <Blippe> Where do i change the default keymap for the console?
[01:36] <budward> mmmm.. pinnacle.
[01:36] <Ignite_> mnoir, I meant what language do you write comments and human text in, which is what I presumed you meant when you said you don't program in English.
[01:36] <Jeruvy> budward: suck as in your previous comment about ubotu?
[01:36] <wilburpf> Hi everyone, I am currently running an up-to-date Dapper and am having problems with Xen.  It appears that there no longer is a udevsend in /sbin ... is there a new equivalent?
[01:36] <LjL> !offtopic
[01:36] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[01:36] <mnoir> un_operateur1: my point is that analogies using any natural language are not valid in a programming millieu
[01:36] <n2diy> Blippe, system/prefrences/keyboard
[01:36] <budward> Jeruvy you are not well versed in teh english vernacular I can see.
[01:37] <Blippe> n2diy, thanx for the tip, problem is, i said console as in tty(1-6) not gnome
[01:37] <un_operateur1> mnoir, my argument is that perl tries to be a natural language with DWIM
[01:37] <Jeruvy> budward: and you have no brains or talent.
[01:37] <budward> right right.. anyway.
[01:37] <n2diy> Blippe, if you can change it in X it should stick for the consoles too.
[01:38] <wilburpf> Does anyone know if there is a new command to replace the lack of udevsend in /sbin?
[01:38] <Ignite_> un_operateur1, you don't get much more natural than Ruby. And that's all I'm saying on that for now lol. :)
[01:38] <mnoir> un_operateur1: that might explain why it is so hard to support in a production (ie, nontrivial) environment
[01:38] <Blippe> n2diy, so, how do i do it if i don't have X?
[01:38] <budward> more natural than Ruby? What does that mean, "Natural".
[01:38] <elkbuntu> if this talk isnt about seeking answers for support questions, you should move it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:39] <budward> s/\./\?/
[01:39] <mnoir> at 3 in the morning, I do not want to have to figure out which of 18 way was used this time
[01:39] <Ignite_> budward, natural to type, feels natural, comfortable.
[01:39] <mamalove> hi guys sorry 2 bother y'all, but can anybody tell me why it is everytime i try 2 install ubuntu edgy on my machine it keeps crashing?
[01:39] <n2diy> Blippe, heck if I know. :)
[01:39] <wilburpf> what happens, mamalove?
[01:39] <budward> Ignite_ I think Ruby is a weak language personally.
[01:39] <Ignite_> budward, what makes you think that?
[01:39] <Winter> i <3 Ruby
[01:39] <budward> But everyone has there own opinion about what is best.
[01:39] <LjL> could we move the discussion about programming languages to #ubuntu-offtopic please?
[01:39] <un_operateur1> mnoir, I know quite a few projects where perl is used as the main engine -- even where perl cannot go -- C and Java are embedded in perl applications
[01:39] <SilentDis> mamalove:  no bother at all.  what happens when the liveCD boots?  an error?  hangs during boot?
[01:39] <budward> Ignite_ I prefer the 'Naturalness' of python.
[01:40] <Ignite_> Sorry LjL
[01:40] <un_operateur1> I dont like the way ruby treats 0 as TRUE
[01:40] <Winter> heh
[01:40] <LjL> well, it's gone one for a bit now, perhaps it's time to give way to ubuntu support
[01:40] <mnoir> LjL: :)
[01:40] <wilburpf> anyone: what has udevsend changed to?  it is no longer in /sbin, and i can't get Xen working on Dapper, apparently because of it
[01:40] <mamalove> it will start the installation process...user name, password, timezone etc... then the whole system will just seize up - can't ctrl-alt-delete or anything
[01:40] <dabaR> I would like to point out that a good builder uses many tools
[01:40] <mamalove> have to hard reboot the machine
[01:40] <budward> Ignite_ I am nota big fan of end'ing my function blocks or symbols, in fact most of the ruby language .. but more so the lack of modules support like python has.
[01:41] <mamalove> this has happened with 3 ubuntu dvds
[01:41] <Blippe> n2diy, and fyi it doesn't change in tty1 if you change it in preferences - keyboard
[01:41] <SilentDis> wilburpf:  I'm not familiar with xen, so I'm gonna poke ubotu about it... might be some more info/chatrooms that'll help more...
[01:41] <SilentDis> !xen
[01:41] <ubotu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy
[01:41] <budward> Besides, if I am going to code an agile web app, I would use TurboGears of RoR any day
[01:41] <Ignite_> budward, maybe you should read the Ruby docs, learn some more of the syntax and consider saying that again. :P
[01:41] <mnoir> mamalove: memtest works ok?
[01:41] <Ignite_> budward, #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:41] <Ignite_> :)
[01:41] <mamalove> yep - memtest works fine
[01:41] <wilburpf> Silent: thanks
[01:41] <mnoir> hmm
[01:42] <mnoir> and live works?
[01:42] <budward> I coded a 'blog' app in Turbogears in less than 4 hours.
[01:42] <n2diy> Blippe, roger, I set up my Dvorak board at install, and never played around with other layouts.
[01:42] <mamalove> dvds don't appear to be defective - but we have an nvidia card... could that be a problem?
[01:42] <elkbuntu> budward, you've been asked several times to go to #ubuntu-offtopic for the programming language discussion
[01:42] <mnoir> i dunno - 6.06 or 6.10?
[01:42] <mamalove> even live copy stalls/freezes
[01:42] <TheresaLinx> hey
[01:42] <XiXaQ> How can I use the Ubuntu logo in my own enterprise?
[01:43] <kingace> SilentDis: same thing with second burn...
[01:43] <kingace> trying xubuntu
[01:43] <TheresaLinx> cam anyone help me with the installation of Amsn on Ubunto?
[01:43] <budward> elkbuntu, relax, I finished my sentence, This monitor is on the side of me so I am missing a lot of what is being said.
[01:43] <dabaR> XiXaQ: you could try asking on #ubuntu-marketing
[01:43] <mamalove> ubuntu edgy 6.10 (2 copies) & kubuntu 6.10 (dvd)
[01:43] <XiXaQ> TheresaLinx, the installation?
[01:43] <TheresaLinx> yap
[01:43] <XiXaQ> dabaR, that's a great advise. Thanks. :)
[01:43] <dabaR> !synaptic > TheresaLinx
[01:43] <n2diy> Blippe, "locate keyboard" lists a ton of stuff, maybe you can find what you need that way?

[01:45] <mamalove> @elkbuntu
[01:45] <TheresaLinx> yap
[01:45] <LjL> budward, actually, i mentioned it several times, though it was never addressed at you specifically. no need to argue about that anyway now
[01:45] <elkbuntu> mamalove, with cd or dvd?
[01:45] <TheresaLinx> mine is in portguuse thoo xD
[01:46] <n2diy> I have a problem with Mondo, and their guys told me to try the latest version, 2.20, now Update is bugging me to "update" to 2.06, how do I tell Update back off?
[01:46] <jrib> TheresaLinx: if you ahve enabled the universe repository, you can install amsn using synaptic
[01:46] <rb_laptop> TheresaLinx:  what are u trying to compile? maybe a binary is available in a repo?

[01:46] <hydrogen> what is the easiest way to get dual monitors working (laptop screen and external monitor)?
[01:46] <arrenlex> rb_laptop: She said: amsn. And we said: there is.
[01:46] <LjL> un_operateur1: i suggest installing build-essential instead
[01:46] <dabaR> un_operateur1: we install build-essential in Ubuntu
[01:46] <LjL> Ubotu, tell un_operateur1 about build-essential | un_operateur1, see the private message from Ubotu
[01:46] <arrenlex> LjL: The !build-essential factoid doesn't actually tell you to install build-essential; it links you to a long guide instead.
[01:46] <elkbuntu> mamalove, are you now using the same disks you used previously?
[01:46] <arrenlex> LjL: (dunno if you knew)
[01:47] <budward> LjL I am not arguing. elkbuntu specific said that I have been asked serveral times like he was threatning me, when if fact I was only asked once.
[01:47] <budward> anyhow.
[01:47] <mamalove> mnoir - i'm kind of with your thinking that it's a hw issue - but ubuntu installed once b4
[01:47] <LjL> arrenlex: i do know. the first paragraph in that guide told you to install build-essential, last time i checked it
[01:47] <mnoir> from dvd??
[01:47] <mamalove> elkbuntu - yes
[01:47] <mamalove> mnoir - yes
[01:47] <n2diy> LjL:  how do you view private messages ,and don't tell Ubotu to send me one. :)
[01:47] <LjL> n2diy: ...
[01:47] <hydrogen> n2diy, what irc client?
[01:47] <mnoir> dunno - doesn't make sense
[01:47] <LjL> when you get one sent, you usually notice it
[01:47] <un_operateur1> dabaR, LjL -- acknowledged -- but you might be like me quite choosy -- choosing just the bare minimum needed to build from source
[01:47] <timtrimble> im trying to get xorg to display either the same thing on both my svideo and vga out's or just on my svideo out.  anyone able to help?
[01:48] <n2diy> hydrogen:  Xchat for Gnome
[01:48] <LjL> un_operateur1, installing just gcc will hardly ever work. note that TheresaLinx mentioned (well, pasted) a configure script. that means there's a make. that won't work with just gcc.
[01:48] <mamalove> mnoir - yet again, i'm with you :-/
[01:48] <timtrimble> ive gotten svideo to work, just not to do what i'm trying to do right now
[01:48] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: That is not a good thing to recommend to newbies, because they will be back in two minutes with the error message "C compiler cannot create executables".
[01:48] <sudo> test
[01:48] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Which is even more confusing than "it does not exist".
[01:48] <mnoir> mamalove: have you tried any other distributions?  dsl, suse, etc?
[01:48] <jrib> sudo: error
[01:49] <mnoir> even a rescue dist?
[01:49] <SilentDis> mnior:  I'm running DSL on my lappy right now :)
[01:49] <mamalove> mnoir - we're currently running mandriva which we had to install in place of ubuntu :(
[01:49] <mamalove> alongside xp & vista
[01:49] <mnoir> !!!???
[01:49] <mnoir> so they work and 6.10 does not
[01:50] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, LjL I dont get it -- if you install gcc -- make and other dependancies are installed too -- so most source can then be built
[01:50] <dabaR> so much meaning in so few symbols...
[01:50] <mnoir> very odd
[01:50] <timtrimble> im trying to get xorg to display either the same thing on both my svideo and vga out's or just on my svideo out.  anyone able to help?  ive gotten svideo to work, just not to do what i'm trying to do right now

[01:51] <ubotu> sham: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[01:51] <LjL> un_operateur1: true, gcc depends on make, my bad. still, i can assure you that you're very likely to see your compile fail unless it's a "hello world", if you don't install the entire build-essential (hey, it's called 'essential' for something...).
[01:51] <jem> please There are any Ichthux user?

[01:53] <timtrimble> christian version?
[01:53] <timtrimble> why!?
[01:53] <SilentDis> jem:  ahhh.
[01:53] <Jussi01> anyone know how to make wireless work on windows in vmware?
[01:53] <timtrimble> what's so unchristian about regular kubuntu or regular ubuntu
[01:53] <un_operateur1> LjL, but thats maybe because gcc suggests all the core packages of build-essential like  make, flex, gdb, bison, etc
[01:53] <sham> if u rchristian?
[01:53] <factboy818181> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37844/
[01:53] <jem> well... for chrsitians
[01:53] <SilentDis> timtrimble:  it has some 'content filters' in it, from what I understand
[01:53] <Aar0n444> LOL
[01:53] <arrenlex> timtrimble: Because christians are a downtrodden minority desperately trying to remind the world that they exist.
[01:53] <dabaR> timtrimble: cause christians use computers too

[01:54] <sham> i  want  a muslim ubuntu! :P
[01:54] <timtrimble> i like how i get 3 responses to that, but no responses to my actual problem
[01:54] <LjL> un_operateur1: *suggests*, right. which means they aren't getting installed by default
[01:54] <Jussi01> anyone know how to make wireless work on windows in vmware?
[01:54] <jem> http://ichthiux.free.fr/wikini/wakka.php?wiki=PrimeraPagina&nlang=es
[01:54] <SilentDis> sham:  there is 'satanic ubuntu' as well rofl
[01:54] <un_operateur1> LjL, errm, IIRC aptitude install gcc installed the suggests packages too
[01:54] <PriceChild> Silly question... why can't I ssh into my box? I'm getting error 22, connection refused
[01:55] <jem> Oh english : http://ichthiux.free.fr/wikini/wakka.php?wiki=Main&nlang=en
[01:55] <LjL> un_operateur1, aptitude installs *recommends* by default, not suggests
[01:55] <wilburpf> what's so wrong with people making customized distro-spawns that come default with configurations that better suit their needs?

[01:55] <un_operateur1> LjL, atleast in my case it did -- because all the suggested packages are installed on my box
[01:55] <SilentDis> Pricechild:  you need to install the full ssh package.  sudo apt-get install ssh :)
[01:55] <nightless> hello there :0 im running a nearly clean install of ubuntu edgy, and my ethernet worked right from boot, but after installing a wireless card botht he wireless card and the ethernet don't work.  ive tried uninstalling the wireless card, but the ethernet _still_ doesnt work, i've tried everything i can :(
[01:55] <PriceChild> SilenceGold, thanks
[01:55] <wilburpf> perhaps the christian version contains family-oriented filters already set for certain content (however ineffective they may be at times)
[01:55] <timtrimble> im trying to get xorg to display either the same thing on both my svideo and vga out's or just on my svideo out.  anyone able to help?  ive gotten svideo to work, just not to do what i'm trying to do right now
[01:55] <PriceChild> SilenceGold, fresh install, middle of night, slow :)
[01:55] <jrib> factboy818181: meld opens fine here.  What version of ubuntu are you using and how do you run meld?
[01:55] <PriceChild> SilenceGold, just remember it working last time :)
[01:55] <jem> No, You are not understanding the point. Christian version of Linux are versions who have things useful for us
[01:56] <jem> No thing more
[01:56] <n2diy> My CD burner is acting flakey, and it seems to be ok after a restart. Any idea how I can get it functioning again, without restarting?
[01:56] <Jussi01> bump...anyone know how to make wireless work on windows in vmware?
[01:56] <arrenlex> jem: Is that the one with Jesus preinstalled?
[01:56] <Aar0n444> Obviously
[01:56] <wilburpf> you shouldn't insult users of ubuntu or ubuntu variants
[01:56] <jem> SOmething like that
[01:56] <wilburpf> not if you like ubuntu yourself
[01:57] <dabaR> arrenlex: I know you are joking, but it will come across wrong.
[01:57] <SilentDis> I would like to take a moment to remind all in the room that not everyone subscribes to your views.  different distros for different folks, as it were.  I myself am an athiest, but I see the purpose of such a fork being made available.  :)

[01:57] <SilentDis> jem:  what kind of problems are you having?  I must have missed your question.  I'll take it from a kubuntu viewpoint :)
[01:57] <neurosis__> The maker??
[01:57] <peanutb> Jussi01, what type of card?
[01:57] <jem> Ichthux is almost the sme than Ubuntu CD but in Kubuntu
[01:58] <jem> Ubuntu CE
[01:58] <dabaR> jem: did you ask about what you need help with?
[01:58] <factboy818181> jrib: edgy, and via terminal/menu
[01:58] <factboy818181> it just doesn't compare files
[01:58] <jrib> factboy818181: do you just execute "meld"?
[01:58] <PriceChild> !lamp > PriceChild
[01:58] <jem> Oh yes yes
[01:58] <factboy818181> it opens fines
[01:58] <factboy818181> in terminal
[01:58] <factboy818181> yep
[01:58] <peanutb> Jussi01, as in usb, or pcmcia?
[01:58] <dabaR> jem: can you ask again, I missed it.
[01:59] <jem> Well I have Ubuntu 6.06 LTS installed but I would like to install all the Ichthux version with no installing again all the ubuntu
[01:59] <jrib> factboy818181: see if   "meld old new" works for you
[01:59] <ailean> finally got a poker program to work under wine but it's a bit slow on the animation front. any ideas on how to speed it up?
[01:59] <SilentDis> how does one add stuff to ubotu?  I'll append that info about that distro that it's basically a kubuntu (for support reasons), and link in it's homepage.
[01:59] <LjL> Ubotu, tell SilentDis about bot | SilentDis, see the private message from Ubotu
[01:59] <factboy818181> jrib: crashes
[01:59] <SilentDis> thanks ljl :)
[01:59] <mamalove> anybody got any ideas why everytime i try to install edgy 6.10 my whole system freezes up?
[01:59] <jrib> factboy818181: same error output?
[01:59] <factboy818181> jrib: yep
[01:59] <alex_> alright so i have a question....how do i create a swap partition after already installing ubuntu....?
[02:00] <ed__> anyone here have a radeon 8500 with tv-out working?
[02:00] <arrenlex> alex_: Is your question "how do I create a swap partition", "how do I add a swap partition to ubuntu", or both?
[02:00] <SilentDis> jem:  what version of the Ichthux disk do you have?  I assume there's an 'alternate' CD or full dvd available?
[02:00] <kitche> alex_: you got a partition already made that is type 83?
[02:00] <skeeto> can someone help me with installing the correct nvidia drivers?
[02:00] <nightless> has anyone heard of or can help me/point me to some docs, about ethernet working fine until you install a wireless card, then it just dieing?  im quite lost and have no access to the internet on that machine anymore
[02:00] <alex_> i have ubuntu all installed on one partition
[02:01] <SilentDis> !envy | skeeto
[02:01] <ubotu> skeeto: envy is a Python script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[02:01] <arrenlex> alex_: You're going to have to use gparted to resize ubuntu from the liveCD.
[02:01] <mnoir> jem: advise you start at http://www.ichthux.com/ - it might not be very easy to "sidegrade" to ichthux
[02:01] <skeeto> awesome
[02:01] <skeeto> thank you
[02:01] <jrib> factboy818181: use vimdiff :)  Umm, pastebin the 2 files you are trying, so I can try here
[02:01] <LjL> alex_: 1) use any partitioning program to create a partition of type Linux Swap 2) use mkswap to make that partition actually a swap partition 3) add it to /etc/fstab 4) swapon -a
[02:01] <dabaR> jem: http://www.ichthux.com/en/install
[02:01] <alex_> can i get it somewhere else..like seperately?
[02:01] <arrenlex> alex_: ...Come again?
[02:01] <SilentDis> jem:  I was thinking the same thing as mnoir:  you might be better to upgrade to Edgy, then sidegrade to Ichthux (which is based on edgy, i believe)
[02:02] <ed__> anyone here have a radeon 8500 with tv-out working?  anyone?
[02:02] <LjL> !anyone
[02:02] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:02] <mnoir> no - that install link is good
[02:02] <alex_> the....gparted program included with the ubuntu cd...
[02:02] <n2diy> My CD burner is acting flakey, and it seems to be ok after a restart. Any idea how I can get it functioning again, without restarting?
[02:02] <mnoir> it just requires some new repos
[02:02] <dabaR> jem: make sure you read the facts I linked to, besides the opinions offered here
[02:02] <ed__> ubotu, well... i want to have tv-out on my radeon 8500 but i cant get it to work... does anyone have an xorg.conf i can use?
[02:02] <factboy818181> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37845/
[02:02] <h0ndaracer2> wow my internet was screwed up took me forever to fix it
[02:02] <tsg_> what's the best sound server to use to get Totem and Rhythmbox, et.al. working at the same time?
[02:03] <SilentDis> jem:  otherwise, you might be looking at adding custom repositories for Ichthux, and doing an upgrade from there.

[02:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about umount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:03] <rapid> angel12, umount /dev/devx where x = 1,2,3
[02:03] <n2diy> kitche: it reads fine, but refuses to write, after a reboot it writes fine.
[02:04] <SilentDis> bbiab.  gonna compile info on Ichthux and review how to get it into ubotu :)
[02:04] <peanutb> ed__, ubotu is a bot or is automated
[02:04] <kitche> n2diy: yeah sounds like it might be dieing at least the write part of it
[02:04] <neurosis__> angel12: There is a -f (force) option for umount, but it seems only to relate to NFS.

[02:05] <wilburpf> anyone:  does ANYONE know what /sbin/udevsend changed to in the recent upgrade?  Xen fails because it no longer is used (well, in a way it is in order for certain udev events to even work, so obviously it has been renamed/relocated)
[02:05] <n2diy> kitche:  I'd bet it is a flaky module or something, but haven't tried to track it down.
[02:06] <spacing_guild> what's the best sound server to use to get Totem and Rhythmbox, et.al. working at the same time?

[02:09] <jrib> factboy818181: can you start a python shell and import bonobo.ui without error?

[02:15] <Blackstar> sorry
[02:15] <Denyerec> Ubuntu could benefit from some prettier default styling and apps appearing on the "Start" bar when you install them.
[02:15] <spacing_guild> cafuego: Totem also suggested I might need one
[02:15] <cafuego> spacing_guild: Then you need to tell the sound/video applications to use ALSA, not OSS.

[02:30] <darkarcon2015> sapo: hold on, i have an answer
[02:30] <Falstius> Zoss: installing windows overwrote the boot partition.  If you haven't saved anything in ubuntu yet, the easiest thing to do is reinstall ubuntu.  There are less drastic ways but they're cryptic.
[02:30] <sapo> darkarcon2015, ok, thanx
[02:30] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, what do you run?
[02:30] <bulmer> Zoss: windows install normally messes up whats there..so now you need to re-install linux

[02:31] <rob> spacing_guild: does it work if you reboot?
[02:31] <darkarcon2015> sapo: then restart mysql
[02:31] <spacing_guild> rob: yes, the card in the PCMCIA port works if I boot up with it in.
[02:31] <twissy> mzuverlink, did u try in terminal: emerald --replace
[02:31] <spacing_guild> if not, or if I want to switch cards, it won't read the new card
[02:31] <Falstius> Zoss: sorry, boot record not partition.  The boot record is the first kilobyte or so of the disk.  You need to fix that boot record, and the simplest way is to reinstall ubuntu.
[02:31] <rob> spacing_guild: try restarting the pcmcia service

[02:33] <lupine_85> yeah. changes / to somewhere else for a bit
[02:33] <Falstius> Zoss, when you install ubuntu, it will install the grub "boot loader" which will give you a chose of booting windows or linux.  There will be a message while the machine is booting telling you what to do.
[02:33] <ivx> arrenlex, thanks
[02:33] <cafuego> You don't want the files to be 777 though.
[02:33] <Zoss> Oh...ok
[02:33] <Zoss> I'll go and do that..
[02:34] <jrib> factboy818181: all I get on google is old bugs about a missing file in the bonobo packages
[02:34] <Zoss> I'll be back lol.
[02:34] <h0ndaracer2> how come my firewall kepts blocking attacks from this ip 212.204.214.114
[02:34] <h0ndaracer2> should i do like whois
[02:34] <cafuego> better would be chmod ugo+rwX -R dir/
[02:34] <cafuego> Note X not x
[02:34] <Falstius> lupine_85: using chroot to reinstall grub can be a real pain if you don't know what you're doing.
[02:34] <factboy818181> jrib: hmm... does meld work on your system?
[02:34] <h0ndaracer2> or finger to find out more
[02:34] <jrib> factboy818181: yeah
=== khally is now known as khaladan
[02:34] <lupine_85> Falstius: yeah. 6 minutes and 5 commands...
[02:34] <arrenlex> cafuego: What does that do, exactly? And why is it better?
[02:34] <factboy818181> jrib: can you give me a list of your python packages?
[02:34] <Falstius> lupine_85: with a fresh system and a newbie, reinstalling is easier.  If I bork my system that way, I chroot.
[02:35] <jrib> factboy818181: suggestions for obtaining such a list?
[02:35] <cafuego> arrenlex: 'X' only sets the x bit for a file or directory if it has at least ONE x bit set already
[02:35] <lupine_85> reinstalling is the daft way out
[02:35] <superkirbyartist> Problems with Rosegarden.
[02:35] <arrenlex> cafuego: I meant the whole thing. xD
[02:35] <dabaR> superkirbyartist: good title
[02:35] <lupine_85> besides, at the end Zoss would be less of a "newbie"
[02:35] <jrib> factboy818181: do you have python-gnome2-extras ?
[02:35] <ivx> arrenlex, it is saying cannot acess "777" no such file or dir
[02:36] <cafuego> arrenlex: [u] ser [g] group [o] ther + [r] ead [w] rite e[X] ecutable
[02:36] <factboy818181> jrib: yep
[02:36] <superkirbyartist> Anyways, I also have problem with splash.
[02:36] <factboy818181> python-gnome2-extras is already the newest version.
[02:36] <_bt> hi, i have installed gftp from source using checkinstall (so i can use TLS), but how can i stop "update manager" trying to update to the latest ubuntu package?
[02:36] <arrenlex> cafuego: That sounds exactly like 777 but harder to remember. o_o
[02:36] <Falstius> lupine_85: then tell him how to do it.  I'm not going to argue.
[02:36] <cafuego> arrenlex: No, it's not the same. 777 is wrx, not rwX
[02:37] <superkirbyartist> Ahem.
[02:37] <arrenlex> cafuego: That's beyond me. xD Nevermind. Thanks.
[02:37] <mamalove> evening room
[02:37] <ivx> hey i am trying to do chmod to read and write all to a dir an all the contence, what is that command for that?
[02:37] <cafuego> arrenlex: X only sets execute if it's aready an executable OR a directory. So you don't end up with executable data files. (which is ugly)
[02:38] <Falstius> ivx:  chmod a+rw
[02:38] <arrenlex> ivx: and then chown -R <username>:<username> <dir>
[02:38] <jrib> factboy818181: see if running   ORBit.load_typelib('Bonobo')
[02:39] <mamalove> elkubuntu i've just tried installing FC6 after numerous failed attempts at installing edgy 6.10 and my system is STILL freezing up...any ideas?
[02:39] <jrib> factboy818181: in python gives you better info
[02:39] <Falstius> ivx: to get a directory and all its contents, chmod -R a+rw <directory name>
[02:39] <schisms> mamalove, fc6 is terrible.
[02:39] <Hexidigital> what window manager do you guys think works best w/ enlightenment? metacity or kwin?
[02:39] <schisms> Try xubuntu
[02:40] <kitche> Hexidigital: umm enlightenment works best with enlightenment since it's a window manager and not a desktop environment
[02:40] <LadyNikon> you guys might wanna ban ur2nub
[02:40] <mamalove> schisms - i have darling, but my system keeps freezing everytime i try to install it - even when live, the system freezes :(
[02:40] <LadyNikon> before he comes in here
[02:40] <factboy818181> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37852/
[02:40] <schisms> I wonder.
[02:40] <wastrel> "ubunto"
[02:40] <nightless> has anyone heard of installing a wireless card in ubuntu causing the ethernet previously installed to stop working entirely?
[02:40] <LadyNikon> uR2nUb <~~ spamming racist remarks in freenode channels
[02:40] <schisms> What kind of computer do you have?
[02:40] <LjL> LadyNikon: actually, he did come. and he's banned
[02:40] <LadyNikon> LjL: ok .. tried to give a heads up.. but i guess i was to late :(
[02:40] <LadyNikon> gn all
[02:41] <Hexidigital> kitche::  oh... well, the reason i ask, it is using the default backgrounds, etc from kde
[02:41] <arrenlex> wastrel: I've never understood how those people manage to join this channel.
[02:41] <wastrel> heh
[02:41] <Hexidigital> kitche::  i thought it was a desktop environment
[02:41] <arrenlex> What's with this channel today? Jeesh.
[02:41] <kitche> Hexidigital: well e17 is but it's considered a window manager
[02:41] <Shan1> anyone running compiz on kubuntu?
[02:42] <cafuego> Full of children.
[02:42] <Farm_Fres1>  everyone just get a file request?
[02:42] <arrenlex> Yes.
[02:42] <mamalove> schisms amd 64 2600+ 2Gb ram nvidia N660GT 250Gb sata (no raid)
[02:42] <Hexidigital> kitche::  ah... ok (because that's what i'm using)
[02:42] <Hexidigital> kitche::  thanks :)
[02:42] <Shan1> I want to run compiz with the default theme of kubuntu, how's that work?
[02:42] <schisms> I think the nvidia card is the problem.
[02:42] <ivx> falstius, one of the folders is still set to root as owner
[02:42] <mamalove> ubuntu installed once b4
[02:42] <mamalove> no probs
[02:42] <kitche> Shan1: a lot of people use beryl instead of compiz and beryl is more full featured
[02:43] <schisms> Where does it freeze exactly?
[02:43] <jrib> factboy818181: you need to import ORBit first
[02:43] <schisms> Use beryl, it's a lot better.
[02:43] <schisms> But more buggy.
[02:43] <mamalove> at any given time - no warning
[02:43] <Shan1> I used Beryl with gnome, but i thought i'd try compiz with my first kde install
[02:43] <schisms> Really?
[02:43] <mamalove> sometimes when installing, sometimes when surfing
[02:43] <Shan1> plus i couldn't figure out beryl with metacity's theme
[02:43] <un_operateur1> I thought beryl was compiz-updated
[02:43] <Falstius> ivx: to fix that you need chown.  Try, "sudo chown -R `whoami`:`whoami` <directory>"
[02:43] <schisms> Try installing, and try finding the beta nvidia card drivers.
[02:43] <Falstius> without the quotes.
[02:43] <schisms> It MAY help.
[02:43] <mamalove> even with puppy live - system seized up
[02:44] <totall_6_7> thank you rob
[02:44] <kitche> un_operateur1 it used to be when it was compiz-quinnstorm but they just made a fork since Novell wouldn't put the patches in normal compiz
[02:44] <factboy818181> jrib: import ORBit ?
[02:44] <rob> np
[02:44] <zspada15> rob, why are we banning people now?
[02:44] <mamalove> don't get the opportunity to install - it always freezes...:(
[02:44] <_bt> hi, i have installed gftp from source using checkinstall (so i can use TLS), but how can i stop "update manager" trying to update to the latest ubuntu package?
[02:44] <jrib> factboy818181: these are the packages I have installed with the word bonobo in them:  libbonobo2-0 libbonobo2-common libbonobo2-dev libbonoboui2-0 libbonoboui2-common libbonoboui2-dev liblpint-bonobo-dev liblpint-bonobo0 .  yes "import ORBit"
[02:44] <rob> zspada15: dcc sploit'
[02:44] <h0ndaracer2> how do u stop pinging
[02:44] <h0ndaracer2> ?
[02:44] <dabaR> h0ndaracer2: ctrl-c
[02:44] <un_operateur1> novell eh -- more reason not to use compiz then
[02:44] <cafuego> h0ndaracer2: ctrl-c
[02:45] <jbroome> hahah
[02:45] <h0ndaracer2> lol it did 46 packets and didnt ever stop
[02:45] <Aar0n444> how can I tell me kernel version
[02:45] <dabaR> Aar0n444: uname -r
[02:45] <h0ndaracer2> lol i just asked
[02:45] <gnomefreak> Aar0n444: uname -a
[02:45] <h0ndaracer2> that
[02:45] <Aar0n444> Thanks
[02:46] <Shan1> schisms, do you know how to use metacity's or kwin's theme with an aiglx windows manager?
[02:46] <h0ndaracer2> what happens if you ping a ip too much
[02:46] <Aar0n444> Nothing
[02:46] <schisms> Well.
[02:46] <n2diy> Besides /home, what should I back up for a bare metal recovery?
[02:46] <schisms> My friend might know.
[02:46] <schisms> I'll ask him.
[02:46] <zspada15> h0ndaracer2, if its a super slow conection it could get bumped offline
[02:46] <gnomefreak> rob kline him please
[02:46] <diskus> nothing will happen, if packet size is not big
[02:46] <h0ndaracer2> i c
[02:46] <schisms> Wait
[02:46] <schisms> I think I know
[02:46] <rob> gnomefreak: ?
[02:46] <bds> @n2diy /etc
[02:47] <rob> gnomefreak: have been
[02:47] <gnomefreak> the ur guy
[02:47] <bds> has most of your configs
[02:47] <gnomefreak> hes still sending them
[02:47] <bds> that are system wide
[02:47] <arrenlex> -__-
[02:47] <h0ndaracer2> well my firewall kepts blocking request or something from this one ip what should i do i did whois and nslookup
[02:47] <zspada15> rob, i just got a DCC from him
[02:47] <crazeej> anybody here use the Listen music player?
[02:47] <zspada15> rob of course it was malformed
[02:47] <DBO> zspada15, its taken care of =)
[02:47] <zspada15> thanks
[02:47] <factboy818181> jrib: apt-getting packages
[02:47] <mamalove> schisms - u know any "get-arounds" to install ubuntu with my nvidia card?
[02:47] <n2diy> bds, nothing in /var or /usr?
[02:48] <schisms> Sorry, can't help you there.  I'm sure someone should know.  Try the wiki
[02:48] <Shan1> which video card do you have mama?
[02:48] <Zoss> Ok,  I've got a windows partion as my boot drive, and linux as another partition, how do I boot to my linux partition?
[02:48] <jvai__> wow, alot of broken routers.
[02:48] <h0ndaracer2> can you ping a ip too much and get reported for it
[02:48] <mamalove> will do - thx
[02:48] <schisms> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=nvidia&titlesearch=Titles
[02:48] <itsmabus> what are some programs for power management? ie: to see the power level of my battery, put my machine on standby, or hibernate to disk, etc.
[02:48] <bds> n2diy: How much space do you have
[02:49] <bds> n2diy: If only a CD or so
[02:49] <crazeej> anybody konw why the lyrics feature isn't working in Listen??
[02:49] <mamalove> much appreciated :)
[02:49] <dabaR> h0ndaracer2: yes theoretically, but not for 46 pings
[02:49] <Zoss> Anyone can answer my question ^?
[02:49] <n2diy> bds, 40g, 31 free
[02:49] <Farm_Fres1> so whats up with that file?  irc's was of virus attacks?
[02:49] <h0ndaracer2> so but if i left it doing all night then i could get reported
[02:49] <Farm_Fres1> *way
[02:49] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, not really -- most people set their computers/routers to drop pings
[02:49] <h0ndaracer2> ic i forgot that
[02:49] <diskus> Zoss: boot from CD and install grub again or try to modify boot.ini on C: don't know anything about that
[02:50] <bds> n2diy: How much can you *backup*?
[02:50] <Zoss> What is grub diskus?
[02:50] <diskus> Zoss: boot loader
[02:50] <bds> n2diy: are you looking to do a reinstall?
[02:50] <kitche> Zoss: it should have installed grub or did you install windows after linux?
[02:50] <n2diy> bds, but I don't want to back up everything, the install cd can handle most of it no?
[02:50] <Zoss> Ok..how do I use it?
[02:50] <diskus> Zoss: fancy tool where you can choose what operating system to boot
[02:50] <Zoss> Yea
[02:50] <rpereira> could any one of all this people tell me if I run the command "postmap -q xxx@yyy mysql:/etc/postfix/my_map.cf" it should appear "xxx@yyy" if that is a valid email?
[02:50] <Zoss> Linux first, then windows
[02:50] <diskus> Zoss: read manuals maybe?
[02:50] <illovae> hello
[02:51] <Zoss> I install linux first then windows, shouldn't I have?
[02:51] <Zoss> ed*
[02:51] <kitche> Zoss: you have to install grub then you can use a grub cd to do it also
[02:51] <Aar0n444> h0ndaracer2 what are you pinging then?
[02:51] <arrenlex> Zoss: You shouldn't have.
[02:51] <diskus> Zoss: you should have done that vice versa
[02:51] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Zoss about grub | Zoss, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:51] <n2diy> bds, I want to recover from a system crash, whether it is a hd failure, or an update failure.
[02:51] <Zoss> Crud.
[02:51] <factboy818181> jrib: still same error
[02:51] <h0ndaracer2> idk i was just curious over some stuff
[02:51] <Zoss> So...what should I do know?
[02:51] <bds> ah
[02:51] <diskus> Zoss: boot from CD and read about grub
[02:51] <lupine_85> Zoss :)
[02:51] <h0ndaracer2> never really used ping on windows except to get ips to go on blocked websites at school
[02:51] <Zoss> My live cd?
[02:51] <arrenlex> Zoss: The private message LjL sent you has information about how to recover grub.
[02:51] <diskus> Zoss: or if that Linux install is fresh, then just reinstall maybe?
[02:51] <lupine_85> yeah, in the live CD
[02:52] <lupine_85> then it's a few commands in the terminal and you're alive again
[02:52] <bds> n2diy: are you going to automate this?
[02:52] <bds> n2diy: or run via cron?
[02:52] <crazeej> anybody know why the lyrics feature isn't working in Listen??
[02:52] <Zoss> Yea..I'm on my live cd atm...I'm a really bad linux user so is it possible to tell me what to do?
[02:52] <schisms> Zoss
[02:52] <lupine_85> ok :) do you know what partitions linux and windows are on?
[02:52] <Zoss> Yes.
[02:52] <h0ndaracer2> how come my network proxy that comes with the distro doesnt work i set it up and everything but when i go to ipchicken.com it shows my real ip
[02:52] <bds> n2diy: do you have another computer or device you can backup to?
[02:52] <Shaezsche> im trying to get ubuntu to boot as fast as possible. how do you recommend i partition my drive? currently have a swap partition, and then a Logical partition with /boot, /, and /home within it. Does making a seperate /boot partition help with boot speed?
[02:53] <schisms> Try the wiki if we can't help.
[02:53] <un_operateur1> !tor
[02:53] <ubotu> tor: anonymizing overlay network for TCP. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.1.1.23-1 (edgy), package size 763 kB, installed size 1556 kB
[02:53] <bds> n2diy: lets say on your network?
[02:53] <lupine_85> ok. first you need to mount your linux partition. So in a terminal: sudo mount /dev/(linux partition) /mnt
[02:53] <diskus> Shaezsche: why logical?
[02:53] <schisms> shaezsche, try using
[02:53] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, check tor out :)
[02:53] <n2diy> bds, no need to automate, yet, I just want to get the stuff so I can recover.
[02:53] <schisms> sudo apt-get install prelink
[02:53] <h0ndaracer2> i have tor
[02:53] <schisms> It speeds it up a bit
[02:53] <kingace> off the live cd, how long should an ntfsresize from 60 gig to 30 gig take?
[02:53] <Shaezsche> i dont know, why not logical? isnt it good to subsume everything?
[02:53] <n2diy> bds, no network.
[02:53] <h0ndaracer2> but i dont know anything on how to use it or set it up
[02:53] <lupine_85> then in the same terminal: sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
[02:54] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, are you using firefox or something similar?
[02:54] <Shaezsche> does a seperate /boot help speed boot? what filesystem is best for /boot? and how big should it be
[02:54] <diskus> Shaezsche: well I always made only primary partitions in Linux :P
[02:54] <h0ndaracer2> firefox
[02:54] <diskus> Shaezsche: well maybe it will be 10ms faster
[02:54] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, verify the proxy settings in firefox then --
[02:54] <lupine_85>  /mnt *should* exist... create it if not (sudo mkdir /mnt)
[02:54] <poppyer> hi, can anybody using Madwifi-old driver in Edgy share the deb with me?
[02:54] <h0ndaracer2> but thats just for my internet browser
[02:54] <bds> n2diy: I am not sure what tools are available to do sytem restore in an automagical sense
[02:54] <bds> n2diy: but
[02:54] <h0ndaracer2> im wanting to do the whole computer
[02:54] <diskus> Shaezsche: having seperate /boot is usualy a good thing, you can unmount it during runing time
[02:54] <con-man> i have been trying to get divX/Xvid movies to play but I cannot.  I have installed xvid and win32codecs, but it doesnt work. what am I missing?
[02:55] <zspada15> poppyer, i might have the deb
[02:55] <kitche> diskus: /boot has to be on a primary partition :) you can have up to 4 primary partitions
[02:55] <bds> n2diy: most of your conifugartions
[02:55] <factboy818181> jrib: ?
[02:55] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, is tor the application you use to "hide" your IP address??
[02:55] <lupine_85> diskus: that can cause much fun when kernel updates come through :p
[02:55] <factboy818181> con-man: VLC media player?
[02:55] <bds> n2diy: will be located in
[02:55] <diskus> lupine_85: just have to remember to mount it :P
[02:55] <poppyer> zspada15, thanks very much, can you share it with me?
[02:55] <h0ndaracer2> no i dont know how to use tor or set it up
[02:55] <zspada15> poppyer, no i dont
[02:55] <zspada15> but
[02:55] <lupine_85> :D
[02:55] <Falstius> con-man: gstreamer10-plugins-ugly
[02:55] <bds> n2diy: /etc for system wide, maybe /usr/local/etc and /home
[02:55] <Shaezsche> do certain filesystem boot faster than others? will reiserfs boot faster than ext3?
[02:55] <diskus> kitche: well yeah, I tend to have about 4 so that's why I haven't thinked about logical partitions yet
[02:55] <lupine_85> Zoss: have you mounted the linux partition yet?
[02:55] <bds> n2diy: for example
[02:55] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, you said you had tor?  anyway, what do you use instead?
[02:56] <Zoss> Er
[02:56] <Zoss> No...
[02:56] <zspada15> poppyer, ill find it for u
[02:56] <Falstius> con-man: or as factboy said, vlc.  It plays better than totem.
[02:56] <Zoss> I just went to get a pen and paper
[02:56] <crazeej> anybody know why the lyrics feature isn't working in Listen??\
[02:56] <zspada15> poppyer, you want the one for dapper?
[02:56] <con-man> Falstius: thats not in my repo list, can you recommend a source?
[02:56] <bds> n2diy: I am running of a live cd now
[02:56] <lupine_85> oh, ok :)
[02:56] <Zoss> Cuz I might have found a solution thanks to ubotu
[02:56] <poppyer> zspada15, i want the one for edgy
[02:56] <bds> n2diy: but copyied in my .gaim directory
[02:56] <diskus> Shaezsche: why do you need it to be fast, is there particular reason?
[02:56] <h0ndaracer2> the one ubuntu came with the system-preference-network proxy
[02:56] <con-man> Falstius: I have gstreamer stuff, just not the ugly one
[02:56] <h0ndaracer2> and it doesnt work
[02:56] <bds> n2diy: it had all my signin info etc
[02:56] <lupine_85> well, the remainder of how I'd do it is: "sudo chroot /mnt" followed by "grub-install"
[02:56] <bds> n2diy: configs for largers things would surely be stored in /etc
[02:56] <Falstius> con-man: do you activate the universe partitions?
[02:57] <Shaezsche> it must be fast, its part of my justification for using it over windows
[02:57] <n2diy> dbs, sbackup defaults to /home, /etc, /var, and /usr, but I've been told backing up all of /usr is like a full back up. So /usr/local/etc makes sense.
[02:57] <Shaezsche> do certain filesystem boot faster than others? will reiserfs boot faster than ext3?
[02:57] <poppyer> or if you are using edgy(generic kernel) and madwifi-old, you can just copy the binary to me :)
[02:57] <diskus> never actualy tested booting speeds
[02:57] <lupine_85> grub-install might need you to say "grub-install /dev/hda" (or /dev/sda, or sdb/hdb, or whatever the device is)
[02:57] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, I have a feeling that utility just proxies web/WWW traffic for your browsers and not everything
[02:57] <diskus> and ubuntu boots a lot faster than my windows xp :P
[02:57] <kitche> Shaezsche: there is no real difference in speed it just depends what boot loader you use and the scripts that you have start
[02:57] <lupine_85> but go with what you think is best :)
[02:57] <jrib> factboy818181: we have to learn more about typelib then, see if you can find anything
[02:57] <Aar0n444> On my laptop, to boot Ubuntu I had to add the command "linux nolapic noapic acpi=off" but for some reason it isn't recognising my PCMCIA card (it did when I used a different option a long time ago) any ideas?
[02:57] <con-man> Falstius: haha. the things we forget after a reinstall
[02:57] <Falstius> con-man: you had to have to get win32codecs ... the exact name is "gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly"
[02:57] <SmoothOp> how long is glxgears supposed to run before giving me a report?
[02:57] <con-man> Falstius: thanks
[02:57] <Shaezsche> im still kinda afraid to switch to reiser because i hear if you have unexpected shut downs it can corrupt data
[02:57] <un_operateur1> h0ndaracer2, most public proxies only support basic proxying for www and mail .. nothing more
[02:58] <zspada15> poppyer, have you compiled source beforE?
[02:58] <kitche> SmoothOp it doesn't give you a report it's not a benchmark tool
[02:58] <n2diy> bds, btw, sbackup sucks, so I'm now playing with Mondo, and it wants to burn 3 cds for a total backup. So, if I could get my stuff on one, and use the install cd for the start, it would be cool.
[02:58] <Shaezsche> i shaved 20s off my boot by using the irqpoll command
[02:58] <Falstius> con-man: no problem.  Oh, and that's just for dapper (and I think edgy)
[02:58] <h0ndaracer2> i got another question can i login remotly into my computer from a windows os
[02:58] <poppyer> yes, zspada15, I am getting crazy with the compiling, try it for a whole night
[02:58] <campbch> anyone here familiar with battle for wesnoth?
[02:58] <diskus> Shaezsche: read some tests about filesystem by googleing
[02:58] <con-man> Falstius: i hope edgy, thats what im using
[02:58] <zspada15> poppyer, oh..
[02:58] <Shaezsche> i forgot to set a mount point for my ntfs windows partition during install, is it too late to adjust that?
[02:58] <cornell> Can anybody recommend DVD authoring software for Ubuntu?
[02:59] <jrib> factboy818181: ls /usr/lib/orbit-2.0
[02:59] <un_operateur1> Shaezsche, reiserFS is a journalling file system -- that means if an unexpected shutdown happens -- data is recovered by replaying the journal
[02:59] <campbch> i'm trying to play online, but the official server's running version 1.1.12, which is two versions old and not distributed anymore
[02:59] <campbch> and i don't know what to do?
[02:59] <swanfl> cornell, use qdvdauthor
[02:59] <nofxx> where I need to put my dns servers in xubuntu besides resolv.conf, wich gets erased every boot? 6.10
[02:59] <campbch> did they just not want it to be an option? was it an oversight? or what?
[02:59] <un_operateur1> Shaezsche, you can always mount your windows partition at anytime
[02:59] <swanfl> it's a littel unstable here and there but it works well once you get the hang of it
[02:59] <Shaezsche> then why is it almost universally accepted that ext3 is more reliable? most distros use it by default
[02:59] <Shaezsche> how can i set it to auto mount at /windows?
[03:00] <diskus> un_operateur1: except I've heard that reiserfs and xfs if I remember also, have some strange situations when it breaks
[03:00] <Aar0n444> FFS.
[03:00] <h0ndaracer2> is ubuntu distributing their newest version free yet to ship to you or is it still their older versions on the disk
[03:00] <swanfl> be prepared to compile it yourself, as the official ubuntu package is out of date
[03:00] <dabaR> h0ndaracer2: dapper
[03:00] <cornell> swanfl: I tried it, It keeps crashing on me...  Finally got to where I could make the dvd, and it threw errors about no .ifo file.  But if that's the one to use, I'll keep trying.
[03:00] <h0ndaracer2> ok
[03:00] <Falstius> Shaezsche: ext3 is a journaling file system too.  And it is more mature than Reiser so most distros stick with it.  There was a move to reiser for a while because it has some speed gains, but those have mostly disapeared except in very specific and unusual cases.
[03:00] <dabaR> h0ndaracer2: shipit.ubuntu.com
[03:00] <un_operateur1> diskus, well, there are no guarantees with any FS -- EXtx, Jfs, Xfs or ntfs
[03:01] <Shaezsche> i see
[03:01] <Shaezsche> i forgot to set a mount point for my ntfs windows partition during install, is it too late to adjust that?
[03:01] <triplah_> can anyone tell me the name of xchat's packages? i can only find xchat-gnome
[03:01] <Shaezsche> how can i set it to auto mount at /windows?
[03:01] <swanfl> cornell, are you using the official package?
[03:01] <zspada15> Shaezsche, also ext3 wasnt created by a murderer
[03:01] <Shaezsche> LOLOLOL
[03:01] <jrib> !ntfs | Shaezsche
[03:01] <ubotu> Shaezsche: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[03:01] <dabaR> triplah_: that is its name
[03:01] <cornell> swanfl, I guess... got it from synaptic
[03:01] <n2diy> triplah, that is what I'm using now.
[03:01] <dabaR> !universe > triplah_
[03:02] <kingace> is a swap partition necessary for a computer with 512 mb ram?
[03:02] <triplah_> dabaR, E: Couldn't find package xchat
[03:02] <swanfl> ditch it and build it yourself, cornell: qdvdauthor.sf.net
[03:02] <PriceChild> kingace, best safe than sorry
[03:02] <triplah_> i have universe
[03:02] <triplah_> well i thought i did
[03:02] <dabaR> !xchat
[03:02] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6.6-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 275 kB, installed size 760 kB
[03:02] <PriceChild> kingace, i have one with 768 just incase, although i rarely go over
[03:02] <swanfl> my wife had the same exact problem. she uses it as well
[03:02] <jbroome> good to see ubotu back.
[03:02] <Aar0n444> FFS
[03:02] <PriceChild> kingace, if you run out of ram, things will get zapped randomly
[03:02] <cornell> swanfl.... oooh.... I hate "build it yourself",  But I'll try
[03:03] <jrib> Aar0n444: FFS?
[03:03] <swanfl> good luck :
[03:03] <swanfl> :)
[03:03] <kingace> Pricechild: if i finish the install, and then later on add a swap type partition, will it automatically become my swap partition?
[03:03] <n2diy> cornell, it is part of the learning curve.
[03:03] <cafuego> jrib: fast file system (bsd) or for fuck's sake
[03:03] <cornell> I hope there's a good script, or step by step howto
[03:03] <PriceChild> kingace, if you add it to /etc/fstab , yes
[03:03] <swanfl> I just compiled a kde game, what didn't it want me to install through adept :)
[03:03] <PriceChild> !language cafuego
[03:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about language cafuego - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[03:03] <ubotu> cafuego: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.

[03:03] <kingace> thanks
[03:03] <PriceChild> kingace, good luck :)
[03:03] <Aar0n444> I'm  in GRUB, and I'm trying to edit the boot commands for Ubuntu, and I remove acpi=off to try something, I press enter, then escape to go back to the boot selection. I hit enter on Ubuntu and then I boot. Doesn't work. Return to editor, and the acpi=off is still there
[03:03] <Aar0n444> Any ideas?
[03:04] <cornell> Yeah, but I've got enough stuff to learn... can't do it all at one time ;-)
[03:04] <Shan1> anyone here using compiz or beryl with a metacity or kwin theme?
[03:04] <jrib> cafuego: didn't know about the first one, but I was wondering what the reason for it was
[03:04] <jrib> !anyone | Shan1
[03:04] <ubotu> Shan1: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:04] <cafuego> jrib: Dunno, maybe Aar0n444 ran out of patience with someone/something
[03:04] <n2diy> Aar0n444:  You don't have permission to write to the file. Did you back it up?
[03:05] <Aar0n444> No I didn't back it up
[03:05] <Shan1> sure thing..new to irc...i'm wanting to use kubuntu's default theme with the new install of compiz. i click themes and it never loads
[03:05] <Aar0n444> I just hit Escape before it booted to go into the editor
[03:05] <zspada15> !deb
[03:05] <ubotu> deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[03:05] <kitche> Aar0n444 what does the error that grub outputs
[03:05] <Aar0n444> There isn't an error.
[03:06] <n2diy> Aar0n444: ah your at the boot prompt, I thought you were using gedit.
[03:06] <Aar0n444> Just that my PCMCIA WiFi card doesn't work, and I'm sure it's one of the options I've specified
[03:06] <jrib> factboy818181: *poke*
[03:07] <kitche> Aar0n444 well you said it doesn't work figuring grub
[03:07] <Shan1> how can i use kubuntu's default theme with my new compiz install?
[03:07] <h0ndaracer2> what exactly is shell programing?
[03:08] <dabaR> h0ndaracer2: ask wikipedia
[03:08] <h0ndaracer2> lol i fogot about google
[03:08] <h0ndaracer2> google is my friend
[03:08] <lupine_85> Shan1: you'd need a KDE-compatible window decorator for that
[03:08] <Aar0n444> I once had Ubuntu on my laptop before. I had to use an option (something LIKE "linux nolapic" or acpi or apic) else it wouldn't boot. I'm now booting fine using "linux noapic nolapic acpi=off" and it does boot, just that my PCMCIA WiFi card doesn't work
[03:08] <LjL> h0ndaracer2: well, you know when you type commands in a terminal? well, normally it's just simple one-line commands, but it could be much more complicated things, eventually what's normally called a "shell script"
[03:08] <lupine_85> Beryl has one, and I believe it's been ported to compiz.. not out just yet though
[03:09] <lupine_85> (beryl "aquamarine")
[03:09] <h0ndaracer2> i c is this a good topic to learn
[03:09] <Riyonuk> does ubuntu have a vmware image?
[03:09] <Aar0n444> And the WiFi card worked before. I know it's one of the options I've used
[03:09] <cornell> How about another tack...  I used acidrip to create mpg and avi.  Both of which I can view on ubuntu, but not in windows.  Are there particular settings I need to use in acidrip to get a windows readable mpg?
[03:09] <h0ndaracer2> or should i learn something else first
[03:09] <Shan1> ohh ok. i knew with ubuntu compiz was able to do gnome's themes..i see, thanks!!
[03:09] <lupine_85> shan1: that's gnome-window-decorator
[03:09] <Shan1> yeah
[03:09] <lupine_85> you're just a bit ahead of the source code, that's all :)
[03:10] <Shan1> no problem, i'll get beryl going then! thanks lupine_85!
[03:10] <lupine_85> np. aquamarine is in the repos so easy to install
[03:10] <LjL> h0ndaracer2, it really depends... if this steams from some previous discussion, then well, i didn't follow it. are you interested in learning a programming language? or what?
[03:10] <lupine_85> erm, beryl repos I should say
[03:11] <mariano> can someone help me get sound on flash player videos. I have tried three browsers and still no sound. This is the only thing that I need to fully move over to linux.
[03:11] <Shan1> cool. yeah, i'm new to kde..been a gnome guy for a looong time

[03:12] <Zoss> I think I may need help again...
[03:12] <xu_zhu> as a new user who finally got his wireless working with ndiswrapper (woo!) i have to say that this Add / Remove Programs thing is awesome.
[03:12] <xu_zhu> rather than having to buy CDRoms when you need to do tasks.
[03:13] <h0ndaracer2> is that a easy one to learn compared to c and perl
[03:13] <xu_zhu> python instead of java?
[03:13] <factboy818181> jrib: oops
[03:13] <factboy818181> hi
[03:13] <h0ndaracer2> i know some java myselff but not much and i know html fairly well
[03:13] <jrib> h0ndaracer2: try python, docs.python.org tutorial and diveintopython.org are a good start
[03:13] <jrib> factboy818181: hi
[03:13] <h0ndaracer2> ok thanks
[03:14] <Zoss> Ok..I installed linux first then windows. How do I boot to linux? Note: I'm new to linux...
[03:14] <jrib> Zoss: when you start your computer is it jsut going straight to windows now?

[03:15] <jrib> factboy818181: ah ha! you are missing Bonobo_module.so
[03:16] <factboy818181> atut: apt-get install ntfs-3g
[03:16] <jrib> factboy818181: sudo aptitude reinstall libbonobo2-common
[03:16] <factboy818181> atut: then: sudo ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows -o force
[03:16] <factboy818181> that's assuming your windows partition is on /dev/hda1
[03:16] <CaBlGuY> ok, before I go bidding on a printer on Ebay, what brand woks the best with Ubuntu...  IE, no problems installing and printing etc..?

[03:17] <atut> i understand factboy818181, but where can i get ntfs-3g?
[03:17] <CaBlGuY> IE, HP, Lexmark.. etc..
[03:17] <aztracker1> What's funny is my printer has a driver (gpl) from the mfg, but doesn't seem to work right under ubuntu for me.. :(  (brother)

[03:17] <Aar0n444> Epson are pretty cheap to get carts for
[03:17] <atut> factboy818181, can I just mount it using mount command, dont use ntfs-3g command
[03:18] <aztracker1> older HP's are well supported  Laserjet 5.. if you can find em..
[03:18] <factboy818181> atut: do you need read write, or just read?
[03:18] <atut> read & write
[03:18] <Zoss> Someone help me? ^ If you ever looked at my question?
[03:18] <CaBlGuY> Aar0n444:  do they work on Linux though..  THAT'S what Im askin...
[03:18] <factboy818181> atut: ntfs-3g is what you need for accessing NTFS in ubuntu
[03:18] <h0ndaracer2> ok i got those 2 things from those sites about python
[03:18] <h0ndaracer2> now read them
[03:18] <eegore> I installed 4 gigs of ram in this box and the os only sees 3
[03:18] <factboy818181> atut: try googling for main site, download the .deb, then dpkg -i the deb
[03:18] <Aar0n444> CaBlGuY there's a list.
[03:18] <mariano> I installed the flash plugins and still no sound from flash player
[03:18] <Aar0n444> Go through it.
[03:18] <mariano> can anyone help
[03:19] <atut> factboy818181: ok, what if i just need "read" access? without using ntfs-3g, how to mount it?
[03:19] <jbroome> eegore: then you have to send me the extra GB stick
[03:19] <n2diy> Zoss, I missed the question.
[03:19] <eegore> running dapper
[03:19] <Zoss> I install linux(Ubuntu) first then windows. How do I boot to linux? (Retyped question)
[03:19] <factboy818181> atut: not sure, i just use ntfs-3g because it's really stable
[03:19] <Aar0n444> Or find a good printer, then check the list.
[03:19] <Zoss> installed*
[03:19] <aztracker1> CaBlGuY, honestly, pick out 2-3 that you are interested in, and look at the mfg website, or the cups site (previously mentioned)
[03:19] <mariano> it plays the picture of the video but not the sound
[03:19] <factboy818181> Zoss: GRUB on boot-up?
[03:19] <Gun_Smoke> DBO: home?
[03:19] <aztracker1> CaBlGuY, there is no good brand perse...
[03:19] <factboy818181> Zoss: oops.. you overwrote GRUB
[03:19] <Zoss> I'm a newbie to linux factboy
[03:19] <factboy818181> Zoss: with the windows install...
[03:19] <Zoss> I don't know if i did that lol
[03:19] <n2diy> Zoss, you did it backwards, Windows doesn't play with linux, install windows, and then Ubuntu.
[03:19] <factboy818181> exactly :D
[03:19] <Zoss> I don't want to reformat again!
[03:19] <PriceChild> factboy818181, ntfs-3g _may_ still cause data loss
[03:19] <Zoss> =.= crap.
[03:20] <h0ndaracer2> get rid of windows
[03:20] <atut> there is someway to boot into ubunto without installing
[03:20] <Zoss> -.- damnit..is there anyother way?
[03:20] <mariano> i'm trying to get rid of windows
[03:20] <atut> there is someway to boot into ubunto without re-installing/re-formatting
[03:20] <LjL> atut: sure, the Desktop CD.
[03:20] <jbroome> atut: use a live cd
[03:20] <kitche> Zoss: you can always use a live cd to boot into ubuntu when you want to use it, or a grub cd
[03:20] <mariano> I dont want to pay that 400 bucks for the vista update
[03:20] <eegore> Is there something in the kernel that will not go beyond 3 gigs?
[03:20] <factboy818181> jrib: you saved me!
[03:20] <factboy818181> jrib: it works now!  awesome :D thankies
[03:20] <Zoss> I am on my live cd atm
[03:20] <aztracker1> I blew up my first two installs of ubuntu... had to use live cd to get my data off.. :)
[03:21] <w30> ! repair grub after windows install
[03:21] <Zoss> How do I do that?
[03:21] <jrib> factboy818181: np, give vimdiff a try if you like vim.  It's pretty similar
[03:21] <Zoss> @w30
[03:21] <cafuego>  mariano Well, there is no law that says you have to.

[03:22] <jbroome> reiatzu: don't be a douche
[03:22] <aztracker1> mariano, I use a vmware xp setup for the 2-3 programs I have to have in windows.
[03:22] <mariano> so, I might have to use windows at work
[03:22] <Zoss> I TOLD YOU IN PM
[03:22] <reiatzu> jbroome: silence
[03:22] <mariano> do   you use vmware for flash player?

[03:23] <Zoss> Well it sat there for like 1 minute at least.
[03:23] <Zoss> So I rebooted it..
[03:23] <kitche> kernel/kerenl

[03:24] <h0ndaracer2> go to the pantry
[03:24] <h0ndaracer2> jj
[03:24] <zspada15> Zoss, it should have been installed on your system
[03:25] <kitche> Zoss: it's on the ubuntu install you have to chroot in and mount /proc to be able to run grub-install again
[03:25] <Zoss> zspada15: What should have? Grub? I hardly know about it
[03:25] <kitche> Zoss: did you read the how-to that ubotu told you about?
[03:25] <Zoss> kitche: I'm new to linux, explain more thoughrly.
[03:25] <Zoss> Yes.
[03:25] <h0ndaracer2> im new2
[03:25] <Zoss> I tryed rescue, it um froze.
=== Nullified is now known as Megalodon
[03:26] <h0ndaracer2> ok im gona take a break i need to get away from the computer for a little bit
[03:27] <kitche> Zoss: try this one https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows#head-bf3232f10ddf1b078de064622ccbb25225cdb3c0 this one uses the livecd instead of the rescue mode
[03:27] <Zoss> Ah...
[03:27] <Zoss> Good cuz i'm using my live cd atm
[03:27] <Zoss> Ok
[03:27] <Zoss> I'll try it
[03:27] <Zoss> And i'll be back
[03:27] <moab_> anyone here know the status of the acpi suspend bug?
[03:28] <jbroome> moab_: proabbly not, check launchpad
[03:28] <reiatzu> frogs
[03:28] <reiatzu> hi friend jbroome
[03:29] <SmoothOp> is ubuntu using x.org?
[03:29] <kitche> SmoothOp: yes
[03:30] <mariano> ok, I am completely lost. I have tried installing flash player manually and via adapt manager and I still get no sound from the flash player
[03:30] <mariano> I just get picture
[03:30] <moab_> jbroome_: I am looking for info newer than what this link provides  http://www.mail-archive.com/laptop-testing-team@lists.ubuntu.com/msg00608.htm
[03:30] <jrib> mariano: what version?
[03:30] <mariano> flash 9 it says
[03:30] <LjL> reiatzu: please avoid flooding the channel like you did before
[03:31] <jrib> mariano: strange, do you have anything else playing sound before you start it?
[03:31] <mariano> well, I have tried both now
[03:31] <mariano> Version:  	7,0,69,0 this is the last one I installed
[03:31] <nothlit> adept manager? check your aRts settings
[03:32] <nothlit> try turning aRTs off even
[03:32] <mariano> nope
[03:32] <mariano> I turned off amarok
[03:32] <adaminla> Can anyone give me some advice re: what printer to buy. Don't want to go over $125 (US).
[03:32] <mariano> I mean, i closed amarok
[03:32] <nothlit> aRts, not amaroK
[03:33] <nothlit> man kde has some funny capitalisations
[03:33] <mariano> how do I turn off arts
[03:33] <arrenlex> adaminla: HP printers work well with Linux.
[03:33] <nothlit> mariano, kcontrol
[03:33] <arrenlex> mariano: kcontrol > Sound & Multimedia > Sound System > uncheck "enable the sound system"
[03:33] <adaminla> All the loess expensive ones?
[03:34] <arrenlex> adaminla: HP printers generally work with Linux. All of them. Be sure to check linuxprinting.com first, though.
[03:34] <mariano> ok, I have unchecked it
[03:34] <mariano> let me try to play a flash video now
[03:34] <nothlit> mariano, make sure its off
[03:34] <adaminla> OK. Thanx Arrenlex.
[03:34] <arrenlex> mariano: Make sure you are using flash 9.
[03:34] <bradley_> is there a way to check specifically the amount of video memory usage?
[03:35] <mariano> I unchecked it and press okay
[03:35] <nothlit> mariano, i don't know how kde manages sounds anymore, you might have to log out/ or restart
[03:35] <w3ccv> linuxprining.com - not found - got a better (more correct) site
[03:35] <mariano> ok
[03:35] <mariano> I will be right back then
[03:35] <nothlit> mariano, but see if it works first
[03:35] <arrenlex> w3ccv: Printing, not prining.
[03:36] <Zoss> Kitie: Can I have that link again if your still here?
[03:36] <w3ccv> arrenlex, my typo but site "not found" now.
[03:36] <mariano> ok
[03:36] <Zoss> kitche: Can I have that link again?
[03:36] <arrenlex> w3ccv: Oh. Hey. It changed recently, I didn't even know. http://www.freestandards.org/en/OpenPrinting
[03:36] <aztracker1> anyone know how to set the default browser for kde and xchat?  when I open a link in xchat it fires up konqueror, despite firefox being my default in ubuntu

[03:37] <jrib> w3ccv: it's .org, it will redirect to whatever the new site is
[03:37] <Zoss> Lol ty

[03:40] <nothlit> aztracker1, theres a command line app for it but i don't know the all the listings... it might be update-alternatives x-www-browser
[03:40] <mariano> I have flash player 9 plugin
[03:40] <jughead> Megalodon, you can ctl+alt+f1 to get to a terminal
[03:40] <aztracker1> I have kcontrol up..
[03:40] <cjlowe> Megalodon,control + alt + f1
[03:40] <mariano> I unchecked enable sound system
[03:40] <arrenlex> cjlowe: Yes, but it won't give you a command line.
[03:40] <cjlowe> arrenlex, true.
[03:40] <mariano> and logged off
[03:41] <Zoss> kitche: For my root (hd X,X) command. What do I type if my partition is sda2?
[03:41] <aztracker1> arrenlex, where in kcontrol?  I don't see a component chooser
[03:42] <kitche> Zoss: think it will be root (sd1,1) think that's how grub does SATA drives
[03:42] <jvai__> hey ppl.. ty so much.. gn
[03:42] <nothlit> mariano, did you get a dialog box saying aRts is disabled?
[03:42] <Zoss> Hm
[03:42] <aztracker1> found it.. kcontrol->kde components->file associations->text->html
[03:42] <Zoss> OK..
[03:42] <aztracker1> guessing that will do it..

[03:42] <arrenlex> Guys, what's that command which lists what libraries a binary depends on?
[03:43] <kitche> zoss: hang on it would be root (sd0, 1)

[03:49] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[03:49] <darkroast> stupid question: I'm using Ubuntu on a remote machine; how do I tell what version of Ubuntu is installed
[03:49] <Zoss> I see you briguyd but I can't answer your question.
[03:49] <briguyd> SmoothOp, install the package "alien"

[04:04] <nephish> hey there, if i wanted to use ssh, but wanted to use a different port than 22, how would i do that ?
[04:04] <idlemind> megalodon: i'm very unfamiliar with the newer high end radeon cards as well but have you tried: "rpm -qa | grep xorg" and then looking on ati.com for linux drivers (they're closed source so if you don't mnind)

[04:08] <ablyss> nephish: you should be able to just ssh hostname and leave all the ports on 22
[04:08] <mister_roboto> nephish: i think you would change /etc/ssh/ssh_config and put the new port in there.
[04:09] <ablyss> all machines in the internal network are reachable via their hostnames.. via the outside ( external network ) the hostnames wont work, generally
[04:09] <mister_roboto> ablyss: he can't forward the same port to two different machines
[04:09] <nephish> well, all the machines look like the same host name from the internet, i need to use unison to sync a folder on two different computers behind the company LAN with my home computer.
[04:09] <Zoss> kitche: Ok..It's almost installed. Now what? I know i'm kinda noob but i'm new
[04:10] <Madduc1> Can someone please help me with an Adept installer problem
[04:10] <ablyss> no need to forward the ports if he uses the private route
[04:10] <mister_roboto> ablyss: he's not coming in from outside the network? that's what i thought he was saying
[04:10] <idlemind> madduc1: not very familiar but i can try, shoot
[04:10] <nephish> right, i am comming from outside the network
[04:10] <Madduc1> I was downloading sun-java and when it went to install Adept locked up. i can't get it to restart, "some other process is using the package database".
[04:10] <mister_roboto> ablyss: in fact, that's exactly what he's saying
[04:10] <Zoss> kitche: You there?
[04:11] <kitche> yes
[04:11] <mister_roboto> nephish: see /etc/ssh/ssh_config
[04:11] <kitche> jsut reboot into ubuntu when it's done without the live cd Zoss
[04:11] <nephish> ok.
[04:11] <Zoss> kitche: And if it doesn't boot to ubuntu but windows?
[04:11] <ablyss> mister_roboto: once he's ssh into a machine he is now in the private network side
[04:11] <ablyss> go figure
[04:12] <idlemind> madduc1: oo ok, use this command: ps -x to find the adept process or 'rpm' similar process
[04:12] <mister_roboto> ablyss: you didn't listen to his problem
[04:12] <ablyss> mister_roboto: i listen well enough to provide a solution
[04:12] <idlemind> madduc1: then use: kill -9 <proc#> command to terminate it (hint for the the obvious just the number not the braces when you type command)
[04:13] <mister_roboto> ablyss: he wants to ssh directly to both machines.   yes, he could just make a tunnel from one machine to the other but you didn't say jack about doing that
[04:14] <ablyss> mister_roboto: obviously
[04:14] <mister_roboto> ablyss: he would STILL have to open 2 ports if he wants to unison between both inner boxes
[04:14] <mister_roboto> ablyss: from the outside, i mean
[04:15] <factboy818181> any news on when OpenOffice 2.1 will be in the repos?
[04:15] <Madduc1> idlemind: i can't tell what process is using the adept process,, sun-java was about 25% installed when it crashed
=== DreamThief808 is now known as DreamThief
[04:16] <idlemind> madduc1: hmm i'm not exactly sure either as i've never used kubuntu and i just recently (2 days ago) transferred to ubuntu from a long time suse user, look for anything adept, rpm, dpgk (i assume)
[04:17] <lance_> Anyone know how to get apache2 to run as a different user on a per-vhost basis? Do you need perchild module, which apparently is broken, and unmaintained?
[04:17] <Gorillasmalls> who know how to run were i can get the tutorial for compiz
[04:18] <ablyss> Madduc #kbuntu channels handles adept problems.
[04:18] <ablyss> er #kubuntu
[04:18] <arrenlex> Madduc1: sudo fuser -mk /var/lib/dpkg/lock && rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[04:18] <arrenlex> Madduc1: Or just restart.
[04:18] <Gorillasmalls> for compiz
[04:18] <nephish> ok, well i changed 22 to 23 under the port, does this mean i will have to change it every time i change which machine i sync ? or should it be able to take two ports if i disable strict checking ( because they will have the same domain name)
[04:18] <idlemind> thanx ablyss and arrenlex
[04:18] <idlemind> afk while i get my chinesse food from the door

[04:18] <Gorillasmalls> thanks
[04:19] <realitychx> anyone using easyubuntu?
[04:19] <darkroast> realitychx: no, I use automatix2
[04:19] <ablyss> nephish: exactly how do you sync a machine with ssh ?
[04:19] <realitychx> never heard of it?
[04:19] <realitychx> is it as simple?
[04:19] <darkroast> yes
[04:19] <darkroast> google it
[04:20] <realitychx> thanks will do
[04:20] <darkroast> are you using edgy
[04:20] <darkroast> not sure if it works on dapper
[04:20] <darkroast> but it definitely works on edgy
[04:20] <arrenlex> Hey, guys. I want to be able to make a file by redirecting the output, a la echo "foo" > /tmp/bar. Where would I put the sudo if I want to make it as root? sudo echo doesn't work.
[04:20] <realitychx> oooo
[04:20] <realitychx> using dapper
[04:20] <darkroast> k
[04:20] <darkroast> easyubuntu works well on dapper
[04:20] <realitychx> it did...
[04:21] <darkroast> did you break it?
[04:21] <darkroast> ;-)_
[04:21] <realitychx> all of a sudden its having repos issues
[04:21] <racarr> arrenlex: you could do 'sudo -s; echo "foo" > /tmp/bar; exit'
[04:21] <darkroast> hmm
[04:21] <darkroast> not sure 'bout that
[04:21] <peeps> if I add a user to a group by editing /etc/group then do I have to reboot to get the changes to take affect?
[04:21] <realitychx> not me ... i hope :-(
[04:21] <ablyss> peeps, no
[04:21] <arrenlex> racarr: Well yeah, but that's kind of hacky. Is there a bona fide way to do it?
[04:21] <nephish> ablyss_: with unison
[04:21] <crowley1027> how do i view .bin movies on linux
[04:21] <idlemind> arrenlex: just use 'su' ... still afk
[04:21] <arrenlex> crowley1027: What are bin movies?
[04:21] <ThePub> peeps: that user has to relogin to get the new group settings.
[04:21] <crowley1027> movie.bin
[04:21] <arrenlex> idlemind: That would work if the root account existed.
[04:22] <crowley1027> cue and bin
[04:22] <crowley1027> .cue .bin
[04:22] <arrenlex> crowley1027: I mean, what format? Run the command "file movie.bin"
[04:22] <arrenlex> crowley1027: Oh! That's a disc image.
[04:22] <peeps> ThePub: so if I want to run something in gnome, and I am logged in, I will need to Ctrl-Alt-Backspace?
[04:22] <arrenlex> crowley1027: like .iso. You burn them.
[04:22] <crowley1027> how do i view it on linux
[04:22] <ThePub> peeps: just log out and back in.  yes.
[04:22] <peeps> ok thx
[04:22] <nothlit> mplayer and vlc can do it
[04:22] <arrenlex> crowley1027: I'm assuming DVD. You can mount it as a loop device to get at the files, I guess.
[04:22] <nothlit> with vlc you have to pass it a command
[04:23] <arrenlex> crowley1027: Listen to nothlit. He knows what he's talking about.
[04:23] <nothlit> arrenlex, nah .bins and cues can't get mounted on loop without a compiled module thats not in the repos
[04:23] <arrenlex> nothlit: Really. I didn't know that. Weird.
[04:24] <nothlit> theres a convertor prog in the repos tho
[04:25] <crowley1027> hahaha
[04:25] <crowley1027> i saw "ctrl + alt + backspace" so i  tried it.
[04:25] <crowley1027> logs me out i see.
[04:25] <crowley1027> is there a codec to view .bin files on linux like i would a .mpg file
[04:25] <arrenlex> crowley1027: ctrl+alt+bksp restarts the X server.
[04:25] <crowley1027> heh
[04:25] <idlemind> back
[04:25] <jbroome> .bin isn't an encoding like mpeg, so no
[04:25] <ablyss> nephish: ty.  I'm still not sure why you can't ssh into machine 1 on port 22, ( from the outside ) then do it again i.e., ssh into machine 1 on port 22 then connect to machine 2 on port 23 while in machine 1.. thus having two ssh connections to do the unison
[04:25] <crowley1027> jbroome is there a way to view it on linux?
[04:26] <ablyss> logically, you can even leaven machine 2 on port 22
[04:27] <ablyss> oh ty for the unison .. i didn't know such a program existed and i really need to check it out
[04:27] <jbroome> crowley1027: 22:23 < nothlit> arrenlex, nah .bins and cues can't get mounted on loop without a compiled module thats not in the repos
[04:28] <ahattar> hi, anyone from new york knows about user group forum for Linux in general?
[04:28] <nephish> ablyss_: yeah, i was just wondering if there was an easier way, like specifying the port in the actual unison command., but thats ok, i can make this work. THanks for your help
[04:28] <Rupie> Does there exist such a beast as a java -> c\c++ translator? I think I read something about it somewhere once. Was I just asleep or...?
[04:28] <crowley1027> can i convert it?
[04:29] <dilch> i think ubuntu broked my internets
[04:29] <jbroome> it might be easier to just buy the movie
[04:29] <arrenlex> crowley1027: You could try burning it. It converting it to .iso and loopback-mouting it.
[04:29] <arrenlex> mounting*
[04:29] <ablyss> nephish: unison /home/username ssh://192.168.2.xx//home/username \  once you are in the internal network.. ports dont really matter :)
[04:29] <crowley1027> i would love to burn it if i had the capabilities.
[04:30] <crowley1027> with this POS i don't
[04:30] <nothlit> mplayer and vlc can do it
[04:30] <ablyss> theortically
[04:30] <nothlit> with vlc you have to pass it a command
[04:30] <dilch> i'll be needing help please, ubuntu broke my internets
[04:30] <nothlit> you should be able to use gmplayer and play it
[04:30] <ablyss> theoretically :P
[04:30] <arrenlex> dilch: Could you please be more specific?
[04:30] <nephish> yep, its working right now, thanks!
[04:30] <bobbie__4> arrenlex the tubes are all pluged up and the internets are clogged
[04:31] <nothlit> use vlc vcd://path/to/file.bin
[04:31] <arrenlex> bobbie__4: Oh. Tell your staff to stop sending you the internet.
[04:31] <nothlit> that should work
[04:31] <dilch> arrenlex, i plugged into my adsl modem like with windows but firefox or whatever didn't work
[04:31] <idlemind> crowley1027: what kind of data is on the .bin

[04:37] <dilch> ThePub, i know, it just felt nice to say it
[04:37] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: wget --help says it means "recursive".
[04:37] <Red-Sox> dilch: brings up the README
[04:38] <bobbie__4> dilch> you seem to be a very rude young man
[04:38] <bobbie__4> <bobbie__4> and you seem to be a windows troll
[04:38] <bobbie__4> <dilch> well, i'm a bsd troll
[04:38] <bobbie__4> <dilch> but hey, it's all the same ... mock ubuntu users
[04:38] <ThePub> Red-Sox: what it means is that if you give it, say an index or page of some sort with other links on it.  You'll get a recursive download of everything.
[04:38] <Red-Sox> oh ThePub
[04:38] <arrenlex> bobbie__4: What are you doing and why?
[04:38] <dilch> bobbie__4, what?

[04:49] <crowley1027> it's gibberish because i'm so used to windows.
[04:49] <sanityx> I can't seem to get fglrx working. I've installed it, and enabled it in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but I still have no 3D acceleration
[04:49] <tonyyarusso> nothlit: Maybe.  I wouldn't count on it though.  (Haven't checked too thoroughly myself)
[04:49] <crowley1027> can you just make our lives easier instead of having me go through all this and tell me the command(s) to get libdvdcss
[04:49] <tonyyarusso> crowley1027: If you can say which parts confuse you and why, people will know where to start.
[04:49] <DarkED> man wtf is up with this distro
[04:49] <idlemind> excuse me this might be slightly off-topic and old news but if any of you have lightscribe drives or are looking to buy one: http://www.lacie.com/company/news/news.htm?id=10293
[04:49] <DarkED> okay, im gonna try rebooting
[04:49] <DarkED> ill be back
[04:50] <crowley1027> tonyyarusso: tell me where i should start when i'm on this page.
[04:50] <nothlit> crowley1027, then you won't be able to do anything on your own
[04:50] <synchk> dilch: Goodbye. :)
[04:50] <ThePub> DarkED: I ask myself that every time I install it :p
[04:50] <tonyyarusso> crowley1027: We try to subscribe to the "teach a man to fish" idea when possible, that way you'll know more in the future and things will get easier.  (It's a learning curve, sure, but it's worth it.)
[04:50] <dilch> synchk, ciao :)
[04:50] <crowley1027> yeup
[04:50] <nothlit> you can either add seveas' repository to your sources.list or download the libdvdcss .deb and double click on that to install it
[04:50] <crowley1027> i see a couple command lines and server lists.
[04:50] <crowley1027> sources.ist
[04:51] <nothlit> yes if you choose the repo, you will have to choose a mirror, and add the key
[04:51] <crowley1027> which is easier?
[04:51] <syte> i tried to connect like the tutorial said "ssh (my public ip addr)"
[04:51] <M1> ok my friends...
[04:51] <M1> I think this warrants a victory song
[04:51] <jgedeon> crowely1027, what page are you looking at if you don't mind me asking.
[04:51] <crowley1027> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37861/
[04:51] <crowley1027> oh haha
[04:51] <crowley1027> hold on
[04:51] <dilch> syte, well you aren't going to be able to connect to your external ip address from your own machine
[04:51] <crowley1027> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[04:51] <tonyyarusso> !repos | crowley1027
[04:51] <ubotu> crowley1027: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[04:51] <M1> I JUST INSTALLED UBUNTU AND I AM USING LINUX FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
[04:51] <nothlit> installing the deb, but then you can't update easily, and if you ever want to do something like sudo aptitude install ~i it won't work
[04:52] <tonyyarusso> crowley1027: That will give you some background on what those lines mean I think.
[04:52] <msak007> congrats M1
[04:52] <msak007> welcome
[04:52] <dilch> syte, so you'll have to either get someone else to check for connectivity, or use an external shell etc
[04:52] <nothlit> reinstall ~i i mean
[04:52] <synchk> M1: What is your problem then?
[04:52] <M1> I'm computer savvy, but all work I did was with M$ oss
[04:52] <SilentDis> 'lo :)
[04:52] <syte> totally did not know that...lol...i feel retarded...but well...i decided it might work because i can usually check connectivity with apache through my own machine
[04:52] <M1> synch
[04:52] <syte> but o well...sorry
[04:52] <M1> I don't really have a problem, but I do have two questions
[04:52] <syte> and ty
[04:52] <synchk> M1: Oh.
[04:53] <M1> is there a way to launch gparted from within running os, or does it have to be from a live cd
[04:53] <SilentDis> M1:  ask away :)
[04:53] <M1> you guys freakin' rock
[04:53] <synchk> M1: You don't want to repartition a mounted disk.
[04:53] <nothlit> !gparted | MI
[04:53] <ubotu> MI: gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[04:53] <Crescendo> I have a bunch of MP3s that aren't labeled properly or not at all - what can I use to label them?  Perhaps according to filename?
[04:53] <syte> dilch, u mind checking my connection
[04:53] <crowley1027> m1: same here
[04:53] <syte> just to see if the login pops up
[04:53] <carutsu> hello
[04:54] <dilch> syte, yeah ... the ip you are on now?
[04:54] <syte> yes
[04:54] <ThePub> M1:  just install it (I don't think it's installed by default) and it'll show up under system -> administration
[04:54] <M1> seriously, i'm so happy
[04:54] <SilentDis> Crescendo:  you can edit labels in xmms... but there's gotta be an 'easy to use' script for it... i haven't found it either :P
[04:54] <carutsu> hello
[04:54] <carutsu> i'm having sound problems
[04:54] <Crescendo> SilentDis, yeah, exactly.  I'm using Rhythmbox, and looking for the same thing. ;)
[04:55] <tonyyarusso> Crescendo: Crud.  I'm absolutely blanking on the name.  I can tell you it exists, which is something.  Search for "mp3 tag editor" if noone else comes up with it.  Preferably with "apt-cache search keyword".
[04:55] <M1> cool, thanks ThePub
[04:55] <crowley1027> Ok...so someone has to help me.
[04:55] <M1> so it is possible to run it from hard-drive-installed Ubuntu then?
[04:55] <crowley1027> where do i download the libdvdcss
[04:55] <Crescendo> tonyyarusso, thanks. :)
[04:55] <ThePub> M1: of course.  gparted running from the CD is just running from an Ubuntu partition ;)
[04:55] <DarkED> okay, that didnt help
[04:55] <M1> sweet
[04:55] <dilch> syte, no dice ... i'll just run a quick nmap for port 22 on you
[04:56] <DarkED> X crashed at startup, i had to reconfigure it to use vesa
[04:56] <syte> kk
[04:56] <ThePub> M1: like *all* partition editors though, you cannot edit mounted partitions.
[04:56] <nothlit> tonyyarusso, cowbell?
[04:56] <crowley1027> i want to DOWNLOAD the actual file.
[04:56] <SilentDis> I'm actually looking for a 'conversion utility' that'll preserve ID3 tagging.  I have tons of hq MP3s, but my car/work CD MP3 players have a lot of trouble with MP3s that aren't 128CBR files :P
[04:56] <crowley1027> !cowbell
[04:56] <ubotu> cowbell: An easy-to-use tag editor for your music files. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.7.1-1 (edgy), package size 94 kB, installed size 548 kB
[04:56] <dilch> syte, yeah, you've got port 22 firewalled
[04:56] <syte> damn...i turned off the default firewall...
[04:56] <SilentDis> lol cowbell!
[04:56] <M1> .
[04:56] <tonyyarusso> Crescendo: Yeah, 'apt-cache search tag editor' has 36 results, maybe a dozen or so are useful.
[04:56] <syte> well firestarter
[04:56] <dilch> syte, are you using a front end for iptables?
[04:56] <syte> no
[04:57] <Crescendo> tonyyarusso, see, most of these are manual editors, though.
[04:57] <dilch> syte, well use firestarter to open port 22
[04:57] <carutsu> i have 2 problems: the sound embeded in flash is not sync with the video (neither in firefox nor in konqueror) and SuperKaramba crashes a lot!
[04:57] <tonyyarusso> Crescendo: Never tried it myself
[04:57] <syte> kk
[04:57] <Crescendo> I've got over 30,000 mp3s, any number of which are mislabeled... :/
[04:57] <DarkED> man what is goin on here...
[04:57] <M1> hey Pub
[04:57] <ThePub> CrescendoI think amarok does automatic naming, but don't quote me on that.
[04:57] <bjorner> What would I do if I'm a complete novice and my Synaptic Package Manager won't start?
[04:57] <M1> I looked in the add/remove, but I can't see gparted
[04:57] <crowley1027> tonyyarusso: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37864/
[04:58] <crowley1027> which one
[04:58] <carutsu> bjorner go to the terminal
[04:58] <carutsu> and u can instal any application by apt-get
[04:58] <jgedeon> crowely1027, have you read the wiki or the ubuntuguide?
[04:58] <_goofy_> in what order do i put te option's when mounting a hdd normaly when i mount a hdd i would do: type, dev, mount point  but where would i put a option
[04:58] <bjorner> with what? :-)
[04:58] <crowley1027> nope :)
[04:58] <tonyyarusso> crowley1027: libdvdcss2_1.2.9-0.0ubuntu4_i386.deb
[04:58] <carutsu> i dont know, what do you want to instal?
[04:58] <ThePub> M1: probably need to use synaptic :)
[04:59] <SilentDis> _goofy_:  anywhere.  I usually use the convention of mount /something /somewhere -t type -o options personally
[04:59] <Crescendo> ThePub, so do most other players, by the CDDB database - which isn't the best at figuring out what song it is.  Maybe I'm looking for some sort of MP3 signature comparison application?  It fingerprints the MP3, and compares it to a database somewhere?
[04:59] <syte> could u try once more please
[04:59] <bjorner> The updater says I have 175 updates pending
[04:59] <carutsu> nobody has any ideas for my problem/
[04:59] <nothlit> carutsu, please tell people to use aptitude, if not its a nightmare when they want to remove all of kde or xfce that they just happened to install
[04:59] <carutsu> ?
[04:59] <SilentDis> Crescendo:  there's a website with a tool that does it.  let me google a bit...
[04:59] <dilch> syte, ok
[04:59] <Parabola> hey guys, having a small issue with samba
[04:59] <syte> thx, i appreciate greatly :D
[04:59] <carutsu> nothlit im in ubuntu so i think they have apt-get otherwise would be kubuntu no?
[04:59] <Parabola> denied.)
[04:59] <Parabola> SMB connection failed
[04:59] <tonyyarusso> SilentDis: easyubuntu.freecontrib.org
[04:59] <Parabola> shit
[04:59] <nothlit> Crescendo, cowbell
[05:00] <M1> ok, I went to add/remove and under all I am not able to find gparted:(
[05:00] <jgedeon> crowley1027, your answer is in the those places in a step by step writing
[05:00] <_goofy_> silent dis.....thanks
[05:00] <nothlit> !aptitude | carutsu
[05:00] <ubotu> carutsu: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[05:00] <dilch> syte, you still have port 22 filtered
[05:00] <carutsu> but ok
[05:00] <Parabola> 12188: session setup failed: ERRDOS - ERRnoaccess (Access denied.) SMB connection failed
[05:00] <ThePub> Crescendo: I gave you as much of a hint as I can give :)  IDK, I tend to label all my music as I add it, if it doesn't already come with a good label.
[05:00] <carutsu> i knew that
[05:00] <Parabola> everyone is set to have access, any ideas?
[05:00] <M1> seriously guys, you have NO idea how psyched I am
[05:00] <syte> kk
[05:00] <carutsu> relax it'll be solved
[05:00] <carutsu> i have 2 problems: the sound embeded in flash is not sync with the video (neither in firefox nor in konqueror) and SuperKaramba crashes a lot!
[05:00] <nothlit> carutsu, all ubuntu desktop installs, probably even server installs should have aptitude and apt-get
[05:00] <M1> I mean, I've been using windows for YEARS
[05:00] <Crescendo> ThePub, yeah, so do I, but in a data transfer it seems they all got FUBARed, one way or another. :/
[05:01] <M1> hey ThePub
[05:01] <dilch> syte, hey join #syte
[05:01] <nothlit> !synaptic | MI
[05:01] <ubotu> MI: synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[05:01] <carutsu> nothlit: i didnt knew that, i though it was kde only
[05:01] <arrenlex> carutsu: Apropos the first problem, are you using flash 7 or 9?
[05:01] <M1> I can't find gpparted in the list for the life of me
[05:01] <carutsu> *didnt know sorry
[05:01] <carutsu> 7
[05:01] <dilch> syte, so i can tell you things that the kiddies won't latch on to
[05:01] <tonyyarusso> carutsu: For flash sound sync, blame flash.  The flash 9 beta 2 fixes that for some people.
[05:01] <M1> sorry, I'm a novice
[05:01] <carutsu> arrenlex: flash 7
[05:01] <ThePub> M1:  *points to what ubotu told you*
[05:01] <arrenlex> carutsu: Upgrade to 9.
[05:01] <nothlit> carutsu, no thats adept, and you can use synaptic in kde and adept in gnome
[05:01] <bjorner> I am reading this: http://www.pcmech.com/show/os/917/2/ about Synaptic but it won't work..
[05:01] <SilentDis> aargh, bbiab
[05:01] <carutsu> nothlit sorry! i confused them!
[05:01] <carutsu> arrenlex isnt too risky in a beta?
[05:02] <arrenlex> carutsu: ..."risky"? A multimedia plugin?
[05:02] <nothlit> flash9 is worth it, unless you have significant problems, but its been updated lately
[05:02] <carutsu> carutsu: i dont know anything with beta on it might be risky
[05:02] <karakara> anyone know how to test if your open gl is workin?
[05:02] <arrenlex> carutsu: You have significant demands of dependability from Flash?
[05:02] <M1> all right
[05:02] <nothlit> carutsu, most it can do is crash firefox
[05:02] <DigitalNinja> Can you do beryl on Dapper? I got it working on Edgy
[05:03] <M1> here's the dumbest question of the day
[05:03] <arrenlex> arrenlex: carutsu is talking to himself.
[05:03] <arrenlex> arrenlex: Yes he is. He's weird.
[05:03] <M1> (perhaps week)
[05:03] <arrenlex> arrenlex: Quite.
[05:03] <bjorner> If I go to System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager nothing happends (and yes I am Windowized with GUI)
[05:03] <M1> where do I type "(11:01:03 PM) nothlit: !synaptic | MI"
[05:03] <nothlit> DigitalNinja, yes, but you need to use xgl
[05:03] <carutsu> arrenlex no significant
[05:03] <M1> !synaptic
[05:03] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[05:03] <M1> i'm not that illiterate
[05:03] <DigitalNinja> nothlit: How do I get xgl
[05:03] <arrenlex> carutsu: Install flash 9. It's far better than 7.
[05:03] <ThePub> M1: system -> administration -> synaptic
[05:03] <carutsu> arrenglerx nothlit thank you
[05:03] <nothlit> DigitalNinja, wiki.beryl-project.com, they have good guides and explanations
[05:04] <ThePub> M1: administration is where many of the system-related software is listed in the gnome menu.
[05:04] <carutsu> arrenlex is it on adept pakages?
[05:04] <arrenlex> "arrenglerx" sounds like someone started saying my name and then choked on something.
[05:04] <ThePub> M1: preferences is for session/user specific stuff, for the most part.
[05:04] <DarkED> Okay, well... i'm getting 3D now, so thats fixed
[05:04] <arrenlex> !flash 9 | carutsu
[05:04] <ubotu> carutsu: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[05:04] <DigitalNinja> nothlit: Do you think it's better to switch to Edgy? I was going to stick with Dapper because of the long term support
[05:04] <carutsu> arrenlex sorry i just tried to type fast
[05:04] <jjazz> I haven't installed Ubuntu in a while.  A friend of mine somehow ended up in Dependency Hell while going from Dapper to Edgy.  He wants to reinstall but not lose the data in one of his partitions.  Does the current Dapper upgrade CD accomodate him?
[05:04] <arrenlex> DigitalNinja: Why do you need LTS?
[05:04] <jjazz> s/upgrade/install/
[05:05] <DigitalNinja> arrenlex: Just trying to be on the safe side. I use Linux for my business
[05:05] <carutsu> !backports
[05:05] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[05:05] <arrenlex> jjazz: He should come here and we can help him sort out his dependencies. :)
[05:05] <ThePub> jjazz: when you're installing, you'll only lose data on a partition you tell the installer to format.  iirc.
[05:05] <arrenlex> DigitalNinja: Ah. Okay.
[05:05] <M1> it's working!!!
[05:05] <M1> you guys ROCK
[05:05] <nothlit> DigitalNinja, if you want something particular from edgy, then switch (like if xgl is too slow and you need aiglx or nvidia, though you could install aiglx in dapper if you really wanted) otherwise stick to dapper, its more 'together'
[05:05] <jjazz> arrenlex: I'll recommend it.
[05:05] <nothlit> DigitalNinja, business? stick to dapper.
[05:05] <carutsu> M1 what your problem was?
[05:05] <jjazz> thanks
[05:05] <M1> you may not understand what I said 10 times already
[05:06] <M1> I'm rocking the linux box dudes!!!
[05:06] <carutsu> lol
[05:06] <nothlit> rofl
[05:06] <arrenlex> Gnarly.
[05:06] <M1> I almost feel like I'm cheating on my girlfriend
[05:06] <DigitalNinja> nothlit: OK! I've got an nvidia card. Should I use the nvidia stuff. I'm not sure what that is but I see it as an option in Edgy
[05:06] <DarkED> Okay, I get it now
[05:06] <DarkED> My master also doubles as my PCM now
[05:06] <DarkED> So as long as it stays at 50, I'm okay
[05:07] <mohlertm> Hello, how do i get some help....
[05:07] <nothlit> jjazz, your friend can remove all the apps and run apt-get with -f until he gets rid of everything (as long as you keep ubuntu-minimal, then just install ubuntu-desktop)
[05:07] <carutsu> nothlit i'm sorry i cant find it, would you mind giving me a hand?
[05:07] <arrenlex> !ask | mohlertm
[05:07] <ubotu> mohlertm: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:07] <M1> running my fingers gently accross my "linux box"
[05:07] <_goofy_> what option would i use to mount a filesystem so that anyone can read/write to the filesystem
[05:07] <M1> haha
[05:07] <ThePub> DarkED: I used to have a card like that, it was the card driver.
[05:07] <nothlit> carutsu, finding what?
[05:07] <jjazz> nothlit: That's an idea.
[05:07] <M1> ok, one more quick thing
[05:07] <bjorner> In access to not being able to start synaptics, I can't launch network config either
[05:07] <M1> I have a wireless modem
[05:07] <M1> with WPA protection
[05:07] <DarkED> ThePub: this is an older card, its an onboard SiS7018
[05:08] <nothlit> jjazz, the metapackage should handle everything
[05:08] <mohlertm> I am running Edgy (just installed)..how do i connect to my Windows XP Home computer on my network?
[05:08] <M1> does Ubuntu support wireless WPA protocol
[05:08] <nothlit> jjazz, you just need to get rid of all the dependency nonsense
[05:08] <carutsu> nothlit flash 9 i see i see libflash-mozplugin -swfplayer flashplayer-mozilla! too many choices but none of them says 9
[05:08] <M1> I have a Dell Laptop with wireless miniPCI card
[05:08] <bjorner> Machine loads "as if about to start program" then nothin'....
[05:08] <nothlit> !flash9 | carutsu
[05:08] <ubotu> carutsu: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[05:08] <arrenlex> !samba | mohlertm

[05:08] <M1> obviously I'm ok using wired connection
[05:08] <Hobbsee> M1: yes, with the network-manager-gnome

[05:09] <_goofy_> how do i mount a drive so anyone can read/write to it?
[05:09] <carutsu> i'm having problems
[05:10] <nothlit> !fstab | _goofy_
[05:10] <ubotu> _goofy_: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[05:10] <karakara> o rly

[05:10] <crowley1027> how do i open the sources.list file in terminal?
[05:10] <crowley1027> !sources

[05:10] <crowley1027> what command
[05:11] <arrenlex> crowley1027: "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"
[05:11] <arrenlex> crowley1027: Arrow keys to move around. ctrl+x to save and quit.

[05:11] <talbain> is there a boot command to specify the refresh rate?
[05:11] <arrenlex> cardanto1: ctrl+r
[05:11] <arrenlex> cardanto1: Or just history | grep <whatever>
[05:11] <arrenlex> cardanto1: Or the up key.
[05:11] <carutsu> nothlit finally after all this time in flash 7 we are going to flash 9, we are finally catching them up viva linux!
[05:11] <cardanto1> reverse-i-search?
[05:12] <arrenlex> cardanto1: Yes. It searches through your history. Start typing.
[05:12] <nothlit> carutsu,  :)
[05:12] <talbain> live cd gives me lines as if resolution or refresh rates are too high but changed resolutions with F4 and no go also choosing safe graphics mode
[05:12] <cardanto1> got it -- it found a match -- that's good -- i want another though -- how can i do that?
[05:12] <crowley1027> i added the seveas link to my sources.list, now how do i get libdvdcss
[05:13] <AngryElf_> where does thunderbird keep my preferences by default -- there is nothing inside ~/.mozilla
[05:13] <crowley1027> sudo apt-get install libdvdcss won't work
[05:13] <arrenlex> carutsu: If by "viva Linux" you mean "this just shows us ever more clearly that we are at the mercy of corporate players who decide whether or not they have anything to do with us out of nothing more than the goodness of their hearts", yes. Viva linux.
[05:13] <M1> hey all
[05:13] <arrenlex> crowley1027: You need to update your cache first. sudo apt-get update
[05:13] <M1> I downloaded network manager gnome
[05:13] <carutsu> lol
[05:13] <M1> but I cannot find it in any list
[05:13] <crowley1027> ooh :)
[05:13] <crowley1027> thx
[05:13] <M1> is reboot necessary?
[05:13] <crowley1027> then sudo apt-get install libdvdcss?
[05:14] <Falstius> talbain: I have a monitor that won't go above 640x480 and to get it to work with the live CD I have to use xrandr after logging in.
[05:14] <arrenlex> crowley1027: Yes. I think it's called libdvdcss2 actually.
[05:14] <crowley1027> k
[05:14] <nothlit> crowley1027, sudo aptitude update, and then its libdvdcss2
[05:14] <arrenlex> crowley1027: You can use "apt-cache search libdvdcss" to search for it.
[05:14] <carutsu> no actually it means "we are catching up them, linux is getting even better, allowing us to be on pair with other oses with corporative suport"
[05:14] <M1> oh, but the way I'M TOTALLY rocking thins LINUX box
[05:14] <cardanto1> exit
[05:14] <talbain> Falstius: this monitor goes upto 800x600 under windows
[05:14] <arrenlex> carutsu: We are not catching them, we are being given handouts when people feel sorry for us. But this conversation belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic.
[05:15] <crowley1027> whats the path to my desktop?
[05:15] <crowley1027> if the username is crowley1027
[05:15] <Gorillasmalls> can someone help me install compiz on my computer
[05:15] <talbain>  "/home/crowley1027/Desktop/"?
[05:16] <SilentDis> back again :)
[05:16] <crowley1027> so the command for playing the bin file would be... vlc dvd________________________
[05:16] <crowley1027> i don't know it.
[05:16] <carutsu> nothilt i think the future is open software although they try to stop us by the so called "trusted computing" i'm just more optimistic
[05:16] <talbain> is there a boot command to specify the refresh rate?
[05:16] <ungo> I'm having some problems using wine to run a program, would anyone mind giving me a hang?
[05:16] <talbain> live cd gives me lines as if resolution or refresh rates are too high but changed resolutions with F4 and no go also choosing safe graphics mode
[05:16] <arrenlex> ungo: "problems" is kind of vague.
[05:16] <SilentDis> quick question:  someone mentioned a way to 'backup' your current local .deb files for either archival purposes, or transfer to another machine.  could someone remind me of the tool to do this?
[05:17] <Slyboots_> Hi
[05:17] <arrenlex> !hi
[05:17] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[05:17] <crowley1027> nothilt: whats the command for opening the dvd?
[05:17] <crowley1027> the dvd file
[05:18] <crowley1027> @bye
[05:18] <Slyboots_> But.. the system settings have changed a lot!.. They were both downloaded at the same time...
[05:18] <crowley1027> !bye
[05:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bye - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:18] <crowley1027> lol
[05:18] <crowley1027> !goodbye
[05:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about goodbye - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:18] <Slyboots_> It makes me feel more importaint
[05:18] <Slyboots_> ;)
[05:18] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: You mean the default settings?
[05:18] <crowley1027> nothilt: what is the terminal command for watching DVDs with VLC?
[05:19] <nothlit> arrenlex, why are you telling people to use apt-cache search without --names-only?
[05:19] <stars> try gnome-open filename from the command prompt
[05:19] <Slyboots_> Like the Spell-check in MS word..
[05:19] <Slyboots_> Which just seems to be gone now..
[05:19] <crowley1027> nothilt: what is the terminal command for watching DVDs on VLC
[05:19] <arrenlex> nothlit: Apologies. I suppose I will recommend aptitude search now.
[05:20] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: I believe that is aslepp.
[05:20] <Falstius> crowley1027: vlc /dev/cdrom
[05:20] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: apt-get install aspell
[05:20] <compilerwriter> Is there a way via the miracle of linux to mount a device on another box on my home network and use it?
[05:20] <crowley1027> Falstius: the file is on my desktop
[05:20] <ungo> I get this error when trying to run a program with wine "err:module:import_dll Library EAX.DLL " anyone have an idea why?
[05:20] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: I meant to say aspell the first time too but my fingers decided they didn't like me.
[05:20] <nothlit> !aspell
[05:20] <ubotu> aspell: GNU Aspell spell-checker. In component main, is optional. Version 0.60.4-4 (edgy), package size 124 kB, installed size 1052 kB
[05:20] <nothlit> !smbfs | compilerwriter
[05:20] <ubotu> smbfs: mount and umount commands for the smbfs (for kernels >= than 2.2.x). In component main, is optional. Version 3.0.22-1ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 375 kB, installed size 900 kB
[05:20] <SilentDis> arrenlex:  nah.  grepping the packages.list file is the only way to go LOL
[05:20] <Falstius> crowley1027: then that's not a DVD .. is it an ISO or a couple of VOBs?
[05:20] <compilerwriter> BTW the other box is a Winblows machine
[05:20] <nothlit> !smbfs | compilerwriter
[05:20] <Slyboots_> aspell eh?
[05:20] <crowley1027> .Bin and .cue
[05:20] <compilerwriter> !smbfs
[05:21] <nothlit> anyways its a virtual filesystem for samba, windows networking basically
[05:21] <SilentDis> quick question:  someone mentioned a way to 'backup' your current local .deb files for either archival purposes, or transfer to another machine.  could someone remind me of the tool to do this?
[05:21] <Falstius> crowley1027: I hate those ... you might have to mount it but I'm not sure how.
[05:21] <Slyboots_> aspell is already the newest version.
[05:21] <crowley1027> if nothlit would answer me...
[05:21] <compilerwriter> so nothlit I could actually burn dvds from Minuet to the dvd drive on Mac?
[05:21] <crowley1027> nothlit: how do i open the file???
[05:21] <stars> crowley1027, cant you play the bin by selecting it from the gui?
[05:22] <crowley1027> stars: no
[05:22] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: aspell-en is also the newest version?
[05:22] <Slyboots_> yup
[05:22] <crowley1027> [00000294]  main private error: cannot re fill buffer
[05:22] <crowley1027> [00000278]  main playlist: nothing to play

[05:23] <nothlit> crowley1027, use vlc or (g)mplayer and dvd://
[05:23] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: Hmm.
[05:23] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: Oh. What about gnome-spell?
[05:23] <crowley1027> if the file is on my desktop, how do i write it.
[05:23] <Slyboots_> arrenlex: I'll try that now
[05:23] <crowley1027> dvd://home/crowley1027/Desktop/
[05:23] <crowley1027> ?
[05:23] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: That is my last guess. I don't even run gnome so I have no idea what I'm doing giving you advice about it.
[05:23] <nothlit> crowley1027, we are volunteers, and we don't have to respond right away you know
[05:23] <arrenlex> crowley1027: That would attempt to open the folder /home/crowley1027/Desktop/ as a DVD. I don't think that's what you want.
[05:23] <Slyboots_> arrenlex: already installed and latest version
[05:24] <crowley1027> *sigh*
[05:24] <nothlit> crowley1027, yeah, with the  File.bin afterwards
[05:24] <compilerwriter> I have one machine on my network that has a DVD burner.  My linux box could use samba to burn to it on another box?
[05:24] <arrenlex> Slyboots_: I don't know, then. Sorry. = /
[05:24] <ungo> arrenlex: I get the error "err:module:import_dll Library EAX.DLL " when trying to run a program with wine.  Not sure what to do about it
[05:24] <crowley1027> would the command be vlc dvd://home/crowley1027/Desktop/Mission To Mars/Mission To Mars.bin
[05:24] <Slyboots_> Doh :(
[05:24] <arrenlex> compilerwriter: No.
[05:24] <DarthLappy> crowley1027: You've gotta escape the spaces.
[05:24] <nothlit> crowley1027, try it
[05:24] <compilerwriter> I was afraid of that.
[05:24] <arrenlex> crowley1027: vlc dvd://home/crowley1027/Desktop/Mission\ To\ Mars/Mission\ To\ Mars.bin
[05:24] <crowley1027> [00000320]  vcdx access error: source name Mars.cue is not recognized as a CUE file

[05:24] <crowley1027> [00000278]  main playlist: nothing to play
[05:25] <stars> crowley1027, use \ then a space for the spaces in the filename
[05:25] <nothlit> crowley1027, rename the bin
[05:25] <nothlit> crowley1027, what we're doing is a hack, vlc is actually expecting a device
[05:25] <nothlit> crowley1027, name it to something with not spaces
[05:25] <compilerwriter> So I will have to run the file over via a thumb drive or something then? arrenlex
[05:25] <crowley1027> mission.bin and mars.cue?
[05:25] <nothlit> sure
[05:25] <arrenlex> nothlit: Hold on, I think his problem is that his spaces are unescaped. Look at the filename it printed: Mars.cue
[05:25] <crowley1027> done
[05:26] <crowley1027> mission.bin          mars.cue
[05:26] <crowley1027> and the folder is now Missionmars
[05:26] <Falstius> crowley1027: they should probably have the same name ..
[05:26] <SilentDis> I'd like to backup my apt-cache for archival purposes.  is there any way to do this, or shall I just copy over .deb files?
[05:26] <arrenlex> compilerwriter: Well technically, you could set something like SSH up, where you transfer the file to the mac and then burn it by command line.
[05:26] <crowley1027> k
[05:26] <mohlertm> I need to access some files on my xp home computer.  i have installed linux edgy 6.10 on this computer.  this puter is connected to my network.  How do i get to the files on my xp computer?
[05:26] <nothlit> arrenlex, oh, he used tab completion last time
[05:27] <ski-worklap> is there a nice gui sftp/scp program for gnome?
[05:27] <arrenlex> nothlit: Really. Why did it print Mars.cue then?
[05:27] <nothlit> !gftp

[05:28] <nothlit> crowley1027, use gmplayer then
[05:28] <ski-worklap> crowley1027, don't say "sorry in advance", used a pastebin
[05:28] <Parabola> I'm having an issue with chown, as root im getting "operation not permitted" on a mounted samba share
[05:28] <crowley1027> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37867/

[05:28] <nothlit> crowley1027, are you sure you installed libdvdcss2?
[05:28] <mohlertm> Yes they are.
[05:28] <crowley1027> nothlit: yes
[05:28] <arrenlex> Parabola: You don't chown shares. You have to pass them permissions at mount time.

[05:29] <crowley1027> bedtime!!
[05:29] <Parabola> arrenlex okay can you help with that

[05:29] <SilentDis> !samba | mohlertm
[05:29] <ubotu> mohlertm: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[05:30] <triplah_> i re call a friend telling me there was a oneliner to get a lamp setup on ubuntu
[05:30] <triplah_> anyone know what that is?
[05:30] <SilentDis> !lamp | triplah_
[05:30] <ubotu> triplah_: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[05:30] <triplah_> lovely thanks
[05:30] <mohlertm> ubotu - htat was way over my head......just getting started with linux.  are you saying I need to install Samba on my Edgy Machine?
[05:30] <SilentDis> triplah_ nt :)
[05:30] <Parabola> arrenlex: what options do i need to look into?
[05:30] <nothlit> SilenceGold, ehh he doesn't need a samba server, just smbfs or use gnomes libvfs
[05:31] <arrenlex> !ubotu | mohlertm
[05:31] <ubotu> mohlertm: I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[05:31] <arrenlex> Parabola: Mount it with umask=000 as an option
[05:31] <SilentDis> nothlit:  good point.
[05:31] <ski-worklap> is there a way to tell mount "use umask bla on directories" and umask foo on files ?
[05:31] <ski-worklap> basically the x bit on files makes me nervous, but i still need to change to directories obviously
[05:32] <SilentDis> mohlertm:  you should be able to install 2 apps, then just use nautilus to see your windows machine.
[05:32] <ski-worklap> considering i'm mounting from a windows machine
[05:32] <mohlertm> SilentDis: What 2 apps?
[05:32] <lucas9000> i'm trying to partition a hard drive as ext3 using gparted, but when i tell it to unmount the drive it says it can't because "most likely other partitions are also mounted on these mountpoints.  you are advised to unmount them manually"
[05:32] <lucas9000> any ideas?
[05:32] <SilentDis> mohlertm:  in a terminal window, type the following :  sudo apt-get install smbfs
[05:32] <ski-worklap> last time i changed umask in /etc/fstab (a few hours ago), then remounted, i got wacky ls output with a whole bunch of question marks in it
=== atlas is now known as Atlas_afk
[05:33] <triplah_> lucas9000, does mount tell you that anything is mounted there?
[05:33] <lucas9000> triplah: do you mean in terminal?
[05:33] <jfarrell> so whats the quickest way to refresh an IP
[05:33] <triplah_> lucas9000, yep
[05:33] <nothlit> lucas9000, use your desktop livecd and use gparted from there
[05:33] <jfarrell> i thought sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart would do it
[05:34] <Parabola> arrenlex: saying line is bad, i have //server/share /local path smbfs username=adsf,password=adsf umask=000
[05:34] <lucas9000> triplah: how do i do that?  sudo mount /media/sdb1 ?
[05:34] <SilentDis> mohlertm:  actually... that should be all you'll need, thinking of it...  once that command is done, just click places > network servers > windows Network, and you should see your windows machine :)
[05:34] <Parabola> arrenlex i also tried putting umask on the inside of user/pass section
[05:34] <arrenlex> Parabola: //server/share /local path smbfs username=adsf,password=adsf,umask=000
[05:34] <Parabola> ahh
[05:34] <Parabola> ty :)
[05:35] <arrenlex> Parabola: Oh, I should warn you that umask=000 gives 777 permissions. You might want to tone that down if that's too loose for you.
[05:35] <nothlit> or you can give it guest
[05:35] <nothlit> if theres no user/pass
[05:36] <arrenlex> Parabola: nothlit is ( I BELIEVE >=| ) talking to you.
[05:36] <jfarrell> hrmm
[05:36] <karakara> i always thought ubuntu would be quicker on this laptop than win2003 server, yet it seems the opposite is true
[05:36] <jfarrell> why isnt this machine getting an IP - the windows machine got it on the first try
[05:36] <nothlit> arrenlex, rofl you care more about whether my messages get to the right person than i do
[05:36] <nothlit> !dhcp | jfarrell

[05:37] <nothlit> hmm
[05:37] <lucas9000> triplah: you there?
[05:37] <karakara> dhclient eth0
[05:37] <jfarrell> nothlit, it doesnt come with it
[05:37] <karakara> perhaps
[05:37] <nothlit> karakara, you don't have to run gnome
[05:38] <jfarrell> i have to install a seperate program for my box to acquire an IP from a bridge that it is directly connected to?
[05:38] <karakara> hmm.. point..
[05:38] <lucas9000> nothlit: i will try the livecd...thanks
[05:38] <nothlit> no sorry, i expected there to be a dhcp factoid jfarrell
[05:38] <mohlertm> SilentDis: YOU ARE THE MAN!  I cannot believe the support for Linux.....I love this new machine.  one questions though.....it takes a while to open the folders on my xp machine...is that normal?
[05:38] <nothlit> jfarrell, the dhcp client should already be installed
[05:38] <triplah_> lucas9000, sorry. type "mount" in the terminal
[05:38] <SilentDis> How do i backup my /var/cache/apt/archives for archival and/or distrobution?  (got 2 machines running edgy, might as well have just 1 do the downloading)
[05:39] <jfarrell> nothlit, i just changed out the cables, the windows box was using the bridge, now I have the Linux box hooked up
[05:39] <jfarrell> but no internet access
[05:39] <karakara> i'd lovu to frick around with that 3d desktop thing that makes your workspaces switch around as cube faces
[05:39] <arrenlex> SilentDis: using the magic of tar?

[05:39] <lucas9000> triplah: ok...what am i looking for in this info it gave me?
[05:39] <Parabola> arrenlex: is umask=000 the most unrestrive as far as permissions go?
[05:39] <SilentDis> mohlertm:  other than the gender-mistake in there, thank you :)  it does take a bit to go back and forth through samba, i've noticed myself, but not horribly so :)
[05:39] <karakara> yeah.. just need to get that workin
[05:39] <arrenlex> Parabola: Yes. As I said, 777. Anyone can do anything. It is the wikipedia of permissions.
[05:40] <arrenlex> SilentDis: Be warned that /etc/apt/cache/archives does not represent the packages that are on your system.
[05:40] <arrenlex> SilentDis: in particular, you may have many older versions there.
[05:40] <SilentDis> arrenlex:  I thought of that, or just sharing out /var/cache/apt/archives via nfs, but I coulda swore there was a way to just backup what i've got and 'transport' it to another machine.
[05:40] <karakara> hu hu hu
[05:40] <arrenlex> SilentDis: the .debs?
[05:40] <SilentDis> arrenlex:  yeah... i guess it would be like creating a local repo of sorts
[05:40] <starz> right
[05:40] <starz> so im getting soft lockups
[05:41] <starz> and my cpu and disk access is spiking HARD
[05:41] <Digitalglitch> Hello I'm getting a error on boot of the live disk could somebody help me?
[05:41] <mohlertm> SilentDis:  "Your are the man" actually had no gender in mind :-)  It is used in both genders where I come from......just forgot I am not talking to people I know.  Thanks a lot for your help though.

[05:41] <starz> any clues as to what the heck that could mean?
[05:41] <arrenlex> SilentDis: I don't know enough about how dpkg works. Sorry.

[05:41] <starz> its running on a brand new 300 gig hdd using reiserfs
[05:41] <Digitalglitch> lol :P
[05:42] <lucas9000> well, there are 3 drives mounted in /media/
[05:42] <SilentDis> starz:  does fsck on the drive show anything?
[05:42] <lucas9000> triplah: is that what you mean by the same place?
[05:42] <starz> how do i do that
[05:42] <Digitalglitch> I'm getting a enturrput error and was woundering what it could be. it reboots the pc
[05:42] <starz> fsck /dev/hda  ??
[05:42] <SilentDis> starz:  you'll  need to reboot from your livecd before running fsck on the disk, of course
[05:42] <starz> while its running?
[05:42] <starz> oic

[05:42] <mohlertm> Silentdis: one more thing, I am trying to use VLC player to play my DVD's.  It actually closes itself when I click on the dvd and Okay.  I tried running it in the default movie player and it plays fine for about 10 minutes or so....any idea how I can fix it?
[05:42] <nothlit> SilenceGold, theres a apt cacher tutorial either on debuntu or debianadmin, it should be on debuntu
[05:43] <nothlit> SilentDis, , theres a apt cacher tutorial either on debuntu or debianadmin, it should be on debuntu
[05:43] <nothlit> SilentDis, if the other machine is not network accessible, theres apt-zip
[05:43] <SilentDis> nothlit:  got a link?  i could have sworn I searched around those :P
[05:43] <triplah_> lucas9000, maybe pastebin the output from "mount"  raf.net/paste
[05:43] <triplah_> er
[05:43] <Digitalglitch> Could it be a problem with usb port or a pci card? or ??
[05:43] <triplah_> lucas9000, rafb.net/paste
[05:44] <SilentDis> nothlit:  oh, both machines have access to shared network drive space.
[05:44] <nothlit> SilentDis: you're lucky it's in my browser history http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-set-up-a-repository-cache-with-apt-cacher
[05:44] <Parabola> arrenlex lol still getting owned
[05:44] <SilentDis> mohlertm:  I am actually having a VERY similar problem with that myself... then again, my PSU is failing, so I can't really diagnose if that's what's causing it on my machine or not :(
[05:44] <arrenlex> Parabola: ?
[05:45] <SilentDis> nothlit:  you rock, thanks :D

[05:45] <lucas9000> triplah: it's sdb1 that i'm trying to work with
[05:45] <gpd> is there a problem with the us.archive mirrors ? i am getting gzip errors?
[05:45] <jfarrell> anyone, is there a reason that when connected to a bridge that has been working fine with Windows, Ubuntu will only get an Ipv6 address for eth0
[05:46] <arrenlex> Parabola: a) what does your fstab line look like, b) have you remounted? c) Could you give me an ls -ld of the directory please?
[05:46] <nothlit> change it to archive.ubuntu.com gpd the us mirrors have caused a lot of problems lately
[05:46] <Digitalglitch> any way to look up the interrupt on my windows machine to see what the problem is when trying to boot ubuntu live?
[05:46] <gpd> nothlit: ok - thanks :)
[05:46] <nothlit> Parabola, have you used uid/gid?
[05:46] <mohlertm> Can anyone help to determine why VLC closes when i try to play dvd's and the "movie player" only plays the first 10 minutes or so and gives me a "read source error".  Any help on getting VLC to work?
[05:47] <nothlit> !alternate | Digitalglitch
[05:47] <ubotu> Digitalglitch: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[05:47] <nothlit> mohlertm, start vlc in the terminal and look at those errors, (also you can google them :) )
[05:47] <triplah_> lucas9000, so you are trying umount /dev/sdb1  ?
[05:47] <lucas9000> triplah: yes
[05:47] <nothlit> mohlertm, otherwise, you can use mplayer and ogle
[05:47] <Digitalglitch> ?
[05:47] <triplah_> lucas9000, ca you paste the exact output?
[05:48] <lucas9000> triplah: of what?  the gparted error message?
[05:48] <triplah_> lucas9000, can you type umount /dev/sdb1 in a terminal. and paste the message here
[05:48] <triplah_> if there is no message then it unmounted fine
[05:49] <lucas9000> triplah: "umount: /dev/sdb1 mount disagrees with the fstab"
[05:49] <we6jb1> I have a question
[05:49] <malv> is it possible to use nvidia raid with ubuntu?
[05:49] <we6jb1> Where can I go to paste code so that someone else can read it?
[05:49] <we6jb1> nm
[05:50] <triplah_> lucas9000, ok, now we are getting somewhere, type this in terminal: "grep sdb1 /etc/fstab"
[05:50] <lucas9000> triplah: ok, do you want me to paste the output of that?
[05:50] <triplah_> lucas9000, as long as it isnt more than 3 lines
[05:51] <triplah_> paste it here
[05:51] <triplah_> should be one or 2 lines
[05:51] <lucas9000> triplah: http://rafb.net/paste/results/AFEVS867.nln.html (just to be safe)
[05:51] <triplah_> ty
[05:51] <triplah_> lucas9000, ok, sudo gedit /etc/fstab  and comment out that line (put a # at the start of the line)
[05:51] <triplah_> save it and close gedit
[05:52] <triplah_> then try umount /dev/sdb1 again (in the terminal)
[05:52] <starz> i dont remember who it was but someone told me a minute ago to do fsck on my hdd?
[05:52] <starz> do i just do normal fsck or use fsck.reiserfs ?
[05:52] <nothlit> malv, yes, but you should make sure that particular raid controller is supported theres a linux-ata site
[05:52] <malv> is it worth the effort to do?
[05:53] <ski-worklap> starz, fsck just calls fsck.reiserfs
[05:53] <malv> are there large performance gains versus software raid?
[05:53] <starz> awesome logged in here via irssi doing fsck.reiserfs right now thanx ski-worklap
[05:54] <SilentDis> starz:  that was me :)  fsck will call fsck.reiserfs for you.  sudo fsck /dev/XdXX -C (replace the Xs with the proper info)
[05:54] <starz> ski-worklap: do i need to specify a partition or u SilentDis ?
[05:54] <ski-worklap> malv - actually in any cases software raid is faster
[05:54] <malv> ski-worklap, cool. I will go with software raid then
[05:54] <ski-worklap> if you have enough memory bandwidth, in particular, since your cpu will be much faster than the onboard risc processor on the raid board
[05:54] <lucas9000> triplah: it unmounted
[05:54] <ski-worklap> s/any/many/
[05:54] <lucas9000> triplah ftw!
[05:54] <SilentDis> starz:  what kind of HD (IDE or SATA), and what partition is it on?
[05:55] <malv> thank you both for your input
[05:55] <lucas9000> triplah: formatting it as ext3 in gparted now
[05:55] <starz> its ide root is hda2 i'm just doing: sudo fsck /dev/hda2 -C
[05:55] <triplah_> lucas9000, ok, well i think the automounter was conflicting with fstab. wierd. but at least you know how to get around it
[05:55] <carutsu> it worked!
[05:55] <carutsu> now its fine!
[05:55] <SilentDis> starz:  that will take care of it for you.  it'll show any errors and allow you to fix them.
[05:55] <lucas9000> triplah: so will i have to go back and change the fstab file in gedit after?
[05:56] <lucas9000> triplah: or do i just tell gparted to mount when it's done formatting?
[05:56] <starz> the hardware on this computer is old so it could also be going to its death: anything that i could look at as a cause? ~ errors no corruptions in root.. going to /home
[05:56] <triplah_> lucas9000, it depends what you make your partition. you may like to modify that line to reflect the changes you make
[05:56] <starz> @silentdis sorry
[05:56] <SilentDis> starz:  if you're curious, the -C option gives you a nice progress bar, so you can see it working :)
[05:56] <ski-worklap> starz, see if any ata messages are in dmesg
[05:56] <lucas9000> triplah: i'm obviously a noob...can i just leave the fstab alone now?
[05:56] <starz> ah lol. ok?
[05:57] <starz> !paste
[05:57] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:57] <triplah_> lucas9000, and to uncomment it. in general.... your ext3 line will be a lot simpler than that ntfs one.
[05:57] <mohlertm> Anyone: what is the easiest way for a new Edgy user (and i do mean new -- maybe 4 hours now) to get dvd's, .avi, .ram, and xvid media to play on my machine?
[05:57] <triplah_> lucas9000, well you probably want the line if you want it to automount when the computer boots up
[05:57] <SilentDis> starz:  i'm barely hanging on right now with a failing PSU myself :P  got a replacement one on it's way at least.  when a PSU dies, it'll either just kaput one day, or the machine will start crashing/kicking out random errors

[05:57] <ubotu> mohlertm: easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[05:57] <lucas9000> triplah: so should i just change it to match my other ext3 drive?
[05:57] <dilch> mohlertm, 2 answers; 1) boot windows (joke) 2) mplayer and codecs
[05:58] <triplah_> lucas9000, yeah, make sure you get the right /dev/foo and mount point etc :)
[05:58] <starz> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37869/ @ SilentDis thats after the fsc of /root partition...
[05:58] <dilch> personally i wouldn't touch easyubuntu with a 323 foot pole
[05:58] <Akuma_> what does it mean that i can't find a newer version of subverion in the repositories?
[05:58] <lucas9000> triplah: it's done formatting...now how do i mount it?
[05:58] <ski-worklap> dilch, well, it's an easy way to get mplayer with w32 codecs *shrug*
[05:59] <mohlertm> dilch: how do i get to the codecs.  when i play in mplayer it only plays the firs 10 minutes before it says "could not read from source"
[05:59] <dilch> ski-worklap, yeah, why not. Wasn't critisizing you personally
[05:59] <triplah_> lucas9000, mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1
[05:59] <smoked1> Does anyone know if there is a rapidshare client for linux?
[05:59] <ski-worklap> starz, that looks fine. no kernel indication of impending hd failure
[05:59] <dilch> mohlertm, well that's not a codec problem then
[05:59] <SilentDis> !rapidshare
[05:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rapidshare - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:59] <dilch> mohlertm, you are saying it actually plays it fine then quits?
[06:00] <lucas9000> triplah: can i do mount /dev/sdb1 /storage2 to make it more consistent with my current ext3 drive?
[06:00] <triplah_> lucas9000, change your line in fstab to look like this "/dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1     ext3    defaults,umask=007,gid=46 0       1"
[06:00] <triplah_> lucas9000, yep of course
[06:00] <ski-worklap> mohlertm, what are you trying to play? a video file? an audio file? a network stream?
[06:00] <triplah_> make the change in the fstab line too
[06:00] <SilentDis> starz:  i didn't see anything odd in that dmesg output
[06:00] <starz> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37870/ and thats the new one SilentDis
[06:00] <mohlertm> dilch: Yes, about 10 minutes in.  HOWEVER, it won't play any of my .avi files i have downloaded.
[06:00] <smoked1> nothing in factoids for rapidshare
[06:01] <CarCase928> how to i type in Chinese?
[06:01] <lucas9000> triplah: mount: mount point /storage2 does not exist
[06:01] <dilch> mohlertm, well you probably do need the codecs. Follow ski-worklap's worthy advice and use easyubuntu
[06:01] <starz> both partiitons came up clean. but i was noticeing spikes in cpu and hard spikes in the hdd. the hdd is brand new so i doubt that would be the culprit. any other hardware that could contribute to something like this ?
[06:01] <mohlertm> ski-worklap:  i am trying to play a reagular dvd on my dvd rom drive and tried to play a .avi file i downloaded.  Both failed in VLC.
[06:01] <triplah_> lucas9000, mkdir /storage2
[06:01] <starz> @ SilentDis sorry again sigh
[06:01] <dilch> mohlertm, personally i use ogle to play my dvds
[06:01] <ski-worklap> mohlertm, definitely give mplayer a spin - it supports just about any codec there is
[06:01] <starz> i have been running etch and im about to downgrade to dapper right now to see if i get the same thing.
[06:02] <SilentDis> starz:  hehe no worries...  what is exactly happening, just random crashes?
[06:02] <lucas9000> triplah: ok it looks like that worked
[06:02] <starz> i'll be doing whatever like running azureus or watching a vid and it will freeze up randomly
[06:03] <ski-worklap> starz, the whole computer or just the video app?
[06:03] <starz> its not been crashing but i'm starting to wonder if my cpu is about to die or something SilentDis
[06:03] <starz> ski-worklap: depends:
[06:03] <SilentDis> starz:  did you build the 'puter yourself?
[06:03] <ski-worklap> err, i think i got my people confused
[06:03] <Pelo> starz,  you hit the nail ,  az uses ungodly amounts  or memory
[06:03] <Pelo> of memory
[06:03] <mohlertm> ski-worklap:  when i righ click and open my .avi file with mplayer it gives me the following error.."Could not read from resource."
[06:03] <starz> i can move mouse around but anything else lags and programs stop. so the whole thing except for the mouse can be moved
[06:03] <lucas9000> triplah: so do i change that line in my fstab to "/dev/sdb1 /storage2     ext3    defaults,umask=007,gid=46 0       1"?
[06:04] <starz> Pelo: az doesnt need to be running for this to happen. i can be watching say the latest capeta from a-e which is no major strain on the system and it still does it.
[06:04] <triplah_> lucas9000, yeah that should do it for now :)
[06:04] <SilentDis> starz:  random crashes are REALLY hard to pin down.  are you running beryl/compiz?  age of the machine?
[06:04] <knapp> Anyone here know how I can add a codec to ffmpeg? For instance when I try to encode it says "Unknown codec aac"
[06:04] <lucas9000> triplah: one last thing...but my previous ext3 drive is just "/dev/sdc1 /storage ext3 defaults 0 0" in fstab...?
[06:04] <starz> not running beryl compiz: amd 3000+ gig ram nvidia fx5200 vid card soundblaster audigy 2 sound card
[06:04] <triplah_> lucas9000, then once that entry is in fstab it should mount when the computer starts. and you can type mount /storage2 to get it mount
[06:05] <starz> vid and sound card are both from 2002 and comp is about 1.5 yrs old.
[06:05] <CarCase928> is there a way to type in Chinese? i found the way to do it on Windows, but i would like to do it on Ubuntu, how do i do it?
[06:05] <triplah_> lucas9000, yeah thats fine too. the gid and stuff is just permissions.... you ca get rid of them if you like
[06:05] <orca> is anyone here about to help out with spdif output problems on an audigy 2?
[06:05] <triplah_> lucas9000, but leave them for now
[06:05] <lucas9000> triplah: tyvm
[06:05] <triplah_> nps :)
[06:05] <starz> i think the guy i got the mobo/cpu/ram from tried to overclock it mebbie? so this could be final instability before death?
[06:05] <lucas9000> triplah: have a good night
=== ariel is now known as newwwbie
[06:05] <starz> ive watched cpu temps and stuff and it seems to be running like a champ and ive not got it overclocked at all
[06:05] <triplah_> Tue Dec 19 15:06:03 EST 2006
[06:06] <triplah_> :)
[06:06] <triplah_> you too lucas9000
[06:06] <starz> wel while we talk i'll install breezy ~_~
[06:06] <starz> is there a way to do a server install while on irssi? and if not is there irssi on the server install disk ?
[06:06] <carutsu> now that i've solved the flash problem, anybody of you have problems with SuperKaramba
[06:06] <starz> ive got the livecd running dapper atm
[06:06] <carutsu> it deletes what i downloaded and crashes a lot
[06:07] <SilentDis> starz: I'll give you my situation, so you can see where I'm coming from on this.  my machine is around 5 years old now (built it heavy when I built it) so it still does most of what I need, and still plays most modern games.  I've upgraded it over and over, but never changed out the psu.  it's got a 400w psu, that's been going for that whole time.  It's trying to power an AMD processor, 2 HDs, 2 CD drives, a modern vid card, and TONS of s
[06:07] <starz> and for the record running from the live cd i get like no cpu spikes or anything..
[06:07] <SilentDis> tuff in the PCI bus.  add in that i'm a smoker, so the PSU is probably in bad shape.  I've started getting random crashes, until now, it was 'bearable'.  At this point, it's nearly on it's deathbed.  I borrowed a friends 500w psu, and all my crashes went away.  it was the only bit I hadn't upgraded in that time lol
[06:07] <rixth> mdadm has said my RAID1 array has degraded. http://pastebin.ca/284643 << what /proc/mdstat says. What does that mean, and whatdo I do about it?
[06:08] <CarCase928> !Asian
[06:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Asian - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:08] <starz> SilentDis: my ps is 500w and i have 2 hdd's and cdrom and dvd drive
[06:08] <starz> sound and vid card and thats about it. i should have plenty of power to spare but i'm with ya..
[06:08] <ski-worklap> rixth, probably buy a new hard drive
[06:08] <Pie-rate> how would I encrypt and password protect a directory?
[06:09] <Pie-rate> without using tar and mcrypt
[06:09] <starz> when a vid card is ready to die will it ever do hard power usage spikes SilentDis ?
[06:09] <SilentDis> starz:  I ended up buying a 680w PSU, just so I could cart it with me when I finally build a new box hehe
[06:09] <ski-worklap> or if you feel like living dangerously, rebuild onto the failing drive to get redundancy for a little bit longer
[06:09] <CarCase928> !wine
[06:09] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[06:09] <ski-worklap> but that's a bad idea for lots of reasons
[06:09] <rixth> ski-worklap, wouldn't it more likely be bad sectors?
[06:09] <zhugeL> how to check the temperature of cpu
[06:09] <rixth> ski-worklap, the drive is under warranty
[06:09] <starz> oooooooooo can i check hdd for bad sectors?
[06:09] <rixth> er, drives
[06:09] <ski-worklap> rixth, modern drives remap bad sectors
[06:09] <Pie-rate> is there a graphical utility to encrypt and password protect a directory?
[06:10] <ski-worklap> so if you've used all the drives spare sectors, it's on its way to failling
[06:10] <rixth> These are Western Digital drives, I'd doubt that they would fail after only 4 months?
[06:10] <ski-worklap> maybe 2 days, 2 months, 2 years
[06:10] <ski-worklap> the brand means nothing, as anyone who bought good ol; reliable ibm deathstars can tell you
[06:10] <SilentDis> starz:  the only way to truely 'diagnose' power problems is to get a pc repair kit that monitors such stuff.  I have seen them, but they're pricy, and it's just easier to swap stuff till you see the problem go away.  I'd almost recommend 'borrowing' a friends comperable vid card (either ATI or nvidia) and see what happens for an hour or 2.
[06:11] <Pie-rate> is there a graphical utility to encrypt and password protect a directory, and is there a way to get a menu option in nautilus to shred a file?
[06:11] <starz> sigh.

[06:11] <rixth> ski-worklap, how would I rebuild onto the 'bad' drive?
[06:12] <starz> and this comes at a time where i just got rear ended today. i was going to buy a new computer next month but now that looks unattainable for a while
[06:12] <ski-worklap> rixth, i'm not familiar with the details of md, although i've done it with hardware controllers and vinum on freebsd
[06:12] <rixth> I'll get WD's diagnostic checky thing. See what happens.
[06:12] <ski-worklap> trust me when i say, you really don't want to risk it
[06:12] <ski-worklap> those are dern near worthless
[06:12] <ski-worklap> see if you can access the SMART data
[06:12] <starz> well im going to boot from server install disk and if its got irssi i'll be back right away if not i got to get x-window-system gdm and gnome-core in first
[06:12] <SilentDis> starz:  I REALLY understand that one.  I'm trying to buy christmas gifts and I had no choice but to 'splurge' on myself just to maintain my livelihood at this point lol
[06:12] <rixth> I am going to get the drives under warranty, but most places have closed for Christmas now.
[06:12] <starz> SilentDis: heh yeah
[06:12] <orca> orca
[06:13] <starz> ok bbiab and thanx lots SilentDis
[06:13] <ski-worklap> rixth, don't rebuild onto a failed drive. forget i ever said that. run on one drive until after xmas
[06:13] <orca> woops :P
[06:13] <ski-worklap> err s/one/n-1/
[06:13] <starz> install should only take like what... 30 min max
[06:13] <starz> o yeah
[06:13] <SilentDis> starz:  for now, I limp along and reboot every hour or so :P
[06:13] <starz> damn
[06:13] <starz> that hurts
[06:13] <rixth> ski-worklap, do you know the command for getting the SMART data?
[06:13] <CarCase928> gimpshop
[06:13] <starz> btw i noticed that my computer doesnt use my swap at all
[06:14] <CarCase928> !gimpshop
[06:14] <ubotu> gimpshop is a hack that makes The Gimp look and feel more like Photoshop.  A .deb for Ubuntu is available via http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294
[06:14] <starz> can i just take out swap and say to heck with it?
[06:14] <SilentDis> starz:  that's normal.  I'm running 1.25gb, and it rarely swaps heh
[06:14] <starz> typically uses around 30MB :/ of 2 gigs
[06:14] <starz> yeah gig ram here
[06:14] <starz> any good reason to leave more than a half gig swap partition?
[06:14] <SilentDis> starz: no, don't do that... trust me, when you need it, and it's not there... it'll be BAD
[06:14] <starz> o.o
[06:14] <ski-worklap> rixth, this looks good - smart-notifier - graphical hard disk health status notifier
[06:14] <starz> right......
[06:14] <Pie-rate> is there a graphical utility to encrypt and password protect a directory, and is there a way to get a menu option in nautilus to shred a file?
[06:15] <rixth> This is a command line only machine
[06:15] <SilentDis> starz:  swap = 2.5 * Physical Ram is usually a good formula :)
[06:15] <curs0r> i'm using 7.5/4096
[06:15] <ski-worklap> SilentDis, not really, you can just add a swapfile
[06:15] <starz> lol
[06:15] <rixth> smartmontools looks good.
[06:15] <starz> the rule is 2xram to 1 gig and .5 of overages
[06:15] <starz> so 2 gigs is 1.5
[06:15] <starz> but i use rule of two anyway... 2.5 though????
[06:15] <starz> damn thats a lot.. why so much?
[06:15] <SilentDis> ski-worklap:  very true... but if you're in the middle of a deathmatch in Doom3 with your mp3's playing and it uses up.... lol
[06:15] <bulmer> swap is good perhaps if you know how to read dumps? but since very few do, ummm swap space is it really useful?
[06:15] <syte> I greatly appreciate it delich
[06:16] <keegan> anyone know how I can embed gxine into mozilla with mozplugger?
[06:16] <syte> dude...thx for spending 4 hours helping me
[06:16] <syte> :D
[06:16] <ski-worklap> rixth, smartmontools
[06:16] <ski-worklap> bulmer, umm, are you kidding?
[06:16] <rixth> 'Device does not support SMART' damn.
[06:16] <SilentDis> starz:  easy, disk space is cheap... well... rather cheap.  I think i've actually got a 5gb swap partition on this 'puter rofl
[06:16] <starz> o.o
[06:16] <Pie-rate> is there a graphical utility to encrypt and password protect a directory, and is there a way to get a menu option in nautilus to shred a file?
[06:16] <Arithmomaniac> Hello
[06:16] <SilentDis> starz:  between the 2 drives in it, I've got 400gb of storage space rofl
[06:16] <bulmer> ski-worklap: no, just my opinion.
[06:16] <starz> thats the biggest swap partition i ever heard of....
[06:16] <Arithmomaniac> I'm a new user trying ot use Ubuntu
[06:17] <starz> yeah i got 300 on this one 200 on the other...
[06:17] <ski-worklap> it's good for hibernation, and it's good for ... wait for it ... "swapping" ! (altho technically it's not swapping)
[06:17] <corevette> should i upgrade all my apps to ubuntu3.2??
[06:17] <starz> anyway im gonna boot into server install bbiab
[06:17] <starz> ~~
[06:17] <Arithmomaniac> Is there any way to autoconfigure an internet connection?
[06:17] <Arithmomaniac> You know, like Windows or DSL
[06:17] <Arithmomaniac> It's already set to DHCP
[06:17] <bulmer> ski-worklap: me culpa..i was getting it confused with core dump..ek
[06:17] <Pie-rate> Arithmomaniac: it should work already
[06:17] <Arithmomaniac> It doesn;t
[06:18] <Kachingo> Howdy, is there a way that I can have ubuntu not show the loading screen when it starts up, but show the command line instead?
[06:18] <ski-worklap> Arithmomaniac, system -> administration -> network tools
[06:18] <nelsonuwp> can anyone help me with some beginner linux questions?
[06:18] <corevette> should i upgrade all my apps to ubuntu3.2??
[06:18] <Arithmomaniac> Yeah, but I can't even ping
[06:18] <syte> arithmomaniac, it should
[06:18] <syte> have automatically configured when u installed
[06:18] <Arithmomaniac> Maybe I'm missing a driver?
[06:18] <ski-worklap> bulmer, ah, yea. core dumps are pretty pointless for 99.9% of folks
[06:18] <SilentDis> !anyone | nelsonuwp - any of us can, that's why we're here... and...
[06:18] <ubotu> nelsonuwp - any of us can, that's why we're here... and...: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[06:18] <Arithmomaniac> OK
[06:18] <nelsonuwp> k, well im debating about completely switching from windows to linux
[06:18] <Arithmomaniac> THanks
[06:19] <zxccvb> how to find my own IP on ubuntu?
[06:19] <Pie-rate> zxccvb: ifconfig
[06:19] <corevette> nelsonuwp, its worth the change, i'm 16 and i got used to it in a week
[06:19] <ski-worklap> nelsonuwp, what's to debate? :)
[06:19] <bulmer> ifconfig -a or ip addr show eth0  assuming your nic is eth0
[06:19] <corevette> nelsonuwp, you'll never go back
[06:19] <Pie-rate> zxccvb: or system->administration->network tools
=== bimberi_ is now known as bimberi
[06:19] <nelsonuwp> so first what are the differences between the ubuntu versions, xubuntu, edubuntu, and kubuntu?
[06:20] <syte> i just have to get cedega installed then i'm set :D
[06:20] <ski-worklap> nelsonuwp, if you don't know, just get plain ubuntu
[06:20] <SilentDis> corevette:  i run a mainly ubuntu machine now.  windows is still there on it's own partition... but I haven't booted it in months
[06:20] <Snowman108> is it possible to run quickbooks pro under linux?
[06:20] <bimberi> Kachingo: try removing "splash" from the appropriate kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[06:20] <ski-worklap> xubuntu is optimized for old slow hardware
[06:20] <SilentDis> syte:  cedega ROCKS ;)
[06:20] <ski-worklap> edubuntu is for educational instituttions
[06:20] <corevette> is cadega free silentdis?
[06:20] <bulmer> Snowman108: i assume its a windows app? you can run vmware then run that app on vmware
[06:20] <syte> is there a debian pack for it
[06:20] <SilentDis> !wine | Snowman108
[06:20] <ubotu> Snowman108: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[06:20] <syte> or will i have to compile from source... :(
[06:20] <ski-worklap> kubuntu is just ubuntu with kde instead of gnome, but since most people have gnome where you'll be asking for help (read: here), use gnome
[06:21] <Kachingo> bimberi: Thank you. Actually, is it possible to change the colour settings for the splash?
[06:21] <nelsonuwp> k
[06:21] <SilentDis> corevette:  no, but it's cost is trival.  all of $15 to start (3 month sub).  all of $5/month :)
[06:21] <Snowman108> ok I will try it... thanks
[06:21] <bimberi> Kachingo: that I don't know but there is ...
[06:21] <Pie-rate> is there a graphical utility to encrypt and password protect a directory, and is there a way to get a menu option in nautilus to shred a file? i've been asking this for like half an hour and i can't believe no one in this channel has ever had critical data or has bothered to protect said critical data
[06:21] <bimberi> !usplash | Kachingo
[06:21] <ubotu> Kachingo: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[06:22] <ski-worklap> speaking of splash screens... is there a way to get grub to display something a bit more graphical and nicer?
[06:22] <Kachingo> bimberi: Woo! Just what I've been looking for, thanks
[06:22] <ski-worklap> i know solaris uses grub, and it looks worlds nicer
[06:22] <bimberi> Kachingo: cool, np :)
[06:22] <ski-worklap> i don't much care but i share this laptop with my boss
[06:22] <gpd> where do I find realplayer these days? it isn't in medibuntu?
[06:22] <SilentDis> ski-worklap:  yes, you can add bitmaps and such to it.  check the grub help page
[06:22] <x-r00t-x> \003
[06:22] <SilentDis> !grub | ski-worklap
[06:22] <ubotu> ski-worklap: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:23] <arrenlex> gpd: Reaplayer is evil. Free players can play realmedia files with w32codecs.
[06:23] <Kream> hi all
[06:23] <arrenlex> !hi
[06:23] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:23] <SilentDis> !hi
[06:23] <gpd> arrenlex: mplayer etc ?
[06:23] <ski-worklap> arrenlex, that's not comletely true
[06:23] <arrenlex> gpd: Especially mplayer.
[06:23] <arrenlex> ski-worklap: 'splain?
[06:23] <zxccvb> how to find IP using ubuntu
[06:23] <ski-worklap> live.com has gotten better but it's still a ways from perfect
[06:24] <arrenlex> zxccvb: /sbin/ifconfig
[06:24] <zxccvb> it gives 127.0.0.1 for me.which is not useful
[06:24] <Railer> hey i have weird problem, ff is not getting out after putting on a new router, it worked fine on the old router, but I can still ping locally no problem, and other computers can get out no problem, any suggestions?
[06:24] <nelsonuwp344> i got disconnected
[06:24] <arrenlex> zxccvb: whatismyipaddress.com
[06:24] <CarCase928> is there a way to run MAC software and open MAC files on Ubuntu?
[06:24] <hendrickvp> Hey Guys! I can not access mysql through the MySQL Admin. Tool, bind-address is set to 0.0.0.0 any sugestions
[06:24] <SilentDis> !mac
[06:24] <nelsonuwp344> I got the ubuntu cd and then I can just install it clean on my laptop?
[06:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mac - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:24] <Pie-rate> arrenlex: almost everyone is NATted these days
[06:25] <syte> does cedega run cs well?
[06:25] <cge> Does anyone know why Evince would ignore my DPI settings? I have a 124.1 dpi monitor, and it is set as such in xorg.conf and in gnome-font-properties, but it appears that Evince ignores that and thinks that the screen is 75dpi, making "100%" completely wrong. Am I not setting the DPI in the right place?
[06:25] <Pie-rate> zxccvb: ignore arrenlex's suggestion to use whatismyipaddress.com unless you know you aren't behind a NAT (network address translation) firewall. almost everyone is
[06:25] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  I know you can mount udf floppies and cds under ubuntu, and depending on the file, linux should be able to read them...
[06:25] <curs0r> cge, how's that monitor look?
[06:25] <rixth> ski-worklap, what are the risks of rebuilding onto the 'failed' disk?
[06:25] <Pie-rate> zxccvb: or unless you want your external ip address
[06:26] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  as for mac emulation for apps (like wine for windows stuff)... not sure of any such tools :P
[06:26] <zxccvb> yeah..i want external ip
[06:26] <arrenlex> cge: em@sam:~$ cat ~/.Xresources
[06:26] <arrenlex> Xft.dpi: 96
[06:26] <arrenlex> cge: help?
[06:26] <arrenlex> cge: i.e. does that help?
[06:26] <CarCase928> ok, thanks
[06:26] <cge> curs0r: The fonts look quite nice. It is on a laptop, so it is an LCD and has subpixel rendering down to around 300 dpi horizontal.
[06:26] <atroWork> My ssh session times out very frequently (like after maybe 5 minutes of no use?) when connecting from my work computer (edgy) to my home computer (dapper). Is this a configuration setting on server side? client side? some unknown problem?
[06:27] <CarCase928> !help | CarCase928
[06:27] <ubotu> CarCase928: I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[06:27] <cge> arrenlex: I have Xft.dpi: 124 in there, but it doesn't help.
[06:27] <hendrickvp> I can not access mysql through the MySQL Admin. Tool, bind-address is set to 0.0.0.0 any ideas?
[06:27] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  if you can give me a moment, I can poke around and see what's there for mac emulation...
[06:27] <arrenlex> cge: Oh. Dunno then.
[06:27] <CarCase928> SilentDis: ok
[06:27] <ubuntu_> is there someone
[06:27] <Pie-rate> is there a graphical utility to encrypt and password protect a directory, and is there a way to get a menu option in nautilus to shred a file? hooray everyone is ignoring me! i need a hug :(
[06:27] <bulmer> hendrickvp: where is your mysql admin at? on same machine?
[06:28] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  specifically, what app were you trying to run?
[06:28] <hendrickvp> bulmer: no another machine
[06:28] <cge> In general, Evince actually seems really horrible. It also ignores subpixel rendering and hinting settings for fonts. I'll have to take a look at the source, file bugs, and write some patches.
[06:28] <Kream> hi all
[06:28] <ubuntu_> can soneone tell me form where i can download zimbra nntp
[06:28] <bimberi> Pie-rate: not ignoring, just don't know :)
[06:28] <Pie-rate> ubotu, tell kream about hi
[06:28] <atroWork> hendrickvp, is skip-networking uncommented? (it shouldn't be if you're connecting from anywhere but local machine). I believe that was replaced with the bind-address directive, but I've seen configs with both for some reason, I swear
[06:28] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  because many of the 'base' tools are now the same (seeing that OS X is based upon BSD)
[06:28] <Kream> Pie-rate:  sorry, something is wrong with my X - been playing around with skim triggers and xchat keeps crashing
[06:28] <bulmer> hendrickvp: is that user allowed to connect to your mysql based on its ip address?
[06:29] <Railer> hey i have weird problem, ff is not getting out after putting on a new router, it worked fine on the old router, but I can still ping locally no problem, and other computers can get out no problem, any suggestions?
[06:29] <ubuntu_> HEY SOMEONE TO TELL FROM WHERE I CAN GET ZIMBRA NNTP
[06:29] <hendrickvp> atroWork: I read a blog, where some one had mention that where is the file?
[06:29] <Pie-rate> !caps
[06:29] <ubotu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[06:29] <SilentDis> !caps
[06:29] <ubuntu_> Silentdis tell me man
[06:29] <bun-bun> anyone running vmware?
[06:29] <ubuntu_> yes i
[06:29] <hendrickvp> bulmer: ?
[06:29] <bun-bun> running xp in it?
[06:29] <ubuntu_> but from Windows
[06:29] <SilentDis> ubuntu_: i've never herd of that app, sorry.
[06:30] <bun-bun> wow backassward
[06:30] <cge> ubuntu_: one moment
[06:30] <ubuntu_> no From Windows
[06:30] <SilentDis> !zimbra
[06:30] <hendrickvp> bulmer: user I'm using is root.
[06:30] <ismail> hi guys
[06:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about zimbra - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:30] <ubuntu_> cge man please
[06:30] <atroWork> hendrickvp, default is /etc/mysql/my.cnf I believe
[06:30] <nelsonuwp344> so how do the apps compare in linux compared to xp?
[06:30] <nelsonuwp344> word, excel and whatnot?
[06:30] <bulmer> hendrickvp: is root allowed to get into mysql via that ip address?
[06:30] <bun-bun> anyone using vmware to run xp?
[06:31] <DarthLappy> bun-bun: I have done it. What's up?
[06:31] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  I see a couple mac OS9 emulators out there for linux, but that's about it
[06:31] <bulmer> bun-bun i have been testing it recently
[06:31] <hendrickvp> bulmer: I don't know I have only changed the bind-address
[06:31] <ubuntu_> cge man
[06:31] <cge> nelsonuwp344: I use Word and Excel in Linux. They actually work quite well with Crossover. Openoffice works, but feels rather clunky. Of course, for nice typesetting, LaTeX is far better.
[06:31] <rixth> ski-worklap, I'm thinking it may have just been a read/write interrupted by a power glitch, I'm rebuilding and will be watching it closely.
[06:31] <atroWork> bun-bun, running win2k under it good enough?
[06:31] <ubuntu_> are you here
[06:31] <ubuntu_> i have bug in gnome irc chat
[06:31] <CarCase928> SilentDis: i am trying to run a 3rd party client for Tencent QQ, the linux versions don't work and are out of date, so my only option is the mac version
[06:31] <cge> ubuntu_: Yes, but I'm trying to respond to many people at once. It isn't in the repositories.
[06:31] <bun-bun> i'm having trouble with it recognizing certain usb devices, i was wondering if you guys have experience with troubleshooting that
[06:31] <CarCase928> SilentDis: where do i find them?
[06:31] <bulmer> hendrickvp: you have to allow that root to login from anywhere, its a bad idea, but since it is your box, who cares right?
[06:31] <cge> bun-bun: What type of devices?
[06:32] <bun-bun> logitech harmony remote controls, specifically
[06:32] <atroWork> hendrickvp, by default root access is limited to local machine, you'll need to enable whatever IP you want to access it from (by first logging in as root on the local machine and typing appropriate commands, which are easy to google for)
[06:32] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  reading the wiki on that app, give me a moment
[06:32] <RoKFiT> will there evere be w32codecs for AMD64?
[06:32] <ismail> im having problems playing my vcd movies
[06:32] <ubuntu_> cge man
[06:32] <hendrickvp> right
[06:32] <bulmer> bun-bun: sometimes you have to wait for that USB to be recognized..or you may need to re-insert it in
[06:32] <cge> ubuntu_: It doesn't appear to exist!?
[06:32] <bun-bun> it just keeps giving me an error
[06:32] <cge> ubuntu_: oops, a typo
[06:32] <ismail> where can i get help that
[06:32] <bun-bun> tried 2 different cables with 2 different remotes
[06:32] <hendrickvp> atroWork: what do I google?
[06:33] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  there's a gaim plugin for it :)
[06:33] <Railer> ANyone have an idea why my XP can get by my new router but my Ubuntu w/ff can't? but they can talk to each other behind the router.
[06:33] <CarCase928> the gaim plugin doesn't work
[06:33] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  http://openq.sourceforge.net/
[06:33] <hendrickvp> atroWork: A friend did send me this : GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword' WITH GRANT OPTION
[06:33] <bulmer> hendrickvp: actually visit #mysql and they proly will assist you
[06:33] <hendrickvp> but I can not get it work work
=== samurai is now known as samiam
[06:33] <CarCase928> SilentDis: i tried that, it doesn't work
[06:33] <atroWork> hendrickvp, give 'mysql remote root access' a try. it's a *very* commonly asked question, even the mysql docs will show you how to do it
[06:33] <ireneshusband> I'm having trouble getting an nfs client running. I do /etc/init.d/nfs-common start and I get...
[06:33] <hendrickvp> tnx
[06:34] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  there's also a native linux client, it appears - http://sourceforge.net/projects/evaq
[06:34] <ireneshusband>  * Starting nfs statd...                                               [fail] 
[06:34] <bun-bun> i'm wondering if there is a config line that can be tweaked into the vmx file
[06:34] <bun-bun> any ideas?
[06:34] <Onizuka> does the latest version of ubuntu install on PPC firewire drives?
[06:34] <nelsonuwp344> i know this is biased but is ubuntu the best linux os?
[06:34] <Onizuka> Cos I've tried, for a couple hours now...
[06:34] <bulmer> bun-bun:  whats that harmony thingy?
[06:34] <Onizuka> and no go..
[06:34] <CarCase928> SilentDis: wanted to try that, but there is no linux install file for it, just a source, and i am new at linux, so i can't use that
[06:34] <Kream> i used to be able to get the plf packages on my ubuntu box with this line - deb http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf edgy-plf free non-free . it worked fine a week or so ago. it doesn't work now. any pointers?
[06:35] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  finally, if all that doesn't work... you should be able to use Wine to use the 'official' Windows client
[06:35] <bun-bun> bulmer# it's a universal remote control
[06:35] <ubuntu_> hey what happend
[06:35] <ubuntu_> cge man
[06:35] <atroWork> hendrickvp, that'd work, but it gives root access to anybody anywhere in the world that figures out 'myuser' and 'mypassword'. A better practice is to limit the IP address (the % after the @ can be replaced with an IP address), or limit which databases it has access to (the first * means all databases, the * after the dot means all objects in that database, so myDatabase.* would give full access to only the database named myDatabase)
[06:35] <CarCase928> SilentDis: it's not cpompatible with wine
[06:35] <ubuntu_> i have bug in XChat-GNOME IRC Chat
[06:35] <bun-bun> nelsonuwp344# "best" is very subjective
[06:35] <CarCase928> compatible
[06:35] <metxas> hi, some people have a cam 174f:a311?
[06:35] <cge> ubuntu_: I'm not sure.
[06:35] <hendrickvp> atrowork, I replace the user and password with my own
[06:36] <ismail> !vcd
[06:36] <nelsonuwp344> bun-bun: how bout a good starting block for a linux experience?
[06:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vcd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:36] <ismail> !repository
[06:36] <CarCase928> SilentDis: the official windows version crashes before it loads when i use it with wine
[06:36] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[06:36] <cge> ubuntu_: But I did look up Zimbra. It isn't in the repositories. Your best option for downloading it is probably to do so from zimbra.com
[06:36] <atroWork> hendrickvp, obviously, but the issue is still the same. Anybody that figures that out can access it from anywhere and get anywhere in the mysql server they want.
[06:36] <SilentDis> CarCase928:  what error does it kick out, if any?
[06:36] <hendrickvp> artoWork, this is true
[06:36] <ireneshusband> nelsonuwp344, I use Dapper on 3 boxes now because it is generally less trouble than others, but it has annoyances. Gentoo can be good if you want to run a lean system in tip-top condition.
[06:37] <cge> ubuntu_: This might be of relevance as well: http://www.zimbra.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1644
[06:37] <bulmer> hendrickvp: for learning purposes its okay, just do not get into that habit of letting root login remotely
[06:37] <atroWork> ubuntu_, I think zimbra is still in beta stages for their ubuntu package. I didn't have a whole lot of luck getting it to work on ubuntu, I ended up using debian instead.
[06:37] <ismail> hey guys where can i find a completelist of repositories
[06:37] <cge> ismail: You don't want to do that!
[06:37] <cge> ismail: What exactly do you mean?
[06:38] <CarCase928> SilentDis: no errors with wine, but the app it self kicks out an error, but the message is in Chinese, and i don't know much Chinese, i know very little, and i am using their English version.
[06:38] <ismail> i want the gnome desktop enviroment multiserve
[06:38] <hendrickvp> artoWork, So if I'm in mysql as root, I should be able to execute correct? will it show anything, besides giving me another line to enter commands that looks like ->
[06:38] <jebho> anyone know how to boot from the live cd with OS X?
[06:38] <bulmer> ismail: what do you mean multiserve?
[06:38] <rajshekhar> hey guys can anyone tell me about wine , bind
[06:38] <cge> ismail: multiverse?
[06:39] <hendrickvp> artoWork: Or am I entering something wrong?
[06:39] <ismail> multiverse
[06:39] <ismail> yup
[06:39] <cge> ismail: You might want to look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu.
[06:39] <ireneshusband> my nfs-common says "fail" on launch. I've checked that the nfs module is loaded. Any idea how I can get the nfs client working?
[06:39] <bulmer> jebho: you have to get the correct version for apple..
[06:40] <ismail> ok thanks cge
[06:40] <cge> ismail: That should give you instructions on how to add official and Canonical repositories.
[06:40] <ismail> one last question
[06:40] <ismail> my vcd isnt working
[06:40] <cge> ismail: What you don't want to do is use a list like Trevio's, which is nearly guaranteed to break your system.
[06:40] <cge> ismail: vcd?
[06:40] <cge> ismail: A video cd?
[06:40] <jebho> bulmer: i have the power pc image burned to a disk, but mac doesnt boot into the cd rom
[06:40] <ismail> yes
[06:40] <jebho> when i restart
[06:41] <ismail> i installed libxine
[06:41] <ismail> ang gstreamer
[06:41] <cge> ismail: I would guess that it still has to do with codecs.
[06:41] <ismail> but it still doesnt work
[06:41] <bun-bun> nelsonuwp344# ubuntu is very user friendly as far as linux distros go, so i would say yes
[06:41] <cge> ismail: Have you read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats?
[06:41] <bulmer> jebho: umm i dont know mac, i would think they would boot off of a cdrom too noh? how else you get the mac loaded with apples os?
[06:42] <`m0> nice... Ubuntu upgrade to edgy failed:D
[06:42] <tx22> is there *any*... I repeast *any* precompiled ubuntu/linux with nvidia with compiz?.. I've tried both sybyoal (forget it's name), and also that other popular distro which was sent a letter cos' they put nviida + ati drivers in so the latest one doesn't have the nvdiia drivers.
[06:42] <`m0> I have to reinstall ubuntu :'(
[06:42] <jebho> bulmer: yeah i dont know, but when i restart it just doesnt boot into the cd, oh well
[06:42] <rajshekhar> cge : hey guys can anyone tell me about wine , bind
[06:42] <nelsonuwp344> bun-bun: ubuntu it is, how do I go about installing it, i just wanna nix xp
[06:42] <carutsu> hey guys has anyone had problems with SuperKaramba?
[06:42] <bioticpro> Hey yall, anybody here have experience with video playback on TV-out of an nvidia card? I am getting occasional choppy playback on all movies out of svideo
[06:42] <cge> rajshekhar: What about wine?
[06:42] <atroWork> hendrickvp, you have to end your mysql commands with a ; otherwise it just sends you to another line and continues input
[06:42] <bulmer> jebho: what other options does mac offer for booting?
[06:43] <jebho> i dont know really, not familiar myself, working on someone elses comp
[06:43] <bun-bun> nelsonuwp344# go to ubuntu.com, download a cd image, burn it, reboot from cdrom
[06:43] <ireneshusband> rajshekhar, wine runs quite a few windows apps, some better than others.
[06:43] <rajshekhar> cge i inslall wine but i dont know how it is used
[06:43] <itsmabus> Can you compile your own kernel in ubuntu?
[06:43] <Meshezabeel> Greetings, I have a Verbatim 4GB USB Hard Drive, Similar to flash usb memory sticks, I would like to install ubuntu to it. Do I use the same procedure as some are doing with flash sticks, or is it different since it is a  hd?
[06:43] <hendrickvp> atroWork: oohh...... that explains alot! :D
[06:43] <ismail> cge: these repositories are for dapper i need to efy
[06:43] <carutsu> is wine support for Windows98 Me better than XP?
[06:44] <cge> ismail: Just replace dapper with edgy.
[06:44] <arrenlex> carutsu: Yes
[06:44] <arrenlex> istenber: Yep.
[06:44] <arrenlex> !kernel | istenber
[06:44] <bulmer> Meshezabeel: does your bios allow to select that device to boot from? check your bios and see if it does
[06:44] <ubotu> istenber: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[06:44] <ireneshusband> rajshekhar, if you have a windows program called thing.exe, you should type wine thing.exe in the terminal
[06:44] <cge> ismail: Except for commercial, if you choose to use that - it should stay as dapper, even when you are running edgy.
[06:44] <carutsu> so i may run old windows apps?
[06:44] <arrenlex> carutsu: You can try
[06:44] <cge> carutsu: The older the better generally, yes.
[06:45] <carutsu> lol thx
[06:45] <kuto_> how do i install sdl in ubuntu?
[06:45] <rajshekhar> cge : i inslall wine but i dont know how it is used
[06:45] <carutsu> ok, thx
[06:45] <fotoflo> hmm, downloading packages is really slow! is there a way i can download them all as torrents, still using synaptic?
[06:45] <daft_man> Hi can some one help me connect to my router?
[06:45] <carutsu> hey what is the latest kernel?
[06:45] <cge> rajshekhar: I think ireneshusband just told you how to use it.
[06:45] <carutsu> !kernel
[06:45] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[06:45] <daft_man> linux detects the network card when I run lspci
[06:45] <cge> fotoflo: Strange, perhaps you are using a faraway server?
[06:45] <CarCase928> can anyone tell me where i can find a mac emulator? i got a lot of software that can not be run on windows or linux, my mac computer quit working about a year ago, and i can't afford to get it fixed, it's a good thing i backed everything up.
[06:45] <bulmer> daft_man:  make the cable long enuff :)
[06:45] <daft_man> but I can't get a connection
[06:45] <hendrickvp> artoWork: so I set it to a non-root user but access is denied, I think I should be good from here. Any other words of wisdom for a newb?
[06:45] <rajshekhar> cge : i dindt understand
[06:45] <Meshezabeel> bulmer, I know some computers allow it and some don't, what I was wondering was is: is the installation method the same as installing to a USB flash memory stick as to a USB hd memory stick?
[06:45] <ireneshusband> rajshekhar, if you have a windows program called thing.exe, you should type wine thing.exe in the terminal
[06:45] <daft_man> lol it connects
[06:46] <daft_man> both side lights up
[06:46] <Marrrrc> can anyone tell me what's the best distribution besides ubuntu?
[06:46] <cge> fotoflo: I generally am able to download them at around 600 to 800 KiB/s.
[06:46] <foosh> Mepis
[06:46] <cge> Marrrrc: Not unless you want to start an argument.
[06:46] <daft_man> is there some sort of tools i can use to set up the network card?
[06:46] <Meshezabeel> tMarrrrc, it would be Edubuntu
[06:46] <Marrrrc> im new in the neighboorhood and i want to change to linux
[06:46] <cge> rajshekhar: You need to open a terminal, and then type wine "/path/to/windows/program.exe".
[06:46] <Marrrrc> but i don't have that much experience
[06:46] <foosh> Download mepis
[06:47] <cge> Marrrrc: Then Ubuntu is probably the best, though I will admit that we are biased.
[06:47] <Marrrrc> thanks!
[06:47] <atroWork> hendrickvp, some mysql clients use an deprecated method of checking the password. If so you'll need to set the password using the old_password function (may or may not have an underscore, and again, since this all comes from the top of my head consider google the holy word, not me ;) )
[06:47] <bulmer> Meshezabeel: i have not use the type of hd you have, but i have installed in on those USB flash and it is same process as if it was a true hard disk, just have to fiddle with the BIOS
[06:47] <carutsu> what's the latest linux kernel?
[06:47] <arrenlex> Marrrrc: Download the ubuntu liveCD and try it out :)
[06:47] <Marrrrc> thanks
[06:47] <fotoflo> cge: hmm can i change my source servers?
[06:47] <rajshekhar> ireneshusband: i dont have thing.exe    where i can get thing.exe
[06:47] <foosh> lol
[06:47] <Marrrrc> anybody knows what's the problem with DRM in Vista?
[06:47] <bulmer> Mes
[06:47] <Meshezabeel> ok, thanks bulmer!
[06:47] <carutsu> what's the latest linux kernel?
[06:47] <cge> Marrrrc: If you want to gain experience quickly, try gentoo, or grml, or even LFS if you really want a challenge.
[06:47] <Marrrrc> i heard something aoubt it
[06:47] <atroWork> Marrrrc, yes... it exists
[06:47] <ireneshusband> rajshekhar, that was a made up file name. it could be photoshop.exe or whatever
[06:47] <Madpilot> Marrrrc, #windows would be a better place for Vista questions
[06:48] <fotoflo> i live in china...  but maybe the chinese servers are slow?
[06:48] <cge> fotoflo: What servers do you have in /etc/apt/sources.list right now?
[06:48] <hendrickvp> atroWork: thanks man you were a lot of help!
[06:48] <chorse> Marrrrc: There are two main problems with DRM in Vista. The first is DRM, the second Vista.
[06:48] <Marrrrc> lol
[06:48] <cge> Marrrrc: Or #ubuntu-offtopic if you want the perspective of Ubuntu users.
[06:48] <Marrrrc> thanks anyway
[06:48] <hendrickvp> atroWork: I would buy you a geometro to say thank you, but I'm going to use that $20 for a present for my bro.
[06:48] <daft_man> hmmm
[06:48] <cge> fotoflo: And what country are you in?
[06:48] <rajshekhar> ireneshusband : thanks ,  also tell me how bind works
[06:48] <CarCase928> !version
[06:48] <ubotu> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[06:48] <cge> fotoflo: Oh, didn't notice that.
[06:48] <atroWork> hendrickvp, no problem. I'll be afk for awhile but feel free to pm if you have more questions and can't get an answer from the channel at large (:
[06:49] <Meshezabeel> bulmer I've heard that installing a swap partition to a usb flash drive prematurley wears out your flash drive. So it's been suggested not to install a swap partition. I'm not sure if this would apply to my HD memory stick though
[06:49] <hendrickvp> l8r
[06:49] <cge> fotoflo: Are there servers in China?
[06:49] <CarCase928> !standards | carutsu
[06:49] <ubotu> carutsu: The current Debian packaging standards version is 3.7.2.2 as of 2006-10-02.
[06:49] <ireneshusband> rajshekar, can't remember. sorry
[06:49] <bulmer> daft_man: usually the tools are  ifconfig, ifup and ip
[06:49] <cge> fotoflo: The default servers are in the UK, if I recall correctly.
[06:49] <carutsu> eh!? standars?
[06:49] <fotoflo> dont know
[06:49] <rajshekhar> cge : can you tell me ho bind works
[06:50] <fotoflo> checked out my sources.list
[06:50] <daft_man> ifconfig only display a loopback
[06:50] <cge> Meshezabeel: If it is actually a hard drive that spins, then it doesn't apply.
[06:50] <fotoflo> alot of it is commented out but there appear to be a bunch of servers on the list
[06:50] <carutsu> i was asking Kernel ver
[06:50] <bulmer> Meshezabeel: you do have other hard disk on your system right and it already has a swap? you can install Ubuntu on the USB, and point the swap to that ole hard disk (reuse it)
[06:50] <cge> rajshekhar: You mean BIND the DNS server? I have no idea. I've never used it.
[06:50] <cge> fotoflo: Could you paste it into #flood?
[06:50] <bulmer> daft_man: it only means you have not activated the Nic card yet
[06:50] <CarCase928> !shut up

[06:52] <john__> is any way to vice chat ?
[06:52] <daft_man> yea I just tried ifup and it said "etho0: ... No such device"
[06:52] <fotoflo> figgered it out
[06:52] <fotoflo> there dosnt seem to be control c and v support from the terminal
[06:52] <cge> john__: No, the din would make it impossible to understand what anyone was saying.
[06:53] <bulmer> daft_man: ifup eth0  not etho0
[06:53] <daft_man> bulmer: how can I activate it. I activated it in bios
[06:53] <minerale> I recently installed an ATI radeon card, did a dpkt -reconfigure, and now all the sudden my X server is using an insane amount of cpu - up to 60% each time I change someting on gnome-terminal, this happen with and without the native ati drivers; simply scrolling one page down on firefox brings xorg usage to 100% (could I blame this on nvidia? )
[06:53] <daft_man> sorry i meant "eth0"
[06:53] <cge> fotoflo: My guess is that the cn servers are slow. You can change cn to other country codes, and see if that speeds up things.
[06:53] <john__> i see ok thanks

[07:03] <fotoflo>  momal: cool, good luck
[07:04] <Jerub> Montaro: okay, tell me how to use sun java instead of gcj.
[07:04] <Jerub> Montaro: ubuntu dapper.
[07:04] <fotoflo> i just installed ubuntu yesterday ...
[07:04] <Siberian_Fox> get 6.10, its more supported
[07:04] <Railer> hey i have weird problem, ff is not getting out after putting on a new router, it worked fine on the old router, but I can still ping locally no problem, and other computers can get out no problem, any suggestions?
[07:04] <Montaro> Jerub: apt-get install sun-java5-jre ?
[07:05] <Jerub> Railer: restart firefox? check for a proxy.
[07:05] <Jerub> Montaro: you'd think so.
[07:05] <momal> that logo is just crap... not even funny... now to go looking at anything video wise with ubuntu again
[07:05] <Railer> ok
[07:05] <Jerub> Montaro: but /usr/bin/java poitns to /etc/alternatives/java which poitns to gcj-java
[07:05] <bulmer> Railer: you allow on your router to forward
[07:05] <Montaro> Jerub: so change the symlink?
[07:05] <curs0r> !pastebin
[07:05] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:06] <Jerub> Montaro: interesting solution, but not useful.
[07:06] <Jerub> Montaro: there are 5 symlinks there. for java, java_vm, javawebstart and 2 man pages.
[07:07] <Jerub> oh hey, 20 symlinks. 14 are sun java, 6 are non-sun java
[07:07] <Railer> I dont think it's a router problem, all my xp's get through fine
[07:08] <Railer> it pings everything inside the router fine, but no irc/ff/mail
[07:09] <bulmer> Railer  type this   iptables -vL  and it will show if you have firewalls enabled
[07:10] <bernhard> Good morning
[07:11] <Railer> there is a fire wall but it was working fine on the old router?
[07:11] <carutsu> how do i compile a new kernel!?
[07:11] <Jerub> carutsu: don't.
[07:11] <carutsu> Jerub wow
[07:12] <Jerub> carutsu: it's not worth your time. the stock ones are awesome.
[07:12] <Jerub> carutsu: if you go and compile your own, the best one you can make is a recreation of the stock one, which is just a net waste of time
[07:12] <dude_> i am new to linux how do i show the folders that are hidden with the ls command eg $home/.what   how do i show the .what using ls
[07:13] <carutsu> Jerub: then i asked wrong, well how do i install one, see my batteries are not recognized by what i have now 2.17 but yes on the 2.19
[07:13] <TGPO> dude_: ls -a
[07:13] <Jerub> carutsu: okay, apt-get build-dep linux; <- that will install the dependancies.
[07:13] <Jerub> carutsu: then I recommend using make-kpkg.
[07:13] <Karark|away> how can i remove Gaim without breaking my install?
[07:13] <Jerub> there are howtos on the net.
[07:14] <carutsu> Jerub so there's no way to just install one i have to compile it?
[07:14] <SiberianFox272> sudo apt-get remove gaim
[07:14] <Karark|away> SiberianFox272, it wants to remove xubuntu-desktop when i do that
[07:14] <dude_> TGPO, thanks  i just couldn't remember havvent slept in 5 days so thx
[07:14] <carutsu> Jerub so there's no way to just install one i have to compile it?
[07:15] <gmbazillion> I was wondering. Windows has a way of making all applications look consistently equal in appearance. Microsoft Windows XP, looks like Microsoft Word, Which looks like Microosft Excel. The menus, the buttons, the whole gui interface looks similar no matter what application you use. Does Linux have something like this that overrides the gui applications?
[07:15] <TGPO> carutsu: correct, but its easier than it sounds, there are several excellent how to's for doing it
[07:15] <carutsu> ok
[07:15] <carutsu> i've heard it'll take like an hour or something
[07:15] <TGPO> carutsu: depending on your processor it can take several hours
[07:16] <evan_> Is there a command to download a file from a url for terminal?
[07:16] <NigelS> evan_: wget
[07:16] <lance_> evad, wget
[07:16] <carutsu> TGPO SEVERA:!?
[07:16] <lance_> blah.
[07:16] <evan_> Thankyou
[07:16] <SiberianFox272> wget
[07:16] <Karark|away> how can i remove Gaim without breaking my install?
[07:16] <Railer> ok I switched from manual IP to DHCP in the interface properties, and everything started to work fine, anyone have a guess why?
[07:17] <dude_> TGPO, i am using edubuntu how do i change the color of the terminal
[07:17] <TGPO> carutsu: yes, depending on your processor, I can do it in 30 minutes
[07:17] <fotoflo> hmm i wish synapitic had torrent built in
[07:17] <gmbazillion> My guess is because the DHCP assigns your computer it's own Internal IP address
[07:17] <NigelS> Railer: you weren't setting the DNS server/gateway properly in the static info?
[07:17] <TGPO> dude_: dont remember the aliases off the top of my head
[07:18] <SiberianFox272> lol no one does
[07:18] <carutsu> TGPO may i ask what processor do you have?
[07:18] <touchscreen> I'm trying to get my Aspen touchscreen to work with Kubuntu, but my limited driver knowledge of Linux is proving to be challenging. It connects VIA USB, and Aspen's site provides drivers for Mandrake, Fedora, and SUSE, but it isn't so kind as to tell us how to install them, or how to modify them for Ubuntu.

[07:18] <Gosha> i run ubuntu edge .. with xubuntu .. and i'm trying to run AOE2 ... i just tried it on ubuntu, with gnome. now problem... but now when i'm trying to start it with xubuntu it keeps prompting about some d3d settings or something .. is it xubuntu not running gnome being the problem? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37877/ <-- that's the output i get when running it from the terminal
[07:18] <touchscreen> Err... ubuntu that is
[07:18] <Railer> but manual should do the same thing? I dont think so, but that might be it but the same as the xp configuration
[07:18] <Gosha> no problem*
[07:19] <gmbazillion> Gosha: D3D = Direct3D.
[07:19] <Gosha> .. mm ?
[07:19] <gmbazillion> Gosha: I am guessing because D3D isn't supported in a unix platform.
[07:19] <Gosha> it worked just fine on ubuntu .. does it mean .. ubuntu can go d3d while xubuntu cant?
[07:19] <dude_> TGPO, k thx anyway
[07:19] <Gosha> ..
[07:19] <gmbazillion> Hmm. I am unsure
[07:19] <Gosha> it Did work on ubuntu~
[07:20] <Gosha> but wont on xubuntu
[07:20] <dude_> does anyone know any good lists for commands eg.  the windows ipconfig command is linux's ifconfig command
[07:21] <z9999> Is there a better program than gnomebaker to burn CD's available for Ubuntu 6.06?
[07:21] <TGPO> z9999: k3b
[07:21] <Railer> set it back to manual and it's fine, maybe I had a typo
[07:21] <carutsu> TGPO by doing this i cant damage my pc? i mean if i do it wrong
[07:21] <Railer> thanks anyway guys
[07:21] <carutsu> TGPO: only the linx partition, right?
[07:21] <SiberianFox272> just reinstall, you can never ruin the PC
[07:22] <hendrickvp> random question, does anyone know how to import a drupal mysql scheme with mysql administrator
[07:22] <carutsu> i knew it, just to make sure
[07:22] <TGPO> carutsu: if you follow through the how to, you will even be able to boot into your old kernel if you hose up compiling the new one
[07:22] <z9999> TGPO: Does the 'k' mean it's a KDE app?
[07:22] <Jerub> z9999: yeah
[07:22] <carutsu> z9999 most likely, lol
[07:22] <TGPO> z9999: yes, but it will install independantly
[07:22] <carutsu> TGPO that's why i only houdl do it if i have to...

[07:23] <z9999> GG
[07:23] <carutsu> TGPO *only
[07:23] <Capslock118> should i be concerned with a virus scanner, if so, what the best?
[07:23] <Gosha> anyway.. how can i make the default screen to go like the others when i log out? .. ( like the ones i get when i press ctrl + alt + f<number> )
[07:23] <carutsu> Capslock118: dont trust me but i've heard you shouldn't
[07:24] <carutsu> Capslock118: you shouldnt worry  i mean

[07:24] <z9999> TGPO: Then there should be no problems running under Ubuntu? And can it burn mp3's?
[07:24] <TGPO> carutsu: its not difficult and you really cant break your system doing it, worse thing that can happen is you have to go back to your original kernel
[07:24] <SiberianFox272> sortta
[07:24] <Robokop> is there a way i can make a new boot option in grub with which i just load enough to listen music (no x and networking and so on)
[07:24] <TGPO> z9999: no problems at all

[07:30] <Gosha> .. is there any knows way to speed up wine? : D
[07:30] <Gosha> are there*

[07:31] <MossimO_Boi> hey guys...do you have any tutorial on how to monitor desktop?
[07:31] <MossimO_Boi> hey guys...do you have any tutorial on how to desktop monitor
[07:31] <Slart> I have a couple of zip-files in a directory and I want to extract them all, to the same directory. I tried "unzip *.zip" but it only unzips the first file and then gives me an error "Caution: filename not matched: file01.zip"
[07:32] <MossimO_Boi> wow...bad english...sorry guys
[07:32] <minerale> touchscreen: here's a free book  on linux device drivers: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxdrive3/book/index.csp
[07:33] <minerale> touchscreen: but um, w/out c skills it's highly ulikely you'll be able to do anything with it
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:33] <dabaR> MossimO_Boi: what is desktop monitoring?
[07:33] <Heinstein99> I wonder if MossimO_Boi means remote desktop?
[07:33] <Heinstein99> VNC?
[07:33] <dabaR> Slart: a couple and you did not extract them one by one yet?
[07:33] <MossimO_Boi> yeah
[07:34] <MossimO_Boi> that's right VNC
[07:34] <captainbeefheart> im having a problem with autmatix...when i open it and its loading...during 'retreiving' keys i get a msg : 'sorry automatix cannot continue because some keys could not be downloaded,please try again later
[07:34] <MossimO_Boi> I tried the VNC but then it came up as my own desktop
[07:34] <captainbeefheart> is that commen?
[07:34] <MossimO_Boi> not the one on my server
[07:34] <Heinstein99> well, did you specify an IP address for it to connect to?
[07:34] <Slart> dabaR: well.. there's about 10 of them.. I could extract them manually.. but the next time it might be 50 of them.. might as well learn to do it =)
[07:34] <disco_stu> Question about ATI drivers - in the Wiki it recommends using the open source driver - but I was wondering if the ATI driver will be better for games - cedega doesnt play the games well - I have a Radeon 9550
[07:34] <MossimO_Boi> no
[07:35] <Heinstein99> you have to enter the IP address of the machine you want to connect to
[07:35] <MossimO_Boi> I think that's why...I'm very new at this Linux stuff...so, if you have any tutorial or anything it would be great
[07:35] <Robokop> is there a way i can make a new boot option in grub with which i just load enough to listen music (no x and networking and so on)
[07:35] <Heinstein99> man why do I keep saying machine
[07:35] <Gosha> tsch, thought s
[07:35] <Gosha> o
[07:35] <karakara> you install the vnc server onto the comp you want to control, then use the client to connect to it from another machine
[07:35] <dabaR> Slart: for i in `ls` do; unzip $i;done
[07:35] <minerale> is it normal for xorg to take up 90% cpu -- how can I diagnose why xorg is so overloaded?
[07:36] <MossimO_Boi> hm..
[07:36] <DBO> minerale, running compiz or beryl?
[07:36] <MossimO_Boi> Thx DaBar
[07:36] <Slart> dabaR: just plain ls? not switches to get a clean list of filenames?
[07:36] <minerale> dbo: nope
[07:36] <minerale> dbo: would that fix it ?
[07:37] <DBO> minerale, no
[07:37] <triplah_> disco_stu, here's a tip. cedega sucks on ati cards. full stop
[07:37] <triplah_> which sucks :/
[07:37] <DBO> minerale, has it always done that?
[07:37] <dabaR> Slart: I think it should be fine.
[07:38] <dabaR> Slart: man ls to find a switch that lists them one on each line
[07:38] <bioticpro> anybody know of a good nvidia help irc?  (Im currently on nvidia freenode, and its dead)
[07:38] <minerale> dbo: only after I installed an ati radeon card
[07:38] <Heinstein99> any idea if XGL will run on my Radeon 9600?
[07:38] <disco_stu> It didn't seem too bad - just the texturing was off - I was wondering if FGLRX will fix this
[07:38] <minerale> dbo: seems to 100 percen whether or not I use the binary driver
[07:38] <MossimO_Boi> well, I just learn how to crack wep key 64 bit.  took me about 3 hrs on how to do it, but I don't mind.
[07:38] <Robokop> is there a way i can make a new boot option in grub with which i just load enough to listen music (no x and networking and so on)
[07:38] <Slart> dabaR: bash: syntax error near unexpected token `unzip'
[07:38] <MossimO_Boi> my next step is to use the VNC
[07:38] <MossimO_Boi> thanks guys
[07:39] <dabaR> for i in `ls`; do unzip $i;done
[07:39] <DBO> minerale, are there any fun messages in dmesg?
[07:39] <MossimO_Boi> when I'm done with the vnc, I'll come back and ask for more.  Hope you guys don't mind
[07:39] <minerale> dbo: how can I tell?
[07:39] <dabaR> Slart: it takes a few tries to get it all on one line.
[07:39] <DBO> minerale, give me the output of dmesg | tail -20 in pastebin please

[07:40] <haxality> hey, I just experienced a truly bizarre problem
[07:40] <ednagler> hey is anybody available for help?
[07:40] <haxality> I was over at my friends house, and I tried to connect to his wireless lan
[07:40] <minerale> dbo: err um, it seems to be an endless stream of wlan messages
[07:40] <haxality> my wireless card got an IP address fine with DHCP, but I couldn't ping the router or any of the network computers
[07:41] <haxality> and I couldn't access the internet
[07:41] <ednagler> hey is anybody available for help?
[07:41] <DBO> minerale, mmmmm not handy, lemme see your /var/log/Xorg.0.log in pastebin
[07:41] <haxality> I tried everything I know, releasing the DHCP lease and renewing it, disabling/re-enabling the card, etc
[07:41] <haxality> I guess it's not a real REAL problem, but I'm curious
[07:42] <DarthLappy> !ask | ednagler
[07:42] <ubotu> ednagler: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:42] <ednagler> o ok sorry
[07:43] <Gosha> i have a 2.13 GHz proccessor and a 512 mr ram .. wouldn't i theoretcially be able to run AOE2 smoothly on my ubuntu?
[07:43] <ednagler> I want to add a new menu to my applications panel, so go to the menu editor and when I add a menu to the editor i can't enable (check) it off, it just won't check
[07:43] <Robokop> is there a way i can make a new boot option in grub with which i just load enough to listen music (no x and networking and so on)
[07:43] <minerale> dbo: um hold on, pastebin is having database trouble
[07:43] <bioticpro> dabaR, thx, I already have the nvidia driver installed, but I am having problems with the svideo performance
[07:43] <DBO> minerale, use pastebin.ca
[07:44] <minerale> dbo: http://pastebin.ca/284734
[07:45] <Gosha> ah, and a nvidia gefoce mx 440 graphic card .. is it impossible for me?
[07:46] <DBO> minerale, ok you need to add a quick section to your xorg.conf
[07:46] <ednagler> !ask I want to add a new menu to my applications panel, so go to the menu editor and when I add a menu to the editor i can't enable (check) it off, it just won't check
[07:46] <DBO> Section "Extensions"
[07:46] <DBO>      Option "Composite" "Disable"
[07:46] <DBO> EndSection   <--- just like that minerale
[07:49] <Slart> dabaR: got it to work . "for i in $(ls); do unzip $i;done" .. still wish there was a easier way
[07:52] <DBO> Slart, unzip wont accept multiple filenames?
[07:52] <DBO> Slart, ls | xargs unzip
[07:52] <ChrisBradley> :)
[07:53] <Slart> DBO: nope.. it just tries to extract filename 2 from filename 1
[07:53] <Slart> DBO: and of course, fails miserably doing that =)
[07:53] <DBO> Slart, ls | xargs unzip should work fine
[07:54] <ski-worklap> for zip in `ls *.zip` ; do unzip "$i" ; done
[07:54] <ski-worklap> err
[07:54] <DBO> xargs is the way to do a for loop with a pipe =P
[07:54] <ski-worklap> for zip in `ls *.zip` ; do unzip "$zip" ; done
[07:54] <ski-worklap> DBO, not always, as you now see.
[07:56] <Slart> DBO: hmm.. the xargs thingy didn't work.. it just tries to unzip the first file.. not the others
[07:56] <touchscreen> If I have a bunch of tar.gz files for a touchscreen for other distros of linux.. is there anyway I can compile them to work on Ubuntu?
[07:56] <DBO> Slart, it might need ls | xargs -i unzip {}
[07:56] <Jordan_U> XGL won't start, I am following these directions: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/XGL#Changing_your_standard_login
[07:56] <DBO> Slart, yeah just checked, ls | xargs -i unzip {} will work
[07:56] <Slart> DBO: ah.. that worked.
[07:56] <touchscreen> The ones I have are for Redhat, FC, SUSE, and Mandrake
[07:56] <Jordan_U> touchscreen: Most source packages will work with any distribution
[07:57] <Slart> DBO: thanks
[07:57] <DBO> Slart, there you are, a much easier way to do it =P
[07:57] <touchscreen> Even if they're compiled for a specific kernel? Say the 2.4.22-1.2115.nptl?
[07:57] <DBO> xargs once again proves that for $i loops are useless =P

[07:59] <DBO> ednagler, did you move an application into it first?
[07:59] <touchscreen> Okay.. I'm going to try to follow the readme in this archive. Which distro should I use the drivers for? FC, Red Hat, SUSE, or Mandrake?
[07:59] <ednagler> I can't even create a item
[07:59] <DBO> touchscreen, the drivers will need to be compiled for your particular kernel
[08:00] <Jordan_U> touchscreen: What do you mean by compiled for a specific kernel?
[08:00] <Jordan_U>  If you are compiling it yourself why would you compile it for a kernel that you don't have? Do you mean written for a different kernel?
[08:00] <touchscreen> I think they were written for a different kernel because the readme has this set of instructions with it

[08:01] <touchscreen>       #tar xvf usbtouchchardrv.tar
[08:01] <touchscreen>    c. copy touch.o to /lib/modules/2.4.22-1.2115.nptl/kernel/drivers/usb

[08:01] <touchscreen> That 2.4.22 indicates a different set of kernel headers if I'm correct?

[08:04] <touchscreen> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37882/ That's the URL to the readme that I have
[08:05] <touchscreen> But I know its written for Fedora and Red Hat
[08:07] <DBO> touchscreen, pasting in here = bad
[08:10] <touchscreen> Any idea if that readme is even valid for this distro?
[08:12] <Madpilot> touchscreen, I doubt it, it seems to reference xfree86, which Ubuntu doesn't use
[08:12] <touchscreen> So, most likely, no touchscreen for me?
[08:12] <Madpilot> well, not with that tutorial - it's out of date
[08:13] <DBO> touchscreen, mind telling me exactly which hardware you got?
[08:13] <DBO> Ill poke around and see if I can find you an up to date driver
[08:13] <touchscreen> Lemme get the exact name DBO, thanks :)

=== Geoffrey3 is now known as Geoffrey2
[08:15] <albie> I can run it manually but I'd like it to autostart, is there a file I can edit that controls the startup programs in gnome?
[08:15] <LinTux> I have just noticed that my wastebin always has 607 files in it and they wont empty out, any ideas?
[08:16] <DBO> touchscreen, USB or serial?
[08:17] <touchscreen> USB
[08:17] <Geoffrey2> can someone explain to me what a .tar file is as compared to a .gz file?
[08:17] <deep> !udev
[08:17] <ubotu> udev: rule-based device node and kernel event manager. In component main, is important. Version 093-0ubuntu18 (edgy), package size 224 kB, installed size 768 kB
[08:17] <deep> ah

[08:19] <DBO> mmmm might have a winnder for you hear touchscreen
[08:20] <DBO> winner*
[08:20] <DBO> gotta see still
[08:20] <DBO> still downloading
[08:21] <Rug> Geoffrey2: Tar is a container file (originally used for making backups to tape) .gz is a compressed file.   Add the two and you have the most secure way to save your data
[08:21] <treat> hello, how do i install a new language? i installed the language-pack-sv but i can not select my new langugage in gdm =/
[08:22] <treat> i'm using edgy
[08:22] <Geoffrey2> Rug, so tar combines all the files into one file, and then gzip compresses the tar file.....
[08:22] <Rug> Geoffrey2: yeah basically
[08:23] <DBO> mmm nope too old *goes back to looking*
[08:25] <Geoffrey2> is ogg vorbis considered the best audio codec out there quality wise?
[08:25] <treat> i get this error to: 'sv' is not a supported language or locale
[08:25] <Madpilot> Geoffrey2, it's a lossy format, like mp3. For quality, use .flac, which is lossless
[08:26] <Rug> Geoffrey2: it's the best "Compressed" format.   .wav or FLAAC (sp?) are best for non-compressed
[08:26] <h00t>  can anyone tell me what does it mean when i identify to the nickserv it set's my mode to "+e" ... what is "+e mode"
[08:26] <Rug> h00t: +evil
[08:26] <Rug> h00t: that means we don't trust you
[08:26] <Jordan_U> Thanks! XGL and beryl are both working perfectly now :)
[08:26] <h00t> that is true my friend

[08:27] <touchscreen> Hmm... well.. how much?
[08:27] <DBO> touchscreen, no clue... waiting for the email
[08:28] <touchscreen> And h00t, +e means event back in the day.. so if it hasn't changed
[08:30] <DBO> touchscreen, nope even these idiots are still working with xfree86
[08:30] <DBO> you might be SOL my friend

[08:39] <hoth> thx
[08:39] <santyago> hi all
[08:39] <Lynoure> FreeNet: Give some more details on it, and people will see
[08:39] <FreeNet> details?
[08:39] <FreeNet> like?
[08:40] <Lynoure> FreeNet: Did you delete files, mess up permissions, or what?
[08:40] <FreeNet> oh... i have set my whole /var to root chown and cpy chgrp
[08:40] <santyago> =\ fuck, this not russian chats
[08:41] <FreeNet> now all my apache need the whole of /var/lib need 777 inorder to let my apache run properly
[08:41] <BrendanJ> hi, sorry, I'm not sure how this is supposed to work. I'm having some trouble with my touchpad/trackpoint, and I think it's an xorg.conf issue. Who should I be talking to?
[08:41] <FreeNet> which is very wrong
[08:41] <FreeNet> will you let me know what's the group and owner of /var/lib?
[08:41] <kerpal> Anyone know how to get SATA drives to work with Ubuntu?
[08:41] <tinchio> Hi people I have a question how do I know my IP using the console? I know that using ifconfig but I just want It to tell me ONLY th IP adress,
[08:41] <Lynoure> FreeNet: 4 drwxr-xr-x 44 root root  4096 2006-12-09 19:00 lib
[08:42] <FreeNet> you have apache running php stuff?
[08:42] <Lynoure> FreeNet: No, not on this computer
[08:43] <FreeNet> oh...
[08:43] <Madpilot> kerpal, they should just work; my only HDD is SATA and I've never had any issues
[08:43] <Geoffrey2> hmm, looks like bz2 compresses a lot better than gz...any particular reason or situation where I'd want to use gz instead?
[08:43] <kerpal> it's weird, it lists the total capacity and the name, but not the partitions
[08:43] <Lynoure> FreeNet: try setting the files apache cannot read to have same group apache has.
[08:44] <kerpal> lemme see what it says in the installer
[08:44] <Winter> well that didn't work...
[08:44] <wedderburn> ok simple question is it possible to run 64bit binaries in a 32 bit os?
[08:45] <Winter> probably not
[08:45] <FreeNet> Lynoure: so what do you mean?
[08:45] <whyameye> wedderburn: I can't imagine that it would be...
[08:45] <kerpal> it say's "Couldn't mount device 'dev/sda1': input/output error
[08:45] <wedderburn> whyameye: sweet thanks
[08:45] <FreeNet> so /www and /lib has to be in apache group?
[08:46] <whyameye> wedderburn: my word isn't gospel here. Just thinking about it I just can't imagine that it would work.
[08:46] <Lynoure> FreeNet: certainly /lib as whole should not be
[08:47] <FreeNet> i think maybe it's php
[08:47] <y_kuznetsov> net rpc join -U user%pass say  error setting trust account password: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED/ What is wrong?
[08:48] <kerpal> Madpilot, any idea how to remedy an "input/output' error in the partitioner?
[08:48] <Madpilot> kerpal, no idea, sorry. Post the exact error here, though, someone else might be able to help

[09:19] <touchscreen> Okay, i've modprobed everything in the touchscreen modules directory, restarted X, and still no touchscreen ability. My xorg.conf lists my monitor, but I don't think it's got the part that it's supposed to be a touchscreen. Any suggestions?

[09:20] <the_rick> oooh, I came in at a good time

[09:20] <FreeNet> please... teach me how... thanks

[09:21] <FreeNet> all entries are mirrrored!
[09:21] <DBO> bingo...
[09:22] <DBO> and you dont make nightly backups of the system?
[09:22] <hoth67> FreeNet: with great power comes great holes in the foot. before shooting yourself in the foot again, I'd suggest you get "Linux in a Nutshell" (O'Reilly publisher) - see amazon.com or equivalent
[09:22] <FreeNet> no... i don't
[09:22] <touchscreen> Linux for dummies is also a good one.
[09:23] <DBO> FreeNet, there is no way around this then, you are going to have to reinstall the OS
[09:23] <FreeNet> hoth67>	and touchscreen>	pls... help first, lecture later.
[09:23] <FreeNet> oh shit!
[09:23] <DBO> I can help you get back up and running as quickly as possible
[09:23] <FreeNet> i'm dead

[09:24] <Lynoure> DBO: I'm happy with once in 24h in many cases, but yes :)
[09:24] <hoth67> FreeNet: and please avoid running as 'root' whenever possible (sorry for lecture). Ok, I'll read some man pages for suggestions now...
[09:25] <Lynoure> FreeNet: what inspired you to change the permissions that way to start with? (not a retorical question, I'm really curious)
[09:26] <FreeNet> coz Joomla is complaining that it cannot write to this directory and that as well... it just keep complaining... until i find it too troublesome and make everthing writable
[09:27] <tom_> hey guys, i've installed a newer version of libtheora, and i want to use it instead of the one in the repos. how can i trick apt into getting rid of the libtheora but not all the apps that go with it?
[09:28] <Lynoure> FreeNet: yes, but the changes before that you made it all owned by root and group company.
[09:28] <FreeNet> no.... like written there... I was trying to reset all the permission etc...
[09:28] <Lynoure> FreeNet: I'm wondering if the motivation was something that could be warned against when advicing new people.
[09:29] <hoth67> FreeNet: from your post on ubuntuforuns, I don't understand why you can't reset your permissions. If you're 'root' you can do EVERYTHING
[09:29] <FreeNet> yes i am root...
[09:29] <FreeNet> how shd i restore?
[09:29] <Lynoure> hoth67: there are gazillion of files to deal with. If you tell him the permissions for all and each, yes he can
[09:30] <Lynoure> hoth67: otherwise it's a long processes of knowing, guessing and adjusting
[09:31] <hoth67> FreeNet: have you tried 'man chown', 'man chgrp', man chmod?  --> the -R option means 'recursive'
[09:31] <FreeNet> man chown? what's that?
[09:32] <Rookie_> man = manual
[09:32] <idlemind> speaking of backups i'm looking into switching to ubuntu server for 2 of my servers (from suse enterprise linux); anyone that can point me to an article/forum discussion about the best way to backup ubuntu server?
[09:33] <hoth67> FreeNet: open a terminal, then type those commands (with Return after each). Will give you what each command does, the syntax, etc.
[09:34] <Lynoure> FreeNet: can I ask some general questions? So it was some other person with root or sudo that changed them all to be owned by root? Do you have many people that can do that? Is anyone of them actually responsible for the system?
[09:35] <cyber> hello :P
[09:35] <thoreauputic> FreeNet: not to be rude - but why on earth did you chown /var on your company's server with two weeks experience ? :-(
[09:35] <Lynoure> FreeNet: It makes sense to have someone responsible, and minimise the number of people with root, to prevent accidents like this.

[09:38] <xu_zhu> im having alot of trouble trying to install mp3 codecs.  i tried EasyUbuntu, which had all sorts of problems, including giving 404 errors for most of the files it tried to download.  Automatix gave a 404 error for the codecs. When i try to enable Universal and Multiverse Ripositories i get a network error.  My internet works fine otherwise.  Any ideas what i can do? Ive been through the forums and the wiki pretty thourougly i think.
[09:38] <zeeble> firebird is the databae,right?
[09:38] <Cyber_Stalker> math,  is your universe enabled?

[09:39] <Cyber_Stalker> check that universe is enabled, then try again
[09:39] <joaquin_> zeeble, there iare'nt packages for ubuntu and debian
[09:40] <fotoflo> hey
[09:40] <fotoflo> ive just installed libNTFS8
[09:40] <zeeble> joaquin_: i can see a few.... but i'm using feisty
[09:40] <fotoflo> how do i get to my NTFS filesystem?
[09:40] <Cyber_Stalker> thoreauputic, i would like to lauch 2 programs easily, instead of cd'ing to that dir, and typeing ./unreal start & ./services
[09:40] <joaquin_> zeeble, ok y am using dapper i think i need to change
[09:40] <zeeble> joaquin_: then just download it from the www, and use its shell scrpt to access the database
[09:40] <zeeble> joaquin_: no. no need to change.. if you want to change, change to edgy. not feisty.
[09:41] <joaquin_> zeeble, ok but i had problems with shared libs

[09:41] <ubotu> fotoflo: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse

[09:41] <zeeble> joaquin_: hm, ok. not sure.
[09:41] <fotoflo> !fuse
[09:41] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[09:41] <touchscreen> I think I'm just going to copy and paste this code onto the end of xorg and pray
[09:41] <Cyber_Stalker> any ideas thoreauputic ? :P
[09:42] <xu_zhu> Cyber_Stalker: yeah, ive read those, but to install that stuff i need to enable universal and multiverse repositories, and when i follow the wiki directions for that, "Packages.gz" for Universe says it isnt found on the ubuntu site.
[09:42] <Cyber_Stalker> im new to linux, but im assuming i could write a simple script to do it?
[09:42] <stonarmusic> hey now!
[09:42] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: exactly
[09:42] <Cyber_Stalker> thoreauputic, could u nudge me in the right direction for doing it? i know nothing about it :P
[09:42] <Cyber_Stalker> xu_zhu, im not sure then :( sorry m8 i tried tho :P
[09:43] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: just a one liner or an alias - if you want clickable, put it in /usr/local/bin and make a launcher
[09:43] <stonarmusic> Good mornin' everah body!
[09:43] <Cyber_Stalker> thoreauputic, bash script?
[09:43] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: basically a simple script is just a list of commands - in this case you could probably put it all in one line under a #!/bin/bash
[09:44] <thoreauputic> then make the file executable
[09:44] <thoreauputic> and maybe move it to /usr/local/bin
[09:44] <Cyber_Stalker> lol ok, i have no idea whats going on :P
[09:44] <Cyber_Stalker> !bash
[09:44] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[09:44] <Cyber_Stalker> hmm
[09:44] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: you might want to read a simple bash tutorial...
[09:45] <Cyber_Stalker> yea that might do it :P
[09:45] <touchscreen> How can I find out what USB port my monitor is connected to so i can write that into xorg?
[09:45] <Cyber_Stalker> my knowledge of linux and ubuntu doesnt progress past booting it in VMware :P
[09:45] <Rookie_> touchscreen - should stand in dmseg
[09:45] <Rookie_> dmesg
[09:46] <touchscreen> How do I see dmesg?
[09:46] <apokryphos> Cyber_Stalker: there's a nice vmware image at http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2580 btw
[09:46] <Rookie_> just type it, type dmesg|less
[09:46] <fotoflo> 1. Open System  Administration  Disks.
[09:46] <Cyber_Stalker> lol apokryphos ive got it running tho :P so its fine
[09:46] <Cyber_Stalker> every thing works
[09:46] <fotoflo> dosnt exist
[09:46] <Cyber_Stalker> got my ftp server up
[09:46] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html  <-- it says "advanced" but don't let that scare you: just dip in as far as you need to and come back to it
[09:47] <Cyber_Stalker> just want an easy way to start up unreal-ircd & anope services
[09:47] <lavid> Does anyone know how to get the sonypi module working in 64 bit feisty. Note that the module is lacking from anything with kernel >= 2.6.17 as per https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/75298
[09:47] <Cyber_Stalker> thanks alot thoreauputic
[09:47] <thoreauputic> np :)
[09:47] <Cyber_Stalker> was that the top link frmo google?
[09:47] <touchscreen> Well... I see quite a long list.. Only one reference to usb1-1 which I think is my rat?
[09:47] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: i think so yes :)
[09:47] <Cyber_Stalker> cuase i saw advanced and skipped it:P i went on the the 3rd link, basic bash :P
[09:48] <touchscreen> okay, plugged it into a different port and see one on usb 2-2
[09:48] <touchscreen> Is that the port name?
[09:48] <touchscreen> I'm trying to fit it to this line format         Option     "Device"     "/dev/ttyS0"
[09:48] <touchscreen> where ttyS0 is my USB drive
[09:48] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: basically, make a file ( touch scriptname) ; make the first line #!/bin/bash ; put the command on the line below  <-- gross oversimplification but for simple things, should work
[09:49] <hendrickvp> anyone know how or where to get and install the "image toolkit"?
[09:49] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: then make sure it is in the PATH for your  user, or link ro it from a launcher or whatever
[09:49] <thoreauputic> *to
[09:51] <hendrickvp> anyone know anything about the "image toolkit"? I can't find anything useful online to my sitch
[09:53] <the_rick> I'm using my Ubuntu as a NAT.  Anyone know how to make dhcpd use nameservers that internet nic gets from dhcp?
[09:53] <hoth67> what's "image toolkit"?
[09:53] <the_rick> I've looked all over for dynamic dns, but all I get back is stuff about DYNdns
[09:54] <Cyber_Stalker> thanks thoreauputic
[09:54] <Cyber_Stalker> will do some learning now
[09:54] <hendrickvp> something that runs on the server, and must be installed so that sites that have image resizing and so will work
[09:54] <levander> Somebody can tell me what ubuntu-edgy-updates.git is?
[09:54] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: no problem :) Bash is quite powerful and interesting once you get into it a bit
[09:55] <Cyber_Stalker> th
[09:55] <Cyber_Stalker> thoreauputic,

[09:55] <Cyber_Stalker> echo "listing files in the current directory, $PWD"

[09:55] <hendrickvp> I can't find anything online as far as how to install this on Ubuntu Server
[09:55] <Cyber_Stalker> thats the one im using :P ure tut i havnt read through yet :P
[09:55] <hendrickvp> running PHP5
[09:55] <Cyber_Stalker> but its what u were saying so yea :P
[09:56] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: that's a start :) You can run in debug mode to see what's wrong with a script too
[09:56] <hoth67> hendrickvp: so it's an apache module?
[09:56] <Cyber_Stalker> coolio :P
[09:57] <hendrickvp> yes
[09:57] <Cyber_Stalker> ill get here soon, got a chick speaking to me on my windows box so i cant dive into this yet
[09:57] <Cyber_Stalker> but thoreauputic this i create a script right, like unreallauncher, that does what i want it to, but then i need to create a launcher to it, other wise i still have to cd to that dir and run it?
[09:57] <the_rick> !encryptfs
[09:57] <sidny4> anyone know how to get surround sound to work?
[09:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about encryptfs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:58] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: well, if you put it in the PATH you don't need to cd
[09:58] <Cyber_Stalker> lol :P
[09:58] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: /usr/local/bin is a good spot for system wide scripts
[09:59] <thoreauputic> or a link from there ( also works)
[09:59] <lavid> kaixo xfugazix
[09:59] <Cyber_Stalker> thoreauputic, i guss ill just have to create a launcher for it, but if i can can create a launcher for a script, cant i create a launcher for the program im trying to run anyway?
[09:59] <thoreauputic> but you can just put the whole path to the script in a launcher
[09:59] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: yes, of course
[09:59] <Cyber_Stalker> lol, then why am i taking the long way round :P
[10:00] <xfugazix> lavid, Kaixo? xD
[10:00] <sidny4> anyone know how to get surround sound to work?
[10:00] <frogzoo> Cyber_Stalker: launch it from nautilus?
[10:00] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: but if it's a service it probably has a start script in /stc/init.d anyway..
[10:00] <hoth67> hendrickvp: to avoid confusion, you should then refer to it as 'apache'. To my knowledge there is no such thing as an 'ubuntu server'. That's a distribution
[10:00] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: you're learning is why :)
[10:00] <xfugazix> kaixo lavid , egun on
[10:00] <z9999> Can someone tell me how to make vlc player open automatically when a CD containing .mp3 or .wav files is inserted?
[10:00] <hendrickvp> hoth67: this is true sorry
[10:00] <Cyber_Stalker> frogzoo, i want it automated to an extent
=== xfugazix is now known as \dev\null\
[10:01] <Cyber_Stalker> it dont want to still have to go trudgin through nautilus finding the exacutable
[10:01] <hendrickvp> hoth67: http://drupal.org/node/32741 <---this is what I found but the apt-get install php4-imagick is not there
=== \dev\null\ is now known as fulldisclosure
[10:01] <PORDO> sound's not working for me now that i've upgraded to edgy... :(
[10:01] <Cyber_Stalker> thoreauputic, if it had a start script it would run at startup right?
[10:01] <thoreauputic> z9999: System-Preferences-Removable Drives and Media
[10:01] <hoth67> hendrickvp: have you tried a search on the Synaptic Package Manager?  That's the easiest route I'd try first
[10:01] <frogzoo> z9999: sys -> prefs -> removable devices
[10:02] <thoreauputic> z9999: change the entry for audio CDs there
[10:02] <hendrickvp> hoth67: no, I will try that tnx
[10:02] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: normally yes - some need configuration
[10:02] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: the particular one you are using, i don't know about
[10:03] <curs0r> http://youtube.com/watch?v=rT-5kqfG0tI
[10:03] <Cyber_Stalker> its unrealIRCD
[10:03] <Cyber_Stalker> and irc daemon,
[10:03] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: installed with apt/synaptic?
[10:03] <Cyber_Stalker> it doesnt start at boot, but i dont want it to, i just want to make it easyer to boot
[10:03] <Cyber_Stalker> and no to snynaptic, synaptic listed some other IRCD's that i didnt like
[10:03] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: if so, type  dpkg -L <packagename> | less to see what files it installed
[10:03] <hoth67> hendrickvp: just in case, you get that from the main menu System -> Administration -> Synaptic...  At least that's how it looks on my box
[10:04] <Cyber_Stalker> so i had to compile, i coundnt find unreal in the repositorys
[10:04] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: hmmm - you used checkinstall of course ? *grin*
[10:04] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: bet you didn't...
[10:04] <Cyber_Stalker> lol
[10:04] <Cyber_Stalker> whats check install?:P
[10:04] <thoreauputic> !checkinstall
[10:04] <ubotu> checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall - Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page, and DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[10:04] <PORDO> checkinstall automatically makes packages from source.
[10:05] <slipttees> ayo...create .torrent file on ubuntu?
[10:05] <slipttees> ayo...create .torrent file on ubuntu?
[10:05] <Cyber_Stalker> lol
[10:05] <Cyber_Stalker> no i never did that :P
[10:05] <thoreauputic> slicslak: don't repeat please
[10:05] <Cyber_Stalker> so what would i do, run ./config then make, then checkinstall?
[10:05] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: well the files are probably in /usr/local - have a look
[10:06] <Cyber_Stalker> yea i know where all the files are :P
[10:06] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: yes, with sudo for the checkinstall step
[10:06] <lavid> Does anyone know how to get the sonypi module working in 64 bit feisty? Note that the module is lacking from anything with kernel >= 2.6.17 as per https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/75298
[10:06] <slipttees> please...with the create .torrent in ubuntu?
[10:06] <Cyber_Stalker> i just dont like having to browse to that dir (through console or nauti) to launch it
[10:06] <thoreauputic> makes it easier to keep your compiled stuff in the packaging system
[10:06] <PORDO> " undefined symbol: __gst_debug_min"
[10:07] <lavid> maybe a better question is how to install modules that are in the vanilla kernel, but not in the ubuntu 64bit kernel
[10:07] <NineTeen67Comet> Little question .. Any one have a good tutorial for implimenting an e-mail server on an ubuntu server? (Already running www, php, mysql, samba, nfs, and ftp) .. I would like it to get my mail from gmail and hand it out to local machines, as well as send it out.
[10:07] <z9999> thoreauputic: OK, and thank you.
[10:08] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: the executable might not be in /usr/local/bin - you can link to it with  sudo ln -s /usr/local/foo/whatever-your-executable-is /usr/local/bin/name-of-choice

[10:10] <julian__> hey guys, i just connected to my friend wireless but for some reason i get a really slow internet connection compared to her windows box
[10:10] <thoreauputic> slicslak: i think azureus can make .torrent files for you ( again, never done it)
[10:10] <julian__> any suggestions
[10:10] <slipttees> thoreauputic: for me?
[10:10] <Cyber_Stalker> julian__, hack her machine, boot it off the network & all other;s leaching the speed & u dominate :P

[10:10] <Cyber_Stalker> just kidding sorry i have no idea :?

[10:11] <slipttees> ;)
[10:11] <Cyber_Stalker> hmm
[10:11] <Cyber_Stalker> ok lets try making the launcher
[10:12] <frogzoo> julian__: install mii-tools & check your autonegotiate
[10:12] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: in general, prefer packages from the repositories and only compile when you understand how it works - but on the other hand, you learn by trying so ignore me :))
[10:12] <slipttees> thoreauputic: yeppp, thanks ;)
[10:12] <frogzoo> julian__: oh wireless, nvm
[10:12] <Cyber_Stalker> lol yea
[10:12] <Cyber_Stalker> i know its in the repo's but whats the fun of that :P
[10:12] <frogzoo> julian__: check you're using 802.11g
[10:13] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker:  sudo aptitude install apt-howto && apt-howto
[10:13] <thoreauputic> ;-p
[10:13] <Cyber_Stalker> its more fun compiling from source and having a messed up file system with lots of lost things here and there
[10:13] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: whatever floats your boat I guess ;-)
[10:13] <Cyber_Stalker> see the problem with the launcher, is it allows 1 command i think
[10:14] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker:  man bash .... /me runs away laughing
[10:14] <PORDO> arghhh...sounnnd
[10:14] <Cyber_Stalker> like for example i need to run /home/cyber/services/ ./services
[10:14] <PORDO> edgy i hate you.
[10:14] <Cyber_Stalker> lol thoreauputic  :P
[10:14] <openix> Hi - any of you know a good app which shows your network download speed and usage?
[10:14] <thoreauputic> Cyber_Stalker: I was serious about the apt-howto by the way
[10:14] <Cyber_Stalker> lol
[10:14] <Cyber_Stalker> im so confused
[10:15] <frogzoo> openix: iftop?
[10:15] <thoreauputic> !apt-howto | Cyber_Stalker
[10:15] <Cyber_Stalker> 1 thing at a time, let me get this launcer working, then ill read how tos

[10:15] <frogzoo> openix: cli
[10:15] <thoreauputic> hmm the pipe doesn't work with spaces?

[10:19] <cableroy_> howcome kismet does not come up in add/remove in gnome when searching, but useing apt in terminal it does?
[10:19] <thoreauputic> cableroy_: add-remove doesn't have all the packages - you might want to use synaptic instead
[10:21] <Madpilot> cableroy_, probably because kismet doesn't have a menu entry by default?

[10:24] <Cyber_AfK> thoreauputic, cd ~/Games/nwn/
[10:24] <Cyber_AfK> thats home games nwn right?
[10:24] <thoreauputic> yes
[10:25] <Cyber_AfK> ok
[10:25] <LinTux> when installing programs in Ubuntu, am is it advisable to install programs marked KDE in Gnome?
[10:25] <thoreauputic> well, it's /home/Games/nwn/ not /home/games/nwn to be pedantic ( ie *nix is case sensitive)
[10:26] <thoreauputic> uh -- I mean it's /home/youruser/Games/nwn
[10:26] <thoreauputic>   ~ means $HOME which is your home dir
[10:27] <Cyber_AfK> lol
[10:27] <Cyber_AfK> ye ai got that
[10:27] <thoreauputic> LinTux: you can run KDE apps in Gnome, sure
[10:27] <LinTux> Thanks thoreauputic
[10:27] <thoreauputic> LinTux: and vice versa of course...
[10:28] <Cyber_AfK> thoreauputic, why am i told to do this "chmod +x unrealstart.sh"
[10:28] <julian__> installing tools
[10:28] <LinTux> cheers buddy, best thing I did was dump that XP and move to Ubuntu
[10:28] <thoreauputic> Cyber_AfK: to make it executable
[10:28] <LordSkylark> i wonder how to spell "vice versa" in english
[10:28] <LordSkylark> ^^
[10:28] <Cyber_AfK> ok
[10:28] <thoreauputic> LordSkylark: I think I had it right
[10:28] <julian__> what are mii tools called
[10:29] <thoreauputic> it's Latin anyway
[10:29] <LordSkylark> thoreauputic i'm italian and that word is exactly the same here
[10:29] <LordSkylark> but sure with a different pronunciation
[10:29] <LordSkylark> :P
[10:29] <thoreauputic> ah, well the Latin has survived apparently
[10:29] <Cyber_AfK> lol ok thoreauputic  now i have a file called unrealstart.sh in my home dir, but what should be put in the launcher?
[10:29] <thoreauputic> Cyber_AfK:  /path/to/unreal.sh ( whatver that might be in your case)
[10:29] <LordSkylark> well, i think in GB they use other terms for that word
[10:30] <Cyber_AfK> ok
[10:30] <Cyber_AfK> thanks
[10:30] <Cyber_AfK> can i use ~
[10:30] <Cyber_AfK> cause then its ~/unrealstart.sh
[10:30] <LordSkylark> btw thoreauputic, do you know how to restore the original grub on MBR? grub-install only restored the command line one
[10:30] <thoreauputic> Cyber_AfK: yes it should expand out Ok I think - why not try it and see ? <hint>
[10:30] <Cyber_AfK> lol :P
[10:31] <Cyber_AfK> let me just tick "run in terminal" so i can see what it does :P
[10:31] <Cyber_AfK> hmm
[10:31] <Cyber_AfK> it flashed up for a second
[10:31] <thoreauputic> LordSkylark: not sure what you mean - do you mean how to get the splash screen ?
[10:31] <Cyber_AfK> i have no idea if its running or not now :/
[10:32] <Cyber_AfK> yea it didnt work
[10:32] <Cyber_AfK> i wonder why, must be ~/
[10:32] <LordSkylark> the whole grub graphics including the list where i can choose what os to start
[10:32] <thoreauputic> Cyber_AfK: thinking aloud again?
=== XiXaQ_ is now known as XiXaQ
[10:32] <LordSkylark> i noticed hat menu.lst is still present and ok
[10:33] <Cyber_AfK> duh, what else would i by typing for :P
[10:33] <thoreauputic> LordSkylark: grub should do that - why did you need to reinstall it?
[10:33] <LordSkylark> i had trouble with my MBR
[10:33] <LordSkylark> and grub vanished
[10:33] <PORDO> what's with this?
[10:33] <PORDO> gnome-volume-control: symbol lookup error: gnome-volume-control: undefined symbol: __gst_debug_min
[10:34] <LordSkylark> then i tried grub-install from a live cd and grub reappeared
[10:34] <DarkED> why is ubuntu not automounting my external hdd?
[10:34] <LordSkylark> but only with minimal command line
[10:34] <thoreauputic> LordSkylark: did you install to /dev/hda or /dev/hda1 ( for example) ? /dev/hda is the one for the MBR
[10:34] <[3B> sup all
[10:34] <LordSkylark> no graphic and no list
[10:34] <LordSkylark> ;(
[10:34] <Cyber_AfK> lol thoreauputic "right click - create link" owns j00
[10:34] <Jiraiya> Tout  fait d'accord
[10:34] <Cyber_AfK> no launcher needed, shortcut on desktop ftw :P
[10:34] <thoreauputic> Cyber_AfK: ?
[10:34] <LordSkylark> i used grub-install /dev/hda
[10:34] <frogzoo> DarkED: u sure it isn't? looked in /media?
[10:34] <thoreauputic> LordSkylark: OK
[10:34] <DarkED> frogzoo, yep
[10:34] <[3B> there is some1 there who could help me out to set oident to can connect to quakenet network _
[10:34] <DarkED> frogzoo, it's not even seeing it...
[10:35] <Kubo> hi anyone have connect linux to microsoft exchange server on LAN connection
[10:35] <thoreauputic> Cyber_AfK: i don't lower myself to usng point and click solutions *grin*
[10:35] <DarkED> frogzoo, my usb mouse works okay so i doubt its a usb problem

[10:35] <zigovr> hi all, is that possible to compile the kernel with "-j" option of make to use two processors ?
[10:35] <Cyber_AfK> you know some people would concider your wittyness rude
[10:35] <LordSkylark> :D
[10:35] <Cyber_AfK> that goodness im not some people :P
[10:35] <amphacid> i'm back
[10:35] <DarkED> would the filesystem have anything to do with it?
[10:35] <Cyber_AfK> thank*
[10:35] <[3B> wb >D
[10:36] <[3B> so , there is any1 who could help me setting oident to connect quakenet network ?
[10:36] <thoreauputic> LordSkylark: have you tried update-grub ? ( warning: long time since I messed with grub so check)
[10:36] <amphacid> I've managed to install with the alternate cd but my hd is mounted on /dev/sda... i dont't understand
[10:36] <LordSkylark> mmmh
[10:36] <LordSkylark> i think not ^^'
[10:36] <[3B> i have tryed to connect to quakenet but it say: User may have por 113 open, and set ident.. but i have no idea how to do it, im kinda new with linux
[10:36] <LordSkylark> thanks thoreauputic ;)
[10:37] <[3B> i already go the port opened but i dont know how to set the ident >S
[10:37] <[3B> got*
[10:37] <thoreauputic> LordSkylark: thank me if it works :) No guarantee - I'm no grub guru :)
[10:37] <DarkED> and also, i could have sworn there was an option for removeable media in the settings menus
[10:37] <DarkED> (gnome/xfce)
[10:38] <thoreauputic> [3B: try installing gidentd and forwarding port 113 to your box
[10:38] <hoth67> Kubo: I think Samba managed to connect the 2 worlds. Dono if it's what you want. check http://us1.samba.org/samba/
[10:38] <foo> I built a new system.. this is the second motherboard... having a strange issue. When I boot up the system, sometimes ethernet works, sometimes it doesn't. Any ideas? mii-tool shows link status ok sometimes, othertimes no interfaces found. The lights are showing up fine on the onboard LAN connection.
[10:38] <LordSkylark> thoreauputic thank you for the help :) if it will not work i will come back here and ask again :P
[10:38] <[3B> thoreauputic, i installed oident, so should i try gident _
[10:38] <[3B> ?
[10:38] <thoreauputic> [3B: I just suggested it because it works for me
[10:38] <[3B> okay, i will try
[10:38] <[3B> can i get it via apt _
[10:38] <[3B> ?
[10:38] <thoreauputic> yes
[10:39] <[3B> ty, i will try it out
[10:39] <thoreauputic> !gidentd
[10:39] <ubotu> gidentd: RFC1413 compliant IPv4/IPv6 ident daemon. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.4.5-7.2 (edgy), package size 19 kB, installed size 136 kB
[10:39] <idlemind> night all
[10:40] <[3B> thoreauputic once i get it installed, how do i set it ?
[10:41] <thoreauputic> [3B: from memory, it just starts - but you need to forward port 113 if you are behind a NAT router or firewall
[10:42] <thoreauputic> [3B: I installed it ages ago but i think that's right
[10:42] <[3B> allright, so i may open the port
[10:42] <[3B> on the router
[10:42] <[3B> ill do that :D
[10:42] <thoreauputic> [3B: direct the port to your local IP , yes
[10:42] <[3B> yah i know :D
[10:42] <thoreauputic> OK
[10:42] <[3B> setting router its not a problem :D
[10:42] <[3B> but im new on linux :D
[10:43] <thoreauputic> :)
[10:43] <[3B> i tried out oident, but it didnt work
[10:43] <thoreauputic> [3B: welcome to Freedom :)
[10:43] <[3B> hehe, thanks :)
[10:43] <[3B> i have been 2 days setting the ati drivers !
[10:44] <[3B> toke me reading 5 FAQS to make em work right
[10:44] <thoreauputic> [3B: if it fails to start, run  sudo /etc/init.d/gidentd rstart
[10:44] <[3B> restart i think u mean _
[10:44] <thoreauputic> but it should start by default ...
[10:44] <[3B> i see
[10:44] <thoreauputic> oops
[10:44] <[3B> let me try
[10:44] <thoreauputic> restart yes
[10:44] <[3B> ya ya i got it :)
[10:45] <thoreauputic> normally daemons start on install in Ubuntu/Debian
[10:45] <[3B> isnt Edgy?
[10:45] <[3B> Ubunty/Edgy ?
[10:46] <thoreauputic> [3B: ?
[10:46] <[3B> nvm :D
[10:46] <[3B> well, its not working, :S
[10:46] <thoreauputic> oh I see - i was just pointing out that Ubuntu does things the Debian Way
[10:47] <PORDO> anyone know about this bug? undefined symbol: __gst_debug_min
[10:47] <thoreauputic> [3B: hmm - try restarting the network perhaps ( it should work as far as I know)
[10:47] <[3B> yeah , ubuntu does debian things
=== y_kuznetsov is now known as P4
[10:47] <[3B> oki
=== P4 is now known as Gleb
[10:48] <thoreauputic> [3B: perhaps your router needs to be rebooted to make the forwarding work - routers are sometimes brain dead like that
[10:49] <niru> Is there any package in kde for getting 3d features

[10:58] <thoreauputic> [3B: regarding gidentd - try looking at the man page - i might have it wrong ( I forget if I needed to configure it, but I don't think so)
[10:58] <[3B> yaeh

[10:58] <[3B> i did work for me
[10:58] <PORDO> is there some way of resetting your asound.state file?
[10:59] <PORDO> i don't understand why sound is so damned complicated in ubuntu.  every time i upgrade, getting sound to work again is a nightmare.
[10:59] <lkjaslkjfasldkfj> 10x vry much, next time u see me here will be when I have set it up at home
[10:59] <[3B> hehehe
[10:59] <[3B> also lkjaslkjfasldkfj
[10:59] <[3B> read the troubleshootings

[11:02] <Alarm> hello i tried to instal java from the package manager, everything goes actually fine. till a point that the installation stopped. so i pressed on details and so that it shows the license aggrement, but it seems that it doesnt accept neither "enter" nor "yes" so the installation doesnt go forward. some how i dont have access in the console window or i dont know what else
[11:02] <Alarm> actually thats what i see: Operating System Distributor License for Java v1.1 (DLJ)
[11:02] <Alarm> plus more text

[11:03] <sirmis> how i can force apt-get to install packages ?
[11:03] <PORDO> echosystm my professional audio mixer (maudio delta) works fine.
[11:03] <sirmis> i'm know what i'm doing ;)
[11:03] <PORDO> always.
[11:03] <PORDO> it's the spdif i guess.
[11:03] <Kitro> hi all
[11:03] <PORDO> that's my problem.
[11:03] <stefg> Here comes a funny one: I've bought a backlit keyboard, and found that the light on/off is done via the 'scroll lock'  key (so the back-light is basically a giant scroll-lock LED). this works in win, because it obviously ignores the key. But in X it doesn't work, because IMHO X is somhow reading the key. In console the light goes on and off, but if the light is on (scroll lock state) the...
[11:03] <stefg> ...scroll is, of course, locked. Which files do i have to hack to make Linux ignore the scroll lock key (like win does)?
[11:03] <[3B> thoreauputic,  shall i try with pidentd ?
[11:04] <PORDO> how do i get a new asound.state?
[11:04] <PORDO> it's like i always have to update that when i upgrade my ubuntu..
[11:04] <thoreauputic> [3B: running out of ideas... why not? You never know...
[11:04] <Lynoure> sirmis: have you tried with  --force-yes ?

[11:04] <Gleb> The command net rpc join -U user%pass write ' error setting trust account password: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED'/ What I made wrong?

[11:05] <Lynoure> sirmis: What are you installing anyway?

[11:07] <shiftmeister> i have a question plz
[11:07] <Flannel> max_: probably because CDemu is using bash specific commands, and the default interpretter in ubuntu is dash.  Edit the script, change the first line to /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh

[11:10] <Flannel> max_: er, wait.  that's silly.  makefiles aren't bash scripts.  I don't know.  Try asking the CDemu people, they'd know.
[11:10] <japser> i have a toshiba laptop with an ati x700 pcie
[11:10] <Flannel> max_: makefile is a file, it'd be opening it in an editor, but, look for a script in that folder.

[11:11] <Flannel> max_: edit the makefile, it'll most likely call a script, that script is most likely it.
[11:11] <max_> Flannel: i have the makefile open, what am i changing?
[11:11] <Lynoure> sirmis: oh, sorry, I was morningish. But yeah, try with force-yes, but I do not know anything about mepis, so #mepis might have better advice
[11:11] <Flannel> max_: nothing in the makefile, youre lookng for a script being called by the makefile

[11:15] <ubotu> vaineh: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[11:16] <dgold> vaineh - some wmvs are drm-encrypted at source - you will not be able to play these back on Linux
[11:16] <Flannel> max_: good.  Well, then it's an error in the script.  You'll have to ask the CDemu people for specifics
[11:16] <max_> is there an IRC room?
[11:16] <majnoon> oops
[11:16] <Flannel> max_: not on freenode.  Or at least, not named "cdemu", check their website/etc
[11:16] <sirmis> --force-yes not seems to work
[11:17] <max_> is there another program similiar to
[11:17] <momal> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37894/ <-- can anyone help me >_<... trouble installing libqt4-dev
[11:17] <sirmis> interesting ..
[11:17] <max_> CDemu?
[11:17] <Flannel> max_: I have no idea what CDemu does ;)
[11:17] <max_> mounts iso's to a virtual drive
[11:17] <Flannel> oh.  Why... not just use mount?
[11:17] <Flannel> !iso
[11:17] <frogzoo> max_: why cdemu? can you just mount an iso?
[11:17] <ubotu> To mount an ISO disc image, type "sudo mount -o loop my.iso <mountpoint>" There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before burning.
[11:17] <max_> theres a normal mount?
=== Tidus is now known as Kimahri
[11:18] <max_> i knew that, i was testing you
=== Kimahri is now known as Rikku
[11:18] <frogzoo> max_: if you have an iso, mounting's a piece of cake
[11:18] <max_> when it says mountpoint its talking about a directory correct?
[11:18] <majnoon> [3B: sorry
[11:18] <Flannel> max_: correct
[11:18] <thoreauputic> [3B: sorry, in another chan - as far as i can see the /etc/gidentd.conf file is not doing anything, according to the man page
=== Rikku is now known as Tidus
[11:19] <majnoon> [3B: sorry i'm using the "radeon" drivers and had to do glxinfo instead
[11:20] <thoreauputic> [3B: mone just has comments in it

[11:34] <Blake1> hi, I'm trying to install the ATI drivers, but i keep getting "OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: www.mesa3d.org
[11:34] <Blake1> " when I type "fglrxinfo" in the terminal. How can I fix this?
[11:34] <japser> same problem here blake
[11:34] <tamacracker> Does anyone know if I'm supposed to have this in the fstab?: /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0
[11:34] <japser> i did all the howto's rtfms
[11:35] <japser> tamacracker sure
[11:35] <japser> u can even mount it
[11:35] <tamacracker> nah it wont mount
[11:35] <tamacracker> that's why i don't know if that's correct
[11:35] <rcrook> is hda1 your windows partition?
[11:35] <tamacracker> yes
[11:35] <tamacracker> i wanna mount and write onto it :(
[11:35] <japser> in fstab u find a list of hda's or sda's u can mount
[11:36] <japser> sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
[11:36] <rcrook> is the ntfs kernel module installed?
[11:36] <japser> then u do cd /mnt
[11:36] <tamacracker> i have no diea...
[11:36] <tamacracker> idea..
[11:36] <japser> tamacracker sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
[11:36] <japser> then cd /mnt
[11:36] <rcrook> do what japser suggests
[11:36] <mdasilva> I'll think about it
[11:37] <tamacracker> macracker@tamacracker:~$ cd /mnt
[11:37] <tamacracker> bash: cd: /mnt: Permission denied
[11:37] <tamacracker> tamacracker@tamacracker:~$ sudo cd /mnt
[11:37] <tamacracker> sudo: cd: command not found
[11:37] <Blake1> I had it working perfectly in SUSE
[11:37] <tamacracker> ack
[11:37] <japser> tamacracker?? what command?
[11:37] <tamacracker> cd /mnt
[11:37] <tamacracker> then it said permission denied
[11:37] <tamacracker> then i did sudo cd /mnt
[11:37] <japser> first u did this? sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
[11:37] <tamacracker> yep
[11:38] <rcrook> do df -k
[11:38] <tamacracker> df -k?
[11:38] <rcrook> see what it says about /mnt
[11:39] <rcrook> df = disk free.
[11:39] <tamacracker> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37899/
[11:39] <rcrook> -k says to list sizes in kilobyte
[11:39] <_goofy_> im having a problem with a drive, well its a logic volume created with LVM2......i cant write to it after my system has been for an hour of so.......i get an error saying that the disk is write only disk
[11:39] <_goofy_> anyone have a clue
[11:40] <japser> thats goofy
[11:40] <tamacracker> mounted on /mnt?
[11:40] <japser> yup tamacracker
[11:40] <tamacracker> :\ i can't access my windows files
[11:40] <tamacracker> just an empty folder
[11:41] <rcrook> it mounted the filesystem ok
[11:41] <tamacracker> >.>
[11:41] <japser> and u did cd /mnt ?
[11:41] <rcrook> try just mount and see what it says about hda1
[11:41] <tamacracker> yeah
[11:41] <japser> or sudo cd /mnt ?
[11:42] <tamacracker> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37900/
[11:42] <boobyff> hello, I am folowing a guide on the internet to use the ATI drives, but I get Mesa messages or something
[11:43] <tamacracker> tamacracker@tamacracker:~$ cd /mnt
[11:43] <tamacracker> bash: cd: /mnt: Permission denied
[11:43] <klotho> hello, I just installed 6.10 on a Thinkpad T23 and the wireless card isn't working... how do I tell if the driver is correctly loaded?
[11:43] <klotho> lshw shows it assigned
[11:43] <rcrook> tamacracker: it did mount the file system ok but it will have mounted it with root as owner
[11:43] <jron> hello, i was wondering where one changes file type actions for xfce... i am interested in trying to get .torrents to open with utorrent through wine.
[11:44] <tamacracker> i don't understand.
[11:44] <tamacracker> as of now
[11:44] <rcrook> tamacracker: thats why you cant access it as your standard user
[11:44] <tamacracker> it mounted, but it became a folder, not a hard drive icon... and there's no files in it
[11:44] <malv> how would I go about creating my own custom ubuntu cds easily
[11:44] <rcrook> sudo umount /mnt
[11:44] <rcrook> one sec
[11:44] <malv> e.g. I pick the packages and settings I want
[11:45] <tamacracker> sudo umount /mnt <- use that now?
[11:45] <rcrook> yes
[11:46] <klotho> anyone have any idea how to tell if a device driver is loading?
[11:46] <japser> yes
[11:46] <rcrook> you need to mount it as your user. so you can access it
[11:46] <tamacracker> now it became a hard drive icon :D
[11:46] <tamacracker> forgive me for my ignorance, but how would i go about that?
[11:46] <rcrook> the fstab entry I use  looks like this ->> /dev/hda2 /local/winxp ntfs defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,auto,ro,nouser 0 0
[11:47] <rcrook> uid=1000 give me ownership of the file system so I dont need to do everything to it as root
[11:47] <tamacracker>  /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0    <- looks nothin like that
[11:48] <tamacracker> this is the site someone told me to use as directions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/
[11:48] <rcrook> btw... the ntfs dev team says use write mode at your own risk. just letting you know
[11:48] <tamacracker> and again... i've been misleaded lol
[11:48] <tamacracker> yeah i need it to transfer files
[11:49] <tamacracker> when i use windows, my windows doesn't recognize my 2nd hard drive, which is linux.
[11:49] <tamacracker> rcrook
[11:50] <tamacracker> should i just use this: ntfs defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,auto,ro,nouser 0 0
[11:50] <rcrook> anyway tamacracker, use my entry as a template. you should then be able to access your winows stuff.:)
[11:50] <tamacracker> instead of ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0
[11:50] <rcrook> you need to check you uid... just run id at your prompt
[11:50] <rcrook> change the ro to rw for write access
[11:51] <tamacracker> type "id" into terminal>?
[11:51] <rcrook> the gid your should use it that of your user
[11:51] <tamacracker> uid=1000(tamacracker) gid=1000(tamacracker) groups=4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),109(lpadmin),111(scanner),114(admin),1000(tamacracker)
[11:52] <finn> hi
[11:52] <rcrook> and the last thing you need to do is change the ownership of where you are mounting it... sudu chown tamacracker:tamacracker /media/hda1 for example.
[11:52] <rcrook> then you  can use what I have put in mine
[11:52] <klotho> if I want to edit a system file using a graphical editor, can I sudo the editor somehow or what do I do?
[11:53] <tamacracker> uh..
[11:53] <malv> for some reason the gnome desktop in centos 4.4 feels a lot smoother than ubuntu. Anyone know why?
[11:53] <tamacracker> ok type sudo chown tamacracker:tamacracker /media/hda1 ?
[11:53] <malv> noticeably more responsive
[11:53] <tamacracker> then use ntfs defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,auto,ro,nouser 0 0
[11:53] <tamacracker> with the rw
[11:53] <tamacracker> and save the fstab
[11:53] <finn> I would like to install ubuntu, but without most of the programms it brings with it.  is there a way to install it similar to the way the debian netinstall workes?
[11:53] <finn> works*
[11:53] <rcrook> yup.. should work
[11:53] <tamacracker> sudo mount /mnt ?
[11:53] <tamacracker> then that ^&
[11:54] <finn> start of with a very basic system and then get everything I need myself?
[11:54] <rcrook> no sudo mount /media/hda1
[11:54] <klotho> rcrook, do you know the answer to my last question?
[11:54] <tamacracker> ok
[11:54] <klotho> if I want to edit a system file using a graphical editor, can I sudo the editor somehow or what do I do?
[11:54] <Bojacob> anyone able to help me with ati's lovely fglrx driver?
[11:54] <tomix> anyone tell me how to get round the problem of hyphens in usernames with ftp
[11:54] <tomix> ?
[11:54] <rcrook> klotho: it should yes
[11:55] <klotho> rcook: so how to do it?
[11:55] <tomix> if i try to connect to the ftp server in question using the username asd-asd then it only recognises the second half
[11:55] <rcrook> if I want to edit /etc/hosts I would sudo kate /etc/hosts
[11:55] <finn> because to me it seems there are only very bloated installations available
[11:55] <tamacracker> rcrook
[11:55] <finn> or can they be customized during the process?
[11:56] <tamacracker> that didn't work
[11:56] <tamacracker> do need to restart X?
[11:56] <rcrook> ley me see your fstab
[11:56] <tamacracker> ok
[11:56] <rcrook> no tamacracker
[11:56] <klotho> rcook: I want to edit the files using the graphical editors, not from a terminal
[11:56] <tamacracker>  /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 ntfs defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,auto,rw,nouser 0 0
[11:57] <rcrook> klotho: that will start a graphical editor..
[11:57] <klotho> edit starts a graphical editor?
[11:57] <finn> anybody?
[11:57] <rcrook> no kate does
[11:58] <klotho> no manual entry for kate
[11:58] <rcrook> tamacracker: what error did you see when you tried mounting it?
[11:58] <klotho> which kate returns nothing
[11:58] <rcrook> hmmm....
[11:58] <klotho> do I have to install it?
[11:58] <rcrook> one sec
[11:59] <tamacracker> ok check it
[11:59] <tamacracker> as of now
[11:59] <klotho> I really want to be able to use the file browser and double click to sudo edit a file
[11:59] <tamacracker> i can access my files from windows
[11:59] <tamacracker> but when i try to create a folder
[11:59] <tamacracker> this is what i get: Could not make folder /media/hda1/New Folder
[11:59] <rcrook> klotho: gedit instead of kate
[12:00] <Bojacob> should I just screw fglrx and run radeon drivers instead?  I'm having a nightmare getting OpenGL to work
[12:00] <tamacracker> it's mounted, it's just not writeable
[12:00] <rcrook> tamacracker: if you ls -l /media/hda1 what do you get?
[12:00] <momal> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37894/ | Anyone I can't get libqt4-dev to install and I need it.. HELP
[12:00] <max_> i just removed a 2gb partition, is there anyway to add this to my main partition without having to reinstall? or make the partition show up as a second drive
[12:00] <Bojacob> jeez no ATI fans apparently hehe
[12:00] <[3B> Hi again
[12:01] <klotho> rcook: thanks a lot! But is there a way to make the file browser have the ability to start sudo gedit?
[12:01] <tamacracker> all my folders from my windows HD
[12:01] <tamacracker> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37901/
[12:01] <rcrook> klotho: i have a suggestion but its dangerous
[12:01] <klotho> is it? why?
[12:02] <rcrook> you could sudo nautilus but beware as you will be rinnung the file browser as root. you could accidentally delete files you shouldnt
[12:02] <tamacracker> brb i need to get  drink of water
[12:03] <klotho> I'd rather that the file browser did a sudo gedit filename when I doubleclick. Is that possible?
[12:03] <rcrook> you could add the function to nautilus but I dont know how to do that as I use kde not gnome.
[12:04] <finn> I think I found the sollution myself
[12:04] <aradia> hello i need help with updating to the latest nvidia driver
[12:04] <finn> the "alternate CD" might give me what I want
[12:04] <karakara> is there a command i can use to check out what video card i got?
[12:04] <guillem101> klotho, you might create a nautilus script for that
[12:04] <aradia> hello i need help with updating to the latest nvidia driver! they provided a driver installer that is freaking hard to use
[12:04] <aradia> now my x cant start lol
[12:05] <klotho> hmm... okay, thanks for the hint anyway
[12:05] <rcrook> tamacracker: I think it may be that the ntfs module is read only.. you may need to use the ntfs-g3
[12:05] <guillem101> klotho, google for nautilus scripts....
[12:06] <klotho> okay, thanks for the hint guillem101
[12:06] <aradia> i need help with updating to the latest nvidia driver! they provided a driver installer that is freaking hard to use and now my x cant start
[12:07] <[3B> Aradia what dist are u using _
[12:07] <FiFo> hi all
[12:07] <aradia> im on edgy
[12:07] <FiFo> why is ubuntu the best distro?
[12:07] <[3B> Aradia
[12:07] <[3B> u should try to dl automaxi2
[12:07] <klotho> dang, I just control-Ced the gedit session without saving my file, and now when I do sudo gedit file it just returns rather than running gedit.
[12:07] <[3B> and install nvidia drivers from there
[12:07] <[3B> it should work
[12:07] <klotho> I don't see gedit running in a ps...
[12:07] <klotho> what's going on?
[12:08] <aradia> does automatix2 have the latest nvidia driver?
[12:08] <FiFo> why is ubuntu the best distro?
[12:08] <[3B> not sure, i use ATI
[12:08] <[3B> but for what i heard the drivers from automatix works right
[12:08] <karakara> is there a command i can use to check out what video card i got?
[12:08] <aradia> ah ok
[12:08] <[3B> dunno if they are the latests
[12:08] <aradia> thnx i 'll try it out
[12:08] <tamacracker> rcrook
[12:08] <[3B> np
[12:08] <tamacracker> before, i used fuse
[12:08] <tamacracker> do you think that fuse might be gettin in the way?
[12:09] <guillem101> klotho, I guess you want a mixture of http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/nautilus-scripts/Execute/Misc/gedit and http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/nautilus-scripts/Execute/Open%20terminal/root-terminal-here
[12:10] <aradia> does anyone know why sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx will remove nvidia-xconfig and apt-get install nvidia-xconfig will remove nvidia-glx? funny thing is on the websites they always ask to apt-get install nvidia-glx then nvidia-xconfig
[12:11] <frog> hi, sry for beeing stupid, but if i wanna boot & install from cd i build the packages and make iso. how about if i wanna boot & install from usb? (i mean i wish to have usb install stick)

[12:21] <tamacracker> and i dunno how i did it
[12:23] <[3B> karakara,  check my query
[12:23] <rcrook> tamacracker: I am checking this out on my box atm.. the ntfs kernel module is read only.
[12:23] <rcrook> just installing the g3 drivers now
[12:24] <tamacracker> g3 drivers?
[12:24] <[3B> ntfs-3g
[12:24] <[3B> i think he means that
[12:24] <karakara> what query? o_o

[12:25] <[3B> well
[12:25] <[3B> tell me what line u used on ur fstab
[12:25] <guillem101> klotho, just place the scripts (and your modified versions) at ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts
[12:26] <tamacracker> rcrook
[12:26] <guillem101> klotho, you can reach there by scripts->open scripts folder menu entry
[12:26] <tamacracker> for some reason
[12:26] <tamacracker> i dont have the 3g drivers installed
[12:26] <tamacracker> >.>
[12:26] <tamacracker> ok 3B
[12:26] <guillem101> klotho,  if you create folders there, your scripts menu will contain submenus, etc.
[12:26] <rcrook> tamacracker: this works for  me when I install the ntfs-3g driver
[12:26] <tamacracker> it does?
[12:26] <rcrook> /dev/hda2 /local/winxp ntfs-3g defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,auto,rw,nouser 0 0
[12:26] <tamacracker> ok im gonna install it then
[12:27] <[3B> well

[12:54] <guillem101> klotho, for some reason, scripts menu only appears if you have something inside the scripts folder, so place the scripts at .gnome2/nautilus-scripts and form that moment you will have the scripts menu.
[12:54] <JoeKilner> Flannel: thanks that looks more promising.
[12:55] <klotho> guillem101: thanks! I saw that. But it won't run for some reason

[01:07] <Empiric> from kubuntu gdm.conf file
[01:07] <vanberge> aradia, click on both of those, and select them to 're-install'

[01:11] <Flannel> nuxil: yeah, you'll have to set up a 32bit chroot or whatever.  As to how that's done... I'm clueless.
[01:11] <DjViper> klotho: not all of them
[01:11] <un_operateur> nuxil, ahh, i dont think a 64bit rar exists
[01:11] <klotho> also do a search to see if there are any notes about your card with 6.10 or whatever version
[01:11] <klotho> on the forum, etc.
[01:12] <klotho> I just had to disable a driver.... which is definitely not a user-friendly installation
[01:12] <nuxil> crapety crap..
[01:12] <joumetal> max_sudo fsck /dev/hd??
[01:12] <DjViper> klotho: how did you do taht?
[01:12] <DjViper> that*

[01:13] <vanberge> aradia, i have the 6200 card...   i have nvidia-glx.  nvidia-common-... then some xorg-nv package.
[01:13] <Flannel> !chroot | nuxil
[01:13] <ubotu> nuxil: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot use this to build 32 bit environments on a 64 bit box
[01:13] <klotho> edited /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[01:13] <vanberge> aradia, and my driver in xorg.conf just says 'nvidia'
[01:13] <Flannel> nuxil: that might be of some assistance
[01:13] <nuxil> Flannel, :)
[01:13] <un_operateur> Flannel, how would chroot help?
[01:13] <rapid> if the nvidia driver is not working i found the "nv" driver worked well.
[01:14] <nuxil> Flannel, last Q,, im on dapper.. is ther ant point in upgrading to edgy ? i see not so much new stuff in edgy
[01:14] <klotho> rapid: I installed the application, but where does it appear so I can run it?
[01:14] <star_this> is there any tool to visualy view /var/log/messages ?
[01:14] <vanberge> nuxil, imo, wireless support is better..  :-)
[01:14] <un_operateur> nuxil, some packages have newer releases on edgy
[01:14] <aradia> vanberge: i changed vesa to nv and ubuntu keeps restarting
[01:15] <nuxil> un_operateur, yes,, some..
[01:15] <vanberge> aradia, change to 'nvidia'
[01:15] <rapid> kloto: kwifimanagers for kde. take a look in your internet applcations?
[01:15] <DjViper> klotho: can I msg you ?
[01:15] <aradia> vanberge: ok
[01:15] <vanberge> aradia, X does?  or the whole operating s ystem?
[01:15] <klotho> DjViper: I'm no expert...
[01:15] <bimberi> star_this: System -> Admin -> System Log
[01:15] <rapid> klotho, from the console try a kwifimanager
[01:15] <klotho> it wasn't exactly that name
[01:15] <DjViper> klotho: ok
[01:15] <klotho> do installed applications appear somewhere?
[01:15] <aradia> vanberge: i think its the whole operating system... after i start x i get a screen full of '-' hyphens then the os restarts
[01:16] <aradia> vanberge: now its restarting
[01:16] <dballester> hi to all
[01:16] <vanberge> aradia, ok
[01:16] <klotho> I installed it using synaptic
[01:16] <vanberge> aradia, can you get to a point of changing the xorg conf?
[01:16] <aradia> vanberge: now i cant
[01:16] <aradia> vanberge: i get a blank screen after the ubuntu loading screen
[01:17] <aradia> vanberge: now i see a screen full of dashes
[01:17] <rapid> klotho, they appear whereever they've been installed to, but you've just installed a kde app under gnome <shrug>
[01:17] <aradia> vanberge: i haven got into x yet
[01:17] <mneptok> aradia: boot to recovery mode and edit xorg.conf
[01:17] <aradia> mneptok: ok let me try
[01:17] <klotho> rapid: it downloaded all these kde dependancies
[01:17] <vanberge> aradia
[01:18] <rapid> klotho, go into a console and press kwifi then press tab
[01:18] <mneptok> aradia: do you actually have an nVidia card to use the nVidia binary blob drivers?
[01:18] <vanberge> aradia, ctrl alt f1
[01:18] <infamousbasher> nigger
[01:18] <aradia> mneptok: wats a binary blob driver
[01:18] <klotho> rapid: I'm installing it from the add/remove thingy
[01:18] <aradia> vanberge: hey ctrl alt f1 works, but its restarting now

[01:19] <vanberge> aradia, hit whatever button gets you to ubuntu's grub menu and boot into failsafe mode
[01:19] <vanberge> aradia, does that make sense?  :-)
[01:19] <un_operateur> !mplayer

[01:19] <aradia> vanberge: yea i selected the recovery mode
[01:19] <vanberge> aradia, ok
[01:19] <vanberge> that should get us to a stable boot
[01:20] <vanberge> aradia, how did you install the nvidia drivers?  did you download from nvdiia's site?  or do from synaptic?
[01:20] <vanberge> aradia, o you said apt....
[01:20] <vanberge> sorry
[01:21] <mneptok> aradia: what package did you install?
[01:21] <aradia> vanberge: np
[01:21] <aradia> vanberge: but after the apt, i downloaded the installer from nvidia site
[01:21] <klotho> so when I sleep my T23 and then wake it, the network doesn't come back
[01:21] <klotho> anyone have any ideas on that?
[01:21] <aradia> vanberge: then i dl the kernel header, and ran the nvidia installer
[01:21] <aradia> vanberge: in the mid of installation, there was some error, and then x cant start
[01:22] <aradia> vanberge: then i tried apt again but it didnt work
[01:22] <vanberge> aradia, if we did re-install on the nvidia packages from synaptic, we might be ok
[01:22] <mneptok> aradia: you should use one or the other. either the drivers from the repos or nVidia's. not both.
[01:22] <vanberge> mneptok, i think he realizes such.  :-)
[01:22] <vanberge> he's been trying to fix X for 7 hours
[01:22] <aradia> vanberge mneptok: i also have a error about api mismatch
[01:23] <vanberge> aradia, where?
[01:23] <aradia> vanberge mneptok: different version of driver for x and nvidia module or something
[01:23] <aradia> vanberge mneptok: i get that error when i start x
[01:23] <krampo> Hello, I'm thinking about new laptop. Does anyone has experience with nVidia chipsets + GeForce 6100 + XGL?
[01:23] <vanberge> aradia, yeah, the nvidia intaller you ran overwrote the kernel module that apt installed
[01:23] <krampo> it should wokr
[01:23] <vanberge> aradia, did you get ubuntu to boot stable?
[01:24] <aradia> vanberge: im at the command line
[01:24] <compengi> krampo, what's the problem?
[01:24] <anorexicpillow> hah me too :P
[01:24] <vanberge> aradia, in xorg.conf, change "nv" to "nvidia"
[01:24] <compengi> hey gnomefreak
[01:24] <vanberge> aradia, or did you try that already?
[01:24] <gnomefreak> hi
[01:24] <aradia> vanberge: ok.. i just edited that
[01:24] <aradia> vanberge:  start x?
[01:24] <vanberge> aradia, reboot
[01:25] <vanberge> aradia, you're in recovery mode
[01:25] <max_> how can you restore a file you edited to its state before you modified it
[01:25] <one_kil> hi!
[01:25] <krampo> compengi: right now there's no problem :) I'm just thinking about new laptop and considering what kind of I should buy
[01:25] <aradia> vanberge: o ok i'll reboot
[01:25] <one_kil> if add a new module in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/... , why modinfo or modprobe cann't find it?
[01:25] <aradia> vanberge: cant recovery mode run x?
[01:25] <krampo> compengi: I have Beryl working on GeForce2 GTS at home
[01:25] <krampo> compengi: guess it should work on GeForce laptop also
[01:25] <aradia> vanberge: btw is it possible to cancel that disk check on every 30 boots
[01:26] <aradia> vanberge: cancel as in abort
[01:26] <michiel_> can I use linux-source as linux-headers?
[01:26] <vanberge> aradia, im actually not sure....  i always just let it run
[01:26] <aradia> vanberge: k
[01:26] <fdr> hello... I've just bought a new lcd monitor that supports dvi input (my previous CRT didn't) -- how do I set X so that dvi output is enabled? thank you!
[01:26] <vanberge> aradia, plus i don't reboot my comp very often  :-(
[01:26] <aradia> vanberge: i think tats nice :)
[01:26] <frogzoo> michiel_: the same
[01:27] <gnomefreak> michiel_: no just use the headers (really all someone will need unless building modules
[01:27] <vanberge> aradia, hopefully you wont have to after we fix X
[01:27] <vanberge> heh
[01:27] <frogzoo> michiel_: you can also use linux-headers
[01:27] <vanberge> aradia, did it boot yet??   :-)
[01:27] <aradia> vanberge: after changing 'nv' to 'nvidia' i get the blue error screen
[01:27] <michiel_> frogzoo: I don't have linux-headers package for this kernel version
[01:27] <aradia> vanberge: faile to start x server
=== compengi_ is now known as compengi
[01:28] <aradia> vanberge: failed to initialize glx module
[01:28] <frogzoo> michiel_: well source will do fine
[01:28] <michiel_> frogzoo:  but I'll try to create a symlink to linux-source
[01:28] <gnomefreak> aradia: did you install the linux-restricted-modules package for your kernel
[01:28] <vanberge> aradia, thats ok
[01:28] <compengi> how are you gnomefreak
[01:28] <aradia> vanberge: api mismatch and failed to initialize nvidia kernel module
[01:28] <gnomefreak> compengi: fine
[01:28] <aradia> gnomefreak: yes i did that via apt-get
[01:28] <gnomefreak> aradia: ah that error
[01:28] <r4wbeRRy> hi
[01:29] <r4wbeRRy> i've a problem with automatix2's installation
[01:29] <vanberge> hmmm.....   aradia can you do me a favor?  change the 'nvidia' back to vesa so you can get into X... then passte t he contents of your xorg log into a pastebin?
[01:29] <gnomefreak> aradia: have you ever installed nvidia drivers from nvidia.com or a 3rd party repo?
[01:29] <gnomefreak> reverseblade: see #automatix
[01:29] <gnomefreak> ack
[01:29] <reverseblade> gnomefreak, _?
[01:29] <aradia> gnomefreak: i installed via apt-get, then used nvidia installer but it failed
[01:29] <vanberge> gnomefreak, he did both actually it sounds like
[01:29] <gnomefreak> r4wbeRRy: see #automatix
[01:29] <aradia> vanberge: k i'll change that
[01:29] <r4wbeRRy> i followed this http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Baustelle/Automatix2?highlight=(automatix2) (sry 4 german) and this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37905/ came out.
[01:29] <gnomefreak> reverseblade: tab mess up
[01:29] <r4wbeRRy> okay, i'll see
[01:29] <reverseblade> gnomefreak, never let that happen again
[01:30] <reverseblade> gnomefreak, ;)
[01:30] <vanberge> gnomefreak, any ideas here?  i thought if i had him re-intall nvidia-glx and nvidia common from synaptic that would fix him
[01:30] <vanberge> but it seems not have
[01:30] <gnomefreak> aradia: you need to get rid of everything related to nvidia-glx and l-r-m- packages and reinstall the ones from your repos
[01:30] <dballester> I'm investigating if someone more than me had problems with the stored locations using Network Seetings GUI. After Edgy 'automatic' upgrades on Saturday/Sunday, i lost all my stored network locations ( several EISSD/WEP pairs ). Anyone with the same problem?
[01:30] <gnomefreak> vanberge: its the l-r-m packages that are clashing
[01:30] <aradia> gnomefreak: how do i get rid of everything?
[01:30] <vanberge> gnomefreak, ahh....
[01:31] <aradia> vanberge: im inside x
[01:31] <gnomefreak> aradia: synaptic easiest way
[01:31] <vanberge> aradia, i was out of ideas... so lets have gnomefreak help us
[01:31] <gnomefreak> reverseblade: ;)
[01:31] <vanberge> :-)
[01:31] <aradia> vanberge: k
[01:31] <aradia> gnomefreak: wats l-r-m
[01:31] <gnomefreak> vanberge: i have seen every possible nvidia error ;)
[01:31] <vanberge> linux restricted modules
[01:31] <gnomefreak> l-r-m == linux-restricted-modules
[01:31] <aradia> how do i remove l-r-m
[01:32] <gnomefreak> aradia:  open synaptic
[01:32] <vanberge> gnomefreak, i have only seen a few... and ten a few ati errors
[01:32] <vanberge> ten = then
[01:32] <aradia> ok
[01:32] <gnomefreak> aradia: than click search and type linux-restricted-modules   in the search box
[01:32] <vanberge> aradia, if we fix you, you have to install beryl  :-P
[01:32] <zigovr> hi all, how can I configurate a script to be launched when my laptop goes out of suspend (I need to restart the wireless interface)
[01:32] <DjViper> how do I check if 3d driver is working?
[01:32] <gnomefreak> DjViper: glxinfo
[01:32] <aradia> vanberge: i installed beryl already lol
[01:32] <DjViper> gnomefreak: ati card
[01:32] <gnomefreak> DjViper: that would really depend on the card
[01:32] <frogzoo> DjViper: glxinfo |grep direct
[01:32] <zigovr> DjViper: also glxgears
[01:33] <gnomefreak> glxinfo should give you outptut for ati also
[01:33] <DjViper> direct rendering: yes
[01:33] <aradia> vanberge: do i mark for complete removal? or just removal
[01:33] <DjViper> good?
[01:33] <gnomefreak> yes
[01:33] <DjViper> okay
[01:33] <vanberge> gnomefreak, ?
[01:33] <gnomefreak> aradia: complete
[01:33] <gnomefreak> DjViper: yes
[01:33] <aradia> k
[01:33] <zigovr> you know why glxgears doesn't display the FPS on ubuntu by the way ?
[01:33] <frogzoo> DjViper: no, it's lying
[01:33] <vanberge> zigovr, i think there is a command line switch to do that?
[01:34] <gnomefreak> zigovr: it changed it used to but there are other commands to make it do that
[01:34] <zigovr> ah, but there aren't any man pages for gxlgears, how do  I find the option ?
[01:34] <spliffy_> glxgears --help?
[01:34] <r4wbeRRy> gnomefreak: in #automatix there're only 3 ppl, not answering
[01:35] <gnomefreak> r4wbeRRy: we dont support #automatix its not a ubuntu project
[01:35] <frogzoo> zigovr: /etc/acpi/ac.d/
[01:35] <r4wbeRRy> yes. but it might be that someone can help me
[01:35] <r4wbeRRy> therefore i'm asking
[01:35] <r4wbeRRy> or is this forbidden? O.o
[01:35] <frogzoo> zigovr: also look in /etc/default/acpi-support for the MODULES_LIST
[01:35] <gnomefreak> r4wbeRRy: i advise maybe do it by hand or join #easyubuntu and see if they can help you with thier product
[01:36] <vanberge> gnomefreak, after aradia does complete removal does he have to re-intstall nvidia glx and common?
[01:36] <zigovr> frogzoo: ah , many thanks
[01:36] <gnomefreak> r4wbeRRy: its very very offtopic in ubuntu channels and needs to stay in #automatix
[01:36] <aradia> vanberge gnomefreak:  i removed everything l-r-m and nvidia-glx.
[01:36] <HuibertGill> r4wbeRRy: automatix is known to break stuff, it is not an ubuntu project, sorry
[01:36] <gnomefreak> vanberge: i would check his sources.list file to make sure hes not gettting it froma  3rd party repo
[01:36] <zigovr> spliffy_: no, there aren't any --help option to glxgears, nor -help, -h , nothing
[01:37] <zigovr> no man pages either so I'm a bit stuck
[01:37] <r4wbeRRy> ok, i understand. ty.
[01:37] <vanberge> aradia, in synaptic go to repositories option and then click on 3rd party tab
[01:37] <wasabi__> hellp
[01:37] <aradia> vanberge: i disabled all 3rd partie repo
[01:37] <wasabi__> hello*
[01:37] <HuibertGill> !ask | wasabi__
[01:37] <ubotu> wasabi__: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:37] <aradia> vanberge: i reloaded synaptic
[01:37] <wasabi__> i need help. i downloaded a gtk2 theme from gnome look, but i don't know how to apply it. i know it's n00b but i'm pretty new if you can tell
[01:38] <gnomefreak> aradia: good now change the driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to either vesa or nv and than reboot
[01:38] <vanberge> gnomefreak, he should be good to go right iwht 3rd party repos disabled?
[01:38] <vanberge> gnomefreak, he's alrady in vesa
[01:38] <frogzoo> wasabi__: open  sys->prefs->themes & drag new theme in
[01:38] <wasabi__> http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=48087 that is the theme
[01:38] <gnomefreak> vanberge: i want a reboot to be sure
[01:38] <wasabi__> it's a gtkrc file though
[01:38] <HuibertGill> wasabi__: a buton in preferences/themes is called "install a theme"
[01:38] <aradia> gnomefreak: im in vesa, and nv shows a screen full of hyphens
[01:38] <gnomefreak> he might need to reboot again but lately nvidia and rebooting has gone hand in hand :(
[01:38] <aradia> k
[01:39] <luisito> hellos
[01:39] <vanberge> gnomefreak,  lol yeah good point
[01:39] <wasabi__> no that doesn't work
[01:39] <luisito> I want to know how good does ubuntu run in a
[01:39] <e4twood> list
[01:39] <luisito> G3 ibook?
[01:39] <wasabi__> HuibertGill, it's not a metacity theme
[01:39] <LookTJ> what is the command to show the version of your gtk version?
[01:39] <wasabi__> HuibertGill, i think you need to look at the file to know what i'm talking about
[01:40] <luisito> I want to know how good does ubuntu run in a G3 ibook?
[01:40] <gnomefreak> LookTJ: apt-cache policy but i think the right name of package is libgtk2.0
[01:40] <HuibertGill> wasabi__: the theme preference handles metacity / gtk / and meta themes.
[01:41] <gnomefreak> luisito: should run fine i know others that have used it on imacs
[01:41] <lynucs> hi all
[01:41] <wasabi__> HuibertGill, well it won't install
[01:41] <aristoteles> hallo, how do i build a desktop with such panels as you find here: http://linuxtoy.org/img/sladf.jpeg
[01:41] <LookTJ> gnomefreak: Thanks
[01:41] <gnomefreak> vanberge: after he reboots than install l-r-m and nvidia-glx
[01:41] <luisito> gnomefreak: i mean for the performance, since it is a G3, you know...
[01:41] <HuibertGill> wasabi__: hmm, ok, can you gfive me a link where you downloadede the theme?
[01:41] <gnomefreak> vanberge: crap
[01:42] <wasabi__> HuibertGill, http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=48087
[01:42] <gnomefreak> vanberge: he needs to check his BusID its most likely wrong
[01:42] <aristoteles> i mean the upper panel looks like a composition of the upper and lower normal panels.
[01:42] <aristoteles> and the start bar or what it is, where can i find it?
[01:42] <aradia> vanberge: wierd thing x cant start itself automatically... i get the blue error screen. but i can get x to start using startx
[01:42] <Kesman> a bit more people here than on ircnet :p
[01:42] <wasabi__> HuibertGill,
[01:42] <wasabi__> HuibertGill, oh i see why
[01:43] <wasabi__> it's a zip file
[01:43] <vanberge> hmm...  wow that is wierd
[01:43] <gnomefreak> aradia: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
[01:43] <klotho> if you open a wireless network in the networks tool, is it supposed to show "not configured" if you aren't currently connected to a router?
[01:43] <wasabi__> HuibertGill, sorry for the confusion
[01:43] <vanberge> klotho, yes.
[01:44] <klotho> thanks vanberge ... that's kind of confusing
[01:44] <vanberge> klotho, that is initially how it is.
[01:44] <HuibertGill> wasabi__: I tried it, unpacking the zip files does not work either....
[01:44] <klotho> vanberge: the developers should put in a note since they know it's a wireless card. It should say "not configured or not currently connected"
[01:44] <wasabi__> HuibertGill, i tried a different one by the same guy and it works
[01:45] <vanberge> aradia, where are you at right now?
[01:45] <vanberge> klotho, i would agree.  i thought thtat it meant my card's drivers were not there
[01:45] <klotho> this wireless network card seemed to need an ifconfig eth0 up. shouldn't that happen by default?
[01:45] <aradia> vanberge: im in spm... shd i choose nvidia-settings too?
[01:45] <HuibertGill> wasabi__: hmm, still is strange
[01:45] <aradia> vanberge: or just nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel0common
[01:45] <wasabi__> yea
[01:45] <wasabi__> it is
[01:45] <aradia> vanberge: or just nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-common
[01:46] <jucacru> ol
[01:46] <vanberge> aradia, for now i would just do the glx and common and then linux restricted modules.  then reboot
[01:46] <jucacru> quieres quieres q1ue te la meta
[01:46] <gnomefreak> no
[01:46] <jucacru> porque
[01:46] <gnomefreak> !es | jucacru
[01:46] <ubotu> jucacru: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[01:46] <gnomefreak> aradia: dont install nvidia-settings :(
[01:46] <jucacru> bete a tu pueblo

[01:46] <jucacru> #
[01:47] <aradia> k
[01:47] <jucacru> ben a qui quete la meto
[01:47] <aradia> vanberge: do i choose linux restricted module 2.6.17-10-386 and linux-restricted-modules-common only?
[01:47] <aradia> vanberge: before i removed i saw a few others installed
[01:47] <jucacru> ol
[01:47] <aradia> vanberge: but i forgot which
[01:47] <vanberge> aradia, did you remove all of them?
[01:47] <jucacru> bete a tu pueblo
[01:48] <aradia> vanberge: i removed all linux-restricted-modules
[01:48] <aradia> vanberge: complete removal
[01:48] <vanberge> aradia, ok.. good

[01:49] <kanzie> I am experiencing problems suspending my Thinkpad T60 on Edgy, which worked fine on Dapper and have read some bug-reports, indicating this to be a problem in the kernel. The suggested solution is to revert back to kernel linux-image-2.6.15-23-686. How do that?
[01:49] <vanberge> check the one that says 2.6.17...  that should auto select common
[01:49] <vanberge> aradia,
[01:50] <aradia> vanberge: ok.. im getting them applied
[01:50] <vanberge> aradia, in the mean time... run this from terminal:  lspci
[01:50] <vanberge> aradia, and look for bus ID on your gfx card
[01:51] <gnomefreak> pastebin the output of lspci and open your /xorg.conf file

[01:54] <vanberge> gnomefreak, how would that happen?
[01:54] <gnomefreak> aradia: hold on ill get you the exact entry to make
[01:55] <aradia> gnomefreak: ok!
[01:55] <vanberge> aradia, did you get a chance to use beryl at all?

[02:06] <vanberge> nevron, the easiest way is from synaptic...
[02:06] <aradia> gnomefreak: i did start x andwow i think its working
[02:06] <slipttees> some use open Unichrome driver?
[02:06] <nevron> i forgot the console command to edit the sources list + i wat to delete my repos and set them to default
[02:06] <Erb> Where do I get the Totem codecs (error "You do not have a decoder installed to handle this file. You might need to install the necessary plugins."). I have all the gstreamer plugins.
[02:06] <digitalsatori> need help pls. the new added user account do not have the readline feature in the shell
[02:06] <gnomefreak> aradia: did you see nvidia screen?
[02:06] <nolimitsoya> clearscreen, always highlight, or youll go unnoticed in the chatter. just 'sudo apt-get install linx-headers-`uname -r`' to get the right headers
[02:06] <nevron> thanks gnomefreak
[02:06] <gnomefreak> aradia: did you change the driver to nvidia?
[02:07] <gnomefreak> slipttees: edgy?
[02:07] <vanberge> Erb, go to ubuntu site... go to 'wiki'... then search 'restricted modules'
[02:07] <slipttees> slipttees@ubuntu:~$ uname -r
[02:07] <slipttees> 2.6.19.1.2-686
[02:07] <nevron> ok vanberge it is complaining about some missing keys any suggestions
[02:07] <slipttees> gnomefreak: yep
[02:07] <clearscreen> nolimitsoya my headers re installed ;)
[02:07] <gnomefreak> slipttees: thats not an edgy kernel
[02:07] <vanberge> Erb, there it tells you how to enable those plugins
[02:07] <nolimitsoya> clearscreen, then why would you have any problem, when you say thats all you need? ;)
[02:07] <vanberge> nevron, do you have any third party repos?
[02:07] <slipttees> gnomefreak: edgy kernel no full work in my Ipc

[02:07] <slipttees> PCI-E no work!
[02:07] <slipttees> :(
[02:08] <clearscreen> nolimitsoya, well because it gives me errors when running m-a to install modules: http://members.lycos.nl/dumpdumpdump/mad.log
[02:08] <gnomefreak> slipttees: did you build the kernel or get it from another repo?
[02:08] <slipttees> but this kernel it' ok!
[02:08] <digitalsatori> I'm a newbie to the linux system. probably this is a very silly question. As a add a new user account and log in w/ that new user account in the terminal, all that readline feature has gone
[02:08] <aradia> gnomefreak: i changed to 'nvidia'. i get the nvidia logo i tihnk, and twinview is working. but my window decorations are gone, and my kibadock has icons with black backgrounds
[02:08] <ubek_> hi ;] 
[02:08] <gnomefreak> aradia: is beryl running?
[02:08] <Stormx2> digitalsatori: readline feature? And why are you logging in from command line?
[02:09] <Erb> OK, it has something to do with legal matters doesn't it?
[02:09] <ubek_> mayby someone here had problem wiht sound on  asus a6rp-ap002h laptop
[02:09] <vanberge> Erb, no.. but many repos have a public key that you need to install
[02:09] <nevron> what is a GTK warning and how do i fix this issue
[02:09] <gnomefreak> slipttees: did you build the kernel or install it from a feisty repo?
[02:09] <vanberge> Erb, are you tryin to install beryl ?
[02:09] <aradia> gnomefreak: beryl is running
[02:09] <slipttees> gnomefreak: edgy kernel no working: PCI-E and PCI VGA VIA/S3G Unicrhome
[02:09] <gnomefreak> nevron: when using gksudo?
[02:09] <aradia> gnomefreak: i reloaded beryl but its still the same
[02:09] <gnomefreak> aradia: change theme using emerald
[02:09] <nolimitsoya> clearscreen, first of all, what you are doing is building, and second, you should be running -generic and not -686, and third - doublecheck that you are using the right compiler and that the headers realy are installed for the running kernel
[02:09] <slipttees> gnomefreak: i copilde
[02:09] <slipttees> compiled :)
[02:09] <Erb> no, just trying to get Totem and Mplayer working
[02:10] <vanberge> Erb, select universe and multiverse repos
[02:10] <vanberge> those dont need extra keys

[02:18] <nevron> i just issued that command should i still go for dpkg

[02:22] <GreyGhost> ozfrog but i dont remember what Crystal Atari Browser is...
[02:22] <GreyGhost> *dont know rather
[02:22] <nevron> ok can i issue commands from a bash script so that i dont have to type all this stuff?
[02:22] <r3tex> ok so now I have Ubuntu installed, how do I become a hacker? *can't believe im running GNU/EMACS/LINUX!!! so excited*
[02:22] <frogzoo> !docs | r3tex
[02:22] <ubotu> r3tex: documentation is to be found at http://help.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com - General linux documentation: http://www.tldp.org - http://rute.2038bug.com
[02:22] <ozfrog> GreyGhost "was" the first EVER browser for the Atari computer
[02:23] <jrib> nevron: all this stuff?  It's usually one command for one thing you want to do.  People usually make aliases (there are some recommendations on the wiki page)
[02:23] <frogzoo> r3tex: also, tldp.org
[02:23] <reverseblade> r3tex, you can't be  a hacker
[02:23] <r3tex> reverseblade, :'( why ???
[02:23] <GreyGhost> ozfrog ,then i doubt whether i'm the guy u knew.....
[02:23] <sekhar> anyone familair with linux dc++ clients?

[02:23] <nevron> jrib i want a script to first purge and than get
[02:23] <r3tex> frogzoo, thanks :)
[02:23] <reverseblade> r3tex, no hacker have asked "how can I be a hacker" before
[02:23] <GreyGhost> oh well ..... u\time for me to get going... cya all...
[02:23] <cwillu> !dbus-viewer
[02:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dbus-viewer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:23] <r3tex> reverseblade, do you know many hackers?
[02:23] <sekhar> anyone familair with linux dc++ clients? please help
[02:23] <jrib> nevron: k, then you can write that if you want, but how often are you really going to be doing that?
[02:24] <reverseblade> r3tex, I know none of them asked this question.
[02:24] <clem> r3tex: you can apt-get source linux-image modify some commented lines and repackage the "hacked" kernel !!! oh my god, this is so exciting :)
[02:24] <nevron> assuming from my last installation of ubuntu i ll use it a lot
[02:24] <ozfrog> frogzoo  ?
[02:24] <sekhar> anyone familair with linux dc++ clients? please help
[02:24] <reverseblade> r3tex, because instead they spend their valuable times with digging the kernels protocols ,rather than asking to people to find an easy way. A hacker always goes from the harder way
[02:25] <r3tex> clem, sweet! what version of GCC does Ubuntu ship with? 4.2 is supposed to have support for dual core as a default march setting.

[02:25] <frogzoo> ozfrog: you'll make better progress tackling it one at a time - first place to look /var/log/messages & see what the kernel says out your hardware, also lspci
[02:25] <nevron> jrib i have been suffering from beryls partial installation and i did everythnig right still when i remove and install the pack i am getting the same errors
[02:25] <tomix> im trying to use simple backup to peform a backup to a server on the local network using ssh however when i test the connectionit comes back with a permissions error. This is despite the fact i can login using ssh via the terminal and do what i want
[02:25] <clem> r3tex: I was only kidding of course.. I tend to agree with reverseblade.

[02:25] <tomix> any ideas?
[02:25] <r3tex> reverseblade, kernel protocols? you mean apis?
[02:26] <ozfrog> frogzoo Thanx will look therein
[02:26] <cwillu> tomix: probably need to sudo
[02:26] <jrib> nevron: well a script to automate the process won't help :)  Pastebin your errors
[02:26] <nevron> dpkg --purge package beryl beryl-core beryl-plugins beryl-plugins-data beryl-settings beryl-manager emerald emerald-themes
[02:26] <reverseblade> r3tex, no TCP/IP
[02:26] <frogzoo> tomix: no write perm?
[02:26] <reverseblade> sekhar, I am not
[02:26] <nevron> now will that command work how is the syntax for that command
[02:27] <nevron> do i go sudo dpkg--purge beryl beryl-core beryl-plugins beryl-plugins-data beryl-settings beryl-manager emerald emerald-themes
[02:27] <tomix> yeah im guessing so since it says the backup cannot be 'written' there
[02:27] <r3tex> reverseblade, wow that's the kernel uses TCP/IP for messaging? haha I'm such a n00b and here I thought they had some efficient new vm in 2.6 ^_^ sorry...
[02:27] <stefg> nevron: apt-get remove --purge ...
[02:27] <jrib> nevron: use  aptitude purge blah
[02:27] <frogzoo> nevron: dpkg --purge  <space>
[02:27] <tomix> you mean sudo on my machine?
[02:27] <jrib> or that
[02:27] <tomix> why would the be if i dont need to in the terminal?
[02:27] <reverseblade> r3tex, I think you are fucking with me
[02:27] <dyggMerald> anyone know how i get rid of the "gnome behaviour" that causes a alt + right mousclick even inside a wine fullscreen application to bring up a menu ?
[02:27] <reverseblade> sorry for the bad lang
[02:27] <r3tex> reverseblade, i think so too
[02:27] <nevron> apt-get--purgeremove
[02:27] <nevron> maybe like this?
[02:28] <frogzoo> reverseblade: careful dude, the mods get stroppy with languagge
[02:28] <nevron> i put sudo in the begining of course
[02:28] <reverseblade> frogzoo, sorry my fault
[02:28] <cwillu> tomix: are you ssh'ing to the root account on the remote box?
[02:28] <jrib> nevron: sure that will work
[02:28] <tomix> no my personal account although it does have administrative priviliges
[02:29] <nevron> jrib can you tell me where i can find the default repositories?
[02:29] <ozfrog> frogzoo Is pasting punishable by castration here?
[02:29] <r3tex> Ubuntu has changed so many things. 6 years ago if somebody ran slackware or freebsd it said something about their skills. Now my grandma runs linux =/
[02:29] <nevron> default installation repos my repo list seems to be broken
[02:29] <cwillu> tomix, what's the command you're running to do the copy, vs the one that works in ssh?
[02:29] <frogzoo> ozfrog: afraid so

[02:29] <ubotu> nevron: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".

[02:30] <jrib> nevron: make a dapper one and change all the "dapper" to "edgy"
[02:30] <nevron> ok jrib thx
[02:30] <ozfrog> Grogzoo If I paste will you look? :)
[02:30] <r3tex> the names in Debian are from Toy Story, what are the ones in Ubuntu from?
[02:30] <ozfrog> Frogzoo If I paste will you look? :)
[02:30] <nevron> why didnt they include edgy is it because this distro is new?
[02:31] <frogzoo> ozfrog: yep

[02:31] <r3tex> dyggMerald, that was so annoying for me =/ i want Alt+ rightclick to resize the window. I could change it with Emereald though.

[02:32] <clem> r3tex: Feisty fawn I believe
[02:32] <r3tex> just joking ;)
[02:32] <clem> r3tex: potato was a Debian release.
[02:32] <digitalsatori> r3tex: I finally figure it out, the newly added account is using the sh shell in default, when I change it to bash, it is ok
[02:32] <cwillu> tomix: does a scp work?
[02:32] <ozfrog> frogzoo - seems all are seen except the sound card
[02:33] <r3tex> digitalsatori, hmm, maybe in ubuntu /bin/sh is linked to /bin/dash instead of /bin/bash
[02:33] <digitalsatori> t3text: how could I change the user account's default shell seting in command line
[02:33] <frogzoo> ozfrog: what's the sound card?
[02:33] <ozfrog> frogzoo BUT the video images are still crap :(
[02:33] <r3tex> digitalsatori, chsh
[02:33] <ozfrog> Creative SoundBlaster 16
[02:33] <dyggMerald> r3tex:  what is Emereald, i cant find it with apt-cache
[02:33] <frogzoo> digitalsatori: sudo vi /etc/passwd - careful how you go in there though
[02:33] <digitalsatori> r3tex: thank you very much
[02:33] <r3tex> dyggMerald, oh, it's a "part" of Beryl the cool 3d windowmanager thing
[02:33] <tomix> cwillu: im not sure i will give it ago
[02:34] <clem> dyggMerald: it's a theme manager for beryl.
[02:34] <r3tex> frogzoo, chsh, vipw and other commands are preferred over changing the file directly
[02:34] <frogzoo> r3tex: agreed ;)

[02:35] <frogzoo> ozfrog: it's virtually impossible that's not recognised, is it pci or isa ?

[02:36] <ozfrog> frogzoo PCI - I think Noah made it
[02:36] <tomix> cwillu: yes its fine
[02:37] <tomix> is it maybe something to do with acessing it using ssh://
[02:37] <c0ntrol> I have a problem with ATI radeon 9600 xt and Ubuntu Edgy. The fglrx driver failes with 'PreInitDAL' failed. Are there any solutions ?
[02:37] <ozfrog> r3tex "no file or dossier of this type"
[02:37] <r3tex> c0ntrol, have you googled for it?
[02:37] <c0ntrol> r3tex: Yes, this has bothered me for 30 hours straight
[02:38] <r3tex> ozfrog, you mean you don't have a /proc/asound/cards file?
[02:38] <ozfrog> r3tex it would appear so :(
[02:38] <ozfrog> r3tex or NOT appear so in this case
[02:38] <frogzoo> ozfrog: it may become necessary to pass irq/io params to the driver
[02:38] <tomix> cwillu?

[02:39] <QwertyM> makes sys hardened ?
[02:39] <ozfrog> r3tex still NO
[02:39] <r3tex> ozfrog, ok maybe you need to load the correct module
[02:39] <r3tex> although it _should_ autoload
[02:40] <ozfrog> frogzoo it may become necessary to pass irq/io params to the driver - you will have to hold my hand :)

[02:41] <rhkfin> ok.. Thanks!
[02:41] <QwertyM> same with freecontrib

[02:42] <r3tex> cwillu, don't you right-click in xp to set up the network?
[02:42] <ramon_> nolimitsoya:don't think so, where?
[02:42] <r3tex> then just choose ad-hoc

[02:43] <ramon_> nolimitsoya: thanks, will do
[02:43] <Invisible_> hi, can i configure ubuntu as a mail/nat server for my organization ?
[02:43] <tomix> http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbackup/
[02:43] <ozfrog> frogzoo maybe I don't have a Linux driver? If the card has not been recognised, or is it loaded as default
[02:43] <nolimitsoya> Invisible_, yes
[02:44] <cwillu> tomix: sbackup was the name I was looking for
[02:44] <frogzoo> ozfrog: try 'modprobe snd-sb16'
[02:44] <tomix> its the one that seems to come recommend to be used with ubuntu
[02:44] <ozfrog> frogzoo OK
[02:44] <c0ntrol> brb
[02:44] <nevron> ok how do i edit my sources list is there a console command to go with gedit
[02:44] <stefg> Invisible_: it can be done... but i can't tell if /you/ can do it :-)
[02:44] <cwillu> tomix: any way you can setup to use certs instead of a password like that?
[02:44] <nevron> plus will i replace all of the dapper words with edgy
[02:44] <mneptok> nevron: sudo nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:44] <tomix> are ok sorry i was confused by the fact its called simple backup
[02:45] <cwillu> heh
[02:45] <cwillu> np
[02:45] <nevron> mneptok why not gedit
[02:45] <tomix> quite possibly yes
[02:45] <mneptok> nevron: you asked about a terminal command
[02:45] <ozfrog> frogzoo whole list of errors, mainly concerning :lib/modules
[02:45] <tomix> gonna be a pain though
[02:45] <cwillu> gah, that's an ugly default they provide
[02:45] <nevron> ok i ll run from a terminal and execute gedit is it possible
[02:45] <ozfrog> frogzoo looks like /lib missing?
[02:45] <DjViper> sit0 interface. what is this?
[02:46] <Invisible_> nolimitsoya> And in mail i can also set rules as well rite? like u know blocking images, blocking diffrent file types
[02:46] <mneptok> nevron: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:46] <Invisible_> something like that
[02:46] <frogzoo> ozfrog: if your /lib is "missing"...
[02:46] <ozfrog> frogzoo Paste?
[02:46] <seravitae> hello there
[02:46] <frogzoo> ozfrog: best
[02:46] <r3tex> seravitae, hi!!
[02:46] <cwillu> tomix: k, trying it here right now
[02:46] <seravitae> hi r3tex :)
[02:47] <r3tex> seravitae, Ubuntu works great right?
[02:47] <nolimitsoya> Invisible_, should be possible. depends on what mailserver you choose.
[02:47] <cwillu> tomix: does it fail when you hit test, or later?
[02:47] <seravitae> absolutely
[02:47] <ozfrog> done
[02:47] <seravitae> only linux distribution i consider 'usable'
[02:47] <r3tex> seravitae, oh wow :) what's wrong with the others?
[02:47] <rapid> seravitae, ^^
[02:47] <cwillu> tomix: what's the path to the backup folder on the target?
[02:48] <seravitae> heh, nothings wrong with them, but at least for me, an average guy, ubuntu 'just works'
[02:48] <ozfrog> frogzoo or maybe I should have sudo'd 1st?
[02:48] <justin_> seraphim, ? "Only" ?
[02:48] <r3tex> sweet
[02:48] <seravitae> except the odd hiccup, which is why i hear :)
[02:48] <tomix> when i hit test
[02:48] <frogzoo> ozfrog: yes
[02:48] <justin_> Ubuntu is probably best for the noob :)
[02:48] <seravitae> why i'm here*
[02:48] <cwillu> tomix: and what's the path on the target you're using?
[02:48] <nolimitsoya> !server | Invisible_
[02:48] <ubotu> Invisible_: Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI.

[02:48] <r3tex> justin_, i made that mistake too when hitting Tab
[02:48] <tomix> /Volumes/BackUp/Desktops/myname
[02:48] <seravitae> i am trying to compile a webcam driver that some guys wrote for my particular chipset and i'm having the following difficulty: when running make, i get this error: make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-386/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.make: *** [default]  Error 2
[02:48] <seravitae> i'm wondering if i'm missing something.
[02:49] <seravitae> like build-tools?
[02:49] <r3tex> maybe you need the package buld-essential or something
[02:49] <cwillu> tomix: I wonder if they're doing something stupid like forcing it to lower case
[02:49] <rapid> seravitae, you haven't set the buildpath probably
[02:49] <justin_> r3tex, I make it all the time - and I have been using this chat for like 7 or so years haha
[02:49] <ozfrog> frogzoo =< module not found
[02:49] <seravitae> ok
[02:49] <cwillu> tomix: what's your home directory on the target?
[02:49] <seravitae> i have build-essential
[02:49] <tomix> hmmmm
[02:49] <nevron> jrib?
[02:49] <frogzoo> ozfrog: try 'modprobe snd-sb16'
[02:49] <tomix> thats a good point
[02:49] <cwillu> is it the standard /home/tomix/ bit?
[02:49] <seravitae> rapid - i'm not sure what the correct buildpath should be. is there a way to locate it?
[02:49] <r3tex> seraphim, a cool program you can use that helps you find files that apt should have is apt-file
[02:50] <rapid> seravitae, are there any docs with the driver?
[02:50] <tomix> /Groups/Beef/myname
[02:50] <cwillu> tomix, give that a shot
[02:50] <nevron> jrib lets say i have this deb-src http://tr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe multiverse will i change it into this deb-src http://tr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy universe multiverse
[02:50] <seravitae> rapid - unfortunately not, because it was a reverse-engerineered project.
[02:50] <tomix> have done already and it dont work
[02:50] <tomix> did work with scp though
[02:50] <jrib> nevron: yep
[02:50] <seravitae> I can however link you to the website which contains the driver, but i have scoured it for 'installation' documents with no luck
[02:50] <cwillu> tomix: okay,
[02:50] <cwillu> I have my theories :
[02:50] <tomix> i will try a different server without uppercase folder names
[02:50] <r3tex> seravitae, dude, read the error message
[02:50] <r3tex> :)
[02:50] <r3tex> hehe
[02:50] <nevron> ok i ll do it for all the source is there a find and replace in gedit
[02:51] <rapid> seravitae, check the makefile, and see what dir you have similar to the one i nthe error
[02:51] <r3tex> it says what the problem is
[02:51] <cwillu> tomix: another approach would be to sshfs the target, and then just copy it to the locally mounted directory
[02:51] <rapid> then modify and try remake
[02:51] <rapid> thats what I would do
[02:51] <cwillu> i.e., mount the target directory via sshfs to some folder on the local machine, and copy to that
[02:51] <tomix> thats not a bad idea guess i could get it to mount the drive at start up
[02:52] <ozfrog> frogzoo module not found
[02:52] <seravitae> rapid, yeah, there's no build dir in there.. or in any of the /lib/modules/ dirs
[02:52] <cwillu> tomix: a certificate approach would be your friend regardless;  I shudder thinking about how the password is going to be among the backups otherwise :)
[02:52] <Invisible_> if i want to create rules with my mail server which application i should go for? sendmail /postfix?
[02:52] <tomix> ok same problem on other server so it isnt uppercase problem
[02:52] <tomix> really
[02:53] <cwillu>  tomix, I'll set you up an account on my box temporarily, just to try it
[02:53] <tomix> how would it end up like that...scuse my ignorance
[02:53] <r3tex> seravitae, make a soft link to your build dir then
[02:53] <tomix> cheers
[02:53] <cwillu> tomix: might you have syntax in your password?
[02:53] <seravitae> r3tex:  i would if i knew where my build dir was
[02:53] <r3tex> seravitae, to your /usr/src/linux dir
[02:53] <nevron> jrib i have a major problem besides these small ones i have dual heads and the monitors are not identical

[03:09] <mattfletcher> Apologies if any terminology here is incorrect, this is a support request for a friend. He has a latek file which relies on a number of latek "styles?" to load. he has found a good number of these and it is still asking for more. is there a meta-package which he can apt-get which will install them all. he's starting to get pretty frustrated as his usual distro (scientific linux) has all these things installed by default
[03:09] <jordo23> Does Edgy have support for Audigy sound cards or do I have to configure anything specific?

[03:31] <stephan1> bye
[03:31] <un_operateur> !esd
[03:31] <ubotu> esd is the enlightened sound deamon. It's deprecated, use !alsa instead
[03:31] <rapid> picasso, man xorg.conf
[03:31] <mjs> nolimitsoya, ok sounds good. Hopefully I won't be back. =)
[03:31] <SgtCyrex> i've got a problem setting up the libapache2-mod-auth-mysql... i seriously havent the slightest idea what to do when i get error #2002 mysql socket error
[03:31] <bulmer> picasso: there should be like default  resolution and stuff...look around that area
[03:31] <Trixsey> [3B, why dont you answer in PM? :(
[03:31] <nolimitsoya> mjs, i think we all hope you will, but running ubuntu the next time ;)
[03:31] <picasso> right, there is
[03:32] <picasso> but it's all for my primary display
[03:32] <[3B> omg
[03:32] <[3B> Trixsey,  i have answered ya :S
[03:32] <[3B> didnt u read me ?
[03:32] <picasso> every place that talks about a resolution says 1600x1050, so i dont know why this other output is 800x600 (or similar)
[03:32] <Trixsey> no
[03:32] <mjs> nolimitsoya, I will, I was just trying to be funny, although it may be a little too early for that yet.
[03:32] <[3B> ouch
[03:32] <[3B> well
[03:32] <Trixsey> cant see your text
[03:32] <[3B> ok ill write here
[03:32] <[3B> Edit ur xorg.conf in all driver device set all to fglrx
[03:32] <[3B> after that
[03:32] <jrib> !support | mattfletcher
[03:32] <bulmer> picasso: umm am not aware that you can have different resolution for the back video port of a laptop as compared to the default display
[03:32] <ubotu> mattfletcher: For your support options, see http://www.ubuntu.com/support
[03:33] <[3B> edit ur /etc/module
[03:33] <mattfletcher> jrib: i know everyone is a volunteer - i am one myself. i don't see how that is relevant. the fact is that my friend has never made the leap (small though it may be) to get onto irc. i use gaim for talking to friends on the msn network, and i've never seen anything to suggest it could give me this room.
[03:33] <picasso> =\
[03:33] <[3B> and add a line with fglrx
[03:33] <[3B> and to finish write in console
[03:33] <[3B> sudo ln -s /usr/lib/dri /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/
[03:33] <[3B> okay?
[03:33] <Trixsey> wait.. so much info :O
[03:33] <Trixsey> first I'll fix xorg.con
[03:33] <jrib> mattfletcher: k
[03:34] <un_operateur> !moon-buggy-esd
[03:34] <ubotu> moon-buggy-esd: Drive some car across the moon (version with sound). In component universe, is extra. Version 1.0.51-1 (edgy), package size 132 kB, installed size 316 kB
[03:34] <Trixsey> wait
[03:34] <[3B> sure
[03:34] <Trixsey> [3B, my xorg.conf looks strange
[03:34] <rapid> mattfletcher, gaim is irc aswell
[03:34] <[3B> why ?
[03:34] <jrib> mattfletcher: I think the expecation is that system > help doucmentation will tell you how to get here
[03:34] <[3B> trixsey u got msn ?
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> mattfletcher, choosing irc for protocol instead of msn will give you chat in gaim
[03:35] <rapid> but thats too straight forward.
[03:36] <timhaughton> Anyone know how to make my system NOT hang if it can't find a non-critical device in fstab?
[03:36] <nolimitsoya> rapid, what is?
[03:36] <un_operateur> errm, MSN and IRC are two different protocols
[03:36] <[3B> Trixsey,  gimme ur msn in pm and ill add you
[03:36] <rapid> yes thats correct.
=== th1_ is now known as t0h
[03:36] <rapid> from within gaim you can connect to IRC aswell but
[03:36] <rapid> gaim is a program designed to connect to many different protocols
[03:37] <Trixsey> ok
[03:37] <Trixsey> josefnilsen@hotmail.com
[03:37] <[3B> any1 knows where kvirc get installed after apt-get ??? i dont find it :d
[03:37] <llindy> I have gaim, use it every day, it has yahoo, msn,icq, and jabber
[03:37] <rapid> [3B, find and locate should work.
[03:37] <renzo17> check /usr/bin
[03:37] <un_operateur> [38 -- at a terminal --  kvirc :)
[03:37] <rapid> llindy, and irc
[03:37] <llindy> yes
[03:37] <llindy> does
[03:37] <rapid> :)
[03:37] <[3B> i added ya
[03:37] <llindy> but here I use x-chat2
[03:38] <rapid> likewise
[03:38] <josh___> who has an integreated raid controller on their mobo?
[03:38] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | josh___
[03:38] <ubotu> josh___: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:39] <[3B> ok rapid
[03:39] <[3B> Trixsey,  i have added ya, i dont see you online
[03:39] <josh___> here we go with that !anyone stuff again.... look people... i understand everyone here is "!" happy but seriously, if no one has what i'm looking for it is really quite pointless to go into detail about my problem....
[03:39] <Toma-> Whats the option to get ffmpeg to record a mic input aswell as a composite video input? Ive got the video input down pat, but my audio isnt recording
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> josh___, youre wasting peoples time getting replys that isnt helping either. ju ask, please
[03:40] <mattfletcher> what a ball ache that sounds. wouldn't a very simple irc client that only logged into this room be useful on the help menu?
[03:40] <pike_> josh___: you like your charter comm service? ive been thinking about switching to them
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> mattfletcher, yes it would. file a bugreport :)
[03:41] <jrib> mattfletcher: I think removing xchat was the wrong decision as well
[03:41] <un_operateur> its not a bug lol
[03:41] <josh___> ok, on the intel 965 board (or any other board that has integrated raid controller, how do i bypass the raid controller enough so that i can install something other then windows on my box?
[03:41] <nolimitsoya> un_operateur, yes it is
[03:41] <josh___> pike_: who do you have now?
[03:41] <rapid> josh___, i'd look in the bios to start with
[03:41] <nolimitsoya> un_operateur, please understand that any undesired behaviour - or lack of disired behaviour - is a bug
[03:41] <un_operateur> iirc -- server irc.ubuntu.com -- /join #ubuntu   -- how hard can that be?
[03:41] <nolimitsoya> *desired
[03:41] <pike_> josh___: at home .. windstream dsl.
[03:42] <pike_> josh___: im moving
[03:42] <jrib> mattfletcher: we should take this to -offtopic now though
[03:42] <[3B> ffs
[03:42] <[3B> i cant send you text?
[03:42] <mattfletcher> nolimitsoya: i have very vague recollections of such a conversation. don't recall where it was held though. i think it could have been launchpad
[03:42] <pike_> probably offtopic sorry guys
[03:42] <[3B> Trixsey,  add me again
[03:42] <naylor> hi having real problems on my system, think a powercut corrupted some files. got it fscked and system works but stuff like bittorrent not working and add/remove menu and all sorts of stuff. i've put my errors here if anyone could please take look for me thanks: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1903902#post1903902
[03:42] <un_operateur> nolimitsoya, the lack of functionality does not constitute a bug -- its simply an incapability -- a bug is a glitch in functionality
[03:42] <nolimitsoya> mattfletcher, then a search might be in order before filing the bug. anyhow, if you come up with a good idea like this, a bug should be filed
[03:42] <Trixsey> you arent on my MSN now?
[03:42] <Trixsey> w00t
[03:42] <[3B> my msn is fucked up
[03:43] <[3B> gimme a sec
[03:43] <[3B> ill install amsn instead
[03:43] <[3B> :D
[03:43] <wijnand> when i close adobe reader, it forgets my printer settings (i.e. that i use A4 paper)... is there any way I can make it remember that?
[03:43] <[3B> this shit
[03:43] <nolimitsoya> un_operateur, im not going to argue this. read up on lauchpad
[03:43] <josh___> i looked in the bios
[03:43] <un_operateur> nolimitsoya, i'm dont want to argue this either and no im not going to read anything -- i know what a bug is
[03:43] <[3B> Trixsey,  ill be online in 1 minuto
[03:44] <mattfletcher> un_operateur: have a look at bug 1
[03:44] <barata> !dejavu

[03:44] <frogzoo> naylor: 'sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade'
[03:44] <mattfletcher> un_operateur: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1 you are wrong
[03:45] <cosm0z`> anyone know why Open Office is so dang unstable in Ubuntu?
[03:45] <cosm0z`> as soon as i open a document it crashes
[03:45] <un_operateur> bug #1 - Microsoft has a majority market share ??
[03:45] <frogzoo> cosm0z`: edgy?
[03:45] <cosm0z`> dapper
[03:46] <josh___> my problem is this, the hard drive and the cd-rom are installed to the ide slot on the motherboard, which stupidly enough, is controlled by a sata raid device (i don't know why they did that either but what the hell...). Windows installed just fine, it's any flavor of linux that seems to have an issue
[03:46] <naylor> frogzoo, ran that through just now but it's not added, reinstalled or removed anything
[03:46] <cosm0z`> prob so un_operateur
[03:46] <frogzoo> cosm0z`: edgy has 2.04 - but if you're on stock oo for dapper, you need to upgrade
[03:46] <frogzoo> !oo
[03:46] <frogzoo> !ooo
[03:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about oo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[03:46] <frogzoo> meh
[03:46] <barata> meh?
[03:46] <cosm0z`> k, thx frogzoo .... ill take a l00k
[03:46] <barata> apt-get install meh?
[03:47] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, are you looking for help on OO.org by any chance?
[03:47] <frogzoo> cosm0z`: there's a test repo with 2.0 for dapper or used to be
[03:47] <nolimitsoya> !openoffice > frogzoo
[03:47] <josh___> with ubuntu, it wont even attempt to load most of the time, or when it does it will hang on mounting root filesystem. gentoo, loads me up to a "dos" prompt and dies from there. suse, refuses to even load off the cd
[03:47] <[3B> Trixsey,  mty fucking msn is fucked up, sorry for this long wait
[03:47] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, please read the pm from ubotu

[03:47] <ubotu> Gartral: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:47] <frogzoo> nolimitsoya: you don't perchance have the url for dapper oo 2.0 ?
[03:48] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, is it in backports?
[03:48] <josh___> pike_: its ok... but it depends on where you are moving too
[03:48] <frogzoo> nolimitsoya: more than likely - there you go cosm0z`
[03:48] <josh___> pike_: you might end up with comcast which supposedly has beeter speeds/services
[03:48] <cosm0z`> k, thx frogzoo
[03:49] <frogzoo> why isn't aero the default theme? think I'll file a bug
[03:49] <josh___> for all my cable channels, on demand channels, 4 digital recievers, a dvr, and 10 meg internet... it costs me just under $200 a month
[03:49] <Gartral> ok ok, well, i have a slight configuration problem... my apps, Places, and System got put on the wrong side of the launch buttons.. any clues as to how to fix it?
[03:50] <bulmer> whoa 200 buckaroos, too expensive for me
[03:50] <josh___> drag it to the other side?
[03:50] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, aero as in aeroglass? in that case, its becouse aeroglass is a windows wm. or are you having a laugh? :)
[03:50] <stefg> josh___: I'd consider bypassing the whole mess by buying an external hd to put ubuntu on.. the problem might be, that your sata-controller seems not very well supported, so it might be easier to circumvent that for a while
[03:50] <naylor> if anyone can please help it would be awesome, i've got holes in things i can't run and don't know what to reinstall etc
[03:50] <josh___> lol my electric bill is just over 300 bulmer
[03:51] <josh___> stefg: yeah but the problem is... i cant seem to get anything but windows to boot from cd
[03:51] <bulmer> josh___: and you live alone or run an ISP in your basement? hehehe
[03:51] <josh___> so external or internal, it wont matter...
[03:51] <josh___> bulmer: 2 kids, wife, and ISP in the basement :P
[03:51] <nolimitsoya> josh___, did you check the cd? try disabling hdd boot as an interim
[03:51] <bulmer> lolz
[03:52] <naylor> here's the errors in terminal when i try run bittorrent
[03:52] <naylor> http://pastebin.ca/284994
[03:52] <DanaG> hmm, I don't like the current usplash theme.
[03:52] <josh___> nolimitsoya: yep, i have disabled the hdd boot and then it just hangs. i have changed the raid controller to raid mode, ide mode, and disabled but get the same result (with the exception of disabled which just completely ignores all my devices)
[03:53] <DanaG> DOes anyone here have fbsplash set up?  I made my own fbsplash theme based off the GDM theme.
[03:53] <ken> I need the open source editor called "jedit" in ubuntu. BUt when i type the name in add/remove, no program shows up. Can someone please help?
[03:53] <nevron> nolimitsoya thank you for your suggestions
[03:53] <stefg> josh___: Hmmm, your system obviously would need a special kernel. It's prolly possible to build one /after/ installation (tho it's no trivial task). The problem is finding an initial kernel (or special boot-parameters) to get it installed... chicken/egg problem
[03:53] <Gartral> try in synaptic
[03:53] <nolimitsoya> nevron, i dont remeber what they where, but you are welcome :)
[03:54] <nevron> it was about nvidia graphics cards :D
[03:54] <DanaG> I already have mine set up.
[03:54] <nolimitsoya> stefg, im not sure thats his problem. this seems to be a bootqueue issue, and not linuxrelated in the least
[03:54] <nolimitsoya> nevron, then i remember. :) hope one of them suited you :)
[03:55] <nevron> yes i ll buy one of them do they have any problems with ubuntu though?
[03:55] <Gartral> i have found the best use for a USB port, a USB foot massager
[03:56] <nolimitsoya> nevron, not more than any other card with proprietary drivers :)
[03:57] <frogzoo> Gartral: feet are now USB?
[03:57] <schlonzo> hello i want to have such a mac-like taskbar... but how to install it?
[03:58] <Gartral> no, just a usb foot massage pad
[03:58] <nevron> :)

[03:59] <frogzoo> schlonzo: look for aluminiumalloysmog - that's quite mac like
[03:59] <frogzoo> schlonzo: oh... the taskbar...
[04:00] <Gartral> so any way, does anyone have a solution to my prob?
[04:00] <nolimitsoya> schlonzo, ive seem one for xfce on the dreamlinux live cd. find out what its called, and you might find a way to install and run it in ubuntu
[04:00] <naylor> any help would be really appreciated guys, i can't run certain programs cos i get errors such as: http://pastebin.ca/284994
[04:01] <nolimitsoya> Gartral, which is? if you dont get any replys your question hasnt been noticed. wait a while, and ask again
[04:01] <Gartral> ok,
[04:01] <Gartral> i have a slight configuration problem... my apps, Places, and System got put on the wrong side of the launch buttons.. any clues as to how to fix it?
[04:01] <Gartral> System menus *
[04:02] <nolimitsoya> Gartral, couldnt you just rightclick them and choose 'move'? i havnt used gnome in a long time...
[04:02] <Gartral> no... thats a KDE function
[04:02] <Invisible_> does postfix has webinterface?
[04:02] <nolimitsoya> Gartral, and xfce, mind you ;)
[04:03] <schlonzo> thank you guys
[04:03] <Gartral> i used X once, i didnt like it
[04:03] <minnmass> I am having problems with apt-get; it fails on "apt-get upgrade".  "unable to make backup link of `./bin/ls' before installing new version: Operation not permitted" (coreutils package)  Any suggestions on where to start?
[04:03] <Gartral> im THAT much of a control freak
[04:03] <un_operateur> Gartral, are you on gnome or KDE now?
[04:03] <Gartral> gnome

[04:05] <Kesman> hey, does anybody know why my cpu usage jumps to 100% immediately when I run any 3d application?
[04:05] <runes> what's the recommended server to allow users to connect remotely and login to the gnome desktop?
[04:05] <Kesman> with fglrx
[04:05] <ScottK> Invisible_ - Postfix does not have a web interface.
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[04:06] <Gartral> copy that directly to the terminal?
[04:06] <nolimitsoya> Kesman, id say you probably arent running fglrx at all, but mesa :)
[04:06] <iturk> hi there !! is it ok to remove the /lib/modules/ of the kernels that we have deleted from bootsection ??
[04:06] <un_operateur> Gartral, yep
[04:06] <Invisible_> ScottK> like squiralmail ? so that users can open it using internet explorer?
[04:06] <pike_> runes: on a lan or over internet?
[04:06] <Kesman> nolimitsoya: no way, fglrxinfo gives me correct info and so does glxinfo
[04:06] <Gartral> tym, brb
[04:06] <un_operateur> Gartral, and you probably need a reboot after that
[04:06] <runes> pike_, over the internet
[04:06] <un_operateur> Gartral, or logoff/logon
[04:06] <Rikkimaru> How can I figure out when a file was made? (ls doesn't give me AM or PM)
[04:06] <runes> pike_, all the users are running winxppro
[04:07] <pike_> runes: hands down i like freenx the best. its just snappy when others like regular vnc are unusable
[04:07] <minnmass> Rikkimaru: what does it say?
[04:07] <nolimitsoya> Rikkimaru, then its probably 24h format
[04:07] <Rikkimaru> minnmass: Dec 12 12:51
[04:07] <ScottK> Invisible_ - I believe that Squirrelmail has it's own SMTP engine built in.
[04:08] <Rikkimaru> nolimitsoya: ah, you are correct.  I hadn't seen one of the log files that was over 12:00 :(.
[04:08] <ScottK> What problem are you trying to solve?

[04:13] <naylor> un_operateur, yeah amongst other stuff that won't work
[04:13] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> clem ,i just asked cos i'm new to lin and wasnt sure if warnings cause any harm ....

[04:15] <ken> People, i need some help finding the program "jedit", i cant find it in synaptic/add-remove, where should i get it?

[04:15] <Jussi01> My su password doesnt work... anyone know how to fix this?
[04:16] <ken> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: yes
[04:16] <un_operateur> naylor,   at a terminal -- sudo aptitude install -f
[04:16] <clem> Jussi01: what are you trying to do ?
[04:16] <felixfoertsch> Good afternoon - which drivers do I need for an Intel Onboard Graphicscard?
[04:16] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ken ,u managed it?
[04:16] <ken> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: And i was horribly unsuccessful at that
[04:16] <un_operateur> Jussi01, su doesnt work on ubuntu -- use sudo instead
[04:16] <clem> felixfoertsch: most likely i810
[04:16] <nolimitsoya> !passwd | Jussi01
[04:16] <ubotu> passwd: change and administer password and group data. In component main, is required. Version 1:4.0.16-2ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 733 kB, installed size 2316 kB
[04:16] <un_operateur> !sudo | Jussi01
[04:16] <ubotu> Jussi01: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:16] <felixfoertsch> clem: Are those in the repositories?
[04:17] <Gartral> Ken, apt-get install <program name>
[04:17] <un_operateur> !jedit
[04:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about jedit - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:17] <clem> un_operateur: su does work.... it's just that root has a weird password that's all :)
[04:17] <naylor> un_operateur, http://pastebin.ca/285014
[04:17] <Jussi01> ok...how do i get to root then?
[04:17] <ken> Gartral: Can i install a program through apt-get even if i cant find it in synaptic?
[04:17] <clem> felixfoertsch: installed by default
[04:17] <Gartral> sometimes
[04:17] <nolimitsoya> Jussi01, you dont. use sudo
[04:17] <un_operateur> clem, on ubntu -- root login is disabled -- there is no password :)
[04:17] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ken ,heres what i suuggest (never tried it myself though)  http://ktoon.toonka.com/documentation/index.php?title=Compiling_KToon_using_QT4
[04:17] <clem> un_operateur: there is, it's a random one.
[04:17] <Gartral> you know how to get apt-get to work right?
[04:18] <nolimitsoya> un_operateur, yes there is. its set random on install
[04:18] <minnmass> Jussi01: in terminal, use "sudo <command>" to run <command> as root.
[04:18] <ken> Gartral: I will not say that
[04:18] <naylor> un_operateur, what do i do now?
[04:18] <felixfoertsch> clem: So the hardware 3D acceleration should work?
[04:18] <clem> felixfoertsch: yes
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> there is no root password
[04:18] <felixfoertsch> clem: Thanks!
[04:18] <clem> felixfoertsch: glxinfo | grep rendering
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> look at /etc/shadow, if you have a password set for root, something is wrong
[04:19] <Jussi01> minnmass: yeah tried that - i get this message The '/home/jussi' directory does not belong to you.
[04:19] <Jussi01> Point $HOME to your home directory and try again.
[04:19] <ken> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: worth a try, but looking at my level of incompetence with linux, theres not much hope left, it simply leaves me more frustrated than ever, when i cant achieve a task in Linux. And i came to linux for peace of mind. What contradiction!
[04:19] <un_operateur> naylor, all i can think of is -- remove and reinstall that application
[04:19] <mjs> nolimitsoya: there seems to be a problem with the burning process.... after burning the disk, and then checking the properties.... it is as if the disk was never burned.
[04:19] <naylor> un_operateur, tried that, i've reinstalled all sorts of stuff but got errors all over the shop
[04:19] <nolimitsoya> mjs, try another burning app
[04:19] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ken ,i suppose that happens ion the beginning ... ( i'm a newbie too...)
[04:19] <mjs> nolimitsoya: That is what I am downloading as we speak.
[04:20] <ken> So finally how would i get "jedit" in Ubuntu?
[04:20] <clem> ken: what's jedit ?
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> jedit is java, just go download it
[04:20] <frogzoo> ken: no jedit, but gedit yes
[04:20] <naylor> un_operateur, this is what i get when try to run add/remove: http://pastebin.ca/285017
[04:20] <clem> ken: do you mean gedit ?
[04:20] <Gartral> ken, go into terminal, type "sudo su" it will ask for your password, just type it in, it wont show, but its there, after that type "apt-get install jedit"
[04:20] <un_operateur> naylor, it looks like the python libraries need updating
[04:21] <ken> Gartral: "E: Couldn't find package jedit
[04:21] <ken> "
[04:21] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> clem ,there exists a jedit too ....
[04:21] <clem> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: ok
[04:21] <Gartral> right, try "gedit"
[04:21] <frogzoo> ken: also 'jed'
[04:21] <ken> clem: frogzoo: Thats a open source editor written in Java, especially useful for programmers
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> Gartral, that shouldnt be recommanded to anyone who is not fully onboard the risks of running as su
[04:21] <frogzoo> ken: also 'xjed'
[04:21] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ken ,i dont believe jedit exists in  ubuntu repos
[04:21] <ken> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: It doesn't :(
[04:22] <nolimitsoya> !jedit
[04:22] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ken ,give me a minute and i'll try to figure jedit for u ...
[04:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about jedit - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:22] <naylor> un_operateur, how do i find out what needs reinstalling, tried various python stuff in synaptics but to no avail
[04:22] <ken> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: You have all the time in the world at your disposal :)
[04:22] <ken> Whats the next best bet to get a package i want to install if it isn't in ubuntu's repos and is fairly popular?
[04:22] <nolimitsoya> ken, find a deb
[04:23] <un_operateur> naylor, from the look of it -- it is the python_dbus bindings -- at a terminal -- sudo aptitude install python2.4-dbus python-dbus
[04:23] <sunnz2> ANyone know how orca works?
[04:23] <clem> ken: there's a debian package here http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download
[04:23] <ken> nolimitsoya: Is there some popular place where i cant get/find all .debs?
[04:23] <sunnz2> I have installed it.
=== imago is now known as imago2003
[04:23] <minnmass> I need help with apt-get; "apt-get upgrade" ... doesn't.
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> ken, not that i know of...
[04:23] <un_operateur> naylor, wait , this first -- sudo aptitude remove python2.4-dbus python-dbus
[04:23] <[3B> this is so weird i did install kvirc via apt-get but i dont find where kvirc got installed any1 could help me ?
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, have you tried the dist-upgrade?
[04:24] <nolimitsoya> [3B, just type kvirc in a terminal
[04:24] <un_operateur> [38 -- at a terminal -- sudo updatedb; locate kvirc
[04:24] <MarcN> [3B: what does apt-get say?
[04:24] <minnmass> nolimitsoya: yes
[04:24] <[3B> marcn its all done
[04:24] <[3B> the installacion was finished
[04:24] <[3B> al right
[04:24] <minnmass> "unable to make backup link of `./bin/ls' before installing new version: Operation not permitted"
[04:24] <[3B> but i dont find kfic
[04:24] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, whats the complaint then? from apt, that is... have you tried aptitude?
[04:24] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, ok, is the disk full?
[04:24] <[3B> nolimitsoya,  thanks YA! :D
[04:25] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ken ,get the deb off here ... and install http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=588&package_id=48232
[04:25] <dromer> !ipkg
[04:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ipkg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:25] <minnmass> no; 4.5G free.
[04:25] <nolimitsoya> [3B, you can launch it by pressing alt+f2 and typing as well. that way you dont have to have the terminal open. you can also create a launcher to just double click
[04:26] <naylor> un_operateur, hi that's definately fixed my add/remove but not bittorrent! but thanks good start
[04:27] <SgtCyrex> how do i copy everything in a folder (including subfolders) to another directory?
[04:27] <ken> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, clem, i got the .deb. Now how do we install that thing?
[04:27] <clem> ken: double click on it
[04:27] <clem> ken: or in a terminal "sudo dpkg -i thefile.deb"
[04:27] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ken , use "sudo dpkg -i name.deb
[04:27] <minnmass> SgtCyrex: terminal?  If so, "cp -r <source> <destination>
[04:28] <curs0r>  so...kiba-dock is just a launcher eh?
[04:28] <un_operateur> naylor, can you give me the errors bittorrent are giving you now ?

[04:29] <Gartral> un, try iming me again
[04:29] <ski-worklap> arggggggggg
[04:29] <ken> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: There not much hope in that logic, unless you believe in direct accountability of God to your good deeds. Anyways thanks :)
[04:29] <ski-worklap> these weird java crashes are starting to piss me off

[04:30] <SgtCyrex> minnmass: yeah, but lets say /home/user/Desktop/music/(all them files and directories) to /home/user/audio/...
[04:30] <curs0r> ski-worklap, use bittornado, not as convenient but better for your sanity
[04:30] <ski-worklap> curs0r, my tracker forbids it :(
[04:30] <Gartral> daminit, brb, im not using gain for irc anymore
[04:30] <ken> ski-worklap: i recommend ktorrent
[04:30] <ken> gartral: whats wrong with gaim?
[04:31] <un_operateur> naylor, can you type this command and give me its output --  dpkg -S `which gnome-btdownload`
[04:31] <minnmass> SgtCreyx "cp -r /home/user/Desktop/music /home/user/audio/"
[04:31] <Blake11> what is the xgl channel?
[04:31] <SeamusLP> Gartral: Use irssi, its a good command line client
[04:31] <ski-worklap> mc44, what'd i say? piss?
[04:31] <SeamusLP> oh, he left
[04:31] <mc44> ski-worklap: well repeating it isnt going to help :p
[04:31] <ski-worklap> sorry
[04:31] <ski-worklap> just wanted to verify the language filter is that low
[04:31] <kanzie> I just updated my JRE to using SUNs on my Edgy and now Azureus wont start no more...
[04:31] <gnomefreak> Blake11: #ubuntu-xgl
[04:31] <mc44> ski-worklap: theres no need to swear :)
[04:32] <naylor> un_operateur, http://pastebin.ca/285024
[04:32] <ski-worklap> Kanafani, what were you running before that?
[04:32] <Blake11> thanks
[04:32] <ski-worklap> err kanzie what were yiou running before? i have the same problem
[04:33] <kanzie> the one that comes with edgy, think it is the GNU version
[04:33] <ken> Is there some place where we have a HUGE list of .debs, from where we can get a package if its not in ubuntu's repos. Something like Download.com for deb-based distributions...or whatever?
[04:33] <kanzie> trying to reinstall azureus now
[04:33] <ski-worklap> Kanzie, oh azureus can run with gcj? interesting
[04:33] <ken> kanzie: Can you do a favour for your PC (do we call it that here?) and not use that resource hog?
[04:33] <kanzie> not to well though
[04:34] <SeamusLP> ken: sometimes the software devs will release debs, and sometimes people will put debs on the forums, but I don't know of any large collection outside of the repositories
[04:34] <kanzie> ken, sorry dude, dont really have any performance-issues with when running SUNs JRE... however on Windows I wouldnt touch it for the world
[04:34] <SeamusLP> ken: you can also use alien to convert rpm to deb
[04:34] <ken> SeamusLP: Thats sad. Than tell me, what do you do to get a package not in ubuntu.
[04:35] <kanzie> ken, also, there are hardly any good alternatives on Linux since uTorrent doe snot exist
[04:35] <ski-worklap> ken - do you have multiverse and universe, for starters?
[04:35] <clem> ken: I usually look in Debian's repo :)
[04:35] <ken> kanzie: Are you castisaging Sun? <frowns>
[04:35] <raghu206> is there any software that can open files with chm format
[04:35] <ken> ski-worklap: Yes, sir!
[04:35] <kanzie> shit... keeps on dying
[04:35] <SeamusLP> ken you either 1) find a deb 2) convert from rpm or 3) compile from source
[04:35] <un_operateur> naylor,  sudo aptitude install gconf2 bittorrent python-gtk2 python-gnome2 python-glade2 python-gnomecanvas
[04:35] <ken> kanzie: A ex-utorrent user like me, should use ktorrent.
[04:35] <naylor> un_operateur, hey just reinstalled everything in synaptics that had python in front of it and now bittorrent is working
[04:36] <un_operateur> naylor, ha ha -- ok :)
[04:36] <Thor> clear
[04:36] <ski-worklap> you got the seveas repos too?
[04:36] <ken> kanzie: Did you try utorrent's web interface?
[04:36] <kanzie> ken, neh... not on gnome
[04:36] <ken> clem: ok
[04:36] <ski-worklap> what about canonical and plf, those are handy too (when they work)
[04:36] <naylor> un_operateur, but few things still not right
[04:36] <kanzie> ken, web interface... nope, never heard of it
[04:36] <ski-worklap> !seveas

[04:37] <ken> kanzie: When will people accpet the fact that GNOME/KDE are innocent siblings, and the programs run with no ill-feelings in either environment?
[04:37] <nolimitsoya> Trixsey, edit your xorg.conf to use fglrx
[04:37] <Trixsey> done it
[04:37] <ken> kanzie: There exists a web-interface for utorrent, go check it out
[04:37] <un_operateur> ken, you still looking for jedit??
[04:37] <Trixsey> I been searching for like 10 hours
[04:37] <Trixsey> so I tried most tutorials
[04:37] <Trixsey> and stuff :P
[04:37] <ski-worklap> Trixsey, did you disable compositing?
[04:37] <ken> un_operateur: Thank you for your consideration, but the fine fellows here, told me how to do it. And now its working
[04:38] <un_operateur> ken, coolies :)
[04:38] <ken> :)
[04:38] <naylor> un_operateur, automatix was working before the powercut but now i get this when trying to start it up: http://pastebin.ca/285031
[04:38] <ski-worklap> Trixsey, Section "Extensions"  \n  Option "Composite" "false"  \n  EndSection
[04:38] <jatt> !automatix
[04:38] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[04:38] <ski-worklap> that worked for me (tm)
[04:38] <jatt> naylor: don't use automatix
[04:38] <Thor> test
[04:38] <Stormx2> Agreed.
[04:38] <ski-worklap> there's also easyubuntu
[04:38] <ski-worklap> !WorksForMe
[04:38] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[04:39] <kanzie> ken, do you have a link?
[04:39] <ski-worklap> Uboto, does that mean i should go back to debian stable?? ;)
[04:39] <ken> When i click a link that you people provide me, in xchat. Nothing happens, but when i right-click>open in browser, the originial Mozilla browser opens with it (NOT firefox). What to do?
[04:39] <ken> kanzie: let me find it
[04:39] <SeamusLP> Whats wrong with automatix?  I've used it since dapper without problems.
[04:39] <Stormx2> ski-worklap: You're talking to a bot
[04:39] <Stormx2> SeamusLP: breaks systems
[04:39] <ski-worklap> Stormx2, i know :)
[04:39] <nolimitsoya> ski-worklap, yes, you should if stability it toppriority
[04:39] <apokryphos> SeamusLP: we've seen many broken systems which automatix was the result
[04:39] <kanzie> ken, it seems it needs to run a .exe still...
[04:40] <ski-worklap> it's more interesting than talking to myself
[04:40] <SeamusLP> how exactly does it break systems?
[04:40] <Trixsey> ski-worklap, tried it
[04:40] <Trixsey> like I said
[04:40] <Trixsey> been going for 10 hours
[04:40] <SeamusLP> all it does is add some repositories and download software
[04:40] <kanzie> ken, so basically not for me...
=== GuL is now known as lokoo
[04:40] <un_operateur> naylor, that one is because the URL http://www.getautomatix.com/keys/sos.key is no longer available
[04:40] <Stormx2> SeamusLP: Forcing yes, not creating proper backups... etc. Seriously, take my word for it.
[04:40] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, by passing uncontrolled scripts and breaking the rules for packaging
[04:41] <Stormx2> SeamusL: Basically its really badly scripted and wouldn't be counted as "safe"
[04:41] <naylor> un_operateur, awesome thanks a lot for your help, you're the man
[04:41] <naylor> thanks see ya
[04:41] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, it also disables repo key checking, which is dangerous at best
[04:41] <ken> kanzie: you are right!
[04:41] <SeamusLP> What alternatives are there to automatix, then?
[04:41] <Stormx2> SeamusLP: yes
[04:41] <nolimitsoya> !easyubuntu | SeamusLP
[04:41] <ubotu> SeamusLP: easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[04:42] <kanzie> shit... something is rotten in my Java-install... I think Im leaving Edgy now
[04:42] <ken> kanzie: May i ask the reason for your reluctance to use ktorrent?
[04:42] <kanzie> back to Dapper
[04:42] <kanzie> ken, none whatsoever
[04:42] <kanzie> trying it now
[04:42] <ken> kanzie: than whats stopping you
[04:42] <Stormx2> kanzie: Java is screwed for you?
[04:42] <un_operateur> kanzie, where did you install java from -- the repos or sun's site?
[04:42] <kanzie> un_operateur, repos
[04:42] <malt1> anyone know of any free smtp mail services, i need it to send mail with phpbb....
[04:43] <kanzie> Stormx2, yes... I try to start Azureus and it core-dumps on me
[04:43] <un_operateur> kanzie, are other java applications working well??
[04:43] <kanzie> with reference to Java bugreport-site
[04:43] <PriceChild> !language | kanzie
[04:43] <ubotu> kanzie: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[04:43] <kanzie> PriceChild, what did I say that was offensive?
[04:43] <kanzie> I dont curse so this is kind of puzzling for me
[04:43] <un_operateur> the 4 letter s word :)
[04:44] <kanzie> what? where...
[04:44] <kanzie> "core"?
[04:44] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2006-June/080667.html <- check this out for a discussion between devs and the automatix dev
[04:44] <un_operateur> kanzie, s word dude :p
[04:44] <SeamusLP> nolimitsoya: cool, I'll check it out
[04:44] <Stormx2> kanzie: Got the latest version? Seen !java ?
[04:44] <kanzie> oh...
[04:44] <PriceChild> kanzie, have you chosen your default java version?
[04:45] <kanzie> PriceChild, yes...
[04:45] <SeamusLP> and for now I'll recommend easyubuntu over automatix, it seems to be just as functional
[04:45] <kanzie> PriceChild, by editing the /etc/jvm filke?
[04:45] <ken> Thank you people, Long live ubuntu!
[04:45] <kanzie> PriceChild, is there any other way?
[04:45] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, no it isnt. its much more functional, since it doesnt break your system ;)
[04:46] <Wanderer> hmm, the source-o-matic is completely dropped now it seems :<
=== Pricey is now known as PriceChild
=== sonium__ is now known as sonium
[04:47] <SeamusLP> nolimitsoya well I meant as far as features go ;)
[04:47] <leobloom> hallo everybody!
[04:47] <Gartra1> im back
[04:47] <PriceChild> !hi > leobloom
[04:47] <kanzie> PriceChild, so... any ideas?
[04:47] <SeamusLP> nolimitsoya: is it feasible to reverse the changes made by automatix?
[04:47] <PriceChild> kanzie, have you chosen your default java verson?
[04:48] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, no
[04:48] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, well, i guess you could do it manualy, but thats not very practical... itll be easier to just reinstall ubuntu
[04:49] <kanzie> PriceChild, by editing the /etc/jvm-file yes, I changed Sun-1.5.0 to top oif the list, is there anything else Im expected to do?
[04:49] <atIantis> Is there a tutuorial anywhere to install Azureues on Edgy? I see that many people are having the same problem as I am, but havent gotten any working solutions.  (sudo apt-get install azureues does not work)
[04:49] <minnmass> I've seen a couple of suggestions to reinstall ubuntu.  Is it possible to do this without losing /home ?
[04:49] <PriceChild> kanzie, please run this:
[04:49] <PriceChild> sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.5.0-sun
[04:49] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, yes, if /home is on a separate partition, or if you back it up
[04:50] <SeamusLP> nolimitsoya: well what if you removed all of the packages installed by automatix?
[04:50] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, making a separate partition for home should be standard procediure when installing any linux distro...
[04:50] <Gartra1> right, i have "home" on a usb disk
[04:50] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, doesnt fix the breakage
[04:50] <Trixsey> Hey guys.. I just installed ATI drivers (fglrx) but I keep falling back to mesa.. I'm on edgy!
[04:50] <leobloom> uhm is there anyone who could help me ? I have a problem with skype and ubuntu 6.10 and I'm a newby!
[04:50] <Stormx2> minnmass: You could make a backup.
[04:50] <curs0r> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h57iIvPB1l0 <--my beryl demo needs hits lol
[04:50] <Trixsey> tips!? .8
[04:50] <Trixsey> trix? :(
[04:50] <jatt> !ask
[04:50] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:50] <nolimitsoya> SeamusLP, if youve been hozed by automatix, reinstall. itll save you time and grief
[04:50] <minnmass> nolimitsoya: true as that might be, ubuntu doesn't by default.
[04:50] <un_operateur> kanzie, sudo  update-alternatives --config java
[04:50] <PriceChild> Trixsey, have you followed a guide to install them?
[04:51] <wijnand> jatt: who was that for?
[04:51] <PriceChild> un_operateur, way ahead of you ;)
[04:51] <Stormx2> For leobloom
[04:51] <Trixsey> PriceChild, yeah I been trying for 10 hours straight
[04:51] <kanzie> PriceChild, done that before
[04:51] <jatt> wijnand: that was for leobloom.
[04:51] <minnmass> where would one go to suggest that it did that?  Or, to suggest the option at install, to not overwrite /home?
[04:51] <Trixsey> tried just about everything it feels like :P
[04:51] <un_operateur> PriceChild, on another plane ;)
[04:51] <kanzie> un_operateur, it is set for java-1.5.0
[04:51] <|cub|> hi people
[04:51] <Trixsey> whats the name of the ATI driver in the repos?
[04:51] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, im aware of that. thats simply becouse such a decision can only be made by the admin, and rule of thumbs dont work. if they did, itd be standard
[04:51] <Stormx2> hey |cub|
[04:51] <PriceChild> kanzie, could you pastebin the terminal ouput of "azureus"
[04:51] <wijnand> jatt: oh right, turns out i block those lines out, sorry! :P
[04:51] <Gartra1> eeegah... to many ppl
[04:51] <un_operateur> kanzie, among which other versions?
[04:51] <leobloom> sorry what was for me? I havent got it!
[04:51] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, you just set the mountboint of /home to be the partition that was previously /home
[04:51] <Gartra1> ive never experienced lag from IRC before
[04:52] <Stormx2> leobloom: Just ask a question :)
[04:52] <kanzie> un_operateur, /usr/bin/gij-wrapper-4.1 & /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/bin/java
[04:52] <Gartra1> lol
[04:52] <|cub|> can anyone tell me why /etc/init.d/networking cat be run at start automatically?
[04:53] <|cub|> cant*
[04:53] <leobloom> I have installed the debian pack of skype for ubuntu and i can use it but I can't talk anymore, the first tiem I've run it it worked perfectly, now it doesnt anymore, I can listen perfectly but the one talking to me hears nnothing at all =o/
[04:53] <kanzie> un_operateur, PriceChild all seems to work now... thank you very much
[04:53] <un_operateur> kanzie, glad to know that :)
[04:53] <PriceChild> kanzie, good to hear :)
[04:53] <leobloom> I'm not good with linux yet and dunno where to look to check what's wrong
[04:53] <PriceChild> leobloom, wha thave you changed ;)
[04:53] <kanzie> maybe someone knows how to get suspend to ram to work on a Thinkpad T60 on Edgy?
[04:53] <PriceChild> leobloom, checked your mic isn't muted? - simple things first
[04:54] <minnmass> leobloom: are you sure the microphone is plugged in?  That's bitten me a couple of times...
[04:54] <leobloom> the mic is plugged but dunno if it's muted how can I check it on ubuntu?
[04:54] <atIantis> |cub|, sudo update-rc.d network defaults   <~ i think that shoudl work, check man update-rc.d
[04:54] <un_operateur> leobloom, also verify that mic volume is up
[04:54] <|cub|> thnx
[04:54] <leobloom> again, how?=o9 sorry but I dunnowhere to looj
[04:54] <leobloom> *look for these things
[04:55] <un_operateur> leobloom, errm, i dont use gnome -- but it surely cant be hard to find in the main menu
[04:56] <un_operateur> leobloom, look for anything that resembles a speaker/mixer
[04:56] <minnmass> leobloom: double-click on the volume control to bring up the  mixer
[04:56] <atIantis> has anyone gotten Azureus to work on edgy?
[04:56] <kanzie> atIantis, using it right now
[04:56] <|cub|> atIantis, ill try to re-add...
[04:56] <vyouzhi> lol
[04:57] <leobloom> thanks minmass! the mic was uncheckd now I try to use it and see if it works
[04:57] <minnmass> leobloom: no problem.
[04:57] <leobloom> thanks a real lot it works!
[04:57] <lester_> does anyone know if subversion integration exists for nautilus? something like tortoisesvn on win32
[04:57] <Gartra1> is there anyway to truley kill popus?
[04:57] <Gartra1> popups*
[04:58] <kanzie> lester_, nope
[04:58] <minnmass> Shifting from "helpful" to "looking for help" ... aptitude doesn't upgrade without errors...
[04:58] <minnmass> ...neither does apt-get
[04:58] <SeamusLP> atIantis: I had problems with azureus crashing in edgy, so I downloaded version 5 of the official client
[04:58] <atIantis> kanzie, did you have to do anything sepcial to get it to work? i tried a simple apt-get, but get an error like 'no ssl support'.  ill try the source, i just like the packages because of the auto updates
[04:59] <atIantis> SeamusLP, i cant even get it to run, ill try the official client
[04:59] <assasukasse> hi everyone i have a problem with compiz
[04:59] <lester_> anyone managed to get window borders in beryl on edgy?
[04:59] <un_operateur> lester_, it's quite possible to add scripts to nautilus -- but they are only run when manually invoked -- perhaps not good enough for SVN
[04:59] <Trixsey> I'm running an ATI Radeon X700 Mobility and XGL.. I just installed the fglrx drivers but I keep falling back to mesa. Composite is disabled and I tried a whole lot of stuff like re-compiling fglrx. Tips? Anyone?
[05:00] <lester_> un_operateur, kanzie, ok
[05:00] <SeamusLP> atIantis: you may need to uninstall bittorrent/gnome-btdownload first

[05:01] <naylor> ps i'm on edgy
[05:01] <PriceChild> assasukasse, please ask in #beryl
[05:01] <PriceChild> assasukasse, or #ubuntu-xgl
[05:01] <nolimitsoya_> paranoia16, its better to ask "what do you think of.../is x compatible with.../how does dualboot work with..." etc
[05:02] <assasukasse> thanks PriceChild
[05:02] <minnmass> coreutils won't upgrade with aptitude or apt-get.  Please help!
[05:02] <un_operateur> naylor, did you mean f-spot ??  - personal photo management application >
[05:02] <gues1> is that nubuntu website expired???
[05:02] <paranoia16> is fedora core 6 as easy to use as ubuntu?
[05:03] <|cub|> atIantis, it helped. thnx
[05:03] <naylor> un_operateur, yeah f-spot sorry that's what i meant
[05:03] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> paranoia16 ,depends from person to person ?
[05:03] <un_operateur> paranoia16, FC6 might be -- but earlier versions had problems with dependancies
[05:03] <nolimitsoya_> paranoia16, as its rpm based, id say no. youll end up in dependency hell in no time at all
[05:03] <zi1> hi all anyone in here use gpsdrive
[05:03] <robin> hello
[05:03] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> but i never found it easy.... atleast Ubuntu is much easier...
[05:03] <un_operateur> !f-spot
[05:03] <ubotu> f-spot: personal photo management application. In component main, is optional. Version 0.2.1-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 573 kB, installed size 3396 kB
[05:04] <paranoia16> well, i was thinking of switching to is because i think it supports lightscribe

[05:04] <kupesoft> I'm having trouble finding documentation detailing the installation of a fax server for Ubuntu,

[05:04] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> !Hi | robin  , zi
[05:04] <ubotu> robin  , zi: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[05:04] <SeamusLP> nolimitsoya_: RPM still doesn't have dependency resolution?
[05:04] <naylor> un_operateur, how do i get to this?
[05:04] <un_operateur> kupesoft, they ought to work
[05:04] <paranoia16> is it supposed to support lightscibe? on the lightscribe.com, it has a .rpm, so fedora supports it, right?
[05:04] <nolimitsoya_> SeamusLP, a very crude one, that more othen than not is broken
[05:04] <robin> #ubuntu-uk on irc.freenode.org
[05:04] <un_operateur> naylor, -- sudo aptitude install f-spot   ought to work
[05:05] <gues1> anyone pz help
[05:05] <robin> #ubuntu-uk on irc.freenode.net
[05:05] <robin> ubuntu-uk on irc.freenode.net
[05:05] <kupesoft> robin: stop.
[05:05] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> paranoia16 ,if it works on FC i don't see why it shouldn't work on Ubuntu though...
[05:05] <fkumro> paranoia16, why not use alien and convert the rpm
[05:05] <naylor> un_operateur, but that just gives me the normal 0.2 version that comes with edgy
[05:05] <lester_> robin dude.. we know..
[05:05] <un_operateur> SeamusLP, the RPM has dependency resolution capabilities -- its just that authors of packages dont verify them or ensure the right ones
[05:05] <CaBlGuY> I'm running 6.10 Edgy and have froze up and had to shut my box down and reboot twice now in the past 2 days...   whats the deal??
[05:05] <Trixsey> I'm running an ATI Radeon X700 Mobility and XGL.. I just installed the fglrx drivers but I keep falling back to mesa. Composite is disabled and I tried a whole lot of stuff like re-compiling fglrx. Tips? Anyone?
[05:05] <zi1> robin type / join first
[05:06] <un_operateur> naylor, the latest version in the pool is  0.3.0-0ubuntu1
[05:06] <SeamusLP> CaBlGuY:  did your entire system freeze, or could you do ctrl-alt-backspace and restart X?
[05:06] <CaBlGuY> SeamusLP:  entire system froze..
[05:06] <naylor> un_operateur, how do i add this repo?
[05:07] <paranoia16> i tried that. but, after i "install", it didn't add anything to the start menu. im new, and i haven't quite figured out the file structure. where do programs "install"
[05:07] <nolimitsoya_> paranoia16, just type the name of the program in a terminal
[05:07] <paranoia16> how can i make a shortcut?
[05:07] <SeamusLP> CaBlGuY you may have some buggy drivers. What are you doing when it locks up? does it appear to happen randomly?
[05:07] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> paranoia16 ,start terminal and type lightscribe
[05:07] <minnmass> paranoia16: have you tried launching from the teriminal?  just type the name of the program you want.
[05:07] <fkumro> paranoia16, tab completion is your friend
[05:07] <atIantis> SeamusLP, i had gnome-btdownload install, but uninstalled, i get an error that seems to be from 'No SSL provider avalible'
[05:07] <nolimitsoya_> paranoia16, they are called launchers. rightclick in the right place :)
[05:08] <CaBlGuY> SeamusLP:  yes, happenes randomly..   I wasn't doing the same thing eather time..
[05:08] <SeamusLP> atIantis you need to uninstall bittorrent too, then run the bittorrent5 deb
[05:08] <minnmass> paranoia16: if it runs, you can type "which <program>" in the terminal, and that will tell you where the program lives.

[05:12] <paranoia16> on the lightscribe website, it mentions it doesn't support debian, but will alien make it compatable?

[05:14] <CaBlGuY> and eveyone else except SeamusLP can BLOW ME!   ;o)
[05:14] <minnmass> robin: try aptitude; "/<text>" will search for <text> - "/xine" will search for xine, and should find what you want to install.

[05:18] <leobloom> ok, I'm deleting it, hope I'm just deleting the software and nothing else that is important lol :D

[05:18] <TehBigToe> and if I press esc to go to the grub menu and select any option
[05:18] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, do it again, but don't press Esc when it "suggests"
[05:18] <SeamusLP> this ubotu thing is pretty cool
[05:18] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: I didn't
[05:18] <zi1> some help would be great
[05:18] <minnmass> Pricechild: same error: `unable to make backup link of `./bin/ls` before installing new version: Operation not permitted
[05:18] <TehBigToe> recovery mode, norecovery mode, memtest
[05:18] <TehBigToe> it just goes back to the bios screen
[05:18] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, hmm ok... all of them?
[05:18] <TehBigToe> mhm
[05:19] <BlackHawk> hi
[05:19] <TehBigToe> I'm currently using gaim on the live CD :S
[05:19] <Trixsey>  I'm running an ATI Radeon X700 Mobility and XGL.. I just installed the fglrx drivers but I keep falling back to mesa. Composite is disabled and I tried a whole lot of stuff like re-compiling fglrx. Tips? Anyone? My xorg.conf: http://www.mathbin.net/2536
[05:19] <Trixsey> added the conf now :p
[05:19] <SeamusLP> zil: I'm not sure what that is, but if you're looking for help with a particular piece of software its better to find a forum or irc channel dedicated to it
[05:19] <leobloom> ist it noraml that on my terminal it says "uninstalling ubuntu-desktop" and then "ninstalling ekiga"?
[05:19] <robin> any one like windows aswll as ubuntu] 
[05:19] <zi1> there is one person in there not talking
[05:20] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, what have you changed with the grub exactly?
[05:20] <compilerwriter> robin I prefer ubuntu for most things but am forced to use windows for some things
[05:20] <PriceChild> leobloom, that's normal... i already explained :)
[05:20] <un_operateur> leobloom, usually that shouldnt be a problem unless you need ekiga for something else -- you can always install it later
[05:20] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: nothing
[05:20] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, promise?
[05:20] <TehBigToe> promise
[05:20] <robin> at skl i am forced to use windoze
[05:21] <TehBigToe> it might be linked to the fact I had a power cut last night, so the PC didn't shut down properly :S
[05:21] <leobloom> and what about the big amountof updates? a guy on edubuntu chan told me it's normal since I've just installed ubuntu from the iso but I really dunno what I'm installing so I simply trust the things my pc ticks :D
[05:21] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, was it performing updates at hte time?
[05:21] <TehBigToe> nope
[05:21] <robin> NYONE USE CUBUNTU
[05:21] <SeamusLP> Trixsey: that config file looks good to me, maybe you could post your xorg log?
[05:21] <tuxub> what are the names of the kernels in edgy? i can't find a SMP kernel for my AMD 2x CPU :(
[05:21] <robin> my friend programmed it
[05:21] <PriceChild> leobloom, whatever version of ubuntu you have installed ,its been out for months... security updates etc .will be added
[05:22] <PriceChild> !anyone > robin
[05:22] <compilerwriter> robin to you mean Kubuntu?
[05:22] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: I think I broke my file system
[05:22] <TehBigToe> when I try to access it in the live cd
[05:22] <robin> no
[05:22] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, can you mount it in the live cd?
[05:22] <Trixsey> SeamusLP, where is the xorg log?
[05:22] <TehBigToe> error: device /dev/hda1 is not removable error: could not execute pmount
[05:22] <robin> a command line ubuntu callec ubuntu
[05:22] <TehBigToe> no PriceChild, ^
[05:22] <robin> cubuntu*
[05:22] <bretzel> hi there, I have Intel 945GM, xorg.conf + beryl ok but:"libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b" from beryl and bzflag game... ? any clue ?
[05:22] <leobloom> oh perfect, so as long as I instal the security updates and the reccomended ones I'll have no crashes? I really dunno how to deal with stuff like that on linux yet, I've had it only for 2 days :D (and I adore it :D )
[05:23] <SeamusLP> tuxub: I think the default kernel has SMP support
[05:23] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, sudo mkdir /media/tmp && sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/tmp
[05:23] <robin> beryl works fine for me and i have that intel
[05:23] <PriceChild> leobloom, hopefully :)
[05:23] <naylor_> un_operateur, hi added those in manually but it still won't update f-spot to 0.3, if i get deb file directly then dependencies not met.. i'm confused, how come this is not available in synaptics if it's in repos?
[05:23] <SeamusLP> Trixsey /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[05:23] <compilerwriter> Never tried Cubuntu robin
[05:23] <TehBigToe> ok PriceChild
[05:23] <PriceChild> leobloom, whenever there are updates, it'll tell you in your notification area top right with a orange square
[05:23] <tuxub> SeamusLP, model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+  only one...
[05:23] <bretzel> robin, for me too but bzflag runs as if there is no accel ( unplayable)
[05:23] <un_operateur> naylor, you need to do these before you can use those repos --- sudo sh -c "aptitude update; aptitude upgrade"
[05:24] <leobloom> yep exactly, I've had it today, double clicked and the synaptic started
[05:24] <SeamusLP> tuxub do cat /proc/cpuinfo | less and see how many processors it shows
[05:24] <tuxub> SeamusLP, already did that : one
[05:24] <robin> can someone give me a link or a dvd decoder for ubuntu/totem
[05:24] <SeamusLP> tuxub are you running dapper or edgy?
[05:24] <tuxub> SeamusLP, edgy (dist-upgraded from dapper)
[05:25] <robin> feisty
[05:25] <PriceChild> !codecs | robin
[05:25] <ubotu> robin: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[05:25] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: /me waits

[05:25] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[05:25] <SeamusLP> tuxub did you have smp support in dapper?
[05:25] <PriceChild> what'd it tell you TehBigToe ?
[05:25] <PriceChild> un_operateur, even better :)
[05:25] <TehBigToe> ok
[05:25] <tuxub> SeamusLP, i installed this linux-k7-smp and got 2 cpus... but no grahpics because my nvidia driver is for the edgy kernel
[05:25] <un_operateur> PriceChild, :)
[05:25] <tuxub> SeamusLP, yes...
[05:25] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: it did nothing for about 20 secs
[05:26] <robin> come someone else apart from ubotu help me with dvd decoding on totem
[05:26] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, then...?
[05:26] <nolimitsoya_> tuxub, the generic kernel has smp support
[05:26] <mattl> jono: getting much traffic from digg?
[05:26] <leobloom> might I ruin something if I instal the easyubuntu package?
[05:26] <SeamusLP> tuxub yeah I think you need to switch to the generic edgy kernel
[05:26] <TehBigToe> then it gave me the user@thing again
[05:26] <bretzel> robin: automatix(2)
[05:26] <robin> DVD DECODING PLZ!
[05:26] <tuxub> SeamusLP, what is its name?
[05:26] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, cd /media/tmp && ls
[05:26] <TehBigToe> ok
[05:26] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, actually...
[05:26] <nolimitsoya_> !automatix | robin bretzel
[05:26] <ubotu> robin bretzel: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:26] <robin> how do i get automatix 2
[05:26] <jono> mattl: you could say that, the server is getting hammered :P
[05:26] <tuxub> v   linux-image <-- this ?
[05:26] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, cd /media/tmp/home/<<whatever your username is>> && ls
[05:26] <userek> I want to disable cupsys service, is `update-rc.d -f cupsys remove` a proper way to do it?
[05:27] <SeamusLP> tuxub http://www.mathbin.net/2536
[05:27] <SeamusLP> tuxub err
[05:27] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: looks ok
[05:27] <nolimitsoya_> robin, please. i gave you a link before that would have sorted you out. follow links when you get them, stup whining and stop SHOUTING
[05:27] <mattl> jono: i'll host your site, but only if you renounce your proprietary drivers! ;)
[05:27] <SeamusLP> tuxub linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic
[05:27] <nolimitsoya_> *stop
[05:27] <bretzel> robin: automatix didnot breaks anything yet for me since dapper
[05:27] <userek> uhm, anyone?
[05:27] <nolimitsoya_> !worksforme | bretzel
[05:27] <ubotu> bretzel: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[05:27] <robin> can u give me the  command to install it
[05:27] <jono> mattl: heh, I just added a comment in which you were mentioned
[05:27] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, if you can see your files? then nothing's too broken :)
[05:27] <mattl> oh god.
[05:28] <nolimitsoya_> bretzel, weve already had this conversation once in here today, and im not up for it again
[05:28] <tuxub> SeamusLP, already installed... i think its the one I have installed Linux maia 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Tue Dec 5 22:26:18 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[05:28] <naylor_> un_operateur, is there no way to add the pool as a repo?
[05:28] <userek> is this question too dificulit or what
[05:28] <bretzel> robin: but dunnot forget to restore repos before exiting automatix -- for dvd codecs, use automatix... not for all tho
[05:28] <leobloom> ehm nobody answered i suppose there will be no problem if I install the easyubuntu then right?
[05:28] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, you may like to try "sudo umount /dev/hda1 && sudo fsck /dev/hda1" to check the partition
[05:28] <TehBigToe> ok
[05:28] <userek> TehBigToe if /dev/hda1 is your / it won't work
[05:28] <nolimitsoya_> leobloom, shouldnt be, no. but imho its better to know what you are doing instead or running scripts you dont understand
[05:29] <mattl> jono: okay, i can't handle that. you know someone told me i should kill myself yesterday because the fsf has a campaign against Vista?
[05:29] <astronaute> hello
[05:29] <SeamusLP> tuxub well the generic kernel does have smp support, you just need to make it the default kernel in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[05:29] <tuxub> SeamusLP, i think its the dapper 2 edgy upgrade fault... (passed from 3/4 failure to 4/4 failure) :(
[05:29] <mattl> jono: can handle that.
[05:29] <naylor_> un_operateur, it says dependency i need is libc6
[05:29] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: seems i had to cd / first :P
[05:29] <TehBigToe> but yeah
[05:29] <tuxub> SeamusLP, Its the running kernel (i ran uname -a)
[05:29] <TehBigToe> fsck said it was clean
[05:29] <robin> ik have a p2 in my loft lol
[05:29] <un_operateur> naylor, the pool is added as a repo if you ran the command i gave you last
[05:29] <mpan> i use following command to backup system but sometimes it is not working. the command is 'mondoarchive -Or -F -e -s 4380m -d /dev/dvd' and error messages are glibc detected.. double free or corruption and segmentation fault. gui of mondo has similar problems.
[05:29] <astronaute> can someone tell me if its possible to isntall ubunto on intel core 2 duo MB : Asus P5W DH Deluxe
[05:29] <leobloom> nolimits if I had to understand what I'm doing I think i'd have never scwitched to ubuntu and linux lol :D
[05:29] <mpan> distribution is ubuntu 6.06
[05:29] <astronaute> i have errors on live cd boot, tested with 386 and amd64
[05:29] <un_operateur> naylor, yea, you need that package for quite a few others too -- might as well install it
[05:29] <mpan> do you have similar problems?
[05:30] <SeamusLP> tuxub and it only shows one cpu in /proc/cpuinfo?
[05:30] <nolimitsoya_> leobloom, thats why we have the capability to learn :) learn what it is you need and install it, instead of letting a script do it for you
[05:30] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, hmm ok... could you remount it with the command earlier, then pastebin your /media/tmp/boot/grub/menu.lst to check that's correct
[05:30] <astronaute> please guys, anyone run ubunto on core 2 duo ???
[05:30] <naylor_> un_operateur, sorry my nick changed and i didn't see, i'll check out what you put
[05:30] <PriceChild> !anyone > astronaute
[05:31] <un_operateur> naylor_, you need to do these before you can use those repos --- sudo sh -c "aptitude update; aptitude upgrade"
[05:31] <SeamusLP> !anyone | astronaute
[05:31] <tuxub> SeamusLP, yes
[05:31] <ubotu> astronaute: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:31] <un_operateur> naylor, that was the command i posted laste
[05:31] <astronaute> great, but i asked a question actually =)))
[05:31] <robin> i installed automatix and vd still doesnt play on totem
[05:31] <astronaute> here my error : http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=634215
[05:31] <astronaute> and hardware
[05:31] <robin> and i can open automatix if its a program
[05:31] <nolimitsoya_> robin, you arent paying the least bit of attention are you?
[05:31] <astronaute> if someone can take a look on error please i dont know what to do
[05:32] <robin> no!
[05:32] <MenZa> I often get "E: Unable to lock the administration directory, is another process using it?" even when I'm not using it. Why, and how do I stop it?
[05:32] <MenZa> killall dpg?
[05:32] <MenZa> dkpg*
[05:32] <robin> i o to another window and  when i come bk peoples things have gone
[05:32] <astronaute> http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=652419#p652419
[05:32] <astronaute> this one especialy
[05:32] <un_operateur> MenZa, you probably need to run the command as sudo ??? :)
[05:32] <naylor_> un_operateur, it's still not updating it - it's giving me this: http://pastebin.ca/285092
[05:32] <leobloom> ok, you know what? I won't instal it, all in al I don't need it yet =o)
[05:32] <nolimitsoya_> MenZa, are you trying to run two instances of apt/ynaptic/aptitude at the same time?
[05:33] <astronaute> or if it is not posssible to install it just tell me i will switch to windows meanwhile waiting for ubuntu to be compatible
[05:33] <nolimitsoya_> *synaptic
[05:33] <robin> can some dud actually send me a command thgat actually makes dvd's decoded on totem
[05:33] <SeamusLP> tuxub I'm not sure what the deal is, sorry

[05:33] <PriceChild> radar1976, hello
[05:34] <tuxub> SeamusLP, thanks anyway
[05:34] <MenZa> no radar1976_alt
[05:34] <un_operateur> naylor, it's definitely likely that f-spot at that version has not made it into the Edgy packages -- your only alternative is to instlal the new version manually
[05:34] <radar1976_alt> hmmm thanks
[05:34] <leobloom> can I ask something rahter weird?
[05:34] <MenZa> nolimitsoya_: I start aptitude, but close it when I realise I typed the packagename wrong
[05:34] <PriceChild> leobloom, go for it
[05:34] <astronaute> so noone runs ubuntu on core 2 duo intel here ?? possible / not possible plz guys =)

[05:34] <ubotu> astronaute: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:34] <lester_> gnomefreak, no result after changing xorg.conf settings
[05:35] <naylor_> un_operateur, i downloaded the deb file you gave me the link for but it says it needs libc6, can i download a deb of this from anywhere?
[05:35] <jordo23> Does EDGY have built in support for sound blasters?
[05:35] <FernandoCordes> is there an irc client which is able to take up dcc advertisements?
[05:35] <nolimitsoya_> astronaute, what your problem? ask that instead
[05:35] <astronaute> PriceChild go wank plz =)
[05:35] <computermc> does anyone know of a mysql admin program that I can use, since the mysql-admin crashes each time you try to change user information?

[05:35] <computermc> looking for one that is open source
[05:35] <computermc> that has a GUI
[05:35] <un_operateur> naylor_, you should be able to -- sudo aptitude install libc6
[05:35] <DjViper> computermc: open office ?
[05:35] <leobloom> I have two os on my pc now ubuntu on one hd and winxp trial on the other, my modem drivers are on the winxp but it'll stop working in 25 days so well, what will happen to my connection? I haven't been able to find a way to install the modem drivers of my adsl modem on linux ubuntu won't even open the exe to install them =o/
[05:36] <computermc> DjViper: for mysql databases?
[05:36] <gnomefreak> lester_: i would wait for someone more experienced in beryl/xgl to help
[05:36] <PriceChild> leobloom, what adsl modem is it?
[05:36] <lester_> gnomefreak, ok
[05:36] <PriceChild> leobloom, is it a usb one?
[05:36] <DjViper> computermc: yup
[05:36] <leobloom> don't remeber the name let me check if they say it on the package

[05:37] <leobloom> cge libro ?
[05:37] <robin> sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
[05:37] <DjViper> computermc: if you're running apache+php and are only doing basic stuff you could use phpmyadmin
[05:37] <radar1976_alt> I'm having a problem with my synaptics touchpad  log output here... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37916/  any ideas?
[05:37] <mralphabet> leobloom: usb? ethernet?
[05:37] <SeamusLP> leobloom: usually you can use an ethernet cable to plug into your modem, no extra drivers required
[05:37] <leobloom> via ethernet, and I used the sudo pppoe conf command to use the connection on linux
[05:37] <computermc> DjViper: can you change the user information with phpmyadmin?
[05:37] <robin> would there be aby reason y sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
[05:37] <robin> wouldnt work
[05:37] <computermc> like passwords
[05:37] <DjViper> computermc: hmm yes
[05:37] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: copying single "pages" from nano is tedious, how do you view the whole file in the terminal?
[05:38] <un_operateur> naylor_, can you tell me what this returns  -- dpkg -l | grep -i libc6
[05:38] <PriceChild> leobloom, if its ethernet, then you shouldn't need any "rubbish software" they make you think they need
[05:38] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, cat <filename>
[05:38] <TehBigToe> ah, thanks
[05:38] <robin> can anyone help me
=== flask_ is now known as flask-
[05:38] <DjViper> computermc: you can do most things, its just not practical for most things, like inserting large amounts of data
[05:38] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37918/
[05:38] <leobloom> sure? so I could techinically also erase winXP without any problem?

[05:40] <un_operateur> naylor_, ok, i could suggest something radical -- but first -- is there a specific reason you want f-spot at version 0.3.0 ??
[05:40] <PriceChild> robin: Yeah i found problems with the wiki guide on edgy actually.
[05:40] <SeamusLP> leobloom if you get to a point where you're comfortable in ubuntu you could reinstall using the entire hard drive.  I don't run windows on my boxes.
[05:40] <DjViper> computermc: that depends on if your apache server and/or that dir where it resides is safe
[05:40] <cbx33> howz it going leobloom
[05:40] <FernandoCordes> is there a good irc client special for xdcc client purposes?
[05:40] <PriceChild> robin: please download the deb via the manual method which is documented on that wiki page
[05:41] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, that looks fine....
[05:41] <computermc> DjViper: ok thanks

[05:41] <ubotu> robin: Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[05:41] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: :S
[05:41] <DanaG> Thus, my brightness control does not work.
[05:41] <cbx33> guys I was goign to do a short screencast on usign the terminal for n00bs - anyone got any suggestions for BASIC concepts
[05:41] <kane77> hi
[05:41] <jrib> robin: seveas' repositories has debs for libdvdcss, use them instead
[05:41] <naylor_> un_operateur, it's just little things like tagging photos etc you can drag and it'll move to tag without having to use scrollbars etc first. i set it up for my dad who is not too good on computers and 0.3 is easier to use
[05:41] <leobloom> but I think I won't need winxp amnymore and all in all the trial i have will be over in january so I either reinstall it for one month or simply erase it all and use the other hd as a skave hd for ubuntu
[05:41] <kane77> why do I always get a message saying that HAL failed to hibrenate??
[05:41] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, what _exactly_ did you change
[05:41] <cbx33> leobloom, best i dea in my opinion
[05:41] <lester_> gnomefreak, i'm not seeing the nvidia splash either.. does this mean that the driver isn't loaded correctly?
[05:41] <DanaG> so...... what can I do to fix it?
[05:42] <narvik86> cbx33: cd, ls, sudo, dpkg,
[05:42] <Invisible_> how do i edit files with vi editor?
[05:42] <cbx33> top
[05:42] <cbx33> vi
[05:42] <cbx33> ;)
[05:42] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: nothing!
[05:42] <cbx33> Invisible_, use nano
[05:42] <Invisible_> to insert any values i need hit Inser or I
[05:42] <Invisible_> but its not happening
[05:42] <narvik86> cbx33: mcedit is easier if you have mc installed :)
[05:42] <jrib> Invisible_: vi /path/to/file     run 'vimtutor' for a quick tutorial
[05:42] <cbx33> it's easier for people new to the command line
[05:42] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, ok then we'll need to reinstall grub i think
[05:42] <DjViper> vi sux
[05:42] <TehBigToe> :/
[05:42] <jrib> Invisible_: if you are just interested in editing a file and don't want to learn to use vi, use nano
[05:42] <cbx33> vi is cool - but nano is easier for a lot of things
[05:42] <DjViper> Invisible_: use gedit if gnome is running
[05:42] <TehBigToe> that sounds like hard
[05:43] <naylor_> un_operateur, why is it libc6 isn't spotted? why do we need to be radical? is it anything to do with this: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-196988.html
[05:43] <un_operateur> naylor, hmm, well -- you could upgrade to feisty and those packages will become available -- or you have to manually download an install f-spot, lic6 and all it's deps , and they are quite numerous
[05:43] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, not at all :)
[05:43] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, one second
[05:43] <TehBigToe> ok
[05:43] <SeamusLP> cbx33: I recommend going over mv, cp, pwd, ls, cat, find, grep, locate
[05:43] <radar1976_alt> did anyone see my log, any ideas?
[05:43] <Invisible_> i do not have gui

[05:44] <PriceChild> TehBigToe, you want to install to hda1 - otherwise known as (hd0,0)
[05:44] <naylor_> un_operateur, what's this for? i don't really wanna update to feisty...
[05:44] <TehBigToe> PriceChild: I'm already stuck
[05:44] <Wooksta> i had the same problem when i was in 64bit and DBO managed to fix it but i cant remember what the first step is :<

[05:46] <un_operateur> naylor_, yes

[05:47] <un_operateur> naylor_, ok, one sec
[05:47] <Wooksta> 2.6.17-10-generic
[05:47] <FunnyLookinHat> Jonn`, you have to install a package that will allow you to write to NTFS, by default ubuntu can only read to it

[05:48] <leobloom> does any of you know an OS called link? I've checked the website of my provider, I suppose they meant linux and that's just a typo
[05:48] <Wooksta> brb
[05:48] <FunnyLookinHat> Jonn`, that

[05:49] <YnG> PriceChild: yea, but this faild because need some files
[05:49] <YnG> *fail
[05:50] <FunnyLookinHat> Jonn`, the package i was trying to think of is called:    libntfs-3g0  (that's a zero, not an O)
[05:50] <PriceChild> Jonn`, FunnyLookinHat, please be aware that its still unstable and may cause dataloss in rare events
[05:50] <killermach> I need to patch the i810 video driver, any hints on how to do this on ubuntu??

[05:50] <mrlinux> how do i mount a cdrom drive on a client machine  i am using LTSP
[05:50] <un_operateur> naylor_, can you bear with me a couple of minutes -- theres something i need to do ?
[05:50] <Jonn`> alright alright.
[05:50] <Jonn`> I will have to try it anyway...
[05:51] <naylor_> un_operateur, ok sure - i'll just go to bathroom!
[05:51] <TehBigToe> I'll stick around... knowing me I'll have lots more problems for you to sort out :P
[05:51] <FunnyLookinHat> Jonn`, he is correct, it is technically not  a stable solution yet, although the company that makes it will say elsewise...   I would check ubuntuforums.og to see if anyone else has installed it and used it , you may just have to install the package & reboot or more configuration may be required
[05:51] <YnG> PriceChild: i'll back later, thanxs
[05:51] <Jonn`> alright
[05:51] <The> hey
[05:51] <The> i'm new to this
[05:51] <mrlinux> how do i mount a cdrom drive on a client machine  i am using LTSP
[05:51] <Jonn`> I started to check in the community documentations but i didnt have much luck
[05:51] <minnmass> coreutils won't update; breaks apt-get and aptitude.  Tips?
[05:51] <PriceChild> FunnyLookinHat, Jonn`, it is VERY unlikely you will lose data... there has been extensive testing on it... but i'm still warning you :)

[05:52] <FunnyLookinHat> stonarmusic, if you are writing via samba over a network, it works fine...  if you are talking about writing to an NTFS partition on the same computer...  yo ucan try libnfts-3g0      it's technically unstable but most people have had a lot of luck with it

[05:53] <DanaG> And you can NOT write to compressed NTFS.
[05:54] <naylor_> un_operateur, ok i'm back... let me know when ready
[05:54] <DanaG> Oh, wait, if it's a share, then it's networked?
[05:54] <PriceChild> robin please don't
[05:54] <DanaG> That's just samba.
[05:54] <robin> ban/danag
[05:54] <PriceChild> DanaG,  correct

[05:54] <Jonn`> brb
[05:54] <robin> robin is only 13
[05:54] <DanaG> aah, then the fact that it's NTFS is irrelevant as long as the host is using NT/2K/XP

[05:56] <leobloom> i says it'd conflict with somethign already installed but I have nothing liek that I think
[05:56] <strabes> leobloom: try using aptitude instead of apt-get
[05:56] <apokryphos> nolimitsoya_: thanks
[05:57] <stonarmusic> 21 hex
[05:57] <strabes> leobloom: and if that doesn't work, we have some problems

[05:59] <TehBigToe> 6.06 is 2gb according to the shipit CDs
[05:59] <TehBigToe> 2gb min
[05:59] <DanaG> Google search for 'Linux acpi video brightness' -- the second link from the bottom, about the Dell, is the relevant one.
[05:59] <leobloom> ok can I post the thing it says  that is not satisfied?
[05:59] <Wooksta> jrib got it all working now, thanks :)

[06:05] <aanhorn> thanks, ubotu, i'll take a look
[06:05] <minnmass> !pastbin
[06:05] <naylor_> un_operateur, ok cool what do i do?
[06:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pastbin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:05] <minnmass> !pastebin
[06:05] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:05] <leobloom> sorry guys but the geidt/etc/apt/sources.list doesn't work, should I write the sudo before or what?
[06:05] <DanaG> Damn emu<10k1> doesn't support suspend.  Perhaps I should replace it with a llama.
[06:05] <jrib> leobloom: no, you made a typo
[06:05] <stefg> leobloom, try it with correct spelling :-)
[06:05] <naylor_> un_operateur, ok getting libc6 or whatever now
[06:05] <Wooksta> http://www.debianadmin.com/install-automatix2-in-ubuntukubuntuxubuntu.html  <--- im following this tutorial to try and install Automatix2 on edgy but im having problems with the gpg-import and export lines, can anyone help?
[06:06] <strabes> blue\\: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
[06:06] <un_operateur> naylor_, basically, I've started you off with libc6 there -- download the file (link at the bottom of that page -- I386) .. download it and try and install via -- sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb
[06:06] <lmosher> Is there a wireless network program that I can get that will detect and connect to a set of ESSID's? I.E. so that if I go to work and home it will automatically connect to whichever network it finds?? It's annoying to switch and in Windows it works just fine.
[06:06] <jrib> Wooksta: join #automatix for help with automatix
[06:06] <DanaG> network-manager-gnome
[06:06] <Wooksta> ok
[06:06] <leobloom>  gedit/etc/apt/sources.list
[06:06] <leobloom> ? it doesn't work =o/
[06:06] <strabes> blue\\: I believe your card supports the open source ati driver. try it out
[06:06] <jrib> leobloom: space after "gedit"
[06:06] <un_operateur> naylor_, if libc6 complains about missing deps .. search for them -- download, install, etc -- repeat the process
[06:07] <un_operateur> leobloom, sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:07] <DanaG> and here's a tip: NEVER EVER REMOVE libc6.
[06:07] <DanaG> I made that mistake once, and not even a chroot could fix it.
[06:07] <blue\\> strabes: i will. thanks for the tip
[06:07] <un_operateur> DanaG, I dont think you can even if you wanted to -- its one of the most vital packages
[06:08] <DanaG> (dpkg with --force-<anything> can be very dangerous, as I found out.)
[06:08] <pike_> Wooksta: isnt automatix a script to make installing things easier? if its hard to install whats the point? just use wiki
[06:08] <blue\\> strabes: uh - acctually i wont be able to use that driver :'(
[06:08] <minnmass> jrbi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37925/
[06:08] <DanaG> Right now I have the Feisty repos enabled, but set to zero priority in /etc/apt/preferences.
[06:08] <strabes> pike_ Wooksta: it's not hard to install - it's four commands www.getautomatix.com
[06:08] <DanaG> I just installed the new NVIDIA drivers from there.

[06:09] <strabes> blue\\: then you'll have to use fglrx: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[06:09] <strabes> xenonn31: is the ntfs drive mounted?
[06:09] <xenonn31> strabes, yes, but I didn't touch fstab
[06:09] <un_operateur> DanaG, you can force anything -- but that's really not how it should work
[06:09] <Spacelvis> strabes: I tried installing Automatix today, but it won't start; it says something about not being able to fetch keys...?
[06:09] <jrib> minnmass: is this a botched upgrade from dapper?
[06:09] <DanaG> s/every package/every single binary in existence/
[06:10] <DanaG> more like.
[06:10] <minnmass> jrib: it is an upgrade from dapper, but it upgraded okay, and was "apt-get update" and "apg-get upgrade" -ing fine for a while.
[06:10] <un_operateur> DanaG, well, not if the binary was compiled in something other than C/C++
[06:10] <xenonn31> strabes, is mounted, but I can't write, maybe i should change fstab options, but I don't know what

[06:11] <strabes> xenonn31: sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/mount/location

[06:12] <un_operateur> Spacelvis, the automatix servers are down -- as we found out earlier today
[06:12] <jrib> leobloom: yes, then pastebin the output
[06:12] <MarcN> lmosher: network-manager
[06:12] <Spacelvis> ah, ok, that explains it!
[06:12] <jrib> minnmass: you have the dapper version of that package
[06:12] <strabes> lmosher: i believe network-manager-gnome will do that
[06:12] <xenonn31> thanks a lot strabes
[06:12] <strabes> xenonn31: did it work?
[06:12] <lmosher> MarcN, strabes Ok I'll check that out.
[06:13] <strabes> lmosher: it runs it your notification area so once you install it it will start up with gnome, but for now just run network-manager-gnome &
[06:13] <minnmass> jrib: I suppose I could see that causing problems.  Any suggestions for fixing it?
[06:13] <xenonn31> strabes, oh no, I thought so, but it doesn't work.
[06:13] <leobloom> ok done it http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37928/

[06:14] <xenonn31> strabes,  i think i have to change fstab but i don't know what i have to change

[06:14] <strabes> DanaG: nm-applet is network-manager
[06:14] <strabes> DanaG: network-manager is the package name
[06:14] <leobloom> ok, sorry
[06:14] <lmosher> strabes, yeah. I guess my question is, do I need to remove this existing applet or should I just remove it from the panel?

[06:15] <naylor_> un_operateur, ok cool thanks man
[06:15] <DanaG> Oddly, my nm-applet shows "no connection" even though I'm on wired.

[06:16] <strabes> ?
[06:16] <Spacelvis> not yet, I'm not on the Ubuntu PC as we speak... Booting it up again now

[06:19] <jrib> minnmass: what's this command?
[06:19] <minnmass> jrib: I've tried googling, but haven't found anything...
[06:20] <naylor_> un_operateur, hi i can't install libpango cos it needs libpango-common but that won't install either cos that needs libpango!!
[06:20] <minnmass> jrib: that was "sudo aptitude install coreutils"
[06:20] <jrib> leobloom: find out if cinepaint really needs that dependency.  If it doesn't then i would download the source pacakge, remove the deb, and rebuild it
[06:20] <minnmass> jrib: as an administrative user
[06:21] <leobloom> eheh you now you are talking to a newby don't you?=o) I have no idea how to rebuild a package lol
[06:21] <webben> Is anyone using (regularly) OOo 2.1 ?
[06:21] <Spacelvis> Strabes: Yep, the keys for automatix can be fetched now! They discovered that the "keys"-folder (www.getautomatix.com/keys) was missing, but now they've restored it!
[06:21] <naylor_> un_operateur, http://pastebin.ca/285148
[06:21] <jrib> leobloom: I'll walk you through, it's simple.  But find out if it really requires that dependency first
[06:21] <Spacelvis> thanx for the help! :-)
[06:21] <webben> (and if so, how have they found it? okay? better? worse? buggy?)
[06:21] <lmosher> strabes, I installed network-manager and network-manager-gnome, but "network-manager-gnome" isn't a command. (using tab completion only network-admin shows up)
[06:21] <strabes> Spacelvis: np
[06:21] <un_operateur> naylor-- you can always force one to install  -- sudo dpkg --force-depends filename.deb
[06:22] <DanaG> aah, I had to comment out the lines in /etc/network/interfaces
[06:22] <strabes> lmosher: network-manager-gnome is only the package name. run nm-applet with an & sign after it to run it in the background
[06:22] <un_operateur> minnmass, have you tried this command as a normal user?? not as root?
[06:22] <DanaG> I had it on DHCP, but with the static info still there.
[06:22] <strabes> lmosher: so it wolud be "nm-applet &"

[06:24] <leobloom> strabes I'm trying to see if someone has already posted a solution somewhere, if not nevermind, I was just curious to see how this software is, I've read it's extremely good
[06:25] <DanaG> The problem is that it DOES open at login, and I want it to NOT open at login.
[06:25] <strabes> leobloom: have you tried finding a .deb online and instaling that?

[06:26] <leobloom> strabes nope, I don't even know how to look for it, I've had linux ubuntu only for 2 days
[06:26] <lmosher> DanaG, ah ok yeah it only has loopback I need to enable eth1

[06:29] <ubotu> CarCase928: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[06:29] <Spacelvis> slicslak: ok, will chek out easyubuntu. I'm just preparing a computer to give away to someone computer illiterate, and want things to be as easy as possible for them.
[06:29] <strabes> CotRo|eR: yeah you're going to have to use samba if you want it on 2 different pcs
[06:30] <DanaG> that's the one -- 'networking'
[06:30] <nolimitsoya_> CotRo|eR, if you want to share on a dual boot system, try ext2ifs from www.fs-driver.org for reading ext2/3 from windows, and ntfs-3g for reading ntfs from ubuntu

[06:30] <CarCase928> why is the "alien package so dangerous?
[06:30] <DanaG> Though make sure you never have folders with spaces directly under /

[06:32] <Jonn`> hmm... I installed libntfs8 but it doesnt seems to work
[06:32] <CotRo|eR> btw I have ubuntu server (text mode) not gui
[06:32] <strabes> CotRo|eR: yeah i guess you could make a 100gig partition and share it over samba or something. I don't really know anything about samba cuz I have no need for it
[06:32] <CarCase928> !APT
[06:32] <ubotu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)

[06:34] <Jonn`> Well, how can I convert NTFS to... vFAT?
[06:34] <Jonn`> I dont want to lose the data
[06:34] <zdl> Hi! Anyone succeed installing the flexcam webcam from conceptronic?
[06:34] <tomix> yeha not in the mode for writing a load of scripts and im pretty fed up with sbackup
[06:34] <Spacelvis> CotRo|eR: when you install samba, you get a file called /etc/samba/smb.conf; in that one you decide what directories to share.
[06:34] <strabes> Jonn`: you'll have to back it up first, and then format the drive as vfat
[06:34] <DanaG> well, for remote backup, I've heard the term 'bacula' thrown around.
[06:34] <CarCase928> i have that, but my broadband internet modem broke down, and i'm stuck with dial-up, and i have many computers in my house, and i would like to use linux instead of windows to share my net connection
[06:34] <DanaG> it's a networked backup utility of some sort.  I haven't tried it.
[06:34] <strabes> Jonn`: you can't "convert " drives without formatting them
[06:35] <Jonn`> T_T
[06:35] <Spacelvis> CotRo|eR: so you don't need specific partitions, just mounted directories.
[06:35] <Invisible_> http://rafb.net/paste/results/40ECF242.html this is what i have in my /etc/network/interfaces
[06:35] <Zodiac`> i cant connect to internet with eth1 (Wireless) without giving Ubuntu my ESSID :/
[06:35] <minnmass> un_operateur: any ideas?
[06:35] <Zodiac`> but yesterday i could connect without ESSID
[06:35] <sig> Jonn`: do a backup of all your stuff and then reformat it
[06:35] <tomix> well take a closer look seems to be more for handling a network of computers rather than single workstation
[06:35] <CotRo|eR> tnx Spacelvis, I will try it :D
[06:35] <Zodiac`> someone know how to find ESSID? Or how to fix this shit?
[06:35] <strabes> Jonn`: are you trying to share a drive between windows & linux on the same pc? if so you can use fs-driver.org for reading/writing ext3 in windows and ntfs-3g for reading/writing ntfs in linux
[06:35] <Spacelvis> nice!
[06:35] <Jonn`> ok, brb I will make a folder for the files meanwhile
[06:35] <DanaG> Or if you have half the hard drive space free, you can resize the partition,
[06:35] <DanaG> make a new partition,
[06:35] <CarCase928> !ICS
[06:35] <DanaG> move the stuff,
[06:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ICS - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:35] <zspada15_> Zodiac`: its your routers thing
[06:36] <Invisible_> when i do /etc/init.d/networking restart it says can not access file /etc/network/interfaces linemissplaced:6:
[06:36] <Jonn`> No, what I want is to write in the external HDD
[06:36] <zspada15_> !language | Zodiac`
[06:36] <CarCase928> !Internet Connection Sharing
[06:36] <ubotu> Zodiac`: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[06:36] <Invisible_> what may be the problem?
[06:36] <DanaG> delete the old partiton and create a new one of the new type,
[06:36] <DanaG> then copy the stuff back, delete the temp partition, and resize the new one.
[06:36] <Zodiac`> shit aint bad <.<
[06:36] <minnmass> Jonn`: buy an external drive, copy everything to that, reformat the existing drive, and copy everything back.  It's the easiest way, really.  Plus, you have an external drive to which you can backup data.
[06:36] <CarCase928> !Internet Connection Sharing
[06:36] <Jonn`> what I want is to write files in the external HDD
[06:36] <Zodiac`> zspada15_, why did it work yesterday, but not now?
[06:36] <strabes> Jonn`: and the external is ntfs right now? if you take the external places then i would recommend you convert it to vfat so that other windows pcs can read it
[06:36] <DanaG> Oh, anything in /etc/init.d has to be sudo'd
[06:36] <Jonn`> minnmass: I only use Ubuntu in my laptop =)
[06:36] <zspada15_> Zodiac`: what chipset do you have?
[06:36] <strabes> Jonn`: or you could install ntfs-3g in linux to get read/write support of ntfs in linux
[06:37] <strabes> Jonn`: the latter requiring less work
[06:37] <Jonn`> alrighty
[06:37] <Zodiac`> Intel pro wireless 1000g or something
[06:37] <CotRo|eR> I'm getting this when i try to install samba :
[06:37] <CotRo|eR> Media change: please insert the disc labeled
[06:37] <CotRo|eR> 'Ubuntu-Server 6.10 _Edgy Eft_ - Release i386 (20061025.1)'
[06:37] <CotRo|eR> in the drive '/cdrom/' and press enter
[06:37] <cmt^^> what's a good dc++-client? (not linuxdc++)
[06:37] <zspada15_> Zodiac`: open up a terminal and type "lspci | grep intel"
[06:37] <Gibbste2> Ubuntu thinks my wireless adapter is wired. Anyone know how to fix that?
[06:38] <DanaG> perhaps the numbering is backwards.
[06:38] <Invisible_> anyhelp for me?
[06:38] <DanaG> If you go to the regular Gnome network thingy, what does it show?
[06:38] <nolimitsoya_> Jonn`, be aware that writing with ntfs-3g is reasonably well tested, but still experimental. especialy on other platforms than 386
[06:38] <Zodiac`> zspada15_, what should happend?
[06:38] <strabes> Gibbste2: what does network-admin say
[06:38] <zspada15_> Zodiac`: it should have displayed a line with your wireless card, paste ONLY THAT LINE into the chat
[06:39] <dv5237> anyone here got second life running on ubuntu?
[06:39] <nolimitsoya_> Jonn`, my suggestion would be having ext2ifs from www.fs-driver.org on a memorystick, for installation on windows pc:s you might visit, and using ext3 on your external drive
[06:39] <Zodiac`> zspada15_, kk
[06:39] <Zodiac`> someone know how to find ESSID? Or how to fix this shit?
[06:39] <minnmass> CotRo|eR: it seems you need to remove the CD from the install repos.  In advanced "add/remove software", you can change those.  Or, you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list directly: put at "#" in front of the CD repos.
[06:39] <Zodiac`> lawl wrong paste
[06:39] <Zodiac`> soz
[06:39] <PriceChild> !language | Zodiac`
[06:39] <ubotu> Zodiac`: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[06:39] <jrib> CotRo|eR: you have the cdrom repository in your sources.list, disable it
[06:39] <Zodiac`>  Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connect
[06:39] <CotRo|eR> tnx ppl
[06:39] <Jonn`> I will try with the ntfs-3g first, I only want to move one folder..
[06:39] <Zodiac`> thats my card.. zspada15_
[06:39] <strabes> nolimitsoya_: it's on an external HDD so he'll probably have to be able to r/w on other windows pcs
[06:39] <jrib> CotRo|eR: you can use the edit menu in system > administration > synaptic to edit your sources.list by the way
[06:39] <zspada15_> Zodiac`: by any chance is this a dell inspiron B130?
[06:40] <Jonn`> that's the name of the library, no? ntfs-3g ?
[06:40] <Gibbste2> strabes: it lists eth0 (wired) eth1(wired), modem connection
[06:40] <nolimitsoya_> strabes, hence the memorystick with ext2ifs, as i said, for windows pc:s to be visited ;)
[06:40] <Zodiac`> zspada15_, HP Pavilion dv1000
[06:40] <strabes> Jonn`: sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
[06:40] <DanaG> I pity the foo' (dang, so overused....) who uses ntfs-3G on a non-Windows-installed PC's internal drive.
[06:40] <Gibbste2> strabes: of course, I only have 1 wired connection, and 1 wireless connection
[06:40] <Jonn`> it's just that I had problems earlier with that
[06:40] <Invisible_> http://rafb.net/paste/results/40ECF242.html this is what i have in my /etc/network/interfaces file
[06:40] <lmosher> Can someone help met set up network-manager? I've just rebooted after doing "sudo install network-manager network manager-gnome" and that's it. On the network-manager website it says it will show all the wireless networks - it's not....
[06:40] <strabes> Gibbste2: that's correct then. eth1 is wireless and eth0 is wired
[06:40] <strabes> generally
[06:40] <nolimitsoya_> Jonn`, what sort of problems?
[06:40] <Gibbste2> strabes: (and 1 modem connection)
[06:41] <strabes> Gibbste2: yeah
[06:41] <Gibbste2> strabes: well, why does it list the wireless adapter as wired?
[06:41] <Jonn`> I heard it was libntfs-3g0
[06:41] <DanaG> eth1 is standard for ipw drivers.
[06:41] <strabes> Gibbste2: i dunno
[06:41] <Gibbste2> strabes: and how do I get it to do wireless type things
[06:41] <dfcarney> dist-upgrading to edgy completely hosed my system -- now, it won't even boot because it hangs at various init scripts.  Can one perform a "clean" install from CD?  I.e. I just care to preserve what's in my homedir, but it's all on the same partition...
[06:41] <Gibbste2> stabes: like scan for ESSIDs
[06:41] <dooglus> how do I stop a module being loaded at boot time in edgy?
[06:41] <strabes> Gibbste2: like what??
[06:41] <nolimitsoya_> Jonn`, apt-get ntfs-3g, and mount th partition with '-t ntfs-3g'
[06:42] <zspada15_> !ipw2200 | Zodiac`
[06:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ipw2200 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[06:42] <CarCase928> how do i exec alien?
[06:42] <DanaG> dfcarney: you can copy the home to somewhere else.  That's about it.
[06:42] <nolimitsoya_> CarCase928, 'alien <package>'
[06:42] <DanaG> Oh, and save any custom configs, like GDM or Xorg and such.
[06:42] <minnmass> CotRo|eR: Yes.  The "cdrom" part...
[06:42] <DanaG> And sources.list
[06:42] <noobie> hi does anyone knows why my ubuntu no longer detects my ps/2 keyboard?
[06:42] <strabes> Gibbste2: sudo apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome && sudo ifconfig eth1 up
[06:42] <Jonn`> well, looks like I lack of repositories or something... it cant find the package
[06:42] <CarCase928> nolimitsoya_: thanks
[06:42] <DanaG> !ntfs-3g
[06:42] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution.

[06:42] <darkrider01> lmosher: i have/had the same problem with the network manager, however it still doesn't show any networks but i managed to set up my wireless with the use of iwconfig etc.

[06:43] <nolimitsoya_> belter, have you tried checking the xorg.conf?
[06:43] <nolimitsoya_> CarCase928, be aware that that command willinstall the rpm directly. mine will convert it to a deb

[06:44] <zodiac__> why is there no ESSID to choose in the dropdown-menu in wireless network settings?
[06:44] <lmosher> darkrider01, My wireless network is working fine, but it's really annoying to have to log into root to switch networks when I go from work to home.
[06:44] <jrib> Ignite_: system > administration > language
[06:44] <nolimitsoya_> hikenboot, tried hubackup?
[06:44] <strabes> CarCase928: yeah if you want it to convert to a .deb first, remove the -i flag and it'll put a .deb in your home dir
[06:44] <hikenboot> thanks nolimitsoya_
[06:44] <DanaG> Is your SSID set to not broadcast?

[06:55] <dooglus> how can I stop a module from being loaded when I boot edgy?  adding 'blacklist bcm43xx' to /etc/modprobe.d/myblacklist didn't do it
[06:56] <Gibbste2> maybe I'll try again next version.
[06:56] <metho> zspada15_: yes it is pcmcia and ubuntu sees but unable to do anything to do

[06:57] <lmosher> DanaG, Doesn't look like I'll get help there (it doesn't appear active). Could it be because I installed BOTH network-manager and network-manager-gnome? Or would that be required?

[06:57] <CotRo|eR> does anyone know what that is???
[06:57] <metho> zspada15_: gona check out the guide but i am not sure ndiswrapper cos ubuntu already sees my card
[06:57] <DanaG> Network-Manager is the daemon, the -gnome is the applet.
[06:57] <EminNew> topic
[06:58] <nolimitsoya> skreet, i get nothing of the top of my head, but checkultimate boot cd :) there should be some toll that can recover partitions on there, if not, google is your friend :)
[06:58] <nolimitsoya> *tool
[06:58] <lmosher> DanaG, ah, ok then that answers that.
[06:58] <lmosher> DanaG, How do I start the daemon specifically?
[06:58] <skreet> nolimitsoya: I actually have a UBCD, I'll try that.. was hoping it was a common easy problem :(
[06:58] <DanaG> I believe it starts at boot.
[06:58] <m0dY> in what file the last kernel panic log is saved ?
[06:58] <skreet> nolimitsoya: Tempted just to recreate the partition :P
[06:58] <DanaG> Oh, wait, somebody mention UBCD?
[06:58] <CarCase928> what is the command for deleting a file/folder with a picture of a lock above it? it was put onj my desktop when i attempt to install a package with "alien".
[06:59] <un_operateur> Errm, Dana -- i think you meant networking is the daemon and network-manager is a package/applet ??
[06:59] <DanaG> The utility you may be looking for is TestDisk
[06:59] <CarCase928> on
[06:59] <ball> hello kmu
[06:59] <nolimitsoya> skreet, only do that if you can aford toloose the data, and if you can aford to loose the next set of data; you could be looking at a faulty drive
[06:59] <kmu> Hi ball
[06:59] <metho> DanaG: thanks mate, gona check this out
[06:59] <lmosher> DanaG, How do I make sure the network-manager thing is running (and not just the applet) I did reboot, but who knows maybe it didn't work.
[06:59] <m0dY> Any idea in what file the last kernel panic log is saved ?
[06:59] <DanaG> TestDisk has saved my as-------er, data---- so many times
[07:00] <skreet> nolimitsoya: Almost positive it's not a faulty drive. I think the machine was shut down improperly, and the partition was made last session.
[07:00] <DanaG> It even fixed a corrupt FAT.
[07:00] <CarCase928> !root
[07:00] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:00] <nolimitsoya> DanaG, make sure to highlight skreet so he knows :)
[07:00] <ball> !monkey
[07:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about monkey - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:00] <skreet> TestDisk? :)
[07:00] <skreet> googling.
[07:00] <CotRo|eR> http://pastebin.ca/285212 - can anyone help me with this ???
[07:00] <DanaG> Yeah.  There's an ubuntu package for testdisk.
[07:00] <skreet> Can you run from os or do you need to boot?
[07:00] <nolimitsoya> skreet, then is could be afaulty fs, and thats easier to fix. what fs is it?
[07:00] <skreet> ext3.
[07:01] <MarcN> nolimitsoya: the package smartmontools is handy to monitor the health of disks.  Add munin to the mix and keep graphical historical data
[07:01] <skreet> mke2fs -j /dev/sda1 = ext3, right?
[07:01] <nolimitsoya> MarcN, same to you, highlight skreet ;)
[07:01] <rak> hey, i'm making a computer illiterate family a ubuntu machine and i wantd to make it as easy to use and un-breakable as possible, i already made launcher bars and hid a lot of the stuff they won't need and made it auto-login, does anyone else have any tips?
[07:01] <DanaG> rak: Adblock Plus for Firefox!
[07:01] <ball> rak: blackbox is your friend ;-)
[07:01] <skreet> MarcN: Saw your comment. Thanks.
[07:01] <skreet> running testdisk now.
[07:02] <Captain_Redbeard> I could use a little help tweaking xorg.conf to work with my twinview setup... I want to be able to put the desktop on my TV aswell as on my CRT-monitor... but whenever I add what I think is right, nothing works not even the monitor...
[07:02] <DanaG> TestDisk is rather unintuitive at first.
[07:02] <skreet> DanaG: Can I run testdisk from sda3 on sda1 safely do you know?
[07:02] <CotRo|eR> Hey guys I have a problem when updating ubuntu: http://pastebin.ca/285212 - any help pls?
[07:02] <rak> good idea on adblock,
[07:02] <m0dY> Any idea in what file the last kernel panic log is saved ?
[07:02] <rak> ball:what's blackbox?
[07:02] <DanaG> the "plus" is completely different.
[07:02] <clearscreen> it's a window manager
[07:02] <clearscreen> very simplistic
[07:02] <ball> rak: a beautifully minimal window manager that's easy to configure
[07:02] <ball> (you configure it and they don't have to ;-)
[07:02] <DanaG> I have used TestDisk on a different partition that's on the same drive.
[07:02] <CotRo|eR> Hey guys I have a problem when updating ubuntu: http://pastebin.ca/285212 - any help pls?
[07:03] <skreet> Good to know, playing with it now
[07:03] <DanaG> Just make sure to unmount the partition you're dealing with.
[07:03] <CarCase928> how do i log into the root account?
[07:03] <DanaG> And don't write until you've figured out the interface.
[07:03] <nolimitsoya> rak, id suggest using fluxbox instead of blackbox. the same, plus some functionality
[07:03] <hikenboot> nolimitsoya_, will hubackup split files it backed up the folder that contained the files but it didnt backup the files?
[07:03] <nolimitsoya> !root | CarCase928
[07:03] <ubotu> CarCase928: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:03] <skreet> Locating backup ext2/3 superblock.. sounds helpful.
[07:03] <DanaG> oops, need a >, not a |
[07:04] <skreet> superblock not unlike a FAT?
[07:04] <nolimitsoya> hikenboot, punctuate please. i cant make that sentence make any sense
[07:04] <DanaG> for sending messages.  (random off-topic)
[07:04] <CarCase928> what is the command for deleting folders/files?
[07:04] <skreet> CarCase928: rm
[07:04] <zoredache> I have a simple question.  Does anyone know of a utility to disable an existing account by setting it's password to '*' in the shadow file?
[07:04] <nolimitsoya> CarCase928, rm and rmdir
[07:04] <CarCase928> skreet: thanks
[07:04] <skreet> CarCase928: Do yourself a favor and man rm to learn what *not* to do.
[07:04] <michi> oder rm -r for folders
[07:04] <CarCase928> ok, thanks
[07:04] <hikenboot> sorry ....I backed up a folder that contained files that are 4 gig in size...it ran the backup but didnt backup any of the files just the folder...is there a way to tell it to backup large files?
[07:05] <FunnyLookinHat> zoredache, System - Administration - Users and Groups     ??
[07:05] <skreet> be careful with the -f flag, or using rm as root, one char can ruin everything.. trust me :(
[07:05] <sandro__> hello
[07:05] <CotRo|eR> Hey guys I have a problem when updating ubuntu: http://pastebin.ca/285212 - any help pls?
[07:05] <zoredache> FunnyLookinHat, I am trying to write a bash script... I wish to be able to disable an account.  The GUI doesn't do it for me in this case...
[07:05] <nolimitsoya> hikenboot, i have no clue since i dont use it :) i use tar, rsync and anacron to do my backups. :)
[07:06] <x-r00t-x> !fsck
[07:06] <ubotu> fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[07:06] <dooglus> doh!  the answer to my question "how do you stop a module from loading when you boot" is "REMOVE it from /etc/modules"!!!
[07:06] <dooglus> silly me.
=== cloom is now known as clommichmuch
[07:06] <hikenboot> well thanks and have a great set of holidays
[07:06] <x-r00t-x> !bootsplash
[07:06] <CotRo|eR> Hey guys I have a problem when updating ubuntu: http://pastebin.ca/285212
[07:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bootsplash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:07] <DanaG> !fbsplash
[07:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fbsplash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:07] <FunnyLookinHat> zoredache, oohh...  well do you want to just disable it or remove it competely?  because the console command would be userdel
[07:07] <DanaG> is not in Ubuntu :(
[07:07] <x-r00t-x> hi LjL :)
[07:07] <klip> Hmmm, does anyone know the syntax of bash? I'd like to pass two arguments to a function.
[07:07] <nolimitsoya> CotRo|eR, did you by any chance use automatix once in the past?
[07:07] <klip> "foobar $1" works with one argument
[07:07] <skreet> DanaG: hmm..
[07:07] <skreet> DanaG: I did analyze on sda
[07:07] <FunnyLookinHat> zoredache, and i believe any modifying of the account (disabling perhaps) can be done with the usermod command...   try googling "usermod tutorial"
[07:07] <CarCase928> what is the command for deleting a directory? the "rm" command does not delete directories.
[07:07] <klip> but "foobar $1 $2" does not.
[07:07] <skreet> DanaG: Showing 4 partitions, but (c)fdisk only shows 3.
[07:07] <LjL> hi
[07:07] <michi> rm -r
[07:08] <klip> rmdir removes directories.
[07:08] <CotRo|eR> nolimitsoya: i dont know what automatix is ..
[07:08] <zoredache> FunnyLookinHat, I don't want to delete the account, just set the password field in 'shadow' to '*'... like all the other service accounts...
[07:08] <DanaG> well, sometimes one will be a deleted version of an existing partition.
[07:08] <nolimitsoya> klip, you can use && to execute consecutive commands, other than that, its the manpages :)
[07:08] <FunnyLookinHat> zoredache, actually, usermod --lock username    would disable an account
[07:08] <CarCase928> thanks
[07:08] <zoredache> Ah, usermod, I'll check that.
[07:08] <FunnyLookinHat> zoredache, and similiarly,     usermod --unlock username     would unlock it   : )
[07:08] <nolimitsoya> CotRo|eR, try 'sudo apt-get -f install'
[07:08] <DanaG> And it helps to launch, then save, then scan, then load, then check everything.
[07:09] <DanaG> Including undeleting (uses arrow keys)
[07:09] <klip> nolimitsoya, thanks, but I am writing a bashscript myself, and I need to know how to give two parameters to a function ;)
[07:09] <skreet> DanaG: Well the one that isn't on cfdisk but is in testdisk would be about the size of what i'm seeing
[07:09] <CotRo|eR> tnx ill try it soon
[07:09] <DanaG> aah, then that's the deleted one.
[07:09] <skreet> NICE!
[07:09] <CraZyLeGs> what's key(s) to press to have underscore( _ ) ? my keyboard layout has changed in ubuntu
[07:09] <skreet> If I do 'list files'
[07:09] <DanaG> You can also list files.
[07:09] <skreet> yes
[07:09] <skreet> it sees everything i'm missing
[07:10] <skreet> so now i have to figure out why my parititon tables are mapped wrong, without damaging
[07:10] <CraZyLeGs> it's on belgian french or something
[07:10] <DanaG> That utility has saved me so many times -- two times were when XP install decided my 3 partitions were one.
[07:10] <zoredache> FunnyLookinHat, thanks, "usermod -p * username" does what I want.
[07:10] <DanaG> And I mistakenly formatted that one.
[07:10] <nolimitsoya> skreet, mount -ro while fiddling around with mountoptions
[07:10] <DanaG> Yet I lost no data, thanks to TestDisk.
[07:11] <FunnyLookinHat> zoredache, cool beans
[07:11] <kane77> hi
[07:11] <skreet> nolimitsoya: Thanks.
[07:11] <kane77> what do you think of gnome?
[07:11] <un_operateur> CraZyLeGs, at a terminal -- gnome-keyboard-properties
[07:12] <mzanfardino> is there a way to store my ubuntu cd as an ISO on my system and make reference to it in /etc/apt/sources.list so that when performing an apt-get install which calls for the CD I don't have to actually have the CD?
[07:12] <Gosha> what do i need to play midi files?
[07:12] <DanaG> TestDisk doesn't do anything to the disk until you tell it you're sure you want to write.
[07:12] <nolimitsoya> kane77, inferior to xfce in my opinion, but superb for most users, and much more stable than kde
[07:12] <klip> kane77, GNOME is great. Like it far more than KDE. Not that big and blue ;)
[07:12] <EminNew> CraZyLegs, can you change it in System->Preferences->Keyboard
[07:12] <un_operateur> mzanfardino, sure -- you'll need to do a little googling to add a file://location to sources.list
[07:13] <kane77> klip, yeah I like it too... kde has a bit more eyecandy.. but I dont need that :D
[07:13] <nolimitsoya> is there any way to have the applications menu come up on rightclick desktop i gnome?
[07:13] <un_operateur> mzanfardino, but rather than store the CD as an image .. you just copy the CD into a new folder
[07:13] <mzanfardino> un_operateur: I have space concerns, atm
[07:14] <mzanfardino> the ISO would be preferred from a space limitation perspective
[07:14] <Gosha> ... >_<
=== Gosha is now known as Gosha|Away
[07:14] <un_operateur> mzanfardino, an ISO does no compression eh .. so either way, you take up the same space
[07:14] <Captain_Redbeard> I need a hand with getting my Nvidia card to output on my TV. My xorg.conf should be ok, but the logs reports that the xserver can't "map to" any second device...
[07:15] <lmosher> I think something (in general) is wrong w/ my wireless connection. In Dapper when I was entering my ESSID in the default app it would give me a list of ESSID's. In Edgy I have to type the ESSID manually - is this supposed to be the case, or is this a problem? This may be the reason network-manager won't work. I didn't do a fresh install of Edgy but instead did an upgrade from Dapper.
[07:15] <mzanfardino> un_operateur: really? I'd thought the ISO was smaller than the sum of the whoel.
[07:15] <nolimitsoya> !tvout | Captain_Redbeard
[07:15] <ubotu> Captain_Redbeard: For help with enabling the TV-Out on certain NVidia cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaTVOutNewbieEdition
[07:15] <grazie> Where are synaptic log files stored?
[07:15] <un_operateur> mzanfardino, if space is a concern -- why dont you just add your CD rom to sources.list ??
[07:16] <un_operateur> mzanfardino, no, no compression
[07:16] <un_operateur> grazie, /var/lib/dpkg  probably
[07:17] <grazie> un_operateur: thanks I'll look there
[07:17] <mzanfardino> un_operateur: how about this: I place the CD on my network somewhere and point sources.list to it.  If I do this, the next question is houw
[07:17] <mzanfardino> *how
[07:17] <mzanfardino> !sources.list
[07:17] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[07:17] <jkimball4> Why, when I use sudo would i receive an error such as "cannot execute binary file"?
[07:17] <rjg__> Would anyone know of a skinnable nautilus replacement, on a way of making one a program a diffent beryl theme and GTK theme??
[07:17] <mzanfardino> !EasySource
[07:17] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[07:17] <lmosher> I did an update from Dapper.  3 packages were held back: gkrellm, libggi2 and mplayer. How do I repair this?
[07:17] <CraZyLeGs> thanks
[07:17] <nolimitsoya> !msgthebot | mzanfardino
[07:17] <ubotu> mzanfardino: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops...
[07:18] <jkimball4> lmosher: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[07:18] <nolimitsoya> lmosher, try aptitude
[07:18] <un_operateur> mzanfardino, sure, you can do that -- although you need a functional WWW/FTP server and apt-mirror (i think)
[07:18] <skreet> DanaG: Looks like it repaired the table correctly, gotta reboot to find out, THANK YOU FOR THE POINTER!!!
[07:18] <strusmb> cze! mam prosbe: ktos mi moze wytlumaczec czym jest ubuntu?
[07:18] <skreet> Wish me luck!
[07:18] <un_operateur> mzanfardino, but its way simpler just to  -- pop in the CD -- and do a -- sudo apt-cdrom
[07:18] <nolimitsoya> !cz | strusmb
[07:18] <ubotu> strusmb: esk uivatele dme, aby mluvili v kanle #ubuntu anglicky. esky je mono se domluvit v #ubuntu-cz. Dkujeme.
[07:18] <lmosher> jkimball4, When I type that it just says "The following packages will be kept back:"
[07:18] <strusmb> czym jest ubuntu? nie ksam klimatu
[07:18] <mzanfardino> un_operateur: hmmm... well, maybe I'll stick to just leaving it on the CD.
[07:19] <DanaG> Now just remember the name of that utility, and the fact that Ultimate Boot CD has it too.
[07:19] <EminNew> Is there a simple way to restore my sound drivers? Worked fine after Ubuntu install, but I felt brave and messed with them.
[07:19] <DanaG> Share the joy of UBCD!
[07:19] <skreet> UBCD for all!
[07:19] <naylor> un_operateur, hi it went horribly wrong and now i can't install the old fspot
[07:19] <Music_Shuffle> You can...recognize Czech nolimitsoya ? Nice.
[07:19] <naylor> un_operateur, is there a command to downgrade packages to the original edgy version
[07:19] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle, no i cant :P i took a guess :)
[07:19] <naylor> un_operateur, http://pastebin.ca/285220
[07:20] <Music_Shuffle> Hahahahaha. In that case, guessing skills ftw. ;)
[07:20] <lmosher> typing sudo apt-get dist-upgrade is holding packages back, how do I fix this?
[07:20] <DanaG> use aptitude.
[07:20] <mzanfardino> ok, one more question: say I've installed Edgy from CD, but don't have the CD available.  Now I'm installing something that requires the CD... is there a source I can point to that will take the place of the local cd?
[07:20] <minnmass> aptitude and apt-get are dying on errors with coreutils.  How do I fix this?
[07:21] <Music_Shuffle> mzanfardino, what requires the CD post-install?
[07:21] <naylor> does anyone know of any commands to repair your system, i can't install f-spot becuase i upgraded a load of packages to feisty versions, ubuntu wouldn't boot so i did "apt-get update -f" which removed a load of things, now it boots but i get this when try to put fspot in: http://pastebin.ca/285220
[07:21] <nolimitsoya> minnmass, stand up straight, wiggle your arms and do a backflip ;)
[07:21] <minnmass> nolimitsoya: I tried that; all I got was a mild concussion.
[07:21] <mzanfardino> Music_Shuffle: I'm attempting to install tshark on my Edgy server and it's requiring the CD.
[07:22] <Music_Shuffle> Oh. Interesting.
[07:22] <un_operateur> naylor, from what i can see -- thats not a problem -- you simply havent installed the packages for f-spot's depends ..
[07:22] <Music_Shuffle> I've...never mucked with that before, I just thought the CD was never necessary post-install.
[07:22] <nolimitsoya> naylor, feisty support is in #ubuntu+1, and feisty is alpha. third, downgrading is not a imple matter...
[07:22] <nolimitsoya> *simple
[07:22] <Faggoreau> anyone here use Litestep? i cant figure out how to get to the console window to do !Bang commands
[07:22] <un_operateur> naylor,  sudo aptitude install -f    ought to help you clean up if you want to revert
[07:22] <naylor> nolimitsoya, i'm not running feisty i am on edgy
[07:22] <mzanfardino> Music_Shuffle: more intersting is that a CD wasn't required when I installed the GUI version on my Ubuntu desktop
[07:23] <skreet> DanaG: Yay!
[07:23] <Lunar_Lamp> I have a (minor) weird problem.  When I type "hostname" on the command line I get told the hostname of my box, however, my router just gives me a blank and doesn't seem to be detecting it... Anyone have any ideas?
[07:23] <skreet> Thanks again, it worked.
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> naylor, you just installed random packages without a systemwide upgrade? thats bound to break in more ways than one...
[07:23] <Lunar_Lamp> Faggoreau, litestep is windows only isn't it?
[07:23] <mzanfardino> Music_Shuffle: and since they are both running as VM's under windows (nevermind why), I was trying to reduce the frequency of CD changes...
[07:24] <Faggoreau> idk
[07:24] <naylor> un_operateur, it won't let me go back!! argh
[07:24] <skreet> Lunar_Lamp: I believe it is too.
[07:24] <terje> what's up with http://packages.freecontrib.org/ 404's ?
[07:24] <DanaG> Lunar_Lamp: look in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[07:24] <x-r00t-x> can anyone help me to change my bootsplash?
[07:24] <DanaG> you need the "send host-name" line.
[07:24] <un_operateur> naylor, have you tried aptitude install -f?
[07:24] <nolimitsoya> !usplash | x-r00t-x

[07:24] <metho> DanaG: i have been following the guide which i was directed by u, i am getting errors which i can not solve due to my lack of knowldge, now i want to show u what errors i am getting but i think i am not allowing copy and paste here so i was wondering how could i show you the errors for suggestions
[07:24] <Lunar_Lamp> Faggoreau, you might be best off trying a non-ubuntu channel for litestep help :-)
[07:24] <naylor> nolimitsoya, i was updating packages dependent to run fspot 0.3 instead of 0.2 but now it won't let me install what i had
[07:24] <naylor> un_operateur, yes, done that already, it removed a load of things and now it won't install f-spot
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> naylor, try 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install <package>'
[07:25] <CotRo|eR> nolimitsoya: :| still doesn't work
[07:25] <un_operateur> Lunar_Lamp, your router might not be able to detect your Linux box's hostname because there is no name server on the network that your host is registered to -
[07:25] <Lunar_Lamp> <DanaG> Lunar_Lamp: look in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf <== for what?!
[07:25] <mzanfardino> metho: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[07:25] <metho> thanks
[07:25] <DanaG> 'send host-name "whatever"   '
[07:25] <DanaG> uncomment it and edit it.
[07:25] <un_operateur> Lunar_Lamp, router's pick up windows boxes names via NetBIOS which is something Linux doesnt do natively
[07:25] <naylor> no it won't work, i get this: http://pastebin.ca/285225
[07:25] <mzanfardino> metho: once you paste, just paste the link back in... no spam
[07:25] <Lunar_Lamp> un_operateur, ah, right. So either I run my laptop as a "name server" or I just forget about it?
[07:25] <CotRo|eR> nolimitsoya: what is the problem? http://pastebin.ca/285212
[07:26] <naylor> nolimitsoya, http://pastebin.ca/285225
[07:26] <nolimitsoya> CotRo|eR, i cant even remember what your problem was in the first place. this channel holds ~1000ppl, so when reviving a long (>15min) dead issue, give me a hint
[07:26] <naylor> un_operateur, http://pastebin.ca/285225
[07:26] <un_operateur> Lunar_Lamp, I dont really know if your router will resolve via DNS .. you have to try it out
[07:26] <metho> ok mate
[07:26] <DanaG> I have that same issue.
[07:26] <metho> DanaG and others who are willing to help me, here is the link.. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37942/
[07:26] <Lunar_Lamp> un_operateur, ok, thanks. It's more than a 2min fix so I can't be bothered to fix it for the 2weeks I am here :-)
[07:27] <Invisible_> nolimitsoya> i just finished installing ubuntu server, i want to run it as a NAT/Mail server
[07:27] <Invisible_> any suggestions ?
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> naylor, id say just reinstall... youve probably broken tons of stuff

[07:27] <LjL> x-r00t-x, usplash *is* the boot splash screen
[07:27] <minnmass> Seriously, though; any suggestions as to where to go for help w/ apt?
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> Invisible_, not realy :) shorewall will set you up on the nat side, but i have no clue as of mail
[07:27] <EminNew> Uh... alsa intel8x0 drivers... tried manual install... now they don't work. Hm, help?

[07:28] <CotRo|eR> :/
[07:28] <un_operateur> naylor, you'll have to individually install all those depends -- mono-runtime, libgtk2.0-cil, etc
[07:28] <Jonn`> lol I surrender, Im going to reformat it
[07:28] <Gosha> .. what do i need for playback of midi files?
[07:28] <naylor> un_operateur, what can i do? i don't wanna reinstall all again
[07:28] <LjL> !midi | Gosha
[07:28] <ubotu> Gosha: Trouble playing MIDI files? Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MidiSoftwareSynthesisHowTo
[07:29] <Gosha> domo
[07:29] <naylor> un_operateur, it won't let me install them though
[07:29] <DanaG> metho: make sure the bcm-whatever driver is not loaded.
[07:29] <DanaG> modprobe -r it.
[07:29] <metho> ok
[07:30] <DanaG> oh, and there's ndiswrapper -l
[07:30] <DanaG> (lowercase L)
[07:30] <un_operateur> naylor, have you tried something like this -- sudo aptitude install mono-runtime libmono1.0-cil  libgtk2.0-cil libglib2.0-cil libmono-sqlite1.0-cil
[07:30] <metho> DanaG: i have used the modprobe -r command, now could u please tell me where i should start that guide from???
[07:30] <DanaG> modprobe -v ndiswrapper
[07:30] <DanaG> (v is for verbose)
[07:31] <DanaG> and then look in dmesg
[07:31] <naylor> un_operateur, cool that's doing something
[07:31] <mc44> DanaG: need a sudo there too :)
[07:31] <eyalw> hi mates
[07:31] <un_operateur> naylor, do you see what i just did there -?? just installing the components that the other command failed on
[07:32] <eyalw> one Q, good command line utility for converting videos formats and other properties
[07:32] <pitillo> hi good afternoon, ubuntu's precompilded kernel image has automount modules installed? Is there a way to don't load some of them? There are a lot loaded by default.
[07:32] <metho> DanaG: now i have completely lost it, i dont know what i am doing,
[07:32] <DanaG> hmm, there are 3 packages for ndiswrapper
=== PriceChild is now known as PriceChild_
[07:32] <DanaG> ndiswrapper-utils ndiswrapper-utils-1.1 ndiswrapper-utils-1.8
=== PriceChild_ is now known as PriceChild
[07:33] <DanaG> you may need the latter -- 1.8.

[07:34] <unimatrix9> has any one tested or used lindvd?
[07:34] <metho> danaG i have installed those 3 packages for ndiswrapper
[07:34] <eyalw> one Q, good command line utility for converting videos formats and other properties???
[07:34] <isai> hi
[07:34] <mc44> metho: you need to use sudo
[07:34] <DanaG> I see 3. Installed drivers: 4. bcmwl5a invalid driver!
[07:34] <isai> I need to know which package holds 'mysql.h'.
[07:34] <b1f30_w0rk> eyalw: mencoder
[07:34] <unimatrix9> eyalw mencoder
[07:34] <metho> mc44: sudo?
[07:34] <DanaG> eyalw: avidemux
[07:34] <eyalw> ok, thanks
[07:34] <Music_Shuffle> !sudo | metho
[07:34] <ubotu> metho: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:34] <DanaG> though you may need a newer version.
[07:35] <mc44> metho: ie. sudo modprobe -v ndiswrapper
[07:35] <naylor> un_operateur, cool that's working thanks, i got well panicked!! haha
[07:35] <isai> All I see is a bunch of libmysqlclientXX pkgs where XX is some aritrary number.
[07:35] <un_operateur> isai, probably mysql or mysql-server source
[07:35] <DanaG> metho is already in sudo -i mode.
[07:35] <DanaG> so sudo again is redundant.
[07:35] <EminNew> quit off to the forums
[07:35] <EminNew> darn it
[07:35] <mc44> DanaG: oh sorry
[07:36] <un_operateur> naylor, it's only natural the first time -- but relax -- its just linux -- it'll fight to stay alive so you can mess with it :)
[07:36] <metho> mc44: sudo didnt make any difference
[07:36] <mc44> metho: yes, my fault sorry
[07:37] <DanaG> metho: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/59983
[07:37] <isai> un_operateur, I already have those packages installed and have a mysql db running, I just need the mysql.h to for my c program
[07:37] <kyeyekkarn> What's the difference between the Edgy livecd and liveDVD? (particularly for installing)
[07:38] <alecjw> hi. what software do people recommend for cd labelling?
[07:38] <nolimitsoya> kyeyekkarn, the dvd contains all of the most popular packages on disc for netless setup
[07:38] <kyeyekkarn> nolimitsoya, Where can I get that?
[07:38] <metho> DanaG does this mean, it is not gona work
[07:38] <nolimitsoya> kyeyekkarn, get what?
[07:38] <DanaG> metho: you may need to redo the 'add driver' thingy.
[07:38] <DanaG> with 1.8 specifically.
[07:39] <nolimitsoya> kyeyekkarn, do you mean its not downloadable?
[07:39] <kyeyekkarn> nolimitsoya, the like DVD. on the main ubuntu download page it only seems to show CD releases..
[07:39] <kyeyekkarn> like=live
[07:39] <metho> DanaG: will do that
[07:39] <nolimitsoya> kyeyekkarn, buy a dvd :)
[07:39] <FifaFrazer> When i integrate x^-1 with maxima the result is log x, but shouldn't it be ln x ?
[07:39] <kyeyekkarn> nolimitsoya, my wireless connection requires that I visit a website in order to login. Will it be possible to install with the CD and still get other applications?
[07:39] <alecjw> kyeyekkarn: they're hiding the dvd's fo edgy (dunno why) try countrycode.cdimage.ubuntu.com
[07:40] <DanaG> kyeyekkarn: does it use SSL?
[07:40] <erchache> hi
[07:40] <nolimitsoya> kyeyekkarn, yes, read up on apt if you want to know how software is handled in ubuntu :)
[07:40] <nolimitsoya> !apt | kyeyekkarn

[07:40] <erchache> im trying to install ubuntu edgy amd64 on a hp dl360 G5
[07:40] <DanaG> The version of Links on Ubuntu doesn't support SSL.
[07:40] <erchache> and doesnt recognize NICS
[07:40] <DanaG> You'll have to use the LiveCD.
[07:40] <kyeyekkarn> DanaG, no idea. but if I don't type my username and password (I'm at a school) I can't use the connection
[07:40] <DanaG> Or DVD.
[07:41] <erchache> can i use DVD to install boot:server?
[07:41] <metho> DanaG: "ndiswrapper -i ~/windows_drivers/bcmwl5a.inf"  >>>will be "ndiswrapper --1.8 -i ~/windows_drivers/bcmwl5a.inf"
[07:41] <erchache> i think i need to recompile kernel and server version doesnt have kernel packages
[07:41] <sharp15> does anyone know where I can modify the host name? (shows up as <username>@<hostname> on the terminal windows.)
[07:41] <monika__> hello
[07:41] <DanaG> or perhaps ndiswrapper-1.8
[07:41] <DanaG> no space.
[07:41] <TurtleBoots> can anyone here advise how to install the driver for graphics card Please?
[07:41] <metho> cheeras
[07:41] <nolimitsoya> kyeyekkarn, there are dvd releases on the webpage for download if you just scroll down a bit :)
[07:41] <klip> TurtleBoots, nVidia or ATI?

[07:42] <francesco> hi. i'm trying to move /var to a new partition but even if i cp -a the old /var when i reboot i don't get /var/run and /var/lock mounted as shm. hints?
[07:42] <kyeyekkarn> nolimitsoya, Well they didn't have a US mirror...
[07:42] <un_operateur> isai, you there?
[07:43] <klip> TurtleBoots, newer than a GeForce2?
[07:43] <nolimitsoya> monika__, cant you just type the mount of the partition in the adress bar?
[07:43] <DanaG> francesco: edit the fstab.
[07:43] <klip> The driver depends on the age of the card ;)
[07:43] <CotRo|eR> how do i remotely access my ubuntu server (no gui) ?
[07:43] <TurtleBoots> klip: nVidia NV6 ?
[07:43] <alecjw> kyeyekkarn: nothing. have you heard of a symlink?
[07:43] <sharp15> CotRo|eR: ssh?
[07:43] <Music_Shuffle> CotRo|eR, SSH?
[07:43] <nolimitsoya> !nvidia | TurtleBoots

[07:43] <isai> un_operateur, yes
[07:43] <monika__> nolimitsoya: i can, but it doesn't work in amarok
[07:43] <nolimitsoya> klip, i think he means a gf6 class card :)
[07:43] <DanaG> the /var is its own line.

[07:44] <klip> TurtleBoots, Let's try the newer drivers first: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[07:44] <nolimitsoya> monika__, i dont use kde so i dont know if i can give any great tips on it, but cant you make a bookmank like in thunar?
[07:44] <francesco> DanaG: i'll pastebin the whole fstab, just a sec
[07:44] <alecjw> kyeyekkarn: well, a symlink to be preocise, but sothing tells me that you're a windows user :D
[07:44] <nolimitsoya> *bookmark
[07:44] <CotRo|eR> !ssh
[07:44] <monika__> nolimitsoya: want to see screen shot?

[07:44] <TurtleBoots> klip: Thankyou very much! :-D Trying...
[07:44] <klip> TurtleBoots, After the installation of the driver you need to enable it.
[07:44] <nolimitsoya> monika__, thank you, but i dont think theyll help in this matter :)
[07:45] <DanaG> wait, TurtleBoots
[07:45] <DanaG> do lspci | grep -i NV
[07:45] <isai> un_operateur, thank you.
[07:45] <LjL> when i plug in my USB MP3 player, X freezes (mouse moves, but no actions possible, including Ctrl+Alt+Backspace). commented /var/log/messages at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37945/
[07:45] <TurtleBoots> DanaG : to late :-/
[07:45] <klip> TurtleBoots, for Edgy: sudo nvidia-xconfig, for Dapper and older: sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[07:45] <unimatrix9> monika_ cant you make an new file and put the music there?
[07:45] <TurtleBoots> klip: sweetness!!!!
[07:45] <DanaG> It's just to see which NVIDIA driver you need -- old or new.
[07:45] <nolimitsoya> monika__, i suggest you either make bookmarks in konqi, or links i your home
[07:45] <unimatrix9> so you can find it?
[07:45] <monika__> hm
[07:45] <francesco> DanaG: http://rafb.net/paste/results/2IY4aL48.html
[07:45] <monika__> do you think that symlinks will help?
[07:45] <nolimitsoya> monika__, or run it by LjL, i think he/shes a kde user :)
[07:45] <unimatrix9> monika_ or run amarok as root?
[07:45] <klip> TurtleBoots, After that, you need to restart the PC; an nvidia-screen will welcome you before GDM starts. That means it was successful.
[07:45] <TurtleBoots> DanaG: have you any idea???
[07:46] <sharp15> CotRo|eR: this help? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AdvancedOpenSSH
[07:46] <monika__> unimatrix9: i have permissions to access this
[07:46] <nolimitsoya> unimatrix9, monika__, thatd be _very_ unwize
[07:46] <unimatrix9> ah ok
[07:46] <monika__> there is no problem in terminal
[07:46] <TurtleBoots> klip: perfecto!!! I will try this and let you know :-)
[07:46] <LjL> monika__, what's the problem?
[07:46] <un_operateur> francesco, is  /dev/hda4  where you intend /var now?
[07:46] <francesco> un_operateur: yes
[07:46] <monika__> LjL: i can't browse whole partition from konqueror
[07:46] <DanaG> TurtleBoots: if it fails
[07:46] <klip> TurtleBoots, If X won't start, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf section driver. Change "nvidia" to "nv"
[07:46] <DanaG> use nvidia-glx-legacy
[07:46] <un_operateur> francesco, and you've rebooted??
[07:47] <LjL> monika__: what do you mean "the whole partition"? what partition?
[07:47] <francesco> un_operateur: of course
[07:47] <unimatrix9> ok got to run bye
[07:47] <unimatrix9> :P
[07:47] <Gun_Smok1> Tried edgy for 2 days now.. seems like crap
[07:47] <nolimitsoya> LjL, the media archive is located outside of ~, and she wants to navigate it but cant

[07:47] <francesco> i get "mount: special device /dev/shm/var.run does not exist" (same for var.lock) on boot
[07:47] <LjL> !hidden | monika__, nolimitsoya, perhaps
[07:47] <monika__> LjL: in konqueror (and all kde software) i see only home directory and removable devices

[07:47] <LjL> monika__: /home and /media you mean
[07:47] <DanaG> There IS an UP button.
[07:47] <monika__> yes
[07:47] <LjL> monika__: look at that page
[07:47] <monika__> ubotu: i'll check it out
[07:48] <DanaG> And the backspace key.
[07:48] <LjL> monika__: ubotu is a bot
[07:48] <nolimitsoya> monika__, ubotu is a bot that LjLkindly called to aid :)
[07:48] <DanaG> Oh, a question about Amarok: how do you resize the file columns (on the left)?
[07:48] <DanaG> There are no headers to grab.
[07:48] <TurtleBoots> klip: can we do private chat so I Can paste the error... its along the lines of... Error: your X configuration has been altered.

[07:49] <monika__> "The root directory contains a file called /.hidden. Open this in a text editor and delete the names of the directories which you want to have shown."
[07:49] <Zodiac`> is it possible to run Adobe Photoshop CS2 with Wine or CrossOver or something?
[07:49] <monika__> will that be okay if i blank this file?
[07:49] <klip> TurtleBoots,  Hmm,  this is not unusual. It should say that you have to restart X. I remember having that message, too.
[07:49] <klip> TurtleBoots, But I am not 100% sure.
[07:50] <nolimitsoya> monika__, if you want to see all the dirs, i guess it would
[07:50] <DanaG> Or it might be saying to manually edit it.
[07:50] <un_operateur> monika__, it would mean all the directories will be shown
[07:50] <DanaG> I see no /.hidden
[07:50] <nolimitsoya> DanaG, are you a kde user?
[07:50] <un_operateur> Zodiac`, sure
[07:50] <monika__> DanaG: in / directory
[07:50] <Zodiac`> un_operateur, you know how?
[07:50] <DanaG> ctrl-h
[07:50] <DanaG> is hide-show in SOME things.
[07:51] <un_operateur> DanaG, files beginning with a . are not shown
[07:51] <sharp15> does ubuntu have a method for editing system start-up (similar to rc-update on gentoo)?

[07:51] <Zodiac`> un_operateur, it takes long time to download CS2, and it is ISO.. Wine run ISO?
[07:51] <monika__> :) i wonder who had invented it and why
[07:52] <DanaG> I'm not using Feisty -- it broke some Beryl stuff.
[07:52] <CotRo|eR> is drapper better than edgy for server use?

[07:52] <DanaG> I do have the Feisty repos enabled, but zero priority through /etc/apt/preferences
[07:52] <sharp15> pike: ubuntu 6.10,  i think that's "edgy".
[07:52] <DanaG> so I manually Feisty'd a few things.
[07:52] <nolimitsoya> monika__, the kde people probably thought it confused newcomers. most users should move outside ~ anyway
[07:52] <sharp15> pike_: ubuntu 6.10,  i think that's "edgy".
[07:52] <un_operateur> Zodiac, an ISO is just an image -- you'll have to install the contents
[07:52] <nolimitsoya> *shouldnt
[07:53] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[07:53] <monika__> nolimitsoya: well, i have few partitions, other distributions etc.
[07:53] <nolimitsoya> monika__, then you dont count as the average user id guess ;)
[07:53] <monika__> there should be info to more advanced users
[07:54] <monika__> :)
[07:54] <nolimitsoya> monika__, agreed :)
[07:54] <pike_> sharp15: well i usually just look in /etc/init.d then if there is a script there i dont need (thats half of them) i "sudo update-rc.d -f scriptname remove"  not sure about adding scripts other than doing symlinks manually im sure there's a tool for it
[07:54] <monika__> :) you're more helpful then #ubuntu-pl's guys
[07:54] <monika__> than
[07:54] <un_operateur> francesco, that looks ok -- but have a read here - http://lists.samba.org/archive/linux/2002-June/003394.html

[07:56] <Ciaus> i have it working, but it keeps dropping
[07:56] <monika__> i must go, bye
[07:56] <To1> ciaus, what isp are you using?
[07:56] <Ciaus> verizon
[07:56] <Ciaus> is the carrier
[07:57] <Ciaus> the verizon broadband PC Card
[07:57] <fabiand> hey - i've got an "unexpected" behavior: my laptop becomes slow, when i start recharging it ... does someone know this problem?
[07:57] <To1> o right, i had some trouble with talk talk mtu setting which seemed like it was repeatedly dropping the line, dont know if same problem....
[07:57] <anorexicpillow> hmm
[07:58] <jpablo> Hi, does anyone knows packages of sane 1.0.18 for 6.06 ?
[07:58] <Ciaus> Tol what is talk talk
[07:58] <jpablo> i tryed to install sid's ones. but they depends on debians libc6.

[07:58] <Ciaus> I am using the wvdial from a terminal session
[07:58] <Ciaus> oh
[07:58] <Ciaus> the modem that5 the card is gets initialized et al just fine...
[07:59] <CotRo|eR> hey guys if I install ubuntu for home use, I can set up a normal server right?
[07:59] <To1> ..but then drops off?
[07:59] <Zodiac`> Wolfenstein: Enemy territory works bad on Linux (fail to load config etc.), do you think it would get better with Windows version? (Wine/CrossOver)
[07:59] <Ciaus> Tol, yuppers
[07:59] <To1> CotRo|eR: you can install the server packages yes
[08:00] <pike_> CotRo|eR: the only diff between server install and normal ubuntu is extra desktop packages basically (gnome, openoffice)
[08:00] <Ciaus> > The PPP daemon has died: A modem hung up the phone (exit code = 16)
[08:00] <Ciaus> --> man pppd explains pppd error codes in more detail.
[08:00] <Ciaus> --> Try again and look into /var/log/messages and the wvdial and pppd man pages for more information.
[08:00] <Ciaus> thats what iget
[08:01] <Ciaus> i am stumped
[08:01] <klip> Zodiac`, my ET works perfectly well.
[08:01] <pike_> Zodiac`: works perfect for me and has survived 2 dist-upgrades..
[08:01] <francesco> un_operateur: well i want to move the whole /var directory, that's currently in the same partition as /, to a whole new partition. and i did copied stuff around in single user mode
[08:01] <klip> Zodiac`, did you install it from the RPM-package?
[08:01] <sharp15> pike_: i was looking to add to the runlevels, but now i've got a place to start.  thanks for the help.
[08:01] <erUSUL> Zodiac`: i know that this is not helpfull but mine too
[08:02] <francesco> un_operateur: seems to me that it tries to mount /var/run and /var/lock before /var is mounted at all
[08:02] <Zodiac`> klip, configs wont load
[08:02] <Zodiac`> klip, im a serious ET player, plays in clan etc.. Cant play without config.. :/  (autoexec.cfg)
[08:02] <klip> Zodiac`, Hmmm, strange. Tried to run it once as root? Close it immediately and run again without root-permissions.
[08:02] <Ciaus> is there a "better way" to establish a dun connection than to use the wvdial
[08:03] <Zodiac`> klip, do you use config? (what about you pike_?)
[08:03] <klip> Zodiac`, My config loads well. But did not in the beginning, I remember that.
[08:03] <klip> Zodiac`, But I can't remember what i did to make it work.
[08:03] <Zodiac`> klip, you know how you fixed it? .P
[08:03] <Zodiac`> k
[08:04] <Zodiac`> klip, do you have msn? so i can annoy you more? =D (JK.)
[08:04] <klip> Zodiac`, It was something very easy... Suppose I had to run it once as root, but I'm not sure.
[08:04] <klip> Zodiac`,  ^^
[08:06] <Zodiac`> klip, can i get your msn adress?=P
[08:06] <rogue780> !ftp

[08:06] <eyalw> avid/clear
[08:07] <Zodiac`> klip, my problem is that i can load my config, once.. but when i edit it and run ET again, it wont load as edited if you know what i mean.. I try to exec it again, no luck.. :
[08:07] <dromer> !chime

[08:08] <dromer> anybody*
[08:08] <Zodiac`> klip, you get my problem? maybe I should search google.. you know what to search for? =P
[08:08] <mc44> dromer: if its a firefox extension install it through firefox

[08:09] <runes> Is there any package for remote desktop from windows to ubuntu?  I tried to install freenx but it is not part of the packages?
[08:09] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, open what with nano?
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, if you edit with an editor that inserts (invisible) special chars, youll be in trouble and it wont load correctly
[08:09] <erchache> NIC HP NC373i has linux drivers?
[08:09] <mc44> dromer: oh plugin right, well if there isnt a linux version it might not work
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, the cfg
[08:09] <Zodiac`> aha

[08:09] <ubotu> compilerwriter: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops...
[08:09] <Zodiac`> i edit it with "open with (Textediter)"
[08:10] <Zodiac`> something like that
[08:10] <mc44> dromer: chime is the moleculer viewer right?
[08:10] <dromer> uhuh
[08:10] <klip> Zodiac`,  I think I have it. "sudo chown -R user:group ~/.etwolf/", where user:group is your username and group.
[08:10] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, dont. i know nothing of this texteditor, but id guess thats the problem
[08:10] <klip> After that it worked.
[08:10] <mc44> dromer: http://ariadne.mse.uiuc.edu/Info/Chime/chime_linux.html
[08:10] <dromer> lol, I was just viewing that one :)
[08:11] <mc44> dromer: seems rather out of date
[08:11] <dromer> uhuh, and crossover has 'trial'-versions and stuff :/
[08:12] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, its the default texteditor for ubuntu..
[08:12] <dromer> Despite many requests for a linux Chime MDL has declined to offer one.
[08:12] <klip> Zodiac`, You got my message above?
[08:12] <delta> Hi. I've dapper installed and some problem with the graphic card. Should I upgrade to edgy?
[08:12] <Zodiac`> (btw, i dont want to sound arrogant, when i say that i have to have config since I'm "serious player")
[08:12] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, well i havent been running ubuntu since 5.10 so i wouldnt know/remember much about it :)
[08:12] <Zodiac`> klip, you mean: sudo chown -R zodiac ~/.etwolf/
[08:13] <Zodiac`> ?
[08:13] <klip> Indeed, but don't forget the group behind your name.
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, you shouldnt exclude your group
[08:13] <klip> btw it makes custom-maps run.
[08:13] <Zodiac`> my group would be zodiac-laptop?
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, check to make sure :)
[08:14] <Zodiac`> zodiac is both :P
[08:14] <klip> Good.
[08:14] <clearscreen> just did apt-get install xserver-xorg, startx whines about not being able to open default font 'fixed' /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts is empty.. where did they go?
[08:14] <Zodiac`> klip, im done now.. but none text came up..
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> clearscreen, you need to apt-get xfonts-base
[08:15] <clearscreen> thanks
[08:15] <kenn> I need som ehelp. The problem is refresh rates. I have done everything, edited xorg.conf, used propreitery drivers, included modelines. Still i dont get my desired resolution of 800x600@85Hz. If someone is willing to help i can paste-bon my xorg.conf
[08:15] <klip> Now try ET again.
[08:15] <klip> Should have worked.
[08:15] <iratik> Whats the chmod command for drwxr-xr-x ?
[08:15] <runes> Is there an easy way to set up remote access for my user accounts?
[08:15] <isofunk> you tell me ;)
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> clearscreen, if you want the full xorg suite apt-get xorg instead of xserver-xorg
[08:16] <clearscreen> ah, ok its working
[08:16] <Zodiac`> klip, ET loads with config.. but not the config i updated..
[08:16] <nolimitsoya> !pastebin | kenn
[08:16] <ubotu> kenn: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:16] <clearscreen> figured I just needed the xserver and a window manager .. I was wrong
[08:16] <klip> Zodiac`, Hm, I don't understand that...
[08:16] <kenn> nolimitsoya: Here you go, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37948/
[08:17] <kenn> If someone has experiece in setting resolution rates, please consider seeing my above xorg.conf and helping me out. Thank you
[08:17] <zerotime> hi, how can i make my ntfs-fuse partition to show up under "places"?, and how can I tell the system to mount ntfs-fuse for a usb?
[08:17] <Zodiac`> klip, well.. i have downloaded an config.. from my friend.. and started ET, it loaded with his config.. then i edited the config, and then tryed to start ET with the new config, but ET starts with his config, and wont load my new.. If you get it :/
[08:17] <nolimitsoya> kenn, cant say i can help you, sorry :)

[08:18] <klip> Zodiac`, Ever thought about the possibility that ET hates you? ^^
[08:18] <Stormx2> I want to be able to print to this printer. How?
[08:18] <Zodiac`> klip, yeah maybe, since im so lowskilled and stuff XD
[08:18] <Owner> hello

[08:18] <klip> Zodiac`, lol ;)
[08:18] <kenn> nolimitsoya: Have can someone work at a computer which filckers?
[08:18] <nolimitsoya> Zodiac`, have you tried the autoexec.cfg approach instead?
[08:18] <Zodiac`> i use autoexec ofc
[08:18] <nolimitsoya> kenn, they cant, why you need at least 120hz, not just 85
[08:18] <zerotime> hi anyone?
[08:18] <nolimitsoya> kenn, myself, i got an lcd ;)
[08:19] <G|wRGoS> can i make a folder's shortcut in linux?
[08:19] <Zodiac`> but ET seems to load an config from its cache, instead of from my edited config
[08:19] <nolimitsoya> G|wRGoS, yes
[08:19] <Mortuis> Is there a way to restart the sound server?
[08:19] <kenn> Can someone please help me? I dont get the correct resolution rates after trying everything available.
[08:19] <G|wRGoS> how?
[08:19] <klip> Mortuis, killall esd to kill it, esd to start it.
[08:20] <Mortuis> Thanks

[08:20] <kenn> Cant anyone help me set resolution rates?
[08:21] <fkumro> kenn, edit xorg.conf

[08:21] <Ropechoborra> !codecs
[08:21] <kenn> fkumro: I edited it, put in the correct horiz/vert rates, added modelines, still cant get it

[08:21] <klip> Mortuis, Yes, I have the same problem.
[08:21] <Mortuis> I was watching a movie and closed it by accident, now I don't get sound and I'd prefer to not have to restart if I can help it.
[08:21] <To1> have you got a .asoudrc file?
[08:22] <klip> Mortuis, I restart X in those cases, but for some people, esd works.
[08:22] <klip> Dont know why.
[08:22] <slyboots_> got a Audigy 2 card here, audio works in Stereo but if I run speaker-test, the other speakers dont work
[08:22] <Mortuis> doh, ohwell.  Thanks klip
[08:22] <slyboots_> Checked Alsaconf to see if the volume was set for those speakers, everything was fine
[08:22] <fkumro> kenn, hmm driver issue maybe? I dont know why it would ignore those values. Are those the only values in xorg.conf? Sometimes it will fall back on some values
[08:22] <Mortuis> restart X is ctrl-alt-backspace, right?
[08:22] <pike_> slyboots_: type "alsamixer" in terminal
[08:23] <To1> slybots, create a file in you home dir called .asoundrc
[08:23] <Zodiac`> !wolfenstein

[08:23] <kenn> Mortuis: yes
[08:23] <Mortuis> thanks
[08:23] <nolimitsoya> kenn, did you restart x between editing your xorg.conf?
[08:23] <kenn> nolimitsoya: yes
[08:23] <fkumro> kenn, I wish I could help but the only other time my monitor flickered is when it was dieing and I replaced with with an lcd so im sorry but I cant be of much more help. Maybe someone else can chime in

[08:24] <Owner> can someone help me? im having trouble with my hard disks. im wanting to isntall ubuntu or kubuntu 6.10, and i have both downloaded and burned the .iso to cd's. when i boot from them it works fine and when i hit the install icon and go through the steps, i hit step 5 and choose to manually partition my drives, and gparted comes up and wont load, so i tried the gparted live cd, it also booted...
[08:24] <Owner> ...fine and even recognized my drives, so i tell it to make a ext3 and linux-swap partition on one of my drives, error says too many bad sectors... so i cant partition my drives. means no linux :( (btw im trying to dual boot windows xp home and linux) so is there anyway to fix my drives? i have both defragmented AND run chkdsk a couple times. i really want to run linux!!! (im new to it compeltely)
[08:24] <Crescendo_> I love when I'm on a questionable website, and a little box pops up:  "Where do you want to save 'dialer.exe'?"  - thank god for Linux. :)
[08:24] <sedrake> How do I install a local deb package in terminal?
[08:24] <nolimitsoya> kenn, have you tried setting things up with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'+
[08:24] <klip> Crescendo, ;) ^^
[08:24] <nolimitsoya> ?
[08:24] <kale> sedrake: dpkg -i
[08:25] <kenn> nolimitsoya: That was how i first tried it
[08:25] <kenn> nolimitsoya: And then when it didn;t work properly i manually edited the xorg.conf
[08:25] <pike_> Owner: if yoy dont use xp for gaming you can wipe the drive and install ubuntu then vmware server to run xp inside

[08:26] <mamzers555> kenn; what do you mean?
[08:26] <Wiz> Are there any on-line virus scanners for Linux?
[08:27] <nolimitsoya> Wiz, clamav
[08:27] <kenn> kale: what are those? I took the horiz and vert rates of my monitor from the manual (31-54x50-99) and entered it correctly.

[08:28] <Wiz> nolimitsoya, would I be able to remove the bootsector virus through an on-line scan?
[08:28] <Otacon22> i need the link.
[08:28] <pike_> Owner: i guess you could try partition magic inside xp
[08:29] <Owner> i have -_-
[08:29] <Owner> does this mean i have to get ANOTHER hard drive?
[08:29] <nolimitsoya> Otacon22, yes, well, you are asking for an outdated and obsolete version that shouldnt have any capabilities the newer versions dont have... lets be fair?

[08:32] <nolimitsoya> Owner, s.m.a.r.t is a system where the driver log errors and can notify the admin if they are about to fail. cfdisk is a linux equivalent of fdisk, used for partitioning
[08:32] <slyboots_> Got stereo working, just not surround
[08:32] <pike_> Owner: cfdisk is a partitioner it can create or delete but not resize
[08:33] <kurbacik> anybody has configured suspend and/or hibernate in dapper?
[08:33] <Owner> oh, yeah i need to resize that the problem
[08:33] <Music_Shuffle> Does S.M.A.R.T...work?
[08:33] <Owner> and SMART is still confising, it doesnt fix jsut says if its gonna die?
[08:33] <x-r00t-x> nolimitsoya, i cant problem with usplash . can you help me ?
[08:33] <TehBigToe> mhm
[08:33] <nolimitsoya> Owner, resizeing is dangerous and not recommended unless you have a backup, in which case you might as well partition anew and reinsert the backup
[08:33] <nolimitsoya> x-r00t-x, nope, sorry
[08:34] <Owner> hmmm, cause ive resized before no problem lol, mayeb that ruind it
[08:34] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle, yes, it does :)
[08:34] <TehBigToe> how do I make my graphics tablet work?
[08:34] <rogue780> how do I see what programs are using port 21?
[08:34] <x-r00t-x> oops mistakes  i *need* problem with usplash
[08:34] <Music_Shuffle> Interesting.
[08:34] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle, that is... ive never seem a failed drive without smartlogs telling me there is some serious issues, but not all of them have been able to warn, since the problem struck like lightning
[08:34] <nolimitsoya> *seen
[08:34] <linnuxxy> is there a localized version of ubuntu built as a downloadable CD?
[08:35] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah, that was what I was wondering about
[08:35] <rjg__> Would anyone know of a skinnable nautilus replacement, on a way of making one a program a diffent beryl theme and GTK theme??
[08:35] <nolimitsoya> Music_Shuffle, of course, if you scratch up your discs with a headcrash, smart couldnt possibly have forseen that.
[08:35] <pike_> Owner: ask for a hd for christmas :)
[08:35] <sedrake> Is it possible to cinfigure Ubuntus "Remote Desktop" from terminal?
[08:35] <Music_Shuffle> LOL. Why not!? RAWR.
[08:35] <zerotime> ok I have mounted ntfs-3g partition, but I cant mount usb drives automatically as ntfs-3g
[08:35] <zerotime> how can I do that?
[08:36] <Owner> :P im pretty sure ive gotten a Wii so i dotn need the computer for a couple months anyways
[08:36] <paranoia16> how can i install .tar.gz?
[08:36] <nolimitsoya> pike_, Owner, since chkdsk comes up blank (was it a surface scan?) i dont think there is a hw problem. perhaps just incompatibility
[08:36] <linnuxxy> is there a localized version of ubuntu ( to any language) built as a downloadable CD?
[08:36] <PriceChild> paranoia16, it will have instructions inside
[08:36] <nolimitsoya> zerotime, usb mass storage devices should automount
[08:36] <paranoia16> in the folder after unzipped?
[08:36] <PriceChild> paranoia16, what bit of software is it? its best to use the repositories if possbile
[08:37] <paranoia16> neverball.tar.gz, i don't think its in the repositories is it?
[08:37] <zerotime> they automount, but not with read and write rights?
[08:37] <Owner> hmm, well chkdsk takes forever and i dotn watch it but sometiems it deletes things then replaces the orphand file, otherwise it runs normal then compeltes it
[08:37] <mc44> !neverball | paranoia16
[08:37] <ubotu> neverball: 3D arcade games: neverball & neverputt. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.4.0-2ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 158 kB, installed size 468 kB
[08:37] <TehBigToe> how do I make my graphics tablet work?
[08:37] <nolimitsoya> zerotime, perhaps you could add them to the fstab with a uuid setting them to automount?
[08:38] <mc44> paranoia16: its in universe
[08:38] <zerotime> I have tried though,
[08:38] <Blake1> Does anyone know a good tutorial to set up samba on ubuntu 6.10?
[08:39] <recurrente> Hi, can someone help me with a problem with a USB wifi card? (SMC2662W v4)
[08:39] <rogue780> !samba | Blake1
[08:39] <ubotu> Blake1: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[08:39] <zerotime> but will I have to edit fstab each time?
[08:39] <erchache> where i can download drivers for NIC nc373i
[08:40] <noelferreira> hi people! i don't have sound in my system since i installed 32 bit firefox in my amd64 machine (i followed this howto).
[08:40] <Owner> well i suppose ill jsut get a new hdd and start off makin it 2 partitions and only use 1 for linux then leave the other as backup space. thanks for the help, il lget back if i need mroe!
[08:40] <pike_> Blake1: wiki.ubuntu.com
[08:40] <noelferreira> sorry
[08:40] <noelferreira> hi people! i don't have sound in my system since i installed 32 bit firefox in my amd64 machine (i followed this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava).
[08:40] <Blake1> thanks
[08:41] <x-r00t-x> noelferreira, do not repeat
[08:41] <paranoia16> is there a way to test and see if 3d accelerated grahpics is on?  i just set up my geforce and want to see if its all being used corectly
[08:41] <logomancer> paranoia: glxinfo
[08:41] <PriceChild> paranoia16, "glxgears"
[08:42] <PriceChild> paranoia16, if you use glxinfo, then it will say "direct rendering yes/no"
[08:42] <rogue780> does anyone here use proftpd?
[08:42] <PriceChild> !anyone | rogue780
[08:42] <delta> I've dapper installed and some problem with the graphic card. Should I upgrade to edgy?
[08:42] <ubotu> rogue780: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:42] <recurrente> when I plug the usb wifi card,  the keyboard freezes, when I unplug it, all keys pressed appears on the screen (it is a normal ps/2 keyboard)
[08:43] <nolimitsoya> rogue780, there are guides for setting it up on the wiki
[08:43] <rogue780> nolimitsoya, I've got it setup, but I can't connect to it
[08:43] <recurrente> maybe a problem with irqs? Same problems in two different computers, with 6.06 and 6.10
[08:43] <bounce|warlock> Anyone know where the network configuration is stored (For eth0, eth1) etc ?
[08:43] <nolimitsoya> rogue780, then it cant be set up, can it ;) or are you firewalled?
[08:44] <visik7> bounce|warlock: /etc/network/interfaces
[08:44] <PriceChild> bounce|warlock, I think, /etc/network/interfaces
[08:44] <K1GPL> is it just me, or is the pdf plugin for ff crashing every time its used the past couple of days
[08:44] <visik7> bounce|warlock: interfaces(5)
[08:44] <PriceChild> visik7, aww too slow
[08:44] <rogue780> nolimitsoya, it's all internal on my network, and this computer doesn't have a personal firewall setup
[08:44] <visik7> see up
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> rogue780, then i will, again, suggest you have a look at the wiki
[08:45] <rogue780> nolimitsoya, I installed it based on the ubuntu guide
[08:45] <CoRnJuLiOx> hey, ive installed the xscreensaver-extra package from synaptic, but it didn't really add anything new to the screensaver menu...
[08:45] <CoRnJuLiOx> am i missing something here?
[08:45] <PriceChild> rogue780, ubuntuguide or ubuntu wiki?
[08:46] <reiatsu> Whatzup PriceChild
[08:46] <PriceChild> hello reiatsu ?
[08:46] <noelferreira> hi people! i don't have sound in my system since i installed 32 bit firefox in my amd64 machine (i followed this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava).
[08:46] <reiatsu> PriceChild, just saying hi ;0
[08:47] <PriceChild> hello to you too :)
[08:47] <PriceChild> noelferreira, sure you haven't changed anything else?
[08:47] <rogue780> PriceChild, ubuntuguide, since the ubuntu wiki has less information on proftpd than bill gates has on style
[08:47] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya, ^
[08:47] <NeF_za> Hey, I've tried installing ubuntu 5.10 and 6.10 plus tried using the ubuntu 5.10 live disk. Not very far into the installation process, I get a message saying that X server is unable to start and that I must reconfig my gdm. I have no idea what to do.
[08:47] <NeF_za> My box specs are Intel 1.73 centrino, gig of ram, nvida 6600 go 128mb, 60 hdd.
[08:47] <Shaba1> Hello folks
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> PriceChild, ^^
[08:48] <PriceChild> noelferreira, are you sure things aren't muted etc.? -  simple things first
[08:48] <noelferreira> no PriceChild. something to do with the howto i refered about esd sound
[08:48] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya, i was pointing to the fact that he used ubuntuguide rather than wiki seen as you tried talking to him
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> rogue780, i suggest you look again. there are step-by-step instructions
[08:48] <Shaba1> Windows allows you to put shortcut icons on the desktop to specific application that when double clicked will run those apps. How does one do that in Gnome?
[08:48] <PriceChild> sorry if you didn't want me pinging you
[08:48] <PriceChild> Shaba1, right click "create launcher"
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> PriceChild, and i was making the ^^ smiley in reponse :)
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> *s
[08:48] <noelferreira> the problem is this PriceChild: i have sound every time i reboot. however if i use sound in web aplications i become with no sound in my system. do you understand?
[08:49] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya, ha ha ok :)
[08:49] <pekkle01> Hi ... if this has been answered in some FAQ elsewhere please direct me there ... I'm new to IRC, Ubuntu, and Linux in general (more or less)
[08:49] <pekkle01> I'd installed Dapper Drake via the CD-ROM
[08:49] <PriceChild> noelferreira, Ok i getcha :D
[08:49] <Shaba1> thank you prince child
[08:49] <pekkle01> and upgraded to Edgy Eft
[08:49] <Gun_Smoke> Beryl or Comiz?
[08:49] <PriceChild> noelferreira, "killall esd" will get sound back
[08:49] <Stormx2> pekkle01: Ask away, don't apologise ;-)
[08:49] <PriceChild> noelferreira, need to fix the "real" issue though
[08:49] <lupine_85> Gun_Smoke: depends ?
[08:49] <rogue780> nolimitsoya, I suggest you look again, since it really has NO useful information. it tells me what it is, what it does, and three variables that I can modify in the conf file that really amount to nothing
[08:49] <pekkle01> via the apt-get methods (and then later aptitude)
[08:49] <PriceChild> Shaba1, no 'n' ;)
[08:49] <noelferreira> what should i do for that PriceChild?
[08:49] <PriceChild> noelferreira, one second
[08:49] <pekkle01> however the install seems to get stuck on the upgrade to flashplugin-nonfree
[08:50] <pekkle01> during the Download part
[08:50] <Stormx2> pekkle01: Are you upgrading graphicly?
[08:50] <noelferreira> ok
[08:50] <Shaba1> Ok second question. Am I correct in assuming that ubuntu(not kbuntu or xbuntu) starts with the Gnome desktop and that it is flavor of debian linux?
[08:50] <pekkle01> via a terminal commandline?
[08:50] <pekkle01> e.g. sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
[08:50] <rogue780> nolimitsoya, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ProFTPD is what I'm looking at
[08:50] <Music_Shuffle> Shaba1, yeah, yeah.
[08:50] <Shaba1> thank you
[08:50] <Stormx2> pekkle01: Its got stuck upgrading, or are you in edgy now?
[08:50] <Shaba1> Ok what exactly is sudo?
[08:51] <pekkle01> I believe I'm on edgy now - how do I check?
[08:51] <Gun_Smoke> light on ram.. okay graphics card.. (btw what is the command to see exactly which card I have)
[08:51] <pekkle01> I didn't restart anything though
[08:51] <pekkle01> I didn't restart X or reboot the machine
[08:51] <ciplogic> Hi everyone, I've install apache2 and PHP 5, but Apache deosn't see the PHP module
[08:51] <rogue780> pekkle01, do you have firefox 2.0 or 1.5? that's a good way
[08:51] <pekkle01> FF 2.0
[08:51] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah.
[08:51] <rogue780> nolimitsoya, I think the problem is that something else is using port 21...but i dunno
[08:51] <Stormx2> pekkle01: Well... How did you upgrade? Via Terminal, Command Line, or using a graphical interface?
[08:51] <Music_Shuffle> Welcome then? ;P
[08:51] <Shaba1> BTW I am a windows systems admin for a poor non-profit that just got 15 machines donated along with a ubuntu cd.
[08:51] <Shaba1> That is why I am asking so many newbie question.
[08:51] <PriceChild> noelferreira, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-c268ba69c6b38af1dc31ea09701c7d296cf971c3 please go to "Flash Troubleshooting" and do the alsa-oss bit
[08:51] <pekkle01> Via terminal (i.e. I had a terminal window opened and typed the apt-get commands in there)
[08:52] <Stormx2> pekkle01: And did you install the flashplayer-nonfree before or after upgrading to edgy?
[08:52] <K1GPL> Shaba1   great!
[08:52] <Renji> hi
[08:52] <pekkle01> I think it was trying to upgrade it as part of the entire update process?
[08:52] <sedrake> its possible to download stuff trough ssh?
[08:52] <pekkle01> e.g. I used sudo apt-get update && ...
[08:52] <Stormx2> pekkle01: And it just froze?
[08:52] <Shaba1> We do not have the money to buy 15 XP cds
[08:52] <Renji> i have problem with lunch ET i got this error
[08:52] <PriceChild> Shaba1, keep it up! :D
[08:52] <Music_Shuffle> Shaba1, lol!
[08:52] <rogue780> Shaba1, sudo is short (I believe) for super user doer...it basically allows you to do one command as the super user
[08:52] <Renji> ./et.x86: error while loading shared libraries: libX11.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[08:52] <kurbacik> Has anybody has configured suspend and/or hibernate in dapper on an HP ZV5000 laptop?
[08:52] <pekkle01> well it seemed to get stuck when trying to download the flash things
[08:52] <Renji> anyone knows how to fix it
[08:52] <Music_Shuffle> !sudo
[08:52] <Renji> ??
[08:52] <rogue780> Shaba1, it is like su, but it doesn't actually switch user
[08:52] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:52] <pekkle01> when I hit Ctrl-C it seemed to continue on
[08:52] <pekkle01> with the other things
[08:52] <pekkle01> installs*
[08:53] <K1GPL> no matter how much money you have, you can't afford to run windows
[08:53] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Good choice then ;-) I've got enough money for a windows license and I use ubuntu by choice :P
[08:53] <nolimitsoya> Shaba1, ill support you any i can :)
[08:53] <Shaba1> BUT we do already have a win2k server network. So I have go to find someway of getting these new computers on the network with ubuntu.
[08:53] <nolimitsoya> *way
[08:53] <Stormx2> Shaba1: SAMBA will do that
[08:53] <PriceChild> !samba | Shaba1
[08:53] <ubotu> Shaba1: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> Shaba1, if you want to share, samba it what you want. if you just want to connect youll want dhpc server set up on the windows box
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> *is
[08:54] <captainbeefheart> hey can someone help me?
[08:54] <Music_Shuffle> !ask
[08:54] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:54] <delta> I've dapper installed and some problem with the graphic card. Should I upgrade to edgy?
[08:54] <rogue780> so...anyway, still can't get proftpd to work right. I can stop it start it restart it and it says everything is peachy, but I can't ftp into my system
[08:54] <PriceChild> !ask | captainbeefheart
[08:54] <ubotu> captainbeefheart: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:54] <kurbacik> Has anybody has configured suspend and/or hibernate in dapper on a HP ZV5000?
[08:54] <zerotime> I got a question about beryl, ok, borders change, but the rest does not,
[08:54] <Stormx2> PriceChild: Don't repeat that.
[08:55] <PriceChild> Stormx2, sorry, my mistake
[08:55] <Stormx2> PriceChild: No problem heh..
[08:55] <zerotime> how to change colours and everything I could change with metacity?
[08:55] <Shaba1> Well my first task is to install wine and  windows mozilla then download the windows shockwave and flash plugins for mozilla and put a shortcut to the windows version of firefox on the desktop
[08:55] <nolimitsoya> delta, depends. if edgy is right for you, why arent you running it alread? if it isnt, then the awnser is 'no, you shouldnt upgrade under any circumstances'. whats the problem you are having with your card?
[08:55] <pike_> rogue780: cant ftp into 127.0.0.1 ?
[08:55] <Stormx2> zerotime: You mean window titles, etc?
[08:55] <PriceChild> Shaba1, why not use native applications? All that is availiable on linux
[08:55] <captainbeefheart> i got w32codecs in terminal and when i went to dpkg i got 'cannot access archive no such file or directory
[08:55] <kurbacik> Has anybody has configured suspend and/or hibernate in dapper on a HP ZV 5000 laptop?
[08:55] <tannerld> is there a way I can take a screenshot from the terminal?
[08:55] <radar1976_alt> anyone here use evolution for hosted gmail?
[08:55] <nolimitsoya> Shaba1, why would you want that? mozilla is linux native
[08:55] <rogue780> pike_, 192.168.1.101 or localhost
[08:55] <Shaba1> They do not make a linux version of the shockwave program and the organization that helped us get these computers uses a web site that requires shockwave and flash.
[08:55] <Stormx2> radar1976_alt: I did.
[08:56] <PriceChild> captainbeefheart, you can double click on the file in a gui to install it if that's easier?
[08:56] <zerotime> yes
[08:56] <nolimitsoya> Shaba1, flashplugin-nonfree is in the repos, and it can handle flash
[08:56] <nolimitsoya> Shaba1, and shockwave...
[08:56] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Flash works fine on ubuntu. Shockwave? Thats pretty outdated isn't it?
[08:56] <zerotime> I mean buttons, and everything
[08:56] <PriceChild> captainbeefheart, other than that ,please us "ls" to ensure that you are in the correct directory
[08:56] <captainbeefheart> ok price but i dont see the file anywhere
[08:56] <delta> nolimitsoya, I didn't upgrade yet because I hadn't the time to upgrade, possibly break the system and find time to fix it.
[08:56] <zerotime> beryl only changes borders
[08:56] <PriceChild> captainbeefheart, where did you download it?
[08:56] <delta> nolimitsoya, opengl doesn't work right.
[08:56] <Stormx2> captainbeefheart: Are you in the correct directory?
[08:56] <captainbeefheart> /tmp/
[08:56] <Shaba1> Stormx2 like I said above
[08:56] <noelferreira> PriceChild: killall didn't resolve my sound problem
[08:56] <captainbeefheart> im assuming
[08:56] <Stormx2> captainbeefheart: Where did you download the file to?
[08:56] <rogue780> pike_, I always get Cannot connect to 127.0.0.1: Connection refused. replace the ip with 192.168.1.101 or localhost and you get all my errors
[08:57] <PriceChild> noelferreira, "killall esd"?
[08:57] <PriceChild> noelferreira, not just "killall"
[08:57] <captainbeefheart> i did a wget /tmp/ command
[08:57] <Shaba1> PriceChild like I said above
[08:57] <PriceChild> Shaba1, yup :(
[08:57] <Stormx2> rogue780: Have you tried following the forum guide?
[08:57] <nolimitsoya> Shaba1, you are missing something here. there are linux native versions of both flash/sw and the mozilla suite
[08:57] <pike_> rogue780: sudo iptables -L  shows everything accept right?
[08:57] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya, there isn't native shockwave
[08:57] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya, AFAIK
[08:57] <Stormx2> captainbeefheart: wget gets a file. The first parameter is the address.
[08:57] <rogue780> pike_, everything is accept
[08:57] <nolimitsoya> PriceChild, i thought the flashplugin supported shockwave?
[08:57] <captainbeefheart> ok....
[08:57] <Stormx2> captainbeefheart; Have you tried following the wiki on w32codecs?
[08:58] <rogue780> there's a forum guide? I've only tried ubuntuguide and the ubuntu wiki'
[08:58] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya, not AFAIK
[08:58] <Flannel> nolimitsoya: nope.  No shockwave on linux
[08:58] <captainbeefheart> yes thats what i did storm
[08:58] <Stormx2> rogue780: Well follow the wiki.
[08:58] <delta> nolimitsoya, any idea?
[08:58] <zerotime> 4Stormx2
[08:58] <PriceChild> nolimitsoya, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Shockwave
[08:58] <captainbeefheart> it seemed to download the file
[08:58] <rogue780> Stormx2, the wiki for proftpd is worthless
[08:58] <captainbeefheart> then next step was to dpkg and thats where i got the error
[08:58] <Shaba1> There are linux versions of flash but NOT shockwave
[08:58] <zerotime> Stormx2
[08:58] <PriceChild> Shaba1, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Shockwave that will get you going on shockwave

[08:59] <Stormx2> captainbeefheart: Then go to your home directory. You will see a file called w32_codecs<something>.deb
[08:59] <ciplogic> Flannel: Apache itself works
[08:59] <captainbeefheart> storm that is the exact step i followed....and when dpkg i got the error
[09:00] <skreet> PriceChild: Thanks
[09:00] <Flannel> ciplogic: is php5.load and php5.conf in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/?
[09:00] <ciplogic> Flannel: only does not start wih php
[09:00] <ciplogic> I don't know :)
[09:00] <Stormx2> captainbeefheart: Give me the dpkg command you issued.
[09:00] <slavik> I got it done for ping, but need it for dns (so that firefox gets the same name/ip as does ping)
[09:00] <PriceChild> skreet, we look after ALL compositing there, not just xgl
[09:00] <PriceChild> skreet, outdated name which has just stuck :)
[09:00] <captainbeefheart> ok : sudo dpkg -i w32codecs.something.deb
[09:00] <ciplogic> Flannel: that are two files?
[09:00] <ciplogic> THere aren't at all
[09:01] <vanberge> whats the easiest way to change color depth?  edit xorg?
[09:01] <Stormx2> captainbeefheart: Okay. And what error did you receive?
[09:01] <ciplogic> Flannel: should I create them?
[09:01] <PriceChild> captainbeefheart, as long as you are in the correct directory containing it
[09:01] <Flannel> ciplogic: alright, do they exist in /etc/apache2/mods-available/?
[09:01] <Flannel> ciplogic: no, apache has a tool for it
[09:01] <captainbeefheart> let me try this and ill be back thanks for the help
[09:01] <ciplogic> Flannel: yes
[09:01] <ciplogic> Flannel: they are there
[09:02] <Shaba1> Thanks PriceChild I saw that page last night before I left work and was looking for it again
[09:02] <pike_> rogue780: someones made a gui front end to pureftpd called pureadmin you can remove pro and aptget em
[09:02] <captainbeefheart> error 404 not found
[09:02] <Shaba1> Ok two last questions
[09:02] <ciplogic> Flannel: what means that?
[09:02] <Flannel> ciplogic: alright, run this: sudo a2enmod php (er, might be php5)
[09:02] <Shaba1> What exactly is 'sudo'
[09:02] <Flannel> !sudo | Shaba1
[09:02] <ubotu> Shaba1: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:03] <Stormx2> Flannel: Quick off the mark aren't you? ;-)
[09:03] <shut-> is cannon ip1600 working on linux
[09:03] <Stormx2> shut-: Find out. Is there a driver available in System > Administration > Printing
[09:03] <Shaba1> And Can samba be installed on a workstation and that workstaion still be used for regular work or must it be installed on a dedicated server?
[09:04] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Workstation
[09:04] <Stormx2> Shaba1: You already have a windows network, right?
[09:04] <shut-> i dont got it yet as my pc is in the repair shop
[09:04] <vanberge> hey anybody just wondreing the easiest / best way to change color depth from 24 to 16... thanks in advance
[09:04] <PriceChild> Shaba1, it runs on each machine that needs access to the existing windows network
[09:04] <Shaba1> yes Stormx2
[09:04] <Shaba1> OK thank PriceChild
[09:04] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Well then samba should hook in, giving you access to shared files and printers, if thats what you want?
[09:04] <Shaba1> cool
[09:04] <klip> vanberge, /etc/X11/xorg.conf    You can change it there.
[09:04] <ciplogic> Flannel: works, thanks a lot
[09:04] <Shaba1> Ok last question
[09:05] <delta> nolimitsoya, ?
[09:05] <Stormx2> Shaba1: If you want, you can set samba up to share stuff to the network too, from your ubuntu machine
[09:05] <pike_> vanberge: its near bottom of config file
[09:05] <Music_Shuffle> Shaba1, ...you said that yesterday!
[09:05] <Music_Shuffle> ;P
[09:05] <Stormx2> Shaba1, ask as many as you like :)
[09:05] <Shaba1> is there anything in linux like a networked logon script as there is in Windows i.e. a kixtart script
[09:05] <Music_Shuffle> I jest, ask more, I feel like I know something.
[09:05] <Music_Shuffle> ^^
[09:05] <vanberge> klip, pike_ ok... i knew i could edit that file but wondered if that maybe was the wrong way to do it
[09:05] <klip> vanberge, No, it's alright to edit it :)
[09:05] <Boglizk> 'I recently reinstalled Ubuntu with my Ubuntu 5.10 cd, and upgraded to 6.06, now it doesn't bump me for a 6.10 update.
[09:06] <recurrente> Hi, when I plug the usb wifi card (SMC2662w v.4),  the keyboard freezes, when I unplug it, all keys pressed appears on the screen (it is a normal ps/2 keyboard). Of course, the card doesn't work...
[09:06] <Music_Shuffle> Did you upgrade everything?
[09:06] <PriceChild> Boglizk, that is normal.
[09:06] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Eek...
[09:06] <vanberge> klip, the reason i ask is because i changed the 24 in that file to a 16, and then beryl stopped running
[09:06] <Boglizk> PriceChild: I see, any ideas?
[09:06] <Music_Shuffle> I think you have to enable something, no?
[09:06] <PriceChild> Boglizk, Dapper is an extremely stable "LTS" release
[09:06] <Stormx2> recurrente: Wow! Thats odd!
[09:06] <Music_Shuffle> To display the Dapper -> Edgy?
[09:06] <klip> vanberge, hm, that's strange.
[09:06] <PriceChild> Boglizk, if you really want to update to "edgy" please see...
[09:06] <Shaba1> Becasue I have just installed ubuntu on one of these machines. Once I get it set up the way it should be I would like to just plug them into the network and have the OS and all the programs and setups that they need downloaded and started.
[09:07] <Shaba1> Rather then taking a cd around to each.
[09:07] <recurrente> 4Stormx2, yes, it is strange, in two machines with different hardware
[09:07] <Flannel> !upgrade | Boglizk
[09:07] <ubotu> Boglizk: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[09:07] <PriceChild> Boglizk, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[09:07] <Boglizk> Thanks :] 
[09:07] <klip> vanberge, Beryl needs 24-Bit to display windowframes for example.
[09:07] <klip> vanberge, 16-Bit won't work together with Beryl.
[09:07] <Stormx2> recurrente: Well look up your card on ubuntuforums.org, maybe?
[09:08] <vanberge> klip, really?  huh...   beryl docs say to change to 16 bit for better performance
[09:08] <Shaba1> Hello
[09:08] <zerotime> I want to change themes with beryl, but, beryl only changes borders
[09:08] <recurrente> 4Stormx2: yep, I looked for it. I have this problem since 2 months ago
[09:08] <vanberge> klip, at least i thought i read that somewhere
[09:08] <zerotime> is there anyway to change windows, and all?
[09:08] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Hey, sorry. i don't understand what you want to do, as I don't know what kixtart is
[09:08] <recurrente> With a 2.4 kernel in Debian had no problem
[09:08] <[ginge] > hiya I don't suppose anyone could spare me a couple of minutes, i'm completely new to Ubuntu and I'm trying to config Apache2 but failing horridly it's only a basic question it seems but following the docs that I've been pointed to don't seem to help me.
[09:08] <Stormx2> zerotime: check gnome-look.org
[09:08] <klip> vanberge, Okay, than forget what I've said ;) I only know about an error with windowframes when you use 16-Bit.
[09:08] <Shaba1> Its a windows scripting language
[09:09] <Stormx2> zerotime: You're looking for GTK2 themes.
[09:09] <Boglizk> PriceChild: That command does, according to the wiki, check for updates. I however did that.
[09:09] <malt1> when i create a linux account on the system, how can i get it not to add everyone with ssh access
[09:09] <Shaba1> Basically I would liek to get this one machine set up the way all of them should be.
[09:09] <vanberge> klip, you might be right... who knows!
[09:09] <Boglizk> I'll try it again though...
[09:09] <vanberge> :-)
[09:09] <Stormx2> [ginge] : Theres a wiki. are you following that?
[09:09] <Stormx2> !lamp | [ginge] 
[09:09] <ubotu> [ginge] : LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[09:09] <Shaba1> Then just connect the other 14 to the network and have them download the same configureation
[09:09] <vanberge> klip, yeah somebody in #beryl just confirmed 24 only
[09:09] <zerotime> But how can I change them?
[09:09] <PriceChild> Boglizk, sudo "update-manager -c"
[09:09] <Shaba1> so I do not have to run around with 14 cds
[09:10] <Boglizk> gksudo, yeah i know
[09:10] <zerotime> please, dont know how I can change metacity themes when using beryl
[09:10] <Boglizk> Ohh.. now it says, new dist.
[09:10] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Ah.
[09:10] <Boglizk> Wierdo.. it didn't before
[09:10] <Boglizk> oh well, thanks for the help. I'll be off
[09:10] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Well what you could do is output a list of installed packages, then input that into the other machines?
[09:10] <[ginge] > Stormx2: I'm not using the other cd iso, I've only just installed the Ubuntu 6.06 that came with the official Ubuntu book.
[09:11] <zerotime> Stormx2, the thing is I cant change themes
[09:11] <CotRo|eR> what does this mean? : bug: soft lockup detected on cpu #0!
[09:11] <Stormx2> zerotime: System > Preferences > Themes
[09:11] <Stormx2> zerotime: Installed GTK themes will show up under Custom > Controls
[09:11] <Flannel> [ginge] : that's fine.  There are instructions on that page, for how to set it up on a regular desktop
[09:12] <Flannel> zerotime: you might try #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl
[09:12] <Stormx2> [ginge] : yeah the instructions are for a regular desktop install.
[09:12] <Shaba1> how do I do that Stormx2
[09:13] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Not sure. Ask on the forums.
[09:13] <Shaba1> I mean I need to have ubuntu installed AND the apps that I have found that will make this one machine work the way I need it to.
[09:13] <Shaba1> Then I need to have that whole setup copied to the other machines
[09:13] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Perhaps ask if there is a way you could get all packages installed AFTER the installation is finished, as a text-list
[09:13] <Flannel> Shaba1: you could make your own ISO, or... do some scripting
[09:14] <Shaba1> In windows I would just ghost the HD to a network share and then tell those machines to boot from network in bios
[09:14] <Flannel> Shaba1: you can do that in ubuntu too.
[09:14] <zerotime> Stormx2, sorry if I am a bit slower, I am using beryl, if I go to themes, where you point me to go,
[09:14] <Shaba1> I am burning iso disk as we speak Flannel
[09:14] <Flannel> !install | Shaba1, it's one of the ones here.
[09:14] <ubotu> Shaba1, it's one of the ones here.: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install?

[09:14] <Akuma_> what happens in the boot process after logging in?
[09:14] <zerotime> and change the theme, nothing happens
[09:14] <Shaba1> Just do not want to have to take them all around to 25 machines
[09:15] <Flannel> Shaba1: are you burning the Alternate CD?

[09:15] <LjL> no, just tab completion not working due to user having quit
[09:15] <foob> i always join at the best times
[09:16] <Flannel> Shaba1: yeah, instead of the Desktop ISO.  Alternate boots you straight into an installer
[09:16] <pike_> gah my boss just walked by..
[09:16] <[ginge] > hrmf, i'm a bit confused I've already installed apache2, it's literally one bit that's baffling me which is mapping the conf.d file so it looks at a different dir so I dont have to use the var/www/ dir which means I've gotta set permissions for everything it seems.
[09:16] <Stormx2> pike_: IRC at work? How dare you!
[09:17] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Its a text-install version. No GUI.
[09:17] <Shaba1> aha flannel
[09:17] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Just as easy to use in my opinion, tho
[09:17] <Flannel> [ginge] : that's editing your sites: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default (is the default one)
[09:17] <foob> how can i access my ubuntu partition's files from within my windows partition?
[09:17] <paranoia16> where can i read about games for ubuntu? where are a lot of free ubuntu games? and how hard is it to get age of empires 2 to work in it?
[09:18] <Flannel> !games | paranoia16, here's some list-sorts-of-things
[09:18] <ubotu> paranoia16, here's some list-sorts-of-things: Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[09:18] <Shaba1> Not a problem with that Flannel. I come form the old Altair 5000/Vax/vms days
[09:18] <Stormx2> foob: You need an ext3 driver
[09:18] <Shaba1> but then how would I get that iso to install over a network on a blank hD machne?
[09:19] <Cyber_Stalker> hey guys
[09:19] <NeF_za> Hey, I've tried installing ubuntu 5.10 and 6.10 plus tried using the ubuntu 5.10 live disk. Not very far into the installation process, I get a message saying that X server is unable to start and that I must reconfig my gdm. I have no idea what to do.
[09:19] <Stormx2> !install | Shaba1

[09:19] <Stormx2> Shaba1: Listed there I think
[09:19] <Cyber_Stalker> !bored
[09:19] <Cyber_Stalker> :P
[09:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bored - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:19] <foob> Stormx2 when i try to find that i only see things like ext2fs
[09:19] <Cyber_Stalker> i dont know what else to install on my system
[09:19] <serioussven> any mplayer geeks here who know how to make mplayer run videos smooth?
[09:19] <Stormx2> foob: Whats wrong with ext2fs?
[09:19] <foob> does it work with ext3?
[09:19] <Cyber_Stalker> i got unreal ircd running, anope services for it, pure-ftpd and apacher all running
[09:20] <foob> serioussven install flash9 instead of flash7 plugin
[09:20] <Stormx2> NeF_za: The installation of which? 6.10 or 5.10?
[09:20] <Cyber_Stalker> apache*
[09:20] <serioussven> thanks foob, mplayer for mkv/divx
[09:20] <Stormx2> NeF_za: Yeah it works with ext3
[09:20] <serioussven> foob: I installed the beta allready in the browsers but it's got nothing to do with flash :)
[09:21] <foob> flash7 screws up multimedia in ubuntu all together though
[09:21] <danl_> Is there a way to disable the search domain in network settings, everytime I connect to my wireless router it re-adds belkin as the search domain... this causes a major delay in accessing any internet resource for some reason
[09:21] <NeF> Stormx2 : doesnt work for both, gives same error, i want 6.10 to work
[09:21] <foob> made my movies play all slow in mplayer
[09:21] <NeF> Stormx2 ext3?
[09:21] <foob> nef i think he meant to say that to me
[09:21] <[ginge] > Flannel: So instead of using this link http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_map_URLs_to_folders_outside_.2Fvar.2Fwww.2F All I've gotta do is in that file you just stated open it with a sudo gedit cmd and change the line where it says DocumentRoot /var/www with /home/james/WebDev/?
[09:22] <serioussven> foob: I haven't installed the software, just the plugin in the browser... it's not playing slow, just has slight performance issues
[09:22] <Stormx2> NeF: wrong person, sorry
[09:22] <NeF> o lol
[09:22] <NeF> :P
[09:22] <Stormx2> foob: Comment I addressed to NeF was meant for you.
[09:22] <prxq> Hi. I get "not enough memory to load specified kernel" from the ubuntu dapper mini-iso. Thing is, this computer has enough memory. Any ideas?
[09:22] <serioussven> no mplayer experts here? ;)
[09:22] <Stormx2> NeF: How did you get the CDs? Download and Burn?
[09:23] <K1GPL> here is my tip on mplayer:  use vlc
[09:23] <Stormx2> VLC = Win
[09:23] <michaelfavia> which minipci wireless card has a brighter future and is better supported Dell 1390 or Intel 3945?
[09:23] <michaelfavia> the dell is broadcom based..
[09:23] <NeF> Stormx2 : i dled the 6.10 from the ubuntu site
[09:23] <serioussven> I think VLC is for linux aswel, but I just want to make MPlayer run videos smooth
[09:23] <michaelfavia> bcm43xx
[09:23] <Stormx2> NeF: The Desktop CD or the Alternative CD?
[09:23] <Cyber_Stalker> NeF are you sure it was ubuntu desktop
[09:24] <Cyber_Stalker> Stormx2 just a hunch, but i think he downloaded the alternate :P
[09:24] <Cyber_Stalker> if it boots to console
[09:25] <Akuma_> ubuntu isn't loading after the login prompt. could anyone at least tell me what's supposed to happen at that point so i can do some research? is it x-window? gnome?
[09:26] <foob> gdm/gnome
[09:26] <Stormx2> NeF: When you load the 6.10 CD, do you get a prompt which says like "Just hit enter to install", or does it boot into an environment where you can use the mouse and click "Install"?
[09:26] <NeF> I dled the desktop one, i got the image from the link that said " CD Image for desktop and laptop PCs"
[09:26] <nael> hello, how do i upgrade from an old version of ubuntu? i have an ancient one and would like to upgrade to LTS
[09:26] <Cyber_Stalker> nael upgrading isnt the best route :/
[09:26] <Stormx2> NeF: And does it boot fully, until you get to the state I just described?
[09:26] <Akuma_> foob: thanks. are there common causes for it not booting all of a sudden?
[09:26] <michaelfavia> Akewa, you get the gdm login graphic though?
[09:26] <Cyber_Stalker> fresh installs do good
[09:27] <Stormx2> nael: What version do you have?
[09:27] <foob> Akuma_ dunno never happened to me
[09:27] <Cyber_Stalker> !upgrade
[09:27] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[09:27] <kikokos> hi i have a quest
[09:27] <NeF> Stormx2 : i get to a basic menu, u cant use a mouse, it asked to 1- start/install ubuntu 2- start the graphics in safe mode and i cant remeber the rest of the options
[09:27] <ryancr> A buddy of mine is using dapper on his laptop and has dlink DWL-G650 wireless card, and his signal strength is always really low, anyone know if its common with that card, and if so is there a better card to use with dapper?
[09:27] <Akuma_> foob: how can i boot it manually. say i want to boot it on tty7 from tty1
[09:28] <Cyber_Stalker> NeF, you hit 1
[09:28] <Cyber_Stalker> and it boots to a desktop doesnt it?
[09:28] <Stormx2> NeF: And when you go to Start/Install, what happens?
[09:28] <Cyber_Stalker> it should boot to a normal ubuntu desktop, and there should be an icon on the desktop titled "Install" and it has an arrow pointing to a pic of a hard drive
[09:28] <nael> it is 4.10 :/
[09:29] <nael> update manager doesn't show how to actually go to LTS
[09:29] <Stormx2> ryancr: I doubt dapper has any say in how fast the card is
[09:29] <Stormx2> ryancr: Its probably calculating the strength wrong.
[09:29] <Stormx2> nael: Eek, you're missing out homie.
[09:29] <[ginge] > Hiya Flannel many thanks for helping me with my apache2 proble, I've just fixed it thanks!
[09:29] <NeF> Cyber_Stalker Stormx2 : when i hit the 1st one, it loads some stuff for awhile then a message appears saying "unable to start X server (your graphical interface) try reconfiging ur gdm"
[09:29] <foob> akuma i forget the exact path but it's '/path/to/gdm restart' (or start) i think. i think the path is /etc/init.d/  type 'which gdm' to find out (im in windows right now :/)
[09:29] <nael> so how to i get to LTS from hoary?
[09:29] <ryancr> Stormx2: well sites etc load slow as well
[09:29] <danl_> is there a way to force the dhcp on a wireless connection to ignore the assigned dns server?
[09:29] <Stormx2> NeF: Okay. How did you download your .iso file, torrent or normally?
[09:29] <mc44> nael: you have to upgrade via breezy then to dapper
[09:30] <jrib> nael: you have to go through all the upgrades in between.  It would probably be faster to just install a fresh dapper
[09:30] <NeF> Stormx2 : normally
[09:30] <Akuma_> foob: usr/sbin/gdm
[09:30] <Cyber_Stalker> NeF normal http download right
[09:30] <Cyber_Stalker> ?
[09:30] <Cyber_Stalker> have you run the "check cd" option?
[09:30] <braindead_moron> I installed the emprorer linux kernel .deb and it works great... However I didn't install the empconfig.deb and now I can't use apt as every time I do it complains I need to "fix" it (the empkernel dependency on empconfig).  Is there a way to tell APT to just forget about empconfig and that I like it this way?
[09:30] <NeF> yes Cyber_Stalker
[09:30] <ryancr> Stormx2: and if he goes closer to the router the signal does increase
[09:30] <Cyber_Stalker> NeF to which all of the checks came up as [ok] ?
[09:31] <jrib> braindead_moron: use equivs
[09:31] <Stormx2> NeF: It could be one of three things. 1) The ISO you downloaded didn't get downloaded completely/properly. 2) The CD you burnt was a bad burn 3) Ubuntu genuinly can't handle your video setup
[09:31] <spacing_guild> what's the command to get xine to auto-play a dvd?
[09:31] <h0ndaracer2> is this anything to be worried about Checking `sniffer'... lo: not promisc and no packet sniffer sockets etho PACKET SNIFFER(/sbin/dhclient3[3277] )
[09:31] <h0ndaracer2> i ran chkrootchk or whatever its called
[09:31] <Cyber_Stalker> ryancr its probably a card related issues
[09:31] <Cyber_Stalker> issue*
[09:31] <ryancr> Cyber_Stalker: do you have a suggestion for a better supported card?
[09:32] <NeF> Cyber_Stalker one thing doesnt come up as ok, i cant remeber what it said though
[09:32] <Stormx2> NeF: Please boot the CD, and on the initial menu, select "Check CD for defects", and press enter.
[09:32] <NeF> Stormx2 and Cyber_Stalker : ty
[09:32] <Cyber_Stalker> ryancr its the actual hardware giving a problem in my opinion
[09:32] <atIantis> has anyone had problems install vmware workstation? evrey time i try to run it, it says it needs to be reconfigured...
[09:32] <malt1> when i create a linux account on the system, how can i get it not to add everyone with ssh access, or how what file do i go in to remove a user from ssh?
[09:32] <h0ndaracer2> my os is been slugish lately
[09:32] <braindead_moron> jrib: But the empkernel was a .deb... I don't need to make one for it.  Unless you are implying a make a "dummy" empconfig to satisfy the requirement?
[09:33] <jrib> braindead_moron: yes, that's what I am implying
[09:33] <Cyber_Stalker> NeF boot the CD and run the "check for errors option"
[09:33] <Cyber_Stalker> NeF i have seen people say that writing the disk at slower speeds solves the issue
[09:33] <^Caracal^> Could a nice kind person help out a semi-noob here please? it's about trying to get a resolution/refresh rate working (tried almost everything) thanks!
[09:33] <Cyber_Stalker> i think i saw one person say 4x
[09:33] <ryancr> Cyber_Stalker: do you mean the actual card is the problem?
[09:33] <Riyonuk> how much storage is needed to isntall ubuntu on a usb?
[09:33] <Cyber_Stalker> but i think
[09:33] <NeF> awesome thanks
[09:33] <Riyonuk> will 256mb do it?
[09:33] <jrib> braindead_moron: I guess your other option is to rebuild the package without the dependency
[09:33] <Shaba1> Stormx2 - PriceChild AND Flannel THANKS ALOT!
[09:33] <Cyber_Stalker> ryancr yes, i think it might just be a dodgey/broken card
[09:34] <braindead_moron> There is no apt or dpkg command to tell it to just ignore the dependency?
[09:34] <Shaba1> You three have gotten me started in the right direction
[09:34] <Cyber_Stalker> but ryancr thats just my opinion :P as signal strength is not normally related to wht OS ure running
[09:34] <Stormx2> Shaba1: No prob.
[09:34] <braindead_moron> jrib: Because of course I'd need to apt-get install equivs
[09:34] <Shaba1> this should be fairly easy now
[09:34] <ryancr> Cyber_Stalker: ok do you know of a better supported card that may work better with ubuntu
[09:34] <Shaba1> but I WILL be back to ask more question
[09:34] <nael>  Change your repositories to look for Breezy : how do i do that
[09:34] <Shaba1> BTW Stormx2 www.kixtart.org
[09:35] <kameron> i need to setup a tightvnc server like REALLY REALLY quick, because i have to leave in 20 mins. any experts lend a hand real quick??
[09:35] <ryancr> Cyber_Stalker: yes that makes sense
[09:35] <Shaba1> Look at that
[09:35] <PriceChild> Shaba1, no problem :)
[09:35] <foob> i installed ext2-fsd and then mounted my linux ext3 partition with it and when i click on the drive letter for linux/ext3 in windows explorer it asks me 'the drive has not been formatted yet do you want to format it?' why would it do that? if i format it i will lose all my data :/
[09:35] <Stormx2> nael: Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list.
[09:35] <Cyber_Stalker> lol ryancr its not that a card will work better with ubuntu, get a better quality card maybe :P
[09:35] <braindead_moron> which is gonna make me do a apt-get -f install first, which is gonna remove my kernel
[09:35] <Stormx2> nael: replace hoary with breezy
[09:35] <Shaba1> Really nice logon scripting language for windows
[09:35] <atIantis> anyone have VMWare workstation instllaed?
[09:35] <jrib> braindead_moron: I don't know of a way to make it ignore the dep other than those two ways
[09:35] <nael> could i do that in the gui?
[09:35] <Stormx2> nael: I don't recommend it tho. I suggest you backup your data and do a fresh install of edgy
[09:35] <Cyber_Stalker> Stormx2 i think nef is trying to dual boot ;/
[09:36] <ryancr> Cyber_Stalker: thats what I mean I know not all pcimcia cards are supported under linux, so I wanted to find a model of one that seemed to be working the best
[09:36] <^Caracal^> anyone?
[09:36] <Cyber_Stalker> oh ryancr im not sure on supported cards, i dont ure wireless, i use a bridged connection to my windows box
[09:36] <Cyber_Stalker> !wireless
[09:36] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:36] <Riyonuk> Ok, since no one answered my previous question, Ill ask another one. Whats the best way to partition? Partition magic? Default Windows one? The Ubuntu one?
[09:36] <jrib> braindead_moron: apt-get has an ignore-missing switch you can use to get equiv I think
[09:36] <ryancr> ah ok, thanks for your help
[09:37] <Cyber_Stalker> np ryancr

[09:40] <^Caracal^> well, either that or the nvidia drivers.... or ubuntu!

[09:41] <mc44> spacing_guild: xine --auto-play --auto-scan  dvd ?
[09:42] <To1> anyone know the command for a direct dvd copy, i wanna write a bash script to copy my holiday vids
[09:42] <mc44> spacing_guild_: ^^
[09:42] <spacing_guild_> mc44: for the win. Thanks!
[09:42] <miyako> To1 - are you wanting to copy an iso or conver to a divx or what?
[09:42] <mc44> spacing_guild_: man xine :)
[09:43] <spacing_guild_> mc44: another quick one then, how do I set xine to be the default player?
[09:43] <To1> just copy one dvd to another
[09:43] <Cyber_Stalker> not cool :/
[09:44] <miyako> To1 - can't look up the exact command, but if they are just your holiday videos and aren't DRMed, you should be able to use dd if=/dev/dvd (or whatever) of=~/homemovies.iso then burn the iso
[09:45] <miyako> but you'll have to look up the proper blocksize
[09:45] <mjr> it'll work without explicit blocksize
[09:46] <miyako> mjr - ah, I wasn't sure off the top of my head

[09:48] <mc44> spacing_guild_: nautilus is the file manager in ubuntu
[09:48] <mjr> AfterDeath, use mplayer's esd driver and direct it to your local esd server which you must make sure will accept connections from that host. Don't recall the details.

[10:02] <Everflex> What is the commad to analyze free, used and total disk space etc.?
[10:02] <ThePub> mrlinux: if you're looking to be more "secure", then what you need is not to hide it from "ls -a" but a better console to log your user into, instead of a vanilla bash session.

[10:10] <umsteiger> mrlinux yes, I had this idea already, but would have prefered a free solution
[10:10] <ThePub> ^Caracal^: I'm just guess here btw.. but I really doubt DPMS and modeline configurations mix since the X server will probe and ultimately select the first available mode which would be 60Hz

[10:10] <mrlinux> umsteiger, check  http://www.tucows.com

[10:14] <h0ndaracer2> if i run update manager should that cover every update so i dont have to do any updating throught the comman line
[10:14] <paranoia16> is there a "default" place a program puts its icons?

[10:16] <jrib> x-r00t-x: are you sure it isn't installed already?
[10:16] <ThePub> x-r00t-x: venturing a guess here, but with the old debian installations there was a directory in /etc/apache/modules-available
[10:16] <jrib> x-r00t-x: try 'sudo a2enmod'
[10:16] <x-r00t-x> jrib, i am not sure
[10:17] <ThePub> x-r00t-x: what you do is go to /etc/apache/modules-enabled and make a link from /etc/apache/modules-availble to there with the module you want.  which is cgi in this case.
[10:17] <x-r00t-x> Module name? cgi
[10:17] <x-r00t-x> This module is already enabled!
[10:17] <jrib> ThePub: a2enmod automates that for you now :)
[10:17] <x-r00t-x> thank you guys :D

[10:19] <rance> I need some help with a problem, I've lost the ability to sudo commands, sudo reports an error saying that the hostname can not be found, I know what the problem is, and can explain it, but not sure how to fix it
[10:19] <steven_> hi , what partition should i take to make a STORAGE disk ?
[10:20] <Music_Shuffle> Night Cyber_Stalker
[10:20] <jrib> rogue780: I was trying to let you know that you could /msg him, didn't really want to threaten you with angry ops
[10:20] <jrib> steven_: an empty one?
[10:20] <steven_> jrib: yes
[10:20] <jrib> steven_: yeah, use an empty partition :)
[10:20] <steven_> how i make it :p cant be mounted
[10:21] <jrib> steven_: use gparted to format it
[10:21] <steven_> its terminal only
[10:21] <jrib> steven_: parted then
[10:21] <steven_> installing
[10:22] <jrib> (I have no idea how to use it)
[10:22] <umsteiger> h0ndaracer2: You don'T need to worry that (I think) ,,, it tells the loopback interface cannot be turned into promiscous mode, which is absolutly normal for loopback ... you are not on a network-segment and thus cannot capture packets not adress to your computer from there
[10:22] <jrib> rance: show us the contents of /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
[10:22] <EdLin> steven_: be warned, parted does not ask you "are you sure" when you make a change.
[10:22] <Music_Shuffle> lol
[10:22] <h0ndaracer2> thanks for the help i was just wondering what do you do if it finds something tho
[10:22] <steven_> oke
[10:23] <Waappu> Hi. Could you help me please. I can't get sound from Hauppauge pvr pci. All cables are right place and anything isn't muted on mixed. No sound even I plug headpones to board audio output
[10:24] <ThePub> rance: if you know what the issue is, why not restart the machine into administration mode.. or whatever it's called at the grub prompt?
[10:24] <steven_> Start? what should i type ? like euh , yes or start ?
[10:24] <steven_> whit parted
[10:24] <umsteiger> h0ndaracer2: It cannot sniff any packets on loopback ... it can sniff on your w55whatever and if it finds something there, you might be in trouble
[10:25] <ThePub> rance: single-user mode shouldn't require a password, you can fix any issue, then "init 2" to get back to multi-user mode.
[10:25] <mascanho> anyone having problems with nvidia drivers changing screen resolution ??
[10:26] <steven_> jrib: Start? what should i type ? like euh , yes or start ? and how i start it then so i makes my ext2 partition ? just quit ,
[10:26] <coopster> i have an issue that's not exactly ubuntu specific, but i use ubuntu and i need someone to point me in the right direction if they could.  my hard drive used to work with no problems, and now the BIOS will no longer recognize that the drive is connected.  what are the first steps (if any) that i can try before spending money i dont have for recovery specialists?
[10:26] <jrib> steven_: like I said, I have no idea how to use it, sorry
[10:26] <steven_> k
[10:26] <steven_> and EdLin ?
[10:27] <Music_Shuffle> coopster, try i another machine.
[10:27] <Music_Shuffle> in*
[10:27] <jrib> steven_: you might be able to just use the mkfs command too.  These are things I'm just suggesting so you can find some info about them
[10:27] <Music_Shuffle> Just because....if the BIOS is the problem on your current machine's board, you might get lucky with another machine.
[10:27] <y2u> ver irc.azzurra.net
[10:27] <umsteiger> h0ndaracer2: If it finds something, then the box is definatly lost, the only *secure* way to take back control over the box is too wipe the platterns
[10:27] <coopster> Music_Shuffle: i have installed it in another machine, BIOS recognized it once, wouldnt boot (because I never set the other HD in the machine up fully) and hasn't recognized the HD after that boot
[10:27] <DARKILER> CAPAB DARKILER-MSG
[10:28] <DARKILER> Bonjour !
[10:28] <rance> coopster: if the bios recognized the hard drive yesterday, and doesnt today, you might have loose cables, make sure the power and data cables to the drive are seated properly and see if the bios recognizes the drive

[10:29] <stephan1> Hi, I have a toshiba tecra A3 laptop with xp pro and I have installed ubuntu 6.06 in june with grub as a bootloader. No problem untill last week and now I can boot on ubuntu but no more on windows. Grub seems OK but when I choose XP I have : NTLDR manque (=missing), press ctrl=alt+suppr for reboot.
[10:29] <Moosejaw> hey all..i used deborphan recently and i think it fawked my dir /usr/share/app-install/icons
[10:29] <Music_Shuffle> @ coopster
[10:29] <Moosejaw> is there a way to fix this?
[10:30] <Robokop> is there a way i can add a boot option in grub so i can just start enough to play music (so no X and Networking etc)
[10:30] <coopster> Music_Shuffle: no, it doesn't work in any machine.  the second machine recognized it once, but then it wouldn't again.  now, in both machines, the BIOS will not auto detect.  i set the bios to manual and put in the specs, but that didnt work either
[10:30] <stephan1> I cheched NTLDR.dll with comp in a windows console and it seems OK
[10:30] <Music_Shuffle> The drive's gone perhaps?
[10:30] <Robokop> stephan1: recently had vista installed?
[10:30] <Music_Shuffle> Does the BIOS recognize OTHER drives if you put them in?
=== chorse_ is now known as chorse
[10:31] <coopster> i'm somewhat grasping at straws, it doesn't seem good, but i have been short-sighted with backups and i really don't want to lose my software that i'm developing. =/
[10:31] <stephan1> Does anybodyknows about that ?
[10:31] <coopster> Music_Shuffle: yes
[10:31] <diezare> Guys, while I was checking for new updates I recived the following error "W: GPG error: http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org edgy Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 3FF0DB166A7476EA" Any Ideas?
[10:31] <Music_Shuffle> If the BIOS runs other drives, its the drive. >_<.
[10:31] <Music_Shuffle> Err wait.
[10:31] <jrib> stephan1: try ##windows
[10:31] <Music_Shuffle> coopster, when you put it in another machine, was it the master drive still?
[10:32] <coopster> Music_Shuffle: yes
[10:32] <Music_Shuffle> coopster, change it as run it as a slave.

[10:32] <Music_Shuffle> The boot sector might just be messed.
[10:32] <mc44> diezare: yes, you dont have the right gpg key for that repository, but its only a warning and doesnt stop updates
[10:32] <Music_Shuffle> And then you might be able to move stuff off if its slaved.
[10:32] <stephan1> Thanks jrib but what do you mean by this ?
[10:32] <Robokop> stephan1: there shouldn't be a NTLDR.dll but just a NTLDR in the root of C
[10:32] <Music_Shuffle> Perhaps not all of it, but y'know...some stuff > no stuff. Lol.
[10:32] <touchscreen> Okay, and if my device is not listed in the lsusb, is there a way to make linux see it?
[10:32] <Robokop> is there a way i can add a boot option in grub so i can just start enough to play music (so no X and Networking etc)
[10:32] <diezare> mc44, how can I get the right gpg?
[10:32] <coopster> Music_Shuffle: heh, i agree.  i'll try switching the jumper and see if that helps
[10:33] <jrib> stephan1: ##windows is a channel on freenode for windows support, just type this in your client to join:  /join ##windows

[10:33] <coopster> Music_Shuffle:  thanks
[10:33] <stephan1> robokop OK I checked the wrong one in i386

[10:34] <Robokop> the other
[10:35] <stephan1> robokop how to get it
[10:35] <meaning> hello here
[10:35] <coopster> Music_Shuffle: should i actually attach it on the same cable as another IDE (cd-rom drive) and switch it to slave, or just switch it to slave and leave it on its own cable?
[10:35] <stephan1> in C:
[10:35] <rance> can someone point me in the right direction for a problem, I recently upgraded dhcp client on a server box,  upon reboot the custom dhclient.conf file Im using is apparently not being read.  I have some supersede lines that are not making their way to my box after dhcp client setup
[10:35] <s_v_e_n> Im having a problem with debootstrap - its not going to do the complete installation and fails with:    W: Failure trying to run: chroot /mnt/dest mount -t proc proc /proc      - ANY Ideas ?
[10:35] <meaning> could anyone tell me how to get the video i play from vlc full screen on my hdtv?
[10:36] <diezare> mc44, does it take long time?
[10:36] <meaning> am I obliged to configure twinview ?
[10:36] <Music_Shuffle> coopster, Umm, might as well try both ways, and see if it works either way.
[10:36] <Music_Shuffle> WCS, you have to do it twice.
[10:36] <rance> this is a problem as sudo no longer works without hostname resolution which was provided via a domain-name-servers supersede
[10:36] <Music_Shuffle> It should be ok with the CD though.
[10:36] <g443d> what encryption are being used to encryp the password into the shadow file?
[10:36] <Robokop> stephan1: rename that file to NTLDR and it should be fine
[10:37] <mc44> diezare: no it shouldnt
[10:37] <stephan1> robokop without any extension ? and where do i put it ?

[10:40] <lavid> mc44: okay, that makes sense, but compiling WINE in 64bits doesn't mean that it is supporting only 32bit apps, right?

[10:44] <lavid> mc44: I understand that, but since the AMD64/EMT64 architectures can natively run 32bit apps, shouldn't WINE also work? I suppose the ideal would be a 64bit compiled WINE, but if that isn't possible/useful/stable, a 32 bit version on an AMD64/EM64T should be fine, right?

[10:52] <lavid> as I see it, there are 3 modes WINE can be in when running an app: WINE compiled in 64bits, running a 32bit app, WINE in 32bits running a 32bit app and WINE in 64bits running a 64bit app. Since WINE is a compatibility layer, it can leave the CPU instructions alone, and move around 64bit data when it needs to. whatever... this isn't the WINEdev channel. My question is: shouldn't the ability to install 32bit WINE be OOTB?
[10:52] <Sumit> yep, it starts it,
[10:53] <mc44> lavid: it isnt because ubuntu doesnt have multiarch
[10:53] <Sumit> but its taking way toooo long, so i skip to test 10
[10:53] <Sumit> rite now its running till 400%
[10:54] <lavid> mc44: huh?
[10:55] <FlyingSquirrel32> when  I use the LiveCD, sometimes I want to access the hard drive. What devices should I look for. I know somtimes there's /dev/hda1 or sda. are there any others?
[10:55] <cyphase> Does anyone here use F-Spot to manage more then just photos, i.e. backgrounds, etc.
[10:55] <HymnToLife> FlyingSquirrel32, fdisk -l as root will tell you
[10:55] <Sumit> nah this is not working out, laters
[10:55] <dave> question, i wanna set a LOT of avi files to be converted to mpg while im away, i tried using |'s but it does them all at once, is there a way i can giev it a command that will do them all one after anohter?

[10:56] <FlyingSquirrel32> HymnToLife: great thanks
[10:56] <HymnToLife> dave > commant1 && command2 && command3 && ...
[10:56] <dave> ahh cool thanks
[10:56] <graft> dave or for loop
[10:57] <chitresh> hi
[10:57] <HymnToLife> or a bash script with a loop indeed but that might be a little too much
[10:57] <coopster> gotta go with the for loop
[10:57] <lavid> mc44: so the deb kids are on that one?
[10:57] <graft> yeah, it's worth learning that, anyway
[10:57] <mc44> lavid: yes, but...
[10:57] <graft> for loops are incredibly handy shell tools
[10:58] <coopster> off topic, does anyone know of a good, preferrably cheap, hard drive recovery company?

[10:58] <graft> anyone know how I can get elinks working with javascript?
[10:59] <foob> Galga type uname -a
[10:59] <lavid> coopster: but, try the tips on this site:http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33495
[10:59] <dave> sweet thanks
[10:59] <lupine_85> graft: links2 does, IIIRC
[10:59] <Galga> oh thats great foob, but i m using windows right now. i need to know that version so that i can download appropriate internal modem drivers
[11:00] <Galga> perhaps there is a default kernel version distributed with 6.10 ?
[11:00] <mc44> lavid: i.e. its unlikely to happen any time soon
[11:00] <foob> Version 6.10 ships with the 2.6.17 kernel and GNOME 2.16

[11:01] <graft> woop woop woop woop!
[11:01] <graft> thanks lupine_85
[11:01] <foob> for Galga
[11:01] <Galga> foo thanks
[11:01] <sedra> what's the version of xgl on ubuntu 6.10
[11:01] <lavid> mc44: yeah, I gathered from the post :-/ anything I might be able to do so speed that up? I think it's pretty important, at least for AMD64/EM64T running 32bit apps nativley
[11:02] <mc44> !info xgl edgy
[11:02] <ubotu> Package xgl does not exist in edgy

[11:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sonypi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:02] <Galga> foob kernel version 2.6.15-27 means, the driver will be compatible from versions 2.6.15 to 2.6.27 ?
[11:02] <paul0> gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory

[11:03] <jamesb_> xsnow won't snow - nothing happens for me, neither on Breezy at work or edgy at home - any help appreciated - extremely important app this week :-D
[11:04] <sedra> it is optional package!!
[11:04] <mc44> lavid: from that thread it seems to be a low priority
[11:04] <mc44> sedra: yes
[11:04] <paul0> graft: oh, no
[11:04] <lavid> mc44: yeah, I see that, and I don't think it should be, so I want to help implement it
[11:04] <paul0> graft: why i should have cpp and g++? they're not the same thing?
[11:04] <graft> paul0: um, how are you trying to build things?
[11:05] <mc44> lavid: well debian would seem the best place to help out, although it is not a simple problem to fix
[11:05] <lavid> mc44: then, regardless of the priority level, if it's all ready to go, it'll get thrown in anyways
[11:05] <paul0> graft: i've made an test.cpp file, then gcc test.cpp
[11:05] <graft> paul0: by cpp you mean c++?
[11:06] <paul0> graft: anything that compiles c++ code
[11:06] <EdLin> paul0: if you want to be sure to compile c++ code, use the g++ command.
[11:06] <graft> paul0: gcc = gnu c compiler. use g++ to compile c++
[11:06] <EdLin> graft++
[11:06] <paul0> graft: is working now, thanks =)
[11:06] <graft> coo
[11:06] <graft> yo, how come it isn't snowing on my desktop?
[11:06] <paul0> graft: and the cpp package, it is for what?
[11:07] <EdLin> graft: xsnow?
[11:07] <graft> cpp = c pre-processor
[11:07] <graft> EdLin: yeah, seems to do nothing
[11:07] <lavid> mc44: oh, I'm sure it's not trivial
[11:07] <paul0> oh, right
[11:07] <EdLin> graft: in GNOME and KDE, the root window is covered by the wallpaper.
[11:07] <paul0> thanks graft, and EdLin
[11:07] <EdLin> paul0: np
[11:07] <jamesb_> EdLin: is that the cause of my not seeing xsnow?
[11:08] <rambo3> xsnoow
[11:08] <EdLin> jamesb_: yep. Nautilus is putting something else there.
=== Hawk||- is now known as Hawk|afk
[11:08] <graft> EdLin: um, ought it not to snow on windows as well?
[11:09] <EdLin> graft: xsnow, if that's what you're using, puts the snow and some other animation on the root window.
[11:09] <mc44> graft: if you have beryl you can get snow :)
[11:09] <jamesb_> so where do I remove the wallpaper? - searching...
[11:09] <jamesbrose> How can I make a harddrive mount @ boot? What do i need to put in the fstab if the hd is located at /dev/hdc1 ?
[11:09] <EdLin> I don't know anything about Beryl.
[11:09] <VirtualInsanity> hi there
[11:09] <EdLin> jamesbrose: I think Nautilus is in charge of that - and way too many other things.
[11:09] <tubo^bph> evening all
[11:10] <rambo3> jamesb_, yeah no xsnow here too
[11:10] <jamesbrose> EdLin, so how would I configure it to do that?
[11:10] <mc44> jamesbrose: what is the file system of the drive?
[11:10] <EdLin> jamesbrose: I don't know.
[11:10] <jamesbrose> ext2, mc44
[11:10] <jamesbrose> the default linux one, mc44
[11:11] <EdLin> jamesbrose: I don't even know if you can tell it to leave the root window alone, the only time it does that here is if it crashes and takes the wallpaper with it.
[11:11] <prxq> any way to install ubuntu over an usb network?
[11:11] <mc44> !fstab | jamesbrose
[11:11] <ubotu> jamesbrose: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[11:11] <jamesb_> xsnow is essential - I've used it since Solaris 2.3! I've even got Desktop -> Background "No picture" (KDE) set, but no xsnow!
[11:11] <EdLin> jamesb_: the darned thing still is painting over the root window then.
[11:11] <EdLin> jamesb_: and I thought I was an old-timer for starting with a shell on a Microport SysV system.
[11:12] <VirtualInsanity> is it a known problem that ubuntu won't finish booting on certain notebooks?
[11:12] <ircleuser> yeah! I managed my first IRC!!!!!!
[11:12] <wilee85> is there a way to search every fiile's content for a specific word?
[11:12] <wilee85> ircleuser, Glorious Huzzah!
[11:13] <VirtualInsanity> or, even better, can someone offer a solution
[11:13] <tubo^bph> VirtualInsanity, this could be for 100000 reasons. More details please
[11:13] <mc44> wilee85: you can use grep to search files for words
[11:13] <jamesb_> EdLin: :-) But that stil doesn't mean I understand or can keep up with all the new stuff - at least MWM works ;-)
[11:13] <EdLin> wilee85: if you can narrow it down to a set of files it could be practical, otherwise you'd better either have a fast hard-drive or a lot of patience
[11:13] <wilee85> mc44, I'm kind  of a news....could you elaborate?
[11:13] <EdLin> jamesb_: fvwm > MWM
[11:14] <wilee85> EdLin, it wold be a conf file most likely
[11:14] <usr_rob> "ATi Mobility Radeon X1400 128MB Semi-shared PCI Express" what does PCI express stand for? Is it possible to upgrade? I know what Mini-pci are, but PCI Express ?
[11:14] <mc44> wilee85: what are you looking for?
[11:14] <EdLin> jamesb_: unless you love xresource files
[11:14] <HymnToLife> usr_rob, wikipedia knows ;)
[11:14] <jamesb_> EdLin: yeah, and mwm > twm
[11:14] <EdLin> jamesb_: true.
[11:14] <dredhammer> is it good idea to update to the latest build of gnome? Will this mess up Dapper in anyway?
[11:14] <Lunglet> hello all... new user here... what is the equivalent of jpackage.org for debian/ubuntu? i want to install maven2 and friends
[11:15] <EdLin> jamesb_: though I've used twm on a regular basis at one time, it can actually be made to look halfway decent.
[11:15] <VirtualInsanity> my hardware: Acer TravelMate 4602; graphics must be ATI mobility Radeon x600 oder x700, the system boots on rescue-mode but a normal boot (and install, too. i used the text-installer) ends in a black display, only way out is a reboot
[11:15] <jamesb_> xsetroot -grey didn't remove the wallpaper either
[11:15] <mc44> dredhammer: I would upgrade to Edgy if you want newer gnome
[11:15] <wilee85> I'm looking for /ds in some file that is making it be apache2's document root. I've changed /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, as well as ...../sites-availble/default files...restarted apache2, but to no avail
[11:15] <tubo^bph> VirtualInsanity, did you check the logs?
[11:15] <wilee85> mc44, ^
[11:15] <HymnToLife> Lunglet, please explain wht is jpackage.org
[11:15] <dredhammer> isn't edgy sort of bleeding edge?
[11:15] <Lunglet> hymntolife: java packages built into rpms
[11:15] <EdLin> jamesb_: then it's painting the root window.
[11:15] <VirtualInsanity> which logs can help here? i really have not a bit of an idea about x.org
[11:16] <tubo^bph> dredhammer, not really, feisty is
[11:16] <lavid> dredhammer: feisty is
[11:16] <Lunglet> hymntolife: xerces, maven, ant, everything from apache jakarta, etc.
[11:16] <mc44> dredhammer: upgrading Gnome in Dapper will break many things
[11:16] <dredhammer> oh dear
[11:16] <lavid> VirtualInsanity: /var/logs/Xorg.0.log
[11:17] <EdLin> jamesb_: I just had a fun time with Nautilus crashing from a large graphics file I attempted to use as wallpaper on my 1024x768 screen. It started spawning file managers then crashed.
[11:17] <wilee85> mc44, I'm about to just restart the computer and try the windows solution...but I'm sshed in there and really don't feel like going up two flights of stairs
[11:17] <dredhammer> so then its an Edgy dvd upgrade
[11:17] <usr_rob> HymnToLife: Thx, mate. I got info at #debian.
[11:17] <mc44> wilee85: erm cd to /etc/apache2 and do "less * | grep \/ds" maybe?
[11:18] <lavid> dredhammer: use the cd... no reason to download the DVD
[11:18] <noelferreira> how can i prevent my sytem from start the screensaver when i'm watching movies with totem?
[11:18] <sedra> disable it
[11:19] <EdLin> noelferreira: system > preferences > screen-saver
[11:19] <dredhammer> you never know lavid
[11:19] <dredhammer> what you might need
[11:19] <lavid> dredhammer: no... I think I know this time :-p
[11:19] <wilee85> mc44, is that recursive?
[11:19] <Riyonuk> If I cant seem to boot from a usb no matter what I do, will a usb-hardrive act the same way?
[11:19] <dredhammer> it would beat having to download when its already on the dvd
[11:20] <noelferreira> EdLin: i want it disable only when i'm using totem or mplayer or xine
[11:20] <lavid> dredhammer: not if the package has been updated since the release of Edgy
[11:20] <tubo^bph> noelferreira, write a script
[11:20] <VirtualInsanity> I suggest Fatal Server Error: No Screens Found is the problem here
[11:20] <sedra> Riyonuk: yes
[11:20] <dredhammer> damn it you got me :)
[11:20] <VirtualInsanity> which is also the last line printed in the log
[11:20] <mc44> wilee85: oh possibly not, my command line skills are pretty rubbish, sorry
[11:20] <Riyonuk> sedra, T_T, well, is a usb-hardrive and external hardrive the same thing?
[11:21] <wilee85> as are mine if it isn't DOS based...having kind of a hard time crossing over
[11:21] <wilee85> mc44, ^
[11:21] <nothlit> Theres firewire extertnal hard drives
[11:21] <nothlit> and eSATA
[11:21] <Akuma_> my gnome install is messed up, i think due to a .deb i installed - i'm very stuck. could anyone help out? any clue would be appreciated
[11:21] <Riyonuk> ?
[11:21] <noelferreira> tubo^bph: it is not the screensaver i got a black screen after a few minutes maybe 20
[11:21] <sedra> yes
[11:21] <sedra> the same
[11:21] <Riyonuk> oh
[11:22] <tubo^bph> noelferreira, ah isnt that the DPMS stuff - not sure.
[11:22] <EdLin> noelferreira: GNOME's screensaver has a bug that after sleep mode has been activated it no longer does anything but a blank screen.
[11:22] <EdLin> noelferreira: this is known to the developers.
[11:22] <noelferreira> so what shoul i do?
[11:23] <VirtualInsanity> and there is no error warning before
[11:23] <sedra> disable it
[11:23] <EdLin> noelferreira: deactivate it when you play videos. Either that or hit the shift key every five minutes or so.
[11:23] <noelferreira> so there's no solution at all?
[11:23] <Azalar> anyone got a Logitech Mx1000 mouse working in Linux?
[11:23] <noelferreira> lol
[11:23] <noelferreira> ok
[11:23] <EdLin> noelferreira: not yet.
[11:23] <sedra> that is The SOLUTION
[11:23] <noelferreira> i'll do that
[11:24] <noelferreira> thanks
[11:24] <graft> yo mc44 - how do i get beryl snow?
[11:24] <Riyonuk> Where is the list (if one exists) of..I forget the name, but if I were to buy something, it would automatically work in linux, no drivers needed
[11:24] <EdLin> sedra: you could actually write a script to control xscreensaver with xscreensaver-command, but GNOME when they decided to write their own didn't include that.
[11:24] <tubo^bph> hang on, i happily watched movies by killall gnome-screensaver , that should do fine for you as well noelferreira
[11:24] <mc44> graft: you need the SVN snapshot of beryl
[11:24] <tubo^bph> bit brute force i know, but you could script it
[11:24] <lavid> Azalar: it depends on the level of "working" that you're referring to. Try this: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=219894
[11:25] <graft> mc44: grumble brumgle
[11:25] <graft> mc44: has it got santa claus?
[11:25] <noelferreira> thanks
[11:25] <tubo^bph> open your dvd playing app via a script that kills the screensaver, and restarts it when you exit the dvd player
[11:25] <Riyonuk> ?
[11:25] <EdLin> tubo^bph: how do you script GNOME screensaver in edgy? The old command was xscreensaver-command
[11:25] <mc44> graft: haha no
[11:25] <Azalar> lavid: wanted to get all the buttons working on it, thanks for link
[11:26] <lavid> Azalar: I did try that tutorial, but I get a segfault on the evdev module:-/
[11:26] <Combat_Ferrit> PARRRRTY
[11:26] <tubo^bph> EdLin, possibly lame but i just kill the whole gnome-screensaver process, works for me.
[11:26] <VirtualInsanity> is there still somebody thinking about my problem?
[11:26] <EdLin> tubo^bph: ah, that makes sense.
[11:26] <EdLin> good all killall (except in HP-UX. ;-) )
[11:26] <EdLin> ol'
[11:26] <tubo^bph> EdLin, not elegant but does what i need, and would also work for noelferreira
[11:26] <sedra> what's your pb
[11:26] <asgilder> Anyone have a happauge wintv2000 in their computer?
[11:27] <Azalar> lavid: think i might have tried that one too, seems a bit fiddly to get working
[11:27] <lavid> Azalar: did your evdev module segfault when booting X too?
[11:27] <VirtualInsanity> sedra: crashing xorg while booting on an ati mobility radeon x700. "No Screen Found"

[11:30] <sedra> VirtualInsanity did u installed the binary driver from ATI
[11:30] <tubo^bph> kritical, works for me, but if in doubt use screen
[11:30] <EdLin> Combat_Ferrit: irssi, but that's terminal-only
[11:30] <VirtualInsanity> no i did not
[11:30] <tonyyarusso> kritical: I'm not sure what will happen to your session, but to be safe you could start screen and run it within that; that way if you get disconnected it will still finish running.
[11:30] <dost> wow xchat rocks!

[11:32] <graft> VirtualInsanity: fglrx is what they're called
[11:32] <sedra> install it from the console

[11:32] <sedra> without X session
[11:32] <tonyyarusso> he11_boy: Aaah.  Well, you could change the keymapping for that shortcut - not sure how easy it would be
[11:32] <EdLin> he11_boy: use a screwdriver and pry the printscreen / sysrq key off. ;)
[11:32] <graft> VirtualInsanity: don't install it from the ati website, use the one in the repos
[11:33] <sedra> graft: why?
[11:33] <lavid> coopster: you have the busted HD
[11:33] <tubo^bph> sedra, easier
[11:33] <EdLin> he11_boy: seriously though, you can remap it.
[11:33] <mc44> wilee85: ok here we go "grep -r \/ds /etc/apache2/*
[11:33] <tonyyarusso> he11_boy: Looks pretty easy - System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts, just change take screenshot to something obscure
[11:33] <graft> sedra: because it's easier to install/uninstall
[11:33] <sedra> i installed it from ati
[11:33] <EdLin> tonyyarusso++
[11:33] <graft> sedra: yeah, it works ok, just much less headache this way
[11:33] <tonyyarusso> EdLin: Although yours was more amusing :P
[11:34] <graft> sedra: specially since fglrx overwrites some 3d libs sometimes, can really suck
[11:34] <EdLin> tonyyarusso: heh
[11:34] <he11_boy> xd thanks

[11:37] <VirtualInsanity> fglrx is not found
[11:37] <sharperguy> My dad was ripping CD's all day not noticing what when he installed WMP11 it set the format to wma again (as a pposed to mp3)
