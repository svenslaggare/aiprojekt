[12:01] <semboy> _Dante_  ubuntu dapper is more easy then edgy :( i just cant find the linux-restricted-modules
[12:01] <adaptr> Clarrisa: you can set admi (root) access by adding a line to smb.conf with "admin users = username"
[12:01] <soundray> Clarrisa: I think you have some misconception about what samba is
[12:01] <semboy> _Dante_ i cant find this -> "linux-restricted-modules-amd64-k8"
[12:01] <adaptr> Clarrisa: that will give root perms to that user on the samba shares without him actually being root
[12:02] <Clarrisa> soundray, I probably do.  I thought it was just a way to use folders on a linux box, thinking I could have full access if I configured it that way
[12:02] <adaptr> Clarrisa: unless you share your root directory, in which case good luck with the re-install :)
[12:02] <soundray> !samba | Clarrisa
[12:02] <ubotu> Clarrisa: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[12:02] <_Dante_> semboy, in synaptic, in repositories, what do you have checked?
[12:02] <adaptr> Clarrisa: you do not *want* full access from Windows Exploder - ever
[12:03] <_Dante_> semboy, you should have the first four boxes checked.  do you?\
[12:03] <Clarrisa> adaptr.  ok, so how does a guy copy like 40 individual websites from a windows box, to a linux box, each of the websites are separate and need to go inside each individual /var/www/<websitename> folder
[12:03] <soundray> _Dante_: he's looking for the wrong package
[12:04] <snype> !xinerama
[12:04] <ubotu> xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[12:04] <semboy> _Dante_ okei i got all check
[12:04] <semboy> _dante_ checked*
[12:04] <Clarrisa> adaptr, keeping in mind this is only a LAMP box with no GUI
[12:04] <Skaag> Hey guys, I have a strange problem with a kernel module that is being erased every time I reboot my box
[12:04] <_Dante_> semboy, do you have a AMD64 chip with 64 bit ubuntu?
[12:04] <adaptr> Clarrisa: by sharing the /var/www directory to a user with limited permissions - there is no need for root permissions when working with web sites
[12:04] <Skaag> I have to reinstall linux-restricted-modules every time I boot the box, or the nvidia.ko is gone.
[12:05] <erik1397> so, halo anyone?
[12:05] <semboy> _Dante_ i am not sure about the 64 bit ubuntu
[12:05] <Clarrisa> adaptr,  OH!!!  ok....
[12:05] <semboy> _dante_ yes i have the chip
[12:05] <Clarrisa> adaptr, that will work for me.
[12:05] <adaptr> Clarrisa: the full Samba documentation is online, including the definitive book by OReilly.. go read ;-)
[12:05] <soundray> semboy: can you give us the output from 'uname -a' on your machine
[12:05] <bimberi> Clarrisa: zip up all the folders into a single archive.  transfer to Linux box (using sftp if you have ssh going) and unzip
[12:05] <kidko> Anybody having problems getting their Deskjet 722C to work correctly? It was fine until I moved up from Dapper
[12:06] <Rasta> o_o do i have to completely remove gnome in order to use xfce?
[12:06] <paulstarr> ubotu, ati > me
[12:06] <Skaag> Rasta: never
[12:06] <kidko> Rasta, no
[12:06] <adaptr> Clarrisa: google for "using samba" and you will know everything we do
[12:06] <soundray> Rasta: no
[12:06] <adaptr> kidko: I'd surmise that you are having problems; I'm not
[12:06] <Clarrisa> bimeri, that would help some, except they are on various windowz boxes...
[12:06] <Rasta> ok ;)
[12:06] <_Dante_> semboy, in synaptic -- hit the search button and type in nvidia
[12:06] <Clarrisa> adaptr, ok...   will do.
[12:06] <soundray> Rasta: select the session you want at the login screen
[12:07] <_Dante_> semboy, you should get a bunch of hits.
[12:07] <soundray> semboy: the package you want is 'linux-restricted-modules-generic'
[12:07] <_Dante_> semboy, select "linux-restricted-modules...." for install
[12:07] <adaptr> Clarrisa: and there is no such thing as "only a LAMP box".. it is infinitely more powerful than any comparable shitty OS with shitty web server...
[12:07] <bimberi> Clarrisa: ah, kk.  a samba based method would be to share /var/www as a samba share and connect to samba as a user who is a member of the www-data group (and can hence write to that directory)
[12:08] <_Dante_> semboy, and you'll need the generic one too
[12:08] <soundray> !language | adaptr
[12:08] <ubotu> adaptr: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[12:08] <Clarrisa> adaptr...  ok I believe you.
[12:08] <thread> how do I select which java my system should use? there was a command-line tool...
[12:09] <Warbo> thread: "sudo update-alternatives --config java"
[12:09] <thread> thank you!
[12:09] <Skaag> Ok, what do I have to say or do in order for someone to help me out with my disappearing nvidia.ko problem? :-)
[12:09] <soundray> Skaag: if someone knew the answer, they would respond.
[12:09] <Skaag> soundray: maybe I'm in the wrong room?
[12:09] <pythonic> Skaag: the magic word :-)
[12:09] <Clarrisa> bimberi, currently my /var/www is root:apachegroup, and I have myself set up as a user of apachegroup, but I still can't see /var/www when I net use into my linux box
[12:09] <Skaag> pythonic: Please? :-)
[12:10] <Skaag> pythonic: How about begging, does that work? ;-)
[12:10] <soundray> Skaag: I don't think so, but it is a bit of a strange problem.
[12:10] <adaptr> Clarrisa: did you actually share /var/www ?
[12:10] <bimberi> Clarrisa: have you shared that directory (in /etc/samba/smb.conf) ?
[12:10] <Skaag> yes I agree, it is very strange
[12:10] <Clarrisa> .... adaptr... uh, no.  I didn't
[12:10] <Skaag> any of you guys use linux-restricted-modules?
[12:10] <Clarrisa> that would be it I guess ;-)
[12:10] <soundray> Skaag: I would repeat the question occasionally, to see if any of those who have joined anew can help.
[12:10] <Skaag> and can tell me where the nvidia.ko file was placed?
[12:10] <adaptr> Clarrisa: then it is higly unlikely that it would work
[12:10] <adaptr> Skaag: of course, how else would I get nvidia ?
[12:11] <soundray> Skaag: I'll have a go though... what's your 'uname -a' output?
[12:11] <Clarrisa> adatpr... right...  I can see that now
[12:11] <Warbo> Skaag: You can get most package managers to give you a list of included files and their locations...
[12:11] <Skaag> Linux eris 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Fri Oct 13 18:41:40 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[12:11] <adaptr> Clarrisa: have you ever seen the samba configuration file ?
[12:11] <Clarrisa> omg linux is mind boggling.... so much to learn
[12:11] <Rob-West> where do i go for Kubuntu stuff
[12:11] <Skaag> Warbo: I can use dpkg-deb to view the structure myself, that's not the problem... there is an install script...
[12:11] <minerale> Greetings I have a cd I'd like to burn, it comes as a zip file with two .img files (one for each track) and a .cue file, how can I specify a cue file to the cd burner?
[12:11] <adaptr> Rob-West: #kubuntu ?
[12:11] <Warbo> Skaag: Oh, I stand corrected :)
[12:11] <Warbo> (Well, sit)
[12:11] <Clarrisa> adaptr, yes,  I have looked it at several times... but learning so much so fast that I get everything mixed up still
[12:12] <bimberi> Clarrisa: note that you'll need to restart samba after any changes to its configuration (sudo invoke-rc.d samba restart)
[12:12] <soundray> Skaag: I suggest you install the generic kernel instead of the 386 one. That will make the restricted module problem go away.
[12:12] <Skaag> Warbo: I thought perhaps because the package's signature is missing, that the install script would place the kernel module elsewhere
[12:12] <adaptr> Clarrisa: better slow down then, and get it *right*
[12:12] <Skaag> soundray: Aha!
[12:12] <Skaag> soundray: that's good advice
[12:12] <Skaag> I'll do that now
[12:12] <Clarrisa> bimberi, yep  I'm a samba restart pro!....  but that's about it :/
[12:12] <soundray> Skaag: the packages you want are linux-image-generic and linux-restricted-modules-generic
[12:12] <Warbo> Skaag: I used tobe the nvidia master, since I had suffered every problem possible with driver installation, but haven't used Nvidia for a while now
[12:12] <adaptr> Clarrisa: open it up in an editor, and add a section for your share : [web]  or something like that
[12:13] <bimberi> Clarrisa: hehe :)
[12:13] <Clarrisa> adaptr... ok
[12:13] <adaptr> bimberi: why would you want to restart samba ?
[12:13] <bimberi> adaptr: after changing smb.conf
[12:13] <Skaag> Warbo: moved to ATI?
[12:13] <adaptr> Clarrisa: the only thing after that that is absolutely mandatory is to add the directory you want to share, like so: "path = /var/www"
[12:13] <Skaag> soundray: seems like linux-image-generic is already installed.
[12:13] <adaptr> bimberi: I don't see why
[12:14] <soundray> Skaag: in that case, make sure you boot it as well. Probably best to uninstall the 386 image
[12:14] <Skaag> alright
[12:14] <Warbo> Skaag: Well, I bought a more powerful card than my Nvidia, but then found out there was a Free driver for it. Sadly my new laptop has a completely unsupported ATI card (2D accel with Free driver, nothing with FGLRX)
=== keith__ is now known as k31th
[12:14] <Skaag> Warbo: what card is that, that has a free driver??
[12:14] <Skaag> I want!
[12:14] <bimberi> adaptr: hmm it is my habit to do so.  Mainly because it applies to so many other things when  you change their config
[12:15] <Warbo> Skaag: ATI Radeon 9200
[12:15] <Warbo> Skaag: Not what one might call the cutting edge :)
[12:15] <Clarrisa> adaptr,  Ok, nowwww I remember... I have a share created in there for one of the websites I initially created.... but I had forgot about it, and was never using the name of the share in my Net Use/Map network drive command... so I never saw it....
[12:15] <adaptr> Clarrisa: in your case, you will also want to set a group for all files written to the share: "force group = apachegroup"
[12:15] <Skaag> Warbo: it has a free driver with full 3D accel?
[12:15] <soundray> Skaag: pretty much all ati and nvidia cards are supported by free drivers (nv, ati or radeon). Some work well with them, some don't
[12:16] <adaptr> bimberi: samba is designed to re-read its configuration every minute or so
[12:16] <CorpseFeeder> I have a non-existent printer showing up which can't be deleted. How do I delete it???\
[12:16] <shynok> hello, what is a package comparable to gksudo that i can install on a fluxbox installation of ubuntu?
[12:16] <soundray> Skaag: no, they are usually 2D, but not 3D accelerated
[12:16] <Skaag> oh I see...
[12:16] <Warbo> Skaag: 3D yes, composite/alpha no (I found Compiz ran slow). Check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver (I started that page, but now it's been taken over by someone more competant)
[12:16] <bimberi> adaptr: cool :)
[12:16] <soundray> Gotta go. Skaag, good luck
[12:16] <adaptr> Clarrisa: but none of this will work unless you also have access to the shares from windows, and I'm guessing you now have guest access to all shares, which is a security nightmare
[12:17] <CorpseFeeder> gnome-cups-manager has a printer icon stuck in there which refuses to be deleted. How do I delete it?
[12:17] <adaptr> Clarrisa: if you care to step aside, we can go over the config file if you like
[12:17] <Clarrisa> adaptr.... sure
[12:17] <semboy> _Dante_ okei  all worked just fine , and i saw the nvidia screen when i started my x
[12:17] <semboy> _Dante_ but now my desktop is so big , is there a way to make it smaller
[12:18] <bud_> hello
[12:18] <bud_> i have hibernation problems with my hp nx6110 laptop
[12:18] <Skaag> rebooting, brb.
[12:19] <Clarrisa> adaptr, what do you mean by step aside?
[12:19] <Skaag> Warbo: that's interesting, since i'm considering moving to ATI at some point very soon
[12:19] <Skaag> ok brb
[12:19] <Skaag> going to try the generic kernel
[12:19] <adaptr> Clarrisa: I mean open a private chat
[12:19] <Clarrisa> adaptr, I can see the share now, but I can't actually write any files to it....
[12:20] <adaptr> Clarrisa: that is correct - unlike WindBlowz, Linux actually has a sense of security ;-)
[12:20] <bimberi> CorpseFeeder: try editing (carefully) /etc/cups/printers.conf
[12:20] <tonyyarusso> I could use help troubleshooting a vhosts setup in Apache.  I can't get it to have a different DocumentRoot for a particular subdomain.
[12:20] <Clarrisa> adaptr, so I've seen with every little thing I've tried to do.... can be annoying at first I think
[12:20] <CokeNCode> is there a linux version of tvuplayer ?
[12:21] <adaptr> Clarrisa: this "annoyance" is what makes Unix secure
[12:21] <Club_M_Admin> How do i go about changing the welcome text when i login into my box via ssh
[12:21] <Clarrisa> adaptr, but I can appreciate the reasoning as windows security is an oxymoron
[12:21] <adaptr> Club_M_Admin: edit /etc/issue.net
[12:22] <bimberi> Club_M_Admin: /etc/motd
[12:22] <adaptr> Clarrisa: actually, it is now moving more towards being an industry goldmine instead ;-)
[12:22] <adaptr> Club_M_Admin: oh yeah, and that, too
[12:22] <Club_M_Admin> ljl, yove baned a total of 68 people wow
[12:22] <bud_> problem is that battery status is frozzen
[12:22] <CorpseFeeder> say /etc/cups/printers.conf contains no information except for two comment lines.
[12:22] <bud_> after the hibernation
[12:22] <shynok> hello, what is a package comparable to gksudo that i can install on a fluxbox installation of ubuntu? I cannot install gksudo apt-get says it's not available
[12:23] <bud_> anyone had sam problem
[12:23] <bimberi> shynok: gksu
[12:23] <Clarrisa> adaptr, I'm not following you on the "goldmine" comment...  is that to mean the bGates machines is going to lose marketshare more quickly now?
[12:23] <CorpseFeeder> gnome-cups-manager has a printer icon stuck in there which refuses to be deleted. How do I delete it? It is a network printer and there is nothing in the printers.conf file
[12:23] <Richard__> does anyone know where wine outputs errors and stuff? when trying to run a program wine just exits and says nothing
[12:23] <eegore> How do add a running application to nohup
[12:23] <Richard__> ie, a log file somewhere
[12:24] <adaptr> Clarrisa: I haven't got the faintest clue what you mean.. what I mean is simply that selling security products for Windows is a multi-billion-dollar industry.. while the consumers aren't actually getting any security in return
[12:24] <bimberi> 0_o
[12:24] <britton> thank you for the help
[12:24] <adaptr> LjL should stop messing around with his identical twwn :)
[12:24] <adaptr> twwwinnn damn
[12:24] <semboy> _Dante_ but now my desktop is so big , is there a way to make it smaller
[12:25] <LjL> true that
[12:25] <Clarrisa> adaptr, oh ok.  no what I was asking was if you meant that that Microsoft was finally going to get it's but beat in terms of marketshare due to linux becoming more mainstream
[12:25] <Clarrisa> ^butt
[12:25] <adaptr> Clarrisa: no, if I'd meant that then I would've said that
[12:25] <MANDRAKELINU> sall all
[12:25] <MANDRAKELINU> :D
[12:25] <Clarrisa> adaptr...oh ;-)
=== MANDRAKELINU is now known as mandrakelinux

[12:27] <Thorbinator> hello

[12:27] <Thorbinator> i am having some trouble installing on my old laptop
[12:27] <bud_> hello! i have problems with my computer after restoring it from hibernation, my battery status is frozzen, could anyone help me?
[12:27] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: look in CUPS itself
[12:27] <Clarrisa> adaptr, I have felt the sting of the stupid spyware, virus crap in windows for far too long.  I used to love norton utilities back when it was just a file recovery tool.  now I can stand hearing the name symantec, antivirus, or mcafee, etc....  I wonder sometimes if their is a division in each company that actually exploits all of microsoft's holes so that windows users have to then pay mcafee/symantec/etc them to fix plug them
[12:28] <J-_> what's the best 'java' to install in ubuntu?
[12:28] <tonyyarusso> Clarrisa: #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[12:28] <adaptr> Clarrisa: sure, but I'm not really interested in Windows or flamewars
[12:28] <jw_606> Hello
[12:28] <adaptr> J-_: the one that works
[12:28] <Thorbinator> looks like my question is but one in a series of man
[12:28] <Clarrisa> tonyyarusso,  your right, sorry... back to the subject
[12:28] <Thorbinator> y
[12:28] <J-_> adaptr: excellent, which one would that be?
[12:29] <adaptr> J-_: why not install everything you can find ? usually works for me
[12:29] <J-_> nah
[12:29] <Clarrisa> adaptr.... I have to take a potty break.... will you still be here in 5 min?  I would like to go through the config if you have a couple mins?

[12:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about card reader - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:29] <adaptr> J-_: okay, to start again: the correct way would be to start by telling us what you have tried so far, and if that didn't work, what happened instead of what you were expecting
[12:30] <LjL> !fishing | meshyf
[12:30] <ubotu> meshyf: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[12:30] <Richard__> Thorbinator, if it's a really old laptop (192 mb of ram or less) I would recommend Xubuntu, unless of course you're already using that :)
[12:30] <Thorbinator> its not that super old
[12:30] <Thorbinator> :P

[12:32] <semboy> adaptr yes how}
[12:32] <semboy> ?
[12:32] <CorpseFeeder> I do not understand "interface with CUPS by means of its web server"
[12:32] <adaptr> Club_M_Admin: you have gotten multiple answers to that question already - what is the problem ?
[12:32] <rlared_> hey everyone, i just used gnome partition manager to resize my main partition, and it crashed, and now it reports that my main partition is way more full that it actually is
[12:32] <bimberi> adaptr: ...
[12:33] <J-_> well look at that; jre 1.4 worked in opera
[12:33] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: localhost:631

[12:33] <Clarrisa_2008> oh, well that sucked  lol
[12:33] <GNU\colossus> *g*
[12:33] <Thorbinator> might wanna change your pw now clarissa
[12:33] <jw_606> No help on my problem anyone?
[12:33] <Clarrisa_2008> LOL
[12:33] <Club_M_Admin> ADAPTR, the answers were for changing the version which i have changed to Club Mckinley Web Administration but that little copyright message that pops up after login via ssh is what i want to change
[12:33] <Clarrisa_2008> damn
[12:34] <rlared_> anyone know why it might be saying that my main partition is way more full?  temp files somewhere created during resizing or something?
[12:34] <J-_> lol
[12:34] <adaptr> yes indeed, and why even bother - you don;t need to register here
[12:34] <Clarrisa_2008> adaptr, I thought in order to private message I would have to register
[12:34] <tonyyarusso> adaptr: For some things you do; we recommend it.
[12:34] <Thorbinator> it seems like the laptop is somehow restricting access or something from the drive
[12:34] <adaptr> Club_M_Admin: no need to shout, what do you mean ? like you were told earlier, everything that is displayed on login is contained in either /etc/issue.net or /etc/motd
[12:34] <adaptr> Clarrisa_2008: no, you just need to click on my name
[12:35] <Clarrisa_2008> oh, ok
[12:35] <meeow> hello, i'm using the following guide to get wpa working with 6.10 http://www.debianadmin.com/enable-wpa-wireless-access-point-in-ubuntu-linux.html
[12:35] <adaptr> tonyyarusso: which things ?
[12:35] <Thorbinator> btw, adaptr you are a god for putting up with all this
[12:35] <adaptr> Thorbinator: heh, everybody was a newbie once
[12:35] <meeow> but when i sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome network-manager
[12:35] <Club_M_Admin> adaptr, sorry is caps considered shot? ok, i eddited issue.net but is motd a file?
[12:35] <meeow> it cant find the package
[12:36] <adaptr> Club_M_Admin: yes, they are both files - issue.net is what is displayed BEFORE you login, and motd is displayed AFTER a successful login
[12:36] <tonyyarusso> adaptr: #1) private messages, #2) entering the channel during botnet attacks., #3) cloaks (I believe)
[12:36] <palomer> anyone know how to use \includegraphics to import a png to a latex file so that it preserves its original dimensions?
[12:36] <Club_M_Admin> adapt, my bad i found what i was looking for thanks
[12:36] <adaptr> tonyyarusso: hmm okay, thanks, didn't know that - must read those channel messages some time ;-)
[12:36] <meeow> and when i gedit /ect/network/interfaces
[12:36] <meeow> it's blank
[12:36] <Clarrisa_2008> adaptr, so I do have to register right?
[12:36] <Clarrisa_2008> adaptr, which is not a problem for me...
[12:36] <Thorbinator> you dont have to register
[12:37] <meeow> does anyone have a link to a better tutorial/guide on how to get wpa working with 6.10
[12:37] <adaptr> Clarrisa_2008: apparently, sorry about that
[12:37] <rlared> hey i used gnome partition manager to resize my main partition and it crashed, and now it says that my main partition is twice as full as it was
[12:37] <Clarrisa_2008> I clicked on adaptr's name... I have a separate window there, but no response... I'm using xchat
[12:37] <rlared> anyone know how i might fix that/
[12:37] <CorpseFeeder> the CUPS interface gives no (working) option to delete the non-existent printer. It just responds with "cannot connect to server" since the printer doesn't physically exist.
[12:37] <pschulz01_> Greetings, Which SMTP server is recommended?
[12:37] <adaptr> Clarrisa_2008: I've just registered too, so it should work now
[12:37] <Clarrisa_2008> adaptr... not a problem...hang on
[12:38] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: that is not what the message means
[12:38] <pschulz01_> I need to forward email to a smarthost.
[12:38] <Club_M_Admin> motd is permissioned what now??
[12:38] <JustNew> Hi people. I just downloaded an mpg file. the system says that i don't have a decoder. Now im not sure exactly what format the movie is in. Is there a good way to download a bunch of decoders or find out which one my file is?
[12:38] <adaptr> pschulz01_: then install ssmtp
[12:38] <adaptr> pschulz01_: it does that and not much else

[12:38] <pschulz01_> adaptr: I have used exim in the past under Debian, and that was really easy..
[12:38] <adaptr> pschulz01_: so why do you ask ?
[12:39] <JustNew> thankyou
[12:39] <pschulz01_> adaptr: Because there might be a 'Ubunt Way'[TM] 
[12:39] <pschulz01_> 'Ubunt Way'[TM] 
[12:39] <pschulz01_> 'Ubuntu Way'[TM] 
[12:39] <adaptr> pschulz01_: then I fear you have misunderstood the Ubuntu way
[12:39] <Clarrisa_2008> brb
[12:40] <adaptr> pschulz01_: the Ubuntu way cannot logically restrict you more than the general Linux way of "choice" does
[12:40] <adaptr> or it would suck, and it doesna... it really really doesna :)
[12:40] <CorpseFeeder> ??? the browser says "Unable to connect Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 192.168.1.66:631." - there is no computer at 192.168.1.66 on my network and no such printer anyway. If that doesn't mean the printer I am trying to delete doesn't exist, I don't know what else it can mean.\
[12:41] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: what that message means is that "localhost" does not point to the IP address of your own computer - which is a bigger problem than just printing
[12:41] <ValMarko> what is beryl?
[12:41] <adaptr> ValMarko: beryl is pure beauty

[12:41] <pschulz01_> adaptr: .. but .. if I find a problem, I would like to be using something that somebody else knows about, and then it can get fixed.
[12:42] <adaptr> pschulz01_: and you know of many MTAs that are not used by other people ?
[12:42] <Dial_tone> I don't see a 2.6.17-686 kernel image in Edgy, is there one?
[12:42] <ValMarko> How can I see my environmente is able to get beryl?
[12:42] <CorpseFeeder> no, local host is pointing to this computer's IP but on http://localhost:631/printers/ there is a printer listed as being connected at 192.168.66 but I have no such printer or server
[12:42] <bimberi> Club_M_Admin: sudo gedit /etc/motd

[12:43] <DamianFinol> Good evening, I'm trying to install a spanish dictionary to mozilla thunderbird but it's not working
[12:43] <Franz|> and beryl is very very great !
=== Franz| is now known as Franz
[12:44] <pschulz01_> adaptr: Hmm.. I'll go have a look at ssmtp
[12:44] <DamianFinol> it just doesn't show up in the dictionary list
[12:44] <CorpseFeeder> there is nothing wrong with my localhost.. it is pointing to 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.70 - it is this damned printer listed in cups which doesn't exist and can't be removed
[12:44] <ValMarko> the message is: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[12:44] <ValMarko> direct rendering: Yes
[12:44] <ValMarko> Am I able to get Beryl?
[12:44] <jms1989> Will an ASUS motherboard with AMD graphics support NiVada drivers?
[12:45] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: what do you mean cannot be removed ?
[12:45] <cmwe1> i better scat before he finds me
[12:45] <GNU\colossus> jms1989: of course
[12:45] <CorpseFeeder> meaning I can't delete the printer icon for the printer
[12:45] <Franz> It's ok ValMarko !
[12:45] <Franz> Beryl can work on your system !
[12:45] <jms1989> So, I can remove the AMD drivers and install NiVada?
[12:45] <ValMarko> But... what about the warning?
[12:45] <CorpseFeeder> in the gnome-cups-manager app, there is a printer icon for this printer and I can't remove the icon for it, yes
[12:46] <Franz> it's not a problem, i have the same, but no problem
[12:46] <Club_M_Admin> cmwe1? figures...
[12:46] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: I would not consider an icon to be very important
[12:46] <LjL> Club_M_Admin: what the heck is going on?
[12:46] <CorpseFeeder> it isn't important, but why is it stuck there?
[12:46] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: because it is still in the gnome registry ?
[12:47] <ValMarko> I'm using Kubuntu. Is that ok to install Beryl? where can I get it?
[12:47] <CorpseFeeder> surely there must be some way to get rid of it?
[12:47] <Franz> Yes, it's ok
[12:47] <Club_M_Admin> ljl, sorry, he told me about this and since our antire office space is all ubuntu i didnt expect him to be on
[12:47] <Club_M_Admin> ljl, dont worry he knows whats comming
[12:48] <Franz> You must first modify the sources.list file ValMarko
[12:48] <adaptr> CorpseFeeder: sure, open up the gnome registry and remove it
[12:48] <LjL> Club_M_Admin: uh... i don't know who's who anymore.
[12:48] <ValMarko> What does it mean?
[12:48] <Club_M_Admin> ljl, :-P
[12:48] <CorpseFeeder> where do I find gnome registry?
[12:48] <nolimitsoya> CorpseFeeder, there is no such thing in unix
[12:48] <jms1989> ?
[12:49] <JustNew> Hi. Thanks for your advice, it worked for some of my movie files but not all. is there a way of seeing what format is expected?
[12:49] <Franz> You can find a tuto at ubuntu.beryl-project.org/join #ubuntu-fr
[12:49] <Ubuntos> hi folks

[12:49] <Zober> thx
[12:49] <thejapa> CorpseFeeder: gconf-editor, he was not lying

[12:50] <Club_M_Admin> wt
[12:50] <CMWb> my bad
[12:50] <kaoz> jcore u have to open the gedit file using the sudo command first
[12:50] <adaptr> jcore: you should have opened it as root, you cannot now save it as non-root
[12:50] <exlt> I've been searching for why a blacklisted module is still loaded, even though it is listed in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist - I can unload it manually fine - this worked in 6.10, however is not working in feisty
[12:50] <jcore> ohhh

[12:51] <jevangelo> how do you mount dvd isos
[12:51] <starz> jevangelo, .iso ?
[12:51] <adaptr> drm_: there's a friggin' button labeled "advanced.." in add/remove, CLICK IT :)
[12:51] <drm_> adaptr: ?
[12:51] <jevangelo> yea
[12:52] <exlt> jevangelo: sudo mount -o loop /path/to/iso /mnt/point/
[12:52] <ValMarko> thank you :)
[12:52] <drm_> adapr: where i can't see it?
[12:52] <adaptr> drm_: then I can't help you, sorry
[12:52] <Club_M_Admin> Where do i get java for this so i can run Limewire?
[12:52] <drm_> adaptr: there isn't one
[12:52] <starz> jevangelo, man mount
[12:53] <starz> there is a specific command for isos which i dont remember offhand but the format is something like:
[12:53] <bimberi> drm_: i think 'advanced mode' is to use synaptic instead
[12:53] <adaptr> drm_: it's next to the Help button
[12:53] <starz> mount -t iso=9660 /path/to/iso.iso /folder/to/mount/on
[12:53] <starz> or so
[12:53] <drm_> adaptr: no you're wrong
[12:53] <drm_> bimb: i'll check it out thanks
[12:53] <CorpseFeeder> hmm.. ok, I can't find anything relating to printers or cups in gconf-editor
[12:53] <starz> ah what exlt said lol
[12:54] <starz> sorry didnt see it >_<
[12:54] <adaptr> drm_: what do you mean, I'm *wrong* -  How can I be wrong when I'm staring at it ?
[12:54] <starz> unable to open files list file for package `libgpg-error0'  <<--- anyone know how to fix that ?
[12:54] <drm_> adaptr: well something is wrong with mine, because it IS NOT THERE
[12:54] <adaptr> drm_: what version of Ubuntu are you using ?
[12:54] <bimberi> drm_ and adaptr probably have a different ubuntu versions
[12:54] <gnov> is the mail command part of sendmail?
[12:55] <bimberi> gnov: no, install "mailx"
[12:55] <adaptr> bimberi: do you mean to say they changed that around ? hmmm sub-optimal, at least
[12:55] <gnov> thanks
[12:55] <bimberi> adaptr: no, i'm guessing :)
[12:55] <exlt> starz: that sounds like a corrupt package - try a fresh download
[12:55] <drm_> adaptr: 6.10
[12:55] <starz> exlt, did
[12:55] <exlt> hrm..
[12:55] <starz> a while earlier i pasted an paste
[12:56] <starz> lemme see if i can find it in my firefox history
[12:56] <adaptr> drm_: sorry, in that case bimberi was completely right
[12:56] <adaptr> even by accident
[12:56] <drm_> adapt: thank you, and it's ok :)
[12:56] <bimberi> lol
[12:56] <adaptr> I'm on 6.06LTS
[12:56] <CorpseFeeder> if indeed I can remove a printer using gconf-editor, where do I find the relevant section to modify?
[12:56] <adaptr> which I'd advise everyone to do, by the way...

[12:58] <Edulix> eclipse is running via gcj (ps aux | grep eclipse tells me that)
[12:58] <exlt> starz: looking - wife just came home and need to go eat dinner, though
[12:58] <Edulix> but I want it to be executed via sun jre
[12:58] <Edulix> how to reconfigure that?
[12:58] <burner> levanderjust take out all the text :)
[12:59] <Edulix> I tried dpkg-reconfigure java but that doesn't work, apparently
[12:59] <levander> But, is it possible just to delete it?
[12:59] <Yggdrasil> can somone help me out, i geeping getting a hald error.. its not starting or something. when i boot up it just sits on starting hald for bout 5 minutes and then gnome wont work.
[12:59] <Edulix> update-alternatives --config java
[12:59] <cmwe1> What repository is Java 5 on?
[12:59] <LjL> !java | cmwe1
[12:59] <ubotu> cmwe1: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[01:00] <cmwe1> !multiverse
[01:00] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[01:00] <Edulix> LjL: I have sun jre installed and update-alternatives tells me that it's the default
[01:00] <LjL> in pm, cmwe1, in pm
[01:00] <Edulix> so why oh why eclipse is running with gcj?
[01:01] <LjL> Edulix: perhaps it's a setting withing eclipse itself?
[01:01] <neruatix> codeblocks is telling me it can't open libcodeblocks.so.0
[01:01] <Edulix> LjL: no idea
[01:01] <Edulix> I suspect that I installed too many eclipse packages
[01:01] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix: you have to set $JAVA_PATH
[01:02] <L0cKd0wN> where are the ubuntu i386 torrents located?
[01:02] <GNU\colossus> try cdimage.ubuntu.com
[01:02] <GNU\colossus> via http
[01:02] <kitche> debian_gnu_mc: do you mean JAVA_HOME?
[01:02] <kitche> L0cKd0wN: they are in the same spot as the isos are
[01:02] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: maybe if I aptitude remove eclipse-gcj it will work better
[01:02] <debian_gnu_mc> kitche: yeah that was what i meant
[01:02] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix: nope
[01:02] <Edulix> (that's what Imeant with "too many eclipse packages")
[01:02] <Olivia> Hey guys, I have a question
[01:02] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: uhm
[01:03] <adaptr> Olivia: don't keep us all in suspense!
[01:03] <Olivia> I installed Ubuntu on another computer, and moved the hard drive over to a different machine. Now it can't mount the root file system.
[01:03] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: ok, how and to what should I set JAVA_PATH ?
[01:03] <kitche> Edulix: did you install eclipse-gcj?
[01:03] <Edulix> to /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/bin/java I suspect
[01:04] <Edulix> kitche: yes, and It's being removed
[01:04] <Edulix> kitche: don't remember when, though
[01:04] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix:  to   /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/ i think
[01:04] <kitche> Edulix: ah yeah think that package is built for gcj
[01:04] <adaptr> Olivia: check hard drive connections, jumper settings, and BIOS settings
[01:04] <Edulix> kitche: that's probably true lol
[01:05] <Olivia> adaptr. I checked everything. It finds Ubuntu system, then timesout trying to get to the root file system and loads "BusyBox"
[01:05] <adaptr> Olivia: what kind of hard disk is this on?
[01:05] <Olivia> Maxtor 60GB
[01:05] <Olivia> Hard drive
[01:06] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: where should I set that var?
[01:06] <Edulix> which file, etc
[01:06] <adaptr> Olivia: by "what kind" I mean how is it connected to the PC ?
[01:06] <Edulix> system wide if it's possible ;)
[01:06] <Olivia> adaptr IDE
[01:06] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix:  in ~/.bashrc
[01:06] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: I remove eclipse-gcj but as you said, it's still running over gcj
[01:06] <adaptr> Olivia: and you have connected it in exactly the same way as in the other PC ?
[01:06] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix:  add: export $JAVA_HOME "thePathIToldYou"
[01:07] <kitche> Edulix: you have to sudo update-alternative command to ue native java just to be on the safe side if you didn't do that already
[01:07] <Olivia> adaptr: Yes, and it was working on that one. It points to the location /dev/hdc1 I think.
[01:07] <Olivia> adaptr: Is there a way using busybox that I can check what folder the hdd is mounted to?
[01:07] <Linuturk> I just installed the nvidia driver, and I want to test the 3D acceleration. What is a good method for testing 3D ?
[01:08] <debian_gnu_mc> Linuturk: glxgears
[01:08] <Linuturk> the screensaver?
[01:08] <debian_gnu_mc> Linuturk: what does glxinfo | grep rendering    say?
[01:08] <Linuturk> debian_gnu_mc: ?
[01:08] <adaptr> Olivia: then your boot files are on this drive, but the system is not.. your system cannot boot from hdc
[01:08] <debian_gnu_mc> Linuturk: glxgears is no screensaver,simply run it
[01:08] <kitche> Linuturk: not glxgears since that's not a benchmark really use a game like tuxracer or something like that
[01:08] <Linuturk> debian_gnu_mc: :) it says yes
[01:09] <adaptr> Olivia: folders are not relevant at this point.. you have now already mentioned two different physical hard drives, none of which can boot a PC system
[01:09] <debian_gnu_mc> Linuturk: than everythin is fine ;)
[01:09] <Linuturk> thanks!@!
[01:09] <L0cKd0wN> damn, gotta love I2 mirrors
[01:09] <Olivia> adaptr: Well, I only had one hard drive on the other computer. And they were all on that disk.
[01:10] <Edulix> kitche: I did that, didn't work
[01:10] <kitche> Olivia: what is the error that your system is saying?
[01:10] <adaptr> Olivia: then grub has probably screwed something up.. you need to look at your grub config
[01:10] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: I did what you told me, but that only works if I execute eclipse from the cmd
[01:10] <kitche> Olivia: nevermind did you check fstab when you moved that hard drive over?
[01:11] <Edulix> if I do for example alt+f2 "eclipse"..
[01:11] <Edulix> plus, it's still saying something about gcj:
[01:11] <Olivia> adaptr: How do I look at the grub file?
[01:11] <Olivia> kitche: the errof is ALERT! /dev/hdc1 does not exsist. Dropping to a shell!
[01:11] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix: hm well you could create e desktop icon which runs a script that starts eclipse from the console

[01:14] <Edulix> (that's not the command, but the output of ps aux | grep eclipse )
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[01:14] <Olivia> kitche: okay. Problem with that is I don't have a CD burner here.
[01:15] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix: so whats your problem?
[01:15] <kitche> Olivia: you don't have a live cd laying around not even the ubuntu desktop install cd?
[01:15] <we2by> firefox is a bit sucky today. it's not very responsive :(
[01:16] <we2by> it's kind of slow
[01:16] <jw_606> how would I install a file with the .sh extention?
[01:16] <kitche> we2by: did you turn off ipv6 already?
[01:16] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc:  it's still saying some crap about gcj. next step, remove all packages gcj-related
[01:16] <Olivia> kitche: I installed linux a long time ago. Moved out of my house, I come back and the windows install on my parents computer is bad. I brought the Hard Drive with ubuntu on it from my apartment back here. So yes I have a lot of Linux distros, and live cd's laying around. Just not here.
=== cschees is now known as x-man89
[01:16] <kitche> jw_606: sh <name>.sh but .sh is usually a shell script

[01:17] <Edulix> yes
[01:17] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: yes

[01:18] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: yes
[01:19] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix: so why does that gcj thing bother you?
[01:20] <Drudley> Is there any general fix for making ubuntu work on generally new HP computers? Or am I just special?
[01:20] <we2by> ok, ffox is screwed up
[01:20] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: now it doesn't :P but previously it did because eclipse was using gcj and was slower than with sun jre
[01:20] <kitche> Drudley: should work or what's yur problem exactly
[01:20] <we2by> I can't even open https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[01:21] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix: normally eclipse should runt much faster with gcj
[01:21] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: well it's not my case
[01:21] <debian_gnu_mc> Edulix: btw: IBM's JDK might be even faster
[01:21] <Edulix> debian_gnu_mc: for example the startup time has now decreased
[01:22] <Drudley> kitche: The problem is that I've tried with the x86 live cd the x86 alternate/alternative and a emd 64 alt cd, and when i reboot with them i never get further than the menu, whatever installation option i click on at that menu, it tries to installs but stops and ends with a black screen and blinking underline

I've set up and configured a Fedora box, just using the web components that came with my distro. Being new to Linux, it seems that everything I'm reading indicates that I will probably have an easier out-of-the-box experience maintaining Ubunto. Any thoughts about this?

[01:33] <DekKeD> anyone knows how to mount a video as if it was your webcam? It can be funny :P

[01:33] <Synesthesia> Wow, the mom test is hardcore -- how is she doing with it?
[01:33] <Synesthesia> Well, the server edition doesn't have a GUI...

[01:33] <hexidigital_> hi folks... i'm having a problem getting cpu frequency scaling to work on my laptop.. i didn't think my CPU was supported until i did a test install of Mepis, where it worked by the default install.
[01:34] <rambo3> is Mepis ubuntu bound now?
[01:34] <Olivia> Okay, new development. It says: "Begin: Waiting for root file system... ..."
[01:34] <Richard__> isnt there an ISP package with loads of gui goodness for dns stuff and the likes?
[01:35] <Synesthesia> Are there any security implications with running the GUI on my server?
[01:35] <Donogh> Synesthesia: i imagine you could lock it down pretty easily
[01:35] <Richard__> Synesthesia, your mother might be able to shut down the pc ;)
[01:35] <job> Donogh try this site http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/?Installation

[01:35] <Richard__> MSTK: I demand that you make me some waffles first
[01:35] <MSTK> it might have something to do with a setting I accidentally changed in Beryl
[01:36] <job> i have a linksys car and i got my help from there
[01:36] <hexidigital_> MSTK::  what did you change?
[01:36] <MSTK> waffles are good, but my xbox is already in use

[01:36] <Donogh> thanks job!
[01:36] <MSTK> um, that's just it.  i don't know
[01:36] <Synesthesia> So is the automatic LAMP install included on the Desktop version as well? Or should I install the server version, then add gnome?
[01:36] <MSTK> I can't resize my windows for some reason
[01:36] <MSTK> it might have something to do with messing around with Beryl
[01:36] <snype> !lamp
[01:36] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[01:36] <Olivia> Okay it says: "ALERT! /dev/hdc1 does not exsist. Dropping to a shell!" then it goes to Busy Box.
[01:36] <MSTK> does any beryl setting inadvertently disallow window resizing?
[01:37] <bimberi> Synesthesia: Server CD only.  once installed you can install the ubuntu-desktop package to add the Desktop env.
[01:37] <snype> just the "window resize" setting
[01:37] <rambo3> Synesthesia, there is server install with LAMP option
[01:37] <snype> MSTK how much do u love beryl
[01:37] <MSTK> i love it quite alot.
[01:37] <snype> u using aiglx or xgl w/ it
[01:37] <MSTK> especially the completely pointless but awesome eye candy
[01:37] <MSTK> aiglx, I think
[01:38] <MSTK> I followed installation instructions for aiglx and they worked.
[01:38] <snype> MSTK --- pointless? i would say that wobbly windows are not pointless
[01:38] <rambo3> i told you not to post beryl-ubuntu videos on youtube
[01:38] <snype> i mean they are totally productive
[01:38] <snype> ....not
[01:38] <snype> but i actually love scale
[01:38] <snype> and the 3d cube
[01:39] <MSTK> i can't resize my windows now.  That may or may not be a result of me messing around with the beryl settings

[01:40] <Synesthesia_> (I got bumped, sorry if this has been answered...) Is the LAMP option available on the desktop installation?

[01:46] <bimberi> semboy: is the window maximised?  if so, you need to unmaximise before resizing

[02:00] <kalabalik> Just info
[02:00] <VMT2007> is it an open-source project?
[02:00] <tmccrary> select OSS on the first ones and see what hapens
[02:00] <kalabalik> could be yes!
[02:01] <kalabalik> If we all help out
=== rayer is now known as Rayer
[02:01] <pantalaimon_> how do we read a line from a file with just one line using shell script?
[02:01] <wasabi> cat | tail | head
[02:02] <apostle> yeah... OSS didn't change anything
[02:02] <somerville32> pantalaimon_: You could use sed?
[02:02] <somerville32> Or wait
[02:02] <pike_> pantalaimon_: google the solution using sed is prob best i think
[02:02] <pantalaimon_> somerville32, i dont know what this is, i started to read about shell script today
[02:02] <pantalaimon_> ok
[02:03] <SilentDis> hello :)
[02:03] <somerville32> pantalaimon_, : You might look to google, #bash, man pages, examples, etc.
[02:03] <majickmann> pantalaimon_ what do you wish to do with the script?
[02:04] <pantalaimon_> majickmann, read the name of a link that is inside a file and than pass this link to another program
[02:04] <tmccrary> apostle: Sorry man, I'm not sure whats going on exactly. Like I said, sounds like a hardware issue and/or a driver issue with that particular card. If you have another sound card, I'm sure it would work properly.
[02:04] <theBishop> is there a net-install for ubuntu?
[02:04] <tonyyarusso> !netinstall | theBishop
[02:04] <ubotu> theBishop: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[02:04] <purem> does anyone know how to make shift+backspace stop logging me out
[02:04] <purem> it logs me out a dozen times a day
[02:04] <purem> :(
[02:05] <apostle> it works perfectly fine over on windows though
[02:05] <majickmann> If the the link is constant or at least a "string" is constant...  use grep <string> filename
[02:06] <pike_> pantalaimon_: might be something like VARIABLE=$(grep linkname file) or whatever command you want in ()
[02:06] <majickmann> Depending on the program, you can set up a variable inside the program, assuming you have write access to it.
[02:07] <majickmann> or you may be able to use pipe to send it to the program...
[02:07] <apostle> and how would a bad sound card make click noise whenever the mouse moves?
[02:07] <Pelo> I need to unmount a ntfs drive using diskmounter and remount it using ntfs-3g  can anyone hold my hand and walk me through it ?
[02:07] <SilentDis> !dash
[02:07] <ubotu> /bin/sh links to the DASH shell in Ubuntu Edgy (6.10). Since DASH is not 100% compatible with the BASH shell, some scripts might break. You can make scripts execute using BASH by changing the first line of the script to "#!/bin/bash"
[02:07] <tmccrary> apostle: it is probably on the same interrupt as your video hardware
[02:07] <pantalaimon_> pike_, does this work: VAR=$(cat filename)
[02:07] <apostle> can i change that?
[02:08] <Zober> what is DRI in xorg.conf?
[02:08] <SilentDis> ahh good, was hoping ubotu had that one.
[02:08] <ripperda> I'm trying to install (6.10) by cd, things boot to the initial boot page, but any option leads to a "can't read the cd" error. is this something that's been seen before?
[02:08] <tmccrary> apostle: Not usually, if you could switch the slot it was on could help
[02:08] <apostle> both on board
[02:08] <tmccrary> apostle: You can get a good sound card for like $10-$20
[02:08] <pike_> pantalaimon_: yeah you can test that in terminal by typing it then echo $VAR
[02:08] <tmccrary> well, not a great one, but one that works properly
[02:09] <apostle> might have to do that
[02:09] <Zober> any1? DRI in xorg.confg?  Mine is set to 0666 on intel x3000
[02:09] <tmccrary> apostle: It looks like VIA has some binary drivers for cards with those chipsets, but like all binary drivers, you probably don't want that kind of trouble.
[02:09] <tmccrary> Sorry I couldn't be of more help in this situation
[02:09] <ubun> my entire ubuntu system crashed for the first time :( i came back home, and the mouse cursor was still moveable but wouldnt open anythin, no keys worked either alt+tab, or ctrl+alt+F1, i had to hit the reset button on my computer :(
[02:09] <ismail> hi guys
[02:09] <somerville32> ubun: If that happens, press crtl+alt+backspace to restart X instead of restarting your entire computer.
[02:09] <tonyyarusso> apostle: I can give you like three cheap soundcards for the cost of shipping.  (Found them around the house)
[02:10] <apostle> also, i installed KDE last night, and i've been getting this message off and on ever since: "Error - artsmessage  Sound server fatal error: cpu overload, aborting"
[02:10] <ubun> somerville32 i dont know if that woulda responded either, but ill try it next time
[02:10] <ismail> im gonna get a vedeo card this week what modle nvidia would work well with ubuntu
[02:10] <tmccrary> apostile: arts is the KDE sound server, could be related to the hardware issue
[02:10] <ubun> im surprised ubuntu didnt say anything about shutting linux down improperly
[02:13] <MSTK> does anyone know what the Desktop Plane plug-in for Beryl does?
[02:13] <pike_> i need more tremulous servers near me so guys... install tremulous
[02:13] <wceoscar> can anyone here paste the repo for the lastest drivers on nvidia cards?/
[02:13] <jroes> hey, I hooked my ubuntu box up to a TV using a TV-out cable, and once it loads ubuntu it can't switch into the proper video mode (probably because it's higher) ... is there any way to force it to start in 640x480 or something?
[02:13] <DekKeD> anyone knows how to mount a video as if it was your webcam? It can be funny :P
[02:14] <VMT2007> DekKeD:
[02:14] <VMT2007> google that :P
[02:14] <SilentDis> !envy | wceoscar
[02:14] <ubotu> wceoscar: envy is a Perl script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[02:14] <VMT2007> wow, there's an easier way?
[02:14] <SilentDis> !nvidia | wceoscar
[02:14] <ubotu> wceoscar: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:14] <VMT2007> oh well
[02:14] <SilentDis> !jfgi | VMT2007
[02:14] <ubotu> VMT2007: Words like noob, jfgi, stfu or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
[02:15] <wceoscar> i know, the prob is that im running beryl and i need the more stable and last drivers
[02:15] <Donogh> previously, on lost: nsdiswrapper-1.31 is untarred to ~/Desktop/ndiswrapper-1.31/ ... tried lots of variations of: sudo install nsdis<tab> /bin/ndis -- no deal!! : -p
[02:15] <DekKeD> VMT2007: I have googled already and found anything that works
[02:15] <VMT2007> uh
[02:15] <VMT2007> when did I say any of those words?
[02:15] <nn> SilentDis: what's jfgi mean?
[02:15] <SilentDis> nn:  just f****** google it.
[02:15] <nn> SilentDis: Ah, thanks
[02:15] <Xaphoo> For some reason nothing happens when I put in a CDROM... everything else is completely fine... DVDs play well... but no cdrom automounts and I can't figure out how to get it to manually mount
[02:15] <VMT2007> I did not say "just f***ing google it"
[02:15] <nn> SilentDis: never encountered that one before
[02:16] <SilentDis> nn:  nor had i till i started hanging out here lol
[02:16] <Patr|ck> hi, i'm having problems with my built ini wi-fi, intel pro/wireless. I can't install it, can someone please help ?
[02:16] <VMT2007> when did I say any of those terms
[02:16] <tmccrary> !jfgi | Test
[02:16] <ubotu> Test: Words like noob, jfgi, stfu or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
[02:16] <VMT2007> !botabuse
[02:16] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[02:16] <jroes> what config file do I need to play with to change my default video mode to 640x480 or whatever is TV-out compatible?
[02:17] <tmccrary> VMT2007: douche
[02:17] <jroes> (assuming a standard tv with rca cables, not an HDTV :P)

[02:17] <ubotu> tmccrary: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[02:17] <jroes> thanks VMT2007
[02:17] <DBO> tmccrary, watch your language
[02:17] <nn> SilentDis: are you, by chance knowledgable in the ways of any of the following: 1: high-speed mp3 encoding with LAME (such that i can rip a hundred CDs in 14 hours) 2: ubuntu installed on some sorta RAID across a bunch of USB thumdrives or 3: the videolan foo such that i can watch movies on my computer while using my wife's idle CPU time?
[02:17] <Patr|ck> i tried using a how to from ubuntu forum but all it did was mess everything up
[02:17] <SilentDis> VMT2007:  sorry, i thought the ubotu line was a bit... nicer.  still, we're here to help, and it's best not to refer anyone to just google it :)
[02:17] <VMT2007> SilentDis: i don't believe his question was on-topic
[02:17] <VMT2007> "ekKeD> anyone knows how to mount a video as if it was your webcam? It can be funny :P"
[02:18] <Patr|ck> anyone?
[02:18] <tmccrary> VMT2007: Are you some kind of expert? I've already seen you leave like 2-3 people hanging with their issue and no help
[02:18] <jevangelo> does anyone know about pcsx emulator?
[02:18] <DekKeD> why not? I want to know how to do that in Ubuntu Linux :P
[02:18] <jevangelo> it doesnt work
[02:18] <majickmann> pantalaimon...  if the link in the only entry in "filename", then use VAR=${`cat filename`}
[02:18] <jroes> do you guys know if 640x480 is the best you can get on a regular TV?
[02:18] <lawl> DCC SEND OMGWTFBBQ123456789
[02:18] <tonyyarusso> jroes: No idea - are there wiki pages about TV out?
[02:18] <gouki> jroes: It all depends on your TV. Read the manual to know which resolution it supports
[02:18] <VMT2007> oh awesome
[02:18] <Donogh> jroes: i don't think it translates to PC resolutions very directly
[02:18] <tonyyarusso> sigh
[02:19] <Donogh> it's usually scanning lines on TVs i think
[02:19] <jroes> well the average default console works perfectly
[02:19] <VMT2007> fix your routers kids
[02:19] <nn> VMT2007: stinksys?
[02:19] <VMT2007> nn: linksys isn't bad
[02:19] <Xaphoo> can anyone help me with a CD-ROM problem?  I cannot get data CDs to be read... DVDs read just fine, but not CDs...
[02:19] <Xaphoo> I'd like some help
[02:20] <nn> VMT2007: can you explain this router "sploit"?
[02:20] <tmccrary> Linksys Wr54Gs are very, very nice SOHO routers
[02:20] <VMT2007> nn: some routers don't like faulty DCC requests
[02:20] <gouki> tmccrary: You mean WRT54GS, right?
[02:20] <nn> tmccrary: yea they're great for building a cheap NAS too
[02:20] <nalioth> !offtopic
[02:20] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[02:21] <majickmann> pantalaimon... perhaps explaining your objective and resources will yield better responses?
[02:21] <DBO> sorry about the spam folks
[02:21] <VMT2007> the routers intercept DCC requests on port 6667 in order to allow for transfers
[02:21] <tmccrary> What spam?
[02:21] <jroes>  do you guys know where the nvtv package went?  http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Nvidia_easy_tv_out
[02:21] <VMT2007> the routers don't have any way of discriminating between bad requests and good ones
[02:21] <Xaphoo> is anyone familiar with my problem?  I cannot read DATA CDs, nothing mounts, if I do "sudo mount /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0" it responds with a message "no media"
[02:21] <jroes> oh, crap, probably in another repo my fault
[02:21] <VMT2007> there is a firmware fix
[02:21] <VMT2007> for most routers.
[02:22] <Xaphoo> yet the media is fine, it works on other computers
[02:22] <javaJake> Hey, guys, does the fact that my battery says 0% but it has been running fine for 15 minutes mean anything? Like, say, battery's gone koo-koo?
[02:22] <pike_> Xaphoo: these arent blank cds? theyre iso9660 format?
[02:22] <VMT2007> javaJake: check your apm settings
[02:22] <Donogh> google to the rescue: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:22] <tmccrary> javajake: ACPI is probably off in your kernel
[02:22] <javaJake> VMT2007: Mmm, how do I do that?
[02:22] <Xaphoo> pike: they are fine, they are burned on Windows though, and they still work fine on windows
[02:22] <javaJake> tmccrary: how do I turn it on? :P
[02:22] <VMT2007> follow tmccrary's suggestion too
[02:22] <nn> VMT2007: ah basically they're poorly written parsers, gotcha
[02:23] <javaJake> tmccrary: yea, let's try your idea first.
[02:23] <VMT2007> cat /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:23] <javaJake> tmccrary: is there something in the forums already.
[02:23] <javaJake> VMT2007: me?
[02:23] <tmccrary> javajake: In /boot/grub/menu.list, see if you have acpi=off or noacpi
[02:23] <VMT2007> yes
[02:23] <VMT2007> yeah
[02:23] <VMT2007> check that
[02:23] <javaJake> Checking
[02:23] <VMT2007> cat /boot/grub/menu.lst | grep acpi
[02:23] <Xaphoo> pike_: and ALL my data CDs have this problem now... DVDs are fine... haven't tried audo CDs yet
[02:23] <javaJake> If I suddenly stop talking, my battery died
[02:23] <javaJake> This thing suddenly worked today.
[02:23] <javaJake> Hasn't worked for months.
[02:23] <javaJake> :P
[02:23] <VMT2007> well
[02:23] <Jaak_> is there a sort of firewall that might prevent my front end not to connect to my rearend mythtv?
[02:24] <Managu> Xaphoo:  Is it possible this is a hardware problem?
[02:24] <VMT2007> perhaps the electronic equipment on the battery was fried?
[02:24] <jsmall> howdy
[02:24] <javaJake> VMT2007: maybe...
[02:24] <VMT2007> which means you can easily damage your notebook
[02:24] <VMT2007> consider getting another battery
[02:24] <Xaphoo> Managu: I can't see why... DVDs read and write fine, CDs write just fine, audio CDs play...
[02:24] <javaJake> VMT2007, tmccrary: no, no acpi stuff in menu.list, according to grepl.
[02:24] <javaJake> VMT2007: really?
[02:24] <pike_> Xaphoo: maybe the dev node changed? /dev/hdc or something.. the cd format wouldnt be the problem
[02:24] <javaJake> VMT2007: huh, well, know anywhere I can get 'em cheaper then $100? :D
[02:24] <VMT2007> eBay?
[02:25] <VMT2007> :P
[02:25] <Xaphoo> pike_: how do I find that out?
[02:25] <Managu> Xaphoo:  both pressed and burned CDs?
[02:25] <javaJake> VMT2007: and, btw, how would it hurt my system?
[02:25] <tmccrary> javajake: From your description, it sounds like a hardware thing witn your batter
[02:25] <Donogh> am, KBUILD=? please
[02:25] <javaJake> tmccrary: ok, any way to check?
[02:25] <tmccrary> javajake: It could start on fire ;)
[02:25] <VMT2007> overcharging
[02:25] <javaJake> tmitchell: really!?
[02:25] <Xaphoo> Managu: not sure, I don't have any pressed CDs handy right now
[02:25] <VMT2007> or a fire, yes :P
[02:25] <VMT2007> not fun stuff
[02:25] <javaJake> VMT2007: ah, ok, better, uh, plug in then
[02:25] <VMT2007> plug in
[02:25] <VMT2007> and remove the battery
[02:25] <javaJake> Just did
[02:26] <VMT2007> check the connectors
[02:26] <javaJake> What am I looking for?
[02:26] <VMT2007> if they have any white stuff on them, ask someone else how to clean it (I'm not familiar with oxidation on battery terminals)
[02:26] <Managu> Xaphoo: mmmm.  Are the DVDs you've been working with pressed or burned?
[02:26] <jroes> I just installed a wireless card in my ubuntu box, what do I need to do to get it working?
[02:26] <Xaphoo> Managu: both.  Both pressed and burned DVDs work fine
[02:26] <VMT2007> jroes: ubuntu doesn't recognize the device?
[02:26] <Pelo> !wireless | jroes
[02:26] <ubotu> jroes: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:26] <jroes> it's a linksys WMP54G -- do I need to play with ndiswrapper or did it get detected on boot?
[02:27] <VMT2007> hmm
[02:27] <VMT2007> check that link
[02:27] <godzig> trying to upgrade to edgy. upgrade crashed partway through. I'm trying to salvage my files to do a clean install but LiveCD didn't mount any of the drives...how would I do that?
[02:27] <pike_> Xaphoo: you could like sudo head /dev/hdc  then try /dev/cdrom etc if it says cannot open its not an associated node im sure there is a better way though
[02:27] <VMT2007> javaJake: it's quite possibly a problem with hardware
[02:27] <VMT2007> however
[02:27] <javaJake> godzig: edit the /etc/fstab file
[02:27] <VMT2007> you may want to check to be sure with another distribution's live CD
[02:28] <javaJake> godzig: if you tell me what /dev/hda* files the partitions are on, I can make some lines for you you can just punch in.
[02:28] <Managu> Xaphoo: Sounds like a fairly odd problem.  To be honest, I doubt this has anything to do with the software, though.
[02:28] <javaJake> VMT2007: aw, man. really? Do I gotta? :P
[02:28] <jroes> it may have detected it, but I don't know how to give it an SSID to connect to since I'm only at a command line right now until I can install nvtv
[02:28] <VMT2007> javaJake: was your battery accurately reporting earlier?
[02:28] <Xaphoo> pike_ what the hell does sudo head /dev/hdb do?  I just did it and some wierd stuff happened
[02:28] <Xaphoo> my terminal turned to garbage characters
[02:28] <javaJake> VMT2007: it's always reported 0%.
[02:28] <jroes> Xaphoo: it prints out the top 10 lines in /dev/hdb
[02:28] <javaJake> VMT2007: I've had it in for eons.
[02:28] <Xaphoo> oh
[02:29] <VMT2007> javaJake: yeah, the electronic circuitry in the battery must be damaged
[02:29] <jroes> and it's treating /dev/hdb as a file, but it's a device
[02:29] <javaJake> VMT2007: and it wasn't until today (oops, plug came out, HEY BATTERY IS WORKING!) that I discovered my battery's potential
[02:29] <jroes> (but everything in unix is a file technically :))
[02:29] <javaJake> VMT2007: ok... rats.
[02:29] <javaJake> VMT2007: just when I was hoping too.
[02:29] <VMT2007> how old is the laptop
[02:29] <VMT2007> and what manufacturer?
[02:30] <ongeboren> hi there, i just need a live cd, does ubuntu offer this ?
[02:30] <Xaphoo> when I put a CD in it says head: cannot open 'dev/hdb/' for reading: Not a directory... god damnit
[02:30] <Xaphoo> I have to watch movies on my windows box now
[02:30] <Xaphoo> this sucks
[02:30] <erider> what is the GLX
[02:30] <javaJake> VMT2007: Compaq, it's pretty old.
[02:30] <VMT2007> erider: in relation to what?
[02:30] <javaJake> VMT2007: at least 2-3 years.
[02:30] <erider> Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
[02:30] <erider> Could not get a double-buffered GLX RGBA visual
[02:30] <VMT2007> javaJake: your warranty with compaq's probably over by now
[02:31] <tmccrary> joes: ifconfig -a, make sure its up and iwconfig devicename essid "yourapssidname"
[02:31] <erider> I'm getting this error
[02:31] <pike_> Xaphoo: try "file /dev/hdc" little bit better output
[02:31] <SilentDis> bad key binding of the day:  ctrl-alt-f12 - open terminal.  ctrl-alt-backspace - restart x.  oops.  rofl
[02:31] <javaJake> VMT2007: oh yea
[02:31] <javaJake> VMT2007: besides, this laptop was found on the side of the road. Worked once a friend fixed some power-button issues.
[02:31] <Xaphoo> pike_: /dev/hdb: block special (3/64)
[02:31] <VMT2007> oh boy
[02:31] <ongeboren> Xaphoo, you need to have read access to the cdrom, try adding your user to the cdrom group
[02:31] <javaJake> lol
[02:31] <pike_> Xaphoo: what does file /dev/hdb say?
[02:31] <javaJake> VMT2007: why?
[02:31] <pike_> Xaphoo: lol thats prob it
[02:31] <VMT2007> yeah, go shopping for another battery
[02:31] <javaJake> VMT2007: this didn't go through rain or anything
[02:32] <VMT2007> you might find a good deal on ebay
[02:32] <javaJake> VMT2007: heheh, I probably will.
[02:32] <Xaphoo> ongeboren: how do I do that?  What is that?  I can read DVDs just fine
[02:32] <erider> VMT2007: I'm getting an error when trying to run a program
[02:32] <selzy_imut> angga
[02:32] <javaJake> VMT2007: thanks for the help, and preventing a fire.
[02:32] <Xaphoo> pike_: what does that mean to you?
[02:32] <VMT2007> erider: What program?
[02:32] <javaJake> VMT2007: btw, if I haven't gotten a fire for months, have I been lucky?
[02:32] <Xaphoo> it is supposed to have 3 files so that makes sense
[02:32] <Xaphoo> but I can't do anything wiht it
[02:32] <erider> VMT2007: is called factor
[02:32] <VMT2007> javaJake: I've never had a battery-related fire
[02:32] <VMT2007> so I couldn't tell you
[02:32] <javaJake> Ah, OK
[02:32] <javaJake> I've had this thing since... oh... July.
[02:32] <VMT2007> erider: never heard of that.
[02:33] <VMT2007> I can't really help you with that, erider
[02:33] <erider> VMT2007: the program is saying that Xlib: extension "GlX" is missing
[02:33] <pike_> Xaphoo: type "groups"  real quick to make sure youre a member of cdrom or whatever if you are go ahead and do file /dev/hdb real quick to see if thats the correct node
[02:33] <javaJake> erider: did you punch it into your xorg.conf file? glx I mean?
[02:33] <tjb891_> ok, my partition is almost taken up but i have plenty of space on my XP partitian, can i use my gp parted live cd and make my ubuntu partition bigger without a problem?
[02:34] <ongeboren> Xaphoo, in gnome you can do it via a gui via: desktop -> administration -> users and groups
[02:34] <Xaphoo> pike_: yeah I'm cdrom
[02:34] <VMT2007> tjb891_: resizing ntfs partitions is dangerous
[02:34] <erider> VMT2007: no
[02:34] <Donogh> really nice wifi howto: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102
[02:34] <VMT2007> from my experience, anyway
[02:34] <Xaphoo> "file /dev/hdb"  gives me "/dev/hdb: block special (3/64)" so I think it's the right node
[02:34] <tjb891_> no i mean the ubuntu partition, i don't care about the NTFS one
[02:34] <VMT2007> oh
[02:34] <pike_> Xaphoo: if you "file /dev/hdb" does it exist?
[02:35] <pike_> Xaphoo: ok
[02:35] <VMT2007> tjb891_: it should not be a problem
[02:35] <Xaphoo> if I put in a DVD, /dev/hdb  gets mounted
[02:35] <Xaphoo> its the same drive
[02:35] <tjb891_> awsome, another 20 gigs added tommorow night then
[02:36] <MSTK> can anyone suggest to me a program for syncing my iPod on ubuntu?
[02:36] <ongeboren> Xaphoo, maybe your /etc/fstab isn't correct, you should have a "user" in the options of the drives that are mountable by users
[02:36] <SilentDis> !ipod | MSTK
[02:36] <ubotu> MSTK: For information on how to sync and add tracks to your iPod, see the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto
[02:36] <MSTK> thanks :)
[02:36] <Yggdrasil> can somone help me, i have a laptop and when i boot, it stops on loading hardware abstraction daemon hald and then it goes into txt mode and eventualy i can log in but then i have none of my network mounted drives work
[02:36] <VMT2007> man they have those factoids for the most random things
[02:36] <dmr_> does anyone have an alternative download for easyubuntu than the main site as it's down and i can't get it
[02:36] <erider> VMT2007: in the section "module" glx is Loading I think
[02:36] <Donogh> is there some trick to WEP keys?
[02:37] <Donogh> i tried s:
[02:37] <Donogh> please : )
[02:37] <Xaphoo> ongeboren: the same drive works just fine when I put DVDs in, /dev/hdb mounts to /media/cdrom0 ... my fstab says: "/dev/hdb        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0"
[02:37] <ongeboren> Xaphoo, also, try to mount the cdrom as root to see if it's a permissions problem
[02:37] <VMT2007> erider: i don't believe I can help you with that, sorry
[02:37] <SilentDis> !random | VMT2007
[02:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about random - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:37] <pike_> Xaphoo: and sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0 doesnt work ?
[02:37] <pike_> Xaphoo: sorry or hdb
[02:37] <tonyyarusso> Donogh: Make sure you have it set to Hex not ASCII
[02:38] <Donogh> ok thanks
[02:38] <Donogh> just tried that and it logged me out
[02:38] <erider> is there wine for 64bit ubuntu
[02:38] <Xaphoo> "sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0" gives me "mount: No medium found"
[02:38] <Donogh> i'm guessing X crashed
[02:38] <SilentDis> VMT2007: awww, they removed it?  that sucks!  lol  there used to be a 'random factoid' kicked out if you did !random. hehe
[02:38] <Yggdrasil> anyone ,hald ?
[02:38] <jroes> ok so my wireless card is detected, I used iwconfig to set my essid to the essid of my router, what do I do to have it go grab an IP address?  right now I can't ping google or any IP addresses...
[02:39] <Pelo> erin  I don'T think so , there is just the one wine
[02:39] <Pelo> so to speak
[02:39] <Donogh> jroes: i'm right there with ya
[02:39] <ongeboren> Xaphoo, are you sure you have a cd right now in the cdrom ? (just in case)
[02:39] <SilentDis> xaphoo:  those are both mount points
[02:39] <jroes> Donogh: haha :)
[02:39] <SilentDis> xaphoo:  er, devices.
[02:40] <Moosejaw> i have had wine working fine for the past few weeks...i think i messed up...so i did a full remove and delete of the dirs etc...
[02:40] <chris_> <jroes>: Type 'dhclient -1 wlan0' to ask your DHCP router for an IP
[02:40] <Moosejaw> but now when i have tried to reinstall it doesnt create the dirs like it did before and nothing runs properly.
[02:40] <Moosejaw> can someone help?
[02:40] <SilentDis> xaphoo:  usually, if you haven't modified your /etc/fstab, any user can type mount /cdrom and end up with working access to the drive
[02:40] <dmr_> does anyone have an alternative download for easyubuntu than the main site as it's down and i can't get it
[02:40] <jroes> hrm
[02:40] <VMT2007> time to try to install steam on wine
[02:41] <SilentDis> moosejaw:  did you try a sudo apt-get install wine
[02:41] <pike_> Xaphoo: thats a new one on me sorry man do udf works but not iso9660..
[02:41] <Pelo> Moosejaw,  get the .deb file from the download archive page  and inswtall with that
[02:41] <jroes> chris_: looks like it's trying pretty hard but not getting anywhere :/.  it said "wmaster0: unknown hardware address type 801" twice, and now it's trying to DHCPDISCOVER with no success
[02:41] <pike_> do=so
[02:41] <chris_> <jroes>: replace wlan0 in the command I gave with the name of your wifi-card
[02:41] <jroes> do I need to tell it that my wireless network ssid is not broadcast?
[02:41] <Moosejaw> silentsdis yes i did that
[02:41] <jroes> wlan0 is correct according to iwconfig
[02:41] <chris_> type 'iwconfig' to see the name of your wifi card
[02:41] <jroes> wlan0 :)
[02:41] <adaptr> jroes: no, you need to tell it what the SSID is
[02:42] <Moosejaw> i am getting this...
[02:42] <jroes> I did
[02:42] <Moosejaw> Warning: the specified Windows directory L"c:\\windows" is not accessible.
[02:42] <Moosejaw> Warning: the specified System directory L"c:\\windows\\system32" is not accessible.
[02:42] <chris_> yes
[02:42] <jroes> with iwconfig essid baller
[02:42] <jroes> and it shows up in iwconfig
[02:42] <Pelo> Moosejaw,  old on , I will give you a link,  meanwhile uninstall the wine you have installed currentl;y
[02:42] <jroes> "baller" is the name of th network :P
[02:42] <cool-freak> a little help please,whats the best downloading program for linux?
[02:42] <chris_> about the ssid, use iwconfig to configure it manually
[02:42] <Moosejaw> pelo ok
[02:42] <jroes> yup, that's what I did
[02:42] <jroes> maybe I don't have DHCP on.  heh.
[02:42] <chris_> example 'iwconfig wlan0 essid "myssid"'
[02:42] <jroes> I need quotes? hm
[02:42] <chris_> hmm
[02:43] <chris_> can you ping your router?
[02:43] <chris_> no quotes
[02:43] <Trini_Man> I have goten bluetooth to work on my system by my PC cant send to my phone
[02:43] <kwood> Could anyone tell me... I ran xampp... then killed it .. didnt like it... now when i go to /localhost/ it goes to localhost/xampp automatically... anyone know what i need to change?
[02:43] <Pelo> Moosejaw,  make sure you did an "remove completely" using synaptic
[02:43] <jroes> nah, network unreachable
[02:43] <chris_> sorry, I meant no surrounding double-quotes
[02:43] <jroes> np
[02:43] <Pelo> Moosejaw,   use a package from this link  http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/archive/index.html
[02:43] <chris_> hmm, what do you get if you type 'iwconfig wlan0'?
[02:43] <jroes> still an immediate network unreachable
[02:43] <jroes> interesting
[02:43] <Trini_Man> need a good blue tooth program what u all recomend ?
[02:44] <mike1o> i did a " sudo ln -fs /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.1" by mistake... how do i get gcc-4.1 back?
[02:44] <Moosejaw> pelo...ok
[02:44] <jroes> I get a bunch of things about the card -- essid:baller, mode:managed, freq:2.462, fragment, rts, etc.
[02:44] <chris_> does it give you a MAC address for your router?
[02:44] <Moosejaw> unsure the install command with the package tho
[02:44] <jroes> nope
[02:44] <jroes> no MAC
[02:44] <rajiv_nair> !bluetooth | Trini_Man
[02:44] <ubotu> Trini_Man: For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[02:44] <SilentDis> !bluetooth | Trini_Man
[02:44] <rajiv_nair> hehe
[02:44] <chris_> hmm, does your router have MAC-filtering turned on?
[02:44] <jroes> nope
[02:45] <jroes> just bought a new one today, nothing is on, just have ssid broadcast off
[02:45] <Trini_Man> yeah i instal it already thanks
[02:45] <rajiv_nair> silentDIs: GMTA :d
[02:45] <cool-freak> please,can you advise me a downloading program?
[02:45] <Trini_Man> i just cant dend from my PC to my phone
[02:45] <Moosejaw> Pelo:  now what?
[02:45] <chris_> can you temporarily turn on broadcasting?
[02:45] <mike1o> cool-freak, azureus?
[02:45] <Trini_Man> *send
[02:45] <rajiv_nair> cool-fraj: "downloading"??
[02:45] <jroes> chris_: sure I'll give it a shot
[02:45] <kwood> Could anyone tell me... I ran xampp... then killed it .. didnt like it... now when i go to /localhost/ it goes to localhost/xampp automatically... anyone know what i need to change?
[02:45] <rajiv_nair> freak*
[02:46] <Trini_Man> sudo hidd --server
[02:46] <cool-freak> tanks,i have it but its not working
[02:46] <SilentDis> !info d4x | cool-freak
[02:46] <ubotu> d4x: graphical download manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.5.7.1-2 (edgy), package size 706 kB, installed size 2016 kB
[02:46] <Pelo> Moosejaw,  start the .deb package you have downloaded to install it ,  once the install is complete , run  winecfg from the terminal ( before you start any wine app)_,  then close it , and youa re good to go
[02:46] <Trini_Man> my phohne can send the the PC
[02:46] <chris_> OK, after you do that, type 'iwlist wlan0 scan' and see if it lists your router's essid
[02:46] <Trini_Man> but my PC cant find mt phone
[02:46] <Moosejaw> cool.
[02:46] <Moosejaw> thanks
[02:46] <SurfnKid> is there a way to recover the galeon browser from crashing, (its frozen up )
[02:46] <Moosejaw> ill let you know when it works
[02:46] <jroes> ah you know what
[02:46] <Moosejaw> :)
[02:46] <jroes> there are other networks around here
[02:47] <jroes> and I just ran scan (without making mine visible yet), and still nothing shows up
[02:47] <chris_> oh, do you guys have the same essid?
[02:47] <Pelo> Moosejaw,  I prefer to live in ignorance if you donT' mind ...
[02:47] <jroes> but I'm on my laptop on wireless and there are 3 or 4
[02:47] <Trini_Man> whats a good bluetooth program ?
[02:47] <jroes> haha, nah, no one is using that same ssid
[02:47] <SurfnKid> kbluetooth
[02:47] <Donogh> i'm tempted to just disable wep and reconfigure all the windows PCs
[02:47] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, bluez-utils
[02:47] <Trini_Man> ok i will reinstal kbuetooth
[02:47] <jroes> oh.  if I do sudo iwlist wlan0 scan it shows me stuff
[02:47] <chris_> oh, I guess go ahead and enable broadcasting for testing purposes
[02:47] <jroes> my fault
[02:47] <SilentDis> Trini_man:  did you read the link ubotu sent you?
[02:47] <Trini_Man> did not wor  the first time
[02:48] <Trini_Man> yeah man i did that install already
[02:48] <chris_> oh, sorry I forgot it needs root perm.
[02:48] <Trini_Man> it works fine but....
[02:48] <jroes> there we go, shows up in the scan
[02:48] <Trini_Man> i can send from my phoe to my Cell
[02:48] <Trini_Man> PC to Cell
[02:48] <chris_> cool, now type 'sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "yourssid"'
[02:48] <Trini_Man> when i scan i dont dee mt phone
[02:49] <Trini_Man> but my phone can send and find the computer
[02:49] <Jaak_> is there a firewall in ubu? something i should change to open it for mythtv frontends
[02:49] <jroes> chris_: ok, did that, still no pinging of 192.168.1.1 or anything
[02:49] <chris_> jroes: once you do that, then type 'sudo dhclient -1 wlan0'
[02:49] <jroes> very odd
[02:49] <jroes> I'll try the dhclient
[02:49] <Donogh> hmm
[02:49] <Trini_Man> sudo hidd --search
[02:49] <chris_> use sudo
[02:49] <pike_> Jaak_: sudo iptables -L should say outbound forward and input all ACCEPT
[02:49] <jroes> argh!  no dhcp response :/
[02:50] <jroes> used sudo
[02:50] <chris_> hmm, you don't have WEP or any encryption turned on, do you?
[02:50] <jroes> this is crazy man
[02:50] <jroes> nope
[02:50] <Donogh> the WEP is definitely my prob
[02:50] <jroes> I have a linksys wmp54g card, and a linksys wrt54g router
[02:50] <chris_> hey, download wifi-radar and try it out.
[02:51] <Donogh> jroes: me too
[02:51] <chris_> 'sudo apt-get install wifi-radar'
[02:51] <jroes> is it command line?
[02:51] <OmniColos> put dd-wrt on the router ;-)
[02:51] <Donogh> i can't download anything on it 'cause it doesn't have a lan interface
[02:51] <RoC_MM_0w> !vnc
[02:51] <ubotu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[02:51] <jroes> I doubt it's still on my box
[02:51] <chris_> no, GUI
[02:51] <Donogh> the router's running openwrt
[02:51] <jroes> OmniColos: I will, but I've got one of the shitty v6 ones that can only use micro dd-wrt
[02:51] <OmniColos> v6! gads
[02:52] <OmniColos> those bastards
[02:52] <Jaak_> pike, it says http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/autostart.html
[02:52] <Jaak_> ooops
[02:52] <jroes> yeah, I went through all of the boxes at best buy too :P
[02:52] <jroes> checking serial numbers
[02:52] <jroes> haha
[02:52] <OmniColos> hehe
[02:52] <Jaak_> pike, Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)?
[02:52] <Donogh> hehe
[02:52] <OmniColos> I'm really considering a slug
[02:52] <metrix> I just upgraded a Dell poweredge 4600 server to edgy, and now my X does not work, I do not see an error in the log files, can anyone point me in some directions to look?
[02:52] <Donogh> ok, the gloves are off; wep's going down
[02:52] <Donogh> i guess i can turn off the ssid broadcast
[02:52] <Donogh> pseudo-security
[02:52] <RoC_MM_0w> jroes, you can find them cheaper on ebay
[02:53] <metrix> oh, BTW I am using GDM
[02:53] <craigbass1976> Can someone help me spread the word?  I'm going to a meet and greet this week for business owners and will be talking with them about open source.  I want to make a cd that when popped into a windows box will make an html document pop up with a brief intro and links to software (open office and stuff) that I put on the disc for them to install and try out.
[02:53] <jroes> chris_: I can only use something that will work from a term
[02:53] <sanityx> If I install Ubuntu 7.04 Alpha, and keep installing updates as they come out, will it eventually become the Release version when 7.04 comes out in april, or will I have to do a resintall/dist-upgrade?
[02:53] <chris_> <metrix>: try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[02:53] <pike_> Jaak_: yeah it should say that for inbound and outbound as well. if it does your firewall is for all intents an purposes off.
[02:54] <chris_> jroes: ah, understood
[02:54] <metrix> chris_ ok will do! brb
[02:54] <pike_> Jaak_: so its not a firewall problem
[02:54] <jroes> once I get on the internet with it I can get nvtv and then use X
[02:54] <jroes> :)
[02:55] <Managu> craigbass1976: sounds fun
[02:55] <Catshrimp> Wondering how I would get a flat sort of style in X rather than the default 3d buttons and stuff?
[02:55] <La_PaRCa> craigbass1976, you might want to take a look at The Open CD @ thopencd.org
[02:55] <chris_> jroes: Does iwconfig give you the MAC address of your router now?
[02:55] <SurfnKid> if you're connected to it YES
[02:55] <SurfnKid> chris_, do "iwlist scan"
[02:55] <Trini_Man> whats the KDE bluethooth program again ?
[02:56] <Solarion> anyone know why the printer admin utility wouldn't actually change the printer paper option from A4 to Letter?
[02:56] <jroes> chris - nope, but scan does
[02:56] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, kbluetoothd
[02:56] <jroes> SurfnKid: chris is helping me ;)
[02:56] <Solarion> The dialogs say it's changed, but cups syas it's not.
[02:56] <sanityx> If I install Ubuntu 7.04 Alpha, and keep installing updates as they come out, will it eventually become the Release version when 7.04 comes out in april, or will I have to do a resintall/dist-upgrade?
[02:56] <Trini_Man> thanks
[02:56] <SurfnKid> oh :P
[02:56] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, I found the hidd --search was much better
[02:56] <jroes> iwlist scan will show the mac address, but my iwconfig won't
[02:56] <jroes> very very weird
[02:56] <chris_> hmm, any special configurations on the router-side?
[02:57] <Trini_Man> yeah
[02:57] <starz> right
[02:57] <Trini_Man> but i cant find my phone
[02:57] <metrix> chris_: wow. xserver-xorg was not even installed! I wonder how that happened :/ thank you for the help!
[02:57] <jroes> completely default as far as I know
[02:57] <Trini_Man> for some reason
[02:57] <pip> !lyn
[02:57] <jroes> my osx laptop didn't need any special configuration to connect right up to it
[02:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lyn - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:57] <starz> so i just upgraded to edgy and im noticing a few wierd things when i type: ^ to get that charactor i have to do shift+6 twice not once etc
[02:57] <pip> !lync
[02:57] <chris_> metrix: haha, no problem.  Hope you get it back up.
[02:57] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, is your bluetooth running ?  lsusb
[02:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lync - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:57] <Trini_Man> yes
[02:57] <Solarion> anyone?
[02:57] <starz> any clue how to fix? i mean im sure its a kb map but which one do i need for usa / 104key
[02:57] <pip> !elinks
[02:57] <sanityx> !fiesty
[02:57] <Trini_Man> it works fine in terms of that

[02:58] <chris_> jroes: can you paste the essid line from the output of iwconfig?
[02:58] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, you might need a key
[02:58] <starz> that one is awesome
[02:58] <jroes> chris_: I can type it :)
[02:58] <starz> pip, nbd
[02:58] <chris_> or that too, lol
[02:58] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, I've only got hid devices running. for i.e. mouse didnt need a passkey, but your phone might
[02:58] <jroes> chris_: one sec, I'm rebooting in case I screwed anything up earlier when I was running some ifup/ifdown cmds
[02:58] <chris_> ok
[02:58] <jroes> I doubt I did though, I only ran ifdown eth0 and ifup wlan0 :P
[02:59] <Trini_Man> yeah it needs one
[02:59] <SurfnKid> ah
[02:59] <chris_> yeah, I doubt it too
[02:59] <Donogh2> hmm
[02:59] <Trini_Man> how do i tell the system what the passkey is

[03:02] <Trini_Man> i juss teling u i still here
[03:02] <Xaphoo> what makes this so wierd is that my DVDs work fine
[03:02] <jsilva> hi all
[03:03] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, /etc/default/bluez-utils is used for mouse and keyboard devices, you might want to try looking in the hci** manuals so you can set up a passkey on start up and let the PC know how to sync
[03:03] <Donogh2> unrecognised wireless request "essidname"
[03:03] <Trini_Man> humm
[03:03] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid oooook
[03:03] <jroes> hrm
[03:03] <SurfnKid> :)
[03:03] <jsilva> is it possible in gnome keep windows in background even if it is clicked inside? like xfce
[03:03] <_tcc> What is the name of the GNOME core package?
[03:04] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid so how come i can send stuff to the PC
[03:04] <_tcc> I am remastering an ubuntu ISO, with reconstructor.
[03:04] <pike_> jw_606: http://tremulous.info
[03:04] <_tcc> I want to remove GNOME totally.
[03:04] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, i think the pc can see it but it doesnt know how to decipher the device
[03:04] <Xaphoo> tremulous is really fun
[03:04] <Donogh2> oops
[03:04] <Xaphoo> It's much better than I expected a free fps to be
[03:04] <Donogh2> ok
[03:05] <bimberi> cloakable: :(
[03:05] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid i am using something called bluetooth file sharing
[03:05] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, look at  "man hcid.conf"
[03:05] <jroes> what's the -1 in dhclient do?
[03:05] <Trini_Man> k
[03:05] <Donogh2> after running that command, essid is still off/any
[03:05] <Donogh2> bed time for me
[03:05] <Donogh2> gone 2am here
[03:05] <jroes> weird
[03:05] <jroes> alright, seeya
[03:05] <chris_> jroes, the -1 tells dhclient to try only once
[03:05] <Donogh2> i think i'll have to go back to ndis
[03:05] <_tcc> Anyone?
[03:05] <_tcc> Hello?
[03:05] <chris_> you can leave it off
[03:05] <_tcc> What is the name of the GNOME core package?
[03:06] <Donogh2> and maybe trail a 100ft eth cable across the house
[03:06] <Donogh2> through even
[03:06] <jroes> chris_: ah, yes, that's what I tried
[03:06] <TheMoebius-Windo> hey guys, I'm running a small web server to host a few websites and I've got problems on domain resolution stuff. Does anyone here run a webhost that is knowledgeable in DNS policies?
[03:06] <Donogh2> thanks for all the help!
[03:06] <jroes> chris_: and now it's trying eth0 as well :P
[03:06] <Donogh2> you haven't seen the last of this man!!!
[03:06] <tmccrary> !sexytime

[03:07] <jroes> hrm
[03:07] <chris_> oh
[03:07] <jroes> what is this wifi assistant crap?
[03:07] <haary> _tcc: there is no such thing as a gnome core package
[03:07] <LjL> !bot abuse | tmccrary
[03:07] <ubotu> tmccrary: Please don't play with the bots, or else... Also see !behaviour and !msgthebot
[03:07] <jroes> this guy had a similar problem -- http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=265512&page=3
[03:07] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, man hcitool <-- might help too, I havnet tried setting up a Bluetooth phone but I know it uses a passkey and if you have it you can set it up
[03:07] <chris_> try 'sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "ssid"'
[03:07] <tmccrary> Ljl, thanks for the heads up, I APPRECIATE IT
[03:07] <jsilva> :|
[03:07] <chris_> then right afterwards, try 'sudo dhclient wlan0'
[03:08] <haary> _tcc: but you cat try apt-cache search libgnome
[03:08] <LjL> tmccrary: and i'm not sure i appreciate your apparent sarcasm
[03:08] <jroes> :/   no DHCP response from the DHCPDISCOVERs
[03:08] <jsilva> I want the xfce focus abilities in gnome :s
[03:08] <FreeNet> it's so depressing... other linux distro's help channel basically don't help much
[03:08] <jroes> why doesn't my router like me!
[03:08] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid we should have the same pin code
[03:08] <Clarrisa_2008> is running xchat dangerous? or in other words, if I have chosen in it's configuration to connect via ssl, is it dangerous?
[03:08] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid : *passkey
[03:08] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, yep
[03:09] <bimberi> _tcc: yes, look at libgnome, or perhaps even libglib (in the package name)
[03:09] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid i know in the config file i have set it
[03:09] <LjL> heh
[03:09] <Trini_Man> humm
[03:09] <Trini_Man> ok
[03:09] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid i going to try something
[03:09] <tmccrary> I meant that with total sincerity, from the bottom of my heart. I am going to write a poem in your honor, give me a second
[03:09] <Solarion> no, seriously, what the heck?
[03:09] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, ok

[03:09] <tmccrary> APPRECIATE IT
[03:09] <chris_> jroes: did you surround you ssid with dbl-quotes?
[03:09] <jroes> yup
[03:09] <RedBaron> i tried Envy to install the lastest drivers for my nvidia gforce 6200le and it said the drivers werent compatible with the card... then it said if i wanted to continue... i hited yes... the the screen turned black aand i could only enter the console... had to reinstall ubuntu... now what driver repos can i use for my card... i want a stable version of the 9xxx drivers that would work with BERYL.
[03:09] <Solarion> why does gnome-cups-manager not change anything other tha nadding a printer?
[03:09] <chris_> sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "ssid"
[03:10] <chris_> hmm
[03:10] <Pelo> ...
[03:10] <chris_> you made sure the case of the ssid was correct?
[03:10] <bimberi> 0_o
[03:10] <jroes> yup
[03:11] <jroes> I'm about to reset everything to defaults on the router
[03:11] <chris_> funny, I was going to ask you to try that
[03:11] <Solarion> anyone?  Printing?
[03:11] <jroes> ;)
[03:12] <_tcc> How can I totally remove openoffice.org?

[03:12] <Pelo> Solarion,  what was your question ?
[03:12] <_tcc> Because I don't want it.
[03:12] <_tcc> It's heavy and gross.
[03:12] <rajiv_nair> -tcc: dnt tell me u runnin MS office with wine
[03:12] <chris_> _tcc: do an 'apt-cache search openoffice | grep -i openoffice' and remove away
[03:12] <Solarion> _tcc: fire up synaptica package manager, search for openoffice, set all installed bits to un-install
[03:12] <_tcc> I'm not running any office :)
[03:13] <rajiv_nair> _tcc: ohhhhh:d
[03:13] <RedBaron> i tried Envy to install the lastest drivers for my nvidia gforce 6200le and it said the drivers werent compatible with the card... then it said if i wanted to continue... i hited yes... the the screen turned black aand i could only enter the console... had to reinstall ubuntu... now what driver repos can i use for my card... i want a stable version of the 9xxx drivers that would work with BERYL.
[03:13] <Solarion> _tcc: System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manger
[03:13] <rajiv_nair> _tcc: synaptic it is:)
[03:13] <Solarion> Pelo: I don't know why gnome-cups-manager is not setting printer properties.
[03:13] <schisms> I have a question about duel booting.
[03:13] <Clarrisa_2008> what is a better ms office replacement other than openoffice?
[03:13] <Pelo> Solarion,  I can'T help you there , sorry
[03:14] <_tcc> So what would the command be for that?
[03:14] <schisms> I installed zenwalk on the 10 gigs of free hd space I have.
[03:14] <rajiv_nair> _tcc: heavy and gross....ever seen a thing called windows :> ??
[03:14] <Solarion> Pelo: I open the "Properties" and change things, and they remain changed for gnome-print-manager, but it isn't changed in cups.  :(
[03:14] <schisms> And when I rebooted
[03:14] <Pelo> Clarrisa_2008, better ?? none,  but I hear koffice is not bad
[03:14] <schisms> I couldn't get into the ubuntu os switcher.
[03:14] <Clarrisa_2008> hmm
[03:14] <_tcc> chris_: what would the command be?
[03:14] <_tcc> And yes, I've seen windows.
[03:14] <_tcc> It's nice.
[03:14] <_tcc> rofl
[03:14] <rajiv_nair> _tcc: no command
[03:14] <_tcc> No, I need the command.
[03:14] <schisms> Anyone have an answer?
[03:14] <_tcc> I am chrooted.
[03:14] <Acu> greetings: I have a mutipart zipped file with file1.zip file1.z01 and file1.z02 I uncompress the file.zip file and I got a cue file and a bin file and now I do not know what to do (it is  supposse to be a CD maybe iso file at the end) any sugestion what is bin and cue is appreciated
[03:15] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid whats Bluetooth (OBEX) ?
[03:15] <schisms> I need to know how to be able to install a second os with the os switcher.
[03:15] <rajiv_nair> _tcc: open synaptic, check the installed section....mark anythin related to open office for uninstalling
[03:15] <_tcc> I am in a chrooted dir, i am remastering the ubuntu iso
[03:15] <Pelo> Clarrisa_2008,   you can also try gnome office, which is not an actualy suite but a series of apps that add up to a suite,  look it up on wikipedia for the full list
[03:15] <_tcc> i can't open it
[03:15] <chris_> <Clarrisa_2008>: try abiword, gnumeric
[03:15] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid tje PC says sendign file as OBEX
[03:15] <_tcc> chris_: what is the command?
[03:15] <_tcc> for the piping and whatnot?
[03:15] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, its an object initiaion program i dont know much about
[03:15] <ricardo> hey, my wirless connection is much more slower in Ubuntu as compared to the other OS I have in my computer. Has it ever happend to any of you guys?
[03:15] <SurfnKid> oh right, it has to be OBEX compatible
[03:16] <SurfnKid> kbluetoothd installs OBEX
[03:16] <schisms> I need a way to switch between os' after having ubuntu already installed.
[03:16] <Trini_Man> know it keeps searching ....
[03:16] <Trini_Man> i left it
[03:16] <haary> Acu: with cdrdao you can burn this file to a cdrom
[03:16] <Solarion> Pelo: thanks for responding anyway.  :(
[03:16] <Pelo> schisms,  grub
[03:16] <schisms> Any ideas?
[03:16] <Clarrisa_2008> first time i've heard of complaints as from _tcc about openoffice.... I thought it was pretty cool.... but to each his/her own
[03:16] <jroes> ugh. crap
[03:16] <schisms> alright.
[03:16] <Trini_Man> and it found the phone but it ttaking forever
[03:16] <jroes> so I reset it, still nothing
[03:16] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, do you dual boot? try in XP
[03:16] <chris_> _tcc: sorry,  'sudo apt-get --purge remove openoffice*'
[03:16] <jroes> are there known issues with 2.6.17 ?
[03:16] <Trini_Man> yeah it should work in XP
[03:17] <Pelo> Clarrisa_2008,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_office
[03:17] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid<i want to use it in ubuntu
[03:17] <Clarrisa_2008> pelo, I'll check it out
[03:17] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, I tried a passkey or pin with my  mouse but it didnt need one. Phones might require one, so if it works in XP it should work in Ubuntu
[03:17] <Trini_Man> k
[03:17] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, try looking in the forums for resolutions that might have already worked
[03:18] <ubun> instead of making a dual boot ubuntu/kbuntu system is there a way i can choose to load either gnome or kde when i login or something
[03:18] <Managu> RedBaron: 6200 LE?  I'm having a tough time finding reference to it.  Not a 6600 LE?
[03:18] <Jeffm515> is there a single command to monitor all network traffic?
[03:18] <Jeffm515> not just my machines..
[03:18] <_tcc> tcpdump -X
[03:18] <_tcc> lol
[03:18] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, or email the kbluetoothd developer, he might be the best source of information to your specific problem :)
[03:18] <Jeffm515> all traffice
[03:18] <Jeffm515> sweet
[03:18] <pike_> ubun: at login just click sessions button
[03:18] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid yeah this is what happeed ... i to resetablis a remationship with the computer
[03:18] <RedBaron> MANAGU Its a 6200LE
[03:18] <ubun> pike_ does that mean i can even have other things like xfce, beryl, fluxbox, etc?
[03:18] <chris_> _tcc, you get the command?
[03:18] <RedBaron> sorry
[03:18] <_tcc> Err, well yeah, all traffic on a shared segment.
[03:19] <Trini_Man> then my laptop showed up on the Send file pgogram
[03:19] <_tcc> And you need to put it into promisc mode.
[03:19] <_tcc> christ_: yes
[03:19] <_tcc> thanks
[03:19] <Clarrisa_2008> LJL, I'm curious... how does that tmcrary guy keep connecting... I thought if they were banned it would get their IP address and stop them from reconnecting under a different name

[03:21] <rajiv_nair> allz: then run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[03:21] <tonyyarusso> cafuego_: I made an opping booboo at his expense, and wanted to apologize and make sure he knew what happened.
[03:21] <Allz> rajiv_nair please is there no either way ?

[03:22] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid i had to refresh the relationship on my phone
[03:22] <SurfnKid> yep you have to
[03:22] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid its a stupid thing on WM5

[03:23] <Trini_Man> lol

[03:23] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid thign is my phone wont show the a file is being send unless i referesh
[03:23] <SurfnKid> Ubuntu might be a little hard to get it running initially, but you might notice that its very stable afterwards
[03:23] <Trini_Man> SurfnKid this only happens with the computer though not other devices
[03:24] <SurfnKid> Trini_Man, ahh, look at the manual, or google forums about that phone
[03:24] <rajiv_nair> allz: it aint anythin dangerous.dnt wrry :D

[03:26] <whyameye> SurfnKid: as in the temperature

[03:26] <Managu> RedBaron: http://www.nvidia.com/ -- look for the "download drivers" tab.  I suspect that you're looking for Linux drivers for the IA32 archetecture
[03:26] <Agatha_> people
[03:27] <rajiv_nair> agatha_: listenin :)
[03:27] <chris_> <whyameye>: Does 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' give you that info?
[03:27] <RedBaron> Yes
[03:27] <Agatha_> people
[03:27] <Agatha_> need .net channels
[03:27] <whyameye> chris_: it doesn't appear to. My kernel is giving me warnings that I am above the threshold and I am remotely logged into it.
[03:28] <niko_m19> hello
[03:28] <rajiv_nair> #.net :D??
[03:28] <Agatha_> people
[03:28] <chris_> whyameye: do you know if that feature is supported by your BIOS?
[03:28] <Agatha_> people
[03:28] <whyameye> chris_: well if it weren't, how come the kernel is reporting too high a temp?
[03:28] <SurfnKid> whyameye, cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*
[03:28] <whyameye> this is a new problem
[03:28] <chris_> oh, duh, sorry
[03:29] <Xaphoo> does anyone have any idea about my CD-rom problem?  I can't read CDs for some reason, though I can write them and I can read and write DVDs just fine.  CDs don't seem to be able to mount
[03:29] <niko_m19> can i run ubuntu off my usb external hard drive  how do i do that?
[03:29] <niko_m19> how do i have to partition it?
[03:29] <SurfnKid> whyameye, thats if yer machine supports acpi
[03:29] <chris_> Xaphoo: how are you mounting them? And is it a music CD or data CD?
[03:29] <whyameye> SurfnKid: there's nothing in that directory, although the directory does exist. How did you find that, BTW?
[03:30] <Managu> niko_m19: Should be possible, if your machine supports booting from a USB HDD
[03:30] <SurfnKid> whyameye, just remembered that I was setting up my acpi thermal sensor in the panel
[03:30] <SurfnKid> whyameye, what does /proc/acpi contain?
[03:30] <rajiv_nair> rofl
[03:31] <whyameye> SurfnKid: some files and directories...wading through them now...
[03:31] <SurfnKid> Agatha_, yes Agatha_
[03:31] <niko_m19> i don't know managu got to check my bios i guess
[03:31] <Agatha_> any .net channels?
[03:31] <Managu> niko_m19: yup
[03:31] <niko_m19> i doubt it though its only a p3 966
[03:31] <SurfnKid> whyameye, cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/* should give ya everything there
[03:31] <Allz> rajiv_nair thanks
[03:31] <cafuego_> Agatha_: .net is windows, you're on a Linux channel.
[03:32] <Allz> rajiv_nair it is working fine
[03:32] <rajiv_nair> allz: never a problem :)
[03:32] <Allz> rajiv_nair but now i want to make it even smaller
[03:32] <rajiv_nair> allz: increase resolution :D
[03:32] <Allz> yeah
[03:32] <rajiv_nair> allz: which res u using now??
[03:32] <Allz> dno
[03:32] <Agatha_> [04:31:55]  <cafuego_> Agatha_: .net is windows, you're on a Linux channel.
[03:32] <Managu> niko_m19: I'd have to agree with your assessment.  There are still ways to make it work, but they're tricky.  As always, Google is your friend.
[03:32] <chris_> whyameye: try cat-ing the file under /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THR*
[03:32] <Allz> rajiv_nair how to check XD
[03:33] <mattfletcher> I want to create a customised Ubuntu CD with install questions pre-answered, a custom set of packages, and custom themes and backgrounds. What is the best method of doing this? I've seen a number of possibilities but I am not knowledgable enough to work out which is best.
[03:33] <Agatha_> do you know about mono?
[03:33] <cafuego_> Agatha_: Yes, try #mono
[03:33] <cafuego_> Agatha_: Ask for mono then, not .net
[03:33] <Xaphoo> chris_: both don't work... mount /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0 says "no medium found"
[03:33] <SurfnKid> mattfletcher, look in the forums for customized Ubuntu CDs
[03:33] <whyameye> chris_, SurfnKid: there are no files at all in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone. The directory exists and it contains no files.
[03:33] <mike1o> how do i share my internet connection?
[03:34] <Pelo> mike1o,  just be selfish
[03:34] <SurfnKid> whyameye, then acpi isnt configured properly to read all those variables
[03:34] <mike1o> Pelo, heheh!!
[03:34] <chris_> whyameye: dang, cause that's how I get my cpu temp
[03:34] <xzk> I think I'm doing something wrong - I downloaded Adobe Flash player 9 from adobe's website, and I extracted the flashplayer.so file... and I tried to cut and paste it into my /mozilla/plugins folder but it wont let me cut and paste it for some reason
[03:34] <SurfnKid> whyameye, whats in /proc/acpi? anything
[03:34] <chris_> Xaphoo: If it's a music CD, you can't mount it
[03:34] <rajiv_nair> azk: run "sudo nautilus" and try cut pastin in that
[03:35] <factboy818181> hello, for some reason, something keeps on using up my internet connection - is there anyway to find out which process?
[03:35] <whyameye> chris_, SurfnKid: in /proc I did "sudo find . | grep -i temp" and I found nothing of interest. So I'm dead in the water with this, huh??
[03:35] <Managu> factboy818181: at a terminal, try "netstat -tp"
[03:35] <Xaphoo> chris_: it's a data cd
[03:35] <SurfnKid> weird
[03:36] <chris_> Xaphoo: do you get an error from mount?
[03:36] <SurfnKid> whyameye, pretty decent pc or old clunker?
[03:36] <Allz> rajiv_nair i am on 1024x768 , i cant go higher in the section
[03:36] <whyameye> SurfnKid: old clunker. 1.5 Gz PIV made for Win98.
[03:36] <SurfnKid> ah
[03:36] <SurfnKid> whyameye, that might be why the acpi might not be reading well
[03:36] <Allz> rajiv_nair so i am askin how to go higher to make my screen small
[03:37] <SurfnKid> whyameye, the mobo might support acpi but might have to load and mod stuff for the kernel
[03:37] <whyameye> SurfnKid: I think I just won't worry about it for now. Next time I am in the room w/ the box I'll make sure the fans are spinning.
[03:37] <rajiv_nair> allz: "make ur screen smaller" ??
[03:37] <SurfnKid> whyameye, whats the BIOS say? if the temp is normal there, dont worry
[03:37] <Allz> rajiv_nair yeah
[03:37] <xzk> rajiv_nair:   what is nautilus
[03:37] <chris_> Xaphoo: try 'sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0'
[03:37] <whyameye> SurfnKid: the computer is housed in an area that's hard for me to get to. But I'll have to take a trip there tomorrow or something...
[03:37] <Allz> rajiv_nair it is so big , for my eyez :(
[03:38] <SurfnKid> whyameye, oh ok
[03:38] <rajiv_nair> !nautilus | xzk
[03:38] <ubotu> nautilus: file manager and graphical shell for GNOME. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 586 kB, installed size 1424 kB
[03:38] <SurfnKid> brb
[03:38] <rajiv_nair> allz: try setting a high res in xorg.conf
[03:38] <pike_> xzk: you basically need root priv to copy to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
[03:38] <factboy818181> Managu: in system monitor, it says i'm sending 15 - 20 KB/s - none of my cron jobs are active and utorrent isn't using that much right now
[03:39] <Allz> rajiv_nair how to open up xorg.conf
[03:39] <xzk> pike_: howcome I don't already have root priv ?
[03:39] <rajiv_nair> to reconfigure xorg.conf
[03:39] <rajiv_nair> run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" from terminal
[03:39] <Boelcke> Why does the command line show these funny question mark characters (in an html file), while gedit shows them as spaces? 
[03:39] <rajiv_nair> allz: u on nvidia rite??
[03:39] <Xaphoo> "sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0" says "mount: no medium found"
[03:39] <xzk> ah damn.. I closed the terminal window and it closed nautilus too :(
[03:39] <mattfletcher> surfnkid: what i really want is a definitive, objective answer "use tool foobar"
[03:40] <rajiv_nair> xzk: leave the terminal window open :D
[03:40] <xzk> how do I get root priv's
[03:40] <mattfletcher> surfnkid: the forums just give more suggestions
[03:40] <pike_> xzk: that would be bad you dont want them all the time. open a terminal and type gksudo nautilus    and hit enter that window will be able to write to the directory like rajiv_nair said
[03:40] <Xaphoo> chris_: but "file /dev/hdb" says /dev/hdb: block special (3/64)"
[03:40] <chris_> Xaphoo: looks like your CD-ROM drive can't read the CD
[03:40] <Boelcke> xzk, sudo su
[03:40] <xzk> whats the difference between sudo and gksudo
[03:40] <SurfnKid> mattfletcher, yeah i know, well just keep asking around I really dont know the answer to that although there are a lot here who do
[03:40] <Xaphoo> chris_: why might that be?  ALL my CDs are like this... and all my DVDs are fine
[03:40] <Managu> factboy818181: They've released uTorrent for linux?
[03:40] <SurfnKid> xzk, graphical and cli
[03:40] <Allz> rajiv_nair yes
[03:41] <Xaphoo> chris_: and the drive works fine when I'm in Windows, and burns ISOs just fine
[03:41] <xzk> Managu: not yet
[03:41] <rajiv_nair> select nvidia for the first question it asks
[03:41] <pike_> xzk: gksudo is considered safer to use in a gui
[03:41] <mattfletcher> anyone got a definitive answer for the best tool to create a custom ubuntu cd?
[03:41] <Managu> xzk: didn't think so.  Which has me confused at your statement.
[03:41] <pike_> xzk: both will work
[03:41] <Xaphoo> chris_: or at least it used to be able to burn ISOs, I haven't tried it recently
[03:41] <xzk> Managu: BitTorrent acquired uTorrent, and it will be ported to Mac and Linux :)
[03:41] <Managu> xzk: doh, sorry
[03:42] <rajiv_nair> xzk: nice
[03:42] <xzk> yep
[03:42] <Managu> xzk: caught the wrong handle
[03:42] <judgen> xzk: no point, MacOSX And BeOS has transmission. No need to port uTorrent there
[03:42] <rajiv_nair> xzk i missd utorrent after i moved from xp
[03:42] <mike1o> is there a dreamweaver equivalent in ubuntu?
[03:42] <pike_> xzk: i never actually use gksudo but i always tell other people to to avoid problems
[03:42] <rajiv_nair> the only thing i missd:d
[03:42] <xzk> me too rajic
[03:42] <spuri0s> anyone interested helping me here?
[03:42] <xzk> rajiv*
[03:42] <mattfletcher> mike1o: try quanta plus
[03:42] <Boelcke> Anyone know why "more" shows these funny question mark characters (in an html file), while gedit shows them as spaces? 
[03:42] <Managu> factboy818181: I guess I'm a bit confused... are you running Windows?
[03:43] <chris_> Xaphoo: what does 'cdrecord -checkdrive' say?
[03:43] <Boelcke> spuri0s, sure, what's the question...
[03:43] <rajiv_nair> brb
[03:43] <Allz> rajiv_nair i am waiting :)
[03:43] <rajiv_nair> allz: i tld u
[03:43] <Madpilot> SurfnKid, kill the np script, please
[03:43] <HLM> has Edgy been updated yet ?
[03:43] <Allz> rajiv_nair ha?
[03:43] <spuri0s> i've just downloaded ubuntu and i'm trying to run the livecd/downloadcd, but it stops at the "loading" when i press start or install Ubuntu
[03:43] <SurfnKid> Madpilot, that wasnt intended for this channel :)
[03:43] <rajiv_nair> allz: select nvidia for the first question ur askd
[03:43] <xzk> so gksudo is better than sudo for pasting flashplayer.so into /mozilla/plugins ?   and just trying to get my Scrybe account up and working in Linux :)
[03:44] <Trevinho> anyone here can help me with regex (expr)?
[03:44] <rajiv_nair> allz: wen u run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:44] <chris_> xzk: no
[03:44] <spuri0s> i could try burning the ISO again, but i'm not sure if it'll help
[03:44] <Boelcke> Trevinho, that's partially why I'm in here.  Fire away...
[03:44] <rajiv_nair> then wen it asks for res....try settin a higher resolution
[03:44] <xzk> chris_: for reals?
[03:44] <xzk> chris_: just sudo ?
[03:45] <Xaphoo> chris_: http://pastebin.ca/274944
[03:45] <spuri0s> noone?
[03:45] <rajiv_nair> brb
[03:45] <chris_> yes, sudo is command-line, gksudo is GUI front-end
[03:45] <SurfnKid> Madpilot, how'd ya notice i had the script?
[03:45] <Gesthemene> Hi guys, I've only just installed a linux distro for the first time this morning. I'm struggling somewhat with how to configure the touchscreen functionality on my
[03:45] <judgen> xzk: gksudo is graphical sudo is CLI
[03:45] <Trevinho> Boelcke have you seen the query?
[03:45] <Gesthemene> C200 travelmate. Is there anyone who can lend a hand please?
[03:46] <spuri0s> Boelcke: did you see my question?
[03:46] <xzk> CLI ?
[03:46] <pike_> xzk: if i wanted to cp file /etc/file id use sudo if i wanted to launch an app like firefox as root for some reason id gksudo firefox
[03:46] <xzk> command line something
[03:46] <xzk> interface
[03:46] <Boelcke> spuri0s, yes.  You're stuck at loading.  Um, loading kernel?
[03:46] <SurfnKid> xzk, Command Line Interface
[03:46] <chris_> xzk: sorry, what are you trying to do?
[03:46] <judgen> I tried ubuntu from a xfs filesystem today. And gosh darnit that was fast.. just too bad i cant get used to lilo or i would have been in xfs land tright now =)
[03:47] <SurfnKid> xzk, its the Anti-Microsoft do it yourself technique
[03:47] <spuri0s> Boelcke: you're talking too a linux/BIOS n00b here, take it easy!
[03:47] <wickedpuppy> SurfnKid is listening to  - S K Y . F M - Mostly Classical - Listen and Relax, it's good for you! www.sky.fm - Telemann - Concerto polonois in G major for Strings and Basso Continuo, TWV 43;G7 <---- SurfnKid it showed right here in this channel...
[03:47] <chris_> Xaphoo: what does 'ls -l /dev/cdrw' point to?
[03:47] <tonio_> anyone want to help me set up my wireless
[03:47] <spuri0s> Boelcke: it's the windows XP
[03:47] <SurfnKid> wickedpuppy, back off!!!!! it wasnt intended for this channel OK MY BAD
[03:47] <Boelcke> spuri0s, I'm just looking for any more info on what you're seeing when it hangs...
[03:47] <SurfnKid> JESUS FN CHRIST
[03:47] <Agatha_> too few peoples in #mono
[03:47] <xzk> chris_: I've got a Scrybe account that I use in WinXP, and I want to use it in Linux, but it tells me I need to get Flashplayer 8.. only there is no 8 so I need 9 and I don't know how to install it.. or I do I just can't get it to work correctly
[03:47] <wickedpuppy> ?
[03:47] <chris_> Xaphoo: try 'sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrw /media/cdrom0'
[03:47] <pike_> judgen: make /tmp a sep partition and format with xfs best of both worlds
[03:48] <SurfnKid> I suddenly  make a simple mistake in a script and everyone runs to knock me down
[03:48] <Boelcke> spuri0s, this has not much to do with your question, but have you tried any other linux boot cds succesfully on this computer?
[03:48] <Pelo> !flash9 | xzk
[03:48] <ubotu> xzk: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[03:48] <chris_> xzk: oooh. ok.  hold on...
[03:48] <SurfnKid> wickedpuppy, sorry bro
[03:48] <FunnyMan3595> I'm trying to get a working custom kernel out of apt-get's kernel-source (2.4.27) on a dapper install (2.6.15-27).  The change is pretty minor, just an added hook for a modular system call, for a school project.  I've got a "working" kernel now, but when I try to insmod my test module, it reports unresolved symbols that I am sure should be there (printk and sys_call_table).  What have I screwed up?
[03:48] <tonio_> any one want to help with wireless
[03:48] <Xaphoo> chris_: ls -l /dev/cdrw gives lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2006-12-10 16:50 /dev/cdrw -> hdb
[03:48] <wickedpuppy> SurfnKid, but you wanted to know how Madpilot knows you got the script :P so i answered ... its ok
[03:48] <SurfnKid> wickedpuppy, i thought you were coming strong on the whole script that wasnt intended
[03:49] <SurfnKid> wickedpuppy, oh duh, sorry
[03:49] <spuri0s> Boelcke: i get the menu, and when I press the first (and the second) choice, it goes loading in the top corner and nothing more happens.. for half an hour. No, no other distros or cds tried
[03:49] <Xaphoo> chris_: " sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrw /media/cdrom0" gives "mount: no medium found"
[03:49] <chris_> <Xaphoo>: Oh, nevermind then.  sorry
[03:49] <Pelo> xzk,  I can dcc you a .deb package of flash 9 beta if you want
[03:49] <SurfnKid> Thanks for answering back Madpilot
[03:49] <SurfnKid> :)
[03:49] <FunnyMan3595> The other (possibly diagnostic, though noncritical) problem I'm hitting is that aside from the root partition, nothing's getting mounted.  The /dev/hdX's don't even exist until I create them by hand.
[03:49] <judgen> xzk: download the flashplayer9 tar file unpack it in terminal with "tar -zxvf flashplayerblahfilenameorsomething.tar.gz" then you move the file to a folder in your home folder called .mozilla/plugins
[03:49] <Xaphoo> ugh
[03:49] <Xaphoo> probably a new cdrom drive will fix problems
[03:50] <Gesthemene> Anyone know how to configure touchscreen functionality under Ubuntu?
[03:50] <Xaphoo> but otherwise me and everyone else seems to be at a loss
[03:50] <xzk> Pelo: where did you get a .deb for it!
[03:50] <Boelcke> spuri0s, I'm no expert here, but I've got two things that I know I would do next, in your shoes.  One, go download damnsmalllinux.  It's a small liveCD that you might try first.
[03:50] <exeakiel> How would I change the default program to open .exe files to Wine?
[03:50] <bimberi> !flash9
[03:50] <ubotu> flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[03:50] <Pelo> xzk,  i can'T remember otherwise I would have given you the link  , hence my offer to dcc
[03:50] <bimberi> !defaultapp | exeakiel
[03:50] <ubotu> exeakiel: To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties -> Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror -> Settings -> Configure and then hit "File Associations"
[03:51] <judgen> xzk: its just one file in a tar.gz archive just unpack it and put it in your ~/.mozilla/plugins
[03:51] <xzk> Pelo: can you e-mail it to me
[03:51] <Trevinho> Boelcke, when you can read... Pratically I've to parse some debian "control files"... Splitting it for each "Package" section... So I should take all the text between each "Package:" and an empty line
[03:51] <spuri0s> Boelcke: sure! you've got a link? it might help to try the burning once more as well
[03:51] <Boelcke> spuri0s, two, you might search through www.ubuntuforums.org
[03:51] <Trevinho> any idea?
[03:51] <Pelo> xzk,   e-mail pls
[03:51] <xzk> Pelo: adam.usher@gmail.com
[03:52] <Trevinho> expr "$(cat ./file)" : ".*\(^Package: .*[^(^$)] \+\).*" for example doesn't work
[03:52] <Boelcke> spurio, http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/download.html
[03:52] <Olivia> Hey guys. I have a quick question.
[03:52] <exeakiel> Okay, now I need help with STEAM.
[03:52] <Pelo> xzk,  on it's way
[03:52] <citek> Exeakiel MSG Me.
[03:52] <spuri0s> Boelcke: i'll check the forums as well, thanks
[03:52] <Olivia> I just reinstalled Ubuntu
[03:52] <Boelcke> spurio, I only say that because it's a much simpler liveCD, which might be an easier start.  Good luck!
[03:52] <Mixx`> what's the best way to backup a 40 GB unbuntu partition to a windows share from a USB key with DSL on it?
[03:53] <chris_> xzk: have you tried 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree'?
[03:53] <Boelcke> Trevinho, what are you trying to "select" in each line?
[03:53] <Olivia> I can get to my routers login page, however I can't seem to get outside of that.
[03:53] <xzk> chris_: no, nonfree?
[03:53] <Wiseguy> hey guys ive got a SE w810i cellphone and im trying to sync it with evolution... does anyone know anything about accomplishing this?
[03:53] <citek> How do I get a xscreensaver (animated) running on gnome (Ubuntu) Please help?
[03:53] <bitmvnch> do i need to build a custom kernel for reiser/xfs support?
[03:54] <chris_> yeah, do 'apt-cache search flash | grep -i flash'
[03:54] <Pelo> Wiseguy,  check synaptic for evolution pluggins
[03:54] <Trevinho> Boelck, I've to grab all the text between the "Package:" and the empty line... Then I've to reanalyze these values
[03:54] <chris_> xzk: what repositories do you have enabled?
[03:54] <Trevinho> the problem is that I can't stop the matching when there's a "^$"
[03:55] <xzk> chris_: um, I guess just the default Edgy ones
[03:55] <chris_> oh, that's why then
[03:55] <Skwid_> libxss-dev:
[03:55] <Skwid_>   Depends: libxss1 (=1:1.0.1-4ubuntu1) but 1:1.1-0ubuntu1 is to be installed
[03:55] <desimo> citek: you can change the permissions of gnome-screensaver then xscreensaver should be run instead
[03:55] <Skwid_> any way to force the install ?
[03:55] <chris_> ok hold on
[03:56] <Boelcke> Trevinho, is everthing after Package that you want on one line, or multiple lines?  Where can I look at an example of such a text file?
[03:56] <jrib> Skwid_: what version of ubuntu are you using and what do your /etc/apt/sources.list look like?
[03:56] <Skwid_> Trevinho: hey, you here :)
[03:56] <Skwid_> jrib: edgy
[03:56] <spuri0s> damnsmalllinux sounds like a great idea! :P
[03:56] <Trevinho> multiple lines... an hexample is a standard debian control file
[03:56] <jonxp> How do we go about requesting an updated package in the repository?  For example, the XScreenSaver version is over a year old.
[03:56] <chris_> xzk: you feel comfortable editing a file from the command line?
[03:56] <Trevinho> in my situation is a repository Package file
[03:56] <Boelcke> Trevinho, you've got to use a slash \ before special characters that mess things up.
[03:56] <Trevinho> I can provide a LInk if you want
[03:57] <xzk> sure
[03:57] <Trevinho> I've tried... nothing :(
[03:57] <MSTK> hey all.
[03:57] <xzk> chris_: hang on 1 sec, I may have got it after all
[03:57] <chris_> ok
[03:57] <Skwid_> jrib: http://pastie.caboo.se/26925
[03:57] <jrib> Skwid_: what does apt-cache policy libxss-dev libxss1    return?
[03:57] <MSTK> can anyone help me with music playback?
[03:57] <spuri0s> Boelcke: here goes! you'll see me soon if it doesn't work ;)
[03:58] <Xaphoo> does anyone have any idea why my cdrom drive cannot mount because "no medium found" when I have a CD in it, but is fine when I have a DVD in it?  Has anyone heard of this problem?
[03:58] <Trevinho> Boelcke, look... this is an example
[03:58] <Trevinho> http://download.tuxfamily.org/3v1deb/dists/edgy/suspend2/binary-i386/Packages
[03:58] <MSTK> All of the players I've programmed seem to not have the appropriate codecs or decorders to play any songs
[03:58] <MSTK> including mp3's and other major formats
[03:58] <MSTK> do I have to install them separately?
[03:58] <Trevinho> I've to split the file, so that I can have a file for each package listed
[03:58] <Skwid_> jrib: http://pastie.caboo.se/26927
[03:58] <rajiv_nair> pelo: yeah u better run :p
[03:59] <Boelcke> Trevinho, for example, the command sed -e 's_\$__g' returns the same lines with all the $ removed.
[03:59] <Pelo> rajiv_nair,  breakfast comming back up ???
[03:59] <rajiv_nair> nah:D
[03:59] <xzk> chris_: it's working now, thanks!
[03:59] <jrib> Skwid_: how did that version of libxss1 get installed?
[03:59] <FunnyMan3595> MSTK: Yes.  I'm surprised one of the regulars hasn't dumped you a canned message on it yet...
[03:59] <chris_> great!
[03:59] <xzk> chris_: but now I  may need your help getting QuickTime files to work :(
[03:59] <Skwid_> jrib: hum, it's a dependency for a whole slew of things i think
[04:00] <Madpilot> !mp3 | MSTK

[04:00] <MSTK> if there's a response from ubotu telling me what to do, I'd appreciate it
[04:00] <rajiv_nair> aah
[04:00] <rajiv_nair> there it is
[04:00] <rajiv_nair> :d
[04:00] <jrib> Skwid_: but your version is higher than the version in the repository according to that command
[04:00] <chris_> xzk: I can help you with that
[04:00] <Skwid_> jrib: oh, uh .... maybe it's in one of my svn repos
[04:00] <Trevinho> Boelcke, I don't want replace...
[04:00] <Trevinho> just match
[04:00] <xzk> chris_: awesome
[04:00] <Boelcke> Trevinho, so you want to break this file up into, say, a bunch of files, one for each time you see "Package"...?
[04:01] <jrib> Skwid_: it would have to be one that isn't in your current sources.list (assuming it is 'apt-get update'd)
[04:01] <Trevinho> yes Boelcke
[04:01] <Skwid_> jrib: that's possible, but I don't see which one ..
[04:01] <Boelcke> Trevinho, Hm.  Couple thoughts on how to do this, and I'll suggest one that reeks of my linux scripting newbieness.
[04:02] <Trevinho> or, if you want every time that theres a blank line...
[04:02] <Skwid_> jrib: i did an update to make sure: http://pastie.caboo.se/26930
[04:02] <Boelcke> Trevinho, the one thing we can count on with these files is that a blank line will separate the things.  Or, better yet, that Package will start it.
[04:02] <Skwid_> looking any better &
[04:03] <jrib> Skwid_: looks the same
[04:03] <Trini_Man> Can't listen on HID control channel: Address already in use
[04:03] <Skwid_> jrib: that's weird, i dunno where it came from
[04:03] <Trevinho> yes... Boelcke... a blank line could be considered a separator..
[04:03] <Skwid_> jrib: how can I revert ?
[04:03] <Trini_Man> how do i kill a hidd server ?
[04:03] <Trini_Man> Can't listen on HID control channel: Address already in use
[04:03] <Tmob> i upgraded from dapper to edgy and my x server isn't starting up.. can someone help with this please?
[04:04] <Boelcke> Trevinho, so make a script that grabs a line (I usually use sed for this) and writes it out to the new text file. With a loop, keep doing that, appending the text, UNLESS the new line contains "Package"
[04:04] <rajiv_nair> Tmob: u reinstalled ??
[04:04] <Boelcke> Trevinho, if it does contain "Package" we'd close that file, and start another one.
[04:04] <Tmob> rajiv_nair, no.. dist-upgraded
[04:04] <Boelcke> Trevinho, this sound like what you're thinking?
[04:04] <jrib> Skwid_: you can 'sudo apt-get install libxss1=1:1.0.1-4ubuntu1' but now knowing where the new version came from I don't really know if that will break other things for you.  I think apt-get would warn you though
[04:04] <rajiv_nair> rajiv_nair: bad...hrd many ppl have this problem
[04:04] <rajiv_nair> oops
[04:05] <rajiv_nair> me tlkin to me:D:D
[04:05] <Skwid_> jrib: ok thank you
[04:05] <Trevinho> I was thinking on how could I implement that...
[04:05] <rajiv_nair> tmob: reinstall was safer
[04:05] <Trevinho> boelcke, do you have some lines on head :)
[04:06] <Boelcke> Trevinho, you're looking for some thoughts on a few of the specific command line tools you might use in this script?
[04:06] <starz> 
[04:06] <Trevinho> yes.....
[04:06] <Boelcke> Trevinho, to grab each line from your big text file, I like sed.  Run through a loop, and use something from http://sed.sourceforge.net/sed1line.txt
[04:06] <starz> that is s
[04:07] <starz> how can i fix my keyboard type !_!
[04:07] <starz> [using edgy] 
[04:07] <Trevinho> mh, thanks Boelcke I'll give a look!
[04:07] <Boelcke> Trevinho, I like sed '52q;d' which would print/return line 52.  I set that number as a variable, which I run through in my loop, thus grabbing each line.
[04:07] <Skwid_> jrib: awesome, works perfectly well now :)
[04:08] <jrib> Skwid_: great
[04:08] <econobeing> "Mailcap file /etc/mailcap, line 59: incomplete entry ignored." what does that mean?
[04:08] <Skwid_> jrib: thank you very much
[04:09] <Trevinho> mh, ok...
[04:09] <Trevinho> thanks
[04:09] <Boelcke> Trevinho, then the other cool thing you need is a command to check each line to see if it starts with Package.
[04:09] <xzk> how do I view QuickTime files
[04:10] <Boelcke> Trevinho, so to do an if VARIABLE="Package" you want to have a regular expression.  Um.  Package.* might work.
[04:10] <Trevinho> yes, it should
[04:10] <jrib> ubotu: tell xzk about quicktime
[04:10] <Trevinho> r better Package:.\+
[04:11] <chris_> xzk: download the nonfree codecs: 'wget -c http://www.debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/w/w32codecs/w32codecs_20061022-0.0_i386.deb
[04:11] <chris_> sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20061022-0.0_i386.deb'
[04:12] <chris_> xzk: the above command will download the codec package via wget and install it via dpkg
[04:13] <xzk> w/ terminal, right?
[04:13] <chris_> yep
[04:13] <jake_> Hello, has anyone had any good or bad experiences with madwifi when using 64bit edgy?
[04:14] <ubun> how do i change my screen resolution? say i want to go from 1024x768 to 1280x1024
[04:14] <xzk> chris_: thanks bro
[04:14] <chris_> xzk: no prob
[04:14] <FunnyMan3595> Okay, from my understanding of how the custom kernel works, I think the failure to create /dev/hdX's is probably what's causing the insmod to fail.  Any idea what might be preventing those from beign created?  I've got the driver for the disk, because I can create/mount them by hand.
[04:14] <jrib> ubotu: system > preferences > screen resolution
[04:14] <jrib> ubun: system > preferences > screen resolution
[04:14] <ubun> thanks
[04:14] <Admiral_Chicago> how can i change the number of workspaces i'm using?
[04:14] <Zober> is there a terminal command which will tell me how much memory ubuntu thinks my video card has?
[04:14] <Boelcke> Sorry, gotta run.  Good luck Trevinho!
[04:14] <chris_> xzk: you might also want to download the mplayer and/or vlc video players
[04:14] <jrib> Admiral_Chicago: right click on the panel applet > preferences
[04:14] <tonyyarusso> Admiral_Chicago: Right-click on the workspace switcher.  Options are in there.
[04:14] <tomkelleher> hey, whats the the most popular WiFi tool ?
[04:15] <chris_> xzk: 'sudo apt-get install mplayer vlc'
[04:15] <Boelcke> Before I go, does anyone know why "more" shows these funny question mark characters (in an html file), while gedit shows them as spaces? 
[04:15] <Trevinho> thanks... I'd need Boelcke
[04:15] <Zober> anyone? Please? is there a terminal command which will tell me how much memory ubuntu thinks my video card has?
[04:15] <Admiral_Chicago> tonyyarusso and jrib thanks
[04:15] <Boelcke> Trevinho, you'd need...?
[04:15] <HeathenDan> how do i change my sudo password?
[04:15] <Trevinho> luck :D
[04:15] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: They must not be literal spaces.  &nbsp;'s, perhaps?
[04:15] <jrib> HeathenDan: change your user's password, they are the same
[04:16] <xzk> whats the difference between mplayer and vlc - I use VLC in WinXP
[04:16] <jrib> xzk: they are different programs
[04:16] <HeathenDan> ok, where do i change my user password? XD
[04:16] <xzk> jrib well I know that much
[04:16] <Zober> Heathen: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy/UserAdministration
[04:16] <Admiral_Chicago> one more question, on KDE I can switch desktops by scrolling over the background, how can I do this on GNOME
[04:16] <chris_> xzk: VLC is lighter-weight than mplayer
[04:16] <HeathenDan> thanks Zober
[04:16] <tonyyarusso> HeathenDan: System > Preferences > Users, or the 'passwd' command.
[04:16] <jrib> xzk: try both of them, that's the best way
[04:16] <Zober> Heathen, the way i did it was through single user mode
[04:16] <xzk> thx
[04:17] <Zober> that is if you dont know or remember any of the passwords on the system
[04:17] <xzk> chris_: this terminal download is taking forever :(
[04:17] <briguyd> how do i get a razer pro mouse to work properly? the scroll and side buttons dont function as they should
[04:17] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, hm, hadn't thought of that.  Sounds like a reasonable answer.  How would I hack them off out of a file I've got?  As in, can I just put &nbsp into a sed command?
[04:17] <chris_> xzk: I use VLC as my main video player, but like the mplayer-plugin for firefox and mozilla
[04:17] <Skwid_> anyone use gnome-main-menu ??
[04:17] <xzk> 10% and 30+mins to go
[04:17] <Zober> go into grub, select any boot selection, press "e" to edit, and add the line ", single" and then boot
[04:17] <jrib> HeathenDan: system > preferences > about me, top right corner
[04:17] <Skwid_> how do i enable it ?
[04:17] <Zober> jrib: could you help me?
[04:18] <citek> How do I get a xscreensaver (animated) running on gnome (Ubuntu) Please help?
[04:18] <Zober> how do i check the ammount of video ram ubuntu recognizes?
[04:18] <HeathenDan> when i change my user password, does it also change the root password?
[04:18] <xzk> chris_: now it's at 40min :(
[04:18] <chris_> citek: which version of Ubuntu do you have?
[04:19] <chris_> xzk: yeah, welcome to fluctuating bandwith, lol
[04:19] <FunnyMan3595> HeathenDan: Yes.  There is no root on Ubuntu.  Your sudo password is your password.
[04:19] <Trevinho> Boelcke.. I' got it..... sed -e '/./{H;$!d;}' -e 'x;/Package/!d;/package-name/!d;' /tmp/Packages
[04:19] <Trevinho> works! :)
[04:19] <jrib> Zober: http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/ was your first question.  *Maybe* lshw for your second one
[04:19] <citek> chris: 6.10
[04:19] <HeathenDan> alrighty, thanks
[04:19] <chris_> citek: OK, I believe they replaced xscrensaver with gnome-screensaver
[04:19] <xzk> chris_: are terminal downloads always this slow.. damn
[04:19] <ubun> in the 'keyboard shortcuts' for gnome what does it mean when it says like 0xcc?
[04:20] <chris_> citek: if you want xscreensaver, you need to remove gnome screensaver
[04:20] <citek> Blah, So its not possible to have a animated background? Chris
[04:20] <chris_> yes it
[04:20] <xzk> chris_: 0 k/s :(
[04:20] <chris_> is
[04:20] <chris_> xzk: one sec
[04:20] <chris_> citek: I'll give you the commands
[04:20] <Boelcke> Trevinho, holy cow, what a jackpot!  I just love that sed one-liner site.  Couldn't me more exactly-what-you-need!  Sweet.
[04:20] <TokenBad> what would this mean:  Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate loadable module in module_path: "libicegradient.so
[04:20] <citek> k
[04:22] <chris_> citek: first remove gnome-screensaver: 'sudo apt-get --purge remove gnome-screensaver'
[04:22] <Phenax> Is there anyway, in rtorrent, I can enter the path for my data, instead of it being where I open rtorrent?
[04:22] <citek> Chris_ can we talk in msg this is to busy for me
[04:22] <Trevinho> thanks boelcke... I didn't know that site! ;)
[04:23] <graham_100> Is it likely for Linux to cause me an UpStream problem while using broadband with a wireless card??
[04:23] <Trevinho> and another line works: sed -n '/^Package: package-name$/,/^$/p' /tmp/Packages
[04:23] <chris_> citek: yeah, you use Gaim?
[04:23] <citek> Chris_ Yes
[04:23] <chris_> screename?
[04:23] <jake_> Is there anyone out there using Madwifi with 64bit 6.10?
[04:23] <citek> Chris_: AIM: ItsCitek MSN: ItsCitek@Hotmail.com
[04:23] <graham_100> jake no but i am using 6.10 with wireless 802.11g
[04:24] <iambob> does ubuntu supports parallel startup of services ?
[04:24] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, I tried hacking that character off with a sed 's_\&nbsp__' command, but I'm not sure that's the right way to say it.
[04:24] <Zober> jrib: Thank you so much man!  First response I've got in like 6 hours.  Thank you =D
[04:24] <factboy818181>  hello, for some reason, something keeps on using up my internet connection - is there anyway to find out which process? (already tried netstat)
[04:24] <chris_> citek: ok, hold on, I'll send you and IM
[04:24] <graham_100> can somebody tell me if Linux could cause an upstrem problem with my broadband connection??
[04:24] <jake_> graham_100: ok, I was just told to try madwifi since I couldn't get ndiswrapper to work
[04:24] <briguyd> how do i get a 9 button razer mouse working properly?
[04:25] <jrib> briguyd: you'd probably have to use evdev.  Is that a logitech?
[04:25] <Skwid_> anyone use gnome-main-menu ??
[04:25] <graham_100> jake are you trying to use a wireless network card??
[04:25] <niko_m19> hello
[04:25] <briguyd> no, razer
[04:25] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: Hmm, let me check something.
[04:25] <jrib> Zober: be careful though, lshw reports the incorrect amount on my card.  It says I have 128, but I only have 64
[04:25] <jake_> graham_100: yes, I'm trying to get a d-link pci card to run, haven't difficulties
[04:26] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, ok, thanks.
[04:26] <levander> I'm looking at a bug that says the driver for my network card has  been "back ported" on 11-30.  Anybody can tell me how to get my hands on this driver?  Here's the bug report, it's the last comment on the bug that says it's been "back ported": https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/68338
[04:26] <jake_> graham_100: I've tried to update ndiswrapper to 1.8 but it still won't work.  THe #hardware channel to use madwifi if they support my card
[04:26] <jrib> briguyd: the idea will probably be similar, there is a logitech guide on the forums, and I know there is a guide for the mx1000 on the wiki as well.  You may want to read those and translate the instructions
[04:26] <graham_100> jake i had a world of problems with my belkin wireless g 802.11 descktop card (i found it was using a chipset that i had the driver for)
[04:27] <niko_m19> if you want a partition that works in linux and windows so you can read and write access to it what should you format it.  if your using winxp pro
[04:27] <jake_> graham_100: hmm, my machine doesn't even recognize it when I do iwconfig
[04:27] <TokenBad> please anyone know what would this mean:  Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate loadable module in module_path: "libicegradient.so
[04:28] <jake_> graham_100: I've already wasted a couple of days on this...
[04:28] <levander> niko_m19: last I checked, linux didn't supporting writing to ntfs partitions, but it's been a long time since i checked
[04:28] <graham_100> jake_ i don't know what to suggest to you then it should at least pick up a chipset with iwconfig
[04:28] <graham_100> jake_ lol i wasted a week and then it took me 4 hours to get it working
[04:28] <levander> TokenBad: look for the file libicegradient.so on packages.ubuntu.com - install the package that contains it
[04:28] <pike_> niko_m19: most people use fat32 in that scenario. like a shared partition for movies that both can access
[04:28] <levander> TokenBad: there's also some apt-file command or something to search for it right on your machine
[04:28] <niko_m19> i know what if i made another partition in windows is fat 32 the best?
[04:29] <TokenBad> levander, that would be apt-cache
[04:29] <snype> !apt-cache
[04:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about apt-cache - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:29] <graham_100> jake_ my pc was recognising mine as a RaLink RT61 and it's a Belkin card
[04:29] <TokenBad> did that...but couldn't find it
[04:29] <jrib> niko_m19: you could use ext3 and the fs-driver for windows.  That will let you use ext3 on windows
[04:29] <pike_> niko_m19: probably the easiest solution. linux can read fat just fine
[04:29] <levander> niko_m19: I think so, but I'd check to see if linux can write to ntfs yet.
[04:29] <pike_> niko_m19: and write
[04:29] <jake_> graham_100: Yeah, well, that's how it goes I guess.  I think i have the correct package for madwifi but it's not coming up as a command.
[04:29] <Red-Sox> Hi, I'm in the 6.06 Live CD, and I was wondering how I could mount a windows partition
[04:29] <levander> TokenBad: no, he wants to search for a file in a package that may not be on his system already
[04:30] <graham_100> jake_ i know that there is a sollution with linux you just have to persist and find the right article or person :)
[04:30] <factboy818181>  hello, for some reason, something keeps on using up my internet connection - is there anyway to find out which process? (tried netstat) (bump)
[04:30] <jake_> graham_100: Yeah, thanks for the pep talk, I'll see what I can break now.
[04:30] <niko_m19> so what's good about ubuntu why should i install it?
[04:30] <niko_m19> instead of just running it off the cd
[04:31] <pike_> Red-Sox: first sudo mkdir /media/hda1   then   sudo mount -o umask=000 /dev/hda1 /media/hda1
[04:31] <levander> TokenBad: libicegradient.so doesn't seem to be in any ubuntu package, maybe you have to install it from a distribution directly from the developers?
[04:31] <graham_100> jake_ ok sorry i can't be of any more help to you but there will be a sollution for your card probs somewhere ;)
[04:31] <levander> niko_m19: it's faster (a lot faster) if you install it off the hard drive
[04:31] <Gentoon> what is the off topic chan?
[04:31] <jrib> Gentoon: #ubuntu-offtopic
[04:31] <niko_m19> its seems pretty fast on the cd at least for surfing the net and chatting
[04:31] <levander> niko_m19: and, you can actually save stuff to the hard drive a lot more easily if you install it to the hard drive
[04:31] <TokenBad> levander, yeah I guess so...nerolinux gives me that when open it
[04:32] <levander> TokenBad: nerolinux is commercial, email the makers of that software
[04:32] <SonicChao> !codecs

[04:32] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: Hmm, looks like more knows the nbsp character, but it might still be one of the other whitespace chars.  Can you get the hexcode for it?
[04:32] <jrib> niko_m19: when you reboot any modifications you made won't be there.  And it will be faster too
[04:32] <niko_m19> i think i'm able to save to my usb external hard drive ok i just need to reformat for fat32 again instead of ntfs
[04:32] <levander> TokenBad: I'd look on their web site too, search it with google for libicegradient
[04:32] <graham_100> I just need to know if there is a solution to an upstream problem i have with my internet can it actualy be down to linux or would it be my isp at fault
[04:32] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, how would I get the hexcode for it...?  (Sorry)
[04:33] <niko_m19> how big of space do i need for it
[04:33] <TokenBad> levander, I did it seems to be part of this:  gtk-engines-icegradient   which I can't seem to find either
[04:33] <levander> graham_100: it's probably configuring linux that is the problem
[04:33] <niko_m19> last time i set 10 gigs for it but it only used 3 gigs but i didn't see any aps that were not on the live cd
[04:33] <j1> Need help with wifi on acer travelmate 800
[04:33] <niko_m19> and i made a 1 gig swap i have 512 megs of ram
[04:33] <j1> centrino mini 2100 wifi card
[04:33] <niko_m19> i don't kow if that is to much
[04:34] <graham_100> levander i tried to run my wireless card on an xp machine too but it does the same thing so i guess i am at a loss! do you know where i could start to look for a sollution??
[04:34] <snype> jl its ipw2100
[04:34] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, thanks for the input so far.  My issue is that I have a number that I'd like to use in some math inside my bash script, but it's choking on that extra character.
[04:34] <levander> TokenBad: google search says gtk-engines-icegradient is a debian package, maybe you can get it backports from the backports project?
[04:34] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: You'll need a hex editor.  I'm afraid I'm still a relative newbie around here, but I know I've seen a good one.
[04:34] <Red-Sox> mount: can't find hda3 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[04:34] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, I'll go do that right now.
[04:34] <tjb891> does ubuntu have a java compiler installed on it by default?
[04:34] <Red-Sox> ^?
[04:34] <TokenBad> levander, maybe
[04:34] <jrib> niko_m19: it depends on how much you install.  Currently, my / is using about 10GB and /home will vary depending on what you do.  But ubuntu starts with 2.5gb I believe.  After that it is entirely dependent on how you want to use it
[04:34] <levander> graham_100: call your ISP and get it set up under Windows first
[04:35] <levander> TokenBad: you could install it from the developers distribution...
[04:35] <starz> anyone know what keyboard type i should use for default usa / 104 key ?
[04:35] <niko_m19> why do you need a partition for /home ?
[04:35] <niko_m19> i just made one for root and one for swap?
[04:35] <levander> Does anyone else think the fonts in edgy are horribly ugly?
[04:35] <levander> The emacs font is shit.
[04:35] <niko_m19> how big should i make my swap if my ram is 512 megs and my computer is a p3 966 mhz
[04:35] <pike_> niko_m19: makes reinstalling and such easier you dont loose you config settings etc
[04:35] <econobeing> "Mailcap file /etc/mailcap, line 59: incomplete entry ignored." what does that mean?
[04:36] <niko_m19> i keep hearing people use the word edgy in hear what is that?
[04:36] <jrib> !edgy
[04:36] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. Upgrading to Edgy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - Downloading: http://www.ubuntu.com/download - Release Notes: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[04:36] <graham_100> levander i did have it running on xp for about 2 months and i was plagued with this problem even though i was using the correct drivers, i had my equipment tested by a friend and they said it was all fine! i got in touch with my isp and they were dumb as hell lol
[04:36] <niko_m19> is that a particualar version of the program?
[04:36] <levander> niko_m19: doing it your way is fine with the partitions, some people prefer separate home partition so that home can be mounted other places if desired, there are other reasons, I forget
[04:36] <FunnyMan3595> So edgy's mainstream now?
[04:36] <levander> niko_m19: I think the rule of thumb is that swap = RAM * 2
[04:36] <jrib> niko_m19: my swap is 1GB and I barely ever use any of it (I have 512mb of ram as well)
[04:36] <levander> FunnyMan3595: yeah, edgy's been released
[04:37] <FunnyMan3595> Good to know.  Still, I think I'll wait a couple days before I upgrade, other things to do in the meantime.
[04:37] <levander> FunnyMan3595: make sure to use update-manager and not apt-get to dist-upgrade, upgrading to edgy is a bitch
[04:37] <graham_100> levander i started having a lot of physical memory dumps on xp so i decided to move to ubuntu, after using it for now for2 months i aint going back to windows
[04:37] <graham_100> lol
[04:37] <FunnyMan3595> levander: Thanks, I'll grab the upgrade link from ubotu and save it for then.
[04:38] <debian_gnu_mc> der rule swap=RAM*2 is obsolete
[04:38] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, hex is A0...
[04:38] <levander> graham_100: getting network cards, especially wifi cards, is notoriously difficult under Linux.  A lot of them aren't supported.  I try check my network cards for support before buying them.
[04:38] <graham_100> levander i had no problem upgrading to 6.10 from 6.06 using apt-get
[04:38] <levander> debian_gnu_mc: what's the new rule?
[04:38] <SonicChao> I have a question about this update
[04:38] <levander> graham_100: you were lucky
[04:38] <thmcmahon> levander: there are no rules!
[04:38] <debian_gnu_mc> levander: well it depends on what you do with your pc
[04:38] <graham_100> levander i guess so
[04:38] <levander> thmcmahon: just make sure you die young
[04:38] <TokenBad> levander, found the deb but got depend problems...oh well
[04:38] <SonicChao> I have winXP and ubuntu, partitioned
[04:39] <pike_> niko_m19: makes reinstalling and such easier you dont loose you config settings etc -h
[04:39] <thmcmahon> levander: hahahah
[04:39] <SonicChao> Can I still update w/no problems?
[04:39] <debian_gnu_mc> levander: for normal desktop and office work no swap might be a good idea
[04:39] <pike_> ach sorry wrong terminal
[04:39] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: What's file report for encoding?
[04:39] <debian_gnu_mc> levander: if you have 1gig of ram or more
[04:39] <graham_100> levander when i run iwconfig should i get any output from my card because it is working well
[04:39] <graham_100> ?
[04:39] <levander> graham_100: dunno, i've never run iwconfig
[04:39] <niko_m19> i thought the newest version was called 6.10 and was called soemthing with a d
[04:39] <j1> any one know how to set up a wifi card?  Ive been trying for a week.
[04:40] <levander> niko_m19: newest version is edgy, very 6.10
[04:40] <levander> niko_m19: last version was dapper, ver. 6.06
[04:40] <SonicChao> !wifi > niko_m19
[04:40] <SonicChao> woops
[04:40] <SonicChao> My apologies :D
[04:40] <SonicChao> !wifi > jl
[04:40] <graham_100> niko_m19 new version is 6.10 edgy eft  older version 6.06 lts dapper drake! :)
[04:40] <niko_m19> i see
[04:40] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, well the text file I've put this in says ISO-8859 text, but the original document says "exported SGML document text"
[04:40] <niko_m19> i think i installed the dapper drake version
[04:41] <graham_100> anyone know when Feisty Fawn is due for release?
[04:41] <levander> niko_m19: make sure you use update-manager if you upgrade to edgy
[04:41] <pike_> niko_m19: im still on dapper myself havent had a reason to upgrade
[04:41] <levander> graham_100: april probably, six months after edgy
[04:41] <niko_m19> well i deleted it now
[04:41] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: Okay, that'll be an NBSP then...  Hmm...
[04:41] <levander> pike_: you won't be able to upgrade to feisty if you don't upgrade to dapper
[04:41] <niko_m19> but when i installed it it said there were like 60 something updates
[04:41] <levander> pike_: could just do a complete reinstall
[04:41] <niko_m19> is the edgy version much better
[04:41] <graham_100> i think the only problem i have with my 6.10 is wine won't work correctly
[04:42] <niko_m19> i guess i could download it and burn a new cd
[04:42] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: it has some bugs dapper does not have,but there also many improvements
[04:42] <niko_m19> oh
[04:42] <levander> niko_m19: it has more recent versions of the software packages, and is based on udev which is supposed to work better with all the various hardware, but it's not a huge deal
[04:42] <levander> niko_m19: newer packages, like Firefox 2.0
[04:42] <niko_m19> i see
[04:42] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: cause the new init system(upstart) edgy boots up much faster
[04:42] <j1> I guess wifi is taboo
[04:42] <sethk> j1, taboo?
[04:43] <sethk> j1, what do you mean by that?
[04:43] <niko_m19> i thought i got 6.10 but i wrote 6.06lts on the cd and i remember that name dapper
[04:43] <levander> Is the emacs font for anyone else horribly ugly on edgy?
[04:43] <pike_> levander: ill wait till i start seeing packages that i want but cant install without headaches. till them im happy
[04:43] <niko_m19> so i probably got the older one
[04:43] <levander> niko_m19: what does uname -r say?
[04:43] <j1> I asked for help and no one is offering, probably because its a lot of work
[04:43] <debian_gnu_mc> levander: you can change the font
[04:43] <niko_m19> but i deleted it right when i installed it anyway
[04:43] <sethk> niko_m19, 99% of the time you won't notice any difference between the two most recent versions.
[04:43] <levander> debian_gnu_mc: how?
[04:43] <sethk> niko_m19, I don't upgrade until something I need stops working, which hasn't happened yet.
[04:43] <bimberi> j1: someone triggered for information to be sent to you in a /msg
[04:43] <levander> debian_gnu_mc: what was the old font's name?
[04:43] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: Okay, give this a try.  Open the file in vi(m).  Type :%s/^kns/ /g  (^k = control+k, it and the ns should form a nonbreaking space, which will probably look wierd).  Then :wq to save and quit.
[04:43] <debian_gnu_mc> levander: dunno what the old font is named
[04:44] <j1> ohh, whats a /msg?
[04:44] <graham_100> #winehq
[04:44] <levander> sethk: but then don't you get a huge headache when you want one little thing to work?
[04:44] <sethk> j1, no, more likely lots of traffic
[04:44] <pike_> j1: yeah best bet first thing is to goto ubuntuforums.org and search for your model card
[04:44] <sethk> levander, no
[04:44] <debian_gnu_mc> levander: i think you change the font with the -fn  option
[04:44] <sethk> levander, at least, not so far
[04:44] <niko_m19> whats a good site for downloading various linux distrobutions
[04:44] <niko_m19> i use to use linuxiso.org
[04:44] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: www.distrowatch.org
[04:44] <niko_m19> but there site is down
[04:44] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: or just google for the distro you want
[04:44] <sethk> niko_m19, there is a site specifically about linux distros
[04:44] <Vuen> question, how can i change what happens when i press the power button on the front of my computer?
[04:44] <sethk> niko_m19, which debian_gnu_mc just gave you, before i noticed.  :)
[04:45] <Vuen> i'd like it to suspend. right now it tries to shutdown, and for some reason fails.
[04:45] <borg> does ubuntu have a video editing or video recording vm4linux interface that records in DivX and MP3 video?
[04:45] <sethk> Vuen, usually in the BIOS setup
[04:45] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, sed is able to find and replace characters per the hexcode.  So who cares what the silly character is, I've killed it with a sed 's_\xA0__'
[04:45] <debian_gnu_mc> omfg its 4:45 am here
[04:45] <isede> how can i reveal password in the application pass  field? it's displaying stars
[04:45] <Vuen> *sigh* no, argh
[04:45] <niko_m19> does anyone know a linux distribution i can run from windows on a windows parition?
[04:45] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: Excellent!  Smart man.
[04:45] <Vuen> someone said exactly the same thing in #kubuntu
[04:45] <debian_gnu_mc> should i go sleep or to school i cant decide o_O
[04:45] <levander> isede: i think you'd need to modify the source code of the application
[04:45] <Red-Sox> Allow me to rephrase...how do I mount a windows partition in the Live CD
[04:45] <Vuen> the operating system obviously gets the message when i press power, it does the shutdown scripts
[04:45] <Vuen> i'd like it to suspend instead
[04:46] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: im not sure if i understand what you want to do
[04:46] <FunnyMan3595> debian_gnu_mc: Depends.  Will you sleep through your classes?
[04:46] <tom_kelleher> is there a pack I can download that will give me all the plugins I need, such as Flash, Quicktime, DivX etc.
[04:46] <Boelcke> FunnyMan3595, sometimes you need someone else to suggest another track to go down.  One of your steps to figure it out turned out to be the solution.  Love it.  Thanks for the help!
[04:46] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: but maybe vmware is the right thing for you
[04:46] <levander> Red-Sox: "sudo mount -t <fs-type> /mnt/temp"
[04:46] <debian_gnu_mc> FunnyMan3595: got 3 tests today,so,nope
[04:46] <levander> Red-Sox: make sure /mnt/temp exists before doing that command
[04:46] <spx2> (05:44:28 AM) spx2: how do i load a script in vim ?
[04:46] <Red-Sox> levander: it does not
[04:46] <spx2> (05:44:32 AM) spx2: i mean like c.vim
[04:46] <spx2> (05:44:41 AM) spx2: i installed with apt-get instlall vim-scripts
[04:46] <spx2> (05:44:47 AM) spx2: i think it got me allot of scripts
[04:46] <spx2> (05:44:51 AM) spx2: now i need to run c.vim
[04:46] <spx2> (05:44:56 AM) spx2: but i don't know how
[04:46] <niko_m19> run linux from  a windows partition
[04:46] <malek_> does anybody know how to query a modem in Edgy?
[04:46] <FunnyMan3595> Boelcke: Glad I could help.
[04:46] <levander> spx2: use pastebin for lots of copying and pasting
[04:47] <TokenBad> niko_m19, I think you need something like vmware
[04:47] <niko_m19> in other words run linux without having to make linux partitons and stuf
[04:47] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: why do you want to do that?
[04:47] <malek_> I don't have access to a phone line but need to test a modem
[04:47] <FunnyMan3595> debian_gnu_mc: ><  I have the utmost pity for you now.
[04:47] <Vuen> in windows there's an option in power management that lets me choose what happens when i press the power button. shutdown, suspend, hibernate... is there such an option in linux?
[04:47] <spx2> levander: sorry i just didn't wanted to write it again,it was ment to be written here...
[04:47] <lmosher> I totally forgot, what's the command to burn a *.iso file to dvd?
[04:47] <levander> lmosher: cdrecord
[04:47] <debian_gnu_mc> Vuen: you can maybe change that in your bios
[04:47] <spx2> lmosher: use k3b
[04:47] <sethk> malek_, you can run minicom and do modem commands such as   at z
[04:47] <marginoferror> Has anyone tried the package crossfire-client-gtk2?
[04:47] <Boelcke> niko_m19, yes, you can run damnsmalllinux within windows.  It runs goddawful slow, though.
[04:47] <marginoferror> There seems to be a bizarre problem where each character typed in the command window is doubled
[04:48] <marginoferror> LLiikkee  tthhiiss..
[04:48] <spx2> marginoferror: what is that ?
[04:48] <spx2> Boelcke: or any other distro under vmware
[04:48] <levander> marginoferror: start a new command window, see what happens?
[04:48] <Red-Sox> Okay, I got it mounted, thanks to sudo mkdir /media/sda3 & sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda3 /media/sda3, but now I don't have permissions
[04:48] <Red-Sox> grr
[04:48] <marginoferror> Crossfire is a multiplayer hack-and-slash RPG and that package is the new GTK2 client
[04:48] <Vuen> *sigh*
[04:48] <spx2> levander: can i get some answers please ?
[04:48] <borg> does ubuntu have a video editing or video recording vm4linux interface that records in DivX video and MP3 audio, i'll need that to upload to YouTube
[04:48] <FunnyMan3595> spx2: It's a game.  Sorta like multiplayer nethack.
[04:49] <FunnyMan3595> spx2: But with graphics.
[04:49] <pike_> niko_m19: install vmware if you are wanting to play around with different distros while in xp or just use virtualpc
[04:49] <sethk> borg, any linux package can run in ubuntu
[04:49] <marginoferror> levander, I don't understand what you mean - so it's clear, the command window I'm talking about is built into the game GUI, you can't start a separate one per se
[04:49] <levander> spx2: i have no idea, check #vim
[04:49] <spx2> FunnyMan3595 , marginoferror whats this hack and slash genre ?
[04:49] <borg> sethk i'm talking about the repositories
[04:49] <Vuen> *sigh* i can't tell my bios to tell linux to hibernate
[04:49] <spx2> levander: i'm banned there,i was beeing silly and i got banned
[04:49] <marginoferror> spx2, It's a role-playing game without much roleplaying
[04:49] <levander> marginoferror: i'd try restarting the game them, i thought you meant an xterm
[04:49] <marginoferror> You kill stuff and level up and loot cities
[04:49] <levander> spx2: /msg the admin, beg to be let back in
[04:49] <tom__> hey guys anyone know how to ignore joins leaves in irssi
[04:49] <marginoferror> levander: I tried, but according to the people in #crossfire it is a persistant problem that only happens on Ubuntu's build
[04:50] <niko_m19> i will check out virtual pc on google i have heard of that before but i don't know what that is
[04:50] <Boelcke> ...and to all a very merry good night...
[04:50] <spx2> levander: did that , didn't work,can you talk to anyone there please ?
[04:50] <Per0> hello people
[04:50] <tonyyarusso> tom__: /ignore #channel joins parts quits
[04:50] <spx2> levander: i really need to make it work
[04:50] <levander> marginoferror: well then, you have to wait until they fix it, or recompile it yourself, maybe contact the backports project for a new build
[04:50] <spx2> how do i load a plugin for example c.vim into vim ?
[04:50] <Per0> I open Root terminal and i type wget ( web )
[04:50] <pike_> niko_m19: search for a torrent for vmware workstation but not of course if that isnt leagal to do in your country

[04:51] <Per0> why that ?
[04:51] <borg> sethk ok i'm looking for a program that can do that
[04:51] <pike_> niko_m19: virtualpc while ok kindof blows compared to vmware
[04:51] <tonyyarusso> Per0: What did you tell it to download?
[04:51] <debian_gnu_mc> pike_: please tell things like that in query
[04:51] <levander> Per0: try http://localhost:8080/ ?
[04:51] <spx2> pike_: i don't think giving advice with warez is a good thing..
[04:51] <sethk> Per0, you need a host name before the :8080
[04:51] <marginoferror> levander: Okay, I was just trying to see if anyone else experienced the problem so we could compare packages, versions, etc
[04:51] <debian_gnu_mc> pike_: np
[04:51] <spx2> Per0: 8080 is just a port,you need a hostname too
[04:51] <sethk> borg, I thought you asked about a video4linux program
[04:51] <spx2> how do i load a plugin for example c.vim into vim ?
[04:51] <borg> sethk well yeah
[04:52] <Per0> Connecting to localhost|127.0.0.1|:8080... failed: Connection refused.
[04:52] <borg> i'll be recording from my tv card
[04:52] <Per0> how to fix that ?
[04:52] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: you can download vmware player,its free
[04:52] <sethk> Per0, then there is no server running listening on port 8080
[04:52] <sethk> Per0, is apache running?
[04:52] <debian_gnu_mc> niko_m19: but than you'll have to google for vmware images of the operating systems you're planning to run
[04:52] <Per0> ubuntu
[04:53] <Per0> i run
[04:53] <levander> isn't vmware server free?  i thought it was just vmware workstation that cost money
[04:53] <Per0> that version on linux
[04:53] <Per0> people i can't noone website to wget
[04:53] <Per0> why ?
[04:53] <sethk> borg, if you search, in synaptic, for tv, you'll find several programs that may do what you want
[04:53] <Per0> how to fix that ?
[04:53] <debian_gnu_mc> levander: ah,i think you're right
[04:53] <leekraft> I'm having trouble configuring a Dell 1702FP lcd
[04:53] <sethk> Per0, you haven't told it the name of a web site.  how do you think it knows which server you want to contact?
[04:53] <sethk> Per0, it can't read your mind.
[04:53] <spx2> how do i load a plugin for example c.vim into vim ?
[04:54] <levander> leekraft: "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"?
[04:54] <levander> spx2: you've begged the #vim admin to let you back in yet?
[04:54] <Per0> sethk: no one website
[04:54] <Per0> cant i wget
[04:54] <levander> Per0: we have no idea what you are asking
[04:54] <Per0> PEOPLE !
[04:55] <Per0> LOOK
[04:55] <sethk> Per0, ok, show us a real wget, not one without a web site name in it, and we can possibly tell you what you are doing wrong
[04:55] <spx2> levander: ofcourse,several times,nothing worked..

[04:56] <debian_gnu_mc> Zober: nope
[04:56] <sethk> Zober, solaris is a different operating system
[04:56] <sethk> Zober, there is a version of solaris that runs on x86 hardware
[04:56] <spx2> levander: i did all i could ,i can't do it man they wont let me back in help me
[04:56] <leekraft> yeah I've tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -- I think I've set the vsync hsync right,  and I'm using the sis driver for my[SiS]  661/741/760/761 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter
[04:56] <debian_gnu_mc> solaris is great operating system
[04:56] <spx2> levander: man,i'm desperate please do something
[04:57] <levander> spx2: i don't use vim, i have no idea, can't help
[04:57] <leekraft> now I see small artifacts whenever I move anything on the screen
[04:57] <spx2> IS ANYONE HERE IN #VIM ?
[04:57] <debian_gnu_mc> Zober: you probably dont wont to use it except you're a bit paranoid ;)
[04:57] <sethk> spx2, I know a lot about vim, but I've never even heard of c.vim
[04:57] <Vaske_Car> Pelo, can you also check what I need for these please http://www.joetucker.net/start.html
[04:57] <spx2> sethk: how do i load a vim script ?
[04:57] <sethk> spx2, I find a web site for it.  have you read the site?
[04:58] <debian_gnu_mc> spx2: please dont ask the same question many times,if someone would know it they would answer you
[04:58] <Pelo> Vaske_Car,   flash9
[04:58] <sethk> spx2, run gvim (the gui enabled version of vim) and there is a menu iten for running a script
[04:58] <Vaske_Car> how, where?
[04:58] <Red-Sox> I have a CD of 6.06, would it take longer to install/upgrade, or should I just go ahead and download the 6.10 .iso?
[04:58] <spx2> debian_gnu_mc: it seems my persistance has payed off
[04:58] <sethk> spx2, is it just syntax highlighting for the C language in vim?  if so, there is no need to use a plugin at all.
[04:59] <spx2> sethk: thank you very much :)
[04:59] <Tmob> how to check which arch packages your apt is getting stuff from? like amd64, etc..
[04:59] <sethk> spx2, not sure I helped, really, but n.p.
[04:59] <spx2> sethk: i would like to use vim as a C/C++ actually more C++ ide ...
[04:59] <spx2> sethk: i'm trying to configure it so that it does what a usual ide would do
[04:59] <spx2> sethk: wonder if it got any debugging features
[04:59] <sethk> spx2, I compile from within gvim, and it will give me two windows and show me the place in the code where an error message occurs.
[05:00] <debian_gnu_mc> spx2:  :)
[05:00] <levander> spx2: they just unbanned you in spx2 - they are warning me you will be quickly banned if you act like a moron again
[05:00] <sethk> spx2, it is possible to run gdb from within vim, but I usually use emacs for that, because I'm used to doing it that way
[05:00] <pike_> Zober: might check out nexenta dont know if its what youre looking for or not. my friend loves it. i never really saw the appeal
[05:00] <Vaske_Car> Pelo, I get this error when try to install mozilla_Mplayer http://pastebin.ca/275007
[05:00] <sethk> spx2, go try in vim, and be patient with people helping you for free.  :)
[05:00] <spx2> levander: thank you bro you are my angel :)
[05:01] <Pelo> Vaske_Car,  are you installing using synaptic ?
[05:01] <sethk> spx2, I just joined #vim, and I'm watching you  :)
[05:01] <Vaske_Car> Pelo, yes
[05:01] <spx2> ok sethk
[05:01] <Pelo> Vaske_Car,  have you enable the extra repos ?
[05:01] <ongeboren> i have no popcorn, so i'll not join the watching
[05:01] <Vaske_Car> Pelo, yes
[05:02] <Pelo> Vaske_Car,  try installing from the cd
[05:02] <Pelo> just put the ubuntu cd in while synaptic is opened
[05:03] <leekraft> anybody have advice for configuring a dell 1702FP display / sis mirage1 graphics?
[05:03] <FunnyMan3595> What's the fastest way to figure out what changes I made to a large set of files?  I can untar the originals in a different directory easily.
[05:03] <spx2> leekraft have you tried ubuntuforums.org ?
[05:04] <FunnyMan3595> Speaking of kernel source here, so multiple subdirectories, of varying depths.
[05:04] <leekraft> spx2, thanks I'm new to ubuntu
[05:04] <pike_> FunnyMan3595: diff maybe
[05:04] <FunnyMan3595> pike_: Will diff operate on a directory?
[05:04] <turner> hello
[05:04] <turner> I am having problems with my screen resulution
[05:05] <jrib> FunnyMan3595: diff -Nurp    you only need the -r, but you'll like the rest
[05:05] <pike_> FunnyMan3595: yeah has a recursive flag
[05:05] <turner> It seems stuck at 800x600, but I know this monitor can handle 1600x1200
[05:05] <turner> no options past 800x600.

[05:06] <Pelo> turner,  you need to edit xorg.conf  manualy to add the rez you need   sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:06] <turner> thanks
[05:06] <DanglyBits> can someone suggest a content mamagement system (plone, drupal etc..)  that works well with ubuntu edgy desktop?
[05:06] <jrib> !fixres | turner
[05:06] <ubotu> turner: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[05:06] <TokenBad> if someone wants to run ubuntu server but still use x.org is there a way
[05:06] <tonyyarusso> TokenBad: Sure, just install X on top of the server install
[05:07] <drminime> I'm trying to install xubuntu, and getting a "Buffer I/O error on hd1" on several sectors.  any quick way to fix this?
[05:07] <FunnyMan3595> $explicative $deity...  I just realized that the one kernel source I want the differences on is also the only one that I *didn't* get a tar for.  That one came via git.  $explicative.
[05:07] <TokenBad> tonyyarusso, ok how would he install X?
[05:07] <drminime> hdc1
[05:07] <tonyyarusso> TokenBad: xserver-xorg is the package name
[05:07] <FunnyMan3595> Ah, well, I should be able to reconstruct the changes, it'll just take a bit longer.
[05:07] <TokenBad> tonyyarusso, thanks
[05:08] <FunnyMan3595> Ah, while I've noticed it, any idea why the automatic time synching isn't working for me?  If I call ntpdate directly with one of the servers listed, it works fine.
[05:09] <pike_> TokenBad: i usually install xinit to launch my session too.
[05:09] <TokenBad> xinit?
[05:09] <sethk> FunnyHat, is ntpd running?
[05:09] <pike_> TokenBad: initializes xwindows
[05:10] <TokenBad> pike_, ok so apt-get install xinit?
[05:10] <zombiepig> i'm new to ubuntu, and i think i just screwed my installation up :P can anyone here help me with xgl and an ati radeon adaptor?
[05:10] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: No, and when I opened up Time/Date *this* time, the autoupdate box had come unchedked.  O.o
[05:10] <pike_> TokenBad: basically you have a .xinitrc file in your home directory and a line like exec fluxbox in the file. then just type xinit in the console.  yeah
[05:10] <spx2> levander: is you nickname in any way related to a group marillion ?
[05:11] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Rechecked it, but ntpd still isn't running, and the time hasn't updated (it's 6 hours off, due to the blasted UTC/Central difference)
[05:11] <haxality> helo
[05:12] <haxality> hello, even
[05:12] <FunnyMan3595> Halo?
[05:12] <sethk> FunnyHat, is ntpd installed?
[05:12] <sethk> sorry FunnyHat
[05:12] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, is ntpd installed?
[05:12] <haxality> how would I change the text that is displayed when I connect to a computer with SSH
[05:12] <haxality> or I guess, whenever I log in from a terminal
[05:12] <viyyer> hi I am trying to configure by bluetooth with ubuntu edgy on my acer laptop
[05:12] <tonyyarusso> haxality: /etc/motd I think
[05:13] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Appears to be.  If I sudo it, it exits without message, so there must be *a* ntpd.
[05:13] <haxality> ah, ty tonyyarusso
[05:13] <viyyer> dmesg tells me that there is bluetooth device but there is output from hcitool dev
[05:13] <pike_> haxality: yeah motd. i have a nice little ascii skull in mine :)
[05:13] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, I'd look at the related configuration files in /etc, to start with
[05:13] <viyyer> I can't seem to find a usable device for it either :(
[05:13] <[_miT_] > whats the diffence between the desktop install and the server install?
[05:13] <auk_> i'm having a horrible time switching gtk themes with firefox; i have firefox-gnome-support installed; any tips?
[05:13] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: ntp.conf?
[05:13] <viyyer> any pointers ??
[05:14] <viyyer> I looked up the wiki . can't seem to find anyone successfully run bluetooth on acer laptops
[05:14] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, I think ntpd.conf, but check out any files in /etc with ntp in the name
[05:14] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, you might try /etc/init.d/ntpd start
[05:15] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Trying...
[05:15] <towel> Does anyone know if I need to use WPA for wireless using TKIP encryption and authenticating with EAP-MSCHAP v2 with wpasupplicant my only choice to do this?

[05:15] <Lam_> are all of the beryl mirrors offline?
[05:16] <[_miT_] > tonyyarusso: but i could run desktop and just install the stuff i want to setup my "server" with correct?
[05:16] <tonyyarusso> [_miT_] : Yes, you could.
[05:16] <[_miT_] > thank you.

[05:18] <lufis> What's supposed to happen in hibernation? Whenever I try it (using Dapper) the screen goes blank but the computer keeps running and won't respond until I restart
[05:18] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, it's easy to remember.  the final argument is optional, and defaults to the same as the first argument.  that is,   ln -s /etc/abc   creates a symbolic link named abc in the current directory to /etc/abc.  clearly that can only be true with the proper ordering of the args
[05:18] <Zambezi> Anyone with NEC AD-7173?
[05:18] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Hmm, thanks.  That might help.
[05:19] <Zambezi> Anyone with NEC AD-7173 and know if it's found in Ubuntu directly? I'm going to buy a new DVD DL-burner and it should work in Linux without problem.
[05:19] <zombiepig> anyone able to help me with glx & ati?
[05:20] <Yggdrasil> how can i tell what my serial port is ? dev/?
[05:20] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, just a bit of a trick, but it makes it easy to remember.  the file you are linking to obviously has to appear
[05:20] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: But the other can be implied by the final name of the target.  Right.
[05:21] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, right.  you need a trick here because the order is backwards, compared to all other commands.
[05:21] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, of course, if you can remember the trick, you can also probably remember that the order is backwards ... :)
[05:21] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Yeah.  And compared to the output of ls -l even.
[05:22] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: I think I keep remembering the right order, then thinking "But it's backwards, so..."
[05:22] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Hopefully that will stick.  Thanks.
[05:22] <viyyer> how do I find what is the bluetooth device I have
[05:22] <viyyer> ??
[05:23] <niko_m> hey i installed ubuntu after i ran it from the live cd
[05:23] <Color_Tu> 
[05:23] <Color_Tu> 
[05:23] <viyyer> ow would it show up on lspci ??
[05:23] <viyyer> anyone :)
[05:23] <niko_m> then i deleted the paritions and wiped my mbr
[05:23] <niko_m> windows boots up fine like normal
[05:23] <niko_m> however my lve cd of ubuntu doesn't work anymore why?
[05:24] <Color_Tu> 555
[05:24] <cyzie> Color_Tu, do you type chinese ?
[05:24] <cyzie> viyyer, bluez protocol ?
[05:24] <metrix> niko_m did you change your boot order in your bios by chance?
[05:24] <niko_m> i tried twice to boot from the live cd and it just freezes up while loading
[05:24] <niko_m> nope
[05:25] <niko_m> it starts booting off the cd then it says loading kernel gets to like 40 percent but then just stops
[05:25] <niko_m> i had no problem booting from the live cd before
[05:25] <metrix> I don't know! maybe it's scratched or dirty?  that was my only guess
[05:25] <viyyer> cyzie, bluez protocol ?? how to?
[05:25] <niko_m> i tried booting from knoppix to see if it would work and it worked fine
[05:25] <metrix> It could be the CD
[05:25] <niko_m> i don'tk know maybe it got dirty
[05:26] <niko_m> no biggy i think i like knoppix better
[05:26] <ubun> where's the best place to unpack a .zip file if it's a python program?
[05:26] <niko_m> i could always burn it again
[05:26] <ubun> that's not in any repository
[05:26] <sethk> niko_m, sounds like the cd is bad, or went bad, which does happen
[05:26] <sethk> ubun, makes no difference, really
[05:26] <cyzie> viyyer, by default, just apt-get install bluez but i think ubuntu has it by default
[05:27] <sethk> ubun, I create a directory named python under $HOME, but it's purely a matter of convenience and making it easy to remember
[05:27] <xuser_> Hi, how can i see the battery from cli?
[05:27] <ubun> cool
[05:28] <drminime> hey guys, i'm getting a "buffer i/o error on hdc" when trying to install xubuntu 6.10 - box previously had Win98, hard drive worked fine.  any suggestions besides getting a new hard drive?
[05:28] <Color_Tu> exit
[05:28] <Color_Tu> exit
[05:28] <cyzie> viyyer, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[05:28] <sethk> drminime, try disabling DMA during install
[05:28] <cyzie> xuser_, laptop battery status?
[05:28] <diskus> xuser_: look in /proc
[05:28] <sethk> drminime, sometimes you can do this with the BIOS setup.  there is also a kernel command line argument for it.
[05:28] <ihavenoname>  test
[05:29] <viyyer> cyzie, will read it thanks
[05:30] <xuser_> cyzie: yeah.
[05:30] <ihavenoname>  #sdads
[05:30] <cyzie> xuser_, acpi
[05:30] <drminime> thanks sethk - i'll give it a try
[05:31] <con-man> does anyone here know how to swap my desktops? I have extended desktop using two monitors
[05:31] <xuser_> cyzie: thx.
[05:31] <foomanchew> anyone using a dell c610 ?
[05:31] <con-man> foomanchew: I work for dell, what do you need
[05:31] <foomanchew> trying to figure out suspend and sleep
[05:31] <dos000> howdy
[05:31] <sethk> con-man, you do it in the server layout part of /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:31] <ihavenoname>  well I am using this http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=36410
[05:31] <foomanchew> con-man, well not sure if suspend working
[05:31] <ihavenoname>  right now
[05:31] <sethk> con-man, look for "left-of" or "right-of", and reverse it.
[05:31] <ragawu> hi. I've borked a change of graphics card. agp slot poss faulty, no onboard video, ubuntu freezes after grub. whats the quickest/easiest way to get the console working and retrieve my emails? Ta
[05:31] <ihavenoname>  and it works kewl
[05:31] <con-man> sethk: what do I edit
[05:32] <sethk> con-man, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:32] <con-man> foomanchew: what happens(or isnt happening?)
[05:32] <con-man> sethk: i know. what part
[05:32] <dos000> anyone has quick links to switching between gcc/binutils versions using update-alternatives gcc-4.0.3 is creating a headache in some of the src i am building
[05:32] <ihavenoname>  want to modify your own IRC client and know abit AutoIt then try this http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=36410 kewl XD
[05:32] <sethk> con-man, search for the string "left-of" or "right-of"  it will only occur in one place, and that's where you change it.
[05:32] <kel> Are the 1.0-9XXX seris nvidia driver avaiable in the ubuntu repository at all?
[05:33] <foomanchew> con-man, the when i close it the screen stays active?
[05:33] <cyzie> kel, use automatix2

[05:34] <cyzie> Amaranth, whatever, i have automatix2 just ine
[05:35] <cyzie> fine

[05:35] <ThePub> good evening
[05:35] <sethk> con-man, ok, then I don't understand your question.
[05:36] <con-man> sethk: the screen things my left monitor is on the right, and my right monitor is on the left
[05:36] <con-man> sethk: *thinks
[05:36] <ThePub> con-man: so you need to switch what part of the desktop is on what monitor?
[05:36] <con-man> ThePub: yeah!
[05:37] <ThePub> con-man: and what xserver are you using?
[05:37] <cyzie> Amaranth, if you are talking automatix breaks systems. then in software worlds, latest software mostly break. that is why we have patch and upgrade. IF you want to be stable , use debian stable then ;) or freebsd
[05:37] <con-man> ThePub: XGL
[05:37] <foomanchew> what is the diff between sleep and hibernate
[05:37] <ubun> is fbcon on by default with ubuntu?
[05:37] <foomanchew> which is more efficient
[05:37] <ThePub> con-man: what's your setup atm?  have a pastebin of it?
[05:37] <con-man> ThePub: : http://pastebin.ca/275036
[05:38] <foomanchew> what is the diff between sleep and hibernate, which is more efficient ? whats the norm?
[05:38] <sethk> con-man, either you have dual monitor setup, or you don't.  you have to make up your mind.
[05:38] <con-man> sethk: i do
[05:38] <FunnyMan3595> Hibernate is basically off, fooman.
[05:38] <ThePub> con-man: ok, try "horizontal,reverse" instead of just "horizontal"
[05:38] <metrix> cyzie what they are saying is that when you try to upgrade to the next ubuntu you will probably have trouble (I ran into that with automatix)  easy ubuntu worked better for me...
[05:38] <con-man> ThePub: k
[05:38] <sethk> con-man, your config file is not what I expect to see with dual monitors.  you can't reverse the order when you haven't separately defined each monitor.
[05:38] <cyzie> metrix, i see . thanks.

[05:39] <foomanchew> FunnyMan3595, so what do most people use for laptops
[05:39] <bimberi> ubun: 'lsmod | grep fbcon'  (enabled here on my Dapper install)
[05:39] <ThePub> sethk: yes, you can with the fglrx driver.  it's a "big desktop" setup specific to the ATI driver.
[05:39] <sethk> ThePub, indeed, but I don't believe you can reverse the order if you use that configuration
[05:39] <FunnyMan3595> foomanchew: I generally use hibernate, because I can safely put the computer into a bag without worrying if it'll overheat or run out of power before I use it again.
[05:40] <ThePub> sethk: yes, yes you can :)
[05:40] <sethk> ThePub, ok, I'll put it differently; you can't reverse the order using the normal X configuration methods.
[05:40] <Amaranth> cyzie: Automatix breaks machines in ways we (#ubuntu) will not support.
[05:40] <ubun> bimberi:  says its enabled but when i try to run an app from the console it says 'open /dev/sequencer no such file or directory'
[05:40] <ThePub> sethk: the fglrx driver can "swap" what part of the big desktop is displayed on which monitor.  only works for a dual-screen setup using big desktop.
[05:40] <cyzie> metrix, so easyubuntu is another script like automatix ?
[05:41] <cyzie> Amaranth, are you working for canonical ? ;)
[05:41] <ThePub> sethk: and this is why I said, his question is specific to his setup.  it's an ATI-specific feature that only works with big desktops.
[05:41] <sethk> ThePub, tell con-man, not me.  my dual monitors work the way I want them to.
[05:41] <ubun> who needs automatix, just follow the instructions in the ubuntu docs on 'restricted formats' works perfectly and easily
[05:41] <sethk> ThePub, ok, I see that.  however, you don't have to use it that way.  you can use the conventional multiple monitor setup with that hardware.
[05:41] <metrix> cyzie: yes, I doubt it's supported here either, but atleast it uses package management from what I could see
[05:41] <bimberi> ubun: no idea about that sorry (I don't have a /dev/sequencer here btw)
[05:42] <sethk> ThePub, regardless, tell him how to reverse the order.
[05:42] <cyzie> metrix, thanks. maybe next release i will use easyubuntu
[05:42] <ThePub> sethk: yes, but some people like the convenience of being able to drag windows around their desktop.  :)
[05:42] <FunnyMan3595> Is there any way to force vi to do a write via sudo when you open it in user mode bya ccident?
[05:42] <Amaranth> cyzie: No.
[05:42] <ThePub> sethk: I did.  He quit not too long ago.
[05:42] <sethk> ThePub, I can drag windows around my desktop
[05:42] <Amaranth> cyzie: They do not support it either.
[05:42] <metrix> cyzie n/p
[05:42] <sethk> ThePub, you don't need any special ati specific configuration to drag windows around multiple desktops.
[05:42] <ubun> funnyman maybe alias vi to sudo vi?
[05:42] <Amaranth> cyzie: EasyUbuntu is the same thing, btw. It's not supported, at all.
[05:42] <ThePub> sethk: then if you're using ati and using fglrx you MUST have it setup using the DesktopSetup feature.
[05:43] <Amaranth> cyzie: It's just slightly less likely to explode in interestingly horrible ways.
[05:43] <cyzie> Amaranth, end user normally want easy setup. that is why automatix and easyubuntu are here
[05:43] <ThePub> sethk: if you do not, then you get a clone display.  period.
[05:43] <Amaranth> cyzie: I know, I was an EasyUbuntu developer
[05:43] <cyzie> Amaranth, so i assume your box doesnt have automatix nor easyubuntu ?
[05:43] <sethk> ThePub, I've set up multiple monitor ATI.  Possibly not with that exact driver, but who cares which driver is used as long as it works?
[05:43] <FunnyMan3595> ubun: I'm actually considering aliasing vi to a script that checks for writability and prompts to sudo.
[05:43] <Amaranth> cyzie: But the main things, video drivers and codecs, are being handled in feisty. And no, I don't have either one on my machine
[05:44] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, bad idea, because if the file is read only, it makes no difference who the owner is.
[05:44] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, and read only files are quite common.  so assuming that a file is read only because you don't own it is not a great idea.
[05:44] <Amaranth> sethk: But it's closer to useful
=== bitmvnch is now known as bitmvnch|jaws
[05:44] <cyzie> Amaranth, so why do you quit from easyubuntu ?
[05:44] <sethk> Amaranth, I'm not objecting, just noting options.
[05:45] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Hmm?  I meant to see if the current user could write to it.
[05:45] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, yes, I know what you meant
[05:45] <ubun> same reason all programmers quit anything, time restrictions :P
[05:45] <ubun> im guessing
[05:45] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, and, I said, the fact that the current user cannot write is in general not an indication that the file is not owned by the current user.
[05:45] <Amaranth> cyzie: I wanted it to be an easy way to install/configure things already in the ubuntu repositories, they wanted to do stuff more like automatix.
[05:45] <magic_ninja> is there an apt-get package for the jre
[05:46] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Hmm...  If it is owned by the current user, will w! override the no-write?
[05:46] <Amaranth> magic_ninja: sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre
[05:46] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, yes
[05:46] <magic_ninja> Amaranth: thank you
[05:46] <Amaranth> magic_ninja: It's in multiverse as of ubuntu 6.10 (edgy)
[05:46] <cyzie> mmm... okay. until ubuntu repo has all those easy apt-get install, then easyubuntu or automatix will survive out there
[05:46] <Amaranth> magic_ninja: That's not the browser plugin, you need sun-java5-plugin for that
[05:46] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: So a check for the file not being owned by the user would be the Right Thing, then?
[05:46] <ubun> it's so weird how ubuntu doesnt come with gcc, i've never seen that in linux before, i used to think it wasnt even possible
[05:46] <cyzie> Amaranth, nice chatting with you. lunch. cu
[05:47] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, I can't think of a case where it is the right thing to do, no.
[05:47] <Amaranth> ubun: It does come with gcc
[05:47] <ubun> i mean by default
[05:47] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: The idea is that if I'm opening something with vi instead of view, I mean to edit it, so if I can't force-write it, that's a problem.
[05:47] <Amaranth> ubun: As of Ubuntu 6.10 (edgy) gcc (and everything needed to compile kernel modules) is installed by default.
[05:47] <ubun> when i type 'gcc' it says command not found
[05:47] <sethk> ubun, in the sense you are using it, it doesn't "come with" anything.  One (only _one_) installation type choice doesn't install gcc by default
[05:47] <ubun> cool
[05:47] <sethk> ubun, other installation sets do.
[05:47] <ragawu> how could I stop my graphics card from switching resolution after grub? a particular fb/mode combination?
[05:48] <itfryguy> NUBIE needing help setting up a mock webserver at home using ubuntu and XP... anyone willing to help?
[05:48] <Amaranth> ragawu: No, grub runs at like 640x480
[05:48] <ubun> i understand why though, it makes it that faster to install and take less memory
[05:48] <sethk> ubun, in any event, there is a package "build-essential" that installs the compiler, linker, make, and the stuff you generally need to build (hence the name)
[05:48] <Amaranth> ragawu: I doubt you want to use that on the desktop
[05:48] <mc__> !anyone > itfryguy
[05:48] <ubun> yeah
[05:48] <mc__> !usplash > mc__
[05:49] <sethk> ubun, all the distros have a lighter weight, non-developer option on the install that omits the compiler
[05:49] <DinmO> Hello, gens' instructions state to "If you want a GTK based gens, just type 'make'."
[05:49] <DinmO> Which does not work despite it having a makefile in the directory
[05:49] <sethk> ubun, the only difference is that the "desktop" install, which is most commonly used, doesn't include the compiler in ubuntu.  but that's just an install time choice.
[05:49] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Keep in mind that I'm the only user on this box, so when I open a file owned by someone else, that probably means it's a system file.  I think a prompt to the user to ask if I want to sudo is appropriate.
[05:49] <ragawu> Amaranth: in the middle of a graphics card switch, agp slot is damaged, ubuntu freezes after grub. gentoo loads fine. I need to force a console mode on ubuntu.
[05:49] <DinmO> oh wow I had a space in the directory nevermind lalala
[05:50] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, it's not, because of the reasons I gave.  Many files should be read only.
[05:50] <itfryguy> mc_  - was that a reply to my request?
[05:50] <krept`> eat me
[05:50] <krept`> oops wrong channel!
[05:50] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, what you are suggesting won't hurt anything, but it suggests a mistaken concept about file permissions.
[05:51] <mc__> itfryguy: the first one
[05:51] <[_miT_] > i want to run ubuntu, but i have a skype phone (hardware) that runs windows drivers. what should i do?
[05:51] <MSTK> hey all
[05:51] <MSTK> can anyone recommend me a good media player/organizer for Ubuntu?
[05:51] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, if you want to prompt for sudo when the current user doesn't own the file, then check whether the current user owns the file.  not the read/write permissions.
[05:51] <magic_ninja> MSTK: amarok is good
[05:51] <MSTK> seeing as WinAmp doesn't work, I'm at lost at what to do
[05:51] <MSTK> yeah, I tried Amarok
[05:51] <magic_ninja> MSTK: xmms is great for just mp3
[05:52] <MSTK> but for some reason it ends up crashing my system
[05:52] <mc__> [_miT_] : get another phone
[05:52] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: I'd caught that, actually.
[05:52] <MSTK> every time I load my library
[05:52] <[_miT_] > lol mc__
[05:52] <itfryguy> cool ... how do i set up samba to allow me to log onto the "server" from my XP machine?
[05:52] <Pelo> [_miT_] ,   this is the last tinme I will type your nick,  but look up your hardware in the ubuntu forum
[05:52] <mc__> [_miT_] : or write a driver :)
[05:52] <ubun> how come 'ctrl+j' doesn't bring up the firefox 'downloads' window like it does in windows? i had to disable it showing the darn downloads window by default when i download a file because it 'stayed on top' of the browser and got really anoying
[05:52] <DinmO> Why the hell don't they compile stuff before hand?
[05:52] <mc__> [_miT_] : sorry,i dunno
[05:52] <DinmO> This isn't compiling right
[05:52] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, good.  why use a test that works part of the time, when you have one available that works all of the time.  :)
[05:52] <[_miT_] > Pelo: you've typed my nick before?
[05:52] <ragawu> itfryguy: thats a long answer
[05:52] <mc__> DinmO: did you install build-essential ?
[05:52] <itfryguy> cool
[05:52] <sethk> DinmO, just about everything is available in a binary package.  what are you building?
[05:52] <DinmO> I'm pretty sure I did but I will do it again
[05:52] <Pelo> it's just more annoying them most on this keybaord
[05:52] <DinmO> I'm building Gens
[05:52] <DinmO> sethk
[05:53] <DinmO> It doesn't have a binary available that I know of
[05:53] <DinmO> at least not on the main site
[05:53] <DinmO> I'll check synaptic
[05:53] <MSTK> can anyone help me with why Amarok crashes on me whenever I get it to load my music library?
[05:53] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Maybe the better check would be a 3-case?  1. User owned (writable or not) - normal.  2. Other owned (writable by that user) - ask if user wants to sudo.  3. Other owned (non-writable) - Warn about the file, ask if user wants to sudo anyway.
[05:53] <sethk> DinmO, I'm not sure, I don't use it, but I've found most times there is a binary available.  Building shouldn't be a big problem, but it can be.
[05:53] <ragawu> itfryguy: I know that samba is geared to work almost out off the box, fairly simple config file needs editing in two or three places. good docs on samba site
[05:53] <itfryguy> is there a good step through instruction list somehwere i can follow?  i know next to nothing about command line in linux
[05:54] <rajiv_nair> MSTK: tried rythmbox??
[05:54] <ragawu> hardly any typing needed
[05:54] <ragawu> good practice
[05:54] <mc__> itfryguy: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/
[05:54] <DinmO> sethk, ah I see, I should probably stop complaining so quickly then
[05:54] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, if it's writeable by the user, don't use sudo.  don't use sudo where it isn't necessary.
[05:54] <mc__> itfryguy: there are relly lots of resources out there,you could try google next time :)
[05:55] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: Right.  That'd go under case 1 again.
[05:55] <itfryguy> i did... too much info and most of it not on topic for my problem (that i can tell)
[05:55] <Bakefy> does anyone know where to find the windows programs that are installed with wine?
[05:55] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, sorry, I missed the word "that" in #2
[05:55] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: I must have been unclear.  Case 2 is for u+w files owned by others.
[05:55] <sethk> FunnyMan3595, no, I read too quickly
[05:55] <RaMbLeR> ok i just got this UBUNTU cd roms sent to me .. can anyone actually tell me what it does? is it like an upgrade for microsoft windows or something?
[05:55] <mc__> itfryguy: i think there is not yet a solution for your problem
[05:56] <mc__> RaMbLeR: troll
[05:56] <RaMbLeR> troll/
[05:56] <sethk> RaMbLeR, it keeps your beer from staining your table
[05:56] <itfryguy> i specifically need info about networking XP and ubuntu server
[05:56] <nothlit> it installs ubuntu from a livecd that you boot
[05:56] <RaMbLeR> sethk i figured as much
[05:56] <mc__> itfryguy: first learn the basics :)
[05:56] <itfryguy> everything i find is about ubuntu desktep
[05:56] <itfryguy> desktop even
[05:56] <bimberi> Bakefy: under ~/.wine
[05:57] <sethk> RaMbLeR, but be careful, that crack pipe will still melt the table.
[05:57] <FunnyMan3595> sethk: No worries.  Okay...  Hmm, could probably shell-script that, if I could write decent shell scripts.  But I can't, so it'll be perl.
[05:57] <RaMbLeR> sethk i stopped smoking crackies about 6 months ago so im safe] 
[05:57] <RaMbLeR> :OP
[05:57] <towel> Are there any good guis to manage wpa?  I need to setup wpa w/ tkip
[05:57] <mc__> itfryguy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
[05:58] <mc__> towel: there is wpasupplicant_gui
[05:58] <Bakefy> bimberi: thanks!
[05:58] <towel> oh :o I didn't know it had a gui sweeet
[05:58] <itfryguy> mc_ that looks like a great link.... i installed a LAMP ... let me read some
[05:59] <ubun> what purpose do workspaces serve other than to use up all my memory?
[05:59] <mc__> itfryguy: wiki.ubuntu.com is a great resource
[05:59] <spx2> i can't believe it
[05:59] <spx2> i'm banned again from #vim
[05:59] <mc__> itfryguy: i've got to go to school ,good luck
[05:59] <spx2> wtf ?
[05:59] <spx2> i've just been unbanned
[05:59] <spx2> now im banned again
[05:59] <mc__> spx2: lol
[05:59] <itfryguy> thanks mc__
[05:59] <mc__> spx2: so dont spam channel otherwise ... ^^
[05:59] <mc__> itfryguy: np
[06:00] <writeonlymemory> can someone help me: i just dist-upgraded dapper -> edgy on my laptop and now it won't boot (kernel panic, not syncing; VFS yadda yadda)
[06:00] <ubun> what's a .odp file
[06:00] <writeonlymemory> i've tried reinstalling both linux-image and initrd-tools
[06:00] <aussieahha> hi all - am about to install ubuntu 6.1 on my machine (workshop machine) but wanted to know how to test if my USB ports will be USB 2 or drop back to 1.1 under ubuntu
[06:00] <starz> ubun, multiple workspaces provide a better way to organize your work area
[06:00] <Bakefy> bimberi: is .wine hidden?
[06:01] <starz> but you can choose to just have one... or 32
[06:01] <ubun> starz i see, that's kinda cool actually
[06:01] <ubun> have all my multimedia stuff running in one workspace, programming stuff in another, chat stuff in another?
[06:01] <starz> writeonlymemory, ive found that ive got usb 2 support under ubuntu
[06:01] <starz> ubun, agreed
[06:01] <bjoern_> Hi, I'm running a vanilla install of the current stable Ubuntu server and want to install its kernel's sources. What is the correct package name?
[06:01] <starz> i also run dual monitors so yeah :>
[06:01] <sethk> aussieahha, boot the live cd, do lspci -v.  that will tell you about your usb chip sets.  If you see EHCI, that's usb 2.0 support.
[06:01] <RaMbLeR> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS UBUNTU SHIT?!!!!!!!!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
[06:01] <RaMbLeR> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS UBUNTU SHIT?!!!!!!!!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?

[06:01] <RaMbLeR> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS UBUNTU SHIT?!!!!!!!!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
[06:01] <bimberi> Bakefy: yes,  you need to type ctrl-H in nautilus to see it, and use -a with the ls command (in cli)
[06:01] <RaMbLeR> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS UBUNTU SHIT?!!!!!!!!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
[06:02] <[_miT_] > lol
[06:02] <RaMbLeR> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS UBUNTU SHIT?!!!!!!!!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?

[06:02] <starz> !ops ban RaMbLeR
[06:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ops ban RaMbLeR - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:02] <RaMbLeR> fag
[06:02] <aussieahha> thanks sethk
[06:02] <starz> o.o
[06:02] <sethk> Bakefy, bimberi    -A is better than -a.  (-A is the same as -a but omits the lines for . and ..)
[06:02] <cafuego_> that's a bit odd considering the hostmask
[06:02] <towel> mc: where can i get the wpasupplicant gui?  Am I able to apt get it?
[06:02] <tonyyarusso> starz: For future reference, you can't put a comment on the factoid.
[06:02] <Dr_Fate> where is the 64bit ubuntu forum?
[06:03] <borg> is anybody familiar with the emu10k1 sound blaster driver and volume settings?
[06:03] <gotit> I want to share my internet on 4 different networks , what do I need, i am currently on windows using usb adsl
[06:03] <ThePub> sethk: because the other ATI drivers use different options, so it does matter :)
[06:03] <bimberi> sethk: thanks.  I'll break my bad habits one day ;)
[06:04] <Bakefy> bimberi: Thanks again... you too sethk
[06:04] <starz> i believe the kernel souce package is kernel-source-'uname -r'
[06:04] <shiraz_> hai
[06:05] <Bakefy> Is there a way i can make .exe files shortcuts on the applications pull down menu?
[06:05] <starz> borg, yeah
[06:05] <bimberi> starz: just "linux-source" should do
[06:05] <starz> bimberi, not taken
[06:05] <starz> *note
[06:05] <bimberi> :)
[06:06] <borg> starz, ya know how i can control the bass and treble? i cant seem to controll them
[06:06] <starz> ah
[06:06] <ThePub> con-man: that do it for you?
[06:06] <starz> right click on speaker icon
[06:06] <sethk> ThePub, I didn't say you don't have to be aware of which driver you are using.  I said that they are operationally equivalent.  Although ATI probably adds new bugs to the newer version.  :)
[06:06] <starz> edit > preferences
[06:06] <borg> starz: alright
[06:06] <gotit> I want to share my internet on 4 different networks , what do I need, i am currently on windows using usb adsl
[06:07] <starz> make sure everything from master all the way to synth is clicked
[06:07] <ThePub> sethk: just configured differently.  the open source and closed carry pretty much the same options, but they are all different as far as configuration :(
[06:07] <sethk> gotit, in general you need IP forwarding enabled in the kernel and the default route going out to the 'net
[06:07] <starz> and at the bottom click sigmatel options [should be two of em] 
[06:07] <starz> then youll have lots of fun stuff to play with
[06:07] <borg> starz, everything?
[06:07] <starz> everything.
[06:07] <starz> you can eliminate them later if you like
[06:07] <sethk> ThePub, k, I haven't played with ati in a while, as you've probably  noticed.
[06:08] <starz> make sure all the pcm's are up and all the regular ones are up
[06:08] <gotit> no i mean what kinda hardware i need , soft thing comes after it :)
[06:08] <starz> youll get it but without that i found that my system was not as loud as i was used to for the same volume settings....
[06:09] <borg> starz: why the hell are all these "tracks" here? i mean my card doesnt support any of these
[06:09] <starz> heh probably for software stuff
[06:09] <starz> or because the driver supports a lot of cards
[06:10] <starz> you dont need to click on every track./
[06:10] <drcode> hi all
[06:10] <starz> all the pcm's and a full set of the front / surround / center etc though
[06:10] <starz> hi drcode
[06:11] <viyyer> does ubuntu include the bluez patches for the kernel??
[06:11] <borg> starz: i dont see any sigmatel options
[06:11] <roughtrader> hi all, my AMD X2 is supposed to be running at 2.5 GHz, but edgy is forcing it to 2.0 GHz. Before I tuned off powernow! the cores were at 1.0 GHz each. Any idea how to get them to run at the rate specified in the bios?
[06:11] <starz> eh well click what you do see and run with it
[06:11] <con-man> ThePub: yeah it did, thanks
[06:11] <starz> ^_^
[06:11] <starz> i use the soundblaster 2 personally so i might see a few things you dont.
[06:11] <ubun> what's a .odp file
[06:11] <borg> starz: :(
[06:12] <con-man> im still getting this message

[06:12] <borg> NOTHING AT ALL
[06:12] <viyyer> http://www.bluez.org/patches.html I mean these patches
[06:12] <dos000> anyone can help with update-alternatives ?
[06:12] <drcode> hi all
[06:12] <drcode> I add new user
[06:12] <drcode> can I make it also root
=== encryptz is now known as atoponce
[06:12] <drcode> if I have 1 root user?
[06:12] <gotit> no i mean what kinda hardware i need , soft thing comes after it :)
[06:14] <starz> drcode, dont pm without asking
[06:14] <drcode> k
[06:14] <starz> as to adding a user to sudo yes you can
[06:14] <drcode> I how?
[06:14] <drcode> I have one root user, but I want other one to be also root
[06:14] <starz> # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
[06:14] <starz> %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
[06:15] <starz> therefore add that user to group admin ^_^
[06:15] <drcode> adduser test admin?
[06:15] <starz> this can be done with the gui tools or yes i think that is the correct format for cli
[06:15] <ubun> is it possible to move currently running applications to another workspace in gnome?
[06:15] <starz> ubun, yeah right click on the taskbar on that app
[06:15] <drcode> I have only console
[06:16] <drcode> sorry
[06:16] <sethk> drcode, useradd
[06:16] <ThePub> con-man: great :)  You should check out "aticonfig --help", there are a ton of available options that might interest you.
[06:16] <ubun> starz ah, i tried that on gaim and it didnt work but it seems to in other apps
[06:16] <starz> yes it works in gaim
[06:16] <ubun> maybe because gaim minimizes to the task bar or whatever
[06:16] <starz> on the bottom not on the app itself
[06:17] <drcode> I did "useradd test admin" it still not root
[06:17] <ubun> oh yeah it does work, just didnt seem to because it had 2 windows for gaim (one for the buddylist, one for the IM window) i had to select first, thanks
[06:18] <starz> yeah :P
[06:18] <ubun> speaking of gaim, why does it always have a maximized window?
[06:18] <starz> drcode, what do you mean
[06:18] <ubun> and it wont let me minimize it
[06:18] <starz> it might or might not be able to run things as root
[06:18] <drcode> well
[06:18] <drcode> I add user with ppd
[06:18] <starz> go to system > administration > users and groups
[06:18] <drcode> ppd
[06:18] <drcode> pppd
[06:18] <borg> why is this happening to me
[06:19] <drcode> that need to run pppd, my problem is that it give me premission denied
[06:19] <starz> hmm i dont really know much about that drcode
[06:19] <starz> did you look in the forums at all?
[06:19] <ubuntu-nr-1> good morning
[06:20] <ivx> hey is there a command to tell you the amount of ram in a system, i want to make sure it is all there
[06:20] <borg> good evening
[06:20] <ThePub> drcode: you want to add a sudo user?
[06:20] <drcode> yes
[06:20] <Rageagainstthis> ivs: top
[06:20] <drcode> nm
[06:20] <Pie-rate> is it possible to get a configuration gui for the nvidia drivers?
[06:20] <ThePub> drcode: add the new user to the admin group and logout then back in.
[06:20] <drcode> I solve it
[06:20] <drcode> thanx
[06:20] <ivx> rageagainstthis, thanks didn't think about that
[06:21] <ThePub> dunno why that was such a problem.
[06:21] <ubuntu-nr-1> i testing ubuntu my first time
[06:22] <borg> good evening
[06:23] <ubuntu-nr-1> good morning
[06:23] <borg> no it's evening
[06:23] <Rageagainstthis> is there anyway to "chain" commands in terminal.  example cd home wine f.exe
[06:23] <borg> fine it's morning... 12:23AM
[06:23] <ubuntu-nr-1> !time
[06:23] <ubotu> time: The GNU time program for measuring cpu resource usage. In component main, is standard. Version 1.7-21 (edgy), package size 31 kB, installed size 144 kB
[06:24] <haxality> Rageagainstthis: cd /home/;wine f.exe
[06:24] <noiesmo> Rageagainstthis, you can chain as follows cd /home && wine f.exe
[06:24] <haxality> that too
[06:24] <bimberi> Rageagainstthis: cd /home/blah && wine f.exe
[06:24] <noiesmo> haxality, hehe
[06:24] <Rageagainstthis> thanks noiesmo
[06:24] <krept`> that's not exactly chaining commands though is it?
[06:24] <krept`> like
[06:24] <krept`> ls | grep BOOBS
[06:24] <bimberi> oops, lagging here
[06:24] <krept`> would be chaining commands?
[06:24] <haxality> krept`: piping != chaining
[06:25] <ThePub> krept`: depends on ho wyou define "chain".  What you did was PIPE though.
[06:25] <haxality> chaining generally implies ordered execution, and piping can cause weird problems if you're not actually trying to pipe the output somewhere
[06:25] <ThePub> haxality: bah, my slow typing makes me look bad :(
[06:25] <haxality> hahaha its ok ThePub
[06:25] <haxality> I'm glad more than one person is responding to people tonight :P
[06:25] <bimberi> :)
[06:26] <krept`> is this piping?: mv whatever.txt /home/whatever.txt | rename /home/whatever.txt document.txt
[06:26] <haxality> yes, krept`
[06:26] <krept`> ok
[06:26] <haxality> any time you use the pipe symbol
[06:26] <haxality> which is |
[06:26] <krept`> :)
[06:26] <haxality> wow, random midnight hunger
[06:26] <krept`> i have that same problem
[06:26] <ThePub> chew on a finger
[06:26] <krept`> all day long
[06:27] <MSTK> can anyone recommend me a good media player/organizer for Ubuntu?  as a new user?
[06:27] <haxality> ls fridge | grep delicious-food
[06:27] <MSTK> Winamp doesn't work
[06:27] <MSTK> so I'd like something similar
[06:27] <roughtrader> anyone know what the difference is between the ubuntu compiz and the gandalfn compiz repos are?
[06:27] <MSTK> is there such thing?
[06:27] <haxality> MSTK: XMMS
[06:27] <haxality> MSTK: clone of winamp
[06:27] <ThePub> MSTK: ubuntu comes in Rythmnbox, it's not terrible :)
[06:27] <po0f> MSTK: If you'd like a WinAmp clone, try beep-media-player.
[06:27] <MSTK> I don't want a clone, per se
[06:27] <noiesmo> MSTK, /me uses amarok its a kde app but it runs fine in ubuntu
[06:27] <MSTK> because I want to move away from my Windows past
[06:28] <haxality> winamp is a very un-windows program, though
[06:28] <po0f> MSTK: WinAmp skins are compatible with XMMS/b-m-p, so it'd save you some customization time.  ;)
[06:28] <haxality> it's modular and easy to upgrade
[06:28] <haxality> :P
[06:28] <MSTK> heh
[06:28] <MSTK> true
[06:28] <ThePub> MSTK: Rythmnbox is reminiscent of how iTunes works.
[06:28] <MSTK> i tried rhythmbox
[06:28] <haxality> po0f: your mention of beep has intrigued me.
[06:28] <haxality> po0f: is it still maintained?
[06:28] <MSTK> amarok won't work for me for some reason
[06:28] <MSTK> crashes every time it loads my music library
[06:28] <ThePub> MSTK: What's your library consist of?
[06:29] <po0f> haxality: I don't think 1.x is maintained anymore.
[06:29] <noiesmo> MSTK, is it mp3's
[06:29] <MSTK> um, it was organized by iTunes
[06:29] <po0f> haxality: And 2.x kept crashing on me.
[06:29] <haxality> po0f: it still looks a heckuva lot more modern than XMMS :P
[06:29] <MSTK> it's a whole variety of file formats
[06:29] <nothlit> Winamp 2 clone*
[06:29] <ubun> what does 'always visible workspace' mean
[06:30] <ubun> winamp clone minus the bloat/adware?
[06:30] <po0f> haxality: Yes it does, but I have actually grown fond of Rhythmbox.
[06:30] <MSTK> so...rythmbox?  XMMS?
[06:30] <ubun> fond?? rhythmbox??
[06:30] <haxality> po0f: I'm not a big fan of the whole media library trend
[06:30] <haxality> I'm stuck in the past, apparently
[06:30] <haxality> :P
[06:30] <nothlit> ubun, it means it'll show up on all the desktops, if you use desktops/workspaces
[06:30] <ThePub> MSTK: xmms doesn't fit well into gnome imo :)  rythmnbox on the otherhand is a gnome application and supports all the media plugins :)
[06:30] <MSTK> ah.
[06:30] <MSTK> thanks
[06:30] <paradox34690> Hey, since you guys are on the subject of a media player, could one of you point me to how to change the system sounds??
[06:31] <ubun> i dont like the media library trend either, but i like amarok
[06:31] <po0f> haxality: I used to not be, then I kinda stopped caring; a music player plays music, and Rhythymbox does it for me.  Of course, YMMV.
[06:31] <haxality> ThePub: of course, I mainly mentioned XMMS as a knee-jerk since he mentioned winamp
[06:31] <haxality> po0f: of course. thus the huge number of linux media players :P
[06:31] <MSTK> What about, say, Banshee?
[06:31] <ubun> i like foobar2000 the best, but it's for windows, love it's simple/light interface with tabs for multiple playlists
[06:31] <rozbeh> hi
[06:32] <po0f> MSTK: Is that the C# app?  *eww*
[06:32] <MSTK> yeah, I didn't quite like the UI
[06:32] <ThePub> media libraries are great, especially once you start pushing thousands and thousands of songs/movies.
[06:32] <MSTK> so I should use rhythmbox, then?
[06:33] <ubun> use whatever you like best, yo uwont know till you try them all
[06:33] <po0f> MSTK: If I were you, I would use it for now;  there's a reason it's the default.
[06:33] <haxality> ThePub: I have 9000+ audio files and I still like using playlists and the 'jump' function
[06:33] <MSTK> and it has iPod support, so that's a plus
[06:33] <haxality> :P
[06:33] <ThePub> MSTK: muine isn't terrible either, seems like it has some "issues" though.
[06:34] <haxality> haha not trying to start an argument or anything, I'm just trying to give the flipside of this discussion
[06:34] <con-man> gtk says no package cairo found
[06:34] <con-man> and cairo wont install
[06:34] <haxality> just occured to me I've been doing the point-counterpoint thing to everything you say
[06:34] <jsjc> hello
[06:34] <ThePub> haxality: media libraries are just extended forms of playlist really.  the advantage being it gives you an easy way to store lyrics and such along with your music.
[06:34] <jsjc> I was trying now my new Atheros card under ubuntu but madwifi is not working....
[06:35] <jsjc> how I can delete actual madwifi dirvers and put neones??
[06:35] <ubun> is rhythmbox skinable or at least color changeable
[06:35] <con-man> anyone know how to install cairo?
[06:35] <uMISTA> so can i change my gaim themes?
[06:35] <ThePub> ubun: it's a hig compliant gnome app, it uses the current gnome theme.
[06:35] <ubun> i see
[06:36] <fowlduck> anyone here an artist who wants to donate to an foss project?
[06:37] <uMISTA> trying to install, flash for firefox 2.0 but it will not install, when i use the installer it works then says it not installed any ideas

[06:38] <haxality> ok random question
[06:38] <jsjc> madwifi for ubuntu help?
[06:38] <haxality> if I wanted to write a shell script where I use a password
[06:38] <haxality> could I point it at a password file
[06:38] <haxality> instead of storing my pass in plaintext in a file
[06:38] <haxality> or maybe make it ask for my password
[06:38] <ThePub> haxality: sure..  `cat /path/to/file`
[06:38] <haxality> ah excellent
[06:39] <haxality> thank you
[06:39] <haxality> wow, I keep forgetting how awesome bash is
[06:39] <fowlduck> anyone here an artist who wants to donate to an foss project?  I need a logo for a project
[06:39] <ThePub> bash can totally be made your bitch, the syntax is just a tad heavy imo :)
[06:39] <Rageagainstthis>  lsmod | grep snd_seq &&  timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os & && wine '/home/rage/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Guitar Pro 5/GP5.exe'  this command gives me a "syntax error near unexpected token `&&'".  I can do them separately  lsmod | grep snd_seq &&  timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os & then open a tab and do wine.  What i am trying to accomplish is making a shortcut for this program so i dont have to create two shortcuts.  So is there a command that a
[06:39] <ThePub> CSH ftw
[06:40] <MSTK> sorry for a Media Player question again
[06:40] <MSTK> but is there any one for Ubuntu
[06:40] <crimsun> Rageagainstthis: because you have a stray '&' preceding the second '&&'
[06:40] <srf21c> Hey anyone here have experience troubleshooting Java issues?  I'm trying to run DVArchive (java program for ReplayTVs) and it keeps crashing on launch
[06:40] <MSTK> that has an organization feature
[06:40] <MSTK> like iTunes?
[06:40] <MSTK> where it copies your library to a clean directory
[06:40] <MSTK> sorted by artist, albums, etc. in folders
[06:40] <srf21c> sez "DVarchive encountered an internal error at startup"
[06:40] <ubun> mstk yamipod?
[06:41] <Rageagainstthis> well i will remove that & and see if it exectures the same
[06:41] <po0f> Rageagainstthis: What heppens when you change the && after the timidity command to a ; ?
[06:41] <MSTK> yamipod?
[06:41] <ubun> i use amarok for an itunes replacement
[06:41] <ThePub> MSTK: like I said:  rythmnbox
[06:41] <ubun> but it's kde
[06:41] <haxality> I will say that amarok is awesome as far as itunes-ish programs go
[06:41] <srf21c> Command line spits out this msg DVArchive failed to start user interface -- null

[06:41] <MSTK> ThePub - is there  aplug-in for that?
[06:41] <ThePub> rythmnbox is more like itunes than amarok.. amarok has more features.
[06:41] <haxality> whoa
[06:41] <Rageagainstthis> syntax error near unexpected token `;'
[06:42] <MSTK> too bad Amarok doesn't work for me, for some reason
[06:42] <ubun> yamipod runs in linux and allows you to copy files from your ipod to your harddrive in a nice way
[06:42] <ThePub> Rageagainstthis: use pastebin.
[06:42] <ubun> but if you just need a player then rhythmbox should be enough
[06:42] <ThePub> or rather.. srf21c
[06:42] <tonyyarusso> srf21c: #1, use !pastebin, #2, #java.
[06:42] <MSTK> ThePub - so wait, there's a plug-in for music library organization in rhythmbox?
[06:42] <srf21c> doh!  Sorry about that.
[06:42] <ubun> rhythmbox organizes by default i think
[06:42] <DBO> srf21c, its ok, now you know =)
[06:43] <ThePub> MSTK: plugin?  no, organization is a major part of the interface.
[06:43] <srf21c> So, uh, what is pastebin?
[06:43] <srf21c> is that an IRC command?
[06:43] <ubun> use !pastebin to find out ;0
[06:43] <ThePub> MSTK: rythmnbox is essentially an iTunes workalike.
[06:43] <QwertyM> MSTK, what's wrong with Amarok?
[06:43] <srf21c> !pastebin
[06:43] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:43] <MSTK> I meant, like, a system that copies all of your music library to a special directory, with folders organized by author and album
[06:43] <Rageagainstthis> !pastebin
[06:43] <ubun> amarok works fine for me in kde
[06:44] <ubun> er in gnome
[06:44] <MSTK> Amarok crashes when I try to load my music library.
=== kevin is now known as kwood
[06:44] <ubun> are you sure it's crashing and not just minimizing itself to the task bar or whatever it's called
[06:44] <QwertyM> strange, I use it to load music from my ntfs and it does it all fine :D
[06:44] <ThePub> MSTK: oh, idk if it'll do that.  I've always manually managed my audio directory :)
[06:44] <kwood> could anyone tell me why when i try to install phpmyadmin i get a package not found?
[06:44] <MSTK> oh well.  I guess I could do that
[06:44] <MSTK> ubun: no, it crashes
[06:44] <QwertyM> My arrangement's like Artist > Album > Songs + Art
[06:44] <MSTK> I have to reboot
[06:45] <QwertyM> woah... must be something goin hawireee
[06:45] <Yggdrasil> hello ,  can somone gime a hand , ive got a dell c600 and when i boot us im hanging up on laoding hald daemon and then none of my drives work.. network drives
[06:45] <QwertyM> hay*
[06:45] <Dr_Fate> :-)
[06:45] <con-man> why wont cairo just install
[06:45] <con-man> damnit
[06:45] <Skizzo> Whats the off topic chan
[06:45] <ubun> #ubunto-offtopic
[06:45] <con-man> gtk requires cairo
[06:45] <con-man> cairo wont install
[06:46] <jsjc> qhy qith XGL the scorched3d has non readable fonts?
[06:46] <ubun> rhythmbox isnt so bad, seems to orgnize by artist by default
[06:46] <kwood> will phpmyadmin not install via apt-get? the faq says it can yet i get that it couldnt find the package..
[06:46] <ubun> it's just simple but some people like simple
[06:47] <QwertyM> jsjc, xgl has issues with 3d-accln apps
[06:47] <po0f> kwood: Is the package in question installed?
[06:47] <MSTK> okay.  I guess I'll have to revert to manually managing my library's files
[06:47] <MSTK> not that it'll be too bad
[06:47] <kwood> po0f: no clue... i thought apt-get is what installed it..
[06:47] <QwertyM> i got xmoto and it runs very slow on aiglx
[06:47] <Pie-rate> is there an easy way to install the nvidia beta drivers? i hear they have a nice control panel
[06:48] <po0f> kwood: Try installing the application it complains about separately from phpmyadmin.
[06:48] <poisson> Hi. How can i know if my Graphic Card supports glx?
=== Skizzo is now known as Gentoon
[06:48] <QwertyM> !envy | Pie-rate
[06:48] <ubotu> Pie-rate: envy is a Perl script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[06:48] <kwood> po0f: its not complaining about any other packages... just that it couldnt find package phpmyadmin..
[06:48] <Pie-rate> ubotu is wrong, envy is a python script
[06:49] <po0f> kwood: Do you have universe enabled?
[06:49] <MSTK> hey, does rhythmbox support video?
[06:49] <kwood> po0f: yup, uncommented the lines just a minute ago... although I did attempt to pull up the urls in firefox.. and i got nothing
[06:49] <poisson> anyone? :(
[06:50] <kwood> deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy-updates main restricted
[06:50] <kwood> deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy-updates main restricted
[06:50] <kwood> the space kinda worries me..
[06:50] <po0f> kwood: Did you `apt-get update` after changing sources.list?
[06:50] <kwood> po0f: nope.. should i?
[06:50] <po0f> kwood: Yes.  :)
[06:50] <kwood> alrighty ill try that
[06:50] <kwood> thx
[06:50] <lotusleaf> has anyone here used bootcd before with edgy?
[06:50] <QwertyM> how do I install mouse pointers ?
[06:51] <uMISTA> is there a beryl room around here
[06:51] <lotusleaf> !bootcd
[06:51] <ubotu> bootcd: run your system from cd without need for disks. In component universe, is extra. Version 2.53 (edgy), package size 52 kB, installed size 224 kB
[06:51] <tonyyarusso> uMISTA: #beryl and #ubuntu-xgl
[06:51] <Roots> I'm running the edgy bootcd right now actually (on my laptop)
[06:51] <po0f> MSTK: AFAIK no.  Anything I throw at RhytymBox + VLC gives me no problems.
[06:52] <MSTK> well, that kind of inhibits my iPod syncing =/
[06:52] <Roots> For some reason ubuntu isn't finding my hard drive, and I can't figure out how to mount it (it won't grant me su access). Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get my hard drive to show up?
[06:52] <jsjc> QwertyM, is there anyway to fix the issues between XGL and my 3d applications???
[06:52] <tonyyarusso> !sudo | Roots
[06:52] <po0f> MSTK: Have you tried gtkpod?
[06:52] <ubotu> Roots: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:52] <QwertyM> jsjc, i dont know that :(
[06:52] <belfegorash> what is the difference ?cracker-hacker?
[06:53] <MSTK> gktpod?
[06:53] <Roots> Thanks, I forgot about sudo :)
[06:53] <jsjc> Also I have a question I have a live cd distro called Backtrack that uses madiwifi drivers and my wireless cards works perfect but in Ubuntu the drivesrs that come in the restricted modules they do not work, anyone could help me??
[06:53] <MSTK> i was going for a whole media player-syncer thing
[06:53] <lotusleaf> Roots: by edgy "bootcd" do you mean the edgy cd that boots or one you made yourself with the bootcd package?
[06:53] <QwertyM> how do I install mouse pointers ?
=== brainsik is now known as brainsik_away
[06:53] <jsjc> anyone uses dell laptops with the dell mediadirect button?? It is anyone abel to boot mediadirect with grub?
[06:53] <lotusleaf> Roots: that's why I called !bootcd to be specific
[06:53] <Roots> I downloaded the edgy dvd iso and burnt it to a dvd, then stuck it in
[06:54] <lotusleaf> Roots: that's not what I'm talking about :)
[06:54] <Roots> okay, sorry
[06:54] <lotusleaf> Roots: np :)
[06:54] <Mokshu> hi
[06:54] <MSTK> hi
[06:55] <po0f> MSTK: I don't have an iPod so I can't comment on RhythymBox's iPod support.
[06:55] <MSTK> Rhythmbox's ipod support is great
[06:55] <MSTK> but it doesn't support videos =/
[06:56] <Mokshu> I've got a problem since today. When I login on my Edgy on the session screen, it tries to start Xorg but then goes back to session choice screen
[06:56] <Mokshu> I've tried using recovery mode, and it seems i can do a startx as a root, everything works fine. But when I logon with my usual account, Xorg just crash :(
[07:00] <Pie-rate> YAY most dupes i've ever seen on my reuters: top news list on my google homepage: Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet dies at 91... 6 times
[07:01] <ThePub> is it just me or is the initial gnome desktop far more sane and useful than the initial kde desktop?
[07:02] <MSTK> Guess what, guys?  Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet dies at 91
[07:02] <cybermad> do you know software in linux that similiar like AI Roboform in windows?
[07:03] <cybermad> the software is use for control username, password, etc for website
[07:03] <econobeing> hey, what's this line from /ext/mailcap do? "application/x-emerald-theme ext: emerald"
[07:03] <econobeing> i assume it associates *.emerald files with emerald
[07:05] <po0f> econobeing: Talking about C::B?  I saw your thread on the forums.
[07:05] <econobeing> yeha
[07:05] <econobeing> yeah*
[07:05] <po0f> econobeing: You can ignore it, I did.  :)
[07:05] <ThePub> econobeing: considering the first line of the description of mailcap using man, that makes sense.
[07:06] <Mokshu> no idea?
[07:06] <po0f> Mokshu: pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log.
[07:06] <dabaR> Mokshu: did you do anything to X? do you get an error message?
[07:07] <econobeing> hmmm, well i looked at some other post and somebody just said to delete the line, so i did that, and i don't get an error now
[07:07] <Mokshu> no error message appears when I try to log, just a blinking cursor, then session screen again
[07:07] <po0f> econobeing: I personally would have just commented it if I went that route, but whatever works.  :)
[07:07] <CowEdgy> is there a movie editing program for ubuntu similar to adobe premier?
[07:07] <econobeing> yeah i should open it back up and put it back in with a comment
[07:08] <MSTK> ah.  neither Amarok nor Rhythmbox support video playback
[07:08] <MSTK> any suggestions?
[07:08] <Geoffrey3> ah yes, that wonderful router exploit again.....
[07:08] <CowEdgy> MSTK, try use VLC
=== Geoffrey3 is now known as Geoffrey2
[07:09] <Mokshu> po0f : http://pastebin.wikistuce.info/?392
[07:09] <MSTK> VLC is great, but I was looking for a media organizer type thing
[07:10] <MSTK> such as WinAmp or iTunes
[07:10] <sciboy> Yo
[07:11] <CowEdgy> hmm i dont know if winamp will run under wine
[07:11] <sciboy> What would i have to do to Jahshaka's configure script to slip a -fPIC in here? g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,libopengpulib.so.1 -o libopengpulib.so.1.0.0 gpumathlib.o gpumathlib_textures.o glsl_objects.o   -L/usr/share/qt3/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib ../../AuxiliaryLibraries/glew/libglew.a -lqt-mt -lGLU -lGL -lXmu -lXext -lX11 -lm -lpthread
[07:11] <MSTK> I'm not looking for winamp, I'm looking for something new to fit my new Windows-Free lifestyle :)
[07:11] <po0f> Mokshu: Nothing comes up, and I don't speak French.  (That is French, corect?)
[07:11] <lupine_85> amarok :)
[07:11] <sciboy> I thought CXXFLAGS would've been appended to all g++ commands.
[07:11] <MSTK> doesn't play videos =/
[07:11] <Mokshu> Hmm, yeah buyt should print a pastebin style file
[07:12] <firebird619> Are there any music programs that support transcoding files before transferring them to an MP3 player? Winamp has this capability in Windows, I was wondering if there was something similar for Linux.
[07:12] <po0f> sciboy: What does CXXFLAGS look like now?
[07:12] <auk_> po0f: yes, it's french, but a terminal output will show up that's in english
[07:12] <Orangekid13> go online... there's a bunch of sites that convert for free really fast
[07:13] <sciboy> po0f, CXXFLAGS=-fPIC
[07:13] <Orangekid13> (to firebird(
[07:13] <po0f> auk_: I don't get any output.
[07:13] <Orangekid13> )
[07:13] <MSTK> so, erm...I'm looking for a WinAmp/iTunes like program that supports video playback and iPod syncing...sorry for the burden
[07:13] <MSTK> but does anyone have any suggestions?
[07:14] <po0f> sciboy: Is there a line from a Makefile you could post?
[07:14] <sciboy> po0f, I mean, earlier in the compile it was appending -fPIC as i wanted, but when it got up to this stage it just stopped for some odd reason.
[07:14] <firebird619> Orangekid13: I will check into that, I was hoping for a program to install rather than a Web site, but thanks.
[07:14] <napox> little question, i installed vmware server and i was to run my winxp that on another hard disk. anyone knows how i do that ?
[07:15] <auk_> po0f: make sure you have javascript turned on
[07:15] <po0f> auk_: Ahh.
[07:15] <auk_> :)
[07:16] <sciboy> po0f, Trying to find the offendor, not having much luck.
[07:16] <po0f> Well, Mokshu left.
[07:17] <CowEdgy> what's the program for ubuntu that is similar to nero?
[07:17] <po0f> CowEdgy: I use GnomeBaker, but K3b is a good one as well.
[07:18] <CowEdgy> does it write ISOs?
[07:18] <po0f> CowEdgy: Yes.
[07:18] <dabaR> !burn > CowEdgy
[07:18] <po0f> sciboy: How big's the Makefile?
[07:18] <CowEdgy> thanks
[07:18] <po0f> sciboy: And is there a link you could give me for reference as to what this is about?
[07:18] <sciboy> po0f, It isnt' a single Makefile.
[07:18] <sciboy> po0f, http://www.jahshaka.net
[07:19] <sciboy> Whoops.
[07:19] <sciboy> Make that .org
[07:20] <CryptoMole> hey all
[07:20] <Surghi> Question: What device holds my extern Harddrive, please?   I did a   tail -f /var/log/syslog   when I plugged it in .... this is what I got     http://85.237.25.101/my_syslog.txt
[07:20] <po0f> sciboy: And are you having errors with that library, or are you just sating curiousity?
[07:21] <po0f> Surghi: Try `tail -f /var/log/messages`.
[07:21] <sciboy> po0f, It's not compiling, and i can't add the flag it wants.
[07:21] <uMISTA> how can i change the gurb settings?
[07:22] <Surghi> po0f: does not give me any more info
[07:23] <CowEdgy> hmm ubuntu is the 1st linux OS i've installed without problems
[07:23] <po0f> Surghi: Are there no errors output when you plug it in?
[07:23] <Surghi> no
[07:23] <Surghi> you saw the same as I saw
[07:24] <Surghi> and /var/log/messages seems to show the same as syslog
[07:24] <Surghi> or even nothing new
[07:24] <po0f> sciboy: I don't feel like registering to download it.
[07:24] <sciboy> po0f, I didn't, BugMeNot is nifty that way.
[07:24] <po0f> Surghi: My guess is that it would be /dev/sd*.
[07:25] <Surghi> normally its   /dev/sde  or  sda  sometimes  1  sde1  or sda1
[07:25] <Surghi> but its none of them
[07:25] <Surghi> I try to mount it on MS Windows
[07:25] <QwertyM> anyone knows how to install a mouse pointer pack I got off gnome-look [jaguar] 
[07:25] <Surghi> lets see if the harddrive does not work
[07:25] <po0f> Surghi: Is there another machine you could try this on?
[07:25] <Surghi> yes, windows laptop

[07:28] <gephalt> Hi folks. Not exactly an ubuntu question- but still will ask here anyway. now when i use #!/bin/bash let "a += 1" in a script and use it, bash does not understand. but it works perfectly from command line
[07:28] <gephalt> what gives?
[07:29] <Orangekid13> how does the grub setup work? is ig gui?
[07:29] <Orangekid13> *is it gui?
[07:29] <pegger> i try the write with GnomeBaker but it's write UTF-8 character encoding detected by locale settings. Assuming UTF-8 encoded filenames on source filesystem,
[07:30] <gephalt> anyone?
[07:30] <Orangekid13> i'm a noob and i don't know how to set it up...
[07:31] <Orangekid13> i have 2 hd's and windows is on one, the other hasn't even been formatted (new machine)
[07:31] <Orangekid13> i want ubuntu on the other one and i want grub to work right
[07:32] <somerville32> There is a script to configure grub.
[07:32] <ThePub> Orangekid13: read through the grub man page, it's worth your time and well written.
[07:32] <somerville32> Or do as ThePub recommends <g>
[07:33] <slinky_> Orangekid13: do you have a live cd for ubuntu?
[07:33] <po0f> gephalt: Works for me.
[07:33] <Orangekid13> yes
[07:33] <Orangekid13> what is the grub main page
[07:33] <Orangekid13> im searching and mainly get wikis and forums
[07:33] <po0f> gephalt: That isn't all one line is it?
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:33] <slinky_> Orangekid13: what version of ubuntu do you have 06.6.1 or 6.10
[07:34] <Orangekid13> 6
[07:34] <gephalt> po0f: no. its part of the abs-guide.
[07:34] <Orangekid13> oops
[07:34] <Orangekid13> 6.10
[07:34] <Orangekid13> missed the decimal
[07:34] <Orangekid13> got the enter key
[07:34] <gephalt> damned thing- typed it to the letter and even zoomed in to 400% just to check whether I missed anything

[07:35] <slinky_> Orangekid13: I had some problems with 6.10 but i'm new also, I went back to 6.06.1 Dapper Drake, I find it more stable for a beginner
[07:35] <Orangekid13> well there's some stuff with my mobo i have to be on edgy for
[07:35] <Orangekid13> driver shiz
[07:36] <Orangekid13> i just want to know what i'm getting into with grub before i do it
[07:36] <po0f> gephalt: This is what works for me (; are new lines): #!/bin/bash ; let "a += 1" ; echo $a
[07:36] <Orangekid13> what's the url for the grub page?
[07:36] <mneptok> Orangekid13: GRUB has to be on the drive with Windows.
[07:36] <Orangekid13> k
[07:36] <slinky_> Orangekid13: I had win xp pro on when i installed Dapper from a live cd and installation went flawless for me by doing the following
[07:36] <po0f> sciboy: Compiling as we speak.  :)
[07:36] <mneptok> Orangekid13: (unless you are using SATA)
[07:36] <Orangekid13> no sata
[07:36] <sciboy> po0f, Yeah, it appears to be 64-bit related, so you may not run into anything.
[07:37] <CowEdgy> i'm using SATA
[07:37] <CowEdgy> it has been ok
[07:37] <ThePub> 6.10 is really good about setting up your currently installed operating systems.  a normal ubuntu install should be all you really need to do if you're unwilling to educate yourself.
[07:37] <mneptok> Orangekid13: Windows insists on being installed on the master device on a PATA chain. therefore, whatever bootloader is on the drive with Windows is the one the machine will use. and to dual boot, you need a Linux bootloader (or, at least, it's FAR easier)
[07:37] <CowEdgy> hmm but i installed dapper first then the alternate CD of edgy
[07:37] <slinky_> Orangekid13: sorry i'm not using sata and don't want to misinform you
[07:38] <Orangekid13> i'm not unwilling
[07:38] <Orangekid13> i just cant find the right site
[07:38] <Orangekid13> what's the url for the grub main page i was told to read
[07:38] <po0f> Orangekid13: Do you mean "man" page?
[07:38] <somerville32> !grub

[07:38] <Vuen> i accidentally killed kwin, now i can't open a console to start it again. how can i start it from tty1?
[07:38] <mneptok> Orangekid13: install Ubuntu to that second drive. at the end of the install procedure you will be guided through installing GRUB to the MBR of the primary device and setting up the boot menu to boot both Windows and Ubuntu.

[07:40] <Vuen> slinky_: erm, yes, but it's likely to be very complicated
[07:40] <sciboy> po0f, Are you using QT4?

[07:46] <Ayabara> anyone running vmware-server under ubuntu? every time I boot it says that vmware is not configured and that I must run vmware-config.pl
[07:47] <po0f> sciboy: Crapped out at the same spot.
[07:47] <mneptok> Ayabara: you need to install vmware-tools on the client
[07:47] <QwertyM> neno, use sudo mv /actual-location /var/www/ to move files into /var/www
[07:47] <Geoffrey2> CowEdgy, however, it's still suggested you not write to NTFS from Linux if at all possible
[07:47] <CowEdgy> !fuse
[07:47] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[07:47] <sciboy> po0f, Error message?
[07:47] <neno> thank you very much :)
[07:47] <Ayabara> mneptok, vmware-tools are installed
[07:48] <CowEdgy> what are the possible problems on writing to NTFS?
[07:48] <mneptok> Ayabara: did you then run the Perl script that's being referenced?
[07:48] <mneptok> CowEdgy: complete FS corruption and loss.
[07:48] <po0f> sciboy: I needed libglew-dev.
[07:48] <Ayabara> mneptok, yep. I run it every time I start my machine :-/
[07:48] <CowEdgy> ouch!
[07:48] <CowEdgy> ok.. i'll probably just read
[07:49] <CowEdgy> :)
[07:49] <sciboy> K
[07:49] <tonyyarusso> CowEdgy: It's a closed specification, so anything that lets you do it is just guessing about how.  Therefore, nothing's guaranteed to work.  Blame MS for not releasing specs for their FS.
[07:49] <mneptok> CowEdgy: install the ext3 driver for Windows and use ext3 for shared storage.
[07:49] <CowEdgy> ext3 is installed on windows?
[07:49] <slinky_> Ouch! ubuntu does not support writing to an NTFS drive
[07:50] <CowEdgy> i'm not familiar with it
[07:50] <mneptok> CowEdgy: no, but there's a 3rd party driver - http://fs-driver.org
[07:50] <tonyyarusso> CowEdgy: You can get ext3 drivers for windows.  Not by default.
[07:50] <CowEdgy> oh ic..
[07:50] <Surghi> question to shellscripting:  I just did:   "ls ./foo/bar/*.jpg"  then "pwd"  then I copied  the path from pwd,  added  /foo/bar/ and *.jpg and set a GIMP in the front.   Can this be made to only 1 command?
[07:50] <CowEdgy> that would prevent corruption?
[07:50] <mneptok> CowEdgy: it allows Windows to use ext3, rather than forcing Linux to use ntfs
[07:51] <tonyyarusso> CowEdgy: Which is generally safer.
[07:51] <CowEdgy> oh ok... thanks a lot for the info
[07:51] <CowEdgy> :)
[07:51] <mneptok> CowEdgy: as ext3 is an open format, the creators of ext3 tools for Windows can do a far better job than someone trying to reverse-engineer ntfs
[07:51] <Geoffrey2> I believe, strictly speaking, the driver allows Windows to use ext2...
[07:51] <po0f> Surghi: gimp `ls ./foo/bar/*.jpg`
[07:51] <mneptok> Geoffrey2: no, it allows ext3
[07:52] <Surghi> po0f: thank you!   and if I wanted to open all files in kwrite which contain the word  "foo"  (using GREP)
[07:52] <Surghi> po0f, what can I all do with  |   (the pipe sign)
[07:52] <slinky_> Vuen: If I install Dapper after I install XP using NTFS on my 320GB drive, I won't be able to write to the XP partition? Am I understanding this correct?
[07:52] <Geoffrey2> mneptok, ok, then I guess the driver I downloaded only allows ext2....
[07:53] <mneptok> slinky_: no mater what order you install your OSes, Linux cannot write to NTFS reliably.
[07:53] <mneptok> +t
[07:53] <jsjc> Also I have a question I have a live cd distro called Backtrack that uses madiwifi drivers and my wireless cards works perfect but in Ubuntu the drivesrs that come in the restricted modules they do not work, anyone could help me??
[07:53] <jsjc> anyone uses dell laptops with the dell mediadirect button?? It is anyone abel to boot mediadirect with grub?
[07:53] <po0f> Surghi: kwrite `ls | grep foo`
[07:54] <mneptok> a large, seperate partition you use for /home in Linux is the best solution. then mount that partition in Windows when you need to.
[07:54] <slinky_> I am writing fine to a Vfat32 drive right now, should I use vfat32 for my new XP install, but I won't get encryption on the internet if i don't use NTFS
[07:54] <i\o> I'm trying to get 3d acceleration working for my sis card but I don't know where to start, what should I do?
[07:55] <Menisk> What type of SIS i/o
[07:55] <noiesmo> Geoffrey2, check this http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/ext2ifs.htm
[07:55] <Surghi> po0f: so this would only grep files from the current directory, right?
[07:55] <Menisk> i.o: 630?
[07:55] <ThePub> slinky_: ntfs is really the only way to go with xp
[07:55] <Surghi> po0f, thank you very much for your help!
[07:55] <po0f> Surghi: Correct, add a directory to ls to change it.
[07:55] <CowEdgy> wow! ext3 is great!
[07:55] <Surghi> thank you po0f
[07:55] <i\o> Menisk, I'm not sure.. when I do a 'lspci -v' it says that its 661/741/760/761
[07:55] <po0f> Surghi: np  ;)
[07:55] <ThePub> CowEdgy: how's that?  it's EXT2 with journalling bolted on.
[07:55] <Surghi> CowEdgy, how makes you think so?
[07:55] <Menisk> i/o: O-o
[07:55] <Ryan`\> hah
[07:56] <Menisk> O_o
[07:56] <Surghi> :)
[07:56] <Ryan`\> I wish I could get ext3 done on my Cobalt Qube3
[07:56] <CowEdgy> i've read their site
[07:56] <CowEdgy> :D
[07:56] <QwertyM> :(( how do you install mouse pointers in Ubuntu ?
[07:56] <Ryan`\> I'm tired of 2.2.16.
[07:56] <i\o> Menisk, any idea?
[07:56] <Menisk> i/o: Nuh.
=== ubitux|shower is now known as ubitux
[07:56] <Menisk> Try ubotu
[07:56] <slinky_> I have my new system coming in a few days and i want to install XP on this system but not lose my Dapper, I have a spare vfat32 drive I am using for storage right now
[07:56] <po0f> Ryan`\: What distro still uses 2.2?
[07:56] <CowEdgy> with what i've read, it's nice... (for someone who haven't tried it)
[07:56] <CowEdgy> :)
[07:56] <i\o> how?
[07:57] <Menisk> !3d accelleration

[07:57] <Menisk> !3d acceleration
[07:57] <po0f> Ryan`\: Cobalts are SPARCs aren't they?

[07:57] <QwertyM> :p
[07:57] <i\o> that bot should pm
[07:57] <Ryan`\> po0f: the Q1 and Q2 are sparc, yes. The Qube3 is x86
[07:57] <Menisk> !ubotu
[07:57] <Menisk> :P
[07:58] <QwertyM> lol
[07:58] <Menisk> :P
[07:58] <JoePits> so i just deleted the boot partition becuase im throuhg with windows... how would i go about replacing grub and then filling hte empty space with my ext3
[07:58] <Ryan`\> po0f: the Raq4 is x86 as well
[07:59] <slinky_> mneptok: Would the easiest think for me to do is to install xp pro/ntfs on my spare drive first and then reinstall Dapper on my second drive and rebuilt it?
[07:59] <CowEdgy> ThePub, are there articles i could read on the advantages and disadvantages (comparison) on different file systems?
[07:59] <Menisk> Whats the difference between i386 and i686
[07:59] <slinky_> 32 bits hehe
[07:59] <po0f> Ryan`\: Anything stopping you from compiling your own kernel?
[07:59] <Ryan`\> yep
[07:59] <Ryan`\> I have to flash the proms and everything to setup an ext3 kernel
[08:00] <JoePits> ok i think ill have to use the livecd
[08:00] <Ryan`\> not only that, I do not believe the later kernels support RAID1
[08:00] <po0f> Ryan`\: Forgive my ignorance, I haven't seen a Sun machine before, much less used one.
[08:01] <Ryan`\> You'd be suprised how few have.
[08:01] <con-man> E: /var/cache/apt/archives/libberylsettings-dev_0.1.3~0beryl2_i386.deb: trying to overwrite `/usr/lib/libberylsettings.so', which is also in package libberylsettings0
[08:02] <po0f> Ryan`\: At least I knew whwt it was, eh?
[08:02] <QwertyM> oh nvm, found gcursor
[08:03] <po0f> CowEdgy: It depends on your situation.
[08:03] <slinky_> Vuen: Would it be easier to install XP Pro/NTFS on my spare drive first and then reinstall Dapper on my second drive and rebuild linux
[08:03] <Ayabara> CowEdgy, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems
[08:04] <slinky_> i have all my data backed up with Mondo
[08:04] <ubun> is nautilus also the entire 'desktop'? not just the program
[08:04] <dabaR> CowEdgy: http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=linux+filesystems+comparison&btnG=Google+Search&meta=
[08:04] <CowEdgy> thanks
[08:04] <CowEdgy> :)
[08:05] <po0f> ubun: Yes, Nautilus also draws the desktop.
[08:05] <ubun> cool
[08:05] <ubun> cause it was acting just like nautilus acts
[08:05] <QwertyM> hehe
[08:06] <devin_> Would it be possible to mount /home in fstab to a seprate hdd?
[08:06] <sciboy> po0f, Report!
[08:06] <spx2> can i change contrast in ubuntu ?
[08:06] <dabaR> devin_: off course, you can mount any partition as your home
[08:06] <po0f> sciboy: The download seemed to be missing some of it's own files.
[08:06] <neno> where is apache located in the file system? sorry if it's a stupid question. And how to you use sudo to delete something?
[08:06] <slinky_> everything I an reading says XP should be installed first :(
[08:06] <sciboy> O_o?
[08:07] <dabaR> slinky_: which is true.
[08:07] <Vuen> slinky_: possibly, yes
[08:07] <QwertyM> neno, to remove via sudo use 'sudo rm filename
[08:07] <ubun> i installed xp first, no problems that way
[08:07] <Vuen> slinky_: xp should definitely be installed first. it's the only real recommended way
[08:07] <tom_kelleher> is it possible to make my 4th mouse button work in Firefox
[08:07] <Vuen> slinky_: sorry :(
[08:07] <spx2> slinky_: ofcourse because XP doesnt care if you have linux and rewrites the mbr so that linux is no more accesible and you will have to overcome this by booting from a live cd and running lilo -b /dev/hda   or something like that
[08:07] <neno> thank you QwertyM
[08:07] <slinky_> I'll bite the bullet and just rebuild everything, its good proctice, thanks guys
[08:07] <QwertyM> neno, apache must be under /usr/share/ ?
[08:07] <spx2> can i change contrast in ubuntu ?
[08:07] <ubun> tom_kelleher:  there's a firefox plugin called umm mouse gestures i think
[08:08] <QwertyM> neno, also, for removing directories you can use sudo rm -r name
[08:08] <QwertyM> do a man rm
[08:08] <po0f> sciboy: It errored out on missing headers, openpluginlib.hpp something or other.
[08:08] <spx2> neno: rm -rf name actually...
[08:08] <devin_> dabaR i have a 120gb drive now with kubuntu on it but that i rather just use for my /home for ubuntu. would i need to delete all the partitions on it first?
[08:08] <neno> thanks QwertyM, you've helped me immensely
[08:09] <neno> thanks spx2
[08:09] <dabaR> devin_: no, just point to the partition you want in fstab
[08:09] <spx2> dabaR: can you expalin more ?
[08:09] <tom_kelleher> ubun ; will that make my side button go back a page like it does in XP?
[08:09] <Geoffrey2> for me that's both the most novel and perplexing part about Linux....just about any aspect of Linux (file system, desktop, etc) can be handled by any one of multiple applications...coming from Windows, that's quite an adjustment
[08:09] <QwertyM> wookay spx2 I thought that meant reformat ?
[08:09] <NoonInSF> Huge problem with ubuntu and internet access. has anyone heard of linux causing a cable modem to log off. Keep in mind the linux machine is not actually connected to the modem it is going through a wirless router.
[08:09] <ubun> tom_kelleher: dunno i havent used it
[08:11] <SeyToN> whos running wifi with wpa pass?
[08:11] <devin_> dabaR well on the drive i want to use for my /home has partitions like 30gb for / and the the rest for /home id like to use all of it for /home tho =/ not sure what to do
[08:11] <tonyyarusso> SeyToN: Me, via NetworkManager.  Worked right away.
[08:11] <Menisk> SeyToN: Whats your problem?
[08:11] <SeyToN> yeah
[08:11] <SeyToN> just the wpa pass
[08:12] <NoonInSF> is it possible for my linux machine to be sending messages to my cable modem through the router? or is that impossible?
[08:12] <majickmann> linux doesn't shut down cable modem...
[08:12] <SeyToN> well have a look to this
[08:12] <duncanm> is there a way to get more verbose output from apt?
[08:13] <po0f> NoonInSF: Are you serving from your Linux box?  Your ISP might not like that, and disced you theirselves.
[08:13] <duncanm> i'm having trouble upgrading ri1.8 and rdoc1.8
[08:13] <tonyyarusso> duncanm: I'll bet there's a -v switch.
[08:13] <SeyToN> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36396/
[08:13] <NoonInSF> serving? nope preatty sure i'm not po0f
[08:14] <po0f> NoonInSF: No Apache, FTP, or heavy torrent/p2p traffic?
[08:14] <majickmann> Why do you believe cable modem is "logging off"?
[08:14] <NoonInSF> the only thing i've done since a normal ubuntu desktop install was adding support for my airport card.
[08:14] <NoonInSF> one person on my network playing wow
[08:15] <NoonInSF> but there were two people playing wow for 5 hours...and they didn't cut that off ;-)
[08:15] <duncanm> seems like  ri1.8.4-5ubuntu1.2 is busted
[08:15] <ubun> for some reason sound isnt working when i watchin flash movies on youtube anymore. any ideas why? it was working yesterday (before i installed more multimedia apps/codecs)
[08:15] <kuto> hi
[08:15] <kuto> hi
[08:15] <SeyToN> hi
[08:15] <jsjc> Also I have a question I have a live cd distro called Backtrack that uses madiwifi drivers and my wireless cards works perfect but in Ubuntu the drivesrs that come in the restricted modules they do not work, anyone could help me??
[08:15] <jsjc> anyone uses dell laptops with the dell mediadirect button?? It is anyone abel to boot mediadirect with grub?
[08:15] <boink> hi
[08:16] <NoonInSF> i just want to make sure that it could not be ubuntu, it's just has happend one too many times for it to be coincidence
[08:16] <duncanm> dpkg: error processing ri1.8 (--remove):

[08:17] <NoonInSF> can you expand a bit on that majickmann?
[08:17] <ebryn_> anybody else got their ps3 running feisty?
[08:17] <Zelda> hey everyone.
[08:18] <tom_kelleher> ubun: I got it to work with a simple edit of the xorg.conf file
[08:18] <pegger_> re
[08:18] <Zelda> hey can someone help me?
[08:18] <Jordan_U> kuto: Now that I look at it that link is probably more than you need / want to kow
[08:18] <Jordan_U> *know
[08:18] <Zelda> I need to know if someone knows where I can get ati video card drivers
[08:19] <SeyToN> <Menisk> SeyToN: Whats your problem?<--- my network manager doesnt detect my wifi card, take a look http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36396/
[08:19] <Jordan_U> !ati | Zelda
[08:19] <ubotu> Zelda: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:19] <majickmann> say you have three nodes (pc/linux/router/switch) on network...  a fourth is added which happens to have static ip.
[08:19] <ubun> tom_kelleher:  how did you get the navigation button thing working exactly?
[08:19] <Zelda> cause I cant change my resolution higher then 1024X768
[08:19] <majickmann> and the static ip matches one of the original nodes...
[08:19] <Zelda> thanks
[08:19] <Zelda> this is cool. I just installed Ubuntu.
[08:19] <tom_kelleher> ubun: I found a 'correction' to the xorg.conf file on the forums
[08:19] <NoonInSF> hmm...don't i've got anything requireing a static ip.
[08:20] <majickmann> Duplicate ip then congests network with errors...
[08:20] <tom_kelleher> ubun: simple copy and paste and it works great
[08:20] <Menisk> SeyToN: Do you have drivers for your card
[08:20] <NoonInSF> i have a mac/linux/airport router/cable modem
[08:20] <SeyToN> yes i do
[08:20] <majickmann> Although I haven't seen very often.. could DHCP have issued a duplicate?
[08:21] <Zelda> ok where can I get that driver?
[08:21] <NoonInSF> coudl have.
[08:21] <majickmann> Can you check for dup ip?
[08:21] <NoonInSF> if i knew how it could
[08:21] <tom_kelleher> ubun: specifically this page http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=230293
[08:21] <ubun> thanks
[08:21] <majickmann> on linux = ifconfig
[08:21] <majickmann> on winboze = ipconfig
[08:21] <Menisk> SeyToN: I have no idea, maybe try pppoeconf and see if it can see the card as an ethernet interface
[08:22] <majickmann> each will give ip of respective device
[08:22] <Jordan_U> SeyToN: Did you disable it in network-admin?
[08:22] <tom_kelleher> how can I install all of the add ons I need for stuff, like flash, quicktime, and video codecs
[08:22] <PORDO> anyone know of a usb speakerphone that works in linux, or ubuntu by default?
[08:22] <PORDO> tom_kelleher you need the restricted formats.

[08:23] <SeyToN> its enable
[08:24] <Jordan_U> SeyToN: Disable it, then network-manager will "see" it.
[08:25] <SeyToN> how do i restart the network manager?
[08:25] <majickmann> NoonInSF:  when you said the cable modem is logging off...  what happens?   Does the c-m power down?
[08:26] <majickmann> I understand that troubleshooting now may present problems.
[08:26] <majickmann> blah...
[08:27] <Jordan_U> SeyToN: I don't know, there is a way but it might be easier to just reboot
[08:28] <ubun> after i make changes to xorg.conf do i have to do somethin for changes to take effect?
[08:28] <SeyToN> sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[08:28] <Jordan_U> ubun: Yes, you have to restart X, you can do that by pressing ctrl+alt+backspace
[08:29] <Jordan_U> SeyToN: But that won't restart the nework-manager daemon AFIK

[08:45] <wellex> yeah
[08:45] <wellex> :)
[08:45] <}DrSlump{> the problem is that ubuntu does not detect correctly the onboard wireless adaptor
[08:45] <wellex> my server using ECS and ubuntu work on it
[08:45] <wellex> i mean motherboard
[08:45] <}DrSlump{> it is based on realtek rtl8187l chip
[08:45] <Wiseguy> Menisk, there isnt one in my BIOS... but this is a laptop and when i modprobed for i2c-i801 it found a device... so im thinking i might have one
[08:46] <}DrSlump{> it's an usb2 wireless adaptor.. it works fine under windows, ant i use it to connect to my wireless router
[08:47] <kamarang> d
[08:47] <}DrSlump{> how can i do?
[08:47] <jongt> is there a command to view whats on the default runlevel?
[08:48] <}DrSlump{> there are official drivers too, here: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PFid=1&Level=6&Conn=5&ProdID=36&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false&Downloads=true
[08:48] <}DrSlump{> but i'm unable to install them :(
[08:48] <Menisk> Wiseguy: thats all i could think of
[08:49] <Menisk> Wiseguy: Maybe get samurise for windows and see if it can detect a motherboard monitor, because it has a plugin for them
[08:49] <po0f> jongt: ls /etc/rc5.d
[08:50] <po0f> jongt: But I could be wrong.
[08:50] <jongt> isnt there an update-rc.d command?
[08:51] <jo6n> jongt, you must check the initab
[08:51] <jo6n> I think the command to update init is telinit
[08:52] <floating> Wha shold I do? I opened add/remove program, and chose to uninstall 2 programs and install 2 programs, and the add/remove screen seems to be freezed, it might have updated something but not all since it is freezed
[08:52] <jongt> jo6n, im trying to get 915resolution working and I think i have to add it to default runlvl
[08:53] <jo6n> may I know which linux OS you are using?
[08:53] <jongt> kubuntu
[08:53] <jongt> i think its something with update-rc.d
[08:53] <jo6n> coll.. if its edgy ie the new version...
[08:53] <jongt> yea its edgy
[08:54] <jo6n> its doesn't use the systemV initiailization
[08:54] <jo6n> ie no rc levels
[08:54] <jongt> o
[08:54] <jongt> i used gentoo for a little
[08:54] <jongt> s0 thats kind of my thinking
[08:55] <jo6n> hmmm... Believe be you can find a nice documentation in unbuntu's official website itself
[08:55] <jo6n> L love unbuntu :D
[08:55] <jongt> eh
[08:55] <somerville32> I love Ubuntu too!
[08:55] <somerville32> :D
[08:56] <jongt> i got this because i realized gentoo wasnt a great rookie distro
[08:56] <rastilin> jongt, did you use the 700MB install cd or the 60MB one?
[08:56] <jo6n> well... it depends... gentoo is not that good for a newbie.. ;)
[08:57] <jongt> Rastilin, 700mb, why?
[08:57] <rastilin> jongt, Because if you'd used the 60MB, you'd have figured it out much sooner.
[08:58] <jo6n> btw jongt, can you please explain what you mean by "trying to get 915resolution working".. I am not a genious or geek... I will give out a try
[08:58] <jongt> thanks
[08:59] <jongt> i followed the howto for ubuntu and 915resolution
[08:59] <jongt> edited /etc/default/915Resolution
[08:59] <jongt> changed the modes in my xorg.conf
[08:59] <jo6n> hmmm...
[08:59] <jongt> and thats all
[08:59] <jongt> and its in /etc/rc5.d
[08:59] <jongt> so im guessing it tries to start
[08:59] <rastilin> jongt, hold on, I'm just wondering why you need to install this, doesn't X self-configure with the 915?
[09:00] <jo6n> rastilin, good question
[09:00] <jongt> rastilin, it does but im actually on the 945 with resolution 1280x768 but the biggest res i can get currently is 1024x768
[09:01] <jo6n> hmmm...
[09:01] <rastilin> jongt, So if I understand right, you have a 945 chip with 1280x768, but you can't select any resolution higher than 1024x768, and it shows up like a 915?
[09:02] <jongt> your right about the 1024x768, im just using the 915Resolution because that allows it to run bigger resolutions
[09:02] <jongt> im using the i810 driver
[09:02] <McBain> hi... can anyone help me with a grub problem?
[09:02] <rastilin> McBain, yes.
[09:03] <rastilin> jongt, It might be a problem with the x server's drivers. In any case you should check the configuration file "xorg.conf" and see what resolutions are configured.
[09:03] <jongt> rastilin, what where you saying about the 60mb install
[09:04] <McBain> rastilin: i'v looking for a guide on how to reinstall the grub bootloader after having installed windows.
[09:04] <rastilin> jongt, the 60MB minimal disk only provides command line and a compiler. You're expected to partition your drive, download the stage files and unpack your system by hand. The 700MB livecd is only a recent addition, the minimal disk is how people used to install gentoo.
[09:05] <rastilin> jongt, Not to mention compiling the kernel, installing grub, configuring it by hand, etc...
[09:05] <jongt> thats still how it was done last time i did it
[09:05] <jongt> well cause i think the livecd wasn't working right
[09:05] <magic_ninja> is there a themes package for gtk?
[09:05] <jongt> im coming from gentoo, i think its wierd how this is actually harder
[09:05] <rastilin> jongt, That's a common complaint, it seems to fail a lot.
[09:05] <jongt> it worked on my desktop but not on the lappy
[09:05] <rastilin> jongt, I used to use gentoo too, trust me, this is MUCH faster.
[09:06] <jongt> rastilin, do you know where inittab is?
[09:06] <po0f> jongt: You used Gentoo thinking all distros are alike.
[09:06] <po0f> jongt: You found out the hard way they are not.  ;)
[09:06] <rastilin> po0f, they are, sort of
[09:06] <jongt> rastilin, yea the package manager here is alot faster but gentoo is quick otherwise
[09:06] <rastilin> jongt, unless something fails to compile properly, then it's debugging time
[09:06] <po0f> rastilin: If by "alike" you mean uses Linux as a kernel then yes they are.
[09:07] <rastilin> jongt, or some libraries fail to link properly and you have to play "find the library".
[09:07] <magic_ninja> do gnome themes come available via gnome themes package
[09:07] <jongt> rastilin, yea gentoo was tough but i got everything working ok, then i tried to follow a howto without actually knowing what i was doing and broke gnome
[09:08] <jongt> does anyone know where inittab is?
[09:08] <rastilin> inittab?
[09:09] <jongt> isnt there usually a /etc/inittab
[09:09] <floating> Wha shold I do? I opened add/remove program, and chose to uninstall 2 programs and install 2 programs, and the add/remove screen seems to be freezed, it might have updated something but not all since it is freezed
[09:09] <rastilin> Yeah, but apparently not in Ubuntu.
[09:09] <rastilin> floating, we get it
[09:09] <rastilin> floating, have you tried terminating it?
[09:10] <floating> no
[09:10] <floating> should i terminate ?
[09:11] <rastilin> floating, well, it might help?
[09:12] <AstralJava> jongt: My Dapper install certainly has /etc/inittab
[09:12] <rastilin> My Edgy does not.
[09:13] <jongt> yea mine neither
[09:13] <floating> How can I know what name does it have in process manager ?
[09:13] <jongt> i thought it was pretty standard
[09:13] <crimsun> jongt: edgy dropped sysvinit and only provides compatibility.
[09:13] <crimsun> jongt: see upstart.ubuntu.com
[09:13] <crimsun> jongt: therefore, new edgy installs will not contain an /etc/inittab
[09:14] <crimsun> jongt: dist-upgrades from prior to edgy preserve /etc/inittab
[09:14] <jongt> crimsun, gotcha thanks
[09:15] <AstralJava> Thought it had to do with it, thanks crimsun.
[09:15] <jongt> maybe i should get dapper
[09:17] <Zelda> can someone help me get my sound working?
[09:18] <Jordan_U> Zelda: Do you use flash?
[09:18] <mneptok> jongt: if you're getting Dapper to avoid Upstart you might as well leave Ubuntu entirely. we'll be using Upstart from now on. either adapt or move elsewhere, i'm afraid. (not to sound harsh).
[09:18] <somerville32> !sound | zelda
[09:18] <ubotu> zelda: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[09:19] <Zelda> thanks. Im a new user to linux based stuff. Im going to need help
[09:19] <crimsun> Zelda: when are you experiencing sound problems?
[09:20] <crimsun> (i.e., for what applications?)
[09:21] <Zelda> well I just installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu on my system. I dont have everything setup right. I need help getting stuff working. I
[09:21] <Zelda> I am new to the linux community.
[09:21] <somerville32> Welcome Zelda! :)
[09:21] <Zelda> and Im trying to read some
[09:21] <crimsun> Zelda: right, but when did you notice that sound isn't working?
[09:21] <Zelda> at anytime.
[09:22] <somerville32> Zelda: Are you trying to play mp3s?
[09:22] <Zelda> trying to play cds, radio from internet.
[09:22] <Zelda> I just tried something.
[09:22] <rastilin> Zelda, mp3 encoded radio?
[09:22] <mneptok> Zelda: regular audio CDs? or CDs with encoded files?
[09:22] <Zelda> well radio thats in Amatok
[09:22] <somerville32> Zelda: Do you know how to use pastebin?
[09:22] <somerville32> Zelda: Did you get any errors?
[09:22] <Zelda> no, regular store bought cds.
[09:22] <crimsun> Zelda: ok, can you open a Terminal (Applications> Accessories> Terminal) and paste the following command? ``asoundconf list && amixer''  Then take the output from that command, and paste it onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[09:23] <k31th> you guys use irssi or xchat?
[09:23] <somerville32> k31th, xchat
[09:23] <FirstStrike> xchat
[09:23] <mneptok> k31th: irssi and jIRCii
[09:23] <Zelda> ok crimsun. let me check my sound first.
[09:23] <SeyToN> xchat
[09:23] <crisp> both
[09:23] <Zelda> I switched sound devices.
[09:24] <floating> I am looking for a lightweight torrent manager for multiple torrents, any tips ?
[09:25] <rastilin> floating, Azureus is always your best bet
[09:25] <starz> hey has anyone tried xmms2 ?
[09:25] <somerville32> !torent | floating
[09:25] <FirstStrike> azureus isn't really light weight though

[09:26] <Zelda> ok I have my sound device set to Dell Sound Blaster Live!
[09:26] <starz> i run inside a screen from the target dir
[09:26] <starz> also rtorrent is popular
[09:26] <neno> what's the installation path of firefox? if anyone could help me
[09:26] <SeyToN> !psyco
[09:26] <Zelda> I am playing streaming radio from Amarok, and no sound.
[09:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about psyco - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:26] <starz> neno, try 'locate firefox'
[09:26] <Zelda> I dont think the drivers are installed correctly.
[09:26] <Zelda> and its not muted, and the volume is up all the way.
[09:26] <crimsun> Zelda: I'm sure they're installed correctly. It's a volume issue.
[09:27] <Zelda> ok help me.
[09:27] <Zelda> please.
[09:27] <floating> starz: how does it work having multiple torrents at once, like 5 or more
[09:27] <crimsun> Zelda: I gave you some instructions above; please follow them.
[09:27] <FirstStrike> It helps the people that are trying to help you when you read what they're telling you to do.
[09:27] <floating> I tried bittornado, but it wanted to open up many windows, while some guied managers can control them in one window
[09:28] <floating> text-based client with control in one window for all torrents would be best
[09:28] <carzzz215> can someone check my sound info on the paste site.....i also have sound problems
[09:28] <floating> without too many special comands
[09:28] <crimsun> carzzz215: URL?
[09:28] <carzzz215> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36403/
[09:29] <neno> i  tried 'locate firefox' but it's given me a HEAP of entries
[09:29] <crimsun> carzzz215: you need to compile newer alsa-driver.
[09:29] <rastilin> neno, those are your firefox files
[09:29] <k31th> Yeah iv used irssi for years just not sure if i should change over to xchat or not...
[09:29] <Zelda> Crimsun: Ok, I copied and pasted it.
[09:29] <crimsun> Zelda: and which URL is it?
[09:29] <Ayabara> any recommendations on a good graphical svn client for ubuntu?

[09:30] <FirstStrike> /usr/share/firefox
[09:30] <starz> you limit upload bandwidth with --max_upload_rate 20
[09:30] <starz> and that 20 is 20KB/s
[09:30] <carzzz215> crimsun, how can you tell?
[09:30] <crimsun> carzzz215: because I've contributed to that sound driver.
[09:30] <starz> if you have bittornado in then youve automatically got that.. if not install bittornado-gui and youll have a gui client for when u just wanna start say one
[09:31] <Zelda> I got my video card working, I dont know how I got it
[09:31] <crimsun> Zelda: in that same Terminal, please execute this command: ``asoundconf set-default-card Live''
[09:31] <Zelda> all I did was cut and paste..
[09:31] <starz> utorrent is awesome for windows but you have tu run it in wine in linux and that makes it suck
[09:31] <crimsun> Zelda: afterward, you'll need to restart any sound applications.
[09:31] <floating> i see
[09:32] <FirstStrike> utorrent just got bought out by the owner of the original bittorrent
[09:32] <carzzz215> crimsun, actually i have tried to compile the never alsa but it wouldn't compile

[09:42] <Zelda> thats in there?
[09:43] <somerville32> Zelda: You need 1) Install the package 2) Modify xorg.conf to use nvidia driver (instead of nv) 3) restart X (or reboot)

[09:54] <frogzoo> gebruiker: actually where linux gets the tty fonts from is a good question
[09:54] <somerville32> malt: You could create a script that "wraps around" the command
[09:54] <somerville32> malt: You could do something at the firewall most likely

[09:55] <Zelda> somerville32: check pms

[09:56] <ion-weapon> etc init.d scripts are rnu on startup
[09:56] <crimsun> carzzz215: extract it, cd work/alsa-driver and follow the steps you used previously.
[09:56] <ion-weapon> remove ones with bad program
[09:56] <ion-weapon> usign vi
[09:56] <frogzoo> FSRxc: look in /etc/rc2.d/ & rename the script from S* to K*
[09:56] <FSRxc> Ok

[09:56] <carzzz215> crimsun, should i uninstall the original alsa?
[09:56] <jongt> anyone have any ideas why a configured 915resolution and xorg.conf is still giving me 1024x768 resolution when 1280x768 is native
[09:57] <frogzoo> gebruiker: a quick google points to consolechars
[09:57] <FSRxc> Now everytime it starts, it'll show the restart X screen
[09:57] <crimsun> carzzz215: when you install the new driver, it removes the older ones
[09:57] <carzzz215> crimsun, ok...do i need a new alsa-lib or alsa-utils?
[09:58] <somerville32> malt: No sorry
[09:58] <crimsun> carzzz215: no.
[09:58] <ion-weapon> u prob have config where it can chose many resos
[09:58] <ion-weapon> and the default is 1024
[09:58] <ion-weapon> in the file
[09:58] <ion-weapon> open in vi and comment out abd stuff
[09:58] <carzzz215> crimsun, ok thanks, i'm gonna try it
[09:58] <ion-weapon> bad
[09:58] <ion-weapon> linux is cool
[09:58] <ion-weapon> is ubuntu able to use recent kernel?
[09:59] <ademan> how do i figure out the ethernet interface of a specific card?  Or rather I've got an ethernet card and a wireless card, I want to find out if the wireless card is eth0 eth1 eth2 etc    It used to be in system->Administration->Networking, but it doesn't tell you that anymore
[10:00] <jongt> is edgy worth alot more advanced than dapper?
[10:00] <ademan> ah, it was in the device manager, just didn't see it
[10:00] <ion-weapon> ifconfig -a
[10:00] <ion-weapon> on xterm
[10:01] <ion-weapon> ifconfig -a|less
[10:01] <jongt> is there anyway to see if a program is started up with kubuntu
[10:01] <ademan> jongt: well its got a new version of Xorg, it supports composite with accelerated indirect glx, which rules
[10:01] <ion-weapon> ps -few
[10:01] <ion-weapon> guys learn the commadn line
[10:01] <ion-weapon> cmon
[10:01] <FSRxc> I'm trying to remember
[10:01] <FSRxc> lol
[10:02] <tonyyarusso> ion-weapon: Ubuntu's kernels in apt are not the most recent that you'll find from kernel.org, but they are fairly recent.  Also, you can compile your own if you wish.
[10:02] <ademan> ion-weapon: i know about ifconfig, it doesnt tell me which one is my wireless card though...
[10:02] <ion-weapon> it wont be eth0
[10:02] <tonyyarusso> ademan: Combining the output of ifconfig with that of lspci may be useful.
[10:02] <ion-weapon> itll be liek wh0
[10:02] <ion-weapon> or something
[10:02] <jongt> ademan - is dapper alot of work to get aiglx
[10:02] <ademan> well it actually was ion-weapon
[10:02] <ion-weapon> hm
[10:02] <tonyyarusso> ion-weapon: That's not true.  Sometimes eth0 is your wireless card.  Depends on the setup.
[10:02] <ion-weapon> so why u askin?
[10:02] <ion-weapon> ;)
[10:02] <ademan> jongt: it's impossible with the old version of xorg, well you could use Xgl, but Xgl is a hack
[10:03] <ademan> ion-weapon: i just found it in the device manager
[10:03] <ion-weapon> Im used to archlinux
[10:03] <jongt> ademan, do you like upstart?
[10:03] <ion-weapon> good for you
[10:03] <ademan> well it's time to try out kismet
[10:03] <ademan> jongt: honestly it's transparent to me, and boot times don't feel any faster, but they should be better in feisty
[10:03] <ion-weapon> postgresql is nice
[10:03] <ion-weapon> as is php
[10:03] <ion-weapon> and apache 2.2.3
[10:04] <ion-weapon> bash is pretty cool
[10:04] <jongt> ademan, edgy has xorg 7.1, dapper is 7.0?
[10:04] <pilzig> anyone ever bought at tuxgames.com? are they leigt?
[10:04] <ion-weapon> I wrote great file accounting program
[10:04] <pilzig> legit
[10:04] <tonyyarusso> ion-weapon: All of this is !offtopic, by the way.
[10:04] <crimsun> pilzig: yes.
[10:04] <pilzig> okay :)
[10:04] <ion-weapon> tony so no package maanger way to get new kernel
[10:04] <FSRxc> Does XGL work on dapper?
[10:04] <ion-weapon> got to compile?
[10:04] <pilzig> because im already waiting 1 week for a game
[10:04] <pilzig> :(
[10:04] <noiesmo> yes FSRxc

[10:08] <ColdFyre> SeyToN:  restore what part?
[10:08] <SeyToN> the whole thing
[10:08] <tonyyarusso> ion-weapon: It would involve temporarily enabling feisty repos.  You could ask about that (and the wisdom thereof) in #ubuntu+1.
[10:08] <ion-weapon> whats that
[10:08] <FSRxc> How can I rebuild the xorg.conf?
[10:08] <tonyyarusso> ion-weapon: The channel for development release discussion.

[10:09] <SeyToN> sources.list and wpasupplicant
[10:10] <ColdFyre> just edit the sources
[10:10] <ColdFyre> get a working copy off google or something
[10:10] <ColdFyre> there is no real restore afaik

[10:10] <ColdFyre> if things are way too broken re-install
[10:11] <ColdFyre> google for edgy osurces.list i guess
[10:11] <ColdFyre> sources.list rather
[10:11] <jongt> ademan, was aiglx easy to get goin in edgy?

[10:16] <FSRxc> HELP: got into gnome, and it says "Power Manager This program cannot start until you start the dbus system service. It is strongly recommended you reboot your computer after starting messagebus."
[10:17] <AstralJava> jongt: I don't think so, as you see in X.org configuration, it is stated that 32 is really 24 with something-I-can't-remember-now. So they probably treat 32 in the same way as 24, in that aspect.

[10:31] <sergevn> batoch: control+alt+backspace
[10:31] <batoch> echosystm: have you purged it first?
[10:31] <pickart> ok.
[10:31] <batoch> sergevn: no, that is only to restart
[10:31] <pickart> that means audiophile is set up.

[10:34] <echosystm> to another one
[10:34] <echosystm> lol
[10:34] <pickart> oh... that's out of my league...
[10:35] <echosystm> mmm
[10:35] <pickart> how about the sound, is it "slow", just a little slower than usual?
[10:35] <batoch> echosystm: whooo, you'd be better of on a different forum man
[10:35] <echosystm> setting the master clock thing would be a total shit
[10:35] <echosystm> audio seems fine to me
[10:35] <crimsun> echosystm: just use netjack.
[10:35] <echosystm> netjack?
[10:36] <crimsun> yes.
[10:36] <echosystm> educate me plz
[10:36] <echosystm> :P
[10:36] <pickart> was just wondering if you might get the same problem as i did. i got the sound about one half-tone slower.
[10:36] <crimsun> echosystm: I don't have time, sorry. Use a search engine.
[10:36] <echosystm> ok
[10:36] <echosystm> oh
[10:36] <echosystm> audio over ip doodad
[10:36] <pickart> hm?
[10:36] <echosystm> too much cpu :P

[10:38] <linopil> dont want to bork system because of alt+tab not working
[10:38] <jc-denton> hi all
[10:39] <jc-denton> can you fix the permissions of a ubuntu/debian system after you did chmod 644 /*
[10:39] <soundray> linopil: can't you use gnome keyboard shortcut preferences?
[10:39] <jc-denton> i mean is there a script or so that restores the original permissions
[10:39] <linopil> soundray, now on kde
[10:39] <tonyyarusso> jc-denton: Not that I'm aware of...  Was a recursive chmod I'm assuming?
[10:40] <jc-denton> not sure
[10:40] <jc-denton> i didn't do it
[10:40] <jc-denton> but a friend of mine
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> jc-denton: Take a look at the permissions under any subdirectory and see what they are, to check.
[10:40] <jc-denton> if you do strace su administrator
[10:40] <Hoggs> Uhmm...  I can't get Ubuntu OR XUbuntu to boot on my server. <_<
[10:41] <jc-denton> and then it stops because it does not have permissions to /etc/localtime
=== poh is now known as pohpoh
[10:42] <Hoggs> :/
[10:42] <soundray> Hoggs: it would help if you were a bit more specific
[10:42] <tonyyarusso> jc-denton: You may have gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle.
[10:42] <Hoggs> The little X for the mouse loads, then it just stops.
[10:43] <jc-denton> i didn't do that
[10:43] <jc-denton> but a friend just asked me
[10:44] <tonyyarusso> jc-denton: Ah.  Then they might be out of luck then.  (I have no idea how to recover a recursive chmod of the entire file structure unfortunately)
[10:44] <soundray> jc-denton: check whether permissions on $HOME/.dmrc are still 600. If they are, it wasn't a recursive chmod
[10:44] <jc-denton> ok
[10:45] <Hoggs> Err...
[10:45] <jc-denton> well i just asked because i think that debian maybe has as script or so to restore the permissions
[10:45] <soundray> Hoggs: check whether any errors are logged to /var/log/syslog and /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:45] <soundray> Hoggs: and stop erring. I know it's human ;)
[10:45] <echosystm> um

[10:54] <somerville32> Yes.
[10:54] <somerville32> It is a video driver issue

[10:56] <Hoggs> Alright.
[10:56] <somerville32> Driver: Try them again?
[10:56] <dreamer> ok
[10:57] <soundray> dreamer: you may find something useful in 'man nv'
[10:58] <frogzoo> who was looking to change the console font earlier?
[10:59] <glimmerati> thanks for your help with the eatherape.. but the ip I can see in the local Area .. I cannot log in to them.. plz tell me .. ??
[10:59] <dreamer> not really soundray, the nv-drivers should be okay for this videocard (GeForce 6200)
[10:59] <soundray> dreamer: I agree, but how does that correspond to my suggestion?
[11:00] <dreamer> not really, that's the only thing I can find in man nv
[11:00] <soundray> dreamer: what's the only thing?
[11:00] <dreamer> only relevant thing, nothing in respect to the problem I'm having
[11:00] <soundray> dreamer: look at the driver options
[11:01] <dreamer> hmm
[11:01] <glimmerati> thanks for your help with the eatherape.. but the ip I can see in the local Area .. I cannot log in to them.. plz tell me .. ??
[11:01] <soundray> glimmerati: this is for monitoring network usage, not for logging in to anything.
[11:02] <glimmerati> i need to log in for file sharing..
[11:02] <P2500> ... For some odd reason, I can't get access to my DVD recorder.
[11:02] <P2500> It's at /dev/cdrom0
[11:02] <dreamer> soundray: HW cursor? I really have no idea
[11:02] <glimmerati> i can see the ip.. i can log in to that pc from windows XP.. but I cannot access from uubunto
[11:03] <soundray> glimmerati: try Places-Connect to Server
[11:04] <soundray> dreamer: worth a try
[11:04] <jakob_dk> Hey, how can i install my raid driver... i got it for linux... just need to know how to install it... :S
[11:04] <dreamer> soundray: but what is a HW cursor ?
[11:05] <soundray> dreamer: HW cursor means your graphics card is in charge of handling the cursor. If you turn it off, nv will handle it instead.
[11:05] <dreamer> hmm, definatly werth a try then :)
[11:05] <soundray> jakob_dk: there is usually a README or INSTALL in the package
[11:06] <glimmerati> i already tried it.. and again tried it.. it is not working
[11:06] <SeyToN> anybody in here with mythtv installed?
[11:06] <soundray> dreamer: it may only refer to the mouse cursor, not the text one that you have trouble with...
[11:06] <soundray> SeyToN: is this a survey?
[11:06] <glimmerati> can I not connect directly to the ip I see from eatherape??
[11:06] <SeyToN> no
[11:07] <SeyToN> just a question
[11:07] <soundray> glimmerati: I already answered that
[11:08] <echosystm> does azurueus run as bad on linux as it does on windows?
[11:08] <glimmerati> i know.. it should work..
[11:08] <iturk> hi there anyone knows any free svn repository ?? by the way berlios.de its out of question they reject my project !! any other one ??
[11:09] <soundray> glimmerati: no, it shouldn't. etherape is a network monitor application. It's not for establishing connections.
[11:09] <P2500> iturk: What is your project?
[11:10] <dreamer> soundray: nope, that wasn't it, I'm trying the nvidia drivers now, hope they work better with this videocard :)
[11:10] <iturk> P2500: its a chess game they told me that they dont support more games due to lack of resources !!
[11:10] <glimmerati> no..no.. u didnt understand me.. I know eatherape.. my question was.,. is there any system to log into those ip's which i see from eather ape??
[11:10] <P2500> iturk: That sucks.
[11:10] <jakob_dk> soundray: oh ill try
[11:10] <soundray> dreamer: good luck. I take it you know where to find the ubuntu instructions?
[11:10] <dreamer> which one ?
[11:10] <frogzoo> glimmerati: easy way to tell would be run nmap
[11:10] <glimmerati> no using eatherape.. but may be using other softwere
[11:10] <nicola> do you know the hotkey to exit xvncviewer while fullscreen ? (to directly exit the program, not F8)
[11:11] <frogzoo> nicola: alt f4 ?
[11:11] <glimmerati> is it in the synoptc ??
[11:11] <nicola> let me try
[11:11] <soundray> glimmerati: only if the hosts at those IPs are sharing resources
[11:11] <glimmerati> ok.. and where/how can I get Nmap??
[11:12] <iturk> P2500: yes looks that open source people dont care about developing something that generates millions of money !!
[11:12] <soundray> glimmerati: you need to develop some initiative please
[11:12] <dreamer> soundray: the text-'cursor' seems to work better in OOo
[11:12] <soundray> dreamer: still on nv?
[11:12] <nicola> alt+f4 closed this but not the viewer
[11:12] <glimmerati> yes.. I got NmapFE and Knmap..
[11:13] <dreamer> soundray: no nvidia now
[11:13] <dreamer> with default options
[11:13] <tundejeg> hi
[11:13] <soundray> nicola: I don't think there is such a hotkey. Stick with F8
[11:13] <tundejeg> may i ask a question
[11:13] <frogzoo> !docs | dreamer
[11:13] <ubotu> dreamer: documentation is to be found at http://help.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com - General linux documentation: http://www.tldp.org - http://rute.2038bug.com
[11:13] <soundray> !ask | tundejeg
[11:13] <ubotu> tundejeg: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:13] <nicola> ok, thanks soundray
[11:13] <dreamer> soundray: got to do some mojar studying now, hopefully it will stay on and not crash like before ;/
[11:13] <echosystm> do any linux firesharing programs support upnp?
[11:13] <dreamer> frogzoo: why ?
[11:13] <tundejeg> how do i know that an APACHE is running on my ubuntu linux
[11:13] <echosystm> or do you ahve to forward ports?
[11:14] <Hoggs> I give up. :<
[11:14] <tundejeg> soundray
[11:14] <tundejeg> pls help me out
[11:14] <glimmerati> yes.. I got NmapFE and Knmap.... ok.. I will try both of them
=== linux1 is now known as homer_linux
[11:14] <homer_linux> hiya ppl
[11:14] <neno> hi, i've installed LimeWire for Linux but it won't start up, any suggestions
[11:14] <Madpilot> tundejeg, have you installed apache?
[11:15] <soundray> tundejeg: 'telnet localhost 80'. If you get a response, you have a web server running.
[11:15] <tundejeg> nope
[11:15] <Madpilot> tundejeg, it's not installed by default - do you want to run a webserver?
[11:15] <frogzoo> neno: it used to be that the config file was in dos format & had to be converted with dos2unix, not sure if that's still the case
[11:15] <tundejeg> yes
[11:16] <soundray> tundejeg: there is some useful info:
[11:16] <soundray> !lamp | tundejeg
[11:16] <ubotu> tundejeg: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[11:16] <homer_linux> hiya installed edgy 64 and now i dont have any graphical boot up screen any ideas whats up
[11:16] <soundray> neno: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash', answer no to the question
[11:17] <starz> ummm anyone manage to mount samba folders in fstab ?
[11:17] <frogzoo> !fixres | homer_linux
[11:17] <ubotu> homer_linux: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[11:17] <soundray> homer_linux: the splash in amd64 doesn't work for me either. Boot without the splash option.
[11:17] <homer_linux> frogzoo thanks :)
[11:18] <knoppix> alo
[11:18] <P2500> iturk: Then you might need to host yourself.
[11:18] <homer_linux> thanks soundray
[11:18] <neno> soundray: what do I  do?
[11:19] <iturk> P2500: i am waiting for the answer of sourceforge
[11:19] <Upayavira> About to do Dapper->Edgy upgrade. Any pointers to documentation on the process?
[11:19] <iturk> P2500: i hope that they are not closed minded
[11:20] <soundray> neno: 'gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst', find the line that says '#defoptions' and remove the string 'splash' from it. Save and run 'sudo update-grub'.
[11:20] <Upayavira> Ahh, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[11:20] <Upayavira> should have read the topic.
[11:20] <P2500> iturk: I hope so, too.
[11:20] <tundejeg> how do i install apache to use PHP
[11:21] <soundray> tundejeg: read the page that ubotu pointed you to earlier.
[11:21] <boink> yes, that's good
[11:21] <neno> soundray: what will that do? sorry, i'm really new to all this
[11:22] <soundray> neno: grub is the boot manager. The menu.lst file configures the menu where you choose a kernel at boot.
[11:23] <soundray> neno: the menu is configured automatically by update-grub, based on settings from the top of that file, e.g. defoptions.
[11:23] <neno> soudray: ok, but all i'm having trouble with is LimWire
[11:23] <soundray> neno: arrgh!
[11:23] <soundray> neno: wrong person. Sorry
[11:24] <neno> soundray: thats cool
[11:24] <neno> can anyone help me?
[11:24] <soundray> neno: edgy links /bin/sh to the dash shell. Limewire expects /bin/sh to link to the bash shell.
[11:25] <neno> i'm using Dapper
[11:25] <soundray> neno: do a 'ls -l /bin/sh' and see what it links to, then
=== voltz__ is now known as voltz
[11:26] <neno> soudray: it says it links to bash
[11:27] <soundray> neno: good. Have you got Sun java installed?
[11:27] <neno> i'm not sure
[11:27] <voltz> wondering if anyone is having trouble with random playing of songs using Rhythmbox ?
[11:27] <soundray> neno: install the sun-java5-jre package, then try limewire again
[11:27] <serge_>  What are the minimum specs for a laptop to do some decent work on it, like browsing IM and IRC.
[11:27] <serge_> for xubuntiu
[11:28] <neno> soundray: thank you, i'll try that
[11:28] <soundray> serge_: I don't know, but I have a Celeron 300MHz with 192MB RAM that works well enough with xubuntu
[11:29] <serge_> soundray: Ok thx, i have a P3 455mhz with 64 ram, so the bottleneck is the ram i think?
[11:29] <soundray> serge_: I guess 64MB is roughly the RAM minimum for your requirement
[11:30] <serge_> soundray: you mean to only "run" ubuntu, not work with it?
[11:30] <soundray> serge_: you will need a special install CD for that little RAM. Better to get a hold of some extra RAM from somewhere.
[11:30] <serge_> soundray: Ok thx :), what is that install cd called?
[11:30] <soundray> serge_: I responded specific to the app requirement you mentioned.
[11:31] <soundray> serge_: I can't remember, but you can't miss it on www.xubuntu.org
[11:31] <jongt> !915resolution
[11:31] <ubotu> 915resolution: resolution modification tool for Intel graphic chipset. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.5.2-4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 14 kB, installed size 128 kB (Only available for i386 amd64 kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64)
[11:32] <serge_> soundray: Hmm, my laptop is very very slow when i Browse, IRC and IM.
[11:32] <soundray> serge_: so you have it already?
[11:32] <serge_> soundray: yes.
[11:32] <soundray> serge_: xubuntu I mean
[11:32] <serge_> soundray: I already installed it.
[11:33] <Pie-rate> why does anyone even run those dinosaurs with <512mb ram these days?
[11:33] <Corbeaux> because they usually have them as a spare
[11:33] <Pie-rate> you save overall on power with a semimodern computer
[11:33] <soundray> serge_: your question should have been 'My laptop is very slow with Xubuntu. What can I do?' rather than about minimum requirements.
[11:33] <frogzoo> Pie-rate: because they can?
[11:33] <boink> pie-rate: sure, even with 128 mb
[11:34] <serge_> soundray: yeah sorry about that, my english grammer isnt that good :)
[11:34] <soundray> Pie-rate: maybe not everyone is steeped in money like you
[11:34] <soundray> serge_: that's a matter of common sense, not grammar.
[11:34] <Corbeaux> computers are cheap these days though so don't need to be "steeped in money" to have that view
[11:34] <Pie-rate> soundray: you save overall in power with a semi modern computer, and pretty much anyone should be able to come up with $100
[11:35] <Zober> Has anyone at all been able to install beryl on the new instal 965 Chipset w/ onboard video?
[11:35] <soundray> Corbeaux, Pie-rate: you're forgetting that a "semi-modern computer" still costs more than the average yearly wage in many parts of the world.
[11:36] <Corbeaux> true enough I guess, I'm from the Caribbean :)
[11:36] <frogzoo> what's with the .au repos? they are s l o w
[11:36] <Wiseguy> hey guys im trying to print to a printer that is shared on a windows PC... i see my print request come up in the printer queue on the windows box, but it says Error - Printing... what logfile would i look at to determine the problem?
[11:36] <Jeffm515> HuibertG1||: good news...

[11:42] <Wiseguy> does anyone know what any of this means?
[11:43] <axisme> wiseguy, sure you are using the right ppd?
[11:43] <Wiseguy> ppd?
[11:43] <axisme> yes
[11:43] <soundray> ajopaul_: add these lines to /etc/network/interfaces substituting the right values: iface eth0 inet static \\ address 192.168.1.2 \\ netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ gateway 192.168.1.1
[11:44] <Wiseguy> what is that?
[11:44] <frogzoo> Wiseguy: are you doing cups administration from the web page?
[11:44] <axisme> the file you downloaded for your printer
[11:44] <ajopaul_> soundray, had done tat wat next?
[11:44] <soundray> ajopaul_: then add 'nameserver 10.10.10.10' to /etc/resolv.conf (again substituting the proper IP address)
[11:44] <Wiseguy> i dont think i did download a file for my printer... i chose to use the hpijs driver from the list
[11:46] <ajopaul_> soundray, and then shud i restart any services like /etc/init.d/networking?
[11:46] <HeathenDan> is there a program for charting a woman's "fertile days" in ubuntu?
[11:46] <soundray> ajopaul_: either that, or try 'sudo ifup eth0'
[11:46] <frogzoo> HeathenDan: that's a woman's choice
[11:47] <HeathenDan> yeah, my wife's asking me to look for one
[11:47] <soundray> frogzoo: :D
[11:47] <Wiseguy> frogzoo, i am using the Add Printer function in the Administration list
[11:47] <frogzoo> HeathenDan: you can do that in evolution surely
[11:47] <neno> soundray: hi, i downloaded the java package, but it still wont work.
[11:48] <soundray> neno: how does it fail?

[11:48] <Narada> hi guys; which package does the command mail fall into?
[11:49] <neno> soundray: I go into the 'Application' menu at the top of the screen, go to 'Internet' and click on LimeWire, but it just doesn't start up

[11:53] <Onore_e_Gloria> i ve a problemi with samba
[11:53] <rob> !ask | sgbirch
[11:53] <ubotu> sgbirch: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:53] <Onore_e_Gloria> the pc with xp can see the linux files
[11:53] <Onore_e_Gloria> but linux pc can't see the xp files
[11:54] <niksavel> can any1 help me ... I have a fat32 partition that becomes read only all by itself during a few minutes of work (it's initially rw)...  and I have to remount it to be able to work again...  the most annoying problem however is that when it gets checked after 30 mounts at bootup I seem to loose all files added to it after the previous check and to add aditionally to the problem a load of previously deleted files appear - and are inaccessible...   any id
[11:54] <niksavel> eas any1?
[11:54] <Narada> soundray: what is the difference between those two
[11:54] <Narada> soundray: mailutils and mailx i mean; because they conflict
[11:54] <echosystm> when i was installing the nvidia drivers, someone told me to install linux-restricted-modules-(somethinghere)
[11:54] <rob> Onore_e_Gloria: have you tried going to Places -> Connect to server and entering your Windows PC details?
[11:54] <echosystm> any ideas what it was?
[11:54] <neno> soundray: i converted the .rpm into .deb, then ran dpkg
[11:54] <soundray> Narada: I don't know. Read the package descriptions with 'apt-cache show mailx'
[11:54] <Onore_e_Gloria> details like the workgroup?
[11:54] <sgbirch> uboto: Oh .. I just did.  I cannot seem to get printer sharing working under dapper. Worked find on breezy. I have done enable_browsinf, enable_sharing, I have reinstalled cups.
[11:55] <Narada> soundray: k
[11:55] <soundray> neno: in that case try 'dpkg -L packagename | grep bin'
[11:55] <rob> Onore_e_Gloria: you won't need to know the workgroup if you use that
[11:55] <rob> just host, etc
[11:55] <neno> soundray: so i just type that into the terminal?
[11:55] <sgbirch> uboto: I have RTFM every CUPS manual I could find and bought the SAMS book

[11:59] <jono> Darst: thanks! :)
[11:59] <Darst> mjr is gstreamer-properties done through the command line ?

[12:02] <gotit> But i have no other choice , have to install it
[12:03] <soundray> neno: 'sudo update-alternatives --config java' and make sure it points to the Sun one.
[12:04] <HeathenDan> yes... family planning is key to a good marriage
[12:04] <frogzoo> niksavel: anything that mentions timeouts means the disk is failing
[12:04] <sgbirch> Still looking for CUPS help ... is there a command line tool that will list all remote cups servers?
[12:04] <soundray> gotit: what's the name of the driver package you downloaded?
[12:04] <neno> soundray: so point it to the one with Sun in it's file name?
[12:05] <soundray> neno: yes
[12:05] <Darst> mjr thank you thank you thank you
[12:05] <semboy> how do i make the sound higher ?? please help me , i am on ubuntu edgy
[12:05] <Darst> mjr fixed many problems i was having around this whole concept...
[12:06] <kling0n> semboy: double-click the volume control and check PCM volume
[12:06] <soundray> semboy: you mean higher in pitch?
[12:06] <semboy> yeah
[12:07] <soundray> kling0n: he means higher in pitch...
[12:07] <neno> soundray: I have to thank very much for your help, thank you soooo much :D
[12:07] <kling0n> soundray: yea...
[12:07] <Arastoo> which is the best router i should buy
[12:07] <soundray> neno: it must be working, then ;)
[12:07] <frogzoo> there's a problem with the .au servers - they are running very slowly - don't know as the admins read this chan though
[12:07] <kling0n> semboy: do you want a general higher pitch? or just in your media player?
[12:07] <soundray> Arastoo: Linksys WRT54GL (note the 'L')
[12:08] <neno> soundray: yes, it is. Thank you for putting up with me
[12:08] <Arastoo> ok
[12:08] <semboy> kling0n higher pitch
[12:08] <soundray> neno: you're welcome, and sorry again for setting you off on the wrong track (still embarrassed...)
[12:09] <kling0n> semboy: that is not very specific...
[12:09] <semboy> kling0n just tell me how to make it higher
[12:09] <neno> soundray: That's cool, no harm done
[12:09] <kling0n> semboy: do you want to have some media files play with higher pitch? or do you want *everything* on your system (incl system sounds etc) to have higher pitch
[12:09] <kling0n> ?
[12:09] <Arastoo> soundray: why its the best
[12:09] <semboy> kling0n yes
[12:10] <frogzoo> Arastoo: cos  you can run openwrt on it
[12:10] <semboy> kling0n i am on youtube
[12:10] <Arastoo> wrt??
[12:10] <semboy> kling0n and i hear so not well
[12:10] <soundray> Arastoo: because it comes with enough memory and a wireless radio that is supported by OpenWrt
[12:10] <kling0n> semboy: I can't  research how to fix your issue if I don't know speficially what you want
[12:10] <frogzoo> Arastoo: http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware?action=show&redirect=toh
[12:10] <Arastoo> openwrt??
[12:10] <Arastoo> ok
[12:10] <kling0n> semboy: ...
[12:11] <kling0n> semboy: so you want youtube files to play with higher volume?
[12:11] <emile> i have an ubuntu(lts) readonly smb share with music. When i try to import the files in rhythmbox on remote client (edgy) i get 'could not read from resource' errors. Copying files using nautilus works with no problem, also the sound files work when using local. Any hints on what could be causing this issue?
[12:11] <semboy> kling0n I want to hear more clear this is the -> site http://youtube.com/watch?v=M2meZCM4Ols         i just want to hear a little higher
[12:11] <semboy> kling0n yesss
[12:12] <ajopaul> soundray: thanx did the net config stuff!
[12:12] <Arastoo> can i allow only 4 computers on 4 diffrent network with this wrt54gl
[12:13] <soundray> ajopaul: well done
[12:13] <kling0n> semboy: run gnome-volume-control and check that everything is turned up
[12:13] <kling0n> soundray: it seems to be volume after all :)

[12:14] <bippi> hi
[12:14] <HellioN-> Hello.
[12:14] <semboy> Kling0n okei now turnd up , i hear now better , i want to make it higher
[12:15] <semboy> Kling0n i guess there is no way :S
[12:15] <bippi> I upgrated to feisty and now ping 127.0.0.1 doesn't work anymore.. any ideas?
[12:15] <Arastoo> can i allow only 4 computers on 4 diffrent network with this wrt54gl
[12:16] <soundray> Arastoo: is that a question?
[12:16] <Arastoo> ofcourse
[12:16] <soundray> Arastoo: it helps to use a '?' sometimes
[12:16] <frogzoo> Arastoo: not with the stock firmware, but with openwrt anything's  possible but it's quite a lengthy process to learn to use it & set it up
[12:16] <soundray> Arastoo: what kind of router do you need?
[12:17] <Arastoo> i dont know, i have to share internet to 4 to 8 computer on 4 different network
[12:18] <soundray> Arastoo: what kind of networks are they?
[12:18] <Arastoo> simple switch networks
[12:18] <soundray> Arastoo: all ethernet?
[12:19] <niksavel> frogzoo: only one timeout msg partaining to hdc...  I only have one hddisk - hda
[12:19] <Arastoo> i guess

Copying files using nautilus works with no problem, also the sound files work when using local. Any hints on what could be causing this issue? <- https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gnome-vfs2/+bug/60326 seems to answer my question (a bug). When will a bugfix be applie
[12:20] <niksavel> frogzoo: and I believe it's during system bootup
[12:20] <frogzoo> niksavel: well obviously this isn't meant to happen.... paste the line for the partition from /etc/fstab
[12:20] <frogzoo> niksavel: yeh, a cd timeout is nothing
[12:20] <soundray> Arastoo: I'm not sure you need a router at all. Take a look at the Linux Network Admin Guide (http://www.dmsa.unipd.it/andreap/nag/nag.html). Then you'll be clearer on what you need and how to set it up.
[12:21] <Arastoo> its not even a site
[12:21] <frogzoo> Arastoo: if you had a lvl 3 switch (vlan capable) - you could do the routing from linux
[12:22] <niksavel> /dev/hda5    	/home/niksavel/windows/d   vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask=000  0    0
[12:22] <soundray> Arastoo: what do you mean?
[12:22] <Arastoo> its not opening
[12:22] <niksavel> and I used this one b4: /dev/hda5 /home/niksavel/windows/d vfat users,owner,rw,umask=000 0 0
[12:22] <soundray> Arastoo: you're not copying it correctly. Leave out the ( and the )
[12:22] <frogzoo> niksavel: what's with the funny character immediately before /home ?
[12:22] <niksavel> the first one I pasted didn't work as rw at all after initial edgy installadion, only read
[12:23] <niksavel> tab?
[12:23] <soundray> emile: you can work around this by mounting the share permanently via fstab instead of using gnome VFS.
[12:23] <Arastoo> frogzoo lvl 3 switch wats that
[12:23] <niksavel> so I came here and asked for help, somebody wrote me up that second I pasted
[12:23] <niksavel> I used that for a few weeks than this problems started
[12:24] <niksavel> so I tried the original again (from the easy linux howto) and nothing changed
[12:24] <niksavel> leading me to believe that the problem might be outside fstab
[12:24] <shivanee> yo all :)
[12:24] <HellioN-> :,
[12:24] <niksavel> but this is a pretty solid hdd in a laptop with a ntfs/fat32/ext3 partition

[12:25] <shivanee> am quite lost with this command prompt :)
[12:26] <HellioN-> lolz

[12:26] <shivanee> got it installed a in a breeze
[12:26] <soundray> shivanee: but check out ubotu:
[12:26] <soundray> !cli | shivanee
[12:26] <ubotu> shivanee: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[12:26] <soundray> shivanee: those BasicCommands are useful
[12:27] <Arastoo> can any one pleaz tell me wats lvl 3 switch ,
[12:27] <shivanee> from the command prompt, I need 2 know the right commands
[12:27] <Arastoo> soundray i double clicked it , the sitis not opening
[12:27] <niksavel> frogzoo: does any of that helpo shed some light on the problem?
[12:28] <soundray> Arastoo: you've got to show some initiative. I told you what was wrong. Here's the URL again: http://www.dmsa.unipd.it/andreap/nag/nag.html
[12:28] <niksavel> frogzoo: it's been quite annoying loosing a month's worth of mp3s, a handy collection of wallpapers I spent a whole day on and now even some work documents...
[12:28] <shivanee> is the ubuntu regular having a GUI, soundray

[12:29] <neno> How do you uninstall a program?
[12:29] <HellioN-> sudo apt-get remove
[12:29] <SeyToN> apt-get remove programnamme
[12:29] <soundray> shivanee: download the Desktop CD.
[12:29] <lupine_85> neno: in synaptic, or adept, or using apt-get - assuming you installed it using one of the three
[12:30] <wezmurphy> Perhaps its just the sound then  -  if I'm watching a flash video - then fire up GAIM - the flash player halts and loses the sound - it also stops downloading.
[12:30] <shivanee> soundray can u pm me please
[12:30] <neno> i installed it as a .deb file
[12:30] <nicola> it's a flash issue
[12:30] <wezmurphy> Thanks Nicola.
[12:30] <Arastoo> can any one pleaz tell me wats lvl 3 switch
[12:30] <HellioN-> I have gaim running all the time & never have A problem like that.

[12:30] <BlackJack> anybody can tell me, how to completly remove xubuntu? My problem: when I run apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop it only deinstalles the metapackage and not the whole xubuntu
[12:30] <nicola> get this
[12:30] <niksavel> frogzoo: okay...   you think that might have been the cause of all the trouble?
[12:31] <soundray> shivanee: no, I have to go now.

[12:32] <nicola> the other one
[12:32] <frogzoo> shivanee: see install from ubotu above
[12:32] <wezmurphy> Nicola -> I though my ubuntu came with Flash v.9
[12:32] <nicola> then you replace that file (libflashplayr.so) in the firefox plugin directory
[12:32] <frogzoo> wezmurphy: you have to install flash 9, it's not there by default
[12:32] <niksavel> frogzoo: I did sudo mount -a...  I think that's the equivalent, no?  And it works...   but will it work in 30 minutes, I guess I'll see :)   thanks for your time and help
[12:32] <nicola> well, supposing you're using firefox, type about:config
[12:33] <nicola> and you'll discover the plugin version
[12:33] <shivanee> tonyyarusso got it installed and could login, am interested in knowing how to configure the system and also setup the servers
[12:33] <nicola> ehm

[12:34] <kenThomson> i got a 160GB Seagate barracuda, and i want to setup Ubuntu on it! Can someone tell me how to partition most effectively
[12:34] <tonyyarusso> shivanee: You might start with the Ubuntu Server Guide, at https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/index.html or https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/pdf/ubuntu/C/serverguide.pdf
[12:34] <kenThomson> please note that 1GB of Swap will be on HDD-2. HDD-2 also contains WindowsXP
[12:34] <wezmurphy> Its definately version 9.  But about:config in FF doesn't show anything containing "flash" || "macromedia"
[12:35] <wezmurphy> got it.
[12:35] <hjmills> kenThomson: if you are just using it for general use I would recommend a 40gb / partition and the rest for /home
[12:35] <Arastoo> frogzoo: can you plz tell me wat lvl 3 switch is
[12:35] <kenThomson> hjmills: Root is mainly for programs right?
[12:35] <kenThomson> hjmills: How much space do those require?
[12:36] <kenThomson> hjmills: I will be installing programs for Designing (2d animation, 3d animation, vector-pixel based graphic software, audio editing etc)
[12:36] <frogzoo> Arastoo: it's like a smart hub, that can run separate vlans, but not route between them
[12:36] <hjmills> kenThomson: yeah - root is for programs and stuff and on linux there are many more shared libraries than on windows so the programs tend to be much smaller - you will be fine with 40gb i would think
[12:36] <frogzoo> Arastoo: google switch + 802.1q
[12:37] <kenThomson> hjmills: i think 40gb is too large
[12:37] <kenThomson> hjmills: Don't you think so?
[12:37] <kenThomson> hjmills: I mean 40gb of programs!!?
[12:37] <hjmills> kenThomson: the thing that will take the space is the rendering files as they will be large so you may need the space for /tmp unless you render stuff in /home
[12:37] <Arastoo> ok
[12:37] <hjmills> kenThomson: that also includes themes and graphics for those programs etc
[12:37] <livingdaylight> does anyone know whether Evolution is a piece of crap whenit comes to newsgroups. Seems i can't post new messages but only reply, but even then they don't all make it!

[12:38] <kenThomson> hjmills: i have noticed that data expands to fill all space available, so mac space for /home is a top priority
[12:38] <HellioN-> My / is 20Gb.
[12:39] <hjmills> kenThomson: I would go for 20 as base ubuntu takes about 8 i think
[12:39] <Arastoo> soundray: can wrt45gl solve my problem,
[12:39] <hjmills> HellioN-: how much do you have installed and do you have enough left?
[12:39] <lepousson> hi all
[12:39] <kenThomson> wezmurphy: HellioN: What do you guys recommend for root? i need programs for Designing (2d animation, 3d animation, vector-pixel based graphic software, audio editing etc)
[12:39] <tonyyarusso> hjmills: A default install off the disks with no additional programs or files is under 3 GB.
[12:39] <nicola> what's the difference between editing "/etc/samba/smb.conf" or "/usr/share/samba/smb.conf" ?
[12:39] <jokoon> GB not Gb
[12:39] <jokoon> You don't have 20 Game Boys
[12:39] <Arastoo> soundray is not even there
[12:39] <kenThomson> hjmills: would you say <20gb for / is not enough
[12:40] <livingdaylight> does anyone know whether Evolution is a piece of crap whenit comes to newsgroups. Seems i can't post new messages but only reply, but even then they don't all make it!
[12:40] <hjmills> tonyyarusso: oh - where the hell did I get 8 gb from then?
[12:40] <lepousson> anyone has ever tried to set up a dvb-t tv tuner under ubuntu 6.10 ? if yes please help me because i can't get mine working
[12:40] <Vorbote> nicola: /usr/share/samba/smb.conf is an example file
[12:40] <HellioN-> hjmills, I have about 13 Gb free.
[12:40] <nicola> thanks Vorbote

[12:40] <mefisto__> I installed ubuntu edgy on an old pc, hoping to get some use out of it, but I can't get it to start up without the screen going blank AND not being able to switch to a console (with ctl-alt-F1~F6). Any suggestions as to what I can do to try to fix this?
[12:41] <frogzoo> it really depends what you have on / - 500meg is ample if you have separate /var, /usr, /home, /tmp
[12:41] <hjmills> kenThomson: on my server I have used about 20gb and the same on my laptop accordign to df
[12:41] <frogzoo> !fixres | mefisto__
[12:41] <ubotu> mefisto__: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[12:42] <wezmurphy> 8 gig is fine - put the rest on a /home partition - and you know what - you shouldn't have the only copy of anything on your computer - buy some CDrs and back up you /home
[12:42] <kenThomson> hjmills: i would repeat, Would you say that <20GB for / is not enough? (for designing needs)
[12:42] <hjmills> kenThomson: i would reccommend 20 gb just so you dont find yourself wanting later
[12:42] <wezmurphy> Bear in mind that Ubuntu version X.X will be coming out soon - so you'll probably want to hose the root partition and upgrade to that.
[12:42] <kenThomson> frogzoo: i dont have anything seperate except /home
[12:42] <hjmills> kenThomson: its much easier to add an external hdd for the media rather than having to repartion
[12:42] <mefisto__> ubotu: I can't get a console after the blank screen.
[12:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I can't get a console after the blank screen. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:43] <wezmurphy> It isn't like you write a partition table and its a permanent change - you can reformat everything in a few weeks and do it all again.
[12:43] <kenThomson> wezmurphy: Designing needs, seperate home, what is minimum and max space for /?
[12:44] <frogzoo> kenThomson: then you have to reserve maybe 5gig for /usr & whatver for /var (sizable if you're running a webserver)
[12:44] <hjmills> kenThomson: on my home pc I have an 80gb disk with 2gb swap, 30gb music (to match my zen) and the rest as root but Im only using 12%
[12:44] <kling0n> kenThomson: that depends where you choose to put /var and /tmp
[12:44] <semboy> i am trying to play counter-strike:source i need a older driver , can someone tell me what older driver do i need  (the version) , i installd an newer nvidia driver :( and that wont work for me
[12:44] <kling0n> kenThomson: and /usr of course
[12:44] <frogzoo> kenThomson: also one or two gig for swap
[12:44] <sc4ttrbrain> tonyyarusso: how to configure synaptics? after last update,it become insensitive...?
[12:44] <wezmurphy> TWO partitions - keep it simple - 1 for / and 1 for /home.
[12:44] <tonyyarusso> sc4ttrbrain: Does that page not discuss that?
[12:44] <wezmurphy> Minimum 5GB maximum 100 GB. for /
[12:45] <citek> Can someone help? How do i turn my screen saver off for ubuntu?
[12:45] <HellioN-> I use 2 HDD's, One for / & one for /home
[12:45] <citek> Gnome
[12:45] <wezmurphy> System->Adinistration->screen saver
[12:45] <tonyyarusso> citek: System > Preferences > Screensaver
[12:45] <citek> Not there!
[12:45] <wezmurphy> my bad
[12:45] <wezmurphy> :)
[12:46] <hjmills> while we are talkin about partitions, if i had a seperate partition for /usr and reinstalled would it just pick up all my programs?
[12:46] <kling0n> kenThomson: i'd recommend at least 250 for /var+/tmp and about 120 for / if you put /usr and /home on another partition, you should be fine
[12:46] <wezmurphy> citek -> google the question!
[12:46] <kling0n> kenThomson: hint: man ln
[12:46] <citek> wezmurphy -> I have!
[12:46] <sc4ttrbrain> tonyyarusso: i think its bit old, i dont see its for edgy
[12:47] <kenThomson> wezmurphy: frogzoo: klingOn: hjmills: HellioN: I am having 1gb swap on other HDD, and the rest 160GB is unpartitioned, i need to setup only two partitions on the new HDD (160gb), 1. / and the other 2./home (i dont need other partitions for /var or whatever /tmp). My needs are designing, programs for Designing (2d animation, 3d animation, vector-pixel based graphic software, audio editing etc)
[12:47] <frogzoo> hjmills: except the package mgr won't have a clue what's installed
[12:47] <tonyyarusso> sc4ttrbrain: I wouldn't think it would matter...Xorg configs haven't changed that much.
[12:47] <wezmurphy> Try xscreensaver
[12:47] <wezmurphy> from a command prompt
[12:47] <citek> k
[12:48] <citek> xscreensaver: 06:48:00: already running on display :0.0 (window 0x2200251)

[12:48] <HellioN-> /dev/null   :o
[12:48] <kling0n> kenThomson: I'd make 20-25 gig for / and the rest for /home
[12:48] <semboy> "please boot into runlevel 3 by specifying "3" as kernel boot " what does it mean please boot into runlevel :S
[12:49] <kling0n> kenThomson: that leaves ample space for applications and gives you most of the storage for your data
[12:49] <frogzoo> kenThomson: lvm & raid are also an option, just depends how much fiddling you want to do
[12:49] <kenThomson> please suggest a partitioning scheme for me. And moreover tell me what would i do if i ran out of space for /?
[12:49] <kenThomson> frogzoo: please dont complex matter for me
[12:49] <kling0n> kenThomson: if that happened, parted is your friend.. it will let you resize and move partitions without damaging data
[12:49] <kenThomson> klingOn: i was thinking about <20gb
[12:49] <kling0n> kenThomson: backup is always important
[12:49] <tonyyarusso> kling0n: Only to an extent
[12:50] <kling0n> kenThomson: that is definitely realistic
[12:50] <kling0n> tonyyarusso: yes..
[12:50] <kling0n> tonyyarusso: there are limitations
[12:50] <semboy> "please boot into runlevel 3 by specifying "3" as kernel boot " what does it mean please boot into runlevel , i am trying to download nvidia driver to an older version
[12:50] <sc4ttrbrain> igot this error when running qsynaptics, "Can't access shared memory area. SHMConfig disabled?" howto enable it?
[12:51] <nicola> any help to configure username adn password in samba, to access this pc from windows ? it's visible from win2000 but it asks me the username and password and I don't know how to configure them
[12:51] <HellioN-> Weird, If I use the "take screenshot" command from the menu it only captures one screen.
[12:51] <kling0n> kenThomson, tonyyarusso the best option is to choose a layout that does not make you run out of space :)
[12:51] <Moosejaw> i keep getting this error when i try to install a *.bin that is a java app
[12:51] <kling0n> kenThomson: repartitioning is always messy
[12:51] <kenThomson> klingOn: in my HDD, i am having first a 10GB /, and then the rest 150GB /home, and after that there is no space (picture a gparted window here). Now how would i increase the space of root, in case i need it? (this is a precautionary, hypothetical scenario)

[12:52] <frogzoo> HellioN-: just hit printscreen
[12:52] <sc4ttrbrain> i got this error when running qsynaptics, "Can't access shared memory area. SHMConfig disabled?" howto enable it?
[12:52] <kling0n> kenThomson: parted is best if you have sufficient space free to rewrite the entire partition
[12:53] <kenThomson> klingOn: ya...
[12:53] <HellioN-> frogzoo, lolz, It still only captures one screen.
[12:53] <kenThomson> klingOn: How about this 15gb / rest /home
[12:53] <kling0n> kenThomson: how much space free of the 150 GB?
[12:53] <tonyyarusso> Moosejaw: Try again, with a pastebin URL this time :)
[12:53] <kenThomson> klingOn: All free, drive arrived today, as of now it is unpartitioned
[12:53] <kling0n> kenThomson: it basically depends on the amount/number of packages you want to install
[12:54] <kartikmohta> 15-20GB is enough for rrot i guess
[12:54] <kenThomson> klingOn: I told you i need programs for Designing (2d animation, 3d animation, vector-pixel based graphic software, audio editing etc)
[12:54] <kling0n> kenThomson: if it is purely video and graphics applications, 15GB could do it
[12:54] <Moosejaw> ok...
[12:54] <frogzoo> HellioN-: very odd, you sure?
[12:54] <HellioN-> I can show you the output if you like :>
[12:54] <kling0n> kenThomson: I have multiple desktop environments, office suites, development tools etc... and i use just past 22gig
[12:54] <kenThomson> klingOn: And can you suggest a scenario, when 15gb would be less? (please dont say if you mark all packaged for installation in synaptic that would occur)
[12:54] <frogzoo> HellioN-: you running gnome?
[12:54] <HellioN-> Ja.
[12:55] <frogzoo> HellioN-: edgy?
[12:55] <kling0n> kenThomson: "would be less" ??
[12:55] <kenThomson> klingOn: Meaning the root would fillup. And i would run short of space for applications. Though it is frightning to know that you need 22gb root
[12:55] <frogzoo> HellioN-: check settins in system -> prefs -> keyboard shortcuts -> take screenshot
[12:56] <kling0n> kenThomson: i install and test lots of stuff
[12:56] <Moosejaw> here is the error:
[12:56] <Moosejaw> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36417/
[12:56] <kling0n> kenThomson: plus, I run big database and web applications .. so im probably an off case
[12:56] <kling0n> kenThomson: i'd guess 15 gig could do it for you
[12:57] <HellioN-> Really no options there.
[12:57] <kling0n> kenThomson: I have been running with less than 10 gig total at times
[12:57] <kenThomson> klingOn: Still if you can fillup 22gb of sacred HDD space, with pure software *shrugs* :)
[12:57] <kling0n> kenThomson: I have lots of space :)
[12:57] <HellioN-> lolz, Sorry, I'm also running twin view.
[12:57] <kenThomson> klingOn: So finally for / 15gb or 20gb?
[12:57] <kling0n> kenThomson: but i'd suggest you get a backup solution in place so you have the option of doing a new disk layout at a later time
[12:57] <kling0n> kenThomson: go with 15 :)
[12:58] <Moosejaw> tonyyarusso: did you get that?
[12:58] <Moosejaw> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36417/
[12:58] <kenThomson> klingOn: backup solution is out of question, don't have $$$

[01:25] <kenThomso1> Some of the guys that help me with the partition thing are you still hanging around?
[01:26] <kenThomso1> i need to know whether i need to make my /home partition primary or extended. And what are the reasons for it?
[01:26] <frogzoo> kenThomso1: no difference
[01:26] <HellioN-> comment out "GLcore" & "dri" then change the device driver from "nv" to "nvidia"
[01:26] <Hobbsee> kenThomso1: doesnt matter.  you can only have 4 primary partitions
[01:26] <semboy> Noisemo I want an older version not the newst! , i am sorry if i am behving bad , it's cause i have been here crying for help but no one would listen
[01:27] <kenThomso1> frogzoo: I am having windows, ubuntu and if i make /home too primary than, i would only have one primary partition left
[01:27] <Arastoo> can any one plz tell me what should i buy
[01:27] <kenThomso1> does making a partition extended have some of its own disadvantages?
[01:27] <Arastoo> for God sake
[01:27] <Arastoo> wrt54gl is not my need
[01:27] <noiesmo> semboy, the envy installer picks the driver to suite your card thats all i was saying its a neat installer
[01:27] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: For God's sake
[01:28] <Arastoo> ok ok

[01:28] <kenThomso1> 
[01:28] <Arastoo> now should i ask iwill
[01:28] <semboy> noisemo , wait are you saing this is an auto isntaller
[01:28] <kenThomso1> ?
[01:28] <Arastoo> i need to allow internet access to 4-8 different comp on four different networks how could i do that what hardware do i need ??
[01:28] <semboy> noisemo , installer?
[01:29] <ajopaul> crimsun: i have two sound cards how do i disable one? or make one of the default! ?
[01:29] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: do the networks have a server?
[01:29] <frogzoo> kenThomso1: best plan usually is to make 3 primary part'ns & make the 4th an extended, so you;ve as many part'ns as you need
[01:29] <Arastoo> 2 of them
[01:29] <semboy> noisemo , can you please give me the right link , so i cna find the older nvidia drivers thorugh envy
[01:29] <kenThomso1> frogzoo: So for now, i make the /home primary right?
[01:29] <noiesmo> semboy, check the link , yes the installer or envy downloads the right driver to suite your card then installs it can edits xorg file

[01:30] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: So those 2 computers are already on internet right?
[01:30] <semboy> noisemo , i dont see the older drivers :(
[01:30] <noiesmo> semboy, doesn't matter
[01:30] <[GuS] > Bonjour...
[01:31] <pwagland> Is this a good place to raise that, or should I just raise a bug on Malone?
[01:31] <pwagland> Is this a good place to raise that, or should I just raise a bug on Malone?
[01:31] <pwagland> Hi all, I  have just found a bug in the feisty evolution-exchange package.
[01:31] <pwagland> Is this a good place to raise that, or should I just raise a bug on Malone?
[01:31] <kraut> moin
[01:31] <semboy> Noiesmo WELL IT DOES matter , cause i want the older version
[01:31] <kenThomso1> pwagland: please dont flood the channel
[01:31] <pwagland> Sorry... stupid chant client is borked...
[01:31] <Arastoo> nope i whold network in on the net  and i dont like that
[01:31] <noiesmo> semboy, not to me
[01:31] <HellioN-> It says on the front page that it detects legacy/non legacy & automatically gets the drivers....
[01:31] <Arastoo> nope one whole network is on the net
[01:31] <bimberi> pwagland: malone
[01:32] <semboy> noiesmo just makin fun of me :S
[01:32] <noiesmo> semboy, what card do you have what version do you want
[01:32] <pwagland> OK... thanks...
[01:32] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: And the three other networks are not?
[01:32] <noiesmo> semboy, :)
[01:32] <Arastoo> they are not even connected
[01:32] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: You are having four neworks right?
[01:32] <Arastoo> yep
[01:32] <_osh> Anyone who can explain my annoying error? http://pastebin.ca/275303
[01:32] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: and all pcs are on each of them
[01:32] <_osh> It has to do with LVM.
[01:32] <Arastoo> yep
[01:33] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: and only one of the netwrork is on the internet
[01:33] <VSpike> !ati
[01:33] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:33] <Arastoo> yeah amazing you are right
[01:33] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: so the rest of the three networks are they simply LANs or what?
[01:34] <Arastoo> yeah simple lans with oracle server
[01:34] <Arastoo> oracle app server indeed
=== Doodluv is now known as Doodluv_
[01:34] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: configure the server to connect to the internet, and serve you entire LAN
[01:35] <kenThomso1> i typed 'rm -rf /' and guess what happened?
[01:35] <Arastoo> i dont want to server the entire lan , i just want to allow 4-8 clients
[01:35] <HellioN-> :o
[01:35] <semboy> noiesmo i want nvidia driver  NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7167-pkg1.run i want to install this , and i have nvidia driver
[01:35] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: You could put permissions for those 4-5 clients to connect to the net
[01:35] <Hobbsee> kenThomso1: you lost your home directory
[01:36] <kenThomso1> Hobbsee: And everything else
[01:36] <Arastoo> from the software which one??
[01:36] <Hobbsee> kenThomso1: if you were running as root, or using sudo, yes
[01:36] <HellioN-> Arastoo, I'll tell you what you need to buy, A Network administrator.
[01:36] <kenThomso1> hobbsee: i had used sudo 2 min ago, so it was already on the root
[01:36] <noiesmo> semboy, did you install, I caught something earlier about editing your xorg.conf is that correct
[01:36] <kenThomso1> HellioN-: :)
[01:37] <Arastoo> lol, i want to become a network adimim myself
[01:37] <Hobbsee> kenThomso1: you still had to preface it with sudo
[01:37] <Arastoo> even i cant spell it right
[01:37] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: Which os do the client run?
[01:37] <Hobbsee> unless you'd done a sudo -i or sudo -s
[01:37] <kenThomso1> Hobbsee: No
[01:37] <Arastoo> windows
[01:37] <semboy> noiesmo nope i only asked didnt do nothing
[01:37] <Arastoo> even if*
[01:37] <kenThomso1> Hobbsee: i was running as 'su'
[01:37] <noiesmo> so you need driver download
[01:38] <Hobbsee> kenThomso1: which is...stupid.  see !root
[01:38] <Hobbsee> kenThomso1: that's the same as sudo -s or sudo -i
[01:38] <semboy> noiesmo i want driver installd , so i can play cs:source
[01:39] <kenThomso1> Arastoo: so put in a network script that runs in each client as it connects to your LAN. The domain login enables to access LAN. And then when one opens a internet browser, another script is triggered which asks for username/password, upon answering it correctly internet is on!
[01:39] <kenThomso1> Hobbsee: I dont know much about the CLI
[01:39] <noiesmo> semboy, why that version of driver?
[01:39] <kenThomso1> Hobbsee: But that;s what happened
[01:39] <noiesmo> semboy, what nvidia card do you have?
[01:39] <semboy> noiesmo cause it supports opengl
[01:39] <semboy> noiesmo ge force fx 6600
[01:39] <semboy> and 512 ram
[01:40] <HellioN-> All nvida driver suppourt openGL.
[01:40] <Hobbsee> kenThomso1: install ubuntu again then
[01:40] <noiesmo> hmm I have 6600gt video latest drivers work for me semboy
[01:40] <kenThomso1> Hobbsee: am doing it now
[01:40] <kenThomso1> Hobbsee: this is all thanks to live CD
[01:40] <kenThomso1> bye
[01:40] <Arastoo> KenThomso1 and Hellion  can you pleas go on
[01:41] <noiesmo> semboy,  I plays warcraft 3 thru wine and have beryl aiglx set up
[01:41] <Arastoo> Wat:(
[01:41] <stefg> semboy: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config enable : That's all what needs to be done to get nvidia 3D working on ubuntu... no driver downloads or other windows-like stuff :-)
[01:41] <Jaak_> i just rebooted, and now my mysql server fails to start? How can that be?
[01:41] <semboy> noiesmo can you play counter-strike:source
[01:41] <noiesmo> semboy, using latest drivers installed by the envy
[01:41] <semboy> noiesmo can you play counter-strike:source
[01:41] <semboy> i didnt think so
[01:41] <noiesmo> semboy, i havent tried I played battlefield 1942 with cedega
[01:41] <d47> wtf
[01:41] <semboy> wow is easy to play with any computer
[01:42] <Arastoo> Hellion , can you suggest me some nice peace of hardware/router for the purpose
[01:42] <HellioN-> Not really :<
[01:42] <Arastoo> aah
[01:42] <noiesmo> semboy, where can i get  counter-strike:source
[01:42] <semboy> noiesmo that is why , you use cdega
[01:42] <reverseblade> What happens if I install 32-bit ubuntu into a AMD 64 bit machine ?
[01:42] <Arastoo> any one plz help
[01:42] <HellioN-> BOO!!!
[01:42] <reverseblade> does it work ?
[01:42] <d47> yes
[01:42] <d47> you get a 32bit os
[01:42] <semboy> noiesmo but i use wine
[01:42] <stefg> reverseblade: It#ll probably just work :-)
[01:43] <semboy> noiesmo you need to buy counter-strike
[01:43] <reverseblade> stefg, is 64 bit support of ubuntu ok ? is it usable enough for general desktop ?
[01:43] <semboy> noiesmo so are you gonna help me with it :(?
[01:44] <reverseblade> anyone using 64 bit ubuntu here ?
[01:44] <gnomefreak> reverseblade: its fine unless you want nonfree apps like flash
[01:44] <noiesmo> semboy, well I have tried but you seem to believe that latest nvidia drivers will not work so i don't know how i can help if you have the driver the run the installer and install it then edit you xorg file :)
[01:44] <reverseblade> gnomefreak, what about compiling from source code ?
[01:44] <d47> i did use 64bit ubuntu but i reverted to 32 bit for better support
[01:45] <dv_> reverseblade, the flash sourcecode is not available
[01:45] <gnomefreak> reverseblade: the nonfree apps are not built for 64bit so rebuilding isnt gonna make a difference
[01:45] <stefg> reverseblade: the problem isn't ubuntu... 1.) Not much software today is really taking advantage of 64 bit 2.) all the closed source stuff is genrally only available as 32 bit binaries... So get 64 bit if you only need free software. but for convinience and interoperability 32bit is a better choice
[01:45] <kel> I have just installed the new nvidia driver, anyone know how to enable its nVidia's OpenGL implementation?
[01:45] <semboy> noiesmo i just dont get it , i downloaded the run stuff
[01:46] <gnomefreak> kel: change the driver to nvidia in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:46] <reverseblade> I am considering to buy a 64 bit computer, so your conclusion is that I should install ubuntu32 for better support right ?
[01:46] <semboy> noiesmo - NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run i downloaded but now what
[01:46] <d47> kel: run "nvidia-settings" without the quotes into the console
[01:46] <Arastoo> its been more than a week guys, i WANT a solution plz
[01:46] <noiesmo> semboy, open a console and type ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run
[01:46] <noiesmo> semboy, then it should install
[01:46] <d47> reverseblade: well its up to you but thats what i did
[01:46] <gnomefreak> cant open a console you need to drop to tty to run the nvidia run file
[01:47] <stefg> reverseblade: yes. As you became more skilled you can even have a hybrid system. 64bit in general, but 32-bit libs for the CS-stuf
[01:47] <noiesmo> semboy, you may need to use sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run
[01:47] <gnomefreak> and you need sudo to run it
[01:47] <reverseblade> stefg, what about configure make make install procedure. does it remain the same ?
[01:47] <HellioN->  semboy: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config enable : That's all what needs to be done to get nvidia 3D working on ubuntu... no driver downloads or other windows-like stuff :-)
[01:47] <stefg> The Nvidia-9 series drivers break openoffice on my box.. you have been warned
[01:48] <stefg> reverseblade: of course
[01:48] <reverseblade> alright thanks
[01:48] <semboy> okei hellion
[01:48] <semboy> i will try that
[01:48] <Jaak_> how can a mysql suddenly fail to start..?
[01:49] <kel> Umm...
[01:49] <kel> It is indeed using the driver now.
[01:49] <kel> But I wanted the desktop to be draw by OpenGL using the graphic card...
[01:49] <kel> Does that make sense?

[02:00] <monoo> hello, does somebody can tell me how to run mono 1.2.1 on ubuntu 6.10?
[02:00] <stefg> !mono
[02:00] <ubotu> mono: Mono CLI (.NET) runtime. In component main, is optional. Version 1.1.17.1-1ubuntu7 (edgy), package size 1 kB, installed size 24 kB
[02:00] <monoo> when I remove the repository mono, I get many depency errors
[02:01] <derv> stefg: i have not another distr(
[02:01] <GUARDiAN|nb> how can i configure my wireless network (using network-manager on edgy) so that it ignores certain networks?
[02:01] <pwagland> Hi all... So, I went to Mono to report a bug in the evolution-exchange packaging, but it says that evolution exchange bugs are tracked upstream... but in my case it is an ubuntu packaging bug... where do I report that?
[02:01] <stefg> derv: do yourself a favor and get at least Dapper... If you have no broadband access shipit! will send you a CD
[02:01] <jrib> pwagland: bugs.ubuntu.com
[02:02] <ReinH> Ok, stupid question, how do I exit psql?
[02:02] <pwagland> That redirects to launchpad/malone and I get the same problem...
[02:02] <ReinH> woops, wrong channel, but if anyone happens to know...
[02:03] <aegis_> ^C?
[02:03] <aegis_> or ctrl+c was it
[02:03] <stefg> pwagland: /j #ubuntu-motu or #ubuntu-devel
[02:03] <pwagland> Thanks stefg!
[02:03] <jrib> pwagland: what do you mean?  You can report the bug on that package on launchpad, can you link to your previous bug report?
[02:04] <engla> (Ubuntu 5.04 is Hoary)
[02:05] <pwagland> Aha. there seems to be multiple evolution-exchanges on there... I was lookgin at package/evolution-exchagne
[02:05] <pwagland> that is different to distributions/ubunut/evolution-exchange....
[02:05] <engla> first ubuntu I installed
[02:05] <engla> things have changed a lot since then
[02:05] <pwagland> Now I have found the latter and am good to go ;-)
[02:06] <engla> derv: dit you get that? shipit.ubuntu.com can send you a CD by mail
[02:06] <stefg> for free
[02:06] <stefg> so no excuses :-)
[02:06] <monoo> so how do I compile mono 1.2.1 for edgy, or how do I upgrade the repositpory version?
[02:07] <aegis_> dapper can be updated afterwards I think. apt-get dist-upgrade?
[02:07] <stefg> there's rumour, that there are cases where this worked :-)
[02:07] <cardanto1> hey there -- anyone who can answer a quick config question (gnome)
[02:08] <jrib> !ask | cardanto1
[02:08] <ubotu> cardanto1: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:09] <deon> hello
[02:09] <cardanto1> i would like to be able to type in addresses in an "address bar" in the file manager -- can't figure out how to do it -- too much clicking! any thoughts?
[02:09] <stefg> cardanto1: it's a checkbox in the nautilus prefrences dialog
[02:09] <cardanto1> windows has a nice hybrid where i can click when i want and type in address locations as needed -- is this possible in ubuntu?
[02:10] <deon> i got a prob. my dns gets wiped the whole time. everytime it hasppens i have to open the connection sttings and reinsert the ip address. does anyone know what the problem could be?
[02:10] <engla> cardanto1: in edgy, just click the leftmost button
[02:10] <jrib> cardanto1: press ctrl-l if you don't want it to be permanent
[02:10] <jrib> or taht button, yeah
[02:10] <vaibhav> hey all
[02:10] <cardanto1> o.k. so edit --> preferences
[02:10] <engla> cardanto1: no on the adress toolbar
[02:10] <engla> *address
[02:11] <cardanto1> yeah -- i don't see it -- what check box is it? (i did look into this before asking :))
[02:11] <vaibhav> i did apt-get install bootp but when i put bootp it shows bad command
[02:11] <jrib> cardanto1: what version of ubuntu?
[02:11] <derv> engl, aegis__: yes, i know it all. but I should prepare workstations in current of hour
[02:11] <cardanto1> 2.6.15-27-server
[02:11] <jrib> is that dapper?
[02:11] <ProN00b> cardanto1, right klick on the panel and then add to panel, then add a deskbar
[02:12] <cardanto1> yes -- i believe it is dapper
[02:12] <jakob_dk> Hey again im trying to install aMSN v 0.96 on my ubuntu system... but im getting this error: "error: Could not find 'TCL Scripting Language'. Try using the native package manager for Ubuntu 6.10 (apt-get) to install a package with similar name to 'tcl'.  "  - what is TCL??
[02:12] <cardanto1> sorry guys, which panel, i can't get it to work
[02:12] <rukuarti1> Hey, I'm running into a SSH error. I've got a new server bound to the same IP address, and when I connect I get the nasty warning about someone eaves dropping. I could just remove my .ssh/known_hosts but I really don't want to do that.
[02:12] <jrib> cardanto1: ok, so I can't guide you because there may have been some changes.  But there is a gconf setting, type 'gconf-editor' in a terminal while I find the key
[02:12] <rukuarti1> jakob_dk: Its a scripting language
[02:13] <cardanto1> got it
[02:13] <rukuarti1> jakob_dk: try 'sudo apt-get install tcl8.3'
[02:13] <osfameron> is migrating thunderbird from Windows to ubuntu complicated?
[02:13] <cardanto1> config editor is up

[02:13] <vaibhav> anyone for bootp error?
[02:13] <jrib> cardanto1: /apps/nautilus/preferences/always_use_location_entry   do you have this entry?
[02:14] <jakob_dk> rukuarti1: danke :P
[02:14] <cardanto1> looking jrib . . .
[02:14] <rukuarti1> osfameron: It shouldn't be too difficult. You should just be able to copy the directory from C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\something\Thunderbid
[02:14] <cardanto1> yes -- i have it
[02:14] <jrib> cardanto1: ok, check that and it should do what you want
[02:15] <osfameron> rukuarti1: cool, I was hoping it would be something sensible
[02:15] <cardanto1> o.k. so i have swapped out the path bar for a typed in location bar
[02:15] <jrib> cardanto1: personally, I prefer to just press ctrl-l and type when i need to
[02:15] <ChrisBradley> our e-mail server now recieves from gmail and hotmail --- woot \o/ --- Thank you courier! Thank You ubuntu!
[02:15] <cardanto1> let me try that
[02:15] <emacs> does anyone know where's inittab in 6.10 ?
[02:15] <vaibhav> locate inittab
[02:16] <cardanto1> sweet it's there already . . . no restart required (For the program) how is that??
[02:16] <vaibhav> eamacs:
[02:16] <jrib> cardanto1: magic of gconf
[02:16] <vaibhav> /etc/
[02:16] <emacs> well, there's no inittab, most prolly they've changed something
[02:16] <Tomcat_> vaibhav: 6.10 doesn't use init anymore... it uses upstart.
[02:16] <vaibhav> oops
[02:16] <emacs> ok
[02:17] <cardanto1> o.k. jrib -- one more for you: any way to emulate "windows + D" to minimize everything with the click of a button?
[02:17] <vaibhav> Tomcat: bootp error
[02:17] <Tomcat_> vaibhav: Check /etc/event.d ... that should have something you might want.
[02:17] <iceman> hi
[02:17] <vaibhav> ok wait
[02:17] <emacs> thanks
[02:17] <jrib> cardanto1: do you mean you want an icon you can click on?  Or you want a keyboard shortcut?
[02:17] <ProN00b> cardanto1, if you like typing that much, use the console
[02:17] <cardanto1> keyboard

[02:18] <iceman> what is a good alternative to winamp in ubuntu? i have installed xmms and its cool, but isnt there a library like you have in winamp?
[02:18] <cardanto1> pronoob -- no, i like clicking and typing (otherwise i am hitting 'ls' like a mad-man)
[02:18] <engla> cardanto1: ctrl-alt-D should be bound to that already no?
[02:18] <cardanto1> o.k jrib will try
[02:18] <vaibhav> not /etc/event.d
[02:18] <neil_edgy> hello all, how do i disable screen blanking in ubuntu, i understand that after a certain period of inactivity the screen goes blank
[02:18] <stefg> iceman: amarok is the player to beat atm in Linux, even if you use gnome, it's worth the extra kdelibs
[02:19] <deon> hi my dns gets deleted the whole time. does anyone know why?
[02:19] <cardanto1> engla -- yep -- you got it!!! sweet!
[02:19] <iceman> stefg, ok thanks, will try that :)
[02:19] <neil_edgy> hello all, how do i disable screen blanking in ubuntu, i understand that after a certain period of inactivity the screen goes blank
[02:19] <vaibhav> which event.d r u talking about i have several of them
[02:20] <stefg> Bios or Screensaver-settings-applet
[02:20] <vaibhav> am at ubuntu dapper
[02:20] <engla> neil_edgy: look at both Screensaver settings and Power settings in System > Preferences
[02:20] <rukuarti1> osfameron: Not sure.... look on the internet incase I'm wrong.
[02:20] <BlackHawk> hi
[02:20] <neil_edgy> tks engla
[02:20] <engla> vaibhav: for example /etc/event.d/tty1..tty6 run the gettys (what inittab used to do)
[02:21] <vaibhav> no am for bootp error here
[02:21] <vaibhav> :)
[02:21] <vaibhav> i did apt-get install bootp
[02:22] <damageDOne> Hi,
[02:22] <vaibhav> but then its showing bad command whne i pree bootp
[02:22] <Tomcat_> vaibhav: In that case, check the scripts in /etc/init.d
[02:22] <vaibhav> ok wait
[02:23] <vaibhav> which one?
[02:24] <whatspy> anywone has an idea of where the 'osql' package could be found ???
[02:24] <iceman> hmm, when i do apt-get install amarok i get: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ruby1.8/libruby1.8_1.8.4-1ubuntu1.3_i386.deb 404 Not Found
[02:24] <damageDOne> Hi does anyone know how to change keyboard shortcuts that aren't available through System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts? I currently have a shortcut SHIFT + BACKSPACE which logs me out with no confirmation. I can't stand it.
[02:24] <Roq> oioioioi
[02:24] <engla> iceman: that is very strange. Perhaps you have to run "apt-get update" to get the latest repository info
[02:24] <frogzoo> whatspy: apt-cache search osql
[02:25] <cardanto1> is tripwire the best object reconcilation tool?
[02:25] <Tomcat_> vaibhav: I don't know, depends on how bootp works... /etc/init.d/bootp?
[02:25] <iceman> engla, i did that already
[02:25] <vaibhav> no such file
[02:25] <Roq> oioioi!!!

[02:34] <dav085> can someone explain to me what this means
[02:34] <openstandards> Hi, I'm hoping someone can help me with an issue I'm having with openoffice under edgy I've ran oowrite from terminal and this is the output I get back:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36423/
[02:34] <dav085> Create a file called /etc/default/wpasupplicant, add entry ENABLED=0 and save the file
[02:34] <dav085> does that mean i type "mkdir /etc...."
[02:34] <dav085> then what
[02:34] <gnomefreak> dav085: than edit the file to have the ENABLE command in it
[02:35] <dav085> how i do that :S
[02:35] <frogzoo> openstandards: have you tried launching from the menus?
[02:35] <dav085> oh is it a text file that gets created?
[02:35] <QwertyM> my f-spot doesnt open
[02:35] <QwertyM> shows up in tray and vanishe
[02:35] <openstandards> frogzoo,  I have indeed and it was displaying a rather rubbish error dialog box
[02:35] <floating> no if there is a dir /etc/default, then go to that dir and type touch wpasupplicant then type "nano wpasupplicant" paste that line and press enter once for a new line, then ctrl+x and Y for save the file a,d enter
[02:36] <dav085> oh aqlright sweet as
[02:36] <dav085> i get that :)
[02:36] <dav085> thanx floating
[02:36] <floating> maybe "sudo nano wpasupplicant" is better
[02:36] <dav085> yup
[02:37] <frogzoo> openstandards: one option - try moving ~/.openoffice.org2/ somewhere else
[02:37] <cardanto1> hey -- i tried to update (with gksu) but got the following error: A problem occured during the update. This is usually some sort of network problem, please check your network connection and retry.

[02:37] <cardanto1> (what it couldn't fetch)

[02:39] <ski-worklap> anyone else have a problem where, after a sleep/hibernate, gnome can't open new applications?
[02:39] <Allans> i formatted one of my drives in fat32 and im not sure how to mount it...I added it in fstab and try to mount from terminal, but it just keeps saying not found in fstab
[02:39] <ski-worklap> or rather, it can open them , but they don't respond?
[02:40] <Allans> Not sure what it should be called under mount point in fstab
[02:40] <ski-worklap> Allans, try an explicit mount -t vfat /dev/hda# /media/your-mount-point
[02:40] <openstandards> frogzoo, seems like my local openoffice folder was set to the owner of root, so i think i know the problem thanks
[02:40] <Oranabi> hiya people :)
[02:40] <frogzoo> openstandards: cool
[02:42] <Galga> ubuntu 6, internal modem 56k Apache Peripherals driver needed
[02:43] <Allans> ski-worklap:Thanks i got it working =)
[02:43] <floating> dav085: what do you have to ? comment out a line at least is if you type # before the line. dono what hash means
[02:43] <stnz> Last night i installed Ubuntu on my second harddrive, when i tried to reboot, it gave me this error: GRUB loading, stage 1.5, Error 21.

[02:49] <stnz> QwertyM: hmmm.. and that would fix my problem?
[02:49] <stnz> im gettin kinda desperate
[02:49] <J03> because i need to chenge the permissions of a file via terminal, and i onlu know how to do it with FTP :'(
[02:50] <QwertyM> but whats error 21 ?
[02:50] <J03> since i  need to change the permitions of /var/, which is owned by root. But i cant loing with a GUI under root, so i need to do it in terminal
[02:50] <stnz> something like filesystem not found
[02:50] <stnz> i think
[02:50] <stnz> i cant find my HDs for some reason
[02:50] <stnz> so i cant boot
[02:50] <openstandards> starkruzr, wrong partition maybe
[02:51] <jrib> J03: why do you need to change permissions of /var?
[02:51] <QwertyM> gimme your o/p of fdisk -l @ pastebin and then the contents of /boot/grub/grub.conf please :)
[02:51] <J03> Because my Apache deafult directory is in a folder named WWW, which is in VAR.
[02:51] <openstandards> starz, fdisk -l will list the hard drives that should help you a bit
[02:51] <dredhammer> anyone where i can find the latest vlc deb package vlc 0.8.6

[02:52] <stnz> QwertyM: yeah it was

[02:52] <stnz> what parametres do i have to run fdisk with?
[02:53] <jrib> J03: chmod 777 /var/www,  I would recommend setting up a group instead of giving everyone writable permissions
[02:53] <jrib> J03: 777 is what you want right?
[02:53] <J03> yeah
[02:53] <openstandards> starz, check your bios to see if the drive is picked up
[02:53] <J03> Just for /WWW/

[03:14] <Znortfl> earthen, please tell me how :P
[03:14] <earthen> killall X I think should do it
[03:14] <Znortfl> earthen, thanks
[03:15] <earthen> Znortfl, np good luck
[03:15] <dredhammer> jokoon i think it needs the  lesstif library as well
[03:15] <floating> oh heh, well chown Admin makes Admin the owner, then chmod 755 filename  gives only write for Admin
[03:15] <we2by> I fucking hate gedit today :'(
[03:16] <guillem101> we2by, I've always been a NEdit user
[03:16] <gtapsycho> Guys, before I install linux, do I need to have an unallocated partition or just an alredy existing partiton with some filesys?
=== gbutler69_ is now known as gbutler69
[03:16] <Uzziel> hi
[03:16] <guillem101> motif look is ugly, but NEdit is soo good
[03:16] <Uzziel> is it possible to run gdesklets under root?
[03:17] <guillem101> gtapsycho, partition (two of them)
[03:17] <gtapsycho> guillem101 excuse me?
[03:17] <jokoon> dredhammer yes bit I should install xnview first, how can I run a file just named "install" ?
[03:17] <guillem101> gtapsycho, you need one partition for the system (at least) and another for swap (little one)
=== jneves_ is now known as jneves
[03:18] <guillem101> gtapsycho, you might install linux in a filesystem of another OS, but I guess ubuntu does not support that
[03:18] <gtapsycho> guillem101 exactly
[03:18] <earthen> gtapsycho, if you have a unallocated space then ubuntu can set it up with a default configuration but you can also set it up you self ans tell Ubuntu in what way you want to us the partitions
[03:18] <we2by> guillem101, but I can only use gedit to edit over ftp :(
[03:18] <dredhammer> well as far as i know you don't need the install script
[03:18] <jneves> anyone knows where to define  a system default locale?
[03:18] <dredhammer> the bin fils are already there
[03:18] <we2by> and that shit just crashed and I lost 600+ lines of codes
[03:18] <dredhammer> in the bin folder
[03:18] <dredhammer> i stoped using xnview
[03:18] <dredhammer> cause the gui was so ugly
[03:19] <guillem101> we2by, probably. I'm a ssh -CX man :-P
[03:19] <J03> we2by: Gah. Thats Horrible!
[03:19] <dredhammer> although i'd recommend it for windows users
[03:19] <earthen> guillem101, sorry didn't see you were helping him all ready
[03:19] <guillem101> earthen, your help is as worthy as mine :)
[03:19] <gtapsycho> earthen Yeah i understand but now I've all partitions with certain file system. Now how do i create an unallocated one out of them?
[03:20] <guillem101> we2by, I'm pretty sure vi may work through ftp...
[03:20] <jokoon> dredhammer the fact is I don't know another app to read mangas, there are all fine settings I need, is there not equivalent of it ?
[03:20] <earthen> guillem101, LOL yeah but i didn't want to step on anyone toes (so to speak)
[03:20] <dredhammer> try Comix
[03:20] <dredhammer> if they are in zip or rar format
[03:20] <dredhammer> that will read them
[03:21] <we2by> guillem101, I like a gui
[03:21] <dredhammer> if you got a bunch of jpegs
[03:21] <we2by> I'm off to work. :(
[03:21] <dredhammer> try eye of gnome if you are on ubuntu
[03:21] <guillem101> we2by, I know. vi is not for everyone :-)
[03:21] <earthen> gtapsycho, well you will have to move any files you want to keep on the partition you want to use to another partition before you prepare it for ubuntuto
=== rooter is now known as rootpt
[03:22] <gtapsycho> earthen Yeah i'll move somewhere and what do i do then
[03:22] <guillem101> we2by, also, you could try fuse to mount the ftp as a local filesystem and thus use whatever you want to edit the file. Have not tested recently but it is supposed to work pretty easily
[03:22] <earthen> gtapsycho, do you know what format the partition you want to use is in
[03:22] <jokoon> thanks for your help dredhammer :)
[03:22] <dredhammer> no problem
[03:22] <gtapsycho> earthen Yeah, so just a format is what is all required?
[03:22] <ocx32> any nice windows ce irc client?
[03:22] <VSpike> How come in Konversation if you do /list or something which generates a lot of output, it makes the whole desktop unresponsive?
[03:23] <earthen> gtapsycho, if it is in fat or ntfs then ubuntu will have to reformat them
[03:23] <J03> Hey - are there any totem codec packs?
[03:23] <ocx32> i am trying to search for some but no luck
[03:23] <ocx32> ?
[03:23] <ocx32> windows
[03:23] <ocx32> ce clients
[03:23] <ocx32> irc
[03:23] <gtapsycho> earthen Thanks, I'll try your ideas.
[03:24] <we2by> guillem101, I'm doing that with gnome
[03:24] <we2by> not through a shell
[03:24] <semboy> what is the record on this channel , i mean how many people have been the most
[03:24] <we2by> but I'm gonna make backup every time I save myself
[03:25] <we2by> I can't trust gedit any more. it sucks
[03:25] <dredhammer> has znyone been able to compile the latest svn mplayer?
[03:25] <earthen> gtapsycho, well when you are installing you can tell ubuntu to use the unallocated space to install it's self that is the quickest and it does a pretty good job just do let it reformat your intire drive because you'll loose everything
[03:25] <we2by> when time permits me, I'll find a replacement for gedit
[03:25] <dredhammer> *anyone
[03:25] <earthen> gtapsycho, I mean don't let it
[03:25] <gtapsycho> earthen Yes
[03:25] <earthen> gtapsycho, good luck hope it helps
[03:26] <gtapsycho> earthen But because I don't have any such partition I could run it only as a live CD ;)
[03:26] <gtapsycho> earthen Cheers!
[03:26] <earthen> gtapsycho,  do you know what you other Partitions are formatted in?
[03:26] <gtapsycho> earthen You mean my current ones?
[03:27] <earthen> gtapsycho, yes
[03:27] <gtapsycho> earthen All are fat32
[03:27] <VSpike> seems odd... I've seen other programs do that too - apparently hang the system when they are budy
[03:27] <VSpike> busy
[03:27] <VSpike> Skype does it sometimes
[03:27] <earthen> gtapsycho, cool that's the best for Ubuntu it can read write to that easy
[03:27] <VSpike> we2by: try vi?
[03:27] <gtapsycho> earthen So i don't need to change anything?
[03:28] <we2by> VSpike, I can work with vim, but with gedit copy/paste go faster
[03:28] <VSpike> we2by: very true
[03:29] <earthen> gtapsycho, well you'll still need to free a partition for ubuntu  because it doesn't install on fat system but you will be abl;e to read all your other files from ubuntu and write to them partitions as well
[03:29] <VSpike> we2by: I'm using KDE and Kate seems OK
[03:29] <VSpike> we2by: but I've not been using it long
[03:29] <gtapsycho> earthen Well, it's clear now. I asked that only for confirmation.
[03:29] <earthen> gtapsycho, where as if you had NTFS partitions you can only read
[03:29] <jsperlhofer> looking for a dapper-repository for beryl
[03:30] <gtapsycho> earthen I've had enough problems with NTFS.
[03:30] <earthen> gtapsycho, no problem just make sure you knew that thats all
[03:30] <gtapsycho> alright, gtg.
[03:30] <gtapsycho> ta
[03:30] <VSpike> As a newcomer to Linux, if faced with an apparently unresponsive desktop, what sequence of steps would you try to get your system back?
[03:30] <earthen> gtapsycho, yeah me too good luck
[03:32] <QwertyM> VSpike, I'd do a reformat :D
[03:32] <Uzziel> how can i use gedesklets as root?
[03:33] <jvolkman> VSpike, unresponsive all the time, or just right now?
=== arcas is now known as sacra
[03:34] <VSpike> jvojovolkman: No, it's okay now.  But it's happened a few times and I'm wondering what is the linux equivalent of hammering ctrl-alt-del and muttering "f*cking windows piece of .." under your breath
[03:34] <VSpike> so that I know next time
[03:35] <jvolkman> VSpike, I usually keep the system monitor applet on my panel
[03:35] <kmaynard> Uzziel, why use it that way?
[03:35] <sacra> does there exist a LiveCD version of ubuntu that does NOT attempt to find and mount existing filesystems?
[03:35] <b08y> VSpike: just hit Ctrl-ALT-F1
[03:35] <VSpike> jvolkman: I see in KDE i have ctrl-alt-shift-delete, as well as ctrl-alt-shift-pageup and ctrl-alt-shift-pagedown
[03:35] <b08y> and get your system back
[03:36] <conrad__> i am looking for a way to upgrade amarok 1.3.9 to latest version in ubuntu dapper?
[03:36] <b08y> conrad__: what are the needed deps, that dont fit?
[03:36] <b08y> conrad__: if there are things like libc6 , you may be cannot properly
[03:37] <jvolkman> VSpike, I don't recall what the system monitor executable for KDE is
[03:37] <conrad__> g2g quickly i'll talk to you right now
[03:37] <jvolkman> VSpike, you can always drop to a terminal (ctrl-alt-f1) and run 'top'
[03:38] <VSpike> If I hit ctrl-alt-F1 I just get a screen full of pixel trash
[03:38] <dredhammer> has anyone been able to compile the latest svn mplayer?
[03:38] <pilzig> is debian faster than ubuntu if i can configure it?
[03:38] <jvolkman> VSpike, what video card?
[03:38] <VSpike> There should also be ctrl-alt-backspace right?
[03:38] <VSpike> ati radeon
[03:38] <VSpike> x800
[03:38] <Znortfl> Good day people. My X module Nvidia driver mismatches my kernel module nvidia driver. What should I do now?
[03:38] <b08y> VSpike: u edgy?, than i saw that pixeltrah, thats maybe a bug of edgy
[03:39] <VSpike> b08y: yes, edgy
[03:39] <eternal_p> Good morning, can anyone recommend a good RSS news ticker that will appear on the desktop, etc?
[03:39] <jvolkman> VSpike, are you using ATI's drivers, or Xorg's drivers?
[03:39] <VSpike> jvolkman: ATI.  the Xorg ones hang my machine
[03:39] <eternal_p> or an even better question..is there a 'windows sidebar' or 'yahoo widgets' setup available for ubuntu? I find gDesklets is very limited
[03:40] <b08y> conrad__: if there are minor deps, take src and compile yoursekf the news version
[03:40] <Znortfl> Oh come on, surely anybody must know how to let the server module match the kernel module
[03:40] <Znortfl> anybody but me
[03:41] <b08y> eternal_p: whats windows sidebar, link?
[03:41] <VSpike> I seem to remember there used to be some tricks with the scroll lock key hardwired into the kernel.. is that stuff still around?
[03:42] <eternal_p> b08y: same thing as google desktop, etc (for vista) Windows Vista: Windows Sidebar and gadgets
[03:42] <b08y> google desktop, is a desktop search engine
[03:42] <b08y> not comparable to gdesklets
[03:42] <eternal_p> sorry, google sidebar
[03:42] <b08y> or am i wrong?
[03:43] <eternal_p> google desktop is a suite of products, sidebar, indexer, etc
[03:43] <eternal_p> i'm just looking for a sidebar where I can have RSS news feeds, etc
[03:43] <Uzziel> kmaynard> Uzziel, why use it that way? <-- why not, i wanna have gdesklets as root
[03:43] <wuming> is that possible to do xgl on dual monitor?
[03:43] <Uzziel> i dont have a problem beeing root all the time
[03:43] <beasty> sure wuming
[03:44] <beasty> why not ?
[03:44] <wuming> beasty, is there any document about this I can follow,
[03:44] <wuming> beasty, i think there is a limit on screen resolution
[03:44] <kmaynard> Uzziel, because running programs as root, especially GUI stuff, is not always the best idea. i was wondering what you wanted to do, maybe there's a workaround. but, if you just really want to do it, gksu gdesklets
[03:44] <mneptok> Uzziel: you should not ru your machine as root.
[03:44] <mneptok> *run
[03:44] <Subhuman> wuming, there isnt.
=== Khamael is now known as Raphael_
[03:44] <Subhuman> as long as your vid card can handle it.
[03:45] <b08y> eternal_p: hmm, if u want to have, that rss etc, right on the desktop, there is only gdesklets,
[03:45] <Subhuman> because dual head obviously puts a bigger load on the card.
[03:45] <b08y> eternal_p: than i dont know such thing
[03:45] <wuming> Subhuman, I see,,thanks
[03:45] <eternal_p> no worries
[03:45] <Uzziel> when i try to run gksu gdesklets, it says you are not permitted to run gdesklets as root
[03:45] <tuxub> hi, how does gnome find the cdrom devices that appear in "Computer"? is it through /etc/fstab ?
[03:45] <eternal_p> on another note, is anyone here good with bluetooth, I have a PCMCIA Bluetooth card, but Ubuntu only sees it as a serial port?
=== pilzig is now known as strahlemann
[03:46] <b08y> tuxub: yeah, half is fstab
[03:46] <mneptok> Uzziel: that's with good reason. why would you even want to run them as root? just use your user account.
[03:46] <b08y> tuxub: but the other half is gnomevfs
[03:46] <Subhuman> eternal_p, thats because bluetooth connections are handled like serial port connections.
[03:46] <beasty> wuming: i run xgl on a 2560*1024 res
[03:46] <Uzziel> i am logged in as root
[03:46] <kmaynard> Uzziel, ha....is there something you want to do as a regular user that you cant do? or are you running your desktop as root?
[03:46] <kmaynard> oh
[03:46] <mneptok> Uzziel: then don't login as root
[03:46] <wuming> beasty, cool, what video card you have?
[03:46] <kmaynard> well that's not bright
[03:46] <eternal_p> but I cannot do a hditool scan, etc, ubuntu doesn't think it a bluetooth card, so none of the BT utils work
[03:47] <beasty> wuming: nvidia fx 5500
[03:47] <Subhuman> ahh i see.
[03:47] <Uzziel> i hate to use sudo all the times and cannot acces administration as user
[03:47] <Subhuman> eternal_p, does it not show up in hciconfig at all?
[03:47] <Uzziel> so i use desktop as root
[03:47] <tuxub> I have 2 cdrom devices and only 1 of them is visible, and I cannot view the cd contents when I insert a new cd... but I can view both in gnome baker for example for recording
[03:47] <beasty> well that sucks
[03:47] <kmaynard> Uzziel, you can run as a regular user, and then su -  when you want to stay as root
[03:47] <tuxub> is gnomevfs configurable in some way?
[03:47] <mneptok> Uzziel: but the risk of a compromised or broken system easily outweights the sudo inconvenience
[03:47] <eternal_p> subhumanL nope
[03:47] <mneptok> -t
[03:47] <Subhuman> Uzziel, thats really insecure - if you need to use root all the time - open an terminal and type "sudo -i" and just leave it open.
[03:47] <kmaynard> Uzziel, running EVERYTHING as root is dumb.  just fire up the ol' terminal and su -
[03:47] <Uzziel> well its only my homepc, i dont think its that insecure
[03:47] <mneptok> or open a root terminal
[03:48] <Subhuman> eternal_p, how odd
[03:48] <eternal_p> i'll brb
[03:48] <eternal_p> agreed
[03:48] <wuming> beasty:I have a Quadro FX 330/GeForce PCX 5300, should be ok?
[03:48] <mneptok> Uzziel: uhhhh ... most of the world's spam comes from compromised home PCs
[03:48] <VSpike> Oh, I was thinking of sysrq
[03:48] <beasty> wuming: duh ;)
[03:48] <Subhuman> Uzziel, well say i found an xchat/gaim exploit now - now i know your running as root - i could just use the exploit on you and destroy your whole machine
[03:48] <Subhuman> if you were running as a normal user i couldnt.
[03:49] <Uzziel> well its not more insecure then using windows
[03:49] <Subhuman> which is why windows gets so many viruses - most users have total access of the machiner.
[03:49] <kmaynard> if you're running as root all the time it is
[03:49] <VSpike> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_Skinny_Elephants_Is_Utterly_Boring
[03:49] <Subhuman> Uzziel, well why use linux if your going to run it as insecure as windoiws?
[03:49] <beasty> lol i think somthing is missing with this beryl thing
[03:49] <Uzziel> cuz it runs more stable
[03:49] <beasty> and i just found out what
[03:49] <wuming> beasty, I will try it out,,,:),,is this up to date?
[03:49] <beasty> my close button
[03:49] <Subhuman> thats like buying a motorbike and sticking 4 wheels on it....
[03:49] <wuming> beasty: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=127090
[03:49] <mneptok> Uzziel: saying something "is not any less secure than Windows" hardly sets the bar very high
[03:50] <eternal_p> back
[03:50] <beasty> wuming: i got it working since *compiz
[03:50] <kmaynard> lawl
[03:50] <beasty> but now it runs very smooth
[03:50] <eternal_p> Subhuman: if I do a lspcmcia, I get a serial_cs listed, thats it
[03:50] <wuming> beasty, ok,,thx
[03:50] <Uzziel> but without beeing root, i cant access all the administration thingies via desktop
[03:50] <beasty> since the new compiz release
[03:50] <beasty> boehoe
[03:50] <kmaynard> Uzziel, yes you can
[03:50] <eternal_p> the funny thing is, it worked under 6.0, (my frist ubuntu attempt) but I remember I had to type a command before the BT would initalize, I just can't remember what that was
[03:50] <beasty> sudo ...
[03:50] <beasty> xsudo
[03:51] <ThePub> Uzziel: why not?
[03:51] <mneptok> Uzziel: Linux is more stable in large part because of its security. and you are now totally defeating that.
[03:51] <Uzziel> its easier to be root everytime
[03:51] <kmaynard> how hard is it to ypue su -  ?
[03:51] <kmaynard> type
[03:51] <Subhuman> eternal_p, im not sure - ive never really used pcmcia much since my new laptop has ethernet/wifi/bt all built in....
[03:51] <rambo3> thats what happneds when you people post beryl ubuntu videos on youtube you get people like Uzziel here
[03:51] <mneptok> Uzziel: and it's easier to reach my money if i just tape it to my face. but i don't.
[03:51] <drunken-wallaby> anyone here who owns a hp pavilion dv9000 series and has a working! bootline to bypass the buggy bios?
[03:52] <jneves> drunken-wallaby: have you tried acpi=off?
[03:52] <beasty> man gksudo
[03:52] <rusher> hello
[03:52] <ThePub> Uzziel: Being root everytime is like running a normal Windows session.  Whereas in a modern Linux distribution, anything that modifies the system, that is not part of the normal workflow, has a reminder of what is being changed.
[03:53] <ThePub> Then again, Vista promises to fix that.
[03:53] <ThePub> (finally)
[03:53] <kmaynard> ThePub, so did XP
[03:53] <kmaynard> promises promises
[03:54] <ThePub> kmaynard: Vista delivers though :)
[03:54] <kmaynard> ThePub, bah. :)
[03:54] <drunken-wallaby> jneves i've tried most combinations (acpi=off noapic nolapic pnpbios=off biosirq irqpoll,...). nothing works. problem is bad irq7. when the problem occurs, i have to unload the ehci_hcd module and reload it to get usb working (at 1.1 speed only, though)
[03:54] <rusher> vista looked cool
[03:54] <Subhuman> kmaynard, XP was better than 2k for that - it warns you before accessing control panel / C:/Windows - but yes-  it is lame.
[03:54] <rusher> they hada demo in the japanese pc store
[03:54] <ThePub> XP actually had the ability to "run-as" but it wasn't very useful.
[03:54] <rusher> sudo kicks ass!
[03:54] <Subhuman> vistas system requirements though :O
[03:54] <rusher> everyoen should get a amd 64x2 lol
[03:55] <Subhuman> for what? cuz it cant be eyecandy - i can run beryl/xgl from a geforce 4.....
[03:55] <ThePub> Yeah, Vista system requirements are insane :(
[03:55] <rusher> Vista needs dual cores
[03:55] <drunken-wallaby> jneves i can't boot with acpi=off alone. the system hangs at "assume root bridge"
[03:55] <quiet> rusher, no it doesn't
[03:55] <rusher> vista = gnome with gdesklets
[03:56] <quiet> o_O
[03:56] <borg> vista = huh?
[03:56] <axisme> lol
[03:56] <starz> vista is one big fail
[03:56] <starz> its hardghey
[03:56] <quiet> vista is actually not that bad.
[03:56] <borg> i wuv vista
[03:56] <eternal_p> rusher: I have to tell you, I think vista's sidebar is much better than gdesklets
[03:56] <guillem101> Uzziel, I remind that hard drive lost because I was root for an action that didn't need that... and I mispelled the command...snif snif
[03:56] <gast> slm
[03:56] <ThePub> Nah, Vista will 'fail' like Windows2000 :)
[03:56] <rusher> your right eternal_p
[03:56] <kmaynard> let's stay on linux...there's plenty of vista reviews available elsewhere
[03:56] <rusher> true
[03:56] <starz> i'm in the beta testing team and i wont touch it once that thing is out
[03:56] <rusher> god bless ubuntu
[03:56] <starz> agreed.
[03:57] <quiet> "beta testing team"?
[03:57] <borg> ubuntu is filled with voodoo goodness! :P
[03:57] <quiet> lol
[03:57] <starz> although the microsoft entrance to linux will hopefully produce some better drivers
[03:57] <starz> quiet, yeah im legit
[03:57] <quiet> you mean.. you have an MSDN membership
[03:57] <eternal_p> I will agree with g-d bless ubuntu when I get my WPA wireless and Bluetooth working :)

[03:58] <borg> Milky, there's a small commandline program that allows you to execute 32bit apps in 64bit, but i forgot what it's called
[03:58] <ThePub> rusher: man dd
[03:58] <server3> On my Ubuntu was made command: sudo chown g+rw] 
[03:58] <CodeB> anyone here know how to get dsniff to work on windows
[03:59] <Milky> borg: what I'm really looking for is a 32-bit firefox deb
[03:59] <server3> On my Ubuntu was made command: sudo chown g+rw
[03:59] <ThePub> Rejo: I'm guessing that your boot drive is not setup in Grub, but Grub itself has been installed onto the MBR.
=== Damir is now known as Firefox
[04:00] <server3> and now, I trying to sudo, it says: sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0460, should be 0440
[04:00] <Rejo> ThePub: what shoudl i do to fix? (i dont understand your remarks on " your boot drive is not setup in Grub"
[04:00] <server3> Anyone!!
=== badboys is now known as badboyy
[04:00] <server3> On my Ubuntu was made command: sudo chown g+rw
=== Firefox is now known as Internet_Exploer
[04:00] <ThePub> Rejo: Well, it's simple.  Grub is being loaded from the MBR, but whatever configuration it has does not point to a valid operating system.
[04:00] <mneptok> Rejo: you're using SATA or SCSI?
[04:01] <server3> and now, I trying to sudo, it says: sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0460, should be 0440
=== Internet_Exploer is now known as Netscape_Navigat
[04:01] <Rejo> mneptok: i use SATA in this serber, tried before  in other server with IDE
[04:01] <rusher> the tabs in IE 7 looked cool
[04:01] <mneptok> Rejo: you can't move from one machine to the other and boot. what was the drive installed on?
=== Netscape_Navigat is now known as Windows_Vista
[04:02] <Rejo> mneptok: I have tried two different installs on two servers.
[04:02] <Rejo> mneptok: I did not move discs or so
[04:02] <ThePub> server3: I'm not familar with that error.  If it's just a permissions issue the solution would be to solve it in single-user mode.
[04:02] <mneptok> Rejo: ah, ok. and both failed?
=== Windows_Vista is now known as Opera_9
[04:02] <Rejo> mneptok: yep - otherwise I would nbot have asked here :)
[04:02] <lmosher> Where can I find a good sources.list listing for ubuntu? Some of the ones on ubuntuguide don't work (particularly deb http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf edgy-plf)
[04:02] <Rejo> mneptok: 2 different type of hardware (a cheap ass via board and a intel board in a dell
[04:03] <ThePub> server3: maybe someone else has a better idea though.  :)
=== Opera_9 is now known as I_like_IE
[04:03] <Rejo> ThePub: this should be fixable (temporary) from within the grub menu or should i safe mode?
[04:03] <mneptok> Rejo: it could be that the driver for the drive controller(s) are not being loaded into initramfs. check by booting off a live cd what's in the initramfs setup for that feisty install, and add the driver and rebuild initramfs if your driver is not there.
=== dizzie is now known as _dizzie
[04:04] <mneptok> Rejo: and you should be asking this in #ubuntu+1 ;)
[04:04] <julio> alguien espaol

[04:04] <Rejo> mneptok: what is difference?

[04:05] <LordMetroid> Is scanners easy to get going in ubuntu?
[04:06] <rusher> xsane picked mine up automatically
[04:06] <rusher> some scanners work good
[04:06] <LordMetroid> I connected one and nothing happen, maybe I need to restart?
[04:07] <judgen> how do i set the window behavious in beryl?
[04:07] <server3> How to use "single-user" mode? Where it is?
[04:07] <dgold> hello - problems after most recent gnome-updates - the system won't boot beond the splash-screen. It seems there may be a problem with some of the xml-readonly files in gconf - has this behaviour been reported elsewhere?
[04:08] <iratik> Hi! ,  I've got a server running Ubuntu Dapper (RAID10 setup, Not sure if that matters) - We are starting to get problems writing blob data to the disk in MySQL - also, strange things have started to happen with files just getting garbled information in the middle of them - I suspect a disk integrity issue. Can someone point me to a site or guide that shows the basics of periodic maintenance on ubuntu/linux machines with regar
[04:08] <iratik> ds to disk/database integrity?
[04:09] <dredhammer> hello again is there a guide for replacing gstreamer with libxine in totem? i don't want to er run automatix i just want totem to have the xine libs
[04:09] <smithveg> hi
[04:09] <Shozen> Hi
[04:09] <smithveg> someonw know how can i change the png format between png-8 and png-24
[04:09] <iratik> Wow, its nothing but questions in here
[04:09] <ThePub> dredhammer: I'm pretty naive about the audio stuff, but doesn't it already do that if you install everything?
[04:10] <Shozen> Well I have a question too
[04:10] <smithveg> huh!
[04:10] <iratik> smithveg: open up the png file in GIMP and save it as PNG and it should allow you to set the png type when you save
[04:10] <rusher> try gimp smithveg
[04:10] <smithveg> no
[04:10] <ThePub> smithveg: gimp doesn't work for you?
[04:10] <Shozen> How can update firefox from the version that came with Ubuntu to V 2.0?
[04:10] <smithveg> when i save as png, i have no way to choose it
[04:10] <smithveg> it can works. i just want to save an image as png-8
[04:10] <Znortfl> Dear Ubuntu people. I upgraded my nVidia driver and I am not happy with it. any way of installing an older driver?
[04:11] <ThePub> smithveg: yes you do.  PNG-8 is an 8-bit PNG.. you control that with the color palette, not the save option.
[04:11] <dredhammer> totem by itself uses the gstreamer lib so wmv etc isn't in it by default
[04:11] <ThePub> smithveg: open your image and change the color palette to 8-bit, then save as PNG.
[04:11] <Shozen> Newbie here!!!
[04:12] <dredhammer> i'd just like to find a guide to do it without having to use Automatix
[04:12] <dredhammer> to add libxine
[04:12] <gary> Does anyone know how to count files in bash?  I want to do something like ls | and pipe it into a file counter so it counts how many files there are.  Well, unless there is a much easier way?
[04:12] <smithveg> ThePub, huh, can you tell me where the color palette hide..
[04:12] <ThePub> dredhammer: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  ?
[04:12] <QwertyM> when will VLC 0.8.6 come for Ubuntu repos
[04:12] <QwertyM> ?
[04:12] <iratik> smithveg: #gimp
[04:12] <QwertyM> !vlc
[04:12] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[04:13] <Shozen> Umm guys firefox???
[04:13] <iratik> !firefox
[04:13] <ubotu> firefox is the default web-browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion Installing plugins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxPlugins
[04:13] <webben> Does anyone know why the spelling checker used by gedit complains about "shouldn't"
[04:13] <ThePub> smithveg: gimp -> image -> mode
[04:13] <smithveg> Ooopp...ok.
[04:13] <webben> and if there's any way to teach it to understand the use of the apostrophe
[04:13] <QwertyM> Shozen, what Ubuntu are you using ?
[04:13] <Shozen> the latest 6. somthing
[04:13] <ThePub> webben: because it's poor english.
[04:14] <iratik> Anyway - back to why I came here
[04:14] <iratik> Hi! ,  I've got a server running Ubuntu Dapper (RAID10 setup, Not sure if that matters) - We are starting to get problems writing blob data to the disk in MySQL - also, strange things have started to happen with files just getting garbled information in the middle of them - I suspect a disk integrity issue. Can someone point me to a site or guide that shows the basics of periodic maintenance on ubuntu/linux machines with regar
[04:14] <iratik> ds to disk/database integrity?
[04:14] <kmaynard> Shozen, when you use the update manager, if there's a new firefox it'll be updated then
[04:14] <webben> ThePub, only in some contexts.
[04:14] <webben> ThePub: it's certainly not misspelled English.
[04:14] <QwertyM> 6.10 has Firefox 2.0 by default
[04:14] <Shozen> no it is 6.06
[04:14] <dm_> .
=== dm_ is now known as dm__
=== dm__ is now known as _dm_
[04:15] <Shozen> the update is grayed out
[04:15] <smithveg> thepub, i do not know which one should i choose
[04:15] <rusher> 6.06 has 1.5
[04:15] <Shozen> yes and I want to upgrade to 2.0
[04:15] <rusher> download it from source
=== _dm_ is now known as drm_
[04:15] <ThePub> smithveg: "indexed" is 8-bit color.  You can only have a max of 256 color in indexed mode.  I'd suggest buy a book that introduces you do graphic design if you're going to do much of this.  :)
[04:15] <rusher> or the firefox deb installer
[04:16] <Shozen> yeah but it will not override the older version
[04:16] <rusher> uninstall the older version
[04:16] <webben> Does anyone know what spellchecker gedit uses?
[04:16] <smithveg> hehe,,,,,
[04:16] <rusher> http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-2.0&os=linux&lang=en-US
[04:16] <smithveg> okok i try i try , thanks...
[04:16] <iratik> Hi! ,  I've got a server running Ubuntu Dapper (RAID10 setup, Not sure if that matters) - We are starting to get problems writing blob data to the disk in MySQL - also, strange things have started to happen with files just getting garbled information in the middle of them - I suspect a disk integrity issue. Can someone point me to a site or guide that shows the basics of periodic maintenance on ubuntu/linux machines with regar
[04:16] <iratik> ds to disk/database integrity?
[04:17] <Shozen> thing is i am a Mac user and I am a bit lost around how to install stuff here, I get files that have strange things and there is no exe like windows
[04:17] <rusher> run fsck2 or fsck
[04:17] <ThePub> smithveg: but if you have a lot of images to convert, gimp also offers automation features.  IIRC the gimp Web site has a tutorial on how to set them up.
[04:17] <rusher> clean ya disk
[04:17] <rusher> e2fsck
[04:17] <iratik> okay, so what was it? fsck2, fsck, or e2fsck?
[04:17] <rusher> it is linux's scandisk
[04:18] <rusher> fix disk for errors
[04:18] <iratik> but i mean which command was it
[04:18] <rusher> e2fsck
[04:18] <HuibertGill> !ncq
[04:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ncq - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:18] <iratik> do linux disks become fragmented?
[04:18] <rusher> no iratik
[04:18] <rusher> linux fs are all fragmented
[04:19] <rusher> data gets thrown in locations all over the disck
[04:19] <rusher> but stays together
[04:19] <rusher> on windows...
[04:19] <rusher> different parts of files go all over the disk
[04:19] <HuibertGill> HI everybody, has anybody any experience with sata drives and ncq in ubuntu?
[04:19] <finalbeta> rusher, that's not what fragmented means, fragmented relates to files in pieces
[04:19] <wrathchild9> hi
[04:19] <ThePub> all filsystems are "fragmented" and can be "fixed", some are better at dealing with it.
[04:20] <HuibertGill> wrathchild9: hi back again.
[04:20] <Shozen> yeah on the windows you get an exe file that runs the installation here i can't find anything like it
[04:20] <wrathchild9> how I can automatically mount SMB shares?
[04:20] <rusher> edit /etc/fstab
[04:20] <iratik> rusher: in the man files , e2fsck states that 'in general it is not safe to run e2fsck on mountedsystems' with the exception of -n , which would be pointless as it runs the scandisk as 'readonly'
[04:21] <rusher> u need to run it from a live cd
[04:21] <iratik> oh my god
[04:21] <iratik> i mean i've gotta shut down the server?
[04:21] <P2500> Shozen: Use Synaptic for all your installation needs, and when you need to configure stuff, hit the howtos.
[04:21] <ThePub> webben: just out of curiousity.. why spell-check in gedit?   idk what it uses though, probably just the gnu spellcheck library.
[04:21] <Shozen> Yeah great but thing is it doesn't show firefox 2.0
[04:21] <rusher> in the old distros, e2fsck would scan before the system loaded
[04:21] <Shozen> is there a way I can use this app to install the package i downloaded?
[04:21] <Milky> Hi
[04:21] <Milky> skype: error while loading shared libraries: libaudio.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[04:22] <webben> ThePub: because I'm writing in gedit.
[04:22] <wrathchild9> but on fstab what I must write to it?
[04:22] <P2500> Open a terminal, type synaptic.
[04:22] <iratik> Sozen: Have you tried 'apt-get upgrade firefox' ?
[04:22] <webben> ThePub: and regardless of whether I use it or not, it's a clear bug.
[04:22] <rusher> install smbfs first wrathchild9
[04:22] <Shozen> yes but it is grayed out!
[04:22] <rusher> google on mounting smb shares
[04:22] <ThePub> webben: why?  just add it to your dictionary :)
[04:22] <iratik> rusher: So , should i just reboot the server?
[04:23] <rusher> yes
[04:23] <iratik> oh kay
[04:23] <webben> ThePub: that shouldn't be necessary.
[04:23] <webben> ThePub: it's quite ordinary English
[04:23] <Milky> When I run Skype I get: "skype: error while loading shared libraries: libaudio.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
[04:23] <wrathchild9> I have smbfs
[04:23] <ThePub> webben: *shrug* I really do suppose that depends on where you come from.
[04:24] <rusher> wrath: //server/share /mnt/bla smbfs username=bla,password=bla
[04:24] <wrathchild9> thanks, rusher
[04:24] <rusher> hai
[04:24] <rusher> NFS IS SO MUCH BETTER
[04:25] <rusher> i hate samba !
[04:25] <rusher> lol
[04:25] <ThePub> webben: to answer your question, it uses the aspell library for spellcheck.
[04:25] <jakob_dk> Hey again again.. still trying to install aMSN 0.96... the new error when i try to install is: Checking for Tk GUI Toolkit ... failed  :S
[04:25] <Shozen> ok here is a question
[04:25] <rusher> install the dam tk GUI toolkit
[04:25] <kmaynard> Shozen, i can help you get the official firefox package if you want
[04:25] <Shozen> if I download firefox from its site
[04:25] <rusher> sudo dpkg -i firefox.bla
[04:25] <boink> open the tar ball and the binary is there
[04:26] <HuibertGill> has anybody any experience with sata drives and ncq in ubuntu?
[04:26] <wrathchild9> rusher: but I have on PC-s Ubuntu Edgy and WinXP
[04:26] <webben> ThePub: It doesn't really depend where you come from. Contractions are not a spelling error. They may be inappropriate style in some instances.
[04:26] <Shozen> can i install it with the synaptic?
[04:26] <boink> no
[04:26] <kalent> ola
[04:26] <boink> hola
[04:27] <kmaynard> Shozen, no. but it's not hard to get it running. what version of FF are you using now?
[04:27] <synesthesia> Hi, I'm trying to install the server edition of Ubuntu -- I want to just add the desktop component after I've set it up. What's the easiest way to do this (what's the package name for the desktop?)
[04:27] <kmaynard> synesthesia, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[04:27] <boink> why do you want the desktop on a server?
[04:27] <hjmills> what network packet sniffing tools and arp poison routing tools are available on linux - i want to secure my network
[04:27] <Shozen> 1.5
[04:27] <rusher> it is better to learn the console
[04:27] <boink> on ubuntu you mean?
[04:27] <rusher> my server has the GUi and it is slow !
[04:27] <kmaynard> Shozen, ok. put the firefox 2 tarball in /opt
[04:28] <Shozen> I should since I use mac
[04:28] <boink> a server should never have any desktop stuff
[04:28] <synesthesia> I know the console. I have a reason for wanting the desktop.
[04:28] <rusher> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[04:28] <synesthesia> I'm a network admin, I'm switching from Fedora. I just need the name of the desktop component.
[04:28] <rusher> sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[04:28] <kmaynard> Shozen, unpack it there. you will then have a folder called /opt/firefox
[04:28] <synesthesia> rusher: Thanks!
[04:28] <overridden> how do I save installed deps list so I can reinstall them ?
[04:28] <overridden> rebs
[04:28] <overridden> debs
[04:28] <rusher> synaptic has a option in the file menu
[04:28] <ThePub> boink: that's rather naive since X itself is a server process.  :)
[04:29] <boink> it's not naive at all
[04:29] <overridden> isnt there something like dpkg -l > save ?
[04:29] <P2500> synesthesia: Perhaps you can get away with having a lightweight WM and just the tools you need on it to get the job done?
[04:29] <boink> it's just a waste of space
[04:29] <rusher> you can always tar your system
[04:29] <rusher> ll
[04:29] <synesthesia> It's extremely naive to make that blanket statement about the desktop. I run IIS (under protest) but it is GUI based. It's just linux-geek posturing...
[04:29] <DekKeD> anyone knows how to "mount" a video in a webcam device? Sort of "fake webcam" thing
[04:29] <kmaynard> i have a desktop on one of my servers...if you have the juice to run it, who cares
[04:30] <boink> it's not geek posturing. and stop the name calling
[04:30] <ThePub> boink: depends on the goals of your server, no?  X is a server process specifically setup as a remote desktop protocol.  A basic X-Session (like you'd run on a server) takes no more space than any other service.
[04:30] <rusher> Windows Server 2003 is a good example lol
[04:30] <kmaynard> i use nomachine on my server....
[04:30] <synesthesia> I'm not name-calling. I'm just saying that I've heard that blind statement made a lot, and I don't agree with it.
[04:30] <boink> the dekstop is the desktop and the server is the server
[04:30] <rusher> good point boink
[04:31] <boink> if you can't run a server without eye candy, you shoulldn't be running a server
[04:31] <rusher> a server is what you make of it
[04:31] <kmaynard> please tat the flames elsewhere
[04:31] <boink> let's someone else run it
[04:31] <rusher> let Microsoft run it
[04:31] <rusher> lol
[04:31] <semboy> http://bigfile.twistys.com/content/1165858033-9b344a576677ceb228191cc929ecdef1/visual/vid/c/u/cumdtit_544tw_sc01/cumdtit_544tw_sc01_01.mov  i cant play it :S it's says "no video"
[04:31] <semboy> but why :S
[04:31] <kmaynard> if the guy wants to run a desktop on his server, let him. it's not hurting you. argue the merits of it elsewhere
[04:32] <Shozen> okay got firefox 2.0 and extracted the package on the desktop
[04:32] <Shozen> now what?
[04:32] <boink> /var/cache/apt/archives <=
[04:32] <rusher> shozen, should we do this on Gaim?
[04:32] <boink> debs are stored there
[04:32] <synesthesia> I'm not running a desktop, per se. I just need those tools there so if I need an assistant to check something for me, I don't have to instruct them in CLI terms over the phone.
[04:32] <kmaynard> Shozen, move the extracted folder to /opt
[04:32] <Shozen> "Gaim"???
[04:32] <rusher> nevermind, someone is helping you
[04:32] <hjmills> i run a server with a gui and it was a hell of a lot easier to setup than a console based server
[04:32] <boink> go into the directory then "./firefox & "
[04:32] <rusher> good point hjmills
[04:32] <synesthesia> I also do web dev, and it's handy to have a user friendly text editor for all my setup.
[04:33] <synesthesia> hjmills: EXACTLY.
[04:33] <synesthesia> I
[04:33] <rusher> THE IT INDUSTRY WILL RATHER HAVE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE CONOSLE (IE. MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE)
[04:33] <Shozen> would you kill me if I ask where /OP is?
[04:33] <synesthesia> OK. I DO KNOW THE CONSOLE
[04:33] <hjmills> i also found the web interfaces a great help and didnt want to have to make them allow remote connections first
[04:33] <synesthesia> I choose the gui for some tasks.
[04:33] <boink> golly gee
[04:33] <hjmills> oy guys - stop the caps
[04:33] <boink> can we stop this pointless conversation?
[04:33] <rusher> i was just making a statement, not ment twords anyone
[04:33] <boink> this is a help channel
[04:33] <kmaynard> !topic
[04:33] <ubotu> Please read the channel topic whenever you enter, as it contains important information. To view it at any time after joining, simply type /topic
[04:33] <ThePub> boink: like naive statements that you don't run X on a "server" :)
[04:34] <hjmills> boink is right - each to his own
[04:34] <jokoon> Is there some way to connect to my FTP (login and pass) without installing any soft on ubuntu 6.10 ? I tried ftp in terminal and "connect to server" in nautilus but I'm kinda lost
[04:34] <boink> stop it now
[04:34] <P2500> "Hello, I'm P2500, and I'm an Ubuntu addict."
[04:34] <P2500> :-P
[04:34] <rusher> you need a ftp server jokoon
[04:34] <synesthesia> Just out of curiosity, boink, do you work in IT?
[04:34] <semboy> !codec
[04:34] <hjmills> jokoon: the ftp command works as such - ftp <ip address> [enter] 
[04:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about codec - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:34] <semboy> http://bigfile.twistys.com/content/1165858033-9b344a576677ceb228191cc929ecdef1/visual/vid/c/u/cumdtit_544tw_sc01/cumdtit_544tw_sc01_01.mov  i cant play it :S it's says "no video"
[04:34] <atoponce> jokoon: you should be using ssh-server rather than ftp
[04:34] <QwertyM> P2500, :P
[04:34] <victor__> Hola a todos
[04:34] <boink> synestesia: yes, I do.
[04:34] <hjmills> jokoon: then it will ask the username and password
[04:34] <jokoon> rusher I have a remote ftp
[04:34] <boink> now stop this
[04:35] <Shozen> it is telling me that I don't have the permission
[04:35] <rusher> sudo

[04:37] <atoponce> cniryx552: i can try. i know a little
[04:37] <jakob_dk> wuhu got it now...
[04:37] <hjmills> Spaghetti_Knife: yes - to compile you normally change to the source dir, run ./configure, then run make, then run make install
[04:37] <boink> victor__: no hablamos espanol aqui
[04:37] <jokoon> My ftp can be accessed with an address not the same to upload
[04:37] <boink> hay "ubuntu-es"
[04:37] <hjmills> Spaghetti_Knife: instead of running the make install step you run sudo checkinstall to make a deb which gets installed - then you can use synaptic to remove it
[04:38] <VSpike> hmm the "runaway process detector" applet on KDE is a bit useless.  So far during normal operation it has given me warnings about Firefox, Konversation and VMWare as well as several about KSystemGuard.
[04:38] <Spaghetti_Knife> hjmills: Okay, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[04:38] <hjmills> Spaghetti_Knife: do you know how to compile from source and do you know how to use synaptic?
[04:38] <Spaghetti_Knife> hjmills: Nope.
[04:39] <hjmills> Spaghetti_Knife: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/add-applications.html
[04:39] <VSpike> And why the hell is konversation sucking all that CPU anyway?
[04:39] <ThePub> webben: hmm, you probably are right that it's a bug.  you might consider submitting it with aspell.  "shouldn't" is already in the American English dictionary and it is the only contraction that appears to cause a spellcheck error.
[04:39] <hjmills> Spaghetti_Knife: read that - its the official docs on installing, uninstalling and updating programs on ubuntu
[04:39] <Spaghetti_Knife> hjmills: Cool.

[04:47] <ThePub> webben: which of course, "shouldn't't" will be marked as incorrectly spelled, lol.  It appears to only be that word though, which is why I'm with you on the belief that it's a flaw with ASpell.
[04:48] <QwertyM> hjmills, am afraid not!
[04:48] <webben> ThePub: well, I think there's a problem with Aspell /and/ a different problem with gedit. Because otherwise I can't explain the difference between the two.
[04:48] <QwertyM> 5 books = trilogy ?

[04:56] <iratik> Anyway, I'm running a server with Dapper 6.06, I thought I had a virus scanner in there (as part of the ISPConfig setup) it turns out i don't! apparently!? (tried "ps ax | grep clam" and didn't have it running) - i'm abbout to do "apt-get install clamav" however, i need it to not interfere with the existing services and automatically start as the server stars up'
[04:56] <iratik> is there anything i need to know?

[04:58] <Joakim> I have a AC97 sound card
[04:58] <iratik> did you double click the volume icon and set the mixer balance?
[04:58] <Joakim> On my older computer, the both speakers worked

[05:00] <xuser_> Anyone how to disable the ubuntu progress bar during boot?
[05:00] <semboy> can someone tell me , what package i need to play Mov files ??? , please i have done the ubot stuff

[05:01] <iratik> the left slider is the left volume , right slider is the right volume?
[05:01] <Joakim> I get some scrolls
[05:01] <Molly_156> boink: I've already done that, it is installed. I will try the tab autocomplete, Slart.
[05:02] <Joakim> Master, PCM, Line-In, CD, Microphone and PC Speaker
[05:02] <Molly_156> Nope, it's not there. Yet when I do the apt-get install openssh-client, it says it's already installed. This is straight out of p. 31 in the man.

[05:03] <Molly_156> Ah, wait, my bad -- figure it out.
[05:03] <snapple> I guess going the usb route would have to do
[05:04] <Molly_156> I have the client, not the server.
[05:04] <ThePub> snapple: a net install using a kernel image is definitely possible though.  although, I'm not comfortable trying to help someone with it.  :(
[05:04] <Slart> Molly_156: that would explain it =)

[05:08] <ThePub> sephirot1: I'm sure someone with an nVidia could have more specific information, but it sounds like you don't have support for xinerama enabled.

[05:10] <Molly_156> Hmmm. Shouldn't SSH be configured to work right out of the box? It says its ok, its default is Port 22, yet I can't access it remotely.
[05:10] <semboy> Slart I CANT play it :S it just gives me no video

[05:16] <nagyv> ThePub: what?
[05:17] <tuxub> my 2 cdrom drives aren't available in nautilus, but are available in gnomebaker for writing
=== hantoo is now known as hantu
[05:17] <tuxub> how can i enable them?
[05:17] <ThePub> nagyv: I told Slart what I meant to tell you :)  look above that a couple lines ;)
[05:17] <jrib> wildchild: why were you looking for python?  What do you want to do?
[05:17] <ThePub> tuxub: have you tried just putting a disk into them?
[05:17] <nagyv> ThePub: whoops, and how can one exit from it?
[05:17] <Slart> nagyv: can not exit? never had that happen to me... anyways.. he could always edit the xorg.conf file directly.. but that's a whole other can of worms  =)
[05:18] <Munksgaard> When i boot Ubuntu 6.06 (i installed from an "Alternate CD" via commandline interface), i get nothing showing up on my screen.
[05:18] <Munksgaard> It even seems like my screen is shut off
[05:18] <nagyv> ThePub: Slart: I mean, we really don't know what to answer to some questions, so it would be better to leave.
=== philipp__ is now known as obstfliege
[05:18] <obstfliege> hallo!
[05:18] <tuxub> ThePub, yes :)... one of them doesnt appear. the other is there but when I put a disc in it does nothing. when I click in it it says: mount: block device /dev/hdd is write-protected, mounting read-only
[05:18] <dabaR_> tuxub: no icon for them on the desktop either?
[05:18] <tuxub> no
[05:19] <Munksgaard> I had the same problem with SUSE once, and the solution included compiling a driver for my graphics card (ATI x600 mobilit)
[05:19] <dabaR_> !icons > tuxub try that...
[05:19] <Munksgaard> But i am having trouble doing the same in ubuntu
[05:19] <tuxub> !icons
[05:19] <ubotu> Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[05:19] <Slart> nagyv: oh.. yes.. that seems like a reasonable thing to do... unfortunately I dont know of a easier configuration... sorry
[05:19] <wildchild> jrib: I thought version ov python was the reason for error code, when I tryed to run "Amarok Shouter" - internet radion so ppls could lusten my radio but looks like version of python isn't the issue (it's allready instaled the newest one)
[05:19] <jrib> wildchild: oh ok
[05:19] <Munksgaard> Now i tried the liveCD for 6.10, and i still get the same blank screen
[05:19] <Joakim> Ok? No one?
[05:19] <Munksgaard> But i get some sound when it boots
[05:19] <wildchild> jrib: do u use shouter :)
[05:20] <jrib> wildchild: nope
[05:20] <neutrinomass> I get 'tun driver not loaded' when trying to use kvpnc ? Any ideas ?
[05:20] <tuxub> dabaR_, I already have it enabled
[05:20] <tuxub> dabaR_, it isnt enabled
[05:21] <Slart> semboy: ok.. the file plays in vlc on my computer.. and I haven't really changed anything in the configuration... just plain vlc
[05:21] <Molly_156> Slart: Any luck with the ssh?
[05:21] <neutrinomass> Aha... all it needed was a 'modprobe tun'
[05:21] <Slart> Molly_156: yes.. I installed it and did a "ssh 127.0.0.1" entered my password and it just worked
[05:22] <Slart> Molly_156: no changes in the configuration... no setup.. no restart..it just worked
[05:22] <neutrinomass> now it fails entirely ...
[05:23] <Molly_156> That works for me, too -- I just can't access it remotely.
[05:23] <Slart> Molly_156: oh.. I'll check again
[05:23] <Molly_156> I'm just using putty, putting in the IP.
[05:23] <jrib> Molly_156: are you behind a router or have a firewall up?
[05:23] <zeroShift_linux> um.. w
[05:24] <Spaghetti_Knife> Any good ftp applications?
[05:24] <Molly_156> I am not behind a router, and do not have a firewall up, unless this server config throws up a firewall automatically
[05:24] <Spaghetti_Knife> I miss filesharing... :.(....(The periods are tears)
[05:24] <Molly_156> Spaghetti_Knife, lol! We will have bittorrent...
[05:24] <karthik> guys...does anyone know how to hide or remove the hard-disk drives shown in the desktop
[05:24] <Molly_156> will=still
[05:25] <karthik> guys...does anyone know how to hide or remove the hard-disk drives shown in the desktop
[05:25] <Spaghetti_Knife> But is there something like LimeWire for Ubuntu?
[05:25] <jamesbrose> lol limewire
[05:25] <jamesbrose> frostwire
[05:25] <Molly_156> Yes. Bittorrent.
[05:25] <strahlemann> http://chris.engelkotzen.net/calledjesusanigger.jpg
[05:25] <jamesbrose> frostwire is better
[05:25] <strahlemann> :)
[05:25] <Spaghetti_Knife> Frostwire?
[05:25] <jamesbrose> Indeed
[05:25] <strahlemann> opensource alternative, Spaghetti_Knife
[05:25] <jamesbrose> ( i think thats what its called )
[05:25] <Molly_156> Bittorrent is better than Limewire anyway.
[05:25] <karthik>  guys...does anyone know how to hide or remove the hard-disk drives shown in the desktop
[05:25] <Spaghetti_Knife> Cool.
[05:25] <jamesbrose> Yep
[05:25] <jamesbrose> go here: http://www.frostwire.com/
[05:26] <jamesbrose> Its free
[05:26] <semboy> what does it mean -> Cannot open /home/semboy/Desktop/ffmpegX.dmg: No application suitable for automatic installation is available for handling this kind of file.

[05:26] <karthik>  guys...does anyone know how to hide or remove the hard-disk drives shown in the desktop
[05:26] <SpacePuppy> semboy: what kind of file is it?
[05:26] <jamesbrose> Download the deb, then install with dpkg -i <filename>
[05:26] <jrib> Molly_156: it might, idk
[05:26] <karthik>  guys...does anyone know how to hide or remove the hard-disk drives shown in the desktop
[05:26] <semboy> spacepuppy it's a player dvd player but much power full then the others like vlc
[05:27] <Molly_156> Hmmm. How to disable...or find a config file.
[05:27] <karthik>  guys...does anyone know how to hide or remove the hard-disk drives shown in the desktop
[05:27] <Molly_156> According to the docs, there are all sorts of recommended packages, but nothing installed by default.
[05:27] <frogzoo> karthik: it's a metacity setting in the config'n editor
[05:27] <neutrinomass> metacity? Is it not nautilus ?
[05:28] <karthik> frogzoo...i m a newbie...tell me clearly the steps
[05:28] <ThePub> karthik: open conf-editor, in appls -> nautilus -> settings -> uncheck "devices something"
[05:28] <semboy> spacepuppy any idia?
[05:28] <kibbled_bits> anybody having trouble with FreeContrib?
[05:28] <jrib> Molly_156: well 'sudo iptables -L' will list the rules you currently have, but I'm not really familiar with iptables
[05:28] <kibbled_bits> when I do a sudo apt-get update, I get a few errors
[05:29] <ThePub> karthik: I take that back, after opening conf-editor expand: apps -> nautilus -> desktop and uncheck "volumes_visible"
[05:29] <rausb0> what is the purpose of lrm-manager?
[05:29] <frogzoo> karthik: system -> confign editor => apps -> nautilus -> desktop -> volumes visible
[05:29] <Slart> Molly_156: it works great here.. I'm ssh'ing back and forward between 2 computers.. without any configurations etc
[05:29] <SpacePuppy> semboy: yes, what is a .dmg file??
[05:29] <Molly_156> I'll check it out. I know enough to see if everything is closed, but not much more.
=== Agrajag_ is now known as Agrajag
[05:30] <Molly_156> Well, that mystery is solved. IPTABLES is not even installed...curious.
[05:30] <ThePub> Molly_156: it isn't by default iirc
[05:30] <jrib> it is...
[05:30] <SpacePuppy> semboy: http://filext.com/detaillist.php?extdetail=DMG
[05:30] <frogzoo> Molly_156: iptables is part of the kernel, it can't be not installed
[05:30] <drcode> hi all
[05:30] <semboy> spacepuppy why ask me xD i want help from you -> but you can read it here-> about the file http://ffmpegx.com/download.html
[05:30] <Molly_156> Slart:Huh -- and you just used the default config?
[05:30] <karthik> HOW to OPEN conf-editor
[05:30] <ThePub> jrib: it is, now that I look, :(
[05:30] <drcode> I have linux and xp , what option do I have to use share?
[05:30] <Molly_156> It says "Perhaps IPTABLES or your kernel needs to be upgraded."
[05:31] <karthik> HOW to OPEN conf-editor
[05:31] <drcode> samba or nfs?
[05:31] <frogzoo> karthik: system -> confign editor => apps -> nautilus -> desktop -> volumes visible
[05:31] <kling0n> karthik: gconf-editor
[05:31] <rausb0> SpacePuppy: .dmg is some strange image format on mac os X
[05:31] <drcode> what is recommanded?
[05:31] <Slart> Molly_156: yes.. first time I connected I got the "you've never connected to this computer before.. bla bla bla warning warning etc.." but after that it worked
[05:31] <nagyv> ThePub: is it possible that breezy's xorg.conf will be good for dapper?
[05:31] <semboy> drcode remove xp it sucks!
[05:31] <drcode> I know
[05:31] <ThePub> drcode: samba is probably the easiest :)
[05:31] <drcode> hmmm
[05:31] <drcode> is there open nfs client for xp?
[05:31] <Molly_156> netfilter is throwing back all sorts of "you're not root" messages to me, though I am using sudo.
[05:31] <SpacePuppy> semboy: why are you downloading Mac osX files? they don't work on ubuntu
[05:31] <Molly_156> Argh...I should have kept Fedora...
[05:31] <jrib> Molly_156: https://www.grc.com/x/portprobe=22   does that say port 22 is open?
[05:31] <drcode> so I can mount my xp drive in linux?
[05:31] <ThePub> drcode: probably, but xp comes with an nfs client
[05:32] <kling0n> nagyv: yes. that is very likely
[05:32] <philmo1> #ubuntu-de

[05:32] <ThePub> drcode: they can even be setup in your fstab iirc
[05:32] <drcode> wwhat I need to say: apt-get install samba?

[05:33] <Molly_156> I don't have a browser.
[05:33] <drcode> by default in ubuntu 6.06 ?
[05:33] <strahlemann> klaus maus
[05:33] <ThePub> drcode: but otherwise, yeah, just install samba
[05:33] <Molly_156> This is that console-only install I was told was the only way to go. ;)
[05:33] <strahlemann> :)
[05:33] <drcode> k
[05:33] <ThePub> drcode: oh, idk about .06 :)  .10 I had to tell it no ;)

[05:33] <Molly_156> Ah, you're right.

[05:33] <rausb0> Molly_156: w3m, links, lynx
[05:34] <Slart> hehe.. grc thinks I'm running windows.. couldn't he just check the browser id string? =)
[05:34] <drcode> in my server I still use 6.06
[05:34] <drcode> it work perfect
[05:34] <gpled> i have an external usb hard drive.  i recently formated it, and now it does not auto mount.  any idea why?
[05:34] <drcode> dont know if I will upgrade
[05:34] <Molly_156> Gah! Server install installs NONE of that.
[05:34] <Molly_156> I don't even have lynx.
[05:34] <silvertip257> I was wondering if there is an application similar to the "My Briefcase" (a.k.a. syncapp on Windows) for Linux
[05:34] <drcode> ThePub:  what use linux to linux?
[05:34] <rausb0> Molly_156: but you can do apt-get install ...?
[05:34] <drcode> is it use nfs or samba?
[05:34] <ThePub> drcode: it really doesn't matter.. you can use samba for linux to linux too.
[05:34] <drcode> if I have 10 linux client
[05:35] <drcode> k

[05:49] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:49] <Slart> karthik: have you installed graphics drivers for your graphics card.. nvidia/Ati or whatever
[05:50] <karthik> yes...through automtrix i installed nvidia driver
[05:51] <Slart> karthik: ok.. I haven't tried using automatix for that.. but it should work... you could always download the latest driver from nvidia's web-site and install that.. see if it makes things better
[05:51] <karthik> ok...slart...i will just hold on
[05:52] <Molly_156> I'm sorry, what do I need to do with route?
[05:53] <rausb0> Molly_156: just enter "route" without parameters in a terminal windows

[05:53] <semboy> i want to know jrib why this comes up!!
[05:54] <semboy> please jrib help me open it
[05:54] <rausb0> jrib: network connection is not present yet

[05:56] <semboy> jrib ohh that should be it .ok thanks
[05:56] <rausb0> Molly_156: i doubt your subnet is 198.876.82.0
[05:57] <Molly_156> I brought the wrath down on me the last time I asked this, but can I not install the desktop version with a LAMP option?
[05:57] <Molly_156> rausb0: Why do you doubht that.
[05:57] <Molly_156> AH!
[05:57] <Molly_156> Type.
[05:57] <Molly_156> it's 198.86.82.0
[05:57] <Molly_156> TypO
[05:57] <fbc> semboy: ubuntu is osx without the artwork.
[05:57] <jrib> Molly_156: no, you can install apache, mysql, php after installation though
[05:57] <wisdom> hey is 6.10 a lot less buggy than 6.06?
[05:57] <rausb0> Molly_156: so you have official (non-private) ip adrresses?
[05:57] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I install JRE 6? I downloaded it, and when I try to open it from my desktop, it doesn't install.
[05:58] <Molly_156> Yes, I do. I'm a network admin.
[05:58] <Molly_156> I'm trying to switch from ISS.
[05:58] <semboy> jrib so there is no file for ubuntu like this -> ffmpeg
[05:58] <wisdom> i downloaded 6.10 but it was a bad version of 6.06 that would fail its install
[05:58] <Molly_156> I had a fedora box working ok, but this (HA!) seemed like a simpler solution.
[05:58] <wisdom> like it was a joke or something
[05:58] <Molly_156> That's IIS. I can't type today.
[05:58] <semboy> jrib i need a package or something that can play mov files
[05:58] <wisdom> i havent tried to download it since
[05:58] <jrib> ubotu: tell semboy about multimedia
[05:58] <rausb0> Molly_156: and it is really a /24 subnet?
[05:59] <captine> anyone good at trouble shooting.  My ubuntu box locks up at boot screen.  the cursor doesnt even flicker for username entry?
[05:59] <Molly_156> what do you mean by /24 subnet?
[05:59] <maverick`-> 255.255.255.0 ....
[05:59] <Molly_156> I have two subnets I control.
[05:59] <wisdom> even when you try to go to a diffrent tty?
[05:59] <rausb0> Molly_156: if you are a network admin you should know both notations...
[05:59] <Spaghetti_Knife> Can somebody help me install JRE 6?
[05:59] <rausb0> Molly_156: this one 255.255.255.0 and /24
[05:59] <wisdom> ctrl-alt-f1 or f2
[05:59] <Molly_156> Well, you know, I don't. I got hired for desktop support, and I'm all they've got for network admin. It's not a perfect world.
[06:00] <Molly_156> I'm just trying to get a little help.
[06:00] <Spaghetti_Knife> Synaptic Package Monitor doesn't list JRE 6, or any versions later than 1.4.
[06:00] <jrib> Spaghetti_Knife: the java in mutliverse will let you use frostwire just fine
[06:00] <Spaghetti_Knife> Multiverse?
[06:00] <jrib> !info sun-java5-bin | Spaghetti_Knife
[06:00] <nagyv> stilly my friend, but closer to the problem! :) probably he have stopped the upgrade, so there are unresolved dependencies. How can we overcome them?
[06:00] <wisdom> yeah i noticed the java error also
[06:00] <ubotu> sun-java5-bin: Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.5.0-08-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 21811 kB, installed size 65084 kB
[06:00] <jrib> ubotu: tell Spaghetti_Knife about multiverse
[06:00] <wisdom> is anyone running 6.10?
[06:00] <rausb0> Molly_156: okay, the /NUMBER notation is just the number of bits set to one in the 255.255.... notation
[06:00] <Molly_156> OK.
[06:01] <rausb0> Molly_156: like 255.255.0.0 is /16
[06:01] <Molly_156> The other servers I have set up all use 255.255.255.0.
[06:01] <Molly_156> I'm using the same setup info I was using on the Fedora box, which worked fine.
[06:01] <rausb0> Molly_156: and what have the other servers set as default gateway?
[06:01] <rambo3> Molly_156, /24 = 2^24 as last adress
[06:02] <Molly_156> The other servers have the same default gateway that I'm using for this machine.

[06:02] <raul> Any pdf creator for linux?
[06:02] <erchache> hi
[06:02] <jrib> raul: open office can export to pdf
[06:03] <Molly_156> Because I don't want to start giving out all my addresses in a public forum. lol. You already see I"m not the Goddess of Networking.
[06:03] <wisdom> does everyon like 6.10 because it is less buggy than 6.06 or do they not like it because it is experimentally buggy? lol
[06:03] <erchache> any trick to install a machine on server mode with a live-cd?
[06:03] <raul> i mean managing existing pdf like adobe
[06:03] <nagyv> how can I solve the dependency problems shown by apt-get check? (just doing breezy2dapper upgrade)

[06:04] <Garito> hi all
[06:04] <Molly_156> This should have been very simple -- setting this up in Fedora was a snap. Does Ubuntu handle these things *so* differently?
[06:05] <rausb0> Molly_156: if you type in: route -n, is the last line this: 0.0.0.0 198.86.x.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0 ?
[06:05] <Garito> a quick question: how can I create a Zope 2.9 instance if I install it from repositories?
[06:06] <Molly_156> rausb0: I dont' have that first 0.0.0.0. Everything else is the same, however.
[06:06] <rausb0> Molly_156: then you still have no default route set
[06:07] <Molly_156> What I have is [my gateway]  0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 and the rest of the things set to 0
[06:07] <Molly_156> Where is that set? I have my DNS servers set in /etc/resolv.conf.\
=== tristan_ is now known as tristan|lunch
[06:07] <rausb0> Molly_156: the gateway must be set in /etc/network/interfaces
[06:08] <Molly_156> It is set there.
[06:08] <rausb0> Molly_156: in the appropriate interface section
[06:08] <Molly_156> I have iface eth0 inet static
[06:08] <erchache> has any way to install a server without X like boot:server old way with a dapper livecd?
[06:08] <Molly_156> My static IP
[06:08] <Molly_156> My netmask
[06:08] <Molly_156> And my gateway
[06:08] <Molly_156> Exactly like it was on the fedora box, and just like it is on my other servers.
[06:09] <Molly_156> So very puzzling...
[06:10] <rausb0> Molly_156: do you have more than one ethernet interface on that machine?
[06:10] <Molly_156> Nope.
[06:10] <rausb0> Molly_156: so its just lo and eth0
[06:10] <Molly_156> Yes.
[06:10] <rausb0> Molly_156: and lo is also set up? 127.0.0.1

[06:12] <Spaghetti_Knife> jrib, Okay, my Software Sources are multiverse-enabled.
[06:12] <Spaghetti_Knife> jrib: How do I download their Java?
[06:12] <rausb0> Molly_156: try this (non-permanent solution): sudo route add default gw "your-gateway-ip"
[06:12] <jrib> ubotu: tell Spaghetti_Knife about java
[06:12] <Spaghetti_Knife> jrib: Synaptic only shows earlier versions of Java.
[06:12] <Spaghetti_Knife> !java
[06:12] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[06:13] <Molly_156> "Network is unreachable"
[06:13] <jrib> Spaghetti_Knife: type this in a terminal please:  apt-cache policy sun-java5-bin
[06:13] <Spaghetti_Knife> jrib Did that.
[06:13] <jrib> Spaghetti_Knife: pastebin the output
[06:14] <Molly_156> I'm going to set it back to dynamic IP and see if I can at least get out.
[06:14] <Spaghetti_Knife> !pastebin
[06:14] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:14] <wisdom> Windows is like a closet where everything is thrown in chaoiticly. Linux is like the obsessive compulsive cleaner who has everything stored and tucked away neatly.
[06:14] <rausb0> Molly_156: then your gatway ip or your subnet setting must be wrong. the gateway has to be an ip adress from the local subnet

[06:15] <Spaghetti_Knife> jrib: How do i paste something from my terminal?
[06:16] <jrib> Spaghetti_Knife: highlight it with your mouse then press middle click to paste in your browser
[06:16] <rausb0> Molly_156: its difficult to say if something is wrong if you are not giving the complete addresses
[06:16] <Spaghetti_Knife> jrib: I'm using a two-button mousepad. What do I do if there's no middleclick?
[06:16] <Zambezi> What does this mean? "Caught Segmentation fault, dumping stack:2 KB" Is it low memory?
[06:16] <fbc> Is there any reason why my laptop will not hibernate after upgrading to edgy from dapper?

[06:17] <fbc> Is there any photo-stitch software for linux???
[06:17] <rajiv_nair> "photo-stitch"??
[06:17] <Molly_156> OK. I'm back to grabbing a dynamic IP, and everything is fine.

[06:29] <rausb0> Molly_156: so it was a typo in /etc/network/interfaces?
[06:29] <Molly_156> I only said thanks for the help, rausb0

[06:31] <flankk> Ubuntu 6.10 is shutting down my PC at random intervals due to ACPI reporting a false temperature.  When I set "acpi=off" in my Grub menu.lst, my keyboard and mouse freezes on GDM.  I have had this problem for months and am ready to leave Ubuntu if it's really this unstable.

[06:31] <Molly_156> rausb0: Yes, it is. I appreciate the help. I have such big gaps in my knowledge of what I do, I just have to learn as I go.
[06:32] <jroes> I'm choosing between PAL-G, NTSC-M, and NTSC-J
[06:32] <jrib> flankk: I read your previous message.  No one probably knows how to help.  I suggest trying the forums and mailing list if you haven't already
[06:32] <flankk> jrib, I have.  Nobody answered.
[06:32] <QwertyM> jroes, I guess its NTSC
[06:34] <QwertyM> Greenland has PAL lol
[06:34] <ronin2> I just switched monitors on my computer.  now using a monitor that can handle 1600x1200 res, but I don't see anything about 1024x768 in screen resolution options.  how do I make ubuntu/xorg/??? detect and configure the new monitor?
[06:35] <LjL> jroes: it's not NTSC-J, so i'm guessing either NTSC-M, whatever that is, or plain NTSC
[06:35] <flankk> I give up.  I simply can't use a buggy os that shuts down my PC randomly and nobody knows how to fix it.

[06:36] <ChrisBradley> to pure trance
[06:37] <sten> I wonder if anyone knows why the fonts looks so blurry in Firefox and in help text in Ubuntu...even if rest of text/font in the GUI looks very good
[06:37] <sten> Firefox in Windows XP looks perfect in comparison

[06:37] <hjmills> sten, are you using a tft? its prob the anti aliasing settings
[06:37] <sten> hjmills, an LCD monitor yes
[06:38] <J03> Ive just realised that the internet in Linux is a lot faster than windows!
[06:38] <sten> hjmills, I tried in fonts settings, nothing helps
[06:38] <ChrisBradley> JO3.....No kidding
[06:38] <hjmills> sten, fonts will do the desktop - i think there are a few forum posts about a .fonts file for you to put in your home dir
[06:38] <fbc> rajiv_nair: Found a pandora a plugin for gimp to generate panoramic views

[06:42] <semboy> rajiv_nair is there a way to remove the files -> sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20061022-0.0_i386.deb
[06:42] <ivoks> semboy: there is no package for kubuntu
[06:42] <Dasnipa] [> ThePub, haha nah, im a software guy... but still you would not imagine how many people blame software for shorts in connectivity
[06:42] <J03> Are there any Plugin Packs for Totem Player?
[06:42] <ronin2> not sure who asked the bot to answer my xorg question, but thanks, it worked.
[06:42] <NoonInSF> Sory Noob here. Is it possible that linux can be messing up the internet for my whole network?
[06:43] <ivoks> semboy: all packages for kubuntu are the same as packages for ubuntu - there aren't two, only one set of packages
[06:43] <gnomefreak> semboy: if you installed the .deb try sudo dpkg -r w32....
[06:43] <ThePub> Dasnipa] [: yes, yes I would.  I ran a 2000 line ISP in the 90s.  :)
[06:43] <ivoks> NoonInSF: everything is possible, but that could be result of bad configuration, not because of linux
[06:43] <hjmills> NoonInSF: whats the mess on the network?
[06:43] <NoonInSF> right...right...i just wanted to knowo if this is posssible.....
=== atoponce is now known as Elder_Dvorak
[06:44] <ThePub> NoonInSF: Turn off the machine in question, does the issue go away?  If it does, maybe it's a wiring issue and not a machine issue, as it's less likely to be software than hardware on a local net.
[06:44] <conrad___> what does "could not satisfy depencies - BROKEN CACHE" mean when i try to install a deb package?
[06:44] <semboy> gnomefreak like this ->   sudo dpkg -r w32codecs_20061022-0.0_i386.deb
[06:44] <gnomefreak> semboy: yes
[06:44] <NoonInSF> it appears as though everytime my ubuntu  bux  connects my cable modem decides to log itself ooff
=== Elder_Dvorak is now known as atoponce
[06:45] <briar3os_> Just how does one compile software from source? Or binary?
[06:45] <NoonInSF> it's happeed a few too many times for it to be by chance
[06:45] <gnomefreak> briar3os_ is the package in the repos?
[06:45] <conrad___> what does "could not satisfy depencies - BROKEN CACHE" mean when i try to install a deb package?
[06:45] <rajiv_nair> briar30s_: always read the readme u got with the source
[06:45] <gnomefreak> briar3os_: also depends on the package
[06:45] <ThePub> briar3os_: usually the software in question will have an "INSTALL" or "README" file after you unpack it.   :)
[06:45] <briar3os_> I'm afraid not...
[06:45] <J03> GAH! Where do i get TOTEM Codecs from?
[06:46] <ivoks> NoonInSF: did you setup PPPoE connection on ubuntu, while having it connected to modem in routing mode? :)

[06:46] <gnomefreak> briar3os_: untar it and read the README and INSTALL files
[06:46] <briar3os_> Well, the thing is, I did manage to "install" this particular piece of software...but all it seemed to do is make a "build" folder with some things...
[06:46] <J03> Oh. Then why does it tell me i need a codec to play an MP3?
[06:46] <mnoir> briar3os_: suggest you inquire of the developers of this non-standard package
[06:46] <rajiv_nair> it does
[06:46] <jroes> what's Requested Entity already in use" all about?
[06:46] <gnomefreak> J03: you do
[06:46] <briar3os_> Well, damnit.
[06:46] <jroes> "Requested entity already in use" that is -- coming from X
[06:46] <gnomefreak> J03: what player are you tring to use
[06:47] <J03> Totem.
[06:47] <semboy> gnomefreak i get this error -> dpkg: you must specify packages by their own names, not by quoting the names of the files they come in
[06:47] <ThePub> briar3os_: does this software in question not have an associated package?
[06:47] <gnomefreak> briar3os_: some dont need to be compiles (some have pyscripts install the app)
[06:47] <Dheeraj_k> can any body tell me is it unsfe to access net as root? i
[06:47] <ivoks> J03: apt-get install gstreamer0.10-.* would solve all your problems :)
[06:47] <gnomefreak> semboy: try sudo dpkg -r w32codecs
[06:47] <briar3os_> This one did have a pyscript...
[06:47] <rajiv_nair> run that
[06:47] <J03> Thanks :D
[06:47] <ThePub> ivoks: shouldn't feed the bears, someone gave him the codecs link and apparently he can't read :(
[06:48] <ivoks> ThePub: ah... :)
[06:48] <briar3os_> I did, now that I think of it...it did a lot of something, but I still can't figure out how to launch the application... :-X
[06:48] <gnomefreak> briar3os_: well untar it read the 2 files above to see what packages you need to install. install build-essential than ./configure && make && sudo make install
[06:48] <semboy> Gnomefreak so this remove semboy@semboy-desktop:~$ sudo dpkg -r w32codecs

[06:56] <gnomefreak> ty conrad___ brb let me check something
[06:57] <Barr1> Hello, all. My Software Updates has stopped working in Edgy. I launch it, select packages, click Install Updates, and it just sits there. It no longer prompts for my password. At the moment, I've waited more than a half hour when only the gnupg security update was selected. Any ideas?
[06:57] <conrad___> ok
[06:57] <semboy> i have ogle installd
[06:57] <semboy> dragon_76 i have ogle installd
[06:57] <ThePub> cyzie: guess it isn't a text format.  although openoffice calc supports opening and saving in the format.
[06:57] <semboy> dragon_76 now how to open it?
[06:57] <Dragon_76> open Ogle and put in a DVD
[06:57] <cyzie> ThePub, yes, it isnt text format. had tried it
[06:58] <ThePub> cyzie: why do you ask about it?

[06:59] <Barr1> ubox: I haven't tried apt directly, just the GUI.
[06:59] <x-r00t-x> J03, select them all and click "ok"
[06:59] <J03> Ok :D
[06:59] <ubox> do this
[06:59] <gnomefreak> conrad[brb] : your best bet is upgrade to edgy. iirc amarok 1.4.4 wont run on dapper at all

[07:02] <jeff_> no tkaers on pxe diskless booting with root on nfs?
[07:02] <ubox> :)
[07:02] <Barr1> ubox: That listed a bunch of Ign lines, a few Get lines, and a bunch of Hit lines. Fetched 3B in 3S, and then Reading package lists... Done. However, Software Updates is still just spinning with no changes.
[07:03] <J03> Oh, Thats why VLC wouldnt Work!
[07:03] <x-r00t-x> !abousebot | ubox
[07:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about abousebot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:03] <J03> I used to <3 it on windows.
[07:03] <x-r00t-x> J03, yes
[07:03] <ThePub> You know, it's interesting how Galeon displays some aspects correctly while Firefox does not.
[07:03] <J03> Im happy now :P
[07:03] <narvik86> peacekpr: sorry for types, there is a plugin for firefox(media player conenctivity) so you can tell firefox to use mplayer without using mplayer-plugin

[07:04] <jongt> dapper doesnt have built in aiglx?
[07:04] <jongt> support
[07:04] <dmc_> not an expert on this jongt, but I don't think so
[07:04] <patrick_king> does any one know how to set up a mail server
[07:04] <J03> Is xubuntu smaller in file size than its KDE and Gnome Brothers?
[07:04] <ThePub> jongt: don't think so, need edgy for "built-in"
[07:04] <dmc_> I think that was included with Xorg 7.1
[07:04] <AlexC_> jongt: no, aiglx is built into xorg 7.1 - which Dapper only has 7.0
[07:04] <ubox> Barrl:wht do want to install?
[07:04] <boink> patrick_king: it's not difficult
[07:04] <x-r00t-x> jonathaN,  only edgy has it
[07:04] <dmc_> barrl: I've built postfix and sendmail servers on linux
[07:04] <dmc_> what do you want to know?
[07:04] <x-r00t-x> patrick_king, use google . its might help
[07:04] <peacekpr> narvik86, is this a Firefox "Extension?"
[07:05] <boink> !mail
[07:05] <ubotu> mail is another medium to communicate. Ubuntu mailinglists can be found at http://lists.ubuntu.com
[07:05] <boink> hmm
[07:05] <x-r00t-x> lol
[07:05] <narvik86> peacekpr: yes ( http://membres.lycos.fr/sethnakht/ )
[07:05] <ubox> :)
[07:05] <x-r00t-x> please do not play with bot
[07:05] <boink> as a MTA, you would want to use postfix
[07:05] <ubox> :P
[07:05] <boink> it's the easiest to configure
[07:05] <jongt> would anyone know why my 915resolution doesnt work? ive changed /etc/default/915resolution and xorg.conf still with no luck
[07:05] <dmc_> you could try this tutorial:
[07:05] <dmc_> http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/
[07:05] <mseney> using GtKTerm can't figure out what my /dev/TTY? is for accessing my cisco console .. worked fine on my desktop  did a $dmesg | grep tty and it say /dev/TTYS2
[07:05] <Barr1> ubox: There are currently 25 updates available, including the gnupg security update. It's not so much that there's something specific I'm looking for, as I'd like to get the automatic software updater working again.
[07:05] <AlexC_> J03: not sure, probably
[07:06] <J03> Thanks.
[07:06] <jroes> argh.  nvtv is segfaulting on me
[07:06] <dmc_> also google on "ultimate server"
[07:06] <J03> x-r00t-x - I get this error: vlc:
[07:06] <J03>  Depends: libdbus-1-1 but it is not going to be installed
[07:06] <J03>  Depends: wxvlc but it is not going to be installed
[07:06] <patrick_king> dmc_: thats the one im about to follow, but do i need to install the lamp server stuff first
[07:06] <boink> patrick_king: no
[07:07] <x-r00t-x> J03, you dont need VLC . totem is the best :D if you know how to configure it :)
[07:07] <boink> lamp includes php, apache and you don't need that for a mailserver
[07:07] <patrick_king> boink: i want to have a lamp as well as mail server
[07:07] <dmc_> this is also a good link for server building:
[07:07] <dmc_> http://www.howtoforge.com/taxonomy_menu/1/1/50
[07:07] <sysrage> i love lamp
[07:07] <niekie> Anyone familiar with Beryl + Laptop + Edgy? I'm having issues with it =| (It worked this afternoon though)
[07:07] <J03> GAH!
[07:07] <boink> you can install apache,php,mysql later on. why rush things?
[07:07] <sysrage> i love desk
[07:07] <x-r00t-x> boink, who siad?
[07:07] <J03> TOTEM is still not working.
[07:07] <x-r00t-x> huh?
[07:07] <ubox> If u are looking for atomatic updates put apt commands in cron daily
[07:07] <dmc_> niekie: running all those right now on my thinkpad
[07:07] <dmc_> DUMP TOTEM!
[07:07] <J03> do i need to restart?
[07:07] <ubox> or cron monthly
[07:07] <dmc_> man, don't know why that is still the default player
[07:07] <niekie> dmc_, well, my problem is, Beryl crashes almost right after splash.
[07:08] <peacekpr> narvik86, do you know if it will work for Iceweasel?  Is this a safe assumption?
[07:08] <boink> iceweasel? that's debian
[07:08] <patrick_king> boink: thats all i needed to know thanks
[07:08] <x-r00t-x> boink, you are wrong . you cant send mail without mail server and lamp doesnt have mail server included
[07:08] <patrick_king> dmc_:cheers for the link
[07:08] <x-r00t-x> J03, yes .
[07:08] <boink> I didn't say that.
[07:08] <niekie> Video card is ATI Xpress 1100. Driver I'm using is FGLRX.
[07:08] <dmc_> no sweat
[07:08] <boink> yes, you can use mailx and msm. yippee
[07:08] <niekie> Disabled compisite.

[07:08] <amoren> que
[07:08] <amoren> que
[07:08] <dmc_> nieke, what kind of video card do you have?
[07:08] <niekie> dmc_, just said :)
[07:08] <x-r00t-x> boink,  huh ? he want a own mail server . get it ?
[07:08] <amoren> que
[07:09] <Antok> hi!

[07:09] <niekie> amoren, stop that, please.
[07:09] <amoren> que
[07:09] <amoren> que

[07:09] <gnomefreak> semboy: wondows and linux are not the same and you cant compare the 2.
[07:09] <gnomefreak> amoren: stop please
[07:09] <ubox> !amoren
[07:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about amoren - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:09] <AlexC_> amoren: yeah! way to go! now your all grown up.
[07:09] <dmc_> gnomefreak: didn't catch the original comment, but I'd disagree with you on the face of it
[07:09] <narvik86> peacekpr: i never tried it with iceweasel, but imho it can't break anything
[07:09] <dmc_> they are both OS's
[07:09] <semboy> gnomefreak so you are saying windows is better?
[07:09] <semboy> :S
[07:09] <dmc_> comparing cars is fair
[07:09] <x-r00t-x> stop playing with bot please .
[07:09] <dmc_> so is comparing OS's
[07:09] <gnomefreak> semboy: no they are differnet
[07:10] <boink> you should use each OS for its best function
[07:10] <semboy> gnomefreak  so this means it cant play dvds
[07:10] <niekie> dmc_, did you answer me? I accidentally cleared the chatwindow.
[07:10] <gnomefreak> dmc_: window pays for the codecs ubuntu doesnt
[07:10] <gnomefreak> semboy: you can
[07:10] <semboy> gnomefreak i just started linux last night
[07:10] <dmc_> nikie: I didn't get to see your reply
[07:10] <gnomefreak> semboy: no you didnt
[07:10] <dmc_> gnomefreak: that is true,
[07:10] <niekie> dmc_, I said "ATI Xpress 1100"
[07:10] <x-r00t-x> whoever need to install mail server visit : http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=40047
[07:10] <dmc_> however it doesn't mean you can't make comparisons between the two
[07:10] <dmc_> niekie: are you using aiglx or xgl?
[07:10] <niekie> Got FGLRX driver, and disabled composite as a site recommended.
[07:10] <gnomefreak> semboy: i have helped you before also have banned you before
[07:10] <ailean> how can i install an input manager for chinese?
=== conrad[brb]  is now known as conrad__
[07:11] <semboy> gnomefreak why you say no i didnt , i started linux last night
[07:11] <conrad__> thx gnomefreak
[07:11] <gnomefreak> conrad__: yw
[07:11] <niekie> dmc_, was that a bad idea?
[07:11] <boink> ailean: you mean "scim" ?
[07:11] <dmc_> hang on
[07:11] <dmc_> let me check my own xorg.conf
[07:11] <semboy> gnomefreak i rm linux and started last night ?
[07:11] <conrad__> gnomefreak: my friend has amarok 1.4.3 running on dapper, any ideas how i could get that installed?
[07:11] <Antok> the order in the bootup scripts is:checkroot before of lvm, it would be possible run it after of lvm? In addition I would set up swap over lvm too
[07:11] <ailean> boink, yes, that
[07:11] <alex-weej> install edgy
[07:11] <alex-weej> edgy is amazing
[07:11] <boink> just apt-get install scim
[07:11] <gnomefreak> conrad__: look at kubuntu.org for the repos for it
[07:11] <conrad__> ok will do
[07:11] <boink> but do a apt-cache search scim as well, if you need more chinese stuff
[07:12] <semboy> gnomefreak so there is no way in hell that i cant play this cd?
[07:12] <boink> I got scim installed too .. but I still need to learn how to use it :)
[07:12] <mefisto__> does gnome need less system resources than kde?
[07:12] <dmc_> niekie: what output do you get if you just run beryl-manager from the terminal?
[07:12] <boink> mefisto_: both are quite bloated
[07:12] <niekie> dmc_, hmm..
[07:12] <Navyseal> when i type this in the console: navyseal@ubuntu:~$ glxinfo |grep direct rendering
[07:12] <gnomefreak> semboy: i dont have the cd in my hand i cant tell you. try totem-xine see if it plays it
[07:12] <niekie> I'm not on the laptop at the moment, let me get it here :)
[07:12] <gnomefreak> semboy: try mplayer
[07:12] <Navyseal> i get this error: Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"
[07:12] <ailean> got it boink thanks
[07:12] <boink> good luck :)
[07:13] <jonah1980> i'm gonna try feisty on my laptop, when i insert cd the update option should come up automatically shouldn't it? its  not doing though, so how can i update from cd
[07:13] <jonah1980> ?
[07:13] <niekie> dmc_, running Beryl-manager WITH Xgl started, right?
[07:13] <boink> there's a basic scim install how-to as well

[07:13] <ailean> boink, yeah, luckily i don't need to know that :D
[07:13] <boink> yes you do
[07:13] <peacekpr> narvik86, that was an excellent suggestion.  Although it's not embedded media content, it still gets the job done.  Thank you very much.
[07:13] <niekie> XGL Present
[07:13] <boink> scim can crash stuff
[07:13] <ailean> boink, i don't - i'm not going to be using it :)

[07:16] <Navyseal> yes
[07:16] <amitron> Hello, I am having printer problems on Kubuntu Edgy. Is this the place to ask?
[07:16] <patrick_king> dmc_: what should i pick courier-imap  or should i pick the pop packages
[07:16] <x-r00t-x> J03, did you install all of them.(the codec)
[07:16] <gnomefreak> Navyseal: nvidia or ati?
[07:16] <Navyseal> nvidia
[07:16] <x-r00t-x> J03, open terminal
[07:16] <J03> I typed to comand in terminal!
[07:16] <J03> *the command
[07:16] <dmc_> patrick: I use uw-imap, but it was because I inherited that from somebody else
[07:17] <Navyseal> and in xorg.config glx is enabled
[07:17] <dmc_> I would choose imap over pop
[07:17] <gnomefreak> Navyseal: glxinfo  does that say direct rendering yes
[07:17] <Navyseal> :/
[07:17] <dmc_> has more features
[07:17] <J03> shall i try it again?
[07:17] <unimatrix9> something like load glx
[07:17] <dmc_> had to wrestle with uw-imap to get ssl enabled, but did eventually
[07:17] <ubox> Barrl: u wont security updates right?
[07:17] <x-r00t-x> umm there is a one way for beginner. automatix :)
[07:17] <J03> opened.
[07:17] <javaJake> Hello.
[07:17] <J03> Lol.
[07:17] <ubox> on daily basis or weekly or monthly?
[07:17] <J03> Isnt that evil?
[07:17] <Navyseal> gnomefreak don't say yes

[07:18] <x-r00t-x> i mean no its not
[07:18] <gnomefreak> Navyseal: what does it say?
[07:18] <J03> Lol.
[07:18] <Navyseal> just that
[07:18] <javaJake> x-r00t-x: agreed, but everyone else doesn't.
[07:18] <x-r00t-x> J03, its allways works as well for me
[07:18] <jonah1980> hello anyone?
[07:18] <javaJake> Same here
[07:18] <gnomefreak> Navyseal: ca you paste the full output in pastebin
[07:18] <J03> OK. Whats the command to get it?
[07:18] <amitron> I am having printer problems on Kubuntu Edgy. Is this the place to ask?
[07:18] <dmc_> niekie: I would reconfigure your xserver first
[07:18] <x-r00t-x> :D javaJake
[07:18] <boink> sure
[07:18] <boink> !ask
[07:18] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:18] <dmc_> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:18] <Navyseal> ok gnomefreak
[07:18] <Barr1> ubox: Those would be a good start, but I'd rather have the GUI tool working properly.
[07:18] <dmc_> then I would uninstall beryl
[07:18] <x-r00t-x> J03, sudo apt-get install automatix2
[07:18] <niekie> dmc_, allright, doing so.
[07:18] <J03> apt-get install automatix?
[07:18] <J03> OK
[07:19] <Dheeraj_k> hi i just compiled and install latest version of linux kernel but still i am not able to write any thing in ntfs partition :(
[07:19] <niekie> dmc_, uninstall Beryl, and then?
[07:19] <ubox> Barrl:u mean synaptic?
[07:19] <gnomefreak> x-r00t-x: join #automatix for that topic do not suggest people use automatix in here
[07:19] <x-r00t-x> J03, or maybe sudo apt-get install automatix . i am not sure
[07:19] <javaJake> So, I have NetworkManager, and multiple users. Is there a way for all (or possibly some) users to all be able to access the same network passwords so I don't have to configure each user for every new network?
[07:19] <unimatrix9> dont forget the 2 in automatix2
[07:19] <J03> k
[07:19] <amitron> Dheeraj_k, you can't write to NTFS, not in Linux, that is
[07:19] <boink> automatix isn't an ubuntu .deb
[07:19] <dmc_> sudo apt-get remove --purge beryl
[07:19] <J03> Nope.
[07:19] <x-r00t-x> gnomefreak, well i didnt tell you to help him :-S
[07:19] <x-r00t-x> ok
[07:19] <J03> cant find it.

[07:20] <boink> why do you want to send mail through gmail?
[07:20] <Barr1> ubox: No. There is an orange star-like icon in my, uh, system-tray-like place (near my clock) that indicates updates are available. The Software Updates window opens when I click that.
[07:20] <dmc_> niekie: then re-install beryl
[07:20] <kmaynard> automatix is great. use at your own risk, but it's worked for me
[07:20] <niekie> Identifier for video card won't matter and I can just go with Generic Video Card, right?
[07:21] <apokryphos> !worksforme
[07:21] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[07:21] <x-r00t-x> gnomefreak, ok man i wont help anymore :-S
[07:21] <Dheeraj_k> <amitron> : but  some linux users told me that latest kernel has write support for ntfs
[07:21] <ubox> wht is the name of that star like thingy?
[07:21] <J03> x-r00t-x Thanks for trying :D
[07:21] <kmaynard> lol...
[07:21] <rowdy_rac> boink:  I am trying to setup twiki and i am trying to configure it to send emails
[07:21] <unimatrix9> automatix is nonfree your own risk software!
[07:21] <apokryphos> x-r00t-x: read the automatix factoid. There's a good reason for why we specifically recommend against its use
[07:21] <patrick_king> dmc_:
[07:21] <boink> why not use your own mailserver to send out mails then?
[07:21] <javaJake> So, I have NetworkManager, and multiple users. Is there a way for all (or possibly some) users to all be able to access the same network passwords so I don't have to configure each user for every new network?
[07:21] <rowdy_rac> boink: its unable to send thru the perl module
[07:21] <boink> hmm
[07:21] <niekie> dmc_, will do all that, thanks, unfortunately I have dinner first now though. ;)
[07:21] <apokryphos> unimatrix9: I think it is free now actually
[07:22] <dmc_> no problem
[07:22] <unimatrix9> i mean the software you install using it
[07:22] <rowdy_rac> boink: do you know how to setup your own mail server
[07:22] <kmaynard> news flash: almost all software, especially free software, is unguaranteed. use it all at your own risk. anecdotal evidence is just that. bfd.
[07:22] <rowdy_rac> thats all i need
[07:22] <dmc_> there's also scripts for starting xgl we can look at, and also I have a custom script for starting beryl that starts it twice
[07:22] <Barr1> ubox: I hover over it and it says "There are 25 updates available". I click it and the window is titled Software Updates.
[07:22] <boink> yes, I've set up many mailservers
[07:22] <unimatrix9> thats nonfree , as in human right and freedom
[07:22] <dmc_> I will PM them to you
[07:22] <apokryphos> kmaynard: news flash, no it isn't
[07:22] <rowdy_rac> boink: GREAT!!, am so glad i ran into you today
[07:22] <unimatrix9> in software
[07:22] <rowdy_rac> boink: can you please help me set it up
[07:22] <apokryphos> kmaynard: Ubuntu provides official support for things in main
[07:22] <boink> well .. I hope I can guide you in the right way
[07:23] <x-r00t-x> boink, give this link to user who need help with mail server http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/
[07:23] <boink> you just did :)
[07:23] <ubox> barrl: which ubuntu version r u using?
[07:23] <rowdy_rac> boink: any sort of direction is good enough :)
[07:23] <Barr1> Edgy, installed about 10 days ago.
[07:23] <kmaynard> apokryphos, you mean they guarantee it wont mess anything up?
[07:23] <ubox> ok
[07:23] <boink> firstly, do you have a static or dynamic ip-number?
[07:23] <patrick_king> dmc_: after installing the mail server will i be able to send emails with my domain name e.g.  someone@kingfly.co.uk  and will people be able to email me back with that address
[07:24] <Barr1> And, this function worked once or twice before it started failing a few days ago.
[07:24] <Navyseal> gnomefreak -> http://pastebin.ca/275648
[07:24] <javaJake> !networkmanager
[07:24] <ubotu> networkmanager is an application to make (wireless) networking Just Work. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[07:24] <designdream> i have wget in bg and the job keeps displaying that status of the download wherever my cursor is.. how can i silence the output of a job in the bg
[07:24] <ubox> but y do u need security updates for linux?
[07:24] <apokryphos> kmaynard: the guarantee that you'll get official support with it. The actual software/developers don't provide this guarantee, but particular distributions might well.
[07:24] <rowdy_rac> boink: can we chat in a private window..tjere are too many messages on this window
[07:24] <boink> there are, but I will go home soonish
[07:25] <kmaynard> apokryphos, from the GPL: "Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software." maybe i just used the wrong word. it all carries a risk.
[07:25] <kmaynard> support or not
[07:25] <dmc_> patrick: I believe so, as long as the domain is registered.
[07:25] <boink> firstly, you need to start with the MX records
[07:25] <Barr1> ubox: Depends on how you define "need." There are non-security updates provided by this tool, too. At the moment, there are some for gimp and for some games that are not coming down.
[07:25] <unimatrix9> navyseak paste your xorg.conf there so we can take an look
[07:25] <unimatrix9> seal*
[07:25] <javaJake> Aynone!?
[07:25] <rowdy_rac> boink: i have dynamic ip but it stays static as long as I dont reboot, which rarely happens
[07:25] <javaJake> Is there a way for all (or possibly some) users to all be able to access the same network passwords so I don't have to configure each user for every new network?
[07:25] <Navyseal> ok unimatrix9
[07:26] <patrick_king> dmc_:yep my domain is registered
[07:26] <rowdy_rac> boink: I sent a private message to you, did u get it
[07:26] <boink> no
[07:26] <kmaynard> javaJake, network passwords?
[07:26] <javaJake> kmaynard: yea
[07:26] <dmc_> all the servers I have set up have been in a university, but I believe that should work from home too
[07:26] <rajiv_nair> rowdy_rac: u registered??
[07:26] <rowdy_rac> no
[07:26] <dmc_> unless your ISP blocks some ports
[07:26] <apokryphos> kmaynard: the GPL there states the possibility of providing no warranty, not the fact that it's a requirement of free software to be thus.
[07:26] <rowdy_rac> how do u register
[07:26] <kmaynard> javaJake, what does that mean? are you trying to setup a public share or what?
[07:26] <boink> dmc_: you mean setting up a vpn?
[07:26] <ubox> barrl: i don't know the name of the update software u are talking about but can u install it again?
[07:26] <rajiv_nair> "/msg nickserv register <ur passwrd>"
[07:27] <dmc_> I'm not talking about setting up a vpn.
[07:27] <ValMarko> Hello. I'm having problems copying ISO do DVD. I'm using K3b. Is there another program?
[07:27] <dmc_> talking about mail servers

[07:27] <semboy> Gnomefreak okei i just got a new idia , mplayer can play the fbi stuff and the launguge but can go to the movie it stops and show me -> Maybe you don't have enough rights for this, or source doesn't contain data (e.g: no disc in drive). (Error reading from DVD.)
[07:27] <kmaynard> javaJake, just create an account for them. if you have an always on conncetion, they can get on
[07:27] <rowdy_rac> rajiv_nair:  Ok..did that
[07:28] <rajiv_nair> now u can send PM's:)
[07:28] <patrick_king> boink:what are the mx records
[07:28] <Barr1> ubox: I could try, if I knew what it was called either... :-( It's functionality that is instaleld automatically with Ubuntu. My Hoary install had it as well.
[07:28] <javaJake> kmaynard: except NM doesn't connect until you login.
[07:28] <Navyseal> my xorg.conf is -> http://pastebin.ca/275654

[07:28] <kmaynard> apokryphos, never mind then... :) it's enough for me to be right, dont wanna drag it on
[07:28] <gnomefreak> semboy: is it a dvd or a cd that you are trying to play?

[07:28] <alek66> whats the best way to install new nvidia drivers? uninstall the old ones, reboot and try the new ones?
[07:28] <rajiv_nair> rowdy_rac:np:)
[07:28] <boink> patrick_king: you need to know this stuff before you can set up a mailserver
[07:28] <kmaynard> javaJake, wireless?
[07:28] <boink> mx records are part of the dns
[07:28] <rowdy_rac> boink: are u getting my messages now?
[07:28] <semboy> gnomefrak yes i am trying to play dvd , The simpsons"
[07:28] <javaJake> kmaynard: yea
[07:28] <semboy> gnomefrak yes i am trying to play dvd ," The simpsons"*
[07:29] <kmaynard> javaJake, ah... i can't help much there, sorry
[07:29] <axisme> semboy, do any of your other dvds work?
[07:29] <boink> setting up a mailserver is a straight forward process, but you need to know a few things
[07:29] <gnomefreak> semboy: did you install the dvd codecs? like libdvdread and libdvdcss and set the region yet?
[07:29] <semboy> gnomefreak i dont think so
[07:29] <patrick_king> boink:arh now i know what the mx records are
[07:30] <gnomefreak> semboy: please do so.
[07:30] <jroes> I followed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaTVOut but i'm still getting a bunch of weird random colored blocks and stuff on my TV -- anyone know what could be causing this?

[07:30] <jroes> I see tv out when ubuntu loads, but once X is going it stops working
[07:30] <boink> well ... that could be a problem.
[07:30] <javaJake> Is there a way for all (or possibly some) users to all be able to access the same network passwords so I don't have to configure each user for every new network?
[07:30] <rowdy_rac> boink: i also have dyndns account
[07:30] <patrick_king> static
[07:30] <boink> aaah, good
[07:30] <javaJake> OK, let me try a different question
[07:30] <ubox> Barrl: mutiple softwares can be upgraded with spaces
[07:30] <boink> which MTA are you using?
[07:30] <ubox> in between them
[07:30] <javaJake> Is there a way to make NetworkManager use one keyring for all users, instead of making a new one for each new user?
[07:31] <rowdy_rac> boink: postfix
[07:31] <Barr1> ubox: I would have to know the name of the package to upgrade. This tool, when it works, does that automatically.
[07:31] <boink> so, you'll need to fill in the main.conf in /etc/postfix/
=== adml is now known as alindeman
[07:31] <boink> and which MUA are you using?
[07:31] <rowdy_rac> boink: whats MUA
[07:32] <ValMarko> Trying to copy ISO to DVD-R (Sony , with accucore...). I used GnomeBaker and K3b and it gives me always : media is not formatted or unsupported.

[07:32] <pluma> Gah. My native UT2004 installation keeps randomly crashing (usually when I'm about to win) with segfaults. It tells me crash info will be saved to my logfile, but doesn't say which, so I have no idea where to look. Any help here?
[07:32] <unimatrix9> navyseal, it al looks good as far as i can tell
[07:32] <rowdy_rac> boink: i need to only send emails
[07:32] <boink> mua ... fancy word, means mail user agent. like thunderbird, mutt ..

[07:32] <rowdy_rac> boink: thundebird
[07:32] <boink> rowdy_rac: just using /usr/sbin/sendmail ?
[07:32] <javaJake> Is there a way to make NetworkManager use one keyring for all users, instead of making a new one for each new user?
[07:32] <ValMarko> should I buy other brand ?
[07:32] <boink> ok .. just fill in the main.conf in /etc/postix. that's the most important bit
[07:33] <boink> and make sure that with dyndns.org the MX records are filled in
=== adml is now known as alindeman
[07:33] <pluma> I've already lost 5000 credits due to crashes during bloodrites. These segfaults are getting REALLY annoying. It's never done that before.
[07:33] <ubox> !digg
[07:33] <rowdy_rac> boink: what should i put in the main.cf, and what should fill the MX records with?
[07:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about digg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:33] <cello_rasp> is there anything for removing log files or cache files... a program log fills my whole HD
[07:33] <unimatrix9> could some one else take an look at it too

[07:33] <cello_rasp> i dont want to ave to gamble and remove them myself
[07:33] <javaJake> heheh
[07:33] <boink> mx records .. that's where you tell dyndns.org where to send the mail
[07:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about how do I make a new factoid? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[07:34] <boink> then have a good look at the main.cf, just fill it in with your domain name
[07:34] <boink> take a slow look at it, it's easy to fill in
[07:34] <unimatrix9> and the xorg.conf http://pastebin.ca/275654
[07:34] <EnsignRedshirt> Does anyone know of a free tool for converting PDF to Word format?

[07:36] <rajiv_nair> hi
[07:36] <EnsignRedshirt> cello_rasp: Are you sure it can *read* a PDF document?  I just tried to open one in Abiword, and it is showing garbage!
[07:36] <Navyseal> unimatrix9 how you mean?
[07:36] <rowdy_rac> boink: if its just to send emails..why shud we updated the MX records
[07:37] <unimatrix9> it does boot into desktop right?
[07:37] <ubun> you cant remove individual games that come with ubuntu can you? if i want to uninstall like 'nibbles' i have to uninstall all of 'gnome-games'?
[07:37] <amee2k> do development packages for libs always depend on the appropriate runtime package?
[07:37] <boink> if you just want to send out emails, there is no need for mxrecords
[07:37] <rowdy_rac> boink: ok..Am going to try setting it up..will let you know what happens.
[07:37] <boink> good luck
[07:37] <boink> it's kewl running your own mailserver

[07:44] <Richard__> rawr, I'm trying to find out where wine puts all its logfiles (as the console is empty since wine just crashes when trying to run a program)
[07:44] <craigbass1976> I also rebooted to see if that would help, but it doesn't.  How do I get my system to the state it was in before the apt-get install kubuntu-desktop command I foolishly typed?

[08:05] <LjL> edan: what does that mean?
[08:05] <levander> Somebody can point me to some good doc's on apt-get and sources.list?  I'm wanting to only use specified packages from backports, and not have it update everything it has a newer version of than the mainstream repositories.
[08:06] <edan> i have some updates that i dont whant to install in my list
[08:06] <LjL> Airwulf: i don't think you can. you can, however, replace the whole "Applications System Places" stuff with a single icon
[08:06] <edan> and i cant remove them
[08:06] <rajiv_nair> airwulf: i hided that using menu editor
[08:06] <jrib> ubotu: tell levander about pinning

[08:07] <sladen> Airwulf: unhide it with the menu editor!
[08:07] <LjL> edan: which are they? do they all come from a specific repository? why do you want to avoid installing them?
[08:07] <jrib> levander: also, man 5 apt_preferences .  Or you could just install what you want and then disable backports
[08:07] <sladen> Airwulf: or run the commands directly from the command line

[08:08] <edan> thankyou
[08:09] <jroes> I'm trying to get TV out going though, so I was wondering if maybe I needed a different driver
[08:09] <niekie> Hmm.. still experiencing a few crashes.
[08:09] <LjL> jroes: "nv" is an open-source driver, with limited 3D acceleration capabilities. "nvidia" is a proprietary driver from NVidia, with extensive OpenGL support
[08:09] <jrib> jroes: nv is open source, nvidia isn't
[08:09] <Psychobudgie> nv is the xorg nvidia driver, nv is the nvidia binary driver
[08:09] <niekie> Mostly when changing Beryl settings though.
[08:09] <niekie> So, my fault, hehe.
[08:09] <Airwulf> hm isn't it possiuble to make a kde like menu icon
[08:09] <jroes> ah
[08:09] <Psychobudgie> jrib,  other way round
[08:09] <jroes> do you think the open source nv driver probably doesn't support tv out?
[08:09] <LjL> Airwulf: yes it is. well, i don't have Gnome installed, but i'm quite sure it is
[08:09] <jrib> Psychobudgie: hmm?
[08:09] <LjL> Airwulf: you need to remove the current Apps/System/Places applet and replace it with another - don't remember what it's called, but it's there
[08:10] <rajiv_nair> airwulf: take a luk at the screenshots posted on http://sector-zero.blogspot.com u want ur menu bar like that:D?

[08:18] <rajiv_nair> is this netspit or coincidence??
[08:18] <rajiv_nair> :-?
[08:18] <Smotang> Goodnight internets

[08:19] <wuming> is there a firefox plugin that can click through  a web site?
[08:19] <jumassillia> Hi Everyone , how do you find where the digital camera is (filesystem)  ?
[08:20] <xzk> what is the best network utility for Linux?
[08:20] <LjL> !best
[08:20] <ubotu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
=== beuno_ is now known as beuno
[08:21] <ubun> how can i alias rm to be 'rm -i'?
[08:21] <xzk> okay, what is the most reliable application with the most features for a network utility
[08:22] <Sebboh> Can someone recommend a notepad.exe replacement for my desktop?  The default text editor (gedit) is kinda slow on my machine.
[08:22] <lunz> add the line: "alias rm='rm -i'" to your ~/.bashrc
[08:22] <ubun> thanks lunz
[08:23] <rajiv_nair> this cant be coincidence
[08:23] <jrib> wuming: what do you mean?
[08:23] <LjL> Sebboh: i see something called gnotepad+ in the repos, claims to be lightweight...
[08:24] <wuming> jrib,for example. there is a login form on a webpage, is that possible to have a firefox plugin something to auto login that forum( input fields and click login button)
[08:24] <Sebboh> ... Thanks for looking in there for me, LjL. =)  I'll check it out!
[08:24] <we2by> how do u call a software that find all links on a website?
[08:24] <LjL> a spider?
[08:24] <LjL> wget?
[08:24] <rajiv_nair> !spider
[08:25] <ubotu> spider: A two deck solitaire game for the X Window System. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.2-4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 105 kB, installed size 420 kB
[08:25] <mzanfardino> General question: I want to accesss my Ubuntu server (running Edgy) via my Ubuntu desktop (also running Edgy) X interface.  Do I need to have X installed on the server?
[08:25] <rajiv_nair> bah
[08:25] <we2by> lol
[08:25] <we2by> yea, a spider! thanks guys
[08:25] <rajiv_nair> :D:D
[08:25] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, just x libraries
[08:25] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, not the server
[08:25] <LjL> mzanfardino: you can just use SSH i suppose, if you don't want to run graphical applications on the server
[08:26] <mzanfardino> What I want to do is use my graphic programs (Eclipse for instance) to edit files on my server.  So I need to have the x libraries on the server, yes?
[08:26] <mzanfardino> ^installed
[08:26] <ReWT_AxS> how do i set permission to cdrom to play cds with mplayer? says permission denied what iscode i have to type in
[08:26] <LjL> mzanfardino: yes. or, couldn't you just set up file sharing and do it on the client side?
[08:26] <ReWT_AxS> chmod 777 /cdrom
[08:26] <ReWT_AxS> ?
[08:27] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, you'd be better off setting up a networked mount
[08:27] <LjL> mzanfardino: at any rate, if you just installed the program concerned (say Eclipse) on the server, the X libraries will be installed automatically
[08:27] <mzanfardino> LjL: Good question.  I'm relatively new to Linux and not sure how to setup file sharing.  However, given that the files I need access to are in my www path, I'm not sure I want them shared for all acess...
[08:27] <ubun> luns: in my bashrc file it says to put aliases in ~/.bash_aliases so i made that file and put my alias in there but it wont run. do you know how to get it to run?
[08:27] <LjL> mzanfardino: err, that's what access control is for ;-) you know, passwords and the like
[08:28] <jrib> ReWT_AxS: is your user part of the cdrom group?
[08:28] <Mokshu> Hi
[08:28] <mzanfardino> I've installed Ecplise on my desktop.  I jsut want the access to the server.  It sounds like maybe the mounting is a better Idea?
[08:28] <ReWT_AxS> jrib i dunno how do i look
[08:28] <jrib> ReWT_AxS: type 'groups'
[08:28] <LjL> mzanfardino: i'd definitely say so. an NFS or Samba server will do nicely
[08:28] <ReWT_AxS> rewt adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin
[08:28] <_osh> Anyone who can explain my annoying LVM error? http://pastebin.ca/275704. What can be done about it?
[08:28] <lunz> is the ~/.bash_aliases called from .bash.rc ? e.g. source ~/.bash_aliases or . ~/bash_aliases
[08:28] <ReWT_AxS> like im laying a cd
[08:28] <ReWT_AxS> but it wont open in mplayer
[08:29] <Mokshu> Xorg seems to crash when logged as a user using GDM, whereas when I log as as root, it works perfectly. Any idea ?
[08:29] <ReWT_AxS> does mplayer need permission to access the directory?
[08:29] <Belter_> does anybodu know how to configure the Blekin F5D7000
[08:29] <Helicobacter> hi all :)
[08:29] <ubun> lunz: ~/.bash_aliases
[08:29] <ubun> it's called from ~/.bashrc i guess
[08:29] <jrib> ReWT_AxS: pastebin the mplayer output, maybe someone can figure out what is happening
[08:29] <ubun> well no it's commented out in .bashrc
[08:29] <rajiv_nair> does anybody here use mpd??
[08:30] <mzanfardino> Now, mind you this is linux to linux (no windows involved).  So do I still need SMB?  I think all I really want to do is log into my server and initiate an X session (that may be one solution)
[08:30] <ubun> still doent work even when i uncomment it out
[08:30] <xzk> where can I find linux networking utilities, like Network Manager
[08:30] <jrib> ubun: you need to source the file or start bash again
[08:30] <Helicobacter> xzk,  in synaptic ;)
[08:30] <ubun> source the file?
[08:30] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, is your desktop especially slow?
[08:30] <rajiv_nair> system->administration->network tools:D
[08:31] <jrib> ubun: source /path/to/whatever/file/you/have/your/alias/in/wow/that/was/long
[08:31] <ubun> heh
[08:31] <xzk> Helicobacter: what do I search for to get the most results
[08:31] <ReWT_AxS> its not an error
[08:31] <rajiv_nair> lol
[08:31] <xzk> I'm not sure what the keyword is for that
[08:31] <ReWT_AxS> just doesnt see any files in /cdrom/
[08:31] <Helicobacter> xzk,  search for "network " maybe ;)
[08:31] <ubun> thanks it works now :)
[08:31] <xzk> Helicobacter: haha dur

[08:32] <ReWT_AxS> Helicobacter, yes
[08:32] <ollekalle> anyone experienced performance problems with via_rhine driver for ethernet? If so, any suggestions on how to increase traffic capacity?
[08:33] <ReWT_AxS> but only when i had a link on my panel for firefox
[08:33] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: no, my destop runs great.  I think maybe I'm going about this the wrong way.  Let me summarize: I'm writting a web solution which resides on my server.  I'm currently using SSH to access the server, then tools like nano to edit the html, etc.  What I'd like to do is use Eclipse (which I've just installed on my desktop) to do the same work I was doing with nano on the server (that...
[08:33] <mzanfardino> ...same and more)... what is the best approach?
[08:33] <ReWT_AxS> if i opened firefox from my start it didnt show black screen
[08:33] <Helicobacter> ReWT_AxS,  YES , I've exactely the same problem
[08:33] <arpu> hi @all can anybody help me with this problem  kernel: [17180113.224000]  usb 2-2: device not accep

[08:33] <Helicobacter> ReWT_AxS,  do you know how to correct this bug ?
[08:33] <ReWT_AxS> hehe....solution = none.
[08:33] <ReWT_AxS> sucks
[08:33] <Helicobacter> ReWT_AxS,  :(
[08:33] <ReWT_AxS> so i got rid of beryl until it's fixed
[08:34] <ReWT_AxS> how do i give beep media player permission to access /cdrom/ to play my cds
[08:34] <rajiv_nair> helicobacter: u lauchin firefox from panel??
[08:34] <FunnyHat> mzanfardino, best approach would be to jst download the file, edit in eclipse, then upload new file
[08:34] <Helicobacter> ReWT_AxS,  my solution is : When a black screen happen, I launch Metacity
[08:34] <Helicobacter> rajiv_nair,  yes
[08:34] <Helicobacter> from panel
[08:34] <Zero_Ice> hi all, is this the correct room for noob help with Ubuntu LAMP server?
[08:34] <FunnyHat> mzanfardino, that or setup a CVS repository, lol...  (don't bother, lots of work, not worth it for a 1 man project)

[08:34] <ovesenv2> Hi. I've got my dell inspiron 8100 with nvidia go up running with ubuntu 6.10. But there are small, horizontal lines on the left of my screen jumping up and down, 10-20 at a time. How do I get rid of them?
[08:34] <FunnyHat> Zero_Ice, try #ubuntu-server

[08:34] <Limulf> What is the resolution "gnome-about-me" works best with to make an avatar for an user? Thanks :-)
[08:34] <rajiv_nair> there is some tweak in gconf that fixes this
[08:35] <FunnyHat> Zero_Ice, if yo ucan't find help there, I might be able to help you
[08:35] <jrib> Zero_Ice: you can ask here as well, both places are ok
[08:35] <xzk> When I am using Network Manager, it shows all the WiFi hotspots as 100%.. and I know thats not right.. any ideas on how to fix this or what could be causing it
[08:35] <rajiv_nair> helicobactor:u gotta turn off something
[08:35] <Helicobacter> rajiv_nair,  ... in gconf ? for the black screen problem with beryl ?
[08:35] <rohall> Hi everyone, I have a rather general question...When compiling development release software on a machine that already has the package for that software (via apt-get), are there are steps I can take to not ruin the installation/make a huge mess.  I intend to use the packages again when one is released for Mesa 6.5.2.  Thanks! :)
[08:35] <mzanfardino> FunnyHat: so, that being said, what's the easiest way yo transfer files between my desktop machine and my server?  I've been using ftp, but it's a bit labor-intensive.
[08:35] <ReWT_AxS> man can ANYONE help me?
[08:35] <ReWT_AxS> how do i give beep media player permission to access /cdrom/ to play my cds
[08:35] <hjmills> ubun: is that file executable? try "sudo chmod a+x ~/.bash_aliases"
[08:35] <Zero_Ice> Thanks will try there :-)
[08:36] <Molly_156> Hi -- does anyone know where I can get the webmin and webmin-core bundles for edgy server? accourding to the tutorial I just saw on www.debianadmin.com, I should be able to just do an apt-get install for them, but they aren't recognized.
[08:36] <jrib> rohall: install to /usr/local  and use checkinstall
[08:36] <FunnyHat> mzanfardino, use gftp    it's a GUI for ftp rather than command line
[08:36] <dm_> i'm trying to install a plugin for gaim... how can i fix this error: checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[08:36] <jrib> ubotu: tell rohall about checkinstall
[08:36] <ubun> hjmills: i dunno but 'source ~/.bash_alises' did the trick
[08:36] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, I don't think you want to do the remote X way
[08:36] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, check out sshfs + FUSE
[08:36] <Helicobacter> rajiv_nair,  I have not turned off something.... I have the save problem after reboot my X Server

[08:37] <shiv> Is there a way to upgrade my ubuntu desktop to a server edition by changing repos?
[08:37] <rohall> jrib Thanks very much!
[08:37] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, that will let you mount a remote sftp/scp connection into a local directory
[08:37] <LinuxFan> FunnyHat: thanks I will try
[08:37] <jrib> ubotu: tell dm_ about compiling
[08:37] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, and Eclipse will never know the difference
[08:37] <jrib> dm_: what plugin?
[08:37] <J03> i am in need of a good FTP Client. Any recomendations?
[08:37] <jrib> J03: gftp?
[08:37] <dm_> jrib: extended options plugin
[08:37] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: that's what I'm looking for... thank you, I will try that now
[08:38] <Helicobacter> yes, gftp
[08:38] <Helicobacter> :)
[08:38] <arpu> nobody have an idea ? ^^
[08:38] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/SshfsFaq

[08:38] <eriksays> hi all.  my /dev/hdb1 (/mnt/hdb) is in read-only mode, but the /etc/fstab is set to "defaults" for mount options?
[08:38] <Helicobacter> yes rajiv_nair
[08:38] <jrib> dm_: no need to compile that one, just make sure you have enabled universe
[08:39] <rajiv_nair> helicobacter: open Configuration Editor (in applications/accessories, or run 'gconf-editor' in terminal), browse to apps/panel/global and unmark the 'enable_animations'-key.
[08:39] <dm_> jrib: whats enabled universe?

[08:41] <manopulus> hello, i never had any expierence with LVM. can i resize existing partition, create new and then install ubuntu to new partition with debootstrap ?
[08:42] <manopulus> actually there is fedora 5 and LVM
[08:42] <psusi> manopulus: you can do that without lvm as well
[08:42] <Helicobacter> rajiv_nair,  it works good , I do not have black screen now ... thanks ;)
[08:42] <Zero_Ice> hi all, its me again.. no activity in ubuntu-server room so i just need some quickie help
[08:42] <alek66> how can I set my fan to be always on!
[08:42] <manopulus> psusi: how? (system is at colocation)
[08:42] <psusi> without lvm you just have to boot from a livecd
[08:42] <manopulus> no :)
[08:42] <Zero_Ice> I'm following a how too tutorial on www.howtoforge.com for setting up LAMP
[08:43] <Zero_Ice> I'm at the point of setting up mysqladmin pw and i get an error msg
[08:43] <psusi> manopulus: then you probably want to use lvm ;)
[08:43] <Helicobacter> Does somebody know how to install the Multy Layers plugin with Beryl ?
[08:43] <manopulus> psusi: i need resize - and under existing and working
[08:43] <Zero_Ice> the cmd is ", hope you've all been doing good and getting ready for the holiday"
[08:43] <Zero_Ice> error is ", hope you've all been doing good and getting ready for the holiday"
[08:43] <psusi> manopulus: are the disks currently using LVM?
[08:44] <Zero_Ice> oops "error: 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'
[08:44] <Zero_Ice> "
[08:44] <manopulus> psusi: yes
[08:44] <psusi> manopulus: ok... then yea, lvm can do that
[08:45] <manopulus> psusi: lvm then pvscan five me /dev/hdg1, but no idea how to resize
[08:45] <J03> Its not w0rking :( (gFTP)
[08:45] <J03> 227 Entering Passive Mode - its stuck on that :'(
[08:46] <psusi> manopulus: vgchange is the main command to manipulate lvm... is there an existing logical volume you want to resize?  is this shrinking or growing?  does it already have a filesystem on it and you want to keep that filesystem intact?
[08:46] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: I've got it installed, but when I attempt to mount a remote resource, I'm asked for my root@xx.xx.xx.xx password.  Since I use sudo, I don't have a proper root user (that I'm aware of).  Is there a way to create a root user/password on the server (I have full access, it's my server)?
[08:47] <manopulus> psusi: well, there is now fedora core5. i need ubuntu instead. it is colocation. i will not have access to it after reboot - so i haveto do all steps carefully :)
[08:47] <manopulus> psusi: first, need shrink existing partition, then create new, mount and install ubuntu
[08:47] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, sshfs your_user@192.168.1.1:/path/to/remote mountpoint
[08:48] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, the better way would be to add yourself to the "fuse" group
[08:48] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, then you don't need to have root access to do it
[08:48] <psusi> manopulus: have you tried evms?
[08:48] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, I did have to do 'sudo chown root:fuse /dev/fuse', though..
[08:49] <Spaghetti_Knife> Hi, LJ isn't displaying quiz results in my Firefox. Anybody know why?
[08:49] <manopulus> psusi: yum install evms not help me :) no package with such name. really i not know well FC :)
[08:49] <FunnyHat> Spaghetti_Knife, probably a problem with livejournal and not FF
[08:49] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: are you using /dev/fuse as the mount point?  Or should I create something like /mnt/fuse?
[08:49] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, no, /dev/fuse is the fuse device, you can't use it as a mount point
[08:49] <Spaghetti_Knife> FunnyHat: Nevermind, it's working fine. Thanks.
[08:50] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, you could create something like /mnt/server
[08:50] <manopulus> psusi: i have pasted you lvm/pwscan and df-h, can you please look
[08:50] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, or even ~/server
[08:50] <mzanfardino> ok, that's what I thought.  I've created a /mnt/fuse, though I like the /mnt/server better
[08:50] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: ok, I can use ~/server in stead of /mnt/server?
[08:51] <misieq> what is dhcp relay agent? i'm configuring wlan router and don't know if i should enable this? the settings is internet->linux box sharing connection and running dhcp server->router i'm configuring->inner network

[08:51] <ubun> man, wmv files dont wanna play in mplayer or vlc for me or anything
[08:51] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: how do I unmount my sshfs?
[08:51] <ubun> i dont see anything called 'win32codecs' in synaptic and i have universe and multiverse enabled
[08:51] <jturek> is there a command to watch what another user is doing on their shell?
[08:51] <jturek> this user is logged in by ssh to my server
[08:52] <ubun> jturek is bigbrother :(
[08:52] <rajiv_nair> ubun: nah
[08:52] <rajiv_nair> ubun: its w32codecs ur luking for and it aint there in synaptic
[08:52] <jturek> ubun: you have to be, when you let your server be used by idiots
[08:52] <ubun> thanks rajiv_nair
[08:53] <rajiv_nair> ubun: i had to dwnld .deb for w32codecs
[08:53] <ubun> jturek can you just monitor their bash_history or something
[08:53] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, looks like you need to use sudo
[08:53] <jturek> .bash_history is only updated when the person logs out
[08:53] <ubun> oh
[08:53] <jturek> i need a real time monitor of their pts/1
[08:54] <ubun> i dont know much about security but im sure theres sniffers or something that does that
[08:54] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: I've created the connection (worked fine) of /mnt/fuse but I want to drop that and remount to ~/server.  I'm looking at the man files now, but if you can recall how to drop a mounted device, that soulve be helpful! :)

[09:03] <ubun> how i can rename a file named "- foo - bar" to "foobar"  since it starts with a '-'  mv treats it like it's an option to mv and fails
[09:03] <kling0n> mzanfardino: check if the mount was mounted with root ownership
[09:03] <kling0n> ubun: mv ./- foobar
[09:04] <mzanfardino> ubun have you tried \-foo\-bar ?
[09:04] <kling0n> mzanfardino: that will still be parsed as options
[09:04] <ubun> yeah but its not working either
[09:04] <ubun> just says mv --help for more information
[09:04] <mzanfardino> kling0n: how do I check the root ownership/.
[09:04] <jvolkman> mzanfardino, try the option "-o allow_other"
[09:04] <mzanfardino> kling0n: how do I check the root ownership?

[09:05] <ubun> i tried quotes too
[09:05] <fdoving> ubun: mv -- \- foo foobar
[09:05] <J03> Whats the process name for automatix2? its crashed on me -_-
[09:05] <fdoving> ubun: -- is the key.
[09:05] <LjL> !automatix | J03
[09:05] <ubotu> J03: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[09:05] <J03> i know that.
[09:05] <J03> which is why i want to kill the process.
[09:05] <LjL> J03: then you know this is not the right channel for asking... try #automatix
[09:05] <J03> Ok :D
[09:05] <ubun> worked fdovin thanks :)
[09:05] <fdoving> ubun, you're welcome :)
[09:06] <ubun> i would never have figured that out :/
[09:06] <LjL> J03: "ps aux" to see the processes, "kill <PID>" to kill, "kill -s 9 <PID>" if it doesn't die
[09:06] <kling0n> fdoving: is that a bash quirk? the ther syntax works for tcsh
[09:06] <Richard__> rawr
[09:06] <LjL> J03: not sure if it's really a good idea to do that, though. depends what automatix was doing.
[09:06] <J03>  ok :D
[09:06] <J03> crashing, thats what!
[09:06] <J03> lol
[09:06] <jdhore> wow...i think i'm in love with Ubuntu
[09:06] <ubun> ubuntu? UFUNTU!
[09:06] <kling0n> LjL: shouldn't be anything that cant be fixed with apt-get
[09:06] <fdoving> kling0n: that would work for tcsh too, as it's a feature in the mv command.
[09:06] <we2by> Python 2.2 or 2.3 not detected! but python 2.4 is installed
[09:07] <we2by> what should I do?

[09:07] <kling0n> s/og//

[09:08] <LjL> tom_kelleher: did you restart the X server (or the computer) after installing the driver, and did it work then?
[09:08] <robdeman> could anybody help me with choosing the right partition sizes?

[09:09] <robdeman> I want to do a software RAID1 (2x 120GB drives) Now I am thinking to od this /boot = 500MB, /SWAP = 1GB .. how much vor / and /var?
[09:09] <robdeman> I basically do LAMP + tons of videos on thw webserver
[09:09] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: ok, the -o allow_other option seemed to do the trick, thanks
[09:09] <we2by> guys
[09:09] <LjL> tom_kelleher: check /var/log/Xorg.0.log for hints
[09:10] <robdeman> so my problem is: /var = 10GB and / = the rest -- or / = 10 GB and /VAR is the rest ?
[09:10] <mzanfardino> jvolkman: thank you
[09:10] <robdeman> different wiki's say different things here
[09:10] <dabaR> we2by: is that an error or a message?

[09:10] <we2by> I need a little help here. I'm trying to install a program and it needs python 2.2 or python 2.3. but both of them are not in de repos. I can only install python 2.4.
[09:10] <tom_kelleher> LjL ; I have a feeling it's loading the wrong driver at boot.
[09:10] <mzanfardino> now to see if eclipse see's it! :)
[09:11] <LjL> robdeman: i'd give / to the rest, since you haven't mentioned a separate /usr partition
[09:11] <dabaR> we2by: show me this program's install web page.
[09:11] <jc-denton> humm
[09:11] <robdeman> LjL There is only 1 user indeed

[09:11] <LjL> robdeman: uh...? having or not having a separate /usr isn't quite related to the number of users

[09:12] <patrick_king> what can i use for a web end for my webserver
[09:12] <LjL> robdeman: but anyway, what you're saying is: have separate /boot and /var, and keep everything else (including /usr and /home) in a single / partition. that says to me that / is the one you want to be biggest
[09:12] <patrick_king> sorry i mean mail server
[09:12] <LjL> Arrick: check out #ubuntu-bots
[09:13] <jc-denton> wow it even supports dri
[09:13] <robdeman> LjL Yes true. I was advised to seperate /var b/c it tends to fill up with logs right?
[09:13] <LjL> robdeman: fill up... well, 10Gb doesn't sound like it'd fill up that easily, imho. but then, if you're going to put tons on videos on the webserver, those are going to end up in /var/www
[09:14] <LjL> robdeman: but then again, i think i'd make a symbolic link to somewhere else in that case. but that's just me
[09:14] <we2by> dabaR, the homepage is down, but u can download the file from freshmeat link. check the install script

[09:21] <robdeman> ollekalle; ndiswrapper is for *any* windows-based river right? both wireless and non-wireless?
[09:21] <ollekalle> robdeman: Ok. I just breifly looked into the docs. Are there any obvious reason not to use ndiswrapper for a regular LAN?
[09:22] <cayou99> any help with partitions?
[09:22] <sephirot1> I am trying to find out how i can reconfigure the nvidia-glx driver to use xinerama correctly in twin-view.
[09:22] <mc44> ollekalle: your ethernet is not detected?
[09:22] <robdeman> ollekalle: yes. only use ndiswrapper when there is no native linux driver for your networkcard
[09:23] <sephirot1> when i run a full screen video, the picture spills into my monitor
[09:23] <kyd> can it be done ?
[09:23] <ollekalle> mc44: it is detected but my network card doesn't work very well with the driver (via_rhine)
[09:23] <sephirot1> i know- thats what basically, a twinview is supposed to do- but can't help wondering whether i can still use twinview and have the full-screen video ONLY on my TV-screen.
[09:23] <ollekalle> robdeman: is it very CPU consuming or why not use it?
[09:24] <robdeman> ollekalle: I dont know about CPU times.. I had to use it b/c there was no Linux driver available for my card

[09:26] <gumpa> is subversion in a non-standard repos?
[09:26] <LjL> robdeman: if by "volumes" you mean "partitions", there can only be 4 primary partitions on a drive. if you want more than that, you need to create an extended partition containing some logical partitions

[10:02] <LjL> theBishop: that's the stuff that allows to reboot without going through the BIOS, isn't it?

[10:03] <mc44> Gun_Smoke: no problem at all
[10:03] <LjL> DigitalNinja: only if the kernel was updated
[10:03] <LjL> DigitalNinja: otherwise, you might still want to reboot (since it might be simpler than restarting all the services one by one) if security patches for services were applied

[10:20] <ubox> hey don't do tht
[10:21] <boink> he said "hi"
[10:21] <mc44> indeed
[10:21] <Seveas> And I said bye
[10:21] <Spee_Der> Howdy folks, home from work early fpr change. . .
[10:21] <mc44> Seveas: haha
[10:21] <pos69sum> i tried the apt-get dist-upgrade method, changed my sources.list first
[10:21] <mc44> pos69sum: try "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
[10:22] <pos69sum> it0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[10:22] <pos69sum> says its already the newest version
[10:22] <mc44> pos69sum: what did you change?
=== sirex is now known as sire1
[10:22] <pos69sum> i changed dapper to edgy
[10:22] <pos69sum> did a search and replace
[10:23] <monokrome> lol
[10:23] <AtKaaZ> help, how can the console font be changed?
[10:23] <mc44> !downgrade | pos69sum
[10:23] <lupine_85> pos69sum: there is no apt-get dist-downgrade, I'm afraid...
[10:23] <ubotu> pos69sum: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[10:23] <pos69sum> ok
[10:23] <tim_> My nautilus doesnt show any bars and opens everything in a new window, it looks like some common error, but how do i solve it?
[10:24] <mc44> pos69sum: you changed your sources.lists to edgy, and it still doesnt do anything on dist-upgrade?
[10:24] <lupine_85> you didn't forget about apt-get update, did you
[10:24] <pos69sum> no
[10:24] <pos69sum> no
[10:25] <kane77> hi all
[10:25] <ypSami> Hey all. Is there a way to bridge my wifi adapter to my ethernet adapter within my laptop, in order to use the ethernet jack to provide connectivity to the internet for another computer?
[10:25] <mc44> pos69sum: what does "lsb_release -r" say?
[10:25] <pos69sum> 6/
[10:26] <pos69sum> 6.10
[10:26] <Spee_Der> Hello kane
[10:26] <mc44> pos69sum: ok, so you are in edgy. is everthing else working apart from update-manager?
[10:26] <georgeb> hi, do you know anything about an xorg update ? I just saw >50 packages in the update list,  and I can't find any details on the net
[10:26] <pos69sum> seems like it

[10:26] <jorrit> Hello everyone
[10:26] <lupine_85> ypSami: bridge-utils
[10:27] <pos69sum> but i am not sure what else may have broken
[10:27] <lupine_85> or just enable IP forwarding and go from there
[10:27] <jackepc> nas
[10:27] <Sebboh> ...Can I switch my ubuntu machine to kubuntu easily?
[10:27] <Spee_Der> Hello jorrit
[10:27] <ypSami> lupine_85: is it pretty straight forward, or is there a google term I can search for tutorials?
[10:27] <turner> hello
[10:27] <jorrit> Is there a way to download the makefile for the standard x386 Ubuntu Edgy kernel without having compiled the kernel?
[10:28] <lupine_85> ypSami: fairly straightforward. For bridging, the program is called "brctl", IIRC, so google on that might make you happy. for ip forwarding, it's just sane network design so as long as you've got a small clue in that area, you'll be fine
[10:28] <anto9us> Sebboh, as easy as sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[10:28] <Sebboh> thank you.
[10:28] <kane77> friend of mine has a problem... he has a notebook with a wifi, but when he turns on the computer and boots straight to ubuntu he is unable to connect... however if he runs windows first and then boot into ubuntu everything is OK... I found out thet it's because the Wlan option is turned off by default, there is a special key for that, but unfortunately it works only in windows... so how do I turn on the Wlan??
[10:28] <jorrit> I want to compile a new version of the RT2500 klm
[10:28] <turner> I have a problem with my screen resulution -- I changed in the xorg conf what you guys told me to change on yoursebsite -- the thing is I dont know if it's the grapics card or what, because I've never used 1024x768 on this computer (I got this machine for free..) -- it's stuck at 800x600.
[10:28] <Sebboh> ... anto9us, will it be easy to remove gnome?
[10:29] <Sebboh> =)
[10:29] <anto9us> Sebboh, do you really need to?
[10:29] <turner> any ideas?
[10:29] <ypSami> thanks lupine_85, I'll give it a try =)
[10:29] <kane77> Sebboh, its quite easy... I done it once (by mistake)
[10:29] <jorrit> Sorry, everyone  I have to run now to avoid a disaster.
[10:29] <jorrit> Good luck
[10:30] <jorrit> bye
[10:30] <kane77> bye
[10:30] <Sebboh> kane, I'm sold. =)
[10:30] <PuRu> anyone here that installed the nvidia driver?
[10:31] <PuRu> ne = anyone
[10:31] <jrib> !anyone | PuRu
[10:31] <ubotu> PuRu: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[10:31] <PuRu> i can't install the driver, the info on this link is incorrect for my laptop:
[10:32] <PuRu> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[10:32] <kjodleik> hi, i get this error message: Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : SET failed on device eth2 ; Unknown error 524
[10:32] <kjodleik> I'm trying to set a key for wireless 3com through ndiswrapper
[10:32] <Spee_Der> turner
[10:32] <jrib> PuRu: what happens when you try?  At what step does it fail?
[10:32] <PuRu> my card = geforce 420 go
[10:32] <turner> yes, Spee_Der
[10:32] <PuRu> it f*cks up my xorg.conf
[10:32] <Spee_Der> xorg.conf problems turner ?
[10:32] <Turner2> see, I dont know what it is
[10:32] <PuRu> it says: press ctrl-alt-backspace
[10:33] <p10tr> I does anyone have problem with gnome i often lost fucusand can't press any button
[10:33] <Turner2> I put the resulutions that I want in xorg.conf
[10:33] <PuRu> there is goes wrong because the altered xorg.conf = bad
[10:33] <Spee_Der> Ok, and you are wanting to change the resolution ?
[10:33] <Turner2> yes
[10:33] <jrib> PuRu: pastebin your xorg.conf
[10:33] <Spee_Der> Ok....
[10:33] <Turner2> how do I do that?
[10:33] <Spee_Der> Do you at least have a back up for the working xorg.conf ?
[10:33] <PuRu> ok, comming up
[10:33] <PuRu> i'll paste the bad one and the backup
[10:33] <jrib> PuRu: and do you get errors then?  if so, pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:34] <Turner2> xorg.conf works right now
[10:34] <PuRu> let my fetch them
[10:34] <ubox> wht is similar to pine on ubuntu dapper?
[10:34] <PuRu> will do
[10:34] <Crankymonky> Anyone know any good apps that allow one to record off of line-in and maybe some very basic mixing?
[10:34] <Spee_Der> Ok, good. Do you have aback up for the xorg.conf file please ?
[10:34] <Turner2> and yes, I do have a backup
[10:34] <Spee_Der> Ok. Good.
[10:34] <Spee_Der> InCan you please pastebin the currently used xorg.conf so I can see it ?
[10:35] <lokomotive> hi anyone using frostwire?
[10:35] <Turner2> sure
[10:35] <strahlemann> i use limewire pro to download porn
[10:35] <EmFactor> CrankyMonky: How about Audacity?
[10:35] <Spee_Der> Ok, tell me where it is so I can read it and see what it up.....
[10:35] <strahlemann> but it sucks for downloading albums
[10:35] <lokomotive> I use to be able to d/l now it says it has detected a firewall WTF
[10:35] <strahlemann> only porn
[10:35] <yoshig3> I gots a question- why does ubuntu draw things so slow?
[10:35] <strahlemann> and single music :)
[10:35] <Crankymonky> EmFactor, I'm trying it out now
[10:35] <Crankymonky> Thanks for the tip
[10:35] <yoshig3> Will using Xgl cause it to run better too?
[10:36] <kane77> yoshig3, try installing drivers for your graphics... that helps a lot...
[10:36] <PuRu> jrib: just give me some time to reboot with the backup xorg.conf
[10:36] <lokomotive> guys is amule better than frostwire, the latter currently ain't d/lin
[10:36] <jrib> PuRu: sure
[10:36] <PuRu> just so you know its gonna take a few minutes
[10:36] <pike_> lokomotive: sudo iptables -L if that command shows inbound outbound and forward accept then your ubuntu firewall isnt the problem probably your router
[10:38] <Turner2> one sec, having problems with pastebin.
[10:38] <Spee_Der> Ok, n p
[10:38] <Spee_Der> I'm here for a bit anyway....  Will help if able to.
[10:38] <Turner2> ok, I'm installing sshd on the box so I can do it here, the resulution is almost unusuable there, hehe
[10:38] <yoshig3> kane77
[10:39] <yoshig3> I did
[10:39] <yoshig3> I wouldn't be able to run ubuntu graphically on my nvidia card without the drivers
[10:39] <yoshig3> gives an x-server error
[10:39] <yoshig3> so
[10:39] <yoshig3> why does it still run snow.
[10:39] <yoshig3> *slow
[10:39] <PuRu> the other puru thats gonna come in = me lol
[10:39] <yoshig3> like when you drag windows
[10:39] <kane77> yoshig3, what card do you have?
[10:39] <yoshig3> they're all...laggy and slowly drawn
[10:39] <ColonelZarkawi> greetings
[10:39] <yoshig3> nVidia GeForce4 Mx 4000 PCI
[10:39] <yoshig3> 128MB
[10:39] <yoshig3> DDR
[10:39] <yoshig3> it's not a great card
[10:40] <kane77> what drivers have you installed?
[10:40] <yoshig3> but it ran windows better, and I like ubuntu more
[10:40] <yoshig3> the beta ones
[10:40] <yoshig3> the only ones that will work
[10:40] <yoshig3> otherwise I get mem errors and xorg crashes
[10:40] <ere> I have a problem with edgy. I use 1024x768 resolution on my laptop. Connect to a projector. Press Fn/F8 to enable vga-out. The projector scans for a video souce, the ubuntu desktop is displayed on the projector,  but in some weird resolution (1380x768 If I remember correctly). How come? xdpyinfo shows 1024x768 as the used resolution. I use the Intel xserver(xserver-xorg-video-intel).
[10:40] <kane77> yoshig3, I only have a 6150 (onboard one) and it runs fine for me
[10:41] <yoshig3> it doesn't lag at all
[10:41] <yoshig3> *?
[10:41] <yoshig3> Mine draws windows very slowly
[10:41] <kane77> no
[10:41] <yoshig3> Maybe xgl will work?
[10:41] <p10tr> does anyone have this problem with gnome? i often lost focus and can't press any button however system is still working
[10:41] <yoshig3> like...windows, you know, are lagged all over, showing the window all over the screen
[10:41] <kane77> yoshig3, i doubt it..
[10:41] <Turner2> pastebin seems to be hanging, it just sits there when I hit send..
[10:41] <PuRu> gonan have to boot into ubuntu lol
[10:41] <yoshig3> kane, and ideas then?
[10:41] <PuRu> notepad reads xorg.conf wrong
[10:41] <kane77> !nvidia
[10:41] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:41] <yoshig3> It runs everything fine just graphically slow
[10:42] <yoshig3> I know
[10:42] <ColonelZarkawi> PuRu, notepad?
[10:42] <yoshig3> already installed the graphics drivers
[10:42] <yoshig3> otherwise I wouldn't be here on xchat in ubuntu!!!!
[10:42] <Spee_Der> Is ok Turner.... I'm here for a bit before dinner anyway and have lots of patience.....
[10:42] <yoshig3> Byut
[10:42] <yoshig3> *but
[10:42] <PuRu> LOL, yeah multiboot
[10:42] <yoshig3> it's laggz
[10:42] <yoshig3> I already installed the new drivers...
[10:42] <yoshig3> just windows draw laggy.
[10:43] <rambo3> yoshig3, ati nvidia ?
[10:43] <yoshig3> nvidia.
[10:43] <yoshig3> GeForce4 Mx 4000 pci...
[10:43] <yoshig3> it reads it as a AGP card though, as well
[10:43] <robdeman> hey all
[10:43] <rambo3> i dont know nvidia
[10:43] <robdeman> I just installed Ubuntu. What is the default root user name password?
[10:43] <we2by> guys, any LaTex IDE for gnome?
[10:43] <yoshig3> just type sudo su in terminal rob
[10:43] <rambo3> 123456 is default
[10:44] <lokomotive> how can that be it used to be fast, to my knowlegdge I haven't changed anythign
[10:44] <psusi> !root
[10:44] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:44] <yoshig3> sudo su works to get root for me
[10:44] <yoshig3> won't let me login as root.
[10:44] <yoshig3> have to do it that way lol
[10:44] <yoshig3> NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] 
[10:44] <Spee_Der> turner: Be right back, I need a re-fill of cold barley pop. . . .
[10:44] <yoshig3> that's what ubuntu is seeing my graphics card as
[10:44] <yoshig3> and it says Bus type:PCI
[10:44] <LjL> yoshig3: that's quite normal. and you should use "sudo -i" rather than "sudo su"
[10:45] <LjL> Ubotu, tell yoshig3 about root | yoshig3, see the private message from Ubotu
[10:45] <Spee_Der> Turner2: Be right back, I need a re-fill of cold barley pop. . . .
[10:45] <ere> we2by: not for Gnome, but lyx may be useful for you
[10:45] <kjodleik> any idea in how i might get iwconfig to receive my attempt on setting a encryption key? using xubuntu 6.10
[10:45] <fintler> eh....'sudo -s' works for me
[10:45] <yoshig3> yeah I know about the root :D lol
[10:45] <yoshig3> trying to get my windows to draw faster
[10:45] <yoshig3> they draw all slowly
[10:45] <p10tr> does anyone have this problem with gnome? i often lost focus and can't press any button however system 6.06 is still working
[10:45] <Turner2> http://axpr.net/?show=139620
[10:45] <Turner2> there is my xorg.conf
[10:45] <robdeman> hey all
[10:46] <robdeman> what is the main difference bwteen Ubunto Server and Ubunto normal -> no GUI desktop?
[10:46] <Music_Shuffle> Yes.
[10:46] <PuRu> jrib: replacing xorg.conf apperantly didnt do the job :s
[10:46] <jrib> PuRu: ok, let's take a look
[10:46] <kane77> does anyone know how to turn on wLan on laptop??
[10:46] <fintler> robdeman: it's stripped a bit too, doesn't run a lot of crap that the desktop does
[10:46] <Spee_Der> Turner2: Ok, I'm back. I have it open in another tab and will go look at it for you, hang on a bit please.
[10:47] <PuRu> i said didn't :p
[10:47] <fintler> robdeman: you can add the stuff in with apt tho
[10:47] <Turner2> ok
[10:47] <devin_> Anyone in here have their /home mounted to a seprate harddrive?
[10:47] <PuRu> omfg :s
[10:47] <robdeman> fintler: how would I add a desktop with apt?
[10:47] <PuRu> same error...
[10:47] <Shaezsche> is adding noatime,nodiratime,barrier=1 to /etc/fstab Safe?
[10:47] <PuRu> failed to start x server
[10:47] <fintler> robdeman: apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[10:47] <yoshig3> Oh well, after I see how it runs games, I'll have to see if it's just ubuntu being stupid about windows or my computer actually lagging
[10:47] <robdeman> fintler: can i delete it aswell?
[10:47] <fintler> robdeman: with that command
[10:47] <PuRu> view x server output to diagnose?
[10:48] <PuRu> (@ jrib)
[10:48] <fintler> robdeman: yep...with apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop ...although I wouldn't recommend adding then removing it if it's an actual server
[10:48] <Belter_> how can I run my own Email server with dyndns
=== Turner2 is now known as Turner
[10:48] <jrib> PuRu: sure, but you need to pastebin your files so everyone here can see them
[10:48] <lovloss> *in desperation* does anyone *HERE* know how to fix beryl?
[10:48] <adaptr> Belter_: by installing the dyndns client to update your dns whenever your IP changes
[10:49] <adaptr> lovloss: what did you break ?
[10:49] <xzela> lovloss: what did you break?
[10:49] <lovloss> lol
[10:49] <PuRu> i know but i can't pastebin if ubuntu doesnt start
[10:49] <Spee_Der> Turner2: Ok. I t looks nice, and everything appears to be correct. What is the problem ? Are you stuck in one resolution ?
[10:49] <sholden> Hi everyone, I'm currently running Ubuntu Edgy with ATI drivers and with dual head enabled.  I'm having trouble getting my XGL session started.  Does anyone have experience setting that up?
[10:49] <Turner> yeah, 800x600
[10:49] <PuRu> grrr @ nvidai shitty card
[10:49] <lovloss> I didnt break anything, i just dont get it. I have 4 desktops down in the bar, but my "cube" has 8 sides, and no caps....
[10:49] <Spee_Der> Oh boy....
[10:49] <Spee_Der> Ok lesee. . . .
[10:49] <Belter_> which is the easiest Email server to run
[10:49] <lovloss> and whenever i click to switch a window, all of the windows have to burn away
[10:49] <PuRu> the only damn thing keeping me away from ubuntu = the videocard
[10:50] <Spee_Der> Your monitor. Do you have the corret specs for the monitor, like the VERT and HORIZ ?
[10:50] <Belter_> Buy another video card you won't regret it
[10:50] <Turner> I dont know those
[10:50] <xzela> lovloss: awesome, try messing with the settings in the beryl-manager
[10:50] <Turner> it's a 19 inch monitor
[10:50] <PuRu> it said kernel mismatch but i just replaced xorg.conf with the backup :s
[10:50] <Spee_Der> Ok. What is the name and model of the monitor please ?
[10:50] <lovloss> xzela: so i have, but it seems like a bug to me
[10:50] <Shaezsche> is adding noatime,nodiratime,barrier=1 to /etc/fstab Safe?
[10:50] <Turner> Envision EN-910E
[10:51] <Belter_> Anybody recommend an easy to use mail server for Ubuntu
[10:51] <adaptr> lovloss: Beryl's settings have little to do with the "normal" desktop
[10:51] <vlt> !wmv > vlt
[10:51] <georgeb> lovloss: that's not a bug, that's a feature :) look in beryl-manger, I think at the "cube" section, to configure the number of cubes
[10:51] <Turner> the options to change resulution dont show up in X though
[10:51] <Turner> just shows 800x600
[10:51] <lovloss> georgeb: ok ill try
[10:51] <georgeb> lovloss: the number of faces on the cube^
[10:51] <adaptr> Belter_: Exim or Postfix are both simple to set up
[10:51] <Spee_Der> Turner: Ok. Gimme a minute to tind the specs for that monitor please......
[10:51] <xzela> lovloss: I would try removing all of the settings and adding them back one at a time to see which features best suit your need
[10:51] <Belter_> Adaptr: Cheers m8
[10:51] <lovloss> good idea... okay, thanks
[10:52] <Turner> ok
[10:52] <PuRu> gonna try to replace again
[10:52] <PuRu> cant see where it failed...
[10:52] <adaptr> xzela: that could present some weird issues for the uninitiated.. if you switch off every setting in Beryl you will be left with windows that cannot be moved, sized, or in any way manipulated usefully....
[10:52] <yoshig3> well
[10:52] <yoshig3> Question
[10:52] <adaptr> I dare you
[10:52] <yoshig3> why does ubuntu have so many problems graphically?
[10:52] <julio> alguien en espaol?
[10:53] <adaptr> haven;t seen one yet...
[10:53] <yoshig3> No one makes drivers for debian?
[10:53] <yoshig3> not ati or nvidia?
[10:53] <julio> tengo una duda de principiante
[10:53] <Music_Shuffle> !es
[10:53] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[10:53] <adaptr> exqueeze me ? Ubuntu has hands down the fewest graphics issues of any distro I've ever seen
[10:53] <yoshig3> well
[10:53] <adaptr> yoshig3: how many distro's have you set up ?
[10:53] <yoshig3> why do all of my windows size so slowly?
[10:53] <Music_Shuffle> No podemos ayudarte aqui. =[
[10:53] <yoshig3> I'm new to ubuntu
[10:53] <adaptr> if it's less than 5, forget it
[10:53] <yoshig3> All of my windows draw very slow
[10:54] <adaptr> yoshig3: video hardware ?
[10:54] <yoshig3> Lag all over the desktop and other windows
[10:54] <jrib> PuRu: if you want,  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, use "vesa".  That should get you into X and then you can pastebin the logs and such
[10:54] <adaptr> yeah, yeah, enough already
[10:54] <xzela> adaptr: true, i guess i would recommend removing all unnecessary settings that is, within reason
[10:54] <yoshig3> GeForce4 Mx 4000 PCI 128mb
[10:54] <psusi> yoshig3: probably because you aren't using the proper video driver
[10:54] <adaptr> xzela: both these wualifications might not be obvious to a newcomer.. especially if he is also a newcomer to X in general :)
[10:54] <yoshig3> What driver am I supposed to use then?
[10:54] <yoshig3> I'm using the nvidia driver, otherwise Xserver fails to start.
[10:55] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: nvidia-glx
[10:55] <yoshig3> The BETA driver.
[10:55] <adaptr> yoshig3: check the ubuntu wiki if that is supported by the closed soucre nvidia driver - if it is, you're in luck
[10:55] <yoshig3> Yes, I'm using nvidia-glx
[10:55] <guitaristmetal35> ubuntu-fr
[10:55] <yoshig3> I am I am
[10:55] <yoshig3> I already looked
[10:55] <adaptr> yoshig3: and you have direct rendering active ?
[10:55] <PuRu> jrib: i know, just trying once more to replace the backup
[10:55] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: did you install the restricted-modules package for your kernel?
[10:55] <jrib> PuRu: ok
[10:55] <PuRu> i must have made a mistake
[10:55] <yoshig3> GeForce4 Mx 4000 is on the beta list, not legacy
[10:55] <yoshig3> well, how do I enable direct rendering?
[10:55] <yoshig3> And, yes I did gnome lol
[10:56] <PuRu> replace WITH the backup
[10:56] <yoshig3> did that about 4 times...apt-get update...blahblah
[10:56] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: what is the error you are getting when it fails to laod?
[10:56] <PuRu> btw: whats the difference between generic mode and 386 ?
[10:56] <yoshig3> well, before I installed the beta drivers
[10:56] <adaptr> yoshig3: no, not how do you enable it - IS it enabled ? #glxinfo | grep direct
[10:56] <yoshig3> it tried to use my onboard intel card
[10:56] <yoshig3> and after the drivers, it ran like this.
[10:57] <yoshig3> so I'd get a mem error using the old nvidia drivers
[10:57] <Spee_Der> Turner: Is that a Sony 19" monitor please ?
[10:57] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: change the BUSID line to what pci slot the nvidia card is in
[10:57] <PuRu> pfffffffffff
=== adml is now known as alindeman
[10:57] <PuRu> WTF
[10:57] <Turner> no, it says Envision
[10:57] <Turner> Envision EN-910E
[10:57] <Spee_Der> Turner: Ok.... hang on......
[10:57] <lokomotive> anyone tried Democracy Player, rofl@titel
[10:57] <yoshig3> it's in the first pci slot
[10:58] <yoshig3> and I did I did, but then I get a invalid xorg error.
[10:58] <yoshig3> I cahnged the busid and all that bullshit
[10:58] <robdeman> hey all what is the best way to transfer files from my windows desktop to my fresh ubuntu server?
[10:58] <yoshig3> xorg error.
[10:58] <yoshig3> rob, network
[10:58] <PuRu> i just dont get it :s
[10:58] <yoshig3> or CD
[10:58] <robdeman> yeah
[10:58] <robdeman> samba?
[10:58] <PuRu> i replace the right file with the right file and nothing happens...
[10:58] <jrib> PuRu: please check if xserver-xorg-driver-nv is installed
[10:59] <yoshig3> adaptr
[10:59] <Music_Shuffle> robdeman, you can just...
[10:59] <PuRu> just a sec i'm gonna set it to vesa
[10:59] <fuffal0> is there anyway to write to a windows file server from ubuntu?  Or is the only way samba-ntfs-write (experimental)
[10:59] <Music_Shuffle> Get on the Ubuntu desktop if theyre on the same LAN
[10:59] <jrib> PuRu: oops, I mean xserver-xorg-video-nv
[10:59] <yoshig3> What's the command to see if it is enabled?
[10:59] <Music_Shuffle> And drag-drop the files over, and then uninstall gdm.
=== tristan|work is now known as tristan|away
=== bash is now known as kadu
[10:59] <robdeman> Music_Schuffle: yes its on the same LAN
[10:59] <robdeman> Music_Schuffle: I need something called 'GDM' ?
[11:00] <morghot> robdeman: start your ssh server on linux and instal winscp in windows
[11:01] <Music_Shuffle> robdeman, well, its the Gnome GUI, and it autorecognizes Windows machines on the same network, pulls up a shiny network connection thing...just me, but that's how I would do it instead of SSH.
[11:01] <yoshig3> WTF
[11:01] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: im kind of busy atm
[11:01] <yoshig3> I'm getting mad
[11:01] <yoshig3> I can't really get any help on this issue from even the official ubuntu place
[11:01] <yoshig3> damn
[11:01] <yoshig3> Maybe ubuntu just shouldn't be used ;.;
[11:01] <stephen> anyone willing to help a noob?
[11:01] <yoshig3> yeah and stephen damnit don't steal my name

[11:02] <stephen> i am trying to congif my 'puter for dual display
[11:02] <stephen> this is day 3 on unbuntu
[11:02] <yoshig3> this is day 1 for me
[11:02] <yoshig3> and I can't get any help really
[11:02] <yoshig3> I started to get help
[11:02] <yoshig3> but then they just left
[11:02] <Spee_Der> Turner: I'm having a heck of a time finding the HORIZ & VERT specs for that monitor......  Hnag in there though....
[11:02] <jrib> !enter | yoshig3
[11:02] <ubotu> yoshig3: Please don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation, it's spam and it's annoying! (in other words <Enter> please <Enter> don't <Enter> type like this)
[11:03] <yoshig3> ...wow.
[11:03] <stephen> i just want to be sure that I can get back to reconfigure the display (restore the backup of the config) from the command prompt if needs be
[11:03] <Turner> sure,
[11:03] <PuRu> jrib: is there anyway to not reconfige the keyboard and everything?
[11:03] <morphex_> i need help with beryl pls when i start beryl-manager im getting that error ** (beryl-manager:5256): WARNING **: Beryl caught deadly signal 11
[11:03] <morphex_> someone can help?
[11:03] <stephen> i would think so, given what i've seen so far
[11:03] <yoshig3> Anyone willing to help me with my graphics card problems at all?
[11:03] <Turner> It's just that the options are not showing up in XFce's display settings
[11:03] <Turner> I dont know if there's a way to add that or something
[11:03] <pike_> stephen: i would just use twinview if you have nvidia card
[11:03] <stephen> no, I have an ATI
[11:03] <stephen> I am planning on trying Merged FB
[11:03] <PuRu> stephen, be glad with it !
[11:04] <PuRu> nvidia seems to suck bigtime
[11:04] <lupine_85> yoshig3: you're asking for support w/rt unsupported beta drivers....
[11:04] <stephen> I just don't want to have to reinstall the entire system if I mess it up
[11:04] <yoshig3> Um
[11:04] <stephen> that's what i had to do the last time i tried
[11:04] <lupine_85> do the ones in the official repo work?
[11:04] <Spee_Der> Turner: Yes there is. You need to make some minor change to the xorg.conf, but I need to locate the proper values for that monitor in order to do it......  So bear with me, please....
[11:04] <PuRu> jrib: is there anyway to not reconfige the keyboard and everything?
[11:04] <yoshig3> so are you saying that I am not supported ot use ubuntu with my nVidia card?
[11:05] <Turner> ok
[11:05] <Turner> I'm not in a hurry.
[11:05] <lupine_85> ubuntu supports their packaging of the nvidia driver
[11:05] <yoshig3> I ahve to use some old crappy card to use ubuntu?
[11:05] <pike_> if you use linux you want an nvidia card for 3d ati is problematic
[11:05] <stephen> how to you restore xorg from the command prompt, in the event you can't get ubuntu to boot?
[11:05] <yoshig3> Well obviously the driver doesn't work.
[11:05] <stephen> dwell not to boot, but to start up..
[11:05] <morphex_> pls help with beryl-manager im still getting that error ** (beryl-manager:5256): WARNING **: Beryl caught deadly signal 11
[11:05] <lupine_85> e.g. the ones in linux-restriced-modules and nvidia-glx that are /in the ubuntu restricted repository/
[11:05] <stephen> well ATI is all I have to work with at the moment
[11:05] <jrib> PuRu: only if you edit the file by hand.  Just leave the defaults
[11:05] <Turner> be right back
[11:05] <PuRu> omg
[11:05] <lupine_85> no, the drivers do work
[11:05] <PuRu> ok i'll try to keep the mouse / keyboard working :s
[11:06] <lupine_85> have you followed the instructions in the wiki?
[11:06] <PuRu> i think of this as a serious lack though
[11:06] <jrib> PuRu: you should be fine with the default options it chooses
[11:06] <Loevborg> Installing Edgy on my 2 GHz P4, 256MB RAM (-32 MB graphics card RAM) laptop is unbearably slow. Any idea why?
[11:06] <Music_Shuffle> Loevborg, disk is the problem perhaps?
[11:06] <Frederick> folks wich is the command to invoke the verilog package?
[11:06] <griffiti93> can anyone help me with postfix ?
[11:06] <stephen> I have seen in a forum that MergedFB works with my card. I want to try that, but want to know how I would restore xorg by command prompt if need be..
[11:06] <ere> I have a problem with edgy. I use 1024x768 resolution on my laptop. Connect to a projector. Press Fn/F8 to enable vga-out. The projector scans for a video souce, the ubuntu desktop is displayed on the projector,  but in some weird resolution (1380x768 If I remember correctly). How come? xdpyinfo shows 1024x768 as the used resolution. I use the Intel xserver(xserver-xorg-video-intel).
[11:06] <Loevborg> Music_Shuffle, no I don't even get to the disk part
[11:06] <buscu> Hello, I would like to create a desktop theme myself. Does exist a themes editor for ubuntu gnome ?
[11:07] <lupine_85> stephen: you'd make a backup of /etc/X11/xorg.conf ... :)
[11:07] <Music_Shuffle> Well, I meant tha tperhaps the CD is messed, but since you say that, I would say the same thing...except more vehemently now.
[11:07] <griffiti93> postfix was working fine
[11:07] <griffiti93> then I noticed emails were not going out
[11:07] <stephen> yes
[11:07] <griffiti93> logged in to server and it was not running
[11:07] <Turner> back
[11:07] <Spee_Der> Turner: Are you in Ubuntu v6.06 LTS please ?
[11:07] <yoshig3> Does PM'ing not work on this server or something?
[11:07] <griffiti93> so tried to start it  /etc/init.d/restart
[11:07] <griffiti93> it just hangs
[11:07] <Turner> I'm in ubuntu with Xfce.
[11:08] <Turner> not gnome
[11:08] <griffiti93> so I removed it   sudo apt-get --purge remove postfix
[11:08] <griffiti93> and reinstalled
[11:08] <griffiti93> it sill hangs when trying to start
[11:08] <Loevborg> Music_Shuffle, maybe..., I burnt it normally though
[11:08] <angel12> t i downloaded, i cant update my sources
[11:08] <buscu> any themes editor ?
[11:08] <Spee_Der> Turner: Ok, I do not know Xfce, but I do know xorg.conf, so bear with me please. I have half the infos I need. . . .
[11:08] <PuRu> jrib: i live in belgium so i have an azerty keyboard so standard ist fine :p
[11:08] <Music_Shuffle> Loevborg, I did the same, but I have a broken Edgy 64 disk sitting right here...brand new pack of disks.  It can happen. =/
[11:08] <Turner> ok
[11:08] <stephen> is there a command line I would use to restore xorg from a command prompt, i the event i had configed xorg wrong?
[11:08] <PuRu> omfg x wont work no more :(
[11:09] <griffiti93> when I kill the process I get error message
[11:09] <PuRu> not with any driver
[11:09] <stephen> is it just the filepath and a command?
[11:09] <griffiti93> dpkg: error processing postfix (--configure)
[11:09] <jrib> PuRu: check that the package I mentioned is installed
[11:09] <PuRu> i'm thinking of kicking it off my system
[11:09] <lupine_85> yoshig3: not unless you're registered
[11:09] <PuRu> i do not even know how in command line
[11:09] <griffiti93> Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[11:09] <pike_> stephen: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg probably easiest for you
[11:09] <yoshig3> not unless I'm registerd.
[11:10] <yoshig3> WTF is that supposed to mean?
[11:10] <stephen> what does that do to the xorg file?
[11:10] <yoshig3> Why should I have to register on IRC to get help for ubuntu?
[11:10] <lupine_85> ...
[11:10] <Gun_Smoke> once in a directory what command do I use to list what is located there?
[11:10] <lupine_85> what's wrong with help on a public channel?
[11:10] <lupine_85> ubuntu doesn't own freenode, you know
[11:10] <yoshig3> I told you, I don't know jack about ubuntu, I came here to get help, and I can't seem to find any.
[11:10] <yoshig3> NOWAY!
[11:10] <Gun_Smoke> yoshig3:  Whats up?
[11:10] <Music_Shuffle> Umm...sure you can find help.
[11:10] <yoshig3> I thot it ownd eet!
[11:11] <Loevborg> Music_Shuffle, I'm trying the "check CD integrity" menu
[11:11] <Tschaka> yoshig3 i suppose thats some way to keep it free of some spammers and stuff eh?
[11:11] <jrib> PuRu: apt-cache policy xserver-xorg-video-nv
[11:11] <PuRu> wtf :s
[11:11] <Gun_Smoke> yoshig3:  Ok, well what do you need help with?

[11:11] <yoshig3> Well.
[11:11] <Music_Shuffle> !spam
[11:11] <PuRu> wtf is going on :s
[11:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about spam - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:11] <Music_Shuffle> !pastebin
[11:11] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:11] <yoshig3> I'm using beta nvidia drivers and everything is laggy, so I want to revert to the NORMAL nVIDIA DRIVERS FOR UBUNTU. THE ONES THAT ARE SUPPORTED.
[11:11] <Music_Shuffle> So revert.
[11:12] <LordUltimaDavid> sorry
[11:12] <yoshig3> So, how would I go about doing this? The documentations on the website aren't helping.
[11:12] <lupine_85> how did you install the beta drivers?
[11:12] <Music_Shuffle> Not a problem. :)
[11:12] <yoshig3> from terminal
[11:12] <lupine_85> ...
[11:12] <yoshig3> Because I can't start xorg at all without them
[11:12] <lupine_85> using the .run file? apt-get?
[11:12] <PuRu> the docs don't help me at all either :(
[11:12] <PuRu> similar problem
[11:12] <yoshig3> I installed ubuntu, installed my graphics card, and then installed the beta drivers because it won't run x wihtout them.
[11:12] <c0ldfusi0n> Hey guys i have a problem. I tried installing Dapper, 6.10, Kubuntu and i get the same error everytime when i try to install. Something like "connection reset by peer: no screen found". I have an ATI x800 on an AMD64, anyone can help?
[11:13] <PuRu> omfg :(
[11:13] <jrib> PuRu: please join me in #ubuntu-classroom
[11:13] <stefg> !ati
[11:13] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:13] <PuRu> i trew away hours and hours :(
[11:13] <lupine_85> what method did you use to install the nvidia beta drivers?
[11:13] <Gun_Smoke> once in a directory, what command do I use to see what is in it?
[11:13] <stefg> ls
[11:13] <yoshig3> I was using apt-get
[11:13] <Tschaka> Gun_Smoke dir or ls
[11:13] <Gun_Smoke> thanks!
[11:13] <PuRu> jrib: done
[11:13] <P2500> Hey guys, I need to set up Xinerama to get my screens to work together. Anyone here know of a good Howto?
[11:13] <yoshig3> and I got the beta drivers installed and ubuntu login screen came up.
[11:14] <c0ldfusi0n> stefg: If that was for me, please note the part where i say "when i try to install" which usually involves that nothing is installed yet, which consequently means that i have no access to the internet even less the occasion to install drivers.
[11:14] <Spee_Der> Turner: Ok, found the infos. Now I need to edit you xorg.conf and then let you look at it for the changes......
[11:14] <yoshig3> If I don't have those drivers installed, it tries to use my onboard crap.
[11:14] <Gun_Smoke> Ok, now I couldn't rm a directory?  what do I need to do?
[11:14] <Loevborg> Music_Shuffle, no, the disc seems okay (MD5-wise)
[11:14] <lupine_85> ok. So remove the repository you added (it'll be in /etc/apt/sources.list). Then run:- sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r); sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) nvidia-glx
[11:14] <yoshig3> So, how can I install the supported Ubuntu nVidia drivers?
[11:14] <c0ldfusi0n> Gun_Smoke: rmdir <dir>
[11:14] <Tschaka> yoshig3 disable the onboard thing in bios. then install the drivers with the run package
[11:14] <stephen> thanks pike. i'll give that a shot
[11:14] <stefg> c0ldfusi0n: sure, you're talking to me ??
[11:14] <Music_Shuffle> Loevborg, and how far did you say it gets you when you put it in?
[11:14] <lupine_85> no. /don't/ use the .run if you can help it
[11:14] <c0ldfusi0n> stefg: I thought your previous reference to ATI drivers was directed to me.
[11:14] <Gun_Smoke> c0ldfusi0n:  Thanks.
[11:15] <orangeoli> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:15] <yoshig3> lupine, are those commands for me?
[11:15] <lupine_85> yes
[11:15] <yoshig3> won't it kill my x when I remove nvidia?
[11:15] <yoshig3> Won't I be kicked to terminal
[11:15] <lupine_85> no
[11:15] <yoshig3> *?
[11:15] <stefg> Ahhh... ok, Oh, i just wanted the bot to spit a link out for you...
[11:15] <yoshig3> but xorg wouldn't even start up without the nvidia drivers
[11:15] <Loevborg> Music_Shuffle, it gets to the desktop, then I click on the installer item. Every move seems slow by then, but every installer step takes aprox. 1 minute to load (!). Then, when garted is to start, it grinds to a halt.
[11:15] <lupine_85> the .ko is in ram right now so it couldn't care less what you're doing with it on disc
[11:15] <yoshig3> it shows a mem error, cant allocate...
[11:15] <forsaker> hi :>
=== ryu2 is now known as ryu
[11:16] <Music_Shuffle> Loevborg, perhaps burn another disk and see if that helps? If not, then keep troubleshooting?
[11:16] <Loevborg> Music_Shuffle, yes, thanks
[11:16] <Turner> Spee_Der -- I think I found it!
[11:16] <c0ldfusi0n> I tried installing 6.06LTS (web iso), 6.10 (web iso), Kubuntu (dvd) and i get the same error everytime when i try to install. Something like "connection reset by peer: no screen found". I have an ATI x800 on an AMD64, anyone can help?
[11:16] <Turner> I came across them here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=221174&page=39
[11:16] <Turner> I put those in and it worked!
[11:17] <Music_Shuffle> c0ldfusi0n, its not the chip....I have an AMD64. Card or the monitor.
[11:17] <yoshig3> lupine, this is what I had in my repository deb http://albertomilone.com/drivers/edgy/nonlegacy/32bit binary/
[11:17] <forsaker> Can someone help me on how to mantain a mixed system on ubuntu? (i.e. dapper with some edgy packets or edgy with some feisty program ) ... I found this debian guide but it doesn't seem to work..  http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-apt-get.it.html#s-default-version
[11:17] <stefg> yoshig3: ... errrr... might be easier to backup and reinstall... reinstall time: ~ 30 min. ./. troubleshooting time: ? hours :-)
[11:17] <forsaker> now an apt-get upgrade wants to update half of my system...
[11:17] <yoshig3> reinstall? why, I just installed.
[11:17] <Music_Shuffle> stefg, it is actually, for what he wants to do.
[11:17] <c0ldfusi0n> Music_Shuffle: I'm on XP right now, both work fine. I can also see the console-like text as well as the boot menu.
[11:18] <dooglus> what program can I use to edit .pdf files?
[11:18] <lupine_85> erm, don't reinstall
[11:18] <vontux> does anyone in here know if most usb 2.0 hd enclosures are ubuntu compatible out of the box?
[11:18] <yoshig3> so just delte that
[11:18] <lupine_85> just remove that line from /etc/apt/sources.list, and do the commands I gave earlier
[11:18] <lupine_85> yeah
[11:18] <yoshig3> alright, brb
[11:18] <yoshig3> lemme tell you how it goes
[11:18] <yoshig3> btw, lupine
[11:18] <stefg> yoshig3: so count that on the experience side and be wiser next time....
[11:18] <lupine_85> this isn't windows, stefg :p
[11:18] <yoshig3> appreciate you helping
[11:18] <lupine_85> np
[11:18] <Tschaka> sudo apt-get update before >.<
[11:18] <stefg> lupine_85: true... but it's still nvidia :-)
[11:18] <lupine_85> nvidia > ati
[11:19] <yoshig3> Okay now lupine
[11:19] <yoshig3> I have a problem
[11:19] <Music_Shuffle> c0ldfusi0n, eh...perhaps the card then. In which case, I can't help you. *Has an Nvidia card*
[11:19] <yoshig3> it won't let me save sources.list.
[11:19] <Music_Shuffle> Did you use sudo when you opened it?
[11:19] <Tschaka> sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.lost yoshig3
[11:19] <Music_Shuffle> sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:19] <Tschaka> sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list yoshig3  *
[11:19] <Music_Shuffle> If you used that, you should be able to save it.
[11:19] <c0ldfusi0n> I'll try installing with the alternate CD.
[11:20] <lupine_85> erm, gksudo not sudo
[11:20] <lupine_85> or just edit it with nano
[11:20] <lupine_85> or sed :p
[11:20] <Tschaka> doenst care oO
[11:20] <Tschaka> if sudo or gksudo
[11:20] <Tschaka> it will ask you for PW anyway
[11:20] <Music_Shuffle> True, but I like gedit better xD
[11:20] <Arwen> stefg, CS?
[11:20] <yoshig3> there saved

[11:23] <Spee_Der> Hi TaT  8-)
[11:23] <dooglus> what program can I use to edit .pdf files?
[11:23] <ToHellWithGA> i have installed the etherboot package but do not know where it installed to or how to use it.
[11:24] <TaTiKa> hey...

[11:24] <ubotu> MythTV is a TV framework for Linux - Instructions for using with Ubuntu at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV
[11:24] <ToHellWithGA> dooglus: you don't exactly.  pdf is a layout/display format.  you can edit them by hand but that would be a pain
[11:24] <TaTiKa> if I get install all my ntfs partitions
[11:24] <LordUltimaDavid> well pastebin wont let me paste, gaim is(this is the very end of it)
[11:24] <LordUltimaDavid> dns[14280] : Oops, father has gone, wait for me, wait...!

[11:24] <yoshig3> alright well
[11:25] <TaTiKa> but cant be writte in
[11:25] <ToHellWithGA> ubotu: please tell TaTiKa about enter
[11:25] <TaTiKa> do I can install ntfs-3g?
[11:25] <yoshig3> do I type sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) ?
[11:25] <Arwen> TaTiKa, ?
[11:25] <Arwen> !ntfs-3g
[11:25] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[11:25] <lupine_85> yep
[11:25] <TaTiKa> thanks
[11:25] <lupine_85> you can just copy & paste the whole line
[11:25] <Arwen> how does ntfs-3g work?
[11:25] <lupine_85> the ; separates commands
[11:25] <adaptr> lupine_85: yoshig3: that would actually remove the supported drivers
[11:25] <lupine_85> no
[11:26] <lupine_85> it'll remove the current drivers s/he has
[11:26] <LordUltimaDavid> so no one can help me with gaim?
[11:26] <lupine_85> which in this case are 9626 or 9629
[11:26] <adaptr> not unless they were installed AS l-r-modules
[11:26] <Arwen> LordUltimaDavid, what do you need?
[11:26] <lupine_85> ...which they were....
[11:26] <lupine_85> ^^
[11:26] <adaptr> I;m pretty sure Debian gets that much versioning right
[11:26] <vontux> LordUltimaDavid: what help do you need?
[11:26] <yoshig3> removed. adding.....
[11:26] <LordUltimaDavid> arwen: gaim is "core dump"ing me
[11:26] <apollo2011> I installed Kubuntu on my friends system a week ago and once time when it shutdown, it would freeze until we pulled the plug on it. Apparently, that happened again and afterward, it wouldn't boot. i have now been trying to find out what is wrong with the partition, and i get an error with cfdisk, stating "FATAL ERROR: Bad logical partition 6 [part6 being the '/' partition] : enlarged logical paritions overlap" Can and how do I fix
[11:26] <apollo2011> the partition? I can't mount it from the live cd (live cd essentially freezzes), and parted and qtparted don't seem to have any problems, although qtparted freezes when it begins gathering info on partition 6.
[11:27] <adaptr> I'm actually curious now ...
[11:27] <Arwen> LordUltimaDavid, as in segmentation fault? have you done anything weird?
[11:27] <gnomefreak> LordUltimaDavid: there are a bunch of bugs on that issue anywhere from chatting on aim to signing into msn
[11:27] <Tschaka> apollo2011 seems as if the drive/partition is damaged
[11:27] <dooglus> ToHellWithGA: I have 4 pdf files, each with a graphic on them, but the graphics are too small, and I want them all in one document.  that's what i meant by editing
[11:27] <LordUltimaDavid> arwen: i update beryl to 1.3 but gaim worked after that
[11:27] <Music_Shuffle> apollo2011, Ive had that happen before
[11:27] <gnomefreak> LordUltimaDavid: i would file a bug on it
[11:28] <yoshig3> alright lupine
[11:28] <Tschaka> try to read from the drive with some drivers from windows or something...i would guess
[11:28] <yoshig3> I installed them
[11:28] <Arwen> LordUltimaDavid, beryl 1.3? mine's 0.1.2.....
[11:28] <yoshig3> now what should I do?
[11:28] <Arwen> fair*
[11:28] <LordUltimaDavid> arwen: it is a seg fault
[11:28] <Music_Shuffle> I hit the reset button and on the next boot, it started an auto-correction program that fixed it.
[11:28] <lupine_85> you can either reboot, or (in true linux style ;) ), do:- ctrl+alt+f1 then login; followed by:- sudo /etc/init.d/?dm stop; sudo modprobe -r nvidia; sudo modprobe nvidia; /etc/init.d/?dm reload
[11:28] <apollo2011> Music_Shuffle: would you happen to have an HP computer?
[11:28] <ouroboros> Hello all!  I am trying to get a UVC video device working.  It exists as a device, but doesn't work.  When ekiga tries to use it, dmesg generates the following error:

[11:28] <Arwen> LordUltimaDavid, have you sent a bug? I can't say much without more details, and even then I'm not the best guy to ask - sorry
[11:28] <LordUltimaDavid> arwen: yea 1.3
[11:28] <Juftus> dooglus: I doubt if this helps, but take a look at pdftk.
[11:29] <Tschaka> yoshig3 crtl+alt+backspace will restart your x-server
[11:29] <Music_Shuffle> apollo2011, sony Vaio actually.
[11:29] <lupine_85> Arwen: nope, latest is 0.1.3
[11:30] <lupine_85> I spent all last night/this morning packaging it :p
[11:30] <Arwen> lupine_85, 0.1.3? my mirror might be late, lol

[11:31] <LordUltimaDavid> im look for a aim client for linux (ubuntu 6.10)
[11:31] <lupine_85> it no longer exists IIRC
[11:31] <Arwen> lupine_85, is there a change log?
[11:31] <Tschaka> LordUltimaDavid try gaim ;)
[11:31] <lupine_85> or it might do
[11:31] <lupine_85> either way, you should use ubuntu.beryl-project.org
[11:31] <adaptr> LordUltimaDavid: something wrong with your Gaim installation ?
[11:31] <LordUltimaDavid> and gaim doesnt work anymore
[11:32] <LordUltimaDavid> adaptr: yes
[11:32] <Arwen> lupine_85, oh wait.... I changed to media.blutkind.org/xgl a while ago
[11:32] <adaptr> LordUltimaDavid: so.. perhaps you'd better try to *fix* that ?
[11:32] <LordUltimaDavid> adaptr: or replace it
[11:32] <Arwen> lupine_85, do say - do you use Xgl or AIGLX?
[11:32] <lupine_85> Arwen: yeah. http://www.beryl-project.org/release/013notes.php
[11:32] <Tschaka> LordUltimaDavid kopete?
[11:32] <yoshig3> alright well
[11:32] <yoshig3> I rebooted
[11:32] <lupine_85> I use nvidia 9xxx series
[11:32] <LordUltimaDavid> adaptr: isnt that kde?
[11:32] <Tschaka> works?
[11:32] <yoshig3> and.....it's still nice and laggy.
[11:32] <yoshig3> So...what now?
[11:33] <lupine_85> did you get a nvidia splash screen when X started?
[11:33] <yoshig3> Yeap
[11:33] <Arwen> lupine_85, I'm stuck with ATi - the open drivers work, but transparency spikes my CPU usage
[11:33] <yoshig3> You know, like when you scroll websites- it's laggy instead of fluid
[11:33] <pos69sum> ``if anyone has the time - i started a thread re: my problems w update-manager after upgrading to edgy http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=316947
[11:34] <lupine_85> hmm.. well, the driver's working fine
=== Deon|alt is now known as Deon
[11:34] <lupine_85> are you using firefox?
[11:34] <yoshig3> hmm....maybe Xgl will help?
[11:34] <yoshig3> Yeap, firefox
[11:34] <yoshig3> Ran fine in windows
[11:34] <yoshig3> on this exact comp
[11:34] <yoshig3> just switched to ubuntu lol
[11:34] <Arwen> yoshig3, Xgl will only slow you down...
[11:34] <lupine_85> I found firefox to be too slow :D
[11:34] <yoshig3> It shoudln't, it's drawing everything from my CPU at the moment
[11:34] <lupine_85> do any other programs go all laggy?
[11:35] <Arwen> lupine_85, I want kubuntu too... but I'd have to download it, lol
[11:35] <lupine_85> yoshig3: not quite that simple
[11:35] <ouroboros> Please anyone, UVC video knowledge?
[11:35] <yoshig3> Well, it's just the drawing that is laggy
[11:35] <Gun_Smoke> Linux doesn't use FAT32 does it?
[11:35] <Arwen> lupine_85, is he using beryl? that tends to make scrolling slow
[11:35] <lupine_85> don't think so
[11:35] <yoshig3> like if I open a text editor, and drag the window, it'll show multiple windows behind it until I stop and let go of the window.
[11:35] <yoshig3> You know, laggy windows
[11:35] <lupine_85> yeah, it shouldn't be doing that

[11:39] <Zunino> Hello. Is there an IRC channel where I could ask about setting up Firebird DBMS on Ubuntu?
[11:40] <Fredrik> Going to intall ubuntu again (had it efore) but I am am now thinking of maby I shuld install Kubunti, edu ubuntu or some other. Does anyone here have anny recomendations?
[11:41] <soundray> Zunino: without knowing the problem, it's hard to tell, but since you're here, why don't you try us first.
[11:41] <Music_Shuffle> Fredrik, what didn't you like about Ubuntu?
[11:41] <lupine_85> kubuntu ++ :)
[11:41] <Zunino> Thanks, soundray; I just wanted to make sure I wasn't going to ask off-topic questions.
[11:42] <robdeman> how can I tell apt-get to use a different mirror? some packages were missing form the Dutch mirror
[11:42] <Music_Shuffle> Kubuntu has always hated me. I just install Ubuntu and add on KDE.
[11:42] <LjL> i recommend lack of recommendations
[11:42] <Music_Shuffle> robdeman, sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:42] <vader> Music_Shuffle, that is all O do lol
[11:42] <LjL> gksudo even
[11:42] <LjL> weird that, though
[11:42] <Zunino> Well, the thing is it seems the FB packages are incomplete or are not doing the complete setup procedure.
[11:42] <Music_Shuffle> And change them to whatever.
[11:42] <soundray> robdeman: edit sources.list and replace all occurrences of nl. with (e.g.) de.
[11:43] <faLUCE> Hi, I can't find the conf file where it's set the default window manager...any idea?
[11:43] <soundray> Zunino: how have you tried to install firebird?
[11:43] <LordUltimaDavid> gaim stoped working "http://pastebin.ca/275983" is my pastebin of the readout
[11:43] <Fredrik> no i liked it, I just reorganized my harddrive with  1 NTFS (windows XP) and mot importent fixed so my strage partition was shanged to ext3 insted of NTFS so I could acees it from all OS. To do this i hade to sacrefice my ubuntu partition to make some bacus from my storage device
[11:43] <cafuego_> faLUCE: it's not in a config file (muaha)
[11:43] <Zunino> The packages I installed were: firebird2-super-server, firebird2-server-common and firebird2-utils-super
[11:43] <Zunino> Via apt-get
[11:43] <faLUCE> cafuego, and where is it??
[11:43] <Zunino> The installation went OK. It asked me for the sysdba password
[11:43] <cafuego_> faLUCE: sudo update-alternatives --config x-window-manager
[11:44] <Zunino> I set one and it all seemed to have worked fine.
[11:44] <faLUCE> cafuego, already tried
[11:44] <Synesthesia> I have a really easy one for you guys -- the ubuntu docs say that I can edit the Document root in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. But there is *not* a DocumentRoot line there, nor a RedirectMatch line to uncomment. Any suggestions?
[11:44] <robdeman> what would be an alternative to nl.archive.ubuntu.com
[11:44] <cafuego_> faLUCE: It's managed via symbolic links in /etc/alternatives
[11:44] <robdeman> its missing ubuntu-desktop packages
[11:44] <faLUCE> unfortunately, when i reboot it starts always with kde
[11:44] <cafuego_> robdeman: anoy other two letter country code .archive.ubuntu.com
[11:44] <lupine_85> robdeman: just archive.ubuntu.com ...
[11:44] <Zunino> However, as I tried to run ISQL, it would simply dump a sort of instruction screen.
[11:44] <lupine_85> or use de. or gb. or us. or cz. or whatever, really :)
[11:45] <Music_Shuffle> faLUCE, on the login screen, click the option tab in the bottom right, select 'Session', change to whatever, and follow the prompts to make it your default.
[11:45] <faLUCE> but i've tried it, and it shows me that icewm is the default w-manager
=== Synesthesia is now known as Molly_156
[11:45] <Zunino> I could not get to the actual interactive command prompt as I saw on several on-line references.

[11:45] <robdeman> aargh
[11:45] <cloom> my name is Zunino too :D
[11:45] <majestik>  can i remove fisically an ide disk from my pc while its on if its umounted, or that would be stupid?
[11:45] <robdeman> how does VI save / exit
[11:45] <majestik> robdeman ctrl + w
[11:45] <soundray> Zunino: if fb is anything like mysql, you will have to install a client package in order to access the database server.
[11:45] <Zunino> Really, cloom? :-) Where are you from?
[11:45] <sire1> is it true that bazaar is another concurrent version system?
[11:46] <psusi> robdeman: :wq
[11:46] <cloom> I am from France
[11:46] <faLUCE> cafuego, any idea about?
[11:46] <Music_Shuffle> faLUCE, did you try what I just said?
[11:46] <majestik> robdeman, : w for saving, : q for quitting
[11:46] <majestik>  can i remove fisically an ide disk from my pc while its on if its umounted, or that would be stupid?
[11:46] <faLUCE> Music, what you said is not what I'm searching for
[11:47] <robdeman> is it CTRL-W or CTRL then W
[11:47] <Zunino> Hum... Soundray, but have you ever managed to install Firebird successfully? I have been able to install MySQL (only had some trouble with a bug in the Admin GUI tool, but nothing major).
[11:47] <GNU\colossus> robdeman: neither.
[11:47] <GNU\colossus> :w saves
[11:47] <kudzubane> majestik: i would not take the risk, but it should be fine
[11:47] <soundray> majestik: the specifications do not support hot swap on IDE. You *might*, with a little luck, get away with it anyhow.
[11:47] <GNU\colossus> :wq saves & exits
[11:47] <GNU\colossus> so does ZZ
[11:47] <cafuego_> robdeman: ctrl+W
[11:47] <soundray> Zunino: no, I haven't.
[11:47] <robdeman> is it :z or CTR-W ?
[11:47] <cafuego_> Oh, in vim.
[11:48] <cafuego_> in vim it's :wq or :ZZ or :x
[11:48] <soundray> Zunino: lack of a command line client aside, have you any indication that the packages haven't installed properly?
[11:48] <Zunino> Yes.
[11:48] <soundray> Zunino: perhaps run 'sudo apt-get -f install' and see if it generates any error messages.
[11:48] <soundray> Zunino: put them on the pastebin if there are any.
[11:48] <soundray> !pastebin | Zunino
[11:49] <ubotu> Zunino: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:49] <Zunino> I noticed an error on the log, which referred to a /var/run/firebird2 directory which had not been created.
[11:49] <Zunino> OK. I will start the whole thing over.
[11:49] <axisme> I have something very important to tell you all...
[11:49] <soundray> Zunino: nono
[11:49] <axisme> MACs SUCK
[11:49] <axisme> :-)
[11:49] <Zunino> I have just done a "complete removal" of every FB-related package.
[11:49] <Zunino> Too late :-)
[11:49] <soundray> Zunino: just run 'sudo apt-get -f install' literally
[11:49] <axisme> glad i got that out of my system
[11:50] <adaptr> majestik: is your hard drive burning yet ? :)
[11:50] <soundray> Zunino: why do you bother asking for help if you do something other than is being suggested?
[11:50] <gwood> I am following the instuctions for installing wine on 6.10, but I don't think there are any repositories for amd64?
[11:50] <magic_ninja> hey does anyone know how to use a laptop to connect regular monitor to a PC
[11:50] <Zunino> Sorry, I had already removed the packaged before I came here.
[11:50] <soundray> gwood: of course there are.
[11:51] <soundray> Zunino: okay, start over then
[11:51] <soundray> gwood: no, there is no wine for amd64
[11:51] <soundray> gwood: you can install the 32bit version, though, by following Kilz's instructions on the forums

[11:53] <TaTiKa> kira hi
[11:53] <majestik> ill not take the risk tho
[11:54] <kira> Can somebody tell me --> it is better to use SID or Edgy ?
[11:54] <Music_Shuffle> majestik, prolly the best idea.
[11:54] <soundray> livingdaylight: do you want to talk about it some other place?
[11:54] <livingdaylight> soundray, you said you were too busy to help me but you were not too busy to make all these comments
[11:54] <livingdaylight> soundray, i've said what i have to say...

[11:54] <adaptr> soundray is speaking ex-colonially here

[11:55] <soundray> adaptr: I've offered to take it elsewhere, but I think we're finished, anyhow.
[11:56] <Zunino> OK. I have run 'sudo apt-get install firebird2-super-server firebird2-examples'
[11:56] <adaptr> soundray: then either ban him or i'l ljust ignore
[11:57] <soundray> adaptr: I have no banning privilege.
[11:57] <livingdaylight> soundray, hahaha, it illustrates who you are! if you had just answered that is simple, but you ask if i want to hear it, so i check whether it is a rhetorical question and call your bluff and say 'no' and then you can triumphantly give your last word of condemnation and contempt anyway!
[11:57] <Zunino> This also installed: firebird2-common, firebird2-server-common, libfbclient1
[11:57] <ColonelZarkawi> soundray, livingdaylight: nobody gives a heck about your personal issues, this is a technical channel, I will ignore you both from now

[11:58] <Cyllene> unable to load certificate
[11:58] <Cyllene> 20824:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:644:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE
[11:58] <ubun> how can i watch .mov's (quicktime) in ubuntu?
[11:58] <Cyllene> Anyone know what is wrong?
[11:58] <Ryan`> I'm trying to install 6.10
[11:58] <ColonelZarkawi> right, thanks.
[11:58] <Ryan`> for whatever reason, I cannot resize my NTFS partition.
[11:58] <Music_Shuffle> LjL wins. Anyways...onwards.
[11:58] <Cyllene> Music_Shuffle: Do you know?
[11:58] <Ryan`> tried downloading and using Partition Magic, it also couldn't resize, or create a new partition
[11:59] <Ryan`> anyone know what I can do?
[11:59] <Music_Shuffle> No sorry, I've never had that error with FF.
[11:59] <Music_Shuffle> Ryan`, you can't with GParted?
[11:59] <Ryan`> Music_Shuffle: nope. I originall tried to with manual partitioning, it gave me an undisclosed error
[12:00] <compengi> how to create a new directory in the terminal
[12:00] <s777> hi
[12:00] <Cyllene> Music_Shuffle: Since when did I say it was an error with Firefox?
[12:00] <Ryan`> tried allowing gparted to create partitions on its own, all it did was think about doing it.
[12:00] <tonyyarusso> compengi: 'mkdir'
[12:00] <Music_Shuffle> You didn't.  But if I didn't completely miss your issue, its with security certificates on sites?
[12:00] <compengi> tyvm tonyyarusso
[12:01] <Cyllene> Music_Shuffle: No. I am trying to sign a CSR.
[12:01] <Music_Shuffle> Just kidding then. :)
