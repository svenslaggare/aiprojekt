[12:01] <Ryan`> Music_Shuffle: any idea what I can do?
[12:01] <GaiaX11> Ryan, make a backup of your files, format your HD again and install everything again.
[12:01] <Cyllene> Music_Shuffle: any idea what I can do?
[12:01] <D00B3Y`> after I installed XGL on a new hard drive,my desktop changed from all nice and round to windows 2000.
[12:01] <Ryan`> GaiaX11: thats a huge job, and I dont see how that could help?
[12:01] <D00B3Y`> here's a screenshot: http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/1108/screenshot1by1.png
[12:02] <Music_Shuffle> No to neither of you actually. GaiaX11's idea might work for Ryan` though. =/
[12:02] <D00B3Y`> how can I change it back? I tried going into themes but no luck, even when running metacity and not beryl
[12:03] <Arwen> yay, switching to main beryl mirrors reveals v0.1.3! the connection seems flaky though - maybe a bandwidth shortage?
[12:03] <GaiaX11> Ryan I had the same problem some months ago and did not manage with partition magic, gparted etc... And I had to do the huge job again :-)
[12:03] <oxbat> hello
[12:03] <D00B3Y`> In themes I also clicked in theme details but no luck there either
[12:04] <Ryan`> GaiaX11: so thats what you had to do eh?

[12:05] <lovloss> does anyone know how to enable Kino to import avi/mpegs and such?

[12:05] <D00B3Y`> thats another screenshot
[12:05] <D00B3Y`> you can notice better on the other one, so square, grey, and null
[12:05] <GaiaX11> Ryan Yes. But if you manage to resise it. Good luck!
[12:05] <Toran> Hey guys, does anyone know how to overclock a usb poll rate to like 1000hz? I want to increase mouse accuracy for gaming
[12:06] <Tschaka^> D00B3Y` its some kind of window decoration
[12:06] <Toran> I know you can do it in windows, but I haven't found anything on linux
[12:06] <dave> hey guys, whats the command to open GNOME?
[12:06] <D00B3Y`> Tschaka^: where is it?
[12:06] <Tschaka^> when you click on theme details, you should can change it
[12:06] <guzza> Question : How to revert the ubuntu to the starting install....meaning removing all additional software that was installed
[12:06] <D00B3Y`> I went through every theme there...
[12:06] <D00B3Y`> still looked all square
[12:06] <guzza> And i dont care about my data
[12:07] <Tschaka^> gimme a sec
[12:07] <drkm> honey I'm home!!!
[12:07] <D00B3Y`> see how it is all old?: http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/1108/screenshot1by1.png
[12:07] <Farm_Fresh> I'm trying to copy a folder from my desktop to another users home folder.. I'm doing (from location of dir) sudo cp Name /home/name but I'm getting cp: omitting directory Name   What am I doing wrong?
[12:07] <guzza> the problem is that my cd rom broke down and cant do a fresh install
[12:07] <Tschaka^> dave sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[12:07] <dave> thank you!
[12:07] <Loevborg> Is it possible to install ubuntu on a box with less than 256 MB RAM anyway?
[12:07] <guzza> @Loevborh yes it is
[12:07] <burner> Farm_Fresh: cp -R
[12:07] <Loevborg> The desktop CD seems to have problems.
[12:07] <AngryElf> what would cause the liveCD to freeze at "mounting root filesystem"?
[12:07] <tonyyarusso> Loevborg: With the alternate CD it is
[12:07] <guzza> You can use Xubuntu
[12:07] <Arwen> Toran, err... I assume you'd increase the power to the usb port and change a motherboard setting - I don't know if there's an app in linux though - do tell though, what game are you playing? I was under the impression there were no good ones that ran on linux
[12:07] <Farm_Fresh> burner:  What is that tag?
[12:08] <burner> Farm_Fresh: man cp
[12:08] <guzza> but i personally installed a friend of mine on a 233mhz with 64mb ram an gnome desktop ubuntu
[12:08] <Nego> hmm, just somewhat new to linux, just installed ubuntu on my laptop, but firefox seems to have some dns problems, takes like 10sec before it actually starts loading a page, any tips?
[12:08] <Arwen> guzza, pop an install cd in, wipe your partitions, install
[12:08] <Arwen> Loevborg, yes - I'd recommend an alternate install disc though
[12:08] <Loevborg> tonyyarusso, I thought 224MB would be sufficient...
[12:08] <eilker> !ssl
[12:08] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[12:08] <Tschaka^> D00B3Y` click on theme details, then the 2nd tab (should be window frame or something) and there choose one thing
[12:08] <Tschaka^> this should actually change it.
[12:08] <tonyyarusso> Loevborg: It might be possible, but it won't be fun to run a live cd on that.
[12:08] <D00B3Y`> k let me try one sec
[12:09] <guzza> Loevborg: Use XUBUNTU with XFCE .. little less pretty but faster then anything else on weaker machines
[12:09] <Tschaka^> btw i had it running xubuntu on an 500 mhz with 192 ram, worked fine...
[12:09] <Arwen> !info libssl
[12:09] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[12:09] <guzza> Loevborg: and dont use live cd to install it because you want be able to load it
[12:09] <Loevborg> guzza, it's not a weak machine though! it's a 2Ghz p4..
[12:09] <Farm_Fresh> burner:  Ok, well its a big file so a blanking cursor means its working?
[12:09] <GaiaX11> AngryElf: In boot time?
[12:09] <Tschaka^> bit slowly, but worked, also ff with flash sites and stuff ;] 
[12:10] <guzza> Loevborg : then i recomen ubuntu
[12:10] <guzza> Loevborg : with gnome desktop
[12:10] <FSRxc> Why does my x server freeze immediately after boot up with nvidia drivers installed?
[12:10] <guzza> Loevborg: but when it comes to gnome xfce and kde the RAM is what matters
[12:10] <Arwen> tonyyarusso, running a livecd is never fun - preloading all of ubuntu takes like 4GB RAM. And if you don't preload, the disc drive makes things veeeeeeery slow
[12:10] <factboy818181> can i kill the process bonobo-activation-server?
[12:11] <guzza> anywars QUESTION : HOW TO REVERT TO ORIGINAL INSTALL WITH TERMINAL ??
[12:11] <Arwen> Loevborg, if you have 256M RAM - that *is* a weak machine
[12:11] <tonyyarusso> Arwen: True, but some newer machines are at least fun enough to bear for the install process, sometimes.  (I use the alternate myself)

[12:12] <lupine_85> guzza: put install cd in drive; type "sudo reboot"
[12:12] <D00B3Y`> Tschaka: no luck

[12:12] <Tschaka^> :x
[12:12] <guzza> lupine_85: thats the problem ... i dont have an CD ROM :D
[12:12] <Tschaka^> strange...
[12:12] <FSRxc> I followed the ubuntu guide on installing drivers
[12:12] <LjL> eilker: uhm, i dunno... i have it, but then i have [had]  some gnome programs installed i suppose
[12:12] <lupine_85> ah
[12:12] <guzza> it broke dwon
[12:12] <guzza> down
[12:12] <lupine_85> then any of

[12:13] <factboy818181> anyway know if bonobo-activation-server can be killed?
[12:13] <lupine_85> USB drive, for instance

[12:13] <martin__> hi all
[12:13] <FSRxc> tried sudo nvidia-glx-config enable and it didn't work
[12:13] <eilker> LjL: thanx anyway...
[12:13] <Arwen> tonyyarusso, true - the livecd should preload the installer though.... since most people just install with it, that'd shave a few seconds
[12:13] <Arwen> lupine_85, don't you mean sudo shutdown -r now?
[12:13] <D00B3Y`> The windows themselves change, but not the whole thing
[12:13] <D00B3Y`> buttons are still square, window icons are still square etc.
[12:13] <Tschaka^> oooh i see
[12:13] <lupine_85> no
[12:13] <Arwen> question - on a system that can't boot from CD (yea yea....), is it possible to bootstrap with a floppy?
[12:14] <lupine_85> sudo reboot
[12:14] <Tschaka^> D00B3Y` then change window content, and symbols/icons too?
[12:14] <Arwen> lupine_85, that works? w00t!
[12:14] <D00B3Y`> Tried it too
[12:14] <Tschaka^> in the other tabs
[12:14] <Tschaka^> :x
[12:14] <martin__> is this this the right place to ask a newbe question
[12:14] <lupine_85> Arwen: yeah. any floppy-based deb-based distro + debootstrap
[12:14] <Music_Shuffle> Sure.
[12:14] <guzza> martin__ : Yes
[12:14] <romano2k> good evening! anyone able to tell me how to get good rights to get Kino working with my DV cam?
[12:14] <Tschaka^> martin__ it is ^^
[12:14] <Music_Shuffle> martibs, this is the right place to ask any Ubuntu-related question.
[12:14] <D00B3Y`> Tschaka^, I tried everything
[12:15] <drkm> btw
[12:15] <D00B3Y`> as in every tab

[12:15] <blanky> hey guys
[12:15] <blanky> what's a good way to compress a file into 7z
[12:15] <guzza> use automatix2 it's even easier with that :D
[12:15] <tonyyarusso> !automatix | guzza
[12:15] <Arwen> lupine_85, does it have to be debian based?
[12:15] <Tschaka^> D00B3Y` sry, dunnoo...
[12:15] <Ubotwo> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[12:16] <guzza> automatix2 when properly managed is a good piece of software
[12:16] <Music_Shuffle> !worksforme
[12:16] <tonyyarusso> guzza: You're free to have that opinion for yourself, but don't claim so here please.
[12:16] <Ubotwo> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[12:16] <drkm> :))
[12:16] <Arwen> blanky, apt-get install p7zip-full - then run 7z a 7zarchivename.7z filenames.foo
[12:16] <FSRxc> guzza, how do you suggest I configure the conf?
[12:16] <gnomefreak> guzza: if you want to advise people to use automatix join #automatix as it is not supported by ubuntu
[12:16] <blanky> thanks Arwen :)
[12:16] <martin__> i installed ubuntu on my pc (amd 64, a8v-vm) and solved the known sound-problem, but i still have problem with the graphics
[12:17] <guzza> FSRxc: what are your system specs?
[12:17] <drkm> :)
[12:17] <D00B3Y`> does anyone else know?
[12:17] <D00B3Y`> here is the screenshot: http://img329.imageshack.us/img329/3276/screenshotue0.png
[12:17] <guzza> gnomefreak : ok easy now...we're all on the same side here :D
[12:17] <D00B3Y`> Here is another one: http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/1108/screenshot1by1.png
[12:17] <D00B3Y`> you can notice it is all square and grey and null
[12:17] <D00B3Y`> therefore ugly
[12:17] <D00B3Y`> and unwanted
[12:17] <Arwen> blanky, np - btw, 7zip runs perfectly under wine at acceptable speed
[12:18] <blanky> Arwen: it's not native linux?
[12:18] <gnomefreak> guzza: easy == dont advise automatix in the *ubuntu channels
[12:18] <FSRxc> AMD Athlon XP 2500, 512 ram
[12:18] <FSRxc> I installed using the 386 cd
[12:18] <Dheeraj_1> hello does vanilla kernel support ntfs read/write?
[12:18] <guzza> gnomefreak: interesting ... i can advise ubuntu everywhere (open source) and not automatix (open source)?
[12:18] <Arwen> blanky, the gui isn't
[12:18] <aimtrainer> hi! I have a Samsung x11 carl with an nvidia videocard and have some trouble to use the external monitor with a seperate xscreen. I opened the nvidia-seetings in console and here is the output when I try to have it write the settings to the x config file: http://pastebin.ca/276013 Can anyone help me please?
[12:19] <D00B3Y`> can anyone help me?
[12:19] <FSRxc> But when I installed restricted modules, I used linux-restricted-modules-k7
[12:19] <guzza> gnomefreak: is the OSS finally getting to the point where everything is equal but something is more equal?
[12:19] <gnomefreak> guzza: dont advise it in here. if you do you will be removed
[12:19] <blanky> Arwen: oh okay
[12:19] <D00B3Y`> I've even asked in the forums but no one can help me
[12:19] <LjL> guzza: i'm not so sure automatix is open source. anyway, this is the official Ubuntu channels - there are things we recommend, and things we recommend against. #ubuntu-offtopic to further the discussion if you like
[12:19] <Arwen> blanky, and p7zip has a couple bugs here and there - but other than that, it works fine
[12:19] <blanky> Arwen: oh okay thanks sir
[12:19] <gnomefreak> LjL: got tired of being pinged lol
[12:19] <guzza> gnomefreak: so what would you advise for a beginner that doesnt make difference from his mouse and his terminal?
[12:20] <Music_Shuffle> To ask in here? Or use the wiki?
[12:20] <Dheeraj_1> does vanilla kernel support ntfs read/write?
[12:20] <Music_Shuffle> None of the stuff needs a rocket scientist to install.
[12:20] <D00B3Y`> anyone please?
[12:20] <Arwen> see, gnomefreak is kinda like a bot - do this, don't do that...... guzza, automatix is OSS, but some OSS works better than other OSS
[12:20] <gnomefreak> guzza: either get the stuff he needs from codecs or feel free to ask him to join #automatix and advise it there. it will not be supported in official ubuntu channels at all
[12:20] <kitche> Dheeraj_1: well it can read ntfs just not write it not sure if write support is in the latest release of 2.6.19
[12:21] <guzza> FSRxc: if you followed the guide to installing nvidia it should work nicely but there is a problem with the new nvidia drivers thath come with edgy
[12:21] <gnomefreak> repos not codecs
[12:21] <martin__> i have problems with my graphics under ubuntu 6.10 (amd64), can anyanybody help me?
[12:21] <guzza> FSRxc: so check which nvidia drivers you got
[12:21] <LjL> Arwen: if it's OOS, then why do i only seem to be able to obtain some *compiled* (bytecode) Python scripts?
[12:21] <LjL> OSS even
[12:21] <gnomefreak> Arwen: the source is not readily avalible
[12:21] <D00B3Y`> Here is the screenshot again: http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/1108/screenshot1by1.png

[12:22] <FSRxc> I'm still on dapper
[12:22] <blanky> ?
[12:22] <blanky> I did that and it said 'incorrect command line'
[12:22] <Joe_> Hi
[12:23] <D00B3Y`> please someone help me...
[12:23] <Tschaka^> D00B3Y`
[12:23] <D00B3Y`> ?
[12:23] <Joe_> Is this open question chat?
[12:23] <Tschaka^> tried to click on install themes
[12:23] <FSRxc> guzza: how do I determine what version of the driver I have?
[12:23] <Tschaka^> and chosen on of that?
[12:23] <guzza> gnomefreak: i'm not a representative from ubuntu so when i tell someone to do something it doesnt imply that im right
[12:23] <gnomefreak> Joe_: support for ubuntu only
[12:23] <guzza> FSRxc: what is your graphic card?
[12:23] <Joe_> Yes, but I don't have to wait for someone to say ask? :-p
[12:23] <D00B3Y`> where do I get themes from? gnome-look is fine yes?
[12:23] <FSRxc> GeForce FX5700LE
[12:24] <kitche> !ask|Joe_
[12:24] <Ubotwo> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:24] <Joe_> I just wanted to know how to install ubuntu off the ubuntu cd straight from boot, rather than starting up.
[12:24] <gnomefreak> guzza: you have been warned. you will do it one of 2 ways either advise it and risk being removed or not advise it and teach people how to do it the officcla ubuntu way since you are in an official ubuntu support channel.
[12:24] <gnomefreak> automatix is very much offtopic for this channel
[12:24] <guzza> FSRxc: and your ubuntu? hoary? dapper? breezy? edgy?
[12:24] <FSRxc> dapper
[12:24] <kitche> Joe_: you probably want the alternative cd since the desktop-install is livecd
[12:25] <Joe_> I ordered them from..
[12:25] <Joe_> Shipit..
[12:25] <Joe_> 6.06lts.
[12:25] <gnomefreak> Joe_: you have to boot to cd to install it
[12:25] <Tschaka^> D00B3Y` just click within the themes window on install themes
[12:25] <gnomefreak> if you use the cd
[12:25] <guzza> FSRxc: have you folowed this guide :  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29
[12:25] <Joe_> darn, theres no command i can enter?
[12:25] <adaptr> I have a hoary breezy edgy dapper drake
[12:25] <FSRxc> guzza: I used this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[12:26] <gnomefreak> Joe_: on the alternate cd you can but livecd you cant and thats all shipit ships anymore
[12:26] <Joe_> okay.,
[12:26] <Joe_> so I will have to download and burn as iso?
[12:26] <lupine_85> Arwen: not really, but it helps if it is
[12:26] <D00B3Y`> Tschaka^, opens a file browser window
[12:26] <tonyyarusso> Joe_: Correct
[12:26] <gnomefreak> Joe_: the alternatve cd yes
[12:26] <lupine_85> as long as it's got the debootstrap command, you're good to go
[12:26] <Tschaka^> yeah...download some good lockin
[12:26] <Joe_> Okay.
[12:26] <Tschaka^> lookin* and try with them
[12:26] <Joe_> I might as well get the 10...

[12:28] <Tschaka^> could told us before :p
[12:28] <ompaul> dave, System Administration Networking
[12:28] <D00B3Y`> I did, but it shouldnt be

[12:52] <bashir> well beryl is a fork of compiz
[12:52] <bashir> novel
[12:52] <bashir> ya they "invented" it

=== cappicard_ is now known as cappicard
[12:58] <Arwen> D00B3Y`, that is a truly unusual problem... never seen anything like it
[12:58] <fatalcure> robdeman: System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop, and install a VNC client on your XP box
[12:58] <Arwen> D00B3Y`, oh wait... I was just zoomed out, nvm
[12:58] <Arwen> D00B3Y`, I've seen that before, run gnome-settings-daemon
[12:58] <yuv656> tonyyarusso: thanks
[12:58] <bashir> doesnt seem like a problem to me
[12:58] <robdeman> fatalcure: yeah but VNC will onlyu work when the local user is logged in right?
[12:58] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: It's stuck there, it won't let me go on in the setup
[12:59] <robdeman> fatalcure: shouldnt I use Xming?
[12:59] <drkm> is there a way I can change the size of the icons on my desktop and in my folder list etc?
[12:59] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: It's saying " Users of PowerPC machines, and users of any computer with multiple video....."
[01:00] <xzela> Arwen: Does gnome-settings-daemon restart X?
[01:00] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: and it has the <Ok>, but I can't continue, no matter how many times I press enter.
[01:00] <Arwen> xzela, no....
[01:00] <Arwen> xzela, wasn't talking to you though, so beware
[01:00] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: have to hit ESC XD
[01:00] <xzela> Arwen: I know, i was just wondering why D00B3y left
[01:01] <fatalcure> robdeman: yes, that's true.  Another method is to install a VNC Server, then you can either ssh in to start a server process, or set up the XDMCP (sp?).  I don't know a lot about the latter though.
[01:01] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: hit tab once
[01:01] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: does <ok> turn red?
[01:01] <Arwen> xzela, same... could be a coincidence
[01:01] <Arwen> or maybe xgl just crashed
[01:01] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: I got it, but it says "PCI:0:2:0" Should I change that to PCI:01:00:0?
[01:01] <shwag> where are instructions on setting my mysql root password?
[01:01] <robdeman> fatalcure: how would I install a VNC server?
[01:01] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: yes
[01:02] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: did it say a few pages back nvidia crad?
[01:02] <fatalcure> robdeman: vnc4server, tightvncserver and vncserver are in Universe
[01:02] <fatalcure> !vnc
[01:02] <ubotu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[01:02] <fatalcure> !vncfix
[01:02] <ubotu> If you are getting errors like "could not open default font 'fixed'" when running a VNC server: 'sudo ln -s /usr/share/X11/fonts /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts'
[01:02] <yoshig3> gamefreak: yes, I entered my card info. It showed "Generic Graphics Card" at first till I fixed it.
[01:02] <robdeman> fatalcure: I m a newbie, is there a command to install? which one is best and what is Universe?
[01:02] <fatalcure> robdeman: ^^^^ (a couple of things to note)
[01:02] <Digitally> i understand that ubuntu works better for wireless
[01:03] <Digitally> is that true?
[01:03] <robdeman> ok
[01:03] <fatalcure> robdeman: use synaptic (System -> Admin menu)
[01:03] <fatalcure> !universe | robdeman

[01:04] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: change the . to a :
[01:04] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: so just enter PCI:01:00:0??
[01:04] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: alright brb
[01:04] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: yes the config file doesnt read . as the same as lspci
[01:05] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: I'm about to set it as "PCI:01:00:0" this right?
[01:05] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: yes
[01:05] <PPAAUULL> Ok Here is the problem. When I try to play games like ET the mouse movement lags by a little less then a second and it is really hard to play. Is there anyway to fix this?
[01:06] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: for RAM, should I put "128000"?
[01:06] <BixBuster> hi all
[01:06] <Panagant> hi yall
[01:06] <robdeman> could'nt find package tightvncserver  ?
[01:06] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: whatever it asks for if it asks for anything other than mb please do the math for it
[01:06] <fatalcure> robdeman: this looks good too - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=122402
[01:07] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: Yes I will lol, but is that right? or should I be showing something like 127128 or something
[01:07] <Arwen> yoshig3, nope - 128M does not equal 128 x 10^6
[01:07] <Arwen> and some will be reserved by parts of the system, so you won't see all
[01:07] <yoshig3> Arwen: well what does it equal ;.;
[01:07] <yoshig3> arwen: exactly so I don't know how much to put in without breaking something
[01:07] <Arwen> yoshig3, 128 x 2^20
[01:07] <PPAAUULL> anyone have any ideas?
[01:07] <Arwen> but you're likely missing some
[01:07] <fatalcure> robdeman: you need to enable the Universe repository - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories
[01:08] <Arwen> PPAAUULL, you using wine?
[01:08] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: 128 time 1024 i think is the fomular

[01:08] <gnomefreak> times
[01:08] <PPAAUULL> No Native game
[01:08] <ColonelZarkawi> PPAAUULL, do you really play ET? The atari version?
[01:08] <Yuuki> I redirected my port 80 requests to port 8888 somehow, and now I can't remember how I did it.  Does anyone have any ideas?
[01:08] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: so 131072 ?
[01:08] <PPAAUULL> Enemy Territory
[01:08] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: 131072kb i think
[01:08] <ColonelZarkawi> ohhhhhh!!!!
[01:09] <Gnewf> i want to find/replace text in a PDF file; any way to do this using a *command line* tool?
[01:09] <PPAAUULL> lol
[01:09] <angel12> hey guys, for some reason my computer (running 6.10) locks up randomly, i cant trace it to any program. any ideas/ help?
[01:09] <ColonelZarkawi> hopefully is better than ET for atari
[01:09] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: there is 1024 byte in a kb and 1024 kb in a mb and so on
[01:09] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: yeah I know
[01:09] <ivx> hey i am trying to mount a device that has ext2 file system in ubuntu 6.10, do i need to install something to get this support
[01:09] <Arwen> PPAAUULL, heh - try adjusting your mouse drivers.... not sure what more you can do
[01:10] <ostrich> how can I determine who my dhcp server is?
[01:10] <Arwen> ivx, no - ext2 == ext3
[01:10] <fatalcure> ivx: no, should just work (tm)
[01:10] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: " Use kernel framebuffer device interface?" ??
[01:10] <fatalcure> ==?  i think not
[01:10] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: yes
[01:10] <ostrich> or who my dns is?
[01:10] <Arwen> what's the difference between gnome-xchat and xchat?
[01:10] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: nvidia can havndle fb
[01:10] <PPAAUULL> Ok I thought that too but I am not sure where to find the options for adjusting the drivers
[01:10] <PPAAUULL> Where can I find those?
[01:10] <n8k99> hi angelesw
[01:10] <angel12> any ideas on what could be locking up my computer guys?
[01:10] <gnomefreak> Arwen: not all that much anymore
[01:10] <Arwen> PPAAUULL, System -> Mouse I think....
[01:11] <itrebal> how can I get DivX support in Xine?
[01:11] <PPAAUULL> No driver options
[01:11] <ivx> well when i do sudo mount -t ext2 /dev/hda /backup i get an error that says, bad superblock and a whole bunch of stuff, whats going on
[01:11] <Arwen> gnomefreak, if I were to switch to the officially supported gnome-xchat, would I notice anything?
[01:11] <Arwen> itrebal, w32codecs... or just install VLC/MPlayer
[01:11] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: XKB rule to use is xorg right?
[01:11] <gnomefreak> Arwen: depends what version of xchat you were used to
[01:11] <Arwen> ivx, you need to fsck, your partition is BROKEN
[01:11] <yoshig3> intrebal: VLC is great
[01:11] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: yes the defaults should be fine til the end
[01:11] <Arwen> gnomefreak, latest, why?
[01:11] <fatalcure> ivx: you need a partition numbereg.  /dev/hda3  (note the 3)
[01:11] <Wiseguy> ivx, you have to specify a partition, you are choosing the whole drive
[01:12] <PPAAUULL> Anyone know where I can adjust the mouse drivers and such?
[01:12] <Arwen> ivx, oh yea... you forgot the partition number, lol
[01:12] <Arwen> sorry, don't fsck
[01:12] <fatalcure> ...
[01:12] <ColonelZarkawi> PPAAUULL, in the xorg.conf file
[01:12] <Arwen> PPAAUULL, try System -> Prefs > Mouse...
[01:12] <gnomefreak> Arwen: prior to 6.6 or 6.8 it looked normal now they look the same
[01:12] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: do I want pc104?
[01:12] <itrebal> Arwen: thanks
[01:12] <raintheory> okay so im writing a small sh script that alternates between 2 xorg.conf files...  works great but how can i get it to restart gdm without putting me at a command line login?
[01:12] <ivx> i am trying to mount a whole drive, and it is good i just had a computer booted from it a minute ago, i took it out and need to copy files over
[01:12] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: if your in usa yes
[01:12] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: I have "super" on my keyboard
[01:12] <Wiseguy> ivx, then you choose /dev/hda1
[01:12] <sandy16> my session is closing when i open my openoffice, how can i avoid it?
[01:12] <PPAAUULL> Arwen I told you there are no drivers there!!!
[01:13] <Arwen> ivx, to mount a whole drive, you have to mount each partitions manually...
[01:13] <Arwen> PPAAUULL, sorry - xorg.conf then
[01:13] <FSRxc> gnomefreak: everytime I run sudo nvidia-glx-config enable, it configures the card as a ATI card, what gives?
[01:13] <ostrich> is there a bonjour client for linux?

[01:13] <Arwen> !caps > ivx
[01:13] <raintheory> lemme add that and try
[01:13] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: do I want ImPS/2 or explorer?
[01:13] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, don't abuse ubotu thanks
[01:13] <FSRxc> I see
[01:14] <ostrich> yeah, I know cups rocks, but my office network is using bonjour, so I'm hunting
[01:14] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: whatever the default one is set to
[01:14] <AngryElf>  what's the app that will cache ubunutu deb's to my local server so i dont have to dl them everytime i need them?
[01:14] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, I'm not
[01:14] <toastytaco> Thanks I will look to see....
[01:14] <fatalcure> Arwen: c'mon, he was happy :)
[01:14] <Arwen> fatalcure, lol
[01:14] <ivx> arwem, it was a happy thing, not angry, i thought there would be no problem with that
[01:14] <Arwen> ivx, :-P
[01:14] <Arwen> still ALL CAPS, lol
[01:14] <ColonelZarkawi> Arwen, I told you, don't argue. Just don't abuse of that feature. Thanks.
[01:14] <mt3> Hi people
[01:14] <Arwen> ColonelZarkawi, I wasn't abusing it!
[01:14] <mt3> Ok I have a bit of a situation here
[01:14] <fatalcure> a little overzealous perhaps
[01:14] <ivx> arwen, i was very happy
[01:14] <ivx> :)
[01:15] <mt3> I've locked myself out of college for the night
[01:15] <Arwen> ivx, ok, apologies if I sounded a bit nazi
[01:15] <gnomefreak> Arwen: please watch your language
[01:15] <mt3> And... It's cold. But the real point is I have no CDs with me, and I need to have my laptop sorted out for notes tomorrow morning.
[01:15] <Arwen> gnomefreak, ........fine...............
[01:15] <mcquaid> anyone here use mythtv?
[01:15] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: "This option is recommended to experienced users only.  In most cases,     
[01:15] <yoshig3>   all of these modules should be enabled."
[01:15] <n8k99> hi angelesw
[01:15] <mt3> So I'm borrowing a friend's laptop right now which I'm downloading Ubuntu 5.10 on
[01:16] <angelesw> Hey n8k99
[01:16] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: what option?
[01:16] <mt3> Ok my question people: Is there any way at all I can install Ubuntu onto a machine over the network?
[01:16] <fatalcure> ooh, the "n" word.  hmm
[01:16] <hybrid> mt3: yes let me get the link
[01:16] <Arwen> mt3, with PXE.... but that's very difficult and you might as well take the hit
[01:16] <mt3> hybrid: That'd be really great thanks
[01:16] <jeff_tx> i have a problem switching to nvidia drivers.  the nvidia module won't install (modprobe)
[01:16] <cmt^^> I'm trying to watch movies on my TV with an ATI Radeon X700 SE in Ubuntu 6.10, and my image on the tv is offset to the left and top
[01:16] <yuv656> what is the shell command to display my processor name/speed?
[01:16] <cmt^^> what might be wrong?
[01:16] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: the x.org server modules that should load on default
[01:16] <tonyyarusso> yuv656: 'cat /proc/cpuinfo'
[01:16] <hybrid> mt3: http://mywheel.net/blog/index.php/ubuntu-network-install/
[01:16] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: which ones should I use and not use?
[01:16] <Arwen> cmt^^, you using fglrx?
[01:16] <yuv656> thx
[01:16] <cmt^^> Arwen - yup
[01:16] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: leave them the way they are
[01:17] <mt3> Thanks people
[01:17] <Arwen> cmt^^, that itself might be what's wrong, lol
[01:17] <GaiaX11> toastytaco: Dell belongs to "the dark power side". Why did you buy it. The best printers for open source are HP and Epson. Dell do not like supporting Open Source.
[01:17] <cmt^^> Arwen - i get output and everything
[01:17] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: ther eshould be a bunch checked included glx
[01:17] <cmt^^> but it's offset like i said
[01:17] <Arwen> cmt^^, hrmm.... no idea here - I avoid fglrx
[01:18] <cmt^^> Noone?
[01:18] <josh_> whats up people? how compatible is edgy with the conroe chip + intel 965 boards?
[01:18] <raintheory> okay invoke-rc.d gdm restart works but it restarts me at the command line login and i have to run startx after logging in to get back
[01:18] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: there are a few checked, I'm at the monitor part atm
[01:18] <Arwen> josh_, yes
[01:18] <Arwen> fully
[01:18] <matthew_w> Hey, I've been having problems with Java based applications since Edgy, is this a known issue, and is there a patch or a fix of some kind?
[01:18] <josh_> are there any quarks about edgy i should know about?
[01:18] <toastytaco> GaiaX11: Well I was using XP at the time and just a week ago I went straight to Linux...
[01:18] <drkm> how do i disable cups?
[01:18] <Arwen> josh_, nope, at least not CPU related
[01:18] <josh_> sata2 support?
[01:19] <fatalcure> raintheory: then it's not working.  It should bring up the login screen
[01:19] <raintheory> when i ctrl-alt-backspace it works just how i want it to...   puts me back at a graphical login after switching xorg.conf files...   any other way i can do this?
[01:19] <Arwen> drkm, sys > admin > services
[01:19] <FSRxc> How do I add different monitor refresh frequencies?
[01:19] <Arwen> josh_, full sata support, at least for intel mobos
[01:19] <jeff_tx> well at least the xorg NV driver works.  will use that until i figure out why i can't get the module to load
[01:19] <Arwen> josh_, do realize that most sata hdds are really pata with a converter built-in
[01:19] <Arwen> so don't expect to see great performance
[01:19] <josh_> yeah i know its not a scsi but its better then pata :P
[01:19] <GaiaX11> toastytaco: Now you know. Don't buy anything from Dell (computers, laptops, etc...)
[01:20] <drkm> Arwen: thanks
[01:20] <Arigato> how do I clear terminal history?
[01:20] <raintheory> i had this working before, but cant figure out what i did differently
[01:20] <josh_> GaiaX11: or macs...
[01:20] <josh_> Arigato: history clear
[01:20] <Arwen> josh_, the transport doesn't determine your hdds speed, the limiting factor is your actual hdd
[01:20] <Arwen> :-\
[01:21] <toastytaco> GaiaX11: Ohhh yea ...It is just hard to find good hardware and software support for linux....
[01:21] <cmt^^> what's a good forum to ask questions on ati and getting tv-output working?
[01:21] <raintheory> lemme try one more thing, brb
[01:21] <toastytaco> But I hate windows...
[01:21] <Arwen> GaiaX11, Dell isn't that bad... I have one here - good performance for the price
[01:21] <GaiaX11> josh_: That's right. If we don't buy from them. So, perhaps they will change their politics towards Open Source.
=== mcmahonm is now known as mcmahonm[A] 
[01:21] <Arwen> cheaper even if you get a Dell-N (N for no-windows)
[01:21] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: can I PM you with a few lines from my terminal? I just got done with the config

[01:23] <yoshig3> thanks arwen
[01:23] <toastytaco> GaiaX11: I had the pinter installed one time but it kept on telling me to put A4 paper into the tray insted of US Letter paper...And I had all the settings set to US letter...???any comments
[01:24] <GaiaX11> Arwen: They are changing, but it is still a long way. They are too nasty against open source. They like money as the "big guy" does
[01:24] <josh_> anyone managed to get windows media player 9 installed on thier linux box?
[01:24] <Arwen> GaiaX11, not really....
[01:24] <josh_> i need it for running some apps in wine
[01:24] <Arwen> GaiaX11, just because they don't provide linux support (they do support Red Hat) doesn't mean they're anti-oss
[01:24] <josh_> and who has firefox 2.0?
[01:25] <Arwen> josh_, me.... though the greatness is lost on me
[01:25] <mt3_> How does network boot work. I mean if I link two computers together, how do I boot from an ISO on the second machine assuming the first one supports network booting?
[01:25] <cntb> rotate nvidia mx200
[01:25] <Arwen> mt3, you need to mount the iso with special network boot software on one machine and then set the first one's bios to use PXE
[01:25] <josh_> me what Arwen? firefox or media player?
[01:25] <mhiku> does portage support php6? and apache 2.3-2.4 svn builds?
[01:25] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36513/
[01:26] <Arwen> josh_, firefox... WMP is junk in wine
[01:26] <Arwen> besides, there's good alternatives to WMP
[01:26] <josh_> yeah but i need it for certain wine compatible apps
[01:26] <mt3_> Arwen: I'm not sure if the first machine uses PXE? It has the ability to boot from the network in its bios settings. The machine on which the ISO is is a Macintosh....
[01:26] <fatalcure> mhiku: portage? perhaps you want #gentoo
[01:26] <GaiaX11> Arwen: i Think you have to read more about the subject. And Red Hat is not as open as some people think.
[01:26] <josh_> how did you get firefox installed?
[01:26] <fatalcure> josh_: Edgy has FF2
[01:26] <nomasteryoda> !firefoxo
[01:26] <Arwen> josh_, no - you need some libs from it, wine provides its own WMP libs
[01:27] <nomasteryoda> !firefox
[01:27] <josh_> i downloaded the tarbell but couldn't manage the install
[01:27] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about firefoxo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:27] <ubotu> firefox is the default web-browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion Installing plugins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxPlugins
[01:27] <Arwen> GaiaX11, err.... Red Hat is open, or at least all the FOSS parts are
[01:27] <hdibani> does anybody have a tutorial on how to run ldap server on ubuntu?
[01:27] <josh_> i have firefox, i want ff2
[01:27] <mhiku> i mean does ubuntu support php and apache svn builds?
[01:27] <josh_> but on still running dapper
[01:27] <Arwen> josh_, add the backports repos
[01:27] <Arwen> !repos | josh_
[01:27] <ubotu> josh_: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[01:28] <robdeman> heya all how do I open port 22 for SCP and stuff?
[01:28] <wimpies> Hi all, I need some help with my upgrade from dapper to edgy
[01:28] <fatalcure> robdeman: install the ssh package
[01:28] <robdeman> ah
[01:28] <gnomefreak> yoshig3: thats fine. it wrote it i think. im off for a while i have to eat dinner and go to store.
[01:28] <GaiaX11> Arwen: Ok. go on using Dell. Buy it and recommend it. And you will be helping FOSS. Ok?
[01:28] <robdeman> just ssh?
[01:28] <tonyyarusso> robdeman: Installing the ssh server will set it up to listen on that port automatically.  Make sure you have port forwarding in your router too, if applicable.
[01:28] <hdibani> openssh
[01:28] <wimpies> First I got this error trying to run bootclean.sh which no longer exists
[01:28] <robdeman> apt-get ssh?
[01:28] <wimpies> this happens while booting
[01:28] <fatalcure> robdeman: yep, it will bring the server (openssh-server) in with it
[01:28] <tonyyarusso> robdeman: (ssh is a metapackage - it will get all you need, so yes)
[01:28] <drkm> is there a way I can have my ctrl+v actually paste into terminal?
[01:28] <Arwen> GaiaX11, find me a manufacturer that uses FOSS as default - that's commercial suicide
[01:28] <robdeman> aah ok I understand
[01:28] <tonyyarusso> drkm: Ctrl-Shift-V
[01:28] <Music_Shuffle> drkm, ctrl+shift+v
[01:28] <wimpies> drkm : use middle mouse button
[01:29] <fatalcure> robdeman: sudo apt-get install ssh
[01:29] <hdibani> apt-get install openssh
[01:29] <kishan> hi can any one help i am unable to mount my swap pation
[01:29] <Arwen> GaiaX11, and you can install whatever OS you want
[01:29] <mt3_> Ok can anyone link me to anywhere I can learn about network booting a laptop off my Mac in a way that would allow the Mac to act like a CD for the laptop (which does support network booting) so I can install ubuntu from my Mac?
[01:29] <drkm> thanks
[01:29] <fatalcure> kishan: are you using the swapon command to do that?
[01:29] <josh_> where can i get a list of repos?
[01:29] <josh_> !easysources
[01:29] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[01:29] <josh_> ive already added these
[01:30] <wasp_ems> hello i am trying to mount an iso file can someone help? i am writing mount - t /source of file and when i press enter nothing happens..however if i try to add at then end a destination then i get a whole lot of commands like a manual
[01:30] <hdibani> is there an easy way to run openldap server on ubuntu?
[01:30] <Arwen> mt3, there's a #pxe
[01:30] <mt3_> I'll try in there, thanks
[01:30] <mt3_> #pxe
[01:30] <fatalcure> mt3_: there are a few install methods on the wiki, hopefully something there will help ...
[01:30] <fatalcure> !install | mt3_
[01:30] <ubotu> mt3_: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[01:31] <kitche> josh_: well what version of ubuntu you using since you just had to uncomment the lines in /etc/apt/source.list
[01:31] <cmt^^> no ideas on the ati + tv-out issue huh? where can i find a forum to ask in?
[01:31] <cmt^^> !forum
[01:31] <ubotu> The Ubuntu forums can be found at http://www.ubuntuforums.org
[01:31] <Arwen> cmt^^, ubuntuforums.org
[01:31] <cmt^^> :)
[01:31] <josh_> dapper
[01:32] <fatalcure> cmt^^: self service :)
[01:32] <Arwen> forums are over-rated though, I've been ignored a lot
[01:32] <Arwen> josh_, ?
[01:32] <yoshig3> gnomefreak: you still there? what do I do after this?
[01:32] <josh_> haven't went to edgy yet, i will once i build my new system in 4 days
[01:32] <yoshig3> Hey guys, I just got done doing xorg config, what do I do now?
[01:32] <robdeman> ah I really dumb Vi question.. qhen I enter : ... it actually shows a : instead of giving me the commandbox?
[01:33] <Arwen> josh_, you're building your own computer? nice
[01:33] <Arwen> yoshig3, reboot X
[01:33] <kitche> robdeman: you mean at the bottom of vim?
[01:33] <GaiaX11> Arwen: There isn't. But some are more friendly toward FOSS and others are much less. For example IBM, HP, Epson support FOSS.  Dell and Mac don't. So, instead of buying a Dell or Mac I would of course buy from the others. Dell computing market says: "We recommend WinXP"
[01:33] <josh_> yeah, its cheaper that way :P
[01:33] <fatalcure> robdeman: hit <ESC> to get out of insert mode
[01:33] <robdeman> kitche: yes?
[01:33] <yoshig3> arwen: alright, brb, gonna try
[01:33] <Panagant> hi yall
[01:33] <kitche> robdeman: that is the command box
[01:33] <Music_Shuffle> josh_, only for the upper end ;P
[01:33] <robdeman> kitche: It doesnt show up, itenters the :
[01:33] <kitche> robdeman: if it shows : at the bottom of vim that is the comamdn box then you do q to quit and w to write
[01:33] <Arwen> GaiaX11, and.... that would be a good thing for them to do
[01:33] <Nego> hmm, new to this but, I get an error when I tru to run a program, saying it's ownded by root but started as my username
[01:33] <peacekpr> anyone had a problem with gnome-cups-manager not starting in Edgy for AMD64?  I can't get gnome-cups-add or gnome-cups-manager to start!  I can access CUPS configuration via port 631, though
[01:34] <josh_> thats why i have to build it Music_Shuffle  :) dell cant compete
[01:34] <Music_Shuffle> Eww @ Dell. Definitely.
[01:34] <Music_Shuffle> I did the same. ^_^
[01:34] <Arwen> GaiaX11, you are free to order your Dell with FreeDOS instead of Windows. Or even RH
[01:34] <robdeman> kitche: I know but the point is, It does not show the commandbox, it insert a : in the text
[01:34] <kitche> robdeman: then hit esc
[01:34] <Arwen> although, Dell's windows installs do suck...
[01:34] <peacekpr> but i need to add a printer that is connected via usb to another edgy machine on the local network
[01:34] <kitche> robdeman: then press :wq to write and quit
[01:35] <peacekpr> in other words, the client computer won't start gnome-cups-manager... any ideas?
[01:35] <Arwen> GaiaX11, btw, there's no company called "man"
[01:35] <Arwen> "mac"*
[01:36] <robdeman> kiche: ok it worked
[01:36] <whyameye> how do I choose what user a cron job runs as?
[01:36] <GaiaX11> Arwen: Of course. But, normal people are overwhelmed by their marketing and even if they buy a PC with linux, they take the machine to someone and ask then to format the HD and install a XP there.
[01:37] <kitche> whyameye: you make the cronjob as that user
[01:37] <tonyyarusso> whyameye: By putting it in the correct crontab
[01:37] <fatalcure> whyameye: by running 'crontab -e' as that user
[01:37] <ryanakca> my apt keeps sigsev'ing... I filed a bug report about it with the number 75273... how can I fix it
[01:37] <Arwen> GaiaX11, and you have a problem with people choosing their OS? I use WinXP in addition to linux
[01:37] <kitche> !offtopic|GaiaX11, Arwen
[01:37] <ubotu> GaiaX11, Arwen: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[01:37] <yoshig3> alright well
[01:37] <yoshig3> Arwen: still laggy
[01:37] <Arwen> kitche, thank you.... that was unnecessary though
[01:37] <tim167> reproducable bug Openoffice Writer: copy a line of text, try to paste that into a Gaim conversation -> Openoffice Writer closes immediately! can anyone confirm this ?
[01:38] <Arwen> yoshig3, mm.... there are sacrifices involved in F/OSS, lol
[01:38] <kishan> Can any one help me with samba i am able to access my windows box from my ubuntu box but i am unable to access my ubuntu box from windows
[01:38] <yoshig3> Arwen: what?
[01:38] <fatalcure> !samba | kishan
[01:38] <Arwen> tim167, heh... I don't use Gaim or OO.o, so sorry
[01:38] <ubotu> kishan: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[01:38] <bjron> anyone know if there is a quick/easy way to temporarily disable the flash plugin from firefox?
[01:38] <GaiaX11> Arwen: Let's quit this subject. You stay with your Dell and Mac. :-P
[01:38] <brainsik> whyameye: /etc/crontab lets you specify a user
[01:38] <Arwen> yoshig3, nvm
[01:38] <brainsik> whyameye: # m h dom mon dow user    command
[01:38] <yoshig3> Arwen: it's still laggy though...the graphics
[01:38] <Arwen> GaiaX11, I don't have a mac... they suck (stopping though)
[01:38] <lubix> i am a RUSSIAN!!
[01:39] <yoshig3> windows still draw super slow
[01:39] <brainsik> whyameye: man 5 crontab
[01:39] <Arwen> yoshig3, hrmm.... you better ask someone else
[01:39] <yoshig3> garg
[01:39] <fatalcure> bjron: move libflashplayer.so out of /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[01:39] <yoshig3> Anyone having this problem? Windows are drawing slow and laggy when trying to drag
[01:39] <yoshig3> And they draw slow
[01:40] <bjron> fatalcure, good call, thanks :)
[01:40] <yoshig3> like minimizing or something
[01:40] <meshyf> yoshig3: Try updating graphics
[01:40] <fatalcure> bjron: np :)
[01:40] <Arwen> yoshig3, ah yes - what graphics card and what driver?
[01:40] <brainsik> yoshig3: are you sure you are using the right video driver?
[01:40] <yoshig3> EVERYONE: Yes I'm using the right nVidia driver
[01:40] <yoshig3> Arwen: GeForce4 MX 4000
[01:40] <yoshig3> PCI
[01:41] <Arwen> yoshig3, glxinfo | grep direct
[01:41] <Arwen> yoshig3, some older NVidia's require legacy support
[01:41] <yoshig3> on some webpage it said it wasn't legacy, but lemme check
[01:41] <kitche> yoshig3: that card doesn't need legacy drivers sicne geforce 2 isn't even legacy yet
[01:42] <yoshig3> Arwen: Says yes direct rendering
[01:42] <Arwen> yoshig3, glxgears -printfps - tell me how many?
[01:42] <AngryElf> is thereis there a command that does the equivolent of crtl+alt+backspace?
[01:43] <ThePub> what's the dpkg command to tell me what package owns a file?
[01:43] <cmt^^> Arwen - noone here seems to be able to help, so what am I supposed to do?
[01:43] <Arwen> AngryElf, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart

[01:43] <LjL> ThePub: or use apt-file if you don't have that package installed
[01:43] <Arwen> cmt^^, try the forum.... the guys here aren't actually that uber
[01:43] <whyameye> brainsik: yes sorry. Silly question and thanks for the responses though.
[01:43] <Arwen> yoshig3, ok, performance is normal.... are you using xgl/beryl/compiz?
[01:43] <ThePub> LjL: thanks
[01:44] <brainsik> ThePub: dpkg -S file
[01:44] <yoshig3> Arwen: No, fresh install
[01:44] <brainsik> ooops, slow on the uptake here :-)
[01:44] <Arwen> yoshig3, how slow is it? absurdly or kinda/
[01:44] <yoshig3> Arwen: I feel like I'm running windows XP with no graphics card, that's how slow.
[01:45] <xzela> bummer
[01:45] <robdeman> so I have installed vnc4server
[01:45] <yoshig3> Arwen: It shouldn't be drawing slowly anyway, I have a 2.4Ghz
[01:45] <robdeman> is there any control panel where I can see what services are running, disable them etc?
[01:45] <Arwen> yoshig3, hrmm........ glxinfo | grep vendor - and CPU isn't relevant to graphics

[01:46] <lubix> i am back

[01:47] <Arwen> yoshig3, your problem is outside my ability to solve, sorry :-(
[01:47] <yoshig3> Arwen: damn
[01:47] <Arwen> and I have to leave now, so sorry... I'm sure if you wait someone will help you
[01:47] <yoshig3> Arwen: It's just windows drawing slow, that's it
[01:48] <yuv656> is there a better way to see my memory usage on the command line than the 'free' shell command, it's giving incorrect values?
[01:48] <batman> hey will someone help me? 1st day ever using linux
[01:48] <xzela> yoshig3: I have seen that in a normal install of ubuntu, i think that just might be how it is
[01:48] <Music_Shuffle> batman, with?
[01:48] <yoshig3> xzela: really?
[01:48] <Music_Shuffle> xzela, what what is?
[01:48] <yoshig3> xzela: that sucks...
[01:48] <kerwonz> wher can i download the kernel for packages for 2.6.18
[01:48] <batman> well i download an mpg file
[01:48] <batman> and i cant play it
[01:48] <brainsik> yuv656: why do you think they are incorrect?
[01:48] <yoshig3> xzela: as long as I have system performance though
[01:48] <yoshig3> batman: get VLC
[01:48] <xzela> yoshig3: though after i installed beryl it seemed to draw the windows much faster
[01:48] <yuv656> brainsik: because my system monitor is reporting a third of what free is reporting
[01:48] <yoshig3> batman: go to add/remove programs
[01:49] <yoshig3> so xgl and beryl?
[01:49] <Music_Shuffle> Or mplayer.
[01:49] <yoshig3> xzela: will you message me please?
[01:49] <drkm> am i looking in the wrong place, or in 'Computer' is there a place I look to find out my HD used space and total space?
[01:49] <batman> yup
[01:49] <MrKeuner> hi, I am using syndaemon to disable the touchpad on my laptop when a key on keyboard is pressed to prevent small accidents while typing. It is pretty a good utility, however when I need to use alt key for example together with touchpad it causes problems. is there a way to take some keys out of syndaemon's domain?
[01:49] <batman> then
[01:49] <brainsik> yuv656: well, there are different ways of claiming "free" memory. free gives you a few different interpretrations.
[01:49] <yoshig3> music_shuffle I can't get rythmbox to play anything, it's pretty useless and won't let me uninstall
[01:50] <flodine> anyone know why firefox wont refresh on a sports page update?
[01:50] <schisms> xmms
[01:50] <schisms> ?
[01:50] <batman> go at add/remove programs and then what?
[01:50] <schisms> Try xmms music player.
[01:50] <yuv656> brainsik: can i get the value that system monitor displays on the command line?
[01:50] <schisms> I think you have to uninstall it from synaptic.
[01:50] <batman> n then what?
[01:50] <kitche> yuv656: you will always get incorrect values since free estimates the free ram
[01:50] <Jaak> where do i find the apps that autostart on startup (apache mysql) how do i disable them?
[01:50] <ubun> if rthymbox isnt playin anything it's because you havent installed the codecs and libs you need
[01:50] <yoshig3> xzela: will you message me please? I tried messaging you....I want your help
[01:51] <xzela> yoshig3: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/XGL
[01:51] <chris__> yuv656: cat /proc/meminfo
[01:51] <brainsik> yuv656: can you paste your free output? (don't do it here, use something like http://pastebin.ca/)
[01:51] <Music_Shuffle> Jaak, under Gnome?
[01:51] <schisms> ubun's right.
[01:51] <yoshig3> batman: add/remove programs then go to sound, then VLC
[01:51] <xzela> yoshig3: I'm not sure if i can walk you through an install of beryl
[01:51] <yoshig3> batman: it's the best I could find so far
[01:51] <yoshig3> xzela: really? Crap
[01:51] <yuv656> chris_: thanks
[01:51] <schisms> I could.
[01:51] <robdeman> so folks, port 5900 is always open b/c of Ubuntu's 'remote desktop' stuff which is actually VNC?
[01:51] <schisms> PM me if it's acceptable.
[01:51] <yuv656> brainsik: i'll quickly try chris_'s suggestion first
[01:51] <yoshig3> xzela: I want the help XD lol I couldn't figure it out the first time
[01:51] <batman> i dont see VLC under sound
[01:51] <robdeman> this is indepent from the vnc4server I want to install?
[01:51] <xzela> yoshig3: The link i sent helped me install it
[01:51] <schisms> I can help you install beryl.
[01:52] <yoshig3> should I install beryl or Xgl?
[01:52] <yuv656> batman: use the synaptic package manger
[01:52] <brainsik> yuv656: free parses /proc/meminfo
[01:52] <schisms> Beryl.
[01:52] <n8k99> batman vlc should be under multimedia
[01:52] <Jaak> Music_Shuffle, yes?
[01:52] <schisms> It's easier on the system.
[01:52] <kitche> yoshig3: well considering beryla nd XGL are two different things
[01:52] <fatalcure> robdeman: yes, if you have enabled it via Sys -> Prefs -> Remote Desktop
[01:52] <kitche> yoshig3: I would say install both
[01:52] <schisms> Beryl runs a lot smoother.
[01:52] <sethk> robdeman, if you run vnc, then vnc is running.
[01:52] <Music_Shuffle> Jaak, System -> Preferences -> Session -> Startup Programs tab and edit there.
[01:52] <yoshig3> kitche: why both?
[01:52] <schisms> You should try out both.
[01:52] <dv_> yoshig3, do you have a nvidia card?
[01:53] <yoshig3> dv_: yes
[01:53] <kitche> yoshig3: XGL is a server beryl is a window manager two different things
[01:53] <dv_> then forget XGL
[01:53] <fatalcure> robdeman: yes, vnc4server won't run on any ports until you tell it to
[01:53] <dv_> use the new drivers
[01:53] <kerwonz> somebody can help me where  can i download the linux image 2.6.18?
[01:53] <kitche> !nvidia9|yoshig3
[01:53] <ubotu> yoshig3: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[01:53] <chris__> yuv656: have you also tried the 'top' command?
[01:53] <fatalcure> !info linux-generic feisty
[01:53] <ubotu> linux-generic: Complete Generic Linux kernel. In component restricted, is optional. Version 2.6.17.10 (edgy), package size 23 kB, installed size 52 kB
[01:53] <sethk> kerwonz, I've only seen source for 2.6.18; I don't think there is an ubuntu package for it yet.
[01:54] <fatalcure> pfft
[01:54] <yuv656> chris_: i'm parsing the output of a pipe, so i don't think a command like top that changes dynamically would work?
[01:54] <tonyyarusso> fatalcure: The bot doesn't know devel versions (they move way to fast to keep track of anyway)
[01:54] <toastytaco> Is there another pinter manager for ubuntu??????] 
[01:54] <tonyyarusso> fatalcure: packages.ubuntu.com still works
[01:54] <yoshig3> kitche: I already have drivers, I'm not that dumb lol. BUT, which should I install? XGL or BERYL? And, should I install both?!
[01:54] <sethk> toastytaco, another than what?  there are at least three that I know of
[01:54] <fatalcure> tonyyarusso: k, vmt
[01:54] <dv_> yoshig3,  essentially, beryl is a window/compositing manager that renders the windows using opengl. it needs ext_texture_from_pixmap (an opengl extension) for this. xgl provides it, aiglx provides it. but nvidia provides it out-of-the-box, so no need for xgl or aiglx.
[01:54] <schisms> Beryl.
[01:54] <batman> i cant find VLC under add/remove programs or synpatic
[01:54] <kitche> yoshig3: well with the drivers that come with edgy you need XGL
[01:54] <schisms> Aiglx is already installed.
[01:54] <tonyyarusso> !universe | batman
[01:54] <ubotu> batman: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[01:54] <yoshig3> dv_: so I just need beryl?
[01:54] <schisms> Yeah.
[01:54] <dv_> yep
[01:55] <schisms> Need help installing it?
[01:55] <dv_> if you have the newest nvidia drivers (the 9629 ones or newer)
[01:55] <schisms> I've done it like 10 times.
[01:55] <yoshig3> dv_: but what if I have the supported drivers installed?
[01:55] <Psykovsky> is there any Shell coder that could help me with simple shell script issue?
[01:55] <yoshig3> dv_: I dont' have the beta's
[01:55] <toastytaco> I am tring to configure my dell 3100cn other than to print to A4 paper and the settings in the manager does not seem to work.
[01:55] <dv_> yoshig3, they arent beta
[01:55] <dv_> 9631 are stable
[01:55] <dv_> 9742 are beta
[01:55] <kerwonz> sethk: damnn it :/ i have a problem with alsa and the kernel 2.6.18 only fix it... well i need to make it manually ? :/
[01:55] <yoshig3> dv_: how do I check my version?
[01:55] <drkm> how do I change the default program some file extensions use?
[01:55] <sethk> kerwonz, yes, but that's not difficult to do
[01:55] <Panagant> ;o;
[01:55] <brainsik> Psykovsky: what's the prob?
[01:56] <Panagant> oo
[01:56] <dv_> yoshig3, basically the ubuntu ones are still 8xxx
[01:56] <tom_kelleher> could somebody please help me fix my sources list
[01:56] <yoshig3> dv_: but how do I check my verison?
[01:56] <dv_> so you need to install them manually
[01:56] <dv_> yoshig3, how did you install them before?
[01:56] <fatalcure> !defaultapp | drkm
[01:56] <ubotu> drkm: To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties -> Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror -> Settings -> Configure and then hit "File Associations"
[01:57] <yoshig3> dv_: don't remember, I think from terminal
[01:57] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: put it on a pastebin
[01:57] <dv_> ..
[01:57] <dv_> using synaptic?
[01:57] <dv_> or apt-get?
[01:57] <Panagant> lol
[01:57] <yoshig3> dv_: there's no way to check my version?
[01:57] <drkm> fatalcure: what is Nautilus?
[01:57] <yoshig3> dv_: using apt-get I think
[01:57] <dv_> then they are 8xxx ones
[01:57] <Music_Shuffle> !nautilus
[01:57] <ubotu> nautilus: file manager and graphical shell for GNOME. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 586 kB, installed size 1424 kB
[01:57] <dv_> search in the forums for installation guides,
[01:57] <fatalcure> drkm: the Gnome file manager (what is run when you select things from the Places menu)
[01:57] <dv_> they cover uninstalling the old ones
[01:58] <Panagant> cho
[01:58] <yoshig3> dv_: I don't think I wanna use the guides, they always mess me up
[01:58] <dv_> (please, could anyone add the newest nvidia drivers to the repository?)
[01:58] <Psykovsky> brainsik, private chat...
[01:58] <dv_> yoshig3, there is no other way.
[01:58] <drkm> fatalcure: thanks
[01:58] <yoshig3> dv_: will you just tell me how to find my version?
[01:58] <fatalcure> drkm: yw :)
[01:58] <kerwonz> sethk: but where can i see what drivers i need too?
[01:58] <dv_> oh, well, you can wait for the newest drivers to be added to the repository.
[01:58] <fatalcure> !nvidiabeta
[01:58] <ubotu> For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[01:58] <dv_> yoshig3, it doesnt matter, they are definitely 8xxx ones
[01:58] <sethk> kerwonz, you can use your current configuration
[01:58] <robdeman> and how do I terminate a shell?
[01:58] <xzela> yoshig3: version for what?
[01:58] <brainsik> Psykovsky: are you not seeing my messages to you?
[01:59] <yoshig3> dv_: Do you not konw how to find your version?
[01:59] <kerwonz> sethk: how?
[01:59] <sethk> kerwonz, change only what needs to be changed (if anything)
[01:59] <dv_> there is no sure way to do that
[01:59] <fatalcure> robdeman: <CTRL>D
[01:59] <Psykovsky> brainsik seems that I dont...
[01:59] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  http://pastebin.ca/276101
[01:59] <yoshig3> xzela: my nvidia driver versions
[01:59] <sethk> kerwonz, in /boot. there is a file configXXXXXXXXX, where the XXXXXXXXXXX is the kernel version
[01:59] <brainsik> weird
[01:59] <robdeman> fatalcure: Can I terminate another shell?
[01:59] <kerwonz> sethk: i dont need change anything, so is only a path applied in the new alsa.
[01:59] <dv_> oh, try sudo apt-cache show nvidia-glx
[01:59] <Music_Shuffle> robdeman, exit works too. ;P
[01:59] <sethk> kerwonz, you copy that file into the kernel source root directory with the name .config
[01:59] <robdeman> fatalcure: like from another user?
[01:59] <sethk> kerwonz, ok, then it's really simple
[01:59] <toastytaco> I have the drivers for my dell 3100cn (PPD and XML) and when I install them and set the settings to print regular US Letter it always prints A4 format...anyone can help me please..
[01:59] <dv_> there you see Installed-verson: 8xxx
[01:59] <kerwonz> sethk: thanks
[01:59] <sethk> kerwonz, copy in that file, named to .config.   then do    make oldconfig
[01:59] <xzela> yoshig3: hmm, not sure, don't use nVidia
[01:59] <dv_> just as I said over and over
[01:59] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  that's my source list if you could please help
[01:59] <flodine> does anyone know why firefox wont refresh a page?
[02:00] <sethk> kerwonz, then make, then as root make install
[02:00] <fatalcure> robdeman: you can kill it if you know the process number the command 'ps aux' helps with that
[02:00] <schisms> Try epiphany, flodine.
[02:00] <drkm> fatalcure: I just did what it suggested for Nautilus but when I reopen the video, it opens in the old default player.. ?
[02:00] <cmt^^> anyone with an ati-card here who has managed to get tv-out working properly?
[02:00] <yuv656> brainsik: i've checked, i see /proc/meminfo is the same as free. so how do i get the user memory shown in the system monitor?
[02:00] <sethk> kerwonz, you'll get a few questions about a handful of new configuration options, just hit enter to take the defaults
[02:00] <yoshig3> dv_: "1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1"
[02:00] <wasp_ems> anyone know what trailing backslash is?
[02:00] <dv_> 8xxx, as I said.
=== Limulf is now known as Turgon
[02:00] <yoshig3> dv_: so these are old, so how do I install the new ones?
[02:00] <brainsik> yuv656: one sec, i'm helping Psykovsky
[02:00] <dv_> -> search a guide.
=== Turgon is now known as Limulf
[02:01] <yuv656> ok
[02:01] <sethk> wasp_ems, a backslash at the end of a string
[02:01] <dv_> I do not remember the exact steps
[02:01] <dv_> but I got them from a guide
[02:01] <dv_> note, you HAVE to uninstall the current ones
[02:01] <wasp_ems> sethk, i get it when i press tab to continue a path..why does it come up?
[02:01] <Psykovsky> brainsik you can see what I wrote in private chat?
[02:01] <dv_> the problem is that this removes the restricted_modules package, which includes stuff for wifi drivers etc. as well
=== Limulf is now known as Turgon
[02:01] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: wow, that is some sources.list file.  What problem are you experiencing?
[02:01] <brainsik> Psykovsky: yeah i saw it.. that script is working fine for me
[02:01] <robdeman> ok kool
[02:02] <sethk> wasp_ems, probably because there is a space at the end of the file name, and you are really seeing  backslash space
[02:02] <brainsik> Psykovsky: how are you running it?
[02:02] <fatalcure> drkm: where are you opening the video from?
[02:02] <robdeman> I installed vnc over ssh (followed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH) and now I am getting a greyish desktop with nothing on it?
[02:02] <dv_> yoshig3, this is why I recommend to look for a guide
[02:02] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  every time I refresh my sources, or try to update, or install a new app I get a ton of errors
[02:02] <dv_> in the forums
[02:02] <drkm> fatalcure: double clicking the video on my desktop
[02:02] <Psykovsky> brainsik: it's a big script emulating telnet server, running it via netcat
[02:02] <sethk> robdeman, vnc performance is so bad that it tries to eliminate as much from the display as possible
[02:02] <dv_> btw. which nvidia card do you have?
[02:02] <sethk> robdeman, vnc is rarely the best way to do something
[02:02] <brainsik> Psykovsky: what shell is parsing it?
[02:03] <robdeman> sethk: it looks more like there is no desktop or something?
[02:03] <robdeman> should I go for xmdcp?
[02:03] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  not to mention when I try to use apps like easy Ubuntu I have errors when trying to install the DVD stuff
[02:03] <brk3> could anyone tell me how to not make the screen lock when i close the lid of my laptop?
[02:03] <yuv656> robdeman: you can do practically anything using shell commands over ssh?
[02:03] <yoshig3> dv_: "http://albertomilone.com/latest_nvidia_udsf_edgy.html" will this work?
[02:03] <sethk> robdeman, I would go for xdmcp, if that's an option, definitely.  the performance is excellent, just as if you are on the machine locally
[02:03] <Psykovsky> brainsik: sh 3.1
[02:03] <MistaED> hey all, would anyone know if grub could boot a root filesystem from an image file? like have an ext3 partition contain an image formatted in ext3 with the filesystem inside, like an image from vmware/qemu?
[02:03] <Kazero> So I want to put ubuntu on my hard drive, but I have too much stuff so I cant format, and the partition manager says "unable to resize/delete partition". What do I do?
[02:03] <ryanakca> my apt keeps sigsev'ing... I filed a bug report about it with the bug number of 75273... how can I fix it?
[02:03] <robdeman> yuv656: Im really trying to get a remote desktop :)
[02:03] <schisms> Kazero
[02:03] <schisms> How much space do you have?
[02:04] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: i'm not suprised.  You should really only keep Ubuntu repos enabled for (dist-)upgrades and only enable others when you want to install something in particular from them.  Having so many repos enabled means that clashes between them are almost inevitable.
[02:04] <MistaED> like could i do "root=UUID=hexnumber/rootimagefile ?
[02:04] <yuv656> ok then
[02:04] <sethk> MistaED, if the image is formatted in a way that grub understands, which means as an initramfs (or the older initrd)
[02:04] <Kazero> schisms: Its a 250gb HD with 113gb free
[02:04] <fatalcure> drkm: hm, that should work :/
[02:04] <schisms> Wow
[02:04] <brainsik> yuv656: i'm not sure what you mean by "user memory" -- you want a sum of all the memory used by a specific user?
[02:04] <schisms> I have no clue.
[02:04] <kerwonz> sethk: thanks ;))
[02:04] <dv_> hmm
[02:04] <schisms> Did you try shrinking it?
[02:04] <dv_> this should do
[02:04] <brk3> anyone know how to just make ubuntu do nothing when i close the lid of my laptop..?
[02:04] <toastytaco> SO No one can help me then????
=== Turgon is now known as turgon
[02:04] <dv_> I followed a different guide though
[02:04] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  yea, that makes sense. The list is like that because I had some help installing Nvidia drivers and Beryl last night
=== turgon is now known as Turgon
[02:04] <schisms> There's probably a way to disable standby.
[02:04] <brainsik> Psykovsky: do you mean bash?
[02:05] <dv_> amaranth's, but his mirror is down, so its useless now
[02:05] <brk3> at the moment its locking the screen so i have to put in my password to unlock
[02:05] <brainsik> Psykovsky: invoked as /bin/sh ??
[02:05] <drkm> fatalcure: if i right click it says 'Play in Movie Player' and under that it says 'Open With VLC'... I want VLC open it lol
[02:05] <yuv656> brainsik: my system monitor displays "User Memory" of 500MB but free says 1.4GB is "used" and about 100MB free..
[02:05] <Psykovsky> yes
[02:05] <yuv656> 500MB in use that is
[02:05] <MistaED> sethk: ok does initramfs boot the fileystem via the fstab? if that's the case then i guess it would work then, i want to store the /boot directly on the drive
[02:05] <Psykovsky> brainsik:  #!/bin/sh
[02:06] <sethk> MistaED, you can do that, but in two stages.  use an initramfs file system to get enough of a system up and running to mount the real file system; I guess you mean you want to do a loopback mount
[02:06] <brainsik> yuv656: paste the output of free to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, the second line may be what you are looking for
[02:06] <robdeman> how do I start/stop a service?

[02:06] <robdeman> (sorry 4 asking so much, but you are a great help all)
[02:06] <brainsik> Psykovsky: what does 'ls -l /bin/sh' say?
[02:06] <robdeman> high learning curve here :)
[02:07] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: i'd suggest commenting out everything from Seveas' packages (line 51) down
[02:07] <Psykovsky> bash
[02:07] <Psykovsky> brainsik: bash
[02:07] <robdeman> there is no 'service' command
[02:07] <POCHTA> help me please Z173021656767 web mony 0.3$
[02:07] <sethk> MistaED, after you get the real root file system mounted you use either pivot_root or chroot to make it the current root file system
[02:07] <MistaED> sethk: indeed, i wanted to do the ubuntu boot from usb disk but have a 10gb image of ubuntu's root filesystem stored on the drive instead of the actual partition being the filesystem, and just have /boot open
[02:07] <robdeman> fedore used 'service httpd stop' etc

=== Turgon is now known as Limulf
[02:08] <yuv656> brainsik: that seems like the correct value on the second line, yes :)
[02:08] <brainsik> Psykovsky: does that code snippet you pasted to me work for you? by itself?
[02:08] <fatalcure> robdeman: 'sudo invoke-rc.d <service> stop'
[02:08] <MistaED> sethk: cool, sounds like something fun to do today :)
[02:08] <brainsik> yuv656: that's the number you really care about

[02:09] <sholden> is there a new PLF repo for codecs?  The one I have listed is giving me 404
[02:09] <peacekpr> Does anyone here have any experience getting the printing system to work in Edgy (AMD64) ?
[02:10] <Kazero> how do you use the terminal command killall when a program freezes?
[02:10] <peacekpr> I am dumbfounded at this point as to why I cannot print
[02:10] <mnoir> Kazero: you start with > man killall
[02:10] <zero-1> does anyone know a free PHP IDE ?
[02:10] <Kazero> > man killall?
[02:10] <mnoir> and you understand what it can do
[02:10] <robdeman> zero-1: Eclipse-PHP
[02:10] <zero-1> Eclipse keeps crushing and wont let me work
[02:10] <ibb> bluefish, php ide
[02:10] <zero-1> yea I have it
[02:11] <zero-1> but it keeps closing it self
[02:11] <yoshig3> dv_: how do I uninstall my drivers?
[02:11] <robdeman> the vnc works but my desktop shows only a terminal window?
[02:11] <fatalcure> Kazero: you need to determine the executable that is running.  For example 'killall firefox-bin' (for firefox)
[02:11] <robdeman> should I 'bind' tighvncserver to X11 desktop or something like that
[02:11] <zero-1> bluefish supports php ???
[02:11] <dv_> yoshig3, look in the guide you found
[02:11] <MSTK> hey all
[02:11] <drkm> is it safe to remove totem even though it says it will remove 'ubuntu-desktop' ?
[02:11] <tonyyarusso> drkm: Yes.
[02:11] <tonyyarusso> !ubuntu-desktop
[02:11] <ubotu> k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[02:12] <drkm> ok thanks
[02:12] <fatalcure> robdeman: that howto on the forums did look very good: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=122402&highlight=vnc+xdmcp
[02:12] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  wow, I started commenting those lines out, but I just realized how many there is...
[02:12] <mnoir> in other words, it is a bad idea to remove it since you will never remember to put it back
[02:12] <robdeman> fatalcure: yes did not try it, I tried that VNCoverSSH tutorual
[02:12] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: perhaps take a copy and just delete the lines :)  I have never seen a sources.list like that before :)
[02:12] <robdeman> ok I iwll try this one
[02:13] <MSTK> I'm a new convert from windows.  can anyone recommend me a good media player/organizer similar to WinAmp/iTunes that plays videos and has iPod support?
[02:13] <MSTK> I've been using rhythmbox, but it doesn't play videos =/
[02:13] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  lol there wouldn't happen to be a good list I could copy on line or something?
[02:13] <jwhitlark> anyone know a workaround for the 2GB file size limit in apache2?  Or the best way to compile 2.2 on dapper?
[02:13] <Music_Shuffle> MSTK, amarok, but no vids.
[02:13] <MSTK> yeah, that's the main problem I've been stumbling into
[02:13] <kitche> MSTK: amarok(kde) or banshee(Gnome)
[02:13] <fatalcure> robdeman: ah, kk.  If security is an issue then VNCoverSSH would be better.
[02:13] <tonyyarusso> mnoir: Something like that ;)  I usually do clean installs rather than upgrades anyway, so it matters less, but having the disk space I usually don't remove things.
[02:14] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: lines 1 to 49 of yours :)
[02:14] <MistaED> MSTK: can't just use totem for video, separate from the music player?
[02:14] <robdeman> fatalcure: yes.. I tried it but it looks like it has some empty desktop not the Ubuntu one
[02:14] <yoshig3> dv_: it doesn't say how to uninstall my drivers in the guide
[02:14] <yoshig3> dv_: any ideas?
[02:14] <mnoir> tonyyarusso: yeah - me too - though I seem to be one of the few who got a clean system upgrading 6.06 to 6.10
[02:14] <MistaED> i think maybe the democracy player can do it all, but i've never used that
[02:14] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  lol okay I'm just deleting those lines then
[02:14] <MSTK> Mistaed: excuse me for being ignorant, but, "Totem"?
[02:15] <dv_> oh
[02:15] <dv_> well it does
[02:15] <MistaED> MSTK: sorry, "the movie player" is really called totem player ;)
[02:15] <MSTK> ah
[02:15] <MSTK> heh
[02:15] <drkm> when using apt-get.. how do i get it to reinstall what i select?
[02:15] <dv_> look for the line with apt-ger --purge remove
[02:15] <MSTK> well, movie player doesn't update to the iPod =/
[02:15] <Music_Shuffle> MSTK, amarok does.
[02:15] <MSTK> but it doesn't support videos
[02:15] <fatalcure> robdeman: yes, that's an issue with what is started when the X session starts.  Unfortunately I don't have much expertise with that.
[02:15] <kitche> MSTK: to use ipod video on linux it will be hard due to the DRM
[02:16] <MistaED> MSTK: like put videos onto the ipod? i'd like a solution like that
[02:16] <robdeman> agg ok
[02:16] <yoshig3> dv_: I lied
[02:16] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  my source list now looks like this : http://pastebin.ca/276115
[02:16] <yoshig3> dv_: my fault
[02:16] <MSTK> my videos don't have DRM
[02:16] <Music_Shuffle> lol
[02:16] <MSTK> yeah, using an iPod video on Linux.  I guess that's my main problem
[02:16] <MSTK> I can always use the manual loaders
[02:16] <MSTK> but I was hoping for something that also works as a media player too
[02:16] <MistaED> MSTK: i have an ipod video which has never played a video, haha
[02:17] <MistaED> which kinda sucks, i'd like to from linux
[02:17] <MSTK> you can, I think
[02:17] <MSTK> with this one stand-alone program
[02:17] <Psykovsky> brainsik: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36521/
[02:17] <MSTK> but it's for loading and unloading only
[02:17] <brainsik> Psykovsky: ok
=== Jordan_U_ is now known as Jordan_U
[02:18] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: trim, taught and teriffic! :)  One thing I've just realised, having edgy-proposed enabled means that you will be getting beta versions of updated to Edgy (ie. helping the devs make sure that a proposed update isn't going to cause havok).  Might be worth commenting out those 2 lines if stability is highly important to you.
[02:18] <fatalcure> *updates
[02:19] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: sorry, 4 lines
[02:19] <funkyHat> I'm trying to sign a file with my PGP key, so I right click on the file and click sign, I get a dialog that says 'Couldn't load keys' 'End of file'
[02:19] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  oh, yea, I think I'll keep the stable stuff. thanks lol.
[02:19] <MSTK> so noone has any ideas for a linux winamp/itunes like media player that syncs video? (to an iPod)
[02:19] <peacekpr> Has anyone had serious issues with the print server in Edgy?  I get "unable to connect to server" when I execute the command "lpq"
[02:19] <funkyHat> Is this a known bug?
[02:20] <dope> if i reinstall xp will it mess up the bootloader and i'll lose ubuntu?
[02:20] <funkyHat> MSTK, I believe amaroK and gtkPod both do that...
[02:20] <kitche> dope: you would have to reinstall grub
[02:20] <dope> just grub?
[02:20] <dang`r`us> hello there. I'm running edgy eft with the ati binary drivers, and the last system update (which contained an update for xorg) killed 3d acceleartion for me: (EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable
[02:20] <Psykovsky> brainsik: at the end I wrote how does it start via netcat, it binds to 224 port, and listens like a simple telnet server...
[02:20] <kitche> dope: yes if you don't delete the ubuntu partition
[02:20] <MSTK> funkyhat: Amarok doesn't play Video, if I recall correctly
[02:21] <funkyHat> dope, it will mess up the bootloader, but that's relatively simple to fix, you won't loose ubuntu unless XP takes it upon itself to overwrite your ubuntu partitions
[02:21] <brainsik> Psykovsky: does the script run fine from the command line or is broken there to?
[02:21] <carzzz215> does anyone know why I get "configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables" when I try to compile my alsa sound driver?
[02:21] <moshe> hello
[02:21] <funkyHat> MSTK, I know, but iirc it will still sync it to an iPod... might be wrong though, I don't own an iPod or use amaroK personally ;)
[02:21] <Psykovsky> brainsik: what do you mean?
[02:21] <kitche> dang`r`us: well considering that ATI binary drives never worked with AIGLX I see that as not a problem
[02:21] <dope> ok cool.  the install disc installed grub the first time.  is grub relatively easy to reinstall?
[02:21] <fatalcure> carzzz215: install build-essential
[02:21] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  this better? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36522/
[02:21] <brainsik> Psykovsky: what happens you just run ./servas.sh
[02:21] <MSTK> yeah, Amark has fine iPod syncing
[02:21] <kitche> !grub|dope
[02:21] <ubotu> dope: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:21] <MSTK> but it won't do videos, I think

[02:21] <carzzz215> fatalcure, from synaptic?
[02:22] <dang`r`us> kitche, well, I'm not really using aiglx, but it's the only (EE) line from Xorg.log
[02:22] <fatalcure> carzzz215: yep
[02:22] <dang`r`us> and until the update 3d acceleration worked ...
[02:22] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: looks good
[02:22] <brainsik> Psykovsky: interesting .. it works fine for me from the command line but not in netcat... okay.
[02:23] <funkyHat> dope, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[02:23] <kitche> dang`r`us: yeah it's an error but ATI binary never used aiglx it's enabled by default in edgy, but do glxinfo|grep rendering and see what it says
=== finarfin is now known as dj_baggio
[02:23] <Psykovsky> brainsik: it reacts to "exit" OK, but I need it to react when it's working from netcat
[02:23] <dope> ok awesome, thx a ton
[02:23] <brainsik> Psykovsky: okay, i'm looking into ti
[02:23] <drkm> I've just installed VLC to stream my movies on sites and described on ubuntuguide but when I go to a site with a video it just says 'No Video'.. does anyone know how to have it select VLC to play it?
[02:23] <dang`r`us> kitche, mesa
[02:24] <kitche> dang`r`us: glxinfo|grep vendor see if it's still using the ATI binary drivers
[02:24] <lambo4jos> i am trying to checkout a subversion project onto my windows laptop; a project that exists on an ubuntu remote desktop.  the two computers are connected through a netgear router and cable internet.  can anyone help?
[02:24] <dang`r`us> kitche, server vendor: SGI, client vendor: ATI, opengl vendor: mesa project
[02:25] <kitche> lambo4jos: that's doesn't really explain what error you are getting
[02:25] <kitche> dang`r`us: ok it seems like you have to enable direct rendering
[02:25] <Kazer0> Does anyone know of how I can get my ubuntu live CD to read and write on my NTFS partitions? It wont let me resize, and I want to use Ubuntu for downloading
[02:25] <kitche> dang`r`us: see what driver your xorg.conf is using by looking at /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:26] <dang`r`us> kitche, fglrx
[02:26] <tim167> what's good video editing program? (for importing from mini-dv camera and basic editing) thanks!
=== joepits is now known as Joeshmo
[02:26] <dang`r`us> kitche, just a second, I'm beginning to suspect that the upgrade has changed my xorg.conf, I'll just copy an old one over there
[02:26] <zac1> How do you mount an Mp3 player?
[02:26] <neruatix> tim167: kino
[02:26] <dang`r`us> zac1, usually just plug it in
[02:26] <Joeshmo> so i have nvidia-glx-legacy installed and working but winecfg says it cant find glx
[02:26] <Joeshmo> anyone know what is wrong?
[02:26] <keeganX> Why can't I install the totem-xine-firefox-plugin on Edgy?  When I try to install it, it says totem-mozilla is already installed.
[02:26] <zac1> that dosn't work
[02:27] <tim167> neruatix: thanks
[02:27] <kitche> zac1: what kind of mp3 player is it just a usb type or a hard drive?
[02:27] <neruatix> tim167: there is a better program, but i can't remember the name, perhaps a search thorugh synaptics will help :)
[02:27] <zac1> usb
[02:27] <brainsik> Psykovsky: this is very weird
[02:28] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  great, I don't think I have any errors with my sources now. Except easyUbuntu still won't download the DVD stuff, says there is a 404 with the source. Is that because I don't have the source in my list, or because they are down.
[02:28] <Psykovsky> brainsik: I need to do a log server for my companies phone calls statistics, it has a hardware router who connects to telnet server and sends calling info line by line...
[02:28] <neruatix> tim167: but i guess kino works for basic editing, even though i've never used it really :P
[02:28] <kitche> zac1: well that didn't really anwser my question, sicne my ipod is usb but it's hard drive one but it should be automounted if it's just a flash one
[02:28] <Psykovsky> brainsik: if you know any easyer way to do it, you could share :)

[02:28] <zac1> flash
[02:29] <Joeshmo> anyone know why winecfg would report no glx
[02:29] <brainsik> Psykovsky: yeah, the weird thing is this works from the command line, but not when execute by netcat .. i'm still debugging it, i'm not stumped yet.
[02:29] <kitche> zac1: check dmesg to see if anything is in there about your mp3 player
[02:29] <Joeshmo> can anyone here me
[02:29] <zac1> !mp3 player
[02:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mp3 player - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:30] <kitche> Joeshmo: you might not have glx module enabled
[02:30] <Softly> hi
[02:30] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: sorry, i don't know how easyubuntu works.  It does have its own channel.  What "DVD stuff" are you looking for?
[02:30] <tim167> neruatix: the problem with synaptic is I cant search for description, only by name and the term 'video' doesnt show 'Kino' obviously
[02:30] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  libdvdcss2
[02:31] <kitche> keeganX: you need to remove xine-mozilla since totem-xine-firefox-plugin conflict with each other
[02:31] <neruatix> hmm, you can search for description?
[02:31] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: ah, sec...
[02:31] <tim167> neruatix: if I search by description synaptic takes an infinitely long time to search
[02:31] <jpopesku> could someone direct me to a good mp3 (mainly ID3 tags) channel/server...?
[02:31] <neruatix> oh, just wait :)
[02:31] <keeganX> Alrighty thanks
[02:31] <zac1> kitche: Yes there is!
[02:31] <brainsik> Psykovsky: oooh, i have a theory about this! a few more tests.
[02:31] <keeganX> kitche: there is no xine-mozilla package I have installed
[02:32] <Psykovsky> brainsik: but they won't solve my problems, will they?
[02:32] <brainsik> Psykovsky: yes, they will :-)
[02:32] <kitche> keeganX: hmm odd since it says that it is ?
[02:32] <dang`r`us> kitche, old config solved my problem, thanks for offering help though
[02:32] <Psykovsky> brainsik: would be great :)
[02:32] <kitche> zac1: then it's most likely mounted already check /media
[02:33] <kitche> zac1: or type mount and see what's mounted
[02:33] <keeganX> I did sudo aptitude search xine and that package never showed up
[02:33] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: It's available in Seveas' repository, but you can get it directly from (for example) here: http://mirror2.ubuntulinux.nl/pool/edgy-seveas/extras/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-0.0ubuntu4_i386.deb
[02:33] <zac1> kitche: not there!
[02:33] <tim167> anyone have this problem with synaptic on ubuntu edgy ? "search by name or description" takes forever...can only do search by name effectively
[02:34] <brainsik> Psykovsky: got it
[02:34] <Kazer0> Can anyone tell me how to read and write to an ntfs partition from the live cd?
[02:34] <wasp_ems> has anyone installed warcraft 3?
[02:34] <keeganX> If I can't get totem xine is there a way to make gxine embedded when I play videos instead of popping out
[02:34] <kitche> zac1: mount doesn't say something like /dev/sdX
[02:35] <brainsik> Psykovsky: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36525/
[02:35] <zac1> kitche: no
[02:35] <brainsik> Psykovsky: so, it's an encoding issue
[02:35] <tim167> Kazer0: i dont know how you do that, but someone did tell me that writing to ntfs on linux is experimental and not recommended if you dont want to risk data loss
[02:35] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure ;  thanks your a life saver

[02:36] <fatalcure> tom_kelleher: np :)
[02:36] <brainsik> Psykovsky: telnet sends \r\n but your script is looking for \n at the end of the word "exit", i can come up with a fix for this, or you can now that you know what the problem is. up to you.
[02:36] <kitche> zac1: then it seems like you need to manually mount it with sudo mount /dev/sdXc where X is a or b and c would be 1 most likely
[02:36] <Psykovsky> brainsik: thanks, I'll try to solve it...
[02:36] <peacekpr> i can't seem to be able to access the printing server in Edgy (AMD64) except through http://localhost:631
[02:37] <carzzz215> fatalcure, ok...well i got passed that error, and now i have a new one...now i have these permission denied errors and i don't know why cause i used sudo
[02:37] <brainsik> Psykovsky: did that make sense? i'd maybe use grep to test.
[02:37] <zac1> kitche:can't find sdac
[02:37] <peacekpr> lpstat, lpr, lpq are "unable to connect to server" ... i can't print from any applications
[02:37] <fatalcure> carzzz215: put them on a pastebin
[02:37] <Psykovsky> brainsik that could be because I'm testing it from windows machine...
[02:37] <brainsik> Psykovsky: and by the way, if possible, you probably shouldn't run that as root :-)
[02:37] <jpatota> whats a good software raid management utility

[02:38] <fatalcure> ?

[02:38] <peacekpr> fatalcure, yes
[02:38] <Psykovsky> brainsik plus it will run in inner network, not reachable from outside
[02:38] <kitche> zac1: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/mp3 you ight have to do mkdir /media/mp3

[02:50] <fatalcure> carzzz215: i'll take a look, no promises though :)
[02:51] <peacekpr> sethk, so it seems though there's a disconnect between cups and everything else
[02:51] <nomasteryoda> yeah! I got my system76 "Powered by Ubuntu" stickers. sweet
[02:51] <drkm> Ljl: ok.. do you know how I can move a launcher I made to 'Applications > Office' by any chance?
[02:51] <sethk> peacekpr, that doesn't make a lot of sense, since installing cups also installs the cups compatible lpq, lpr, etc.
[02:51] <peacekpr> sethk, through the HTTP interface, i've been able to get cups to recognize a network printer
[02:51] <peacekpr> sethk, didn't realize that... then this is even stranger
[02:51] <peacekpr> heh
[02:51] <sethk> peacekpr, you should be able to, yes
[02:51] <fatalcure> nomasteryoda: me too - very nice they are indeed :)
[02:51] <sethk> peacekpr, how is the network printer connected?
[02:52] <Shaba1> ubotu that page explains how to SET UP an LDAP server.
[02:52] <nomasteryoda> fatalcure, well said
[02:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about that page explains how to SET UP an LDAP server. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:52] <peacekpr> sethk, through cups... "IPP" ... the network printer is an HP connected through USB to my desktop machine
[02:52] <Shaba1> I already have that in windows2000 sever
[02:52] <carzzz215> fatalcure, ok http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36533/ it's ok if you don't get it....i really appreciate the help regardless
[02:52] <Shaba1> I need to find out how to get a linux machine to authenticate against that server.
[02:53] <sethk> peacekpr, your desktop machine is running what?  the one the printer is connected to?  linux?  windows?
[02:53] <peacekpr> the client machine is Edgy AMD64, the server is EDGY i686
[02:53] <robdeman> so my VNC shows an empty desktop with a console window.. hjow can I start a Ubunto desktop from here?
[02:53] <peacekpr> sethk, "server" meaning the computer the printer is connected to
[02:53] <sethk> peacekpr, yes, I know
[02:54] <peacekpr> and the printer works just fine on the machine it's connected to
[02:54] <sethk> peacekpr, on both machines, you need to set up the client configuration
[02:54] <yoshig3> LjL: I followed two different guides on installing the LATEST nVidia Drivers, and they are ALL telling me that the latest is 8776.
[02:54] <sethk> peacekpr, even though one is also the server.  to print, the client config needs to be set up
[02:54] <LjL> !nvidia9 | yoshig3
[02:54] <ubotu> yoshig3: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[02:54] <sethk> peacekpr, in your case, to printer locally on the machine to which the printer is connected, you have to set up both client and server
[02:54] <yoshig3> LjL: how would I install those then?
[02:54] <LjL> yoshig3: and there's another repository with 9631. but sure, the latest available *officially in Ubuntu* is 8776
[02:54] <sethk> peacekpr, the cups client config file usually is only one line, containing the ip of the server.  let me look up the exact syntax
[02:55] <webhed> !vcd
[02:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vcd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:55] <peacekpr> sethk, ServerName <ip/host>
[02:55] <LjL> yoshig3: 1) add the repository to your list 2) upgrade. you can do that in Synaptic, or from the command line
[02:55] <peacekpr> sethk, and that line is in /etc/cups/client.conf
[02:55] <yoshig3> LjL: Will these drivers allow me to use Beryl without Xgl?
[02:55] <fatalcure> carzzz215: line 113 in that paste seems to be the nub of the issue, but I'm not sure what to do.  If no-one else here knows then perhaps do some Googling on the contents of that line
[02:55] <peacekpr> i've set that up... i have also already set up the server info on the server machine
[02:55] <sethk> peacekpr, ok.  that's all you need.  I just checked my configs, which is exactly like yours'.  different printer, but I mean the printer is usb connected to a linux server, and I printer from that box as well as from other linux boxes
[02:55] <LjL> yoshig3: if you have an NVidia card, that's very likely
[02:56] <carzzz215> fatalcure, ok thanks.  I'll see what i can do
=== Doodluv is now known as Doodluv_
[02:56] <yoshig3> LjL: I do
[02:56] <sethk> peacekpr, can you successfully print the test page after you do the cups http setup?
[02:56] <ski-worklap> hmm
[02:56] <ski-worklap> ubuntu wakes from a sleep and i can't ping 127.0.0.1
[02:57] <ski-worklap> anyone ever have that problem before?

[02:57] <TheMafia> I upgraded to edgy, now I can't seem to be able to install an smp kernel?
[02:57] <ski-worklap> TheMafia, it comes with smp by default
[02:57] <peacekpr> sethk, it's trying to send the info, but i don't think the other end is wanting to pick up
[02:57] <TheMafia> it says I am running a 386 kernel?
[02:57] <yoshig3> LjL: Alright, I upgraded. What now?
[02:58] <ski-worklap> TheMafia, what do you mean by "it" ?
[02:58] <sethk> peacekpr, I mean, running a browser on the server machine, can you print the test page?  that would be a local print
[02:58] <ski-worklap> if you run uname -a you'll see it's an smp kernel compiled for 686
[02:58] <kitche> TheMafia: cat /proc/cpuifnoa dn see what it says for processors
[02:58] <sethk> peacekpr, the strategy here would be, get it working first on the server machine, then add the client.
[02:58] <LjL> yoshig3: if you did it right, now they're installed. restart X (X, not Xgl), and you should be able to run Beryl - although you might be missing window borders i guess (join #ubuntu-xgl for complete instructions on that)
[02:58] <kitche> TheMafia: /proc/cpuinfo*
[02:58] <sethk> peacekpr, which I'm sure you've already thought of, I'm just thinking out loud
[02:58] <TheMafia> cpuinfo lists only proc 0
[02:59] <ski-worklap> TheMafia, what does uname -a say
[02:59] <peacekpr> sethk, it works on the server side
[02:59] <yoshig3> LjL: But all I did was add a repository and update. How does that install drivers?
[02:59] <sethk> peacekpr, ok, good
[02:59] <kitche> TheMafia: did you reboot after you upgraded?
[02:59] <TheMafia> Linux cdavis-laptop 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Fri Oct 13 18:41:40 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux

[03:00] <James> Hello, I can't start my X, /dev/input/mice, no such device. I try to cat /dev/input/mice, no such device, i already load psmouse. why?
[03:00] <ski-worklap> TheMafia, sudo apt-get install linux-generic
[03:00] <sethk> peacekpr, I just did a trace of running lpq on my client (that is working); it uses /etc/cups/client.conf.
[03:00] <kitche> James: try cat /dev/psaux and moving the mouse to see if that's your mouse
[03:00] <James> kitche, the same result
[03:00] <LjL> yoshig3: well, then why is it strange that you would have the new drivers? you 1) added the repositories that contain a new version of some packages (the nvidia drivers) that you *already have*  2) instructed Ubuntu to upgrade anything it finds upgradable
[03:00] <LjL> at least, you should have
[03:01] <James> my mouse is ps2 kitche
[03:01] <yoshig3> LjL: it just gave me some software updates
[03:01] <LjL> yoshig3: ... like?
[03:01] <kitche> James: it should be either /dev/psaux /dev/input/mice or /dev/input/mouse[0-3] 
[03:01] <LjL> yoshig3: look, what does "apt-cache policy nvidia-glx" tell you as "candidate"?
[03:02] <peacekpr> hmmm
[03:02] <sethk> peacekpr, hmm, this is interesting, actually the client.conf file is only commented lines
[03:02] <Spaghetti_Knife> Hi, does anybody know of any IRC channels where I could get help with beginner's Java programming?
[03:02] <sethk> peacekpr, so that's not how it finds the server.
[03:02] <somerville32> Spaghetti_Knife, ##java
[03:02] <Spaghetti_Knife> somerville32 With 2 "#", and on freenode?
[03:02] <damageDOn1> Does anyone know how to get apps to launch into set workspaces on start up. I've added some apps to sessions startup programs but they all launch on workspace 1. I guess there's a command option you can add that will specify where to launch it.
[03:02] <schisms> Spaghetti_Knife
[03:02] <yoshig3> LjL: It gave me some driver updates I believe
[03:02] <schisms> Google is your friend.
[03:03] <Spaghetti_Knife> schisms Yeah?
[03:03] <schisms> There's plenty.
[03:03] <somerville32> Spaghetti_Knife, Yes.
[03:03] <LjL> yoshig3: uh... driver updates? like, the nvidia driver? :P
[03:03] <peacekpr> sethk, hmmm
[03:03] <jughead> Spaghetti_Knife, did you get your wireless figured out?
[03:03] <sethk> peacekpr, the ip actually appears (as part of the ipp url) in /etc/cups/printers.conf
[03:03] <James> kitche, :( all of them show the same result: no such device
[03:04] <sethk> peacekpr, that's the only file in /etc/cups that has the server name or ip
[03:04] <peacekpr> sethk, all lines in that file are commented out
[03:04] <sethk> peacekpr, in printers.conf?
[03:04] <peacekpr> yes

[03:04] <sethk> peacekpr, I can put mine on the paste site if you like
[03:04] <joeshmo> why isn't ubuntu using the swap file...memory is full
[03:04] <peacekpr> sethk, sure... that may be helpful
[03:04] <yoshig3> LjL: sorry for being so stupid, hard to do this with my mom screaming at me why I have her laptop =\
[03:04] <kitche> joeshmo: what does top say for your swap?
[03:04] <Spaghetti_Knife> jughead Yup.
[03:04] <rajiv_nair> joeshmo: ive been wondering thatn too
[03:04] <rajiv_nair> that*
[03:05] <joeshmo> like 2 gigs free
[03:05] <joeshmo> 0 used
[03:05] <Spaghetti_Knife> jughead I got disconnected.
[03:05] <LjL> yoshig3: 9631 perhaps?
[03:05] <joeshmo> and my mem is full
[03:05] <rajiv_nair> my mem aint full
[03:05] <joeshmo> i think its  a bug
[03:05] <lambo4jos> i am trying to connect to an svn-repo on a remote ubuntu desktop from a windows laptop through a home router. how do i do this?
[03:05] <kitche> joeshmo: how full?
[03:05] <rajiv_nair> abt70%:D
[03:05] <joeshmo> well mine is cuz im running wine
[03:05] <LjL> yoshig3: 9629 even
[03:05] <joeshmo> like 5 mb left
[03:05] <joeshmo> lemme get exact
[03:05] <peacekpr> sethk, that's probably the reason... the file says it was overwritten a couple of hours ago... i wonder why - maybe when i reinstalled the cups packages (?)
[03:05] <yoshig3> LjL: But I got that error at first with the repository
[03:05] <rajiv_nair> joeshno: u hv xgl/beryl running?? :>
[03:05] <joeshmo> 6000K ish free
[03:05] <yoshig3> LjL: Then a software update icon popped up
[03:05] <sethk> peacekpr, possibly.  here's mine:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36537/
[03:05] <yoshig3> LjL: And gave meh this
[03:06] <joeshmo> no it sonly full cuz im running wine + installing counterstrike
[03:06] <joeshmo> but i wish it would use the swap
[03:06] <kitche> joeshmo: that's 6 megs I have seen swap no get used until 1 meg was free
[03:06] <yoshig3> LjL: Alright, gonna try a restart.
[03:06] <ozoneco> how do you tell the partitions and types on a system?
[03:06] <rajiv_nair> kitchie: thnx for da info:)
[03:06] <LjL> yoshig3: that error was saying that Ubuntu didn't know the cryptographic keys for that nvidia repository. which is certainly normal, since it's not an official repository. if you want the error to go away, you need to add the key, following what the bot told you
[03:06] <joeshmo>  really well wouldnt you think its just managing it so that it DOESN"T get all the mem used?
[03:06] <kortec> hey guys -- how do i get back in to the installer menu's package chooser after the install? kind of forgot to install a desktop . .
[03:06] <peacekpr> sethk, this is interesting... so where is the HTTP cups interface pulling the network printer info from?  I guess it's pulling it from a query of port 631 on the network?
[03:06] <joeshmo> im gonna open tons of shit and see if it uses it
[03:06] <robdeman> should I use ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-dsktop?
[03:07] <rajiv_nair> mem is much faster thatn swap

[03:08] <sethk> peacekpr, I'm not sure.  I know that on my most recent linux install, it located the print server automgically during the install and set up the configuration.
[03:08] <LjL> Spaghetti_Knife: look at what ubotu said *above*, when rajiv_nair said !register
[03:08] <somerville32> Spaghetti_Knife, /join ##java

[03:08] <rajiv_nair> type /msg NickServ IDENTIFY <password>
[03:08] <joeshmo> i had to mkswap and swapon manually tho.  i suppose to get it auto has something to do with FSTAB?
[03:08] <ozoneco> how do i see what my swap file size is?
[03:09] <joeshmo> type top in terminal
[03:09] <sethk> peacekpr, I'll be in and out, but since we have nearly the same configuration, we should be able to figure out why mine works and yours' doesn't.
[03:09] <sethk> peacekpr, I'll be back in a bit.  although possibly it will work after you set up that file.

[03:16] <yoshig3> Amaranth: that was weird. After first restart of installing the drivers, it wouldn't load X. I tried to get to terminal, but it didn't show. Just a black screen where I could type. So I restarted again, and it loaded.
[03:16] <Mastastealth> vader: wuts the problem?
[03:16] <dirle> had used 2 types of installation not listed under 6.10
[03:16] <peacekpr> sethk, you aren't going to believe this... the firewall "Firestarter" was preventing the client from getting into port 631
[03:16] <Amaranth> yoshig3: odd
[03:16] <ozoneco> kitche: go thru the directions, then the pc doesn't start
[03:16] <fbc> What is causing my gxine to crash X?
[03:16] <LjL> Amaranth: latest -security l-r-m package is 2.6.17.6-1
[03:16] <Cubed> mastastealth:
[03:16] <VGambit> I did sudo update-manager -c, the update ran for a few hours, then locked up and crashed while setting up gnopernicus. any ideas?
[03:16] <Cubed> mastastealth:
[03:16] <Cubed> anybody?...
[03:16] <peacekpr> sethk, i went to allow traffic on 631 and out pops the test page from the client
[03:16] <Cubed> i got a problem with my wireless - it won't load back up after i reboot. i have already blacklisted the default driver.... any other solutions?
[03:16] <yoshig3> Amaranth: that's what I was saying
[03:16] <Amaranth> LjL: i don't know what my version is :)
[03:16] <vader> Mastastealth, when it gets to where the X should start it gives the errors cannot start X
[03:16] <Mastastealth> Cubed: what wireless device?
[03:17] <LjL> Amaranth: .... :P it's 2.6.17.6-2~amaranth
[03:17] <Cubed> masta: netgear ma111
[03:17] <peacekpr> sethk, thanks for your help!!
[03:17] <Mastastealth> vader: what's the specific details X spits out?
[03:17] <vader> one sec will boot it to get them
[03:17] <yoshig3> LjL and Amaranth: thanks for the help so far!
[03:17] <kitche> ozoneco: that seems odd you following the ubuntu grub how-to?
[03:17] <Cubed> masta: it works fine, i know it does i used it before. but after 2 reboots it won't load back up
[03:17] <ozoneco> kitche: its the nst how-to
[03:17] <Mastastealth> Cubed: how did you run it before? with native drivers out ndiswrapper?
[03:18] <Cubed> masta: typing the ifconfig eth0 down or whatever, i tried that once and it worked. now it won't
[03:18] <kitche> ozoneco: try this one !grub
[03:18] <Cubed> masta: ndiswrapper and ndisgtk
[03:18] <ozoneco> !grub
[03:18] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[03:18] <Cubed> masta: i know it works properly, the drivers are ok, hardware detected
[03:18] <VGambit> I'll try rebooting for now
[03:18] <Mastastealth> Cubed: Ok, so if you type ifconfig, can you see an IP on the adaper?
[03:19] <tom_kelleher> fatalcure;  gxine seems to work really well per schisms's recommendation
[03:19] <Cubed> masta: it's just that there is no connection in the network manager
[03:19] <schisms> See?
[03:19] <LjL> Amaranth: at any rate, there is version 9631 available from http://www.albertomilone.com (keeps a repository, is an ubuntu member), perhaps we could change the factoid to point to it if you're not maintaining yours anymore?
[03:19] <schisms> Totem is terrible when used for anything outside of vorbis
[03:19] <rajiv_nair> schisms: i wldnt say that
[03:19] <schisms> I was happy myself when I realized there was a clickable menu
[03:19] <tom_kelleher> now how do I make gxine load automatically instead of the other app.
[03:20] <rajiv_nair> schisms: totem plays all of ma vids
[03:20] <Cubed> masta: not sure if i can, i haven't tried that. all i know is when i type ndiswrapper -l , everything is installed properly
[03:20] <schisms> I wonder why.
[03:20] <Amaranth> LjL: oh, that *explitive deleted* actually has a repository with a modified l-r-m? i thought he just had scripts to automate installing the .run files
[03:20] <Mastastealth> tom_kelleher: Right click on the video file, and you will see the application used to launch it, then default it
[03:20] <ttyfscker> anybody know of a repo that has iceweasel 2 in it?
[03:20] <votum76> anyone know of a program that is like windows editplus with syntax highlighting and support for editing on sftp servers
[03:20] <Amaranth> ttyfscker: nope, just firefox 2
[03:20] <ttyfscker> yea i know that much
[03:20] <Mastastealth> Cubed: Ok, then try ifconfig, and see if the adapter (I assume wlan0) has an IP from your router
[03:21] <Amaranth> votum76: Ubuntu comes with one of those, Applications->Accessories->Text Editor
[03:21] <tom_kelleher> Mastastealth;  it's not a file though, it's a DVD
[03:21] <AlphaN3> votum76: vi, emacs
[03:21] <Mastastealth> tom_kelleher: Oh...uhm...not sure then! :X
[03:21] <LjL> Amaranth: l-r-m and nvidia-glx, and the vmware modules to go with those, yes. i take that as, leave the factoid alone :P
[03:21] <Amaranth> AlphaN3: Don't tell someone to use emacs, you'll scare them off ;)
[03:21] <ttyfscker> i found the deb package for iceweasel 2 but the deps are all screwed up.. its for debian not ubuntu.. if i try to install it, it needs firefox removed and then wants to remove gnome-core and a bunch of other things i use
[03:21] <tom_kelleher> anybody know how to switch the default app for DVD?
[03:21] <Amaranth> LjL: I'm a bit wary of his work
[03:21] <vader> Mastastealth, I am letting it boot right now, it do take a few :)
[03:21] <Cubed> masta: i will definitely try that. i gotta boot to my other hard drive....... see you in about 8 if it doesn't work =) thanx
[03:22] <Cubed> masta: btw, it is wlan0
[03:22] <votum76> I coudn't find any sftp support in that
[03:22] <Mastastealth> vader: roger
[03:22] <Mastastealth> ^_^
[03:22] <Amaranth> LjL: I'll update my package to 9631 when feisty does ;)
[03:22] <Mastastealth> ok Cubed
[03:22] <squeakypants> hey hey hey
[03:22] <AlphaN3> heh
[03:22] <squeakypants> what's the easiest way to install the legacy nvidia drivers and beryl or compiz or whatever?
[03:23] <AlphaN3> Um.. I'm having problem getting xchat's locale to work
[03:23] <vader> Mastastealth, I did try someting new this time, I am trying 640x480 to see if it goes through this time
[03:23] <AlphaN3> I am a regular of many channels that do not use English, yet not everyone uses UTF-8
[03:23] <Mastastealth> vader: yea, that'd be good. I'm not sure of any cards that don't work with the default and lowres vesa. If anything you'll have to manually install your intel drivers for higher rez's
[03:24] <vader> it is just sitting there now, looks like it is hung
[03:24] <whyameye> votum76: why don't you just go to "places --> connect to server" then sftp into your remote unit. Then right-click on the file you want to edit and user the Gnome text editor as suggested?
[03:24] <AlphaN3> I used to be able to configure it such that texts in the ASCII 128-255 range would be mapped to my specific locale, but I've forgotten how to do it
[03:24] <Amaranth> LjL: btw, according to his site he only has 9626
[03:25] <Mastastealth> vader: X is just sitting there? You see your mouse or no?
[03:25] <AlphaN3> Anyone knows of anything that might help? It involves creating a wrapper shell script, and export locale=something, etc.
[03:25] <Mastastealth> And what card do you have exactly?
[03:25] <votum76> that might work
[03:26] <Vishnu> I can't accesss to a webpage untill i restart my router. After restarting router, I have a few seconds to see the page . How to fix this problem ?
[03:26] <Mastastealth> squeakypants: You already have the legacy drivers installed?
[03:27] <fuffe> why is there no suppoort for ctrl C in the terminal
[03:27] <whyameye> Vishnu: I take it this is wireless?
[03:27] <LjL> Amaranth: not if you look at the "unsable" page
[03:27] <rastilin> fuffe, Ctrl+C is the terminate command
[03:27] <fuffe> or ctrl-V for that sake
[03:27] <Mastastealth> ^_^
[03:27] <LjL> Amaranth: err, i mean - the opposite
[03:27] <Mastastealth> Ctrl-V is Shift-Ctrl-V in a terminal
[03:28] <Vishnu> nonot wireless.
[03:28] <Mastastealth> I don't know copy...I just use right click on those...
[03:28] <LjL> Amaranth: http://www.albertomilone.com/driver_edgy.html anyway
[03:28] <Amaranth> LjL: that doesn't make much sense :)
[03:28] <Jeffm515> whats the command to change password?
[03:28] <fuffe> and ctrl C is is Shift-Ctrl-C?
[03:28] <LjL> Jeffm515: passwd
[03:28] <squeakypants> nvm it isn't legacy
[03:28] <LjL> Amaranth: *shrug*
[03:28] <Softly> confidential
[03:28] <Vishnu> just this page:  http://www.gzschool.com.cn
[03:28] <Jeffm515> thanks LjL
[03:29] <Amaranth> LjL: err, he doesn't have source packages?
[03:29] <Mastastealth> fuffe: Don't know, it probably tells you in the terminal menu, where you can click on it...
[03:29] <yoshig3> what's the command to backup my xorg?
[03:29] <jrib> how can I disable all menu accelerators in GNOME?
[03:29] <Mastastealth> yoshig3: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.cong.bkup ?
[03:29] <rastilin> toshig3 "cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf <target>"
[03:30] <klotho> hello... I was wondering, if I have an existing XP installation, can I install ubuntu on it without having to reinstall xp?
[03:30] <Mastastealth> klotho: yup
[03:30] <dirle> I am trying to dual boot vista and ubuntu.. sadly it can't be done without a third party software.. so far I found out about GAG.. but is there something out here that I should know about?
[03:30] <klotho> thanks Mastastealth. is there a particular procedure I should follow?
[03:30] <sc4ttrbrain> !synaptics
[03:30] <ubotu> For a comprehensive Synaptics Touchpad guide, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticsTouchpad
[03:31] <dirle> anyoen?
[03:31] <dirle> *anyone?
[03:31] <LjL> Amaranth: hmm, guess not. or maybe he does, since it says "binary/" in the APT line, but going to "source/" or "sources/" doesn't work, and the directories aren't browsable
[03:31] <Mastastealth> klotho: Most people just shrink their windows partition to leave room for the Ubuntu partitions, which you can do during install
[03:31] <dirle> doesn't work
[03:31] <tonyyarusso> dirle: Why does it take third party software for Vista?  (Doesn't for XP)
[03:31] <klotho> I tried that with an existing Win2000 installation and it said it couldn't shrink it
[03:32] <dirle> dunno.. for some reason they interfere
[03:32] <rastilin> klotho, Ubuntu won't shrink it, you need partition magic.
[03:32] <klotho> oic
[03:32] <Mastastealth> klotho: you'll probably want to defrag your windows partition before you do it
[03:32] <tonyyarusso> dirle: Do you have any more detail on that?
[03:32] <dirle> was using acronis disk director.. then gparted.. and still can't dual boot
=== defend is now known as Defend
[03:32] <paradox34690> GCC isn't installed by default in 6.10, is it?
[03:32] <klotho> I thought unbuntu supposedly would do it in the install
[03:32] <dirle> what u need tony
[03:32] <dirle> ?
[03:32] <Vishnu> whyameye  its not a wireless device . Just a D-link Router , anything to suggest?
[03:32] <czedlitz> anyone had any success with 3D things with a Dell Inspiron 6000 ?
[03:32] <Mastastealth> rastilin: Ubuntu can shrink Windows partition, Edgy comes with Gparted...
[03:32] <tonyyarusso> dirle: Grub config would be a good start.
[03:33] <rastilin> NTFS partitions?
[03:33] <Mastastealth> yup
[03:33] <Mastastealth> it resized mine
[03:33] <dirle> grub config?.. gparted u mean right?
[03:33] <klotho> mine are fat32 because I'm a late adopter
[03:33] <Mastastealth> ;) even better
[03:33] <LjL> paradox34690: no it isn't... it's on the CD though
[03:33] <Mastastealth> I guess, since you can write on them safely as well! ^_^
[03:33] <tonyyarusso> dirle: No - grub is the bootloader Ubuntu uses, and would be what you use to chainload to the windows boot.ini
[03:33] <eyequeue> paradox34690, sudo apt-get build-essential
[03:33] <LjL> Ubotu, tell paradox34690 about build-essential | paradox34690, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:33] <Mastastealth> czedlitz: Inspiron 9300 with 3d working here...
[03:34] <paradox34690> thanks ;)
[03:34] <KanRiNiN> Hello.  VLC runs DVDs quite slowly compared with totem-xine, but I use it on windows and would like to make it run faster.  It's using X11 output as OpenGL and Xv don't seem to run under Beryl/AIGLX
[03:34] <czedlitz> what video card?
[03:34] <klotho> how is unbuntu's support for an IBM T-series notebook?
[03:34] <Mastastealth> czedlitz: Just depends on the card. Mine is an Nvidia GeforceGo 6800
[03:34] <Mastastealth> klotho: from what I've heard, IBM support is great
[03:34] <dirle> I will research on grub config then
[03:34] <Mastastealth> !laptop
[03:34] <ubotu> Laptop support information can be found on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportMachinesLaptops - http://www.linux-laptop.net/ - http://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam - http://tuxmobil.org
[03:34] <AlphaN3> I don't know why someone would choose totem over anything :/
[03:34] <tonyyarusso> !dualboot | dirle

[03:34] <tonyyarusso> to get you started
[03:34] <czedlitz> oh ok, should rephrase my question then.  Intel Chip integrated card....
[03:35] <czedlitz> i think an i915
[03:35] <klotho> okay, thanks for the tips
[03:35] <Mastastealth> !i915
[03:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i915 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:35] <Mastastealth> Hmm, 'm pretty sure Intel works out of the box
[03:35] <Mastastealth> except you might need a program to change resolutions
[03:35] <Kim^J> Need some help with xbindkeys. How do I set so I use Windows button + some other key?
[03:36] <lubix> what is channell to get help with my xchat
[03:36] <czedlitz> Mastastealth, ok, well so far so good, rez is 1280
[03:36] <tonyyarusso> !winkey | Kim^J
[03:36] <ubotu> Kim^J: To use the windows key in keyboard shortcuts as a modifier (like ALT): Run 'xmodmap' and see what Super_L corresponds to.  Then follow method B at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79560 and use <mod4> (or whatever Super_L corresponded to with 'xmodmap') as the modifier. For example, a shortcut to use windows key + d would look like '<mod4>d'
[03:36] <czedlitz> Mastastealth, so we will see
[03:36] <dirle> done that tony
[03:36] <Pelo> lubix,  this is a channel to get help with ubuntu ,  we'll deal with related xchat issues
[03:36] <tonyyarusso> dirle: Okay.  What step do you run into trouble at?  Can you boot Ubuntu and just not Windows?  Any useful error output?

[03:39] <gpd> what's the deal with the beryl repositories for edgy? half of mine are 404 these days
[03:39] <dirle> there it goes.. I used acronis disk director to put more free space on C: so I could dual boot ubuntu.. had problems since then.. somehow the MBR got disturbed by the move even thou it was successful.. then I said let's try ubuntu first.. and I like it.. a lot.. even thou I'm noob ;).. anyway.. have installed ubuntu on the primary partition using gparted.. main and swap ones as well.. and when I went to install vista.. it didn't let me boo
[03:39] <Mastastealth> gpd: yea, check their site for the latest SVN repos...
[03:39] <Mastastealth> gpd: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/SVN
[03:40] <linux_kid> dirle: do you have more than 4 primary partitions?
[03:40] <gpd> Mastastealth: thanks :)
[03:40] <tonyyarusso> dirle: Ah, that's the problem.
[03:40] <dirle> no.. 1 for ntfs.. 1q for ex3? and swap
[03:40] <Mastastealth> gpd: No prob, was on vacation for some weeks to find the same thing! :)
[03:40] <linux_kid> dirle: ok, and sata or other
[03:40] <tonyyarusso> dirle: Windows is really stupide, and requires that it be installed on the first partition.  Install Windows first, and then Ubuntu after it.
[03:40] <Arigato> is there any way to check computer power usage (as in kWh)?
[03:40] <whyameye> Vishnu: is the router losing connection or a computer connected to the router?
[03:40] <Mastastealth> linux_kid: isnt that impossible? ;) You can only have 2 primaries...
[03:41] <dirle> sata HDD
[03:41] <gpd> how about nvidia drivers -- my amaranth.selfip also gone
[03:41] <dirle> 3 extensions
[03:41] <dirle> done that tony

[03:41] <Mastastealth> the albertomilone ones
[03:41] <Mastastealth> I actually had to use the "envy" script to get mine working
[03:42] <dirle> but I blew the MBR every time
[03:42] <linux_kid> dirle: ok, so is windows showing up in grub
[03:42] <tonyyarusso> dirle: You'll be rewriting the MBR in the Ubuntu install anyway
[03:42] <dirle> dunno much about grub

[03:44] <dirle> on it already linux_kid.. ty .. and to u2 tony
[03:44] <linux_kid> fuffalo, i salute you
[03:44] <tonyyarusso> fuffalo: SharpMusique can use the iTunes store I think

[03:45] <fuffalo> provided they are ok ;p

[03:46] <Vaske_Car> how to login to antoher linux box via SSH?
[03:47] <VishnuSY> so I guess my route works well.
[03:47] <linux_kid> Mastastealth: alfa usually means wait till beta
[03:47] <ubun> songbird has ipod support built in now?
[03:47] <Mastastealth> linux_kid: yea, but you never know when someone is interested in the lastest bleeding edge ;)
[03:47] <linux_kid> good point
[03:47] <w3ccv> Mastastealth, where is songbird
[03:48] <Mastastealth> ubun: not that I know of...o.O but it's obviously planned
[03:48] <Mastastealth> w3ccv: lemme look for a deb...
[03:48] <ubun> how can anything count as a good itunes clone if it doesnt have ipod support :P
[03:48] <spx2> ubuntu gives me great satisfaction now i have all i want on it!!! :D
[03:48] <eric__> hi
[03:48] <w3ccv> ubun, my thought too
[03:48] <ubun> thats the only thing i used itunes for, certainly not for a player
[03:49] <spx2> ubun m4v is the only thing it needs to be a good ipod clone i think
[03:49] <linux_kid> ubun: just wine itunes, if you really want itunes support
[03:49] <ubun> amarok has ipod support
[03:49] <spx2> ubun or getting a m4v converter might help
[03:49] <KG4KIN> lshw doesn't show my pci wifi card.  How can I fix this?
[03:50] <yoshig3> LjL: I installed beryl. What's this thing supposed to do?
[03:50] <w3ccv> amarok didn't work for me, iirc too many unfulfilled depencancies.  I use YamiPod
[03:50] <LjL> yoshig3: uh... if you don't know, why did you install it? :D
[03:50] <ubun> beryl is supposed to drop your jaw then eventually you get tired of it and go back to gnome/kde
[03:50] <yoshig3> Oh, and what's the command to run glxgears with fps?
[03:50] <yoshig3> LjL: lol, well, people told me that it would get rid of the lagginess that I am experiencing from windows
[03:50] <linux_kid> K54KIN: how far have you got...?

[03:50] <Mastastealth> ubun: I've been running it since compiz, I ain't bored yet! :D
[03:51] <LjL> yoshig3: nonsense
[03:51] <Vaske_Car> how to check CHMOD from shell?
[03:51] <LjL> yoshig3: Beryl is something that gives you funny desktop effects.
[03:51] <ubun> Mastastealth: your eyes might get diabetes from all that candy, becareful :P
[03:51] <LjL> Ubotu, tell yoshig3 about beryl | yoshig3, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:51] <Mastastealth> lol
[03:51] <Cubed> masta............
[03:51] <Cubed> i'm back
[03:51] <Cubed> so it's bad newz
[03:51] <yoshig3> LjL: Well what is XGL then!?
[03:51] <fatalcure> Vaske_Car: ls -l
[03:51] <Mastastealth> oh noez
[03:51] <KG4KIN> I installed the card and loaded the driver with ndiswrapper but the card doesn't show in network settings or lshw
[03:51] <Mastastealth> XGL is something you don't need to worry about if you use beryl in Edgy :P
[03:51] <Crescendo__> So - how do I go about recompiling a kernel?
[03:52] <Cubed> masta: i did ifconfig wlan0 and my ip address was there. keep in mind i set my router up for static and it did work before
[03:52] <fatalcure> !kernelcompile | Crescendo__
[03:52] <ubotu> Crescendo__: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[03:52] <Cubed> what could be the prob?
[03:52] <Mastastealth> http://www.songbirdnest.com/thankyou/?sb_version=021&platform=linux-i686  <--Songbird, it looks like it might have iPod support already, but I don't know for sure...
[03:52] <LjL> yoshig3: an X server that has provisions to allow things like Beryl to run.  if you have Edgy, which has similar provisions (in the form of something called AIGLX) embedded, and a recent driver in case you have an NVidia card (like you do), you don't need Xgl
[03:53] <yoshig3> LjL: Well why are all my windows drawing slow then?? They lag all over the screen, like on top of Mozilla and just in general?
[03:53] <Mastastealth> Cubed: so your adapter gets an IP via static...can you ping anything? A network PC, or an online site like www.google.com ?
[03:53] <CaBlGuY> how would I go about changing the application a certiain file type is opened with?
[03:53] <CaBlGuY> I'm using Gnome in 6.10
[03:53] <Cubed> masta: i know what ping is, but have never used it
[03:53] <fatalcure> !defaultapp | CaBlGuY
[03:53] <ubotu> CaBlGuY: To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties -> Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror -> Settings -> Configure and then hit "File Associations"
[03:53] <LjL> yoshig3: while using Beryl or while not using it? if while using it, well, it was very slow for me as well when i tried it
[03:53] <Cubed> masta: i doubt i can
[03:54] <yoshig3> LjL: While NOT using it. I think I may be running better with Beryl.
[03:54] <Cubed> masta: something is stopping me from configuring my wireless in the network settings
[03:54] <Mastastealth> Cubed: just do -- ping <adress> -- where address is a network IP or a website
[03:54] <linux_kid> Nvidia and linux just dont go together.  we are all linux junkies or else we wouldn't be in this irc channel.  why do we NEED ATi and Nvidia drivers if we cannot even play games on linux...   thats what the cards are for!!!
[03:54] <Mastastealth> if it doesn't resond, then you are'nt connect to your router
[03:54] <LjL> yoshig3: what's your computer like? processor, memory, graphics card?
[03:54] <sc4ttrbrain> warning to anyone using trevino`s repository, installing xserver-xorg related package POSSIBLY make your alps touchpad losing scroll function !!
[03:54] <Mastastealth> oh! better yet, try pinging the IP of your router! :P
[03:54] <LjL> yoshig3: pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you don't mind
[03:54] <robdeman> could anybody help me with 'why is my X desktop empty and has only a terminal window when connecting to tightvncserver' issue?
[03:55] <yoshig3> LjL: The windows draw slow. not EXTREMELY slow, but it's enough for say: I open mozilla, and I open a terminal. Say I drag the terminal around, on top of mozilla. It draws multiple windows until I stop dragging.
[03:55] <Trevinho> sc4ttr
[03:55] <Cubed> masta: lol that makes sense, since the router is "first in line" of what i can access
[03:55] <CaBlGuY> very good fatalcure gracie..  :)
[03:55] <Trevinho> doesn't it work for you?
[03:55] <Trevinho> :o
[03:55] <sc4ttrbrain> Trevinho: :D sorry man
[03:55] <rastilin> robdeman, to save on bandwith updating the desktop and to save on RAM with running the server
[03:55] <Trevinho> no problems ;P
[03:55] <yoshig3> Intel 2.4Ghz Celeron, 512MB RAM, 40GB HD and a GeForce4 MX 4000 PCI 128MB DDR.
[03:55] <robdeman> rastlin: but how can I get a full Ubuntu desktop?
[03:55] <sc4ttrbrain> Trevinho: just fixed it using ubuntu defaulat package
[03:55] <Trevinho> anyway the only package related to touchpad is the synaptic one
[03:55] <rastilin> robdeman, there should be a configuration file where you configure the desktop
[03:56] <Trevinho> mh, ok.... I should update it maybe.......
[03:56] <yoshig3> !pastebin
[03:56] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[03:56] <LjL> yoshig3: it does that here too. lasts like about a tenth of a second though, after i've stopped moving the window - and the window itself moves fine (while with beryl, the moving itself is sluggish here)
[03:56] <Trevinho> thanks for reporting ;)
[03:56] <Cubed> masta: do you have any other ideas? i mean windows is slow as hell for me right now and booting between two hard disks is a pain in the ass
[03:56] <Mastastealth> "Nvidia and linux just dont go together" Why if NVIDIA has great linux drivers? And from what I've read you can play AMerica's Army, Unreal, Neverwinter NIghts, DOom 3 and a bunch others
=== Crescendo__ is now known as Crescendo
[03:56] <LjL> yoshig3: are you sure Windows does much better than that? i haven't used Windows on this computer for some time, but
[03:56] <cafuego_> Mastastealth: Yes, but.
[03:56] <dirle> I have reintalled vista last night.. and after ubuntu.. and of course Vista is unbootable atm.. with restoring grub now.. I will have access to Vista?
[03:56] <kranky> I have a odd question. Whenever I go out to the net, web pages or getting updates, there seems to be a pause between when I request a page to when it starts downloading. Goes a lot quicker in WinXP. Any ideas?
[03:56] <yoshig3> LjL: Yeah, the window draws itself fine, but lags around, like I stated before. Yes, in windows I didnt' experience any of this.
[03:57] <robdeman> rastilin: mmm is that /root/.vnc/xstartup ?
[03:57] <sc4ttrbrain> Trevinho: yeah, ur beryl repo has been amazing, but synaptics run clumsy when using your synaptic
[03:57] <Cubed> it really sucks my internet goes out after i install compiz
[03:57] <cafuego_> Mastastealth: Performance is fine, but for example last month we found out the nvidia binary driver contains a root hole which can be exploited by making an nvidia user visit a website
[03:57] <rastilin> rodbdeman, looks right
[03:57] <Mastastealth> Cubed, well if you can't ping your router, then I really don't know. If you manually add static IP stuff to your adapter, Network Manager will ignore it, and won't use its magic on it...you can always check the wireless troubeshooting guide on the uBuntu wiki
[03:57] <fatalcure> !ipv6 | kranky
[03:57] <ubotu> kranky: To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[03:57] <robdeman> rastilin: what should I put in it to make Ubuntu show in full effect?
[03:57] <unixslut`> secret
[03:57] <cafuego_> Mastastealth: They are NOT particularly fast in releasing a fix.
[03:57] <Mastastealth> cafugeo_: wasnt that the one in the 96xx beta drivers?
[03:57] <Cubed> masta: i'll keep it in mind. thanx a lot for helping us poor n00bs
[03:58] <Mastastealth> Cubed: lol, no prob, have fun! ;)
[03:58] <rastilin> rodbdeman, No clue. Show initiative. Just keep a copy of the file around.
[03:58] <kranky> thanks fatalcure
[03:58] <cafuego_> Mastastealth: nope, all
[03:59] <yoshig3> LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36545/
[03:59] <Mastastealth> cafuego: huh...haven't heard of it. That very well could be true, but I guess that's why we should support that open-source nvidia driver group :)
[03:59] <Cubed> mastastealth: one more thing....... if i say fuck it and use DHCP... then my wireless connection should be ok? i prefer static because of my nintendo DS and PSP
[03:59] <Mastastealth> Cubed: it might help let Network Manger deal with the conenction, but its no guarantee ;)
[03:59] <cafuego_> Mastastealth: I instead gave money to intel and ended up with an open driver that does 3d well enough for me.
[03:59] <robdeman> rastilin: well Im trying for a few hours now ;)
[04:00] <Cubed> masta: ok thanx, cya
[04:00] <lambo4jos> how can i disable ubuntus firewall?  is there a firewall installed in the default configuration?
[04:00] <rastilin> lambo4jos, no
[04:00] <brian111> Hey everyone
[04:00] <fatalcure> lambo4jos: no
[04:00] <brian111> Im having trouble with hibernation
[04:00] <dirle> I have the option to boot in ubuntu and in vista when I boot the PC.. is that GRUB?.. and if it is.. will restoring it will fix the MBR?
[04:00] <brian111> My computer kind of just stopped being able to hibernatie
[04:00] <rastilin> robdeman, Have you tried "gnome-session"?
[04:00] <brian111> hibernate
[04:00] <tonyyarusso> !firewall | lambo4jos
[04:00] <ubotu> lambo4jos: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:00] <brian111> I get a swap error and says try swapon -a
[04:01] <brian111> which i did, and did not work
[04:01] <brian111> gave some error
[04:01] <robdeman> rastilin ah
[04:01] <Mastastealth> dirle: that sound slike GRUB...what do ou mean "restoring it will fix MBR". If you have GRUB isn't hte MBR fine?
[04:01] <Limulf> I'm beginning to use GnuPG. To start building my "web of trust", it would be safe to mark the key of the person who signs all the Ubuntu Security newsletter as a trusted one, wouldn't it? (I have checked the key ID remains the same through a lot of mails and at his personal page at the Ubuntu Wiki)
[04:01] <dirle> nope.. the damn vista doesn't want to boot
[04:01] <dirle> it will reboot my pc instead
[04:02] <Music_Shuffle> dirle, don't you need 3rd party progs to dual-boot if using Vista?
[04:02] <brian111> Anyone have any ideas for the hibernation issue?
[04:02] <Limulf> (all the Ubuntu Security newsletter mail, I mean)
[04:03] <LjL> yoshig3: yes, i'm here. i don't really know what to do about that, though, as i said the same happens here (at least from what you described), and i always considered it normal. the only thing (though i doubt it's related) is that perhaps you should have Option "Composite" "Enable" rather than "Disable" (last three lines of the xorg.conf)
[04:03] <Mastastealth> http://www.pro-networks.org/forum/about78184.html
[04:03] <dirle> it seems so.. and that's why I'm here.. so far I got some research on GAG.. but is there anything else out there I should look on?
[04:03] <Crescendo> What are the default permissions on /home/eric/.ssh/known_hosts
[04:03] <Crescendo> ?
[04:03] <robdeman> rastilin: nice that works. Is this a new session or something? or does it hijakc teh current session?
[04:03] <yoshig3> LjL: what would that do?
[04:03] <mike> This is a noob question but
[04:04] <mike> How do I chmod directories as root?
[04:04] <yoshig3> !composite
[04:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about composite - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:04] <LjL> Ubotu, tell mike about sudo | mike, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:04] <tonyyarusso> Limulf: It would not be an "Ultimate" trust level, but you can mark it to something, yes.  Ultimate means you met in person and checked ID, next down would be you have a reasonably short chain of people to that point.  So maybe level three down from the top.  Also, there's a nice GPG tutorial on some other aspects of usage at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ClassroomTranscripts :)  (Shameless self-promo)
[04:04] <w3ccv> Crescendo, looks like 644
[04:05] <fatalcure> Limulf: I think the web-of-trust works on personal contact (eg. at keysigning functions).  It would be better to trust a key (of someone you meet in person) that trusts a key that ... that trusts that key
[04:05] <LjL> yoshig3: enable the composite extension, which is normally enabled by default in Edgy, afaik. but i think turning it off would, at worst, remove some desktop effects (but i don't think any are enabled, either), when you're not using Beryl. when you're using Beryl, it might need to be enabled, i don't really know.
[04:05] <Crescendo> w3ccv, and who is the owner?
[04:05] <w3ccv> Crescendo, the user
[04:05] <Limulf> xd thanks a lot, I'll read it
[04:05] <yoshig3> LjL: Well I'm using beryl right now with it off and it's working fine
[04:05] <Crescendo> Thanks.
[04:05] <stephan21> can someone tell me how do i get mplayer for edgy
[04:06] <yoshig3> stephan21: Oh boy you have to live with charter too?

[04:07] <dirle> part of the reasons I'm having problems dual booting it seems
[04:07] <yoshig3> LjL: So enabling it with beryl isn't gonna kill me right?
[04:07] <tarsier> can somebody help me understand this error: invoke-rc.d: initscript samba, action "start" failed. dpkg: error processing samba (--configure):subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1

[04:08] <valmarko> tanks
[04:08] <brian111> anyone have anyclue about hibernation not working anymore
[04:08] <gogeta> you need to support acpi for hibernation to work
[04:08] <Pelo> brian111,   no , check the forum for sleep problmes
[04:08] <cafuego_> it's climate change, too warm for too long for hibernating
[04:08] <brian111> I have
[04:09] <brian111> I get a weird error
[04:09] <brian111> it isn't mentioned
[04:09] <brian111> It tells me to try enabling swap
[04:09] <ausimage> anyone no any issues with wide screen LCDS a local store has both wide and normal width 19" ones.
[04:09] <ausimage> s/no/know
[04:10] <LjL> yoshig3: i doubt it... but you certainly do want to make a backup of your xorg.conf before ever modifying it, and to be ready to restore the backup from a console
[04:10] <brian111> okay well thanks anyway, ill ask and keep looking tomorrow
[04:10] <ausimage> I am thinking of getting the wide but do not want to have too many headaches
[04:11] <brian111> Mine works fine ausimage
[04:11] <ausimage> I do use Ubunutu edgy exclusively
[04:11] <brian111> 1024x800
[04:11] <brian111> It just worked right off the bat.
[04:11] <brian111> and by 1024 I meant 1280
[04:11] <ski-worklap> anyone have problems with sun's jvm & azureus on edgy?
[04:11] <ausimage> cool I wanted to check first before getting it
[04:11] <yoshig3> Anyone know what the extension Composite does?
[04:11] <ausimage> thanks brian11
[04:12] <brian111> Not azureus, but frostwire for sure...
[04:12] <brian111> I can't get frostwire.
[04:12] <brian111> yoshig3: composite extensions are for transparency effects
[04:12] <stephan21> whats the official edgy how to / support site
[04:12] <brian111> with the ati driver you can't have 3d and transparency(composite)
[04:12] <Pelo> brian111,  get the beta package for ubuntu  from the blog section of the site
[04:12] <yoshig3> damn....
[04:12] <brian111> What beta package?

[04:24] <ubotu> For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[04:24] <Carutsu> or something
[04:24] <mister_roboto> rc-1: update-java-alternatives
[04:24] <tonyyarusso> AndreNoel: Okay, here's what I'm finding: Nothing definite, but people/places you can try contacting are Ben Mako Hill, Matthew East, or Dennis Kaarsemaker, or in #launchpad.  One person thought it should automatically change a few days after changing your LP id.

[04:33] <Music_Shuffle> I know I've never experienced slow graphical response on ubuntu.
[04:34] <funkyHat> burnhamd, not all repositories have keys, sometimes you just have to ignore the warnings if you want to use those repositories
[04:34] <yoshig3> See wh at I mean
[04:34] <haxality> yoshig3: it could be a number of things. I'd start by checking if you have the right video driver installed
[04:34] <yoshig3> haxality: I do
[04:34] <burnhamd> this one does have a key
[04:34] <n30n> funkyHat: I mean is it a background package or do i need to be trying to run it
[04:34] <haxality> what video card is it, yoshig3
[04:34] <yoshig3> haxality: tried the old nvidia drivers and the new ones, have new ones in now, they both run the same
[04:35] <yoshig3> haxality: nVidia GeForce4 MX 4000 128MB DDR PCI
[04:35] <julow> can someone help w/ my sound card.  its driving me nuts
[04:35] <haxality> hm.
[04:35] <funkyHat> n30n, it will launch automatically on login once it's installed
[04:35] <avis> i have found graphical response on edgy is slightly more than it was on dapper
[04:35] <haxality> I don't know, then. I have had minimal experience with linux graphics problems
[04:35] <mister_roboto> yoshig3: have you tried hitting the "turbo" button?    :)
[04:35] <n30n> funkyHat: Restart required?
[04:35] <haxality> yes, I couldn't even run edgy on this computer
[04:35] <yoshig3> mister_roboto: I don't have that...
[04:35] <funkyHat> n30n, no, just log out/in, restarts on Linux are all but never required :)
[04:35] <mister_roboto> yoshig3: sorry, bad joke :)

[04:56] <Varanger> Hello
[04:56] <Vaske_Car_> how to SAVE file edited with VI ?
[04:56] <joeljkp> kuto: oh, sorry
[04:56] <yoshig3> funkyHat: I installed beryl correctly, composite is not enabled though. I saw at server webpages that enabling compsite will cause xserver not to start. Should I enable it?
[04:56] <Varanger> hello people
[04:56] <joeljkp> kuto: ##windows
[04:56] <n30n> eth1 status: disconnected
[04:56] <funkyHat> Vaske_Car, :w
[04:56] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: :w   but you should read  :help
[04:56] <n30n> funkyHat: eth1 status: disconnected
[04:57] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: or at least run 'vimtutor'
[04:57] <Varanger> I have modified heavily the partition table, how can I update the /etc/fstab automatically ???
[04:57] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, do I click Alt_W?
[04:57] <funkyHat> n30n, ok, if you click the arrow next to it a couple of times, can you make it say 'this network interface is not configured'?
[04:57] <funkyHat> n30n, or open it up and remove the settings so it says that...
[04:57] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: I don't understand what you mean
[04:57] <n30n> funkyHat: It already is.
[04:57] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, if I click "w" it just type "w"

[04:58] <n30n> funkyHat: I got the wireless card status thingy in the top tray, but when i double click it it tells me its disconnected
[04:58] <funkyHat> n30n, ah ok, now... can you see an networking icon near the clock in the top left?
[04:59] <funkyHat> n30n, ok... what if you single click on it? or right click ?

[04:59] <derekS> I want to mount my pocketpc phone as a storage device. lsusb recognizes that it is attached, but i don't know hwere to go from here
[04:59] <derekS> any suggestions
[04:59] <n30n> funkyHat: single click made properties come up and right click gave me a drop menu with "Properties, about, help, remove from trey"
[05:00] <Em3rald> Anyone know why the program Keytouch might not be working *quite* right?  I have selected the correct keyboard, and it WAS all working peachy keen a few weeks ago.  But now some of the media keys don't do anything, some of them open the wrong thing, and some of them are like mouse-clicks and aren't very helpful anymore.  Thoughts?
[05:00] <kranky> !alsa
[05:00] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[05:00] <n30n> funkyHat: Properties: eth1
[05:00] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, I do not understand how to click : and W at the same time
[05:01] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: not at the same time, one followed by the next
[05:01] <funkyHat> n30n, ok I'm not sure if that's the right network icon -.- hmmm... have you installed network-manager-gnome?
[05:01] <Vaske_Car_> now how to exit by q?
[05:01] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: :q
[05:01] <Vaske_Car_> ok
[05:01] <niru> funkyHat:Do you have any idea on zenity
[05:01] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: you can use :wq  too to save and exit
[05:02] <n30n> funkyHat: Yeah that one only shows me a drop menu with "wired network"
[05:02] <Vaske_Car_> now I know, I use ECS to enter command mode for VI  :)
[05:02] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: yes
[05:02] <Vaske_Car_> thanks
[05:02] <PORDO> tonyyarusso the governance page unfortunately does not tell what voting method is used, and implies that voting is only used when a consensus cannot be reached.
[05:03] <PORDO> i say they just use range voting, and vote on all the issues.  it will allow them to find their real consensus, better than just casually guessing.
[05:03] <funkyHat> niru, none at all actually, didn't know it existed until just now ;)
[05:03] <ToHellWithGA> hullo hullo.  i need to rebuild GRUB's options b/c it picks the wrong partition and the wrong image.  how can i do that so i don't have to manually edit GRUB entries at each startup?
[05:04] <AzMoo> Hey. How can I set up 5.1 surround for my audigy?
[05:04] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, if I want to update only installed aplications I use "apt-get update" ?
[05:04] <fatalcure> ToHellWithGA: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[05:04] <ToHellWithGA> thanks fatalcure
[05:04] <funkyHat> n30n, ah... :( um.. looks like it might not support your card perhaps... I thought I read that it did support ndiswrapper though..
[05:04] <tonyyarusso> PORDO: Okay
[05:04] <econobeing> hey guys, when i use wine and utorrent, i can't see the utorrent window
[05:04] <Em3rald> Sorry to be a pest and repeat myself, but ... Anyone know why the program Keytouch might not be working *quite* right?  I have selected the correct keyboard, and it WAS all working peachy keen a few weeks ago.  But now some of the media keys don't do anything, some of them open the wrong thing, and some of them are like mouse-clicks and aren't very helpful anymore.  Thoughts?
[05:04] <race> whos good with wine
[05:05] <n30n> funkyHat: Maybe i didn't configure ndiswrapper right. Wasn't it suppose to create a wlan0 alais?
[05:05] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: apt-get update updates the package list, apt-get upgrade  upgrades packages to the latest version in the repositories
[05:05] <dirle> finaly got to the page I need
[05:05] <econobeing> i used to be able to see it

[05:05] <dirle> http://www.commonmancomputing.com/y/Learn/DualBootVistaandLinux/tabid/62/Default.aspx .. for u guys to have if others like me bothers u about dual booting vista.. lol
[05:05] <econobeing> when i use photoshop 7, i can still see those windows
[05:05] <econobeing> but for some reason utorrent wont come up
[05:06] <tim167> question about Open Source /Free Software : if a commercial company uses open source code in proprietary software, they don't have to show the source code, so noone can tell if ther'se gpl-ed code inside, right ?
[05:06] <funkyHat> n30n, there's particular need for a wireless card to be called wlan? rather than eth? mine is eth1... maybe something else in ndiswrapper config though
[05:06] <Em3rald> tim167:  that's a good question for #ubuntu-offtopic
[05:06] <linlin> is there any way to reload ubuntu without sticking in a CD and reloading it?  my laptop does not have cdrom drive but i have a half-working copy of ubuntu on it
[05:07] <chalcedony> hugs
[05:07] <n30n> funkyHat: The instructions told me to iwconfig wlan0 scan after i installed the ndiswrapper driver, but it says thers no wlan0 device
[05:08] <n30n> funkyHat: Supposivly ndiswrapper -m made an alais
[05:08] <yoshig3> Anyone experiencing slow drawing in ubuntu?
[05:08] <Em3rald> linlin:  have you tried sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop perhaps?
[05:08] <chalcedony> since we upgraded my box to edgy it's been SERIOUSLY SLOW to change applications. I can wait MINUTES to be able to typein a different screen or get a menu.. is this normal?
[05:08] <funkyHat> n30n, your wireless card is called eth1, so if something tells you to use wlan0 put eth1 instead
[05:08] <n30n> chalcedony: are you duel boot. how much diskspace do you have left
[05:09] <n30n> funkyHat: Yeah i tried that with very little luck
[05:09] <godlygeek> does anyone have any suggestions for what to do about unreadable console windows after a suspend to ram? (xorg resumes just fine! )
[05:09] <yoshig3> funkyHat: Any ideas yet?
[05:09] <stephan21> n30n: i am duel ....does it matter?
[05:09] <LookTJ> edgy has too many bugs
[05:09] <kitche> chalcedony: see what video driver your using in xorg.conf also
[05:09] <LookTJ> dapper is most stable
[05:09] <n30n> stephan21: It can make the performance lag
[05:10] <chalcedony> n30n: i'm not dual boot and it should have plenty of hd .. not sure if it's a swap problem maybe?
[05:10] <ski-worklap> LookTJ, you think so?
[05:10] <ski-worklap> edgy is a "stable" release, is it not?
[05:10] <yoshig3> HAY!
[05:10] <yoshig3> How can I make sure I'm using the nvidia binary driver??
[05:10] <n30n> chalcedony: i don't mess with swap partitions ask somebody better than me
[05:10] <yoshig3> I'm using the newest nvidia drivers atm
[05:10] <godlygeek> ski-worklap: don't let anyone convince you of that.
[05:10] <funkyHat> yoshig3, no I can't think of anything at all sorry... unless you haven't enabled the nvidia binary driver... hmm
[05:10] <violot> Is a apt-get dist-upgrade basically upgrading to the next version of Ubuntu?  (I'm new to Ubuntu, but not new to Linux)
[05:10] <funkyHat> yoshig3, lsmod |grep nvidia
[05:10] <econobeing> arrggh, i can't see the utorrent window
[05:10] <violot> I'm used to d/l'ing the new cd's, and reinstalling ;)
[05:11] <kitche> ski-worklap: it works if you do a fresh isntall but when you upgrade you always should think that there will be breakage
[05:11] <n30n> funkyHat: root@lappy486:~# iwlist eth1 scan
[05:11] <n30n> eth1      Interface doesn't support scanning : No such device
[05:11] <econobeing> it was working fine, now all of the sudden the window doesn't pop up no matter what i do, what gives
[05:11] <ski-worklap> kitche, right
[05:11] <jrib> violot: man apt-get, explains the differences
[05:11] <yoshig3> funkyHat: nvidia               4714676  22

[05:11] <ski-worklap> godless, don't let anyone convince me of what?
[05:11] <yoshig3> funkyHat: Does that mean it's enabled?
[05:11] <kitche> violot: sudo update-manager -c is how you hsould upgrade
[05:11] <violot> Okee, thanks
[05:12] <funkyHat> yoshig3, looks like it's not... I should have got you to do something different though... lol
[05:12] <w30> ubotu, upgrade
[05:12] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:12] <violot> Do I have to manually edit my /etc/apt/sources.list file, or is it done for me?
[05:12] <yoshig3> funkyHat: How do I enable it?
[05:12] <godlygeek> ski-worklap: an edgy upgrade is awful.  had no problem with warty->breezy->dapper, but dapper->edgy just flat out didn't work well.
[05:12] <funkyHat> yoshig3, sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[05:12] <violot> :|
[05:12] <ski-worklap> godlygeek, did you try a fresh install?
[05:12] <violot> Is it a good idea to upgrade to edgy or breezy?
[05:12] <n30n> funkyHat: Something has to be configured wrong
[05:12] <jrib> violot: what version are you using now?
[05:13] <violot> Dapper
[05:13] <yoshig3> funkyHat: Error: your X configuration has been altered.
[05:13] <yoshig3> This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
[05:13] <yoshig3> not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
[05:13] <yoshig3> command:
[05:13] <yoshig3> md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum
[05:13] <yoshig3> otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section
[05:13] <ski-worklap> my fresh install of edgy has about teh same number of problems as my fresh install of dapper
[05:13] <yoshig3> from nv to nvidia.
[05:13] <yoshig3> funkyHat: what does that mean?
[05:13] <kitche> !paste|yoshig3
[05:13] <ubotu> yoshig3: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:13] <n30n> funkyHat: I can get this laptop to go wireless using whoppix
[05:13] <engla> violot: not if you don't have a need or a lust for exploration
[05:13] <yoshig3> kitche: no duh, but I don't wanna pastebin 350 times
[05:13] <ski-worklap> and that's almost exclusively linux kernel weirdness (hibernate/suspend dont work on this laptop)
[05:13] <violot> Well, I'm a geek, that's why I'm upgrading ;)
[05:13] <godlygeek> ski-worklap: I'm still trying to work through it all, but if i reinstall i'm going back to dapper.
[05:13] <robdeman> hey all is there any good Apache config manager? eg I want to make Apache use /home/rob/httpdocs/ as the generic starting point for Apache's includs httpdcos etc
[05:13] <funkyHat> violot, if you're happy with breezy, it's still supported at the moment, but dapper is very nice and will be supported for a long time, so I would recommend you upgrade :)
[05:13] <chalcedony> n30n: ty much :)
[05:13] <engla> violot: in that case, go ahead, upgrade to edgy
[05:13] <ski-worklap> kitche, you can paste more than one file in pastebin
[05:14] <balder> hi  people  I just asking about some  *.wmv  player  please tell me any one
[05:14] <kitche> ski-worklap: ?
[05:14] <violot> Errr, I mean upgrade to Edgy, not dapper, sorry
[05:14] <tonyyarusso> robdeman: Yep, /etc/apache2/
[05:14] <jrib> violot: breezy came before dapper, so your only option is to go to edgy if you want to upgrade :)
[05:14] <kitche> balder: install w32codecs
[05:14] <LookTJ> ski-worklap: yeah, btw, did they ever fix the screensaver bug on edgy?
[05:14] <violot> Yeah, wrong code name, sorry :P
[05:14] <robdeman> tonyyarusso: is that a tool?
[05:14] <ski-worklap> LookTJ, what screensaver bug?
[05:14] <ski-worklap> i changed my laptop to just blank my screen
[05:15] <ski-worklap> there might very well have been some problem that i never noticed
[05:15] <engla> violot: it might actually do just that. You have been warned
[05:15] <balder> Kitche   thanks ,   so any spetial codecs?
[05:15] <engla> violot: so take backups
[05:15] <Jac1> How to use ubuntu with windowsXP?
[05:15] <Journeyman> I installed vncserver, when I connect all I see is the gnome start up screen (where it loads the desktop0
[05:15] <Journeyman> and it just sits there and does nothing
[05:15] <violot> I have most of what I need back-upped
[05:15] <Journeyman> how do I set it to choose a certain desktop
[05:15] <kitche> balder: just install the w32codecs and it will install the windows codecs that you want
[05:15] <Journeyman> or not to load gnome
[05:15] <LookTJ> ski-worklap: the one bug where i get blank screensaver nothing showing, i change it, still nothing shows, blank screen
[05:16] <tonyyarusso> robdeman: Nope - directory of config files.  They're not too hard to understand really
[05:16] <kitche> violot: see your smart you backup stuff when you upgrade :)
[05:16] <balder> Kitche    thanks  a Lot
[05:16] <violot> I backup because I got in the habit back when I used Windows :P
[05:17] <ski-worklap> LookTJ, are you sayinga normal screensaver shows as blank, or that you can't leave a blank screensaver?
[05:17] <n30n> funkyHat: should i give up on wireless?
[05:17] <violot> *VERY HARDLY*
[05:17] <Music_Shuffle> lol
[05:18] <LookTJ> ski-worklap: the default screensaver(random) doesn't show up in edgy like it usually does in dapper
[05:18] <funkyHat> n30n, certainly not if you can get it to run using a different distro... post a request on the forums (in my experience you're more likely to sort out an issue on the forums than on here)
[05:18] <ski-worklap> LookTJ, i see. well a random screensaver is a bad idea for a default anyway if you ask me.
[05:18] <ski-worklap> blank or something else low-cpu sohuld be default
[05:18] <violot> I'd love to have my Dad's USB external drive to keep my home directory on in case of a crash..
[05:18] <violot> That'd be nice
[05:19] <Jac1> :'(
[05:19] <Music_Shuffle> My home is like 40 gigs. =/
[05:19] <ski-worklap> violot, there are many ways to keep proper backups
[05:19] <LookTJ> ski-worklap: i also changed it, but still black screen
[05:19] <kranky> Anyone with an Audigy 1 card ever lose ALSA playback and get it back?
[05:19] <violot> Well, wish me luck.  Here I go.  :)
[05:19] <Shadowpillar> ;D
[05:19] <ski-worklap> LookTJ, interesting
[05:19] <Music_Shuffle> Err...85 gigs.*
[05:19] <Shadowpillar> er
[05:19] <Shadowpillar> 2GB
[05:19] <robdeman> everytime I do gnome-ession it reports tons of errors on the soundcard - my server doesnt have one - how do I disable those errors?
[05:20] <LookTJ> ski-worklap: it happens when i lock the screen on edgy
[05:20] <Jac1> :'(
[05:20] <n30n> funkyHat: Whoppix is the only distro that i have gotten to do it.
[05:20] <Jac1> :'(
[05:20] <Jac1> :'(
[05:20] <violot> If I'm not back, I got screwd over
[05:20] <Jac1> :'(

[05:20] <Jac1> :'(
[05:20] <violot> screwd = screwed
[05:20] <ski-worklap> LookTJ, oh, that bug is still there

[05:20] <n30n> Jacl: what?
[05:21] <funkyHat> n30n, you could try to copy out everything related to the wireless drivers from whoppix... and put them in your ubuntu installation (I wouldn't know what you'd need to copy though... I've never had to use ndiswrapper)
[05:21] <Music_Shuffle> And Hobbsee. :D

[05:25] <Jac1> :'(
[05:25] <w30> linlin, I think you want to make a loopback mount and make it appear to be a regular file system.

[05:25] <Music_Shuffle> Oh, I've not tried under Edgy.

[05:25] <yoshig3> kitche: okay it backed up. what now?
[05:25] <whyameye> robdeman: you might be looking for "sudo /etc/init.d/<service> stop"
[05:25] <Music_Shuffle> Jac1, what do you mean?
[05:25] <robdeman> im logged on as root
[05:25] <Music_Shuffle> How to install it, or dual-boot it or what?
[05:25] <kitche> yoshig3: now check your xorg.conf see if it has nvidia as the driver
[05:25] <tim167> Jac1: ubuntu is an operating system, you use it INSTEAD of win XP
[05:25] <yoshig3> kitche: it does
[05:25] <Jac1> i mean two OS in one pc
[05:25] <funkyHat> n30n, ubuntu has a vnc client installed by default ;)
[05:26] <robdeman> qhy do I need to sudo when I am root?
[05:26] <kitche> yoshig3: ok restart X
[05:26] <Music_Shuffle> econobeing, I would just reinstall wine, and see if you can't be sure to clear out all the configs, then reinstall, and yous hould be anew...>.>

=== mhu is now known as _mhu
[05:26] <linlin> any ideas as to how to install ubuntu from a usb drive?
[05:27] <yoshig3> kitche: that obviously isn't doing anything. It won't let me start the drivers
[05:27] <whyameye> francois: you mean with another command or with an editor or what?
[05:27] <n30n> funkyHat: Yeah.  could you connect to me and see if you can't shed light on my wireless prob
[05:27] <xipietotec> okay: I type: wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/1609B551.gpg --quiet -O- | sudo apt-key add - and get an "Ok" return, but then when I do apt-get/aptitude update it tells me there's no valid pgp key?
[05:27] <Arastoo> can any body tell me plz how to improve my screen resoulution , its not working from system->administrative-> screen resoulution
[05:27] <kitche> yoshig3: ah you having that API problem still?
[05:27] <yoshig3> kitche: no
[05:27] <funkyHat> n30n, I doubt I'll  be able to help but I'll give it a go if you want
[05:27] <francois> whyameye, using command line, i want to be able to search a string and replace it with something else in a file
[05:27] <yoshig3> kitche: just can't enable the drivers. Composite isn't enabled either htough. Here's my xorg.conf http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36563/
[05:27] <jrib> !fixres | Arastoo
[05:27] <ubotu> Arastoo: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[05:28] <kitche> yoshig3: paste your xorg.0.log it's in /var/log
[05:28] <jrib> francois: use sed
[05:28] <xipietotec> In fact, this is what I get back from aptitude: W: GPG error: http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org edgy Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 3FF0DB166A7476EA
[05:28] <francois> jrib, i tried, but it just keeps saying it doesn't reconise the characters... ??
[05:28] <jrib> xipietotec: that's because the server is getting hammered
[05:28] <xipietotec> oh
[05:28] <jrib> francois: paste the command
[05:28] <Arastoo> i changed my crt to lcd and resoulution just changed
[05:29] <xipietotec> so my apt-key is okay?
[05:29] <jrib> xipietotec: it worked anyway for me, I just trusted the unsigned packages
[05:29] <Arastoo> its gone every thing gone
[05:29] <Arastoo> its black now what should i do
[05:29] <xipietotec> jrib: I like my signed packaged
[05:29] <xipietotec> packages
[05:29] <francois> jrib, sudo sed -e s/\sdapper/ edgy/g -i /etc/ap
[05:29] <jrib> francois: then keep trying :)
[05:29] <mardi_soir> hello .. if i make a deb package without  specific options will it run  "everywhere" ?
[05:29] <jrib> xipietotec: the keep trying :)
[05:29] <yoshig3> kitche: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36574/
[05:29] <econobeing> hmmm, the "rm -Rf ~/.wine ; winecfg" worked <_>
[05:30] <jrib> francois: what kind of quotes are those?  use ''
[05:30] <kitche> yoshig3: according to your log you have the nvidia drivers working
[05:30] <yoshig3> kitche: what's the enable command?
[05:31] <yoshig3> kitche: because graphically my ubuntu is running very slow
[05:31] <francois> jrib, excellent, thanks man, you saved like 15min of work
[05:31] <kitche> yoshig3: when you did nvidia-xconfig it's pretty much the same as nvidia-glx-config enable
[05:31] <jrib> francois: heh np
[05:31] <yoshig3> kitche: nvidia-xconfig just backed up my xorg
[05:32] <kitche> yoshig3: no it didn't it also changed your xorg.conf so that your drivers are nvidia
[05:32] <kitche> yoshig3: it changes your xorg.conf and makes a backup before it does the changes
[05:33] <funkyHat> yoshig3, ::
[05:34] <Z> ???
[05:34] <funkyHat> sup Z?
[05:35] <Z> some problem about dualboot
[05:35] <ademan> is airodump anywhere in the repositories?
[05:35] <levander> ademan: "apt-cache search airodump"
[05:36] <ademan> levander: there's no package named airodump
[05:36] <ademan> and i used synaptic to check descriptions as well
[05:36] <levander> ademan: "apt-cache search air"
[05:36] <ademan> nothing
[05:36] <levander> ademan: probably not...
[05:36] <ademan> it's supposed to be part of the aircrack suite
[05:36] <ademan> and i've got the aircrack package...
[05:37] <Vaske_Car_> I can not install mozilla_mplayer  there is a problem with server... anybody have solution?
[05:37] <levander> ademan: are your sure airodump is not included in the aircrack suite
[05:37] <levander> ?
[05:37] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: pastebin the output from 'sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer'
[05:37] <Z> ???
[05:38] <ademan> levander: well i may have the answer, i had uninstalled the aircrack package, but kept the aircrack-ng package, it's possible that the aircrack package contains it
[05:38] <ademan> levander: yep, that was it
[05:38] <ademan> :-/
[05:38] <danl> how would you search all the files in the current directory and all directories below that one for a string in the file?
[05:38] <ademan> aircrack-ng was apparently ONLY a new version of the aircrack utility, not the whole suite
[05:38] <jrib> danl: grep -R
[05:39] <levander> ademan: i imagine aircrack then should be dependent upon aircrack-ng?  so there aren't two packages containing the aircrack utility?
[05:39] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36576/
[05:40] <gotit> can anybody plz tell me how to improve my screen resoulution, i just changed to lcd from crt
[05:40] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list please
[05:40] <SurfnKid> does anyone know the difference between atom and rss feeds?
[05:40] <jrib> gotit: does system > preferences > screen resolution not list what you want?
[05:40] <levander> gotit: got to reconfigure x-windows for a new monitor probably
[05:41] <gotit> jrib: no
[05:41] <levander> gotit: "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[05:41] <jrib> !fixres | gotit

[05:41] <graham_100> do i need to change any settings on my wireless card when i change my isp???
[05:41] <gotit> levander: how
[05:41] <levander> gotit: "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[05:41] <robdeman> where does apache by default store its ssl https stuff?
[05:41] <Z> ???
[05:41] <graham_100> can you use telnet to search for local networks??
[05:41] <gotit> jrib: i did that and the monitor goes black
[05:41] <ademan> levander: it actually didn't, i think aircrack-ng only contained an updated version of the aircrack util
[05:41] <jrib> gotit: what is "that"?
[05:41] <levander> ademan: ah, i see
[05:42] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36577/
[05:42] <graham_100> levander : hello there again
[05:42] <ademan> levander: pretty crappy way to do business, but meh
[05:42] <levander> graham_100: hi graham_100, how's it going?
[05:42] <karthik> guys help me....tell me a good software which help to read CHM files
[05:42] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: remove the unofficial stuff you have
[05:42] <graham_100> levander : all fine at the moment still have trouble with sourcing wine 3d drivers
[05:42] <graham_100> lol
[05:42] <levander> ademan: yeah, does sound a little messy, guy who did aircrack-ng should have upgraded the whole package probably
[05:42] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: ie http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org
[05:42] <karthik> guys help me....tell me a good software which help to read CHM files
[05:43] <levander> graham_100: i'm hopeless there, i don't mess with 3d
[05:43] <kitche> !chm
[05:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about chm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:43] <levander> karthik: what's a CHK file?
[05:43] <kitche> karthik: you mean the windows files?
[05:43] <jrib> kitche: xchm
[05:43] <graham_100> levander : do you know anything about telnet??? and changing isp??
[05:43] <levander> graham_100: you want to change your IP?
[05:43] <karthik> chm r like PDF
[05:43] <levander> ISP*
[05:43] <gotit> jrib: what ubotu told me
[05:43] <karthik> to read documents
[05:43] <jrib> karthik: install xchm
[05:44] <karthik> ok jrib
[05:44] <jrib> gotit: that page lists several methods iirc, what exactly did you try?
[05:44] <gotit> levander: it is asking me to select a video card driver for the x server
[05:44] <graham_100> levander : no no , i am changing my service provider (resulting in loss of connection between 14/12 and new years) :(
[05:44] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, installed :) but what is the point, it tried to download from unofficial respositors, why not from default ones?
[05:44] <gotit> jrib: the command in ubotu sentence
[05:44] <tomlins> anyone know why when i run the short cut I created to run eclipse (/usr/bin/eclipse) it cant find my default jre, yet if I cd to /usr/bin and run eclipse it works fine ??
[05:44] <levander> graham_100: okay, i hope you like the new ISP better...
[05:45] <graham_100> levander i will still be using the same router so wil i need to change any card settings??
[05:45] <levander> graham_100: you might need to change how your router (via a web page the router itself serves) logs into your ISP.
[05:45] <jrib> gotit: I meant for you to read the wiki page
[05:45] <somerville32> graham_100: What kind of connection do you have? ADSL, Cable, Dial up?
[05:45] <levander> graham_100: cable internet providers in the USA - don't think you have to, DSL providers - you would
[05:46] <gotit> jrib: ok but the command was so i applied it
[05:46] <graham_100> levander i have adsl and can i run the changes without an adsl conection being live on my line??
[05:46] <karthik> thanks guys
[05:46] <graham_100> levander i think it will cause me a headache lol
[05:46] <levander> graham_100: yeah, you can probably reconfigure the router, but it won't be able to connect it sounds like
[05:47] <somerville32> graham_100: IT depends on the ISP. You'll have to change your username and passwd of course.
[05:47] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, it still does not play this video: http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~dga/pool/normal_videos/NV2-1.htm
[05:47] <_tcc> Where can I set the WM for X?
[05:47] <_tcc> I want to use XDM, and drop into fluxbox.
[05:47] <levander> graham_100: if you have a username and password for your ISP that is
[05:47] <gotit> why its asking me to select a video card driver , i just changed the screen
[05:47] <jrib> gotit: some advice, don't execute any commands if you don't know what they do exactly.  Feel free to ask, but ubotu does say "to restart X, ..." and later says "To fix screen resolution, ...".  Still I understand the confusion.  The best method on that page is what you are doing now with dpkg-reconfigure
[05:47] <kitche> _tcc xwmconfig
[05:47] <graham_100> levandr the isp i am with now i never need to put in any log in details it's on all the time
[05:47] <levander> gotit: it's not that fine grained, you have to reconfigure everything
[05:48] <graham_100> levander the new isp requires a log in
[05:48] <levander> graham_100: some ISP's are like that
[05:48] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: what codec does the video use?
[05:48] <levander> graham_100: well, for the new isp, but in a new login/password then
[05:48] <Vaske_Car_> windows media
[05:48] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: have you installed w32codecs?
[05:48] <graham_100> levander i shouldn't have to do anything at the p.c side though right?
[05:48] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, windows media, i hope so
[05:48] <levander> graham_100: correct
[05:48] <Vaske_Car_> not sure
[05:48] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, not sure
[05:48] <jrib> ubotu: tell Vaske_Car_ about w32codecs
[05:49] <levander> graham_100: only if you make other changes to the router that effect the PC, but you probably won't
[05:49] <joeshmo> so i have my other 2 hard drives now as ext3. they are mounted but it says i dont have the permissions to write to them
[05:49] <graham_100> levander i have a neighbour on wireless also and the git keeps on connecting to my router as i only have a wep key at the moment! can i use telnet to find his network and give some payback??? lol
[05:49] <_tcc> kitche, what exactly is that changing?
[05:49] <_tcc> I am remastering Ubuntu.
[05:49] <levander> joeshmo: what are the options for the other two hard drives in /etc/fstab?  or, did you mount them from the command line
[05:49] <_tcc> With reconstructor.
[05:49] <levander> ?
[05:49] <jrib> joeshmo: change their permissions using chmod and/or chown
[05:49] <jrib> ubotu: tell joeshmo about permissions
[05:50] <joeshmo> i used pysdm
[05:50] <kitche> -tcc: allows you to pick a window manager tat you want to use
[05:50] <gotit> levander: i dont know what card i am using
[05:50] <levander> graham_100: it's probably easier just to connect your wireless card to his network to find it
[05:50] <gotit> levander: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 900
[05:50] <joeshmo> it still thinks they are ntfs in fstab i think
[05:50] <gotit> it says on the hp page
[05:51] <levander> gotit: what is a hp page?
[05:51] <gotit> levander: and its not listed in confguing xserver
[05:51] <levander> gotit: did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg not detect your video card?
[05:51] <gotit> thats hewlet packard page
[05:51] <graham_100> levander my card picks it's network up and connects to it but i cant get web access through it as i don't know the wep key their side
[05:51] <monoxide> sup everyone, I need to know what command to use to install gkismet from my desktop. if anyone could help me it would be nice
[05:51] <exhav0k> hey, something happened and my ipod no longer boots with write capabilities
[05:51] <Epidemik> how do i find my internal ip?
[05:51] <gotit> no its asking me to select a video card
[05:51] <Epidemik> !ip
[05:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ip - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:52] <_tcc> kitche, where can i get it?
[05:52] <graham_100> levander and he is causing me some real bad upstream problems so i have no idea what he is downloading and sending through my router
[05:52] <kitche> Epidemik: ifconfig
[05:52] <levander> gotit: first check to see if "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" detects your graphics card
[05:52] <Epidemik> kitche thnx
[05:52] <levander> gotit: but, if explicitly asked, i'd trust the hp page
[05:52] <gotit> ok
[05:52] <_tcc> What scripts should I modify exactly?
[05:52] <levander> graham_100: why don't you secure your router with a wep key?
[05:53] <_tcc> I want XDM to go into Fluxbox.
[05:53] <kitche> _tcc: hmm it seems like ubuntu doesn't have it
[05:54] <robert11> Hi all
[05:55] <robert11> this is not directly realted to ubuntu...
[05:55] <robert11> related even
[05:55] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, installed w32codecs and still wont play http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~dga/pool/normal_videos/NV2-1.htm
[05:55] <gotit> levander : its says ," it is necessary to select a video card driver for the x server" there is a list but mine is not listed
[05:55] <Vermyndax> evenin
[05:55] <graham_100> levander i have a wep key active at the moment but i am thinking about changing to wpa  key instead
[05:56] <Vermyndax> can anyone tell me how linux uses memory... buffers/cache and calculates free RAM?
[05:56] <levander> gotit: is it just a list of drivers, or a list of video cards?
[05:56] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: pastebin the page that you get when you go to 'about:plugins' in your address bar
[05:56] <graham_100> levander i am told that is more secure
[05:56] <levander> graham_100: did he break your WEP key??
[05:56] <graham_100> levander i do believe so yes
[05:56] <gotit> levander : i think its a list of video cards
[05:56] <levander> gotit: type out one of the items on the list
[05:57] <levander> graham_100: can you explicitly blacklist his PC on your router?
[05:57] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, http://pastebin.ca/276295
[05:57] <gotit> voodoo
[05:57] <yoshig3> Well, it's still laggy
[05:57] <yoshig3> It started up, but still laggy.....wtf.
[05:57] <levander> gotit: that sounds like an X graphics card driver to me, not the name of a graphics card
[05:57] <graham_100> levander also he has had access to my router and i can't find his ip, every time i go into the router the intrusion list has been cleared lol
[05:57] <carutsu> I'm back, guys, now i'mon my ubuntu
[05:57] <levander> gotit: you have to figure out which driver is for you graphics card
[05:57] <funkyHat> graham_100, just change to wpa, wep is all but useless, enabling MAC filtering couldn't hurt either
[05:58] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: close all instances of firefox, 'sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer*', start firefox, try again
[05:58] <yoshig3> It's not AS laggy now though
[05:58] <to2> hi all
[05:58] <levander> gotit: it was probably the driver that was first selected when that screen came up
[05:58] <gotit> levander: how do i figure it out
[05:58] <yoshig3> funkyHat: seriously man...wow. It's not as laggy now but it's still laggy
[05:58] <graham_100> funkyhat do i need to reconfigure my card going to wpa?
[05:58] <yoshig3> funkyHat: should I pay ubuntu to fix my problem?
[05:58] <levander> gotit: what was selected when it first came up?
=== c0 is now known as Co_FitnesSby
[05:58] <bradley> i cannot install themes properly. i download a theme from gnome-art drag it to the theme app and it says that it installs but the controls do not work. how do i fix this?
[05:59] <gotit> levander: i dunno lemme do it again
[05:59] <zebrinha> hi
[05:59] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, you the expert!
[05:59] <niru> zebrinha:hello
[05:59] <joeshmo> i could do this easy if i could run x as root
[05:59] <joeshmo> change the permissions that is
[05:59] <zebrinha> were are you from
[05:59] <joeshmo> i dont know how to use chmod
[05:59] <yoshig3> well HOLY crap
[05:59] <graham_100> can i use telnet to search for the local wireless networks around the area of my house to see if i can obtain his ip to block him from my router??
[05:59] <jrib> Vaske_Car_: firefox was still using totem.  You could have also just removed totem
[05:59] <yoshig3> beryl loaded
[05:59] <yoshig3> BUT
[05:59] <jengc0il> hi ppl
[06:00] <yoshig3> I HAS NO BORDERS!
[06:00] <to2> I'm trying to install e177 following the  http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/enlightenment_depots method,but when I try the apt-get install, it says that no version is avaylable, what have I done wrong ?
[06:00] <bradley> when i said that the controls do not work i mean that they don't install, the slider or buttons just turn into blocks
[06:00] <funkyHat> yoshig3, I didn't realise you had a problem with performance... :-S
[06:00] <jrib> yoshig3: pastebin your xorg.conf
[06:00] <yoshig3> I have already millions of times...but beryl started up this time
[06:00] <yoshig3> BUT
[06:00] <yoshig3> I have no borders.
[06:00] <jrib> !enter | yoshig3
[06:00] <ubotu> yoshig3: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[06:00] <ThePub> beryl is kind've nifty.. too bad it doesn't manage windows as well as metacity
[06:01] <bradley> yoshig3, alt f2 then type 'emerald --replace'
[06:01] <yoshig3> and I can't switch to firefox T.T
[06:01] <jrib> yoshig3: I fixed the same issue with borders yesterday
[06:01] <gotit> levander now its saying config.dat is locked by another process
[06:01] <levander> gotit: "sudo rm config.dat"
[06:01] <levander> gotit: wait
[06:01] <gotit> ok
[06:01] <levander> gotit: how did you get out of dpkg-reconfigure last time?
[06:02] <yoshig3> jrib: how?
[06:02] <jrib> yoshig3: I need to see your xorg.conf
[06:02] <levander> gotit: did you hit Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z?
[06:02] <niru> zebrinha:use my nick and type otherwise I am unable to locate your message
[06:02] <yoshig3> emerald replace just reloads beryl lol

[06:02] <Music_Shuffle> !caps | niru
[06:02] <ubotu> niru: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[06:02] <funkyHat> yoshig3, click on the ruby and switch your display manager back to metacity for now so that jrib can help you
[06:02] <gotit> levander: is it the command to apply
[06:02] <levander> graham_100: i have no idea how to search for an ip address in telnet
[06:03] <yoshig3> wow beryl is pretty
[06:03] <levander> graham_100: i almost think what you want is called a sniffer, but i've never used one
[06:03] <s3phir3> ironic how ubotu uses caps to say that.
[06:03] <funkyHat> Unless it works anyway... lol
[06:03] <yoshig3> funkyHat: there is no ruby....
[06:03] <graham_100> levander ok
[06:03] <levander> gotit: it's the command to see if you are still running dpkg-reconfigure

[06:03] <funkyHat> yoshig3, never mind, sounds like you've got beryl to work anyway :)
[06:03] <levander> gotit: you have to release the lock on config.dat held by the old dpkg-reconfigure process
[06:03] <yoshig3> jrib: getting my xorg.conf
[06:04] <gotit> ok and what does sudo rm config.dat means
[06:04] <Vaske_Car_> jrib, never mind its working now
[06:04] <levander> gotit: don't do that

[06:17] <niru> zebrinha:going to become python if I learn in full fledge even I liked Gtk
[06:17] <brenden> LaTeX is usually pronounced [le.tk]  or [l.tk]  in English (that is, not with the [ks]  pronunciation English speakers normally associate with X, but with a voiceless velar plosive like the first sound of "kit"). The last character in the name comes from a capital  (chi), as the name of TeX derives from the Greek  (skill, art, technique); for this reason, TeX's creator Donald Knuth promotes a /tx/

[06:19] <CharlieSu> anyone want to help try my denyhosts install?  make a few bad pass attempts on charlie.phunki.com please...
[06:19] <yoshig3> also, is there a way to make the system monitor show overall cpu usage? not just from individual tasks
[06:19] <jrib> yoshig3: what kind of card do you have?
[06:19] <levander> yoshig3: what processor, graphics card, and memory you got?
[06:19] <Karark|away> any idea why xorg takes 100% CPU randomly?
[06:19] <gotit> levander :http://pastebin.ca/276313
[06:19] <levander> yoshig3: got to the performance tab to see that
[06:20] <levander> Karark|away: because you need to restart X
[06:20] <yoshig3> jrib: 2.4Ghz Celeron(poopy), 512MB DDR ram, and a GeForce4 MX 4000 128MB DDR
[06:20] <yoshig3> PCI >.<
[06:20] <Karark|away> levander, i shouldn't need to multiple times a day
[06:20] <jerp> isn't there a tweak for graphic cards memory?
[06:20] <levander> Karark|away: it comes back after you restart it?
[06:21] <Karark|away> levander, yes, it's done this about 10 times now, it seems random
=== ChrisBradley is now known as Formula1
[06:21] <jrib> yoshig3: idk, since I have a crappier card.  You could try asking in #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl to see if people with similar cards also have the same experience
[06:21] <yoshig3> jrib: well do you run slow?
[06:21] <RonanCeol> I need some help, running Ubuntu on cd for the first time and after about 2 minutes my mouse cuts out
[06:21] <jrib> yoshig3: yes
[06:21] <yoshig3> jrib: hmm
[06:22] <levander> Karark|away: i think there's some way to use apt-get or dpkg to verify the files are right for a package on the system, may also try reconfiguring xserver-xorg with the dpkg-reconfigure command
[06:22] <jrib> yoshig3: I expected to though, it's a 4yr old laptop
[06:22] <Arastoo> sorry did any thing happened i was disc

[06:23] <parad0x> I just had to do exactly what levander describes, it works.
[06:23] <levander> Arastoo: well, apparently you configured X wrong, try reconfiguring it

[06:30] <TheGilmanator> Yeah, the latest beryl. I've got a funky thing happening I was wondering if anyone else saw.
[06:30] <RonanCeol> Ya I did, like I said when I restarted it worked fine, tried all my usb ports too
[06:30] <sc4ttrbrain> i m running it now :D
[06:30] <jrib> TheGilmanator: try #ubuntu-xgl

[06:30] <jrib> monoxide: yes, see the link from ubotu I sent you
[06:30] <ubox> monoxide: yup

[06:31] <sc4ttrbrain> TheGilmanator: what funky thing?
[06:31] <jrib> monoxide: the one after
[06:31] <monoxide> that was the olny link I had seen

[06:31] <Formula1> It happens a lot less often for me in Linux than windows if that's any consolation.
[06:31] <jrib> monoxide: actually not to confuse you, I sent you info about compiling gkismet because it isn't packaged for ubuntu.  But usually you use synaptic that ubox told you about
[06:32] <jrib> !compiling > monoxide
[06:32] <jrib> !synaptic > monoxide
[06:32] <TheGilmanator> sc4ttrbrain: Sorry. Top right and bottom left.
[06:33] <monoxide> jrib: thanks
[06:33] <sc4ttrbrain> TheGilmanator: the config change to default every updates imo, so better to config it again and save it in separate name
[06:33] <ubox> jrib: it belongs to which distro..tht gkismet
[06:33] <monoxide> I should juse idle in here and ill know this os in no time

[06:36] <sc4ttrbrain> TheGilmanator: is it still not functionable even if u re config it?
[06:36] <monoxide> just kismet will work if it will make my life easier lol
[06:36] <monoxide> olny diffrence is gkismet has a gui
[06:36] <ubox> then i think u have it
[06:36] <monoxide> but I can work with the command line
[06:36] <CientificoLoco> hello
[06:36] <jrib> yep ubox is right
[06:36] <sc4ttrbrain> TheGilmanator: how do u get packages?
[06:36] <TheGilmanator> sc4ttrbrain: It works with the keyboard and top-left, bottom-right. I've got top-right set to pull up the picker for the current app and bottom-left for window picker for all workspaces. They just don't do anything.

[06:37] <CientificoLoco> how do I install the plugin for firefox of shockwave ???
[06:37] <monoxide> you can do it right thru firefox
[06:37] <TheGilmanator> sc4ttrbrain: I got the update with apt-get through bery-project.org
[06:37] <jrib> monoxide: you'll have to enable universe repository.  Afterwards, you can use synaptic to install it
[06:37] <jrib> ubox: tell monoxide about universe
[06:38] <ubox> jrib: u know which vlc plugin should i use to play *.flv?
[06:38] <jrib> CientificoLoco: adobe does not provide a shockwave plugin for linux.  Your only chance is a firefox installed in wine
[06:38] <sc4ttrbrain> TheGilmanator: im using trevino`s repo, u may want to killall emerald and beryl-manager then...

[06:49] <TheGilmanator> sc4ttrbrain: That's too scary for a semi-n00b like myself. (Actually, I"m just lazy. If I can't "apt-get install" it, I must not really need it.)
[06:49] <glimmerati> any sir??
[06:49] <monoxide> few stumps here and there but what do u expect from having no prior knowledge of the os
[06:49] <DigitalNinja> anyone here using a ATI 7500?

[07:38] <startswithz> yoshig3 I don't know about VLC but I'm using mplayer without any problems
[07:39] <MaestroTechie> gotit: is your goal to make your LCD a certain refresh rate, or change the resolution?

[07:46] <gotit> in the xorg file it says modes are 1024.786  800*600 and 64*48
[07:46] <Zelda_> hello peope
[07:46] <Zelda_> er people

[07:47] <MaestroTechie> gotit: and what is the problem you are having?
[07:47] <Zelda_> Again, how do I tell if my components of my computer are installed correctly in device manager?
[07:47] <screechingcat> paloyme: there's a config tool for HP printers in called HPLIP or something. i remember seeing something there about sharing once
[07:47] <gotit>  the problem ?? i cant change the resolution
[07:48] <paloyme> where can i find this HPLIP?
[07:48] <mrisis> Not sure Zelda some of mine are blue some are grayed out, I'm new too, lol
[07:48] <Zelda_> lol!
[07:48] <screechingcat> paloyme: try running hplip. its in system>prefs>hplip toolbox
[07:48] <MaestroTechie> gotit: when you load ubuntu, what resolution is displayed?
[07:48] <Zelda_> Im thinking of switching over altogether before Vista comes out.
[07:48] <gotit> 640*48
[07:48] <Zelda_> or soon there after.
[07:48] <gotit> 640*480
[07:48] <paloyme> uhmmm... i tink i still need to install this... ok thanks for the tip tho screeching cat
[07:49] <mrisis> Same here, use to run Mandrake 8 a few yrs back
[07:49] <screechingcat> paloyme: and if you cant see it, it might not be shown by default. just open the menu editor and check the box next to hplip
[07:49] <gotit>  i changed my crt with lcd , it was fine on crt
[07:49] <screechingcat> paloyme: its installed by default
[07:49] <Zelda_> If I were to pickup a Ubuntu beginners book to read to learn, which would be a good one?
[07:49] <amattas> is edgy using gnome screensavers or xscreensaver?
[07:49] <screechingcat> Zelda_: the official Ubuntu Book
[07:50] <mrisis> I'm not sure I've been reading all over the net, lol
[07:50] <Zelda_> thats what its called?
[07:50] <Zelda_> Ive seen a couple on Amazon.
[07:50] <screechingcat> Zelda_: something like that
[07:50] <Zelda_> like ubuntu for the un geek

[07:50] <mrisis> Lol
[07:50] <rastilin> How detailed is it?
[07:50] <SeyToN> sounds interesting :)
[07:50] <Zelda_> and ubuntu from novice to professional
[07:50] <MaestroTechie> gotit: delete the 640*480 out of your your xorg.conf. this will give ubuntu no choice to pick the higher resolution.
[07:50] <gotit> i cant change my screen res it was working fine with my crt and i changed to lcd and now its 640*480
[07:50] <screechingcat> Zelda_: i read ubuntuguide.org and the system documentation. thats enough for me
[07:51] <gotit> delete from whre
[07:51] <Zelda_> well, Im very new to Linux. I just installed Ubuntu on Sat.

[07:52] <screechingcat> Zelda_: well at one point i was new too. trust me, the best way to learn is to just keep using it
[07:52] <MaestroTechie> gotit: make it say: Modes      "1024x768" "832x624" "800x600"
[07:52] <gotit> it is already like this

[07:53] <AzMoo> gotit, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[07:53] <MaestroTechie> gotit: are you doing dual monitors?
[07:53] <Zelda_> Is there a beginners guide to Ubuntu in a book? Or Linux?
[07:53] <gotit> no dual moniors
[07:53] <rastilin> Zelda_: Yes, there are tonnes.
[07:53] <gotit> AzMoo: ok

[07:53] <screechingcat> Zelda_: well i guess you could read the linux bible
[07:53] <Zelda_> Like, Windows for dummies, only for linux?
[07:54] <mrisis> Dont have to use command line
[07:54] <rastilin> Zelda: I hope not. I'm hoping it's a bit more complicated.
[07:54] <Zelda_> well this is a lot more complicated for me.
[07:54] <rastilin> Zelda_: The Redhat networking manual is also very good, it's an eye opener about what you can do with linux.
[07:54] <gotit> AzMoo: its asking me to select the video card
[07:54] <Zelda_> I will learn over time. I want to get a book to read about the basics and how to use Ubuntu/Linux
[07:55] <screechingcat> Zelda_: if you want the basics only, i suggest the web
[07:55] <gotit> AzmMoo: and i dont know what card i have
[07:55] <AzMoo> gotit, er, ok. ctrl+c that.
[07:55] <MaestroTechie> lol
[07:56] <Zelda_> well I want a book. Im good with hands on.
[07:56] <gotit> AzMoo:i am on terminal
[07:56] <MaestroTechie> didn't they come out with a book called "Linux for the non-computer user" or something like that?
[07:56] <Zelda_> Ill definately look into those that have been mentioned.
[07:56] <screechingcat> Zelda_: like i said, read the official linux book
[07:56] <MaestroTechie> gotit: type: lspci
[07:56] <gotit> ok
[07:56] <rastilin> There's an *official* book?
[07:56] <MaestroTechie> not really official.
[07:57] <tonyyarusso> rastilin: yep
[07:57] <MaestroTechie> gotit: look for something that says ATI or nVidia.
[07:57] <tonyyarusso> MaestroTechie: sure it is
[07:57] <gotit> the screen is filled
[07:57] <screechingcat> rastilin: sorry that was meant to be official ubuntu book. which there is

[07:57] <MaestroTechie> tonyyarusso: it is?
[07:57] <tonyyarusso> MaestroTechie: "The Official Ubuntu Book" - I have a copy here.

[07:57] <Zelda_> oh, how do I set this so everytime I want to do something it wont ask me for a password?
[07:58] <gotit> everything is intel
[07:58] <tonyyarusso> screechingcat: It's fantastic for a new user; gets less useful as you gain experience.  (I'm hoping they make an advanced version some day)
[07:58] <rastilin> "Beginning Ubuntu from Novice to Professional"?
[07:58] <screechingcat> Zelda_: well thats the reason many people switch to linux
[07:58] <Zelda_> yeah thats the book I saw on Amazon
[07:58] <paloyme> rastilin.... lol
[07:58] <rastilin> Zelda_: You run as root. But Ubuntu is built to prevent that, it's a security risk?

When I boot the install CD, I get the screen with the little progress indicator for about 30 seconds, then the screen goes blank and my monitor says "Can not display this mode."   I reboot and try hitting F4 to change the resolution but it does not help.   What to do?!
[08:05] <saif_indore> can somebody help me
[08:05] <yunhual> it is no necessary to install man or header file to the target machine, when build the embedded system, can i specify don't install those files through ./configure, make or make install, if i can, how to get that ??
[08:05] <Zelda_> then y are there Panda antivirus for linux?
[08:05] <MaestroTechie> gotit: now go back to what Azmoo said: AzMoo: gotit, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[08:05] <tonyyarusso> !virus | Zelda_
[08:05] <ubotu> Zelda_: A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[08:05] <rastilin> Zelda_, because files can have windows viruses
[08:05] <Zelda_> well I know that.
[08:05] <gotit> ok
[08:05] <MaestroTechie> Zelda_: you can use Linux as a file server for windows
[08:06] <Zelda_> I know that I dont need virus protection, I was just curious why they have them
[08:06] <MaestroTechie> Zelda_: and you can't just install McAfee on Ubuntu
[08:06] <Zelda_> fuck mcafee
[08:06] <gotit> its not present there
[08:06] <MaestroTechie> lol
[08:06] <tonyyarusso> msun: It's possible that you could install with the alternate CD and it would be fine.  The Live CD has limited capabilities for graphical modes b/c of space, but an installed system can be more flexible.

[08:07] <gotit> oh shut up MaestroTechie
[08:07] <MaestroTechie> gotit: he says he gets the desired resolution with his CRT
[08:08] <paloyme> what user/pass is the cups web interface asking for?
[08:08] <Zelda_> or that maybe he doesnt have widescreen support installed yet.
[08:08] <paloyme> i cant seem to get in using my user/pass

[08:09] <blackflare> I think the installer can do it for you
[08:09] <mrisis> Same here, Xp Pro
[08:09] <TiG4> blackflare, ah ok thanks
[08:09] <MaestroTechie> blackflare: why dualboot? i much rather swap hard drives out before I dual boot with windoze.
[08:09] <arrenlex> paloyme: ...that's a good point.
[08:09] <fangorious> using plain sysvinit I could remove S13[gdm,kdm]  from the /etc/rc3.d and then rc3 was a networked, multi-user, console login. how do I do that with upstart (already tried deleting the fiels in /etc/rc3.d with no effect)
[08:09] <gotit> CAN ANY ONE PLZ HELP ME
[08:09] <blackflare> cause I never used linux before and had no idea how it was going to go
[08:09] <paloyme> arrenlex, so how do i get in?
[08:09] <squeee> gotit: NOT IN CAPS
[08:09] <tonyyarusso> !helpme | gotit
[08:09] <ubotu> gotit: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:10] <dakira> TiG4: Ubuntu sets up a second partition for you.. it also automatically resized your windows partition if you wish so..
[08:10] <arrenlex> paloyme: I dunno.
[08:10] <dakira> has anyone got java 6 running, yet?
[08:10] <mrisis> Yup, Installer will partition the drive for you
[08:10] <MaestroTechie> blackflare: i would recommend using the LiveCD first....get a feel for it.
[08:10] <blackflare> its not a big deal, the main dive is like 50gb and has windows and a few programs and games, and theres a 120gb for media, and I added a 60 gb now for ubuntu
[08:10] <TiG4> dakira, non-descructive?
[08:10] <arrenlex> !attitude | tonyyarusso, gotit
[08:10] <ubotu> tonyyarusso, gotit: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[08:10] <robdeman> hey all what are exactly virtual host files?
[08:10] <AstralJava> gotit: I understand you're getting upset if you're not getting the right solution right off the bat, but believe it or not, there might be people in here right now who don't know it. Patiently asking some other time someone might have come in who knows. Shouting won't get you far. So what's the problem?
[08:10] <gotit> i am sick of not getting help i am here for 2 weeks almost
[08:10] <blackflare> I already installed it maestro :)
[08:10] <umop> anyone here able to help me with partimage setup
[08:11] <robdeman> im reading on how to setup TRAC on Ubuntu and they talk about 'add these lines to your VIRTUAL HOST' file..
[08:11] <MaestroTechie> blackflare: nice :)  you are so on the right road.
[08:11] <robdeman> what is it?
[08:11] <paloyme> how do i bypass the root security?
[08:11] <squeee> Is there a systat / iostat equivilant for linux?
[08:11] <AzMoo> gotit, do you know what video card you have yet?
[08:11] <gotit> AstralJave: gotit
[08:11] <tonyyarusso> !sudo | paloyme
[08:11] <ubotu> paloyme: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:11] <dakira> TiG4: i never recommended using this feature but alot of my friends used it anyway and said it worked fine for them
[08:11] <gotit> Thanks
[08:11] <gotit> cya l8r guys,
[08:11] <blackflare> haha, it works for me. My main machine will always be windows, but as an alternate for my tv tuner and web browsing its very speedy and clean
[08:11] <paloyme> thanks tony
[08:12] <blackflare> I have them linked with synergy, its nice
[08:12] <kurisutofuaa> Have some install issues with the vmware-server installer. I keep getting: Unable to copy the source file ./installer/services.sh to the destination file /etc/init.d/vmware. any got any ideas why it cant copy?
[08:12] <MaestroTechie> blackflare: i've seen synergy....it is very nice
[08:12] <ricardo> hey, does anyone knows the command to stop a port???????
[08:12] <dakira> TiG4: alternatively you can make room with partition magic prior the the ubuntu install.. or you can use the graphical partition editor on the ubuntu live-cd.. (which is pretty much the same as partition magic)
[08:12] <AstralJava> kurisutofuaa: No idea, but are you running the installer with sudo privileges?
[08:12] <blackflare> I kinda like the command line interface, its pretty fun to learn how to do things too.
[08:12] <fangorious> how do I edit runlevel startup services with upstart?
[08:12] <bradley> my gnome-settings-daemon has crashed, how would i restart it?
[08:12] <dakira> Again my Question: Has anyone installed Java 6, yet??
[08:12] <MaestroTechie> blackflare: i, too, use windows on my main machine. all my servers in my house are ubuntu. I run a MythTV box.
[08:13] <squeee> bradley: run in a terminal gnome-settings-daemon&
[08:13] <blackflare> If ive mounted my two windows partitions will they stay there when I reboot?
[08:13] <AzMoo> blackflare, they will if you put them in /etc/crontab
[08:13] <AzMoo> er
[08:13] <arrenlex> fstab
[08:13] <AzMoo> not crontab
[08:13] <cwillu> is festival broken right now?
[08:13] <blackflare> cause I cant remember what I did hahaha, I just copy pasted from a guide
[08:13] <AstralJava> blackflare: If you have made the changes into /etc/fstab, then yes.
[08:13] <kurisutofuaa> AstralJava, Yeah I am using sudo
[08:13] <AzMoo> fstab
[08:13] <fangorious> blackflare: if you put them in /etc/fstab
[08:13] <msun>  Help Request - I'm trying to install Ubuntu for the 1st time.  I have a Dell 1920x1200 widescreen LCD monitor.  When I boot the install CD, I get the screen with the little progress indicator for about 30 seconds, then the screen goes blank and my monitor says "Can not display this mode."   I reboot and try hitting F4 to change the resolution but it does not help.   What to do?!
[08:13] <AstralJava> kurisutofuaa: Then I don't know, sorry.
[08:13] <paloyme> tonyarusso, cant seem to find my answer to that site... im trying to access cups in web interface, its asking for a user/pass, i put it in, but doesnt seem to accept it
[08:13] <fangorious> msun: what video card?
[08:14] <blackflare> whats the command to put them in fstab?
[08:14] <msun> tony: i'm using the install cd, not lived
[08:14] <bradley> squeee, it doesn't work, it just sends me a bunch of critical warnings.
[08:14] <kurisutofuaa> AstralJava, that's alright
[08:14] <tonyyarusso> paloyme: Ah.  Add the 'cupsys' user to the 'shadow' group.
[08:14] <fangorious> msun: install cd is the live cd
[08:14] <ricardo> Hi, does anyone knows how to stop a port in ubuntu????? thanks
[08:14] <MaestroTechie> msun: you want to install in text only mode.
[08:14] <msun> fangorius:  not sure off the top of my head.   oh cd is the same?
[08:14] <rapid> ricardo, does unbuntu have /etc/services
[08:14] <tonyyarusso> msun: By the install CD, do you mean "Desktop" or "Alternate"?  Desktop is the same as Live.
[08:14] <fangorious> msun: what graphics card do you have?
[08:14] <MaestroTechie> msun: or is it called "non-graphical" mode?
[08:15] <paloyme> thanks tony
[08:15] <phrizer> Hi all, i'm trying to get a "nvidia gforce2 mx 100 ddr/200 ddr" agp card going on my dapper box, i followed the instruction on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia but now when i boot my system instead of seeing the GDM greeter, i get a 'white screen' only...
[08:15] <Zelda_> night
[08:15] <fangorious> msun there's a bug with ati/fglrx that usually affects laptops
[08:15] <squeee> bradley: Does it do it when you restart?
[08:15] <msun> tony / fago / maestro:    no i'm using a graphical install cd.  i don't know what videocard i have, but it's it's own card (not integrated).  so i need to try text-only somehow??
[08:15] <ricardo> rapid: yes it does
[08:15] <gotit> i have this file 855resolution_0.3-4_i386.deb on my memory stick how can i install it
[08:15] <rapid> ricardo, put a # in front of the port you want closed, then restart inetd
[08:16] <arrenlex> gotit: sudo dpkg -i 855resolution_0.3-4_i386.deb
[08:16] <tonyyarusso> msun: I'm not sure if you need to; I just know that if you're having graphics trouble at that stage it's worth a shot.
[08:16] <gotit> its on memory stick
[08:16] <paloyme> tonyarusso, cant seem to find the shadow group
[08:16] <msun> tony:   ok i guess i will try that thanks
[08:16] <arrenlex> gotit: Is this memory stick mounted?
[08:16] <bradley> squeee, when i restart it gets stuck at the splash screen unless i use the failsafe mode
[08:16] <msun> oh, what is the "alternative" cd you mentioned?
[08:16] <tonyyarusso> paloyme: It would likely be hidden from normal lists, but exists
[08:16] <gotit> yeah
[08:17] <paloyme> so how do i unhide it?
[08:17] <arrenlex> gotit: Then who cares?
[08:17] <rajiv_nair> bye guys
[08:17] <tonyyarusso> !alternate | msun
[08:17] <ubotu> msun: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[08:17] <paloyme> ooops see it, hehehe thanks tonyarusso
[08:17] <gotit> it says cannot access archive no such file or directory
[08:18] <msun> ubotu: for my purposes, would that be "just as good" as the Desktop CD which I have now?   Is "Dapper" an older release?
[08:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about for my purposes, would that be "just as good" as the Desktop CD which I have now?   Is "Dapper" an older release? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:18] <kuto> hey guys
[08:18] <saif_indore> hi
[08:18] <Catshrimp> Any ideas why the fglrx driver wouldn't install properly?  I've run "sudo aptitude install xorg-driver-fglrx" and run "sudo dpkg-reconfig xserver-xorg"
[08:18] <gotit> arrenlex: it says no such file of directory
[08:18] <kuto> anyone learning ABS-GUIDE.pdf?
[08:18] <fangorious> is there an upstart manual anywhere?
[08:19] <rapid> ricardo, how'd that go
[08:19] <gotit> oh wiat i should copy paste the fiel
[08:19] <Catshrimp> Yet even after a full reboot, running "glxinfo | grep -i opengl" still shows that the mesa drivers are installed
[08:19] <Catshrimp> What gives?
[08:19] <ricardo> rapid: I just tried, but it did not work, any other suggestion
[08:19] <ricardo> ?
[08:19] <rapid> ricardo, did you start inetd?
[08:19] <paloyme> tonyarruso, still not working, it still wont accept my user/pass
[08:19] <kuto> when i do the stuff in ABS-GUIDE.pdf there seems to be bash incompatibilities
[08:19] <kuto> can someone help pls
[08:19] <rastilin> Catshrimp; Did you change the xorg.conf file?
[08:19] <arrenlex> gotit: cd to your stick first.
[08:19] <Jeffm515> morning everyone...
[08:19] <rapid> |Homer|, hey ho
[08:20] <kuto> hi Jeffm515
[08:20] <kuto> hi rapid
[08:20] <tonyyarusso> paloyme: it's configured to allow web inteface admin and the cups user can access the /etc/shadow file?  Hmm
[08:20] <kuto> hi |Homer|
[08:20] <Jeffm515> I need some help networking... between Xp and 6.10
[08:20] <ricardo> rapid: start inet something like "#83 start inet"?
[08:20] <kuto> hi tonyyarusso
[08:20] <gotit> i just pasted the file in my admim dir
[08:20] <tonyyarusso> Hi kuto
[08:20] <kuto> hi ric
[08:20] <kuto> hi gotit
[08:20] <rapid> ricardo, kill `pidof inetd`
[08:20] <kuto> hi ricardo
[08:20] <kuto> hi rap
[08:20] <gotit> setting up res
[08:20] <kuto> hi rapid
[08:20] <tonyyarusso> kuto: No need to say hi to everyone though
[08:20] <Jeffm515> lemme rephrase.. how the heck do you share files between xp and ubuntu?
[08:20] <gotit> hast been configured
[08:20] <rapid> kuto, what up dawg
[08:20] <kuto> when i do the stuff in ABS-GUIDE.pdf there seems to be bash incompatibilities
[08:20] <Catshrimp> rastilin: well, I haven't edited xorg.conf other than running dpkg-reconfigure on xserver-xorg
[08:20] <kuto> any ideas anyone
[08:21] <g1gaman> gentlemen, i am going to install ubuntu on two small harddisks from alternata cd and decided to create /usr and /home on hdb (/ and /swap stays on hda). Which partitions should be primary/logical, which should be at the beginning/end of the drive, which should be marked with boot flag. Any suggstions?
[08:21] <ricardo> rapid: what is pidof? will it kill all the ports?
[08:21] <rapid> can someone tell ricardo how to restart inetd services on ubuntu please
[08:22] <kuto> g1gaman: any of the mounting points in linux could be primary and logical
=== mrisis is now known as Zero_Fill
[08:22] <rapid> ricardo, I don't ubuntu, but yes it will close all the ports if the command runs, a simple "inetd" should bring them back
[08:22] <kuto> g1gaman: make sure to make an extended partition and then a logical drive once you have created 3 partitions in a hard drive
[08:23] <Catshrimp> ricardo: inet.d is dangerous to use
[08:23] <kuto> g1gaman: i dunno if ubuntu's gparted do that automagically for you
[08:23] <rapid> Catshrimp, why?
[08:23] <kuto> ok someone help me too
[08:23] <rapid> isn't there a inetd - restart?
[08:23] <rapid> or something
[08:23] <Catshrimp> rapid: it's got a bug in the code (though I don't remember where)
[08:23] <Hellevator> how can i get my internet working in console?  I did ifconfig eth0 up.  What do i need to do after that to get an ip address
[08:23] <Catshrimp> rapid: however, I believe the bug allows for a system takeover
[08:23] <rapid> Catshrimp, um right.
[08:24] <saif_indore> My system crashed after upgrading kernel
[08:24] <rapid> Hellevator, ifconfig eth0 youripaddress here
[08:24] <Jeffm515> I need some help networking... between Xp and 6.10... anyone?
[08:24] <paloyme> arrrgh!!! ubuntu is getting on my nerves, i just wanted to share my printer on a windows network and these other "roadblocks" keeps on popping up
[08:24] <rapid> Hellevator, if it uses dhcp type dhcpcd eth0
[08:24] <yoshig3> !paste
[08:24] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:24] <rastilin> Jeffm515, what's the problem?
[08:24] <Catshrimp> rapid: mmmk dude, you keep runnin it :)  I used to run fbsd and obsd which is much stabler and much more security oriented than any linux project ;)
[08:24] <rapid> Catshrimp, you do that/.
[08:25] <Jeffm515> I have no idea where to start..basically, I just need to move files off my laptop onto my ubuntu machine.
[08:25] <Hellevator> rapid, thanks
[08:25] <gotit> what should i do to save the modified file 855resolution
[08:25] <rapid> Hellevator, anytime.
[08:25] <rastilin> So, share the folder off the laptop and download them over with Samba?
[08:25] <Jeffm515> rastiin: how..
[08:25] <Jeffm515> rastiin: that's the question
[08:25] <kronoman> ricardo: try : sudo /etc/init.d/inetd restart
[08:25] <ricardo> rapid: thanks a lot. I figured out that altough my program stopped, I have to kill it in order to free the computer. My problem is solved. Thanks a lot for your time
[08:25] <corevette> how do you make channels in xchat start when xchat is started
[08:26] <rastilin> Well, you have to enable file and printer sharing on windows. Through network settings, then you right click, share folder on the folder holding the files.
[08:26] <rapid> corevette, you add them to your auto join list in the networks section
[08:26] <Jeffm515> okay, and then on the ubuntu machine?
[08:26] <gotit> what should i do to save the modified file 855resolution
[08:26] <rastilin> Places>Network Servers and the folders should show up
[08:26] <rapid> ricardo, np
[08:26] <corevette> rapid, wher in the network settings
[08:27] <Jeffm515> windows network shows up.. and there's nothing in there...
[08:27] <rastilin> Did you share the folder?
[08:27] <rapid> corevette, press ctrl+s, choose your network, click edit, then under channels
[08:27] <Jeffm515> yup
[08:27] <rastilin> Everything plugged into the same network?
[08:27] <rapid> corevette, for more than 1 channel, #linux,#linux2,#etc
[08:27] <Jeffm515> yup, laptop's wireless though
[08:28] <rastilin> Jeffm515, ah it would be. Can you ping it from ubuntu?
[08:28] <starfishy> i am trying to run Xgl and it will start up but crashes when i open any application that has to do with text in- or output
[08:28] <Zero_Fill> Both machines on the same network name, eg, HOME
[08:28] <Jeffm515> yup
[08:28] <starfishy> oh, and the same happened with Edgy and now with Feisty
[08:28] <Catshrimp> rastilin: everything I would need to run the fglrx driver would be included in the depends, right?  (because I know I had trouble getting the xserver running because it's depends didn't include x-window-system-core)
[08:28] <glimmerati> recently I lost one of my word document password.. now I need to open it.. can any one tell me how to??
[08:29] <rapid> glimmerati, shrug, I'd google for a word document password crack
[08:29] <rastilin> Catshrimp, I use nvidia, so no clue
[08:29] <glimmerati> rapid: is there any
[08:30] <Catshrimp> rastilin: ah, no problem, that's what I'm runnin on the nice desktop also.  Just had to go with ati (ick) on the lappy unfortunately :/
[08:30] <rapid> glimmerati, google has a better chance of knowing than me
[08:30] <rapid> glimmerati, i bet there is
[08:30] <TheRatKing> yo
[08:31] <kazim59> hello all
[08:31] <Zero_Fill> Hi Kazim
[08:31] <glimmerati> there is no free
[08:31] <rapid> corevette, all good?
[08:31] <kelvie> I added a custom repo to sources.list with newer versions of software -- I just commented it out, how do I revert to the old versions of everything?
[08:31] <kazim59> i m trying to compile a package from its source... ./configure works fine... but make is giving errors!
[08:31] <kelvie> apt-get refuses to do a downgrade
[08:31] <rastilin> kazim59, what are the errors?
[08:31] <blackflare> are there any cool must have apps to grab for a new ubuntu install?
[08:31] <corevette> rapid, yup thanks
[08:31] <rastilin> blackflare, you mean other than all the codecs
[08:32] <rapid> ...
[08:32] <rapid> corevette, cool.
[08:32] <TheRatKing> any specific type of apps you looking for?
[08:32] <blackflare> hmm let me think
[08:32] <blackflare> I have gaim, for aim
[08:32] <Zero_Fill> First thing I picked up rastilin
[08:32] <blackflare> I found tvtime for tv
[08:32] <kazim59> rastilin: i m trying to install obexftp... ./configure reports no errors... make tells me undefined reference to 'hci_open_dev' and many similar functions of sdp and hci and baswap
[08:32] <blackflare> I did get vlc
[08:32] <Jeffm515> rastiin: okay, looks like it just needed to reauth to the network.. it's going now.. thx
[08:33] <blackflare> I think I have my basic necessities, but Im just curious if theres any fun things or really useful stuff I wouldnt see on windows
[08:33] <gotit> Hurrah i done it from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[08:33] <gotit> rastilin : thankyou
[08:33] <Zero_Fill> Beryl
[08:33] <kazim59> Zero_Fill: i've reduced the errors much.. i installed many packages related to sdp ..
[08:33] <TheRatKing> you program? get build-essential
[08:34] <gotit> but commands are difficult to remember
[08:34] <sivik> how do i make sure something runs when the machine starts, or how do i tell it to run it when it stars
[08:34] <sivik> starts*
[08:34] <Catshrimp> later guys
[08:34] <rapid> sivik, you should add it to your start up scripts normal in /etc/rc*
[08:35] <sivik> all of them, i have like 7 rc#.d
[08:35] <gotit> whats the diff between 6.06 and 6.10
[08:35] <gotit> whats the diff between 6.06lts ofcourse and 6.10
[08:35] <sivik> newer kernel and newer versions of programs
[08:35] <rapid> isn't there a changelog
[08:35] <rapid> or changes
[08:35] <rastilin> gotit, what's the difference between 2000 and xp?
[08:35] <gotit> which one is newer
[08:35] <fangorious> how do I specify a runlevel at the grub menu with upstart? in dapper I could hit 'e' at the grub menu, and put the number of the runlevel at the end of the kernel command
[08:36] <rapid> obviously the latter
[08:36] <gotit> lol
[08:36] <sivik> 6.10
[08:36] <rapid> fangorious, lilo uses, kernelname level x
[08:36] <gotit> rastilin: thanks i set my resolution
[08:36] <rapid> fangorious, not sure if that works in grub
[08:36] <rastilin> gotit, glad to hear that
[08:37] <sivik> rapid: which rc#.d folder and what file
[08:37] <rapid> sivik, do you have a rc.local in there?
[08:37] <sivik> yes, i have a rc.local in that folder
[08:37] <blackflare> oh I know, what program can I use to check my cpu / mobo temp?
[08:37] <rapid> sivik, put what ever you need in there
[08:37] <gotit> i installed it from the live cd 6.06 is it the server version
[08:37] <blackflare> I had an asus probe program before, so I know the sensors are in there
[08:38] <Zero_Fill> I use gdesklets for the eye candy
[08:38] <sivik> rapid: what if i need to run it as sudo, is that a problem if i log in as a normal user?
[08:38] <paolo> Hi... is there a way to deny the access to KDE to users A, B? (they must access only ICEWM)
[08:38] <rastilin> paolo, deny access? You can configure gdm to boot them on icewm.
[08:39] <rapid> sivik: whatever in there, should be run as sudo, I presume, I am not ubuntu orientated that much.
[08:39] <kazim59> rastilin: what should i do now?
[08:39] <phrizer> Hi all, i'm trying to get a "nvidia geforce2 mx 100 ddr/200 ddr" agp card going on my dapper box, i followed the instruction on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia but now when i boot my system instead of seeing the GDM greeter, i get a 'white screen' only then freeze.. i can still ssh in though from another machine...
[08:39] <kazim59> rastilin: make gives me linker errors....
[08:40] <paolo> rastlin, I see but this is not my aim. I want a particular window manager (KDE) for an an user, and another window manager (ICEWM) for another user
[08:40] <rapid> sivik, I have some commands running on start up that only will be run as root and they are in my rc.local running fine
[08:40] <sivik> but are you logged in as root on the machine?
[08:40] <rastilin> Yea, you can configure gdm to launch different window managers for every user.
[08:40] <gotit> whats the diff between ubuntu and kbuntu
[08:40] <rastilin> Gnome and KDE
[08:40] <rapid> paolo, in their home dir, change the .xinitrc
[08:40] <rapid> sivik: not at the moment, only a user
[08:40] <Z> dualboot help pls
[08:41] <paolo> rapid, let's try
[08:41] <tanubis> Anyone know how to convert .avi files to .3gp for playback on a cellphone?
[08:41] <rapid> tanubis, theres software that comes with the phone tha tshould do it
[08:41] <Z> ubuntu pls
[08:41] <rapid> tanubis, nokia software
[08:41] <ablyss> tanubis, why not just playback 3gp w/ mpalyer?
[08:41] <rapid> ablyss, cause he wants to play them on the phone
[08:42] <paolo> rapid, I don't have this file
[08:42] <tanubis> the software that comes with my phone ONLY runs on windows, which I run nowhere in my house
[08:42] <paolo> (my distro is kubuntu)
[08:42] <rapid> tanubis, google avi to 3gp linux
[08:42] <TiG4> **** When I'm installing Ubuntu, how do I disable frame buffer?
[08:42] <NoonInSF> could using a firmware cutter ruin the firm ware on my wireless card?
[08:43] <glimmerati> sorry.. it is working
[08:43] <jrrs> TiG4: eg for serial console install?
[08:43] <rapid> paolo, hold on
[08:43] <Z> dualboot
[08:43] <paolo> thanks, rapid
[08:43] <sivik> NoonInSF, no, its a software firmware for linux, not a hardware firmware, broadcom?
[08:43] <Zero_Fill> Z, yes it can be done
[08:43] <TiG4> jrrs, Ubuntu freezes whenever I start in safe gfx mode, and when I start regular it goes crazy
[08:43] <fangorious> does upstart even support the concept of separate runlevels?
[08:43] <TiG4> jrrs, the graphics go haywire
[08:43] <tanubis> rapid: already tried that...  came across some guides for ffmpeg but I keep getting errors with it
[08:44] <TiG4> jrrs, any receommendations?
[08:44] <jrrs> TiG4: 1s, i can find the configs i used to do serial install ; that would probably be close analogue
[08:44] <NoonInSF> broadcom....i'm having major internet issues ever since i got my airport to "work" sivik
[08:44] <rapid> paolo, I believe making a .xinitrc script in the users home dir, will start which wm is called from this script
[08:44] <sivik> NoonInSF, what kind of card
[08:44] <J-_> !ssl
[08:44] <NoonInSF> airport broadcom
[08:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ssl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:44] <sivik> NoonInSF, try talking to bcm-users channel
[08:44] <Z> which should i choose for ubuntu dualboot,60GB+20GB or @)GB
[08:44] <uMISTA> how could i make a way to right click onto a iso and click mount, and it would mount a iso onto a folder i told it to?
[08:44] <NoonInSF> bcm?
[08:44] <J-_> !SSL
[08:44] <NoonInSF> there is a special channel?
[08:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about SSL - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:44] <uMISTA> so how to edit the right click options?
[08:45] <J-_> !lamp
[08:45] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[08:45] <paolo> rapid. i've found initrc script in ect/X11
[08:45] <ablyss> converting 3gp to avi might be a bit difficult as the audio codec for 3gp is only avaiable when compiled against mplayer
[08:45] <gotit> can any one plz tell me the difference in the simplest words wat gnome and kde is
[08:45] <uMISTA> GUI
[08:45] <rapid> done
[08:45] <rapid> :)
[08:45] <glimmerati> recently I lost one of my word document password.. now I need to open it.. can any one tell me how to??
[08:45] <Z> ???
[08:45] <rapid> glimmerati, why the hell are you asking in #ubuntu
[08:46] <rapid> Z, !!!
[08:46] <AlphaN3> hmm
[08:46] <Z> ?
[08:46] <rapid> !
[08:46] <glimmerati> cause i m stuck in a prb..
[08:46] <tanubis> ablyss converting from avi to 3gp...  there's gotta be something
[08:46] <rapid> there is
[08:46] <glimmerati> anyway.. i m looking into it..
[08:46] <glimmerati> thanks
[08:46] <jrrs> TiG4: in the 'pxelinux.cfg/default' i had first line "SERIAL 1 57600 0x112", line 2 "CONSOLE 0" and then in the 'append' line, i had the following in addition to whatever is already there: "vga=normal fb=false console=ttyS1,57600"
[08:46] <fangorious> uMISTA: I'm not sure you can, I think you need to be root to mount an iso, as it needs to use the loopback devices
[08:46] <jrrs> TiG4: i found most of that in the purple www page for SYSLINUX / PXELINUX
[08:46] <AlphaN3> I switched from xdm to gdm recently. The font size is now too small to read. Anyone can help me fix this?
[08:46] <Zero_Fill> Not sure I have xp on mine and gave ubuntu 30gigs to play with
[08:46] <Z> in dualboot
[08:46] <Z> which partition should i choose
[08:46] <TiG4> jrrs, let me show you the problem
[08:47] <AlphaN3> It used to be 75dpi. Now it's like 50.
[08:47] <TiG4> jrrs, http://www.reflexpoint.us/jholen/CIMG0450.JPG
[08:47] <Z> i have 60GB+20GB and 20GB
[08:47] <TiG4> jrrs, that's what happens when I run the installer
[08:47] <rapid> Z: ask your question on one line.
[08:47] <ablyss> tanubis: i've seen plenty of windows software to convert, but none for linux.  i'd assume you could save the raw media from mplayer as avi but I haven't tried
[08:47] <jrrs> TiG4: delightful... :/
[08:47] <fangorious> AlphaN3: System -> Administration -> Login Window
[08:47] <TiG4> jrrs, what's that look like to you? xorg issue?
[08:47] <TiG4> jrrs, its an nvidia
[08:48] <AlphaN3> well.. that wouldn't increase the size of many things, including xchat conversations and terminal, would it?
[08:48] <jrrs> TiG4: tbh other than seeing columns of R and G and B, no idea; i'm not the most useful wrt X11 stuff
[08:49] <AlphaN3> i'm actually on xubuntu and the shortcut links to gdmsetup
[08:49] <paolo> rapid, it's not a good solution: xinitrc is common for all users, and there's not an option which allows access only for specified users
[08:49] <TiG4> *** Anyone know what this could be? It happens whenever I try to boot off the install cd (edgy), I can't install. http://www.reflexpoint.us/jholen/CIMG0450.JPG
[08:49] <jrrs> TiG4: fwiw i also used that syslinux/pxelinux stuff for the debian installer and it gave me just straight text mode 'readline' interface i think for both ubuntu and debian
[08:49] <tanubis> ablyss Trying to convert back to .3gp for use on the cell phone.  I have a cell phone with 1GB of memory on it, and it's supposed to be a decent video player.  Conversion software comes with the phone to let you play .mp3 and .avi files in the playlist, but it DRMs everything and won't boot under anything but windows.  I'm trying to work around the phone's DRM so I can move media back and forth under linux.
[08:49] <rapid> tanubis http://blogentooth.blogspot.com/2006/01/convert-wmv-to-avi-avi-to-3gp.html
[08:49] <kuto> hey guys
[08:49] <rapid> paolo, ok
[08:49] <kuto> anyone know what happens when you update gcc versions?
[08:49] <AlphaN3> anyone knows a permanent workaround? i want 9pt to look like 9pt it used to be :/
[08:49] <tanubis> thanks
[08:50] <jrrs> TiG4: i also remember in one of the 'wiki' docs it mentioned hitting 'f1' on the first screen if things suck and you can get past it -- if you're already past the splash screen tho i might not be helping...
[08:50] <rapid> kuto: what else do you expect.
[08:50] <kuto> i got gcc3.4 installed... what happens if i install gcc4 will gcc3.4 be overwritten.. will the files be overwritten
[08:51] <sivik> if a file is located in the rc#.d folder, isn't the program supposed to start when the machine starts?
[08:51] <ablyss> tanubis: have you tried running wine
[08:51] <kuto> hi rapid do you know
[08:51] <gotit> as far as i searched an understood KDE is just a visuale enviroment am i right
[08:51] <fangorious> AlphaN3: you said the problem started when you changed from xdm to gdm
[08:51] <sivik> gdm = crap
[08:51] <jrrs> TiG4: maybe first see if just 'fb=false' in the 'append' stuff for the syslinux gets you to a non SVGA type install process?
[08:51] <rapid> kuto: It probably won't be overwritten, it will still exist.
[08:51] <AlphaN3> fangorious: yep.
[08:51] <sivik> kdm = the sh!t
[08:51] <tanubis> bleh... whoever came up with the bright idea of DRM should be shot
[08:51] <rapid> kuto: then if its all good, you can remove the old gcc
[08:51] <rastilin> sivik, then initialize with "startx"
[08:51] <AlphaN3> fangorious: i removed xdm prior to installing gdm. could that be the cause?
[08:51] <sivik> rastilin, wtf?
[08:51] <fangorious> AlphaN3: gdm uses it's own font settings as compared to your default session-wide fonts, i though
[08:52] <tanubis> ablyss: yes, even cedega.  The DRM software accepts windows, but it wants the latest version of sp2 winXP to run.  It's very picky.
[08:52] <rapid> sivik, didn't work?
[08:52] <sivik> rapid: i trying to run mythbackend when the machine starts
[08:52] <TiG4> jrrs, so what's the way to install it using non gui? what params do I type?
[08:52] <fangorious> AlphaN3: I wouldn't have thought so, but I haven't used xdm in years
[08:52] <sivik> fangorious, why did you change from xdm to gdm?
[08:52] <AlphaN3> fangorious: yeah, but there is the titlebar font and many others that won't be fixed from gdmsetup. hmph...
[08:52] <fangorious> AlphaN3: the distributions I use changed their defaults, and gdm works just fine for me
[08:53] <fangorious> er that was to sivik
[08:53] <AlphaN3> sivik: i did. i needed the ability to select window manager on logon.
[08:53] <ablyss> tanubis: i has a similar problem.  my phone is also able to make very nice 3gp videos ( w/ audio ) and after I d/l the videos via bluetooth to ubuntu I wasn't able to play them, until I compiled mplayer w/ 3gp audo/video
[08:53] <AlphaN3> oh :P
[08:53] <rapid> sivik, check this one, http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/
[08:53] <sivik> AlphaN3, kdm does that very nicely
[08:53] <AlphaN3> sivik: yep, but i'm on a 400-MHz notebook (:
[08:53] <jrrs> TiG4: i was doing it over pxeboot, so it might be a bit different, but the big win might be adding the 'fb=false' line to the 'append' clause in the syslinux(?) config
[08:53] <AlphaN3> kdm is a no-no.
[08:54] <sivik> AlphaN3, why is it a no-no?
[08:54] <jrrs> TiG4: i gathered that syslinux and pxelinux are not too far from the same thing, but might be showing my colours a bit there.... :(
[08:54] <TiG4> jrrs, huh? heh, basically all I need to know is. What do I add to the boot params
[08:54] <sivik> are you talking about being able to choose between xdm/gdm/kdm at startup or the actual xwindows session type?
[08:54] <fangorious> AlphaN3: but the titlebar font should be set separate from your [xgk] dm fonts, is there an xfce font selection tool?
[08:54] <AlphaN3> sivik: eats too much system resource.
[08:54] <tanubis> ablyss no problems playing the videos that I get off the phone... just problems encoding my library of music videos into something the phone will play.  It's doubling as my mp3 player and portable media device, but the thing isn't working because of the DRM stopping me moving files back and forth.
[08:54] <sivik> AlphaN3, which one are you trying to do?
[08:54] <AlphaN3> sivik: gdm!
[08:55] <yoshig3> Guys I need help
[08:55] <yoshig3> I have beryl working great
[08:55] <sivik> yoshig3, whats the problem
[08:55] <AlphaN3> fangorious: i don't think so.. well let me tell you the full story.
[08:55] <jrrs> TiG4: eg at the grub or whatever?
[08:55] <rapid> sivik, did you check that site?
[08:55] <ablyss> tanubis: bluetooth file transfer doesn't work ?
[08:55] <yoshig3> but, whenever I scroll using the scroll bar, on any app, it uses my CPU like 1000%
[08:55] <sivik> yoshig3, i know nothing about beryl
[08:55] <jrrs> TiG4: try 'terminal --dumb console'
[08:55] <yoshig3> *100%
[08:55] <jrrs> ( http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/terminal.html )
[08:55] <sivik> don't i have to enter a password to run a script like sudo mythbackend when the machine starts?
[08:56] <sivik> script that contains
[08:56] <fangorious> yoshig3: is there a scroll plugin in the beryl settings manager?
[08:56] <yoshig3> sivik: it's not beryl though
[08:56] <tanubis> ablyss: laptop doesn't support bluetooth, phone won't play non-drm'd files in player.
[08:56] <reverseblade> Hi I have bought a HP Pavilion dv6000 series, and I have serious problems. 1. Live CD doesn't boot it only boots with acpi=off option. 2. wireless doesn't work. it only works with ndis wrappers. 3. Sound doesn't work. 4 Open GL doesn't work. 5 most protected dvd's unreadable. 6. Fan speed is inconsistent 7. Suspension Hibernate does not work.  well what else left ?
[08:56] <sivik> yoshig3, whats the problem then
[08:56] <tanubis> rapid: thanks for the script
[08:56] <jrrs> the grammar on that page seems to be a bit off kilter, but i could be wrong
[08:56] <yoshig3> sivik: Just whenever I scroll anything, it takes 100% cput.
[08:56] <yoshig3> *cput
[08:56] <rapid> reverseblade, what a classic, have fun
[08:56] <yoshig3> grr
[08:56] <yoshig3> *cpu
[08:56] <ablyss> tanubis: why doesn't laptop support bluetooh? I thought all you needed was USB
[08:56] <sivik> rapid, like a script that says "sudo mythbackend"
[08:57] <AlphaN3> fangorious: My last setup was the default xubuntu install, plus ion3. Everything worked like a charm. Various font sizes cooperated. Then some accident happened, and i lost my /bin.
[08:57] <somerville32> !dvd | reverseblade
[08:57] <ubotu> reverseblade: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[08:57] <jrrs> TiG4: i don't know if the rest of the install will inherit the 'dumb terminal' action from that , which i think might be where the 'fb=false' comes into play, so perhaps 'append fb=false' also ?
[08:57] <fangorious> yoshig3: that sounds like a beryl problem, trying to do gl rendering in software instead of hardware
[08:57] <tanubis> ablyss usb to phone works fine... no bluetooth tech on the laptop though
[08:57] <rapid> sivik, I don't use sudo, so I can't help, soryr.
[08:57] <sivik> rapid, what do you use instead?
[08:57] <fangorious> AlphaN3: did you re-install at that point?
[08:57] <ablyss> tanubis: they make usb bluetooth doogles.
[08:57] <rapid> for like $20
[08:57] <sivik> rapid, then how do you run stuff as admin without doing either sudo everytime you run a command or doing sudo su
[08:57] <somerville32> !sound | reverseblade
[08:57] <ubotu> reverseblade: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[08:57] <yoshig3> fangorious: but I have a decent graphics card, it's not the card
[08:58] <tanubis> ablyss the phone really doesn't like accepting files to play in there.  I'm trying to work around the DRM by convincing the phone that my music files are actually videos I recorded with the phone's camcorder
[08:58] <yoshig3> fangorious: it's ubuntu
[08:58] <jrrs> sivik: sorry to hop in in the middle - but if it is relevant - you can setup sudoers(5) to not require password for certain Cmnd_Alias(es), and then point that Cmnd_Alias to whatever you want to run w/o a password
[08:58] <somerville32> !wireless | reverseblade
[08:58] <ubotu> reverseblade: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[08:58] <jrrs> ( if you don't wanna do everything passwordless )
[08:58] <rapid> sivik, i su - every time
[08:58] <rapid> :)
[08:58] <fangorious> yoshig3: i have a good graphics card too, and using xgl+beryl opengl screensavers spike to 100% cpu
[08:58] <sivik> jrrs, how would i go about doing it
[08:58] <AlphaN3> fangorious: So I reinstalled the system from scratch, using the minimum setup as the base this time (i didn't want totem and something else). I installed XDM, and played with it for a while. And it worked fine, but XDM was inadequate for my need. So I aptitude remove xdm, aptitude install xdm, and arrived here.
[08:58] <jrrs> sivik: man sudoers
[08:58] <dxdt> fangorious, that is one of the problems with xgl
[08:58] <jrrs> sivik: it's kinda tricky but it's not terrible
[08:58] <reverseblade> somerville32, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/hp_dv6000_series_%28dv6116eu%29?highlight=%28dv6000%29
[08:59] <dxdt> fangorious, aiglx shouldn't do that.  Sigh if only the fglrx drivers worked with aiglx
[08:59] <yoshig3> fangorious: i'm not using xgl, I didn't need to, using beta drivers
[08:59] <AlphaN3> sivik: i think it's sudo -i
[08:59] <somerville32> !fan | reverseblade
[08:59] <ubotu> reverseblade: fan is Control the fan  on/off  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-12058.html
[08:59] <sivik> so i would put my user name as NAME for   Cmnd_Alias ::= NAME = Cmnd_List
[08:59] <reverseblade> somerville32, it is not that simple
[08:59] <tanubis> General non-related question: Does anyone know of a distro similar to Kubuntu in ease-of-use that will run on a very old system (like pentium 166) comfortably?
[08:59] <fangorious> dxdt: I know, I'm trying to convince yoshi3g that a sudden 100% cpu spike could very much be a beryl problem
[08:59] <somerville32> tanubis, Xubuntu?
[08:59] <sivik>  tanubis xubuntu
[08:59] <reverseblade> tanubis, use xubuntu
[08:59] <tanubis> thanks all...
[09:00] <jrrs> sivik: basically you setup a Cmnd_Alias and point that off to some binary or script, then down in the bottom you can say 'someuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: mycmndalias' in addition to whatever you have there
[09:00] <rapid> brb
[09:00] <jrrs> sivik: using visudo(8) to edit /etc/sudoers is a good move, as it will warn you of bad syntax so you don't tank the file and thus can't run sudo
[09:00] <somerville32> reverseblade, Try fixing one problem at a time :] 
[09:00] <dxdt> tanubis, maybe, maybe Vector Linux
[09:00] <fangorious> AlphaN3: well, you might look at /etc/X11/xorg.conf, gdmsetup, and whatever the xfce font tool is
[09:01] <sivik> jrrs: i will try and mess with that tomorrow, i'm offically way too tired for that to make sense
[09:01] <dxdt> tanubis, will let you do KDE, which Kubuntu uses, and I know they do pkg management through apt like ubuntu.  At least I"m fairly sure they do.
[09:01] <screechingcat> how do i export a manual to a text file ?
[09:01] <AlphaN3> fangorious: alright, thanks for the advice (:
[09:01] <sivik> screechingcat, man filename > filename.txt
[09:01] <fangorious> yoshig3: did you at least look to see if there's a scroll plugin? there's a resize plugin, without with you can't resize a window, so there might be a scroll one too
[09:01] <fangorious> AlphaN3: sorry
[09:01] <screechingcat> sivik: thanks mate
[09:01] <jrrs> sivik: for example: "Cmnd_Alias  WHATEVER = /some/path/to/script", and then: "username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: WHATEVER"
[09:02] <sivik> jrrs, and that will work only for that one script and not all the times me as the user would want to do something as admin
[09:02] <jrrs> sivik: todd miller might have some examples on the sudo manpage, but bene a while since i checked
[09:02] <sivik> ok
=== sivik is now known as sivik-sleep
[09:02] <jrrs> sivik: it will work for all instances of /some/path/to/script -- check millert's www on it
[09:02] <yoshig3> How do I install a tar.gz of Firefox 2.0?
[09:03] <yoshig3> I have the old firefox on my system
[09:03] <AlphaN3> maybe i'll restart X.. hmm.. thanks anyway everyone who has helped
[09:03] <ski-worklap> yoshig3, apt-get upgrade?
[09:03] <dxdt> 2.0 is default on Edgy
[09:03] <schinkenbrot> i believe i can fly
[09:03] <schinkenbrot> i believe i can touch the sky
[09:03] <yoshig3> ski-worklap: doesn't upgrade firefox
[09:03] <jrrs> sivik-sleep: there're a few little tricky gotchas with syntax that can have unanticipated results, but if you're just doing this for convenience factor, it might be less of a paranoia concern
[09:03] <yoshig3> nope
[09:03] <dxdt> yoshig3, are you running edgy?
[09:04] <yoshig3> Oh well
[09:04] <yoshig3> I guess I do have 2.0
[09:04] <yoshig3> well damn
[09:04] <yoshig3> alright
[09:04] <yoshig3> my fault
[09:04] <yoshig3> And YES ENTER IS a punctuation
[09:04] <fangorious> yoshig3: you cd to the directory you want it in, and run 'tar xvzf <file>'
[09:04] <kelvie> Is there a repo with a newer version of the kernel (and headers)

[09:08] <robdeman> hey gang, how do I disable a Apache2 module in Ubuntu?
[09:08] <robdeman> or enable for that matter...
[09:08] <J-_> !.htaccess
[09:08] <ski-worklap> robdeman, look at mods-enabled
[09:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about htaccess - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:09] <robdeman> ski-worklap: I did.. do I just remove files from there?
[09:09] <robdeman> or is there some kind of command?
[09:09] <ski-worklap> teh command is "rm" :)
[09:09] <J-_> what directory/file do I 'AllowOverride All' for .htaccess to work?
[09:10] <ski-worklap> seriously tho, just rm symlins to mods-available that you want to delete, then apachectl restart
[09:10] <robdeman> ok thanks
[09:10] <robdeman> :)
[09:11] <fangorious> does edgy support runlevels 3-5, or just keep them around for nostalgia?
[09:12] <phrizer> Hi all, i'm trying to get a "nvidia geforce2 mx 100 ddr/200 ddr" agp card going on my dapper box, i followed the instruction on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia but now when i boot my system instead of seeing the GDM greeter, i get a 'white screen' only then freeze.. i can still ssh in though from another machine...
[09:12] <tonyyarusso> fangorious: You can use them, for sure.  By default they are the same as 2, but you can tweak to your needs.
[09:13] <J-_> when i go to restart my Ubuntu LAMP server, it says I don't have a fully qualified domain name? How can I change the setting to work with a redirect IP?
[09:13] <fangorious> tonyyarusso: how do I boot them?
[09:13] <tonyyarusso> fangorious: By putting the number at the end of the kernel line in your grub menu.
[09:14] <fangorious> tonyyarusso: doesn't seem to be supported in edgy, there's a handful of other people with the same question on the forum
[09:14] <umop> how do i reset the password for root?
[09:14] <tonyyarusso> fangorious: Interesting.  Edgy is using a new boot system, so something might have changed.
[09:15] <fangorious> tonyyarusso: is there a command I can run to tell me what runlevel it thinks I'm in?
[09:15] <tonyyarusso> fangorious: There are still /etc/rc#.d/ directories
[09:15] <tonyyarusso> fangorious: 'runlevel'
[09:15] <rapid> umop, passwd root ?
[09:15] <rapid> theres no root in ubuntu is there
[09:15] <tonyyarusso> !root | umop
[09:15] <ubotu> umop: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:16] <fangorious> tonyyarusso: i disabled gdm in runlevel 3, and putting '3' on my kernel line still puts me at a gdm screen
[09:16] <fangorious> :(
[09:16] <tonyyarusso> fangorious: Hrm.  I'll have to try it some time and see for myself.
[09:16] <paolo> ufff... I can't believe that for a so simple operation there is not a tip....
[09:16] <fangorious> runlevel says "S 2", although I'm sure I've rebooted since trying to boot into 3
[09:16] <umop> rapid, hmm..ive been trying that.  Not sure whats wrong, just trying to get partimaged running
[09:16] <sidny4> which package do I install for nvidia drivers? nvidia-glx or nvidia-settings?
[09:16] <rapid> the first 1
[09:17] <rapid> umop: theres no root in ubuntu
[09:17] <tonyyarusso> paolo: What was you question?
[09:17] <tonyyarusso> *your
[09:17] <jrrs> is it that there's no root, or that root's password is either '!'d or some random garble... ?
[09:17] <paolo> tonyyarusso: i have to deny the access to kde for a particular user
[09:17] <jrrs> ( assuming you did the 'admin user' thingy during install )
[09:17] <umop> rapid, yeah, I have sudo which is alos the first user, but i am being prompted for root's password
[09:18] <umop> rapid, I will probably figure it out
[09:18] <tonyyarusso> paolo: Interesting...how come?
[09:18] <jrrs> umop: eg "enter root password for maintenance" during single user mode?
[09:18] <tonyyarusso> jrrs: Root's password is hashed as *, yes.
[09:18] <paolo> tonyyarusso, there are two users: A must access to both kde and icewm, B must access only to icewm
[09:18] <paolo> I don't know how....
[09:19] <tonyyarusso> paolo: What would happen if you created a .kde directory (or whatever it is) for B and set the permissions to not let them read or write, so that KDE would fail to start?
[09:19] <sidny4> which package do I install for nvidia drivers? nvidia-glx or nvidia-settings?
[09:19] <tonyyarusso> !nvidia | sidny4
[09:19] <ubotu> sidny4: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:19] <jrrs> sidny4: 03:16 < rapid> the first 1
[09:19] <paolo> tonyyarusso, I've thought the same
[09:20] <Gesthemene> Hi guys, have just edited my xorg.conf file in an attempt to update my nvidia drivers. Good news is, now I can't get X :( Anyone able to help please?
[09:20] <paolo> but it's not a good way of proceeding
[09:20] <tonyyarusso> paolo: Not optimal, no.
[09:20] <tonyyarusso> paolo: I take it A and B are both seeing the same login screen (kdm or whatever)
[09:20] <rapid> Gesthemene, change nvidia to nv in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:20] <paolo> yes
[09:20] <paloyme> how do you edit a protected conf file? sudo... something something... i forgot....
[09:20] <tonyyarusso> paolo: You could also edit permissions on the kde binaries directly.
[09:20] <Gesthemene> ok.. will try (first time linux user)
[09:20] <jrrs> paloyme: sudoedit ?
[09:21] <paloyme> sudoeit?
[09:21] <owh> Anyone around here know of a backup package that takes into account that I'm running Ubuntu, that is, it doesn't backup the files that come from the packages that are installed, unless they've changed. Of course it would be good if it took note of partitions and installed packages :-)
[09:21] <paloyme> sudoedit?
[09:21] <tonyyarusso> paolo: I don't know how you would make a nice error message though - zenity script?
[09:21] <jrrs> paloyme: or sudo YOUR_FAVOURITE_EDITOR
[09:21] <tonyyarusso> !sudo | paloyme
[09:21] <ubotu> paloyme: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:21] <owh> paloyme: sudo gedit would do it.
[09:21] <paloyme> ok, how do you point to a file thats a few folders deep? is there a shortcut to it?
[09:21] <paolo> tonyyarusso, so: for which folder i mus chang the permissions?
[09:21] <tonyyarusso> owh: gksu in that case, since gedit is graphical
[09:21] <tonyyarusso> paolo: I'm not sure (no KDE here)
[09:21] <rapid> paloyme: use ln
[09:22] <paloyme> ln?
[09:22] <jrrs> paloyme: sudoedit is sudo(8) invoking $EDITOR on a copy of the file in question, such that changes to the file aren't moved back until you exit the editor
[09:22] <owh> tonyyarusso: Yes that would also work :-)
[09:22] <rapid> paloyme: create a symbolic link to the file you need.
[09:22] <tonyyarusso> paloyme: 'man ln' will tell you all of the necessary information about how to use it in-depth
[09:22] <paloyme> thanks tony
[09:23] <Gesthemene> Rapid, just edited it and am rebooting now. Hope it works :)
[09:23] <paloyme> is this applicable when doing, like for example, sudoedit /etc/salfkjdslfk/fasdfsdf/asdfasdf/asdfsadf/abc.conf?
[09:23] <yoshig3> Is there any program similar to Limewire that works for ubuntu?
[09:23] <paolo> tonyyarusso, the problem is that kde folders and files, in user's home dir, are run-time created
[09:23] <paloyme> is there a shortcut to that?
[09:23] <tonyyarusso> !limewire | yoshig3
[09:23] <ubotu> yoshig3: limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.
[09:23] <owh> paloyme: Type it into the terminal.
[09:23] <rapid> Gesthemene, you don't have to reboot
[09:23] <yoshig3> Thanks :D
[09:23] <Gesthemene> <headdesk>
[09:24] <yoshig3> !java
[09:24] <Nameeater> what package gives /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`/modules ?
[09:24] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[09:24] <tonyyarusso> paolo: Not all though, right?
[09:24] <owh> paloyme: Are you wanting to do this on an ongoing basis, or just once?
[09:24] <Gesthemene> oh well, it seemed to work anyway.
[09:24] <paloyme> yeah i know i need to type it to a terminal, but is there some shortcut, so that i wont need to type in those damn folders?
[09:24] <tonyyarusso> paolo: certainly the binaries would do the trick, just not glamorously
[09:24] <Nameeater> as I have linux-headers but there is only a symlink in the -386 folder, but no modules folder
[09:24] <paloyme> owh, just once
[09:24] <rapid> Gesthemene, mind you, theres no 3d extensions with that driver.
[09:24] <owh> paloyme: Use the tab key while you're typing.
[09:24] <paloyme> but since i dont know some of the folder name formats, i get errors and it sucks to repeat the whole folder name
[09:24] <tonyyarusso> paloyme: tab-complete :)
[09:24] <rapid> Gesthemene, hopefully it helps in the mean time
[09:25] <paloyme> i see... thanks ill try that
[09:25] <CraZyLeGs> is there support for PCMCIA wifi cards ?
[09:25] <rapid> of course.
[09:25] <owh> paloyme: It will complete the name, so cd /et[tab]  becomes /etc, or cd ~[tab]  becomes /home/{username}/
[09:25] <timfrost> Nameeater: linux-headers-`uname -r`
[09:25] <tonyyarusso> !wifi | CraZyLeGs
[09:25] <ubotu> CraZyLeGs: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:25] <paolo> tonyyarusso I can't find binaries associated only to kde
[09:25] <CraZyLeGs> thanks
[09:25] <Nameeater> timfrost: there is no modules folder :(
[09:25] <owh> !backup|owh
[09:25] <ubotu> owh: There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !cloning
[09:25] <tonyyarusso> paolo: 'startkde'?
[09:25] <jishin> I got mount: unknown filesystem type 'devfs' when booting to 2.6.19 kernel
[09:26] <owh> !cloning|owh
[09:26] <ubotu> owh: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type "dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages", move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type "sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade"
[09:26] <robdeman> What is Ubuntu 'Breeze' ?
[09:26] <paloyme> what does .folder/ mean?
[09:26] <Gesthemene> Rapid, Yeah.. I'm getting that.. this is a task set for me by my boss.. to get OpenGL drivers running. Since I only installed Ubuntu for the first time yesterday, it's proving interesting..
[09:26] <paolo> tonyyarusso, let's have a look
[09:26] <owh> paloyme: That's the name of a folder.
[09:27] <rapid> Gesthemene, cool. have fun
[09:27] <jrrs> paloyme: the 'dot' in front means it won't show up in ls(1) unless you include -a
[09:27] <paloyme> how do i access it in terminal? or how do i use it in sudoedit? ... sudoeit .folder/xxxfile.conf?
[09:27] <tonyyarusso> paloyme: yes
[09:27] <jrrs> paloyme: sure.  or ' cd .folder; sudoedit xxxfile.conf' or sudo vi or blahblah
[09:27] <paolo> tonyyarusso, it would be risky, since this executable is common for all users
[09:28] <tonyyarusso> paolo: You would need all other users included in the group, with g+x rights, lacking only the one user excluded.
[09:28] <paolo> i see, tonyyarusso but
[09:28] <paolo> it's risky
[09:28] <guillem101> palomer, the dot is only for default ls output filtering. Also Nautilus skips .dot files/folders if not told to show hidden files.
[09:28] <timfrost> Nameeater: sorry.  linux-headers is the headers for building modules outside the source tree.  The modules are part of the linux binary package, and are elsewhere in the tree.  What are you trying to do?
[09:28] <tonyyarusso> paolo: How is that risky?
[09:29] <paolo> tonyyarusso, this means that i have to change permissions for a shared system executable
[09:29] <tonyyarusso> paolo: You could also make a hand-off script that just runs that command, and point your login manager at it instead
[09:29] <owh> paloyme: May I ask what you're trying to edit. The reason I do is because the types of questions you're asking indicate that you are perhaps a novice user and without wanting to insult you, perhaps you're trying to fix something that isn't broken or can be addressed in another way.
[09:29] <uMISTA> trying to work out how to install opengl for wine can anyone help me
[09:30] <rapid> opengl for wine.. hmm fun
[09:30] <paolo> no, it's not a good solution
[09:30] <gouki> When is the new release coming out (Dapper Drake)? I think it may have the version number 6.06.02(?)
[09:30] <tonyyarusso> paolo: Well, if that's what you think you don't have to do it.  All I'm coming up with.
=== lastnode_ is now known as lastnode
[09:31] <frogzoo> uMISTA: umm... wine supports opengl out of the box....
[09:31] <owh> tonyyarusso: Do you know what paolo and paloyme are trying to do?
[09:31] <frogzoo> gouki: edgy
[09:31] <frogzoo> !edgy | gouki
[09:31] <ubotu> gouki: Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. Upgrading to Edgy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - Downloading: http://www.ubuntu.com/download - Release Notes: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[09:31] <uMISTA> ive try using it on warcraft but no go
[09:31] <tonyyarusso> gouki: Dapper (6.06) came out in June.  The first maintenance update (6.06.1) in August.  Edgy (6.10) came out in October.  There will likely be a second Dapper maintenance release (6.06.2) sometime, but there are no specific plans.
[09:31] <paolo> i'm sorry tonyyarusso, but it's a "critical" operation
[09:31] <paolo> and i have to do it
[09:32] <paolo> in the best way
[09:32] <gouki> I don't mean Edgy. I'm talking about the new release of Dapper Drake
[09:32] <frogzoo> !wow | uMISTA
[09:32] <ubotu> uMISTA: Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[09:32] <tonyyarusso> owh: Not sure about paloyme
[09:32] <gouki> tonyyarusso: Thank you. That's what I wanted to know
[09:32] <owh> tonyyarusso: That makes two of us.
[09:32] <frogzoo> uMISTA: what is your actual problem running wow?
[09:32] <reverseblade> you know linux doesn't work with entire HP pavilion 6000 series
[09:32] <tonyyarusso> paolo: Checked the forums and/or mailing list yet?
[09:33] <frogzoo> oh uMISTA, you're not using wine from the ubuntu repos are you ?
[09:33] <frogzoo> reverseblade: HP is very linux friendly these days, is that an old model?
[09:33] <paolo> tonyyarusso, yes, but with no results
[09:33] <owh> tonyyarusso: What's paolo attempting?
[09:33] <reverseblade> frogzoo, not is a brand new model
[09:34] <tonyyarusso> owh: Wants to prevent one particular user from logging into a KDE session from kdm, while allowing all others, but restricting this one to Icewm
[09:34] <frogzoo> reverseblade: well it's odd that you could buy those with linux support....
[09:34] <paolo> owh: I have to deny kde access for a particular user
[09:35] <Nameeater> timfrost: trying to compile a module for a webcam :)
[09:35] <reverseblade> frogzoo, well it doesn't even boot with live CD, you have to specify acpi=off as a boot option to boot it. 2ndly, wireless , sound, opengl doesn't work
[09:35] <rapid> paolo: i want your problem fixed.
[09:35] <paolo> ehehehh rapid:)
[09:35] <paloyme> ok, how do i move up a directory during the sudoedit "tab"
[09:35] <paolo> rapid, why?
[09:35] <paolo> :)
[09:35] <frogzoo> reverseblade: maybe redhat..
[09:35] <owh> paolo: Ok, lemmie google for a bit.
[09:35] <rapid> paolo: heard it so many times already :)
[09:35] <robdeman> hey folks im trying to install Trac.. it gives an Internal Server error.. which logfile do I want to check?
[09:35] <AlphaN3> k, i'm back >_> here's where it gets weird. removed gdm, font comes back to good size again.
[09:36] <paolo> thanks owh, I hope you would be more lucky than me
[09:37] <reverseblade> frogzoo, you mean fedora ? Btw, I am an experienced user with ubuntu using it for 1.5 years
[09:37] <timfrost> Nameeater: you don't need a modules directory in the headers tree.  Have you installed build-essential as well as the headers?
[09:37] <frogzoo> reverseblade: seeing as you can buy those with redhat support, I'd say fedora's a good bet
[09:37] <AlphaN3> but i don't want to logon from the console everytime, and i need to be able to logon to wmii, not just xfce. any advice?
[09:37] <bjorn-> http://www.digg.com/tech_news/Piratebay_strikes_back_blocks_Swedish_ISP
[09:37] <reverseblade> frogzoo, one more thing.My computer is "vista ready". Figure out how brand new it is.
[09:37] <Nameeater> timfrost: yes, the Makefile is complaining about not finding a modules folder I think
[09:37] <rapid> reverseblade, get rid of that sticker asap
[09:37] <frogzoo> reverseblade: vista ready machines don't exist :)
[09:37] <rapid> :)
[09:37] <rapid> they are ready to crash.
[09:37] <owh> paolo: Which login manager are you using?
[09:37] <timfrost> Nameeater: pastebin the output.
[09:38] <reverseblade> frogzoo, problem with HP pavilion dv6000 series  is not a ubuntu problem. It is a linux problem.
[09:38] <fallingdutch> i upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 yesterday, rebooted and when i wanted to login X crashed - the error seemed to be in /etc/bash_completion i have uncommented the lines in .bashrc then the x-session didn't crash. Now i start an app and X crashes again, but ran before.is there a known problem with /etc/bash_completion and any ideas why x crashes when starting the app, what changed between 6.10 and 6.06?
[09:38] <AlphaN3> a little flashback: i installed gdm, and all fonts suddenly appear painfully small. i removed it, and it's good again, but i need a logon manager. any idea?
[09:38] <PORDO> i'm having a problem..
[09:38] <paloyme> how do i access via a folder in terminal a file thats located at the root directory?
[09:38] <paolo> owh: kdm
[09:38] <PORDO> every time i try to hold on to a window and switch to a new workspace, it won't work.  this worked in dapper.
[09:38] <owh> Sorry, paolo, just saw that on the scollback :-)
[09:38] <paloyme> let me rephrase, how do i access a file in terminal that's located at the root directory?
[09:39] <PORDO> also, for some time now, pcmcia services fail on boot.  i don't need them presently, but i might soon.  what should i try to fix this?
[09:39] <reverseblade> rapid, I  am a big fan of linux and ubuntu, but I am a bit disappointed with the fact that my new computer sucks with linux out of  box :(
[09:39] <PORDO> i think i might have removed some package.
[09:39] <frogzoo> fallingdutch: I doubt an x crash could be related to bash, a text utility
[09:39] <rapid> reverseblade, thats the whole fun of linux, getting everything to work
[09:39] <AlphaN3> paloyme: cd /
[09:39] <rapid> lol!
[09:39] <paloyme> for example... i want to sudoedit a file thats in the root directory, how do i type this in terminal?
[09:40] <Jeffm515> ... it's true.
[09:40] <Jeffm515> :)
[09:40] <rapid> paloyme, you haven't manned sudo  have you
[09:40] <paolo> owh, your idea is good: i have to configure kdm, right?
[09:40] <AlphaN3> paloyme: sudo vi /blah (replace vi with an editor of your choice)
[09:40] <paloyme> got it alphan, thenks
[09:40] <AlphaN3> np
[09:40] <fallingdutch> frogzoo, well to be more precise: the session didn't came up and the message your session took less than 10 secs came up and stated an error in /etc/bash_completion
[09:41] <reverseblade> rapid, as I told, I am an experienced user. I also have an HP nx7010 machine. And ubuntu recognizes every bit of hardware of it. it works perfect with ubuntu out of box. So I was illusionized with this thing that I though linux works good with most of the hardware esp. if they were new. Obviously I was wrong
[09:41] <paloyme> uhmm... is blah an actual command or just an example?
[09:41] <rapid> lol
[09:41] <rapid> HAHA
[09:42] <AlphaN3> example, of course (:
[09:42] <AlphaN3> i mean, c'mon.. :D
[09:42] <rapid> quote of the year from paloyme
[09:42] <paloyme> oh good... i was worried there for a minute heheehe
[09:42] <Jeffm515> I had onboard sound on a tower, that I've never been able to find the windows drivers for... ubuntu found it outta the box.
[09:42] <AlphaN3> but linux is full of strangely-named programs.. well :P
[09:42] <frogzoo> reverseblade: obviously if h/w is brand new, the devs haven't had access to it yet ;)
[09:42] <owh> paolo: http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-kiosk&m=111945708505592&w=2 and http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-kiosk&m=111946860825069&w=2 give some indication on how this might work. I googled for force kdm sessions
[09:42] <paloyme> yep, you cant blame me for acting kind of noobie-ish....
[09:43] <paolo> may thanks owh, let's have a look
[09:43] <ski-worklap> hmm
[09:43] <reverseblade> frogzoo, true. I am just sad emotionally , that's it
[09:43] <AlphaN3> don't worry, we have all been there
[09:43] <rapid> paloyme: sorry dude, but I don't see how you could interpert blah as a command
[09:43] <paloyme> heheheheh thanks alphan
[09:43] <paloyme> har har har
[09:43] <malt> yo is there anyway to not allow a user to get ssh access when i create them a account on my linux box?
[09:43] <fallingdutch> are there any known problems with /etc/bash_completion ?
[09:43] <frogzoo> reverseblade: just give it a few months
[09:43] <owh> paloyme: I asked before, what are you trying to do?
[09:44] <frogzoo> fallingdutch: if you can get to a terminal, take a look at what's in /var/log/messages - sounds like your machine is badly sick
[09:44] <paloyme> just trying to edit my cupsd.conf file, it stopped giving me acces to the web interface, and i cant remember the directory names, but i do remember their position hehehe
[10:03] (neopsych1/#ubuntu) any ideas kuto?
[10:03] (paloyme/#ubuntu) it was working 2 hours ago, but after i checked one of the settings, i cant access it nemore
[10:03] (owh/#ubuntu) paloyme: And what did you respond with. The fact that you see the home page indicates that it's listening. The fact that you cannot do anything is likely a permission problem.
[10:03] (kuto/#ubuntu) neopsych1: ok i upload it to my ftp
[10:04] (owh/#ubuntu) paloyme: Did you *quit* your web-browser?
[10:04] (neopsych1/#ubuntu) There must be a way to resume downloads if googles video player can do it.
[10:04] (paloyme/#ubuntu) what do you mean, quit?
[10:05] <paolo> owh, i really can't find it: it seems kdmrc, isn't it?

[10:05] <paloyme> i didnt think i closed my web browser.... it just became inaccesible after i checked one of the sttings and i clicked on one of the addresses

[10:06] <ndlovu> when I look at text on websites, I see a lot of squares with 4 numbers in them. Is this something to do with the character formatting - UTF or whatever it is?
[10:06] <ColonelZarkawi> ski-worklap, maybe as last resource you could download java 6 which was released this week and try with the new plugin version?

[10:10] <neopsych1> it says it allows you to "download videos"
[10:10] <neopsych1> but does it really do this?
[10:10] <neopsych1> or does it just cache the videos in some proprietary format on your pc?
[10:10] <neopsych1> also.. it says googles video player can resume downloads
[10:10] <neopsych1> if this is so.. how are they preventing resume function when i try to download the file with download manager?

[10:27] <arrenlex> J-_: Whether it can or cannot, I do not know. However, you can MAKE it do so using "for a in `ls` ; do lame $a ; done"
[10:28] <tonyyarusso> RMorris85: right-click, add to panel
[10:28] <frogzoo> ok, looks like font paths changed for edgy
[10:28] <quacklin> :-) I would like to keep dapper but have the latest package without using tar.gz ... shouldn't backport do this? I can see the package version in package search is the one I want, but did not upgrade with apt-get update/upgrade on deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse? what is the purpose of this repository?
[10:28] <RMorris85> tonyyarusso: then add what?
[10:29] <tonyyarusso> RMorris85: Network Monitor I think it's called
[10:29] <tonyyarusso> RMorris85: Unless you meant network-manager-gnome, which is something different.
[10:29] <gotit> is there any command for activating screen saver
[10:29] <RMorris85> thats not the one i had... this one i could click and it would show the wireless networks around and i could connect
[10:31] <krampo> EHLO
[10:31] <gotit> how do i install my *.tar.gz theme file
[10:31] <RMorris85> tonyyarusso: is that the one im talking about?
[10:31] <tonyyarusso> RMorris85: Probably the second then, yes.
[10:31] <RMorris85> how do i add that one?
[10:32] <tonyyarusso> RMorris85: nm-applet and some switches I believe - see if it's in your Gnome Session preferences (System > Preferences > Sessions > Startup)

[10:39] <flasher222> but it looks simple

[10:46] <yoshig3> Or do I have to live with crap ones?
[10:46] <yoshig3> somerville32: what do you mean?
[10:47] <drayen> legsy: use the command prompt (terminal) and launch "sudo nm-applet"
[10:47] <somerville32> yoshig3, You don't need wine to run steam
[10:47] <yoshig3> somerville32: really? but how do I install it? I wanna play CS 1.6. That's it, I don't care about the other games.
[10:48] <jhaig> In the terminal, is it possible to get a 'visual bell'
[10:48] <somerville32> yoshig3, Install the steam engine and copy over the file from your cs install
[10:48] <somerville32> yoshig3, I'm sure you can find a tutorial with google
[10:49] <jhaig> Hmmm, if I wanted to get an upside-down '?' deliberately I wouldn't know how to do it.  :-)
[10:49] <yoshig3> somerville32: I did but it says use wine.

[10:58] <echosystm> and run
[10:58] <echosystm> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:58] <Jeffm515> I can use vi..
[10:58] <echosystm> it will take you through it step by step setting up a new config
[10:58] <stephan21> Jeffm515, /etc/xorg.conf
[10:58] <Jeffm515> that's not a problem, I just don't know where this stuff is yet

[11:19] <twosouls82> Assen, Drenthe, on the left of you

[11:22] <frogzoo> daya: you could try xmessage - not sure what it does, might be what you want
[11:22] <BjoeHrn> twosouls82, hm any ideas for my problem? I use dapper. And I try "apt-get install libcairo2" and it tells me that i need a newer version of  libfreetype6 (>= 2.2) but on my system is only the 2.1 version avaible
[11:23] <rapid> BjoeHrn, get libfreetype6 v2.2 or newer
[11:23] <serge_> Wiseguy: Ah ok, if i remember correctly there was a free cli rar version.
[11:23] <twosouls82> BjoeHrn: wait a sec
[11:23] <uMISTA> ok im trying to install xlibmesa-glu-dev but get a error Package xlibmesa-glu-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[11:23] <uMISTA> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[11:23] <uMISTA> is only available from another source
[11:23] <uMISTA> However the following packages replace it:
[11:23] <uMISTA>   x11proto-gl-dev
[11:23] <uMISTA> E: Package xlibmesa-glu-dev has no installation candidate
[11:23] <uMISTA> so should i install the x11proto-gl-dev?
[11:23] <rapid> dont do that
[11:23] <serge_> Wiseguy: but i guess you want the GUI version
[11:24] <BjoeHrn> rapid, sure but then i have to compile it on my own there is no dapper paket
[11:24] <daya> rapid, I don't get you, what /deyx destination or what
[11:24] <Wiseguy> serge_, i dont NEED it :P its just nice to have everything at a point and click away
[11:24] <rapid> daya: press w, see what tty or pts/ the user is on the use "echo /dev/pts/4 >> your message here"
[11:25] <twosouls82> BjoeHrn: I guess the "don't" wasn't meant for you ")
[11:25] <rapid> daya: /dev/pts/4 is probably the first ssh connection, if its a local user they will be on a /dev/tty1,2,3
[11:26] <serge_> Wiseguy: hmm true, well then your stick with the shareware version :)
[11:27] <twosouls82> BjoeHrn: that package might be here; "deb-src http://ubuntu.compiz.net/ dapper main" add it to the sources.list file

[11:28] <uMISTA> i trying to install wine with opengl, i need to install this?
[11:28] <uMISTA> sudo apt-get install xlibmesa-glu-dev
[11:28] <uMISTA> but it comes with up error about not there
[11:29] <frogzoo> uMISTA: why not just install from the budgetdedicated repo?
[11:29] <uMISTA> ?
[11:29] <uMISTA> wht thats?
[11:29] <frogzoo> uMISTA: for the 2nd time...
[11:29] <frogzoo> !wine | uMISTA
[11:29] <ubotu> uMISTA: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[11:29] <rapid> Tmob: what about a depmod -a
[11:30] <dreamer> frogzoo:sorry, but I don't know what to do with those pages~
[11:30] <uMISTA> io know about wine and thats wht i trying to install
[11:30] <uMISTA> but im trying to get opengl installed with it
[11:30] <frogzoo> dreamer: you read them
[11:30] <dreamer> I have
[11:30] <dreamer> but I don't know what has to do with my problem
[11:30] <uMISTA> i need to install xlibmesa-glu-dev
[11:30] <uMISTA> but cant
[11:31] <dreamer> I find it peculiar that the middle-mouse as scroll does work in thunderbird
[11:31] <sergevn> uMISTA: Enable multiverse repos.
[11:31] <dreamer> and with scroll I mean: press and scroll
[11:31] <dreamer> not roll and scroll
[11:31] <dreamer> like: it's more of a dynamic scroll-function
[11:31] <uMISTA> sorry how?
[11:31] <frogzoo> dreamer: change your /etc/X11/xorg.conf so it looks like the docs, from "This is what the relevant portion of my xorg.conf file looks like:"
[11:32] <cvrse> anyone know of a program to cut commercials from a dvb capture?
[11:32] <dreamer> frogzoo: why 7 buttons ?
[11:32] <dreamer> H have only 3
[11:32] <sergevn> uMISTA: edit as root /etc/apt/sources.list , then uncomment the multi/uni-verse lines. save the file and do as root "apt-get update"
[11:32] <frogzoo> dreamer: scroll button counts as 3
[11:33] <dreamer> ok: up/down/push ?
[11:33] <daya> rapid, I mean how to broadcast one message so that all users in the network will see it?
[11:33] <dreamer> so then it should be 5 ?
[11:33] <daya> rapid, I mean I want to broadcast the message in the linux
[11:34] <daya> rapid, in the network
[11:34] <rapid> daya: Hmm.. don't know.. I'd say theres some software. I only ever used that method :)
[11:35] <Joelio> Got segfaults with Evolution on edgy.. what's the deal.. looks like something to do with caem
[11:35] <Joelio> camel
[11:35] <Joelio> more importantly, what's the fix?
[11:36] <flasher222> how can i tell whether my soundcard has a hardware MIDI synthesizer?
[11:36] <daya> rapid, ok yar, what are these
[11:36] <rapid> daya: I tried googleing for you and found this http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7066 which I found interesting although its got nothing to do with what youi want
[11:37] <rapid> daya: or you could try, "man wall"
[11:38] <Joelio> Is there an Evolution issue guys?
=== Raphael_ is now known as _raphael_
[11:39] <Joelio> I'm on edgy, have done nothing, but it keeps segfaulting
[11:39] <lepirlouit> join #nux
[11:39] <rapid> no
[11:39] <rapid> you stay there.
[11:39] <twosouls82> BjoeHrn: can't find the package, though it should be in the compiz repo, since it is a dependency of that too
[11:41] <BjoeHrn> twosouls82, this could be - i'm remove xgl and beryl at the moment ;) It's only a toy ;)
[11:41] <RichEd> Hey guys ... Any idea why my mplayer display goes dim after playing a couple of movies, and then eventually black (with sound playing). I'm trying to find a workaround that aviods a reboot.
[11:41] <daya> rapid, I mean what we use as "net use"
[11:41] <daya> rapid, or net send
[11:41] <rapid> daya, did you man wall?
[11:42] <twosouls82> BjoeHrn: you only need the compiz repo for the package, not for toying, toying with Beryl is better
[11:42] <twosouls82> s/for/from/
[11:43] <Joelio> IS THERE AN EVOLUTION ISSUE IN EDGY?
[11:43] <twosouls82> caps?
[11:43] <BjoeHrn> twosouls82, yes ;) but i removed it now
[11:43] <twosouls82> BjoeHrn: good :P
[11:44] <foxpaul> hi all - i've got a problem when mounting a hard disk, i get I/O Error DriveReady SeekComplete Error & UncorrectableError - can i fix it somehow?

[11:45] <daya> rapid, yes but i don't get what i want
[11:45] <dreamer> frogzoo: with your suggestion X failed to load, I had to reconfigure and reboot
[11:45] <daya> rapid, it doesn't pop up the message in the remote clietns
[11:45] <foxpaul> ruxpin, can i not fsck the disk and mount it to get stuff off it?
[11:46] <daya> rapid, any idea
[11:46] <ruxpin> foxpaul: after you've got everything you can recover, mount the drive as readonly and do e2fsck (for ext3) - see man e2fsck and the ubuntu forums. there are many pages that help you out
[11:46] <rapid> daya: how are the remote clients connected?
[11:46] <rapid> what protocol or whatever the heck
[11:46] <foxpaul> ruxpin, thanks
[11:47] <daya> rapid, in the network I mean to broadcast

[11:49] <foxpaul> ruxpin, do you know how i can mount the disk as read-only?
[11:49] <rapid> daya i'm confused, who / what are you broadcasting to ? and how are they connected to the server.
[11:49] <rapid> Wiseguy, xawtv I think works

[11:52] <umop> how do i restart my mouse?  I have a KVM switch and i lose the mouse if i shutdown a computer with kvm focus
[11:52] <rapid> umop, try "gpm"
[11:52] <frogzoo> daya: did you even look at linpopup?
[11:52] <rapid> daya: I'm not sure..
[11:53] <daya> frogzoo, what is that?
[11:53] <umop> rapid, Can't find that command
[11:53] <rapid> umop: restart your X server?
[11:54] <klotho> so I'm trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on an IBM T23, and it keeps freezing during the install
[11:54] <klotho> is there a way to do text mode install? I can't see one.
[11:54] <frogzoo> daya: google would answer that question
[11:54] <umop> rapid, that doesnt work either :(.  the only way it comes back is if I boot another computer and wait for it to load the mouse, and then switch
[11:54] <stiffme1983> klotho: you have to use an alternate CD rather than liveCD
[11:54] <klotho> oh
[11:54] <klotho> is this a known problem with live cd?
[11:55] <klotho> it doesn't freeze, but the install stops responding after a few screens.
[11:55] <stiffme1983> klotho: i dont know, but you can also perform net install
[11:55] <frogzoo> klotho: which distro?
[11:55] <klotho> 6.10
[11:55] <stiffme1983> frogzoo: edgy
[11:55] <klotho> desktop
[11:55] <twosouls82> klotho: what processor and mem?
[11:55] <frogzoo> the edgy install can be used as a live cd

[11:56] <klotho> is that enough ram?
[11:56] <stiffme1983> how to stop power saving in console mode?
[11:56] <frogzoo> klotho: it's enough as long as you're not expecting anything flash
[11:57] <umop> rapid, im not sure how the mouse is 'mounted' or whatever..maybe i could try re doing that?
[11:57] <podr0znik> Is there maybe sb from Poland here?
[11:57] <klotho> how much does it really need?
[11:57] <daya> frogzoo, o.k
[11:57] <frogzoo> stiffme1983: probly 'sudo /etc/init.d/acpi-support stop
[11:57] <rapid> umop: not sure, my distribution slackware uses gpm, try find what ubuntu uses for the mouse
[11:57] <rapid> umop: kill the service and restart it

[11:57] <rapid> daya: np, sorry couldn't help anymore
[11:57] <daya> frogzoo, thanks
[11:58] <libre> can anyone help me a bit with Amarok ? im trying to play some mp3 files and it says that the gst-engine dosnt support mp3 files
[11:58] <rapid> amarok is cool
[11:58] <podr0znik> I need to know if ubuntu can handle Polish characters properly
[11:58] <rapid> I don't know about that error.
[11:58] <umop> songbird is cool :)
[11:58] <stiffme1983> libre: maybe you need a library for xine to play mp3
[11:58] <klotho> which iso should I get to do a text install of desktop on my IBM T23?
[11:58] <twosouls82> klotho: should do, propably another hardware problem, tried switching VCs on hangup?
[11:58] <rapid> does amarok use xine to play files?
[11:58] <stiffme1983> klotho: alternate cd for x86
[11:59] <klotho> what are vcs?
[11:59] <stiffme1983> rapid: i think so
[11:59] <rapid> stiffme1983, thats strange.. no that i know of.
[11:59] <twosouls82> I never use the LiveCD btw
[11:59] <klotho> ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso ?
[11:59] <arfonzo> hi, i've just installed edgy, and vmware doesn't start anymore, does anyone know why it might be happening? it worked fine in dapper
[11:59] <twosouls82> yeah the alternate is good
[11:59] <stiffme1983> klotho: yes
[11:59] <klotho> or ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso ?
[11:59] <stiffme1983> klotho: desktop is a liveCD
[12:00] <stiffme1983> klotho: use alternate cd to perform install in text mode
[12:00] <frogzoo> rapid: you have a choice of xine or gstreamer as the engine, xine is best
[12:00] <daya> rapid, its all right
[12:00] <twosouls82> klotho: desktop = live + installable --> alternate = 'proper' installer
[12:00] <klotho> okay. I must say that this live CD is live in the sense that a slow loris is live... at least with my slow CD drive

[12:13] <klotho> when I do a text mode install with the alternate CD, is there an easy way to get all the desktop stuff to be configured and installed?
[12:13] <rapid> reverseblade, once its done, split the file before burning
[12:13] <stiffme1983> klotho: it can install ubuntu desktop environment in textmode
[12:13] <nothlit> if you do the default install with the alternate disc, it ends up the same as the livecd
[12:14] <klotho> ok, cool
[12:14] <mrstocks> Hello i have some trouble with ly keyboard using linux, like in Vim whenever i press up / down ect i get a B or a C on a new line
[12:14] <mrstocks> anyidea ?
[12:14] <frogzoo> klotho: the text install when it runs to completion install a gui/desktop
[12:14] <nothlit> frogzoo, theres a miminal install too btw
[12:14] <stiffme1983> klotho: although it is in text mode ,it's still very easy to install it
[12:14] <rapid> mrstocks, press I maybe
[12:14] <reverseblade> rapid, that's what in my head. But since I will write a crontab for this, I want to keep it as simple as possible. So having a 2GB tar archive, I am curious if splitting is compulsory or not.
[12:14] <frogzoo> nothlit: the server install ?
[12:14] <mrstocks> rapid for insert ?
[12:14] <klotho> I see no process in the list which corresponds to what is specified in the properties for the installer
[12:14] <rapid> mrstocks, yeah.
[12:14] <klotho> and when I killed gconfd it didn't kill it
[12:14] <uMISTA> have a look people
[12:15] <mrstocks> rapid; no i guess to go up in the file.
[12:15] <uMISTA> http://www.google.co.nz/
[12:15] <uMISTA> new picture
[12:15] <jhaig> mrstocks: Do you have "vi compatibility" set?
[12:15] <rapid> mrstocks, if your just viewing use less
[12:15] <rapid> ...
[12:15] <nothlit> frogzoo, no on the alternate disc
[12:15] <rapid> reverseblade, probably not.
[12:15] <mrstocks> rapid, no, i edit files not just read, jhaig i will check.
[12:15] <stiffme1983> .........
[12:15] <mrstocks> nothlit nope it isn't set
[12:16] <mrstocks> what in the value / argument ?
[12:16] <jhaig> mrstocks: ... because it sounds like what happens sometimes with vi on Solaris.
[12:16] <echosystm> anyone know how to get xfce4 non-beta? (ie. non 4.4)
[12:16] <echosystm> is it in the repositories at all?
[12:16] <echosystm> apt-get install xfce4 installs beta 2 :(
[12:16] <reverseblade> rapid, what do you recommend, should I split it or not ?
[12:17] <nothlit> !info xfce4
[12:17] <ubotu> xfce4: meta-package for xfce4 dependencies. In component universe, is optional. Version 4.3.90.2 (edgy), package size 4 kB, installed size 48 kB
[12:17] <rapid> reverseblade, its quite easy to split it then put it back together. if the documentation says to do so, then you probably should.
[12:17] <nothlit> i don't see 4.4
[12:18] <sushi_> whats the apt command to install the meta-package?
[12:18] <frogzoo> nothlit: I see, thx
[12:19] <pitti> divansantana: hi
[12:19] <KenSentMe> Is it possible to remove all packages from a certain repo?
[12:19] <Kyral> sushi_: The same as normal packages
[12:19] <divansantana> pretty please can someone tell me how to rebuild a deb file(from source?) with addiotnal configuration options
[12:19] <klotho> so far I'm not very happy with ubuntu
[12:19] <echosystm> nothlit
[12:19] <pitti> divansantana: there shuold be enough docs on the wiki, but it boils down to 'apt-get source package -- edit configure params debian/rules -- debuild -us -uc -b'
[12:19] <klotho> the install locks up and can't be terminated, apparently
[12:20] <nothlit> klotho, use the other disc then
[12:20] <echosystm> apparently 4.3.90.2 is 4.4 beta 2
[12:20] <klotho> why not name the install process "install" so you can at least kill it?
[12:20] <echosystm> hmm
[12:20] <echosystm> actually
[12:20] <divansantana> pitti: I have seached docs and wiki
[12:20] <stiffme1983> you can kill the process immediately using 9
[12:20] <echosystm> i have 4.3.99.1 !
[12:20] <klotho> right, but WHICH process?
[12:20] <divansantana> pitti: I have done apt-get source squid
[12:20] <echosystm> which is 4.4 beta 2
[12:20] <klotho> I tried killing several that looked likely and the stupid time zone set thing stayed hanging on the screen
[12:20] <divansantana> pitti: and did a ./configure --myoptions
[12:21] <nothlit> echosystm, check your /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:21] <klotho> and restarting install did nothing because there was already an instance running, probably
[12:21] <echosystm> regardless, 4.2.3.2 is the stable version
[12:21] <nothlit> echosystm, are you running feisty or something?
[12:21] <echosystm> nope
[12:21] <echosystm> 6.10
[12:21] <jhaig> klotho: How much memory does your machine have?
[12:21] <divansantana> pitti: and then did a debuild -us -uc -b
[12:21] <klotho> 256K
[12:21] <klotho> sorry
[12:21] <klotho> 256M
[12:21] <divansantana> what do i do in debian/rules though?
[12:21] <nothlit> echosystm, then why do you have 4.3.99.1
[12:21] <ski-worklap> what's the eta on feisty?
[12:21] <klotho> although 256K used to be enough to run unix!
[12:21] <echosystm> i have no idea
[12:21] <nothlit> echosystm, thats not whats in the repos
[12:21] <echosystm> maybe because im not running xubuntu?
[12:22] <echosystm> ive got ubuntu
[12:22] <echosystm> with universe + multiverse enabled or whatever
[12:22] <nothlit> echosystm, i have plain ubuntu too
[12:22] <echosystm> i just did apt-get isntall xfce4
[12:22] <nothlit> klotho, a livecd takes more
[12:22] <nothlit> klotho, you should be fine with the alternate install
[12:22] <klotho> nothlit: how about actually running it?
[12:22] <echosystm> maybe that little irc plugin is out dated?
[12:22] <tonyyarusso> ski-worklap: Late April 2007
[12:23] <nothlit> klotho, it might be possible, if not you can use xubuntu
[12:23] <tonyyarusso> !feisty | ski-worklap
[12:23] <ubotu> ski-worklap: The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is pre-alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule - Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty - Help in #ubuntu+1
[12:23] <nothlit> echosystm, no i checked my apt-cache, the bot was just for your info
[12:23] <pitti> divansantana: that won't help you, debuild cleans the source and thus the ./configure efects
[12:23] <jhaig> I ask because I found that the install freezes if you have only 128M of memory and no swap space.
[12:23] <echosystm> what would explain me getting this package then? :P
[12:23] <ski-worklap> tonyyarusso, thx
[12:23] <echosystm> i dont even know how to download packages
[12:23] <pitti> divansantana: you need to set the configure options in debian/rules, or you can try with ./configure --foo and debuild -us -uc -b -nc
[12:23] <echosystm> haha
[12:23] <pitti> divansantana: the '-nc' means 'no clean'
[12:23] <nothlit> echosystm, cat /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:24] <nothlit> !pastebin | echosystm

[12:24] <klotho> where are the system requirements? I don't see them on the ubuntu.com page describing the product.
[12:25] <susscorfa> they are not that high
[12:25] <divansantana> pitti: O, I think a light bulb just went on!!!
[12:25] <klotho> they should be there, really obviously highlighted so you can decide if you need xubuntu
[12:25] <divansantana> pitti: AWESOME! I think I understand, let me give it a try quickQ
[12:25] <echosystm> how do i copy xterm output?

[12:26] <RobO> hello all i am looking for a good blog editing app for dapper... something that is like blogjet or bloggar
[12:26] <jhaig> nothlit: That must be out of date.  The release notes for 6.06 says 256Mb.
[12:27] <nothlit> !blogtk
[12:27] <ubotu> blogtk: GTK Weblogging client. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.1-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 71 kB, installed size 572 kB
[12:27] <nothlit> jhaig, oh
[12:27] <klotho> jhaig: what's the link for that? and is 256M enough or should I really be using xubuntu?
[12:27] <RobO> that is a crappy app
[12:27] <sephirot1> Hi, can anyone suggest which java pkg to install- i am talking about the development-kit- would you recommend the blackdown java or sun-java?
[12:27] <nothlit> !drivel
[12:27] <ubotu> drivel: Blogging client for the GNOME desktop. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0.3-2ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 399 kB, installed size 1696 kB
[12:27] <echosystm> i get an error
[12:27] <sephirot1> is there any difference to begin with?
[12:27] <echosystm> i think pastebin isnt working?
[12:27] <echosystm> query failure
[12:28] <jhaig> <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/releasenotes/606>
[12:28] <reverseblade> sephirot1, the JDK is in the repos (v 1.5)
[12:28] <KenSentMe> echosystm:  use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:28] <reverseblade> sephirot1, go with sun java
[12:28] <nothlit> echosystm, use pastebin.ca
[12:28] <Beta_M> i can't find torrent download option on the website
[12:28] <RobO> ne thing that has some real features?? i have tried drivel, blogtk, and just about all of the linux ported apps they dont have any real features
[12:28] <nothlit> Beta_M, go to additional methods
[12:28] <nothlit> Beta_M, then look through the file list for torrents
[12:28] <sephirot1> /quit
[12:29] <echosystm> http://pastebin.ca/276484
[12:30] <klotho> so is 256M really usable or will it always be thrashing?
[12:30] <echosystm> i just enabled everything
[12:30] <RobO> i guess not huh??/
[12:31] <nothlit> echosystm, apt-cache show xfce4
[12:31] <nothlit>  echosystm oh, you know what, its because you enabled backports
[12:31] <echosystm> oh
[12:31] <echosystm> :P
[12:31] <echosystm> thats bad?
[12:31] <nothlit> no
[12:31] <nothlit> but its beta
[12:31] <echosystm> ah
[12:32] <echosystm> no wonder everything has been screwing up on me
[12:32] <echosystm> haha
[12:32] <nothlit> and not with security updates
[12:32] <echosystm> rightyo
[12:32] <echosystm> so
[12:32] <echosystm> seing as the standard repo for xfce 4 is still not a stable release
[12:32] <echosystm> how do i go about getting the stable version?
[12:32] <klotho> anyone have a considered opinion on whether with 256M I should be using xubuntu?
[12:32] <nothlit> no the regular repo is stable
[12:33] <echosystm> but it isnt the right version?
[12:33] <jhaig> klotho: I'm not sure - I'm not really too familar with ubuntu myself, but xubuntu would probably be a safer bet.
[12:33] <klotho> what do I lose by using xubuntu?
[12:33] <jhaig> You can convert it into standard ubuntu by installing the desktop-ubuntu package, I think.
[12:33] <echosystm> 4.2.3.2 is the stable version
[12:33] <nothlit> echosystm, downgrading manually would be annoying, easiest way would be to disable backports and removing and reinstalling xfce (after sudo aptitude update of course)
[12:33] <echosystm> the package you said earlier was different
=== Achilles is now known as ajayc
[12:34] <jhaig> klotho: I think it doesn't intall open office, and some of the gnome stuff is replaced with more light weight alternatives.
[12:34] <echosystm> afaik 4.3.X.X were release candidates
[12:34] <jhaig> but you can install these afterwards if you need.
[12:35] <klotho> jhaig: anything that won't work on xubuntu?
[12:35] <klotho> like any apps, etc.?
[12:35] <xander> helllooooooooooo
[12:35] <nick4> I just installed 6.10 and I would like the 6.06 bash colors. How can I do that?
[12:35] <jhaig> Everything should work, but the desktop integration might be different.
[12:35] <nothlit> echosystm, then you could compile it yourself
[12:36] <nothlit> klotho, xubuntu is gtk based, everything that you run in gnome should be able to work with xubuntu
[12:36] <jhaig> but when you have a swap partition, it will probably be possible to convert xubuntu to ubuntu.
[12:36] <echosystm> 2006/07/10 - Xfce 4.4 beta 2 (4.3.90.2) released
[12:36] <echosystm> righto
[12:36] <echosystm> whats involved with that? :P
[12:36] <nothlit> klotho, it basically is a more lightweight de, and comes with a more lightweight suite of apps
[12:36] <nothlit> echosystm, then you could compile it yourself
[12:37] <klotho> it's just the gtk that makes the memory requirement lower?
[12:37] <echosystm> yeah
[12:37] <echosystm> ive never compiled anything before
[12:37] <echosystm> what does it involve?
[12:37] <nothlit> echosystm, you have to remember though, that ubuntu would have fixed up the app
[12:37] <nothlit> !compile | echosystem
[12:37] <ubotu> echosystem: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[12:37] <echosystm> ok sounds nasty
[12:38] <echosystm> i'll stick with the beta
[12:38] <echosystm> haha
[12:38] <echosystm> :D
[12:38] <nothlit> klotho, no, just the way it operates and the apps it includes
[12:38] <nothlit> klotho, gnome uses gtk as well
[12:38] <echosystm> thanks for your help nothlit
[12:38] <echosystm> really appreciated
[12:38] <klotho> it actually uses xfce
[12:38] <klotho> apparently
[12:39] <nothlit> yes
[12:39] <nothlit> it does
[12:39] <jhaig> I think xfce and gnome are both built on top of gtk
[12:39] <nothlit> thats correct
[12:39] <jhaig> but gnome is built with more bells and whistles
[12:39] <spx2> how do i figgure out my LCD refresh rate ?
[12:40] <spx2> i  know what my laptop is
[12:40] <nothlit> klotho, you can still install any gnome apps you may miss
[12:40] <spx2> but i can't find in the pdf's refresh rate vertical and horizontal
[12:40] <klotho> how easy is it to switch from gnome to xfce if I need to conserve memory?
[12:40] <nothlit> klotho, just log out, choose one of them in sessions, and log in
[12:40] <spx2> klotho: do a  ctrl+alt+backspace
[12:40] <klotho> so xfce comes with the regular ubuntu too?
[12:41] <nothlit> if you start from xubuntu, install ubuntu-desktop, and if you start with ubuntu, install xubuntu-desktop
[12:41] <echosystm> no
[12:41] <spx2> klotho: sudo apt-get install xfce
[12:41] <nothlit> klos_, no
[12:41] <echosystm> you have to download it
[12:41] <klotho> ah okay, cool
[12:41] <twosouls82> how do I unsit a .sit file?
[12:41] <echosystm> i wouldnt install all the bells and whistles of any of the distros though klotho
[12:41] <spx2> (01:40:05 PM) spx2: how do i figgure out my LCD refresh rate ?
[12:41] <spx2> (01:40:11 PM) spx2: i  know what my laptop is
[12:41] <spx2> (01:40:22 PM) spx2: but i can't find in the pdf's refresh rate vertical and horizontal
[12:41] <echosystm> get the buntu alternate cd
[12:41] <klotho> so maybe I'll install the regular one and then get xfce if I am low on ram
[12:41] <echosystm> and install the things you need only
[12:41] <echosystm> thats what i have done
[12:41] <QwertyM> st00pid DNS
[12:42] <echosystm> theres way too much crap in ubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop
=== Fredle is now known as fredle
[12:42] <klotho> like what, echosystm?
[12:42] <echosystm> all the programs you wont use
[12:42] <echosystm> like xine
[12:42] <nothlit> extra apps
[12:42] <echosystm> VLC > xine etc.
[12:42] <echosystm> install what you want
[12:42] <nothlit> ubuntu-desktop doesn't have xine
[12:42] <echosystm> it will be a pit of a pain
[12:42] <echosystm> but its worth it
[12:42] <klotho> what's xine?
[12:42] <twosouls82> xine is in kubuntu-desktop
[12:43] <twosouls82> !xine
[12:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xine - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:43] <spx2> klotho: use fluxbox
[12:43] <twosouls82> :\
[12:43] <echosystm> sorry gxine
[12:43] <nothlit> i thought kubuntu-desktop uses kaffeine
[12:43] <echosystm> comes with xubuntu
[12:43] <klotho> problem is, I've never used linux as a desktop before, so I don't know what apps I may need
[12:43] <twosouls82> i thought kubuntu-desktop uses kaffeine -> which is a frontend for the xine backend
[12:43] <echosystm> ok
[12:43] <nothlit> guys don't recommend non-de's to people new to linux
[12:43] <echosystm> this is what you want to do
[12:43] <echosystm> mmm
[12:43] <flasher222> how can i search my hard drive for all files with extension *.not?
[12:44] <higir> how do I access a WAP secured WIFI?
[12:44] <QwertyM> VLC 0.8.6 out yet ?
[12:44] <twosouls82> klotho: use aptitude/synaptic and query to find out
[12:44] <nothlit> twosouls82, oh, haven't used kde in years
[12:44] <klotho> ah, fluxbox is another window manager. what makes it better than xfcd?
[12:44] <echosystm> if youre new to linux i would just stick to xubuntu for now
[12:44] <tonyyarusso> flasher222: 'locate .not' would be one way
[12:44] <echosystm> but some time in the future
[12:44] <echosystm> you might want to look into a minimal install
[12:44] <twosouls82> nothlit: I am cheating now, I use it daily
[12:44] <yoshig3> later everyone
[12:44] <flasher222> tonyyarusso: thanks
[12:44] <klotho> twosouls82: what's aptitude?
[12:45] <echosystm> just so you know what you need: x-window-system-core xfce4 synaptic firefox vlc + any other pgorgams you need
[12:45] <echosystm> aptitude is a package manager/installer
[12:45] <nothlit> klotho, don't worry about it, those sorts of things require you to learn about mounting manually and idesk... just stick with xubuntu or ubuntu for now
[12:45] <echosystm> same as apt-get more or less
[12:45] <echosystm> it runs from command line
[12:45] <frogzoo> who or what is supposed to create /var/run/vde ? I've installed the vde package, but the directory's missing ?
[12:45] <twosouls82> klotho: a nice installer (for on the commandline), you will need to install it first (sudo apt-get install aptitude)
[12:45] <echosystm> synaptic is the same thing but with a gui
[12:45] <klotho> google's homepage banner right now is really silly
[12:45] <nothlit> APTITUDE is installed by default...
[12:45] <echosystm> xterm
[12:45] <echosystm> oops
[12:45] <echosystm> wrong keyboard :P
[12:46] <flasher222> tonyyarusso: does locate search through the entire hard drive? I can't seem to be able to find what i want
[12:46] <nothlit> besides for people new to linux gnome-app-install is sufficient for most of their needs
[12:46] <nothlit> flasher222, sudo updatedb
[12:46] <nothlit> flasher222, it searches through an index already created of your filesystem
[12:46] <echosystm> nothlit, x-window-system-core is sufficient to run xfce right?
[12:46] <echosystm> i dont need to install any gtk stuff or fonts etc. ?
[12:46] <nothlit> echosystm, should be
[12:47] <klotho> does wireless networking work by default or do I need to install something for using this in internet cafes, etc?
[12:47] <nothlit> echosystm, gimme a sec
[12:47] <echosystm> ok, thanks
[12:47] <echosystm> :)
[12:47] <tonyyarusso> flasher222: I believe it does.  Updates it's list on a daily basis, so new things won't show yet.

[12:48] <ubotu> klotho: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:48] <nothlit> echosystm, use xserver-xorg-core
[12:48] <klotho> why https?
[12:48] <echosystm> whats the difference?
[12:49] <twosouls82> dunno, I am not that server admin =)
[12:49] <nothlit> echosystm, the package you listed is a transitional package
[12:49] <echosystm> oh
[12:49] <echosystm> what does transitional mean?
[12:49] <echosystm> lol
[12:49] <nothlit> echosystm, it just depends on xorg, its empty
[12:49] <klotho> https wastes money if it's not needed
[12:49] <twosouls82> klotho: opensource ;)
[12:49] <nothlit> echosystm, if you want you can install the xorg metapackage, or xserver-xorg-core may be enough
[12:49] <flasher222> tonyyarusso: have u installed noteedit yet?
[12:49] <nothlit> echosystm, means it helps you transition from one system to another
[12:50] <twosouls82> klotho: thus free
[12:50] <J03> 'Lo All!
[12:50] <nothlit> echosystm, linux systems often change to new technologies, and thats what transitional packages are for
[12:50] <echosystm> ok, so the benefit of xserver-xorg-core is?
[12:50] <echosystm> ah
[12:50] <nothlit> afk
[12:50] <echosystm> i see
[12:50] <tonyyarusso> flasher222: Not tonight, no.  Later I'll check it out.
[12:50] <J03> I just installed xubuntu. 'Tis pretty sweet!
[12:50] <tonyyarusso> (after exams)
[12:50] <echosystm> so is there any problem with running x-window-manager-core ?
[12:50] <echosystm> or is this just a precaution
[12:50] <klotho> twosouls82: https causes encryption to happen. encryption costs CPU cycles. CPUs that are more utilized run hotter. Running hotter burns electricity. Therefore using https costs money.
[12:50] <Jaak_> Helo, how do i start/stop Deamons from loading on startup?
[12:51] <martianpenguin> Jaak_, /etc/init.d/
[12:51] <twosouls82> klotho: never compile yourself then :\
[12:51] <QwertyM> how do I install a google toolbar? :-s
[12:51] <J03> klotho, Lol :D
[12:51] <mneptok> Jaak_: update-rc.d

[12:52] <martianpenguin> Jaak_, use that update thing, it's cleaner that way
[12:52] <mneptok> klotho: your PSU scales power output based on board demand?
[12:52] <J03> Is 6.10 Server out yet?
[12:52] <Shoseki> join irc.quakenet.org
[12:52] <klotho> J03: it's true. compare your electricity bill when running normally to when running using seti@home, etc.
[12:52] <Shoseki> hmm that didn't work
[12:52] <J03> Ok :D I will!
[12:52] <klotho> the 'idle' cycles cost a lot less
[12:53] <tickeshe> how can i join other channels?

[12:53] <AzMoo> /j #channel
[12:53] <tickeshe> i cant see any channel names
[12:53] <tickeshe> where can i find it?
[12:54] <twosouls82> the way I am using my box, that little difference won't show proper on a bill I guess, if it is true that is
[12:54] <martianpenguin>  /list might work for you
[12:54] <AzMoo> tickeshe, what client are you using?
[12:54] <martianpenguin> idk if all clients support /list
[12:54] <klotho> twosouls82: the way I know this is, I like a quiet system. So I have a fan with a manual speed control and keep it turned down. I also have a temperature monitor.
[12:54] <Jaak_> thanks, marianp and mneptok
[12:54] <echosystm> nothlit, can you explain this package business please? everywhere i see people refferencing the x-window-manager-core package instead
[12:54] <klotho> running SETI@home the cpu temperature goes up over 20 degrees C
[12:55] <klotho> or when anything is at 100%
[12:55] <gnomefreak> only issue is /list may lock up your client
[12:55] <J03> How do i update from 6.06 to 6.10?
[12:55] <frogzoo> how is the varrun (/var/run) filesystem created ?
[12:55] <martianpenguin> gnomefreak, probably only on a server like this with so many channels

[01:27] <AzMoo> Rambo3, speaking of netbeans, is that in the official repositories?
[01:27] <ubox> does totem do it?
[01:27] <stiffme1983> tickeshe: apt-get install w32codecs
[01:27] <reverseblade> klotho, AFAIK KDEdevelop has no support for it. If you wanna go with java, I suggest netbeans, eclipse is ok. for ruby and javascript, I suggest vim ,with rails plugin. But still eclipse will do the job. Check out radrails.
[01:27] <reverseblade> *** Any one knows this: kernel: Disabling IRQ#7  ?
[01:27] <tickeshe> ok i'll try that now.. thanks stiffme
[01:27] <Rambo3> AzMoo, it should be part of SDK , andi dont think so

[01:28] <Rambo3> klos_, never used eclips for java only for flex2 , so i dont know

[01:30] <reverseblade> tickeshe, tar xzvf file name
[01:30] <klotho> I never got into VI. I prefer wysiwg editors really
[01:30] <wabbit> hi all I've upgraded my distribution from dapper to edgy. For some reason Linux 386 is used instead of Linux 686-smp even though I have linux-image-generic and grub installed. Any Ideas as to what is going wrong or how I might have to configure the grub loader?
[01:30] <ubox> -
[01:30] <tickeshe> that will just extract right?
[01:30] <ubox> no also untar it
[01:30] <reverseblade> tickeshe, or  simply go with nautilus and click on it. and yes
[01:31] <diskus> tickeshe: well tar.bz2 is just packed data
[01:31] <klotho> what's good about vi? It seems kind of ancient
[01:31] <reverseblade> klotho, if you will do rails development, forget about WYSIWYG. vim is much faster than anything
[01:31] <tickeshe> ok thanks.. i only know the .deb package... coz its easier..hehe
[01:31] <klotho> what makes it fast?
[01:31] <AzMoo> klotho, it's efficient.
[01:31] <ubox> i prefer emacs
[01:31] <wabbit> I've been looking around and other people seem to have the same trouble with 686-smp but I've not found a solution.
[01:31] <klotho> don't you have to keep switching modes? that always seemed annoying
[01:32] <diskus> tickeshe: usualy if software is in .tar.bz2 then it means you have to compile it
[01:32] <pty> gvim with the rails.vim plugin is unbeatable for rails dev
[01:33] <klotho> what makes it good?
[01:33] <reverseblade> klotho, firstly it has a special plugin with for rails. it enables you to quickly navigate between your models and controllers so on. Secondly since ruby is a dynamically typed language, intelli sense mambo jambo is useless for rails. Once you get used to vim (you should be able to use NORMAL MODE default) it will pay off .
[01:33] <wickedpuppy> klotho, vi is on every linux/unix box ... i think that alone makes it worth learning it well .. and my editor of choice is emacs :P
[01:33] <tickeshe> so i have to use the ./configure command?
[01:33] <ZeiP_> I have an Ubuntu computer with semi-working RAID. In a tutorial a raidhotadd-command is mentioned, however it is not on my system. Is it in a separate package, replaced with some other command or something else?
[01:33] <reverseblade> klotho, editing and typing is very fast with vim
[01:33] <beerockxs> wabbit: I had a similar problem with only the 386 kernel being loaded on my Athlon64 dual core, but I don't remember how I fixed it, sorry
[01:33] <reverseblade> klotho, even for programming
[01:33] <diskus> nowadays you can find something else besides vi too
[01:33] <pty> i'm sure emacs, once customised is as good as vim/rails.vim.  i'm just in the 'other camp' :P
[01:34] <klotho> right, it's good to know vi, but using it all the time seems annoying
[01:34] <AzMoo> wickedpuppy, not true! Gentoo doesn't install vim by default, it uses nano.
[01:34] <ubox> today is edvard munch's b-day
[01:34] <pty> klotho: there is a list of features here: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567
[01:34] <ubox> as suggested by google
[01:34] <klotho> ubox: and who cares?
[01:34] <ubox> just nice logo
[01:34] <beerockxs> wabbit: is the linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic package installed
[01:34] <wickedpuppy> AzMoo, gentoo doesn't do a lot by default ... actually nothing about gentoo is default ... lol
[01:34] <beerockxs> ?
[01:34] <ubox> on google
[01:34] <wabbit> beerockxs: checking
[01:34] <reverseblade> klotho, I was a long time VS 2005/2003 user , I used eclipse , I used netbeans. For rails development, vim is your best option once you get used to it.
[01:35] <AzMoo> wickedpuppy, hah.
[01:35] <wattage> is automatix dead?
[01:35] <reverseblade> klotho, some people argue textmate is also good
[01:35] <pty> to be honest, for a rails noob eclipse with radrails may be a decent option
[01:35] <wabbit> beerockxs: ues it is in it's newest version
[01:35] <reverseblade> pty,I would disagree but that's just me
[01:35] <hdibani> did somebody get smbldap-installer to work on edgy?
[01:35] <tonyyarusso> !automatix | wattage
[01:35] <ubotu> wattage: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[01:35] <diskus> for anything noob eclipse is not good option
[01:35] <wabbit> beerockxs: is the issue to do with grub in some way??

[01:37] <wabbit> beerockxs: no it's not installed
[01:37] <reverseblade> pty, I personally find eclipse a bit bloated. and since ruby do not require intellisense, radrails is not necessary. Besides it has no 1.0 version yet. it is something like 0.7.x
[01:37] <beerockxs> wabbit: then I have no idea, sorry.

[01:37] <klotho> I don't have a mac
[01:38] <wattage> what about easyubuntu
[01:38] <reverseblade> klotho, listen to my word , spend few hours may be a day for vim and rails vim plugin, and it will pay off
[01:38] <pty> reverseblade: yeah; bloatedness is the reason i don't use eclipse.  intellisense style suggestion is still quite useful though, I use the vim 7 one quite a bit
[01:38] <wattage> the thing is the damn pgp key is missing, :x
[01:38] <wattage> sudo apt-get install automatix2
[01:38] <wattage> crap wrong tab
[01:38] <klotho> reverseblade: does it show you the application's outline like eclipse does, or is it just a blank text screen that you have to remember the location of every buffer with, like emacs?

[01:39] <ailean> is there anything to let me log-in to my PC graphically from a remote location, even a windows machine?
[01:39] <pty> reverseblade: i disagree. but whatever works for you
[01:39] <reverseblade> klotho, you type \be, and vim7 lists all buffers so that you do not have to remember. Say you wanna open a model called product you type :Rmo<tab> pro<tab> and it opens the products model.
[01:40] <reverseblade> pty, people think different. That's a good thing.
[01:40] <cjones> wattage dont feel bad iam in the automatixd camp too
[01:41] <klotho> it would seem to be easier to click on it from a heirarchy tree, or a tab list at the top of the screen, no?
[01:41] <reverseblade> klotho, do not use vim in INSERT mode default. And do not use cursor keys at all
[01:41] <wattage> ah
[01:41] <klotho> reverseblade: how do you mean?
[01:42] <klotho> that's the annoying thing about vi. you have to go into insert mode to type, then get out of it to do a command, etc.
[01:42] <reverseblade> klotho, try it and see it yourself. I have given my advice.
[01:42] <engla> Why hasn't this been mentioned before. Ubuntu uses the same company as microsoft for icon design: http://iconfactory.com/design/index
[01:42] <reverseblade> klotho, I can code 3 times faster than you would do in eclipse
[01:43] <reverseblade> enough vim propaganda, lol
[01:43] <ailean> what's the problem with that engla?
[01:44] <dredhammer> hello has anyone been able to compile the latest svn mplayer with theora enabled?
[01:44] <pty> engla: apple use them too.  whats the problem?
[01:44] <engla> ailean: it's interesting. And until I saw that I was under the impressioni that the ubuntulooks icons was a community effort
[01:44] <engla> and it's interesting to see we're all in the same boat; Apple, Microsoft and Canonical
[01:45] <ailean> engla, i think it was, but sabdfl wasn't happy or something
[01:45] <engla> I know that the iconfactory guys are good :)
[01:45] <ailean> engla, so he used these guys
[01:45] <cjones> wattage there is an automatix for edgy if thats what your looking for
[01:45] <reverseblade> klotho, having that said, radrails is  not a bad option.
[01:45] <tonyyarusso> !automatix | cjones
[01:45] <ubotu> cjones: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[01:45] <ailean> beat me to it tonyyarusso :)
[01:45] <klotho> reverseblade: okay, thanks for those tips!
[01:46] <engla> sabdfl's judgement is flaky at times (Means I don't agree with him at all sometimes). I'd picked Tango for an icon scheme
[01:46] <ailean> engla, who are you going to agree with *all* the time? :)
[01:46] <cjones> tonyyarusso i know that
[01:46] <tonyyarusso> engla: You can chatter about icons and sabdfl in #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[01:46] <ailean> engla, end of the day, he's the boss and if people aren't happy with it then they should fork
[01:46] <dredhammer> but automatix makes it so easy to enbale wmv playback in totem
[01:47] <tonyyarusso> dredhammer: Only if your system boots afterwards.
[01:47] <engla> ailean: or install a new icon theme. Anyone following me to #-offtopic?
[01:47] <dredhammer> what i can't stand is all the other players it wants to install just to get libxine to replace gstream in totem
[01:48] <ailean> engla, nope, i have to go :)

[01:50] <jrib> Zaggynl: http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/MySQL_HowTo
[01:50] <Zaggynl> jrib, I'm reading that
[01:50] <wabbit> ok
[01:50] <beerockxs> wabbit: after that, it should show on the grub boot menu
[01:51] <Zaggynl> jrib, but I have to enter my root password, which I don't know ofcourse
[01:51] <engla> klotho: it can be a bad burn actually. Do you know for sure that the CD is good?
[01:51] <tonyyarusso> !root | Zaggynl
[01:51] <ubotu> Zaggynl: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[01:51] <klotho> it's sitting there with no disk activity for a while
[01:51] <jrib> Zaggynl: did you ever create one?
[01:51] <Zaggynl> jrib, not that I know
[01:51] <jrib> tonyyarusso: (for mysql)
[01:51] <jrib> Zaggynl: type     mysql -u root     can you login?
[01:52] <tonyyarusso> jrib: Does that work differently somehow?  (Not familiar with the particular app)
[01:52] <Zaggynl> jrib, when I do 'mysql -u root ' from the guide, I get a mysql prompt
[01:52] <Zaggynl> I don't really know what to do next
[01:52] <teza> hi do u guys help with Shell, etc. in here
[01:52] <klotho> so I should give up and start over? it doesn't tend to stop there for a long time with no disk activity, right?
[01:52] <tonyyarusso> teza: To some extent.  There's also #bash, which would be better for more in-depth questions in that regard.
[01:52] <jrib> Zaggynl: then that means you logged in.  root doesn't have a password.  You should probably set one like the guide urges you to
[01:53] <jrib> tonyyarusso: yeah, it's just the root user in mysql
[01:53] <Zaggynl> jrib, ah

[01:53] <tonyyarusso> jrib: What's the reason for wanting a root password for mysql when nothing else needs it?
[01:53] <wabbit> beerockxs: I'll restart and let you know how things went. Thanks!!
[01:53] <klotho> I checked the last CD for defects, but may have forgotten to check this one
[01:53] <engla> klotho: I'm far from an expert on this. But if nothing happens, abort it and check the CD (it has an integrity check somewhere). If there is no integrity failiure I'm puzzled
[01:53] <beerockxs> wabbit: you're welcome
[01:54] <jrib> tonyyarusso: so I don't come over your house, type   mysql -u root, and destroy your mysql database
[01:54] <tonyyarusso> jrib: Well, you'd need my user password presumably
[01:55] <tonyyarusso> jrib: if you had that you could delete the entire filesystem anyway
[01:55] <AzMoo> tonyyarusso, no, mysql's default root is empty.
[01:55] <AzMoo> eg, 'mysql -u root' will let you right in.
[01:55] <tonyyarusso> AzMoo: But you'd need to get on the system to start with
[01:56] <AzMoo> tonyyarusso, true.
[01:56] <jrib> tonyyarusso: I'm no mysql expert, but continuing to guess, maybe an application could try to login as root
[01:56] <tonyyarusso> jrib: perhaps
[01:56] <AzMoo> jrib, that's certainly possible.
[01:56] <tonyyarusso> I'll have to look into this some weekend
[01:56] <pinchartl> hi
[01:57] <tonyyarusso> jrib, AzMoo Is MySql root password == system root password or no?
[01:57] <jrib> tonyyarusso: nope, unrelated
[01:57] <tonyyarusso> jrib: Oh, okay then.
[01:59] <paolo> Hi: which is the config file which associates a default program to a file type in icewm? thnks....
[02:00] <Zaggynl> jrib, the guide doesn't say howto set the password
[02:01] <klotho> okay, so the CD-ROM tested as valid
[02:01] <klotho> so why would it hang at 85%?
[02:01] <ubox> Zaggynl: wht password?
[02:01] <klotho> my text install hung at "select and install software" 85% "Installed ubuntu-desktop"
[02:02] <klotho> any idea what I can do to get it to install?
[02:02] <jrib> Zaggynl: under "MySQL Setup".  The first command is "mysql -u root".  Then the following three commands to mysql sets the password.  In the exampole they give, you set the password to 'xxxxxxx'
[02:02] <Zaggynl> jrib, when I do that, I just get a mysql prompt
[02:02] <reverseblade> paolo, #icewm
[02:02] <yuv656> is there a way to measure bandwidth using shell commands?
[02:02] <jrib> Zaggynl: if you did all three commands, quit mysql, and try to log back in with root without providing a password
[02:03] <Zaggynl> retrying..
[02:03] <AzMoo> Zaggynl, mysqladmin -u root password <new-password>
[02:03] <Zaggynl> <3
[02:04] <klotho> no one has an idea? this isn't some strange system... it's a common one, IBM T23

[02:41] <Sebboh> I moved from ubuntu to kubuntu via apt-get of the meta package, and now my system boots to a console login prompt instead of kdm...  Where are my logs?  When I try sudo kdm, I get zero output...
[02:41] <Everflex> Is it a good idea to use Trevios sources.list from http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/blog/lista-repository-sourceslist-ottimizzata-per-ubuntu-kubuntu-linux/ ?
[02:41] <BjoeHrn> re
[02:41] <BjoeHrn> twosouls82, :)
[02:41] <pinchartl> so I'm left with a base ubuntu system, and I have to recompile most packages manually. I could as well go for gentoo then
[02:42] <twosouls82> hi there BjoeHrn :)
[02:42] <protocol1> is it possible to use two commands in a launcher?
[02:42] <defrysk> Everflex, Trevino Rules
[02:42] <protocol1> if so...can I get an example?
[02:42] <defrysk> Big time
[02:42] <engla> protocol1: I don't think so. Write a short script and launch that
[02:43] <QwertyM> defrysk, its all cosmetic, just that I wanted to endorse it? :P
[02:43] <twosouls82> tonyyarusso: that mode is allowed?
[02:43] <twosouls82> everywhere?
[02:43] <defrysk> QwertyM, hehe :D
[02:43] <Everflex> defrysk: yea.. :D but is there a way to add all the keys of the list in one command?
[02:43] <tonyyarusso> twosouls82: I believe so - try it
[02:43] <w3ccv> protocol1, try appending & to the first - putting it in the background, then a ';' and adding thesecond
[02:43] <w3ccv> s/thesecond/the second/
[02:43] <mrmist> Ok... I'm running Amarok again now :)
[02:43] <defrysk> Everflex, all the keys ?
[02:43] <twosouls82> hahaha, you're not going to be whooped if not, tonyyarusso =)
[02:44] <twosouls82> I will do so though
[02:44] <mrmist> thanks guys, and goodbye :)
[02:44] <Everflex> defrysk: yep.. the gpg keys.
[02:44] <Sebboh> two, define "everywhere"...  It won't work on some other IRC networks/servers.
[02:44] <w3ccv> protocol1, that is if you want both processes to run at the same time, if not forget the &  and they will run one following the other
[02:44] <defrysk> Everflex, one sec I'll msg them to you
[02:45] <Everflex> defrysk: ok, great! :)
[02:45] <w3ccv> protocol1, same as if you put them into a shell script and launch that
[02:45] <Everflex> defrysk: theres just so many keys, and if you are to do it by hand, it can take some time
[02:45] <floris84> aww, I got a real sweet touchscreen pc for free a month ago but the touchscreen driver is giving me a headache :S
[02:46] <Sebboh> Ok, xorg is dying with: (EE) Failed to load module "openchrome" (module does not exist, 0) ...  How do I fix that.  I have a S3 UniChrome display adapter, by the way...
[02:46] <Everflex> floris84: too bad :|
[02:46] <Sebboh> s/that\./that?/
[02:47] <floris84> Everflex: still I won't give up
[02:47] <tim167> is Jashaka video editor available for ubuntu ?
[02:47] <Everflex> floris84: it's propably gonna be awesome when it gets to work :P
[02:47] <floris84> it will be the best jukebox
[02:47] <Znortfl> Good day, I installed the newest nVidia drivers, but when I reboot the X server complains about a mismatch. I need to install the drivers again, but after rebooting they seem to be gone again. Is there anything I did wrong?
[02:48] <floris84> Everflex: yeah, i'm thinking about writing my own driver since I can see the output if I do cat /dev/ttyS3/
[02:48] <floris84> so I'm studying C now in my spare time
[02:49] <Sebboh> Learn the language first, then plan to write a driver. ;)
[02:49] <Everflex> floris84: good luck :)
[02:49] <floris84> yeah, that's my plan, however I hope I can adapt an existing driver
[02:50] <sindrum> which C++ ide are being used?
[02:50] <Sebboh> Hey, guys, I don't have a GUI right now, so, I'm having some trouble finding more information about this problem:

[02:50] <msun> HELP! Brand new ubuntu installation.  I turn on the machine, and after seeing the ubuntu logo at the top of the screen and a few things loading at the bottom, the screen changes to a resolution that my monitor doesn't support!   So I hit CTRL-ALT-F1 and got a terminal.  What can I do now?
[02:51] <floris84> msun: start again in safe graphics mode
[02:51] <floris84> msun: does that work?
[02:51] <Sebboh> Safe mode?  wtf.  Hmmmm....
[02:51] <fyrestrtr> !fixres | msun
[02:51] <Sebboh> =)
[02:51] <ubotu> msun: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[02:51] <msun> floris: already tried that on the livecd and had the same problem. i had to actually use the alternate cd just to install due to this same problem
[02:52] <twosouls82> tonyyarusso: could you try to see if I am allowed to, by ... ;) ?
[02:52] <floris84> Sebbo: safe-graphics mode was what I meant
[02:52] <floris84> msun: try lspci what kind of graphic adapter shows up?
[02:52] <Vixus> what happened to xchat?
[02:52] <Vixus> it used to be cool
[02:52] <Sebboh> Flo, I wouldn't know the difference. =)
[02:52] <Sebboh> Vixus, I know! wtf.
[02:53] <fyrestrtr> Vixus: make sure you are using the real xchat, not that hacked up version that comes with ubuntu.
[02:53] <fyrestrtr> !info xchat
[02:53] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6.6-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 275 kB, installed size 760 kB
[02:53] <Vixus> fyrestrtr: xchat-gnome...?
[02:53] <Vixus> oh
[02:53] <fyrestrtr> Vixus: aye, that be the hacked up version.
[02:53] <Vixus> damn, forgot to add the extra repositories
[02:53] <Sebboh> ahh!  Thanks, fyre
[02:53] <msun> floris: nvidia nv18
[02:53] <Vixus> got a list of all the extra reps?
[02:54] <fyrestrtr> !repositories | Vixus
[02:54] <ubotu> Vixus: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[02:54] <Sebboh> vix, they are built into the package manager, you can just check a box.
[02:54] <Vixus> oh
[02:54] <Vixus> ok
[02:54] <floris84> okay that should be supported I believe
[02:54] <Vixus> brb then
[02:54] <vega-> anyone have D-Link DUB-E100 usb nic working? should work with usbnet driver but mine doesn't
[02:54] <Block> anyone with cyrus imapd?
[02:55] <floris84> you should check your xorg.conf, do you know how-to do that?
[02:55] <msun> nope
[02:55] <vega-> problem is that the driver loads, but still i don't get any "usb0" or similiar
[02:55] <msun> floris: i found this help page, what do you think https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[02:55] <Mazingaro> vega-: ubuntu is just a crap :)
[02:55] <floris84> open a terminal, type vi /etx/X11/xorg.conf
[02:56] <floris84> and scroll down
[02:56] <msun> oh, what is default root pw
[02:56] <Gun_Smoke> I'm trying to rmdir name but I'm getting the error r: Directory not empty
[02:56] <Sebboh> how do I run a configuration routine for xorg?  like, dpkg-reconfigure xorg-???
[02:56] <floris84> you should use sudo
[02:56] <floris84> so sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:56] <Sebboh> msun, there isn't one.  You must sudo.
[02:56] <floris84> and type your own password
[02:56] <floris84> when asked
[02:56] <msun> oh i see
[02:56] <Gun_Smoke> I don't care if it isn't empty.. I want it all gone?
[02:56] <msun> ok got it
[02:57] <vega-> Mazingaro: that's not really what i wanted to hear...
[02:57] <Sebboh> Gunsmoke, rm -r
[02:57] <Gun_Smoke> Thanks
[02:57] <floris84> Gun_Smoke: rm directory -R
[02:57] <Sebboh> btw never make a file called -r .. ;P
[02:57] <floris84> haha
[02:58] <floris84> does anyone know what it means if Xorg gives an error in the likes of module does not have a moduledata data object?
[02:59] <kdjfs> how do i install wine on edgy amd64?
[02:59] <sysrage> making a file named -r really wouldn't make a difference. you'd have to do rm -- -r
[02:59] <Sebboh> X won't start, how do I run a config routine?
[02:59] <Sebboh> sysrage, the problem is when you use a wildcard, and -r ends up in the command line. ;)
[02:59] <floris84> sysrage: cool just learned some more escape characters11
[02:59] <floating> hellou. If I use bittornado on cmd line, start a torrent, and want to start another one in same terminal, like add another torrent, how to do ?
[02:59] <sysrage> that's why you use --
[03:00] <edwardsNdallas> does anyone know of a good remote program that doesn't require a registered IP like VNC to access remotely for ubuntu?
[03:00] <floris84> @floating use & after the command
[03:00] <Sebboh> sysrage, -- = end of arguments, right
[03:00] <sysrage> yes
[03:00] <tim167> HELP: when I transfer a big file to webspace via KftpGrabber, it stops after 8 kb and says 'transfer completed' !
[03:01] <chriswk> Sebboh, don't know if you got this already, but if I remember correctly it's dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver
[03:01] <Sebboh> edwards, hmm, it sounds like VNC isn't the problem.  You need port forwarding. =)  There is no client that will give you a real IP, and you have to use a real IP to talk to your machine from elsewhere on the net.
[03:01] <Sebboh> Edwards, what you can do is set up port forwarding on your router...
[03:01] <Sebboh> chris, thanks.
[03:01] <drunken-wallaby> i have a problem with my acpi-table (probably bugged bios). anyone who can help me with some kernel boot options? the problem is that i see the following message in my /var/log/kern.log: "spurious 8259A interrupt: irq 7". after a while this irq is disabled by the kernel and usb stopps working (i have to manually remove ehci_hcd to get usb at 1.1 speed working).
[03:02] <Sebboh> "xorg-server is not installed"  Well, that might be the problem, eh? ;)
[03:02] <floris84> haha :D
[03:02] <Gun_Smoke> has anyone been able to get SafePeer installed in Azureus?
[03:02] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, hp pavillion dv6000 ?
[03:02] <drunken-wallaby> it's a hp pavilion dv9043ea by the way...
[03:02] <Sebboh> E: couldn't find package xorg-server .. :/
[03:03] <fyrestrtr> Sebboh: xserver-xorg
[03:03] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade almost :) i've tried most combinations of noapic nolapic pnpbios=off biosirq routirq irqpoll but nothing helped... :(
[03:03] <Vixus> fyrestrtr, much better... but why no userlist?
[03:03] <drunken-wallaby> i'm kind of hopeless...
[03:03] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, hp pavilion dv6000+ series is the most linux unfriendly laptop
[03:03] <floating> floris84: hm ok. What means "run with no args"?
=== selzy_imut is now known as v3dY
[03:03] <Vixus> fyrestrtr, i see it
[03:03] <fyrestrtr> Vixus: its probably hidden (I don't use xchat)
[03:03] <edwardsNdallas> sebboh, i use logmein.com without an IP, it uses https to connect but it's windows based. if i set port forwarding on my router, would that present a security risk?
[03:03] <znejk> anyone got i810 to work with s-out in x?
[03:03] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, solution is wait for couple of years for kernel support or throw your computer away
[03:04] <tim167> anyone know why KFTPGRAB finishes transfers prematurely ??
[03:04] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade hm, i guess we can add the dv9000 series to this list then. well, actually i got most other things working...
[03:04] <Vixus> Can anyone tell me how to add custom screen resolutions? Or should I setup my nvidia card first?
[03:04] <Gun_Smoke> reverseblade:  is there a system out there somewhat designed with linux in mind?  Aside from building one yourself...
[03:04] <fyrestrtr> Vixus: setup your card first.
[03:04] <floris84> @floating It means the command you start will accept no other options and is referenced to its target after that
[03:04] <twosouls82> floating: 'konsole -e links' -> with argument (-e links) and 'konsole' -> no arguments
[03:04] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade: holy shit. just bought this notebook :(
[03:04] <fyrestrtr> Gun_Smoke: IBM Thinkpads have great Linux support.
[03:04] <reverseblade> Gun_Smoke, for example HP NX 7010, works perfectly with edgy out of box.
[03:04] <frogzoo> I've got vmware-player installed, now I want to connect it to a tap0 interface - how do you do this?
[03:04] <Vixus> fyrestartr: Is the ubuntuguide a good one to follow?
[03:04] <fyrestrtr> Gun_Smoke: Acer sells laptops with Fedora pre-installed, so does Dell (iirc)
[03:04] <twosouls82> !nvidia | Vixus
[03:04] <ubotu> Vixus: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

[03:05] <drunken-wallaby> fyrestrtr sorry...
[03:05] <Sebboh> Thanks all, gonna reboot.
[03:05] <AlphaN3> Hello. Does anyone happen to know to what font does Monospace map to?
[03:05] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, your headphone jacks working ? opengl working, wireless working ? hibernate working? fan working ?
[03:06] <fyrestrtr> reverseblade: I think he'd know if his fan was not working ;)
[03:06] <reverseblade> fyrestrtr, by working I mean , working properly. Since this is another bug in hp pavilion series
[03:06] <floris84> fyrestrtr: no it just runs on basic mode
[03:06] <kdjfs> how do i install wine on edgy amd64?
[03:06] <floris84> you see a hardcoded temperature range
[03:07] <floris84> and the fan turns at max all the time
[03:07] <fyrestrtr> oh that.
[03:07] <frogzoo> kdjfs: there is now wine for 64bit - you need a 32bit chroot
[03:07] <fyrestrtr> sounds like improper chipset support :(
[03:07] <floris84> my laptop is permanently @ 75 degrees c according to linux
[03:07] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade yeah. headphone jack works on edgy with compiling alsa from source and adding "echo options snd-hda-intel disable_msi=1" to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base. nvidia works, wireless works (with ndiswrapper). didn't manage to get it working with the opensource bcm43xx drivers :/. hibernate works (almost always). what's fan?
[03:07] <frogzoo> 14
[03:07] <floris84> :)
[03:07] <kdjfs> ok,thanks i'll try
[03:08] <floris84> :D haha, the pc fan to keep it cool
[03:08] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, it's the cooler , the propeller rotating under your cpu
[03:08] <floris84> hopefully
[03:08] <Gun_Smoke> So back to my first question, has anyone been able to get SafePeer installed?
[03:08] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade but this irq problem is annoying. since i can't force my girlfriend to manually remove modules just to be able to mount her usb disk...
[03:08] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade how can i check if this works?
[03:08] <Vixus> how do I check which kernel I'm using (I think I know which one but just to be sure)
[03:08] <frogzoo> kdjfs: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WineForAMD64?highlight=%28wine%29
[03:08] <floris84> @vixius uname -r
[03:09] <floris84> wil give you a version
[03:09] <Vixus> cool
[03:09] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, dunno, AFAIK , there are some people complaining about this issue though. Do not neglect this ,learn the check your fan speed or CPu temp if you are gonna use that laptop. for the mounting. I think one of the USB's should work
[03:09] <Vixus> weird, I'm sure I installed the amd64 one... I guess not.
[03:10] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, how do you know your nvidia works ?
[03:10] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade hm, i'll search the wikis for the fam thing.
[03:10] <floating> Hmm. If I start a torrent with btdownloadheadless and & , then I fg the job, but I am not able to put it back in bg it seems, and the terminal is stuck

[03:10] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade no, if irq7 is disabled, no usb port works
[03:11] <tijn> is there any tool to move partitions?

[03:15] <joelol75> What is the EE message (/var/log/Xorg.log.0 or something close to that filename
[03:15] <floris84> jsperlhofer: the icons grow with the size of the toolbars if that's what you mean

[03:19] <joelol75> what command did you mess up?
[03:19] <msun> new install.  ubuntu says i don't have the permissions necessary to view one of my hard disks.
[03:19] <Gumby> does anyone know where the GDM theme manager is in ubuntu?
[03:19] <\pub\bash0r> since I switched to Edgy, dpkg-reconfigure locale does no longer show a menu to select charsets ... how can I achieve this now?
[03:20] <lewyjh> klotho, it most likely has to do with the driver assigned to your wirelss card.
[03:20] <lewyjh> or adapter
[03:20] <dcordes> jsperlhofer: maybe somewhere in gconf-editor.. navigate to apps/nautilus and see there
[03:20] <klotho> lewyjh: yes, so how do I get it to install the correct driver?
[03:20] <Gun_Smoke> where can I look for connected devices such as CD drives?
[03:20] <lewyjh> can anyone help me wtih ndiswrapper?
[03:20] <jsperlhofer> will do! >))
[03:21] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, can you use your USB mice ?
[03:21] <lewyjh> klotho, that's why i pointed you in the direction of the wiki help, they can tell you which drivers are assigned to which wireless adapters and help you through it.
[03:21] <lewyjh> klotho, i don
[03:21] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade sometimes. most of the time the usb mice stopps working after the irq message. sometimes it's the only usb-port that still works
[03:21] <lewyjh> klotho, i don't know how to help you specifically, i'm having a wirelss problem myself.
[03:22] <reverseblade> drunken-wallaby, another BALLmer trap to buy windows :)
[03:22] <joelol75> NForce 430 chipset, (intel8x0 module) no mic boost(had it with nforce2 chipset? Skype unusable? (Too low, can bearly hear myself and its turned all the way up in alsamicer/kmix) Any solutions out there?
[03:22] <jrib> Gumby: system > administration > log window
[03:23] <jrib> login*
[03:23] <lewyjh> does anyone know anything about ndiswrapper?
[03:23] <reverseblade> !ndiswrapper | lewyjh
[03:23] <ubotu> lewyjh: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:23] <drunken-wallaby> reverseblade bevor i use win i'd use free-dos exclusively :)
[03:24] <\pub\bash0r> drunken-wallaby: why not reactos? ;)
[03:24] <floris84> lewyjh: what is your problem with ndiswrapper?
[03:24] <klotho> okay, so if I found the right driver, how do I find out if its already installed or how do I install it?
[03:24] <floating> wireless problem is covered in more than one thread in ubuntu forums. There's lot to read, and many succesful solutions. So check them out if you don't get answer here.
[03:24] <reverseblade> \pub\bash0r, it's immature
[03:24] <\pub\bash0r> as is windows ;)
[03:24] <Vixus> Ok, now X won't even start.
[03:24] <\pub\bash0r> so it is already a good replacement :D
[03:24] <reverseblade> not at all
[03:24] <Vixus> I love Windows
[03:24] <drunken-wallaby> hehe :)
[03:25] <reverseblade> we should admit windows xp is an OK operating system
[03:25] <Smotang> Windows is alright, but its not free.
[03:25] <joelol75> Vixus: what happened?
[03:25] <Zcruf> I cant seem to mount my extern hard drive.. Ive tried to mount /dev/hda1 but nothing seems to work
[03:25] <floris84> still no windows setup feels as good as the freedom and spirit of opensource software
[03:26] <floris84> microsoft makes me quite paranoid at times
[03:26] <Edulix> any deb repository with OpenOffice.org 2.1?
[03:26] <Edulix> (hi !)
[03:26] <Vixus> joelol75: I followed the ubuntu wiki guide, used nvidia-xconfig to write to xorg's conf and now when I start ubuntu the loading thing at the start is in grayscale with like 2 colour depth (this was always the case) but now the login won't show and the computer just sits silent.
[03:26] <floris84> plus the nagging of serial keys licenses and other stuff like that
[03:26] <klotho> for example, in device manager I don't see either of the ethernet cards, and in network settings I don't see what device drivers it's using
[03:26] <\pub\bash0r> Edulix: IIRC you can directly download the deb files from openoffice.org
[03:26] <whyameye> I lost the key to my Windows CD and it took a week of calling for them to find one for me.
[03:27] <Edulix> \pub\bash0r: ok
[03:27] <Vixus> Argh... why? Why can't I install my nVidia drivers smoothly and get wifi working? Why?
[03:27] <floris84> whyameye: exactly the troubles you have with windows are not of a technical nature but a bureaucratic one
[03:28] <drunken-wallaby> where can i find a list with acpi related kernel boot-options?
[03:28] <Ubuntuguy> HI all -- I'm running ubuntu dapper on amd 64.  I see that there are several media players available (mplaer, gxine, vlc, etc) and am looking for a recommendation.
[03:28] <floris84> I have all of them actually
[03:29] <joelol75> Vixus: You are using the nvidia drivers from their website, changed "nv" to nvidia in Xorg.conf??? BTW I am pretty sure the nvidia ncurses installer backs up the xorg.conf.DATEAPPENDED so you can restore
[03:29] <LjL> Ubuntuguy: same as floris84. and if you want to be able to read most formats, you probably want to have the win32 codecs (as unfortunate as that may be)
[03:29] <Vixus> joelol75:: I can't restore because now I can't login at all.
[03:29] <jhaig> It may have changed, but it used to be the case that none supported all media types, so you really need to have several, unfortunately.
[03:29] <\pub\bash0r> since I switched to Edgy, "dpkg-reconfigure locales" does no longer show a menu to select charsets ... how can I achieve this now?
[03:29] <floris84> anyway you can get those via the easyubuntu script
[03:30] <Vixus> joelol75: I didn't change nv... damn damn damn.
[03:30] <dcordes> how can i enable tv-out in fglrx?
[03:30] <joelol75> vixus: thats not good...  Try CTL-ALT-F2?
[03:30] <Vixus> ok
[03:30] <Vixus> joelol75: By the way, what does CTRL+ALT+F11 do?
[03:31] <Ubuntuguy> LjL: Yeah but there are no 64-bit libs foro win32 codecs.  Anyway, If I have all the players (forgot totem), what should I set up as the default plugin for firefox.  Does VLC have a FF plugin?
[03:31] <joelol75> vixus: Not sure...  I just tryed it, got a black screen with a blinky cursor....
[03:31] <xXx>

[03:31] <washbear> is the threat of a virus in a linux system slowly becoming real?
[03:31] <Vixus> joelol75: Good. So it's not supposed to do anything? :D
[03:32] <Vixus> other than spit up weird graphics
[03:32] <klotho> okay, it seems to have loaded a reasonable driver, and its logical name is wlan0, which implies wireless, but in that case why does Network Settings call it a "wired device"?
[03:32] <LjL> Ubuntuguy: VLC is probably a nice enough choice, it can read many formats by default without the win32 codecs

[03:32] <jhaig> washbear: In theory, yes (in fact, there is a Linux Virus HowTo around somewhere).  In practice, it is very unlikely.
[03:32] <\pub\bash0r> LjL: since 0.8.6 it even reads wmv9 :)
[03:33] <joelol75> vixus: ctl-alt-f7 is X session

[03:33] <klotho> and network tools doesn't show it, even though network settings shows that it's enabled
[03:33] <Vixus> joelol75: Ok, so when I go into text-mode (F2) what do I do?
[03:33] <washbear> jhaig - symantec seems to have one listed, low risk from 2002, good to keep up-to-date, although i am sure the news would soon spread if there was a real threat
[03:34] <klotho> lshw shows it as disabled, but network settings shows it as enabled... any idea what to look at?
[03:34] <washbear> jhaig - http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2004-052312-2729-99
[03:35] <joelol75> vixus: login, and type cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | less and see if 'nv' as the driver is 'nvidia'
[03:35] <Vixus> ok
[03:36] <jhaig> washbear: It requires root access, as far as I can tell.  One of the main reasons that Windows is so prone to viruses is that most people run with full administrator rights all the time.  In Linux, you really have to go out of your way to do that.

[03:39] <pinchartl> I'd like to request an openldap backport for edgy. I compiled openldap2.3 (apt-get build-dev openldap2.3 && apt-get source -b openldap-2.3) successfully. the .deb packages install without any problem, but both libldap-2.2.26 and libldap-2.3.29 are now installed side by side. would that make the backport invalid per rule 3. (No new libraries that have negative impact on ANY other system component) ?
[03:39] <danny500> Um I'm having a problem with programs getting kicked off all of a sudden for no reason, whats going on?

[03:40] <LjL> pinchartl: at any rate... i don't know precisely what the backports rule are, but if the libraries are actually installed *side by side*, i.e. they don't interfer with each other, i'm not sure that should be a problem
[03:40] <jrib> pinchartl: you can't request a backport if it isn't in feisty by the way, since there isn't anything to backport

[03:44] <danny500> then start it lol
[03:45] <jrib> ubotu: tell cz_cniry about mysql
[03:45] <LjL> floating: that command line is telling your system to accept connections to ports from 6881 up to 6999. it should be completely useless, though, since Ubuntu comes with no restrictive firewalling rules by default, so those ports should already be open
[03:45] <crimsun> jrib: no, vlc can't handle some proprietary formats, because I didn't enable its w32loader.

[03:53] <Pitchdown> so the live-cd is the same as the install cd ?
[03:54] <cyberjunkie> desktop is the livecd + option to install on hdd
[03:54] <cyberjunkie> ?
[03:54] <Pitchdown> ok thx
[03:54] <Pitchdown> i download it now
[03:54] <cyberjunkie> nono ist a question!
[03:54] <Pitchdown> but what do i have now?
[03:54] <cyberjunkie> its a question! D:
[03:54] <Pitchdown> the machine was installing
[03:54] <cyberjunkie> haha
[03:54] <LjL> danny500: use #ubuntu-bots, or just type /query ubotu, for experiments (or to find factoids if you don't know they exist). doing it in here spams the channel... and i've given three warnings already ;)
[03:54] <twosouls82> Pitchdown: the alternate installer is much nicer, has a textmode, much more options
[03:54] <jrib> Pitchdown: you already installed, just try what LjL said
[03:54] <Vixus> joelol75: No, when I press F2... there's a bright flash and then it fades pixelly into grey... what??
[03:55] <danny500> ok no more
[03:55] <twosouls82> and yes, the desktop cd is a livecd that installs too
[03:55] <bmgz> I have a new digital camera (canon powershot a640). It doesn't show up on the gnome desktop when I switch it on, I made an entry in the /etc/udev/45-libgphoto2... file and I can now access it from gthumb. My problem is that it still doesn't automatically show up on my desktop like my other camera. I have tried to write a device information file for HAL but it doesn't seem to work? any pointers?
[03:55] <x-r00t-x> sup guys
[03:55] <deep`> cyberjunkie, haha, you'r right anyway ;)
[03:55] <cyberjunkie> 64bit doesnt seem to be happening anwhere twosouls82 :P
[03:55] <cyberjunkie> ooh goodie~
[03:55] <cyberjunkie> why doesnt the ubuntu community use the term LiveCD ! D:
[03:55] <jrib> cyberjunkie: because the desktop cd is a live cd and the installer
[03:56] <kjaer> Hey guys. Any pointers to how to install sun jdk 6 (1.6) ?
[03:56] <twosouls82> because this one can install and has a fully functional dekstop on it cyberjunkie
[03:56] <cyberjunkie> ah ok
[03:56] <twosouls82> kjaer: you beat  me
[03:56] <cyberjunkie> been 5yrs. no linux ;P just giving it a try :>
[03:56] <LjL> cyberjunkie: because it makes no sense :P the CD isn't alive. other operating systems always had "live" CDs or diskettes, but they never were called such - they did give you a desktop and an "Install on HD" icon, just like what the Ubuntu Desktop CD does
[03:56] <kjaer> twosouls82, Beat you ?
[03:56] <kjaer> Well, make-jpkg can't do it. I know there's only a release candidate.
[03:57] <cyberjunkie> so the livecd desktop has any option of.. say.. creating a temp folder on fat32 partitions and storing settings etc?
[03:57] <twosouls82> you gave the same answer, much quicker, much shorter, chappeaux
[03:57] <x-r00t-x> :) hi everyone
[03:57] <\pub\bash0r> since I switched to Edgy, "dpkg-reconfigure locales" does no longer show a menu to select charsets ... how can I achieve this now?
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[03:58] <Gun_Smoke> I seem to be stuck in man  ... How do I get out?
[03:58] <Vixus> how do i edit the grub commandline to boot straight into a text environment??
[03:58] <kjaer> Gun_Smoke, q
[03:58] <jfrench> ctrl+z
[03:58] <Gun_Smoke> Thanks
[03:59] <kjaer> Vixus, You always want text-only at boot ?
[03:59] <jfrench> no problems
[03:59] <Adam_G> Hi people. How can I disable user accounts? judging by my auth.log someone's trying to brute-force me...
[03:59] <Vixus> *sigh*
[03:59] <Vixus> I need text only right now
[03:59] <x-r00t-x> Vixus, sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:59] <Vixus> please
[03:59] <Vixus> no
[03:59] <Vixus> wrong
[03:59] <Vixus> from the grub menu
[03:59] <x-r00t-x> Vixus, what you want to do ?
[04:00] <Vixus> from the grub menu
[04:00] <Vixus> sorry
[04:00] <Vixus> Ubuntu has died and I have no way of gaining access to it.
[04:00] <Vixus> I need to try and edit my xorg.conf
[04:01] <HuibertGill> Vixus: it is init=1 afaik
[04:01] <Vixus> I would like to boot straight into a text environment
[04:01] <Vixus> ok
[04:01] <Vixus> thanks
[04:01] <jrib> !enter | Vixus
[04:01] <ubotu> Vixus: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:01] <frogzoo> Vixus: choose'recovery' from grub prompt
[04:01] <Vixus> Sorry.
[04:01] <kjaer> Adam_G, man usermod look at the -l switch.
[04:01] <leDemente> Hi everyone!
[04:01] <leDemente> I'm coming back!
[04:01] <Vixus> Recovery mode doesn't work. Do I just append init=1 to the end?
[04:02] <Vixus> brb
[04:02] <Molly_156> Hi guys - I have somehow locked myself out of access to some of my directories by trying to change permissions.
[04:02] <Molly_156> I do not have a root account enabled, but was using MC, which acts as root.
[04:03] <jrib> Molly_156: what directories?
[04:03] <Smotang> ouch
[04:03] <Molly_156> I can't get into /var/www, which is what I was trying to set.
[04:03] <twosouls82> Molly_156: mc setuid?
[04:03] <Molly_156> I can FTP, but can't upload. That's why I was trying to change them.
[04:03] <Adam_G> kjaer, thank you
[04:03] <LjL> Molly_156: mc acts as root? wow
[04:03] <LjL> Molly_156: what about just using sudo like you're supposed to? ;)
[04:03] <Molly_156> Well, if you start it using sudo.
[04:03] <twosouls82> how develish
[04:03] <LjL> Molly_156: err... yeah. what did you change permissions to?
[04:03] <Molly_156> I realize I should do that now. :)
[04:03] <twosouls82> s/devel/devil/g
[04:03] <kjaer> Molly_156, chown www-dev:www-dev /var/www ; Then add your user to the www-dev group.
[04:04] <LjL> kjaer: isn't that www-data by default?
[04:04] <jrib> no it's root by default
[04:04] <Molly_156> I'm really not very knowledgeable about the permissions. Is that the exact command I put in?
[04:04] <Molly_156> I changed permissions to 750.
[04:04] <twosouls82> LjL: indeed www-data here, initially ;)
[04:04] <kjaer> LjL, Sorry no idea.
[04:04] <jrib> LjL: I found out recently that you shouldn't give ownership to www-data, that's what apache runs as
[04:05] <LjL> jrib: it is? bah, then i need to subscribe to the elite club of mess-with-chown-and-don't-remember-you-did
[04:05] <twosouls82> jrib: that where the default settings here, I needed to change that manualli
[04:05] <HuibertGill> jrib: isn't that why you give it www-data _because_ apache runs as it?
[04:05] <Molly_156> That command gives me an invalid user kjaer
[04:05] <twosouls82> -i +y
[04:05] <LjL> HuibertGill: well, apache just needs to be able to *read* the stuff
[04:05] <kjaer> Molly_156, Then add the user
[04:05] <Gumby> does anyone here know where the gnome-session manager stores its per user settings?
[04:05] <Rprp> Well, i just updated my Server Kernel, but its not starting now, how can i fix it? :E
[04:05] <Molly_156> I dont' know how.
[04:06] <HuibertGill> LjL: yes. correct
[04:06] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Molly_156 about adduser | Molly_156, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:06] <twosouls82> LjL: it was the same here, I didn't set it to www-data myself
[04:06] <jhaig> Gumby: $HOME/.gnome ?
[04:06] <kjaer> Molly_156, system -> administration -> users and groups
[04:06] <LjL> HuibertGill: so maybe, owner=root, group=www-data, and no write permissions to the group. or something.
[04:06] <Molly_156> It says "user already exists.
[04:07] <LjL> twosouls82: it's weird though, i'm quite sure jrib isn't the first one telling me they're root:root by default
[04:07] <Molly_156> I'm in console only, I'm lost.
[04:07] <Molly_156> I'm trying really hard, but I'm lost.
[04:07] <LjL> Molly_156: you're trying to add yourself to the www-something group, is that it?
[04:07] <Gumby> jhaig: one might think that but it isnt
[04:07] <twosouls82> LjL: I have root:www-data, set it myself, I thought that was an 'unsafe feature'
[04:07] <jrib> LjL, HuibertGill: you could set the group and have read only group permssions.  But the owner that has write access should not be www-data
[04:07] <Molly_156> I honestly don't know. I'm just trying to get my one account to have write permission for FTP.
[04:07] <kjaer> Molly_156, Okay. useradd or adduser is the commands.
[04:08] <twosouls82> LjL: odd that we are the only one's
[04:08] <LjL> jrib: ok, i understand your reasoning, but i still don't remember changing the owner manually... nor does HuibertGill apparently
[04:08] <jhaig> Gumby: or $HOME/.gnome2 or $HOME/.gnome2_private
[04:08] <LjL> jrib: so either we're both forgetful, or Ubuntu does something weird when you install apache
[04:09] <Molly_156> So, what would have happened that would have blocked me from my /var/www dir even in SSH?
[04:09] <patrick_> is webmin accessabke from outside of the network
[04:09] <patrick_> ?
[04:09] <Pooper> does anyone have time for a n00b? :P
[04:09] <jrib> LjL: yeah, I'm not 100% sure.  I seem to remember mine being root:root at one point though :/  We need a fresh user
[04:09] <LjL> Molly_156: ah, for FTP... uhm, not too familiar with that. i thought you were talking local user
[04:09] <Molly_156> I am, now.
[04:09] <LjL> !webmin | patrick_
[04:09] <ubotu> patrick_: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
[04:09] <Molly_156> Now I'm hosed as a local user as well.
[04:09] <rbonnin> Do you know any OSS SMTP gateway?
[04:09] <kjaer> Molly_156, Give me a sec.
[04:10] <patrick_> is there something like webmin
[04:10] <Gumby> jhaig: negative and negative.  already looked there.
[04:10] <LjL> patrick_: maybe, but i don't know about it
[04:10] <jorgp> anyone know of a repos for gnome 2.16 for dapper?
[04:10] <jhaig> Gumby: Well, what exactly are you looking for?
[04:10] <Helpmeee> Hello, im having some trouble installing ubuntu. Everything goes black after the loading screen
[04:10] <Molly_156> FTP will work the same way, whatever I'm set as for local, will be that for FTP.
[04:10] <Helpmeee> it says "video mode not supported"
[04:10] <patrick_> ljl:why is not supported anymore
[04:10] <Gumby> jhaig: I am looking to see where it reads its startup items from
[04:11] <LjL> patrick_: call me "messenger", and don't kill me :P
[04:11] <jrib> Gumby: ~/.config/autostart/
[04:11] <jhaig> patrick_: Probably because it is horribly insecure.
[04:11] <Gumby> jrib: thank you
[04:11] <patrick_> arh ok, i was only wondering, i havent used for about 5 years when i had red hat
[04:12] <kjaer> useradd www-dev --home /var/www -p password --shell /bin/bash; chown www-dev:www-dev /var/www; chmod 755 /var/www
[04:12] <kjaer> Molly_156, Should fix it
[04:12] <kjaer> Then log in with the www-dev user
[04:12] <Gumby> jrib: and what about the gnome specific entries, such as update-notifier
[04:12] <HuibertGill> patrick_: webmin was created wenn it was hard to admin a box properly.
[04:12] <HuibertGill> patrick_: in ubuntu the the gnome amdin tool offer al lyou need (tm)
[04:12] <jhaig> patrick_: Actually, I think it is because it was only being supported in Debian by one person, and that one person decided to stop doing it.
[04:12] <Molly_156> So I understand, am I creating a group called www-dev?
[04:13] <kjaer> Molly_156, It should be auto created to be the default group for the www-dev user
[04:13] <MrQuincle> not so newby...: when I edit xorg.conf and add 1280x1024 (supported by Dell E197FP) the screen goes blinking
[04:13] <Molly_156> This may be a stupid statement -- but I dont' want a www-dev user.
[04:13] <jrib> Gumby: checked ~/.gnome2/session ?
[04:13] <Molly_156> Can I not get permissions back for my own account?
[04:13] <kjaer> You want your normal user ?
[04:14] <Gumby> jrib: yep
[04:14] <Molly_156> Yes.
[04:14] <Gumby> jrib: actually, I dont even have that file
[04:14] <kjaer> Molly_156, Do what I said, and add your user to the www-dev group.
[04:14] <vlraptor> ?
[04:14] <Molly_156> By chmoding to 755, I got my access back via SSH
[04:14] <FYI> hello everyone, I'm having trouble with gsynaptics, I need to set SHMConfig to 'true' in xorg.conf, but I don't know where to do it exactly
[04:16] <Gumby> FYI... Section "InputDevice"
[04:16] <Gumby>         Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
[04:16] <Gumby> first hit on google
[04:16] <Gumby> "SHMConfig"
[04:16] <LjL> jrib: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/apache2/+bug/7856
[04:16] <FYI> lol, thanks Gumby :-[
[04:16] <Gumby> or whatever your default mouse is
[04:17] <LjL> jrib: (and https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/apache2/+bug/62068 , but that's undecided unconfirmed and uncommented)
[04:17] <zerod`> not sure
[04:17] <Gumby> may not be "Synaptics Touchpad"
[04:17] <Coban> #connect
[04:18] <Vixus> init=1 does nothing. How do I alter my grub commandline to enter into Ubuntu text-mode?
[04:18] <salambander> Absolute newb here. I'm using the GUI and having trouble installing newly downloaded software. At the moment I'm trying to install Ktorrent. Can anyone give me a walk through, f it's not too much trouble?
[04:18] <heikki> what if you start your ubuntu in the standard way and then when X has failed to start you push ctrl+alt+f2?
[04:19] <Adam_G> How would I go about blocking an IP address from connecting to me?
[04:19] <kjaer> salambander, go to system - administration - synaptics
[04:19] <kjaer> search for ktorrent, select it and press the install button
[04:20] <salambander> Thanks
[04:21] <leDemente> I have 2 harddrives, 40GB, 120GB. Which would be best to make / ?
[04:21] <apz> how can i unpack .rpm files ?
[04:21] <Adam_G> leDemente, I personally would use the smaller one as /, then use the larger one as the mountpoint for /home
[04:22] <kjaer> :-)
[04:22] <leDemente> Hmm.
[04:22] <kjaer> apz, Install the program called alien
[04:22] <jrib> apz: what is it an rpm for?
[04:22] <twosouls82> leDemente: I would do the same as Adam_G except for the addition of a /mnt/shared if you have more users who will be using the same files
[04:23] <twosouls82> on the biggest that is
[04:23] <leDemente> No, I doubt that I will.
[04:23] <apz> can you give me the syntax ?
[04:23] <jrib> !rpm | apz
[04:23] <ubotu> apz: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[04:23] <salambander> What if I wanted to download some sort of freeware that isn't on the package list? Eg Laxius power (if there's a Linux version). Would I do the same thing - download it, then go to Synaptics?
[04:24] <Helpmeee> Hello, im having some trouble installing ubuntu. Everything goes black after the loading screen
[04:24] <Helpmeee> it says "video mode not supported"
[04:24] <jrib> salambander: no, it would depend on how the software is provided
[04:24] <kjaer> salambander, You would search for it in synaptics first.
[04:24] <kjaer> Then you would ask google for a deb package.
[04:24] <kjaer> Then you would search their website.
[04:24] <kjaer> Then you would compile the source.
[04:24] <salambander> Uhuh... How doI compile the source?
[04:25] <nuked_omen> will microsoft port their office to linux?
[04:25] <kjaer> nuked_omen, no.
[04:25] <salambander> Sacriledge!
[04:25] <kjaer> salambander, Pray you don't have to go that far.
[04:25] <nuked_omen> why not? i think it's a good idea cuz more people will use it
[04:25] <Adam_G> More people using office is a good thing?
[04:26] <kjaer> nuked_omen, It is not free software or anything. So you shouldn't use it.
[04:26] <krang> Anyone know why this command isn't creating files filled full o' random bytes for me? dd if=/dev/random of=reallylargefile count=2097152
[04:26] <RyanTMulligan> What's it called when you type ctrl-alt-f1 and it brings you to a terminal screen?
[04:26] <krang> It just sits there doing nothing
=== rsa| is now known as rsa[aw] 
[04:26] <kjaer> RyanTMulligan, Going to tty1 ?
[04:26] <salambander> Also, it's full of bugs. Yes, it would be slightly easier to get used to, but it defeats the whole purpose of using opensource OS in the first place.
[04:26] <nuked_omen> Adam_G, for ms, yea
[04:26] <Adam_G> are we ms?
[04:26] <RyanTMulligan> kjaer: thanks!
[04:27] <nuked_omen> sometimes
[04:27] <kjaer> Besides OO.o is good enough.
[04:27] <salambander> Hail kjaer! Mighty aider of all! *kowtows*
[04:28] <Adam_G> honestly, OO.o sucks. (but abiword is better than either MSO or OOo)
[04:28] <nuked_omen> OO.o might be even better, but i have to use ms office at work
[04:28] <pty> kjaer: OO.o is good enough if your company doesn't use any fancy MS Office features (collaberation, vba etc)
[04:28] <nuked_omen> so i ain't got the choice
[04:28] <tarzan_> hi... i installed new nvidia drivers from nvidia.com. it works, but now everytime i restart the system gdm won't start saying the versions of glx and the nvidia-module mismatch... the glx module is 9631, whereas the kernel module is older... any ideas?
[04:28] <nuked_omen> abiword sucks.. LyX rules
[04:28] <kjaer> nuked_omen, Do you use macros or anything ?
[04:28] <kjaer> nuked_omen, texmacs > lyx.
[04:28] <nuked_omen> kjaer, don't know what those are, so no
[04:29] <salambander> Even if you use the Linux/Ubuntu software, you can save it as .doc and then open it with ms word. Theoretically. I haven't tried it yet
[04:29] <kjaer> Besides everyone should just use vim..
[04:29] <nuked_omen> salambander, i have, and it doesn't come up the same
[04:29] <kjaer> .doc support is at least as good in oo.o as in ms office.
[04:29] <kjaer> Which is sad, really.
[04:30] <nuked_omen> yeah, it makes OO.o bound to ms office
[04:30] <osfameron> when I used lyx it generated invalid tex :-)
[04:30] <salambander> nuked_omen: Ah. My bad.
[04:30] <osfameron> which was annoying, as the reason I wanted to use lyx was to avoid having to learn tex :D
[04:30] <osfameron> then again, I was playing with it rather than actually using it seriously
[04:30] <kjaer> osfameron, I use texmacs for everything. Try it.
[04:31] <nuked_omen> i find doing the tex code a bit distracting
[04:31] <nuked_omen> i don't use lyx only because it does the code, but it lets me focus more on the content
[04:31] <osfameron> kjaer: cool, I'll check it out
[04:32] <funkyHat> tarzan_, why did you need the new drivers from nvidia.com? you may be able to fix it by running sudo rmmod nvidia and then trying to start gdm again...
[04:32] <kjaer> osfameron, But remember to use the shortcuts. The menus are painful.
[04:32] <nuked_omen> everything starts with alt+m
[04:32] <tarzan_> funkyHat: aiglx with nvidia drivers
[04:32] <osfameron> kjaer: yeah.  Oh... just occured to me tex*macs* might be emacs based?  eeek!
[04:32] <kjaer> nuked_omen, headlines alt+[1,2,3] 
[04:32] <kjaer> osfameron, It is not :-)
[04:33] <osfameron> I was considering latex-suite for vim, but that has a learning curve too
[04:33] <funkyHat> tarzan_, isn't that supported in the latest nvidia drivers in edgy?
[04:33] <osfameron> kjaer: excellent
[04:33] <kjaer> But there are some awkward shortcuts
[04:33] <kjaer> super + T + n + b new block in table.
[04:34] <nuked_omen> osfameron, latex isn't really hard to learn, cuz it's mainly markup.. so if you're used to html, it won't be a 'big' problem
[04:34] <osfameron> cool!  I have texmacs installed on cygwin already so can try from work pc
[04:34] <tarzan_> funkyHat: it works much better with the newer drivers...
[04:34] <osfameron> oh, except for my x server being badly configured.  *sigh*  I'll install on ubuntu lappy then...
[04:35] <sheriff> how can i know my real ip address
[04:35] <kjaer> sheriff, myip.dk
[04:35] <krang> Anyone know why this command isn't generating me a file full o' random data? It just sits there doing nothing: dd if=/dev/random of=100MB count=204800
[04:35] <funkyHat> tarzan_, ahh ok (wouldn't know I'm running Gentoo on my nVidia machine)
[04:35] <pty> sherrif: /sbin/ifconfig
[04:35] <salambander> sheriff: you could /whois yourself.
[04:36] <tarzan_> hi... i installed new nvidia drivers from nvidia.com. it works, but now everytime i restart the system gdm won't start saying the versions of glx and the nvidia-module mismatch... the glx module is 9631, whereas the kernel module is older... any ideas?
[04:36] <sheriff> salambander : thanks
[04:36] <nuked_omen> gotta jet
[04:36] <nuked_omen> later
[04:36] <funkyHat> tarzan_, any luck unloading the nvidia module then trying again? If you installed the nvidia.com drivers correctly it should have updated the nvidia kernel module, so all you need to do is rmmod the old one then start X again
[04:36] <Menisk> sheriff: You can also go to www.whatismyip.com
[04:37] <tarzan_> funkyHat: the driver works nicely, until i restart the pc

[04:40] <Zaggynl> Hi, I'm using the TeamSpeak 2 client, but my sound recording stopped working in ubuntu
[04:40] <jrib> Matt: edgy: ipmi_devintf.ko  ipmi_msghandler.ko  ipmi_poweroff.ko  ipmi_si.ko  ipmi_watchdog.ko
[04:40] <Gun_Smoke> How do I unpack a tar from the command line?
[04:40] <Zaggynl> Is there a way -besides rebooting- to fix this?
[04:40] <jrib> Gun_Smoke: tar xf file.tar
[04:40] <Matt> thankyou very much
[04:40] <chable> tar -xvf archive.tar
[04:40] <n2diy> What directories should I have backed up, if I need to restore my system?
[04:40] <Matt> that's just what I needed :&)
[04:40] <Zaggynl> What's a quick way to restart sound service
[04:41] <Gun_Smoke> jrib: chable: are those both one in the same?

[04:41] <Lapfunc> hi.  trying to get devilspie working.  i have a condition file in ~/.devilspie/ with the suffix .ds, and i have devilspie running, but when i launch the application that should match, devilspie does nothing.  the condition i'm using is here: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/n94uPx53.html and the app i'm launching is gnome-terminal.  any ideas?
[04:41] <jrib> Gun_Smoke: v = verbose
[04:41] <chable> indeed
[04:41] <Gun_Smoke> Thanks then guys.
[04:42] <dudanogueira> on edgy, where i should mess up for enable/disabling services from running on boot?
[04:42] <boink> anyone here using pure_ftpd on dapper?
[04:42] <boink> the debian version of pure_ftpd works very well, but the ubuntu version won't do virutal users
[04:43] <chable> brb
[04:43] <n2diy> dudanoqueria, system/admin/services
[04:43] <dudanogueira> boink, it could be an option inserted on the compilation time (im guessing)
[04:43] <boink> who knows? with apt-get you just install a binary
[04:44] <dudanogueira> n2diy, the service in question (openvpn) isnt show at this dialog
[04:44] <boink> I really think the ubuntu version is broken
[04:44] <php-freak> ow do I export openoffice files into a ms word files so its readable?
[04:44] <boink> php-freak: save as
[04:44] <php-freak> i renamed it to .doc, and my client tried to open it, but she said it was encrypted
[04:44] <dudanogueira> boink, you also can compile it for yourself. try to check the version avalible on debian and compare it with the ubuntus version
[04:45] <boink> gosh .. it's so nice wasting time when things are broken in ubuntu
[04:45] <chable> ok
[04:45] <dudanogueira> php-freak, on the save as dialog, insert the .doc at the end of the filename
[04:45] <n2diy> dudanoqueira, then take a look around in /etc/services
[04:45] <php-freak> i saved it as ms word xp
[04:45] <php-freak> is it the encoding?
[04:45] <dudanogueira> boink, isnt broken, is diferent... one time i prefered to use samba on ubuntu repos, beacuse the debian samba doesnt had mac osx support
[04:46] <boink> I think it's broken.
[04:46] <boink> with debian, I had it up and running with virutal users within 5 minutes
[04:46] <boink> with ubuntu, doesn't work at all
[04:46] <dudanogueira> on ubuntu it was a newer version, and with compilations options that allowed macosx access, debian no. every distro set the default compilations options for feet their needs
[04:47] <boink> and the newer version doesn't allow virtual users? great
[04:47] <mnoir> php-freak: http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/IRC_Communication lists like 20 oo channels to ask this kind of question
[04:47] <dudanogueira> boink, compare the two versions
[04:47] <boink> or the newer version doesn't have documentation and they expect us to read their minds.
[04:47] <mrtanooki> hiy
[04:47] <boink> great .. dammit, what a waste of time

[04:59] <boink> ubuntu has a different way of using "root"
[04:59] <boink> but it's still root
[04:59] <L0cKd0wN> yea, it blows my mind lol
[04:59] <chable> i need to install java
[04:59] <boink> don't we all
[04:59] <jrib> ubotu: tell chable about java

[05:00] <scythe128> boink that any better than sudo bash? :)
[05:00] <boink> it is sudo bash
[05:00] <L0cKd0wN> does sshd work outta the box?
[05:01] <boink> no
[05:01] <boink> apt-get install ssh
[05:01] <L0cKd0wN> !?!?!
[05:01] <boink> (that's for the server)
[05:01] <L0cKd0wN> this box has no monitor, and I have no KVM heh
[05:01] <boink> if you want to ssh out of your box, that should work (I think)
[05:01] <L0cKd0wN> -1 for ubuntu lol
[05:01] <jrib> yeah, ssh installs the client and server
[05:01] <boink> then apt-get install ssh for the ssh server
[05:01] <boink> jrib: so the client is not automagically installed?
[05:01] <L0cKd0wN> yea im used to sshd being available after installation of the OS
[05:01] <L0cKd0wN> and yum
[05:02] <jrib> boink: it might be
[05:02] <L0cKd0wN> ;)

[05:07] <php-freak> jerp: well I want every too look the same like my desktop to look the same like every at the top, and bottom. I just want the icons to be smaller, text better looking, and stuff to that nature
[05:07] <php-freak> now if install this thing you guys just gave me can i always go back to my old desktop look?
[05:07] <L0cKd0wN> AzMoo: use wine to run utorrent
[05:07] <yakumo> <QwertyM>every time i use the sudo nvidia-xconfig or edit the /etc/X11/XvMCConfig to nvidia... i cant accrss my desktop only error mssg apeear that the must be sonething wrong with my /etc/x11/ configuration
[05:08] <AzMoo> L0cKd0wN, good call.
[05:08] <L0cKd0wN> :), i've done it
[05:08] <L0cKd0wN> works beautifully
[05:09] <jerp> php-freak whatever that means ;)
[05:09] <yakumo> QwertyM> but when i change back the nvidia to nv using nano /etc/x11... i am able to access my desktop ..
[05:09] <php-freak> if i download kde, will i be able to go back to my old desktop look?
[05:09] <php-freak> jerp: thats what i was asking sorry
[05:09] <L0cKd0wN> gonna detach this monitor and connect to the box
[05:09] <boink> php-freak: you could try kubuntu
[05:09] <yakumo> QwertyM>any idea why?
[05:09] <php-freak> thats what im downloading right now is kubuntu
[05:09] <L0cKd0wN> how would I get xchat? apt-get .... install xchat
[05:09] <php-freak> ain't kubuntu kde?
[05:09] <QwertyM> yakumo, how did you install those drivers, thro repos or envy or manual ?
[05:09] <L0cKd0wN> apt-get xchat ?
[05:09] <Bakefy> is there a program out there that will convert m4a to mp3?
[05:09] <chable> those at ro.ubuntu.com dont have enough bandwidth
[05:09] <boink> php-freak: are you using ubuntu now?
[05:09] <QwertyM> mebbe they arent installed properly
[05:09] <php-freak> yeyes
[05:09] <e1Photon> L0cKd0wN, yea apt-get install xchat
[05:09] <php-freak> I'm using ubuntu
[05:10] <yakumo> <QwertyM>repos
[05:10] <boink> php-freak: so you could install kubuntu
[05:10] <L0cKd0wN> cool, this is gonna take gettin' used to heh
[05:10] <php-freak> So basically ubuntu is the desktop im using, or would it be called gnome?
[05:10] <chable> sudo apt-get install xchat xchat-systray
[05:10] <L0cKd0wN> gnome php-freak
[05:10] <php-freak> boink: im installing kubuntu right now
[05:10] <boink> kubuntu-desktop - Kubuntu desktop system
[05:10] <jerp> php-freak, If I were an English teacher I'd say there is something by ways of a subject missing here; "well I want every too look the same like my desktop to look the same like every at the top"
[05:10] <boink> still if that's what you want from a winow manager
[05:10] <boink> if not, there are many other window managers out there
[05:11] <L0cKd0wN> php-freak: gnome is the desktop manager, there are different flavors that run on the OS ubuntu, there's also KDE and XFCE which are popular
[05:11] <chable> java is up
[05:11] <boink> xfce is "xubuntu" :)

[05:13] <php-freak> I suppose im using gdm desktop right now, and need to switch to kdm
[05:13] <GK> I have twin CD set - live CD and OS installation ... those CD's do not have source or any extra stuff in it
[05:14] <L0cKd0wN> php-freak: if you have KDE installed you should be able to log out and switch the session upon login
[05:14] <php-freak> How would I do that?
[05:15] <e1Photon> there is a little icon on the bottom left of the login screen
[05:15] <L0cKd0wN> Should be an option to choose the session to load, go look :P
[05:15] <php-freak> This unbunti configuration came up, and asked if i wanted to use kdm, or gdm, I select kdm

[05:17] <php-freak> so with kde installed I can choose from multiple desktops
[05:17] <e1Photon> php-freak, yes
[05:17] <yakumo> do i need to uninstall my nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common
[05:17] <php-freak> nice
[05:17] <AzMoo> L0cKd0wN, I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to run. Did you use the ubuntu version, or get it from the winehq repositories?
[05:17] <php-freak> I'm starting to like linux more everyday once I figure it out
[05:17] <php-freak> just need to get my sound card working, and ill be on my way
[05:18] <chable> back
[05:18] <jerp> yakumo, did you find the way to get your desktop icons to vanish?

[05:20] <hydrox> Hello?
[05:20] <php-freak> yea, well I didn't know there was this many desktops cause i don't really like the one I got right now, but I see theres a lot more to linux then just this desktop.
[05:20] <hume> php-freak, :)
[05:20] <php-freak> I'll tell you what I've been having a heck of a time trying to get my sound card working
[05:20] <hydrox> I had a question about a problem I'm having, if anyone minds helping out?
[05:21] <php-freak> brb guys its finished unpackking
[05:21] <hume> hydrox, what problem?
[05:22] <GK> hello - I have posted a query on ubuntu CD - could some one give some light on that
[05:22] <hydrox> hume, When I try and boot the 2.6 kernel, it just stops, i don't know how to make it output anything with verbosity, so even that will help. 2.4 kernel boots but dosen't have support for the SATA harddrive I have. I'm using an official disk, too, and it happens with every single Linux i've tryed
[05:23] <hume> hydrox, whats the exact point it stops, and do you have any error msgs?
[05:23] <minimec> Bakefy: http://www.mp3-converter.com/linux/index.htm
[05:23] <hydrox> it decompresses fine, and when it says "booting kernel..." it just freezes, no messages
[05:23] <hume> hydrox, is there any data in /var/log/syslog that tells about it, that is, where it stops booting the 2.6 kernel?
[05:23] <Bakefy> minimec, you rock
[05:23] <tim167> can anyone help me make a DVD from an avi ?
[05:24] <hume> hydrox, ubuntu regular kernel? right architecture?
[05:24] <hydrox> hume, It's booting off the CD, so i can't check any logs
[05:24] <hume> hydrox, are you sure the CD is OK? Tried booting it on another machine?
[05:24] <hydrox> Yeah, right architecture, i tryed both x86 and the 64bit one [my CPU supports both..well, it's ment to :P] , I've been using Linux for 3years, it's just a new computer, and a big problem with not much information :P
[05:25] <hydrox> yeah, the CD is okay
[05:25] <hydrox> I have about 7 Ubuntu ones, it has the same problem with my Debian ones too
[05:25] <Journeyman> I have a fresh install of ubuntu 6.10, I can't see any of the orange progess bars in gnome any idea what causes that?
[05:25] <hume> hydrox, you mean that the same thing happens with the computer if you boot off a debian CD with 2.6 kernel?
[05:26] <hydrox> Yeah, sorrie. Cold hands so my typing is screwy and i'm not explaining well
[05:26] <minimec> Journeyman: Did you change the theme?
[05:26] <Journeyman> no
[05:26] <yuv656> anyone know how to get twinview working?
[05:26] <minimec> Journeyman: hmmm...
[05:26] <yuv656> i tried 2 howtos from ubuntu forums, neither worked for me
[05:27] <Journeyman> ah maybe it is a theme issue
[05:27] <hume> hydrox, in that case there must be something with this particular kernel version and your computer, strange. can you try with other 2.6 kernels and see if they boot?
[05:27] <LjL> psusi: if i decided to try defrag on my root partition, would having it mounted read-only suffice, or must it not be mounted at all?
[05:27] <minimec> Journeyman: Well it could be, because depending on the theme you have, the colors of the progress bar is different.
[05:28] <Journeyman> minimec the thing is I don't get any color
[05:28] <Journeyman> nothing is there
[05:28] <yuv656> !twinview
[05:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about twinview - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:28] <Journeyman> how would I reinstall the theme
=== beuno is now known as No_Beuno
[05:28] <yakumo> bye for now got to figure out how to fix my new install 6.10
[05:28] <hydrox> I don't really want to deviate from Debian/Ubuntu kernels. It's older versions of the kernel have trouble too. Old debian, latest debian, x86, 64bit, old ubuntu, new ubuntu, all the same problem, all diffurent versions of the 2.6 kernel
[05:28] <minimec> Journeyman: Try to play around a little bit witih the gnome-theme-manager
=== ttyfscker_ is now known as ttyfscker
[05:29] <Journeyman> minimec, yeah I am, when I do other themes I can get the bar
[05:29] <nubbe> is there an easy way to generate or get a list of artist, song, filename when doing an audio-cd with K3B?
[05:29] <Journeyman> how can one download the theme again and reinstall it
[05:29] <hume> hydrox, got to go have dinner, but I'm afraid I dont know about that. I'd try to install with 2.4-kernel and then install a  number of 2.6-kernels and check the logs
[05:29] <minimec> Journeyman: Go to gnome-look.org and look for 'Human'
[05:30] <Journeyman> thanks
[05:30] <minimec> np
[05:30] <hydrox> hume, I guess, but SATA harddrive, so I can't. Thank anyway :)
[05:30] <paolo> Hi: i need that kubuntu automounts a cd-rom, after instering it: is it possible?
[05:30] <hume> hydrox, what do you mean you cant? no support for sata in 2.4?
[05:30] <hydrox> hume, Yeah, as far as I know, and I can't really change the 2.4 kernel if there is
[05:31] <hume> hydrox, try asking in debian channel as well - must be someone else having that problem
[05:31] <hume> hydrox, good luck..:)
[05:31] <s0nix> Hi, im searching some who can send me a file to repair my broken system..... the file /lib/libpthread.2.4.... for 64bits system.

[05:42] <salah> which version of the kernel should I have when the CPU model is "AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3000+"?
[05:42] <reverseblade> IceTox, send an email to the manufacturer. So that they will now there are +1 linux users
[05:42] <reverseblade> probably they will ignore it but still it makes sense in the long run
[05:42] <reverseblade> K7
[05:42] <atlef> salah : generic
[05:42] <IceTox> I will do reverseblade :)
[05:43] <hydrox> salah, The one that has "64" written somewhere in it, or i386 if you can't find that
[05:43] <salah> atlef, hvorfor generic?
[05:43] <boink> what's the ubuntu notepad called?
[05:43] <reverseblade> boink, gedit

[05:44] <boink> (huhuhhu) .. don't do that
[05:44] <mo> reverseblade, thanks!

[05:45] <blackflare> does anyone have any thoughts why my usb keyboard wont do a held keypress? It registers each key but wont keep repeating it when held down
[05:45] <mo> reverseblade, what does "-9" mean?
[05:45] <reverseblade> mo, man killall
[05:45] <mnoir> mo: it means 'now, no nonsense'
[05:46] <mo> ok, thx :)
[05:46] <mnoir> only use it when absolutely needed
[05:46] <psusi> generally to be avoided unless the program is hung and won't respond to the normal kill
[05:46] <reverseblade> mnoir, mostly you will have to use it with wine programs

[05:47] <reverseblade> wjbaird, kidding of course
[05:48] <protocol1> is there a way I can increase my swap size
[05:48] <reverseblade> L0cKd0wN, pgrep sshd , ps aux |grep sshd or ps -ef | grep sshd

[05:48] <atlef> i know
[05:48] <L0cKd0wN2> so no 'service' in ubuntu?
[05:48] <protocol1> I mean virtual memory
[05:48] <L0cKd0wN2> like service sshd status
[05:48] <L0cKd0wN2> ;(
[05:48] <mo> mnoir, thank you. i needed it because java needed 196% cpu (searching for null) ;)
[05:48] <LjL> psusi, ping
[05:48] <reverseblade> L0cKd0wN, serivces are a called daemons in linux sshd is a daemon.
[05:49] <wjbaird> I upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 on the weekend, and I'm getting weird xinerama behavior with metacity --- it won't let me drag windows completely off my primary display...  I've switched to xfwm4 temporarily, but I'd rather figure out how to fix metacity.   It was working fine in 6.06...

[05:50] <psusi> LjL: pong
[05:50] <LjL> psusi: if i decided to try defrag on my root partition, would having it mounted read-only suffice, or must it not be mounted at all?

[05:50] <IceTox> yeah, sorry about that L0cKd0wN :)
[05:50] <psusi> LjL: it must not be mounted at all
[05:50] <L0cKd0wN2> :P
[05:50] <ThePub> wjbaird: xserver driver?  any other apparent issues?  do you see the window appear on the other screen?
[05:51] <psusi> LjL: think about it... defrag is moving stuff around out from under the kernel... it would get very pissed off when things arne't where it expects them to be
[05:51] <Al-Daja> how can i configure an wireless internet?
[05:51] <wjbaird> ThePub: I don't think it's an X issue - using xfwm4 everything seems fine...
[05:51] <LjL> psusi: that was why i asked in the first place. on the other hand, you have other filesystems such as NTFS that can even be defragmented online, with everything mounted r/w, so the question kind of made sense to me ;-)
[05:52] <ThePub> wjbaird: ok, great.  hope you can fix it.
[05:52] <IceTox> defrysk: http://rafb.net/paste/results/ChCiZL90.html <-- Can you please have a looka t this? :)
[05:52] <psusi> LjL: that isn't done by directly manipulating blocks... the filesystem supports ioctls to move the files around
[05:52] <Al-Daja> how can i configure an wireless internet?
[05:52] <reverseblade> !wireless | Al-Daja
[05:52] <ubotu> Al-Daja: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:53] <defrysk> IceTox, it only works on windows
[05:53] <Abd_Samy> hello all
[05:53] <boink> Al-Daja: you mean your wireless card?
[05:53] <psusi> LjL: so the filesystem moves the blocks when it is good and ready, and knows where they are at all times... of course, this slows things down and bloats the filesystem code...
[05:53] <Abd_Samy> guys can anyone tell me how i can install ubuntu from a hard disk
[05:53] <Al-Daja> wireless usb linked to a router linked to a modem to be more specific boink
[05:53] <boink> depends on which usb-think you have there.
[05:53] <psusi> Abd_Samy: from a hard disk?
[05:53] <Abd_Samy> yeah
[05:54] <boink> not all wireless cards work with the linux kernel
[05:54] <Al-Daja> boink define
[05:54] <Al-Daja> smc heard about?
[05:54] <boink> which chip does your usb-thing have?
[05:54] <LjL> psusi: which wouldn't matter to much if the FS were in userland *cough* anyway, offtopic discussions aside - i'm also interested in knowing (in plaintext) what you had to do in order to make defrag ext3 compatible
[05:54] <boink> smc ... that's Chinese.
[05:54] <reverseblade> boink, but there is always ndiswrapper for rescuing
[05:54] <boink> I've used their routers before
[05:54] <boink> sure
[05:54] <cyberjunkie> hahaha IceTox
[05:54] <IceTox> defrysk: that sucks - doesn't it? :| You sure I cannot make it through using wine? =)
[05:55] <psusi> LjL: see the changelog
[05:55] <defrysk> IceTox, dunno google for it if its possible
[05:55] <cyberjunkie> wait is that sarcasm!
[05:55] <Abd_Samy> how can i do that
[05:55] <eichi> hello, how can i change the manpage language in ubuntu?
[05:55] <pos69sum> hi
[05:56] <Al-Daja> boink any idea?
[05:56] <IceTox> cyberjunkie: if you reffered to me, I did not mean to be sarcastic at all..
[05:56] <pos69sum> i went from dapper to edgy - and now i can't run update-manager.  when i start it up, i get various python errors.
[05:56] <LjL> eichi: uhm, i'm not sure the manpages are very translated...
[05:56] <reverseblade> eichi, uh oh, AFAIK you cant
[05:56] <pos69sum> i've tried reinstalling it and ubuntu-desktop via synaptic, but that doesn't work
[05:56] <cyberjunkie> isnt that a cd image, how do you expect it to run like that :P
[05:57] <psusi> LjL: basically I just shut off the patch that was in there that specifically refused to work on ext3... and made another patch to fix a bug that caused it to hose up the journal inode ( and any other reserved inodes )
[05:57] <eichi> reverseblade: realy?
[05:57] <Abd_Samy> how i can install ubuntu from HARD-DESK
[05:57] <Bollinger> can someone tell me how update-java-alternatives determines the list of java VMs installed? (I looked at the script and dont understant)
[05:57] <reverseblade> pos69sum, unfortunately some issues reported with that upgrade process
[05:57] <psusi> Abd_Samy: what do you mean?
[05:57] <pos69sum> so, does this mean i should reinstall?  or should i wait for a patch
[05:57] <reverseblade> eichi, yes, but you can have your help pages translated. man is technical
[05:57] <IceTox> cyberjunkie: because I'm a newbie and tried what I was told to do :/
[05:58] <eichi> reverseblade: how?
[05:58] <cyberjunkie> ah :< you use windwos usually i guess.. .bin / .iso / .nrg etc etc :P
[05:58] <reverseblade> pos69sum, dig it, may be there is a solution for it. But if not, don't be surprised
[05:58] <cyberjunkie> you know what im saying right?
[05:58] <atlef> IceTox : so you were told to steal cm07, and come here for help?
[05:58] <mahdi> hi, could anybody help me plz? I'm running feisty and when i hibernate/suspend and then resume i get only a blank screen... what could b wrong? The suspend/hibernate procedures seems to b right, resuming is what i think is wrong
[05:58] <reverseblade> !fiesty | mahdi
[05:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fiesty - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:59] <pos69sum> i have been looking for a day now.  i've posted on the forums too, nothing.
[05:59] <Abd_Samy> i have ubuntu edgy cd in my hard okay and i havnt CD-Rom to put it there coz that i wanna know how i can install ubuntu direct from hard-disk
[05:59] <Al-Daja> any way to i know what are the wireless usb compatible to ubuntu?
[05:59] <reverseblade> mahdi, try #ubuntu+1
[05:59] <reverseblade> Al-Daja, google
[05:59] <eichi> reverseblade: I mean the --help textes ;) because for examle adduser --help is very bad in german, my friend likes to prefer english then
[05:59] <mahdi> reverseblade:  ok. Tkz
[05:59] <psusi> Abd_Samy: are you currently running windows on the hard disk?
[05:59] <Abd_Samy> yeah
[05:59] <psusi> Abd_Samy: if so, then you can't... you have to boot from the cd
[05:59] <eichi> Abd_Samy: there is no wy i think
[06:00] <IceTox> lol atlef.. As I have the real copy on a cd at home, I'm not sure I'm doing that much illegal. This is just my work computer and I wanted to play some cm tonight. that's all :)
[06:00] <reverseblade> eichi, contact the translators then. I don't know
[06:00] <L0cKd0wN2> network installation...
[06:00] <reverseblade> eichi, AFAIK man pages have no translations
[06:00] <Zoohouse> Hello everyone
[06:00] <Abd_Samy> but i think i read i can do that but i dont remember where i read it
[06:00] <mahdi> reverseblade: i had this problem with edgy too
[06:00] <atlef> IceTox : ok, but it said RELOADED at the end.............
[06:00] <atlef> IceTox : so
[06:00] <Abd_Samy> by the way thank u
[06:00] <DouchePirate> 	x)
[06:00] <LjL> psusi: so again, if i tried it on a real partition such as my root partition, is there anything you'd be specifically interested in having me check out?
[06:00] <reverseblade> mahdi, then re ask your question as if it happens in edgy
[06:00] <Zoohouse> I having a little problem removing a key from gpg.. Here is what I am doing with the the error message: http://www.shortText.com/3hy31
[06:00] <Zoohouse> 
[06:01] <mahdi> hi, could anybody help me plz? I'm running edgy and when i hibernate/suspend and then resume i get only a blank screen... what could b wrong? The suspend/hibernate procedures seems to b right, resuming is what i think is wrong.
[06:01] <Abd_Samy> i'll searching now if i found it i'll tell u
[06:01] <psusi> LjL: other than it NOT eating your filesystem for lunch? ;)
[06:01] <Abd_Samy> thanx
[06:01] <eichi> reverseblade: i dont mean the manpages..i want so change the application language then
[06:01] <hydrox> Abd_Samy, Hey, I know
[06:01] <Abd_Samy> really how
[06:01] <Abd_Samy> >
[06:01] <reverseblade> mahdi, this is a hardware specific issue. Search the forums and google, if some one with the same hardware succeded with the hibernate.
[06:01] <hydrox> Abd_Samy, If you use VMware to install from the ISO image, in a virtual machine, and then DD that image to a harddrive partition, it should work
[06:01] <IceTox> atlas: yes, it does, but I do have the bought version as well.
[06:02] <reverseblade> eichi, you can do it while you are loggin in. In the splash screen there's a options thing. I think you can set the language from there
[06:02] <atlef> IceTox : ok
[06:02] <LjL> psusi: yeah, other than that. i suppose i'm going to check that one by doing a "find / some-options-to-print-all-file-attributes" and a full run of md5sum before and after the defrag
[06:02] <L0cKd0wN2> if he has another box with a cd drive, he could also do a network installation, but he'll need to build a small LAN for that
[06:03] <psusi> LjL: that would be good... as well as a fsck -f before and after the defrag
[06:03] <Abd_Samy> okay
[06:03] <Abd_Samy> thanx i'll try it
[06:03] <L0cKd0wN2> just an idea Abd_Samy  ;)
[06:03] <LjL> psusi: but besides that, i can time the defrag, and perhaps do some before/after benchmarking as well, possibly in a smarter way than just timing the md5sum time
[06:03] <atlef> IceTox : i can't help you anyway, don't know wine at all
[06:03] <hydrox> Abd_Samy, Same here, but it shoulden't take longer than about 10 minutes of interaction to do
[06:03] <Abd_Samy> <hydrox> thanx
[06:03] <psusi> LjL: also you might play with the buffer parameter to use more ram... could speed it up
[06:04] <psusi> LjL: it used to use only 2 MB of ram ( it was written when a 4 MB machine was a beast )... I boosted it to 32 MB... more could be better
[06:04] <sercik_> can you read me?
[06:04] <LjL> psusi: i also assume the fragmentation data before running defrag would be useful to know. so is there something i might run to get some interesting data besides defrag itself with the relevant show-me-the-fragmentation-data option?
[06:04] <Abd_Samy> loool i'll try hydrox
[06:04] <LjL> sercik_: no
[06:04] <hydrox> Abd_Samy, Awesome, tell me how it goes :)
[06:04] <sercik_> i have configured kopete
[06:04] <Abd_Samy> okay

[06:07] <pos69sum> are you able to post to ubuntu-users from gmail?
[06:07] <blackflare> damnit. tvtime was working perfectly, I rebooted and now it says "format unsupported by creative nx" cannot open capture device /dev/video0
[06:07] <pos69sum> i have submitted a couple emails and it looks like they are never posted
[06:07] <M3G4crux> can you tell it to me reverseblade
[06:08] <reverseblade> M3G4crux, no, I am gonna leave now sorry
[06:08] <M3G4crux> just tell me if you used vga or vesafb in the boot
[06:08] <reverseblade> M3G4crux, what boot parameter anyway? I am have installed it standard way and never touched anything
[06:08] <reverseblade> M3G4crux, how to check it ?
[06:08] <ismail> guys im going to buy a vedeo card with in the next few days and im wondering whats the most compatible card i can get?

[06:09] <ismail> hmmm
[06:09] <sercik_> ciao
[06:09] <ismail> would the nvidia fx400 128mb work well with beryl?
[06:09] <L0cKd0wN2> support under linux tends to be better versus ati, but that's an off-topic question ;)
[06:09] <reverseblade> M3G4crux, nothing
[06:09] <M3G4crux> grep video or grep vga will do
[06:09] <M3G4crux> in the same file
[06:10] <L0cKd0wN2> haven't used beryl, let alone under ubuntu, so I can't say
[06:10] <Journeyman> how do I change the icon in the applications menu
[06:11] <ismail> im looking at the fx400 and the fx5200 cause it mentions that that it supports open gl
[06:11] <reverseblade> M3G4crux, ok checking it
[06:11] <M3G4crux> thank you so much reverseblade
[06:11] <L0cKd0wN2> ismail, if I were you, i'd wait on purchasing a card, and wait for dx10 support.... but that's me
[06:11] <ismail> directx 10...
[06:11] <M3G4crux> ismail, wow that has to be nice
[06:11] <reverseblade> M3G4crux, nothing at all
[06:12] <M3G4crux> huh weird
[06:12] <L0cKd0wN2> and this old 600mhz box im on, supports opengl... that should be pretty much standard

[06:14] <ismail> or will i need extra config in the terminal?
[06:15] <L0cKd0wN2> ismail, there are packages available, but it might take some config
[06:15] <L0cKd0wN2> it's linux... sometimes you gotta tinker and config... lol
[06:15] <ismail> hmmm ok i guess i'lljust read the wiki in ubuntu
[06:16] <L0cKd0wN2> sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common

[06:21] <pablo> hi, which are ubuntu recommended system requirements?
[06:21] <tenshu> I'm looking for a Point Of Sale management software for a small shop. Is anyone tries one and would recommand it
[06:21] <soppman> yo
[06:21] <soppman> how do i start another x server?
[06:21] <chable> how do i disable warnings ?
[06:21] <nubbe> L0cKd0wN, I'd also like to turn it off when I don't need it :)
[06:21] <ubun> how do you run 'identd' with irssi?
[06:22] <Journeyman> install oidentd
[06:22] <chable> brb
[06:22] <L0cKd0wN2> nubbe, sounds like something you'll need to code
[06:22] <L0cKd0wN2> nothing like that exists to my knowledge
[06:22] <pablo> hi, which are ubuntu recommended system requirements?
[06:22] <nn> ubun: apt-get install slidentd
[06:22] <L0cKd0wN2> how's ur C? :P
[06:23] <ismail> tenshu: try grisbi
[06:23] <pos69sum> after an update to edgy, i can't run update-manager.  i get python errors.  i've tried to reinstall update-manager via synaptic, didn't fix it.
[06:23] <pos69sum> should i try to clear my package db?
[06:23] <nubbe> L0cKd0wN, I was hoping something like tomboy or such, not good enough :( ...
[06:23] <ubun> well which identd is it :P oidentd or slidentd
[06:23] <nn> tenshu: I write POS software, but its very not cheap...
[06:24] <tenshu> ismail: grisbi is for accounting i'm looking for something wich could handle a cashier and a small stock
[06:24] <L0cKd0wN2> nubbe, yea but you want functionality that interacts with the GUI, you'll need to use the gtk probably to achieve what you want
[06:24] <ubun> piece of s software?
[06:24] <ubun> me too
[06:24] <nn> point of sale
[06:24] <ismail> ooooow
[06:24] <ismail> oki
[06:24] <ismail> sorry
[06:24] <tenshu> nn: whats the name?
[06:24] <ubun> oh, then not me too :p
[06:24] <LjL> psusi: so how does this sound? time fsck -f -v ; time ls -Ral > ls-before.out ; time md5deep -r > md5-before.out ; frag > frag.out ; time defrag -r -n -v ; time defrag -n -v ; time fsck -f -v ; time ls -Ral >ls-after.out ; time md5deep -r > md5-after.out ; diff ls-before.out ls-after.out ; diff md5-before.out mf5-after.out
[06:25] <nn> tenshu: kewiPOS is our software, but it's honestly very overpriced
[06:25] <MystaMax> is samba the solution I'm looking for if I want to back up a ubuntu-server directly to a windows server??
[06:25] <nubbe> L0cKd0wN, would be fine if it works with nano or some other text-only editor
=== wine_ is now known as winex
[06:26] <tenshu> thanks nn, nobody knows a cheap/free POS manager?
[06:26] <cld2> is it possible to rotate one of my desktops in gnome?
[06:26] <ExxKA> MystaMax why not do it through ftp?
[06:26] <kane77> hi all
[06:26] <ExxKA> hey kane77
[06:26] <kane77> how do I turn on the wlan on laptop in ubuntu??
[06:26] <MystaMax> ExxKA, theres no ftp server on the windows server. I'm limited to win shares.
[06:26] <MystaMax> !wlan
[06:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wlan - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:26] <L0cKd0wN2> nubbe, well when you select code in the terminal, that data goes into a memory block, you could probably use bash scripting to access that memory block, then write some routines to store in a file name you create
[06:27] <nn> MystaMax: ftp server on the linux box :P
[06:27] <nubbe> L0cKd0wN, I heard emacs does everything... ;)
[06:27] <L0cKd0wN2> nubbe, going terminal only definitely reduces complexity
[06:27] <ubun> !python
[06:27] <Narada> guys; i just installed java6 but how do i get update-alternatives to notice that there is a new java?
[06:27] <ubotu> python: An interactive high-level object-oriented language (default version). In component main, is important. Version 2.4.3-11ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 37 kB, installed size 208 kB
[06:27] <ExxKA> MystaMax, okay.. It's just that i don't believe samba has resume support, and did you consider what file system you are using on the m$?
=== Guest1843 is now known as ruth___
[06:28] <nn> MystaMax: my recommendation is just do a tar of the ubuntu box and pull it via ftp to windows

[06:28] <nubbe> bye
[06:28] <L0cKd0wN2> nubbe, hehe np, sounds kinda like fun, cya
[06:28] <nn> MystaMax: of course, if you use samba anyways, you can set it all up so that the tarball is stored directly on a share on the doze box

[06:28] <MystaMax> ExxKA, I'll be using ntfs. i really just need the /var/www/ directory and my mysql dbs. I'm not familiar with resume
[06:29] <L0cKd0wN2> enough with the bot!
[06:29] <L0cKd0wN2> geez!
[06:29] <boink> I couldn't get mongrel installed on ubuntu dapper
[06:29] <MystaMax> nn, thats what i'm trying to do
[06:29] <L0cKd0wN2> google ffs
[06:29] <MystaMax> nn, tar the directory and then just copy to a winbox and have it backed up by BackupExec
[06:29] <ExxKA> MystaMax, resume just means that if a problem occurs with the transfer, the protocol know it should pick up where it left, and not start the transfer over
[06:29] <welly> hey all.. is it possible to do a network install of ubuntu 6.10?
[06:30] <MystaMax> ExxKA, ahh I gotcha

[06:32] <welly> L0cKd0wN, hmm.. want to install it from an os x machine, can't seem to find much info about doing that
[06:32] <ismail> ooow
[06:32] <ismail> i had a pci lifeview
[06:32] <MystaMax> ExxKA, nn, so would setting up samba and using rsync work? doesn't rsync support resume?
[06:32] <ismail> it worked like a charm in suse
[06:32] <nn> MystaMax: mount the smb share from windows someplace, tar jcvf /path/to/share/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%m).tar.bz2 /var/www /your-backup-of-dbs
[06:32] <Patr|ck> ismail: what was the software you used?
[06:32] <ismail> havent tried it in ubuntu
[06:32] <nn> MystaMax: isn't an rsync server
[06:33] <Xzyx987X> hey, how do you manually add a service to gnome's service manager?
[06:33] <leny> Patr|ck: I have a Hauppauge Win-TV HVR 900 USN running on Edgy with gxine and xine-lib recompiled at latest levels
[06:33] <L0cKd0wN2> welly, you'll need ftp, http, and dhcp server, and obviously a copy of the ubuntu installation .iso
[06:33] <ismail> patric. i cant remember it was just called tv i got it off the suse repo
[06:33] <welly> L0cKd0wN, ok.. i shouuld have all that

[06:34] <ismail> but the rule in suse is as i remember is that usb periferals work better than pci
[06:34] <MystaMax> nn, I have virtual machine ready to become a mediator. it'll serve as the rsync server for the production web server, and have samba setup with a mounted windows share? Does that sound good?

[06:38] <kasper1990> Hi I was wondering If anyone knows a way to add a virtual PDF printer so everywhere in Ubuntu where it is possible to print out on paper, it is also possible to save as a PDF? This is possible natively when using OS X, and can be done with PDFCreator for Windows, but I haven't found out how to do so in Linux yet.

[06:46] <blackflare> I need this webcam driver and its only available as source
[06:46] <cntb> I think you will finally succeed
[06:46] <biotrox> balckfare | read README/INSTALL file
[06:47] <cntb> why stick to abit ?
[06:47] <blackflare> ok
[06:47] <AlexC_> I have managed to sort of install Arch Linux - but I have no install guides for it - but that's given me hope that I know Linux _will_ install
[06:47] <AlexC_> Just Ubuntu fails to find my CD Drive
[06:47] <AlexC_> says I have to load extra CD modules, but I tried all of them and non worked
[06:47] <KenSentMe> I try to run the command sysinfo, but i get this error: *** stack smashing detected ***: sysinfo terminated. Anyone know a solution or another way to get system info?
[06:48] <cntb> install disk boots ? AlexC_ ?
[06:48] <AlexC_> cntb: the Alternate does, but the Desktop CD just locks up when loading ( the progress bar stops )
[06:49] <ubun> what kind of system info? uname, /proc/*
[06:49] <AlexC_> cntb: it also locks up if I go "check CD for defects" ( or what ever it is )
[06:49] <cntb> then it is pure hardware problem
[06:49] <cntb> CD drive is not expensive . also clean it
[06:50] <AlexC_> cntb: I'm going to see if I can find an old CD Drive around somewhere
[06:50] <ismail> try usin a live cd
[06:50] <cntb> relianle hardware is essential
[06:50] <AlexC_> cntb: I just pray to god it works! I hope I havn't wasted 150 for something that wont work =(
[06:50] <ubun> did you buy it on ebay?
[06:51] <ubun> my router arrived DOA :(
[06:51] <cntb> 150 was for MB CPU MEM ?
[06:51] <ismail> buy what
[06:51] <ismail> ?
[06:51] <AlexC_> cntb: no - jsut the motherboard,
[06:51] <kasper1990> exit
[06:51] <cntb> OK
[06:51] <AlexC_> I brought the motherboard because my old one, Abit AB9 would not let me install Ubuntu ( JMicron problems ) ubun - no, from an online store I always buy from
[06:51] <cntb> AlexC_,  is it warranty replacemnet ? no new buy is covered by 3 yrs warranty right ?
[06:52] <ismail> whats an abit?
[06:52] <cntb> not a big problem AlexC_ . see ?
[06:52] <AlexC_> cntb: hum? I don't understand
[06:52] <AlexC_> I can't send my Abit AB9 back because there is nothing wrong with it
[06:52] <wedemandoblivion> hey, I just started with ubuntu, and I can't figure out if there's a way to force quit troublesome applications. can anyone help me out?
[06:52] <AlexC_> instead I am going to sell my Abit AB9 and I have just brought a Abit AW9D
[06:52] <cntb> your MB must have its 3yrs warranty
[06:53] <AlexC_> cntb: it most probably does, but there is nothing wrong with my motherboard - so they wont except it
[06:53] <cntb> exactly my point AlexC_ . pls stop complaining about  150 wasted
[06:53] <ismail> AlwxC: wjays an Abit A89
[06:53] <cntb> find your problem and be happy
[06:53] <ismail> whats
[06:53] <AlexC_> cntb: I'm not understanding
[06:54] <cntb> your new board does not seem to be the problem. period
[06:54] <AlexC_> I sure hope not :P
[06:54] <cntb> ok you are losing me here
[06:54] <cntb> good luck

[06:55] <Samus_Aran> how do I stop Ubuntu from rotating my logs all the time ?
[06:55] <Samus_Aran> I just want them to sit there and get larger.
[06:55] <Rookie_> logrotate
[06:55] <rm_you> Does anyone know where the settings are for changing the way certain windows are decorated in Gnome?
[06:55] <Samus_Aran> Rookie_: logrotate is what rotates them.  I want it to stop
[06:55] <atlef> AlexC_ : tried different bootparameters?
[06:55] <AlexC_> atlef: how do I do that?
[06:56] <Samus_Aran> rm_you: why only certain windows ?
[06:56] <ismail> look in the themes menue
[06:56] <rm_you> Samus_Aran: I need to disable decorations on a window so it looks fullscreen when maximized
[06:56] <ubu>  ubuntu-se-mote
[06:56] <rm_you> Samus_Aran: I know I did it before using pattern matching and I remember what the settings page looked like, I just dont remember how to get there
[06:56] <kane77> how do i turn on wlan on a laptop??
[06:57] <Samus_Aran> rm_you: ah.  I use ICEWM here, and I just go Alt+Enter to fullscreen any app (remove its decorations).  I don't know anything about doing such in Gnome, though, sorry
[06:57] <atlef> AlexC_ : hit F6 at fhe boot prompt, when you boot the cd/dvd and append noapic to the end of that line
[06:57] <dinamizador> hola
[06:57] <AlexC_> atlef: noapic ... ok, let me go try that!
[06:57] <atlef> AlexC_ : just an example
[06:58] <AlexC_> atlef: are there any others I could try?

[06:58] <Crescendo_> I'm trying to connect to my VNC server, and I'm getting this: ReadFromRFBServer: rdr::SystemException: read: Connection reset by peer (104) - how can I fix it? I've got the right port forwarded, and an nmap of the machine shows the port as listening
[06:58] <atlef> AlexC_ : one sec
[06:58] <AlexC_> ok
[06:58] <Samus_Aran> Crescendo_: can you connect to it from localhost ?
[06:58] <Crescendo_> Samus_Aran, I think F11 fullscreens most apps.
[06:58] <Crescendo_> Samus_Aran, I'm not sure, I'm sshing into it.
[06:59] <Samus_Aran> Crescendo_: and which VNC server are you using ?
[06:59] <WizCraker> i'm trying to compile something and it keeps giving me an error of no Terminal Library found:  You need to install a terminal library.  which terminal library do I install?
[06:59] <Crescendo_> Samus_Aran, whatever was in the repositories.  I'll have to check.
[06:59] <Samus_Aran> Crescendo_: if you're SSHing from a computer with X, then use ssh -X and then just do the command: vncviewer localhost:0
[07:00] <Samus_Aran> Crescendo_: for example there is x11vnc which uses the real VNC server, TightVNC that offers better compression, and that standard AT&T VNC server which is pretty basic
[07:00] <Samus_Aran> er, real X11 server
[07:00] <CarlFK> what do I apt-get install to get http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/python/python2.5  ?
[07:00] <Samus_Aran> (like the Win32 version of VNC)
[07:01] <Samus_Aran> CarlFK: are you on Edgy ?
[07:01] <Crescendo_> Samus_Aran, vncviewer: ConnectToTcpAddr: connect: Connection refused
[07:01] <Crescendo_> Unable to connect to VNC server

[07:01] <neruatix> is aptitude the new loud?
[07:01] <Samus_Aran> CarlFK: then it should just be: apt-get install python
[07:01] <Samus_Aran> neruatix: the new loud ?
[07:01] <Samus_Aran> though I find the interface has gotten worse over time
[07:01] <OmegaMan03> Hi, Edgy Eft, I changed my samba -> open with to application/x-desktop and I can't seem to change it back.  I looked in /usr/share/applications and found nothing
[07:01] <CarlFK> Samus_Aran: that got me Python 2.4.3
[07:02] <neruatix> shall i use aptitude instead of apt-get ? *
[07:02] <AlexC_> atlef: I shall go try that, if it doesn't work I'll be back
[07:02] <Winball> So, I bought a new Ati gfx card. But ubuntu can't boot right because it's installed nvidia drivers. Now im on my old gfxcard. How can I remove the nvidia driver and install ati drivers?
[07:02] <M0E^lnx> is there a way to choose between grub and LILO during the edgy install?
=== r3x__ is now known as r3x
[07:03] <atlef> AlexC_ : ok
[07:03] <Samus_Aran> CarlFK: perhaps "apt-get install python2.5", though I only see documentation for python2.5 on my apt-cache search
[07:03] <leny> CarlFK: Aptitude shows a package python2.5 try sudo apt-get install python2.5
[07:03] <dfwlinuxguy> winball...use synaptic to search for fglrx and install that
[07:03] <Samus_Aran> CarlFK: oh wait, it is there.  so just add the 2.5
[07:03] <dfwlinuxguy> then do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:03] <Winball> dfwlinuxguy will that remove the nvidia drivers?
[07:03] <Dial_tone> you don't have to uninstall the nvidia driver
[07:04] <Dial_tone> just install ati and make sure that it's in xorg.conf
[07:04] <CarlFK> Winball: how did you install the nvidia driver ?
[07:04] <dfwlinuxguy> choose fglrx instead of ati
[07:04] <Winball> I guess with automatix
[07:04] <CarlFK> E: Couldn't find package python2.5
[07:04] <CarlFK>  apt-cache search python2.5 = nothing
[07:04] <Samus_Aran> Crescendo_: well stop the VNC server and run it from an active SSH session so you can see the messages that appear as you connect, and as it starts up.  it is probably misconfigured
[07:04] <Winball> It seems like the xserver-xorg-video-ati package is installed

[07:05] <higir> what is the best download manager for ubuntu?
[07:05] <Crescendo_> Samus_Aran, on Fedora that's "service vncserver stop" - how is it done on Ubuntu?
[07:05] <Dial_tone> define 'best'
[07:06] <Samus_Aran> dfwlinuxguy: do you happen to know if Beryl/XGL require Gnome to work, or if they can function in other standalone window managers like ICEWM ?
[07:06] <dfwlinuxguy> for python? no..please...one second
[07:06] <Samus_Aran> Crescendo_: that depends on how you started the service
[07:06] <higir> mmm.. a download manager in which i can download files faster, or the one that is more popular
[07:06] <CarlFK> apt-cache search python|grep 5 - no py2.5 ...
[07:06] <Samus_Aran> Crescendo_: the two ways I know to do vnc servers are through [x] inetd, or manually start it with "vncserver"
[07:06] <OmegaMan03> Try /etc/init.d/vncserver stop
[07:06] <Samus_Aran> CarlFK: apt-get update
[07:06] <dfwlinuxguy> http://ubuntufreak.blogspot.com/ has some good info on setting it up...should work with others besides gnome
[07:07] <Dial_tone> gwget
[07:07] <higir> pok thanks

[07:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about C++ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:08] <Samus_Aran> Vixus: you could try passing the kernel the "boot=/sbin/passwd username" parameter, or boot using the LiveCD and run the command: sudo passwd username
[07:08] <adaptr> M0E^lnx: /boot/grub/grub.conf

[07:10] <biotrox> c u guys
[07:10] <dfwlinuxguy> carlfk yes it does
[07:10] <M0E^lnx> do I need to run anything after modifiying grub.conf? like in lilo you have to run lilo?
[07:10] <pos69sum> i've tried sending mail from gmail twice
[07:10] <Vixus> no
[07:10] <pos69sum> no?
[07:10] <dfwlinuxguy> carlfk...you might need to modify your sources
[07:10] <Samus_Aran> LILO uses /etc/lilo.conf, GRUB uses /boot/grub/menu.lst, though GRUB's can be renamed any way you like
[07:10] <ismail> what does that mean
[07:10] <Vixus> How do I boot into textmode via grub??
[07:10] <ismail> sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[07:10] <nuki> why does my computer go to dos when i try to boot from live cd?
[07:10] <CarlFK> oh crap... dapper - I was sshed to my laptop....
[07:10] <Vixus> pos69sum: not you
[07:11] <M0E^lnx> but how do I make the new changes take effect?
[07:11] <CarlFK> sorry...
[07:11] <Crescendo_> Alright, fixed - now why isn't my password working?
[07:11] <adaptr> Vixus: edit the ubuntu startup menu while it boots and enter "single" at the end of the kernel= line to boot into single user mode - no password needed either
[07:11] <Dial_tone> you don't use grub to determine the runlevel
[07:11] <dfwlinuxguy> that would explain it
[07:11] <Samus_Aran> Vixus: pass the kernel the parameter "3" to boot into multiuser textmode, or "1" to boot into single user mode
[07:11] <pos69sum> can you email ubuntu-users from gmail?  i've sent two emails and they aren't going through
[07:11] <Vixus> adaptr: thanks.
[07:11] <nuki> can some one tell why does my computer go to dos when i try to boot from live cd?
[07:11] <nuki> please
[07:11] <OmegaMan03> Anyone know where else to look to change default applications besides /usr/share/applications?
[07:11] <CarlFK> nuki: define "go to dos"
[07:12] <adaptr> nuki: because you have DOS installed ?
[07:12] <Dial_tone> because your cd isn't bootable?
[07:12] <tonyyarusso> pos69sum: When I send messages (not gmail though) they just don't come back to my address - they make it to the list though
[07:12] <Samus_Aran> nuki: the text mode isn't DOS.  most likely it either can't detect your video card, or you have more than one video card and it gets confused
[07:12] <pos69sum> ok
[07:12] <dfwlinuxguy> /etc/default ? exactly what are you trying to do?

[07:23] <sharpfurniture> fyrestrtr, it's a trashlet
[07:23] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: but I'm curious, what are you doing that requires messing with /usr/src ?
[07:23] <dfwlinuxguy> eclipse is a great IDE for linux
[07:23] <Journeyman> oh /usr/src
[07:23] <Journeyman> hmm
[07:23] <blackflare> [13:21]  <blackflare> Im following a guide for compiling source, and it said to extract the tar there
[07:23] <dfwlinuxguy> it has plugins for just about any language
[07:23] <fyrestrtr> eclipse, komodo (non-free), monodevelop, gazpacho, idle, etc.
[07:23] <DShepherd> can anyone install gnomesword on ubuntu edgy?  I get some dependeny error
[07:23] <Journeyman> blackflare, you can't put it anywhere really, that is just a nice place to put your src files
[07:23] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: what guide?
[07:23] <blackflare> ohh
[07:24] <Journeyman> i normally extract them in my home file then delete it when I am done
[07:24] <blackflare> http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/#source
[07:24] <dfwlinuxguy> omegaman03...check in ~/.gconf/ directory for that setting
[07:24] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: no no no
[07:24] <fyrestrtr> !kernel | blackflare
[07:24] <ubotu> blackflare: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[07:24] <blackflare> huh?
[07:24] <nuki> ok i found out the real problem
[07:24] <blackflare> Im trying to compile a driver for my webcam
[07:24] <Journeyman> if he wants to compile his own kernel let him
[07:24] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild to find out how to *properly* get the source.
[07:24] <dfwlinuxguy> http://www.eclipse.org/
[07:25] <nuki> it loads caledra dr-dos, not ubuntu. why? it's an official cd
[07:25] <GeneralZarkawi> there is nothing wrong in compiling a custom kernel
[07:25] <Journeyman> fyrestrtr, linux is linux he can use any instructions to do it "properly"
[07:25] <fyrestrtr> there is the wrong way, the non-ubuntu way, and then the ubuntu way. Only one is guaranteed to work.
[07:25] <Journeyman> you don't have to follow the ubuntu guide
[07:25] <fyrestrtr> Journeyman: you'd think ;)
[07:25] <Journeyman> fyrestrtr, that is so much BS
[07:25] <GeneralZarkawi> fyrestrtr, what?
[07:25] <blackflare> Im just trying to do whatever is simplest to get my webcam working
[07:25] <GeneralZarkawi> fyrestrtr, there is nothing wrong in compiling the kernel following the instructions found in its README file
[07:25] <blackflare> I found a driver that says it will work, but its just source
[07:25] <fyrestrtr> Journeyman: but since he is (clearly) a newbie -- then its advisable to go with a proper ubuntu-guide.
[07:26] <Journeyman> sure it probably is better
[07:26] <Journeyman> and easier
[07:26] <Journeyman> but don't say that he can't do it
[07:26] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: are you sure its not available in the repos? Check !webcam
[07:26] <Journeyman> it would be fine to use any instructions
[07:26] <blackflare> I checked with synaptic and it only has source files...
[07:26] <nuki> please why does my computer load caledra dr-dos, not ubuntu. why? it's an official cd
[07:26] <niekie> !webcam
[07:26] <ubotu> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[07:26] <fyrestrtr> Journeyman: I'm just helping him out with the recommended ubuntu way, as this is an official support channel for ubuntu -- not general linux support (for that I join #linuxhelp)
[07:26] <niekie> Was interested in that too, heh.
[07:26] <Vixus> It didn't work, it still booted into GDM... I know what the problem is now. There's no output to the monitor but the sytem works as normal. I could login graphically even if i coldn't see anything. Still no text-mode login.
[07:26] <fyrestrtr> nuki: ah, you're back.
[07:27] <OmegaMan03> Thanks it was in a diff mimeinfo cache /home/jhafner/.local/share/applications
[07:27] <OmegaMan03> not defaults
[07:27] <nuki> unfortunately i'm back.. just need some info
[07:27] <blackflare> niekie thanks
[07:27] <fyrestrtr> nuki: go download an official iso from http://www.ubuntu.com/
[07:27] <blackflare> this looks easier
[07:27] <GeneralZarkawi> nuki, don't piss people off this time, thanks
[07:27] <BenFairlesss> Does anyone know how to get Ubuntu to run on a higher resolution than 1024x768, I need to run it in 1280x800
[07:27] <OmegaMan03> Vixus: why don't you change your graphics card drive to vesa
[07:28] <fyrestrtr> BenFairlesss: first step is to install the drivers for your video card.
[07:28] <dfwlinuxguy> omegaman03...so you got it working again?
[07:28] <OmegaMan03> yep
[07:28] <nuki> download the official iso?
[07:28] <dfwlinuxguy> good
[07:28] <nuki> i ordered the damn cd
[07:28] <fyrestrtr> nuki: from where?
[07:28] <Drogin> Anyone know how to prevent the SMC7004VBR router to fuck up at ubuntu-boot?
[07:28] <nuki> from the sites
[07:28] <Vixus> OmegaMan03: It's  a laptop
[07:28] <OmegaMan03> file searched for changed files last day with x-destop in the text
[07:28] <fyrestrtr> nuki: you didn't order it from the right place, because what you got is not a ubuntu cd.
[07:28] <DShepherd> can anyone install gnomesword on ubuntu edgy?  I get some dependeny error
[07:28] <nuki> well i've got the iso too
[07:28] <BenFairlesss> fyrestrtr: Will it just use the same drivers as for Windoze?
[07:28] <OmegaMan03> Vixes: vesa should work for every graphics card
[07:29] <fyrestrtr> BenFairlesss: no, what video card do you have? Check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Video
[07:29] <\pub\bash0r> Vixus: you just have to specify the amount of video memory
[07:29] <nuki> ok i'll go try. sorry and thanks
[07:29] <Vixus> OmegaMan03: I can't *access* the system!!!
[07:29] <Vixus> \pub\bash0r: Ditto
[07:29] <blackflare> whats the terminal command to open/edit a list file?
[07:29] <LjL> blackflare: what's a list file?
[07:29] <\pub\bash0r> Vixus: not even the console?
[07:30] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: list file? There are plenty of editors -- like vi and pico
[07:30] <blackflare> sources.list
[07:30] <BenFairlesss> fyrestrtr: Well it's a laptop actually. I'm guessing it's just the built in graphics thingy (I'm a n00b)
[07:30] <Vixus> \pub\bash0r: No, because I can't even get into textmode
[07:30] <OmegaMan03> Vixus: There should be a recovery text mode option, ctrl-alt-f1 or something after you get to login window
[07:30] <blackflare> I want to be able to save it so I have to use sudo to open it
[07:30] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:30] <Vixus> BenFairlesss: No! LOOKOUT!
[07:30] <blackflare> thanks
[07:30] <Vixus> :D
[07:30] <LjL> !username
[07:30] <ubotu> Please prefix what you're saying with a name to avoid confusion. See !tab
[07:30] <\pub\bash0r> Vixus: did you try to add the runlevel 3 to the boot line?
[07:30] <fyrestrtr> BenFairlesss: the first thing you should do is check the supported laptop guide :) maybe someone has already tested it?
[07:30] <Vixus> OmegaMan03: When I try that, there's  bright flash of light

[07:31] <M0E^lnx> how do I specify which OS should boot by default in grub?
[07:31] <Vixus> \pub\bash0r: Ah... runlevel
[07:31] <\pub\bash0r> Vixus: then boot without usplash
[07:31] <Vixus> \pub\bash0r: no one told me that...
[07:31] <\pub\bash0r> they told you ;)
[07:31] <BenFairlesss> Is that just on the Ubuntu support site?
[07:31] <\pub\bash0r> just add "3" to the kernel options
[07:31] <citriz> anyone know how to turn off an ipods auto launch of rhythmbox?
[07:31] <Vixus> no someone said 3.
[07:31] <\pub\bash0r> und remove "splash"
[07:31] <Vixus> thanks
[07:31] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: there is a 'default' line, the number after that is the default loaded os.
[07:31] <Vixus> brb
[07:31] <\pub\bash0r> then it should work
[07:31] <Vixus> ok
[07:31] <M0E^lnx> but my OS's are not numbered in menu.ls
[07:31] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: it starts with 0, not 1.
[07:32] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: the first entry is 0, the second entry is 1, etc.
[07:32] <OmegaMan03> Thanks for the help guys
[07:32] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: each 'title' line is considered an entry. The first title line is entry number 0 -- does that make sense?
[07:33] <T2T> Does some one no how to mount a ntfs or have a guide or something

[07:35] <viller> ls

[07:36] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: there is an entry at the official ubuntu wiki for it (although I have never had the need for it). Might be worth a look for reference.
[07:36] <viller> how can I start mysql?
[07:36] <Moosejaw> hey alll...any of you guys play online poker in ubuntu?
[07:36] <aeromix> Journeyman: ?
[07:36] <bitmvnch> howdy all, i've just done a dist-upgrade from dapper to edgy on a server, and an associate says that a machine he did that on failed to boot.  i wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar, or had success recently.
[07:36] <baastrup> is the any easy way to try a newer kernel?
[07:36] <citriz> is anyone willing to help me with an ipod problem under linux?
[07:36] <pike_> M0E^lnx: btw to autoboot just once to a different os just sudo grub-set-default 1  or whatever
[07:36] <fyrestrtr> baastrup: you could compile it manually.
[07:37] <M0E^lnx> well, I want to have a defined default OS to boot after 10 seconds every time
[07:37] <atlef> Moosejaw : yes, expekt in vmware
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: you'd need to change /boot/grub/menu.lst and the default line for that.
[07:38] <flossgeek> hi the page at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/AIGLXOnDapper for installing aiglx on dapper has a url which is dead being http://ubuntu.compiz.net/. Is there any other way i can do this?
[07:39] <rajiv_nair> wat xactly is the difference between AIGLX and XGL??
[07:39] <flossgeek> rajiv_nair different techs that do similiar jobs
[07:40] <fyrestrtr> rajiv_nair: one is build in, the other is another X server on top of xorg. Xorg 7.1 comes with AIGLX. XGL has better support for ATI.
[07:40] <id10t> anyone able to help with sed?  i need to replace ..'s in a file name with .0 ...

[07:44] <_pwf_> everytime that i try to add my mp3 collection to amarok or rythmbox the whole xorg crashes and hangs, i have to get to a manual console and kill the process, sometimes even those consoles hang, the mp3 collection is mounted via smb and is big, around 300gb, any reason for that?
[07:44] <viller> fyrestrtr: I don't have a script in init.d anymore. I removed it because I didn't want mysql starting every time I start my computer
[07:44] <fyrestrtr> viller: oh geez :|
[07:44] <viller> ?
[07:44] <viller> what geez
[07:44] <fyrestrtr> viller: that's not how you do that. Next time, read the man for update-rc.d or use bum
[07:44] <blackflare> hey is there a simple way to setup some programs to run every time? Like getting it to do synergyc 192.168.0.105    on startup?
[07:45] <fyrestrtr> viller: for now, the easiest way would be to re-install it.

[07:45] <fyrestrtr> blackflare: depends on when you want it to start. If when you login to gnome, then just add it to the startup program list for the session.
[07:45] <blackflare> ah ok
[07:45] <Trixsey> why does it take so much time packing programs for ubuntu? like.. repositories
[07:45] <viller> fyrestrtr: I didn't remove the file directly. I used that update-rc.d. Now the cli says /etc/init.d/mysqld doesn't exist

[07:45] <Stormx2> Hey all
[07:45] <Trixsey> are weeks after real releases
[07:45] <Trixsey> even big releases

[07:46] <atlef> M0E^lnx : have you looked here http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/
[07:46] <fyrestrtr> viller: its probably /etc/init.d/mysql
[07:46] <Trixsey> GAIM for isntance
[07:46] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Programs don't get released for ubuntu after releases. Not official ones.
[07:46] <Trixsey> I got 2.0.0b3.1
[07:46] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Its called feature freeze.
=== SurfnKid_ is now known as SurfnKid
[07:46] <Trixsey> there is 2.0.0b5
[07:46] <Trixsey> ok?

[07:47] <blackflare> aw :/ easycam didnt work
[07:47] <M0E^lnx> fyrestrtr: the automated setup in the wiki didn't
[07:47] <Trixsey> what is a feature freeze? :/

[07:48] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Ubuntu has a strict set of rules for what packages get though. Packaging GAIM in a reliable and bugfree state is tricky, they can't just scrap that process the moment a new version comes out a day before an ubuntu release.
[07:48] <Trixsey> GAIM is buggy for me
[07:48] <emilia> does anyone know if i can go full screen in vmware in just one desktop? so it doesnt take precedence over my other 4 desktops?
[07:48] <Trixsey> so is Azureus
[07:48] <EBAR> Does anyone know if Broadcom chips will be supported by Fiesty Fawn?
[07:48] <Ash-Fox> Is there some sort of command I can use to tell X to listen on a ethernet card -- without having to restart X?
[07:48] <Trixsey> even installed through synaptic
[07:48] <Stormx2> Trixsey: So get a new version?
[07:48] <viller> furestrtr: yes it is
[07:48] <fyrestrtr> Ash-Fox: you'll have to restart X either way.
[07:49] <fyrestrtr> Ash-Fox: unless you start a new instance of X on another console :)
[07:49] <Trixsey> so I didn't see why they have rules that strict applying to software that obviously needs more development :P
[07:49] <Ash-Fox> fyrestrtr, blah :/
[07:49] <Trixsey> heck those are barely stable releases :p
[07:49] <fyrestrtr> viller: sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart should start it up for you.
[07:49] <Stormx2> Trixsey: GAIM was stable & very bug free in dapper. If you wanted complete bug-free hand holding stay with dapper.
[07:50] <eternal_p> good afternoon all...can anyone help me....my PCMCIA BT adaptor is only being detected as a serial device....so I cannot scan with it @ all

[07:50] <M0E^lnx> anyone please!
[07:50] <M0E^lnx> help!
[07:50] <indianajones> ok thx
[07:50] <Stormx2> EBAR: Yeah I did too
[07:50] <Stormx2> eternal_p: POV, but I prefer GAIM
[07:51] <Stormx2> M0E^lnx: Whats the issue?
[07:51] <M0E^lnx> ndiswrapper
[07:51] <eternal_p> what about webcam support, etc. which I remember gaim 1.x was lacking
[07:51] <fyrestrtr> eternal_p: still is lacking, afaik
[07:51] <Stormx2> VV (video & voice) is still not merged into gaim
[07:51] <Stormx2> amsn can do it.
[07:51] <M0E^lnx> Stormx2 I'm following this howto http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102&highlight=install+ndiswrapper but it's not working for me...
[07:51] <Stormx2> so can gaim-vv, which I understand to be a fork of GAIM

[07:52] <fyrestrtr> I heard that they were merging it sometime.....
[07:52] <Journeyman> what would be the best way to reinstall gnome?

[07:53] <eternal_p> it is the only thing that doesn't work with Ubuntu for me....(other than fighting with WPA :) )
[07:53] <shwag> Journeyman: thanks
[07:53] <Journeyman> Stormx2, the progress bar doesn't work in certain themes
[07:53] <Stormx2> Journeyman: I think gnome is probably a transitional package.....
[07:53] <M0E^lnx> is there any way to browse the repos with a browser, grab a few packages and install them manually?
[07:53] <loka> k os den
[07:53] <Stormx2> Journeyman: Do the themes require a specific GTK2 engine?
[07:53] <Stormx2> Journeyman: That may be the issue
[07:53] <LjL> Stormx2: yeah, it depends on KDE, it's being phased out
[07:53] <LjL> (sorry)
[07:54] <Journeyman> Stormx2, the default theme is one with the problem
[07:54] <LjL> !es | loka
[07:54] <ubotu> loka: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[07:54] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: manually how?
[07:54] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: the only manually way I know is to compile from source.
[07:54] <Journeyman> I downloaded a couple others to test it
[07:54] <Journeyman> some work, but most don't
[07:54] <M0E^lnx> you can't install .debs manually?
[07:54] <Stormx2> Journeyman: Eek. Well maybe remove x? I'm not sure...
[07:54] <Stormx2> M0E^lnx: You can.
[07:54] <shwag> Journeyman: isnt there more since it uses apt-key ?
[07:54] <LjL> M0E^lnx: yup
[07:54] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: sure, with dpkg
[07:54] <Journeyman> storm well I think the problem is just with gnome not X
[07:54] <LjL> !deb | M0E^lnx
[07:54] <ubotu> M0E^lnx: deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[07:54] <M0E^lnx> can someone just get me an address for an edgy repo?
[07:54] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: but that's not manually for me :)
[07:54] <Journeyman> this is why I was looking at reinstalling it
[07:55] <Stormx2> M0E^lnx: Theres a graphic app for it in edgy, and also sudo dpkg -i blaa.deb
[07:55] <Journeyman> shouldn't be a problem
[07:55] <Stormx2> Be back in 20 minutes
[07:55] <fyrestrtr> are you running dapper or edgy?
[07:55] <M0E^lnx> edgy
[07:55] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: what's the problem with your sources list?
[07:56] <fyrestrtr> !easysource | M0E^lnx
[07:56] <ubotu> M0E^lnx: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[07:56] <M0E^lnx> nothing... but I have no internet access
[07:56] <fyrestrtr> oh whoops.
[07:56] <M0E^lnx> I'm trying to set it up
[07:56] <blackflare> alsa keeps making me hungry
[07:56] <M0E^lnx> so I'm gonna try grabbing the packages, put them into a pendrive, and install from there
[07:56] <blackflare> it looks like salsa
[07:57] <citriz> could someone help me with frostwire?
[07:57] <eternal_p> does anyone know of a scrolling RSS news ticker for the gnome desktop?
[07:57] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: deb http://[country-code] .archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse
[07:58] <fyrestrtr> citriz: try asking your real question ;)
[07:58] <tonyyarusso> eternal_p: I don't know if it's a ticker or what, but an apt search suggested straw might?
[07:58] <tonyyarusso> eternal_p: also, gnome-fifth-toe
[07:59] <L0cKd0wN> When I run an instance of vncserver from the command line, I can login from my Windows machine (using VNC Viewer), but all I get is a blank screen with an 'X' mouse cursor (I'm presuming this is a blank X Windows screen).
[07:59] <L0cKd0wN> how do i login to gnome?
[07:59] <eternal_p> thank you, i'll take a look
[07:59] <M0E^lnx> but that only has packages.gz
[07:59] <M0E^lnx> no individual packages
[07:59] <fyrestrtr> L0cKd0wN: have you started a session?
[08:00] <L0cKd0wN> don't think so, how might i go about doing that
[08:00] <fyrestrtr> M0E^lnx: just browse it online?
[08:00] <M0E^lnx> yes
[08:00] <L0cKd0wN> the computer has no monitor
[08:00] <L0cKd0wN> so i have to do everything, via terminal
[08:00] <M0E^lnx> fyrestrtr yes... I need to just browse it online
[08:01] <eternal_p> tonyyarusso  : any idea where I can download fifth-toe?
[08:01] <BjoeHrn> does anyone can help me with my audigy 2zs? I made a dist-upgrade and my sound don't work anymore
[08:01] <eternal_p> forget it, I found it :)
[08:01] <fyrestrtr> L0cKd0wN: have a read through https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC ?
[08:01] <tonyyarusso> eternal_p: It's in the repos
[08:03] <citriz> fyrestrtr, i've tried. noone will help.
[08:03] <eternal_p> thats odd...it is telling me tht I need the gnome-desktop-enviroment and gnome-core...but I am running gnome, am I missing something?
[08:03] <citriz> i cannot get the GUI to show up on frostwire. i have java installed, the latest even. and when i start up frostwire, it doesnt show anything. just an empty box.
[08:04] <eternal_p> its ok..damm typos... :)
[08:05] <fyrestrtr> citriz: did you make sure you have sun java installed and that its the default jre?
[08:05] <citriz> fyrestrtr, no i havent
[08:05] <citriz> do i go to the java website? or how should i go about this?
[08:05] <fyrestrtr> citriz: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[08:05] <fyrestrtr> !java | citriz
[08:05] <ubotu> citriz: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:06] <citriz> There is only 1 program which provides java
[08:06] <citriz> (/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/bin/java). Nothing to configure.
[08:06] <M0E^lnx> dang this sux
[08:06] <james__> Hi guys, there are about 10 computers on my network, i can access and ping all of them except for 1 stubborn desktop... when i ping it it says destination host unreachable. How can I troubleshoot this? Between my laptop and this desktop they cant communicate with each other.. it has me puzzled
[08:06] <citriz> sun-java5-jre is already the newest version.
[08:07] <fyrestrtr> citriz: post a screenshot of what you see when you start frostwire
[08:07] <citriz> ok hold on
[08:08] <fyrestrtr> james__: perhaps there is a firewall running on that box that is blocking ICMP?
[08:09] <eternal_p> where in fifth-toe is an RSS news ticker?
[08:09] <tonyyarusso> eternal_p: I'm not sure - it was just in the apt-cache show info
[08:09] <shwag> do i need to have an gpg keys to access the main ubuntu repositories ?
[08:09] <eternal_p> ah,
[08:09] <citriz> where's a good place to host a screenshot?
[08:09] <m6s> In #mono noone answers or seems to be alive
[08:09] <tonyyarusso> shwag: No.  The ones the repos are signed with are installed by default, and you do not need your own
[08:09] <m6s> where can I ask something about Mono???
[08:10] <shwag> tonyyarusso: but i was playing with apt-key and decided to delete all the keys I had.
[08:10] <citriz> nevermind
[08:10] <james__> the desktop hasnt been touched and worked fine a week or so ago, it mainly sits in the corner as a file server and pvr. Im thinking it has to do with my new router/wireless setup at the laptop end but im not sure of ways to test if this is true.
[08:10] <tonyyarusso> shwag: Ah, eww.  Well, check !repos and see if it has them listed on it's link
[08:10] <shwag> !repos
[08:10] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource

[08:11] <Skaag> printing question - my printer prints the pages but they collect in reverse order, anyway to work around this? :-)
[08:12] <shwag> tonyyarusso: well, i guess this machine wont be receiving any more updates.
[08:12] <tonyyarusso> shwag: I know the keys are available - I'm just not sure where offhand unfortunately
[08:12] <shwag> tonyyarusso: yah, i cant find em
[08:12] <tonyyarusso> :(
[08:13] <\pub\bash0r> since I switched to Edgy, "dpkg-reconfigure locales" does no longer show a menu to select charsets ... how can I achieve this now?
[08:13] <tonyyarusso> shwag: Maybe you could search a keyserver for them.
[08:13] <fyrestrtr> citriz: suggest you try it with metacity (ie, beryl disabled)
[08:13] <alex-weej> \pub\bash0r: System -> Administration -> Language Support
[08:13] <shwag> tonyyarusso: is it sitting in the repository itself?  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/Release.gpg
[08:13] <tonyyarusso> shwag: Quite possible.  Looks promising.
[08:14] <M0E^ln1> hey guys... Now i'm getting this error from apt-get "Timestamp too far in the future"
[08:14] <escargot> Hello! Could someone help me with a problem I'm having creating plots in R under Edgy?
[08:14] <\pub\bash0r> alex-weej: doesn't that only affect gnome? (and does that also build missing charsets? because I thought they need to be generated first)
[08:14] <b03nto> !gcc
[08:14] <M0E^ln1> someone please help me
[08:14] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[08:14] <matthew_w> Is there a way to use nohup so that it does not make a log file?
[08:14] <fyrestrtr> M0E^ln1: clock skew? Check your timezone.
[08:15] <M0E^ln1> the clock is right
[08:15] <fyrestrtr> b03nto: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[08:15] <alex-weej> \pub\bash0r: no. and it builds your locales. it installs the i18n packages for you.
[08:15] <LeavingWindows> Hey! Anyone here who could help me with my non booting Ubuntu install-CD?
[08:15] <cyris|> hey, im trying to install build-essential, but im getting these errors.  build-essential: Depends: libc6-dev but it is not going to be installed or
[08:15] <cyris|>                             libc-dev
[08:15] <cyris|>                    Depends: g++ (>= 4:4.0) but it is not going to be installed
[08:15] <cyris|> anyone with ideas?
[08:15] <shwag> LeavingWindows: sounds like you burned it wrong
[08:15] <\pub\bash0r> alex-weej: ah ok, I just thought I've never seen ISO8859-1 there ... but I will take another look, thanks :)
[08:15] <bjorne> is there going to be a 64 plugins for firefox
[08:15] <b03nto> fyrestrtr, i know, what gcc version edgy use ? currently im still with dapper..
[08:15] <fyrestrtr> cyris|: edgy or dapper?
[08:16] <shwag> cyris|: yah yah,..i was thinking, a map...wher you...get this...JUMP...to conclusions.
[08:16] <LeavingWindows> shwag: it boots on another PC, but it wont boot on mine... Hirens boot CD boots just fine... :P
[08:16] <fyrestrtr> b03nto: 4.1.2
[08:16] <alex-weej> \pub\bash0r: i don't even know if that locale variant is bundled with anything anymore. everything seems to be UTF-8 now.
[08:16] <shwag> LeavingWindows: bios turn on boot order CD
[08:16] <b03nto> thanks.. i think im on my way to edgy now :)
[08:16] <\pub\bash0r> alex-weej: that would be problematic, as latex doesn't handle utf8 correctly in my case
[08:16] <\pub\bash0r> at least it kills portability to windows
[08:17] <LeavingWindows> shwag: CD is in first boot priority... it boots on another PC but not on mine!
[08:17] <flitzekacke> moin
[08:17] <\pub\bash0r> oh and I can't access my samba shares then -.-
[08:17] <sheriff> which UML modelling tool would you recommend?
[08:17] <shwag> LeavingWindows: maybe you burner cant read that media.  Burn the cd from a different computer.
[08:17] <LeavingWindows> shwag: other CDs boot but not the Ubuntu installer! (But the ubuntu installer works on other PCs...)
[08:17] <shwag> LeavingWindows: yup..burn it from a different computer.
[08:18] <shwag> LeavingWindows: or try burning it at a slower rate
[08:18] <shwag> LeavingWindows: but probably from a different computer will work.
[08:18] <LeavingWindows> shwag: I can read the CD fine from windows... it seems like it wont read the boot sector or something...
[08:18] <shwag> LeavingWindows: ive had burners that start going out and they still work but...no longer make bootable cds.
[08:18] <gustavsson> hi, can anyone tell me why my /dev/sda* has dissapeared?
[08:18] <gustavsson> I cant connect my mp3players or any usbdevices anymore :/
[08:19] <mc__> gustavsson: reboot
[08:19] <shwag> gustavsson: lsmod | grep hci
[08:19] <LeavingWindows> shwag: OK, but can I make a small partition on the HD, copy  the installer CD contents to it and boot from there?
[08:19] <pike_> gustavsson: "ls -t /dev | grep head" maybe its sdb or c

[08:19] <pike_> gustavsson: ach i mean | head
[08:20] <shwag> LeavingWindows: how about...boot off a knoppix cd....and then launch the ubuntu installer from inside of knoppix maybe.
[08:20] <Afflictin> hello all
[08:20] <tonyyarusso> Hi Afflictin
[08:20] <gustavsson> pike_: why should it hve changed? it have worked for months.
[08:20] <LeavingWindows> shwag: knoopix CD?
[08:20] <gustavsson> /dev/sda has it been for ages
[08:20] <Afflictin> hi tony
[08:20] <LeavingWindows> shwag: knoppix
[08:20] <pike_> gustavsson: do not question the ubuntu!
[08:20] <gustavsson> ?

[08:20] <Afflictin> I am enjoying using ubuntu, however, I am a lost
[08:21] <Afflictin> what should I do with it?
[08:21] <tonyyarusso> Afflictin: Can you be more specific?
[08:21] <Tyfius> anyone knows how I can install chkconfig on ubuntu ?
[08:21] <\lart> Afflictin: Um, use it?  You'll have to narrow that down, like a lot.
[08:21] <Tyfius> or at least emulate it, so I can install maya
[08:21] <shwag> tonyyarusso: i know...i will copy the keys off another ubuntu machine.
[08:21] <tonyyarusso> shwag: Good idea
[08:21] <Afflictin> are there any specific tasks that I can give it to do, should I make it a server, what should I do with it
[08:22] <tonyyarusso> Afflictin: Whatever you want.  I have a laptop with a general workstation setup as well as a small server.  It's flexible to whatever you need.
[08:22] <\lart> Afflictin: what do you want it to do?

[08:27] <aeromix> what's the best way to download kernel sources?????
[08:27] <wy> I wonder how can the window manager remember the windows sizes for me. I don't want to resize the windows everytime they start
[08:27] <\lart> iverianu: nope.  nobody can help you, at least not until you say what you need help with.
[08:27] <aeromix> !kernel
[08:27] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[08:27] <iverianu> I can't change the defolt language... can u tell me why :(
[08:28] <Chaosphilipp> another question: is there a partition manager available for ubuntu?

[08:28] <\pub\bash0r> Chaosphilipp: gparted for example
[08:29] <psusi> Chaosphilipp: there are many... try gparted

[08:32] <Journeyman> I am trying to use vnc, but anytime I try to run any X programs it locks up
[08:33] <Journeyman> gnome wouldn't start, nor would fluxbox, so I removed all window managers and just have it start up xterm
[08:33] <Journeyman> I try to run anything and it locks up
[08:33] <Journeyman> any idea/
[08:33] <MasterLexx> why is there different software for xubuntu than for kubuntu? why is there no amule for download in kubuntu?
[08:33] <pike_> rm -fr ~/.vnc then retry maybe
[08:34] <Journeyman> pike_, why would I want to do that, all my .vnc options are things I set up, it is worse off without that
[08:34] <Journeyman> all I get with default is the gnome startup screen locked up
[08:35] <pike_> and exec fluxbox freezes as well?
[08:35] <Journeyman> yeah
[08:35] <Journeyman> let me give you a screenshot
[08:35] <genesis> thx for the skype tipp, it worked ^^
[08:37] <M0E^lnx> Alright!... I got wireless
[08:37] <Journeyman> pike_, http://digitalparanoid.com/~matt/vnc.jpg
[08:37] <Journeyman> that is what happens when I type startfluxbox in the xterm
[08:38] <jshadias> journeyman, that link doesn't work
[08:38] <pike_> Journeyman: could you veryify url i cant access "/~matt/vnc.jpg was not found on this server"
[08:38] <Journeyman> hold on

[08:40] <chuchiperriman> someone are working on anjuta project??
[08:40] <nalioth> dunno what's up with your client, but our procedure is to do what we do gdb
[08:40] <hkais> hello
[08:40] <gdb> I understand that, I just figured by now there'd be some note that says, 'whatever happens, he's fine, leave him alone." or whatever.  I idle here 24/7.  I'm sure my connection drops from time to time as my cable modem is't 100 5reliable.
[08:41] <gdb> isn't*
[08:41] <hkais> how can i set /sys/bus/scsi/drivers/sd/0:0:0:0/block/queue/read_ahead_kb=16384 via sysctl?
[08:41] <gdb> er 100% reliable
[08:41] <Journeyman> how do you pipe all the output errors to a file

[08:42] <njero> Hi all, I am trying to install edgy eft and am letting it repartition the drive... it is a 75G partition and it has been working for a half hour.. how scared should I ne?
[08:42] <corecode> hey
[08:42] <njero> s/ne/be/
[08:42] <corecode> how would i change the default for rtsp:// urls in firefox?
[08:43] <corecode> it tries to launch totem, but that doesn't work somehow
[08:43] <Chaosphilipp> @njero: depends on what was on the partition before...
[08:43] <njero> lots of really good stuff.. like pictures and stuff...
[08:44] <njero> Chaosphilipp: can I stop the process... or will I completely hose it then
[08:44] <Chaosphilipp> hmmmm....do you see WHAT it does?
[08:45] <Chaosphilipp> i'm not a pro, so i would unlikely be the one who killed all your good stuff
=== flaco is now known as latuss

[08:59] <Chaosphilipp> @njero: do you use icq or aim?
[08:59] <jshadias> i know 32-bit WinXP needs different drivers
[08:59] <njero> I use gtalk and skype

[09:26] <dfwlinuxguy> there is a script that installs the broadcom drivers after you install fwcutter
[09:26] <dpro> anyone has a hint why ifconfig tun0 up constantly states "NO SUCH DVICE"
[09:26] <dfwlinuxguy> you have to run it by hand
[09:26] <dfwlinuxguy> I was using those for my laptop
[09:26] <dpro> and yes the module is loaded ....
[09:26] <aeromix> dfwlinuxguy: what's the package fot fwcutter?
[09:26] <dbernar1> d1gital: http://www.gnewsense.org/Builder/HowToCreateYourOwnGNULinuxDistribution
[09:26] <dfwlinuxguy> you have to either use that or the ndiswrapper
[09:26] <dfwlinuxguy> one second
[09:27] <d1gital> dbernar:  thx
[09:27] <dfwlinuxguy> bcm43xx-fwcutter
=== dbernar1 is now known as dabaR
[09:27] <Tobyman> Hi alL
[09:27] <aeromix> dfwlinuxguy: I have to use ndiswrapper, cuz the drivers are from windows
[09:27] <blackflare> I dont suppose anyone here has had experience getting ventrilo to work under wine?
[09:27] <soon> I have added the following to my fstab: UUID=c0c89034-92e2-4579-bb37-b14b6b09c346       /home/soon/CORSAIR      ext3    defaults,auto,user      0       0
[09:28] <dfwlinuxguy> ok..then don't install the fwcutter one
[09:28] <aeromix> dpro: what does iwconfig say?
[09:28] <dfwlinuxguy> mine had windows drivers as well, but I got it working with the fwcutter package
[09:28] <nofeardjb> A music messaging session has been requested. Please click the MM icon to accept.
[09:28] <soon> I was expeting the USB drive (from Corsair) to automount at /home/soon/CORSAIR ... it doesnt. When I right click to mount, it mounts at /media/usbdisk
[09:28] <aeromix> dpro: or ifconfig?
[09:28] <dpro> aeromix: iwconfig ? ifconfig says no such device ...
[09:28] <RoUx> ciao a tutti
[09:28] <nofeardjb> soon: that's how ubuntu automounts things for me...
[09:28] <RoUx> hi boys
[09:28] <soon> ciao
[09:29] <dabaR> soon: show the whole of fstab on pastebin
[09:29] <RoUx> can you help me?
[09:29] <soon> which pastebin ?
[09:29] <dabaR> paste.ubuntu-nl.org, give me the URL you get too.
[09:29] <dfwlinuxguy> are you using wpa_supplicant?
[09:29] <soon> okay then
[09:29] <dpro> aeromix: exactly: tun0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
[09:30] <constrictor> anyone use perl?
[09:30] <dfwlinuxguy> dpro..that means the driver for your card is not loaded
[09:30] <soon> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36692/
[09:30] <nofeardjb> soon: if you want it mounted else where you need to change your fstab to make it permanent otherwise use umount and mount to change it temporarily
[09:30] <dpro> aeromix: aftera "ifconfig tun0 up"
[09:30] <dabaR> constrictor: no, noone does.
[09:30] <aeromix> dfwlinuxguy, no..
[09:30] <aeromix> dpro: whats the device like?
[09:30] <javaJake> My battery indicator is saying 0%, but my battery is really fine!
[09:30] <dabaR> soon: no idea.
[09:31] <soon> fair enough :-)
[09:31] <javaJake> I can even "cat /proc/acpi/battery/CMB0/state" and see the remaining mWh in the battery.
[09:31] <javaJake> What's up?
[09:31] <soon> nofeardjb check my fstab at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36692/
[09:31] <javaJake> And guys, PLEASE don't ignore me if you know!!!
[09:31] <Antissn> somerville32		Antissn, http://linux.cergynux.net/canon/ broked link
[09:31] <Antissn> when will you start support big games such as ghost recon AW, Quake 4, sniper elite, half life
[09:32] <soon> javajake ... you got all the ACPI stuff enable in kernel and BIOS ?
[09:32] <enyc> has anybody seen this invelted-shift-state problem in edgy-kernel whatnot -- I now have a  tty3  that has inverted shift-state -- infact I have to use alt+SHIFT+f[12456]  to escape from tty3 now!
[09:32] <Journeyman> Antissn, what do you mean "you guys"
[09:32] <javaJake> soon: don't know, how to do I tell?
[09:32] <edd_> any1 know how to get sound working in flash???
[09:32] <sysrage> anybody know a fix for flash videos (youtube, collegehumor, etc) only play about 2 seconds of video at a time?
[09:32] <nofeardjb> soon: it looks fine to me.. what happens when you restart?
[09:32] <enyc> [even if i go to tty3 and press/release the shift buttons and press capslock in attempt to reset the shift-state] 
[09:32] <soon> Your BIOS you check during boot up ... try taht for starters
[09:32] <javaJake> soon: my bios is super super simple. Like, say, only time set and password. :(
[09:33] <Tobyman> I need your help... My Ubunutu doesn't start anymore... it stucks when trying to load "Confoguring Netowrk Interface..."... and this from the moment I tried to remove NdisWrapper and install it again... I get the instructions from here (http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Uninstall) Any idea how can I fix this... Thank you in advance for your help
[09:33] <soon> nofeardjb ... I havent rebooted ... its a USB memeory stickm, so I pull it in and out all the time ... not only for booting
[09:33] <javaJake> soon: so is there a different way to tell? I can pull up all sorts of info under /proc/acpi.
[09:33] <dfwlinuxguy> tobyman..you can hit ctl-c when it gets to that point and it should continue booting
[09:33] <dabaR> Tobyman: try booting a live CD, or rescue mode, and remove the ndiswrapper module. This is only a guess, though.
[09:33] <Antissn> if you have the linux patch to play those huge games
[09:34] <javaJake> soon: like my laptop temperature, battery information, cpu stuff, tc.
[09:34] <nofeardjb> hmmm
[09:34] <towel> anyone ever heard of a problem with 'network manager' where it is able to connect to unsecured wifi's but not secured?
[09:34] <nofeardjb> brb
[09:34] <javaJake> soon: my power manager says I'm at 0%, but also shows how much power I'm pulling from my battery....
[09:34] <Antissn> Soon AMD will come with the real Quad core
[09:34] <dfwlinuxguy> towel..depends on how it is secured
[09:34] <soon> javajake .. Im not sure, I think most kernels come with the ACPI on as default ... you may need to enable it in Gnome settings
[09:34] <javaJake> soon: and how do I do that?
[09:34] <mcgrof_> Anyone have an edgy sshd server with LDAP working? I'd like to see your /etc/pam.d/sshd
[09:35] <dfwlinuxguy> WEP is easy and insecure...WPA is more difficult but more secure
[09:35] <mcgrof_> ssh rather
[09:35] <soon> I use xubuntu .. dont know Gnome ...
[09:35] <javaJake> soon: oh, rats
[09:35] <soon> WHERE WHERE ?!?!
[09:35] <somerville32> Woot Xubuntu! :)
[09:35] <javaJake> soon: well, terminal ways will do it. I'm not really a n00b.
[09:35] <javaJake> somerville32: works really well on a 64 MB laptop. :D
[09:35] <nofeardjb> soon: have you done a "sudo mount -a" ?
[09:35] <somerville32> soon: You should join #xubuntu :)
[09:35] <soon> nope
[09:36] <ramon1> movistar
[09:36] <javaJake> soon: how do I make sure acpi is enabled through the terminal?
[09:36] <soon> now I have :-)
[09:36] <ramon1> movistaar
[09:36] <n2diy> I couldn't get Dapper to install on my test box, so I installed Breezy. Can I upgrade to Dapper now, with the CD?
[09:36] <somerville32> Yup
[09:36] <nofeardjb> soon: how's it working?
[09:36] <soon> fine :-)
[09:36] <dfwlinuxguy> lsmod | grep acpi
[09:37] <ramon1> movistar
[09:37] <nofeardjb> soon: excellent
[09:37] <Uboon2> I started xpenguins, they walk all over my desktop. How can I stop them?  HELP!
[09:37] <dfwlinuxguy> javaJake lsmod | grep acpi
[09:37] <soon> Hmm Javajake ... ACPI can be enabled / disabled in BIOS, in GRUB/LILO, in Kernel and through the desktion environment configs
[09:37] <pike_> Uboon2: you cant theyve taken over by now
[09:37] <Uboon2> pike loll
[09:37] <soon> you must feed them herrings
[09:37] <psusi> Uboon2: kill xpenguinds... ctrl-c if you are still in the terminal window
[09:37] <MarcN> Uboon2: open a console and type    killall xpengins
[09:37] <javaJake> soon: well, would gnome be getting information about my battery  in the first place if acpi wasn't working? :P
[09:38] <Uboon2> tnx MarcN !!
[09:38] <ramon1> motorola c650 movistar
[09:38] <soon> Dont kill the penguins !
[09:38] <javaJake> soon: like say how much battery is going
[09:38] <soon> love the penguins
[09:38] <soon> nope .. I dont think so
[09:38] <javaJake> soon: thought so
[09:38] <soon> what is you laptop?
[09:38] <javaJake> soon: yea
[09:38] <javaJake> soon: oh, Compaq Presario 1720US.
[09:39] <javaJake> It's on the older end (1.2 GHz)
[09:39] <Tobyman> dfwlinuxguy -> Ctrl + C doesn't help
[09:39] <soon> http://zenux.net/linux/1720.html
[09:39] <javaJake> Seveas: wasn;t that a little... extreme?
[09:39] <soon> might help you  ...
[09:40] <Tobyman> dabaR -=> I will try the Live CD...
[09:40] <lifepositive> firefox is not open, but it says firerfox is running and that I cant open firefox until I close firefox!  Any solution?
[09:40] <dfwlinuxguy> then you should boot up in single usermode and remove ndiswrapper..apt-get remove ndiswrapper
[09:40] <psusi> lifepositive: reboot?
[09:40] <mobile> hello,
[09:41] <lifepositive> psusi: any soilution besides reboot?
[09:41] <Vixus> Argh
[09:41] <psusi> lifepositive: open task manager and kill the running firefox
[09:41] <javaJake> soon: wow, that guy has the same hardware config as mine... problem is, he's using a kernel patch. I don't want to compile my kernel. *Sigh*
[09:41] <Vixus> Now my laptop monitor doesn't work under ubuntu at all
[09:41] <dfwlinuxguy> killall firefox-bin
[09:41] <lifepositive> psusi: task manager?
[09:41] <lifepositive> psusi: how I load it?
[09:41] <Vixus>  even at runlevel 3
[09:41] <drach> lifepositive: remove file lock from /home/user/name/.mozilla/firefox/***.default/
[09:42] <drach> lifepositive: remove file lock from /home/user_name/.mozilla/firefox/***.default/
[09:42] <mobile> hello,

[09:42] <Vixus> anyone else have problems with the nvidia drivers?
[09:42] <EmxBA> seveaz: ?
[09:42] <lifepositive> dfwlinuxguy: thanks!  "killall firefox-bin" fixed it :)
[09:42] <dfwlinuxguy> no problem
[09:42] <lifepositive> dfwlinuxguy: I didnt need the 9
[09:42] <psusi> you should never do kill -9 without a regular kill first
[09:42] <lifepositive> drach: killall firefox-bin worked easier
[09:42] <javaJake> soon: yea, limited acpi support is the problem. Drat.
[09:43] <javaJake> soon: well, I'll just have a cat program running so I can watch how much my battery power's dropped. :)

[09:48] <dfwlinuxguy> maybe you need to uncomment multiverse in /etc/apt/sources.list?
[09:48] <FFForever> i really need printer support
[09:48] <nofeardjb> Tobyman: xnest is one possibility
[09:48] <SambaNEWBIE> Samba isn't working right. New install on Ubuntu 5.10. This is the error message can't open username map /etc/samba/smbusers. Error No such file or directory

[09:49] <Dybber> Hi I am trying to get grub to automatically boot up in Ubuntu if nothing other is selected in the boot-menu. timeout is set to 10 in /boot/grub/menu.lst but it doesn't work
[09:49] <Vixus> DarkQueen: Wasn't it detected by Ubuntu?
[09:49] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie have you run smbpasswd and created users?
[09:49] <pike_> Dybber: timeout doesnt work or it boots wrong os?
[09:49] <Tobyman> 10x guys I appreaciate your help
[09:49] <cypher1> is not opera available in edgy-commercial repository ?
[09:49] <SambaNEWBIE> dfwlinuxguy .. yes I did.
[09:50] <Dybber> pike_: timeout doesn't work its just waiting for user input
[09:50] <spx2> does someone here code in vim
[09:50] <psusi> Dybber: define 'doesn't work'
[09:50] <spx2> ?
[09:50] <DarkQueen> Not, says that he(she) needs instalr a controller
[09:50] <mobile> dfwlinuxguy no i install nothing because it works with edgy out of the box
[09:50] <nofeardjb> spx2: yup for C++ i do
[09:50] <lewyjh> cypher1, why do you need sufari? mozzila is very similar to it.
[09:50] <metatecque> !doesn
[09:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about doesn - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:50] <metatecque> !doesn't work
[09:50] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[09:50] <spx2> nofeardjb: i would like to ask you how did you configure it
[09:51] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie...sorry ls /etc/samba/smbusers returns what?
[09:51] <n2diy> Can I upgrade Breezy to Dapper with the CD? it is a test box, so data loss isn't an issue.
[09:51] <Vixus> To boot into text mode... is it runlevel=3 or runlevel 3 at the end of the kernel line in grub?????????
[09:51] <pike_> Dybber: syntax in menu.lst is "timeout     10" without the # ?
[09:51] <nofeardjb> spx2: this site helped me a ton http://www.vi-improved.org/tutorial.php
[09:51] <Dybber> pike_ yes
[09:51] <psusi> n2diy: you don't even need the cd to do it
[09:51] <SambaNEWBIE> dfwlinuxguy .. there is no file, I have checked that. I am not sure why not or how to fix.
[09:51] <spx2> nofeardjb: but i have to read allot
[09:51] <padavoine> n2diy: don't you wanna upgrade to edgy ?
[09:51] <dfwlinuxguy> mobile...apt-cache search wifi-radar returns the package for me
[09:51] <Dybber> psusi: the grub menu doesn't go in any OS by default - its just waiting for me selecting an OS
[09:51] <nofeardjb> spx2: lol what do you want specifically?
[09:52] <n2diy> Psusi, The test box is isolated from the internet.
[09:52] <DarkQueen> Vixus: Do you know where I can search?
[09:52] <padavoine> n2diy: oh yeah that makes a difference
[09:52] <psusi> Dybber: did you tell it which one should be the default?
[09:52] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie..you only need that file if you are going to map windows users to a different unix user
[09:52] <lewyjh> !kill
[09:52] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[09:52] <padavoine> n2diy: i guess you can... i dunno if you can "upgrade" or if you have to install dapper over breezy
[09:52] <lewyjh> !die ubotu
[09:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about die ubotu - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:53] <dfwlinuxguy> you can comment that out in smb.conf if you are not trying to do that
[09:53] <lewyjh> !fuck?
[09:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fuck? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:53] <Dybber> psusi: how do i do that? i got "default  0" in menu.lst
[09:53] <lewyjh> !how to fuck
[09:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about how to fuck - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:53] <padavoine> n2diy: if you have a separate /home partition it doesn't make any difference anyway...
[09:53] <lewyjh> HA
[09:53] <n2diy> padavoine, ok I'll try installing on top of Breezy.
[09:53] <aragorn_> hi all?
[09:53] <SambaNEWBIE> dwflinuxguy - Okay. Any idea why I can't authenticate? I assumed that was the problem as the error logged on the machine I am trying to log into.
[09:54] <bjv> !tor
[09:54] <ubotu> tor: anonymizing overlay network for TCP. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.1.1.23-1 (edgy), package size 763 kB, installed size 1556 kB
[09:54] <cyber_brain_mfkg> maybe offtopic--how to set up hosts on noip.com???
[09:54] <cyber_brain_mfkg> one friend told me that i will need that 2 use ssh
[09:54] <bjv> does this channel still ban tor?
[09:54] <cyber_brain_mfkg> ???
[09:54] <psusi> Dybber: yep... default 0 and timeout 10 should do it
[09:54] <psusi> Dybber: pastebin your menu.lst
[09:54] <nofeardjb> go to no-ip.com?
[09:54] <boink> or you could use www.dyndns.org
[09:54] <boink> that's a free ip-service too
[09:55] <SambaNEWBIE> cyber_brian_mfkg - I am using dyndns.org right now to ssh in with no problems.
[09:55] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie...you will need to fix that first and restart samba then tell me if you still can't log in
[09:55] <othy> dfwlinuxguy:  I don't have mutiverse, I have universe && backport
[09:55] <boink> dyndns.org works very well
[09:55] <cyber_brain_mfkg> ok i reg myself on noip.com
[09:55] <aragorn_> have anyone installed dmraid on edgy?
[09:55] <zukalk> i can't get sound to work on america's army. killall esd doesn't work anymore. any ideas?
[09:55] <cyber_brain_mfkg> but i don't know what type of server i need
[09:55] <dfwlinuxguy> othy...edgy or dapper?
[09:55] <n2diy> padavoine, it's my test box, no significant data is on it.
[09:55] <psusi> aragorn_: I have not installed it in edgy, but I wrote the FakeRaidHowto on the wiki
[09:55] <vixus> Ok, I finaly got into console, I'm using irssi
[09:55] <othy> dfwlinuxguy: dapper
[09:56] <vixus> How do I switch between bashes?
[09:56] <nofeardjb> cyber: you don't need a server?
[09:56] <psusi> vixus: huh?
[09:56] <SambaNEWBIE> dwflinuxguy - I'm sorry I think I missed something. Fix what first?

[09:57] <n2diy> vixus, if your running X, yes, just open multible terminals.
[09:57] <GuestD59339> I'm new in linux and I'll install ubuntu
[09:57] <cyber_brain_mfkg> nofeardjb: he told me i might need this because of my ISP
[09:57] <vixus> Not in X!
[09:57] <dfwlinuxguy> othy...in /etc/apt/sources.list..add multiverse after everywhere you see universe...then reload if you are using synaptic or apt-get update
[09:57] <vixus> In text mode... how do I switch between... inputs?
[09:57] <SambaNEWBIE> cyber - I suggest dyndns.org as it probably works with your router making it much easier to use.
[09:57] <vixus> Terminals.
[09:57] <psusi> vixus: yea... ctrl-alt-n will switch to the nth tty
[09:57] <vixus> thanks
[09:58] <Jary> I have a trouble installing ubuntu. When I try to install, it tries to load the kernel, then after it hits 100%; I have a black screen with 3 lines showing it couldn't load the kernel
[09:58] <aragorn_> psusi : Hi!!! I've read several times your wiki! It's wonderful!
[09:58] <psusi> Dybber: that looks like it should auto boot windows after 10 seconds
[09:58] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie...get it working?
[09:58] <padavoine> Guest --> what's the pc... you want desktop for sure, then it depends on what processor you have
[09:58] <n2diy> vixus, ok, can't help you there.
[09:58] <vixus> psusi: it's not working in irssi.
[09:58] <nofeardjb> cyber: ooooh
[09:58] <Dybber> psusi, yea but it doesn't auto-boot anything
[09:58] <psusi> aragorn_: thank you
[09:58] <vixus> psusi: As in, I'm trying it but nothing's happening.
[09:58] <SambaNEWBIE> dwflinuxguy -- I somehow missed your instruction. What was the last thing you wanted me to do?
[09:58] <nofeardjb> cyber: sent you IM
[09:58] <psusi> vixus: you have to use the left ctrl and alt keys for some ancient reason
[09:59] <psusi> Dybber: try changing the default to 1?
[09:59] <GuestD59339> amd64 3500+
[09:59] <aragorn_> psusi : I've a question for you ;) I followed all the edgy bug on launchpad
[09:59] <drach> Jary: what is chipset on motherboard? intel 965?
[09:59] <GuestD59339> 1gb ram
[09:59] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie...if you are not mapping windows users to a different linux user...comment out the smbusers line in your smb.conf...restart samba and try to log in again
[09:59] <nofeardjb> cyber: did you get my IM?
[09:59] <cyber_brain_mfkg> nofeardjb: yes
[09:59] <Jary> drach: I am using AMD athlon
[09:59] <nofeardjb> lol kk respond in there once you've complete that
[09:59] <Antissn> see ya , , AMD user best choice
[09:59] <Dybber> psusi, ok I will try that now *rebooting*
[09:59] <SambaNEWBIE> dwflinuxguy - thanks will try and get back to you soon.
[10:00] <aragorn_> psusi: and I installed the patched version of dmraid...now all works fine but there is still a problem
[10:00] <mobile> hello, pls help me. i compile a new kernel and my wlan card doesnt work. with the orig. kernel my atheros / madwifi cards works out of the box.
[10:00] <Jary> drach: AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual, to be precise
[10:01] <M0E^lnx> hey guys, I've created a script... of course it starts with #/bin/sh but when I try to execute it, it says /bin/sh bad interpreter
[10:01] <M0E^lnx> any ideas?
[10:01] <vixus> Ok, I checked my xorg.conf, the driver is definitely nvidia, but my monitor still won't turn on... X is running, sounds coming fine but somehow I can't see anything. I am on a laptop.
[10:01] <aragorn_> psusi: how can I lauch dmraid during the boot? I have to start it manually every time
[10:01] <ubun> how can i mount a .iso to see it's files virtually (so i dont have to burn it to CD to use it, like you can with 'daemon-tools' in windows)?
[10:01] <cyber_brain_mfkg> nofeardjb: IM???
[10:01] <GuestD59339> anyone can help me installing ubuntu?
[10:01] <vixus> This all happened after I followed the Ubuntu nvidia guide.
[10:01] <psusi> M0E^lnx: you mean it starts with #!/bin/sh right?
[10:01] <vixus> Anyone know how to solve this?
[10:01] <calm> i have a problem. my desktop is frozen. i can move the mouse, and my desktop icons will highlight on mouseover. clicking on icons does nothing, though. the panel does not respond to anything. Alt-F1 will highlight the "applications" menu, but it does not actually open the menu. (the arrow keys don't do anything from there)
[10:01] <dfwlinuxguy> it's #!/bin/sh
[10:01] <M0E^lnx> yes
[10:02] <dfwlinuxguy> you put #/bin/sh
[10:02] <psusi> aragorn_: once you install the package it sets itself to start during boot
[10:02] <cfd90> Help!  I updated to Edgy via the automatic updator, and now X is broken and I can't seem to fix it...
[10:02] <cfd90> Is this common?
[10:02] <ubun> calm restart X with ctrl+alt+backspace i guess
[10:02] <dfwlinuxguy> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:02] <cfd90> Eh, I guess I'll reconfigure it :|
[10:02] <vixus> Ho hum.
[10:03] <ikke81> hello everybody
[10:03] <cyber_brain_mfkg> nofeardjb: u send me something or not?
[10:03] <calm> i don't want to restart, because i'm ssh-ed into other computers and running compute-intensive jobs on them
[10:03] <aragorn_> psusi: that doesn't work , I have to start dmraid every time with the "dmraid -ay "
[10:03] <vixus> Is it something to do with my resolution or memory settings?
[10:03] <vixus> Can anyone... help me?
[10:03] <ikke81> the commando dpkg does'nt work any more
[10:03] <ikke81> i get the following error
[10:03] <psusi> aragorn_: you are running edgy right?  try reinstalling the package?
=== No_Beuno is now known as Beuno
[10:03] <vixus> Please? This is a really strange issue.
[10:04] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus..you have to ask a question before we can help you
[10:04] <vixus> I did.
[10:04] <vixus> Ok, I checked my xorg.conf, the driver is definitely nvidia, but my monitor still won't turn on... X is running, sounds coming fine but somehow I can't see anything. I am on a laptop.
[10:04] <Mazingaro> vega-: ubuntu is just a crap :)
[10:04] <axolx> hey guys - i convinced my sister to use ubuntu (im a debian user). she installed Edgy but the installer did not reformat a NTFS partition. is there a friendly partitioner that comes with ubuntu that she can use to reformat the NTFS partition to EXT3? i dont want to tell her to use fdisk because i dont want to scare hey yet :)
[10:04] <mobile> dfwlinuxguy no i install nothing. is it necessary to build a module? with th ubuntu kernel it works out of the box
[10:04] <deacont23> Is there a updated naim package available? the universe one is old
[10:04] <psusi> aragorn_: I assume you are booting from a disk other than the raid array right?
[10:04] <Mazingaro> please I've got a problem with an usb cam (Quick Cam Chat from logitech). I loaded the spca5xx module and enbale v4l in X, but no /dev/video it's created by udev. Even creating by hand it make it worked...
[10:04] <aragorn_> psusi: yes I'm running edgy and yes I've already tried to install again the package..
[10:04] <vixus> dfwlinuxguy: Happy? :D
[10:04] <padavoine> mazingaro : come on man its free, its great, it's not windows, you can't say it's crap ;-)
[10:04] <mobile> axolx qparted ?
[10:04] <psusi> axolx: gparted
[10:04] <ambimom> axolx:  take it from me...tell your sister to install dapper...it's easier and less buggy\
[10:04] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus...monitor turned on?
[10:05] <vixus> dfwlinuxguy: Laptop.
[10:05] <axolx> mobile: psusi : is it installed with the default edgy desktop installation?
[10:05] <ulaas> dfwlinuxguy: good one :)
[10:05] <dfwlinuxguy> mobile...yes you must install the new modules for the new kernel you built
[10:05] <network-coder> algum br ?
[10:05] <psusi> axolx: it is installed on the livecd
[10:05] <ulaas> vixus: even better :)
[10:05] <vixus> dfwlinuxguy: Presumably my monitor is glowing slightly, so it's on, and I'm writing this in text mode now so it's on.
[10:05] <ubun> is there a way for gnome-terminal to save 'sessions' like firefox 2.0 does. where it will remember my tabs and what i last had running?
[10:05] <fetus> Question : how to install xubuntu with cd rom boot up but from the internet?
[10:05] <cfd90> Please work :P Please work! :P
[10:05] <ambimom> ubun:  yes extension is session manager
[10:06] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus...did you see the X try to start?
[10:06] <Dybber> psusi, now ubuntu was just selected as default instead of windows (thats a good thing) but it still doesnt boot automatically. I tried booting several times and it looks like there are som text shown in a  second in the bottom of the screen saying something about ".10 seconds"
[10:06] <pike_> vixus: alt-ctrl-f2   login  then sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:06] <mobile> dfwlinuxguy is the module standard in the ubuntu kernel ?
[10:06] <Dybber> some*
[10:06] <psusi> aragorn_: is this a raid0 or a raid1?  and you are booting from a non raid disk right?
[10:06] <lupine_85> omgomgooops
[10:06] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus are you using the nv driver or the nvidia?
[10:06] <nofeardjb> fetus: what do you mean from the internet?
[10:06] <ulaas> vixus: i feel totally helpy today. so get msg me on private so i will help.
[10:06] <feugan3333> Hi all. Does anyone know where I can find some relevant documentation on hotplug or udev. I want to be able to access data on my cell phone without being root. From what I've discovered I should use hotplug for this.
[10:06] <aragorn_> psusi: yes I've a PATA disk for linux and I want to access the windows partitions on the raid
[10:06] <aragorn_> psusi: it's a raid 0 (nvidia)
[10:06] <vixus> dfwlinuxguy: I assume it has started, in a way. The system didn't hang, go to console or spit up errors. I heard the ubuntu login noise, so I put in my user and pass, and sure enough, it logged me in. Just no visuals.
[10:06] <psusi> Dybber: are you touching the keyboard at all?  it stops the timeout if you press any key
[10:06] <fetus> nofeardjb: something like installing from windows when it boots up the installer and everything else downloads from repos online
[10:07] <ubun> ambimom where do i get the extention?
[10:07] <network-coder> What of channel ubuntu-br ?
[10:07] <lupine_85> I just deleted a BIND zone file... Any way to get it to regenerate the data? I have a master and slave server running with the zone loaded...
[10:07] <ambimom> from mozilla...go to mozilla site and look for add-ons
[10:07] <psusi> aragorn_: strange.... it should work....
[10:07] <ubun> ambimom no i meant for gnome-terminal not for firefox :P
[10:07] <ambimom> ubun:  installing extensions in firefox is easy
[10:07] <ambimom> ahhhh...sorry ubun
[10:07] <nofeardjb> fetus: not sure if i understand... do you want the install disk to install less packages?
[10:07] <vixus> dfwlinux: It must be something to do with my nvidia driver install.
[10:07] <GuestD59339> can I burn ubunto .iso in a dvd?
[10:08] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus..I use the nvidia driver...if that one doesn't work..try the nv driver...you can kill the X session (which should restart it) with alt-ctl-backspace
[10:08] <nofeardjb> fetus: like a barebones installation?
[10:08] <ubun> guest yes
[10:08] <ubun> you can even burn the CD iso to dvd, that's what i did
[10:08] <dfwlinuxguy> moble...anytime you build a custom kernel...you have to also install the modules for that new kernel
[10:08] <fetus> nofeardjb: sorry ... found it :D https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[10:08] <vixus> dfwlinuxguy: Isn't that the one that comes with Ubuntu?
[10:08] <nofeardjb> there ya go
[10:08] <aragorn_> psusi: I'm crying...
[10:08] <fetus> nofeardjb: thanks anyways .. just didnt see it on the installation page ...
[10:08] <nofeardjb> fetus: i was about to send you there lol
[10:08] <GuestD59339> what's the best ubuntu version for amd64 3500, 1gb ram, nvidia graphic card?
[10:09] <vixus> dfwlinuxguy: I've never ever had to use it on any of my installs I don't think
[10:09] <mc__> GuestD59339: are you new to linux?
[10:09] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus....nv is the open source driver...nvidia is the proprietary nvidia driver
[10:09] <ReWT_AxS> im getting error:   Internal Error Failed to Initialize HAL!
[10:09] <psusi> aragorn_: can you pastebin /var/log/messages?
[10:09] <fetus> nofeardjb: i was looking and looking and finally thought i was dumb like shit ... because i allready done it once but couldnt remember the name ...
[10:09] <ReWT_AxS> Any ideas?
[10:09] <Dybber> psusi, im not touching it my self - but it looks as if i did (this works on my stationary PC so I know how the grub-menu behaves normally)
[10:09] <ubun> is xorg pronounced zorg?
[10:10] <mc__> ubun: nope

[10:10] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus...I remember something like that on my ati card...I had to comment out dri in xorg.conf ....alt-ctl-backspace
[10:10] <nofeardjb> ya do a  /register
[10:11] <vixus> dfwlinuxguy: Going back via ctrl-alt-f7 doesn't work.
[10:11] <aragorn_> psusi: I'm trying :)
[10:11] <ulaas> vixus: msg me when you are desperate enough
[10:11] <cyber_brain_mfkg> nofeardjb: and ehat now?
[10:11] <cyber_brain_mfkg> *what
[10:11] <vixus> ulaas: Sure.
[10:11] <Dybber> psusi, maybe its the hardware that sends a signal of somekind that shouldn't be send - i will try to get my "local" linux expert to look at this when i meet him :) I think its pretty difficult to fix this when you can't see it yourself?
[10:11] <nofeardjb> did you register?

[10:13] <Music_Shuffle> GuestD59339, with some configuration, yes...its not completely automatic.
[10:13] <mc__> cyber_brain_mfkg: that was wrong
[10:13] <Music_Shuffle> But its very simple, yes.
[10:13] <mc__> cyber_brain_mfkg: did you read what /msg NickServ help says?
[10:13] <nofeardjb> isn't it "/register <password>" ?
[10:13] <cyber_brain_mfkg> mc__: yes but after i did that

[10:19] <brianMan> Preferably something that can be configured somewhat through a webinterface
[10:19] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie...look for this --- username map = /etc/samba/smbusers --- that has to be in there since you are getting that error
[10:19] <WizCraker> Catshrimp: thanks for the quick reply. :)
[10:19] <stazi> Catshrimp, i think there is a package to make OOo use gnome's theming
[10:19] <Catshrimp> WizCraker: no prob dude :)

[10:24] <dfwlinuxguy> kuene...move /usr/share/applications/yelp.desktop to your home folder to save it or just delete it and it will be gone
[10:24] <aragorn_> psusi: I've pasted it :)
[10:24] <n2diy_> Vixus, the name of the module?
[10:24] <Vixus> any idea how to add custom screen resolutions? (Oh great, now the screen resolutions dialog is showing 0Hz refresh rate)
[10:24] <jerp> kuene, try Synaptic  Look for Ubuntu-Docs
[10:24] <fetus> Xubuntu .... minimalCD (netboot) ... install ... anyone??
[10:24] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus..how did you fix it?
[10:24] <pike_> !install | fetus
[10:24] <ubotu> fetus: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[10:24] <jerp> if that doesn't do it, you can always reinstall it
[10:24] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, I changed nvidia to nv.
[10:25] <dfwlinuxguy> cool
[10:25] <pike_> fetus: id recommend server install then xubuntu apt-get
[10:25] <kuene> dfwlinuxguy, i have tried this, does not work.
[10:25] <psusi> aragorn_: url?
[10:25] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, But now I don't think my card is being used at all. scrolling is unsmooth and there's no nvidia splashscreen
[10:25] <fetus> pike_ : ok ... how to install server?
[10:25] <pike_> fetus: the link above gives many options
[10:25] <rulus> fetus: can be done via Alternate install cd
[10:25] <kuene> jerp, i to not want to uninstall it i just do not want this menu!
[10:25] <aragorn_> psusi: ops :) http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36703/
[10:25] <dfwlinuxguy> you only see the splash screen with the propreitary nvidia driver
[10:26] <SambaNEWBIE> dwflinuxguy - I cannot find the line in the smb.conf file.
[10:26] <fetus> pike_: i only can use minimalcd meaning to download everything over the net whil installing
[10:26] <ReWT_AxS> im getting error:   Internal Error Failed to Initialize HAL!
[10:26] <ReWT_AxS> Any ideas?
[10:26] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, Which is what I should be using, according to the guide. It's also what I've used on all my other Ubuntu installs.
[10:26] <Vixus> So basically--- I'm not using my card
[10:26] <dfwlinuxguy> that is the best one to use
[10:26] <kuene> dfwlinuxguy, it does not work because help is a .directory or category i dont really understand this...
[10:27] <dirle> one of many other things I like about ubuntu (linux) is that I finaly get a quiet PC.. no more background running processes :)
[10:27] <pike_> fetus: see advanced section of first link
[10:27] <dirle> wanted to share that with you.. heh
[10:27] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus...try commenting out dri in xorg.conf and change it back to nvidia and restart X
[10:27] <ulaas> Vixus: ready?
[10:27] <Vixus> ulaas: I'll just follow this bit of advice from dfwlinuxguy
[10:27] <Vixus> then maybe
[10:27] <fetus> pike_: i'm using this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD ... but need to know how to initiate server install once the cd boots up
[10:27] <ulaas> Vixus: take your time...
[10:28] <dfwlinuxguy> ulass..do you know what his problem is?
[10:28] <ulaas> dfwlinuxguy: no luck with prop. driver.?
[10:28] <xipietotec> anyone? the name of the program that auto-detects cameras?
[10:28] <pike_> fetus: oh, well you probably just need to type server at boot prompt but i never used that cd
[10:29] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, Section "DRI" \ Mode 0666 \ End Section?
[10:29] <fetus> pike_: i'm gonna try ... thats my thought also
[10:29] <feugan3333> Vixus: nv driver does not use 3d acceleration.
[10:29] <fetus> pike_: thanks bye
[10:29] <dfwlinuxguy> ulaas..he changed it to nv from nvidia because he couldn't get X going...I'm trying to help him get back nvidia
[10:29] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, Whoops, dpkg-reconfigure changed my driver to mesa
[10:29] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus...no not that one
[10:29] <stazi> found a solution: http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2006/10/ubuntu_edgy_install_frustratio.html
[10:29] <ulaas> dfwlinuxguy: i can see that.
[10:29] <Everflex> When i follow this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem, and back up from the tar file i made, will then EVERYTHING i did not include in the update be deleted, even though i make the update on top of a working system?
[10:30] <adaptr> Adam_G: login how - ssh ?
[10:30] <adaptr> sorry.... lagging here ;-)
[10:30] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus..under section module ---  Load    "dri"
[10:30] <Adam_G> adaptr, yes - that's okay :D
[10:30] <dirle> for all the admins here.. I am new at Ubuntu but don't have any adaptation problem as a extensive windows user.. anyway.. on my main problem of dual booting vista with ubuntu it seems I can't get around it with GRUB.. and the only safe way to do it is to use a floppy boot disk for ubuntu.. is what I will attend to do now.. I will post in the help forums about it when I will get a resolution regarding my specific case
[10:30] <Everflex> Like: if i excluded Desktop in the backup, will it then be deleted when i restore the backup?
[10:30] <psusi> aragorn_: you aren't running a custom kernel are you?
[10:30] <cfd90> Now that I'm on Edgy, where is a link to install Beryl on 64 bit edgy?
[10:30] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, It's not there
[10:30] <cfd90> I've been looking, and I can't find a good guide.
[10:31] <cfd90> All the repos are gone it seems that I've tried :|
[10:31] <aragorn_> psusi: I'm using the default generic kernel
[10:31] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus...when you do the dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg..besure to select either nv or nvidia..not mesa
[10:31] <bXi> cfd90: there is 1 guide with correct install commands and another one with good repositories
[10:31] <cfd90> Where is that? :P;
[10:31] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, I ran nvidia-xconfig again.
[10:31] <bXi> dunno
[10:31] <psusi> aragorn_: and you are sure that you downloaded the .deb from the bug report and dpkg -i it?
[10:31] <bXi> but i'll msg you the repos
[10:31] <cfd90> Ok, cool :)
[10:31] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, It's back to how it was but I want to make sure it doesn't blankscreen again
[10:31] <cfd90> Edgy 64 bit?
[10:31] <n2diy_> Does the MinimalCD install give you X?
[10:31] <Chucknorrislol> can someone help me get madwifi running? i tried extracting it but i got a bunch of errors, it told me it didn't want to overwrite previous files or something? although i was installing to a new directory...
[10:32] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus..that is for the nvidia driver..I haven't tried nvidia-xconfig before
[10:32] <xipietotec> anyone? the name of the program that auto-detects cameras?
[10:32] <Vixus> Well, it wouldn't let me do nvidia-glx-config
[10:32] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg has always worked for me
[10:32] <pike_> xipietotec: webcams?
[10:33] <Vixus> dfwlinuxguy, hold on, let me
[10:33] <jerp> kuene, think with me here now;  If the only way to remove it is to uninstall it, isn't that removing it from the menu list?  And if it's removed, it also doesn't mean you can't re-install.
[10:33] <xipietotec> pike_: any camera, when I plugged in my old camera, this gui box came up and looked to auto-configure, my new camera is having some issues...and that box doesn't pop up
[10:33] <aragorn_> psusi: yes I'm sure! I used this deb dmraid_1.0.0.rc11-1_i386.deb
[10:33] <dfwlinuxguy> vixus...I have nvidia and the modules I have loaded are bitmap...ddc...dri...extmod...freetype...glx...int10...type1...vbe
=== djihed is now known as kalila
[10:33] <psusi> aragorn_: that is not the right one... the one attached to the bug report is -13 not 11
[10:33] <dfwlinuxguy> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg will ask which modules to load
[10:34] <cfd90> Does Edgy come with AIXGLX?
[10:34] <bXi> cfd90: got my message?
[10:34] <dfwlinuxguy> yes it does bXi
[10:34] <cfd90> No... :|
[10:34] <cfd90> Can you just write it out here?  Irssi seems to be having trouble
[10:34] <dfwlinuxguy> sorry cfd90
[10:34] <bXi> deb http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz edgy main-edgy main-edgy-amd64
[10:34] <bXi> deb http://media.blutkind.org/xgl/ edgy main-edgy main-edgy-amd64
[10:34] <bXi> those 2
[10:34] <xipietotec> I just need to know the name of that program, so I can troubleshoot
[10:34] <cfd90> Hmmm, I thought I tried them, but I'll try again
[10:35] <dfwlinuxguy> don't use compiz
[10:35] <dfwlinuxguy> use beryl instead
[10:35] <Chucknorrislol> can someone help me get madwifi running? i tried extracting it but i got a bunch of errors, it told me it didn't want to overwrite previous files or something? although i was installing to a new directory...
[10:35] <cfd90> Where are the Beryl things? I can't find any :P
[10:35] <bXi> those include beryl
[10:35] <cfd90> Ooh
[10:35] <levander> Does FireFox 2 in Edgy hang a lot for other people?
[10:35] <bXi> levander: not really
[10:35] <xipietotec> cfd90: join #ubuntu-xgl, berl is in the chanserv title
[10:35] <xipietotec> beryl
[10:35] <dfwlinuxguy> deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ edgy main ..in /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:36] <levander> bXi: maybe i'll install the one from backports and see if i have better luck
[10:36] <aragorn_> psusi: I only found -11 in https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/dmraid/+bug/54246
[10:36] <kleftisx> hello.....how i can install Borland C++ or something similar with Borland C++ on Ubuntu?
[10:37] <levander> Also, I got a disk full error trying to download something with azureus.  I made empty space on the hard drive.  But, now when azureus starts up, it core dumps.
[10:37] <dfwlinuxguy> kleftisx...try eclipse ...eclipse.org
[10:37] <bXi> levander: are you running 32 bit or 64 bit
[10:37] <VrilutZa> kleftisx apt-get install build-essential
[10:37] <levander> I'm wondering if I can clear the state of the old file it was downloading, if it will stop core dumping, but I don't know how.
[10:37] <levander> bXi: 32 bit
[10:37] <bXi> levander: then my next suggestion is useless :)
[10:37] <psusi> aragorn_: look again.. .-13 is there... it's linked to in the last post

[10:38] <tdd1984> guys i got a big problem I can get linux to boot up, alls im getting is the shell prompt

[10:39] <JebJoya> hey, my Ubuntu running laptop has suddenly stopped accessing the internet through it's PCMCIA card as of today - it is still claiming to be connected to the network, and the router is listing it as a client, but am having no access to the internet - another PC connecting wirelessly to the same router is getting access though.  My laptop was working as of last night, any suggestions of checks...
[10:39] <JebJoya> ...I can make to find out what has gone wrong?
[10:39] <psusi> aragorn_: err damnit... nevermind... that was a bad one too ;)
[10:39] <JebJoya> (apologies for the long post)
[10:39] <SambaNEWBIE> dwflinuxguy - any other ideas? The line doesn't exist in the .conf file?
[10:39] <dfwlinuxguy> kleftisx... you can do apt-cache search eclipse to find all the eclipse packages available to install..apt-get install pkgname will install it
[10:39] <Crazyl1nk> im have a sound/mic problem, for some reason programs such as Skype, or teamspeak says im either, Haveing problems with sound device(skype) or my mic and speakers are muted(teamspeak) is this a problem someone else has had, and can it be fixed?
[10:39] <Pelo> JebJoya,  have you tried the forum ?
[10:40] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie..have you tried restarting samba?
[10:40] <kdjfs> can ntfs-3g change read/write access on edgy amd64?

[10:40] <dfwlinuxguy> /etc/init.d/samba stop|start
[10:40] <SambaNEWBIE> dwflinuxguy - I have typed smbd reload after each change to the .conf file.
[10:40] <Pelo> JebJoya,  I'm thinking exactly the reverse
[10:40] <aragorn_> psusi: I tried it some times ago (I'm Enrico Sardi on launchpad ) and it doesn't work for me...
[10:41] <aragorn_> psusi: it didn't populate my /dev/mapper
[10:41] <dfwlinuxguy> ok..what does your err log say when you try to log in?
[10:41] <JebJoya> Pelo: okeydokey, any suggestions on search terms?
[10:41] <psusi> aragorn_: yea... don't use the one I tried to modify
[10:41] <psusi> aragorn_: that was a failed experiment
[10:41] <Crazyl1nk> i have a question/problem
[10:41] <JebJoya> Pelo: the strange thing was that it was working up until last night, then stopped for no apparent reason
[10:41] <Pelo> JebJoya,  pmcia network off ,  , no wireless internet , etc
[10:42] <Pelo> JebJoya, could be an ip issue
[10:42] <levander> Can somebody put a "where to go" entry in ubotu?  Like, if you can't find your answer in #ubuntu, check ubuntuforums, the freenode channel for the application you are having trouble with if one exists, and the developers themself at their web site?  I just seem to type that out a lot when I'm in here.

[10:50] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie...I just new that if that line wasn't in there and if samba was properly restarted it shouldn't give that error
[10:50] <dfwlinuxguy> sambanewbie...no problem..best wishes

[10:52] <ryanakca> how do I fix "hostname -f"? I currently get "hostname: Unknown host". "hostname" outputs "rkavanagh"
[10:52] <psusi> aragorn_: yea, you need to be using rc13
[10:52] <Arwen> is there a list of newly released/updated packages for edgy somewhere?
[10:52] <Lam_> i need a program to check to see if a hard drive is potentially failing
[10:52] <juraj> I'm using edgy eft. When I open the software sources dialog from synaptic I can choose a mirror, however I can't choose my country. It just lists united states
[10:52] <Lam_> suggestions?
[10:52] <juraj> where can I change my system's country?
[10:53] <Arwen> Lam_, stress testing a possibly failing hard drive could push it over the edge
[10:53] <Lam_> Arwen: what can i do then?
[10:53] <Arwen> Lam_, test it.... but make sure to backup
[10:53] <Crazyl1nk> can someone please help me?
[10:54] <dou213_> !ask
[10:54] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:54] <shwag> I want to setup the Linked Tables feature of phpmyadmin, but the package installed with apt-get is missing the  create_tables.sql file that was suppose to be in scripts/
[10:54] <Stormx2> He did ask.
[10:54] <juraj> so can anyone help me? where to change my system's country?
[10:54] <Stormx2> Crazyl1nk: Tried posting a topic on the forums?
[10:55] <Stormx2> juraj: isn't it a setting in gnome?
[10:55] <aragorn_> psusi: you don't have a compiled version ready? ;)
[10:55] <Arwen> Lam_, are you *running* from this failing system?
[10:55] <Crazyl1nk> running though Forums to see if anyone has had same problem, i may have just fixed my teamspeak problems but skype is another story
[10:55] <juraj> well, I don't know where is that setting located so I can select mirrors for my country, in Synaptic
[10:55] <psusi> aragorn_: not for i386, I run amd64
=== dou213_ is now known as dou213
[10:55] <JebJoya> Pelo: still having issues - nothing on the forums which seem to be referring to the specific issue i'm getting
[10:55] <Arwen> juraj, does your country have mirrors?
[10:56] <psusi> aragorn_: I'll see if I can get some pressure on to get proper binaries in the edgy-backports repository
[10:56] <juraj> yes it has, on the other installation of edgy it offers me mirrors for croatia
[10:56] <juraj> however on this installation I can select only for US
[10:56] <kritical> Can anyone recommend an open-source boot cd designed to test hardware?
[10:56] <psusi> or possibly just outright updated in the main repo, since the released one was so hosed
[10:56] <juraj> you know, the graphical dialog for setting up repositories
[10:57] <juraj> I don't know where it is set up so it thinks that I'm in US
[10:57] <dougsko> juraj: check out the man page for 'locale'
[10:57] <aragorn_> psusi: that would be wonderful :)
[10:58] <lazy> !
[10:58] <lazy>  ?
[10:58] <juraj> right, everything is set to en_US...
[10:58] <JebJoya> So, I guess I'll put this to anyone else - sony vaio laptop (2 yrs oldish), linksys pcmcia 802.11b wireless card (RTL8180), was accessing internet fine yesterday, suddenly stopped today for some reason, system thinks it's connected to the network, router thinks it's connected (listed on active clients), connection seems to go in little bursts of 1packet up+down every second or so when I try...
[10:58] <JebJoya> ...to do anything, but absolutely no internet (ping just dies)
[10:58] <lazy> ok
[10:58] <juraj> I still want to keep english in Gnome, just change it so I can select my mirror
[10:58] <Lam__> Arwen: i was. i have reason to believe my main drive is failing now. kde reports a malformatted error before breaking down completely and freezing on itself. my backup is on my secondary drive so it should all be ok
[10:58] <Lam__> Arwen: it just froze on me, so i'm on my laptop now
[10:59] <shwag> phpmyadmin is pretty out of date on ubuntu.
[10:59] <kritical> Can anyone recommend an open-source boot cd designed to test hardware?
[10:59] <juraj> I'm going to file a bug, as this is an annoyance in synaptic
[10:59] <Arwen> Lam_, have you forced an fsck? it might be a filesystem and not a hardware error
[10:59] <shwag> 2.8.0.3  vs   2.9.1.1
[10:59] <Music_Shuffle> juraj, what's a bug?
[10:59] <WizCraker> does ubuntu store the apache info in httpd.conf or someplace else?  i'm looking where I should put the virtualhost stuff at.
[10:59] <mlalkaka> has anyone been able to get sleep (suspend-to-ram) and hibernate (suspend-to-disk) working on edgy? when i press suspend on the log out menu, it just locks the screen; and when i unlock the screen, there's a message saying that supending failed
[10:59] <SneeRR> Hi! how to mount and write on reiser4 fs
[10:59] <SneeRR> ?
[10:59] <Lam__> Arwen: i haven't done anything. it was working perfectly fine, and then a i hear a verbal click from the tower before the system malformats on itself
[10:59] <juraj> /usr/bin/software-properties is only offering mirrors for currently selected locale
[11:00] <Arwen> Lam_, click? ok - your machine is dying - buy a new HDD
[11:00] <juraj> what if I want to select the other mirror? I need to mess with locales?
[11:00] <Lam__> Arwen: ok i suspected as much. do you know what the average lifespan of a hard drive by chance? my tower is about 5 years old now
[11:00] <SneeRR> Any ideas what I should install to use reiser4?
[11:00] <Arwen> Lam_, or... wait... the diagnostic app will be available from the manufacturer of your HD - an HD lasts between 3-10 years
[11:00] <dougsko> WizCraker: the apache config files should be somewhere like, /etc/apache2
[11:00] <lazy> on some ftp servers i can see that ISO images is differ by size...
[11:00] <aragorn_> psusi: and with .13 it might start at the boot?
[11:00] <lupine_85> Lam__: it should have an MTBF (mean time before failure) somewhere...
[11:01] <lazy> edgy
[11:01] <Music_Shuffle> Lam__, depends...this machine has a new HDD, but the othe rone runs fine...after 8 years...
[11:01] <Music_Shuffle> other one*
[11:01] <Arwen> SneeRR, reiser4progs and then get the patch from the reiser site
[11:01] <JebJoya> noone any ideas on the wireless issue?
[11:01] <Lam__> Arwen: i'll just buy a new drive. it's not like my main drive needs a whole lot of gigabytes since my secondary is the backup
[11:01] <SneeRR> Arwen Path is in deb format? What is the link of the site
[11:01] <Lam__> Arwen: thanks

[11:02] <blackflare> is there a command like ctrl alt delete for when the system locks up?
[11:03] <ubun> ctrl+alt+backspace
[11:03] <WizCraker> dougsko: does it matter which one I use?  there is apache2.conf httpd.conf ports.conf (this one is obvious of what it does)
[11:03] <SneeRR> Arwen thank you !!!
[11:03] <dougsko> WizCraker: apache2.conf is the right one, i believe. you should familiarize youself with all of those htough
[11:04] <dougsko> WizCraker: if you read though them, youll see what theyre for. theyre all commented
[11:04] <sjbrown> in ubuntu 6.10, when i Ctrl-N it shows me a dropdown of options, it doesn't do this in ubuntu 6.06
[11:04] <sjbrown> how do i turn this feature on?
[11:04] <blackflare> is there a way to reset the sounds settings to default?
[11:04] <nder> I want to install ubuntu over windows. It's asking how do I want to partition disk
[11:04] <WizCraker> dougsko: I briefly read through them, I was just making sure before I messed something up.
[11:04] <nder> clean ak disk option?
[11:04] <nder> all*
[11:05] <JebJoya> ooh, anyone know if my DHCP clients table listing the main pc (Fujitsu) as both 192.168.1.100 and ...101, with my laptop not being listed on the table (yet being given ...101) could be my issue (not an ubuntu issue i know, but if anyone has an idea, it'd be greatly appreciated)
[11:05] <Arwen> Lam_, you might try sticking your hdd in your freezer for around 30 min - might help or might pwn your hdd for good
[11:05] <dougsko> WizCraker: dont worry, you got it
[11:05] <carlo> ciao
[11:05] <JebJoya> however it's listing the MAC of my laptop card with the name of the other pc
[11:05] <carlo> ragazzi mi date qualche repository?
[11:06] <Music_Shuffle> !it
[11:06] <ubotu> Vai su #ubuntu-it o su #kubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[11:06] <mt3> Hi people
[11:07] <feugan3333> JebJoya: What command are you running to get this info. Could you post it?
[11:07] <mt3> I'm trying to switch my brother to Ubuntu 6.10 rather than buying him this ridiculous Windows Vista
[11:07] <weswh->  i have an HFS (macosx) partition that i want to get my data off of. when i mount it (even with uid=1000, read only) i can access the mount, but most of the folders have 'lock' icons on them. permission denied. if i access it with kdesu konqueror, i can't copy files to my drive. it says they do not exist. when i tried cp from a clean root shell, it says 'ommiting folder', and quits.
[11:07] <Music_Shuffle> mt3, shouldn't be that hard.
[11:07] <mt3> Only things he wants that he can't get native are World of Warcraft and Windows Live Messenger
[11:07] <Music_Shuffle> mt3, Windows Messenger...KMess.
[11:07] <weswh-> anyone have any ideas? i don't know if it is inheriting permissions from the macos system or what. it's an external firewire harddrive. when i was in there with kdesu i could play mp3s off of it and such. how can i play a file, but not copy the file? :/
[11:08] <mt3> I've heard that both of these can run under Ubuntu is this so?
[11:08] <JebJoya> fraid not, i'm using the main pc to get the info, my laptop (with ubuntu) is not able to connect properly - i'm just connecting to 192.168.1.1 through firefox and browsing the menus (sorry, lame i know :P)
[11:08] <feugan3333> mt3: Wine should be able to play wow
[11:08] <rem_> weswh -> cp -r
[11:08] <deep__> what was the command to count lines from an output?
[11:08] <Music_Shuffle> And WoW can be played, yes mt3.
[11:08] <pike_> mt3: wow works with cedega for each release ive heard
[11:08] <mt3> He wants the proper Windows Live Messenger though. He wants to be able to use webcam, MSN games, emoticons, all that crap
[11:08] <weswh-> rem - even if i mounted with -r?
[11:08] <dfwlinuxguy> mt3 gaim is better than msn
[11:08] <Music_Shuffle> Yes it is better.
[11:08] <nder> can anyone help me? what do I choose? clean entire disk?
[11:09] <tx22> Guys this has nothing to do with ubuntu, but I need to know how paypal works. my friend wants to pay me and I said i have paypal ( i use ebay) but i don't know where/how he does it
[11:09] <rem_> -r means recursive..so it will copy the content of the folder ..
[11:09] <Music_Shuffle> nder, why clean the entire disk again?
[11:09] <mt3> Does it support custom emoticons, webcam, msn ames, etc.
[11:09] <ahaller> how can i turn bluetooth/wifi on and of to save battery power?
[11:09] <oslo> does someone success to use gmailfs ??
[11:09] <Music_Shuffle> mt3, yes, yes, yes.
[11:09] <nder> install linux over windows
[11:09] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh- use a terminal to check the permissions of the files on the external drive
[11:09] <mc__> tx22: please ask that in #ubuntu-offtopic
[11:09] <somerville32> tx22: See http://paypal.com for help on using paypal.
[11:09] <deep__> what was the command to count lines from an output?
[11:09] <chable> anyone knows how ti fix a bug in horde ?
[11:09] <chable> to* fix
[11:09] <mt3> Ok then I'll set him up this weekend and we can see what happens
[11:09] <Music_Shuffle> !dualboot | nder
[11:09] <ubotu> nder: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[11:09] <feugan3333> JebJoya: I don't really understand you problem. If you like you can pm me
[11:09] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: what is that command?
[11:09] <rem_> cp -r -v if you want details on what its copying while its copying ..
[11:09] <mt3> On 6.10 Gaim comes as standard right? and OpenOffice?
[11:10] <nder> but I want just linux running
[11:10] <Music_Shuffle> mt3, yeah. And on 6.01 actually. OO requires install I think.
[11:10] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh- ls -al /media/whatever
[11:10] <Music_Shuffle> nder, it...is running then.
[11:10] <dfwlinuxguy> df will tell you where it's mounted
[11:10] <Music_Shuffle> nder, oh, you mean no windows?
[11:10] <Chucknorrislol> ubuntu refuses to recognize my wireless card.... what can i do? i'm using xubuntu edgy and i have a TEW-441PC card (atheros chipset)
[11:10] <nder> yes
[11:10] <feugan3333> mt3: OO is standard but not gaim
[11:10] <JebJoya> oh god, i've found the problem
[11:10] <Music_Shuffle> nder, then on the partition editor just select 'Erase entire' or whatever the wording is.
[11:10] <JebJoya> and what a surprise, it wasn't linux at fault
[11:10] <JebJoya> :)
[11:11] <nder> ok thank you
[11:11] <mt3> Ok is Gaim easily added ont he add/remove apps thing? or do I need to download it and compile?
[11:11] <Lam__> i'm pretty sure that it's my main drive, but just to make sure, kde isn't suppose to crash even if your secondary drive (the one without kde installed on it) fails, right?  i assumed it's my main drive because kde crashed when i heard the click
[11:11] <feugan3333> mt3: It gets installed via a package manager
[11:11] <mt3> Also, anyone know if the Netgear WG311 is supported out of the box under 6.10? I know it wasn't under 5.10.
[11:11] <Shaba1> folks I am a windows systems admin
[11:11] <feugan3333> mt3: very easily
[11:11] <Music_Shuffle> feugan3333, it does come default >.>
[11:11] <Arwen> !ndiswrapper | Chucknorrislol
[11:11] <ubotu> Chucknorrislol: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:11] <ChrisBradley> How do I launch a program as another user from Gnome?
[11:11] <mt3> feugan3333: Ok then I should be fine getting that setup
[11:11] <mt3> Thanks
[11:11] <cybernet> wazz up !!!
[11:12] <dougsko> mt3: search for it in synaptic, or just type 'sudo aptget install gaim'
[11:12] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - chmod 0777 /media/whatever should allow you to read/write the files
[11:12] <Chucknorrislol> i've been pouring over that link for hours now, it's not helping me
[11:12] <deep__> what was the command to count lines from an output?
[11:12] <mt3> Netgear WG311 wifi card supported out the box anyone know?
[11:12] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: "501" is the owner. (when i look at the folder under konqueror, it reports as a "locked folder" (though as root i can see the contents and execute them)
[11:12] <Chucknorrislol> i've also used ndiswrapper for the windows XP driver i got on the card's CD, but it said the driver is invalid
[11:12] <ahaller> mt3: Gaim and Openoffice are installed by default
[11:12] <Shaba1> I know you can enable automatic login with gnome.
[11:12] <rem_> deep wc -l ... ?!
[11:12] <feugan3333> Music_Shuffle: it is under the optional section.
[11:12] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - of course you will have to use sudo if you aren't root
[11:12] <deep__> okay, thanx.
[11:12] <deep__> :D
[11:12] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - sudo chmod 0777 /media/whatever should allow you to read/write the files
[11:12] <Shaba1> How does one get that to query and authenticate to a AD server?
[11:12] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: know what 501 is? and, if i do the chmod, is that permanent on the drive, or only for this mount?
[11:13] <JebJoya> wow - what a surprise - problem fixed and it wasn't linux at fault :)
[11:13] <JebJoya> just a very silly router
[11:13] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - only for that mount!
[11:13] <mt3> Anyone?
[11:13] <Music_Shuffle> feugan3333, its definitely default. I always straight click through, and I have it every time.
[11:13] <rem_> weswh do a chmod -R 777 on the folder as root ..
[11:13] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - sudo chown yourusername:yourusername /media/whatever should work too
[11:13] <JebJoya> thanks everyone for your help
[11:13] <feugan3333> Music_Shuffle: Ok I'll take your word for it :-)
[11:13] <Music_Shuffle> ^_^

[11:13] <Chucknorrislol> anyone? this is a newbie problem, i'm sure if you guys take two min you can solve my problem :(
[11:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dualmonitor - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:14] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - 501 is the unix user on whatever unix system you used to copy the files onto the drive
[11:14] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - 501 probably doesn't exist on your ubuntu system
[11:14] <GeneralZarkawi> !ask
[11:14] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:14] <feugan3333> Chucknorrislol: Not if we don't know what your problem is.
[11:14] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: i see, yeah it was mac
[11:14] <InsertNickHere> ... Does anyone in here know of a good site where you learn how to make the second screen show something different from what's on the first one?

[11:17] <ubotu> GeneralZarkawi: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[11:17] <dfwlinuxguy> chucknorrislol...that means the driver for your wireless card is not loaded
[11:17] <uMISTA> how can i make all *.exe files have certin icons?

[11:18] <uMISTA> not not working
[11:18] <cypher1> ahh operapluginwrap is taking ~90% of CPU
[11:18] <feugan3333> lol
[11:18] <Chucknorrislol> dfwlinuxguy: ok, how do i do that?
[11:18] <dfwlinuxguy> do you know that your card is supported?
[11:18] <pike_> Chucknorrislol:  the `` or $() designate a terminal command the `` are not quotes but tildes i think theyre called
[11:19] <Chucknorrislol> it seems like my card is unrecognized so far... nothing i run says it recognizes my card
[11:19] <feugan3333> Chucknorrislol: Install the package pike told you to.
[11:19] <Chucknorrislol> i'm doing that right now ^_^
[11:20] <nder> what security programs should I use in ubuntu?
[11:20] <dfwlinuxguy> madwifi?
[11:20] <Chucknorrislol> ah... i'm not sure
[11:20] <Chucknorrislol> i've heard stuff about madwifi
[11:20] <GeneralZarkawi> nder, security programs?
[11:20] <Arwen> nder, um.... there's a lot of security programs
[11:20] <feugan3333> nder: depends on what you want to do.
[11:21] <nder> ANTIVIRUS
[11:21] <nder> firewall
[11:21] <GeneralZarkawi> nder, HAHAHAHAAH
[11:21] <Chucknorrislol> i tried wrapping the windows XP driver that came on my card's installation CD... it said it was invalid
[11:21] <dfwlinuxguy> what package did he tell you to install?
[11:21] <nder> anti-spyware
[11:21] <Arwen> nder, what do you do? ubuntu is secure out of the box... av is generally unnecessary.... and there's no such thing as linux spyware
[11:21] <dfwlinuxguy> did you use ndiswrapper to do that?
[11:21] <nder> oh thanx sorry I'm noob:P
[11:21] <Chucknorrislol> pike: package installed
[11:22] <feugan3333> Arwen: Ubuntu does not come with a firewall installed, so how can it be secure out of the box?
[11:22] <beibei> how can I install slype? I have only got ubuntu last night
[11:22] <Arwen> feugan3333, err.... it does
[11:22] <Arwen> feugan3333, *iptables*
[11:22] <lymz> hi, for some reason the flash plugin in firefox doesn't display any fonts
[11:22] <GeneralZarkawi> feugan3333, personal firewalls don't make a distribution safer
[11:22] <Kingsqueak> also if you have nothing to connect *to* you have nothing to firewall anyway
[11:22] <Arwen> nder, if you have broadband - buy yourself a router with nat+spi
[11:22] <feugan3333> Arwen: Yes but it is allow all, which is the same as no firewall
[11:22] <pike_> Chucknorrislol: might be all you need to do.  reboot might be easiest thing now
[11:22] <dfwlinuxguy> feugan3333...do a netstat -a | grep LISTEN that will tell you all the ports that are open
[11:22] <Arwen> feugan3333, incorrect, ubuntu is preconfigured to disallow all inbound
[11:22] <nuked_omen> i use linux because i don't want to install antivirus, antispyware, antimaleware just to be able to use a computer securely
[11:22] <Chucknorrislol> ok. if it doesn't work i guess i'll be back
[11:23] <Arwen> feugan3333, try iptables -L
[11:23] <pike_> good luck :)
[11:23] <feugan3333> BS!
[11:23] <Tobyman> Bye All and once again Thx a lot for your help

[11:23] <Shaba1> I did ubotu and did not get and answer.
[11:23] <feugan3333> Arwen: I had to set up my own rules
[11:23] <ahaller> lymz, maybe the fonts are not embedded in the flashmovie. try installing mscorefonts.
[11:24] <beibei> how can I install Skype on UBUNTU
[11:24] <beibei> ?
[11:24] <lymz> ahaller: thanks, will try
[11:24] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh...that should get you going
[11:24] <JairunCaloth> Hey guys, I'm havnig a little trouble here. When I boot into Xubuntu for some reason right after X starts the processor is at 100% and stays there until I ctrl+ alt + backspace to restart it. I've also been having performance issues with games. I just updated the video driver, however that did not fix the problem.
[11:24] <Arwen> feugan3333, maybe if you need open ports.... I installed firestarter to deal with that... but it's below par
[11:24] <Mindcat> i have installed ubuntu (6.10) with alternate, since with desktop livecd xorg didn't work
[11:24] <Arwen> JairunCaloth, video card? have you adjusted your xorg.conf at all?
[11:25] <Galga> ubuntu 6.06 vs 6.10 ? internal modem support ?
[11:25] <Arwen> Galga, nope
[11:25] <Music_Shuffle> JairunCaloth, how long does it hang at that %?
[11:25] <feugan3333> Arwen: Maybe firestarter added the deny all, cause the default is allow all.
[11:25] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: hmm. at a first glance i don't seem to be able to access it through my standard user still. ls -al says they are still 501 501
[11:25] <Mindcat> i managed to do de text installation, but now when i start ubuntu i get a black screen
[11:25] <Arwen> Galga, even hardware internals
[11:25] <Galga> :(
[11:25] <Arwen> feugan3333, incorrect
[11:25] <JairunCaloth> Arwen, I was doing some stuff with dual moniters, but I did change back to my previous xorg.conf
[11:25] <Arwen> !firewall
[11:25] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[11:25] <JairunCaloth> Music: until I restart the x server
[11:25] <lymz> ahaller: mscorefonts are in multiverse, correct?
[11:25] <feugan3333> Arwen: not incorrect
[11:25] <Mindcat> just after "starting system..." disappears
[11:25] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /media/whatever

[11:26] <Mindcat> i have an ati mobility radeon x700
[11:26] <oslo> does someone here has already success to use gmailfs ??
[11:26] <frandavid100> hi
[11:26] <Music_Shuffle> !hi
[11:26] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[11:26] <deep__> Thanq :D
[11:26] <Mindcat> what can i do? can someone help me?
[11:27] <frandavid100> do you know why, if xinerama is enabled, windows are placed on the opposite space?
[11:27] <JairunCaloth> arwen: I was considering updateing to the latest release canidate for XFCE, however I don't know if that will have any effect on this problem
[11:27] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: hmm, this thing must be some kind of resilliant. just ran that...ohhh, none of it is working. read only file system
[11:27] <weswh-> i mounted it that way. doh
[11:28] <Arwen> JairunCaloth, latest... release candidate? um... and what might that be?
[11:28] <dfwlinuxguy> mount it rw
[11:28] <mobile> ERROR: Kernel configuration is invalid include/linux/autoconf.h or include/config/auto.conf are missing; modules will have no dependencies and modversions.
[11:28] <Mindcat> can someone help me please?
[11:28] <sharperguy> how do i get the collection to work in amarok (its asking me for a password to log into localhost:5432)
[11:28] <weswh-> just out of curiosity, if this doesn't actually change the ownership on the fs itself (just this mount session), why does it need w?
[11:28] <JairunCaloth> arwen RC 4.4 released 11/4
[11:28] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh none of those commands will work unless it is rw
[11:28] <JairunCaloth> arwen well RC2, XFCE 4.4
[11:28] <feugan3333> Arwen: Read the first line of this article: http://security.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/06/26/1556259&tid=13&tid=35
[11:28] <ahaller> lymz, oh i just see, that there might be another solution. look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats under flash... its msttcorefonts, yes in multiverse
[11:29] <zv> hi macd
[11:29] <Arwen> huh, iptables used to have deny inbound
[11:29] <Arwen> JairunCaloth, um.... the last stable is 6.10 final, released 10/something
[11:29] <Arwen> there's an alpha for 7.4 but you don't want it
[11:29] <ahaller> lymz, but maybe you dont neet msttcorefonts anymore, dont know really.
[11:29] <nuked_omen> can i ask to ask
[11:29] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: this look good - "sudo mount /dev/sda3 /media/firewire -rw -o uid=1000"? (not sure what the o is..i picked that up somewhere)
[11:29] <AtKaaZ> how do I disable console blanking, other than from /etc/console-tools/ which doesn't work
[11:29] <Arwen> feugan3333, ye ye... I coulda sworn it used to be on by default
[11:29] <lymz> where do i find mscorefonts?
[11:29] <lymz> is it msttcorefonts?
[11:29] <Chucknorrislol> i don't think it worked :(
[11:30] <Arwen> JairunCaloth, you probably shouldn't... someone else here might be more knowledged than me
[11:30] <JairunCaloth> arwen: I'm not refering to xubuntu, I'm talking about the desktop environment that xubuntu runs
[11:30] <Arwen> JairunCaloth, ah
[11:30] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh - mac's are also unix filesystems..your disk files were created to be read/write by user 501 on your mac...since user 501 does not exist on your ubuntu system..you have no permissions to write the files
[11:30] <aimtrainer> hi I have a bug related problem with my nvidia graphic driver. Does anyone know if there will soon be a new envy version which will update to the 1.0-9631nvidia driver *latest version(
[11:30] <nder> can I play counter-strike in ubuntu with cedega?
[11:30] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: i understand. i am just asking if changing the ownership is going to confuse the mac if i ever boot it up again :) i imagine so
[11:31] <pike_> lymz: i believe so
[11:31] <weswh-> but oh well

[11:31] <Arwen> nder, maybe
[11:31] <beibei> I am a beginner
[11:31] <feugan3333> nder: Yes, wine should work too
[11:31] <cafuego_> beibei: download the Ubuntu package from the skype website and double-click it.
[11:31] <aimtrainer> nder: I used to play cs under kanotix .. dont see why it shouldnt work with ubuntu
[11:31] <Chucknorrislol> feugan? pike? what do i do next?
[11:31] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh yes..that's why sudo chmod 0777 /media/firewire would work best if you are going to be moving it between systems
[11:31] <pike_> beibei: for all such questions wiki.ubuntu.com is a good place to search
[11:31] <ahaller> beibei, i just answered that question.
[11:32] <ahaller> beibei, just go to http://skype.com/download/skype/linux/ and install the debian package. try the wiki first. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
[11:32] <beibei> Thank you CAFUEGO, Gracias
[11:32] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh yes..that's why sudo chmod -R 0777 /media/firewire would work best if you are going to be moving it between systems
[11:32] <AtKaaZ> is there a way to search the channel logs?
[11:32] <dfwlinuxguy> you have to include the -R
[11:32] <beibei> THANK YOU ALL!!
[11:32] <feugan3333> nder: try http://appdb.winehq.org/ to see which apps will work on wine
[11:33] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: "sudo mount /dev/sda3 /media/firewire -rw -o uid=1000", mounting it with those options, it still thinks read only file system on the chmod or chown
[11:33] <roler> Hey guys. I have a Dell E1705 Laptop. Edgy runs great! THe only problem I have is that my subwoofer does not work. It uses an Intel HD Audio sound card... Anyone know of any patches to get it working?
[11:33] <AtKaaZ> what program is blanking the console?
[11:33] <weswh-> dfwlinuxguy: maybe HFS in linux doesn't support writing?
[11:33] <Arwen> weswh-, yes it does
[11:33] <Arwen> weswh-, try ls -l FILEONHFSPART

[11:33] <mobile> madwifi compile problem..
[11:33] <mobile> plz help :)
[11:33] <cafuego_> weswh-: It does, not not if you have journaling enabled on the hfs volume.
[11:34] <dfwlinuxguy> hfs is writable...hfs+ is not
[11:34] <Chucknorrislol> how do i get madwifi working:? i checked the documentation, but it tells me nothing i can understand. i have a TEW-441PC card that i can't make linux recognize
[11:34] <cafuego_> dfwlinuxguy: hfs+ *is* writeable.
[11:34] <nuked_omen> who is flooding the room now
[11:34] <somerville32> !netsplit
[11:34] <ubotu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[11:34] <JairunCaloth> holy netsplit batman
[11:34] <weswh-> well, i was running spotlight and all of that - so i imagine i had journaling on. don't have a mac anymore though, so i can't change it there...i was under the impression that it didn't support journaling in linux so it was just a wash
[11:34] <ahaller> AtKaaz, maybe try clear
[11:34] <cafuego_> surf's up!
[11:35] <Chucknorrislol> goddamn it.
[11:35] <weswh-> so is there just something wrong with my mount command then? or a problem with the fs/options or something, as to why it is read only?
[11:35] <Chucknorrislol> maybe i should go back to windows and enjoy microsoft owning my soul
[11:36] <dfwlinuxguy> weswh someone just said you could write to hfs+...I was under the impression that you couldn't
[11:36] <Shaba1> Well after using it for so many years I have gotten use to it.
[11:36] <AtKaaZ> ahaller: thanks but i'm looking to disable the console blanking after x minutes, i set it to off twice in /etc/console-tools/config, no luck;
[11:36] <weswh-> maybe the -o flag i have in the mount command is bad?
[11:36] <roler> Hey guys. I have a Dell E1705 Laptop. Edgy runs great! THe only problem I have is that my subwoofer does not work. It uses an Intel HD Audio sound card... Anyone know of any patches to get it working?
[11:36] <cafuego_> dfwlinuxguy: Provided you'rer not using journaling on hfs+, you can write to it from Linux.
[11:36] <weswh-> cafuego_: is journaling on the drive something you would have to turn off from the mac?
[11:36] <ahaller> AtKaaz, oh no idea. sorry
[11:37] <cafuego_> weswh-: yup
[11:37] <dfwlinuxguy> by default os x enables journaling
[11:37] <dfwlinuxguy> you have to know what you are doing to turn it offf
[11:37] <weswh-> the thing that bothers me is that i can access the data via kdesu, and play my mp3s. so why can't i pull them off. i am a super user damnit :)
[11:37] <cafuego_> weswh-: Note that when I had a shared /home on HFS+ between Linux and OSX, I needed to run fs fixing tools on it every few months. This is over a year ago, though.
[11:37] <julio> espaol
[11:38] <Arwen> weswh-, what happens when you try to copy the file?
[11:38] <cafuego_> hey cafuego
[11:38] <julianx> hello
[11:38] <feugan3333> weswh-: try moving the rw option to the options parameter, like -o rw,otheroptions
[11:38] <KenSentMe> i run ffmpeg to convert a quicktime mov file with these options: ffmpeg -i eproducties_render.mov -vcodec wmv3 -acodec wmav2 -f avi eproducties_final.avi. But i get this error: Unsupported codec for output stream #0.0. What am i doing wrong?
[11:38] <AtKaaZ> ahaller: found it, it's 'setterm' cmd line
[11:38] <weswh-> my intention is to format the disc ext3 as soon as i back this stuff up.

[11:40] <dope> how do i restart gdm
[11:40] <Arwen> dope, hit ctrl+alt+bkspace
[11:40] <dfwlinuxguy> alt-ctl-backspace
[11:40] <julianx> or in a console kill gdm
[11:40] <dope> how do i do it from the command
[11:40] <julianx> and gdm
[11:40] <Arwen> dope, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[11:40] <julianx> gdm
[11:40] <dope> thx
[11:40] <Arwen> julianx, wrong
[11:40] <ubun> my sound is all choppy in xmms, what was the fix for that again?
[11:41] <oslo> does someone here has already success to use gmailfs ??
[11:41] <julianx> Arwen i can type startx and it's ok no?
[11:41] <Arwen> julianx, you could.... but the proper way to restart gdm is with the /etc/init.d/gdm script
[11:41] <beibei> How can I hook my ZEN VISION:M to my PC?
[11:42] <julianx> Arwen ok thx i don't know
[11:42] <compengi> beibei, isn't through usb?
[11:42] <ubun> how come when i open a .mp3 file from nautilus with rhythmbox it doesnt play it, it just goes to like a 'library' of music
[11:42] <weswh-> chmod: changing permissions of `/media/firewire/Users/wes/Music/windows/The Postal Service': Read-only file system
[11:42] <beibei> it is a "creative" divide
[11:42] <weswh-> still the same, with the mount command feugan3333 reccommended
[11:42] <beibei> yes but tje PC does not recognise it
[11:43] <compengi> ubun, did you install all the libraries for .mp3?
[11:43] <ubun> yup
[11:43] <Shaba1> Ok
[11:43] <ubun> they play fine
[11:43] <Arwen> ubun, rythmbox doesn't play by default, just import
[11:43] <ubun> ah lame, guess ill use mplayer
[11:43] <Shaba1> Ok guys how does one set up a user account that has to verified over the network to an LDAP server?
[11:44] <ubun> sounds good in mplayer, xmms sounds terrible
[11:44] <Arwen> ubun, I'm a fan of VLC myself :-)
[11:44] <Arwen> xmms is legacy
[11:44] <ubun> i like vlc too
[11:44] <nofeardjb> check out songbird
[11:44] <ahaller> weswh-, i think its not possible to read hfs+ filesystems, at least with the default kernel... i would like to have that too. i found this http://www.ardistech.com/hfsplus/ , but didn't try it yet.
[11:44] <nofeardjb> its pretty different music player
[11:44] <ubun> mplayer seems to do everythin vlc does, but looks a little nicer
[11:44] <Arwen> ubun, yea - weakside of vlc is that its not extendable
[11:44] <julianx> what can i use for rippe a music cd??? on Ubuntu
[11:44] <ubun> i dont like music libraries, just playlists
[11:45] <Arwen> julianx, sound-juicer, but use a custom app if you want audiophile extraction
[11:45] <ubun> but i like being able to set my music 'equalizer' to 'rock' or 'techno' not sure if i can do that in mplayer or vlc
[11:45] <feugan3333> weswh-:  Does mount say that it's a readonly fs
[11:45] <compengi> julianx, it's a default serpentine audio cd creator
[11:45] <Lam_> can fsck check to see if a hard drive is failing?
[11:45] <weswh-> ahaller: i can read it. just can't copy the files to my system disk.
[11:45] <nder> how do I write codes like:sudo sh speed330.sh" in ubuntu?
[11:45] <nder> where*
[11:45] <Arwen> ubun, vlc has an equalizer but it doesn't have default profiles
[11:46] <weswh-> feugan3333: nope, it mounts just fine by its own estimation (no message)
[11:46] <compengi> julianx, it's found in sound and video section
[11:46] <KenSentMe> nder: go to applications, accessoires, terminal or something
[11:46] <ahaller> wesh-, sorry i meant write to hfs+ reading works.
[11:46] <Arwen> weswh-, you can't copy? what kind of error is occuring?
[11:46] <feugan3333> weswh-: What does mount say when you run it without arguments

[11:51] <weswh-> not sure if 501 is a uid, or a name, or what.

[11:57] <weswh-> CarCase928: install "nvidia-glx" (assuming it is a relatively new card, if not you need the legacy packages). go into /etc/X11/xorg.config, and change your driver line from "nv", to "nvidia"

[11:58] <agent> drkm: just about any program that checks your filesystem size will not include mounted files because they are not really files and have size 0 on the hard drive - think of them as links to files  :)

[11:58] <weswh-> feugan3333: rats. touch: cannot touch `blah': Read-only file system. this is very strange. the weirdest thing (not sure if you saw this or not) is that if i do a kdesu konqueror, i can browse through the entire drive - and even play mp3s and look at images and stuff. if i try to copy them to my home dir on this system, it says "the file doesn't exist"
[11:59] <weswh-> feugan3333: (well, through konqueror that is what it says. if i do sudo cp, it says ommiting folder)
[12:00] <ubun> how can i make it so when i right-click on a folder of mp3's in nautilus, it will play them all in amarok?
