[12:01] <Okita> Midge1: From the menu? Can you try launching it from the terminal by going "sudo synaptic" froma  prompt?
[12:01] <Midge1> no idea of the cause
[12:01] <Midge1> i tried both
[12:01] <computermc> does anyone know of a easy to use backup program?
[12:01] <Midge1> ill try from terminal
[12:01] <eneried> jrib, no, both were installed at same time :S
[12:01] <Midge1> again
[12:01] <pluma> Also, none of the ntfs partitions are reported as mounted by mount. Any help here?
[12:01] <eneried> Pelo, search for the screensaver?
[12:01] <theAdib> helllo Ubuntu forum
[12:01] <eneried> how can i do it using command line?
[12:01] <eneried> hello theAdib
[12:01] <Midge1> hmm
[12:01] <moonlite> If i need a virtual machine to run windows (never mind the reason), what are my best options?
[12:02] <Midge1> su says authentication failiur, but i just reset roots password???
[12:02] <theAdib> is there a gcc cross compiler to compile code on an i386 for an arm ?
[12:02] <jrib> eneried: k well you should still be able to configure options, you should have to screensaver links in your preferences.  dpkg -L xscreensaver | grep bin   may help you figure out the command line way
[12:02] <Midge1> so i know its right
[12:02] <computermc> moonlite: vmware works
[12:02] <moonlite> computermc: but that costs money right?
[12:02] <St3althy> whats good ftp daemon
[12:02] <computermc> moonlite: no
[12:02] <jrib> eneried: you probably want to remove gnome-screensaver too?  Not sure how that works...
[12:02] <Staz> glftpd
[12:02] <theAdib> when I  do gcc -mcpu=arm7 it fails
[12:02] <eneried> jrib, no, i'll try
[12:02] <neo_> when my computer boots and when I goto ctrl + alt F1, it only shows a strip of text about 2inc wide on the left of the screen any ideas?
[12:03] <Midge1> sudo synaptic = command not found
[12:03] <Pelo> eneried, yeah, I  just search for one and they seem to be located in  /usr/share/applications/screensavers  &  /usr/share/applnk/System/ScreenSavers, among other places
[12:03] <jrib> Midge1: are you using kubuntu?
[12:03] <Midge1> seems synaptic buggered itself
[12:03] <moonlite> computermc: ok, but vmware-player from synaptic isn't what i want right? (that's just for prebuilt images if i'm correct?)
[12:03] <Midge1> no
[12:03] <Midge1> ubuntu
[12:03] <freebse> Midget: sudo apt-get install synaptic

[12:03] <kitche> moonlite: depends vmware workstation costs money but vmware server and vmware player are free
[12:03] <computermc> moonlite: I used the vmware-server
[12:04] <Midge1> :S
[12:04] <pluma> Help: mount complains "already mounted or target busy" whenever I try to mount my ntfs partition. It is not mounted (per mount -l) and the target doesn't seem to matter. How do I mount it?
[12:04] <computermc> moonlite: got it from their website
[12:04] <St3althy> Staz: what about proftp
[12:04] <moonlite> oh ok
[12:04] <Dralid> how can I configure /boot/grub/menu.lst to boot to my WinXP drive on SATA2?
[12:04] <graft> neo_: take that friction tape off the rest of the screen..?
[12:04] <Midge1> freebse: 1st it says
[12:04] <Midge1> synaptic is already the newest version.
[12:04] <Midge1> then
[12:04] <computermc> moonlite: with the server you can make those machine images
[12:04] <Midge1> dpkg: `update-rc.d' not found on PATH.
[12:04] <Midge1> dpkg: 1 expected program(s) not found on PATH.

[12:04] <Midge1> E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)
[12:04] <Staz> St3althy : have not tried that one
[12:05] <moonlite> computermc: you make the images with vmware server and "play" them with vmware-player?
[12:05] <eneried> Pelo, i found some, what i can do then?

[12:05] <Midge1> thanks :)
[12:05] <computermc> moonlite: I guess you could, I just played them right in the server GUI
[12:05] <Midge1> (pastebin)
[12:05] <Pelo> eneried,   delete the ones you don'T want ( or move them somewhere else to test)
[12:05] <graft> the reconfigure probably won't work...
[12:06] <computermc> moonlite: everything happens in one window
[12:06] <Midge1> no errors
[12:06] <graft> Midge1: have you got /usr/sbin/update-rc.d?
[12:06] <DisHaze> How can I grow my ext3 partition? (please PM me)
[12:06] <Midge1> it just ran] 
[12:06] <eneried> ah, thanks
[12:06] <Midge1> 2 secs
[12:06] <computermc> does anyone know of a easy to use backup program?
[12:06] <neo_> what serve do i need to stop to istall my video drivers? is it my x server, if so how do i do that?
[12:06] <neo_> server*
[12:06] <eneried> but this is the "old way" method
[12:06] <moonlite> computermc: ok neat thx
[12:06] <sobersabre> computermc dd,tar,gz
[12:06] <kitche> neo_: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[12:06] <graft> neo_: /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[12:06] <Midge1> yes i do
[12:07] <graft> err, what kitche said
[12:07] <neo_> thn
[12:07] <Pelo> eneried,  then try looking up the package name in synaptic and remove them
[12:07] <neo_> thanks very much
[12:07] <eneried> there's no package for each screensaver, and i like some of them, i wish they does not go
[12:08] <sobersabre> I have a fs problem
[12:08] <computermc> sobersabre: where do I get that, and can it backup to a windows shared folder?
[12:08] <Pelo> fs &
[12:08] <sobersabre> on last reboot I was asked to run fsck manually, which I did
[12:08] <graft> Midge1: um, so can you run synaptic now?
[12:08] <Midge1> nope
[12:08] <eneried> jrib, i installed xscreensaver, and uninstalled gnome-screensaver, now i can't select screensavers :S
[12:08] <sobersabre> there were many problems that fsck found
[12:08] <Midge1> and install gives the same erro after reconfig
[12:08] <graft> Midge1: start a root shell and do echo $PATH
[12:09] <sobersabre> and then after reboot, X cannot start
[12:09] <woro2006> hi, if my broadcast address is 192.168.1.255, and my router's broadcast address is 255.255.255.255. How can I change it to match my router's?
[12:09] <Midge1> "/usr/local/qt/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"
[12:09] <toM|vendettA> hi my windows xp is broken
[12:09] <toM|vendettA> help please
[12:10] <sobersabre> toM|vendettA call Bill Gates
[12:10] <toM|vendettA> :D just kidding ;)
[12:10] <toM|vendettA> he reffered me here!
[12:10] <graft> woro2006: shouldn't your broadcast be restricted to your subnet?
[12:10] <freebse> nou, BUY VISTA m8
[12:10] <sobersabre> toM|vendettA erverybody's windows xp is broken.
[12:10] <freebse> lol
[12:10] <computermc> what do I need if I what to have 3D desktops?
[12:10] <_garry> toM|vendettA: Everybody's XP is broken...
[12:10] <Midge1> buy a 3d monitor?
[12:10] <woro2006> graft, the router is set to broadcast in 255.255.255.255
[12:11] <graft> woro2006: that's almost certainly wrong...
[12:11] <freebse> winDOS is broken by default
[12:11] <woro2006> it keeps on getting transmission errors if I set it to 192.168.1.255
[12:11] <HymnToLife> _garry, mine is not, I'm using it right now :)
[12:11] <BlueEagle> woro2006: You can (in theory) set it as 255.255.255.255, but you really, really don't want to do that.
[12:11] <Midge1> does anyone have anymore ideas?
[12:11] <sobersabre> guys i have serious problem......
[12:11] <_garry> HymnToLife: Yeah, right ;-)
[12:11] <sobersabre> with the filesystem.
[12:11] <graft> Midge1: try sudo echo $PATH
[12:11] <sobersabre> and everybody ibnores it.
[12:12] <Midge1> i did
[12:12] <Midge1> and posted the result
[12:12] <sobersabre> s/ibnores/ignores/
[12:12] <Midge1> 2 secs ill do it again
[12:12] <freebse> computermc: Vista :) no seriously the compiz stuff
[12:12] <BlueEagle> woro2006: Odds are that it probably wouldn't do what you intend it to do as your router will limit broadcasts to your subnet anyways.
[12:12] <Midge1> "/usr/local/qt/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"
[12:12] <php-freak> IS there a way to get more desktop themes?
[12:12] <graft> Midge1: err, no, wait, that ain't right
=== jesen_dodje_ja_s is now known as mobidove
[12:12] <Midge1> ok
[12:12] <sobersabre> php-freak desktop themes  for what ?
[12:12] <woro2006> but my dhcp interface is broadcasting on 255.255.255.255
[12:12] <woro2006> but the static ip is broadcasting on 192.168.1.255
[12:12] <php-freak> ubuntu
[12:13] <ks3> php-freak, http://art.gnome.org
[12:13] <php-freak> or I should say themes
[12:13] <computermc> freebse: crap vista
[12:13] <woro2006> so which one is right?
[12:13] <php-freak> I see there a difference Gnome, and etc
[12:13] <sobersabre> woro2006 - tis one of the reasons why you won't like to broadcast on 255.255.255.255
[12:13] <eneried> hey you told me about xscreensaver, it's the one shipped with breezu, thanks a lot
[12:13] <Midge1> what wasnt right btw, what you said or the output?
[12:13] <freebse> computermc: lol
[12:13] <computermc> This video show what I want. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQYk09CHOZs
[12:13] <eneried> ;) ;) thanks Pelo, thanks jrib
[12:13] <php-freak> wahts the gdm setup?
[12:14] <sobersabre> php-freak : "login screen setup"
[12:14] <Midge1> gdm = gnome display manger
[12:14] <woro2006> sobersabre, why?
[12:14] <lostsync> php-freak, you can install gnome-art package which will help you look for and install themes.  once installed (sudo apt-get install gnome-art) it can be launched as Art Manager from the prefrences menu
[12:14] <Agrajag> GDM is the login manager
[12:14] <eneried> then I found a forum talking about xscreensaver, and it should be what I want ;)
[12:14] <graft> Midge1: what i said... um, trying to figure out how sudo sets PATH
[12:14] <Midge1> ok
[12:14] <eneried> How to get a screensavermanager with more options that gnome-screensaver http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=195557
[12:15] <Midge1> btw if it helps, before this problem everyone installation/update would work, but 'fail' with an error code 2
[12:15] <php-freak> I'm just basically looking for themes that will make my icons, windows, and etc look more smaller. More of a windows xp look, but I like linux, so im going to try to achieve the display that i want
[12:15] <Midge1> and nown they actually fail with error code 2
[12:15] <Midge1> and synaptic wont launch
[12:16] <Midge1> except update, which fails silently
[12:16] <Jowi> woro2006, the broadcast address should match the dhcp setup. common sense. listen to sobersabre
[12:16] <Spee_Der> Good evening world.
[12:17] <woro2006> Jowi, what's the proper setting then?
[12:17] <php-freak> is there a way of doing that?
[12:17] <woro2006> Jowi, I keep on getting transmission errors on eth0
[12:17] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: How's it going ?
[12:18] <ks3> php-freak, you can also adjust your pixel size to make fonts, icons, etc look smaller

[12:19] <ks3> php-freak, under system -> preferences -> fonts -> details
[12:19] <ks3> php-freak, the resolution item... it tells x how many pixels per inch
[12:19] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: If you have weather applet, my box is KPVD.
[12:19] <ks3> php-freak, if you make it less, things get smaller
[12:19] <Jowi> woro2006, start with your router settings: ip 192.168.1.1, subnet 255.255.255.0, broadcast 192.168.255.255 (for example)
[12:20] <rixxon> how to i make an iso out of a mounted cd?
[12:20] <graft> hey Midge1 - what's your /etc/sudoers like?
[12:20] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: I think, maybe I'll check ;) *is curious* but man, it's really that bad :/ gotta be careful huuh
[12:20] <St3althy> do i want to install proftpd to run from inetd or standalone
[12:20] <php-freak> I see

[12:20] <Midge1> erm
[12:20] <Midge1> 2 secs
[12:21] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Yeh, may shut down for few hours because of lightning etc.....   I can't tell you how much I appreciate the help with the 2nd screen, this is the cats meow....  Cheers for now.....
[12:21] <Jowi> woro2006, you should only use 255.255.255.255 as broadcast if you have more than 1 ip address on the same interface.
[12:21] <Midge1> blank afaics
[12:21] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Good luck with the install also....
[12:21] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Hehe thanks, good luck where you are and hope everything goes good :)
[12:21] <Spee_Der> Cheers mate.
[12:22] <php-freak> Ncie now I can adjust all my fonts
[12:22] <toM|vendettA> can someone try connecting to irc.gg-center.net, and see if they can or cannot?
[12:22] <DARKGuy> Peace :)
[12:22] <woro2006> Jowi, how do I tweak the router's broadcast address?
[12:22] <Flannel> Spee_Der: that depends on what you want to do with it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ProFTPD
[12:22] <Spee_Der> Flannel: I'll look into that,....

[12:23] <jenda> There is a quiz in #ubuntu-trivia starting in a few minutes! The lucky winner will be getting a free Ubuntu Poster!!!
[12:23] <Jowi> woro2006, a router will only have one address per nic so it is never used. you can only tweak the routers broadcast if you have that option in the setup of the router (by its webinterface for example) but on most consumer routers it is automatic and not configurable.
[12:23] <jenda> </spam>
[12:23] <Spee_Der> Flannel: I think you meant that for someone else ?
[12:23] <Midge1> i dont know :P

[12:23] <Midge1> how can i tell?
[12:23] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Flannel: I think it was for St3althy :P
[12:23] <graft> Midge1: um, if your packages are up-to-date, dpkg -l | grep sudo ought to do it

[12:23] <Spee_Der> rgr
[12:24] <Jowi> woro2006, however, if your router *do* use 255.255.255.255 that doesn't mean that your network card in the computer should use the same. use 192.168.1.255 first of all to see if it works (it should)
[12:24] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: See you g'luck :)
[12:24] <Midge1> 1.6.8p12
[12:25] <woro2006> Jowi, I have two interfaces on the same box. Eth0 is set 192.168.1.3, netmask 255.255.255.0
[12:25] <woro2006> eth1 is auto dhcp

[12:26] <Jowi> woro2006, and eth1?
[12:26] <graft> Midge1: um... hrm... well, this is my best guess: sudo modifies your $PATH by adding in /usr/sbin (if that option is compiled in) - but in your case it isn't doing so...
[12:26] <graft> Midge1: try reinstalling sudo, maybe..? dunno why it would be busted...
[12:26] <woro2006> eth1 is dhcp auto
[12:26] <Midge1> i cant reinstall it cause the intsall stuff doesnt owkr/requires it
[12:26] <Jowi> woro2006, and what ip and netmask does it get?
[12:27] <graft> Midge1: you can do it - just do sudo -i, then do apt-get install, etc., and it should work fine
[12:27] <woro2006> 192.168.1.40, 255.255.255.0,
[12:27] <Midge1> it was all working until it hung one evening and upon reboot it didnt
[12:27] <woro2006> broadcast is 255.255.255.255

[12:28] <graft> Midge1: do that, you should be able to use apt-get without sudo after that, and it'll have the correct path
[12:28] <jrib> jughead: what player are you using?
[12:29] <jughead> I tried mplayer and xine
[12:29] <woro2006> Jowi, do I set the subnet mask in the router or something?
[12:29] <graft> jughead: tried another wmv?
[12:29] <vader> vlc works for me :)
[12:29] <Jowi> woro2006, you can.

[12:32] <Jowi> good luck woro2006
[12:32] <Midge1> user (root) r+w group (root) r
[12:32] <St3althy> im trying to make it so when a user on our internal network opens firefox on their machine and types 'intranet' in the address bar and it will open our ubuntu webserver
[12:32] <Midge1> im really confused
[12:33] <_garry> I was setting up NFS between my PC and laptop and noticed there's no exportfs command. I've got nfs-common and nfs-user-server installed. Is there a package I'm missing? Nothing shows up in Synaptic...
[12:33] <graft> Midge1: um... no execute permissions for anyone?!
[12:33] <computermc> does anyone know of instructions for installing and using Xgl on an ATI graphics card
[12:33] <Jowi> St3althy, /etc/hosts (man hosts)
[12:33] <Pie-rate> ubotu, tell pie-rate about ati
[12:33] <Jowi> night
[12:33] <HYB> computermc, www.ubuntuguide.org
[12:33] <Midge1> graft: doesnt seem that way
[12:33] <St3althy> Jowi: i already have hosts setup right like ip domain.com
[12:33] <St3althy> but it doesnt work
[12:34] <graft> Midge1: that is bad...
[12:34] <Skwid_> (off topic) is there a way to save your level in frozen bubble ??? :)
[12:34] <Midge1> :S
[12:34] <graft> Midge1: chmod a+x /usr/sbin/*
[12:34] <dandaman32> Skwid: you can specify which level to start with on the command line
[12:34] <graft> Midge1: assuming you can run chmod :P
[12:34] <Midge1> ill probably go and try another linux distro then, ubuntu only lasted a week before dying :P
[12:34] <Midge1> oh ok
[12:35] <Midge1> i didnt think it was fixable
[12:35] <Midge1> ill try
[12:35] <diskus> St3althy: tried, ip intranet?
[12:35] <diskus> St3althy: in hosts?
[12:35] <Midge1> i can chmod :P
=== chobits__ is now known as Elda
[12:35] <Midge1> just did, installing java
[12:35] <jughead> jrib, pastebins not loading for me...
[12:35] <graft> Midge1: not sure how this happened, but i have a hard time imagining ubuntu was responsible
[12:35] <Elda> !ubotu beryl
[12:35] <Skwid_> dandaman32: really ! can i do that in the interface too ?
[12:35] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:35] <Dan_n2200> midge1 it died , what happend
[12:35] <jrib> jughead: I think it's down, see the /topic
[12:35] <boodle> Howdy, Regarding compiz. I seem to have the bottom of my windows cut off (when maximized under gnome..hidden by bottom panel) Any idea how to fix
[12:35] <dandaman32> Skwid_: no, you have to do it on the command line
[12:36] <Skwid_> ok
[12:36] <Midge1> graft: bash: /usr/sbin/update-rc.d: cannot execute binary file is the error from update-rc.d as root
[12:36] <Midge1> so its changed
[12:36] <dandaman32> boodle: what video card are you running?
[12:36] <boodle> dandaman32, nvidia 7400
[12:36] <St3althy> diskus: i have and still nothing
[12:36] <xgl> computermc, i've got a good howto on del.icio.us/rmordor though i guess it's in portuguese
[12:36] <borg> what do i do if this message shows up, where do i get this DRI, i have fglrx driver the ubuntu version installed
[12:36] <Jowi> sorry St3althy I was going to bet. add "127.0.0.1 intranet" to /etc/hosts and that will work
[12:36] <borg> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".

[12:37] <cadu> hello, i'm having a strange problem here... i'm using a PPPoE connection, but after 10 minutes something just WIPES /etc/resolv.conf leaving just "nameserver 192.168.1.1" (which is pointless as i'm using a bridged connection) , anyone can help ? thanks in advancec

[12:37] <computermc> xgl: I only know english
[12:37] <DARKGuy> Hi! anybody know how to get the current X resolution and parameters? I have a Knoppix machine booted here and I want to know what are the X parameters it uses since it works better with my monitor than the parameters I set to it manually in my box. Anybody got an idea?
[12:37] <boodle> dandaman32, nvidia driver (their binary)
[12:37] <computermc> I think the directions at ubuntuguide.org will do
[12:37] <computermc> Thanks
[12:37] <dandaman32> DARKGuy: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:38] <mordof> hi, does anyone have a list of all the bash commands?
[12:38] <Arrick> computermc go to babelfish.com first and have it traslate the site for you
[12:38] <DARKGuy> dandaman32: It has XF86config but I can't spot it, it's just a default XF86 conf :/
[12:38] <computermc> ok
[12:38] <cadu> DARKGuy: search for the generated /etc/X11/Xorg.conf or something
[12:38] <RoKFiT> is ubuntu aimed at kde or gnome more?
[12:38] <Arrick> gnome
[12:38] <Elda> Brb hopefully, going to try rebooting to see what happens after I readjusting some settings :S
[12:38] <mordof> RoKFiT: kubuntu is kde :P
[12:38] <dandaman32> boodle: in my experience the best way to do it is Xgl, although i have managed to get AIGLX working in fedora core 6
[12:38] <toM|vendettA> can someone try connecting to irc.gg-center.net, and see if they can or cannot?
[12:38] <_garry> Has nfs-utils been dropped from Dapper? Searching on Google I see a few posts about errors returned by exportfs, and 'apt-get install nfs-utils' tells me there's no package
[12:38] <Midge1> graft: ohh a new error from apt-get now :)
[12:38] <St3althy> jowi
[12:38] <RoKFiT> thank you
[12:38] <Midge1> error 1 :)
[12:39] <DARKGuy> Er, wait, now that you mention it, I might just copy it to my box and experiment
[12:39] <St3althy> i added 127.0.0.1 intranet
[12:39] <St3althy> and nothing
[12:39] <graft> Midge1: um, are you sure your disk is in good shape?
[12:39] <boodle> dandaman32, heh k
[12:39] <Midge1> yeah
[12:39] <DARKGuy> thanks people xD
[12:39] <Midge1> i ran a full diag when it happened, the maxtor util says its fine
[12:39] <graft> 'cannot execute binary file' is not an error i'm familiar with
[12:40] <dandaman32> boodle: nvidias drivers are still in beta (afaik) and probably shouldnt be used yet
[12:40] <dandaman32> does compiz run at an acceptable speed? if not you probably have openGL set up wrong
[12:40] <Flannel> _garry: nfs-utils wasn't in breezy either, you sure that's the package name?
[12:40] <boodle> dandaman32, right..
[12:40] <Midge1> :S
[12:40] <dandaman32> boodle: do the visuals from compiz look smooth?
[12:41] <graft> boodle, dandaman32: I think AIGLX is more stable than Xgl, so i'd suggest going that route
[12:41] <cadu> also, why gstreamer0.10 lacks mp3 support ? :(
[12:41] <Midge1> graft: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35053/
[12:41] <Flannel> !mp3 | cadu

[12:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hosts - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:41] <St3althy> !host

[12:41] <sobersabre> need help.
[12:41] <_garry> Flannel: exportfs is in nfs-utils in Suse 10.0 so I assumed maybe it was in the same package on Ubuntu
[12:41] <boodle> graft, any ideas on why my windows are cutoff when maximized (like it's miscalcing the max window size + bottom gnome panel)
[12:41] <borg> where do i get the missing extension Xfree86-DRI ?
[12:41] <dandaman32> boodle: if the visuals are smooth and everything else works its probably a bug with compiz, try beryl www.beryl-project.org
[12:41] <sobersabre> I have several files that got wiped out.
[12:42] <graft> Midge1: can you cat /usr/sbin/udpate-rc.d?
[12:42] <St3althy> do i need to add to our router to query the ubuntu server if i want all intranet sites to work
[12:42] <graft> boodle: nope, does that to me, too
[12:42] <boodle> dandaman32, prolly so. using 0.3.3
[12:42] <boodle> graft, heh k. will try beryl
[12:42] <graft> boodle: for some apps... not all of em
[12:42] <graft> boodle: oh.. i'm using beryl
[12:42] <Midge1> cat: /usr/sbin/udpate-rc.d: No such file or directory
[12:42] <arathald> I'm having trouble with installing ATI Drivers (for the V5200) -- No matter what I try it insists on using Mesa
[12:42] <boodle> graft, screen/aterm, firefox etc. getting it for most of my stuff
[12:43] <Midge1> but its there!
[12:43] <aleka> How can I set Nautlis to show thumbnails instead of details?
[12:43] <Flannel> _garry: nope.  Never a package like that.  exportfs is in nfs-kernel-server, so that's the package you want (packages.ubuntu.com has a package search for files, the second search thing)
[12:43] <graft> Midge1: um, what?
[12:43] <boodle> i almost think it's gtk-window-decorator not getting it's window borders added to the v-height
[12:43] <graft> Midge1: it sounds like you have a corrupt filesystem...
[12:43] <Midge1> graft: cat: /usr/sbin/udpate-rc.d: No such file or directory
[12:43] <Midge1> dammit
[12:43] <Midge1> any way of fixing it?
[12:43] <graft> fsck?
[12:43] <dandaman32> boodle, graft: probably a bug with nvidia's drivers then; im not sure how to configure aiglx with nvidia, but i know that driver version 8765 works perfectly work Xgl
[12:43] <aleka> How can I set Nautlis to show thumbnails instead of details for example on picture files? any ideas...
[12:44] <boodle> dandaman32, cool ty
[12:44] <Midge1> graft: nope :(
[12:44] <dandaman32> boodle: *with Xgl
[12:44] <graft> dandaman32: it's almost certainly a compiz bug - the nvidia driver won't have a clue about what the window size should be
[12:44] <Midge1> graft: should i reinstall?
[12:44] <xgl> http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Xgl-Compiz-Dapper
[12:44] <St3althy> can someone help me with setting up hosts so all my computers on my network can open internet and type intranet.home to get the ubuntu server homepage
[12:44] <blameless> you'll need the 9000 series drivers to use aiglx with nvidia drivers
[12:44] <boodle> dandaman32, gotcha
[12:44] <jrib> aleka: are you displaying as a list instead of icons (option in the top right above where the files show up)
[12:45] <_garry> Flannel: I guessed that might be the case. I installed nfs-user-server as that was the only one in the list. Just did an 'apt-get update' only to find nfs-kernel-server is available. Typical Ubuntu newbie, still learning the apt system... :-)
[12:45] <graft> Midge1: nope, fsck? what do you mean?
[12:45] <St3althy> no one?
[12:45] <Midge1> that running fsck doesnt fix it
[12:45] <boodle> xgl ty
[12:45] <aleka> jrib, actually it shows thmbs in the folder, but when attaching files from FF, all I see is file names.. Was wondering if I could change that to show thumbnails as well
[12:45] <Flannel> _garry: -kernel-server is in main, -user-server is in universe, it's odd if the latter was th eonly one who showed up
[12:46] <graft> St3althy: you need to run a nameserver
[12:46] <St3althy> graft: go on?
[12:46] <jrib> aleka: ah that, no.  There is probably a bug about it.... (annoys me too)
[12:46] <St3althy> i just setup ubuntu as internal server
[12:46] <aleka> beh... thnx anyways,,,,
[12:46] <borg> where do i get the missing extension Xfree86-DRI ?
[12:46] <graft> St3althy: install bind, play around with configuring it, get all your machines to use that for DNS
[12:46] <St3althy> and now i want to get the website coming up internally
[12:46] <mordof> what does Mapped memory mean? i did cat /proc/meminfo, heh
[12:47] <St3althy> graft: is there another way?
[12:47] <graft> St3althy: yeah, /etc/hosts
[12:47] <Midge1> graft: that running fsck doesnt fix it
[12:47] <graft> St3althy: on each of those machines
[12:47] <_garry> Flannel: Not odd, just me not remembering to do apt-get update. What's nice is that installing the kerne-space server automatically uninstalled the user-space server, then asked if I wanted to keep my /etc/exports, AND restarted nfs and portmapper. Nice...
[12:47] <St3althy> mmm
[12:47] <graft> Midge1: erm... yeah, save what data you can and reinstall
[12:47] <Midge1> ok
[12:47] <Midge1> thanks for your help
[12:47] <mordof> what does this mean...
[12:47] <cappiz> how can i change the GNOME LANG environment?
[12:48] <mordof> Mapped:         463676 kB
[12:48] <St3althy> graft: could i add the ubuntu server to my router dns
[12:48] <St3althy> ?

[12:49] <St3althy> i am just trying to get it to work, or at least the server name
[12:49] <St3althy> i just want internal computers to access the ubuntu other than ip address
[12:49] <sobersabre> hi.
[12:50] <sobersabre> I want to upgrade to edgy my dapper.
[12:50] <Flannel> sobersabre: yeah, you'll need to run a local nameserver, or... update all their HOSTS files
[12:50] <borg> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".  i get this error when i do fglrxinfo
[12:50] <sobersabre> Flannel wtf are you talking about ?:)
[12:50] <graft> St3althy: um, your options are: write host aliases on each one of those machines by hand, or run bind on your ubuntu machine and use it for DNS
[12:50] <graft> St3althy: in my experience the latter is somewhat, but not extremely, tricky
[12:50] <Flannel> sobersabre: blaah.  I can't nick complete today.  St3althy, that's for you.
[12:51] <Elda> bah for some reason now I cant resize my windows -_-
[12:51] <sobersabre> :)
[12:51] <nrdb> using openvpn is it possible to get the client to not use the default 1194 port ?  the clients ip address is dynamic.
[12:51] <Elda> brb >.<
[12:51] <sobersabre> nrdb what does IP address have to do with port ?
[12:51] <bitflip> borg: what driver are you using for X?
[12:51] <Flannel> St3althy: modifying everyones HOST file might be easiest, actually.  If you have a static IP, for the ubuntu box, and a relatively constant number of machines (or rather, new machines not connecting all the time)
[12:51] <borg> bitflip, fglrx the one that's in the ubuntu repositories
[12:52] <sobersabre> Flannel relatively constant is a nice expression of speach :)
[12:52] <nrdb> sobersabre: the comment in the config file for 'listen' indicates that you need to specify an ip address.

[12:52] <St3althy> Flannel: well i did this http://servername and it worked
[12:52] <St3althy> so howcome i cant set alias?
[12:53] <sobersabre> St3althy you should be able to.
[12:53] <graft> St3althy: you did that from where?
[12:53] <St3althy> a pc on the network
[12:53] <sobersabre> guys, I am replacing dapper to edgy in sources.list.
[12:53] <graft> St3althy: um, so looks like your router does do some local DNS
[12:53] <sobersabre> Will this be enough for edgy upgrade ?
[12:53] <St3althy> graft yeh it must
[12:54] <St3althy> so if i add another alias, what do i need to restart
[12:54] <graft> St3althy: what's the router?
[12:54] <St3althy> dlink or linksys
[12:54] <St3althy> cheap one
[12:54] <graft> St3althy: model #?
[12:54] <St3althy> no idea
[12:54] <St3althy> sorry
[12:54] <sobersabre> graft maybe he has a linux based router, and he can configure the named on it via ssh......
[12:54] <St3althy> do i need to restart service on server
[12:54] <St3althy> no i havent touched the router
[12:54] <sobersabre> St3althy how about looking at the router ?
[12:55] <St3althy> sobersabre: sorry man its too far away
[12:55] <sobersabre> glasses?
[12:55] <graft> St3althy: yeah, you really jus twant to fiddle with the router here... but, sounds like it's already doing what you want?
[12:55] <sobersabre> binoculars ?
[12:55] <St3althy> is there a service i need to reboot once added alias to /etc/hosts
[12:55] <sobersabre> St3althy: NO.
[12:55] <St3althy> mmmmmmm
[12:56] <St3althy> well i just added alias and it didnt work
[12:56] <bitflip> borg: fglrxinfo | grep vendor ...Does this say ATI or Mesa?
[12:56] <sobersabre>  /etc/hosts works per call.
[12:56] <sobersabre> St3althy what does your nsswitch.conf do ?
[12:56] <borg> bitflip, OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: www.mesa3d.org it says that
[12:56] <sobersabre> St3althy there's name service switch in /etc/nsswitch.conf
[12:57] <sobersabre> It has a line beginning with hosts:
[12:57] <St3althy> ok
[12:57] <jughead> how do I add a shortcut to my home folder on my desktop?
[12:57] <Eroick> if Im developing in python on Ubuntu, am I better off with pyGTK or wxPython?
[12:57] <bitflip> borg: I may be mistaken but I don't think the stock ubuntu repository for fglrx support 3d acceleration - you'll have to use the ones from ati's site
[12:57] <sobersabre> St3althy after the colon there is what ?
[12:58] <St3althy> files dns
[12:58] <sobersabre> ( the switch defines resolving order )
[12:58] <graft> ati support for 3d acceleration is cracked
[12:58] <sobersabre> St3althy  'files' means /etc/hosts
[12:58] <Elda> Ubutu beryl
[12:58] <_garry> jughead: drag your home folder from the file manager onto the desktop
[12:58] <Elda> !ubotu beryl
[12:58] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:58] <sobersabre> St3althy are you sure you have 1 line that leads to the name you're trying to access ?
[12:59] <graft> specifically, ati doesn't support AIGLX
[12:59] <litwel> do you know where to find dev info on graphical boot menus?
[12:59] <St3althy> sobersabre yehs
[12:59] <borg> bitflip, ok
[12:59] <sobersabre> St3althy then, you have typo.
[12:59] <bitflip> borg: what version of ubuntu (edgy I assume?) and what ati card
[12:59] <St3althy> what?
[12:59] <St3althy> where
[01:00] <borg> yes edgy and radeon 9800
[01:00] <sobersabre> St3althy either in the hosts file or in the address you've typed.
[01:00] <jughead> _garry, it says the destination folder is inside the source folder
[01:00] <grndslm> ati doesn't support aiglx??
[01:00] <St3althy> in what file sobersabre
[01:00] <sobersabre> guys. how do I upgrade from dapper to edgy without X
[01:00] <sobersabre> ?
[01:00] <sobersabre> St3althy: /etc/hosts
[01:00] <bitflip> borg: http://tinyurl.com/yc6mal <- follow the steps in sequence and it should work - get back with me if you have trouble during this
[01:01] <_garry> jughead: Oh, right... hang on...
[01:01] <St3althy> i have 127.0.0.1 localhost servername newnameijusttyped
[01:01] <St3althy> newnameijusttyped does not work
[01:01] <borg> bitflip, ok thx
[01:01] <jughead> _garry, nm I think it will be ok; i put a shortcut on the top bar
[01:01] <sobersabre> St3althy 'doesn't work' with which application ?
[01:01] <xplic1t> what can i install to enable the 'yacc' command?
[01:02] <_garry> jughead: I can do it with Konqueror by dragging to the desktop and doing "Link here". You need to find how to do the same with whatever file manager you're using
[01:02] <_garry> jughead: Just don't do "Copy here" or "Move here"
[01:02] <sobersabre> St3althy if you type: "ping newnameijusttyped"
[01:02] <sobersabre> does it work ?
[01:03] <Elda> Im curious, in reinstalling this will I have to edit my grub menu? :s
[01:03] <Arigato> what is the best PHP IDE available from the repositories?
[01:03] <Elda> As Ive officially borked my install trying to install beryl
[01:03] <aleka> is it possible to have an option to "send to CD Drive" while right clicking on a file/folder as it's done on a windows shell?
[01:03] <sobersabre> Arigato this is a tricky question.
[01:03] <Elda> Tried to change too much >.<
[01:03] <sobersabre> Arigato there are several.
[01:04] <Arigato> could you name a few?
[01:04] <lorenzo> xplic1t: I think bison is what you want.
[01:04] <Flannel> xplic1t: either freebsd5-buildutils or cook
[01:04] <sobersabre> aleka install nautilus actions extension, and define such thing if it makes you feel good.
[01:04] <noiesmo> Elda, if you do a reinstall of ubuntu it will redo your mbr and grub should detect another os yu have
[01:04] <Elda> Okeydoo
[01:04] <Elda> Thanks, and brb >.<
[01:04] <Elda> well brb in about an hour
[01:04] <nikin> i have 2 problems with my Intel chipset based notebbok, first i cant get the openGL runing right with my 95* videocard, and the other is that my soundcard returns the MASTER to RECORD so it generates echo when i try to use skype
[01:04] <xplic1t> i specifically need the 'yacc' command, because running make after configuring some software fails on that command.
[01:04] <sobersabre> aleka does windows have "open terminal" on right click ? :)
[01:05] <Flannel> xplic1t: however, bison is a yacc clone.
[01:05] <xplic1t> bison, freebsd5-buildutils or cook will all do that?
[01:05] <sobersabre> xplic1t you can use bison for that
[01:05] <xplic1t> ok, i'll try it
[01:05] <sobersabre> bison can behave like yacc.
[01:05] <nikin> !yacc > nikin
[01:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about yacc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:06] <sobersabre> xplic1t if you have problems, just consult the man page on how to be 100% yacc compatible
[01:06] <jughead> thank you _garry
[01:06] <Flannel> xplic1t: but, like I said.  freebsd5-buildutils or cook, both provide yacc
[01:06] <trilliji> Recently I installed the kde package on my ubuntu install. Recently after I lost the ability to automount my usb 512M memory drive, annyone have any clue as to what might be wrong?
[01:06] <sobersabre> aleka have you got my response ?
[01:06] <aleka> sobersabre, don't get me wrong I am not whining abt things I have in windows and what I don get in LInux.. I was just asking a Q
[01:06] <bruenig> trilliji, are you sure it doesn't mount, or does it just not such up on the desktop?
[01:07] <bruenig> s/such/show
[01:07] <sobersabre> aleka Its ok, I was joking: as if that irritated me....
[01:07] <sobersabre> :)
[01:07] <sobersabre> something else irritates me, believe me.
[01:07] <_garry> jughead: 's OK. Glad to help :-)
[01:07] <trilliji> bruenig: I stand corrected, it does not bring it up on the desktop so I can browse with  nautilus
[01:08] <trilliji> I don't know if it is mounted
[01:08] <bruenig> !icons
[01:08] <ubotu> Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[01:08] <bruenig> trilliji, I would assume it would be a fix similar to what ubotu just said
[01:08] <lorenzo> Anyone know how to get balsa to work correctly with gpg?  It gives me an error saying it can't find my key whenever I try to sign a message.  I only have 1 key in the standard place, so it should have no trouble finding it.
[01:08] <bruenig> trilliji, to see if it is mounting, put it in and go to /media
[01:08] <Skwid_> what's the best way to get a no-ip type service on ubuntu ?
[01:09] <sobersabre> lorenzo who's key are you encrypting with ?
[01:09] <sko0zy> can anyone suggest a good python eviorment for a noob
[01:09] <hossi> how do I make my proxy settings in XChat-GNOME 0.13 ?
[01:09] <nikin> trilliji: if its mounted then a folder will show up in /media
[01:09] <trilliji> The light comes on when i insert it, but after a short time it goes off
[01:09] <sobersabre> sko0zy: a text editor will do.
[01:09] <Pie-rate> Is there any way to watch dvds with deinterlacing?
[01:09] <sobersabre> Pie-rate yes. there is.
[01:09] <sko0zy> sobersabre, ya i know but like a good one to learn in...i always learn better with a GUI then with just pure text
[01:10] <Pie-rate> i have libdvdread installed, it works great
[01:10] <Pie-rate> just no deinterlacing
[01:10] <nikin> Pie-rate: see VLC-s settings
[01:10] <bruenig> trilliji, check in /media after you put it in
[01:10] <nothing> I'm trying to do a   mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1      however I'm getting a /dev/md1  No such file or directory error.  Any idea why this might be?  md0 worked fine...
[01:10] <sobersabre> Pie-rate try any of the big IDEs - kdevelop
[01:10] <sobersabre> or anjuta
[01:11] <trilliji> trying, I have a sda2 and sda3 in media ( in addition to cdroms )
[01:11] <timthelion> I finally got windows to connect to my ubuntu machine but when I goto connect the printer, windows comes up with the print spooler and the title access denied unable to connect.
[01:11] <sobersabre> there's python IDE ( I don't remember its name - google for it )
[01:11] <timthelion> sobersabre: idle
[01:11] <kurisutofuaa> Having install problems with Dipper-amd64 and I have try'ed Edgy-amd64 install also but I keep getting Xserver crash when I try to load the cd's it gives me an error: No screens found.
[01:11] <timthelion> sobersabre: in add/remove on the applications menu
[01:11] <nikin> trilliji: see if one of them is the usbkey
[01:11] <Pie-rate> sobersabre: i am not asking about a python IDE.
[01:11] <noiesmo> timthelion, did you share the printer thru samba
[01:11] <timthelion> noiesmo: yes, I think so
[01:11] <trilliji> nikin: How do I do that?
[01:12] <timthelion> noiesmo: how would you do it ?
[01:12] <nikin> enter the folder
[01:12] <sobersabre> kurisutofuaa maybe you don't need X during the installation.
[01:12] <nikin> or is the usbkey empty?
[01:12] <timthelion> noiesmo: I have an entry in smb.conf for it
[01:12] <trilliji> both folders are empty
[01:12] <ProN00b> does anyone know how to get tilp to work ?
[01:12] <lorenzo> Skwid_: I use ddclient with an account at dyndns.com.
[01:12] <nikin> Pie-rate: VLC has a deinterlacing vidofilter
[01:13] <Skwid_> lorenzo: thank you
[01:13] <noiesmo> in smb.conf find the security line and change it to share instead of user that way no authentication will be required
[01:13] <kurisutofuaa> sobersabre: So what do I do?
[01:13] <Pie-rate> I found it, thank you nikin.
[01:13] <noiesmo> timthelion, in smb.conf find the security line and change it to share instead of user that way no authentication will be required
[01:13] <nikin> Pie-rate: nm
[01:13] <sobersabre> kurisutofuaa are you on a fast internet link ?
[01:13] <noiesmo> timthelion, you will need to restart samba to have permissions take affect
[01:13] <kurisutofuaa> sobersabre: yeah
[01:13] <Pie-rate> what is the best deinterlacing method?
[01:13] <sobersabre> kurisutofuaa which graphic card do you use ?
[01:14] <sobersabre> ( do you have )
[01:14] <kurisutofuaa> sobersabre: Ati Radeon X800 XL
[01:16] <timthelion> noiesmo: that is already there, I am going to try setting public and writable to yes
[01:16] <trilliji> nikin: both folders are emis on when it can be accessedpty and the light on the devive has gone off, normally it
[01:16] <flasher222> i have a canon bjc-4400 printer. can anyone help me set it up with my xubuntu?
[01:16] <noiesmo> timthelion, k
[01:16] <nikin> trilliji: i understand... so now u use gnome again? no KDE?
[01:17] <kdc1956> anyone haveing troubl with adjust date & time
[01:17] <trilliji>  yes, I only installed kde to change the kde theme for kde applications ( amarok ) but I don't want to reinstall for this last problem I have
[01:17] <lorenzo> sobersabre: I'm just trying to sign with my own key.
[01:18] <trilliji> nikin:^
[01:18] <nikin> Pie-rate: try blend
[01:19] <trilliji> nikin: I didn't expect that KDE would break gnome
[01:19] <Pie-rate> nikin: I'll try all of them, but my research shows that bob would be the best to start with

[01:20] <St3althy> !lamp
[01:20] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[01:20] <sobersabre> kurisutofuaa I think you better do as follows: check if your card's restricted drivers are in the edgy-amd64
[01:20] <sobersabre> ( I think so )
[01:21] <hossi> how do I make my proxy settings in XChat-GNOME 0.13 ?
[01:21] <sobersabre> then you download the 'alternate install' CD
[01:21] <sobersabre> kurisutofuaa ok ?
[01:21] <nikin> Pie-rate: i red that blend is best, but try them
[01:22] <nikin> trilliji: i use them both and it didnt to by me
[01:22] <kurisutofuaa> sobersabre: I will take a look at it now one sec
[01:23] <trilliji> Well, it may not have been due to that, that is just what I perceived to be the timing

[01:24] <_garry> flasher222: I set up my HP Deskjet yesterday
[01:25] <flasher222> _garry: how did you do so?
[01:25] <jvai> flasher222 yes, i network the hp 4200tn @ work, & a epson 7xx  locally @ home
[01:25] <jvai> i'm on dapper tho
[01:25] <_garry> flasher222: I used the Printer Manager in Konqueror
[01:26] <_garry> flasher222: If you're running Gnome, I can't help
[01:26] <DevC> I thought ubuntu didn't support C# programming?
[01:26] <flasher222> _garry: am running xubuntu
[01:26] <trilliji> Are the nvidia 6150 drivers in the main repository yet?
[01:26] <jvai> sorry flasher222 i run gnome
[01:26] <_garry> flasher222: You could try using the CUPS web interface. Type "https://localhost:631" into your browser
[01:27] <flasher222> _garry: do i need to plug in my printer first?
[01:27] <DevC> I remember having to do that for printer setup lol
[01:27] <jvai> if it's a network printer, wher it says "host" put in the printer's ip addy, that works for me @ work
[01:28] <thomas_> hey guys, i've broken my permissions in my home folder. what is the chmod number to restore them to their default state (ie. so that not everything thinks it's an executable like it does now!)
[01:28] <DevC> why does gedit have C# syntax highlighting if ubuntu doesn't support c# programming o_O?
[01:28] <_garry> flasher222: If you're using the web interface to CUPS, you shouldn't need to. You just specify where it's plugged in. Or you specify where it is on the network if it's a network printer
[01:28] <jrib> DevC: http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page
[01:28] <DevC> jrib: I heard that wasn't sure fire way of using it yet though
[01:29] <_garry> thomas_: Use the 'find' command to change perms on the directories and files separately. Do 'man find' and ask again if you're not sure
[01:29] <flasher222> _garry: it's not a network printer
[01:29] <jrib> DevC: there are applications in ubuntu written in c#
[01:29] <wasp_ems> hello i am trying to install flash player on konqueror..but when i try ./flashplayer-istaller it only tries to install it on firefox..any help?
[01:29] <jvai> oo flasher222, it should be much easier then
[01:30] <jvai> just load the printer drivers from the kernel
[01:30] <_garry> flasher222: OK, so you just tell it what make and model and where it's plugged in. Oh, and you have to give it a name. If you're a hardened U**X geek, you'd call it 'lp', but you can call it pretty much what you want
=== Deep_ is now known as Magic_Boat
[01:30] <DevC> jrib: who are some of the developers on ubuntu was curious what languages they used to make ubuntu ASM with parts of c/c++/c# or what lol
[01:30] <jvai> flasher222 yu're on gnome right?
[01:30] <flasher222> ok. guys. hold on. I'm a big newbie
[01:30] <DevC> I'll go to that site and give it a look though
[01:30] <flasher222> jvai: i'm on xubuntu
[01:30] <jvai> ooooo
[01:30] <_garry> thomas_: Something like (off the top of my head): find -type d -print | xargs chmod 744 for directories
[01:31] <thomas_> _garry: why can't i just use the -R switch on chmod?
[01:31] <graft> thomas_: because you want to leave directories executable
[01:31] <_garry> thomas_: Because you need at least one X perm on directories, but no X perms on your files
[01:31] <thomas_> _garry: ok i'll give that a go
[01:31] <nikin> bytheway what does ubuntu use for automounting? i was looking for hotplug but didnt found it, so it must be something else :P
[01:31] <thomas_> _garry: and the folders should be 755?
[01:31] <Taime1> is divx part of the win32 codecs?
[01:32] <_garry> thomas_: the one for files would be something like: find -type f -print | xargs chmod 644
[01:32] <DevC> jlib: is it stable on ubuntu or will I have the bad luck of finding it mess up my installation?
[01:32] <thomas_> _garry: was that for files or folders?
[01:32] <_garry> thomas_: NO, the one I gave you with -type d is for directories
[01:32] <stormy|> What would the command be to check and see if a certain package is found?
[01:32] <_garry> thomas_: and -type f is for files
[01:32] <stormy|> installed*
[01:32] <thomas_> _garry: ok cheers
[01:32] <jrib> stormy|: apt-cache policy package
[01:32] <_garry> stormy|: "Found" where?
[01:33] <sko0zy> can someone recomend a good GUI python eviorment for a noob??
[01:33] <stormy|> lol i said the wrong word, should have been installed
[01:33] <Taime1> is divx part of the win32 codecs?
[01:33] <flasher222> my printer has a pararllel port, not usb cable
[01:33] <_garry> stormy|: Synaptic is the simplest way, IMO. Just hit the Search button
[01:33] <bitflip> nikin: I believe gnome-volume-manager
[01:33] <jvai> sko0zy triy screem from the repos, it's an html editor
[01:33] <_garry> flasher222: hold on, mine's the same. I'll just go and check...
[01:34] <_garry> flasher222: mine's plugged in the parallel port and it's /dev/parport0
[01:35] <jrib> sko0zy: just use your favorite text editor
[01:35] <nikin> bitflip :D
[01:36] <php-freak> Any one know how to install lamp?
[01:36] <jrib> !lamp | php-freak

[01:36] <php-freak> jrib: well I know that, but trying to figure out how I install it
[01:37] <jrib> sko0zy: I like vim, but for a novice, you may not like it.  It's very powerful, but has a bit of a learning curve.  Gedit should do fine
[01:37] <jrib> php-freak: that page tells you how to install it
[01:37] <ski-worklap-b342> has anyone had success with a xfs / on edgy?
[01:37] <php-freak> jrib: I read it, and it did not say.
[01:37] <php-freak> I didn't understand it to the fullest
[01:37] <blameless> Sonic|Laptop: i believe the assembly module for aes in amd64 has a different name
[01:37] <nikin> trilliji: are you here?
[01:37] <ski-worklap-b342> i experienced multiple freezes, eventually had to xfs_recover -L, dump to a spare partition, and then restore to an ext3 / partition
[01:38] <blameless> ski-worklap-b342: yes.  i use xfs on / on two machines
[01:38] <php-freak> apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-serve its saying I need to install the following packages, and i tried going to the terminal, but Don't know exactly where I go

[01:39] <ryanakca> when compiling a kernel for a desktop with beryl and lots of high memory apps, what do you recommend, Preemptible kernel or Voluntary Kernel Preemption?
[01:39] <php-freak> sorry im a linux n00b
[01:39] <jrib> php-freak: click on the link it has about installing software: "any method" https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware
[01:39] <delight> !hula
[01:39] <php-freak> I read that, but let me read it again
[01:39] <ubotu> hula: integrated mail & calendar system with simple interface. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.1.0+svn379-2.1 (edgy), package size 3081 kB, installed size 8452 kB
[01:39] <Taime1> sweet... is it as simple as installing in freespire? all i had to do was download it, extract it to /usr/lib/win....
[01:39] <ski-worklap-b342> blameless, edgy or dapper?
[01:39] <jrib> php-freak: basically in the terminal you do:  sudo apt-get install name_of_package
[01:39] <php-freak> jrib: 1 question, what is dapper drake
[01:39] <blameless> ski-worklap-b342: both are edgy
[01:39] <php-freak> okay and sudo means super user
[01:39] <ski-worklap-b342> huh
[01:39] <php-freak> an kind of confused with apt-get
[01:39] <Medical-Wei> Anyone here?
[01:39] <ski-worklap-b342> maybe xfs wasn't the problem then
[01:39] <blameless> one is amd64; one is x86
[01:40] <ski-worklap-b342> but it sure seems to have been
[01:40] <jrib> php-freak: it is a version of ubuntu, edgy is the most recent, dapper was the one before it
[01:40] <blameless> both also have ext2 /boot partitions
[01:40] <SoulOrb> mnepton:  I guess it is aes in edgy not aes_i586
[01:40] <ski-worklap-b342> blameless, thats the setup i was shooting for
[01:40] <Medical-Wei> Jiraiya: but it has long-term support
[01:40] <Medical-Wei> (uhhhh)
[01:40] <ski-worklap-b342> everything was fine for a few hors and then it froze up. subsequent reboots froze when the bootup meter was about 40% of the way across
[01:40] <blameless> SoulOrb: there isn't aes_i586 on amd64.  its like aes_x64 or something i believe
[01:40] <hikenboot> hello all anyone know where I would put dhcp3-server deamon and bind9 deamon so they start on startup ?
[01:41] <blameless> ski-worklap-b342: overheating?

[01:42] <php-freak> jrib: like the sudo apt-get install you just showed me
[01:42] <php-freak> cause im sure there is 100's of unix/linux commands
[01:42] <Medical-Wei> Where could I change the console font
[01:42] <SoulOrb> Anyone know what I might be missing here on my initrd build? cp: cannot stat `/etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz': No such file or directory
[01:42] <_garry> hikenboot: The usual place to put startup stuff is in /etc/init.d with S and K symlinks in /etc/rcX.d where X is 1 to 5

[01:43] <jrib> php-freak: nope, a student

[01:44] <php-freak> I write php for a living, and self employed 22, but I figured i
[01:44] <php-freak> i'd switch to ubuntu
[01:44] <php-freak> seems pretty simple, just need to learn the commands, and etc
[01:44] <SoulOrb> zylche: Something useful might help.  A google brings up nothing.

[01:45] <jrib> DevC: it is available through the repositories.  Don't install from the site
[01:45] <php-freak> does lamp contain phpmyadmin?
[01:45] <nikin> DevC are you using DevC on ubuntu?
[01:45] <DevC> jrib: oh ok what is the pacakage name if you happen to know it so I know what I'm looking for lol

[01:46] <DevC> jrib: ok thanks I'll go to the site and make sure I read it and any extra notes it has
[01:47] <jrib> DevC: the most helpful information on there is probably the guides linked at the bottom
[01:47] <Thaimaishu> Guys, I'm getting a black screen on 6.10
[01:47] <Thaimaishu> aftrer the load screen on the install, is this normal?
[01:47] <Thaimaishu> Someone please help me
[01:48] <DevC> jrib: ok thanks :)
[01:48] <HymnToLife> Thaimaishu, you mean _really_ black or with some text ?
[01:48] <Thaimaishu> REALLY black
[01:49] <Thaimaishu> At first there is the blinking curso
[01:49] <Thaimaishu> r
[01:49] <Thaimaishu> and then after that, it just goes black almost like a screensaver after like 20 mins of nothing.
[01:49] <Thaimaishu> Doesn't even give me a GUI menu for setup. I haven't reached even that far yet.
[01:50] <Thaimaishu> plus, i got a reply to my forums thread, they asked for more info, and i was gonna give, but forums broke on me.  I'm positive i used the right info and everything, just wont let me log in.
[01:50] <Thaimaishu> So, would you happen to know what is wrong with my stuff?
[01:51] <_garry> Thaimaishu: Is this happening while trying to install, or after you've installed?
[01:51] <Thaimaishu> While trying to install
[01:51] <Thaimaishu> I am not even able to get to the install menu yet.  After the loading screen it just stops.
[01:51] <SoulOrb> Where can I get more info on the UUID=d6bd6e8d in fstab?
[01:51] <jrib> !uuid | SoulOrb
[01:51] <ubotu> SoulOrb: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[01:51] <lexi_> just upgraded initramfs-tools against edgy-proposed. kernel does not want to boot any longer after that.  complains modprobe can?t open shared object file  libc.so.6. anyone with that problem ?
[01:51] <Thaimaishu> I'll try again.  I'll tell you what happens thanks all.
[01:51] <_garry> Thaimaishu: So you don't get to choose safe mode?
[01:51] <Thaimaishu> Nope
[01:52] <Thaimaishu> Well, no
[01:52] <SoulOrb> jrib: Thanks
[01:52] <_garry> Bad CD/DVD burn, maybe?
[01:52] <blameless> !uuid | blameless
[01:52] <ubotu> blameless: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[01:52] <Thaimaishu> I can choose options, it just won't load enough to get to the "real" install menu
[01:52] <php-freak> maybe I should stay away from phpmyadmin, and just use mysql command line interface :)
[01:53] <Thaimaishu> I just reburned Garry, thanks for your help.  I'll try again, and get back to you all on the results.
[01:53] <Thaimaishu> Be back in 30 mins if all goes well.
[01:54] <ivx> hey if i have folders in side folders in side folders that all need to have there permissions  changed, how can i change all the sub folders at the same time
[01:54] <SebHal> Hello everybody. I have some weird problems after installing Nvidia-drivers. When i logout from X to login as another user I get thrown into tty1. Anyone know what the problem can be?
[01:54] <noiesmo> ivx, man chmod
[01:54] <green_earz> ivx: chmod -R  dir
[01:54] <noiesmo> chmod -R /path/to/folder
[01:55] <_garry> ivx: You need to use 'chmod' with the 'find' command so that it only changes the directories, not the files
[01:55] <ryanakca> what version of glibc does edgy have? 2.3.11 ?
[01:55] <Virogenesis> hey people, I need to insert a script that will startup a synergy daemon every time my xwindows boots up, basically the linux just has to type synergyc --daemon -n server 192.168.123.33  on Xboot, how do I do that?
[01:55] <ivx> well i have to change all the files also
[01:55] <_garry> ivx: Something like: find /top_folder -type d | xargs chmod 744
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[01:56] <_garry> ivx: But you don't want the files having the same perms as the directories, do you?
[01:56] <ivx> _garry yes
[01:56] <ivx> _garry so what will the 744 make it
[01:56] <_garry> ivx: OK, then chmod -R 544 (or whatever) will do the job
[01:56] <JJRR123Jamesrose>  Anybody know how to set up httpd.conf so when you type http://intranet/ it loads a dir?
[01:57] <Magic_Boat> can somebody tell me how to turn off the vim's auto-backup-files feature
[01:57] <ivx> _garry what would the number be for every to read/write/excute
[01:57] <_garry> ivx: 744 is rwxr--r--, which is read perms for everyone, write for owner, execute (or enter directory) for owner
[01:57] <_garry> 777 is rwx for everyone
[01:57] <jrib> Magic_Boat: :he backup
[01:58] <_garry> ivx: but that's very bad, security-wise
[01:58] <Magic_Boat> jrib: thx
[01:58] <ivx> so sudo find /dir/ -type d | xargs 777 will do it
[01:58] <ivx> _garry it is my www folder, they all have root only so ftp isn't working
[01:58] <_garry> ivx: No, you left off the chmod command
[01:58] <SebHal> anyone know how i dont get to login screen after i logout? I end up in a plain terminal
[01:59] <_garry> It would be something like: sudo find /dir -type d | xargs chmod 777
[01:59] <ivx> _garry so just throw chmod at the end
[01:59] <oOKenTOo> hi..
[01:59] <oOKenTOo> i have som problems when i boot after i have installed ubuntu or debian when i boot and boot up in ubuntu or debian it's working fine but i have all so windows on my computer on a other hdd.. but if i choose to boot in windows and reboot i get a wierd error i think it is... it boot until i reach loading grub stage 1.5 and reboot again and do it for ever until i install ubuntu or debian again..
[01:59] <oOKenTOo> it is my first time to really try any kind of linux on my computer so don't give me all those fancy words that i don't really get, if you know what i mean...
[01:59] <_garry> But something like "chmod -R 777 www" should also work
[02:00] <_garry> ivx: Just make sure you specify the full path to the directory. Or change to the one above it first
[02:01] <minimec> oOKenTOo: So in fact you can't boot windows, but you can boot on linux.
[02:01] <ivx> _garry yes got it thank you sir
[02:01] <oOKenTOo> minimec: no not after i boot in windows.. after that i have to reinstall linux again..
[02:01] <_garry> ivx: Best to check the manpages for 'find' and 'chmod' in case I got something wrong
=== root is now known as _thomas
[02:01] <|thunder> Can I disable the GDM by changing runlevels? I want text login
[02:02] <trigg3r> I was wondering if anybody knew how to give ubuntu windows ntfs read/write support
[02:02] <|thunder> !fuse
[02:02] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[02:02] <ivx> _garry, it worked, i just did it
[02:02] <minimec> oOKenTOo: And this windows installatin is your old one that you made smaller with a partition tool?
[02:02] <_garry> ivx: Great!
[02:03] <_thomas> hey guys i've completely broken the permissions on my system and it won't let me log into my user accounts. i don't have graphical access to my system at all it just says "directory /home/user doesn't exist" and then it will log back out to gdm. is there any thing i can do to restore sane defaults to the permissions on my system, because as is, it doesn't work at all (graphically anyway)
[02:03] <Virogenesis> hey people, I need to insert a script that will startup a synergy daemon every time my xwindows boots up, basically the linux just has to type synergyc --daemon -n server 192.168.123.33  on Xboot, how do I do that?
[02:04] <First|Bleh> _thomas: manually, from the root account? that's about the only way short of reinstalling.
[02:04] <oOKenTOo> minimec: i allready have installed windows before i intalled linux.. but when i intalled linux i installed it on a new empty hdd..
[02:04] <php-freak> whats does gksudo mean
[02:04] <_garry> _thomas: Start off with 'chown -R thomas.thomas /home/thomas' (substitute your real user name)
[02:04] <php-freak> I know sudo is super user, but whats gksudo
[02:04] <|thunder> _thomas; is your home folder missing ?
[02:05] <darkmatter> php-freak, its a gtk frontend to sudo
[02:05] <_thomas> _garry: ok
[02:05] <|thunder> _thomas; try ctrl-alt-f6
[02:05] <darkmatter> as in avoiding the terminal
[02:05] <php-freak> darkmatter: what do you mean
[02:05] <_thomas> |thunder: i'm in control alt f6 :)
[02:05] <darkmatter> its a gui.
[02:05] <Skwid_> i feel stupid but ... how do I add an icon to /home/user on my desktop ?
[02:05] <mordof> what command is it to display all the computers hardware?
[02:05] <|thunder> _thomas; ok ls -la      is there a home folder there ?  if so can you cd into it ?
[02:06] <minimec> oOKenTOo: Ok. So the two OS are on seperate hdd. And the linux hdd is master?
[02:06] <mordof> i know cat /proc/cpuinfo is for the cpu
[02:06] <mordof> but i don't know the entire comp hardware one
[02:06] <_garry> _thomas: As |thunder says, you need to get to a shell with, e.g. Ctrl-alt-f6
[02:06] <delight> !beryl
[02:06] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl

[02:06] <|thunder> Skwid_; gconf-editor   apps/nautilus/desktop
[02:06] <_garry> Skwid_: Which desktop? Gnome, KDE, XFCE, something_else?
[02:06] <Skwid_> Gnome
[02:06] <_thomas> _garry: i'm at a shell now, i typed that, but i still get permission denied when i try to cd into my ~
[02:06] <oOKenTOo> minimec: my windows hdd is IDE 1 master and the Linux hdd is IDE 2 master
[02:07] <_garry> _thomas: But the directory exists, right?
[02:07] <phoenix_> hi
[02:07] <_thomas> _garry: yes i can browse it with root
=== phoenix_ is now known as firebird
[02:07] <jughead> does anyone still burn in new computers?
[02:07] <|thunder> _thomas; still, can youj cd into the home dir? is so, what are the permissions and owners of your thomas directory ?
[02:07] <SebHal> Virogenesis, "sudo crontab -e" and add " @reboot synergyc --daemon -n server 192.168.123.33 "
[02:07] <Skwid_> |thunder: and then ?
[02:07] <_garry> _thomas: OK, so you (as root) need to change the ownership and perms of the directory
[02:08] <firebird> hi how do i play movie files with .avi,.mpeg in ubuntu
=== keeb is now known as keeb-IRSSI

[02:08] <Skwid_> |thunder: it seems to be empty
[02:08] <minimec> oOKenTOo: grub is stored in which boot sector? hdd-win or hdd-linux?
[02:08] <_thomas> _garry: ok, now you said how to do that before with find, but i've lost it. so what should i type?
[02:08] <firebird> can i install Vlc player in ubuntu
[02:09] <_garry> _thomas: start off by changing ownership: chown -R thomas.thomas /home/thomas (or whatever your user name is)
[02:09] <jrib> firebird: yes, install the vlc package
[02:09] <_thomas> _garry: yep done that
[02:09] <jrib> !info vlc | firebird

[02:09] <oOKenTOo> minimec: hdd-win (i think..not sure...but allmost sure)
[02:09] <computermc> ok thanks
[02:09] <firebird> can i do it with aptget or from the ubuntu package manager
[02:10] <mordof> can anyone tell me the command for bash to display the computer hardware?
[02:10] <mordof> please, heh
[02:10] <jrib> mordof: lspci? lshw?
[02:10] <mordof> oo ty
[02:10] <_garry> _thomas: now do chmod 755 /home/thomas
[02:10] <|thunder> _thomas; try this.   cd /home/      then     chown -R thomas:thomas ./thomas
[02:10] <minimec> oOKenTOo: I would probably set the hdd-linux as IDE 1 slave...
[02:10] <Skwid_> |thunder: there doesnt seem to be a key in that directory
[02:11] <|thunder> a key ?
[02:11] <|thunder> and 5 gives execute privs
[02:11] <oOKenTOo> minimec: hmm okay.. and if that is not working got any others ideas?
[02:11] <minimec> oO or even better ... do a clean linux install and set hdd-linux as IDE1 master and hdd-win as IDE slave and configure burb afterwards...
[02:11] <|thunder> RW is 6
[02:11] <Skwid_> |thunder: when I navigate to your path in gconf, there is nothing
[02:11] <ryanakca> how can you tell if you have ISA slots? (I don't see a 'lsisa' or something like that)
[02:11] <minimec> oOKenTOo: or even better ... do a clean linux install and set hdd-linux as IDE1 master and hdd-win as IDE slave and configure burb afterwards...
[02:12] <|thunder> Skwid_; not on gnome ?
[02:12] <Skwid_> |thunder: yes, i am in gnome
[02:12] <|thunder> Skwid_; then there should be
[02:13] <_garry> _thomas: you melted your box yet?
[02:13] <|thunder> apps/nautilus/desktop
[02:13] <oOKenTOo> minimec: hmm okay... is there any way to remove the grub loader and get the computer to reboot normally?
[02:13] <Skwid_> nope ... definetely no key in /apps/nautilus/desktop
[02:13] <_thomas> _garry: hehe not just yet :)
[02:13] <mordof> _thomas: melted your box.. did you OC it like crazy?
[02:14] <minimec> oOKenTOo: on win or on linux? You have the possibility to configure the master boot secot with the live CD, I think.
[02:14] <_thomas> _garry: ok did that, still can't access it. when i do an ls -l of /home it says that i own it, and all the files in the dir i own. but i still can't cd in there. i seriously don't get whats going on
[02:14] <_thomas> mordof: oc who in the what now?
[02:14] <|thunder> Skwid_; sry mang, there should be 10 of em. that do exactly what you want. you could try making a soft link.
[02:14] <mordof> _thomas: he asked if you had melted your box.. was thinking maybe he meant from overheating, in which case was asking if you had overclocked it, heh
[02:14] <Magic_Boat> Don't forget that functions, like the one above, can be placed in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile so that they are available for use whenever you are in bash. ///how to use a bash function in the .bashrc when you're in bash?
[02:15] <Skwid_> |thunder: how come i have none ? :(
[02:15] <mordof> if not, then i'm entirely misunderstanding and will leave you to your own devices
[02:15] <oOKenTOo> minimec: so i could reboot in windows for now?
[02:15] <_thomas> mordof: haha ok, no i've just borked the shit out of my permissions
[02:15] <_garry> _thomas: enter 'whoami' and tell us the result
[02:15] <|thunder> Skwid_; `using nautilus ?
[02:15] <mordof> _thomas: ohhh, uh oh
[02:15] <Skwid_> |thunder: yeah ...
[02:15] <_thomas> _garry: i'm thomas hehe, yeah the output was thomas
[02:15] <|thunder> you know how to make a soft link ?
[02:15] <Skwid_> |thunder: nope, what is it ?
[02:16] <_garry> _thomas: OK, so as thomas you can't get into your own directory. Can you get in as root?
[02:16] <mordof> hey can anyone tell me how to make a symlink? and what a symlink is!?
[02:16] <|thunder> ln -s target linkfile
[02:16] <minimec> oOKenTOo: Hmm.. Modifying grub... htere should be a possibility, but I am not sure.
[02:16] <_thomas> _garry: do you mean can i cd into /home/thomas?
[02:16] <Skwid_> |thunder: oh, yeah that i know :)
[02:16] <ryanakca> are any crucial components of ubuntu in a.out format?
[02:16] <Thaimaishu> Garry still here?
[02:16] <Thaimaishu> It did not work.
[02:16] <_garry> _thomas: yes, can you cd into /home/thomas when you're root?
[02:16] <|thunder> mordof; you too. ln -s target linkfile
[02:17] <_garry> Thaimaishu: yes, I'm here
[02:17] <Thaimaishu> It didn't work.
[02:17] <Thaimaishu> I have run disk checks and everything, it just goes to the screen with the white cursor, flashes and goes black.
[02:17] <oOKenTOo> minimec: well yeah.. but i don't really know how to, because it is my first time to use linux...
[02:17] <_garry> Thaimaishu: what didn't? My memory isn't so good these days :-)
[02:17] <Thaimaishu> I think there may be a graphics problem.
[02:17] <Thaimaishu> The installation
[02:17] <Skwid_> how do i change the language of gnome-spell ?
[02:17] <mordof> |thunder: ooooh, cause i recently came accross a guide to do some funky install for apache or w/e, and it said to do a symlink.. and i have no idea and it didn't show me so i had to leavce it, heh
[02:17] <_garry> Thaimaishu: Oh, I remember, the black screen
[02:17] <_thomas> _garry: ok so i sudo -s, then i can cd into /home/thomas no worries
[02:18] <Thaimaishu> Yeah, the black screen.
[02:18] <_garry> Thaimaishu: I agree, could be your graphics card
[02:18] <Thaimaishu> Should I try 6.6?
[02:18] <Thaimaishu> 6.06*
[02:18] <_garry> _thomas: so it's probably perms on your directory. Do 'ls -l /home/thomas' What's the output?
[02:18] <mordof> time to convert my server from wink2 pro to ubuntu server! yay
[02:18] <Thaimaishu> Well, I can play games and stuff fine.  World of Warcraft supports fine.  SuSE linux also worked fine.  I have a 256 mb ATI Radeon 9200
[02:19] <_garry> Thaimaishu: worth a shot...
[02:19] <minimec> oOKenTOo: I would set hdd-linux as IDE master and hdd-win as IDE 1 slave... then do a clean ubuntu install. The windows Os should be recignized during the installation process...
[02:19] <Thaimaishu> Alright, now if 6.06 does work, could I upgrade from in it?
[02:19] <_garry> Thaimaishu: I've read about some people having troubles with upgrading from Dapper to Edgy
[02:19] <oOKenTOo> minimec: hmm i'll give it a try.. thanks for the help anyway..
[02:19] <minimec> oOKenTOo: sorry for the typing errors ...
[02:20] <minimec> oOKenTOo: np
[02:20] <_thomas> _garry: ok so its drwxr-xr-x thomas thomas 4096
[02:20] <klees> can someone help me with my /etc/fstab???
[02:20] <_thomas> _garry: everything in there is like that
[02:20] <Skwid_> |thunder: ok, i added all the keys by hand, is there a way to reset the keys in gconf for a specific program ? it's not the first time i'm missing some for nautilus
[02:20] <Thaimaishu> ok, well i'll try out Dapper, see if anything works
[02:20] <klees> doing a df -h doesn't show my root partition
[02:20] <_garry> _thomas: I meant do 'ls -ld /home/thomas'
[02:20] <strabes> !ask | klees
[02:20] <ubotu> klees: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:20] <Thaimaishu> then I can use the 6.1 alt cd I guess
[02:21] <_garry> _thomas: are you saying that /home/thomas is drwxr-xr-x?
[02:21] <klees> well after restoring my system i can not use my previous /etc/fstab
[02:21] <|thunder> Skwid_; you added keys to gconf-editor ? how'd you know which ones to add ?
[02:21] <Uberriffic> anyone have the problem where they play a dvd, and it shows up on hte primary monitor, but when the video itself won't show on a second monitor? (I have laptop LCD hooked up to Projector)
[02:21] <Skwid_> |thunder: http://www.gnome.org/~bmsmith/gconf-docs/C/nautilus.html
[02:21] <klees> i'm not sure if it's because of the UID in it
[02:21] <_thomas> _garry: ok i'll do an ld just a sec, do you want that on the contents or the dir itself?
[02:21] <|thunder> ahh
[02:21] <strabes> klees: what do you mean you cannot 'use' it
[02:21] <Uberriffic> Everything shows up except for the video on the projector. It's strange.
[02:22] <klees> strabes: when i uncomment my root line my mouse doesn't work when the system starts up
[02:22] <_garry> _thomas: I want the perms on /home/thomas and 'ls -ld /home/thomas' should show those
[02:22] <|thunder> Skwid_; they should enable on the fly. but then again. its not expecting them to be there. i dont know why
[02:22] <klees> # /dev/sdb2
[02:22] <klees> UUID=ec9d4829-fc43-41ff-bbd6-d801be3ae835 /

[02:22] <phidaux> anyone have a sec for a Wine question? it's not popping up under "open with" dialog
[02:22] <klees> correction
[02:22] <strabes> klees: your mouse doesn't work because of something that you did in /etc/fstab??? I don't know anything about that
[02:23] <klees> my mouse is disabled if i uncomment that line

[02:24] <[Scythereal] > And computers on the intranet will recognise that?
[02:24] <_thomas> _garry: ok so its drwxr-xr-x , however when i do a ls -ld /home it says its drw-r--r-- twev root 409 (twev is another user on the system) do you think that is whats wrong?
[02:24] <HymnToLife> also don't forget to edit /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts accordingly
[02:25] <klees> strabes: i restored my system so it's using the UID from prior setup
[02:25] <HymnToLife> [Scythereal] , of course not
[02:25] <[Scythereal] >  /etc/hosts on the server?
[02:25] <r00t_> http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=47166
[02:25] <klees> strabes: is it supposed to use a new UID
[02:25] <klees> ?
[02:25] <[Scythereal] > I've edited /etc/HOSTNAME
[02:25] <_garry> _thomas: Yes, that's what's wrong. As root, do 'chown thomas.thomas /home/thomas'
[02:25] <klees> UUID*
[02:25] <HymnToLife> you need to either setup a DNS server or edit /Etc/hosts on each of them
[02:25] <r00t_> anyone can tell me what software is it http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=47166
[02:25] <[Scythereal] > Damn.
[02:25] <zylche> HymnToLife, sudo make ./sandwich > /dev/mouth
[02:25] <_garry> _thomas: then do 'chmod 755 /home/thomas'
[02:26] <_thomas> _garry: no the twev part is on /home not /home/thomas do you get me?
[02:26] <HymnToLife> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/zylche
[02:26] <|thunder> cairo-clock
[02:26] <_garry> _thomas: /home should be owned by root.root
[02:26] <|thunder> it stated that in the 3rd comment
[02:26] <HymnToLife> all right, that was lame
[02:26] <HymnToLife> I _definitely_ need some sleep
[02:26] <strabes> r00t_: that's a theme for cairo-clock
[02:26] <_thomas> _garry: so do a chown root.root /home ?
[02:26] <Skwid_> it appears i'm missing all my keys for nautilus, anyway I can restore them ? i tried reinstalling the package, that didn't work, |thunder an idea ?
[02:26] <_garry> _thomas: chown root.root /home
[02:27] <r00t_> strabes,  where do i get it ?

[02:27] <yanger> in ubuntu, dapper drake, i noticed that /usr/sbin/nologin is not there... is there a way to allow a user ftp access, but block ssh access? when i give him /bin/false, ftp fails as well...

[02:27] <tophat2445> hi
[02:27] <zylche> :(
[02:27] <_thomas> _garry: i think that fixed it just a sec
[02:28] <seanmeir> I added some things to system-preferences-sessions .. and now gnome won't start, how do I remove those things; what is the path to where those are stored?
[02:28] <_garry> _thomas: fixed /home/thomas, maybe, but there's still the small matter of the files/directories in /home/thomas
[02:28] <zylche> sudo /dev/random > /dev/HymnToLife/irc
[02:28] <_thomas> _garry: ok now i can cd into my /home/thomas from thomas
[02:28] <HymnToLife> that obviously won't work, dude ;)
[02:28] <r00t_> tnx
[02:28] <klees> how can i find the UUID of partitions?
[02:28] <HymnToLife> why do you want to ?
[02:28] <jrib> !uuid | klees
[02:29] <ubotu> klees: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[02:29] <HymnToLife> just use /dev/whatever
[02:29] <_garry> _thomas: what do the perms look like in there? i.e. of the subdirectories and files?
[02:29] <_garry> _thomas: In other words, how big a  mess is it in?
[02:29] <green_earz>  yanger:    with /bin/false ftp should be ok, have tryed ftp with /bin/false
[02:29] <klees> jrib: is it required to have the UUID in /etc/fstab?
[02:29] <jrib> klees: no
[02:30] <HymnToLife> klees, nope, /dev/whatever still works
[02:30] <seanmeir> where does system->preferences->sessions store it's files?
[02:30] <HymnToLife> I'and I'm still wondering what the hell the point of using UUIDs is
[02:30] <|thunder> seanmeir; /etc/gdm/
[02:30] <_garry> _thomas: 'ls -l' will give you an idea
[02:30] <_thomas> _garry: there good, except for files that have a leading dot
[02:30] <seanmeir> |thunder, thank you
[02:30] <|thunder> seanmeir; i think, maybe
[02:31] <_garry> _thomas: and what's up with the 'leading-dot' files? Wrong ownership? Wrong perms?
[02:31] <_thomas> _garry: they're all drwxr-xr-x
[02:31] <klees> ok thanks
[02:31] <strabes> _garry: those are hidden files
[02:31] <TiG4-Laptop> ***--- Just installed, Edgy Server, enabled universe and security, tried 'sudo apt-get install ssh', but it asks me to insert my install cd, so I insert it and hit enter, but it never does anything, stuck at, '[Working 0%] ' . Any ideas on how I can make it use apt and not the cd
[02:31] <_garry> _thomas: and is this directories AND files, just directories, or just files?
[02:31] <yanger> green_earz, i'm testing it right now, it doesn't work ;\ i think...
[02:32] <_thomas> _garry: they're -rwxr-xr-x
[02:32] <_thomas> _garry: owned by me
[02:32] <AnthonyG> Modem O' Modem, Connect ye old modem :D
[02:32] <_garry> strabes: thanks, I know they're 'hidden files'. I wanted to know the perms
[02:32] <_garry> _thomas: ok, just need to change those perms
[02:33] <_thomas> _garry: to 755?
[02:33] <HymnToLife> _garry, you need to add the -a parameter to ls to show hidden files
[02:33] <strabes> _garry: ok ok sorry lol
[02:33] <kyd> im haveing trouble with my wireless network.
[02:33] <seanmeir> I added some things to system-preferences-sessions .. and now gnome won't start, how do I remove those things; what is the path to where those are stored?
[02:34] <green_earz> yanger: if i remember right it was with vsftpd that is use the /bin/false
[02:34] <_garry> _thomas: you need to do "find -type f -name '.*' | xargs chmod whatever'
[02:34] <_garry> _thomas: note the quotes round the '.*'
[02:34] <yanger> green_earz, ah, i'm using proftpd
[02:34] <kyd> i can not see the network i am on with my other pc
[02:34] <|thunder> kyd; if your trying to use ndiswrapper. good luck
[02:34] <_garry> _thomas: and 'whatever' should probably be 644
[02:34] <kyd> oh oh.....why?
[02:34] <_garry> HymnToLife: thanks, but I'm not doing the 'ls', _thomas is... :-)
[02:35] <kyd> thunder: im useing ubuntu 6.10
[02:35] <_garry> _thomas: 644 should give you rw-r--r--
[02:35] <|thunder> gotta run.
[02:35] <_thomas> _garry: ok thats read write read read i guess. just a sec
[02:35] <_garry> _thomas: you might want some (or all) of them to be rw-r----- which is 640
[02:36] <_thomas> _garry: and the directories should be 755 right?

[02:38] <eighty> i.e. , don't load gnome desktop stuff
[02:38] <_garry> Virogenesis: look at the stuff in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc2.d
[02:38] <Virogenesis> eighty, edit etc/inittab
[02:38] <green_earz> TiG4-Laptop: on the command line use the command sudo apt-setup and then pick a http mirror

[02:39] <_thomas> _garry: ok hopefully that has fixed everything. you've saved the day mate, i can finally go watch the cricket i think. thanks very much, your patience and knowledge are fantastic

[02:41] <paddygman> can anyone help me to install a version of phpadmin i've just downloaded
[02:41] <_garry> Virogenesis: look at the files in /etc/init.d and use them as a template. You'll see that each has sections to start, stop, and restart the command. If you don't need that much control, just put a file into /etc/init.d that runs whatever...
[02:41] <song> is there a gnome-mount existed in edgy?
[02:41] <TiG4-Laptop> green_earz, sudo apt-setup returns, command not found
[02:41] <Virogenesis> _garry, so you mean add my line along with something else that runs?
[02:41] <_garry> Virogenesis: and put a symlink in /etc/rc2.d (and maybe rc3.d, rc4.d and rc5.d that link to the file in /etc/init.d
[02:42] <eighty> i installed gnome on ubuntu server... how can i get to the terminal app now?
[02:42] <yanger> ahh fixed! thanks!
[02:42] <eighty> not in app menu
[02:42] <paddygman> can anyone help me to install a version of phpadmin i've just downloaded
[02:42] <_garry> Virogenesis: No, I mean put a shell script into /etc/init.d that does whatever you need to run at startup. Then put a symlink into one or more of the /etc/rcX.d directories
[02:42] <Virogenesis> _garry, I just need that file to execute when im in X windows

[02:43] <_garry> Virogenesis: I've only just startedusing Ubuntu. In Suse there's a Startup directory somewhere in your home directory where you put stuff that you want to have run in X
[02:43] <budluva> eighty, alt-f2 then type xterm
[02:43] <_garry> Virogenesis: That's what I was suggesting

[02:44] <nickv111> Hey, guys, this is weird. When I boot into the install CD, my sound card is recognized as an HDA ATI SB, and all of the mixers recognize it as so. However, when I boot into my recently-installed system, the sound card is recognized as a Realtek ACL883. Weirdest of all, when I do cat /proc/asound/cards, it returns "HDA ATI SB" correctly when in my install, which is correct. I really just wish my sound card were recognized right.

[03:02] <Thaimaishu> Hello all, I want to know if there is a certain problem with my Ubuntu.  I am trying to install it, and when it starts to like I guess load with the live features, then I can try it and stuff.  It will get stuck after the loading screen.  It will have a black screen with a blinking cursor at the top left of my moniter.  It will then go into a black screen.  Has anyone had this problem, or know any fixes associated with it?

[03:05] <trilliji> Ok, my solution won't work for you then
[03:05] <Thaimaishu> Max speed, but I did the disc check, and it said no errors were found.
[03:05] <AnthonyG> Max speed is bad
[03:05] <AnthonyG> 4x Maximum
[03:05] <jessie> hello, i want to get grip to encode to ogg. what do i have to change the command to (its at oggenc right now)
[03:05] <Thaimaishu> k.
[03:05] <Thaimaishu> I'll go give it another try.  If not I'll reburn.
[03:05] <bitflip> Skwid_: nm - a typo on my part - trying to ascertain what your problem was
[03:05] <trilliji> Ah, a 9200? Is this on Edgy?
=== rdz2 is now known as rdz
[03:05] <Thaimaishu> Yeah it's on edgy
[03:05] <Skwid_> bitflip: i figured that out :)
[03:05] <Thaimaishu> It won't even start up the live part so I can even begin to install.
[03:05] <AnthonyG> 2x if possible , I never had the time, 4x never gives me problems.
[03:06] <trilliji> Does it work on Dapper?
[03:06] <Skwid_> bitflip: how do i reload my gconf to match what's in /home/user/.gconf ???
[03:06] <Thaimaishu> Didn't try that yet.
[03:06] <Thaimaishu> Should I try dapper?
[03:06] <Thaimaishu> I have it dl'd
[03:06] <AnthonyG> First try a lower speed
[03:06] <jessie> hello, i want to get grip to encode to ogg. what do i have to change the command to (its at oggenc right now)
[03:06] <trilliji> I have a 9200 running on dapper
[03:06] <AnthonyG> Most problems are trivial such as this.
[03:06] <tx22> Any linux mint fans in here tonight?
[03:06] <bitflip> Skwid_: not sure?  I'm a late bloomer to gnome if you will
[03:06] <Thaimaishu> Ah ok, tgabjs Trill!
[03:06] <Thaimaishu> I'll try that!
[03:06] <brussel> does ubuntu come with a firewall?
[03:06] <trilliji> Thaimaishu: Also, I'd burn an alternate install disk, much easier install with those
[03:07] <darksmiley> skwid: i'm confused by that... why doesn't it match your .gconf? what's wrong with it?
[03:07] <tx22> brussel:  no, but you can download one. it is inhritely secure
[03:07] <paddygman> brussel u can get one from apt-get
[03:07] <jessie> hello, i want to get grip to encode to ogg. what do i have to change the command to (its at oggenc right now)

[03:08] <jessie> hello, i want to get grip to encode to ogg. what do i have to change the command to (its at oggenc right now)
[03:08] <brussel> ok, is there a consensus on which firewall i should download if i'd like to plug ubuntu directly into the broadband modem?
[03:08] <darksmiley> ubuntu rules by the way, it's my first time using it i just installed it today!
[03:08] <nubuntusamot> i need some help here
[03:08] <darksmiley> i've been using suse and slackware for about 2 years, but ubuntu has to be my fave =D
[03:08] <nubuntusamot> grub problems
[03:08] <paddygman> can anyone help me to install a version of phpadmin i've just downloaded
[03:08] <Pelo> nubuntusamot,  way to narrow it down
[03:08] <nubuntusamot> what>?

[03:09] <darksmiley> yeah nubuntusamot... we all have grub problems!
[03:09] <Pelo> paddygman,  http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[03:09] <darksmiley> lol
[03:09] <Random_Transit> brussel, if you wanna spend the time building a rock solid firewall, use good ol' iptables...otherwise, firestarter is quite nice
[03:09] <trilliji> brussel: The firewall is in the kernel, most likely it is a firewall config tool you are looking for
[03:09] <ozoneco> what the diff on tcp and tcp6?
[03:09] <jessie> hello, i want to get grip to encode to ogg. what do i have to change the command to (its at oggenc right now)
[03:09] <Eroick> I distupgraded to edgy eft and now my wifi card doesn't work with ndiswrapper. I try to modprobe ndiswrapper and it says that ndiswrapper is an invalid argument
[03:09] <nubuntusamot> yeah right... but i-m running a live/cd cuz i cant boot my harddrive!
[03:09] <AnthonyG> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=309659 -> :'(
[03:09] <darksmiley> oh, the FIREWALL thing, does ubuntu have iptables in it's kernel?
[03:09] <darksmiley> i take it it does?
[03:09] <Thaimaishu> I'm back again.
[03:09] <Thaimaishu> Is there a DVD download for the Dapepr?
[03:09] <AnthonyG> How goes it?
[03:09] <trilliji> brussel: I find firestarter to be pretty simple
[03:10] <Thaimaishu> Dapper*  We ran out of CD's that are normal I think, I only have DVD-RW
[03:10] <Pelo> nubuntusamot,  still doesn'T tell us what the problem is
[03:10] <trilliji> Thaimaishu: It fits on a cd
[03:10] <jessie> Eroick, try "dpkg-reconfigure ndiswrapper
[03:10] <urmom> i need help with mac on linux
[03:10] <Pelo> Thaimaishu,  yes there is,   try bittorrent for  it's the easyest way,    www.torrentz.com
[03:10] <urmom> can anyone help me with it?
[03:10] <Thaimaishu> Yeah, but can ISO's go on DVD RW?
[03:11] <Thaimaishu> Or do I need the special DVD ISO for it?
[03:11] <trilliji> hmm, don't know.
[03:11] <Thaimaishu> Anthony?
[03:11] <AnthonyG> Hm?
[03:11] <nubuntusamot> ok.... so i have tried several times to install nubuntu on my hard drvive but when it cames to install the grub it crashes! Is it the device i have chosen to install to? I want it on MBR....
[03:11] <Thaimaishu> Do I need DVD-ISO's to use DVD-RW
[03:11] <AnthonyG> No
[03:11] <Thaimaishu> So a normal Dapper ISO will run on it?
[03:11] <Pelo> Thaimaishu,  you only need to find a torrent for  ubuntu 6.06 dvd iso  that is all
[03:11] <AnthonyG> Yes
[03:11] <Thaimaishu> Yeah, that'll take too long.
[03:12] <job> Yes u need DVD-ISO
[03:12] <Thaimaishu> Thanks Anthony I'll try the DVD then.
[03:12] <nubuntusamot> helooooooo
[03:12] <brussel> well if ubuntu is inherently stable does that mean i can connect directly to the net and not worry?
[03:12] <AnthonyG> I've burn't data to DVDs that has nothing to do with DVDs whatsoever.
[03:12] <AnthonyG> That was terrible grammar
[03:12] <trilliji> annoy me though
[03:12] <job> ISO?
[03:12] <AnthonyG> But you get the drift XD
[03:12] <AnthonyG> What about them?
[03:12] <trilliji> oops
[03:12] <Pelo> nubuntusamot,   try looking for an answer on the forum ,search for the mbr thing
[03:13] <ozoneco>  sudo netstat -natlp | grep 22
[03:13] <Pelo> brussel,  worry about what ?
[03:13] <ozoneco> that mean something to somebody?
[03:13] <job> there is always a version of DVD-ISO. I never heard of a CD-ISO going on a DVD
[03:14] <zylche> I've used .iso's for dvds a lot..
[03:14] <job> does not hurt to try though
[03:14] <Thaimaishu> I'll google it.
[03:14] <brussel> Pelo, i want to set up a web server and i'm worried if i just connect ubuntu directly to the cable modem i'll be in trouble
[03:14] <Thaimaishu> oh ok then.
[03:14] <vader> same here job but I will try it tomorrow or so
[03:14] <bitflip> jkl;'
[03:14] <Thaimaishu> It's settled.  I'm gonna try
[03:14] <AnthonyG> Thaumaishu: It will work fine
[03:14] <Thaimaishu> Thanks for all the encouragement folks
[03:14] <Pelo> brussel,  what trouble would you be in ??? that's what I don'T get
[03:15] <AnthonyG> Don't worry about ISO differences, There are none.
[03:15] <brussel> Pelo, well somebody hacking into the this computer and erasing the HD for instance.
[03:15] <AnthonyG> For the most part anyway.
[03:15] <AnthonyG> Hackers used to be a handle for programmers.
[03:15] <Pelo> brussel,  that has nothing to do with stability ,  stability is about not crashing for no apparent reason
[03:16] <Thaimaishu> uhh crap.  It's not DVD-RW it's DVD-R
[03:16] <Pelo> brussel,  if you are worried about security stuff there are firewalls you can install
[03:16] <maddog39> I am in DESPERATE need of a good PHP IDE
[03:16] <maddog39> jEdit stopped working
[03:16] <AnthonyG> RW=Rewrite
[03:16] <darksmiley> ok, i'm off for now i'm going to reboot and stuff - thanks for the help guys and keep linuxing!
[03:16] <tomh--> maddog39 zend studio
[03:16] <AnthonyG> R will be fine for a single write
[03:16] <Thaimaishu> I know, I thought it was RW, it's R
[03:16] <Pelo> brussel,  and linux is generaly more secure then other OS
[03:16] <AnthonyG> I agree:D
[03:17] <Thaimaishu> My burn speed is at 1.0x
[03:17] <brussel> Pelo, well I'm looking at firestarter and thinking this is much too complex if it doesn't add much other than what ubuntu already has
[03:17] <maddog39> Mac OS is probably more or as secure as Linux
[03:17] <DarkED> i all
[03:17] <maddog39> because its unix based
[03:17] <DarkED> I have a quick question
[03:17] <maddog39> wats that
[03:17] <AnthonyG> Thaimiashu: You sir, Have great time on your hands :D
[03:17] <jrib> !ask | DarkED
[03:17] <ubotu> DarkED: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:17] <AnthonyG> 4x Worked fine for me :)
[03:17] <Pelo> brussel,   I don'T use a firewall and I feel safe enough, I don'T use a router either
[03:17] <tomh--> all os more secure then linux which is more secure then windows~
[03:17] <Thaimaishu> Well it says that it's going at 1.0x
[03:17] <tomh--> *are more
[03:17] <Thaimaishu> I didn't mean to put it there, and I forgot to change it from max speed.
[03:18] <tomiboi> Can Apache +PHP+MySQL be installed on 6.06 LTS desktop
[03:18] <Thaimaishu> My max is 48x.  It is still going at one
[03:18] <DarkED> I am going to use Ubuntu again for the first time since 6.06 was released
[03:18] <jrib> !lamp | tomiboi
[03:18] <DarkED> should I go 6.06 or 6.10?
[03:18] <ubotu> tomiboi: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[03:18] <Thaimaishu> Edgy is hard.
[03:18] <AnthonyG> Thaimaishu: Why?
[03:18] <tomiboi> thanks
[03:18] <AnthonyG> Edgy rulez.
[03:18] <maddog39> http://www.apachefriends.org << DOwnload XAMPP solve ur webservers problems
[03:18] <AnthonyG> As does the kernel
[03:18] <Thaimaishu> DarkEd: I'm doing 6.06 Edgy failed to install
[03:18] <Pelo> brussel,  here is another alternative to firestarter   http://qtables.radom.org/
[03:18] <maddog39> fully packaged webserver binary
[03:18] <maddog39> has PHP5, MySQL5
[03:18] <maddog39> and everything else
[03:19] <DarkED> Edgy failed to install? Well, doesn't it have the installer on the livecd?
[03:19] <AnthonyG> :'( -> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=309659
[03:19] <jrib> DarkED: both are good choices.  If you want to not upgrade for a long time then you may want to use dapper since it will get security updates longer.  Edgy has the advantage that the software is more recent
[03:19] <dsnyders> My hard drive crashed, and I tried using e2retrieve to recover.  What do you do with the three files it creates?
[03:19] <DarkED> jrib: Yeah, upgrading wouldnt bother me much, so I think I'll try Edgy :D
[03:19] <DarkED> Thanks all
[03:19] <Thaimaishu> Dude, it just blew the disc.
[03:19] <brussel> Pelo, quicktables is no longer being supports
[03:19] <brussel> supported
[03:20] <AnthonyG> Lol
=== skypa_ is now known as skypa
[03:20] <Pelo> brussel,  yeah I just noticed,
[03:20] <AnthonyG> What do you mean blew the disc?
[03:20] <uruguaian> hi, i want to isntall GCC.. i need to dowload packages to use gcc?
[03:20] <uruguaian> not only with the cd?
[03:21] <Thaimaishu> The disc write failed.
[03:21] <AnthonyG> build-essential takes care of it.
[03:21] <vader> AnthonyG, I was wondering the same thing
[03:21] <Thaimaishu> It just popped out said disc failed but wrote something so now it's unuseable
[03:21] <AnthonyG> You must grasp the concept of write speed padawan XD
[03:21] <CorpseFeeder> my java installation is messed up. java apps can't launch my default browser anymore. How can I fix this?
[03:21] <DarkED> question about Ubuntu in general, does anyone use a Novatel Wireless Merlin card through SprintPCS?
[03:21] <kurisutofuaa> Does anyone know off the top of there heads that the Edgy am64bit liveCD has support for a ATI Radeon x800 XL?
[03:22] <uruguaian> hi, i want to isntall GCC.. i need to dowload packages to use gcc?
[03:22] <uruguaian> not only with the cd?
[03:23] <AnthonyG> sudo...
[03:23] <Thaimaishu> Dude, I didn't change anything.  It just dropped
[03:23] <AnthonyG> apt-get install build-essential
[03:23] <brussel> Maybe I should ask, should i expect hackers trouble if i run a lamp server on my ubuntu desktop 6.10 release without putting a firewall on it first?
[03:24] <Renan_s2> brussel, unlikely, but it doesn't hurt to put a firewall
[03:24] <AnthonyG> You have a small chance of penetration on a Linux based server, But a firewall won't hurt.
[03:24] <zspada15> AnthonyG, really?
[03:24] <brussel> normally i like penetration...
[03:24] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: not in terms of native accelerated driver, no
[03:24] <brussel> sorry, couldn't help myself
[03:24] <zspada15> brussel, you dirty perv lol
[03:24] <AnthonyG> brussel: Oh that's special <_<
[03:25] <AnthonyG> zspada15: Less than that of which we don't speak :)
[03:25] <brussel> now i've just installed firestarter, any tips on getting it going?
[03:25] <zspada15> brussel, matches
[03:26] <AnthonyG> brussel: I could make an enuendo from that, But I have dignity XD
[03:26] <vader> lol
[03:26] <zspada15> vader, about what?
[03:26] <DarkED> sweet, Edgy is downloading
[03:26] <CorpseFeeder> What should I have under "Command to launch default browser" in the advanced tab of Sun Java 5.0 Plugin control panel???? Because my firefox will not launch from any java apps anymore.. help!
[03:26] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: I keep getting a X server error every-time I try to load the livecd that's why asked about the ati drivers.
[03:26] <vader> matches zspada15
[03:26] <AnthonyG> Matches "ftw"
[03:27] <brussel> lol, i don't know about dignity, never had it. Anyways, now that i've installed firestarter how the heck do i access it?
[03:27] <zspada15> AnthonyG, would you prefer a lighter to get the fire going?
[03:27] <AnthonyG> XD
[03:27] <zspada15> brussel, system-administration-firestarted
[03:27] <Pelo> brussel,  the menu,   it's got a gui

[03:27] <AnthonyG> It amuses me when someone asks: "What's a terminal?".
[03:28] <DarkED> Hey, one more question, I've never tried to run Ubuntu on a
[03:28] <DarkED> er, sorry, A slow system before
[03:28] <AnthonyG> Xubuntu
[03:28] <vader> Xubnutu DarkED
[03:28] <DarkED> This laptop has a 700mhz Celeron w/ 196meg RAM
[03:28] <AnthonyG> Bwahaha
[03:28] <AnthonyG> Xubuntu For You :)
[03:28] <DarkED> and a 4meg Matrox videocard
[03:28] <wastrel> hi i have an avi file that is sideways & i need to rotate it, what program can i use for this?  <3
[03:28] <AnthonyG> O_O
[03:29] <AnthonyG> Wait a moment
[03:29] <AnthonyG> That may be trouble ,Even for Xubuntu
[03:29] <DarkED> Well see, XP isn't actually all that bad...
[03:29] <AnthonyG> I beg to differ
[03:29] <zspada15> wastrel, gimp?
[03:29] <zspada15> DarkED, i plead to differ
[03:29] <DarkED> No, XP sucks. I'm saying it doesnt run badly at all on this laptop
[03:29] <jrib> wastrel: mencoder
[03:29] <DarkED> Only when I have all kinds of stuff running
[03:30] <brussel> well firestarter seems to be up and running
[03:30] <zspada15> oh
[03:30] <zspada15> DarkED, xp runs on my 350 mhz pentium 2 with 256 megs of ram flawlessly
[03:30] <wastrel> <3
[03:30] <brussel> i'm sure there must be some gotcha to it
[03:30] <DarkED> zspada15: exactly, but will Xubuntu run as good?
[03:30] <jrib> wastrel: mplayer has a video filter for rotating, so I assume it would work
[03:30] <DarkED> I know that Linux is a 'lite' OS
[03:30] <zspada15> DarkED, its a bit slow running ubuntu
[03:31] <DarkED> well as far as system resource goes
[03:31] <zspada15> but thats because of the gui
[03:31] <LineOf7s> The min requirements for Ubuntu list a P2-300 or something, 128MB of memory and about 2GB of disk space.  Is that as mind-numbingly understated as is sounds?
[03:31] <AnthonyG> Linux is not an OS my friend :) , It's a kernel.
[03:31] <zspada15> we know
[03:31] <DarkED> AnthonyG: yeah but you know what I meant :D
[03:31] <zspada15> the OS is ubuntu which is a combo
[03:31] <zspada15> its actually based on system V
[03:32] <AnthonyG> DarkED: Yes, I'm just a bully
[03:32] <zspada15> which was the unix from the 1970s
[03:32] <zspada15> my gramma remembers using IBM system VI
[03:32] <DarkED> Well... I guess I'll try it, couldn't hurt I guess
[03:32] <AnthonyG> I wrote my own kernel , Following docs in Assembly. I gave up after text buffers XD
[03:32] <vader> DarkED, you will love it
[03:32] <zspada15> AnthonyG, how old are you?
[03:33] <kurisutofuaa> I keep getting a X server error [X server Fatal server error: No screens found]  every-time I try to load the Edgy amd64 livecd anyone what I should do?
[03:33] <AnthonyG> zspada15: Does it matter?
=== keeb-IRSSI is now known as keeb`away
[03:33] <zspada15> AnthonyG, yes
[03:33] <zspada15> kurisutofuaa, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:33] <AnthonyG> zspda15: No , It doesn't, And I am a private person thank you ;)
[03:33] <zspada15> AnthonyG, are you over 18 and below 35?
[03:33] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: a cursory search with google show edgy seems to have some problems with x800 xl (regardless x86_32 or x86_64) seeing lots of "I have problem ..." but not many answers in response
[03:34] <AnthonyG> zspada15: Perhaps, But it isn't relavent to Linux, Or Ubuntu now is it?
[03:34] <DarkED> vader: yeah i loved 6.06 and 5.10... but those ran on a P4 3000mhz with a gig of ram :D
[03:35] <AnthonyG> DarkED: I envy you :)
[03:35] <dougsko> anyone here ever get their s-video out working and wants to pastebin their xorg.conf?
[03:35] <eegore> has package support improved for 64 bit dapper?
[03:35] <DarkED> AnthonyG: yeah, too bad that laptop is dead now =/
[03:35] <AnthonyG> Shame...
[03:35] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yup that is way I came here to see if anyone found the work around for it
[03:35] <DarkED> So, gotta make due with what I have
[03:35] <DarkED> which is a 1999 Compaq Armada lol
[03:35] <AnthonyG> DarkED: What did you do to it?
[03:36] <AnthonyG> DarkED: Laptops don't cease themselves ;)
[03:36] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: you might have to install your fglrx manually
[03:36] <vader> DarkED, I ran 5.10 on a p2 366 Dell laptop with 256 mb RAM lol
[03:36] <DarkED> AnthonyG: Actually, this one did. Bulging capacitors, a burned up CMOS, various burns on the mainboard. Stuff I tried to fix (and got it to post once) but couldn't.
[03:37] <shriphani_> i run 6.06 on a laptop with 256 mb ram
[03:37] <DarkED> That is what you get with a cheaper laptop
[03:37] <ezenu> With VMWare and Windows XP, is there any difference/benefit of using FAT32 vs NTFS?
[03:37] <DarkED> To all those in the market, don't EVER buy an Averatec
[03:37] <vader> DarkED, I use HP lol
[03:37] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: that would be nice if i could install edgy
[03:37] <shriphani_> the box has been up for 11 days
[03:37] <AnthonyG> DarkED: Thank you for the advice :D , I choose HP for the man on a budget.
[03:37] <shriphani_> i did a restart 18 hrs ago though
=== shriphani_ is now known as shriphani
[03:38] <DarkED> AnthonyG: Good choice, that or Gateway. They have been coming up in quality as well
[03:38] <ezenu> Guess I'll do NTFS, and use samba too
[03:38] <AnthonyG> DarkED: Of course, If I'm desperate enough.
[03:39] <DarkED> My friend just bought a GW for $849 and got a Core Duo, 1.5gig DDR2-600, a 128meg GeForce, 15.4 @ 1280x800 (same as mine)
[03:39] <shriphani> AnthonyG, is excessive uptime bad for a lappy ?
[03:39] <slickwillythekid> hi, i just switched from windows and mIRC, can I use this with packetnews like I did mIRC?
[03:39] <DarkED> shriphani: Yes
[03:39] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: so your live CD session hangs, or X just wont start?
[03:39] <AnthonyG> Too much uptime is bad for any machine.
[03:40] <vader> slickwillythekid, I have no cluse
[03:40] <AnthonyG> A notebook is certainly no exception.
[03:40] <vader> clue lol
[03:40] <DarkED> shriphani: its not so bad for a desktop because the parts are easily replaceable, but for a laptop where everything is pretty much on one board, YES it is :D
[03:40] <shriphani> hmm so 11 days with a restart 18 hrs ago is bad
[03:40] <slickwillythekid> thanks
[03:40] <AnthonyG> Yes
[03:40] <AnthonyG> Four days is pushing it.
[03:40] <shriphani> i'll give the box a rest tonight
[03:40] <AnthonyG> Superb idea
[03:40] <wastrel> i never turn off my laptop
[03:40] <DevC> ok..what is the newest mysqlclient library? libmysqlclient15off isn't it?
[03:41] <shriphani> wastrel, you are like me!!!!
[03:41] <AnthonyG> I spoke to someone that had a machine running for 11 years.
[03:41] <vader> AnthonyG, I use suspend a lot on this lappy for the simple reason I don't like to wait for the boot process
[03:41] <neosiris> noob question:  what can I do if apt-get doesn't seem to know about sqlite?  I've installed sqlite3 with apt-get before... but it's just not there.  apt-cache search sqlite yields plenty of libraries, but not the CLI for sqlite itself.
[03:41] <AnthonyG> vader: Booting is the best part of a PC in my opinion.
[03:41] <aleka> how can find out what my graphics card is and its specs??
[03:41] <AnthonyG> lspci
[03:41] <bitflip> aleka: lspci(?)
[03:42] <vader> ty bitflip couldn't remember the command
[03:42] <Pelo> neosiris,  try lookng for a package in synaptic if that doesn'T work, install from source,  instructions here  http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/

[03:42] <AnthonyG> Someone will respond to my tears sooner or later.
[03:42] <aleka> bitflip, this outputs a lot of information.
[03:43] <AnthonyG> aleka: Indeed
[03:43] <neosiris> Pelo: I'm doing this on a VPS, so no Synaptic for me :)  only command-line.  thanks for the link, I'll check it.
[03:43] <AnthonyG> aleka: Look for your card name in it
[03:43] <DevC> ok..what is the newest mysqlclient library? libmysqlclient15off isn't it?  or am I reading the libmysqlclient wrong in apt-cache search ://
[03:43] <CarlF1> 3Dfx Interactive, Inc. Voodoo Banshee - how do I use the s-video port?

[03:44] <eighty_> errr,,, how do i enable remote access on ubuntu server?
[03:44] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: hang on a second, I have an idea
[03:44] <AnthonyG> Video cards aren't too hard to find.

[03:44] <AnthonyG> They always have N-Vidia or ATI brands on them XD.
[03:44] <DevC> AnthonyG: what are you getting that error for?
[03:44] <AnthonyG> 80% of my IT experience is ATI or Nvidia
[03:44] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: okay
[03:45] <AnthonyG> DevC: Error?
[03:45] <bitflip> aleka: not sure - my gf runs ubuntu with that card, the GL screensavers work fine but not sure aobut xgl or beryl
[03:45] <CarlF1> eighty_: sudo apt-get instal openssh-server
[03:45] <eighty_> did that carlf1
[03:45] <eighty_> is that it?
[03:45] <eighty_> remote access doesn't seem to be working
[03:45] <zspada15> anyone know how to customize the latest 2.18 kernel?
[03:45] <DevC> no carrier I consider an error since you should be getting a carrier :P
[03:45] <CarlF1> eighty_: define 'remote access' ?
[03:45] <AnthonyG> DevC: GASP , Someone read my topic

[03:48] <aleka> like a 32MB or 64MB.. and so on
[03:48] <eighty_> what about hosts.allow in /etc
[03:48] <eighty_> that need anything special?
[03:48] <DevC> cause back when I used RedHat I had a lot of issues with my dial up but managed to fix it....let me look at the stuff you posted and see if I can think of anything
[03:48] <Eclypse> does anyone know if it's possible to install all of the security-related packages/utilitys in nubuntu?

[03:50] <eighty_> ok, now get ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
[03:50] <eighty_> sup wit dat? :)
[03:50] <DevC> AnthonyG: what is the [SNIP]  part of ATDT? I never had to pass that when I had a dialup modem
[03:50] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: what you want is to specify the following:  xforcevesa *but* I'm not sure how to specifiy that on a live CD startup
[03:50] <bitflip> some else knowledgable enough to answer that for me?
[03:51] <AnthonyG> DevC: The dial number, I'm a paranoid fool I know.
[03:51] <DevC> AnthonyG: ok that is fair enough just needed to understand that part :)
[03:52] <trilliji> Anyone have any ideas for getting automount to work again. Went to  gnome-volume-properties, and I have mount removable drives when hot plugged checked, mount removable media when inserted checked, and browse removable media when inserted checked
[03:52] <trilliji> This is for a usb drive
[03:53] <trilliji> When I insert it, the light comes on for a bit, but then goes out
[03:53] <Eclypse> does anyone know if it's possible to install all of the security-related packages/utilitys from nubuntu in ubuntu?
[03:53] <trilliji> This used to work
[03:53] <vader> Has anyone had a problem installing Xubuntu on a p2 350?
[03:53] <DarkED> Hey all, is there a place on the Wiki I can look at a hardware compatibility list for Edgy, or such?
[03:54] <DevC> AnthonyG: the no carrier means you are not getting an answer to the number you are dialing, right?.. had that before, let me search my old RH posts to see if I can find what I finally did to fix it
[03:54] <drael_> Can anyone help me get the crossfade plugin working in XMMS?
[03:54] <AnthonyG> DevC: Finally, Decent assistance, Thank you :)
[03:55] <eighty_> any other clues on ssh?
[03:55] <fjf314> Hey guys, I have a quick question about trying to install 6.10
[03:55] <DevC> AnthonyG: No problem I had the same issue with my old dialup on red hat
[03:55] <eighty_> getting the ssh_exchange_iden error
[03:55] <trilliji> vader: I don't thing very many people have those any more
[03:55] <trilliji> thing=think
[03:55] <AnthonyG> DevC: It's driving me insane :'(
[03:55] <fjf314> Whenever I install, I get an error message saying, "Failed to start the X server... blah blah blah."
[03:55] <Pelo> AnthonyG,  make sure that you only get problems DevC  can solve , cause he's the only help you'll get from now on
[03:56] <fjf314> So I did some looking around on Google and found this command to run from the command prompt after the error:
[03:56] <vader> trilliji, I realize but I volunteer at a not for proffit and they give pc's to the less fortunate
[03:56] <fjf314> "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[03:56] <DarkED> fjf314: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:56] <fjf314> I enter that and go through a bunch of menus, answer various questions.
[03:56] <AnthonyG> Pelo: Indeed, First and last :)
[03:56] <DarkED> choose the defaults
[03:56] <DevC> AnthonyG: yeah I think I worked on it for months and then suddenly the last thing I tried before giving up worked lol
[03:56] <DarkED> use VESA as display device
[03:56] <DarkED> then install the drivers for your hardware :D
[03:56] <fjf314> DarkED: Well, I entered that command went through all of the menus, but afterward it just dumps me back at the command prompt.
[03:57] <fjf314> And I can't figure out how to try the install again.
[03:57] <AnthonyG> DevC: I'd rather have it work for a few months and know it does indeed work , Then not at all.
[03:57] <DarkED> fjf314: AHH, type startx
[03:57] <Pelo> fjf314,  that's how it is suppose to work,  when in doubt about the answers just use the default
[03:57] <fjf314> Pelo: Haha, that was basically what I did.
[03:57] <trilliji> Vader: You might want to consider Xbuntu or Ubuntu + xfce
[03:57] <fjf314> DarkED: Alright, thanks a lot!  I was more or less just navigating through the menus and feeling lost.
[03:57] <DarkED> fjf314: get it up?
[03:58] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: you still here?
[03:58] <fjf314> Well, I'm going to have to reboot to the CD and try to install again.
[03:58] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yup
[03:58] <fjf314> So we'll see in a little bit.
[03:58] <fjf314> Thanks a lot for the help, I really appreciate it!
[03:58] <DarkED> fjf314: no problem, good luck
[03:58] <vader> that were my ? trilliji if someone had troubles installing Xubuntu on one
[03:58] <QUEEN> Hi
[03:59] <AnthonyG> Hello :D
[03:59] <QUEEN> all i need help on something and it is life or death!
[03:59] <DarkED> Hmm... any particular reason why the Ubuntu iso download is going super slow?
[03:59] <DarkED> as in slow, I mean 16kb/s
[03:59] <wastrel> do tell
[03:59] <aleka> Has anyone in here tried installing Beryl/Compiz on an Intel integrated graphics card?? Is this not a good idea?// My screen already traces windows if I drag them around....
[03:59] <Pelo> QUEEN,  spit it out
[03:59] <DarkED> I'm not a leech :D
[04:00] <Pelo> !beryl | aleka
[04:00] <ubotu> aleka: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[04:00] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: when you insert the liveCD you can press F6 - do you see the word "splash"?
[04:00] <QUEEN> i need to get ubuntu or kubuntu to realise when i insert a blank CD so far it cant tell I am insering the disk
[04:00] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yup
[04:00] <dsnyders> My hard drive crashed, and I tried using e2retrieve to recover.  What do you do with the three files it creates?
[04:00] <DevC> AnthonyG: just covering all bases, but you have your username, password, DNS numbers, and phone number for connecting to your ISP account set up with the dialup program in wvdial.conf
[04:00] <Pelo> DarkED,  bittorrent ??  be patient it will pick up
[04:00] <trilliji> Vader: I can tell you that PIII-667 runs Dapper fairly will with a GeForce4-440
[04:00] <DarkED> Pelo: Nope, Direct from ubuntu
[04:00] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: remove it (splash) that should allow you to drop down to a term once X fails
[04:00] <DevC> or the ppp programthat connects to the ISP
[04:01] <QUEEN> can someone please message me and help me
[04:01] <aleka> thnx pelo
[04:01] <AnthonyG> DevC: DNS? Erm.. On 56K?
[04:01] <Pelo> DarkED,   then you are splitting the ftp speed with other ppl,   I recommend bittorrent,  you can use the partial to get started
[04:01] <vader> I know trilliji I ran 6.06 on my wifes p3 667. I just need to find out of any problems the people may have had with Xubuntu lol
[04:01] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: I am trying that now
[04:01] <Pelo> QUEEN,  look it up in the forum
[04:01] <ryanakca> how can I tell if I need PCI IDE chipset support?
[04:01] <QUEEN> i have tried that and to be honest i am near suicide over this
[04:02] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: you'll then need to $(EDTOR) /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change "ati" or "fglrx" to "vesa" - that's the bug, it ignores xforcevesa
[04:02] <DevC> AnthonyG: yeah all ISPs require usually you DNS numbers to connect to the ISP even for old 56k dialup
[04:02] <QUEEN> and as for posting on the forum it wont happen again I made that mistake tonight :(
[04:02] <DevC> usually two DNS *
[04:02] <Pelo> QUEEN,   if you are suicidal over this you need more help then this channel can provide
[04:02] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: then restart gdm and it should be good to go X wise
[04:02] <AnthonyG> DevC: I wasn't aware of this.... As I was never asked before.
[04:03] <vader> Cat2, it is awesome, aint it?
[04:03] <DarkED> Well thanks everyone
[04:03] <Pelo> QUEEN,   try to adjust the option for blanck cd in   menu: system > prefs > removable media
[04:03] <QUEEN> well my life is ruined because of ubuntu
[04:03] <DevC> AnthonyG: that may be the reason it can't find the carrier because most ISPs need at least 2 DNS numbers to connect to
[04:03] <Cat2> it's good and free, but now i have a useless windoze disk lying around
[04:04] <vader> Cat2, lol
[04:04] <QUEEN> i cant find an option for that
[04:04] <trilliji> Vader:I have an old AMD K6-2 that runs ubuntu + afce on a pci radeon 9100. Make sure to use two disks for raid 0
[04:04] <QUEEN> please help
[04:04] <vader> trilliji, I just want to be sure that what we give the people is worth all of the effort
[04:05] <AnthonyG> DevC: I'm still in awe, 56K DNS.... Now how am I supposed to know what these are?
[04:05] <Pelo> queen  http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84
[04:05] <wastrel> QUEEN:  are you using gnome?
[04:05] <CorpseFeeder> apparently my java plugin control panel is set up properly for launching default browser but it still won't work damnit. why? this sucks
[04:05] <DevC> AnthonyG: for my dial up from a company called HoosierNet I had 2 DNS numbers I had to connect to and even now with Cable modem from Insight Cable I have 2 DNS numbers
[04:05] <DevC> AnthonyG: you have to get them from you ISP provider
[04:05] <trilliji> vader: Graphics is the big challenge, old boxes like that unless they have tnt2 cards or something like that won't be great.
[04:06] <AnthonyG> DevC: I never got any such thing from my ISP
[04:06] <trilliji> You will need to stick to 2d drivers
[04:06] <AnthonyG> DevC: Even when I set pppconfig to Dynamic DNS and use pon I get the same error.
[04:06] <vader> trilliji, I don't want great. The people we give the systems to are welfare and we even send system to Nigeria and places of that sort
[04:07] <QUEEN> all if I dont find a way so that I can get my cd burner to know I am putting in a blank disk so I can burn a cd I am gonna hurt myself I am sick of this and the lack of help im getting
[04:07] <trilliji> vader: Most certainly they are usable
[04:07] <[TL] Smokey> hey
[04:07] <wastrel> QUEEN:  are you using gnome?
[04:08] <vader> QUEEN, sorry I have been working on these othersystems, like wastrel has asked you 2x are you using GNOME or KDE or what desktop
[04:09] <DevC> AnthonyG: if your ISP didn't tell you about the DNS they may have forgot but if they use Static DNS numbers and you picked Dynamic that would still give you that there is no connection....you need to call you ISP provider and find out if they have use static DNS and if so they need to give you the DNS for a 56k modem
[04:09] <tx22> Any linux mint fans in the house tonight?

[04:14] <eighty_> foo.com has ubuntu server with openssh-server and ssh installed
[04:14] <eighty_> foo.com can ping bar.com
[04:14] <QUEEN> i might not be so upset but every since i started posting on the forum i have some idiot reposting and picking apart everything i say on the forums on usenet
[04:14] <eighty_> but bar.com can't ping foo.com or ssh in
[04:14] <eighty_> thoughts?
[04:15] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: do you have a terminal accessable?
[04:15] <vader> np QUEEN I am on your side, support is supposed to be here to be had, I will do what I can :)
[04:15] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yup
[04:15] <Pelo> queen searching the ubuntu forum for a similar problem would have been the first thing to do ,  more often then not you donT' need to post
[04:15] <Terminus> eighty_: foo.com is behind a firewall that blocks ICMP? also, the firewall might be blocking port 22 for ssh or is behind a NAT with no forwarding setup.
[04:16] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: what happens when you type gdm
[04:16] <DevC> My life is ruined because of Ubuntu! My wife left me because I paid more attention to it than her! Nothing can replace the tingling sensation when kissing the monitor or the pain of making her mad when you kiss her disc drive wrong!
[04:16] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: nothing
[04:16] <eighty_> terminus... thanks... are these issues that need to be resolved on foo.com, or the network?
[04:16] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: did you already modify your xorg.conf?
=== mheath[laptop] _ is now known as mheath[laptop] 
[04:17] <Terminus> eighty_: either at the firewall or the NAT. the person who setup the network would know. or if you know whether you have a firewall or NAT, that'd help too. =)
[04:17] <Terminus> eighty_: the firewall might be on foo.com itself.
[04:17] <eighty_> heh, thanks terminus! :)
[04:17] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yup
[04:17] <wastrel> i used mencoder to rotate my avi file <3
[04:17] <eighty_> how to check?
[04:17] <eighty_> hosts.allow allows ALL
[04:17] <vader> QUEEN, does it read a regular disk right?
[04:17] <eighty_> would that be an iptables thing?
[04:18] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: sudo killall gdm && sudo gdm
[04:18] <QUEEN> vader it reads a regualr disk just fine
[04:18] <Terminus> eighty_: yes, it'd be an iptables thing.
[04:18] <superchode|fu> nvidia supplies their linux nforce drivers in .rpm or .tar.gz... what's the best way to install on ubuntu?
[04:18] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: so out of curiosity - did the xorg.conf have "vesa" or "ati"?
[04:18] <eighty_> heh... quick reminder how to check that please? :)
[04:18] <kurisutofuaa> ati
[04:18] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: ati
[04:18] <eighty_> googling now... :)\
[04:19] <trilliji> Does anyone know if the beta nvidia drivers that were on amaranth.selfip.com have been released of if there is an alternate location to get nvidia drivers?
[04:19] <TheDebugger> superchode|fu: It's written in the docs on the website, nvidia-glx...
[04:19] <vader> QUEEN, I have almost allways used Memorex but Sony I have had this problem before. Try a dollar store memorex disk
[04:19] <Amaranth> !nvidia9 | trilliji
[04:19] <ubotu> trilliji: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[04:19] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: hm, that's interesting behavior.  Anyhow, did gdm restart?
[04:19] <Terminus> eighty_: sudo iptables -L i think.
[04:19] <superchode|fu> TheDebugger: not video drivers... sound
[04:19] <eighty_> ah, thanks...
[04:19] <QUEEN> vader that was one of the brands I tried
[04:19] <superchode|fu> ie. ubuntu isn't directly supported
[04:19] <vader> Sorry for not being much help QUEEN but this is an odd one
[04:20] <benevolentparty> whoa
[04:20] <vader> QUEEN, hmmmmmmmmm
[04:20] <vader> stay with me, my brain will catch up
[04:20] <dsnyders> What is a good tool for recovering data from a drive when the superblocks are corrupt?
[04:20] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yes then it went to a black screen and I hread form my speakers the startup sound but no display
[04:21] <w30> dsnyders, are all the superblocks bad?
[04:21] <QUEEN> vader it is OK I am gonna go offline for good I am too stupid to have a pc or live
[04:21] <vader> QUEEN, it detects them as either CD-RW or as what?
[04:22] <QUEEN> i mean hell the things i posted on the forum got reposted on usenet and picked apart
[04:22] <vader> no one is too stupid QUEEN
[04:22] <QUEEN> it either does not read them at all and when i force them in and out about 20 times it mistakes it for a cd rw
[04:22] <vader> QUEEN, this is not there, and I am willing to try
[04:22] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: so this is further than you have gotten thus far, correct?
[04:22] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yup
[04:23] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: what resolution do you run on your monitor under normal conditions?
[04:23] <dsnyders> w30, fsck gives me errors on all the ones I've tried.
[04:23] <kurisutofuaa> 1280/1024
[04:23] <QUEEN> thanx vader
[04:23] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: 1280/1024
[04:23] <vader> ok, QUEEN what I would honestly do is try another distro's love CD or windows and see if it does it with that. Please just understand I am trying to get you on with enjoying Ubuntu
[04:23] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: you feeling patient right now?
[04:24] <vader> love=live
[04:24] <craigbas1976> I'm trying to run ardour, but get a message about jack.  First time I've had a computer tell me I don't know jack, but anyway...  How do I start jack?  There's a jackd right?  Not in /etc/init.d
[04:24] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yeah
[04:24] <QUEEN> veder i cant try anonter distro and dont have my xp disk and if i dont back some stuff up tonight my life is ruined
[04:24] <w30> dsnyders, that's been my experience with alternate superblocks also, if one is bad they are all bad :=(
[04:24] <john64> I am having my X Server using 30%+ Cpu on multiple fresh installations of Edgy
[04:25] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: if so reboot - press the F6 replace splash with vga=792 xforcevesa...edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf "ati" to "vesa" if it isn't already
[04:25] <vader> does anyone else have any suggestions for QUEEN ?
[04:25] <QUEEN> no ppl cant even seem to get that it wont read a blank CD
[04:25] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: I will do that now.
[04:25] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: ...and then you may need to restart gdm (if you had to modify xorg.conf then it will be a must)
[04:25] <dsnyders> w30, I tried e2retrieve, but all it does is spit out 3 files.  I can find no docs on what to do with those files.
[04:26] <vader> ok, then QUEEN what does it say when you try to burn a CD
[04:26] <nekobaka> !irc
[04:26] <ubotu> irc is Internet Relay Chat - Ubuntu IRC clients: xchat (http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/XChatHowto), gaim (http://help.ubuntu.com/community/GaimHowto), Konversation (http://konversation.berlios.de/docs/) - Also see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat and !guidelines
[04:26] <QUEEN> it tells me to insert a blank CD it does not read that i have inserted one
[04:26] <vader> it may just be seeing something wierd
[04:26] <vader> ok
[04:26] <vader> then I would say that the burner is pooched
[04:27] <john64> does anyone have any ideas about my X Server using insane amounts of CPU?
[04:27] <arathald> I'm having trouble installing the ATI firegl drivers -- when i run dmesg it gives me "[17179609.796000]  [fglrx:firegl_unlock]  *ERROR* Process 4327 using kernel context 0" (PID 4327 is Xorg) -- can anyone help me out here? I've been working for hours and I can't figure this out.
[04:27] <w30> dsnyders, I could have said try an alternate superblock but that the only thing that I know to do. Maybe hit Google for ext3 or ext2 file corruption search. Sorry I am so dumb.
[04:27] <craigbas1976> What is jack anyway?
[04:28] <davey486> I need help with my wifi card, I have a belin f5d7000 chipset rt2500, i have been reading in the forums for 3 days and can't seem to figure it out
[04:28] <zspada15> !google | davey486
[04:28] <ubotu> davey486: Google is a very popular search engine: http://www.google.com  -  Google also has a Linux-specific search engine: http://google.com/linux
[04:28] <QUEEN> if i dont figure out something and if ppl dont stop asking me the same thing over and over on the forum im hurting myself ppl r now making fun on the forum
[04:28] <vader> QUEEN, if you lived in Canada I would send you another on for free
[04:28] <w30> dsnyders, any think in the Lost and found directory?
[04:29] <bitflip> davey486: what problem exactly?
[04:29] <QUEEN> vader i dont mean to freak out about this
[04:29] <dsnyders> w30, stand by...
[04:29] <vader> I know QUEEN
[04:31] <vader> QUEEN, when I have had them go bad before, they  would read a CD and not see a blank cd, so that is the reason for me syaing that I would belive it has gone dead on you
[04:31] <dsnyders> w30, none of the lost and found folders contain any data.
[04:31] <keeb`away> hey there
[04:31] <keeb`away> i have a quick question
[04:31] <davey486> bitflip, i nstalled ndiswrapper and got the drivers off of the cd, but it just shows it as being present but my network doesn't work after i disable my on board ethernet from the bios
[04:31] <nikin> keeb: and that would be?
[04:32] <keeb`away> sudo aticonfig --initial=dual-head --screen-layout=above
[04:32] <keeb`away> that works perfectly,
[04:32] <keeb`away> but i want the monitor to be LEFT
[04:32] <keeb`away> but --screen-layout=left doesnt appear to cut it
[04:32] <w30> dsnyders, darn if I know maybe Google Lost and Found directory will give you some hint of where to go?
[04:32] <nikin> davey: is there a wep key on the network? or WPA?
[04:32] <QUEEN> vader if thats the case I will replace it tomorrow no big deal, im upset over a lot more than my cd burner
[04:32] <davey486> wep
[04:32] <john64> why would an X Server be using a constant 30% of my cpu?
[04:33] <vader> QUEEN, try it, I honestly think that is the problem :)
[04:33] <vader> bbl
[04:33] <QUEEN> vader can I privately message u?
[04:33] <davey486> IIn the "newtworking" , it has a field for password. is that the key?
[04:33] <vader> one sec QUEEN
[04:33] <QUEEN> ok
=== vader is now known as vader1102
[04:33] <wastrel> QUEEN:  try using gnomebaker which doesn't need to "mount" the blank cd
[04:33] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Had to modify the xorg.conf now am about to restart gdm
[04:33] <QUEEN> i will try that
[04:33] <dsnyders> w30, any other recovery tools you could suggest?
[04:34] <vader1102> ok, go for it QUEEN
[04:34] <w30> dsnyders, I can't help you there.
[04:34] <nikin> keeb: its LeftOf
[04:34] <nikin> if i recal it good
[04:34] <w30> dsnyders, sorry
[04:35] <john64> anyone? or am i a leper
[04:35] <H3g3m0n> http://www.winehq.com/ <- Down for anyone else?
[04:35] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: it went to a black screen again and I heard form my speakers the startup sound but no display still
[04:35] <trilliji> Has anyone had much luck lately with banshee?
[04:35] <dsnyders> w30, that doesn't surprise me.  I've been googling for most of the week, and asking in half a dozen irc channels.  No joy.
[04:35] <vader1102> QUEEN, I have to go, I will be back in 1.5 hours or so
[04:36] <john64> winehq seems to be down for me too
[04:36] <dsnyders> Thanks for the help anyways, w30
[04:36] <QUEEN> ok take care and thanks for your help
[04:36] <nikin> trilliji: did you get my message?
[04:36] <trilliji> nikin: Yes, thanks
[04:36] <nikin> it helped?
[04:36] <dsnyders> Perhaps someone knows a way to send a message to me back in the past to make a backup?
[04:36] <fjf314> No luck on my earlier problem with X, guys.
[04:37] <ikaruga> hi guys how do I load a module at boot time?
[04:37] <nikin> snyders: try man cron
[04:37] <trilliji> nikin: Anyone have any ideas for getting automount to work again. Went to  gnome-volume-properties, and I have mount removable drives when hot plugged checked, mount removable media when inserted checked, and browse removable media when inserted checked
[04:37] <fjf314> After using the command you gave, going through all of the menus, and then using the "startx" command, it gave me a "Connection reset by peer" error and did nothing.
[04:37] <john64> i have an S3 SuperSavageIXC and right after a clean install, it is using 30%+ cpu all the time.  I haven't done a single thing, this happens on multiple installations
[04:37] <fjf314> Any ideas?
[04:37] <trilliji> nikin: They are checked, but not working it appears
[04:38] <w30> dsnyders, have you called any hard drive repair stores or services like a business supply outfit that maybe could put you on track. They have customers that have really valuable data that can't afford to be lost.
[04:38] <Spant[AT] DH> I'm in a hurry. I need help adding a custommade font in Ubuntu Dapper drake serverinstall with Xubuntudesktop running Fluxbox.
[04:38] <brianski> is the ubuntu splash screen supposed to be greyscale on amd64 ?
[04:38] <davey486> where do i put in  my wep key and my essid
[04:39] <john64> that happens for me too brianski
[04:39] <brianski> john64: weird
[04:39] <john64> i thought os
[04:39] <nikin> trilliji: then i ame out of ideas... but will think about it, but its 4:38AM so i go and sleep, have a nice day :D
[04:39] <john64> i much rather the color one
[04:39] <brianski> i also noticed that when booting to the install disk, it was not only grey, but the right half of it slightly corrupted
[04:39] <asjha> hello
[04:39] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: do you still have the box up?  (minus a working X)
[04:39] <trilliji> nikin: thanks, you too
[04:39] <brianski> the bar where the progress meter goes was solid on the left, weird
[04:39] <john64> for me (X1800XT) the entire non-x portion of ubuntu is messed
[04:40] <john64> i can't see anything on my TTY's
[04:40] <dsnyders> w30, I'll consider that option.
[04:40] <brianski> hmm my ttys seem ok
[04:40] <john64> what video?
[04:40] <w30> dsnyders, I have talked to a hard drive manufacturer when I had a disk fail under warranty and they have ways of recovery that probably cost you an arm and a leg but maybe they would at least talk to you free.
[04:40] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: I will have to restart it
[04:40] <arathald> so can anyone help me out with ATI drivers?
[04:40] <brianski> and shockingly my ethernet, sound, and wifi (all of which need custom compiles, one of which needs its own firmware) all work with 64 bit
[04:40] <john64> awesome!
[04:40] <bitflip> arathald: what ati card?
[04:41] <john64> Does anyone have any ideas regarding XOrg insane CPU usage?
[04:41] <kevinG_> anyone have an idea on why my sound doesn't work when i log in sometimes?
[04:41] <john64> i really have no idea why my X Server is using 30% of my CPU, and it makes the computer unusable
[04:41] <john64> winehq is up again
[04:42] <arathald> bitflip: firegl V5200 (its more or less a rebranded radeon mobility)
[04:42] <john64> what core?
[04:43] <john64> R200, R300, R400?
[04:43] <asjha> I have quick question:  I did a Dapper Sever install, added xwin and xfce.  What do I need to install to get gksudo or something like that for running gui apps as root?
[04:43] <brianski> john64: are you running firefox in 64 bit mode?
[04:43] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Okay I restarted it what do you want me to do now?
[04:44] <brianski> i thought there was a way to run the 32bit firefox, which should be a lot easier to get flash and java etc. working with
[04:44] <john64> brianski: i don't bother with 64bit, it is a lot of headaches for 0 performance improvment
[04:44] <brianski> but apt-cache search firefox | grep 32 gives me nada
[04:44] <rbrunhuber> i can not go in the internet if i have a search directive in my resolv.conf
[04:44] <john64> also, closed plugins will only work in 32bit mode
[04:44] <bitflip> arathald: have you followed this guide step by step?  http://tinyurl.com/yc6mal
[04:44] <rbrunhuber> does anybody know such problems?
[04:44] <brianski> john64: right, so where do i get the 32 bit firefox?
[04:44] <john64> try using linux32
[04:45] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: you have your xorg modified and all that, correct?
[04:45] <john64> install the linux32 package and try to run "linux32 firefox"
[04:45] <arathald> bitflip: yes, I have -- I went though several of them at least a few times each
[04:45] <john64> i don't know otherwise, i really don't use or care about AMD64
[04:46] <brianski> john64: oh i thought you said you were on amd64
[04:46] <brianski> and hyour name also implied that :)
[04:46] <john64> no, i have used it enough to know i don't care for it
[04:46] <john64> it is the same except that you cannot load 32 bit libraries properly in Ubuntu
[04:46] <john64> it is a real hassle and waste of time
[04:46] <brianski> john64: you can't ?
[04:47] <DevC> well I'm out I hope AnthonyG doesn't have any other problems ....if so I'll have to help him later cause I'm off to bed
[04:47] <brianski> if you have 32 bit application and 32 bit library, that should work, no?
[04:47] <john64> last time i heard, ubuntu has really poor 64bit support,  that should work
[04:47] <davey486> is it a problem that my wireless card gets installed to ra0 instead of wkan0?
[04:47] <john64> does it work davey486?
[04:47] <davey486> wkan0=wlan0
[04:47] <Gog123> join #ubuntu-offtopic
[04:48] <davey486> i see it, but can't use it
[04:48] <john64> what kind of card is it?
[04:48] <davey486> belkin f5d7000 chipset rt2500
[04:48] <arathald> bitflip: It's staying on the Mesa driver
[04:49] <john64> is the module loaded?
[04:50] <brianski> wtf
[04:50] <brianski> how does linux32 work?
[04:50] <brianski> it can just turn any 64 bit executable into a 32 bit one???
[04:50] <john64> no
[04:50] <php-freak> [root@bigboy tmp] # useradd -g users www now whats the []  brackets for in this syntax, whats that sussposed to mean, I know usually you don't put them in either, it just like a paramenter, but what is the # sign for, whats that reprsenting?
[04:51] <wastrel> ok bye now
[04:51] <john64> it won't turn a 64 bit executable into 32
[04:51] <john64> it will just run an executable in a 32bit environment
[04:51] <cadu> hello! yahoo, how to update from dapper to edgy !?
[04:51] <arathald> php-freak: the pount sign (#) means that is a root user logged into the console
[04:52] <bitflip> arathald: /etc/X11/xorg.conf contains "fglrx" and "Composite" "Disable"
[04:52] <arathald> php-fream: you need to run it as root or using sudo
[04:52] <arathald> bitflip: yes
[04:52] <brianski> john64: know where i can read more about the magic that makes linux32 work?
[04:52] <john64> run uname -m then run "linux32 uname -m"
[04:52] <brianski> the manpage isn't helping me :)
[04:52] <arathald> php-freak: you need to run it as root or using sudo
[04:53] <php-freak> okay what about the brackets?
[04:53] <bitflip> arathald: and to be thorough - /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules contains "fglrx"?
[04:53] <john64> i don't have an AMD64 os installed right now, so i don't know what to say, but all it does is tell the executable that it is running in a 32bit environment, and i beleive it execs the file like a 32bit one
[04:53] <php-freak> so basicay just replace # with sudo
[04:53] <davey486> is the wep key a 26 character string?
[04:54] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Okay mod'ed the xorg.conf
[04:54] <michaelaoash> My wireless stopped working after I installed the current batch of updates (edgy eft)
[04:54] <davey486> I type a passphrase into windows when i installed my card and it spit out a 26 character string, is that the key?
[04:54] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: but haven't killed gdm and restarted it yet
[04:55] <php-freak> any one know how I can restart apache on linux?
[04:55] <kurisutofuaa> cl
[04:55] <fjf314> I really need some help with installating Ubuntu.
[04:55] <arathald> bitflip: the linux-restricted-modules is to disable modules -- a module being absent from the file means its enabled
[04:55] <craigbas1976> php-freak, might be /etc/init.d/httpd restart
[04:55] <arathald> fjf314: how can I help?
[04:55] <craigbas1976> php-freak, but don't quote me on that
[04:55] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: sudo killall gdm && startx && export DISPLAY=:0 && xterm
[04:55] <john64> does anyone have any ideas regarding an X server causing a machine to become very laggy?
[04:55] <michaelaoash> To restart apache, try /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
[04:55] <bitflip> arathald: what version driver are you using?
[04:56] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: trying now
[04:56] <michaelaoash> I would like some help with my wireless connection please
[04:56] <fjf314> I'm getting the error that says, "Failed to start the X server... blah blah."  So I get to the command line and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[04:56] <fjf314> I go through all of the menus.
[04:56] <craigbas1976> john64, Are you using the right driver?  I had a crazy slow box until I stopped using the vesa one.
[04:56] <fjf314> Then, when I get back to the command line, I type "startx" to try to re-start the installation.
[04:56] <arathald> bitflip: 8.29.6
[04:56] <craigbas1976> john64, well, the box wasn't slow, but X was
[04:56] <fjf314> All it does, though, is give me another error about "Connection reset by peer."
[04:56] <john64> lemme check, i am pretty sure it is working, OpenGL is running fine
[04:57] <fjf314> I can't seem to get any further than this.
[04:57] <php-freak> craigbas1976: I'm king of confused, but what does bash mean?
[04:57] <john64> craigbas1976: I am running the correct savage driver
[04:57] <bitflip> arathald: have you at any time used apt-get to install *fglrx*?
[04:57] <michaelaoash> "bash" is the shell; you can type commands into a terminal.
[04:57] <craigbas1976> php-freak, What?  Are you serious? bash is the shell most linux users use.  Like the dos prompt.
[04:58] <fjf314> Anyone have some ideas?
[04:58] <php-freak> I see thats all it means
[04:58] <arathald> bitflip: uhh... I think I did. why, should I not have?
[04:58] <hicks> k fjf
[04:58] <michaelaoash> fjf314: please specify the problem again.
[04:58] <LNXempire> hi peoplz
[04:58] <hicks> type sudo nano /etc/X11
[04:58] <blameless> i haven't used bash in years
[04:58] <craigbas1976> john64, then you have reached the extent of my abilities... Sorry.
[04:58] <fjf314>  I'm getting the error that says, "Failed to start the X server... blah blah."  So I get to the command line and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[04:58] <fjf314> I go through all of the menus.
[04:58] <john64> craigbas1976: thanks anyway!
[04:58] <hicks> it should tell you a command dpkg -reconfigure in the file
[04:58] <john64> i never thought to check that btw
[04:58] <fjf314> Then, when I get back to the command line, I type "startx" to try to re-start the installation.
[04:59] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: It gave me the start up sound but still no display
[04:59] <craigbas1976> blameless, what do you use?  A friend was raving about zsh a couple of months ago
[04:59] <LNXempire> is it possible to have transfer music from Rythmbox to a mp3 player?
[04:59] <hicks> tell the whole command as shown
[04:59] <blameless> i use zsh
[04:59] <hicks> type*
[04:59] <john64> what is good about zsh
[04:59] <john64> i <3 bash
[04:59] <blameless> the tab completion works better
[04:59] <fjf314> Which command?
[04:59] <LNXempire> craigbas1976: lol@raving... yeah I wonder why zhs is better
[04:59] <john64> (that is an honest question btw, it sounds fanboish though)
[04:59] <arathald> bitflip: method 1 on the page you gave me says to use ap-get for xorg-driver-fglrx -- i assume this is the same thing
[04:59] <hicks> its in the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:59] <john64> how is it better, like an example?
[04:59] <QUEEN> all unless sumone helps me in the next bit so I can actually get my cd burner to see i am inserting a bank CD I am fully prepared to hang myself
[04:59] <jrib> john64: completion, more globbing options are my favorite features
[04:59] <LNXempire> anyways please is it possible to dl music using rythmbox?
[05:00] <hicks> it dpkg -reconfigure... forget the rest
[05:00] <craigbas1976> LNXempire, I have no idea; I never tried it out.
[05:00] <blameless> it has more options, better globbing, and the completion works faster
[05:00] <bitflip> arathald: follow method 2 step by step and do *everything* it says
[05:00] <QUEEN> my life has totally been ruined by switching to linux
[05:00] <fjf314> Would that make a difference, though?  Using the command I gave you, I was able to go through all of the menus to reconfigure it.
[05:00] <john64> LNXempire: you don't really download music in rhythmbox, unless you are talking about iTunes Music Store
[05:00] <arathald> bitflip: alright, be back in a few
[05:00] <Skwid_> nice ! i just figured out that my multimedia key worked :D
[05:00] <LNXempire> craigbas1976: this is insane, mp3 player are as popular as Britney Spears
[05:00] <QUEEN> hello?
[05:00] <php-freak>  this is bull
[05:00] <bitflip> arathald: I'll assist (if I can) but out of 4 people in the last 24 hours, nobody has come back for help and said it works
[05:01] <Skwid_> this is awesome :D
[05:01] <Skwid_> i loveeeee ubuntuuuuu
[05:01] <php-freak> I keep trying to restart apache, and its not letting me
[05:01] <QUEEN> im begging one of u to help me
[05:01] <zeeeeee> hi all, is there a way to do advanced print manipulation (eg concatenating, n-up, scaling, etc.) reliably (i.e. without relying on postscript)? over many years/boxes/trails, i've found that PS manipulation tools like psutils almost never work for me (or the output is poor). i ultimately fall back to windows where i end up using freeware or MS Document Imaging.
[05:01] <php-freak> says command not valid
[05:01] <LNXempire> john64: no, I am saying transfer music from Rythmbox to an Mp3 player
[05:01] <craigbas1976> LNXempire, he was raving about Ubuntu a couple weeks ago.  I had already tried it and bailed after a couple weeks, but I'm trying it again
[05:01] <php-freak> jrib: do you know how to restart apache?
[05:01] <LNXempire> that's what i mean
[05:01] <hicks> i think it would use the vesa driver until you download 3d drivers
[05:01] <asjha> is there an equivalent to gksudo that can be installed on a Dapper Server installtion that has had x and xfce added with apt-get?
[05:01] <QUEEN> and if someone does not help me fix this i am gonna end my life over this shit
[05:01] <john64> oh, ok
[05:01] <crimsun> QUEEN: a bit drastic, no?
[05:01] <hicks> lol queen whats wrong?
[05:01] <fjf314> Well, whatever it does it's not working, haha.
[05:01] <QUEEN> listen dont lol
[05:01] <fjf314> And I really don't know what else to try.
[05:01] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: hell, I'm running out of ideas.  Give me a few moments to google something real quick
[05:02] <jrib> php-freak: sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 restart
[05:02] <fjf314> I can't really find anything via Google.
[05:02] <QUEEN> and kmy damn cd burned cant see that I have inserted a blank CD
[05:02] <hicks> lol fjf314 read "/etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:02] <LNXempire> ok so noone here uses an mp3 player?
[05:02] <cadu> --> /etc/init.d/apache restart
[05:02] <michaelaoash> fjf314: what's the hardware?
[05:02] <php-freak> its local apache
[05:02] <jrib> php-freak: what does that mean?
[05:02] <crimsun> LNXempire: em pee three? ...Wot's that?
[05:02] <php-freak> not on my server
[05:02] <php-freak> on my local pc
[05:02] <fjf314> My video card, which I'm assuming is the issue since it's video related, is an ATI X600.
[05:02] <jrib> php-freak: yes, the command I gave you will restart apache
[05:03] <BlackTopBum> Where can I post problems but maybe they're not bugs for XCFE4  ?
[05:03] <php-freak> wahts invoke-rc.d?
[05:03] <hicks> k fjf314 ill get you the link for installing the ati drivers
[05:03] <john64> wiki.cchtml.com
[05:03] <w30> crimsun, start em pee three with the dir key
[05:03] <php-freak> nice it restarted
[05:03] <hicks> so you dont have to listen to my bad instructions
[05:03] <jrib> php-freak: basicallyit's the same as doing  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
[05:03] <php-freak> jrib: how'd you find tat command out
[05:03] <john64> that is the best guide that i have come across for installing ati drivers (wiki.cchtml.com
[05:03] <fjf314> I know where the ATI drivers are, but what good will they do if I can't install the OS?
[05:03] <QUEEN> hello?
[05:03] <LNXempire> crimsun: you know a is portable audio device that stores music on flash drive
[05:04] <php-freak> I tried that one, and it didn't not work, well i tried sudo /etc/apache2/httpd.conf restart
[05:04] <brentLinux> Hey all. Could anyone here help out a total newb with some sound issues?
[05:04] <hicks> lol queen i did not understand what you said about the burnt cd
[05:04] <michaelaoash> fjf314: sorry, this is a hard problem.  you may want to visit a Linux Users' Group in your area. hands on assistance often helps.
[05:04] <QUEEN> fine I am gonna fucking hang myself if someone does not fucking offer to help me right nep
[05:04] <QUEEN> now
[05:04] <hicks> its a easy problem
[05:04] <jrib> !language | QUEEN
[05:04] <ubotu> QUEEN: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[05:04] <hicks> i have a ati x700 with the same problem
[05:04] <kevinG_> QUEEN, nobody is being paid to help here.
[05:04] <crimsun> QUEEN: dramawhoring leads to suffering.
[05:04] <BlackTopBum> brentLinux: what probs?
[05:04] <fjf314> I mean, I've gone to the ATI website and looked at the drivers so I know where they are once I get it installed, but getting it installed is giving me the trouble, hehe.
[05:04] <cadu> QUEEN: do us a favor, hang yourself :~) you aren't paying my bills, are you?
[05:04] <php-freak> man this is pissin me off been here for like 3 hours trying to figure out how to set up my apache directories, where to read the files from, and its not working, or I don't know how to do it??
[05:05] <hicks> dont use ati website drivers
[05:05] <hicks> they suck
[05:05] <LNXempire> QUEEN: go ahead hang yourself, do you have a webcam so we can watch the show?
[05:05] <cadu> so you can't order anyone to help you
[05:05] <john64> they dont
[05:05] <DanSchnell> cadu: Don't encourage suicide, thats just wrong mate
[05:05] <brentLinux> I was trying to install Ardour, and while installing Alsa/Jack, I ended up causing my sound to quit working.
[05:05] <QUEEN> I could care less  and if one of u dont ofer and give me the correct way to fix this I got no choice
[05:05] <john64> they work excellent
[05:05] <hicks> use the fgrlx drivers
[05:05] <fjf314> Haha, alright, that saved me one future problem.
[05:05] <jrib> php-freak: I'm not really sure how I first learned about it.  typing 'man invoke-rc.d' should help
[05:05] <elkbuntu> cadu, LNXempire that is uncalled for.
[05:05] <brentLinux> I've done searches and things for it, but I haven't found anything that's haelped.
[05:05] <hicks> http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Dapper_Installation_Guide the link for a ati driver guide
[05:05] <brentLinux> So I guess I might need help reinstallng ALSA, primarily.
[05:05] <LNXempire> QUEEN: relax, what's the issue to begin with?
[05:05] <Toma-> QUEEN: a linux problem < life problems. get help
[05:05] <zeeeeee> *trials
[05:05] <hicks> lol
[05:05] <pagefault> ati is a nightmare in linux
[05:05] <michaelaoash> may i get some help with making wireless work.  It was working fine and stopped after my most recent update with the update-manager.  wired connection works fine, wireless "sees" the networks but can't connect.
[05:05] <john64> QUEEN: goto http://wiki.cchtml.com as i suggested before
[05:05] <BlackTopBum> brentLinux: sorry,can't help you
[05:05] <hicks> yea ati sucks in linux even after the drivers are installed
[05:06] <john64> hicks: i beg to differ
[05:06] <brentLinux> Alright, thanks for the offer. :)
[05:06] <khel> Anyone know where to set DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS when logging in remotely via XDMCP? Seems like dbus-lanuch is start fine but not setting the variable (which seems to be messing with gnome)
[05:06] <cadu> elkbuntu: sorry, just thought it was extremely uncouth to order people to help you.... like we're made to serve, thought we are here to help each other and collaborate ;)
[05:06] <pagefault> I switched to nvidia from ati
[05:06] <pagefault> I can't believe how different it is
[05:06] <hicks> beg to differ what?
[05:06] <elkbuntu> cadu, it happens all the time. we dont encourage suicide out of spite though.
[05:06] <john64> that ATI Drivers in linux are perfectly fine
[05:06] <QUEEN> I have tried that and for the reco9rd for the ass who wats to watch me end my life I do got a cam and wilol do it on cam unlesws one of u tells me right now how to fix this
[05:06] <michaelaoash> fjf314 and others: may i suggest installing the proprietary drivers (this helped for my nVidia card).
[05:06] <hicks> meh i get much worse frames on linux in ut2003 then in windows
[05:06] <pagefault> perfectly fine if you enjoy that your product gets 30% of it's real performance
[05:06] <hicks> my nvidia was the opposite
[05:07] <winbond> does anyone got the flash9 working in 6.10 x64?
[05:07] <hicks> i dont mind the ati drivers just saying they could be a lot better
[05:07] <john64> winbond: no, and it isn't possible
[05:07] <cadu> elkbuntu: okays, got it ;) anyone, people really *do* it when encouraged? ttssss sucks ;~)
[05:07] <hicks> lol
[05:07] <fjf314> hicks: So will this work just from the command prompt before the system is installed?
[05:07] <elkbuntu> QUEEN, please stop the attitude before i remove you from here. emotional blackmail is very unwelcome.
[05:07] <Toma-> QUEEN: what is the problem anyway?
[05:07] <DanSchnell> What do you think I can do with...1.8 GB, and ~500MHz on my computer?  I don't know what to do
[05:07] <hicks> yea
[05:07] <michaelaoash> any tips on my newly developed wireless problem?
[05:07] <winbond> john64: whats wrong with it?
[05:07] <john64> toma: Queen can't read documentation
[05:07] <fjf314> Awesome, you're a lifesaver.
[05:07] <arathald> bitflip: yeah, i know, ATI drivers are a pain
[05:07] <DanSchnell> Toma-, He's emotionally unstable
[05:07] <w30> php-freak, sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

[05:07] <LNXempire> i am going to join QUEEN and suicide if someone doesn't help how to transfer music from Rythmbox to a mp3 player
[05:07] <fjf314> I'm going to reboot the CD and give it a try.  Thanks for all the help, I really appreciate it!
[05:07] <john64> winbond, it is complicated, just accept it, it is easier
[05:08] <QUEEN> aned u saty one morew rude thing i will end my life im sick of this
[05:08] <john64> QUEEN: did you follow it?

[05:08] <hicks> install g++
[05:08] <cadu> elkbuntu: coz i live in japan, and yesterday a japanese came with a sad face at me (the guys with the cold-heart fame) and said "have nothing worth living"
[05:08] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: yes - you should be able to get going with that
[05:08] <pagefault> dobsonj: if you grab the svn image it will fix that problem
[05:08] <winbond> john64: how do i get flash to work than?
[05:08] <hicks> sudo apt-get install g++ in bash dobsonj
[05:08] <john64> winbond: Don't use AMD64
[05:08] <cadu> elkbuntu: then i said "why are you living then?" :))
[05:08] <hicks> or nvm
[05:08] <jrib> dobsonj: no need to compile.  zsnes is in the repos
[05:08] <jrib> !info zsnes | dobsonj
[05:08] <john64> that was my solution and it is fine, 32bit is no slower

[05:09] <jrib> ubotu: tell dobsonj about multiverse
[05:09] <elkbuntu> QUEEN, please behave this time.
[05:09] <dobsonj> jrib, i want to apply a patch, but thanks :)

[05:13] <pschulz01> _greenie: Did you see this.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=284220
[05:13] <cadu> DanSchnell: i used debian coz i could install the very much BASE system (200mb) and with dselect slowly add the other packages....with a 500mb install you get yourself a basic system with no frills and a simple X.... like Xorg + ICEWM or XFCE
[05:13] <timthelion> _greenie: have you looked in aslamixer?
[05:13] <superchode|fu> from ubuntu forums: ctually, Macromedia Flash can be installed under AMD64 together with 32-bit Opera 9 (provided that you install the "Other/Static DEB" package from the Opera download site). This works because this software doesn't use system libraries, and because AMD64 processors have a 32-bit compatibility mode.
[05:13] <timthelion> _greenie: is everything set right?
[05:13] <php-freak> now when i comment out something i just use ;; right?
[05:13] <cadu> DanSchnell: and with this pentium 166 i did all my coding\gaming (emulators/nethack) and stuff
[05:14] <john64> the only problem is that the average person really doesn't make use of the 64bit features, to the point where it is faster or better than 32bit
[05:14] <john64> it just causes problems
[05:14] <timthelion> john64: send me $850 and I will ;)
[05:14] <hicks> john64 is trully correct
[05:14] <cadu> john64: i have a Athlon 64 X2 and thanks to that, i *prefer* to use a 32bit userland and 32bit smp kernel :)
[05:15] <john64> i <3 32bit
[05:15] <hicks> :D
[05:15] <john64> it is really so simple!
[05:15] <php-freak> after editing the xorg.conf do I have to restart anything?
[05:15] <winbond> john64: ohh  , i remember , swiftfox is a modded version of firefoz that can use 32bit plugins under x64 os
[05:15] <_greenie> tried this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=284220 but that didnt work
[05:15] <john64> timthelion: Send me the thing, and i will get right on the $850 :P
[05:15] <cadu> 64bit is still buggy and largely unsupported, compilers haven't reaaaaally matured...whatever
[05:15] <asjha> hicks: yeah, it's fast enough for web browsing, email, and print server duties.  i don't do any multimedia on it, however.
[05:15] <DanSchnell> cadu, Which kind of emulators?
[05:15] <pagefault> 64-bit runs fine for me
[05:15] <pagefault> I use it in server environments
[05:16] <blameless> i've also never had a problem with 64-bit on my desktop
[05:16] <john64> pagefault: server
[05:16] <pagefault> and desktop
[05:16] <john64> s are a completely diferent game
[05:16] <DanSchnell> Toma-: Well, I was thinking about using wine and wow, but I dont have a big enough HDD
[05:16] <hicks> ahh i wanted my pentium to play quake :(
[05:16] <cadu> DanSchnell: at that time with this sucky machine i could use ZSNES perfectly....nethack.....quake....doom2
[05:16] <Toma-> DanSchnell: i doubt you'd run WoW on a 500mhz machine
[05:16] <pagefault> as long as you bootstrap a 32-bit install and set up your paths it works great
[05:16] <pagefault> the only annoyance is two apt gets
[05:16] <timthelion> is it possible to make it so that a pdf that gets put in a certain directory gets prited?
[05:17] <timthelion> _greenie: alsamixer sorry
[05:17] <john64> winbond: Swiftfox is a static build, so it too doesn't use the system libraries
[05:17] <john64> but 64bit really isn't worth the headaches
[05:17] <DanSchnell> Toma-: I can wish i could :D
[05:17] <asjha> also, i did a server installation and added x and xfce on my owm, so it's tiny :)
[05:17] <john64> magically my X server seems to be working better
[05:17] <Toma-> DanSchnell: you could run starcraft on it?
[05:17] <dredhammer> hello i'm trying to compile the latest mplayer from svn nd i keep getting this error  about libmpdemux and deumx.mov.o when i do make
[05:17] <pschulz01> _greenie: One suggestion from http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/forum/showthread.php?t=286
[05:18] <hicks> lol yea i love linux for the easy server administration and install
[05:18] <dredhammer> i'm using dapper
[05:18] <pagefault> but I could agree that unless you are a developer then 64-bit is sort of pointless for you
[05:18] <cadu> btw, have a question myself, my wife is sick of me talking about linux coz she wanna use the "cutey" windows MSN messenger... ;~
[05:18] <DanSchnell> Toma-: There's an idea.. I was gonna put some music on it, but easyubuntu isn't working..
[05:18] <cadu> like, she hates amsn , whatever....
[05:18] <john64> i am a developer (in training ;) ) and 64bit is still useless
[05:18] <pschulz01> _greenie: Install ALSO from scratch using.. http://www.gidnetwork.com/b-106.html
[05:18] <pagefault> well I am trying to port things to 64-bit
[05:18] <pagefault> so I need it ;)
[05:18] <Toma-> DanSchnell: just do it by hand?
[05:18] <john64> haha
[05:18] <blameless> cadu: run msn messenger in vmware player
[05:18] <pschulz01> _greenie: Quote - Kernel 2.6.16 Note: Interestingly enough, the driver for the Intel HD Audio in kernel 2.6.16 is broken.
[05:18] <cadu> i thinking in putting vmware inside ubuntu and put messenger there
[05:18] <DanSchnell> Toma-: In terminal?
[05:18] <john64> blameless: what is wrong with gaim
[05:18] <michaelfavia> where can i get old ubuntu kernels?
[05:18] <hicks> yea use a virtual machine
[05:19] <cadu> seems like a gordian knot but it's a solution ;)
[05:19] <Toma-> DanSchnell: or synaptic
[05:19] <hicks> xen can work to but it will be harder to setup
[05:19] <hicks> and you need the right cpu to work
[05:19] <DanSchnell> Toma-: Forgot it was in synaptic...lol!
[05:19] <Toma-> cadu: you know theres a new amsn out?
[05:19] <cadu> vmware player is free now ?
[05:19] <pagefault> you would be amazed as how uncompatible 32-bit assembly is in 64-bit mdoe
[05:19] <hicks> yea cadu it is
[05:19] <pagefault> they removed a lot of instructions
[05:19] <john64> it always was cadu
[05:19] <blameless> john64: nothing.  but he said she didn't prefer amsn so i figured she'd want msn
[05:19] <cadu> Toma-: i like it...my wife can't stand it ;)
[05:19] <Dr_Willis> vmware server has a free version also.
[05:19] <blameless> cadu: the player is, not the workstation
[05:19] <mhiku> drivers/char/keyboard.c: In function `kbd_keycode': drivers/char/keyboard.c:1262: error: too few arguments to function `speakup_key' drivers/char/keyboard.c:1288: error: too few arguments to function `speakup_key' make[2] : *** [drivers/char/keyboard.o]  Error 1 make[1] : *** [drivers/char]  Error 2 make: *** [drivers]  Error 2, can someone help me fix in the latest kernel?
[05:19] <Toma-> cadu: have you tried another theme on her? :D
[05:19] <cadu> john64: that's the problem...
[05:19] <DanSchnell> Blameless: Server is free too, to some extent
[05:20] <hicks> its easy to get the features of the work station out of the player
[05:20] <cadu> i need to create a "virtual machine config file" to use with player
[05:20] <john64> ok, i am lost, do you not like Gaim or aMSN?
[05:20] <LNXempire> E: Package libdvdcss2 has no installation candidate
[05:20] <blameless> cadu: all the documentation to do that is online though
[05:20] <hicks> download the ubuntu browser vmware image and edit the config
[05:20] <pagefault> they finally stripped out the legacy mode instructions
[05:20] <LNXempire> how can I fix that?
[05:20] <michaelfavia> i removed an old kernel from my machine and id liek to reinstall it doo i have any recourse?
[05:20] <Toma-> btw, qemu would be better tbh
[05:20] <hicks> to boot from a windows xp cd
[05:20] <john64> LNXEmpire: www.videolan.org
[05:20] <cadu> john64: i like both ;) talking about my homie here ;~
[05:20] <john64> cadu: ok,  what about Kopete?
[05:21] <cadu> john64: she wants MSN Messenger, cute bluey with ads whatever, just the way she has always been accustomed to ;)
[05:21] <cadu> ahhahahaa
[05:21] <john64> it appears to be something that was in my ~ that was causing isses
[05:21] <hicks> lol
[05:21] <tale_> I just bought a new canon sd600 camera.  When I plug it up, gthumb detects it and I can copy pictures from the camera and delete them using gthumb's importer.  However, I can't find where it's mounted on the file system.  I think it is using PTP mode.  Would this mean it isn't mounted in a traditional sense?
[05:21] <john64> cadu: running VMWare just for MSN is a little overboard
[05:21] <john64> you may as well just run windows
[05:21] <pagefault> gaim not good enough?
[05:21] <hicks> or xen
[05:21] <john64> gaim is really better once you get used to it
[05:21] <hicks> his wife wants the Real MSN
[05:21] <effie_jayx> cadu find a nice theme for amsn :D
[05:22] <cadu> john64: nah, i have a nice cpu/ram/system, and you know women , if they want, they want. :(
[05:22] <pagefault> the real msn with all the ads and annoying spam?
[05:22] <Toma-> whats the relationship between wine and msn these days?
[05:22] <john64> running a whole OS just for MSN is a strange idea to me
[05:22] <blameless> i'm trying to get my girlfriend on google talk so i can switch to psi
[05:22] <pagefault> yikes
[05:22] <john64> cadu: i guess that is where i fall flat on the face
[05:22] <z0mbi3> will msn run with wine
[05:22] <john64> i don't know what they want :@
[05:22] <cadu> i still have a license of windows xp here, i'll just put it ...
[05:22] <pagefault> only one way to find out
[05:22] <john64> z0mbi3, maybe an old version
[05:22] <blameless> cadu: i got yelled at the other way because i couldn't open up one of the fiance's works files heh
[05:22] <john64> but likely not Live
[05:23] <cadu> blameless: hhahahahahah :)
[05:23] <john64> what about a dual boot?
[05:23] <john64> one os for the wife, one for you?
[05:23] <pagefault> yeah I just stopped using everything else except google talk
[05:23] <pagefault> so they have to use it to talk
[05:23] <hicks> lol i always keep a windows pc to protect myself from beatings
[05:23] <john64> googletalk is awesome
[05:23] <john64> hicks ?
[05:23] <Dr_Willis> windows 98 + vmware = handy
[05:23] <DanSchnell> Toma-: I go to Applications > System > EasyUbuntu and i click on it, and nothing ever happens
[05:23] <Dr_Willis> :)
[05:23] <cadu> also, maybe my webcam still isn't supported in linux, so i'll make it work in windows too...for her msn... we have parents overseas (ahahah actually we ran away from our home country) so we need taht
[05:23] <john64> easyubuntu is the devil
[05:23] <blameless> maybe it would be easier to get your wife her own machine for christmas ...
[05:23] <john64> so is automatix
[05:23] <Toma-> DanSchnell: try running it from a terminal
[05:24] <pagefault> they need a client for linux
[05:24] <pagefault> I know gaim works
[05:24] <DanSchnell> Toma-: Command?
[05:24] <pagefault> but a real one
[05:24] <cadu> john64: then how will i get my linux box running 24/7, serving stuff, downloading ? sucks
[05:24] <john64> imo, it is better to run linux as a guess in Windows than windows as a guest in linux
[05:24] <Toma-> DanSchnell: no idea. 'easyubuntu'?
[05:24] <cadu> john64: she gets home, wants to go to windows just to talk to friends, time waste....
[05:24] <john64> oh
[05:24] <cadu> i have to stop downloads, whatever i'm doing...think about it
[05:24] <john64> what about teaching her how to use gaim or amsn, they are dead simple
[05:25] <asjha> i got my wife a laptop so I could start playing with linux
[05:25] <cadu> john64: man it's not about knowing , she knows perfectly, she HATES ;)
[05:25] <john64> i guess i just don't get women :'(
[05:25] <cadu> not "cute" man, woman stuff
[05:25] <Dr_Willis> my wife always wanted these 'weird/eyecandy/oddball' gimmicy features that were only on the windows clients for her chatting.
[05:25] <Terminus> john64: why? works both ways and with windows on linux, less chance for the host to fall flat on it's face. =)
[05:25] <blameless> cadu: so, store.apple.com ... :)
[05:25] <Lukian> msn messenger doesn't work under wine @ Dr_Willis ? :p
[05:25] <Lukian> (Xen!)
[05:25] <christ__> hi
[05:26] <christ__> i'm a venezuelan
[05:26] <christ__> man
[05:26] <blameless> my fiance loves when the smilies explode in aim
[05:26] <john64> terminus, i personally prefer linux on windows, it works better from my experience, at least for using GUI applications in the guest
[05:26] <Dr_Willis> Luke,  no idea.. she perferd yahoo and was always installing some stupid yahoo thing that loaded the pc with spyware
[05:26] <blameless> i don't get it
[05:26] <brianski> hmmm, with 32 bit firefox, opening the link from another app results in a new (64 bit) instance
[05:26] <christ__> could anyone help me with something related to wine
[05:26] <LNXempire> anyone have a mp3 player working with Rythmbox, it says it support iPod, why not all damn mp3 player? Why only apple?
[05:26] <christ__> ??
[05:26] <john64> i don't know how multiple people use the same computer anyway
[05:26] <john64> i can't stand letting other people on my machine
[05:26] <pagefault> very carefully
[05:27] <cadu> blameless: nah, i'll put a small windows xp with just messenger and firefox, can be put on full screen, will eat 256mb while being used but i've got 1.5gb of ram and dual-core so it's okay...when she finishes she powers off her 'puter' and my downloads don't get interrupted nor anything i'm doing...
[05:27] <Dr_Willis> LNXempire,  most mp3 players should be syupported if they show up as a usb-drive
[05:27] <Terminus> john64: depends on what you use it for i guess... if you mean using photoshop and all, then linux on windows is fine.
[05:27] <christ__> i'd like someone help
[05:27] <LNXempire> Dr_Willis: on Rythmbox?
[05:27] <blameless> cadu: that'll work :)
[05:27] <john64> terminus, imo, linux on windows is the best way
[05:27] <LNXempire> I don't see, I see the folder on the Desktop but no Rythmbox
[05:27] <john64> windows applications are a lot more demanding, VM's aren't really fast for gui stuff
[05:27] <cadu> i'll just server internet for it via linux and a small home drive (like Z:) on windows where she'll store her files (actually on LINUX)
[05:27] <Toma-> cadu: better yet, get it to run in a new X session!
[05:27] <cadu> yay
[05:27] <cadu> ;)
[05:27] <Dr_Willis> LNXempire,  no idea there i use a psp for mine. but i tend to manyally handle the files.
[05:27] <christ__> i'm new and i want to solve the problem related to wine more detailed msn messenger
[05:27] <cadu> Toma-: her account, probably....
[05:28] <john64> damn,  all my partitions keep showing up on the desktop
[05:28] <john64> i don't need to browse /boot that often! :P
[05:28] <Toma-> yeh :D she can log in, have it start vmware/qemu in a blank X session
[05:28] <Terminus> john64: well, i'll only use linux on windows if i don't have any choice. i do not like host systems needing a reboot while there're 4 vm servers on it. =P
[05:28] <LNXempire> Dr_Willis: so how would you do that?
[05:28] <cadu> dualbooting windows/linux has some serious issues like.... what filesystem will you use on the "data" partition ?
[05:28] <john64> terminus: you are talking about servers, i am talking about end user stuff
[05:28] <blameless> cadu: you could probably just have a gdm logon for her that boots vmplayer fullscreen as a "session".  she powers it off when she's done and it logs her out
[05:28] <cadu> if you use ntfs windows will be happy but linux won't
[05:28] <Dr_Willis> LNXempire,  i plug the thing in.. it shows up as usb drive.. i drag the mp3's to the rigt place.. i dont change songs much. :)
[05:28] <pagefault> well you can get ext3 drivers for windows
[05:28] <cadu> blameless: GOOD IDEA!
[05:29] <blameless> i've never actually tried that so ...
[05:29] <cadu> pagefault: and then....ext3 for windows is non-existant
[05:29] <Terminus> john64: like i said, it depends on what you're using it for.
[05:29] <christ__> thanks john
[05:29] <cadu> it's EXT2
[05:29] <pagefault> ext3 is compatible with ext2
[05:29] <cadu> i know this driver, it reads ext3 coz it is just ext2 + journal
[05:29] <john64> cadu: i can read/write on EXT3 from windows, and read/write with NTFS in linux
[05:29] <EnsilZah> Can someone help me with my NVIDIA drivers?      I've upgraded to edgy but now when i start it i get an error about not being able to start X, something about driver being a different version than the kernel. =/
[05:29] <john64> it isn't a biggy, i personally have my data in my /home
[05:29] <pagefault> I still don't trust linux writing NTFS
[05:29] <cadu> but no journaling, fscked up rights (driver reads everything and writes as root~
[05:29] <yg_home> hi, can I find out which package a certain file belongs too in Ubuntu ?
[05:29] <john64> ensilzah: did you reinstall the driver?
[05:30] <LNXempire> Dr_Willis: that's screwed up... because then you have to open a thousand folder to find your song, instead of transfering a desired playlist
[05:30] <brianski> ahh wait, my mistake. my firefox wrapper script didn't pass arguments it was given, heh
[05:30] <cadu> john64: what did you use to write ntfs on linux? (is it perfect?)
[05:30] <LNXempire> Dr_Willis: that's not a modern way of doing that
[05:30] <john64> ensilzah:  you are going to have to resinstall the dirvers
[05:30] <jrib> yg_home: if it is installed you can use dpkg -S, otherwise go to packages.ubuntu.com or use apt-file
[05:30] <john64> cadu: ntfs-3g, it is based on Fuse
[05:30] <EnsilZah> john64: I'm not quite sure what that entails.
[05:30] <pagefault> you can write ntfs in linux through the kernel or get the ntfs.sys wrapper driver
[05:30] <cadu> john64: like you trust it to put your -data- (i mean your media/games/documents/mp3 etc) on it
[05:30] <john64> cadu: yes
[05:30] <john64> ensilzah: reinstall the driver
[05:30] <cadu> ntfs.sys, hmmmm
[05:30] <john64> re run the installer
[05:31] <pagefault> it uses MS's driver in linux
[05:31] <john64> ntfs-3g?
[05:31] <pagefault> sort of how ndiswrapper works
[05:31] <cadu> john64: nice... trusteable ?
[05:31] <john64> i thought it was a native implementation
[05:31] <EnsilZah> john64: I'm not quite sure how to do that.
[05:31] <Dr_Willis> LNXempire,  so. :)  make a link.. or wrte a script.. I dont worry much about it.
[05:31] <christ__> hi
[05:31] <cadu> coz right -now- i have a 300gb NTFS "data" partition that i can't really use on linux ;(
[05:31] <john64> cadu: i trust it
[05:31] <asjha> ok, getting ready to go watch a movie with the wife, so i'll ask one last time in case someone has come online that can help...
[05:31] <john64> !nvidia
[05:31] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:32] <LNXempire> Dr_Willis: like I know how to do that, OSX and XP handle that automatically
[05:32] <christ__> i'd like what version of wine do i have to put msn messenger on my ubuntu system
[05:32] <john64> ensilzah: download the drivers then run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
[05:32] <john64> then run the installer from the shell
[05:32] <asjha> is there a way to instal gksudo or some similar program to allow sudo in xwin on a Dapper Server install with xwin base and xfce installed?
[05:32] <brianski> anyone running ubuntu on x86_64, please join me in #ubuntu64
[05:32] <birdmun> is there any good way to upon startup have different programs start on different virtual desktops? i have searched and found something called wmctrl mentioned but i dont quite grasp how to get it to do what i want to do
[05:33] <john64> join #ubuntu64
[05:33] <asjha> I know sudo can be used at terminal, but from what i've read, that can cause problems for gui apps
[05:33] <Dr_Willis> LNXempire,  and this is my fault? :)
[05:33] <orphean> asjha: use gksudo for gui apps
[05:33] <orphean> er nm
[05:33] <LNXempire> Dr_Willis: nope, i am just highly disapointed can't do some as simple as that
[05:34] <Dr_Willis> LNXempire,  if the mp3 player shows up as a usb drive the program should handle it.. they are fairly standard in tat reguard.
[05:34] <Dr_Willis> LNXempire,  check that programs homepage/docs....
[05:34] <klp> how do I install ktorrent under ubuntu?

[05:38] <jrib> klp: yes, in multiverse there is mozilla-mplayer
[05:38] <john64> noodles12: i have the same problem, no freezing though, it is a driver bug
[05:38] <whyameye> I'm trying the alternate install and my settings for RAID/LVM just aren't sticking. For example, I've set the swap partition over and over and somehow it keeps coming unset and then the install complains that no swap partition is defined.
[05:38] <ArrenLex> noodles12: What you just pasted. You can't be using "radeon" driver and have ATI Technologies as your renderer string. It's not possible.
[05:38] <pagefault> yep
[05:38] <pagefault> radeon is DRI driver
[05:38] <john64> X1600 doesnt support the ATI/Radeon driver
[05:38] <asjha> well, i'm off.  g'night
[05:38] <john64> only FGLRX and Vesa
[05:38] <john64> night

[05:39] <corevette> anyone know why my update manager isn't detecting any updates?

[05:40] <ArrenLex> !anyone
[05:40] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:40] <ckarini> okay,
[05:40] <ArrenLex> !enter
[05:40] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.

[05:40] <ckarini> they dont work
[05:40] <elkbuntu> ArrenLex, stop it.
[05:40] <ckarini> i can install them
[05:40] <ckarini> cnat*
[05:40] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Are you still there?
[05:40] <elkbuntu> ckarini, where are you downloading them from? the repositories?
[05:40] <ArrenLex> ckarini: "don't work" is kind of vague. Can you be more specific?

[05:41] <cadu> john64: what are you using that uses the ntfs.sys driver?
[05:41] <frogzoo> !doesn't work
[05:41] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.

[05:43] <jrib> corevette: having said that, there are backports made of programs.  You may wish to request a backport for your program or even learn and create one yourself to help others :)
[05:43] <ArrenLex> stormy|: If your question is "how do I reinstall a package", the answer is "apt-get install --reinstall <package>".

[05:44] <john64> if you are getting the message saying that it will remove ubuntu-desktop, don't worry, it wont uninstall anything but python, ubunut-desktop is an empty packages thatjust depends on a lot of other stuff
[05:44] <klp> ubuntu set DisplaySize to 98dpi?
[05:44] <frogzoo> IdleOne: checked sound preferences for mutes ?
[05:44] <john64> klp: check your xorg.conf
[05:44] <LNXempire> frogzoo: I am using 6.10 but the thing is that Rythmbox can even recognize my mp3 player
[05:44] <stormy|> ArrenLex: I've got a broken package problem when I do "apt-get install python2.4*", so I figure that will fix the problem as it fixed the same issue with another file (according to the ubuntu forums)
[05:44] <IdleOne> frogzoo,  yes I removed all mutes
[05:44] <ckarini> im leaving
[05:44] <ckarini> ill get answers later
[05:45] <tripper> SOS! Re 6.06LTS -- why does my system hang when i insert a usb flashdisk? help!!!
[05:45] <Skwid_> anyone ?
[05:45] <stormy|> ArrenLex: What caused that, is installing it manually (as far as I know)... and something going somewhat wierd
[05:45] <ArrenLex> stormy|: If you have a broken package problem, apt will complain about it whatever you try to install.
[05:45] <jrib> stormy|: can you pastebin your sources.list?
[05:45] <ArrenLex> stormy|: It would help if you pastebinned the exact error.
[05:45] <stormy|> ArrenLex: apt-get wasn't very happy
[05:45] <stormy|> jrib:  where is the sources.list?
[05:45] <john64> /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:45] <frogzoo> IdleOne:  you check all devices ? file -> change device
[05:45] <jrib> stormy|: /etc/apt/sources.list , the error would be helpful too as ArrenLex said
[05:47] <dodgyville> Hello.
[05:47] <dodgyville> Does anyone know where I can get dapper debs for php 5.2?
[05:47] <IdleOne> frogzoo,  Thank you for your help but Im a moron I had the speakers plugged in the wrong place :/
[05:47] <john64> maybe the dapper repository?
[05:47] <frogzoo> IdleOne: that will do it :)
[05:47] <john64> or packages.ubuntu.com
[05:47] <stormy|> jrib:  o.0 it appears that sources.list has nothing in it!
[05:47] <IdleOne> :)
[05:47] <jrib> stormy|: that's bad, are you sure you didn't make a typo?
[05:48] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Are you there man?
[05:48] <stormy|> jrib:  it may have been that i was compiling something
[05:48] <jrib> stormy|: no that shouldn't do it.  What were you compiling?
[05:48] <jbinder> hi
[05:48] <stormy|> jrib:  blender
[05:49] <jbinder> right
[05:49] <jrib> stormy|: you know blender is in the repositories?
[05:49] <LNXempire> ok last chance to stay with Gnome Ubuntu... can someone help how do I set up Rythmbox to read my mp3 player and be able to transfer songs and playlists?
[05:49] <john64> lnxempire
[05:49] <stormy|> jrib:  it doesn't work, so I tried compiling my own version
[05:49] <dodgyville> Sorry,  I should have said for edgy eft (6.10) and I can only find 5.1.6 in the repositories...
[05:49] <john64> : which mp3 player?
[05:49] <ArrenLex> stormy|: If it doesn't work, file a bug@
[05:49] <ArrenLex> !
[05:49] <stormy|> jrib:  I get the same problem... let me get the error real quick
[05:49] <john64> most non-iPod ones work by just copying the files over in nautilus
[05:49] <frogzoo> LNXempire: amarok may be worth a shot
[05:49] <john64> also, try Amarok
[05:49] <john64> it is MUCH better
[05:50] <whyameye> the thing about Amarok is no JACK support.
[05:50] <stormy|> jrib: blender-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.4.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[05:50] <shriphani> even the ipod can be made to work with just nautilus in hand
[05:50] <john64> jack?
[05:50] <shriphani> thx to rockbox
[05:50] <stormy|> jrib:  I am also on x64 dapper drake...
[05:51] <LNXempire> frogzoo: that's what I am saying, I already have k3b to clone CD's DVD's now amarok for mp3 compatability, I might as well migrate. Sad I wanna stay with Ubuntu
[05:51] <LNXempire> sorry pals
[05:51] <khaije1> i'm looking for a home-use printer/scanner (photo printing ability would be nice) any suggestion or recommendations?
[05:51] <john64> KDE apps on gnome is pefectly fine
[05:51] <shriphani> LNXempire, which mp3 player is that ?
[05:51] <jbinder> khaije1: uh... no?
[05:51] <jbinder> khaije1: i have an epson
[05:51] <jbinder> khaije1: works perfectly
[05:51] <jrib> stormy|: does /usr/lib/libpython2.4.so.1.0 exist?
[05:51] <jbinder> khaije1: and 2 of my friends have HPs
[05:51] <LNXempire> shriphani: COBY
[05:51] <john64> i use Kate, Konqueror and Amarok on gnome and it works flawlessly with no performance hit
[05:52] <jbinder> khaije1: they work perfectly too
[05:52] <superchode|fu> if the person who was interested is still in here... i just got flash 9 running with opera under an amd64 install
[05:52] <jbinder> k
[05:52] <stormy|> jrib: Yes.
[05:52] <khaije1> jbinder: what model is that, i need something highly linux compatible, free drivers are a plus
[05:52] <dougsko> john64: if you like kate, check out scite :)
[05:52] <LNXempire> shriphani: wait should I perhaps FORMAT the mp3? Cause I hit the SCAN REMOVABLE DEVICES on Rythmbox and doesn't recognize a damn thing
[05:52] <stormy|> jrib:  Also the CHMOD on the file is 644
[05:52] <john64> if the person who was interested in getting flash 9 to work, it was one file copy on 32 bit
[05:52] <maxamillion> someone by the nick of QUEEN get banned from here recently?
[05:52] <jbinder> khaije1: mine is "epson stylus cx4600"
[05:52] <john64> dougsko: is it that good?  i have heard a lot of good things, but never bothered to try
[05:52] <MoonGlade> I just did a fresh install of 6.06, if I do an update, will it go up to 6.10?
[05:53] <john64> apt-get update? no
[05:53] <jrib> MoonGlade: not unless you tell it to
[05:53] <john64> apt-get dist-upgrade: maybe
[05:53] <superchode|fu> john64: it just so happens to be a one file copy on 64 bit as well... as long as you use opera
[05:53] <MoonGlade> jrid what it the proper way to move up then?
[05:53] <john64> hahaha
[05:53] <maxamillion> sudo aptitude install eclipse ?
[05:53] <maxamillion> oops
[05:53] <jrib> !upgrade | MoonGlade
[05:53] <ubotu> MoonGlade: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:53] <maxamillion> someone by the nick of QUEEN get banned from here recently?
[05:53] <shriphani> LNXempire, is that player not formatted as fat or hfs or something ?
[05:53] <dougsko> john64: IMO, once you try it, youll never use another gui editor again
[05:53] <LNXempire> maxamillion: yes, He was kickbanned and he hanged himself as he said he would do if kickbanned
[05:53] <MoonGlade> thanks
[05:53] <john64> i must check it out then
[05:53] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: I'm back - what's up?
[05:53] <jbinder> MoonGlade: apt-get dist-upgrade will do 6.10
[05:53] <LNXempire> shriphani: is fat
[05:53] <jbinder> MoonGlade: only if you edit the apt file
[05:53] <khaije1> jbinder: thats just a printer isn't it? know of any printer/scanner combos i could use?
[05:53] <jrib> jbinder: that won't work and isn't recommended
[05:54] <jbinder> khaije1: no, that is a 3in one
[05:54] <jbinder> jrib: what are you talking about... i did it myself...
[05:54] <maxamillion> LNXempire: well he went into #kubuntu and freaked out there for a while and now is in #xubuntu doing the same thing ... just thought i would check
[05:54] <dodgyville> Do think it's safe to install the debian php 5.2 package?
[05:54] <jbinder> jrib: no problem at all
[05:54] <jbinder> jrib: wtf are you talking about
[05:54] <jrib> jbinder: you edited your sources.list no? ;)
[05:54] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: got it to install but I still have the X server error
[05:54] <jbinder> jrib: yeah
[05:54] <stormy|> jrib:  any idea what is wrong?
[05:54] <jbinder> jrib: that is really easy, what's wrong with doing that?
[05:54] <LNXempire> maxamillion: ROFL I wanna see that
[05:54] <john64> that lnxempire guy is funny, as if i care if he uses gnome, kde or xfce, they are all free!
[05:54] <jrib> jbinder: that's why, but it still isn't recommended
[05:54] <jbinder> lol
[05:54] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: is it up and running now?
[05:54] <jbinder> uh
[05:54] <jbinder> its the way ubuntu.com tells you to anyway
[05:54] <jrib> stormy|: no not really
[05:55] <jbinder> khaije1: it is a 3 in one
[05:55] <khaije1> jbinder: what do you mean "3in one"
[05:55] <jbinder> khaije1: printer, scanner, copier
[05:55] <jbinder> khaije1: epson stylus cx4600
[05:55] <jbinder> its right in front of me
[05:55] <jbinder> i am reading the model number off of it
[05:55] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: am at grub right now
[05:55] <jbinder> i know it is right
[05:55] <tigerman> ok.. I have a somewhat silly question.. Is there some good data/partition recovery program for ubuntu?
[05:56] <jbinder> uh
[05:56] <jbinder> gparted?
[05:56] <stormy|> jrib:  from what i've seen here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1507 , the issue lies in the package holding it. he installed his nvidia drivers manually, whereas I installed python2.4 manually... so I want to remove all python and reinstall it using apt-get
[05:56] <jbinder> oh
[05:56] <jbinder> recovery
[05:56] <jbinder> uh.
[05:56] <jbinder> what happened to it?
[05:56] <jrib> stormy|: what do you mean by "manually" exactly?  you compiled it?
[05:56] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: so it boots up into a term or same problem as earlier?
[05:56] <tigerman> I cant mount a drive that has a linux partition.. It says bad superblock as one of the probable causes..
[05:56] <stormy|> jrib: hmm... I believe that is what I did... let me see what i downloaded
[05:56] <khaije1> jbinder: oh! no kidding? that sounds perfect. I've spent some time googling but haven't come up with a clear leader. is this the one you would recommend?
[05:57] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: same as earlier
[05:57] <whyameye> tigerman: probably apps that start with fsck like fsck.ext3 if you are using ext3 formatting...
[05:57] <jbinder> khaije1: well, i have it and it works with no problem. so i guess
[05:57] <shriphani> This flash drive / mp3 player is available at Fry"s for 100 dollars and seems to work fine with linux, unlike the first model I tried. I had to partition with fdisk and format with mkdosfs before using it.
[05:57] <khaije1> jbinder: hehe sweet! :-)
[05:57] <jbinder> khaije1: actually... the printer and scanner worked with no proble
[05:57] <jbinder> m
[05:57] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: you have xorg modified to use vesa, correct?
[05:57] <jbinder> i didnt even have to install any drivers
[05:57] <shriphani> some guy has posted that as a comment on one of them COBYs
[05:57] <jbinder> linux had them already
[05:57] <stormy|> jrib:  if building = compiling, then yes.

[05:58] <arathald> bitflip: thx for your help
[05:58] <jbinder> dpkg --configure <package>?
[05:58] <jbinder> sudo
[05:59] <meheren> i thought it was like dpkg-reconfigure?
[05:59] <whyameye> tigerman: what do you mean "don't find errors?" They aren't finding errors for you? They are FileSystem ChecKs so i would expect them to check the file system, no?
[05:59] <meheren> oh.. he
[05:59] <meheren> thanks!
[05:59] <bitflip> arathald: np - that process is pretty robust so I didn't expect you to have problems
[05:59] <jbinder> lol
[05:59] <superchode|fu> is there a global way to set alsamixer to always use my 2nd audio output device?
[05:59] <tigerman> whyameye: yeah.. the file system it cant read..
[05:59] <jbinder> superchode|fu: yes, but i forgot how
[05:59] <Giggel> gday
[05:59] <superchode|fu> lol
[05:59] <tigerman> it actually says "clean" but its really not
[05:59] <jbinder> superchode|fu: meh
[05:59] <jbinder> superchode|fu: uhh
[05:59] <whyameye> tigerman: do you force a check?

[06:02] <tigerman> whyameye: it only gies "the superblock could not be read" when i say "nothing useful"
[06:03] <stormy|> jrib: I dont' know how to uninstall my python2.4
[06:03] <whyameye> tigerman: I assume you are running as root...
[06:03] <jrib> stormy|: try  make uninstall  from the source directory
[06:03] <DiscoStu> ic, fglrx doesn't support 9100 :/
[06:03] <jrib> stormy|: assuming you used  make install  to install it?
[06:03] <tigerman> whyameye sudo fsck blabla yeah
[06:03] <php-freak> can someone help me I got a intel 82801DB/DBL/DBM audio driver 97 chipset, but I can not get it to work for nothing, and looked everywhere for a solution?
[06:03] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: reboot it with your changes and start from there before we go further
[06:03] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: ko
[06:04] <stalefries> jrib: I've defined them in ~/.bash_aliases (and I enabled that in .bashrc) but they aren't recognized commands
=== umop is now known as umop_
[06:04] <AnthonyG> Hmph.... I know for certain my ISP didn't give me any DNS server IP addresses. Since when does 56K do that anyway?
[06:05] <jrib> stalefries: you'll need to source it in your current session, since .bashrc only gets sourced at the start.  Try  source ~/.bash_aliases
[06:05] <stalefries> DiscoStu: have you looked at the radeon driver? It's a radeon, right?
[06:05] <stormy|> jrib: I did the ./configure again and it says : configure: error: cannot find install-sh or install.sh in . ./.. ./../..
[06:05] <stalefries> jrib: ah, right. thanks
[06:05] <DiscoStu> stalefries: i'm just reading the opensource ati driver site
[06:05] <whyameye> tigerman: you could try to find an alternative superblock: sudo mke2fs -n <partition>
[06:05] <stalefries> ok
[06:05] <stormy|> jrib: I did that because I didn't see a makefile anywhere
[06:05] <Eroick> if i start a proceess from python on linux, can I get the PID?
[06:05] <AnthonyG> OpenSource drivers? Where?
=== umop_ is now known as umop
[06:06] <tigerman> ill try that
[06:06] <jrib> Eroick: maybe #python might be a better place to ask
[06:06] <AnthonyG> Scratch compilation rulez , DiscoStu: Where is this?
[06:06] <php-freak> can someone help me I got a intel 82801DB/DBL/DBM audio driver 97 chipset, but I can not get it to work for nothing, and looked everywhere for a solution?
[06:06] <php-freak> Can any one answer my question lol
[06:06] <foomanchew> anyone running Ubuntu on SPARC
[06:06] <stalefries> AnthonyG: those are the default boring drivers for ati cards, 2d only
[06:07] <jrib> stormy|: hmm, have you considered just backing up your data and reinstalling.  I'm not really sure what is going on and that may be the easiest solution
[06:07] <AnthonyG> Ah...
[06:07] <stalefries> AnthonyG: they should already be installed/in use if you have an ati card
[06:07] <RoKFiT> hello all
[06:07] <AnthonyG> There are no open source 3D accelerated ones?
[06:07] <stormy|> jrib: not really... but it woudln't be that hard to do I don't think
[06:07] <nbjayme> hello, i am suffering from memory loss. what command line utility was it that you use to get information of a video file encoding (bitrates, etc.)?
[06:07] <stalefries> AnthonyG: for some radeon cards, there are
[06:07] <Eroick> jrib: whoops, I thought this was #python...
[06:07] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: restarted opened ubuntu form gurb now dont have display
[06:07] <stalefries> Eroick: I've done that before :)
[06:07] <AnthonyG> I've got an ATI Radeon, Is this supported?
[06:07] <jrib> stormy|: well redownload the source and try ./configure on a fresh source
[06:07] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: not even on your virtual terminals?
[06:08] <meheren> how do i reconfigure X?
[06:08] <stalefries> AnthonyG: _certain_ radeon cards.
[06:08] <stalefries> !radeon | AnthonyG
[06:08] <Eroick> stalefries: I think I closed or moved the tab for #python so ended up here.
[06:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about radeon - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:08] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: nothing
[06:08] <stalefries> aw
[06:08] <foomanchew> Sparc anyone ?
[06:08] <php-freak> can someone help me I got a intel 82801DB/DBL/DBM audio driver 97 chipset, but I can not get it to work for nothing, and looked everywhere for a solution?
[06:08] <superchode|fu> hrm. why does it say alsaconf and alsa-conf don't exist?
[06:08] <stalefries> AnthonyG: I'll try to dig up a link for you to read
[06:08] <superchode|fu> how do i configure alsa?
[06:08] <AnthonyG> No no no
[06:08] <jrib> ubotu: tell meheren about xorg
[06:08] <AnthonyG> It's an Xpress 200
[06:08] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: quick question - when you booted did it show a splash screen or text while booting?
[06:09] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: text and splash
[06:09] <meheren> jrib, thanks
[06:09] <AnthonyG> Bah, ATI Radeon Xpress 200 Series <--Terrible I know
[06:09] <jrib> meheren: ignore the bot, wrong factoid.  Here is how to reconfigure xserver-xorg:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:10] <chalcedony> hi
[06:10] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: sorry man - reboot and at grub edit before it boots, remove the word splash with xforcevesa
[06:10] <chalcedony> bash: gThumb: command not found
[06:10] <AnthonyG> stalefries: No need to give me any laymen FAQs, I know what a graphics card is :)
[06:10] <chalcedony> what can i use to show a .jpg?
[06:10] <LNXempire> hey what kinda port do I need to use with Amarok is reporting that 59273 or something like that isn't workig
[06:10] <AnthonyG> gthumb img
[06:10] <chalcedony> ty AnthonyG :)
[06:11] <AnthonyG> :D
[06:11] <raghu206> how to get connected to oracle using command connect in ubuntu
[06:11] <stalefries> AnthonyG: here's the offering for radeon cards: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon#Linux
[06:11] <AnthonyG> stalefries: Thank you :)
[06:11] <stalefries> welcome, AnthonyG
[06:12] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: doing that now
=== mikm[moo]  is now known as morbo
[06:13] <stormy|> jrib: I got ./configure to work on clean source
[06:13] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: apologies for not mentioning that earlier...d'oh!
[06:13] <whyameye> why don't my settings stick with the ubuntu alternative installer with RAID and LVM? I'm not sure what to try now...
[06:13] <stormy|> jrib:  now how do I uninstall it?
[06:13] <LNXempire> is aMule a different network than Frostwire?
[06:13] <php-freak> whats a good php editor for linux?
[06:13] <jrib> stormy|: did you run ./configure with the same exact options as before and this is the same source (version) as before?
[06:13] <Terminus> php-freak: vim? =)
[06:13] <AnthonyG> stalefries: Bah, Simply a long-winded: Xpress is not supported. IGP isn't too terrible....
[06:13] <stormy|> jrib: Yes.
[06:14] <jrib> stormy|: sudo make uninstall
[06:14] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: a black screen again it just doesn't like me
[06:14] <stalefries> AnthonyG: sorry to hear that. My card is too old to be supported :)
[06:14] <php-freak> ahh vim
[06:14] <stormy|> jrib:  "no rule to make target uninstall"
[06:14] <php-freak> well they have zend developers kit right
[06:14] <BlueEagle> php-freak: That would probably be an editor with features like function folding, syntax highlighting and intuitive interface. Seamles ftp-upload might also be desirable.
[06:14] <php-freak> yea
[06:14] <jrib> stormy|: heh, have fun then.  Do you have backups?
[06:14] <php-freak> Well I need something to edit my html, php, javascript, and sql
[06:14] <Terminus> php-freak: yes, but you'd have to buy it. i tried it before, didn't like it. too slow, and it messes up the packaging system.
[06:14] <AnthonyG> stalefries: At least I'm not alone XD
[06:14] <stormy|> jrib:  of the system?
[06:15] <jrib> stormy|: yes, before we continue
[06:15] <php-freak> whats it do to the packing system
[06:15] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: so ctrl-alt-f1 doesn't give you aconsole term?
[06:15] <BlueEagle> php-freak: I for one find kate and quanta functional, intuitive and featured. Others in turn find that they are bloated.
[06:15] <stormy|> jrib: almost all of it atm is just packages and things i'm trying to install.. and a UI setup... but i can get that again
[06:15] <jrib> stormy|: ok, what is in your /usr/local ?
[06:15] <php-freak> yea
[06:15] <php-freak> terminus: you a developer for a living?
[06:15] <whyameye> is LVM broken in the ubuntu alternate install? I've tried on dapper and edgy...
[06:15] <stalefries> AnthonyG: we should form a support group :D
[06:15] <LNXempire> guys I've got an issue with Amarok what port do i have to set postgres
[06:15] <stormy|> jrib:  what if I tried doing that apt-get remove python2.4*?
[06:16] <jrib> stormy|: it won't work because python probably got installed to /usr/local
[06:16] <Terminus> php-freak: it installs files anywhere on your filesystem and it wants to install it's own apache, etc. difficult to maintain.
[06:16] <AnthonyG> stalefries: THA: Terrible Hardware Anonymous :)
[06:16] <Terminus> php-freak: sort of, yeah. actually, i quit php. got fed up with it.
[06:16] <stalefries> lol
[06:16] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: it's like it doesn't see my monitor any more
[06:16] <AnthonyG> stalefries: Wait a moment , I see one for my GC....
[06:17] <stormy|> jrib: contents of /usr/local/:bin  etc  games  include  lib  man  sbin  share  src
[06:17] <stalefries> AnthonyG: ooh!
[06:17] <stormy|> jrib:  they all are folders except for man I believe
[06:17] <AnthonyG> http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux/linux-firegl.html
[06:17] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: what about during boot - do you see inittab spawing processes or does it go black before that?
[06:17] <jrib> stormy|: yeah, the stuff inside.  See any python?
[06:17] <rukuartic> Ok, I have a rather odd question not particularly related to ubuntu, but its bugging me and I can't think of a way to search for it. My speakers beep. My Car speakers beep. My headphones beep. And they're all on completely different systems. "Beep be-beep, beep be-beep, beep be-beep"
[06:17] <rukuartic> Any cluse?
[06:17] <Terminus> php-freak: BlueEagle is right though, block folding is convenient. autocomplete too.
[06:18] <php-freak> nice
[06:18] <php-freak> terminus: lol why did you quite php for?
[06:18] <stormy|> jrib:  in subfolders of /usr/local? or just that folder itself? If it's that folder itself...obviously there isn't any python
[06:18] <jrib> stormy|: like /usr/local/lib/python maybe?
[06:18] <php-freak> i didn't know ubuntu had a itegrated bittorrent program
[06:18] <Terminus> php-freak: the library made me want to pull out my hair. switched over to perl. =)
[06:18] <php-freak> lol
[06:18] <BlueEagle> php-freak: Yeah, kate (and subsequently quanta) has got a plugin for text complete. It doesn't error check that such functions or variables are valid tho, but it's helpful enough.
[06:19] <Madpilot> php-freak, it always has had
[06:19] <stormy|> jrib: ./bin has: python, python2.5, python2.5-config, python-config, and pydoc
[06:19] <php-freak> yea
[06:19] <php-freak> you guys would'nt happen to know how i can get my sound card working would you?
[06:19] <Madpilot> !sound | php-freak
[06:19] <ubotu> php-freak: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[06:19] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: do you see inittab spawing processes? yes then right before the login screen it acts as if there is no monitor
[06:19] <BlueEagle> php-freak: By loading the driver and setting up the sound system. :)
[06:20] <BlueEagle> php-freak: (ie: You need to be waaay more spesific) :)
[06:20] <stormy|> jrib: /lib has folders python2.4 and 2.5
[06:20] <AnthonyG> stalefries: If only there was a good support for my modem :D
[06:20] <stormy|> jrib: maybe they are conflicting?
[06:20] <jrib> stormy|: ok, now is there anything installed in /usr/local that you want?  It would be easiest to just delete everything...
[06:20] <stalefries> AnthonyG: that too? lol. There's a good reason to use old hardware sometimes: better hardware support pre-existent :D

[06:21] <DiscoStu> direct rendering: No
[06:21] <Madpilot> bigfuzzyjesus, I'll let you back into -offtopic in a bit. Next time, pastebin!
[06:21] <Madpilot> Or just paste the URL
[06:21] <AnthonyG> stalefries: Does it sound odd to you I got SmartLink drivers to work with an Agere PCI Softmodem (V.92)? It does to me...
[06:21] <php-freak> I got a intel 82801DB/DBL/DBM audio driver 97 chipset,
[06:21] <stormy|> jrib: I don't see anything of use... I may take my themes and zip them up , then upload them to my FTP
[06:21] <stormy|> jrib: how do I use FTP via command line?
[06:22] <php-freak> blueeagle: its s intel82891db/dbl/dbm audio driver 97, but can't get it to work, my volume goes up, and down, and everything, but I hear no sound
[06:22] <narg> Is the built-in /var/lib/cvs/CVSROOT/ a usable cvs repository?
[06:22] <stalefries> AnthonyG: not that much, it's common for companies to license stuff to each other. Also, it might be chipset name/name on the box
[06:22] <jrib> stormy|: I don't know, but that's ok.  Just delete /usr/local/bin/python*, /usr/local/share/python* and /usr/local/lib/python*
[06:22] <BlueEagle> php-freak: Did you read the link ubotu spat at you?
[06:22] <SJrX> How well is suited is the Intel Core Duo for a modern notebook and Ubuntu?
[06:23] <dredhammer> does the latest avidemux hadle wmv3 input?
[06:23] <dredhammer> *handle
[06:23] <AnthonyG> stalefries: SmartLink Inc. stated it works with other brands as well... So not too farfetched hm? Would you happen to use a 56K modem?
[06:23] <stalefries> AnthonyG: nope, I live in the wondrous world of broadband :)
[06:24] <DiscoStu> so, is it well known that 9100 mobility isn't supported or am I doing things wrong?
[06:24] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: ok then, let's do this - reboot and at grub remove "splash" with "2"
[06:24] <stormy|> jrib: how can I do that? I'd have to do all the files manually... then the folders... >.>
[06:24] <php-freak> blueeagle: what link was that?
[06:24] <jrib> stormy|: rm -rf foo   deletes foo and everything in it
[06:24] <BlueEagle> ubotu: tell php-freak about sound
[06:24] <php-freak> i see hold on
[06:25] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Trying now
[06:25] <jrib> stormy|: umm make sure you are deleting the stuff in /usr/local since this isn't reversible
[06:25] <AnthonyG> stalefries: I do not like you....
[06:26] <stormy|> jrib:  done with that...
[06:27] <jrib> stormy|: ok, what does this return:  find /usr/local -iname '*python*'
[06:27] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: still right before the login screen it acts as if there is no monitor
[06:28] <bitflip> runlevel 2 is multiuser without gdm, correct?
[06:28] <stormy|> jrib: http://pastebin.ca/264259
[06:29] <Terminus> bitflip: not on ubuntu. you'll have to update-rc.d to remove it if you don't want gdm to start.

[06:31] <VigoFusion> Greetings
[06:31] <terrence> i've got a radeon xpress 200m card in my laptop
[06:31] <terrence> can't seem to get direct rendering working on edgy
[06:31] <xCrueLx> terrence azn topla ben guy deilim
[06:31] <terrence> had it working good in 6.06
[06:32] <stalefries> should alsa-utils be running normally?
[06:32] <stormy|> okay jrib, it can't find anything now
[06:32] <jrib> stormy|: ok, see if you still get errors
[06:32] <VigoFusion> terrence: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=273934 <--is how I got mine working, Xpress 200 Series
[06:33] <terrence> thank you
[06:33] <stormy|> jrib:  doing the apt-get?
[06:34] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: so now when you boot you can't get a terminal at all?
[06:34] <jrib> stormy|: yep, whatever wasn't working before
[06:34] <stalefries> What does alsa-utils do?
[06:34] <bigfuzzyjesus> Madpilot, how long were you in the ubuntu irc channels before you became an op
[06:35] <superchode|fu> can anyone tell me how to switch the default also device from hw:0,0 to hw:0,2?
[06:35] <superchode|fu> alsa* device, that is
[06:35] <jbinder> does anyone know if pc133 ram works in something that uses pc100
[06:35] <Madpilot> bigfuzzyjesus, hmm... about 5-6 months, I think
[06:35] <jbinder> because i know pc2700 works in pc2100
[06:35] <jbinder> so does pc133 work in pc100?
[06:35] <superchode|fu> jbinder: yeah, it will
[06:35] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: not now
[06:35] <jbinder> superchode|fu: omfg, really?
[06:35] <superchode|fu> yeah, it'll just clock down
[06:35] <tehuti> help! I upgraded to Edgy and now remote desktop is open in KDE with no GUI controller!
[06:36] <jbinder> superchode|fu: yeah but thats okay
[06:36] <superchode|fu> agreed
[06:36] <stalefries> anything is ok if you can get more RAM :)
[06:37] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: no termianl
[06:37] <stormy|> jrib: I still get conflicting issues
[06:37] <ajopaul_> hi i have a dual boot installed wit ubuntu and winxp, grub is on MBR, how do i move it to the partition where linux is installed ??
[06:37] <ajopaul_> i want to be able to boot to linux using xp's boot loader or a 3rd party boot loader?
[06:37] <stormy|> jrib: how do I set a certain folder to be the one that runs blender?
[06:37] <VigoFusion> tehuti: You can get the KDE apps that will work with that. I think, I got some KDE stuff working in Gnome.
[06:38] <jrib> stormy|: what do you mean?
[06:38] <TheCarl> can someone tell me how to change the linux partitions
[06:38] <TheCarl> the fdisk thing is causing a bit of confusion
[06:38] <stormy|> jrib: I have several instances of blender on my computer... it may be using one of the broken ones... how do I tell it to use the one i just compiled
[06:38] <jrib> stormy|: give it the full path  /usr/local/bin/blender or whatever it is
[06:38] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: am at the recovery console now in term
[06:39] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: from bad to worse...sweet.  let me see if I can hit worse-est-er
[06:39] <newbuntu> hello
[06:39] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: just for grins, change your xorg.conf from "vesa" to "vga"
[06:40] <tehuti> VigoFusion do you know which package?
[06:40] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Doing so now.
[06:40] <newbuntu> can anyone help me with some advice on a video card tv-out issue?
[06:40] <jrib> stormy|: what version of ubuntu is this?
[06:40] <levander> If I just upgraded to edgy, and haven't changed anything, what kernel am I supposed to be on?
[06:41] <tehuti> is there any way to turn off Remote Desktop in Kubuntu Edgy?
[06:41] <VigoFusion> tehuti: I am not certain on that, but all the KDE packages are listed and apprently work with the Gnome
[06:41] <Kingsqueak> levander: 2.6.17
[06:41] <DarkED> hey all, is the edgy cd a livecd + installer or is it text-mode?
[06:41] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Restarting
[06:41] <levander> Kingsqueak: damn, I was thinking that's the problem.  Why am I on 2.6.12?
[06:41] <john64> darked: get the dvd
[06:41] <newbuntu> my issue is when I have my pc connected to my TV via svideo .. i see my desktop perfectly on my tv, but when I play a movie say in Xine, the xine screen on the tv is empty...
[06:42] <DarkED> john: I cant
[06:42] <levander> Kingsqueak: does udev work with 2.6.12?
[06:42] <john64> the normal edgy cd is a livecd that has a livecd based installer
[06:42] <tehuti> VigoFusion, the Remote Desktop GUI config in Dapper is nonexistent in Edgy.
[06:42] <Kingsqueak> levander: it ordered my menu.lst oddly on one machine where I'd tampered with it, maybe your default kernel is just not the correct one
[06:42] <DarkED> john: okay, whats wrong with it?
[06:42] <Kingsqueak> levander: I don't know re: 12
[06:42] <tehuti> the Gnome GUI config would only affect Gnome
[06:42] <john64> nothing, but the dvd is better
[06:42] <stormy|> jrib: how do I run it that way?
[06:42] <VigoFusion> tehuti: System>Preferances> Remote Desktop
[06:42] <john64> i prefer the text mode install though
[06:42] <newbuntu> the only app I can use to see a movie playing on my pc  on my tv screen is ... beleive it or not .. swiftfox
[06:43] <DarkED> john: im just curious because i want to know if im gonna have to use partition magic or gparted to resize this ntf partition
[06:43] <jrib> stormy|: just type it like that, instead of 'blender', put '/usr/local/bin/blender'
[06:43] <newbuntu> which is okay but has limited controls
[06:43] <levander> Kingsqueak: no, damn.  ls /boot/*17* returns nothing, there's no 2.6.17 on my system
[06:43] <tehuti> works for Gnome VigoFusion but not KDE
[06:43] <lumpki> john64, then get the alternate cd
[06:43] <john64> darked: i know nothing about partition resizing
[06:43] <jrib> stormy|: 'which blender' tells you what it is doing
[06:43] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: with out taking "splash" off i have the x server error back
[06:43] <john64> lumpki: i have it and the dvd, thanks though
[06:43] <DarkED> okay, ill rephrase my question
[06:43] <nothing> enough nothing's!!

[06:43] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: With the "vga"
[06:43] <newbuntu> is there a setting in xine or vlc for tv-out signal of movies?
[06:43] <levander> Anybody know how to upgrade a kernel on a machine that's not booting?  Can I do it with the LiveCD?
[06:44] <DarkED> in the livecd, can i use gparted during install to resize my ntfs partition to make space for an ext3 for ubuntu?
[06:44] <Kingsqueak> levander: I might be wrong, maybe I updated since the initial upgrade to edgy
[06:44] <stormy|> jrib: I don't know... lol that's why i'm trying to run this specific one
[06:44] <john64> darked: it should be able to
[06:44] <noodles13> what is a good vnc program to use?
[06:44] <john64> i am pretty sure there is an ntfs resizer that you can use
[06:44] <coldfire> howdy all .. i have the alc850 chipset (sound) and am having trouble trying to point a lot of my applications to the spdif (optical) output ... everything wants to go to the headphone jack.  can anyone point me in the right direction?
[06:44] <levander> DarkED: Last I checked (a year ago) parted didn't support ntfs
[06:44] <john64> vncviewer?
[06:44] <levander> DarkED: check the parted manual on gnu's site somewhere
[06:44] <DarkED> levander: yeah i thought so
[06:45] <VigoFusion> tehuti: I am a totall linux newb, I am just relaying data that has worked for me. I mistakenly downloaded some KDE stuff, and some of it worked, some didnt, that is what Backups are for.
[06:45] <levander> DarkED: it's possible they've added support since I checked, I'd check the manual, that info should be easy to find
[06:45] <DarkED> levander: yeah, thanks, ill do that
[06:45] <john64> darked: there is a way to resize ntfs partitions iirc
[06:45] <klp_> is there a package for all mplayer codecs ?
[06:45] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: so do you have a term?  also does this machine have internet, ok?
[06:46] <jrib> stormy|: 'which blender' is a command
[06:46] <DarkED> john64: the only what i know of is to use partition magic - a yucky pay software - or partition logic - a free software, which im not sure i trust :D
[06:46] <stormy|> jrib: /usr/bin/blender
[06:46] <ajopaul_> any ways to move grub from my mbr to the partition where ubuntu is installed, i have a dual boot and i want to have a 3rdparty bootloader on my mbr????
[06:46] <john64> there is an ntfs resizer on the live cd
[06:46] <tehuti> thanks VigoFusion glad you like Linux. looks like this'll require a manual file fix. system backups are for wussies.
[06:46] <TheCarl> How do I delete all partions?
[06:46] <jrib> stormy|: for your conflicing packages, try removing them.  Then reinstalling.  Nothing seems essential anyway
[06:47] <|rt|> you can use qtparted or gparted to resize an ntfs volume
[06:47] <stormy|> jrib: I need to move it to /home/stormy/blender/blender
[06:47] <john64> is there a way to ask the kernel to move stuff from the swap into main memory?
[06:47] <|rt|> as long as it's defragged and has all it's data towards the front of the volume
[06:47] <VigoFusion> ehhe,,RTFM and Back it Up are the first 2 rules.
[06:47] <jrib> stormy|: just type '/home/stormy/blender/blender'
[06:47] <timthelion> hey,I have set up samba to the point where the windows box sees the printer
[06:47] <DarkED> |rt| yeah thats not gonna happen :D
[06:47] <timthelion> but when I try to print, it can't do so
[06:47] <john64> cause once i start using the swap, the memory never leaves it
[06:48] <stormy|> jrib: bash: /home/stormy/blender/blender: is a directory
[06:48] <timthelion> no errors, no nothing
[06:48] <|rt|> DarkED: why is that?
[06:48] <kelbizzle> Hey guys If I install php5 will I have support for php4?
[06:48] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: goto private chat
[06:48] <jrib> stormy|: then that's not what you want
[06:48] <jrib> stormy|: is there /home/stormy/blender/blender/bin/blender maybe?
[06:48] <DarkED> |rt| because number one this is a 60gig which has 50gig full and i dont have all night, i need this ubuntu up and running. number two, i cant boot into windows to run defrag
[06:49] <john64> darked: the installer can resize ntfs partitions
[06:49] <e3> my ATI driver isnt taking... fglrxinfo says im still using MESA... so i beg of you all... please get this mesa off my computer....
[06:49] <john64> http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfsresize.html
[06:49] <DarkED> john64: yes but what is the risk it will make the partition unreadable?
[06:49] <john64> read that link
[06:50] <e3> should i blacklist mesa, will that revert to ati?
[06:50] <john64> gparted supports it
[06:50] <Kingsqueak> DarkED: do a backup, I've had it work on many and fail on a few
[06:51] <Kingsqueak> DarkED: generally it screws up the Win mbr so you'll need Win install media to fix that.  I haven't had full data loss, but it's annoying.
[06:51] <Juhaz> you don't need to get mesa off your computer. you need to get the stupid ati drivers to work, mesa is a software fallback when they don't
[06:51] <stormy|> jrib: now to the problem i get with the packaged blender: ERROR: Unable to open Blender window
[06:51] <VigoFusion> gparted worked fine on my NTFS
[06:51] <e3> anyone know if mesa does opengl on ati radion cards? if it does, i need to get it working. if not, why does it exist if it doesnt support popular cards?
[06:51] <john64> e3: whcih card>
[06:51] <e3> ATI Radeon x700 pro (pci express)
[06:51] <vtoart> My need help (
[06:51] <john64> it exists because there is a world beyond ATI
[06:51] <jrib> stormy|: I would give up on your compiled version and instead see if the ubuntu version works
[06:51] <john64> the x700 required the ati driver
[06:51] <|rt|> VigoFusion: i've used gparted to resize many ntfs volumes....never had any problems with it
[06:52] <john64> check out http://wiki.cchtml.com
[06:52] <john64> follow the guide for your os
[06:52] <stormy|> jrib: the ubuntu version does the same thing.
[06:52] <e3> my x700 wants its precious ati driver but MESA wont die, it just wont die.
[06:52] <lumpki> whenever you resize any partitions, it's a Good Idea to make a backup
[06:52] <john64> ????
[06:52] <|rt|> VigoFusion: used it to resize my ntfs volumes on my xp64 box here at home b/c I didn't want to buy partition magic
[06:52] <john64> what are you talking about?
[06:52] <john64> mesa dying?
[06:52] <repartad> Question here. I bought a USB portable drive.
[06:52] <john64> and that is quite the tone to be using
[06:52] <repartad> Will Ubuntu recognize it as a drive?
[06:52] <john64> yes
[06:53] <jrib> stormy|: was that the original error you got as well before you started manually installing things?
[06:53] <john64> repartad: yes
[06:53] <repartad> yes 2 my q?
[06:53] <vtoart> Anybody here&
[06:53] <e3> i keep installing ati but fglrxinfo keeps saying MESA
[06:53] <repartad> Ah ok.
[06:53] <vtoart> ?
[06:53] <stormy|> jrib:  yes
[06:53] <john64> e3: that isn't that it isn't working, it is that YOU aren't working
[06:53] <repartad> john64, if you are wrong. I'll have your throat.
[06:53] <john64> have you got e3?
[06:53] <john64> :D
[06:53] <john64> ok?  how?
[06:53] <jrib> stormy|: is that the complete error?
[06:53] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: I need you to know if you can boot your machine to a point where you have a working console and internet
[06:53] <stormy|> jrib:  Yes.
[06:53] <repartad> I'm getting pageflipping on dvdplayback
[06:54] <repartad> why is this?
[06:54] <john64> btw e3: you are an ass

[07:00] <ArrenLex> DarkED: All the more reason to run Linux!
[07:00] <DarkED> and Compaq... they told me "sorry, your laptop is too old to be covered under our Windows XP disc warranty, you'll have to buy a new disc"
[07:00] <john64> DarkED: gparted supports this
[07:00] <DiscoStu> is it true, that MergedFB only supports 2 screens of the same size?
[07:00] <john64> the live cd installer supports this as 99% of users use this functionality
[07:01] <DarkED> john64: i heard you, sorry dude, dont mean to be rude just have alot of stuff going on...
[07:01] <DarkED> john64: and thanks
[07:01] <john64> np
[07:01] <john64> DarkED: maybe you can download an OEM disc, with your legit key, everything should be honky-dory
[07:02] <ArrenLex> DarkED: what problems are you having? Just curious.
[07:02] <coz_> DarkED, which part of the world are you in/
[07:02] <arash> im making a makefile for a school assignment. how do i prevent anything being sent to standard output?
[07:02] <vtoart> hey... I'h a trable network... any body help?
[07:02] <jrib> arash: redirect it to /dev/null
[07:02] <DarkED> john64: i could but its too much trouble, i dont have an oem anyways, this laptop came with xp professional and i dont want any unneccessary cracks/hacks in my xp iso
[07:02] <arash> is that the only way?
[07:03] <DarkED> or slipstreams, those suck as well
[07:03] <arash> and will EVERY unix machine have /dev/hull?
[07:03] <john64> darked: i hear ya
[07:03] <john64> msdn is my saviour
[07:03] <DarkED> lol
[07:03] <coz_> DarkED, your nic registered?
[07:03] <DarkED> oooh yes
[07:03] <DarkED> the ubuntu disc is done
[07:03] <john64> is there anyway to stop all my partitions from showing up on the places menu?

[07:04] <john64> /dev/null is where all the fun is
[07:04] <Crell> 'ello.  Is there a way to restore a config file to its original package version?
[07:04] <ArrenLex> Crell: you could just reinstall the package.
[07:04] <arash> how do I prevent echo-ing? (Like echo off in a windows bat file)?
[07:05] <Crell> ArrenLex: You mean purge and install?  Hm.  I was hoping for something a bit less destructive.
[07:05] <vtoart> Wow... i know
[07:05] <ArrenLex> Crell: I mean apt-get install --reinstall <package>
[07:05] <arash> i don't want to see the command that is being entered
[07:05] <ArrenLex> Crell: this will recreate all the package's files in-place.
[07:05] <Crell> Ah.  Will that auto-overwrite all config files?
[07:06] <ArrenLex> Crell: it will replace all files in the package with default versions from the package.
[07:06] <Crell> OK.
[07:07] <stormy|> okay jrib, installing the drivers...
[07:07] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: almost done downloading
[07:07] <jrib> stormy|: ok hope it works.  I'm off to sleep
[07:08] <arash> i get permission denied to /dev/hull
[07:08] <w30> john64, if you take them out of fstab they won't  show up but they won't be mounted on boot up either.
[07:08] <ArrenLex> arash: what command are you trying to run?
[07:08] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: download now what?

[07:12] <Crell> Hey, I'm not complaining. :-)
[07:12] <michaelaoash> I solved the wireless problem I had several hours ago.
[07:12] <john64> awesome!
[07:13] <arash> nothing
[07:13] <ArrenLex> arash: Good. Now what's the output of your command with > /dev/null
[07:14] <michaelaoash> Here is the explanation:  I added a third-party repository (trevi) in order to get a new version of flashplayer.  The new repository added wpasupplicant, a wireless security application which somehow fouled up my connection to my home wireless network.  I discovered this by carefully searching /var/log/dpkg.log
[07:14] <dobsonj> pagefault, thanks a bunch, zsnes svn works like a charm :)
[07:14] <irnub> is this the right place to ask questions about ubuntu live cd?
[07:14] <ArrenLex> micaelaoash: why not download flashplayer from the macromedia beta site?
[07:14] <john64> likely yes
[07:14] <ArrenLex> irnub: ask away!
[07:15] <mordof> alright, so i just installed ubuntu server, and i was wondering how i would go about taking the dapper cd out of the repos?
[07:15] <michaelaoash> ArrenLex:  you bet I'll do that next time.  The repository approach sounded so easy.
[07:15] <arash> ArrenLex: it still outputs to the screen
[07:15] <irnub> ok :)  a realy noob question but here goes
[07:15] <ArrenLex> arash: what about 2> /dev/null
[07:15] <levander> Can you upgrade a kernel on a system that doesn't boot anymore, like by using the LiveCD?
[07:15] <ArrenLex> (i.e. with a 2> instead of >)
[07:15] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Mod'ed now what.
[07:15] <irnub> how do i change permission on a folder that's owned by root in a root terminal window, i want to be able to write to it
[07:15] <ArrenLex> levander: if it doesn't boot anymore I think you have bigger problems than an outdated kernel.
[07:15] <mordof> nm i found it
[07:16] <arash> that worked
[07:16] <michaelaoash> the one scary part about the fix was that removing wpasupplicant required removing ubuntu-minimal (which then reinstalled ok, but it sounds scary to remove really fundamental-sounding pieces).
[07:16] <john64> irnub: chmod mode file
[07:16] <arash> why didn't > work?
[07:16] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: sudo echo "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:16] <hackel_> How do I change the locale for a particular user in edgy? (to change UI language, etc.)
[07:16] <john64> where mode is either octal or characters
[07:16] <levander> ArrenLex: it's not booting because of the kernel version
[07:16] <ArrenLex> arash: > means "standard output". 2> means "error output"
[07:16] <john64> on the livecd you shouldn't need this
[07:16] <john64> 2> is aka standard error
[07:16] <arash> ohh LOL im so dumb
[07:16] <levander> ArrenLex: the upgrade process converted everything to udev, but for some reason my kernel didn't get upgraded
[07:16] <ArrenLex> arash: the compiler was printing those warnings to standard error rather than standard out
[07:16] <arash> yeah hehe thanks
[07:16] <arash> (you can tell im a newb)
[07:17] <john64> why don't you want to see compiler warnings?
[07:17] <ArrenLex> arash: many people on here are! Everyone has to start somewhere :)
[07:17] <arash> i am doing it for a school project.
[07:17] <michaelaoash> I guess the only lesson is to avoid third-party repositories and download directly, which is too bad because I like to keep things in the apt system.
[07:17] <irnub> john64 for some reason the live cd didn't mount my drive..i got it mounted with root terminal but i can't write to it now
[07:17] <arash> they want to run make on my class
[07:17] <arash> my class compiles and works fine
[07:17] <arash> so i don't want the warnings outputted
[07:17] <john64> irnub: right-o
[07:17] <ArrenLex> arash: why don't you write code that doesn't generate warnings? :)
[07:18] <john64> good one arrenlex
[07:18] <arash> because the 'warning' should not be a warning
[07:18] <hackel_> Can anyone tell me how to change the language in Edgy?
[07:18] <arash> I am using generics on a class
[07:18] <john64> what warning is it?
[07:18] <john64> oh
[07:18] <arash> i am using generics on JDOM
[07:18] <arash> which doesn't use generics
[07:19] <arash> using java 1.5
[07:19] <john64> oh
[07:19] <Crell> arash: Are you sure you have the right version?
[07:19] <Crell> That would do it.
[07:19] <arash> yes
[07:19] <john64> why do you need stderr surpressed?
[07:19] <arash> because it looks ugly
[07:19] <john64> any other reason?
[07:19] <arash> no
[07:20] <arash> well the warnings are bothering me
[07:20] <john64> that is very interesting
[07:20] <arash> i am doing something like this
[07:20] <Crell> When programming, always set your compiler/interpreter to "extra picky and pedantic" mode, and correct anything it even thinks about telling you.
[07:20] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: it gives me a permission denied
[07:20] <Crell> It WILL save you time in the long run with more robust code.
[07:20] <arash> List<Element> l = root.getChildren();
[07:20] <arash> it says we cannot expect root.getChildren() to return list
[07:20] <arash> i mean return Element
[07:21] <john64> *well
[07:21] <arash> even though root.getChildren() will ALWAYS return a Element
[07:21] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: you prefixed with sudo, right?
[07:21] <Crell> arash: Is it declared to have that as its return type?
[07:21] <john64> always,  what if you have a badalloc ;)
[07:21] <kurisutofuaa> yup
[07:21] <arash> yes
[07:21] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: yup
[07:21] <john64> for sure
[07:22] <Crell> Could there be some polymorphism involved somewhere?
[07:22] <Flannel> not to stifle the coding conversation, but can you guys move it to ubuntu-offtopic?
[07:22] <Err_> i'm trying to install the wpasupplicant in my /etc/default, but how do I modify it so I can input ENABLE=0 into it?
[07:22] <mhiku>  is there any other way to update kernel without restarting?
[07:22] <john64> no
[07:22] <Err_> i just went into etc/default and did a "touch wpasupplicant", but i don't know how to open it and add a line to it
[07:22] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: then sudo edit the file and add the entry manually if it isn't there
[07:23] <john64> mhiku: restarting is the process where a kernel is loaded
[07:23] <arash> let me look at the JDOM api again
[07:23] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: ko
[07:23] <john64> anyway, i am signing off for now, have a good night all!
[07:23] <ArrenLex> Night!
[07:24] <Err_> i'm following the rules on here: http://www.debianadmin.com/enable-wpa-wireless-access-point-in-ubuntu-linux.html, but i just can't figure out how i can make a wpasupplicant file and add a line to it
[07:24] <Crell> Err_: You need to use a command line text editor.  I suggest nano
[07:24] <Crell> nano /name/of/file
[07:24] <Err_> how should i do it?
[07:24] <arash> how do I prevent echoing in a make file?
[07:24] <arash> (echo off)
[07:24] <arash> sorta thing
[07:25] <Crell> Err_: With nano, as I just said.
[07:25] <Err_> Crell: I just tried to save it and it said permission denied.
[07:25] <Crell> arash: I think #Linux might be a better place for that level of question.
[07:25] <irnub> is chmod used to change folde permissions in ubuntu live cd?
[07:25] <Crell> You need to edit it as root/sudo.
[07:26] <Crell> Try sudo nano /path/to/file
[07:26] <Err_> that worked, thank you very much
[07:26] <Crell> Cheers.
[07:26] <Err_> how do you learn all these commands?
[07:26] <Err_> this is excrutiatingly hard for me
[07:26] <Viscid> does NetworkManager do static IPs yet?
[07:26] <arash> okay
[07:26] <arash> thanks all
[07:27] <repartad> do u have to format new portable drives?
[07:27] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: done what next?
[07:27] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install module-assistant build-essential && sudo apt-get install fakeroot dh-make debhelper debconf libstdc++5 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[07:28] <Crell> repartad: Usually not, depending on the type of drive.
[07:28] <repartad> a seagate.. 100gb
[07:28] <irnub> can somebody give me and exact command that i can use in a root terminal to chance permission on a folder "/home/d" so i can write to it?
[07:29] <Crell> External USB drive?
[07:30] <Crell> irnub: Depends who "I" is on the system and who else you want to be able to read it.
[07:30] <vader1102> irnub, if I knew I would tell you
[07:30] <repartad> Crell, yea. I just tried to copy a 4 gig file to it. Said it didn't have enough space.
[07:30] <repartad> fresh out of the box
[07:31] <irnub> Crell: using ubuntu live cd at the moment and being able to write to it in the root terminal will work fine
[07:31] <arash> why is ubuntu so freaking awesome?
[07:32] <Crell> root can write to anything it damn well feels like.  That's what makes it root. :-)
[07:32] <mordify> Can some one help i have a file with the extention .chm that opens in windows but doesnt in ubuntu. what can i use
[07:32] <irnub> mmm i think i know what the problem is...the folder/partition is ntfs :/
[07:32] <arash> there are a couple of chm viewers
[07:32] <vader1102> that would be it irnub
[07:32] <arash> search chm in synaptic
[07:33] <mordify> cool thanx guys
[07:33] <irnub> Crell: is there a format command i can make it fat32 with?
[07:33] <Crell> repartad: Are you sure it's mounted?
[07:33] <Crell> Yes.  First, make absolutely certain it's not mounted. :-)
[07:33] <tx22> This isn't relevant, but what do you guys think? http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/44012056/
[07:34] <irnub> Crell: ok i will unmount it before i format...if you could give the command please :)
[07:34] <Crell> Then mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1, where sdX1 is the device name you're trying to format.
[07:34] <Crell> Make sure you have the right one. :-)
[07:35] <Crell> Actually, correction.
[07:35] <ArrenLex> tx22: you're right, it's not relevant, although the art is amazing -- but #ubuntu-offtopic is a better place for it.
[07:35] <Crell> mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdX1
[07:35] <irnub> Crell: i know exactly which one it is :)  thanks alot
[07:35] <bitflip> man fltk-config
[07:35] <Crell> Pay it forward. :-)
[07:35] <tx22> ArrenLex:  thanks.. p.s. I just finished making it :)
[07:35] <ArrenLex> !seen Madpilot
[07:35] <ubotu> I last saw Madpilot (n=brian@ubuntu/member/madpilot) 6m 4s ago, quiting: "http://www.warbard.ca/temp/CthulhubuntuLogo.png"
[07:36] <Err_> i followed all the instructions at http://www.debianadmin.com/enable-wpa-wireless-access-point-in-ubuntu-linux.html, but when i go to my wireless manager in the top right and try to add a new connection, i don't get 'WPA Personal' in the drop down list
[07:36] <Crell> I'm afraid I know next to nothing about wireless.
[07:37] <Err_> where's a good place to read up on operating terminal and ubuntu commands?
[07:37] <irnub> Crell: that did the trick :)
[07:37] <ArrenLex> !bash | Err_
[07:37] <ubotu> Err_: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[07:38] <Crell> Err_: You mean the command line?
[07:38] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: okay did that
[07:38] <Crell> What ArrenLex said. :-)
[07:38] <Err_> yesm
[07:38] <irnub> Crell yes the formal command...i can now write to the partition/folder in question
[07:39] <progek> Hi room, anyone know if I can type something in terminal to bring up the log out/restart/shutdown menu?
[07:39] <Crell> yay
[07:39] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: What next?
[07:39] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: sudo ln -sf bash /bin/sh && bash ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/edgy && sudo ln -sf dash /bin/sh
[07:40] <vader1102> progek, I allways use sudo /sbin/shutdown -h or r now. This will halt the system or reboot -h is halt -r is reboot
[07:40] <progek> thanks vader
[07:40] <ArrenLex> bitflip: WTF? All you need is "bash ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run" if it's a shell script.
[07:40] <MrKeuner> !help
[07:40] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[07:40] <vader1102> progek, np
[07:40] <ArrenLex> Or whatever that command was.
[07:40] <ArrenLex> bash ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/edgy
[07:41] <bitflip> ArrenLex: sure about that...You might want to double check what ubuntu actually uses for /bin/sh
[07:41] <bitflip> ArrenLex: versus what the script actually expects
[07:42] <ArrenLex> bitflip: it doesn't matter what ubuntu uses for /bin/sh. If you execute something as "bash script.sh" it will run with bash, and if you run it with "ksh script.sh" it will run with ksh, etc, regardless of what the script expects or says.
[07:42] <ArrenLex> Or what /bin/sh is.
[07:42] <bitflip> ArrenLex: well, put this way - if you don't do it - the script dies horribly
[07:43] <ArrenLex> bitflip: Shouldn't.
[07:43] <bitflip> ArrenLex: I'm not arguing theory with you, only practice
[07:43] <msoul> I have had this problem before and forgot how to fix it, trying to install ubuntu on my toshiba and I can't see anything except blackscreen
[07:43] <bitflip> ArrenLex: read as, I agree with you but it is what it is
[07:43] <slew> hi, browsing seems really slow, im using swiftfox and it seems really laggy. is there anything i can do?
[07:43] <msoul> any idea how to fix this_
[07:44] <Aura> sadasd
[07:44] <vader1102> is there any old server people in here? I am trying to get any version of Linux on my old p1 200 server, the problem I am getting is any newer kernel I get a kernel panic after it finds the compressed image on the disk and then it is froze.... any thoughts would be great. I have used the following commands to try and move it passed this but nothing has helped. noapic noalpic noagp pci-bios
[07:44] <vader1102> dual p1 200 sorry
[07:44] <ArrenLex> vader1102: for really old computers, try Damn Small Linux, Feather Linux, Vector Linux... one of the light distros.
[07:45] <vader1102> ArrenLex, ok, will they see the RAID card?
[07:45] <DARKGuy> I'm trying to set up apache on my local comp for sharing files to friends when they can't download from somewhere and such. How would I go into making apache2 give public access to the outside world?
[07:45] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Error: need root permission or the 'fakeroot' package installed
[07:45] <msoul> how can I re-configure X?
[07:46] <DARKGuy> msoul: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:46] <msoul> darkguy thanks, I will try and see since all I got now is console mode
[07:46] <DARKGuy> msoul: Ah, good luck there :)
[07:46] <ArrenLex> vader1102: Hell if I know.
[07:47] <vader1102> ArrenLex, oki thanx
[07:47] <ArrenLex> kurisutofuaa: sudo ln -sf bash /bin/sh && sudo bash ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/edgy && sudo ln -sf dash /bin/sh
[07:47] <ArrenLex> bitflip: you're right, it DOES crash. That's so weird.
[07:47] <bitflip> ArrenLex: insane, isn't it
[07:48] <ArrenLex> bitflip: /bin/sh must be HARDCODED into the package or something...
[07:48] <bitflip> ArrenLex: bingo - beauty of closed source
[07:48] <DARKGuy> Nobody knows?
[07:48] <ArrenLex> bitflip: I have long been of the opinion that ATI's Linux drivers were coded by a blindfolded intern typing into notepad as part of a hazing process, and released as a Linux driver as soon as it compiled.
[07:48] <slew> hi, browsing seems really slow, im using swiftfox and it seems really laggy. is there anything i can do?
[07:49] <ArrenLex> slew: Is your computer slow?
[07:49] <bitflip> ArrenLex: now that is funny
[07:49] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: still giving me this [Error: need root permission or the 'fakeroot' package installed]  when I run that
[07:49] <slew> ArrenLex, no, not really. 2.31 ghz celey / 512 m ram
[07:49] <MrKeuner> hi, how safe is to enable proposed updates and backport updates in edgy?
[07:49] <ArrenLex> kurisutofuaa: sudo ln -sf bash /bin/sh && sudo bash ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/edgy && sudo ln -sf dash /bin/sh
[07:50] <ArrenLex> slew: is anything else slow?
[07:50] <slew> ArrenLex, so far, no
[07:50] <MrKeuner> will I be in SID mode if I enable proposed updates and backport updates in edgy?
[07:50] <ArrenLex> slew: why are we using swiftfox? Do we like restrictive licenses so much? You shouldn't notice a difference on a modern machine.
[07:50] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: curios - sudo apt-get install fakeroot
[07:51] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: then rerun the command that is failing
[07:51] <slew> ArrenLex, well also thunderbird is fetching mail slowly now that i notice it
[07:51] <ArrenLex> bitflip: easier to just add sudo to the middle command in that chain.
[07:51] <Err_> how do i check what driver my network card has?
[07:53] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Okay did that now it ran but a new error [make: dh_testdir: Command not found]  [make: *** [configure]  Error 127] 
[07:54] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: I think the computer gods are mad at me lol one error after another
[07:55] <slew> ArrenLex, i got opera browser and its slow and now giving me 404s =[ any ideas?
[07:56] <Aura> help me
[07:56] <ArrenLex> slew: how good is your connection?
[07:56] <chalcedony> does anyone use Audacity sound editor? i'm having problems with it

[07:56] <mordof> it beeps loudly and people are asleep!
[07:56] <mordof> lol
[07:56] <slew> ArrenLex, as in speed? 1.5mbps
[07:56] <Crell> mordof: You get those too, huh?
[07:56] <mordof> Crell: yeah :S
[07:56] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: sudo apt-get install dh-make then go for it again
[07:57] <Crell> I was wondering what it was.
[07:57] <druke> For some reason I the program in syste->admin wont change my changes to sessions, nor will it save them to user groups. Its there whenever i move about the program but as soon as i 'close' the changes are lost
[07:57] <mordof> it's lack of a sound card/sound drivers
[07:57] <mordof> so it uses that for system beeps
[07:57] <mordof> but i want to turn it off!! >.<
[07:57] <Crell> I have onboard sound on this motherboard, but I still don't need it to beep.
[07:57] <MrKeuner> is there a reason that I should not feel safe after turning on edgy backports and edgy-proposed?
[07:57] <Aura> where download mp3 for ubuntu or kubuntu
[07:58] <DARKGuy> !mp3 > Aura
[07:58] <Crell> MrKeuner: Because the InterWeb is a dangerous place no matter what you do.
[07:58] <bitflip> so sad, snowed in for two days right into the weekend and I bet I still don't get code written in time for Monday.
[07:58] <Aura> heeelp

[08:21] <mordof> can anyone point me to a link or maybe help me out to be able to ssh into my server?
[08:21] <bitflip> mordof: are you running sshd on the server?
[08:21] <Crell> mordof: Have you installed openssh?
[08:22] <mordof> erm.. which one is better?
[08:24] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: module-assistant, error message: You are not root and no replacement directory (the -u option) is specified. Unable to continue.
[08:24] <bitflip> mordof: openssh, my question is if you had the daemon running, but Crell makes more sense with the basics - do you have anything installed
[08:24] <mlinton> can someone help me with a grub problem and dual boot with XP?
[08:24] <Crell> The openssh package is what provides the ssh server daemon.
[08:25] <Crell> aptitude install openssh
[08:25] <Crell> That should be all you need to do.
[08:25] <ArrenLex> !someone | mlinton
[08:25] <mordof> bitflip: i don't really know where to start this is my first server install, and still being relatively new to linux, this entire no gui thing is proving difficult :P
[08:25] <ubotu> mlinton: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:25] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: did you fatfinger a password entry?  If not, break each command at the "&&" and tell me which one it died on
[08:25] <mordof> Crell: k
[08:25] <mlinton> My issue is that my grub installation doesn't boot XP now, it just reboots the computer.
[08:25] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: okay
[08:25] <mlinton> Can I post my menu.lst herE?
[08:25] <Crell> !pastebin
[08:25] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:25] <ArrenLex> mlinton: do you mean it ALWAYS reboots your computer, or it reboots your computer if you try to boot XP?
[08:26] <mlinton> only when I try to boot XP (hd0,0)
[08:26] <mlinton> but ubuntu boots find (hd0,1)
[08:26] <mlinton> fine
[08:26] <ArrenLex> Sure, pastebin it.

[08:36] <ArrenLex> r_rehashed: d) we ARE talking about graphics chips, right?
[08:36] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: IT WORKS
[08:36] <ArrenLex> TiG4-Laptop: go into /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment the cd-rom line.
[08:36] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: :P
[08:36] <mordof> alright, i've got everything else set up.. any chance anyone knows off-hand how to set a static IP on a server install?
[08:37] <kurisutofuaa> bitflip: Now we need to make a guide for this some time
[08:37] <TiG4-Laptop> ArrenLex, Lol, well that was easy. Thanks bud.
[08:38] <ArrenLex> TiG4-Laptop: easy is good. :)
[08:38] <TiG4-Laptop> ArrenLex, Indeed. :P
[08:38] <ArrenLex> uncomment -> comment, just realised
[08:38] <ArrenLex> But you understood.
[08:38] <bitflip> heh
[08:39] <mlinton> anyone helpout with the grub issue?
[08:40] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: curious - does your splash screen gunk up in black in white or is it in color without artifacts?
[08:41] <bitflip> kurisutofuaa: some ati x86_64's won't display splash correctly...not a big deal to me but curious
[08:43] <Flannel> mlinton: is sdc1 (where the grub comment mentions windows to be) really 0,0? in your bios? or have you since moved/tweaked/etc your hardware
[08:43] <mlinton> let me see...
[08:43] <mlinton> how can I tell?
[08:44] <r_rehashed> ArrenLex: yeah I need the drivers for intel's integrated graphics card, which is the intel xtreme 3000
[08:44] <Flannel> mlinton: check your BIOS
[08:44] <mlinton> ok, I know what the bios states.  The disk I'm trying to boot from is the first sata disk on the nvidia array
[08:44] <r_rehashed> ArrenLex: the motherboard model no. is 946GZ-I, I guess
[08:44] <mlinton> so it's probably been changed since it was sdc
[08:45] <mlinton> probably sda now
[08:45] <mlinton> but how could the other grub options work and xp not.  If it was really borked wouldn't all of the boot options be broken?
[08:46] <ArrenLex> mlinton: Hmm. pastebin the output of "sudo fdisk -l"
[08:46] <Flannel> mlinton: it'd be a windows specific issue, not a grub issue. try changing root to rootnoverify
[08:47] <Flannel> mlinton: well, it could be a grub issue as in not finding the windows drive, or whatnot.  But, it's not a global grub issue
[08:47] <mlinton> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35069/plain/
[08:47] <ArrenLex> *blink*
[08:48] <ArrenLex> Yeah, that's so beyond me.
[08:48] <mlinton> sdc1
[08:48] <Raskall> yay. Seems 64 bit Edgy works a lot better than 64 bit dapper.
[08:48] <mlinton> is the XP install disk
[08:48] <Flannel> mlinton: Windows is NOT the first partition.  You need 2,0 and then you'll need to use a pair of maps
[08:48] <mlinton> explain... please
[08:49] <r_rehashed> ArrenLex: thanks for the link. I found my way. :)
[08:49] <Flannel> map (hd0) (hd2) \n map (hd2) (hd0)
[08:49] <mlinton> in the menu.lst right?
[08:49] <ArrenLex> r_rehashed: glad I accidentally helped you! xD
[08:50] <Flannel> on your windows thing
[08:50] <mlinton> before or after the root command?
[08:51] <mlinton> Flannel: thanks btw - saving my bacon
[08:51] <bitflip> so 850+ people...Who uses vi to edit their ~/.emacs?
[08:52] <Flannel> mlinton: before the root, and I suppose that means you don't need to change the root line
[08:52] <mlinton> cool let me try it...
[08:53] <ArrenLex> bitflip: the same people who take diet soda and large fries. :)
[08:53] <bitflip> ArrenLex: excellent point!

[09:11] <eyequeue> Raskall, system > administration > preferences

[09:12] <repartad> I think. or administration
[09:12] <r_rehashed> ArrenLex: so will the drivers for Debian 3.1 work fine on ubuntu?
[09:13] <Raskall> eyequeue: it's not there. would you mind checking the shortcut for me, so that I can start it from the command line?
[09:13] <defrysk> r_rehashed, unlikely

[09:15] <repartad> Raskall: you arent missing anything

[09:15] <eyequeue> Raskall, alt-f2    gnome-screensaver-preferences
[09:15] <repartad> You might as well just turn your monitor off.
[09:16] <Raskall> repartad: yes, I am missing the opportunity to disable GL screensavers
[09:16] <SF100> i cannot get to the install files from a terminal window or a root terminal window

[09:37] <printk> eloquence_: does lspci or dmesg list it?  If not contact your computer manufactorer? :))
[09:37] <mdious> printk>Thanks for the ~, i didn't know about that :)
[09:37] <printk> mdious: np :)
[09:38] <mdious> printk:  thanks for the lspci, I had forgotten about that one :)
[09:38] <printk> heh
[09:38] <eloquence_> lspci lists a bunch of stuff
[09:38] <eloquence_> but nothing specific
[09:38] <eloquence_> intel stuff
[09:39] <eloquence_> i am looking thru dmesg now
[09:39] <printk> eloquence_: doesn't list like Intel Pro 2100 or 2200 ?
[09:39] <SF100> printk: i dont know what im doing wrong but i cant get there still
[09:40] <eloquence_> in lspci?
[09:40] <eloquence_> no
[09:40] <eloquence_> even though i was able to connect thru wireless as a default device
[09:40] <eloquence_> no device info
[09:40] <repartad> so, about 4 days ago.. one of my molars was being pushed up.. like it was lose and hurting terribly. I couldn't even TOUCH it it was so bad.
[09:41] <repartad> Now, its perfectly fine
[09:41] <Raskall> mdious: yup. it needs to be "activated". :)
[09:41] <printk> SF100: are you able to cd ~<your_username_here>/Desktop atleast?
[09:41] <eloquence_> even in ubuntu's device manager ... manufacturer unknown
[09:41] <repartad> it like sunk back down.
[09:41] <repartad> odd?
[09:41] <printk> eloquence_: shrugs sorry man
[09:41] <eloquence_> damn
[09:41] <repartad> I prayed to god to make the pain go away because it was so bad.
[09:41] <repartad> very very odd.
[09:41] <raghu206> how to set data source name in oracle ..:?
[09:41] <printk> eloquence_: if you can find out what it actually is you can make linux recongnize it... just need to know for sure what you have
[09:42] <mdious> printk>you don't need to put the username in correct...or is that just there for reference?
[09:42] <sindrum> SF100: try doing sudo -i
[09:42] <eloquence_> how do i find out what it is thru linux atr the same time that linux doesn't know what it is
[09:42] <printk> oh youre right don't need the username if it is YOUR home dir
[09:42] <sindrum> SF100: then do cd /
[09:42] <sindrum> SF100: then do ls
[09:42] <eloquence_> u must forgive me i am fairly new to linux ... last time i was on it was like 5 years ago
[09:42] <printk> but say you're loggged in as user1 and you want to go to user2 you'd type cd ~user2
[09:42] <eloquence_> no ... more
[09:42] <printk> if you are user1 and want to go to your own you can just use ~ by it self
[09:43] <sindrum> SF100: hows that going?
[09:43] <SF100> printk: it says "no such file or directory"

[10:39] <skiZZZ> eloquence_, pastebin the output of ifconfig -a for a start
[10:39] <diskus> eloquence_: try runing 'lspci'
[10:39] <eloquence_> and based on the description of the HP Pavillion dv8000t laptop it says i should have an intel 3945
[10:39] <eloquence_> http://pastebin.ca/264360 here is an lspci and dmesg
[10:39] <diskus> and check ifconfig -a as skiZZZ said or dmesg after reboot
[10:39] <kurisutofuaa> How do I check if my video card supports 3D in ubuntu-Edgy64?
[10:40] <diskus> it's laptop?
[10:40] <eloquence_> yea
[10:40] <Kishore> Hi all
[10:40] <dade`> how do i use the debug kernel image ?
[10:40] <eloquence_> for some reason it isn't reading any eth1 device
[10:40] <eloquence_> i think i am really ifconfig -ascrewed nowq
[10:40] <eloquence_> now*
[10:40] <graveson> eloquence : my dapper crashed due to hardware failure, and i had to switch to windows as i upraded my pc to core 2 duo . I found out after that Dapper will not work. So i downloaded Edgy and i hope it will firstly install onto my Core 2 duo and also not mess up my windows install so i can recover the data
[10:41] <eloquence_> i am running dapper on a core duo
[10:41] <skiZZZ> eloquence_, when i first got my hands onthis laptop on tuesday, sound ethernet and wifi were all blanks
[10:41] <eloquence_> so u might need a 64bit one for core 2
[10:41] <eloquence_> ok cool skizz
[10:41] <eloquence_> to tell u the truth skizz
[10:41] <skiZZZ> on weds they all worked
[10:41] <eloquence_> until last night i was using wireless
[10:42] <eloquence_> but last night i tried to install a broadcom driver since sum1 said i have a broadcom and it disappeared
[10:42] <eloquence_> in the terminal window it says there are currenty drivers that seem to work do i wanna override
[10:42] <eloquence_> and i di
[10:42] <eloquence_> but i never rebooted
[10:42] <diskus> eloquence_: can you give me model number of your laptop?
[10:42] <diskus> eloquence_: it's easier to google what hardware you have in it
[10:42] <eloquence_> my laptop battery died while i was asleep ( i forgot to plug the cord in)
[10:42] <eloquence_> and i woke up this morning to a dead lappie
[10:42] <eloquence_> HP dv8000t
[10:44] <diskus> seems like Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network w/Bluetooth
[10:45] <eloquence_> yea
[10:45] <graveson> eloquence: i believe there is a difference between core duo and core 2 duo
[10:45] <kurisutofuaa> How do I check if my video card supports 3D in ubuntu-Edgyamd64?
[10:46] <s1`_> do you have an ati o nvidia?
[10:46] <eloquence_> yea graveson
[10:46] <eloquence_> core 2 duo is 64 bit
[10:46] <kurisutofuaa> ATI
[10:46] <eloquence_> u just gotta get a 64bit os
[10:46] <eloquence_> i have nvidia sl if that question was for me
[10:47] <diskus> eloquence_: you could try loading modprobe ipw3945, and checking if it's recognized
[10:47] <graveson> eloquence: will the desktop version of edgy not work then ? :(
[10:47] <eloquence_> i am not sure grave
[10:47] <eloquence_> i have core duo
[10:47] <First|Laptop> eloquence_: You don't need a 64 bit OS just because the chip supports it.
[10:47] <eloquence_> but from what i been reading
[10:47] <eloquence_> if u have a 64 bit proc u gotta install a 64bit os
[10:47] <diskus> no need 64-bit at all
[10:47] <eloquence_> oh ok
[10:47] <eloquence_> i see then
[10:48] <eloquence_> cool
[10:48] <s1`_> kurisutofuaa, check on ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=423584
[10:48] <First|Laptop> I have two 64 bit chips running 32 bit ubuntu
[10:48] <axisys> anyone here can tell how to install soundwrapper? sorry for the reapeat question
[10:48] <DarkED> Hi all, is it possible to install ubuntu FROM a usb drive such as a PSP or thumbdrive?
[10:48] <diskus> it's even easier if you run 32-bit ubuntu on amd64 hardware
[10:49] <DarkED> For some reason, I cannot write the CD correctly (after six attempts now) and I'm tired of burning coasters
[10:50] <diskus> DarkED: that's why I use cd-rw :P
[10:50] <mathieu_> DarkED: you can install linux using pretty much any media, but cd is probably the easiest way
[10:51] <YBH_1> Darked, yes copy the iso to the USB drive and mount using the mount -loop option. Do a google search.
[10:52] <mathieu_> diskus: assuming you can boot into a unix system
[10:52] <diskus> mathieu_: yeah
[10:52] <DarkED> Hmm, and also, if the LiveCD part of the disc will not work, is it possible that the text-based installer will work?
[10:53] <mathieu_> diskus: sorry that was for darked
[10:53] <diskus> mathieu_: :P
[10:53] <shaym> hello
[10:53] <theAdib> hello does Ubuntu support my laptop AC97 Modem ? 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Modem Controller. WHich device will it be ?
[10:53] <shaym> i look for someone who have a toshiba satellite M70
[10:53] <shaym> to get some configuration files
[10:54] <DarkED> YBH_1: And doing this I won't have to use internet/network to complete the install?
[10:54] <enyc> theAdib: hrrm ac97 audio an that sounds like the i810-audio driver... but that is not modem part of it
[10:54] <DarkED> Um, nope I can't boot into a unix system
[10:54] <DarkED> So, guess I'm stuck..
[10:55] <eloquence_> i did modprobe ipw3945 nothing happened
[10:55] <eloquence_> diskus, any ideas?
=== yama_away is now known as yama
[10:55] <enyc> theAdib: I think the answer really is... that is not a real model as such... its all software controlled whatnot. I know there are _some_ linux modelos for these 'winwodem' like units...
[10:55] <diskus> eloquence_: nope, but myself I would reinstall my laptop to be sure
[10:56] <diskus> eloquence_: http://cepes.org.pe/jaime/dv8000t.html read this, it's for Fedora Core 5 but you can maybe get something out of it
[10:56] <shaym> i want to create a master access point, ihave a ipw2200
[10:56] <shaym> the master option is not recognized
[10:57] <DarkED> Hmm, guess it probably WONT work in text mode either, considering the corrupted file is filesystem.squashfs and that is the file with all the install packages lol
[10:57] <astroboy> What about the fiskus ?
[10:58] <graveson> i hope edgy will solve my issue - windows is giving me a headache as i cannot control what it does
[10:58] <eloquence_> reinstall ubuntu diskus?

[10:58] <phisquare> Hi guys, I want to set up my computer to be a linux file server right now and also run myth tv with an ati tv tuner card.  The file server needs to be windows accessable
[10:59] <phisquare> I want subversion access on this box too and remote vnc access as well
[10:59] <phisquare> Can this be done with edgy?
[10:59] <kraut> moin
[10:59] <enyc> theAdib: read on http://www.linmodems.org/ for general info
[11:00] <enyc> theAdib: im sure there are some wiki.ubuntu.com pages with ubuntu-specifigc info.
[11:00] <theAdib> phisquare: samba is your friend, windows fileserver
[11:00] <theAdib> enyc: ok, I will do
[11:00] <epswing> so i'm considering ubuntu.  first question, 6.10 vs 6.06.  is there some question i can ask and answer myself which would single out which i would want to install?

[11:08] <mkst> where should i put that script?
[11:08] <hastesaver> Hi, I'm trying to do a fresh install of Edgy (upgrade from Dapper). My /home was a separate partition. How do I tell the installer to retain it?
[11:08] <DBO> mkst, /etc/init.d
[11:08] <DBO> mkst, thats a folder
[11:08] <DBO> so like /etc/init.d/iptablesstart
[11:08] <mkst> ok, I know that
[11:09] <DBO> then you would make a link to it in /etc/rc2.d/S74iptablesstart
[11:10] <Kaaroth> hello!!how are you?

[11:14] <hastesaver> in case someone even read my question... nevermind, I figured it out myself :-)
[11:15] <eloquence_> lol hastesaver
[11:15] <eloquence_> that happens so often
[11:16] <abductee> DBO: thanks for the tip
[11:16] <hastesaver> eloquence_: but it's not surprising, lots of people, things tend to go unnoticed, or the right people aren't here at the time... I'm not complaining
[11:16] <eloquence_> yea
[11:16] <eloquence_> no for me
[11:16] <eloquence_> i would say the question like 3 times
[11:16] <eloquence_> each time fearing that i might bother ppl by repeating
[11:16] <eloquence_> but they wouldnt notice
[11:17] <eloquence_> then i crack a few jokes get some attention and ask
[11:17] <eloquence_> lol
[11:17] <eloquence_> try it .. i just exposed my copyrighted techniques
[11:17] <eloquence_> ppl have other things going on
[11:17] <hastesaver> eloquence_: framing questions so as to grab attention and elicit answers is an art, eh? :-)
[11:17] <eloquence_> i am sure the advanced users dont just sit on their irc window and stare off into ppl's complaints and problems
[11:17] <pecisk> how to tell ubuntu version from console?
[11:17] <eloquence_> oh yea its an art
[11:18] <robotgeek> pecisk: lsb-release -a

=== dcordes is now known as ath0_up
[11:18] <eloquence_> bah damn ieee80211
[11:19] <ath0_up> eloquence_: why damn?
[11:19] <|thunder> ALL; is there a way to have apt-get list the packages that are marked for upgrade in the console? I checked the man page, it references the -u option, but I cant get it to do anything, even with update and install. help.
[11:19] <eloquence_> it wont install
[11:20] <eloquence_> http://pastebin.ca/264380
[11:20] <Terminus> |thunder: hmmm... why not `apt-get -s upgrade` ?
[11:21] <|thunder> Terminus; does that download anything ?
[11:21] <hastesaver> |thunder: "-s" is the option for "simulate only". Does it not work, or is too crude a method for your tastes?
[11:21] <Terminus> |thunder: nope.
[11:21] <|thunder> have not tried it.
[11:21] <lazzareth> Hey, I Really Need Help, I need to author a DVD in ubuntu.. I need to get an episode of stargate (.avi) on a dvd to run & work in a dvd player to impress my girls mother! Pretty much will make or break our sex life!?
[11:21] <|thunder> lemme give it a shot and see if it suits my palette
[11:22] <hastesaver> lazzareth: lol. Try qdvdauthor, maybe
[11:22] <defrysk> lazzareth, that pretty easy
[11:22] <|thunder> lazzareth; use ffmpeg or mencoder to conver to mpeg-2.
[11:22] <gavintu> how do I run scripts/text files from console?
[11:22] <defrysk> lazzareth, sudo apt-get install ffmpeg dvdauthor
[11:22] <|thunder> gavintu; put a ./ in fornt of it
[11:22] <Shi> you make them executable thanks to chmod
[11:23] <lazzareth> ok, its installing, Thank you so much you guys!
[11:23] <lazzareth> You know how it is
[11:23] <hastesaver> gavintu: unless you know what you're doing, you shouldn't :-) (But if you do, then it's "./<filename>" or "bash <filename>" or "sh filename", or whatever you prefer)
[11:23] <Shi> and then you run them by typing ./your_script_name
[11:23] <eloquence_> ath0 have u installed it?
[11:23] <defrysk> lazzareth, http://tuxicity.wordpress.com/2006/12/01/avi-to-dvd-with-ffmpeg-and-dvdauthor/
[11:23] <gavintu> hastesaver: I'm not doing anything crazy :  ).
[11:23] <Terminus> hastesaver: bash and sh only works for scripts. ./ is more general. =P
[11:24] <gavintu> hastesaver: but ./ is giving me permission denied, so do I have to make it executable AND use the command?
[11:24] <lazzareth> defrysk, That looks to be it, Thank you so much,
[11:24] <hastesaver> gavintu: do "chmod +x <filename>"
[11:24] <lazzareth> Ill video tape it for you :P
[11:24] <defrysk> lol
[11:24] <tanlaan> Does anyone know of a linux distro that looks/acts/uses the same principles as Mac OS X?
[11:24] <hastesaver> gavintu: chmod = change mode, +x = make executable. The "permission denied" only means that the file is not executable
[11:26] <Alzi2_> <Alzi2_> Hello.
[11:26] <Alzi2_> <Alzi2_> We put the videocard in the PC and only the fan is blowing, we get a blank screen. It is an ATI Radeon 9600 XT and we checked AGP and PCI support
[11:26] <Alzi2_> <Simon80> you can't put it in the wrong one, man, it's either agp or pci
[11:26] <Alzi2_> <Alzi2_> The new video card has longer slots than my old one. That one had shorter ones. While it does fit, my PC doesn't boot.
[11:26] <Alzi2_> <Alzi2_> Please, help...
[11:26] <Alzi2_> Sorry for the paste.
[11:26] <Alzi2_> But I need help
[11:27] <gavintu> hastesaver: OK, got it, thanks!
[11:27] <reverseblade> Alzi2_, this has nothing to do with #ubuntu
[11:27] <tanlaan> try going into bios and then going to exit, then goto set defaults
[11:27] <tanlaan> that may help
[11:27] <tanlaan> *thats what i did for mine*
[11:27] <shaym> i can't set mode master for my ipw2200
[11:27] <tanlaan> i had  a wrong setting somewhere
[11:28] <shaym> should i compile myself the ipw2200 source ?
[11:28] <ath0_up> shaym: wich driver do you use?
[11:28] <hastesaver> tanlaan: you *can* make GNOME (the default Ubuntu desktop) look (somewhat like) OS X. Search the web for "Making GNOME look like OS X" :-) But for those "principles", it's hard to say. Try it and see for yourself.
[11:28] <shaym> from the ubuntu 6.10
[11:28] <tanlaan> hastesaver: well thats not all that i meant/want
[11:29] <tanlaan> hastesaver: what i want is a linux distro that really uses the principles of OS X
[11:29] <eilker> people should i install dhcp or dhcp3 ??? (trying for wmvare server)
[11:29] <hastesaver> tanlaan: and what are those principles?
[11:29] <reverseblade> eilker, #networking ?
[11:29] <tanlaan> hastesaver: as in having everything used most often up front and in plain view and not cluttered
[11:29] <shaym> i want to build a wifi access point on my laptop centrino
[11:29] <tanlaan> hastesaver: most linux distros/programs tend to try and fit the most they can in one space
[11:30] <shaym> i don't have a hardware wifi routeur
[11:30] <tanlaan> hastesaver: i had a great article on it just earlier today, and im trying to find it
[11:30] <shaym> i just want to test my pda wifi via my laptop wifi chipset
[11:30] <shaym> i found a tuto on building custom ipw2200 modules
[11:31] <hastesaver> tanlaan: what you're saying is interesting, but I've got to reboot now... I'm on the Live CD, just finished installing Edgy. gtg :-(
[11:31] <reverseblade> shaym, it is hard hard being a geek is
[11:32] <tanlaan> hastesaver: ok goodbye
[11:34] <shaym> the tuto tells to copy the ipw2.3*.fw to /usr/lib/hotplug
[11:34] <shaym> but the previous directory doesn't exists
[11:35] <ath0_up> you could try putting it into the firmware folder
[11:35] <shaym> ??
[11:36] <tanlaan> if anyone would like to read a pretty good article, and maybe talk to me about it, here is "9 things KDE should learn from Mac OS X" http://www.icefox.net/articles/kdeosx.php
[11:36] <tanlaan> i think its good
[11:36] <tanlaan> and it makes for a pretty good discussion topic

[11:36] <shaym> ok
[11:45] <richard501> anyone know how to setup a server on pen drive?

[11:46] <tanlaan> well i would say...
[11:46] <tanlaan> get a bootable server disk
[11:46] <tanlaan> *install disk
[11:47] <tanlaan> then boot to it, and install it onto the pendrive
[11:47] <_greenie> ive found a rather unique bug when u dual boot windows XP pro and ubuntu 6.10...
[11:47] <tanlaan> then boot to the pendrive
[11:47] <_greenie> u are able to change date/time on windows, but not in ubuntu,,,

[11:57] <dter> Is it possible to 'downgrade' edgy to dapper?
[11:57] <sacater> dter: i doubt it,
[11:57] <bimberi> suston3d: how are you changing the layout?
[11:57] <bimberi> !downgrade
[11:57] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[11:57] <defrysk> dter, anything is possible , if its doable is something else
[11:57] <dter> great
[11:57] <manitsme> I was wondering if anyone knows of a way that I can make a text file listing the names of a file in a directory  with the full path? ie. a mp3 folder with song.mp and it would list it in a text file as /home/user/share/song.mp3  I am trying to make a list generator for  a shoutcast type of deal  thank you
[11:57] <dter> guess ill have to reinstall my system then

[11:58] <dter> I know how to backup.
[11:58] <RoC_MM> !cloning
[11:58] <ubotu> To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type "dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages", move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type "sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade"
[11:58] <dter> Why on earth doesnt edgy support my mouse and dapper did perfectly?
[11:58] <suston3d> i change it with system->Configuration->Keyboard

[11:59] <sogar> Hello, anybody running 6.06 ? I'd like you to check something in a manpage for me...
[12:00] <dter> My wireless usb mouse worked perfectly in dapper, then I updated to edgy and it doesnt work anymore. So as I cannot downgrade it back to dapper, I guess I have to reinstall my system?
[12:00] <eilker> by which command can i learn my dns adresses??
[12:00] <dter> eilker: ifconfig
[12:00] <bimberi> suston3d: perhaps try changing the setting in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:00] <eilker> dter: it is dns
[12:00] <dter> eilker: doesnt ifconfig show dns too?
[12:00] <eilker> dter: no it doesnt
[12:00] <bimberi> dter: cat /etc/resolv.conf
[12:00] <suston3d> the layout is set to "de" -_-"
[12:01] <suston3d> in xorg.conf
[12:01] <dter> bimberi: what does that do?
[12:01] <dter> eilker: ah sorry, I thought so
[12:01] <dkrzakala> And also question.. I have builtin i945G graphic card.. and my 6.06 has driver i810. Is it possible to enable hardware graphic acceleration or install new drivers for i945G?
[12:01] <bimberi> dter: oops, misnick, meant for eilker
[12:01] <sogar> can somebody on 6.06 tell me if they see the -F option in "man shutdown" ? Thank you
[12:01] <suston3d> but im using beryl .. so i think its ignoring the xorg.conf ?? not sure about that
[12:01] <DBO> suston3d, beryl has nothing to do with your xorg.conf, it load WAY after that is read
[12:02] <dter> bimberi: np, can you help me out with my mouse? worked in dapper but not in edgy
[12:02] <eilker> bimberi: i need to learn what isp gives us to use
[12:02] <eilker> bimberi: trying to configure dhcpd.conf here
[12:03] <sogar> hello ?
[12:03] <bimberi> dter: sorry, i'm not sure
[12:03] <suston3d> hmm ... but if the entry is set in the xorg.conf to a german keyboard layout .. way doesnt it work ;(
[12:03] <sogar> can someobdy fucking read what I'm typing ?

[12:03] <we2by> my gnome-panel is scrwed up. it is crashing. I can't use it. how do I fix it??
[12:04] <sogar> Okay if somebody is running 6.06, can you take a look into man shutdown and see if you see option "-F" ?
[12:04] <DBO> sogar, unfortunately not many dapper users here, so you might be waiting a bit...
[12:04] <sogar> Okay, I'll be waiting.. this isn't really an emergency...
[12:04] <we2by> guys?
[12:04] <MegaR0m> hi, are ther any howto's for leadtek tuners on ubuntu ?

[12:06] <jmsbwtr_> hellol, i want to use sound juicer to rip cds to mp3, i have installed lame and gst-ugly but i get error, invalid parameters when trying to rip...
[12:06] <dkrzakala> so anyone here knows how to install intel drivers for i945G? :P
[12:06] <sogar> so -F is present in shutdown on 6.06 ... can you do shutdown -rF now to check if it works ? :)
[12:06] <shaym> in fact, i can't make difference between mode ad-hoc and mode master ?

[12:18] <Fortis> how do I create a new textfile using the commandline?
[12:18] <jerp> jokoon, do you need to find another keyboard setting, if so use System/preferences/Keyboard

[12:23] <huiber1>  Ema: gnome system mmon, works for me :-)
[12:23] <jerp> Ema, the panel applet I have on my screen is "System Monitor"
[12:23] <huiber1> Ema: what is missing?
[12:23] <jokoon> For what kind of CPU the generic kernel is made ?
[12:24] <jerp> ema, right click on the panel and click on add to panel
[12:24] <defrysk> Ema, an nice monitor for you might be gkrellm
[12:24] <huiber1> jokoon: >> 586 AFAIK
[12:24] <defrysk> Ema, its nice eye candy
[12:24] <jerp> near the bottom of the page find "system monitor"
[12:24] <jokoon> so for an old amd athlon 2200+
[12:25] <huiber1> 2200+ is not "old"
[12:25] <Ema> yeah i'd like the one which shows CPU speed, hd temperature and so on
[12:25] <defrysk> jokoon, sudo apt-get install linux-k7
[12:25] <jerp> in the "system & hardware" section
[12:25] <defrysk> Ema, try gkrellm
[12:25] <jokoon> huiber1 at least 3 years is rather old
[12:25] <domek_pieknis> jo
[12:26] <jerp> ema, you might be talking about gdesklets from the synaptic manager

[12:29] <Ema> coool so do i have to try gdesklets?

[12:30] <HumanPrototype> what kernel should I install on a AMD X2 3800 pc?
[12:30] <defrysk> http://amaranth.selfip.com used to have a repository but unfotunatly its closed for now
[12:30] <Ema> apt-get ;-)
[12:30] <defrysk> snedar
[12:30] <bimberi> !nvidiabeta | snedar
[12:30] <ubotu> snedar: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)

[12:32] <eilker> HumanPrototype: thank you so much
[12:32] <bimberi> snedar: a good policy
[12:33] <song> hey, why I cannot establish connection together with ejb and mysql

[12:50] <KenSentMe> needshelp: thats not the latest release, that is called edgy eft, but i don't think there are dvd releases of that
[12:50] <huiber1> abo: oops, I allways thought it was about the capture device.
[12:50] <HumanPrototype> infernux, is there a reason it boots faster?
[12:51] <abo> huiber1, I'm not sure... I know that it used to work perfectly..
[12:51] <eloquence_> bimberi, u there bro?
[12:51] <battlesquid> hello :) i'm trying to backport vim7 to ubuntu 6.06 using this guide: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Backport_VIM7 however step 8) fails with the following (translating from norwegian now): Buildcommand cd vim-7.0 && dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc failed. E: Childprocess failed". And so I can't go on as there are no .deb files in the dir as outlined in 9)
[12:51] <ath0_up> anybody got a logitech gamepad working?
[12:51] <ailean> KenSentMe: there are DVD releases of EdgyEft
[12:51] <infernux> HumanPrototype: I don't know... but I had disabled gdm before also and now re-enabled it. it's like gdm popping up just after grub
[12:51] <Seveas> battlesquid, you can find a readymade backport on seveas.imbrandon.com
[12:51] <KenSentMe> ailean: ok, but i couldn't find them
[12:51] <huiber1> abo: in the shell, start alsamixer
[12:52] <infernux> I just see 2-3 lines with acpi stuff and then gdm comes up and I can log into gnome
[12:52] <huiber1> abo: then use TAB key to switch between playback/capture/all
[12:52] <battlesquid> Seveas, thanks i'll have a look
[12:52] <MegaR0m> anyhow can u help on my tuner issue ?
[12:52] <MegaR0m>  02:09.0 Multimedia video controller: Conexant CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder (rev 05)   thats the card ... howto make a tuner from it ?
[12:52] <ailean> KenSentMe: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/edgy/release/

[12:52] <KenSentMe> ailean: yeah, found em also now
[12:52] <ailean> KenSentMe: k
[12:53] <huiber1> abo: in cature mode, ypu should see the MIC with the word CAPTURE
[12:53] <philiKON> hi, i just logged into my ubuntu 6.10 system for the 3rd or so time, and the top and bottom bars don't show up. the system just sits there with the brown background doing nothing
[12:53] <philiKON> what's wrong?
[12:54] <abo> huiber1, right, I see it, and the level is at the highest
[12:55] <huiber1> abo: have you tried to record some sounds with your mic
[12:55] <abo> ok it's working now
[12:55] <abo> cheers
[12:55] <huiber1> abo: I find the ekiga setup wizzard good for diagnosing mic problems.
[12:55] <huiber1> abo: it's working?
[12:55] <Ema> jerp are you here?
[12:55] <huiber1> abo:  what have you done?
[12:56] <NiklasofVienna> hi
[12:56] <jerp> philc, are the bars set to hide?
[12:56] <Ema> how can I put desklets on gnome panel?
[12:56] <jerp> yes Ema
[12:56] <huiber1> abo: my sister has the same problem atm.
[12:56] <abo> I raised all capture levels :)
[12:56] <huiber1> abo: thats all?
[12:56] <philiKON> jerp: no. at least i didn't change that seting
[12:56] <jerp> philc,  right click dow at the bottom
[12:56] <jerp> down
[12:57] <abo> huiber1, I'm not sure, I've playing around since a while... but the last thing I did was playing around with the alsamixer
[12:57] <Ema> ohhh found them!
[12:57] <Ema> thanks
[12:57] <jerp> emam yeah right click on the bar
[12:57] <philiKON> jerp: hm, that'll be hard, my mac only has one button :/
[12:58] <jerp> phil, sorry I missed it that you were using a mac
[12:58] <huiber1> abo: thanks for the info
[12:58] <philiKON> jerp: it's ok, i didn't say ...
[12:58] <philiKON> problem is, there's no bar at all
[12:58] <philiKON> just that standard orange-brownish screen
[12:59] <philiKON> after providing login name + password
[12:59] <abo> huiber1,I'm sorry it's not very helpfull....
[12:59] <abo> huiber1, I should thank you for helping me
[12:59] <snedar> does logging out restart the X server like CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE does? I'm wring a small tutorial on how to install nvidia drivers, and "Log out" sounds nicer than "Press CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE"
[12:59] <snedar> (in edgy)
[12:59] <Jowi> no snedar
[12:59] <jerp> phil, yeah, I'm on a pc myself
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[01:00] <snedar> Jowi, okay
[01:01] <philiKON> jerp: what's the top bar called in GNOME, so i can at least try to google the problem...
[01:01] <Jowi> snedar, "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" in a terminal is an alternative solution
[01:01] <elkbuntu> philiKON, gnome-panel. the bottom one is a gnome panel as well.
[01:01] <philiKON> ok
[01:01] <philiKON> thx
[01:01] <snedar> Jowi, nah, I'll leave it by CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE, it's a bit shorter :-)
[01:02] <Jowi> philiKON, you can try to create a new user and log in with that one to see if it is user specific
[01:02] <philiKON> good idea
[01:02] <philiKON> what's the best way to do that in ubuntu w/o X11?
[01:02] <philiKON> standard adduser?
[01:02] <Jimmey> I've lost a kernel module :-( After playing about with "module-assistant", I can no longer find the bcm43xx module. How can I get it back?
[01:02] <Jowi> philiKON, yep
[01:02] <philiKON> k
[01:02] <huiber1> philiKON:maybe gnome cannot start be cause it can not accass your sound device,
[01:03] <philiKON> huiber1: hmm, that may be, though it used to work before...
[01:03] <philiKON> this is, as said, the 3rd or 4th time i started
[01:03] <philiKON> and it worked perfectly earlier
[01:03] <huiber1> philiKON: I had that once, because some OSS app was still hanging (crashed) in th ebackground
[01:03] <Minty> is there a automatixeezy ? for br
[01:04] <huiber1> abo:  OSS as in open sound system,
[01:04] <philiKON> hmm, interesting
[01:04] <huiber1> abo: OSS only allows one thread to access sound
[01:04] <abo> huiber1, while alsa allows multiple?
[01:05] <huiber1> abo: yes
[01:05] <abo> huiber1, mmmm... ok thx
[01:05] <huiber1>  philiKON: sorry, yes.
[01:05] <errorlevel> huiber1: I used to be able to use my sound card (SBLive) with more than one app using OSS.
[01:05] <philiKON> huiber1: the problem persists after restats, though
[01:05] <philiKON> restarts
[01:06] <huiber1> errorlevel: this might be, for this pupose daemons like ESD Arts and the like where written
[01:06] <errorlevel> huiber1: I agree, though, in general, it was true.  Although, I think it was on a card-by-card basis.
[01:06] <Jowi> philiKON, same prob with new user?
[01:06] <huiber1> philiKON:the problem should go away after a restart, if it is what I think it is.
[01:06] <philiKON> Jowi: no, a new user can log in
[01:06] <philiKON> just tried
[01:06] <abo> I have a difficulty playing embedded videos, in firefox, and although I can see that the win32codecs are installed I can only play wmv with vlc, anyone can help? I have installed everything thing using automatix, which ppl here say is not good, but how can I fix it now?
[01:07] <philiKON> works nicely with a new user
[01:07] <philiKON> so, something about my configuration must be hosed
[01:07] <richee> ubuntu sucks :p
[01:07] <Jowi> philiKON, so something in ~/.gnome2 or something
[01:07] <huiber1>  philiKON: then maybe some app in your session is "stealing" the sound devicve, before gnome can access it?
[01:07] <philiKON> presumably
[01:07] <philiKON> i can just get rid of that
[01:07] <philiKON> there was nothign important there
[01:08] <huiber1>  philiKON: but I really hate it , how the gnome splash/login can hang because of something simple like this.
[01:08] <philiKON> we don't know what it is yet...
[01:08] <philiKON> but yeah, it seems a bit strange
[01:08] <Jowi> does anyone know if gnome will move its configs to ~/.config in the future?
[01:08] <snedar> is there a good reason why autohinter isn't enabled by default in ubuntu?
[01:09] <philiKON> hmm, problem is still there after deleting .gnome* and .nautilus
[01:10] <philiKON> now i just get a grey square in the upper left corner
[01:10] <philiKON> and when hovering the mouse over it, the cursor changes to a text cursor
[01:10] <philiKON> weird
[01:10] <huiber1>  philiKON: looks like you have removed _half_ of the gnome config :-(
[01:10] <Jowi> philiKON, how about .gtk* ?
[01:10] <philiKON> huiber1: ok, what's the other half? ;)
[01:11] <philiKON> Jowi: hmm, ok
[01:11] <philiKON> i'm new to gnome
[01:11] <huiber1>  philiKON: might work to delete it, throw it away
[01:11] <Jowi> philiKON, or .gconf* :)
[01:11] <philiKON> yeah, got rid of that too
[01:11] <Jowi> philiKON, or... or... or... hehe
[01:11] <philiKON> heck, i can throw away my user
[01:11] <philiKON> i just need to make that other one an admin, i suppose
[01:13] <MegaR0m> so anybody care to help me on my tuner problem ?
[01:13] <coz_> MegaR0m, well I have no idea what you mean ... tuner? problem
[01:14] <huiber1>  philiKON: yes, that should work...
[01:14] <david_> Hi, is this a good place to ask about a dapper->edgy upgrade problem?
[01:14] <philiKON> huiber1: i suppose it's about adding the user to the 'admin' group, right?
[01:14] <huiber1>  philiKON: but be carefull.
[01:14] <coz_> david this is theplace , what i s the question
[01:15] <david_> Ran into bug registered as Bug #67996 - opera is in a directory installer tries to delete
[01:15] <huiber1>  philiKON: I dont know precicely, the user might need other groups too, check your current user.
[01:15] <MegaR0m> well i got this
[01:15] <david_> Seems to screw up whole package updater system
[01:15] <MegaR0m> anyhow can u help on my tuner issue ?
[01:15] <MegaR0m>  02:09.0 Multimedia video controller: Conexant CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder (rev 05)   thats the card ... howto make a tuner from it ?
[01:15] <philiKON> huiber1: good idea
[01:15] <david_> Can I restore to some state that has workingness?
[01:15] <MegaR0m> i posted like 3 times earlier but noon replied coz_
[01:16] <huiber1> MegaR0m: maybe because nobody knows.
[01:16] <coz_> david_, well unfortunately i never use opera... sorry, however, someone here can certainly help with that problem
[01:16] <coz_> MegaR0m, sorrry to hear that
[01:16] <huiber1> MegaR0m: how about asking in a mythtv or dvr irc/forum?
[01:16] <david_> To be honest, I'd forgotten I installed it. (sorry I did - it was just for web-devel checking...
[01:17] <coz_> MegaR0m, ok i can tell you that i would not be the person with that knowledge... however two things...
[01:17] <huiber1> david_:yes, delete tne /usr/X11/bin/opera thingy.....
[01:17] <coz_> MegaR0m, first.. if someone says no one answers you probably because no on eknows... pay no attention to that
[01:17] <philiKON> huiber1: great, after giving the other user all those groups, same symptoms with that user account as well
[01:17] <coz_> MegaR0m, at least they can say they don't know
[01:18] <huiber1> philiKON:"now thats strange..."
[01:18] <philiKON> :)
[01:18] <coz_> MegaR0m, second... keep asking the question , not pesty like, but ask it several times.. people with the knowledge you need may not be online as of yet
[01:18] <david_> huiber1: Just the bit in X11R6/bin? Did that immediately - in fact don't know if it's that that screwed it up
[01:18] <coz_> MegaR0m, remember people are here form all over the planet so there are many time zones
[01:18] <iwkse> hi, how's possible to jump to a page with evince?
[01:19] <zeR> Wei jemand, ob es neben Gimmie noch andere alternative Panel-Anstze gibt?
[01:19] <huiber1> david_: yes, it abborts the x-org upgrade, and therefore aborts the system upgrade.
[01:19] <coz_> MegaR0m, i am sorry no one had the courtesy to tell you they didn't know the answer .. before
[01:19] <huiber1> david_: you  should be able to go into singleuser mode.
[01:20] <huiber1> david: and try apt-get dist-upgrade
[01:20] <jokoon> Is there a better DVI or PS viewer than the default one that allows to scroll the page by left clicking and moving the mouse up and down ?
[01:20] <david_> huiber1: I haven't restarted, so I'm still logged in. Should I reboot, and try again, then? How do I get to singleuser mode(sorry if silly question)?
[01:20] <iwkse> jokoon: evince with dvi support enabled
[01:20] <MegaR0m> tho somebody must know
[01:21] <jokoon> iwkse Yes that program was launched when I opened a PS file. What about scrolling with left click ?
[01:21] <coz_> MegaR0m, you know guy you are right... someone doesknow .. unfortuanatley i have no idea when those peple may bo online, but please continue to ask and don't get frustrated here come in at different times of the day you will get someone to answer you
[01:22] <blekos> hello
[01:22] <MegaR0m> o_0
[01:22] <coz_> MegaR0m, sorry
[01:22] <huiber1> david: If you are still logged in, try opeing a terminal or console
[01:22] <blekos> i got fingerprint recognition on my laptop, anyidea how i can make it work?
[01:22] <david_> huiber1: ok
[01:23] <coz_> MegaR0m, in the mean time while you are wiating to ask agin, you may want to google the question in different ways, i am sure  you ahve done some of this, but..
[01:24] <jerp> blekos, oooo that's what I want to get, may I ask what device you are using?
[01:24] <blekos> vaio vgn-sz3xp
[01:24] <MegaR0m> like i didnt
[01:24] <jerp> blek, so it must be built in, right?
[01:25] <blekos> yeap
[01:25] <philiKON> huiber1: i have the suspicion that your guess about sound system goes in the right direction
[01:25] <huiber1> david: I dont know if the system upgrade only performs a package upgrade, or if other things are changed as well...
[01:26] <blekos> unfortuenately it's not 100% linux compatible
[01:26] <blekos> i'm missing the built in camera functionality as well as
[01:26] <huiber1> philiKON: cool, ok. It was just a guess though
[01:26] <jerp> blekos, I built my own pc and need to get it as an add-on
[01:26] <blekos> the ability to change between the gr.cards
[01:26] <blekos> o i c
[01:26] <battlesquid> Seveas, i have added the gpg key as you outlined on the front page. i'm not sure which package i need, but i need syntax highlighting to work properly
[01:26] <philiKON> huiber1: i removed myself from the audio group
[01:26] <gavintu> if i want to find a file... lets say "buntu*", through console how would I do that?
[01:26] <philiKON> huiber1: and killed all my hanging processes
[01:27] <[Kork] > hi. somebody know a way to add a repository exclusively for one package?
[01:27] <philiKON> huiber1: among them was esd
[01:27] <philiKON> huiber1: now i can log in again
[01:27] <philiKON> huiber1: thanks
[01:27] <david_> huiber1: I'm not event sure how far it got in pre-install terms - the window for system upgrade is not very informative...
[01:27] <huiber1> philiKON: "huiber1: now i can log in again" YEAH
[01:28] <huiber1> david_: if the opera bug bit you, your halfway down package-upgrade-lane
[01:28] <savvas> hi, why does is this shown in gnome baker's output (normal user): Error: Cannot gain SYS_RAWIO capability.Is cdrecord installed SUID root?
[01:28] <savvas> : Operation not permitted
[01:28] <jerp> a gigabyte mb with a  amd64 athlon 3000+ venice (clocked at 1.8 gH)
[01:28] <david_> huiber1: I hoped you'd tell me all was well and nothing had been done yet :o/ Any thoughts what can be done?
[01:29] <huiber1> david: once you start, there is only one way to go: FORWARD
[01:29] <philiKON> btw, ubuntu 6.10 is very very nice
[01:29] <david_> huiber1: That's fine - it's DOWN that worries me
[01:29] <frogzoo> philiKON: much over dapper ?
[01:29] <philiKON> dunno
[01:30] <jerp> sorry, mb=MB  (as in motherboard)
[01:30] <philiKON> it's the first ubuntu i've tried
[01:30] <philiKON> after having been a long time debian user up until 3 years ago
[01:30] <philiKON> when i switched to the mac
[01:30] <frogzoo> philiKON: ah, k
[01:30] <savvas> philiKON: it's the human theme that does the trick :p
[01:30] <philiKON> heh
[01:31] <battlesquid> Seveas, after adding the lines to sources.list and running apt-get update i get  "GPG error: http://seveas.imbrandon.com dapper-seveas Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: ..."

[01:32] <bXi> is it possible to move a windows partition from a 30gb disk to a partition on a 200gb ?
[01:32] <savvas> !seveas
[01:32] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[01:32] <huiber1> david_: I helped somebody before, who upgraded from 5.10 to 6.06 and in the middle off it all there was a power outage.
[01:32] <livingtarget> battlesquid: try wget http://seveas.imbrandon.com/1135D466.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[01:32] <huiber1> david_: system could only start in single user mode
[01:32] <battlesquid> livingtarget, i have done that
[01:32] <ath0_up> what do i need to change in the vsftpd configuration file to have it sharing a folder without password?
[01:32] <livingtarget> it should have added the key
[01:32] <ath0_up> not my home
[01:32] <frogzoo> bXi: partition, no, all the files, yes
[01:33] <huiber1> david_: after starting dist-upgrade from console a few times (salted wit a few FORCE parameters) everything was OK in an hour
[01:33] <blekos> how can i make vlc the default player for firefox?
[01:33] <battlesquid> livingdaylight, it took a while, but output nothing so i assume it went OK
[01:34] <livingdaylight> battlesquid, huh?
[01:34] <livingtarget> he meant me
[01:34] <livingdaylight> ok
[01:34] <savvas> battlesquid: it should say 'OK'
[01:34] <bimberi> too much living :)
[01:34] <Shock> hey I need help installing ubuntu 6.1
[01:34] <livingdaylight> hey, Lots of LIVING going on here
[01:35] <david_> huiber1: Sounds encouraging. Where do we start?
[01:35] <bimberi> hi battlesquid.  After all that there's a ready made backport available :)
[01:35] <livingdaylight> shock, 6.1 doesn't exist
[01:35] <bimberi> livingdaylight: :)
[01:35] <philiKON> how do i tell gnome-terminal to remember more lines of output?
[01:35] <livingdaylight> bimberi, hehe
[01:35] <huiber1> david_: is the normal ubuntu updater stopped
[01:35] <Shock> http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download
[01:35] <jokoon> Is it legal to us windows xp emulated with VMWare under linux ?
[01:35] <livingdaylight> and lots of DYING!
[01:35] <david_> huiber1: Yeah
[01:35] <iwkse> philiKON: look inside optiosn
[01:35] <Shock> it does exist..
[01:36] <livingdaylight> Shock, what exactly is the problem?
[01:36] <battlesquid> living*: get a new nick ^^
[01:36] <huiber1> david_: ok, what programms are still running?
[01:36] <iwkse> jokoon: if you have a licence of xp, why not?
[01:36] <Toma-> jokoon: if you own the windows xp disk yes
[01:36] <philiKON> iwkse: that's what i mean... where *are* the options? ;)
[01:36] <finalbeta> jokoon, for XP yes, for Vista no. You still need a Valid key for XP though.
[01:36] <Shock> I am getting an error like : [numbers]  buffer i/o error at... [numbers] 
[01:36] <livingdaylight> Shock, yes, you meant ubuntu 6.10
[01:36] <frogzoo> jokoon: it's legal as long as you have a xp licence for that machine, I believe (no legal expert)
[01:36] <david_> huiber1: I seem to have full functionality - am running terminal and XChat at the mo
[01:36] <jokoon> iwkse So I need a disk of windows XP, there is no existing VMX downloadable files ?
[01:37] <Shock> when I run the start and install ubuntu option from the live cd boot up
[01:37] <livingdaylight> Shock, talk to me bro, otherwise ...
[01:37] <savvas> livingdaylight: simple mathematics rule make 6.1 to be the same as 6.10
[01:37] <finalbeta> jokoon, no there are none, that would be illigal.
[01:37] <huiber1> david_: good. start a terminal and do a "sudo root"
[01:37] <livingdaylight> savvas, nope. 10 refers to October
[01:37] <Shock> livingdaylight, pm please?
[01:37] <jokoon> and what if I ask here if there are these files on bittorrent ?
[01:37] <iwkse> jokoon: no, there ins't
[01:37] <david_> huiber1: sudo: root: command not found
[01:38] <livingdaylight> Shock, just say what your problem is and i or someone might be able to help you
[01:38] <savvas> Shock: what were you doing exactly when you got that error? did you download the cd image and checked it with md5sum if it's ok?
[01:38] <huiber1> david_: sorry, to fast typing on my side, try "sudo su"
[01:38] <bimberi> philiKON: Edit, Current Profile, Scrolling
[01:38] <philiKON> bimberi: ah, thanks
[01:38] <Shock> yes I did check the md5 checksum
[01:38] <david_> huiber1: Better :o)
[01:38] <Shock> it matches
[01:38] <jokoon> But I need the pro version to emulate a windows xp ? not only the player version ?
[01:38] <livingdaylight> Shock, did you check for defects on loading the cd as well?

[01:39] <livingtarget> battlesquid: check your pm
[01:39] <admin123> We have amd systemes which have SIS chipets and intel systems which have Via chipsets. I was wondering how well X autoconfiguration is implented. for example: dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive -pcritical xserver-xorg dosn't modify my configuration, when I put a via cipset driver on a nv driver it still remains standing on the nv driver instead of chaning it.
[01:39] <Shock> livingdaylight, I get the same errors when I do that

[01:42] <pecisk> crowd, is is true that EVMS patch is already included in Edgy, t.i. 2.6.17 kernel?
[01:42] <savvas> Shock: so it's not during the installation? it's when you clicked on that menu item?
[01:42] <iwkse> jokoon: if you have a vmplayer and a winxp install cd you will not solve it
[01:42] <Shock> savvas, yeah
[01:42] <battlesquid> cypher1, yes, why do you ask?
[01:42] <frogzoo> jokoon: yes, well, that, a vmx image (which is just a simple text file) and an xp licence

[01:47] <livingtarget> how do I store my MAC address so it will set it on boot up? Currently I have to run sudo ifconfig eth1 hw ether MY_MAC_HERE to set my MAC each time I boot up, I imagine there must be a file somewhere I can save this.
[01:47] <savvas> fun :)
[01:47] <cypher1> savvas, the directories accessible depends on the directory into which the users login.. in case of chrooted users and little different for others

[01:50] <Reolosi> I'm trying to install Ubuntu, after a few minutes of running my monitor said "Frequency out of range!" and switched to standby, and now it says "DPMS no signal"
[01:50] <bimberi> livingtarget: np :)
[01:50] <finalbeta> napg, no idea, but when it does that, use "alsamixer" , go to the master channel and press M. it should be unmuted. (you can do that for every channel that's muted)
[01:50] <athum> cypher1: do u know?
[01:50] <frogzoo> iwkse: http://www.easyvmx.com/
[01:51] <iwkse> frogzoo: thanks
[01:51] <Reolosi> Is there anything I can do?
[01:51] <cypher1> athum, i did not understand your question
[01:51] <battlesquid> ok, i have the gpg key and added the Seveas lines to /etc/apt/sources.list but if i do sudo apt-get install vim now (have already purge removed vim) will i get vim from Seveas repo or the regular?
[01:51] <athum> how to install TUNER TV: KWORLD LTV 883, chipset : Conexant883
[01:51] <bimberi> battlesquid: should get the latest version (ie. from Seveas' repo)
[01:52] <livingtarget> if you did apt-get update first and then try it, it "should" work
[01:52] <napg> finalbeta, even on the alsamixer the sound doesnt show as muted and all the sliders are maxed out but i get no sound
[01:52] <Reolosi> Does it try to switch to 1280x1024 or something? my monitor's max is 1024x768
[01:52] <cypher1> athum, sorry i do not know.. someone here who knows it will respond to you

[01:58] <finalbeta> dasMetty, http://www.snipes.org/index.php?page=How_To_Setup_A_Transparent_Network_Bridge That page might help but will need some modding I guess.
[01:58] <jrib> vinicri: "put in line" where?
[01:58] <david_> huiber1: OK. Still says same thing. Culminating in "E: Unmet dependencies. Try apt-get -f install with no packages (or specify a solution)."
[01:58] <JJAUA> sorry ubotu... i'm kind of new with this stuff... and Thanks jrib...
[01:58] <battlesquid> JJAUA, ubotu is a bot :)

[02:01] <jrib> vinicri: wget
[02:01] <H3g3m0n> felixfoertsch_: Yeh ran ok for me, a few minor bugs (crashed when resizing panels) but im guessing theres a good chance there fixed in newer versions
[02:01] <First|Laptop> felixfoertsch_: I'm pretty sure crossover will let you run it.
[02:01] <storkme> how can i make it so that when i press ctrl+alt+backspace it restarts and logs back into my desktop user instead of bringing up the login screen
[02:01] <vinicri> jrib, how i can i do it?
[02:01] <DARKGuy> Good morning :) can anybody reccommend (spelling?) me a good python IDE/editor with syntax highlighting and possibly run the script in the same program? easy to use too, Vi's worse than a spaceship terminal
[02:01] <felixfoertsch_> First|Laptop: What is crossover?
[02:02] <H3g3m0n> storkme: You can enable automagical gdm login it will mean it autologins on computer boot too though
[02:02] <First|Laptop> Hold on, I'm looking up some more info. I saw it mentioned on a forum but never had a reason to delve into it.
[02:02] <storkme> H3g3m0n, yeah, that's what i want.. how can i do that?
[02:03] <First|Laptop> felixfoertsch_: http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/

[02:03] <DarkED> Hi all, I'm having a problem with the 6.10 livecd, it boots and Gnome loads up, but after everything loads up it just keeps reading something from the CD, this went on for an hour before I just rebooted
[02:03] <H3g3m0n> storkme: System>Admin>Login>security
[02:03] <livingtarget> storkme: System -> Administration -> Login Window, go to security tab and check 'Enable automatic login', write your username and tada!
[02:04] <livingtarget> ya what he said
[02:04] <tigerman> Anyone know of a program that can restore a damaged superblock?
[02:04] <DarkED> During this time, the OS just locks, clock doesnt change, mouse doesn't move, nadda
[02:04] <falta> http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu//6.06/ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso <--- works as livecd?
[02:04] <storkme> H3g3m0n, yeah, i've done that, but it doesn't work if i press ctrl+alt+backspace.. it brings me back to the login screen
[02:04] <vinicri> jrib, the links don't access the files directly. I need a script that just find the link on the page and download it
[02:04] <First|Laptop> felixfoertsch_: photoshop is supported
[02:04] <Reolosi> btw, can i install ubuntu to the hdd from the livecd like with other livecds?
[02:04] <DarkED> I know the iso and disc are valid, I checksummed both of them
[02:04] <felixfoertsch_> First|Laptop: Yep. Looked it up. Thanks!
[02:05] <H3g3m0n> storkme: You might need timed logins too, i think auto is just for initial boot timed works for xcrashes (you can just press enter if the time is taking too long)
[02:05] <eloquence_> is this correct:
[02:05] <eloquence_> adil@provision:~/ieee80211-1.1.14$ sudo apt-get install linux-source-2.6.15-27-386
[02:05] <First|Laptop> np
[02:05] <eloquence_> ?
[02:05] <jrib> vinicri: I see, I don't know of any specifically made to do that with rapidshare then
[02:05] <DarkED> basically I want to install 6.10 but I can't because it locks up before I have the chance, so what can I do?
[02:05] <falta> im a bit new here
[02:05] <eloquence_> or am i supposed to leave off the -27-386 ?
[02:05] <falta> can I burn http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu//6.06/ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso as livecd to boot?
[02:05] <bimberi> battlesquid: cool :)
[02:05] <eloquence_> any ideas?

[02:06] <falta> mkay
[02:06] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, you most likely don't need to install the full kernel source, but just the headers
[02:06] <felixfoertsch_> Thx @ all!
[02:06] <HymnToLife> do      sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[02:06] <battlesquid> and thanks to everyone who helped me, from me and the users on my server!
[02:06] <finalbeta> nautilus = ftp client, lol.
[02:07] <HymnToLife> Windows Explorer inj an FTP client, too :p
[02:07] <eloquence_> i did the headers
[02:07] <HymnToLife> is*
[02:07] <tigerman> yep..
[02:07] <eloquence_> and i am having the sam eproblem that i was having
[02:07] <eloquence_> its rediculous
[02:07] <tigerman> its not a GOOD one, but it is one
[02:07] <HymnToLife> which is ?
[02:07] <livingtarget> While I'm here I might as well ask about this. Often I need to change my grub and each time I install a new kernel I will have to do those changes again. For example I need grub to boot of /dev/hdc1 instead of /dev/hda1
[02:07] <DarkED> Anyone have any ideas?
[02:07] <eloquence_> trying to install ieee80211 subsystem to install interl ipw3945 wireless lan drivers
[02:08] <Reolosi> Can I install Ubuntu from the Live CD?
[02:08] <jrib> DarkED: have you tried the alternate cd?
[02:08] <boink> livingtarget: have you used "update-grub" ?
[02:08] <DarkED> jrib: Alternate?
[02:08] <HymnToLife> livingtarget, edit the automagic options at the beginning of your menu.lst
[02:08] <finalbeta> Reolosi, yes, you are supposed 2
[02:08] <HymnToLife> before the actual kernels list
[02:08] <DarkED> jrib: I was aware that the only installer was on the liveCD for this version...
[02:08] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, were installed OOTB for me...
[02:08] <Reolosi> well my disc is Ubuntu 4.10
[02:09] <Nazcafan> hi
[02:09] <bimberi> Reolosi: not that LiveCD, no
[02:09] <eloquence_> http://pastebin.ca/264382
[02:09] <jrib> DarkED: what version?
[02:09] <DarkED> jrib: 6.10 Edgy
[02:09] <finalbeta> Reolosi, then you should have put that info in the initial question :/
[02:09] <jrib> DarkED: http://mirrors.csumb.edu/ubuntu/edgy/
[02:09] <DarkED> jrib: i know there is a DVD version but I don't have a DVD burner
[02:09] <livingtarget> HymnToLife: So where it says # kopt_2_6=root=/dev/hda1 ro I change that to match /dev/hdc1?
[02:09] <Reolosi> Ah, sorry
[02:09] <boink> DarkED: you have the alternate iso images as well
[02:09] <noiesmo> yeah go for it
[02:09] <boink> I had to one use one
[02:09] <Nazcafan> I recompiled my kernel on an old laptop (with dapper), everything is fine but I get a black screen at boot until gdm starts ... any clue ?
[02:09] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, you shouldn't have done that I think
[02:10] <Reolosi> Will 6.06.1 be okay, or should I go for the absolute latest?
[02:10] <eloquence_> has anybody had the same problem with ieee80211?
[02:10] <DarkED> so the alt has the text-based installer
[02:10] <boink> Reolosi: depends on your pain factor
[02:10] <eloquence_> what do u mean?
[02:10] <HymnToLife> my ipw3945 worked OOTB in Dapper and Edgy
[02:10] <First|Laptop> Reolosi: Dapper is quite stable
[02:10] <boink> darkED: yes
[02:10] <eloquence_> hymn mine worked too
[02:10] <HymnToLife> I think you messed something up by trying to install them
[02:10] <Reolosi> Dapper = 6.0.6.1?
[02:10] <First|Laptop> yes
[02:10] <eloquence_> but was an unrecognized device
[02:10] <boink> Dapper is a LTS
[02:10] <finalbeta> Reolosi, 6.06.1 is the most stable version, will be supported longer then the newest. The newest does have newer gnome etc, but is buggy.
[02:10] <boink> !LTS
[02:10] <ubotu> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[02:11] <eloquence_> i tried to install some drivers yesterday ... sum1 told me i needed broadcom drivers not intel
[02:11] <eloquence_> when i did that
[02:11] <boink> edgy is ... well, on the edge
[02:11] <eloquence_> it wiped my wireless device off
[02:11] <HymnToLife> hmm
[02:11] <First|Laptop> sort of
[02:11] <jrib> Reolosi: main advantage of 6.06: security releases for longer (with 6.10 you'll need to upgrade sooner)    main advantage of 6.10: more recent software
[02:11] <dcordes> where can i find a good guide on creating an ftpserver?
[02:11] <eloquence_> now i am screwed kind of
[02:11] <HymnToLife> are you _sure_ your card is an ipw3945 ?
[02:11] <eloquence_> and need to install the real drivers no matter what
[02:11] <boink> dcordes: yes
[02:11] <boink> !pure_ftpd
[02:11] <eloquence_> i have an HP dv8000t laptop

[02:11] <First|Laptop> hmm
[02:11] <eloquence_> and it says it uses that type
[02:11] <First|Laptop> !pureftpd
[02:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pureftpd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:11] <First|Laptop> Guess not
[02:11] <boink> hmm .. pure_ftpd is a good ftp server. easy to set up and very secure
[02:12] <HymnToLife> [14:09]  <livingtarget> HymnToLife: So where it says # kopt_2_6=root=/dev/hda1 ro I change that to match /dev/hdc1?     <= exactrly
[02:12] <dcordes> i allready have ftp installed but i don't know how to configure
[02:12] <boink> do a good search: pure_ftpd and ubuntu
[02:12] <jrib> Reolosi: try the live cd for each version and see what you prefer.  I don't find edgy buggy, but I may just not use the features that have bugs I guess
[02:12] <dcordes> so you suggest pure_ftp?
[02:12] <boink> dapper is quite solid, though
[02:12] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, what does lspci tell you regarding your wireles nic ?
[02:12] <bimberi> Nazcafan: I have a similiar issue (since installing Edgy) fixed by adding "vga=773" to the relevent kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:12] <boink> I like pure-ftpd, yeah.
[02:12] <finalbeta> dcordes, then you should have mentioned that in the first question again. What FTPd.
[02:12] <TheMafia> I installed skype and have it working on dapper, does skype offer video chat?
[02:12] <eloquence_> not much
[02:12] <DarkED> okay, well like i said, the performace of the livecd was horrible, if i install the actual OS is that what I'm looking at?
[02:13] <boink> DarkED: who knows
[02:13] <boink> try it and find out
[02:13] <dcordes> finalbeta: sorry. pure_Ftp
[02:13] <TheMafia> DarkED, probably not
[02:13] <jrib> DarkED: the livecd is usually a lot slower since it is running from the cd
[02:13] <Nazcafan> bimberi: I run a dapper, I'll try to add what you said, thanks
[02:13] <livingtarget> HymnToLife: thx, that did the trick it's all changed automatically now. :)
[02:13] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, please pastebin your lspci ;)
[02:13] <eloquence_> i will
[02:13] <eloquence_> one sec
[02:13] <DarkED> yeah, sorry for so many questions, I've just never tried running linux on a system this slow before...
[02:13] <eloquence_> i pastebinned it earlier just finding the url
[02:13] <HymnToLife> livingtarget, yeah, that's what it's for ;)
[02:13] <jrib> DarkED: how slow?
[02:14] <boink> I have edgy running on an old Sony laptop .. made for Win 98
[02:14] <eloquence_> http://pastebin.ca/264355
[02:14] <boink> works just fine
[02:14] <dcordes> !ftp
[02:14] <ubotu> FTP clients: gftp, konqueror, kbear, nautilus. FTP servers: ftpd, proftpd, pure-ftpd, twoftpd, vsftpd
[02:14] <livingtarget> lol it's just confusing as it's commented out
[02:14] <[^Twen^] > I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my computer, but when I'm clicking "install ubuntu" the installation won't really start. I'm getting this message:
[02:14] <[^Twen^] > *Timeout waiting for DMA
[02:14] <[^Twen^] >  what does it means?
[02:14] <eloquence_> this is lspci and dmesg both
[02:14] <boink> Twen: it means you should use the alternate CD
[02:14] <DarkED> jrib: Compaq Armada laptop, Celery 700mhz, 192meg ram, 100mhz bus
[02:14] <[^Twen^] > boink: oh? and whats that? =)
[02:15] <boink> check the iso download page, you'll fine the alternate iso image there
[02:15] <jrib> DarkED: you might want to try Xubuntu, it's meant for slower systems
[02:15] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, and    lspci -n ?
[02:15] <boink> I'm using xubuntu on that old sony laptop, works alright
[02:15] <boink> had some problems with the wireless, though.
[02:15] <DarkED> boink: sys specs?
=== hantoo is now known as hantu
[02:15] <Nazcafan> bimberi: the thing is that this option is not there for the standard ubuntu kernel and they work fine :(
[02:15] <boink> well, think of a sony vaio in 1999 :)
[02:16] <DarkED> boink: yep, same here :D Compaq Armada in 1999
[02:16] <bobbyd> hi
[02:16] <eloquence_> HymnToLife, http://pastebin.ca/264462
[02:16] <boink> so, firstly use xubuntu and then use the alternate CD
[02:16] <eloquence_> the same old stuff with new lspci -n
[02:16] <[^Twen^] > boink: so it means I cannot use Ubuntu? Do I have to use xubuntu or something?
[02:16] <boink> gnome and kde are too much bloat
[02:16] <boink> you could try ubuntu
[02:16] <DarkED> besides having the celeron, this was actually a high-end laptop when it was made... so sad
[02:17] <[^Twen^] > boink: but It wont work?
[02:17] <bobbyd> the version of vide lan client in edgy doesn't seem to have transcoding codecs compiled in, when I try to set up a stream to transcode a file it just fails. Does anyone have this working?
[02:17] <boink> xfce works quite well, though
[02:17] <boink> Twen: I don't know, I don't have a crystal ball.
[02:17] <boink> just try it
[02:17] <jrib> [^Twen^] : no, alternate cd is just a different way to install.  It is text-based instead of loading you into the gui for the install.  And Xubuntu is still ubunut, it just uses xfce by default
[02:17] <DarkED> boink: yeah but can't I just setup normal Ubuntu then apt-get xubuntu-desktop?
[02:17] <boink> sure
[02:18] <[^Twen^] > jrib: thank you :)
[02:18] <DarkED> okay, just checking :D been a while...
[02:18] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, yep, it's indeed an ipw3945
[02:18] <[^Twen^] > jrib: cause it really seemed like the installation wouldn't start..
[02:18] <boink> bobbyd: you need to adjust your /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:18] <eloquence_> check this out to: http://pastebin.ca/264380
[02:18] <boink> then download the right codecs.
[02:18] <boink> !codecs

[02:18] <[^Twen^] > jrib: you know where I can find an Alternade version/CD ?
[02:18] <HymnToLife> but what annoys me is that mine worked ootb
[02:19] <eloquence_> mine did too
[02:19] <DarkED> i really hope this alternate cd works... its a lot of trouble to download ANOTHER CD...
=== wind__ is now known as windtw
[02:19] <HymnToLife> I think you messed something trying to install the ieee802.22 subsystem
[02:19] <bobbyd> boink: to encode with VLC?
[02:19] <eloquence_> but i unfed it up last night thinkin it was broadcom thanks to sum1
[02:19] <eloquence_> no
[02:19] <jrib> [^Twen^] : it's on the download page, as "other isntallation options".  You'll end up at a page like this one http://mirrors.csumb.edu/ubuntu/edgy/ and it is on there, just grep for "alternate"
[02:19] <DarkED> oh noes... uh... can the alt-cd installer resize a NTFS?
[02:19] <HymnToLife> eloquence_, then why on earth did you mess up with that ?
[02:19] <boink> to rip dvds?
[02:19] <eloquence_> since this morning my computer wasn't recognizing the wlan
[02:19] <huiber1> david_: then try "apt-get install -f" just as proposed by apt-get it self (the programm is very helpfull)
[02:20] <Nazcafan> bimberi: it didn't work for me :( worse, now the consoles don't work anymore
[02:20] <Ring_Donut> Is there a Linux From Scratch Channel?
[02:20] <eloquence_> ieee80211 had nothing to do with the thing not working
[02:20] <eloquence_> i am trying to fix what happened
[02:20] <bobbyd> boink: the videlan guys just told me all codecs were compiled in to VLC...
[02:20] <flavioribeiro> Hi, i have a USB sound, but i only can hear if i restart the X. When i press control alt backspace my sound starts.. anyone know any command that restart the usb ports?
[02:20] <bimberi> Nazcafan: quick, take it back out again
[02:20] <eloquence_> HymnToLife, i was just advised that it is better to have your device driver loaded than for linux to just make things work
[02:20] <eloquence_> if u know what i mena
[02:20] <eloquence_> like windows i guess
[02:20] <Nazcafan> bimberi: I'm working on it
[02:20] <[^Twen^] > Now I started the alternate download. Thank you.
[02:21] <Nazcafan> bimberi: I think I'll just desactivate splash boot
[02:21] <HymnToLife> well, no, it's not working the same ;)
[02:21] <Nazcafan> err
[02:21] <HymnToLife> if your hardware is working, then the driver is installed
[02:21] <Nazcafan> disable, I mean
[02:21] <david_> huiber1: Same prob - trying to overwrite that X11 bin directory "which is also in package opera"
[02:21] <ubitux> hi
[02:21] <Ring_Donut> Hi
[02:21] <[^Twen^] > *netsplit* hehe =)
=== daxxar_ is now known as daxxar
[02:21] <Ring_Donut> lol
[02:21] <Ring_Donut> that looked meaty
[02:21] <Ring_Donut> lol
[02:22] <huiber1> david_: dam** try to remove opera before proceding
[02:22] <bimberi> pfft, just a tiddler
[02:22] <Nazcafan> net split ?
[02:22] <jrib> Ring_Donut: www.linuxfromscratch.org/support.html  lists their official ones
[02:22] <Ring_Donut> jrib: Thankyou
[02:22] <HymnToLife> Nazcafan, a netsplit is what just happened
[02:22] <huiber1> david_: try "dpkg -r opera"
[02:22] <bimberi> !netsplit
[02:22] <ubotu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[02:22] <flavioribeiro> how can i restart the usb ports?
[02:22] <[^Twen^] > do I have to format my HD before installing Ubuntu ?
[02:22] <Nazcafan> HymnToLife: ok, thanks
[02:23] <HymnToLife> but sometimes it can disconnect hundreds of people at once
[02:23] <HymnToLife> and that's cool :p
[02:23] <Rprp> Hi, whats the name of the 'menu' editor?
[02:23] <dcordes> alacarte
[02:23] <david_> huiber1: aha... That seems to have worked. Running install -f now and it's getting much further (still going)
[02:24] <Nazcafan> bimberi: well I disabled the splash screen, now at least it works, the strange thing is that I just changed disabled SMP and PREEMPT before recompiling so it should work exactly as a standard ubuntu kernel ..., maybe I missed stg
[02:24] <huiber1> david_: this may take a while
[02:24] <livingtarget> Alacarta, but it's hidden as Menu Layout in the menus
[02:24] <Ring_Donut> [^Twen^] , nope, unless you want to wipe your previous OS off the HD
[02:25] <huiber1> david_: you may need to issue the command "apt-get install -f" and "apt-get dist-upgrade" a few times untill _all_ packeges are completely upgraded
[02:25] <[^Twen^] > Ring_Donut: hehe, its allready wiped =)
[02:25] <Ring_Donut> [^Twen^] , you can partition the HD and install Ubuntu on the new partition
[02:25] <eloquence_> HymnToLife, any idea what i should do?
[02:25] <eloquence_> right now i am using dialup through ethernet
[02:26] <david_> huiber1: Oh. Yes it has broken - Errors while processing: volumeid. So which command do I try next?

[02:27] <boink> Twen: yes

[02:30] <boink> how are you restarting the demon?
[02:30] <Ring_Donut> dcordes, don't use deamons
[02:30] <r7^black> tried to install this, from cd x64, and i boot up from cd and select instal ubuntu, it goes thru, loading linux kernel
[02:30] <r7^black> and gets up to the point where it plays asound
[02:30] <r7^black> but then just has a statis _ in top left of screen
[02:30] <r7^black> yany ideas?
[02:30] <Ring_Donut> r7^black: download the alternate install CD from Ubuntu website

[02:32] <boink> have you tried the alternate cd?
[02:32] <Red_Death> Is there a more robust mouse-cursor manager then the one that comes with ubuntu?
[02:32] <davor> jrib: thanks
[02:33] <huiber1> david_: sorry, I have no ideas (yer) how to fix you volumeid problem
[02:33] <r7^black> when you say, download the alternate cd version, do you mean just download it from the site andburn it todisk? just the main download ye?
[02:33] <boink> yes
[02:33] <huiber1> david_: and I will be away for the next 2 Hours.
[02:33] <Ring_Donut> r7^black: maybe your PC just can't handle the almighty power
[02:33] <boink> the alternate cd is just an install cd
[02:33] <Ring_Donut> yeah
[02:33] <Red_Death> Is there a more robust mouse-cursor manager then the one that comes with ubuntu?
[02:33] <r7^black> well wont that be exactly the same as the copies i got sent?
[02:33] <boink> no live-cd stuff
[02:33] <huiber1> david_: I hoped that deleting opera would do the trick....
[02:33] <Andypat10> !ubotu
[02:34] <boink> no, they send out the live-cd
[02:34] <r7^black> ok
[02:34] <Ring_Donut> I didn't use any Live-CD
[02:34] <praveer_fedora> boink: my friend wants to change partition table, he is on ubuntu 6.06, please tell me if there is a partition manager frontend on ubuntu live, or should i guide him to come here
[02:34] <Ring_Donut> So yuo shouldn't either, lol
[02:34] <david_> huiber1: Am ok waiting - things aren't particularly urgent, but how badly broken do you think things are at this point?

[02:54] <frogzoo> boink: just I'd suggest that will tell what's missing

[02:59] <xipietotec> is there anything similar to cleartype for Ubuntu?
[03:00] <frogzoo> xipietotec: that depends what cleartype does
[03:00] <xipietotec> frogzoo: cleartype is the new font rendering engine in the latest XP and in Vista
[03:00] <xipietotec> really really smooth good looking fonts

[03:02] <HymnToLife> !hi | A3n
[03:02] <sirk> ops
[03:02] <ubotu> A3n: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:03] <A3n> how do i install build-essential without using internet?
[03:03] <HymnToLife> it is on your CD if you used an alternate
[03:03] <boink> you could maybe install it off the CD
[03:03] <dv5237> jrib: thanks *shame*
[03:03] <A3n> i got the cd shipped, dont know
[03:03] <boink> use the cd as your repo in /etc/apt/sources.list
[03:04] <dcordes> i can't edit the list of restricted modules: "sudo nano /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common: No such file or directory" what can be the reason?
[03:04] <boink> because the file doesn't exist
[03:04] <dcordes> boink: yes oviously. but what packet is missing?
[03:05] <HymnToLife> linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[03:05] <dwad> could someone help me?
[03:05] <boink> !ask
[03:05] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:05] <HymnToLife> !helpme
[03:05] <dcordes> HymnToLife: thx
[03:05] <Ring_Donut> dwad: ask away
[03:06] <dwad> Is it ok to burn ubuntu with nero 7 instead of imgburn?
[03:06] <A3n> i can download files on windows and than mount my ntfs driver and access the linux files, but i dont know what i need to download to be able to use "make" like "make install" for example
[03:06] <gummibaerchen> of course, dwad
[03:06] <Hoag> Hey. Does anyone know how to set a text box alert thing on gAIM when someone signs in? Similar to msn messenger?
[03:07] <HymnToLife> A3n, build-essential
[03:07] <Jowi> !make | A3n
[03:07] <ubotu> A3n: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[03:07] <HymnToLife> Hoag, there's a plugin for it IIRC
[03:07] <gummibaerchen> add event, Hoag
[03:07] <dwad> eithery way, they both error out a lot. ive wasted about 15 disks trying to get them to burn successfully, even at low speeds. the 1 i got to work i get to the install part and it says I/o Error on Device sr0 logical block 357564
[03:07] <HymnToLife> just look around in the plugins dialog
[03:07] <elkbuntu> Hoag, try sudo apt-get install gaim-guifications
[03:07] <A3n> yes well i downloaded build-essential but apperantly i cant or dont know how to install it
[03:07] <frogzoo> dwad: anything that can write a bootable cd image will work - so nero7, yes
[03:07] <Hoag> Awesome, thanks all :)
[03:07] <gummibaerchen> dwad: uhh, that's bad, is the file ok (md5sum)?
[03:08] <Jowi> A3n, "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
[03:08] <dcordes> HymnToLife: ok the packet was missing. but i still dont have that file. reboot neccessary?
[03:08] <dwad> md5sum ?
[03:08] <A3n> i dont have internet
[03:08] <boink> you need to make sure your /etc/apt/sources.list is in order
[03:08] <HymnToLife> most likely no
[03:08] <HymnToLife> why do you want to edit that file anyway ?
[03:08] <Jowi> A3n, it's a .deb package?
[03:08] <A3n> i need "make install" to install ndiswrapper so i can get my drives to work
[03:08] <dwad> boink is that to me?
[03:08] <frogzoo> dwad: maybe you're burning faster than the media is spec'd?
[03:08] <Jowi> A3n, "sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb"
[03:09] <A3n> ow.. where do i get the build-essential .deb ?
[03:09] <boink> no, if your /etc/apt/sources.list is pointing to the cd,
[03:09] <boink>  use agpt-get
[03:09] <jrib> A3n: that probably won't work as build-essential just pulls in other packages.  Use the cd as someone suggested, it is on there.  Do you know how to add the cd to your repos?
[03:09] <dwad> ive put it 8x
[03:09] <boink> A3n: are you even listening?
[03:09] <frogzoo> A3n: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[03:09] <A3n> yes
[03:09] <boink> firstly, do an apt-cache search build-essentials
[03:09] <defrysk> -s
[03:10] <A3n> i dont know how to get the files from the cd or w/e
[03:10] <toomawaayyy> hi
[03:10] <A3n> i'm pretty new to linux
[03:10] <toomawaayyy> anyone can help me?
[03:10] <defrysk> !anyone
[03:10] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:10] <jrib> A3n: have you tried inserting the cd while using the desktop?  It usually prompts you to add itself to the repository list
[03:10] <boink> A3N: for the 3rd time, and listen this time, check your /etc/apt/sources.list
[03:11] <boink> I'm not explaining this again
[03:11] <A3n> ok boink, what do i need to check it for?
[03:11] <A3n> what do i search in it?
[03:11] <boink> this is silly. /ignore
[03:11] <A3n> jrib:i'll try that
[03:11] <fyrestrtr> A3n: you need some help?
[03:11] <jrib> A3n: if it doesn't work just go to system > administration > synaptic.  Then edit > add cdrom repository
[03:12] <defrysk> A3n, if you are new to linux you have no business using build-essential
[03:12] <Hoag> elkbuntu: guifications is awesome, thanks a bundle.
[03:12] <A3n> i do i need to get internet to work
[03:12] <elkbuntu> Hoag, :)
[03:12] <A3n> therefor i need ndiswrapper
[03:12] <defrysk> A3n, I see
[03:12] <A3n> and for ndiswrapper i need "make install"
[03:12] <defrysk> !ndiswrapper
[03:12] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:12] <effie_jayx> A3n,  I can't remeber using a make install
[03:12] <A3n> i got ndiswrapper i just need to install it
[03:12] <effie_jayx> A3n,  and I did install a broadcom card
[03:13] <A3n> how did you install ndiswrapper then?
[03:13] <fyrestrtr> A3n: the first thing you need to do, is read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:13] <A3n> it says so in the ndiswrapper -instalation wiki
[03:13] <toomawaayyy> i have amd athlon X2 3800+ socket AM2 and motherboard asus with chipset nforce4. I have download iso for AMD64 architecture. I boot from cd and select install but after have load kernel, there's a black image with ubuntu and the system don't process with the installation (i've have waited half hour)
[03:13] <defrysk> A3n, why did you not ask about ndiswrapper right away ? (the real question)
[03:13] <toomawaayyy> u know why?
[03:13] <A3n> because i know i need to "make install" it and that is not the problem
[03:14] <A3n> i need to be able to use "make" first
[03:14] <hastesaver> A3n, ndiswrapper may not be necessary... maybe your card can work even without that?
[03:14] <A3n> because i also need "wireless tools for linux" wich also needs "make"
[03:14] <defrysk> A3n, try asking , how do I install ndiswrapper ?
[03:14] <A3n> and gcc
[03:14] <A3n> ive searched alot for other options
[03:14] <defrysk> A3n, might be a clever move you know
[03:15] <fyrestrtr> A3n: put your install media in the CDROM/DVDROM drive.
[03:15] <tabman> can you play rm and wmv files on ubuntu ?
[03:15] <hastesaver> tabman, yes
[03:15] <A3n> my wireless card doesnt have a linux support
[03:15] <hastesaver> !restricted | tabman

[03:15] <dcordes> i installed linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r), rebooted and still "sudo nano /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common: No such file or directory"
[03:15] <fyrestrtr> A3n: then, start a terminal (hit alt+f2, type gnome-terminal and hit enter). Then, type sudo apt-get install build-essential, when it asks for password, type your password and hit enter.
[03:16] <A3n> i have no internet remmember
[03:16] <tigerman> Anyone know of a good program that can recover a damaged superblock?
[03:16] <fyrestrtr> tigerman: the program that restores your backup? :)
[03:16] <HymnToLife> dcordes, but why do you want to do that ?

[03:16] <tigerman> fyrestrtr: WUZZ
[03:16] <A3n> i am
[03:16] <DarkED> if I cant use partition magic, anyone know a good way to resize an ntfs partition to make a ubuntu partition when i install?
[03:17] <A3n> i tried apt-get already
[03:17] <A3n> but it wont work without internet
[03:17] <HymnToLife> DarkED : GParted
[03:17] <defrysk> A3n, yes it will
[03:17] <hastesaver> DarkED, the ubuntu installation CD has its own partition manager
[03:17] <fyrestrtr> A3n: what error do you get?
[03:17] <hastesaver> DarkED, and it's called gparted
[03:17] <dcordes> HymnToLife: the binary drivers guide for ati drivers in the wiki tells me to. and i suspect that if this file doesn't exist, i have no restricted modules
=== Ring_Donut is now known as Ring_Donut^away
[03:17] <A3n> that it couldnt apt-get build-essential
[03:17] <tigerman> fyrestrtr: lets pretend its the backup that lost its superblock :p
[03:17] <hastesaver> DarkED, but you could also try resizing it from Windows itself, if Windows has such a feature :-)
[03:17] <DarkED> hastesaver: yes but last i heard gparted won't work on ntfs partitions
[03:17] <HymnToLife> dcordes, could you paste the link top the Wiki ?
[03:17] <A3n> didnt try in gnome mode though
[03:18] <DarkED> hastesaver: no, it doesnt, and the only partitioners worth anything are pay apps =/
[03:18] <dcordes> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI "Make sure fglrx is not disabled: sudo gedit /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common"
[03:18] <HymnToLife> hastesaver, it doesn't
[03:18] <fyrestrtr> A3n: what error do you get with apt-get?
[03:18] <HymnToLife> DarkED, GParted is the bes partitionning app you could ask for
[03:18] <hastesaver> !fuse
[03:18] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[03:18] <fyrestrtr> dcordes: just check if its not blacklisted.
[03:18] <A3n> cant remember exactly, it said something about not being able to apt-get build-essential
[03:18] <HymnToLife> and it is free, as in freedom :p
[03:18] <Hoag> Hey again. One last thing I'm trying to sort. I have a wine command that has the desired effect through a terminal, but it doesn't act the same from a launcher. What's up with that?
[03:18] <dcordes> fyrestrtr: how do i do so?
[03:18] <hastesaver> fyrestrtr, he doesn't have internet
[03:19] <fyrestrtr> hastesaver: that's fine that he doesn't.
[03:19] <DarkED> HymnToLife: yeah, unless you are resizing an ntfs partition, which gparted will destroy, and what i need to do :D
[03:19] <fyrestrtr> !blacklist | dcordes
[03:19] <ubotu> dcordes: To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add "blacklist modulename" to the end of that list
[03:19] <kenny> !
[03:19] <HymnToLife> DarkED, NTFS resizing in GParted works perfectly well
[03:19] <DaGame> Hey, I'm looking for some music library software for linux, what do y'all recommend?
[03:19] <jrib> DaGame: amarok
[03:19] <DarkED> HymnToLife: have you tried it? ;)
[03:19] <kenny> DaGame, which de?
[03:19] <HymnToLife> countless times
[03:19] <A3n> so the build-essential is on the shipped cd i got?
[03:20] <DaGame> kenny, undecided lol
[03:20] <DarkED> HymnToLife: and it didn't destroy every file on the ntfs partition!?
[03:20] <A3n> (dapper drake 6.06)
[03:20] <jrib> A3n: yes
[03:20] <fyrestrtr> A3n: open a terminal window, and type this : grep deb-cdrom /etc/apt/sources.list
[03:20] <A3n> k
[03:20] <jrib> as wel as ndiswrapper stuff
[03:20] <A3n> thanks
[03:20] <kenny> DaGame, well cant go wrong with amarok
[03:20] <A3n> ill come back it if isnt working
[03:20] <HymnToLife> DarkED, nope, or I wouldn't tell you to use it :p
[03:20] <Hoag> Never mind, resolved!
[03:21] <HymnToLife> just run a defrag and a chkdsk /f before, just to make sure
[03:21] <dcordes> fyrestrtr: it isn't blacklisted
[03:21] <fyrestrtr> dcordes: then you can proceed, perhaps the wiki is outdated.
[03:21] <DarkED> HymnToLife: okay... well, all I know is, I basically killed a new hdd because I used gparted to resize an ntfs partition. it filled the disk with bad sectors
[03:22] <HymnToLife> that's weird
[03:22] <fyrestrtr> DarkED: that's a bit ... ermm ... rediculous.
[03:22] <HymnToLife> as I tell you, I've done it countless times and never a single problem
[03:22] <cox377> is there a comand for finding thr free total/free space on hdd;s?
[03:22] <HymnToLife> df
[03:22] <fyrestrtr> df -h
[03:22] <HymnToLife> -h is for n00bz :p
[03:22] <DarkED> fyrestrtr: if a hard drive is nothing but bad sectors, it basically becomes useless, since nothing would work right on it... so, not all that rediculous...
[03:23] <fyrestrtr> DarkED: the part I meant rediculous was that gparted caused 'bad sectors'.
[03:23] <fyrestrtr> because that's a physical problem, not a logical one.
[03:23] <Ayabara> I have a dvd burninig problem. I have made a 4GB encrypted file (truecrypt). When I try to burn it with the default burner or k3b, they just close the disk without burning anything. Any ideas?
[03:23] <DarkED> fyrestrtr: im not saying it CAUSED the bad sectors, im saying there was a problem during the resize, and THAT caused the bad sectors
[03:24] <M1ch43l> hi @ all
[03:24] <fyrestrtr> Ayabara: make an iso out of it first.
[03:24] <david_> huiber1: Message for when you're back - looks like it's fixed. The volumeid package had segfaulted. Installed it separately then reran and it worked. Package manager now happy, so I'll try a reboot...
=== newb4938 is now known as melter
[03:24] <Ayabara> fyrestrtr, ok. is there a reason why I can't just burn the file?
[03:24] <M1ch43l> who can help me with the following problem : When I try to install/update something, the following message appears :
[03:24] <M1ch43l> There was an error commiting changes. Possibly there was a problem downloading some packages or the commit would break packages.

I boot from cd and select install but after have load kernel, there's a black image with ubuntu and the system don't process with the installation (i've have waited half hour)
[03:27] <toomawaayyy> u know why?
[03:28] <tigerman> does it say kernel panic?
[03:28] <DaGame> what's the way ubuntu updates?
[03:28] <M1ch43l> whats wrong with my adept , when telling: There was an error commiting changes. Possibly there was a problem downloading some packages or the commit would break packages.
[03:28] <Ayabara> how (and in which application) can I make a .iso out of the files I want to burn?
[03:28] <toomawaayyy> no, kernel panic say if i install i386 architect
[03:28] <DaGame> I'm used to gentoo, no versions, everything just updates seperately starting at the bottom.
[03:28] <DaGame> Can ubuntu do this?
[03:29] <defrysk> DaGame, only with dist-upgrades
[03:29] <DaGame> whats dist-upgrades?
[03:29] <defrysk> from one release ti the next
[03:29] <tigerman> toomawaayyy: ive had the same kinda problem a couple of times.. once it was fixed by disconnecting a hdd
[03:29] <defrysk> to*

[03:30] <tigerman> the other time i removed a hdd from a "drawer" mount thing..

[03:30] <tigerman> other than that.. no idea
[03:30] <r00t_> i need help with Cairo-Clock.when i load it. its just showing me white screen
[03:30] <whyameye_> does anybody have LVM on top of RAID working for, say, their home directory? I can't get this working. I've been trying the alternate installer CD then I've been trying to set up the partitions etc. in the LiveCD for the alternate install to recognize. So far no dice....
[03:31] <r00t_> i need help with Cairo-Clock.when i load it. its just showing me white screen
[03:31] <r00t_> any idea ?
[03:32] <hastesaver> DaGame, although of course, all bug fixes and security fixes will get updated daily (or as frequently as they come)
[03:33] <defrysk> DaGame, also compare gentoo current with ubuntu-edgy in distrowatch.com, you'll see that ubuntu is not behind gentoo at all
[03:33] <st3f_> hi all.
[03:34] <davor> st3f_ hello
[03:34] <st3f_> can anyone tell me if it is possible to have a gdesklet always on top?
[03:34] <sysrage> i've followed all the guides ppl keep linking in here but i still can't get wmv's to play :(
[03:34] <DaGame> defrysk, but when the next ubuntu version comes out... what do I do then?
[03:34] <defrysk> DaGame, dist-upgrade or fresh install
[03:34] <orphen> #ubuntu-fr
[03:35] <dcordes> how can i confirm that my restricted modules are installed and loaded?
[03:35] <defrysk> DaGame, fresh install is usually best just make sure to back up
[03:35] <defrysk> DaGame, and if you make a seperate /home you can backup all there :)
[03:36] <defrysk> DaGame, backing up and fresh install takes less time then compiling firefox
[03:36] <DaGame> What about all the apps and settings?
[03:36] <DaGame> How does it know which apps to install?
[03:37] <hastesaver> DaGame, no, you *don't* have to do a fresh install!
[03:37] <hastesaver> DaGame, you can just upgrade, and everything will work. Or at least, it ought to :-)
[03:37] <defrysk> DaGame, default settings are usually fine default install you can choose between kde gnome or xfce4 kubuntu , ubuntu, or xubuntu
[03:38] <hastesaver> defrysk, stop making it look like one has to lose one's settings every six months! :p
[03:38] <DaGame> what about all the apps I've installed after the OS.. how will it know which ones to download + install after the new clean install?
[03:39] <defrysk> DaGame, there is a wiki , a help page and this irc channel in case of need
[03:39] <hastesaver> DaGame, no, if you do a clean install it won't. But as I said, you don't have to a clean install. The recommended way is to simply upgrade.
[03:39] <orphen> i have a problem
[03:39] <orphen> do you know how i can read XML 4.0 in ubuntu?
[03:39] <DaGame> firefox, orphean ?
[03:40] <defrysk> DaGame, just try ubuntu on a seperate partition first to test it and see if you like it and get the hang of it
[03:40] <orphen> i have isntallle internet exploreur IEs 4 Linux
[03:40] <orphen> because i need it
[03:40] <r00t_> i need help with Cairo-Clock.when i load it. its just showing me white screen
[03:40] <r00t_> orion2012,  with xml reader
[03:40] <defrysk> DaGame, if you can run gentoo ubuntu should be a breeze
[03:40] <Ayabara> found out how to make an iso, but can someone tell me why I can't burn a 4GB file directly?
[03:40] <r00t_> oops sorry orion2012
[03:40] <r00t_> orphean, you can use firefox to read xml
[03:40] <hastesaver> r00t_, wrong person again :-)
[03:40] <orphen> it is for tranding
[03:41] <orphen> trading
[03:41] <DaGame> Ayabara, because CDs are stored in an iso format.. there are some programs that can convert to iso and burn at the same time but that's just 1 program doing 2 steps which can also be done with 2 seperate programs :P
[03:42] <orphen> i will try
[03:42] <r00t_> lol hastesaver
[03:42] <DevC> ok, million dollar question.......what do I need to install to have KDE on Ubuntu?
[03:42] <hastesaver> DevC, the package kubuntu-desktop
[03:42] <HymnToLife> depends of what you want of KDE
[03:42] <r00t_> orphean,, google : xml 4 reader for ubuntu
[03:42] <defrysk> !info kubuntu-desktop
[03:42] <ubotu> kubuntu-desktop: Kubuntu desktop system. In component main, is optional. Version 1.22 (edgy), package size 13 kB, installed size 40 kB
[03:42] <r00t_> hastesaver,  :P yeah
[03:42] <DevC> oh ok :)
[03:42] <HymnToLife> kde-core <= just essential KDE suff
[03:42] <hastesaver> DevC, kubuntu-desktop is quite a lot, actually... you might be able to do with much less :-)
[03:43] <HymnToLife> kubuntu-desktop <= default Kubuntu install
[03:43] <HymnToLife> kde <= full KDE
[03:43] <hastesaver> Ayabara, what do you mean you can't burn it directly? There are lots of programs that can burn it directly
[03:43] <Ayabara> DaGame, but it works to burn smaller files without making a iso first. why is it different with larger files?
[03:43] <Bambi21> Hi...I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to get my ubuntu server to respond with a text string when pinged?
[03:43] <hastesaver> Ayabara, you can write on the fly, of course. k3b has this, at least
[03:43] <stoorty> hello what is the default password for the root account when installin from the live cd?
[03:43] <hastesaver> !root
[03:43] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:43] <HymnToLife> there is none
[03:43] <dcordes> how can i remove a user?
[03:43] <defrysk> stoorty, just enter
[03:43] <Ayabara> hastesaver, I tried to burn a 4GB file with both the default burner and k3b, but they just closed the dvd without writing anything..
[03:43] <linxeh> Bambi21: how do you mean? respond on the console? or ?
[03:44] <HymnToLife> sudo -i   will get you a root terminal without asking for a password
[03:44] <hastesaver> dcordes, go to System->Administration->Users and groups
[03:44] <stoorty> thanks defrysk
[03:44] <saladin> i am trying to boot live cd ( edgy) and i get this error : "/bin/sh: cant access tty : job control turned off"  .i goodled this error ,but it cannot find a common solution . any ideas out there
[03:44] <dcordes> hastesaver
[03:44] <r00t_> HymnToLife,  doesnt work :)
[03:44] <dcordes> command?
[03:44] <DevC> HymnToLife: pardon my stupidity but what is the difference between kubuntu-desktop and kde?
[03:44] <hastesaver> Ayabara, I don't have a DVD burner, but at least for CDs I can burn directly with k3b. I don't see why it should be different with DVDs...
[03:45] <HymnToLife> DevC, kubuntu-desktop will install the same thing as a default Kubuntu install
[03:45] <hastesaver> dcordes, userdel , IIRC
[03:45] <HymnToLife> kde will install full KDE
[03:45] <Bambi21> no, I mean when I ping my server I want it to send along with the respons a string that says something like "Its me!"...something like that....doesnt have to be with the ping, jus to the machine that pinged it.
[03:45] <Ayabara> hastesaver, I can't see why it shouldn't work either :-/ , k3b said something about files larger than 2GB and activated a UDF plugin or something.
[03:45] <HymnToLife> which has a lot of extra stuff compared to kubuntu-dektop
[03:46] <beerockxs> I'm having a weird problem, whenever I install a new kernel, the entry in grub points to a non-existing harddisk, hd(1,0)
[03:46] <frogzoo> Bambi21: probly google 'port knocking'
[03:46] <hastesaver> HymnToLife, you mean the other way round, right?
[03:46] <hastesaver> Ayabara, it's probably a setting somewhere. Anyway, I shouldn't speak about this because I don't know about dvd burning :-)
[03:46] <beerockxs> I think it's because I had 2 HDDs installed when I installed Ubuntu first.
[03:46] <HymnToLife> beerockxs, edit the automagic kernel options in /boot/grum/menu.lst
[03:46] <linxeh> Bambi21: I guess you need something with iptables then, and to trigger an external command when yo uget a ping. I dont understand why you would want to do such a thing though
[03:46] <Bambi21> I will try prot knocking
[03:46] <hastesaver> HymnToLife, kubuntu-desktop = kde + (lots of KDE apps)
[03:46] <hastesaver> HymnToLife, right?
[03:46] <Ayabara> hastesaver, :-) , thanks for your help
[03:46] <HymnToLife> hastesaver, nope :p
[03:47] <linxeh> Bambi21: and what is the remote machine meant to do with the string ?
[03:47] <RawSewage> what filesystem does Windows use
[03:47] <defrysk> Ayabara, growisofs -Z /dev/dvd /path/to/folder/
[03:47] <hastesaver> HymnToLife, really? could you clarify?
[03:47] <HymnToLife> hmm, well
=== reus is now known as megar0m
[03:47] <linxeh> RawSewage: depends - FAT16, FAT32, NTFS
[03:47] <HymnToLife> kde is a metapackage that installs all the package of the standard KDE distribution
[03:47] <RawSewage> linxeh, XP standrad
[03:47] <HymnToLife> the same you find in Debian for ex.
[03:48] <RawSewage> linxeh, the most common for XP
[03:48] <HymnToLife> and kubuntu-desktop is a Kubuntu specific meta
[03:48] <linxeh> RawSewage: depending on the version of windows. Windows XP uses NTFS by default, but some prebuilt machines have it on FAT32
[03:48] <tvnz> hi
[03:48] <RawSewage> linxeh, tyvm
[03:48] <beerockxs> thanks HymnToLife
[03:48] <linxeh> RawSewage: on linux you should try mounting as vfat or ntfs
[03:48] <HymnToLife> will instal also Kubuntu-related stuff (artwork and such)
=== Ring_Donut^away is now known as Ring_Donut
[03:48] <tvnz> how to make beryl-xgl start whit gnome?
[03:48] <RawSewage> linxeh, ok
[03:48] <linxeh> RawSewage: you may need to modprobe the ntfs driver
[03:48] <Ayabara> defrysk, thanks. found "mkisofs -r -o file.iso /location_of_folder/" in the wiki. each will work I guess
[03:48] <hastesaver> HymnToLife, hmm... right. I just saw that kde is a *huge* metapackage; I thought it would just install the core libs or something :-)
[03:48] <RawSewage> Im just making a small partition with gparted so I can install Windows and play Second Life
[03:49] <defrysk> Ayabara, -R indeed
[03:49] <defrysk> -r that is
[03:49] <HymnToLife> nope, to install just the KDE core stuff it's kde-core
[03:49] <defrysk> forgot to mention that flag
[03:49] <defrysk> Ayabara, growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -R -J /path/to/files
[03:49] <hastesaver> tvnz, try asking in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:49] <DevC> now I'm debating between kde or the kubuntu install.....does either one come with kdevelop? I know a lot of linux OSes sometimes drop out Kdevelop with KDE
[03:49] <HymnToLife> then you have kde-games, kde-graphics, kde-multimedia, kde-extras...
[03:49] <HymnToLife> and kde installs al of them
[03:49] <defrysk> Ayabara, no iso is made then
[03:49] <HymnToLife> all*
[03:50] <defrysk> Ayabara, and with a rewritable it wil be automatically ereased first
[03:50] <hastesaver> HymnToLife, yes... but kubuntu-desktop also installs a lot of KDE games, graphics and multimedia apps etc... so I got confused :-)
[03:50] <HymnToLife> DevC, you could always install kdevelop later
[03:50] <Bambi21> linxeh: I would want to do this because I have server setup that changes IP's all the time, but the IP's are all in a certain range and I want to try out all the IP's and find my server by looking for the right respons to a ping. If you could suggest any better way I would be glad to give that a try:).
[03:50] <Ayabara> defrysk, thanks :-)
[03:51] <DevC> ok I'll just do the kubuntu install Cause I like going between KDE and Gnome depending on my mood
[03:51] <HymnToLife> hastesaver, kubuntu-desktop is something like a selection, the Kubuntu developpers put in there what they thought would be nice on a basic KDE destop, to fit in one CD
[03:51] <defrysk> Ayabara, good read : http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/growisofs1.html
[03:51] <DevC> unless the kubuntu install removes Gnome :o
[03:51] <hastesaver> HymnToLife, yes, I understand now. Thanks
[03:51] <jrib> DevC: nope
[03:51] <defrysk> DevC, nope
[03:51] <defrysk> it just adds
[03:51] <HymnToLife> plus all the Kubuntu-specific stuff like splash screen , KDM theme and so on which is not in the standard KDE
[03:51] <hastesaver> DevC, it won't remove anything. Go ahead.
[03:53] <klerfayt> what do commands "laptop-detect" and "laptop_mode" ?
[03:53] <Bambi21> Does anyone have a better idea of how I could do what I ask for in my last post?? I'll give anything a try :).

[04:01] <ProN00b> saladin, your cd is prolly corrupt, did you burn it yourself ?
[04:02] <saladin> ProN00b: i can boot the cd from laptop with no problems.
[04:02] <frogzoo> hastesaver: my bad, soz dunno
[04:02] <ProN00b> could be scratched maybe, saladin ?
[04:03] <beerockxs> Anyone know why Suspend To Ram would not work correctly on a nforce5 mobo?
[04:04] <Ayabara> defrysk, from the man pages it seems you can append with -M to a disk where you initially burned with -Z

[04:10] <hastesaver> Tolo, the version numbers are actually dates.
[04:10] <Jellow> hi folks
[04:10] <frogzoo> Tolo: they're both supported 6.10 is more recent & will boot faster
[04:10] <hastesaver> Tolo, 6.06 is the 2006 June version and 6.10 is the 2006 October version.

[04:12] <hastesaver> M3G4crux, no, it probably means that the file doesn't exist or something

[04:14] <frogzoo> GreyGhost: I'm facing the same dillema - 6.06 is LTS & 6.10 isn't - also, I'm happy with dapper so can't see the case to upgrade for my needs atm
[04:14] <hastesaver> GreyGhost, yes, go ahead. Edgy is not very different from 6.06 to be honest... but it's faster and has newer version of programs. (Some people had problems upgrading... although it shouldn't happen, you might consider doing a fresh install if you want to upgrade)
[04:14] <frogzoo> GreyGhost: it's not actually compulsory to upgrade every 6 months

However, the current version in the ubuntu repositories is myth 0.20, but I need myth 0.19.  I have a repo setup that has 0.19 I believe, but synaptic shows me only some 0.19 versions, ones that aren't usurped by .20 version in the ubuntu repo.

[04:22] <dcordes> when i login with my root account it works fine. but with the added user it won't work
[04:23] <desaparecidoo> Any problems on this notebook?
[04:23] <dter> how do I delete a package including dependencies?
[04:23] <dter> like 'kdebase'
[04:23] <desaparecidoo> or some How to?

[04:23] <Aldoliel> frogzoo, I've done that, it's just that whenever I print to the shared printer, it never actually prints, just seems to sit in the queue on the windows box
[04:23] <Tank> I have chosen a partition as / but it tells me I didn't :/
[04:23] <hastesaver> dter, apt-get autoremove , I think. I'm not sure
[04:23] <dter> hold on
[04:23] <Aldoliel> desaparecidoo, Don't see why there would be, more details might help though
[04:24] <sceo> tank: I think / needs to be on a primary, not a logical
[04:24] <derFlo> how can i burn a xvid movie to a dvd that every standard dvd player can play it?
[04:24] <dter> doesnt work =[
[04:24] <whyameye_> dapper LiveCD: raid1 is active according to dmesg but it doesn't appear to be mounted and I can't seem to mount it.
[04:25] <dcordes> i would really appreaciate it if somebody could scroll up and check for my pure_ftp user problem
[04:25] <frogzoo> Aldoliel: have you tried the jet direct protocol ?
[04:25] <stojance> Can someone help?
[04:25] <stojance> !nvidia
[04:25] <Tank> sceo: Thanks, can i make it primary instead of logical in any way?
[04:25] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:25] <Aldoliel> frogzoo, What is that?
[04:25] <zspada15> how do i align my printer?
[04:25] <zspada15> !printer
[04:25] <ubotu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows

[04:26] <derFlo> how can i burn a xvid movie to a dvd that every standard dvd player can play it?
[04:26] <sceo> tank: during the partitioning process you'll need to do that; also, I think you're limited to 4 primary partitions
[04:27] <Aldoliel> Thanks, I'll look into it
[04:27] <stojance> !nvidia beta
[04:27] <frogzoo> sceo: best to use one of the primaries as an extended partition
[04:27] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidia beta - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:28] <hastesaver> derFlo, I don't know, because I've never tried it, but there is a KDE app called qdvdauthor that looked promising.
[04:28] <derFlo> hastesaver, thanks for the tip
[04:29] <zspada15> anyone familiar with aligning print cartgriges with lexmarks?
[04:29] <gavin_> I'm trying to install menumaker, and the website just says "/configure; make; make install sequence", can anyone explain what it means by that?
[04:29] <Tank> sceo: Okay, thanks for helping, I'll try to figure it out :)
[04:29] <zylche> do ./configure in the directory
[04:30] <gavin_> ok, i got that far
[04:30] <Aldoliel> Hmmm... I don't think I can  use JetDirect, I'm using windows to share the printer....
[04:30] <zylche> then make
[04:30] <zylche> then make install sequence
[04:30] <zylche> it's the order of commands
[04:30] <gavin_> yes, but make doesn't find anything
[04:30] <hastesaver> gavin_, wait, what is menu maker, and why isn't there an equivalent in the repos? :-)
[04:30] <zspada15> i really need to align this cartigdes
[04:30] <zylche> hm..
[04:30] <Aldoliel> zspada15, Isn't there an option to do it from the front panel?
[04:31] <gavin_> hastesaver: I'm not sure why, its for editing the debian menu system.
[04:31] <gavin_> hastesaver: i.e. with fluxbox.
[04:31] <NET||abuse> hey guys, anyone know about amd64 flash availability at all??

[04:32] <slipttees> hello
[04:32] <Nazcafan> s/j/\/j
[04:32] <gavin_> hastesaver: it very well could, I was told to look at menumaker, that's all.
[04:32] <Aldoliel> zspada15, Doesn't it do it automatically, it should only use two pages or thereabouts
[04:32] <slipttees> writer on partition hfs+ of Mac OS X 10.4.8?
[04:32] <hastesaver> gavin_, try alacarte menu editor. it's in the repos; easier and safer to install it
[04:33] <gavin_> hastesaver: its for gnome
[04:33] <kinematix> hi guys, did anyone here managed to have xgl working?

[04:33] <zspada15> Aldoliel, but i dont know how/what to print
[04:33] <Aldoliel> Oh, right...
[04:33] <hastesaver> gavin_, oh, sorry :-) (For a moment, I forgot that fluxbox was a WM and thought it was a media player or something :-))

[04:36] <fenrig> what for is the alternative ubuntu cd for?
[04:36] <slipttees> zspada15: help me man!
[04:36] <zspada15> slipttees, read the linnk
[04:36] <gavin_> zylche: there is a generic install readme that says I should type "make install", and that compiles some things but it doesn't appear to do what im expecting it to do
[04:36] <hastesaver> fenrig, that's to use if the usual one doesn't work
[04:36] <Aldoliel> fenrig, It's for text mode and server installs...
[04:37] <hastesaver> fenrig, for systems with low RAM, etc.
[04:37] <slipttees> zspada15: already I made everything this and it did not advance!
[04:37] <fenrig> ah
[04:37] <fenrig> so if i have a system with 128ram

[04:37] <zspada15> slipttees, i dont know how to help u
[04:37] <ryanakca> is there a command to output information about your soundcard? lspci gives me the basic stuff, but not enough...
[04:37] <slipttees> :(
[04:38] <slipttees> somebody?
[04:38] <hastesaver> fenrig, I guess so, yes. But are you even sure Ubuntu will run well after installation? (I think it should, but not sure)
[04:38] <fenrig> does anyone
[04:38] <fenrig> knows a distro that is for weak pc's
[04:38] <slipttees> j #mac
[04:38] <fenrig> and looks like ubuntu
[04:38] <fenrig> ?
[04:38] <zspada15> fenrig, ubuntu
[04:38] <zspada15> fenrig, possibly debian
[04:39] <kinematix> is it possible to have the volume control in the upper bar to map to 2 device tracks? I can only point to one and it happens my ICE based chip has distinctive track controls for DAC Left and Right
[04:39] <Reolosi> Will Ubuntu run okay on my older machine -- a P3 with 128MBytes of RAM?
[04:39] <zspada15> Reolosi, it will run awesomely
[04:39] <Reolosi> Really? Even the current release?
[04:39] <huiber1> fenrig: look untu xubuntu
[04:39] <huiber1> !xubuntu
[04:39] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[04:39] <zspada15> Reolosi, it runs on my p2 350 mhz, with only 256 megs of ram
[04:39] <zspada15> edgy
[04:39] <hastesaver> Reolosi, newer releases are being optimised more, AFAICT :-)
[04:40] <slipttees> aaarrrgggg :@
[04:40] <Aldoliel> Reolosi, you'd be better with xubuntu considering the amount of ram
[04:40] <slipttees> :(
[04:40] <stro> hi
[04:40] <Reolosi> Why is Xubuntu better for weak systems?
[04:40] <hastesaver> fenrig, you can use Ubuntu. Try it and see. If it is very slow, you can still use Ubuntu, but something other than GNOME (like XFCE (xubuntu) or something)
[04:40] <Fortis> can I run KDE apps under GNOME?
=== stoorty is now known as stoorty^gone
[04:40] <hastesaver> Fortis, yes
[04:40] <zspada15> Aldoliel, how about my printer?
[04:40] <stro> anybody got the intel high definition audio running on edgy? it's also called 82801G
[04:40] <Fortis> ok
[04:41] <hastesaver> Reolosi, because XFCE requires less resources? But this is a circular answer... the only answer is "because." :-)
[04:41] <fenrig> and uhm
[04:41] <stro> another problem ... when i use compiz, the active window dashes off to another virtual screen as soon as i press 'Alt'
[04:41] <fenrig> what are the recommends
[04:41] <fenrig> of ubuntu?
[04:41] <zspada15> Reolosi, XFCE is affectionately known as the cholesterol free environment
[04:42] <pecisk> which package contains Caplets in System => Preferences and Administration?
[04:42] <John_poot> Yeah, well - 4 years since I infested IRC....  the device is 006:001, supposedly connected to nothing.
[04:42] <Aldoliel> zspada15, I'm still looking, give me a sec
[04:42] <hastesaver> fenrig, what do you mean?
[04:42] <fenrig> when does
[04:43] <fenrig> no
[04:43] <fenrig> with what amount of take ram does ubuntu feels comfortable using
[04:43] <Reolosi> Well, thanks hastesaver and aldoliel, downloading the newest Xubuntu now... hopefully it works on my machine, the last 2 distros I tried didn't
[04:44] <huiber1> fenrig: >256
[04:44] <fenrig> ah

[04:50] <huiber1> noob001: it depends heavily on your wifi card
[04:50] <r7^black> what dus tht mean?
[04:50] <davor> klees yeah, i think what you need to find out first is exactly where the problem occurs. is it that it tries to play the sound and that it doesn't work, or is it having trouble sensing the event. it might even be that the configuration program actually isn't writing what you want it to, to the conf-file.

I can then reinstall the driver and X will start fine, but then when I reboot... same thing.
[05:46] <Jimmey> I want to get Gnome working without having to install Ubuntu-Desktop. What packages should I install on top of a server install?
[05:46] <huiber1> noob001: the patchfile would be a textfile containing the text in the link (the prgramm not the blahblah)
[05:46] <mixo8114> as for raghu206, i'll try and find out, soz for waiting

[05:47] <Zehrila> usr13: I finally managed installing Edgy and the only installation I could manage was a commandline-only one, from the alternative CD. Now I want to set it up with the GUI etc.
[05:47] <Spee_Der> Zehrila, what's up ? I just got home from work 1/2 day.
[05:47] <huiber1> noob001: you need at least the sourcecode for the networkmanager package, and the gnome-dev packeges
[05:47] <Jimmey> Zehrila, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[05:47] <Jimmey> :-P
[05:47] <mixo8114> raghu, can u repeat, my server temporatialy broke
[05:47] <Zehrila> usr13: But I need to be able to do it using the packages available on the disc, rather than from the internet, since I'm on dialup and can't manage connecting using commandline.
[05:47] <noob001> and i apply the patch to the networtkmanager source and the gnome-dev packeges?
[05:47] <mixo8114> can u repeat the q

[05:47] <huiber1> noob001: but like the kernel doc say in many places: "If oyu don't know ehat this is all about, you probably don't need it"
[05:47] <Zehrila> Spee_Der: Not much my end, just sorting Ubuntu out. =] 
[05:48] <Zehrila> How was the day at work?
[05:48] <noob001> i want wpa
[05:48] <Jimmey> Zehrila, edit /etc/apt/sources.list so that only the CD source is uncommented, then sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[05:48] <huiber1> noob001: no the patch only alters the networkmanager
[05:48] <Spee_Der> Nice and easy, for change.....
[05:48] <Magilla> where's a good place to ask a shell scripting question?
[05:48] <whyameye> when ubuntu updates the kernel, the only kernel is left in the /boot partition. Can this simply be deleted?
[05:48] <whyameye> sorry only == old
[05:48] <noob001> it's supposed to make wpa_supplicant work with madewifi-ng
[05:48] <Spee_Der> On the tele with the pound trying to locate another dog.....
[05:48] <huiber1> noob001: I wnat a ferrari and a big house, GIMME NOW!!
[05:48] <mixo8114> lol
[05:48] <Spee_Der> Hey, good luck with Ubuntu, it is great stuff.....
[05:49] <noob001> sure but first you gimme my WPA!
[05:49] <mixo8114> raghu206, can u repeat that plz
[05:49] <Zehrila> Jimmey: Alright, let me try that. One more thing...do I simply specify the CD drive as the source or do I need to provide the exact path on the CD drive?
[05:49] <huiber1> noob001:it's a deal
[05:49] <raghu206> mixo8114, how to set classpath ;?
[05:49] <mixo8114> ok
[05:49] <Roconda> how can I execute /usr/bin/whoami in bash?
[05:49] <jku_> whyameye, yes, but make sure the new kernel works first
[05:49] <Zehrila> Jimmey: And another thing; once I install ubuntu-desktop, would it make the whole system exactly like it would be in a default GUI installation? And would the GUI load by default when booting?
[05:49] <Jimmey> Zehrila, you don't need to specify the drive. Infact, just make sure that all other sources that aren't  marked as a CDROM are commented out, and you should be fine. The CDROM source is already specified
[05:49] <noob001> and this is ubuntu suposedly a nice simple distro of linux
[05:49] <Jimmey> Zehrila, yes
[05:49] <Kingsqueak> Roconda: just type that and hit enter
[05:50] <Zehrila> Jimmey: Oh, alright. That sounds fine and dandy. =] 
[05:50] <whyameye> using broadcom BCM4306 with ndiswrapper. WEP doesn't work. I know my basic WEP config is good because I have WEP working on several other laptops with dapper as well. Anything I should check?
[05:50] <huiber1> noob001: if you read the hardware compat list before buying a wifi card, you wouldn't have this problem
[05:50] <Zehrila> I'll just reboot and give it a shot. Thanks again, ciao everyone!
[05:50] <noob001> is there another way to get wpa with madwifi-ng without wpa_supplicant
[05:50] <noob001> the compability list says madwifi
[05:50] <bobesponja> hey all
[05:50] <Acu> greetings, i would like to install apache 2.2.3 php5 and php my admin and i do not now why i was not able to make it work - is any order i should install them e.g mysql, apache, php5, phpmyadmin ?
[05:51] <huiber1> noob001: don't blame ubuntu, blame your card manufacturer for not support linux at all
[05:51] <Roconda> Kingsqueak: I mean in a script
[05:51] <bobesponja> is there a package for aiglx in edgy? I can't see it with apt-cache search
[05:51] <noob001> well the card works out of box with ubuntu just no madwifi
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> Roconda: same thing, as you type it on the commandline, is how you can put it in the script
[05:51] <noob001> no wpa i mean
[05:51] <Silleke> exit
[05:51] <Silleke> quit
[05:51] <huiber1> noob001: compat list say madwifi for wpa, or for working wifi?
[05:51] <noob001> wpa_supplicant says madwifi
[05:52] <noob001> http://mail.gnome.org/archives/networkmanager-list/2006-March/msg00152.html but according to this madwifi-ng doesn't support WEXT
[05:52] <huiber1> noob001: then you might be lucky settingup wpa from a commandline, not the gnome network mananger
[05:52] <Roconda> Kingsqueak: if [  "/usr/bin/whoami" != "root" ]  ; then, wont work
[05:52] <noob001> i tried it gives me

[05:58] <meherenOS-X> how do i set my keymap to dvorak (i don't have X)
[05:58] <MrStein> Virogenesis: you don't need to kill X. You need to open a terminal.
[05:58] <mixo8114> and encryptions take longer to break
[05:58] <Jimmey> Virogenesis, CTRL + ALT + F2 + Wait a bit.
[05:58] <Virogenesis> how do you do that?

[06:30] <feydin> In xen-hotplug.log I see a lot of "trap 53: bad trap" error. Anyone have this problem or advice to solve it (xen-3.03, ubuntu edgy, amd64)? I also replaced #!/bin/sh by #!/bin/bash in the scripts located in /etc/xen/scripts but still no luck :(

[07:46] <Elda> At least when I got online through the ethernet I had to reboot with it plugged in, and I had to make sure the device selected for the internet was eth0
[07:46] <princemackenzie> is there something bleeding edge you are after, freight
[07:46] <biesi> I'm trying to use a voodoo 3 video card with ubuntu 6.10, and X keeps crashing, any suggestions?
[07:47] <biesi> (FC4 was working fine)
[07:47] <Elda> video card drivers? :s  Only a guess
[07:47] <freight> I want minimalistic Ubuntu. should I get server iso then install my stuff?
[07:47] <HamsDa1> hello, again, guys
[07:47] <lamego> FriedCPU, or alternate cd, and use the minimal option
[07:47] <princemackenzie> freight, yes, install a server and then go from there
[07:47] <SNowborn> hm, wanna mount a remote file system via ssh/sshfs on a 6.10, but after creating the folder in /media and trying to mount, it does not work. Maybe need to compile sth for sshfs into the kernel first? installed packages "shfs-source,shfs-utils,sshfs"
[07:48] <freight> will it shut down my box?
[07:48] <biesi> oh, also: how do I tell ubuntu that my system clock is in UTC?

[07:49] <freight> what server iso includes?
[07:49] <SNowborn> @HamsDa1: set an dns server in network config?
[07:49] <HamsDa1> yes
[07:49] <tim|iBook> How do you make VLC the default video player in ubuntu
[07:49] <SNowborn> same as your gateway?
[07:49] <princemackenzie> freight, its ubuntu with no desktop environment.
[07:50] <HamsDa1> network connection is already configured
[07:50] <freight> curl?
[07:50] <freight> it includes LAMP?
[07:50] <SNowborn> but u set DNS + Gateway both?
[07:50] <SNowborn> hm,k
[07:50] <princemackenzie> freight, as far as i know it does
[07:50] <princemackenzie> freight do you have old hardware
[07:50] <HamsDa1> yes, snowborn
[07:50] <freight> could I make custom install?
[07:51] <gray> hi all, i'm looking for some help setting up SVN =)
[07:51] <princemackenzie> freight, i suppose: install a server and then just add the pieces you want from there
[07:51] <HamsDa1> btw: I'm using DHCP now
[07:51] <Qwerty> wow Flash 9 out on edgy :D
[07:51] <alecjw> wehn i open my address book in evolution, it goes to Local/Anniversery, how can i make it go to Local/
[07:51] <SNowborn> you behind a router?
[07:51] <princemackenzie> qwerty, yeah, that was pretty cool
[07:51] <alecjw> All instead
[07:51] <ivx> hey is there a limit to how much ram ubuntu can support, and will it support sata
[07:52] <HamsDa1> yes, I am, snowborn
[07:52] <freight> will sever install shut down my ACPI box
[07:52] <alecjw> soz - pressed enter halfway through a message
[07:52] <gray> anyone know how to set up SVN as a service?
[07:52] <SNowborn> router's ip set as gateway + dns server?
[07:52] <princemackenzie> ivx it supports a lot of sata chipsets.  not sure about the ram limit, but its assuredly pretty high
[07:52] <HamsDa1> yes, snowborn ^^
[07:52] <gray> i would really appreciate any pointers you could give me
[07:52] <Lam_> samba:  public, browseable, available.  what do each of those mean?
[07:52] <Arigato> how do I burn a bin/cue file?
[07:52] <ivx> princemackenzie, so if i get some sata hds you think it will be good?
[07:53] <SNowborn> hm, if the router then has a dns server configured / set by the hoster, no clue, sorry :/
[07:53] <alecjw> Arigato: you need to convert it to an iso first. i'll just work out how
[07:53] <HamsDa1> np, snowborn, thanks for your time anyway =)
[07:53] <princemackenzie> ivx you need to find out the chipset that runs the sata on your motherboard.  im running of an nforce sata drive as we speak.
[07:53] <SNowborn> anyone a clue about the sshfs?
[07:53] <klees> is it me or starting Amarok for the first time takes a long long time??  (Ubuntu Gnome)
[07:53] <tim|iBook> How do you make VLC the default video player in ubuntu?
[07:53] <SNowborn> HamsDa1: you're welcome :P
[07:54] <PingunZ> Hi, what's the default ubuntu font ?
[07:54] <princemackenzie> ivx unless its obscure or really new, i wouldn't fear that its not supported, it probably is.
[07:54] <gray> i have svn installed, but i would like remote access to it
[07:54] <alecjw> SNowborn: i know a little about it
[07:54] <HamsDa1> thx =)
[07:54] <gray> and i'm having a bit of trouble
[07:54] <Qwerty> PingunZ, Sans mostly
[07:54] <ivx> princemackenzie, i am thinking of buying http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2665520&sku=MBM-RD480-3700
[07:54] <PingunZ> ok ty qwerty
[07:54] <gray> because i know you people are really smart
[07:54] <SNowborn> i wanna mount a drive via ssh / sshfs
[07:54] <dv_> hm after using beryl for a while, "normal" gnome looks so plain...

[07:56] <julian_> some on in the forums that the following: "The modified hal & pmount that i provide in the main-all channel," what is the main all channel and where do i find it ?

[07:57] <alecjw> !es | BAKALA007
[07:57] <ubotu> BAKALA007: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[07:57] <BAKALA007> mmm SNowborn jajaja hola
[07:57] <ivx> princemackenzie, cool, I got an okay job so I finally can start playing with this stuff
[07:57] <ivx> princemackenzie, thanks
[07:57] <princemackenzie> ivx, no worries, building a desktop machine?
[07:57] <SNowborn> already created a folder in /media, but after trying to mount, i get a bad link
[07:57] <ivx> princemackenzie, no, a server that isn't going to be that busy, so that should be plenty
[07:57] <princemackenzie> ivx can i give you some unsolicited hardware advice/
[07:58] <HamsDa1> does somebody know, how to install VMWare tools under ubuntu?
[07:58] <SNowborn> alecjw: got a clue? / need more info?
[07:58] <kr0n1x> hi men, what is Mono????
[07:58] <ivx> princemackenzie, yes, i would love it, just rember i am trying to keep it cheap
[07:58] <ArrenLex> !mono | kr0n1x
[07:58] <ubotu> mono: Mono CLI (.NET) runtime. In component main, is optional. Version 1.1.17.1-1ubuntu7 (edgy), package size 1 kB, installed size 24 kB
[07:58] <tim|iBook> How do you make VLC the default video player in ubuntu?
[07:58] <princemackenzie> ivx, i would go with an AM2 motherboard cause thats the future, and DDR2 ram tends to be a little cheaper
[07:58] <freight> who did minimal server install?
[07:58] <HamsDa1> hmm...ok, thanks for your time, I'm going to sleep =)
[07:58] <Elda> Or is there a way to completely "uninstall" to try again? :s
[07:59] <kr0n1x> thanks...
[07:59] <princemackenzie> kr0n1x, it is the open source implementation of .NET
[07:59] <HamsDa1> good night ^^
[07:59] <lamego> freight, i did, why ?
[07:59] <alecjw> SNowborn: what do you need to know about it?
[07:59] <gray> hello everyone, having some trouble with SVN, can anyone help?
[07:59] <Lllama> evening all. I'm having problems getting the edgy/universe packages. Gzip errors when I run apt-get update. Anyone else seeing this, or has anyone got some pointers?
[07:59] <kr0n1x> is good princemackenzie ?
[07:59] <lamego> gray, server or client ?
[07:59] <gray> server
[07:59] <princemackenzie> kr0nlx, it depends what you are using it for
[07:59] <kr0n1x> do you like it? i read some blogs and all get shit for this component...
[07:59] <SNowborn> after trying to mount it, i get a bad link / cannot use it as a mount / anything at all :/
[07:59] <freight> lamego: aftre that you installed X and other stuff?
[07:59] <kr0n1x> i don't know princemackenzie :(
[07:59] <julian_> ffs can't someone tell my where to find the main all channel ?
[08:00] <ivx> princemackenzie, yeah i don't know it i can get an am2 for cheap, i was kinda thinking get a board that supports duo core and pentiumd, and just run a pentium d for now
[08:00] <gray> lamego: server.  i installed the package via synaptic
[08:00] <princemackenzie> then i really can't tell you, i would recommended googling for it and reading up
[08:00] <shorty114> julian_, for what?
[08:00] <princemackenzie> kr0nlx
[08:00] <lamego> freight, yes, i have installled the ubuntu desktop later
[08:00] <gray> lamego: but i'm trying to set it up such that i can access it remotely
[08:00] <gray> lamego: which means i need to set up the svnserve, right?
[08:00] <ivx> princemackenzie, or what ever has the same socket number
[08:00] <ashedman> how can I change my character set to unicode ?
[08:00] <lamego> gray, sorry, never setup an svn server :|
[08:00] <princemackenzie> ivx, for sure, and if its not that busy, you don't need much cpu horsepower anyway
[08:00] <julian_> i'm tryin to get write acces on an external device
[08:00] <gray> lamego: ah ok, thx ^^
[08:00] <julian_> ntfs
[08:01] <nothlit> I was creating a modified livecd with reconstructor and it crashed, and for some reason I can't delete any of the files in the folder as root, is there a way I can fix this? rm cannot remove ... operation not permitted
[08:01] <gray> does anyone else know how to set up an SVN Server?
[08:01] <lamego> julian_, there is not write support for ntfs, unless you use ntfs-3g which is a beta driver
[08:01] <julian_> i use nfts-3g
[08:01] <freight> you installed heavy ubuntu-desktop. why? only "LnF" app lovers do this.
[08:01] <princemackenzie> just whatever board you get, find the southbridge and google "linux compatibility nforce sata", for instance, and make sure.  98% of chipsets are probably in as of this point
[08:01] <ivx> princemackenzie, well the one i got now has dual pIII 600 mhz, with 128 rdram. so anything will beat that
[08:01] <julian_> i'm trying ;)
[08:02] <lamego> freight, because I am desktop user, and I have hardware good enough for it
[08:02] <julian_> and because of that i need the 2 files provided in the "main-all channel"
[08:02] <princemackenzie> ivx, haha, for sure.  i use an old pIII as a server as well.
[08:02] <lamego> freight, I love any kind of open source app
[08:02] <tim|iBook> How do you make VLC the default video player in ubuntu?
[08:02] <julian_> The modified hal & pmount that i provide in the main-all channel,
[08:02] <julian_> make NTFS removable device automatically mounted with ntfs-3g.
[08:02] <freight> lamego: I will use wine. the memory G and K like to take is enough for good cs session
[08:02] <ivx> princemackenzie, yeah i got it off ebay for 30 shipped :)
[08:03] <ashedman> how can I change my character set to unicode ?
[08:03] <princemackenzie> ivx, excellent
[08:03] <lamego> ashedman, that should be already your charset
[08:03] <freight> asedman: on console or X?
[08:03] <ashedman> either, really, but X would be nice
[08:03] <ivx> princemackenzie, well it was for a month, now it can't really handle the requests. anyway thanks
[08:03] <sven-tek> iam building a custom 2.6.19 kernel, the system boots until "Freeing unused kernel memory: 284k freed" and then stops with a cursor blinking and allowing me to write. any idea what i could check for - iam running out of ideas ;-)
[08:03] <princemackenzie> ivx no problem
[08:04] <lamego> ashedman, go to System -> Administration -> Language Support
[08:04] <mjr> ashedman, ubuntu uses unicode (utf-8) by default
[08:04] <ashedman> hmm
[08:04] <freight> ashedman: you cant write hebrew?
[08:04] <ashedman> then I wonder why files show different on Windows machines?
[08:04] <Plouj> how about this: can someone suggest a kernel supported PCMCIA/cardbus wireless adapter which has WPA encryption?
[08:04] <lamego> ashedman, because windows is not using unicode ?
[08:04] <SNowborn> alecjw: ?
[08:04] <ashedman> just with characters like vowels with umlaughts and stuff though
[08:05] <ashedman> lamego: I thought Windows did use unicode?
[08:05] <mjr> ashedman, that's too vague to comment
[08:05] <alecjw> SNowborn: what do you need to nkow about sshfs?
[08:05] <lamego> ashedman, I do know there is a mount option to force the charset on the ntfs moutns
[08:06] <ashedman> lamego: I am referring more to other computers.  I make a file with my charset, send the file to a friend, who uses Windows, some of the characters don't show on his end correctly
[08:06] <biesi> how do you send it?
[08:06] <mjr> ashedman, in the content or in file name?
[08:06] <Xenguy> Hi, I need hardware advice - I want to buy a new bigger HD, but all I have used so far is regular ATA drives.  Are there any possible problems with adding a 2nd Ultra-ATA drive (no I don't want SATA at this time).  Will Ubuntu support these Ultra-ATA drives alright?
[08:07] <ashedman> mjr: the file name
[08:07] <lamego> ashedman, it all depends on which software your friends are using
[08:07] <alecjw> Arigato: you have to use bchunk to convert it to an iso
[08:07] <lamego> a lot of windows programs do not support unicode
[08:07] <mjr> ashedman, well, then the issue is in the method of transferring the file
[08:08] <ashedman> mjr: and if the file isn't transferred at all, but the drive itself?
[08:08] <kbrooks> Hi all.
[08:08] <kbrooks> I have a question.
[08:08] <jair> hey guys, I plug a usb external drive on my dapper drake and it mouted where is a read only device, it is a way I can remount it with write permissions even for the users? example umask=000? or something like that?
[08:08] <ashedman> or if I have a dual-boot, and it shows differently depending on the OS?
[08:08] <kbrooks> How do i dual boot Ubuntu and Windows?
[08:08] <biesi> ashedman, what filesystem?
[08:08] <gavuntu> Hi, can anyone help me? Whenever I try to run gksudo, it just says Error copying '/home/gavin/.Xauthority' to '/tmp/libgksu1.2-UHBxUa': Permission, and I can't do anything. Why is it doing this? I can't use many pages in firefox either.
[08:08] <ashedman> biesi: I have noticed the same effect on ext3 and fat32
[08:08] <ArrenLex> !dualboot | kbrooks
[08:08] <ubotu> kbrooks: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[08:09] <biesi> windows can read ext3?
[08:09] <ashedman> biesi: there is a small program I found that works well for it
[08:09] <MZM> biesi: yes*
[08:09] <fuci> What was the command to reconfigure X?
[08:09] <ragnar_123> biesi: yeah, if you use some program...
[08:09] <mjr> ashedman, you may have to spesify utf-8 as a fat32 mount option for correct translation to take place (IIRC iocharset=utf-8, but man mount)
[08:09] <ashedman> biesi: called ext2ifs or something
[08:09] <ArrenLex> gavuntu: paste the output of "ls -ld /tmp"
[08:09] <biesi> well I'd blame ext2ifs then...
[08:09] <mjr> ashedman, as for ext2ifs, it's its problem then
[08:09] <ArrenLex> fuci: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:09] <fuci> ArrenLex: thank you
[08:10] <gavuntu> drwxrwxrwt 15 root root 4096 2006-12-03 04:07 /tmp
[08:10] <kbrooks> ArrenLex, Any tips for accessing my bios?
[08:10] <mjr> ashedman, from ext2ifs FAQ: "Neither different code pages nor UTF-8 encoded file names are supported. The driver always uses the current code page of Windows."
[08:10] <Tominator> hey there got a problem with the beta NVIDIA driver, i installed... how can I uninstall it and install the old one from the official repositorys?
[08:10] <kbrooks> ArrenLex, It looks like a intel bios
[08:10] <ashedman> mjr: oh :P
[08:10] <ArrenLex> kbrooks: ...EFI?
[08:11] <kbrooks> ArrenLex, EFI standing for?
[08:11] <fuci> Ok, that didn't work.
[08:11] <ashedman> alright, thanks all :)
[08:11] <kelbizzle> Can anyone tell me how I uninstall proftpd
[08:11] <ArrenLex> kbrooks: Do you have a mac?
[08:11] <alecjw> when i open my address book in evolution, it goes to Local/Anniversery, how can i make it go to Local/All instead?
[08:11] <nothlit> Tominator, you know 1.0.9629 is no longer beta right?
[08:11] <kelbizzle> i know apt-get remove proftp. isn't there a -purge or something
[08:11] <kbrooks> ArrenLex, macs do not have an accessible BIOS, AFAIK
[08:11] <ArrenLex> kelbizzle: apt-get remove --purge
[08:12] <kelbizzle> thank you
[08:12] <kbrooks> ArrenLex, so I am talking about pcs here
[08:12] <ArrenLex> kbrooks: Macs have EFI. Don't worry about it. Why do you need to access your BIOS?
[08:12] <repartad> nothlit: how do you check which drivers you have?
[08:12] <repartad> nvidia-settings ?
[08:12] <kbrooks> ArrenLex, CD
[08:12] <kelbizzle> ArrenLex, what does the purge option do?
[08:12] <fuci> I can't start GDM and "dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg" doesn't work either. What should I do?
[08:12] <ArrenLex> kbrooks: your system does not boot from CD?
[08:12] <ArrenLex> kelbizzle: purges configuration files.
[08:12] <kelbizzle> ArrenLex, thats what I needed  thanks alot.
[08:12] <kbrooks> ArrenLex, I don't know. I want to see if it does have CD on, and if it doesn't, to turn it on
[08:13] <Tominator> i tried to apt-get remove nvidia glx and just remove the repos "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com edgy lrm" but when I tried to install it again an error appears... (it's in german, so I don't know the right translation ^^)
[08:13] <ArrenLex> kbrooks: I suggest putting a CD into your drive and booting with it, and if it doesn't work, THEN turning it on :)
[08:13] <knoppix> i'm having a difficult time connecting to the internet with ubuntu 6.10 amd64 iso any suggestions?
[08:13] <kinematix> Tominator: perharps you don't have the License key (public key) for that repository?
[08:14] <nothlit> repartad, nvidia-settings can tell you
[08:14] <gavuntu> ArrenLex: drwxrwxrwt 15 root root 4096 2006-12-03 04:07 /tmp
[08:14] <fuci> My xserver-xorg wont start and the reconfigure command doesn't help, it says something like "Xserver-xorg is broke or is not installed"
[08:14] <Tominator> well, don't know :) it installed at first but now it doesn't again...
[08:14] <kinematix> Tominator, personally, I'm right into this right now, I'm trying to have aiglx / beryl to work but as soon as I launch the beryl-manager, it crashes and I lose my windows's decoration
[08:14] <ArrenLex> gavuntu: I heard. I dunno, sorry.
[08:14] <ArrenLex> fuci: then install it. apt-get install xserver-xorg
[08:14] <nothlit> tominator LC_ALL=C apt-get install nvidia-glx (gives you english)
[08:15] <Tominator> that's why I installed them ^^
[08:15] <fuci> ArrenLex: ok, will try that
[08:15] <nothlit> put a sudo in between LC.. and apt-get
[08:15] <knoppix> anyone?
[08:15] <Tominator> thanks
[08:15] <Tominator> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[08:15] <Tominator>   nvidia-glx: Depends: nvidia-kernel-1.0.8776
[08:15] <Tominator> E: Broken packages
[08:15] <Tominator> got a root password set ;)
[08:16] <repartad> I thought glx messed up grub?
[08:16] <Vuen> hey all, i just restarted my computer. is there any way to tell what my uptime was before i restarted?
[08:16] <nothlit> fuci, that means you have a package /installation problem, you can't even worry about configuring it yet
[08:16] <nothlit> repartad, glx has nothing to do with grub
[08:16] <repartad> whats glx?
[08:16] <alecjw> when i open my address book in evolution, it goes to Local/Anniversery, how can i make it go to Local/All instead?
[08:16] <kbrooks> ok, i found the button to press
[08:16] <kbrooks> brb
[08:17] <nothlit> Tominator, are you sure you apt-get update or whatever the command is if you use apt-get
[08:17] <ski-worklap> vuen - run a cron script that does uptime >>/root/penis-size, then less that file after rebooting :)
[08:17] <Lllama> Newbie question: other than changing the link in /usr/bin is there a 'proper' way to change which version of python is used by default?
[08:17] <[^Twen^] > Elda: Im online from another windows computer
[08:17] <fuci> I'm on a blackout here, what was the command to start GDM?
[08:17] <ski-worklap> gdm?
[08:18] <ArrenLex> !alternatives | Lllama
[08:18] <ubotu> Lllama: To change the default applications system-wide, use 'sudo update-alternatives --all' in a terminal.
[08:18] <nothlit> fuci,  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart/start/stop
[08:18] <Tominator> i used it before...
[08:18] <fuci> nothlit: thank you.
[08:18] <ArrenLex> fuci: if you have X installed? "startx"
[08:18] <Lllama> ArrenLex: sweet. Cheers.
[08:18] <nothlit> that doesn't start gdm that starts your window manager
[08:18] <Tominator> uh, buit theres a promblem with:

[08:27] <Tominator> got a question: whats the difference between generic and i386?
[08:27] <eegore> I need a little help in opening ports for an application, what do I have to edit to do that
[08:28] <CITguy> davey - try 'sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart'
[08:28] <madhu> I want to know how to configure dialup in ubuntu
[08:28] <Tominator> or is generic just every x86 platform?
[08:28] <ArrenLex> Tominator: generic replaces everything. i386 is essentially pre-pentium 1 machines.
[08:28] <ArrenLex> !generic
[08:28] <ubotu> Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html

[08:33] <princemackenzie> noelferreira, "killall mozilla-firefox" and then try it again

[08:35] <nothlit> CITguy, man smbclient
[08:35] <princemackenzie> noelferreira, "killall firefox-bin" and then try it, haha
[08:35] <ArrenLex> Jeekay: possible, yes, with apt-pinning. But it's ugly, horrible, dangerous and difficult.
[08:35] <noelferreira> i already did it princemackenzie nothing happens
[08:35] <nothlit> CITguy, i very rarely use it so i can't remember, mostly i just mount shares with smbfs
[08:35] <princemackenzie> noelferreria im stumped
[08:35] <Jeekay> righty... so for a production box i guess i should just bite the bullet and reinstall :) thanks

[08:50] <nothlit> meener, there might be a setting on gconf that turns off opaque windows for metacity
[08:50] <jku_> nothlit, sure. I just "included you in the circulation" since you said it couldn't be done
[08:50] <jerp> http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download#
[08:50] <meener> thanks nothlit - Ill take a look at that
[08:50] <nothlit> jku_, lol no i didn't, i said it  could
[08:50] <shwag> is there a guide for nautilus thumbnails somewhere?  Where are they stored? How long are they stored? Any way to automatically create thumbnails accross a whole drive ?
[08:50] <meener> seems like i should be to leave it on tho, this card can do blitting no problem...
[08:50] <nothlit> shwag, ~/.thumbnails
[08:51] <jku_> ok...
[08:51] <nothlit> shwag, they are stored forever at 128x128 according to the freedesktop specifications
[08:51] <jerp> sasa, that's your North American link, find 6.10 and a location near you and go to town,  "Other Installation Options" is the amd 64 dl
[08:51] <sasa> jerp one last question, sincei installed linux i no longer see theoption of booting in my other hdd that has windows hwo do i go about that?
[08:52] <nothlit> shwag, they are created when an application with a thumbnailing feature comes across one and automatically thumbnails it
[08:52] <sasa> thanks
[08:52] <meener> does 6.10 edgy contain X.org 7.1?
[08:52] <jerp> sasa, come back and we'll deal with that soon enough if it doesn't see it by itself
[08:52] <lebafar> Hey does anyone here know how do I get access in a channel I need to be identified please ?
[08:52] <shwag> nothlit: yah, i want to automate it so I can just sit down and have all of them created in my hundreds of image folders...rather then having to click on each dir and wait.
[08:52] <nothlit> sasa sudo nano -w /boot/grub/menu.lst               then you put the hard drive and partition (they start at 0 ) root (hdx,x)   newline chainloader +1 newline boot
[08:53] <bruenig> !xserver-xorg
[08:53] <ubotu> xserver-xorg: the X.Org X server. In component main, is optional. Version 1:7.1.1ubuntu6 (edgy), package size 164 kB, installed size 584 kB
[08:53] <bruenig> meener, looks like it
[08:53] <sasa> nonhlit i enter thatintotermianl as is
[08:53] <Roconda> !jp
[08:53] <ubotu>  #ubuntu-jp  #kubuntu-jp 
[08:53] <ivx> princemackenzie, oh I just read that that mother board support am2
[08:53] <nothlit> shwag, fspot might automatically create them if you add the folders to the catalog
[08:53] <Kr0ntab> meener, yes...
[08:53] <Skyrail> If a program isn't responding what so ever and won't close, how do I force quit it?
[08:53] <Kleggas> has anyone managed to get an realtek soundcard to work properly under edgy when installing fglrx drivers, or is it only possible to have the mic and 7.1 sound work if you skip having any 3d rendering?
[08:53] <meener> thanks bruenig \ ubotu
[08:53] <bruenig> Skyrail, killall processname
[08:54] <nothlit> shwag, just MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE you untick the make copy of to folder option before you select any folders
[08:54] <Tominator> hmmm... the reinstallation of the older nvidia-glx doesn't work... i had to uninstall it... are there new beta drivers wich are much more stable than the last ones?

[08:54] <Skyrail> bruenig: do you know the process name for the add remove programs dialogue thing?
[08:54] <nothlit> gnome-app-install
[08:54] <bruenig> Skyrail, or on xubuntu you can just do control alt escape and click on it with the mouse
[08:54] <nothlit> skyrail ^
[08:54] <bruenig> <nothlit> gnome-app-install
[08:54] <Skyrail> nothlit: ok thanks
[08:54] <nothlit> bruenig, ...ehm?
[08:55] <Skyrail> bruenig: I'm on ubuntu, although I wouldn't mind trying out other versions lol
[08:55] <nothlit> Skyrail, fluxbox is great :)
[08:55] <Skyrail> nothlit: fluxbox?
[08:55] <nothlit> Skyrail, alternative window manager, has tabs
[08:56] <glatzor> Skyrail: the process name is python BLABL gnome-app-install
[08:56] <bruenig> no difference between tabs and the desktop switcher, except the desktop switcher doesn't call itself tabs
[08:56] <Skyrail> glatzor: I ended it with just gnome-app-install
[08:56] <noelferreira> jrib: it is taking to much time in paste bin
[08:56] <noelferreira> but i got no debugging symbols found from output jrib
[08:56] <jrib> noelferreira: use http://www.rafb.net/paste/  (see the /topic)
[08:56] <nothlit> Skyrail, not a desktop environment but a window manager, you have to chain things together to get the same functionality if you want things like automounting and desktop icons, things like idesk and gnome-volume-manager and whatnot
[08:57] <jrib> noelferreira: I mean the line about shared libraries, paste that and everything around it
[08:57] <nothlit> Skyrail, but if you're comfortable with the command line you don't need a desktop environment per say
[08:57] <bruenig> Skyrail, gnome-app-install is terrible anyways. I would just uninstall it
[08:57] <glatzor> bruenig: may I ask why?
[08:57] <nothlit> bruenig, theres a big difference in tabs and pagers/desktops for me
[08:58] <Skyrail> bruenig: I find it easier to just find some programs in there when I'm in a hurry or just interested ;)
[08:58] <bruenig> it is so extremely slow
[08:58] <nothlit> i think uninstalling gnome-app-install would break ubuntu-desktop
[08:58] <bruenig> nothlit, it uninstall ubuntu-desktop, doesn't "break" it whatever that means
[08:58] <flitoray> how do i find out my lan IP address?
[08:58] <nothlit> its easier to find programs with apt-cache or aptitude searching
[08:58] <noelferreira> jrib: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/kywJrh65.html
[08:58] <meener> I see in system tools an optional binary X.org driver for nVidia cards - is there something similar I need to my VIA CLE266?
[08:58] <Skyrail> nothlit: I'm fine with using the command line if I know what to do, I use it alot now that I have this PC set up as a mini server
[08:58] <glatzor> bruenig: what do you miss in gnome-app-install?
[08:59] <nothlit> bruenig, but ubuntu-desktop is an important tool for upgrades people shouldn't really uninstall it unless they know what they're doing/remember to re-add it
[08:59] <jrib> noelferreira: I don't see the line about shared libraries that you mentioned, where idd you see it?
[08:59] <Skyrail> nothlit: If I'm looking for a xhtml/css editing application lets say its just quick and easy to try one and uninstall it using that manager as it tells me what it is and what it does lol
[09:00] <glatzor> nothlit: people should use the dist-upgrade tool of Ubuntu, that ensures that ubuntu-desktop will be installed after upgrading
[09:00] <bruenig> glatzor, what do I miss? I don't miss anything from gnome-app-install. apt-cache search is far better.
[09:00] <noelferreira> jrib: if i typq q and then return after that
[09:00] <jrib> noelferreira: k, can you pastebin that as well?
[09:00] <nothlit> glatzor, ahh k
[09:00] <glatzor> bruenig: I just wondered, since you called it a terrible application
[09:00] <noelferreira> ok
[09:00] <bruenig> although once I get the system all setup the times I install anything is so small. Maybe a package a week
[09:00] <bruenig> terrible is relative, in this case relative to apt-cache search
[09:01] <flitoray> Could someone please tell me how to find out my LAN ip address through the terminal?
[09:01] <dsnyders> flitoray, ifconfig
[09:01] <noelferreira> jrib: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/R9dpwj58.html
[09:01] <flitoray> dsnyders: thanks
[09:01] <nothlit> Skyrail, bluefish
[09:02] <flitoray> dsnyders: is it the inet addr, or bcast?
[09:02] <glatzor> nothlit: furthermore we introduced soft dependencies in edgy. so you will soon be able to uninstall parts of ubuntu-desktop dependencies without removing it
[09:02] <Spant[AT] DH> How can I change the page from vertical to horizontal in OpenOffice Writer? I can't find it and I need it now.
[09:02] <jrib> noelferreira: oh I see.  Hmm, not really sure what is going on as we can't get any good info.  When you type 'firefox' normally, does it return you to a new prompt or does it keep the terminal?
[09:02] <dsnyders> flitoray, It should give you both.
[09:02] <noelferreira> keep the terminal jrib
[09:02] <nothlit> glatzor, thats incredibly awesome
[09:02] <flitoray> dsnyders: yah it does, but im trying to set up port forwarding, which one is my local one for the router config
[09:02] <lzap> I have my machine (4x CPU P2) really slow when I boot to smp, in single its speed is okay
[09:03] <edgarin> Helo I have a problem I can't write a disc with NAUTILUS and K3B
[09:03] <nothlit> edgarin, what symptoms do you have/ error messages
[09:03] <glatzor> bruenig: so you are a power user and gnome-app-install doesn't fit your needs. that is ok :)
[09:03] <ryanakca> when creating an initrd.img, according to linux-2.6.19/Documentation/initrd.txt, "copy all the files that are needed to properly use the initrd environment"... and those files are?
[09:04] <dsnyders> flitoray, I'm not exactly understanding your question.  Do you have two lan cards?
[09:04] <jrib> noelferreira: how about  'firefox -safe-mode'?
[09:04] <bruenig> glatzor, perhaps I am not thinking of the brand new user. That is probably really nice for them. I almost forget about that because of how long I have been using
[09:04] <Yukito-kun> Hi!
[09:04] <MiniJames> hi
[09:04] <ArrenLex> !hi
[09:04] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:04] <noelferreira> same situaton jrib
[09:05] <flitoray> dsnyders: I have a wireless card (it is labelled eth1). I just need to find out my local IP address (like 192.168.0.***) because I am trying to set up port forwarding and you need the local ip.
[09:05] <eragon24> what's the best way to jook up a wireless router?
[09:05] <jerp> edgarin, I'd leave Nautilus alone and use K3B
[09:05] <jrib> noelferreira: have you installed anything without using official ubuntu repositories or outside of APT?
=== v|p3r is now known as deny[all] 
[09:05] <edgarin> nothlit with k3b says: Error: Cannot gain SYS_RAWIO capability.Is cdrecord installed SUID root?
[09:05] <edgarin> : Operation not permitted
[09:05] <noelferreira> just jre jrib
[09:05] <agonoruci> how do i find my CD drive in Ubuntu 6.10
[09:06] <nothlit> gnome-app-install helps users keep from getting confused, presents things in an easily understood way so they can install the apps they need without needing to see the clutter of libraries and servers and meta/dummy packages
[09:06] <jrib> noelferreira: did firefox ever work?
[09:06] <nothlit> thats how i see it anyways
[09:06] <noelferreira> but it was ok for a day or two
[09:06] <agonoruci> i put in a Cd and its on Nautilus but i dont know how to get too it in terminal?
[09:06] <noelferreira> yes jrib
[09:06] <meener> Anyone know the drm driver version in edgy 6.10 ?
[09:06] <edgarin> nothlit: the message says: Data does not fit on disk
[09:06] <eragon24> what's the best way to hook up a wireless router?
[09:06] <irnub> anybody can help me with a mkfs.vfat command to format /dev/hda as fat32?
[09:06] <jrib> noelferreira: i don't know, you can try  'sudo apt-get --reinstall install firefox'
[09:06] <noelferreira> again?
[09:06] <Tominator> still got a problem with my nividia-glx... I uninstalled the BETA-Drivers and tried to install the stable from the default repos (i think its mutiverse) and then my XSERVER collapsed saying that the X-Module is another version than the nvidia-glx... whats the problem?
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[09:06] <noelferreira> i did it twice
[09:06] <finalbeta> agonoruci, It will be mounted in /media
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[09:06] <agonoruci> i put in a Cd and its on Nautilus but i dont know how to get too it in terminal?
[09:06] <jrib> noelferreira: no, not if you already have
[09:07] <nothlit> edgarin, have you googled your error message? i haven't had any problems with burning so I can't help you
[09:07] <agonoruci> ok thanks
[09:07] <noelferreira> i can't run thunderbird also jrib
[09:07] <edgarin> :(
[09:07] <Yukito-kun> what about problems during install of 6.10? I get a black screen and could not find anything on the net yet
[09:07] <nothlit> Tominator, yeah like i said, you have to disable nv or nvidia in a linux-restricted-modules configuration file
[09:07] <glatzor> Tominator: the nvidia driver requires a special version of GLX. This library needs to be compiled with your nvdia-driver
[09:08] <nothlit> Tominator, theres some posting or faq somewhere on nvnews that tells you what to do
[09:08] <agonoruci> thx finalbeta
[09:08] <Tominator> ok i'll look for it...
[09:08] <finalbeta> np agonoruci
[09:09] <G3N3SIS> Is garry here?
[09:09] <G3N3SIS> What about Anthony?
[09:10] <G3N3SIS> or trill?
[09:10] <ejm> I have some problems getting my internet going on my folks' desktop.
[09:10] <ryanakca> whats the ubuntu version of red hat's "mkinitrd" ?
[09:10] <agonoruci> i want to take my cd out, but my cd drive is not coming out
[09:10] <G3N3SIS> I used a ethernet cable for the time being ejm
[09:10] <G3N3SIS> Is it in use agon?
[09:10] <ejm> yeah, I wish I could.
[09:10] <agonoruci> umm it might be
[09:10] <agonoruci> how do i stop using it
[09:10] <nolimitsoya> agonoruci, youll have to rightclick the icon and select 'eject'
[09:10] <G3N3SIS> Well, if you have internet why not look it up?
[09:10] <flitoray> dsnyders: ?
[09:10] <nothlit> Tominator, i found it http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=72490 check the bottom
[09:11] <agonoruci> ohh ok
[09:11] <agonoruci> sorry im a Froob
[09:11] <agonoruci> just got this yesterday
[09:11] <ejm> lol if I had a really long ethernet cable, I wouldn't have a problem.
[09:11] <Tominator> thanks ;)
[09:11] <agonoruci> it OWNZ though
[09:11] <nothlit> Tominator, i hope it works, thats how i fixed it on a test system
[09:11] <ejm> Anyway, how would I get rid of the broadcom module that I don't need?
[09:12] <kbrooks> agonoruci: this is something called unmounting - telling ubuntu that yoou are not using your CD anymore and want it out
[09:12] <ejm> I'm going to try ndiswrapping a buffalo driver here in a sec. And it'd help if my darn lexmark printer would print the web pages correct.y
[09:12] <agonoruci> thanks kbrooks and everyone else, i am removing windowz tottally
[09:12] <eragon24> what's the best way to hook up a wireless router?
[09:12] <kbrooks> agonoruci: on Windows, you don'y have to explicitly "unmount" your CD
[09:13] <agonoruci> windowz crashes 2 much for me
[09:13] <agonoruci> this thing boots up in about 20 sec
[09:13] <agonoruci> and shuts down in abotu 10 sec
[09:13] <agonoruci> and havent had a crash yet
[09:13] <agonoruci> run very smoothly
[09:13] <tmitchell> i've got a printer set up and working mostly, except when .gif's print, they're just a solid black box
[09:13] <finalbeta> Yukito-kun, it seems to be a problem with the Edgy release. But I figured it only happened with upgrades from Dapper. I believe it was the graphics card driver that was not found. You have to download them manually and reconfigure xorg. Not 100% sure though.
[09:14] <finalbeta> Yukito-kun, tryed booting with live CD, chrooting and updating?

[09:15] <agonoruci> LONG LIVE UBUNTU
[09:15] <ryanakca> whats the ubuntu version of red hat's "mkinitrd" ?
[09:15] <eragon24> what's the best way to set up wireless Internet?
[09:15] <jerp> "French parliament dumping Windows for Linux"  ...  http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6138372.html
[09:15] <ejm> depends on what you have.
[09:16] <plesnivyjano> helloo, is it possible to browse internet in my work "via" my home machine? What is needed to do so?
[09:16] <kbrooks> I think I'll run Windows under Ubuntu. How do I do that?
[09:16] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: SSH forwarding...
[09:16] <dsnyders> kbrooks, take a look at wine and vmware
[09:16] <compengi> i have ext3 extended partition which is set to root permission how can i change it to user permission in order to be able to write on it?
[09:16] <ryanakca> how do you create an initrd.img?
[09:17] <finalbeta> Yukito-kun, Seems like this https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/67487
[09:17] <kbrooks> dsnyders: I don't want to use wine, so vmware it is then
[09:17] <plesnivyjano> kbrooks thats all? do i need some proxy server running on my home machine too?
[09:17] <flitoray> dsnyders: I asked how to find out my lan ip to set up port forwarding. (like 192.168.0.***)
[09:18] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: actually i think a proxy server is better, wiith ssh forwarding
[09:18] <finalbeta> compengi, you can set permissions with sudo chmod and change the permissions for others. So something like sudo chmod o+w. Or just change the owner of the files to yourself. sudo chown <user> path
[09:18] <plesnivyjano> kbrooks why so?
[09:19] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: well, maybe you don't need ssh forwarding at all
[09:19] <dsnyders> flitoray, what happend with ifconfig?
[09:19] <Raskall> Hirvinen: thanks for the chroot-tips. Works great now. I even set my preferred browser to "dchroot -d firefox %s", so that I use the 32bit firefox when clicking links too.
[09:19] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: just try out the proxy server
[09:19] <EequalsMC2> hello
[09:19] <flitoray> dsnyders: it gives me the inet addr and bcast address, i dont know which one to use
=== lunchbox is now known as Konnektion
[09:20] <plesnivyjano> kbrooks thanx ill take a look on whole proxy thing
[09:20] <compengi> finalbeta:  if i will do sudo chmode o+w i would be able later to do what ever i want in the partition?
[09:20] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: in firefox, u can config a proxy server. lemme see how
[09:20] <jamesb_> is this the right place to ask about sound problems in kubuntu edgy?
[09:20] <dsnyders> flitoray, to forward a port you would need to know the specific address you are forwarding it to, so the inet address is the one to use.
[09:21] <EequalsMC2> what is the best way to update dapper
[09:21] <drkm> i'm considering changing over to ubuntu, but there are a few apps i want to run but only run on windows.. is there any type of emulater i can use on ubuntu so that i can run these in linux?
[09:21] <flitoray> dsnyders: thanks
[09:21] <finalbeta> compengi, "man chmod" You really want to read this if you use linux. Setting rights is a very common task. And no o+w mean other users then the owner have write rights.
[09:22] <EequalsMC2> what is the best way to update dapper
[09:22] <finalbeta> !upgrade
[09:22] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[09:22] <nothlit> Tominator, I have the nvidia amaranth package if you need it
[09:22] <Amaranth> !amaranth
[09:22] <ubotu> For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[09:23] <nothlit> dkrm you can run wine but don't expect it to just work for most applications, or you can emulate windows inside qemu/kqemu and vmware player/workstation
[09:23] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: ffox menu > edit > preferences > connection settings > select manual proxy configuration
[09:23] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: for 1.5
[09:23] <noelferreira> fiirefox won't run on edgy. anyone knows why?
[09:24] <nolimitsoya> quick question: is it possible to add drives to a raid5 lvm array in a simple fashion? (without having to lift all data of the array, and reinsert it)
[09:24] <kbrooks> plesnivyjano: for 2.0 in edgy, its tools > options to access preferences
[09:24] <jamesb_> noelferreira: runs for meg, have you deleted any lock files?
[09:24] <jamesb_> -g
[09:24] <noelferreira> i don't know jamesb_
[09:24] <noelferreira> how can i see it jamesb_?
[09:25] <Yukito-kun> finalbeta Yes, it's just like on the link you posted
[09:25] <compengi> finalbeta: thanks alot it had worked
[09:25] <freemanda> hello
[09:25] <noelferreira> jrib: are you there?
[09:25] <jrib> noelferreira: yep
[09:25] <nothlit> Amaranth, oh theres a new repo? ty
[09:25] <plesnivyjano> kbrooks so then i set my remote proxy and tunnel through ssh to my local proxy server at home
[09:25] <noelferreira> i guess that firefox is running fine but doesn't appear graphically
[09:26] <Amaranth> nothlit: Yeah, new host. Had bandwidth problems.
[09:26] <noelferreira> is that possible jrib?
[09:26] <Yukito-kun> finalbeta I haven't installed Edgy yet, because of the problem, do you think I should get Dapper instead and forget about it?
[09:26] <finalbeta> Yukito-kun, Well, i'm really not sure on how to fix it, perhaps some of the launchpad replies can help. else I would try chrooting, updating and reconfiguring xorg.
[09:26] <jamesb_> noelferreira: probably in your .mozilla directory. Have you tried starting firefox from the command line and seeing if it gives any error messages?
[09:26] <shwag> Yukito-kun: whats the problem with Edgy ?
[09:26] <compengi> finalbeta: do you know how to install an nvidia driver for edgy i have fx 5500
[09:26] <finalbeta> Yukito-kun, if you hate bugs, yes, stay with dapper. Edgy has it's share of problems.
[09:26] <G3N3SIS> Hey all, I have finally gotten Ubuntu to work, though it is Dapper atm.  Edgy wouldn't budge.  Though, it is saying that it isn't picking up any sound devices.  Is there a problem with it?
[09:26] <jrib> noelferreira: well I guess so.  What made you think that?  (I had thought that may have been the problem but wasn't sure how to test it).  Are you running any fancy beryl or compiz stuff maybe?
[09:27] <noelferreira> no
[09:27] <finalbeta> Yukito-kun, edgy is not much more then and updated dapper with bugs. due to the short release cycle, dapper is still a fine release.
[09:27] <noelferreira> not now jrib

[09:34] <finalbeta> Yukito-kun, I see no reason why you wouldn't get the black screen on Xubuntu. So yes, I would try Dapper
[09:34] <markus__> dsnyders, the oppsite.. eg delete the entry "input to put in" in the file "thefile.txt"
[09:34] <Ernz> CANCEL THAT: It looks like KTorrent does it. Thanks anyway,. Bye
[09:34] <Kupolinkn> speak spanish ?
[09:34] <nothlit> markus__, opposite? i'm not sure what you mean but it you want to do that with ubuntus sudo system you do echo string | sudo tee -a file
[09:34] <leafw> where is the data contained in the gconf-editor stored in the file system?
[09:34] <finalbeta> needshelp, you can't open the partition from the places menu? Did it ever work? Normally windows partitions get added to /etc/fstab and show up in places. But you can't write on ntfs partitions, only read from them.

[09:35] <leafw> they are all ftp

[09:36] <nothlit> hou5ton, nautilus already has samba support built in, but smbfs is a nice solution for mounting samba shared
[09:36] <jrib> leafw: hmm can you right click in nautilus and select "unmount"?

[09:37] <leafw> jrib : in the gconf-editor for instance, under desktop/connected_servers
[09:37] <Elda> rverrips:  I tried that, but still no dice :S
[09:37] <needshelp> rverrips: says dev/hda2 does not exist
[09:37] <finalbeta> needshelp, ubuntu should support sata. You are running the live CD? Or you have a full installation?

[09:38] <noex> Anyone have tips for creating a new partition from a existing Ubuntu setup? Currently, I have all my space allocated for, I will need to do some resizing. Anyone has a FAQ link or suggestion for me?
[09:38] <nothlit> Yukito-kun, Xubuntu is just a lighter weight desktop that uses a lighter weight suite of apps, you still get automounting ( i think) and filebrowsing and what not, but it runs faster and less feature filled. you can still reinstall any apps you might miss and you can check what ubuntu installs by typing apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop
[09:38] <finalbeta> needshelp, ah, that explains it. On the Live DVD, no partitions are mounted by default. you will have to mount them yourself.
[09:38] <Yukito-kun> finalbeta Of course, you can configure it afterwards. But it costs time! Again, thanks for your kind help! It's my decision after all.
[09:38] <needshelp> so how do i do it finalbeta

[09:40] <finalbeta> needshelp, sudo mkdir /media/windows and then sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows/ -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222 needshelp you will have to replace /dev/hda1 with the windows partition.

[09:51] <r3tex> G3N3SIS, RTFM means Read The Frrrrriggin Manual :)
[09:51] <G3N3SIS> Well, when I went thru the thread in the forums
[09:51] <r3tex> it was a joke
[09:51] <stewski> do you people know about free legal torrent movies?
[09:51] <Roy> i got a problem with my cd rom copier
[09:52] <G3N3SIS> it claimed there was no sound card
[09:52] <G3N3SIS> then i did a lspci -l
[09:52] <eilker> stewski: mine is vmwareserver
[09:52] <G3N3SIS> and it listed that it saw my multimedia device
[09:52] <nothlit> cleo, im working in an unpacked chrooted env which has no grub
[09:52] <Roy> it doesnt want to burn nothing data, audio, iso etc nothing
[09:52] <stewski> http://www.publicdomaintorrents.com/index.html
[09:52] <r3tex> G3N3SIS, do cat /proc/asound/cards
[09:52] <mianos> which tool handles the multimedia-keys in edgy? i have a logitech keyboard with such keys - they're working fine - BUT: i have an Hauppauge TV-Card with infrared-remote too
[09:52] <Roy> what can i do? or what im doing wrong?
[09:52] <G3N3SIS> one sec
[09:52] <stewski> some good films out of copyright I believe
[09:52] <G3N3SIS> [V8237          ] : VIA8237 - VIA 8237
[09:52] <G3N3SIS>                      VIA 8237 with AD1980 at 0xc800, irq 193
[09:53] <r3tex> there it is
[09:53] <swaby1> roy are u using k3b
[09:53] <mianos> two days ago i updatet to edgy and now the remote is set on multimedia-keys too - i don't want that!
[09:53] <r3tex> so it's detected
[09:53] <stewski> eilker sorry I cant be more help I don't remember, mine is vmware server and had no problem installing the tools
[09:53] <Roy> yeas swaby1
[09:53] <eilker> stewski: ok, now i could install it, thank you
[09:53] <G3N3SIS> but the sound thing says either something is wrong with my card, or i'm missing gstreamer plugins
[09:53] <Roy> i got ubuntu edgy gnome keb
[09:53] <nothlit> Amaranth, is it hawkwind's or philips key that you need for the contrib repo of seer of souls
[09:53] <G3N3SIS> so should I go get gstreamer?
[09:53] <swaby1> do you get error messages?
[09:53] <compengi> who knows how to install nvidia driver for fx 5500 on edgy?
[09:53] <mianos> somebody an idea how i can fix this,? just the keyboard should be used for volume-control and such things
[09:53] <Amaranth> nothlit: hawkwind's
[09:53] <PingunZ> What font does ubuntu use ? ( system > preferences > fonts )
[09:53] <mianos> not the lirc-compatible-tv-card-remote
[09:54] <Roy> it say someting about an error code 255
[09:54] <gionnyboss> Hi all! I have a weird problem..
[09:54] <nothlit> Amaranth, Thanks :)
[09:54] <Amaranth> nothlit: Have you, by any chance, read an Animorphs book? :)
[09:54] <strabes> Amaranth: I have!!! i read them all like 10 years ago
[09:54] <nothlit> Amaranth, indeed
[09:54] <Amaranth> strabes: me too :P
[09:54] <jerp> PingunZ, I think they are defaulted to serif
[09:54] <Amaranth> I've still got a large box full of them
[09:54] <eilker> stewski: lets say i had virus in win xp part, my host os will be effected ??
[09:54] <Elda> meh
[09:55] <dou213> eilker, no
[09:55] <Roy> and it tell me a report at the end but it long and i dont know what iis it
[09:55] <Elda> Im sure I missed it if someone answered me as xchat started acting gimpy
[09:55] <gionnyboss> I installed a patch (915resolution) to use the correct screen resolution with my laptop. If I start in safe mode, enter root password and start the patch manually (/etc/init.d/915resolution start) and then I do 'startx' it works... while if I start the system normally, I can't use the correct resolution, now I'm at 640x480 and it's awful... can anybody help, please? maybe I have to be sure that it is in the runlevel, but I don't know
[09:55] <gionnyboss> how to do it
[09:55] <Elda> But how would I get to the settings where I can select my video card etc?
[09:55] <stewski> eilker the virtual server is safe, the ubuntu install will remain fine regardless of XP
[09:55] <dou213> eilker, the virtual machine protects the host machine, it's one of the great benefits
[09:55] <eilker> dou213: it is good, i liked it too much:)) except of one thing
[09:56] <Amaranth> Elda: Looking at that thread now
[09:56] <mianos> no idea?
[09:56] <Elda> okey
[09:56] <nothlit> gionnyboss, you have to edit gdm's configuration files
[09:56] <Roy> i want to burn the kubuntu image but it doent work
[09:56] <Elda> I cant get any of the kerlenl things to install
[09:56] <G3N3SIS> what is the original root password?
[09:56] <eilker> the mui doesnt accept my username and password
[09:56] <Roy> my cd copier
[09:56] <G3N3SIS> I did su in the terminal and I tried nothing, as well as root.
[09:56] <G3N3SIS> Nothing came out
[09:56] <strabes> G3N3SIS: you have to set it yourself
[09:56] <Elda> So I tried without it, and it gives me an error.log
[09:56] <jerp> PingunZ, I'm sure you know Ubuntu allows a package called msttcorefonts also
[09:56] <stewski> there are plenty of difficulties running linux but the lack of viruses and not needing a firewall are brilliant benefits
[09:56] <compengi> Roy: try to burn it on low speed like 4x
[09:56] <Elda> So then I tried what it mentoined on page 3 but I dont know where I access that
[09:56] <PingunZ> jerp, indeed .. I know :)
[09:57] <Amaranth> Elda: I would not recommend doing that.
[09:57] <Elda> :s
[09:57] <nothlit> Does anyone know how the boot menu of the livecd works?
[09:57] <stewski> I've heard it said that when you have a small gene pool you get ugly and ill a lot :-)
[09:57] <eilker> dou213 , stewski : the mui doesnt accept my username and password, do u have such experience ?
[09:57] <nothlit> stewski, you probably still need to run a firewall
[09:57] <eumel> hi
[09:57] <Elda> I dont need to do all that, I have an igp 345m and Im thinking all I have to do is : For those testing or already working with Ubuntu 6.10 there is a twist to this. You no longer need to load the DRI's driver as it's already in the distro. Just go into System Settings/Monitor & Display, log into the administrator mode and set your hardware to:
[09:57] <Elda> that part
[09:58] <stewski> nothlit ubuntu runs no listening services by default
[09:58] <gionnyboss> nothlit, sorry for the private, I ask you here! how can I edit gdm's startup files, please?
[09:58] <Roy> i cant burn my cd's
[09:58] <Elda> But I cant find the system settings part :/
[09:58] <compengi> Roy: O.o why?!
[09:58] <eumel> am new to ubuntu,how do i mount my hda5 partition and set my keyboard to de
[09:58] <nothlit> stewski, of course but people may still enable services like networks shares and ssh and if so...
[09:59] <Roy> it appears an error code 255
[09:59] <stewski> well ssh is pretty secure no?
[09:59] <nothlit> Doesn't mean I would leave it at defaults
[09:59] <shogo3d> check this out..  ps -ef|grep X tells me that Xgl is running
[09:59] <alecjw> when i open my address book in evolution, it goes to Local/Anniversery, how can i make it go to Local/All instead?
[09:59] <needshelp> okay: so i got my second partitoin to mount i can see those files, but have many more on the actual first one with windows: used sda2 for that. but it keeps telling my the first one is already monted in tmp/disks-conf-sda1 any ideas
[09:59] <shogo3d> but its still 2d
[09:59] <Lamego> ssh is secure as long you setup secure passwords :P
[09:59] <stewski> and the presumption is you're behind a nat-firewall in most cases
[09:59] <nothlit> most people don't use keys and leave it at a default port
[09:59] <nothlit> great for brute forcing
[09:59] <shogo3d> what am i missing?
[10:00] <dou213> stewski, you seem to have some exp with virtual machines, can we prv?
[10:00] <eilker> stewski: https://127.0.0.1:8333 it doesnt accept my username and password, did u have it before ?
[10:00] <eumel> ok,set my keyboard,but how do i mount my hd
[10:00] <oosoosh> oh my God.
[10:00] <oosoosh> this channel is full
[10:00] <stewski> sure whats up?
[10:00] <alecjw> oosoosh: 1002 is nothing
[10:00] <oosoosh> stewski: i think it is good
[10:00] <oosoosh> alecjw: really ? where can i see more ?
[10:01] <cleo> if I had a second dvd drive ... would edgy burn dvd by copying on the fly through the native cd/dvd burner program?
[10:01] <sigp239> I get an error when I login:  Internal error
[10:01] <sigp239> failed to initialize HAL!
[10:01] <sigp239> does anyone know what that is/
[10:01] <alecjw> oosoosh: well, this channel has more users than any other channel on freenode, but there are often more people here
[10:01] <Elda> Amarinth - I know that other part shouldnt be done but on the third page it mentions just entering System Settings/Monitor & Display and setting it to use the video card... how would I enter that?
[10:01] <Elda> As I cant seem to find it :S
[10:02] <eumel> jeez,so many ppl in here and no help :(
[10:02] <nothlit> cleo, nautilus burning isn't powerful enough for that, if you're running ubuntu and not kubuntu, try install gnomebaker or braseros and see how you like them
[10:02] <G3N3SIS> What is the default super user password
[10:02] <oosoosh> alecjw: i see. really good
[10:02] <Elda> eumel, be patient :s
[10:02] <Elda> Not everyone here is an expert and there are many other people in here who need hep too
[10:02] <oosoosh> eumel: whats up ?
[10:02] <Elda> *help
[10:02] <alecjw> eumel: it should mount automatically
[10:03] <nothlit> G3N3SIS, there is none, ubuntu uses sudo, you can use sudo -s for super user privileges but old varibles and sudo -i for true root login, i recommend you use these because then sudo logs them
[10:03] <eilker> people in vmware ;  https://127.0.0.1:8333 it doesnt accept my username and password, anyone had it before ?

[10:03] <stewski> very helpful
[10:03] <cleo> nothlit, but would they do the job? cant afford a new dvd drive to experiment backing up my documentary?
[10:03] <G3N3SIS> yeah, i messed up on log in
[10:04] <justin420> hi. anybody tell me how to disable agpgart?
[10:04] <eloquence_> ircminer, who here prefers kubuntu over ubuntu?
[10:04] <G3N3SIS> thanks I got it
[10:04] <G3N3SIS> I have to log off really fast
[10:04] <eloquence_> huh
[10:04] <stewski> i prefer ubuntu but Ive not tried kbuntu
[10:04] <cleo> even k3b would do if its known to copy and burn on the fly as k3b installs on ubuntu anyway...
[10:04] <nothlit> cleo, you could probably use one of them and make the iso and then use the same drive to burn the duplicate
[10:05] <nothlit> cleo i see no reason why you would need another drive
[10:05] <nothlit> cleo and if both those progs don't have what you need k3b will
[10:05] <alecjw> when i open my address book in evolution, it goes to Local/Anniversery, how can i make it go to Local/All instead?
[10:05] <eumel> oosoosh: i'm trying to find out,how i can mount and use my hda5 from live-cd?
[10:05] <oosoosh> who asked the question about failing to initialize HAL ?
[10:05] <stewski> I'd try kde but the k prefix on apps seems counter intuitive and for a while kde was using some not free libraries (not any more though) Ive used amarok kde music player it was excellent
[10:05] <cleo> nothlit, so i do not have to sacrifice hard disk space ... why on the fly burning is good
[10:06] <oosoosh> eumel: it isnt automatically mounted ?
[10:06] <nothlit> ubuntu is really impressive in how theyve implemented gnome, it convinced me, i don't use a DE but still
[10:06] <stewski> and k3b burner looks great
[10:06] <alecjw> eumel: sudo mount -t <filke system> /dev/hda5 <mount point>
[10:06] <oosoosh> for failing HAL initialization http://easylinuxguide.com/forum/index.php?topic=68.msg233
[10:06] <cleo> nothlit, also speed .. half the time ...no?
[10:06] <nothlit> cleo, ahh, well if you don't mind the extra expense it should be possible, you can google it if you want to be absolutely sure or poke around in the applications
[10:06] <eumel> alecjw:but where do i find the mounted hd?in kanotix it is under media or other distros under mnt?!
[10:06] <stewski> nothlit yes I really like ubuntu environment the missus uses it without caring its not windows
[10:06] <oosoosh> this channel is fast -
[10:06] <r3tex> is the default ubuntu kernel not smp enabled?? :P
[10:07] <alecjw> eumel: what fs is it, and i can give you an exact command
[10:07] <leafw> r3tex : nope. Just choose the smp from synaptic
[10:07] <eobanb> !smp
[10:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:07] <bimberi> r3tex: it is in Edgy, but not in earlier Ubuntu releases
[10:07] <nothlit> cleo, anyways you don't sacrifice space you can delete it afterwards. also burning programs still cache the data before they start to prevent corruption
[10:07] <eobanb> !kernel
[10:07] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[10:07] <eobanb> durr.
[10:07] <r3tex> bimberi, wtf did i get an old version =/ shiat
[10:07] <oosoosh> eumel: THAT disk u talk about , what is the file system ?
[10:07] <bimberi> !version | r3tex
[10:07] <ubotu> r3tex: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[10:08] <sigp239> what does this do?  sudo update-rc.d -f dbus remove
[10:08] <sigp239> sudo update-rc.d dbus defaults 12
[10:08] <n1gke> Howdy folks. . .
[10:08] <eobanb> bimberi, that's not true.
[10:08] <r3tex> 6.10
[10:08] <eumel> oosoosh: what you mean by filesystem?
[10:08] <stewski> one thing about gnome - file listing in the home directory (when showing dot directories) is dog slow
[10:08] <leafw> !uname
[10:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uname - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:08] <bimberi> eobanb: oh, tell me more
[10:08] <eobanb> bimberi, by default the kernel is -generic
[10:08] <leafw> lsb_release -a ? Shouldn't that be uname -a ?
[10:08] <r3tex> bimberi, edgy.. it's hard to remember the names :D hehe
[10:08] <bimberi> !generic | eobanb
[10:08] <ubotu> eobanb: Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[10:08] <eobanb> smp is available, as an option, in all versions of ubuntu
[10:08] <oosoosh> eumel: tell us if you have installed anything on it
[10:08] <nothlit> who has enabled popularity-contest here, just curious ^^
[10:08] <sigp239> oosoosh:  what do those commands do?
[10:08] <justin420> Anybody have a nvidia card; and if so uses the nvagp instead of agpgart? if so could you help with disabling agpgart so the nvagp mod can do its thing?
[10:08] <jrib> nothlit: <--
[10:09] <bimberi> nothlit: aye
[10:09] <eumel> my hda5 is fat32 and the other one is reiserfs,if thats what youmean
[10:09] <stewski> whats popularity?
[10:09] <oosoosh> sigp239: i dont know - but i thought it could help
[10:09] <nothlit> Isn't popularity-contest's results skewed towards power users? =/
[10:09] <hou5ton> how do I get smb4k to let me open it as user?
[10:09] <Elda> how do I log in with root access?
[10:09] <nothlit> stewski, it keeps track of what programs you use more often and tells ubuntu
[10:09] <n1gke> !nvidia
[10:09] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:09] <jerp> mopth, I think I have it activated
[10:09] <stewski> where do I do that
[10:09] <M3G4crux>  hi
[10:10] <M3G4crux> I am having problems connecting bluetooth
[10:10] <stewski> seems like a genius idea
[10:10] <nothlit> stewski, dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest
[10:10] <jerp> nothlit, I think I have it activated
[10:10] <bart__> i can't resize windows in beryl :(
[10:10] <M3G4crux> l2ping tells me "Permission denied" anyone has any idea how to fix this?
[10:10] <nothlit> jerp, :)
[10:10] <oosoosh> Elda: have u enabled root already ?
[10:10] <alecjw> eumel: mkdir HardDriveA5, then sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda5 HardDiskA5, then it will be in your home dir
[10:11] <stewski> cheers nothlit I think I can help using this
[10:11] <Elda> Im thinking its enabled, but when I tried logging in as root it tells me "cannot login as root from this screen" or something like that
[10:11] <Elda> When I try to do so >.<
[10:11] <eumel> alecjw: thx
[10:11] <justin420> n1gke: dont see anything there about using nvagp instead of agpgart??
[10:11] <nothlit> stewski, thats great :D
[10:11] <Elda> On the front screen where I log in/select session etc
[10:11] <oosoosh> Elda: what screen ? can u be more specific ?
[10:11] <Elda> You know, the screen where you select your session when you first start ubuntu
[10:12] <Elda> Where you enter your user name and password
[10:12] <oosoosh> Elda: aaah i see
[10:12] <Elda> so how do I access it?
[10:12] <Elda> As I wish to change a system setting so that it actually uses the drivers to my card....
[10:12] <oosoosh> Elda: can u see the picture oor name for root there ?
[10:12] <jrib> !root | Elda
[10:12] <ubotu> Elda: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:12] <Elda> bleh then how do I access this? Setting
[10:13] <stewski> nothlit thats why I love ubuntu when they want to spy on us they make us use dpkg to CHOOSE to let them
[10:13] <stewski> :-)
[10:13] <eumel> cool,i can see my files now ;)
[10:13] <Elda> one seccond
[10:13] <whyameye> I can't get sendmail to actually send mail successfully. Anybody know anything about either config or substitution of that program with another?
[10:13] <nothlit> stewski, :)
[10:13] <Elda> jrib how would I get to the point that I can do this?  For those testing or already working with Ubuntu 6.10 there is a twist to this. You no longer need to load the DRI's driver as it's already in the distro. Just go into System Settings/Monitor & Display, log into the administrator mode and set your hardware to:
[10:13] <Elda> Because I look at the system drop down and see nothing that allows me to access that
[10:14] <rc-1> OMG LOL http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html read number eight
[10:14] <Elda> Im assuming I have to be in root to do so >.<
[10:14] <nothlit> stewski, its not spying though, the majority windows programs out there do that, its just anonymous statistics reporting
[10:14] <bimberi> Elda: It is better to use sudo and gksudo for temporary superuser access rather than enabling root login.  However if you must: System -> Administration -> Login Window, Security Tab, Allow Local Administrator Login
[10:14] <toM|vendettA> Hi, can someone tell me how I can get the login screen for Ubuntu to show the users available, so I dont have to type in my account name, i can just click on my account and type in the password?
[10:14] <Elda> Okey
[10:15] <stewski> I was kiddin nothlit and my eyes have been open on widows software for a while
[10:15] <nothlit> bimberi, i would feel safer with su -c then sudo myself, different password and permissions don't hang around for 15 minutes
[10:15] <eumel> how much RAM is required to run ubuntu from hd?
[10:15] <stewski> oops typo :-)
[10:15] <dsnyders> toM|vendettA, you mean, like a dropdown list of users?
[10:15] <Elda> hmmm
[10:15] <Elda> Okey then Im wondering through sudo, how would I get to that option?
[10:15] <jrib> Elda: what web page are you reading?
[10:16] <nothlit> eumel, i wouldn't use less than 256 for sure, there is xubuntu and ubuntu-lite if you're running legacy hardware
[10:16] <Elda> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=221672&page=3&highlight=7000VE Page 3 post 23
[10:16] <toM|vendettA> dsnyders, like the windows xp login menu ( i just replaced xp with ubuntu, and my mom doesnt know how to logon, trying to make it as simple as possible for her )
[10:16] <bimberi> nothlit: kk
[10:16] <oosoosh> toM|vendettA: Desktop ---> Administration ----> Login Window ---> User Tab
[10:16] <G3N3SIS> I probably, have the biggest puzzler yet!  I messed up on my install.  I made the administrator user named "root" and I can't login on that.  It is considered to be a root user.  Should I go back and reinstall.. or is there a way for my current user to become an admin.  I made this user thru failsafe recovery mode.
[10:17] <nothlit> G3N3SIS, the root account already existed
[10:17] <toM|vendettA> thanks oosoosh  and dsnyders
[10:17] <eumel> well,i'm on 256,but i.e kanotix is for 192mb,but with some applications thats rather slow
[10:17] <jrib> G3N3SIS: add your user to the 'admin' group
[10:17] <nothlit> G3N3SIS, if you're absolutely completely sure you want su - then you can use sudo passwd
[10:17] <oosoosh> toM|vendettA: ALWAYS
[10:17] <G3N3SIS> no, it's not that.
[10:17] <G3N3SIS> I want to use sudo
[10:18] <G3N3SIS> but, I can't.  It seems to think I don't have admin privs
[10:18] <jrib> G3N3SIS: in recovery mode:  adduser your_user_name admin
[10:18] <jerp> eumel, there is the alternative that will use as little 192 megs of memory
[10:18] <G3N3SIS> k thanks
[10:18] <oosoosh> G3N3SIS: if i understand well, you have the super user ( root ) and another user called root as well ?
[10:18] <eumel> whats the difrence between ubuntu and ubuntu-lite?
[10:19] <nothlit> G3N3SIS, you can make any use admin through a gui as well if you use system administration users and groups edit a user and choose the last tab
[10:19] <G3N3SIS> haha yeah
[10:19] <G3N3SIS> i'm retarded
[10:19] <stewski> nothlit what firewall are you using?
[10:19] <G3N3SIS> Yeah, that can be all true noth, but I can't do that if I'm not an admin
[10:19] <jrib> G3N3SIS: actually I would file that as a bug.  The installer should check for that
[10:20] <nothlit> stewski, my router is my firewall i play with services quite often I've set up the firewall before but I don't really need it
[10:20] <G3N3SIS> haha, as soon as I fix these stupid errors I will.

[10:20] <stewski> hardware firewall > software so good idea
[10:20] <eumel> oosoosh: thx
[10:20] <Elda> Trying to figure out how to bring up that so I can change that
[10:20] <oosoosh> eumel: always
[10:20] <nothlit> stewski, if you need a gtk app and don't like firestarter, you can user fireflier-server and fireflier-client-gtk but you may need to edit a config file in /etc to login to it, and root users cant btw
[10:21] <Elda> I want to get into the system settings
[10:21] <stewski> are they based on iptables?
[10:22] <hobby55> I want to do the following command "wget http://url/xmule-1.13.6.x86.package
[10:22] <hobby55> "
[10:22] <aleka> I need help with Virtual partition recovery or physical recovery
[10:22] <nothlit> G3N3SIS the first user account should have admin privileges already
[10:22] <nothlit> stewski, yes all iptables/netfilter based
[10:22] <hobby55> and I get the following error messages "Herleiden van url... mislukt: Name or service not known.

[10:23] <nothlit> stewski, also don't bother with gnome-lokkit it's practically useless
[10:23] <bimberi> Elda: I think this menu option you're looking for is in the driconf program (but I'm guessing)
[10:23] <Elda> driconf
[10:23] <Elda> How do I access that?
[10:23] <nothlit> stewski, if you don't mind qt/kdelibs theres guard dog      and fwbuilder

[10:35] <porkpie> hey guys what package would I use for this DBI-1.20  it's to allow spamassassin to talk to a mysql db
[10:35] <nothlit> sioux, if you don't like the repo's you can use subversion (svn) and compile it yourself straight from the dev sources
[10:35] <BetaCookies> Elda: yes, 6.10 is edgy
[10:35] <MrKeuner> dsnyders: thanks anyways

[10:35] <matthew_> I won't use it
[10:35] <frantic> so umm how do i roll back to flash 7
[10:36] <sioux> sudo apt-get upgrade is much easyer!
[10:36] <jrib> frantic: what repository?
[10:36] <nothlit> kr0n1x, please follow my instructions, gtk and murrine are not things to be activated, there are things to be used and gtk already is, and when you use a murrine theme the murrine engine will be too.

[11:03] <G3N3SIS> My volume control is not functioning
[11:03] <kbrooks> I*
[11:03] <compengi> gnomefreak, i didn't get you
[11:03] <G3N3SIS> It says i'm either missing Gstreamer plugins which I just installed, or my device isn't supported
[11:03] <frantic> that is indeed strange
[11:03] <strabes> G3N3SIS: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Comprehensive_Sound_Problems_Solutions_Guide
[11:04] <gnomefreak> compengi: look in your xorg.conf file and tell me if it has &quot;nvidiaquot&  or if it shows up normal
[11:04] <G3N3SIS> But wait, there is more.
[11:04] <compengi> gnomefreak, what's that sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:04] <compengi> ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:862:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave but xorg.conf opens :S
[11:04] <G3N3SIS> I did multiple methods of what people have told me to do
[11:04] <frantic> I found that setting up /etc/asound right fixed everything that has ever gone wrong with sound on my computer
[11:04] <gnomefreak> compengi: yes
[11:04] <cleo> how to change default application for bittorent to be the default program in edgy? democracy has taken over and is messing up
[11:04] <gnomefreak> compengi: ignore that for now
[11:04] <gradin> i've got a problem...
[11:04] <G3N3SIS> including the cat method, lspci -v both say they recognize my stuff.
[11:04] <G3N3SIS> how would i do that frantic?
[11:04] <princemackenzie> gradin what is it
[11:05] <gradin> my fail2ban script keeps telling me that the same ip address has been banned...
[11:05] <G3N3SIS> strabes, i've tried your link, it doesn't work
[11:05] <compengi> gnomefreak, &quot;nvidiaquot& isn't present in the xorg.conf file
[11:05] <gnomefreak> good
[11:05] <feety> hi there. i just need to know what to add to fstab to make my hard disk /dev/hda1 writable by myself instead of just root. thanks :-)
[11:05] <princemackenzie> gradin, im not the one to ask, haha
[11:05] <gradin> so the script runs but doen't ban the ip using iptables
[11:05] <gnomefreak> compengi: wher eit says driver what do you see?
[11:05] <toM|vendettA> hi
[11:05] <strabes> G3N3SIS: it does; i'm browsing the page right now
[11:05] <princemackenzie> feety what is the file system
[11:05] <russiansonya> Is there an easy way to switch between english and russian keyboard settings?
[11:05] <feety> ext3
[11:05] <compengi> gnomefreak, nvidia
[11:05] <G3N3SIS> no no, not that type of doesn't work
[11:05] <feety> princemackenzie: ext3 (repeated for highlights)
[11:05] <toM|vendettA> can someone tell me how to get the list of people in the channel on the right side of xchat? I just installed it and its not there =\
[11:05] <strabes> kbrooks: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Video
[11:05] <G3N3SIS> doesn't work as in, i've already used the source same one as on the forums and it didn't help me
[11:06] <G3N3SIS> i'll try once again if you insist though, i'll give it a go and get back to you all
[11:06] <gnomefreak> compengi: the bus id
[11:06] <strabes> G3N3SIS: what exactly is your problem?
[11:06] <gradin> anybody know anything about fail2ban or iptables?
[11:06] <feety> toM|vendettA: you installed the normal xchat right, not the xchat-gnome package
[11:06] <compengi> gnomefreak, PCI:1:00.0
[11:06] <princemackenzie> feety, make a backup of fstab, and then just copy the entry from your root directory and change the mount point
[11:06] <toM|vendettA> i dont know feety, im not sure, i just downloaded it and installed it and now its not there
[11:06] <G3N3SIS> Well, I hear the tribal beat on logout and boot up.
[11:06] <gnomefreak> compengi: the bus id should read BusID PCI:1:00:0
[11:06] <G3N3SIS> Just to get that across.
[11:07] <G3N3SIS> That means that it is my module they said, not my card.
[11:07] <frantic> Sorry, pastebin is taking forever
[11:07] <feety> toM|vendettA: you installed the version from the repositories right
[11:07] <gnomefreak> compengi: save it and restart X
[11:07] <ompaul> gradin, you have to be more specific, some people can tell you some things others can tell you other things but no question means noone knows what you need to know
[11:07] <compengi> gnomefreak, but in lspci it's 1:00.0
[11:07] <feety> princemackenzie: sorry, can you simplify that. that flew right over my head.
[11:07] <gnomefreak> compengi: yes i know
[11:07] <G3N3SIS> I try to go to volume control and it says that I'm either missing my gstreamer plugins, which I just installed or it's my card.
[11:07] <gradin> well  i'm not sure what the problem is other than fail to ban is installed but not functioning...
[11:07] <strabes> G3N3SIS: restart your computer
[11:07] <toM|vendettA> no i didnt feety, should i do that?
[11:07] <G3N3SIS> I do the cat or the lspci -v and they both clearly see my card there.
[11:07] <compengi> okay let me try it, pray gnomefreak :P
[11:07] <gnomefreak> compengi:  lspci doesnt read things the same way your xorg.conf does
[11:07] <G3N3SIS> Already did strabes
[11:08] <feety> toM|vendettA: you should always do that. lol.
[11:08] <compengi> lol
[11:08] <G3N3SIS> how should i use my xorg.conf?
[11:08] <feety> :)
[11:08] <toM|vendettA> lol k
[11:08] <jerp> genesis, have you checked the mixer?
[11:08] <Tachoh> okay, here i go: tried a fresh install of ubuntu, xubuntu, and kubuntu just to test this theory. all of them seem to have the same issue. update-fonts-* is not looking in the right dirs from a fresh ubuntu install. if you were to remove any of the xfont packages and reinstall you'd get the warning: "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/$font does not exist or is not a directory" $font being anything like 100dpi 75dpi etc. what this seems to indicate is that on a fresh inst
[11:08] <G3N3SIS> alsamixer?
[11:08] <princemackenzie> feety i'll do a dialog with you
[11:08] <gradin> ompaul well  i'm not sure what the problem is other than fail to ban is installed but not functioning...
[11:08] <G3N3SIS> one sec
[11:08] <frantic> xorg.conf does not deal with sound
[11:08] <jerp> yes
[11:08] <Tachoh> please tell me i am wrong somewhere
[11:08] <G3N3SIS> alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[11:08] <G3N3SIS> sh-3.1$
[11:08] <strabes> G3N3SIS: "how should I use my xorg.conf" what do you mean by that
[11:08] <G3N3SIS> that's my error message
[11:08] <feety> princemackenzie: im not registered with nickserv yet.
[11:08] <jerp> load it
[11:08] <G3N3SIS> how do I find out if it detects my card or not.
[11:09] <ompaul> gradin, well the thing is I know nothing of fail to ban, I can do some fairly basic stuff with iptables so I am not use to you :-/
[11:09] <princemackenzie> alright feety, its pretty simple
[11:09] <gradin> ompaul i get a mail that the ip address attempting access to my SSH has been banned... but it hasn't... cuz i get another mail...
[11:09] <feety> dont worry
[11:09] <feety> just registered
[11:09] <gradin> with the same ip address...
[11:09] <gradin> saying that it has also been banned...
[11:09] <frantic> god, GO PASTEBIN
[11:09] <ekoeke> ne diyosun arkadasm sen ya
[11:09] <toM|vendettA> feety, i did that and it still doesnt show up
[11:09] <G3N3SIS> So you guys get what I mean right?
[11:09] <frantic> in the meantime, when did your sound break?
[11:09] <gnomefreak> compengi: ?
[11:09] <G3N3SIS> I only installed today.
[11:09] <strabes> G3N3SIS: it's obviously detecting your card because it's playing sounds on login
[11:10] <G3N3SIS> The tribal beat yes.
[11:10] <G3N3SIS> They said that if it did, then it wasn't my card.
[11:10] <compengi> gnomefreak, it worked :P
[11:10] <gnomefreak> :) good brb
[11:10] <jerp> load the mixer, something isn't activated in it
[11:10] <compengi> thanks alot :)
[11:10] <G3N3SIS> I can't load the mixer
[11:10] <ana> hiya, i want to dualboot ubuntu with winXP so i will need to partition the drive... will i end up overwriting any other data on the drive?  thanks
[11:10] <feety> toM|vendettA: showing the nicklist is usually in the view menu. sorry, cant help ya much further. what i do know, is that a package called 'xchat-gnome' is available in the repositories and the stupid thing requires you to click a button to see the nicklist. you sure you dont have that by accident?
[11:10] <G3N3SIS> when i type alsamixer in terminal, it gives me this error: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[11:10] <G3N3SIS> sh-3.1$
[11:10] <Tachoh> nobody eh?
[11:11] <toM|vendettA> hmm i dont know =\
[11:11] <compengi> gnomefreak, so the mistake was that i was putting PCI:1:00.0 which should be PCI:1:00:0
[11:11] <G3N3SIS> Man, my sound worked on other distro's...
[11:11] <frantic> son of a bitch, is there some other service like pastebin.com

[11:13] <computermc> configure: error: no C Sharp compiler: mcs not found in $PATH
[11:13] <frantic> genesis, here is my /etc/asound file: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35119/
[11:13] <computermc> I have mono install
[11:13] <jerp> I was blipping out over the sound not playing on my desktop and I had to load alsamixer gui in my menu and I found it had a mute switch activated
[11:13] <Tachoh> install a csharp compiler or add the utlility to your $PATH
[11:13] <gnomefreak> compengi: yes
[11:13] <jerp> flipping actually
[11:13] <frantic> you might also install alsa-oss but that's sort of a tangential problem
[11:14] <Tachoh> computermc: apt-get install mono-mcs
[11:14] <ompaul> computermc, ask in #mono it would be a better place for that
[11:14] <Tachoh> and you'll be good
[11:14] <Libra102> hello
[11:14] <Tachoh> i'll try again
[11:14] <Tachoh> "okay, here i go: tried a fresh install of ubuntu, xubuntu, and kubuntu just to test this theory. all of them seem to have the same issue. update-fonts-* is not looking in the right dirs from a fresh ubuntu install. if you were to remove any of the xfont packages and reinstall you'd get the warning: "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/$font does not exist or is not a directory" $font being anything like 100dpi 75dpi etc. what this seems to indicate is that on a fresh ins
[11:14] <frantic> anyway, compare your /etc/asound file.  When i installed edgy, it was all screwed up for me
[11:14] <frantic> though I updated from dapper.
[11:14] <G3N3SIS> i'm following the link I was given earlier.
[11:14] <Tachoh> any ideas on that,worthy of a bug report?
[11:15] <computermc> ompaul: thanks, I will ask that type of question in #mono next time!
[11:15] <G3N3SIS> It didn't work before, it is working now.. I removed my sound packages, reinstalled them, reinstalled the gnome stuff that was deleted, and I will now reboot and check a aplay -l
[11:15] <G3N3SIS> if it comes out, then I have soudn!
[11:15] <reverseblade> Tachoh, sure don't hesitate it for reporting
[11:15] <frantic> good luck
[11:15] <ompaul> Tachoh, it is worthy of a bug report, first off do updatedb and see wwhere things actually are
[11:16] <Tachoh> yeah, i guess i'll do it.
[11:16] <ana> i'm looking to find out if i dual boot ubuntu with windows if i will overwrite any data on the hard drive :)
[11:16] <Tachoh> ana: nope, not unles syou format the windows partition
[11:16] <Tachoh> you*
[11:16] <reverseblade> ana, is anything installed
[11:16] <ana> win XP and other stuffs
[11:17] <Tachoh> just make sure you select a custom disk layout
[11:17] <ana> but i have only 1 partition currently
[11:17] <reverseblade> ana, do you have empty unpartitioned area in your disk
[11:17] <Tachoh> if windows is on the wntire drive it's best to drop ina new drive or use something like partition magic to free up some space
[11:17] <Tachoh> entire*
[11:17] <ana> tachoh, yeah , i feared something like that
[11:17] <ana> cool, thanks folks :)
[11:17] <reverseblade> ana you can resize the windows partition, I have done it and no problems
=== nicu is now known as droner
[11:18] <ana> in windows utilities?
[11:18] <G3N3SIS> failure.. /cry
[11:18] <mkst_> need help on iptables
[11:18] <reverseblade> ana, no while installing ubuntu, there you should see the partitioner
[11:18] <reverseblade> mkst_, try #networking or #linux
[11:19] <G3N3SIS> yeah guys, it didn't work for me...
[11:19] <Tachoh> there are linux tools that will resize some partitions, parted comes to mind. you can read about those ana if you want. there is always the possibility of wiping the drive however.
[11:19] <reverseblade> ana, I say go for it
[11:19] <_GM_FrOdO_> hey
[11:19] <_GM_FrOdO_> people
[11:19] <ana> hahaha, easy for you to say ;)
[11:19] <_GM_FrOdO_> can semeone tell me where I go for my FAT32 patition appear?
[11:20] <reverseblade> ana, ubuntu installer will explicitly say if it intends to delete a partition
[11:20] <_GM_FrOdO_> partition*
[11:20] <ana> cool, i'll prolly drop another drive in to be extra safe :) and i'll back up first ;)
[11:20] <feety> lol using the manual partitioner is easier said than done o_o
[11:20] <G3N3SIS> So, what am I supposed to do?
[11:20] <Tachoh> _GM_FrOdO_: you mean, to allow you to see a fat32 partition that's in your computer?
[11:20] <Tachoh> as in, mount it?
[11:20] <cleo> hmm how do i change default ap[plication in edgy?
[11:20] <reverseblade> _GM_FrOdO_,  mount it

[11:24] <_GM_FrOdO_> :D
[11:24] <_GM_FrOdO_> o/
[11:24] <PsiKloPx> where do I browse the network in Kubuntu?  Nothing but web sites and ftp's in Konqueror. Thanx!
[11:24] <feety> seems everyone, being experts, are skipping over the minor details
[11:24] <gleesond> something is weird with some of the gtk menues, for some reasion its not displaying the text on the menues in xmms
[11:24] <gleesond> can anyone help
[11:24] <reverseblade> PsiKloPx, open konqurer
[11:24] <gleesond> ?
[11:24] <reverseblade> gleesond, sup _
[11:24] <reverseblade> ?
[11:25] <_GM_FrOdO_> sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
[11:25] <_GM_FrOdO_> it's correct?
[11:25] <_GM_FrOdO_> I think mine is
[11:25] <Tachoh> try it and see
[11:25] <_GM_FrOdO_> sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
[11:25] <PsiKloPx> reverseblade: got it.
[11:25] <reverseblade> _GM_FrOdO_,  read the wiki
[11:25] <_GM_FrOdO_> what is /mnt?
[11:25] <reverseblade> it is just a folder nothing special about it
[11:25] <_GM_FrOdO_> hum
[11:26] <gleesond> reverseblade: when I upgraded to edgy my menu's stoped working, well at least some of the programs.
[11:26] <gleesond> and I can't view dir's as a list in nautilus
[11:26] <SupremeBeing> I'm trying ti install GAIM, and it doesn't show up on the package lists.  Tried to install plugin for GAIM, got error (BREAK)install
[11:26] <_GM_FrOdO_> mount: de acordo com mtab, /dev/hda1 est montado em /media/hda1
[11:26] <_GM_FrOdO_> .......
[11:26] <reverseblade> gleesond, unfortunately ubgrading to edgy is problematic, back up your home folder and go for a fresh install
[11:26] <_GM_FrOdO_> it's already mounted in /media/hda1
[11:26] <reverseblade> dapper problems
[11:26] <_GM_FrOdO_> but I can't see
[11:26] <_GM_FrOdO_> :\
[11:27] <_GM_FrOdO_> I only see my Windows partition
[11:27] <gleesond> reverseblade: I will try that, but the edgy installer is not playing nice with my graphics card
[11:27] <reverseblade> SupremeBeing, search the forums as gaim beta 5
[11:27] <sushi_> How do I display the messages while ubuntu is loading (instead of the ubuntu loader bar graphic)
[11:27] <bsmntbombdood> How can I install the Gentoo kernel?
[11:27] <_GM_FrOdO_> ............
[11:28] <SupremeBeing> reverseblade: the ubuntu forums?
[11:28] <bsmntbombdood> Ubuntu is too slow be defualt
[11:28] <reverseblade> gleesond, I don't know. But for my experience, edgy is THE distro. I wish it replaced the dapper for LTS
[11:28] <Tachoh> take away slash from your kernel boot options
[11:28] <Tachoh> splash*
[11:28] <reverseblade> SupremeBeing, google: ubuntu forums
[11:28] <ompaul> bsmntbombdood, that would be a #gentoo question

[11:28] <ubotu> The Ubuntu forums can be found at http://www.ubuntuforums.org. There is also a channel on IRC Freenode #ubuntuforums.

[11:28] <sushi_> thanks a lot
[11:29] <_GM_FrOdO_> can someone help me :\
[11:29] <SupremeBeing> reverseblade: thanks
[11:29] <sushi_> gm_frodo: you need to find the installation guide.
[11:29] <reverseblade> _GM_FrOdO_, have you read the wiki ?
[11:29] <_GM_FrOdO_> yes but when I try mount
[11:29] <_GM_FrOdO_> it's say
[11:29] <bsmntbombdood> This is a #ubuntu question, I just want to know how to use the gentoo kernel in ubuntu
[11:29] <PsiKloPx> reverseblade: I've opened Konqueror and selected the network tab on the sidebar.  But as I said; nothing there but web sites and ftp's.  I'm connected to a network with one other computer (running WinXP)
[11:29] <_GM_FrOdO_> already mounted in /media/dev/hda1
[11:29] <_GM_FrOdO_> but I can't see this /media
[11:29] <_GM_FrOdO_> where is?
[11:30] <ryanakca> why do I get http://rkavanagh.homelinux.org/~ryan/mkinitrd.errpr when I run "mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.19-386 2.6.19" ?
[11:30] <kbrooks> ompaul: that wasn't called for.
[11:30] <_GM_FrOdO_> I wanna this partition in the My Computer of linux
[11:30] <kbrooks> ompaul: maybe a odd question, but we can answer anyway
[11:30] <_GM_FrOdO_> where is my CD Driver
[11:30] <_GM_FrOdO_> and etc
[11:30] <reverseblade> _GM_FrOdO_, cd /media
[11:30] <_GM_FrOdO_> :\
[11:31] <sushi_> gm_frodo: in nautilus (the file browser) CTRL+L     then /media
[11:31] <Seveas> ryanakca, because mkinitrd is ancient, you need mkinitramfs
[11:31] <Joel-Wideman> How do I set time restrictions on local logins, per user?
[11:31] <TC`> !nvidia
[11:31] <_GM_FrOdO_> but I wanna the partition in the same place of my CD Driver

[11:31] <ryanakca> Seveas: kk, thanks...
[11:31] <Seveas> _GM_FrOdO_, and I want a pony
[11:31] <sushi_> gm_frodo: better to learn general unix use first --- rather than having chat users explain every detail
[11:31] <_GM_FrOdO_> seveas I can't? :\
[11:32] <G3N3SIS> Guys,I need desperate help!
[11:32] <Joel-Wideman> it's less effort to just ask the question, G3N3SIS
[11:32] <_GM_FrOdO_> hmmmmmmmm
[11:32] <_GM_FrOdO_> ..........
[11:32] <reverseblade> PsiKloPx, try to refresh it some times smb doesn't work well, also you could try smblient -L <windows_ip> i am not sure of the syntax
[11:32] <_GM_FrOdO_> cool
[11:33] <G3N3SIS> I know.  My sound is once again troubling me to the end of this world.
[11:33] <_GM_FrOdO_> thx sushi_
[11:33] <_GM_FrOdO_> :)
[11:33] <mc44> Seveas: No pony for you!
[11:33] <Seveas> !enter
[11:33] <jughead> how do you change the default view in gnome file explorer?  I would like to have a list instead of icons
[11:33] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[11:33] <Tachoh> _GM_FrOdO_: linux works a little diffrently than what you'd expect windows to. in linux most of your devices (cd drive, etc) are put under the /dev directory. for something like removable media you'll have to mount the device to a directory before you can access the files.
[11:33] <Tachoh> you do taht usinga mount command with the source and destination
[11:33] <_GM_FrOdO_> Seveas I want a ornitorrinc
[11:33] <_GM_FrOdO_> :\
[11:33] <kbrooks> jughead: see view menu - bottom
[11:33] <Tachoh> once the device is mounted you can open a terminal/gui browser and navigate there to see your files.
[11:33] <G3N3SIS> I have tried using the sources you all gave me.  I have done lspci -v and the cat methods to see if it detects my sound.  It shows me my card.  But if i type aplay -l it says no sound card or something.
[11:33] <lullabud> _GM_FrOdO_:  one interesting thing note about linux is that pretty much everything can be addressed as a file.
[11:34] <G3N3SIS> I hear the tribal beat on logout and on boot.
[11:34] <reverseblade> G3N3SIS, tried wiki ?
[11:34] <Tachoh> this channel is chaotic :)
[11:34] <G3N3SIS> Yeah.
[11:34] <G3N3SIS> I tried the wiki someone linked me earlier.  I just retried it it.
[11:34] <Tachoh> i mean, you could do support all day long :)
[11:34] <lullabud> Tachoh:  yeah.  it always gives me mental pictures of the project mayhem kitchen.
[11:34] <Joel-Wideman> What kind of soundcard, G3N3SIS?
[11:34] <G3N3SIS> one sec
[11:35] <Tachoh> i guess that's what you get for being #1
[11:35] <G3N3SIS> alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[11:35] <jimcooncat> nfs exporting, would a 1GB network keep up with hard drive output?
[11:35] <lullabud> Tachoh:  if you want something less chaotic and more professional try #ubuntu-server
[11:35] <uruguaian> hi all

[11:37] <Tachoh> lullabud: just making an observation :)

[11:37] <lullabud> Tachoh:  i hear ya man :)
[11:37] <Seveas> G3N3SIS, don't flood the channel
[11:37] <G3N3SIS> I'm not trying to spam it up.  Someone asked me what my device was, so i pasted what it said.

[11:38] <sushi_> How do I run a program in the root window ?  Thanks!
[11:38] <xor> Ubuntu makes me vomit, a lot
[11:38] <sushi_> Specifically a .swf movie
[11:38] <Boss> list
[11:38] <reverseblade> sushi_, root window ? what do you mean ?
[11:38] <sushi_> reverseblade: like on the desktop ... where nautilus is running (WAS running)
[11:38] <jughead> kbrooks, thanks but that is only doing it for each folder, is there a way to make the list format default for every single folder I open?
[11:38] <Seveas> reverseblade, probably the X rootwindow
[11:38] <Joel-Wideman> How do I set time restrictions on local logins, per user?
[11:39] <sushi_> yes the X root window
[11:39] <G3N3SIS> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35122/ that is my pastebin thing I guess.
[11:39] <Tachoh> sushi_: if you downlaoded the swf you have two options
[11:39] <reverseblade> sushi_, I don't know how to do it, but prolly that is not what you need
[11:39] <r3tex> reverseblade, i only see a sun-java5-jre
[11:39] <Tachoh> either a) run it using adobe's free flash player (stand alone) or b) load it in a browser with flash enabled.
[11:39] <reverseblade> r3tex, try searching sdk
[11:39] <kbrooks> r3tex: no
[11:39] <lullabud> G3N3SIS:  that "available only to root" might be the reason you're not hearing sounds.
[11:39] <alek66> i get a on the sistem log loadndisdriver: loadndisdriver: load_driver(361): couldn't load driver neti2220
[11:39] <G3N3SIS> That is the sound I use VT8233.  I can't get sound from it though.  My device would be via82xx still no luck with sound.
[11:40] <alek66> how can I fix it
[11:40] <G3N3SIS> so should I login as root?
[11:40] <kbrooks> r3tex: install sun-java5-jdk
[11:40] <Seveas> !root > G3N3SIS
[11:40] <kbrooks> G3N3SIS: no.
[11:40] <G3N3SIS> Then what do I do?
[11:40] <sushi_> Tachoh: I've noticed that lots of apps have the -rootwin option available, but the flash player does not.   I want the flash game to be running on the desktop background.
[11:40] <lullabud> G3N3SIS:  try running that sound app using sudo.
[11:40] <G3N3SIS> i'm already sudo -i
[11:40] <r3tex> kbrooks, wow, weird zsh usually finds everything =P
[11:40] <lullabud> G3N3SIS:  if that works then you know that your user doesn't have rights.
[11:40] <lullabud> G3N3SIS:  hmmmmm
[11:41] <alek66> Anyone? ndiswrapper help?
[11:41] <G3N3SIS> Wait wait wait...! Got it to work
[11:41] <jimcooncat> nfs exporting, would a 1GB network keep up with hard drive output?
[11:41] <Tachoh> sushi_: you can't do that
[11:41] <lullabud> G3N3SIS:  how?
[11:41] <G3N3SIS> I had the password and everything already in use, but I was in shell.
[11:41] <Joel-Wideman> how's the alsa support for integrated sound these days? i remember it used to be very iffy
[11:41] <kbrooks> hmm
[11:41] <Tachoh> sushi_: taht's an option adobe would have to implement
[11:41] <G3N3SIS> I'm in alsamixer, but what am I supposed to do now?  That doesn't fix anything
[11:41] <Seveas> Joel-Wideman, much better than that :)
[11:41] <G3N3SIS> Thanks seveas for bringing me common sense
[11:41] <princemackenzie> sushi_ that seems intense, it just an animation or an actual game?
[11:41] <reverseblade> Joel-Wideman, de facto
[11:41] <kitche> Joel-Wideman, works for me and always have I use snd_intel8x0
[11:41] <kbrooks> how do i setup the windows key to load up apps menu thru alt+f1
[11:42] <sushi_> Tachoh: I've done it on slackware ... there was a config file in X somewhere that allowed a program to run in the root window.   I had xscreensaver running on it.  In GNOME.
[11:42] <Seveas> sushi_, xscreensaver hacks support that via the -root parameter
[11:42] <Tachoh> you've done it for a flash file?
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[11:42] <Seveas> not all aps can do that afaik
[11:42] <reverseblade> kbrooks, try gconf-editor  dive in metacity keybindings
[11:42] <Tachoh> because i am 99% sure the flash player will not allow that
[11:42] <sushi_> Seveas: ok thanks, so it is application specific.  I was told that you can run almost any program in the rootwin
[11:42] <G3N3SIS> I got the alsamixer to work, does anyone know what i'm supposed to do to make sound come out?
[11:43] <strabes> G3N3SIS: unmute everything
[11:43] <Seveas> sushi_, maybe, I said 'afaik' and am not sure :)
[11:43] <apokryphos> ubotu: sound | G3N3SIS
[11:43] <ubotu> G3N3SIS: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[11:43] <G3N3SIS> k thanks strabes
[11:43] <electro> anybody have a link to the ubuntu live-cd...haven't been able to find a recent one
[11:43] <gradin> whats a coommand to flush a log file?
[11:43] <strabes> G3N3SIS: it's a bit easier with alsamixer-gui
[11:43] <sushi_> I will post on the forums thanks guys!
[11:43] <Tachoh> sushi_: you're wlecome to prove me wrong however, if it's possible i'd like to know about it
[11:43] <mc44> electro: how recent?
[11:43] <kitche> electro: releases.ubuntu.com it's the desktop-install cd
[11:43] <G3N3SIS> how do I use the gui?
[11:43] <electro> 6.x
[11:43] <Seveas> gradin, many services flush apps when you snd them SIGHUP
[11:43] <sushi_> Tachoh: I'll let you know for sure
[11:43] <Tachoh> coolness
[11:43] <gradin> ...
[11:43] <reverseblade> electro, live CD = ubuntu Cd , there is only 1 CD
[11:44] <gradin> i just need to flush one specific log file...
[11:44] <electro> k, thanks
[11:44] <Seveas> gradin, which?
[11:44] <gradin> say /var/log/fail2ban
[11:44] <G3N3SIS> alright, so I unmuted everything.  It still says in the top right that the speaker has a mute on it.
[11:44] <strabes> G3N3SIS: sudo apt-get install alsamixer-gui I believe
[11:44] <G3N3SIS> k thanks strabes
[11:45] <Seveas> gradin, and which application writes to it?
[11:45] <gradin> Seveas fail2ban...
[11:45] <G3N3SIS> couldn't find package strabes
[11:45] <Joel-Wideman> That might be an unavailable feature, G3N3SIS - like, say, an audio output the soundcard doesn't have
[11:45] <Seveas> gradin, ok, then just restart that thing
[11:45] <strabes> G3N3SIS: sudo apt-cache search alsamixer
[11:45] <strabes> G3N3SIS: there should be something about a gui in tehre
[11:45] <gradin> Seveas how do i do that?
[11:46] <strabes> G3N3SIS: then sudo apt-get install it
[11:46] <sushi_> It's alsamixergui
[11:46] <Seveas> gradin, no idea, i don't know that app
[11:46] <kbrooks> strabes: that does not require root (searching the cache)
[11:46] <javaJake> gradin, whatcha working on?
[11:46] <whyameye> how do I get sendmail to send mail successfully through my ISP's SMTP?
[11:46] <strabes> kbrooks: thanks
[11:46] <strabes> G3N3SIS: actually the program is gnome-alsamixer
[11:46] <reverseblade> whyameye, sendmail program ?
[11:46] <PsiKloPx> reverseblade: No joy with the network.  The stupid thing is that I've done it before...I just don't remember how I did it!
[11:47] <strabes> G3N3SIS: sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer
[11:47] <gradin> ...
[11:47] <reverseblade> PsiKloPx, man smbclient, test there first
[11:47] <Raskall> how do I change the character set in ubuntu? I have american keyboard, but need norwegian. I only have command line access.
[11:47] <G3N3SIS> Do you know where it installed it at?
[11:47] <kitche> whyameye: well you have to set the client to do that but you can have sendmail grab your mail and hold it for you if you want, but you might want to look up relay server
[11:47] <javaJake> Raskall, System -> Administration -> Keyboard
[11:48] <gradin> i found out that the apache protection for fail2ban has been working everyday since i started it about 2 weeks ago and has been entering an error message cuz it couldn't access the access.log for the apache webserver
[11:48] <javaJake> Raskall, System -> Preferences -> Keyboard
[11:48] <javaJake> Sorry
[11:48] <Raskall> javaJake: erm.. I only have command line access to the system
[11:48] <gradin> so everysecond its been adding aline to the logfile...
[11:48] <ompaul> doh!
[11:48] <javaJake> Raskall, Ah, well now, that's a different matter altogether...
[11:48] <G3N3SIS> whoa, wait
[11:48] <levander> Someone can tell me how to, from the command line, figure out which kernel packages I have installed?  I don't want to know the kernel versions, just like if I have linux-686-smp or image-686-smp or what not.
[11:48] <gradin> for about 2 weeks...
[11:48] <mc44> openexit: uber ban!
[11:48] <G3N3SIS> it won't let me open it
[11:48] <G3N3SIS> unless i open thru shell
[11:48] <gradin> Seveas i restarted it and that didn't work...
[11:49] <kbrooks> AfterDeath owns AntiSpamBot ompaul
[11:49] <gradin> is there no way to just blank the file...?
[11:49] <Seveas> kbrooks, we know
[11:49] <reverseblade> levander, uname -r
[11:49] <javaJake> Raskall, let me do some googling...
[11:49] <kbrooks> Seveas: kk
[11:49] <javaJake> Raskall, do you know about lynx, and centericq?
[11:49] <Tachoh> levander: dpkg -l | grep kernel
[11:49] <Seveas> gradin, flushing a file isn't blanking a file....
[11:49] <javaJake> Raskall, those are excellent browser and IM programs for the command-line
[11:49] <Seveas> gradin, if you want to blank it, do this
[11:50] <Seveas> : > /var/log/yourlogfilehere
[11:50] <G3N3SIS> k everything has a greenbox under it
[11:50] <Raskall> javaJake: I know about both, yes. :)
[11:50] <maxamillion> who here is running amd64?
[11:50] <Raskall> maxamillion: I am
[11:50] <G3N3SIS> I unmuted EVERYTHING that means it has a greenbox under the equalizer.  Now what am I to do?  The volume slider is still giving met rouble.
[11:50] <javaJake> Raskall, setxkbmap <layout>
[11:50] <javaJake> Raskall, That'll do it.
[11:50] <G3N3SIS> I have an AMD 64 but i'm using 32 bit version
[11:50] <Raskall> javaJake: ahh.. thanks.
[11:50] <javaJake> Raskall, just need to know the name of the layout
[11:51] <javaJake> Raskall, need that too?
[11:51] <maxamillion> Raskall: i highly doubt you run pypanel, but would you mind sudo aptitude install pypanel and then try to execute it real quick? ... after i install it says pypanel is a command not found
[11:51] <G3N3SIS> strabes?
[11:51] <strabes> G3N3SIS: what
[11:51] <javaJake> maxamillion, what does "sudo updatedb && locate pypanel" say?
[11:52] <javaJake> maxamillion, or have you tried that already?
[11:52] <J-_> is efty stable enough to install, and not have too many problems with it or any of the generic programs I'll be using?
[11:52] <maxamillion> javaJake: just a min.
[11:52] <maxamillion> javaJake: /var/cache/apt/archives/pypanel_2.4-1.1_amd64.deb
[11:52] <loca|host> totem wont play rm files, it claims that there's no codec for that, how to get those codecs ?
[11:52] <strabes> G3N3SIS: you have to say people's names when you're asking people something so they can be notified about your message
[11:52] <javaJake> maxamillion, that's it?
[11:52] <G3N3SIS> Alright, guys, I've gotten alsamixer to be useable... but what else can I do?
[11:52] <javaJake> J-_, I'd advise you do as much testing as you can with the LiveCD - try to get what you need working on the LiveCD, THEN install.
[11:53] <G3N3SIS> Can i also turn off my only with root capabilities?
[11:53] <maxamillion> javaJake: yeah, i uninstalled it because it didn't work
[11:53] <javaJake> J-_, otherwise, no, use Dapper.
[11:53] <strabes> loca|host: have you been to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[11:53] <ady> does flashplayer work in Ubuntu x64
[11:53] <javaJake> maxamillion, oh, can you install it again and run the above program? :)
[11:53] <maxamillion> ady: no
[11:53] <gleesond> so I'm trying to install edgy from CD and when I go into the run/install it goes though the ubuntu loadinng screen but the it dissapears, and the screen goes black never to return
[11:53] <Seveas> ady, no
[11:53] <maxamillion> javaJake: yeah, one moment
[11:53] <J-_> javaJake: okay, i'll keep on using dapper til it's more stable. thanks =D
[11:53] <gleesond> I've tried to go into graphics safe mode to no avail
[11:53] <strabes> G3N3SIS: it shouldn't require root priv
[11:53] <ady> thought so, cheers m8, me stay with 32 bit version
[11:53] <G3N3SIS> What am I doing wrong?
[11:53] <loca|host> strabes, i know that, but am not restricted to those, and ubuntu neither since multiverse
[11:53] <G3N3SIS> Can you PM me or something?
[11:54] <gradin> Seveas permission denyed even with sudo....
[11:54] <javaJake> gleesond, huh, now that is interesting. I'd search for your video card or your system model in the Ubuntu forums.
[11:54] <strabes> loca|host: what do you mean
[11:54] <strabes> G3N3SIS: you have to be registered to PM - are you registered
[11:54] <Seveas> gradin, : | sudo tee /var/log/yourfilenamehere
[11:54] <G3N3SIS> I don't think I am on this server.
[11:54] <javaJake> J-_, Edgy is actually an unstable release - it's not meant to be fuly worked out. Fiesty Fawn is.
[11:54] <ady> can I share my printer with my other XP machine
[11:54] <G3N3SIS> nickserv
[11:55] <J-_> javaJake: okay, thanks
[11:55] <lullabud> ady:  yes you can.
[11:55] <G3N3SIS> you get that?
[11:55] <strabes> G3N3SIS: no
[11:55] <G3N3SIS> I got yours
[11:55] <mc44> javaJake: no it is a stable release, its just not totally as polished as Dapper
[11:55] <G3N3SIS> whats the command to register again?
[11:55] <ady> where can I gt info
[11:55] <G3N3SIS> -nickserv
[11:55] <strabes> G3N3SIS: try /msg strabes test
[11:55] <maxamillion> javaJake: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35126/
[11:55] <lullabud> ady:  check out samba.
[11:55] <G3N3SIS> get it?
[11:55] <ady> oki doki, cheers
[11:55] <strabes> G3N3SIS: no
[11:55] <lullabud> ady:  i think the default config for samba even includes printer sharing on windows networks.
[11:55] <gradin> ah much better thanks
[11:55] <strabes> G3N3SIS: you have to register to PM - I told you
[11:56] <G3N3SIS> whats the registration command?
[11:56] <gradin> Seveas can you explain the syntax of that command?
[11:56] <strabes> G3N3SIS: just /join #strabes
[11:56] <G3N3SIS> k
[11:56] <ady> ah good good, thanks
[11:56] <javaJake> maxamillion, besides /etc/pypanelrc, it doesn't look like any executables were installed.
[11:56] <javaJake> maxamillion, Are you sure you are supposed to be able to execute pypanel???
[11:56] <Seveas> gradin, : is the empty command, | is a pipe, sudo makes you root and tee writes to the file you give it
[11:57] <maxamillion> javaJake: yeah, thats what man pypanel says
[11:57] <javaJake> mc44, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=291671
[11:57] <maxamillion> javaJake: wait .. no, sorry .. their website
[11:57] <oxyd> hmm..
[11:57] <javaJake> maxamillion, OK.
[11:57] <ady> what is the best firewall to use with Ubuntu 6.10 I32
[11:57] <oxyd> one question
[11:57] <javaJake> ady, Firestarter.
[11:57] <gradin> Seveas tnx
[11:57] <ady> thanks mate
[11:58] <oxyd> ady: iptables
[11:58] <mc44> javaJake: yes a rant on the forums proves your point?
[11:58] <javaJake> ady, Linux comes pre-installed with a firewall, but Firestarter allows you to configure it easily.
[11:58] <oxyd> ;)
[11:58] <kurisutofuaa> How do I check if my video card supports 3D in ubuntu-Edgyamd64?
[11:58] <javaJake> mc44, lol... it wasn't a rant, it was a discussion. :)
[11:58] <maxamillion> javaJake: http://pypanel.sourceforge.net/
[11:58] <High_Priest> my friend here is trying to boot ubuntu 6.10 on compaq laptop.. without success.. after splash and progress bar he gets black screen with blinking cursor and it just stays there.. fail-safe option acts the same.. any ideas?
[11:58] <Tachoh> ubuntu's bug report #1 is funny
[11:58] <orian> Hi.   Sound problem with edgy on a Thinkpad x60. I have no sound anywhere, but had sound for two days after installing edgy. Sound works in windows . The forums, quoting this irc channel  advised to turn on the modem in my bios, however my modem was already enabled. I disabled and re-enabled it but no sound. Any ideas? Sound card is a HDA intel
[11:58] <kitche> ady: you don't need firestarter up all the time once you configure iptables you can close it
[11:58] <mc44> javaJake: a ranty discussion :p
[11:58] <javaJake> maxamillion, two seconds...
[11:58] <gradin> jeeze i wonder how much space i just saved... :P
[11:58] <strabes> Tachoh: link/
[11:58] <strabes> Tachoh: link? *
[11:58] <gleesond> javaJake: I'm not seeing anthing in the forums about my issue, can you offer anyother suggestions?
[11:58] <maxamillion> javaJake: ok, no hurry
[11:59] <mc44> orian: can you put the output of amixer in the pastebin
[11:59] <gradin> wow...
[11:59] <oxyd> hows ubuntu server works? ive tried ubuntu for 1 week, then slack was nicier,

[11:59] <levander> Aren't there two types of kernel packages, like linux-kernel and linux-image packages?
[11:59] <javaJake> mc44, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1707122&postcount=8
[11:59] <helltrix> I can't seem to download updates, etc.
[11:59] <kitche> oxyd: ubuntu server is just a barebones linux install really
[12:00] <orian> I will need some instruction on how to do that. I'm using irc on a different pc
[12:00] <levander> Tachoh: thanks, that command worked, the dpkg -l one
[12:00] <javaJake> gleesond, besides Google, and making your own thread at the Ubuntu forums, no.
[12:00] <javaJake> gleesond, where there are no answers to be found, none can be given.
[12:00] <mc44> javaJake: its still a stable release. stable just doesnt mean hat you think it does
[12:00] <Tachoh> levander: np
[12:00] <javaJake> gleesond, IOW, if searching doesn't work, then I can't help beyond that. Others may know, I don't.
[12:01] <Tachoh> there are a lot of kernel packages
[12:01] <mc44> orian: ok, type amixer into a terminal, copy and paste the output into http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
