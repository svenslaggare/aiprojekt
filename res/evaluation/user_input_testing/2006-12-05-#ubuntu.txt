[12:03] <gnomefreak> damnit
[12:03] <con-man> eltese: lol
[12:03] <BackPacker> Royito: nothing? What, no error message, you mean?
[12:04] <senator^zZz> what is the default root password in ubuntu?
[12:04] <aleka> soundray> Do I use the id_rsa or the id_rsa.pub file? sorry...
[12:04] <Royito> the same mesage error
[12:04] <mwe> senator^zZz: there is none
[12:04] <Royito> it does exit
[12:04] <mwe> senator^zZz: use sudo
[12:04] <barrosz> set one with sudo passwd
[12:04] <soundray> Royito: try this: sudo rm /home/roy/Desktop/Slayer*avi
[12:04] <senator^zZz> ok
[12:04] <mwe> !sudo | senator^zZz
[12:04] <ubotu> senator^zZz: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[12:04] <BackPacker> soundray: it's not called Slayer it's called Slayer en vivo!!.avi
[12:05] <senator^zZz> can someone give me the command line for setting the root password?
[12:05] <eltese> hey BackPacker =) it seems i dont get no dns on my second computer
[12:05] <soundray> aleka: the .pub one. The other is the private key and never leaves the machine it was generated on.
[12:05] <Tachoh> senator^zZz: sodo passwd
[12:05] <eltese> BackPacker, i can ping by ip to the internet but not hostname
[12:05] <barrosz> sudo passwd
[12:05] <mwe> barrosz: that pretty much undermines the idea of using sudo
[12:05] <Tachoh> sudo*
[12:05] <soundray> BackPacker: I know, it will work anyhow.
[12:05] <barrosz> he asked ...
[12:05] <Tachoh> try her one more time: my mic capture is turned on, mic boost is on, the mic is selected for recording, if i turn up the volume on the mic i can hear myself talk, i have the right permissions to access the sound devices, the correct modules are loaded, tried with mic 1 and mic2 in alsamixer, and the recording volume is turned up in audacity. audacity is pointing to /dev/dsp as the recording device. any idea why i get a blank line when trying to record sou
[12:05] <BackPacker> eltese: have you got DNS IPs in /etc/resolv.conf?
[12:05] <barrosz> i know ill keep it to myself next time
[12:05] <eltese> oh.. ok =) ty
[12:05] <Royito> mmm jajaja im almost by shooting my head jaja
[12:05] <Royito> no it doest exit
[12:06] <yed> i installed ubuntu dapper i386 desktop a few days ago. now i got a new motherboard and processor, AMD Athlon 64. the OS won't run (gives "hda: drive not ready for command" thousands of lines). do i need to reinstall the os from the amd64 cd?
[12:06] <mwe> barrosz: please refer folks to the wiki instead. it explains the idea of sudo and tells you how to set a root password if you insist
[12:06] <soundray> Tachoh: it's not enough to make those selections in a mixer, you need to select the microphone and mic level within audacity
[12:06] <Matthew_W> Hey guys, I'm stuck in IRSSI and no X right now - does someone know the command to install GRUB to the MBR from just a login shell?
[12:06] <CharlieSu> I have postfix installed and working.. i telneted into my localhost and send a message to my user and it is in the spool..  but how do i check this mail?  also how do i send me out on 110?  does postfix do everything or is there a second part i'm missing?
[12:07] <aleka> soundray > here's what I got when I tried to use the .pub file in PuTTY "Unable to use key file "C:\Documents and Settings\name\My Documents\id_rsa.pub" (not a private key)"
[12:07] <barrosz> sry mate! i was looking and shot a quick answer :(
[12:07] <soundray> Matthew_W: it's 'sudo grub-install'. Check man grub-install for details.
[12:07] <linux_kid> Anyone here got DynDNS to work over a Linksys WRT54G router with Apache?
[12:07] <tonyyarusso> Matthew_W: I think it's grub-install /dev/hda, if hda is the disk you want to install to.
[12:07] <BackPacker> Matthew_W:
[12:07] <Matthew_W> Which of those will put it to the MBR
[12:07] <Matthew_W> o_O
[12:07] <h00t> anyone know how can i check sfv (simple file verification) in ubuntu
[12:07] <Royito> a guy from spain tell me that i got to enter in root at the path of the file
[12:07] <Tachoh> soundray: would it help if i said it does the same thing in kde's sound recorder?
[12:08] <mbd> con-man, hey =)
[12:08] <Royito> home/roy/desktop
[12:08] <con-man> mbd sup?
[12:08] <soundray> aleka: it sounds to me like you're doing the wrong thing. Sorry, I don't know enough about PuttySSH to help (it's offtopic here anyway...)
[12:08] <Royito> YEEEEEEEEEES I DID I DID
[12:08] <Royito> I DID DID
[12:08] <mbd> BackPacker, seems i couldnt reach my old isps dns server from this one...
[12:08] <BackPacker> Royito: great!
[12:08] <mbd> con-man, its eltese =)
[12:08] <asgilder> Do I have to do anything special to dual boot?
[12:08] <con-man> mdb sweet.
[12:08] <Royito> i made enter as a root in the path
[12:08] <soundray> Royito: try to avoid filenames with exclamation marks in the future.
[12:08] <con-man> mbd: so where do we start
[12:09] <aleka> well.. afterall I am trying to connect to my Ubuntu machine... so it's not totally off topic
[12:09] <bimberi> CharlieSu: You can use evolution to read the mail, or install "mailx" to get the classic CLI mail client.  You shouldn't need anything else (after postfix) to send mail
[12:09] <yed> help please: i installed ubuntu dapper i386 desktop a few days ago on a pentium 3. now i got a new motherboard and processor, AMD Athlon 64. the OS won't run (gives "hda: drive not ready for command" thousands of lines). do i need to reinstall the os from the amd64 cd?
[12:09] <mbd> con-man,  hmm.. do u have a monitor section for both of your monitors
[12:09] <Wiseguy> hey guys, does anyone know why im not able to configure my eth1 (wireless) device in Network Tools?
[12:09] <linux_kid> asgilder nope, it will do it by itself
[12:09] <Royito> and there i write rm Slayer and pull 2 times the TAB key and enter
[12:09] <asgilder> Okay. Cool.
[12:09] <con-man> mbd: yes
[12:09] <con-man> mbd: two monitor sections
[12:10] <CharlieSu> bimberi: so postfix recieves mail from the internet and also sends mail out to the internet?
[12:10] <Royito> look at how it seems root@daunbuntu:/home/roy/Desktop# sudo rm Slayer\ en\ vivo\!\!.avi
[12:10] <Matthew_W> ls
[12:10] <mbd> con-man, hang on.. ill find a pastebin and paste my screen section
[12:10] <Royito> and get erased
[12:10] <con-man> k
[12:10] <Matthew_W> Hey - when I do grub-install it asks for a particular device to which I would like to install the stuff - is that the device like /dev/sda for example?
[12:10] <Rageagainstthis> Does anyone know of a program that downloads wmv streams.
[12:11] <BackPacker> Matthew_W: /dev/hda
[12:11] <Matthew_W> BackPacker: It's a SATA drive...
[12:11] <soundray> yed: this is worrying -- hope you have a backup. Boot from a live CD and see if you can access your data on /dev/hda
[12:11] <Royito> see backpaker?
[12:11] <BackPacker> Matthew_W: oh, ok
[12:11] <BackPacker> Royito: yes?
[12:11] <Matthew_W> BackPacker - it says "Casper-snapshot has no corresponding BIOS drive"
[12:11] <Matthew_W> EH?
[12:12] <yed> soundray: truth is i don't really need the data, i installed on a clean harddrive a few days ago. if it's quicker, i just format the drive and reinstall the os. could the problem be because i didn't plug in a floppy drive?
[12:12] <BackPacker> Matthew_W: sorry, don't know anything about SATA drives. Thought they were on the IDE bus. Obviously not...
[12:12] <Matthew_W> BackPacker I'll restart, I just redid the partition table with fdisk, so it might be wongy atm
[12:12] <Matthew_W> BackPacker - or is there a way to do that without restarting etc.
[12:12] <soundray> yed: no, in light of this new information I suspect that you haven't set the jumpers on the drives correctly.
[12:13] <bimberi> CharlieSu: yes, that's my experience.
[12:13] <mbd> con-man, http://pastebin.ca/267580
[12:13] <yed> i didn't change the jumpers from their position on my old system
[12:13] <soundray> aleka: check out this page for some background on using keys with ssh: http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/
[12:13] <yed> soundray: i didn't change the jumpers from their position on my old system
[12:13] <soundray> yed: that'll be the problem.
[12:13] <aleka> soundray... thanks
[12:14] <yed> soundray: but the same drive is master, same slave. so what can be the problem with that?
[12:14] <con-man> mbd: ok so you put your two monitor identifiers in the screen section?
[12:14] <mbd> con-man, and here is my device section http://pastebin.ca/267582
[12:14] <soundray> yed: and you're booting from a fresh install on the slave?
[12:14] <CharlieSu> bimberi: ok.. i'll see if i have this figured out then..
[12:15] <mbd> con-man, yes
[12:15] <errorlevel> A quick couple of questions:  First, I looked at my /etc/fstab and noticed some lines that have UUID=... at the beginning.  What are those?  I've never seen any other distribution use those.  Are the UUIDs needed?
[12:15] <mbd> con-man, and the interesting in device is DesktopSetup
[12:15] <soundray> yed: is this an MSI motherboard by any chance?
[12:15] <yed> soundray: yes, the new motherboard is MSI
[12:15] <Wiseguy> hye guys can anyone help me with my wireless for an ipw2200 driver?
[12:15] <mbd> con-man, and i think u can use option mode2 1024x768 if u want the secondary monitor to  have another resolution
[12:16] <mbd> con-man, but i have not tried it myself
[12:16] <mwe> errorlevel: the UUID is a hardware id. thus if you change from master to slave it still works
[12:16] <con-man> mbd: brb im restarting X
[12:16] <mbd> k
[12:16] <mwe> errorlevel: see man fstab
[12:16] <mwe> errorlevel: you can use /dev/foo if you prefer
[12:16] <ThePancakeMan> newbie question - how do I install this VMWare player 1.0.3 application?
[12:16] <Royito> somebody here knows about the leak patch?
[12:17] <soundray> yed: I had the weirdest problems with the ATIIXP IDE controller on an MSI mainboard. I gave up in the end and am now running my IDE drives from a Promise PCI controller - much better.
[12:17] <mwe> !vmare | ThePancakeMan
[12:17] <errorlevel> mwe: Okay.  Thanks on that one....
[12:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vmare - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:17] <mwe> !vmware | ThePancakeMan
[12:17] <ubotu> ThePancakeMan: VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player"). Instructions for VMWare Server can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[12:17] <soundray> yed: what helped a bit was to connect just a master drive to the primary mainboard IDE channel.
[12:18] <ThePancakeMan> I downloaded it and extracted it into a directory on my computer.  I think it is a package but I cannot get the package installer to recognize it
[12:18] <mwe> ThePancakeMan: don't do that.
[12:18] <Wiseguy> does anyone know why i am unable to configure any of my network devices under "Network Tools"
[12:18] <ThePancakeMan> don't do what?
[12:18] <mwe> ThePancakeMan: use the ubuntu packages instead. see what ubotu said
[12:18] <Royito> somebody here knows about the leak patch?
[12:18] <ThePancakeMan> Oh, OK. thx
[12:19] <Xamusk> is it safe to resize a NTFS partition through ubuntu's installer? (in a SATA drive)
[12:19] <visik7> anyone here of ubuntu laptop ?
[12:19] <soundray> Wiseguy: what are the network devices that you are expecting to see there?
[12:19] <errorlevel> Now, my second question is this:  Is there a "prefered" way of adding new partitions to the /etc/fstab (like some graphical partition mounter) or can I just edit my /etc/fstab in Vim?
[12:19] <Kervan> hello i have a problem about hp psc 1210. i can use my printer from windows but when i send a job from linux likes printing but i take a blank page.. my color cartige is empity. But i send black document
[12:19] <BackPacker> visik7: are you asking if anyone's using ubuntu on a laptop?
[12:19] <mwe> Xamusk: pretty safe. not 100% though
[12:19] <Xamusk> mwe, what are the problems?
[12:19] <ezenu> Anyone know how to restore the old boot-up behavior of displaying those status messages showing, rather than that edgy image? I was able to remove the image by removing splash from grub config, but now it only shows something like "Starting up.." in text -- no messages
[12:19] <visik7> BackPacker: mm not exactly
[12:19] <yed> soundray: i tried that in the begining, didn't boot. i think my master is not bootable, and i have a GRUB multi-boot program on my slave which boots and then hands over control to the master.
[12:20] <Wiseguy> soundray: lo, eth0, and eth1 are all in the list, but when i select them i am unable to choose the configure button next to it
[12:20] <soundray> errorlevel: attack it with vim, that's best in my experience
[12:20] <visik7> BackPacker: anyone of ubuntu laptop team
[12:20] <mwe> Xamusk: potentially you could loose all data and destroy the partition. it rarely happens though
[12:20] <senator^zZz> I cant figure it out, can someone tell me exactly what commandline to write to set root password... not just use sudo
[12:20] <Xamusk> mwe, ok, thanks... I'll try it
[12:20] <errorlevel> soundray: Okay.  I just didn't know what kind of tools ubuntu has that might /etc/fstab to be in a certain format.  But, yes.  I will attack away. =)
[12:20] <errorlevel> soundray: Thanks. =)
[12:20] <PhantasyHawk> Can someone help me find the packages I need to read encrypted DVDs?
[12:20] <yed> soundray: do you think making a fresh install of the AMD64 version on the master would help?
[12:21] <[GuS] > Re..
[12:21] <[GuS] > PhantasyHawk, you need libdvdcss
[12:21] <soundray> yed: I think you will fare best with a PCI controller like I do. Otherwise, exchange your board for a better one. I'm completely fed up with MSI.
[12:21] <oem> can someone help me with changing permissions to a partition from terminal?
[12:21] <PhantasyHawk> Is it in the repos?  Ive scanned synaptic for it with no luck
[12:21] <dsnyders> !lvm
[12:21] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[12:21] <BackPacker> senator^zZz: you want to set root's password at the command line, right?
[12:21] <soundray> yed: it won't matter whether you go with AMD64 or i386.
[12:21] <[GuS] > i think no PhantasyHawk , but there is packages in the net
[12:21] <[GuS] > just search in google ;)
[12:21] <PhantasyHawk> alright
[12:21] <PhantasyHawk> thanks a bunch
[12:21] <[GuS] > :)
[12:21] <senator^zZz> BackPacker yes
[12:22] <BackPacker> senator^zZz: ok, if you're sure you know what you're doing, try this: "sudo su" followed by "passwd"
[12:22] <oem> or at least how to change permissions on it using the file browser
[12:22] <ThePancakeMan> I have enabled all the repositories in the Synaptic package manager, reloaded, and searched for vmware-player as instructed, but I get nothing???
[12:22] <senator^zZz> BackPacker Ok I try... brb
[12:22] <soundray> BackPacker: please, this is a double no-no.
[12:22] <BackPacker> soundray: ?
[12:23] <T`> how do i list nfs mounts in ubuntu?
[12:23] <concept10> ezenu, what does your kernel line say now?
[12:23] <T`> df and mount dont show them
[12:23] <yed> soundray: so ubuntu i installed from i386 should run fine even though i changed the motherboard and processor to AMD64 system?
[12:23] <BackPacker> T`: showmount -e
[12:23] <[GuS] > PhantasyHawk, http://www.debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/libd/libdvdcss/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-0.0_i386.deb
[12:23] <soundray> BackPacker: for people who need a root shell, please advise using 'sudo -i', not 'sudo su', because you end up with a mixed-up environment.
[12:23] <mbd> damnit
[12:23] <T`> BackPacker, i dont have that app.. will install.. but why isn't it shown in mount/df ?
[12:23] <mbd> seems it didnt work for con-man
[12:23] <user-land> Hello, is there a way to do a disk check/repair in Ubuntu ?
[12:23] <ezenu> concept10, I changed this line: kernel         /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash   -- and removed the splash portion
[12:23] <CharlieSu> bimberi: so for people to email me the only port i need to open would be 25 correct?  what would 110 be for?
[12:23] <BackPacker> soundray: ok, will do
[12:24] <concept10> ezenu, remove quiet
[12:24] <oem> and the wiki is useless
[12:24] <senator^zZz> BackPacker doesnt work, just gives a promt that says Password: and when I type in a password it says Sorry, try again
[12:24] <PhantasyHawk> [GuS] , that worked like a charm.  Thanks a ton
[12:24] <[GuS] > your welcome :)
[12:24] <concept10> ezenu, and you see all messages
[12:24] <soundray> BackPacker: and telling people how to set the root password should always be accompanied by a *dire* warning.
[12:24] <ezenu> concept10, ah, ok, thanks
[12:24] <BackPacker> T`: hold on.. just checking something
[12:24] <soundray> senator^zZz: please don't set a root password.
[12:25] <BackPacker> soundray: ok, thanks for the heads-up
[12:25] <soundray> senator^zZz: the favoured approach in Ubuntu, using sudo, is much safer.
[12:25] <oem> can someone help me with something?
[12:25] <senator^zZz> I need to log in as root to configure xwindows
[12:25] <senator^zZz> it wont work
[12:25] <mbd> BackPacker, as u can see, it is working now :D thanks again and have a nice day //eltese
[12:25] <soundray> senator^zZz: no, you don't. Use 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[12:25] <soundray> senator^zZz: or get a root shell with sudo -i
[12:26] <senator^zZz> brb try that
[12:26] <BackPacker> T`: you need to have nfs-common and nfs-kernel-server installed
[12:26] <oem> or do I need to just keep asking?
[12:26] <BackPacker> mbd: (eltese): great!
[12:26] <T`> BackPacker, but i'm just using a client!
[12:26] <Wiseguy> soundray, you got any ideas for me?
[12:27] <oem> or do I need to just keep asking?
[12:27] <ThePancakeMan> OK, I was not using su to install.  I think I've got it thanks to the tip here.  Thanks!
[12:27] <soundray> Wiseguy: sorry, I overlooked your response. Are you on dapper or edgy>
[12:27] <soundray> ?
[12:27] <geokok> hi. If I install something from source (make, make install) how do I un-install it afterwards?
[12:27] <Wiseguy> edgy
[12:27] <BackPacker> oem: try asking your question
[12:28] <oem> I did Backpacker
[12:28] <BackPacker> oem: maybe everybody missed it
[12:28] <oem> I asked if someone could help me learn how to change permissions to a partition in terminal
[12:28] <con-man> mbd: it works at the login in screen but as  soon as a login, my monitors revert back to being a mirror of each other
[12:28] <aleka> How do I map my web document root outside of the default to where I want it in apache2?
[12:28] <Polysics> hello all!
[12:28] <senator^zZz> soundray It wont work, it asks for root password
[12:28] <oem> I asked it a fwe times
[12:28] <BackPacker> geokok: depends on what it was you installed
[12:28] <Polysics> anyone has some time to waste on my modem?
[12:28] <Polysics> scanModem output is ugly :-)
[12:28] <BackPacker> oem: what do you mean by "permissions to a partition"?
[12:29] <soundray> Wiseguy: please try 'System-Administration-Networking' (rather than -Tools)
[12:29] <oem> I was running breezy, but it wouldn't updat to dapper
[12:29] <oem> so I bought a book with a dapper distro
[12:29] <soundray> senator^zZz: enter your user password at the prompt.
[12:29] <oem> thinking it would upgrade
[12:29] <geokok> BackPacker: Actually I havent done it yet cause of my question. Can u give me an example so I can learn?
[12:29] <Polysics> i'm probaly stuck up THAT creek without a paddle since it's a notebook modem, but i was still hoping :-)
[12:29] <oem> but what it did was intall the OS instead of update
[12:29] <soundray> senator^zZz: also, please spend a bit of time with the docs that ubotu suggests:
[12:29] <BackPacker> geokok: the easiest way is to delete the files
[12:30] <oem> so now I havemy old volume that i can only read a part of
[12:30] <soundray> !sudo | senator^zZz
[12:30] <ubotu> senator^zZz: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[12:30] <senator^zZz> soundray what userpassword? I have not set a userpassword yet... I wanna know how to set the userpassord
[12:30] <con-man> mbd: any ideas?
[12:30] <vcef> hi
[12:30] <soundray> senator^zZz: during the Ubuntu installation, you were asked to set a user password.
[12:30] <mbd> did u add Option     "DesktopSetup" "horizontal" to the device section?
[12:30] <geokok> BackPacker: so it all goes into a directory i can just delete? I assume that I wont be getting any updates for that app though right?
[12:30] <oem> and sometimes it loads the partition to read and other times it doesn't
[12:30] <soundray> senator^zZz: that's also the one you used to log in.
[12:31] <senator^zZz> soundray no, this is ubuntu lite... there was no such question
[12:31] <BackPacker> geokok: it could go into several directories
[12:31] <vcef> I've installed mprime (distributed prime searching) and it really slowes down my other programs.
[12:31] <con-man> mbd: yes i did. and now at the login screen extended desktop is enbaled. but as soon as I login it reverts back to mirror desktop
[12:31] <oem> so now I am trying to get out of reformating everytyhing and just using the partiotn
[12:31] <BackPacker> oem: and there's an entry for the partition in /etc/fstab?
[12:31] <dsquare> i have booted ubuntu from the live CD to partition my drive, how do i get the partition package?
[12:31] <oem> but alas I cannot even use the freespace on the partition
[12:31] <geokok> BackPacker: in that case I dont think I am up to it yet
[12:31] <vcef> It is already niced, but it doesn't help much.
[12:31] <oem> its unde /media/scsidisk
[12:31] <mbd> con-man, hmm....
[12:32] <soundray> senator^zZz: oh, ubuntu-lite is experimental as far as I know.
[12:32] <vcef> So is there a kernel package for Edgy with kernel that can handle batch scheduling?
[12:32] <con-man> mbd: what would cause that?
[12:32] <Polysics> no one has experience with modems then?
[12:32] <BackPacker> geokok: there's probably a way to create a .deb package using the checkinstall utility. Check it out
[12:32] <mbd> con-man, i have no idea why that is.. im sorry
[12:32] <senator^zZz> there must be a command just to set the rootpassword in ubuntu... something like settpass root
[12:32] <mbd> con-man, u could try 2 screen sections.. but then u cant move windows between the screens
[12:32] <con-man> does anyone know why exteneded desktop works at the login screen, but is disabled right when i log in
[12:32] <senator^zZz> but more complicated
[12:32] <BackPacker> oem: and is there an entry for it in /etc/fstab?
[12:32] <oem> when I ls fstab it shows emtpy
[12:32] <geokok> BackPacker: Ok then..off to break my system ;) thanks
[12:33] <BackPacker> geokok: welcome!
[12:33] <con-man> mbd: will i have two separate screens?
[12:33] <soundray> senator^zZz: what do you get when you enter 'sudo -i' and just hit Return at the password prompt?
[12:33] <BackPacker> oem: fstab is empty????
[12:33] <con-man> mbd: will i have two separate screens with two spearate cubes?
[12:33] <dsquare> what is the ubuntu partition manager name please?
[12:33] <senator^zZz> soundray I get Sorry, try again
[12:33] <senator^zZz> its wrong password
[12:33] <dsquare> the gui one
[12:33] <BackPacker> dsquare: gparted
[12:33] <senator^zZz> and I have not set a password for rootaccount
[12:33] <oem> I did 'ls /etc/fstab' and it showed me nothing
[12:33] <dsquare> thanks
[12:34] <BackPacker> oem: do 'cat /etc/fstab'
[12:34] <soundray> senator^zZz: is your prompt a $ or a # ?
[12:34] <mbd> con-man, yes. but, as i said.. u cant move windows between the screens, u have to have the launchers on the screen u want the program on
[12:34] <senator^zZz> $
[12:34] <con-man> can i move the mouse between them?
[12:34] <mbd> con-man, w8 and i will paste the serverlayout i use for that mode
[12:34] <mbd> con-man, yes
[12:34] <oem> ok what info do I need to tell you?
[12:34] <user-land> nautilus hangs while opening a folder, did you see this happen too ?
[12:34] <mbd> con-man, ofc =) would be kinda pointless otherwise, no? =)
[12:34] <soundray> senator^zZz: where did you get ubuntu-lite?
[12:35] <bimberi> CharlieSu: (sorry got called away) yes that's right.  Installing postfix opens port 25 (it might only be open to localhost I'm not sure) port 110 is pop3 which is used if you run a mailserver (dovecot for example) to allow people to collect mail remotely
[12:35] <BackPacker> oem: look for a line referring to /media/scsidisk
[12:35] <iStirk> For some reason, when I try to install Ubuntu I get an "Unable to start in graphics mode" error. Any ideas what could be causing this? I have an nVidia Geforce 6800 graphics card
[12:35] <senator^zZz> soundray hmmm.... http://ftp.cse.yzu.edu.tw/ftp/Linux/Ubuntu/ubuntulite/
[12:35] <vcef> where do I find how ubuntu kernel differs from vanilla?
[12:35] <mbd> con-man,  http://pastebin.ca/267605  the serverlayout named DualScreen is the interesting one
[12:35] <oem> none only sda3,sda6 and hdc under /dev
[12:36] <con-man> mbd: will the screens share the 4 desktops? or will there now be 8?
[12:36] <oem> and onel isting as proc
[12:36] <b0ss_> is there a way to put your whole ubuntu system under a proxy??
[12:36] <mbd> con-man, there will be 8
[12:36] <con-man> mbd: damn,
[12:36] <mbd> con-man, yeah :\
[12:36] <CharlieSu> bimberi: so if nobody needs to collect it remotely then i'm good..  for example if i use squirrelmail i wouldn't need that
[12:36] <BackPacker> oem: so the volume is probably being mounted automatically by hal or automount or something
[12:36] <b0ss_> is there a way to put your whole ubuntu system under a proxy??
[12:36] <con-man> mbd: I wanted 4 desktops, and i could just rotate the cube the way i wanted it
[12:36] <mbd> con-man, i would use that layout, if it worked with wine/pokersoftware
[12:36] <iStirk> For some reason, when I try to install Ubuntu I get an "Unable to start in graphics mode" error. Any ideas what could be causing this? I have an nVidia Geforce 6800 graphics card
[12:36] <oem> yes pmount
[12:36] <BackPacker> oem: Is this the disk you tried upgrading to Dapper on?
[12:36] <CharlieSu> bimberi: also..  my postfix file says mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, does that mean i will not get mail from outside?
[12:36] <Polysics> i wonder how it is so hard to find out WHICH modem i have... shouldn't firmware say it somewhere?
[12:36] <soundray> senator^zZz: it doesn't seem to be an 'official' ubuntu project to me.
[12:36] <oem> yes
[12:36] <Rprp> bash: php: command not found, does someone know how i can run is from a command?
[12:37] <oem> I have a single drive
[12:37] <con-man> mbd: i wanted each screen to have the same cube, but the cube would rotate independantly on each screen
[12:37] <soundray> senator^zZz: why did you go for the lite rather than the full ubuntu?
[12:37] <senator^zZz> soundray no ubuntulite.org had no download links
[12:37] <BackPacker> oem: and it's the one that's mounted on /media/scsidisk?
[12:37] <oem> yes
[12:37] <senator^zZz> so someone told me here a few days ago about that link instead
[12:37] <Agrajag> it sure does have a lot of links to other things in its download area
[12:37] <mbd> con-man, xinerama and dualscreen seems to be the only ways.. only ways ive found out about atleast.. mail to ati&amd and complain and explain how u want it to work
[12:37] <bluefox83> tab ish ebil >.>
[12:37] <Rprp> bash: php: command not found, does someone know how i can run is from a command?
[12:37] <soundray> senator^zZz: why did you go for the lite rather than the full ubuntu?
[12:37] <BackPacker> oem: and just to get it clear, it's one of the partitions on this disk that you can't access?
[12:38] <mbd> con-man, yeah, me too.. and that each screen had its own task list (in xfce, dont know how it is in gnome)
[12:38] <senator^zZz> soundray because the computer is 200mhz and 32mb ram
[12:38] <oem> I have a 250g disk, when I installed dapper I made small partition of 25g thinking I would be able to delete the partition that had breezy
[12:39] <oem> but it doesn't want to read the memory partition breezy was using
[12:39] <barktpolar> If I try to download a ISO from a torrent while the connection is firewalled, Will it corrupt the download?
[12:39] <Rprp> bash: php: command not found, does someone know how i can run is from a command?
[12:39] <mjr> no
[12:39] <BackPacker> oem: so you installed dapper on the 25g partition?
[12:39] <oem> yes
[12:40] <BackPacker> oem: and it's the breezy partition that you can't access?
[12:40] <oem> right
[12:40] <IdleOne> barktpolar, it shouldnt affect the file
[12:40] <BackPacker> oem: do you know the partition name?
[12:40] <senator^zZz> soundray do you know how to set the root password? or do you think there might be a backdoor version with a rootpassword already set?
[12:40] <iStirk> For some reason, when I try to install Ubuntu I get an "Unable to start in graphics mode" error. Any ideas what could be causing this? I have an nVidia Geforce 6800 graphics card.
[12:40] <oem> should have been sda1
[12:40] <BackPacker> oem: have you tried manually mounting /dev/sda1?
[12:41] <soundray> senator^zZz: on a normal ubuntu, you can force a root password with 'sudo passwd'. But you have to know the user password in order to do this.
[12:41] <oem> I am not that familiar with terminal yet, part of why I came here
[12:41] <bimberi> CharlieSu: if i've got it right, that means that only local users can use postfix to send mail (so you won't be a spam gateway).  receiving is another issue.  do a 'sudo netstat -plunt' and see if it is listening on 0.0.0.0:25
[12:41] <soundray> senator^zZz: what you could try is boot in recovery mode, which opens a root shell without a password if it's standard.
[12:41] <transgress_> i've been having some problems with the bcm43xx modules causing my computer to hang
[12:41] <BackPacker> oem: ok, try the following. First, open a terminal and enter "mkdir /mnt/breezy" (without the quotes)
[12:41] <senator^zZz> soundray ok ubuntulite.org doenst conatin alot of information so I guess I will get not further then
[12:42] <soundray> senator^zZz: from there, you can just run 'passwd'
[12:42] <Lam_> when i load a cd rom in the drive, half of the files are named correctly, but the other half are named wrong with these 001, 002, 00a, 00c like suffixes. what's going on?
[12:42] <BackPacker> oem: sorry, that should be "sudo mkdir /mnt/breezy"
[12:42] <soundray> senator^zZz: did it install grub?
[12:42] <transgress_> it'll stop it from rebooting saying it can't restart the hardware, and i can't open new items, but the ones i have opened work fairly normally
[12:42] <transgress_> anyone familiar with this?
[12:42] <senator^zZz> soundray I will try recoverymode now... thanks... brb
[12:42] <oem> done
[12:42] <t_u_x> w
[12:43] <umista_> how can uninstall vmware?
[12:43] <bimberi> CharlieSu: I'm fairly sure that by default, postfix is set up to receive mail from outside, but it will only accept it for local users
[12:43] <BackPacker> oem: now do this: "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/breezy"
[12:43] <webmaren> i can't compile anything
[12:43] <BackPacker> oem: Ooops! should be "sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/breezy"
[12:44] <BackPacker> oem: I'll remember that 'sudo' one of these days...
[12:44] <umista_> is there a ./ remove?
[12:44] <webmaren> everytime i run a configure script it says "c compiler cannot create executables
[12:44] <gbw> hello, i am trying to run an application, but it tells me that exec: 8: /usr/local/esterelv5_21/bin/strlsh: not found, although there is such file in the directory
[12:44] <oem> its ok I rememebered to
[12:44] <oem> dpne
[12:44] <qsuc> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI tells me how to install the ati drivers for my X700, but how can I do that when Ubuntu crashes every time it tries to load the GUI?
[12:44] <BackPacker> oem: now do "ls -l /mnt/breezy"
[12:44] <BackPacker> oem: do you get a directory listing?
[12:45] <bimberi> webmaren: install build-essential
[12:45] <webmaren> qsuc, do you have another machine
[12:45] <oem> yep
[12:45] <CharlieSu> bimberi: it is listening..
[12:45] <CharlieSu> bimberi: how can i make sure it will only accept mail for local users?  the main.cf file doesn't have man options by default
[12:45] <qsuc> no
[12:45] <BackPacker> oem: then the partition is probably ok. You could mount it the way I said, but really you'd want it to mount automatically
[12:45] <qsuc> well i mean i do
[12:45] <con-man> mbd: im having the same issue with this setup
[12:45] <webmaren> qsuc, live near a library
[12:46] <con-man> mbd: its fine at the login screen
[12:46] <qsuc> webmaren: why? to read the instructions
[12:46] <soundray> gbw: this strlsh itself contains a reference to a file that doesn't exist.
[12:46] <oem> it does sometimes, but the problem is that I cannot execute or wrtie
[12:46] <con-man> mbd: as soon as I login it goes back to mirror desktop
[12:46] <qsuc> webmaren - i do but it's windows xp?
[12:46] <Lam_> how do i re-execute fstab to remount anything i've unmounted?
[12:46] <webmaren> qsuc, you could print out the instruction and run them in safe mode
[12:46] <soundray> gbw: what do you get from 'head -n 1 /usr/local/esterelv5_21/bin/strlsh'?
[12:46] <gbw> soundray,  ohh, but i dont know which file it is loking for
[12:46] <con-man> does anyone know why my extended desktop works at the login screen, but turns off as soon as I log in?
[12:46] <BackPacker> oem: when you say "sometimes" do you know what is is that makes the difference?
[12:46] <qsuc> recovery mode from pressing exit when ubuntu is loading? webmaren
[12:46] <oem> nope
[12:47] <gbw> soundray, it is a binary file
[12:47] <webmaren> qsuc, hit escape at the GRUB menu, and then select recovery mode
[12:47] <qsuc> sweet, thanks webmaren
[12:47] <webmaren> anytime
[12:47] <senator^zZz> soundray thanks it worked... the default root password in ubuntu lite 1.1 was xxxx
[12:47] <umista_> is there a way to change the res on from grub to my bootup screen
[12:47] <senator^zZz> finally
[12:47] <Corbeaux> lol, i left the ubuntu cd in my drive and it booted into ubuntu up when windows crash
[12:47] <gbw> soundray, i got a bunch of unreadable characters
[12:47] <TuxProbe> hello fellow tux'ers.. i came to find sudo as the most powerfull tool to use while implementing root-desktop-scripts on my user desktop...
[12:48] <soundray> gbw: if you're experienced or adventurous, you could run your application with strace
[12:48] <BackPacker> oem: with disks that are mounted from /etc/fstab, you can specify the perms there. With automounted SCSI disks, I just don't know
[12:48] <bimberi> CharlieSu: sorry, that i'm really not sure about.  Either someone else here knows postfix config better than I or it's to the Doco for you :)
[12:48] <oem> when I go to properties of /media/scsi it tells me I am not the owner of the directory so I cannot change anything
[12:48] <TuxProbe> how can i make the sudo prompt for a password via gui?!
[12:48] <con-man> does anyone know why my extended desktop works at the login screen, but turns off as soon as I log in?
[12:48] <bimberi> TuxProbe: gksudo
[12:48] <iStirk> For some reason, when I try to install Ubuntu I get an "Unable to start in graphics mode" error. Any ideas what could be causing this? I have an nVidia Geforce 6800 graphics card.
[12:48] <CharlieSu> bimberi: Doco for me lol.. thanks bud.. you have helped out a lot
[12:48] <TuxProbe> i figured, if any dist knew about sudo - it would be ubuntu..
[12:48] <BackPacker> oem: that's because it's automounted
[12:48] <oem> ah is the a good wiki page on how to move the scsidisk to fstab?
[12:48] <bimberi> CharlieSu: cool :)
[12:48] <con-man> anyone?
[12:48] <con-man> anyone at all?
[12:48] <TuxProbe> bimberi: gksudo is not in gentoo's vocabulary
[12:48] <umista_> is there a way to change the res on from grub to my bootup screen
[12:48] <gbw> soundray, can you try this application http://www-sop.inria.fr/meije/esterel/getting-esterel.html,  i must get it working, it is seterell compiler
[12:48] <TuxProbe> bimberi: is it a deb pkg?
[12:49] <con-man> :'(
[12:49] <BackPacker> oem: I've just about reached the end of my knowledge on this. I know how linux handles IDE but not SCSI
[12:49] <Lam_> how do i remount anything that i've unmounted through fstab?
[12:49] <bimberi> TuxProbe: this is #ubuntu though :)
[12:49] <con-man> can anyone help me?
[12:49] <oem> btw there is no fstab under /etc
[12:49] <con-man> oem: lies
[12:49] <bimberi> TuxProbe: it's part of the "gksu" package
[12:49] <soundray> oem: create a directory with 'sudo mkdir /media/scsi/accessforall' and make it read-writable for everyone with 'sudo chmod 777 /media/scsi/accessforall'
[12:49] <oem> I am looking sat the directory right now
[12:49] <BackPacker> oem: but you just told me that you got a directory listing from "cat /etc/fstab"!
[12:49] <con-man> does anyone know why my extended desktop works at the login screen, but turns off as soon as I log in?
[12:50] <oem> Hey this thing is possesed
[12:50] <bimberi> TuxProbe: and apologies, i didn't read all of your posts
[12:50] <con-man> ???
[12:50] <TuxProbe> bimberi: A library for integration of su into applications! just what i needed thx :)
[12:50] <oem> I went in the file browser to /etc
[12:50] <con-man> no one can help me?
[12:50] <BackPacker> oem:  let me guess: it's back, right?
[12:50] <oem> and found no fstab driectory
[12:50] <bimberi> TuxProbe: np :)
[12:50] <con-man> there are 900 ppl in this channel
[12:50] <soundray> gbw: your best bet is to install the RPM package with alien
[12:50] <soundray> !alien | gbw
[12:50] <Ubotwo> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[12:51] <Dragen> oem: fstab is a file.  not a directory
[12:51] <sindrum> con: what kind of gpu do you have?
[12:51] <con-man> ati
[12:51] <gbw> soundray, strace gives me string like this access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK) and i dont have such file
[12:51] <con-man> sindrum: ati
[12:51] <con-man> sindrum: x1600
[12:51] <oem> <-- idiot,
[12:51] <TuxProbe> bimberi: it depends on the sudo pkg? or can i safely uninstall that and use this library?
[12:51] <sindrum> con: same as mine
[12:51] <gbw> soundray, it is not an rpm package, it is tgz
[12:51] <oem> I was looking for a directory not a file
[12:51] <Dragen> oem, lol it's a common mistake
[12:51] <BackPacker> oem:  it's the file that specifies what gets mounted where
[12:52] <con-man> sindrum: any ideas?
[12:52] <sindrum> con: I cant help you with that exact problem but i can say ati cards dont work right in ubuntu...
[12:52] <oem> ok so thats the first stop in fixing it
[12:52] <con-man> sindrum: mine works fine except for that one issue
[12:52] <BackPacker> oem: what is?
[12:52] <oem> fstab
[12:52] <Dragen> oem: be careful what you change in there, because you can make your linux distro non-bootable
[12:52] <oem> I assume I need to create a line for sda1 there
[12:52] <sindrum> con: did you try ubuntuforums ?
[12:52] <cntb-guest> default install from alternateCD gives me some animation of minimize a window . want to disable those  animated rectangles
[12:52] <bimberi> TuxProbe: I doubt it.  If it's a dependency....
[12:52] <TuxProbe> bimberi: aw why would I anyways - thx, ill blog my script results for u all :)
[12:53] <con-man> sindrum: the forums are slow
[12:53] <sindrum> there usually good at finding out whats wrong
[12:53] <BackPacker> oem: if it's being automounted by pmount then there will be a configuration file for it somewhere else, I think
[12:53] <con-man> sindrum: ill try them if i have to
[12:53] <oem> hmm so look for a config file for pmount?
[12:53] <BackPacker> oem: but I don't know how linux handles automounted SCSI disks...
[12:53] <soundray> gbw: sorry, you will have to ask the author of this compiler to help you get it running on Ubuntu.
=== salkot2 is now known as salkot
[12:53] <BackPacker> oem: and I dont know how pmount works, either
[12:54] <BackPacker> oem: maybe someone else here does...
[12:54] <gbw> ahh so it is only for redhat
[12:54] <Dragen> oem: do you see the SCSI device being mounted in 'fstab'?
[12:54] <gbw> damn it
[12:54] <oem> no
[12:54] <oem> well yes
[12:54] <soundray> gbw: as it is, they've tailored it to RedHat 6.0, and this is next to impossible to install on your system.
[12:54] <BackPacker> oem: :-)
[12:54] <oem> it has sda6 and sda3 but not sda1
[12:54] <Dragen> oem: then that's where it's being mounted
[12:54] <Kervan> please help what packages i need to use hp psc 1210
[12:54] <Kervan> i have installed hlip but i cant use
[12:54] <BackPacker> oem: I wish you'd said that earlier...
[12:54] <gbw> i will try the windows version
[12:55] <oem> sda1 is in the pmount file
[12:55] <pibarnas> Could I fix the apt when it blows out?!? Well, every software based on it isn't opening... how could I recover it?? I'm using edgy...
[12:56] <soundray> pibarnas: what do you get from 'sudo apt-get -f install'? Please paste the output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:56] <BackPacker> oem: what makes you think pmount is automounting sda1?
[12:56] <pibarnas> <soundray> I will!
[12:56] <maxxism> Hey all.  Did they remove the K7 Kernel builds from Edgy???
[12:57] <bimberi> !generic | maxxism
[12:57] <maxxism> lame
[12:57] <con-man> does anyone know why my extended desktop works at the login screen, but turns off as soon as I log in?
[12:57] <oem> because I am looking at the file pmount.allow and it is ther, plus when I go to the computer it shows it as a 215.g volume and anytime I try to do anyting to it its gives a message about pmount
[12:57] <bimberi> maxxism: argh, no bot :|

[12:58] <con-man> does anyone know why my extended desktop works at the login screen, but turns off as soon as I log in?
[12:58] <bimberi> argh, it's a generic flood
[12:58] <pibarnas> <soundray> ooops, okay... sorry!
[12:58] <PinauD> hi
[12:58] <PinauD> does anyone know how to use fortran?
[12:58] <pibarnas> <soundray> It's there: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35342/
[12:58] <oem> is it as simple as deleting /dev/sda from the pmount file, and writing it in the fstab file?
[12:59] <BackPacker> oem: that could be your problem, if it's in pmount.allow but not in fstab. Especially if the other partitions are in fstab
[12:59] <asgilder> I've got ubuntu installed, and the hard drive I had it installed to is also my music hard drive. How do I find the files with the music? I think they're in another partition on the drive.
[12:59] <Kervan> soundray: hpijs installed allready
[12:59] <con-man> does anyone know why my extended desktop works at the login screen, but turns off as soon as I log in?
[12:59] <soundray> !printing | Kervan

[01:00] <oem> should I just copy the same info from the other ext3 sda3?
[01:00] <xen> Quick question.  Overall, what has better support on linux: nvidia or ati?
[01:00] <thoreauputic> nvidia
[01:00] <tonyyarusso> nvidia
[01:00] <BackPacker> oem: you mean in /etc/fstab?
[01:00] <dimach> !kernel | dimach
[01:00] <Kervan> ubotu: i have installed all tools about hp and cups
[01:00] <ubotu> dimach: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[01:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i have installed all tools about hp and cups - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:00] <soundray> pibarnas: this is serious. If it was my system, I would back up the data and reinstall
[01:00] <oem> yes
[01:00] <peder_> Dec 5 01:08:11 pedbar authdaemond: libauthvchkpw.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory <- Anyone experienced same problem?
[01:00] <con-man> does anyone have any idea
[01:00] <BackPacker> oem: not exactly. Can you show me what one of the lines says?
[01:00] <oem> /dev/sda3       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
[01:01] <con-man> my extended desktop works at the login screen, but turns off as soon as I log in?
[01:01] <bimberi> asgilder: is it already mounted? check with 'df'  otherwise use 'sudo fdisk -l' to see the partitions and then you can mount the one you want
[01:01] <BackPacker> oem: that was fast!
[01:01] <Dragen> lol
[01:01] <oem> I was already heading there
[01:01] <oem> I was thinkg just change sda3 to sda1
[01:01] <BackPacker> oem: copy the line, change the sda3 to sda1, change the / to wherever you want it mounted
[01:01] <con-man> im sooo close
[01:01] <pibarnas> <soundray> Well, I suspected that! I'll start to backup up the system...
[01:01] <con-man> why would it do that
[01:01] <con-man> once i get that fixed im set
[01:01] <BackPacker> oem: if you don't change the / it won't work. It will try to mount it on top of the root filesystem
[01:02] <asgilder> How do I get into the command line?
[01:02] <bimberi> asgilder: Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
[01:02] <oem> ok so just something like/sda1 should work?
[01:02] <Dragen> asglider, you can hit ALT-F2 and type "gnome-terminal"
[01:02] <soundray> pibarnas: you could try to trace the error and recover, but unless you've customized your system a lot, reinstallation is faster.
[01:02] <BackPacker> oem: you'll also want to put a # at the start of the line in pmount.allow so that pmount doesn't handle it
[01:02] <Rprp> Well, nl.archive.ubuntu.com is down?
[01:02] <BackPacker> oem: not just like that it won't. you need to create a directory where you want to mount it
[01:02] <mariano> asgilder: Applications-> Accessories, no?
[01:03] <BackPacker> oem: you already created the /mnt/breezy directory earlier. You could mount it there
[01:03] <pibarnas> <soundray> I understand... thank you!
[01:03] <oem> so home/oem/desktop is workabnle?
[01:03] <BSDnux> does anyone know how to find out what channels the mixer supports? i doN't get any sound in tvtime and it seems to be a problem with the line-in settings, when i select "line" as the input source in xfce4-mixer, it always jumps back to "mic"...
[01:03] <oem> when you say to put the # you mean inside the pmount file?
[01:03] <con-man> does anyone know why my displays settings keep resseting when i log in
[01:03] <BackPacker> oem: /home/oem/desktop is not a good place to mount anything!
[01:04] <oem> /mnt/sda then?
[01:04] <BackPacker> oem: edit pmount.allow and add a # at the start of the line for sda1
[01:04] <BackPacker> oem: /mnt/sda isn't a good name but /mnt/sda1 could be
[01:04] <Dragen> no, mkdir in /mnt and call it whatever you want,  like /mnt/myfiles
[01:04] <con-man> anyone?
[01:04] <con-man> does anyone know why my displays settings keep resseting when i log in
[01:04] <oem> ha meant that
[01:04] <BackPacker> oem: of course, you'd have to create the /mnt/sda1 directory
[01:05] <BackPacker> oem: with "mkdir /mnt/sda1"
[01:05] <soundray> con-man: I think this might be because it applies your personal setting from the Screen Resolution dialog.
[01:05] <oem> sould the breezy would work to use?
[01:05] <BackPacker> oem: but I'd suggest giving it a better name than that, like /mnt/breezy. Which you've already created
[01:05] <con-man> kk
[01:05] <asgilder> When I get into sudo fdisk it asks for a password, but won't let me type one.
[01:05] <Dragen> asglider, use your login password
[01:05] <tonyyarusso> asgilder: It won't show the characters, but it is taking the input
[01:05] <oem> cool, I'm learning alot
[01:05] <ezenu> oem, I'd recommend something descriptive. e.g., /mnt/data, /mnt/win, /mnt/share -- these are what I use. The /dev/x is different
[01:06] <BackPacker> oem: so the line in /etc/fstab would look like this: /dev/sda1       /mnt/breezy               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
[01:06] <soundray> asgilder: it will let you type it - it just doesn't echo the keystrokes.
[01:06] <rb__> in #nlnog
[01:06] <ezenu> oem, but it doesn't really matter
[01:06] <oem> yep thats what I have it looking like now
[01:06] <BackPacker> ezenu: it's his old Breezy  partitions, so I suggested /mnt/breezy
[01:06] <oem> only have to save everything and  reboot or no?
[01:06] <maxxism> surprising.  my upgrade from dapper to edgy worked without any problems that i can see.
[01:07] <BackPacker> oem: have you edited pmount.allow?
[01:07] <oem> yes
[01:07] <ezenu> BackPacker, oh ok. I was thinking that /mnt/sda1 was an obscure title
[01:07] <soundray> maxxism: it's done so for thousands of users who we don't get to see here ;)
[01:07] <BackPacker> oem: you don't have to reboot yet. Remember, it's already mounted in /mnt/breezy. You did that earlier.
[01:07] <oem> but it doesn't seem to want to let me save anyof this
[01:07] <oem> ah
[01:07] <BackPacker> oem: next time you boot it should work
[01:08] <kelvie> I just finished doing a dist-upgrade from Dapper to Edgy, and it complains about libuim0 not letting libuim3 install
[01:08] <BackPacker> oem: you need to be root to edit those files
[01:08] <kelvie> and as such, all apt-gets fail at the dep check
[01:08] <asgilder> Okay... how to mount?
[01:08] <BackPacker> oem: what did you edit them in? Which program?
[01:08] <kelvie> How do I fix that?
[01:08] <oem> gedit
[01:08] <BackPacker> oem: you're running Gnome desktop?
[01:08] <oem> but I opened them with filebrowser not in terminal
[01:08] <oem> yes
[01:08] <toodles> im sure this has been asked many times but im debating what to install i have a celeron 466mhz laptop with a 6gig hdd and 256megs of ram what should i be installing:) would kubuntu run to slow?
[01:09] <Dragen> oem you didn't sudo the file
[01:09] <BackPacker> oem: I use KDE. Do you have a terminal open?
[01:09] <maxxism> soundray  I have just heard so many people with issues.
[01:09] <toodles> i have xp on it now so anything really faster and smoother would be nice:)
[01:09] <oem> yep
[01:09] <BackPacker> oem: enter "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" and edit that one
[01:09] <soundray> maxxism: that's what I'm saying: you don't hear from the people who don't have issues.
[01:09] <tonyyarusso> toodles: It would be doable, but maybe not the most pleasant with Kubuntu.  I'd try Xubuntu, which is pretty sweet these days.
[01:09] <BackPacker> oem: and do "sudo gedit /etc/pmount.allow"
[01:09] <mon_> is there a way to force reloading the groups a user's in? (may sound a bit weird..)
[01:10] <maxxism> soundray true true.
[01:10] <oem> let me guess save what I have as fstab1 then open in sudo terminal and then save as fstab
[01:10] <BackPacker> oem: make the changes and save, then close the other gedit window(s)
[01:10] <mon_> except relogin
[01:10] <maxxism> ahhhh firefox 2 is nice
[01:10] <sindrum> you could use ubuntu on the laptop...i installed breezy on a crappier box and it ran ok
[01:10] <Dragen> oem, make sure you don't close the terminal window, behind gedit, cuz this will close the thread
[01:10] <soundray> kelvie: try a 'sudo apt-get --purge remove libuim0'. It shouldn't be needed any more.
[01:10] <toodles> tonyyarusso: and with xubuntu with ease i can browse the net, irc, play mp3s, email and whatnot?
[01:11] <BackPacker> oem: better to do "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" and copy and paste the line from the original gedit window
[01:11] <toodles> i mean if ubuntu or kubuntu would run faster and smoother then xp is running on the laptop now i would be happy:)
[01:11] <BackPacker> oem: then do "sudo gedit pmount.allow" and put the # at the start of the sda1 line
[01:11] <tonyyarusso> toodles: Sure.  Take a look around the screenshots on osdir.com if you want to check it out ahead of time.  You can actually have both Xubuntu and Kubuntu at the same time and see which you prefer.
[01:11] <asgilder> Can I mount a fat32 drive in Ubuntu?
[01:11] <sindrum> it depends on how your going to use it
[01:11] <Dragen> toodles, i'm running Nvidia/Beryl and it runs better than Vista  ;)
[01:12] <soundray> !fat32 | asgilder
[01:12] <ubotu> asgilder: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[01:12] <BackPacker> asgilder: yes, you can
[01:12] <toodles> hmmm
[01:12] <toodles> oh the decisions:) i only have 1 blank cd so i need to figure out which 1 to burn:)
[01:12] <oem> ok all done
[01:12] <Dragen> toodles, between ubuntu and kubuntu?
[01:12] <toodles> kubuntu just looks so pleasing haha
[01:12] <BackPacker> oem: great
[01:12] <kelvie> soundray: did that, it didn't work
[01:12] <toodles> i dunno
[01:13] <soundray> !doesn't work | kelvie
[01:13] <ubotu> kelvie: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[01:13] <toodles> i jsut want something that will run better then xp on this lappy
[01:13] <kelvie> soundray: but I think I fixed it.. I just removed all the uim-related packages at once
[01:13] <tonyyarusso> toodles: Burn a minimal and install from there ;)  (well, if you want)
[01:13] <kelvie> :/
[01:13] <toodles> tony as in installing ubuntu server then install from there?
[01:13] <Dragen> toodles, i know i'm gonna get beat up for saying this in the ubuntu channel, but I like Kubuntu better  ;)
[01:14] <toodles> dragen but are u running kubuntu on a shitty computer?
[01:14] <BackPacker> Dragen: seconded :-)
[01:14] <Dragen> haha, nah it's a Dell Precision M90
[01:14] <sindrum> im just the opposite, i prefer ubuntu
[01:14] <toodles> from what ive read kubuntu seems less laggy then ubuntu due to the gnome or some shit
[01:14] <tonyyarusso> toodles: It's one way.  The only advantage is if you install two from there and use aptitude instead of apt-get it's easier to remove one to save disk space later.
[01:14] <Dragen> felt really limited by Gnome
[01:14] <BackPacker> soundray: oh, no, not the two-by-four :-)
[01:14] <Dragen> I will say (personally) i noticed my 3d desktop cube / Beryl ran faster in Kubuntu
[01:15] <badgerman> Hi everyone
[01:15] <toodles> well this question may make it easier will kubuntu and ubuntu both run faster then xp is running on the machine?
[01:15] <BackPacker> toodles: I'm running Kubuntu on a 1.2 MHz box, if that's useful information...
[01:15] <sean_micken|work> i just upgraded a system from dapper to edgy.  is the start up supposed to be so bare now?  i don't see any output of things starting....?
[01:15] <toodles> back that is faster then what i have:)
[01:15] <Dragen> lol soundray
[01:15] <toodles> 466mhz celeron 256megs of ram laptop is what i have
[01:15] <IdleOne> funny thing happening.. when I enter sudo apt-get whatever Im not being asked for my password. anybody know why that is?
[01:16] <FirstStrike> holy slow laptop batman
[01:16] <toodles> hahah yeah
[01:16] <BackPacker> toodles: Xubuntu would run a tad faster than Kubuntu then :-)
[01:16] <toodles> well as i said im just looking for something quicker then xp
[01:16] <Dragen> haha
[01:16] <toodles> so if kubuntu would be id rather just run that
[01:16] <FirstStrike> toodles: xubuntu is your ticket
[01:16] <toodles> im already used to xp on it for the past 2 years
[01:16] <sindrum> floppy linux will run good on it
[01:16] <BackPacker> IdleOne: have you changed /etc/sudoers by any chance?
[01:16] <soundray> IdleOne: it only asks for your password if you haven't used sudo in the past 15 minutes
[01:16] <iStirk> For some reason, when I try to install Ubuntu I get an "Unable to start in graphics mode" error. Any ideas what could be causing this? I have an nVidia Geforce 6800 graphics card.
[01:16] <FirstStrike> kubuntu is too resource heavy for that laptop
[01:16] <toodles> sindrum i want gui:)
[01:16] <FirstStrike> !xubuntu
[01:16] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[01:17] <toodles> how about ubuntu then/
[01:17] <oem> ok still having a problem
[01:17] <Dragen> toodles, really the only difference between the two is Gnome/KDE.  in fact, you can run BOTH if you want and choose your session.  your packages are just a little more cluttered
[01:17] <IdleOne> BackPacker,  no and soundray  I just rebooted machine so it should ask right?
[01:17] <sindrum> right right...just make sure everything is compatible first
[01:17] <max_> how do you change your nick?
[01:17] <FirstStrike> toodles: both gnome/kde are too graphic heavy imo for that laptop. xubuntu is much more light weight and should run best.
[01:17] <sindrum> iv ran into problems with some older stuff...bios or something
[01:17] <FirstStrike> max_: /nick newnickhere
[01:17] <BackPacker> IdleOne: and you haven't logged in as root... :-)
[01:17] <oem> its still won't let me modify the partition
[01:17] <IdleOne> max_,  /nick newnick
[01:17] <con-man> does anyone here know how to remove all my display preferences from my account.
[01:17] <IdleOne> BackPacker,  nope
[01:18] <max_> thanks
[01:18] <IdleOne> no problem
[01:18] <soundray> IdleOne: I'm not sure. I think the timestamp matters, not whether you've rebooted.
[01:18] <BackPacker> oem: do this in a terminal: ls -ld /mnt/breezy
[01:18] <bimberi> toodles: i have a desktop with the same specs.  Xubuntu would be a good choice (I've tried all 3 on it)
[01:18] <toodles> hrm well im not looking for "the best" im looking for whats better then xp i do like looking at a nice desktop to since i have to stare at it the whole time im using the computer id like it to look good as well
[01:18] <IdleOne> BackPacker,  and soundray  I'll wait fifteen and see
[01:18] <IdleOne> thanks
[01:18] <con-man> does anyone know how I can remove my display prefs from my acount. ive got stuff that is set up in xorg.conf that seems to be overridden when i log in
[01:18] <FirstStrike> toodles: you can customize the gui anyway you want.
[01:18] <toodles> the ss of xubuntu look like win95:)
[01:18] <Dragen> Kubuntu feels a little more like windows.  so if that's what you're comfortable with, go with that.
[01:19] <grexk> helloo everyone, how can I downgrade amd64 to x86 w/out reinstallation?
[01:19] <oem> I got :drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 2006-11-03 23:32 /mnt/breezy
[01:19] <toodles> dragen do u think it would run better then xp on that machine?
[01:19] <soundray> con-man: I suggest you first test the theory and create a new user, see if it happens there, too.
[01:19] <iStirk> For some reason, when I try to install Ubuntu I get an "Unable to start in graphics mode" error. Any ideas what could be causing this? I have an nVidia Geforce 6800 graphics card.
[01:19] <BackPacker> Dragen: if Kubuntu felt like Windows, I'd jump out of mine
[01:19] <con-man> soundray: good idea
[01:19] <BackPacker> oem: wait one, please. I need a nature break...
[01:19] <Dragen> toodles, I think Linux runs better period lol.. but the only difference between them is the Desktop Environment..
[01:19] <soundray> IdleOne: could try 'sudo -k' as well
[01:19] <IdleOne> toodles,  xubuntu will definately run faster then XP
[01:19] <Dragen> YOU pick what window managers you want to use
[01:19] <ozoneco> where are the man files at?
[01:19] <oem> no worries you've been to helpful
[01:19] <IdleOne> soundray,  -k?
[01:19] <Dragen> Xubuntu is really stripped down to run fast, if that's what you're looking for
[01:19] <toodles> is there any ss besides the xubuntu site with some sample desktops?
[01:20] <soundray> con-man: also, have you looked at the options that 'System-Preferences-Screen Resolution' gives you?
[01:20] <toodles> all the laptop is for is playing mp3s, browsing the net, irc, email
[01:20] <soundray> IdleOne: invalidates the users timestamp
[01:20] <Skrot> Hi. Can the ffmpeg version that comes with ubuntu encode video to h264?
[01:20] <keegan_> Hello everyone,  I followed the instructions on the Beryl wiki on how to install it on my Edgy Eft system.  The problem is when I start beryl borders come up around my applications and I can't move them.  I have a GeForce 5200 with the Nvidia drivers from the edgy repo.  Anyone know how to fix this problem?
[01:20] <scrupul0us> im having issues with mysql on a fresh install of edgy.. when i added new users via phpmyadmin they cant login... the ONLY account that CAN login is root... not even the account i made during install... please help
[01:20] <soundray> IdleOne: 'man sudo' -- magic
[01:20] <toodles> but i dont wanna install xubuntu and spend the next 2 days installing other crap to get it running:)
[01:20] <keegan_> borders don't come up...sorry
[01:20] <Dragen> keegan, are you starting up with 'beryl-manager'
[01:20] <keegan_> Yes I am.
[01:20] <IdleOne> soundray,  ok got it . I had just added some new aliases to .bashrc and thought perhaps that did it
[01:21] <Dragen> ok you need to add an entry to your xorg.conf file..
[01:21] <FirstStrike> toodles: it's lightweight, not featureless
[01:21] <soundray> Skrot: I think it can, but I would try mencoder first
[01:21] <keegan_> Do you know where I could find that entry?
[01:21] <Dragen> getting it...
[01:21] <keegan_> Thanks man
[01:21] <ziff> im looking for a cms system with a good forum to use, ive tryed phpnuke but people says its insecure
[01:21] <toodles> is there a way if i installed xubuntu and wanted to end up on kubuntu off the xubuntu install
[01:21] <asgilder> There are no files in my fat32 partition! The folders are there, but files aren't.
[01:21] <mcphail> scrupul0us: mysql users are not the same as your system's users...
[01:21] <bimberi> toodles: it installed and ran fine on my desktop.  I did use the alternate CD to install though - the Desktop CD wouldn't boot
[01:22] <FirstStrike> ziff: I like SMF (Simple Machine Forum)
[01:22] <Dragen> keegan, under your DEVICE and SCREEN sections, make sure you have this:  Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
[01:22] <soundray> ziff: perhaps you'll like zope
[01:22] <BackPacker> oem: how are you trying to access it?
[01:22] <soundray> !zope | ziff
[01:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about zope - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:22] <bimberi> toodles: yes, you can install kubuntu-desktop
[01:22] <scrupul0us> mcphail.. right... but im not talking system.. im talking mysql
[01:22] <FirstStrike> It's easy to use, has a good community backing and a very nice built-in update feature.
[01:22] <Dragen> keegan, the path is  /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:22] <keegan_> whats the path to the xserver config file?
[01:22] <soundray> !zope-common | ziff
[01:22] <BackPacker> oem: what I mean is, how are you trying to modify it?
[01:22] <ubotu> zope-common: common settings and scripts for zope installations. In component main, is optional. Version 0.5.24 (edgy), package size 37 kB, installed size 232 kB
[01:22] <bimberi> toodles: which will be a large download though
[01:22] <BackPacker> oem: and what error message do you get?
[01:22] <toodles> oh
[01:22] <soundray> arrgh
[01:22] <oem> I am using the file browser with super user access through Konqueror
[01:22] <maxxism> !man
[01:22] <ubotu> The "man" command brings up the Linux manual pages for the command you're interested in. Try "man intro" at the command line, or see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[01:22] <scrupul0us> mcphail: i added new users underphpmyadmin.. and they cant login via phpmyadmin
[01:23] <con-man> soundray: i made a new account, and the issue doesnt happen in the new account
[01:23] <maxxism> uboto rocks
[01:23] <oem> it just tells me I don't have permission, only the owner of the file can
[01:23] <BackPacker> oem:  and how are you trying to modify it?
[01:23] <toodles> cuz i only have 1 cd so i figured if i could burn and install xubuntu then move to ubuntu then if that still runs fast move to kubuntu:)
[01:23] <Dragen> keegan, are you using nvidia?
[01:23] <soundray> con-man: excellent, give me a minute to try something...
[01:23] <oem> I tried deleting, opening
[01:23] <BackPacker> oem: so the perms on that file are wrong.
[01:23] <bimberi> toodles: sounds like a plan :)
[01:23] <oem> and writing
[01:23] <BackPacker> oem: I notice that /mnt/breezy is owned by root
[01:24] <con-man> soundray: k
[01:24] <oem> yes
[01:24] <toodles> 6.10, codename Edgy Eft (stable release)
[01:24] <toodles> 6.06.1, codename Dapper Drake (stable release), with Long Term Support
[01:24] <BackPacker> oem: we need to find out the perms and ownership of that file
[01:24] <toodles> which 1 do i want?
[01:24] <oem> but the files I am trying to access are the old root user but with the name zachary
[01:24] <oem> I just don't know how to access them as zachary@ubuntu
[01:24] <mcphail> scrupul0us: and the users you added have priveleges on localhost?
[01:25] <BackPacker> oem: I recognise the problem. your user name and id don't match the ones you had in Breezy
[01:25] <scrupul0us> yes and the FQDN
[01:25] <oem> well I do have another id on here as zachary but i have not tried using that one as its not the root
[01:25] <scrupul0us> mcphail: i event went so low as %
[01:25] <BackPacker> oem: doesn't matter. zachary might have been root on Breezy, but on Dapper he's plain old zachary
[01:26] <oem> should i try logging in as zachary on this distro and then access the old breezy
[01:26] <oem> ah
[01:26] <Hoag> Hey. Is it possible to choose the title of a window when opening it? I'm using gnome.
[01:26] <bimberi> toodles: Edgy - if you want your software more up-to-date.  Dapper - if stability/dependability is vital to you (although Edgy is quite stable to be fair).
[01:26] <FirstStrike> toodles: dapper has LTS (long term support) and is more stable than edgy. edgy is 'bleeding edge' and has a lot of the newest software, thus is prone to more problems.
[01:26] <BackPacker> oem: yes. That should do it
[01:26] <killermach_> where do I configure xorg? I think there may be a graphics driver problem with the default install on my laptop
[01:26] <Dragen> killermach_: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:26] <toodles> hrmm
[01:26] <mcphail> scrupul0us: and you flushed the priveleges?
[01:26] <BackPacker> oem: a more permanent solution should also be possible
[01:26] <scrupul0us> mcphail: yessir
[01:26] <keegan_> Dragen: Section "Screen"
[01:26] <keegan_> 	Identifier	"Default Screen"
[01:26] <keegan_> 	Device		"NVIDIA Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5200] "
[01:26] <keegan_> 	Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
[01:26] <keegan_> like that?
[01:26] <Dragen> yep
[01:27] <keegan_> Still didn't work :(
[01:27] <scrupul0us> mcphail: i even reloaded mysql
[01:27] <keegan_> Do I need to reset my xserver for it to take effect?
[01:27] <Dragen> yea beryl can be finicky...
[01:27] <IdleOne> why do I still have the kubuntu login box if I removed kubuntu-desktop?
[01:27] <toodles> so which do u guys recommend dapper or edgy?
[01:27] <Dragen> you can try doing ALT-CTRL-BACKSPACE
[01:27] <IdleOne> dapper
[01:27] <keegan_> alright I'll be right back then
[01:27] <scrupul0us> mcphail: /etc/init.d/mysql restart
[01:27] <FirstStrike> toodles: dapper
[01:27] <soundray> con-man: when you're logged in as the new user, try this: 'su - conman', followed by 'rm ./.gconf/desktop/gnome/screen/default/0/*' (assuming your old username is conman).
[01:27] <FirstStrike> but it comes down to personal preference
[01:27] <oem> Backpacker you are me own personal hereo
[01:27] <killermach_> Dragen: is there a GUI within ubuntu? I was hoping for a drop selection list of video card drivers
[01:27] <oem> or hero
[01:28] <mcphail> scrupul0us: what error do you get if you try to log in via command line client?
[01:28] <FirstStrike> killermach_: No
[01:28] <BackPacker> oem: it worked then?
[01:28] <Dragen> yea, there is a utility you can get that does that...
[01:28] <FirstStrike> xorg.conf is the best way
[01:28] <Dragen> but make sure in xorg.conf that your device is set to 'nvida'
[01:28] <oem> one last thing I guess then, how do I give root priveldges to the zachary id
[01:28] <oem> yep
[01:28] <soundray> con-man: if that doesn't work, you'll have to log in at the console (Ctrl-Alt-F1), then run the rm command, then switch back to X with Alt-F7, then log in normally
[01:28] <Dragen> woops, 'nvidia'
[01:28] <toodles> theres no way i can install it from windows xp is there? i have to burn it and reboot to install right? i cant use a virtual drive and mount for an install?
[01:28] <Dragen> and NOT 'nv'
[01:28] <oem> like a charm
[01:29] <BackPacker> oem: you can add zachary to the admin group. Check out "Users and Groups" in the System menu
[01:29] <IdleOne> toodles,  cd's a cheap enough
[01:29] <killermach_> Dragen: my default installation on my laptop with ATI Radeon mobile, some X buttons get verticle pixel lines on them, when I mouse over them, they clear up and remain clear on mouse out
[01:29] <bimberi> toodles: as an example of the difference, Edgy has Firefox 2.0.  Dapper has 1.5.
[01:29] <BackPacker> oem: but that doesn't give zachary full root privileges
[01:29] <scrupul0us> mcphail: may i message you
[01:29] <toodles> bumberi aww ok
[01:29] <Hoag> Anyone?
[01:29] <toodles> well im gonna try edgy
[01:29] <oem> but I can at least add and remove programs right?
[01:29] <Dragen> killermach_: hmm that's odd.. have ou tried reloading your theme?
[01:29] <BackPacker> oem: yes
[01:29] <mcphail> scrupul0us: if you keep it in channel then anyone can help or learn. I'm no mysql guru :)
[01:29] <Dragen> keegan_: how did that work out?  still no titlebars?
[01:29] <FirstStrike> toodles: why would you want to install it from within xp? the install cd is a livecd by default and will bring you into ubuntu. you can play with it without even installing it. then, when you're ready to install there's an "Install" icon on the desktop that will walk you through the install process. It's quite easy.
[01:30] <toodles> i hope getting my wireless card working on this wont be hard:) lol
[01:30] <oem> ok good that solves the last of my troubles
[01:30] <keegan_> Dragen: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35344/
[01:30] <keegan_> Thats the error I get
[01:30] <scrupul0us> mcphail: mysql -u blog -p
[01:30] <BackPacker> oem: you can do that anyway with "sudo apt-get install packagename" at the command line if you want to go all geeky
[01:30] <scrupul0us> mcphail: ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'blog'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
[01:30] <toodles> firststrike i can use the linux straight off the cd without installing it 1st to see if i like it?
[01:30] <FirstStrike> toodles: yes
[01:30] <vertz> how do i change from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1?
[01:30] <oem> ha well I willwrite that down as I do like to get my geek on
[01:30] <IdleOne> toodles,  yup :)
[01:30] <toodles> oh then ill just get all 3 versions mount it virtually
[01:30] <toodles> and see which i like the best that way
[01:31] <Dragen> keegan_: eek.. did you install the nvidia linux drivers?
[01:31] <BackPacker> oem: and that's not the last of your troubles, I bet... :-)
[01:31] <FirstStrike> toodles: it will run a little slower though because it's running off the cd
[01:31] <toodles> then burn the cd
[01:31] <toodles> yeah
[01:31] <FirstStrike> but other than that, it will be the same
[01:31] <toodles> but i can get the idea
[01:31] <oem> well for now it is
[01:31] <scrupul0us> mcphail: here is copy/paste from phpmyadmin... "blog  	localhost  	Yes  	 ALL PRIVILEGES  "
[01:31] <con-man> soundray: didnt work
[01:31] <BackPacker> oem: good
[01:31] <keegan_> I believe I did, I installed them from the repository...I had to install a new kernel and all that stuff
[01:31] <soundray> con-man: what did it say?
[01:31] <oem> thank you again and hope i can help pyou out someday
[01:31] <Fastly> i'm trying to share files using samba and the "System->Administration->Shared Folders" dialog..
[01:31] <scrupul0us> mcphail: thats the privledges tab
[01:31] <con-man> soundray: i removed the directory
[01:31] <BackPacker> oem: you're welcome. Glad to be of help
[01:32] <Dragen> i could never get it to work from the repository.. i downloaded my nvidia drivers manually...
[01:32] <oem> well I'm off to reacquint myself with old data
[01:32] <con-man> soundray: it went fine. but when i logged back in, same issue. display settings are overriding whats in xorg.conf
[01:32] <Dragen> got them installed..
[01:32] <soundray> con-man: did you log out as your old user before you did this?
[01:32] <bimberi> toodles: they're LiveCD's you have to boot from them to evaluate.  I'm not sure you can do that from an ISO image on a HDD
[01:32] <con-man> soundray: yes
[01:32] <Fastly> but on windows it asks for a password for "ARNIE\alex"... i type in my password (alex on machine called arnie) and it doesn't work
[01:32] <IdleOne> why do I still have the kubuntu login box if I removed kubuntu-desktop?
[01:32] <BackPacker> oem: see you around
[01:32] <keegan_> Alright I'll do that then try it again
[01:32] <Dragen> keegan...
[01:32] <Dragen> when you try to load beryl, can you hold down ALT , click the window and wiggle the window around?
[01:32] <genbie> hi, anyone knows how can i find out if i have usb 1.0 or usb 2.0 from /proc/bus/usb please?
[01:32] <soundray> IdleOne: kubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage. It doesn't actually remove anything.
[01:32] <asgilder> Can someone help me? I mounted my windows partition, and got that working. I can access it now. But there are no files there. There are just empty folders.
[01:32] <nobotz> is it normal to have no /etc/postgresql/8.1/main missing in dapper
[01:33] <keegan_> none of the windows move
[01:33] <Fastly> any ideas please?
[01:33] <bimberi> toodles: that said, this looks promising - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows
[01:33] <killermach_> Dragen: no.. still d/l'ing updates.. I'll try changing theme when done
[01:33] <soundray> con-man: okay, two suggestions.
[01:33] <IdleOne> soundray, what package do I remove to get the kubuntu login off and use ubuntu default one
[01:33] <soundray> con-man: actually, let's start with just one.
[01:33] <con-man> soundray: there has to be a way to remove the personal display settings for the account con-man
[01:33] <toodles> thx bumberi im reading it now
[01:33] <IdleOne> soundray,  or do I need to switch from kde back to gdm?
[01:33] <Dragen> keegan_: ok...
[01:33] <Flannel> IdleOne: that's KDM vs GDM, not kubuntu vs ubuntu, yeah.
[01:33] <soundray> con-man: remove the entire directory '/home/con-man/.gconf/desktop/gnome/screen/'
[01:34] <Dragen> keegan_: when installing those nvidia linux drivers, you can get an API mismatch, and X wont start...
[01:34] <scrupul0us> mcphail: do mysql users have to be system users as well?
[01:34] <con-man> soundray: will try that
[01:34] <BackPacker> On boot, I get this message: "/dev/hda7: The filesystem size (according to the superblock) is 3933916 bocks. The physical size of the device is 3933909 blocks. Either the superblock or the partition is likely to be corrupt!" Anhone know how to fix it?
[01:34] <con-man> soundray: brb
[01:34] <IdleOne> Flannel,  refresh my memory on how I do that please
[01:34] <soundray> IdleOne: yes, the latter
[01:34] <scrupul0us> mcphail: caus this si crazy
[01:34] <jughead> how might I go about compiling a program from source?
[01:34] <soundray> !compile | jughead
[01:34] <ubotu> jughead: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[01:34] <Dragen> keegan_: are you running Ubuntu ?
[01:34] <keegan_> Yes I am 6.10
[01:34] <mcphail> scrupul0us: no - mysql users have nothing to do with system users
[01:35] <Flannel> IdleOne: dpkg-reconfigure gdm should do it
[01:35] <RememberPOL> Does anyone know a repository that keeps the latest beta nvidia binary drivers (1.0-9742, not just 1.0-9629) ?
[01:35] <scrupul0us> mcphail: thats what i thought.. but i cant for the life of me think why it doesnt work
[01:35] <soundray> jughead: what package do you need?
[01:35] <con-man> soundray: didnt work
[01:35] <Dragen> ok somewhere in System, utilties, i can't remember (i'm in Kubuntu)  nvidia usually installs a utility called "NVIDIA X Server Settings"... do you see that?
[01:35] <IdleOne> Flannel, Thank you
[01:35] <soundray> con-man: so you logged out fully, then removed the directory? With rm -rf ?
[01:36] <IdleOne> soundray,  TY ALSO
[01:36] <mcphail> scrupul0us: and logging in as "-u root" works?
[01:36] <con-man> soundray: yeah
[01:36] <scrupul0us> yes
[01:36] <scrupul0us> root works just fine
[01:36] <con-man> soundray: rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty ./.gconf/desktop/gnome/screen/
[01:36] <keegan_> No I don't see it anywhere in the start menu
[01:36] <scrupul0us> thats how i was adding new privledge users
[01:36] <vcef> where can I get ubuntu kernel patches?
[01:36] <RememberPOL> Dragen: Are you talking to me?
[01:36] <Dragen> keegan_: you don't see the NVINDIA splash just before X starts?
[01:36] <brett_> could anyone help me with beryl?
[01:36] <RememberPOL> keegan_: I believe the command is nvidia-settings
[01:36] <RememberPOL> brett_: What's up?
[01:36] <con-man> brett_: #beryl
[01:36] <mcphail> scrupul0us: i'll need to scratch my head about this one for a moment...
[01:36] <tonyyarusso> brett_: In #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl perhaps
[01:36] <Dragen> NVIDIA* llol
[01:37] <brett_> i've tried beryl, they aren't responding
[01:37] <soundray> con-man: any output from that command?
[01:37] <brett_> #beryl that is
[01:37] <BackPacker> Can anyone help with my partition size problem?
[01:37] <RememberPOL> brett_: What's the problem?
[01:37] <keegan_> nvidia settings loads up when I type in the command
[01:37] <con-man> soundray: none, just drops to the next line
[01:37] <keegan_> and no I haven't restarted since I installed the nvidia drivers
[01:37] <brett_> anyway, i had beryl running fine without updating "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg"
[01:37] <scrupul0us> mcphail: im righnt there with you
[01:38] <jellegant> hey, room.
[01:38] <brett_> and when i ran that, i set up my file for nvidia
[01:38] <Flannel> !kernel | vcef
[01:38] <ubotu> vcef: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[01:38] <keegan_> I got a couple of errors though when I loaded the nvidia-settings command though
[01:38] <killermach_> oh.. I have a dual boot, how do I get ubuntu to stop tampering with the system clock, I don't use UTC but don't find this option in the administration of time
[01:38] <brett_> i got my resolution to work, but now whenever i try to run beryl, the borders dissapear
[01:38] <RememberPOL> brett_: I believe that just alters your xorg.conf file, so it probably took out some card/aiglx settings you need.
[01:38] <soundray> con-man: perhaps you can copy the .gconf/desktop/gnome/screen directory over from the new user, if one exists
[01:38] <Dragen> ok there are a few tutorials on this, i'm kind of lost what steps you took
[01:38] <vcef> thanks
[01:38] <Dragen> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263851
[01:38] <Dragen> That is the thread for installing NVIDIA/AIGLX/BERYL
[01:38] <brett_> any idea how to replenish my card/aiglx settings?
[01:38] <Dragen> make sure you haven't missed anything
[01:38] <RememberPOL> brett_: Does the splashscreen show up?
[01:38] <keegan_> Alright I'll read it
[01:39] <tonyyarusso> killermach_: You set UTC="no" somewhere - give me a moment and I'll try to find the file
[01:39] <brett_> yes. nvidia flickers for a second, then shows my login screen
[01:39] <RememberPOL> brett_: I mean the Beryl splashscreen..
[01:39] <brett_> it shows up if i run beryl
[01:39] <con-man> good idea
[01:39] <brett_> but the borders dissapear
[01:39] <Dragen> brett_: run  'beryl-manager'
[01:39] <brett_> i can still alt+drag and have the windows move like jelly
[01:39] <toodles> the directions for installing ubuntu from windows seem a bit confusing lol
[01:40] <killermach_> tonyyarusso: thanks.. I did this once on another machine weeks ago, but this is my second unbuntu/xp install
[01:40] <jellegant> I have eft on my comp, but somehow lost my wireless.  I am currently running on my dapper live cd.  Does anyone know of any way to apt-get to the hd?
[01:40] <soundray> con-man: you'll have to go via sudo, i.e. 'sudo cp -a /home/newuser/.gconf/desktop/gnome/screen /tmp ; chown con-man.con-man /tmp/screen ; cp -a /tmp/screen /home/con-man/.gconf/desktop/gnome/
[01:40] <mcphail> scrupul0us: before we go any further (and sorry to ask this...), you're sure you have the passwords correct (including case etc)?
[01:40] <soundray> '
[01:40] <brett_> dragen ive tried that
[01:40] <brett_> i have it run beryl-manager on boot
[01:40] <Dragen> ok have you added that option in your xorg.conf file?
[01:40] <RememberPOL> brett_: What's this return glxinfo | grep rendering
[01:40] <scrupul0us> mcphail: yes i just reset them on the one users ive been trying to add... twice... no go
[01:40] <scrupul0us> mcphail: simple test/test
[01:40] <brett_> Direct rendering: Yes
[01:41] <Dragen> ok that's good
[01:41] <brett_> brb
[01:41] <brett_> can you PM me?
[01:41] <soundray> con-man: forgot ' -R' after chmod
[01:41] <rance> does anyone know a good location for a howto on using ubuntu-server 6.06 as a NAT enabled internet sharing router
[01:41] <user123> Question can i install google earth on ubuntu ppc?
[01:41] <jughead> I'm trying to follow the directions for compiling the source, I keep getting ./configure:  no such file or directory
[01:41] <Dragen> brett_: , add this to your Screen and Device sections in /etc/X11/xorg.conf :   Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
[01:42] <Flannel> jughead: are you in the folder with the source?
[01:42] <dsnyders> I want to install Ubuntu onto LVM partitions, but that option doesn't seem to exist in the installer.  How do I install to LVM?
[01:42] <soundray> con-man: and sudo ('sudo chmod -R /tmp/screen')
[01:42] <jughead> Flannel, yeah

[01:42] <soundray> LordMetroid: which dictionary?
[01:42] <dsnyders> Flannel, Alternate CD?
[01:43] <Flannel> dsnyders: yeah, the alternate CD.  When you download the ISO, you have the choice between Desktop, and Alternate.  Alternate CD has LVM support
[01:43] <LordMetroid> It is contantly present in firefox at least...
[01:43] <LordMetroid> Maybe it's firefox's dictionary
[01:44] <soundray> LordMetroid: can you specify what you mean by 'it is present'?
[01:44] <LordMetroid> Well when I write messages in textbox I can use it for spelling
[01:44] <Spisters> Hello I have a question about drivers
[01:45] <mcphail> scrupul0us: yeah, i'm running squirrelmail. I set it up about 2 years ago though... :)
[01:45] <scrupul0us> mcphail: as i mentioned im on a fresh install of edgy... i have SM installed but it keeps telling me my imap server dropped the connection when i try to login
[01:46] <scrupul0us> mcphail: and i cannot find ANYTHING to help fix it
[01:46] <Spisters> how would I go about updating them in ubuntu?
[01:46] <mcphail> scrupul0us: i think you need to delete the old indexes
[01:47] <soundray> Spisters: which drivers?
[01:47] <scrupul0us> mcphail: old... its a fresh install... shouldnt be any old about it... never-thepless whats involved there
[01:47] <mcphail> scrupul0us: you are using it toi access mail on your own server?
[01:47] <Spisters> video card drivers
[01:47] <scrupul0us> mcphail: yes
[01:47] <francis_> how to share office file in a windows network using ubuntu?
[01:47] <Spisters> I tried going into device manager but that didn't really help
[01:47] <mcphail> scrupul0us: do you have any important mail stored yet? If so back it up first...

[01:48] <ubotu> francis_: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[01:48] <scrupul0us> mcphail: ive got nothing on there
[01:48] <mcphail> scrupul0us: i'm remembering this from a looong time ago...
[01:48] <BackPacker> francis_: you can use Samba to share Windows files
[01:48] <scrupul0us> mcphail: im configured like this: http://howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p5
[01:48] <mcphail> scrupul0us: in your Mail folder, try "rm -rf .imap/"
[01:48] <Flannel> scrupul0us: that's a really bad howto, by the way.
[01:48] <scrupul0us> mcphail: for post fix and courier
[01:48] <scrupul0us> o?
[01:48] <francis_> samba? how can i install it
[01:49] <soundray> BackPacker: no, Samba is for sharing files on Unix with a Windows network.
[01:49] <Flannel> francis_: read the URLs ubotu gave you in his factoid
[01:49] <scrupul0us> mcphail: why is that
[01:49] <BackPacker> soundray: that's what I meant. Didn't I?  :-)
[01:49] <francis_> im having problem installing files... i downloaded frostwire and YM for unix but i got an error
[01:50] <toodles> bumberi that guide seems to be fine until the end of it where it says reboot and it will boot of the cd doesnt say how it would work if u copy the iso to the hdd
[01:50] <mcphail> scrupul0us: it will delete the indexes which may be causing the connection to drop. Ihad this problem once and that fixed it
[01:50] <soundray> francis_: try 'cd /bin ; sudo ln -sf bash sh ; cd -' to fix those
[01:50] <mcphail> scrupul0us: but i'm afraid it is a "worksforme"
[01:50] <mattlowe> Can anyone tell me where i can find the sensor files for my cpu, hdd, etc temps? fan speeds and what not?
[01:50] <jughead> ok I made it part of the way through the configure process... it says I'm missing SDL
[01:50] <mcphail> scrupul0us: back the directory up first, if you're worried
[01:51] <francis_> thnks soundray
[01:51] <scrupul0us> ::scratches head:: i just did a localte .imap
[01:51] <scrupul0us> and found nothing
[01:51] <soundray> mattlowe: if your ACPI accesses them, and it is supported, you can look in /proc/acpi/
[01:51] <scrupul0us> mcphail: i mean locate
[01:51] <soundray> mattlowe: failing that, you can try the mbmon program
[01:51] <soundray> !info mbmon | mattlowe
[01:51] <ubotu> mbmon: Hardware monitoring without kernel dependencies (text client). In component universe, is optional. Version 2.05-4 (edgy), package size 65 kB, installed size 196 kB (Only available for i386 hurd-i386 amd64 kfreebsd-i386 knetbsd-i386)
[01:51] <francis_> soundray: where to execute the commands...dont know how to go to the command line? :)
[01:51] <RememberPOL> brett?
[01:52] <soundray> mattlowe: if you still haven't got what you want, and you're reasonably hardcore, you have to try lm-sensors.
[01:52] <mcphail> scrupul0us: i'm using dovecot as the server. Maybe that is the difference?
[01:52] <mattlowe> where do i get the lm-sensors?
[01:52] <soundray> !lm-sensors | mattlowe
[01:52] <ubotu> lm-sensors: utilities to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors. In component main, is extra. Version 1:2.10.0-7ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 479 kB, installed size 1472 kB
[01:52] <scrupul0us> mcphail: idk i tried that b4 as well...apt-get install dovecot.. still didnt work after i updated the squirrlmail-configure
[01:52] <dsnyders> Flannel, Is there a way of just downloading the LVM installer rather than the whole alternate CD?
[01:52] <CharlieSu> my ubuntu just quit being able to resolve any servernames..  if i have not updated anything what can i do so that it will reload resolv.conf?
[01:53] <rosen37> Please I manage a network and I installed a NIS server and I have 10 workstation on ubuntu connected on this NIS. On 1 machine , when a user log trhough the NIS , it works but when his comp lock (screensaver) he can t unlock it ( password incorrect ) . No idea what can be the prob?
[01:53] <soundray> francis_: open a terminal with Alt-F2 gnome-terminal
[01:53] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: you could restart networking
[01:53] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: i'm connected remotely, how can i do that so that it will startup without me there?
[01:53] <mattlowe> why are the lm-sensors "hardcore?"
[01:53] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: i'm SSHed in.. i need to make sure that it will be back up
[01:53] <mcphail> scrupul0us: what does "ls -a ~/Mail" reveal?
[01:54] <con-man> soundray: thanks it worked
[01:54] <soundray> con-man: the directory copy did?
[01:54] <mattlowe> i just did a apt-get install lm-sensors
[01:54] <francis_> soundray: it shows me the run application applet ..what to do next ?
[01:54] <scrupul0us> mcphail: ls: /root/Mail: No such file or directory
[01:54] <soundray> francis_: enter gnome-terminal
[01:55] <Spisters> why are the drivers on the linux-restricted-modules list, should I just be happy with what I have?
[01:55] <corevette> does anyone know how to install html tidy?
[01:55] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: the command "/etc/init.d/networking restart" would restart it, but I don't recommend it if you're not on the premises
[01:55] <mattlowe> soundtry - i did apt-get install mbmon along with lm-sensors
[01:55] <soundray> mattlowe: lm-sensors is the last choice. Please try the other options first.
[01:55] <soundray> mattlowe: you don't need lm-sensors for mbmon
[01:55] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: and the only way I know of to make sure it's back up is to be on the premises
[01:55] <mattlowe> how would i uninstall the lm-sensors then
[01:55] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yeah..  true..  damnit.. why won't anything resolve ?
[01:55] <mcphail> scrupul0us: do you have any mail directory in your user's home dir (not root)
[01:55] <soundray> mattlowe: leave it there for now, it won't interfere as you try out mbmon
[01:56] <francis_> soundray: ok got it! is the gnome terminal the command prompt..how to log in as root?
[01:56] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: i can't even ping yahoo.com
[01:56] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: what is a good place to look for errors?
[01:56] <Kervan> i cant find /etc/init.d/hpijs but i have installed hpijs where is my hpijs?
[01:56] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: can you ping localhost at least?
[01:56] <catalinux> where can I find ptrace cmd tool for ubuntu server?
[01:56] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yes
[01:56] <soundray> francis_: you don't need root. Just enter the commands. Wait, I'll repost...

[01:56] <ubotu> MythTV is a TV framework for Linux - Instructions for using with Ubuntu at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV
[01:56] <mattlowe> i ran mbmon and it said No Hardware Monitor Found!! InitMBInfo: Success
[01:56] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: by name as well as by IP:?
[01:56] <soundray> francis_: try 'cd /bin ; sudo ln -sf bash sh ; cd -' to fix those
[01:56] <scrupul0us> mcphail: i have one other users (my non-root account) and no.. theres no mail folder under its home dir
[01:56] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yes..
[01:56] <francis_> Soundray: ok thnks
[01:56] <soundray> mattlowe: try 'sudo mbmon'
[01:57] <mattlowe> i did
[01:57] <mattlowe> thats what it gave me
[01:57] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: and does your /etc/host.conf start with "order hosts, bind"
[01:57] <CharlieSu> yes
[01:57] <b0ss_> my names charlie to
[01:57] <b0ss_> how cool.
[01:57] <soundray> mattlowe: what do you get from 'ls /proc/acpi/fan'?
[01:57] <CharlieSu> b0ss_: lol
[01:57] <vcef> how do I run batch scheduled process?
[01:57] <b0ss_> cool
[01:58] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: can you ping other IPs on the network?
[01:58] <mcphail> scrupul0us: what error message do you get in /var/log/mail.err or /var/log/mail.log?
[01:58] <mattlowe> It doesnt return anything :(
[01:58] <soundray> vcef: what do you mean?
[01:58] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yes.. even IPs not on my network
[01:58] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: then if you can ping outside the network, what's not resolving?
[01:58] <soundray> mattlowe: how about 'ls /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/'?
[01:59] <AdamKili> i have a laptop that has a sticker on it: AMD Turion^64 Mobile Technology. Should I use 64-bit PC (AMD64) Ubuntu desktop CD? What happens if I use the x64 version? Haven
[01:59] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: Oh, I see, you can ping by IP but not by name?
[01:59] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yes
[01:59] <vcef> soundray: batch scheduling. I'm used to it from ck kernels and I've heard that it (or at least smth similar) went into mainline
[01:59] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: exactly
[01:59] <mattlowe> nothing either
[01:59] <vcef> I've installed schedtools but it doesn't seem to support it
[01:59] <faz99> Hi
[01:59] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: Can you ping other hosts on the network by name?
[01:59] <scrupul0us> mcphail: Dec  4 02:42:21 web postfix/smtpd[10496] : lost connection after CONNECT from localhost.localdomain[127.0.0.1] 
[01:59] <scrupul0us> Dec  4 02:42:21 web postfix/smtpd[10496] : disconnect from localhost.localdomain[127.0.0.1] 
[01:59] <soundray> AdamKili: install i386, unless you plan to do very heavy computation, such as video recoding
[01:59] <scrupul0us> thats a little snippet
[01:59] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: there are no other hosts to try at the moment
[01:59] <soundray> vcef: something like Condor does?
[01:59] <faz99> Can anyone help me with ubuntu?
[02:00] <vcef> what's Condor?
[02:00] <AdamKili> soundray: haven't people had problems with AMD hardware on linux?
[02:00] <francis_> what is samba and where can i get? need help how to install this one..
[02:00] <soundray> vcef: a batch/parallel execution scheduling system ;)
[02:00] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: And presumably you're trying to resolve Internet-based hosts, not just on another LAN?
[02:00] <vcef> never heard of it
[02:00] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yes..  like yahoo.com
[02:00] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: Is there the remotest possibility that your ISP's nameservers are down?
[02:00] <soundray> AdamKili: I use AMD hardware almost exclusively and have had plenty of problems, but never with the AMD hardware itself ;)
[02:01] <mattlowe> soundtry : that returned no results either
[02:01] <marco81> ciao  a tutit
[02:01] <vcef> I'm talking about special policy of kernel's process scheduler
[02:01] <soundray> mattlowe: okay, time to read the instructions in /usr/share/doc/lm-sensors/
[02:01] <fernando> hi all, somebody have kyocera kpc650 working on edgy?
[02:01] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: lol..  well i would hope not..  i'll SSH into another box and try.. hope i remember the IP
[02:01] <vcef> we have real time scheduling and we also have (ar at least should have) batch scheduling
[02:01] <con-man> soundray: no. turns out i never deleted the Screen directory to begin with
[02:01] <scrupul0us> mcphail: just now i tried again and got this:  Dec  4 20:01:13 web imapd: chdir Maildir: No such file or directory
[02:01] <mattlowe> read the readme?
[02:01] <francis_> can anyone help me about samba and how to install it? wher to find it guyz
[02:01] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: I presume you've checked /etc/resolv.conf and that it looks OK?
[02:01] <soundray> con-man: ah
[02:01] <faz99> Can someone help me with ubuntu regarding j2sdk... Thanks!
[02:02] <mcphail> scrupul0us: that's more like it...
[02:02] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: actually it might be my DSL modem...  darn thing..

[02:02] <faz99> Thanks
[02:02] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: ppp usually rewrites /etc/resolv.conf. Could that be it?
[02:02] <AdamKili> soundray: thanks
[02:02] <soundray> vcef: you will have understood by now that I'm not the expert you're looking for...
[02:02] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: or do DSL modems not use ppp?

[02:03] <scrupul0us> mcphail: in /etc/postfix/main.cf i have this set: home_mailbox = Maildir/
[02:03] <mcphail> scrupul0us: try making a Maildir directory in /root/ and under your user's home dir
[02:04] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: I'm not sure that would work even if 192.168.1.1 is your gateway device
[02:04] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: it has always been that and always worked..  my DSL doesn't require Username or pass
[02:04] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: why not?
[02:04] <francis_> ubotu is there a need to run a installer to install softwares in ubuntu... i tried to download frostwire and YM fo runix  but i got an error running it
[02:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is there a need to run a installer to install softwares in ubuntu... i tried to download frostwire and YM fo runix  but i got an error running it - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:04] <LjL> Ubotu, tell francis_ about bot | francis_, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:04] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: good question. I've never done it that way. I've always put my ISP's nameservers in resolv.conf on each machine
[02:05] <scrupul0us> mcphail: creating Maildir got me in... now i have an error in EVERY pane
[02:05] <soundray> BackPacker: that resolv.conf is fine if the router acts as a DNS-forwarder.
[02:05] <mcphail> scrupul0us: lol
[02:05] <Vodan> Is there a skype client that works for x64 linux?
[02:05] <soundray> Vodan: yes
[02:05] <soundray> Vodan: let me dig up a link for you...
[02:05] <mcphail> scrupul0us: what are the errors in the logs (pastebin them if more than one line)
[02:05] <BackPacker> soundray: assuming it does...
[02:06] <scrupul0us> mcphail: please hold while i create a laughable log file ;)
[02:06] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: i'd love to try but for some reason i can't even get to the web configuration of my DSL modem via links2 -g over SSH with X11 forwareded
[02:06] <scrupul0us> mcphail: actually there are NO errors in mail.log
[02:06] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: I'm not familar with links2. Is it an X-based version of links?
[02:07] <mcphail> scrupul0us: and mail.err?
[02:07] <tonyyarusso> BackPacker: It can be.  It has graphical and console modes.
[02:07] <scrupul0us> blnak
[02:07] <scrupul0us> *blank
[02:07] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yes.. when using -g mode
[02:07] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: have you tried it in console mode?
[02:07] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: i can't even do it in the non X version
[02:07] <mcphail> scrupul0us: so what error is squirrelmail giving now?
[02:07] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yeah..
[02:07] <soundray> Vodan: sorry, I can't find it. The crucial thing is, you need the 32bit libraries installed. Some good info is in http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1174435
[02:07] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: i think it might be totally screwed up or something
[02:07] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: and the router won't let you in?
[02:07] <killermach_> hmm.. in firefox, on Ubuntu 6.06, I enter the URL "about:config" and I get an XML parsing error reponse? what may be wrong? this is a fresh install from DVD

[02:09] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: that's OK. Glad you got it sorted
[02:09] <b0ss_> charlie su
[02:09] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: atleast i was looking in the right places..
[02:09] <gerasn> is it like waiting for more input
[02:09] <b0ss_> is your last name su
[02:09] <soundray> CharlieSu: before you bin it, check out whether it behaves better with OpenWrt installed
[02:09] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: one more quick question for you..
[02:10] <mcphail> scrupul0us: try logging into your non-root users account
[02:10] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: ?
[02:10] <scrupul0us> i did
[02:10] <scrupul0us> i ahvent tried root yet
[02:10] <iStirk> For some reason, when I try to install Ubuntu I get an "Unable to start in graphics mode" error. Any ideas what could be causing this? I have an nVidia Geforce 6800 graphics card.
[02:10] <gerasn> someon in bash land must know what im talking about?
[02:10] <Sionide> grr.. firefox is doing my head in, it's stopped remembering my sessions and i can't figure out why. if i go to reinstall it, is it gonna majorly screw everything up cos apt-get is asking to remove a bunch of other stuff along with it... :s
[02:10] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: does this look correct or is the first one not needed           127.0.1.1       charlie.phunki.charlie.phunki.com charlie.phunki.com
[02:10] <mcphail> scrupul0us: "ls -a /home/youruser/Maildir/"?
[02:10] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: in /etc/hosts that is..
[02:10] <scrupul0us> mcphail: but the errors are the same
[02:10] <scrupul0us> mcphail: is exists but its empty
[02:11] <soundray> gerasn: what context are you taking this line from?
[02:11] <gerasn> ok um
[02:11] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: Looks wrong to me. Unless your hostname is the first one
[02:11] <mcphail> scrupul0us: you installed squirrelmail and your mail server through apt-get?
[02:11] <scrupul0us> yes
[02:11] <gerasn> soundray: Backup an NTFS volume to a remote host, using ssh. Please note, that ssh may ask for a password!
[02:11] <gerasn> ntfsclone --save-image --output - /dev/hda1 | \\
[02:11] <gerasn> gzip -c | ssh host ?cat > backup.img.gz?
[02:11] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: I'd expect it to look like this: charlie.phunki.com charlie
[02:11] <scrupul0us> mcphail: apt-get install postfix libsasl2 sasl2-bin libsasl2-modules libdb3-util procmail
[02:12] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: yeah.. that is what i thought..  ubuntu did that when it installed
[02:12] <mcphail> scrupul0us: and squirrelmail?
[02:12] <scrupul0us> mcphail: apt-get install courier-authdaemon courier-base courier-imap courier-imap-ssl courier-pop courier-pop-ssl courier-ssl gamin libgamin0 libglib2.0-0
[02:12] <gerasn> soundray: i am not at a shell right now to try it
[02:12] <scrupul0us> mcphail: apt-get squirrelmail
[02:12] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: then hostname would look like what?
[02:12] <soundray> gerasn: I think the backslash got doubled by accident. What it means is that you should enter both parts in one line with no backslashes at all.
[02:13] <marco81> ciao

[02:13] <BackPacker> CharlieSu: Can't remember how it asks you for your hostname. Maybe you told it that charlie.phunki.com is the host name and charlie.phunki.com is the domain. That could get that result

[02:13] <CharlieSu> BackPacker: charlie.phunki.com

[02:45] <BackPacker> soundray: Thanks

[02:45] <Cyde> IdleOne: This'll be fun :-D

[02:46] <kitche> IdleOne: #ubuntu+1 that's for ubuntu dev releases or the next version of ubuntu that's not out yet
[02:46] <jrib> mordof: did you try what the restricted wiki suggested about using aoss?
[02:47] <mordof> jrib: for some reason ubuntu picked up 2 sound devices, only 1 works with my plugs
[02:47] <IdleOne> Cyde,  or keep hanging out here and ask ever so often and maybe someone will be able to help you
[02:47] <jrib> mordof: hmm so is this system wide?
[02:47] <IdleOne> kitche,  good to know :)
[02:47] <Cyde> IdleOne: I just found a much better doc from Gentoo, it seems like it should work here, I'll try it out.   http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_CVS_Server
[02:47] <mordof> jrib: yes
[02:47] <mordof> jrib: but most other apps figure it out
[02:47] <IdleOne> Cyde,  give it a shot
[02:47] <jrib> mordof: what apps aren't working?
[02:47] <mordof> jrib: flash :P
[02:47] <jrib> mordof: try aoss just to rule that out
[02:48] <mordof> jrib: alright, i looked through the page and didn't really see what you were tlakin about though.. i'll check again
[02:48] <kitche> Cyde: usually if you know how to translate gentoo docs to a certain distro they come in handy I usually look at gentoo docs all the time instead of the distro that I use
[02:48] <dmarkey> anyone here any experience with ubuntu on sparc?
[02:49] <jrib> mordof: yeah, I understand.  That page is pretty disorganized.  Just ctrl-f and search for "aoss".  It will take you to the right section

[02:49] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?

[02:50] <BackPacker> Last question of the day: Having installed all the media packages, the gxine plugin worked OK in Konqueror but not in Firefox. Before I could fix it I did a package upgrade that included Totem. Now the plugin doesn't work in either. And I didn't make notes about which packages were upgraded. Is there an easy way to get the plugin (or another plugin) working for streamed video?
[02:50] <Yashiro> i have problem with my 3D acceleration
[02:50] <Yashiro> i followed tons of guides, but never solved the problem
[02:51] <LjL> i still can't see the statement of a concrete problem
[02:51] <cpk1> BackPacker: the mplayer plugin?
[02:51] <BackPacker> cpk1: that would do. Mplayer and the plugin are installed, IIRC
[02:52] <cpk1> BackPacker: also for conquerer you need to tell it to look for new plugins after you get the plugin
[02:52] <cpk1> konquerer*
[02:52] <Yashiro> i just wanna make my ati x200m work fine, i don't know what is wrong, i installed fglrx used the aticonfig command but glxgears gimme 500 fps and i can't run beryl
[02:52] <kitche> Yashiro: do you have XGL installed?
[02:52] <LjL> Yashiro: glxgears is not a benchmark, and i believe you need XGL to run Beryl on ATI
[02:53] <Yashiro> i installed xgl
[02:53] <BackPacker> cpk1: apt-cache search shows mplayer and mencoder, plus kmplayer, but I don't know where the plugin is or what its name is
[02:53] <Yashiro> i installed xgl and compiz th first time, but it was so laggy with the effects

[02:54] <LjL> Yashiro: does "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep fgl" show anything at all?
[02:54] <cpk1> BackPacker: mozilla-mplayer
[02:54] <Yashiro> yup, tha aticonfig config

[02:57] <kitche> con-man: did you install wine with the wow patches?
[02:57] <con-man> kitche:perhaps
[02:57] <con-man> kitche:how can i tell
[02:58] <Smokeyyy> hi
[02:58] <kitche> con-man; think it's called wine-wow
[02:58] <con-man> kitche: in the repositories?
[02:59] <con-man> kitche: cause its not listed so you will need to link me a source
[02:59] <nagyv> could someone help me to set up ekiga? I have already registered for an ekiga account, but never used sip before, and I (and my partner too) feel myself lost. I have read about something like a sip proxy, what does it mean?

[03:00] <faz99> I have another question, I plugged in my USB drive but i dont know how to get to it at all...
[03:00] <LjL> Yashiro: don't see anything obviously wrong in there... anyway, for the record, my glxgears rates about 800 fps (nvidia 5200), so your 500 doesn't look that terrible to me. again, glxgears is far from a benchmark, it can just sometimes quickly tell you whether you have 3d acceleration enabled or not... i'd say you do
[03:00] <kitche> con-man it might say there how to run wow, but I know that wine needs patched to run it

Anyway, I got KDE to scan for new plugins, and set the file assocations in konqueror to Mplayer for just about all video types, but it's still trying to run xine when I click on video links on http://news.bbc.co.uk.

[03:07] <kitche> Cyde: there isn't an equivent to rc-update it's just how gentoo updates what boots at start
[03:07] <BackPacker> cpk1: Is there something else I need to do?

[03:09] <jvai> ooo, well i have probs mounting on dapper i do "sudo ehci-hcd" to unload the modules, but u have to do this aftr every reboot, cause they just load ... @ faz99
[03:09] <BackPacker> cpk1: it did that for me just after I first installed ubuntu. I selected wmp as I've got all the win32 codecs installed
[03:10] <jvai> do thatr in the terminal fazz99
[03:10] <faz99> Ill try it a sec thanks
[03:10] <anenigma83> is there an easy way to start wpa_supplicant _without_ using /etc/network/interfaces?  using 6.10, I want to run wpa_supplicant, then have ifplugd telling the dhclient to start when i'm associated, rather than starting dhclient and wpa_supplicant at the same time (roughly) from the interfaces file.  i have wpasupplicant installed and running ok, but there's no /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant script

[03:12] <jvai> faz99 did u sudo the command i gave?
[03:12] <faz99> yes
[03:12] <BackPacker> cpk1: I deleted the cookie containing that setting and it asked me again, so I selected WMP again, and clicking the link still brings up xine. Which doesn't play the video, it just shows a blank screen
[03:12] <Tonren> PoL: I don't think that's really the same... is it?  I mean, it doesn't really do anything in the way of machines, patterns or sequencing.
[03:12] <BackPacker> cpk1: problem is, I don't know which protocol they're using
[03:12] <Tonren> PoL: I guess it'd be like the MS Paint to Reason or GarageBand's Photoshop.
[03:13] <PoL> tur1: You probably need a script like at the bottom of the first post on this thread here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/baltix/+bug/15204
[03:13] <cpk1> BackPacker: xine works for me, but you can right click the blank box and tell it to use mplayer
[03:13] <matthew> hi all, is anyone not afk?
[03:13] <jvai> i dunno fazz99, i threw that out, from finding it on anothr forum , it worked for me.. i dont enough about edgy
[03:13] <Tonren> matthew: Best to just ask your question and see who answers.
[03:13] <PoL> Tonren: Yes, you listed professional commercial software, i listed a decent free software app.
[03:13] <AfterDeath> matthew: 'Don't ask to ask, just ask' ;)
[03:13] <faz99> hmmmmmmmmmmm
[03:14] <scrupul0us> whats prefered with edgy... postfix or sendmail?

[03:14] <qos> hey guys ...
[03:15] <Tonren> PoL: Well, like I said, Audacity is more like MS Paint.  GIMP is the open source alternative to Photoshop, so is there an open source alternative to any of those?
[03:15] <matthew> i have a question about compiling a program from source
[03:15] <cpk1> BackPacker: if i were you though i would be wondering why xine doesnt work =)
[03:15] <salle[] > uhm, is there any way to restart the installation (of 6.10) if i closed down the install to hard drive due to not doing anything for 30 minutes?
[03:15] <scrupul0us> matthew: just ask
[03:15] <bimberi> scrupul0us: postfix is in Ubuntu's main repository (sendmail is in universe)
[03:15] <scrupul0us> bimberi: but is one prefered over the other?
[03:15] <CarlFK> how can I tell if a usb port is usb1 or 2?
[03:15] <kitche> Tonren: umm Audacity is an audio recording program
[03:15] <scrupul0us> CarlFK: how old is the moftherboard
[03:15] <matthew> ouch, that's heavy lag... 128 seconds
[03:15] <Yashiro> tengo los 8.28.8 OpenGL version string: 2.0.6011 (8.28.8)
[03:15] <PoL> Tonren: When comared to other open source sound editors, Audacity is like the GIMP of paint programs.... lol

[03:16] <BackPacker> cpk1: strange! I tried both mplayer and gstreamer and both appeared to be playing (slider updated) but the box remains blank. It's obviously not just a xine problem.
[03:16] <francis__> how to configure samba to join a windows workgroup?
[03:16] <matthew> i have no idea how to use gcc
[03:16] <scrupul0us> bimberi: graci
[03:16] <bimberi> scrupul0us: np :)
[03:16] <scrupul0us> is this a good setup for postfix? :http://howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p5
[03:16] <Tonren> kitche: You missed my analogy - I said that Audacity is to Garageband as MS Paint is to Photoshop.  PoL claims it's more than just an audio recording and manipulation program... maybe I'll have to take a closer look at it.
[03:16] <tur1> matthew: I have some idea what about?

[03:27] <josh_> Hey guys. I just formatted a PC with dapper (edgy didn't like the wireless card, so it was easier to use 6.06) and after booting up once with no problems I entered in my network information. That was all I did before shutting down and returning to my computer a few ours latter only to find after entering the login details it doesn't load into gnome, it simply stops before it displays the splash screen (although the mouse is there and I

[03:31] <Diego_BH> i think that 6.06
[03:32] <tur1> Diego_BH: if your using gnome, click on Applications - > Add/Remove
[03:32] <kitche> xzk: you have to edit kismet's config to work with your card and such
[03:32] <Diego_BH> turl: ok
[03:32] <Diego_BH> turl: so?
[03:32] <tur1> Diego_BH: then search for VLC

[04:07] <SkramX> oh apt-key  :)
[04:07] <con-man> caliga: how do I COMPLETELY remove my old version of wine
[04:07] <kitche> zac1: sudo apt-get install libc6
[04:07] <LjL> kitche: don't bother - it's not like he wasn't pointed to the *right* pastebin a number of times
[04:07] <x-r00t-x> kitche, then ?
[04:07] <caliga> con-man: like all other packages?

[04:09] <TheDebugger> BysTanDeR: 0.1.3 is out?
[04:09] <TheDebugger> Since when?
[04:09] <LjL> zac1: well anyway, glibc is libc6, which is an implementation of the standard C library. what do you need to know about it?
[04:09] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  the root account is without password . can you tell me how do i change it ?

[04:09] <BysTanDeR> TheDebugger:  couldn't say...i just updated it with my update manager a few days ago....
[04:09] <Dragen> i'm running it, and it has some new cool features, like the transparent cube

[04:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidia8 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:10] <kitche> !nvidia9|keegan_
[04:10] <ubotu> keegan_: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[04:10] <smorque> yo
[04:10] <keegan_> I want 96.31 though
[04:10] <BysTanDeR> yeah that'S it...i took it from an SVN repository
[04:10] <Barry_> Hey, I just wiped my Hoary laptop to put  Edgy on it, and I'm really stoked about most of what I've seen. But I'm missing a few things. Anyone know where the Apple ] [+ screensaver is available?
[04:10] <orestyle5> !repositories
[04:10] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[04:10] <jellegant> last question:  I have an AMD 64 processor.  What kernel should I use?
[04:10] <orestyle5> !EasySource
[04:10] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[04:10] <kitche> keegan_: are those the beta drivers?
[04:11] <keegan_> Nope those are the latest ones
[04:11] <Dragen> keegan_: you still fighting with beryl?  did you run in to that API mismatch?
[04:11] <Micksa> oof
[04:11] <kitche> keegan_: that repo might have the latest as well not sure though
[04:11] <Micksa> is there a channel for linux on amd64?
[04:11] <keegan_> Dragen: I got beryl to run, but after 10 seconds my whole desktop would freeze
[04:12] <Dragen> keegan_: eeek, ok that's not normal at all lol
[04:12] <keegan_> Dragen: So I was thinking maybe if I use the latest drivers, it might happen..
[04:12] <keegan_> work*
[04:12] <orestyle5> !backups
[04:12] <Barry_> Also, Edgy seems to not have an IRC client installed by default. (I'm on a M$ box at the moment.) What's the best general-purpose IRC client for Gnome?
[04:12] <Dragen> keegan_: yes, you definitely should be
[04:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about backups - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:12] <orestyle5> !backup
[04:12] <ubotu> There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !cloning

[04:12] <kitche> keegan_: well remember anything 96* for nvidia driver means you don't need aiglx or XGL
[04:13] <user123> problem: how to listen rm files? helix player error audio/x-pn-realaudio need. How to install?
[04:13] <keegan_> Is that so...I'll remember that.
[04:13] <Dragen> keegan_: kitche is right, the linux driver has the functionality built-in.  you should remove aiglx or xgl
[04:13] <bimberi> Barry_: Gaim does IRC.  Other clients can be installed.
[04:13] <Barry_> bimberi: Thanks.
[04:14] <LjL> "remove AIGLX"?
[04:14] <kitche> Dragen: well I wouldn't remove aiglx, just turn that option off in the xorg.conf but it wouldn't matter anyways if you disable aiglx anyways
[04:15] <Dragen> yea either way is fine.. i just prefer keeping my install clean
[04:15] <Lovloss> Last night i went through heck trying to install the packages i needed to run Anuja c++... this g++ thing, then glib, etc, etc... i still cant figure it out. So whatever, i go to load up "Kino" and try to edit one of my movies, and it comes in all messed up. Whats worse, it wont import non-DV files anymore. Does anyone know what i did/if i did ?
[04:15] <LjL> !find aiglx
[04:15] <ubotu> Package/file aiglx does not exist in edgy
[04:15] <LjL> so how'd you remove it?
[04:15] <jrib> Lovloss: build-essential should give you that dev stuff
[04:15] <kitche> LjL: just disable it in the xorg.conf ServerFlag section
[04:15] <Dragen> it's not a problem if you simply installed the nvidia drivers
[04:16] <Lovloss> i already have build-essential :P
[04:16] <mettallicat> someone used to apt-pinning ?
[04:16] <Lovloss> but i had to manually install glib... which may have been a bad idea
[04:16] <jrib> !someone | mettallicat
[04:16] <ubotu> mettallicat: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:17] <Lovloss> plus i added this gtk-ftp thing that wont uninstall now
[04:17] <Lovloss> *sob*
[04:17] <Barr1> Where can I find the Apple ] [+ screensaver that came with Hoary and isn't included in Edgy?
[04:17] <Hawkline> I can RDP into my Windows box from this laptop running Windows, switch to Ubuntu and I get "connection refused", any ideas?  everything is pretty vanilla
[04:17] <jrib> I won't be committing tonight, have some hw
[04:18] <mettallicat> i'm trying to use apt-get pinning but it just don't work
[04:18] <orestyle5> have you tried aptitude?
[04:19] <orestyle5> actually, what is pinning?
[04:19] <LjL> !pinning
[04:19] <ubotu> pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[04:19] <Lovloss> So... no one knows aht i may have messed up. Again, Kino no longer is able to import media files. And i messed with packages blindly
[04:19] <mettallicat> LjL, i know but is not working
[04:20] <kitche> Lovloss: well if you don't know what you did then no one else will either
[04:20] <Lovloss> i thougfht maybe if someone knew how i could find a log, or if anyone gets kino...;
[04:20] <jared_> I'm in xfce and and want to upgrade from breezy to dapper, whats the command
[04:21] <kitche> Lovloss: log is in /var/log don't know the sub directory or if apt uses it

[04:25] <Dragen> or you can type synaptic
[04:25] <Pelo> beth_,   actualy problem or philosophical objection ?

[04:25] <beth_> I've tried with apt get, also.
[04:25] <Pelo> beth_,  what is the problem ?

[04:25] <Pelo> beth_,  open synaptic ,  enable all the repositories in and try again

[04:29] <francis_> dragen: its not window exe...downloaded it in yahoo...and its for unix.
[04:29] <kitche> francis_: well the .exe is for windows you want to go the unix side of yahoo messenger website
[04:29] <Pelo> Tixer,   just go to  system > admin > printers and add the printer, just like in windows
[04:29] <francis_> gigaclon: yes
[04:29] <YBH_1> If you have a partition swap then try reformating. You can use the gparted live cd to accomplish that.
[04:29] <Dragen> francis_: .exe is a windows binary
[04:29] <Tixer> Its a Lexmark :O
[04:29] <arvind__>  i wish to download complete directory from cvs.sourceforge and the url is http://owl.cvs.sourceforge.net/owl/owl-0.90/ what would be the syntax to download the complete direcotry using terminal commands
[04:29] <Dragen> if you are trying to make a windows app work with linux, you will have to fight with WINE
[04:29] <beth_> lol
[04:30] <Pelo> Tixer,  are you saying he can'T find the printer in the list ?
[04:30] <GigaClon> GAIM does Yahoo messenger
[04:30] <LjL> francis_: from a command line, type "file ~/Desktop/msgr8us.exe", what's the output?
[04:30] <francis_> dragen: so u mean this is not the real yahoo for unix
[04:30] <beth_> Here are some of the dependencies it is asking for: "libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6  libcairo2 libdvdread3 libfreetype6" ... they're all libs.
[04:30] <Tixer> Can't find the printer in the list
[04:30] <Dragen> francis_: .exe is not for unix
[04:30] <Pelo> Tixer,  what model pinter is it
[04:30] <kitche> GigaClon: that's not the point he wants to learn how to install 3rd party software without using a ubuntu package
[04:30] <francis_> ok guys thnks..
[04:30] <Tixer> Lexmark P6250
[04:30] <Dragen> francis_: you can use GAIM, which is a linux native program as a "yahoo messenger" replacement

[04:46] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: you can put it in your .bashrc if you prefer
[04:46] <scrupul0us> oh ok this does support apache2ctl
[04:47] <scrupul0us> im used to apachectl from apache1
[04:47] <drew> what's the package I need to get the flash player working in firefox?  apt-get install ?
[04:47] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: can u walk me through an example or recommend a tutorial?
[04:47] <Lovloss> can gFTP cause problems on my machine?
[04:47] <kitche> drew: sudo apt-get install flash-nonfree
[04:48] <drew> kitche, and things will just work?
[04:48] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: hld on
[04:48] <kitche> drew: should yes you might have to reload firefox
[04:48] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: thank you sir
[04:48] <cafuego_> you WILL have to restart firefox
[04:48] <Lovloss> I apt-get removed kino and it uninstalled fully, i autoremoved, rebooted... and when i reinstalled it all the settings were the same and it still has the same problems
[04:49] <LoRez> Lovloss: you dpkg --purge'd it?
[04:49] <cafuego_> Lovloss: forgot to delete the prefs in your homedirectory
[04:49] <cafuego_> ~/.kinorc
[04:49] <LoRez> or that
[04:49] <Lovloss> how do you do that
[04:49] <drew> ow come the first user I set up has @drew int eh shell prompt, but the other ones don't?  Is that in .bash_profile?
[04:50] <Telroth> hello all!
[04:50] <joe__> hi
[04:50] <joe__> where can i find media codecs for ubuntu ?
[04:50] <drew> Oops, no .bash_profile...
[04:50] <Lovloss> Whats the command to purge kino then?
[04:50] <dfcarney> !codecs
[04:50] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:51] <dfcarney> Lovloss: after you 'apt-get remove ...' the package, search around for the .config file or folder (in your homedir) and then move or delete it
[04:51] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: sorry. in your .bashrc file, just add alias apache2='/etc/init.d/apache2'
[04:51] <joe__> media codecs?
[04:51] <ArrenLex> I have set up openssh-server. How do I customise the message that appears on login?
[04:51] <joebob> noob has a question about ubuntu live cd
[04:51] <Telroth> I'm planning on doing some major updates to my system (new proc, new mobo, new ram, new graphics card). I'd really like to not install kubuntu again. What changes would I need to make to my configs to set up the new hardware correctly? (keeping same proc family, P4->core 2 duo (both x86))
[04:51] <cafuego_> ArrenLex: /etc/motd
[04:52] <dfcarney> Lovloss: it'll be hidden and probably have a similar name to the package.  As cafuego_ suggested, it may be ~/.kinorc (so you'll need to 'rm -rf ~/.kinorc).
[04:52] <joebob> on the livecd, i can't get my ps/2 mouse or keyboard to work
[04:52] <ArrenLex> cafuego_: Thanks!
[04:52] <john_> is there anyone using dansgardian GUI packaged put together by  nanomad
[04:52] <Lovloss> aha
[04:52] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: when you done edit the file, just type source .bashrc. then type apache2 restart
[04:53] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: just at the bottom ok? and do i have to restart anything?
[04:53] <Lovloss> so cafuego_, you know anything about Kino? I want it to work again
[04:53] <x-r00t-x> apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
[04:53] <asgilder> Okay...how do I install programs from packages that I've downloaded? I opened both add/remove AND synaptic, and neither package was int the list.

[04:53] <joebob> can someone help me with just getting my mouse and keyboard to work?
[04:53] <scrupul0us> doh
[04:53] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: that is fine. or just after alias lines.

[04:57] <ubotu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[04:57] <craig_> I typed sudo apt-get install flash-nonfree and got Couldn't find package flash-nonfree.  What's up
[04:57] <kitche> !ask|Robotlion
[04:57] <ubotu> Robotlion: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:57] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: it doesn't work? here's one of my aliases --> alias orarestart='sudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe restart'
[04:57] <dsnyders> Hi all!  Is the ubuntu DVD a mix of the normal and alternate CDs?
[04:57] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: that should give you an idea
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[04:58] <transgress_> craig_: did you enable multi/uni/verse?
[04:58] <craig_> Robotlion, I said, What's up.  I meant "What's the trouble you're having wiht installign a printer?"
[04:58] <jimbodappernoob> just looking at Google joebob - to see if there is an install command or similar
[04:58] <kitche> dsnyders: the dvd has more packages on it not sure if it's a mix though
[04:58] <ArrenLex> dsnyders: No. It just includes all (or most) the packages.
[04:58] <ArrenLex> +of
[04:58] <joebob> cool cool thanks
[04:58] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: i didnt have the alias in the front.. never the less.. new error: root@web:~# apache2 restart
[04:58] <scrupul0us> -bash: /etc/init.d/apache2: No such file or directory
[04:58] <craig_> transgress_, how do you do that?  I used the gui to install xchat, and I think universe was enabled.
[04:58] <dsnyders> ArrenLex, Thanks.  You too, kitche
[04:59] <Lovloss> Alright im just going to ask this generally, since its *slightly* off topic, but i dont know where else to get the data at this point. If anyone uses Kino and understands how to import DV files without them being screwy, pleeeeeease PM me :) thanks
[04:59] <Telroth> if anyone can import dv files at all in kino, please PM me, thanks :P
[04:59] <Lovloss> you cant? o.o
[04:59] <dfcarney> Lovloss: do you have a sample DV file that someone could use as a test?
[04:59] <Telroth> no, it doesnt' work
[04:59] <Lovloss> Well my DV is huge.
[04:59] <Telroth> not from my dv camcorder
[05:00] <Telroth> err
[05:00] <Telroth> wait
[05:00] <Telroth> i can't capture
[05:00] <Robotlion> I can't print
[05:00] <Lovloss> The point is when i try to open it, it has big giant horizontal black lines going through it
[05:00] <Telroth> never tried import
[05:00] <Lovloss> yet it runs normally in VLC !
[05:00] <dfcarney> Lovloss: have you tried other DV files?
[05:00] <kevin_> I have two hard drives in my computer, and one is ntfs, and the other has ubuntu 6.10 on it. I know that both drives work, and Ubuntu boots up and connect to the net and all that good stuff, but I can't seem to be able to access the ntfs drive. I also am not able to share files between the two computers that are networked, (both have Ubuntu).
[05:00] <Lovloss> i dont have any but i could try. i expect its got something to do with how the thing treats DV though
[05:01] <Tixer> Kevin_ get Samba (I think), and NTFS-3G
[05:01] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: try this one --> alias aparestart='sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart'
[05:01] <dfcarney> Lovloss: well, it'll be an easier problem to tackle if you can eliminate possible sources of error
[05:01] <Robotlion> I need printer instructions
[05:01] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: how can that be right... I know its a file!
[05:01] <Tixer> I had that problem 2 days ago, but I'm on Fedora
[05:01] <dfcarney> !cups | Robotlion
[05:01] <ubotu> Robotlion: Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[05:01] <Lovloss> im turning a music video to a DV right now to check
[05:01] <kitche> Robotlion: who's the maker of the printer?
[05:01] <Tixer> Lexmark
[05:01] <dfcarney> kevin_: can you see both of the drives from Ubuntu?
[05:02] <lemao> Parallels + MacBookPro + ubuntu-6.10-server-i386.iso = "Boot error : Unknown Interrupt or fault at EIP...". Any ideas?
[05:02] <Tixer> Its a Lexmark P6250
[05:02] <kitche> ah Lexmark .... those are hard to get working
[05:02] <kevin_> no
[05:02] <Robotlion> yes
[05:02] <Tixer> yeah
[05:02] <jimbodappernoob> joebob: see this link http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=298166
[05:02] <dfcarney> kevin_: are they on different controller cards, or both connected directly to your motherboard?
[05:02] <Robotlion> I know Linux and Lexmark don;t work usually
[05:02] <kevin_> dfcarney: how do you do the pm type thing?
[05:03] <ArrenLex> Is there any way to run some commands whenever a user logs in?
[05:03] <Lovloss> No that DV works fine! I wonder what could be wrong with this one. It works fine in VLC
[05:03] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: i did this: alias wwwreload='/etc/init.d/apache2 restart' and got: -bash: /etc/init.d/apache2: No such file or directory
[05:03] <dfcarney> kevin_: i'm not sure :)
[05:03] <kitche> Robotlion: linuxprinting.org will probably have some good information
[05:03] <craig_> transgress_, I've enabled universe in the apt conf file.  Still get the same message
[05:03] <kevin_> dfcarney: so i got it?
[05:03] <jimbodappernoob> joebob: you are not the only one with the problem - check BIOS and USB keyboard options
[05:03] <Robotlion> thanks
[05:03] <Lovloss> Does anyone know of any programs that can turn a DV file into an mpeg :)
[05:03] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: mencoder
[05:03] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: odd.
[05:03] <Lovloss> ahhh that sounds promising
[05:03] <kevin_> dfcarney: anywho, they are both on the mobo
[05:03] <joebob> neither my mouse or keyboard are usb
[05:03] <ArrenLex> !mencoder
[05:03] <ubotu> mencoder: MPlayer's Movie Encoder. In component multiverse, is extra. Version 2:0.99+1.0pre8-0ubuntu8 (edgy), package size 3171 kB, installed size 7956 kB
[05:03] <ArrenLex> :)
[05:03] <jimbodappernoob> Read the link joebob
[05:04] <dfcarney> kevin_: if you type 'cat /proc/partitions' then do you see 2+ devices?
[05:04] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: indeed... you sure running source .bashrc is all i have to run?
[05:04] <craig_> Robotlion, what's the model?
[05:04] <Tixer> P6250
[05:04] <dfcarney> kevin_: i.e. sda and sdb?
[05:04] <Tixer> craig: P6250
[05:04] <craig_> Ahh.
[05:04] <Tixer> yeah
[05:04] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: yep
[05:04] <Tixer> I was helping him, before his dad spazzed on me
[05:04] <Tixer> that was massive lulz
[05:04] <Lovloss> oh mencoder works in teh command line?
[05:04] <Tixer> yeah
[05:05] <Tixer> get a frontend to it
[05:05] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us:  all it does to reread the file and it will do whatever you command
[05:05] <scrupul0us> it def doesnt like it... WTF... im on edgy is that makes ANY diff
[05:05] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: yes.
[05:05] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: but there are many frontends available for it.
[05:05] <Lovloss> ok ill grab one
[05:05] <craig_> Tixer, Did his dad spaz privately or somehting?  I do't see it.
[05:05] <Tixer> I was talking to him on the phone
[05:05] <Tixer> I know him
[05:05] <craig_> Ahh.
[05:05] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: it does not make a difference. hmm.
[05:06] <Lovloss> theres a solution to everything in linux :) but one day ill need to clean install again, now that i know more
[05:06] <joebob> it looks like i need to disable usb keyboard/mouse in bios...well that's something i can try
[05:06] <Tixer> anyways, his dad kept insisting that "Firefox" was messing up "teh systemz" and not letting him view the EXEs he gets in Emails >.<
[05:06] <Surghi> Hi
[05:06] <craig_> Tixer, I typed sudo apt-get install flash-nonfree and got Couldn't find package flash-nonfree.  What's up?  I've enabled universe in the apt conf file.
[05:06] <Surghi> I am just instlaling
[05:06] <lemao> Parallels + MacBookPro + ubuntu-6.10-server-i386.iso = "Boot error : Unknown Interrupt or fault at EIP...". Any ideas?
[05:06] <Surghi> I need to partition the disk manually
[05:06] <Surghi> there is one NTFS for Windows
[05:06] <jimbodappernoob> Yeah joebob haha strange but true - however it may not be the answer to your ps/2 problem
[05:06] <Surghi> the rest is free space
[05:06] <con-man> has anyone here solved the 3D accelerator error while trying to run World of Warcraft with wine?
[05:06] <Tixer> I don't know if flash is on universe
[05:06] <con-man> has anyone here solved the 3D acceleration error while trying to run World of Warcraft with wine?
[05:06] <joebob> yea i'm not sure that will help..but it's something
[05:06] <Eclypse> ljl, that little bot trick that you sent me doesn't work, at all.
[05:06] <Tixer> I use fedora, so I'm not much help
[05:06] <craig_> Tixer, the exe files he gets in emails.....hmmm
[05:07] <Surghi> I want to add a FAT32 partition and a SWAP  +  1 big partition for Linux
[05:07] <Tixer> yeah
[05:07] <Lovloss> hmm the package manager cant find any mencoder frontends.
[05:07] <Tixer> I lol'd
[05:07] <Surghi> what filesystem should I use for EDGY EFT `
[05:07] <IcemanV9> craig_: it's flashPLUGIN-nonfree
[05:07] <craig_> WIth caps?
[05:07] <Dial_tone> I don't see the cubed symbol in character map anywhere. anyone know it?
[05:07] <IcemanV9> craig_: no
[05:07] <dfcarney> Surghi: ext3
[05:07] <scrupul0us> IcemanV9: HAHAHA im a dumb bastard... i just reformatted... apache isnt installed yet
[05:07] <Tixer> ext3
[05:07] <cpk1> Lovloss: there isnt one, spend some time reading the man =)
[05:07] <scrupul0us> LOL
[05:07] <Zambezi> Isn't there a way to block IP that portscans?
[05:07] <con-man> has anyone here solved the 3D accelerator error while trying to run World of Warcraft with wine?
[05:07] <Lovloss> oh okay
[05:07] <kevin_> dfcarney: yeah i see the drive
[05:07] <Pie-rate> con-man: What's the error?
[05:08] <Surghi> so I will have 1) NTFS Primary,  2) EXT3 Primary,  3) SWAP Primary 4) FAT32 Primary
[05:08] <IcemanV9> scrupul0us: oh jeez. lol
[05:08] <Surghi> right?
[05:08] <cpk1> Lovloss: not sure what you are trying to do, but yo could try out avidemux
[05:08] <dfcarney> kevin_: well, if it's not mounted automatically, you can always try to mount it manually
[05:08] <con-man> Pie-rate: unable to start 3D acceleration
[05:08] <Surghi> or can't SWAP be primary?
[05:08] <craig_> IcemanV9, Couldn't find package flashplugin-nonfree
[05:08] <kevin_> dfcarney: I want to read and write to it, will that still work with a mount point thingamajigger?
[05:09] <jimbodappernoob> SWAP is always logical. Please tell me if I'm wrong
[05:09] <Tixer> yes
[05:09] <Pie-rate> con-man: tell me what "glxinfo|grepdirect" says
[05:09] <Tixer> you're rught
[05:09] <Tixer> *right
[05:09] <IcemanV9> craig_: it is in multiverse repo (and backports)
[05:09] <Surghi> So SWAP logical, the rest primary?
[05:09] <dfcarney> kevin_: yeah, but you'll need to install ntfs-3g for r/w support to NTFS
[05:09] <IcemanV9> craig_: make sure you enable your repo thru /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:09] <kevin_> dfcarney: i can't download it
[05:09] <kevin_> or install it
[05:10] <con-man> Pie-rate: bash: grepdirect: command not found
[05:10] <con-man> bash: glxinfo: command not found
[05:10] <kevin_> dfcarney: be back in a bit, sorry
[05:10] <craig_> I dont' see a multi but there is a backports... ok
[05:10] <dfcarney> kevin_: ok
[05:10] <Surghi> If I want to install many programs,  will 15 GB for Ubuntu be enough?
[05:10] <jimbodappernoob> Surghi: I make the Linux partition a logical one and install GRUB on the MBR
[05:10] <Pie-rate> Interesting. Are you running 6.10 (edgy)?
[05:10] <con-man> Pie-rate: yes
[05:11] <dfcarney> !ntfs-3g
[05:11] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution.

[05:11] <RegalEagle> Can someone help me configure Blackbox? I checked in the Blackbox channel but no one answers.
[05:11] <jevangelo> is there a way to have .rar file capability
[05:11] <IcemanV9> craig_: 7.0.x is in multi and 9.0.x is in backports
[05:11] <cherubiel> !rar | jevangelo
[05:11] <ubotu> jevangelo: rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[05:11] <jevangelo> iv tried like 4 different archive managers and they dont work with them
[05:11] <con-man> Pie-rate: any ideas?
[05:11] <Pie-rate> con-man: Have you installed drivers for your video card?
[05:11] <craig_> IcemanV9, do I have to restart apt or something?
[05:12] <con-man> Pie-rate: yes. fglrx
[05:12] <RegalEagle> Someone help me configure Blackbox?
[05:12] <Lovloss> mencoder 1.dv 2.mpeg ? says it doesnt work... i dont get this >.<
[05:12] <Pie-rate> strange that you don't have glxinfo, but i'm not sure what package glxinfo is from.
[05:12] <Pie-rate> con-man: You may get better results in #winehq
[05:12] <cpk1> Lovloss: what are you trying to do?
[05:13] <sc4ttrbrain> !fuse
[05:13] <Lovloss> turn 1.dv to 2.mpeg
[05:13] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[05:13] <dfcarney> Pie-rate: 'apt-cache search glxinfo' says that it's in 'mesa-utils'
[05:13] <RegalEagle> !blackbox

[05:13] <Lovloss> so it will be an mpeg
[05:13] <RegalEagle> I need help with Blackbox :/
[05:13] <craig_> RegalEagle, Good luck; I tried openbox today and had to say uncle...
[05:13] <Surghi> Hey guys I get a bigger problem .... When I partition the HD manually,  I get QTparted to do it (in the installer) ....  I created the EXT3 one Primary.   Now I am just creating SWAP.   The Problem is:  When I select "Create as: Extended"   the  "Partition Type" field where I could select  "linux-swap" becomes inactive ....
[05:13] <IcemanV9> craig_: just update
[05:13] <Pie-rate> WoW+wine+nvidia twinview puts WoW on the second screen, I want it to stretch WoW over both screens. How would I do that?
[05:14] <con-man> lol
[05:14] <RegalEagle> IcemanV9: How do you update Blackbox?
[05:14] <con-man> Pie-rate: wouldnt that look weird
[05:14] <Pie-rate> con-man: no, i use viewport to put UI stuff on the second screen
[05:14] <craig_> RegalEagle, I think he's talking about my apt issue
[05:14] <jimbodappernoob> try EXT3 as logical
[05:14] <RegalEagle> craig_: ...oh >_>
[05:14] <Surghi> what if I create SWAP primary?
[05:14] <Surghi> would it be a problem?
[05:14] <dfcarney> Surghi: i think that's because the swap pas to be a primary partition, doesn't it?
[05:15] <RegalEagle> Well, I just need to get a skin on Blackbox and to get programs and crap in the right-click list
[05:15] <cpk1> Lovloss: ffmpeg is easier to use and i think can handle .dv
[05:15] <Surghi> dfcarney: they guys just told me it must be logical
[05:15] <jimbodappernoob> surghi I just have to check my partitions brb
[05:15] <dfcarney> Surghi: it's been a while for me :)  I last configured my machine (manually) about 4 years ago.

[05:16] <RegalEagle> So no one is able to help me with BlackBox?
[05:16] <Lovloss> okay come on, surely there is a *graphical* conversion program that can turn my .dv file into something else
[05:16] <cpk1> Lovloss: ffmpeg -i myfile.dv -target vcd /home/lovloss/myfile.mpg
[05:17] <vader> RegalEagle, my friend could but he is in a meeting for the rest of the night :)
[05:17] <cpk1> Lovloss: of course it doesnt have to be vcd
[05:17] <justin_> Lovloss: Possibly, but I know of none.. im sure you could find one on Google, if not you can always create your own ;D
[05:17] <RegalEagle> vader: Well get him here...
[05:17] <dfcarney> Surghi: Just checked...  Either primary or logical can be used for SWAP
[05:17] <RegalEagle> :p
[05:17] <vader> RegalEagle, if it were possible :)
[05:17] <craig_> RegalEagle, What are you trying to do exactly?
[05:17] <Surghi> dfcarney  does "Either" mean that both are OK ?
[05:17] <Surghi> or nether nor?
[05:17] <jimbodappernoob> Surghi I use logical for Swap and EXT3 but I think you need a boot loader on your MBR to do that
[05:17] <dfcarney> Surghi: Yes -- both are ok
[05:18] <Surghi> ok
[05:18] <Surghi> thank you guys
[05:18] <Surghi> brb
[05:18] <Lovloss> *sigh* ok.
[05:18] <RegalEagle> craig_: I just installed BlackBox. All I have is a blank screen, the toolbar, and xterm in the right-click.
[05:18] <dfcarney> RegalEagle: that sounds about right for BlackBox.  Congratulations!  :)
[05:18] <craig_> Well, that's more than I got with openbox...
[05:18] <RegalEagle> How do I install themes?
[05:18] <RegalEagle> Fluxbox had more than this >_>
[05:18] <craig_> dfcarney, do you make your menu the same in blackbox as in fluxbox?
[05:19] <dfcarney> craig_: I have no idea.  I don't use either -- co-workers of mine have, however...
[05:19] <Lovloss> the command did the trick, at any rate
[05:19] <dfcarney> craig_: I'm an ion fan, myself.
[05:19] <Lovloss> youd think they'd make that a visual thing.
[05:19] <craig_> Criminy, how many wm's are there?
[05:19] <RegalEagle> Well, Ive got themes specifically for Blackbox.
[05:19] <RegalEagle> and I want to use them

[05:29] <swiltig> Hello, niru!
[05:29] <dfcarney> FC6_User: seriously, did you have any reason to upgrade?  if there's no compelling reason to remain at 6.10 then it may just be eaiser (for now) to downgrade.
[05:29] <IcemanV9> elhaxxorz: i didn't go that far; let me check ..
[05:29] <gregben> Hi, did a system update and now eth0 configures itself as ipv6 only. I can manually fix by disabling, re-enabling eth0, but have to repeat at every reboot. How to fix?
[05:30] <dfcarney> FC6_User: if you want to investigate, find out the name of the driver that's required to support that chipset and find the related changelog for it (that describes the changes between your previous version and 6.10)
[05:30] <niru> swiltig:hi
[05:30] <FC6_User> no reason to upgrade, except that I want ATI accelerated drivers on my laptop
[05:30] <niru> swiltig:Have you tried with installable cd creation with kde packages and installer as d-i
[05:31] <niru> any body else has any idea on installable cd creation with kde packages
[05:31] <dfcarney> FC6_User: the answer may be as simple as the driver isn't automatically loaded now, whereas it was before.  step 1: find the name of the driver.  step 2: use 'lsmod' to see if it's installed and running
[05:32] <a52x3> how do i find out what sound card i have?
[05:32] <elhaxxorz> a52x3, lspci should do that
[05:32] <dfcarney> a52x3: 'lspci -v' will give you a quick dump of system-related info
[05:32] <FC6_User> how can i find the name?
[05:32] <FC6_User> and how to intall it or make it running?
[05:32] <dfcarney> FC6_User: I suggest Google
[05:32] <niru> any idea on installable cd creation with kde packages

[05:33] <dfcarney> FC6_User: 'modprobe' is a utility to install modules
[05:33] <matiseijas> hello, can somebody help me? I'm trying to upgrade from 5.10 and everytime I run the command 'gksu "update-manager -c" ' and I enter my password it tells me I've typed a wrong password. I've retried this method a billion times and I still get the same error. What can I do to fix it??
[05:33] <jimbodappernoob> FC6_User another command at a terminal is ifconfig -a it will show you all network interfaces
[05:33] <nomasteryoda|w> if its not loaded, the maybe modprobe file
[05:33] <nomasteryoda|w> matiseijas, try the command line version instead
[05:33] <nomasteryoda|w> apt-get update
[05:33] <trurl> Hi
[05:33] <dfcarney> jimbodappernoob: good point
[05:34] <nomasteryoda|w> sudo apt-get update
[05:34] <jimbodappernoob> love your work dfcarney 8-)
[05:34] <FC6_User> ok, another Q
[05:34] <matiseijas> should i do that? cuz the wiki states that "Please note - this method is much less reliable. If you use this method, you MUST be prepared to fix problems manually, such as packages being unexpectedly removed, apt crashing unexpectantly, etc. Using Update Manager (see above) is likely to be much less problematic."
[05:34] <dfcarney> jimbodappernoob: haha
[05:34] <FC6_User> why ATI drivers cannot install, script err
[05:34] <[pyro] > hey guys
[05:35] <nomasteryoda|w> matiseijas, that can happen... but i've not seen it here. The official stance is its not supported... going from clean install is best
[05:35] <dfcarney> FC6_User: that's a pretty vague question.  Can you clarify?
[05:35] <jimbodappernoob> Fix the first problem FC6 and then move on to the second
[05:35] <nomasteryoda|w> but anyways... apt-get update then apt-get upgrade then apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:35] <matiseijas> isn't there any way to fix the password thing?
[05:35] <nomasteryoda|w> all sudo
[05:35] <trurl> matiseijas: the what?
[05:36] <FC6_User> when i run the scrip, ATI xyz-installer.sh, i got a message like script err: syntax err ...
[05:36] <nomasteryoda|w> matiseijas, if you forgot it, there is a way to boot up and reset it
[05:36] <nomasteryoda|w> !password
[05:36] <ubotu> Forgot your password? Boot into recovery mode. What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
[05:36] <matiseijas> really?? how can I do that?
[05:36] <nomasteryoda|w> thats it

[05:43] <Lovloss> how do you change the default program for a file type? i prefer VLC to toem

[05:47] <chronic1> anyone here have any troubule with wine -- i never get passed the "wine: creating configuration directory" when starting up wine for the first time
[05:47] <kelvie> dfcarney: I just want to be able to set my IP settings (i.e. the stuff I pass to ifconfig) depending on the MAC address of the router
[05:47] <whyameye> kelvie: I think it would be much easier to detect the ESSID that the router is sending, which is the way what you want to do is typically done.
[05:47] <dfcarney> kelvie: and you don't want to use DHCP?

[05:47] <lordmaynoth2> or am I going to have to reformat
[05:47] <nomasteryoda|w> chronic1, remove the ~/.wine folder... just a possiblity
[05:47] <kelvie> whyameye: That's for wireless
[05:48] <kelvie> whyameye: for wireless.. there's a file in /etc/conf.d is there not?
[05:48] <nomasteryoda|w> kelvie, ok there is another tool
[05:48] <whyameye> kelvie: oh sorry. I was assuming wireless.
[05:48] <nomasteryoda|w> just sec
[05:48] <dfcarney> kelvie: hmmm.  offhand, i'm not sure.  i'll poke around and see what i can find.
[05:48] <kelvie> nomasteryoda: I don't mind editing config files or putting in some bash magic :p
[05:48] <kelvie> don't really need a tool per se
[05:48] <nomasteryoda|w> right
[05:48] <kelvie> is there an ubuntu network guide?
[05:48] <chronic1> nomasteryoda|w: doesn't ever get that far...the file is a temp directory
[05:48] <kelvie> so I know how the network scripts work :/
[05:48] <nomasteryoda|w> guessnet
[05:49] <nomasteryoda|w> ah

[05:59] <Micksa> it would be rather
[05:59] <Micksa> I was thinking the other way around I guess
[05:59] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: : import what?
[05:59] <w30> Micksa, it might be dangerous because there is some configuring done at install by reading the machine hardware but you can't loose by just trying it. I don't think all you config files will get rewriten by Linux just because you changed motherboards and cpu's. It may not work though.
[05:59] <Micksa> use i368 versions of apps that don't behave in amd64
[05:59] <fbc> Anyone got any tips for making my BCM4318 work more reliably?
[06:00] <x-r00t-x> sc4ttrbrain, the theme
[06:00] <SuperQ> Micksa: yea.. that sometimes works
[06:00] <x-r00t-x> http://www.biodesign.com.ar/blog/?p=27
[06:00] <sc4ttrbrain> diabolix: : whats the error output?
[06:00] <Micksa> that's basically what you have to do with amd64 anyway
[06:00] <Micksa> with all the x86-only binary apps out there
[06:00] <SuperQ> some apps are still crabby (like vmware)
[06:00] <sc4ttrbrain> checking
[06:00] <Dekkard> does anyone here know jorge castro?
[06:00] <SuperQ> but it's mostly because of kernel hooks
[06:00] <Micksa> I don't get why stuff isn't much faster on amd64 tho
[06:00] <SuperQ> Micksa: I say grab a new drive, and put amd64 on the board
[06:01] <francis_> already have samba installed. how to configure it to share my files in a window workgroup?
[06:01] <SuperQ> Micksa: and play with it for a few weeks
[06:01] <Micksa> I mean, shouldn't that like, double the speed of all memory copies?
[06:01] <SuperQ> Micksa: then copy your data over
[06:01] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: : first u should have emerald , emerald-theme installed first, fetch the theme, install linsta or linsta2
[06:01] <SuperQ> that way you can see how you like it
[06:01] <SuperQ> without risk to your running server
[06:01] <Dekkard> or whiprush?
[06:01] <x-r00t-x> ya sc4ttrbrain i am using vista theme
[06:02] <Micksa> could have have a amd64 chroot inside the x86 system, using an amd64 kernel? would that work?
[06:02] <diabolix> sc4ttrbrain: lemme install a cli irc client.
[06:02] <w30> Micksa, 64 bits really shines with databases and other server applications that work with a lot of data so maybe you need 64 bit and maybe you don't.
[06:02] <diabolix> so i can run a screen session that wont disconnect..
[06:02] <SuperQ> Micksa: that also works, and works the other way
[06:02] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: : if u want transparancy on title bar, check the available theme on your emerald setting
[06:02] <Micksa> excellent
[06:02] <Micksa> that might be my strategy then
[06:02] <SuperQ> Micksa: some developers I know run 32bit chroot inside 64bit OS for doing builds
[06:02] <RMorris84> how do i share files with my ubuntu laptop with my windows laptop? both connected to the same router?
[06:02] <x-r00t-x> sc4ttrbrain, oh man you dont understand
[06:03] <sc4ttrbrain> the tell me
[06:03] <diabolix> is there a guide to getting beryl working? or a script that will install it?
[06:03] <ct12am> Does anyone know the trick to chown a tty to let two people control the same terminal session at once?
[06:03] <SuperQ> w30: yea.. I had a postgresql database running on an alphalinux box back in 99
[06:03] <SuperQ> w30: that thing flew
[06:03] <Micksa> superq: do you need the 64bit kernel to run 64bit apps?
[06:03] <sc4ttrbrain> diabolix: : http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Main_Page
[06:03] <SuperQ> Micksa: very much yes
[06:03] <Micksa> okay
[06:03] <tupa> how do i add a user to sudoers for sudo to ask me the password
[06:03] <Micksa> just checking :)
[06:03] <x-r00t-x> http://www.biodesign.com.ar/image/thum/vc-dark.jpg look at the pic and see  where is menu like : file edit view terminal tabs help
[06:03] <SuperQ> you're better off starting 64
[06:03] <SuperQ> and adding 32 as needed
[06:03] <francis_> RMorris: 1st u need to install samba
[06:04] <x-r00t-x> and that bg wont work
[06:04] <bobsaget> DCC SCHAT isoiledmypantaloon
[06:04] <jevangelo> is blackdown java still good to go with?
[06:04] <dyzlex> Can someone please tell me if PCMCIA is the same as "PC Card Slots (2)" on older compaq laptops?
[06:04] <Micksa> superq: I want to get the new board into the server anyway, for the extra ram (currently 256M)
[06:04] <francis_> what does sudo mean
[06:04] <Micksa> so I don't want to wait till after I've spent a few weeks playing with amd64
[06:04] <SuperQ> Micksa: oof
[06:04] <ct12am> assume user
[06:04] <trurl> dyzlex: how old?
[06:04] <Micksa> indeed
[06:04] <DBO> sorry for the dirty word folks
[06:04] <tupa> can anyone help me
[06:04] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: : actually if u installed the "gtk engine" and the correspondent theme, it will show up, even without beyl, if thats the only u want
[06:05] <RMorris84> how do i share files with my ubuntu laptop with my windows laptop? both connected to the same router?
[06:05] <sgorilla80> is it possible to rate limit an interface?
[06:05] <dyzlex> trurl: http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11382_div/11382_div.HTML
[06:05] <francis_> pinoy?
[06:05] <Micksa> so yeah, when I'm ready I'll move the whole system into /old and install from scratch :)
[06:05] <SuperQ> tupa: just ask your question
[06:05] <w30> Micksa, the down side of 64 bit is no wmv9, flashplayer, and not realplayer support yet.
[06:05] <ct12am> Does anyone know the trick to chown a tty to let two people control the same terminal session at once?
[06:05] <Micksa> w30: those can be worked around, according to what I've read
[06:05] <x-r00t-x> sc4ttrbrain, how do i get it ?
[06:05] <francis_> RMorris84: u need samba installed 1st...then lets ask some help here how to configure it
[06:05] <trurl> dyzlex: yeah, thats pcmcia
[06:05] <bimberi> jevangelo: sun java is available, and probably preferable
[06:05] <sgorilla80> ct12am: you should learn about screen
[06:05] <Micksa> is it true that intel is copying the amd64 arch anyway now?
[06:06] <tupa> how do i add a user to sudoers to ask me for the password
[06:06] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: : u should find what gtk engine needed for your theme to work
[06:06] <jevangelo> thats good to know
[06:06] <w30> Micksa, yes but you can do that not me. I ain't smart enough :=(
[06:06] <tupa> SuperQ, can u give your input here
[06:06] <dyzlex> trurl: Thanks
[06:06] <jimbodappernoob> ct12am: what about a VNC or RDP session?
[06:06] <Micksa> w30: sorry :)
[06:06] <jevangelo> i had so much trouble with java when i used to use gentoo
[06:06] <IcemanV9> tupa: visudo
[06:06] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: : should be an info where u download the theme itself
[06:06] <ct12am> sgorilla80: the method I've used to do it before used screen, but also a chown hack... are you saying you can do it with screen alone?
[06:06] <trurl> dyzlex: btw: thats not "old", thats pretty up-to-date ;)
[06:06] <sgorilla80> ct12am: yes
[06:06] <sgorilla80> ct12am: screen -x
[06:07] <SuperQ> tupa: you are trying to grand sudo access to another user?
[06:07] <x-r00t-x> sc4ttrbrain, http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=49590
[06:07] <ct12am> jimbodappernoob: aight
[06:07] <ct12am> sgorilla80: thx looking into it...
[06:07] <w30> Micksa, I learn more Linux every day and enjoy it very much though.
[06:07] <sgorilla80> i guess im goign to rate limit at the application layer, instead of of lower levels
[06:07] <SuperQ> heh
[06:07] <x-r00t-x> sc4ttrbrain, Recommended GTK themes: LiNsta, LiNsta2
[06:08] <RMorris84> francis_: i have samba installed
[06:08] <tupa> yes, i added my user like this tupa ALL=(ALL) ALL
[06:08] <SuperQ> w30: how long have you been using linux (other)
[06:08] <sgorilla80> i never liked iptables, needs to be more like pf
[06:08] <tupa> but it doesn't ask me for my password when i make sudo
[06:08] <SuperQ> use
[06:08] <SuperQ> that's normal
[06:08] <SuperQ> use/yes
[06:08] <SuperQ> that's how sudo works
[06:08] <Wiseguy> hey guys, does open office support word 2003 docs by default?
[06:08] <tupa> ?, shouldnt it ask me for my user password?
[06:08] <SuperQ> also, you shouldn't need to add that in ubuntu, because it uses the admin group to grant access
[06:09] <sc4ttrbrain> x-r00t-x: : u should try google first ;) simple google found this http://susewiki.org/index.php?title=Consistent_Appearance_between_Gnome_and_KDE_using_QtCurve#Enabling_QtCurve_in_GNOME
[06:09] <SuperQ> tupa: yes, it should ask for your user password
[06:09] <trurl> Q: where can i change colors used in window titles, window background etc. Do i have to use a theme or can i adjust these colors somewhere?
[06:09] <w30> SuperQ, since RedHat 4.6 but I am self taught. I have never met a Linux user in person. I mostly learn over the internet (irc and Google)
[06:09] <SuperQ> wow
[06:09] <ct12am> I served a man in a Linux polo seafood in Carlisle PA
[06:10] <ct12am> Giant grocery store
[06:10] <SuperQ> where do you live that there are no other users around?
[06:10] <ct12am> Canada?
[06:10] <jimbodappernoob> w30: join the club. All my friends and aquainances run Windows
[06:10] <sickOfWork> wiseguy: for the most part but real support will be in the new OpenOffice that Novell just forked
[06:10] <sc4ttrbrain> me tooo, full of windoze user here !
[06:10] <w30> SuperQ, closest Linux User club is in Rockford, Ill.
[06:10] <DARKGuy> Lol, I'm full of windows around here too
[06:11] <w30> SuperQ, which is 65 miles away.
[06:11] <ct12am> I'm using kubuntu on an a30 thinkpad because my powerbook ac adapter is broken
[06:11] <sc4ttrbrain> i even on w1ndoze rite now
[06:11] <ct12am> and Linux is better than the state I left it in
[06:11] <jimbodappernoob> Lets start the "Single Linux User in Windows Land" club
[06:11] <ct12am> No texmate, but...vim
[06:11] <DARKGuy> Lol
[06:11] <SuperQ> w30: ahh.. yea.. not a fun drive for a lug meeting
[06:11] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[06:11] <DARKGuy> Wild land (?)
[06:12] <Wiseguy> sickOfWork, forked to cost money?
[06:12] <francis_> how to log in as root
[06:12] <ct12am> I'm near RDU North Carolina, the only Unix users I run into is when I buy cheap Sun hardware from dopes working at MCI etc
[06:12] <w30> SuperQ, I have time but no money so Linux suits me just fine.
[06:12] <ct12am> Well, I'm the dope I guess, buying sparcs
[06:12] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: :sudo su
[06:12] <sickOfWork> I don't believe they can charge for it..
[06:13] <kevin_> dfcarney: you still there?
[06:13] <ArrenLex> Where do I set the hostname for ssh? So I can type "ssh hostname" to get to my machine on my local network rather than an IP?
[06:13] <DARKGuy> I just discovered... Azureus is -stupid-
[06:13] <sgorilla80> ct12am: can you get good prices on keyboards?
[06:13] <kevin_> ebay.com
[06:13] <ct12am> ArrenLex: /etc/hosts ?
[06:13] <DARKGuy> Is there a bittorrent client that doesn't crashes after you accidentally or forcefully kill X?
[06:13] <sc4ttrbrain> ArrenLex: : ssh user@hostname
[06:13] <sgorilla80> well sun keyboards
[06:13] <ct12am> sgorilla80: got one with a Sparc10, $40 with monitor
[06:14] <sc4ttrbrain> oops misread
[06:14] <ct12am> but...LUG mailing lists always have dudes dumping company Suns
[06:14] <ct12am> I like the lunchbox IPC style Sparcs
[06:14] <moshe> DARKGuy: you could always run the command line client in terminal ctrl-alt-2 through 6 instead of running it in X
[06:14] <RMorris84> how do i share files with my ubuntu laptop with my windows laptop? both connected to the same router?
[06:14] <jimbodappernoob> ct12am: as long as they don't dump Core
[06:14] <kevin_> I have two hard drives in my computer, and one is ntfs, and the other has ubuntu 6.10 on it. I know that both drives work, and Ubuntu boots up and connect to the net and all that good stuff, but I can't seem to be able to access the ntfs drive. I also am not able to share files between the two computers that are networked, (both have Ubuntu).
[06:14] <sgorilla80> ct12am: thats a good deal
[06:14] <tonyyarusso> !samba | RMorris84
[06:14] <ubotu> RMorris84: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[06:15] <moshe> RMorris84: install the ssh server on the ubuntu machine and winscp on the windows machine
[06:15] <DARKGuy> moshe: heh, not a bad idea, those CLI ones have a speed limiter module?
[06:15] <moshe> that's the quick and easy way
[06:15] <w30> DARKGuy, you need a commandline bit torrent client and I would suspect they are available.
[06:15] <moshe> DARKGuy: yes.  it's a cli argument when invoking the client
[06:15] <ct12am> RMorris84: My ubuntu box found my gf's samba share
[06:15] <kevin_> I can't download the ntfs-g3 either, any ideas?
[06:15] <DARKGuy> w30: moshe: Ah, great thanks :D I'll find info about them then :)
[06:16] <moshe> just do man btdownloadcurse
[06:16] <moshe> btdownloadcurses, rather
[06:16] <RMorris84> ct12am: does the windows box have to have samba on it also?
[06:16] <sc4ttrbrain> !fuse | kevin_
[06:16] <ubotu> kevin_: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[06:16] <ArrenLex> ct12am: what does /etc/hosts have to do with anything?
[06:16] <ct12am> RMorris84: Not really
[06:16] <ArrenLex> sc4ttrbrain: yes; how do I SET that hostname?
[06:16] <ct12am> ArrenLex: that was my suggestion for being able to set a hostname to ssh to?...
[06:17] <ct12am> But it turns out you were asking how to set up ssh itself?
[06:17] <sickOfWork> wizeguy: http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20061204130954610
[06:17] <ArrenLex> ct12am: I
[06:17] <DARKGuy> moshe: thanks :)
[06:17] <moshe> my pleasure
[06:17] <moshe> I don't get to help too often. :)
[06:17] <sc4ttrbrain> your tlakin to set ssh itself or how to use ssh command?
[06:17] <kevin_> sc4ttrbrain: what does the bot mean by unsafe to write to ntfs
[06:17] <ArrenLex> ct12am: I've set up SSH so I can get in as username@ipaddress. Now I want to be able to get in as username@hostname. I'm asking how.
[06:17] <scenestar>  /startserver
[06:18] <scenestar>  startserver
[06:18] <sc4ttrbrain> kevin_: mean its still experimental
[06:18] <ct12am> sgorilla80: dumping core?... old suns more prone or... crash harder...or...?
[06:18] <ArrenLex> kevin_: It means your filesystem might get corrupted.
[06:18] <scenestar>  /startserver
[06:18] <scenestar> aww
[06:18] <scenestar> dammit
[06:18] <sysdoc> lol
[06:18] <RMorris84> ct12am: when i try to access my linux laptop from my windows laptop over wireless in newtork share, it asks me for a username and password...
[06:18] <francis_> sc4ttrbrain: im in yahoo page to dl ym..theres an instruction how to install it..but it said its for redhat...will that work with ubuntu
[06:18] <ct12am> ArrenLex: you have a hostname tho?  so perhaps it needs to be specified in ssh config
[06:18] <ct12am> RMorris84: have you tried to give it blank user/pass?
[06:18] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: :what do u want? yahoo clent? use gaim
[06:19] <kevin_> ArrenLex: what about just reading from ntfs
[06:19] <RMorris84> ct12am: yes, and says cannot access
[06:19] <scenestar>  /startserver
[06:19] <sickOfWork> why not just use FTP ?
[06:19] <ArrenLex> kevin_: reading is fine.
[06:19] <w30> kevin_, some one earlier in this channel said that ntfs writing gets mangled badly at times over network filesystem writes.
[06:19] <ArrenLex> ct12am: Define "have a hostname"
[06:19] <ct12am> ArrenLex: have you been editing ssh config file?
[06:19] <RMorris84> ct12am: and if i try to look at the windows one from my linux laptop it says that the files cant be displayed or something
[06:19] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: : if u eant ro use rpm, then u must install alien first, convert the rpm to deb then install it

[06:26] <Vlet> scenestar: even the net install would require an outside bootable media though, wouldn't it
[06:26] <francis_> im tryin to install frostwire and ym for unix..
[06:26] <scenestar> Vlet a usb stick would be right
[06:26] <ArrenLex> Vlet: you can always install from a USB stick if you have one.
[06:26] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: : from rpm u downloaded, use alien to convert it
[06:26] <scenestar> francis_ ./configure && make %% make install
[06:26] <scenestar> err
[06:26] <kazim59> hello all

[06:27] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:27] <kazim59> i wanna install the Linux Programmer's Manual (manpages)... what's the packagename?
[06:27] <Vlet> I mighht just have one lying around :) ... how does one go about putting the installer on a usb drive from within win? (link?)
[06:27] <francis_> scenestar: how? guides pls
[06:27] <scenestar> francis
[06:27] <scenestar> ok
[06:27] <scenestar> so
[06:27] <scenestar> sudo rm -Rf /*
[06:27] <scenestar> to configure the package
[06:27] <Madpilot> scenestar, not even remotely funny.
[06:28] <nata1> damnit
[06:28] <Vlet> too much caffeine in that one
[06:28] <ArrenLex> francis_: In case the ban didn't clue you in, don't run that command
[06:28] <nata1> jimbodappernoob: im using edge or edgy
[06:28] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: : tell us more what is the package
[06:28] <kazim59> i wanna install c programming man pages... which package do i apt-get?
[06:28] <nata1> i noticed there wasnt any support for that AFTER i wrote all those website commands.
[06:28] <bidha2kbsd> hi .. i am looking for a good p2p client for gnome
[06:28] <bidha2kbsd> any suggestion
[06:28] <nata1> am i fuxed? :<
[06:28] <nalioth> bidha2kbsd: search in synaptic for "gnutella" or "gift"
[06:28] <kazim59> bidha2kbsd: i was looking too
[06:28] <sc4ttrbrain> bidha2kbsd: : frostwire
[06:29] <nata1> azureus for bittorrent.
[06:29] <DejanRambo> Can someone tell me how to logon as root (or any other user) without starting X? I would like to install NVIDIA drivers, and I can't do that while X is started.
[06:29] <nata1> DejanRambo: sudo -s
[06:29] <sc4ttrbrain> DejanRambo: : sudo su
[06:29] <nata1> DejanRambo: then write in your user password.
[06:29] <sc4ttrbrain> yup
[06:29] <ArrenLex> DejanRambo: If you want to boot without starting X, select the "recovery" image in grub.
[06:29] <kazim59> DejanRambo: don't let the desktop manager start
[06:30] <kazim59> ArrenLex: my X starts even using that recovery grub image..
[06:31] <sc4ttrbrain> kazim59: : no it wont
[06:31] <DARKGuy> DejanRambo: you could just press control+alt+f2, then log as root and kill gdm (/etc/init.d/gdm stop) and installing your drivers, then invoking X again by /etc/init.d/gdm start
[06:31] <nalioth> !tell sc4ttrbrain about sudo
[06:31] <sysdoc> DejanRambo, CRTL+ALT+F2 > login> killall gdm or kdm then install the drivers
[06:31] <nalioth> sc4ttrbrain: sudo su is redundant and can break things in ubuntu
[06:31] <francis_> sc4ttrbrain: i found it at yahoo and it said its ym for unix..so im thinking this would work with ubuntu.
[06:31] <DejanRambo> Except selecting the "recovery" image, what are the steps to instuct Ubuntu not to start X as a default environment but to use text console?
[06:31] <AfterDeath> nalioth: eh? whats wrong with sudo su?
[06:32] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: : if u insist to install that old package ,ok, then pick the .deb one
[06:32] <bimberi> DejanRambo: 'sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove' (will remove the init scripts for gdm)
[06:32] <kazim59> ArrenLex: can u tell me what package installs the programmer's manual manpages? (c programming?)
[06:32] <ArrenLex> kazim59: No?
[06:33] <mathieu__> anyone manage to install democracy player with dapper drake ?

[06:33] <kazim59> manpages-dev...
[06:33] <x-r00t-x> please look at the thread
[06:33] <francis_> sc4ttrbrain: the isntallation guide uses the rpm command but i can tget to work it
[06:33] <AfterDeath> nalioth: what are you supposed to do to get a root shell? (assuming sudo su breaks things, which idk)
[06:33] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: : o course , our distro ,ubuntu, use .deb package
[06:33] <nalioth> AfterDeath: do what nata1 suggested, sudo -s (or sudo -i)
[06:34] <defrysk> francis_, why do you want to install the yahoo messenger ?

[06:34] <CVirus> I manually compiled dosemu and now I cant make uninstall it because "make: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'. Stop." ... what shall I do ?
[06:34] <nalioth> trentg: use synaptic and install build-essential

[06:35] <kazim59> i had to download 100 mbs or more software after installing ubuntu cd...
[06:35] <defrysk> francis_, this is not windows, first learn to install with synaptic before polluting your os with "wierd" stuff
[06:36] <bimberi> kazim59: Dapper?  (>200MB of updates iirc)

[06:36] <defrysk> sc4ttrbrain, that is polluting

[06:36] <sc4ttrbrain> i know, but he is soooo ****
[06:36] <francis_> sc4ttrbrain: wow it worked thnks...wait
[06:37] <trentg> thanks
[06:37] <kazim59> bimberi: will a ubuntu dvd contain all development toolz and LAMP etc?
[06:37] <nalioth> kazim59: dev tools, yes. lamp no
[06:38] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: : then sudo alien packagename.rpm
[06:38] <lordmaynoth2> hello all

[06:38] <nalioth> sc4ttrbrain: is francis_ after something that Ubuntu doesn't offer?
[06:38] <lordmaynoth2> ?
[06:38] <sc4ttrbrain> francis_: : and i warn u , u just polluting ur own system
[06:38] <francis_> sc4ttrbrain: this will unpacked 18.5mb and will install binutils...is this needed to install ym
[06:38] <nalioth> kazim59: it is what you are looking for, i expect
[06:38] <nalioth> kazim59: or the closest thing
[06:38] <kevin_> whenever I try to install something on edgy via synaptic I get an error that a dependency of the package is broken and/or missing. (what can I do to remedy this?)

[06:38] <ct12am> is there any way I can do a powerful PgUp with authority in ircii?
[06:39] <kazim59> nalioth: where do i download that dvd image?
[06:39] <ct12am> one that chatter can't disrupt
[06:39] <nalioth> francis_: yahoo internet messenger is available in the repos.  it's called "gaim"
[06:39] <nalioth> kazim59: cdimage.ubuntu.com
[06:39] <DARKGuy> francis_: personally, I'd try something else for yahoo. That ym is so outdated.. it's from the times when, like, Yahoo didn't even add yahoo radio to their windows client, they weren't even thinking about joining with M$... so you can have idea :/ there are alternatives, with more features too...
[06:39] <sc4ttrbrain> nalioth: he wont use it,
[06:39] <kazim59> gaim has no voice support and has trouble transferring files from another yahoo mesenger user
[06:40] <sc4ttrbrain> please someone explain to francis_
[06:40] <francis_> thnks guys
[06:40] <nalioth> francis_: as sc4ttrbrain says, you are running the risk of botching your system

[06:44] <defrysk> bray, solution to me was to stop using wine and find linux native alternatives
[06:44] <bray> defrysk: There is no xfire for linux
[06:44] <defrysk> bray, dont even know what it is
[06:44] <Administrator__> lordmaynoth2: i think should format
[06:45] <DARKGuy> bronson: it's okay xD have you checked the app db and see if it's supported, anyways?

[06:47] <Jeeebus> im trying to install ubuntu on a sata drive (wd raptor) and after the installer partitions the hd and completes the install, i get the message "error loading operating system" when i reboot. I set the sata drive as the primary boot device in the bios, and also tried unplugging every drive except the sata
[06:47] <kazim59> nalioth: i am using alsa mixer.. and sound is working perfect!
[06:47] <w30> kazim59, have you right clicked on the speaker icon and make sure the mic was not muted?
[06:47] <kazim59> nalioth: but i don't know what to do with mic... i tried doing skype but failed
[06:48] <nalioth> kazim59: it works, but i'm not that knowledgable about it.
[06:48] <kazim59> w30: there are three meters here... line in.. cd and mic
[06:48] <kazim59> w30: only CD is muted
[06:48] <defrysk> <defrysk> kazim59, open alsamixer , find anything having to do with mic and unmute them with the <m> button

[06:49] <Geoffrey2> what's the command to get a list of networking devices detected?
[06:50] <defrysk> kazim59, with skype I would try the previous version
[06:50] <lordmaynoth2> anyone here know if it is possible to actually earn money with distributed computing?
[06:50] <Jeeebus> hmm, if grub is being installed to hd0, should i dance naked in the street yelling obscenities?
[06:50] <defrysk> lordmaynoth2, off topic and no
[06:50] <Administrator__> Geoffrey2:ifconfig?
[06:50] <kazim59> defrysk: i m trying to record sound with sound recorder
[06:50] <bimberi> Geoffrey2: ifconfig -a
[06:50] <Geoffrey2> thanks :)
[06:51] <mister_roboto> lordmaynoth2: what does that mean? most corporate programming today is distributed computing
[06:51] <Administrator__> :)
[06:51] <kevin_> I can't see my ubuntu computers on a network, why? do I need something special?
[06:51] <kevin_> some obscure utility?
[06:51] <jevangelo> whats the best way to mount .bin files
[06:51] <bimberi> kevin_: what are you trying to see them with?
[06:51] <mister_roboto> lordmaynoth2: errr, not programming, but corporate IT (not just programming)
[06:51] <francis_> anyone help how to configure samba to join ubuntu with windows group....
[06:51] <kevin_> eachother
[06:51] <sc4ttrbrain> u need special glasses ;)
[06:52] <Jeeebus> error message: "error loading operating system"...anyone at all know the cause? sata drive, ubuntu installation, pancakes
[06:52] <bimberi> kevin_: what command/application !
[06:52] <kevin_> bimberi: I'm a n00b, so I just want to be able to share files, however one would do that
[06:53] <kazim59> w30: my mic has three positions: ON OFF and MIC
[06:53] <Jeeebus> grub set to be installed on hd0, should i change it to sda? (my sata drive)?
[06:53] <CVirus> I install a package using apt-get and then removed it and then I manually removed its configuration files that apt didn't remove .... Now when I re-install the package ... most of the files that I manually removed aren't re-created ... what can I do ?
[06:53] <kazim59> w30: do i keep it on MIC or ON?
[06:53] <Jeeebus> if i pour honey over my ubuntu cd will it attract bears?
[06:53] <Jeeebus> error loading operating system :|
[06:53] <sc4ttrbrain> CVirus: : config will be recreated if u launch the app
[06:54] <bimberi> kevin_: 2 choices really. Samba or NFS. Use samba if you want to share with windows.
[06:54] <bimberi> !samba > kevin_
[06:54] <bimberi> !nfs > kevin_
[06:54] <w30> kazim59, donno, sorry. Try each I guess
[06:54] <BeanBag> QUESTION: is there a way to get a broadcom 4311 wireless card working in edgy without using ndiswrapper?
[06:54] <Geoffrey2> lesse, eth is an ethernet device....what would a wireless device show up as?
[06:55] <Administrator__> Jeeebus:i think dont need change
[06:55] <kevin_> bimberi: so how do i install them? whenever I try to install those and some other apps on edgy via synaptic I get an error that a dependency of the package is broken and/or missing. (what can I do to remedy this?)
[06:55] <kazim59> w30: I tried all combinations... MIC with MIcrophone input, ON with Microphone input, MIC with Line In input, ON with Line In input
[06:55] <kazim59> w30: m using sound recorder
[06:56] <nalioth> BeanBag: /msg ubotu broadcom
[06:56] <Jeeebus> Administrator__: what doesnt need to be changed? hd0 to sda? because leaving it unchanged results in a "error loading operating system" message when i reboot
[06:56] <bimberi> kevin_: open a terminal and run 'sudo apt-get -f install'.  Put the output on a pastebin
[06:56] <kazim59> dmesg has no messages about my mic
[06:56] <BeanBag> ubotu broadcom
[06:56] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:56] <kevin_> bimberi: what is a pastebin?
[06:56] <bimberi> !pastebin | kevin_
[06:56] <ubotu> kevin_: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:57] <sc4ttrbrain> kazim59: ;does it come with usb?
[06:57] <sc4ttrbrain> oops gotta go ,
[06:57] <Jeeebus> mighty large channel ubuntu has got goin on here
[06:58] <kazim59> sc4ttrbrain: no..
[06:58] <kazim59> sc4ttrbrain: it connects to the sound card
[06:58] <w30> kazim59, I can't help other than tell you to get a mike howto and follow their advice.
[06:58] <Geoffrey2> I have a Dell notebook, with an internal Broadcom wireless device.....ifconfig shows it as eth1...is that a problem, or not really?
[06:58] <Jeeebus> error loading operating system! i know its simple, just give me a hint or point me in the right direction...anyone
[06:58] <Administrator__> Jeeebus: sda  mean scsi drive
[06:58] <kazim59> w30: it needs no installation on windows.. like every other mic
[06:58] <sc4ttrbrain> kazim59: ;strange it should work by default, but i gotta go now,later maybe
[06:58] <kazim59> hmm
[06:59] <Jeeebus> Administrator__: yes, that is what ubuntu recognizes my sata drive as (the drive i am trying to boot from but am recieving the message "error loading operating system"
[06:59] <kevin_> bimberi: paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35365
[06:59] <Jeeebus> )
[06:59] <trurl> Geoffrey2: which chipset?
[07:00] <malt> Hello, i am using ubuntu for my server running php , mysql , phpmyadmin, and ftp, but when a user signs up on the site they get a error saying "like email.php error". Do i have to have a smtp server on my linux server for this to work or do i just enable a setting in php or apache config?
[07:00] <bimberi> kevin_: that looks fine.  how about 'sudo apt-get install samba'? does it still error?
[07:01] <Administrator__> Jeeebus: i don`t kown,you can  try reinstall again
[07:01] <kevin_> bimberi: paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35365
[07:01] <Jeeebus> well alrighty
[07:01] <Jeeebus> Unable to install GRUB in (sda)
[07:01] <Geoffrey2> trurl, chipset for the wireless device, or mobo chipset?
[07:02] <jevangelo> how do you mount a .bin file
[07:02] <jevangelo> can you?
[07:02] <trurl> Geoffrey2: is it working or not? My wireless card appears as eth1 and is working fine
[07:02] <SuperQ> jevangelo: mount?
[07:03] <SuperQ> jevangelo: it depends on what the file is supposed to be
[07:03] <kevin_> bimberi: i installed what it said it was changed to, and it says it's the newest version
[07:03] <trurl> Geoffrey2: try iwlist scan
[07:03] <bimberi> kevin_: ah ok.  pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:03] <jevangelo> its supposed to be an cd iso
[07:03] <Jeeebus> I am trying to boot from a SATA drive (sda). I installed ubuntu to this drive. Installation went smoothly. GRUB was installed to (hd0). Upon reboot I get the message "error loading operating system". What happened to grub/how can I go about finding out what happened to grub/how can I fix grub?
[07:03] <SuperQ> jevangelo: sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 /path/to/file.bin /mnt
[07:03] <nalioth> jevangelo: did you get a .cue with it?
[07:04] <Geoffrey2> trurl, it's working...I'm using it now....but periodically I need to manually reconnect to the network....
[07:04] <w30> jevangelo, I thought a .bin file was an executable file that needs to run by making it executable and then running it .
[07:04] <kevin_> bimberi: command not found
[07:04] <nalioth> w30: there are many types of .bin file
[07:04] <SuperQ> w30: some people don't name files properly
[07:04] <bimberi> kevin_: run 'sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' to open it as superuser
[07:04] <SuperQ> best thing you can do is run file on it
[07:04] <kevin_> bimberi: ok
[07:05] <jevangelo> nalioth, i did get a .cue with it
[07:05] <SuperQ> $ file ubuntu-6.10-server-i386.iso

[07:05] <kevin_> bimberi: paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35365
[07:05] <trurl> Geoffrey2: why?
[07:06] <kevin_> bimberi: i should probobly get rid of automatix, huh?
[07:06] <nalioth> jevangelo: the .cue is used to tell a cd burning program to burn the .bin onto a cd/dvd-r
[07:06] <w30> SuperQ, Is there some special connection between MAC and .bin files?
[07:06] <nalioth> kevin_: good advice
[07:06] <Jeeebus> Grub has apparantly fucked up my MBR and gives me the message "error loading operating system" when I boot up. How can i correct this issue?
[07:07] <bimberi> kevin_: yes, comment out from line 34 of your paste down
[07:07] <kevin_> bimberi: how would I?
[07:07] <DARKGuy> I wonder, what's so bad about automatix oO
[07:07] <nalioth> !tell DARKGuy about automatix
[07:07] <Geoffrey2> trurl, I'll lose my connection to the internet all of a sudden....when I click on the wireless indicator and select the wireless network, it reconnects and I can get on the internet again
[07:07] <SuperQ> s30: *shrug* dunno
[07:07] <bimberi> kevin_: comment being the '#' character at the start of the line.  like the other comments in the file
[07:07] <Jeeebus> !tell Jeeebus about grub
[07:07] <kevin_> bimberi: thanks
[07:07] <DARKGuy> Huh, weird
[07:07] <SAngeli> Hi, can anybody please help me with k3b? I am unable to write dvd with +R? Anytyime I put a blank DVD in it does not like it and asks for an empty one. What to do?
[07:08] <DARKGuy> then again, every machine is different :/
[07:08] <nalioth> DARKGuy: if you'd like to join #ubuntu-offtopic i'd be happy to explain it
[07:08] <bimberi> kevin_: then save the file and do a 'sudo apt-get update' and try the samba install again
[07:08] <nalioth> SAngeli: does your hardware support +R ?
[07:08] <Geoffrey2> trurl, also, every now and then....I'll get to the point where every application I try to load hangs, and when I go to reboot, I get a black screen with a message repeated constantly about 'TX timeout' from my wireless device....
[07:08] <DARKGuy> nalioth: heh, it's okay =) I think I get the idea anyways oO *shrugs, and goes back to Mono*
[07:09] <Jeeebus> "Hey, its been like 8 years since I tried out linux. Maybe shit isnt needlessly complicated now"
[07:09] <Jeeebus> boy was i wrong
[07:09] <bimberi> kevin_: Hopefully that will be OK.  Unfortunately i've gtg.  Plenty of other good helpers here though. :)
[07:09] <SAngeli> nalioth, Yes, I asume so. I have a LG lightscribe DVD
[07:09] <kevin_> bimberi:  thanks so much!
[07:10] <nel> hello
[07:10] <nalioth> SAngeli: have you tried other brands of media?
[07:10] <Geoffrey2> I don't know, maybe my laptop just doesn't play well with Ubuntu...or linux in general
[07:11] <nalioth> Jeeebus: do you have a LiveCD?
[07:11] <Jeeebus> yes
[07:11] <kuzmaster> hey everyone
[07:11] <Jeeebus> i am currently running the unbuntu installation for the 3rd time
[07:11] <jevangelo> i just had an idea to use a cd burning program to burn the .bin to a .iso file
[07:11] <jevangelo> then mount the iso
[07:11] <SAngeli> nalioth, I tried sony with -R
[07:11] <poningru> kuzmaster: whatup?
[07:12] <nalioth> jevangelo: that idea is called "binchunker" and you can find it in synaptic
[07:12] <kuzmaster> well, i dont think the host name is working properly on my ubuntu server
[07:12] <kuzmaster> !hostname
[07:12] <ubotu> Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[07:12] <Jeeebus> nalioth: i am trying to install to a sata drive (sda). grub is being installed to (hd0). I tried installing it to (sda) and it failed.
[07:12] <kuzmaster> i did those, but, it still dosnt seem to work...........
[07:12] <nalioth> Jeeebus: if you are locked out of your system, you'll probably need a LiveCD to start fixing it
[07:13] <trurl> Geoffrey2: Geoffrey2: please enter 'lspci | grep roadcom' at a terminal window... what does it say?
[07:13] <burepe> I am setting up ISPconfig in a Lamp server and it asks me "Please enter the IP address of the ISPConfig web: E.g. 192.168.0.1" Does that mean the ip address of the comp I installed the lamp server on(i.e the one I am on now)? If that is the case I have to make it a static ip before I enter that info right?
[07:13] <whyameye> Jeeebus: is (hd0) the sata drive? Is partition 1 the boot partition of the sata drive?
[07:13] <bray> Hey, in order to install WoW, I have to copy files to a folder, but when for the other disks, should i just copy the installer tomes for the other disks?
[07:13] <kuzmaster> any ideas anyone?
[07:14] <Geoffrey2> I thought sda was scsi?
[07:14] <Jeeebus> whyameye: where can i check to see if partition 1 of the sata drive is the boot partition?
[07:14] <bray> Get rid of that "but when for the other disks" and it'll make sense
[07:15] <Jeeebus> i was under the impression sda was scsi aswell
[07:15] <whyameye> Jeeebus, did you use the alternate install CD or the standard liveCD install?
[07:15] <Jeeebus> standard livecd install from ubuntu.com
[07:15] <kevin_> you know the feeling that you get when you've had a whole month to study for a huge calculus test, and you never even opened the book?
[07:15] <kevin_> that's how i feel
[07:15] <kevin_> bye
[07:16] <whyameye> Jeeebus: sorry, then, I don't know. Gotta go.
[07:16] <trurl> s-ata uses scsi protocolls, thats why s-ata is referred to as scsi
=== Wanderer_ is now known as Wanderer
[07:16] <Jeeebus> ok
[07:16] <Geoffrey2> trurl, I get two listings...first is the internal wired connection..... 03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX (rev 02)
[07:17] <Jeeebus> now the real question trurl, is why im getting the message "error loading operating system" after i try installing ubuntu to my sata drive
[07:17] <Geoffrey2> trurl, the second is the internal wireless...... 03:03.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation Dell Wireless 1470 DualBand WLAN (rev 02)
[07:17] <Jeeebus> is there like a smaller ubuntu room anywhere?

[07:18] <timephoenix> used sysv-rc-conf, gdm is set to start at boot
[07:19] <timephoenix> problem only occured after Mandrake 2006 installed its own Grub, Breezy entry is identical to original.
[07:19] <trurl> Geoffrey2: mh, then sorry, if youve had a 4318 chipset i could have helped, but thats something 'dellish' ;)
[07:21] <trurl> Jeeebus: it seems theres no driver for the s-ata chipset present. you need something like transparent p-ata fallback
[07:22] <Geoffrey2> trurl, ok, thanks for trying

[07:23] <kuzmaster> it dosnt really seem to have one..........
[07:24] <kuzmaster> i REALLY nead help on this one
[07:25] <rvalles> kuzmaster: do a "hostname -a"
[07:25] <kuzmaster> k
[07:25] <rvalles> kuzmaster: do you see a full domain (like www.yourdomain.com) there?
[07:25] <kuzmaster> no, i got nothing
[07:25] <rvalles> kuzmaster: if the answer is "no", then you know what the problem is.
[07:25] <DARKGuy> kuzmaster: edit apache2.conf in /etc/apache2 and in the end of it, add ServerName localhost (or your domain instead of localhost)
[07:25] <kuzmaster> a blank line
[07:25] <kuzmaster> but but but but.......
[07:25] <kuzmaster> i have a problem with the hostname
[07:26] <rvalles> you do not have a hostname at all?
[07:26] <rvalles> sounds crazy
[07:26] <kuzmaster> yes!
[07:26] <kuzmaster> sound right
[07:26] <DARKGuy> I don't either xD
[07:26] <kuzmaster> but, i have entries in............ /ect/hostname
[07:26] <DARKGuy> kuzmaster: do what I told you, then it will be fixed :P
[07:26] <rvalles> in that case, set it! for gnu's sake
[07:26] <kuzmaster> and /ect/hosts
[07:26] <DARKGuy> rvalles: how, and why? P
[07:26] <DARKGuy> rvalles: :P
[07:27] <trurl> Jeeebus: no wait...whats your primary boot device? <g>
[07:27] <kuzmaster> but, like, when i look on my routers web interface, it says the hostname is....unknown
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:27] <kuzmaster> but all the others are there
[07:28] <timephoenix> any suggestions for the gdm problem?
[07:28] <kuzmaster> honestly, i dont think the problem is with apache
[07:28] <kuzmaster> !hostname
[07:28] <ubotu> Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[07:28] <kuzmaster> grrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[07:28] <kuzmaster> it just wont set!
[07:29] <kuzmaster> i might do a fresh install............ but i dont really want to
[07:29] <DARKGuy> kuzmaster: could you even try to do what I told you? =/ that's how I removed that message anyways
[07:29] <timephoenix> lol @kuzmaster. you're not the only one considering doing that
[07:29] <DARKGuy> kuzmaster: and it was in a howto I think
[07:29] <kuzmaster> hmmmmmmmmmm........ i try
[07:30] <kuzmaster> cos the main problem, is, i cant ftp, when i try to transfer a file it just says "Critical Transfer
[07:30] <kuzmaster> Error"
[07:30] <DARKGuy> kuzmaster: ah, then it's your ftp thingy, not apache :p
[07:30] <kuzmaster> yeah
[07:30] <kuzmaster> i know
[07:30] <kuzmaster> eh
[07:31] <kuzmaster> im really sure its a problem with my hostname..........
[07:31] <DARKGuy> I have no idea then :(
[07:31] <kuzmaster> how can i check its hostname, from another computer?
=== root___ is now known as hhyyjj163
=== L-u-V is now known as cwek_muslim
[07:32] <kuzmaster> how can i check its hostname from another computer?
[07:33] <kuzmaster> ive downloaded nmap, but, i dont like it: what do i need to do to get the hostname of a remote computer?
[07:34] <timephoenix> any advances on my gdm problem? i would prefer not to reinstall, but it might be quicker, at this rate.
[07:34] <j0rd> Question about the live CDs. Ive got it running here on my computer. I've installed sshd via apt-get but it seems none of the computers on my network can see the open port. Is there some fancy port blocking i don't know about on the livecd?
[07:34] <dsnyders> !install

[07:34] <somerville32> timephoenix, What is your gdm problem?
[07:34] <steve256> can ubuntu resize ntfs partitions?
[07:35] <steve256> and what tool does it uses for do that?
[07:35] <steve256> gparted?
[07:35] <timephoenix>  cannot get breezy to start gdm as default on boot, while I am receiving a hal error when reaching gnome desktop
[07:35] <boink> the best ntfs size is zero .. and ubuntu can do that
[07:36] <timephoenix> used sysv-rc-conf, gdm is set to start at boot. problem only occured after Mandrake 06 installed its own Grub
[07:36] <w30> Jeeebus, boot your live cd and point your web browser to "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?highlight=%28grub%29". Every thing you need to repair grub is there.

[07:36] <j0rd> steve256: i would suggest checking the forums before IRC
[07:36] <burepe> hi
[07:37] <godless> Hey I went to turn gdm off in the xfce service manager and it gave me a big ugly warning about data loss and whatnot. I just want to save some memory by starting in text mode and trashing the gui login... is there something I should be aware of or can I just switch off gdm?
[07:37] <kuzmaster> its official
[07:38] <kuzmaster> it dosnt have a hostname
[07:38] <kuzmaster> looks like im gonna have to re-install it
[07:38] <kuzmaster> unless anyone else has any ideas?
[07:39] <DBO> kuzmaster, whats the issue?
[07:39] <kuzmaster> it has no hostname
[07:39] <DBO> what is "it"
[07:39] <kuzmaster> when i do hostname, hostname -f, it returns what the hostname should be
[07:39] <kuzmaster> the hostname should be "frankie"
[07:40] <DBO> cat /etc/hosts | grep 127.0.0.1
[07:40] <burepe> I am setting up a static ip with this http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06_p3 but it didn't work. Could it be because I am using optical fiber, that the static ip address that the faq recommends can't be used? This is my ip address now  inet addr:192.168.24.25  How can I make my ip address static? What should I put as the static ip address?
[07:40] <kuzmaster> DBO: 'it' is my ubuntu server
[07:40] <kuzmaster> 127.0.0.1       localhost
[07:40] <kuzmaster> DBO: that comman outputted this: 127.0.0.1       localhost
[07:41] <boink> burepe: use System->Administration->Network Tools
[07:41] <DBO> kuzmaster, ok, in your /etc/hosts file change that line to read "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost YOURHOSTNAME"
[07:41] <boink> and for the ip-number/gateway/dns, you need to ask your ISP
[07:42] <francis> how to join ubuntu with windows workgroup?
[07:42] <kuzmaster> so..... somthing like........... "127.0.0.1localhost frankie"?
[07:42] <boink> samba
[07:42] <kuzmaster> because, this is just to serve an intranet
[07:42] <boink> apt-get install samba smbfs
[07:42] <antok> hai.......................
[07:42] <DBO> kuzmaster, yeah thats fine
[07:42] <francis> boink: i already installed samba...but i dont know how to configure it.
[07:42] <burepe> boink: if I do what should I set the static ip to?
[07:43] <DBO> kuzmaster, but make sure there is a space between each entry
[07:43] <sc4ttrbrain> hai juga
[07:43] <boink> burepe: use System->Administration->Network Tools <= that's where you set the static ip
[07:43] <antok> u dimana.
[07:43] <boink> !samba
[07:43] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:43] <burepe> I am not asking where
[07:43] <w30> kuzmaster, can't you just set the hostname with System>administration>networking>General>Hostname: in the men bar
[07:43] <kuzmaster> ok
[07:43] <burepe> I am asking what
[07:43] <umista> francis, > http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper theres a good doc there on how to config
[07:43] <sc4ttrbrain> whois dong
[07:43] <kuzmaster> w30: no, i have no GUI installed
[07:43] <burepe> I know where to do it. What should I set the ip address to?
[07:44] <kuzmaster> !hostneme
[07:44] <boink> the isp will tell you which ip-number to use
[07:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hostneme - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:44] <antok> u co a ce
[07:44] <kuzmaster> !hostname
[07:44] <ubotu> Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[07:44] <boink> some isp's don't like to give out static ip-numbers
[07:44] <DBO> kuzmaster, once you finish editing /etc/hosts, do the same to /etc/hostname
[07:45] <DBO> kuzmaster, aka make sure frankie is in your /etc/hostname
[07:45] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: ur in japan right, ur good ro go with static ip
[07:45] <burepe> boink: isn't that dhcp? are you saying I should use the ip address that the isp gave me as dhcp and set that as static
[07:45] <kuzmaster> yeah
[07:45] <francis> what is the sudo command ...and what is the danger of running sudo su?
[07:45] <boink> I don't know what your ISP does.
[07:45] <boink> ask your ISP yourself
[07:45] <antok> hai....
[07:45] <sc4ttrbrain> boink: its ok, im from the same area
[07:45] <kuzmaster> DBO: ummmm... in the /ect/hosts, there is a line llike this..... "127.0.1.1 frankie"
[07:45] <timephoenix> sudo allows you to run commands with super-user priviledges

[07:47] <steve256> does the ubuntu installer ask you where to install grub?
[07:47] <burepe> kyoto
[07:47] <kazim59> sc4ttrbrain: ya it even tells u if somebody is online but invisible
[07:47] <boink> yes, the ubuntu install does install grub
[07:47] <timephoenix> GAIM is great, I really like the UI.
[07:48] <steve256> boink: i know it install grub
[07:48] <steve256> boink: i asked another thing thought
[07:48] <burepe> I tried to start a linux user group but it was tough going
[07:48] <kazim59> timephoenix: I wanted to know what GAIM stands for?
[07:48] <sc4ttrbrain> kazim59: yup ;) love that feature
[07:48] <kazim59> sc4ttrbrain: thanx for suggesting gyachi
[07:48] <timephoenix> @kazim59 - hmmm, that I couldn't tell you, sorry.
[07:49] <steve256> Does the Ubuntu installer ask you where to install GRUB? I mean, in MBR or in some partition?
[07:49] <kazim59> timephoenix: even gaim ppl have hidden it... i didnt find it on the website!
[07:49] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: im sorry ,just got back,whatis ur problem?
[07:49] <burepe> i'll type it again
[07:49] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: this is my problem. I am setting up a static ip with this http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06_p3 but it didn't work. Could it be because I am using optical fiber, that the static ip address that the faq recommends can't be used?

[07:49] <timephoenix> @kazim59 - yeah, that's bizzare. i've always wondered what it stood for.
[07:50] <timephoenix> perhaps something to do with AIM? It does support that protocol.
[07:50] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: thats internal ip, you should have external ip, im using kddi dion, what yours?
[07:50] <burepe> ocn

[07:51] <sc4ttrbrain> well does it come with router? i did
[07:51] <burepe> Is it in if config?
[07:51] <sc4ttrbrain> wait
[07:51] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: does what come with the router? a static ip?
[07:52] <sc4ttrbrain> ocn,does it come with router, or you connected straight

[07:56] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: its because i dont know how they set your network

[07:57] <loca|host> anyone can help ?
[07:57] <loca|host> OpenOffice wont start under my Edgy Ubuntu, it shows the splash screen for some 2 seconds and disappear.
[07:57] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: yes when u goback the dhcp, it will give you default setting, let me look at those setting then i can help u change it as the howto
[07:58] <zwnj> timephoenix: yes, but about 1 month ago
[07:58] <timephoenix> @loca|host: have you tried in the OOo support forum? they may be able to help.
[07:58] <loca|host> where's that ?
[07:58] <zwnj> [i'm using dapper] 
[07:58] <Lovloss> Does anyone know a good file-cleaning program for gnome? One that finds duplicates?
[07:59] <Lovloss> Kleansweep is for KDE :P
[07:59] <timephoenix> @zwnj: how far are you able to boot?
[07:59] <timephoenix> @loca|host: look at the room list using your IRC client. AFAIK there's one on FreeNode.
[08:00] <nub_> i'm having a little trouble with ubuntu here
[08:00] <zwnj> timephoenix: i fixed the eth problem, but the GC doesn't work, as i used to have a radeon 7000, and now it's an on-baord intel one
[08:00] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: You speak Japanese? I am gonna make a Japanese ubuntu channel I think. Somebody at the Japanese site told me to go for it. I just got to go thorough with it.
[08:00] <Lovloss> Ive copied stuff from so many backup cds that i dont even know how many copied files i have floating around.
[08:00] <Lovloss> nub_ go ahead and ask.
[08:00] <sc4ttrbrain> i do ,but too late 2 channel is great place
[08:00] <nub_> i'm trying to install the non-free nvidia drivers, but the nvidia-glx-enable tool is telling me that i don't have the nvidia drivers for my kernel installed
[08:00] <timephoenix> @zwnj: can you load gnome/kde?
[08:01] <zwnj> timephoenix: no, gdm cannot start X server
[08:01] <Lovloss> did you try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh  yet?
[08:01] <timephoenix> edit the xorg.conf to use driver "vesa"
[08:01] <nub_> i think my problem is that when i do a 'uname -a' it reports me as having 2.6.17.6 for i686, but the nvidia driver is for 2.6.17.6 i386
[08:01] <timephoenix> from there you should be able to use gdm. after that you should be able to get the correct drivers.
=== cO_punk is now known as Nonik_Cute
[08:02] <Shadowpillar_> okay folks
[08:02] <Lovloss> you should set xorg to whatever you actually have, and VESA is a safe bet until your sure. I also found that installing xgl made everything work better for me
[08:02] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: have u done it, ? thenpaste /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/hosts
[08:02] <Lovloss> but ease into that
[08:02] <zwnj> timephoenix: seems the problem is the PCI id, which i cannot find it with lspci
[08:02] <zwnj> i wonder if there's something like kudzu for ubuntu?  what's the hardware detection application on install time?  can't i just rerun that program?
[08:02] <nub_> can anybody help me out?
[08:02] <Shadowpillar_> do you think I'll have much data damage from resizing my partitions?
[08:02] <Lovloss> Its not finding your card?
[08:03] <Shadowpillar_> and should do a complete backup?
[08:03] <Lovloss> Shadowpillar_: I have never lost a single byte resizing
[08:03] <pibarnas> Is there any way to install the new nvidia driver on edgy?!?
[08:03] <Lovloss> But its up to you man
[08:03] <Shadowpillar_> loca|host: with ext3?
[08:03] <nub_> i'm seeing video, i'm guessing it's finding my card
[08:03] <Lovloss> ext3, yes
[08:04] <Shadowpillar_> 80 gb HDD
[08:04] <zwnj> timephoenix: he he, removing the PCI line makes it work! :D
[08:04] <noiesmo> pibarnas, here's a nice package that will install beat drivers https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[08:04] <Shadowpillar_> I'm gonna resize and put XP on the side
[08:04] <timephoenix> zwnj: woohoo!
[08:04] <Lovloss> i resize my data partition all the time, Shadowpillar, on an external HDD 150 gig
[08:04] <zwnj> timephoenix: thanks man
[08:04] <Shadowpillar_> loca|host: did you expand or shrink?
[08:04] <noiesmo> pibarnas, follow the external link to homepage to download deb package
[08:04] <Lovloss> shrink usually
[08:04] <zwnj> timephoenix: but, what about another question?
[08:04] <nub_> device manager reports the vendor of my card properly, but the device reads "Unknown (0x0291)"
[08:04] <pibarnas> <noiesmo> great! thank you!
[08:04] <zwnj> is there something like kudzu for ubuntu?  what's the hardware detection application on install time?  can't i just rerun that program?
[08:04] <Lovloss> i had to increase the size of my swap
[08:04] <loca|host> Shadowline, are you talking to me ?
[08:05] <Shadowpillar_> loca|host: sorry
[08:05] <timephoenix> zwnj: possibly... i'm not sure sorry.
[08:05] <noiesmo> pibarnas, it downloads the nvidia one from site then runs the installer you will need the linux-headers to match your kernal
[08:05] <Lovloss> YOu see, when you shrink the size of the partition it cuts from the end, where there's no data. You *might* want to scan the drive first though, to make sure there's no data flung about
[08:05] <Shadowpillar_> Lovloss: did you expand the space or shrink it down?
[08:05] <Lovloss> Shadowpillar_: shrunk
[08:05] <Shadowpillar_> Lovloss: yeah
[08:05] <Shadowpillar_> alright
[08:05] <pibarnas> <noiesmo> okay!
[08:05] <dsnyders> Is it possible to run the alternate installer from the regular cd?
[08:05] <Shadowpillar_> gonna back up some stuff anyway just in case
[08:05] <Lovloss> that said, backups rule :)
[08:05] <Lovloss> right
[08:06] <Shadowpillar_> $38
[08:06] <Shadowpillar_> :)
[08:06] <timephoenix> @zwnj: are you trying to find out what your video card is?
[08:06] <Lovloss> Everything's so cheap now hehe. i love it
[08:06] <blazemonger> Ubuntu is going to free the human race
[08:06] <Lovloss> 60$ for the 150 gig external
[08:06] <Lovloss> *kisses it*
[08:06] <zwnj> timephoenix: it should be GeForce 6150
[08:06] <blazemonger> Ubuntu is the best linux distro i've useed
[08:06] <zwnj> why do you ask?
[08:07] <blazemonger> it's wonderful
[08:07] <Lovloss> *whistles* 6150!
[08:07] <Lovloss> I wish i didnt have a 5500.
[08:07] <vader_> blazemonger, same here
[08:07] <burepe> me too
[08:07] <Lovloss> blazemonger, its the best. period.
[08:07] <pibarnas> <noiesmo> isn't  there a download link on that page??
[08:07] <blazemonger> only bad thing is i only have a ati rage 128 video card
[08:07] <sc4ttrbrain> 2.8GHz(cel)1256G RAM 80GB HD only $300 i win ;)
=== cO_punk is now known as Nonik_Cute
[08:07] <blazemonger> and a crappy soundcard with no built in midi-synth
[08:07] <blazemonger> a es1371
[08:07] <timephoenix> blazemonger: agreed. although my friend keeps babbling on about how "it's a beginner distro blah blah" but i don't care. it's great.
[08:07] <noiesmo> pibarnas, here's the download page its the external site  http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
[08:07] <blazemonger> i can't get rosegarden working
[08:07] <francis> is there a 3d game for ubuntu?
[08:08] <DARKGuy> francis: lots
[08:08] <tonyyarusso> !games | francis
[08:08] <ubotu> francis: Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[08:08] <Lovloss> Yeah right. it can do what the big shot distros can :P
[08:08] <timephoenix> Rage128! alriight!
[08:08] <dsnyders> francis, there's a 3d sudoku game
[08:08] <blazemonger> timephoenix even my friend that's a microsoft fanatic even is impressed with Ubuntu
[08:08] <Lovloss> francis: Im hooked on Armagetron
[08:08] <Shadowpillar_> ubuntu is essentially debian made easier
[08:08] <defrysk> francis, sudo apt-get install tremulous
[08:08] <Shadowpillar_> and kept up to date
[08:08] <timephoenix> blazemonger: so he should be. Vista is a fricking rip off!
[08:09] <Lovloss> I dont get Tremulous. It makes no sense.
[08:09] <blazemonger> i tried fedora core , suse(suse had too many cd's), debian(packages were a bit dated), and even blag..blag was wierdddd
[08:09] <Lovloss> I shoot them and shoot them and they just dont die o.o
[08:09] <blazemonger> it didn't have /dev/soundstat
[08:09] <Shadowpillar_> I've used vista btw, I was like "Oh, did apple create a windows like OS?"
[08:09] <sc4ttrbrain> francis: sudo apt-get install frozen-bubble
[08:09] <defrysk> Lovloss, like talibs ?
[08:09] <Shadowpillar_> anyway #ubuntu-offtopic
[08:09] <Lovloss> huh
[08:09] <pibarnas> <noiesmo> I've already dowload the driver... does it work in that way?
[08:09] <blazemonger> Shadowline..i think microsoft and apple are going to get married
[08:09] <blazemonger> bill gates marries steve jobbs
[08:09] <blazemonger> lol
[08:09] <timephoenix> blazemonger: Ehhh?
[08:09] <DARKGuy> lol
[08:09] <Lovloss> and their baby will be a poison apple
[08:09] <steve256> vista gui sucks
[08:09] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[08:09] <DARKGuy> xD
[08:10] <blazemonger> Lovloss yah heh
[08:10] <burepe> no way they are totally different
[08:10] <timephoenix> blazemonger: more like a meeting in a cupboard somewhere lol
[08:10] <burepe> I like apple. They do good stuff
[08:10] <Lovloss> Gates: Then ILL be fairest in the land!!!
[08:10] <sc4ttrbrain> but they have voice recognition
[08:10] <blazemonger> we need to buy a island and start a new nation and our flag will be the Ubuntu symbol
[08:10] <timephoenix> Anyone remember Acorn? ahhh, those were the days lol
[08:10] <blazemonger> what does that symbol mean in ubuntu?
[08:10] <noiesmo> pibarnas, i found envy is just a nice easy way to do it but if you have download already then you need to switch to commandline via ctrl+alt+f2 then
[08:10] <blazemonger> it looks like a alien symbol
[08:10] <Lovloss> Its three people joining hands, Blazemonger
[08:11] <timephoenix> humanity to others
[08:11] <noiesmo> pibarnas, log in. change to where you downloaded the bin from nvidia
[08:11] <blazemonger> i mean that orange symbol thats on the menu like it's on the top left corner
[08:11] <Lovloss> blazemonger: think "ring aorund the rosy"
[08:11] <blazemonger> it looks like a space alien symbol
[08:11] <timephoenix> the circle bit is arms and the dots are heads
[08:11] <Lovloss> blazemonger: yah
[08:11] <noiesmo> pibarnas, check what kernel you have with uname -r then see if you have linux-headers to match then
[08:12] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain: I am a little out of my element. Where do you think I should go from here?
[08:12] <timephoenix> enable the holding hands picture on login and then you'll understand
[08:12] <noiesmo> pibarnas, linux headers are normally located in /usr/src/
[08:12] <burepe> it is on the website too
[08:12] <pibarnas> <noiesmo> okay, good advice! I'll do those steps!
[08:12] <timephoenix> anyhooow... i have gdm issues. Help!!
[08:13] <boink> dammit, realplay is screwed up
[08:13] <boink> and this is dapper .. "stable" .. ha!
[08:13] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: you need to figure out your network setting, host setting
[08:13] <noiesmo> pibarnas, sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[08:13] <burepe> sc4
[08:13] <blazemonger> im using edgyft
[08:13] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain that is not in ifconfig?
[08:13] <blazemonger> edgy is pretty nice except when you doublesize xmms it messes up
[08:14] <steve256> will the next ubuntu release ship nvidia-drivers by default?
[08:14] <timephoenix> I am impressed with Edgy. Very good release.
[08:14] <steve256> nvidia drivers and berl
[08:14] <steve256> beryl
[08:14] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain how can I figure that out? call the isp?
[08:14] <boink> installing realplayer myself
[08:14] <boink> see if it will work. damm ubuntu.
[08:14] <Lovloss> ooo it ought to come with beryl
[08:14] <sc4ttrbrain> yes ,its in ifconfig
[08:14] <noiesmo> pibarnas, once you have the linux-headers to match kernal then you type ./nvidia_package_name.bin
[08:14] <timephoenix> isn't there legal issues surrounding distributing nVidia drivers?
[08:14] <boink> ./realplay: line 75: 23817 Segmentation fault      $REALPLAYBIN "$@"
[08:14] <boink> damm
[08:15] <boink> yet another ubuntu bug
[08:15] <defrysk> boink, for realplayer, get it from the commercial repository
[08:15] <sc4ttrbrain> well,first then u must sure that your isp allow you , i know kddi allow me
[08:15] <pibarnas> <noiesmo> I'll do that!
[08:15] <boink> I did, and it doesn't work
[08:15] <zcat[1] > i still can't get beryl to work reliably. Most of the time when it boots all the window decorations just flicker constantly and nothing works.
[08:15] <noiesmo> pibarnas, you many need to chmod +x nvidia_package_name.bin
[08:15] <boink> and it doesn't work if you install it yourself
[08:15] <boink> dammit
[08:15] <Lovloss> im pretty sure nVidia doesnt mind, they just cant let Ubuntu distribute it unlicensed
[08:15] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain did you get the stuff that I pasted to you? I got what you said but I don't know what to do with the info.
[08:15] <boink> <= angry!
[08:15] <zcat[1] > when it works it's nice though. I probably need a better video card
[08:15] <timephoenix> @Lovloss: I.e. Canonical would have to pay?
[08:15] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: what? where? i dont get it
[08:16] <blazemonger> i'm trying to make a Ubuntu based distro (live version) that has gnomesword on it..
[08:16] <blazemonger> for my mom
[08:16] <burepe> I messaged it to you
[08:16] <burepe> hmm
[08:16] <Lovloss> not sure. i think youd have to pay for a license
[08:16] <blazemonger> i got her into ubuntu through the bible study software
[08:16] <Lovloss> they want people to *know* who made the drivers, not have it integrated into soemone else's software. makes sense really
[08:16] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: use pastebin
[08:16] <boink> well, RealPlayer doesn't work on dapper. great
[08:16] <timephoenix> I know that RISC OS developers had all sorts of trouble because nVidia wouldn't tell them anything without payment
[08:16] <boink> thanks for a "stable" release
[08:16] <sc4ttrbrain> boink: it works !
[08:16] <boink> no, it only crashes on me
[08:17] <boink> it works for me on another box, oh yeah.
[08:17] <blazemonger> why are these hardware companies making their stuff proprietary?
[08:17] <boink> just like skype .. some damm bug in it
[08:17] <sc4ttrbrain> boink: it hates YOU lol
[08:17] <boink> and I hate you too
[08:17] <blazemonger> are they in bed with microsoft or something
[08:17] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[08:17] <boink> dammit
[08:17] <timephoenix> well.. nVidia graphics in the Xbox, and the Intel story i'm sure you know
[08:17] <sc4ttrbrain> boink: whats the output?
[08:18] <boink> it just crashes. no output
[08:18] <blazemonger> i have a gamecube
[08:18] <boink> no sound, nothing
[08:18] <Lovloss> People have a right to let it be stated that something was their creation. nVidia drivers *are* free
[08:18] <timephoenix> Nintendo Wii!!
[08:18] <Caplain> i have an lcd and i want to limit video output to a specific area of the screen, is there a way to do that?
[08:18] <boink> if you check the preferences, it only segfaults
[08:18] <sc4ttrbrain> boink: try launch it from terminal ,see the output
[08:18] <blazemonger> the onlty game i play on the gamecube is metroid prime and tony hawk pro skater american wasteland
[08:18] <boink> I did launch it from the terminal
[08:18] <timephoenix> @Lovloss: They're free, but nVidia has to write them.
[08:18] <boink> and it still didn't work.
[08:18] <sc4ttrbrain> segfault?
[08:18] <blazemonger> a friend of mine wants to reverse engineer the gamecube
[08:18] <boink> it's 100 percent b0rked on my system
[08:18] <sc4ttrbrain> hmmm
[08:19] <timephoenix> Linux on a Gamecube? lol
[08:19] <boink> dammit, and I don't want to have to find out what ubuntu fscked up
[08:19] <zcat[1] > i think sometimes the license technology from other companies and can't share it freely. Other times they could open it, but that opens them to a risk of patent lawsuits from competitiors. If nobody knows how it works, patent holders don't know if it violates any of their patents.
[08:19] <blazemonger> amodify the gamecube so it has usb
[08:19] <boink> this is supposed to be a "stable" release. ha!
[08:19] <sc4ttrbrain> boink: maybe u are the unstable one ;)
[08:19] <boink> no, I'm quite stable
[08:19] <Lovloss> Patents are tricky.  I think if you release something freely, the only thing thats an issue is making sure you're credited for what you did
[08:19] <timephoenix> the whole patent situation is a mess
[08:20] <boink> I know bad coding when I see it
[08:20] <sc4ttrbrain> OMG LOL
[08:20] <gilad_g> hello, can someone please help me? i just installed ubuntu 6.10, and my keyboard is frozen at login time -- i can't type in a user name to log in... num/caps lock don't work either. mouse works.
[08:20] <krznpsk> i'm trying to get dual monitors working using an ATI Radeon + Intel Integrated Graphics ... i have been messing around with xorg.conf, but my right monitor (intel onboard) is still black ... can anyone help me?
[08:20] <zcat[1] > Lovloss: I wich it worked that way. Unfortunately you can write completely original software without looking at anything else and still have a good chance of using something someone else has patented
[08:20] <zcat[1] > *wish
[08:20] <nub_> can somebody help me with the nvidia drivers for edgy?
[08:21] <boink> !nvidia
[08:21] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:21] <nub_> it's not working for me, and i'm doing everything like i'm supposed to
[08:21] <timephoenix> help with a gdm issue plz!
[08:21] <sc4ttrbrain> timephoenix: what is it?
[08:21] <Lovloss> I agree, software patents are deadly. They are also degenerate to a working economy. Its like if only one company could control paper, because they made it first. Which is why they'll never last very long
[08:22] <Lovloss> plus, you cant stop people in the end.
[08:22] <timephoenix> i can't get gdm to start automatically at boot, and when i run it, i get a hal error
[08:22] <boink> kewl, mplayer saves the day.
[08:22] <boink> damm kaffeine.
[08:22] <Lovloss> well im off, thanks as usual for the help yall
[08:22] <zcat[1] > oh well, at least patents don't last 90+ years (yet.. )
[08:23] <steve256> patents don't last forever, nothing last forever :)
[08:23] <timephoenix> have used sysv-rc-conf, gdm is enabled at boot time
[08:23] <gilad_g> anoyone?
[08:23] <boink> !ask
[08:23] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:23] <zcat[1] > Mickey Mouse will be in copyright forever; they'll just keep extending it until the death of the sun, 20 years at a time.
[08:23] <timephoenix> problem only occured after installing Mandriva 2006, which took over grub. menu.lst entry is identical to ubuntu original except for no graphical bootup
[08:24] <timephoenix> The guy who invented the smiley face has gotta be gutted lol
[08:24] <sc4ttrbrain> timephoenix: sorry dunno bout HAL error
[08:24] <gilad_g> hello, can someone please help me? i just installed ubuntu 6.10, and my keyboard is frozen at login time -- i can't type in a user name to log in... num/caps lock don't work either. mouse works.
[08:25] <krznpsk> anyone want to help me get dual monitors configured using an ATI Radeon + Intel onboard graphics?
[08:25] <timephoenix> i have a separate /opt partition, but it's empty, so i assume if i reinstall i will lose everything i installed?
[08:26] <sc4ttrbrain> yes i think u ll lose  everything
[08:26] <zcat[1] > timephoenix: move everything you want to keep to opt and don't reformat it when you reinstall
[08:26] <KenSentMe> krznpsk: i don't think you can run dual monitors on two seperate videocards. I run it on one card with two outputs
[08:26] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain sorry that took so long. pastebin.com isn't working here it is http://pastebin.wikistuce.info/?365
[08:26] <kazim59> sc4ttrbrain: gyachi has stopped when i recieved a file... it has stopped on save file dialog
[08:26] <kazim59> sc4ttrbrain: and its downloading... i cant do anything else
[08:27] <zcat[1] > or did I misunderstand the question? :)
[08:27] <timephoenix> @zcat: but isn't everything split up in different directories? there's just a few programs i want to keep, /home is separate also.
[08:27] <krznpsk> bummer :( it worked in windows
[08:27] <sc4ttrbrain> kazim59: i never try it,but some ppl said sending file just works...?
[08:27] <zcat[1] > timephoenix: Yeah, I see what you mean. You'll lose everything :)
[08:27] <KenSentMe> krznpsk: well, then it might be possible, but i wouldn't know how
[08:28] <timephoenix> haha! i just moved house, and i haven't got broadband connected, so i'm on 56k right now lol
[08:28] <krznpsk> thanks anyway ksm
[08:28] <timephoenix> i might be downloading for the next week hehe
[08:28] <KenSentMe> krznpsk: maybe you could check here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=221174
[08:29] <timephoenix> there's no way to use the alternate install from the Dapper live cd, is there?
[08:29] <KenSentMe> krznpsk: it's a forum topic about running dual screen with ubuntu. The guy who set up the howto answers regularly on most user questions about dual screen. Maybe he knows how to do it.
[08:29] <krznpsk> ksm: i tried a bunch of stuff out of that article but my right monitor is still black
[08:29] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: wait im checking it
[08:29] <KenSentMe> krznpsk: just ask in that topic and maybe someone has a solution
[08:30] <krznpsk> another thing is, when i installed ubuntu, it defaulted to my primary (onboard) graphics device and i got "no screens found" error and couldn't start x at all ... i had to switch to the ATI card to get it working
[08:30] <krznpsk> ok
[08:32] <timephoenix> thanks for the help all, bye bye
[08:32] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: are u sure u complete paste the /etc/hosts ? seems to me it lost the last line..
[08:35] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain this is the last line ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
[08:35] <ChrisBradley> Our irc server is up now...go ubuntu.... irc.ncdrink.com
[08:35] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: ok
[08:36] <ChrisBradley> Good morning everyone
[08:36] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: ok ,mine is like this 192.168.0.5 myusername
[08:36] <burepe> hmm
[08:39] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain You mean that is your last line?
[08:40] <sc4ttrbrain> np
[08:40] <boink> 192.168.* is a fake ip-number as well
[08:40] <boink> it's not a real ip-number, it's only for internal usage
[08:41] <Pie-rate> How do I get divx encoded avi files with ac3 audio to work? the video plays, the audio doesn't. I followed the directions from ubotu on getting non-free formats working, and it doesn't work
[08:41] <Shadowpillar_> ..........
[08:41] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain so you mean I should set my static ip address to that number? Where do I put the username?
[08:41] <Shadowpillar_> it's a real IP
[08:41] <Shadowpillar_> it's just your internal network ip
[08:41] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: your /etc/network/interfaces should be changed like this http://pastebin.wikistuce.info/?366
[08:41] <Shadowpillar_> for your LAN
[08:42] <boink> 192.168* is a RFC 1918 op-number
[08:42] <Dagfari> Could I have some quick help, please?
[08:42] <Shadowpillar_> not your LAN IP
[08:42] <boink> ip-number, I mean. damm keyboard
[08:42] <Shadowpillar_> boink: how in depth is your networking knowledge? :P
[08:42] <nub_> ok can somebody help me with a wine issue?
[08:42] <boink> what's the point of a static rfc 1918 ip?
[08:42] <Shadowpillar_> it's a real IP, it just sint a WAN IP
[08:42] <Shadowpillar_> isnt*
[08:43] <boink> yes, as I said .. RFC1918.
[08:43] <nub_> i'm getting an error about /dev/snd/seq failed
[08:43] <Shadowpillar_> they're necessary for NAT routing
[08:43] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: no problem i mean , according the howto then change that /etc/network/interfaces
[08:43] <Pie-rate> boink, you'd use a static one if you wanted to host something available only in the internal network
[08:43] <Shadowpillar_> which helps allieviate the pool of ipv4 addresses from being completely used up on the internet
[08:44] <boink> yes, and I do that on my office network.
[08:44] <Barry_> I've just put Edgy on an old Thinkpad 390E, and there's so much good stuff in Edgy, I'm looking for even more.
[08:44] <boink> but I could use samba on a dynamic ip number too
[08:44] <burepe> sc4ttrbrain then restart network? I will see you if this works.
[08:44] <Pie-rate> How do I get divx encoded avi files with ac3 audio to work? the video plays, the audio doesn't. I followed the directions from ubotu on getting non-free formats working, and it doesn't work
[08:44] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: wait, checking it
[08:44] <Shadowpillar_> calling it a fake IP is like calling swap "fake memory"
[08:44] <boink> read RFC1918
[08:45] <Barry_> My ThinkPad 390E has the "trackpoint" mouse pointer, and three buttons. With Windows, the third button (blue) acts as a scroller. When you hold the third button and move the trackpoint nubby, it scrolls through your document. Is there a way to make it work that way in Ubuntu?
[08:45] <Pie-rate> shadowpillar_, he already acknowledged that his statement was incorrect by a minor technicality
[08:46] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: then change /etc/hosts into http://pastebin.wikistuce.info/?367
[08:46] <boink> it seems they get a dynamic ip from their isp which is a RFC1918 ip-number
[08:46] <nub_> is there any way to flag a file as not in use any more?
[08:46] <nub_> i'm trying to run a program in wine, and it's telling me its config file is in use. it crashed the first time i rane it
[08:46] <nub_> ran*
[08:46] <sc4ttrbrain> burepe: then just use howto again ;) good luck
[08:46] <Dagfari> nub_ : look through your processes
[08:47] <boink> burepe: what's the point in changing your ip number if it's only a RFC1918 ip?
[08:47] <boink> dynamic/static, what difference does it make then?
[08:47] <nub_> i killed the .exe that wine was hosting. is there a wine executable in there too?
[08:47] <Dagfari> hm
[08:47] <Dagfari> check for it.
[08:47] <burepe> boink: I don't know. I want to set up a server. The faq says I need a static ip.
[08:47] <Dagfari> Wine might be keeping the file open
[08:47] <boink> but you're wasting your time
[08:48] <Dagfari> burepe: www.dyndns.org
[08:48] <somerville32> Dagfari, killall wine
[08:48] <Dagfari> ok yeah
[08:48] <nub_> i found it, there was a wineserver
[08:48] <Dagfari> ok good
[08:49] <Dagfari> nub_ see what somverville32 said
[08:49] <nub_> that doesn't kill a process for me, it was killall wineserver
[08:50] <Dagfari> ok
[08:50] <nub_> strange. i've got my nvidia closed drivers installed, getting 15,000 fps in glxgears so i'm guessing it's accelerated
[08:50] <nub_> but this program just shows black in the 3d parts
[08:50] <burepe> Dagfari: then what do I put in here? Please enter a name for the ISPConfig database (e.g. db_ispconf ig):www-data
[08:50] <burepe> Please enter the IP address of the ISPConfig web (e.g. 192.168. 0.1):
[08:50] <burepe> 
[08:51] <boink> but that IP-number is not visable from the outside world, burepe
[08:51] <Dagfari> burepe what page are you at
[08:51] <Dagfari> the free service just has you specify a public IP address that you can update whenever it changes
[08:51] <boink> burepe: you're wasting your time here.
[08:51] <Dagfari> you can find that at www.whatismyip.com
[08:51] <Dagfari> :echo: boink
[08:52] <boink> and then use www.dyndns.org to set up dynamic ip service
[08:52] <Dagfari> yes.
[08:52] <boink> dyndns.org is really good and free
[08:52] <morghanphoenix> anyone know what package I need to extract archives in konqueror by right clicking?
[08:52] <labanux> do ubuntu upport intel pro 3945 wifi chipset
[08:53] <labanux> i've look'n ubuntu forum.., but still can't install those modules
[08:53] <Dagfari> ok as for my problem
[08:53] <boink> labanux: ndiswrapper
[08:53] <burepe> boink what do i enter here in ispconfigs set up "Please enter the IP address of the ISPConfig web (e.g. 192.168. 0.1):"
[08:53] <boink> what does ifconfig say?
[08:53] <OmgWtfIDiedLol> labanux, yes
[08:54] <OmgWtfIDiedLol> labanux, without ndiswrapper
[08:54] <boink> and ask your isp if you have a dynamic or static ip number

[08:55] <burepe> pastebin is broken
[08:55] <boink> you have a 192.168. number
[08:55] <boink> are you using a router?
[08:55] <burepe> and i cant send messages to people
[08:55] <boink> all I wanted was the ip-number
[08:55] <burepe> then say that
[08:55] <labanux> OmgWtfIDiedLol : without ndiswrapper?? what is this mean??
[08:55] <boink> !ndiswrapper
[08:55] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[08:55] <burepe> yesh
[08:55] <burepe> yes
[08:55] <OmgWtfIDiedLol> labanux, as stated, try googling ipw3945
[08:55] <labanux> i've try'n googling to find that
[08:56] <OmgWtfIDiedLol> labanux, and you don't get proper results>
[08:56] <boink> does your router have a dyndns client built in?
[08:56] <OmgWtfIDiedLol> labanux, just a second i'll get a link
[08:56] <boink> I have a netgear router, and it has a dyndns client in the firmware
[08:56] <OmgWtfIDiedLol> labanux, read this page http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net/
[08:56] <OmgWtfIDiedLol> labanux, that is what you need to get your card working
[08:57] <burepe> I don't know
[08:57] <boink> well, you need to check it
[08:57] <burepe> how
[08:57] <boink> log into the router
[08:57] <burepe> that is not the question I am asking
[08:57] <boink> I don't know which router you have
[08:57] <burepe> I want to know what to enter here
[08:57] <boink> c'mon, I can't hold your hand all the time here
[08:57] <burepe> boink what do i enter here in ispconfigs set up "Please enter the IP address of the ISPConfig web (e.g. 192.168. 0.1):"
[08:57] <boink> that depends on your ip-number
[08:57] <Dagfari> burepe
[08:57] <boink> burepe: are you trolling here?
[08:57] <labanux> OmgWtfIDiedLol : i've read that. I've download ieee82**, ipw 3945, ipw3945d, and firmware package
[08:58] <Dagfari> burepe go to www.whatismyip.com and use THAT NUMBER.
[08:58] <boink> Dagfari: but that won't work if it's a dynamic ip
[08:58] <Dagfari> it will for dyndns
[08:58] <boink> sure, it will work fine
[08:58] <Dagfari> he just has to update it every time his modem resets
[08:58] <boink> but you need to set up a dyndns client
[08:58] <labanux> OmgWtfIDiedLol: doe to it's instruction, i need to install ieee8** first, then continue with ipw3945
[08:58] <Dagfari> yes
[08:58] <boink> and an account with dyndns.org
[08:58] <Dagfari> you don't need a client
[08:58] <Dagfari> just the account
[08:59] <boink> how does your computer give the info to dyndns.org?
[08:59] <Dagfari> you can update it on the dyndns website
[08:59] <labanux> OmgWtfIDiedLol: ieee* succes installed, but ipw3945 can't be installed
[08:59] <Dagfari> manually
[08:59] <burepe> I am looking to figure something out and people keep on chiming in misunderstanding the problem and when I try to follow up the send me on a wild goose chase and make me more confused. Then I am told I am wasing my time. Or go away. I help people on their level when they need it. you should do the same
[08:59] <boink> heh .. that's lame, Dagfari
[08:59] <burepe> dagfari thank you
=== cO_punk is now known as nonik_cute
[08:59] <Dagfari> boink: I know
[08:59] <boink> how? perl script?
[08:59] <boink> burepe: stop being so demanding.
[08:59] <boink> I've tried to help you and you're not listening
[08:59] <Dagfari> hahaha
[09:00] <Dagfari> hahaha
[09:00] <burepe> stop telling me I am wasting my time
[09:00] <boink> good, stop wasting your time then
[09:00] <burepe> I am listening you don't explain well
[09:00] <boink> you don't listen well
[09:00] <Pie-rate> When I try to test my sound, it says "audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Resource busy or not available."
[09:00] <Dagfari> *facepalm*
=== _rpc is now known as rpc
[09:01] <Dagfari> hey boink
[09:01] <Dagfari> any ideas on the issue I'm having with permissions?
[09:01] <boink> no idea, what's the problem?
[09:02] <boink> I'm just so pissed off that realplay doesn't work anymore. grrrrrrr
[09:02] <Dagfari> does realplayer -ever- work?
[09:02] <boink> heh .. that's a good point
[09:02] <Vuen> woah
[09:02] <Vuen> x just spontaneously restarted on me
[09:02] <crimsun> realplay does work, but the plugin needs to be recompiled against firefox 2 with gcc-4.1
[09:03] <Dagfari> basically, I mount my portable (ntfs) hard drive (manually for now pfft set up automatic later), and it gives me "permission denied" to cd to and dir in with every user except root
[09:03] <Vuen> i was listening to music... suddenly the screen died... showed a bunch of services restarting (ssh, samba, etc)
[09:03] <labanux> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs <-- i didn't find about 3945 chipset here..
[09:03] <Vuen> then x restarted
[09:03] <Vuen> where should i look for log files on what happened?
[09:03] <crimsun> in edgy, the plugin will cause ff 2 to segfault
[09:03] <mnepton> Dagfari: change perms on the mount point
[09:03] <Dagfari> tried that
[09:03] <Dagfari> didn't work
[09:03] <Dagfari> chmodded it to 777, didn't work, 700 didn't either
[09:04] <boink> Dagfari: using 2.6 kernel? devfs or something like that
[09:04] <boink> from 2.6, the devices became virtual devices.
[09:04] <Vuen> Dec  5 03:01:12 nick kdm[4124] : X server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly
[09:04] <boink> you do the permissions from devfs, or something like that
[09:04] <Dagfari> how do I checking versions
[09:04] <Vuen> argh
[09:04] <mnepton> sudo chown -R myaccount:myaccount /mount/point
[09:05] <Dagfari> k *tries that*
[09:05] <boink> grrr .. devfs is BSD.
[09:05] <Dagfari> I assume the myaccount:myaccount is username:password
[09:05] <boink> aargh, the same thing but in Linux
[09:05] <mnepton> Dagfari: username:username
[09:05] <shreeve> any useful howto's on xen + edgy + networking in DomU's?
[09:06] <Dagfari> okay.  This'll take a while.
[09:06] <Dagfari> *waits for it to finish*
[09:06] <boink> shreeve: I've read one
[09:06] <Dagfari> I should have mentioned it's a 300 Gb hdd
[09:06] <boink> but it may have been based on dapper
[09:06] <Dagfari> that's almost entirely full
[09:06] <Dagfari> :p
[09:06] <boink> google: ubuntu xen how-to
[09:07] <Dagfari> looks like it's working at it though.  it's about 3/4 of the way done
[09:07] <shreeve> boink - I've done that... but find lotsa dead-ends. in the end, seems like it's just "not possible" right now?!
[09:07] <steve256> is there a player that supports winamp 5 skins?
[09:07] <steve256> modern skins
[09:07] <lumar> guys, im new to linux but ive tried the guides and google and cant find answers. el problemo: i have installed nvidia-glx and enabled it. but when in synaptic i try to install nvidia-settings, it puts nvidia-glx in 'to be removed'
[09:07] <boink> http://www.howtoforge.com/xen_3.0_ubuntu_dapper_drake <= tried that one?
[09:08] <shreeve> boink - yeah, but it's for drake. edgy and xen 3.0.3 changed a few important things
[09:08] <lumar> how could i install settings and keep my drivers?
[09:08] <boink> steve256: maybe xmms ...
[09:08] <CharonX> Question, how do I add another OS to grub in ubuntu ? I cannot find the config file. I have a HD with windows already installed, and want to update the MBR. But Ubuntu has a /boot layout I am unfamiliar with.
[09:09] <boink> OpenSuSE has very good xen support in the yast2, shreeve
[09:09] <Dagfari> mnepton: didn't work.  I bet it sucks that it's ntfs right now, eh?
[09:10] <shreeve> boink - okay, cool. lemme check that out. thanks.
[09:10] <boink> I saw a presentation of SuSE/Xen, it was really nice
[09:11] <mnepton> Dagfari: can you read from NTFS?
[09:12] <Dagfari> yes, my /hdb1 is ntfs.
[09:12] <mnepton> Dagfari: NTFS write is ... not good. don't even try. but now you should be able to read everything on that drive/partition
[09:13] <Dagfari> I'm not trying for ntfs writing
[09:13] <mnepton> Dagfari: best solution is a huge partition that Ubuntu uses as /home and Windows uses as /Documents\ and\ Settings that is formatted ext3
[09:14] <Dagfari> so.
[09:14] <Dagfari> back this portable hard drive up to an alternate computer, format, etc
[09:14] <Dagfari> reformat to ext3
[09:14] <mnepton> wait, if you're not trying to write to NTFS, and you say you can read, what's the issue now?
[09:14] <Dagfari> oh
[09:14] <boink> or ReiserFS if you want to try that
[09:14] <Dagfari> I can read on what would be D: to my winxp computer
[09:15] <mnepton> boink: does Windows have Reiser drivers?
[09:15] <Dagfari> but not on the portable hard drive connected via usb
[09:15] <mnepton> Dagfari: format of the USB drive?
[09:15] <mnepton> Dagfari: mount point of the USB drive?
[09:15] <Dagfari> 300gb of backup is what I'm trying to avoid.
[09:15] <Dagfari> though I suppose I could pare that down
[09:15] <Dagfari> what say you
[09:16] <mnepton> Dagfari: what filesystem does the USB drive use, and what is its mount point in Linux?
[09:16] <Dagfari> ntfs, /media/sda1
[09:16] <Dagfari> from /dev/sda1
[09:16] <Deaigo> england suck
[09:16] <Deaigo> AU FTW
[09:17] <lumar> boo aust
[09:17] <lumar> australia always win = bland cricket
[09:17] <mnepton> Dagfari: sudo chown -R username:username /media/sda1
[09:17] <Deaigo> dude did you watch today
[09:17] <Dagfari> sorry I didn't notice your previous messages
[09:17] <lumar> yeah it was really good haha
[09:17] <Deaigo> we got england out for less than 100
[09:17] <Dagfari> I think I already did that
[09:18] <Deaigo> well...
[09:18] <Dagfari> yes I did
[09:18] <mnepton> Dagfari: then you should be able to read from the USB drive
[09:18] <lumar> i gtg
[09:18] <Dagfari> still can't though
[09:18] <Dagfari> this is what has me annoyed.
[09:18] <jerb_> cool, flash works after this latest update
[09:18] <mnepton> Dagfari: sudo chmod -R +r /media/sda1/*
[09:18] <atarinox> so my sound card suddenly isn't working....is there a reason it would suddenly stop working that isn't a hardware failure
[09:19] <Dagfari> jerb_ : I KNOW!
[09:19] <crimsun> atarinox: probably a mixer config issue
[09:19] <crimsun> atarinox: pastebin ``amixer'' output
[09:19] <Dagfari> ok doing
[09:19] <Dagfari> mnepton: this'll take a minute or two
[09:19] <ademan> is there any way to tell if a repository is down?  I tried going to the URL, but i just got a blank page (i didn't really expect to see anything though) so it seems the server is up, but the repository...
[09:20] <DARKGuy> ademan: what's the url?
[09:20] <atarinox> crimsun: pastebin is a bash command?
[09:20] <rob> any reason for the edgy live cd installer to be running soooo slow on my laptop? (it was running windows xp fine)
[09:21] <ademan> DARKGuy: well here's the deb line deb http://ubuntu.compiz.net/ edgy main-edgy  it was working a while ago
[09:21] <Dagfari> mnepton: [You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "sda1".] 
[09:22] <ademan> DARKGuy: well by a while ago i mean in the order of a month maybe, i hadn't checked lately
[09:22] <pucko-> do anyone know if there are any "unofficial" netinst images or install disks? I want to get ubuntu onto my laptop which doesn't have a cd-drive.
[09:22] <ryukun> ademan, "ping http://ubuntu.compiz.net/"
[09:22] <ademan> ryukun: as i said the server seems to be up, but i don't know about the repository itself
[09:23] <ademan> gee...
[09:23] <rob> pucko-: good luck, on my laptop the installer is painfully slow
[09:23] <rob> and I have a cdrom

[09:37] <DARKGuy> Cyber_Stalker: XMMS is exactly like WinAmp, there's not much difference
[09:37] <Cyber_Stalker> i was gonna recomend winamp, but then rememberd the M$ linux diffrence :P
[09:37] <Cyber_Stalker> if u have wine tho..?
[09:38] <DARKGuy> WinAmp works in WINE too, but it's slower :P

[09:38] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[09:38] <Dagfari> xmms
[09:38] <steve256> vlc also support winamp skins
[09:38] <Dagfari> xmms handles a lot like winamp
[09:38] <steve256> so you can make vlc look like winamp
[09:39] <Dagfari> O:
[09:39] <anurag_> ah, we need a winamp clone :P
[09:39] <steve256> you would like to try bmpx, audacious,e tc
[09:39] <FirstStrike> anurag_: xmms.
[09:39] <Cyber_Stalker> lol @ this
[09:40] <Cyber_Stalker> wtf is this?
[09:40] <FirstStrike> xmms is essentially a winamp clone
[09:40] <anurag_> Firetech, understood ;)
[09:40] <steve256> xmms2 is nice
[09:41] <DARKGuy> steve256: it's on the repos? what's the difference anyways oO
[09:42] <steve256> xmms2 is a new player designed from scratch
[09:42] <DARKGuy> oh, rewrit
[09:42] <DARKGuy> *rewrite, nice
[09:42] <steve256> yeh
[09:42] <DARKGuy> does it conflicts with xmms or do I have to uninstall it?
[09:42] <anurag_> Does anyone have an idea about proxy and all
[09:43] <anurag_> recently, i had been attacked by IRC worm.
[09:43] <steve256> bmpx is also designed from scratch, beep media player was a fork of xmms1 that used gtk2, but they rewrited and now is bmpx

[09:44] <DARKGuy> FirstStrike: Ah, thanks for that =) - shouldn't it be edgy oO?
[09:44] <FirstStrike> Uh, no?
[09:44] <x-r00t-x> FirstStrike, can you give me download link for edgy gnome
[09:44] <FirstStrike> They only have releases for breezy and dapper in the repos right now
[09:44] <FirstStrike> Nothing for edgy yet
[09:44] <Dagfari> oh mnepton
[09:44] <Dagfari> mnept
[09:44] <steve256> xmms2 uses sqlib for storing music info, uses a client <-> server model, and is fast, supports many formats, codecs, etc, and you choose the client that you want

[09:46] <keeganX> Can I install the dapper package in edgy?

[10:04] <Yul> i still can't install any from add/remove app.

[10:07] <anurag_> haha, Yul must be fustrated by now :P
[10:08] <silent_scream> morning
[10:09] <Yul> anurag_ i think so.  maybe because of broken package
[10:09] <maynoth> when I run sudo fsck  it says running while hard drives are mounted could cause serious damage
[10:09] <anurag_> Yul, try this "apt-get -f install"
[10:09] <maynoth> is it possible to run a fsck at startup?
[10:09] <anurag_> and apt-get install vlc
[10:10] <Yul> but is reinstall only one answe  for me?
[10:10] <Yul> ok i'll try it now
[10:10] <Yul> thank you all
[10:10] <x-r00t-x> sudo apt-get install vlc

[10:10] <x-r00t-x> np:P
[10:11] <maynoth> does anyone here know alot about the fsck command?
[10:11] <shooshu> it says /bin/sh: sudo: not found
[10:11] <jared_> I ran dist upgrate, and when it was finished it said it couldn't get all the packages.
[10:12] <silent_scream> my prob is: i try to log into gnome, I give username and pass, and doesn't boot! It just shows me a brown screen and the mouse! no panels no nothing, I can't even use the terminal, the only thing that works is ctrl+alt_backspace! so i exitedand and logged in the gnome terminal mode, and gave the command "top" it showed me that "esd" uses 100% of cpu!!! is this what it faults? what should i do???
[10:13] <RMorris84> is there a way to make the kiba dock pull up my session of gaim instead of opening a new gaim everytime i click it
[10:14] <maynoth> does anyone here have a link to that automatic script which mounts hard drives?

[10:18] <silent_scream> i think i starts esd it self, the question is how can i make the command "killall esd" when i log in..
[10:18] <DARKGuy> xD
[10:18] <shooshu> dont tell me that... its the whole reason why i changed to ubuntu
[10:18] <DARKGuy> shooshu: Lol, it works nicely nicely, pixel shaders and all that :D
[10:18] <shooshu> so i wouldnt play games while im at uni, and now i am losing al my uni work and i dont know why. *cry*
[10:18] <shooshu> shhhh

[10:20] <ryukun> silent_scream, you're welcome, i hope it helps

[10:25] <bray> DARKGuy: I give up on WoW... for now anyway...
[10:25] <DARKGuy> bray: I had to, it crashes with 9626 nvidia drivers in this comp :(
[10:26] <DARKGuy> bray: but I swear it did work, very nicely too
[10:26] <bray> DARKGuy: Well that's a damn shame
[10:26] <DARKGuy> bray: yuh ):
[10:26] <bray> DARKGuy: Not sure if these crappy integrated Intel graphics will work
[10:26] <bray> DARKGuy: Integrated ftl
[10:26] <shooshu> lol bray my problem isnt WoW.. i cant even turn the damn computer on. i just pondered on it, i did some updates yesterday.. i think they have fu#ked up my computer
[10:26] <DARKGuy> bray: Well, in Windows it worked with my internal one...
[10:27] <DARKGuy> shooshu: that's normal :D
[10:27] <Gumby> shooshu: now you get to troubleshoot and fix it... HOORAY for learning!!
[10:27] <Ash-Fox> If you're having WoW problems with Wine. One) Talk to #winehq about it. Two) Wine's application database for the win. Three) Or you could just use the crossover office beta.

[10:27] <bray> shooshu: First, I almost called you Shoobno. Second... what is the computer doing?
[10:28] <DARKGuy> Ash-Fox: No way that co-beta can run WoW oO!
[10:28] <Ash-Fox> DARKGuy, it can't? They spent some time getting just WoW working recently...
[10:29] <shooshu> has any one else had any problems after they updated? like "/bin/sh; can't access tty; job control turned off - and it wont let them get past the damn annoying black screen
[10:29] <bray> DARKGuy: WoW also worked well in Windows with my integrated graphics, but then Windows died, which is why I am now using Xubuntu
[10:29] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, not had that problem yet with today's updates of libgsf and xine.
[10:29] <shooshu> ok
[10:29] <bray> DARKGuy: Though it was rather slow... on account of my laptop running 80 processes including WoW all at once
[10:30] <DARKGuy> Ash-Fox: Then I guess I could try that. So far all Furc versions and Diablo II work
[10:30] <shooshu> so... what is "job control turned off mean???
[10:30] <shooshu> its all a blurb to me
[10:30] <DARKGuy> bray:niiiice >.>;
[10:30] <shooshu> im blonde. and im a female. i got made to use linux, and i am going to kill some one cause all i have ever had is problems. i wanntt windowwwsss back. lol
[10:30] <Ash-Fox> DARKGuy, I believe WoW works fine on vanilla wine using nvidia cards without patching. But you should really check the application database on that.
[10:30] <shooshu> (now im going to get k-lined cause of that)
[10:31] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, well, you can goto the store and buy a copy of windows with a windows license.
[10:31] <bray> DARKGuy: Not really... it made it really fecking slow... I don't even know why I had that many running! I blame it on McAfee
[10:31] <DARKGuy> Ash-Fox: Actually, it does and it did. Maybe in the latest updates they changed something and now it can't get past the loading screen =(
[10:31] <DARKGuy> bray: yay for Linux, no need for antivirus ^^
[10:31] <shooshu> trust me, i had windows
[10:31] <KenSentMe> I have a slot in my laptop for memory sticks. When i insert a card, nothing happens. How can i see if the slot works on ubuntu and my card can be written?
[10:31] <shooshu> my ex who was a c#nt decided to put linux on my computer while i am at uni
[10:31] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, I forget the price but windows home retail is like 95USD
[10:32] <bray> shooshu: Or you could wait until I get two copies of Vista Ultimate for free then buy one off me for the low low price of $200
[10:32] <shooshu> and then decided to break up with me and i dont know how to do anything
[10:32] <DARKGuy> bray: low price of $200, lol
[10:32] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, that's great and all. But if you don't have a windows cd, you're not going to be able to install windows.
[10:32] <Lovloss> Anyone know how to add an image (png, jpeg, bmp) in kino? :P
[10:32] <bray> DARKGuy: It's a helluva lot cheaper than $700, don't you think?
[10:32] <DARKGuy> bray: @_@... yeah
[10:32] <Spee_Der> Good morning everyone.....
[10:32] <Ash-Fox> Unless your system has some sort of secret recovery partition.
[10:33] <DARKGuy> Hey Spee_Der :)
[10:33] <Ash-Fox> DARKGuy, check the appdb?
[10:33] <shooshu> i do have a windows cd
[10:33] <bray> Spee_Der: Guten morgen! Es ist 1:33 AM at mein haus!
[10:33] <DARKGuy> Ash-Fox: I did recently o.o;
[10:33] <shooshu> i just wantttt to start up my computer so i can get to my uni assignments that is due tomorrow
[10:33] <Ash-Fox> DARKGuy, meh :/
[10:34] <bray> shooshu: What does the computer do when you try to turn it on?
[10:34] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, yet you're on IRC right now...
[10:34] <Spee_Der> Yeh bray, it's 4:33 'ere and I'm on 1st cup o' mud.....
[10:34] <Spee_Der> Hey DARK, how's things ?
[10:34] <shooshu> im on my mums computer
[10:34] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, well, what's the problem with ubuntu currently?
[10:34] <shooshu> my computer is right beside me when i turn my computer on, it starts up normally  bringing up the ubuntu loading essential drivers..  etc.. and then it continues to load and then it brings  up a new screen that is black and has white writing saying    "BusyBox v1.01 (Debian 1:1.01-4ubuntu3) Built-in shell (ash)   Enter 'Help' for a list of built-in commants /bin/sh: can't access tty; Job control turned off.

[10:37] <vlt> Hello, does anyone know how to place *one* page of a ps document multiple times on a size a4 page? I tried using using `psnup` but it seems that it expects a multipage doc as input.
[10:37] <shooshu> and it wont let me type anything
[10:37] <silent_scream> ryukun,  the advice with the init.d didn't worked... the thing is, i managed to log into gnome , by ctrl+alt+F2 then "killall esd" then ctrl+alt+F7. so how can i make esd not to start with gnome?
[10:38] <bray> shooshu: I say you reinstall Linux
[10:38] <shooshu> ... i say lets not
[10:38] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, type the command 'startx'
[10:38] <Spee_Der> shooshu, can you start it using the cd instead of what is on the hd ?
[10:38] <shooshu> because if i do... i will have to redo my uni assignment that is due tomorrow
[10:38] <shooshu> i dont have the cd. my cunt of a ex has it
[10:38] <shooshu> i didnt get a copy
[10:38] <shooshu> soz about the swaring. im just annoyed and frustrated
[10:39] <DARKGuy> Actually, I'm gonna try that howto...
[10:39] <Spee_Der> download an iso and burn another one, then go into the hd and change what needs changing....
[10:39] <Ash-Fox> Well, you don't have a typical default ubuntu setup either. Usually the defaults are to send you into a graphical enviroment. not.. busybox
[10:39] <DARKGuy> so I guess I'm off for the night/day 'til later
[10:39] <bray> See ya DARK
[10:39] <shooshu> and i did type in the command startx and it comes up with "/bin/sh:startx: not found
[10:39] <DARKGuy> Ash-Fox: looks more like an alternate ubuntu install? =/
[10:39] <Spee_Der> Ciao DARK....
[10:39] <DARKGuy> See you all ^_^ :D
[10:40] <Spee_Der> shooshu.....   in terminal, cd /etc/X11 then have a look at the xorg.conf file.....
[10:40] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, okay.. type in 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' this should download the default ubuntu desktop  and so on.
[10:40] <bray> I should probably get heading too... it's 1:40 and I am supposed to get up at 5:30
[10:41] <shooshu> ok hang on
[10:41] <Spee_Der> Ciao bray.....
[10:41] <Ash-Fox> Then when you restart after that command, you should get a fully graphical interface.
[10:41] <shooshu> but it has a # infront of it
[10:41] <shooshu> how do i get rid of that
[10:41] <bray> Gute nacht allst
[10:41] <bray> Spee_Der: see ya
[10:41] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, # is fine. It just means you're logged in as root.

[10:44] <shooshu> it says cd: 4: can't do cd to /ls
[10:44] <Ash-Fox> That should give a listing of all the folders in root. Hopefully your home folder is still intact.
[10:44] <Ash-Fox> I said 'cd /' and then 'ls'
[10:45] <Ash-Fox> Two different commands.

[10:47] <Ash-Fox> err shooshu.. this isn't looking good.
[10:47] <shooshu> ...
[10:48] <shooshu> now is not a good time to joke around
[10:48] <Ash-Fox> what happens when you type mount /home ?
[10:49] <shooshu> ... cannot read /etc/fdtab: no such file or directory
[10:49] <Ash-Fox> Okay, so your /etc/fstab is missing...
[10:50] <shooshu> .. ok

[10:52] <alex_t> hello
[10:52] <alex_t> i have a little problema with a package
[10:52] <shooshu> i feel like a idiot. im sorry. i did thatand /bin/sh: bash: not found..
[10:52] <alex_t> someone can help me ?
[10:53] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, well, to be honest. What happened to your system baffles me, it's like someone puposely got into it, configured it that way and removed all the useful utilities.
[10:53] <Spee_Der> alex what package ?
[10:53] <shooshu> but no one has turned on my computer since i was home yesterday
[10:53] <shooshu> and it was working fine.
[10:54] <shooshu> the only thing that i did was chat, checked email, listened to music and then did updates
[10:54] <shooshu> so i am blaming the people that made me update.
[10:55] <Ash-Fox> can you type 'less /var/log/syslog', you will find a lot of information there (you can use the cursor keys to scroll up and down). I'd like you to try to find anything that mentions 'mount', you can use the search function in less by typing '/mount'
[10:56] <whyme> hi all
[10:56] <dcordes> how can i restore the GRUB mbr in edgy?
[10:56] <Laosboyme> :-*
[10:56] <Ash-Fox> Thing is.. the only updates that were done recently were just xine and gslib.. xine is just a media player and gslib is just a simple library that isn't tied into the system..
[10:56] <whyme> can anyone help me with a little network-manager problem please?
[10:56] <shooshu> it says that it cant be found
[10:56] <dcordes> (i'm in the actual system right now because i booted with a SGD)
[10:56] <whyme> dcordes: do you have an edgy install disk
[10:56] <whyme> ?
[10:56] <dcordes> nah
[10:56] <dcordes> only live
[10:56] <dcordes> i
[10:56] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, gah.. You have no logs. Would you happen to have the ubuntu cd on you?
[10:57] <dcordes> i'm in the system...
[10:57] <shooshu> no i dont :(
[10:57] <shooshu> my ex has it
[10:57] <whyme> does the live one not have a text-mode installer when you boot?
[10:57] <dcordes> i don't think so
[10:57] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, I take it he installed ubuntu and so on?
[10:57] <whyme> dcordes: I think the command is something like grub-install...
[10:57] <dcordes> isn't there a way to do it from ubuntu?
[10:57] <shooshu> yep
[10:58] <whyme> dcordes:
[10:58] <Shadowpillar> windows XP hates my system
[10:58] <shooshu> i dont know anything about this. he just refused to touch windows.
[10:58] <whyme> dcordes: if you type man grub-install into a command line, it should tell you how to do it.
[10:58] <shooshu> so he popped on linux and then ended up breaking up with me and i am confused as pie
[10:58] <dcordes> whyme: i allready did this and it didn't work
[10:58] <whyme> :S
[10:58] <whyme> what happens when you try to boot?
[10:59] <Ash-Fox> shooshu, you really need to get the ubuntu cd or get your ex to help you. :/
[10:59] <dcordes> it says something like error 15 file not found
[10:59] <dcordes> whyme: :
[10:59] <whyme> right
[10:59] <silent_scream> den doulepse..
[11:00] <whyme> dcordes: when you open a command line, and type "grub-" and then press tab twice, what does it tell you?
[11:00] <silent_scream> ryukun, didn't worked
[11:00] <Ash-Fox> Something happened, but, I don't know what. You don't have the software on the system accessible for some reason to help us figure out what happened. The ubuntu cd does.
[11:00] <dcordes> whyme: a lot
[11:00] <Agiofws> where does ubuntu store its startup scripts ?
[11:01] <whyme> dcordes: it should give you 6 options: grub-floppy       grub-install      grub-md5-crypt    grub-reboot       grub-set-default  grub-terminfo
[11:01] <Agiofws> /etc/rc.d ?
[11:01] <dcordes> no it gives me hundrets
[11:01] <dcordes> of
[11:01] <whyme> dcordes: oh... in that case, what happens when you type "sudo grub-install" and press enter?
[11:02] <dcordes> whyme: why don't you say: figure it out yourself :-)
[11:02] <Agiofws> where does ubuntu store its startup scripts ?
[11:02] <dcordes> i allready did the grub-install command which turns out in an error when i try to boot it
[11:03] <blazemonger> when i'm in gnome and i go to the screensaver options it freezes my machine
[11:03] <shooshu> ok. thanks Ash-Fox
[11:03] <blazemonger> on the molecule screensaver it automaticaly chooses that one
[11:03] <valarians> does anyone in here have experience dealing with ccxstream?
[11:03] <blazemonger> it made it so i couldnt even drop to console mode
[11:05] <whyme> dcordes: when I wanted to restore my grub last time, I used the "alternate install" cd. I think the livecd gives you an option to do a text-mode install as it's booting. I just went through the language steps, used the "go back" button to then just install the grub bootloader. If the livecd doesn't do it for you, and doesn't have a text-mode installer on boot, then get the alternate install cd and install grub that way.
[11:06] <dcordes> whyme: ok thanks for your help
[11:06] <blazemonger> i have a rage 128
[11:06] <blazemonger> my screensaver freezes my computer
[11:06] <blazemonger> to where i have to reboot
[11:06] <mnepton> blazemonger: set the screensaver to blank only
[11:06] <tabman> I need to do voice chat through ubuntu over my msn messenger & google talk, how do I do it ?
[11:06] <blazemonger> how do i do that from console mode
[11:07] <mnepton> blazemonger: you're prolly trying to run a (random) 3d accelerated saver, and the video driver is going orthagonal.
[11:07] <Shadowpillar> what's the virtual card on vmware player supposed to be?
[11:07] <blazemonger> i cant set the screensaver to blank because when i go to the screensaver app it goes automatically to the molecule saver
[11:07] <mnepton> blazemonger: why do it from the console? just boot into GNOME and change the saver settings.
[11:07] <Shadowpillar> ethernet card I mean
[11:07] <blazemonger> i've tried that
[11:08] <blazemonger> when i select screensaver options it just freezes
[11:08] <mnepton> blazemonger: boot to GNOME and run gconf-editor from a terminal
[11:08] <whyme> right, does anyone know why the nm-applet (networkmanager) might all of a suddent (i.e. after tinkering with network-admin) not see my wireless interface?
[11:09] <mnepton> whyme: because NM shuts itself down if it detects anything else has altered /etc/network/interfaces
[11:09] <blazemonger> mnepton: it freezes still
[11:09] <blazemonger> i can't make it select a different screensaver
[11:10] <mnepton> blazemonger: how is it freezing if you're not opening it?
[11:10] <mnepton> 05:08 < mnepton> blazemonger: boot to GNOME and run gconf-editor from a terminal
[11:12] <tabman>  I need to do voice chat through ubuntu over my msn messenger & google talk, how do I do it ?

[11:15] <mnepton> whyme_: you edit /etc/network/interfaces to make it *exactly* like it was the last time NM touched it
[11:15] <Doow> or setting different colors for the panel different for different virtual desktops for that matter
[11:15] <Lovloss> anyone know any chat rooms that can help me with webpage making issues?

[11:19] <blazemonger> figured it out
[11:19] <Engrish> hello
[11:20] <kaptengu> I want system temperatures to be displayed in the top panel in gnome, how do I get that?
[11:21] <Doow> Agiofws: that's the general place for startup scripts, can't see anything about esd though
[11:21] <Agiofws> me too
[11:21] <Doow> Agiofws: but I think that's where it should be =(
[11:22] <Agiofws> ok how do I STOP esd from loading once i log into gnome  from GDM its using 100% mem
[11:22] <Engrish> if an iso write keep failing at the same file is it a bad iso or bad disk?
[11:23] <Doow> Engrish: what error message do you get? hard to know without that =(
[11:23] <momal> Does anyone know how I might beable to get libc6 >= 2.5 | I have edgy, and im after liblua5.1 but it needs libc6 >= 2.5 and I have 2.4 and there isn't any packages I can find for it.
[11:24] <Engrish> "Failed to read sector xxxxx: unrecoverable read error" then "sector xxxxx maps to CASPER\FILESYSTEM.SQUASHFS"
[11:24] <Engrish> did it 3 times with 2 different drive...same file location
[11:24] <Engrish> MD5 checked out ok
[11:25] <KenSentMe> I have a cardreader in my laptop that reads my sd card well. It also can read memory stick cards, but when i insert one, nothing happes. How can i solve that. Is there a kernel module i need to enable?
[11:25] <Agiofws>  It also can read memory stick cards, but when i insert one, nothing happes ?
[11:26] <Agiofws> you mena it canot read other cards ?
[11:26] <Doow> Engrish: did you get a md5 file with the iso, or did your burner program create it prior to burning?
[11:26] <KenSentMe> Agiofws: i mean, it should be able to read ms cards, but nothing happens when i insert one
[11:27] <KenSentMe> Agiofws: so, sd works, ms doesn't, but should
[11:27] <Engrish> i used Hashtab and it generated its own hash number and i check it against the help website
[11:28] <Doow> Engrish: so you created it yourself prior to burning?
[11:28] <Engrish> i guess
[11:28] <Doow> Engrish:  and then when the cd is burnt the image written to the disc fails the check?
[11:29] <Engrish> there was no md5 file to download with on Ubuntu website
[11:29] <Engrish> yeah...4x write speed fails but at 1x write...it's ok but fails at verify
[11:30] <Doow> Engrish: sounds like a broken disc imho, could be broken cd-burner/cd-reader, but broken disc is most likely
[11:30] <Agiofws> KenSentMe,  i think i had that problem  but solved it enabeling a kernel module
[11:30] <RMorris84> how can i add a launcher to bring my current gaim buddylist to the kiba_dock. The current "launcher" that i have launches the program again... I want it to bring up my buddylist if gaim is already open. Is this possible?
[11:30] <KenSentMe> Agiofws: do you remember which one?
[11:30] <Agiofws> its like reading multiple  drives in one...
[11:31] <Agiofws> check out   usb   i think \
[11:31] <KenSentMe> Agiofws: yeah, same here
[11:31] <KenSentMe> Agiofws: what do you mean?
[11:31] <Agiofws> in the usb modules maybe
[11:33] <Agiofws> KenSentMe,   try the module usb-storage
[11:33] <Agiofws> do you have that enabled ?
[11:34] <Engrish> ok stupid question...you should be able to burn an iso to a cd-rw right?
[11:34] <Agiofws> ii think so
[11:35] <gazedo> my sound doesn't go up as loud as it is supposed to, the lspci is "00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)", can i fix it?

[11:35] <KenSentMe> Agiofws: nothing happens, nothing shows up in dmesg
[11:35] <gazedo> Engrish, yes you can burn an iso onto a cdrw
[11:35] <Agiofws> Engrish, to make iso image do :::mkisofs -J -R -U -o trt2.iso Back-stage2004/
[11:36] <Agiofws> Engrish,  to write to cd do    :::cdrecord dev=/dev/hdd -nofix -data -v speed=10 trt2.is
[11:36] <Agiofws> o
[11:36] <Agiofws> ok ;
[11:36] <Engrish> i wonder why it keep failing on the same file
[11:36] <momal> Does anyone know how I might beable to get libc6 >= 2.5 | I have edgy, and im after liblua5.1 but it needs libc6 >= 2.5 and I have 2.4 and there isn't any packages I can find for it.
[11:36] <Engrish> may be i got a lemon cd-rw
[11:36] <gazedo> my sound doesn't go up as loud as it is supposed to, the lspci is "00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)", can i fix it?
[11:38] <Doow> Engrish: try burning some other iso to that same cd-rw
[11:38] <Engrish> ok will do
[11:38] <Doow> Engrish: and you'll know if it's the cd-rw that fails
[11:38] <gazedo> can anybody help me with my sound?
[11:38] <Engrish> what iso fits on a single cd?
[11:38] <MistaED> gazedo: if you find a fix for it, you need to tell me how! :) i've come across a couple of AC'97-based onboard chipsets which have had weak sound output and distortion if you turn it up too much
[11:38] <Daverocks> Engrish: up to 700 MB usually
[11:39] <Alpha_Binary> Hello. My Ubuntu recently screwed up and will no longer boots. Anyone free to help me get it up and running again? (Yes, description will follow.)
[11:39] <Engrish> i meant an specific iso file
[11:40] <RMorris84> what is a good place to get gnome icon sets besides gnome-look
[11:40] <Doow> Engrish: take a look at http://www.distrowatch.com for a lot of different isos =)
[11:40] <gazedo> MistaED, will do, any idea of where to look for a fix
[11:40] <Daverocks> Engrish: um, a netbsd iso? :P they're around 200 MB i think
[11:40] <Engrish> thanks doow
[11:40] <Daverocks> Engrish: most ones will do
[11:40] <Doow> Engrish: dunno any specific offhand
[11:41] <MistaED> gazedo: i've tried the forums without much success and the ALSA man pages, all i can say is that it's not just with ubuntu, suse has the same issue
[11:41] <Alpha_Binary> I was running xubuntu kernel 2.16.15-27. So yesterday I resumed it from s3 sleep as usual, plugged in the wifi card (it's a notebook) and gksudo wifi-radar to locate a hotspot.
[11:42] <Daverocks> s3 sleep, i can already sense a problem coming on here, lol
[11:42] <Alpha_Binary> I picked one, clicked connect, and whole app crashed.
[11:42] <vakuum> How would I make something happen when a user logins via ssh? Like give them permissions to mount their homefolder, so it mounts automatic?
[11:42] <Alpha_Binary> So I tried to relaunch it and it says input/output error.
[11:42] <Alpha_Binary> I was confused, so I ls. File not found. Uh-oh..
[11:43] <Alpha_Binary> cp, mv, rm now no longer worked.
[11:43] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: like, nothing in /bin ? o_O
[11:43] <Alpha_Binary> Exactly.
[11:43] <Alpha_Binary> And perhaps /lib too, since nothing will run.
[11:44] <kalm> i still dont get it... the whole system doesnt boot or just some apps?
[11:44] <Alpha_Binary> At that point I had two terminal windows open, so I tried to launch another, to see if it's possible...
[11:44] <MistaED> gazedo: hmm, try in the sound mixer to enable more controls, there might be a sound booster in there as a tick option similar to the mic boost
[11:44] <Alpha_Binary> That crashed everything, and I had to force reboot.
[11:44] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: well the problem was that you were running an app as root... which is why something like that _could_ happen... but then again, you probably needed to be root for the wifi app
[11:44] <Alpha_Binary> And now, it won't boot any more.
[11:44] <warty> hello from vienna! absolute beginners question/ it must be possible to make a backup of my internal hdd to an external, running the ubuntu live-cd, RIGHT?? tanks!!!
[11:44] <tahorg> is edgy broken ? I
[11:44] <kalm> ...right
[11:45] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: not surprised, /boot/vmlinuz probably got deleted along with everything else
[11:45] <kalm> edgy is unstable...
[11:45] <Alpha_Binary> Daverocks: yep I guessed so.. though I installed that package from aptitude >_>
[11:45] <tahorg> I've made an upgrade yesterday, an now no gnome app is opening
[11:45] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: that's a really really bad bug... a program doing something like rm -rf / when it crashes, lol
[11:45] <warty> ok, because i was not able to get access to my external drive running the live-cd.
[11:45] <Alpha_Binary> I tried echo *, though, and it showed that files in my home folder were intact. Strange.
[11:46] <warty> i guess there is some set up to that will help
[11:46] <Miruna19> those files remained in cahce
[11:46] <Daverocks> note to everyone: _do not do_ "rm -rf /", it'll destroy the system (just in case some of you were curious :S)
[11:46] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: interesting
[11:46] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[11:46] <Alpha_Binary> The error message given upon booting reads: /dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root failed to mount (i/o error)
[11:46] <Miruna19> chmod 777 / that too
[11:47] <Engrish> is there a linux bible for uber retards but does a better job than "Linux for Dummy" book
[11:47] <Alpha_Binary> Now I'm stuck with BusyBox. ):
[11:47] <momal> Does anyone know how I might beable to get libc6 >= 2.5 | I have edgy, and im after liblua5.1 but it needs libc6 >= 2.5 and I have 2.4 and there isn't any packages I can find for it.
[11:48] <Alpha_Binary> I just want to know 1) if it's possible to recover the system and avoid a full re-install, and 2) could bad harddisk be responsible for all this
[11:49] <Shadowpillar> I lol'd at the fact XP hates my computer
[11:49] <Shadowpillar> it freezes on install
[11:49] <kalm> well Shadow dont cheat on it :P
[11:49] <kalm> i dont have a XP on mine anymore
[11:49] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: ok, that's kind of a bad problem, heh... well, your OS is pretty much dead now, you can mount the ubuntu partition under a liveCD or something and recover whatever data you can, then just re-install
[11:49] <craigp84> anyone know how to disable xcreensaver for all users - like not load it at all? it's locking up my nvidia drivers (pc never freezes with nv driver)
[11:50] <Doow> craigp84: maybe you can deinstall it
[11:50] <Daverocks> craigp84: the only reason xscreensaver activates is because it's running in the background
[11:51] <Alpha_Binary> I can sense my holidays diminishing...
[11:51] <craigp84> Doow, yeah but then you need to deinstall ubuntu-desktop :-( i just want to unconfig it
[11:51] <Alpha_Binary> Anyway, thanks a million, Daverocks (:
[11:51] <Doow> craigp84: didn't know ubuntu-desktop depended on it =(
[11:51] <craigp84> Daverocks, where is it launched from?
[11:51] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: if that happened to me, i would be killing myself
[11:51] <Daverocks> Alpha_Binary: kind of not literally :P
[11:51] <Alpha_Binary> Heh
[11:51] <Daverocks> craigp84: uh, might depend on your desktop environment
[11:52] <kalm> Alpha_Binary: look if the Ubuntu LiveCD has an RECOVERY option on it
[11:52] <Daverocks> ok, someone else help these guys in here, i gtg
[11:52] <selinuxium> hi all, Is there anyone here who knows how to administer a NetWare server via ubuntu? There are SuSe rpms out there, but I don't want to have to use it.
[11:52] <Daverocks> cya all
[11:52] <lamaka> craigp84, maybe uncheck "idle session" in property page xscreensaver
[11:52] <craigp84> Daverocks, i've raided through /etc/X11 to no avail, tried /etc/init.d just in the offchance, but nothing sensible
[11:53] <selinuxium> craigp84: you just missed him...
[11:54] <craigp84> lamaka, yeah that was going to be my fall back... but i need to apply for all users, so i'd need to enable root account, log into gnome, do a "gconf-editor" find the relevant key, right click, choose set as mandatory, log out of root, disable account again :-(

[12:06] <craigp84> boo hiss, FTR, turns out that gnome-screensaver is used now. But if i completely turn it off, then the "quit" button wont work, as the wee dialog which have logout / reboot /shutdown buttons uses gnome-screensaver for that functionality. As i say just FTR

[12:18] <Adross> how do I change the time in text only mode?
[12:19] <bimberi> Adross: use the "date" command
[12:19] <mnepton> Adross: you should use NTP
[12:19] <Adross> bimberi: that displays the time and date, i want to change it
[12:19] <Adross> mnepton: i'm listening

[12:21] <Doow> Engrish: it failed with another iso too?
[12:21] <mnepton> Adross: sudo ntpdate ntp.saard.net
[12:21] <Engrish> doow: yes
[12:21] <Doow> Engrish: =(
[12:21] <Adross> mnepton: thankyou
[12:21] <Engrish> exact same problem but different sectors
[12:21] <Adross> no server suitable for synchornisation found
[12:22] <Engrish> ah screw it...i don't really need to install Ubuntu
[12:22] <mnepton> Adross: that should query a time server in Adelaide and set the correct time.
[12:22] <Doow> Engrish: yes you do =)
[12:22] <Engrish> i doubt those people know how to use it anyway...they can barely use XP
[12:22] <Doow> Engrish:  you could try using instlinux if you want to install without adding any other bootable media
[12:22] <Doow> Engrish: haha
[12:23] <Ropechoborra> Hi, I'm trying to share my internet connection (with kubuntu edgy) to a Windows XP Laptop via LAN... I recive pings from the laptop but i cant access from it to my kubuntu pc.. any ideas? It may be a Samba config problem...  Dont have much idea =(
[12:23] <Doow> Engrish: http://sourceforge.net/projects/instlux it only does ubuntu 6.06, but you can always upgrade
[12:23] <bimberi> mnepton: it's probably at the pub celebrating the cricket win :)
[12:24] <jellegan1> instlinux?
[12:24] <mnepton> Adross: sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
[12:24] <Adross> thanks
[12:24] <Doow> jellegan1: it installs linux (suse or ubuntu) from windows without the usage of any external bootable media
[12:25] <Engrish> damn it even full erase won't fix the stupid disk
[12:25] <Doow> jellegan1: it's a pain if you don't have a good network connection though, since it downloads almost everything during the install
[12:26] <jellegan1> well, I figured as much.
[12:26] <mnepton> Engrish: did you md5sum the .iso?
[12:27] <Doow> mnepton: yes, and he tried two different isos
[12:27] <mnepton> did you burn them at </= 4x speed?
[12:28] <Engrish> mnepton: yes i md5 check using Hasttab (as suggested on Ubuntu website) and i burn them at 1x
[12:28] <mnepton> Engrish: and what happens when you try and boot?
[12:28] <Engrish> error reading disk
[12:28] <Engrish> imgburn can write but can't verify
[12:29] <mnepton> you either have a bad image, a bad burn, or wonky burning software

[12:29] <mnepton> try CDBurnerXP?
[12:29] <frflame> hey
[12:30] <Adross> Ropechoborra: tell me about your setup. Are the laptop and pc connected to the same router?
[12:30] <mnepton> Ropechoborra: Samba has nothing to do with connection sharing. did you install and set up iptables?
[12:30] <Engrish> i try burning twice using Imgburn with 2 different drive same result
[12:30] <Engrish> i could try using nero
[12:30] <mnepton> Engrish: try CDBurnerXP. it's free.
[12:30] <Ropechoborra> mnepton yeap... that might be... i'll check to accept from my laptops ip and then i tell you.. =)

[12:31] <Qwerty> how do I make it use 127.0.0.1
[12:32] <frflame> because 'AOL' is silly..

[12:32] <frflame> hm
[12:32] <mnepton> Qwerty: you can't invent domain names in httpd.conf and expect apache to use them
[12:32] <frflame> whats roadrunner
[12:32] <frflame> ?
[12:32] <mnepton> frflame: leave AOL?
[12:33] <Qwerty>  so why isnt it using 127.0.0.1 as before restart ?
[12:33] <jellegan1> better than aol.

[12:33] <frflame> roadrunner is a isp?
[12:33] <mattfury> is there a way i can install ubuntu installation in verbose (text-only) mode?
[12:33] <mnepton> Qwerty: http://localhost
[12:33] <frflame> I live in the UKAY.
[12:33] <jellegan1> yep.
[12:33] <frflame> i dont live in teh YOUESSAY.
[12:34] <Qwerty> the problem is, when I try localhost and try opening a PHP file it asks to download, when I visit 127.0.1.1 and open the php file, it opens

[12:36] <Qwerty> hehe ok I'll try that
[12:36] <Qwerty> thanks mnepton
[12:36] <jellegan1> that's very much like roadrunner here in the US.
[12:36] <frflame>  mnepton AOL is soo anoyying.. oh my god..
[12:36] <frflame> If I had the cash
[12:37] <frflame> I would sue them
[12:37] <mnepton> Qwerty: honestly, i could tell you. but then we'd just have another "web administrator" that has no real idea of how things work. we already have enough of those, and you're too smart to be another one. ;)
[12:37] <Qwerty> hehe am a student :p
[12:37] <Qwerty> just trying my hand at learning PHP
[12:37] <mnepton> "smart" has little to do with "educated"
[12:38] <Qwerty> right :)
[12:38] <jellegan1> frflame - you wouldn't be the first.
[12:38] <frflame> damm I feel so upset.. :(
[12:38] <frflame> but wait?
[12:38] <mnepton> take a look at all the PhD professors that stare at undergraduate girls' boobs. NOT smart. educated, but not smart.
[12:39] <frflame> I found something its called pengaol anyone knows if it will work with ubuntu?

[12:40] <jellegan1> it's supposed to work with Debian....
[12:40] <frflame> so there is no chace with ubuntu//:S
[12:41] <frflame> ?
[12:41] <mnepton> frflame: the path of least resistance is getting a real ISP.

[12:44] <frflame> We do not offer direct support for Linux. However, the speedtouch 330 modem that we supply does have some (at least) Linux support - http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net/
[12:44] <frflame> Once you have either the modem or router connected to the Linux box successfully we will be able to answer any questions regarding ADSL settings.
[12:44] <frflame> Unfortunately due to the limitations that we have to place on the support desk the support of Linux is something which we are unable to provide.

[12:56] <rasputnik> stefg: isn't that built in? There's a box you tick for 'print to file' in the print dialog.
[12:56] <surface> bimberi, haha, this is what i do and it do not resolve..., thanks anyway
[12:57] <frogzoo> Rocito: preferences -> keyboard
[12:57] <rasputnik> wizo: scroll up from the bottom. It dumps the environment at the end - above that is the error.

[12:59] <bimberi> taylor: Ubuntu has Sun java 1.5 available in the multiverse repository
[12:59] <Crazysk8> and the user is already added, but not good i think
[12:59] <bimberi> GreyGhost: it has the classic text based installer
[01:00] <taylor> bimberi: that's update 8 which is *old*, i need update 10
[01:01] <bimberi> taylor: ah
[01:01] <stefg> rasputnik: i just checked... no way. I'd simply want to add a printer, but the wizard insists on configuring the Epson on USB, i don't get the option to choose an alternative. What do I miss here?
[01:02] <bimberi> taylor: you use the java-package package to do it.  The page on the Ubuntu wiki doesn't seem to describe the procedure any more, hopefully you can find a guide
[01:02] <rasputnik> stefg: in thunderbird/firefox/evince I choose file->print. it comes up with the print dialog. under 'properties' next to the printer list is a checkbox, 'print to file'.
[01:03] <GreyGhost> bimberi , i meant ... whther there is an option to get the newer (LiveCD thingy) installer with the alternate too.... cos i dont mind the text based one ... but maybe some of my friends may wwant cds with the livecd ....

[01:05] <rasputnik> wizo: you have to read the compiler errors, I'm afraid.
[01:05] <bimberi> GreyGhost: no, the Desktop CD has the live installer only and the Alternate CD has the text installer only

[01:41] <Navyseal> Randakar need something like visual studio express

[01:44] <YU7XW> I need some small help about using/installing....etc ubuntu (i hope that i made right choice)
[01:44] <rohan> YU7XW: you made the right choice ? :D
[01:44] <Navyseal> it's a pixelview play pro tv ultra chipset Conexant CX23880
[01:44] <stefg> Navyseal: analog or DVB-/T/S/C
[01:44] <YU7XW> TNX
[01:45] <rohan> YU7XW: well, let me tell you, you made the best available choice, imo
[01:45] <Randakar> Navyseal: Maybe you can try KDevelop or Eclipse, but frankly I don't know if they do VB
[01:45] <YU7XW> what the questions are> I am developing some hardware with PIC micros...thats not so much important, but  my friend need to write a C++ program on PC
[01:45] <Navyseal> stefg how do i know that?
[01:45] <YU7XW> in electronics, we call that SCADA software
[01:45] <Navyseal> Randakar ok thks
[01:45] <Randakar> Anyone know where the dev's hang out? I need a bug fixed ;-)
[01:46] <YU7XW> first, we started in Borland C++ under window$. It worked nice. I have the same controls, but for Linux. My friend told me that ubuntu is OK package for me, because i need later to install that PC into factory
[01:46] <YU7XW> where people dont know anything about computers.... thats why i need stable system :)
[01:47] <stefg> Navyseal: Let me put it different: Define 'TV' for your country.. Do you get numbers or voltage out of your TV-socket :-) ?
[01:47] <YU7XW> Ive jsut installed ubuntu and - what next? what c++ IDE, where to take a l0ok etc....
[01:47] <Navyseal> stefg it's works with cable and antenna, not with satellite
[01:47] <timo90> im a bit busy please wait 4 me
[01:47] <Randakar> YU7XW: for C++ KDevelop will probably be the closest to what you want
[01:47] <pty> YU7XW: also anjuta?
[01:48] <YU7XW> Ive just put to download anjuta
[01:48] <rohan> yes, anjuta is great too
[01:48] <stefg> Navyseal: so lets assume you got analog TV...
[01:48] <Navyseal> ok
[01:49] <stefg> Does lspci show your card? Does dmesg report a frontend for your card to be set up?
[01:49] <Navyseal> lspci shows
[01:49] <YU7XW> Now, please, is ubuntu OK for such application? The idea is that i have a few pumps, placed in the city, controlled by small hardware. That hardware is connected vit radio-data modem to base unit and base unit is with serial port to PC

[02:02] <stefg> Navyseal: the card is already halfinstalled, it's just that due to a design flaw the card isn't auto-configurable in Linux, so you need to tell the driver, which card it is. Then you get a device in /dev/dvb/adapter0 and can use kaffeine, vlc or gxine to watch TV... kaffeine is prolly easiest, because it can scan the channels automatically
[02:02] <Engrish> argh...bloody hell..it's bad media
[02:04] <solevita> hi   i've got a question..    does anybody know where i can find graphiccarddrivers?
[02:04] <Navyseal> stefg doesn't exists any tutorial? :S
[02:05] <IdleOne> solevita,  need more details. what card? make and model
[02:06] <Engrish> doow: thanks for your help but it seem to be a bad media
[02:06] <Doow> Engrish: ok =(
[02:06] <solevita> IdleOne       yeah nice question     I'd better figure that out BEFORE asking for a driver :-D          sorry for disturbing ;)
[02:07] <Doow> Engrish: did you try instlinux?
[02:07] <Randakar> solevita: hold a sec
[02:07] <Engrish> don't know how to use it...plus it's for a spare computer
[02:07] <Randakar> solevita: First of all, 'drivers' are supposed to be part of either X or the linux kernel, not seperate downloads
[02:08] <Engrish> anyway i'll return later if i got another spare computer to play with
=== taylor__ is now known as LookTJ
[02:08] <solevita> IdleOne , Randakar           so..  the card is an ATI Radeon 9250
[02:09] <Randakar> solevita: Ok, does the card work? As in, do you have a desktop to start with?
[02:11] <osfameron> AARRRRGHHH!
[02:11] <osfameron> OOo is embarrassingly bad, still
[02:11] <osfameron> ubuntu is shiny, free software is shiny.  Why can't we have an office suite that doesn't suck?
[02:11] <frflame> hi
[02:12] <frflame> i want to ask something
[02:12] <frflame> now
[02:12] <frflame> erm
[02:12] <frflame> does ubuntu come with GRUBS?
[02:12] <frflame> I need the grubs
[02:12] <glaz> yes
[02:12] <frflame> maann I love the grubbs
[02:12] <frflame> D:
[02:12] <frflame> :P
[02:12] <solevita> Randakar    yes,   it works        BUT I got the feeling that the driver isn't configured right     or something..         lately I installed the KDE stuff      but as i wanted to try the transparency stuff for the window behaving settings   the computer says this: Composite extension not found
[02:12] <frflame> ;p
[02:12] <solevita> You must use XOrg  6.8 for translucency and shadows to work.
[02:12] <solevita> Additionally, you need to add a new section to your X config file:
[02:12] <solevita> Section "Extensions"
[02:12] <solevita> Option "Composite" "Enable"
[02:12] <solevita> EndSection
[02:13] <Randakar> solevita: that's straightforward advice
[02:13] <renzo17> lo
[02:13] <Randakar> solevita: trouble is, you have a driver, but not the proprietary one
[02:13] <solevita> Randakar:   aha!
[02:14] <Randakar> solevita: the X config file can be found in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:14] <solevita> Randakar:   then let me take a look ;)
[02:14] <Randakar> solevita: you can add those lines to enable the composite extension there, _but_ it doesn't neccesarily work without the non-free driver
[02:15] <caliga> how can i see my memory clock speed? is that somewhere in /proc?
[02:15] <caliga> lupine_85: nothing there...
[02:16] <matiseijas> hello... i've been trying to update ubuntu since yesterday with the method ' gksu "update-manager -c" ' and I can't... i get the following message:  " The application 'gksu' (/usr/bin/gksu) wants access to the default keyring, but it is locked. Enter password for default keyring to unlock " ... what should i do here? If i enter my sudo password it won't work...it must be another one...
[02:16] <caliga> lupine_85: modern you-cannot-damage-anything-BIOS ;)
[02:16] <Randakar> matiseijas: it's a password you added yourself .. tried just pressing 'enter'?
[02:16] <lupine_85> matiseijas: it's the password that you gave to the keyring when you created it
[02:16] <glaz> matiseijas: try sudo update-manager -c
[02:17] <lupine_85> caliga: should still be in there... somewhere... or on the POST screen
[02:17] <Randakar> glaz: that's not going to work from within X
[02:17] <Randakar> matiseijas: try 'gksudo' instead ;-)
[02:17] <lupine_85> I can't see anything in /proc right now
[02:17] <glaz> it works for me.
[02:17] <lupine_85> lol
[02:17] <Randakar> caliga: maybe look at the output of the 'dmesg' command
[02:17] <lupine_85> gui -> gksudo. Really.
[02:17] <matiseijas> yes! it worked! thank you all!
[02:18] <glaz> im not used to gksu*
[02:18] <lupine_85> mm, it's so hard to use :p
[02:18] <glaz> its like trying to switch from vi to nano.
[02:18] <Randakar> matiseijas: if you use 'gksu' you need to give the 'root' password, if you use 'gksudo' you need to use your own password
[02:18] <glaz> kinda impossible when you're used to something.
[02:18] <solevita> Randakar:    it's a bit embarresing but I can't find the xorg file   :(
[02:18] <matiseijas> oh!! i see... i get it now... thx
[02:19] <caliga> lupine_85: not sure i can deactivate spalsh to see POST...
[02:19] <caliga> Randakar: k
[02:19] <Randakar> solevita: try running 'gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[02:22] <brynk> hi, dumb question, how can i check the size of my swap partition?
[02:22] <solevita> Randakar:  yeah! now i understand!    thanks a lot!
[02:23] <IdleOne> whats the command to force open the cd-rom?
[02:23] <nolimitsoya> IdleOne, eject
[02:23] <IdleOne> cd /hammer/media/cdrom/open-MOFO right?
[02:24] <IdleOne> :P
[02:24] <Randakar> solevita: you're welcome :-)
[02:24] <nolimitsoya> IdleOne, more like 'eject <path>'
[02:25] <IdleOne> nolimitsoya,  Thank you that was simple enough
[02:25] <Randakar> brynk: not sure really ;-)
[02:25] <bubi> hi, im trying to write a shell script, my problem is i cant get the output, for example ifconfig | grep 10.1.10 gives me the HOLE line, but all i need is 10.1.10.xx  how can i do this ?
[02:26] <fenris> hi
[02:26] <Randakar> brynk: you could take a gander at /proc/meminfo. MemTotal would be your RAM + any swap space
[02:26] <glaz> bubi: use awk
[02:26] <bubi> glaz: i try..thx
[02:26] <glaz> ifconfig | grep 10.1.10 | awk print '{ $2 }'
[02:27] <glaz> if IP is 2nd word
[02:27] <Randakar> bubi: 'cut' would be the utility you want to use
[02:27] <brynk> Randakar: thanks, i also just noticed the swap size is listed using top
[02:27] <bubi> glaz: yeah but syntax error
[02:27] <fenris> can anyone tell me which version of xchat is in dapper? i have dapper and got xchat 2.6.1, but i know of someone else who has 2.6.6...
[02:27] <Randakar> ifconfig | grep 'inet addr' | cut -d ":" -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 1
[02:28] <nolimitsoya> fenris, 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade'
[02:28] <glaz> awk rocks cut.
[02:28] <Randakar> brynk: :-)
[02:28] <glaz> awk > cut
[02:28] <nolimitsoya> fenris, if that does fix it, enable the backports repo :)
[02:28] <nolimitsoya> fenris, if it still isnt fixed, youll need to install in manualy.
[02:28] <Randakar> glaz: cut is a few hundred times easier to understand
[02:28] <Randakar> glaz: when you reach for AWK, I reach for PERL ;-)
[02:28] <bubi> thank you both... im trying it
[02:29] <glaz> yeah, do you prefer easy to learn or reliable to use ?
[02:29] <glaz> :] 
[02:29] <anders__> hello, i'm trying to play enemy territory on ubuntu 6.10 i386, i have installed the game and i have tried to start the game, but it only manages to set screen resolution to very low, then fails with: "GLimp_Init() - could not load OpenGL" all i have found using google was a german site and i don't speak german :-(
[02:29] <nolimitsoya> anders__, what graphics card drivers are you using?
[02:29] <glaz> anders__: what video card you have?
[02:29] <Randakar> glaz: cut is reliable enough for simple things
[02:29] <glaz> Randakar true that.
[02:30] <glaz> Randakar: but i think when i started using linux cut didnt exist, so i got used to awk
[02:30] <glaz> which is pretty accurate
[02:30] <Randakar> glaz: hm, cut is quite old you know ;-)
[02:31] <glaz> im quite older i guess!
[02:31] <solevita> anders__ : do you still have the link?  i speak german and have the same problem  (maybe i can even explain the what to do ;) )
[02:31] <bubi> Randakar , glaz : hmm im trying it with cut.. :) it looks easier :D
[02:31] <Randakar> solevita: your problem is lack of openGL support in your video driver ;-)
[02:32] <fenris> nolimitsoya: ok, enabling the backports did it, thx
[02:32] <glaz> solevita: get nvidia-glx install and switch nv to nvidia in xorg.conf
[02:32] <nolimitsoya> fenris, np :)
[02:32] <Randakar> bubi: when you get a bit further, learn regular expressions. Perl or sed, doesn't matter, but regular expressions are the power drill of the unix command line
[02:32] <Randakar> glaz: solevita has an ATI card ;-)
[02:32] <solevita> Randakar:     no, that's not it..  'cause on the box here it says:  that it DOES have Open GL     and some more stuff.. but tv-out and all that is not my thing
[02:32] <glaz> damn i must go to sleep i red nvidia :/
[02:32] <Rodietze> hey dudes, do u know a good sql backend that runs on UBuntu?
[02:33] <bubi> Randakar: im just trying, i dont realy want to do something complex but i will remember :)(
[02:33] <Randakar> solevita: Your card supports it, the driver just doesn't know how to enable it
[02:33] <solevita> glaz: :-D
[02:33] <anders__> nolimitsoya: nv driver in xorg.conf
[02:33] <Rodietze> I mean MS SQL server backend so that I can administrate a remote database
[02:33] <glaz> solevita: dont consider what i said.
[02:33] <glaz> i tough you had a good video card :] 
[02:33] <solevita> Randakar:   I see..
[02:33] <anders__> solevita: great! yes it is http://www.linuxforen.de/forums/archive/index.php/t-162443.html
[02:34] <nolimitsoya> anders__, 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config'
[02:34] <solevita> :-D   it's not the best videocard    but it's not bad ;)
[02:34] <nolimitsoya> anders__, cut and paste that to a terminal
[02:34] <glaz> nv > ati
[02:34] <interskh> hi! does anyone here install Altera Quartus6? i have some problems
[02:35] <Ritzzo> hi
[02:35] <anders__> nolimitsoya: nvidia-glx is already the newest version.
[02:35] <nolimitsoya> anders__, yes, but is nvidia-glx-config run?
[02:36] <Ritzzo> anyone have problems with ps/2 mouse on laptop ? i cant configure it and touchpad works fine but i need mouse
[02:37] <interskh> command "bindkey" does not exist in csh, but the install needs it
[02:37] <glaz> Randakar: i just started using ubuntu yesterday tho..
[02:37] <interskh> and i found "bindkey" is available in freebsd
[02:37] <lewyjh> is there anywhere where i can get a list of drivers i need? most importantly for my network card and cd drive? heh heh
[02:38] <glaz> lewyjh: what is your network card ?
[02:39] <solevita> anders__ : the ichunddu guy says that GLX and the composite-option don't work together..     that guy with the problem had recompiled his xorg file..
[02:39] <interskh> what can i do now?
[02:40] <solevita> anders__ :  but that doesn't makes me any smarter :-D   rather more confused :-
[02:40] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: was ps2 mouse plugged in before boot?
[02:40] <Randakar> glaz: So what did you use before? other linuxes?
[02:40] <glaz> Randakar: nah, free/open BSD
[02:40] <lewyjh> glaz, well, linux device manager says its...uhh...BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g]  802.11g
[02:41] <Randakar> solevita: Look for a set of ATI driver installation instructions on the net
[02:41] <frying_fish> don't need that with ubuntu
[02:41] <frying_fish> there is a packaged ati driver in linux-restricted-modules
[02:41] <apsuva> how to change splash screen?
[02:41] <frying_fish> !ati
[02:41] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:41] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: i never use. touchpad works fine and i see if psmouse module is on, and its is. then change xorg.conf for imps2 and devide mouse0 psaux mice mouse tts0 and don work this mouse :(
[02:41] <frying_fish> or look there for it.
[02:41] <Randakar> glaz: Ah, BSD. Respectable, but misguided ;-)
[02:42] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: needs to be connected before start up
[02:42] <frying_fish> ps2 kit isn't hotpluggable from what I remember
[02:42] <glaz> Randakar: and not desktop oriented
[02:42] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: is connected
[02:42] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: reboot the machine.
[02:42] <frying_fish> see if it works then.
[02:42] <solevita> Randakar:   I'm on it ;)
[02:42] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: i do many times
[02:42] <Randakar> frying_fish: thanks, I was wondering if there was a question bot around ;-)
[02:42] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: and dont work
[02:42] <Xzyx987X> anyone know how to add a service to the service list in gnome's service manager? I installed tor, but it didn't get put on the list
[02:42] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: reboot, then run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:42] <frying_fish> and see if that helps configure it.
[02:43] <apsuva> help me pls. how to change splash screen?
[02:43] <Randakar> solevita: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:43] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: i do :D sorry and dont help me
[02:43] <Xzyx987X> or if there's a better ubuntu service manager I'm open to suggestions
[02:43] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: i think i go compile kernel and see
[02:43] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: does it show up anywhere? recompiling the kernel most likely won't help
[02:43] <lewyjh> should i just google a pacage of ati drivers?
[02:44] <frying_fish> can you detect the input from the mouse anywhere in the system.
[02:44] <frying_fish> lewyjh: no, look at the following link:
[02:44] <frying_fish> !ati
[02:44] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:44] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: i dont understant the last sentence
[02:44] <anders__> nolimitsoya: $ sudo /usr/sbin/nvidia-glx-config enable says "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel." but i have installed nvidia-glx...
[02:44] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: i know but see the support of mouse
[02:44] <Ritzzo> y havent conf of linux-image here
[02:45] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: so it shows somewhere on the system. i.e. it is there with lspci or the approrpiate command
[02:45] <lewyjh> frying_fish, i need a driver for my wireless network card, not my video card.
[02:45] <frying_fish> so why are you after an ati driver?
[02:45] <wijnand> where did the menu editor go that i had in dapper? ever since i upgraded to edgy i can't find it anymore...
[02:46] <frying_fish> and the "driver" for your wireless card will either be in the kernel or not (so you don't need to download it) if it isn't, then you will most likely need ndiswrapper and the windows "driver" for it.
[02:46] <nolimitsoya> anders__, 'sudo apt-get install kernel-headers-'uname -r'
[02:46] <anders__> solevita: yeah, same here..
[02:46] <lewyjh> i have no idea, i was only asking if someone could point me in the direction of a driver for this device...BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g]  802.11g
[02:46] <frying_fish> wijnand: system->preferences->menu layout
[02:46] <apsuva> i m downloaded this splash screen = http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=39874 but how to install splash screen
[02:46] <nolimitsoya> anders__, sorry, 'sudo apt-get install kernel-headers-`uname -r`'
[02:47] <frying_fish> lewyjh: if it has detected it as that from some command in linux already then it is working.
[02:47] <anders__> nolimitsoya: thanks, but i get "E: Couldn't find package kernel-headers-2.6.17-10-generic"
[02:48] <anders__> nolimitsoya: i'm doing something wrong(?)
[02:48] <rambo3> php5-curl borken package , can anyone confirm this?
[02:48] <Randakar> apsuva: interesting stuff, no clue how to install that. Maybe somebody on #gnome knows ..
[02:48] <nolimitsoya> !headers
[02:48] <ubotu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages
[02:48] <lewyjh> frying_fish that's what its detected as in "device manager"
[02:48] <apsuva> thanks r0bby
[02:48] <apsuva> ups
[02:49] <apsuva> thanks Randakar
[02:49] <nolimitsoya> anders__, ah, they might still be called linux-headers for you. :) running dapper?
[02:49] <frying_fish> lewyjh: in which case it has already found it and you don't need a driver.
[02:49] <bubi> hmm how can i redirect the output to an array ? cat dump | grep 10.1 | cut -d " " -f 4 | cut -d ":" -f 1 > ${hosts[@] } doesnt work :(
[02:49] <nolimitsoya> anders__, try 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`' instead
[02:49] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: well dmesg only show touchpad, but this laptop use mouse on windows without problems. convencional mouse
[02:49] <lewyjh> frying_fish, damnit...i wish i had an easy button to get wireless internet.
[02:49] <Randakar> bubi: an array?
[02:50] <shoman> hello all
[02:50] <Randakar> bubi: no such things as 'arrays' in shell programming ;-)
[02:50] <frying_fish> lewyjh: sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
[02:50] <shoman> I have a question ..if anybody help then It will be really appreciated
[02:50] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: ok, then you need to find its event location, and make sure you are using that for the mouse in xorg
[02:50] <Ritzzo> mdetect show psuax intelligmouse
[02:50] <frying_fish> and set it to imps2
[02:50] <bubi> Randakar: hmm dont know the english name.. in C it is variable[10]  then you have 10 variables variable[0]  variable[1] ....
[02:50] <Randakar> bubi: what you just did directed the output to a file
[02:50] <shoman> ANYBODY
=== Cosmosan is now known as Cosmo-san
[02:50] <Randakar> shoman: ask
[02:51] <shoman> OK thank YOU
[02:51] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: on xorg.conf i put ImPS/2
[02:51] <frying_fish> do you have the correct input event
[02:51] <Ritzzo> device?
[02:51] <frying_fish> not the correct type, the correct /dev place for it
[02:51] <frying_fish> probably /dev/mouse or something.
[02:51] <shoman> actually I have a problem that my monitor is  bit old
[02:51] <bubi> Randakar: hm i have filtered 10 ips know i want to mount them in a loop, but to do this i need them in an variable...
[02:52] <Chousuke> ash has arrays
[02:52] <shoman> and its not showing any other resolution than 640*480
[02:52] <Chousuke> er
[02:52] <Chousuke> bash*
[02:52] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: /dev/mouse dont exist
[02:52] <anders__> nolimitsoya: running edgy i386
[02:52] <shoman> when installing ubuntu
[02:52] <frying_fish> Ritzzo: thats why I said "or something"
[02:52] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: but /dev7input/mouse0 yes and put but dont work
[02:52] <frying_fish> you need to find the correct one.
[02:52] <Ash-Fox> Help, I have arrays!
[02:52] <shoman> so I want to install through some command ??
[02:52] <shoman> IS THERE ANY?
[02:52] <lewyjh> frying_fish, that's a program right?
[02:52] <Ash-Fox> !apt-get
[02:52] <ubotu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[02:52] <frying_fish> become root and do evtest /dev/input/mouse0 and move the mouse, see if it does anything.
[02:52] <frying_fish> lewyjh: yeah, for easy network management for wireless.
[02:53] <lewyjh> where do i find it once i installed it?
[02:53] <Chousuke> but redirecting to arrays is not possible.
[02:53] <lewyjh> i just did...
[02:53] <lewyjh> heh heh
[02:53] <Chousuke> redirection only works for files.
[02:53] <frying_fish> lewyjh: re-login to you session
[02:53] <frying_fish> and see if a little applet shows in the panel
[02:53] <frying_fish> if not, run nm-applet
[02:53] <lewyjh> or just do a killall gnome-panel?
[02:53] <frying_fish> and then close it, log out and log back in
[02:53] <shoman> Randakar: ?????
[02:53] <anders__> nolimitsoya: runnning "sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`" outputs "linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic is already the newest version."
[02:53] <frying_fish> it might need to bre at the start of a session.
[02:54] <frying_fish> anders__: the problem isn't that you don't have the headers.
[02:54] <Ritzzo> frying_fish: evtest?
[02:54] <frying_fish> tests the event
[02:54] <frying_fish> or just cat it Ritzzo
[02:54] <shoman> Randakar: YOU THERE
[02:54] <frying_fish> should get some garbled stuff coming out to the terminal.
[02:54] <bubi> shoman: you dont want the graphical installer
[02:54] <frying_fish> shoman: stop shouting.
[02:54] <bubi> shoman : right ?
[02:54] <shoman> yyeah I dont want the GUI installer
[02:54] <lewyjh> frying_fish, once i do re-log where will it be? ha
[02:55] <LeanCalPer> join #ubuntu-lat
[02:55] <frying_fish> in the panel
[02:55] <bubi> shoman: then take the alternate cd....
[02:55] <frying_fish> it will be some computer type thing.
[02:55] <lewyjh> but where? under apps places or system?
[02:55] <bubi> shoman: or the dvd
[02:55] <frying_fish> click on it, see if it sees anything for wireless
[02:55] <Randakar> back
[02:55] <Chousuke> bubi: if you can save the IPs you qant to mount into a single variable, separated by spaces, you can use "for ip in $variable; do; something; done"
[02:55] <shoman> lol from where...
[02:55] <frying_fish> no, an applet in the panel
[02:55] <playa> How do i mount NTFS partition and access tthem without getting "Permission denied"
[02:55] <frying_fish> not under amenu.
[02:55] <shoman> its comes with bootable CD
[02:55] <frying_fish> directly on the panel itself
[02:55] <frying_fish> like the clock
[02:55] <lewyjh> oh, its those two computers...
[02:55] <lewyjh> that blink.
[02:55] <frying_fish> maybe
[02:55] <frying_fish> probably not actually
[02:55] <Ritzzo> i hate this
[02:55] <bubi> shoman: hmm you are not trying to install ubuntu ?
[02:56] <Ritzzo> i understant waht happend
[02:56] <frying_fish> thats possibly the default one that is has, that isn't the right thing.
[02:56] <Ritzzo> arf
[02:56] <FreeNet> hi guys!!! i love Ubuntu!
[02:56] <lewyjh> oh...good because i already have that thing.
[02:56] <shoman> I'm trying but I couldnt get through because of resolution
[02:56] <frying_fish> you want the one that looks similar, but is different
[02:56] <DARKGuy> Mornin' :)
[02:56] <frying_fish> get rid of that first one from your panel anyway
[02:56] <frying_fish> you don't need it with this other one
[02:56] <bubi> Chousuke, hmm i can save them in a file so it should work with a variable either
[02:56] <bubi> shoman: then download the ubuntu image from a mirror
[02:56] <Randakar> shoman: sorry, I'm at work so may stop responding at any time ;-)
[02:56] <anders__> frying_fish: ok, then what is the problem?
[02:57] <shoman> I have downloaded as well
[02:57] <frying_fish> anders__: lsmod | grep nvidia
[02:57] <shoman> but you are not telling me the command ?
[02:57] <frying_fish> see if that pulls up the nvidia thing
[02:57] <Chousuke> bubi: well, you can just read the file line by line or something
[02:57] <anders__> frying_fish: no output :S
[02:57] <shoman> if there any
[02:57] <frying_fish> it would also help if you are in X and running it using the nvidia driver
[02:57] <Chousuke> bubi: or save to a variable
[02:57] <Randakar> shoman: the command to do what?
[02:57] <bubi> shoman: then download the ALTERNATE cd... it has such an installer
[02:57] <Chousuke> bubi: there are many ways to do that.
[02:57] <frying_fish> if you don't have the nvidia driver loaded, then thats why its giving you that error.
[02:57] <shoman> to Install UBUNTU
[02:57] <bubi> Chousuke:  hmm i try,
[02:57] <anders__> frying_fish: so strange because i am in gnome now with 1440x900 res or something
[02:57] <frying_fish> shoman: stop using caps lock, and listen to the sensible advice.
[02:58] <frying_fish> anders__: you could be using nv
[02:58] <anders__> frying_fish: and in xorg.conf i have set "nv" for driver
[02:58] <Randakar> shoman: frying fish is probably right :-)
[02:58] <shoman> yeah yeah I'm trying ok...so dont shout
[02:58] <frying_fish> anders__: yeah you have the wrong driver
[02:58] <anders__> frying_fish: oh i thought nv was correct
[02:58] <frying_fish> you don't want "nv" you want "nvidia"
[02:58] <nolimitsoya> anders__, did you run nvidia-glx-config as i asked you? did you restart x?
[02:58] <bubi> shoman: the normal ubuntu image has only an graphic installer.... the alternate also got an console gui
[02:58] <frying_fish> thats why the nvidia-glx-config wasn't working.
[02:58] <anders__> frying_fish: i don't know the difference
[02:58] <user-land> How can i change permissions so i can write to my new external USB harddisk partition ?
[02:58] <anders__> nolimitsoya: yes but it failed to start
[02:58] <Randakar> anders__: I have two entries for 'device' in xorg.conf, one with 'nv' and one with 'nvidia' driver
[02:58] <FreeNet> guys does ubuntu use "rpm" excutable?
[02:59] <lewyjh> hey frying_fish, i got that applet...it can't detect any network devices...
[02:59] <frying_fish> anders__: sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf and the :%s/nv/nvidia/
[02:59] <frying_fish> and save.
[02:59] <jrib> FreeNet: no, it uses deb
[02:59] <Randakar> FreeNet: No, but you can install them anyway using alien or RPM
[02:59] <frogzoo> !alien | FreeNet
[02:59] <ubotu> FreeNet: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[02:59] <frying_fish> lewyjh: right click, select enable wireless
[02:59] <anders__> frying_fish: will do
[02:59] <frying_fish> oh, hang on, did you have stuff set in /etc/network/interfaces for the wireless card?
[02:59] <frying_fish> as if so it may not work
[02:59] <lewyjh> frying_fish, no option.
[02:59] <frying_fish> !network-manager
[02:59] <ubotu> networkmanager is an application to make (wireless) networking Just Work. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[02:59] <frying_fish> have a look at that wiki
[02:59] <frying_fish> it should help
[03:00] <frying_fish> anders__: be careful with that vim command, incase it messes up something other things, basically just change nv for nvidia where it is used
=== doki is now known as doki|away
[03:00] <anders__> frying_fish: yes i'm aware
[03:00] <user-land>  /media/usb1 is owned by root, how can i change its permissions ?
[03:00] <lewyjh> yeah, thanks frying_fish. seriously, your the only one so far that's acctually helped me at all on this channel haha
[03:00] <frying_fish> user-land: by being root.....
[03:00] <playa> Has anyone an idea why sound works, though volume and recording doesn't?
[03:01] <anders__> frying_fish: should i restart x now and try running  nvidia-glx-config again?
[03:01] <frying_fish> anders__: yes
[03:01] <user-land> what command, frying_fish ?
[03:01] <frying_fish> although, you shouldn't need to
[03:01] <frying_fish> user-land: to become root? or to change the permissions,
[03:01] <Randakar> lewyjh: hey, I'm also here to get something fixed, but so far I've only ended up answering questions ;-)
[03:01] <user-land> to change the permissions, frying_fish.
[03:01] <frying_fish> user-land: do you want it owned by your user? with its current permissions?
[03:02] <frying_fish> if so: sudo chown -R USER:GROUP /meda/usb1
[03:02] <FreeNet> ok thanks... i'll take a look at RPM.. but if let's say when i surf the net and wants to download some program for linux... what kind shd i go for? TarGz? Deb? RPM?
[03:02] <user-land> i would like every computer i connect it to to be able to write to it.
[03:02] <frying_fish> user-land: thats dependent on the computer
[03:02] <frying_fish> not the usb disk
[03:02] <snail> user-land: read the man page for mount
[03:02] <Randakar> FreeNet: Go for adding more channels to /etc/apt/sources.list :-)
[03:03] <anurag_> does any knows any specifc proxie for irc and client
[03:03] <frying_fish> FreeNet: deb
[03:03] <Randakar> FreeNet: That way stuff keeps auto-updating when new releases go out
[03:03] <bubi> Randakar : look query plz.. for a sec if you have time :)
[03:03] <Randakar> bubi: query?
[03:03] <user-land> owned by my user, yes, frying_fish.
[03:03] <FreeNet> ok... good thanks. I am considering install Avast 4 Linux Home Edition onto my ubuntu
[03:03] <bubi> Randakar: private chat :)
[03:04] <user-land> snail, i want it to mount automatically
[03:04] <frying_fish> user-land: that is computer dependent! if you plug it into another computer, the permissions on its system will have to be set
[03:04] <Randakar> bubi: sorry, haven't seen anything
[03:04] <Randakar> bubi: too much scrolling I guess :-)
[03:04] <frying_fish> especially if that user has a different name on that system
[03:04] <user-land> frying_fish, how can i set the permissions so i can write to it now ?
[03:05] <frying_fish> but, the command I gave you will set it to the right ones for now
[03:05] <frying_fish> user-land: I already gave you the command.
[03:05] <bubi> Randakar: :) it should be a window but, just look at this http://www.tech-recipes.com/bourne_shell_scripting_tips636.html  this is what i want. :)
[03:06] <raskar> plop
[03:06] <KenSentMe> Is there a cli tool to convert .ods files (openoffice) to ms Excel's .xls extension?
[03:06] <Randakar> bubi: ah, I see
[03:07] <frying_fish> KenSentMe: no
[03:07] <Randakar> bubi: so far I've never actually needed shell arrays for anything ;-)
[03:07] <KenSentMe> frying_fish: ok :)
[03:07] <raskar> go perf #-saint- sur quakenet
[03:07] <DARKGuy> Yay! new nvidia drivers! :D
[03:07] <frying_fish> KenSentMe: unfortunately.
[03:07] <DARKGuy> Bug fix! :D
[03:07] <Randakar> bubi: but I must admit, if it gets too complicated I revert to perl ;-)
[03:07] <frying_fish> DARKGuy: in l-r-m? and what release numb ers.
[03:07] <KenSentMe> frying_fish: do you know of a plugin for opening ods files in Excel?
[03:08] <DARKGuy> frying_fish: nah, nVIDIA's site, 9631... says they fixed the bug about X crashing with everything
[03:08] <frying_fish> KenSentMe: nope.
[03:08] <KenSentMe> frying_fish: ok, ty
[03:08] <frying_fish> DARKGuy: oh ok, maybe it will end up in some l-r-m with beryl people soon.
[03:08] <cheesy> how can i get my Audigy2 Remote to work?
[03:08] <frying_fish> KenSentMe: you have to manually convert.
[03:08] <DARKGuy> frying_fish: Most probably ;)
[03:08] <bubi> Randakar: hm it isnt complicated but i dont know the right way ;) coming from C++ everything is different :D i just have a file with 10 IPs each row.. and this ips i want to mount like mount -t smbfs //$ip for example
[03:09] <frying_fish> DARKGuy: hope so, the 64bit one usually ends up a bit behind though, would be nice to have the non-black windows all the time.
[03:09] <Randakar> bubi: at any rate, for what you want you should do something like: interfaces = $( `ifconfig | ....` )
[03:09] <bubi> Randakar: hmm i try :)
[03:09] <DARKGuy> frying_fish: Aw, I noticed ): then again, they're different architectures to program on :p
[03:10] <Randakar> bubi: perl would be more C-like for you ;-)
[03:10] <frying_fish> true, but I mean, once the driver is out, it still is a while before it will be in lupines repos.
[03:10] <Randakar> bubi: but then you might also consider using CSH (C-Shell)
[03:10] <frying_fish> DARKGuy: I would do it manually, but I am a bit lazy.
[03:10] <bubi> Randakar: hmm today shell tomorrow perl :) i promise ;)
[03:11] <DARKGuy> frying_fish: that's normal :P
[03:11] <FreeNet> Hi how dow i switch user to root in ubuntu? "su -" is not working
[03:11] <frying_fish> indeed, I moved to ubuntu to be more lazy (and to have things actually work)
[03:11] <frying_fish> FreeNet: sudo -s
[03:11] <Randakar> bubi: no need to promise, just saying perl is very very very powerfull when it comes to this sort of thing
[03:11] <jrib> !root | FreeNet
[03:11] <ubotu> FreeNet: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:11] <frying_fish> or if you particularily want to use su, then sudo passwd root to set the root password, then just su afterwards
[03:12] <cheesy> how can i get my audigy2 remote to work?
[03:12] <bubi> Randakar: hm maybe :) i will try it tomorrow :D i have to learn for school anyway :)
[03:12] <FreeNet> thanks
[03:12] <Randakar> frying_fish: I dislike sudo, frankly. I tend to do 10-20 commands as root, then sudo is just inefficient
[03:12] <DARKGuy> Brb
[03:12] <frying_fish> Randakar: not really inefficient
[03:12] <umer> which version of linux is used in ubuntu
[03:12] <jrib> Randakar: sudo -i   for that
[03:12] <frying_fish> I do sudo -s if I plan on doing lots of things as root
[03:13] <frying_fish> or sudo -i then you are just given a root shell, you could even do sudo bash
[03:13] <frying_fish> then go from there
[03:13] <Randakar> frying_fish: sudo bash :-)
[03:13] <frying_fish> same result in the end.
[03:13] <frying_fish> sudo -s is less characters than sudo bash though
[03:13] <Randakar> frying_fish: true enough.
[03:13] <Randakar> umer: the kernel, you mean? Depends on the version of ubuntu. 6.10 uses 2.6.17 AFAIK
[03:14] <Randakar> frying_fish: "su -" is even less characters :-)
[03:14] <jrib> alias s='sudo -i' is even less :)
[03:14] <frying_fish> Randakar: true, but, since root isn't enabled by default.
[03:14] <toppredator> ok
[03:14] <FreeNet> lol
[03:14] <toppredator> I have a question
[03:14] <Randakar> jrib: haha
[03:14] <frying_fish> jrib: that has problems if you don't mean to type it though.
[03:14] <toppredator> how do you use the IBM biometric scan with Ubuntu
[03:14] <toppredator> ?
[03:15] <Randakar> frying_fish: yeah, that's why I don't recommend it to people who are just starting ;-)
[03:15] <Randakar> toppredator: did you just say 'biometric scan' ?
[03:15] <FreeNet> guys u all heard yum right? the GUI of yum is called yumex... is there a gui for apt?
[03:15] <Randakar> FreeNet: Synaptic
[03:15] <jrib> FreeNet: synaptic, adept, add/remove programs
[03:15] <soundray> FreeNet: several
[03:16] <toppredator> Yeah radkar
[03:16] <toppredator> Hangon
[03:16] <Randakar> jrib: I dislike add/remove programs frankly .. it gives up and points to synaptic too easily
[03:16] <Randakar> jrib: without even specifying where to _find_ synaptic
[03:16] <FreeNet> ok thanks.. i just migrate from CentOS.
[03:16] <Jewbird> Hello users and fans of Ubuntu
[03:16] <jrib> Randakar: me too, I prefer using aptitude or apt-get
[03:17] <toppredator> radkar
[03:17] <toppredator> *randkar
[03:17] <toppredator> **Randakar
[03:17] <umer> to downnload adobe reader they were asking the version.targz or .rpm
[03:17] <toppredator> Its the fingerprint scan
[03:17] <frying_fish> I personally use aptitude for a lot, except sometimes I will use synaptic for if I am being a bit lazy and want to read about things before installing them.
[03:17] <jrib> !info acroread | umer
[03:17] <ubotu> acroread: Adobe Acrobat Reader: Portable Document Format file viewer. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 7.0.8-0.0.ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 22368 kB, installed size 54692 kB (Only available for i386)
[03:17] <Randakar> toppredator: I guess it's a matter of a hardware driver + installing a PAM module, but I've never heard of such a thing ;-)
[03:17] <frying_fish> umer: there is acrobat in the apt soruces
[03:17] <frying_fish> umer: sudo apt-get install acroread
[03:18] <soundray> !multiverse | umer
[03:18] <ubotu> umer: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[03:18] <Randakar> frying_fish: I'd make that 'aptitude install acroread'
[03:18] <toppredator> its the built in IBM T43 thinkpad finger print scan :/
[03:18] <frying_fish> Randakar: well yeah, sometimes I do that
[03:18] <soundray> umer: you will need to have multiverse enabled to install acroread via apt-get
[03:18] <Randakar> frying_fish: apt-get is nice, but it doesn't mark dependencies as automatically installed (which is logical because it doesn't know about that)
[03:18] <frying_fish> it depends what my fingers are thinking at that time.
[03:18] <frying_fish> Randakar: true.
[03:18] <frying_fish> I try to use aptitude when I remember
[03:19] <slicky> what the big difference between ubuntu intel x86 and AMD64?
[03:19] <Randakar> frying_fish: I recently did a cleanup where every installed package was marked as automatically installed, unless I decided it wasn't ;-)
[03:19] <frying_fish> Randakar: :)
[03:19] <Randakar> frying_fish: that got rid of a _lot_ of lib*-dev packages
[03:19] <soundray> slicky: amd64 uses the 64bit capability of Athlon64, Opteron and Core Duo CPUs.
[03:20] <frying_fish> slicky: what? rephrase that into a sensible question.
[03:20] <frying_fish> Randakar: I suppose I should go through at some point and get rid of all the stuff I don't need.
[03:20] <thepianoguy> how do I join #python?
[03:20] <slicky> soundray, okey, so all the 32 bit applications work aswell on the amd64 version?
[03:20] <jrib> thepianoguy: /join #python
[03:20] <thepianoguy> it says You need to be identified to join that channel
[03:20] <jrib> !register | thepianoguy
[03:20] <ubotu> thepianoguy: Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[03:20] <thepianoguy> thanks! :)
[03:20] <soundray> slicky: yes, if you install the appropriate 32bit libraries.
[03:21] <soundray> slicky: but normally you'll be happier with a i386 install
[03:21] <thepianoguy> hm.. it doesn't work
[03:21] <thepianoguy> !register command
[03:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about register command - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:21] <slicky> soundray, okey.. ill go for the i386 then ;D
[03:21] <soundray> slicky: amd64 is good for heavy computation, e.g. video recoding.
[03:22] <Rainarrow> Hi there
[03:22] <frying_fish> slicky: if you have the libraries, or there are most likely 64bit variants, what particular 32bit app are you after\?
[03:22] <Rainarrow> Anyone here running Ubuntu on a Thinkpad?
[03:22] <frying_fish> on my 64bit desktop I only have 32 firefox, wine and acroread (through some hacking of the start up script)
[03:22] <soundray> Rainarrow: is that a survey or a support request?
[03:22] <FreeNet> ubuntu don't support FreeNX?
[03:22] <sysdoc> lol
[03:22] <Randakar> !freenx
[03:22] <ubotu> FreeNX is advanced remote desktop technology. For more information and install instructions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
[03:23] <w3ccv> are there any good lighweight firewalols for Edgy?
[03:23] <Rainarrow> soundray, it's a support request, thanks
[03:23] <slicky> ow well .. ill go by the 32 bit version
[03:23] <frying_fish> soundray: thats bull, you will be just as happy with 64bit, and tbh, if you have the capabilities for it you should use it.
[03:23] <Randakar> !thinkpad
[03:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thinkpad - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:23] <soundray> Rainarrow: why don't you ask a support question, then.
[03:23] <frying_fish> slicky: what specifically do you need from 32bit?
[03:23] <Rainarrow> soundray, it's a easyone, everytime I startup my T40 my wireless is powered up
[03:23] <Randakar> I like answer bots :-)
[03:23] <Rainarrow> soundray, even I deactivate it or leave it unconfigured
[03:23] <frying_fish> as firefox 32bit is easy enough, wine is easy enough and acroread is just about easy enough (and there are plenty of other pdf viewers, i.e. evince)
[03:23] <slicky> frying_fish, well ..like the most things.. wine.. amsn n stuff
[03:23] <Rainarrow> soundray, I have to press Fn+F5 to turn it off everytime I startup
[03:23] <frying_fish> amsn is 64bit capable
[03:24] <frying_fish> you can install 32bit wine on 64bit linux
[03:24] <Randakar> Rainarrow: Normally the kernel will auto-load modules for every device you have
[03:24] <frying_fish> there is even a thread on how to do it.
[03:24] <slicky> but is the 64bit faster and more stable then the 32bit?
[03:24] <lewyjh> i looked through the wiki...i just don't think mmy laptop will ever have wirelss with ubuntu...
[03:24] <Rainarrow> Hi Randakar, thanks for your attention
[03:24] <soundray> Rainarrow: I would try blacklisting the module for the interface
[03:24] <soundray> !blacklist
[03:24] <ubotu> To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add "blacklist modulename" to the end of that list
[03:24] <frying_fish> slicky: just as stable, but its a better use of your processors abilities
[03:25] <thepianoguy> ok, found it
[03:25] <slicky> frying_fish,  okey.. like in games?
[03:25] <Rainarrow> soundray, I could see a "ipw2100" in the output of lsmod
[03:25] <Randakar> Rainarrow: that may not be what you want since it permanently disables automatically loading the module
[03:25] <soundray> Rainarrow: prime candidate
[03:25] <frying_fish> slicky: what games are you thinking of here, most are windows based and thus won't work anyway (wine still doesn't play 95% of games)
[03:26] <slicky> frying_fish, like nexuiz :$
[03:26] <frying_fish> and if a game is coded in 32bit then it doesn't matter anyway, if like Half life 2 there is a 64bit version, that is going to be a better use of resources.
[03:26] <lewyjh> frying_fish is there a way to check if my network card is running alright with konsol or something?
[03:26] <Rainarrow> Can I let the system initialize the wireless as a poweredoff state?
[03:26] <soundray> Randakar: I think that *is* what Rainarrow wants. He can always 'modprobe ipw2100' when (s)he needs it.
[03:26] <Rainarrow> OK, I'll test
[03:26] <Randakar> soundray: yeah, just wondering, never heard of this blacklist before ;-)
[03:27] <slicky> frying_fish, okey, ill try the 64 bit version then.. is there much documentation on it as well?
[03:27] <Randakar> sounds useful
[03:27] <frying_fish> lewyjh: iwconfig
[03:27] <frying_fish> man iwconfig
[03:27] <Rainarrow> The ideal solution for me would be to let my system poweroff the wireless when it loads the module
[03:27] <Rainarrow> so when I need it I just need a Fn+F5
[03:27] <frying_fish> documentation on what? 64bit ? same as 32bit.....
[03:27] <Rainarrow> soundray, it's a he, hoho
[03:27] <frying_fish> its not a totally different system
[03:27] <Rainarrow> Is this possible?
[03:27] <frying_fish> just things have been compiled 64bit.
[03:27] <soundray> Rainarrow: that would be a driver feature. You'd have to read the docs and possibly the driver sources to work out whether an approach like that is supported.
[03:28] <slicky> frying_fish,  okey.. so.. if i download a source can i compile it to 64bit ?
[03:28] <lewyjh> frying_fish, is this good or bad? eth1      IEEE 802.11b/g  ESSID:"wireless"  Nickname:"Broadcom 4318"
[03:28] <lewyjh>           Mode:Managed  Access Point: Invalid   Bit Rate=1 Mb/s
[03:28] <lewyjh>           RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
[03:28] <lewyjh>           Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
[03:28] <lewyjh>           Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
[03:28] <lewyjh>           Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0
[03:28] <soundray> lewyjh: this is BAD
[03:28] <Rainarrow> OK soundray, I see
[03:28] <soundray> lewyjh: you're not meant to paste stuff in here.
[03:28] <Randakar> Rainarrow: It's always possible, just not neccesarily easy for a non-programmer ;-)
[03:28] <frying_fish> slicky: yes.
[03:28] <frying_fish> lewjthats working.
[03:28] <Rainarrow> soundray, Randakar, thanks
[03:29] <frying_fish> i.e. you have wireless capability with your card, just your not connected to anything.
[03:29] <lewyjh> frying_fish even though the managed access point is invalid?
[03:29] <Rainarrow> Randakar, well, unfortunely I have litttle programming experience, :(
[03:29] <soundray> Rainarrow: you could check whether FnF5 generates a system event, and make it load the module if it does.
[03:29] <Gumby> lewyjh: sometimes that card works with ubuntu native drivers and other times it needs ndiswrapper to work
[03:29] <frying_fish> you don't appear to be connected to anything, do iwlist eth1 scan produce any results?
[03:29] <slicky> frying_fish, thats great, is it made automatically with make or do i have to do it some other way?
[03:29] <lewyjh> gumby i already added ndiswrapper in the boot file thing, i edited it with konsol.
[03:30] <frying_fish> go read up on it. I can't give you all the details on it. I'm not here to explain exactly how 64bit and 32bit systems work.
[03:30] <Rainarrow> soundray, sounds it possible to do that with a script
[03:30] <Gumby> lewyjh: great.  do as frying_fish suggests
[03:30] <Toma-> anyone use dosbox? is there a way to make it run faster/better other than upping the cycles?
[03:30] <Rainarrow> I'll google around a little, so thanks for all your help
[03:30] <Rainarrow> :P
[03:30] <frying_fish> time to go, I have a dragonforce gig to be at.
[03:30] <slicky> frying_fish, aiit.. thanks
[03:30] <lewyjh> nice.
[03:31] <soundray> Rainarrow: Google is probably useful, and check out Tuxmobil as well
[03:31] <vittorio> hi, i would like to copy data to a nonblocking device. is there a unix command that can handle nonblocking device? (cp cant it seems)
[03:31] <Randakar> Toma-: Yeah, I used it. Not sure about speeding it up though, it's more or less an emulator for old DOS hardware (and DOS, of course :-) )
[03:31] <lewyjh> so i have this light on my Hp laptop, that used to light up when my wireless card was activated...should that still light up when my card is activated in unbuntu?
[03:31] <blaa> nolimitsoya: hi
[03:31] <Rainarrow> oh, there is another thingy
[03:31] <Gumby> lewyjh: you'll have to press the button, sometimes for a few seconds until it lights up
[03:31] <nolimitsoya> blaa :)
[03:31] <Toma-> Randakar: yeh, im trying to run dungeon keeper on it, but its slow as hell :<
[03:31] <soundray> vittorio: you mean a character device? Try cat file >/dev/something
[03:32] <Randakar> Toma-: hehe, yes it does that
[03:32] <Rainarrow> How to disable write cache on usb storage devices?
[03:32] <Gumby> lewyjh: I have an HP/compaq as well and its probably quite similar in how it functions
[03:32] <Toma-> Randakar: do you think carmageddon would work better? :)
[03:32] <lewyjh> gumby: i just thought of it...haha but when i press it nothing happens...:-(
[03:32] <Rainarrow> So I don't have to unmount before unplugging usb disks
[03:32] <Toma-> Randakar: would vmware or qemu work better you think?
[03:32] <Rainarrow> Sometimes that can be bothering
[03:32] <Randakar> Toma-: doubt it. I play pretty old (OLD) games on it, and they run, but not fast ;-)
[03:32] <Gumby> lewyjh: you may have to press it a few times or even hold it for a second or two
[03:32] <blaa> nolimitsoya: ok you are here :)
[03:32] <soundray> Rainarrow: you have to use the sync option to mount
[03:33] <vittorio> soundray, i mean nonblocking. the device returns (with error) when its not ready (like buffer is full)
[03:33] <Randakar> Rainarrow: they just added a feature for that to the 2.6.19 kernel
[03:33] <Randakar> Rainarrow: unfortunately that kernel has not landed in 6.10
[03:33] <Rainarrow> soundray, so it's also possible to add that option into the fstab?
[03:33] <lewyjh> gumby, would that be why my network card isn't working? or at least a sign of why its not working?
[03:33] <soundray> Rainarrow: yes
[03:33] <Rainarrow> Randakar, so I would have to compile a kernel if I want that feature?
[03:33] <Gumby> lewyjh: yes indeed.  the light probably needs to be on which I believe means that the radio is functional
[03:33] <soundray> Rainarrow: I think it will still complain...
[03:34] <Vlet> Last night I installed Dapper on my laptop which has an Nvidia GF4, let all the updates run, then upgraded to Edgy, and when I restarted, X was broke. Is this a common issue with a boilerplate fix?
[03:34] <Randakar> http://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges
[03:34] <Gumby> lewyjh: what is the output of ndiswrapper -l
[03:34] <Randakar> a "-o flush" mount option aimed at FAT-based hotpluggable media devices (mp3)
[03:34] <lewyjh> gumby, any idea why it won't light up? and how do i find out the output?
[03:34] <logankoester> Anyone know how to sync the system clock from the command line?
[03:34] <soundray> Vlet: I don't think so, but you could try the binary driver from NVidia:
[03:34] <soundray> !nvidia | Vlet
[03:34] <ubotu> Vlet: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:34] <Gumby> and also dmesg |grep ndiswrapper  <--  paste this to a pastebin  http://rafb.net/paste
[03:35] <Rainarrow> soundray, I googled a little, seems if you mount a flashdisk w/sync option, it will become extreme slow
[03:35] <Rainarrow> is that true with Ubuntu?
[03:35] <Rainarrow> I am using dapper
[03:35] <Vlet> Thanks soundray
[03:35] <soundray> Rainarrow: I haven't tried
[03:35] <Randakar> Vlet: Is X broke, or is there some other problem? What output is in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> blaa, did you want something?
[03:35] <soundray> Rainarrow: but it's plausible
[03:35] <soundray> logankoester: /etc/network/if-up.d/ntpdate
[03:35] <Randakar> Vlet: and don't paste that in here, just look at it to see if there are any error messages
[03:36] <logankoester> soundray: thanks :)
[03:36] <Randakar> logankoester: run 'ntpdate'
[03:36] <lewyjh> gumby...how does this work?
[03:36] <Rainarrow> Well
[03:36] <blaa> nolimitsoya: I want to know how to use jbod.
[03:36] <Vlet> Randakar: the lappie is at home at the moment... I'm sure I could eventually diagnose the problem.. I just thought I'd see if it was a common enough problem to have a common answer... as it was :)
[03:36] <nolimitsoya> !lvm | blaa
[03:36] <ubotu> blaa: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[03:36] <nolimitsoya> :)
[03:36] <logankoester> hmm, it didn't change the date - maybe I'm using the wrong timezone? How can I set that?
[03:36] <Randakar> Vlet: ah, ok
[03:37] <Toma-> !vmware
[03:37] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player"). Instructions for VMWare Server can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[03:37] <soundray> logankoester: sudo tzconfig
[03:37] <Rainarrow> soundray, so I wonder how Windows treats usb flashdisks? Windows doesn't seem to have this problem
[03:37] <blaa> nolimitsoya: ok
[03:37] <logankoester> soundray: awesome, thanks again
[03:37] <lewyjh> paste "and also dmesg |grep ndiswrapper" into that website?
[03:37] <Gumby> goto the page choose plain text as the language, input your name and a description, paste the output, click paste, the page will refresh and then you paste the new URL to the channel
[03:37] <Rainarrow> soundray, writing is fast and I could unplug w/o umounting
[03:37] <nolimitsoya> blaa, are you sure you want to? raid0 would offer only benefits over jbod, uless you want to expand later, and have a backup
[03:37] <soundray> Rainarrow: it does -- Windows just uses filesystem caches less aggressively, I think
[03:37] <Randakar> Rainarrow: Windows probably handles disk caching in a completely different manner
[03:37] <logankoester> soundray: My timezone is correct, but the clock is still wrong - any idea why?
[03:38] <lewyjh> any description?
[03:38] <Gumby> lewyjh: no, dmesg |grep ndiswrapper is the command, you type that into a console on your desktop and then you paste the output to the pastebin
[03:38] <Rainarrow> logankoester, just set your clock again
[03:38] <logankoester> maybe it didn't have any servers configured to sync to or something?
[03:38] <soundray> logankoester: check what ntp servers you have configured (in /etc/default/ntpdate) and see if you can ping it/them.
[03:38] <logankoester> ahh, forgot to run ntupdate with sudo. Got it now :)
[03:39] <lordmetroid_> how do I search text file for a word?
[03:39] <blaa> nolimitsoya: really ? I don't know becuase this my first time to install ubuntu on two harddisks
[03:39] <lordmetroid_> *text files
[03:39] <soundray> logankoester: the if-up script runs here without sudo
[03:39] <Randakar> logankoester: it's ntpdate, not 'ntpupdate'
[03:39] <lewyjh> gumby, when i type that into konsol...nothing happens.
[03:39] <Gumby> lordmetroid_: use grep in a console.... ie:  grep what_you_want_to_find filename.txt
[03:39] <logankoester> I mean that ;)
[03:39] <amortvigil> hey i tryed to install samab but it gives errors and i cant remove it :O
[03:39] <nolimitsoya> blaa, this isnt ubuntu specific. that why i told you to read up on raid techniques. they all offer different advantages, and disadvantages at that :)
[03:39] <Gumby> lewyjh: then it seems like you dont have ndiswrapper working :)
[03:39] <mordof> hey all.. i was wondering if i could get a link for a walkthrough or somethin, or even a bit of help to get this "screen" thing working? i've heard about it.. being able to attatch and detatch, but i don't know where to start
[03:39] <lordmetroid_> Gumby: thank you
[03:39] <soundray> lordmetroid_: with grep
[03:40] <lewyjh> gumby: NICE!!!
[03:40] <jrib> !screen | mordof
[03:40] <ubotu> mordof: screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[03:40] <amortvigil> the error it gives is E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[03:40] <soundray> oops, late
[03:40] <Gumby> lewyjh: what is the output of lsmod |grep ndis
[03:40] <lewyjh> gumby: i was being sarcastic...so should i do a apt-get install ndiswrapper?
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> blaa, raid is not somthing that you set up in a heartbeat. it requires some planning, and thinking. otherwise youll just end up redoing it
[03:40] <Randakar> amortvigil: that's not very informative
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> blaa, when youve decided what raid level you want perhaps this will help you set it up: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LVMOnRaid
[03:40] <jrib> mordof: try just running 'screen', ctrl-a d  will detach.  'screen -r' will reattach.  That is the basics.  You should read those links and 'man screen' possibly for more stuff
[03:40] <soundray> amortvigil: run 'sudo apt-get -f install' and paste the errors on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org , then give us the URL
[03:40] <mordof> jrib: ty
[03:41] <Randakar> amortvigil: most likely some other component depends on samba, and dpkg won't remove samba unless you also remove that component
[03:41] <lewyjh> gumby, aboslutly nothing...oh boy.
[03:41] <blaa> nolimitsoya: thanks :D
[03:41] <Rainarrow> Oh, and what is the Enterprise Volume Manager thingy?
[03:42] <Gumby> lewyjh: ok, how about this...  dpkg -l ndisw*
[03:42] <FreeNet> hi guys may i know how do we protect ubuntu from virus? how does the virus spread? usually in what form(*example .exe in window)?
[03:42] <mordof> jrib: alright somehow i managed to lose my terminal but keep my screen attatched, lol
[03:42] <FreeNet> !virus
[03:42] <ubotu> A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[03:42] <Randakar> FreeNet: You don't, and it doesn't.
[03:42] <soundray> FreeNet: there are no Linux viruses in the wild.
[03:42] <jrib> mordof: eh?  what did you do?
[03:42] <Gumby> freebse3: linux doesnt really have the need for virus protection
[03:42] <lewyjh> gumby, i got something now.
[03:42] <mordof> jrib: so now i can't get it back :P (i typed screen and then tried to detatch and reattatch)
[03:43] <mordof> but i must've did it wrong
[03:46] (Yul/#ubuntu) hello
[03:46] (Yul/#ubuntu) What is GPG Error?
[03:56] (Polysics/#ubuntu) wheels3572, apt-get update
[03:56] (Randakar/#ubuntu) svip: A simple google query helps
[03:56] (lewyjh/#ubuntu) gumby, oh boy, this could get complicated...
[03:56] <Cid> hello everyone
[03:56] (soundray/#ubuntu) amortvigil: what happens when you 'sudo kill -9 10427'?
[03:56] (Randakar/#ubuntu) http://www.google.com/search?q=bdf+fonts+on+linux
[03:57] (wheels3572/#ubuntu) Polysics, ok ty Im thinking that will stop my software updates issue Im having
[03:57] (FreeNet/#ubuntu) Dan Brown's Digital Fortress, the powerful decryption machine. Is it true?
[03:57] (blaa/#ubuntu) nolimitsoya: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileServerOnLVMOnRAID1#head-c0f891d8f8a3f08d3031b2ce2fb376b481060777
[03:57] (Randakar/#ubuntu) svip: login, logout should work
[03:57] <nolimitsoya> blaa, what about it?
[03:57] <blaa> nolimitsoya: ok this is my answer  thanks lot
[03:57] <blaa> nolimitsoya: helpful for me so much
[03:58] <Cid> hey, I'm having the problem that some tray icons (like Kopete or Azureus) are hardly shown in the gnome-panel (only a 1 pixel wide stripe). Anyone heard of that problem before?
[03:58] <amortvigil> soundray nothing happens
[03:58] <Gumby> lewyjh: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Edgy  follow this guide
[03:58] <ubuntu> sw
[03:58] <Gumby> lewyjh: asuming you use edgy of course :)
[03:58] <soundray> amortvigil: now try 'sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart' again
[03:58] <nolimitsoya> blaa, if you use raid level 1, youll only be able to access 50% of your storage space :)
[03:58] <wheels3572> Ok where the location of the update files so I can go and edit out an entry
[03:58] <nolimitsoya> blaa, the other half will be used for redundancy
[03:59] <FreeNet> lol got so excited over virus... I finally found myself something that can keep me busy for next few years
[03:59] <Gumby> nolimitsoya: but if redundancy is important for you then its well worth the loss
[03:59] <Polysics> back :-) this chatzilla thing is nifty
[03:59] <wheels3572> wb Polysics
[03:59] <blaa> nolimitsoya: ok I will use raid 0
[03:59] <amortvigil> soudnray it works!
[03:59] <Randakar> FreeNet: Digital fortress is fiction. So is it true? well, it's fiction ..
[03:59] <nolimitsoya> blaa, if you want redundancy, id suggest raid level5 unless thatll give you performance problems
[03:59] <Cid> exit
[03:59] <soundray> amortvigil: it's still marked for removal now.
[03:59] <Polysics> what is Digital Fortress? sounds interesting if it's a book/movie
[03:59] <nolimitsoya> Gumby, i think level 5 would be more apropirate (and cheaper) in most cases
[03:59] <sir-k-> which version of libgpod do I need to use with amarok 1.4.4 provided by kubuntu?
[03:59] <wheels3572> Polysics, is the list located so I can go and update it and remove an entry please?
[03:59] <wheels3572> and ty
[04:00] <blaa> nolimitsoya: no I just want to merge two harddisks
[04:00] <FreeNet> putting 5000 Processors together and run decryption... I don't think it's impossible.
[04:00] <soundray> amortvigil: probably best to finish off the job by doing the purge again, and then reinstall, or not, as you prefer.
[04:00] <Randakar> Polysics: Possibly a terribly misguided one though ;-)
[04:00] <Gumby> nolimitsoya: well, I didnt hear the whole conversation... but I dont see hwo raid 5 would be cheaper
[04:00] <nolimitsoya> Gumby, you "loose" less space
[04:01] <Polysics> wheels3572: i would be glad to help, but i don't know enough about debian to avoid breaking your installation :-)
[04:01] <FreeNet> Human can go to the moon... what else can't happen on earth?
[04:01] <Randakar> FreeNet: 5000 processors is nothing. For some algorithms and some keys the current known shortest time to break it requires several million years and all the molecules in the universe to be one big processor
[04:01] <FreeNet> maybe Death..
[04:01] <Polysics> Randakar: then is it a book? fiction or essay?
[04:01] <soundray> FreeNet: this is a support channel. Please join #ubuntu-offtopic for any non-support related conversations.
[04:01] <Randakar> FreeNet: No idea, FreeNet was mentioning it
[04:01] <FreeNet> lol sorry
[04:01] <Polysics> can you tell i'm out of books to read? .-)
[04:02] <soundray> amortvigil: am I making sense?
[04:02] <Randakar> FreeNet: However, quantum computing promises computers that can break the current state of the art encryption - but it's still just a promise, and there are known mathematical constructs that cannot be broken that way.
[04:02] <Polysics> ok, back *hopefully* on linux
[04:03] <boink> this channel is for support ...
[04:03] <boink> heh, ubuntu needs massive amounts of support!
[04:03] <Randakar> boink: good point :-)
[04:04] <amortvigil> soundray no because the removal gives still the error:P
[04:04] <soundray> amortvigil: did you sudo it?
[04:04] <boink> feisty? oooh, that must be painful
[04:04] <wheels3572> Can ANYONE tell me where I can go to edit the repo list please?
[04:05] <Randakar> boink: Not really, upgrade worked fine
[04:05] <soundray> Randakar: please join #ubuntu+1 to discuss feisty problems
[04:05] <Gumby> wheels3572: /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:05] <Randakar> boink: No real trouble until I rebooted it (auch)
[04:05] <wheels3572> ty Gumby
[04:05] <Randakar> soundray: I tried, kinda quiet in there. No answer even ;-)
[04:05] <wheels3572> Gumby, what's the processname for the software Updates do you know.  I need to kill it
[04:05] <amortvigil> soundray yes i did
[04:05] <wheels3572> it wont stop running
[04:05] <Randakar> boink: I worked around the biggest issue though, now I just want the loose ends fixed :-)
[04:06] <soundray> Randakar: check back in five hours, that's usually a busier time
[04:06] <Randakar> soundray: Hm, I should be home by then ;-)
[04:06] <fwtest> hello, if i want to run lamp and ssh, is it a bad idea to use that box as a firewall too?
[04:06] <Gumby> wheels3572: in a console run ps aux and have a look
[04:06] <RedKrieg|Work> does anyone have the tarball for the flash 9 beta that they can email me?  I can't download it from adobe's site (error 500)
[04:06] <wheels3572> ok ty
[04:06] <soundray> amortvigil: okay, we need a more structured approach.
[04:06] <Gumby> wheels3572: its generally not advised to kill an update process though
[04:07] <Randakar> fwtest: That's what I do. Not neccesarily the best of ideas, but it works.
[04:07] <wheels3572> well it's done the update
[04:07] <wheels3572> and everything
[04:07] <wheels3572> when it refreshes
[04:07] <wheels3572> it's just spinning
[04:07] <FreeNet> ok i am having trouble installing freenx... pls view http://pastecode.net/?action=viewpost&tag=1153 . it's an error msg from synaptic
[04:07] <fwtest> Randakar, what could be a problem if i do this on same box?
[04:07] <wheels3572> wont move
[04:08] <Randakar> fwtest: well, if somebody hacks your webserver, they can listen in on your desktop internet traffic
[04:08] <FreeNet> can dapper's package be installed on edgy?
[04:08] <Randakar> fwtest: for instance. And since they control your firewall, they might turn the firewall off causing you no end of grief
[04:08] <wheels3572> gonna have to reboot grrrrrrrrrrr it wont kill synap either
[04:08] <Randakar> fwtest: but then I've never had that kind of problem
[04:08] <soundray> amortvigil: what do you want to do with samba in the end? Do you want it installed or purged?
[04:09] <amortvigil> installed
[04:09] <Gumby> wheels3572: try kill -13 PID#
[04:09] <fwtest> Randakar, but if the firewall is also hacked, then the traffic can also be listended
[04:09] <Randakar> FreeNet: Possibly, but it's not recommended and it might not work.
[04:09] <sod75> FreeNet: some simple package will probably work, but more complex stuff will quickly end up in dependency hell
[04:09] <BadLoop> hi
[04:09] <wheels3572> Gumby, operation not permitted
[04:09] <soundray> amortvigil: I suggest you run 'sudo apt-get install samba' now and reboot.
[04:09] <wheels3572> do I need Sudo?
[04:10] <Gumby> wheels3572: oops,. yes sudo
[04:10] <wheels3572> thought so ty
[04:10] <Randakar> fwtest: if you have a dedicated firewall chances of people hacking it are just lower than when you put a webserver on it. An order of magnitude lower if you secure it properly
[04:10] <BadLoop> im sorry im asking this question, but my inet connection doesnt allow me to browse te web at the moment .. i wanted to add dns to /etc/resolv.conf but theres only a weird directory .. can you tell me which file im looking for please ?
[04:10] <amortvigil> i have got it working ^^
[04:11] <amortvigil> thanx all
[04:11] <Gumby> BadLoop: /etc/reslolv.conf should be a file not a directory
[04:11] <Randakar> BadLoop: resolv.conf is the file you're looking for
[04:11] <wheels3572> killed the wrong process oh well lol wont hurt it
[04:11] <wheels3572> ty Gumby
[04:11] <wheels3572> got it
[04:11] <Gumby> wheels3572: excellent
[04:12] <fwtest> Randakar, if i have a firewall which protects a webserver behind it, it is also still possible for someone to hack the webserver?
[04:12] <Randakar> fwtest: Yes.
[04:12] <BadLoop> Gumby, i see theres resolvconf/
[04:12] <w3ccv> are there any good lighweight firewalols for Edgy?
[04:12] <Gumby> BadLoop: what is the output of ls -l /etc/resolv*
[04:12] <Randakar> fwtest: depends on what you run on the webserver, but the biggest hole would be something like PHPBB running on apache
[04:13] <fwtest> Randakar, so it is just the same using firewall or not?
[04:13] <Randakar> fwtest: the difference is that once somebody hacks your webserver the impact of that is lessened because they won't immediately also control your firewall ;-)
[04:13] <jrib> !firewall | w3ccv
[04:13] <ubotu> w3ccv: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:14] <Randakar> fwtest: partitioning stuff off like that is a core principle of good security
[04:14] <fwtest> Randakar, anyway, do you think a firewall is there to protect servers or lan inside?
[04:14] <BadLoop> Gumby, i probably got it .. seems i have some problems with new ip from my provider ... thanks.
[04:14] <Randakar> fwtest: both.
[04:14] <tristan_> just dropped by to tell you guys that ubuntu rocks :)
[04:15] <Randakar> tristan_: preaching to the choir here :-)
[04:15] <tristan_> haha, gnome rocks with ubuntu !
[04:15] <soundray> tristan_: I fully agree with you
[04:15] <fwtest> Randakar, but how can a firewall protect servers since people can connect directly to it?
[04:16] <Randakar> fwtest: a firewall protects the server if it exposes more services than just port 80 HTTP.
[04:16] <FreeNet> i see.. ok i'll take a look again.

[04:16] <macluvjay> using 6.10 server edition, how can I kill X so that I can start a window nanager from a console?
[04:16] <wheels3572> Gumby, Where is the sources.list again under /etc what?
[04:17] <soundray> macluvjay: if you have gdm installed, 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'
[04:17] <LjL> wheels3572: /etc/apt
[04:17] <Randakar> fwtest: furthermore it gives you a tool to take control back if something happens. If the server = the firewall you can't shut it down remotely (no control) but if the firewall is seperate you can just cut all links to it if it is compromised

=== Griverr is now known as Griver
[04:18] <Randakar> fwtest: however all that is pretty much theoretical, if you think it's more convenient to put both on the same box .. *shrug*. It's what I did ;-)
[04:18] <soundray> macluvjay: alternatively, switch to console with 'Ctrl-Alt-F1', log in and run 'sudo killall X'
[04:19] <timo90> Hey my ubuntu sems to take forever at the boot
[04:19] <Randakar> macluvjay: if you want to be thorough, 'sudo aptitude install slay; slay <user>' works too ;-)
[04:19] <timo90> slash and its really slow
[04:19] <fwtest> Randakar, i would love to do it, since i just want to do it privately and i dont have many boxes, but 1 more question, wont it slower my box if i use the firewall on a same box? if a DOS attack coming, then i am dead
[04:19] <timo90> i have barl installed but its working ok
[04:19] <soundray> timo90: do you know at what stage it spends its time?
[04:20] <Ramsie> I am a linux newbie, I just installed ubuntu yesterday, and with some liberal doses of help from a friend, got nvidia drivers installed, saw the nvidia logo, and then was successful in running things like Enlightenment and xmms with Milkdrop, so it seemed to be working.   Today, it's telling me the nvidia GPU is no longer recognized, so I went in the xorg.conf file like I was told to...
[04:20] <Randakar> fwtest: frankly DOS attacks are not easy to protect against; Unless you're a big company with resources or are using a hosting provider with cluefull admins don't expect you can defend against that at all
[04:20] <Ramsie> now, why is the nvidia driver not working, and how do I make it work again?
[04:21] <Randakar> Ramsie: did you update anything in the meanwhile?
[04:21] <soundray> Ramsie: can you find a line that says either 'Driver "nv"' or 'Driver "nvidia"'?
[04:21] <Ramsie> I was told to... and changed the "nvidia" entry to just "nv", at which point I got the KDE desktop to come back up.
[04:21] <wheels3572> god Gumby how do I exit vim
[04:21] <Ramsie> I did that
[04:22] <tabman> this website http://voicecafe.optecs.net/alquranchat/voice.asp is suppose to install a plugin, it works on Windows but no here on Ubuntu, probably some firefox extension missing
[04:22] <wheels3572> i need to close vim without savin
[04:22] <Randakar> wheels3572:  :q!
[04:22] <fwtest> Randakar, i see, i just wonder if iptables will use up some ram dropping malicious packets
[04:22] <Gumby> wheels3572: :q!
[04:22] <scythe128> anyone know which rc script I will need to modify in order to run something at startup after gnome or kde has loaded?
[04:22] <Gumby> wheels3572: if you want something much easier to learn try nano :)
[04:23] <Randakar> fwtest: possibly yes, but the kernel tries hard to defend against that
[04:23] <soundray> scythe128: none. Go through System-Preferences-Session
[04:23] <dreamer> hmm, I can't connect with vnc to my desktop, when I'm sure I have vnc enabled, where can I check this and how do I enable vnc-access over ssh ?
[04:23] <Ramsie> any suggestions?
[04:23] <Randakar> scythe128: there's a menu entry in the gnome menu for that
[04:23] <Randakar> scythe128: look under 'sessions'
[04:23] <fwtest> Randakar, thanks for your time, i know what to do now
[04:23] <Ramsie> I didn't change the "nv" until after the GPU was no longer being recognized, I had to do it from the command line
[04:23] <scythe128> soundray, I am in kde most of the time.  I want it to run no matter what wm I am using
[04:23] <Gumby> dreamer: the server running vnc server probably isnt using vnc over ssh.
[04:24] <Randakar> fwtest: You're welcome :-)
[04:24] <Gumby> dreamer: from the client box try and telnet to the server box on port 5900
[04:24] <soundray> scythe128: I'm sure KDE has a similar mechanism for running programs at login
[04:24] <dreamer> Gumby: I just meant that I can access the pc over ssh, but I can't connect with VNCviewer
[04:24] <kr0n1x> exit
[04:24] <Gumby> dreamer: ie:  telnet 192.168.1.100 5900
[04:24] <Skrot-> scythe128: Put stuff in .kde/Autostart to have it autostart on login
[04:24] <Gumby> if you get a RFB connectiong then vnc is running
[04:25] <Gumby> if you dont then its either blocked or not running
[04:25] <Skrot-> ~/.kde/Autostart
[04:25] <wheels3572> Yeah im not getting no where im just screwing up my sources.list even more GRRRRRRRR
[04:25] <dreamer> Gumby: can I do this in pyttu also (/me on a windows machine atm)
[04:25] <dreamer> putty*
[04:25] <Gumby> dreamer: you can do it from a windows console also
[04:26] <ismail> hi all
[04:26] <Randakar> wheels3572: when in doubt, log in on a different console and just 'killall -9 vi' ;-)
[04:26] <dreamer> Gumby: nothing really happens ...
[04:26] <wheels3572> ty Randakar
[04:26] <Gumby> dreamer: define "nothing"
[04:27] <ismail> how do i install .bin in ubuntu
[04:27] <Randakar> wheels3572: vi can be very frustrating to the uninitiated
[04:27] <dreamer> er ..
[04:27] <soundray> ismail: you don't, if you can somehow avoid it.
[04:27] <soundray> ismail: what do you want to install?

[04:27] <Randakar> well, I'm off. Good luck all
[04:27] <dreamer> I've tried it with putty, and over ssh from this machine
[04:27] <Gumby> ismail: chmod +x filename.bin and then ./filename.bin (unless you need to install it with root privs then sudo ./filename.bin)
[04:28] <wheels3572> it is and I just opened up the file again
[04:28] <Gumby> dreamer: ok, then either a firewall is blocking it or vnc isnt running
[04:28] <soundray> ismail: before you follow Gumby, let me check something...
[04:28] <Gumby> dreamer: how did you start the vnc server?
[04:28] <dreamer> ok, how can I start/enable nvc ?
[04:28] <ismail> oki
[04:28] <ismail> go ahead
[04:29] <dreamer> Gumby: I think I enabled vnc access a while ago on my desktop, from the menu, but .. that was in gnome, I have kde running atm, so could it be it isn't enabled in kde yet ?
[04:29] <ismail> i was ablw to install it in suse.. just by running it in the consol
[04:29] <ismail> why cant i in ubuntu

[04:31] <dreamer> ok, can I activate vnc over ssh ?

I have followed the online-guides and created the correct .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/. But when  I log in, i get a message on /usr/bin/startfluxbox-line 27 - an access denied error.
[04:43] <Z3dzDead> is this a fluxbox issue?
[04:43] <Z3dzDead> i don't know why- but the permissions are set to my user
[04:43] <jrib> Z3dzDead: why not use the ubuntu fulxbox package?  It sets that up for you
[04:44] <Z3dzDead> oh? well, i must've been mistaken than- i am using the .deb package from the repo.
[04:44] <slavik> how do I get perl support working with apache2? (what packages do I need?)
[04:45] <jrib> Z3dzDead: you shouldn't have had to create the .desktop.  Pastebin 'cat /usr/bin/startfluxbox && apt-cache policy fluxbox && dpkg -S /usr/bin/startfluxbox' please

[05:01] <apokryphos> Adium: are you installing skype from......
[05:01] <apokryphos> !skype
[05:01] <ubotu> To install Skype on Ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype  -  To record on Skype, check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto
[05:01] <Adium> apokryphos, from apt-get install
[05:01] <pty> x-r00t-x: set it to ALSA and click 'test'
[05:01] <thyrfingo> its not there
[05:01] <x-r00t-x> pty, ok
[05:01] <apokryphos> Adium: which repository
[05:02] <x-r00t-x> pty, same sound
[05:02] <Adium> the plf i think it is
[05:02] <Adium> hang on
[05:02] <apokryphos> !plf
[05:02] <ubotu> PLF is the Penguin Liberation Front. For more info see: http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf. PLF is down indefinitely pending a new maintainer; see http://plf.zarb.org/. see also !seveas
[05:02] <jrib> thyrfingo: ok, start a terminal.  What does this say:  apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop | grep -i Installed
[05:02] <Gumby> scythe128: you can start a program with an & at the end and then exit the window by typing exit
[05:02] <apokryphos> Adium: basically, you don't want to be using plf.
[05:02] <pty> x-r00t-x: try with ESD
[05:02] <Gumby> scythe128: not sure if this is what you want/need etc
[05:02] <x-r00t-x> pty, same
[05:02] <scythe128> gumby  Ill check and find out
[05:02] <Adium> so how do i install skype?
[05:02] <jrib> !skype | Adium
[05:02] <thyrfingo> how to start a terminal

[05:03] <x-r00t-x> pty, is the any driver for 945gnt on board sound card?
[05:03] <jrib> thyrfingo: applications > accessories > terminal
[05:03] <slicky> hi..  "Edgy Eft already ships with AiGLX so you don't need to install AiGLX."  how do i know if iv really got this installed?
[05:03] <Adium> ok
[05:03] <chaddy> scythe128: screen is worth investigating if you want to detach from terminals...
[05:03] <thyrfingo> im there now
[05:03] <pty> x-r00t-x: i dunno - if you didn't change anything and it used to work I don't see why its a driver issue
[05:04] <apokryphos> slicky: ......if you've got edgy, then you've got aiglx. Clear, right?
[05:04] <scythe128> gumby.. no go, jackd outputs to terminal... it never "completes"
[05:04] <slicky> apokryphos, ok
[05:04] <scythe128> !screen
[05:04] <ubotu> screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[05:04] <thyrfingo> jrib its not saying apt-cache policy ubuntu-dektop
[05:05] <Gumby> scythe128: if you press enter you should get a prompt back, you should also be able to redirect the output to file or to /dev/null
[05:05] <JuJuBee> How do I make sure that hxplay is in my PATH?
[05:05] <jrib> thyrfingo: ok, start a terminal.  What does this say:  apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop | grep -i Installed
[05:05] <jrib> thyrfingo: you made a typo
[05:06] <thyrfingo> wait i want to try something my self, i think i can fix it myself, :D
[05:06] <Adium> thanks guys :)
[05:07] <jamesbrose> Whats the best media player out there?
[05:07] <jamesbrose> Audio Player*
[05:07] <chaddy> I like VLC, jamesbrose
[05:07] <Gumby> depends on what you want.  I like amarok for managing my music.  but its overkill if you just want to load a few songs or playlist or cd
[05:07] <frogzoo> JuJuBee: 'which hxplay'
[05:07] <thyrfingo> i forgot to upgrade to the newst ubuntu
[05:07] <z694034> VLC isn't the best for audio
[05:08] <jamesbrose> I need something like so you can order the artists like in rythembox
[05:08] <fdoving> jamesbrose: i use amarok, i like mpd, i sometimes use beep-media-player (winamp 2.x like)..
[05:08] <Gumby> jamesbrose: try amarok
[05:08] <jamesbrose> Ive tryed it
[05:08] <jamesbrose> I also like something fast
[05:08] <Gumby> IMHO its the best out there for organization.
[05:08] <jamesbrose> using Amarok, i didnt find it was too fast.
[05:08] <fdoving> jamesbrose: did you try beep-media-player?
[05:08] <chaddy> for just an audio player I use music123
[05:08] <jamesbrose> Yeah, but that hasn't got the thing like rythembox
[05:09] <chaddy> ;-)
[05:09] <JuJuBee> frogzoo : I installed the real player and when I try to open a website that streams video, I get a message telling me it cannot find hsplay or realplay in the path.
[05:09] <ana__> hi folks, i am having problems with no sound on my system even tho alsa drivers are installed

[05:09] <jamesbrose> any more?

[05:31] <skeetbadger> hi, i just bought an eizo flexscan s2110w widescreen lcd. the problem is ubuntu dosent recognize it properly and gives it a resolution of 1280x1024, while it should be 1680x1050. ive run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and also booted the live cd to see if there was any change, but its still running at 1280x1024.xorg also sees it as 'default monitor' iirc. ive added 1680x1050 to xorg manually so all is well, but my question is is there anyt
[05:31] <skeetbadger> hing else i need to do ? and is there something else i should do to ensure this monitor becomes fully detected in feisty?
[05:31] <x-r00t-x> pty, i set it to low but its seem still bad :-S
[05:32] <Gumby> drkm: 95+% of things you can do in windows can be done just as easy in most linux distros including ubuntu
[05:32] <Gumby> drkm: the other 5% can usually be done with minimal effort
[05:32] <blazemonger> only thing in linux id like to get working is Rosegarden
[05:32] <blazemonger> !Rosegarden
[05:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Rosegarden - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[05:34] <Gumby> drkm: well, some hardware doesnt work.  most does, but there are some companies out there that refuse to offer decent drivers for their hardware.  Most games wont work especially if they are older.
[05:34] <KillerT> enry why not compiz
[05:34] <enry183> i dont know
[05:34] <chaks> hi everybody
[05:34] <chaks> do anybody know how to get Ubuntu Installer source code?
[05:34] <KillerT> it is said to be better
[05:34] <Gumby> drkm: your best bet is to just install it and see if it works for you.  Or, just run it from the livecd for a bit
[05:34] <enry183> my video card is ntel 855GM(E)
[05:34] <DeamonminD> i installed ubutu 6.10 how to verify my modem :? i cant connect to internet.. i was using dapper drake it was goin good! can someone help me out?

[05:35] <enry183> acceleration 3d

[05:37] <pty> x-r00t-x: ah.  you mean when beryl is on the sound quality is bad?
[05:37] <Gumby> DeamonminD: depends on a lot of things really.  you have to figure out why its not connecting.  is the proper driver module loading, is it a setup issue etc etc
[05:38] <Milchmann> good evening ;) is there a way to prevent a non-admin user from shutting down the system while there are other useres logged on?

[05:42] <x-r00t-x> can anyone tell me when i use apt-get install something . where is it download .deb file ?
[05:42] <Lukian> don't edit your kernel or root path, just change suffixes to "ro nosplash"
[05:42] <fraki> aren't ubuntu going to introduce proprietary drivers in the next release, 7.04
[05:42] <Gumby> x-r00t-x: /var/cache/apt/archives
[05:43] <x-r00t-x> tnx :D
[05:43] <fraki> shouldn't that solve the driver problems for graphic cards
[05:43] <higi_> hi
[05:43] <fraki> enabiling better hardware rendering support
[05:43] <KillerT> is there a way to load xgl on display:0.0 and display:0.1
[05:43] <VigoFusion> Gazo: There is also a Debian DB where you can look up what is supported
[05:43] <yuesefa> is there any easy way to setup a postfix mail server in just few steps?
[05:43] <higi_> I can listen to music but neither GAIM nor aMSN can reproduce sounds!!! anyone knows why?
[05:43] <Gumby> KillerT: you are probably better off asking that in #ubuntu-xgl
[05:44] <KillerT> yuesefa that is probably something that can be found on google
[05:44] <KillerT> thanks gumby
[05:44] <higi_> I can listen to music but neither GAIM nor aMSN can reproduce sounds!!! anyone knows why?
[05:44] <james_> Hello. I was wondering if anyone know about Gaim2.0beta3.1
[05:44] <higi_> dopes anyone have an idea
[05:44] <james_> knows anything about it
[05:44] <VigoFusion> http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/wiki/ Lists some supported stuff for Debian
[05:44] <Gazo> Hehe , unfortunately I just switched to ubuntu .. I had the laptop before I made the switch ... I didn't realise that this card had such crappy support in ubuntu ..
[05:44] <james_> few questions
[05:45] <KillerT> Gazo u know what is worse
[05:45] <Gazo> that this bug has been around for over a year .. and they still haven't fixed the drivers ?
[05:46] <KillerT> It is rumoured all over the internet people get ati cards that work with linux but i had two that i could not get to work with opengl
[05:46] <VigoFusion> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI That is the official on how to
[05:46] <fraki> i got ati x700 and it worked with ubuntu out of the box
[05:46] <Z3dzDead> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35443/ there we are
[05:46] <KillerT> i had an all in wonder 9800xt and a 9600
[05:46] <fraki> i use the link vigofusion gave you to try and improve performance and got better performance
[05:47] <higi_> I can listen to music but neither GAIM nor aMSN can reproduce sounds!!! anyone knows why?
[05:47] <higi_> for example when recieving a message
[05:47] <Gazo> Well on another note if I can't run opengl .. Does anyone know if you can run seperate resolutions with two monitors and Bigdesktop ?
[05:47] <KillerT> yeah i did that with my 9800xt
[05:48] <Gazo> any ideas how ? I tried passing "mode2" .. and it didn't work ..
[05:48] <burepe> Can someone explain to me or point me to a faq on how to make my url point to my server?
[05:48] <x-r00t-x> how do i make .tar file from terminal ???
[05:48] <BadLoop> man tar
[05:49] <jamesbrose> Does anybody know a good editor like TextMate for ubuntu?
[05:49] <burepe> gedit
[05:49] <VigoFusion> gedit
[05:49] <jamesbrose> apart from geidt
[05:49] <x-r00t-x> bur[n] er_, static ip ?
[05:49] <jamesbrose> lol
[05:49] <fraki> burepe you need a redirection url like dyndns.org or no-ip
[05:49] <jamesbrose> gedit*
[05:49] <KillerT> nedit
[05:49] <KillerT> <gotta be different
[05:49] <VigoFusion> Is also a text doohicky
[05:49] <Gazo> haha
[05:49] <Guychi> Hi. Does the Ubuntu LiveCD allow installing additional FireFox extensions? (at least until reboot)
[05:49] <Z3dzDead> kedit
[05:49] <KillerT> kubuntu
[05:50] <VigoFusion> and nano
[05:50] <jamesbrose> ...
[05:50] <burepe> fraki so I go there and it will be straight forward what to do?
[05:50] <KillerT> nano wins
[05:50] <Gazo> You guys ever use BMP?
[05:50] <KillerT> the image file
[05:50] <KillerT> ?
[05:50] <burepe> Guychi: as far as I know you can't since it is a cd
[05:50] <VigoFusion> Not yet
[05:50] <anders__> im trying to enable sound in enemy territory, using this help page: http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=FAQ023 but as i have kernel > 2.6.17 it says i have to "enable CONFIG_SND_VERBOSE_PROCFS ("Verbose procfs contents") in your kernel config"  how do i do that?
[05:50] <The_Machine> does adept package manager use the same repositories as apt? (maybe a stupid question..)
[05:50] <fraki> burepe you just create an account and say you create a burepe.no-ip.org account and give it your ip address
[05:51] <Guychi> burepe: is there any kind of LiveCD distro that would allow? e.g. by using a ramdisk?
[05:51] <higi_> for example when recieving a message
[05:51] <fraki> the only pitfall is that you need to update the account with every ip change
[05:51] <Gazo> http://bmpx.beep-media-player.org/site/BMPx_Homepage
[05:51] <fraki> if you have a router you need to make sure that the ports that you want the public to use are forewarded appropriately
[05:51] <Gazo> working nicely in ubuntu ...
[05:52] <burepe> Guychi: I don't know. I think it is possible to make your own live cd and add what ever programs you want and then burn it. Of course if you want to add anything you will have to reburn it
[05:53] <higi_> I can listen to music but neither GAIM nor aMSN can reproduce sounds!!! anyone knows why?
[05:53] <St_MPA3b> is it text-processor like word?
[05:53] <emss> where can one download the gnome style used in Ubuntu?
[05:53] <Guychi> burepe: I just need my Firefox profile directory to be writeable. how can I do that? can I create a symlink to a dir on a ramdisk?
[05:54] <VigoFusion> Gazo: Does that thing play WMA or whatever WinMP uses?
[05:54] <x-r00t-x> i cant see video when i am runing beryl. help me with it
[05:54] <fcortes> kisco_el_basilon@hotmail.com

[06:03] <p33k4y> Mando what graphic card do you have ?
[06:03] <VigoFusion> tim90: Most obvious thing would either be the Distro Package is too demanding, or there is too much backround progs in operation.
[06:03] <timo90> Mando: sounds like your have graphic card problems
[06:04] <Mando> no really? lol

[06:09] <timo90> Mando:at the moment i only know that its the live cds fault
[06:09] <Mando> i was just playing need for speed most wanted on windows :) so it works pretty fine

[06:10] <botaina> hey
[06:10] <Barry> When I had Windoze on my IBM ThinkPad 390E, the third (blue) mouse button worked along with the TrackPoint nubby joystick in the keyboard to make documents scroll. This dind't work under Hoary, but I've just upgraded to Edgy and have been so amazed by all the other cool fixes that I though I'd ask about this. IBM's Web site has no (obvious) driver for Linux. How do I get this to work in Edgy?
[06:10] <botaina> hello
[06:10] <higi_> my GAIM sound doesn't work. I do not hav the Automatic option in Preferences/Sound. What's wrong?
[06:11] <timo90> Mando: do you play online

[06:11] <jishin> VigoFusion: I got all the language pkgs related to JPese already
[06:11] <VigoFusion> Barry: Have you tried the Forums and or the fglrx/Xorg?
[06:11] <Mando> oh ok :S
[06:11] <Mando> i have a lightly bigger problem now lol
[06:11] <jishin> I've been able to type in JPese in some apps

[06:12] <Barry> VigoFusion: No, I haven't. I usually have good luck when starting here.... :-) Are you talking about the Ubunto forums? I don't know what fglrx/Xorg is.
[06:12] <timo90> Mando:do you ever get to see the screen when it is loading
[06:12] <VigoFusion> tim90: Yes, many times that is the fix, unfortunately, but that is what Backups are for.
[06:12] <timo90> or is it mashed from the start
[06:12] <jishin> I used to work with tetex and ptex for Jpese document, but couldn't figure it out when come to texlive
[06:13] <timo90> VigoFusion: seems the back ups can be a pian to make
[06:13] <mark__> anybody here who can help me with my cd burning problem?
[06:13] <zspada15> how do i download a package only without installing it?
[06:13] <Mando> yes it loads
[06:13] <Mando> and i hear the sound of startup
[06:13] <timo90> what do you see
[06:13] <Mando> but nothing on the screen
[06:13] <VigoFusion> Barry: This is not the page for your deal, but it is the forums and explains a litte about fglrx, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=273934
[06:14] <Mando> and when i press ctrl+alt+f1/f2 i get nothing
[06:14] <Mando> i get a screen full of mixed colours allover
[06:14] <Rainarrow> Hi there guys, I have something to ask about bash: how could I rename all files under a dir from foo* to bar*?
[06:14] <mark__> Mando: did you try to start the setup in VGA only mode?
[06:14] <timo90> Mando:there must be some kind of graphics that show up with out the screen beeing massed up
[06:14] <Rainarrow> i.e. foo01 become bar01, foo02 become bar02 etc
[06:14] <Barry> VigoFusion: Thanks!

[06:17] <Rainarrow> stoorty, what do you mean? My question is about how to rename a sequence of files
[06:17] <winand> i have no idea what a pipe is
[06:17] <Rainarrow> stoorty, like rename all foo* to bar*
[06:17] <Rainarrow> stoorty, I tried mv foo* bar*, doesn't work
[06:17] <stoorty> sorry
[06:17] <burepe> gimmulf: logmein.com is free and simple

[06:19] <burepe> I bought a domain name and I want to point it to my server but I am a little confused. The site that I bought it at gives me DNS options but I am not sure which one is my situation "f your domain(s) are hosted here, choose 'Default Hosted Nameservers.'
[06:19] <burepe> If your domain(s) are parked here, choose 'Default Parked Nameservers.'
[06:19] <burepe> If your domain(s) are hosted somewhere else, choose 'Custom Nameservers.'
[06:19] <burepe> Default Hosting Nameservers (NS1.SECURESERVER.NET, NS2.SECURESERVER.NET)
[06:19] <burepe> Default Parked Nameservers (PARK19.SECURESERVER.NET, PARK20.SECURESERVER.NET)
[06:19] <burepe> Custom Nameservers" which one should I pick?
[06:19] <coyotex> question, how can i use aptitude to install php mysql support
[06:20] <burepe> sorry that was longer than I thougth
[06:20] <fyrestrtr> burepe: wth this has to do with ubuntu?
[06:20] <fyrestrtr> coyotex: sudo apt-get install php-mysql
[06:20] <burepe> The server that I am trying to set up is ubuntu. That is it.
[06:20] <coyotex> i have already done that but it doesn't works in cli
[06:21] <Dimensions> can i ask an irrelevant question regarding .sql script if it doesn't irritate any one ... i want to create a database and tables in it automatically using a .sql script how do i implement it i dont rem the command for it
[06:21] <fyrestrtr> Dimensions: there is #mysql for MySQL and #sql for general sql questions.
[06:21] <scythe128> fyre.. search for mysql in synaptic.. you should see the package you want there and just click "mark for install" and apply
[06:21] <fyrestrtr> coyotex: make sure you install php-cli
[06:22] <fyrestrtr> scythe128: thanks, but maybe you should tell coyotex
[06:22] <coyotex> sure i did it
[06:22] <Dimensions> fyrestrtr:  no one helpin there  thats why....
[06:22] <coyotex> in fact php5-cli
[06:22] <fyrestrtr> coyotex: define 'doesn't work'
=== Iain is now known as Psychobudgie
[06:22] <fyrestrtr> Dimensions: then perhaps you should ask in #ubuntu-offtopic. This is an official support channel.
[06:22] <fyrestrtr> Dimensions: for ubuntu :)
[06:23] <Dimensions> thanks dude didn't know abt that channel ...
[06:23] <coyotex> php5-cli works but it doesn;t support mysql library so i am trying to use aptitude to make them work together
[06:24] <VigoFusion> Doit,,,I new I was forgetting something, Thank you fyrestrtr
[06:24] <fyrestrtr> coyotex: how do you know it doesn't support mysql?
[06:25] <coyotex> Fatal error: Call to undefined function mysql_connect()
[06:25] <winand> fyrestrtr: I guess what I really want to do is activate an app if the pid is already in use, so no duplicate instances open... but do I need pipes dto do this?
[06:25] <serkan`c> hello

[06:26] <serkan`c> s/taht/that
[06:26] <fyrestrtr> winand: no, just check if the app is already running via a lockfile or somesuch. Or if you already know the pid file, just check for the process status and you will know if its still running or not.

[06:28] <DAZE-AdaR> hey... ive never used linux before and im trying to install ubuntu on my laptop
[06:28] <DAZE-AdaR> when I boot from the CD and select "start/install",
[06:28] <DAZE-AdaR> I get a "kernel panic" error
[06:29] <p33k4y> are the install an live cd the same ?
[06:29] <coyotex> yes i did any better suggestion
[06:29] <Stormx2> DAZE-AdaR: Did you try again?
[06:29] <DAZE-AdaR> many times
[06:29] <nolimitsoya> p33k4y, yes
[06:29] <w3ccv> DAZE-AdaR, is is a good CD burn
[06:29] <Stormx2> DAZE-AdaR: It could be a bad burn
[06:29] <erlingre> anyone know how to select the resolution used on vga out? I use 1024x768 on the LCD (laptop) but get a weird widescreen 1300 x 768 on the projector.
[06:29] <DAZE-AdaR> I think its alright, how can I check?
[06:30] <Stormx2> DAZE-AdaR: First I suggest you check the MD5 sum of the .iso you downloaded
[06:30] <DAZE-AdaR> "kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown block(1,0)
[06:30] <p33k4y> nolimitsoya was it the same with breezy ?
[06:30] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, select check cd for defects when boothing it :)
[06:30] <edan> i installed ati drivers (8.28.8) and it works slow (very very slow) can anyone help?
[06:30] <nolimitsoya> p33k4y, no. as of dapper, the default install is a live system
[06:30] <nolimitsoya> p33k4y, there is also an alternate install cd if you want to do an advanced install
[06:30] <nolimitsoya> !alternate
[06:30] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[06:31] <artusom> Hello, Wonder if anyone can shed some light on a startx problem with "edgy" -- from "live" cd, Xserver not starting -- using NVidia 7600GS with sli -- can cntl-alt-F1 to terminal -- tried safe mode with no luck
[06:31] <DAZE-AdaR> "check cd for defects" gives me the same error
[06:32] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, then try to burn another cd, prefferably with k3b and the option 'check/validate' or something...
[06:32] <p33k4y> so i ca run a 'rescue mode' but not a 'expert mode' from the live cd right?
[06:32] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, if its a cdrw, try a -r
[06:32] <w3ccv> DAZE-AdaR, chedk the MD5 of the ISO, chedk the MD5 of the CD too.
[06:32] <DAZE-AdaR> ok
[06:32] <amoren> hola
[06:32] <edan> i installed ati drivers (8.28.8) and it works slow (very very slow) can anyone help?
[06:32] <DAZE-AdaR> how can I check the md5 of the CD?
[06:32] <amoren> 8
[06:32] <p33k4y> !Desktop
[06:32] <ubotu> The available desktop environments in Ubuntu are Gnome (ubuntu-desktop), KDE (kubuntu-desktop), XCFE (xubuntu-desktop), IceWM, Fluxbox, WindowMaker (wmaker), FVWM  and others.
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> p33k4y, not sure what you mean... if you want to use lvm partitioning, set up an oem install or somethin other out of the ordinary, you want the laternate install. for normal use, use the desktop cd
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, use md5
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, man md5
[06:33] <tuxub> how can i download the debs for some packages even if they are already installed?
[06:33] <amoren> que
[06:33] <amoren> no
[06:33] <DAZE-AdaR> I don't have it
[06:33] <w3ccv> DAZE-AdaR, if you're starting from a *nix system, dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/tmp/tempcd.iso, see if the wholde thing copies back
[06:33] <amoren> bhrbuyhguioe
[06:34] <emss> where is the source for the Ubuntu GNOME style located?
[06:34] <DAZE-AdaR> im on windows
=== doki|away is now known as doki
[06:34] <amoren> h
[06:34] <emss> or what is the official name of the Ubuntu GNOME style?
[06:34] <amoren> ihgff
[06:34] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, just do a reburn
[06:34] <strawtarget> generic linux question as applies to an Ubuntu LTS LAMP system: Is it correct to assume that the www-data user is "secure"?  That is to say, it's not possible for another user to gain access to a directory readable only by www-data, right?
[06:34] <amoren> 9uyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[06:34] <Agrajag> emss: Human
[06:34] <amoren> ko99999999
[06:34] <defrysk> tuxub, sudo apt-get install -d <package> I think
[06:34] <nolimitsoya> emss, that would be ubuntu ;)
[06:34] <wizo> hey, im getting errors like /bin/sh: line 0: cd: /lib/modules/2.6.15-23-server/build: No such file or directory, what could be wrong?
[06:34] <emss> Agrajag, thanks
[06:34] <amoren> jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
[06:35] <tuxub> defrysk, txs... and is it possible to install all .debs in a dir at once?
[06:35] <emss> strawtarget, www-data is a group?
[06:35] <mark__> any reason why burning an image always produces unreadable CDs while same image works fine when burnt with win-nero? I tried k3b, nerolinux, etc.
[06:35] <defrysk> tuxub, you mean download ?
[06:35] <nolimitsoya> tuxub, ive never tried itm but you could try 'sudo dpkg -i *'
[06:36] <p33k4y> is apt-get still there or it was replaced by something else?
[06:36] <DAZE-AdaR> what is the correct hash of ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso
[06:36] <tuxub> defrysk, download is ok. i get it. but then I need to get all the debs to a machine withou net and install on i
[06:36] <strawtarget> emss, yeah
[06:36] <tuxub> t
[06:36] <emss> mark__, what are you using to burn the image?
[06:36] <nolimitsoya> p33k4y, apt is still where?
[06:36] <tuxub> maybe nolimitsoya is right
[06:36] <Stormx2> DAZE-AdaR: It'll be next to the iso download link on the download page
[06:36] <p33k4y> nolimitsoya in ubuntu ...
[06:36] <mark__> emss: i used k3b and nerolinux
[06:36] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, there is a file on the ftp contaning the right md5 hash :)
[06:36] <strawtarget> emss, I think it's created as part of the apache2 package, or maybe some http-server metapackage
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> p33k4y, apt is a cornerstone of debian, so yes, apt is still there
[06:37] <p33k4y> using the same repositories as debian or ubuntu has it's own repositories ?
[06:37] <defrysk> tuxub, sudo dpkg -i /path/to/containingfolder/*
[06:37] <DAZE-AdaR> oh... the md5 of my iso is wrong
[06:37] <DAZE-AdaR> mine is totally different from the one on http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/MD5SUMS
[06:37] <emss> strawtarget, unless that user is in the group or the directory is worl readable or the user can elevate her/his priveleges
[06:37] <tuxub> defrysk, ok, txs
[06:38] <nolimitsoya> p33k4y, ubuntu has its own repos, wich are synced to debian on a schedule
[06:38] <emss> mark__, well try to mount the burned cd
[06:38] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, youd want the 6.06.1 hash, not 6.06
[06:38] <p33k4y> thanx
[06:38] <DAZE-AdaR> yep that site is the 6.06.1 hash
[06:38] <DAZE-AdaR> fb3af44c21f1f68cc25fda7edb8c1bd3  ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso
[06:38] <DAZE-AdaR> it says
[06:39] <nolimitsoya> http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06.1/MD5SUMS DAZE-AdaR
[06:39] <mark__> emss: the final verification fails in both cases with read errors and the cd (kubuntu) is unbootable
[06:39] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, then just redownload the image
[06:39] <emss> mark__, no try to mount the cd
[06:39] <DAZE-AdaR> arrrg
[06:39] <strawtarget> emss, okay, that's what I thought.  I guess there are also some subtle things to think about, like if I allow a user to have a ~/public_html then they could easily write their own script that accessed the private folder since their script would execute as www-data I think.
[06:39] <DAZE-AdaR> it took ages =/ but ok
[06:39] <LiraNuna> hello
[06:39] <nolimitsoya> DAZE-AdaR, use getright, or some similar download accelerator that can help you get thing... well, right ;)
[06:39] <emss> mark__, not to boot it, maybe the image is being burned as a file to the cd instead of being expanded or whatever the correct terminology is
[06:40] <strawtarget> I just want to mkae sure I don't do a bone-head thing by considering www-data secure or private if it really isn't due to lots of things I"m not thinking of (like that user-home-script  thing I mentioned)
[06:40] <ChrisBradley> hello
[06:40] <LiraNuna> i installed windows and i can't run ubuntu now
[06:40] <Stormx2> DAZE-AdaR: The hash is wrong? ul

[06:40] <ChrisBradley> MediaWiki works fine first time with Ubuntu 64
[06:40] <emss> mark__, you can try in a console typing 'cdrecord cdrom.img' that should burn it properly
[06:40] <defrysk> DAZE-AdaR, or download the torrent and put the bad image in the folder first, the client wil then first check the iso you have and continue from there
[06:40] <LiraNuna> well i know
[06:40] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: Read what ubotu put
[06:40] <LiraNuna> i'm trying to restore grub

[06:40] <ChrisBradley> So does HP F300 Scanner - With XSane
[06:40] <nolimitsoya> BSDnux, -generic has obsoleted all other as of edgy
[06:40] <emss> strawtarget, exactly
[06:40] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: When issuing what command?
=== dou213_ is now known as dou213
[06:41] <DAZE-AdaR> thanks defryst- I think I might get 6.10 now though
[06:41] <BSDnux> is generic 386 or 686?
[06:41] <defrysk> DAZE-AdaR, better even :)
[06:41] <vikash> when i shutdown ubuntu 6.10  i dont get any screen  just a blinking cursor
[06:41] <LiraNuna> Stormx2: hold on
[06:41] <nolimitsoya> BSDnux, as i said, -generi has obsoleted all other kernels
[06:41] <vikash> for 30 seconds then system goes down

[06:42] <defrysk> BSDnux, yup
[06:42] <BSDnux> ok
[06:42] <vikash>  when i shutdown ubuntu 6.10  i dont get any screen  just a blinking cursor for 30 seconds then system goes down
[06:42] <vikash> can somebody tell me
[06:42] <LiraNuna> and i'm preety sure i have a partition setted up
[06:42] <vikash> ??
[06:42] <defrysk> vikash, everything fine then :)
[06:42] <DAZE-AdaR> closing IRC now, ill be back later if it doesnt work- thanks for your help :)
[06:42] <vikash> but it doesnot show anything
[06:42] <Imrahil> how long would one expect until xorg 7.2 is pushed out for edgy? xorg release schedule calls for December 11
[06:42] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: Thats odd... looks like it hasn't detected your disk
[06:42] <mark__> emss: ok, I'll sacrifice my last CD to try the cdrecord trick. By the way: the cd is written correctly. To be more precise, it boots but when I choose "Install" from the menu it fails because of reading errors.
[06:42] <bXi> are there any decent xgl guides for edgy 64bit ?
[06:42] <w3ccv> vikash, sounds ok to me, there comes a point when screen drivers are closed and the kernel isn't quite dead
[06:42] <vikash> same happedned with startup
[06:42] <defrysk> vikash, what doe you want to see ?
[06:43] <LiraNuna> Stormx2: :(
[06:43] <defrysk> bling bling ?
[06:43] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: Is this from the ubuntu live cd?
[06:43] <BSDnux> another question: i can't get my audio card's line-in to work... when i use tvtime i get a picture, but i can't even move the volume control. when i connect the speakers directly to the tv-card's line-out i hear sound. any hints?
[06:43] <emss> mark__, oh don't burn
[06:43] <LiraNuna> Stormx2: what else?
[06:43] <emss> mark__, you should md5 check the cd image then
[06:43] <matju> if i plug a second mouse in my system, but i don't want it to be used by X11, what should i do?
[06:43] <vikash> defrysk: i want to see messages
[06:43] <mark__> emss: too late :-)
[06:43] <LiraNuna> Stormx2: is there another option?
[06:43] <BSDnux> should i compile the latest alsa-drivers?
[06:43] <vikash> defrysk: like ubuntu 6.06
[06:43] <emss> mark__, the image is probably messed up
[06:43] <defrysk> vikash, I never see messages ,
[06:43] <emss> mark__, incomplete that is
[06:43] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: The alternate install cd... and there are some other options I think
[06:43] <defrysk> vikash, the messagedays are over
[06:43] <w3ccv> matju, unplut it
[06:44] <nolimitsoya> defrysk, you should be getting usplash
[06:44] <LiraNuna> also
[06:44] <LiraNuna> grub> find /boot/grub/stage1
[06:44] <LiraNuna> Error 15: File not found
[06:44] <nolimitsoya> !usplash | vikash
[06:44] <ubotu> vikash: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[06:44] <defrysk> nolimitsoya, why ?
[06:44] <mark__> emss: I already verified it. the same file works well when burnt with nero for windwos
[06:44] <matju> w3ccv: no, i want to use it as HID with another app.
[06:44] <nolimitsoya> defrysk, if you dont, something is broken
[06:44] <defrysk> oh I see splashscreens
[06:44] <vikash> defrysk: in 6.10....
[06:44] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: Or use the grub super cd
[06:44] <defrysk> I thought that was wat he ment
[06:44] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: Eeek! Thats odd. Did you let windows take up all your disk space?
[06:44] <nolimitsoya> defrysk, yes, it is. hes not seeing them ;)
[06:44] <matju> if i plug a second mouse in my system, but i don't want it to be used by X11, what should i do? I want to use the HID/LinuxEvent interface using a custom program.
[06:45] <LiraNuna> Stormx2: i removed windows
[06:45] <LiraNuna> i got:
[06:45] <defrysk> vikash, did you upgrade ?
[06:45] <mark__> emss: cdrecord tells me "Error: Cannot gain SYS_RAWIO capability.Is cdrecord installed SUID root?" but burns nevertheless
[06:45] <vikash> defryskL no fresh install
[06:45] <emss> mark__, ok then I doubt you will have any different results, because k3b is just a frontend to command line programs: cdrecord, cdrdao etc.
[06:45] <defrysk> hmm
[06:45] <BSDnux> matju, remove the input device from xorg.conf
[06:45] <edan> need help with ati driver install
[06:45] <defrysk> and @ boot up you get a splash ?
[06:46] <LiraNuna> grub> setup (hd0)
[06:46] <LiraNuna> Error 12: Invalid device requested
[06:46] <vikash> no ...
[06:46] <defrysk> oooh
[06:46] <LiraNuna> grub> setup (hd0,0)
[06:46] <LiraNuna> Error 12: Invalid device requested
[06:46] <vikash> i changed that to no splash
[06:46] <wizo> hey, how can i find out the kernel path?
[06:46] <vikash> now it tales less time
[06:46] <Stormx2> LiraNuna: Eek
[06:46] <vikash> than before
[06:46] <defrysk> vikash, sudo apt-get install usplash
[06:46] <defrysk> vikash, upstart is faster
[06:46] <fujiX> anyone know if 6.10 will support higher resolutions in an upcoming update?
[06:46] <matju> BSDnux: it's not in xorg.conf, it was hotplugged, added automatically.
[06:46] <mark__> emss: I read somewhere that TAO mode could cause some problems with certain drives.
[06:47] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, the resolutions you can use is dependant on you graphics driver. not ubuntu
[06:47] <vikash> defrysk   its already installed
[06:47] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, if you are just getting xga, you might be using vesa drivers. change that :)
[06:47] <defrysk> vikash, not sure then maybe nolimitsoya knows ?
[06:47] <nolimitsoya> nope, idont :)
[06:48] <vikash> ok  guys anways thanx
[06:48] <fujiX> nolimitsoya im running nvidia drivers...i think ^^
[06:48] <defrysk> vikash, it must be a vga setting in menu.lst
[06:48] <LiraNuna> yay i did it!
[06:48] <LiraNuna> i had to use the grub from my hda
[06:48] <defrysk> must be too high but not sure about howto
[06:48] <LiraNuna> *hda1
[06:48] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config'
[06:49] <LiraNuna> thanks for that guide folks
[06:49] <LiraNuna> bye
[06:49] <fujiX> nolimitsoya yeah
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, if the last part doesnt work, run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select driver 'nvidia'
[06:49] <defrysk> fujiX, in edgy ?
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, then rerun 'nvidia-glx-config
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> '
[06:49] <defrysk> fujiX, in edgy run sudo nvidia-xconfig
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, just cut and paste the commands :)
[06:50] <defrysk> nolimitsoya, its nvidia-glx-config enable
[06:50] <mark__> bye
[06:50] <defrysk> its for dapper and older
[06:51] <ThePub> good morning!  Would someone be able to point me at some documentation about getting the latest ATI driver working with Edgy?

[06:51] <Super_Cat_Frog> hi - anybody have any ideas how i can record a video of my desktop without using vmware?
[06:51] <nolimitsoya> defrysk, hm... worked for me in edgy :)
[06:51] <defrysk> nolimitsoya, I have a hard time beleiving it but hey I am not kidding
[06:51] <wizo> hey, i need the kernel path, i thought i would find it in /usr/src, but then it issint in there
[06:51] <wizo> what can i do
[06:51] <bowman> hi. what do I need in order to grab X11 video for screencasts? ffmpeg tells me "could not find video grab device"
[06:51] <nolimitsoya> defrysk, try it :)
[06:51] <fujiX> nolimitsoya well, everything seems to be ok. running xgl and all, its just that i cant change my res higher then 1024x768
[06:51] <defrysk> no i have nvidia up and running ;)
[06:52] <nolimitsoya> defrysk, run it without invoking and command, and youll see its alive ;)
[06:52] <php-freak> Hey guys do you know of a better way to see all my fonts on my screen, and stuf cause my display just don't seem that clear do you guys know what im talking about?

[06:56] <fujiX> problem is that i dont know what to look for :P
[06:57] <aleka> I have a simple apache Q. I have trying to map my webroot directory from /var/www to ~/www... and used the following directive in /etc/apache2/conf.d "Alias /var/www  /home/name/www/

[06:59] <maynoth> Hello
[06:59] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, scroll down to the screen section and add the resolutions you want under modes under the subsection 'display' for all color depths
[06:59] <A3n> how do i get dhcp to work with my wireless? "wireless tools for linux" can scan all AP's including my own but i dont seem to be able to get dhcp from it
[06:59] <kmaynard> aleka, you may have better luck using ~/public_html
[06:59] <maynoth> does anyone here have that link to the script which can automount partitions?
[07:00] <wizo> why are my kernel headers  kernel-headers-2.4.27-2 2.4.27-12 when uname -a says that i have 2.6.15..
[07:00] <aleka> kmaynard I am not following,,,
[07:00] <w3ccv> A3n, what encryption are you using?
[07:01] <A3n> none
[07:01] <fujiX> nolimitsoya weird. there are higher resolutions there but i still cant select them in prefs.
[07:01] <nolimitsoya> wizo, apt-get install kernel-headers
[07:01] <kmaynard> aleka, instead of ~/www, use ~/public_html   it's a special apache directory. look it up in the docs for how to enable it. i've never been able to get odd directories in ~ to work correctly
[07:01] <maynoth> hello... can anyone here help me mount a parition in edgy
[07:01] <nolimitsoya> wizo, that package will always depend on the latest headers
[07:01] <ripper> when i mount a spare drive in /media/storage (which is chmod'd 777), no matter how i mount it, only root can write to it, but yet the drive shows as being mounted rw, what can i do to fix this?
[07:01] <fujiX> nolimitsoya but i suspect something isnt right in that file... problem is i dont know what
[07:02] <nolimitsoya> maynoth, just 'sudo mount <partition> -t <filesystem> /<mountpoint>
[07:02] <wizo> nolimitsoya, i did, but they only show me 2.4.*, but uname -a says that i have 2.6.15 etc.. so which kernel header should i choose?
[07:02] <A3n> w3ccv: iwscan finds my ap and iwconfig sets my ap and all that everything is fine, but dhclient just cant find dhcp
[07:02] <A3n> w3ccv: and i have no idea why
[07:02] <wizo> nolimitsoya, it says that i should explicitly choose one
[07:02] <nolimitsoya> wizo, if youve installed the kernel-headers package youll just have to sudo apt-get upgrade
[07:02] <kevin_> myellow
[07:03] <maynoth> nolimitsoya will that permanently mount it?
[07:03] <wizo> nolimitsoya, im lost now
[07:03] <nolimitsoya> fujiX, use pastebin and link it. perhaps someone will be able to spot something
[07:03] <nolimitsoya> maynoth, make an entry to fstab
[07:03] <kevin_> what yall need help with
[07:03] <w3ccv> A3n, can you look at the AP, the log should tell if you connected
[07:03] <wizo> which kernel header should i choose? there are 8 to choose from when i do sudo apt-get install kernel-headers
[07:04] <kevin_> most recent?
[07:04] <scythe128> kevin nothing but what frued could figure out
[07:04] <A3n> w3ccv: what log? dmesg?
[07:04] <ripper> nolimitsoya im having a problem getting write access to a storage drive on my box, it shows as being mounted rw, but yet only root can write to it
[07:04] <nolimitsoya> wizo, just cut and paste this 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install linux-headers && sudo apt-get upgrade'
[07:04] <maynoth> my device is hda3 can you tell me what I need to write in the fstab
[07:04] <Crescendo> Xchat opens links in Mozilla instead of Firefox after the upgrade to Edgy - how can I remedy this?
[07:04] <maynoth> sorry im a mega n00b
[07:04] <w3ccv> A3n, the AP log, you will need to connect to it's admin interface
[07:04] <nolimitsoya> ripper, youll have to chmod, or chowm as appropriate
[07:04] <fujiX> nolimitsoya sry pastebin? :) and link it where?
[07:04] <kevin_> check out ubuntuguide.org itll tell you pretty much everything

[07:05] <ripper> nolimitsoya done that too
[07:05] <khoa> anyone know why in "Update Manager" I have 2 packages greyed out?
[07:05] <khoa> in particular "libggi2" and "mplayer"
[07:05] <A3n> ow nvm tha
[07:05] <nolimitsoya> maynoth, /dev/hda3 <mount point> <filesystem type> defaults 0 2
[07:05] <w3ccv> A3n, thught you may have another way in.
[07:06] <nolimitsoya> ripper, mounted with defaults, or nouser?
[07:06] <A3n> w3ccv: well i dont remember being a log there
[07:06] <wizo> nolimitsoya, ah, now i have more choices to choose from
[07:06] <khoa> they are under the "Distribution Updates" section, and they won't allow me to click on them, also it already says my system is up-to-date
[07:06] <ripper> nolimitsoya mounted with defaults
[07:06] <w3ccv> A3n, tail dmesg or tail -f /var/log/messages to see what your connection is doing
[07:06] <nolimitsoya> wizo, you can try out 'man fstab' for documentation onhow to use it
[07:07] <fujiX> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35451/
[07:07] <wizo> ?

[07:07] <maynoth> ok thank you...
[07:07] <maynoth> do I need to create a mount point first?
[07:07] <A3n> omg i think i know what the problem is
[07:07] <nolimitsoya> wizo, if you want in depth explainations of what everything does, just typ 'man fstab' in a terminal
[07:07] <A3n> i'm in my router config
[07:08] <A3n> it says DHCP to my dads, moms and sis pc but to me it says reserved
[07:08] <nolimitsoya> wizo, sorry... i think i might be talking to the wrong person :P
[07:08] <A3n> lol
[07:08] <wizo> lol yea i think so too
[07:08] <wizo> anyway, i think i found the correct header to apt-get install, thanks
[07:08] <w3ccv> A3n, ah ha!  most problems should be that simple
[07:08] <A3n> i think i go install my internet driver from the firmwire and set it to dhcp lol
[07:08] <A3n> lucky for me this is an easy solution

[07:09] <A3n> and thx

[07:31] <azion> Hello all, I've just installed 6.10, and when I login the screen becomes distorted and locks up. Can anyone help me fix this?
[07:31] <talis> Hello everyone, I have just installed 6.10 and it seems every torrent client I have installed freezes my system up. I have tried BitTornado, qBittorrent, Azureus, Ktorrent and they all work for about 2 minutes and lock my system up. The only one that does not lock the system up doesn't download anything. It just sits there and does nothing at all. Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?
[07:33] <Vorbote> talis: that seems a problem with your network interface and/or kernel driver for such hardware.
[07:34] <cgcx> anybody know what the latest word is on compatibility with p965 motherboards? If I buy an Asus P5B, will I be able to run Edgy?
[07:34] <maynoth> Thank you so much
[07:34] <najand> Hello All
[07:34] <maynoth> that worked great after a reboot
[07:34] <najand> What is up tonight?
[07:34] <zaink1> Hi... Why cant i install rpm packages when using Ubuntu 6.06
[07:34] <maynoth> I wish ubuntu shipped with a gui to do that
[07:34] <maynoth> :(
[07:34] <talis> Vorbote: I figured it had to be something on those lines as all that software cannot be at fault and do the same thing. Any suggestions?
[07:35] <najand> maynoth: Why do you need rpms? When there are much easier to use deb packages?
[07:35] <Vorbote> zaink1: because Debian and its derivatives do not use rpm as package format, but you can always use alien to convert them (and break your system 99% of the time).
[07:35] <Seveas> zaink1, because rpm is a rather bad program and the rpm packaging format is infrior to the .deb format. Ubuntu uses .deb packages
[07:35] <Seveas> zaink1, and software on ubuntu is installed via the package manager, not by downloading random packages :)
[07:36] <maynoth> rpms? i think you got the wrong guy...
[07:36] <maynoth> I was mounting a ext3 partition in edgy
[07:36] <najand> Sorry
[07:36] <najand> maynoth:
[07:36] <najand> maynoth: sorry
[07:36] <maynoth> dont be
[07:36] <maynoth> hehe
[07:36] <maynoth> just tell who ever helped me edit my fstab thank you
[07:37] <Vorbote> talis: I suggest you check the level of support your hardware has in linux with a google search. (lspci will tell you the name of your network interface, usually)
[07:37] <jughead> how do I kill a non-responsive firefox via command line?
[07:37] <najand> maynoth: Hmm.... Anyone here can help me with YABOOT in Ubuntu(PPC)?
[07:38] <talis> Vorbote: thanks very much, most appreciated. :)
[07:38] <Moosejaw> all off the apps i open in ubuntu seem to be stuck to the top toolbar...how can i fix this, as of last night they were freely moveable
[07:38] <Moosejaw> can someone tell me what to do?
[07:38] <Adrian> jughead: killall firefox
[07:39] <notwist> what burn program can i use besides "burn"?
[07:39] <maynoth> (gedit:4787): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Failed to open session DBUS connection: Did not receive a reply.
[07:39] <Vorbote> Seveas: He! I wouldn't go as far a say that rpm is inferior. Rather that most people packaging rpms are doing a shoddy work. On downloading random install packages, to me that's suicide by drive-by shooting...
[07:39] <maynoth> I get that error every time after I update edgy
[07:39] <najand> jughead: killall firefox-bin
[07:39] <maynoth> is it a big deal?
[07:39] <Seveas> Vorbote, rpm is inferior as well, the bad behaviour from people just makes it worse
[07:40] <Vorbote> Seveas: I agree with you that rpm is brittle as old bones :-)
[07:40] <najand> maynoth: What is the error?
[07:40] <VigoFusio1> I have a bad config error, looks like I goofed something up, but I am pretty ignorant to Linux,,,,still,,,
[07:40] <najand> maynoth: Maybe you have some broken packages
[07:40] <maynoth> (gedit:4787): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Failed to open session DBUS connection: Did not receive a reply.
[07:41] <Vorbote> maynoth: the D-BUS error should not interfere with the upgrade. (Nothing broke here whan that happened).
[07:41] <notwist> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35454/ <- anyone, please? If no idea, atleast a tip for another burning software
[07:41] <maynoth> well i only get that error after I upgrade
[07:42] <w3ccv> jughead, a) ps -ef | grep firefox  b) note the PID c) kill -9 (that PID)
[07:42] <maynoth> sorry thats what I meant
[07:43] <zaink1> Well, I might be the stupid one arround here, but I guess there is a way to install rpm packages somehow. I have downloaded som tools from www.cadsoft.de, however, i youst noticed they got tgz as well, but thats all they offer
[07:43] <notwist> zaink1: you can install rpm packages with "alien"
[07:43] <notwist> zaink1: convert them to .deb anyway
[07:43] <jughead> the killall firefox-bin worked thanks guys
[07:45] <Jinkguns> hmm
[07:46] <Jinkguns> how do I build from a extract force directory?

[07:46] <Jinkguns> is it, ./configure make ?
[07:46] <Jinkguns> make install ?
[07:46] <blekos> does anyone have the original xorg configuration?
[07:46] <zaink1> thanks, bye
[07:46] <blekos> something went wrong and my screen is smaller than is should be
[07:47] <blekos> i cant afford re-installing Ubuntu again (for 3rd time)...
[07:47] <malt> why belkos
[07:47] <malt> ubuntu is free :P
[07:47] <munroe> It's smaller ? So you're resolution is lower than it should be?

[07:55] <tuna-fish-> dumb question: if I wanna read stuff directly from /dev/hdaX and output it into stdout what should i use?
[07:55] <Surghi> VigoFusio1, I do not have a keyboard

[07:57] <nite> It kinda seems like I'm going to have to try wine for the DXG movie camara but I really hate to use microsoft junk on linux was looking for an alternative way to get the camara working.
[07:57] <VigoFusio1> Surghi: I have a very nice one here, if it possible for me to do, I will start a file and lay some tracks down for you. I will have to do alotta learning fast. but that is all I can think of, make your own, or get someone you know to play some sounds.
[07:57] <IdleOne> wildchild:  sorry dont know what to say but you can try xmms
[07:57] <dsquare> i have installed photoshop (6) using wine and the install seemed successful, bot i do not know how to start the program!! please tell me how to find it, or install it under wine so that i can access it?
[07:57] <Surghi> VigoFusio1: sounds good
[07:57] <dsquare> how to find and run it, i should say.
[07:58] <IdleOne> dsquare: wine programname should start it up
[07:58] <VigoFusio1> Surghi: Wait! Gutenberg Project or Library of Congress, they have Sound Files that are Public Domain.
[07:58] <dsquare> idle, well when i ran the install, it seemed to launch in wine
[07:59] <Bo36> Does anybody know a program to read .lit files? (lit = m$ e-book)
[07:59] <wildchild> IdleOne: xmms are codecs ?
[07:59] <IdleOne> dsquare:  yes and you will need to run the program in wine also
[07:59] <dsquare> idle, but now i don't know how to access wine or the location of photoshop (one default (program/files/adobe/photoshop) and one in my home folder..
[07:59] <dsquare> idle, how do i do that?
[07:59] <VigoFusio1> Gutenburg may nt have many sound files, but I know LoC does.
[07:59] <Surghi> VigoFusio1, Wonderful!
[07:59] <tuna-fish-> dsquare: yeah. from terminal cd .wine/drive_c/
[07:59] <IdleOne> wildchild: xmms is a app that plays music
[08:00] <tuna-fish-> dsquare: that is where standard wine c drive is
[08:00] <IdleOne> dsquare:  in terminal type wine photoshop.exe I believe
[08:00] <tuna-fish-> Idleone: gotta be in photoshop working directory I believe

[08:01] <dsquare> (wine: could not load L"c:\\windows\\system32\\photoshop.exe": Module not found) for "wine photoshop.exe"  and (bash: cd: .wine/drive_C/: No such file or directory) for that command..

[08:06] <kevin_> I have ubuntu 6.06, and I can't read or write to my windows drive (it's a separate HDD). I can see it in the "computer" view, it's labeled as 233.8 GB volume. I've tried to mount it, but it won't mount.  any ideas as to what to do?
[08:06] <VigoFusio1> blizzard97: You can disable VNC in one of the Gnome Panels, or use a sudu, but I do not know Linux commands, yet

[08:08] <Surghi> thank you VigoFusio1
[08:08] <Celldweller> command to change mod?
[08:08] <Celldweller> chmod

[08:09] <Celldweller> now what do i do
[08:10] <bray> Celldweller: I'm not totally sure... either way I've got to get going. So good luck with that. I'd have a look in the wiki and forums to see if anyone else had the same problem.
[08:10] <Celldweller> looked in those
[08:10] <Celldweller> they are for file permissions only
[08:11] <bray> Huh... well... yeah, good luck... not much I can tell ya.
[08:12] <VigoFusion> Surghi: What type of sounds? or music? you can edit and do what you like

[08:15] <NineTeen67Comet> Whelp .. I've got myself an OLD Gateway mobo (Intel) and tossed it in my new case (simple case with a power/reset button and a couple LED lights). I found it online and tried to hook up the front panel as shown in the instructions. But, it will boot and stops (all night) at the Gateway logo just before the bios fires up. I took the battery out for about 15 minutes, and re-checked my connections. I swapped all the ram around and still it 
[08:16] <kevin_> is the cpu good?
[08:16] <VigoFusion> Surghi: http://search.loc.gov:8765/query.html?col=loc&qt=public+domain&qp=url%3A%2Frr%2Frecord%2F&submit.x=0&submit.y=0
[08:16] <wow_at_noplay> can anyone tell me where to find ctx drivers for this
[08:17] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: I'm "assuming" so. I don't have another to test it with (PII) .. think I might just see if anyone around here is tossing out an old computer (I like using old computers as my servers) ..
[08:17] <mrlinux> when using a thin client i try to load flash but it crashes the client but the server works fine
[08:18] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: It did just spend three days in my luggage .. lol .. could'a snapped something in the old cpu connection (it stands up on it's side) ..
[08:18] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: I've had good experiences with P2s and 3s
[08:19] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: I dont' think that it's bad
[08:19] <kevin_> although, if it was in the luggage, it could have gotten a ESD
[08:19] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: ditto .. they seem to handle the few web sites I run, and toss around files in the house along with handeling the printer duties .. all goes well ..
[08:19] <Surghi> how can I listen to *.mid files please?
[08:19] <Surghi> thank you VigoFusion 1
[08:20] <wow_at_noplay> ctx drivers for ubuntu 5.01 anyone . refresh rate on this sux\
[08:20] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: I had it in the static bag .. hopefully that was enough ..
[08:20] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: it should be
[08:20] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: is it the exact same as the one that was in previously?
[08:20] <NineTeen67Comet> I think my wifes friend has an old bobo I can have .. I swaped in a new one when she had some issues with her computer .. (Turned out to be her power switch was grounded out to the computer case) ..
[08:20] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: mhz and all that?
[08:21] <VigoFusion> Surghi: it is $1.50 per CD, thats not bad
[08:21] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: you might have to set the timing on the mobo manually
[08:21] <Surghi> thats true
[08:21] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: I had to do that to mine
[08:22] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: naw, this bobo/cpu/ram is all out of another box.
[08:22] <ripaki> I need help to get TwinhanDTV Alpha work with edgy

[08:22] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet:  and you did clear the cmos, right?
[08:23] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet: what about a bad floppy drive?
[08:23] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: I can't find the bios jumpers so I pulled the battery for 15-20 minutes .. I think I found the cmos jumpers and moved the jumper back and forth (it's right next to the jumpers for front panel USB) ..
[08:23] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: no floppy installed ..
[08:24] <kevin_> NineTeen67Comet:  try taking the battery out and then taking the power cord out, then pressing the power button and that might clear any static charges
[08:24] <soundray> NineTeen67Comet: some boards you have to power up with the jumper in the reset position to actually reset the CMOS
[08:24] <kevin_> that too
[08:25] <Sybux> ave
[08:25] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: Okay .. I'll give that'n a try .. (both) ..
[08:26] <kevin_> any1 here know how to handle this:

[08:26] <bipolar> kevin_: what is it formated as?
[08:26] <kevin_> ntfs
[08:26] <soundray> kevin_: if you can see it in the computer view, it normally means that it is already mounted
=== doki is now known as doki|Mcdo
[08:27] <soundray> kevin_: check with 'mount' in a terminal.
[08:27] <kevin_> soundray: yeah, but I can't read or write to it
[08:27] <kevin_> soundray: how do i do that
[08:27] <soundray> kevin_: open a terminal (Alt-F2, enter 'gnome-terminal') and run 'mount'
[08:28] <kevin_> ok
[08:28] <kevin_> then what
[08:28] <soundray> kevin_: look at the output and see if you can make sense of it
[08:28] <soundray> kevin_: how is it connected? IDE? SATA? Channel of its own? Slave drive?
[08:29] <kevin_> I'm a linux n00b, it's all greek to me
[08:29] <kevin_> soundray: it's an ide drive of it's won
[08:29] <Adnarim> hi

[08:31] <soundray> Adnarim: mount it to a mountpoint outside of /media
[08:31] <ChrisBradley> we're up on port 80 \o/ woot!
[08:31] <kevin_> soundray: it did nothing
[08:31] <xzk> I was in class earlier today and i got to test and see if the wifi on my laptop worked since i configured it with a tutorial.. and when i was in class.. everything worked, firefox, gaim... except for the weather report and xchat :(   any ideas why?
[08:31] <Adnarim> soundray is that the only possibility?
[08:31] <soundray> kevin_: in that case I was wrong and it isn't mounted.
[08:31] <ChrisBradley> many thanks to ubuntu and Time Warner
[08:31] <Royito> hello i trying to use the amule mm but it says that i got a firewall and it dont want to give me ide high... so i try to configure the iptable but i dont know how to doit..., so im want to find  some graphic app for it... can anybody help me?
[08:31] <kevin_> but i can still see it
[08:32] <cheesy> i need a html editor like phase5 (syntax highlighting, project managment, syntax help..) what can i use
[08:32] <cheesy> ?
[08:32] <xzk> uh oh something is burning - brb
[08:32] <soundray> Adnarim: probably not, but everything else requires more low-level interventions
[08:33] <kevin_> soundray: how do i  mount it, i tried mount hdb1
[08:33] <Adnarim> k what is a "good" place for pemanently mounting partitions in the system? I thought media was the "right" one, soundray
[08:34] <soundray> kevin_: let's first try and identify the device name. Run 'sudo fstab -l' in the terminal. It will ask for your password and then list the hard disk devices.
[08:34] <xzk> Adnarim:   thats what i thought too.. is that not right?
[08:34] <soundray> kevin_: it's definitely not hdb, because hdb would denote a slave drive on IDE channel 0.
[08:34] <Raging_Hog> aren't the usual mount points in /mnt?
[08:35] <Zambezi> Is there a way to block IP that portscans?
[08:35] <cheesy> i need a html editor like phase5(win) (syntax highlighting, project managment, syntax help..) what can i use?
[08:35] <soundray> Raging_Hog: no, according to FHS, /mnt is a mountpoint of its own reserved for temporary manual mounts.
[08:35] <xzk> Raging_Hog:   i don't know i still haven't figured out the linux filesystem and folder abbreviation meanings
[08:35] <Royito> hello....
[08:35] <Royito>  im trying to use the amule mm but it says that i got a firewall and it dont want to give me ide high... so i try to configure the iptable but i dont know how to doit..., so im want to find  some graphic app for it... can anybody help me?
[08:35] <soundray> cheesy: screem, nvu, bluefish
[08:35] <kevin_> soundray: command not found
[08:35] <ripaki>  I need help to get TwinhanDTV Alpha work with edgy, does anyone know??
[08:35] <Adnarim> hmmm what shall I take now for a directory?
[08:36] <soundray> kevin_: sorry, 'sudo fdisk -l'
[08:36] <xzk> Adnarim:   I use /media
[08:36] <medic30420> here is a fun question: i have a cable modem, an ubuntu server w/2 network cards, a wireless router and 3 more ubuntu desktops.  Hooking everything up in that order, what software do I to install and configure to use the server as a gateway/firewall?
[08:36] <kevin_> soundray: ok
[08:36] <Raging_Hog> soundray, aah so it's just for manual. That's the way I've used to do it. Disregard me folks
[08:36] <Adnarim> I too but media gives this stupid icon
[08:36] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: thanks much for your help .. I did get a reset bios password screen for a second, but I hadn't hooked up the keyboard, and when I shut it down and brought it back it stuck again at the initial screen .. no biggie, off to finish unpacking . thanks again ..
[08:36] <jrib> !icons | Adnarim
[08:36] <ubotu> Adnarim: Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[08:37] <kevin_> No problem
[08:37] <kevin_> I love to help people with hardare
[08:37] <xzk> what is the difference between gnome and kde
[08:37] <Adnarim> ubotu I DON't want to see them :)
[08:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I DON't want to see them :) - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:37] <kevin_> it's the soft stuff that make smy head hurt
[08:37] <jrib> Adnarim: well it's a setting, so you can turn it off just like you turn it on
[08:37] <apokryphos> xzk: different desktop environment, stressing different values, having different default applications, different feel etc
[08:37] <NineTeen67Comet> kevin_: well I've got the softstuff in the *nix world working well (I have to fumble but I figure it out) .. take care ..
[08:37] <apokryphos> xzk: I recommend trying both out as well as you can for a week, then making up a decision
[08:37] <Adnarim> I'll try this
[08:38] <kevin_> you too
[08:38] <kevin_> soundray: so it sees it
[08:38] <xzk> apokryphos:   i thought linux was linux
[08:38] <kevin_> and it sees my other drive too
[08:38] <xzk> now i really am confused
[08:38] <Boopop> Hi al
[08:38] <soundray> kevin_: so what's the device name of your 322 GB partition?
[08:38] <Raging_Hog> what I saw in wikipedia about FHS, they say that /media is just for removable media. Does it mean also other hds?
[08:38] <kevin_> hda
[08:38] <apokryphos> xzk: linux has several desktop environments. GNOME and kde are the most popular
[08:38] <apokryphos> xzk: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[08:39] <xzk> what is a desktop environment?
[08:39] <kevin_> soundray: lemme guess,
[08:39] <Boopop> what does it mean if on ubuntu, my wifi card can see wireless networks, but cannot connect? Shall i just install ndiswrapper?
[08:39] <UbuntuCE> hi. who knows openoffice writer well?
[08:39] <kevin_> soundray: mount hda
[08:39] <eyalw> hi
[08:39] <soundray> kevin_: poor guess
[08:40] <kevin_> soundray:  i see
[08:40] <soundray> UbuntuCE: is this a survey or a help request?
[08:40] <cheesy> soundray: thanks i take nvu
[08:40] <kevin_> soundray: well, I tried
[08:40] <UbuntuCE> soundray: i have trouble with pages numering- i have 2-9 ok, but over them it`s still 1,1,1 etc.
[08:40] <soundray> kevin_: look through the fdisk -l output.
[08:40] <conn> hi, I'm using ubuntu, I'm wondering what the name is of the gnome app to change the system theme (icons etc)?
[08:41] <conn> I want to install it manually from the repo, but can't find using search
[08:41] <conn> *using kubuntu
[08:41] <soundray> UbuntuCE: can you rephrase that?
[08:41] <kevin_> soundray: and i'm looking for....
[08:41] <kevin_> soundray: hda1?
[08:41] <UbuntuCE> soundray: i write in writer
[08:41] <soundray> kevin_: a section with a plausible disk size and an NTFS partition
[08:42] <UbuntuCE> soundray: and number the pages
[08:42] <jojo__> whenever I try to type command "sudo /etc/firefox/firefoxrc" to get access to the file... my terminal says "command not found" ...why?
[08:42] <UbuntuCE> soundray: 2 to 9 are ok (2,3,4 etc.), but over 10 page all pages are named "1"
[08:42] <kevin_> soundray: i see it
[08:42] <kevin_> soundray: wait
[08:42] <Adnarim> there is no /apps/nautilus/desktop dir and file on my pc
[08:42] <soundray> jojo__: because firefoxrc isn't a command. Try sudo gedit /etc/firefox/firefoxrc
[08:43] <kevin_> soundray: by plausible you mean: the 200+gig one, right?
[08:43] <soundray> UbuntuCE: it's a space issue. Your page number is partly covered up.
[08:43] <soundray> kevin_: yes, if that's your only drive of that size
[08:43] <UbuntuCE> soundray: how to correct it?
[08:44] <kevin_> soundray: and then what?
[08:44] <soundray> UbuntuCE: depends on your layout. Try putting your page number in a footer or header and center it with Ctrl-E
[08:44] <kevin_> does anyone hear that!? nature calls! brb
[08:44] <piggyg1> YAY!!!!!
[08:45] <piggyg1> Ubuntu works on QEMU
[08:45] <Boopop> Can anybody help me install ndiswrapper?
[08:45] <soundray> kevin_: I need you to tell me the device name. Something like /dev/hdxY with x one of a b c d... and Y a number
[08:45] <UbuntuCE> soundray:  now all pages are "9"
[08:46] <Boopop> anybody?
[08:46] <blue-frog> gnome settings and xorg.conf apparently shows a us keyboard but in console (ctrl alt F1) I have fr keyboard, where do I find the conf file ruling console, pls?
[08:46] <soundray> UbuntuCE: have you placed your page numbers in a footer?
[08:46] <soundray> !ndiswrapper | Boopop

[08:46] <Boopop> thanks

[08:47] <kevin_> soundray: Disk /dev/hda: 251.0 GB, 251000193024 bytes
[08:47] <xorn> hi, i got some problem concerning ati and the screen resolution.. would anybody be so kind and help me out with it?!
[08:47] <soundray> kevin_: you need the device name of the NTFS partition
[08:48] <Boopop> ubotu - Ubuntu detects wifi networks through my cardbus wifi, but won't connect, even with no security. Do i need to install ndiswrapper? Thanks

[08:48] <Boopop> -_-
[08:48] <Boopop> lol
[08:48] <bluefox83> Boopop, ubotu = a bot

[08:48] <Boopop> I noticed, lmao
[08:48] <Boopop> thanks anyway :P
[08:49] <soundray> UbuntuCE: remove the 9 and do an Insert-Fields-Page Number
[08:49] <soundray> kevin_: what do you get when you 'sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt'?
[08:49] <Chris_Sutcliff> hi
[08:49] <Chris_Sutcliff> can anyone help me?
[08:49] <Chris_Sutcliff> im trying to compile a kernel
[08:49] <soundray> !kernelcompile | Chris_Sutcliff
[08:49] <ubotu> Chris_Sutcliff: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[08:49] <shwag> Chris_Sutcliff: with what ?
[08:49] <Chris_Sutcliff> and i get this error when the modules are compiled
[08:49] <shwag> Chris_Sutcliff: oh

[08:50] <ripaki> Does anyone have TwinhanDTV Alpha tv card?
[08:50] <kevin_> soundray: well, I didn't know you were supposed to put /mnt after it
=== guillote_GPL is now known as guillote_GNU
[08:50] <shwag> Chris_Sutcliff: what is  drivers/ide/pci/atiixp  ?
[08:51] <soundray> kevin_: it's just one possibility. If you use /mnt your drive contents will appear inside the directory /mnt/
[08:51] <jojo__> hey guys.  i'm runnin edgy eft; i just tried modifying firefoxrc.... commenting out the composite section in x.org.. essentially where is x.org??
[08:51] <kevin_> soundray:  it worked!
[08:51] <UbuntuCE> soundray:  i dit. but the situations is identitcal to the beggining
[08:51] <kevin_> soundray: only
[08:51] <soundray> kevin_: you can't write to NTFS
[08:51] <kevin_> soundray: i dont' have the permissinons necessary
[08:51] <bitzero> yo, can any one help me with a no direct rendering problem, with a ati x800 pci-e video card ?
[08:52] <kevin_> soundray: to see the contents
[08:52] <soundray> kevin_: this is a good time to read the documentation that ubotu will point you to:
[08:52] <soundray> !ntfs | kevin_
[08:52] <ubotu> kevin_: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse

[08:53] <jojo__> hey guys.  i'm runnin edgy eft; i just tried modifying firefoxrc.... commenting out the composite section in x.org.. essentially where is x.org??
[08:53] <shwag> Chris_Sutcliff: well take that out of your kernel config if that is what is erroring and you dont need it. duh
[08:53] <Chris_Sutcliff> good point
[08:53] <Chris_Sutcliff> thanks :)
[08:54] <SpareXX> can i install ubuntu over my windows partition and keep the other partition on the drive until i can get a backup of them?
[08:54] <jojo__> hey guys.  i'm runnin edgy eft; i just tried modifying firefoxrc.... commenting out the composite section in x.org.. essentially where is x.org??
[08:54] <Boopop> Can anyone help me install ndis wrapper?

[08:55] <UbuntuCE> soundray: any ideas why there is no 10,11, but 1,1,1 ?
[08:55] <soundray> SpareXX: it's possible, but not recommended. Best to have a full backup before you manipulate partitions.
[08:55] <Znortfl> Good day people, I am running Edgy Eft and I would like to use my newly-bought headset. But when I start the sound recorder and the input is set to ALSA it gives an error. If I set it to OSS it starts but I can record anything
[08:55] <crimsun> snow_leo: over half the world's human population are female. What are you on about?
[08:55] <SpareXX> hmm, ok
[08:55] <soundray> UbuntuCE: I told you, didn't you listen?
[08:56] <UbuntuCE> soundray:  it doesn`t work
[08:56] <kevin_> soundray: what should I do? As of Ubuntu 6.04 (Dapper Drake) there is slightly more NTFS writing support
[08:56] <kevin_> through a very experimental NTFS FUSE module. Using this seems to work but
[08:56] <kevin_> is NOT recommended. Do you want to use this?
[08:56] <UbuntuCE> soundray:  it`s still 1,1,1 instead of 10,11 etc.
[08:56] <bluefox83> Znortfl, make sure the input mici thingy is not muted in volume control
[08:56] <soundray> UbuntuCE: you have to give it enough space
[08:56] <jojo__> hey guys.  i'm runnin edgy eft; i just tried modifying firefoxrc.... commenting out the composite section in x.org.. essentially where is x.org??

[08:56] <soundray> UbuntuCE: the page numbers are there, but they are covered up. You might try reducing the font size to prove the point
[08:56] <bluefox83> jojo__, what? where is x.org?

[08:58] <bluefox83> Znortfl, i dunno..mine is on my taskbar beside my clock and load meters...
[08:58] <soundray> kevin_: first of all, if you have a backup, there's a way to recover.

[08:59] <soundray> kevin_: second, the features of NTFS that are used as standard are most likely well considered in the driver. It's when you use unusual NTFS features that your filesystem is at risk.
[08:59] <soundray> kevin_: data you haven't backed up is data you don't want ;)
[08:59] <Znortfl> bluefox83, no it isnt muted
=== eno is now known as eno-away
[08:59] <bluefox83> Znortfl, right click an empty spot on your taskbar, click "add to panel" and it'll bring up a little menu of mini apps to put on your taskbar..select the volume control one
[09:00] <xorn> I AM USING KDE --> kubuntu
[09:00] <soundray> kevin_: I think this is a quote from tonyyarusso
[09:00] <bluefox83> have it plugged into the right hole?
[09:00] <xorn> so it wont work
[09:00] <xorn> like it is written there
[09:00] <xorn> hi, i got some problem concerning ati and the screen resolution.. would anybody be so kind and help me out with it?!
[09:00] <Znortfl> bluefox83, there is only one card there that supports a mic, and it is not muted
[09:01] <bluefox83> Znortfl, then i say again..is the mic plugged into the right port?
[09:01] <tonyyarusso> soundray: What'd I say?
[09:01] <kevin_> soundray: if I make a partition on the 200 gig drive, (ntfs) seperate from the main windows one, and have all data that I want shared there availible to both OSs, is that a good idea?
[09:01] <soundray> tonyyarusso:  "Data you haven't backed up is data you don't want"?
[09:01] <Znortfl> bluefox83, red wire in red plug, green wire in green plug
[09:01] <kevin_> a good saying btw
[09:01] <soundray> kevin_: yes
[09:02] <tonyyarusso> soundray: Hmm...it's possible, but I'm usually not that witty.  Maybe I was having a good day!
[09:02] <snow_leo> What are you doing, suckers? I am flying...
[09:02] <kevin_> someone kick him
[09:02] <enjahova> Hello, I just installed postgresql-8.1 and I'm trying to restart it because I just changed the configuration, how do I do that
[09:02] <snow_leo> sorry..
[09:02] <kevin_> lol
[09:02] <soundray> kevin_: especially since you can create a non-NTFS filesystem - I'd recommend ext3 although you will have to install a driver in Windows to read/write to it.
[09:02] <bluefox83> Znortfl, sadly, they don't always follow the correct color sequence...check for the little symbol on it to make sure it's the mic hole
[09:02] <snow_leo> :)
[09:02] <eyalw> ?
[09:03] <kevin_> soundray: is it a free driver?
[09:03] <soundray> kevin_: yes, of course -- ext3 is GPL
[09:03] <npmccallum> anyone good with tape drives?
[09:03] <kevin_> i knew that (ahem)
[09:03] <bluefox83> people still use those old things? :O
[09:04] <Znortfl> bluefox83, its really dark out there let me get something to light
[09:04] <kevin_> they are good for big backups
[09:04] <bluefox83> ...
[09:04] <soundray> npmccallum: I'm really good at throwing them over long distances
[09:04] <npmccallum> soundray: lol, same here
[09:05] <Znortfl> bluefox83, I put the red wire in "Mic in" and the green wire in "Line in"
[09:06] <kevin_> soundray: it is showing that the drive is empty
[09:07] <soundray> kevin_: how did you check that?
[09:08] <chotchki> hey everyone im trying to get XGL/Beryl working in edgy but it seems that AIGLX keeps interfering with my effort
[09:08] <chotchki> ive tried disabling composite and AIGLX but nothing seems to work
[09:08] <kevin_> soundray: places>computer
[09:08] <kevin_> (gnome)
[09:08] <kevin_> the panel thingie
[09:08] <maccam94> i'm pretty sure i've seen a fix for this but can't remember it: all i get is a black screen when using the nvidia binary driver, any ideas? (nv driver works fine)
[09:09] <chotchki> im on the ati fglrx driver so i dont know for nvidia
[09:09] <soundray> kevin_: select Go-Location and type /mnt/
[09:09] <tonyyarusso> chotchki: Try in #ubuntu-xgl - that's where the shiny object folks hang out
[09:09] <chotchki> ah okay tonyyarusso, thanks
[09:09] <dsquare> I DIDN'T GET PHOTShop RUning!@ BUT I GOT IMAGEREADY WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE SAME WITH MORE FEATURES.. it is weird that imageready will run, but photoshop wont, though. I AM ON TEH PATH TO ARTS THANK YOU !!!! :D

[09:10] <soundray> kevin_: a menu command in nautilus
[09:10] <kevin_> soundray: nautulis?
[09:10] <soundray> kevin_: nautilus is the program that opens when you select Places-Computer
[09:10] <soundray> kevin_: probably says 'File Browser' in the title bar
[09:10] <gleesond> edgy used oss or alsa?
[09:10] <kevin_> ah
[09:10] <kevin_> thanks
[09:11] <kevin_> soundray: am I supposed to see something?
[09:11] <Jinkguns> dsquare: Gimp didn't suit you?
[09:12] <soundray> kevin_: if your drive is still mounted, yes
[09:12] <Jinkguns> <.<
[09:12] <olu> if i want to install xfce 4.4 rc2 from the installer do i have to remove the old xfce first?
[09:12] <dsquare> Jinkguns, i couldn't find instructions on installing gimpshop, i didn't like pixel, and i am a ten year photoshop vet.. if i could find instructions for installing gimpshop i would definitely give it a try.
[09:13] <kevin_> soundray: so if i'm not seeing anything, that's bad?
[09:13] <dsquare> i tried gimp but it is just not the same style. i will experiment with it more in the future no doubt but i need my photoshop for sure. nothing like it.
[09:13] <x-r00t-x> hey guys i need a telnet server
[09:13] <soundray> kevin_: probably not -- maybe you've unmounted the drive in the meantime
[09:13] <Jinkguns> Oh.
[09:13] <DARKGuy> Wtf! gaim has a block contact, but not an unblock contact one!
[09:13] <NoUse> !telnet
[09:13] <ubotu> telnet is not safe. Please use ssh instead. See !ssh
[09:13] <Jinkguns> Well Gimp is designed for multiple monitors.

[09:13] <kevin_> soundray: hmmmm.... that sounds serious
[09:13] <jose> hi all, i am getting this error when trying to run some programms, someone could help? gizmo: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2: undefined symbol: FT_Library_SetLcdFilter

[09:14] <dsquare> jinkguns, i will give that a try once i've got mine configured.. that is interesting. i have had some difficulty with my dual monitors.
[09:14] <utab_> I have upgraded to feisty but there are two problems I am experiencing everytime I open my computer I have do "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" and the second one the fonts are too small and the screen is not crystal clear a little blury
[09:14] <olu> anyone know if the xfce 4.4 rc2 is in the feisty repos?
[09:14] <kevin_> *cower
[09:14] <kevin_> soundray: nothing
[09:14] <Jinkguns> dsquare: Still having trouble with the dual monitors?
[09:14] <x-r00t-x> NoUse, is it not really safe?
[09:15] <soundray> kevin_: back in the terminal, run 'mount' and see if your NTFS partition is mounted on /mnt (or somewhere else)
[09:15] <NoUse> x-r00t-x very not safe, anythign you type over telnet, including passwords can be intercepted very easily
[09:15] <Dragutin00> how do i add dictionaries to the dictionary in applications -> accessories?
[09:15] <x-r00t-x> oh man :D
[09:15] <dsquare> lol yes jinkguns i am still i have tried bigdesktop and xinerama but only managed to delete my xorf.conf, i will give it another try very soon for sure.
[09:15] <DARKGuy> dsquare: what's the problem with dual monitors, anyways?
[09:16] <xXx> exit
[09:16] <x-r00t-x> NoUse, my isp has installed telnet :D i gonna give a try ;))
[09:16] <suacy> hey, i compiled a vanilla 2.6.19 kernel for dapper, I am planning to fresh install to edgy soon, would it be a good/bad idea to use that same kernel i compiled?
[09:16] <dsquare> darkguy, i don't know exactly i have just not been able to successfully run them.. i tried two walkthroughs, one from the wiki and one from the forum, but i am not nearly out of things to try.. i think i may have done something wrong on one of my attempts also.
[09:16] <kevin_> soundray: well, it shows the correct ammount of free space, but still no files
[09:17] <utab_> is there anyone who upgraded to feisty
[09:17] <Znortfl> I'll ask my question again. My microphone does not work. The channel is not muted. The wires are probably in the right plugs. Any suggestions?
[09:17] <DARKGuy> dsquare: I have a xorg.conf that might be useful for you... who knows
[09:17] <dsquare> dark ok ill msg u my email? i cant dcc i think
[09:17] <soundray> kevin_: but you saw files there before, didn't you?
[09:17] <kevin_> no
[09:17] <Jinkguns> dsquare: You should be able to configure your dual monitors in your xorg.conf without need of a additional program.
[09:18] <DARKGuy> dsquare: I'll just pastebin it
[09:18] <Jinkguns> dsquare: have you tried following a wiki guide?
[09:18] <utab_> Znortfl, search for settings on ALSA
[09:18] <dsquare> jinkguns ok thanks, i have tried a wiki but that is the one where i think i may have made a mistake.
[09:18] <suacy> Znortfl: try unmuting the "ADC" channel
[09:18] <dsquare> i have not worked with ".confs" or even ".inis" for years.
[09:18] <DARKGuy> Actually, wikis and howtos for dual monitors don't help much, a google search does it, but you've got to mix stuff from here and there, that's who I did it
[09:18] <dsquare> interesting
[09:19] <soundray> kevin_: it's very unlikely that you have changed any data on that partition accidentally, so I wouldn't worry, but check that you can still boot Windows from that drive.
[09:19] <soundray> kevin_: are you using NTFS compression?
[09:20] <kevin_> I don't think so, but maybe.
[09:20] <DARKGuy> dsquare: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35316/
[09:20] <kevin_> I have diskspace to burn, so I think i didn't enable it
[09:20] <dsquare> thanks darkguy
[09:20] <DARKGuy> dsquare: each device section has its matching screen and monitor section, and in serverlayout is where everything is set up
[09:20] <utab_> I have upgraded to feisty but there are two problems I am experiencing everytime I open my computer I have do "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" and the second one the fonts are too small and the screen is not crystal clear a little blury
[09:21] <kevin_> soundray: i'll check windows now, Thanks so muck for your help!
[09:21] <tonyyarusso> utab_: Feisty in #ubuntu+1
[09:21] <dsquare> ok. that sounds familiar from what i was working on with the wiki.
[09:21] <utab_> tonyyarusso, thx
[09:21] <DARKGuy> dsquare: welcome, don't mind the modelines, you just want the Screen 0/1 in Device sections and Xinerama "On" in the end of the ServerLayout section, I just don't use it but for enabling it that's how you have to do it
[09:21] <markus_> I need a command like > with the differens that it place the output first in the file and not last
[09:22] <DARKGuy> dsquare: For Xinerama, be sure to add the left screen first, then the left again but with LeftOf for the right screen, and then the right screen with LeftOf for the left screen (seeing the xorg file you'll understand better)
[09:22] <DARKGuy> dsquare: good luck :)
[09:22] <DARKGuy> I'm tempted to make a Dual Monitor howto... :3
[09:22] <soundray> markus_: man tac
[09:22] <dsquare> lol yah ok i think i will thanks for your tips and .conf  :)
[09:22] <DARKGuy> dsquare: welcome :)
[09:23] <Jinkguns> Would there be a way to rub Dreamweaver in Ubuntu?
=== inu|sleep is now known as inuyasharenegade
[09:23] <Jinkguns> Nvu is nice, but I'm looking for something to work with dreamweaver templates and auto-update links accross the website when changes are made
[09:24] <tonyyarusso> Jinkguns: Some of the older ones work in wine, but MX+ won't, iirc
[09:24] <Jinkguns> what about crossover office?
[09:24] <Dragutin00> how do i add available dictionaries to the dictionary in applications->accessories?
[09:25] <HpS> bonsoir
[09:25] <DARKGuy> soundray: because it's hard to make schools and such use Linux for arts teaching, for example, when they've been teaching Photoshop for years?
[09:25] <Jinkguns> soundray: If I can run ubuntu without using proprietary bloatware anywhere except dreamweaver, its better then running linux. :P
[09:26] <Jinkguns> better then running windows
[09:26] <Jinkguns> -_-;;
[09:26] <Dragutin00> =( nobody knows?
[09:26] <DARKGuy> Jinkguns: lol, nice
[09:26] <HpS> quelqu un peut il me renseigner svp??ou trouver le xgl paquet svp?
[09:26] <Znortfl> Ok now my microphone works, but I got this annoying high sound on the background, any tips for that?
[09:26] <Jinkguns> anyway
[09:27] <soundray> DARKGuy, Jinkguns: I say if you've understood the problems of proprietary systems, go all the way and throw off the shackles entirely
[09:27] <tonyyarusso> Jinkguns: no idea
[09:27] <bluefox83> hey is there a way to lock the screen with one key or something?
[09:27] <Dragutin00> znort- try turning down the input volume
[09:27] <Jinkguns> off to try to score a date with a graduate three years older then me on yahoo personals.
[09:27] <DARKGuy> soundray: it's hard :p
[09:27] <Jinkguns> soundray: Hi, I work at a office. Office would like me to do web development using dreamweaver templates. I want to use opensource as much as possible
[09:27] <Jinkguns> hence my dilemma
[09:28] <tonyyarusso> Jinkguns: silly office
[09:28] <Jinkguns> Heh
[09:28] <jof> hello
[09:28] <Jinkguns> at least I can use Ubuntu. ;)
[09:28] <Jinkguns> Anyway, I'm off. :D
[09:28] <Sniffy`> Hey guys, I'm new to Ubuntu and Linux in general so I'm sorry about the dumb question. How can I reduce the visual size of shortcuts on my desktop, apart from increasing my resolution?
[09:29] <jof> i use kubuntu
[09:29] <soundray> Jinkguns: so you subordinate your wish to run free software to the wishes of your employer. That's fine, but be clear about the fact that it's still you making that choice
[09:29] <Jinkguns> sniffy, right click on the icon, and select resize
[09:29] <Jinkguns> and click the box that appears in the corner, drag towards the center
[09:29] <Sniffy`> Damn how did I miss that :( Thanks
[09:29] <Jinkguns> n p
[09:29] <suacy> i compiled 2.6.19 from kernel.org under dapper, when do a fresh install of edgy on the same machine later, can/should i use this same kernel?
[09:29] <VigoFusion> Whee,,its fun learning new stuff
[09:30] <Jinkguns> soundray: I don't trust myself with Nvu, I'm not a educated web developer. ;0
[09:30] <bluefox83> suacy, why in the hell did you compile a kernel?
[09:30] <suacy> bluefox83: for fun and profit
[09:30] <bluefox83> suacy, profit? how so?
[09:31] <soundray> suacy: I don't think there's a risk in trying it. Keep the stock edgy kernel handy in case it doesn't work, and be ready to recompile if need be.
[09:31] <felixjet> can i view from a windows pc the content of a ubuntu shared folder?
[09:31] <soundray> felixjet: yes. You need samba on Ubuntu
[09:31] <bluefox83> felixjet, if you have the right software installed...
[09:31] <soundray> !samba | felixjet
[09:31] <ubotu> felixjet: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[09:31] <bluefox83> yeah, what soundray said
[09:31] <Sniffy`> Jinkguns, is there any way to apply a size to all icons on your desktop now and in the future?
[09:32] <suacy> bluefox83: well, mostly for fun and the learning experience. as nerdy as it is, when i was young, my father would compile a custom kernel on my machine while i watched.
[09:32] <suacy> so now it's like a trial of manhood
[09:32] <bluefox83> suacy, wow...
[09:32] <bluefox83> that must have been so boring as a kid >.>
[09:32] <maccam94> i'm pretty sure i've seen a fix for this but can't remember it: all i get is a black screen when using the nvidia binary driver, any ideas?
[09:32] <soundray> suacy: that's the attitude ;)
[09:33] <bluefox83> maccam94, did you change the driver listed in xorf.conf? and if so, are you using a resolution the driver can use?
[09:33] <bluefox83> er
[09:33] <bluefox83> *xorg.conf
[09:33] <suacy> when i was in high school, i wanted a windows machine to play games on. i think my father felt betrayed
[09:33] <bluefox83> sorry finger has a bandaid on it from giving blood today >.>
[09:34] <bluefox83> suacy, shame on you!
[09:34] <Byan> hey where is openssl installed?
[09:34] <suacy> i was an ungrateful child with unsavory friends =(
[09:34] <bluefox83> awww
[09:34] <soundray> suacy: I had that conflict with my son for a while. Now he's happy with Linux games :)
[09:34] <conn> hi, what's the proper name of the gnome theme preferences dialogue that comes default with ubuntu? I'm using kubuntu and I want to selectively install it, but I don't know the name... please help
[09:34] <soundray> or pretends to be
[09:34] <VigoFusion> My granpaw threw me off a Trawler into the Gulf so I would learn to swim, I do not approve of that method, but I can sure swim. Old school teaching can seem traumatic, but its fun in retrospect.
[09:34] <felixjet> soundray: ya i know about samba, but what application i need on windows to read the linux folders? samba for w32? xD
[09:35] <bluefox83> conn, i believe the package you need is gnome-themes
[09:35] <cpk1> is there a link to creating your own .debs from source?
[09:35] <soundray> felixjet: no, just the network neighborhood thingy
[09:35] <suacy> i am extremely excited with the state of linux gaming: one day i am going to send a thank-you letter to id software and the makers of SDL
[09:35] <bluefox83> cpk1, whatcha making into a .deb?
[09:36] <soundray> conn: it's called gnome-theme-manager, and it's in the gnome-control-center package
[09:36] <raja_> how do you set time from command line
[09:36] <cpk1> bluefox83: well the newest amarok for one and several other things probably, I dont really feel like upgrading to edgy
[09:36] <VigoFusion> saucy: The future is now, send the letter.
[09:36] <tonyyarusso> raja_: ntpdate will sync it to a time server
[09:36] <bluefox83> suacy, i'm loving that game companies are keeping the linux community in their scope now..and i'll be so happeh when they all realise that the only thing keeping people in windows, is games...
[09:36] <soundray> raja_: 'sudo /etc/network/if-up.d/ntpdate'
[09:36] <bluefox83> cpk1, and what..downloading the .deb from their website was too hard?
[09:37] <raja_> soundray: yeah but the timezone is wrong
[09:37] <soundray> raja_: correct it with 'sudo tzconfig'
[09:37] <bluefox83> why would anyone that's not a developer compile anything from source when using ubuntu >.>
[09:38] <soundray> raja_: and make sure the UTC setting in /etc/default/rcS is what you want.
[09:38] <bluefox83> especially when the packages are available >.>
[09:38] <DARKGuy> bluefox83: compiling from source sucks :(
[09:38] <raja_> beauty, thanks soundray
[09:38] <bluefox83> DARKGuy, i concur
[09:38] <DARKGuy> bluefox83: yay, someone agrees
[09:38] <bluefox83> total agreement >.>
[09:38] <borg> is there a DivX5 codec in ubuntu?
[09:39] <conn> soundray: cheers, that was the package I needed
[09:39] <bluefox83> i mean, it's not hard..but why in the name of the goddess would you sit through that when you can download and install in 1/100th the time? >.>
[09:39] <cpk1> bluefox83: so, I wanted the latest version, there isnt a dapper .deb for the latest version
[09:39] <DARKGuy> bluefox83: yeah :(
[09:39] <cpk1> contrary to popular belief I am not an idiot
[09:39] <imperior> do you recomend sth like total commander for ubuntu?
[09:39] <Byan> o.o
[09:40] <VigoFusion> There was never any doubt
[09:40] <soundray> bluefox83: to have a CPU-optimized version that saves you .01 seconds on each run ;)
[09:40] <carld> sed seems to be for find/replace onoly, I want to use a regexp to find and output, what program should I use?
[09:40] <bluefox83> cpk1, try the edgy package?
[09:40] <VigoFusion> :)
[09:40] <Imrahil> man I just got a new laptop from dell, hot little number w/ core 2 7200 /2 gb/ 100gb 7200/ etc etc. the glossy screen is going to take some getting used to!
[09:40] <suacy> bluefox83: there is a big rush from compiling something from soruce
[09:40] <dee> hello. could someone post the regex for [attachment:*deb]  ?
[09:40] <suacy> bluefox83: i feel drunk with power afterwards
[09:40] <bluefox83> suacy, oh BS, i've used mandrake, debian, and libranet...and it's boooring
[09:41] <Imrahil> do people here have strong preferences for glossy or matte screens?
[09:41] <Znortfl> guys I am talking on TeamSpeak and I get this annoying eeeeeewb sound after me. Anybody got a suggestion how to fix it
[09:41] <mlehrer> is it possible to get support for more advanced wifi encryption like WPA
[09:41] <VigoFusion> <is perhaps the oldest newb dumcluck on record, and proud to learn.
[09:41] <mlehrer> ubuntu seems to only have the basic WEP
[09:41] <BSDnux> i can't get my line-in to work... watching tele without sound is not fun
[09:41] <soundray> Imrahil: glossy for darkened rooms, matte for office lighting
[09:41] <mlehrer> but can't even support no authentication
[09:41] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: Try network manager for ease, although it still needs work imo
[09:41] <bluefox83> BSDnux, it's not muted is it?
[09:42] <BSDnux> at least that's what alsamixer, gnome-mixer et all say
[09:43] <dizzie> Compile 2.6.18 on a 50Mhz (68030/50) Amiga, time = ? (taking bets :p)
[09:43] <soundray> dizzie: ~4-5 days
[09:43] <BSDnux> funny thing is that xfce4-mixer does show a muted "invol" and always has mic selected as input source instead of "line"... and i can't change it there because it always jumps back. and in tvtime i have volume 0 and can't change it at all
[09:43] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: is that different from the network settings dialog that comes with edgy?
[09:44] <dizzie> Nah, took 40-50 hrs~ on my P120 :p
[09:44] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: Yes.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager has more info
[09:44] <Byan> /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.0.3/../../../../lib64/crt1.o: In function `_start':../sysdeps/x86_64/elf/start.S:109: undefined reference to `main'
[09:44] <Byan> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
[09:44] <Byan> =/
[09:44] <Byan> wtf
[09:44] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: cool i'm installing network-manager-gnome right now
[09:45] <soundray> dizzie: I don't think it'll take much longer if you compile a minimal kernel as appropriate for that machine
[09:45] <Pie-rate> How do I make a fake cd drive in wine with an iso? I mounted it and set it up as a drive in winecfg, but the game i'm trying to run with it still says game cd not in drive
[09:46] <DARKGuy> w/ 4
[09:46] <DARKGuy> oops
[09:46] <felixjet> Pie-rate: go #winehq they should know more than us about wine
[09:47] <Pie-rate> yeah i sent the same message there, place is pretty dead
[09:47] <felixjet> yep
[09:47] <suacy> DARKGuy: did you mount the iso?
[09:47] <maxxism> hey all.
[09:48] <kitche> Pie-rate: the error is due to the protection the game cd has on it doesn't really deal with wine
[09:48] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: how do i configure the network manager?  the nm applet is running but doesn't have a lot of options
[09:48] <dcordes> hello all
[09:50] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: Once you've commented things in /etc/network/interfaces you just tell it to connect to ones you want
[09:50] <maxxism> I am trying to move my /home to another partition.  I have copied all the data over to the new partition,  but cant seem to mount add a mount point in gparted.  do I have to add this manually to the fstab?  fstab looks alot different than it used to.  it has UID stuff in there I have no idea how to deal with.....
[09:50] <toM|vendettA> Can anyone tell us where I can find mouse drivers for my microsoft mouse (yeah I know its practically an oxymoron :P), and for my logitech webcam
[09:51] <soundray> maxxism: the UUID stuff will make more sense if you take a look at the contents of /dev/disks/
[09:52] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: why would you want a driver for your mouse o_O? the logitech webcams are in the kernel afaik
[09:52] <tonyyarusso> !webcam | toM|vendettA
[09:52] <ubotu> toM|vendettA: webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[09:52] <tonyyarusso> perhaps
[09:52] <kitche> toM|vendettA: you don't need drivers for the microsoft mouse you will just have to configure it correctly in xorg.conf
[09:52] <soundray> maxxism: if all else fails, you can use the old way, too
[09:53] <maxxism> soundray I am in there now.  I see the UUID stuff.
[09:53] <maxxism> soundray my partition is listed.  can i just add that to fstab?
[09:54] <Sniffy`> I've got another noob question. Under Applications -> Systems tools, will the "3rd party package remover" only appear when there is actually a package to remove?
[09:54] <soundray> maxxism: yes, sure
[09:54] <adaminla> Hope this isn't too far off topic, but does anyone know if a HP 5440 will print photos and Gimp files "out of the box"?
[09:54] <toM|vendettA> i am interested in drivers for my mouse cause it has two buttons on the left and the right, that let you move your internet browser back and forward. and also when I click mouse 3 (scroll-wheel click) it doesnt bring up the arrow scrolling, I miss that functionality =\
[09:54] <budluva> anyone know when ubuntu will support blu-ray burners?
[09:54] <soundray> adaminla: not off the top of my head, but check the printer database at linuxprinting.org
[09:55] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: scroll up and see what kitche said
[09:55] <derFlo> i dont want to set rights on public_html folder all the time i create a new file... is there any possibility?
[09:55] <blaa> nol
[09:55] <svip> Why can't two application have access to the sound device at the same time like on Slack?
[09:55] <maxxism> soundray this is perfect thank you.  I got it now.
[09:55] <adaminla> ok, thanks
[09:55] <soundray> maxxism: you're easy to support ;)
[09:56] <asgilder> How do I install tarballs?
[09:56] <svip> "Install"?
[09:56] <soundray> asgilder: avoid it. Try to find a .deb first
[09:56] <maxxism> soundray thanx,  nice to hear that.
[09:56] <kevin_> soundray: are you still there?
[09:56] <toM|vendettA> im a newbie, should I edit xorg.conf with gedit, or what exactly is it?
[09:56] <soundray> kevin_: yes, but not for long ;)
[09:56] <kapputu> can someone confirm if madwifi support is broken for Atheros cards in Edgy?
[09:57] <asgilder> Still trying to install firefox; It doesn't have a .deb. Just tarballs and pkgadds.
[09:57] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: you should ask the wiki on it
[09:57] <maxxism> soundray this partition should have the same flags as /  right?
[09:57] <maccam94> bluefox83: sorry about the long response, yes the nvidia driver is set and the resolutions are fine. when running X it just makes the screen go black, and only by going into rescue mode and changing the "nvidia" to "nv" in xorg.conf can I get any picture at all.
[09:57] <kitche> toM|vendettA: do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is the easiest way but you will have to restart X for your new settings to be set
[09:57] <kevin_> soundray: it worked!
[09:57] <soundray> kevin_: well done
[09:57] <soundray> maxxism: no...
[09:57] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[09:57] <Oolo2> does anyone else have aproblem with wine in edgy... it says the x11 driver is not found
[09:58] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: but backup before you try editing it
[09:58] <maxxism> soundray  this is what I added UUID=41740dd7-3277-49da-9130-e3f03d1ace11 /home ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1
[09:58] <toM|vendettA> whose method is the easiest? yours or dcordes, and what exactly am I looking to edit
[09:58] <kevin_> soundray: if i make a new partition, will it be labeled as hda2?
=== x-r00t-x is now known as x-r00t-x-sleepz
[09:58] <soundray> maxxism: usually data partitions have '0 2' while root has '0 1', but don't ask me what it means
[09:58] <soundray> kevin_: if you make a primary one, yes.
[09:58] <maxxism> soundray ok thanx I will try it.
[09:59] <soundray> maxxism: I'd leave out the errors= option as well
[09:59] <x-r00t-x-sleepz> hey how do i install kde desktop?
[09:59] <maxxism> soundray thanx
[09:59] <asgilder> So, if I can't find a deb, how do I install?
[09:59] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: do what kitche said. and we both told you the actual commands you have to paste in order to do each method
[09:59] <kevin_> soundray: I can have multiple primary partitions on one drive
[09:59] <tonyyarusso> x-r00t-x-sleepz: install kubuntu-desktop
[09:59] <x-r00t-x-sleepz> apt-get install kde-desktop
[10:00] <x-r00t-x-sleepz> tonyyarusso, i dont have 12 day to download whole cd
[10:00] <soundray> asgilder: you can install firefox from the ubuntu repositories. Spend some time with the docs on how software is managed on ubuntu:
[10:00] <toM|vendettA> dcordes, im asking cause you guys told me two different commands, do they both do the same thing?
[10:00] <soundray> !software | asgilder
[10:00] <ubotu> asgilder: A general introduction to the ways software can be installed, removed and managed in Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoftwareManagement - See also !Packages and !Equivalents

[10:00] <x-r00t-x-sleepz> !kde
[10:00] <ubotu> KDE (http://kde.org) is the K Desktop Environment. To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop", or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE for other ways to get KDE
[10:00] <tonyyarusso> x-r00t-x-sleepz: You don't need a CD
[10:00] <str4> sup
[10:00] <maelvino> sup
[10:00] <kanedaddy> hey
[10:00] <Pntkl> sup?
[10:00] <kevin_> sup?
[10:00] <x-r00t-x-sleepz> hmm got it
[10:00] <soundray> maxxism: that's equivalent to my /home entry in fstab
[10:00] <maxxism> soundray beauty thanx
[10:01] <eltese> hey! someone helped me set up my box as a nat yesterday, im sorry i forgot your name,, but now i cant reach my nat box from my other computer but my nat box can reach the other.. help?
[10:01] <maxxism> be back
[10:01] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" after you finished you will have to log out and login again for the changes to take effect. to do this real quick you can press <ctrl>+<alt>+<backspace>
[10:01] <x-r00t-x-sleepz> tonyyarusso, how big is it ?
[10:01] <asgilder> I typed !software, it just said event not found.
[10:01] <Pntkl> you tell me
[10:01] <abuyazan> hello
[10:01] <maelvino> ??
[10:01] <str4> interest
[10:01] <kanedaddy> I'll find out
[10:01] <tonyyarusso> x-r00t-x-sleepz: Beats me
[10:01] <x-r00t-x-sleepz> 400mb? tonyyarusso ?
[10:01] <tonyyarusso> x-r00t-x-sleepz: apt will tell you
[10:01] <eltese> con-man, did u get it working yesterday //mbd?
[10:02] <soundray> asgilder: scroll up and read the line from ubotu
[10:02] <soundray> !software > asgilder
[10:02] <dcordes> toM|vendettA: actually they do the same thing. the only difference is that with gedit you have to type the things in yourself and dpkg-reconfigure xorg.conf asks you what you want with a small gui
[10:02] <soundray> asgilder: you should also have it as a pm now.
[10:02] <Oolo2> can anyone tell me how to reinstall the x11 driver
[10:02] <abuyazan> i am using my headphones on my laptop but when i insert the headphone in it the sound still comes out from both the laptop speakers and the headphone
[10:02] <abuyazan> did anyone have an idea
[10:03] <soundray> abuyazan: that's a hardware issue.
[10:03] <tonyyarusso> abuyazan: hardware?
[10:03] <abuyazan> what do you mean by hardware , which hardware
[10:03] <abuyazan> ?
[10:03] <kevin_> bye!
[10:03] <Oolo2> bye
[10:04] <abuyazan> and it was working fine when i was using suse with KDE
[10:04] <Oolo2> can anyone tell me how to reinstall the x11 driver
[10:04] <tonyyarusso> abuyazan: I mean it's a problem with the actual circuitry/soldering/screws in your machine.  Most likely jostled loose recently.  Try a SUSE live CD if you want to confirm that.  Headphone jacks have a physical circuit switch usually.
[10:05] <blazemonger>  what'sup folks
[10:06] <maxxism> soundray thats great it worked awesome.  I now have 240GB in my home folder.  much better than 3
[10:07] <abuyazan> tonyyarusso,
[10:07] <abuyazan> tonyyarusso,  when i was on suse KDE it was fine before that i had Debian with Gnome it is the same problem
[10:08] <cberlo> Hi folks!  Can anyone suggest why setting my wireless card to Master mode no longer works in Edgy?
[10:08] <tonyyarusso> abuyazan: Then you have a very, very bizarre headphone jack.
[10:09] <cberlo> Using a D-Lin 650, an ipw2200 and an ath_pci card all give the same response:  Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06)
[10:09] <cberlo> d-link, that is.
[10:10] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: nm_applet just says "No network connect" - how do i bring up a wireless configuration dialog?
[10:10] <mlehrer> connection even
[10:10] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: If it's handling your interface, it will show anything available.  Maybe do a 'sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart' if it's not seeing them yet.
[10:11] <DougGSM> et
[10:11] <keeganX> Does anyone know where amarok icons are stored at?
[10:11] <keeganX> Or where kde applications are stored in general
[10:12] <abuyazan> tonyyarusso,  may be, thank you
[10:12] <shinda> hey, just switched yesterday for the first time to ubuntu and was wondering if anyone could help me understand what the different sessions are about
[10:12] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: how do i tell it to handle an interface?  the docs said to remove from /etc/network/interfaces and network manager would magically start managing
[10:13] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: Correct
[10:13] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: the applet only wants to list networks that are already working
[10:13] <Limulf> My O.S. is Ubuntu 6.10. I'm trying to do the tutorial about OpenOffice Base. My problem is that when I try to launch the Form Wizard, an empty OpenOffice Writer window opens. The blue bar which appears at the bottom when OpenOffice is loading a new document is frozen at its mid, and no wizard is on the screen :-/ Any ideas? Is this happening to other people using Edgy? Thanks for your time.
[10:13] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: making it useless to set up a new one
[10:13] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: i must be missing something
[10:13] <jerp> shinda, you can add KDE, Gnome, or Xfce desktop interfaces
[10:13] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: Right click doesn't show any?
[10:13] <jerp> plus a couple others
[10:13] <zspada15> !undervolt
[10:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about undervolt - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:13] <keeganX> Does anyone know where KDE Apps are stored in Ubuntu?
[10:14] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: right click has 2 options: enable networking (checked) and connection information (greyed out)
[10:14] <_coolNICKhere> HOKAY, SO: I try to mount the drive, and nothing but this happens: "mount: special device dev/hdb1 does not exist"
[10:14] <olu> anyone know where the listen icon is stored?
[10:14] <_coolNICKhere> why?
[10:14] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: the about says "NetworkManager Applet 0.6.3"
[10:14] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: the wireless is eth1
[10:14] <toM|vendettA> http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/ <-- I'm trying to download those drivers for my webcam but i dont know what to do, can anyone help?
[10:14] <shinda> jerp. so the different sessions are like the different desktop skins?
[10:15] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: Maybe a bug?  Reboot?
[10:15] <jerp> basicly yeah
[10:15] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: dev/hdb1 won't exist should be /dev/hdb1 unless you miss-typed
[10:15] <jerp> plus different session arrangements too
[10:15] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: i'll keep playing, just wanted to make sure i was using the right applet.  thanks
[10:15] <jerp> as the name would imply
[10:15] <borg> is there a DivX5 codec in ubuntu?
[10:15] <_coolNICKhere> ah
[10:15] <Cat2> I added the Xfce desktop, but it doesn't seem any faster than Gnome. It did install some more lightwieght apps like Abiword, but if I wanted to use that I could have installed that from Gnome.
[10:16] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: thanks
[10:16] <jerp> sessions are found in the System/preferences menu
[10:16] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: Couldn't mount device '/dev/hdb1': Invalid argument
[10:16] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: is that bad?
[10:16] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: how are you trying to mount it?
[10:17] <shinda> jerp. thanks, what would be the best windows comparison to sessions?
[10:17] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: with the command line
[10:17] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: sudo ntfsmount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
[10:17] <keeganX> Does anyone know where Gnome stores KDE icons?
[10:17] <borg> where can i find DivX codec for ubuntu?
[10:17] <blazemonger> thanks to those who helped me with the screensaver prob last night
[10:18] <ezenu> Anyone have experience with VMWare server? It keeps creating an empty directory in my home dir called 'vmware'.. I'd prefer it not to do this if it isn't even going to put anything in there
[10:18] <maxxism> borg install VLC and it should be able to no problem view divx
[10:18] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: you should not mount anything to /mnt anyways it's mount ntfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/<folder> unless your using ntfs-3g then replace ntfs with ntfs-3g
[10:18] <borg> maxxism, even DivX 5 ?
[10:18] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: i'll try that, thanks
[10:18] <abuyazan> tonyyarusso, i got the problem
[10:18] <tonyyarusso> cool
[10:18] <maxxism> borg I am sure.  I normally grab xvids so I am not 100%
[10:18] <sun_> hi how to capture from camcorder and create a dvd which i can play in a normal dvd player?
[10:19] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: sudo: ntfs-3gmount: command not found
[10:19] <jerp> I'm not exactly sure about that, I haven't been using windows for over a year now and have forgotten,  I guess the different servers available vesus a normal everyday desktop.
[10:19] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: mount ntfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/<folder not sure where your getting the mount in the filesystem
[10:20] <sun_> hi how to capture from camcorder and create a dvd which i can play in a normal dvd player?
[10:20] <abuyazan> tonyyarusso, when i opened volume icon and choose switches there is option called headphone jack sense it wasnt checked
[10:20] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: heh reboot didn't seem to help
[10:20] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: I'm lost.
[10:20] <Lynoure> ezenu: it might possibly store the snapshots there. But I do not know for sure and do not at the moment have vmware installed. If no one gives you a good answer, email them and ask. Companies usually answer questions about their products.
[10:20] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: blegh
[10:20] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: you don't type in ntfs-3gmount it's just ntfs-3g
[10:20] <_coolNICKhere> oh
[10:20] <mlehrer> this almost seems like the wrong applet
[10:21] <_coolNICKhere> thanks
[10:21] <asgilder> To build a .mozconfig file, I just open a text editor, write the file, and save, right?
[10:21] <tonyyarusso> mlehrer: sure you followed the wiki instructions right?  See also !wifi perhaps
[10:21] <ezenu> Lynoure, ok, thanks
[10:21] <sun_> hi how to capture from camcorder and create a dvd which i can play in a normal dvd player?
[10:21] <kitche> asgilder: yes
[10:21] <mlehrer> tonyyarusso: it is just a fresh edgy install
[10:21] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: The device '/dev/hdb1' doesn't have a valid NTFS. Maybe you selected the wrong device? Or the whole disk instead of a partition (e.g. /dev/hda, not /dev/hda1)? Or the other way around?
[10:21] <shinda> all right gotcha, main reason I'm asking is because I was looking at different ways to make my os really stand out graphically, I wanted to get XGL installed but don't got the specs for it so tried enlightenment
[10:21] <Cyllene> Hey all. I am trying to get opera's flash plugin to play sound while I have XXMS running, but it is failing horribly.
[10:22] <mlehrer> i haven't done anything else except remove eth1 from the /etc/network/interfaces
[10:22] <Cyllene> I've enabled esd and changed asound.conf, but it isn't working.
[10:22] <Cyllene> Anyone know what is wrong?
[10:22] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: try it with ntfs but sounds like to me that hard drive filesystem is broken
[10:23] <liquid7> Hallo, wo bin ich denn hier gelandet ? :D
[10:23] <_coolNICKhere> Kitche: what does it mean by valid ntfs?

[10:24] <jerp> jared, ubuntu lite ???
[10:25] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: that its looking for ntfs filesystem which your disk probably doesn't have or the filesystem is messed up
[10:25] <jared_> What is ubuntu lite, never heard of it...i'm just talking about windows managers
[10:25] <WillySilly2> sod75: does that inclde where to set an http proxy?

[10:28] <abuyazan> when i open synaptic it gives me that there are broken packages by filter i found libfontconfig1 and gprayer
[10:28] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: did it say invalid permissions?
[10:28] <abuyazan> how could i fix this
[10:28] <sod75> WillySilly2: afaik there is no systemwide setting for a proxy, but you GUI (kde or gnome) does, try system settings/network settings
[10:28] <ehazlett> @_coolNICKhere: make sure it's unmounted
[10:28] <jda12> jerp, is ubuntu lite basiclly the same?
[10:28] <p33k4y> i disabled access to system tools, but no password is prompted when i try to run them, it jst says i cant access them

[10:29] <_coolNICKhere> kitche: it said command not found
[10:29] <p33k4y> !sudo
[10:29] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.

[10:30] <torpedo|dog> eltese: open a terminal and type "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[10:30] <kitche> _coolNICKhere: you have to use sudo

[10:30] <ehazlett> ...if so run "sudo umount /dev/hdb1"
[10:30] <Chewy954> is there a way without using a windows emulator other than wine?

[10:39] <mmxbass> as long as i'm at it, could i just rename ALL of the drives under computer/ by briefly just adding myself to the root group, rename, and tame myself out of root group?
[10:39] <tonyyarusso> fireflame: I have a Linksys WRT54GL, with DD-WRT firmware.
[10:39] <torpedo|dog> eltese: I would suggest that you do a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and then go through each section and hit enter, but I'm not sure if you've done any manual editing of that file to install a new video driver or something.
[10:39] <kitche> Cyllene: that looks correct to me

[11:36] <lee2> rubi1, which build do i need
[11:36] <rubi1> lee2: your trying to get one for amd processor architecture
[11:37] <zspada15> lee2, i386
[11:37] <tormod> lee2: intel is not amd, right?
[11:37] <lee2> surely all 64bit cpu's must follow generic structure if they both run Windows ?
[11:37] <rubi1> lee2: i would look but i can only run one x app at a time
[11:37] <lee2> i386 is 32bit ?
[11:37] <Chris_Sutcliff> rubi1: i may be wrong but afaik amd64 is for amd64 and emt64 as they are essentially the same thing but different names
[11:37] <kitche> lee2: i386 is 32bit
[11:37] <SGersho1> Sorry - disconected

[11:38] <Cat2> here is something I have been wondering about: what is the advantage of using Ubuntu over just using the Debian distro itself? since Ubuntu is based on Debian, why not jsut use Debian in the first place? Is it because Ubuntu is more newbie friendly than Debian?
[11:38] <rubi1> is there a workaround for the installer via booting from a floppy
[11:38] <kitche> lee2: XP 64bit is just a windows 2003 kernel and that's it

[11:39] <Chris_Sutcliff> http://pastebin.co.uk/7100
[11:39] <kitche> lee2: why would it when they are made by the same company but anyways you want the amd64 iso if you want x86_64
[11:40] <Lynoure> rubi1: I've found stable Debian release very stable. You haven't? They just do not come out often.
[11:40] <bimberi> !debian | Cat2
[11:40] <ubotu> Cat2: Debian is "the rock upon which Ubuntu is founded". To see more details on the relationship, see: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship
[11:40] <tonyyarusso> Cat2: For many people, it boils down to the release cycle / newer applications, but largely it's a personal preference thing, like most.  Probably to #ubuntu-offtopic on this though.
[11:40] <zspada15> Chris_Sutcliff, try sudo apt-get install linux-headers

[11:40] <Chris_Sutcliff> im using my own kernel and i have the headers installed
[11:40] <SGersho1> And, chongbook, yes it was this option. The flicker was a visual beep.
[11:40] <Rontana> whats the name of the partitioner in the installer (text mode/sever) and can you run it again once you have got the system isntalled
[11:40] <Rontana> ?
[11:40] <dv_> Cat2, basically, if you want a cutting-edge desktop, you have to tweak a lot in debian

[11:40] <Cat2> thanks guys, that's what I thought, but in the Debian forums that i read one of the regular posters there saying that he didn't understand why anyoune would want to use Ubuntu, but maybe he was being a snob :-)

[11:41] <kybuz> 2 valmerco
[11:42] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: if you want 64bit yes

[11:42] <kybuz> 2 valmerco  i use vlc and mplayer

[11:42] <lee2> then why is the build called "AMD"
[11:42] <Cat2> thanks for offtopic, i didn't know about that channel
[11:42] <Valmarko> mplayer. but where do I get plugins? :)
[11:42] <rubi1> because its for amd processors lee2
[11:42] <kybuz> go 2 synaptic
[11:42] <lee2> i have an intel 64bit though
[11:42] <kitche> lee2: amd came out first with x86_64 so people call it that
[11:42] <kybuz> search vlc or mplayer
[11:42] <zspada15> !amd64
[11:42] <ubotu> AMD64 and EMT64 are fully supported architectures on Ubuntu. See http://tinyurl.com/jv6tc for more information.

[11:43] <jughead> there are 2 kinds of 64 bit

[11:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about d-link - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:43] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: because amd invented 86_x64, and intel just copied it and changed its name
[11:43] <lee2> chris, lol
[11:43] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: so its named after amd's version (the original)
[11:43] <kitche> lee2: EMT64 is a memory chip on Intel's processors that make them x86_64
[11:43] <maxsoft2> !dlink

[11:43] <Kirby904> Question = Is it possible in any way to run .exe's on linux
[11:43] <lee2> i thought INTEL was the best cpu to get
[11:44] <zspada15> Kirby904, sudo apt-get install wine
[11:44] <Kirby904> Any linux, not just ubuntu
[11:44] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: it depends
[11:44] <lee2> i was happy with my Athlon 2800...
[11:44] <kitche> Kirby904: wine
[11:44] <lee2> then i wanted to blow lots of money on a new pc
[11:44] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: i prefer amd, but many people prefer intel
[11:44] <rubi1> so there is no workaround from the graphical installer of 6.10?
[11:44] <lee2> NO i hate Intel now
[11:44] <kitche> lee2: Intels are for office work mostly while amd is for gaming
[11:44] <lee2> kitche, im a directx programmer :)
[11:44] <jughead> kitche, intel took the gaming crown back
[11:44] <rubi1> well, other than the alternate version
[11:44] <Kirby904> ya im testing it
[11:44] <SGersho1> lee2, I prefer Intel. Have used many versions of chips by both.
[11:44] <lee2> gpu is all i care about :P
[11:45] <jerp> Kirby904, if you're talking about Window's .exes, do you know about Wine?
[11:45] <lee2> its strange, my Athlon 2800 seems to perform better then my Intel
[11:45] <Kirby904> ill try Wine...
[11:45] <kitche> jughead: doesn't mean that's what they are made for though
[11:45] <zspada15> !wine | Kirby904
[11:45] <ubotu> Kirby904: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[11:45] <Micksa> okay
[11:45] <Kirby904> its for a program that windows rejects ... its an exe though
[11:45] <lee2> but my intel is only 2.13mhz x2.
[11:45] <Micksa> in dapper, how do I disable the hdd spindown on a laptop?
[11:45] <richard__> does anyone know how to force wine to run a program in windowed mode (like a really simple flag? :) )
[11:45] <jughead> i thought the core2 line was aimed at taking amd down
[11:46] <goose> i upgraded from dapper to edgy but the 'show updates' function doesn't work
[11:46] <lee2> jughead, ive always bought AMD cpu's till now, and ive regreted buying this damn intel cpu ever since
[11:46] <Kirby904> it was made for testing, but contains so called "malcious code", so windows rejects it -.-, wanted to see if it worked on linux
[11:46] <SGersho1> And Intel was always better even for games. And keep cooler.
[11:46] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: before they stole 86_x64 intels version of 64bit (IA64) was ONLY 64-bit, no 32-bit compatability.
[11:46] <TheDebugger> Anyway.. fanaticism is stupid, i take the best.. that's it
[11:46] <jerp> last one I heard of was they have a quad core out
[11:46] <rubi1> is there another irc channel for ubuntu support?
[11:46] <lee2> AMD seems to work harder per cycle then Intel
[11:47] <zspada15> !m$
[11:47] <Chris_Sutcliff> sgersho1: intel & cooler, must be an oxymoron
[11:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about m$ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[11:47] <lee2> if i have 2gb of ram, do i still need a swap partition ?
[11:47] <keith> I've loaded it, but it keeps suspending me
[11:47] <kitche> keith yes probably many have used gaim
[11:47] <maxsoft2> kitche: thank you very much.
[11:47] <Kirby904> after i install wine, where should it be?
[11:47] <kitche> lee2: not really
[11:48] <SGersho1> TheDebugger: We use(d) a Core Duo with Hyperthreading at work. It was a very good system. (We had a Giga of RAM, also).
[11:48] <Kirby904> also, i would like to know if i can access a MS-SQL server from ubuntu while im here
[11:48] <lee2> windows insists on a pagefile even though i turnt it off, stupid windows
[11:48] <zspada15> Kirby904, read the FAQ
[11:48] <keith> Kitche, Is there something better to use?
[11:48] <rubi1> Kyral Kyynara thank you for answering me
[11:48] <kitche> keith: not really ther is other programs out there but not like gaim
[11:48] <lee2> kitche, swapdisk is linux's "pagefile" right ?
[11:48] <rubi1> perhaps i shall try a full hdd wipe...that might be easier
[11:48] <reddragon3668> when you install software, where are the binaries stored on the system?
[11:48] <Byan> configure: WARNING: **** apxs was not found, DSO compilation will not be available
[11:48] <Byan> where is apxs?
[11:48] <kitche> lee2: pretty much you can also make a swapfile
[11:48] <zspada15> !DSO
[11:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about DSO - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:49] <lee2> kitche, why does the swapdisk do. ?
[11:49] <asgilder> Configure: error: *** uuid library (libuuid) not found?
[11:49] <lee2> when mem runs out, it uses swapdisk ?
[11:49] <kitche> lee2: it's virtual ram
[11:49] <keith> Kitche, I'm a bit new to linux, do you know what I have to do to get it working?
[11:49] <lee2> kitche, oh right.
[11:49] <zspada15> keith, what do you mean "get it working"
[11:49] <lee2> how big should i make my swap, i got 512gb gd
[11:49] <kitche> keith: you installed gaim what are you trying to use?
[11:49] <SGersho1> keith, are you on Linux now?
[11:49] <lee2> hd *
[11:49] <Byan> >_<
[11:49] <keith> Kitche, how to unsuspend my account??
[11:50] <kitche> lee2: if you have 2 gigs of ram no use in swap
[11:50] <keith> SGershol, yes I am
[11:50] <SGersho1> keith: seems it's working ;)
[11:50] <kitche> keith: by unsuspend do you mean login?
[11:50] <lee2> ok, i hope linux makes use of it :), XP only seems to use 700mb, then uses its stupid pagefile
[11:50] <goose> i upgraded from ubuntu dapper to edgy but the 'show updates' function doesn't work it does nothing. any ideas?
[11:50] <kitche> lee2: well windows needs an extra thing to use 2 gigs of ram not sure if linux needs it or not
[11:51] <keith> Kitche, Yes log in, I've set up a username and pwd, but when I try these I get a message that my account is currently suspended
[11:51] <SGersho1> goose: What about the repositories / sources.list ?
[11:51] <hkais> hi
[11:51] <zspada15> keith, is your system clock set properly?
[11:51] <lee2> kitche, i was thinking of getting 4gb of ram, but im not sure if that was just stupid
[11:51] <kitche> keith: if it says that then it suspended on server side
[11:51] <c0dex> hey, I'm trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on my old mac powerbook 1440c but i can't get it to boot from the disc...any suggestions?
[11:51] <goose> SGersho1: all other functions of the update-manager work fine. like install updates
[11:51] <hkais> anyone here who knows how the ubuntu forum is embedded with the mailinglist, and possibly with an nntp?
[11:52] <Dragen> Anybody have any idea why ALT-F2 would suddenly stop working?  lol
[11:52] <goose> SGersho1: it's just that i can't use show updates to see the updates
[11:52] <kybuz> c)dex did you verify your disk
[11:52] <SGersho1> Dragen: Maybe you overwrote the ketboard shortcut
[11:52] <c0dex> umm yea?
[11:52] <Dragen> SGersho1: Went in to the keyboard shortcut keys and everything is set correctly
[11:52] <maxsoft2> no screen found!!?!? HAHAHAA I m in centOs live cd... I  thin that no one linux work well. :(
[11:52] <SGersho1> goose: Does it gives an error message?
[11:53] <n30n> !wireless
[11:53] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:53] <goose> SGersho1: nothing. it just asks for a password like any other gksudo program and then does nothing
[11:53] <Chris_Sutcliff> anyone got any ideas why ndiswrapper fails at build?
[11:53] <Chris_Sutcliff> http://pastebin.co.uk/7100
[11:53] <SGersho1> maxsoft2: Don't give up :)
[11:53] <lee2> i got this damn jmicron chipset that my IDE DVD Writor is connected to. I had problems booting unbuntu last time
[11:53] <kybuz> Can anyone help me out with a script
[11:53] <kitche> Chris_Sutcliff: do you have the linux sources?
[11:53] <humbolt> Question, can I run AIGLX in dapper without updating my Nvidia drivers by enforcing AIGLX mode in beryl?
[11:53] <goose> SGersho1: if you can give me the command line for 'show updates' i can see if it results in any errors
[11:53] <keith> zspada15, I think the system clock is set OK, I'm an hour ahead as I'm now in Barcelona.
[11:54] <SGersho1> goose: And you are sure the sources.list is ok?
[11:54] <n30n> Chris_Sutcliff: Do you have your sources.list file set up correctly?
[11:54] <zspada15> keith, im not sure
[11:54] <Chris_Sutcliff> kitche - i have my own kernel and the sources/headers
[11:54] <wapityyy> I have a problem, in a javascript loop for my ajax script, i have a PHP script connecting to a MYSQL database, but it seems like the loop doenst affect the PHP... anyone know why?
[11:54] <keith> Kitche,  how can I get the server side un-suspended?
[11:54] <Chris_Sutcliff> n30n: yes
[11:54] <goose> SGersho1: i don't know i haven't checked :\ i've been downloading updates without problems though
[11:54] <kitche> keith: support
[11:54] <maxsoft2> how config xserver ?
[11:54] <SGersho1> goose: sudo apt-get update
[11:55] <c0dex> brb
[11:55] <hkais> anyone here who knows how the ubuntu forum is embedded with the mailinglist, and possibly with a nntp?
[11:55] <SGersho1> goose: should check all the updates.
[11:55] <keith> Kitche, Is that ubuntu support?
[11:55] <n30n> Chris_Sutcliff: Define how it fails
[11:55] <Chris_Sutcliff> http://pastebin.co.uk/7100
[11:55] <goose> SGersho1: it complains of duplicate entries in sources.list
[11:55] <goose> i'll remove them i guesss
[11:55] <kitche> Chris_Sutcliff: ndiswrapper might not work well with 2.6.19 yet
[11:56] <c0dex> alright back
[11:56] <SGersho1> goose: You can try. Backup sources.list first... :)
[11:56] <Dragen> Ok so here is my question, are the Keyboard shortcuts (like ALT-F2) part of KDE's Window Manager  Kwin?  cuz i circumvented KDE's window manager by using the environment variable KDEWM=/usr/bin/beryl-manager (so beryl starts automatically) but now my ALT-F2 shortcut is broken.  Funny part is, the other keyboard shortcuts WORK though.
[11:56] <abo> I'm trying to add a new program to the startup in ubuntu (using sytem->preferences->sessions and the Startup Programs tab) I add the command, and see it in the list, then close and open again... and nothing there, do it again, and restart, then nothing happen... reopen, and the command is not there... what's wrong?
[11:56] <Chris_Sutcliff> kitche: damn
[11:56] <n30n> Chris_Sutcliff: Pastebin is slow h/o
[11:56] <c0dex> anyone  know how i can get my powerbook 1440c (running mac os 9) to boot the ubuntu live cd?
[11:57] <Chris_Sutcliff> n30n: its fine for me :S
[11:57] <goose> SGersho1: ok apparently it was one automatix line that created the duplicate entries
[11:57] <keith> Thanks for your help
[11:57] <bimberi> c0dex: hold down C as it powers up (not sure if it works for that particular model though)
[11:57] <Chris_Sutcliff> kitche: one would hope it would work considering the release is a few hours old
[11:58] <n30n> Chris_Sutcliff: I don't think it's compatiable with your setup
[11:58] <SGersho1> goose: It is working fine now?
[11:58] <Chris_Sutcliff> n20n: that sucks :(
[11:58] <Chris_Sutcliff> *n30n:
[11:58] <n30n> Chris_Sutcliff: Otherwise idk what the problem is.
[11:58] <goose> SGersho1: well now it thinks a package manager is working but nothing appears to be running let me check ps
[11:58] <dcordes> what is better about aiglx comparing it to xgl?
[11:58] <Byan> which package will libapr-1.so be in?
[11:59] <kitche> Chris_Sutcliff: ndiswrapper just released a new version?
[11:59] <Chris_Sutcliff> kitche: yes today
[11:59] <SGersho1> Question: Is there a way of having an option in grub that loads a terminal (tty1) only session, with no GUI?
[11:59] <Chris_Sutcliff> kitche: 1.31
[11:59] <toM|vendettA> can anyone help me? i sync my time/date with a server near me, then when I restart my computer it gets reset. anyone know how to fix this?
[11:59] <dcordes> Chris_Sutcliff: did they make up the broadcom support?
[12:00] <Chris_Sutcliff> dcordes: i dont know, have a look in the release log
[12:00] <tormod> SGersho1: single
[12:00] <goose> SGersho1: nope it still isn't working. hovering notifies that there are 4 available updates. but show updates still doesn't do anything
[12:00] <webmaren> i have installed everything I can think of to make it work, but my the wine configure script still says my c compiler cannot create executables
[12:01] <SGersho1> tormod: "single"? I'll google that.
[12:01] <psusi> SGersho1: that's what rescue mode does
[12:01] <_8i5> !msgthebot
[12:01] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[12:01] <goose> SGersho1: there are no other running package managers.
[12:01] <psusi> SGersho1: just choose the rescue mode menu option that is already there
[12:01] <tormod> SGersho1: that's the kernel option
