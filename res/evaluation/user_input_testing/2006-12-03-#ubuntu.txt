[12:01] <levander> Tachoh: are there just type different "types" of kernel packages?  linux-kernel, and linux-image?  I think one is debian packages, the other ubuntu, but I'm not sure

[12:01] <kurisutofuaa> How do I check if my video card supports 3D in ubuntu-Edgyamd64?
[12:01] <javaJake> mc44, it looks like it is supposed to be more of a library for developers.

[12:02] <mc44> javaJake: wrong person?
[12:02] <javaJake> mc44, I'm installing it now, just for the record.
[12:02] <javaJake> mc44, sorry
[12:02] <javaJake> maxamillion, pypanel - lightweight panel/taskbar for X11 window managers
[12:02] <Tachoh> you can aptitude show package to see the full name
[12:02] <javaJake> maxamillion,  it looks like it is supposed to be more of a library for developers.
[12:02] <Tachoh> and details
[12:02] <javaJake> maxamillion, I'm installing it now, just for the record.
[12:03] <maxamillion> javaJake: thankies

[12:04] <hume> hi... I have a question relating to the mozilla-mplayer-plugin
[12:04] <javaJake> maxamillion, bash: pypanel: command not found
[12:04] <gleesond> so after rebooting, I got a cpu temperture too high waringing, I'm assuming that there was some kind of run away when trying to load the live cd
[12:04] <javaJake> Hmmm
[12:04] <hume> it seems I have to choose vo=x11 to run some streams there, but from command line they work with xv.... how come?
[12:04] <Eclypse> what are the necessary packages to do make, and make install?
[12:04] <maxamillion> javaJake: and you are on amd64 as well i presume?
[12:04] <javaJake> maxamillion, nope
[12:04] <javaJake> That makes it interesting
[12:05] <Eclypse> I have build essential installed and all that . . .
[12:05] <ompaul> Eclypse, build-essential
[12:05] <maxamillion> javaJake: oh ... that it does
[12:05] <Eclypse> ompaul, arleady have it . . .
[12:05] <oxyd> i need to know if ubuntu server is something to try, or if its crap as server
[12:05] <helltrix> Can anyone help me with this:? http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper/Release.gpg: Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'
[12:05] <lale> Hello all
[12:05] <ompaul> Eclypse, ehh some target that work on ubuntu then
[12:05] <lale> A quick OT question
[12:05] <Jaak_> my wifi network works but i have to assign essid myself because it won't find them for me like it did in 6.06, what can i do?
[12:05] <reverseblade> oxyd, it is ubuntu with using less ram, not running X etc
[12:05] <javaJake> helltrix, that generally means you have the wrong address.
[12:06] <oxyd> reverseblade: yeah, i know
[12:06] <kerm1t> helltrix: resolv.conf ?
[12:06] <javaJake> maxamillion, hmm, same exact results here for locate.
[12:06] <ompaul> Eclypse, what is not compiling?
[12:06] <lale> How do you say in technical speak that a problem can be led back to another, known problem?
[12:06] <lale> is there a specific word?
[12:06] <kitche> helltrix: does rest of your internet work?
[12:06] <oxyd> reverseblade: but that was not my question
[12:06] <helltrix> yes
[12:06] <Eclypse> ompaul gaim 2.0 beta 5
[12:06] <helltrix> im on IRC, web browsing, etc.
[12:06] <reverseblade> oxyd, ok
[12:06] <oxyd> i need to now if it run smootly and fine as server
[12:07] <maxamillion> javaJake: strange, it doesn't _really_ matter ... i just read about it somewhere and thought i would try it out ... but i thought it was weird that the package didn't install an executable
[12:07] <kitche> helltrix: then it's probably to do with the dns for that address or soemthign if rest of your net works
[12:07] <helltrix> nameserver 192.168.1.121 is my name server to my routed computer
[12:07] <javaJake> maxamillion, yea, it appears to be a window manager, possibly?
[12:07] <High_Priest> again: my friend here is trying to boot ubuntu 6.10 on compaq laptop.. without success.. after splash and progress bar he gets black screen with blinking cursor and it just stays there.. fail-safe option acts the same.. any ideas?
[12:07] <maxamillion> javaJake: no, its a panel for people who run things like fluxbox, windowmaker, etc.
[12:07] <gleesond> is there any advaced options for the first install screen? maybe to control the run levels
[12:08] <G3N3SIS> want me to reboot strabes?
[12:08] <ompaul> Eclypse, what version of ubuntu are you using?
[12:08] <Raskall> javaJake: my problem was in the nx client. I had to set the keyboard layout in the nx client.
[12:08] <reverseblade> gleesond, what do you require ?
[12:08] <Eclypse> ompaul 6.06
[12:08] <Raskall> javaJake: and then I managed to get xfce running too. :)
[12:09] <Joel-Wideman> How do I set time restrictions on local logins, per user?
[12:09] <ompaul> Eclypse, it appears that the software you want is in the next version up
[12:09] <gleesond> well if I can make the instalation not boot the X server then I could install and hand config the xorg.cong
[12:09] <r00t-fck> hey guys . i have installed eggdrop . and i dont know where is it installed . i use apt-get install eggdrop
[12:09] <reverseblade> Joel-Wideman, such a harsh admin :)
[12:09] <Eclypse> ompaul, that doesn't make any sense.
[12:09] <javaJake> Raskall, Oh, OK.
[12:09] <kurisutofuaa> I just did a fresh install of Edgy amd64. What programs should I download right away?
[12:09] <Joel-Wideman> Yup.

[12:09] <helltrix> added 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 and now updates are working.
[12:09] <Eclypse> ompaul, hmm. . . . lame.
[12:10] <gleesond> or if I could see where in the live boot what is failing because as it is right now I cant see what modules are being loaded

[12:11] <rnalexander> Hello, could I bother someone with a question please?
[12:11] <Tachoh> yes
[12:11] <levander> Okay, way back in hoary days I think, I installed linux-686-smp so that my kernel would be kept up-to-date.  Apparently, at some point they decided to stop updating that package, and now my kernel is really old.  It looks like I'm supposed to replace it with either linux-image-gerneic or linux-image-686, someone can tell me which one?

[12:11] <SuperQ> levander: just install linux-generic
[12:11] <reverseblade> Joel-Wideman, just shutdown the electricity , lol
[12:12] <levander> Tachoh: SuperQ: will the kernels that get installed from those support SMP?
[12:12] <SuperQ> levander: it will include all the deps for image and other things
[12:12] <javaJake> levander, install generic
[12:12] <SuperQ> levander: generic is smp now
[12:12] <rnalexander> Thank you, I'm using remote desktop sharing on a Dapper Desktop install, I'm attempt to control it from my mac using Chicken of the VNC, but the response time is very slow.  I'm on a subnet, but my mac is on wireless.  How do I configure my Dapper box to use connection compression even when it's on a local subnet?
[12:12] <javaJake> SuperQ, smp?
[12:12] <SuperQ> levander: and replaces 686/386
[12:12] <monestis>  Is it true that you can destroy your drive if you overburn a cd/dvd?
[12:12] <Tachoh> levander: what he said :)
[12:12] <levander> okay, thanks guys, think i'll install linux-image-generic
[12:12] <Seveas> monestis, yes
[12:12] <SuperQ> javaJake: yes, generic is smp now

[12:13] <javaJake> SuperQ, no no, what does smp mean?

[12:13] <levander> ubuntu devs are better than this, no idea why they screwed it up

[12:13] <Seveas> javaJake, I'm just hunting for bots
[12:13] <superchode> it seemed reasonable to me that i could just plug in another hard drive and it would work.. was that unreasonable? how do i fix this?

[12:13] <Tachoh> levander: :)
[12:13] <ompaul> javaJake, he is looking for unauthorised bots

[12:15] <ubotu> Failed.
[12:15] <carlfk> MannyL,   ouch.  good q
[12:15] <Klee_> oh thanks
[12:15] <rnalexander> Did I phrase the question wrong?
[12:15] <javaJake> levander, no, different package. Confused the heck out of me.
[12:15] <levander> javaJake: what package?
[12:15] <carlfk> MannyL, does it boot any linux right now?
[12:15] <javaJake> Especially choosing between 686 and generic. :P
[12:16] <javaJake> levander, generic
[12:16] <dv5237> how can i disable needing to fill in my password after i close the lid of my notebook?
[12:16] <javaJake> levander, that does all processors.
[12:16] <MannyL> carlfk no just 2003 server and FreeDOS. To install FreeDos I had to put a 16 gig IDE drive in and use VMServer then mount the physical drive
[12:16] <Joel-Wideman> I'm going to split.
[12:16] <levander> javaJake: okay, thanks, i'm praying this kernel upgrade works, i've modified /etc/fstab and grub's menu.lst to boot a "mostly" upgraded to edgy system
[12:16] <rnalexander> Can anyone tell me how to set up connection compression on the remote desktop sharing on a Dapper Desktop install?
[12:16] <levander> i'm gonna go get a smoke before I try this kernel upgrade
[12:16] <javaJake> levander, lol.
[12:17] <Tachoh> levander: have two :)
[12:17] <dv5237> i know its possible i have seen it somewhere but after my clean install i cant remember where :/
[12:17] <G3N3SIS> Is anyone here, experienced with sound in Ubuntu?
[12:17] <SuperQ> dv5237: System: Preferences: Screen Saver
[12:17] <MannyL> carlfk can I use loadlin from FreeDos to somehow kickstart the install?
[12:17] <javaJake> Tachoh, no kidding. :|
[12:17] <G3N3SIS> After 2 hours, I still can't configure it.
[12:17] <javaJake> levander, seriously? You do know that's bad for you.
[12:17] <Tachoh> lol
[12:17] <javaJake> Right?
[12:17] <dv5237> SuperQ: nope. not option there
[12:17] <javaJake> :P
[12:17] <superchode> G3N3SIS: i spent a considerable amount of time getting it working yesterday
[12:17] <carlfk> MannyL, maybe.  I just discovered kexec, which loads and runs kernels from a booted linux
[12:18] <SuperQ> dv5237: "Lock Screen when screensaver is active" ?
[12:18] <javaJake> dv5237, In System -> Preferences -> Screensaver.
[12:18] <SuperQ> dv5237: closing the lid activates the screensaver
[12:18] <ColonelPanic001> Hi. I'm running Kubuntu Edgy, and my SD card read (USB) runs great, apps auto-mount it and everything, except that it's read only, despite me having full permissions. Any ideas?
[12:18] <orain> mc44 I'm on irc using the same pc it should be a little easier the link: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35130/
[12:19] <G3N3SIS> superchode can you join a channel with me?
[12:19] <carlfk> MannyL, which lets me wget the netboot kernel/initrd and run it, which starts the installer (it just takes over the system)
[12:19] <dv5237> SuperQ: so i should turn of my screensaver completly?
[12:19] <G3N3SIS> I dunno #Ubuntusound?
[12:19] <G3N3SIS> without the questionmark
[12:19] <javaJake> dv5237, well, there's this as well: System -> Preferences -> Power Options. "Blank Screen" option for "When lid is closed" will lock your screen.
[12:19] <SuperQ> dv5237: no.. you just need to uncheck lock when activated
[12:19] <malco> hey I have totally fragged my xorg.conf file (I think) while trying to install nvidia graphics card.  For some reason the backup isn't there either.  How do I get it back to what it was before
[12:19] <mc44> orain: hmm nothing is muted, which I though t it might have been
[12:19] <dv5237> SuperQ: that option issnt there.. what release do you run?
[12:19] <carlfk> MannyL, give me a sec... I'll dig up the URL's I used.  worth a shot
[12:19] <rnalexander> Have I been muted or something?  Is my question somehow rude and I don't know it?
[12:19] <SuperQ> dv5237: oh.. i'm on edgy right now
[12:19] <MannyL> carlfk kexec sounds great to me but I need something that runs under 2003 or Dos
[12:19] <javaJake> dv5237, what release are you running, more to the point. :)
[12:19] <dv5237> javaJake: yeah but thats gonna take alot of my battery power
[12:19] <mc44> orain: does "lsmod | grep hda" show anything?
[12:19] <SuperQ> javaJake: heh

[12:20] <G3N3SIS> superchode?
[12:20] <carlfk> MannyL, you mentioned loadlin... may be the same thing as kexec
[12:20] <orain> t find a solution
[12:20] <javaJake> dv5237, blanking your screen does? :s
[12:20] <javaJake> orain, what are you working on?
[12:20] <SuperQ> dv5237: your laptop hardware will probably force-blank the screen when you close
[12:20] <orain> sound has stopped working

[12:21] <javaJake> dv5237, huh, really. Dapper...
[12:21] <javaJake> dv5237, hmm...
[12:21] <javaJake> dv5237, two seconds...
[12:21] <rnalexander> Ok, so my questions are showing up...  am I asking them the wrong way?
[12:21] <Jaak_> are there any extra wifi tools?
[12:21] <ColonelPanic001> SuperQ: thanks. It's odd, because really, it works great. Just can't write/delete/etc

[12:21] <nickfish03> trying to boot ubuntu live cd onto a old g3 indigo iMac, 233 MHz (Machine speed), booting goes fine until right after loading bar finishes, in begining it comes up with "yaboot 1.13.1" or something like that, it then goes to Ubuntu logo and starts to bounce a bar back and forth, then it will load one bar, after bar finishes, i come up with a  black screen with white cursor on it, i can type into it, but i haven't entered anything,
[12:21] <rnalexander> please could someone even just point me to the config file for the remote desktop server in dapper?
[12:21] <eloquence_> leet
[12:21] <ColonelPanic001> Malexander: it's a busy channel. Usually if someone doesn't know the answer, they just don't say anything. prevents traffic
[12:22] <dv5237> i just needed to disable blanking screen whitin ubuntu
[12:22] <javaJake> rnalexander, you mean VNC server?
[12:22] <rnalexander> Is it using VNC?  'cause I searched for it and couldn't find a VNC.conf file.
[12:22] <javaJake> rnalexander, yea, it is...
[12:22] <eloquence_> dv5237: i am running kubuntu on a dv8000t ... how's the lappie on linux working out for u? or is it originally made for linux?
[12:22] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: I just put my SD card from my cell phone into my Thinkpad's internal SD slot
[12:22] <javaJake> rnalexander, your client _should_ let you choose that...
[12:22] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: and was able to write no issue
[12:22] <rnalexander> Chicken of the VNC doesn't...
[12:22] <ColonelPanic001> SuperQ: Well, then, give my your laptop, Mr. "Works for me!"
[12:22] <ColonelPanic001> ;)

[12:23] <dv5237> eloquence_: i works find though no problem so far :)
[12:23] <levander> It doesn't look like installing linux-image-generic is going to uninstall linux-image-686-smp.  Is that something to worry about?
[12:23] <eloquence_> cool ... running ubuntu dapper?
[12:23] <G3N3SIS> oh superchode, i can't send messages back.
[12:23] <G3N3SIS> can you join my channel ubuntusound?
[12:23] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: haha
[12:23] <eloquence_> u got the regular dial up modem to work?
[12:23] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: just to verify, the photo I copied to the SD card shows up when I put it back in my phone
[12:23] <javaJake> rnalexander, I have no experience with Macs unfortunately.
[12:23] <dv5237> eloquence_: cant install edgy though but i think dapper is more stable anyway so ill keep running dapper untill feasty comes
[12:24] <ColonelPanic001> SuperQ: Joking aside, any ideas, maybe? I don't know crap about USB device handling or whatnot, let alone about this in particular
[12:24] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: best thing you can do is open a terminal and look at the output of dmesg
[12:24] <eloquence_> cool i eam running dapper too i had ubuntu but now switched to kubuntu to see how it works
[12:24] <orain> javajake: I had my sound working with edgy on a thinkpad x60, but it stopped after two days. It still works in windows.
[12:24] <eloquence_> what kind of wireless lan card do u have?
[12:24] <gleesond> so it appears that it locks up as soon as the live cd trys to load gnome
[12:25] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: or if you don't know what to look for, do this from a terminal
[12:25] <javaJake> orain, yea, I don't know. I would google different combinations of stuff.
[12:25] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: dmesg > ColonelPanic001.txt
[12:25] <ColonelPanic001> SuperQ: Just did that, getting a filesystem panic. Mind if I PM a few lines to you?
[12:25] <SuperQ> ColonelPanic001: and mail it to superq@gmail.com
[12:25] <javaJake> orain, I'd also google the sound card's model itself.
[12:25] <ColonelPanic001> Or that. heh
[12:25] <dv5237> eloquence_:  802.11g im not sure about the rest.. its a intergrated one
[12:26] <ColonelPanic001> SuperQ: pastebin'ing it. Soon as this site actually does something...
[12:26] <SuperQ> oh.. hehe
[12:26] <eloquence_> dv5237: oh so u didn't install the intel drivers then
[12:27] <SuperQ> i forget about pastebin
[12:27] <javaJake> orain, I'm hearing a lot about Vine, a VNC Server...
[12:27] <javaJake> orain, nvm... forgot...
[12:27] <javaJake> orain, looking for client. :P
[12:27] <dv5237> eloquence_: nope just the one for vga are there anymore?
[12:27] <ColonelPanic001> SuperQ: http://paste-bin.com/1696
[12:27] <orain> thanks
[12:27] <rnalexander> thanks folks, I'll see what I can dig up.
[12:27] <Raskall> ahh.. nice. I am running an nx desktop over UMTS now. and it runs fast and smooth
[12:27] <eloquence_> umm

[12:27] <eloquence_> i dunno i wanted to find something for my HDA audio
[12:28] <eloquence_> but dunno
[12:28] <eloquence_> what did u use for vga?
[12:28] <javaJake> orain, hmm... I'd google "osx vnc client"... pulls up a lot of stuff. But according to what I know the client is responsible for saying "yea, I want this and that compressed".
[12:28] <dv5237> eloquence_: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 and you?
[12:29] <orain> vine is for mac isn't it?
[12:29] <eloquence_> oh

[12:30] <eloquence_> or whatever u call it
[12:30] <carlfk> javaJake, can I get a msg if I am not registered ?
[12:30] <orain> I have to say I'm know to ubuntu and  I love it, but it will be even better when I get everything working
[12:30] <javaJake> carlfk, I don't know..
[12:31] <javaJake> carlfk, I'd register all the same. :)
[12:31] <ompaul> carlfk, you can
[12:31] <carlfk> MannyL, check out the bottem of that page - I just added the wget commands for where you can get the installer.  see if that works with loadlin
[12:31] <levander> carlfk: no you can't, register, "/msg Nick
[12:31] <javaJake> orain, yep, I can agree.
[12:31] <carlfk> ompaul, thanks

[12:32] <orain> good luck and thanks for the help
[12:32] <javaJake> carlfk, to register, just type in "/msg nickserv register <password>"
[12:32] <javaJake> Simple
[12:32] <javaJake> Right everyone else? :P
[12:32] <kbrooks> javaJake: wrong
[12:33] <carlfk> actually, I just need to ident or something.  wich I don't need to do, cuz I don't want to msg anyone right now :)
[12:33] <MannyL> carlfk can you E-mail me the address of that app to emanuel.levy@gmail.com I'm going to try to install dsl-linux then use that app to bet ubuntu up
[12:33] <javaJake> kbrooks, no way!....
[12:33] <carlfk> MannyL, or anyone - what is the URL lor Loadlin?
[12:33] <javaJake> kbrooks, no, that's right
[12:33] <carlfk> MannyL, not now - my main box is running memcheck
[12:34] <Plouj> Hi. so, I got this pcmcia wna-2330 dlink adapter. I plugged it into my ubuntu laptop and ifconfig shows two devices, wifi0 and ath0. Which one should I be configuring? I'm trying to configure the device by following this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202834&highlight=WNA-2330
[12:34] <ompaul> kbrooks, you are incorrect
[12:34] <carlfk> MannyL, how will you install dsl?
[12:36] <cpk1> Plouj: you should probably configure the one that isnt in ifconfig when the pcmcia isnt plugged in =P
[12:36] <MannyL> carl I can use vmwar to install it to the drive that FreeDOS is on.
[12:36] <nickfish03> i have screen troubles on my g3, for booting option should i use, boot: live video=ofonly or should i use boot: live-powerpc   ??
[12:36] <nickfish03> the screen goes black
[12:36] <Plouj> cpk1: why would I want to do that? I need to use the pcmcia card.
[12:37] <javaJake> Yay, it's quieter now!
[12:37] <cpk1> Plouj: you said you wanted to know which one to configure, to figure out which interface is the pcmcia one, take it out, the one that dissapears is the pcmcia interface, now you know which one to configure
[12:37] <ortega10> i installed the newest version of avidemux from the getdeb website, but update-manager keeps nagging me about an older update (from edgy), no matter how many times i select "force version" or "lock version" in synaptic... what can i do?
[12:37] <Plouj> cpk1: oh, ok
[12:38] <Plouj> cpk1: I see what you mean now ;)
[12:38] <gleesond> does anyone know how to make the live cd boot to a cmd propt before loading gnome? I need this to fix the xorg.conf before it locks up
[12:38] <MannyL> I know I should get an IDE cd drive but I don't want to spend more money on this one system.
[12:38] <javaJake> ortega10, unfortunately I don't think you can do anything.
[12:39] <javaJake> gleesond, yes, when you see the "3, 2, 1" countdown on startup, hit ESC, and choose recovery mode.
[12:39] <cpk1> ortega10: you didnt install the newest from a repo?
[12:39] <ortega10> javaJake: but why doesn't the "lock version" option stay checked in synaptic?
[12:39] <javaJake> Once you are done, type "exit" to continue with startup.
[12:39] <javaJake> ortega10, no clue... try installing this older version and see what happens. If it starts downloading, cancel it.
[12:40] <ortega10> cpk1: i did, and then i installed a newer deb
[12:40] <porkpie> guy's what is the package name of spamcop
[12:40] <javaJake> ortega10, what are the two versions?
[12:40] <Plouj> now, it looks like that both ath0 and wifi0 are _only_ present when my pcmcia card is plugged in
[12:40] <cpk1> ortega10: try using aptitude hold avidemux
[12:40] <gleesond> javaJake: I never see a "1 2 3" count down with this live disk
[12:40] <javaJake> gleesond, right right
[12:41] <javaJake> gleesond, when you get in the live cd, you should see something like "F6 Other Options".
[12:41] <gleesond> yeah I can get that
[12:41] <javaJake> gleesond, when you get that, erase the "--" and "quiet" and "splash" and type in "single".
[12:41] <ortega10> cpk1: didn't seem to change anything
[12:41] <gleesond> ok will try
[12:42] <javaJake> gleesond, then punch enter. Basically, you manually told the livecd to run recovery mode.
[12:42] <ortega10> javaJake: i got 2.3.0.1-getdeb1 and it tries to install 2.1.2.0-ubuntu
[12:42] <cpk1> ortega10: is avidemux the name of the package?
[12:42] <jared> hi
[12:42] <ortega10> javaJake: it's weird cause my version is newer
[12:42] <javaJake> porkpie, is this it? "hinfo - Check address ownership and DNSBL listings for spam reporting"
[12:42] <ortega10> cpk1: yep
[12:43] <javaJake> ortega10, wow, yea... report this as a bug!
[12:43] <cpk1> try aptitude update now and see if it still wants to update it
[12:43] <javaJake> ortega10, cpk1, good idea
[12:43] <kitche> ortega10: it probably because you used a non-ubuntu .deb
[12:43] <nickfish03> when i try to boot off of a live cd (im on a g3 imac) i get past the loading bar, then i am at a blinking cursor, that is when my screen goes into "sleep mode" and wont wake up, any help?
[12:43] <javaJake> kitche, but shouldn't it be able to recognize that?
[12:44] <ortega10> kitche: i do that often, and i don't have this problem with other packages
[12:44] <jared> hi
[12:44] <jbinder> hi
[12:44] <jbinder> ??
[12:44] <javaJake> hi
[12:44] <jbinder> WTF
[12:44] <javaJake> :D
[12:44] <jbinder> uh
[12:44] <jbinder> i am so confused
[12:44] <G3N3SIS> guys new error message.
[12:44] <G3N3SIS> in XMMS
[12:45] <ompaul> !test
[12:45] <ubotu> Failed.
[12:45] <javaJake> lol
[12:45] <jbinder> is #ubuntu@irc.ubuntu.com and #ubuntu@irc.freenode.net the same thing?
[12:45] <cpk1> ortega10: you probably shouldnt have tried to install it over the previous aptitude install but thats ok
[12:45] <ompaul> jbinder, I hope so :)
[12:45] <jbinder> lol
[12:45] <G3N3SIS> it says couldn't open :  Please check that your soundcard is configured properly, you have the correct plugin selected, and no other program is blocking your soundcard.
[12:45] <jbinder> jared = me too
[12:45] <G3N3SIS> How do I check those?
[12:46] <kitche> G3N3SIS: you using gnome?
[12:46] <gleesond> So now I have a root prompt on the live disk I tryed to change the driver in xorg.conf to fglrx and run startx but it tells me there was an error
[12:47] <G3N3SIS> Yeah kitche
[12:47] <gleesond> fglrx does not exist on the livecd
[12:47] <gleesond> not sure what plan of attack to take from here
[12:47] <G3N3SIS> kitche?
[12:48] <princemackenzie> gleesond, i believe you can still apt-get it from the livecd
[12:48] <kitche> G3N3SIS: it's probably due to esd taking your sound or you might have another app running that is using it
[12:48] <javaJake> gleesond, alright, try apt-getting the fglrx driver
[12:48] <gleesond> ok, cool
[12:48] <javaJake> sudo apt-get install fglrx-driver possibly?
[12:48] <javaJake> I've never dealt with it before...
[12:48] <G3N3SIS> what's esd and what other app might be running it?
[12:48] <gleesond> well its already in root
[12:49] <javaJake> gleesond, oh, ok
[12:49] <javaJake> oh, so you ran X manually?
[12:49] <javaJake> Interestin'. Not a bad idea
[12:49] <kitche> G3N3SIS: esd is enlightenment sound daemon it's what gnome uses sorta like arts for kde
[12:49] <javaJake> Though X'll complain later. :)
[12:49] <spx2> hello ?
[12:49] <javaJake> spx2, hey
[12:49] <spx2> i need some help with xorg.conf
[12:49] <spx2> javajake can you help please ?
[12:49] <javaJake> spx2, ok, whatcha need?
[12:49] <G3N3SIS> how would I make sure that nothing is using it?
[12:50] <orain> javaJake:  I ran the command (head /proc/asound/card0/codec#0) and presto --sound works. I think i have a ghost in my notebook, because that is just to weird.
[12:50] <spx2> javajake well i'm trying to set up my usb mouse
[12:50] <javaJake> spx2, mmK
[12:50] <spx2> javajake the problem is that i have to set an option Protocol in xorg.conf
[12:50] <javaJake> orain, lol
[12:50] <javaJake> spx2, OK
[12:50] <spx2> javajake and i don't know what should i set it to for usb
[12:51] <javaJake> spx2, oh, I see
[12:51] <spx2> javajake i can tell you what value it has for ps/2
[12:51] <G3N3SIS> ??
[12:51] <javaJake> Um, how do I search for text within man?
[12:51] <mc44> orain: wo!
[12:51] <mc44> *woo
[12:51] <spx2> javajake with "/"
[12:51] <spx2> javajake i searched alredy
[12:51] <carlfk> MannyL, i never got a reply to: how can you install dsl on a box with no boot devices?
[12:51] <orain> mc44 any idea why that worked
[12:51] <javaJake> spx2, thanks, OK, lol
[12:52] <spx2> javajake found nothing
[12:52] <javaJake> Really???
[12:52] <G3N3SIS> kitche?
[12:52] <javaJake> spx2, where are you punching in this option?
[12:52] <mc44> orain: it really should have, so no
[12:52] <spx2> javajake yes javajake,i tried to solve the problem on my own,i've seen that i am not able and now i came here
[12:52] <javaJake> spx2, what driver are you using?
[12:52] <spx2> javajake just a second
[12:52] <mc44> orain: shouldn't have I mean
[12:52] <javaJake> spx2, no problem
[12:52] <ompaul> spx2, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org   <-- that should do to the job for you
[12:53] <javaJake> ompaul, hmm, if, that is, it was already configured, but his mouse wasn't.
[12:53] <javaJake> ompaul, also, you throw the user through tons of questions doing that.
[12:53] <G3N3SIS> Somebody help me?
[12:53] <ompaul> spx2, usb should be automagic - try plugging it into another socket
[12:53] <gleesond> w00t, gnome is booting!
[12:53] <javaJake> gleesond, yes!
[12:54] <spx2> ompaul that is just written in the comment at the start of xorg.conf,i tried that already,it actually took me back to vesa video driver as i already had autodetected ati radeon and it left my mouse the way it was,so nothing good happened
[12:54] <javaJake> gleesond, don't get too happy! edgy'll dash your hopes in a moment.
[12:54] <gleesond> heh
[12:54] <kitche> G3N3SIS: well what applicatins did/have open
[12:54] <spx2> javajake search for /dev/input/mice in xorg.conf and you will see the area where the option Protocol must be set
[12:54] <javaJake> spx2, ok
[12:55] <gleesond> javaJake: where is the install script on the live cd?
[12:55] <G3N3SIS> I have GAIM firefox
[12:55] <G3N3SIS> terminal
[12:55] <javaJake> gleesond, lol, why?
[12:55] <MannyL> Hmm this may work.
[12:55] <G3N3SIS> file browser and xmms
[12:55] <javaJake> gleesond, you should be able to install straight from gnome
[12:55] <gleesond> I can't find it
[12:55] <kitche> G3N3SIS: firefox can use your sound and gaim can also
[12:55] <spx2> javajake currently for me it is "ExplorerPS/2" wich practically makes absolutely no sense because i have an usb mouse(altough it works(the mouse)for 10-20seconds after that it freezes and only my pad is available to me for replacing the mouse function)
[12:55] <usr13> What is the command you use after making changes to sources.list ?
[12:55] <G3N3SIS> I'm talking to you thru gaim though.
[12:55] <orain> Thanks javaJake and mc44. Im going to reboot and see what happens. It's interesting that the sound is quite distorted.
[12:56] <usr13> apt-get update?  Or?
[12:56] <mwe> display icon.jpg says 'display: unable to load font `-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'. Anyone know what package I need to install?
[12:56] <rc-1> hmm the system, quit menu isnt showing up is there a command to reboot?
[12:56] <bruenig> usr13, you just open it up and add stuff to it
[12:56] <javaJake> spx2, the wierd thing is I have a usb mouse and it works alongside my pad.
[12:56] <bruenig> usr13, oh after, yeah sudo apt-get update
[12:56] <orain> brb
[12:56] <kitche> G3N3SIS: well you can turn sound off in gaim
[12:56] <G3N3SIS> See, Kitche, at the top right of my screen it says I am missing GStreamer plugins and/or Devices
[12:56] <ompaul> spx2, I run several boxes of various versions of xorg and usb mice don't seem to mind as long as they are the right type  >>  /dev/input/mice ; and   protocol of "ExplorerPS/2 << this does both usb and
[12:56] <javaJake> gleesond, I recommend typing Ctrl+Alt+F1, killing gnome, and typing exit.
[12:56] <G3N3SIS> I installed the plugins
[12:56] <jbinder> gtg
[12:56] <jbinder> bye
[12:56] <usr13> ok tnx
[12:56] <javaJake> spx2, what mouse is it?
[12:56] <G3N3SIS> and I can verify my device is there.
[12:56] <ompaul> spx2, and I change mice on the fly
[12:56] <G3N3SIS> lspci -v says it is.
[12:56] <woro2006> hey
[12:57] <G3N3SIS> k turned off gaim sounds
[12:57] <woro2006> after doing aptitude purge sendmail, /etc/init.d/networking restart still contains sendmail messages
[12:57] <spx2> javajake it's just an ordinary usb mouse
[12:57] <rc-1> javaJake, did you mean that to me?
[12:57] <woro2006> it says reload sendmail or something
[12:57] <nickfish03> can someone please help with some sreen problems
[12:57] <nickfish03> *screen
[12:57] <woro2006> where do i find the sendmail script
[12:57] <javaJake> rc-1, no
[12:57] <spx2> ompaul well my mouse freezes after 10-20 seconds of use,what can i do ?
[12:57] <princemackenzie> nickfish03, whats wrong
[12:57] <spx2> ompaul can i try another driver or smth ?
[12:57] <javaJake> rc-1, there is a command.
[12:57] <woro2006> /etc/network/ifup.d/ ??
[12:57] <rc-1> javaJake, sorry :( what is it?
[12:58] <gleesond> javaJake++ that was the ticket
[12:58] <javaJake> rc-1, goto Ctrl+Alt+F1, and type "sudo reboot" for reboot
[12:58] <rc-1> thanks
[12:58] <javaJake> gleesond, alright!
[12:58] <javaJake> rc-1, np
[12:58] <javaJake> gleesond, I TOLD you X would complain. :D
[12:58] <G3N3SIS> i've been here lookiong for help for 2 hours.
[12:58] <ompaul> spx2, I would try a different mouse first the driver seems to work for almost everyone else, you might consider this, moving it to another usb port
[12:58] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, yea, that happens
[12:58] <G3N3SIS> Some help would be of great appreciation.
[12:58] <G3N3SIS> More than 2 hours, almost 4, lost track of time sorry.
[12:59] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, I know it sounds, well, hack-ish, but try killing different processes that you might've run.
[12:59] <cheeseboy> help w/ what?
[12:59] <gleesond> heh
[12:59] <G3N3SIS> like what processes?
[12:59] <spx2> ompaul i have seen posts on ubuntuforums.blah on the net with the same problem so i think i am not the only one
[12:59] <Willacuz> Hey ther
[12:59] <DrNick_> does anyone else have any problems connecting to DALnet with Xchat on ubuntu?
[12:59] <nickfish03> prince: i get past loading bar and screen goes black and will not turn on
[12:59] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, well, firefox (flash), gaim, etc.
[12:59] <eyalw> hi
[12:59] <Elda> I am curious, would it caused any problems if I had gnome and kde installed?
[12:59] <nickfish03> prince: i hear the ubuntu sound while it is still black
[12:59] <Elda> *cause
[12:59] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, anything that might use sound but isn't important.
[12:59] <Willacuz> Volume question:    How can I set my keyboards volume control to control the PCM channel instead of MASTER ?
[12:59] <kitche> Elda: no it won't cause problems
[12:59] <G3N3SIS> I can't close gaim, but I turned it's sounds off.
[01:00] <G3N3SIS> I do hear my computer beeping if I try backspacing in terminal when there is nothing to backspace.
[01:00] <eyalw> i have a question, i cannot resize windows in ubuntu, anyone got an idea?
[01:00] <ompaul> spx2, did you move the mouse from one usb port to another?
[01:00] <G3N3SIS> Closed firefox as well.
[01:00] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, you ARE using esd, right?
[01:00] <G3N3SIS> what is it?
[01:00] <G3N3SIS> How would I know if I am?
[01:00] <Seilo>  hi guys
[01:00] <Seilo>  i need help
[01:00] <Seilo>  with bazaar
[01:00] <spx2> ompaul please wait 3minutes while i try that,i will be back as soon as i can with a conclusion
[01:00] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, erm, well, System -> Preferences -> Sound would tell you
[01:00] <mwe> what do I need to install to get the helvetica font? imagemagick complains about missing helvetica font.
[01:01] <eyalw> help? i cannot resize windows in ubuntu, anyone got an idea?
[01:01] <princemackenzie> !msttfcorefonts
[01:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about msttfcorefonts - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:01] <javaJake> eyalw, say what???
[01:01] <G3N3SIS> would it say ESD anywhere?
[01:01] <ompaul> spx2, I have work to do here see if I am available
[01:01] <Elda> eyalw : Are you running Beryl by chance?
[01:01] <javaJake> princemackenzie, automatix (please don't flame me) will do this.
[01:01] <eyalw> Elda: yes
[01:01] <princemackenzie> mwe, there is a font package whose name escapes me
[01:01] <DrNick_> has anyone else had problems connecting to DALnet in Xchat? strangely ever since using Ubuntu I can't connect.
[01:01] <Elda> If so you have to enable the resize plugin
[01:01] <ArrenLex> !msttcorefonts | princemackenzie
[01:01] <ubotu> msttcorefonts: Installer for Microsoft TrueType core fonts. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 22 kB, installed size 164 kB
[01:01] <Elda> eyalw : Okey, just activate the resize plugin.  I had the same question yesterday ^.^
[01:02] <eyalw> Elda: how can i do that?
[01:02] <princemackenzie> !msttcorefonts | mwe
[01:02] <Elda> Hold on a second
[01:02] <bruenig> how do I close a man page
[01:02] <ArrenLex> bruenig: q
[01:02] <eyalw> Elda: in the preferense?
[01:02] <bruenig> I was ctrl + q
[01:02] <mwe> princemackenzie: I have that one. I don't think imagemagick is using it
[01:02] <G3N3SIS> Javajake, I have sound preferences there.  If I try hitting the play next to some, nothing will happen.
[01:02] <Elda> First pull up Beryl settings manager, and then scroll down through the options
[01:02] <G3N3SIS> And it says there is no default sound card.
[01:02] <spx2> ompaul i understand ,sorry ,i don't want to bother
[01:02] <Elda> One of them should be a resize plugin
[01:02] <mwe> princemackenzie: display: unabldisplay: unable to load font `-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'e to load font `-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'
[01:02] <G3N3SIS> When I go into lspci -v it says there is a sound card.
[01:02] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, no, it'll tell you what you are using
[01:03] <G3N3SIS> where?
[01:03] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, on tab "Devices".
[01:03] <Elda> After doing that just select the check box and viola xD
[01:03] <G3N3SIS> oh ESD is on!
[01:03] <princemackenzie> mwe, i'm unfamiliar with imagemagick im sorry
[01:03] <ompaul> spx2, ask and see what happens
[01:03] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, yea, is anything there ESD?
[01:03] <G3N3SIS> i'm in dapper btw edgy dind't install for me
[01:03] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, ah, OK
[01:03] <mwe> shite ;|
[01:03] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, try killing any esd processes
[01:03] <eyalw> Elda: ok, let me see...
[01:03] <G3N3SIS> should i turn esd off?
[01:03] <G3N3SIS> where would I kill them?
[01:03] <Rprp> Hi, does someone know how to open a file in gftp from the command line?
[01:03] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, that'll do the trick... your sound (if that's the issue) will come back
[01:03] <javaJake> Terminal
[01:03] <Megaqwerty> gaim's sounds just stopped working
[01:03] <javaJake> sudo killall esd.
[01:03] <Megaqwerty> Ideas?
[01:03] <G3N3SIS> k
[01:04] <Willacuz>    How can I set my keyboards volume control to control the PCM channel instead of MASTER ?
[01:04] <javaJake> Megaqwerty, you muted them? :P
[01:04] <Elda> eyalw: Its under the put option
[01:04] <Megaqwerty> javaJake: I doubt it
[01:04] <Elda> Or beneath it anyways
[01:04] <javaJake> Megaqwerty, Right click on the Gaim icon, and be sure you didn't check the Mute Sounds button.
[01:04] <spx2> ompaul i just tried all 4 usbs ,none of them work with my mouse,i can also guarantee that on windows all was working fine,so every hardware issue is eliminated
[01:04] <Megaqwerty> javaJake: my speakers are unmuted, and I enabled them
[01:04] <G3N3SIS> says no processes killed.
[01:04] <Megaqwerty>  javaJake: there is no check there
[01:04] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, hmm, ok...
[01:04] <ompaul> spx2, what kind of computer desktop / laptop?
[01:05] <eyalw> Elda: i found it, thanks!
[01:05] <javaJake> Megaqwerty, alright, I don't know then. That was my only idea. :P
[01:05] <Megaqwerty>  javaJake: and I can play sound files
[01:05] <eyalw> Elda: first time i got help on IRC
[01:05] <Megaqwerty> alright. thanks though. Can anyone else help me?
[01:05] <Elda> No problem, happy I was able to help :)
[01:05] <G3N3SIS> Lucky, I can't hear anything except logout and bootup
[01:05] <Megaqwerty> ^^
[01:05] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, that's it?
[01:05] <Elda> Ah, hehe
[01:05] <G3N3SIS> yeah.
[01:05] <woro2006> why can't i have both postfix and sendmail together?
[01:05] <woro2006> can't they coexist?
[01:05] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, so you can hear music?
[01:05] <Elda> Well Ive been using linux four about ~ 7 days
[01:05] <javaJake> !!
[01:05] <eyalw> Elda: its my second day on ubuntu, or linux at all...
[01:05] <Rprp> Hi, does someone know how to open a file in gftp from the command line?
[01:05] <G3N3SIS> negative
[01:05] <Elda> So Im happy I could help xD
[01:05] <G3N3SIS> I cannot.
[01:05] <spx2> ompaul toshiba satellite m45 or a100 i'm not sure,but my mouse is canyon cn-msopt2
[01:05] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, oh.......
[01:06] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, OK
[01:06] <G3N3SIS> Yeah only the tribal sound.
[01:06] <ompaul> woro2006,  how does the machine decide who to give the port to?
[01:06] <eilker> i did a mistake and removed 55 packages, is there a command to install all packages in /var/cache/apt/archives
[01:06] <Elda> I tried a few different version before Ubuntu but so far Ubuntu is my favorite hehe
[01:06] <ivanhoe> hello to all
[01:06] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, ...ok... so what can you hear?
[01:06] <eyalw> Elda: may i ask you another Q?
[01:06] <G3N3SIS> Just the tribal sound on boot up and logout.
[01:06] <G3N3SIS> Nothing else.
[01:06] <ivanhoe> i search a irc chat from mysql
[01:06] <woro2006> ompaul, can't i just edit it in configuration files
[01:06] <Elda> Sure, not sure if I have the answer though :S
[01:07] <G3N3SIS> The volume control is muted, I can't turn it up because it says either I don't have GStreamer plugins and or devices.
[01:07] <ompaul> woro2006, ehh and the rest of the world will know which one to deal with - use postfix for multiple domains it just works :)
[01:07] <usr13> could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resorce temporarily unavalible)  ???
[01:07] <javaJake> eilker, run "deb -i $(ls -1 /var/cache/apt/archives)"
[01:07] <spx2> javajake do you remember ever having problems with ubuntu when switching from X to some consle with CTRL+ALT+F1 or so ? i mean...does it stalls when does things are done ?
[01:07] <carlfk> what is the diff between memtest86 and 86+ ?
[01:07] <apokryphos> usr13: close anything using dpkg/apt. i.e. synaptic
[01:07] <usr13> (Tring to run apt-update)
[01:07] <ompaul> spx2, got that little green fitting? turn it into PS2 mouse?
[01:07] <javaJake> spx2, no, it would flicker a bit, but that's it.
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[01:07] <Elda> eyalw: Sure, not sure if I have the answer though :S
[01:07] <eyalw> Elda: I installed ubuntu, and got the keyboard setting right, (English + Heberew) but I cant recall when or why it changed and now support only one at a time
[01:07] <ivanhoe> anyone speak spanish?
[01:07] <javaJake> spx2, yea, stall slightly while it flickered.
[01:07] <Rprp> Hi, does someone know how to open a file in gftp from the command line?
[01:07] <ivanhoe> nadie habla espaol?
[01:07] <javaJake> !spanish
[01:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about spanish - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:07] <spx2> ompaul what green ?
[01:07] <Elda> I have no idea :s
[01:08] <uruguaian> i'va q qustion... if i make the 'server' installation... what with the firewall?
[01:08] <ompaul> spx2, usb to ps2 converter
[01:08] <usr13> apokryphos: I dont have synaptic open
[01:08] <spx2> javajake no,i mean like totally freeze
[01:08] <ryanakca> when compiling a kernel, what option do you select to enable iptables
[01:08] <javaJake> spx2, no
[01:08] <carlfk> ivanhoe, /join #ubuntu-es
[01:08] <G3N3SIS> Hey, hey, I need sound.
[01:08] <ompaul> spx2,  came with the mouse in the box
[01:08] <Elda> Ive only been using Ubuntu for about a week in total time give or take a few days :/
[01:08] <eyalw> Elda: ctrl+shift just wont do it...
[01:08] <ryanakca> !firewall | uruguaian
[01:08] <ubotu> uruguaian: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[01:08] <apokryphos> usr13: you have a dpkg process running, or you're not root. Can't tell without the full output.
[01:08] <spx2> ompaul i don't have one right now,i'm trying to solve the problem without one...if it is possible
[01:08] <Elda> ctrl + shift does what?
[01:08] <ivanhoe> oh thnakyou man for irc chat
[01:08] <spx2> ompaul no i bought the mouse separately
[01:08] <carlfk> uruguaian, server is just a platform for installing servers - it just gets you a kernel, networking apt-get and a shell
[01:08] <eyalw> Elda: *srry, alt+shift
[01:08] <usr13> apokryphos: not sure... looking
[01:08] <eilker> javajake: it says command not found                    deb -i $(ls -1 /var/cache/apt/archives)
[01:08] <Elda> What do you mean?
[01:09] <Elda> What does alt+shift do?
[01:09] <ompaul> spx2, it comes with the mouse (in the same box as the mouse)
[01:09] <eyalw> Elda: usually it would switch layouts
[01:09] <javaJake> eilker, lol, I meant dpkg
[01:09] <Elda> Ah >.>
[01:09] <carlfk> uruguaian, so, there is no firewall
[01:09] <ompaul> spx2, see it fitted here  http://www1.canyon-tech.com/products/show.cfm/Peripherals/Accessories/Mouse/CN-MSOPT2
[01:09] <eyalw> Elda: u probebly use only 1 layout so u're not used to this
[01:09] <spx2> ompaul,oh i didn't have that in my box :(
[01:09] <hou5ton> How can I make the Win key on my laptop open up Synaptic?
[01:09] <uruguaian> ok
[01:09] <uruguaian> thanks
[01:09] <G3N3SIS> God, I need sound so bad.
[01:09] <usr13> Yes ok
[01:09] <G3N3SIS> I let 4 hours go to waste.
[01:09] <Elda> Yep
[01:10] <Elda> Just good old english
[01:10] <usr13> But the problem (really) is:
[01:10] <uruguaian> it is because, i need to configurate iptables to share conection..
[01:10] <eyalw> Elda: well, I'll jureney on in my quest for answers :)
[01:10] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, yea, sorry, try google. That's all I can say.
[01:10] <G3N3SIS> I think, by now, I should either decide to drop this distro and go to SuSE, or get it fixed
[01:10] <Elda> Good luck :)
[01:10] <eyalw> Elda: thanks again
[01:10] <Elda> No problem xD
[01:10] <FireCat> Can anyone tell me how to launch eclipse after installing the package?
[01:10] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, this is one of the worst channels for advanced tech support.
[01:10] <usr13> libopenal0  and  linux-doc  Says cannot install all available updates and lists  those two
[01:10] <kitche> FireCat: opne up a console and type eclipse
[01:10] <carlfk> uruguaian, i think the server supports it - may have to apt-get it - I have it on mine, not sure how it got there :)
[01:10] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, doesn't mean the distro's bad...
[01:10] <ompaul> G3N3SIS, maybe it is a matter of rebooting and then clicking on the little speaker on the top right hand corner of the desktop and you can check what feeds are on - add stuff via preferences
[01:11] <spx2> ompaul it is strange however that on other distro's like vector linux soho 5.1 it worked with no problem the touchpad and the mouse at the same time(like on windows) but here it seems not to work
[01:11] <usr13> so what is libopenal0 and linux-doc anyway?
[01:11] <ompaul> G3N3SIS, the guy who does alsa hacking on ubuntu spent a lot of time here
[01:11] <FireCat> kitche: Thaks, but I already tried that
[01:11] <spx2> ompaul this is my only problem,other than that i like allot ubuntu
[01:11] <usr13> anything I really need?
[01:11] <uruguaian> carlfk: ok, i been used it with firestarter.. but, in 'server'.. not.. :P
[01:11] <ryanakca> when compiling a kernel (in my case, 2.6.19), what option do you select to enable iptables (I'm in 'make menuconfig' at the moment...)?
[01:11] <kitche> FireCat: then your probably missing the binary
[01:11] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, lol, yea, double click on your speaker icon
[01:11] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, and check that no icons have an "X" over them in that window.
[01:11] <ompaul> spx2, if you want to solve it I suggest getting in close to your kernel and having a look at debugging the source
[01:11] <Elda> Sound is for sissies ;)
[01:12] <javaJake> Elda, haha
[01:12] <Xnthus> uruguaian, Have you tried FWBUILDER?
[01:12] <Elda> Then again Ive been deaf since 2000 so :p
[01:12] <uruguaian> Xnthus: not, what is it?
[01:12] <FireCat> kitche: I have u/usr/lib/eclipse and a host of other things
[01:12] <jumble> does ubuntu have a 2GB file size limit?
[01:12] <Cyllene> Hey all. How would one become a package manager for Ubuntu? That is to say, test and compile applications and add them to the repository?
[01:12] <javaJake> Elda, heheh... yea, that helps.
[01:12] <Cyllene> jumble: Depends on the filesystem
[01:12] <kitche> FireCat: look for eclipse in /usr/bin
[01:12] <blameless> jumble: thats usually a filesystem limitation
[01:12] <ryanakca> Cyllene: join #ubuntu-motu
[01:12] <jumble> ok, the system is formatted on ext3, i think.
[01:12] <FireCat> kitche: Nothing there
[01:12] <_GM_FrOdO_> r
[01:12] <usr13> Anyone know what libopenal0 and linux-doc  is ?
[01:12] <_GM_FrOdO_> :\
[01:12] <Cyllene> ryanakca: Thanks
[01:13] <kitche> FireCat: then you don't have the binary then
[01:13] <ompaul> jumble, I hope not cos I did a lot of ubuntu DVD downloads and burns over the last while
[01:13] <_GM_FrOdO_> now I have the command for mount and etc
[01:13] <_GM_FrOdO_> but
[01:13] <Xnthus> http://www.fwbuilder.org/
[01:13] <_GM_FrOdO_> when I type
[01:13] <javaJake> usr13, run "apt-cache show <name>" to find out
[01:13] <spx2> ompaul i do know how to code and debug,but that would be a tremendously big and difficult task to do and it would take too much effort compared to the outcome
[01:13] <FireCat> kitche: So the package is worthless then?
[01:13] <_GM_FrOdO_> thiago@thiago-desktop:~$ mount /dev/hda3/ on computer/
[01:13] <javaJake> spx2, I agree.
[01:13] <Elda> Though Im still going in circles trying to figure out how to make sure that Ubuntu is actually using my video card as it should :S
[01:13] <ompaul> spx2, get a ps2 mouse?
[01:13] <spx2> ompaul i would think there exists a simpler solution
[01:13] <_GM_FrOdO_> mount: root exclusive operation
[01:13] <[erisco] > I am trying to make a simple application that will run a command to open an SH file I have. Basically just a simple executable so that I do not have to go through the command line every time to run my SH file. How could I do this?
[01:13] <_GM_FrOdO_> and now? :\
[01:13] <kitche> FireCat: no its good you probably just didn't install eclipse fully did you install Eclipse-core?
=== guest15_ is now known as lophyte-
[01:13] <_GM_FrOdO_> this is the unique user in this computer, it's de root
[01:13] <javaJake> spx2, usb to ps2 converters aren't expensive.
[01:13] <jumble> a program im running that needs to generate a large file is generated a "Filze size limit exceeded (core dumped)" message at 2gb. im not sure where the source of the limitation is.
[01:13] <Elda> Installing KDE as it has a nifty control panel like thing
[01:14] <ryanakca> when compiling a kernel (in my case, 2.6.19), what option do you select to enable iptables (I'm in 'make menuconfig' at the moment...)?
[01:14] <spx2> ompaul i am verry affectious to my mouse,i have it for quite a while now
[01:14] <carlfk> jumble, what fs?
[01:14] <_GM_FrOdO_> someone can  help me?
[01:14] <_GM_FrOdO_> :\
[01:14] <ompaul> _GM_FrOdO_, please put all your thoughts on one line, it makes it easy for people to help you
[01:14] <Elda> Help you with what?
[01:14] <carlfk> jumble, I think fat is limited to 2g
[01:14] <_GM_FrOdO_> ompaul sorry...
[01:14] <eilker> is there a log for apt ?? to learning what i did , install and uninstall_?
[01:14] <uruguaian> Xnthus: i use Firestarer to share a conection, it is gui... but for a server i need use ir without guir.. FWbuilder can help me?
[01:14] <usr13> javaJake: apt-cache show ????
[01:14] <jumble> ext3, i think. is tha ta file system? thats what i think i remember seeing from the installation.
[01:14] <jumble> its not fat.
[01:14] <javaJake> ryanakca, if I remember, someone said you can use a config file to have your kernel configured just like the Ubuntu people did.
[01:14] <_GM_FrOdO_> when I try to mount a partition it say "only root can make this" and this account is the root account...
[01:15] <FireCat> kitche: Only the package that the how to said: nstall the packages eclipse-jdt, sun-java5-jre and tomcat5.5.
[01:15] <javaJake> usr13, yea... put the name of the package at the end of that
[01:15] <spx2> ompaul if i ever find a solution can i write an article about it and if so,where should i write it so that as much people as is possible find it usefull ?
[01:15] <_GM_FrOdO_> :(
[01:15] <Elda> well afk, going to work on my physics homework some more xD
[01:15] <carlfk> jumble, yeah, ext3 is a fs.  i forget which all has the 2g limit
[01:15] <usr13> got it
[01:15] <kitche> FireCat: yeah your missing Eclipse-core
[01:15] <_GM_FrOdO_> can someone help?
[01:15] <javaJake> usr13, well, libopenal0 doesn't have any info.
[01:15] <Xnthus> uruguaian, You can use FWBuilder on any PC, I use it on my main PC with gui, then just ssh the file it creates over and run it
[01:15] <mc44> _GM_FrOdO_: you need to use sudo
[01:15] <carlfk> jumbers, pretty sure my dapper ubuntu on ext3 handles 4.5 gig dvd images
[01:16] <_GM_FrOdO_> hmm
[01:16] <ompaul> spx2, well I think wiki.ubuntu.com is not a bad place for that, but frankly the easy option is buy one of those little things that make the usb a ps2 connection
[01:16] <_GM_FrOdO_> ohhhhhhhh
[01:16] <_GM_FrOdO_> ok!!!
[01:16] <uruguaian> Xnthus: thanks!.. i will try it.. now :D
[01:16] <_GM_FrOdO_> thx
[01:16] <ryanakca> javaJake: I don't want it configured like the ubuntu kernel... that's one of the reasons I'm compiling from source :)
[01:16] <Xnthus> uruguaian, That way, no gui needed on the firewall, but got the benefit of one to create the ruleset
[01:16] <carlfk> jumble, any networking stuff going on (like mounted over nfs/smb...)
[01:16] <ompaul> _GM_FrOdO_, please stop using enter in the place of a comma
[01:16] <javaJake> usr13, "OpenAL is a portable library for 3D spatialized audio." - that's libopenal0
[01:16] <usr13> javaJake: I wonder if I have some software that needs to be uninstalled?
[01:16] <javaJake> ryanakca, ah, I see
[01:16] <javaJake> usr13, oh, why?
[01:16] <uruguaian> Xnthus: nice, :)
[01:16] <jumble> um, i don think so. a fat32 partition is mounted into the devices, but im not using that one.
[01:17] <carlfk> ryanakca, what do you want to change?
[01:17] <Xnthus> uruguaian, The .fw file is the one you will want to run on the firewall...
[01:17] <jumble> is it possible that the limit is being imposed by something other than the file system?
[01:17] <DjBrix> can any one help-me!
[01:17] <DjBrix> the folowing packages ha unresolvable dependencies......
[01:17] <ryanakca> uruguaian: for your firewall, look at quicktables, it's the best tool out there (that I've used... and I messed around with various iptables frontends for a couple hours one day)
[01:17] <usr13> It's just that the "Software Updates" stalls and complains that those "two updates will be skipped"
[01:17] <carlfk> jumble, yes - you can use dd to create a 2.1 gig file.  I forget how.
[01:17] <ryanakca> carlfk: I already have all my settings, and I'm in 2.6.19... but I need to re-enable iptables...
[01:18] <jumble> thefile is being generated by a statistical software package called "R"
[01:18] <usr13> javaJake: Should we just ignore the error?
[01:18] <carlfk> ryanakca, um... so 'nothing' ?
[01:18] <ryanakca> carlfk: and iirc, iptables is a frontend to ipchains, but I don't see an option to enable it...
[01:18] <javaJake> usr13, Ah, yea, well, run sudo apt-get update in a terminal to see what's going on. That'll tell you.
[01:18] <DjBrix> Hi linuxers can you help-me?
[01:18] <ompaul> !ask
[01:18] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:18] <Carpe_Diem> hi people
[01:18] <DjBrix> how do i solve this? the folowing packages ha unresolvable dependencies......
[01:18] <kitche> ryanakca: iptables is the replacement for ipchains not a frontend
[01:18] <javaJake> usr13, it just means the upgrades require something extra, so it'll skip those. apt-get update'll tell you what you need.
[01:18] <ryanakca> kitche: kk
[01:18] <Carpe_Diem> what is the command for mount a partition?
[01:18] <Carpe_Diem> sudo mount...
[01:18] <javaJake> DjBrix, you need to tell us what the packages are.
[01:18] <Carpe_Diem> ????
[01:18] <ompaul> !enter
[01:18] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[01:18] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, mount
[01:18] <carlfk> Carpe_Diem, mount something somewhere
[01:19] <princemackenzie> Carpe_Diem, mount device location
[01:19] <Carpe_Diem> look it's right?
[01:19] <Carpe_Diem> oh
[01:19] <jumble> how would i distinguish a 2gb limit error message generated by the OS and one generated by another source?
[01:19] <Carpe_Diem> sudo mount /dev/hda3/ on computer/
[01:19] <Carpe_Diem> ?
[01:19] <ompaul> Carpe_Diem, mount -t TYPE(ext3/msdos) /from/here /to/there
[01:19] <matthew_> Carpe_Diem, sudo mount /dev/device
[01:19] <bogus> jest ktos z polski ?
[01:19] <matthew_> lol
[01:19] <ompaul> !pl
[01:19] <ubotu> Mozesz uzyskac pomoc w jezyku polskim na #ubuntu-pl
[01:19] <Carpe_Diem> hm........
[01:19] <bogus> dzikuj ;] 
[01:20] <ooswoosh> ompaul: how did u know the language ?
[01:20] <FireCat> kitche: Thank you, that made it very easy :)
[01:20] <DjBrix> javaJake: how can i solve it?
[01:20] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, mmm... well, remove the last "on computer/"
[01:20] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, just run "/dev/hda3"
[01:20] <carlfk> Carpe_Diem, the something is a device, not a dir - so /dev/hda3 - the somwhere is a mountpoint, or a dir
[01:20] <ompaul> ooswoosh,  >>polski<< kinda obvious :)
[01:20] <ooswoosh> ompaul: alright
[01:20] <DjBrix> javaJake:  ?
[01:20] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, I mean, "mount /dev/hda3" and tell me if that works
[01:20] <jumble> what is "samba"?
[01:20] <ooswoosh> ompaul: well spotted
[01:21] <javaJake> DjBrix, I need some output.
[01:21] <Carpe_Diem> ok java
[01:21] <Carpe_Diem> i go try
[01:21] <DjBrix> ok :)
[01:21] <carlfk> jumble, windows networking - samba.org
[01:21] <Carpe_Diem> say "only root can make this"
[01:21] <Carpe_Diem> I think I need use sudo
[01:21] <Carpe_Diem> no?
[01:21] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, yea. :P
[01:22] <Carpe_Diem> mount: o ponto de montagem none no existe
[01:22] <ooswoosh> Carpe_Diem: when u r not root add "sudo" at the beginning of the command
[01:22] <Carpe_Diem> the mount point don't exist
[01:22] <ompaul> Carpe_Diem, please put all your thoughts on one line -- the use of enter is very annoying after two or three words in a busy channel such as this thanks
[01:22] <Carpe_Diem> k ompaul :x
[01:23] <RxDx> Carpe_Diem, just use "sudo + command" by AXION, again =P
[01:23] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, alright, what does "cat /etc/fstab | grep hda3" say?
[01:23] <matthew_> Carpe_Diem, remember, you can (and should) start out messages to specific people with their username...instead of typing it out every time, you can start it, then hit tab.
[01:23] <usr13> javaJake: output of apt-get update ... See:http://pastebin.ca/265086
[01:23] <javaJake> RxDx, that isn't the issue
[01:23] <Carpe_Diem> # /dev/hda3
[01:23] <Carpe_Diem> thiago@thiago-desktop:~$
[01:23] <jumble> is it possible that the 2gb limit is imposed by the BASH shell?
[01:23] <carlfk> javaJake, why the pipe?  why not just grep hda3 /etc/fstab
[01:23] <carlfk> jumble, no.
[01:23] <Carpe_Diem> matthew_,  I know =p
[01:24] <jumble> bummer. i was hoping for an easy answer.
[01:24] <ArrenLex> matthew_: COOL! OMG I never knew that! THANK YOU
[01:24] <matthew_> Carpe_Diem, k, sorry...
[01:24] <DarkED> hey all, if i use gparted to resize my ntfs on ubuntu install, i should be okay so long as its 40-50% free space, right?
[01:24] <matthew_> ha ha, I knew it!
[01:24] <G3N3SIS> BREAKTHRU BREAKTHRU
[01:24] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, OK. Is /dev/hda3 an ext3 partition?
[01:24] <G3N3SIS> Javajake, I need you now!
[01:24] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, OOO!
[01:24] <Carpe_Diem> is
[01:24] <G3N3SIS> I did a lspci -v
[01:24] <G3N3SIS> and it picks up my card!
[01:24] <matthew_> I find it's better to treat everyone as if they don't know anything; that way it's easier to tell them what to do.
[01:24] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, OK, remove that line, and add this:
[01:25] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, ....ok.... that's, uh, great...
[01:25] <G3N3SIS> but... if i do a sudo modprobe snd- it doesn't pick anything up
[01:25] <r00t-fck> where do i get sftp?
[01:25] <javaJake> G3N3SIS, Oh
[01:25] <Carpe_Diem> ...
[01:25] <G3N3SIS> Still soundless, but it's not doing anythign.  Any ideas on useage?
[01:25] <usr13> apt-get update errors - See: http://pastebin.ca/265086
[01:25] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, Sorry, getting to you. :P
[01:25] <Carpe_Diem> oh ok
[01:25] <carlfk> jumble, dd if=/dev/zerro of=big.file count=2100000 bs=1000
[01:25] <Carpe_Diem> :)
[01:26] <jumble> pardon?
[01:26] <ArrenLex> carlfk: you mean zero?
[01:26] <carlfk> ArrenLex, oh yeah - I am a terible speller :)
[01:26] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, I believe this'll work: /dev/hda3 /media/hda3 ext3 auto 0 0
[01:26] <uruguaian> Xnthus: thanks for all :)
[01:26] <jumble> i dont understand what you're telling me to do... sorry...
[01:26] <javaJake> usr13, run "sudo apt-get update" and try again".
[01:26] <spx2> ompaul i'm currently researching the problem on the net
=== Deaigo83 is now known as Deaigo
[01:27] <carlfk> jumble, create a 2.1 gig file.  see if the os and fs support it.
[01:27] <javaJake> spx2, excellent! let me know how it goes!
[01:27] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, bash: /dev/hda3: Permisso negada
[01:27] <jumble> ok but you're saying i do that by typing that text into the terminal window?
[01:27] <matthew_> Carpe_Diem, try sudo
[01:27] <jumble> ok but you're saying i do that by typing that text into the terminal window?
[01:27] <Carpe_Diem> Don't have permission
[01:27] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, um, you need to use sudo.
[01:27] <carlfk> jumble, correct
[01:28] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, add the text I gave you to the end of /etc/fstab.
[01:28] <Carpe_Diem> I tried sudo /dev/hda3 /media/hda3 ext3 auto 0 0
[01:28] <matthew_> jumble, you might want to do sudo cfdisk /dev/whatever
[01:28] <Carpe_Diem> and nothing........
[01:28] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, Sorry, I wasn't clear
[01:28] <carlfk> jumble, only zero, not zerro :)
[01:28] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, run "sudo gedit /etc/fstab"
[01:28] <eilker> cant i show to adept a local repo ??? as /var/cache/apt/archives
[01:28] <matthew_> Carpe_Diem, you need to type sudo mount whatever
[01:28] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, and add that text to the end, save, and close.
[01:28] <javaJake> matthew_, that still isn't the issue
[01:28] <Carpe_Diem> happen nothing...
[01:28] <matthew_> javaJake, sorry
[01:29] <javaJake> matthew_, the issue is that he is running the text on the command line, when he needs to add that at the end of a file.
[01:29] <matthew_> ah, ok.
[01:29] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, sorry I'm a noob :P
[01:29] <spx2> javajake ofcourse
[01:29] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, OK, did you run "sudo gedit /etc/fstab"?
[01:29] <Carpe_Diem> yes
[01:29] <javaJake> OK
[01:29] <wikityler> when i used suse, i could open a window and log on as another user in that window, while still logged in as me in the background. I don't know what that's called, but can i do it in ubuntu?
[01:29] <javaJake> Did you get a window?
[01:29] <javaJake> With text?
[01:29] <Carpe_Diem> no.....
[01:29] <javaJake> Oh
[01:29] <javaJake> What happened?
[01:29] <Carpe_Diem> nothing.....
[01:30] <Carpe_Diem> a empty line behind the command
[01:30] <javaJake> wikityler, yea, in a terminal, run "login".
[01:30] <Carpe_Diem> oh........now the window appear
[01:30] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, yay.
[01:30] <jumble> carlfk, looks like it worked. so the 2gb limit is not being imposed by the file system.
[01:30] <spx2> ompaul , javajake if i wnat to find out if a certain device /dev/blah exists how do i do ? i mean ...if it is beeing used by someone or something
[01:30] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake,  the window appear now... fstab
[01:30] <matthew_> javaJake, Carpe_Diem , yay!!
[01:30] <Carpe_Diem> :P
[01:30] <javaJake> lol
[01:30] <ompaul> spx2, lsusb for you :)_
[01:31] <javaJake> OK, now add that text I gave you at the end of that.
[01:31] <javaJake> And save and close
[01:31] <usr13> javaJake: I've appended /etc/apt/soruces.list to:
[01:31] <usr13> http://pastebin.ca/265086
[01:31] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake,  /dev/hda3 /media/hda3 ext3 auto 0 0
[01:31] <carlfk> jumble, or the OS (which at one point I think Linux may have been limited
[01:31] <Carpe_Diem> this text?
[01:31] <javaJake> Yea
[01:31] <eilker> cant i show to adept a local repo ??? as /var/cache/apt/archives
[01:31] <matthew_> jumble, are you trying to make a >2 Gb swap?
[01:31] <jumble> ok,well i guess that is useful info, although i dont know how to locate the problem now, unfortunately.
[01:32] <eloquence_> can somebody help me with this? http://pastebin.ca/265091 I think there is a problem in the makefile adding an extra /
[01:32] <javaJake> usr13, oh, so sorry!!!!!! I meant "sudo apt-get upgrade"!!!!
[01:32] <nikin> i think the time to update to edgy has come for me, but apt-get dit-upgrade doesnot want to do that
[01:32] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake,  ok......and now?
[01:32] <jumble> no. im using a statistical software package called "R" and its doing bayesian estimation, which requires taking millions of draws from a statistical distribution which need to be stored in a big file.
[01:32] <nikin> any idead
[01:32] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, click the Save button, and close the window
[01:32] <carlfk> jumble, use the strings command and maybe grep to see if the "error message" is part of the program you are running
[01:32] <spx2> ompaul thx :)
[01:32] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, ok..........and now? :P
[01:32] <matthew_> jumble, ah, ok. I'm no help....
[01:32] <darrint> If I run crontab -e I get permission denied after editing the file. (on dapper) Is there something I can do to fix that?
[01:33] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, run "sudo mkdir /media/hda3"
[01:33] <jumble> carl, how do i do that? (or point me to a document that explains how)? sorry, i am still basically clueless on linux.
[01:33] <javaJake> darrint, sudo?
[01:33] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, right.....and??
[01:33] <Carpe_Diem> :D
[01:33] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, run "sudo mount /media/hda3"
[01:33] <darrint> javaJake: I want it to be in the user's crontab
[01:33] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, /dev/hda3'll appear in the /media/hda3 folder.
[01:33] <Carpe_Diem> mount: /dev/hda3 j montado ou /media/hda3 ocupado
[01:33] <javaJake> darrint, oh, OK. nvm
[01:33] <Carpe_Diem> .....
[01:34] <SilentWarrior> hi, i need help, problem is i want to install wireless conceptronic 54mb usb adapter, from a clean ubuntu 6.06 LTS 32bit, and i get a no file found exception for the "build" file
[01:34] <javaJake> Can you translate that into Enlgish? :P
[01:34] <javaJake> English*
[01:34] <Carpe_Diem> yes....
[01:34] <Kim^J> [FUN] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense/ASCII_cows[/FUN]

[01:34] <simmerz> how do i get around the problem of the updater in kubuntu when it wants to give configuration options via the dialog? it displays the dialog when i view the full progress, but it doesn't let me input anything
[01:34] <matthew_> javaJake, shouldn't "/media/hda3" be "/dev/hda3" ?
[01:34] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, OK, check the folder /media/hda3"
[01:34] <simmerz> this is using adept-manager
[01:34] <javaJake> matthew_, no, not necessarily
[01:34] <carlfk> jumble, then pipe that to less so you can see it all: carl@dell17:~$ strings /bin/dd |less
[01:34] <matthew_> javaJake, ok, wasn't sure...
[01:34] <Carpe_Diem> oh FINALLY!
[01:34] <Carpe_Diem> :X
[01:34] <javaJake> matthew_, I should know, since i've done this three thousand times on the livecd. :D
[01:35] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, lol
[01:35] <matthew_> lol
[01:35] <jumble> do i need to run the offending program again before i type that in?
[01:35] <javaJake> matthew_, I've literally got that fstab line memorized. :P
[01:35] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, and now how I move this hda3 for the "Computer" folder?
[01:35] <kbrooks> how do i turn on gnome-terminal menu?

[01:36] <Carpe_Diem> I need access media/hda3.....
[01:36] <javaJake> matthew_, I've had to use the livecd to recover stuff.
[01:36] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, Yep.
[01:36] <Carpe_Diem> what I make for this appear when I click in the "Computer" icon the desktop?
[01:36] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, you just want to get to the folder?
[01:36] <spx2> ompaul , javajake the same question for OHCI Host Controller
[01:37] <eilker> !lamp
[01:37] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[01:37] <matthew_> java, you use the ubuntu liveCD?!?! I like to use DSL...50 Mb distro w/ gui and other stuff...
[01:37] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, do you want to view the folder?
[01:37] <Carpe_Diem> yes
[01:37] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, see what's in /media/hda3?
[01:37] <matthew_> javaJake, I'll keep it on topic now...sorry

[01:42] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, OK, go to /media again (so you see hda3 int he window)
[01:42] <blanky> bruenig: lol okay
[01:42] <Carpe_Diem> yes
[01:42] <usr13> javaJake: I'm thinking something in sources.list should be removed or... not sure, but did you look at /etc/apt/soruces.list that I posted earlier?
[01:42] <nikin> Elda: yes, and you have to logout to GDM
[01:42] <nikin> or KDM
[01:42] <Elda> Okey
[01:42] <Elda> Well, then brb :s
[01:42] <DjBrix> any idea matthew_
[01:42] <javaJake> usr13, yea, and then I told you to run "sudo apt-get upgrade" :_)
[01:42] <Carpe_Diem> it's here, beautiful
[01:42] <Carpe_Diem> :P
[01:42] <Carpe_Diem> hahahah lol :D
[01:42] <roughtrader> how do I give myself write access to all mounts on my system?
[01:42] <spx2> does this sound familiar to anyone here - EHCI/OHCI Host Controller ?
[01:42] <javaJake> DjBrix, you NEED to post your output!!!
[01:43] <Eroick> roughtrader: use sudo
[01:43] <matthew_> DjBrix, uh, so apt-get update doesn't tell you what you need?
[01:43] <jrib> roughtrader: mount them properly.  What filesystem?
[01:43] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake,  ?
[01:43] <DjBrix> matthew_:  no it runs without problem
[01:43] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, OK, now right click the fodler
[01:43] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, ok
[01:43] <roughtrader> I have installed edgy on sda1
[01:43] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, Nvm, drag it over to the left.
[01:43] <roughtrader> i have mounted an additional drive sdb1
[01:43] <bruenig> blanky, did that work?
[01:43] <matthew_> DjBrix, nope, sorry, no clue...haven't really wrestled with dependencies before...
[01:43] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, below everything else.
[01:44] <jrib> roughtrader: right, but is that ext3, ntfs, fat?
[01:44] <roughtrader> instead of having to sudo to write to sdb1, I want to have automatic permission
[01:44] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, right click and drag? Oo
[01:44] <roughtrader> but I don't know how to set this up
[01:44] <blanky> bruenig: actually, i cd'd into the folder ant there's nothing there, is that normal?
[01:44] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, no no, nvm about that rightclick
[01:44] <roughtrader> ext3
[01:44] <Carpe_Diem> O.O
[01:44] <bruenig> blanky, if there is nothing in the trash it is
[01:44] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, just drag it below the folders you see to the left.
[01:44] <jrib> roughtrader: then just use permissions as you normally would with any other file
[01:44] <blanky> bruenig: no, when I cd into ~/.Trash, nothing there
[01:45] <roughtrader> jrib: can you give me an example?
[01:45] <blanky> bruenig: but when i open it in the little icon, theres things in there
[01:45] <matthew_> SilentWarrior, try sudo apt-get remove make, then sudo apt-get install make...
[01:45] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, and now?:
[01:45] <usr13> sources.list: See: http://pastebin.ca/265107
[01:45] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, do you see hda3 on the left now?
[01:45] <nikin> roughtrader change the permission of /media
[01:45] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, have a line like this ------------
[01:45] <sting3r> ubuntu and nepethes honeypot rock
[01:45] <usr13> javaJake: sources.list: See: http://pastebin.ca/265107
[01:45] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, you should see it in your Places menu now as well
[01:45] <matthew_> matthew_,
[01:45] <bruenig> blanky, that is not normal. What DE are you in?
[01:45] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, yea, that's it
[01:45] <jrib> roughtrader: sure, here is how you let everyone read write and execute:  sudo chmod 777 /mount/point   I'll have the bot send you info on permissions
[01:45] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, you want to drag below that.
[01:45] <blanky> bruenig: KDE
[01:45] <roughtrader> thanks jrib
[01:45] <jrib> !permissions > roughtrader
[01:46] <bruenig> blanky, I am not positive that is where the trash is in kde, I know that is where it is in gnome.
[01:46] <DjBrix> javaJake:  i did it in you private chat
[01:46] <jrib> roughtrader: depending on your want to do, you may want to change ownership of the mount point instead.  For that you would use 'chown'
[01:46] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, hm.....now when I click open /media directly
[01:46] <Carpe_Diem> :D
[01:46] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, it's it?
[01:46] <noelferreira> does anyone knows why firefox and thunderbird won't start in a fresh install of edgy?
[01:46] <roughtrader> yeah, I want to move ownership from administrator to roughtrader of all mounts
[01:46] <javaJake> usr13, you need to run "sudo apt-get upgrade" and tell me what it says. I know that your sources.list file is there, but I don't think we need to edit it for this to work.
[01:46] <blanky> bruenig: aahhh i understand now thanks
[01:47] <mikedoty> I'm trying to use a gamepad I just bought with the zsnes emulator.  It recognizes all of the button presses, but I can't seem to get it to respond to the d-pad.  Any ideas?
[01:47] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, does it say "hda3" where you dragged it?
[01:47] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, yes :P
[01:47] <matthew_> mikedoty, is there a config file that you can edit?
[01:47] <jrib> roughtrader: just   sudo chown roughtrader:roughtrader /path/to/somewhere   will give you ownership (and change the group too).  You are just editing the permissions on the mounted files basically
[01:47] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, but I already renamed xD
[01:47] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, when you click on that thing you dragged, it should open /media/hda3
[01:47] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, yes
[01:47] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, OK
[01:47] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, that's it, right?
[01:47] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, it's right?
[01:47] <Carpe_Diem> right!
[01:47] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, yea
[01:47] <Carpe_Diem> \o/
[01:47] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, lol...
[01:47] <mikedoty> I'm not sure about whether there's a config file
[01:48] <Carpe_Diem> :P
[01:48] <roughtrader> cool thanks jrib
[01:48] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, where are you from?
[01:48] <mikedoty> I'll try looking around for zsnes related tips first
[01:48] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, MA, USA.
[01:48] <Andypat10> what is the difference between xamame-x and xmame-sdl and which is better?
[01:48] <DjBrix> javaJake:  whatch you private chat!
[01:48] <matthew_> mikedoty, try looking under /etc for a config file for the emulator
[01:48] <DjBrix> javaJake:  iany shot?
[01:48] <DjBrix> javaJake: any idea?
[01:48] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, why when I try to copy a thing into HDA3 I can't?
[01:48] <usr13> javaJake: it says that the "followning ackages have been kept back:  libopenal0 linux-doc
[01:48] <javaJake> DjBrix, I'm not getting anything in private cha
[01:49] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, HDA3 it's a partition in fat32....
[01:49] <Carpe_Diem> not a folder
[01:49] <Carpe_Diem> :\
[01:49] <DjBrix> i send the code because it is to big
[01:49] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, oh, so hda3 is fat32!?
[01:49] <Carpe_Diem> yes it's
[01:49] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, oh, LOL
[01:49] <DjBrix> 20 lines i wont put it here is it to big javaJake
[01:49] <Carpe_Diem> what? :\
[01:49] <javaJake> DjBrix, ok, you need to goto pastebin.com
[01:49] <usr13> javaJake: also says:  "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
[01:49] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, well, you need to remove that line in /etc/fstab we created.
[01:50] <Carpe_Diem> -.-

[01:52] <tim167> gouki: what is 'cat'-ing a file?
[01:52] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, Maybe...
[01:52] <DjBrix> javaJake: ;)

[01:54] <Carpe_Diem> ompaul,  it's the first! :\
[01:54] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, well, when you format, as long as the partition itself doesn't change, you'll be fine.
[01:54] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, my windows partition appear correctly
[01:54] <ompaul> Carpe_Diem, ehh don't argue with me, it was not - and you can scroll back to the 50th minute
[01:54] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, ok, just don't change the partition type (fat32)
[01:55] <Carpe_Diem> javaJake, if I format this fat32 partition again, it will appear correctly?
[01:55] <noelferreira> anyone knows why firefox won't start in edgy?
[01:55] <javaJake> Carpe_Diem, yes
[01:55] <Carpe_Diem> ompaul, :x k

[02:38] <Ultimadark> Tomcat: It gets kind of grainy
[02:38] <ArrenLex> SilentWarrior: You will need the build-essential package and everything it depends on. Without a net connection, that's going to be hard.
[02:38] <noelferreira> edgy Tomcat_
[02:38] <Ultimadark> Tomcat: And the loading bar freezes

[02:43] <eq_> anybody know a program to convert .rm files to .3gp for cell phones?
[02:43] <Ultimadark> Tomcat: Do u think that this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=190133&highlight=Corrupted+screen could have anything to do with it?
[02:43] <spx2> gnomefreak ?
[02:43] <Tomcat_> Ultimadark: If your symptoms are the same, sure.
[02:44] <SuperQ> r00t__: sftp
[02:44] <midgetg0at> bah, no action at #winehq
[02:44] <spx2> gnomefreak ?
[02:44] <SilentWarrior> any other way to make the "make" command work, have build-essencials
[02:44] <SuperQ> suacy: tkdiff might work
[02:44] <lucas9000> anyone able to get flash working in edgy amd64?
[02:44] <Ultimadark> Tomcat_: Well, theyre not the same but my screen gets grainy at the end of the loading screen and I have a X850XT
[02:44] <r00t__> SuperQ,  its for loading . now how do i copy?
[02:44] <nickfish03> quick question
[02:44] <nickfish03> i dont need an internet connection to boot ubuntu live do i?
[02:45] <kbrooks> Any tips for getting 3d on a Intel 81815 (?) vid card
[02:45] <Tomcat_> lucas9000: It's possible by installing the ia32 libs and installing a 32bit Firefox... more on ubuntuforums or the wiki.
[02:45] <midgetg0at> nick....no, live just means you can use the os while installing.
[02:45] <Tomcat_> nickfish03: Correct.
[02:45] <SuperQ> r00t__: huh?
[02:45] <nickfish03> ok, thank you
[02:45] <r00t__> nothing
[02:45] <SuperQ> r00t__: sftp can work both send and receive
[02:45] <Tomcat_> Ultimadark: Well, you could try the solution from this thread, if there is one.
[02:45] <lucas9000> tomcat: i saw that but wasn't sure if there's a way to do it while staying 64 bit, if you will
[02:46] <G3N3SIS> Guys, I need major help right now. I have seen people being helped for hours, and all I'm asking for is like 5 minutes of attention on my problem.  Can someone please help me get sound?  I
[02:46] <r00t__> SuperQ, but its in terminal . and terminal need command . and what is the command?
[02:46] <G3N3SIS> 'm getting pissed, and I think i'm gonna go to SuSE 10.1
[02:46] <Tomcat_> lucas9000: Sure, but your browser won't be 64 bit... it will be a 32bit browser on a 64bit OS, and so Flash 32bit will run.
[02:46] <kbrooks> Can someone plz gimme some help?
[02:46] <lucas9000> ok ty tomcat
[02:46] <ArrenLex> lucas9000: If you don't want to install 32-bit firefox in a chroot, try nspluginwrapper.
[02:46] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: Well, give us some info. What card, what have you tried, what are the problems?
[02:46] <SuperQ> r00t__: huh?
[02:46] <SuperQ> r00t__: get and put?
[02:46] <lucas9000> arren: i will search the forums for that, ty

[02:47] <G3N3SIS> I am having Sound Problems, can anyone assist me?
[02:47] <kbrooks> G3N3SIS: don't demand help!
[02:47] <SuperQ> r00t__: man sftp
[02:47] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: But then, Open Source is about choice, so if you want to use SuSE, that's your decision. ;)
[02:47] <r00t__> then ?
[02:47] <kbrooks> G3N3SIS: stop repeating. Tomcat_ offered help
[02:47] <G3N3SIS> did he?
[02:47] <r00t__> SuperQ,  then ? i type password
[02:47] <kbrooks> G3N3SIS: yes.
[02:47] <r00t__> then how do i copy
[02:47] <G3N3SIS> Oh didn't see that sorry.
[02:47] <suacy> which is the nicest graphical diff?
[02:47] <SuperQ> r00t__: read the man page
[02:47] <txfirehawk> how do i see the new hard drive i installed?
[02:47] <r00t__> SuperQ,  if you dont know about it its ok
[02:47] <r00t__> what page ?
[02:47] <r00t__> huh?
[02:47] <SuperQ> r00t__: man sftp

[02:48] <G3N3SIS> Alright, well I have a VIA 8237.  It works on XP, fails on Ubuntu.  I love Ubuntu, just I need sound to function.
[02:48] <lucas9000> oops lol
[02:48] <Tomcat_> noelferreira: I still don't know where you got Firefox/Thunderbird and what your console output/problems are...
[02:48] <kbrooks> SuperQ: wrong command
[02:48] <SuperQ> r00t: http://www.eos.ncsu.edu/remoteaccess/man/sftp.html
[02:48] <G3N3SIS> Originally it started by me being able to only hear the tribal sound on login.  Now I can't even hear that.
[02:48] <kbrooks> r00t__: scp is the command. man page: man scp
[02:48] <noelferreira> i just use a fresh edgy install and i get no output Tomcat_
[02:48] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: Settings in Prefs=>Sound correct?
[02:48] <G3N3SIS> I did some file editing, then it stopped, so I replaced those files back to normal how they were before, and I reupdated the modules, downloaded all the GStreamer plugins.
[02:48] <G3N3SIS> It's not picking up my card.
[02:48] <noelferreira> process goest to sleep Tomcat_
[02:49] <SuperQ> kbrooks: either sftp or scp work
[02:49] <G3N3SIS> Though, when I cat /proc/asound/cards it picks it up, and infact tells me exactly what it is.
[02:49] <justin_> Where is the gconf file again? -- /etc/???
[02:49] <SuperQ> kbrooks: the sftp protocol extention is more efficient afaik
[02:49] <G3N3SIS> I can use Alsa, and nothing is muted.  I can't however use Gnome-Mixer
[02:49] <r00t__> kbrooks, i am using put :P
[02:49] <Tomcat_> justin_: ~/.gconf-2 or something. In your home.

[02:50] <SuperQ> hahahaha.. eggie!
[02:50] <SilentWarrior> any other way to make the "make" command work, have build-essencials
[02:50] <G3N3SIS> Would I have to put my file in any special spot?
[02:50] <justin_> Tomcat_: No, I edited something to add XGL and it was in /etc .. but I forget where -- oh my
[02:50] <kbrooks> SuperQ: don't tease him like that
[02:50] <justin_> Because now my X is nothing but gibberish.. heh

[02:51] <txfirehawk> anyone?  i cant seem to locate my 2nd physical hdd in the gui
[02:51] <Tomcat_> SilentWarrior: make works if you have build-essential
[02:51] <suacy> is there a way to install custom modules without use module-assistant?
[02:51] <ProN00b> is there something like kuake for gnome ?
[02:51] <justin_> Tomcat_: Nope not that either I know where that is.. maybe it is in X11 though,let me see
[02:51] <G3N3SIS> Yeah, it gets me a whole bunch of beeps
[02:51] <SilentWarrior> tomcat_ see the link i gave, maybe its a diferent problem, but i am new and cant get to it
[02:51] <Tomcat_> SilentWarrior: You need the linux-headers-<something> package for that.
[02:51] <r00t__> and file uploaded . thank you pplz
[02:52] <Pelo> SilentWarrior,   you're missing dependecies,   rund ./configure first to know what dependencies you are missing
[02:52] <SilentWarrior> tomcat_  how ?
[02:52] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: Nope, just cat it to the sound device.
[02:52] <justin_> Well.. is there a way to search for files in console?
[02:52] <G3N3SIS> how would I do that?
[02:52] <Tomcat_> SilentWarrior: Download linux-headers-2.6.17-10 and all dependencies, copy it to the machine, install it.
[02:52] <blameless> justin_: locate or find
[02:52] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: As I said, "cat <soundfile> >/dev/dsp"
[02:53] <justin_> blameless: ok
[02:53] <txfirehawk> can anyone help me locate my new hdd?
[02:53] <txfirehawk> i dont see it in the file manager
[02:53] <G3N3SIS> I did that, but I don't hear anything.
[02:54] <kbrooks> CAN SOMEONE HELP ME OUT??????????????/
[02:54] <Tomcat_> txfirehawk: Install gparted and look for it there. You have to put the device into /etc/fstab to see it.
[02:54] <kbrooks> look. i want 3d on my intel 82815. that's all i want.'
[02:54] <Pelo> kbrooks,  someone will help you OUT in a second
[02:54] <G3N3SIS> all it says is root@root - desktop:/home/*****# cat song.wav >/dev/dsp
[02:54] <blameless> why bother?  the 815 is so underpowered anyway
[02:54] <jrib> txfirehawk: is it listed if you type 'sudo fdisk -l'?
[02:54] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: And what output from the sound card?
[02:55] <G3N3SIS> How would I find that out?
[02:55] <Pelo> kbrooks,  what is your problem ?

[03:09] <Tomcat_> robotgeek: So, is it fixed? You usually need a terminal with sudo capabilities, but I'm not so sure about that...
[03:09] <G3N3SIS> This time no mad beepage, but it's stil quiet
[03:10] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: Mad beepage? Did you forget the '>' symbol before "/dev/dsp"?
[03:10] <robotgeek> Tomcat_: yes, i had suggested the same thing to him, but it did not kill the timestamp till he opened another window
[03:10] <G3N3SIS> nope, it's there
[03:10] <SilentWarrior> tomcat_ cant find it on cd nor the net, only other stuff related to it
[03:10] <Ron> hey guy
[03:10] <Ron> s
[03:10] <Tomcat_> SilentWarrior: It's available in my install... should be somewhere...
[03:10] <Ron> I'd like to disable CPU freq. scaling when on AC power, any clues
[03:10] <Ron> ?
[03:10] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: "lsmod | grep snd-via" again?
[03:11] <BadKitty> Hi folks!
[03:11] <SilentWarrior> tomcat_ in mine too, but it needs to download off the net, and i dont have net on that pc
[03:11] <SilentWarrior> tomcat_ i am trying to install the net card drivers xD
[03:11] <Tomcat_> SilentWarrior: In that case, find the file, download it somewhere else and then copy it over... no other way. :)
[03:11] <BadKitty> Does anyone know if a belkin router would keep a log file about who had logged into the router?
[03:12] <Pelo> Ron,  I assume you checked the power management options in system > admin ?   then check the forum
[03:12] <G3N3SIS> Yup, nothing Tomcat_
[03:12] <Tomcat_> BadKitty: Check the web interface, shouldn't it have some option for that?
[03:12] <minerale> what's the default audio device in ubuntu? "Alsa", "esd", "oss" ?
[03:12] <Pelo> minerale,  alsa
[03:12] <con-man> om
[03:12] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: "sudo modprobe -v snd-via82xx", output?
[03:12] <BadKitty> Tomcat: No i can't find it
[03:13] <Tomcat_> minerale: esd I think.
[03:13] <con-man> i am unable to install ati drivers on edgy. it keeps saying unknown architecture
[03:13] <BadKitty> It has a list of CURRENT users, but not a log that I can see
[03:13] <Tomcat_> BadKitty: In that case, I guess not. ;)
[03:13] <Tomcat_> con-man: Are you using the official packages?
[03:13] <G3N3SIS> Nothing TC

=== hantoo is now known as hantu
[03:14] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: :-( Sorry, I'm out of ideas now... it should load the driver, but it doesn't... it doesn't say what's wrong... weird.
[03:14] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: Try "dmesg | grep snd-via"...
[03:14] <minerale> pelo: where can I read about the difference of the video outputs: "X11, xv, gl"
[03:15] <G3N3SIS> nothing.
[03:15] <Pelo> minerale,  I do not know
[03:15] <Jural> Question for forcing transparency on a window with beryl what do I use, I belive XGL b4 was alt+scrollwheel
[03:15] <con-man> thanks ubotu
[03:15] <con-man> i <3 bots
[03:15] <Tomcat_> G3N3SIS: Sorry then... no idea. :\
[03:15] <G3N3SIS> screw this, i'm gonna attempt a reinstall.
[03:15] <Tomcat_> Jural: Same, Alt+Scroll
[03:15] <G3N3SIS> If that fails well ugh
[03:15] <justin_> So does anyone know where X's logfile is kept? -- for a specific user..
[03:15] <jerp> justin, https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bugs
[03:16] <SilentWarrior> i think i might just crash ubuntu, wtf
[03:16] <justin_> jerp: That is X bugs
[03:16] <justin_> :P
[03:16] <Tomcat_> justin_: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[03:16] <justin_> ahhh
[03:16] <Pelo> justin_ there is a logviewer in the admin menu
[03:16] <justin_> thanks Tomcat_
[03:16] <Tomcat_> justin_: Xorg runs on root, so it will be only there.
[03:16] <justin_> Pelo: Would be nice if I could actually see it, I can't actually get into X :)
[03:16] <Tomcat_> justin_: Look for (EE) lines in there... that will show what's wrong.
[03:17] <minerale> where can I read about the difference of the video outputs: "X11, xv, gl"
[03:17] <minerale> (just trying to decide what settings to put for mplayer )
[03:17] <Pelo> minerale,  the setting for what y ou are using , most likely  X11
[03:18] <Pelo> justin_,    /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[03:19] <G3N3SIS> Tomcat_ still there?  I'm in the install live cd and I hear sound perfectly fine.
[03:19] <G3N3SIS> I think it was just an install error / bug.
[03:20] <G3N3SIS> I should get to reinstalling now, to enjoy Linux in it's prime!
[03:21] <justin_> "attempting to re-init radeon hardware" and "insufficient" memory for hardare cursor.. when I try to run Beryl, it flash like 2 times and goes right back to GDM.. :( -- the info for the "re-init radeon" is "II" and "WW" for the mouse problem ... what could it be?
[03:22] <racarter> how do you add a samba share?
[03:23] <britt> 'smbmount //SERVER/share /media/foo'
[03:23] <Pelo> justin_,  sound like a problem for  #xgl
[03:23] <killown> how I do to enable direct render for may card fx500 ?
[03:24] <knight> hi how can i reduce in any application without reducing system sound?
[03:24] <SpacePuppy> killown: is that a gforce card?
[03:24] <justin_> knight: If you take down master sound with all apps, it is probably set to OSS instead of ALSA..
=== [1] surferdude is now known as surferdude
[03:24] <SilentWarrior> tomcat_ hi, downloaded, installed, now it gives the error i had before, the number 2.... Error 2
[03:24] <killown> SpacePuppy yes

[03:25] <sigp239> how do I fix it?
[03:25] <txfirehawk> how do i give vncserver a password for remote login?
[03:25] <hybrid> txfirehawk: it should be your user login
[03:26] <Tomcat_> SilentWarrior: Sorry, no idea... maybe there's info in the READMEs that came with the source, but it should work somehow...
[03:26] <txfirehawk> let me try, thank you
[03:26] <ski-worklap> wtf, totem can't play an mp3 i give it, says it doesn't have the necessary codecs?

[03:26] <DarkED> Uh, hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu and when i use partition magic to resize my ntfs partition it gives me "Too many errors" and won't do the resize
[03:26] <justin_> Last small question..
[03:27] <BadKitty> DarkED: Is there anything on the drive that you must keep?
[03:27] <DarkED> So i did a chkdsk and it found a bunch of errors and fixed them. goody. so i tried pm again and it gave the same error...
[03:27] <justin_> Do you need compiz to use Beryl? - or does XGL work regardless of which one you choose?
[03:27] <DarkED> BadKitty: yep, LOTS of stuff =/.
[03:27] <SilentWarrior> anyone has wireless usb card running on ubuntu ?
[03:27] <chris_> can anyone help me with an ntfs problem?
[03:27] <sigp239> why do sounds mess-up sometimes?  like there will be a desktop beep or whatever, but it will keep repeating over and over again/
[03:27] <knight> justin_, but it doesnt work
[03:27] <hybrid> SilentWarrior: which card?
[03:27] <ski-worklap> hybrid, why would i use totem when mplayer supports justabout everything? (not a flame, just curious)(
[03:27] <nolimitsoya> !wifi | SilentWarrior

[03:27] <hybrid> chris_: if you ask
[03:27] <knight> justin_, could you tell how to do?
[03:27] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | SilentWarrior
[03:27] <ubotu> SilentWarrior: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:27] <BadKitty> DarkED: Well thats no good. My only suggestion is to copy your information to another disk, and then zero out your drive, reinstall and then copy back over
[03:28] <hybrid> ski-worklap: you asked, i preffer mplayer as well, compiled but thats me
[03:28] <BadKitty> DarkEd: Yah thats a problem
[03:28] <britt> i need for a console, like tty4 (or ttyS1) to automatically login
[03:28] <DarkED> BadKitty: so i should just copy everything and pop the windows disc in and deep format it?
[03:28] <ski-worklap> hybrid, right, thanks
[03:28] <ski-worklap> hmm, is there no w32codecs package for ubuntu?
[03:28] <hybrid> britt: change your run level to 3
[03:28] <britt> is there anyway i can do that in /etc/event.d (i use upstart)
[03:28] <hybrid> ski-worklap: ppc or x86?
[03:28] <ski-worklap> (even in multiverse)
[03:28] <ski-worklap> x86
[03:28] <SilentWarrior> thing is...cant solve the problem for the general question, so, would ask for the especific one from someone who already installed same driver has i need to install
[03:28] <BadKitty> DarkED. I think you may have to actually zero out your disk. Is it a WD, Maxtor, Seagate?
[03:28] <DarkED> hmm well okay, if its bad sectors will a low-lvl format help that?
[03:28] <hybrid> ski-worklap: there should be
[03:29] <knight> justin_, ive changed setting to alsa in xmms and mplayer still if i change sound of one other is affected
[03:29] <DarkED> BadKitty
[03:29] <britt> hybrid: in the indivdual entry for the console, i didnt know each console could change runlevels
[03:29] <DarkED> sorry...
[03:29] <ski-worklap> i get "it's referred to by another package, but has no installation candidate"
[03:29] <txfirehawk> hybrid,   - no dice, i tried my user password
[03:29] <ski-worklap> which is weird
[03:29] <DarkED> BadKitty: its a laptop drive, 60gig Hitachi/IBM travelstar
[03:29] <SilentWarrior> hybrid conceptronics 54 mb usb adapter

[03:30] <chris_> hybrid: my slave ntfs drive is known as hdb, but when i try to mount it, it says invalid argument?
[03:30] <hybrid> SilentWarrior: read up on ndiswrapper and it should work out
[03:30] <matthew_> disk kill or killdisk...something like that will zero out your drive and then write randomness over the zeroes
[03:30] <hybrid> chris_: how are you mounting i?
[03:31] <jrib> ski-worklap: which sections?
[03:31] <BadKitty> DarkED. I'v only had to do it a few times. My disc came with a disk to do it. it was Maxblast for a maxtor drive... there should be some different software for you IBM disk
[03:31] <ski-worklap> ah
[03:31] <chris_> hybrid: i've tried both ntfsmount and the built in ubuntu mount
[03:31] <ski-worklap> jrib, yeah i just had the one for flash, changing to all. thankx
[03:31] <DarkED> BadKitty: Oh... nah, this drive came with my laptop, so I didn't get a cd for it... crap
[03:31] <jrib> ski-worklap: np
[03:31] <sigp239> why do sounds mess-up sometimes?  like there will be a desktop beep or whatever, but it will keep repeating over and over again/
[03:31] <DarkED> See, this is why I hate linux on laptops, its a complete crapshoot
[03:31] <ankan_> excuse me....how do I get my dapper to work with my new Samsung Digimax digital camera...when I connect it...it tries to load up its own drivers but gives an error - An error occurred in the io-library ('Unspecified error'): Could not query kernel driver of device.
[03:32] <DarkED> if your laptop came with xp yer pretty much screwed...
[03:32] <BadKitty> DarkED: Well you might try a full reformat that could work too, did you just to a quick format/
[03:32] <hybrid> chris_: is it in your fstab?
[03:32] <loxety> greetings
[03:32] <DarkED> BadKitty: last time I reinstalled XP i didnt even do a format, just reinstalled over the old XP to keep files...
[03:32] <Pelo> ankan_,  look up your camera model number in the forum, someone may already have posted a solution
[03:32] <BadKitty> DarkED: Nah mine came with winXp and it worked great... actually my laptop just got stolen
[03:33] <DarkED> BadKitty: im sorry to hear that for you, my GOOD laptop just died so i know how you are feeling =(
[03:33] <chris_> hybrid: how do i go about finding that? im new at viewing ntfs on linux
[03:33] <knight> do any1 know how to change sound of apps without affecting other?
[03:33] <BadKitty> DarkED: does the drive still boot though
[03:33] <ankan_> Pelo: i will try that..thnks
[03:33] <DarkED> BadKitty: Yep, im in winxp on this drive right now
[03:33] <DarkED> everything seems to work a-ok

[03:47] <justin_> Apps start in 1 second compared to 8-9
[03:47] <nolimitsoya> justin_, that mesa stuff is software opengl. no wonder its slow ;)
[03:47] <dee7o> hey guys it's my first day using ubuntu and for some reason i have no sound. i think my dvd drive isn't working either
[03:47] <zoidberg> nolimitsoya: i did that and i get this error "-bash: ./pandora.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory"
[03:47] <matthew_> justin_, lol
[03:47] <dee7o> can anyone give me a hand because i am totally unfamiliar with it

[03:47] <justin_> thanks guys.
[03:48] <matthew_> dee7o, hello...what's the problem?
[03:48] <Lam_> !newsgroup
[03:48] <ubotu> There are Ubuntu newsgroups via NNTP at news.gmane.org
[03:48] <dee7o> matthew as i tell u i can get my sound card working and i think my dvd drive might also be undetected
[03:48] <zoidberg> hybrid:i still cant get the .sh file to run
[03:48] <matthew_> dee7o, bad soundcard, hmm?
[03:48] <hybrid> hmm weird
[03:48] <dee7o> i am using a virtual machine to run the os but i dont know if that could be a problem
[03:49] <zoidberg> hybrid: i did sudo -i, and i did ./file.sh and it says no permission
[03:49] <dee7o> the sound is still working fine on my host os
[03:49] <hybrid> brb i need to find my cell
[03:49] <matthew_> dee7o, are you using qemu or what?
[03:49] <nolimitsoya> dee7o, that could be it :)
[03:49] <G3N3SIS> Anyone without sound ?
[03:49] <G3N3SIS> I think I know your answer!
[03:49] <G3N3SIS> It works for me now so.
[03:49] <dee7o> i actually dont know what qemu is sorry
[03:49] <matthew_> dee7o, nolimitsoya has it right
[03:49] <nolimitsoya> dee7o, boot the live cd and see if it works :)
[03:49] <billytwowilly> If I want dpkg to try and fix partially installed packages how do I do that?
[03:49] <dee7o> i did that too
[03:49] <dee7o> no sound :)
[03:49] <Lam_> what's a good newsgroups client? preferably one that is QT based, but doesn't have to be
[03:50] <matthew_> billytwowilly, sudo dpkg --configure -a?
[03:50] <dee7o> and i cant mount anything to the dvd drive
[03:50] <matthew_> billytwowilly, w/o the question mark....
[03:50] <matthew_> billytwowilly, not totally sure about that, though
[03:50] <billytwowilly> matthew_: that appears to be it. thanks.
[03:50] <jack|ass> If I try to run a 32-bit app on a 64-bit kernel, what is likely to happen?
[03:51] <jack|ass> is it going to run properly, just in 32-bit mode?   Or am I better off staying with 32-bit kernel if that's what the majority of my applications run in?
[03:51] <dee7o> when i come to click on the top right sound icon it tells me gstreamer and/or devices not found
[03:51] <matthew_> billytwowilly, no prob
[03:52] <dee7o> ?
[03:52] <billytwowilly> how do I unlock /var/cache/debconf/config.dat ?
[03:52] <nolimitsoya> jack|ass, id say stick with 32bit if you want averything to be as smooth as possible :)
[03:52] <Dreamglider> and again, when i play videos in fullscreen i get a lot of horisontal lines, this is only in fullscreen mode. laptop is Intel P4 3GHz, 1gb ram, and GeForce FX Go6500 grapic card. can anyone assist?

[03:52] <matthew_> billytwowilly, you're gonna have to ask someone else for that one...I've got no idea...:)

[03:59] <ethos_> This is my dilemma:  I follow the instructions here: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/S3switch#Usage and it says to apply this patch because yes I get the segmentation fault.  It doesn't say how to apply the patch though, it looks like code to me.  I'm relatively new to Linux.
[04:00] <txfirehawk> jerp that is what I am looking for. there is nothing called prefs on the menu  =/   I am using xforce, would that be the problem?

[04:00] <Dreamglider> but back to my problem, does anyone know how i can fix it ?

[04:01] <jerp> prefs is standard in the installation not only should it be in that menu but it should be checked as default
[04:01] <Elda> Well, my apologies as I just came in.  But I am not sure on that one, perhaps check your refresh? :x
[04:01] <txfirehawk> well that is where i am stuck.
[04:02] <jerp> many times it's customary to reinstall under certain circumstances this would be a good sign that it's called for
[04:02] <txfirehawk> im still pretty new as well
[04:02] <txfirehawk> i would rather not do that, i have a lot set up already  =/
[04:02] <txfirehawk> ill keep looking I guess

[04:36] <gbv22> jrib: yeah..i guess....gaming is the only thing.....pls tell me something..i was talking to some of my friends..and they feel that fedora is a better distribution...what are your views?
[04:37] <txfirehawk> jerp it asked for my password and then that was it.   it (pref) is still not on any menu.
[04:37] <seth88j> Fedora is way smoother
[04:37] <gbv22> in what way seth?
[04:37] <php-freak_> kitche: you there?
[04:37] <linuxnewb> i am looking for mail server
[04:37] <jrib> gbv22: I like debian a lot.  But it is all preference.  I would try both out and see what you like more
[04:37] <php-freak_> Any one good with the command line ftp app. by ubuntu?
[04:37] <seth88j> On my machine it is just more snapier, running gnome
[04:37] <php-freak_> Need an expert?
[04:38] <kitche> php-freak_: yeah was reading the ftp man page
[04:38] <linuxnewb> any one run mail server here
[04:38] <php-freak_> i see
[04:38] <seth88j> Fedora is a big download
[04:38] <php-freak_> kitche: what'd you find out?
[04:38] <seth88j> Hey guys anybody here listen to black flag?
[04:38] <gbv22> jrib: i see....which desktop env is more popular...kde or gnome...(pls forgive me if im being too generic)
[04:39] <seth88j> Peace
[04:39] <linuxnewb> no one here run server
[04:39] <kitche> php-freak_: not a lot the man page doesn't have anything about uploading directories if that's what your trying to do
[04:39] <jerp> txfire, hmm, ok, I'm in gnome and I did have xubuntu on the dapper but I have forgotten where that is,  I must say I apologise for not asking what you were using before we started.   (sheepish grin)
[04:40] <night17> gbv22: don't forget xfce :] 
[04:40] <jrib> gbv22: heh this is again personal preference, you should just try both.  kde gives you a lot more options (some feel too much).  GNOME likes to keep things simple (some feel too much)
[04:40] <php-freak_> Ktiche: im not trying to upload a directory? Why ask such question. I'm trying to upload the file from that directory.
[04:40] <txfirehawk> its ok, i have been looking on the ubuntu forums and i see pref listed on the menu but it is not on mine.   is there a command to launch the app?
[04:40] <gbv22> night17:which distribution uses xfce?
[04:40] <kitche> php-freak_: then cd to that directory on your local machine and up load it
[04:41] <jrib> gbv22: GNOME is probably more popular on ubuntu though since it is default
[04:41] <kitche> gbv22: xubuntu but you cna install it with ubuntu also
[04:41] <jerp> txfire, do you have the menu that is on the desktop? or is it in the deskbar?
[04:41] <gbv22> jrib:ok..i will do that..can i dual boot two linux systems
[04:41] <jerp> like, click the mouse on the wallpaper and the menu shows
[04:41] <gbv22> kitche: i can dual boot xubuntu and ubunty?
[04:42] <kitche> gbv22: you cna do sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop then you will have xfce
[04:42] <txfirehawk> deskbar
[04:42] <jrib> gbv22: yes you can.  You could have both fedora and ubuntu on your system.  As far as having both GNOME and KDE on ubuntu, you can just install kubuntu-desktop package after installing ubuntu.  Then at the login screen, the "options" button lets you switch
[04:43] <xarq> what tv card is recommended for ubuntu?
[04:43] <jerp> ok, I'm baffled, in the dapper I had the menu was on the desktop
[04:43] <xarq> usb or otherwise
[04:43] <txfirehawk> i am using an old all in woder
[04:43] <txfirehawk> wonder*
[04:44] <jrib> txfirehawk: what are you trying to launch?
[04:44] <txfirehawk> im trying to set up vnc
[04:44] <jerp> he is missing the preferences
[04:44] <txfirehawk> ive been searching the forums
[04:44] <txfirehawk> for 2 days lol
[04:44] <txfirehawk> got it running
[04:44] <txfirehawk> but wont accept the pass
[04:45] <txfirehawk> so i am not sure how to launch the app to reset/ configure a password
[04:45] <SupremeBeing> would anyone care to assist me with fglrx?  I can wait =)
[04:45] <jrib> !enter | txfirehawk
[04:45] <ubotu> txfirehawk: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[04:45] <txfirehawk> ah sorry
[04:45] <jrib> txfirehawk: you are using your user password?
[04:45] <txfirehawk> i am logged in as a user
[04:46] <jrib> txfirehawk: does synaptic work?
[04:46] <txfirehawk> yes
[04:46] <txfirehawk> i have been using it
[04:46] <txfirehawk> xubuntu-desktop is installed
[04:46] <php-freak_> this channel sucks 885 people, and no support
[04:47] <php-freak_> #linux
[04:47] <pablo_> can anyone give me some hints on installing freeglut3-dev? (broken dependency with libgl1-mesa-dev)
[04:47] <SupremeBeing> php-freak_: that's not a good way to get support =)
[04:47] <jrib> txfirehawk: ok we are talking about system > administration > remote desktop?  "vino-preferences" command?
[04:47] <php-freak_> lol
[04:47] <php-freak_> wasn't like I was getting it anyways
[04:47] <kitche> php-freak_: to bad #linux will tell you to just come here
[04:47] <SupremeBeing> php-freak_: that's true
[04:47] <jrib> s/administration/preferences
[04:47] <php-freak_> its just ridicules there is 885 people in here, and not 1 person can answer a question lol.
[04:47] <bonggnu> hi,  my webserver (apache2) cant execute a setup.php file, it wants to open with a text editor
[04:48] <kitche> php-freak_: did you even try to upload that file fromt he directory that the file is in
[04:48] <txfirehawk> njrib that is to connect to a pc, i want vncserver to accept incoming and it is but it will not accept the password
[04:48] <jrib> !lamp > bonggnu
[04:48] <txfirehawk> i have no idea how to change the pass
[04:48] <bonggnu> thanks
[04:48] <jrib> txfirehawk: remote desktop is to configure your computer so others can connect to it
[04:48] <jorgp> how do I get a UUID to add to fstab for another partition?
[04:48] <txfirehawk> let me take a 2nd look
[04:48] <php-freak_> kitche: Well duh.
[04:48] <txfirehawk> jas
[04:48] <canine_kouji> :D why can't hte ubuntu logo look like this? http://home.utcorp.net/~gongo/humor/IT/ubuntu-logo.jpg
[04:48] <php-freak_> Ktiche: how long you been using linux?
[04:49] <tomiboi> How do I update clamAV in Ubuntu?
[04:49] <canine_kouji> sexy female rear ends :D
[04:49] <kitche> php-freak_: about 5 years and I m using LFS right now
[04:49] <php-freak_> kitche: What do you think I was doing sending a directory? lol you can't send a a directory
[04:49] <php-freak_> I was trying to send the file from the directory into the proper directory on the host end.
[04:49] <jrib> !uuid | jorgp
[04:49] <ubotu> jorgp: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[04:49] <jerp> tom, there's an updater app in synaptic isn't there?
[04:50] <CzarAlex> When I hold either shift button or CTRL button and try to use my mouse to select multiple items in a list (in all applications), the mouse will freeze until i release the shift or CTRL key. So I can't select anything on the list. My system doesn't freeze, just the mouse. Suggestions?
[04:50] <jerp> I saw it a couple days ago
[04:50] <tomiboi> let me check.
[04:50] <jorgp> thanks jrib
[04:50] <britt> CzarAlex: check this, check to see if DOS emulation for USB is enabled
[04:50] <SupremeBeing> can anybody help me with fglrx?
[04:50] <britt> mine was and it messed everything up
[04:50] <CzarAlex> britt: where can I find that?
[04:50] <monokrome> Yo.
[04:50] <britt> CzarAlex: in the system BIOS.
[04:51] <HeathenDan> how do i make jpg photos "lighter" with gimp? they're too dark
[04:51] <britt> has it always done this?
=== First|Bleh is now known as FirstStrike
[04:51] <jorgp> well, if it is an Alan Cox thing, it has to be good
[04:51] <monokrome> Is it possible to copy the iptables from one computer to another
[04:51] <monokrome> :/
[04:51] <CzarAlex> britt: would that be the same as like enabling USB to work under DOS..like USB mouse/keyboard support for DOS/boot up stuff?
[04:51] <sigp239> My sound suddently starts stuttering in ubuntu 6.10.  Please help thanks.
[04:52] <CzarAlex> britt: Yeah it has but I think I turned that option on prior to installing once.
[04:52] <jerp> yeah, clam-getfiles
[04:52] <canine_kouji> *shrug* no wonder I'm never here. Too many noobs
[04:52] <sko0zy> Can anyone recommend an enviorment to code C in
[04:52] <TehUni> all the sudden my custom kernel (edgy) refuses to boot. it hangs right after USB discovery. using the generic kernel, everything is fine. It's worked flawlessly until now. I have to use custom because i have more than 4gigs ram. Where should i start troubleshooting?
[04:52] <jrib> sko0zy: vim, or anjuta if you want an IDE
[04:53] <w3ccv> sko0zy, you mean which editor?  vi, emacs, whatever you like!
[04:53] <CzarAlex> nano!
[04:53] <php-freak_> Never mind I figured out where the files were going
[04:53] <txfirehawk> man i dont know
[04:53] <sko0zy> jrib,  whwat would u suggest or what do you like better..i know its preference but i like imput
[04:53] <jorgp> jrib, interesting bug in that blkid
[04:53] <jerp> heather, look for layers/colors
[04:54] <php-freak_> kitche: sorry, but if you been using linux for 5 years your should know this, or maybe I was not being clearn enough if so I apologize
[04:54] <jrib> jorgp: oh?
[04:54] <britt> CzarAlex: yes its the same
[04:54] <jerp> brightness-contrast
[04:54] <astroboy> Last two attempts to install EdgyEft resulted in "Verifying DMI Pool Data ... Not found any [active partition]  in HDD ... DISK BOOT FALIURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER" Any ideas ? I've been working on this for two days now .
[04:54] <jrib> sko0zy: vim, definitely worth the time to learn it
[04:54] <talbain> heather gimp? picture window: tools->color tools->brightness contrast
[04:54] <sko0zy> jrib, thanks
[04:54] <jorgp> jrib, I just did a sudo blkid and it listed some then switched to garbage on screen
[04:54] <britt> CzarAlex: change that back, and you should be good to go. When mine was enabled, my mouse would stop working after a few seconds of connecting to the wireless thingy doo-hickey
[04:55] <CzarAlex> Using this page as a guide https://help.ubuntu.com/5.10/ubuntu/faq/C/fg-windows-partitions.html how would I mount hdb1 and sda1 ? both are NTFS filesystems. Do I need to change umask=0222 to anything different?
[04:55] <sigp239> My sound suddently starts stuttering in ubuntu 6.10.  Please help thanks.
[04:55] <CzarAlex> britt: gotcha. and thanks. Ill restart in a moment see if that fixes it.
[04:55] <jrib> jorgp: strange, you shouldn't need sudo by the way
[04:55] <kitche> php-freak_: you said / as the remove directory that will put it in your remote parent directory you can just try the filename alone when your in the remote directory
[04:55] <kitche> remove/remote
[04:55] <jorgp> jrib, http://pastebin.ca/265266
[04:56] <txfirehawk> i logged in and out and still no system > preferences.  not sure what to do now
[04:56] <jrib> txfirehawk: are you in GNOME?
[04:56] <txfirehawk> xfce
[04:56] <txfirehawk> is that what you mean?
[04:56] <jrib> txfirehawk: the system > preferences is in GNOME
[04:57] <kitche> php-freak_: just like ona  local machine cp <file name> /<filename> will put the file in /
[04:57] <txfirehawk> ok
[04:57] <jrib> txfirehawk: maybe you can run 'vino-preferences'.  I'm not sure if xfce uses this.  Search for 'vnc' on the wiki should turn up guides on using stuff other than vino though if you want
[04:58] <txfirehawk> what if i just install gnome?
[04:58] <sigp239> please help.  my sound stutters in ubuntu 6.10, how do i fix it?
[04:58] <jrib> txfirehawk: sure, that would work too.  Install the 'ubuntu-desktop' package
[04:58] <txfirehawk> ok give me a few
[04:59] <talbain> will linux ever be more popular than windows?
[04:59] <night17> maybe
[04:59] <night17> i doubt it
[04:59] <talbain> i hope so
[04:59] <jrib> !offtopic
[04:59] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[04:59] <night17> at least not for 10 years
[04:59] <CzarAlex> talbain: once more mainstream games are supported
[04:59] <kitche> php-freak_: I read what you said wrong but anyways I don't use the ftp cli program that much I prefer scp for uploading files to me webspace
[04:59] <talbain> true
[05:00] <night17> it needs to be distrobuted on commercial machines a lot
[05:00] <jorgp> jrib, I think maybe the label is messed up on a part, how do I change label?
[05:00] <night17> and people to get smarter
[05:00] <jerp> talbain, the French Parliment is envious of Gates and has dumped Windows in their government offices for Linux
[05:00] <talbain> i hope ubuntu is the start of the popularization
[05:00] <php-freak_> yea
[05:00] <britt> how efficient is software raid
[05:00] <talbain> cool
[05:00] <britt> seems like it would be a complete disaster in a real failure
[05:01] <jerp> http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6138372.html
[05:01] <sigp239> my sound stutters in ubuntu 6.10, how do i fix it?
[05:01] <britt> sigp239: check for updated gstreamer plugins
[05:01] <kitche> sigp239: what are you doing when your sound does it
[05:01] <night17> sigp239 just play round with it
[05:01] <britt> i used the 'ugly' build, and it worked fine.
[05:02] <sigp239> britt: but just regular sounds cause my system to stutter.  like desktop sounds.
[05:02] <jrib> jorgp: I don't know, but it's something I'd like to know so I'll let you know if google tells me
[05:02] <Davo_Dinkum> How can I use my CF to PCMCIA adapter in edgy? I plugged it in but it doesn't show upon the desktop.
[05:02] <jorgp> jrib, mtools does fat32 parts
[05:02] <sigp239> kitche: like logging in sounds, or playing mp3s, or the sounds produced when connecting on ekiga, etc..
[05:03] <knapp> Does anyone know of any lightweight office applications like an alternative to openoffice? It takes OO like 1minute to open on my laptop.
[05:03] <blameless> abiword, gnumeric ...
[05:03] <Davo_Dinkum> knapp: Abiword
[05:03] <jerp> I'd say check connections first, then reload packages
[05:03] <talbain> grat read, makes a lot of sense
[05:03] <knapp> Thanks, I'll check it out.
[05:04] <britt> sigp239: my ibook is doing that too, but its bc ubuntu is just choking it out
[05:04] <sigp239> britt: choking it out?
[05:04] <knapp> what about something like abiword, but for kde:?
[05:04] <knapp> :/
[05:04] <kitche> knapp: Koffice
[05:04] <Davo_Dinkum> Koffice might load quicker.
[05:05] <knapp> What word processor comes with Xubuntu?
[05:05] <jrib> jorgp: gparted seems to offer the option under device > set disklabel  but it prompted that it would need to erase all data
[05:05] <knapp> or office type prog
[05:05] <kitche> knapp: mousepad it's like notepad
[05:05] <sigp239> i'm really dissapointed in ubuntu
[05:05] <sigp239> stuff just doesn't work
[05:05] <knapp> Hmm, ok thanks
[05:05] <mirceatm> hi! i've got a problem booting ubuntu live 6.10 on amd64 with sata .. /bin/sh: Can't access tty; Job control turned off. read the forums but nothing is clear.. could someone help?
[05:05] <kitche> sigp239: what is your ram by chance?
[05:05] <Elda> Woooh
[05:05] <britt> sigp239: yeah too much for a g3 366 apparently, im gettins skipping on sound fx too
[05:05] <jorgp> jrib, im playing with mtools to see what it does
[05:05] <night17> sigp239- what are your pc specs?
[05:05] <Davo_Dinkum> I've heard of a system tray applet that preloads oo.o into memory, so when you go to use it, it's ready for you.
[05:05] <JoshJ> i'm having trouble opening a .rar file
[05:05] <Elda> I broke my install and managed to fix it xD
[05:05] <jorgp> jrib, http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/03/01/editing-fat32-partition-labels-using-mtools/
[05:05] <JoshJ> what do i need to get archive manager to work with rars?
[05:06] <sigp239> kitche: p4 3.06Ghz, 512mb memory
[05:06] <defrysk> JoshJ, in edgy sudo apt-get install unrar
[05:06] <TehUni> all the sudden my custom kernel (edgy) refuses to boot. it hangs right after USB discovery. using the generic kernel, everything is fine. It's worked flawlessly until now. I have to use custom because i have more than 4gigs ram. Where should i start troubleshooting?
[05:06] <sigp239> night17: p4 3.06Ghz, 512mb memory
[05:06] <kitche> sigp239: onboard sound?
[05:06] <Elda> Im glad that I saved the original settings with ## on the xorg.conf xD
[05:06] <JoshJ> and then the command is?
[05:06] <ozoneco> mirceatm: had that trouble, same thing, athlon 64, ubuntu live
[05:06] <JoshJ> oh, nvm, i see
[05:06] <jrib> jorgp: cool thanks
[05:06] <sigp239> kitche: i've tried my onboard sound and also my soundblaster live!
[05:06] <JoshJ> thanks
[05:06] <CzarAlex> Using this page as a guide https://help.ubuntu.com/5.10/ubuntu/faq/C/fg-windows-partitions.html how would I mount hdb1 and sda1 ? both are NTFS filesystems. Do I need to change umask=0222 to anything different?
[05:06] <ozoneco> mirceatm: loaded suse right up
[05:06] <sigp239> kitche: same problem with either sound card
[05:06] <kitche> TehUni: what does your custom kernel say?
[05:06] <defrysk> !unrar | JoshJ
[05:06] <ubotu> JoshJ: unrar is rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression  There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[05:07] <mirceatm> ozoneco: that's not an option :)
[05:07] <cheesybobman> hi
[05:07] <jorgp> jrib, blkid still has issues reading the label of a vfat part though
[05:07] <JoshJ> !info unrar-free
[05:07] <ubotu> unrar-free: Unarchiver for .rar files. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:0.0.1+cvs20060609-1 (edgy), package size 17 kB, installed size 80 kB
[05:07] <ozoneco> mirceatm: understand
[05:07] <TehUni> kitche: what do you mean "what does it say" ?
[05:07] <night17> if it works on my celeron 433mhz with 256mb ram it should be at home on yours sigp239
[05:07] <JoshJ> so if unrar-free is free as in speech, how do i have unrar (non-free) ?
[05:07] <kitche> sigp239: hmm sound skipping might be caused by esd not working
[05:07] <defrysk> JoshJ, dont use unrar-free
[05:07] <cheesybobman> i have ubuntu 6.06 LTS running on my Acer Aspire 5002WLMI and I can't get my wireless card to work. Help please?
[05:07] <sigp239> kitche: should I disable esd and reboot?
[05:07] <kitche> TehUni: does it kernel panic? since if it does it usualy has an error along side it
[05:07] <JoshJ> yeah, i noticed, it didn't work :[
[05:08] <mirceatm> ozoneco: so.. now you have suse and stay around in #ubuntu? :)
[05:08] <kitche> sigp239: you can try that just to see if it rules it out
[05:08] <defrysk> JoshJ,  unrar-free does not support multiple archived rars
[05:08] <ozoneco> this pc has ubuntu
[05:08] <TehUni> kitche: nope.. just hangs after detecting usb devices.
[05:08] <cheesybobman> anyone?
[05:09] <jrib> !wireless | cheesybobman
[05:09] <ubotu> cheesybobman: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:09] <kitche> TehUni: did you update recently?
[05:09] <mirceatm> hi! i've got a problem booting ubuntu live 6.10 on amd64 with sata .. /bin/sh: Can't access tty; Job control turned off. read the forums but nothing is clear.. could someone help?
[05:09] <levander> Trying to mount a cd, I just got the error: "unknown filesystem type 'iso9660'".  Do I have to install the iso9660 fs separate?
[05:09] <php-freak_> Kitche: Dang is Linux case sensitive on everything?
[05:09] <jrib> mirceatm: all I can suggest is trying the alternate install cd assuming you are trying to install
[05:09] <JoshJ> php-freak_ : yes
[05:09] <TehUni> kitche: yea, i do an apt-get upgrade almost daily. but haven't seen anything major lately
[05:09] <mirceatm> jrib: will try that.
[05:10] <kitche> TehUni: maybe it broke your kernel
[05:10] <php-freak_> joshj: do you use gimp?
[05:10] <Elda> meh, brb
[05:10] <Elda> somethign is acting odd
[05:10] <TehUni> kitche: i recompiled the exact same kernel, with the exact same result.
[05:10] <JoshJ> php-freak_: no, i use krita when i need to do graphics editing
[05:10] <php-freak_> Any one a gimp expert here.
[05:11] <php-freak_> I need something that could produce possibly the same effects as photoshop?
[05:11] <w3ccv> php-freak_, not an expert, but a user what's up
[05:11] <kitche> php-freak_:  might want to ask #gimp over at gnome's irc server
[05:11] <tristanbob_> anyone recommend a vendor to buy an Ubuntu server from?
[05:11] <php-freak_> Well how can I download all the plug ins for gimp?
[05:11] <w3ccv> php-freak_,  what effect?
[05:11] <php-freak_> lol all of them
[05:11] <JoshJ> ...
[05:11] <zach634> tristanbob: anybody? ubuntu is free
[05:11] <night17> tristanbob-just download and burnit
[05:12] <night17> it's cheaper
[05:12] <JoshJ> so you want to know "how do i use gimp?"
[05:12] <jrib> I think tristanbob_ means a physical server
[05:12] <w3ccv> php-freak_, easy, use the onlinetutorials or the GIMP book
[05:12] <night17> whichever one is closest

[05:12] <zach634> jrib: yes, anything will work.  Hell, like, find some old computer lying on the side of the road or something :P
[05:13] <night17> oh ok
[05:13] <night17> i c what you mean
[05:13] <jrib> tristanbob_: ob-just download and burnit
[05:13] <tristanbob_> zach634: this is for a small business, looking to support those who support UBuntu
[05:13] <zach634> tristanbob: newegg.com  build your own for cheap
[05:13] <jrib> tristanbob_: http://system76.com/  seem like nice people,, no experience though
[05:13] <whalesalad> hey everyone, im trying to change my mysql root password and each time I attempt to change the password, I get some errors.
[05:14] <tristanbob_> jrib: yes, I have heard of them - looking at website
[05:14] <php-freak> sorry lost connection
[05:14] <tristanbob_> zach634: I used to do that (still get upgrades from newegg) but I prefer to purchase tested configurations now
[05:14] <sigp239> i've tried two different sound cards, and now I've tried disabling ESD.  The  sound is still stuttering very badly.
[05:14] <w3ccv> whalesalad, as mysql root, remember to use the password() function
[05:14] <whalesalad> tristianbob: unless its a mac, the best way to go is newegg
[05:15] <whalesalad> w3ccv: im trying to do this from the command line, i just got the box setup with edgy server, and now im getting django runnin too. mysql seems to be having problems..
[05:15] <tristanbob_> whalesalad: what command are you using?
[05:15] <blameless> define a "tested" configuration
[05:15] <whalesalad> im following thsi guide for the mysql portion, http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p4
[05:16] <w3ccv> whalesalad, probably easier ways but  update user set password=password{"newpassword") where user=root;
[05:16] <whalesalad> mysqladmin -u root password yourrootsqlpassword    <- is the command that gives me errors
[05:16] <tristanbob_> blameless: just that - the hardware components have been tested to work with each other
[05:16] <tristanbob_> whalesalad: try using "sudo"?
[05:16] <blameless> there are several places online where you can configure a barebones machines and the company will actually put the machine together and see that it works
[05:16] <whalesalad> im already root right now
[05:16] <tristanbob_> ahh
[05:16] <whalesalad> root@wsdev:/home/whalesalad# mysqladmin -u root password *******
[05:16] <whalesalad> mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
[05:16] <whalesalad> error: 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'
[05:17] <w3ccv> whalesalad, I think you need password= in your commandline
[05:17] <snid> i need some help using with high mem (ram) support....do i need to enable high memory support for the ubuntu kernel?
[05:17] <whalesalad> w3ccv: three different places, including mysql itself has said to do that command, so thats what ive been toying with.
[05:18] <blameless> whalesalad: what happens if you add a -p <oldpassword) after the -u root
[05:18] <tristanbob_> whalesalad: I think that command is just for the initial password
[05:18] <whalesalad> i think it might be a hostname issue
[05:18] <whalesalad> blameless, let me try that
[05:18] <defrysk> snid, the generic supports high mem
[05:18] <tristanbob_> blameless: yes, that is what he needs for changing a password
[05:19] <snid> defrysk: hmmm... when i run vmware and with the setting to use most of the ram... alot of my ram gets swapped... and im not sure why
[05:19] <whalesalad> blameless, well it apparently works... hehe
[05:19] <w3ccv> whalesalad, either use -p and it will ask for a password or use password=<yourcurrentpassword>
[05:19] <defrysk> snid, nu clue about vmware, sorry
[05:19] <snid> defrysk: is there a kernel parameter i can pass to enable memory to be less likely to be swapped or something?
=== cew_musik is now known as ce_nduyh
=== ce_nduyh is now known as ce_nduth
[05:20] <blameless> snid: yes the swappiness variable.  however, if vmware is taking up as much memory as it can, things will probably be swapped out
[05:20] <whalesalad> i guess what the problem is, is that im trying to connect to the databse server from my macbook using an app called navacat, when i try and connect it tells me that the host (my macbook) is not allowed to connect to the mysql server

[05:20] <defrysk> stepanstas, now that is a detailed question
[05:21] <stepanstas> ok, well...
[05:21] <cafuego_> whalesalad: Just add access; grant all on db.* to user@remotehostname identified by 'password';
[05:21] <stepanstas> when im on ubuntu.com, forums, and everything, its fine
[05:21] <cafuego_> whalesalad: and then 'flush privileges;'
[05:21] <stepanstas> but when i go to gmail, digg, google vid, and everything else
[05:21] <whalesalad> cafuego_: sorry. im an sql noob, how do I do that?
[05:21] <stepanstas> it closes
[05:22] <blameless> what error does it give?
[05:22] <snid> blameless: thanks.. that seems to be what i needed
[05:22] <cafuego_> whalesalad: 'sudo mysql', then run those commands
[05:22] <w3ccv> whalesalad, read the error message - when it says password-NO it means a password wasn't asked for and it needed one.
[05:22] <cafuego_> whalesalad: actually, just 'mysql -u root' and not sudo at all
[05:22] <blameless> snid: the ck patchset also uses a mapped watermark way of taking care of swap.  might want to look into that as well
[05:22] <stepanstas> anybody know why im having these problems with firefox?
[05:22] <defrysk> stepanstas, you installed flash and java with .debs from the repositories ?
[05:22] <whalesalad> ok well its giving me that password error, so how do I login with the password in the terminal
[05:23] <whalesalad> -p and the password doesnt work
[05:23] <w3ccv> whalesalad, mysql -l root -p
[05:23] <whalesalad> ok nevermind, i figured it out
[05:23] <stepanstas> defrysk: i resently installed adobe flash though the site
[05:23] <cafuego_> whalesalad: did you set a root password for mysql?
[05:23] <blameless> stepanstas: start firefox from the terminal, go to a website and let it crash.  it should tell you an error message
[05:23] <whalesalad> haha sorry, its been a while and i keep not trying what i already know thinking it wot work
[05:23] <w3ccv> whalesalad, congrats
[05:23] <whalesalad> yeah, so now im on the command line. how can I grant access to my macbook, so i guess systems other than localhost
[05:23] <defrysk> stepanstas, and removed the old one (flash7) ?
[05:24] <stepanstas> blameless, my first day using linux
[05:24] <stepanstas> how do i get o terminal

[05:25] <stepanstas> it closed
[05:25] <cafuego_> don't believe fierljeppen
[05:25] <whalesalad> cafuego: how can I tell mysql that anyoen from the ip ______ is allowed
[05:25] <stepanstas> i see no error
[05:25] <cafuego_> whalesalad: %@remotehost
[05:25] <defrysk> cafuego, I do :p
[05:26] <stepanstas> blameless, what do i do?
[05:26] <blameless> stepanstas: what about opening firefox and going to about:plugins.  what plugins are enabled?

[05:26] <defrysk> stepanstas, where are you talking about ?
[05:26] <stepanstas> i didnt get an error
[05:26] <snid> blameless: hmm... there isnt an ubuntu kernel built with ck patches is there?... i really hate compiling my own kernel.. i like everything to just upgrade and work by itself
[05:26] <whalesalad> cafuego: that doesnt seem to do anything in the mysql shell
[05:26] <defrysk> stepanstas, listen to blameless , I'm gonna make some coffee
[05:26] <stepanstas> k defrysk
[05:26] <snid> blameless: dont be confused... i was once a gentoo user, then got sick of waiting on compiles and broken dependencies
[05:26] <blameless> snid: no, i don't believe so.  i generally compile my own kernel on all of my machines.  other than this one which for some reason has issues with gdm on my own compiled

[05:28] <kitche> snid: no there is no kernel with ck patches since ck patches are meant more for power users
[05:28] <bunnythebunny> hello
[05:28] <stepanstas> blameless, i tried again, got an error. The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
[05:28] <stepanstas> This probably reflects a bug in the program.
[05:28] <stepanstas> The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
[05:28] <stepanstas>   (Details: serial 118 error_code 8 request_code 144 minor_code 3)
[05:28] <stepanstas>   (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
[05:28] <stepanstas>    that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
[05:28] <stepanstas>    To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
[05:29] <stepanstas>    option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
[05:29] <stepanstas>    backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

[05:29] <blameless>  /ignore ubotu all
[05:29] <defrysk> a java archive why would you do that ?
[05:30] <blameless> to get the cookies out?
[05:30] <stepanstas> sorry, didnt know
[05:30] <whis1> HAH
[05:30] <defrysk> bunnythebunny, thry java -jar blah.jar
[05:31] <blameless> stepanstas: i'm not sure what caused that error.  is firefox the only thing giving you fits?
[05:31] <bunnythebunny> defrysk, thanks
[05:31] <stepanstas> so far
[05:31] <stepanstas> it is the only program that closed
[05:31] <whis1> can anyone help me figure out why fglrx 8.24.8 fails compiling?
[05:31] <defrysk> bunnythebunny, not sure if i was correct had to dig deep in my mem
[05:31] <kitche> whis`: you have the kernel source installed?
[05:31] <blameless> stepanstas: try opening it up, and typing about:plugins in the location bar.  what plugins are in there?
[05:32] <whis1> kitche: unless it came with dapper then i doubt it, how do i go about getting it?
[05:32] <php-freak> How Do I know where my packages went? I just opened up a .bin file, and it opened up in the terminal, but what do i do now?
[05:32] <bunnythebunny> defrysk, it didnt work! Exception in thread "main" java.awt.AWTError: Cannot load AWT toolkit: gnu.java.awt.peer.gtk.GtkToolkit
[05:32] <kitche> bunnythebunny: it's jar -x blah.jar java -jar blah.jar actually runs the .jar file
[05:32] <defrysk> kitche, thanks :)
[05:32] <kitche> whis1: it's in synaptic linux-tree or linux-source
[05:32] <chris_> Can anyone give me a hand with some wireless networking trouble?  It recognizes my wireless card, can see the essid being broadcast, but cannot connect to it.
[05:32] <blameless> php-freak: which bin file?
[05:32] <php-freak> blameless: what do you mean?
[05:33] <bunnythebunny> thanks kitche
[05:33] <php-freak> blameless: ZendStudio-5_1_0.bin
[05:33] <blameless> usually .bin files are created by makeself to install a program.  i was just curious which one it was.  anyway, open up a termina and run the .bin file inside the terminal
[05:33] <blameless> it should as you where you want to put it
[05:34] <m0dY> anyone with shell scripting experience here ?
[05:34] <stepanstas> blameless,http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35150/
[05:34] <xiechy> I have upgrade to feisty
[05:34] <blameless> chris_: what type of card, 802.11b/g, etc?
[05:34] <xiechy> but the IO performance is extremely slow
[05:34] <blameless> stepanstas: so you just have flash 7 and totem in there?
[05:35] <php-freak> ZendStudio-5_1_0.bin so just type that in the terminal in the same directory as the file?
[05:35] <kitche> xiechy: of course it will be slow it's not even stable yet it's the development version of ubuntu
[05:35] <blameless> stepanstas: how did flash 7 get installed?
[05:35] <sujan> hi, i am unable to wma file with totem
[05:35] <stepanstas> blameless, there is also the quicktime plugin
[05:35] <blameless> stepanstas: my guess, and its a guess, is that that would be the problem.  flash is really the only plugin that gmail is going to use
[05:35] <kitche> php-freak: it will be sh ZendStudio-5_1_0.bin or you can chmod +x the file then put ./ infront of the filename
[05:36] <RancidLM> hey all kinda off topic question i would like to play a video game system from a window on the screen i have a hauppauge capture card but unbuntu doesn't detect it.. first off would this work or would there be a massive delay?
[05:36] <sujan> are there any extra plugin that is required for that
[05:36] <stepanstas> blameless, i was on metacafe.com
[05:36] <php-freak> nows whats SH stand for?
[05:36] <stepanstas> it told me i needed it
[05:36] <xiechy> /exit
[05:36] <php-freak> okay says unpacking the jre file
[05:36] <blameless> stepanstas: so you clicked and installed it from inside of firefox?
[05:36] <matthew_> php-freak, it stands for SHell
[05:36] <kitche> php-freak: it's a shell but is used to run executables if you use bash or sh
[05:37] <stepanstas> i did both as a matter of fact
[05:37] <php-freak> grep: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[05:37] <php-freak> /tmp/install.dir.19440/Linux/resource/jre/bin/java: error while loading shared libraries: libpthread.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[05:37] <stepanstas> i believe first was the one outside
[05:37] <php-freak> I got that message right after it said launcing installer
[05:37] <blameless> stepanstas: do you have any bookmarks or stuff you need to save for firefox?
[05:37] <stepanstas> should i get rid of it?
[05:37] <blameless> stepanstas: i would try getting rid of it and see what that does
[05:38] <stepanstas> no, i didnt save anythign yet
[05:38] <kitche> php-freak: that libc.so.6 error isn't really good
[05:38] <blameless> stepanstas: open up a terminal and try a rm -rf ~/.mozilla  that will restore firefox to its inital configuration
[05:38] <blameless> stepanstas: it will also remove the flash 7 plugin
[05:38] <IdleOne> what package do I need to install to view files on my windows machine?
[05:38] <php-freak> kitche: what do you mean it not really good lol?
[05:38] <whalesalad> hey ive got another question. i have a macbook running osx and would like to connect to the server, which is not on the same subnet, using something more sophisticated than ftp so that I can browse and manage files almost like they were local. anyone know how I might do this?
[05:39] <kitche> php-freak: libc.so.6 is a lib that actually used by the linux base system
[05:39] <whis1> kitche: after getting linux-source (with ubuntu patches of course) fglrx was still not able to compile... i'm checking out logs now
[05:39] <kitche> php-freak: see what ls says
[05:39] <m0dY> how to make a shell script run in the background without being able to be killed even on ctrl+c ?
[05:40] <kitche> m0dy: ./<script> bg
[05:40] <blameless> whalesalad: i tend to just sync my directories back and forth
[05:40] <m0dY> kitche, i want it to be inserted in the script
[05:40] <whis1> i believe it goes wrong with /lib/modules/fglrx/build_mod/firegl_agpgart/firegl_wrap.c:1362: error: struct <anonymous> has no member named pud
[05:40] <whalesalad> blameless: ive considered that and it wont work, i guess ill just need to move the server onto the same subnet and use samba or something
[05:40] <m0dY> so you don't have to do it in execution
[05:41] <blameless> whalesalad: is this macos to a windows box?
[05:41] <php-freak> ktiche: wahts ls stand for
[05:41] <defrysk> list
[05:41] <php-freak> I can't remember that ones looks famaliar though
[05:41] <whis1> man ls
[05:41] <kitche> m0dY: php-freak: it means list directory contents sorta like dir in windows
[05:41] <php-freak> same as dir
[05:41] <whis1> php-freak: yes
[05:42] <m0dY> kitche ?!
[05:42] <kitche>  m0dY don't midn what I just said I had your name typed and din't realize it
[05:42] <php-freak> okay it says ZendStudio-5_1_0.bin
[05:42] <m0dY> kitche, np
[05:42] <sigp239> forget this....i'm going to wal-mart to buy windows....at least it works
[05:43] <doom> How can we submit packages to the repositories?
[05:43] <blameless> whalesalad: there is of course, openafs
[05:43] <matthew_> sigp239, you'll come back, they always do
[05:43] <zach634> lol @ sigp239
[05:43] <kitche> doom: look up contrib on the wiki it should tell you there someplace
[05:43] <doom> ok
[05:43] <defrysk> matthew_, no hes too smart for that :D
[05:43] <matthew_> defrysk, riiiiiiiigggggggghhhhhttttt
[05:43] <zach634> "<sigp239> $249.99? yeah right!"
[05:43] <matthew_> lol
[05:43] <php-freak> kitche: it says ZendStudio-5_1_0.bin
[05:44] <kitche> php-freak: hmm ok that works it odd that you got the libc.so.6 error maybe it has to deal with the libpthread.so perhaps
[05:44] <whis1> hmmm i still need help with errors on compiling agpart module if anyone can help
[05:44] <stepanstas> blameless: firefox doesnt want to launch now
[05:45] <php-freak> why is this a big deal?
[05:45] <blameless> stepanstas: what happens when you run it in a terminal?
[05:45] <whalesalad> blameless: this is os x to an ubuntu box (hence me being in the ubuntu room =]  )
[05:45] <stepanstas> Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server - Xlib: No protocol specified - (firefox-bin:5517): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:
[05:45] <blameless> whalesalad: just checking :).  well you could set up openafs on the ubuntu box (as the server) and connect to it with an afs client on the os x box.  afs was always too complicated for me to setup though
[05:46] <LinuxHelp> Does the "sync" mount option for ext3 disable just write-behind or read-ahead as well?
[05:46] <stepanstas> i seperated enters by -
[05:46] <kitche> php-freak: see if you have libc installed
[05:46] <php-freak> lol how do I do that
[05:46] <JoshJ> sudo apt-get install build-essential
[05:46] <whalesalad> blameless: if its too complicated to setup its not gonna work :) i gotta do something totally seamless
[05:46] <JoshJ> imo
[05:46] <blameless> stepanstas: are you logged into that terminal as a different user than the one running X
[05:47] <stepanstas> not sure what you mean, i am the only user on this compu
[05:47] <kitche> php-freak: well you can look in your cache or use synatpic or aptitude to see if you have it installed

[05:49] <php-freak> kitche: i see, but what do I do?
[05:50] <JoshJ> in the future do ps -e to see a list of all the process
[05:50] <JoshJ> then kill it by number, much better that way
[05:50] <kitche> php-freak: in aptitude it should have a section that says installed programs and see if libc is installed
[05:50] <JoshJ> isn't libc a part of build-essential?
[05:51] <kitche> JoshJ: it should be part of the linux even not part of build-essential
[05:51] <JoshJ> heh
[05:51] <JoshJ> you mean GNU coreutils?
[05:51] <kitche> JoshJ: no it's it's own package

[06:16] <Mixx`> are there instructions out there for how to (easily) upgrade to the 2.19 kernel?  I've looked and nothing seems tailored to ubuntu
[06:17] <mrclark> nolimitsoya, so using amd64 installers on an intel core 2 system is kosher?

[06:46] <whalesalad> ok heres my question, restated in a different way. I have no gui, no gnome, no kde. I have a server install of Edgy Eft. Right now it is configued for a static ip, I need to configure it to work with DHCP and automatically recieve an ip from my router. is tehre a place I can go to figure out how to do this, or is there someone here to help me
[06:47] <binarydigit> cnc: try modprobe uhci_hcd and echi_hcd
[06:48] <nolimitsoya> whalesalad, perhaps this will help you? :) -> http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/s1-dhcp-configuring-client.html
[06:48] <spx2> whalesalad do you have a dhcp server running on your server ?
[06:48] <CzarAlex> nolimitsoya: vlc worked! thanks.
[06:48] <whalesalad> spx2: no, i need the server configured as a dhcp client
[06:48] <orestyle5_> cnc:  this is long shot, but I wonder if the drivers are loading too soon.  I had issues with system loading drivers in debian, I had to compile kernel with specific drivers
[06:48] <nolimitsoya> CzarAlex, np :)
[06:48] <spx2> whalesalad are you sure that's what you want ?
[06:49] <whalesalad> yes, im certain
[06:49] <whalesalad> its a dev box
[06:49] <cnc> FATAL: Module echi_hcd not found.
[06:49] <spx2> whalesalad what's a dev box supposed to mean ?
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> spx2, i think ha want a dhcp _client_, for his server machine :)
[06:49] <cnc> the other returns nothing

[06:49] <firefly2442> spx2: development?
[06:49] <whalesalad> its a developer box, im a web developer, this isnt going to be a production machine, its on my internal network, so I need DHCP
[06:49] <cnc> how can i recompile the drivers?
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> whalesalad, did you check out the link?
[06:50] <whalesalad> yea
[06:50] <spx2> whalesalad yes ,but "web developing" is not quite developing,it's more near to "loosing time for money"
[06:50] <binarydigit> cnc: sorry ehci_hcd
[06:50] <nolimitsoya> whalesalad, was i helpfull?
[06:50] <whalesalad> spx2: what exactly are you getting at? if you can help me help me, if not shut up, i dont need your snide comments.

[07:13] <firefly2442> blake_: hmm, well as long as you installed Ubuntu after you removed Vista I would think it should work
[07:14] <PFA> DBO: GNAA -_-'
[07:14] <nolimitsoya> defrysk, id go for a netsplit :)
[07:14] <wastrel> scriptkiddie

[07:15] <fgeller> did someone get to see my messages?
[07:15] <defrysk> fgeller, nope
[07:16] <fgeller> -_-
[07:16] <fgeller> i'm trying to install the multimedia support by using automatix2, but for example the extra fonts fail to install raising an error message that msttcorefonts has no installation candidate, and similarily for mplayer
[07:16] <fgeller> does anyone know what that would be? i also tried to do it manually following the tutorial at http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy#How_to_add_extra_repositories but i still get the  same error messages
[07:16] <defrysk> !automatix | fgeller
[07:16] <ubotu> fgeller: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:16] <nolimitsoya> !automatix | fgeller
[07:16] <Red_Death> lol
[07:16] <fgeller> okok
[07:16] <fgeller> :P
[07:16] <Red_Death> rains have given way to floods
[07:16] <fgeller> than disregard the automatix thing
[07:17] <DBO> elkbuntu, op up the fun isnt over...
[07:17] <fgeller> same thing happens if i follow the quoted guide though
[07:17] <defrysk> fgeller, read this discussion on automatix : http://blogs.ubuntu-nl.org/dennis/2006/10/29/how-healthy-is-your-ubuntu-system/

[07:17] <fgeller> mpf
[07:18] <fgeller> guess this is not the time to ask questions mh
[07:19] <joejaxx> what type of question?
[07:19] <defrysk> fgeller, read this discussion on automatix : http://blogs.ubuntu-nl.org/dennis/2006/10/29/how-healthy-is-your-ubuntu-system/
[07:20] <defrysk> anyone else too for that matter
[07:20] <fgeller> defrysk: i only tried automatix after the ubuntuguide didn't work
[07:20] <fgeller> defrysk: i don't really need/want to use it either
[07:20] <defrysk> fgeller, ubuntuguide is also not an ideal resource
[07:20] <fgeller> defrysk: but apt-get seems to not find some packages
[07:20] <firebird619> My monitors native resolution is 1680x1050, however, in system, preferences, screen resolution, the highest resolution listed is 1280x1024. 1680x1050 is listed in xorg.conf. How can I get it to use the native resolution.
[07:21] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, you need to enable repositories
[07:21] <fgeller> defrysk: well where should i go then to install simple multimedia support and msttcorefonts
[07:21] <binarydigit> firebird619: paste your xorg.conf to pastebin
[07:21] <cmweb> finaly some new ops
[07:21] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: i do have like 12 entries in sources.list -- is there a way to find out what repository supposedly has the packages i'm looking for
[07:22] <defrysk> !mp3 | fgeller
[07:22] <ubotu> fgeller: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[07:22] <defrysk> !msttcorefonts | fgeller
[07:22] <ubotu> msttcorefonts: Installer for Microsoft TrueType core fonts. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 22 kB, installed size 164 kB
[07:22] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, add universe and multiverse to those lines
[07:22] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: they are there
[07:22] <defrysk> fgeller, and listen to nolimitsoya
[07:23] <fgeller> let me paste the sources.list into a pastebin?
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, then do sudo apt-get update
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, btw, are you running edgy or dapper?
[07:24] <firebird619> binarydigit: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35154/
[07:24] <defrysk> fgeller, you already have automatix installed ?
[07:24] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: edgy
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, good. then everything you need is in the repos :)
[07:25] <fgeller> defrysk: yes
[07:25] <defrysk> fgeller, ouch
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, then youre in troublle :P
[07:25] <madewokherd> can someone VERSION-flood the channel again? I want to know if I fixed my client properly
[07:25] <defrysk> fgeller, you might be in trouble then :(
[07:25] <fgeller> defrysk: hehe you guys make it sound like a crime
[07:25] <Zehrila> Hello everyone!
[07:25] <defrysk> fgeller, not a crime just a major problem
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, as said by ubuntu, i can break thing. badly sp,
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> *so
[07:26] <Zehrila> Well, I've managed setting up ubuntu after a few dozen tries and retries, and am now having problems going online from it.
[07:26] <defrysk> fgeller, /j #automatix for help or maybe a reinstall after backing up might be a plan
[07:26] <Zehrila> I can't seem to connect using my dialup modem, from the list where all network connection methods are given where we have to check/uncheck the entries to connect/disconnect.
[07:26] <fgeller> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35155/
[07:27] <Zehrila> Is there any alternative method like a conventional dial-up program?
[07:27] <Zehrila> My modem seems to be detected since it shows up in that list.
[07:27] <fgeller> pretty sure i got all the repos in there that i would need for something like msttcorefonts, or am i missing some
[07:27] <Zehrila> Now why would anyone be lame enough to flood THIS channel?
[07:27] <xanavim> what's going on in #ubuntu?
[07:27] <fgeller> should i remove automatix then
[07:28] <nolimitsoya> ok, did anyone ask me something before i dropped out?
[07:28] <vader1102> DBO sorry bout that lol
[07:28] <Zehrila> No clue.
[07:29] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: probably me asking whether i should remove automatix because i didn't get to read your replies
[07:29] <fgeller> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35155/
[07:29] <JoshJ> !op
[07:29] <defrysk> fgeller, it cannot be removed!! thats the joy of automatix
[07:29] <ubotu> Help! Keybuk, mdz, Amaranth, tritium, ajmitch, crimsun, ogra, CarlK, Seveas, Burgundavia, apokryphos, thoreauputic, nalioth, Madpilot, ompaul, rob, Hobbsee, imbrandon, DBO, LjL, elkbuntu, Mez or gnomefreak!
[07:29] <Zehrila> Though I have something to ask you now. =] 
[07:29] <JoshJ> or nvm, elkbuntu is here already
[07:29] <xanavim> this is weird.  /quit wouldn't work... is someone hacking this server?
[07:29] <defrysk> fgeller, its not a package, its a script
[07:29] <JoshJ> idiots :(
[07:29] <JoshJ> i don't get why someone would do that to this channel
[07:29] <defrysk> fgeller, messing up your ubuntu
[07:29] <JoshJ> ...bleh
[07:29] <JoshJ> why would ubotu slow down?
[07:29] <xanavim> JoshJ: someone is DOS's ubotu
[07:29] <vader1102> anyone have a good vi ebook or something on VI?
[07:29] <JoshJ> ah, hrm
[07:29] <xanavim> er, DOS'ing
[07:29] <JoshJ> valid, i guess
[07:29] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, once you let it taint your system, you are royaly screwed :)
[07:29] <JoshJ> easyubuntu is a bit less rough on your system than automatix
[07:30] <Zehrila> I can't seem to connect using my dialup modem, from the list (forgot the name; I got to it from the menu somewhere) where all network connection methods are given where we have to check/uncheck the entries to connect/disconnect.
[07:30] <xanavim> vader1102: yes, grab vim and read the manual built-in to it
[07:30] <JoshJ> that said you're better off using add/remove programs
[07:30] <defrysk> automatix is the ultimate ubuntu virus
[07:30] <Zehrila> Is there any alternative method like a conventional dial-up program?
[07:30] <fgeller> defrysk: well for all i know, i simply have to remove the couple of lines from sources.list and not start automatix and everything is quiet
[07:30] <nolimitsoya> Zehrila, is it a winmodem?
[07:30] <vader1102> xanavim, thanx
[07:30] <Zehrila> nolimitsoya: It's a hardware modem, as far as I know, though I might be wrong.
[07:30] <defrysk> fgeller, you wish
[07:30] <theshibboleth> I remember that it's possible to run Ubuntu from a CD with a USB drive to store data from one session to the next, but I forget how to do this. Anyone have the information?
[07:30] <Zehrila> nolimitsoya: It's a COMPAQ notebook.
[07:31] <JoshJ> theshibboleth : you mean saving configs etc, or just saving files?
[07:31] <fgeller> well could we forget about the automatix thing for a second and figure out what repository i'm missing if any?
[07:31] <nolimitsoya> theshibboleth, casper-rw :)
[07:31] <zero-1> hi
[07:31] <fgeller> please >_<
[07:31] <snid> i have this weird problem... im not sure if its fluxbox, or xorg.. i have these keys configured to switch workspace, and sometimes, randomly, after pressing one of these keys, fluxbox will go into a loop of quickly changing workspace as if i am holding down the key to change, although i cannot stop it from rapidly changing workspace and have to wait ~5 or 10 minutes until it finally stops... and then my ALT key is held down and when i open up a
[07:31] <snid>  virtual on screen keyboard i can see that the ALT key is in a pressed down state and i cant reverse this without restarting xorg. any suggestions on where to start?
[07:31] <zero-1> Im having a problem when I bot up my ubuntu box every once in a while i get a kernel panic
[07:31] <defrysk> fgeller, you are missing now the way ubuntu should be set up
[07:32] <theshibboleth> nolimitsoya,, thanks.
[07:32] <nolimitsoya> theshibboleth, np :)
[07:32] <defrysk> fgeller, and there is now way of reverting it back
[07:32] <fgeller> defrysk: that is a very precise statement htat let's me understand the problem
[07:32] <defrysk> nowc = no
[07:32] <nolimitsoya> theshibboleth, just give that label to a memorystick, and youre in the gravy :)
[07:32] <C|436237> or maybe your alt key is stuck
[07:32] <zero-1> what can I do to stop getting that kernel panic
[07:32] <Zehrila> nolimitsoya: The modem seems to be connected since I hear the tone when I use it with that bundled soft-phone application.
[07:32] <fgeller> defrysk: i already told you that it wasn't finding the packages before i used automatix
[07:32] <Zehrila> detected*
[07:33] <defrysk> fgeller, automatix does not only install, it also changes
[07:33] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, as i said, youll have to do a apt-get update after adding repos
[07:33] <defrysk> the changes create the probs
[07:33] <defrysk> for noone knows what those changes are
[07:34] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: which repo is it that i'm missing though, and yes i always do a apt-get update after modifying the sources.list
[07:34] <nolimitsoya> !pastebin > nolimitsoya
[07:34] <defrysk> fgeller, I would simply reinstall , start over and have a clean untainted system, safe to use
[07:35] <fgeller> defrysk: haha you a windows user or what
[07:35] <Zehrila> Heh.
[07:35] <JoshJ> haha
[07:35] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35155/
[07:35] <defrysk> fgeller, havent used windows in 6 years
[07:35] <JoshJ> "reinstall the OS" is definitely a windows mentality
[07:35] <fgeller> defrysk: well that solution awfully sounds like ms solutions
[07:35] <JoshJ> but it's valid occasionally on linux :P
[07:35] <Zehrila> I must admit, Windows is the easiset to get up and running out of the box.
[07:35] <JoshJ> Zehrila : not true actually
[07:35] <defrysk> JoshJ, installing automatix is a windows mentality
[07:35] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35156/ <- thatd be my sources.list
[07:35] <JoshJ> it's only easy when using a OEM cd
[07:35] <Elda> Well using windows for most of my life I would have to say I sadly have that mentality still :s
[07:36] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, thatd give you everything you want
[07:36] <JoshJ> an off-the-shelf windows will likely have issues
[07:36] <JoshJ> whether it be with a printer or what
[07:36] <defrysk> fgeller,  installing automatix is a windows mentality
[07:36] <Zehrila> Well, as far as my experiences go, JoshJ. Last night, I had to try installing ubuntu atleast a couple of dozen times.
[07:36] <JoshJ> Elda leave stuff alone lol :P
[07:36] <Hirvinen> Zehrila: Quite a strange claim.
[07:36] <Elda> Only way you learn is by experimenting :s
[07:36] <JoshJ> uh
[07:36] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: kk, will try that, thanks!
[07:36] <vader1102> Zehrila, not for me, I have had 0 problems with ubuntu wuth 1 exception, my wifes ibm desktop, 6.06 don't like the video (onboard)
[07:36] <JoshJ> 24 times?
[07:36] <Elda> At least I know what not to do now xD
[07:36] <Zehrila> Atleast 24 times.
[07:37] <Rookie_> Elda - i have used nix for 7 years and i still install and reinstall a dist several times before im happy with it ;)
[07:37] <Zehrila> And then succeeded only by doing a CLI-only installation, heh.
[07:37] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, just make sure not the paste in those numbers that pastebin adds to every line :)
[07:37] <Elda> Last time I broke it I tried to update the graphics driver thing, lol and even though I actually managed to fix it on my own some other drivers broke :s
[07:37] <vader1102> I will have to try Edgy on it I guess
[07:37] <Elda> Though I discovered nano xD
[07:37] <Zehrila> Then doing apt-get install ubuntu-desktop took another dozen or so tries.
[07:37] <swanand> hi there//
[07:37] <orestyle5> you want to really see windows with problems, wait til the next version comes out
[07:37] <JoshJ> nano :D
[07:37] <swanand> need help...
[07:37] <Rookie_> !ask
[07:37] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:37] <nikin> Elda: that was worth it :D
[07:37] <nolimitsoya> Elda, you shouldnt have to update graphics drivers. just install them from the repo
[07:37] <JoshJ> i like vi(m) i'm just too lazy to learn it
[07:38] <Elda> ooh
[07:38] <Elda> I should check the rebo thingy
[07:38] <Elda> Thats through the package manager correct?
[07:38] <vader1102> JoshJ, hehehe I have to I run a server with no gui lol
[07:38] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: hehe yeah, was happy to find the "make correction" - box
[07:38] <malt> is there anyway, when i give a few peopel hosting to my linux server and limited ssh, is there anyways to block a out going packet above size 65? because i don't want maybe that client to the linux server to DDoS
[07:38] <linuxn00b> Is there a seperate channel for server issues?
[07:38] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, ?
[07:38] <Zehrila> vader1102: I don't know what was the problem with my installation; everytime I tried, it gave some different error or the same error at some different stage of installation, heh.
[07:38] <Elda> bad disc?
[07:38] <malt> I limited the SSH but it still allows the user to ping
[07:38] <JoshJ> vader1102: i'll do that in the future
[07:38] <nikin> Josh: vi is a bit to evil to me :D but it isnt bad :D i prefer nano tho
[07:38] <swanand> i am currently trying to get my ubuntu 6.06 to share internet
[07:38] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: the text in that box doesn't include the line numbers
[07:38] <JoshJ> nano is basically the same as DOS edit
[07:39] <Elda> I like gedit more than nano, but nano works if gnome doenst xD
[07:39] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, ah, then im with you :)
[07:39] <linuxn00b> Hey malt are you running ubuntu server??
[07:39] <JoshJ> (in functionality and mainly in appearance)
[07:39] <malt> yes
[07:39] <Zehrila> And the disc was burnt alright, since I burnt the ISO to 4 discs, 2 copies each with different burning programs.
[07:39] <Elda> And I love this community because its the first one where people dont look down upon me for not knowing what Im doing yet :s
[07:39] <nikin> Josh: yes its true, but DOS's edit, wasnt bad
[07:39] <linuxn00b> What servers are you running?
[07:39] <Zehrila> And checked all discs before installation.
[07:39] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: yay!! it suddenly knows msttcorefonts
[07:39] <vader1102> first it was a bad drive, then all of the sudden, it don't like the blasted video, won't start x ;p;
[07:39] <needshelp> okay so i got a ubuntu live dvd i got it running, got my sata ntfs windows drive working so i can look at my media files, but it won't play them becuase i don't have the codecs. i know i can't write to the hard drive so i can't get them now, but could i somehow download the codecs for linux trough windows, save them to somewhere on the drive and have ubuntu be able to use them when i boot with it, or if not is there some way to do this.
[07:39] <nolimitsoya> swanand, check out shorewall. though, if you want a router, youd be better of using ipcop, freesco or any other distro designed for that specific purpouse
[07:39] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: great! thanks a lot
[07:39] <nolimitsoya> fgeller, np :()
[07:39] <swanand> i have adsl router connected to mu ubuntu machine
[07:39] <nolimitsoya> *-(
[07:39] <malt> apache2 with ftp and php and ssh and mysql and phpmyadmin
[07:39] <zero-1> my ubunutu machine is working fine Im just getting a kernel panic everyonce in a while, what can i do to fix it?
[07:40] <linuxn00b> malt: do you have it all working?
[07:40] <fgeller> nolimitsoya: and that without formatting my partition.. magic.. ;)
[07:40] <JoshJ> zero-1: need more details of the kernel panic
[07:40] <malt> yeah it works
[07:40] <Zehrila> So, any help with my dial-up issue?
[07:40] <zero-1> it says invalid boot parameters
[07:40] <malt> i just want to limit out going ping size
[07:40] <swanand> installation of ubuntu 6.06 was all fine...
[07:40] <malt> so they can't use ping ip -s 65000
[07:40] <knapp_> Anyone familiar with InitNG?
[07:40] <zero-1> sometimes it happens sometimes it dont
[07:41] <swanand> when i was trying to give iptables -t ... command for masquerade
[07:41] <orestyle5> linuxn00b:  most of that stuff is easily installed and running via aptitude
[07:41] <johnram> needshelp yes there is a way
[07:41] <nikin> needshelp: you can download them and they will be avilable to next restart alternatively there is a trick with USB key to install software... but i dont remember how it was
[07:41] <swanand> i got an error..
[07:41] <swanand> you must be root..
[07:41] <zero-1> but I one have one kernel image and its always the same boot arameters
[07:41] <Elda> Wonder if I should try to install Ubuntu on our home pc when I go home for the holidays xD
[07:41] <swanand> any ideas ?
[07:41] <linuxn00b> malt: Sweet Im fairly new around here and new to linux and all. I want to setup a small server for FTP and some small web hosting. I'm just not sure how it all works ...
[07:41] <Elda> Though it would have to be on a smaller partition too as my parents would probably throw the computer out the window with it ;s
[07:41] <linuxn00b> orestyle5: The problem is that ubuntu server edition does not have a gui
[07:41] <malt> i run www.m4lt.com i am learning as well
[07:42] <Elda> Not to mention I still dont know how to completely use it myself xD
[07:42] <malt> linuxnoob
[07:42] <orestyle5> linuxn00b:  that is not an issue
[07:42] <needshelp> nikin: thanks don't have a usb drive but if posibble i will try that. anybody know how to do it
[07:42] <johnram> linuxn00b just get apache and some ftp server ....
[07:42] <linuxn00b> orestyle5: Also I installed X BUT there is a problem with the viedo card on my server box, and it wont run unless it is in 8 bit
[07:42] <nolimitsoya> linuxn00b, you could always install one if you want to
[07:42] <xarq> when I do loadkeys with the dvorak keymap in /usr
[07:42] <Rookie_> why have X on a server ?
[07:42] <needshelp> i don't wanna just install ubuntu on my hdd, no room and i do'nt wanna disturb my windows, hence the live dvd
[07:42] <xarq> /share/keymaps, nothing happens.  how do I set dvorak?
[07:43] <xarq>  /share/keymaps, nothing happens.  how do I set dvorak?
[07:43] <orestyle5> linuxn00b:  basically to get some of the basic packages, we use other apt sources like dotdeb for our php5, phpmyadmin, mysql-server-5.0 and others
[07:43] <johnram> needshelp mplayer has codecs for download,and you can use it to play your media files,or there are distros aspecially for playing only your media files like movix or other distros like that. ..
[07:43] <JoshJ> uh
[07:43] <orestyle5> linuxn00b:  it actually seems easier without GUI
[07:43] <Smotang> Hey I have a USB and I cannot change the permissions on it, does anyone know how to do this?

[07:44] <linuxn00b> orestyle5: I know thats the point... I figured I would learn linux faster if i am forced to use the CP. Thats why I have a desktop ubuntu edgy and now a server i want to implement so I learn the CP. I'm just super noob and I have no idea what Im doing hehe
[07:44] <firebird619> binarydigit: Could you take a look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35154/ and help me get Ubuntu to use my monitor's native resolution?

[07:47] <needshelp> johnram:thank you but i can't download anything because i have a ntfs partition and i can't write to it right?
[07:48] <linuxn00b> malt: I responded to you PM
[07:48] <nikin> needshelp, you can download to your home dir
[07:48] <needshelp> ty nikin: i will probably go out and get a cheap usb drive later
[07:48] <needshelp> wait. what about the home dir
[07:49] <nikin> Ubuntu Live CD creates a RAM disk for file storage
[07:49] <malt> linuxn00b you have to register to message me on freenode
[07:49] <orestyle5> so if you have a ntfs partition on your linux machine, how would you connect to it?  Mount -t cifs?
[07:49] <nikin> it will store stuff til next restart
[07:49] <nikin> :D
[07:49] <strabes> anyone know why my ipod no longer shows up on my desktop when plugged in and mounted? It shows up in nautilus and the places menu. Other mounted volumes (my shared ext3 partition) do show up on the desktop.

[07:50] <needshelp> what is the path to this drive
[07:50] <JoshJ> fascinating
[07:51] <snid> i have this weird problem... im not sure if its fluxbox, or xorg.. i have these keys configured to switch workspace, and sometimes, randomly, after pressing one of these keys, fluxbox will go into a loop of quickly changing workspace as if i am holding down the key to change, although i cannot stop it from rapidly changing workspace and have to wait ~5 or 10 minutes until it finally stops... and then my ALT key is held down and when i open up a
[07:51] <snid>  virtual on screen keyboard i can see that the ALT key is in a pressed down state and i cant reverse this without restarting xorg. any suggestions on where to start?
[07:51] <umista> so is there anyone here that knows anything about nforce4 RAID0 drives?
[07:52] <vader1102> umista, I run a dual p1 200 running RAID 5....... anything I can help with?
[07:52] <nikin> snid: dows this occure with other usage of ALT key to?
[07:52] <orestyle5> umista:  what is nforce4?  Is that a controller?
[07:53] <nikin> nf4 is a motherboard chipset
[07:53] <snid> nikin: no it doesnt
[07:53] <strabes> anyone know why my ipod no longer shows up on my desktop when plugged in and mounted? It shows up in nautilus and the places menu. Other mounted volumes (my shared ext3 partition) do show up on the desktop.
[07:53] <nikin> snid: did you try other WM?
[07:53] <umista> nfrorce4 raid controller! u know wht nvidia is?
[07:53] <vader1102> strabes, have you rebooted after possibly removing it unsafely?
[07:54] <vader1102> umista, what is the problem?
[07:54] <workbean> guys, I got a router, so I want disable the pppoe connection in Ubuntu. I configured it through pppoeconf but I can't figure out how to disable it.
[07:54] <snid> nikin: yes, but i cant reproduce it... it just happens randomly
[07:54] <malt> anyone know how to block the ping command in ssh? or to atleast limit its max Packet size to 65?
=== linuxn00b is now known as saltydog
[07:54] <malt> where anything over that it will deny
[07:54] <orestyle5> umista:  why would nfrorce4 have anything to dowith raid then?
=== saltydog is now known as s4ltydog
[07:55] <nikin> snid: if you have time, and patience to use an other WM for some time... you could test it
[07:56] <umista> cause im using sata 80gig X2 drives in raid 0 and wish to know how to mount them so i can access them
[07:56] <Elda> After playing with this gui and beryl I wonder how MS thinks that they are doing something new with their gui, lol
[07:56] <yuesefa> i can not find my configuration editor in the system tools
[07:56] <yuesefa> where can i find it?
[07:56] <Elda> And I wonder why theirs eats so much cpu >.<
[07:56] <yuesefa> thanks
[07:56] <vader1102> so you didn't do the install to them umista ?
[07:56] <tiptip> a little  question, how i mount a sata disk that on /dev/sda2 ??
[07:56] <orestyle5> umista: mount -t /dev/"drive" /mnt/whatever
[07:56] <vader1102> I wonder why Ubuntu didn't see them on the first boot
[07:56] <nekostar> hey
[07:57] <nekostar> does the ubuntu ppc port have nvidia drivers?
[07:57] <skmidry> I'm facing problems with locale settings
[07:57] <skmidry> Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library
[07:57] <nekostar> and if so could one put ubuntu in a ps3 ?
[07:57] <skmidry>  Using the fallback 'C' locale
[07:57] <snid> nikin: do you know how or where i would be able to find out how this problem occurs? like is there a log i should look at or something?
[07:57] <skmidry> This is both on dapper and edgy
[07:57] <JoshJ> nekostar: you can put any distro of linux on anything if there's enough hard drive space and you have enough free time (and knowledge)
[07:57] <tiptip> what i need to write in the "whatever" ?
[07:57] <tiptip> :D
[07:57] <Elda> PS3 is eeeevil >.<
[07:57] <snid> nikin: i never had this problem before xorg 7.1... so im thinking it might be something to do with that?
[07:57] <nekostar> JoshJ,
[07:58] <nekostar> i mean is the architecture of the ppc based cell cpu in the ps3 able to run ppc stuff
[07:58] <jimle> !beryl
[07:58] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[07:58] <nekostar> and if so is there nvidia drivers in the ppc port of ubuntu
[07:58] <nekostar> o:
[07:58] <Elda> I know that the xbox can, hehe
[07:58] <JoshJ> i dunno, ask the yellowdog linux people
[07:58] <Elda> <3 Beryl
[07:58] <nikin> snid: it can be, but i think that enlightment has some problems
[07:58] <nikin> but i ame realy not sure
[07:58] <yuesefa> i installed configuration editor, but i can't where to start it
[07:59] <strabes> vader1102: earlier today i did remove it unsafely and have rebooted my computer. Would I have to reboot my computer while the ipod is plugged in?
[07:59] <Elda> Err you mean beryl?
[07:59] <yuesefa> no icon in the System tools
[07:59] <umista> na have them as windows drive
[07:59] <Elda> You have to install emerald and beryl
[07:59] <nolimitsoya> yuesefa, usualy you just type the name of the app in a terminal
[07:59] <orestyle5> tiptip:  you create a file called /mnt/"name of mount"
[07:59] <Elda> Emerald is a theme picker type thing and beryl is the thing that allows you to make your desktop into a cube
[07:59] <nekostar> JoshJ,
[07:59] <nekostar> it seems that the yd ppl suck atm
[07:59] <nekostar> lol
[07:59] <nekostar> there are few ppl in the chan
[07:59] <nikin> snid: i cant look now, coz now i ame on my server coz of upgrade of the main system and Elinks is the most powerfullwebbrowser what i can use here :D
[08:00] <nekostar> which is why im asking if anyone here knows
[08:00] <vader1102> strabes, I would have thought that since you rebooted once, that would have reset the usb ports. Maybe make sure that the IPOD is on and then if it don't show, reboot and show it who is boss
[08:00] <yuesefa> nolimitsoya: thanks, it works :)
[08:00] <nekostar> at this point it is easy to say and observe that you dont know.. it seems one can install ubuntu however from some of the documentation that ive found online.... but the real question is does said port of ubuntu have any nvidia driver support
[08:00] <nolimitsoya> yuesefa, np :)
[08:00] <nekostar> soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[08:00] <snid> nikin: ok then... thanks for your help anyways
[08:01] <nikin> nm
[08:01] <nekostar> know where i might look for the ppc package list for ubuntu ?
[08:01] <JoshJ> nekostar: i would assume the default ppc ubuntu would have access to the nvidia drivers
[08:01] <strabes> vader1102: it does show up in the places menu, etc. It just doesn't show up on my desktop which is what I am trying to get it to do. volumes_visible IS checked in gconf-editor/apps/nautilus
[08:01] <JoshJ> mainly because it's the same sources.list file
[08:01] <tiptip> hmm, sudo mount -t /dev/sda2 /mnt/whatever doesnt work for me  :/
[08:01] <swanand> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[08:01] <swanand> i was trying above..
[08:01] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, but the repos arent the same :)
[08:01] <swanand> and the message is permission denied
[08:01] <nekostar> but JoshJ you should have learned by now not to assume that sort of thing
[08:01] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, different architectures mean different binaries
[08:01] <vader1102> strabes, then I honestly don't know, sorry to have waisted your time :(
[08:01] <nekostar> not to flame or make fun but when you assume you make an ass out of you and me
[08:02] <nekostar> ^_^
[08:02] <JoshJ> ah, hrm
[08:02] <strabes> vader1102: that's ok. It's spelled "wasted" btw :)
[08:02] <orestyle5> tiptip:  you can run mount -a then do a df -k and see if that mount is showing
[08:02] <vader1102> lol woops
[08:02] <nekostar> nolimitsoya, is there a spot that lists packages per port?
[08:02] <nolimitsoya> nekostar, i have no idea :)
[08:02] <JoshJ> seems odd that it's not a different repository url...
[08:02] <JoshJ> deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy-updates main restricted
[08:02] <JoshJ> that doesn't say anything about x86 or amd or ppc :(
[08:05] <swanand> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward... command gives me persmission denied error..can anyone help ?

[08:11] <DARKGuy> and, are you using Dapper or Edgy?
[08:12] <con-man> edgy
[08:12] <con-man> i dont know if i have those enabled
[08:12] <DARKGuy> con-man: Okay, edit (the same way you did with xorg.conf) the file named /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:12] <con-man> and add?
[08:12] <g0tw00d> Does ubuntu support SATA harddrives and SATA CDROMS?  I can't seem to get it to boot the live cd.....
[08:13] <g0tw00d> errors on sr0
[08:13] <DARKGuy> con-man: see where it says something with deb://http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe ?
[08:13] <con-man> yeah
[08:13] <DARKGuy> con-man: Remove the #'s before those two lines
[08:13] <DARKGuy> then save, do sudo apt-get update, and again try to install xinerama
[08:14] <Firefishe> is xinerama that 3d desktop thing  I've been hearing about?
[08:14] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: No, that's Beryl
[08:15] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: Xinerama just spans two or more displays in a big desktop as if it was one
[08:15] <con-man> still doesnt work
[08:15] <g0tw00d> like dual monitors for xp?
[08:15] <DARKGuy> g0tw00d: yes
[08:15] <con-man> yeah
[08:15] <DARKGuy> con-man: Hm..
[08:15] <g0tw00d> kewl
[08:15] <DARKGuy> con-man: one sec
[08:15] <g0tw00d> nice to know that
[08:15] <DARKGuy> g0tw00d: In fact, I'm talking to you all through my right monitor :P
[08:16] <g0tw00d> right on....dual monitors kicks ass I just dont use it
[08:16] <g0tw00d> i figured i could use it at the office someday
[08:16] <DARKGuy> It's cool :P
[08:16] <con-man> i cant wait to get it set up
[08:16] <DARKGuy> con-man: try to follow the instructions here
[08:16] <DARKGuy> con-man: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_add_extra_repositories
[08:16] <g0tw00d> i have set clients up for dual monitors on xp....
[08:17] <g0tw00d> cpas
[08:17] <DARKGuy> con-man: After that, sudo apt-get update, and try installing xinerama again
[08:17] <g0tw00d> cpa's
[08:17] <Firefishe> !beryl
[08:17] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[08:17] <DARKGuy> g0tw00d: dual rocks, and even more if there's hardware accel in both monitors ;)
[08:18] <con-man> i know how to add repositories
[08:18] <DARKGuy> con-man: But you've got to add the ones in that list :P
[08:18] <JoshJ> did he know you knew that?
[08:18] <g0tw00d> DARKGuy: ever used Ubuntu on SATA HD's and SATA CD-ROM's?
[08:19] <DARKGuy> g0tw00d: Nope, I only have IDE drives :(
[08:19] <fnf> I'm running the free vmware player with Windows XP as guest, is there anyway to share data between the host and the guest (mounting addtion partition, smb, nfs, etc...) ?.
[08:19] <Skelator> hi, how do I reconfigure fontconfig?
=== [1] surferdude is now known as surferdude
[08:19] <DARKGuy> g0tw00d: I'm sorry
[08:19] <orestyle5> any ideas on a good IRC program?  This chatzilla not the best
[08:19] <g0tw00d> DARKGuy:ok nm, thx anyway :)
[08:19] <JoshJ> xchat!
[08:19] <fnf> orestyle5: What do you want from an IRC client ?
[08:19] <DARKGuy> orestyle5: you like terminal? try irssi or BitchX. You like gui?XChat is the way
[08:20] <DARKGuy> fnf: I've not used vmware player in linux, but in windows I know there was a way to set up shared folders between the two o.O
[08:20] <strabes> orestyle5: i really like lostirc - it's really small and compact
[08:20] <orestyle5> I used to use leafchat with win, but when I setup bitchx the cpu basically ran all the time
[08:20] <JoshJ> i remember there was SOMETHING i disliked strongly about lostirc
[08:20] <Skelator> nm, I got an answer: sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config
[08:20] <JoshJ> can't remember what the hell it was though >_<
[08:21] <JoshJ> i do remember that ksirc had copy-paste issues
[08:21] <fnf> DARKGuy: Can you draw a simple direction ? That would probably give me a clue. I pinged the guest OS but all ports are closed.
[08:21] <strabes> JoshJ: i haven't had any problems with copy/paste in lostirc. maybe the problem is that you can't handle the sweetness of this irc program
[08:21] <orestyle5> Ya, just something that is simple to use, remembers the channels I have been too, and maybe can log the channels for later review..
[08:21] <JoshJ> strabes: ksirc != lostirc, read what i said again
[08:21] <orestyle5> and not processor intensive
[08:21] <DARKGuy> fnf: Hm, in the VMWare program itself, not the player (where you make the VM) you need to install VM Additions in the guest OS and then from there you can set up the shared folders
[08:21] <fnf> orestyle5: Try centericq.
[08:21] <JoshJ> also, what does lostirc support with regard to scripting?
[08:21] <strabes> JoshJ: i know; i was just saying...
[08:21] <DARKGuy> fnf: At least I did it like that in XP using 98 as guest
[08:22] <strabes> orestyle5: not sure if lostirc has log capabilities
[08:22] <bitflip> LOL!  what a fsck - he doesn't get it an will forever be married to failure due to ignorance
[08:22] <orestyle5> ok
[08:22] <strabes> orestyle5: actually it does; i just checked
[08:22] <orestyle5> sweet
[08:22] <Firefishe> I'll stick to good ol' xchat :)
[08:22] <fnf> DARKGuy: I'll check if I can find where to download the VMWare tools, I ahve heard of it but never installed.
[08:22] <bitflip> um, please disregard (wrong channel)
[08:22] <DARKGuy> fnf: you need those for sharing folders
[08:22] <JoshJ> i <3 xchat and i'm sorta trying to script some stuff in python for it :)
[08:22] <JoshJ> (a game bot0
[08:22] <JoshJ> )
[08:22] <strabes> xchat has that useless side panel channel list on the left =\ lostirc puts them in tabs on the bottom
[08:23] <DARKGuy> ahhhH! ants in my desk D:
[08:23] <strabes> DARKGuy: pwned!!!!
[08:23] <JoshJ> strabes: that's an option
[08:23] <JoshJ> mine are across the top
[08:23] <DARKGuy> strabes: lol!
[08:23] <strabes> JoshJ: oh that's cool
[08:23] <fnf> DARKGuy: That's probably the difference between VMWare workstation and the free one, give me a minute...
[08:23] <DARKGuy> xchat can put tabs at the bottom, too strabes
[08:23] <orestyle5> this chatzilla is making me crazy.  I thought it would be nice, but kinda clunky
[08:23] <JoshJ> yeah... that's not really a big deal
[08:23] <DARKGuy> fnf: could be o.o
[08:23] <strabes> DARKGuy: cool i'm gonna check it out
[08:23] <JoshJ> chatzilla was clunky and awful for me
[08:23] <DARKGuy> strabes: just check the options ;)
[08:23] <JoshJ> i tried out like... 9 irc clients, i think
[08:24] <JoshJ> when i switched from windows/mirc to linux
[08:24] <JoshJ> ksirc, lostirc, irssi, bitchx, xchat, konversation, and a few others
[08:24] <orestyle5> I used to love the mirc stuff
[08:24] <DARKGuy> JoshJ: what about emulating mirc in Wine? xD
[08:24] <JoshJ> ew no
[08:24] <DARKGuy> :(
[08:24] <strabes> DARKGuy: WOW why would you want to do that
[08:24] <fnf> DARKGuy: Did you have to download the tools separately, or it was included in the workstation edition ?
[08:24] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, can you arrange the channels as you like with xchat? last time i tried, it put them alphabeticaly, categorized by server. thats uncool :/
[08:24] <DARKGuy> strabes: dunno, it's a way to still use mirc in linux :p
[08:24] <orestyle5> you having to crack mirc or is it free?
[08:24] <JoshJ> xchat lets you reaarrange
[08:24] <quik_> hey folks
[08:25] <JoshJ> mirc is free as in beer for 30 days then a nag screen
[08:25] <DARKGuy> fnf: it was included as ISO
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, how?
[08:25] <JoshJ> alt-left/right can move channels within a server
[08:25] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: Hm, I really have no much idea about it... I could try firing it up and checking
[08:25] <quik_> if I have a script that requires to be run from a while the user is within a particular directory
[08:25] <orestyle5> good ol nag screen.  Just like ol times
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, but out of the server tabs then?(or even do away with them in full)
[08:25] <JoshJ> you can do control-i i think
[08:25] <JoshJ> yeah...
[08:25] <JoshJ> that pops the window separately
[08:25] <quik_> its a shell script that a particular process has to be run from a directory
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, exelent. i might try xchat again :D
[08:25] <JoshJ> and they're ordered sequentially by time you loaded it, not by default
[08:26] <JoshJ> *alpha
[08:26] <fnf> DARKGuy: I see... Probably there's no equivalent tools with vmware player, I read the documentation for vmware Workstation and saw quite a few menus lacking in the free version.
[08:26] <quik_> in that shell script, will 'cd my_dir; my_command' work?
[08:26] <JoshJ> as in, if i /join #ubuntu then #beryl then ##linux they're in that order
[08:26] <fnf> DARKGuy: Thanks.
[08:26] <DARKGuy> fnf: Ah, it could be that, I'm sorry :( - welcome :)
[08:27] <DARKGuy> fnf: Google is your friend :) who knows, maybe someone has set up shared folders without it? o.o;
[08:27] <fnf> DARKGuy: I'm trying :).

[08:30] <screechingcat> can anyone tell me which program is the best GUI for mencoder ?
[08:30] <JoshJ> seems like it would be mplayer
[08:31] <screechingcat> ive tried to install konverter and gmencoder, but both had some unsatisfiable deps
[08:31] <JoshJ> mencoder - MPlayer's Movie Encoder
[08:31] <JoshJ> !mencoder
[08:31] <ubotu> mencoder: MPlayer's Movie Encoder. In component multiverse, is extra. Version 2:0.99+1.0pre8-0ubuntu8 (edgy), package size 3171 kB, installed size 7956 kB
[08:31] <JoshJ> unless i'm missing something :(
[08:31] <drcode> hi all
[08:31] <orestyle5__> JoshJ:  xchat seems ok.  Like the layout
[08:31] <drcode> is there dvd with all ubuntu 6.10 packges?
[08:31] <drcode> I have computer without internet connection
[08:31] <screechingcat> JoshJ: mplayer doesnt do all the encoding and ripping features that mencoder gives
[08:32] <drcode> or place where I can download spcific pkges for 6.10
[08:32] <screechingcat> JoshJ: mplayer is just for playing media
[08:32] <phobiac> I've got an ntfs partition I'm considering just nuking and turning into ext3 so I can take full advantage of it with ubuntu. Is using gparted to reformat it from ntfs to ext3 a good move, or will I end up destroying the semi-vaulable data on it?
[08:32] <JoshJ> screechingcat: sorry, dunno -i've never made a video on ubuntu
[08:32] <con-man> i need help
[08:32] <JoshJ> phobiac: reformatting ALWAYS nukes data
[08:32] <DARKGuy> drcode: you can download packages directly from the mirrors - but isn't too reccommended for tons of package downloading... y'know, they give bandwidth for free
[08:32] <con-man> im trying to run this program using WINE and i get this message
[08:32] <con-man> con-man@con-man-desktop:~/media/Miranda IM$ wine miranda32.exe
[08:32] <con-man> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":1.0".
[08:32] <con-man> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":1.0".
[08:32] <DARKGuy> con-man: what with?
[08:33] <DARKGuy> con-man: Weird
[08:33] <con-man> ideas?
[08:33] <drcode> k
[08:33] <DARKGuy> con-man: try... "DISPLAY=:0.0 && wine miranda32.exe"
[08:33] <phobiac> Hmm,okay. Thanks.
[08:33] <screechingcat> con-man: why bother with an IM program under wine ? just use gaim or kopete. they're awesome
[08:33] <JoshJ> gaim is awesome indeed
[08:33] <phobiac> Con-man, can you display 3d things properly?
[08:33] <DARKGuy> it lacks some features, but it is
[08:34] <con-man> yeah
[08:34] <con-man> totally
[08:34] <DARKGuy> I wonder, once again, how can I remove tty-6 ?
[08:34] <DARKGuy> *tty4-6
[08:34] <con-man> it isnt loading my exe
[08:34] <con-man> just drops to a prompt
[08:34] <phobiac> When I was trying to set up beryl I got that error messege before setting up my ATI card properly.
[08:34] <JoshJ> DARKGuy i'm not even sure you would even gain anything out of doing that
[08:35] <JoshJ> i don't think those extra tty's slow your system down
[08:35] <phobiac> Try opening up a terminal and doing 'sudo wine [path to program here] '
[08:35] <JoshJ> uh
[08:35] <JoshJ> why would you give a windows program root access?
[08:35] <JoshJ> that's asking for trouble :|
[08:35] <con-man> i just want it to load
[08:36] <phobiac> It's just a im program. It's not like all windows programs are infused with the devil.
[08:36] <screechingcat> con-man: what is the program ?
[08:36] <JoshJ> oh btw DARKGuy
[08:36] <DARKGuy> JoshJ: Then, would you know why this box is eating 242Mb out of 256Mb with just Fluxbox, 2Eterms, an Xterm (just showing top), XMMS and 6dockapps in fluxbox?
[08:36] <JoshJ> do ps -e
[08:36] <DARKGuy> like, it shouldn't :/
[08:36] <JoshJ> or you can do killall tty4 , tty5, and tty6 :\
[08:36] <JoshJ> not sure if that will cause a crash
[08:36] <JoshJ> probably shouldn't, but might
[08:36] <DARKGuy> nope, I tried
[08:36] <screechingcat> phobiac: lucifer personally created all of them (cept firefox of course)
[08:36] <JoshJ> how odd
[08:36] <DARKGuy> but they come back 
[08:36] <JoshJ> yeah figured
[08:37] <JoshJ> 242 megs seems pretty high
[08:37] <DARKGuy> a lot, considering how "lightweight" this should be
[08:37] <DARKGuy> Actually
[08:37] <JoshJ> but then again i'm using 300+ megs constantly
[08:37] <JoshJ> (granted i have firefox gaim and xchat open)
[08:37] <DARKGuy> let me restart and see how much RAM does it takes at first initial X boot
[08:37] <JoshJ> k
[08:38] <JoshJ> no, i'm not saying "all windows apps are made by luciver" screechingcat
[08:38] <JoshJ> but i'm fairly sure that running windows apps as root is a Bad Idea
[08:38] <phobiac> Anyone know what the 'force' mount option is when trying to mount an ntfs partition?
[08:39] <H3g3m0n> phobiac: I think it allows you to mount it even if the journel isn't clean
[08:39] <screechingcat> JoshJ: no you're not sayying that. i am
[08:39] <JoshJ> heh
[08:39] <JoshJ> that's a silly exaggeration
[08:39] <screechingcat> JoshJ: just a joke
[08:39] <JoshJ> osswin.sourceforge.net can show you the light :P
[08:39] <phobiac> When I attempt to mount it with a 'sudo mount' it says to reboot windows twice or use the force mount option.
[08:40] <phobiac> Oh wait, no no, what I'm asking for is the actual argument. I can't find it.
[08:40] <screechingcat> JoshJ: Warez has already given me all the light i need
[08:40] <phobiac> a mount --help and man mount didn't help. :(
[08:40] <JoshJ> screechingcat: no reason to use Warez if FOSS is available
[08:40] <orestyle5__> phobiac:  is it a local ntfs file system or on network?
[08:41] <JoshJ> hrm, man mount | grep force gets nothing relevant :\
[08:41] <kurisutofuaa> Does any one know of any programs for minidics player support?
[08:41] <screechingcat> JoshJ: naah! im not a FOSS addict. i just need the best program for the job
[08:41] <phobiac> orestyle5__: It's local, a partition on my HD.
[08:41] <al> %C7 Hello
[08:41] <al> i got a problem here
[08:41] <JoshJ> screechingcat; curious, what program do you find necessary to use instead of FOSS?
[08:42] <firebird619> My monitors native resolution is 1680x1050, but in system, preferences, screen resolution the highest listed is 1280x1024, however 1680x1050 is listed in xorg.conf. How can I fix this? Is it possible my graphics card doesn't support it, I have Intel 845GL with i810 driver.
[08:42] <FirstStrike> al: just ask your question
[08:42] <orestyle5__> phobiac:  there is a document on the ubuntu site that explains mounting local ntfs partitions...  let me see
[08:42] <al> huh , thank you
[08:42] <sean_> Need help, cant startx API mismatch nvidia kernel module older than X module, after running nvidia installer, thoughts?
[08:42] <al> I'm on ubuntu x64
[08:42] <FirstStrike> !mount
[08:42] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[08:42] <phobiac> orestyle5__: Alright, thanks for the help.
[08:42] <orestyle5__> phobiac:  maybe this helps  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[08:43] <al> and here i can not play any .rmvb videos
[08:43] <al> win32codec didn't working
[08:43] <screechingcat> JoshJ: a driver manager, antivirus, antispyware, nero, and some video editing software and games
[08:43] <JoshJ> there isn't FOSS antivirus/antispyware for windows?
[08:43] <JoshJ> nero and drivers, sure
[08:43] <JoshJ> games, sure- windows is the system everything goes to for games...
[08:43] <al> what can i do to turn on the rmvb format on x64 ubuntu
[08:44] <JoshJ> video editing, i guess...
[08:44] <JoshJ> i'm a bit baffled that you're "having" to use proprietary antivirus/antispyware
[08:44] <Bonez56> hi all, i installed edgy on my PC and now when I boot it says grub error 22, no partition found
[08:44] <neil> hi all
[08:44] <nolimitsoya> al, try vlc
[08:44] <screechingcat> JoshJ: why is that ? are there a lot of FOSS antivirus apps ?
[08:44] <DARKGuy> woot
[08:44] <DARKGuy> 99Mb free out of 256 :/
[08:45] <al> vlc? what is that?
[08:45] <JoshJ> !vlc
[08:45] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[08:45] <neil> quick, terminal command to change permissions on my themes folder
[08:45] <JoshJ> i would expect there to be, screechingcat
[08:45] <JoshJ> chmod
[08:45] <Bonez56> hi all, i installed edgy on my PC and now when I boot it says grub error 22, no partition found. can someone please help?
[08:45] <JoshJ> probably prefixed by a sudo
[08:45] <al> grub error 22 might be Harddisk partition forum error
[08:45] <screechingcat> JoshJ: all i know about is ClamAV and i've never really tried that
[08:45] <al> fix it by using the diskman
[08:45] <JoshJ> http://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&words=antivirus
[08:45] <Bonez56> al: what is the diskman
[08:45] <JoshJ> the first one on the list (moon) is for windows
[08:45] <JoshJ> the second one (clam) is for linux
[08:46] <JoshJ> the 4th one is the windows version of clam
[08:46] <al> now it called diskger&*87?
[08:46] <al> diskgenius
[08:46] <Bonez56> ?
[08:46] <JoshJ> http://sourceforge.net/projects/antixtra/  <-anti-spyware
[08:46] <al> Diskgenius
[08:46] <phobiac> Aha, for anyone interested to force the mount of an ntfs partition that needs checking just do -o force as an arguement.
[08:46] <Bonez56> what do i need it for
[08:46] <phobiac> Well, I'm off.
[08:46] <JoshJ> my method of getting software is (1) apt-cache search (2) sourceforge (3) google
[08:46] <al> burn it to a bootable disk
[08:46] <DARKGuy> XMMS & Gaim = 64Mb free
[08:47] <DARKGuy> this can't be :/
[08:47] <screechingcat> JoshJ: yeah i try google and synaptic too
[08:47] <orestyle5__> JoshJ:  Don't forget freshmeat...
[08:47] <orestyle5__> might be similar to sourceforge
[08:47] <al> hello nolimitsoya , what vlc? a player?
[08:47] <screechingcat> JoshJ: yeah, the often underestimated kid brother of sourceforge
[08:47] <nolimitsoya> al, yes
[08:48] <JoshJ> ah, yeah, i do tend to forget about that
[08:48] <al> could that work fine on x64?
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> al, type 'sudo apt-get install vlc' in a terminal
[08:48] <screechingcat> al, its a media player. get it at videolan.org
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> screechingcat, no!
[08:48] <JoshJ> getting it out of the repos > getting it from a website
[08:48] <al> ok, thank you
[08:48] <JoshJ> that's always true
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> +1 JoshJ
[08:48] <zcat[1] > sourceforget, the world's largets repository of barely started abandoned software projects
[08:48] <screechingcat> JoshJ: the website points to the apt-get command anywyas
[08:48] <zcat[1] > *largest
[08:48] <FirstStrike> al: if you use aptitude you can install VLC or MPlayer straight from the repositories
[08:49] <neil> so, sudo chmod user/share/themes
[08:49] <al> ok
[08:49] <FirstStrike> I personally find that MPlayer works better than VLC
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> neil, youll have to give chmod som sort of command as well ;)
[08:49] <neil> example?
[08:49] <screechingcat> i have mplayer, vlc and totem-xine
[08:49] <screechingcat> i can play anything
[08:49] <al> I hadnt ever heard about this , vlc, what kind of it  ?  a gtk program?
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> al, just type the string i gave you, and disregard all other "advice" :)
[08:49] <DARKGuy> wait - wtf
[08:49] <yuesefa> after upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10, too many choices on the boot list. How can i delete the old versions?
[08:49] <DARKGuy> does Ubuntu makes you a swap partition ?
[08:49] <FirstStrike> !vlc
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, i can...

[08:50] <nolimitsoya> yuesefa, just uninstall the kernels you dont want anymore
[08:50] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: you can.. what o.o;?
[08:50] <FirstStrike> al: it's a GUI video player. it will play multiple formats 'out of the box'
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, sorry, dropped a letter. should have been 'it can'
[08:50] <al> thank you
[08:51] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: Ah, 'cause I don't see it in df -h :/
[08:51] <neil> nolimitsoya, example?
[08:51] <FirstStrike> al: type sudo aptitude install vlc in a command prompt

[08:51] <DARKGuy> nolimitsoya: oh wait, it did, nevermind
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> al, dont do both. as i said, disregard everyone else ;)
[08:52] <al> I think Linux is great now, no so many games on it, but those just waste life
[08:52] <screechingcat> i dont like aptitude
[08:52] <bitflip> yuesefa: comment out the kernels in /boot/grub/menu.lst or do what nolimitsoya suggested
[08:52] <al> ok , thank you
[08:52] <kurisutofuaa> Does any one know of any programs for minidics player support for edgy amd64?

[08:54] <al> i like FEAR more
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> but this is #ubuntu-offtopic material :P
[08:54] <FirstStrike> well, UT2k4 has a native version
[08:54] <FirstStrike> so that doesn't count i suppose
[08:54] <al> .......

[08:54] <DARKGuy> !
[08:55] <ubuntu_noob> Hello Peeps
[08:55] <DARKGuy> how do you mount an ISO FirstStrike ?
[08:55] <ubuntu_noob> My First Linux Boot! Woohoo!
[08:55] <FirstStrike> DARKGuy: with the mount command
[08:55] <nolimitsoya> DARKGuy, sudo mount -o loop /file /mount(point
[08:55] <DARKGuy> FirstStrike: yup, but what c- oh, thanks nolimitsoya :D
[08:55] <FirstStrike> yea, that
[08:56] <nolimitsoya> cheers ubuntu_noob :)
[08:56] <FirstStrike> ubuntu_noob: congrats. don't break anything :P
[08:56] <ubuntu_noob> thanks man i'm so proud i could die
[08:56] <FirstStrike> actually, break the hell out of it so you learn
[08:56] <Microsoft_Spy> Hmmm got a new notebook Acer Travelmate 4220
[08:56] <Elda> Night all xD
[08:56] <ubuntu_noob> itsa live cd so not much to break hehehe
[08:56] <FirstStrike> oh, livecd's don't count
[08:56] <DARKGuy> nice ubuntu_noob, welcome to the jungle ;)
[08:56] <Microsoft_Spy> Ubuntu edgy doesn't support wireless
[08:56] <screechingcat> ive broken Ubuntu a gazillion times
[08:57] <nolimitsoya> !wifi | Microsoft_Spy
[08:57] <ubotu> Microsoft_Spy: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[08:57] <JoshJ> ubuntu edgy does support wireless
[08:57] <DARKGuy> it's fun to break it
[08:57] <DARKGuy> :D
[08:57] <al> I try to start Azureus, and got the following error: No SSL provider available
[08:57] <al> what's up
[08:57] <JoshJ> it's just that broadcom sucks :(
[08:57] <sean_> broke edgy 3 times today
[08:57] <FirstStrike> i think you need openssl installed for azureus al
[08:57] <orestyle5> Ah, broadcom
[08:57] <DARKGuy> you went too edgy :P
[08:57] <JoshJ> i think you're reaking things too much :P
[08:57] <sean_> still broke - why I'm here
[08:57] <ubuntu_noob> i have one question already...  I stuck in a lexar drive and it was immediately seen as /media/LEXAR MEDIA
[08:57] <screechingcat> al, i never could start azureus without an error message
[08:57] <al> openssl, ok
[08:57] <DARKGuy> behold the power of auto USB
[08:57] <Microsoft_Spy> Thank ubotu
[08:58] <screechingcat> al, try ktorrent
[08:58] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu_noob, the question being?
[08:58] <al> :] 
[08:58] <FirstStrike> if you install azureus through the repositories it should be perfect
[08:58] <FirstStrike> i've never had an issue with it
[08:58] <ubuntu_noob> however, i cant execute stuff on it
[08:58] <ubuntu_noob> looks like my permissions are screwed
[08:58] <al> ktorrent is so terrible, crash each time
[08:58] <screechingcat> FirstStrike: i had errors even thru a repo install
[08:58] <BrokenPipe> Can anyone give me LVM advice?
[08:58] <FirstStrike> interesting
[08:58] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu_noob, windows binaries dont work in windows. also, you need xbit set to execute
[08:59] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | BrokenPipe
[08:59] <ubotu> BrokenPipe: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:59] <screechingcat> i love ktorrent. i used to use utorrent on wine, but ktorrent is a prefect clone
[08:59] <VigoFuse> Greetings
[08:59] <JoshJ> " windows binaries dont work in windows"  <-- dude, this explains a LOT
[08:59] <zcat[1] > do removable drives get mounted noexec?
[08:59] <JoshJ> :P
[08:59] <al> bitcomet is so good
[08:59] <ubuntu_noob> yes they do get mounted noexec
[08:59] <zcat[1] > JoshJ: not what he meant, but still often true...
[08:59] <BrokenPipe> So, I'm following the LVM HOWTO, and I'm trying to do a vgextend, but I'm getting the error "No physical volume label read from /dev/sdc1 \n /dev/sdc1 not identified as an existing physical volume \n Unable to add physical volume '/dev/sdc1' to volume group 'vg0'."  Any ideas why?
[08:59] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, >_< sorry, that was a slip of the mind...
[08:59] <JoshJ> zcat[1]  : i know :P
[08:59] <ubuntu_noob> but i dont know how to undo that
[08:59] <DARKGuy> JoshJ: Lol
[08:59] <screechingcat> has microsft got any programs for linux
[09:00] <FirstStrike> haha..
[09:00] <JoshJ> yes actually
[09:00] <php-freak> Now whats gnome is that the kernal?
[09:00] <JoshJ> no
[09:00] <ubuntu_noob> uhm its not a windozer binary dude
[09:00] <JoshJ> linux is the kernel
[09:00] <JoshJ> gnome is your desktop manager
[09:00] <JoshJ> !gnome
[09:00] <ubotu> gnome is a project that provides two things: The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for end-users, users, and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop.
[09:00] <FirstStrike> microsoft switched to linux for their firewalls as well
[09:00] <DARKGuy> Interesting
[09:00] <orestyle5> Microsoft was handing out tshirts at OSCON in Portland, Oregon.  That might be considered a program for linux right?
[09:00] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu_noob, then, as i said, you need x bit set for the executable, and make sure the drive is not mounted with noexec
[09:01] <al> I find the openssl is already installed, but the Azureus still black, whats wrong?
[09:01] <ubuntu_noob> i somehow have to tell the usb drive to mount as exec
[09:01] <al> No SSL provider available
[09:01] <orestyle5> Dosen't microsoft use qmail for hotmail?
[09:01] <sean_> Question - Cant startx API mismatch nvidia kernel module older than X module, after running nvidia installer
[09:01] <christian1222> hi guys, i just installed ubuntu 6.06 (linux super beginner) and the sound does not work. I have looked online, but I cant figure it out. Any ideas?
[09:01] <zcat[1] > all MS's DNS is hosted on Akamai afaik...
[09:01] <nolimitsoya> !multimedia
[09:01] <ubotu> For multimedia codecs see: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html and for applications see this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaApplications
[09:01] <nolimitsoya> hm... thats not what i wanted :/
[09:02] <zcat[1] > and they hide behind Akamai every time they're under a DDoS attack..
[09:02] <al> but my Maya and Shake work fine, that's great
[09:02] <stephano> hello. My usplash on the start is kubuntu, and on the shutdown is ubuntu. How can i make it all to ubuntu theme?
[09:02] <JoshJ> would sudo apt-get remove kde-splash do it, or would that break something else?
[09:02] <nolimitsoya> is there still no working torrentprogram for gtk? im sick of having to run torrent trhough wine
[09:02] <orestyle5> if they dont trust microsoft software for hotmail, why should you?
[09:02] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, it would break kubuntu-desktop :P
[09:03] <JoshJ> uh...
[09:03] <JoshJ> isn't kubuntu-desktop just a metapackage?
[09:03] <nolimitsoya> bingo :)
[09:03] <yuesefa> nolimitsoya: u r a ubuntu guru. Thank u very much!
[09:03] <JoshJ> heh
[09:03] <screechingcat> nolimitsoya: bittorrent works
[09:03] <nolimitsoya> broken metapackages are a bad thing ;)
[09:03] <zcat[1] > gnome-torrent?
[09:03] <VigoFuse> JoshJ:There is a command to stop the Splash Screens,,I forgot it,but it exists
[09:03] <nolimitsoya> screechingcat, not even comparable to torrent
[09:03] <zcat[1] > gnome-btdownload sorry...
[09:03] <stephano> i've just tried to set the alternatives, and that's what i've got
[09:03] <JoshJ> someone just said something about ktorrent
[09:04] <christian1222> I just installed ubuntu 6.06 (linux super beginner) and the sound does not work. I have looked online, but I cant figure it out. Any ideas?
[09:04] <nolimitsoya> zcat[1] , same story im afraid...
[09:04] <screechingcat> nolimitsoya: yes but you asked about a working client. bittorrent works
[09:04] <JoshJ> linux super beginner, wtf?
[09:04] <ubuntu_noob> lexar media properties: "You are not the owner, so you can't change these properties" D'oh
[09:04] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, yes, but thats qt ;)
[09:04] <christian1222> yep
[09:04] <zcat[1] > I use rtorrent.. but afaik gnome-btdownload works
[09:04] <JoshJ> ubuntu_noob: use sudo?
[09:04] <screechingcat> nolimitsoya: but if you want gtk try transmission
[09:04] <ubuntu_noob> how do you sudo a mouse click?
[09:04] <JoshJ> ubuntu_noob: go in the terminal and sudo chmod or chown it? :\
[09:04] <JoshJ> not sure what you're trying to do
[09:05] <nolimitsoya> screechingcat, ill check it out. ty :)
[09:05] <ubuntu_noob> ok
[09:05] <JoshJ> so i'd like to have kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop, how do i do that without changing my splash screen off from the regular ubuntu one?
[09:05] <VigoFuse> christian1222: What Sound Device/Card are you useing?
[09:05] <nolimitsoya> !transmission
[09:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about transmission - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:07] <JoshJ> i'll figure out the splash stuff later
[09:07] <ubuntu_noob> ok i do  sudo chmod 777 test  and no error message, but it remains -rwx---------
[09:07] <stephano> JoshJ: i have the same problem as yours
[09:08] <JoshJ> that's hardly a problem...
[09:08] <JoshJ> the splash will come later :P
[09:08] <stephano> JoshJ: but i have already installed kubuntu
[09:08] <JoshJ> yes, well
[09:08] <screechingcat> JoshJ: there's some command to select usplash like sudo update-alternatives config-usplash
[09:08] <VigoFuse> JoshJ: Its somethin easy like 'sudo no-splash' or some such thing
[09:08] <guebay> I just installed Edgy. And now the updater shows me that there are updateble packages, but if I make apt-get upgrade then he gives me that packages are hold back ( http://rafb.net/paste/results/WVHD1U48.html ). How can I update them?
[09:08] <xipietotec> the instructions for adding google to deskbar seem out of date...does anyone have a clue how to do this?
[09:08] <JoshJ> tell you what, i'll figure that out later :P
[09:08] <christian1222> VigoFuse: i dont know what that is, im a big linux dummy
[09:08] <JoshJ> i'm waiting until i INSTALL kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop
[09:08] <ubuntu_noob> if a drive is mounted noexec, ho do you remount it for exec?
[09:09] <christian1222> crimsun: pastebin is taking some time, i dont know why
[09:09] <zcat[1] > mount /wherever -o remount,exec
[09:09] <stephano> screechingcat: i've tried alternatives, but on the start the splash is kubuntu and on the shutdown is ubuntu
[09:09] <VigoFuse> christian122: you and I are very alike then, I poked around and found the fglrx? thing on the Firums.
[09:09] <zcat[1] > with perhaps a sudo for luck
[09:09] <al> hello, I have VLC now, it's good to play AVI, but still not working on rmvb
[09:10] <al> just have sound but no vedio
[09:10] <guebay> How can I update "hold-back" packages , please?

[09:10] <Palish> Hey all
[09:10] <al> sorry, what can i do now
[09:10] <screechingcat> stephano: remove the kubuntu-usplash package and the ubuntu-usplash package from synaptic and then reinstall the ubuntu package
[09:10] <Palish> So I'm trying to install ubuntu.. When I boot from the cd, it reads "mount: function not implemented", and then won't go any further
[09:10] <Palish> won't boot into the installer, or anything
[09:10] <Palish> is this common?
[09:11] <desaparecidoo> Why if I change type of controls in gnome themes it doens't change?
[09:11] <christian1222> whats wrong with pastebin? its not working
[09:11] <christian1222> is there an easy alternative
[09:11] <JoshJ> try rafb.net/paste instead
[09:11] <nolimitsoya> Palish, id say no. :) check the media
[09:11] <zcat[1] > ubuntu_noob: sudo mount / media/LEXAR MEDIA -o remount,exec
[09:11] <JoshJ> i find that it's faster myself
[09:11] <stephano> screechingcat: it wants to delete kubuntu-desktop then.
[09:11] <VigoFuse> christian1222: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=204910 <<thats not your fix, but its a start in the right direction

[09:11] <christian1222> VigoFuse: Thanks, ill check it out
[09:11] <xipietotec> I can't find this developer key they're talking about (To integrate google into deskbar applet)
[09:11] <screechingcat> stephano: no prob. thats just a metpackage. go ahead
[09:11] <VigoFuse> :-)
[09:11] <nolimitsoya> Palish, check if there is a bug filed on lanchpad, and try the alternate install cd
[09:12] <nolimitsoya> Palish, also, if its a rw, try a r. some drives are picky about booting rw:s
[09:12] <VigoFuse> The gns guys kinda funny tonight.
[09:12] <umista> where can i learn about making some scripts
[09:12] <Palish> my problem is like, exactly this guy's, nolimitsoya: http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies-archive.cfm/626835.html
[09:12] <nolimitsoya> umista, scripts?
[09:13] <Palish> seems like not a CD issue
[09:13] <xipietotec> anyone?
[09:13] <nolimitsoya> Palish, try the alternate cd then
[09:13] <Palish> Ok  :(
[09:13] <umista> yea so i make somthing to do a bunch of commands in one go
[09:13] <Palish> is there a way of booting from a CD without burning a CD? Hehe
[09:13] <Palish> I have no more blank CD's.. Just ran out
[09:13] <nolimitsoya> umista, try 'man bash'
[09:13] <christian1222> crimsun: http://rafb.net/paste/results/nnypjG23.html
[09:14] <nolimitsoya> umista, otherwise, you can just separate each command with &&, fex 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop'
[09:14] <guebay> What does it mean that packages are "hold back " ? That they will be updated in the next time/try?
[09:14] <guebay> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions

[09:15] <guebay> nolimitsoya: I tried that but he don't update them
[09:15] <screechingcat> guebay: it means there is some conflict with some other package
[09:15] <umista> nice, so how would i place this into a file and make it working
[09:15] <al> hey, Can i download some other codec for playing RMVB files with VLC?

[09:15] <nolimitsoya> al, no. vlc uses its own codecs. you could try mplayer

[09:20] <screechingcat> stephano: change the res in /etc/usplash.conf
[09:20] <christian1222> crimsun: I dont think that worked
[09:20] <Windy> =/
[09:20] <christian1222> crimsun: i tried it, but there is still no sound
[09:20] <VigoFuse> nolimtsoya: If one is working on a Windows OS HD any help is good help, I agree the gpart is great, but the freebies are offering some Data recovery, in case an error is made, and it uses the 516 M$ default sector sizeing.
[09:20] <nivosa> okay have to admit I'm new to linux, and am still trying to digest the vast material involved, but one simple question, what is the term line to install star office 8, I hate admitting I don't know what I'm doing, but.........I don't know what I'm doing and haven't used term years (at one time I ran Mandrake)
[09:20] <Bonez56> hi, i just installed edgy onto my 320gb sata drive, now when I boot it says "Error 22: No such partition" - I have tried lots of things already, can someone help?
[09:20] <screechingcat> guebay: try upgrading in synaptic. it will show you why the packages are held back
[09:20] <crimsun> christian1222: has sound ever been audible?
[09:20] <crimsun> christian1222: (in Ubuntu)
[09:20] <christian1222> no
[09:20] <Windy> i assume you HAVE to do it via terminal for some reason?
[09:21] <crimsun> christian1222: amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 2
[09:21] <christian1222> it used to be
[09:21] <screechingcat> nolimitsoya: not all operations with NTFS
[09:21] <guebay> screechingcat: Okay, I will try. Thanks.
[09:21] <stephano> screechingcat: thanks, i'll try it
[09:21] <al> DId anybody watch the film BeerFest?
[09:21] <al> that was funny
[09:21] <BrokenPipe> So, I'm following the LVM HOWTO, and I'm trying to do a vgextend, but I'm getting the error "No physical volume label read from /dev/sdc1 \n /dev/sdc1 not identified as an existing physical volume \n Unable to add physical volume '/dev/sdc1' to volume group 'vg0'."  Any ideas why?
[09:21] <Windy> nivosa: any reason you can't use add/remove programs or failing that synaptic?
[09:21] <nolimitsoya> guebay, you could try aptitude as well. itll try to resolve the conflict in a more agressive way
[09:21] <nolimitsoya> *g
[09:22] <Windy> oh, that reminds me
[09:22] <christian1222> crimsun: still nothing, the sound worked before, but I had to do something to it I remember, then I reinstalled Linux, and it doesnt work again
[09:22] <screechingcat> nolimitsoya: i dont like aptitude. no supercow powers
[09:22] <Windy> can someone tell me where the partition/HDD management tool's gone in edgy?
[09:23] <Windy> used to be a nice handy option under system --> administration
[09:23] <nivosa> hmmm hadn't even thought of using the interface, just thought you had to install from term.........how would you add it from add/remove, just highlight and click from downloaded location?
[09:23] <nolimitsoya> screechingcat, me neither, but it can be handy with working out dependency problem :)
[09:23] <VigoFuse> Windy: It is called gparted
[09:23] <nolimitsoya> *s
[09:23] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: I'm no expert, but do you need to add an lvm layer to sdc1 first, before adding it to the volume group?
[09:23] <Windy> nivosa: if you open it up, just click the package you want (e.g. star office)
[09:23] <Windy> it should take care of dependencies etc. for you
[09:23] <BrokenPipe> frogzoo: I did a 'pvcreate /dev/sdc1'
[09:23] <crimsun> christian1222: amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 3
[09:23] <Windy> VigoFuse: where's that? sorry, i'm a horribly tuxnub
[09:24] <EdLin> are the bots gone?
[09:24] <xipietotec> anyone know how to set up google search in deskbar-applet?
[09:24] <JoshJ> !google
[09:24] <christian1222> crimsun: nope, dang!
[09:24] <ubotu> Google is a very popular search engine: http://www.google.com  -  Google also has a Linux-specific search engine: http://google.com/linux
[09:24] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: thinks now you need an lvcreate?
[09:24] <JoshJ> bleh
[09:24] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: nope, that's not it
[09:24] <crimsun> christian1222: amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 1
[09:24] <stephano> screechingcat: now, on the shutdown, it's fine, but at the start it's still in the upper-left corner
[09:24] <MarkoKaa> guys, does anyone know something about Ubuntu (apache2) and subdomains?
[09:24] <VigoFuse> Windy: It will appear after the 4 part of the install, it is a GUI tool that resizes and sets the sector for the Ubuntu
[09:25] <christian1222> crimsun: no
[09:25] <BrokenPipe> frogzoo: I already made a Logical Volume.  I made it with sdb1, and now I want to extend to sdc1.  And I get that error.
[09:25] <Windy> VigoFuse: oh no, i dont mean the on install one
[09:25] <screechingcat> stephano: wierd. sorry thats about the extent of my knowledge of usplash
[09:25] <xipietotec> It tells me to go to api.google.com to create an account and get developer's key....but I don't see where to do that on the website
[09:25] <christian1222> crimsun: I dont know what it is, i will just try to get it figured out tomorrow
[09:25] <Windy> in dapper you could go look in admin and there'd be a tool to manage mounts/partitions
[09:25] <xipietotec> and then it says to download an SDK....but it doesn't say which SKD
[09:25] <xipietotec> SDK
[09:25] <christian1222> crimsun: thanks though, i appreciate the help, night
[09:25] <stephano> screechingcat: is the vga=795 right in grub?
[09:25] <crimsun> christian1222: are you using headphones?
[09:25] <Windy> where you could set drives to be not mounted, volume labels, etc.
[09:26] <Windy> that's what i'm looking for
[09:26] <christian1222> crimsun: no
[09:26] <xipietotec> Yeah, why did they get rid of the disks utility?
[09:26] <orestyle5> what is the program used to connect to windows server remotely (terminal something)
[09:26] <orestyle5> via linux
[09:26] <xipietotec> !info samba
[09:26] <ubotu> samba: a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix. In component main, is optional. Version 3.0.22-1ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 2836 kB, installed size 7200 kB
[09:27] <screechingcat> stephano: i dont know. everybody says to put in the vga line, but mine works best without any vga= line
[09:27] <xipietotec> !info lamp
[09:27] <ubotu> Package lamp does not exist in any distro I know
[09:27] <xipietotec> hrmm
[09:27] <Bonez56> hi, i just installed edgy onto my 320gb sata drive, now when I boot it says "Error 22: No such partition" - I have tried lots of things already, can someone help?
[09:27] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: maybe you first need to add sdc1 as a concat volume to the volume group
[09:27] <stephano> screechingcat: anyway, thanks for the help. it is much better now :)
[09:27] <BrokenPipe> frogzoo: That's exactly what vgextend does.
[09:27] <xipietotec> orestyle5: Anyways windows networking is handled by samba and lamp.
[09:28] <christian1222> crimsun: oh well, tomorrow ill be back
[09:28] <Windy> umm...so, anyone?
[09:28] <screechingcat> stephano: cheers mate
[09:28] <orestyle5> xipietotec:  not windows networking.  To manage remote servers over internet.  similar to VNC but a plugin for gnome I think
[09:29] <al> NO... it still not working, isnt there a x64 theolustion for playing RMVB?
[09:29] <shinobi2> anyone got wireless card working on 6.10?
[09:29] <xipietotec> orestyle5: ah, beyond me then
[09:29] <VigoFuse> Windy: I was looking at the official docs for you,,spilled my coffee, lost my train of thought...it happens
[09:29] <orestyle5> Reality, we still have several windows servers, but using Ubuntu to manage them from home.  Connecting to Debian servers in NP
[09:29] <nolimitsoya> al, you could try realplayer. its in multiverse, i think...
[09:29] <Windy> lol
[09:29] <Windy> ah, gotta hate that
[09:30] <VigoFuse> now theres hot coffee in my shoe, and I am gonna fix that
[09:30] <xipietotec> Can anyone help me integrate google search into deskbar-applet?
[09:30] <al> you are not using a x64 system, are you? I gonna crash  :] 
[09:30] <orestyle5> I thought google toolbar was not out for linux yet?
[09:30] <nolimitsoya> al, wikipedia says both mplayer and xine should be able to play rmvb
[09:31] <Windy> hot coffee eh
[09:31] <xipietotec> orestyle5: It's not google-toolbar, its deskbar applet, but there's a way to integrate google-search into it.
[09:31] <orestyle5> or was that google talk?
[09:31] <Windy> i really gotta find that page which tells me how to use mplayer as my default player instead of bloody totem
[09:31] <nolimitsoya> al, 64bit is quite a bit of hazzle, still...
[09:31] <VigoFuse> Windy: what was the qeustion?
[09:31] <al> yes, they play rmvb in i386 very fine, but x64, is that x64?
[09:31] <orestyle5> Hmmm.
[09:31] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: as I understand it, vgextend allocates space for a lv from within an existing vg, but you first need to add sdc1 to the vg - not sure how to do that though
[09:31] <al> ok
[09:31] <xipietotec> google talk also not linux'd, although it's possible to communicate to google-talk members through gaim
[09:31] <al> ok, thanks
[09:32] <Bonez56> hi, i just installed edgy onto my 320gb sata drive, now when I boot it says "Error 22: No such partition" - I have tried lots of things already, can someone help?
[09:32] <xipietotec> Windy: Its easy
[09:32] <Windy> VigoFuse: basically, dapper had an admin utility that'd let you look at mounts/HDDs/partitions that kinda thing
[09:32] <Windy> can't find it in edgy
[09:33] <xipietotec> Click on the file type you want to open in Mplayer, hit prefences, select "Open With ---> Mplayer"
[09:33] <Windy> xipietotec: oh that i know
[09:33] <Windy> but mplayer won't recognise the files
[09:33] <Windy> and i remember i had to get gstreamer plugs
[09:33] <Windy> which i got via the add/remove
[09:33] <Windy> but i feel like i missed a step somewhere
[09:33] <screechingcat> Windy: system>admin>device manager
[09:33] <yuesefa> nolimitsoya:can't install ubuntu on my new 64-bit core 2 duo processor
[09:33] <sean_> Hi all - trying to install nvidia drivers, is this the right place to ask?
[09:33] <orestyle5> xipietotec:  ya, messed with it alittle
[09:33] <yuesefa> is there any  solutions?
[09:33] <VigoFuse> Windy: Did you Multiverse and get the win32codecs?
[09:34] <DARKGuy> sean_: If your distro is ubuntu-based, I guess
[09:34] <orestyle5> xipietotec:  Hey found the program I was looking for.  Its called tsclient (gnome plugin)
[09:34] <sean_> Need help, cant startx API mismatch nvidia kernel module older than X module, after running nvidia installer, thoughts?
[09:34] <DARKGuy> sean_: ouch, I had a similar problem and couldn't solve it and had to reinstall. Sincerely I do't know how to fix it but maybe someone here does?
[09:34] <sean_> kernel - 1.0-7184 , X 1.0-9629
[09:35] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: think the problem maybe is you're giving vgextend the name of the pv, not the lv, the man page example is "vgextend  vg00  /dev/sda4  /dev/sdn1"
[09:35] <CR265> Hi all!
[09:35] <Windy> screechingcat: i think i already looked there
[09:35] <tabman> I'm playing youtube and I can hear the sound, I can hear the sound with Rythmbox Music Player
[09:35] <Windy> VigoFuse: hmm, probably not
[09:35] <tabman> *I can't hear the sound on youtube
[09:35] <Windy> there's a link somewhere on how to do it right? i had to reinstall since last time updating to edgy hosed my system
[09:35] <CR265> Is Ogra around?
[09:35] <Windy> so i forgot how to enable universe repos and the names of the packages
[09:35] <VigoFuse> Windy: as I understand it, that is what needs to be done to play WMA
[09:36] <Windy> yeah
[09:36] <Windy> it shouldn't be needed for stuff like mpegs
[09:36] <JoshJ> !enablingrepositories
[09:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about enablingrepositories - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:36] <BrokenPipe> frogzoo: I don't understand what you're saying. The example is exactly how I did it.
[09:36] <JoshJ> !repositories
[09:36] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[09:36] <JoshJ> there
[09:36] <tabman> ?
[09:36] <sean_> How do I remove the nvidia module from the kernel?
[09:36] <VigoFuse> It kinda messed up, NPR uses WMP,WMA as default, no .oog or whatever support.
[09:37] <JoshJ> !wmp
[09:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wmp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:37] <JoshJ> bleh
[09:37] <JoshJ> !restrictedformats
[09:37] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[09:37] <JoshJ> that has it :[
[09:37] <VigoFuse> !WMA
[09:37] <Windy> eh, confused
[09:37] <JoshJ> just follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories
[09:38] <Windy> screechingcat: yeah, i've looked at device manager, not the same
[09:38] <Windy> heh
[09:38] <Windy> i never remember which text file to edit
[09:38] <VigoFuse> Windy: Windows Codecs are Restricted and Propietary codecs, certain stuff has to be set in order to make them compatible.
[09:38] <Windy> yeah i'm aware of that
[09:39] <Windy> in my case mplayer won't play stuff that totem can play fine
[09:39] <JoshJ> it's /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:39] <JoshJ> and in that case just use totem, silly :P
[09:39] <Windy> sources that's the one
[09:39] <Windy> thanks
[09:39] <Windy> i know how to do it, i just never remember the file
[09:39] <Windy> oh and since when was file paths case sensitive?
[09:40] <we2by> hi
[09:40] <JoshJ> Windy: since 1991, when linux came out?
[09:40] <we2by> does the ubuntu live cd come with gnomebaker?
[09:40] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: when you did pvcreate, did you pass options "format = "lvm2"" ?
[09:40] <Windy> bugger :/
[09:40] <JoshJ> we2by: not sure if it's installed on there by default, but you can install it while running from the live cd
[09:40] <Windy> it was stuffing me over to no end when i was trying to edit xorg.conf
[09:41] <JoshJ> (if it's not)
[09:41] <we2by> JoshJ, but is it on the cd?
[09:41] <al> oh~!!  Sweet!!  Realplayer can play rmvb file in x64 !  thanks buddy!
[09:41] <JoshJ> we2by: i don't know :P
[09:41] <frogzoo> BrokenPipe: btw, the manpages say the procedure is pvcreate, the vgextend, so you're on the right track
[09:41] <Windy> bah, odd linux conventions, i assume there's reason for it
[09:41] <tabman> I have no sound on youtube ?
[09:41] <JoshJ> Windy: casesensitivity is a good thing
[09:41] <tanlaan> how do you uninstall ubuntu? I installed it onto the wrong partition/drive. I want to get rid of ubuntu AND grub.
[09:41] <VigoFuse> Realplayer works in Ubuntu6.10 Edgy?
[09:41] <compengi_> we2by, gnomebaker isn't installed on default
[09:41] <Windy> improved security in case hackers jeopardise the lower case or some such
[09:41] <tanlaan> how do you uninstall ubuntu? I installed it onto the wrong partition/drive. I want to get rid of ubuntu AND grub.
[09:41] <orestyle5> !time
[09:41] <ubotu> time: The GNU time program for measuring cpu resource usage. In component main, is standard. Version 1.7-21 (edgy), package size 31 kB, installed size 144 kB
[09:41] <we2by> shit
[09:42] <Windy> JoshJ: in a password, maybe
[09:42] <we2by> I need a burn software :(
[09:42] <RawSewage> What MMORPGs work on Ubuntu
[09:42] <Windy> in a file path? senseless imo
[09:42] <frogzoo> Windy: file paths in nix have been case sensitive from year dot
[09:42] <JoshJ> yeah...
[09:42] <tanlaan> sorry for the double post
[09:42] <JoshJ> it's not just linux, it's unix period
[09:42] <Windy> RawSewage: not Lineage II, i know that
[09:42] <JoshJ> probably in POSIX specs somewhere
[09:42] <compengi_> we2by, install k3b
[09:42] <frogzoo> RawSewage: WoW works, best if you have nvidia though
[09:42] <Windy> JoshJ: oh well
[09:42] <JoshJ> RawSewage: WoW works under wine/cedega
[09:42] <we2by> compengi_, no internet connection
[09:42] <RawSewage> frogzoo, I do
[09:42] <Windy> i'm not really fully aware of the reasons/specs
[09:42] <compengi_> oh
[09:42] <DARKGuy> RawSewage: WoW works in Ubuntu
[09:42] <RawSewage> I need Cedega?
[09:42] <JoshJ> or wine
[09:43] <DARKGuy> Cedega and Wine do
[09:43] <RawSewage> JoshJ, plain Wine?
[09:43] <JoshJ> sure
[09:43] <FirstStrike> A lot of people running cedega have been getting banned by blizzard for 'running cheats' when in reality they were simply running cedega and it triggered their anti-cheats or whatever.
[09:43] <defrysk> !upgrade > defrysk
[09:43] <FirstStrike> So, be wary.
[09:43] <JoshJ> yeah, cedega, not wine- worth noting
[09:43] <RawSewage> ty
[09:43] <tanlaan> Can anyone help me with the uninstall of ubuntu?
[09:43] <compengi_> we2by, but by default linux has a burning cd which if you insert a blank cd it will pop up and will allow you to create data cd
[09:43] <JoshJ> !uninstall
[09:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uninstall - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:43] <DARKGuy> The Warden just doesn't get the process list in Cedega and it uses API not allowed by it so...
[09:43] <JoshJ> bleh
[09:43] <orestyle5> finally got joe installed
[09:44] <DARKGuy> it's just a plain stupid excuse for Blizzard, since people is using hacks anyways
[09:44] <RawSewage> Can I make money playing WoW, or is that too sweatshopped
[09:44] <frogzoo> RawSewage: you'll need the up to date wine deb, not the standard ubuntu repo one
[09:44] <we2by> ok, cool
[09:44] <RawSewage> frogzoo, ok
[09:44] <frogzoo> !wine | RawSewage
[09:44] <ubotu> RawSewage: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[09:44] <JoshJ> RawSewage: you can make money playing wow if you want to spend 16 hours a day borging
[09:44] <DARKGuy> RawSewage: JoshJ's right, besides it's not very encouraged
[09:44] <compengi_> we2by, but if you are willing to copy  a cd you can right click on the source cd a click then on copy then give a destination disk
[09:44] <FirstStrike> DARKGuy: There's a long, long thread of people banned complaining on the cedega and WoW forums
[09:44] <compengi_> and*
[09:44] <DARKGuy> FirstStrike: Yeah, I read it u.u
[09:44] <tabman> damn, this channel is overloaded now, I've come here after a month, Ubuntu needs to find other sources for quick help too many people using it resulting it too many people coming for help
[09:45] <VigoFuse> I made some sweet coins playing EQ.
[09:45] <JoshJ> it hasn't really gotten that much bigger in the past month
[09:45] <tabman> and no one replying to my query
[09:45] <DARKGuy> tabman: and too many learning which means lots of help
[09:45] <DARKGuy> tabman: Well, maybe nobody at this hour knows
[09:45] <JoshJ> tabman: repeat it then
[09:45] <tabman> I did twice man :)
[09:45] <JoshJ> oh
[09:45] <JoshJ> !flash sound
[09:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about flash sound - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:45] <JoshJ> there's a wiki page for it
[09:45] <JoshJ> !sound
[09:45] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

[09:46] <orestyle5> imagine if 3 percent of the world using linux for desktop....
[09:46] <VigoFuse> Did the jury come back on EasyUbuntu? or is that still out?
[09:46] <JoshJ> orestyle5: i think it's more than that worldwide
[09:46] <frogzoo> orestyle5: what's the actual %?
[09:46] <britt> are there any alternatives for a login program
[09:46] <orestyle5> actually I think its less
[09:46] <JoshJ> VigoFuse: as far as i know it's basically "not as bad as automatix but it's not recommended"
[09:46] <britt> maybe one that can auto-login
[09:47] <JoshJ> !autologin
[09:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about autologin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:47] <VigoFuse> JoshJ: Thank you
[09:47] <JoshJ> >:[
[09:47] <britt> JoshJ, nice.
[09:47] <britt> ;)
[09:47] <britt> uh, i know of a autologin script
[09:47] <JoshJ> xipietotec: skins?
[09:47] <xipietotec> gaim is not skinnable
[09:47] <orestyle5> frogzoo:  read an article, I thinks its 1%
[09:47] <JoshJ> ah hrm
[09:48] <JoshJ> orestyle5: it's definitely more than 1%
[09:48] <britt> but everytime i turn off the terminal, getty does not respawn
[09:48] <FirstStrike> oh, if anyone uses amsn..0.96 just came out a couple days ago. it's workin good so far.
[09:48] <JoshJ> i'd guess maybe 5-10 percent worldwide
[09:48] <al> thanks for helping~  bye bye
[09:48] <orestyle5> JoshJ:  for servers yes, but desktops?
[09:48] <JoshJ> keep in mind europe has a higher linux adoption rate than america
[09:48] <nikin> i hate update managger
[09:48] <JoshJ> i believe germany and france are pushing 30% linux?
[09:48] <JoshJ> something like that
[09:48] <orestyle5> JoshJ:  I need to find that linux article
[09:48] <orestyle5> linux article
[09:48] <Microsoft_Spy> When people get of hold of Vista they will probly be changing quicker too
[09:48] <orestyle5> Ya, wait till vista comes out
[09:49] <JoshJ> OMG it's a microsoft spy quick everyone hide!
[09:49] <JoshJ> >_>
[09:49] <Microsoft_Spy> Vista is craaaapy
[09:49] <JoshJ> heh yeah
[09:49] <lola> hey.. I installed ubuntu on the third partition of my macbook yesterday, with lilo as a bootloadder, and everything worked fine until my approx~ twentieth reboot responded with ten printed rows of 9A 9A 9A 9A....
[09:49] <JoshJ> did you see the article about the shutdown menu?
[09:49] <lola> any tips?
[09:49] <JoshJ> lola: you sure it wasn't the 30th?
[09:49] <nikin> why can't that program correctly calculate the time what is left over? it is wrong for about 1200%, if not more
[09:49] <JoshJ> every 30 reboots ubuntu wants to check the filesystem
[09:49] <lola> ;P
[09:49] <orestyle5> My InformationWeek had some article on Vista
[09:49] <lola> I'm thinking that it might have to do with an update of my kernel
[09:50] <JoshJ> i find it hilarious that it took them over a year to get that silly shutdown menu
[09:50] <Microsoft_Spy> I like how ubuntu server doesn't do graphical gui by default
[09:50] <JoshJ> i thought most (non-NT) servers did no-graphics by default?
[09:50] <orestyle5> why would you want a gui on a server?
[09:50] <Microsoft_Spy> Dunno mate.....reading between the lines Mark Shuttleworth wants to replace Debian eventually
[09:50] <JoshJ> to do a better job of BOFHing
[09:50] <VigoFuse> To play games!
[09:51] <JoshJ> actually shuttleworth's basically said ubuntu can't exist without debian
[09:51] <orestyle5> Sweet games on the dual processor server....  Those where the days
[09:51] <lola> JoshJ but do you think that it might effect lilo?
[09:51] <JoshJ> i assume you'd be "better off" with ubuntu servers if you used ubuntu desktops
[09:51] <JoshJ> oh, don't use lilo, i have no clue :(
[09:51] <Microsoft_Spy> Josh...Sorry wrong window., but yeah can't exist at the moment, but when he gets some more financial backing that might be a different story
[09:52] <lola> macbooks are sucky computers to get working with linux
[09:52] <lola> :(
[09:52] <Microsoft_Spy> JoshJ.....Samba works good
[09:52] <JoshJ> i'm starting to think some major linux distro should basically make the equivalent of mac stores near college campuses
[09:52] <frogzoo> Microsoft_Spy: can't be done - Linux only works because of the community
[09:52] <JoshJ> i know if a store selling computers built *for* linux opened up near GT it'd do well
[09:52] <matthew_> lol, it took them 20 something people to "Design" the shutdown menu and get the code written...puh-freakin'-leaze
[09:53] <matthew_> good night, all
[09:53] <Microsoft_Spy> frogzoo....The community will still exist, I suspect if Debian keeps loosing it's user base they will need somewhere to go
[09:53] <orestyle5> I think most linux distros should find a standard way to do packages
[09:53] <we2by> lola, I got a macboook working with ubuntu edgy
[09:53] <VigoFuse> Ubuntu is being sold all over Amazon, 4.95-6.95 a pop, Winders came down, $79.00 now,,,xp Home
[09:53] <JoshJ> orestyle5: there basically are- apt and rpm
[09:53] <frogzoo> Microsoft_Spy: there's several other distros hanging off debian's coattails too
[09:53] <orestyle5> yast?
[09:54] <orestyle5> What is mandrava using?
[09:54] <JoshJ> yast is a full blown sysadmin tool isn't it?
[09:54] <JoshJ> mandriva uses rpm/yum
[09:54] <lola> we2by, nice! I installed edgy too..
[09:54] <britt> in edgy, what is used instead of cron?
[09:54] <JoshJ> suse uses rpm, i think yast is just a different frontend
[09:54] <orestyle5> Just came to mind, not really sure
[09:54] <JoshJ> !cron
[09:54] <ubotu> cron is a way to schedule execution of software/scripts. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto  -  There is also a decent Howto at http://www.tech-geeks.org/contrib/mdrone/cron&crontab-howto.htm
[09:54] <orestyle5> Ah
[09:54] <JoshJ> !anacron
[09:54] <ubotu> anacron: a cron-like program that doesn't go by time. In component main, is optional. Version 2.3-11ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 30 kB, installed size 232 kB
[09:54] <lola> we2by did you experience bootloader problems?
[09:54] <britt> i need to run something every second
[09:54] <JoshJ> hrm
[09:54] <JoshJ> not it i guess
[09:54] <JoshJ> !vickycron
[09:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vickycron - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:54] <xipietotec> I hope the gaim people decide to copy gtalk's GUI
[09:54] <frogzoo> britt: there's cron & anacron
[09:54] <we2by> lola, I got kernel panic form time to time, but it is a kown issue
[09:54] <xipietotec> it's so much better...
[09:54] <Microsoft_Spy> frog: Mark Shuttleworth said in an interview on youtube that he wants Ubuntu to be what other people develop off....Reading into it, I was thinking he eventually wants to be where Debian is now
[09:54] <we2by> lola, be sure to run lilo -p
[09:55] <britt> frogzoo, whatever will let me run a command every second
[09:55] <lola> we2by ok
[09:55] <we2by> lola, there is a guide on macbook+ubuntu
[09:55] <britt> i assume cron?
[09:55] <we2by> google it
[09:55] <orestyle5> Who is Mark Shuttleworth?  :)
[09:55] <JoshJ> !shuttleworth
[09:55] <frogzoo> Microsoft_Spy: yeh, well sometimes you don't get what you wish for
[09:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about shuttleworth - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:55] <nolimitsoya> bdfl
[09:55] <JoshJ> THAT should be fixed!

[09:55] <we2by> bbl
[09:55] <VigoFuse> LOL
[09:55] <nolimitsoya> sabdfl, to be precice :P
[09:55] <JoshJ> shuttleworth is basically the "benevolent dictator for life" of ubuntu
[09:55] <xipietotec> orestyle5: Mark Shuttleworth is a friend of Steve Ballmer....
[09:55] <frogzoo> !bdfl | orestyle5
[09:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bdfl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:55] <lola> we2by.. ok, yeah Ive followed it a bit but I got a bit scared when I woke up this morning and got such a weird problem :)
[09:55] <compengi_> how can i check what flash version i have for firefox?
[09:55] <Microsoft_Spy> frog...I agree....Sometimes if u have $ you have more of a chance of getting what you want too
[09:56] <crimsun> compengi_: about:plugins

[09:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sapbdfl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:56] <nolimitsoya> >_<
[09:56] <lola> we2by I spent all day yesterday fixing beryl and stuff :)
[09:56] <nolimitsoya> ubotu needs educating...
[09:56] <orestyle5> Ah, well, we got Linus here in my neck of the woods (Beaverton)
[09:56] <Microsoft_Spy> Sorta the Bill Gates of the Linux world
[09:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about needs educating... - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:56] <JoshJ> ..heh
[09:56] <Microsoft_Spy> or would that be Linus Torvald....I dunno
[09:56] <nikin> compengi_ : rightclick on it
[09:57] <JoshJ> i don't think there is a "bill gates (or steve ballmer) of the linux world"
[09:57] <compengi_> nikin, right click on whaT?
[09:57] <orestyle5> Yep, Linus Torvald
[09:57] <frogzoo> Microsoft_Spy: I'd always assumed Canonical's aim was to turn a profit by offering the commercial support
[09:57] <nothlit> Lol ^
[09:57] <JoshJ> ...heh
[09:57] <nikin> Compengi: on a flash banner
[09:57] <JoshJ> actually ubuntu's purpose is to solve bug #1
[09:57] <JoshJ> https://launchpad.net/bug1.html
[09:57] <britt> i see crontab
[09:57] <nikin> compengi_ and there will be some kind of an About menu
[09:57] <britt> and i see the minute column
[09:57] <nothlit> linus is just as much a figure as bill gates or steve ballmer
[09:58] <britt> can i run something 1/60th of a minute
[09:58] <nolimitsoya> bug #1 is an irritating bug for sure...
[09:58] <compengi_> i didn't get where should i click =/
[09:58] <orestyle5> basically the father of linux
[09:58] <nolimitsoya> im hoping itll be patched soon :P
[09:58] <nothlit> britt, why?
[09:58] <frogzoo> JoshJ: bug #1 is an ubuntu bug -> you have deadlock
[09:58] <compengi_> and where to go
=== compengi_ is now known as compengi
[09:58] <nikin> what is bug #1?
[09:58] <britt> nothlit, bc i cant get getty to respawn
[09:58] <britt> so when i turn off my serial terminal
[09:58] <JoshJ> nikin : https://launchpad.net/bug1.html
[09:58] <britt> getty dumps out
[09:58] <nolimitsoya> nikin, that we havnt reached world dominion yet :P
[09:59] <britt> i need to issue 'sudo start ttyS1' every 2 seconds or so
[09:59] <compengi> crimsun, where is about:plugin found?
[09:59] <nikin> JohsJ: i ame still in Terminal, but ty
[09:59] <JoshJ> uh that seems like a horrible workaround britt :(
[09:59] <JoshJ> nikin: use lynx?
[09:59] <Microsoft_Spy> frogzoo: Yeah I assumed that too....It's funny how success changes things though
[09:59] <JoshJ> or links?
[09:59] <britt> JoshJ, you have any other suggestion
[09:59] <JoshJ> britt : wait til you find a real solution? :(
[10:00] <britt> JoshJ, sigh
[10:00] <Microsoft_Spy> frogzoo: However I doubt he will ever weild as much control as Bill Gates, due to the whole community thing
[10:00] <JoshJ> i dunno, that whole "run a command every second via crontab" solution seems like it belongs on thedailywtf.com
[10:00] <nikin> JoshJ, yeye... you are right, but i ame darn tired .... its 10AM dude, and i didnt sleep, but i will look after it
[10:00] <JoshJ> Microsoft_Spy: i'd say that's a good thing
[10:00] <orestyle5> I love that site
[10:00] <Microsoft_Spy> I remember reading about a few comments bill made off the record about Linux being pretty good
[10:00] <frogzoo> Microsoft_Spy: remember because of the licencing, anyone can always just repackage ubuntu & if they do it better, that's where the user base will go
[10:00] <britt> i wonder if i could get the autologin script to pass the 'start ttyS1' at the end
[10:00] <nolimitsoya> Microsoft_Spy, well, he is the dictator for life... thing is, with linux there is always alternatives :) thats what will keep the hybris back
[10:00] <Microsoft_Spy> Josh...Ohh yeah, very good thing
[10:00] <JoshJ> giving too much power to one person is a bad thing
[10:01] <britt> anybody know how to pass a command using C
[10:01] <britt> i forgot
[10:01] <frogzoo> nolimitsoya: MS is the "self appointed" dictator for life - it's an important distinction
[10:01] <crimsun> compengi: the location bar
[10:01] <orestyle5> Ya, but nothing lasts forever!
[10:01] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, i was talking about shuttleworth...
[10:02] <nikin> britt: what does this "start ttyS1" do?
[10:02] <Microsoft_Spy> We need more standards through linux distributions though.....particularly in package management.
[10:02] <orestyle5> That what I was saying
[10:02] <JoshJ> i kinda think it's okay to have deb and rpm
[10:02] <frogzoo> nolimitsoya: curiously Mark Shuttleworth = MS
[10:02] <JoshJ> there's not much beyond that
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> Microsoft_Spy, na, what we need is free, fair and open competition. thats what we got right now.
[10:02] <Microsoft_Spy> Hmmm yeah I like Puppy Linux too.....I designed a robot on it for my masters
[10:02] <JoshJ> no, we have pretend competition
[10:02] <orestyle5> Go to get a piece of software, theres the to five different packages
[10:02] <JoshJ> where microsoft pretends to let the others compete
[10:02] <nikin> JoshJ: my printer doesnt work coz we have deb and rpm... arghhhh
[10:03] <VigoFuse> 99% of us grew up on MS , and are still useing it, fact is the geek did good, now he married a babe, so he left the company, as geekes will do,
[10:03] <compengi> crimsun, you mean in firefox?
[10:03] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, right... did catch it right the first time :)
[10:03] <orestyle5> I started out with Apple, but the screen was green
[10:03] <britt> nikin, starts a terminal to a serial port, so my terminal can access it
[10:03] <Microsoft_Spy> nolimit: Yeah I guess, that can be a pain in the but too...I guess it all depends what you want to achieve
[10:03] <britt> i have a serial terminal
[10:03] <nolimitsoya> JoshJ, i was referring to standardisation of package management
[10:03] <VigoFuse> Zenith 840, LOVED that Green Text
[10:03] <nikin> britt: and why do you need a new terminal ain every second?
[10:04] <we2by> omg, lol
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> Microsoft_Spy, its more a question of short term vs long term. open copmetition is the only good long term solution
[10:04] <we2by> op
[10:04] <britt> nikin, with my autologin script im running
[10:04] <JoshJ> i don't see why package management really needs to be standardized... nothing wrong with having apt-get as opposed to synaptic or yum or yast
[10:04] <orestyle5> Maybe the green screen will make a come back?
[10:04] <britt> it dumps getty out when i turn the terminal off
[10:04] <Microsoft_Spy> Vigo...Yeah he did do a good job, but u gotta admit the only thing making people use M$ is the whole familiarity/compatibility thing
[10:04] <Microsoft_Spy> nolimits....Yeah theres probly some truth in that too...
[10:04] <orestyle5> except with microsoft there is standarization with the exe.  so it is less confusing to new commers
[10:04] <frogzoo> JoshJ: it was segmentation that killed unix - it would be really good if all distros consolidated on one format, be it it deb or rpm
[10:05] <VigoFuse> My TandyTRS-83 still has a working Green Screen, its teeny tine kewl :-)
[10:05] <Microsoft_Spy> frog...My point exactly
[10:05] <britt> VigoFuse, i love my WYSE terminal
[10:05] <nolimitsoya> orestyle5, id like to refute that. the existance of sites lika ntcompatible is proff of the contrary ;)
[10:05] <britt> just wish it would work correctly
[10:05] <nolimitsoya> *e
[10:05] <Microsoft_Spy> Vigo...I got a commodore 64 and a Microbee
[10:05] <JoshJ> disagree, frogzoo - taking away options for the sake of everything being the same is bad
[10:05] <Microsoft_Spy> CPM rocks...
[10:05] <JoshJ> make it easy to convert rpm to deb, and vice versa, and there you go
[10:05] <VigoFuse> FORTRAN is the one true leader of the realm
[10:05] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, rpm would be the end of it >_<
[10:06] <JoshJ> work on making the formats more compatible and work on alien
[10:06] <orestyle5> nolimitsoya:  never been to the site, but when I go to get software, there is one microsoft and 4 linux.
[10:06] <Microsoft_Spy> Josh...You can still have options and a standard...it's the vendors choice to follow the standard
[10:06] <VigoFuse> Comm64s are awesome. I still play HG2G on mine.
[10:07] <orestyle5> Where is Mandriva in all this. I heard they are off in left field with some package management.  Everyone wants to reinvent the wheel instead of using a package manager that work...
[10:07] <Microsoft_Spy> I bought one of those C64 joysticks....havn't had time to mod it yet
[10:07] <orestyle5> Or at least agree on one package manager that sort of works...
[10:07] <orestyle5> :)
[10:07] <we2by> something wrong with the current package management??
[10:07] <orestyle5> which one....
[10:08] <Microsoft_Spy> I don't have an indepth knowledge of what package management is better for what reason....But I have a soft spot for .deb
[10:08] <we2by> deb
[10:08] <JoshJ> orestyle5: gentoo is the one that's "in left field"
[10:08] <orestyle5> not that I am aware of...
[10:08] <nolimitsoya> could anyone help me sort this out: is it possible to painlessly expand (add drives to) an lvm raid level 5, without lifting and reinserting all data, while remaining online?
[10:08] <nolimitsoya> Microsoft_Spy, apt/portage > *
[10:08] <we2by> does Ubuntu support raid out of the box?
[10:08] <orestyle5> attach external scsi device?
[10:09] <nolimitsoya> we2by, yes
[10:09] <frogzoo> nolimitsoya: no, not possible - backup & restore
[10:09] <orestyle5> nolimitsoya:  maybe attach external scsi device?
[10:09] <nolimitsoya> frogzoo, ok, thats what i thought... linux needs zfs, bad!
[10:09] <nolimitsoya> orestyle5, that would help how exactly?
[10:10] <gaviin> Hello! How do I install .rpm packages? And... what are they?
[10:10] <VigoFuse> !.rpm
[10:10] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[10:10] <orestyle5> not sure. could you mount the external scsi device then format with whatever then do something with RAID?
[10:10] <nolimitsoya> gaviin, first of all, you should avoid them at all cost. second, use alien. man alien for instructions
[10:10] <orestyle5> ya, but you can use apt on other systems too
[10:10] <Firefishe> Can having more than one version of automake installed do weird things to a build?
[10:11] <gaviin> Hmmm. I didn't realize it was redhat.
[10:11] <nolimitsoya> orestyle5, im not talking about just hotswapping, but enlarging arrays...
[10:11] <frogzoo> gaviin: your best option is an ubuntu deb, then compile from source - rpms only as a last resort (via alien)
[10:12] <orestyle5> Not sure.  Well, we have an external RAID Array attached to scsi backplane.  I wonder if you could attach then make part of array with something like that.  I think I dont know... :)
[10:13] <gaviin> frogzoo: what is the difference between a deb, and the source?
[10:13] <frogzoo> gaviin: the deb is a packaged binary, the source you have to compile & install yourself & the package manager knows nothing about it
[10:14] <nothlit> nolimitsoya, wouldn't building your own package with checkinstall be preferable to using alien?
[10:15] <gaviin> damn. Then I guess there's no deb for this. OK thanks!
[10:15] <Microsoft_Spy> Yeah I've not had alot of luck with alien
[10:17] <JoshJ> i think i had to use alien for one thing on dapper and it worked fine
[10:17] <JoshJ> can't even remember what it was
[10:17] <gaviin> when you compile something from source, does it arrange the binaries in the same way downlodaing from apt-get would?
[10:17] <surface> any software can capture from my webcam and make a video?
[10:17] <gaviin> like, do I have to move anything after I compile?
[10:17] <JoshJ> i know that basically "if it's not in the ubuntu repositories it's not really recommended" is the general modus operandi, but i know how to fix things :p
[10:17] <surface> gavlin depends
[10:17] <JoshJ> gaviin: it probably doesn't compile into /usr/bin, nor put stuff in the menus, etc; unless that's part of the compiling script
[10:18] <surface> gaviin, when u configure, u can set it with prefix
[10:18] <surface> gaviin, ./configure --prefix=/usr
[10:18] <borg> what's the command that lists all the processes?
[10:18] <Toma-> little not on compiling: use checkinstall instead of make install
[10:18] <JoshJ> uh, why?
[10:18] <gaviin> borg: top
[10:18] <surface> can check out this, http://lne.blogdns.com/lbe/archives/156/installing-from-tarballs/
[10:19] <JoshJ> if the install.txt file says "do ./configure, make, then make install as root" you really should do that
[10:19] <Burnser> hi all
[10:19] <Toma-> borg: 'ps aux'
[10:19] <Microsoft_Spy> Anyone running feisty fawn at the moment ?
[10:19] <orestyle5__> I agree ...
[10:19] <Toma-> JoshJ: checkinstall will keep your system tidy
[10:19] <surface> any software can capture from my webcam and make a video?
[10:19] <nothlit> gaviin, They aren't optimised for debian (based) systems, but don't compile them manually, use checkinstall so you can cleanly manage/remove them
[10:19] <Toma-> surface: xawtv
[10:20] <surface> Toma-, oh thx i ll try
[10:20] <borg> omg, "top" is the greatest command ever
[10:20] <JoshJ> gah i can't start anything new right now >_<
[10:20] <JoshJ> i just managd to lock my system somehow
[10:20] <JoshJ> urg
[10:20] <highneko> Scrolling on gnome-panel switches active windows. How can I disable this?
[10:21] <gaviin> surface: There's no install instructions, what happens if I set that parameter to /usr?
[10:21] <JoshJ> yeah i'm going to end up shutting down from terminal
[10:21] <JoshJ> whee :(
[10:21] <surface> gaviin, it will install in /usr/bin
[10:21] <surface> /usr/lib
[10:21] <surface> if u set /usr/local
[10:22] <gaviin> oh, ok good. is there any time when that would be a bad idea?
[10:22] <surface> then /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib instead
[10:22] <surface> gaviin, i always check my previous install from apt-get
[10:22] <surface> if it is at /usr then i ll check with configure
=== danieloster91 is now known as danieloster91|AF
[10:23] <surface> ./configure --help
[10:23] <surface> usually it do tell u the default prefix
[10:23] <gaviin> ok
[10:23] <gaviin> i can live with that
[10:23] <gaviin> thanks a lot, ill try it out now
[10:25] <Zehrila> Hello everybody!
[10:26] <Zehrila> Is it possible to download a few packages (let's say, kubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop), burn them to disc and then install them using a CLI-only installation of Ubuntu?
[10:26] <maxsoft> ?
[10:26] <maxsoft> so.. do you like create a new distro? :)
[10:26] <surface> gaviin, welcome
[10:27] <Zehrila> No, not a new distro.
[10:27] <Huibert> Zehrila: I think you should look into apt on cd
[10:27] <jimboedgynoob> Hey Zehrila good question I like it, I have wondered that - on other words a NETWORKLESS install of Ubuntu with extras?
[10:27] <Zehrila> The same distro; just need to install it on an offline system.
[10:27] <Zehrila> jimboedgynoob: Precisely!
[10:27] <Terminus> Zehrila: should be possible if you take care of the dependencies.
[10:27] <Huibert> Zehrila: here: http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/
[10:28] <Huibert> Zehrila: but AFAIK it's beta
[10:28] <Zehrila> Huibert: Alright, thanks a bunch. Lemme look into it. =] 
[10:28] <Zehrila> The dependencies could be a pain though, heh.
[10:28] <Terminus> well, i'd just download the packages(including dependencies), put them in /var/cache/apt/archives/, and run aptitude.
[10:29] <Huibert> Zehrila: not if you create the cd for / on similar systems
[10:29] <gaviin> surface: at the end of the config it says i need the X libraries and headers. is that X-dev?
[10:29] <Zehrila> I see.
[10:29] <surface> gaviin, u r compiling fluxbox?
[10:30] <gaviin> no, fbdesk
[10:30] <Zehrila> Terminus: So if I download the packages including dependencies using one system, copy them into /var/cache/apt/archives on the system on which I'm installing and run aptitude, it'd work fine?
[10:30] <surface> gaviin, this is the example of me recompile fluxbox
[10:30] <surface> http://my.opera.com/mysurface/blog/2006/12/02/i-recompile-my-fluxbox-from-source
[10:30] <surface> gaviin, u need this xlibs-dev
[10:31] <jimboedgynoob> Does ubuntu come as a dvd install? could google it but that might be the answer to a networkless install?
[10:31] <surface> apt-get install xlibs-dev
[10:31] <Huibert> Zehrila: I don't know if that is sufficient, but I would guess so
[10:31] <surface> gaviin, u fluxbox user?
[10:31] <Huibert> jimboedgynoob: yes, 6.10 is available as dvd
[10:31] <Huibert> !edgy
[10:31] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. Upgrading to Edgy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - Downloading: http://www.ubuntu.com/download - Release Notes: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[10:31] <Zehrila> jimboedgynoob: I guess it does; I recall seeing it somewhere, though I might be wrong.
[10:31] <jimboedgynoob> ok thanks huibert
[10:32] <gaviin> surface: Yeah, fluxbuntu.
[10:32] <gaviin> surface: Reading.
[10:32] <Terminus> Zehrila: theoretically, yes. oh, but you'll have to update the package list first. i dunno how to do that on a box with no net connection.
[10:33] <Huibert> Terminus: yep, the packagelist most be updated..... there should be an apt-* command to do this
[10:33] <Zehrila> Ah yes, that I didn't think of.

[10:35] <Huibert> jimboedgynoob: look here, it's a german wiki but shows some links: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Downloads
[10:36] <pubuntu> hi. how to add footnote in the end of section (not page or document) in openoffice?
[10:37] <jimboedgynoob> thanks huibert bookmarked it for later translation
[10:37] <Zehrila> It seems APTonCD would only work for packages downloaded using APT-GET or APTITUDE. I'm looking for a way to download them using Windows.
[10:38] <jimboedgynoob> Zehrila the "dependency hell" cannot be solved downloading with Windows as far as I know
[10:38] <Zehrila> And then install them offline on ubuntu, by burning them on CD or simply accessing them from the hard drive.
[10:38] <Huibert> Zehrila: apt on cd is a tool to "freeze" your current system
[10:38] <Zehrila> Yups, it seems so.
[10:38] <Zehrila> Freeze and then rejuvenate using that frozen state...
[10:39] <Huibert> Zehrila: if the other pc has no internet, you could also install a "shadow copy" on the windows/internet machine
[10:40] <RobNyc> is there any way to read my osx partition
[10:40] <Huibert> Zehrila: then you could use apt on cd on the shadow to upgrade the main pc
[10:40] <Zehrila> A shadow copy?
[10:40] <Huibert> Zehrila: install a ubuntu in vmware player or something
[10:40] <jimboedgynoob> Sorta like Norton Ghost Huibert?
[10:40] <Zehrila> Oh that.
[10:41] <Huibert> jimboedgynoob: nope, NG does sector like copies of partitions (AFAIK)
[10:41] <Zehrila> Yups, that makes perfect sense.
[10:41] <jimboedgynoob> OK huibert
[10:42] <Huibert> jimboedgynoob: which makes sense in wondows world, because you cannot ressurect you sstem installation with software of the net.
[10:42] <Zehrila> Install ubuntu in vmware, download all the stuff I need, use APTonCD to get the snapshot and burn it on disc, then install a fresh copy and use APTonCD to get it to the condition it was in wmware...
[10:42] <Terminus> Zehrila: if the windows computer is anywhere near your ubuntu computer, it might be easier to network the two than figure out how to update offline. =)
[10:42] <Huibert> Zehrila: and rince, lather, repeat
[10:42] <Zehrila> Heh.
[10:43] <jimboedgynoob> Yes I used to use Norton Ghost quite a bit in the Windows 98 days - quite handy 8-)
[10:43] <Zehrila> Terminus: There's only one computer.
[10:43] <Huibert> Zehrila: the one computer is connected to the net?
[10:43] <Zehrila> I can only set ubuntu up in commandline mode; other installation methods somehow crash.
[10:43] <Terminus> Zehrila: oh, no ubuntu drivers for your net connection hardware?
[10:43] <simon92> hello
[10:43] <Zehrila> Well, lemme explain the whole scenario. It is one machine and the only internet connection I have is dial-up.
[10:43] <Huibert> simon92: hello...
[10:43] <sujan> hi, i have installed ubuntu from syanptic, but then when i try to run php from cli, it shows errors, how do i rectify that?
[10:44] <sujan> ufff, installed php using synaptic
=== reus is now known as megaR0m
[10:44] <Huibert> Zehrila: dailup :-((
[10:44] <Zehrila> Now the only error-free installation I can manage from the ubuntu-alternate disc is a CLI-only one.
[10:44] <simon92> Why do I get banned when I want to join #ubuntu-de?

[10:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about english - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:45] <IamUnique> If i download ubuntu and burn it to a cd, does it have the live cd so i can see what's it like before i decide to install it or not?
[10:45] <jimboedgynoob> haha Huibert I'm running on diallup right now - major updates on the system I ket them keep running overnight
[10:45] <Zehrila> IamUnique: Yes, it does.
[10:45] <Huibert> there is an ubotu thingy somewhere
[10:45] <Hirvinen> simon92: Try #ubuntu-de for German.

[10:48] <Zehrila> And even then, it gives a lot of errors and warnings while installing ubuntu-desktop but I finally manage getting the GUi, which again isn't quite bug-free. That's the reason I just wiped the ubuntu partitions and decided to start over again, after getting info about offline package installation from here.
[10:48] <Huibert> Zehrila: get a 5$ nic card of ebay, saves a lot off hassle
[10:48] <simon92> huibert that was the first time i had connected ^^
[10:49] <boink> and get a rtl card, they work fine on linux :)
[10:49] <Zehrila> NIC card?
[10:49] <Huibert> simon92: maybe somebody else used the same nick before?
[10:49] <boink> ethernet card
[10:49] <Zehrila> Oh, that.
[10:49] <simon92> huibert that could be
[10:49] <Zehrila> I've got one already. The problem is, there's no LAN here.
[10:49] <simon92> I try another
[10:50] <boink> ok, use someone's open wireless connection
[10:50] <Zehrila> The machine is a laptop with ethernet built-in but the only internet connection method I have here is dialup.
[10:50] <IamUnique> Placing the files which typically would be stored on a hard drive, onto a ram disk. This however does cut down on the RAM available to applications, reducing performance somewhat.
[10:50] <boink> ok, use the dialup
[10:50] <Zehrila> Got wi-fi built-in too, but no hotspots around. I'm in a developing country, heh.
[10:50] <IamUnique> I got 512MB of ram would it work with my system?
[10:50] <Huibert> Zehrila: are you sure you want to continue using this dailup thing ??
[10:50] <boink> ubuntu works fine with dial-up
[10:50] <Zehrila> Huibert: At the moment, being broke, I don't seem to have much of a choice.
[10:51] <simon1992> it seems to depend on me -.-

[10:51] <Huibert> Guten Morgen
[10:52] <Zehrila> While I had the GUI, there was an issue. I couldn't connect using my dialup modem. It gave me the tone when I tried it using the bundled telephony application but I couldn't find anything to connect to my ISP using my modem.
[10:52] <RoC_MM_0w> who said tremulous?

[10:52] <ubotu> Huibert: Deutschsprachige Hilfe fuer Probleme mit Ubuntu, Kubuntu und Edubuntu finden Sie in den Kanaelen #ubuntu-de, #kubuntu-de, #xubuntu-de und #edubuntu-de
[10:52] <IamUnique> Would my system run ubuntu live cd since i got 512MB RAM?
[10:52] <MarkoKaa> Can anyone help me with apache2 and subdomains? I must get domain.tld/~user to user.domain.tld automaticly when I add user :P
[10:52] <simon1992> i got a x2 3800+ before automatix they show two cpus after automatix or something don't know it shows 1 cpu
[10:52] <Huibert> IamUnique: yes, the system should run
[10:53] <Zehrila> There was an option in the system menu which listed my LAN card, my Wi-Fi card and my modem as the methods available to connect, and had checkboxes with each to enable/disable. I tried entering my dialp connection info in the modem option but there was no option to actually dial.
[10:53] <pradeep> IamUnique, yes
[10:53] <Spee_Der> gnotepad
[10:53] <Zehrila> Checking/unchecking the box didn't seem to dial.
[10:53] <Huibert> Zehrila: isn't there an aktivate/deactivate button to the right?
[10:53] <Spee_Der> sri, wrong window again...
[10:53] <frying_fish> simon1992: automatix is not a good idea
[10:53] <gaviin> surface: Thanks so much! Finally worked!
[10:53] <jimboedgynoob> Zehrila - my story. I am on a Laptop running Ubuntu talking wirelessly to a server running Windows 2000 that is using a wireless dongle. Win2000 is connected via Diallup. The only reason I'm using Win2000 on the server is that I cannot find a working driver for the dongle on Linux.
[10:54] <simon1992> frying fish why not?
[10:54] <frying_fish> because it does things to your system in the non-correct way
[10:54] <IamUnique> thanks
[10:54] <frying_fish> and as you have found out is quite likely to break things.
[10:54] <Terminus> MarkoKaa: hrmmm... mod_rewrite?
[10:54] <Zehrila> Huibert: Yups, there is a check-box to activate/deactivate but checking/unchecking it doesn't seem to do anything.
[10:54] <MarkoKaa> Terminus: hmm... .htaccess in /var/www ?
[10:54] <simon1992> frying can you tell me how i unchange that ?
[10:55] <Huibert> Zehrila: hhmmmm, it's a long time I ve used dailup
[10:55] <Zehrila> jimboedgynoob: I see. Well, I guess I'll try going to some hotel with a wifi hotspot in the evening to take care of the connectivity.
[10:55] <RoC_MM_0w> Mentioning Automatix...is EasyUbuntu more correct or less likely to break stuff?
[10:55] <frying_fish> nope, I don';t know what its actually done, or how to go back on it (because I have never used it, it just seems a silly thing to use when you can just get what you want yourself)
[10:55] <Huibert> Zehrila: must have been 1997 or something
[10:55] <Huibert> We used to write the ppd-up down chat script by hand in vi :-)
[10:55] <frying_fish> simon1992: it may be worth looking into getting the correct kernel.
[10:56] <Zehrila> Old times, eh?
[10:56] <Terminus> MarkoKaa: i don't actually know how to use mod_rewrite. i just know that you use it to rewrite urls. =D
[10:56] <Zehrila> BTW does Gnome offer some program like kppp for dial-up connections?
[10:56] <Huibert> Zehrila: yes, I was still young back then :-(
[10:56] <frying_fish> what I want to know is why use these "automatix" or "easyubuntu" scripts, when you can just search for applications in synaptic yourself.
[10:56] <Hirvinen> RoC_MM_0w: So I've heard. But I've also heard that it is bad as well. I Strongly suggest reading appropriate parts of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UserDocumentation
[10:56] <MarkoKaa> Terminus: Oh, I understand :)
[10:56] <frying_fish> (if not comfortable wit hthe command line)
[10:56] <jimboedgynoob> Zehrila: good luck! Or try and get a cheap Linux-compatible wireless device you can afford
[10:56] <tanlaan> Hello everyone
[10:57] <RoC_MM_0w> Hirvinen: the documentation mentions automatix and has install steps!
[10:57] <Terminus> MarkoKaa: was just suggesting what to use. =)
[10:57] <MarkoKaa> Terminus: Ok, thx ;)
[10:57] <gael> i said Trem ...
[10:57] <Terminus> MarkoKaa: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html if you want to read about it.
[10:58] <Zehrila> jimboedgynoob: My wireless device is gnu-compatible. The issue is, I don't have a wireless network here.
[10:58] <tanlaan> i have found a very interesting article on Linux. Its basically a comparison between Mac OS X applications and Linux applications. The article is at http://www.icefox.net/articles/kdeosx.php
[10:58] <tuna-fish-> Dumb question: when I boot up the computer it is possible to select "recovery mode" in which the computer logs in as root without the need for password. How can I make it so one needs a pw to do that?
[10:58] <simon1992> frying fish they showed it on giga so I used it BTW with that program you download the codecs and the graphics driver aswell
[10:58] <tanlaan> if anyone wants to talk about it, message me
[10:58] <jimboedgynoob> haha the Automatix page says "don't listen to the bad press you get on the ubuntu irc chat"  haha
[10:59] <frying_fish> simon1992: you can get all that direct from synaptic anyway
[10:59] <Zehrila> So does any of you know of some Gnome alternative for KDE's kppp?
[10:59] <frying_fish> and for "codecs" you can just install vlc
[10:59] <frying_fish> vlc will play 99.5% of video media.
[10:59] <simon1992> frying fish next time^^
[10:59] <xipietotec> jimboedgynoob: it also says #ubuntu ops kill puppies
[10:59] <Zehrila> Or the way to connect using dialup, from console with a non-GUI installation?
[10:59] <Huibert> jimboedgynoob: automatix will break your box in the long run, happened once will happen again.
[10:59] <Huibert> Until the automatix people start writing upgrade scripts for the new ubuntu releases
[11:00] <simon1992> frying fish i will install it from the synaptic
[11:00] <frying_fish> without the need for getting the w32 codecs. LRM contains your graphics drivers, a little bit of searching and you will learn this.
[11:00] <tanlaan> Oh, also i wanna talk to some hardcore linux fans/enthusiasts about why linux hasnt gone the way of OS X
[11:00] <DBO> xipietotec, mmmm puppy dog burgers...
[11:00] <frying_fish> automatix also changes things but it doesn't keep logs of it somewhere so going back and undoing it is quite difficult.
[11:00] <Huibert> Zehrila: use kppp in gnome
[11:00] <boink> but linux is open source, OS X isn't
[11:00] <xipietotec> tanlaan: way of OS X how?
[11:01] <simon1992> just fixing i would like to have the 2nd core
[11:01] <boink> and anyway, that belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic
[11:01] <jimboedgynoob> Hey xipie and Huibert I have broken so many Linux boxes (all my own) through sheer stupidity and noobness I have lost count 8-)
[11:01] <xipietotec> and don't bring out darwin as being open source.....because no one uses it =P
[11:01] <Huibert> tanlaan: it might be because linux is not going "anywhere" it's going _everywhere_
[11:01] <Zehrila> Huibert: That I can do after I install KDE, for which I need to go online, heh.
[11:01] <frying_fish> simon1992: check what kernel its running and make sure it is the correct version for your processor.
[11:01] <tanlaan> xipietotec: bringing all core applications togethor, and making UI's that use only things used most often and trying not to clutter the screen
[11:01] <gael> Roc: trem
[11:02] <gael> player ?
[11:02] <dv5237> whats a easy to use p2p way for ubuntu? (i already use torrents)
[11:02] <frying_fish> Zehrila: google not got advice for it?
[11:02] <frying_fish> dv5237: there is a torrent client by default, and you can install azureus from apt
[11:02] <simon1992> frying fish it "had" worked but now i doesnt
[11:02] <defrysk> dv5237, nicotine (soulseek clone)
[11:02] <Huibert> Zehrila: oh yes, not being online is a difficult concept to grasp for me
[11:02] <frying_fish> probably because your kernel got changed by automatix.
[11:02] <iami89> how do i install driver for my NVIDIA card {geforce 4 mx 440}?
[11:02] <Zehrila> Google certainly is a man's best friend.
[11:02] <Zehrila> Lemme see...
[11:02] <boink> !nvidia
[11:02] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:02] <Huibert> !nvidia
[11:02] <defrysk> dv5237, for a native torrentclient in linux try ktorrent
[11:02] <frying_fish> Zehrila: you seem to have a net connection now, so see what google says.
[11:03] <dv5237> defrysk: is that also for movies?
[11:03] <frying_fish> there is a torrent client built into gnome with ubuntu!
[11:03] <boink> !tell iami89 about nvidia
[11:03] <tanlaan> xipietotec: oh yea, check out the article i posted before http://www.icefox.net/articles/kdeosx.php
[11:03] <dv5237> defrysk: nicotine i mean
[11:03] <defrysk> dv5237, nicotine you mean ?
[11:03] <frying_fish> no need for anything extra, although again you can get azureus
[11:03] <dv5237> defrysk: yeah
[11:03] <defrysk> yes , mostly music but also movies
[11:03] <simon1992> frying fish if i install the default kernel will everything be all right? or does something change with the programs i use?
[11:04] <frying_fish> won't change your programs
[11:04] <defrysk> !p2p | dv5237
[11:04] <ubotu> dv5237: Conventional P2P clients: Limewire/GTK-Gnutella/Frostwire (Gnutella Network).  -  BitTorrent: see !torrent  -  Direct connect: try valknut.  -  Also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/P2PFileSharing for general information.
[11:04] <Taylor> Hello, How do I change my gdm login theme?
[11:04] <simon1992> frying fish where can i install the kernel? I think it'S difficult
[11:04] <Huibert> Taylor: administration->loginscreen
[11:04] <defrysk> Taylor, sudo gdmsetup
[11:05] <Taylor> OK thanks I meant by the source I downloaded
[11:05] <xipietotec> tanlaan: certain distros...and with certain amounts of customization allow you to do alot of that
[11:06] <jimboedgynoob> It saddens me that by running Linux I have to break the law by trying to play a DVD. It would be great to pay an amount to someone and then be able to do what you want, instead of being tied to Windows or OSX
[11:06] <tanlaan> xipietotec: Yes, but shouldnt this be a consideration for ALL linux distros?
[11:06] <xipietotec> gnome has drag and drop (I think KDE does too...but I'm not sure) for alot of stuff, simplified menus etc. KDE is overcluttered, and KDE 4.0 is designed to eliminate some of that.
[11:06] <Taylor> do I unzip the download?
[11:06] <xipietotec> tanlaan: No. different distros have different goals.
[11:06] <frying_fish> simon1992: select linux-image-generic (assuming your using edgy eft) from synaptic
[11:06] <frying_fish> an d it will get the rest it needs
[11:07] <frying_fish> then, reboot and make sure at grub (the boot loader) you select the generic one.
[11:07] <frying_fish>  or whatever you need
[11:07] <frying_fish> I have tgo leave
[11:07] <tanlaan> xipietotec: well shouldnt this be a central goal most common distros? To make easier to use and easier to understand.
[11:07] <compengi> anyone here works on froswire?
[11:07] <RoC_MM_0w> jimboedgynoob: this can be fixed by fixing the law.
[11:07] <compengi> frostwire*
[11:07] <defrysk> Taylor, in gdmsetup you can click add and then select the acrcived theme
[11:08] <elkbuntu> tanlaan, some people really truely do not like simplicity
[11:08] <defrysk> no need to unpack it
[11:08] <Sybux> Can some1 explain me how to create aliases with postfix
[11:08] <Taylor> I've found out myself
[11:08] <defrysk> good ;)
[11:08] <tanlaan> hahaha
[11:08] <Taylor> now how do I change my splash screen?
[11:09] <elkbuntu> FirstStrike, what was the point of that?
[11:09] <FirstStrike> To display you in my window, obviously.
[11:09] <xipietotec> tanlaan: different people have different ideas of what "useability" is, basically. and Linux does not "force" you to do anything one way.
[11:10] <RoC_MM_0w> or rather
[11:10] <nothlit> jimboedgynoob, not all distros do you break the law if you want to run something like linspire (rofl) then you rightfully pay for the use of the codecs and whatnot
[11:10] <xipietotec> take for instance the different UI philosophies behind Gnome and KDE
[11:10] <RoC_MM_0w> there are so many linuxes that you will never be forced to do things any one way
[11:10] <nothlit> or freespire
[11:10] <boink> FreeBSD has the codecs, no problem
[11:10] <boink> installing the codecs is easy in ubuntu, you just need to adjust the sources.list
[11:10] <jimboedgynoob> nothlit that is a good point - pay for the rights at distribution. Will it work?
[11:11] <boink> no, it won't work. free isfree
[11:11] <compengi> anyone here uses frostwire? i have a problem in running it
[11:11] <tanlaan> xipietotec: personally I see very little difference between KDE and Gnome
[11:12] <tanlaan> *idiot* http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=464540691509009245&q=linux&hl=en
[11:12] <gaviin> what does "su - root" do?
[11:12] <tanlaan> *this guy is an idiot
[11:12] <boink> gaviin: you just need to type "su"
[11:12] <boink> that gives you a root shell
[11:12] <xipietotec> tanlaan: Erm....there's alot of difference, one KDE attempts to integrate everything through konqueror, kde has alot more customization options than gnome (but gnome does some customization more intuitively) KDE comes with a gigantic load of applications
[11:12] <gaviin> ok, so its the same thing as sudo?
[11:12] <boink> yes
[11:12] <gaviin> k, thanks.
[11:13] <xipietotec> KDE's "Start bar" is more integrated (it's much better than the nautilus bar)
[11:13] <dv5237> hm when using xmule i get losing connection when i try to join a hub anyone a idea?
[11:13] <Taylor> How do I change my splash screen?
[11:13] <jimboedgynoob> boink: I'm trying to wean myself off proprietry codecs. Doesn't seem to work - the net is full of it
[11:14] <defrysk> xipietotec, matter of opinion take comments like that to ot
[11:15] <jimboedgynoob> Linus prefers kde (or so I read)
[11:15] <defrysk> jimboedgynoob, off-topic
[11:16] <jimboedgynoob> sorry
[11:16] <tanlaan> xipietotec: to me, the differences didnt change usability at all
[11:16] <Taylor> so no one here knows how to change the splash screen?
[11:16] <defrysk> !patience | Taylor
[11:16] <ubotu> Taylor: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[11:16] <xipietotec> KDE's biggest problems (for me) are: a.) When you want to change something you have 2000 options displayed for you....rather than moving the most common options to the front and putting advanced functions behind an "advanced" window....and b.) it looks too much like windows
[11:16] <Huibert> Taylor: tried google, it's not that hard
[11:16] <DARKGuy> Okay, I've been trying this stuff for days and I haven't been able to set up apache or anything that can serve a webpage on my home computer. Can somebody guide me for installing any webserver on my PC and that it's able to be seen from the outside?
[11:17] <tanlaan> xipietotec: well with those as problems, i see where your coming from
[11:17] <Taylor> I've been patience ;)
[11:17] <compengi> anyone here uses frostwire? i have a problem in running it
[11:17] <defrysk> Taylor, sudo apt-get install gtweakui
[11:18] <defrysk> Taylor, might help you out
[11:18] <tanlaan> Taylor: *patient
[11:18] <Taylor> ok i'll try that, thanks :D
[11:18] <defrysk> morning Seveas
[11:19] <defrysk> Good morning even
[11:19] <xipietotec> tanlaan: ergo, even though I think kde comes with a better application suite than gnome, I use gnome as my window manager.
[11:19] <Huibert> Taylor: try http://www.arsgeek.com/?p=470  it was only 2 Clicks away from google
[11:19] <iami89> how do i install plugin for media player in UBUNTU to play mp3 wmv mp4...?
[11:19] <Huibert> !mp3

[11:19] <tanlaan> xipietotec: Well do you know any linux distros that use the same thinking style as OS X?
[11:19] <antonio_> ciao a tutti
[11:19] <Taylor> To tell you the truth, i suck at my search words
[11:19] <jimboedgynoob> Does kde take less RAM than gnome or is it my imagination? It seems to be quiker
[11:20] <Huibert> Taylor: obiously.... I searched: "ubuntu change grub splahsscreen"
[11:20] <tanlaan> jimboedgynoob: yea it does take less RAM
[11:20] <Taylor> Huibert: I meant the ubuntu splash, not grub
[11:20] <jimboedgynoob> thanks tanlaan
[11:20] <antonio_> sono nuovo vorrei sapere se mi vedete, ciao
[11:21] <Huibert> Taylor: ahhh, there are so many splashscreens these days
[11:21] <defrysk> !it | antonio_
[11:21] <ubotu> antonio_: Vai su #ubuntu-it o su #kubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[11:22] <antonio_> ok tank you
[11:22] <g8y> Hi all, can anyone explain to me, why Ubuntu slows down to a crawl when I am copying files from USB-disks- an externalized hard-disk actually. Same thing with CDs. About 1800Mhz-intel pentium with 256MB- is that too slow?
[11:23] <RoC_MM_0w> no
[11:24] <jimboedgynoob> g8y - I have a similar system - I have a 256MB 1400Mhz - will plug in a USB stick - be right back
[11:24] <xipietotec> tanlaan: well, gnome shares some of the same goals, it does them in a slightly different way though.
[11:24] <RoC_MM_0w> g8y: it would also help if you said which release of Ubuntu you are using and if you've made any special changes.
[11:24] <g8y> RoC_MM_0w: I do wonder, whats the problem then. I've installed KDE too. and mostly on gnome, i've opened several pdfs, gphpedit (about 3 at most) and then there's amarok.
[11:24] <johan_> I have just successfully installed a SSL certificate on my intranet Apache server. How do I disable normal traffic ?? (I only wanna allow traffic through SSL)
[11:26] <Sybux> how can I create aliases for postfix ?
[11:26] <g0tw00d> does Ubuntu support SATA HD's and SATA ROM's?
[11:26] <g8y> no- nothing special- 6.06- I did upgrade the kernel- from the one it came with to the newest one- oh- and installed it fresh from a kubuntu CD- the ubuntu cd i downloaded was corrupt.
[11:26] <jimboedgynoob> g8y no problems here copying off USB stick and Ubuntu - no sluggish crawl
[11:27] <frogzoo> g0tw00d: yes & yes
[11:27] <RoC_MM_0w> g8y: a good question is did it do this before your kernel upgrade (if your kernel upgrade was a manual one)?
[11:27] <xipietotec> however...most distros tend to try and mimic alot of windows functions if you ask me. But beryl mimics certain things that OS X tiger does
[11:27] <g0tw00d> frogzoo: do I have to do something special?
[11:27] <frogzoo> g0tw00d: nope
[11:28] <g0tw00d> i keep getting errors on sr0
[11:28] <g0tw00d> it wont even boot it
[11:28] <kaptengu> is there any way I can import microsoft fonts to gnome, like you can do i KDE?
[11:28] <frogzoo> g0tw00d: the cd's ok is it?
[11:29] <xipietotec> kaptengu: Yes....but I don't remember how, it's listed in gnomelook
[11:29] <frogzoo> !fonts | kaptengu
[11:29] <ubotu> kaptengu: Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "msttcorefonts" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". No fonts in MPlayer? see !MPlayer
[11:29] <g0tw00d> frogzoo: i just used it yesterday for install
[11:29] <josh_> hey all... i have sound problems again
[11:29] <g0tw00d> looks ok
[11:29] <josh_> it worked 2 days ago
[11:29] <g8y> RoC_MM_0w: Most probably yes. I think the kernel did it but I am not altogether sure. if by manual, you are asking me whether I compiled my own, no. I just picked out the upgrade from synaptic.
[11:29] <kaptengu> thanks
[11:29] <g0tw00d> its a red disk .....
[11:29] <josh_> no settings have changed... sound just doesn't work
[11:29] <g0tw00d> are to see but not scratch that I can tell
[11:29] <g8y> heh. i remember someone telling me this earlier- synaptic is not a candy-store to pick off what ever you think you like.
[11:29] <g0tw00d> i thought about reloading it
[11:29] <g0tw00d> i mean reburning
[11:29] <josh_> card is new, ive changed between all the different sound engines... nothing
[11:29] <g0tw00d> ....lol
[11:29] <g0tw00d> long night
[11:29] <tanlaan> xipietotec: hmm ill check it out
[11:30] <compengi> anyone here uses frostwire? i have a problem in running it
[11:30] <xipietotec> tanlaan: beryl can do expose, and handles windows in similar ways, gnome deskbar-applet is like spotlight
[11:30] <g0tw00d> frogzoo: should I try reburning?
[11:31] <xipietotec> my desktop is very very minimalist
[11:32] <josh_> what is the directory for the soundcards?\
[11:32] <josh_> /dev/asound/soundcard?
[11:32] <RoC_MM_0w> g8y: pick whatever you'd like from the package system.
[11:33] <RoC_MM_0w> g0tw00d: try the "check cd for defects" option at livecd boot
[11:33] <frogzoo> g0tw00d: you could try reburning but at 50% of max speed
[11:33] <xipietotec> gdesklets are analogous to dashboard too
[11:33] <g0tw00d> ok ty.....never saw it
[11:33] <RoC_MM_0w> 8x! 8x! 8x1
[11:33] <xipietotec> although....admittedly, dashboard has a much wider collection of apps....and many of them are much better.
[11:34] <crimsun> josh_: for what?
[11:36] <simon-new> is here a admin? can he please unban me from ubuntu-de?
[11:36] <compengi> anyone here uses frostwire? i have a problem in running it
[11:36] <DBO> simon-new, please join #ubuntu-ops
[11:36] <g8y> simon-new: what did you do there? :P
[11:37] <simon-new> g8y nothing thats the matter
[11:37] <compengi> hey DBO
[11:37] <DBO> hi compengi
[11:37] <compengi> how's doing?
[11:37] <DBO> simon-new, if you join #ubuntu-ops please I will see that the matter is taken care of
[11:37] <tanlaan> xipietotec: beryl looks pretty cool
[11:38] <tanlaan> xipietotec: also looks very hard to install
[11:38] <RoC_MM_0w> tanlaan: for now.
[11:38] <simon-new> DBO i'm in
[11:38] <xipietotec> tanlaan: Depends....if you have intel graphics card its very easy
[11:38] <RoC_MM_0w> tanlaan: it's also not particularly hard, you just have to be able to follow 12 steps or what have you...it is all very detailed.
[11:39] <xipietotec> If you have NVIDIA, also pretty easy....if you have ATI....errr....well...yeah...um...about that....
[11:39] <DBO> simon-new, i dont see you in there
[11:39] <tanlaan> xipietotec: Oh, so have you read that article? "Nine things KDE should learn from Mac OS X"
[11:39] <simon-new> sry do i join in ubutnu-ops
[11:39] <tanlaan> RoC_MM_0w: atm i wouldnt be able to install it *faulty graphics card*
=== reverseblade_ is now known as reverseblade
[11:40] <xipietotec> tanlaan: yes, and I think there's a simple philosophical difference between KDE and OSX
[11:41] <xipietotec> KDE is everything and the kitchen sink
[11:41] <xipietotec> with a department of redundancy department thrown in
[11:41] <RoC_MM_0w> lots of stuff on right click menu
[11:41] <xipietotec> KDE does in fact have a common viewing application....it just also has 3-4 other viewers...."just in case"
[11:41] <tanlaan> xipietotec: Well go check out the difference between the two applications that open up the program "foo"
[11:42] <mc44> xipietotec: OSX is the hideous off spring of KDE mating with Gnome :)
[11:42] <tanlaan> mc44: hahaha
[11:42] <concept10> mc44, you have that backwards
[11:43] <xipietotec> tanlaan: Yeah....there's alot of IDE's that I don't like, but KDevelop is agian back to the above "Everything and the kitchen sink" approach
[11:43] <tanlaan> xipietotec: as it is, everything that OS X is bringing to the table, I expect linux to be up to par with
[11:44] <iami89> how to exit X-server
[11:44] <tanlaan> xipietotec: And at the moment it seems like linux is lacking just a bit
[11:44] <Spee_Der> simon-new: You were asked to join /#ubuntu-ops for assistance.
[11:44] <DBO> he has
[11:44] <Spee_Der> Ok, good morning DBO
[11:45] <DBO> morning Spee_Der =)
[11:45] <tanlaan> whats worse than 12 dead babies found in a dumpster?
[11:45] <Spee_Der> tanlaan: What's does that have to do with Ubuntu please ?
[11:45] <iami89> hhow do i exit X-server{for install NVIDIA driver}
[11:45] <xipietotec> tanlaan: OSX has one single view essentially of "What makes a good GUI" linux has *thousands* of views, ergo it is generally possible to find something that has a preferable GUI
[11:46] <tanlaan> Spee_Der: sorry i just remembered that joke *popped into my head*
[11:46] <nothlit> HIG <--
[11:46] <Spee_Der> !nvidia | iami89
[11:46] <ubotu> iami89: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:46] <RoC_MM_0w> tanlaan: 13 dead ones!
[11:46] <tanlaan> xipietotec: hmm, i guess i need to find my programs
[11:46] <tanlaan> RoC_MM_0w: 1 dead baby in 12 dumpsters
[11:46] <YoussefAssad> listen, where is the python-slang package in ubuntu?
[11:46] <Eons> uhm. xchat is behaving in a strange manner. it tried to send messages 5 hours ago [hopefully i didn't identify with ns] . how is this possible?
[11:47] <Taylor> is ubuntu gtk 1.x or gtk 2.x?
[11:47] <nothlit> Gnome2 runs gtk2 apps
[11:47] <tanlaan> xipietotec: there is a problem with me finding just the right GUI application
[11:48] <xipietotec> there's also the fact that there's dozens and dozens of window managers for linux as well: Fluxbox, enlightenment, KDE, gnome, xfce, beryl, compiz, etc.
[11:48] <tanlaan> xipietotec: I also want integration between them
[11:48] <mc44> tanlaan: please keep jokes of... questionable taste to #ubuntu-offtopic
[11:48] <Taylor> ok thanks for telling me
[11:48] <nothlit> xipietotec, I like that choice
[11:48] <heiko> has anyone seen a wlan problem where iwconfig looks ok (AP mac is displayed, wep is set up ok) but no data can be transmitted (e.g. dhcp doesn't get through)?
[11:48] <tanlaan> mc44: will do :D
[11:48] <mc44> tanlaan: and the correct punchline is one live one eating its way out
[11:48] <xipietotec> tanlaan: KDE actually is built with integration in mind, kparts allows easy integration between applications
[11:48] <Huibert> heiko: I had that once, because I couldn't get wep/wpa to run
[11:49] <nothlit> xipietotec, people wouldn't have their fancy beryl to show off without that choice, and you wouldn't be able to run linux on legacy hardware without lightweight wms
[11:49] <xipietotec> they just...need to refine their vision a bit if you ask me
[11:49] <heiko> Huibert: so you saw the AP mac in iwconfig? did you solve that problem?
[11:49] <bXi> yo
[11:49] <Huibert> heiko: I only used some commandline comamnds.
[11:49] <xipietotec> Basically, for my home computer I use gnome, but if I had a business I'd set up the business comps using KDE.
[11:50] <Huibert> heiko: didn't get it to run, switched off encryption at the router, rpoblem solved :-)
[11:50] <heiko> Huibert: anything besides the usual ifconfig/iwconfnig
[11:50] <tanlaan> mc44: wrong joke there btw, thats "whats worse than a pile of dead babies"
[11:50] <nothlit> xipietotec, why wouldn't you do it the other way around?
[11:50] <heiko> oh
[11:50] <Spee_Der> ted
[11:50] <heiko> i guess i should try that
[11:50] <xipietotec> nothlit: I'm not knocking the variety =) I'm explaining that the variety is what makes linux different than OSX.
[11:50] <nothlit> xipietotec, less options in both applications/configuration confuses non techies
[11:50] <nothlit> err more options confuses*
[11:51] <bXi> i tried to update dapper 64bit to edgy
[11:51] <Huibert> heiko: you should be aware off you wlan enviroment, and at least use an MAC filter at the router.
[11:51] <tanlaan> nothlit: who said i was a non techie? :P
[11:51] <Spee_Der> !ted
[11:51] <ubotu> ted: graphical RTF (Rich Text Format) editor, stable lesstif version. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.17-1 (edgy), package size 654 kB, installed size 1732 kB
[11:51] <tanlaan> *""
[11:51] <Spee_Der> hmmm
[11:51] <heiko> Huibert: i understand security ... just don't understand why wlan (or wep?) seems to become gradually more broken with newer versions of ubuntu
[11:51] <nothlit> tanlaan, oh i was just reading what xipietotec said, and I was referring to business people as non -techies
[11:51] <xipietotec> nothlit: KDE's interface bugs me, looks too much like windows, and while it has several applications I like, it also has application overload, it's also overly complex to configure (.e.g., window customization etc.), but the application suites and the fact it looks like windows makes it easier for business integration
[11:52] <tanlaan> nothlit: ahh hahaha
[11:52] <xipietotec> plus there's the fact that KDE is built with a little more eye toward the corporate user.
[11:52] <Spee_Der> Is anyone here Opera smart ?
[11:52] <dyland> hi
[11:52] <tanlaan> xipietotec: are there any inegration applications for Gnome?
[11:52] <nothlit> xipietotec, you can modify gnome-panel, and theres gcontol and gnome-control-(center)
[11:53] <nothlit> Spee_Der, i use opera
[11:53] <bXi> but now i still have 41 packages that are kept back
[11:53] <xipietotec> nothlit: I'm well aware (I have a severely modified gnome).
[11:53] <bXi> how do i get those packages
[11:53] <dyland> ubuntu supports intel core 2 duo?
[11:53] <nothlit> xipietotec, also, sabayon and pessulus make it easier for business now
[11:53] <Spee_Der> Using the IRC built into Opera, I'd like to change the main screen color from blasting white to something a bit paler, like maybe cream color ? How to do this please as I can't find the correct options (anywhere).
[11:53] <nothlit> lol you're using irc built into opera?
[11:53] <nothlit> lemme check
[11:54] <Spee_Der> Yes. It is working just great  too.....
[11:54] <nothlit> btw theres a hidden config place in opera with the new version  address bar opera:config
[11:54] <xipietotec> tanlaan: the best analogy is probably to imagine Gnome as a monolithic application (it tries to make everything integrated as a single big piece) while KDE is micro-kernel-application (.e.g, it's easier to integrate other things, because its made up of millions of little pieces)
[11:55] <Spee_Der> Hmmm, will look into that also. Thanks. I usually go there first with any browser....
[11:55] <tanlaan> xipietotec: hmm
[11:55] <Spee_Der> I'm using build 9, version 344 btw
[11:55] <xipietotec> long term I think KDE has a big advantage over gnome: kparts + (unfortunately) it looks and in some respects behaves like windows users would expect.
[11:56] <nothlit> Spee_Der, http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStyles/ http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStyles/extraChatStyles.html
[11:56] <Spee_Der> nothlit: Many thanks....
[11:56] <xipietotec> while gnome is actually much better for setting up grandma with a new computer, because its stupidly easy to do everything.
[11:56] <dyland> I cant install ubuntu, i bought a computer with core 2 duo and a sata hardisck
[11:57] <bXi> how do i get my packages that are kept back
[11:57] <Spee_Der> nothlit: Ohhh, very nice indeed, thank you so much.....  bbiab.
[11:57] <tanlaan> xipietotec: haha ok
[11:57] <xipietotec> however, by being so....many options for customization just aren't there, compared to kde.
[11:57] <nothlit> Spee_Der, :)
[11:57] <Tominator> oh nothlit, thanks again, the installation of the old driver worked fine ;)
[11:57] <nothlit> bXi, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:57] <xipietotec> basically I'd like to fork KDE and create knome.
[11:57] <Xteven> hi, does anyone know if there is any work being done on compiling third party kernel modules ? because the current method seems pretty elaborate
[11:57] <Locutu5> Is anyone able to tell me why chown waits for around five minutes when using a numeric id but works instantly using a name id. This happened after installing smbldap
[11:58] <nothlit> Tominator, oh you got it working? Thats great :D!
[11:58] <ooswoosh> a
[11:58] <g0tw00d> why does usb mouse on ubuntu seem to lock up ever 15 minutes?
[11:58] <xipietotec> which would be a gnome like GUI with a vastly scaled down app database from KDE and integration way of kparts.
[11:58] <g0tw00d> i have to unplug and plugin to get it to work again
[11:58] <tanlaan> xipietotec: So basically, if I were to attempt to do things the way I want...I would want to get KDE and find the versions of the main programs I want, then customize my system to use those specific programs and try to integrate them together?
[11:58] <nothlit> Tominator, btw amaranth has a new repo for the nvidia 9 drivers, although i suspect you won't want to touch your drivers at all for a long while
[11:59] <nothlit> xipietotec, whats wrong with kdebase + install one by one then?
[11:59] <Locutu5> who here has experience with smbldap?
[11:59] <nolimitsoya> tanlaan, im not sure what you are aming for, but you could do a cli install, and apt-get the little bits of software you need :)
[11:59] <xipietotec> tanlaan: the KDE apps are likely to be integrated allready, if they come with the kde suite, if you're a programmer you can write or integrate custom applications and integrate them better because of kparts
[11:59] <tanlaan> nolimitsoya: cli?
[12:00] <nolimitsoya> command line interface
[12:00] <tanlaan> ahh
[12:00] <Tominator> nothlit, before I do that, I have to know if AIGLX works with these new drivers ^^ AND if AIGLX works less buggy than XGL
[12:00] <Tominator> ^^
[12:00] <nothlit> kubuntu does gtk integratoin pretty well
[12:00] <nolimitsoya> xipietotec, you could just apt-get kde-core, and then the sortware you realy want
[12:01] <xipietotec> nothlit: I'm talking about just creating a light weight version of KDE with certain aspects of gnome (like easy drag and drop installation of themes, wallpapers, etc, most common customization options being default, with all the advanced ones that KDE has being thrown under advanced tabs).
[12:01] <nothlit> Tominator, I got beryl working with the 1.0-9 drivers fine, I don't know about less buggy but its pretty stable and much much faster than xgl
[12:01] <tanlaan> Bah, I hate how OS X got around the rules of open source
[12:01] <nothlit> Tominator, also, beryl contacts the nvidia card directly, no aiglx :)
[12:01] <Tominator> nothlit, are there good howtos on the ubuntu-wiki?
[12:01] <nolimitsoya> tanlaan, they didnt. they use a dsb license
[12:01] <Tominator> nothlit, since when?
[12:01] <Tominator> ^^
[12:01] <nolimitsoya> *bsd
[12:01] <nothlit> Tominator, I think so, or you can use beryl-project.org
[12:02] <nothlit> Tominator, since before edgy came out
[12:02] <xipietotec> tanlaan: they use a bsd liscense, essentially OSX is Darwin (A custom BSD) + OSX architecture.
[12:02] <Tominator> nothlit, but why do the title-bars disappear when i run beryl-manager?
[12:02] <nothlit> Tominator, I fooled around the nvidia + beryl (no aiglx needed :)) in edgy beta
[12:02] <xipietotec> only the OSX architecture is closed source.
[12:02] <tanlaan> xipietotec: I know
[12:02] <tanlaan> xipietotec: thats what I meant
[12:02] <nothlit> Tominator, that means emerald isn't working properly
[12:03] <nolimitsoya> tanlaan, thats not getting around anything. thats the whole point with the bsd license :P
[12:03] <Tominator> nothlit, do you know how to fix this?
[12:03] <Riddell> xipietotec: sounds like you want to work on improving kde itself
[12:03] <nolimitsoya> ... as opposed to, say, gpl
[12:03] <nolimitsoya> :)
[12:03] <nothlit> Tominator, emerald is the window decorator , beryl is the window manager
[12:03] <tanlaan> nolimitsoya: But OS X did little to change Darwin
[12:03] <Tominator> nothlit, yeah, now i know ;)
[12:03] <user-land> Hello, is there an easy way to install a local DNS cache for faster browsing ?
[12:03] <nothlit> Tominator, i would suggest running beryl/beryl-manager from the terminal and check/google the errors
[12:03] <tanlaan> nolimitsoya: they just built their architecture on top of it
[12:04] <dyland> ubuntu works with intel core 2 duo???
[12:04] <nolimitsoya> tanlaan, that is, still, the entire point of the bsd license.
[12:04] <nothlit> Tominator, I use screen, but you could probably do it from the virtual console and specify a display
[12:04] <xipietotec> Riddell: Pretty much, I'm thinking of a "lighter weight" KDE, suitable for home users.
[12:04] <nothlit> dyland, it should work with the generic kernel
[12:04] <Tominator> nothlit, kay... but, what version of nvidia-drivers do i need?
[12:04] <nothlit> Tominator, you need 1.0-9629
[12:05] <nolimitsoya> xipietotec, thats what kde-core if for. then you just do all the configurations you want, roll it up and call it xipietotux :)
[12:05] <nothlit> anything lower doesn't have the compositing features needed
[12:05] <nothlit> !nvidia
[12:05] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:05] <nothlit> !Amaranth
[12:05] <ubotu> For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[12:05] <nothlit> there tominator ^
[12:05] <xipietotec> nolimitsoya: I know I know =P but there's some portions of the KDE gui I don't like either.
[12:05] <compengi> anyone here uses frostwire? i have a problem in running it
[12:05] <xipietotec> not just the apps.
[12:05] <Tominator> nothlit, errmm.. not good... I was unable to do fullscreenmode and to run wine with this driver ;)
[12:05] <tanlaan> nolimitsoya: well my thoughts on the license are that, because the architecture cannot be use without the kernel it should be under the same license
[12:05] <nolimitsoya> xipietotec, all that can be customiced
[12:06] <Tominator> and the newer beta won't install
[12:06] <nolimitsoya> tanlaan, then you havnt read the sam license i did :)
[12:06] <nothlit> Tominator, lol then you have to build it yourself or fix your error messages or give up
[12:06] <nothlit> Tominator, you could always just wait around a bit
[12:07] <Tominator> nothlit, build myself? but how? i used this .run file from the nvidia page ^^
[12:07] <xipietotec> Yeah....but I'm not up to the amount of customization and integration it would require. (I'd want to integrate the hell out of everything.)
[12:07] <nothlit> TomB|, yeah the nvidia installer is what i meant
[12:07] <user-land> How can i see what DNS server my Ubuntu is using ?
[12:08] <nolimitsoya> xipietotec, integrate as in... what? things dont get much more integrated than metapackages with linux :)
[12:08] <nothlit> xipietotec, what you want sounds like it would take an incredible amount of hacking or starting from scratch
[12:08] <Spee_Der> hmmm
[12:08] <nothlit> nolimitsoya, it sounds like he wants a perfectly integrated customised fusion of his best of kde and gnome
[12:08] <nothlit> xipietotec, correct me if i'm wrong of course
[12:08] <xipietotec> its kinda sad too though, KDE allready has several good integration features, integrated Konqueror web-browser/file browser wasn't a bad I dea (I think the implementation is annoying)...but its kinda made obsolete because everyone uses FF, thunderbird, insertfavapp here, instead.
[12:09] <nolimitsoya> nothlit, that should be hard, as ive already explained :)
[12:10] <nolimitsoya> its perfectly simple to load both qt and gtk at boot, cutting down loadtimes as well :) itll just cost you an extra ~20mb memory footprint :)
[12:10] <nolimitsoya> tanlaan, :P
[12:10] <nothlit> gtk /qt apps can look pretty integrated with polymer and qtcurve and the gtk qt engines but backend hacking would probably require infrastructure overhauls
[12:10] <tanlaan> *BSD license
[12:10] <xipietotec> And yeah, what I'm describing would actually be a major rewrite of several core kde apps.
[12:11] <nothlit> The bsd license is ideal in theory
[12:11] <xipietotec> of course....KDE 4 may end up being more along the lines of what I want (well...the GUI) since they're getting rid of some things.
[12:11] <nolimitsoya> na, /me likes the "viral" structure of gpl better :D
[12:11] <josh_> sorry to but in, but what does the BSD license offer over the GPL?
[12:11] <nothlit> other than the old addition of the copywrite/development notice thing
[12:11] <nolimitsoya> world dominion for free software :D
[12:11] <tanlaan> nothlit: to be ideal i think it must include that you MUST keep your source open for download *one i read didnt say that*
[12:11] <nolimitsoya> josh_, the option to go closed source at any given time
[12:11] <nothlit> josh_, True free software to do what you wish
[12:12] <Tominator> !amerald
[12:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about amerald - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:12] <xipietotec> nothlit: BSD = Do whatever you want. GPL = "Your free do what you want, so long as you make sure others are too."
[12:12] <nothlit> tanlaan, gpl or bsd? gpl requires at least 18 months i think, probably more
[12:12] <Tominator> !Emerald
[12:12] <tanlaan> that would be why i like the GPL better
[12:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Emerald - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:12] <Tominator> !Amaranth
[12:12] <ubotu> For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[12:13] <tanlaan> nothlit: bsd, but the gpl covers that
[12:13] <josh_> nolimitsoya: thanks.
[12:13] <nothlit> xipietotec, i was just referring to the original bsd license which has a phrase you had to put in every advertisement, that people modified several times
[12:13] <tanlaan> http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php
[12:13] <xipietotec> information is a pure public good, GPL is an inherent recognition of that, and seeks to defend that vs. technical measures to defeat that purpose.
[12:14] <nothlit> tanlaan, lol bsd license means you don't have to release your source code at all
[12:14] <tanlaan> nothlit: I got that :P
[12:14] <tanlaan> nothlit: I just have a GPL kind of mind :P
[12:14] <nothlit> tanlaan, actually you don't have to release your source code off gpl at all if you don't "distribute" it as defined by gnu
[12:15] <ompaul> tanlaan, nothlit, xipietotec can you move the licence discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic please this is strictly a support channel thanks
[12:15] <xipietotec> sorry sorry =)
[12:15] <ompaul> xipietotec, I know I get caught up in that kind of thing :)
[12:16] <g0tw00d> why does usb mouse on ubuntu seem to lock up ever 15 minutes?
[12:16] <g0tw00d> i have to unplug and plugin to get it to work again
[12:17] <Xteven> hi
[12:18] <Xteven> I think there is a bug in the ivtv-source package of edgy
[12:18] <g0tw00d> god damn this is annoying....argh!
[12:18] <ver0niqu3> hi all
[12:19] <Xteven> well, maybe not. it worked the second time
[12:20] <g0tw00d> how do I turn on the sources?
[12:20] <Spee_Der> bbiab, dog wants out. . .

[12:25] <Spee_Der> There's gott'a be an easier way nothlit.....
[12:26] <josh_> sorry to be a little off-topic, but my installation of dapper keeps failing at 73%. Running a "Check the CD for defects" returns no errors and I experience no error dialogs or information during the installation, it just seems to hang at 73%. I am using a ship-it CD and it is my last copy (gave the rest away), so I am stumped for ideas and may have to download another copy... Any suggestions?
[12:26] <Yasha> I have seen some articles on this in the forum, but is there a patch yet to fix suspend? Hibernate works, but suspending to disk or ram doesn't function.
[12:27] <nothlit> Spee_Der, use a css editor i suppose, or you can google for it. opera's help database has a lot of useful stuff
[12:27] <nothlit> Spee_Der, the opera help forum is pretty nice as well
[12:27] <Spee_Der> Yeh...
[12:27] <Spee_Der> Ok, I'll look there also.....

[12:38] <Fortis> Ubuntu has gnome, Kubuntu has KDE
[12:38] <Alarm> okie thank you
[12:39] <Alarm> one more question. in case i will isntall kubuntu, cant i add also gnome on it ?
[12:39] <Zac1> @hamster
[12:39] <nolimitsoya> Alarm, yes
[12:39] <bewd> !wine
[12:39] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[12:39] <nolimitsoya> Alarm, though, itll be a complete mess :)
[12:39] <ramon> hi all this is prob q noob question but with what command can I see what programs I have running?
[12:39] <apokryphos> Alarm: check the faq
[12:40] <Alarm> and a last question.. does ubuntu  have during the installation the choice of gnome or kde , or for kde i 'must' download kde
[12:40] <Spee_Der> ramon: In a terminal try ps ax
[12:40] <ramon> thanks
[12:40] <Alarm> apokryphos i am not in the mood download a few gb and not to be what i want
[12:40] <bewd> how can i install wine on ubuntu ?
[12:40] <Fortis> Get a free CD then
[12:40] <apokryphos> Alarm: then read the faq please.
[12:40] <apokryphos> bewd: /msg ubotu wine
[12:41] <Spee_Der> bewd: In a terminal window use, 'sudo apt-get install wine'
[12:41] <Spee_Der> Or you could use synaptic
[12:41] <bewd> Spee_Der: ok
[12:41] <Alarm> whats so hard in saying a yes or no at this question, dont get it

[12:50] <Spee_Der> Good morning Lynoure
[12:50] <ramon> how can I see what ver im running ps ax lets me see all programs im running
[12:50] <[^Twen^1> Fortis: what do you mean, now? =P
[12:50] <gnomefreak> ramon: lsb_release -a
[12:50] <Fortis> Twen: You need to be root to do that
[12:50] <ramon> thanks gnomefreak
[12:50] <gnomefreak> yw
[12:51] <Fortis> As non-superuser you only can make folders in your one directory
[12:51] <Fortis> Twen: /home/username/
[12:51] <abo> anyone can help me mount my Digital camera in ubuntu... Daper used to detect it automatically... with edgy I can't see it
[12:52] <ramon> gnomefreak can you also tell me how i can edit my sshd daemon in VI?
[12:52] <[^Twen^1> Fortis: ok? how can I be root, then? Though it is my system.. Im using the ubuntu-server right now to chat the IRC
[12:52] <[^Twen^1> Fortis: ahh, I'll check that out
[12:52] <Fortis> Twen: OK
[12:52] <gnomefreak> ramon: nope sorry cant :(
[12:53] <ramon> np thanks anyway ;)
[12:53] <gnomefreak> ramon: why use vi? use something easy ;)
[12:53] <reverseblade> how can I prevent my users to delete a directory itself, but they should be able to create files within
[12:53] <gnomefreak> brb
[12:53] <reverseblade> gnomefreak, learning vim pays off
[12:53] <ramon> well i have to learn to work with it because we use it at work also ;)
[12:54] <ramon> anyone else who can tell me how to edit my sshd cfg in VI?
[12:54] <reverseblade> ramon, no matter what do not use the cursor keys
[12:54] <nothlit> you could probably set the sticky flag or chmod the dir
[12:54] <Fortis> reverseblad: I don't know exactly how, but you need chmod
[12:54] <[^Twen^1> Fortis: just found the /home/username-folder, but there is nothing in it but a desktop, and a example-folder..
[12:54] <Fortis> Twen: That's fine
[12:54] <reverseblade> ramon, sudo vim /path/to/file
[12:54] <Fortis> Twen: Put your stuff in there
[12:54] <ramon> thanksreversblade I will try that
[12:55] <onthos> Can anyone help me with my joystick?
[12:55] <reverseblade> ramon, type i to get into insert mode, press escape to normal mode , :wq to save and quit , etc
[12:55] <onthos> Er... that sounds dirtier than it really is.
[12:55] <[^Twen^1> Fortis: so I should download all programs and stuff to that folder+
[12:55] <[^Twen^1> ?
[12:55] <ramon> thanks again reversblade
[12:55] <Fortis> Twen: I should do that, yes
[12:57] <[^Twen^1> Fortis: ok, just saw the apache-root-folder was located /var/www    so how can I put files in that one when it's protected?
[12:57] <Fortis> Uhm... via the shell using sudo.. I'm not sure, try that
[12:58] <reverseblade> how can I prevent my users to delete a directory itself, but they should be able to create files within ?
[01:00] <gnomefreak> ramon: my point was learn vim on a file you make not one that is important. vim isnt hard to learn just takes some time to learn the commands
[01:00] <dcordes> !botsnack
[01:00] <ubotu> Yum!
[01:00] <abo> when I do lsusb, I get a list of entries such as "Bus 005 Device 004: ID 054c:0010" , how can I tell which node/device in /dev this usb device can be access, I need to know to try to mount it as vfat
[01:00] <eilker> is /etc/init.d folder consist of files of needing at booting ? i mean all files are needed for booting in /etc/init.d ? or do we have more ?
[01:01] <jikanter> eilker: you need these, as well as a few more..
[01:02] <gnomefreak> make a file that has stupid info in it and edit it with vim that way nothing gets messed up. always learn what the files do and how they do it before editing it just to edit it. if you going to edit a file that is needed and cant be messed up use nano or gedit or whatever until you learn your way around a file and around vim
[01:02] <eilker> jikanter: what are the left? where are the left ?
[01:02] <jikanter> huh?
[01:02] <jikanter> elker: what is the left? you mean the rest of the files you need to boot?
[01:03] <dbe> How do I enter the menu bar in GUI applications (File, View etc...) with a shortcut?
[01:03] <jikanter> dbe: right-click on desktop, add-shortcut to nautilus /usr/bin/nautilus
[01:03] <nolimitsoya> dbe, alt+underlined hotkey
[01:03] <gnomefreak> dbe: what are you trying to do. like lets say you want to open a tab in gnome-terminal you could use shift+ctrl+t
[01:04] <jikanter> dbe: do you mean a click shortcut or a keyboard shortcut?
[01:04] <dbe> jikanter, Keyboard.
[01:04] <jikanter> oh
[01:05] <eilker> jikanter: yes exactly
[01:05] <dbe> nolimitsoya, Shift+_ HOTKEY does not work for me.
[01:05] <dbe> nolimitsoya, RIght, Alt.
[01:05] <dbe> nolimitsoya, Thanks.
[01:06] <jikanter> eilker: well, you need the /etc/rcX.d files for one
[01:06] <nolimitsoya> dbe, does for me. :) (xfce, though...) alt+f gives me file menu in firefox :)
[01:06] <dbe> nolimitsoya, Alt+HOTKEY is fine.
[01:06] <bewd> Spee_Der: and where i install the program ?
[01:06] <jikanter> eilker: meaning rc0.d rc1.d rc2.d etc

[01:31] <DARKGuy> Okay, anybody here with experience in any webserver program? I've been trying to set up a webserver service in my home pc for days and haven't found the way how to. Please if someone can guide me step-by-step I would be really glad, because all I can do is install the programs, but it doesn't allows outside access!
[01:32] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: have a look at www.howtoforge.com --> they have several tutorials for setting up LAMP on *ubuntu
[01:32] <porkpie> Hi guy's I have just moved my websites to an ubuntu server but on a couple of sites I am getting this error Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
[01:32] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: LAMP is for Server ubuntu cd, right? or does it work for desktop ubuntu install too?
[01:32] <ompaul> DarkED, I think you have the program set up what you need to do is modify your "router/firewall"
[01:33] <nothlit> DARKGuy, you probably have a router/firewall/proxy problem or your ISP may block ports like 80 and 25
[01:33] <DARKGuy> DarkED: It works because it does in Windows.
[01:33] <nothlit> LAMP is linux apache mysql php
[01:33] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: no, LAMP is an acryonm for Linux Apache MySQL PHP
[01:33] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: you can install that still on the desktop ubuntu installs... that's not a big problem
[01:33] <DarkED> Um..
[01:33] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: Ah, I'll try on that site then, thanks
[01:33] <DarkED> I have no idea what you guys just pm'd me about :D
[01:34] <nothlit> hmm.. does ubuntu have a lamp metapackage?
[01:34] <nothlit> DarkED, lol we didn't pm you
[01:34] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: however running a lamp I would rather advice on using debian sarge :)
[01:34] <DarkED> nothlit: You didnt, but two others did. something about a router?

[01:41] <hyper_ch> it has a modem connected... so it may very well be the case that the modem also is a router

[01:46] <birkett> np, im sure someone else has the same problem
[01:46] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: okay, just a sec
[01:46] <nothlit> did you try the ebuntu documentation?
[01:46] <birkett> looking on the forums, theres nly 4 threads relating too it though
[01:46] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: says it's already running
[01:46] <nothlit> I think theres some floating around somewhere
[01:46] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: that's good :)
[01:46] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: it started it when it finished installing, anyways
[01:46] <javaJake> birkett, I'd google, though. Something like "frozen 22gnome_panel_data" or "stuck 22gnome_panel_data".
[01:47] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: that part it is :)
[01:47] <nothlit> DARKGuy, did you check your apache config  files?
[01:48] <DARKGuy> nothlit: I want to modify them, but I dunno what to edit in order to make it visible from the outside
[01:48] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: I can ping you but I can't access your apache
[01:48] <nothlit> birkett, does it always freeze? did you checksum the disc?
[01:48] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: see? that's what happens
[01:48] <hyper_ch> nothlit can you try to access his IP by a browser?
[01:48] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: However, I have the index displaying right here
[01:48] <pradeepvglughyd> hey anyone suggest a good manual for enlightenment(e17) on ubuntu
[01:49] <nothlit> hyper_ch, pinged it and tried to visit it as soon as he pasted his ip
[01:49] <javaJake> birkett, oh, you running livecd?
[01:49] <DARKGuy> nothlit: It wasn't up when I pasted the IP :P
[01:49] <hyper_ch> nothlit: but no success either right?
[01:49] <javaJake> birkett, yea, I'd run the "Check CD" thing first ALWAYS. If any _ONE_ thing is messed up, it's bound to cause problems one way or another.
[01:49] <nothlit> hyper_ch, well, the pinging worked rofl
[01:49] <DARKGuy> nothlit: right now it is, or so it see I only see an apache2-default folder in the browser
[01:49] <DARKGuy> *seems
[01:50] <birkett> javajake: I passed the media check :P
[01:50] <reverseblade> How do I enable ACL ?
[01:50] <nothlit> DARKGuy, btw you configuration files are in /etc and the server files are in /var/www
[01:50] <nothlit> htdocs
[01:50] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: well, no clue... sorry
[01:50] <javaJake> birkett, oh, ok
[01:50] <DARKGuy> hyper_ch: s'okay, big thanks for trying ^^;;
[01:50] <javaJake> birkett, try this: when you boot the livecd push f6.
[01:50] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Yup, I know that :P
[01:51] <Vorbote> reverseblade: it depends on your filesystem.
[01:51] <birkett> yup
[01:51] <DARKGuy> nothlit: I wonder, does this normal install of apache2 makes it accessible from the outside by default or do you have to edit something in order to do so?
[01:51] <javaJake> birkett, then erase the "quiet" and "splash" words, and push enter.
[01:51] <reverseblade> Vorbote, since this is #ubuntu , what file system I could be using ?
[01:51] <birkett> okies
[01:51] <DARKGuy> Vorbote: ext3 IIRC
[01:52] <nothlit> DARKGuy, ubuntu's automatically does from what i remember
[01:52] <javaJake> birkett, that'll give you verbose output about what's going on.
[01:52] <nothlit> DARKGuy, i don't have it installed atm
[01:52] <javaJake> birkett, that might help.
[01:52] <birkett> ya
[01:52] <Vorbote> reverseblade: that's a combination of religigous belief and personal experience. But as DARKGuy points out (erroneusly to me, btw) ext3 is the default in Debian and derivatives.
[01:52] <nothlit> DARKGuy, have you tried accessing other services from 'remote' computers?
[01:52] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Hm, do you know what to edit, so I can change the listening port, for example? it's the last thing that comes to mind :/
[01:52] <birkett> ill see what happens, hpefully wont have to stare at 80% for an hour
[01:52] <javaJake> birkett, lol
[01:52] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Yes, VNC works
[01:52] <neverm1nd> where skype saves passwords?
[01:53] <knix_> neverm1nd: they're encrypted
[01:53] <nothlit> DARKGuy, just find the port entry in the apache.ini (i think it should be there)
[01:53] <reverseblade> Vorbote, you are very helpful, in deed
[01:53] <Vorbote> reverseblade: in the case of ext2/3/4 you use tune2fs to enable ACLs in the filesystem.
[01:53] <nothlit> like ctrl+f find it (or C^W if you're using nano)
[01:53] <DARKGuy> nothlit: is there an apache.ini in linux oO whoah
[01:53] <reverseblade> alright
[01:53] <hyper_ch> DARKGuy: changing apache port is in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf I think
[01:53] <reverseblade> Vorbote, I have just installed a package called ACL
[01:53] <neverm1nd> knix_:  I've just installed skype and it's showing that wrong pass
[01:53] <nothlit> ^ there you go :)
[01:53] <DARKGuy> Ah, there, thanks hyper_ch :)
[01:54] <Vorbote> reverseblade: yes, you need the userspace tools to be able to manipulate ACLs in the filesystem
[01:54] <nothlit> DARKGuy, lol i guess not, sry, I don't have apache installed atm so I can't check
[01:54] <Spee_Der> Good morning DARK
[01:54] <DARKGuy> nothlit: S'okay, I found it xD
[01:54] <DARKGuy> hey Spee_Der! good morning, how it's going :)
[01:54] <javaJake> neverm1nd, you could delete the entire .skype folder.
[01:54] <Spee_Der> Very well & you ?
[01:54] <A3n> iwlist scan cant find my AP
[01:55] <reverseblade> alright, one more thing Vorbote , is it worth enough to deal ? do you think it is stable ? and why it is not enabled by default in gnu linux? or will it be in the future ?
[01:55] <A3n> i dont know what to do
[01:55] <neverm1nd> javaJake: where can I find it?
[01:55] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: quite good thanks, trying to set up apache for outside access >.<
[01:55] <javaJake> neverm1nd, under your home folder.
[01:55] <nothlit> DARKGuy, the problem is that you said a windows http server was accessible, which pretty much rules out almost everything, except a firewall config
[01:55] <Spee_Der> Very nice.
[01:55] <javaJake> neverm1nd, but I haven't worked wiht skype a lot, so it may not be called .skype.
[01:55] <neverm1nd> javaJake: I'll try ;)
[01:55] <DARKGuy> nothlit: and there's no firewall active right now so :P
[01:55] <neverm1nd> javaJake: thanks for help
[01:55] <Spee_Der> We are watching Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons.
[01:55] <javaJake> A3n, does it work for other APs?
[01:55] <DARKGuy> xD cool
[01:55] <javaJake> neverm1nd, np
[01:56] <A3n> javaJake:didnt try yet
[01:56] <nothlit> DARKGuy, iptables -L
[01:56] <A3n> javaJake:trying to get my internet to work
[01:56] <javaJake> A3n, yea... what card do ya have?
[01:56] <eyalw> how do I set my away msg on gaim? the gaim channel wasn't any help
[01:56] <A3n> javaJake:installed the driver with ndiswrapper
[01:56] <javaJake> A3n, ok, good good
[01:56] <A3n> javaJake: Prism Javelin/xbow
[01:56] <javaJake> A3n, and ndiswrapper says all's well?
[01:57] <A3n> Intersil something something
[01:57] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT), Forward & output have empty fields
[01:57] <Vorbote> reverseblade: it is very stable. Particularly in the case of extX because that was the first file system where ACLs were implemented. (XFS was the second; reiserfs is a hack, JFS is very recent but works nicely). The reason is is not enabled by default is perhaps historic; ACLs are used in massive multi-user setups mostly and that was the domain of Solaris and AIX in the past.
[01:57] <A3n> javaJake:well its installed correctly and modprobe ndiswrapper doesnt error
[01:57] <reverseblade> Vorbote, and for the future , what is your expectations ?
[01:57] <javaJake> A3n, does "ndiswrapper -l" say it is installed AND the hardware is present?
[01:58] <A3n> and iwconfig finds eth2 as a wireless interface with the correct ssid
[01:58] <nothlit> DARKGuy, I think I'm out of ideas
[01:58] <Vorbote> reverseblade: Linux multi-user servers will rule ;-)
[01:58] <A3n> yup
[01:58] <javaJake> A3n, say what? eth2 as a wireless device, with correct ssid?...
[01:58] <DARKGuy> nothlit: so am I :( I'm changing ports to see if I have any luck
[01:58] <javaJake> A3n, I'm not following there...
[01:58] <reverseblade> Vorbote, I meant about the availability of ACL by default ?
[01:58] <nothlit> DARKGuy, after you change the config sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart
[01:59] <reverseblade> Vorbote, I am just curious, if we could see ACL as the de facto standard
[01:59] <DARKGuy> nothlit: just did, try please? http://darkguy.no-ip.org:300/
[01:59] <A3n> javaJake:iwlist eth2 (my wireless) scan cant find my access point
[01:59] <javaJake> A3n, are you saying eth2 is seeing your wireless network?
[01:59] <A3n> http://prism54.org/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=4428
[01:59] <A3n> like this
[01:59] <nothlit> DARKGuy, not working
[01:59] <DARKGuy> nothlit: dangit :/
[01:59] <A3n> apperantly, but it cant find my AP for some reason
[01:59] <Airwulf> hello to you all
[01:59] <DARKGuy> hi Airwulf
[02:00] <Airwulf> Can I modify the context menu of gnome desktop?
[02:00] <abes> Hey I have a problem: I have a laptop with an audio output in the front (3.5mm jack). When I plug the headphones in they work, indeed, but the main speakers are still on which kind of beats the purpose of the headphones... Any ideas?
[02:00] <javaJake> A3n, ok, it seems like they're making an AP using their card.
[02:00] <Vorbote> reverseblade: that's always a prerogative of the sysadmin. If you like me, are a BOfH or former one, you will enabled them first thing in the list. But to enable them by efault? Hmm... I think the traditional POSIX scheme works well enough, unless you have to interoperate with SMB/CIFS filesystems (namely WinNT/Samba).
[02:00] <javaJake> A3n, and they can see other APs.
[02:00] <javaJake> A3n, which tells me their cards are working, mostly.
[02:01] <javaJake> A3n, now, in your case, your card doesn't seem to work at all.
[02:01] <reverseblade> Vorbote, I got it, thanks
[02:01] <javaJake> A3n, and they use the kernel modules, not ndiswrapper.
[02:01] <nothlit> DARKGuy, I just tried in 6 browsers, nada, but the route to you is clear with ping, so its definitely an apache problem
[02:01] <Vorbote> reverseblade: your welcome
[02:01] <javaJake> A3n, maybe there's a driver conflict... do you know what the driver for your card is in the kernel?
[02:02] <A3n> javaJake: i dont know
[02:02] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Ah, thanks for the info :) definitely it's an apache problem, but it's kind of hard to try to solve since google doesn't help at all >.< and all apache stuff I search for linux end up with LAMP installations with webserver stuff already installed and don't tell how to install it in a non-server setup
[02:02] <A3n> javaJake: i know i installed the driver correctly with ndiswrapper 1.23 with the correct howto from http://prism54.org/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=4428
[02:02] <javaJake> A3n, wrong link. :P
[02:03] <A3n> oops right
[02:03] <A3n> http://prism54.org/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=4428

[02:03] <javaJake> Ah, right

[02:03] <abes> Hey I have a problem: I have a laptop with an audio output in the front (3.5mm jack). When I plug the headphones in they work, indeed, but the main speakers are still on which kind of beats the purpose of the headphones... Any ideas?
[02:04] <alecjw> im trying to use twinview but only one of my mo0nitors works, can someone help me please?
[02:04] <alecjw> *work
[02:04] <javaJake> A3n, OK, so ndiswrapper itself is installed OK.
[02:04] <A3n> javaJake: http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Installation#Configure_interface is where i have the problem
[02:04] <nothlit> DARKGuy, did you follow the server install in help.ubuntu.com/community ?
[02:04] <javaJake> A3n, goto System -> Administration -> Device Manager.
[02:04] <nothlit> DARKGuy, it'll work fine from an ubuntu-desktop install
[02:04] <javaJake> A3n, locate your card, and tell me what the model is.
[02:05] <DARKGuy> nothlit: lemme check
[02:05] <javaJake> A3n, I need something solid to google with so I can find out what kernel module might be conflicting...
[02:05] <A3n> well i'm dual booting ubuntu / windows and i'm on windows atm
[02:05] <javaJake> A3n, oh... ok....
[02:05] <javaJake> A3n, well, device manager in windows works. :)
[02:05] <javaJake> A3n, just tell me exactly what it says.
[02:05] <alecjw> here's my xorg.conf: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35172/
[02:06] <abes> Anybody?
[02:06] <alecjw> both of them onitors are exactly the smae, except oned digital (DFP) and one's analogue (CRT)
[02:06] <fuffe> I'm running Nvidia Gforce 5500FX and 3D games runned much faster on windows than on linux.
[02:06] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Yes, I followed a similar one
[02:06] <nothlit> Same vertical/horizontal scan/refresh rate?
[02:06] <A3n> "Sitecom Wireless PCI Card 54Mbps WL-121v2 ?
[02:07] <DARKGuy> nothlit: this one has some editing stuff that the ones I followed didn't had, maybe I'll try this to check
[02:07] <javaJake> alecjw, Xorg.0.log will help you get more help.
[02:07] <javaJake> A3n, excellent! That's what your card is...
[02:07] <nothlit> DARKGuy, lol I'm sorry then, the server install worked fine for me from ubuntu-desktop on a diff system
[02:07] <alecjw> javaJake: will that be in the smae dir?
[02:07] <alecjw> nothlit: were you talking to me? if you were, yes.
[02:07] <javaJake> alecjw, no, /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[02:07] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Well, it doesn't hurt to try this one from the start, again :P
[02:07] <A3n> yea but in ubuntu it shows up as Intersil ISL Prism Javelin/Xbow
[02:08] <eilker> what is alternate cd?
[02:08] <javaJake> A3n, well then Ubuntu's plain wrong.
[02:08] <javaJake> A3n, I think
[02:08] <nothlit> alecjw, i was and oh
[02:08] <abes> Hello! I have a problem: I have a laptop with an audio output in the front (3.5mm jack). When I plug the headphones in they work, indeed, but the main speakers are still on which kind of beats the purpose of the headphones... Any ideas?
[02:08] <A3n> but ndiswrapper said "driver present, hardware present"
[02:08] <praveer_fedora> is it possible that ubuntu 6.06 install doesnt ask for root password and authentication fails while accessing root account?
[02:08] <A3n> so i supose it uses that chipset
[02:09] <Huibert> praveer_fedora: yes, the root account is sort off disabled in ubuntu
[02:09] <nothlit> praveer_fedora, ubuntu never asks for root passwd, its sudo based
[02:09] <Huibert> !sudo
[02:09] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[02:09] <praveer_fedora> ok
[02:09] <alecjw> javaJake: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35173/
[02:09] <A3n> javaJake: so maybe a problem between prism00 driver and "wireless tools for linux"
[02:11] <alecjw> nothlit, javaJake: both of them are actually the smae monitor, but it has an anlogue and digital input and my gpu has an analogue and digital output.
[02:11] <javaJake> A3n, yea... it's a matter of figuring out what the module's called, and unloading it. Tell you what, next time you are in Linux run "lsmod | grep prism". That'll show any prism information.
[02:11] <DARKGuy> nothlit: w00t, I think I -kinda- did it
[02:11] <daniel32> where can i download the grub for dos?
[02:11] <A3n> javaJake: k i"ll try that
[02:12] <javaJake> alecjw, "(WW) NVIDIA(0): TwinView requested, but only 1 display devices found."
[02:12] <nothlit> DARKGuy, thats great :)
[02:12] <javaJake> A3n, that should list any currently loaded prism modules.
[02:12] <alecjw> javaJake: but i have 2.... (well, one with both inputs plugged in). what shall i do?
[02:12] <javaJake> A3n, I won't be on long, so here's my e-mail: fun 2 program 8 AT yahoo d.i.t com
[02:12] <daniel32> i'm trying to reinstall my windows.
[02:12] <DARKGuy> nothlit: :) now it says access denied (I'm trying with a web proxy) but that means I'll just have to edit folder permissions no?
[02:13] <javaJake> alecjw, you didn't correctly configure twinview, it looks like. Check your configuration and be sure you configured it correctly.
[02:13] <A3n> k
[02:13] <nothlit> DARKGuy,  The access denied is probably the proxy denying you
[02:13] <daniel32> quit
[02:13] <dou213> hey, i have vmware server and receive an error when trying to power on FreeBSD: "Could not CreateProcess: Failed to logon to specified account for VM"
[02:13] <javaJake> alecjw, mainly check to be sure the two monitors are properly punched into twinview.

[02:14] <A3n> thats what showed up on lspci -n
[02:14] <alecjw> javaJake: sorry, im a complete n00b at dual monitors in xorg, how do i do that?
[02:14] <javaJake> A3n, alright, thanks... more stuff to google. :)
[02:15] <nothlit> DARKGuy, nope, and lol I tried when you said you did it
[02:15] <javaJake> alecjw, ah, ok, that explains this a little. :P

[02:20] <ernz> Hello
[02:20] <[Wiebel] > Hi again,
[02:20] <ernz> Can someone please tell me why my new Edgy installation has an extra Floppy 1 drive that doesn't physically exist?
[02:20] <DARKGuy> nothlit: IT WORKS!!!!!!
[02:20] <A[D] minS> hello what is package like prozilla under ubuntu ?
[02:20] <[Wiebel] > is there a nice howto some where to make a nice netboot ubuntu distro
[02:20] <[Wiebel] > only howto's I can find are for install systems
[02:20] <DARKGuy> nothlit: http://darkguy.no-ip.org:300/~dragon/ what about this >:D?
[02:21] <javaJake> alecjw, check this out: "the "ConnectedMonitor" option overrides what display devices are actually detected, while the "UseDisplayDevice" option controls which of the detected display devices will be used on this X screen."
[02:21] <[Wiebel] > But I need a full grown ubuntu kernel with netboot support
[02:21] <nothlit> DARKGuy, try running this server and see if it works http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html
[02:21] <javaJake> alecjw, so I'd comment out those two options (by placing a "#" in front of them) and try again.
[02:21] <DARKGuy> nothlit: oki o.o;
[02:21] <A[D] minS> i want to install download manager like download accelerator ? is there something like it under edgy ?
[02:21] <javaJake> alecjw, since the drivers should take care of that by itself.
[02:21] <alecjw> javaJake: thanks, i'll try that
[02:21] <javaJake> A[D] minS, you use Firefox?
[02:21] <nothlit> DARKGuy, also its a dev server if you run it permanently you need to follow the security stuff there
[02:22] <DARKGuy> nothlit: alright, I'll try :)
[02:22] <javaJake> A[D] minS, 'cause DownThemAll(.net) is an awesome download manager that really really does a great job.
[02:22] <nothlit> DARKGuy, nothing from ~dragon either
[02:22] <DARKGuy> nothlit: and, false alarm on that x_x
[02:22] <DARKGuy> nothlit: yeah ):
[02:22] <javaJake> A[D] minS, but it is a plugin for firefox.
[02:22] <DARKGuy> nothlit: gonna try that one now
[02:22] <Zaggynl> argl

[02:22] <alecjw> javaJake: ok - i'm restarting x now. wish me luck!
[02:23] <eilker> what is alternate cd ? what is it for ?
[02:23] <javaJake> *Sigh*
[02:23] <nothlit> DARKGuy, kk
[02:23] <Aldoliel> eilker, Server and text-mode installs
[02:24] <javaJake> eilker, for systems that have less then 192 MB RAM, or Gnome isn't working, or other special needs.
[02:24] <javaJake> eilker, like a server install.
[02:24] <eilker> aldoliel: we have server cd too, what is difference between them ?
[02:24] <javaJake> !server
[02:24] <ubotu> Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current stable version is 6.06 LTS. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/
[02:24] <nothlit> eilker, alternate cd is a non graphical cd for setting up things like grub/lvm/raid and you use it for basic installs more customised installs and when the desktop live cd doesn't work (it doesn't use the X server, so there are less things to go wrong
[02:25] <nothlit> javaJake, no the server disc is different from the alternate disc
[02:25] <javaJake> Hmm... well, if you are going for a server install, that's the way to go.
[02:25] <javaJake> nothlit, ok
[02:25] <alecjw> javaJake: i've got a message to send you, but its a bit to big to put here, i'll patebin it.
[02:25] <javaJake> OK
[02:25] <storkme> how do i automatically mount a windows share at startup?
=== knix_ is now known as knix
[02:25] <eilker> nothlit: we have ubuntu, kubuntu,xubuntu,edubuntu, alternate cd , and server cd ? right ?
[02:25] <javaJake> Aldoliel, eilker, never mind - the alternate cd doesn't do server installations now.
[02:25] <nothlit> Stork, a windows share or a windows drive?
[02:25] <javaJake> eilker, yes...
[02:25] <frogzoo> !ntfs | storkme
[02:25] <ubotu> storkme: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[02:25] <A[D] minS> javaJake: i want to download files using more than 3 connection @ same time to finish it quickly ..but firefox will download using 1 connection..thats why i am looking for download manager to download 4 pers
[02:26] <DARKGuy> A[D] minS: d4x (Downloader for X)
[02:26] <nothlit> Stork, if its a drive ubuntu-guide.org if its a share you need smbfs and then you have to pass login options or guest,uid/guid=#### in fstab
[02:26] <javaJake> A[D] minS, right, DownThemAll makes 4-5 connections to the server.
[02:26] <Aldoliel> A[D] minS, Can you not change that in Firefox's about:config?
[02:26] <eilker> server cd has a gui ?
[02:26] <frogzoo> A[D] minS: wget, but it's cli only
[02:26] <DARKGuy> A[D] minS: It's like FlashGet - or what javaJake told you

[02:27] <dv_> hmm
[02:27] <dv_> I want a distro called "intex2
[02:27] <dv_> "Intex2
[02:27] <dv_> argh
[02:27] <dv_> "Intex" :)
[02:27] <javaJake> alecjw, those options limit what monitors and cards X detects. By punching those in, you made one of your monitors not be detected. Removing them did the trick.
[02:27] <eilker> nothlit: i have kubuntu and installed lamp server, do i have same things with server cd installation now ? trying to understand difference between kubuntu desktop and server
[02:28] <dv_> like the computer system from the alien breed series
[02:28] <alecjw> javaJake: oh right. thanks
[02:28] <javaJake> alecjw, np.
[02:28] <javaJake> Got to dash, everyone. Tata
[02:28] <warkruid> \quit
[02:28] <javaJake> lol
[02:29] <nothlit> eilker, no ubuntu server cd doesn't have a gui , you actually have more things :)
[02:29] <nothlit> eilker, also i don't know if there is any difference between kubuntu server cd and ubuntu server cd
[02:29] <nothlit> but probably not
[02:30] <eilker> nothlit: i think there is no kubuntu server cd...
[02:30] <nothlit> ahh k
[02:30] <eilker> nothlit: just ubuntu server cd
[02:30] <eilker> nothlit: because no kde no gnome
[02:31] <Donald1> hello, i would like to know why each time i try open Azureus, it opens for a few seconds then just shuts down...

[02:31] <nothlit> Yeah but I thought mabbe they double named it so ppl would know they could d/l a server install even if they like kubuntu and i remember there are a lot of d/l options
[02:31] <DARKGuy> Donald1: try running "azureus" from a terminal and tell us what does it says?
[02:32] <nothlit> DARKGuy, hows your server stuff going
[02:32] <DARKGuy> nothlit: downloading still, 30/50Mb ;)
[02:32] <Donald1> DARKGuy: i'm new to all this, and i'm trying to learn how to use the teminal, how do i launch it from the terminal?
[02:33] <DARKGuy> Donald1: Ah, you just open a terminal window and type "azureus" then press enter, just like that :P
[02:33] <nothlit> Donald1, Applications -> Accessories -> Gnome Terminal              type in azureus and hit enter
[02:33] <Donald1> lol ok
[02:33] <DARKGuy> Donald1: the terminal is where nothlit told you :P
[02:33] <Donald1> :p
[02:33] <Donald1> Darkguy: it says # An error report file has been saved as hs_err_pid11823.log.
[02:33] <Donald1> # Please refer to the file for further information.
[02:34] <stoorty> how do i know if i have edgy or dapper?
[02:34] <nothlit> DARKGuy, just check the security readme
[02:34] <frogzoo> stoorty: lsb_release -a
[02:35] <stoorty> thanks frogzoo
[02:35] <DARKGuy> Donald1: Hm, I dunno where is that logfile, I thought it'd throw some stuff in the terminal :/
[02:36] <DARKGuy> Donald1: if you type "ls" then press enter, does that file shows up?
[02:36] <DarkED> Anybody have any clue why Ubuntu freezes when I pull my EVDO card out of the CardBus slot?
[02:36] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Sure will, thanks :)
[02:36] <Donald1> DARKGuy: let me check
=== xipietotec is now known as EmmaneulGoldstei
[02:36] <dou213> hey, i have vmware server and receive an error when trying to power on FreeBSD: "Could not CreateProcess: Failed to logon to specified account for VM"
[02:36] <nothlit> DARKGuy, go look in ~/.azureus
=== EmmaneulGoldstei is now known as EmanuelGoldstein
[02:36] <nothlit> you might have to go into a log folder in there
[02:37] <nothlit> DARKGuy, sry i mean donald

[02:37] <nothlit> Donald1, you might have too look in ~/.azureus or ~/.azureus/log(s)
[02:37] <nothlit> Donald1, i know
[02:37] <rvalles> trying to compile qemu according to the guide in the wiki
[02:37] <rvalles> what am I missing?
[02:37] <Donald1> nothlit: ok
[02:38] <nothlit> rvalles, qemu or kqemu?
[02:38] <rvalles> nothlit: both.
[02:38] <Zaggynl> I'm trying to bind my keypad substract key to a 'run_command_#', anyone knows howto?
[02:38] <josh_> anyone in here have experience with rainbow tables?
[02:38] <rvalles> nothlit: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KQEmu
[02:38] <nothlit> rvalles, you'll need linux header files and build-essential
[02:38] <rvalles> nothlit: this "compiling from source" thing.
[02:38] <nothlit> rvalles, i have them both installed
[02:38] <nothlit> rvalles, i dont think you need to compile qemu
[02:38] <rvalles> nothlit: I shouldn't need special headers (the kernel is a 2.6.19 I built myself).
[02:38] <josh_> rainbow tables?
[02:39] <nothlit> rvalles, go to kqemus site it'll tell you what to do
[02:39] <Donald1> nothlit: what do I do?
[02:39] <rvalles> nothlit: I need to; I want kqemu.
[02:39] <nothlit> rvalles, I'm running the qemu (ubuntu) binary and the kqemu module
[02:39] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: system -> gconf editor  & look for the key binding under metacity
[02:40] <rvalles> nothlit: interesting.
[02:40] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, I'm trying to find out what the right Key is
[02:40] <nothlit> rvalles, also later on you have to remember to chmod qemu or change the startup scripts to do so
[02:40] <Zaggynl> <KP_Add> or <KP_Substract> do not work
[02:40] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: xev
[02:40] <noelferreira> firefox won't start. any help?
[02:40] <Donald1> nothlit: i tryied launching azureus again, and when it shut down, it said in the terminal: Aborted (core dumped)
[02:40] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, that only gives me a keycode
[02:40] <Zaggynl> which doesn't work either
[02:40] <Zaggynl> 'state 0x10, keycode 82 (keysym 0x0, NoSymbol), same_screen YES,'
[02:40] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: xmodmap ?

[02:41] <Zaggynl> ?

[02:42] <Xteven> how can I change the refresh rate in ubuntu ?
[02:42] <Donald1> nothlit: lol sorry^^
[02:42] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: tried KP_Subtract ?
[02:42] <Xteven> I can select a resolution, but not a refresh rate
[02:42] <DARKGuy> nothlit: w00t, I just installed it :3
[02:43] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, I think so, but I'll retry that
[02:43] <noelferreira> any help? firefox and thunderbird won't start.
[02:43] <nothlit> DARKGuy, ok run it and i'll try to access it
[02:43] <woro2006_> hey
[02:43] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, nope :(
[02:43] <woro2006_> anybody got dovecot + postfix set up?
[02:43] <DARKGuy> nothlit: just did, please try ^^
[02:43] <woro2006_> i need the configuration file
[02:43] <nothlit> DARKGuy, make sure your other servers aren't conflicting with the ports
[02:43] <woro2006_> it doesn't seem like dovcot is reading in the users/password file
[02:44] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: xmodmap -kp will show the mapping from scancode to x's keycodes
[02:44] <Zaggynl> ah sweet
[02:44] <DARKGuy> nothlit: what do you mean exactly, like, what servers? mysql and such?
[02:44] <nothlit> DARKGuy, i'm not getting anything
[02:44] <nothlit> DARKGuy, yeah
[02:44] <nothlit> DARKGuy, are you getting anything from it?
[02:45] <DARKGuy> nothlit: I'm at localhost reading the security stuff and such
[02:45] <nothlit> It sounds like maybe your windows install did something with UPnP to automatically route the server to your comp that ubuntu isn't doing
[02:46] <nothlit> DARKGuy, it might not be apache then
[02:46] <Donald1> nothlit: it doesnt find .azureus anywhere, i checked with the search app in every directory, and it doesnt find it :s
[02:47] <alecjw> hi, how do i set my primary monitor in twinview?
[02:47] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, lots of keys in there, but kp_subtract and kp_add aren't in the list
[02:47] <Dreamglider> i just have to reinstall ubuntu i guess. and install windows aswell so i can watch a movie and be wireless... later.
[02:47] <nothlit> Donald1, its a hidden directory at the base of a users home folder
[02:48] <Donald1> nothlit: so how do i access it?
[02:48] <DARKGuy> nothlit: it's so weird, how can other programs like VNC work? :/
[02:48] <nothlit> DARKGuy, rofl, absolutely no idea, i'm flabbergasted
[02:48] <DARKGuy> nothlit: it's so messed up xD...
[02:48] <humbolt> would feisty kernel run in edgy?
[02:49] <alecjw> can anone help me?
[02:49] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Oh well, this might give something else to play for a while and see if there can be something done for it, big thanks though :)
[02:49] <noelferreira> hi people any help please. firefos won't start
[02:49] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: not even KP_Subtract ?
[02:49] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, nope
[02:49] <hastesaver> Hi, changing the volume doesn't seem to be working. Is this a known/common bug?
[02:49] <Zaggynl> actually, the whole keycode isn't bound at all
[02:49] <nothlit> DARKGuy, start your vnc server, lemme see if i can connect to it, (not login or anything just see if i can access it)
[02:49] <nothlit> DARKGuy, i just wanna make sure
[02:49] <DARKGuy> nothlit: Oki, gimme a sec
[02:50] <xevil> Donald1: this might help you...  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-25852.html
[02:50] <nothlit> Zaggynl, why don't you use a utility like xbindkeys or bbkeys instead
[02:50] <humbolt> I mean, are there any critical differences in the kernel API between edgy and feisty kernel? something like hotplug being replaced by udev?
[02:51] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: I think you can create a .xmodrc to map the key setting, not speaking from experience
[02:51] <Zaggynl> nothlit, I'll give those a try, thanks
[02:51] <hastesaver> To be precise, the volume bar in gnome-panel (as well as what responds when I use my keyboard's volume changing keys (what are they called?)) are both set to Master, which seems to have no effect. Can I change them to PCM or something?
[02:51] <Xteven> hello ?
[02:52] <Zaggynl> 'lo
[02:52] <Xteven> hi
[02:52] <profoX> does ubuntu 6.06 support all kinds of scsi devices?
[02:52] <frogzoo> hastesaver: right click -> preferences
[02:52] <dbe> In which directory should I put CVS files?
[02:52] <Xteven> can you tell me how I can select a refresh rate for a specific resolution ? I was able to do this in dapper, but not in edgy ?
[02:52] <fuci> Can someone help me? I've installed Nvidia drivers (twice, apparently..) and tried to remove them, did that and installed and enabled the drivers in my xorg.conf. I boot up GDM and I get error from Xorg that the Nvidia drivers in use are different version than something somewhere. Please help me.
[02:53] <frogzoo> profoX: worst case as long as the card has a linux driver - you compile/install the driver from source
[02:54] <AcidUK> Hi, i'm in a bit of a pickle. The nvidia drivers dont seem to support tvout properly, as the same config that works for vesa just shows a grey screen for them. This wouldnt be a problem but its a mythtv box, and I kinda need the video acceleration. Any suggestions?
[02:54] <iwkse> have you heard about RG?? http://www.windowscrash.com/albums/movies/windows_rg.swf
[02:54] <profoX> frogzoo: okay but most scsi drives should work out of the box?
[02:54] <czr> how to detect whether a system is ubuntu/kubuntu/xubuntu, and where to get the release name? any ideas? (in a script)
[02:55] <noelferreira> people
[02:55] <noelferreira> anyone knows why firefox won't start in edgy?
[02:55] <frogzoo> profoX: nope - only if there's a driver for the scsi card - you best check before you get the scsi card
[02:55] <m3m0r3xXx> m3m
[02:55] <vincent_wang> after I reinstalled windows xp, I can not install grub into MBR(getting Error 12 al the time), anyone can help?
[02:55] <m3m0r3xXx> ops :D
[02:55] <hastesaver> frogzoo, thanks, that takes care of the volume bar (or whatever it's called) in the panel. Do you know what to do with my keyboard's buttons?

[02:56] <fuci> Can someone help me? I've installed Nvidia drivers (twice, apparently..) and tried to remove them, did that and installed and enabled the drivers in my xorg.conf. I boot up GDM and I get error from Xorg that the Nvidia drivers in use are different version than something somewhere. Please help me.
[02:56] <profoX> frogzoo: its for a friend of mine so i don't know what scsi drive he has..
[02:56] <Aldoliel> Oh, sorry
[02:56] <czr> Vorbote, thanks, just what I needed :-)
[02:56] <frogzoo> hastesaver: sounds like you want to change the keybindings for metacity - go to system -> gconf editor & look under metacity
[02:56] <noelferreira> firefox won't start. no output from terminal. any help?
[02:56] <czr> since when has /etc/lsb-release existed, any ideas Vorbote?
[02:57] <frogzoo> profoX: well finding make & model is step #1
[02:57] <frogzoo> profoX: the drive isn't the problem, the scsi controller though is
[02:57] <Vorbote> czr: since ubuntu applied for LSB certification. Since Hoary I think
[02:57] <czr> Vorbote, cool, you're a star
[02:58] <stefg> noelferreira: Try a fresh profile. run 'firefox --profilemanager' from a term and create a new profile, then start firefox with it.
[02:58] <profoX> frogzoo: ok i'll ask him.. anyway to check what kind of scsi controller it is in win xp or the bios ?
[02:58] <frogzoo> profoX: in XP it will be under device manager
[02:58] <Vorbote> czr: do note that it may be even warty... Debian has got lsb config files for a long time.
[02:58] <profoX> frogzoo: thanks.. i'll ask him
[02:59] <hastesaver> frogzoo, ugh. gconf-editor is awful. I can't find it there :-(
[02:59] <noelferreira> stefg: nothing happens process goes to sleep
[02:59] <dbe> Is it safe to run CVS as root?
[02:59] <czr> Vorbote, good to know. I'll check for the existance first then
[02:59] <czr> writing a small tool to collect hw-data relevant for I/O benchmarking
[03:00] <czr> and getting the distroname/release would be nice (now it shows debian for ubuntu)
[03:00] <stefg> noelferreira: then something serious might be broken... i'd try 'sudo aptitude install --reinstall firefox' next
[03:00] <frogzoo> hastesaver: my bad - try prefs -> keyboard shortcuts
[03:00] <noelferreira> nothing stefg i tried it before
[03:01] <noelferreira> i guess it is even more serious
=== aceZ is now known as acez
[03:01] <noelferreira> i can't run thunderbird as well stefg
[03:02] <stefg> noelferreira: then tar and zip  your .mozilla* directories and delete the originals in your homedir.
[03:02] <noelferreira> i tried it also stefg
[03:02] <fuci> Can someone help me? I've installed Nvidia drivers (twice, apparently..) and tried to remove them, did that and installed and enabled the drivers in my xorg.conf.

[03:03] <gladi2k> I can not change the screen resolution
[03:03] <gladi2k> I tried to edit the xorg.conf and so on but it still doesn't work
[03:03] <dreamer> DARKGuy: use /msg user -text-
[03:03] <stefg> noelferreira: hmmm, then i run out of ideas.. would be worth finding out if it's bad user settings, or if the files in /usr/lib/firefox  are broken
[03:03] <DARKGuy> dreamer: thanks :)
[03:04] <gladi2k> can anybody help me?
[03:04] <Zaggynl> ugh, a reboot of X is all that was needed ><
[03:04] <alecjw> ive just got twinview working, but it's treating my CRT as my primart monitor rather than my DFP, does anyone know how to fix this?
[03:04] <frogzoo> gladi2k: after you edit xorg.conf, you must restart x
[03:04] <Zaggynl> the standard hotkey app of gnome messes up all the keybindings
[03:05] <Arin> hello, anyone could give a hint why kaffeine shows blue screen when playing movies?
[03:05] <mtx> can someone help to install cinelerra please?
[03:05] <Arin> i googled about it and found two reasons
[03:05] <Arin> either video card or codecs
[03:05] <Arin> like kaffeine can not see codecs
[03:06] <gladi2k> yes okay but I'm still having problems
[03:06] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: file a bug
[03:06] <hastesaver> frogzoo, no, I don't see anything there that would help me. Basically, the keyboard volume buttons are already working, but they act on Master, not on PCM. How do I change this?
[03:06] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, It's alread reported =)
[03:06] <gladi2k> when I go to system -> screen resolution. I get only 1280x768 displayed
[03:06] <Arin> anyone with a clue what for to google about to get this straight ?
[03:06] <gladi2k> and it should be 1280x1024 and that's what I entered
[03:06] <stefg> mtx: you might have better luck to join a #cinelerra channel if there is one (which i don't know)
[03:07] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: cool
[03:07] <dreamer> that sucks .. try a lower refresh-rate for your menitor gladi2k
[03:07] <frogzoo> hastesaver: oh, no don't know how to do that
[03:07] <gladi2k> I tried 60hz and 75hz I think that's not the problem
[03:07] <storkme> how can i mount something as a regular user without putting it in /etc/fstab.. or furthermore how could i mount it as root but make it readable+writable by the normal user?
[03:08] <gladi2k> but why does it display in 1280x768? I didn't even enter that mode in xorg.conf
[03:08] <gladi2k> it says Modes		"1280x1024"
[03:08] <gladi2k> and nothing else. I deleted the rest
[03:08] <frogzoo> storkme: set the 'user' or 'users' option in fstab
[03:08] <storkme> frogzoo, i can't put it in fstab.. i said
[03:09] <gladi2k> and in front of the hz number there is a minus :(
[03:09] <frogzoo> storkme: why can't you put it in fstab? if you haven't got root access, you can't do this
[03:09] <Locutu5> Does anyone know about a bug with smbldap and chown on ubuntu server?
[03:09] <storkme> frogzoo, if i put it in fstab it crashes on logon
[03:10] <frogzoo> storkme: remove the 'auto' option, so it has to be manually mounted
[03:10] <Locutu5> I cant find anything about it with google or forums
[03:10] <Zaggynl> Anyone knows a way to lower the volume with rhytmbox with the terminal? Right now I can only set it to a certain amount with 'rhythmbox --set-volume 0.8', and I want to turn it down by a bit with every keypress
[03:11] <Donald1> Azureus starts up but shuts down a second after, when I start it with the terminal, I get a long error message
[03:11] <storkme> frogzoo, what do the <dump> and <pass> bits mean in /etc/fstab?
[03:12] <alecjw> ive just got twinview working, but it's treating my CRT as my primary monitor rather than my DFP, does anyone know how to fix this?
[03:12] <gladi2k> hey guys I need help!
[03:12] <romulo> hi, how i reinstall an already installed package?
[03:12] <Locutu5> we all do,
[03:12] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, wow, "--set-volume" doesn't work either for me. What are you using?
[03:12] <Stork> ok i will man fstab
[03:12] <Locutu5> apt-get reinstall
[03:13] <romulo> invalid operation reinstall
[03:13] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, rhythmbox in dapper
[03:13] <frogzoo> Stork: man fstab
[03:13] <Zaggynl> 'rhythmbox --set-volume 0.1' works fine here
[03:13] <renjith171> i installed firefox 2 in dapperdrake now how shud make it available in my panel or in d application menu
[03:13] <Zaggynl> I just want to turn it down by a step, not just set it
[03:14] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, and this feature was removed in edgy?!
[03:14] <Locutu5> romulo: aptitude reinstall
[03:14] <romulo> great thanks
[03:14] <romulo> =)
[03:14] <romulo> worked
[03:14] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, can you try 'rhythmbox --volume-down' for me?
[03:14] <Zaggynl> I see that popping up on google
[03:14] <Locutu5> wlcm
[03:14] <Zaggynl> doesn't work with my dapper version
[03:15] <Donald1> hey, i have a problem with azureus, when i launch it, it starts up correctly but shuts down the minute after, it's not a problem with Java as I reinstalled it...what should i do?
[03:15] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, you could set it once, write the set value to a file, and write a script which takes the current volume level from the file, calculate the new value to set, and set it
[03:15] <misc--> http://rafb.net/paste/results/AaZW7185.html if anyone wants to help - using ubuntu, postfix delivers to dspam which delivers back to postfix however I'm getting no header or signature information in the email being sent
[03:15] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, yeah I thought about that too, it's dirty though <:
[03:15] <gladi2k> no one can help me in here :(
[03:15] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, no it doesn't work for me. The default rhythmbox on edgy doesn't seem to have *any* features for manipulating an existing rhythmbox
[03:16] <Zaggynl> gladi2k, just ask the question in here :-)
[03:16] <hastesaver> GNOME seems to be all about taking away options and features.
[03:16] <Sotai> Is there a ubuntu utility that reconfigures your xorg.conf for you?
[03:16] <gladi2k> yeah the screen resolution is messed up
[03:16] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, what does 'rhythmbox --help' for you?
[03:16] <gladi2k> it says 1280x768
[03:16] <Sotai> I've managed to destroy mine
[03:16] <gladi2k> but I entered 1280x1024
[03:16] <Donald1>  hey, i have a problem with azureus, when i launch it, it starts up correctly but shuts down the minute after, it's not a problem with Java as I reinstalled it...what should i do?
[03:16] <nothlit> GNOME is designed for the nontechy that asks whether the trash can is real, prevents confusion
[03:16] <Locutu5> dpkg-reconfigure
[03:16] <starman_> hi
[03:17] <Zaggynl> gladi2k, check your xorg.conf with 'sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[03:17] <alecjw> ive just got twinview working, but it's treating my CRT as my primary monitor rather than my DFP, does anyone know how to fix this?
[03:17] <gladi2k> I checked it
[03:17] <stefg> Sotai: no.unfortunately not, but I'm looking for partners for my request to create one :-)
[03:17] <gladi2k> there is no 1280x768 entered!
[03:17] <Zaggynl> odd
[03:17] <gladi2k> where does Ubuntu get this strange resolution from?
[03:17] <noelferreira> why can't i run firefox? any help?

[03:18] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35177/
[03:18] <Zaggynl> hastesaver,  woot, thanks :D
[03:18] <Donald1>  hey, i have a problem with azureus, when i launch it, it starts up correctly but shuts down the minute after, it's not a problem with Java as I reinstalled it and I get a weird message in the terminal...what should i do?
[03:18] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, try ' -help-all '
[03:18] <Locutu5> to reconfigure your xorg use dpkg-reconfigure xorg
[03:19] <Zaggynl> Donald1, I'm not an Azureus person and use utorrent with wine, you gave that a try?
[03:19] <Sotai> stefg: Hehe, I normally use gentoo and I'm not that experienced in linux/mega-low-level programming =)
[03:19] <Donald1> Zaggynl: i'm really not familiar with wine, as i have absolutely no idea how it works :p
[03:20] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35178/
[03:20] <Zaggynl> Donald1, it's pretty easy actually, try installing it, then download utorrent.exe, browse to it's directory with the terminal and type 'wine utorrent.exe'
[03:21] <hastesaver> Donald1, search Synaptic for bittorrent for alternatives to Azureus :-)
[03:21] <gladi2k> damn nothing works!
[03:21] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, indeed, it doesn't appear to be there, or we're looking at the wrong section of the help
[03:21] <hastesaver> gladi2k, I assume you've already read http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto ?
[03:22] <starman_> I have noticed my system has same modules information in two different directories /etc/modprobe.d and /etc/modutils
[03:22] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, I guess this is a warning to never upgrade to Edgy :-)
[03:22] <Zaggynl> Well, since edgy is cutting edge/beta, I'll stick to stable dapper :)
[03:22] <gladi2k> hastesaver: yes, but I'll try to read it again
[03:22] <starman_> which modules are loaded in the boot the ones in modprobe.d or in modutils?
[03:23] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, no, edgy is Ubuntu's latest *stable* release (since October)
[03:23] <raghu206> does anyone help me regarding jdbc :)
[03:23] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, as they say :(
[03:24] <Zaggynl> but it doesn't have LTS support does it?
[03:24] <noelferreira> help please. firefox won't start. http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/2s7BaV68.html
[03:24] <alecjw> ive just got twinview working, but it's treating my CRT as my primary monitor rather than my DFP, does anyone know how to fix this?
[03:25] <starman_> the files blacklist in /etc/modprobe.d are loaded or are kept from being load?
[03:25] <hastesaver> Zaggynl, it will be supported for the usual 18 months, IIRC. (Dapper for 3 years.)
[03:25] <allah_the_Mercif> does anyone know a program to crack wep encryption
[03:25] <starman_> aircrack
[03:25] <nothlit> 5 years for server
[03:25] <allah_the_Mercif> my friend was telling me about one and said to check here
[03:25] <Zaggynl> hmm
[03:25] <allah_the_Mercif> is it in the repo's starman?
[03:25] <nothlit> i don't think ubuntu support encryption cracking
[03:25] <starman_> nope
[03:25] <starman_> not that I know
[03:25] <noelferreira> help please. firefox won't start. http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/2s7BaV68.html
[03:25] <Aldoliel> aircrack is in the repos
[03:26] <Zaggynl> allah_the_Mercif, kismet, cain & abel
[03:26] <Zaggynl> but the latter is for win32 afaik
[03:26] <starman_> however allah_the_Mercif
[03:26] <starman_> in my case I had to comment out some stuff in the wifi card driver
[03:26] <Mane> Hell together. Need help with my Intel Pro Wireless 2100. Private Message please
[03:26] <Donald1> Zaggynl: i installed wine and created a .wine directory, now i download utorrent from the website?
[03:26] <allah_the_Mercif> you guys know a site off hand for wifi cracking?
[03:27] <Zaggynl> Donald1, yeah
[03:27] <lazka> hi, does someone know a little bit python, i ve got a question about lists
[03:27] <starman_> I think the same one from aircrack
[03:27] <hastesaver> allah_the_Mercif, aircrack *is* in the repos, whatever it is
[03:27] <starman_> has a very interesting guide
[03:27] <Zaggynl> Donald1, apart from some minor quirks, utorrent works pretty well
[03:27] <starman_> I would visit it, it even tells you about interesting methods
[03:27] <noelferreira> firefox won't start . please i need help .   http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/2s7BaV68.html
[03:28] <allah_the_Mercif> k hastesaver thanks
[03:28] <AcidUK> I need to install an older version of the nvidia drivers, is that possible?
[03:28] <|thunder> yep
[03:28] <|thunder> there are lots of tutorials. especially for ubuntu
[03:29] <AcidUK> I meant is it possible using apt? I'd rather not use the nvidia installer
[03:29] <AcidUK> ok
[03:29] <allah_the_Mercif> is there a program that can give you an idea of where wifi hotspots are?
[03:29] <nothlit> utorrent works great
[03:29] <starman_> does anyone know if the blacklist files in /etc/modprobe.d have modules that are not to be loaded??
[03:29] <allah_the_Mercif> i have like seven networks in my neighborhood but all slightly out of reach
[03:29] <umer> i cannot able connect gaim
[03:29] <nothlit> the tray icon doesn't support transparency though, i recommend compiling alltray and using that instead
[03:29] <allah_the_Mercif> is ther ea program that can like make a map of hotspots or something
[03:29] <starman_> allah_the_Mercif, you can check if you can crack yours, which is not illegal
[03:29] <allah_the_Mercif> so i have a basic idea of which way to go
[03:30] <starman_> and learn about it and how to protect your network
[03:30] <|thunder> nothlit; you usewin32  utorrent with wine ?
[03:30] <Donald1> Zaggynl: now that torrent is downloaded, what do i do?
[03:30] <alecjw> ive just got twinview working, but it's treating my CRT as my primary monitor rather than my DFP, does anyone know how to fix this?
[03:30] <nothlit> |thunder, yeah
[03:30] <|thunder> nothlit; me too. works OK
[03:30] <nothlit> |thunder, you need a bash script for integration though
[03:30] <Zaggynl> Donald1, browse to the directory it is in with a terminal, and type 'wine utorrent.exe'
[03:30] <|thunder> nothlit; how so ?
[03:30] <nothlit> |thunder, its in the forums somewhere
[03:31] <Zaggynl> You have to manuall add torrents though
[03:31] <Zaggynl> *manually
[03:31] <nothlit> |thunder, loading of torrents from webbrowser/clicking :)
[03:31] <hastesaver_> Donald1, but I think it will be easier to install other Linux programs that are in the repos instead of Windows programs through wine.
[03:31] <|thunder> ahh
[03:31] <nothlit> Zaggynl, no you just use the bash script from the ubuntu forums :)
[03:31] <Zaggynl> hastesaver, meh, so far I haven't found anything as feature rich and light as utorrent
[03:31] <|thunder> nothlit; I use NetMeter and PokerStart regularly too. and photoshop7 in cxoffice.

[04:05] <dter> Donald1: you can try, make a backup: 'sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.listbackup'
[04:05] <senator^> fnf ok I will try that... thought that there something wrong with the harddrive... the cd disc worked on another computer... didnt expekt the cd-rom to be corrupted... will test it now
[04:05] <senator^> fnf thanks

[04:09] <senator^> haste ok :)
[04:09] <dyland> there is a version of ubuntu, that run in lowest computers is ubuntu lite
[04:10] <fnf> senator^: A big part of Ubuntu is GNOME, which requires a moderate configuration (CPU > 500 MHz, 192MB RAM) to run acceptably, but the server installation is fine in yours.
[04:10] <senator^> dyland ok thanks
[04:10] <dter> Donald1: paste your sources.list on pastecode.com and give me the link
[04:10] <dyland> :)
[04:10] <fer> ok ,just trying install ati drivers but i need to be on super user on console i have no idea how to swich to this mode
[04:10] <Donald1> dter: ok
[04:10] <jrib> !ati | fer
[04:10] <ubotu> fer: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

[04:10] <ubotu> fer: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:10] <Koos> I've configured X11 and the NVidia drivers to use twinspan, and now is my ubuntu very unstable... Does anyone know a solution?
[04:11] <senator^> dont you guys get tired of answering questions all the time? :)
[04:11] <fer> i mean how to swich
[04:11] <fer> when i on console
[04:11] <dreamer> Koos: I believe the nvidia-drivers are very unstable, don't use them
[04:11] <showtime> type su
[04:11] <fer> ok
[04:11] <fnf> senator^: 'cause we appreciate the developers.
[04:11] <Koos> dreamer: but how can I use twinspan without the drivers?

[04:11] <senator^> so do I... wish I had the knowledge to help
[04:11] <senator^> dont know much about linux
[04:12] <Koos> dreamer: nv?
[04:12] <dreamer> Koos: I don't know, what is twinspan ?
[04:12] <aeromix> how am I to start sshd on my computer??

[04:12] <Koos> dreamer: Euh.. using two monitors on your computer with one desktop...
[04:12] <dreamer> Koos: use as driver nv instead of nvidea
[04:12] <lostinc> If I want to add XFCE as a desktop to an Ubuntu install via synaptic what package/s do I need?
[04:12] <aeromix> jrib: I did. but I can't connect to it now...
[04:12] <jrib> lostinc: xubuntu-desktop
[04:12] <dreamer> ok, nv could work
[04:12] <dyland> I've bought a new computer with intel core 2 duo, but i cant install ubuntu edgy
[04:12] <fnf> senator^: I believe if you stick to the terminal, even in X, you'll surely become productive in a few weeks.
[04:13] <Koos> dreamer: can I safely remove the drivers?
[04:13] <dter> dyland: ...because?
[04:13] <aeromix> jrib: when I type ssh aeromix@10.0.0.1 I get no response
[04:13] <lostinc> Thank you.
[04:13] <dreamer> just edit your xorg.conf and replace nvidea with nv
[04:13] <Koos> dreamer: Really? :|
[04:13] <dreamer> them ctrl-alt-backspace
[04:13] <slop> i just installed dapper and now my 3d acceleration doesn't work....fglrxinfo is showing 'mesa' again....
[04:13] <senator^> fnf perhaps... I did use linux and bsd a few years ago but now I forgot most of it
[04:13] <slop> i mean edgy
[04:13] <slop> doh
[04:13] <dreamer> if it doesn't work replace nv with nvidea again
[04:13] <dreamer> Koos:  yup
[04:14] <fer> Password:
[04:14] <fer> su: Authentication failure
[04:14] <fer> Disculpe.
[04:14] <fer> fer@fer:~$
[04:14] <slop> and i didn't just install...i upgraded
[04:14] <fnf> senator^: So you got the base already :) Then man is your friend.
[04:14] <aeromix> jrib: I installed openssh-server. But it seems like it is not enabled?
[04:14] <Koos> dreamer: i can create a backup-file :)
[04:14] <fer> that's i am geting
[04:14] <fer> and i am presty sure thats is the pass
[04:14] <Koos> dreamer: thanks, let's give it a try :)
[04:14] <dreamer> Koos: nv should be alot more stable than nvidea, the nvidea-drivers make my X crash everytime after 2 hours af running :/
[04:14] <Kayiin> Doesn't su have null for a password by default?
[04:14] <Kayiin> And only sudo is enabled?
[04:15] <dreamer> Koos: sure, but it's not a big change, easy enough to change from the console
[04:15] <Koos> dreamer: Yup... especially when scrolling or using windows on monitor 2 =\
[04:15] <dreamer> I've never used 2 monitors on a linux-setup
[04:15] <Koos> dreamer: I love it :)
[04:15] <dreamer> try nv and see if it werks :)

[04:15] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild

[04:15] <Koos> thanks :)
[04:15] <nothlit> Kayiin, su works fine, sudo su :P
[04:15] <dreamer> Koos: I have 2 monitors, but 2 different pc's :P
[04:16] <senator^> fnf hehe well when I used it was back in the time when windows was 95 or something like that... I got tired of windows... but XP is pretty ok. but now I did see ubuntu and it seemed so userfriendly that anyone could figure it out... so I wanted to try it
[04:16] <cwillu> I don't suppose there's a 2.6.18 kernel available for ubuntu prepackaged, is there?
[04:16] <dyland> 4dter i put the cd, and it starts to boot, but nothing, show a message like this: cant open tty, the job is closed
[04:16] <jrib> aeromix: does 'ssh localhost' work?
[04:16] <nothlit> Kayiin, thats not recommended of course, sudo -i  or sudo -s if you want to keep environment variables like $HOME and whatnot
[04:16] <showtime> ssh 127,0,0,1 works
[04:16] <Kayiin> Well, yeah.
[04:16] <Koos> dreamer: i've 2 pc's and one desktop... one is enough for me :P
[04:16] <dyland> sorry for my english
[04:16] <dyland> :)
[04:16] <Tailsfan> Does Ubuntu 6.10 include alsa and alsaconf installed already?
[04:16] <aeromix> jrib: yes
[04:17] <Koos> dreamer: I mean 2 servers ;)
[04:17] <devilsadvocate_> Tailsfan, yes
[04:17] <jrib> aeromix: then ssh is working.  Maybe you have a firewall?
[04:17] <Kayiin> Besides, if you need su for a while, you can just use sudo and you can sudo for the rest of that session without authentication.
[04:17] <aeromix> jrib: the problem is in the address probably. ping 10.0.0.1 isn't working as well...
[04:17] <Tailsfan> OK
[04:17] <fnf> senator^: Goodluck experimenting Ubuntu :) I'm sure if you got compatible hardware and good specs, it'll be really hard to comeback to Windoze. Beryl beats Vista's Areo horribly.
[04:17] <aeromix> jrib: but internet sharing works, I am now on laptop which is connected to desktop (10.0.0.1)
[04:18] <Koos> dreamer: do I need to install the drivers first?
[04:18] <dreamer> Koos: they should be installed default
[04:18] <dreamer> wait
[04:18] <showtime> when i look videos they are very slow in full scree does someone know why?

[04:18] <aeromix> jrib: do I need to allow ssh in firestarter? or sth like that?
[04:19] <jrib> aeromix: yeah, port 22
[04:19] <showtime> when i look videos they are very slow in full scree does someone know why?

[04:19] <yanger> wow, all i notice is that re-drawing text takes along time now ;\
[04:19] <Donald1> dter: is there any problem?
[04:19] <aeromix> jrib: how can I do it?
[04:19] <senator^> fnf well I prefer bsd before linux, but this is for a friend that doesnt know much about computers so I thought I try to install ubuntu on hers computer... for my own personal use I need windows since there are alot of musicprograms for windows that are not for *nix and thats what I do for a living
[04:19] <showtime> when i look videos they are very slow in full scree does someone know why?
[04:19] <dter> Donald1: sorry?
[04:19] <jrib> aeromix: it's pretty straightforward, just run firestarter and allow connections to port 22
[04:20] <Donald1> dter: i PM-ed you the pastecode URL

[04:29] <Donald1> dter: done
[04:29] <senator^> devilsadvocate however this ubuntu installtion is for a friend of mine that needs a simple to use operating system not for me, and I saw that ubuntu was pretty easy to understand so I thought that would be perfect for her since I got the impression it was realted to debian that is the best linux dist I heard
[04:29] <dter> Donald1: show me what you did
=== dter is now known as davin^afk

[04:30] <Donald1> http://www.pastecode.com/9285
[04:30] <devilsadvocate> senator^, then ubunutlite is NOT for that kind of use. It has all of the fat sliced off, and its built for efficiency instead of ease of use
[04:31] <EkUmBa> hello there
[04:31] <stepanstas> jrib, as far as i could tell, that post offers no solution, people are still having the problem.
[04:31] <devilsadvocate> senator^, best best would be ubuntu or kubuntu itself unless the hardware is _very_ old
[04:31] <spx2> hello all
[04:31] <davin^afk> Donald1: line 23, delete that space at the beginning
[04:31] <EkUmBa> does anyone know,how to download a flash movie from a page?
[04:31] <senator^> devilsadvocate ok I see...
[04:31] <davin^afk> Donald1: wait ill fix it
[04:31] <nothlit> fuffe oh, then you'll have to consult the gpl site or something
[04:31] <jrib> stepanstas: there are two solutions there, one is to make sure you are using 24bit depth, the other is to set some environment variable
[04:31] <Donald1> davin^afk: ok, that's nice of you
[04:31] <jrib> stepanstas: let me know if you can't find it, I'll take a look
[04:32] <davin^afk> Donald1: http://www.pastecode.com/9286
[04:32] <davin^afk> afk
[04:32] <senator^> devilsadvocate well thats the problem, its a 200mhz computer with 16 or 32mb ram... I was thinking of ubuntu or kubuntu but now I understand that they are slow on that computer so I think I will go with bsd instead and a simple xwindows installtion with just mozilla... ugly but functional
[04:33] <stepanstas> jrib, which is easier? and how
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[04:33] <devilsadvocate> senator^, i'm not entirely certain but i think xubuntu will work on that hardware
[04:33] <devilsadvocate> the ram is the only thing that might be a problem
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[04:34] <Donald1> davin^afk: so i copy this into my /etc/apt/sources.list and then i save it
[04:34] <devilsadvocate> you will have to check the xubunut site for specifications
[04:34] <senator^> devilsadvocate ok a little while ago people sad it will be very slow if it works at all on that hardware
[04:34] <spx2> how do i get hold of the universe repository ?
[04:34] <davin^afk> Donald1: yes
=== reus is now known as MegaR0m
[04:34] <jrib> !universe | spx2
[04:34] <ubotu> spx2: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[04:34] <senator^> devilsadvocate couldnt find any spec. on ubuntus webpage :(
[04:34] <davin^afk> Donald1: make it empty first though
[04:34] <devilsadvocate> senator^, gnome and kde will not be able to run on that hardware. ubuntulite will but it uses icewm
[04:34] <jrib> stepanstas: try this first to see if it resolves the problem:  close all instances of firefox.  Then in a terminal:    export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 ; firefox
[04:35] <Donald1> davin^afk: done
[04:35] <Fortis> senator: Use Xubuntu, it uses XFCE
[04:35] <Fortis> Very userfriendly
[04:35] <senator^> devilsadvocate anyway I think I chose openbsd and xwindows without any kde or other enhancement and the only firefox... think that will be fast, secure and functional but ugly interface :)
[04:36] <senator^> Fortis ok is xunbuntu faster?
[04:36] <devilsadvocate> senator^, you could go to #xubuntuand ask if you like
[04:36] <davin^afk> Donald1: now 'sudo apt-get remove fluxtorrent' then 'sudo apt-get install fluxtorrent'
[04:36] <Fortis> I'm not sure, but it will be better usefull.
[04:36] <gOldZahN> hey now i'm at the step of choosing the busid if there are multiple-video cards, but i just have one graphic card and i cant continue with reconfiguring my X pressing enter. is the configuring process already finished or is it a bug?
[04:36] <Fortis> !xubuntu
[04:36] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[04:37] <senator^> how secure is ubuntu? is there remote holes in the default install?
[04:37] <Donald1> davin^afk: now it says E: Type ( is not known on line 2 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list

[04:49] <eneried> your welcome IndrOp
[04:49] <BigToe|22days> I forgot the webpage of it
[04:49] <BigToe|22days> :S
[04:49] <senator^> bogi thanks
[04:50] <bokey> BigToe|22days, you got xp cd ? there's a program called fixmbr
[04:50] <senator^> BigToe fdisk /mbr I think in dos
[04:50] <BigToe|22days> that works?
[04:50] <BigToe|22days> for fixing grub?
[04:50] <BigToe|22days> wow
[04:50] <bokey> senator^, haha.. yeah something like that
[04:50] <bokey> =)
[04:51] <robbbb> afternoon all..
[04:51] <AcidUK> BigToe|22days: you'll need to reinstall grub into the MBR
[04:51] <bokey> BigToe|22days, that will work. fdisk /mbr =) lol used windows so looong ago.
[04:51] <H3g3m0n> BigToe|22days: grub-install /dev/yourdrivebutnotthepartitionnumber
[04:51] <robbbb> what is the program that does the screensaver on edgy?
[04:51] <igge> how can I see what package that provides a certain file?
[04:51] <devilsadvocate> robbbb, xscreensaver?
[04:51] <BigToe|22days> 'fdisk' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
[04:51] <BigToe|22days> operable program or batch file.
[04:52] <devilsadvocate> BigToe|22days, grub-install
[04:52] <robbbb> devilsadvocate: cool thanks
[04:52] <dyland> OK my chipset is an intel Q 965 Express
[04:52] <bokey> BigToe|22days, is there a program called fixmbr ?
[04:52] <misc--> does anyone here have a working dspam/postfix setup?
[04:52] <BigToe|22days> nope bokey
[04:52] <AcidUK> bokey: he wants to reinstall grub
[04:52] <robbbb> is that the same app that does the password prompt?
[04:52] <dyland> OK my chipset is an intel Q 965 Express is it compatible with ubuntu ??
[04:52] <AcidUK> not the window bootloader
[04:52] <jrib> igge: apt-file or use packages.ubuntu.com
[04:52] <BigToe|22days> devilsadvocate how do I use that?
[04:52] <stepansta1> i am a new bee, quick question, how do i change to 24 bit?
[04:52] <princemackenzie> bokey, yes
[04:52] <AcidUK> BigToe|22days: i'd suggest booting using an ubuntu livecd
[04:53] <bokey> princemackenzie, ?
[04:53] <jrib> igge: if you mean you want to see what package owns a file you have installed, use dpkg -S or dlocate -S
[04:53] <AcidUK> and then reinstalling grub
[04:53] <princemackenzie> bokey if you run it from the windows recovery console, it overwrites the MBR
[04:53] <igge> jrib: bash: apt-file: command not found
[04:53] <jrib> igge: install it :)
[04:53] <jesse__> through synaptic
[04:53] <bokey> princemackenzie, yeah.. it was so loong ago.. it forgot
[04:53] <bokey> =)
[04:53] <BigToe|22days> AcidUK how do I reinstall grub? just grub-install?
[04:53] <jesse__> ye

[04:53] <jesse__> i think
[04:53] <jrib> !helpme | spx2

[04:54] <bokey> spx2, !ask
[04:54] <jesse__> spx2: Yes?
[04:54] <stepansta1> how do i change to  24-bit?
[04:54] <princemackenzie> bokey, yeah but if your boot sector is not on the same HD as your windows install, it borks it =P
[04:54] <H3g3m0n> BigToe|22days: grub-install, you could do it with grub but you would need to know the commands
[04:54] <bokey> princemackenzie, right.
[04:54] <devilsadvocate> BigToe|22days, grub-install --help
[04:54] <spx2> jesse__ i have a big problem with my laptop,my usb mouse doesn't work on ubuntu

[05:04] <devilsadvocate> senator^zZz, the ops here dont flaunt their status. they only add the % when they need to
[05:04] <stepansta1> so if i was to change 16 to 24, save, restart, will it work?

[05:05] <jesse__> i know
[05:05] <dyland> hello i have a computer with intel core 2 duo, and a chipset intel Q965 Express, and a nvidia card, but the live cd doesn't run, anyone can help me??
[05:05] <senator^zZz> devilsadvocate ok I see... seems so in order here and no operators, back In my days when there was irc channels with 1000 people in it we needed bots and operators 24/7 to keep in order
[05:05] <jesse__> spx2:> look for it on the device manager
[05:06] <Stormx2> Anyway. Screenshot software that takes only the currently active window?
[05:06] <spx2> jesse__ where is the dev manager ?
[05:06] <jrib> stepansta1: you can try that if you feel comfortable doing so, notice that is in the "Screen" section.  Be sure to make a backup.  If X does not start after your change do you know how to get to a tty and restore the backup?
=== acez is now known as aceZ
[05:06] <bokey> senator^zZz, there are bots here.
[05:06] <jesse__> system, administration
[05:06] <devilsadvocate> senator^zZz, you still have opes in many channels. thins place has 952 people if you havent noticed
[05:06] <Unimatrix9> printscreen?
[05:06] <devilsadvocate> dyland, I'm afraid the 965 chipset is hell with linux
[05:06] <stepansta1> jrib, no but i think this method will be easier for me, ill take the risk
[05:07] <jesse__> unitmatrix9:>alt + Print Screen
=== aceZ is now known as acez
[05:07] <frying_fish> Stormx2: press alt+ print screen ?
[05:07] <Stormx2> frying_fish: Ah yeah I just figured
[05:07] <Stormx2> frying_fish: I'm used to Alt Gr, see.
[05:07] <BigToe|22days> hey what's this
[05:07] <Unimatrix9> you can use gimp for screenshots too
[05:07] <BigToe|22days> I have to buy the new CDs? :S
[05:07] <frying_fish> ahh/
[05:07] <senator^zZz> bokey ok yeah I see you use the ! to command the bots, but I didnt think the bots could do much without @ infront of there nicknames... this network is diffrent from the once I used before
[05:07] <stepansta1> jrib, hopefully, ill see you in a bit
[05:07] <Stormx2> BigToe|22days: Hmm?
[05:07] <jrib> stepansta1: if X does not start, press ctrl-alt-f1, that gets you a terminal.  To make the backup,  sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[05:07] <frying_fish> BigToe|22days: only at the cost of the cd, or you can download them for free.
[05:07] <spx2> jesse_ how can i find what distro i have ?
[05:07] <eneried> devilsadvocate, unfortunately some of us must disagree with the "there are 953 users connected here" there are 953 connecytions stablished to irc chanel only, if reallly were 953 users here, any of them ask when any of us make asimple question
[05:08] <BigToe|22days> frying_fish I don't have a working CD burner though
[05:08] <bokey> senator^zZz, =)
[05:08] <dyland> :(
[05:08] <dyland> buuu
[05:08] <BigToe|22days> so I'm just downloading 6.06 then upgrading
[05:08] <BigToe|22days> er
[05:08] <BigToe|22days> by downloading
[05:08] <jrib> stepanstas: obviously, make the backup now :)   To restore would just be:  sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:08] <eneried> ok
[05:08] <BigToe|22days> I mean getting a cd
[05:08] <bogi> BigToe|22days: ask the question, with exact info about the error messages, if the answer is in the manual, you will be instructed to rtfm, sometimes politely, sometimes less so.
[05:08] <frying_fish> ok
[05:08] <eneried> could somebody aske me a litte question?
[05:08] <Stormx2> Wow
[05:08] <dyland> thanks
[05:08] <jesse__> unitmatrix9:>goto system, help, and then system documentation, then click on about ubuntu
[05:08] <jrib> eneried: what is 1 + 1?  What do you mean?
[05:08] <eneried> what the hell in this worl uses gstreamer and is better than the damn totem?
[05:08] <Stormx2> This channel has gone to pot in 6 months o.o no one used to say rtfm..
[05:09] <Unimatrix9> i did not ask anything
[05:09] <Unimatrix9> :)
[05:09] <senator^zZz> devilsadvocate I did see that, I meant about 1000 people when I said 1000 people
[05:09] <strabes> wow stop arguing
[05:09] <bokey> Stormx2, if you say rtfm, noobs won't understand it. ;)
[05:09] <strabes> this channel is for HELP
[05:09] <jesse__> unitmatrix9:>sorry
[05:09] <strabes> you're not supposed to say rtfm here
[05:09] <eneried> jrib, i mean if i make a question, and is true that moere than 900 people are here, even one of this big grioup could answer me
[05:09] <Stormx2> bokey, yeah I know... they just ask more xD
[05:09] <Stormx2> Yeah
[05:09] <devilsadvocate> rtfm?
[05:09] <jesse__> rtfm?
[05:09] <strabes> devilsadvocate: read the ******* manual
[05:10] <Stormx2> devilsadvocate, read the fine manual
[05:10] <Unimatrix9> eneried try again
[05:10] <bokey> Stormx2, haha..
[05:10] <devilsadvocate> ah
[05:10] <jesse__> i don't get it?
[05:10] <strabes> yeah so you're NOT supposed to say that here
[05:10] <robbbb> looser talk
[05:10] <Jannis> hi all!
[05:10] <jesse__> what is rtfm?
[05:10] <Stormx2> Hey Jannis
[05:10] <jrib> !rtfm
[05:10] <ubotu> Words like noob, jfgi, stfu or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
[05:10] <pradeep> friendly*
[05:10] <Stormx2> jesse__: Google it.
[05:10] <Stormx2> jesse__: or take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[05:10] <jesse__> stormx2:> ok
[05:10] <Jannis> I have downloaded ubuntu, what now?
[05:11] <Stormx2> !install
[05:11] <ubotu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[05:11] <Unimatrix9> read the manual pages, but a better suggestion would be , try google and see if there is any info on your quest
[05:11] <bokey> jesse__, back in the golden days and still prevails in #linux and #freebsd when anyone asked something that was outrightly in the manuals, the person would be told to *rtfm*. read the f*** manual
[05:11] <frying_fish> Jannis: burn it to disk and boot the computer from that disk?
[05:11] <eneried> in your opinion what is the best video player available in ubuntu? (i'm looking for a replace to totem)
[05:11] <Jannis> ok
[05:11] <Unimatrix9> eneried its mplayer
[05:11] <Stormx2> Jannis: Check the links ubotu just gave you
[05:11] <Stormx2> Jannis: They explain it in a lot of depth
[05:11] <strabes> Jannis: do you know how to burn an ISO image?
[05:11] <jesse__> oh OK
[05:11] <jrib> eneried: mplayer, xine-ui, gxine, totem-xine, vlc are all good
[05:11] <jesse__> ???
[05:11] <jesse__> sorry
[05:12] <Jannis> no?
[05:12] <eneried> ok, one vote to mplayer, any other alternative?
[05:12] <Unimatrix9> eneried , and you need codecs too
[05:12] <spx2> jesse__ where is the device manager
[05:12] <spx2> jesse__ where is the device manager ?
[05:12] <Stormx2> Jannis: Please check the wiki.
[05:12] <frying_fish> eneried: I would vote vlc
[05:12] <jrib> eneried: mplayer is the best imo as well
[05:12] <Stormx2> Jannis: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
[05:12] <eneried> jrib all of them uses xine engine, i'm right?
[05:12] <frying_fish> vlc for the fact that you don't need to get extra codecs
[05:12] <Unimatrix9> eneried ,  what would you like it to play?
[05:12] <BeNikis> eneried,  i vote vlc :D
[05:12] <Stormx2> VLC is good for video
[05:12] <jesse__> spx2:> click on system, administration
[05:13] <frying_fish> vlc is great for video
[05:13] <bogi> bye 4 now
[05:13] <eneried> i often play from avi to mpg passing by mov, divx and xvid
[05:13] <frying_fish> all of which will play in vlc
[05:13] <frying_fish> Stormx2: same for the music front
[05:13] <eneried> anything, and i use to have two or three players at same time in machine, because sometimes vlc or mplayer cannot render a malformed video
[05:13] <Arigato> is it possible to enable seccomp without recompiling the kernel?
[05:13] <senator^zZz> !rules
[05:13] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[05:13] <eneried> but definitely tiotem is not the third choice
[05:13] <Unimatrix9> eneried  : install vlc and give it a try and come back after the movie
[05:13] <frying_fish> although, something fucked with checkinstall makes the compiling from source fun.
[05:13] <jrib> eneried: of the ones I mentioned, vlc and mplayer don't use xine
[05:13] <frying_fish> ahh, language bad
[05:14] <frying_fish> apologies
[05:14] <Unimatrix9> hee jono
[05:14] <jono> hey
[05:14] <Unimatrix9> nice to see you here!
[05:14] <jono> :)
[05:14] <jesse__> spx2:> if it's not there then goto applications then accessoires then alterte menu editor and check off device manager
[05:15] <eneried> jrib, hehe, good! then vlc and mplayer and xine remains in my list
[05:15] <frying_fish> I wonder if the latest audacious (being that it now has a debian developer) will come with the debian control scripts for us to compile using dpkg
[05:15] <Stormx2> frying_fish: It has a debian developer? sweet
[05:15] <eneried> Unimatrix, jrib, frying_fish any good alternative that uses gstremer engine??
[05:15] <frying_fish> Stormx2: it does now.
[05:15] <Stormx2> eneried: xine.
[05:16] <frying_fish> eneried: I don't use gstreamer apps.
[05:16] <frying_fish> vlc and audacious for me.
[05:16] <jesse__> can someone help me with spx2?
[05:16] <Spee_Der> Good day folks.
[05:16] <Stormx2> jesse__: Whats the issue?
[05:16] <Unimatrix9> eneried  : does it matter, as long as it works
[05:16] <spx2> jesse__ i found it at computer/ixp sb400 usb host controller/ohci host controller/f8e842-DL mouse/USB HID interface/HID 1241:1177   - here it reads capabilities input,input.mouse ---> so this is it :)
[05:16] <jesse__> stormx2:> see spx2
[05:16] <jesse__> he needs help with his usb mouse
[05:17] <Stormx2> hmm
[05:17] <eneried> Unimatrix, I use vlc, and i like it a lot, mplayer is very hard to put to work as well as desired, but i can't take my time wrking on it, xine as a bakup alternative...
[05:17] <jesse__> i have been trying to help him but i can't see the exact problem
[05:17] <Stormx2> spx2: Had a look on the forums?
[05:17] <frying_fish> jesse__: usb mouse that doesn't work?
[05:17] <eneried> Stormx2 i'm looking for a replace for totem, but an alternative that really uses gstreamer
[05:17] <munkay> eneried: what's so difficult to get to work w/ mplayer ?
[05:17] <spx2> Stormx2 read about 15 posts on similar problems(couldn't find my problem exactly)
[05:17] <frying_fish> tbh vlc is quite versatile.
[05:17] <jesse__> frying_fish:>spx2's usb mouse doesn't work
[05:18] <Stormx2> eneried: Totem uses gstreamer doesn't it? The only other real alternatives are VLC (I recommend it!) and mplayer
[05:18] <eneried> i make a list of 4 video players, vlc, mplayer, xine, and i need one working with gstreamer
[05:18] <frying_fish> spx2: what about it doesn't work?
[05:18] <Stormx2> eneried: Install totem-gstreamer? xD
[05:18] <Unimatrix9> spx2 there is an alternative, you  could use an usb to ps2 adapter, but i guess thats not what you want?
[05:18] <jesse__> frying_fish:>my usb mouse works fine and it's a dell, I plugged right in and it worked
[05:18] <spx2> Stormx2 frying_fish if you want to help look here first : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311462
[05:18] <eneried> i have totem-gstreamer, but i don't like totem, totem crashes and have not enough options
[05:19] <spx2> frying_fish unimatrix9 if you want to help look here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311462
[05:19] <Stormx2> eneried: VLC then
[05:19] <frying_fish> usb mice just work normally
[05:19] <eneried> i'm planning to uninstall totem-gstreamer, and if there's no other alternative using gstreamer codec, uninstall them too
[05:19] <jesse__> frying_fish:>yeh they are plug-and-play =
[05:19] <frying_fish> my mx500, my friends wireless ms kit, any other usb mouse I have ever tried just works.
[05:19] <jesse__> :)
[05:19] <Zac1> how do I upload to my MP3 player
[05:19] <strabes> yeah usb mice are pretty plug-and-play...
[05:19] <eneried> wich codecs does xine use?
[05:19] <spx2> unimatrix9 no that's not an option :(
[05:19] <Stormx2> Zac1: What kind of MP3 player do you have?
[05:19] <strabes> Zac1: that depends on what type of mp3 player you have
[05:20] <Unimatrix9> what does dmesg show when plugged in?
[05:20] <Zac1> Bus-LInk
[05:20] <eneried> does xine use gstremer or w32codecs?
[05:20] <Stormx2> Zac1: Manufacturer?
[05:20] <jesse__> what do you mean?
[05:20] <Zac1> bus-link
[05:20] <jesse__> ok usb-bus
[05:20] <spx2> unimatrix9 please write spx2 in front of your message to me otherwise i will not see it because there's lots of people writing here ,thank you
[05:20] <Stormx2> Zac1: Does it use ID3 tag management?
[05:20] <Unimatrix9> ah
[05:20] <spx2> unimatrix9 what command do you want me to run ? please state exactly
[05:20] <Zac1> I don't know
[05:21] <Stormx2> Zac1: Hmm. Hold on.
[05:21] <jesse__> loads of people helping you now spx2
[05:21] <Stormx2> Zac1: I'll look it up for you.
[05:21] <strabes> Stormx2, Zac1, how did you upload songs to it in windows?
[05:21] <spx2> jesse__ thank you
[05:21] <strabes> Stormx2: http://www.buslink.com/B1/products.asp?CatId=5&SubCatID1=21
[05:21] <frying_fish> spx2: what does lsusb give you, and then cat /proc/bus/input/devices
[05:21] <jurgen> Hi... I've just installed Ubuntu 6.10 - now I'm trying to install LAMP (Apache-PHP-MySQL) for testing sites locally... but the "server" disc is not there...
[05:21] <frying_fish> what information does that give for your mouse
[05:21] <Zac1> using the supplied program
[05:21] <jesse__> spx2:> i will still try to help in any case
[05:21] <eneried> Another question, what plugin is the best for playing video inside a web page on firefox or mozilla?
[05:21] <frying_fish> as you should be using the event number from that for your mouse
[05:22] <frying_fish> if it doesn't just work
[05:22] <frying_fish> eneried: mplayer-plugin?
[05:22] <jesse__> frying_fish:>according to spx2, it doesn't work at all
[05:22] <frying_fish> the vlc plugin is getting there.
[05:22] <strabes> Zac1: does it automount when you plug it in?
[05:22] <Stormx2> Zac1: Please tell me what model it is. Here is a list: http://www.buslink.com/B1/products.asp?CatId=5&SubCatID1=21

[05:23] <strabes> Zac1: can you give us a link to that mp3 player? I can't find it on their website
[05:23] <princemackenzie> sam1982, flash 9 is a beta
[05:23] <Afief> Hello, since i upgraded to Edgy i cannot detect any wireless networks although then driver(ipw2200) is loaded. it used to work on dapper
[05:23] <jesse__> realplayer
[05:23] <Zac1> no
[05:23] <iGadget> princemackenzie: np, thanks for listening anyway :)
[05:23] <eneried> sam1982 i can try
[05:23] <Unimatrix9> sam1982 state nature of problem
[05:24] <iGadget> anyone else? :)
[05:24] <frying_fish> iGadget: booting yes (if you mean wakeonlan)
[05:24] <DralaFi> martin pitt here?
[05:24] <sam1982> ~~  Problem  ~~  everytime i click on MAIL in the sg.yahoo.com website it cses the web browser.  also some other websites   seems to be those that contain flash...
[05:24] <strabes> Zac1: if we don't know anything about your mp3 player we can't help you.
[05:24] <eneried> realplayer... i can use the official realplayer, and then i don't need to have gstreamer on machine, is that idea a good idea?
[05:24] <DralaFi> pmount software author?
[05:24] <Stormx2> Zac1: Okay. Plug it in.
[05:24] <strabes> Zac1: how many gigs is it
[05:24] <Stormx2> Zac1: Does it connect via USB?
[05:24] <Afief> Hello, since i upgraded to Edgy i cannot detect any wireless networks although then driver(ipw2200) is loaded. it used to work on dapper. Is there a way to fix this?
[05:25] <Stormx2> strabes: Its 128mb.
[05:25] <sam1982> ~~~  not sure how this happened but i just updated to 9 this morning and its never been right since.
[05:25] <iGadget> frying_fish: well wakeonlan is just making the pc power up by receiving a magic packet from lan, right?
[05:25] <Zac1> serial no e21150524a
[05:25] <Stormx2> Zac1: Plug it in.
[05:25] <strabes> Stormx2: then it probably just has a folder with mp3 files in it
[05:25] <Stormx2> strabes: Yeah i'd assume so.
[05:25] <frying_fish> yeah, but that counts as booting from lan
[05:25] <strabes> Afief: sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
[05:25] <Zac1> ok
[05:25] <frying_fish> unless you mean boot an image stored across lan.
[05:25] <strabes> Zac1: what happens when you plug it into the computer?
[05:25] <Stormx2> Zac1, does it connect via USB?
[05:25] <Zac1> nothing
[05:25] <Afief> strabes: it is installed, but doesn't detect any networks
[05:26] <iGadget> frying_fish: that's exactly what I mean... I have a pc here which refuses to boot from cd or floppy
[05:26] <strabes> Afief: is SSID broadcasting enabled on your router? Do you have scanning enabled on your computer?
[05:26] <jesse__> spx2:> any progress?
[05:26] <Unimatrix9> sam1982  - you could donwload an new one, and unpack it somewhere , and run that one, it will see your old settings
[05:26] <zspada15> (offtopic) anyone who wants to read something about why they should switch to ubuntu from windows, here is a post in my blog: http://zspada15.blogspot.com/
[05:26] <frying_fish> oh, well sorry no I don't but it can be done, I think.
[05:26] <Stormx2> Zac1, Please go to My Computer (under Places). Is it listed? It will look something like "128mb Volume"
[05:26] <sam1982> uni ~~  what should i download?
[05:26] <Unimatrix9> did i miss an messege of spx2?
[05:26] <DralaFi> pmount /dev/sda1    mount: mount point /mnt/usbdisk does not exist
[05:26] <iGadget> frying_fish: I know it can, but I just don't know how :)
[05:26] <DralaFi> Why in /mnt ?
[05:26] <Afief> strabes: on my router it is, i don't know how to enable it on the PC, but it used to scan just fine in dapper
[05:26] <strabes> Zac1: what does this command output: dmesg |grep link
[05:27] <PiTcReW> shit

[05:29] <spx2> i have a ubuntu 6.10 installed on
[05:29] <Stormx2> Stop.
[05:29] <spx2> a laptop wich is a toshiba L100-194.
[05:30] <spx2> i have also a mouse - usb canyon cn-msopt2.
[05:30] <Stormx2> FFS people!
[05:30] <spx2> i just wanted to specify to make things clear.
[05:30] <sam1982> http://zspada15.blogspot.com/   < whos website is this?
[05:30] <Stormx2> spx2: Stop.
[05:30] <spx2> now,the problem is that i have tried for
[05:30] <spx2> an entire day to make the usb mouse work,and
[05:30] <zspada15> sam1982, mine
[05:30] <spx2> have not succeded in doing so.
[05:30] <spx2> the problem seems to be that somehow the mouse
[05:30] <spx2> is influenced by the synnaptic pad OR ubuntu does
[05:30] <spx2> not have the proper drivers to be able to talk
[05:30] <spx2> to the usb mouse.

[05:30] <sam1982> zspada15 ~~  how old are you ?
[05:30] <eneried> how can i set default applications in ubuntu? i don't want to play videos with totem, i want to make vlc default for some, and mplayer for some others, any idea?
[05:30] <Unimatrix9> he is banned?
[05:30] <Stormx2> Zac1, still there?
[05:30] <zspada15> sam1982, send me a pm and ill talk to u, dont wanna flood the shannel
[05:31] <frying_fish> whoever wrote that blog really needs to learn how to write something properly before posting it and suggesting people actually read it.
[05:31] <borg> what's the command that lists all your hardware?
[05:31] <frying_fish> spx2: link to what you want me to look at.
[05:31] <RichiH> !ops for your information, i just used my staff powers to override two floods -- i hope i did not act against any internal policy :/
[05:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ops for your information, i just used my staff powers to override two floods -- i hope i did not act against any internal policy :/ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:31] <strabes> borg: dmesg
[05:31] <RichiH> bleh
[05:31] <Unimatrix9> banned the wrong one
[05:31] <borg> heh, that command keeps changing names, before it was lcpci or something like that
[05:31] <Warbo> Hi. I'm having some troubles with networking on my laptop and am wondering where to begin. lspci tells me "Network Controller: Broadcom Corporation Unknown Device 4311 (rev01)" and "Ehternet Controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX (rev 02)" Any pointers would be appreciated :)
[05:31] <frying_fish> spx2: what is the output of "cat /proc/bus/input/devices"
[05:32] <Zac1> How do i upload to a buslink MP3 player
[05:32] <z|George> Is there anyway to change this resolution of 1024x768 to a higher resolution? I read somewhere about editing xorg.conf, but I tried and it wouldn't save because I didn't have proper permissions, which is probably because I'm running off LiveCD (Until I get a second hard drive)
[05:32] <Stormx2> RichiH: How come you have ops? ^__^
[05:32] <Stormx2> Zac1: Please listen
[05:32] <eneried> hey, could somebodu help me? i want to change my video default application, how can i do that?
[05:32] <Stormx2> Zac1: Is the device powered on, and plugged in?
[05:32] <Zac1> yes
[05:32] <G3N3SIS> What is a good way to use my software from Windows on Linux for free.  As well as efficiently.
[05:32] <Stormx2> Zac1: Have you looked under Places > My Computer
[05:32] <Zac1> yes
[05:32] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: WINE
[05:32] <Fortis> Genesis: Wine
[05:32] <G3N3SIS> I need Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Flash.
[05:32] <RichiH> Stormx2: i don't
[05:32] <Stormx2> Zac1: Nothing there at all?
[05:32] <G3N3SIS> Does Wine work well?
[05:33] <frying_fish> G3N3SIS: look for a linux alternative.
[05:33] <Zac1> nothing there
[05:33] <RichiH> Stormx2: i am freenode staff
[05:33] <Fortis> Genesis: For the most things: yes
[05:33] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: Depends
[05:33] <jesse__> i'm back
[05:33] <frying_fish> for photoshop: try the gimp, flash, well there you are kind of boned.
[05:33] <Warbo> z|George: use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to set it up, then press ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a console and run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
[05:33] <Stormx2> RichiH: Ah, lucky ^__^
[05:33] <frying_fish> and dreamweaver, use an alternative.
[05:33] <J4kch> g3n3sis: Yeah, linux alternatives are usually best
[05:33] <G3N3SIS> Yeah, I'm a web dev though, I need to be able to slice and stuff.
[05:33] <Fortis> For dreamweaver use NVU
[05:33] <strabes> Stormx2: it's not automounting. We need to find where it is in /dev and then manually mount it
[05:33] <G3N3SIS> Dreamweaver, I can live without.
[05:33] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: Ah, an issue I have.
[05:33] <frying_fish> "web dev" and you use dreamweaver? why not just code it manually as you should.
[05:33] <DralaFi> heh, so much noise in here
[05:33] <G3N3SIS> Flash, I enjoy spending time in
[05:33] <Warbo> Moho/AnimeStudio is better than Flash for animation I find, but no luck for web apps (no scripting). Also it's hard to get hold of
[05:33] <Fortis> I don't know a alternative for Flash..
[05:33] <frying_fish> flash, don't use flash it is horrible.
[05:33] <G3N3SIS> I do FF
[05:33] <strabes> Stormx2, Zac1: go to system, preferences, removable drives and media
[05:34] <Stormx2> frying_fish: You're not helping. Read what he said. He needs to slice.
[05:34] <eneried> G3N3SIS my opinion, set a dual bootable machine, keep thos software on windows and use linux for the rest
[05:34] <Zac1> ok
[05:34] <z|George> I'm on a LiveCD and was wondering if I could raise the screen res. I'm stuck at 1024x768 on my 17"LCD :-\
[05:34] <G3N3SIS> I code manually, I just like the server uploads that Dreamweaver has.
[05:34] <strabes> eneried, G3N3SIS: that is a good idea
[05:34] <eneried> or install a virtual machine in linux to install windows inside
[05:34] <strabes> G3N3SIS: just dual boot with a shared fat32 or ext3 partition
[05:34] <G3N3SIS> I already have that eneried,
[05:34] <Dheeraj_k> can any body tell me how apt works?
[05:34] <Warbo> z|George: Look up, I told you how :)
[05:34] <Zac1> OK
[05:34] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: Ah everyone does. A good FTP client is FireFTP if you need one.
[05:34] <frying_fish> G3N3SIS: "server uploads" can easily be done by ftp (either with something like gftp or command line) or scp (through ssh)
[05:34] <jesse__> yeh it helps to have windows as a backup even through i have never really had a problem with linux
[05:34] <G3N3SIS> FireFTP?
[05:35] <eneried> then the second option is good for you if your machine have enough memory hard disk and processor
[05:35] <G3N3SIS> I got gftp, but I think I'll look into FireFTP
[05:35] <Fortis> dheeraj: sudo apt-get install appname
[05:35] <z|George> Warbo: Oh, excellent - Guess I didn't see it in the scrolling-ness :P
[05:35] <sain> i tried to play Call of Duty on the ubuntu but it didn't work or whatever
[05:35] <sain> linux suxors
[05:35] <G3N3SIS> Oh you mean the Firefox addons
[05:35] <Warbo> z|George: Trouble is, you'll have to do it every time you boot the CD :(
[05:35] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: Its a plugin for Firefox
[05:35] <J4kch> sain: Tried Wine or Cedega?
[05:35] <jesse__> ubuntu linux rocks!
[05:35] <sain> i even reloaded with shift pressed and that
[05:35] <Unimatrix9> http://frankscorner.org/
[05:35] <G3N3SIS> yeah I know.
[05:35] <Unimatrix9> for wine
[05:35] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: However, its the best client. gFTP is... horrible
=== r00t-fck is now known as x-r00t-x
[05:35] <eneried> i have worked in design, and at this time there are not good alternatives to following programs: macromedia, corel, photoshop autocad
[05:35] <strabes> G3N3SIS: sftp is a command-based secure ftp client
[05:35] <Zac1> I'm there
[05:35] <DralaFi> jesse__, Linux rocks. Ubuntu might or miht not rock.
[05:36] <G3N3SIS> I don't want a command line based thing.
[05:36] <Stormx2> eneried: Macromedia is a company.
[05:36] <sain> J4kch, i don't want to install all programs and that
[05:36] <strabes> Zac1: where?
[05:36] <G3N3SIS> I'd rather just have a GUI.
[05:36] <jesse__> well i know both
[05:36] <sain> i just want to play Call of Duty
[05:36] <Dheeraj_k> Fortis: that i know but
[05:36] <frying_fish> G3N3SIS: why not, how do you access the server anyway?
[05:36] <Zac1> Removable drives
[05:36] <eneried> sain try Cedega
[05:36] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: FireFTP is the way to go then
[05:36] <Fortis> Coral is a company too..
[05:36] <J4kch> sain: well, you need either Wine or Cedega for that...
[05:36] <Unimatrix9> sain, for gamers windows is still the platform
[05:36] <Dheeraj_k> but i found it little bit slow
[05:36] <G3N3SIS> Well, I like the ftp GUI's.
[05:36] <sain> ok i will try wine or cedega
[05:36] <jesse__> yeh
[05:36] <G3N3SIS> Yeah, I'm gonna go grab Cedega now.
[05:36] <Unimatrix9> sain look here
[05:36] <Unimatrix9> http://frankscorner.org/
[05:36] <J4kch> sain: Cedega is best, but you gotta pay
[05:36] <eneried> G3N3SIS fireftp plugin for firefox
[05:36] <Fortis> Cedega is paid
[05:36] <frying_fish> cedega cost monies.
[05:37] <Fortis> Wine is free
[05:37] <strabes> Zac1: say my name when you're talking to me so that I get notified. make sure that automounting of your mp3 player or anything else that could relate to your device is checked.
[05:37] <G3N3SIS> had it on windows eneried.
[05:37] <nothlit> You can use cedega cvs
[05:37] <G3N3SIS> It was decent.
[05:37] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: Cedega costs. Why do you need wine anyway. What app you emulating?
[05:37] <Fortis> The only thing cedega has is directX
[05:37] <Warbo> Cedega CVS is free, but doesn't have copy-protection-breakingness (for legal reasons)
[05:37] <sain> is wine as good as cedega though?
[05:37] <G3N3SIS> I want to emulate PS.
[05:37] <eneried> Fortis, you must pay to for Call of Duty
[05:37] <G3N3SIS> Sain: You can use the CVS
[05:37] <Zac1> strabes: what, ok
[05:37] <Dheeraj_k> i am looking for technical detail about apt.
[05:37] <frying_fish> spx2: edit your xorg.conf for the mouse to say /dev/input/event1 for now
[05:37] <sain> i might just boot up windows to play it
[05:37] <Stormx2> G3N3SIS: Try GIMP-Shop. its not as good but meh. You get used to it. Personally I emulate Paint Shop Pro 7
[05:37] <sain> too much hassles
[05:37] <frying_fish> instead of mouse1
[05:37] <Dheeraj_k> any site?
[05:38] <Warbo> G3N3SIS: Take a look through the repositories, I think there are playstation emulators in there
[05:38] <eneried> sain, wine is as good if you take your time tunning it
[05:38] <Warbo> oops
[05:38] <J4kch> sain: Good thinking
[05:38] <Warbo> photoshop?
[05:38] <Warbo> sorry
[05:38] <Stormx2> Dheeraj_k: Google is your friend.
[05:38] <DralaFi> Dheeraj_k, google might know. You could also read the source.
[05:38] <G3N3SIS> Well, I am fine with making the image, just I need to slice my layouts.
[05:38] <Fortis> !apt
[05:38] <ubotu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[05:38] <Dheeraj_k> i want to integrate it with mysql
[05:38] <Stormx2> Dheeraj_k: In what way?
[05:38] <strabes> Zac1: make sure "Mount Remavable drives when hot-plugged" and "Mount removable media when inserted" are checked
[05:38] <frying_fish> and spx2 it shoudl be mouse0 currently not mouse1 as thats your touchpad.  I would also suggest learning how to write a udev rule for it and make it appear somewhere different and use that other place.
[05:38] <eneried> Stormx", G3N3SIS, there's a problem in gimp, it cannot work with ymck, and it is essential to designers, if you only need web design GIMP is the best option you could make
[05:38] <RichiH> Stormx2: more work than privilege ;)
[05:39] <Unimatrix9> sain, you could play american army its a first shooter game too, or enemy territory
[05:39] <strabes> !dmesg | Zac1
[05:39] <J4kch> I'm having problems downloading stuff with Synaptic and Aptitude, anyone care to help?
[05:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dmesg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:39] <sain> Dheeraj_k, you want to integrate apt with mysql?
[05:39] <G3N3SIS> what;s ymck
[05:39] <Dybber> How do I get Java running in Firefox? I can run java applications just fine, but applets doesnt work. (Im using edgy)
[05:39] <Warbo> I hear Krita does CYMK, but I have not used it yet
[05:39] <Dheeraj_k> to keep the package detail in database
[05:39] <sain> Unimatrix9, castle wolfenstein
[05:39] <mama> hey i have a question every time i go to a website like youtube the page crashes....HELP :)
[05:39] <Unimatrix9> yeah
[05:39] <Stormx2> eneried: It cannot work with YMCK? YMCK is a japanese 8-bit band I quite like...
[05:39] <Unimatrix9> thats the one
[05:39] <J4kch> mama: What browser you using?
[05:39] <Zac1> Strabes: It is checked? What next
[05:39] <strabes> Zac1: you need to figure out where your device is located in /dev, so then you can manually mount it.
[05:39] <mama> firefox
[05:39] <sain> Dheeraj_k, so pull down the package details into a table
[05:40] <J4kch> mama: Weird, firefox never gave me no trouble
[05:40] <G3N3SIS> Wait, what's YCMK or whatever?
[05:40] <eneried> G3N3SIS a color space based on substraction, opossed to RGB bassded on addition, CMYK fits with printer machines RGB fits with screens
[05:40] <G3N3SIS> oh.
[05:40] <Warbo> G3N3SIS: A way of defining colour, useful for printing
[05:40] <Stormx2> YMCK is a good band tho xD
[05:40] <G3N3SIS> Well still, isn't that different from what I need?  I just need to slice layouts.
[05:40] <DralaFi> Yellow Cyan Magenta blacK
[05:40] <mama> any suggestions?
[05:40] <morphir> Dybber, get automatix2
[05:40] <jesse__> i'm back again
[05:40] <J4kch> mama: You have the latest version right?
[05:40] <Stormx2> Dybber: Ignore that advice given by morphir
[05:40] <Dheeraj_k> so that when i'll fireup apt-get install package it should check database and fetch package from repo
[05:41] <mama> i think so?
[05:41] <Zac1> Strabes: What is a possible device name for an mp3 player
[05:41] <Dybber> Stormx2, whats your advice then?
[05:41] <jesse__> any question?
[05:41] <Stormx2> Dybber: easyubuntu
[05:41] <sain> Dheeraj_k, yeah, you'll have to put the records into the database yourself though
[05:41] <morphir> Stormx2, why is that?
[05:41] <eneried> Stormx2, G3N3SIS, CMYK is needed to make colors on printed works match the colors you selected
[05:41] <J4kch> mama: sorry, can't help ya =/
[05:41] <Stormx2> Dybber: or just reading the pages. Automatrix breaks stuff
[05:41] <strabes> Zac1: it's going to be like /dev/sda1 or something but you're going to have to dmesg it
[05:41] <Warbo> no Broadcom networking help then?
[05:41] <Stormx2> !automatrix
[05:41] <mama> i tired to instill flash player again
[05:41] <Dheeraj_k> as a part of my college project
[05:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about automatrix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:41] <sain> Dheeraj_k, should be easy enough to script with php/perl etc
[05:41] <strabes> Zac1: just search ubuntuforums.org
[05:41] <Stormx2> !automatix

[05:46] <G3N3SIS> I'll just have to go back to Windows for this stuff then.
[05:46] <vinicri> can i do something to solve this before buy more memory
[05:46] <eneried> Fortis, tables are a really good alternative, i'm with G3N3SIS, in that thing

[05:46] <jesse__> spx2:> i'm here

[05:48] <Fortis> What is he trying then? :)
[05:48] <sain> he is trying to replicate what Dreamweaver does with slices

[05:48] <sain> where you can slice up the image and put it into tables for display
[05:49] <Fortis> Oh well, it's fine
[05:49] <nothlit> G3N3SIS, you should use gmplayer, also mencoder transcodes videos great as well but vlc has the most built in codecs

[06:11] <jrib> J4kch: I think it uses $http_proxy but synaptic may have its own settins.  General proxy is in system > preferences
[06:11] <eneried> QUESTION: what is the best place to find a binary mplayer for edgy?
[06:12] <jesse__> go on synaptic, and click reload to refresh the rep.

[06:13] <graham_100> lol

[06:13] <jrib> J4kch: settings > preferences > network  is in synaptic as well
[06:14] <sain> keyring
[06:14] <sain> ok then
[06:14] <J4kch> jrib: It is in direct connection to the internet
[06:14] <wceoscar> ok.. i just installed amsn 0.95... and noticed that they realeased 0.96.... i downloaded the package now how can i install it with the synaptic?????
[06:14] <livingdaylight> Hallo Jungs!? i want to open something with wine, but i don't see it in my list

[06:14] <ac7ss> Any one know how to change the default keyboard layout in XFCE?
[06:14] <livingdaylight> yes, i have installed it
[06:14] <sain> graham_100, what about sudo -i
[06:15] <sain> graham_100, i mean su -i
[06:15] <Yggdrasil> hey can somone help me out, i have a situation where sometimes on boot,, my hald fails, eventualy it times out and i cant run gnome, kde and flux seem to start fine.
[06:15] <mydy> 
[06:15] <Z3dzDead> Does anyone know how i can test the browsing speed- want to know if its any better on linux (or is that just a myth?)
[06:15] <jrib> graham_100: don't you mean aptitude tells you that?

[06:16] <graham_100> then i have to do that stupid  wireless card setup
[06:16] <klm-> is there a 'setting wizard' for ubuntu with which I could save my contemporary settings (programs installed, bookmarks, stuff like that) and then install a new clean version from scratch and make the wizard install all my previous settings?
[06:16] <eneried> Yggdrasil boot gnome with a different user, if gnome works bad the problem is in gnome if not the problem is in your gnome config,m then go to your home dir and fix gnome config files and folders..
[06:16] <J4kch> jrib: I'm on the network preferences, everything looks normal
[06:16] <graham_100> oh well
[06:16] <sain> graham_100, haha you gotta enjoy doing it or there's no point :)
[06:17] <jrib> J4kch: echo $http_proxy
[06:17] <lumpki> wceoscar, is it a deb file?
[06:17] <ac7ss> anyone use XFCE?
[06:17] <sain> J4kch, have you set up iptables with some frontend?
[06:17] <Yggdrasil> eneried, really ? it seems as if the hald layer .. whatever that is eeds to be fixed, something with hardware abstraction.
[06:17] <|ID|Tigerman[X64> probably a stupid question, but is there a way to write a new superblock when fsck dont feel like fixing anything?
[06:17] <sain> J4kch, i'm thinking maybe you set up a transparent proxy in iptables
[06:17] <J4kch> jrib: http://localhost:4001
=== |ID|Tigerman[X64 is now known as Tigerman
[06:18] <jrib> J4kch: well there you go
[06:18] <eneried> but if another user could start the gnome the hald setting is only to your user
[06:18] <eneried> Yggdrasil:
[06:18] <J4kch> sain: not to my knowledge but I do a lot of stuff without my knowledge =P
[06:18] <ks3> Tigerman, there are alternate superblocks throughout the partition
[06:18] <Yggdrasil> ill try it eneried
[06:19] <Tigerman> ks3 and using them to run fsck, I still get the message that the superblock is fubar..
[06:19] <sain> J4kch, heh theres' your problem, it is connecting to your machine port 4001
[06:19] <J4kch> jrib: So now how do I fix it?
[06:19] <eneried> ;)
[06:19] <eneried> i have to go now
[06:19] <eneried> thanks for the help
[06:19] <J4kch> sain: so now what?
[06:19] <eneried> ;)
[06:20] <jrib> J4kch: do you need to use a proxy?  Try    export http_proxy=""     and then run aptitude again
[06:20] <woro2006> how can I export my evolution calendar for viewing on the web?
[06:20] <ks3> Tigerman, you can do mke2fs -n /dev/xxxx to get a list of all alternate superblocks, and try each one.... hopefully one is good
[06:20] <sain> J4kch, yeah, do that (assuming you are running bash, which you probably are)
=== livingdaylight is now known as grasshopper
[06:20] <sain> J4kch, what jrib said
[06:21] <sain> J4kch, and all your problems should dissappear :)
[06:21] <Tigerman> ks3: but when i fix problems on the hdd (actually its hdc :p) using a different superblock, it wont cause new problems, or?
[06:21] <jrib> well J4kch should find out how that got set since it will probably get reset when you reboot
[06:21] <wceoscar> its a DBL file
[06:21] <ks3> Tigerman, shouldn't... i've used it successfully once or twice
[06:21] <wceoscar> DB!!!!!!!!!!
[06:22] <mwalling> is there a known problem with us.archive.ubuntu.com right now?
[06:22] <sain> jrib, yeah, or just set in in his .profile
[06:22] <ompaul> mwalling, put it in your web browser
[06:22] <Tigerman> ks3: /dev/hdc is apparently un use by the the system; will not make a filesystem here!
[06:22] <J4kch> sain, jrib: Problem remains
[06:23] <mwalling> ompaul: its been loading for ~1 minute now
[06:23] <ks3> Tigerman, so, it's already mounted?
[06:23] <ompaul> mwalling, and from in excess of 4k miles I can say no there ain't
[06:23] <jrib> J4kch: what is the error
[06:23] <Tigerman> ks3 nop
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[06:23] <sain> J4kch, what is the $http_proxy now?
[06:23] <ompaul> mumbles-off, why do nick spam?
[06:23] <J4kch> sain: still localhost
[06:23] <lumpki> wceoscar, you need to get the .deb file for ubuntu
[06:23] <ks3> Tigerman, hmmmm, for some reason fsck thinks so... does it show up in /proc/mounts?
[06:23] <mwalling> ompaul: 100% packetloss
[06:23] <Tigerman> just rebooted and didnt mount anything afterwards..
[06:24] <ompaul> mwalling, well not from this side of the atlantic - check your upstream
[06:24] <mwalling> ubuntu.com/wiki is fine
[06:24] <ks3> Tigerman, or perhaps another fsck / mkfs process has it opened?
[06:24] <ompaul> mwalling, different machines
[06:24] <ompaul> mwalling, in different locations
[06:24] <stoorty> what repositry do i need to get ntfs-3g ?
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[06:24] <Tigerman> ks3: nope

[06:25] <sain> J4kch, so you did; export $http_proxy=""
[06:25] <J4kch> sain: Whoops, forgot the $
[06:26] <sain> ok, once the $http_proxy isn't localhost, try it
[06:26] <J4kch> sain: Now I get a bunch of invalid identifier stuff
[06:26] <ompaul> mumbles, you are in a channel with 1k people and if they all did that it would be unsuable do this     >>/away put your reason here<< and then no one except the person who wants you knows that your off and we can all live in peace

[06:26] <ompaul> s/unsuable/unusable/g
[06:26] <mumbles> sory ompaul  i normlay do - my irc crashed
[06:26] <Tigerman> ks3: its not in /proc/mounts..  and there is no other mkfs/fsck processes running..
[06:26] <PiTcReW> can someone help me?
[06:27] <ompaul> k
[06:27] <PiTcReW> i can't get mp3's to play
[06:27] <mumbles> and bnc went into action :(
[06:27] <sain> J4kch, ok one sec ... i don't use bash
[06:27] <jrib> J4kch: no, you don't use $ with export
[06:27] <PiTcReW> nevermind
[06:27] <stekotzurivychps> is it possible that vnc seems faster than windows remote desktop to me?
[06:27] <sain> J4kch, yeah
[06:28] <mwalling> ompaul: its back. lathargic, but back
[06:28] <ompaul> J4kch, export http_proxy=http://your.proxy.whatever:PORT_NUMBER
[06:28] <ks3> Tigerman, okay, how about mke2fs -F -n /dev/hdc1 (or whichever partition on hdc...)
[06:28] <jrib> J4kch: export http_proxy="" && echo $http_proxy       this should work
[06:28] <sindrum> pitcrew:ill try
[06:28] <ompaul> J4kch, also export ftp_proxy=http://your.proxy.whatever:PORT_NUMBER   (if it does the ftp also)
[06:28] <sain> ompaul, we want to get rid of his proxy setting
[06:28] <Tigerman> ks3: ill try that..
[06:28] <sindrum> pitcrew:what are you using to play them with
[06:29] <mateusz> hi
[06:29] <ompaul> sain, from? web browser or apt?
[06:29] <J4kch> jrib: it appears blank
[06:29] <justin_> Why does my "add/remove" programs always tell me my list is out of date no matter how many times I reload or update it? -- and even update apt- it still tells me this
[06:29] <jrib> J4kch: great, that's what we want right?
[06:29] <sain> J4kch, now try
[06:29] <Sikavica> How can I make rsh trusting my localhost? (putting localhost in .rhost, doesn't seem to work)
[06:29] <sain> ompaul, apt ... it was using the proxy
[06:29] <J4kch> jrib: still can't get the updates
[06:30] <ompaul> sain, very easy in synaptic
[06:30] <jrib> J4kch: are you doing 'sudo aptitude update' in the same terminal?
[06:30] <sain> ompaul, than talk him through it ... i don't run ubuntu :)
[06:30] <Tigerman> ks3: that got me a superblock list, yeah
[06:30] <ompaul> sain, seems he is getting enough help
[06:30] <ks3> Tigerman, excellent
[06:30] <sain> ompaul, only noticed his problem was that he was connecting to a proxy running on his local machine
[06:30] <J4kch> jrib: Not using terminal at all
[06:31] <Tigerman> ks3: 14 of them.. now i just need to hope one of them works?
[06:31] <jrib> J4kch: right, that variable was only reset in the terminal you issued that export command
[06:31] <salkot> justin_, maybe the date on your computer is wrong?
[06:31] <PiTcReW> hmm
[06:31] <PiTcReW> how do i change my screen resolution to 1440x900??
[06:31] <PiTcReW> its not in the list of resolutions
[06:31] <J4kch> jrib: Ohhh, I see what you did there
[06:32] <ks3> Tigerman, yep, one of them should be good
[06:32] <Tigerman> is there anyone more likely than the other ones?
[06:32] <J4kch> jrib: Alright, got the updates but Synaptic still won't work
[06:33] <ompaul> J4kch, are you in a terminal?
[06:33] <ks3> Tigerman, you could start with the last one, but it's hard to say...
[06:33] <J4kch> ompaul: yes
[06:33] <jrib> J4kch: ok, because outside your terminal http_proxy is still set to localhost:4001.  You have to find out what is setting it to that
[06:33] <Tigerman> i started with the 2nd to last :p
[06:33] <ompaul> J4kch, have you got synaptic open?
[06:33] <J4kch> jrib: alright
[06:33] <sain> J4kch, also until you find out what's setting up the proxy, you should put the export http_proxy="" in your $HOME/.bashrc
[06:33] <J4kch> ompaul: yes

[06:39] <HumanPrototype> has anybody here tried customizing the ubuntu install cd?
[06:39] <J4kch> ompaul: launched
[06:40] <ompaul> J4kch, click settings -> network  and choose direct conneciton to internet
[06:40] <ompaul> J4kch, THEN choose apply

[06:40] <jrib> J4kch, sain, ompaul: http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=310& seems familiar
[06:41] <sain> ompaul, he says he was using JAP proxy, and uninstalled it. For some reason it is still trying to use the proxy ...
[06:41] <ompaul> J4kch, now with that all okay and saved and whatever - click reload
[06:41] <bxnp> could somebody confirm that www.gnome-look.org is down
[06:41] <ompaul> sain, well he should not be pointing at it now :)
[06:41] <bobbyshafter> I am in the process of installing edgy in a dual boot . I disconnected my primary which has xp on it ,my bios will not boot with my seconary set as slave ,i remove the jumper now i can boot from the edgy cd. Will i be able to reconnect both drives has there are ,select which os useing my bios
[06:41] <J4kch> ompaul: cannot download all repository indexes
[06:42] <sain> ompaul, yes, 'shouldn't be', but is ... maybe not purged
[06:43] <HumanPrototype> has anybody here tried customizing the ubuntu install cd?
[06:43] <ompaul> sain, well his software should not be using it now if he has done what I said
[06:43] <sain> jrib, yeah, that looks right
[06:43] <ompaul> HumanPrototype, there is something on the wiki and there is gnewsense
[06:44] <sain> J4kch, so you've done "apt-get --purge remove anon-proxy"
[06:44] <lumpki> bxnp, it's not responding
[06:44] <ompaul> HumanPrototype, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/Dapper

[06:44] <ompaul> sain, that was the gui thing I just did :)
[06:44] <justin_> :/
[06:44] <ks3> Tigerman, if there are lots of file system errors (which there very likely are if the superblock is corrupt)
[06:44] <sain> ompaul, ah ok, i'll leave it in your capable hands
[06:45] <sain> ompaul, just his $http_proxy keeps getting set back to localhost ....
[06:45] <J4kch> sain: It's uninstalled

[06:45] <bxnp> there are rumors that the site is hacked
[06:45] <jamesbrose> It doesn't work for me.
[06:45] <Zaggynl> Hi, I've found this nice app on freshmeat, and I made a .deb file out of it, where can I propose to let this be added in the repository?
[06:45] <justin_> When VLC starts like.. skipping frames what could it be? - I know it is not the video because it does not skip on otehr machines, and I did a fresh reboot?
[06:45] <dcordes> how can i resume files in firefox?
[06:45] <ompaul> sain, I think what happened is that sudo apt-get remove --purge packagename was not doen
[06:45] <justin_> dcordes: you can't
[06:45] <ompaul> done that is
[06:46] <dcordes> justin_: no way?
[06:46] <justin_> dcordes: You only can in Opera by default, im sure there is a firefox extension for it
[06:46] <ompaul> justin_, it could be DMA
[06:46] <justin_> ompaul: You think? ..
[06:46] <ompaul> justin_, I know :)
[06:46] <J4kch> ompaul, sain: "Package anon-proxy is not installed so not removed"
[06:46] <ompaul> justin_, that is a 99% case
[06:46] <justin_> ompaul: Haha strange because it did not do it in Xubuntu, only does it in Ubuntu..
[06:46] <nothlit> dcordes, there are tons of download manager extensions in firefox
[06:46] <justin_> ompaul: Hrmm, have any quick solutions?
[06:47] <nothlit> for firefox*
[06:47] <sain> ompaul, yeah ... not being on ubuntu, how does he know make sure all the anon-proxy files are purged?
[06:47] <justin_> ohhh...
[06:47] <bobbyshafter> any help on yhe dual boot
[06:47] <sain> J4kch, yeah, it may be that when you removed it you didn't use the 'purge' argument, so didn't remove all the files
[06:47] <sindrum> dcordes you need the plugin
[06:47] <justin_> Maybe it will run fine in Flux :) -- I forgot Gnome uses more ram default then XFCE hehe.
[06:47] <justin_> let me go try that
[06:47] <ompaul> J4kch, but you did not did purge it first time out - you can reinstall and put it in again but just check now with the reload if it gets the files good if not then you might try a reinstall and a --purge
[06:47] <J4kch> sain: so I'd have to reinstall and purge?
[06:47] <Tigerman> ks3: "good"
[06:47] <J4kch> ompaul: mkay
[06:47] <nothlit> bobbyshafter, the desktop cd should automatically set that up for you with xp/ubuntu
[06:48] <sindrum> it use to be default but has changed
[06:48] <Tigerman> cause... i just had 2-3k errors :p
[06:48] <nothlit> bobbyshafter, if you have more than one linux  installation you'll have to edit grub
[06:49] <ompaul> J4kch, and note that you can't do sudo apt-get update and have synaptic open at the same time
[06:49] <wceoscar> what would be a good audio player?
[06:49] <ompaul> wceoscar, the default one, or xmms or whatever you like
[06:49] <wceoscar> ok
[06:49] <fuci> Why can't I change my resolution? It's in my xorg.conf file but it doesn't appear in the list in which you would normally change the resolution. I'm using Xubuntu.
[06:49] <bobbyshafter> hey i am using 2 drives and will boot from bios
[06:49] <J4kch> ompaul: I know that =P
[06:49] <sain> wceoscar, i like xmms
[06:50] <ompaul> !resolution | fuci

[06:50] <HumanPrototype> ompaul, thanks - i had found the wiki page but i will look in to gnewsense
[06:50] <HumanPrototype> does anybody know what the rules are about using artwork deriving from the ubuntu logos for another project?
[06:50] <ompaul> J4kch, please understand, I don't know what you do or don't know, so I have to assumesomething
[06:51] <ompaul> HumanPrototype, you should not - as they are trademarks
[06:51] <J4kch> ompaul: true
[06:51] <sain> and it's mostly safe to assume you know nothing .... nothing!
[06:51] <sain> ;)
[06:51] <HumanPrototype> ompaul, so how are they used for things like nubuntu and xubuntu
[06:51] <sindrum> funci:you can reconfigure and select which resoulutions you can use
[06:51] <storkme> is it possible to install ubuntu server edition with the 6.06 install CD ? if so how
[06:52] <ompaul> HumanPrototype, they are part of the "ubuntu family" and approval was sought from canonical
[06:52] <fuci> sindrum: I did that, and after I did it. It doesn't work anymore.
[06:52] <Tigerman> ks3: now, if none of the superblocks will give me any good results, is that when i start crying, or is there a way to create a fresh, working, superblock?
[06:52] <grunt121-d8> hello?
[06:52] <wceoscar> where can i get the last xmms for ubuntu?
[06:52] <ks3> Tigerman, no way that I know of, short of reformmating the partition.... but that's no good...
[06:52] <J4kch> ompaul: I purged, but > echo $http_proxy < still shows localhost
[06:52] <sindrum> funci:dpkg-recofigure xserver-xorg
[06:52] <grunt121-d8> umm can sum 1 help me?
[06:52] <lumpki> fuci, did you restart X?
[06:52] <Tigerman> ks3: as i said.. "start crying" aka reformatting :p
[06:53] <fuci> lumpki: I did.
[06:53] <ks3> Tigerman, but if using one of the alternates started checking and came up with errors, it may be fixable
[06:53] <sindrum> funci:try that leaving everything as is except the resoulution
[06:53] <ks3> Tigerman, albeit, some data would be lost
[06:53] <ompaul> J4kch, reboot and see if it is there,
[06:53] <HumanPrototype> ompaul, ok, thanks
[06:53] <fuci> Well, doesn't hurt to try again. :p
[06:53] <fuci> Brb.
[06:53] <J4kch> ompaul: It also said "directory /var/run/anon-proxy not empty so not removed"
[06:53] <HumanPrototype> ompaul, how would I go about obtaining approval for a similar project?
[06:53] <sain> J4kch, doh, i assumed you rebooted :)
[06:53] <lumpki> wceoscar, use synaptic
[06:53] <grunt121-d8> sum 1 help me?
[06:53] <Tigerman> ks3: if i have to reformat the partition, all data will be lost as there is only one :p
[06:53] <ompaul> HumanPrototype, read the ubuntu website on trademarks
[06:53] <sain> J4kch, lol it's still running
[06:54] <lumpki> what is your question grunt121-d8?
[06:54] <ks3> Tigerman, well, yes
[06:54] <wceoscar> in synaptic it shows me like 100 files with xmms
[06:54] <marcin_ant> !raid
[06:54] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[06:54] <ks3> Tigerman, but, you can try fsck -b <alternate superblock> -y /dev/hdc1
[06:54] <grunt121-d8> i have doom 3 and i wanna know how to record a AVI demo
[06:54] <Tigerman> -y is? same as -p?
[06:54] <lumpki> wceoscar, just install 'xmms' and it will grab anything else it needs
[06:54] <HumanPrototype> storkme, not that I know of
[06:54] <ks3> Tigerman, the fsck -p option tries to safely prune the file system...  -y tells it to assume yes to all questions
[06:54] <fuci> Didn not work :/
[06:54] <wceoscar> ok
[06:55] <sindrum> funci:dont forget to reboot
[06:55] <stoorty> how do i get apt-get to work? it says it cannot open the lock file??
[06:55] <stoorty> !apt-get
[06:55] <ubotu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[06:55] <ks3> Tigerman, slightly different, if i remember correctly... -y doesn't care about saving data, just getting the file system mountable (more or less)
[06:55] <Tigerman> hmm.. -p in the description says auto repair tho..
[06:55] <lumpki> stoorty, use sudo apt-get ...
[06:55] <MattJ> How do I change the TTY X runs on?
[06:55] <Launchpad-Lap> hey guys is there an irc client for 64bit ubuntu?
[06:55] <stoorty> still get the xsame error lumpki
[06:55] <ck3> grunt121-d8: http://vnc2swf.sourceforge.net
[06:55] <lumpki> stoorty, close synaptic
[06:56] <lumpki> =D
[06:56] <sain> J4kch, you sure anon-proxy is stopped?
[06:56] <Tigerman> anyways.. ill try -y instead.. still got 12 superblocks to hope for a result with :p
[06:56] <ck3>  is the http://us.archive.ubuntu.com mirror having issues?
[06:56] <stoorty> it is closed, i already done that lumpki
[06:56] <ompaul> sain, there is the most obvious one :-)
[06:56] <gop> !usb flash
[06:56] <HumanPrototype> stoorty, you cannot run apt-get twice at the same time so you cant have the update manager, synaptic, apt-get or aptitude going when you try and open one of them

[06:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about usb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:56] <gop> I got one question
[06:57] <ks3> Tigerman, good luck
[06:57] <ompaul> sain, get progam "bum" installed and use it to turn off that proxy item simple gui for daemon management
[06:57] <gop> is thier a version of ubuntu, or linux that boots from a usb flash disk
[06:57] <gop> 2 gig or one gig
[06:57] <stoorty> i only have the one terminal open and i was trying to apt get ntfs-3g but i get the lock error
[06:57] <ompaul> sain, I must depart

[06:57] <Tigerman> ks3: thanks, it appears ill need it :p
[06:57] <ompaul> l8r
[06:57] <sain> J4kch, get progam "bum" installed and use it to turn off that proxy item simple gui for daemon management
[06:57] <J4kch> well, I'm rebooting
[06:57] <gop> any here know, of a distro that support booting from usb
[06:57] <sain> J4kch, from ompaul
[06:57] <kitche> gop: dsl, slax is two
[06:57] <sain> J4kch, one sec
[06:57] <J4kch> sain: aight
[06:58] <fuci> Hmm, my system doesn't seem to go higher than 1280x960, normally I'd use 1280x1024
[06:58] <sain> J4kch, is there a anon-proxy.pid or similar in /var/run?
[06:58] <gop> oh kitche does it work like live, cd, as in after reboot I lose my infomation, kitche or it stores my information
[06:58] <gop> information
[06:58] <J4kch> sain: how do I check again? I forget
[06:58] <sindrum> funci:im not sure then...
[06:58] <sain> J4kch, ls /var/run in terminal
[06:59] <Lovloss> WEhenever I boot up it says my disk has errors i have to manually repair, and puts me in this shell.
[06:59] <J4kch> sain: right, well there is no .pid but there is anon-proxy
[06:59] <sain> J4kch, well reboot and see if it is still there
[06:59] <sain> J4kch, you should be ok
[06:59] <justin_> Well VLC works fine in Fluxbox.. so hmm I guess this :DMA: issue only occurs in Gnome ompaul ?
[06:59] <J4kch> sain: aight
[06:59] <fuci> All my fonts are messed up, this sucks :(
[06:59] <justin_> fuci: Go to preferences -> fonts
[07:00] <wceoscar> i just got XMMS but the volume doesnt works... it i try to lower it it wont...
[07:00] <justin_> wceoscar: Most likely another app has locked the sound controls.
[07:00] <Lovloss> is there a way to fsck my sda2? i cant really unmount it
[07:00] <sain> wceoscar, there is a setting in options for what mixer channel controls the volume
[07:00] <Lovloss> its my big data partition
[07:00] <justin_> You need to close the other app.. video player or even a flash vid, restart XMMS.
[07:01] <Lovloss> says /dev/sda2: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
[07:01] <tryxter> hi everyone. i'm trying to install a D-Link DWL-G122 wlan usb stick for hours and still nothing. Can anyone give me an article or explain to me how to install it using WPA? please?
[07:01] <lumpki> stoorty, i think some other apt process must be running
[07:01] <tryxter> (i'm kind of a ubuntu newbie)
[07:01] <ademan> rather than using damn small linux or puppy linux, would it be possible for me to use gentoo to make my own minimal desktop, and then turn it into an ISO and then put it on a bootable thumbdrive?
[07:01] <justin_> By the way.. if your on big speakers you might want to change your XMMS options to OSS rather then Alsa, and click "master volume" controls.
[07:01] <wceoscar> What setting?
[07:01] <sain> ademan, it would be possible, but not reasonable
[07:02] <justin_> OSS sounds way better on big speakers :) -- especially for rock, Alsa works better for hiphop/dance/techno for some odd reason
[07:02] <ademan> sain: why not?
[07:02] <alecjw> ive got twinview working, but it's treating my CRT as the defualt display, wheras i want my DFP to be treated as defualt. how do i do this?
[07:02] <Lovloss> lets try this: is there any way for me to exit everything and get to the shell in such a way that i can dismount sda2 without my computer rebooting?
[07:02] <Lovloss> would umount -a work?
[07:02] <wceoscar> sain, whats that setting?
[07:02] <yannick_> "modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-amd64-generic/modules.dep: No such file or directory" using dapper. Does someone has ever seen such thing?
[07:03] <sain> wceoscar, options->preferences Then configure the output plugin under the Audio I/O plugins tab
[07:03] <Zehrila> God, why doesn't ubuntu come with a decent dial-up client? :(
[07:03] <Zehrila> How is one supposed to download one when one can't even connect?
[07:03] <kitche> Lovloss: do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop that will stop X and take you to the console
[07:03] <sain> ademan, because of the work involved, and the fact that gentoo like to build from source
[07:03] <fuci> The resolution & font problem is only when I log in with XFCE session, Gnome works fine.
[07:03] <sain> ademan, what do you have against damn small etc?
[07:04] <tryxter> can someone help me configuring my DWL-G122 stick? please!
[07:04] <justin_> Zehrila: Because most people are on broadband..
[07:04] <wceoscar> sain, there is no output plugin in the list...
[07:04] <justin_> Same reason Ubuntu does not ship with tons of DEV stuff, since most DEV's probably will not be using Ubuntu
[07:04] <sain> wceoscar, well that could be a problem :)
[07:04] <kitche> Zehrila: linux has a dial-up program go into networking and its the ppp connection
[07:04] <wceoscar> sain, i just found it
[07:04] <ademan> sain: i dunno i just kinda wanted to get newer releases of the involved software
[07:05] <lumpki> justin_, 50% of people still use dialup
[07:05] <wceoscar> sain, just fixed it
[07:05] <Zehrila> kitche: Ubuntu doesn't seem to have it.
[07:05] <sain> wceoscar, well then crank that puppy up
[07:05] <Zehrila> And justin_, isn't ubuntu the linux for everyone rather than for just those on broadband?
[07:05] <rummik> i just installed camorama and when it comes up it says it cannot connect to the video device (/dev/video0) however, lsmod says "videodev               11456  1 spca5xx" spca5xx is the module for my camera
[07:05] <wceoscar> i will ;)
[07:05] <sain> ademan, if it's any help, i did the same thing but with freebsd
[07:05] <wceoscar> hey
[07:05] <justin_> lumpki: Where ?
[07:05] <justin_> wow..
[07:06] <lumpki> everywhere
[07:06] <kitche> Zehrila: sure it does I m looking at mine right now, it should show a phone symbol next to it in the networking part it's under System -> networking
[07:06] <justin_> Why dial-up is almost as expensive as broadband
[07:06] <wceoscar> I Have like 39 of unallocated space... how can i partition it with ntfs or fat32???
[07:06] <wceoscar> 39gigs
[07:06] <lumpki> broadband is not available everywhere
[07:06] <defrysk> Zehrila, system > administration > networking
[07:06] <sain> wceoscar, well first, i'd recommend formatting with fat32 if you want windows interoperability
[07:07] <Zehrila> kitche: The one which you have to check/uncheck to enable/disable? If you're referring to that one, it does nothing for me when I check/uncheck even after enabling it in its properties.
[07:07] <ademan> sain: well alright thanks, at least i know its possible, now i just need to decide if that's what i want to do.  (In addition to wanting to have newer versions of things, i want a few extra programs i know are NOT bundled with dsl)
[07:07] <J4kch> Hey guys
[07:07] <J4kch> What's up?
[07:07] <kitche> !dialup|Zehrila

[07:08] <sain> ademan, yeah, and remember you'll have to either compile the progs on the usb stick, or elsewhere then put the binaries and dependencies on the stick
[07:08] <Zehrila> BTW is there a way for me to download gnome-ppp while using windows and then install it from ubuntu? I've got one multiboot system.
[07:08] <sain> J4kch, so?
[07:08] <wceoscar> sain, i know that.. im sharing the space with windows... how can i partition the drive with fat?
[07:08] <Zehrila> gnome-ppp doesn't seem to be included with the gnome packages provided on CD.
[07:08] <J4kch> sain: Don't rush me! =P
[07:08] <sain> J4kch, lol
[07:08] <J4kch> sain: Echo looks fine
[07:09] <errorlevel> Zehrila: Yes.  Go on http://packages.ubuntu.com and find the .deb file.  Make sure you grab the dependencies if you need them.  Then you can install them from within ubuntu using dpkg -i filename.deb or dpkg -i filename1.deb filename2.deb ...
[07:09] <tryxter> ** dwl
[07:09] <sain> wceoscar, well you could use the install disk, would be easiest
[07:09] <J4kch> sain: anon-proxy is gone from /var/run
[07:09] <manmadha> hee when ever i delete certain files ..... *.*~ is forming.....What is the meaning of this...?
[07:09] <wceoscar> ok
[07:09] <sain> J4kch, cool, how about the ole update?
[07:10] <J4kch> sain: It's working!
[07:10] <J4kch> sain: I love you man, you and jrib and ompaul...

[07:10] <Lapfunc> hi.  i installed enigma, and it changed my resolution down.  now that i've exited, it didn't change the resolution back up, and i can't seem to change it through system->administration.  the desktop is still 1024x768, but the screen is something like 640x480, and i have to move the mouse to the edge of the screen to scroll it

[07:24] <princemackenzie> sain, alright
[07:24] <zach635> gl hf, going back to osx ^^
[07:25] <wceoscar> when i enter the shell ctrl+alt+F1 the fonts there seem to be laggy and taller than wider... cani change the res or resolve this prob?
[07:26] <manmadha> wceoscar, it is closing its x-windows
[07:26] <manmadha> may be
[07:26] <manmadha> sorry
[07:27] <sain> wceoscar, you mean your console fonts?
[07:27] <wceoscar> the shell works properly the problem is how the characters are dsplayed... the fonts look taller than wider
[07:27] <sain> wceoscar, i think there is a console-tools package or similar that helps to tweak such things
=== driv[brb]  is now known as drivera90
[07:27] <wceoscar> YEs.. the console FONTS
[07:27] <Jahman> hi
[07:28] <wceoscar> how can i fix that???? it looks like crap
[07:29] <Raven> anybody got any good Ubuntu wallpapers
[07:29] <sain> you'll have to google, or get someone else to tell you ... i'm on another system
[07:29] <princemackenzie> Raven, ubuntu specific or good wallpaper in general
[07:29] <sain> wceoscar, try console-tools maybe
[07:29] <Raven> good wallpaper and Ubuntu
[07:30] <wceoscar> wheres that locates sain?
[07:30] <princemackenzie> Raven, www.interfacelift.com has excellent wallpaper
[07:30] <wubrgamer> hey guys
[07:30] <wubrgamer> quick poll
[07:30] <Vorbote> wceoscar: have you already tried to reconfigure the console-tools package?
[07:30] <sain> wceoscar, dunno, but it's around
[07:30] <wceoscar> nope
[07:30] <princemackenzie> Raven, for ubuntu, you can poke around the gallery on the forums, www.ubuntuforums.org
[07:30] <wubrgamer> what IRC client are you using ?
[07:30] <christian1222> Hi Guys, I just installed Ubuntu 6.06 on my computer in a protest against windows and proprietary software. Does anyone know of a good book for beginners with some cmputer knowledge, but none fo linux?
[07:30] <princemackenzie> wubrgamer, XChat
[07:30] <sain> wubrgamer, just reading raw packets
[07:31] <linux_kid> wubrgamer: Xchat
[07:31] <sain> wubrgamer, with tcpdump
[07:31] <princemackenzie> sain, lmao
[07:31] <Vorbote> wceoscar: Hmmm.. that would be console-setup instead (things have changed a bit lately).
[07:31] <wceoscar> vorbe, where is that setting located?
[07:31] <Raven> Cheers m8, some good stuff on their
[07:31] <sain> wceoscar, ah, follow Vorbote's advice ... not mine :)
[07:32] <linux_kid> Anyone here know how to install pictosniff? (it reads Nintendo DS pictochat chatrooms)
[07:32] <sain> hmm wubgamer went to investigate tcpdump as an IRC client
[07:32] <hexdream> Where do I find the FAQ/usage guidlines for #ubuntu
[07:32] <sain> hexdream, you actually want to read them?
[07:32] <nothlit> why would people sniff pictochat
[07:33] <hou5ton> How can I set smb4k so that I can open it as user, instead of having to be root?
[07:33] <linux_kid> nothlit: because they have no better use of time...
[07:33] <helpme> hello
[07:33] <hexdream> never hurts ;-) actually they can hurt. Just want to make sure I dont step on any toes.
[07:33] <helpme> Hi guys! How are you guys doing?
[07:33] <sk0r`> hello all
[07:33] <sain> hexdream, i think the only rule is; don't make Seveas angry
[07:33] <nothlit> christian1222, theres an official ubuntu book, if not oreilly has tons of great educational books and theres a book for mepis thats supposed to be pretty good
[07:33] <sk0r`> just stopping by to say ubuntu rocks my face off
[07:34] <Seveas> sk0r`, doesn't that hurt?
[07:34] <ademan> gparted won't let me format a usb disk, is that supposed to be that way?
[07:34] <sain> sk0r`, missing faces are covered in #noface-ubuntu
[07:34] <hexdream> fair enough. different people anger in different ways.
[07:34] <wceoscar> vorbote, where is that console stting at?
[07:34] <Vorbote> wceoscar: A small beginers hint: Open synaptic, search for the package click on its name and select configure package (somewhere in the menus). Or open a terminal emulator and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup". I find the latter easier but many are afraid of the command line...
[07:34] <helpme> I need some help with GRUB
[07:34] <sain> helpme, lay it on me
[07:34] <helpme> thank you sain.
[07:35] <nothlit> synaptic has a tie-in to dpkg-reconfigure?
[07:35] <Vorbote> nothlit: yes
[07:35] <sk0r`> :D
[07:35] <sain> helpme, oh, i wouldn't be doing the thanking yet
[07:35] <sain> synaptic is a front-end to dpkg/apt
[07:35] <helpme> We (me and a friend) have installed Ubuntu Daper on his comp.
[07:35] <nothlit> =/ why can't synaptic use aptitude then
[07:35] <sain> so yeah, a bit of a tie in ;)
[07:35] <Magusknight> how do i run a shellscript
[07:35] <sain> aptitude is different
[07:35] <helpme> After installing, there was no GRUB.
[07:36] <helpme> so, SInce from the beguining ther ewas no grub, I don't know what to do. I can't use "restore grub"
[07:36] <nothlit> sain, yeah it uses apt-get (and apt-cache?) but i didn't know it ties into dpkg-reconfigure
[07:36] <sain> helpme, so you can't boot up?
[07:36] <helpme> We can only boot Ubuntu
[07:36] <helpme> but, he also has WIndows OS on it
[07:36] <nothlit> helpme, use the alternate install cd, super grub disk, or regular grub disk
[07:36] <nothlit> you could always use loadlin
[07:36] <sain> helpme, you'll have to install grub again
[07:36] <wceoscar> vorbote, what should i select on encoding the console?
[07:36] <helpme> but, since ther eis no GRUB, we cannot choose which OS to run
[07:36] <slammm> ubuntu = teh best
[07:36] <slammm> XD
[07:36] <slammm> thanks guys
[07:37] <sain> helpme, but you say it will boot into ubuntu?
[07:37] <helpme> yes
[07:37] <helpme> it only boots Ubuntu
[07:37] <sain> helpme, if it does, boot into ubuntu then apt-get install grub
[07:37] <helpme> it dosn't display the Grub at all.
[07:37] <helpme> looks like grub wasn't isntalled
[07:37] <nothlit> sain, aptitude still can use install remove purge update upgrade dist-upgrade
[07:37] <helpme> ok. sudo aptitude install grub
[07:37] <slammm> ciao
[07:37] <kitche> helpme: do you see a ubuntu logo?
[07:38] <Vorbote> wceoscar: I supppose you Speak a western european language, thus utf-8 with iso-8859-15 translitaration is the default (and most appropriate setting).
[07:38] <LjL> sain: aptitude is also a frontend to dpkg/apt, it's just that it also does some backend-like stuff of its own...
[07:38] <J4kch> sain: I just downloaded this .mov file, it doesn't show properly on VLC, any suggestions?
[07:38] <sain> nothlit, yeah, aptitude is better as it removes uneeded dependencies, unlike apt ...
[07:38] <nothlit> helpme, grub is install, its just invisible unless you hit esc at the right time
[07:38] <Vorbote> s/tranlitaration/(transliteration/
[07:38] <craigp84> i've been tasked with deploying linux on a small network... what tools should i read up on to allow me to control desktop profiles - like GPO in windows?
[07:38] <sain> J4kch, mplayer?
[07:38] <syock> My computer can suspend and hibernate. If I suspend, I can have it wake-up by moving the mouse. While it can be convenient for some people, I don`t like it when it wakes up by itself when I accidentally bumped the desk. So I want to remap the wake-up trigger to just the sleep button on the keyboard.
[07:38] <nothlit> helpme, do gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:38] <sain> LjL, ok, i defer to your greater knowledge
[07:38] <kmasta> hey guys, when ever my computer come out of powersave mode, my internet connection doesn't work. When I try to shut it down I can't get the shut down menu to come up and I have to manual restart the computer
[07:38] <LjL> sain, i was just saying.
[07:38] <slammm> hey, how long will it take for delivery of cds?
[07:38] <sain> LjL, yeah, i wasn't being sarcastic
[07:39] <pr0cheater> hi
[07:39] <wceoscar> vorbote, i speak native american english
[07:39] <slammm> hey, how long will it take for delivery of cds?
[07:39] <wceoscar> is that iso-8859?
[07:39] <Vorbote> wceoscar: then don't touch the defaults.
[07:39] <kitche> slamm: depedns but it's 1-3 business weeks
[07:39] <Vorbote> wceoscar: do fiddle with the font settings there.

[07:40] <slammm> i live in the UK
[07:40] <LjL> sain: also BTW, on Edgy apt-get adds an unused-dependencies-auto-removal feature of its own. myself i've switched back to apt-get (though there are still some features that can be handy in aptitude, but i guess i never used them much...)
[07:40] <wceoscar> vorbote, then shoud i cancel that part or select utf?

[07:40] <sain> LjL, ah, good to know ... i have to confess i don't even use ubuntu ...
[07:41] <J4kch> sain: lol
[07:41] <sain> but i like to pretend i do, because of the hype :)
[07:42] <Magusknight> sain: so what do you use?
[07:42] <sain> Magusknight, oh no, this could get all nasty ;)
[07:42] <sain> freebsd
[07:42] <J4kch> sain: how do I get mplayer?
[07:42] <sain> but i install ubuntu for a lot of people
[07:42] <LjL> sain: well, perhaps the auto-removal feature will be backported to Debian as well, who knows... (well perhaps somebody does, just not me =)
[07:42] <boink> apt-get install mplayer, how else?
[07:42] <sain> J4kch, um apt-get install mplayer ?
[07:43] <Magusknight> sain: why?
[07:43] <bruenig> J4kch, sudo apt-get install mplayer, you need to enable the extra repos first
[07:43] <boink> you'll need the right codecs as well
[07:43] <boink> you should apt-get install the right codecs first
[07:43] <J4kch> package isn't available
[07:43] <kmasta> hey guys, my network connection keeps dropping when ever i come out of powersave mode, what's going on?
[07:43] <sain> Magusknight, many reasons, none of which should be elucidated on this channel
[07:43] <boink> then you need to adjust your /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:43] <bruenig> J4kch, could you pastebin your sources.list

[07:44] <sain> J4kch, you've got to add all the fun repositories to your sources.list
[07:44] <sain> J4kch, i'm sure there's an easy 'ubuntu way' to do it
[07:44] <hexdream> Does anybody know of a way to take the repository DVD's and run them off the hard disk (in a specific folder). Im sick of pushing & pulling disks.

[07:47] <nothlit> sain, how up to date are the ports?
[07:47] <J4kch> sain: I'd have to know which ones to add
[07:47] <bruenig> J4kch, first you probably should delete that breezy line if you are't using it
[07:47] <bruenig> J4kch, add this line at the top

[07:47] <nothlit> J4kch, system administration software sources
[07:47] <bruenig> J4kch, oh you will have to do sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list in order to edit
[07:48] <nothlit> bruenig, you can use the "software sources" app
[07:48] <zugu> hello
[07:48] <bruenig> nothlit, you can edit the sources.list
[07:48] <slop> how would i go about updating a link (libGL.so.1)?  i just want to replace it with a new copy that points to libGL.so.1.2
[07:49] <zugu> i'm having some problems with the tcp/ip ports: some bittorrent clients are reporting blocked ports on my system, however, there are applications using whatever ports they like
[07:49] <J4kch> bruenig, added
[07:49] <zugu> is there a centralised port management thing?
[07:49] <bruenig> J4kch, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mplayer
[07:49] <bruenig> zugu, I used firestarter to open bittorrent ports
[07:49] <nothlit> bruenig, you said pretend you don't know how to edit the sources.list file, so i was talking about the noob way
[07:49] <bruenig> zugu, sudo apt-get install firestarter, if you wish to try it
[07:50] <zugu> bruenig, thank you
[07:50] <hou5ton> I have a program, SMB4K, that I want to have always mount as root and do so automatically when I boot up. HOw do I do that?

[07:51] <J4kch> okay, I have mplayer now. Is there a way to get ALL of the codecs?
[07:52] <nothlit> bruenig, why would he need to install a firewall in order to open ports? i'm guessing he hasn't done anything with iptables

[07:52] <bruenig> nothlit, I didn't tell him to do so, I simply remarked that that is what I did to do so.
[07:52] <nothlit> zugu, are those other apps you installed thing like apache ssh or vnc?
[07:52] <J4kch> bruenig: danke
[07:53] <nothlit> zugu, or  just things like media players and browsers
[07:53] <bruenig> nothlit, iptables was maddening. Perhaps that is my incompetence but I generally am able to grasp things and that I was not.
[07:53] <zugu> nothlit, no, it's azureus, bittornado and utorrent under wine
[07:53] <nothlit> zugu, no "there are applications using whatever ports they like" ... what are these apps
[07:53] <zugu> nothlit, other apps, like amule, the default gnome torrent client or dc++ are able to freely use the ports
[07:54] <nothlit> zugu, that means you probably need to edit your router settings to open up 6881
[07:54] <nothlit> zugu, or its because you haven't opened it up tcp & udp
[07:54] <zugu> nothlit, what app is using that port?
[07:55] <helpme> there is no package grub in edgy
[07:55] <zugu> nothlit, tcp & udp are open, otherwise amule or dc++ would not function
[07:55] <helpme> sudo aptitude install grub, dosn't give anything
[07:55] <nothlit> zugu, things like the default torrent  client probably don't bother complaining about not being able to accept connections since it can still make them
[07:55] <nothlit> zugu, thats just the default torrent port
[07:55] <tonyyarusso> !info grub edgy
[07:55] <ubotu> grub: GRand Unified Bootloader. In component main, is optional. Version 0.97-11ubuntu14 (edgy), package size 359 kB, installed size 764 kB
[07:55] <nothlit> zugu, it'll depend on the app and the settings
[07:56] <tristam_> helpme, can you post the contents of /boot/grub/menu.lst please?
[07:56] <Dreetn> Hi guys
[07:56] <Dreetn> I have a prob with installing ubuntu
[07:56] <nothlit> zugu, explain how you internet (or possible lan) is setup
[07:56] <zugu> nothlit, the default gnome torrent client is set to randomly use ports between 10000 and 15000, and it's working properly, while azureus and utorrent say that they cannot use random ports, such as 12345
[07:56] <ernz> Hello, how do I "Add a repo"?
[07:57] <Dreetn> I have xp and I want to install ubuntu on another partition, so I set my 1th boot device on my disk station and I insert the disk with the .iso file
[07:57] <nothlit> zugu, like i said, its probably that the mainline client doesn't complain about either udp or receiving connections (in the server sense)
[07:57] <Dreetn> But then xp just starts...
[07:57] <stoorty> set it to boot from cd?
[07:58] <hexdream> have you tried the super grub disk. Saved my butt after a botched dual boot. http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org/
[07:58] <Dreetn> I did
[07:58] <stoorty> or use the libve cd and install from that
[07:58] <bruenig> zugu, I installed firestarter. Then just went to policy and opened the ports. Then configured utorrent to use those ports and it was good
[07:58] <Dreetn> ok
[07:58] <nothlit> zugu, downloading still works fine if you haven't set it up properly
[07:58] <ernz> !beryl
[07:58] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[07:58] <nothlit> zugu, because a client can still make connections
[07:59] <zugu> nothlit, they need to use random ports, because there are trackers that do not accept connections on the default torrent port
[07:59] <nothlit> zugu, but things like azureus and utorrent will complain because its one sided
[07:59] <bruenig> nothlit, yeah if you want to leech. If you are firewalled you cannot connect to other people who are firewalled. So if everyone was firewalled, bittorrent wouldn't work.
[07:59] <^FrIenD^> Ciao a TuTTi

[08:07] <J4kch> bruenig, it's also latest version that's the problemo
[08:07] <morisal2> mhgf
[08:07] <ernz> javaJake: So will beryl not work for me? What should I use instead?
[08:07] <kitche> ernz: you don't need XGL to run beryl but with the drivers that ubuntu uses you will probably need to use xGL sicne they are not the latest
[08:07] <bruenig> J4kch, what was the error and when did it show up, what command did you run before it showed up
[08:08] <bruenig> are the us repos down?

[08:35] <assasukasse> noone knows how to save a windows share password in keyring so that i am not asked every time i boot?
[08:35] <storkme> how do i check if a filesystem has errors on linux?
[08:35] <lumpki> Donald1, once you know the command, you can create a launcher in the menu or on the desktop
[08:35] <ArrenLex> storkme: fsck
[08:35] <salty-horse> hi. inwhich package can i find the glibc man pages? (it's not in glibc-doc)
[08:35] <storkme> assasukasse, can't you put it in /etc/fstab?
[08:35] <christian1222> ArrenLex: thanks
[08:35] <DARKGuy> Slart: Whenever you install some program or game, usually you just type the app/game's name the same way
[08:35] <Slart> Donald1: and if you know the command you can always do a "whereis freecraft" in console.. to find where it is
[08:36] <storkme> ArrenLex, fsck with which args
[08:36] <assasukasse> storkme i prefer to click on the share link on the desktop, but it asks me the windows admin password all the time, which i dont want..
[08:36] <Donald1> Slart: ok
[08:36] <ArrenLex> storkme: fsck /dev/<whatever>, as long as your filesystem is unmounted or mounted read-only.
[08:36] <storkme> assasukasse, share link? i don't have one of those
[08:36] <Slart> DARKGuy: yes, i know.
[08:37] <Slart> hmm.. my freecraft core dumped.. =/
[08:37] <storkme> ArrenLex, it wouldn't work - 'The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2 filesystem' :|
[08:37] <DARKGuy> oops.
[08:37] <ArrenLex> storkme: what type of filesystem is it?
[08:37] <drcode> hi all
[08:37] <storkme> ArrenLex, it was ext3 when i made it
[08:38] <assasukasse> storkme i have a link to my windows shared folder on my desktop...i made from connect to server
[08:38] <joseph> can anyone tell me how i would get a list of all of the available irc channels
[08:38] <ArrenLex> storkme: Should work. Try running "sudo fsck.ext3 /dev/<whatever>" directly
[08:38] <storkme> assasukasse, it might be wise to put the connect command in /etc/fstab and make it mount it every time you log in
[08:38] <ArrenLex> joseph: /list works for me.
[08:38] <assasukasse> storkme do u have a wiki or anything else for that?
[08:39] <storkme> ArrenLex, same error.. does it make a difference that i'm on a live cd ?
[08:39] <drcode> I have problem with pppconfig
[08:39] <Slart> ouch... my x gdm keeps restarting when I try to run games in full screen
[08:39] <drcode> I use modem
[08:39] <ArrenLex> storkme: You're trying to check a system on your hard drive from a live-cd? There shouldn't be any problems with that. Run "sudo fdisk -l" to make sure you're trying to check the correct filesystem, though.
[08:39] <drcode> is there support for HSF modem under linux?
[08:39] <storkme> assasukasse, try this: http://tinyurl.com/59oyc
[08:40] <Rambo3> storkme whats the error , i think you can run it only on live cd
[08:40] <drcode> I need to buy driver or I can use free driver?
[08:40] <joseph> thanks arren
[08:40] <Jassossovinik> I can gain access to a remote server via ssh. I want to backup a directory on that machine onto this machine, but I can't work out how to do it.  How should I go about this?
[08:40] <storkme> ArrenLex, apparently /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table which is my bad i think.. i guess that means i need to create one?
[08:40] <lumpki> drcode, it depends on the modem i think
[08:40] <drcode> I have pci connext
[08:40] <Slart> my resolution preferences thingy in ubuntu says I can only chose between 50Hz and 54Hz in horizontal refresh rate.. that cant be right.. how can I change it?
[08:40] <drcode> zoltrix modem
[08:40] <assasukasse> storkme thanks, do u have a clue how to make a touchscreen work?
[08:40] <joseph> exit
[08:41] <ArrenLex> storkme: o_O if it doesn't have a valid partition table, then there are no filesystems on it you can possibly check.
[08:41] <storkme> assasukasse, sorry buddy, no idea. google would be a good place to start
[08:41] <aleka> HOw do you verify the integrity of an iso file?
[08:41] <lumpki> drcode, did you check out linuxant.com?
[08:41] <Slart> aleka: check md5/crc32 if you know what they are supposed to be?
[08:42] <ompaul> Stork, don't say that, just say you don't know, if the word google is being used we give a full url targeted to solving the problem :)
[08:42] <storkme> ArrenLex, i used to use a 10gb hd for my OS but i just removed it.. so presumably i need to reformat the larger hd and include a partition table so it can be a valid filesystem?
[08:42] <assasukasse> storkme thanks anyway
[08:42] <J4kch> ompaul: Hey paul =)
[08:42] <ArrenLex> storkme: Oh. I would guess yes, then.
[08:42] <storkme> ompaul, hm, ok, sorry.
[08:42] <ompaul> J4kch, glad to see that worked
[08:42] <storkme> ArrenLex, do you know if it's possible to do that without formatting the hard drive?
[08:42] <ompaul> storkme, no worries
[08:42] <J4kch> ompaul: so am I
[08:42] <aleka> slart, this is to verify an edgy install iso actually..and the instructions on the wiki(burningiso HowTo) says it is outdated ( used a firefox extension to verify)
[08:43] <green_earz> aleka: dose the have md5sum file with it ? if so use md5sum to check the .iso against the md5sum file
[08:43] <ArrenLex> storkme: how do you mean "without formatting the hard drive"? Do you mean there's information on it you want to keep, despite there being no partition table?
=== Denton is now known as Denton_sk
[08:44] <Slart> aleka: doesn't the install CD have a "verify this cd" option when you boot from it? I might be thinking of debian though

[08:45] <drcode> I am now inside minicom
[08:45] <Slart> aleka: if you know the correct md5 you can just run "md5sum myimage.iso" in a terminal
[08:45] <ArrenLex> storkme: explain to me again how you managed to put information onto a drive with no partition table?
[08:45] <green_earz> aleka: as Slart said :  doesn't the install CD have a "verify this cd" option when you boot from it?
[08:45] <storkme> ArrenLex, no idea, ArrenLex.. i just used mkfs.ext3 on it when i bought it
[08:45] <drcode> is it recommanded to use mgetty or pon?
[08:45] <Slart> aleka: oh.. then you might have a disk error or something..
[08:45] <ArrenLex> storkme: That would make a partition table.
[08:46] <aleka> green_earz,  look at my response for slart please
[08:46] <storkme> ArrenLex, how come fdisk doesn't think i have one
[08:46] <drcode> for some reson pon say exept connect and it dosn't work
[08:46] <drcode> only minicom work
[08:46] <aleka> I am burning it on a different CD now just incase something went wrong while burning the other one
[08:46] <ArrenLex> storkme: I have no idea.
[08:46] <drcode> or recommanded to use mgetty with ppp?
[08:46] <J4kch> green_earz: how do I start bit tornado?
[08:46] <Paavo> Of course it is possible to make a filesystem on a drive with no partition table. Just write to the whole device.
[08:47] <Donald1> hello, how do I enable the "rendering" to play games correctly?
[08:47] <Slart> aleka: if you're getting read errors on the iso I dont think burning again will help.. perhaps download again to a different location and then burn from the new file will help
[08:47] <Rambo3> that doesnt make sence
[08:47] <ArrenLex> storkme: OHH, pavoo has a good point. Can you please pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l?
[08:48] <Donald1> hello, how do I enable the "rendering" to play games correctly?

[08:48] <Slart> Donald1: what video card do you have?
[08:48] <strabes> Donald1: you have to install your video card drivers?
[08:48] <ServerCrash> i might sound crazy, but can anyone tell me what difference does distro make, like why fedora or why ubuntu or for that matter suse when almost all of them are same linux
[08:48] <Donald1> strabes: i have installed the drivers
[08:48] <green_earz> J4kch: sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui   then :  /usr/bin/btdownloadgui
[08:48] <storkme> ArrenLex, Paavo, one second
[08:48] <J4kch> ServerCrash: You sond crazy
[08:48] <ServerCrash> you get almost all the same stuff
[08:48] <Donald1> Slart: i have an ATI x300
[08:48] <aleka> Slart, hmm..2 cds wasted.. but do you know of any Ubuntu download mirror that also has an md5 with it?
[08:48] <ernz> Is anyone able to help me getting beryl to work? I used the walkthrough and its all gone tits up. Now the title bars from all my windows are missing and beryl isn't actually working still.
[08:48] <strabes> Donald1: what kind of card do you have?
[08:48] <ServerCrash> J4kch,  i said i might sound crazy
[08:48] <J4kch> green_earz: oh, thanks
[08:49] <ArrenLex> ServerCrash: package management system, package availability, user community, goals and objectives.
[08:49] <Donald1> strabes: ATI X300
[08:49] <green_earz> np
[08:49] <Slart> Donald1: there are some ATI drivers you can download using synaptec... have you done that?
[08:49] <lumpki> ServerCrash, yup. distro is mostly just a personal preference
[08:49] <strabes> Donald1: h/o
[08:49] <strabes> ernz: wiki.beryl-project.org
[08:49] <Donald1> Slart: i have downloaded the drivers with the synaptics
[08:49] <Slart> aleka: nope.. check the ubuntu main site for mirrors
[08:49] <ernz> strabes: I did the walkthrough from there, and it doesn't work at all
[08:49] <ArrenLex> Donald1: I have that. It's hell. fglrx locks up my system and r300 only gets 90 fps on glxgears. You're going to have a lot of trouble.
[08:49] <Subhuman> ServerCrash, the only thing in common is linux - which is just the kernel - you can comapre the kernel to the engine in a car - 10 cars might have the same engine - but they can be totally different cars
[08:50] <Donald1> ArrenLex: mmm, that's reassuring...
[08:50] <LIBe> too hard find wireless network...
[08:50] <strabes> Donald1: did you install fglrx? your card isn't supported by the open source driver
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Donald1: Innit? :)
[08:50] <ServerCrash> i have been using redhat/ fedora from long time but had heard a lot about ubuntu so wondering should i switch and if yes than what differece would i get in ubuntu
[08:50] <ArrenLex> strabes: Yes it is.
[08:50] <Slart> Donald1: ok.. I'm not up to date on ATI drivers.. but check the forums.. there should be plenty of threads about installing ati drivers and enabling hardware rendering and such
[08:50] <nothlit> ServerCrash, things like proprietary stuff, ease of use,hardware support, plug and play , as well
[08:50] <Donald1> Slart: ok, i'll go take a peak
[08:50] <J4kch> ServerCrash: Ubuntu is more user-friendly imho
[08:50] <storkme> ArrenLex, Paavo, http://rafb.net/paste/results/5ufBwt35.html
[08:50] <Slart> I'm there trying to get my nvidia card working =)
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Donald1: Go into /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change your video card driver to "radeon". Then try your game.
[08:50] <ServerCrash> Subhuman, Open office is same so is xine or firefox ...on all the flav of linux
[08:51] <strabes> ArrenLex: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto - X300 isn't supported by the open source ati driver
[08:51] <Subhuman> ServerCrash, okay - for example the way you install all of them is different
[08:51] <nothlit> ServerCrash, Subhuman, the kernel can be compiled with as many or as few options as you'd like so there exists a difference there as well
[08:51] <g0tw00d> can someone tell my Ubuntu locks my USB mouse up ever 15 minutes or so....I have to unplug it then replug it back in.....
[08:51] <Donald1> ArrenLex: it doesnt find the command :s
[08:51] <Subhuman> in ubuntu - since it uses apt - its VERY easy to install a big package like OO - in fedora or anything RPM based - its more difficult as you have to find the other programs OO needs yourself.
[08:51] <storkme> g0tw00d, anything useful from dmesg?
[08:51] <strabes> Donald1: I would recommend that you use fglrx for your specific card
[08:51] <ServerCrash> Subhuman, so is yum in fedora
[08:52] <nothlit> Subhuman, no they have yum synaptic and apt-get
[08:52] <Subhuman> yum is nowhere as near as good as apt though.
[08:52] <g0tw00d> im new to ubuntu....i have no idea what you said :)
[08:52] <strabes> Donald1: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[08:52] <aleka> Slart, thanks.. i got it here http://www.gtlib.gatech.edu/pub/ubuntu-releases/edgy/MD5SUMS>> and the MD5 matches with what I am getting on the iso I downloaded... don know what went wrong
[08:52] <nothlit> apt-get/synaptic exists from rpm based systems
[08:52] <Donald1> strabes: how do i use fglrx? and, moreover, what is it? :)
[08:52] <Subhuman> g0tw00d, type "dmesg" in a console
[08:52] <Subhuman> nothlit, exactly
[08:52] <Subhuman> their copying the best system :D
[08:52] <g0tw00d> ok hold on sec... :)
[08:52] <Subhuman> but thats the beauty of linux
[08:52] <Subhuman> go install suse
[08:52] <Subhuman> and ubuntuy
[08:52] <Subhuman> check them out
[08:52] <strabes> Donald1: it's the closed-source ati driver. it's the only linux ati driver that supports your card
[08:52] <Subhuman> youll get a feel for what you like.
[08:52] <strabes> Donald1: go to the link that I pasted above
[08:53] <Donald1> strabes: yes
[08:53] <g0tw00d> ok
[08:53] <storkme> any ideas ArrenLex Paavo ?
[08:53] <Subhuman> ive tried tons of distros before i settled on ubuntu ServerCrash - in fact i used suse for months before i found debian.
[08:53] <SARA> Can someone tell me how to upgrade my firefox when using my terminal
[08:53] <Slart> aleka: internet goblins..  I blame all strange things on them =)
[08:53] <nothlit> SARA sudo aptitude install firefox
[08:54] <strabes> SARA: firefox 2.0 comes with edgy
[08:54] <aleka> :=).. Maybe I should try another download...
[08:54] <ArrenLex> strabes: Don't argue with me. I HAVE THE CARD.
[08:54] <ArrenLex> strabes: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35209/
[08:54] <g0tw00d> storkme: am I looking for something in this?  I see my mouse as an input device.
[08:54] <ArrenLex> strabes: YES IT DOES..
[08:54] <ArrenLex> -.
[08:54] <Rprp> Does someone k now how i can 'grep' a word in all the files in a dir?
[08:54] <LIBe> plz somebody help me ToT
[08:54] <ServerCrash> Subhuman, i am fedora 5 now planning to go to 6 or ubuntu...so was seeking some guidance which way to move
[08:54] <lumpki> ServerCrash, maybe try debian or ubuntu for a while and see if you like it.
[08:54] <Paavo> storkme: so you want to convert that drive to a format where it has a valid partition table?
[08:54] <nothlit> Subhuman, its just you were attributing dependency hell to fedora, when there are better package management systems now
[08:54] <ArrenLex> Rprp: grep "hello" *
[08:54] <SARA> thank you!
[08:55] <Paavo> storkme: what are you planning to do with the drive?
[08:55] <strabes> ArrenLex: you're using radeon not ati for the driver..?
[08:55] <Rprp> doesnt work
[08:55] <Rprp> or it takes ages
[08:55] <nothlit> ServerCrash, theres nothing wrong with sticking with that you know
[08:55] <Slart> is anyone else here using the latest nvidia driver on Ubuntu 6.10? if so, can you use the preferences, scree resolution application or does it report the wrong refresh rates in the drop down box?
[08:55] <ArrenLex> strabes: that's right, because the ati driver doesn't support 3D acceleration at all, for any card. The radeon driver does.
[08:55] <Subhuman> nothlit, im not saying its hell - im jus saying apt is better.
[08:55] <strabes> ArrenLex: ok
[08:55] <Subhuman> Slart, the beta? - if so i am.
[08:55] <Paavo> storkme: and I gather you have data there that you want to keep? if so, you'll have to copy it elsewhere before the change.
[08:55] <nothlit> ServerCrash, sometimes distros work better for some systems than others, but if you use ubuntu then you get its advantages and vision
[08:55] <storkme> Paavo, ok, thanksa
[08:55] <ServerCrash> yes as i wondered, becasue gnome/kde remains same for any distro so what diff it makes me if i am with Ubugtu  or with fedora
[08:56] <Slart> Subhuman: the driver from the nvidia site? nto sure if it's beta or not
[08:56] <Subhuman> Slart, and no it doesnt - did you run "sudo nvidia-xconfig"
[08:56] <nothlit> 'Subhuman in ubuntu - since it uses apt - its VERY easy to install a big package like OO - in fedora or anything RPM based - its more difficult as you have to find the other programs OO needs yourself'
[08:56] <syock> how do i modify acpi settings so that my mouse won`t make the PC resume from standby mode?
[08:56] <Slart> Subhuman: I'll try that.. hold on
[08:56] <nothlit> ServerCrash, if you want kde you run kubuntu
[08:56] <ServerCrash> nothlit, "advantages and vision" can you throw some light
[08:56] <strabes> ArrenLex: do you know if the open source driver supports X1400?
[08:56] <Paavo> storkme: after you've backed up the data simply use fdisk to create the partition table and a partition, and then create a filesystem on the partition
[08:57] <ServerCrash> nothlit, ubuntu doest have kde during installation
[08:57] <lumpki> you can add kde to ubuntu
[08:57] <Jassossovinik> I can gain access to a remote server via ssh. I want to backup a directory on that machine onto this machine, but I can't work out how to do it.  How should I go about this?
[08:57] <nothlit> ServerCrash, using gnome in ubuntu will definitely be more advantageous compared to kde because its the original and most common installation
[08:57] <nothlit> ServerCrash, theres kubuntu
[08:57] <wasabi> Jassossovinik: scp
[08:57] <nothlit> ServerCrash, kubuntu.org
[08:57] <tonyyarusso> Jassossovinik: scp
[08:57] <nothlit> ServerCrash, also xubuntu
[08:57] <Rprp> if i do this: grep "`dood`='1'" * i takes many other words... :/
[08:57] <wasabi> Jassossovinik: scp -r user@remotebox:/path/to/dir /path/to/local/dir
[08:57] <ServerCrash> :o
[08:57] <g0tw00d> Subhuman: am I looking for something in this output from dmesg?  I see my mouse as an input device.
[08:57] <strabes> ArrenLex: do you know if the open source driver supports X1400?
[08:57] <Rprp> it takes lines where that word isnt in it
[08:58] <whiskey4me> Someone please help me with the upgrade from breeze to dapper, pm me plz
[08:58] <Subhuman> g0tw00d, i dont know - i was telling you what dmesg is :D

[08:58] <Jassossovinik> wasabi, of course! Sorry, I can't believe i didn't think of that - i was so hung up with rsync/ssh that I didn't think of scp!
[08:58] <nothlit> ServerCrash, theres a lot of gnome innovation ubuntu uses like gnome-app-install its a program that works like add/remove in windows, but you can actually add things and its very user friendly
[08:58] <Slart> Subhuman: hmm.. tried that.. and it still wants me to choose from 50 Hz or 54 Hz.. very strange
[08:58] <wasabi> Jassossovinik: You can use rsync too
[08:58] <g0tw00d> Subhuman:ok thx
[08:58] <wasabi> rsync -arv user@remotebox:/path/to/remote/file localdir
[08:58] <nothlit> ServerCrash, and you get a huge library of packages
[08:58] <Subhuman> Slart, did you restart?
[08:58] <Subhuman> you need to restart.
[08:59] <nothlit> ServerCrash, but things like codecs especially things like windows codecs and things like skype will take more work
[08:59] <Slart> Subhuman: I did a ctrl-alt-backspace
[08:59] <ServerCrash> nothlit, thanks...time for gdm restart ... testing xgl :D brb
[08:59] <Subhuman> Slart, you did?
[09:00] <Subhuman> Slart, do you know your monitors vert and horiz refresh rates?
=== driv[bbl]  is now known as drivera90
[09:00] <Slart> Subhuman: yes.. I did a ctrl-alt-backspace.. that restarts the x-server, right?
[09:00] <Slart> Subhuman: yes, I know those... I tried entering those in the xorg.conf file but that didn't help either
[09:00] <goki> hi, does anyone know why I can't find either realplay or realplayer packages, after adding plf and other repositories?
[09:00] <Subhuman> if so - do a "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and when you get to the screen setup - select advanced? i think  and it will allow you to manually put them in and get the correct rates
[09:00] <goki> this is on edgy eft
[09:00] <Subhuman> Slart, yes it does.
[09:00] <kandinski> is it just me or the Edgy kernels don't use swap memory at all?
[09:01] <whiskey4me> anyone please how do i upgradeto dapper without runninginto black screen
[09:01] <kitche> Slart: well ctrl-alt-backspace kills X but sicne ubuntu uses gdm it gets restarted
[09:01] <Subhuman> kandinski, no for some reason if you upgrade it doesnt get switched on
[09:01] <kandinski> either that or the system monitor has a bug: it reports zero swap use
[09:01] <kandinski> oh
[09:01] <Subhuman> kandinski, run "sudo swapon /dev/hdwhatever"
[09:01] <Subhuman> and then see.
[09:01] <kandinski> Subhuman: I installed from scratch
[09:01] <kandinski> subhuman: thanks
[09:01] <Subhuman> kandinski, well try swapon then look at system monitor.
[09:01] <whiskey4me> howto upgrade to dapper safely??
[09:01] <kandinski> Subhuman: trying now
[09:02] <Subhuman> whiskey4me,  !upgrade
[09:02] <Subhuman> !upgrade
[09:02] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[09:02] <g0tw00d> is it possible to SSH Ubuntu?
[09:02] <goki> edgy seems less evil than dapper, so far
[09:02] <nothlit> goki, did you do sudo aptitude update?
[09:02] <Subhuman> g0tw00d, yes
[09:02] <strabes> whiskey4me: sudo update-manager -c
[09:02] <Subhuman> just do "sudo apt-get install openssh-server"
[09:02] <kandinski> swapon: /dev/hda2: Device or resource busy
[09:02] <whiskey4me> subhuman i did that 3 times using the stock software upgrade but i got black screen
[09:02] <goki> nothlit, well I updated in synaptic
[09:02] <Subhuman> or find the "openssh-server" package in synaptic.
[09:02] <whiskey4me> what are the exactct codes i need to enter in the terminal
[09:02] <Subhuman> whiskey4me, using what upgrade method?
[09:02] <Spee_Der> I've taken this as far as I am able. Can someone please tell me how to change thedefault backgrond color in the Opera browser from the defaul white to something other ?
[09:02] <Subhuman> and where?
[09:02] <Subhuman> after upgrade
[09:02] <Subhuman> during?
[09:03] <whiskey4me> the one that doesnt result in balck screen
[09:03] <kandinski> also X does not come back up from suspend or hibernate
[09:03] <Subhuman> Spee_Der, wrong channel - ask in an opera IRC channel.
[09:03] <nothlit> Spee_Der, just use somebody else's css file or modify one to suit your wishes
[09:03] <Subhuman> #opera ?? maybe
[09:03] <involved> hello. I want an account in a Shell Provider with IRC access. what would ou recommend as a good one? (not free)
[09:03] <Spee_Der> Thanks Sub
[09:03] <tabasko> is gnome-look.org down? :(
[09:03] <kandinski> I am assuming the rest does; I don't have another computer to test it with via ssh
[09:03] <whiskey4me> subhuman do u mind if i message u
[09:03] <Subhuman> involved, www.silenceisdefeat.org is great
[09:03] <Subhuman> costs $1
[09:03] <Subhuman> whiskey4me, im not regged.
[09:03] <Spee_Der> TY noth
[09:03] <whiskey4me> oki
[09:04] <nothlit> Spee_Der, Preferences/Web Pages might work
[09:04] <Spee_Der> I will look elsewhere...
[09:04] <firefly2442> tabasko: didn't work for me :(
[09:04] <whiskey4me> im gonna try upgrading but i just know imgonna lose ubuntu again
[09:04] <Subhuman> whiskey4me, use the update-manager way
[09:04] <whiskey4me> subhumanhow exactly?
[09:04] <Spee_Der> I've been working on this most of today and still am not appy, but I won't give up, thanks. . . .
[09:04] <Subhuman> kandinski, did it work?
[09:05] <nothlit> The default and recommended way to update ubuntu is from a GUI app?
[09:05] <Spee_Der> nothlit: Well....
[09:05] <goki> yup, I definitely have PLF repository ok
[09:06] <nothlit> Why isn't there a cli way that isn't recommended against?
[09:06] <Subhuman> nothlit, yes.
[09:06] <Subhuman> nothlit, you can with apt-get and dist-upgrade
[09:06] <nothlit> from the wiki Upgrading using apt-get -- NOT RECOMMENDED
[09:06] <Subhuman> just the gui version handles all the repo updates for you
[09:06] <Subhuman> so you cant mess it up
[09:06] <Subhuman> you can mess up the apt one
[09:06] <nothlit> oh
[09:06] <nothlit> I see
[09:06] <Subhuman> and get a horrible dapper/edgy hybrid
[09:06] <goki> ah, PLF doesn't have realplay
[09:06] <Spee_Der> nothlit: When I do it there, fine. As the new page starts it goes to the color of choice, but then defaults to the bright white background....... Ugggh.......   But I'd also like a different shade here in the IRC as well.....    I will do more research, thanks.....
[09:07] <anorexicpillow> is gnome look.org down right now?
[09:07] <lumpki> anorexicpillow, it was earlier
[09:07] <anorexicpillow> hmm still isnt working for me :(
[09:08] <nothlit> I just really wouldn't want to do anything major that will automatically get interrupted if the x server goes down/depends on so many things  to keep working
[09:08] <con-man> anyone know of a good movie player?
[09:08] <anorexicpillow> vlc
[09:08] <con-man> with divx and xvid capabilities
[09:08] <Slart> Subhuman: ok, back.. when I check the OSD on the monitor it's running at 75 Hz but the screen resolution thingy still thinks it's running at 50 Hz...very odd
[09:08] <rbil> mplayer
[09:08] <firefly2442> con-man: xine, mplayer ?
[09:08] <Spee_Der> vlc is good
[09:09] <Jassossovinik> con-man, VLC can play most things, but many prefer mplayer for it's ease of use
[09:09] <con-man> where do i get the codecs for those

[09:09] <czr> dpkg-question: is the a way to get a script executed just before dpkg decides to remove some package (either when directly invoked or via apt-get)
[09:10] <anorexicpillow> hmm yah gnome look still doesnt seem to be working for me
[09:10] <firefly2442> con-man: http://ubuntuguide.org/  this page has info on installing codecs

[09:25] <jrib> SARA: this is about flash crashing firefox, I haven't really followed everything you said: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911   there are 2 workarounds in the comments
[09:25] <itch^> After compileing my 2.6.19 kernel, at boot, the system hangs. It says "Uncompressing linux .. " , and it hangs. Any sugestions ?
[09:25] <Halcy0n> Alright...I have to be doing something stupid.  Why is apt-get hanging here?  "0% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (146.137.96.7)] "
[09:25] <jrib> firefly2442: it doesn't usually happen.  I have no idea why

[09:25] <jrib> utab: have you installed openshh-server?
[09:25] <SARA> yes it is ....everytime i got to a page where they use flash it crashes
[09:25] <firefly2442> Halcy0n: firewall issue?  you are connected to the Internet I assume?
[09:25] <Arawn> At default, SSHD is not installed on Ubuntu

[09:26] <kandinski> any clue?
[09:26] <con-man> still no go
[09:26] <Subhuman> kandinski, run it as sudo

[09:26] <Subhuman> where hda1 is w/e you swap partition is
[09:26] <diminthedam> rbil: funny thing. my usb memory card reads as 'scsi'. any ideas?
[09:26] <Halcy0n> firefly2442: it went through.  It just took a very long time for it to decide it wanted to :)
[09:26] <utab> one more question when I want to connect to Debian box, I always have to use ip, the hostnma does not work
[09:27] <kitche> con-man: you have to log out and back in then you will be in video
[09:27] <kandinski> Subhuman: I did swapon -av
[09:27] <bm1> I just bought a SlimStar 310 keyboard and some of the keycodes are missing (setkeycodes needed and some new mapping). Basically I want to create a new Layout for my GNOME Keyboard manager and do the appropriate setkeycodes in the appropriate way. I've never done something like this, so can somebody help me to fix this?
[09:27] <kandinski> where -a turns on swap according to my correctly specified /etc/fstab
[09:27] <brfrodo> jevangelo hi :p
[09:27] <kandinski> and it gives me a "Device or resource busy"
[09:27] <jevangelo> hi

[09:28] <SARA> jrib any more help?
[09:28] <brfrodo> Oo
[09:28] <rbil> diminthedam: it mounts as a sdx device? I think that is normal.
[09:28] <utab> jrib, is that automatically installed when you install ssh
[09:28] <christian1222> anyone have any idea why regular ubuntu sounds wont work, but mp3's do?
[09:28] <beakmann> hey! Somebody setup a irda connection with a mobile phone?
[09:28] <utab> jrib, I mean ssh-server
[09:28] <jrib> utab: not sure
[09:28] <jevangelo> no
[09:29] <kitche> utab: ssh is the client ubuntu split the ssh-server and the client up
[09:29] <Arawn> utab, at default, Ubuntu don't have ssh-server
[09:29] <utab> Arawn, ok what should I do
[09:29] <jrib> SARA: did you read through the comments?  (I'm a little busy atm but give me a few minutes and I can help you with more detail)

[09:30] <kitche> utab: con-man: open up a console and type groups it should tell you what groups your in
[09:30] <SARA> how do i do that....
[09:30] <diminthedam> rbil: sorry, i am confused a bit. which of these http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35216/ is my usb flash card? (its the only thing plugged in at moment)

[09:31] <con-man> so ive set up the video group
[09:31] <con-man> but i still cant play videos
[09:31] <PWill> SARA: ok, first run this command: rm .mozilla/plugins/*
[09:32] <J4kch> Silly question: How do I open ports?
[09:32] <kitche> utab: ok whatever you say sicne what I said had nothing to do with you
[09:32] <utab> Arawn, when I try to connect to debian I have to supply the ip, the hostname fails
[09:32] <con-man> I can but it cant initialize video
[09:32] <con-man> i can play NON divx videos
[09:32] <kitche> con-man: then your probably missing the divx codec
[09:32] <SARA> well i already removed firefox
[09:32] <Arawn> utab, see your /etc/resolv.conf
[09:32] <jrib> J4kch: they are open unless you closed them
[09:32] <sindrum> any ideas as to why mplayer isnt giving me  video only sound?
[09:32] <jrib> sindrum: have you installed w32codecs?
[09:33] <blakkinferno> jrib: Ubuntu automatically opens ports? Noice
[09:33] <sindrum> ok give try ty
[09:33] <con-man> where do  I Get codecs?
[09:33] <xzk> help - my clock keeps crashing, and popping up a bug buddy crashing thing

[09:33] <blakkinferno> I am new to ubuntu, so im just in here to soak up some knowledge
[09:33] <blakkinferno> haha
[09:33] <kitche> !codecs
[09:33] <JoshJ> not a bad idea

[09:34] <blakkinferno> thanks
[09:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about resolves.cof - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:34] <J4kch> jrib: not really no

[09:34] <firefly2442> con-man: try here: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Multimedia_Codecs
[09:34] <jrib> !firestarter
[09:34] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[09:34] <utab> Arawn, I can see my dns servers and domain there, but what is to do with the hostname resolution
[09:34] <blakkinferno> Ooh, firewalls.
[09:34] <blakkinferno> I see.
[09:35] <blakkinferno> Does anyone here know of any good intel drivers?
[09:35] <J4kch> jrib: installing now
[09:35] <mister_roboto> Arawn: man resolv.conf
[09:35] <kandinski> oh, fixed it!
[09:35] <utab> Arawn, from both sides I can ssh to the other side by supplying ips not the hostnames
[09:35] <ck3> what do we do if http://us.archive.ubuntu.com is borked?
[09:35] <kandinski> !swapon
[09:35] <SARA> Pwill i reinstalled firefox now what?
[09:35] <nothlit> !fireflier
[09:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about swapon - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:35] <jrib> J4kch: ok, that will let give you a gui, but it should be open afaik
[09:35] <dmglouis> does anyone know how to get ubuntu to recognize a sansa e250r?
[09:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fireflier - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:35] <ck3> as in, who should I tell?
[09:35] <diminthedam> can anyone tell me which is my USB memory stick from this udev print out http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35216/ please
[09:35] <J4kch> ck3: use uk.archive.ubuntu.com for example
[09:35] <PWill> SARA: now try reinstalling the flashplayer 9 beta
[09:35] <J4kch> ck3: oh, noone
[09:35] <Halcy0n> ck3: it was slow for me for a minute, but its working fine now.
[09:35] <jrib> SARA: if you want to try the workarounds in the bug just say my name in #ubuntu-classroom.  it's less crowded there
[09:35] <SARA> PWILL how again?
[09:36] <blakkinferno> What are the best drivers to get for Ubuntu for Intels and Radeons?
[09:36] <Arawn> utab, in your resolves.conf, you will write : DEBIAN  [tab]  IP
[09:36] <kandinski> Subhuman, I fixed my bug thanks to a Spanish-language mailing list. How do I tell ubotu about the fix?
[09:36] <PWill> SARA: go to http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[09:36] <firefly2442> blakkinferno: graphics cards you mean?
[09:36] <SARA> cant i just do it in my terminal
[09:36] <kitche> blakkinferno: umm xserver-video-ati xserver-video-intel
[09:36] <blakkinferno> firefly: YUSH.
[09:36] <kandinski> Subhuman: I want to make ubotu give the fix as answer to "!swapon"
[09:36] <beakmann> hey! Somebody setup a irda connection with a mobile phone?
[09:36] <blakkinferno> kitche: What?
[09:36] <ck3> Halcy0n: seems to be having troubles - the 3 times I have loked at it in the last hour say "current bandwidth utilization  0.00 Mbit/s" which makes me think it isn't serving much
[09:37] <J4kch> jrib: it COULD be because of my router, it has a built-in firewall I hear
[09:37] <LacunaV> Is there a way to install ubuntu without installing grub?
[09:37] <jrib> J4kch: yes, that is probably it
[09:37] <dmglouis> can anyone help me?
[09:37] <kitche> diminthedam: do you have sata drives or no?
[09:37] <blakkinferno> kitche: What do i do with those?
[09:37] <mark__> how do I get TV-out working in Dapper?
[09:37] <PWill> SARA: then click on "download installer for linux"
[09:37] <firefly2442> LacunaV: why do you want to do that?
[09:37] <LacunaV> I dont' want it messing with my grub setup, just put the kernel files in /boot
[09:37] <rbil> diminthedam: http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html
[09:37] <kandinski> !ubotu
[09:37] <[Gino] > Okay, so... I installed Ubuntu (GNOME) and then I did "aptitude install kubuntu-desktop" Now, can I remove GNOME completley, and just keep KDE?
[09:37] <kitche> blakkinferno: those two packages are for the radeon open source driver and the open source intel driver
[09:37] <SARA> ok i did that
[09:38] <diminthedam> kitche: i dont know what sata drives are. i have a tx31 laptop..with usb stick hanging in it!
[09:38] <blakkinferno> kitche: So do i type something in as a command to download them?
[09:38] <firefly2442> LacunaV: it should just update and keep everything else the same no?
[09:38] <PWill> SARA: sorry, my connection blorped for a second. anyways, next you need to open the .tar.gz file in archive manager
[09:38] <kitche> diminthedam:  then it's probablt /dev/sda1 if your not sure
[09:38] <sindrum> jrib thanks for the tip the codecs worked
[09:38] <blakkinferno> kitche: like sudo aptitude <> ?
[09:38] <blakkinferno> kitche; I dont understand linux commands very well yet.
[09:38] <LacunaV> firefly2442: I don't know. Gentoo didn't
[09:38] <nothlit> Anyone know security/stability of apache vs lighthttpd?
[09:38] <ck3> what package do I install to get the 686 kernel, and keep it up to date?
[09:38] <blakkinferno> kitche: First linux system i've ever tried.
[09:38] <kitche> blakkinferno:  sudo aptitude install xserver-video-(radeon, intel)
[09:39] <utab> Arawn, still no replies
[09:39] <firefly2442> LacunaV: dunno, I haven't tried installing multiple Linux OS's sorry...
[09:39] <blakkinferno> kitche: Thanks ! Will it give 3D ability, or no?
[09:39] <nothlit> ck3, in edgy you can just use the generic kernel thats already installed
[09:39] <SARA> extract ot?
[09:39] <SARA> it?
[09:39] <PWill> SARA: click on the file called "libflashplayer.so" and hit "extract" and make it save to your home folder
[09:39] <blakkinferno> kitche: And also, i thought i read somewhere about a Radeon driver like fgrlx
[09:39] <nothlit> LacunaV, you need to use the alternate install disc
[09:39] <blakkinferno> kitche; Or something similiar
[09:39] <xzk> help i my clock wont let me change the time - it keeps crashing
[09:39] <blakkinferno> kitche: flgrx, flrgx, something
[09:39] <xzk> emergency emergency
[09:39] <kitche> blakkinferno: the intel driver will but the open source radeon won't for that you need the xserver-video-fglrx
[09:39] <diminthedam> kitche: the messages tail tells me its sdb, for some reason http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35218/
[09:39] <blakkinferno> kitche: THANKS!
[09:39] <PWill> SARA: then from the terminal, run `mv libflashplayer.so .mozilla/plugins/
[09:39] <LacunaV> nothlit: Ok, does it say "install ubuntu without grub" or something?
[09:40] <blakkinferno> kitche; I am glad ubuntu has people that are willing to help
[09:40] <blakkinferno> kitche: Thanks a lot
[09:40] <Arawn> utab, see http://www.computing.net/unix/wwwboard/forum/5986.html
[09:40] <kitche> diminthedam: then you probably have sata drives
[09:40] <blakkinferno> kitche: on a side note... I AM LOVING UBUNTU.
[09:40] <kandinski> !factoid
[09:40] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[09:40] <nothlit> [Gino] , yes you can, but you'll have to do it per package, you can just use Kubuntu instead next time
[09:40] <diminthedam> kitches: then what?
[09:40] <kitche> diminthedam: see if it's mounted in /media
[09:40] <brfrodo> magoo o/
[09:40] <nothlit> LacunaV, there should be some grub setup config options somewhere along the way, like a regular installer, nothing as obnoxious as the desktop cd not asking you
[09:40] <brfrodo> pvt
=== magoo is now known as magoooo
[09:41] <PWill> blakkinferno: hooray! try going to http://www.ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=103 and posting your testimonial
[09:41] <LacunaV> nothlit: Thank god, sounds good. Thanks :)
[09:41] <LacunaV> And thank you firefly2442
[09:41] <diminthedam> kitche: yup it mounts in media, but all my USB devices mount randomly. i was reading udev setting rules, but cant figure out which of that listing refers to my usb stick
[09:41] <rbil> diminthedam:  read this explanation ... you can use more than one way to define the device in a rule :  http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html
[09:41] <hayig2000> could i install on one partition or should i have the whole harddrive empty?
[09:41] <blakkinferno> Pwill: haha, i might. Windows is overrated.
[09:42] <diminthedam> rbil: will do. thanks again
[09:42] <PWill> blakkinferno: heh. yes, this is true.
[09:42] <kitche> diminthedam: well you have to mae a udev rule for it it's in /etc/udev/rules.d and I don't think that's what you want sicne udev rules just make it so the device will stick to a certain name
[09:42] <[Gino] > nothlit: So, would I apt-get remove like on http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde ?
[09:42] <dmglouis> does anyone know how to make ubuntu recognize a sansa e250r?
[09:42] <dougb> hey everyone.  i just updated ubuntu and it updated the kernel from .23 to .27, now my ndiswrapper won't install.  do i need to recompile the ndiswrapper to work with the newly updated kernel?
[09:42] <SARA> when i type it in my terminal it does not do anything
[09:43] <nothlit> [Gino] , yeah whichever correct article is the right one on psychocats
[09:43] <jrib> dmglouis: I believe that player has two modes.  You need to set it to the mode that lets it act as a storage device, then just plug it in
[09:43] <nothlit> UMS is the name
[09:43] <nothlit> Unversal Mass Storage
[09:43] <PWill> SARA: run this: ls .mozilla/plugins.
[09:43] <diminthedam> kitche: no, thats what i want.. so my usb devices mount under their name only!
[09:43] <dmglouis> jrib: i have the rhapsody one, and it has only rhapsody and playsforsure modes
[09:43] <kandinski> !swapon is The Edgy swap bug can be fixed by 1: $ sudo fdisk -l; 2: note which hard disk is your swap partition; 3: edit (as root) your /etc/fstab file and substitute your swap partition name for its uuid; 4: $ sudo swapon -a; (or restart)
[09:43] <PWill> SARA: run this: ls .mozilla/plugins/
[09:43] <kandinski> !swapon
[09:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about swapon - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:43] <kandinski> damn, ubotu
[09:43] <kandinski> I just told you
[09:44] <nothlit> dmglouis, playforsure is a rhapsody mode and sandisk players have a UMS option.
[09:44] <blakkinferno> kitche: Eeep i have a question!
[09:44] <dmglouis> jrib: im not sure if the playsforsure is MTP
[09:44] <kitche> diminthedam: well for usb it's harder to do
[09:44] <jrib> kandinski: it has to be approved
[09:44] <FirstStrike> Seveas: EVIL
[09:44] <kandinski> please, someone who can approve this tell ubotu
[09:44] <nothlit> dmglouis, well actually playforsure is what rhapsody uses
[09:44] <blakkinferno> kitche: I typed in sudo aptitude install xserver-video-intel and it said couldnt find any packages with matching name or description
[09:44] <jrib> dmglouis: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=286629&highlight=sansa
[09:44] <hayig2000> is there a manual to read before installation?
[09:44] <JoshJ> put it on the wiki page, Kanafani
[09:44] <Seveas> FirstStrike, yes
[09:44] <blakkinferno> kitche: Sorry if its a dumb question.
[09:44] <JoshJ> i think you have to do it that wa
[09:44] <JoshJ> *way
[09:44] <kandinski> ah, ok: ubotu just told me the ops have been informed
[09:44] <kitche> blakkinferno: try xserver-xorg-video-intel
[09:44] <SARA> still nothing
[09:44] <JoshJ> ah, nifty
[09:44] <nothlit> dmglouis, its a windows media protocol, its for DRM files
[09:45] <christian1222> does anyone know what i should do with a .chm file?
[09:45] <utab> Arawn, that did not help
[09:45] <blakkinferno> kitche: Okay, thanks. And a quick question... ive read a bit through the forums, and heard of alot of "xorg" stuff. What is it?!
[09:45] <diminthedam> kitche: i would usually worry, but now i cant even find my USB mounted folder anymore. Says 'iriver' on desktop, but its not in /media or anywhere else to be found!
[09:45] <dmglouis> well i have the 250r
[09:45] <jrib> christian1222: install xchm and view it
[09:45] <nothlit> dmglouis, if you've added drm files from rhapsody you won't be able to access them with a linux system
[09:45] <kandinski> oh, badly formed too
[09:45] <diminthedam> kitche: i woudnt...
[09:45] <JoshJ> !Xorg
[09:45] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[09:45] <dmglouis> the only modes available are rhapsody and playsforsure
[09:45] <kandinski> !swapon is <reply>The Edgy swap bug can be fixed by 1: $ sudo fdisk -l; 2: note which hard disk is your swap partition; 3: edit (as root) your /etc/fstab file and substitute your swap partition name for its uuid; 4: $ sudo swapon -a; (or restart)
[09:45] <kandinski> better
[09:45] <kitche> blakkinferno: it's a server that does graphcis Desktop and such
[09:45] <blakkinferno> kitche: Yay, its working!
[09:45] <JoshJ> X.org is essentially your windowing system
[09:45] <blakkinferno> kitche: Oh, okay, thanks.
[09:46] <PWill> SARA: open your home folder, and click on view, and select "show hidden files"
[09:46] <nothlit> dmglouis, like i said before rhapsody uses playforsure.
[09:46] <kitche> diminthedam: wellif it's an iriver you might need to search for a udev rule for it sicne I only know about the ipod
[09:46] <blakkinferno> kitche: Now, it stopped doing stuff. Did it automatically install intel drivers? Can i use the gfx card fully now?
[09:46] <dmglouis> nothlit: then why do i have two different modes
[09:46] <nothlit> !ums

[09:46] <JoshJ> ls -a shows hidden folders, just fyi
[09:46] <diminthedam> kitche: its the usb memory card i'm worried about
[09:46] <hayig2000> could i install on one partition or should i have the whole harddrive empty?

[09:48] <dougb> has anyone else had a problem with the NDISWRAPPER breaking after an automatic update?
[09:48] <blakkinferno> kitche: Do i have to do anything to make the drivers work, or are they automatically being used?
[09:48] <PWill> SARA: ok, go into it, and open a folder called plugins
[09:48] <kitche> blakkinferno: you have to reconfigure xorg to use the i810 driver
[09:48] <dmglouis> nothlit: thanks for clearing it up, i changed it to rhapsody mode and it works now
[09:48] <klaagvaak> No
[09:48] <SARA> ok there is nothing there
[09:48] <PWill> ok
[09:48] <blakkinferno> kitche: wow... how do you do that? (Sorry for all the questions)
[09:48] <BrokenPipe> Is there a DVD ripper that isn't HandBrake? Or someone here that has had success with HandBrake that is willing to help me out?
[09:48] <kitche> blakkinferno: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and pick the i810 driver in a console then ctrl-alt-backspace
[09:49] <PWill> SARA: keep that window open. now open the flash .tar.gz file again

[09:58] <Huibert> xzk: the clock applet in the panel?
[09:58] <Dybber> Does anyone know which package that contains Esetroot?
[09:58] <xzk> huibert: yes, top right
[09:58] <x0x> nothlit: what do u mean?i'm new(just installed it yesterday)..hehe
[09:58] <blakkinferno> kitche: Yes, thats what i typed in. It worked the first time, but i clicked enter instead of ctrl+whatever on accident, so i don't think it worked right.
[09:58] <blakkinferno> kitche: it asked me to name it
[09:58] <blakkinferno> kitche: and i named it, but it brought me to a screen i coundnt get past
[09:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: So i exited and decided to try again.
[09:59] <PWill> SARA: that is just too strang, i'm lost for ideas. try posting your problem to ubuntuforums.org
[09:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: But, it wont let me.
[09:59] <jrib> SARA: what is the output of this command:  xdpyinfo| grep -i 'depth of root'
[09:59] <PWill> strange*
[09:59] <Huibert> xzk: it crashes directly after you try to add it, or only after you alter the date/time settings?
[09:59] <kitche> blakkinferno ok open up a console and do killall dpkg-reconfigure
[09:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: then try again?
[09:59] <nothlit> x0x, both the copying and the pasting window should both be root permission windows
[09:59] <SARA> i dont know
[09:59] <jrib> SARA: of course, just enter it in a terminal and press enter
[09:59] <blakkinferno> kitche: says...dpkg-reconfigure(5897): Operation not permitted
[10:00] <blakkinferno> dpkg-reconfigure: no process killed
[10:00] <xzk> huibert: after i try to adjust date & time - it was added default when i installed ubuntu, but the time was never right - i guess it conflicted with winxp
[10:00] <kitche> blakkinferno: yes make sure you do sudo killall dpkg-reconfigure
[10:00] <blakkinferno> kitche: o, forgot sudo
[10:00] <ndc> i have the problem with vmware server
[10:00] <slicky> hi.. how do i disable so my screen dont get black after 10 mins of inactivity?  iv disabled the screensaver.. and the powersave thing ..
[10:00] <blakkinferno> kitche: thanks
[10:00] <ernz> Will someone running beryl please tell me how to free-rotate the cube?
[10:00] <kitche> ernz: ctrl-alt+<- or ->
[10:00] <ndc> the vmware hung when start up  and take long time when start
[10:00] <PWill> slicky: hit "Alt+F2" and type in gnome-power-preferences
[10:01] <nothlit> ernz press ctrl+alt and start dragging with the mouse
[10:01] <Huibert> xzk: yes, win xp asumes the bios is your local time, linux uses your bios as GMT and uses your  timezone for the corect time
[10:01] <JoshJ> hold control and drag the mouse
[10:01] <Jassossovinik> ernz, hold down ctrl+alt and then click your mouse and move it around
[10:01] <nothlit> hold ctrl+alt actually
[10:01] <SARA>  depth of root window:    24 planes
[10:01] <nothlit> xp doesn't use utc?
[10:01] <JoshJ> either that changed or i changed it heh
[10:01] <ernz> nothlit, Jassossovinik: Cheers.
[10:01] <Huibert> xzk: have you tried using ntp in linux
[10:01] <x0x> nothlit: the folder i want to copy isn't there,in root windows.
[10:01] <ndc> how that
[10:01] <jasp> Dybber, Esetroot is in package eterm
[10:01] <blakkinferno> kitche: I typed the command, then redid your instructions
[10:01] <slicky> PWill, yes.. been there..  everything there is disabled..
[10:02] <blakkinferno> kitche: it restarted ubuntu
[10:02] <blakkinferno> kitche: Is that what its supposed to do?
[10:02] <jrib> SARA: hmm then it may not be the same problem.  Do you get any terminal output when firefox crashes if you run firefox from the terminal?
[10:02] <nothlit> x0x, view> show hidden files/folders or press ctrl+h
[10:02] <kitche> blakkinferno: you did the ctrl+alt+backspace it restarts Xorg which is what you want
[10:02] <Huibert> xzk: have you tried using ntp in linux?
[10:02] <x0x> nothlit: it is in another partitions
[10:02] <Dybber> jasp, thanks :D
[10:02] <blakkinferno> kitche: Okay, but i did it straight on the list.
[10:02] <slicky> PWill, it quite enoying when im watching movies ;P
[10:02] <blakkinferno> kitche: I think i did it wrong.
[10:02] <SARA> im not sure let me try
[10:02] <xzk> huibert: what is ntp - i have had the prob in the past with linux conflicting with my winxp time - but that was on my desktop, and to fix that prob i just told linux to use 'utc' i think.. and that solved the prob that time
[10:02] <nothlit> well you have to mount the partition and then navigate to it
[10:02] <blakkinferno> kitche: How do i check if it worked?
[10:03] <jrib> SARA: make sure you close all firefox first
[10:03] <ernz> nothlit, Jassossovinik, kitche: This is kinda bizarre, Just installed beryl, and I just tried running an AVI, and the colours within the video are all weird and the image is ghosting, whats the problem, here?
[10:03] <racarter> how do I configure firewall settings in ubuntu?
[10:03] <peder_> I got some problem with apt.. Cant use it, cause this happends: http://pastebin.no/585
[10:03] <kitche> blakkinferno: look at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to see if i810 is listed
[10:03] <Huibert> xzk: yes, that should fix the winxp / linux conflict.
[10:03] <xzk> huibret: i'm on my laptop this time
[10:03] <blakkinferno> ok
[10:03] <nothlit> ernz, try googling it, i think i've seen that issue somewhere and the fix online
[10:03] <Huibert> xzk: but it is not good that a timeadjustment crashes the clock applet

[10:03] <xzk> huibret: after i did that 'utc' thing to my laptop is when it stopped letting me adjust the clock and crashing in linux
[10:04] <SARA> ok so what do i do now?
[10:04] <kitche> ernz: yeah there is a fix on the net for it it's a bug with beryl/compiz
[10:04] <nothlit> Huibert, you can change the time from the clock applet lol
[10:04] <Huibert> xzk: it could be that adjusting the time in the applet causes problems.
[10:04] <xzk> huibret: does it ever happen that the 'utc' shouldn't need to be checked in order for linux and winxp to have the same time?
[10:04] <Huibert> xzk: or causes the crash
[10:04] <blakkinferno> kitche: I CTRL+F'ed it
[10:04] <jrib> SARA: did you make firefox crash?
[10:04] <nothlit> xzk, you can change it so linux doesn't use utc
[10:04] <blakkinferno> kitche: and found this
[10:05] <ernz> kitche: Any idea where this "fix" might be? :)
[10:05] <blakkinferno> kitche:
[10:05] <xzk> huibret: i never noticed the time being wrong before i checked the box on my laptop - i just did it preimptively because i remembered my winxp desktop pc having clock probs with linux

[10:05] <Huibert> xzk: that's why you could try to let the ntp daemon adjust the time

[10:11] <Tominator> but if they won't run?
[10:11] <nothlit> xzk, that just means it follows the HIG human interface guidelines as specified by GNOME

[10:14] <Tominator> kitche: i know, bit they are to olt to work with beryl, aren't they? so i tried to install the newer ones, but some of them won't work, some of them are buggy, and some of them won't install...
[10:14] <xzk> Xchat is better than Gnome Xchat?
[10:14] <kitche> Tominator: you need XGL to use the drivers in ubuntu
[10:15] <coreyh> amicraw: if you're on dapper, you edit /etc/sources.list replace "dapper" with "edgy" and then do regular updates
[10:15] <Comrade_S> xzk:  gnome xchat simplifies the xchat gui
[10:15] <kitche> xzk: well xchat-gnome !=xchat
[10:15] <Tominator> kitche: thats too buggy either :)
[10:15] <Ali2004> Hello All
[10:15] <coreyh> amicraw: or follow this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades

[10:15] <justin_> When I select "all upgrades" from Synpatic, will it remove old versions and replace them with the new? -- keeping disk space relatively the same as before I updated things that were marked for updates?
[10:15] <xzk> what do you guys use for IRC in linux?
[10:15] <justin_> xzk: I use Irssi
[10:15] <xzk> lets take a poll
[10:15] <Jassossovinik> xzk, Xchat
[10:15] <coreyh> I'm using gaim
[10:15] <Tominator> kitche: thats why i tried to install the newer nvidia-drivers

[10:16] <DigitalNinja> I'm trying to build  a gnucash 2.0.2 package from the source tar file. It seems that the package build process is looking for "/usr/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults". This directory is located in /etc. How do I tell dpgk-buildpackage to look in /etc?
[10:16] <kitche> Tominator: well you can download the linux-source from the repo and get the nvidia driver that way
[10:16] <tigsa> Ali2004, no loitering
[10:16] <justin_> When I select "all upgrades" from Synpatic, will it remove old versions and replace them with the new? -- keeping disk space relatively the same as before I updated things that were marked for updates?

[10:16] <Tominator> thanks...
[10:16] <Ali2004> tigsa:Thanks
[10:16] <justin_> xzk: Well it's a console application :) but you can run it from an X terminal yes
[10:17] <jrib> SARA: /join #ubuntu-classroom
[10:17] <justin_> well only one way to find out I guess.. updates time..
[10:17] <xzk> justin_: lol XChat already looks like a terminal window.. i have it set to use the terminal font
[10:17] <DigitalNinja> I'm trying to build a package for gnucash 2.0.2. When I run dpkg-buildpackage I get an error. It's looking for "/usr/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults". This is in /etc. How do I tell dpkg-buildpackage to look in /etc?
[10:17] <Tominator> kitche: does the newest one install then?
[10:17] <thiagop> Hi guys! :) How i update fstab automatically?
[10:18] <kitche> Tominator: it should
[10:18] <lucas9000> can anyone help me with mounting a hd real quick?
[10:18] <stekotzurivychps> jhow long does it take to get response from broadcast ping ??
[10:18] <Tominator> great, thanks ;)
[10:18] <xzk> hmm... xchat gnome or xchat
[10:18] <Huibert> lucas9000: what are you trying to do?
[10:18] <xzk1> hmm
[10:18] <nothlit> xzk, you think it does lol?
[10:18] <purem> hello everyone
[10:18] <x-r00t-x> lucas9000,
[10:18] <lucas9000> i formatted an internal drive to ext3 using gparted
[10:19] <lucas9000> then mounted the drive according to these instructions: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/mountlinux
[10:19] <purem> does anyone know how to make certaint programs open by default when you login. Like gaim and checkgmail
[10:19] <xzk1> wow xchat has a LOT smaller font than xchat gnome
[10:19] <lucas9000> now gparted says the drive is mounted, but i can't find it anywhere
[10:19] <xzk1> how can i get it to highlight my msg's and the msg's to me
[10:19] <Comrade_S> purem:  system > preferences > sessions
[10:19] <lucas9000> i don't see it in the /storage folder created according to that page's instructions
[10:19] <Huibert> lucas9000: open a terminal and type mount, is it in the list?
[10:20] <tigsa> lucas9000, if you type 'mount' it should tell you the location of all mounted volumes
[10:20] <lucas9000> ok brb
[10:20] <tigsa> Huibert, ><
[10:20] <purem> thank you Comrade
[10:20] <lucas9000> /dev/sdc1 on /storage type ext3 (rw)
[10:20] <lucas9000> that's the one
[10:20] <Huibert> tigsa: what do ypu mean >.<
[10:20] <tigsa> lucas9000, there it is, /storage
[10:20] <xzk1> I have to say.. linux's IRC clients kick the ass of windows clients
[10:20] <tigsa> Huibert, nothing.. i forgive you! :D
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
=== xzk1 is now known as xzk
[10:21] <lucas9000> but when i use the folder browser to browse it, it doesn't show up in /storage...?
[10:21] <[swb] > whats the best linux irc client?
[10:21] <Huibert> lucas9000: type "df -h" you should see it in the free space listing
[10:21] <Jassossovinik> <xzk1> wow xchat has a LOT smaller font than xchat gnome <== xchat >> xchat-gnome :-)
[10:21] <Tominator> kitche: i need legacy drivers... I've got a Ti4400 but where du i get new ones?
[10:21] <xzk> swb: i think its Xchat all the way
[10:21] <Huibert> lucas9000: you just formatted it, its empty
[10:21] <Ali2004> Is it true that Canonical will stop supporting PowerPC from Feisty Fawn?
[10:21] <kitche> Tominator: from nvidia website they have legacy drivers as well
[10:21] <lucas9000> huibert: it did show up there as well
[10:21] <Tominator> kitche: thanks ;)
[10:22] <lucas9000> but how do i now put anything on it if it?
[10:22] <DBO> Ali2004, I dont know aobut feisty, but support will eventually drop as PPC isnt made by well... anyone any more
[10:22] <XiXaQ> How can I list the currently logged in users and their processes?
[10:22] <Huibert> lucas9000: well, there you are, it's there, and empty,
[10:22] <Huibert> go grab some mp3's and vids and copy them :-)
[10:22] <lucas9000> ok ty huibert and tigsa
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[10:22] <xzk> raise your hand if you are an Xchat Power User - I got some questions to ask :)
[10:22] <Jassossovinik> XiXaQ, "users" lists logged in users and "ps -ef" lists all processes and their initiating user
[10:22] <lucas9000> i am truly a noob at this :)
[10:23] <Jassossovinik> xzk, #xchat ;-)
[10:23] <lucas9000> later
[10:23] <XiXaQ> Jassossovinik, thanks. :)
[10:23] <Tominator> kitche: i don't find them?
[10:23] <Tominator> ahh there they are ^^
[10:23] <XiXaQ> Jassossovinik, oh, and how can I force another user to log out?

[10:24] <xzk> jassossovinik: thanks!  -- also, lol wow.. that name is not irc friendly

[10:24] <Tominator> kitche: 1.0-7184??? hell damn it! these are older ones, than i installed? arend there 9xxx supporting the ti4400?
[10:24] <gopp> I tryed getting ext2 to mount in windows
[10:24] <gopp> but no luck, after I installed the driver
[10:24] <DBO> Ali2004, I dont think they will be dropping support that fast
[10:24] <gopp> is thier any other way
[10:25] <Ali2004> DBO:Thanks
[10:25] <Huibert> gopp: is that a windows question?
[10:25] <juans> Cual es la ultima version de ubuntu?
[10:25] <gopp> I am trying to mount,  my unbuntu drive in windows
[10:25] <Huibert> !es > juans
[10:25] <gopp> to transfer stuff,
[10:25] <gopp> is that possible

[10:25] <Ali2004> wow.... this room is multilingual

[10:25] <gopp> !ext
[10:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ext - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:26] <Tominator> kitche: sorry, was that rude? im not that into english ;)
[10:26] <Huibert> gopp: I've heard off a windows filesystem plugin to mount ext2/3 and reiserfs, ......
[10:26] <fordboy0> gopp: http://www.fs-driver.org/
[10:26] <DigitalNinja> is anyone building their own packages?
[10:27] <gopp> fordboy0,  I installed that and rebooted still it didin't mount my ubuntu drive
[10:27] <raich> hey i got this problem with .wmv files... some of them play and some others just have sound but no video. i have w32codecs intalled and use totem, any ideas?
[10:27] <gopp> and thier support is none
[10:27] <gopp> or very litte
[10:27] <J4kch> raich: get mplayer
[10:27] <fordboy0> Did you use the Control Panel app?
[10:27] <Ali2004> totem-xine is nice too
[10:27] <gopp> fordboy let me see
[10:27] <J4kch> psh
[10:27] <raich> tote-xine?
[10:27] <dhuv> hello all, I am using kubuntu and I would like to change the setting to have kdesu prompt for the root password rather than the user's password
[10:27] <Ali2004> much better than totem-gstream
[10:27] <fordboy0> gopp: http://www.fs-driver.org/faq.html#conf_drv_ltr
[10:27] <desrt> does anyone know if there is a way to make an interface in /etc/network/interfaces depend on another?
[10:28] <desrt> so that it isn't brought up until the other one is up
[10:28] <raich> ok i'm gonna try with totem-xine
[10:28] <raich> thanks
[10:28] <Huibert> dhuv: kdesu is based on sudo , it will never prompt for a root password
[10:28] <agliv5>  Greetings :) can anyone help me with problems that I am having installing the JRE 5.0 Update 10?
[10:28] <fordboy0> gopp:  as little as I use windows (always _other_ people's PCs), I've had success with it every time.
[10:28] <Ali2004> don't forget to install the plugin for firefox too
[10:28] <Ali2004> LOL
[10:28] <gop> fordboy0 you do
[10:28] <strabes> !ask | agliv5
[10:28] <ubotu> agliv5: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:28] <J4kch> Say, anyone know a good program to listen to podcasts/radio ?
[10:29] <gop> fordboy0 you mean the ifs drives icon
[10:29] <gop> yes I used htat
[10:29] <Huibert> !sudo | dhuv
[10:29] <ubotu> dhuv: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:29] <DigitalNinja> raich: Where are you from?
[10:29] <gop> but it don't show my linux drive
[10:29] <fordboy0> gopp: With EXT3 filesystem on my external USB anyway
[10:29] <raich> DigitalNinja, peru, why?
[10:29] <fordboy0> gopp: Is it EXT2/3?
[10:29] <gop> ext3
[10:29] <gop> what ever defualt with ubuntu
[10:29] <DigitalNinja> raich: Thought you were someone I new.
[10:29] <pecisk> !ati
[10:29] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:29] <fordboy0> That sure is odd.
[10:29] <raich> DigitalNinja, oic
[10:29] <gop> all I see is two ntfs drives
[10:29] <fordboy0> gopp: I think default for Ubuntu is ReiserFS.
[10:30] <gop> oh,
[10:30] <gop> that might be it
[10:30] <Huibert> fordboy0: I think the default is ext3
[10:30] <fordboy0> Huibert:  I don't recall :(
[10:30] <purem> does anyone know how to change an icon to another icon
[10:30] <gop> !ReiserFS
[10:30] <ubotu> reiserfs is a journalling file system, in benchmarks it outperforms many others on I/O operations, but they take notoriously long to mount.
[10:30] <DigitalNinja> raich: Are there a lot of Linux users in peru?
[10:30] <purem> like if I wanted the swiftfox icon to still be firefox
[10:30] <shwag> anyone know how to get a dell laptop to do a resolution of 1360x768
[10:30] <J4kch> How do I get the latest JAVA version (with firefox being able to use it)?
[10:30] <gop> !EXT2
[10:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about EXT2 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:31] <fordboy0> ubotu:  'tis why I use XFS... lol
[10:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tis why I use XFS... lol - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:31] <Huibert> !ext3
[10:31] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[10:31] <Ali2004> DigitalNinja:I believe he/she is gone
[10:31] <Huibert> fordboy0: I'm teh winner :-)
[10:31] <DigitalNinja> Ali2004: Thanks
[10:31] <christian1222> has anyone used mythtv?
[10:31] <gop> fordboy0 yes I installed that but hmm
[10:31] <finalbeta> On my Card it seemed to give about half the quality tvtime gave me.
[10:32] <gop> my 60 gig linux drive
[10:32] <gop> won't show
[10:32] <fordboy0> If you want to exchange data between Windows and Linux, you can always set up a FAT32 partition...
[10:32] <christian1222> i have a tv tuner card, and im wondering how to use it with ubuntu
[10:32] <agliv5> strabes:  I did ask a question... I tried to install following the guide and it's not working, so can anyone help?
[10:32] <fordboy0> Or just stop using Windows :-D
[10:32] <christian1222> finalbeta: you think tvtime would work better?
[10:32] <mc44> !vlc
[10:32] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
=== Deaigo32 is now known as Deaigo
[10:32] <finalbeta> christian1222, yes I do. It's fairly simple.
[10:33] <purem> Songbird should be added to that list
[10:33] <christian1222> finalbeta: ill try it and tell you what i think, thanks
[10:33] <wildfire_> ello.
[10:34] <finalbeta> christian1222, tvtime plays TV. Mythtv has allot of fancy stuff. You have to choose what you need.
[10:34] <roe> does anyone know if flash9 has hit the repos yet?
[10:34] <silly_girl22> i need help with wine please. i have no sound. does anyone have experience with that problem?
[10:34] <x-r00t-x> hi silly_girl22
[10:35] <silly_girl22> hi
[10:35] <x0x> need helps
[10:35] <christian1222> finalbeta: so this is going to seem dumb, but im really new to linux, do you know where the information page is on how to install tar.gv files
[10:35] <christian1222> finalbeta: sorry, tar.gz
[10:35] <roe> man tar you'll see it
[10:35] <silly_girl22> christian, tar -xzvf *.tar.gz
=== BigToe|22days is now known as ShowerToe
[10:35] <J4kch> How do I get the latest JAVA version (with firefox being able to use it)?
[10:35] <finalbeta> Or just doubleclick the file, it will open in the package manager, unpack it, and read the readme.
[10:35] <x-r00t-x> silly_girl22,  i think wine doesnt have sound :S
[10:36] <Huibert> !java
[10:36] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[10:36] <silly_girl22> a voip program does no good with wine if you have no sound
[10:36] <Jassossovinik> x-r00t-x, I think it does if you configure it
[10:36] <tigsa> silly_girl22, neville?
[10:36] <J4kch> Huibert, danke
[10:36] <Huibert> J4kch: then you can also install the jre firefox plugin with synaptic
[10:36] <agliv5> I tried to install the JRE 5.0 Update 10 using the guide at http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper and it didn't work.  Unfortunately, I don't know what when wrong... can anyone help?
[10:37] <silly_girl22> ventrilo, and no, i dont want to use another program. my friends use this one and i like it.
[10:37] <LjL> x-r00t-x: i prefer beer, too, but then WINE does have sound
[10:37] <x-r00t-x> hmm
[10:38] <LjL> x-r00t-x: if you type "winecfg", you'll see you can configure the sound. perhaps this may help silly_girl22 as well
[10:38] <x0x> i dont have the permission to copy the file which are read only(locked icon by using tree view) and from the root window(gksudo nautilus) the folders(partitions) wasnt there.anyone?
[10:38] <x-r00t-x> i tried out wine . i didnt like it . themes like first version of windows
[10:38] <LjL> x-r00t-x: you can use XP themes
[10:38] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  i have to try again then :D
[10:38] <wildfire_> anyone get banshee to work on xubuntu.. its hanging on sound initialization. =(
[10:38] <Huibert> agliv5: if you don't know what went wrong, how should I know?
[10:38] <Huibert> how am I supposed to help you then??
[10:39] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  on wine ? :O
[10:39] <LjL> x-r00t-x: yes. those i tried (mostly KDE-lookalike themes, to make Windows programs look less out of place) worked very slowly, but perhaps a standard XP theme will do OK
[10:39] <nothlit> msstyles slow apps down
[10:39] <LjL> nothlit: indeed... those i've tried, at least.
[10:39] <wildfire_> tried, 0.11.2 on xubuntu no luck..
[10:40] <nothlit> A lot
[10:40] <tigsa> silly_girl22, ok, i think i know the problem
[10:40] <LjL> but if nothing else, you can change the colors to fit with the rest of your desktop. that's already something
[10:40] <nothlit> btw new wine *26 has better msstyle config in winecfg
[10:40] <m1iguel> hola
[10:40] <tigsa> silly_girl22, the fix is multiple sound programs running at once?
[10:40] <LjL> oh and now that i think of that, actually Edgy's KDE (don't know about Gnome) has a built-in control panel applet for doing exactly that - matching WINE's colors and fonts to KDE's
[10:40] <tigsa> silly_girl22, or the cause rather
[10:40] <nothlit> .9.26
[10:40] <m1iguel> alguien espaol?????
[10:40] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  can you unban me on ubuntu-offtopic. they banned me for my real name.
[10:41] <LjL> !es | m1iguel
[10:41] <ubotu> m1iguel: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[10:41] <zylche> Does anyone know anyway to edit the lock screen? :P
[10:41] <Renan_s2> !paste
[10:41] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:41] <agliv5> Huibert:  the problem apparently is that Ubuntu doesn't know where to look to find the Update (if that makes sense...)
[10:41] <mattsg> anyone help me with installing? I'm trying to install on a USB hard drive, but the installer failed at installing GRUB
[10:41] <m1iguel> oh
[10:41] <Huibert> agliv5: you get update sover synaptic? or some other update?
[10:41] <mattsg> Maybe because I put (sda) instead of /dev/sda? Do I have to redo the installer, or can I set up grub another way and boot normally?
[10:42] <wildfire_> i notice, the same sound initialization problem on ubuntu forum.. but nobody responded.. except for bump. anyone know abit more about banshee than i ?
[10:42] <silly_girl22> any wine users here?
[10:43] <nothlit> <--
[10:43] <nothlit> oh sudo modprobe snd-seq
[10:43] <silly_girl22> nothlit, do you have sound with wine?
[10:43] <nothlit> and you can add snd-seq to /etc/modules
[10:44] <agliv5> Huibert: as the guide states, I downloaded the *.bin via sun's website...  When I run sudo update-alternatives --config java it doesn't list the dirrectory where the update is installed...
[10:44] <nothlit> silly_girl22, i don't get any error messages with sound configuration but no apps i use with wine actually use sound
[10:44] <nothlit> i installed the jack libraries and got /dev/snd working to get rid of the error message
[10:44] <Huibert> agliv5: I'm reading the guide now brb
[10:45] <mattsg> does it do anything important after install grub?
[10:46] <nothlit> if you install the aoss package you could use oss
[10:46] <Huibert> agliv5: this guide does not mention an java .10 update, just .08
[10:46] <Huibert> agliv5: it looks like the guide shows how to overide the exsisting java install with a newer one...
[10:47] <christian1222> what does this mean: 'checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables'
[10:47] <agliv5> Huibert: the problem is that I don't have a /usr/java directory, the previously installed JRE is in /usr/lib/jvm/
[10:47] <jrib> christian1222: what are you trying to compile?
[10:47] <Huibert> agliv5: what is the output of "java -version" on an commandline

[10:47] <Blaize> can anyone help me out getting my dual screen running ?
[10:47] <Huibert> agliv5: the usr/java directory does not look correct to me either

[10:48] <najand> Hi
[10:48] <christian1222> jrib: thanks, i didnt know ubuntu had a package for it
[10:48] <jrib> christian1222: no need to compile, it is in universe.  However so that you know, your error means you don't have a C compiler.  You can install build-essential to get one (as well as other stuff for development)
[10:48] <Huibert> agliv5: ooopps, I just reread the guide concering the "upgrade" procedure
[10:48] <agliv5> Huibert: it's saying java: command not found
[10:49] <christian1222> jrib: once again, thanks
[10:49] <Huibert> agliv5: it upgrade java only for firefox/mozilla
[10:49] <jrib> christian1222: np
[10:49] <wastrel> is there a way to escape a keyboard combination so Gnome will ignore it and pass it through to the terminal (like function keys, ctrl- keys and suchlike?)
[10:50] <Huibert> agliv5: have you installed java as in "http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper#How_to_install_J2SE_Runtime_Environment_.28JRE.29_with_Plug-in_for_Mozilla_Firefox" ?
[10:50] <jrib> wastrel: if it's a gnome-terminal shortcut, get rid of it in the gnome-terminal preferences.  I don't know of a way to escape it
[10:50] <nominal_hilarity> anyone know anything about ActionScript here?
[10:50] <awbassett> Is anyone having issues with us.archive.ubuntu.com? It so, it may be worth putting into the topic, as archive.ubuntu.com works for me.
[10:50] <cafuego_> agliv5: there is a sun-java-5 or somesuch package in multiverse I think.
[10:51] <Huibert> agliv5: it looks like you have no java installed....
[10:51] <nothlit> you have to agree to sun's license or use blackdown jre
[10:51] <christian1222> jrib: are you a software engineer?
[10:51] <Zarephath> anyone heard of a MMORPG for linux named Planeshifter? I have been searching for it, but google isn't finding the website..

[10:52] <Mark45> Hi everyone, why is my internet so slow in ubuntu 6.10?
[10:52] <FirstStrike> Zarephath: It's Planeshift, not Planeshifter
[10:52] <christian1222> jrib: just wondering, i work in hr for google, were always looking for helpful people
[10:52] <Mark45> thanks, I have tried that but it seems to not have worked
[10:52] <Daviey> how can i give other users 'admin' access.  Ie let them control serial port and mount usb filesystems?
[10:52] <Huibert> agliv5: but if java was installed correctly, it should have worked on the command line
[10:52] <Zarephath> LadyNikon, wastrel: Ahh...ok thanks
[10:52] <Budgieman> hi, i've used ubuntu for quite a while, but i've only installed the latest 6.10 version in the last few days, and i'm having some trouble with my video card
[10:52] <kitche> Maek45: do about:config in firefox and look up ipv6 and double click and your net should be faster
[10:52] <christian1222> jrib: ;-D
[10:52] <Raphael> will the new nvidia drivers ever appear in the official ubuntu repos?
[10:53] <Mark45> kitche should it be bold or not?
[10:53] <Budgieman> i'm stuck with a really low resolution, and i can't seem to find the video settings i used in the last few versions
[10:53] <kitche> Mark45: yeah it turns bold after it's turned to true
[10:53] <FirstStrike> Raphael: They're already there.
[10:53] <Budgieman> i'm using an ATI card, which i've heard is widely supported with linux
[10:53] <FirstStrike> Oh, the -new- ones..maybe
[10:53] <Mark45> kitche: so i need to turn it to bold then?
[10:53] <Zarephath> Thanks all..should have known I fscked it up...always turns out to be fat fingers...
[10:53] <jrib> christian1222: Ubuntu's community just makes you want to help people :)
[10:53] <kitche> Mark45: yes if you double click it it shoudl turn false to tru

[10:54] <Mark45> haha thanks
[10:55] <budluva_> lane, i'd say the mirror is down
[10:55] <budluva_> lane, try another mirror
[10:55] <agliv5> Huibert: I agree; however Synaptic says that sun-j2re1.5+update07 is installed...
[10:55] <Mark45> jrib: I have a pretty new computer, could my hardware support the ipv6?
[10:55] <lane> budluva , How would I do that?
[10:55] <awbassett> lane, i removed the us. from my sources.list and everything works fine
[10:56] <SoulOrb> Bye Gentoo, Hello Ubuntu.  Hello everyone.
[10:56] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  how many mb  ram required for ubuntu ? i got 512 mb and i using nothing. memory usage is 80% . what i do
=== ShowerToe is now known as BigToe|22days
[10:56] <budluva_> lane, edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:56] <lane> awbasset,   thank you
[10:56] <pooya> i have attached a usb device to ubuntu, I think its detected, it comes up under lsusb. how can I access it?
[10:56] <bobbyd> hi
[10:56] <LjL> x-r00t-x: 512Mb is fine. the memory usage you see from top, free etc means nothing -- the memory's just being used by the kernel for caching files. it'll free it when applications need it
[10:57] <bobbyd> does anyone know how to set up zeroconf/avahi so I can ping machine.local and it'll work?
[10:57] <x-r00t-x> LjL,  oh i got it
[10:57] <Huibert> agliv5: hmm,
[10:57] <bobbyd> I can browse the machines on the network, but I can't just use their addresses
[10:57] <tonyyarusso> lane: Others have reported issues with the US mirror today (and in the past), btw
[10:57] <Huibert> agliv5: if you rightclick on the package in synaptic, does it list the java binary is installed?
[10:58] <nothlit> Gnome needs that much more ram?
[10:58] <Ali2004> lane: try system->administration->software sources
[10:58] <wildfire_> Anyone use banshee with gnome ?
[10:58] <blameless> bobbyd: you'd have to add the libnss-mdns stuff
[10:58] <agliv5> Huibert: java-package isn't installed
[10:59] <lufis> Which package do I need to compile a program that needs "XScreenSaver Extension"?
[10:59] <Huibert> agliv5: as I wrote, the guide which says to unpack in /usr/java will _not_ give you a working java enviroment
[11:00] <Huibert> agliv5: it's just the browser plugin
[11:00] <pooya> what a phones file system?
[11:00] <lufis> pooya: fat?
[11:00] <Blaize> can anyone try and help me with getting my dual screen working ?
[11:00] <Huibert> agliv5: try an "sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre sun-java5-plugin"
[11:00] <lufis> pooya: Do you mean the filesystem on a phone's flash memory?
[11:01] <pooya> lufis, I am try to connect my phone to ubuntu
[11:01] <pooya> lufis, it comes up under lsubs
[11:01] <lufis> pooya: ah
[11:01] <tanlaan> is anyone else having problems getting to "www.gnome-look.org"?
[11:01] <pooya> lufis, lsusb
[11:01] <pooya> lufis, trying to mount it
[11:01] <lufis> pooya: sorry, you're barking up the wrong tree. I'm a newb myself :(
[11:01] <pooya> lufis, :)
[11:02] <nothlit> pooya, is it UMS compliant?
[11:02] <lufis> pooya: although you could probably just use "auto" for the filesystem
[11:02] <nominal_hilarity> anyone good with Flash/ActionScript?
[11:02] <Ali2004> tanlaan:It does not connect to their server
[11:02] <Blaize> ATI radeon 9800 (128 MB)
[11:02] <Blaize> need help with getting it working with dual screen
[11:02] <agliv5> Huibert: already the newest version
[11:03] <Ali2004> tanlaan: Probably a server crash
[11:03] <hou5ton> anyone know how to make the Win key open Synaptic?>

[11:04] <nothlit> universal mass storage
[11:04] <aarm> i was using debian but thought I would try ubuntu on a second system

[11:04] <nothlit> thats what you need to be able to mount it
[11:04] <Blaize> ATI radeon 9800 (128 MB)     need help with getting it working with dual screen.

[11:04] <Huibert> agliv5: can't help you any further, got to go to sleep  :-)
[11:04] <nothlit> some phones use proprietary drivers to transfer info
[11:05] <nothlit> they don't use UMS
[11:05] <aarm> that's what I think but this source thing is a really bummer
[11:05] <Kira> Hello.
[11:05] <agliv5> Huibert: Thanks for the help :)
[11:05] <dbe> Which layout engine does w3m use?
[11:05] <nothlit> usually gnome-volume-manager should be able to auto mount it if its UMS
[11:05] <tanlaan> Kira: hello :D
[11:05] <gilnim> evenin'
[11:05] <Ali2004> aarm: what about it? (the source)

[11:07] <binarydigit> in apt

[11:07] <aarm> binarydigit: looks like it

[11:08] <wy> Is there a good way to setup wireless lan for ibm think pads? I'm using Intell/Pro
[11:08] <nothlit> lehaid, you need to install the vmware addons
[11:08] <cafuego_> lehaid: You need to install the vmware tools in the guest for that to work
[11:08] <pooya> nothlit, used this : sudo mount -t usbfs /proc/bus/usb/002/004 /mnt/phone
[11:08] <pooya> nothlit, seemed to work
[11:08] <Ali2004> Try to edit /etc/apt/sources.list and remove all "us."
[11:08] <nothlit> lehaid, first install build-essential in the guestos
[11:09] <nothlit> pooya, thats great :)
[11:09] <lehaid> nothlit: i've installed vmware tools
[11:09] <pooya> nothlit, but nothing in the directory..
[11:09] <lehaid> everybody, i INSTALLED VMWARE TOOLS, before installing there was an old version in where that worked
[11:09] <xen> so, quick question, automatix: good or bad?
[11:09] <xzk> nothlit: do you know how to fix a broken clock
[11:09] <LjL> !automatix | xen
[11:09] <ubotu> xen: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[11:09] <lehaid> when i installed the new vmware tools it stoped working
[11:09] <lehaid> do i need to do something abuot it /
[11:09] <WilderSon> hello, does anyone know where or how to get the dvb-dev package?

[11:11] <LjL> DrNic1: go to #ubuntu-xgl
[11:11] <Ali2004> ubotu: I agree with you on Automatix
[11:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I agree with you on Automatix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:11] <nothlit> lehaid, thats the only way

[11:11] <darfy> Hello all. I've got a soundcards question. I've got two soundcards A and B. My speakers are one A. I want to play line-in from B in speakers (on A). How can I dot this ?
[11:11] <lehaid> nothlit: yes it doesnt work... what to check for ? vmware-stats tells me it's good
[11:11] <aarm> thanks for the news....good luck all
[11:11] <nothlit> then you didn't install it correctly
[11:11] <Ali2004> Now that
[11:12] <lehaid> they add more stuff, like networking & shared dir support
[11:12] <Ali2004> LOL :)
[11:12] <nothlit> try again and make sure the compilation parts worked properly
[11:12] <lehaid> nothlit: what could i have done wrong for example ? any ubnutu - specific isntructions ? cause the script went ok
[11:12] <nothlit> and did you do a restart of the virtual machine
[11:12] <amattas> I'm not an ubuntu user, I'm a gentoo user, and I kind of figured out how Synaptic works, but I have no idea why it keeps failing the refresh is gets xx% done and just hangs
[11:13] <nothlit> there isn't anything special for ubuntu, just installing build-essential and maybe the linux headers
[11:13] <lehaid> what do you people get when you run "runlevel" ?
[11:13] <nothlit> you didn't skip any options?
[11:13] <Discerer> what IRCd do you suggest I get? I dont need one that can handle clustered networks but it should be good and powerful

[11:25] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: look for any channels that have MM at the bottom
[11:26] <wceoscar> ok i found some
[11:26] <hou5ton> jeeeezzzzzzzz, this is nuts ...... there has to be a way to change the behavior of the Win key!??
[11:26] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: which ones?
[11:26] <lehaid> which XORG is included in ubnutu 6.06.1 ?
[11:26] <gumpa> Howdy. I'm dealing with a failed Dapper->Edgy upgrade. Did it via sources.list. dist-upgrade fails with 'too many errors'
[11:26] <wceoscar> IE958
[11:26] <fdoving> lehaid: you can check that yourself at http://packages.ubuntu.com
[11:26] <kr0n1x> where i can get tcl8.5-dev and tk8.5-dev without synaptic/apt? i need source packages
[11:27] <gumpa> on a Thinkpad R51
[11:27] <ethos> How would I troubleshoot SIOCGIFFLAGS devices?
[11:27] <fdoving> kr0n1x: http://packages.ubuntu.com
[11:27] <kr0n1x> i'm trying
[11:27] <bam_> or maybe you guys could help. I have set up a "iptables" firewall where everything is "dropped" except input on TCP port 21 and output on TCP port 21, but still I cant connect to my ftp server. Any ideas on what could be wrong?
[11:27] <kr0n1x> fdoving can u help me?
[11:27] <wceoscar> optokalmouse, the channel is IE958
[11:27] <gumpa> loading hardware drivers fails, no NIC
[11:27] <wceoscar> IEC958
[11:27] <lehaid> does ubuntu's XORG come with VMMOUSE?
[11:27] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: erm, that one shouldn't matter
[11:28] <gumpa> suggestions? is there a package i could install from an Edgy CD to restore drivers?
[11:28] <wceoscar> whats the prob then???????????
[11:28] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: does the sound work regularly?
[11:28] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: ok
[11:28] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: you have the volume control
[11:28] <Discerer> there is no package with an ircd =/
[11:29] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: right click on it and click Preferences
[11:29] <optikalmouse> select whichever device the speaker cord is plugged into
[11:29] <malt> anyone here use dd wrt for firmware on there router?
[11:29] <optikalmouse> and then choose the track Master
[11:29] <Sinistrad> bam_, you probably need port 20 open also, and also allow anything in an established or related state.
[11:29] <fdoving> kr0n1x: newest tcl in edgy is 8.4
[11:30] <gumpa> malt, what's your dd-wrt question?
[11:30] <wceoscar> ok
[11:30] <kr0n1x> also beta fdoving , i don't care
[11:30] <kr0n1x> now i've tcl8.5a5, but i need -dev package also
[11:30] <kr0n1x> exist it?
[11:30] <wceoscar> i did taht
[11:30] <bam_> I'll give port 20 a try,thx
[11:30] <Comrade_S> Discerer:  just go to the unreal website, download the package and install. its not the difficult, I configured and run unreal in 30 minutes
[11:31] <Sinistrad> bam_, are the clients able to connect to the server or do they timeout? do they timeout during a specific operation after they're connected?
[11:31] <x0x> anyone know how to change file permissions using sudo
[11:31] <malt> gumpa: i installed dd wrt and it worked, and now i seen where i could upgrade the memory on the router using dd wrt to 64 mb well i tryed the command it said, and now i can't connect to the router at all, and i'm wired to the router, i tryed the reset button no the router and nothing still
[11:31] <malt> on*
[11:32] <silly_girl22> is ubuntu dapper drake using alsa by default instead of oss?
[11:32] <lehaid> what is the program i need to run in X to check that all my mouse buttons are sending proper events ?
[11:32] <bam_> well, they get to the poing where they browser askes for a password, but after that nothing.
[11:32] <bam_> *point
[11:32] <wceoscar> what should i do?????????????????????
[11:32] <erUSUL> bam_: you need two ports for ftp 20 and 21 afaik http://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html
[11:32] <erUSUL> silly_girl22: yes
[11:32] <bam_> ok
[11:32] <Comrade_S> x0x:  "chmod *** /path/to/file"
[11:32] <gumpa> malt, are you doing the 30 second reset? turn on with reset pushed, hold it for 30s
[11:32] <optikalmouse> wceoscar: and that should work?
[11:32] <optikalmouse> and i'm outta here
[11:32] <optikalmouse> cya
[11:32] <Sinistrad> bam_, opening 20 will probably help.
[11:32] <Comrade_S> x0x:  replace *** with permissions
[11:32] <malt> gumpa does this work with dd wrt?
[11:33] <malt> gumpa: you think maybe i have screwed my router up?
[11:33] <x0x> ok. e.g. ?
[11:33] <gumpa> malt, that's what I've found required after firmware changes, all settings are lost
[11:33] <gumpa> but ip address is restored, can reset
[11:33] <Comrade_S> x0x:  eg? 666? 777?
[11:33] <wceoscar> ive try almot everithing
[11:33] <salkot> Is there any way to automatically give nm-applet access to my keyring? I don't like typing in the password every boot.
[11:33] <malt> gumpa: so reset button does nothing?
[11:34] <malt> with ddwrt?
[11:34] <gumpa> malt, it does a couple things depending on the situation, the 30second usage is needed after firmware change
[11:34] <gumpa> there's another version, hold reset, power up and wait 5 seconds
[11:34] <Discerer> ok Comrade_S... but is it GOOD? don't really care if it's easy to install, just want it to be fast, have nice modding features etc
[11:35] <malt> Dude i just tryed a command i went by on a tutorial to put ram to 16mb, and router rebooted, and now i can't connect to router at all, can't even ping 192.168.1.1
[11:35] <x0x> Comrade_S, i mean sudo chmod whattotype /media/sda1
[11:35] <tryxter> hi everyone
[11:35] <tryxter> whats the best mp3 player
[11:35] <tryxter> for ubuntu edgy?
[11:35] <Comrade_S> Discerer:  yes, its good, I tihnk its the most popular one too
[11:35] <Discerer> ok nice
[11:36] <malt> gumpa: you think i might have perm messed up my router?
[11:36] <Sinistrad> x0x, man chmod.  It depends on what permissions you want to change. (e.g.: to disable writing for everyone: chmod -w /some/file )
[11:36] <Discerer> I looked up IRCD-hybrid and UnrealIRCd and unreal has a much geekier webpage so I think I'll go with that
[11:36] <x0x> oo
[11:36] <Discerer> thanks for the help Comrade_S
[11:36] <gumpa> malt, so you have done the 30s reset?
[11:36] <x0x> hwhw
[11:36] <eloquence_> sup everybody
[11:36] <x0x> heheh
[11:36] <Lamego> Discerer, also is much more bugged :)
[11:36] <x0x> forgot the parameter
[11:36] <Comrade_S> Discerer:  if you need help with it, just ask me, I am the maintianer of peekko and I run the peekko irc server
[11:37] <Discerer> Lamego hm?
[11:37] <Discerer> kk comr
[11:37] <gumpa> malt, there are several more things to try to salvage the router,
[11:37] <Lamego> Discerer, unreal is know to be the most featured ircd, but also the one having more bugs :)
[11:37] <malt> gumpa: know any?
[11:37] <gumpa> i don't know them off-hand, the last one involves opening and shorting pins
[11:37] <bam_> :( I still get the same results, even when both port 20 and 21 are open both in and out. Any other suggestions?
[11:37] <gumpa> malt, gotta get at the dd-wrt website
[11:38] <Sinistrad> bam_, do you have any other services that work?
[11:38] <gumpa> a problem if the router is bricked :-\
[11:38] <Discerer> hehe ok Lamego... but I guess if you only use the core features you should be ok right? :)
[11:38] <malt> there is nothing i can do from my pc to the router gumpa i can't even connect to the router at all, i'm on a old router now
[11:38] <Lamego> Discerer, i think so
[11:38] <Sinistrad> bam_, also note that the chains are checked in order (from top to bottom), so if you have something dropping packets before it gets to your allow rule, they'll get dropped.
[11:39] <gumpa> malt, do you have physical access?
[11:39] <_Fa|CoNe_> Hey There
[11:39] <m0dY> is there a way to control things when doing apt-get update and it hangs with a certain step
[11:39] <Sinistrad> bam_, additionally, you probably need to have a rule that accepts anything in an ESTABLISHED or RELATED state.
[11:39] <bam_> I have a couple of other services that work fine. Webmin on port 11000, ssh, gnump3d on port 4444. All work great.
[11:39] <m0dY> it hangs in this "99% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (146.137.96.15)"
[11:39] <xen> I'm having a lot of static and audio artifacts while on Edgy...anyone got any advice?  I couldn't find anything on UbuntuForums
[11:39] <malt> gumpa: yeah i can kick it :P
[11:39] <gumpa> malt, what router is it?
[11:39] <malt> its a linksys wrt54g v5
[11:39] <Sinistrad> bam_, consider using a command-line ftp client in PASV mode for your test...
[11:40] <eloquence_> moo
[11:40] <eloquence_> muu
[11:40] <eloquence_> mew
[11:40] <IndyGUnFreak> anyone else having trouble installing from the repositories today?
[11:40] <gumpa> malt, that's what I've been working with I don't know about ram issues, just dd-wrt version updating
[11:40] <salkot> IndyGUnFreak, it sounds like m0dy is
[11:40] <m0dY> is there a way to control things when doing apt-get update and it hangs with a certain step, it hangs in this "99% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (146.137.96.15)"
[11:40] <m0dY> * Marsmensch has joined #ubuntu
[11:40] <peder_> How can I see whats running in port 110?
[11:41] <Comrade_S> IndyGUnFreak:  I heard the US servers are down
[11:41] <IndyGUnFreak> i'm just not connecting for some reason, at least i know its just not me.
[11:41] <IndyGUnFreak> ok, it scool.
[11:41] <bam_> I'm sitting on Ubuntu 6.06. Could I maybe use the native ftp service on ubuntu?
[11:41] <eloquence_> IndyGUnFreak: i am installing my kernel headers as we speak
[11:41] <malt> gumpa: its not a ram issue now its a issue to try and get the router back working ;/ a reset issue now
[11:41] <eloquence_> but i am on dial up so i dunno everything is prob for me
[11:41] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm, i tried to install acid rip, and it tried to connect and just completely stalled.
[11:41] <Marsmensch> m0dY: ?
[11:41] <drucer> Interesting, I wonder if Mark Shuttleworth knows that other project - Nexenta (that is Solaris project) is using Ubuntu software repositories.
[11:41] <gumpa> malt, again, you've done the 30s reset ...
[11:41] <IndyGUnFreak> tried through automatix2, same prob... stalled as it attempted to connect to us servers
[11:42] <malt> gumpa let me try again brb in 5 min
[11:42] <Comrade_S> m0dY:  I heard the US servers is down, so just "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list" and remove the us from us.archive.ubuntu.com
[11:42] <Sinistrad> bam_, I think you misunderstood -- for your client tests, use the comand-line "ftp" command...after you enter your username/password (if it actually connects and gives you a prompt of some kind) type in "PASV" and see if you can do file transfers that way
[11:42] <m0dY> Comrade_S, mmm.. i c

[11:43] <tonyyarusso> drucer: I'm sure someone's mentioned it
[11:43] <Comrade_S> m0dY:  dont forget to run "sudo apt-get update" after you edit the sources.list
[11:43] <m0dY> where could i get a bunch of mirrors to put so incase some are down ?!
[11:44] <bam_> oh, the way I have been trying to connect is via Opera and firefox by the address "ftp://user@address". Then I get a promt for a password for the user and then .....nothing.
[11:44] <Sinistrad> bam_, which is why you should use the command-line client...you'll probably get something better than nothing (at least, an error message)
[11:44] <IndyGUnFreak> comrad, will that work, just removing the US?
[11:44] <Comrade_S> m0dY:  I have no idea but I am guessing the mirros are us.archive.ubuntu.com   eu.archive.ubuntu.com archive.ubuntu.com
[11:45] <bam_> ok, I will give it a try.
[11:45] <grndslm> anybody here use ubuntu on an ASUS laptop??

[11:45] <rukuartic> Does anyone know if VFAT uses journaling?
=== Plouj-_ is now known as Plouj
[11:46] <Sinistrad> rukuartic, it does not.
[11:46] <rukuartic> Sinistrad: Wohoo! Is there any way it could be activated, or is it just not a feature?
[11:46] <Sinistrad> rukuartic, just not a feature.
[11:46] <rukuartic> Sinistrad: I know it is in ext3, is it enabled in Eft by default?
[11:47] <blakkinferno> When it says how to install beryl at http://forum.beryl-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=51, what do they mean "Sign it with"?
[11:47] <Sinistrad> rukuartic, VFAT doesn't support journaling.  ext3 does (and if your filesystems are ext3, they have a journal...otherwise they're ext2)
[11:47] <m0dY> Comrade_S, one more thing, what if i want apt-get to do move to other mirror if it hangs with some certain mirror
[11:47] <LinXway> I have a printer issue mabye some one can help me with...I have a hp t65 all in one printer when I installed it under gnome it all went fine the printer add recognized it and it worked...but for some reason I cannot get kde to diplay in the printer add section a list of hp printer it will only show 4 laser printer in the list and what has me confused is I goto printer system settings click on add printer the wizard pops up I click 
[11:47] <LinXway> ceJet_T_Series?device=/dev/parport0 so I am thinking it recognized the printer but then i click next and then it asks for mfg so I click on the hp tab and it only shows the 4 laser printers as choices ???can some one explain to me why KDE cannot do what gnome can do?
[11:47] <blakkinferno> kitche: hey, u on?
[11:48] <blakkinferno> kitche: Hey, im back hehe.
[11:48] <m0dY> i now have 2 mirror places in my sources.list
[11:48] <blakkinferno> When it says how to install beryl at http://forum.beryl-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=51, what do they mean "Sign it with"?
[11:48] <grndslm> anybody here use ubuntu on an ASUS laptop??
[11:48] <jhall> I have general question... what could cause a socket to not be established (via root)? I can establish one on 127.0.0.1 but not my actual ip address
[11:49] <Sinistrad> rukuartic, if you want a journaled filesystem that's accessible by windows servers, use NTFS.
[11:49] <Comrade_S> m0dY:  you just have to edit your sources.list and change that entry to the next mirror. The servers are rarely down(never seen them down ever) so its just a one itme thing
[11:49] <rukuartic> Sinistrad: Naw I don't want a journaling filesystem.
[11:49] <Sinistrad> rukuartic, then what're you asking about journals for :)
[11:50] <malt> gumpa: tryed it and no luck, the router is not even listening to me, it was showing ethernet ports in use. when i had them both unpluged, and it still showing them in use
[11:50] <rukuartic> Sinistrad: I'm not the biggest fan. Just got a USB drive and was wondering about it.
[11:50] <LADoctor> hi what is the difference between ubuntu, kubuntu, edubuntu, and xubuntu
[11:50] <Sinistrad> rukuartic, yeah -- journaling is not possible with vfat, then.
[11:50] <m0dY> Comrade_S, okay
[11:50] <varsendaggr> ak whenever i move firefox around my google video stops
[11:50] <m0dY> but i thought apt was a bit smarter =(
[11:50] <malt> gumpa: any other ideas?
[11:51] <finalbeta_> blakkinferno, It just means that you add a key on your PC for the repository you will be using. It's telling ubuntu that the repository holds packages you trust( simple way of putting it)
[11:51] <bam_> Sinistrad: Your were totally right, but everything works great without the -p (passive) option on the ftp. I get connected and can see all the home area. What could be wrong? Is it the browsers faults or what?
[11:51] <Sinistrad> bam_, did you test a file transfer on the command-line?
[11:51] <varsendaggr> any ideas on how to fix this?      it will play for 1 second at a time unless i relaod the whole video...
[11:52] <bam_> no, :-|, let me try that.
[11:52] <Discerer> Comrade_S; the installation asks if I want to install as a hub or as a leaf, but offers no explanation. What does it mean?
[11:52] <Sinistrad> bam_, (I assume that you're testing command-line and browser on the same client system)

[11:53] <nikin> agains all waht i said befora about edgy, i hail it for working Debian Menu under windowmaker
[11:54] <mattsg> can someone help me? I'm following the guide at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=80811 but there's no rescue mode, and more importantly no /etc/makeinitramfs
[11:54] <bam_> yes, I have now tested file transfer and it works on the command-line. Got the whole fil without any errors....
[11:54] <Sinistrad> bam_, then it ought to work with opera :)
[11:55] <Comrade_S> Discerer: just chhose hub(that option is for big networks, leaf means usually, you are connecting to a bigg servera leaf/mirror to a bigger server. hub means you are the bigger server or only server)
[11:55] <Sinistrad> bam_, does "lsmod|grep ftp" (on the server) show anything?
[11:55] <Sinistrad> bam_, there is an ip_conntrack_ftp module that I've heard should be loaded when doing ftp firewalling stuff...

[11:59] <Windy> i've always just done sudo
[11:59] <LjL> blakkinferno: read the page ubotu gave you - it explains it
[11:59] <Windy> there's probably a reason to it somewhere
[11:59] <blakkinferno> okay, so ill just use sudo. ANd ill read it, LjL
[11:59] <blakkinferno> thanks
[11:59] <LjL> Windy: yes, sudo doesn't always work with GUI programs
[11:59] <Windy> i think gksudo is more secure or something
[11:59] <Sinistrad> gksudo will graphically prompt for a password (and probably does some other environmental things related to the X environment)
[11:59] <james> Sinistrad: yes thanks - i see what you mean!
[12:00] <james> is that by design?  seems like a pretty crazy implementation :)
[12:00] <blakkinferno> okay, ill use gksudo then
[12:00] <Sinistrad> james, it is...
[12:00] <mcphail> Windy: don't use sudo with graphical apps. It can mess up permissions on important files
[12:00] <james> excellent, thanks a lot for the help
[12:00] <amattas> Is there a fix for the Powernowd problems with various dell's, I've seen lots of forums and such but no definitive answer
[12:00] <Windy> ah, good thing i found that out BEFORE i tried it with graphical apps
[12:00] <Sinistrad> james, Scrollbars like that are part of some commonly-used library (lesstif?) so you'll run into them quite often
[12:00] <Windy> on the bright side, most graphical apps i've got don't need me to hop into terminal
[12:01] <james> cool, good to know
