[12:01] <lee2> tried, its aparently stupidly simple
[12:01] <mc44> shwag: yep
[12:01] <cobra_> Trainstroker: usually restart the computer. But you could press ALT+F2 and then use the command "nm-applet"
[12:01] <Dan_Edin> yay i found the netinstall of ubuntu. uses only 9mb
[12:01] <shwag> mc44: that works for Xeons ?
[12:01] <mc44> shwag: on edgy and later the kernel is called generic and has smp by defaut
[12:01] <kevin> what is a really good distro to run on a P2 with 728 ram, that needs to be on a samba network, hold lots of files in either ntfs or ext3 on two disk drives, and is easy for a n00b to set up? --does this even exist?
[12:01] <lee2> how do i just list all the network adapaters in a console in ubuntu ?
[12:01] <mc44> shwag: should do, yes
[12:01] <shwag> mc44: good info. thanks.
[12:01] <cobra_> kevin: ubuntu
[12:01] <hjmills> lee2, try using lspci if its a pci device or ifconfig - both require some filtering

[12:02] <lee2> hjmills, its pci.
[12:02] <lee2> whats the wireless client in ubuntu

[12:02] <Trainstroker> cobra_: its not working ><
[12:02] <kevin> is x or ice less cpu intensive?
[12:02] <hjmills> kevin, the official stuff is best as some of the wiki is out of date but the official help docs doesn't cover everything so you will need wiki for some stuff
[12:03] <Trainstroker> cobra_: alaa_ said to use synaptic to dl it. i did along wit the gnome frontend.... i dunno how to launch it
[12:03] <hjmills> kevin, you mean icewm? that runs on top of x

[12:03] <kitche> LaserLine: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop

[12:04] <Trainstroker> cobra_:

[12:07] <hjmills> kevin, sometimes its just x that locks so press Ctrl + Alt + Backspace to restart X - you lose programs tho...
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[12:07] <kitche> kevin: you sure linux locks up or X?

[12:07] <econobeing> i didn't get ndiswrapper off of aptitude or synaptic or whichever, i downloaded it from the site and compiled it, thats the only way i could get it to work
[12:07] <kevin> kitche: not sure,
[12:08] <lxuser_> why it reads cds and not DVD
[12:08] <econobeing> cobra_: do you remember that one thing you told me to download that i didn't have?(for ndiswrapper)
[12:08] <econobeing> i already forgot ._.
[12:08] <lxuser_> have a dvd writer and it detetct the disc
[12:08] <kitche> kevin: if you can alt+ctrl+f2 or f1 and able to type in the console it's probably X
[12:09] <kevin> hjmills: so if ctrl alt bkspace, f1,f2 didn't work, its not x?
[12:09] <lxuser_> someone want too a poor noob
[12:09] <Hova> how do i , have universe and multiverse repositories enabled
[12:09] <lxuser_> somebody

[12:09] <lxuser_> direct chat
[12:10] <econobeing> i really need to write down how i fixed these problems...because i forget how immediately after
[12:10] <LaserLine> I installed the server version of ubuntu, but I want to use the gui desktop/gnome, so I sudo apt-get installed ubuntu-desktop and gdm...now when it boots it says X: cannot stat /etc/X11/X (No such file or directory), aborting.  Is there something else I need to install?
[12:10] <strav> hi there... I just updated to edgy (along with kernel 2.6.17_10) although, I'm experiencing some delays (kinda freeze) apparently due to some energy saving settings on my processor or perhaps something else. Is there a module I can unload or any kernel patch I should use to fix this behavior (didn't encountered this in kernel 2.6.15)
[12:10] <kitche> lxuser_: it's a dvd movie?
=== DARKGuy is now known as DARKGuy_Away
[12:10] <vonderer> is my question too stupid?
[12:10] <Hova>  universe and multiverse repositories , hpow do i enable it
[12:10] <econobeing> Hova: open synaptic > settings > repositories and enable multiverse and universe

[12:27] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[12:28] <AdamKili> TiG4: well you might want to try it, it pretty easy to do, but I don't know much about it so don't trust me. just a suggestion
[12:28] <dm> x-r00t-x ..
[12:28] <Anarch> !EasySource
[12:28] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[12:28] <we2by> I'm luving it
[12:28] <x-r00t-x> !bluetooth | dm
[12:28] <strav> prob is when I go back, I encounter an error at startup saying: cannot load hardware drivers. Apparently it causes no harm but few hours ago, my processor just ran like crazy and heaten up so I'm kinda worry now about this "hardware driver problem"
[12:28] <shwag> mc44: im running off that kernel now, but mysql still seems to only be using one processor. top shows 1 processor taking the whole load.
[12:28] <dm> x-r00t-x i got that part... but it wont connect to my phone
[12:28] <soundray> pielgrzym: this depends entirely on what you perceive as a "big vulnerability"
[12:28] <Gumby> Hova: and I am guessing that you chose method2?
[12:29] <soundray> we2by: is that Quod Libet?
[12:29] <x-r00t-x> dm,  viist here and flow this step https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[12:29] <Svoloch> fidonet live??? who use golded+?
[12:29] <we2by> soundray, yep :)
[12:29] <mc44> shwag: what does cat /proc/cpuinfo give?
[12:29] <funkyHat> grr
[12:29] <we2by> it is simple yet powerfull
[12:29] <AngryElf> what's ubuntu got in the category of "automatic music looker upper and then fix tags correctly"
[12:29] <blekos> soundray, I dont know if you have heard of Remote Administrator Prog (win) but apart from remote desktop is there any other prog so u can actually control you pc remotely (eg. if someone was sitting in front of your PC, he could actually see mouse moving)
[12:29] <soundray> we2by: I'll give it a try then, too
[12:29] <pielgrzym> soundray: by huge vunerability I mean something like using IE without any firewall or so ;)
[12:29] <Hova> Gumby: Method 1: Installing Edgy's Included Driver (8.28.8)
[12:29] <we2by> I like the extra queue window
[12:29] <soundray> blekos: vnc
[12:30] <dm> x-r00t-x i connect a bluetooth mouse that way, but it does not connect to my phone. nm ill try searching around a bit more.
[12:30] <pielgrzym> soundray: generally lots of peeps leave their ssh ports open :) or is there a way to stealth it and make it accessible? :)
[12:30] <funkyHat> I'm getting an MD5sum mismatch with security.ubuntu.com and a bad key from archive.ubuntu.com.... should I be worried?
[12:30] <Gumby> Hova: the commands you posted a few mins ago were from method2
[12:30] <Hova> Gumby: im now on ,Installing the new driver
[12:30] <Hova> Download the ATI driver installer: ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run (this installer is for 32bit and 64bit systems)
[12:30] <soundray> pielgrzym: you can implement "knocking" on some firewalls.
[12:30] <Hova> Gumby:no
[12:30] <we2by> any one experiencing azureus crash on Ubuntu edgy?
[12:30] <Gumby> Hova: that is in the method2 section
[12:30] <x-r00t-x> dm,  try ubuntuforum
[12:31] <Gumby> Hova: yes, read the page carefully
[12:31] <blekos> and how can it be used from a winXP pc?
[12:31] <soundray> pielgrzym: I don't worry about the slight chance of a remotely exploitable ssh bug and just leave the port open.
[12:31] <strav> x-r00t-x, perhaps you know about this hardware driver issue?
[12:31] <soundray> blekos: with vncviewer
[12:31] <pielgrzym> soundray: what you mean by 'knocking'? That it gives an attacker a clue that my linux box is alive?
[12:31] <pielgrzym> soundray: what bug? :>
[12:31] <blekos> i c
[12:31] <chable> hm
[12:31] <soundray> blekos: vnc is cross-platform. There is even a BeOS and a Palm client
[12:31] <blekos> thnx soundray
[12:31] <blekos> !!!
[12:31] <x-r00t-x> strav, no i do not

[12:32] <Anarch> !Synaptic
[12:32] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[12:32] <shwag> mc44: four processors...alld Intel Xeon CPU 4.00GHz
[12:32] <blekos> so, I go to my work download vnc and it just plays...
[12:32] <blekos> i got dyndns for my linux lap
[12:32] <mc44> shwag: then the are all recognisedand should be working :)
[12:32] <AdamKili> i have a very strange error: whenever I press 'up' in nautilus or open a folder, it plays the ubuntu log in music! any help? it's very annoying
[12:32] <soundray> pielgrzym: it responds with the usual "access denied" as you ssh to it for the first time. But then, within a certain time window, you get a chance to connect.
[12:32] <Gumby> Hova: anything to do with downloading the driver from the ati website has to do with method2 not method1.  method2 starts at the step where it edits /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:33] <shwag> mc44: it showed all four before I installed that kernel though.
[12:33] <maria> ol
[12:33] <x-r00t-x> blekos,  good work :P
[12:33] <aluno_> fala ai
[12:33] <Hova> Gumby:I insted it ok the oafter the reboot whe took of from were i left i read,,,,,Installing the new driver
[12:33] <shwag> mc44: /proc/cpuinfo  always shows the hardware...but not if the linux kernel is using it.
[12:33] <pielgrzym> soundray: I don't get it? Mine responds "fine, connect" because I need to acess it ;)
[12:33] <soundray> budw: it's called something else now, and you can download a free trial ;)
[12:33] <blekos> :)
[12:33] <shwag> mc44: uname -a   shows  2.6.15-27-686 #1 SMP PREEMPT   now though.
[12:33] <Hova> Gumby:seems like it ws my mistake
[12:33] <Hova> ,not to install beryl,
[12:34] <Hova> hope it works
[12:34] <Gumby> Hova: if you have done method 1 and method 2 then you are going to have to gack out of the method2 steps.  I can guide you along if you wish
[12:34] <soundray> pielgrzym: if my explanation wasn't simple enough, I'm sure you can find another on the web if you search for "port knocking"
[12:34] <shwag> mc44: but before it was  2.6.15-26-server #1 SMP
[12:34] <mc44> shwag: ah you were running the server kernel
[12:34] <pielgrzym> soundray: is port knocking called also 'syn scanning'? :)
[12:34] <ace0174> Heres my story: tried to install desktop 64bit but it crashed as gnome would load. Then tried to use alternate, installed in text mode (and screwed my win boot), but when starting gdm it hanged again. So i tried dpkg-reconfigure xorg and it didnt make any difference. Could somebody point out what would make X hang? I have a screen. Text mode works fine.
[12:34] <Anarch> Some sysadmin put "deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free" in an Ubuntu sources.list.  That's Bad, right?

[12:38] <Hova> can you join me in #Gumby
[12:38] <soundray> budw: found it: it's called ZETA now

[12:38] <J4kc1> I need to reconfigure xserv
[12:38] <sirjinx> Hi, can someone help me with my laptop? Well, I mostly need to know how to start the powermanagement program from the command line.

[12:40] <ace0174> soundray
[12:40] <budw> soundray: thanks
[12:40] <jeme> anybody may call me?
[12:40] <soundray> jeme: reboot in recovery mode and set your user password with 'passwd username'
[12:41] <jeme> I did it but when I return to the graphic screen it happens the same
[12:41] <soundray> ace0174: so you have the NVidia binary driver already?
[12:41] <ace0174> well i did regular installation
[12:41] <ace0174> it would hang on live cd so i installed text mode trhough alternate
[12:42] <jeme> I can loog in the text mode normally but the problem is when i try to enter in the graphic mode
[12:42] <ace0174> and the same bug showed up when starting it
[12:42] <soundray> jeme: oh, so the password is correct, but you still can't log in. Switch to a console (Ctrl-Alt-F1), log in there and examine your $HOME/.xsession-errors
[12:42] <ace0174> thats the problem
[12:42] <ace0174> i cant
[12:42] <ace0174> it freezes

[12:46] <ZeuGiRDoR> I have an usb bluetooth adapter (Conceptronic cbt200u2) on Edgy, when I plug in, it's recognised by bluetooth daemon, but in bluetooth obex client I can't see any devices. What happens?
[12:47] <soundray> ZeuGiRDoR: you need to run some userspace commands in order to associate with a device. Ubotu has details:
[12:47] <soundray> !bluetooth | ZeuGiRDoR
[12:47] <ubotu> ZeuGiRDoR: For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup

[12:48] <blekos> do i need somehow to enable vnc  server. I've gone to remote desktop and chose enable remote connection etc
[12:49] <soundray> blekos: you probably have to open the port on your router/firewall
[12:49] <kevin> does 6.06 use much less resources than 6.1?
[12:49] <quik_> hey folks
[12:49] <quik_> pop quiz: rsync or unison?
[12:50] <soundray> blekos: btw, it's not recommended to use unencrypted vnc over the internet. Look into ssh tunneling
[12:50] <kevin> yes
[12:50] <blekos> i c
[12:51] <_Brandon_> did someone gets acx100 driver to works?
[12:51] <soundray> kevin: 6.06 does not use fewer resources than 6.10 -- I'd say they are roughly equal

[12:55] <notwist> like that then?

[12:55] <soundray> notwist: might do. Do look at the script, though, and never trust anyone on IRC blindly.

[01:14] <dm> soundray better
[01:14] <Gumby> use fglrxinfo to make sure :)
[01:14] <dm> soundray
[01:14] <soundray> dm: no, you're not describing a problem.
[01:15] <LjL> cmweb: err, if the CD image that you download from the Ubuntu site is bootable (and it is), then of course the resulting CD will be bootable
[01:15] <dm> I need help with obex transfers to my new Moto razr v3r, can anyone help me with how to do so, Obex is confusing and Bitpim does not support my phone
[01:15] <cmweb> the one i made wont boot by the towers cd-rom
[01:15] <Hova> Gumby:I know thanks
[01:15] <Hova> OpenGL renderer string: RADEON 9550 Generic
[01:15] <LjL> cmweb: make sure you burn in SAO (aka DAO) mode, i don't think you should need to do anything else special
[01:16] <LjL> cmweb: the command line i use normally is cdrecord -sao -speed=8 -data imagefile.iso
[01:16] <cmweb> ok im copying over my other cd to the pc then im going to burn a fresh
[01:16] <cmweb> oh, i need to create an ISO?
[01:17] <LjL> cmweb: ... create? i'm talking about the ISO of the Server CD that you downloaded from the Ubuntu site
[01:17] <Gumby> Hova: you should now follow the howto @ http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/XGL  I'd join #ubuntu-xgl and #beryl for help also
[01:17] <LjL> if you don't have that image, then well, i suppose it won't be easy to burn it
[01:17] <cmweb> ljl, i downloaded that a wile ago i only have the cd now and the iso got wiped with my last reformat. so i only have the cd its self
[01:18] <nolimitsoya> is there any type of crossfeedplugin for amarok?
[01:18] <LjL> cmweb: well what i would do is take an ISO from the CD and then burn the ISO, but then i'm sure gnomebaker or k3d or any of those GUI programs will allow for a more straightforward process. just make sure you select all options that make the copy be as much as the original as possible
[01:18] <cmweb> ljl, do you know of an ISO creator?
[01:19] <cmweb> ljl, copy that
[01:19] <LjL> cmweb: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/CD-Writing-HOWTO-4.html#ss4.7
[01:19] <Rasta> wich would be a good virtualization software so i can emulate windows on ubuntu?
[01:20] <LjL> Rasta: qemu or vmware
[01:20] <nolimitsoya> Rasta, vmware
[01:20] <cmweb> !wine
[01:20] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[01:20] <kevin> why would you want to do that?
[01:20] <Rasta> ok, vmware player then
[01:21] <lee2> hi
[01:21] <LjL> Rasta: www.easyvmx.com can be handy with the player
[01:21] <carzzz215> :)
[01:21] <nomin-> has anyone in here installed mythtv?
[01:21] <LjL> !anyone
[01:21] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[01:21] <LjL> Ubotu, tell nomin- about mythtv | nomin-, see the private message from Ubotu
[01:21] <lee2> why is the refresh rate so low ?
[01:21] <DARKGuy_Away> Wait, VMWare Player? so, like, wtf? you emulate your actual windows partition or download an image or something? or does it require something in special?

[01:21] <Rasta> LjL, nice that looks good, thanks dude
[01:22] <x-r00t-x> .
[01:22] <holycow> lee2, you don't have the horizontal and vertical refresh rates in yhour xorg.conf file
[01:22] <LjL> DARKGuy: you need a virtual HD, i.e. an image, yes. in theory you could also start it from the real partition, but in practice Windows doesn't like that at all
[01:22] <nomin-> I installed mythtv but it's recording from the microphone in.  What can I do to have mythtv use the line-in as the recording source?
[01:22] <cappicrd> hey
[01:22] <redblue`> hi
[01:22] <lee2> the problem is, when i goto pure linux the monitor says "out of range" and i cant see a thing
[01:22] <holycow> lee2, google up your monitor model, find out h and v refresh rates and change them in xorg.conf, then logout and log back in
[01:22] <lee2> the resolution is fine though, in desktop mode
[01:22] <DARKGuy> LjL: But the image isn't created with free software, or am I wrong?
[01:22] <holycow> lee2, refresh rates
[01:22] <holycow> just do what i told you
[01:22] <dm> I need help with obex transfers to my new Moto razr v3r, can anyone help me with how to do so, Obex is confusing and Bitpim does not support my phone
[01:22] <lee2> 60,70
[01:22] <holycow> lee2, no
[01:23] <holycow> google your monitor model
[01:23] <LjL> DARKGuy: it can be create with free software for that matter (qemu can make it for instance). i normally just create it using the www.easyvmx.com site. but who cares anyway? vmware itself is not free software
[01:23] <holycow> ever model has specific ones
[01:23] <lee2> ok

[01:23] <DARKGuy> LjL: Ah, I thought the player was free and the workstation/server version weren't, thus my wonder about it, thanks for claryfing ^_^
[01:23] <zim_> hi all I am trying to run a script /usr/local/bin/backup.sh but need it to run in the background as it will take about 3 hours and I dont want it failing cuz my ADSL drpoped for half a second
[01:23] <nothlit> lol sudoo /etc/init.d/?dm restart isn't good for people with multiple display managers
[01:24] <anandanbu> hi can i use amarok in Ubuntu dapper drake
[01:24] <shwag> so I installed a kernel image and now I regret it. How do I put grub back to the old kernel ?
[01:24] <LjL> DARKGuy: it's free as in gratis, but it's as proprietary as it can get
[01:24] <DARKGuy> LjL: Hehe, got it ;)
[01:24] <zim_> ho do I run that command in the background so I can log out
[01:24] <nolimitsoya> is there any type of crossfeed plugin or option for amarok?
[01:24] <LjL> DARKGuy: and the server is as free as the player (Workstation isn't, no), it's just that only the player is packaged in our repos
[01:24] <zim_> how (sorry)
[01:24] <Svoloch> anandanbu: yes
[01:25] <anuragJ> shwag, whch kernel version do you use ?
[01:25] <lee2> http://www.agci.co.uk/customer/products/1798
[01:25] <DARKGuy> LjL: Ah yes, I noticed it there doing an apt-cache search some days ago :)
[01:25] <triggerhappy5150> total noob here, any recommendations on where ishould go first ot read up on basics?

[01:25] <soundray> shwag: reboot and select the older kernel to boot. Then remove the new kernel with 'sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-kernel-(version of the new one)'. The grub entry will be removed automagically

[01:43] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[01:43] <dm> carzzz215 sorry was afk, built in bluetooth, my BT mouse works just fine but it wont connect to my cell phone
[01:43] <soundray> lee2: please try 'sudo -K' (capital K)
[01:43] <crimsun> dl_jf: redetecting what? (I have not read scrollback.)
[01:43] <lee2> soundray, same
[01:43] <soundray> lee2: on the command itself?
[01:43] <dl_jf> crimsun: my network hardware
[01:43] <ibob63> dsnyders: select the repostiries you want. I always select most of them including the restricted one.
[01:43] <lee2> sudo: timestamp too far in the future: Dec  9 23:51:51 2006
[01:44] <nothlit> lee2, i said, boot into single user mode and use sudo -K
[01:44] <crimsun> dl_jf: it doesn't show up in the device listing (lspnp, lspci, lsusb, depending on the bus) or in dmesg?
[01:44] <lee2> how do i boot into single user mode
[01:44] <carzzz215> dm, oh i see.  I haven't tried a bluetooth mouse. I just trying to send files from my phone to laptop and vice versa.  I installed "bluetooth file sharing 0.8.0 but it doesn't seem to do anything
[01:44] <dl_jf> soo ... if Ubuntu doesnt detect your network hardware, waddya do?
[01:45] <dl_jf> install Arch Linux?
[01:45] <carzzz215> dm, how did you get your laptop to notice your mouse?
[01:45] <crimsun> I'm still awaiting an answer.
[01:45] <soundray> dl_jf: you could. Chances are it won't work there either
[01:45] <lee2> soundray: yea
[01:45] <osubucks> soundray> i'll be back in a few then
[01:45] <lee2> lee@lee-desktop:~$ sudo -K

[01:46] <germann> is mkinitrd broken in hoary?  or am I doing something completely stupid...
[01:46] <soundray> lee2: reboot and select Recovery mode from the grub menu. Run sudo -K from there
[01:46] <germann> it runs, makes a file system in /tmp, but never creates the initrd image  o_O
[01:46] <lee2> soundray, problem is im trying to edit my config file for my monitor display.
[01:46] <triggerhappy5150> god it sucks being a noob to lunux
[01:47] <lee2> otherwise it just says out of range, during boot
[01:47] <lee2> will recovery boot into compatible resolution ?
[01:47] <soundray> lee2: you could do that in recovery mode, too, or leave it for the next normal boot when your sudo will work again.
[01:47] <ibob63> anyone know an easy way to invite someone to a remote desktop session?
[01:47] <lee2> so just reboot ?
[01:47] <soundray> lee2: no, recovery is textmode
[01:47] <triggerhappy5150> i don't even understand half the terminology you guys are using
[01:47] <Amorgin> 'sera.
[01:47] <lemao> What is the default kernel in Ubuntu Dapper?
[01:47] <holycow> triggerhappy5150, it doesn't last long.  the problem typically is  that its harder for windows users to learn linux than for complete computer illiterate users
[01:47] <lee2> so im screwed ?

[01:48] <dl_jf> crimsun: lscpi shows 'Broadcom unknown device' which is probably it
[01:48] <soundray> lee2: no, listen!
[01:48] <TGPO> triggerhappy5150, it will make sense eventually
[01:48] <holycow> triggerhappy5150, that also lasts only for a little while :) welcome btw
[01:48] <lee2> soundray: ok
[01:48] <carzzz215> triggerhappy5150, hey, i'm in the same position.  BUt its fun to learn
[01:48] <dl_jf> crimsun / soundray - actually it does show in lspci
[01:49] <triggerhappy5150> it does seem fun, that's why i'm doing it
[01:49] <dl_jf> as Broacom NetXtreme II
[01:49] <nothlit> lee2, you boot into single user mode by restarting and choosing it from the boot menu, you may have to press esc in order for the menu to reveal itself

[01:49] <lee2> ok

[01:51] <dl_jf> for good OSS supported mini-PCI NICs ?
[01:51] <soundray> dl_jf: sometimes it helps to search the for the PCI identifier string
[01:51] <dl_jf> search where?
[01:51] <triggerhappy5150> xzela: which forums?
[01:51] <Catshrimp> LjL: thank you also :)
[01:51] <nothlit> Catshrimp, fluxbox / openbox+utils are good :)

[01:51] <Catshrimp> nothlit: fluxbox defintiely.  I haven't seen openbox, so I'll check that out as well :)
[01:52] <osubucks> soundray> no go, i can't boot up far enough to do anything
[01:52] <nothlit> lemao, aptitude search linux*386
[01:52] <knix_> nothanks, that php doesnt help me, need more help
[01:52] <dl_jf> soundray: good idea! : https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/73647
[01:52] <dl_jf> its  a reported bug w/ ubuntu
[01:52] <xzela> triggerhappy5150: any of them, though http://ubuntuforums.org/ works pretty well
[01:52] <osubucks> soundray> it boots up... shows splash screen then goes to a black screen and doesn't do anything more
[01:52] <nothlit> Catshrimp, it doesn't come with a toolbaror anything, just a plain window manager, you have to put it together
[01:52] <nothlit> Catshrimp, also,the obconf is broken until you make a few links to some lib.so 's
[01:53] <soundray> dl_jf: oh, I wonder whether that's good or bad news for you.
[01:53] <triggerhappy5150> xzela: thanks
[01:53] <Catshrimp> nothlit: gotcha :)
[01:53] <ryanakca> I keep on getting segfaults with apt-*, aptitude, adept, synaptic, etc. What should I do?
[01:53] <jerp> Could someone inform me, does  mplayer have a slick and easy install, or is it painstaking with file editing?
[01:53] <ryanakca> I have a backtrace if wanted
[01:53] <soundray> osubucks: too bad you've got such a rotten problem when you've just switched.
[01:53] <soundray> osubucks: you might try out some bootoptions:
[01:53] <osubucks> yep, i've had it a few times
[01:53] <xzela> jerp: sudo apt-get install mplayer
[01:54] <soundray> !bootoptions | osubucks
[01:54] <ubotu> osubucks: For a list and explanation on some of the boot options, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
[01:54] <xzela> that might work
[01:54] <nothlit> Catshrimp, supports dockapps, also fbpanel is nice, and pypanel if you want to manually install some python dependencies and pypanel with the install script... its sorta broken from the repos
[01:54] <jerp> xzela, yes, I did that with some plugins too
[01:55] <soundray> osubucks: to apply those boot options, you have to edit the kernel line in the grub entry at boot time:
[01:55] <triggerhappy5150> quick question: what's the shortcut for a command prompt?
[01:55] <holycow> alt / f2
[01:55] <osubucks> soundray> it happened right after i tried to install nvidia drivers
[01:55] <soundray> osubucks: get the grub menu with Esc as the message appears (unless it shows spontaneously)
[01:55] <triggerhappy5150> holycow: thanks
[01:55] <jrib> triggerhappy5150: set what you want in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
[01:55] <nothlit> ryanakca, try restarting first, other wise... reinstall the apt utilities/backends like dselect from a livecd?
[01:55] <dl_jf> soundray: so according to that thread i need to use bnx2. I did $ modprobe bnx2  ( silently succceded ) .... any idea what to do now ?
[01:56] <soundray> osubucks: okay, this procedure still applies...
[01:56] <lee2> ok its working
[01:56] <osubucks> ok.... so what do i do exactly
[01:56] <triggerhappy5150> jrib: thanks more
[01:56] <soundray> osubucks: hit 'e' to edit, go to the kernel line, hit 'e' again and remove 'quiet splash' from the end. You will get a more verbose bootup.
[01:57] <jerp> xzela, I've just not grasped the help file/commandline stuff yet, the gui version at present doesn't see my dvdrom
[01:57] <xzela> jerp: You can also try searching in Synaptic for gstreamer for different codecs
[01:57] <soundray> dl_jf: if you're in gnome, see if your network interface appears now in 'System-Preferences-Networking'
[01:57] <jerp> did that too :)
[01:57] <osubucks> so i put in the cd, and press e to edit then remove that?
[01:57] <felixjet> i cant configure my tv card :( its a hauppage win tv and i know it works in linux, but i cant get it working... i have the mod installed. can someone give me guides or help please?
[01:58] <soundray> osubucks: no, you've installed to the hard disk, haven't you?
[01:58] <dodge> why I get this  error "error executing gpgv" updating from a ubuntu server as root?
[01:58] <osubucks> yes
[01:58] <xzela> jerp: So the system doesn't see your dvdrom drive? Such as you can't play DVDs/CDs from it?
[01:58] <dsnyders> ibob63, I've got everything checked, but I still cannot find fslint.  Either it is not in an edgy repository, or my Synaptic is not configured fully.
[01:58] <cavediver> Can someone recoment a wlan-client-usb-stick that works in Ububtu, without ndiswrapper and other strange things. Something that has support in the kernel and supports WPA2 etc...
[01:58] <soundray> osubucks: boot from the hard disk and follow the procedure above.
[01:58] <MarcN> felixjet: google for mythtv and ubuntu -- you'll need to compile some kernel modules for the haupagge
[01:58] <osubucks> what do i boot up with dude? recovery mode?
[01:59] <jerp> xzela, I can transfer and burn a cd, just not see the dvd
[01:59] <MarcN> felixjet: it has been a while since I setup my mythtv (based on dapper)
[01:59] <soundray> osubucks: no, your normal default grub entry, but edited
[01:59] <jerp> I copied a file this afternoon from a game cd
[01:59] <xzela> jerp: So you have two drives on your machine, one is a CD and the other is a DVD. Is that a true statement?
[01:59] <felixjet> MarcN: i did that guides, the one enabling some mods into the kernel, but still dont works
[02:00] <jerp> xzela, just one, it's one of those combos
[02:00] <xzela> jerp: Awe, now i understand
[02:00] <soundray> cavediver: unfortunately, it's impossible to tell what chipset is in the box. My recommendation: buy from a shop that'll give you an exchange if it doesn't work. Try until you find one that works out of the box.
[02:00] <osubucks> maybe i should just use windows, im not very good at following directions to do something, i usually just figure things out by trial and error..
[02:00] <kurbacik> what patches are needed for the vanilla 2.6.18 kernel to work in ubuntu?
[02:00] <MarcN> felixjet: the howto for mythtv on dapper was pretty good.  I think to test, you did something like mplayer /dev/video0 I'll look for the url
[02:00] <xzela> jerp: So your problem is that you are unable to access data from a DVD via your CD/DVD combo drive. Is that a true statement?
[02:00] <cavediver> soundray: well ok.
[02:01] <soundray> osubucks: you tell me that now, I could have saved some keystrokes.
[02:01] <soundray> cavediver: rule of thumb: the cheaper, the better.
[02:01] <cavediver> :P
[02:01] <soundray> for support in Linux.
[02:01] <osubucks> heh ohw ell, i don't have time to mess around with junk, thanks anyway ;)
[02:01] <cavediver> I need wpa2 support also
[02:01] <felixjet> MarcN: thanks
[02:01] <soundray> osubucks: that's just rude
[02:02] <osubucks> indeed
[02:02] <jerp> xzela, I would say that is a true statement, I've also tried the other proggies like totem and xine under the sound and video in the main menu
[02:02] <MarcN> felixjet: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=186747 and http://hyams.webhop.net/mythtv/myth_ubuntu.html
[02:02] <jerp> with no such luck
[02:02] <osubucks> but its the truth, i have run into more problems trying to get things configured on linux than anything else
[02:02] <dl_jf> soundray: i dont have X
[02:02] <dl_jf> soundray: hey i think its working ...
[02:02] <corevette> i need help, i can't logon to ubuntu regular due to an error in the xserver, so i'm stuck using the recover mode
[02:03] <osubucks> its so much needless configuration, if its for people migrating from windows it should be the similar point and click way of doing it, normal users aren't going to figure this stuff out
[02:03] <osubucks> just my opinion
[02:03] <xzela> jerp: Try this as a test, insert a DVD into your machine, if the dvd does not show up on your desktop, then search in google for this: Ubuntu DVD drive not detected
[02:03] <dl_jf> well not working but its now just editing /etc/networking/interfaces if im right
[02:03] <osubucks> good day :)
[02:03] <soundray> osubucks: look, you're asking for the wrong thing from a Free operating system
[02:03] <lee2> google doesnt know my horizontal sync for my vusys 17inch monitor :(
[02:03] <soundray> osubucks: (free as in speech)
[02:03] <osubucks> thats a good excuse to make for it, rather than fixing the problems
[02:03] <felixjet> MarcN: well at least i can take an idea :) thx again
[02:04] <Catshrimp> Would Xgl get rid of some of the scissor effects when moving windows about the desktop?
[02:04] <soundray> osubucks: most people don't have problems. I volunteer to troubleshoot those that do.
[02:04] <jerp> xzela, I've got Mission Impossible:3 in there right now with nothing dvd wise on the desktop
[02:04] <osubucks> lol, that don't have problems? are you kidding?
[02:04] <jerp> so I guess I'll check the web ;)
[02:04] <osubucks> is that why there are 900 names in here?
[02:05] <MarcN> felixjet: it was straight forward on Dapper, not bothered to upgrade my mythtv box to Edgy and mythtv 0.20 (still on 0.19) and is good enough
[02:05] <holycow> osubucks, he's not kidding
[02:05] <Lixun> Is this the right room for feisty?
[02:05] <jrib> Lixun: #ubuntu+1
[02:05] <holycow> we are converting our company to ubuntu, every time we remove windows and install ubuntu our call levels go to 0

[02:05] <osubucks> funny, i talk to people everyday who can't get this or that working correctly.... i must live in a fantasy world without fanboys

[02:06] <holycow> at least 50% of the problems in here are due to people not making sure their hardware is compatable

[02:13] <yasha> mplayer isn't building with the ablity to resize video, and I can't find the gl2 dev libs to build it into mplayer, anyone know why? Or what to do?
[02:13] <BRat_boy> no, thats my error msg, sudo: can't stat /etc/sudeors : no such file or directory
[02:13] <dl_jf> soundray, I'm working now! thanks for the tips.
[02:13] <carlo> Well, I just updated from jre 1.4 to 1.5... and it works for apps like frostwire.. but firefox still sees v1.4
[02:13] <carlo> any tips?
[02:13] <osubucks> soundray> yes sorry for that rant, im just frustrated is all... im not very good at following instructions for this kind of stuff as i said, so no hard feelings
[02:14] <rconan> soundray: btw i got ubuntu to boot by putting the boot partition first on the drive but now windows doesnt work
[02:14] <jrib> BRat_boy: you made a typo
[02:14] <soundray> lee2: I suggest you do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'. Accept all the defaults, except for the monitor section, where you select Simple and tell it that you can do 1280x1024 at 75 Hz
[02:14] <soothsay> Was there a set of major updates pushed out today or yesterday, requiring a dist-upgrade?
[02:14] <lee2> soundray: timing: 1280x1024@75 (VESA)
[02:14] <lee2>  && ctiming: 1280x960@60
[02:14] <lee2>  && ctiming: 1280x960@75
[02:14] <lee2> 
[02:14] <hou5ton> I have installed smb4k, and when trying to access the folders on a shared network drive, I get the following error: " smbmnt must be installed suid root for direct user mounts. (1000,1000)"   .... can someone tell me what I do now?  :-)
[02:14] <BRat_boy> the error msg is correct, i made the typo
[02:15] <carlo> How can I get firefox to recognize the new version of Java I installed? It's still seeing the previous version
[02:15] <soundray> rconan: I'm glad to hear that.
[02:15] <BRat_boy> i'm simply trying to let the slave be accessbile to everyone, and not root
[02:15] <DARKGuy> Uhhh..
[02:15] <soundray> rconan: of course you won't need Windows now that you've got Ubuntu running ;)
[02:15] <DARKGuy> there's an update for xorg and such... do I install 'em?
[02:15] <rconan> soundray: definitely not
[02:15] <soothsay> carlo: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[02:16] <rconan> i only use windows to play the odd game and this machine isnt good enough for that anyway
[02:16] <jrib> BRat_boy: wait why are you touching /etc/sudoers though?
[02:16] <BRat_boy> because when i type in any sudo command, thats my error msg, and nothing works
[02:16] <soundray> rconan: I guess you could get it back in shape by putting it on a primary partition before your extended and before the dreaded BIOS boundary.
[02:16] <compengi> who are here forum moderators?
[02:16] <carlo> soothsay, I did that and I see the "*" by the correct v1.5
[02:16] <soundray> compengi: there are a few of them, why?
[02:17] <rconan> soundray: the sum of the sizes of the windows partition and the boot partition is more than the bios boundary
[02:17] <jrib> BRat_boy: does /etc/sudoers exist?  What does  'file /etc/sudoers' say?
[02:17] <rconan> id have to shrink it
[02:17] <BRat_boy> file not found
[02:17] <jrib> BRat_boy: erm that's a problem :/
[02:17] <rconan> id sooner spend my time just using the computer with linux than try to make windows work
[02:17] <soundray> rconan: annoying... no spare hard disk drive in sight?
[02:17] <BRat_boy> agreed.
[02:17] <rconan> only a SATA one which is definitely not useful
[02:17] <BRat_boy> in this case, once this problem is fixed, i can finally format hte last windows machine
[02:18] <jrib> BRat_boy: has sudo ever worked?
[02:18] <compengi> soundray, cause yesterday i made a post it said that it won't be in the forums before a moderator checks it
[02:18] <BRat_boy> nope
[02:18] <BRat_boy> fresh install
[02:18] <jrib> BRat_boy: did you have any problems with the install?
[02:18] <BRat_boy> no sir
[02:18] <compengi> soundray, and it's not in the forums till now
[02:18] <rconan> soundray: with any luck i wont have to use this machine for long anyway
[02:18] <soundray> compengi: I see, you mean ubuntuforums. Sorry, I guess you have to be patient still
[02:18] <yasha> anyone built mplayer in here?
[02:19] <jrib> BRat_boy: can you su to root?
[02:19] <rconan> im waiting on my good motherboard back from ASUS
[02:19] <BRat_boy> yes
[02:19] <jrib> !anyone | yasha
[02:19] <ubotu> yasha: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:19] <jrib> BRat_boy: how did you set that up?
[02:19] <owh> soothsay: I just received an update for 25 packages including X.org if that helps.
[02:19] <soundray> rconan: oh, I wish you that required bit of any luck, then :)
[02:19] <BRat_boy> su <enter> password <typed pass>
[02:19] <compengi> soundray, is any of the moderators online now?
[02:19] <jrib> BRat_boy: so this isn't a normal desktop install?
[02:19] <soothsay> owh: Yeah thanks. Are you being asked to do a dist-upgrade?
[02:19] <soundray> compengi: I don't know. Sorry, I thought you meant channel moderators.
=== bokey_out is now known as bokey
[02:20] <yasha> !because | it'd be nice to get someone onto the topic that I'm going to ask first
[02:20] <rconan> my only question now is how i remove the defoptions from /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about because - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:20] <rconan> when i delete it it comes back
[02:20] <BRat_boy> really, if i could figure out how to change file permissions on the slave , i'd be good to go
[02:20] <soundray> rconan: add a second # to the beginning of the defoptions line and run 'sudo update-grub'
[02:20] <BRat_boy> i can see it but have no access outside of root
[02:20] <rconan> soundray: that makes it come back
[02:20] <knix_> owh,
[02:20] <rconan> it removed the second #
[02:21] <owh> soothsay: No, but then I'm a little cautious :-)
[02:21] <owh> knix_: Hiya.
[02:21] <knix_> kewl
[02:21] <knix_> owh, i had a perfectly good lamp server running until about an hour ago.  Now php want to download the php file rather than displaying it.   I have tried everything to reinstalling php5, apache2, and libapache2-mod-php5.  Please guys, i am very desperate here
[02:21] <owh> knix_: What broke it?
[02:21] <lee2> soundray: done
[02:21] <soundray> rconan: oh, I haven't heard of that behaviour. In that case, just change it to 'defoptions=', leaving the rest of the line empty.
[02:21] <lee2> soundray: how do i restart xserver ?
[02:21] <soundray> lee2: 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'
[02:21] <yasha> mplayer won't resize video, and I can't find the gl/gl2 dev libs to build those into the driver base
[02:21] <owh> lee2: Ctrl - Alt - Backspace
[02:22] <rconan> soundray: for some reason whatever i do to it update-grub replaces it with the default line
[02:22] <yasha> the packaged version of mplayer works fine, and the version I've built works, just can't resize video
[02:22] <knix_> owh, i dont know, i just want to get it back to normal
[02:22] <BRat_boy> tried to run diskmounter, but can't load it due to my sudo issue
[02:23] <owh> knix_: I see in ##php you're talking about having done something with dbx.
[02:23] <soundray> rconan: do you have the unwanted options in the kopt line as well?
[02:23] <knix_> owh, correct
[02:23] <rconan> soundray: no
[02:23] <jerp> xzela, are you still here?
[02:23] <soundray> rconan: also, edit /etc/default/rcS and change VERBOSE to yes
[02:23] <owh> knix_: So, it was working, then what did you do, *exactly*.
[02:23] <carlo> so I found the file libjavaplugin_oji.so in  ~/jre-1.5.0_09/debian/jre/usr/java/jre1.5.0_09/plugin/i386/ns7 and copied it to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugin
[02:24] <carlo> but "about:plugins" still shows v1.4!!! ANy help out there?!
[02:24] <knix_> owh, i dont know exactly.  I was trying to get dbx working with php
[02:24] <soundray> carlo: restart firefox
[02:24] <fbc> I trade my BCM4318 for a BSM4306.. Can someone help me get it working??
[02:24] <knix_> but, i reinstalled apache2, and php5 a dozen times now, and still the same thing
[02:24] <rconan> soundray: it still leaves the defoptions line there
[02:24] <bariel> hello, if i want to set up only a webserver and no other service, do you guys see any necessity using a firewall?
[02:24] <rconan> and removes the extra #
[02:25] <jsoftw> So noobs, whats the command to install php with an already installed apache2.
[02:25] <knix_> apt-get
[02:25] <econobeing> i got a re-sizeing problem with beryl...i can't
[02:25] <rconan> bariel: yes, to block all the non-webserver ports
[02:25] <LjL> jsoftw: how could i know, being such a noob?
[02:25] <jsoftw> apt-get what.
[02:25] <cappicrd> private
[02:25] <knix_> its apt-get install php5
[02:25] <owh> knix_: But you likely didn't purge the configuration files. So had you changed any settings in apache or php?
[02:25] <jsoftw> knix_: well does that work then?
[02:25] <soundray> rconan: sorry, I have no explanation for that.
[02:25] <administrator_> ok thanks guys
[02:25] <lufis> How do I keep the "Launching HTTP cache cleaner" message from appearing in Gnome when using KDE apps?
[02:25] <knix_> i did purge
[02:25] <fbc> econobeing:  I hear there are pills for that problem. :-p
[02:26] <rconan> soundray: tis annoying
[02:26] <knix_> jsoftw, no it does not
[02:26] <jsoftw> knix_: what does it do? Cmon, details
[02:26] <knix_> i need to get red sox
[02:26] <jsoftw> Yeah well, apt-get red-socks later on.
[02:26] <fbc> I traded my BCM4318 for a BSM4306.. Can someone help me get it working??
[02:26] <owh> Hmm, it's pretty noisy in here, jsoftw and knix_ head to #itmaze, we'll see if we can sort this out.
[02:26] <jsoftw> For now, give info about what is wrong with php5 install.......
[02:26] <solar_> hi all
[02:26] <knix_> kk
[02:26] <jsoftw> Meh
[02:26] <jsoftw> Im chasing you two around the interweb
[02:26] <lee2> it didnt work, maybe its the gpu ?
[02:27] <soundray> And I have to go... rconan, hope you get it working. Do ask the channel again, if you're lucky, you'll find a proper grub expert.
[02:27] <Zelda> hey everyone.
[02:27] <solar_> i've got a problem getting a 600dpi scanner to work with ubuntu
[02:27] <owh> jsoftw: Sorry 'bout that :-)
[02:27] <lee2> and when i boot, it still says "Not in range"
[02:27] <solar_> any can help me out/
[02:27] <lee2> if i drag a window which is big, thats when it 'jitters'
[02:27] <dsnyders> Hmm... fslint only seems to be in the feisty repositories.  Mixing repository versions is *BAD*, right?
[02:28] <fbc> I traded my BCM4318 for a BCM4306.. Can someone help me get it working??
[02:28] <damageDOn1> Hello I'm getting a permission denied error when I'm trying to copy a firefox profile from one machine to another. Does anyone know why that would happen or if there is a way around it?
[02:28] <solar_> the scanner is a GENX
[02:28] <solar_> it is actually a plustek flatbed scanner
[02:28] <Zelda> Im trying to install ubuntu,mandriva, and windowsXP on a 160gb HDD. I want to have 80GB where all the OS's can read/write to. Can this be done, and can someone help me install it?
[02:28] <lee2> how can i check the drivers for my Video card are correctly installed ?
[02:28] <josh_> i am having some problems removing a package from my box... i have tried apt-get remove samba but it takes errors, i have tried dpkg -r purge samba but it takes errors... what other ways can i get these files off my system?
[02:29] <josh_> Zelda, windows first, then either linux distro
[02:29] <solar_> i tried installing sane 1.0.18 in /usr/local by compiling
[02:30] <damageDOn1> Hello I'm getting a permission denied error when I'm trying to copy a firefox profile from one machine to another. Does anyone know why that would happen or if there is a way around it?
[02:30] <rconan> anyone know why update-grub keeps adding the #defoptions line to my menu.lst
[02:30] <rconan> ?
[02:30] <josh_> partition your drives for 10 gigs each which would leave you with 110~ gigs for file sharing between the os's
[02:31] <carlo> I tried the restart and STILL only see jre1.4!!
[02:31] <lee2> which one does ubuntu have, xorg or xfree ?
[02:31] <josh_> you will need to make sure that you dont format in ntfs though
[02:31] <dsnyders> damageDOn1, Check the source and destination folder permissions.
[02:31] <LjL> lee2: xorg
[02:31] <lee2> in ubuntu, how do i open a RPM file
[02:31] <josh_> with alien
[02:31] <dl_jf> alien
[02:32] <hou5ton> I have installed smb4k, and when trying to access the folders on a shared network drive, I get the following error: " smbmnt must be installed suid root for direct user mounts. (1000,1000)"   .... can someone tell me what I do now?  :-)
[02:32] <lee2> i got drivers from ati website, but they have arrived in RPM format
[02:32] <LjL> !rpm | lee2
[02:32] <ubotu> lee2: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[02:32] <LjL> Ubotu, tell lee2 about ati | lee2, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:32] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: I am using sudo scp on the destination machine and I've tried changing the permissions with chown and chgrp on the source
[02:33] <solar_> anybody who can help me with my scanner
[02:33] <Zelda> josh: with what distro?
[02:33] <Zelda> windows xp is ntfs
[02:33] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: I know once I have the files copied across I need to change the permissions but I shouldn't be getting permission denied on the copying should I?
[02:33] <nothlit> !info smbfs | hou5ton
[02:33] <ubotu> smbfs: mount and umount commands for the smbfs (for kernels >= than 2.2.x). In component main, is optional. Version 3.0.22-1ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 375 kB, installed size 900 kB
[02:33] <josh_> yes, but windows doesn't like other os's getting to it so ntfs is proprietary
[02:33] <ThePub> anyone have a suggestion on how to get overlay to work on both sides of a big desktop using fglrx
[02:34] <nothlit> !info smb4k
[02:34] <ubotu> smb4k: A Samba (SMB) share advanced browser for KDE. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.7.1-1 (edgy), package size 1176 kB, installed size 2984 kB
[02:34] <lee2> ok i need to install the fglrx ati driver
[02:34] <damageDOn1> nothlit: thanks for your help with scp yesterday.
[02:34] <josh_> so your windows partition will be 10 gig ntfs, the others can use whatever you choose
[02:34] <dsnyders> damageDOn1, you will be getting those errors if the user you are logging in as does not have write permissions to the destination folder.
[02:34] <nothlit> hou5ton, the problem is that you need root privileges or setting the suid bit
[02:34] <lee2> how do i install the flgrx driver ? it just says i need to install it if i have x1600
[02:34] <josh_> and then to share between the windows and linux distros just make a fat 32 partition
[02:35] <nothlit> damageDOn1, oh what happened, where did everything get transferred? inside the folder or directly to the home folder?
[02:35] <josh_> its not very... efficient though...
[02:35] <Zelda> what would be the best?
[02:35] <hou5ton> nothlit:   ok ... I'm not sure I understand what you are saying, but how can I fix it, please?
[02:35] <solar_> can anybody suggest where to check for configuring scanners
[02:35] <Zelda> 20gb for each linux distro, and then 120 for windows?
[02:36] <nothlit> hou5ton, both ways involve using unsafe methods, i recommend you use a different method for browsing samba shares
[02:36] <damageDOn1> nothlit: I had a strange problem where it seemed to copy everything 4 times and I filled my 100Gb drive. but I managed to get back in and delete everything and I moved bits and pieces across and now my machine is all up and running. The scp command worked great cheers
[02:36] <josh_> there are applications to use for linux to access and write to ntfs, but its not recommended
[02:36] <hou5ton> nothlit:   actually, regarding safety ... this is in my own home and all other occupants are trusted.  :-)
[02:36] <Zelda> so linux is fat32?
[02:36] <nicola> Guys I've got a problem: http://pastebin.ca/271007
[02:37] <nicola> my sources.list is clean
[02:37] <josh_> if you plan on only sharing little files between them make the fat32 part smaller
[02:37] <miranda> do anyone knows how to install yahoo messanger on ubuntu linux
[02:37] <Zelda> what if its going to be music?
[02:37] <carlo> miranda, you cant- go with GAIM
[02:37] <hou5ton> miranda:   you can use Gaim, you know
[02:37] <josh_> Zelda: linux is ext2/3, reiser, etc.
[02:37] <solar_> zelda linux is using its own ext2/ext3 filesystem second one has journalling support
[02:37] <josh_> then just make it 10 gig
[02:37] <phpError> How do you make it so a user can't get of there home directory in Efty Edge?
[02:37] <miranda> Gaim? what is it?
[02:38] <Zelda> well youre speaking to someone who knows nothing about linux.
[02:38] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: I'm logging into the destination as the first user in ubuntu (which has all privileges) and I'm attempting to copy the firefox default profile from an old machine.
[02:38] <carlo> GAIM is a multiplatform messenger
[02:38] <solar_> zelda i can understand it/
[02:38] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: I managed to copy all the evolution files with no problem
[02:38] <josh_> zelda, fat32 is universally supported by both linux and windows. now extra software would be needed
[02:38] <miranda> okay,  where can that be found?
[02:39] <carlo> miranda, it will let you use YAhoo, MSN, and AOL all at once
[02:39] <Zelda> josh: like what?
[02:39] <Anarch> !bc
[02:39] <carlo> should already b installed. If not, check synaptic
[02:39] <ubotu> bc: The GNU bc arbitrary precision calculator language. In component main, is optional. Version 1.06-19ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 64 kB, installed size 188 kB
[02:39] <josh_> but fat32 has a less efficient way of storing data
[02:39] <solar_> any scanner expert round there pls//
[02:39] <josh_> s/now/no
[02:39] <hou5ton> nothlit:   so ... any help on accessing my folders on my home network drivce?
[02:39] <miranda> thanks  i will try that
[02:40] <nothlit> hou5ton, lol I meant unsafe system practices for exploits, rather than the users itself
[02:40] <lee2> yay i did the ati drivers myself :) and it worked
[02:40] <Cubed> yay.......... i ALMOST installed that damn ndiswrapper....... can anyone tell a noob how i can make sure i have my DEPENDENCIES  in order?
[02:40] <nothlit> hou5ton, you could do your filebrowsing with kdesu konqueror
[02:40] <lee2> um how do get the backup config file for my xserver ?
[02:40] <lee2> now that ive found out it wasnt a monitor issue
[02:41] <hou5ton> nothlit:   I don't think I even have konqueror installed ... using Gnome
[02:41] <_goofy_> im trying to stream movies over the internet from my computer any thought on how i should do this
[02:41] <nicola> Guys I've got a problem: http://pastebin.ca/271007 , my sources is http://pastebin.ca/271107
[02:41] <carlo> goofy, look into splitcam
[02:41] <hou5ton> nothlit:   ya ... it's there
[02:41] <MarcN> solar_: what is your scanner problem?  Not all (most?) scanners are supported by SANE.
[02:41] <hou5ton> nothlit:   so, ... do I really need smb4k at all?
[02:41] <carlo> I don't know if it runs on *nix, but you can try it with wine
[02:41] <dsnyders> damageDOn1, try reversing your connection.  Log into the destination machine and do the scp the other way.
[02:41] <bariel> hello, if i want to set up only a webserver and no other service, do you guys see any necessity using a firewall?
[02:41] <nothlit> !info smb4k
[02:41] <ubotu> smb4k: A Samba (SMB) share advanced browser for KDE. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.7.1-1 (edgy), package size 1176 kB, installed size 2984 kB
[02:42] <nothlit> !info smb4k | hou5ton
[02:42] <josh_> zelda, install windows on a size part you want, same with the other 2 linux distros after that... if your only moving files back and forth (music, text, smaller movies, etc.) just make a 10 gig fat32 partition... then no need for any additional software. both windows and linux will recognize the files on a fat 32 partition
[02:42] <Zelda> josh: if Im just starting out learning linux, Do I need to do that? Or is that something that isnt worth it?
[02:42] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: I am logged into the destination machine... Sorry I must have said the wrong thing before.
[02:42] <nothlit> hou5ton, you know smb4k is for kde rofl?
[02:42] <MarcN> bariel: make sure that only ports 80, 443 and 22 are allowed in.
[02:42] <jerp> can someone explain how to fix this one...... it's audio froma dvd+rw in mplayer ' Requested audio codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not available.  Enable it at compilation. '
[02:42] <nothlit> !mp3 | jerp
[02:42] <ubotu> jerp: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[02:42] <hou5ton> nothlit:   yes ... but I actually had it work before on a previous system similar to this one, and that ran on Gnome
[02:43] <nothlit> hou5ton, use nautilus, it has a samba browser
[02:43] <nothlit> hou5ton, or gksudo smb4k
[02:43] <josh_> Zelda: probably not worth it. till you get good with linux command line i would suggest ubuntu and windows os's only (once you get good on the commandline you will find alot of similiarities between linux distros.
[02:43] <Cubed> yay.......... i ALMOST installed that damn ndiswrapper....... can anyone tell a noob how i can make sure i have my DEPENDENCIES  in order?
[02:43] <lee2> how do i rename a file in console ?
[02:43] <solar_> MarcN: My scanner is a GENX 600dpi scanner , when I run scanimage -L
[02:43] <Catshrimp> When installed from the respos, does the mysql server store its data under var?
[02:43] <blameless> Cubed: what dependencies?
[02:43] <bariel> MarcN, i will close anything besides 80/443, is it safe for me without firewall?
[02:44] <Cubed> hell if i know
[02:44] <Cubed> that what it tells me when i try to install the deb
[02:44] <josh_> if you only plan on reading files back and forth (playing music and such), windows has an application called ext2ifs that will read all your linux files. and if you just mount the ntfs partition as read only you can get those files on your linux
[02:44] <dsnyders> damageDOn1, No, it was probably me misinterpreting what you said.
[02:44] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: hang on.... could it be that I need to put the use name of the user I'm copying the file from before the @ in the command? IOW if I'm copying a file from user 2 it should be scp -r user2@oldmachIP .....
[02:44] <Cubed> for ndiswrapper
[02:44] <solar_> it lists as plustek 1200dpi scanner, and neither Kooka or xsane detects it,, and thank you for asking me
[02:44] <josh_> but writing back and forth between the 2 partitions isn't recommended
[02:44] <lee2> how do i rename files in a console ?
[02:44] <lee2> REN ?
[02:44] <Cubed> i wen in terminal
[02:44] <crimsun> mv
[02:44] <blameless> Cubed: are you installing it from apt?
[02:44] <blameless> Cubed: apt should install the dependencies for you
[02:44] <thor> lee2: mv - you move the file to a new name
[02:44] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: I was putting user1@oldmachIP
[02:45] <bariel> MarcN, you stil there?
[02:45] <Cubed> no i can't, i can't set up my internet so i have no access to online
[02:45] <Cubed> so how do i manually install them?
[02:45] <damageDOn1> dsnyders: nope that didn't work either
[02:45] <Cubed> or if there is an easier way, i would like to know
[02:45] <nothlit> damageDOn1, install gftp and just use that to transfer files
[02:45] <nothlit> damageDOn1, it'll be simpler for you to understand
[02:45] <dsnyders> damageDOn1, yes, exactly.  If user1 does not have read permission to user2's files.
[02:46] <dsnyders> That didn't work?
[02:46] <Zelda> josh: Will Linux read my mp3s that I have in windows or no?
[02:46] <blameless> Cubed: well if you put the other .debs in the same folder as the ndiswrapper, dpkg should install all of the needed files
[02:46] <Zelda> well not windows, the ntfs partition?
[02:46] <dsnyders> damageDOn1, Is firefox in use on the source machine?
[02:46] <josh_> yes
[02:46] <josh_> just mount the partition read only and you wont have any issues
=== bariel is now known as fwtest
[02:46] <Zelda> or should I create a seperate partition for my music files that both os's can read?
[02:47] <Cubed> blameless: how do i know if i have all the debs?
[02:47] <damageDOn1> dsnyders & nothlit: I didn't fully understand the scp command. I get it now...
[02:47] <kelenn> who is using meta-tracker here ?
[02:47] <josh_> not worth it
[02:47] <hou5ton> nothlit:   sorry, but no matter what I try ... including all your suggestions .. I still get the same error
[02:47] <josh_> if you mount your windows read only you can still copy from windows to linux if need be
[02:47] <blameless> Cubed: dpkg should spit out what it is depending on
[02:47] <Cubed> blameless: all i downloaded was a file called ndiswrapper-modules2.6.deb
[02:47] <Zelda> ok, so how do I do that?
[02:47] <nothlit> !ntfs | zelda
[02:47] <ubotu> zelda: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[02:47] <josh_> but u can read right off the windows partition so no need to copy anyway
[02:47] <blameless> Cubed: was that built for ubuntu?
[02:47] <jughead> what file represents the keyboard?  a game I'm playing looks for a joystick at /dev/js0 but I need to change it to whatever the keyboard is
[02:48] <josh_> thats how Zelda
[02:48] <nothlit> !ntfs-3g | Zelda
[02:48] <ubotu> Zelda: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution.

[02:48] <AdamKili> hey i was wondering if you can install ubuntu and windows on the same (FAT32?) partition?
[02:48] <blameless> i went ahead and built the ndiswrapper for source
[02:48] <josh_> thanks nothlit
[02:48] <nothlit> Zelda, if you want to create a fat partition for both linux/windows, its pretty easy
[02:48] <damageDOn1> dsnyders & nothlit: I've got 2 new laptops. One for me and one for my girlfriend. I was trying to move my stuff (user1) and the command I was using was scp -r user1@oldmachIP.
[02:48] <Cubed> blameless: i'm not sure, i thought all debs relate to debian-based linux systems like ubunt
[02:48] <Zelda> Josh: said it wasnt worth it
[02:48] <mkaster> hello, i need some help in xubuntu
[02:48] <Zelda> whats going to be the easiest to do?
[02:48] <blameless> Cubed: well it has to match the kernel version in ubuntu.  if not, it'll have to be rebuilt
[02:49] <fbc> Are there any ubuntu witch doctors or magicians???
[02:49] <blameless> Cubed: and in that case, you might as well download the tar.gz and build it
[02:49] <josh_> if all your doing is listening to mp3's between both os's... not worth it
[02:49] <damageDOn1> dsnyders & nothlit: I forgot to change the command when I was trying to move her stuff from my old machine to her laptop to reflect that she was a different user (user2) so the command need to change to scp -r user2@....
[02:49] <josh_> if you plan on copying files back and forth its worth it
[02:49] <fbc> I need one for my BCM4306....
[02:49] <Zelda> yeah cause I dont know linux that well yet.
[02:49] <josh_> both are easy procedures
[02:49] <Zelda> I plan on moving over here soon.
[02:49] <Zelda> Im sick of Windows
[02:49] <Cubed> blameless: i'm new to ubuntu, i have ver 6.10 edgy
[02:49] <josh_> lol wait till you get vista... then you will really be sick :P
[02:50] <solar_> Zelda : good good good
[02:50] <Zelda> and Vista looks too much like linux\OSX
[02:50] <damageDOn1> dsnyders & nothlit: I just tried to run it and it didn't work at first because I had been messing with the permission on the old machine and need to put them back.
[02:50] <nothlit> damageDOn1, you also need to change to /home/user2
[02:50] <mkaster> I need help installing my wifi card on my laptop, it is pcmcia, but when i typed lspcmcia it sed there was no such command
[02:50] <damageDOn1> dsnyders & nothlit: I've done it now and it all works
[02:50] <dsnyders> damageDOn1, Wonderful!
[02:50] <AdamKili> hey i was wondering: is it possible to install ubuntu and windows on the same partition?
[02:50] <reddragon3668> speaking of Ubuntu versions... is there an easy way to tell what version one is running? I've tried "uname"... but I just get the kernel version, etc...
[02:50] <Cubed> blameless: i think my kernel ver in usr/src/ is ver 2.6(maybe a 2.6.7.1 or somthing like that)
[02:50] <Zelda> I work for the "Geek Squad"
[02:50] <jrib> !version | reddragon3668
[02:50] <ubotu> reddragon3668: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.

[02:51] <reddragon3668> ubotu: thanks allot!

[02:51] <josh_> subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 102..... what the hell does that mean?
[02:51] <solar_> Zelda : it is not in the looks, the windows err..... the Xwindows of linux is a small part of linux, you can manage linux even without Xwindows
[02:51] <nothlit> AdamKili, no
[02:51] <damageDOn1>  nothlit: Yeah I had changed that part already. It was just the user2 before the @ that I hadn't done.
[02:51] <nothlit> AdamKili, they need different filesystems
[02:51] <nothlit> damageDOn1, ahh i see
[02:51] <fbc> Has anyone heard of a BCM43xx card turning on an off automatically????? My wireless light is going on and off intremittently ever couple of minutes or so. Should I be calling an exorcist???
[02:51] <AdamKili> nothlit: not even if they are both on FAT32? dang...
[02:51] <Cubed> blameless: what kernel version comes with 6.10 edgy ubuntu??????????
[02:51] <Zelda> Well im getting tired of Microsoft developing shit.

[02:54] <lee2> everything is working perfectly, except when i switch to main console, monitor says "out of range"

[02:55] <sp00n3d> rtfm
[02:55] <concept10> Does anyone have knowledge of what has changed in Edgy where drives have to be mounted using UUID?
[02:55] <lemao> should I always use aptitude instead of apt-get in Ubuntu server?
[02:55] <Pelo> cwillu,   look in system > admin >...
[02:55] <lee2> how come during boot, the monitor goes to "out of range" until xserver is started ?
[02:55] <cwillu> Pelo: didn't work
[02:55] <cwillu> I've turned it off in power management, still blanks after 40 minutes or so
[02:56] <cwillu> turned it off in the bios, same deal, gconf-editor, same deal, etc
[02:56] <CyberMad> i forget where to set DNS Server (Nameserver) /etc ??
[02:56] <Zelda> Someone?
[02:56] <sp00n3d> i'm asking one more time....
[02:56] <sp00n3d> I have my CD drive set up as the first thing to boot up but for some reason it will not try to boot from the CD. I've checked bios and I'm sure it's correct. What other Settings can I check?
[02:56] <Pelo> cwillu,  might just be the screensaver
[02:56] <mkaster> ok how do I install a Sandisk connectPlus wifi/compcact flash memory card?
[02:56] <Zelda> Does anyone know about Mandriva?
[02:56] <w3ccv> CyberMad, /etc/resolv.conf   nameserver (IP of nameserver)
[02:56] <Zelda> and the differences between some?
[02:56] <mkaster> mandriva is cool but the ubuntu distros are better
[02:56] <cwillu> screen saver isn't running
[02:56] <Pelo> Zelda,  try  #mandriva
[02:57] <CyberMad> thanks w3ccv
[02:57] <AdamKili> nothlit: I have a Creative Zen Vision: M, and linux just doesn't have the support I need for it (it's an MTP device) so I was hoping I could just use Windows for my music and Ubuntu for everything else. I have a rather small HD (40GB) so splitting it into two different partitions just won't work for me. So there's no way to do it though?
[02:57] <Zelda> heh, thanks.
[02:57] <Zelda> I was just wondering if people here would know.
[02:57] <miranda> anyone knows of azureus?
[02:57] <Pelo> cwillu, something in your bios maybe ?
[02:57] <thespore> I'm getting unkillable processes after playing a game in cedega.  I'm fairly naive to the issue, what causes this?  Bad drivers?
[02:57] <Pelo> miranda,   #azureus-support
[02:57] <thor> mkaster: does the system detect the card when you plug it in?
[02:57] <cwillu> bios has it turned off;  I've been running into this on 4-5 different makes of machines though
[02:58] <Zelda> and I took the mutiple choice linux distro test, and they said that my two top prefered linux distros would be Ubuntu, and Mandriva
[02:58] <miranda> i wanted to installed but i couldn't figure it out
[02:58] <mkaster> How would I know if it detects it?
[02:58] <Zelda> so..
[02:58] <sp00n3d> ok thanks for the help >.<
[02:58] <sp00n3d> L-)
[02:58] <Pelo> cwillu,  search for "sleep" in synaptic and see if you have something install that could account for it
[02:58] <thor> mkaster: you can use the command 'tail -f /var/log/messages' and when you plug in the card you should see some log entries indicating the system has detected the card
[02:58] <nothlit> AdamKili, the zen visiion M is 30 gigs lol
[02:59] <x-r00t-x> can anyone tell me where can i get  precompiled tcl-sql for ubuntu 6.10 edgy
[02:59] <AdamKili> nothlit: ya i usually move my videos off my computer's HDD
[02:59] <nothlit> AdamKili, wait, you aren't trying to install windows/ubuntu on this partition?
[02:59] <LjL> !info mysqltcl | x-r00t-x, perhaps this?
[02:59] <miranda> azureus support will help

[02:59] <sp00n3d> can anyone read me?
[02:59] <lee2> why is everything blank until ubuntu xserver starts ?
[02:59] <cwillu> Pelo: only thing installed that came up for sleep was coreutils
[02:59] <x-r00t-x> tnx LjL
[02:59] <w3ccv> sp00n3d, we can read what you type
[03:00] <ryanakca> nothlit: that stuff for apt that you suggested didn't work... I'm installing the ddebs for apt and apt-utils now..
[03:00] <adeiss> what the daubt about azereus, miranda?
[03:00] <nothlit> AdamKili, the zen v m has a split ums/mtp mode
[03:00] <cwillu> lee2:  sounds like the splash screen isn't working for you
=== sp00n3d is now known as sp0rk3d
[03:00] <Pelo> cwillu,   put coreutils -h in the terminal and see if something is related
[03:00] <AdamKili> nothlit: i would like to be able to have windows and ubuntu on the same partition on my computer.
[03:00] <miranda> I downloade it but i can't install it
[03:00] <lee2> cwillu: i get grub up, select ubuntu generic..."out of range" appears, i hear HD loading, then Ubuntu appears.
[03:00] <sp0rk3d> ok so shouldn't ALL cd drives be bootable nowadays?
[03:01] <x-r00t-x> LjL, can you tell me where is libmysqltcl.so located at ?
[03:01] <nothlit> AdamKili, 40 gigs is managable with both windows and linux
[03:01] <carlo> ANyone able to help me understand WHY I was able to upgrade to JRE1.5 but firefox still sees v1.4?
[03:01] <lee2> its as if, the textmode of linux isnt displaying in a compatible resolution
[03:01] <nothlit> AdamKili, you can resize with gparted
[03:01] <cwillu> lee2:  yep;  edit the grub line and remove 'quiet splash', and you'll get a noisy boot;
[03:01] <AdamKili> nothlit: and no it doesn't, it has a removable disk (UMS) mode, but that's kept separate from the partition that's only accessable by MTP
[03:01] <CyberMad> i tried edit the resolv.conf, but i don't have root access.. i tried "su" in command but i don't know the password, because when installation of ubuntu.. ubuntu not ask me about that, so what i must to do?
[03:01] <unclemike> ? how good does beryl or compiz work with 6.10
[03:01] <nothlit> AdamKili, yeah i know, thats why i called it a split mode
[03:01] <lee2> cwillu, hmmm ok
[03:01] <cwillu> Pelo: coreutils isn't a program, it's all the basic gnu utils
[03:01] <d1gital> cybermad:   sudo passwd root
[03:01] <nothlit> ryanakca, what did i tell you and what do you need help with?
[03:01] <CyberMad> thanks d1gital
[03:01] <LjL> x-r00t-x: i could... or i could tell you how you can find that out by yourself ;-)
[03:02] <LjL> Ubotu, tell x-r00t-x about apt-file | x-r00t-x, see the private message from Ubotu

[03:02] <Pelo> cwillu,   in terminal type  sleep --help
[03:02] <Rebecca_> Sorry to bother you guys, anyone know why I'm unable to use my wireless network with WEP? It works fine with no encryption
[03:02] <cwillu> Pelo... please listen
[03:02] <ryanakca> you said to reboot or reinstall apt
[03:02] <w3ccv> CyberMad, use sudo (whatever editor) /etc/resolv.conf
[03:02] <geek_metal> hi
[03:02] <nothlit> ryanakca,well you need to reinstall the backends to apt along with the front ends
[03:02] <LjL> x-r00t-x: however, i can tell you that i don't see that specific file in any package. there is /usr/lib/mysqltcl-3.02/libmysqltcl3.02.so
[03:02] <jerp> unclemike, I heard it ain't worth a she-ite, they are tryin to iron out some bugs in 0.1.2
[03:02] <mvc> I have a problem. First time I installed ubuntu there was sound. Now, the seconde time, it doesnt detect the chip of sound. What to do?
[03:03] <LjL> x-r00t-x: (and it's in the mysqltcl package)
[03:03] <x-r00t-x> tnx LjL  :)
[03:03] <AdamKili> nothlit: so your saying to shrink my ubuntu partition and install windows in the free space? but windows won't be able to access my music cause it's on the EXT3 partition? (unless there's a way to get it to access it?)
[03:03] <d1gital> unclemike:   i have heard just the opposite, that it works great.  In fact, i am uprading right now
[03:03] <lee2> cwillu, where is grub config file ?
[03:03] <CyberMad> w3ccv yes.. i did.. :) thanks all, it works..
[03:03] <nothlit> AdamKili, EXT2 ifs
[03:03] <cwillu> lee2: /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:03] <d1gital> i must warn yuo though....  6.06 -> 6.10 takes f...o...r...e...v...e...r
[03:04] <Rebecca_> Sorry to bother you guys, anyone know why I'm unable to use my wireless network with WEP? It works fine with no encryption
[03:04] <nothlit> AdamKili, you can put the music on a fat drive, or on ntfs and use ntfs-3g to read it with linux
[03:04] <nothlit> AdamKili, fat partition*
[03:04] <nothlit> AdamKili, there are lots of ways
[03:04] <d1gital> rebecca:  have you tried network-manager?
[03:04] <Rebecca_> d1gital yeah
[03:05] <nothlit> ryanakca, no thats not what i said
[03:05] <hou5ton> nothlit:   hey ... just following up ... found the solution about 3/4 the way down on this page ... http://noiesmo.dnsalias.net/index.php?topic=Networking
[03:05] <unclemike> digital: ok thanks....
[03:05] <mvc> What drivers should I install to have sound? it's ac97 compliant(realtek). Thanks
[03:05] <nothlit> hou5ton, what were you trying to do?
[03:05] <w3ccv> Rebecca_, probably you entered the key as one long 26 characet string, enter it as 1234-5678-9012-3456-abcd-ef

[03:05] <lee2> do i just kill the quiet splash at the end
[03:05] <hou5ton> nothlit:   access a shared network drive
[03:05] <miranda> yes
[03:05] <hou5ton> nothlit:   remember, smb4k and all that

[03:06] <nothlit> hou5ton, congrats:)
[03:06] <lee2> would that boot ?
[03:06] <hou5ton> nothlit:   thanks for you help too
[03:06] <cwillu> lee2: if all you did was remove quiet and splash, it should
[03:06] <miranda> trying to install azureus

[03:07] <miranda> you?
[03:07] <Pelo> miranda,  just use the  add/remove and it should be simple , for config go to the az channel
[03:07] <CyberMad> can you recommend telnet software? it's like putty, securecrt, netterm in windows.. i want better GUI than do telnet in terminal and there is setting option for change user interface colour, etc.
[03:07] <econobeing> i can't get "sudo make install" for ndiswrapper working
[03:07] <econobeing> i KNOW i'm missing something
[03:07] <nothlit> hou5ton, it basically lets regular users run a command with root permissions without any password authentication
[03:07] <lemao> d1gital: but do they use the same underlying apt-get infrastructure?
[03:07] <zoredache> why not butty CyberMad ?

[03:08] <ubotu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[03:08] <carlo> econobeing, what chipset and driver are you using?

[03:08] <Hova> if any one is going to install beryl stay away from the ati drivers !

[03:09] <nothlit> CyberMad, lol putty is a great piece of remote software
[03:09] <carlo> <agrees about putty
[03:09] <nothlit> CyberMad, inside linux, you would just run ssh inside your terminal program of choice
[03:09] <CyberMad> w3ccv yes i know.. :)

[03:10] <VividHazE> Hey everyone I just have a small problem.  I'm running on a laptop here, and my mousepad thingy that you use to move about on the screen works fine for moving, clicking and double clicking, but I can't do that thing where you say double click on a window header and move it about, or a scroll bar, is this normal, or is there a setting i can change?
[03:10] <miranda> okay thanks LJL
[03:10] <d1gital> apparently i am jesus.
[03:10] <d1gital> nice.
[03:11] <d1gital> shame on you
[03:11] <adeiss> a program that installs several media programs. see www.getautomatix.com
[03:11] <w3ccv> VividHazE, you should have some 'mouse buttons' near that "scratch and sniff" pad
[03:11] <sickOfWork> is there a similar program for linux like remote desktop for windows?
[03:11] <zoredache> sickOfWork: rdesktop
[03:11] <econobeing> oh wait, maybe that wasn't it

[03:12] <miranda> it is not very effective i heard adeiss
[03:12] <AdamKili> nothlit: ok looked at fs-driver.org. I guess that will work, but there's really no way to install ubuntu and windows to a fat32 partition?
[03:12] <VividHazE> w3ccv: yea I do but its always handier to master the mousepad so you only need the right-click button.  I take that to mean it isn't possible to get that to work.
[03:12] <VividHazE> Anyone else have any experience of doing what I want?
[03:12] <econobeing> last time i got it to work i apt-got a 35MB or so file, those utils were only 100k
[03:12] <nothlit> AdamKili, there may be, but it would be incredibly messy and most likely unsafe
[03:12] <nothlit> AdamKili, also, you can't use the regular install cd to do it

[03:12] <LjL> Ubotu, tell econobeing about wifi | econobeing, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:13] <nothlit> AdamKili, it requires unorthodox methods of installation
[03:13] <CyberMad> do i correct? step to install putty are: download the *.deb package at putty website, then install it.  Because i tried apt-get install putty   and doesn't work, or i'm wrong (repository problem?)?
[03:13] <VividHazE> ok thats my first question.  One last question for anyone to answer if they want, my speakers and soundcard works fine but when I put in my headphones into the headphone socket the PC Speakers stop but I can't hear anything on the headphones.  I looked in the volume settings but I can't find anything to turn it on.
[03:13] <VividHazE> Umm, thats all I wanted to know :S
[03:13] <LjL> unorthodox... to say the least :-D there used to be a Slackware version (years ago) that installed to a FAT partition, but i'm not sure that kind of hack is very widely available right now
[03:13] <miranda> brb

[03:14] <d1gital> econobeing:  nvm im pretty sure thats the wrong one too, have you tried running ndiswrapper after installing?
[03:14] <econobeing> it gives me an error when i try to install it
[03:15] <econobeing> "sudo make" at least
[03:15] <carlo> so I made the mistake of removing libjavaplugin.so via the "rm" command... is there a way to undo this?

[03:26] <nothlit> administrator__, you can make an alias in your .bashrc for su

[03:26] <CyberMad> bruenig how to get list of those trigger?
[03:26] <nothlit> yes
[03:26] <administrator__> nothlit, is that for me?
[03:26] <d1gital> V:  you mean your sound card is not detected at all, but you have installed ubuntu on this box before?
[03:26] <bruenig> CyberMad, I don't understand that last statement
[03:27] <LjL> administrator__: depends. "sudo -i" can be useful at times, but yeah, most of the times you want "sudo something". at any rate, if you miss "su -", i'm sure you won't find anything missing with "sudo -i"
[03:27] <V> Yes. There was sound before. But on the seconf instalation, no sound. It's ac97 compliant, realtek
[03:27] <Cubed> LjL: then i need to locate ndiswrapper-utils-1.8.deb or do i specify the folder

[03:28] <LjL> Cubed: well, if you've downloaded it manually, it'll be on the desktop or somewhere in your home, no? you'll need to specify the path unless you're already there, yes.

[03:28] <administrator__> nothlit, see my message to LjL
[03:28] <LjL> administrator__: why do you have a root password, to begin with?
[03:28] <V> I looked for alsa drivers and they are installed
[03:28] <LjL> administrator__: (secondarily, not all users are administrators, obviously. in order for an user to have sudo access, it must be made a member of the "admin" group)
[03:29] <LjL> Ubotu, tell administrator__ about adduser | administrator__, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:29] <bruenig> globe, sudo apt-get install -d package, that will just download the package and not install it. It should be stored in /var/cache/apt/archives

[03:29] <V> But I have 6.06 on cd. The stable version. What do you suggest?
[03:29] <LjL> administrator__: of course. you wouldn't want *every* user on your machine to have sudo access, would you?! i mean, it might be just a home machine, but think if it were something bigger than that
[03:29] <kitche> V: 6.10 is stable
[03:29] <bruenig> globe, yeah there will be a deb in /var/cache/apt/archives, burn that as data

[03:30] <w3ccv> !help > me
[03:30] <d1gital> V: well, i'm not the best with this sort of thing, and i'm sure someone else can make it work, but the only advice i have is that 6.06 is much more supported at the moment, so you might want to give it a try.  however, if it worked before, i'm sure there's a way to make it work again..... i just don't know what that is
[03:30] <globe> bruenig: thanks ;-)
[03:30] <Cubed> LjL: if it is on my desktop, no path name is needed? i thought no path name is needed if it was in the same folder as terminal (wherever that is) - and 1 other thing, what is the difference between sudo -i and dkpg -i?
[03:30] <carlo> so I did the --reinstall install jre... but it's still not showing up in firefox.. anyone have other suggestions?
[03:30] <administrator__> ok thanks guys
[03:30] <administrator__> i try again
[03:30] <Chewy954> bruenig: i use Blag, no1 is in #Blag, and in #Fedora(Blag is based on Fedora with better addons(kinda like ubuntu(apt-get))) no1 will answer me

[03:30] <Chewy954> :|
[03:30] <Valmarko_> I understand. I'm going to install it again. Tanks anyway :)
[03:31] <Cubed> i'm such a noob
[03:31] <Cubed> i think i got this
[03:31] <LjL> Cubed: uh? "sudo" is a command to let you run things with administrator priviledges ("root"), using the "sudo <command>" syntax.  "sudo -i" is a way of saying that you don't just want to run *one* command as administrator, but you want to start a *shell* as administrator (when you're finished, you can use "exit")
[03:31] <bruenig> Chewy954, well the normal source is very easy to do. All you do is extract the tar.gz or whatever it is. Put the extracted directory in /opt or wherever you want it, and then run the swiftfox script in there to launch it
[03:31] <LjL> Cubed: "dpkg" on the other hand is the program that handles .deb files. the "-i" option is for "install"
[03:32] <lemao> why does apt-get/aptitude always looks first at the Server cd first?
[03:32] <Chewy954> ok thx bruenig
[03:32] <Chewy954> =D
[03:32] <Cubed> ok ok ok right right
[03:32] <kitche> lemao: because it's in your source.list
[03:32] <lemao> shoudl it get the package from the web specially when I dont have the cd in the cdrom?
[03:32] <Cubed> i don't know what i was thinking
[03:32] <LjL> Cubed: besides that -- as you correctly said, you can do without the path name only if you're in the right folder, in the terminal. the default folder is your home ("/home/your-username", can also be spelled "~"). the desktop folder is ~/Desktop
[03:32] <kitche> lemo: just comment out the cd part in your source.list then it won't ask for the cd
[03:32] <bruenig> lemao, if you want to remove the server cd from the sources.list, you can do so
[03:33] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Cubed about cli | Cubed, see the private message from Ubotu

[03:33] <lemao> bruenig: by vi'ing into it? or is there a command to manage sources?
[03:33] <nothlit> LjL, no sudo -i is for a login as root, sudo -s is for root shell with user vars

[03:35] <d1gital> lemao:  i've never used that.  no synaptic then?
[03:35] <majortom> is that a not acceptable way to do that though?
[03:35] <Ferramentapenna> as
[03:35] <LjL> nothlit: well, you do end up in a root shell, don't you?
[03:35] <bruenig> d1gital, he is on server I believe, so no gui
[03:36] <d1gital> ooooooooh right. duh.
[03:36] <Cubed> LjL: for the most part, yeah. i know for ubuntu edgy, i need to find ndiswrapper-utils-1.8, take a look here- http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy/Hardware#How_to_install_Windows_Wireless_Drivers_.28Ndiswrapper.29
[03:36] <poisson> Hi everybody. anyone can teach me how to install mod forcedeath (http://www.hailfinger.org/carldani/linux/patches/forcedeth/) ?
[03:36] <lemao> d1gital: no synaptic. Either apt-get/cache or aptitude
[03:36] <Ferramentapenna> Anyone know anything about GBA flash carts or USB bridges?
[03:36] <LjL> !wifi | Cubed, try this one too
[03:36] <ubotu> Cubed, try this one too: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:36] <Cubed> !wifi
[03:36] <bruenig> lemao, did you get it fixed?
[03:36] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:36] <econobeing> sudo apt-get uninstall ndiswrapper-utils
[03:36] <econobeing> heh
[03:37] <d1gital> lemao:  sorry i dont know why i was thinking server would have a gui. anyways, no theres none that i know of
[03:37] <Cubed> lol, if i had the internet i wouldn't need to use apt-get!!!!!!
[03:37] <d1gital> lemao:  vi looks like the way to go
[03:37] <Cubed> not for this package
[03:38] <nothlit> LjL, yeah but its a login shell as admin, what you said would be the way to describe sudo -s...
[03:38] <Ferramentapenna> Can someone help me with flash carts for backing up GBA games?
[03:38] <lemao> bruenig & d1gital: ok. just dbl checking to see if there was a better way. Thanks!
[03:39] <LjL> nothlit: alright. keep in mind that the original question was about what difference there was between the commands "sudo -i" and "dpkg -i" ;-)
[03:39] <d1gital> Ferramentapenna:  shouldn't it just be recognized as a removable drive?
[03:39] <Ferramentapenna> Digital:  Sadly, it is not.  Other things, such as regular flash drives and cameras, work fine though.
[03:39] <sysdoc> With flash cards, LMAO!
[03:40] <Cubed> lol
[03:40] <econobeing> today is not my day
[03:40] <Pelo> Ferramentapenna,  did you try looking up the specific model in the forum ?
[03:40] <Ferramentapenna> Pelo:  I didn't see anything on the wiki or forums about it, but will check again to confirm.
[03:41] <sysdoc> lol, I read flash cards, and thought that was the funniest request for help I have seen in a good long while... Please excuse humor...lol
[03:41] <Cubed> LjL: --- after i install the deb package using dpkg -i, then i use sudo to install the wireless driver, correct?
[03:41] <Pelo> Ferramentapenna,  just put the make and model in the search field,  you'd be surprise,   try generic name or family of product as well
[03:41] <Ferramentapenna> Sysdoc:  No problem.  Ideally, I want all my games on a single GBA cartridge with flash memory.  Not quite the same as a flash card.
[03:42] <sysdoc> :)
[03:42] <LjL> Cubed: i've never really dealt with wireless. but for that matter, you need sudo for running dpkg as well - you can't install .deb files while you're not root
[03:42] <sysdoc> I hear ya
[03:42] <monQ> hi all
[03:43] <Ferramentapenna> Pelo:  Not seeing -anything- regarding flash carts, GBA flash, or EZF-Advance, which is the cart I use (And is going to get replaced because it's crap.  >.<)

[03:43] <monQ> i've just d/l ubuntu 6.10 desktop. I'm suprised the installation method completely change
[03:44] <monQ> is there anyway to do installation on cli?
[03:44] <Pelo> Ferramentapenna,  maybe you can try googling for linux divers or app for gba
[03:44] <Cubed> LjL: oops, i mean i need to run sudo dkpg -i (location of package) and then use sudo ndiswrapper (and specify my windows driver inf) - ndiswrapper is a program to install wireless windows drivers
[03:44] <monQ> i mean like debian way
[03:45] <Cubed> LjL: does that help you see what i'm trying to do
[03:45] <kitche> monQ: the alternate Cd has the debian installer on it
[03:45] <sysdoc> Ferramentapenna, I gotta tell ya if I hadn't read that incorrectly, I would have went and found ya the answer if I didn't know it, just because "show me with flash cards" has got to be one of the freshest phraseology's I have heard in a long time

He places the pen at the tip of your urethra (the shaft at the tip of the penis through which your urine and sperm leave your body) and he pushes it in, all the way. As it resists, he pushes harder, until it bleeds all over you. He continues to push the pen down until it punctures your bladder. With the pen stil

[03:55] <stickman> thanks. i go try that now.
[03:55] <majortom> stickman: then just restart gnome or kde whichever you're using

[03:55] <majortom> yep
[03:57] <Zelda> well thanks people. I'll come back when I need some more help
[03:57] <Zelda> another question though
[03:57] <Zelda> ubuntu all installs the same for everyone right? Unless they download other software. Or are there different versions of Ubuntu?
[03:58] <LjL> Zelda: there are different versions and flavors.
[03:59] <Zelda> yes I appreciate it
[03:59] <Zelda> Im new to linux. I have alot of catching up on
[04:00] <Zelda> like whats the difference between KDE and Gnome
[04:00] <Zelda> is there a basic linux tutorial or information page somewhere?
[04:00] <LjL> Zelda: they're two quite different desktop environments, based on different GUI toolkits. it's like looking at two different operating systems, if you just go by the look and feel, mostly
[04:01] <Zelda> like a wikipedia on linux?
[04:01] <LjL> Zelda: start at http://help.ubuntu.com/community
[04:01] <LjL> Zelda: that's a wiki, yes
[04:01] <Zelda> where I could get answers to most my linux questions?
[04:01] <LjL> Zelda: probably here
[04:02] <Zelda> for ubuntu specific though right?
[04:02] <LjL> Zelda: yes, but we don't mind if you ask about things that work the same in all distributions
[04:02] <stickman> majortom, that did it.  i was able to do a startx on display 1.
[04:02] <LjL> Zelda: just don't ask "how to install RedHat" or things like that :)
[04:02] <majortom> stickman: woopie!
[04:02] <Zelda> of course not
[04:03] <majortom> stickman: i had similar problem that took me forever and i never forgot it, but that was when i was using 5.04
[04:03] <Zelda> just general questions about linux. Im starting to learn so I can switch over soon.
[04:04] <engla> Zelda: linuxquestions.org ? ;-)
[04:04] <LjL> Zelda: if they're not support questions, but more like "does linux...?" (not sure if i'm explaining myself), maybe #ubuntu-offtopic could be better
[04:05] <Zelda> well Im installing ubuntu so its going to be about ubuntu.
[04:05] <kitche> Zelda: the ubuntu book might be good for you
[04:05] <engla> !forums
[04:05] <ubotu> The Ubuntu forums can be found at http://www.ubuntuforums.org. There is also a channel on IRC Freenode #ubuntuforums.
[04:06] <Zelda> I can get that at like Barnes and Noble?
[04:06] <Pelo> Zelda,  these maybe intersting to you http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84 http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/  http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php
[04:06] <Zelda> ok Ill write that down.
[04:06] <LjL> Zelda: one of the first things you probably want to learn about is the packaging system. if you're used to Windows, Ubuntu has a different approach to installing software
[04:06] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Zelda about software | Zelda, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:07] <Zelda> yeah.
[04:07] <seamus7> hi... I'm setting up Edgy and wonder what's the difference between the two JavaRE's presented in the unofficial Edgy customization guide here: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_J2SE_Runtime_Environment_.28JRE.29_with_Plug-in_for_Mozilla_Firefox
[04:07] <zac1> !.deb
[04:07] <ubotu> deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[04:07] <Cubed> ok ok ok ok i'm almost rteady
[04:07] <zac1> !.rpm
[04:07] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[04:08] <stacey_> is it possible to upgrade to Edgy from breezy without much trouble?
[04:08] <mipstien> I am looking for a command that can run a program from terminal but release the terminal to allow for further use from it.
[04:08] <LjL> stacey_: not directly, you must go through dapper
[04:08] <LjL> Ubotu, tell stacey_ about upgrade | stacey_, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:08] <asgilder> I had to reinstall GRUB, because I reinstalled windows on my system. Now neither system will boot. HELP!

[04:09] <Pelo> mipstien,  you can have multiple terminals open
[04:09] <majortom> LjL: is there a list of all the things that Ubotu can tell me when i "!"?
[04:09] <mipstien> but i would like to close my current terminal and just leave the program running.

[04:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about 4 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:10] <Pelo> mipstien,  you can try starting the program with alt-f2
[04:10] <mipstien> pelo, the program needs to be run from root, i had already tried alt + f2 and had no luck with it :(
[04:11] <zac1> 8-(

[04:11] <administrator_> hi
[04:11] <Pelo> mipstien,  alt-f2 :  gksu program-name, you will be asked for password
[04:11] <administrator_> how do i install vmware
[04:11] <administrator_> pls
[04:11] <LjL> !vmware-player
[04:11] <mipstien> pelo thank you
[04:11] <administrator_> with rpm

[04:12] <LjL> Ubotu, tell administrator_ about rpm | administrator_, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:12] <jrib> mipstien: maybe you can do 'gksudo program_command'.  Or to answer what you asked, use 'disown' on the job before closing your terminal
[04:12] <stickman> majortom, the installer is running now.  i should be set in a few minutes.  thanks for the help.  that would have taken me forever to fix.
[04:12] <mipstien> gksu works for what i need, thank you jrib
[04:13] <seamus7> This seems to stump a lot of people.... What's the difference between  sun-java5-jre  AND  jre-1_5_0_10?  They're both presented in the unofficial Edgy customization guide but an explanation as to their difference isn't given.
[04:13] <majortom> stickman: oh you're still on the live cd?  you may have to do it again when you boot from your hard disk...
[04:13] <LjL> seamus7: what guide would that be?
[04:13] <stickman> that's ok.  now that i know what the fix is, it's not an issue.
[04:13] <nothlit> seamus7, i think the  regular jre is blackdown
[04:14] <seamus7> LjL: this one... http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_J2SE_Runtime_Environment_.28JRE.29_with_Plug-in_for_Mozilla_Firefox
[04:14] <mipstien> jrib how does the 'disown' command work?
[04:14] <SilentDis> hello
[04:15] <rubix_> whats up...lookin up parts for a new PC i want to build
[04:15] <LjL> seamus7: that's the JRE archive that comes from the Sun site. it's not in .deb format (which is what Ubuntu uses), so instead Ubuntu provides the sun-java5-jre package
[04:16] <seamus7> nothlit: they're both from Sun and they're both JRE's .... aren't they the same thing? why does one say update 10 and the other does not? why does one have a firefox plugin but the one with update 10 does not? this is confusing. No one seems to know the difference.
[04:16] <LjL> seamus7: i suppose it might be more up-to-date than the package that is included in Ubuntu, but if you ask me, i'd install the latter anyway
[04:16] <SilentDis> problem:  installing Edgy, chose to manually edit partition table.  gparted appears to to start up, then runs dosfsck -a -v /dev/hdb2 in the background, and hangs, using most all the cpu time.  /dev/hdb2 is a 25gb Fat32 system.  The drive light doesn't appear to be flashing or anything.
[04:17] <seamus7> LjL: I installed the JRE update 10 but am wondering if that also created the plugin for Firefox and put it in the correct folder.
[04:17] <rubix_> SilentDis: try doing a full hdd wipe if you can
[04:17] <kitche> seamus7: the one from sun's site does include a plugin if you have all your configs setup right
[04:17] <LjL> seamus7: Ubuntu is a "distribution". this means that it packages software made by third parties. so, obviously, you'll be able to get the same software from *both* the third party and the Ubuntu repositories - but normally you'd just use the repositories, since that's what they exist for
[04:17] <SilentDis> rubix_: can't.  this is a functioning dapper system.  got all my backups on that partition :P
[04:17] <jrib> mipstien: do you know about 'jobs' and 'fg' and 'bg' and all that fun stuff?
[04:17] <rubix_> i had that problem when installing
[04:18] <max_> how do you format a floppy disk?
[04:18] <SilentDis> rubix_: was just looking to wipe /dev/hda2 (/ mount point) and setup edgy in there instead.
[04:18] <seamus7> LjL: so the ubuntu deb is an older version and in order to get update 10 I had to go to Sun's Java site?
[04:18] <rubix_> this is an old piii laptop though
[04:18] <rubix_> seamus7: yes
[04:18] <mipstien> jrib, i don't believe so
[04:18] <SilentDis> !floppy | max_
[04:18] <ubotu> max_: To mount floppy disks, see here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MakeFloppyDriveAvailableToEveryone
[04:18] <rubix_> seamus7: apt-get remove the jre and then install the one from sun's site, or try to find a newer repository with the package you need
[04:18] <stickman> does update 10 come with the browser plugin?
[04:18] <jrib> mipstien: alright, you know 'gedit &' puts gedit in the background, so run that now.  Afterwards, type 'jobs'
[04:19] <max_> thank you
[04:19] <stickman> i could have sworn that it did.
[04:19] <kritical> Does anyone know how to setup in /etc/fstab the permissions for when a file is created by the user? I'm mounting a network drive and the default permissions for newly created files appear to be read-only for users
[04:19] <LjL> seamus7: i assume that's the reason why ubuntuguide.org mentions it, yes
[04:19] <mipstien> jrib ah, that is perfect for what i need :)
[04:19] <Anarch> In aptitude in "i A   gcc-4.0", what does "A" mean?
[04:19] <SilentDis> hmm... gonna see what errors are kicking out from that drive.  bbiab if I can't figure this out myself, but at least I'll have more info :)
[04:20] <mipstien> jrib, i am tryin to run gproftp without the terminal, i just got a new PDA phone and wanted to have an FTP on my box so i could get any of my files any time i was away
[04:20] <LjL> seamus7: generally speaking, it's quite likely that packages that are in the Ubuntu repositories are older than the "latest" version. but, on the other hand, they were made explicitly for Ubuntu, so they are easy to install and should work well with the rest of the system - which is not guaranteed otherwise
[04:20] <jrib> mipstien: well now you can run 'disown %1' and close your terminal.  If gedit was actual job 2 you would use %2 of course
[04:20] <administrator_> how do i uninstall a deb package
[04:20] <jrib> !deb | administrator_
[04:20] <ubotu> administrator_: deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[04:20] <LjL> administrator_: sudo apt-get remove <package>
[04:20] <seamus7> Oh ok now I understand.... I already uninstalled my jre and installed the update 10 version.. I just wanted to be clear that the ubuntu package was the older version I guess and the guide didn't quite make that clear .. at least to a relative newbie like me
[04:20] <kritical> administrator_, sudo apt-get remove pakage
[04:20] <jrib> oh he said "uninstall" :x
[04:21] <kitche> seamus7: the ubuntu packages is update 9
[04:21] <ThePub> after installing kubuntu-desktop under gnome I can no longer see directories I don't directly own, anyone happen to know what setting kubuntu changes?  (if I show hidden files things like /etc will appear, didn't used to be that way)
[04:21] <Anarch> In aptitude in "i A   gcc-4.0", what does "A" mean?
[04:21] <LjL> jrib: you're not excused. 4am here and i still got it right :P
[04:21] <stacey__> thats why BOTS are annoying
[04:22] <LjL> stacey__: ?
[04:22] <stacey__> Every other question, someone is using a bot to answer
[04:22] <LjL> and?
[04:22] <seamus7> kitche: I used Automatix2 for the first time ... I had previously avoided it... and it seemed to install JRE update 8 .... I had thought it would install update 10
[04:22] <stacey__> Its annoying to me ... very annnoying
[04:22] <kitche> seamus7: well automatix is a bad thing to use anyways :P
[04:22] <LjL> stacey__: your problem, i suppose
[04:22] <kitche> stacey__: just ingore ubotu then
[04:23] <stacey__> kitche, thats what I need to do
[04:23] <seamus7> kitche: I had heard that but thought I'd give it a try since its being actively developed
=== CyberMad is now known as cybermad
[04:23] <majortom> so... nobody uses synaptic?
[04:23] <OneSeventeen> I cannot ping google.com but I can ping their IP address, how to I get new DNS records?
[04:23] <ThePub> stacey__: who cares as long as there is an answer that is reasonable and on-the-point?
[04:23] <mipstien> jrib thank you soooo much for that help, that is awesome, got to learn a new command set today :)
[04:23] <hou5ton> seamus7:   I've tried automatix2 and so far have not had any trouble with it
[04:23] <ThePub> ok, better question.. what adds ".hidden" files everywhere? :)
[04:24] <jrib> mipstien: http://www.faqs.org/docs/bashman/bashref_78.html
[04:24] <LjL> !works for me | hou5ton
[04:24] <ubotu> hou5ton: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[04:24] <seamus7> kitche: I generall use synaptic but i just installed edgy on my new laptop as a dual boot with winxp and was a bit tired so I opted for Automatix2
[04:24] <LjL> ThePub: file*s*? there is one file called "/.hidden" in the root, but...
[04:24] <mipstien> jrib, thank you, i couldn't find anything like that anywhere :(
[04:24] <ThePub> LjL: after installing kubuntu it seems I have a whole bunch of them everywhere
[04:24] <OneSeventeen> is there an ubuntu equivalent to dnsflush?
[04:24] <jrib> mipstien: np
[04:25] <hou5ton> LjL:   I understand what you say, and agree ... but just saying that maybe it is better than it might have been in the beginning?
[04:25] <LjL> ThePub: like where? i don't think that's right
[04:25] <seamus7> hou5ton: yeah it went well for me today ... but I still need to install Azureus from the Azureus site in order to fix some bugs in the Ubuntu repository version
[04:25] <stacey__> ThePub, I care, simply because they dont answer a persons question all the time.. and usually the person who sends the bot message doesnt know either, he just knows alot of links
[04:25] <LjL> hou5ton: not if i have to go by the painful automatix troubleshooting sessions i and others have had to deal recently
[04:25] <ThePub> LjL: there's one in /.hidden.. one in my media directory.. all over the place actually.  anywhere root owns the directory it seems there's a .hidden there with that directory name in it
[04:26] <Anarch> In aptitude in "i A   gcc-4.0", what does "A" mean?
[04:26] <ThePub> stacey__: yeah, like I said.  as long as it is on-the-point and answers the question.  if it doesn't, totally understandable that it coule be annoying :)
[04:27] <stacey__> ThePub, Personally, if I cant answer a persons question, Im not going to shove a bot answer in their face.  They are convinient for FAQ, but anything else... meh
[04:28] <ThePub> stacey__: you have to admit though, many times people don't first read those or do a cursery search on the wiki though.
[04:28] <SilentDis> found my problem.  a file was fscked up on the drive, and fsck was returning an error.  hosed the file, fsck reported clear, no more problem :)
[04:28] <LjL> !offtopic | ThePub, stacey__
[04:28] <ubotu> ThePub, stacey__: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[04:28] <stacey__> ThePub, I agree with that
[04:29] <LjL> ThePub: i have one in /media too
[04:29] <stacey__> LjL, if you do that again, I will find you
[04:29] <LjL> stacey__: you will... find me?
[04:29] <ThePub> LjL: I'm happy for you.  What makes the links?
[04:29] <LjL> ThePub: i haven't the slightest idea
[04:30] <stacey__> LjL, just dont do that again, please.  Last time

[04:31] <LjL> ThePub: that's about the only one i have, though, besides the one in /
[04:31] <ThePub> LjL: they're an annoyance, and I wanted to find out what makes them so as to avoid this in the future :)
[04:32] <ThePub> LjL:  I'll find it eventually, but if someone knew it doesn't hurt to ask eh? ^^
[04:32] <LjL> ThePub: if that's of any comfort, i think that .hidden "feature" is being dropped in edgy
[04:32] <ThePub> LjL: I'm running edgy atm
[04:32] <LjL> err i mean feisty
[04:33] <ThePub> LjL: and it's something in kubuntu-desktop.. so I'm tracking through the dependencies atm.
[04:33] <Anarch> In aptitude in "i A   gcc-4.0", what does "A" mean?
[04:33] <mirk> czer323: you around?
[04:33] <kitche> Anarch: it's on the tip of my head but can't remember it
[04:34] <czer323> mirk, yep
[04:34] <lovloss> !pastebin
[04:34] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:34] <Anarch> kitche: Thanks for answering.  Do you know of any documentation of aptitude that's better than <https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/C/aptitude.html>?
[04:35] <kitche> Anarch: hang on trying to find the page
[04:35] <AngryElf> so, given that all the md5 sums checked out why would an Xubuntu CD boot and a Kubuntu and Ubuntu CD not? -- they both lock up at "adding live CD user"...
[04:35] <mirk> sec, czer
[04:36] <ThePub> maybe someone with the ati 8.31 driver, a big desktop and movie player can enlighten me on why video overlay doesn't cover both screens by default?  Videos on the second desktop "scroll away" when my mouse approach that desktop.
[04:36] <kitche> Anarch: I think man aptitude might tell you hat since I rememebr seeing it in there
[04:37] <lovloss> Alright guys, i set this up well so please help me out. I cant egt my computer to start gdm because it gives me errors for my nvidia card. I recently installed Beryl AIGLX, and then got the unofficial updates on their Wiki. Everything worked yesterday. Here's my xorg log : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35873/
[04:37] <globe> Would anyone want to help me with ndiswrapper and a belkin usb wifi adapter? I have the driver installed and ndis says that it is loaded and the hdware present, but no ethernet connection
[04:37] <thejapa> ThePub: I'm on debian, it happens too. it's a known bug afaik
[04:37] <seamus7> Which folder or folders ought the Flash9Beta2 Plugin go in? Putting it in /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree/ doesn't seem to do the trick for Firefox.
[04:37] <lovloss> If anyone can see the problem i would be most grateful
[04:37] <crimsun> seamus7: that's because ff's plugin dir is /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
[04:38] <ThePub> thejapa: really?  where'd you read that?  I've just not been able to find any reasons.  The open source driver doesn't have the issue, which is just doubly annoying :)
[04:38] <crimsun> seamus7: (or ~/.mozilla/plugins/ )
[04:38] <SilentDis> seamus7:  i believe it can be placed in ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile>/plugins... or something like that
[04:38] <SilentDis> seamus7:  or, yeah, for all users, crimson's info works
[04:38] <seamus7> Would it create any sort of problems to put it in all of these folder mentioned?
[04:38] <thejapa> ThePub: well, you've seen it, I've seen it, that's known enough for me.
[04:38] <Anarch> kitche: My `man aptitude` only shows the command-line interface.
[04:39] <ThePub> seamus7:  outside of your local install (best place) is /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/lib (something like that)
[04:39] <seamus7> ok thx
[04:39] <Anarch> kitche: And my `info aptitude` is just a copy of `man aptitude`.
[04:40] <thejapa> ThePub: I could have chosen better my words, of course, i just never found a solution too.
[04:40] <ThePub> thejapa: it's almost like the video overlay is on a seperate resolution or something because the scrolling is reminiscent of using a viewport.
[04:41] <thejapa> ThePub: it looks to me like it's using a fullscreen-size offscreenframe, when it is drawn on a x window, it simply scrolls automatically
[04:41] <jerp> clonebots are naughty
[04:41] <kitche> Anarch: I know I seen it someplace check aptitudes help system when you run it in interactive mode
[04:41] <thejapa> ThePub: very annoying
[04:41] <asgilder> \How do you find where your boot partition is?
[04:42] <jrib> Anarch: maybe /usr/share/doc/aptitude
[04:42] <asgilder> !/boot
[04:42] <ubotu> Boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions - To add/remove startup services, you can use the package 'bum', or update-rc.d - To add your own startup scripts, use /etc/rc.local - See also !grub and !dualboot - Making a boot floppy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy - Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto
[04:42] <lovloss> Nobody can help me? ;.;
[04:42] <ThePub> lovloss: don't have an nvidia card, but the ati setup went really smooth.. if that's any help ;)
[04:42] <SilentDis> lovloss:  missed the question... repeat please?
[04:43] <sandy16> how to know the dependencies of a particular package?
[04:43] <Anarch> jrib: /me browses that now
[04:43] <lovloss> I cant egt my computer to start gdm because it gives me errors for my nvidia card. I recently installed Beryl AIGLX, and then got the unofficial updates on their Wiki. Everything worked yesterday. Here's my xorg log : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35873/
[04:43] <jerp> I'd like to get that scroll with wallpaper like in suse during boot up
[04:43] <thejapa> ThePub: one solution i've not tried yet is by not using xinerama
[04:43] <lovloss> ThePub : >.<
[04:43] <ThePub> sandy16: what package tool are you using?  if you're using synaptic, right-click and choose properties then click on "dependencies"
[04:43] <SilentDis> lovloss:  checking out the pastebin now... just curious, have you checked in over in the glx help room as well?
[04:44] <SilentDis> !beryl | lovloss
[04:44] <ubotu> lovloss: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[04:44] <asgilder> Okay...!/boot didn't help.
[04:44] <minerale> so I'm looking at grub version 2 and it seems interesting, i'm thinking on installing it -- does anyone know if I'm about to fry my computer? I have moderate experience with grub
[04:44] <ThePub> thejapa: I have tried that, and it works beutifully w/o a big desktop (not xinerama, fglrx doesn't support that).  If you have multi-head and use two x servers there's no issues.
[04:44] <lovloss> SilentDis: I went to #beryl... and they just ignored me
[04:44] <sandy16> ThePub, can i expect any way using terminal?
[04:44] <SilentDis> lovloss:  #ubuntu-xgl is the room you're looking for ;)
[04:44] <thejapa> ThePub: oh, you're right, i'm using big desktop
[04:45] <lovloss> SilentDis: nobody is in tehre o.o
[04:45] <SilentDis> lovloss:  looks like something to do with font rendering problems...
[04:45] <lovloss> ah im in the chat now
[04:45] <khoa> when i do apt-get update && apt-get upgrade, it's telling me 2 packages (libggi and mplayer) are being held back
[04:46] <khoa> is there a reason for that?
[04:46] <ThePub> sandy16: sure, "apt-cache depends <pkgname>"
[04:46] <SilentDis> lovloss:  looks like the last 3 lines are your 'key'.  x is having problem loading font path elements for some reason.
[04:46] <ThePub> sandy16: may want to read the man page for apt-cache, it's the apt search tool and information dispenser :)
[04:46] <jrib> Anarch: http://people.debian.org/~dburrows/aptitude-doc/en/ch02s02s02.html
[04:46] <lovloss> SilentDis: Hmm that does seem like the problem. Strange that *font* problems would cause it crash
[04:47] <kitche> lovloss: how are you trying to start beryl?
[04:47] <globe> Would anyone want to help me with ndiswrapper and a belkin usb wifi adapter? I have the driver installed and ndis says that it is loaded and the hdware present, but no ethernet connection
[04:47] <crparr> Hi! I'm trying to set up my wireless connection. I've got an IPW2200BG. I'd like to connect via WPA2 encryption. I tried this (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=296790) - no success. I installed networkmanager-kde - it does not even display my wlan card. What am I doing wrong?
[04:47] <lovloss> beryl-manager... but im on a live cd now, kitche.
[04:47] <yakumo> hello anyone know how to remove the media icon on my desktop im using dapper drake?
[04:47] <lovloss> it wont load up normally
[04:47] <pi1l> can I quickly and painlessly upgrade my 6.06 to 6.10 ?
[04:47] <SilentDis> lovloss:  eh, if it can't load ANY fonts...  i could see it.  i'm rather a newb when it comes to x in general though.  i spent most of my last 6 years of *nix experience at a terminal prompt rofl
[04:47] <jrib> !icons | yakumo
[04:47] <ubotu> yakumo: Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[04:47] <jrib> !upgrade | pi1l
[04:47] <dyzlex> Ok, I have XP Pro x64 installed, and an empty 4gb partition I want to install 6.06 onto. How would I go about a dual boot and not kill my Windows Partition?
[04:47] <ubotu> pi1l: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:47] <lovloss> ^_^
[04:48] <sandy16> ThePub, i am trying to develop a my own CD so that it can be apt able, is that possible?
[04:48] <lovloss> dyzlex: it comes with Ubuntu's installation. You just set aside the patrition :)
[04:48] <yakumo> ill try thanks
[04:48] <SilentDis> dyzlex:  is your drive currently setup as [windows] [empty partition] ?
[04:48] <lovloss> dyzlex: When you get to the installation menu choose to manage partitions manually
[04:48] <ThePub> sandy16: sure, you can develop local repositories with apt.  that's a bit beyond me though.  idk if the ubuntu site has information on that, but I'm positive debian does.
[04:48] <drcode> hi all
[04:49] <pi1l> jrib, thank you
[04:49] <dyzlex> I think I formatted the partition to NTFS by mistake,
[04:49] <drcode> I try to call my linux from home to linux server
[04:49] <drcode> with modem
[04:49] <dyzlex> So will Ubuntu install onto NTFS?
[04:49] <drcode> I use pppd
[04:49] <pi1l> !upgrade
[04:49] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:49] <lovloss> dyzlex: no, but use "gnome part ed" from administrative tasks under "system"
[04:49] <pi1l> dyzlex no ofcourse!
[04:49] <dyzlex> But yes, its [Windows] [empty partition] 
[04:49] <drcode> it start to connect but it dissconnect all the time in CONNECT exepted
[04:49] <kitche> ah ubuntu has dfs
[04:49] <drcode> I have also try wvdial
[04:49] <lovloss> dyzlex: delete the ntfs partition, change it to ext3 :)
[04:49] <pi1l> !k3b
[04:49] <ubotu> k3b is a feature-rich and user-friendly burning application for KDE (and, as all KDE applications, works fine on GNOME). For a guide, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/K3BHowto
[04:50] <dyzlex> lovloss: I tried that last time, and it killed off my Windows partition.
[04:50] <drcode> it connect ok but try to run ppp witch give command not found
[04:50] <SilentDis> dyzlex:  that's not a problem.  during the install, you can choose to format it (either ext2 or ext3 are recommended).  windows will be left intact.
[04:50] <drcode> any idea?
[04:50] <ThePub> dyzlex: ntfs isn't a safe partition type to use, but it won't *install* into it w/o alot of finesing.
[04:50] <Anarch> jrib: That looks like pretty good documentation, thanks.  I don't yet see docs of the chars following the state & action flags but am still looking.
[04:50] <lovloss> dyxlex: o.O
[04:50] <bun-bun> when installing windows programs via wine should it be done as superuser or not?
[04:50] <SilentDis> dyzlex:  when you're asked to pick a partition, choose manual.
[04:50] <jrib> Anarch: that's the same as /usr/share/doc/aptitude I believe
[04:50] <ThePub> dyzlex: parted can do wondeful resizing tricks though if you're worried about space.
[04:50] <sandy16> ThePub, Really, i never found some thing like that .. but if some thing like is there .. oh thats great .. could you please pass on the link for me?
[04:50] <jrib> Anarch: the page I linked to explains the "A" at the top
[04:51] <dyzlex> OK, ill try that. And after it installs, how would I access the windows partition?
[04:51] <SilentDis> bun-bun:  probably best as normal user, depending on the app.... and how many users you have on your pc, etc.
[04:51] <ThePub> sandy16: I really wouldn't know, been years since I've read about that sort of thing :)
[04:51] <n3rdism> good evening my fellow ubuntites
[04:51] <SilentDis> dyzlex:  grub will be installed for you, and you'll get to pick your os on boot.
[04:51] <dyzlex> ThePub: Thats what killed my partition last time.
[04:51] <SilentDis> dyzlex:  also, from inside ubuntu, you'll be able to 'see' the files on your NTFS partition (just not write to it... unless you install other tools)
[04:51] <bun-bun> SilentDis# i'm just not sure if needs to be able to write to the wine lib directories or not
[04:52] <Anarch> jrib: Right, I see it: "A" is "automatically installed".  Thanks!
[04:52] <jrib> Anarch: np
[04:52] <bun-bun> SilentDis# i'm the only user so that's not an issue
[04:52] <SilentDis> bun-bun:  i'd say try installing it as regular user, and see what happens.  if it borks, you'll at least get an error message of what's going wrong ;)
[04:53] <dyzlex> Ok, now it says I need a swap partition too. What do I do?
[04:53] <yakumo> <ubotu>i only want to remove the mounted hard disk on my desktop, any ideas???? :)

[04:53] <jrib> kitche: what was?  the aptitude docs are in /usr/share/doc/aptitude/ if that's what you mean
[04:53] <m-hussein> i am your favourite muslim
[04:53] <Anarch> jrib: My /usr/share/doc/aptitude doesn't have this stuff (yet) because aptitude-doc wasn't installed ... but of course, before doing any installations, I wanted to grok aptitude.  So I was in a Catch-22; that's why your help was so important.  You can't RTFM if you don't /have/ TFM.

[04:54] <SilentDis> Thank you DBO
[04:54] <xar0s> why?
[04:54] <sandy16> ThePub, where will the apt-get update information will be stored?
[04:55] <bun-bun> SilentDis# and i haven't been successful in getting them to improve it..  i've used the linux port and it leaks memory quite badly.. and the source won't compile so i'm resorting to using wine
[04:55] <jerp> !umount | yakumo
[04:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about umount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:55] <SilentDis> bun-bun:  it's a yahoo mail checker?  is that all it does?  i'm almost certain I saw something like that in the package list...
[04:55] <dyzlex> So the swap has to be a seperate partition?
[04:56] <SilentDis> bun-bun: ahhhh
[04:56] <bun-bun> SilentDis# yes, i've looked at the others and none have the same functionality as this program
[04:56] <yakumo> <jerp>but it will remove my mouted volume.
[04:56] <bun-bun> SilentDis# it's a good program, i just wish the programmers were linux first and windows second, as opposed to vice versa
[04:56] <ThePub> sandy16: deb archives are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives
[04:56] <ThePub> sandy16: you should never have a reason to get in there on a dailly-user 'sane' machine
[04:57] <SilentDis> bun-bun:  from what you've told me of what it does, the absolute most it'll need is access to a 'tray' of sorts most likely... and i believe wine allows for that as user-installed apps.
[04:57] <sandy16> ThePub, i know that .. but what about the indexes that are fetched while apt-get updating
[04:58] <n3rdism> they seriously need to package kino and lmms in the next release..

[04:58] <SilentDis> bun-bun:  bit off-topic...  and I apologize... i assume that's bun-bun from the UF comic you've named yourself after?  lol

[05:01] <Ahab> I am compiling software for the first time and have a question (I've read the wiki already).  I've downloaded the source and am ready to extract the contents, where should I do that, what directory?
[05:01] <yakumo> <jerp>but using 5.10 you can easly remove the desktop icon but here in dapper drake i don't have an idea.
[05:01] <jerp> yakumo, when I sue those panel gizmos in gnome, the mount drives gizmo says I have two floppies
[05:02] <jerp> use
[05:02] <n3rdism> ahab: usr/bin
[05:02] <eternal_p> :)
[05:02] <Ahab> thanks
[05:02] <globe> Would anyone want to help me with ndiswrapper?
[05:02] <xar0s> globe: yea whatcha need?
[05:02] <jerp> yakumo, have you tried to refresh the desktop?
[05:03] <yakumo> no..:)
[05:03] <n3rdism> woah, we have screencasts o.O ubuntuclips.org
[05:03] <SilentDis> ok, i'm slowing down my piddly dialup way too much during this install.  take care all, i'm out :)
[05:04] <globe> xar0s I cannot get it to register the ethernet device....the driver is loaded, but no wifi
[05:04] <jerp> yakumo, do you use gnome?
[05:04] <xar0s> globe: what card do you have
[05:04] <xar0s> and gnome or kde?
[05:04] <yakumo> yup
[05:04] <globe> its as belkin usb f5d7050 ver 3000
[05:05] <jerp> open a terminal and type _   killall nautilus
[05:05] <yakumo> <jerp>yup i use gnome
[05:05] <Catshrimp> Ah, finally up and running on the *nix system :)
[05:05] <jerp> it might rid the icon then
[05:05] <xar0s> globe, oh dear...  i had a belkin for the longest time.. doesnt work to well
[05:05] <xar0s> globe: are you running dapper?
[05:05] <quantux> I'm using a belkin right now, but the internal pci kind
[05:06] <Catshrimp> So, here's the deal.  I've never run *nix as a desktop before and want to make sure I know what I need to get a gui running.  Do I only need to download/configure the xserver and a window manager?
[05:06] <xar0s> i am too... but it was horrible to set up
[05:06] <globe> xar0s gnome
[05:06] <xar0s> ok... thats good..
[05:06] <quantux> ubuntu has always auto set mine up
[05:06] <n3rdism> globe: if it is at all possible to get a different device. look for something that supports atheros (most netgear). 80% chance it will work out of the box
[05:07] <quantux> I didn't even realize it until I noticed I was browsing the web during the install...
[05:07] <xar0s> globe'  if you type 'iwconfig' into terminal, what readout do you get
[05:07] <quantux> it just set it up, and hooked up to the first open access point
[05:07] <Catshrimp> quantux: I'd rather not have ubuntu install a bunch of stuff that I'll never use.  So I opted to install the base server package and go from there =)
[05:07] <Catshrimp> quantux: oh, nevermind, thought you were referring to my question
[05:08] <globe> xar0s oh boy lag....
[05:09] <xar0s> lol... poor globe
[05:09] <globe> xar0s eth0, lo, sit0 no wireless connections
[05:09] <xar0s> ok
[05:09] <xar0s> globe have you modprobed ndiswrapper?
[05:09] <globe> yep.
[05:10] <Captain_Apathy> hi everyone, I have a question, can ubuntu read/write ntfs file systems and if so can someone refer me to a page where I can read up on how to do it?
[05:10] <xar0s> and you are using the correct windoes driver?
[05:10] <globe> xar0s: afik....
[05:10] <kitche> !ntfs| Captain_Apathy
[05:10] <ubotu> Captain_Apathy: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[05:10] <globe> xar0s: is there a way to check that?
[05:11] <xar0s> do you have a windows box?

[05:11] <Captain_Apathy> thanks for the page ubotu

[05:11] <lemonsCC> what is the default irc client in ubuntu?
[05:11] <majestik> so, if i add an user with the command useradd, will i have to configure something for entering gnome as it did with my default user?
[05:11] <x-r00t-x> how do i install cgi on apache2?
[05:11] <globe> lemonsCC irssi

[05:12] <wolv3rin3> hello
[05:12] <xar0s> globe: plug the card in and go into device manager. then see what driver it loads, make sure you use THAT driver in ubuntu
[05:12] <lemonsCC> i am on my mac i forgot what ubuntu uses =P
[05:13] <CientificoLoco> I have some problems with the instaltion of mecury ...
[05:13] <globe> xar0s ... well... that might not work. I am already on the wireless with a netgear pcmcia card on this windows box. the nix is a desktop
[05:13] <majestik> anyone?
[05:13] <CientificoLoco> when I type mercury on the terminal I get Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/dMSN/Main...
[05:14] <xar0s> globe: ah... that could be a problem
[05:14] <administrator__> hi

[05:14] <globe> yep...
[05:14] <xar0s> globe: you said its usb though... riht?
[05:14] <administrator__> some built in commands in my bash version is not working properly
[05:14] <administrator__> can someone help me pls
[05:14] <globe> xar0s correct
[05:15] <xar0s> so just plug 'er in
[05:15] <xar0s> to test it out
[05:15] <xar0s> you dont ned to use it
[05:15] <globe> lol...welp well see how it goes ;-)
[05:15] <xar0s> tru
[05:15] <xenos76> Can someone direct me to a good page where I can customize some of Ubuntu's features?
[05:15] <krznpsk> can anyone help me getting dual monitors to work in gnome, on 2 graphics cards?
[05:15] <quantux> depends on which features Xenos
[05:16] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76: what kind of features?
[05:16] <Hooked-on-GL> yeah
[05:16] <ThePub> sandy16: sorry, walked away for a bit.  What do you mean by indexes?
[05:16] <xenos76> Well, Im trying to make it so when I click on different workspaces I will have different Icons on each one.
[05:16] <administrator__> someone pls help me
[05:16] <xenos76> So its not so messy.
[05:16] <majestik> is there an app to add users?
[05:17] <quantux> I'm not sure, I don't have any icons at all on my desktops...
[05:17] <Hooked-on-GL> I dont think you can do that, without getting really messy in the process
[05:17] <xenos76> Oh
[05:17] <xenos76> darn
[05:17] <Hooked-on-GL> i tried to change wallpaper on every workspace in XGL
[05:17] <quantux> majestik, you almost have it, it's "adduser"
[05:17] <Hooked-on-GL> that was hard enough
[05:17] <sandy16> ThePub, I think the list of packages that are available at the reposotories. Is n`t that what happens when we apt-get update?
[05:17] <beasty> morning
[05:17] <xenos76> I'm surprised that someone hasn't thought of this before me.
[05:18] <quantux> or system->administration->users and groups
[05:18] <Hooked-on-GL> probably have, just no implementation
[05:18] <Hooked-on-GL> I guess the answer is to keep things tidy
[05:18] <administrator__> can someone help me pls
[05:18] <Hooked-on-GL> all my stuff is in my home folder
[05:18] <majestik> quantux, im guessing is a gui right, cuz there is an app in cli that is useradd
[05:18] <Hooked-on-GL> and I take it out when I need it
[05:18] <ThePub> sandy16: ok, package lists.  yeah, when you update there is an index downloaded.  I think it's in /var/cache/apt too.. why would you need it?
[05:18] <xar0s> administrator_ what do you need?
[05:18] <xenos76> Yeah, well its just that I want to have a different setup as my dad without having to log onto my account to do so.
[05:19] <wolv3rin3> I need some help with Ubuntu installation
[05:19] <wolv3rin3> can someone Pm me?
[05:19] <CientificoLoco> when I type mercury on the terminal I get Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/dMSN/Main...
[05:19] <wubrgame1> hey guys
[05:19] <wubrgame1> how do i configure apt-get to use a proxy server
[05:19] <wubrgame1> (not synaptic)
[05:19] <xar0s> wubrgame1
[05:20] <xar0s> its easy
[05:20] <xar0s> really easy
[05:20] <gl0be> xar0s: well, that didnt work. Nothing happened until I got booted off the wireless (not because of the other wireless card, weak signal). But it could be because of the shotty usb ports on this ancient gateway....
[05:20] <wolv3rin3> I need some help with Ubuntu installation
[05:20] <ThePub> sandy16: maybe a better question is, what're you trying to accomplish beyond just finding a packages dependencies?
[05:20] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: do you know any good customization sites anyways?
[05:20] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Well, there is the gnome look site for wallpapers and icons etc
[05:20] <xar0s> wubrgame1: Edit your /etc/bash.bashrc file as root.
[05:20] <quantux> the gnome gui tool is users-admin
[05:21] <xar0s> add
[05:21] <wolv3rin3> can anyone help me? I am totally new in this subject
[05:21] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  http://www.gnome-look.org
[05:21] <xar0s> export http_proxy=http://10.254.60.15:3128/
[05:21] <xar0s> export ftp_proxy=http://10.254.60.15:3128/
[05:21] <TGPO> wolv3rin3, whats your question?
[05:21] <xar0s> (or whatever your proxy is)
[05:21] <lemonsCC> wlov: what do you need help with?
[05:21] <Terminus> !ask| wolv3rin3
[05:21] <ubotu> wolv3rin3: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:21] <wubrgame1> what ?
[05:21] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: naa, that is just themes and stuff. I would probably have to edit the ubuntu source code to fix my problem.
[05:22] <xar0s> globe: hmm.... so its not working on the windos box iether...
[05:22] <n3rdism> so long, champloo time!
[05:22] <wolv3rin3> I have dvd of Ubuntu 6.06 and I want to know how to install it in OEM mode
[05:22] <xar0s> globe: has that card ever worked?
[05:22] <wolv3rin3> its a live DVD
[05:22] <administrator__> lol
[05:22] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Well, i think you should get to know ubuntu a bit, then decide on these things
[05:22] <gl0be> xar0s yes, but it does work on some windows boxes. or at least it did a week ago
[05:22] <wolv3rin3> means I can boot from that
[05:23] <wolv3rin3> which can load linux
[05:23] <xar0s> globe: ok... iwconfig didnt work... now try 'ifconfig'
[05:23] <TGPO> wolv3rin3, why OEM?
[05:23] <lemonsCC> wolv3rin3: OEM mode is only available from the alternate CD
[05:23] <xar0s> globe: see what that reads out
[05:24] <wolv3rin3> cause I tried it after booting to desktiop by clicking on Install icon but then I went upo 5th step out of 6
[05:24] <wolv3rin3> and then it get hanged
[05:24] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: the most experience I have hand with Ubuntu is trying to install WINE manually.
[05:24] <wolv3rin3> at that partition step
[05:24] <sunnz2> How do I install win32codecs on 6.10?
[05:24] <gl0be> xar0s: ifconfig reads out only eth0, with no connections (its unplugged). ifconfig -a reads out eth0, sit0, lo all connectionless
[05:24] <dyzlex> Ok, who can hook me up with a link to setting up XGL/Beryl in 6.06?
[05:25] <sandy16> ThePub, i am trying to rewrite the dapper cd with the required packeages like codecs burners etc. so that would help my pals who have no internet facility
[05:25] <TGPO> sunnz2, http://www.debian-multimedia.org/pool
[05:25] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Well, get used to basic things like the console, and apt
[05:25] <sunnz2> TPGO, yes??
[05:25] <administrator__> this so cool
[05:26] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: Trust me, im very familiar with apt-get
[05:26] <TGPO> sunnz2, go to that link go to the 'w' section and download the .deb
[05:26] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Good.
[05:26] <ThePub> sandy16: maybe something like this then?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
[05:26] <sunnz2> TPGO, done.
[05:26] <wolv3rin3> any Idea why my system is getting hang durin that last partition step
[05:26] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  I just thought for a minute maybe you were new, just out from windows
[05:26] <TGPO> sunnz2, double click the .deb file
[05:26] <ThePub> sandy16: that's going in the right direction it sounds like.  you want to customize the installer.
[05:27] <xar0s> globe: do you know your essid? is you go into the network moniter, then configure, then prefs for eth0, can you enter n essid?
[05:27] <sunnz2> TGPO, I am ssh'ing
[05:27] <administrator__> hmm
[05:27] <dyzlex> !beryl
[05:27] <sunnz2> So no GUI.
[05:27] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[05:27] <sandy16> ThePub, Not the installer but .. the packages ..
[05:27] <gl0be> xar0s well, no. eth0 is the wired connection.
[05:27] <xar0s> hmm
[05:28] <dyzlex> Gah, there was a link to installing beryl specifically on 6.06, does anyone have a link?
[05:28] <TGPO> sunnz2, well then, I would suggest using links2 if your not running a GUI
[05:28] <ThePub> sandy16: you'd have to customize the installer :)  http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/
[05:28] <sunnz2> TGPO, that's a browser...
[05:28] <xar0s> my belkin reads as eth0
[05:28] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: No, I have used Ubuntu a bit but, I got rid of it due to compatibility issues with my favorite games. My dad however can't afford the luxury of owning a windows XP cd so I said "It might take a while to get used to but, look on the bright side, You'll NEVER get viruses on this computer"
[05:28] <gl0be> xar0s: I am starting to think that the dongle is dead. We think the old computer we pulled it off of took a surge and I thank that might have killed the dongle too
[05:28] <ThePub> sandy16: anyhow.. *shrug*  I'll admit, never had to do that, too spoiled with internet connections :)
[05:29] <xar0s> that very well could be it
[05:29] <xar0s> im really sorry i couldnt have been of more help
[05:29] <xar0s> :-/
[05:29] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Yeah, that stuff is an upside
[05:29] <TGPO> sunnz2, yes, you want to go to a website (port 80) not ssh (port 22?23?)
[05:29] <wolv3rin3> any idea: Terminus?
[05:29] <sunnz2> TGPO, I've download the thing.
[05:29] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  I use cedega for games :P
[05:29] <sandy16> ThePub, but how would a jigdo gonna help me?
[05:29] <gl0be> xar0s: thanks a lot for tryin! we'll be buyin a netgear methinks ;-)
[05:29] <xar0s> no
[05:29] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  WoW, COD2 etc
[05:29] <xar0s> senao is the way to go
[05:29] <xar0s> lol
[05:30] <gl0be> senao?
[05:30] <xar0s> yea
[05:30] <TGPO> sunnz2, dpkg -i w32codecs*.deb
[05:30] <gl0be> ive never heard of them
[05:30] <dyzlex> Does cedega work with steam?
[05:30] <ThePub> sandy16: read about it :)  you can customize your intallation packages.  it's just a different way of building an install iso.  just sounded like something that would be useful.
[05:30] <xar0s> they are great for linux
[05:30] <sandy16> ThePub, thats really good :)
[05:30] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: Yeah, I tryed to set up CEDEGA manually instead of buying it but, that was a mistake and with about 3 hours straight of trying to figure it out with tutorials, I gave up.
[05:31] <gl0be> xar0s: you happen to have a link?
[05:31] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: I mainly wanted to use it for WoW and steam.
[05:31] <administrator__> its old school time
[05:31] <xar0s> um
[05:31] <xar0s> google for em
[05:31] <xar0s> they pwn
[05:31] <xar0s> prism2.5
[05:31] <wolv3rin3> I need some help with Ubuntu installation
[05:31] <xar0s> senao
[05:31] <ThePub> sandy16: dunno how to build a cdrom archive, it's possible.. but like I said it's beyond me.  just trying to be helpful.  myself I'd just burn a normal install iso then dump the latest debs into another custom iso and install them seperately.
[05:31] <gl0be> xar0s cool thanks alot...i'll look into it
[05:31] <xenos76> wolv3rin3: make your question more spacific.
[05:32] <sunnz2> TGPO, ok, the codecs is installed now??? Why mplayer still refuses to play avi files?
[05:32] <administrator__> so many stuff to study
[05:32] <ThePub> sandy16: but I'm ghetto like that ;)
[05:32] <wolv3rin3> I want to know how ti install Ubuntu in OEM mode when I boot from DVD
[05:32] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Steam runs on linux anyway, does it not?
[05:32] <kitche> wolv3rin3: the desktop-dvd?
[05:32] <TGPO> wolv3rin3, you need the alternate install cd
[05:32] <sandy16> ThePub, no problem  :)
[05:33] <wolv3rin3> no I have live DVD
[05:33] <TGPO> wolv3rin3, you NEED the alternate install CD to do OEM
[05:33] <nothlit> You have to go into alternate mode?
[05:33] <kitche> wolv3rin3 yeah that's teh desktop dvd you need the alternate one
[05:33] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: I don't think it does. If it does, I have never heard of it working without CEDEGA.
[05:33] <transgress> is there a way to remove all .* files except for..?
[05:33] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: Ill look to see if it does.
[05:33] <nothlit> The dvd has both live and alternate mode guys
[05:33] <sunnz2> Anyone know if mplayer + win32codecs will play avi files?
[05:33] <transgress> sunnz2: yes
[05:33] <nothlit> transgress, move it into a safe folder lol?
[05:34] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  I would let you use my account, but that would be logged.  er... i mean.. illegal
[05:34] <nothlit> win32 is for wmv /wma files lol
[05:34] <sunnz2> transgress, but they are not working? How do I get them to work?
[05:34] <transgress> nothlit: .. is the directory above the one i'm in...
[05:34] <nothlit> mplayer will play avi files by itself
[05:34] <transgress> sunnz2: what kind of avi file?
[05:34] <transgress> xvid, divx, etc?
[05:34] <sunnz2> I don't know.. divx maybe?
[05:34] <transgress> file filename.avi
[05:34] <wolv3rin3> when I try to install from OEM mode, installation went upto 70% then my screen went black after some time when I restart my PC (before that I eject DVD) and system boot fro HDD and after booting it asks for username and pass
[05:34] <Murdock_BH> #ubuntu-br
[05:34] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: Your CEDEGA account?
[05:35] <wolv3rin3> but during installation I didnt gave any username and pass
[05:35] <sunnz2> RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 640 x 480, 23.98 fps, video: XviD, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)
[05:35] <wolv3rin3> so it never complete booting process and go to desktop
[05:35] <wolv3rin3> thats my prob
[05:35] <cygnus_> hi, how can i replace EASILY the site that ubuntu is using for getting packages
[05:35] <sunnz2> transgress, so it is xvid.
[05:35] <wolv3rin3> thats why I want to install it from OEM mode
[05:36] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Yeah
[05:36] <transgress> hey can someone help me.  i'm about to try to clear out my config files before i install fedora and i'm trying with w32codecs that should play
[05:36] <nothlit> wolv3rin3, it asks for a username and pass because its oem mode

[05:38] <nothlit> wolv3rin3, ... OEM mode is supposed to ask you for a username/password when it boots
[05:38] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: Can we get in a private convorsation?
[05:38] <nothlit> wolv3rin3, so someone can set up an account
[05:38] <nothlit> wolv3rin3, also just try the regular alternate install mode

[05:39] <worldjam> hello whats the best way to emulate 32bit on a 64bit ubuntu. im trying to install wine
[05:39] <nothlit> wolv3rin3, THE WHOLE POINT OF OEM MODE IS THAT YOU DON'T PROVIDE A PW DURING INSTALL, you add one after it boots, its for manufacturers
[05:39] <JFlash> I'm looking at postfix's  main.cf.  why 'myorigin' points to etc/mailname in ubuntu?  how to work with this sort of config?
[05:39] <lemonsCC> dyzlex sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade

[05:40] <belfegorash> hi there
[05:40] <nothlit> wolv3rin3, just put in your intended username/pw
[05:40] <belfegorash> i dld mplayer i my synaptic cant see it
[05:40] <belfegorash> pls help
[05:41] <wolv3rin3> I did it but then it say wrong/improper usename and password
[05:41] <SilentDis> hello again :)
[05:41] <nothlit> belfegorash, you don't download mplayer from somewhere else, you install it with synaptic
[05:41] <belfegorash> and how i do that ?
[05:41] <belfegorash> because in synaptic there isnt mplayer
[05:41] <belfegorash> :(
[05:41] <nothlit> wolv3rin3, you can try a net install, also make sure you really selected the right mode, and used the disk checking function

[05:42] <wolv3rin3>  thanks to all of u for help
[05:43] <wolv3rin3> :-)
[05:43] <medic30420> Baxter_Kylie, not sure exactly where it is, but i have seen some tutorials that doexactly what you are talking about
[05:43] <TGPO> worldjam, trust me if your looking to use your system as a normal system you will be taking 64 bit back out and putting 32 back in. 64 bit just isnt ready for general use yet
[05:43] <nothlit> seamus7, have you tried rm -fr ~/.azureus ?
[05:43] <xenos76> Hooked-on-GL: Hmm odd, do you want to try to communicate through msn or maybe aim?
[05:44] <worldjam> but cant you just emulate 32
[05:44] <TGPO> worldjam, not effectivly or easily
[05:44] <seamus7> nothilit: I moved /.azureus to trash
[05:44] <Hooked-on-GL> xenos76:  Sounds good.  Im a gtalk user myself, but MSN will do fine
[05:44] <xenos76> ok
[05:44] <xenos76> my msn: xenos@fishhoo.com

[05:45] <Baxter_Kylie> medic30420: Hmm. I have my own python script already written to handle the sequential backups (I'm keeping the 3 most recent) ... I just don't know where the setting specifically controlling the usb automounting are.
[05:45] <TGPO> worldjam, you can do just about anything, however even setting up wine is 64 bit is a lesson in frustration, using it is next to impossible
[05:45] <Adammk> talk about DRM and proprietary software being restrictive: I'm switching back to windows cause ubuntu doesn't have much support for my MTP music device. I should have been smarter and got a UMS player, and I regret that decision now. I will however watch Gnomad 2 and Amarok's changelogs and switch back the instant they've implemented Windows Media Player-like syncronization features to my MTP device (or when I get a new UMS player).
[05:45] <Adammk> Sorry guys it's been great and I've learned a lot more about computers than if I had continued my life on Windows, but Music is a big deal to me and I need easy tranfer and managment.
[05:45] <nothlit> seamus7, run azureus in a command line and google the errors, or download the azureus from azureus.sf.net and replace the current azureus.jar you have with theirs

[05:52] <Flannel> seamus7: use the wiki, not ubuntuguide.  And, java has a package, it does it all for you.
[05:52] <nothlit> lemonsCC, if you've disabled unnecesary services, you  can lower the timeout on grub and disable the splash, otherwise recompiling your kernel may help

[05:53] <seamus7> ubotu: so there's no real benefit of updating to update 10 yet or is that the Ubuntu package is the best choice regardless?

[06:22] <TriGz> Hey there, dont suppose anyone has a minute to help me with my mp3 codecs? i've checked ubuntu forums and website >.<
[06:22] <Borat> hey, does anyone know of a good powermanagement thing in FLUXBOX?
[06:22] <Flannel> Borat: you might try asking in #fluxbox
[06:23] <juantelez_> I found the CD!!!! thanks you very much Flannel and crimsun
[06:23] <mister_roboto> StikkitJim:  for (i=index=0, lowest=arr[i] ; i < sizeof(arr); i++) { lowest=min(arr[i] ,lowest); index=i; }
[06:24] <juantelez_> but is the 6.06 version, they are also in this version?!
[06:24] <belfegorash> when i open mplayer is an eror "new face failled why?
[06:24] <StikkitJim> thanks mister_roboto :D
[06:24] <corevette> my sound doesn't work at all
[06:24] <sushi_> How do i disable a certain package from being updated in Software Updates?
[06:24] <mister_roboto> StikkitJim: oops, index isn't gonna be right.
[06:25] <Flannel> juantelez_: yep.
[06:25] <mister_roboto> StikkitJim: but it's close. fix it :)
[06:25] <TriGz> Bah, ill just asked, ive done a sudo apt-get install totem-xine, to install MP3 codecs, but it still wont play my mp3's >.<
[06:25] <juantelez_> thanks again Flannel
[06:25] <StikkitJim> awesome.. having a go
[06:26] <ITSa341> nemish    you around?
[06:26] <juantelez_> what should i do now? I have to config an archive to install de packages whit sudo apt-get install or there is an easier way to do it?
[06:27] <lovloss> I love you guys :D
[06:27] <sushi_> juantelez: when you use apt-get install, it will download, install, and configure for you.
[06:27] <sushi_> in most cases*
[06:27] <Flannel> juantelez_: you'll need to use apt-cdrom to add the CD as a repository
[06:27] <lovloss> apt-get install is my friend. but i make the mistake of downloading all the suggested programs c.c
[06:28] <Manstein> somebody around that knows how to backup a boot partition?
[06:28] <sushi_> Does anybody know how to disable a package from the software updates list?
[06:28] <juantelez_> Flannel so, i hace to make "sudo apt-cdrom install gcc"?
[06:28] <juantelez_> *have
[06:28] <Flannel> juantelez_: no, apt-cdrom will add the CD into your apt repository, then you use the normal apt-get
[06:29] <sushi_> Manstein: What boot partition.  It usually lies on the first part of the disk which has the boot flag on.
[06:29] <Manstein> I'm running a SATA RAID 0 Setup, which boots from an old 2gb disk (just grub and the /boot partition, the ext2 volume on the boot disk is just 250 MB, just for the boot process.
[06:29] <juantelez_> Flannel thanks, and what file did I need to configure to add apt-cdrom ?
[06:29] <Manstein> the harddisk is making "funny" noises, i want to replace it
[06:30] <sushi_> Manstein: grub loader is installed on that 2gb disk then, in the only partition.
[06:30] <majestik> what system is better, ubuntu or debian
[06:30] <Flannel> juantelez_: you don't.  just use "sudo apt-cdrom add"
[06:30] <sushi_> juantelez: /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:30] <lovloss> ubuntu!!!!!!
[06:30] <sushi_> i love ubuntu
[06:30] <belfegorash> maybe the font path is wrong..please supply.....what sould i do ?the mplayer is not working plssss
[06:30] <Manstein> i tried to use ghost in order to back them up, but since some information is'nt retrievable........
[06:30] <corevette> anyone know why my sound won't work?
[06:30] <Flannel> !sound | corevette
[06:30] <lovloss> majestik    Debian is ubuntu - working
[06:30] <ubotu> corevette: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[06:30] <juantelez_> thanks you very much sushi_!!
[06:31] <Manstein> is there a way to create another boot disk?
[06:31] <ITSa341> Manstein   go look around linux.org   there is a live linux cd for disk and partition backups   can't remember the name but it is comparable to Partition Magic
[06:31] <Flannel> majestik: they're different.  Simple as that.  "better" depends on what you're looking for, and even then, theres almost always ambiguity
[06:31] <Manstein> Ok will do guys
[06:31] <Manstein> tnx :D
[06:31] <ITSa341> Manstein   you can use it to backup the partition and or copy it to another disk
[06:31] <StikkitJim> mister_roboto : is the min function in a weird header?
[06:31] <sushi_> How to make a boot cd: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-19428.html
[06:31] <belfegorash> error..maybe the font path is wrong..please supply.....what sould i do ?the mplayer is not working plssss
[06:32] <Manstein> Mmmz ITSa341, Ghost couldn't do it, but i will try to find the distro u were mentioning
[06:32] <Manstein> tnx
[06:32] <sushi_> really good guide there
[06:32] <Flannel> StikkitJim: you might try asking in ##C
[06:32] <lovloss> Ubuntu was made by a rich guy for the sake of poor kids in south africa who cant afford microsoft. =)  Its extremely simple compared to other flavors and just generally stable
[06:32] <StikkitJim> thank you Flannel
[06:33] <ITSa341> Manstein it runs on linux and is designed for exactly what you are doing....in linux
[06:33] <Manstein> without reboot that is :D?
[06:33] <majestik> Flannel, yeah its ambiguous, you just cant decide which distribution, its kind of choices of destiny
[06:33] <mister_roboto> StikkitJim: well... fmin is.  just use the '<' operator and be done with it. you need to stash the value of the lowest index anyway
[06:33] <sushi_> lovloss well said
[06:33] <Flannel> majestik: best thing to do is try a few out, and see what you like
[06:33] <sushi_> i love ubuntu
[06:33] <Manstein> ITSa341, ill try to find the distro on www.linux.org
[06:34] <ITSa341> cool
[06:34] <ITSa341> that is where I found it I think
[06:34] <mister_roboto> StikkitJim: something like "if (arr[i]  < lowest) { lowest=arr[i] ; index=i; }"    is this your homework or something?  you don't seem to know anything
[06:34] <lovloss> For moral reasons alone I would stick to this prorgam. I have a very high level respect for the ideals behind it. And it really works for me - every mistake i have ever made is third-party involved
[06:34] <Manstein> tnx :D
[06:34] <ITSa341> I used it to clone a raid array and a boot partition as you are working with a couple years ago
[06:34] <Manstein> ok
[06:34] <varsendaggr> how do i start gstreamer from the command line
[06:35] <sushi_> Ubuntu Works really well for me too, and I have tried many distros
=== _greenie_ is now known as _greenie
[06:35] <Manstein> One more question. I am using Linux software raid. If anything happens to my boot HDD, will i be able to retrieve the data from the raid 0 array?
[06:35] <lovloss> One last reason to use Ubuntu: Best. Community. Ever.
[06:36] <lovloss> ;D
[06:36] <mister_roboto> lovloss: i agree. the community is fantastic
[06:36] <metta> good docs, good people
=== metta is now known as ubun
[06:36] <lovloss> yep. I keep this chat room at the top of the screen in a quick link.
[06:36] <ITSa341> Manstein   I would be careful until you nackup the 2bg drive and have the replacement installed and booting
[06:37] <ITSa341> Backup*\
[06:37] <ubun> this channel has been more useful to me than ubuntuforums anyway
[06:37] <Manstein> yeah, get it ITSa341
[06:37] <ubun> but probably because i only ask super hard questions on there that can't be answered in here in 5 seconds
[06:37] <Manstein> well ok i'm on my way then, ill give it some shots :D
[06:37] <ITSa341> Manstein  I would also recommend replaceing it SOON
[06:38] <Manstein> Yups, that's why im still up, was about to go to sleep, just when i was finishing my downloads, the 2gb started to crackle :D
[06:38] <ITSa341> Manstein  Bummer, I lost a 250GB in my xbox last week
[06:38] <econobeing> if i can just get alsa sound working, i'd be set
[06:38] <Manstein> some things just can't wait
[06:39] <Manstein> Mmz, i lost a 120 GB in my mediapc as well
[06:39] <Manstein> sucks
[06:39] <sushi_> arent there ways of detecting before your hdd is about to break?
[06:39] <sushi_> like a software solution
[06:39] <Manstein> nah , just make sure u have backups
[06:39] <slop> how do i get a second hard disk to automatically mount in a folder i created called /storage ?
[06:39] <ITSa341> it's ok I'll have more room with another 500 in the xbox,  with 3 500gb drives I can fit a ton of games movies and Linux
[06:40] <dojozo> hello everyone. I am in the market to buy a wireless card for a desktop with ubuntu. What should I be looking for on newegg?
[06:40] <ITSa341> When will Ubuntu work on the xbox  :-)
[06:40] <Manstein> Nice to have so much HDD space
[06:40] <Manstein> comes in quite handy
[06:40] <ITSa341> yup
[06:40] <ITSa341> no more looking for the dvd in one of 4 closets
[06:41] <Manstein> yups :D
=== dojozo is now known as globe
[06:41] <Manstein> that's my perspective as well
[06:41] <Manstein> who needs dvd's :D?
[06:41] <ITSa341> I use each dvd ONE time
[06:41] <ITSa341> hehe
[06:41] <sushi_> slop at the end of /etc/fstab  put something like /dev/hda2 /storage ext2 auto 0 0       if it is formatted as ext2 and if the device is hda2..etc
[06:42] <slop> sushi_, how can i check that it's ext2?
[06:42] <sushi_> dojozo : my intel proset wireless works great    shrug
[06:43] <Manstein> @slop, just check disk management?
[06:43] <sushi_> slop: it will tell u when you do a sudo mount -a    (-a means to mount what is in the fstab)
[06:43] <sushi_> ive never had to use the gui solution =\
[06:43] <ITSa341> dojozo   I have had good luck with Broadcom cards, they sometimes take a little tweaking or ndiswrapper but I get great signal and rock solid stable connection
[06:44] <slop> sushi_, that did it, thanks :)
[06:44] <sushi_> yey
[06:44] <globe> ITSa341 thx (nickchange)
[06:44] <slop> now if i could just get sound working in flash 9...
[06:45] <econobeing> okay, okay, one last time: "beryl-???" (so sorry ._.)
[06:45] <ITSa341> dojozo   there are hardware compatibility lists on the net and I think Linspire still has one easy to find at their site. Before buying look up the card you are looking at there and make sure it is listed
[06:45] <econobeing> i got the text editor open ready for it this time
[06:45] <sushi_> anyone get beryl to work with fglrx?
[06:46] <ITSa341> hehe  beryl is cool
[06:46] <econobeing> beryl-manager, that's it
[06:46] <sushi_> ITSa341 u must use nvidia
[06:46] <ITSa341> sushi   I have nVidia, Intel, ATI and many more    I have run xgl on the nVidia and the ATI

[06:55] <sc4ttrbrain> its ok :D
[06:56] <cha0t1c> hello
[06:57] <cha0t1c> does anyone know how to adjust the refresh rate, I tried all methods but they still wont work when I'm logging in, I have 19" lcd lg, refresh rate 75 Hz 1280*1024
[06:58] <nothlit> Annirak, ps -e | grep commandname
[06:58] <poh> oh shoot me
[06:58] <Manstein> ITSa341, I'm trying the "dd" program. Since it's my first time using "dd" and I don't know what I'm doing, any comments will be appreciated :D.
[06:59] <ITSa341> dd?
[06:59] <Manstein> ITSa341, I'm trying the "dd" program. Since it's my first time using "dd" and I don't know what I'm doing, any comments will be appreciated :D.
[06:59] <Manstein> I'm planning on running the command whilst running from a live cd. Will this work : dd -noerror if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb
[06:59] <phu_> hey, guy, how can I mirror all debian packages on debian website
[06:59] <itsmabus> ITSa341: some sort of data recovery program afaik
[06:59] <cha0t1c> also installing plugins for firefox is a drag, any easier way,
[07:00] <Manstein> just ran across it, dunno if it's any good
[07:00] <phu_> i want to key a local copy of all debian packages for just CPU architecture: i386 and mipsel
[07:00] <Seveas> Manstein, it'll be slow
[07:00] <Manstein> its 250 MB
[07:00] <sportsFan> heck, i'd just like to have access to my drive, i can while in live cd mode, but once in the actual OS, the drives won't mount.
[07:00] <Manstein> only my boot hdd
[07:00] <Seveas> Manstein, and it'll only work if the disks are the  same size
[07:00] <cha0t1c> specially the flash player, it keeps failing, incompatibility with X86_64 bit
[07:00] <ITSa341> Manstein    asking the wrong person, I can't remember the name of the live linux disk utilities I found but they were graphical like Partition Magic and was idiot proof
[07:01] <Seveas> Manstein, to speed it up, add bs=1024 to the command
[07:01] <sportsFan> my ssh incoming doesn't work, do i have to start it first ?
[07:01] <ITSa341> Manstein   Seveas is the one to listen to, saved my butt a few times in here !!   :-)
[07:02] <Manstein> well ok then
[07:02] <Manstein> dd --noerror if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb bs=1024
[07:02] <Seveas> sportsFan, by default the ssh daemon is not installed
[07:02] <Manstein> that should do the trick from live cd
[07:02] <sportsFan> i did the apt-get install ssh
[07:02] <Manstein> ?
[07:02] <sportsFan> how do i start it ?
[07:02] <Seveas> sportsFan, it should be started then, try this: sudo netstat -tlpn
[07:02] <Seveas> and paste the output on the pastebin
[07:02] <Seveas> Manstein, yes
[07:03] <sportsFan> different computer
[07:03] <sportsFan> trying to get it up before killing this one
[07:03] <Seveas> heh ok
[07:03] <cmt^^> Good*
[07:03] <Manstein> Seveas, as for the size problem, i have another disk of the same size, its another brand though. Will this matter?
[07:03] <Seveas> sportsFan, then to make sure it has started: sudo invoke-rc.d ssh start
[07:03] <Seveas> Manstein, no
[07:04] <Manstein> Seveas, tnx
[07:04] <Manstein> :D
[07:04] <Manstein> will give it a try, will be back when done thanking u guys :D
[07:04] <sportsFan> all i show is something called port map
[07:05] <cmt^^> Good morning ladies and gents!
[07:05] <sportsFan> nope, still connection refused
[07:05] <nothlit> sportsFan, sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
[07:05] <ITSa341> ladies and gents   Uh oh   I feel out of place now
[07:05] <belfegorash> i must instal codecs ..or the mplayer have codes in it
[07:05] <belfegorash> ?
[07:06] <belfegorash> codecs*
[07:06] <nothlit> mplayer has most codecs already
[07:06] <nothlit> vlc has more built in though
[07:06] <belfegorash> yes but when i open it ..it gives a eror
[07:06] <belfegorash> new face failed
[07:06] <Seveas> !codecs | belfegorash

[07:07] <sportsFan>  <nothlit>  : that worked ! thank you so much
[07:07] <belfegorash> so i must have some codecs right?
[07:07] <sportsFan> btw, VLC contains 99% of the codecs for most movies no days
[07:07] <sportsFan> now*
[07:07] <belfegorash> so i will instal vlc
[07:07] <ITSa341> Does vlc do encrypted dvds?
[07:07] <sportsFan> vlc is the bomb
[07:07] <belfegorash> thank you
[07:08] <nothlit> belfegorash, depends what you are trying to play
[07:08] <belfegorash> prison break:D
[07:08] <belfegorash> avi
=== sjr_ is now known as SJr|nx
[07:08] <nothlit> mplayer should be able to handle tha

[07:09] <belfegorash> must instal gmplayer?
[07:09] <nothlit> no
[07:09] <nothlit> thats included with mplayer
[07:09] <slop> how do i get firefox to always use the mozilla-mplayer plugin instead of the totem plugin to play movies?
[07:10] <belfegorash> i install with synaptic and all was ok ..except with the error
[07:10] <nothlit> slop, you need to remove the totem mozilla plugin through synaptic/apt-get, then restart firefox
[07:10] <slop> nothlit, ok thanks :)
[07:11] <slop> nothlit, you're talking about the package called totem-mozilla, right?
[07:11] <cha0t1c> ok the refresh rate thingy kills my monitor when i start my comp, then i restart the monitor and it works fine, but the refresh rate is so slow that it actually ghosts sometimes, I adjusted Xorg, but nothing happenned
[07:12] <nothlit> slop, um if thats the name, if it isnt go search for packages named totem and look through that

[07:18] <cha0t1c> if u have windows, attch it use windows to reformat
[07:19] <hubag_ni_ate> western digital crash very often
[07:19] <Cyber> nah ch0tic thats a mission adn a half :/ i would prefer to just format it from linix, i got a terminal open infront of me
[07:19] <stubblechin> i have a server with dapper on it, raid1 setup with three scsi drives and the ext3 filesystem. i want to resize one of the partitions so i can create a partition for lvm, and i have no way of being physically present in front of the machine so i have to do it with the server running. what do i do?
[07:19] <ITSa341> first one I've ever had fail
[07:19] <cha0t1c> I ahven't had a crash and i'm running 2 raptors and a barracuda
[07:19] <hubag_ni_ate> WD is not a good choice
[07:20] <Manstein> ITSa341, my 2gb is a WD as well :D
[07:20] <ITSa341> only drives I've ever had any bad luck with really was MDT
[07:20] <Manstein> well, i haven't had MUCH problems with WDC
[07:20] <ITSa341> 30% failure rate last year on the MDT drives in our shop and we do use a lot of drives
[07:20] <cpk1> stubblechin: unmount the drive you are partitioning?
[07:20] <Manstein> MDT?
[07:20] <Cyber> ok guys how would i format the HD from linux, there is a terminal open in front of me i just need the syn
[07:20] <Cyber> =D
[07:21] <hubag_ni_ate> better get a SEAGATE or MAXTOR or SAMSUNG
[07:21] <stubblechin> cpk1: the partitions i have are /, /home, and /boot. i'm afraid to unmount any of them with the server running
[07:21] <ITSa341> Magnetic Data Technologies I think.
=== sarimanok is now known as notMe
[07:21] <Manstein> ok, they make HDD's :S. Never knew
[07:21] <grndslm> SEAGATE!!!!!!!
[07:21] <deusjevoo> no Maxtor
[07:21] <deusjevoo> maxtor has sata problems
[07:21] <Cyber> ok guys how would i format the HD from linux, there is a terminal open in front of me i just need the syntax
[07:22] <hubag_ni_ate> no WESTERN digital
[07:22] <cpk1> doesnt seagate own maxtor?
=== notMe is now known as marcjoe
[07:22] <Manstein> Cyber, i think it's something like mke2fs -j /dev/hdx1
[07:22] <jair> hey guys there is a rar application gnu for debian to work with .rar cpmpressed systems?
[07:22] <Manstein> but then again, i'm just new to linux
[07:22] <deusjevoo> yes, seagate does own them
[07:22] <cha0t1c> ok Cyber, try to reformat away from linux if it failed so many times
[07:22] <hubag_ni_ate> whos info was that
[07:22] <Manstein> Cyber, Ull probably have to sudo that
[07:23] <Cyber> cha0tic it was just the installer that crashed, half way through installing the system, it formated tho
[07:23] <Cyber> i need the correct syn :P
[07:23] <ITSa341> Cyber   try burning the install disk at 2x or 4x and try again
[07:23] <stubblechin> is there a irc room for ubuntu server, or is this pretty much it?
[07:23] <cha0t1c> oh that's excellent i thought the installer might have been corrupeted
[07:23] <cpk1> stubblechin: are they all on the same physical drive? my / and /home are on 2 different drives so i can unmount home relatively easy/not so dangerously
[07:23] <Manstein> Hey, the Ubuntu disks feature an option " check cd integrety" or something like that
[07:24] <Manstein> ever tried that cyber?
[07:24] <cha0t1c> yup u shud use that
[07:24] <ITSa341> Manstein   good call
[07:24] <Manstein> its one of the boot options of the live cd
[07:24] <Cyber> nah the installer crashes half way through because of a currupt file system, i have checked the CD
[07:24] <cha0t1c> yup
[07:24] <stubblechin> cpk1: i have raid1, so i think all three of them are spread over all three of my drives
[07:24] <Cyber> nothing wrong with it
[07:24] <stubblechin> software raid1
[07:24] <Cyber> i got this CD from buntu :P
[07:24] <Cyber> they sent it to me
[07:24] <Manstein> mm have u tried another cdrom/dvdrom DRIVE ? just for the sake of it?
[07:24] <ITSa341> ahh cool

[07:25] <Cyber> manstein ive installed from that drive onto a virtual machine
[07:25] <stubblechin> cpk1: sorry, there are only two drives. sda and sdb. three partitions
[07:25] <Cyber> !format
[07:25] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[07:25] <cha0t1c> i'm also new to ubuntu and this screen issue is killing me
[07:25] <Cyber> ...!
[07:25] <ITSa341> Cyber are you doing the partitioning manually or letting it do the recommended ?
[07:25] <Cyber> its ive tried both methods :/
[07:25] <Cyber> both crash
[07:25] <Cyber> its the file system for some reason
[07:25] <ITSa341> hmm wierd
[07:25] <kugmuntu> nyay
[07:26] <Cyber> gonna check the manual on mkfs now
[07:26] <Manstein> Are there any raid volumes present in the System Cyber?

[07:37] <gharz> Manstein, and now i can't remember which is which

[07:38] <Manstein> i GUESS

[07:39] <varsendaggr> i need to get a fps like ut   how should i install it?
[07:39] <gharz> Manstein, uhmmm... thanks. i'll try to search which source is it.

[07:40] <dbcalo> does anyone her know much about cedega on edgy?
[07:40] <dbcalo> hard locks the system when i run it.
[07:40] <Manstein> which game are u trying to emulate?
[07:40] <dbcalo> haven't got to games yet. cedega itself hard locks the system.
[07:41] <nothlit> dbcalo #cedega
[07:41] <dbcalo> been there, trying to broaden my search.
[07:41] <Manstein> dbcalo, i'm running WoW on Wine, no problems

[07:42] <Manstein> i had that but only in D3D mode
[07:42] <dbcalo> ahh
[07:42] <Cas> I think my apt db is borked, is there a way to regenerate everything (e.g. by deleting /var/cache/apt) ?currently all the apt* programs give me a segfault
[07:42] <dbcalo> latest version of wine?
[07:42] <Pie-rate> This is really, really, really, really, weird. It has to be a bug. When I move my (totally working) WoW launcher from the desktop to the panel, it stops working.
[07:43] <Manstein> latest is 0.9.9 ?
[07:43] <Manstein> i'm using 0.9.26
[07:43] <Pie-rate> when i make a new launcher on the panel, it doesn't work
[07:43] <stalefries> Pie-rate: does your launcher use a relative path to the executable?
[07:43] <Pie-rate> when i make a shell script that cds to the WoW directory and runs it, it doesn't work.
[07:43] <Pie-rate> stalefries: no
[07:43] <Manstein> Pie-rate are u using cedega of wine?

[07:47] <nothlit> theres xmms, exaile, banshee, muine, quodlibet, and listen as well
[07:47] <Manstein> which one do u guys use btw :D
[07:47] <Pie-rate> nothlit, moving it to /usr/bin worked

[07:48] <varsendaggr> i like mplayer
[07:48] <varsendaggr> and xmms
[07:48] <stalefries> Pie-rate: it's suggested you put it in /usr/local/bin, to follow conventions
[07:49] <Pie-rate> stalefries: done
[07:49] <Pie-rate> what conventions are these anyway?
[07:49] <stalefries> Pie-rate: good. That's the "conventional" place for users' hand-installed binaries
[07:50] <stalefries> Pie-rate: basically, if you use nautilus to install it, put it there :)
[07:50] <nothlit> Pie-rate, local is for anything specific to that computer
[07:50] <dope> is there any major difference between kubuntu and ubuntu besides gnome/kde?
[07:50] <nothlit> Pie-rate, rather than a system wide thing
[07:50] <Pie-rate> dope: no
[07:50] <dope> :O
[07:51] <stalefries> dope: not really, some gnome/kde specific apps perhaps
[07:51] <Pie-rate> you can turn ubuntu into kubuntu by typing sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop

[07:51] <Manstein> What do u guys advice, gnome / kde ?
[07:51] <dope> i think gnome?
[07:51] <stalefries> Manstein: don't start that flamewar, please :). But I use gnome
[07:51] <dope> so should new people use ubuntu rather than kubuntu/xubuntu?
[07:52] <varsendaggr> Manstein, what do you like   simple or complex?
[07:52] <stalefries> dope: it's your choice, ubuntu is by far the most used (and hence most supported by the community), but that may be because of fame more than choice
[07:52] <dope> ah, ok cool
[07:52] <dope> bbl
[07:53] <Pie-rate> Manstein: do you like icons that wont stop annoying you with their stupid bouncing? KDE is for you :) (please don't kill me everyone :()
[07:53] <varsendaggr> Manstein, use them both and then make a choice.....    use fluxbox a little to
[07:53] <dbcalo> ok, so i think my problem is that my custom kernel is busted. the only reason i compiled is becuase i couldn't get the lastest nv drivers to build a kernel module for the common kernel.
[07:53] <isaac_>  I tried to install mysql, and i can't put the password, and it response an error
[07:53] <Manstein> no flame intended, gnome is just my first installation, never used kde before

[07:53] <stalefries> Manstein: right, but you know how these things end up :)
[07:53] <Manstein> yups, i ought to know better :/
[07:54] <Manstein> what have i done :D?
[07:54] <varsendaggr> use kde but leave before it makes you too hard.  use gnome but leave before it makes you too soft and use sunscreen

[08:01] <Cyber> heh, would have been nice to have been told that earlyer :P!
[08:02] <edbe> let me start from the services first
[08:02] <Cyber> do you think the hard drive is busted tho? i can see it in linux tho, windows doesnt pick up the drive
[08:02] <edbe> stopping some unnecessary daemons
[08:02] <nothlit> Cyber, probably not
[08:03] <Cyber> just a windows issues
[08:03] <Cyber> issue*
[08:03] <nothlit> A formatting /partition/filesystem issue
[08:04] <Cyber> ok cool
[08:04] <Cyber> let me restart using the live CD & format it using gparted
[08:05] <Cyber> altho nothlit i did use sudo mkfs /dev/hda1
[08:05] <Cyber> wouldnt that format it?
[08:05] <vonguard> hello
[08:05] <SeyToN> hi
[08:05] <vonguard> so, ok
[08:05] <vonguard> i have had a wireless problem for weeks
[08:06] <vonguard> my card will not disassociate with my home network
[08:06] <SeyToN> did u use ndiswrapper or madwifi?
[08:06] <vonguard> in public, it sees nothing, and only has my home network available
[08:06] <vonguard> neither, my card just worked, before
[08:06] <vonguard> it's intel onboard
[08:06] <dsdg> helo, silly question but how do i get a service like ssh to start up automatically when the pc boots in dapper?
[08:07] <vonguard> dsdg: services control panelo in administration menu under system menu
[08:07] <SeyToN> did u configured samba?
[08:07] <dsdg> vonguard, im in with ssh...
[08:07] <dsdg> how do i do this in the shell?
[08:07] <vonguard> oh, then it's a config and an init.d thingie, i bet
[08:07] <vonguard> samba?
[08:08] <Catshrimp> dsdg: are you using openssh-server?
[08:08] <SeyToN> !samba
[08:08] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[08:08] <vonguard> i think yeah
[08:08] <vonguard> i do have samba running
[08:08] <Catshrimp> dsdg: because I think upon installation it will start automatically.
[08:08] <vonguard> would samba mess with my wireless preferences?
[08:08] <Catshrimp> dsdg: it's at least placed in init.d upon install
[08:08] <paguilera> Hello
[08:09] <vonguard> hello paguilera
[08:09] <SeyToN> whats the issue driver or connection?
[08:09] <paguilera> Hi vonguard.
[08:09] <dsdg> Catshrimp, yes it starts automattically but i want to know where to enable disable startup services,
[08:09] <vonguard> where can i delete my network prefernces?
[08:10] <vonguard> dsdg: init.d
[08:10] <Catshrimp> dsdg: one of the rc's
[08:10] <vonguard> what is that, /var?
[08:10] <vonguard> or /root?
[08:10] <noodles12> how do i fix this problem when compiling in kdevelop for c++
[08:10] <noodles12> "configure: error: cannot run C++ compiled programs.
[08:10] <noodles12> If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.
[08:10] <noodles12> "
[08:10] <paguilera> Any ideas as to what I can do to see what's causing firefox to segfault each time I try to start it?
[08:11] <dbcalo> i cant get the nvidia module to compile or load. any tips?
[08:11] <vonguard> noodles12: check yer compile options
[08:11] <SeyToN> vonguard: have a look to this site
[08:11] <SeyToN> https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/configuring-samba.html
[08:11] <noiesmo> paguilera, did it start after you add a new plugin or flash ??
[08:11] <dsdg> Catshrimp, i see the rc.0 rc.1 and files in them, hmm, with gentoo i cant do rc-update add sshd <runlevel>
[08:11] <paguilera> I had tried adding Java plugin earlier this evening, but when it didn't work, I used synaptic to uninstall.
[08:12] <cmt^^> !irssi
[08:12] <ubotu> irssi is a command line interface IRC client ( "sudo apt-get install irssi" without the quotes to try it out )
[08:12] <paguilera> and it had seemed to be working ok.
[08:12] <paguilera> But just a few minutes ago, it crashed as I was browsing multiple sites.
[08:12] <dope> herro
[08:12] <Catshrimp> dsdg: it's the same sort of thing.  rc1.d seems to contain the ssh startup script
[08:12] <vonguard> SeyToN: thanks, but my issue is with wireless card strangeness...
[08:12] <vonguard> not really a samba problem
[08:12] <dope> so i was playing with something and now my login screen comes up but the little ubuntu bar that's supposed to come up right after it and shows stuff being loaded doesn't come up.  what did i do?
[08:12] <vonguard> unless there is some conflict possible that i am unaware of
[08:12] <dope> and i can't get to my desktop
[08:13] <thevenin> why would ubuntu dapper drake server freeze everytime i do this http://pastebin.ca/271481 and require a reboot
[08:13] <noiesmo> paguilera, not sure then sorry have had firefox crash aftr adding extensions or plugin's and removing them has fix the issue
[08:13] <vonguard> dope: perhaps you didled yer graphic card options?
[08:13] <dope> i installed beryl
[08:13] <dope> i think that's what it was
[08:13] <SeyToN> i guess thats a technical problem...
[08:13] <Hooked-on-GL> <3 beryl
[08:13] <vonguard> yeah
[08:13] <dope> and it wasn't workin so i removed and now i'm still screwed
[08:13] <vonguard> it's beryl
[08:13] <paguilera> noiesmo: It actually took me a couple tries to get Java out.  I'm wondering if maybe I didn't get it all the way removed.
[08:13] <michael__> Quick question... I hope... My university uses something called Air Projector that installs to C:\Program Files\komatsu\AirProjector Client.exe - is there any equivalent of this in Linux?
[08:13] <vonguard> check the beryl install sites out there
[08:14] <vonguard> digg had a bunch
[08:14] <dope> i can't get to my desktop :/

=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[08:14] <vonguard> sudo apt-get install links
[08:14] <vonguard> or lynx
[08:14] <vonguard> whichever one is in synaptic
[08:14] <vonguard> it's a text-based web browser
[08:14] <paguilera> links is in synaptic
[08:14] <dope> oh

[08:14] <vonguard> so, install links, then head to google
[08:15] <dope> i've had nothing but problems trying to get beryl or compiz to work

[08:16] <noiesmo> paguilera, you could always move your ~/.mozilla directory then when you start firefox it will be recreated if firefox works ok then a file in your profiles .mozilla folder is causeing the problem
[08:16] <vonguard> what a pile
[08:16] <vonguard> everytime i've tried it, it goes sideways
[08:16] <vonguard> automatix works great for me

[08:22] <lovloss> beryl's quiet... how do you make it so that when you load beryl it doesnt erase that bar along the top of each window - close, maximize, minimize , etc
[08:23] <cybermad> i can not find Epson LX-300 too... it really worst! :P
[08:23] <Geoffrey2> cybermad, is that a printer with a parallel printer cable?
[08:23] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : java fun ness, is assured
[08:23] <vonguard> one sec
[08:23] <cybermad> Geoffrey2 yes
[08:23] <[Ag0ny] > I'm trying to get eclipse to work, and gcj just doesn't cut it, so I need to pull the association from it and use sun's jre instead
[08:23] <[Ag0ny] > thanks
[08:23] <lovloss> its some sort of string you add to xorg
[08:24] <vonguard> hrmmm
[08:24] <cybermad> Geoffrey2 i want test install the LQ-1170, then LX-300.. ok.. we're discuss the 1st problem LQ-1170
[08:24] <vonguard> ok, [Ag0ny] : uninstall eclipse
[08:24] <dope> that didn't do it
[08:24] <[Ag0ny] > done
[08:24] <vonguard> install jdk from synaptic
[08:24] <[Ag0ny] > I installed in manually
[08:24] <vonguard> is gcj in synaptic?
[08:24] <dope> man i'm so screwed
[08:24] <cybermad> but i already add LaserJet 1100 from HP and it works..
[08:24] <vonguard> dope: yer gonna be ok
[08:24] <vonguard> just breath
[08:24] <[Ag0ny] > I can't find any jre or jdk in synaptic
[08:24] <dope> heh
[08:25] <dope> so what do i do now? :(
[08:25] <vonguard> dope: sudo apt-get install links
[08:25] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : it's in there
[08:25] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : sun made a big stink about putting it in there
[08:25] <nothlit> lovloss, no, that means emerald isn't working properly
[08:25] <paguilera> I believe it's listed under Sun in the S section instead of by itself.
[08:25] <dope> i think beryl fubared my system
[08:26] <vonguard> dope: yer data is still there
[08:26] <vonguard> are you on that box now, dope?
[08:26] <noiesmo> paguilera, is firefox installed thru synaptic
[08:26] <dope> i know but my desktop isn't
[08:26] <dope> yea
[08:26] <vonguard> ok
[08:26] <dope> i'm using the ctrl alt f1 etc keys
[08:26] <vonguard> we just need to get beryl off there
[08:26] <vonguard> you got gnome or kde installed?
[08:26] <dope> gnome
[08:26] <dope> ubuntu
[08:26] <paguilera> noiesmo: Should be.  It's from the basic install.
[08:26] <vonguard> ok, if kde is installed, we could load into that
[08:26] <paguilera> noiesmo: I'll double check now, though.
[08:26] <vonguard> go vi that x11.conf
[08:26] <vonguard> figure out where it says gnome
[08:27] <vonguard> change it to kde
[08:27] <vonguard> right guys?
[08:27] <vonguard> anyone wanna help me out here?
[08:27] <dope> i do
[08:27] <vonguard> i so shouldn't be the one giving out all this tech support
[08:27] <noiesmo> paguilera, you could try sudo apt-get remove --purge mozilla-firefox && sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox that will cause it to be removed and all config files should be purged then it will be reinstalled
[08:28] <vonguard> dope: you get links installed yet?
[08:28] <dope> i think
[08:28] <noiesmo> vonguard, what do you want to do login to kde instead of gnome
[08:28] <nothlit> noiesmo, lol that will break ubuntu-desktop
[08:28] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : the synaptic pkackage is called sun-java-jdk
[08:29] <nothlit> vonguard, elinks/links2/w3m > links
[08:29] <vonguard> noiesmo: dope has installed beryl, and it's gone sideways on him
[08:29] <vonguard> dope cannot log into gnome now. x11 eats it after login
[08:29] <vonguard> i figure kde might work
[08:29] <dope> my login screen comes up
[08:29] <[Ag0ny] > maybe a repository problem? I can't find any jdk or jre package and I have all the multiverse/universe repositories enabeled
[08:29] <paguilera> ok.  What should I be doing then?  If that breaks Ubuntu, it's something I definitely do not want to do.
[08:29] <vonguard> nothlit: i agree
[08:29] <dope> but when i login it's just the background color and a mouse
[08:30] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : go to the section where packages begin with S
[08:30] <Catshrimp> Hm, okay guys, xserver is install, xdm is install.  xorg has been configured as to my current hardware settings.  when I run sudo xdm, I get a blank screen and am then returned to the command prompt.  I checked /var/log/xdm.log and it says "error opening security policy file /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy"
[08:30] <Catshrimp> Anyone have any idea?
[08:30] <vonguard> sun-java5-jdk
[08:30] <vonguard> that's the name of the package
[08:30] <Geoffrey2> cybermad, ah, here we go....if LQ-1170 is not available, EPSON reccomends the LQ-850 as the next best choice, and that IS supported by CUPS, so install that one and see how it works
[08:31] <lovloss> seriously guys. when i load beryl the window at the top bar goes away. always had. I just have to add some obscure command line to xorg.conf
[08:31] <[Ag0ny] > vonguard: I see sunclock and sunclock-maps only
[08:31] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : are you on Edgy?
[08:31] <[Ag0ny] > yes, using kde

[08:32] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : i dunno what to tell you. i see it in my list, and i have multi and uni only
[08:32] <[Ag0ny] > so I have adept instead of synaptic
[08:32] <vonguard> same repositories
[08:32] <cybermad> Geoffrey2 actually right now i tried install Omni package
[08:32] <paguilera> [Ag0ny] : I see it fine on my side.  Are you looking below sunclock?
[08:32] <lovloss> the guys in #beryl are being stupid
[08:32] <necrodrako> whats a good program for clearing temp files

[08:33] <nothlit> [Ag0ny] , what about multiverse
[08:34] <[Ag0ny] > sudo apt-cache search sun-java-jdk yeilds nothing as well
[08:34] <vonguard> yeah, install multi!
[08:34] <nothlit> noiesmo, yeah but if you tell people to break the -desktop metapackages you have to tell them to reinstall them
[08:34] <Geoffrey2> cybermad, I checked Epson's website, downloaded the Product Information Guide for the EPSON LQ-1170....they give a list of printers in order of preference if your particular model is not supported....back in the days of DOS and Windows 3.1, that was a very real possibility
[08:34] <vonguard> enable multiverse
[08:34] <nothlit> noiesmo, otherwise upgrades won't work well
[08:34] <dope> i'm still screwed
[08:35] <dope> ok brb
[08:35] <[Ag0ny] > that's what I meant by backports, sorry
[08:35] <noiesmo> nothlit, good point I did reinstall kubuntu-desktop when I upgraded from dapper to edgy :) then removed it lol
[08:35] <vonguard> i agree
[08:36] <Pie-rate> I want to run a game server, i want it to start when i start my computer, and i want it to automatically restart if/when it crashes. how would i write a script (or several scripts) to do these things?
[08:37] <nothlit> !offtopic | Pie-rate
[08:37] <ubotu> Pie-rate: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[08:37] <sushi_> what sort command could i use to sort the passwd file by UID?
[08:38] <vonguard> Pie-rate: diddle init.d
[08:38] <Geoffrey2> I presume the next Ubuntu release would be 7.xx?
[08:38] <vonguard> sushi_: perhaps grep?
[08:38] <[Ag0ny] > ok vonguard, I found the sun java jdk package, I took off multiverse and universe and re-added them and updated
[08:39] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : nice
[08:39] <vonguard> then do eclipse again
[08:39] <vonguard> make sure to uninstall gcj!
[08:40] <[Ag0ny] > ffs
[08:40] <[Ag0ny] > now it crashes
[08:40] <[Ag0ny] > I'll do it from command line
[08:40] <vonguard> doh
[08:40] <[Ag0ny] > and... I get a goddamn segmentation fault?!
[08:40] <[Ag0ny] > wtf can't people code right?
[08:41] <nothlit> !java
[08:41] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:42] <CountDown> I recently upgraded to Edgy and found that neither Ubuntu's default network monitor nor network-manager work properly anymore.  In particular, wireless networks are not handled by either.  I have to manually go into /etc/network/interfaces to configure a wireless network now.  Anyone else have similar problems and know of a solution?
[08:42] <x-r00t-x> mecan anyone tell me who do i change ubuntu screen after grub menu and before login screen
[08:42] <Catshrimp> Meh, okay, I found the culprit.  I appears not only xserver-xorg needs to be installed, but also x-window-system-core
[08:42] <Geoffrey2> anyone tried Flash 9 for Windows under wine?  Does that work better under Ubuntu than the Flash 9 Beta for Linux does at present?
[08:43] <vonguard> CountDown: I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM!
[08:43] <vonguard> and i cannot find an answer!
[08:43] <x-r00t-x> vonguard, what problem?
[08:43] <CountDown> vonguard: I'm running on an IBM T42p.  What are you using?
[08:44] <vonguard> the network manager is borrked
[08:44] <CountDown> x-r00t-x: See my post above.
[08:44] <vonguard> Asus Az3000
[08:44] <dawkirst> Hi. This is off-topic, but I figured you guys would probably know: what brand of laptop should I be looking at when buying?
[08:44] <vonguard> weird laptop, but it's an intel chipset
[08:44] <vonguard> dawkirst: dell for price, apple for quality
[08:45] <Stork> help, i don't know my sudo password, but do know my root password. what can i do?
[08:45] <Cobain> dawkirst, im happy with my latitude d620
[08:45] <Cobain> cost $900
[08:45] <x-r00t-x> oh man i naver had problem like that so i am sorry
[08:45] <vonguard> Stork: yer sudo password is yer root password
[08:45] <Cobain> dell outlet is the best
[08:45] <CountDown> vonguard: You have the same problem with both network monitor and network manager?
[08:45] <dawkirst> vonguard: why Dell?
[08:45] <vonguard> Dell is cheapest
[08:45] <vonguard> $399, can't beat it
[08:45] <vonguard> CountDown: i have a major network manager problem
[08:45] <Cobain> latitudes come with a 3 year next business day on site warranty standard
[08:46] <Stork> vonguard, it can't be. the root password doesn't work with sudo
[08:46] <jamesbrose> How Do i change the resolution in the boot loading screen and the shutdown screen?
[08:46] <dawkirst> Thanks; what about IBM / Lenovo?
[08:46] <vonguard> CountDown: i can't see any wireless activity outside of my home network's. even when miles away
[08:46] <Tomcat_> Stork: sudo password = user password
[08:46] <Cobain> whoa google is down?
[08:46] <vonguard> no, google is not down
[08:46] <davor> Cobain umm, nope
[08:46] <Cobain> nm back up..
[08:46] <vonguard> yer probably having dns issues
[08:46] <davor> Cobain lol
[08:46] <Cobain> no it was a google message
[08:47] <vonguard> really?
[08:47] <vonguard> heh
[08:47] <paguilera> Hmm... well, that didn't work.
[08:47] <CountDown> vonguard: Yeah, it seems to work on booting up, but afterward goes kaput.
[08:47] <Cobain> said something about "we are having technical problems"
[08:47] <vonguard> CountDown: mine doesn't work at all
[08:47] <Cobain> really old google logo too
[08:47] <x-r00t-x> vonguard, can you tell me the price of core 2 duo laptop price ?
[08:47] <irc> how do you install KDE and XORG when I didn't install the GUI in the first place.
[08:47] <vonguard> CountDown: i used to have issues in dapper, on a different rig. ethereal would pull all traffic for 5 seconds, then see nothing
[08:47] <belfegorash> when i switch user and try to login with root ...the password said that is invalid why?
[08:47] <vonguard> x-r00t-x: no, but the web can
[08:48] <x-r00t-x> irc, kde right ? ok try apt-get install kde-desktop
[08:48] <[Ag0ny] > ok vonguard rebuilt my repository list again and finally got apt-get to let me try an install of sun-java5-jdk
[08:48] <x-r00t-x> vonguard, find the price for me dude :D
[08:48] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : good luck
[08:48] <vonguard> x-r00t-x: dood, come on. you can do this! besides, apple's are 1099
[08:48] <irc> r00tZ thanks bro.  I really appreciate it.
[08:49] <x-r00t-x> irc,  you are welcome
[08:49] <vonguard> belfegorash: because ubuntu does not like it when you login as root
[08:49] <x-r00t-x> irc, if you want to install gnome . apt-get install gnome-desktop
[08:49] <vonguard> belfegorash: it prefers you to login as user, then sudo -s
[08:49] <Cobain> http://www.smokedot.org/screenshot.png
[08:49] <x-r00t-x> irc,  and i dont know about XORG
[08:49] <belfegorash> aha ok thanku u
[08:50] <irc> x-r00t-x: i think it's just a matter of apt-get install xorg...
[08:50] <Cobain> no one else keeps getting that message randomly? maybe its just with the customized page
[08:50] <vonguard> yeah
[08:50] <vonguard> google looks fine to me
[08:51] <x-r00t-x> irc,  maybe its something like xorg-desktop or xorg . you may try ubuntuguide.org
[08:51] <mneptok> sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
[08:51] <jamesbrose> How Do i change the resolution in the boot loading screen and the shutdown screen?
[08:52] <mneptok> but gnome-desktop depends on xserver-xorg, so it should resolve for that dep when you install gnome
[08:52] <x-r00t-x> jamesbrose, umm where ? i didnt get you
[08:52] <mneptok> jamesbrose: by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:52] <Catshrimp> irc: you need to apt-get install kubuntu-desktop to get the kde desktop
[08:53] <jamesbrose> <mneptok> I have a 15 inch lcd, what do i need to change?
[08:54] <x-r00t-x> jamesbrose,   vga=785

[08:54] <mneptok> x-r00t-x: please don't paste flood
[08:54] <vonguard> eh, who cares
[08:54] <jamesbrose> what about depth, Do i need to add something for that?
[08:54] <vonguard> i'm not offended
[08:54] <x-r00t-x> mneptok, i know the rules. ok?
[08:55] <vonguard> jamesbrose: depth is the number of colors
[08:55] <mneptok> x-r00t-x: then please don't paste flood ;)
[08:55] <x-r00t-x> jamesbrose,  find # defoptions=quiet splash
[08:55] <x-r00t-x> mneptok,  its was my mistake. get it ?
[08:55] <mneptok> x-r00t-x: apology accepted.
[08:55] <jamesbrose> kernel		/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 root=/dev/hdd3 ro quiet splash vga=791
[08:55] <jamesbrose> correct?
[08:56] <mneptok> correct
[08:56] <x-r00t-x> yes
[08:56] <mneptok> jamesbrose: you can add that parameter to the commented section that gets automatically added with kernel updates
[08:56] <Lovloss> #beryl is silent and dead, but i *REALLY* need someone who knows this stuff :,(
[08:56] <jamesbrose> ok
[08:56] <mneptok> (just do not uncomment it)
[08:57] <Lovloss> every single time i install it, it seems like i get an error starting x after a rooboot
[08:57] <Lovloss> *re
[08:57] <vonguard> Lovloss: check digg for beryl links>
[08:57] <vonguard> ?
[08:57] <vonguard> lots of howtos there
[08:57] <x-r00t-x> Lovloss, everyone knew that :P
[08:57] <Lovloss> I had a guy who made the beryl official website walk me through installation
[08:57] <vonguard> heh, beryl = beta!
[08:58] <[Ag0ny] > :> it crashes
[08:58] <x-r00t-x> he didnt update the grub . sudo update-grub
[08:58] <[Ag0ny] > :(
[08:58] <x-r00t-x> :S
[08:58] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : oh no!
[08:58] <x-r00t-x> crash what?
[08:58] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : have you first uninstalled gcj?
[08:58] <[Ag0ny] > yeup
[08:58] <vonguard> [Ag0ny]  is having problems with the KDE equivalent of Synaptic
[08:59] <Lovloss> Look, i think the problem is that i downloaded an nvidia driver. the errors it gives me are all nvidia
[08:59] <Justy-> Hello, good morning everybody
[08:59] <vonguard> hi
[08:59] <mneptok> [Ag0ny] : do the command line tools work (apt-get, aptitude, etc)?
[08:59] <belfegorash> when in instal ubuntu imust instal and drivers?
[08:59] <[Ag0ny] > :/ hold on
[08:59] <[Ag0ny] > I've been using the command line tools sofar since I gave up on adept
[09:00] <Catshrimp> belfegorash: depends on your hardware config
[09:00] <Lovloss> does anyone know how to go about choosing an nvidia driver for your architecture? Im using a Geforce FX 5500 and my CPU is 1.5 ghz with a cache of 64 kb
[09:00] <belfegorash> is old
[09:00] <vonguard> belfegorash: it should handle it, but for advanced graphics cards, like new nvidias, you have to install the company's version
[09:00] <mneptok> [Ag0ny] : so that's yes, the CLI tools work?
[09:00] <Catshrimp> belfegorash: probably not then
[09:00] <belfegorash> i have nvidia geforce 4 mx
[09:00] <[Ag0ny] > yes
[09:00] <belfegorash> is old
[09:00] <[Ag0ny] > sort of
[09:00] <Catshrimp> belfegorash: probably not then
[09:00] <[Ag0ny] > the eclipse I installed crashes
[09:00] <x-r00t-x> mneptok, hey can you paste your grub.lst to pastebin ? plesae...
[09:00] <vonguard> belfegorash: that card is very underpowered, it may not do even the simplest things
[09:00] <[Ag0ny] > jdk seems fine though
[09:00] <mneptok> [Ag0ny] : and you're trying to use Adept?
[09:00] <belfegorash> ok thanks
[09:00] <[Ag0ny] > not anymore
[09:01] <[Ag0ny] > I can function on a cli
[09:01] <vonguard> heh
[09:01] <mneptok> [Ag0ny] : so ... you want help with Adept, Eclipse, or .... ?
[09:01] <Cyber> hi guys
[09:01] <vonguard> eclipse is in universe, right?
[09:01] <[Ag0ny] > it's more of getting eclipse to install and work that I'm concerned about
[09:01] <vonguard> [Ag0ny]  wants to install SUn JDK and run Eclipse on it
[09:01] <Lovloss> :( *sits on install disk, knowing that he probably has to clean install ubuntu AGAIN*
[09:02] <Cyber> does this look right?  The following partitions are going to be formatted:
[09:02] <Cyber>      partition #1 of /dev/hdb as ext3
[09:02] <Cyber>      partition #5 of /dev/hdb as swap
[09:02] <vonguard> Lovloss: stay away from xgl and beryl for now
[09:02] <x-r00t-x> Cyber,  maybe
[09:02] <[Ag0ny] > I've successfully apt-got sun-java5-jdk and the eclipse packages and dependencies
[09:02] <x-r00t-x> yes Cyber
[09:02] <vonguard> Cyber: yes
[09:02] <Cyber> thanks x-root
[09:02] <[Ag0ny] > but eclipse crashes on launch
[09:02] <Cyber> i been having such issues with trying to get it set up
[09:02] <[Ag0ny] > and the logs aren't telling me much
[09:02] <Catshrimp> Lovloss: it's not the end of the world.  ask me how many times i've installed operating systems just tonight ;)
[09:02] <Lovloss> *sigh*
[09:02] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : hell
[09:02] <[Ag0ny] > worse
[09:02] <Cyber> so i deleted every thing on the hard drive and left it empty, then i let the auto formater do that
[09:02] <tyrone> vonguard: lol you new and not able to install xgl huh?
[09:03] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : perhaps a restart?
[09:03] <[Ag0ny] > :/
[09:03] <Lovloss> i used to use beryl all the time, just in glx mode with the basic driver, not in aiglx...
[09:03] <Cyber> if this thing crashes while trying to install python again im going to kill some one
[09:03] <[Ag0ny] > we'll see I guess
[09:03] <vonguard> tyrone: i just avoid volotile stuff
[09:03] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, are you trying to make ubuntu default
[09:03] <vonguard> tyrone: i use ubuntu on my work machine, so i don't want to have turbulence.
[09:03] <Cyber> yea, its a clean hard drive
[09:03] <Lovloss> I wonder if my hardware is too crappy for AIXGL
[09:03] <tyrone> vonguard: i got the nicks confused nvm
[09:03] <Cyber> it must be the only OS on the system
[09:03] <x-r00t-x> Cyber,  then have fun :D
[09:03] <Cyber> lol why u say taht?
[09:03] <Cyber> some whint wrong in that config?

[09:16] <Cyber> both had no errors, but throw the same error :/
[09:16] <vonguard> and EVERY time it crashes while installing python?
[09:16] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, restart live cd and boot again with the live cd . on grub menu you can see test disk or something like that . select check disk . maybe some problem on your disk
[09:16] <CVirus> Any Tibia players around ?
[09:16] <Lovloss> Spomeone in #beryl said that i did not install a kernal module for nvidia.
[09:16] <vonguard> yeah, good idea x-r00t-x
[09:16] <Lovloss> Does anyone know the oslution?
[09:16] <Cyber> done that x-root-x, for both cd's and there are no problems
[09:16] <vonguard> Lovloss: go to nvidia.com and get the drivers
[09:16] <nicholaspaul> Does anyone here know the diff between Ubuntu and Yellow Dog?
[09:16] <tyrone> CVirus: maybe you convict me to start playing it
[09:16] <Lovloss> I already installed an nvidia driver
[09:17] <Catshrimp> tyrone: best of luck to you
[09:17] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: yellow dog is it's own little linux distro for mac
[09:17] <belfegorash> it doesnt work....
[09:17] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: ubuntu is a debian-based distribution built in South Africa by people who talk funny
[09:17] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: oh i see. Should it operate similar to Ubuntu on ppc?
[09:17] <CVirus> tyrone: I haven't started playing it yet as i cant get it working on my Intel ... it needs an nvidia or an ATI ... thats why I need support getting it to work on Intel
[09:17] <tyrone> Catshrimp: thx ^^ i'll just eat enough choc santas then i'll be ok
[09:17] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: oh i talk funny too.. lol!
[09:17] <Cyber> LOL vonguard i dont talk funny
[09:17] <Cyber> !!!
[09:17] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: well, similar in the same way that the mac os 9 is similar to mac os 7
[09:17] <vonguard> like.... same programs, different looks and behaviors
[09:18] <Cyber> but yea, here is the paste of the error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35896/ i can paste the full install log if you like?
[09:18] <Lovloss> vonguard: I installed nvidia driver x86 i think
[09:18] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: aah. so commands should be similar?
[09:18] <tyrone> free medieval fantasy?
[09:18] <vonguard> Cyber: i think all south africans talk funny
[09:18] <CVirus> tyrone: www.Tibia.com
[09:18] <vonguard> in the same way new yorkers talk funny
[09:18] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: some think I'm south african! heheh
[09:18] <vonguard> and australians talk funny
[09:18] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  and americans ;)
[09:18] <Cyber> i am south african =D
[09:18] <vonguard> most of all
[09:19] <vonguard> americans talk like they have sticks up their butts
[09:19] <meshyf> Is there a fairly easy way to get WPA encryption with my wifi card working?
[09:19] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  dont knock it til you try it...
[09:19] <tyrone> CVirus: damn you must be kiddin... you don't need any accerlation for this lol
[09:19] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: hahah
[09:19] <tyrone> it looks like crap :-)
=== Wrentype is now known as Maverynthia
[09:19] <belfegorash> i trywith /usr/bin/ and i find clamscan...but it doesnt open
[09:19] <vonguard> meshyf: not that i know of
[09:19] <vonguard> i have hella wireless problems
[09:19] <CVirus> tyrone: I know
[09:19] <meshyf> Bummer :|
[09:19] <vonguard> to use the american phrasing
[09:19] <Cyber> how do i fix my error!
[09:19] <Cyber> some one!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:20] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: i'm just worried that if i get into YDL that it will be a whole new set of problems. It does seem to install on ppc easier.
[09:20] <vonguard> Cyber: did you try x-r00t-x's suggestion?
[09:20] <tyrone> CVirus: so why would you need an ati or nv vga in order to play this?? o_0
[09:20] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: it would be
[09:20] <Cyber> vonguard: yes, before he suggested it, ive check both CD's and there are no problems on them
[09:20] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: my advice? use ubuntu
[09:20] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  uh oh. so i should forget all i've learned?! [yea i'm thinking i should too... ] 
[09:20] <vonguard> Cyber: he suggested checking the disk
[09:20] <vonguard> Cyber: not the cd's
[09:21] <Cyber> check the disk? how ??
[09:21] <Lovloss> Im just getting zero help. I did *exactly* as people said to do to set up a new directx driver and beryl, and both times ive booted up and got a big "cant load x!" message
[09:21] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: well, yellowdog, as far as i know, does not have much steam behind it. small developer group
[09:21] <Lovloss> im at wits end
[09:21] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: ubuntu is on fire. lots of movement and advancing.
[09:21] <belfegorash> how can i open clamscan?is executable,with what?
[09:21] <vonguard> Lovloss: dude, give up on beryl
[09:21] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  oh yes, The forum is pretty quiet.
[09:21] <Lovloss> vonguard: I like beryl.
[09:22] <Cyber> u mean the HD right? but if the HD is borked, why can i see it in g-parted!!!! hey vonguard?
[09:22] <Lovloss> vonguard: and i enjoyed using it a lot before i clean installed
[09:22] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: yeah. ubuntu is very popular right now. i think it even pisses off some of the fatter, sassier Debian guys
[09:22] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: what flavor of Mac do you have?
[09:22] <vonguard> Lovloss: sometimes, in Linux, you just have to resign yourself to coming back in six months and trying again
[09:22] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: well, the one in question is a Powerbook G3 Lombard.
[09:22] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: you might want to use Xubuntu on that. you'll get better performance.
[09:22] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: go for ubuntu
[09:23] <Cyber> vonguard: how do i check the disk?
[09:23] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, restart your pc
[09:23] <x-r00t-x> ...
[09:23] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: the best thing is Synaptic package manager. All the software that exists for the OS is available with 1 click
[09:23] <Lovloss> Well. how helpfull.
[09:23] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: vonguard.. yea. I think you're right.
[09:23] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: the Lombards and Wall Streets and other pre-G4 P-books tend to be happier with Xubuntu
[09:23] <vonguard> Lovloss: dude, beryl is not complete. software doesn't always work, esspecially when it's not done
[09:23] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: yea? oh ok. i was wondering if YDL did something special for ppc?
[09:24] <tyrone> Catshrimp: what do you study? insomnia?
[09:24] <vonguard> VLC was like that for a long time
[09:24] <vonguard> now it rules, but for the longest time, it pissed me off so bad
[09:24] <Rprp> well
[09:24] <Rprp> does someone know about APF?
[09:24] <Rprp> hostname: Host name lookup failure
[09:24] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: not really. but GNOME and KDE have higher hardware requirements than does XFCE
[09:24] <Cyber> x-root-x ure talking about check the cd to make sure none of the files are currupt right? thats one of the options that comes up at boot "check CD" aswell as "boot or install ubuntu"
[09:24] <vonguard> it's still buggy mind you
[09:24] <Rprp> if i try to stop it
[09:24] <Rprp> hostname: Host name lookup failure
[09:24] <vonguard> damn lazy, riotous french
[09:24] <Rprp> /# apf -f
[09:24] <Rprp> hostname: Host name lookup failure
[09:24] <Rprp> :(
[09:24] <x-r00t-x> Cyber,  yes .
[09:24] <Rprp> Can someone me help?
[09:24] <gemby_> With APF?
[09:25] <vonguard> Cyber: i think he meant to check the hard drive. there should be an option to do that
[09:25] <mneptok> Rprp: APF? or AFP?
[09:25] <Cyber> ok now x-r00t-x i have done that for both ubuntu cd's i have and both time it has said that the cd's are prefectly fine
[09:25] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: one problem i'm running into is trying to find a wifi usb adapter. Do the same rules apply?
[09:25] <Rprp> APF,
[09:25] <Rprp> Its a firewall
[09:25] <vonguard> and literally, check the cd face for scratches and boogers
[09:25] <mneptok> yup
[09:25] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, sorry i cant help more with it anymore
[09:25] <meshyf> Anyone here use Democracy player?
[09:25] <Rprp> But still it doesnt stop :/
[09:25] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: don't the Lombards have built-in ethernet?
[09:25] <Cyber> x-r00t-x:  thank you for ure help, i had already done that tho =D
[09:25] <gemby_> Advanced Policy Firewall?
[09:25] <Rprp> yes
[09:25] <tyrone> can i integrate the password of my remote ssh box in the ssh command?
[09:25] <Rprp> /# apf -f
[09:25] <Rprp> hostname: Host name lookup failure
[09:25] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: ah, so if it doesnt work on Ubuntu it wont work on YDL?
[09:25] <Rprp> How can i fix that?
[09:25] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: yea, they do.
[09:25] <gemby_> apf -f ?
[09:25] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, wc
[09:25] <Rprp> yes, i did
[09:25] <Cyber> ok my next option is im going to paste the entire install log & u guys can maybe check it :/
[09:25] <nicholaspaul> mneptok:  and PCMCIA
[09:25] <mneptok> Rprp: sudo invoke-rc.d apf stop
[09:26] <Cyber> but i can see the HD in g-parted
[09:26] <Cyber> its there and its partitions
[09:26] <Rprp> hostname: Host name lookup failure
[09:26] <Rprp> That does it say
[09:26] <Rprp> :x
[09:26] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: you just want another adapter, or ... ?
[09:26] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: no telling. YDL is very mac specific. but ubuntu is just more mature and capable
[09:26] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, yea everyone can see that . erm
[09:26] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  well, i dont mind giving YDL a spin. I have ubuntu on a couple of other machines already :)
[09:27] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: it doesnt have wifi, and i'm mainly wifi in the house .
[09:27] <belfegorash> i should install something to open this exe?
[09:27] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: yeah, give it a shot
[09:27] <Cyber> but x-r00t-x if he HD had an issue i shouldnt be able to see that ? aswell as that some of the OS files have been written to the HD, but the installer crashes while trying to install the stupid python stuff
[09:27] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: might be fun :-)
[09:27] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: YDL is a distro with little future. PPC is dead as a desktop architecture, it seems.
[09:27] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: the YDL folks just keep plugging away. gotta admire them
[09:27] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: lol
[09:27] <vonguard> mneptok: Xbox 360 is Risc
[09:27] <gemby_> Rprp: Is valid server in resolv.conf ?
[09:27] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: hmmm. Good point.
[09:27] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: do the Rev1 Airport cards fit in the Lombards/W-Streets ?
[09:27] <Rprp> Where can i find resolv.conf?
[09:27] <Manstein> Cyber is it by any means a sata drive with the compatibility jumper ON?
[09:27] <vonguard> mneptok: yes
[09:27] <gemby_> sudo pico /etc/resolv.conf
[09:27] <mneptok> vonguard: XBox 360 is not a desktop computer. :)
[09:28] <nicholaspaul> mneptok:  ooo cool!
[09:28] <vonguard> could be
[09:28] <Rprp> Oke,
[09:28] <Cyber> no its not a sata drive, altho when booting and shutting down my machine, it does say next to raid "failed"
[09:28] <x-r00t-x> hes Cyber stop trying install pythom
[09:28] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: vonguard so i should shop for an airport (non extreme) ?
[09:28] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, you got dvd or cd ?
[09:28] <Rprp> nameserver 217.149.196.6
[09:28] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: confirm they work in the Lombards. if so, then ja.
[09:28] <Rprp> Thats in it, but its not my server ip
[09:28] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: yeah
[09:28] <Cyber> but x-r00t-x it installs by itself from the cd, i cant select certain packages to install :/
[09:29] <Cyber> cd not dvd
[09:29] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: should be cheap
[09:29] <nicholaspaul> mneptok:  woohoo! i have an Asus that i wanted to get working in it...
[09:29] <vonguard> pull out that keyboard and make sure first
[09:29] <x-r00t-x> :S you must try ubuntuforum.org
[09:29] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  oh right.
[09:29] <x-r00t-x> http://ubuntuforums.org/ *
[09:29] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: you can pop up the keyboard easily, when it's off. there's a spot there for the card, i believe
[09:29] <Cyber> x-r00t-x: check this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35897/
[09:29] <Cyber> vonguard: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35897/
[09:29] <Cyber> check that and see
[09:29] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  oh sweet. i'll take a look.
[09:29] <gemby_> Rprp: Please, check what nameserver should be for you, ask your provider or so
[09:29] <Cyber> thats the complete sys install log
[09:30] <Rprp> Well, it doesnt stop, the nameserver is correct.
[09:30] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  i also need an ac adapter.. i dont suppose you know much about those do ya?
[09:30] <Rprp> Can i delete it? xD
[09:30] <gemby_> I usaly have caching only nameserver on machine
[09:30] <gemby_> What, apf?
[09:30] <Rprp> yes
[09:30] <gemby_> Yes, burt apf is only frontend for iptables
[09:31] <vonguard> Cyber: no idea
[09:31] <Rprp> hm.
[09:31] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, what version are you trying to install?
[09:31] <vonguard> Cyber: are you installing under sudo?
[09:31] <vonguard> Cyber: have you formated the drive?
[09:31] <x-r00t-x> vonguard, he install ubuntu not softwares
[09:31] <x-r00t-x> vonguard, auto format :-"
[09:32] <vonguard> so what the hell is wrong here
[09:32] <Cyber> not that i know of vonguard, i put the livecd in, boot to the desktop, there is an icon called "install" and when u click it, it attemtps to install ubuntu to your HD
[09:32] <Cyber> i used the auto partitioner to set every ting up
[09:32] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: looks like Airport first in the Pismos
[09:32] <Cyber> when it tried to install the python package it dies
[09:32] <vonguard> is windows on there too, cyber?
[09:32] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: looks like Airport first *appeared* in the Pismos
[09:32] <Cyber> no vonguard
[09:32] <vonguard> Cyber:  i think it actually chokes on the gnome screensaver
[09:32] <mneptok> nicholaspaul: so, no. no Airport love for you :/
[09:32] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: Thx for checking :)
[09:32] <Cyber> i dont know but it keeps dying at the same point :/
[09:32] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: i may have been wrong. first gen black g3 laptops = no wireless
[09:32] <nicholaspaul> mneptok: and...doh...! Another brick wall!
[09:33] <vonguard> but no matter, ubuntu supports pcmcia better than apple airport
[09:33] <vonguard> and so does kismac
[09:33] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  oh ok. I wish i could use my Asus WL167g.
[09:33] <vonguard> Cyber: dunno dood
[09:33] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: hmmm. G is not so good,
[09:33] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: ubuntu is sadly lacking in wireless support, esspecially for new stuff
[09:34] <mneptok> smoke break. time to suit up and face the cold.
[09:34] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: but it's not ubuntu's fault. it's wireless card makers
[09:34] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, in what % ?
[09:34] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: so YDL would be sucky too
[09:34] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: yea. I used to have hoary on my G4 and finally got the Airport extreme working.
[09:34] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: yuck
[09:34] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, burn one more cd .................................
[09:34] <mneptok> jebus, it's -13C
[09:34] <x-r00t-x> then try again
[09:34] <vonguard> Cyber: yeah, maybe yer image is borked
[09:35] <vonguard> Cyber: redownload the image
[09:35] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  hmmm. yea... well i do have a Linksys WET thingy, that will work.
[09:35] <fuoco> anyone uses r300 driver in edgy?
[09:35] <vonguard> wet?
[09:35] <vonguard> sounds dirty
[09:35] <vonguard> fuoco not me
[09:35] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  hahahha its a wifi adapter you plug in the wall.
[09:35] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: (wireless  you plug in... hmm..)
[09:35] <x-r00t-x> Cyber, lol @ 082. chroot: cannot run command `apt-get': No such file or directory
[09:36] <vonguard> usb?
[09:36] <x-r00t-x> Cyber,  everything is missing on your cd .. reburn it
[09:36] <vonguard> x-r00t-x: yeah, that made me scratch my head
[09:36] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  no its ethernet.
[09:36] <vonguard> x-r00t-x: redownload the image
[09:36] <x-r00t-x> lol @ vonguard
[09:36] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: oh!
[09:36] <x-r00t-x> what vonguard  ?
[09:37] <nicholaspaul> vonguard:  yea, could be worse. I could spend 4000 hrs making it wireless...!
[09:37] <vonguard> if cyber's discs are always bad, he needs to redownload the image
[09:37] <x-r00t-x> vonguard,  why are you telling me to download the img file again? my ubuntu works as well :P
[09:37] <vonguard> x-r00t-x: heh, not you, sorry. cyber needs to
[09:37] <x-r00t-x> :P vonguard
[09:37] <vonguard> nicholaspaul: usb wireless adapters can work
[09:38] <nicholaspaul> vonguard: but its finding one with the right chipset, isnt it?
[09:38] <x-r00t-x> usb wireless = bluetooth?
[09:38] <ponsfrilus> 'lo
[09:38] <dungodung> I'm guessing it's safe to go with the latest software updates

[09:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about deadkeys - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:44] <vonguard> belfegorash: you throw files at it

[09:44] <belfegorash> yes but i can find clamav anywhere
[09:44] <belfegorash> cant
[09:45] <vonguard> hmmm
[09:45] <Koffa> vonguard: tried googling for solution but found nothing... can't see anything out of place in the config either...
[09:45] <vonguard> belfegorash: should be in the applications menu> accessories
[09:45] <vonguard> koffa: i don't know what dead keys is
[09:46] <vonguard> koffa: are those extra keys on your keyboard?
[09:46] <belfegorash> vonguard:is not there
[09:46] <Koffa> vonguard: when you hit  it doesn't show up immediately but if you press a right after it you get  on top of a...
[09:46] <mneptok> belfegorash: Clam AV is not a gui app
[09:46] <Koffa> and no, I don't want to define a compose-key
[09:46] <mneptok> belfegorash: ClamAV is a background daemon that you configure and initialize from the command line
[09:47] <vonguard> belfegorash: don't worry about a virus scanner. yer not too likely to contract one
[09:47] <opi> hi
[09:47] <poquedoraqu> what will it do to my com to remov linux-restricted-formats-generic ?  They said in #beryl that it may be keeping my computer from using the new nvidia driver. I get an 'x' error message that says it doesnt comply with x
[09:47] <opi> was there an new Xorg upload in Edgy?
[09:47] <sergevn> Is it true that swapping, bottlenecks your cpu?
[09:47] <vonguard> Koffa: what is this keyboard you have?

[09:47] <vonguard> belfegorash: there are linux virus, but not very many
[09:48] <Krux0> This is the best i can come up with at the time: dpkg --get-selections | grep install|awk -F" " '{ print $1 }' | apt-get -y -d --reinstall
[09:48] <vonguard> belfegorash: nothing like windows
[09:48] <vonguard> belfegorash: and windows viruses... virii do not effect linux machines
[09:48] <belfegorash> this is a release
[09:48] <meshyf> Imma take a wild guess and say, there probably isn't any Flash support for Ubuntu, is there?
[09:48] <belfegorash> because when i have windows...pfff....
[09:49] <belfegorash> a lot of viruses
[09:49] <opi> ekhm, so, anyone knows if there was an Xorg upgrade, or not? My friend lost a desktop and I have to help her over the Internet as she's in Holland :)
[09:49] <vonguard> belfegorash: just remember: all those people sending you viruses via email are expecting windows. you are safe
[09:49] <SeyToN> lol
[09:49] <sergevn> Im from holland

[09:50] <vonguard> just doing my time in the ubuntu techsupport barrel
[09:50] <kittyhawk> I have an obscure question if anyone can help
[09:51] <vonguard> cmt^^: not likely
[09:51] <kittyhawk> the colors on my virtual terminal are all screwy, so that I can't read many things (man pages for example)
[09:51] <vonguard> cmt^^: logitech isn't so nice about its drivers
[09:51] <vonguard> kittyhawk: weird
[09:51] <cmt^^> vonguard - :<
[09:51] <vonguard> kittyhawk: someone here has to know where those prefernces are stored
[09:51] <[Nige] > hi all
[09:51] <vonguard>  is that in /root?
[09:51] <cmt^^> vonguard - do you know of anyone who uses skype for linux?
[09:52] <kittyhawk> the highlighted text is dark dark brown
[09:52] <vonguard> cmt^^: nope. but it apperently works in edgy
[09:52] <raphink> cmt^^: what is it exactly?
[09:52] <raphink> cmt^^: only a keyboard, a mouse and a microphone+earplugs ?
[09:52] <kittyhawk> the real problem is that nethack is unplayable :)
[09:52] <raphink> cmt^^: I don't see a reason why this would not work
[09:52] <cmt^^> raphink - yup
[09:53] <cmt^^> raphink - considering skype works, and skype is what it's built for...
[09:53] <[Ag0ny] > vonguard, you still around?
[09:53] <raphink> cmt^^: skype works fine in Ubuntu
[09:53] <raphink> cmt^^: but I would rather use ekiga or wengo
[09:53] <vonguard> yeah
[09:53] <raphink> or jabbin
[09:53] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : what's up?
[09:53] <raphink> skype is crap ;)
[09:53] <meshugga> i have a t30 and i want to run two different x servers on the lcd and on the external vga connector
[09:53] <kittyhawk> if no-one knows, does anyone at least have an idea of where I might look?  I'm out of things to try
[09:53] <meshugga> anyone of you who has done this?
[09:53] <[Nige] > I am running ubuntu on a core duo laptop, but I want to scale the cpu down even further, it sits idle at 996. I want to know  if scaling it will conserve battery power
[09:53] <raphink> kittyhawk: do you mean in the gnome terminal?
[09:54] <kittyhawk> no, the ctrl-alt-fn terminals
[09:54] <[Ag0ny] > well, eclipse still crashes, but now I have the added bonus of being refused any operations on it, as in I can't uninstall or reinstall
[09:54] <vonguard> meshugga: there's gotta be a way to get a tty on the second monitor, but i don't know it
[09:54] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : where did this eclipse come from?
[09:54] <raphink> kittyhawk: oh in ttys
[09:54] <[Ag0ny] > apt-get
[09:54] <vonguard> kittyhawk: check ubuntu forums
[09:54] <vonguard> !ubuntuforums
[09:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuntuforums - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:54] <cmt^^> when it says "requires qt 3.2", what package should i download/install?
[09:54] <vonguard> !forums
[09:54] <ubotu> The Ubuntu forums can be found at http://www.ubuntuforums.org. There is also a channel on IRC Freenode #ubuntuforums.
[09:55] <raphink> kittyhawk: iirc these are set in .bashrdc
[09:55] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : geez
[09:55] <raphink> kittyhawk: .bashrc
[09:55] <[Ag0ny] > yeah
[09:55] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : i have no idea what to say.
[09:55] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : might be help on java.net
[09:55] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : or ubuntu forums
[09:55] <vonguard> manually remove eclipse?
[09:55] <vonguard> like, file by file?
[09:55] <kittyhawk> raphink: thanks, I'll try that.
[09:55] <[Ag0ny] > rm the elcipse dirs?

[09:56] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : i guess
[09:56] <raphink> how did you install eclipse [Ag0ny] ?
[09:56] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : i know it stashes things elsewhere
[09:56] <vonguard> raphink: apt-get
[09:56] <raphink> well then apt-get remove
[09:56] <[Ag0ny] > can't
[09:56] <raphink> removing programs manually when they have been installed by apt-get is the worst idea
[09:56] <vonguard> [Ag0ny] : tried that, i think, right?
[09:56] <[Ag0ny] > get the following error
[09:56] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : how so?
[09:56] <cmt^^> There are a bunch of different qt-packages to download, which one do I install when the application requires "QT 3.2"?
[09:57] <vonguard> cmt^^: uhm.... whatever's not dev related
[09:57] <raphink> cmt^^: isn't there dependencies on the skype package?

[09:58] <belfegorash> ok i will:D

[09:58] <raphink> vonguard: limewire is certainly not in universe
[09:58] <raphink> because it' not open-source
[09:58] <vonguard> multiverse?
[09:58] <vonguard> it's in one of them
[09:58] <mneptok> Frostwire is.
[09:58] <mneptok> Frostwire > Limewire
[09:58] <raphink> no it's not
[09:59] <raphink> in multiverse that is
[09:59] <vonguard> hmmmm
[09:59] <raphink> vonguard: limewire is not distributable
[09:59] <vonguard> i coulda sworn it was
[09:59] <belfegorash> i cant find limewire
[09:59] <raphink> well please check before giving advice :)
[09:59] <vonguard> sorry, no one else was here to help
[09:59] <kittyhawk> everytime I install a development related package apt complains that it's not signed.  I assume I'm missing some public key.
[09:59] <vonguard> but since yer here now, i am done
[09:59] <kittyhawk> anyone know how to fix that?
[10:00] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : seems your dpkg database is screwed
[10:00] <belfegorash> raphink:you got an advice for me?about dld?
[10:00] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : can you try to apt-get udpate ?
[10:00] <[Ag0ny] > without reinstalling the whole base system can I fix that raph
[10:00] <raphink> belfegorash: amule is a good P2P client
[10:00] <mneptok> hmmm, Frostwire seems to have lost its maintainer.
[10:00] <[Ag0ny] > I have
[10:00] <mneptok> grim
[10:00] <belfegorash> ok thank you
[10:01] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : what does it do? Can you post the result in a pastebin?
[10:01] <mneptok> belfegorash: sudo aptitude install gtk-gnutella
[10:01] <[Ag0ny] > update? sure
[10:01] <mneptok> belfegorash: or install Sun's JRE and then use Frostwire
[10:01] <belfegorash> and all this i can find in Synaptic yes?
[10:01] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : otherwise, try "sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update"
[10:01] <mneptok> belfegorash: Frostwire is no longer in the repos
[10:01] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : we'll see if that resets the database properly
[10:02] <mneptok> belfegorash: sun's jre and gtk-gnutella are there, though
[10:02] <belfegorash> ok
[10:02] <belfegorash> thanks
[10:02] <poquedoraqu> sudo dpkg-configure xserver-xorg     gives me the response: command not found
[10:02] <poquedoraqu> does anyone know what i messed up this time
[10:02] <mneptok> poquedoraqu: dpkg-reconfigure
[10:02] <poquedoraqu> ...oh.
[10:02] <poquedoraqu> brb
[10:02] <raphink> poquedoraqu: dpkg-configure doesn't exist ;)
[10:03] <raphink> there's dpkg --configure though
[10:03] <[Ag0ny] > pastebinning it now, still no dice
[10:04] <[Ag0ny] > I get the same error when I try to do dpkg --configure
[10:04] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : can you give me the pastebin link?
[10:04] <qsuc> so here's a general linux question: what's with all the packages named x*?
[10:04] <[Ag0ny] > pastebin's taking forever
[10:04] <dawkirst> Hi. This is off-topic, but what's the difference between Core2 Duo and Core Duo?
[10:04] <qsuc> Core 2 is quadcore
[10:04] <raphink> qsuc: here's a general answer : their name begin with x, so what?
[10:04] <[Ag0ny] > here's the short of it raphink :
[10:04] <qsuc> hahaha, why the pattern
[10:05] <[Ag0ny] > kaz@shokii:~$ sudo dpkg --configure
[10:05] <[Ag0ny] > dpkg: parse error, in file `/var/lib/dpkg/available' near line 204 package `librecode0':
[10:05] <[Ag0ny] >  `Depends' field, syntax error after reference to package `libc6'
[10:05] <[Ag0ny] > kaz@shokii:~$
[10:05] <qsuc> why not just make it one letter shorter
[10:05] <bigbro> qsuc: They generally have to do with X11, the graphical interface.
[10:05] <qsuc> ahhhh
[10:05] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : who told you to do a "dpkg --configure" ?
[10:05] <[Ag0ny] > I get the same error when I try apt-get remove eclipse
[10:05] <bigbro> qsuc: So man is a text based man page viewer, xman is the equivalent viewer with a GUI.
[10:05] <[Ag0ny] > <raphink> there's dpkg --configure though
[10:05] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : yes, I was answering someone else who asked about dpkg-recongiure
[10:05] <[Ag0ny] > I tried that after doing
[10:05] <qsuc> sweet
[10:05] <qsuc> ah I get it
[10:06] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : I asked you to do "sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update"
[10:06] <[Ag0ny] > the clean and update
[10:06] <[Ag0ny] > it's taking forever to pastebin
[10:06] <[Ag0ny] > I did that
[10:06] <raphink> did you get the same error with the clean && update?
[10:06] <[Ag0ny] > then tried to remove eclipse
[10:06] <[Ag0ny] > no errors shown with clean && update
[10:07] <bigbro> qsuc: Of course, that's not a strict rule. Something like xine is just a package that has a name starting with the letter 'x' AFAICS :)
[10:07] <raphink> [Ag0ny] : PM

[10:37] <tonyyarusso> hhyyjj163_: That's for mainland China - there's more too.
[10:37] <tonyyarusso> !cn
[10:37] <ubotu> For Ubuntu help in Chinese  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[10:38] <ernz> Does anyone know why the maplyer plugins arent working with Firefox from Automatix/Easy Ubuntu?
[10:38] <hhyyjj163_> o ,i see,thank you and ubotu
[10:39] <x-r00t-x> hhyyjj163_, ubotu is a bot :P
[10:40] <hhyyjj163_> a!! i think he is a man, haha
[10:40] <MicrosoftSpy> lovlos: Well be grateful you don't have ATI
[10:41] <hhyyjj163_> ubotu is great
[10:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is great - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:41] <x-r00t-x> lol hhyyjj163_
[10:41] <dkhan> hello - I have a problem when trying to install ruby - it says Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ruby1.8/libruby1.8_1.8.4-1ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb  404 Not Found
[10:41] <dkhan> and the file isn't there
[10:41] <hhyyjj163_> ubotu iptables
[10:41] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[10:42] <ernz> Does anyone know if "Swiftfox" is any good?
[10:42] <hhyyjj163_> realy is a bot,hehe
[10:42] <HuibertGill> dkhan: have you tried reloading the package list with "apt-get update" or the reload button in synaptic?
[10:42] <tonyyarusso> !bot | hhyyjj163_
[10:42] <ubotu> hhyyjj163_: I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[10:43] <dkhan> HuibertGill: yes several times
[10:43] <dkhan> HuibertGill: but I changed my sources - do I have to cleanup something or does apt-get update do this for me
[10:43] <edgy> Hi, how can I change the screen color depth in (k)ubuntu?
[10:44] <hhyyjj163_> hehe its wonderful,thank you tony
[10:44] <HuibertGill> dkhan: apt should take care of that.
[10:44] <rastilin> edgy, Hold on, why change the colour depth.
[10:44] <tyrone> is there a way to burn Alcoholsoft (mds, mdf) images in Ubuntu?
[10:44] <dkhan> HuibertGill ok - so then the dependency is broken?
[10:44] <rastilin> tyrone, you can use ccd2iso to convert them to iso files.
[10:45] <edgy> rastilin: when I connected my laptop to a projector the picture is flickering. so I thought may be the color depth has something to do with it
[10:45] <tonyyarusso> edgy: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' lets you go through the setup of various display options, and that's one of them.  That sounds like a refresh rate issue rather than color depth to me though.  Could be wrong.
[10:45] <edgy> rastilin: in windows it works great btw so it's something related to ubuntu
[10:46] <rastilin> edgy, My money's on the refresh rate being the problem.
[10:46] <tyrone> rastilin: the image is secured with securom. Does this make any difference?
[10:46] <HuibertGill> dkhan: looks like it....
[10:47] <edgy> rastilin: the refresh rate? ok when I am there again I would try to change it but why there is no way to change the colors while it's there in windows? is it useless?
[10:47] <tonyyarusso> If you have your ftp server configured to chroot a user to their home directory, and have a symlink in their ~ to /var/www/user, would they be properly limited to ~ plus /var/www/user, and not be able to go up to /var/www, or would the symlink let them out of the chroot?
[10:48] <rastilin> tyrone, I don't think that even a mdf file can be used to bypass securom's copy protection.
[10:48] <dkhan> HuibertGill: so I better wait a few days for it to resolve?
[10:48] <jahid> hi, i am trying to install ubuntu from cd. the cd is loaidng and asking me to choose an option. i am choosing "run or install ubuntu" then it keeps me waiting showing a progress bar. after that it just show black skin with a blinking cursor for long time withou any progress
[10:48] <jahid> can anyone help me about that?
[10:48] <rastilin> edgy, Because there's really no point in changing the colour depth, nothing needs a different depth.
[10:48] <tonyyarusso> jahid: How much RAM?
[10:49] <rastilin> edgy, I mean nothing at all. You CAN change it from the configuration file and in some distributions. But It wasn't implemented in Ubuntu.
[10:49] <tyrone> rastilin: speaking of color depths, how can i change the brightness of my screen?
[10:49] <jahid> tonyyarusso, more then 1GB
[10:49] <tonyyarusso> jahid: So much for that theory
[10:49] <tonyyarusso> jahid: Did you verify the ISO?
[10:49] <rastilin> tyrone, You mean the gamma? Well your video card controls like "nvidia-settings" will handle that.
[10:49] <cadu> hello, i'm with a strange problem  with the pppoe here, i set up a pppoe connection using pppoeconf (the usual way)....when it connects, resolv.conf gets the dns addresses, but after 10 minutes the connection DIES, when i go check it out, the link is still active but something removed the dns entries from the resolv.conf, what can it be or someone knows what program must be doing this?
[10:50] <jahid> no, should i?
[10:50] <vorpal> jahid: yeah
[10:50] <tonyyarusso> jahid: yeah
[10:50] <tonyyarusso> !verify | jahid
[10:50] <ubotu> jahid: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[10:50] <sergevn> jahid, do you have enough RAM, i had the same problem.
[10:50] <c0> o_Fitnes_Sby_Need_SomeOne
[10:50] <tonyyarusso> jahid: And it's recommended to burn at a slow speed (I use 4x)
[10:50] <sergevn> plug in some ram or install the xubuntu cd
[10:50] <edgy> rastilin: ok thanks for your help
[10:50] <HuibertGill> dkhan: it's the only advise I can give you atm, sorry
[10:50] <jahid> sergevn, i think i have more then one giga ram
=== poh is now known as pohpoh
=== c0 is now known as Co_Fitnes_Sby_Ne
[10:50] <sergevn> jahid, ok hmm
[10:51] <jahid> tonyyarusso, 4x only?
[10:51] <tonyyarusso> jahid: I've gotten away with 16x as well, but the slower you go the safer, so find what you can put up with ;)
[10:51] <ernz> Before on Dapper, embedded multimedia files would play within a browser fine, after using automatix/easy ubuntu. Now I just have a grayed out box with nothing loading, what is this all about and how can I make it work>?
[10:52] <jahid> is there any way to install ubuntu using network? i mean from my laptop to my desktop? they are connected and my laptop is having faster cd rom drive
[10:52] <tyrone> i am using ati with the fglrx driver. is there a way to control the colour settings of my display like gamma and contrast?
[10:52] <bigbro> tonyyarusso: Burning at a slow speed is generally irrelevant nowadays, unless you have an old burner. Drives tend to be tested and optimised for running at their default (usually fastest or close to) speed.
[10:52] <tonyyarusso> ernz: Using scripts is not the best way, and certainly not automatix.
[10:53] <tonyyarusso> !netinstall | jahid
[10:53] <ubotu> jahid: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[10:53] <cadu> bigbro: sure thing, the -media- should be extremely bad for burning speed to make a difference in these new burners
[10:53] <bigbro> tonyyarusso: I've noticed significantly less jitter when burning audio material at 24 speed rather than at 2 speed (on a modern 24x burner)
[10:53] <ernz> tonyyarusso> So if automatix isn't the solution to my problem, what is?
[10:54] <tonyyarusso> bigbro: Well, regardless, just about anyone who's burned a lot of install disks will recommend it.  /me shrugs
[10:54] <bigbro> jahid: Yes - you need the network install disk. I know about this because I have a laptop with a broken CD-ROM drive. You'll have to google for the mini iso image though - I can't remember where it is, sorry.
[10:54] <tonyyarusso> ernz: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats is the proper method
[10:54] <reverseblade> I have 3 files, I want to burn them to DVD from command line, how can I do it ?
[10:54] <jahid> bigbro, tell me little more or an URL
[10:54] <jahid> where can i get network install disk?
[10:54] <bigbro> reverseblade: Are they ISO files? If not, make one ISO file and burn that. growisofs is your friend.
[10:55] <bigbro> jahid: Gimmee a sec and I'll see if I can re-find it.
[10:55] <tonyyarusso> ernz: You have a few choices for plugins (vlc, totem, mplayer), and there's also a FF extension that lets you use an external player
[10:55] <jahid> bigbro, ok
[10:55] <reverseblade> bigbro, they are tar files, do I have to make an ISO file ? if so how ?
[10:55] <reverseblade> bigbro, note that the total size of 3 files is about 4.5 GB
[10:55] <ernz> tonyyarusso> The one I had before allowed me the option also to right click and say "Save as..." do you know which one that was?
[10:55] <reverseblade> bigbro, each 1.5 GB
[10:56] <sergevn> jahid, in the time you are making that construction, you could work in that time and buy an new cddrive for you pc ;)
[10:57] <jahid> sergevn, its my office pc, i dont want to spend of that
[10:57] <jimcooncat> how can I reset an /etc file back to the original that came with the package?
[10:57] <concept10> how do I list all partitions whether mounted our not?
[10:57] <bigbro> jahid: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD?highlight=%28mini.iso%29%7C%28download%29
[10:57] <sergevn> jahid, you got a point there :)
[10:57] <tonyyarusso> ernz: Can't say I do, sorry.  With any of them, right-click > page info > media lets you save things, albeit more tedious.
[10:57] <reverseblade> I have 3 files, I want to burn them to DVD from command line, how can I do it ?
[10:57] <mneptok> jimcooncat: sudo dpkg-reconfigure $packagename (if you're lucky)
[10:57] <tonyyarusso> ernz: I'd guess either mplayer or vlc though
[10:58] <jimcooncat> thenks mneptok
[10:58] <bigbro> reverseblade: That might not fit on a DVD - generally you get about 4.2GB of data on a DVD+-R IME.
[10:58] <ernz> tonyyarusso> OK, will give that a go. Thanks for your help.
[10:58] <jahid> sergevn, yes i got a point:)
[10:58] <tonyyarusso> bigbro: I thought it was 4.7 myself
[10:58] <reverseblade> bigbro, mines have 4.7 gb, but I can put the two by two, that's not a problem. tell me about the solution please
[10:59] <tonyyarusso> reverseblade: I think the 'cdrecord' tool is what you're looking for, which has various frontends to try to make it more friendly.
[10:59] <vorpal> reverseblade: do a search with aptitude/synaptic
[11:00] <bigbro> reverseblade: Put them in a directory (say called  dvd-files/ ) and run something like  growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -R -J dvd-files/
[11:00] <vorpal> it should trun up a useful utility
[11:00] <reverseblade> tonyyarusso, does it work from the command line ? does it burn files to a DVD ?
[11:00] <reverseblade> bigbro, oh I C
[11:00] <tonyyarusso> reverseblade: cdrecord is cli, yes.  I believe it can do DVD, but you'd want to check the man page on that.
[11:00] <bigbro> cdrecord may or may not work - it's for CDs though some versions have an add-on to understand DVD writing. Using growisofs is the supported and generic solution for Linux.
[11:01] <reverseblade> bigbro, and why I can't just explicitly state the file names rather than to put them into a directory
[11:01] <bigbro> And yes - DVDs are marked as 4.7GB of data - but it depends on the formatting, overhead, blocks and files - I generally get about 4.2GB of actual data on a DVD, but YMMV.
[11:01] <maxsoftX_> goooooooooooooooooooodMorning. !! I've a problem with a wlan. somebdy like join my pc to see the problem? I need only configure it :)
[11:01] <bigbro> reverseblade: Yes - if that's easier.
[11:02] <MarkoKaa> hello
[11:02] <reverseblade> bigbro, My 3 files make up 4.5 GB, shall I try to write them to DVD ?
[11:02] <vorpal> maxsoftX_: what's the problem with your wlan?
[11:02] <bigbro> reverseblade: You may want to separate the ISOFS creation stage (mkisofs) and burning stage (cdrecord / dvdrecord / growisofs) stages if so, though.
[11:02] <sergevn> maxsoftX_, be more specific
[11:02] <usamahashimi> hi everyone
[11:02] <ernz> tonyyarusso> I have mozilla-mplayer now installed but firefox still appears with a gray blank where the plugin should be. Do I have to tell firefox what plugin to use?
[11:03] <reverseblade> bigbro,  I don't know what does that mean
[11:03] <maxsoftX_> vorpal it dont see my acccess point. another 2 pc work well.
[11:03] <usamahashimi> does anyone use nxclient?
[11:03] <sergevn> ernz, in your browser type: about:plugins
[11:03] <dkhan> damn php5_5 is also broken
[11:03] <sergevn> ernz, see if it's enabled.
[11:03] <dkhan> could this really be
[11:03] <philc> can I just start an arbitrary command as a daemon somehow? I have it going via ssh, but I'd like it to keep running if I get disconnected
[11:03] <philc> e.g. tail -f /var/log > myfile
[11:04] <tonyyarusso> ernz: Installing that should do it, but a) has to be default FF, not newer version, b) have to have support for the media type (see !restricted), c) have to restart Firefox
[11:04] <bigbro> reverseblade: Basically, you cannot just 'copy' files to a CD / DVD - it's a completely different filesystem. So what Linux (and every OS that burns CDs) does is it makes an image of the filesystem (often called a .iso file or .cdr file)
[11:04] <bigbro> reverseblade: It then writes this .iso image file to a DVD/CD byte for byte.
[11:04] <willskills> hey guys
[11:05] <maxsoftX_> sergevn: I need configure th eaccess point ESSID the iwconfig dont work well.  ubuntu see the wlan with eth1. (and not wlan0) the iwconfig see the eth1.
[11:05] <edgy> Sirs, how can I install a downloaded .deb so it install its dependencies automatically?
[11:05] <bigbro> philc: I suggest you use screen.
[11:05] <maxsoftX_> But dont work well.
[11:05] <tonyyarusso> philc: You could make a script run by a cronjob perhaps.
[11:05] <willskills> any advice on a nice Media/Movie player, with a Playlist manager? Repeat, etc
[11:05] <ernz> tonyyarusso> It is enabled, I have FF2.0 that came with Edgy
[11:05] <reverseblade> I see
[11:05] <willskills> what are people's favourites?
[11:05] <reverseblade> bigbro,  I got it

[11:05] <philc> bigbro: thanks!
[11:05] <usamahashimi> can anyone guide me about nxclient?
=== sandy16 is now known as sandy16aa
[11:05] <tonyyarusso> ernz: hmm
[11:05] <maxsoftX_> vorpal: sergevn now I go in internet with an ethernet (eth0) .
[11:05] <willskills> rastilin, I dont have KDE
[11:05] <HuibertGill> !nxclient
[11:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nxclient - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:05] <HuibertGill> !freenx
[11:06] <ubotu> FreeNX is advanced remote desktop technology. For more information and install instructions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
[11:06] <rastilin> willskills, so? Just install kmplayer.
[11:06] <willskills> ok
[11:06] <bigbro> reverseblade: So mkisofs can make the image 0 and if it overruns a DVD size, you don't waste a blank. When you try and burn it, the burning software (dvdrecord / growisofs) should tell you that it won't fit then, but it can't tell you that unless the image is completely created.
[11:06] <tonyyarusso> willskills: Mplayer has a gnome frontend too
[11:06] <rastilin> willskills, set it to use mplayer as the client
[11:06] <maxsoftX_> vorpal: sergevn do you like see it? I've load the pris2 module. it's a usb wlan.
[11:06] <ernz> tonyyarusso> Should I uninstall and reinstall mplayer-plugin?
[11:06] <HuibertGill> usamahashimi: did you read what ubotu just wrote?
[11:06] <tonyyarusso> ernz: Maybe.  I'm not really sure what the problem is any more.
[11:06] <willskills> ok, well guys, how do you chnage the default player on file types?
[11:07] <bigbro> reverseblade: growisofs can generate the image on the fly - writing it to DVD as it goes - so save having to have 5GB disk free each time you want to burn a DVD. It's quite clever - but as you can see has its limitations :)
[11:07] <reverseblade> and what is the official DVD size to check, 4.7 GB or 4.2 GB
=== sandy16aa is now known as sandy16
[11:07] <sergevn> maxsoftX_, vorpal, hmmm it could be anything, driver, hardware, accespoint etc etc.
[11:07] <bigbro> reverseblade: Depends on your media and your burner and your TOC. THere is no correct answer.
[11:07] <tonyyarusso> willskills: In Nautilus, right click any file of that type, select Properties, then the Open With tab.
[11:07] <tonyyarusso> (We need a better way for that, imo)
[11:07] <reverseblade> bigbro, media claims it is 4.7
[11:07] <willskills> I know that, but that doesnt change the default
[11:07] <willskills> i.e. so when you double click files
[11:07] <willskills> it just opens with that player
[11:08] <maxsoftX_> sergevn: vorpal, you like enter in my pc? I've installed hamachi also.
[11:08] <tonyyarusso> willskills: Yes it will; you have to go through properties, not the higher level Open with
[11:08] <sergevn> maxsoftX_, you have rdp enabled?
[11:08] <vorpal> maxsoftX_: had it worked previously or has it never worked beofre?
[11:08] <sergevn> maxsoftX_, i haven't worked before with hamachi, only with RPD
[11:08] <sergevn> RDP
[11:08] <willskills> ah excellent, thanks
[11:09] <willskills> sorry, just got up, obviously my head is up to reading properly yet ;)
[11:09] <willskills> not*
[11:09] <maxsoftX_> vorpal: sergevn it never worked. rdp ? yes I think. can yougive me a URL to check the rdp configuration?
[11:09] <bigbro> reverseblade: Yes - RAW - but that does not mean you'll get 4.7GB of useful data on it.
[11:09] <sergevn> maxsoftX_, it's the same protocol as Windows Remote Desktop Connection
[11:10] <sergevn> maxsoftX_, query me :)
[11:10] <maxsoftX_> sergevn: I dont have a public ip address for this I use hamachi. install hamachi it's very easy. please try. I've installled it in 5 minutes and I dont know linux.
[11:10] <maxsoftX_> sergevn: please query me cause I'm not registered so I cant :) thank you.

[11:26] <vorpal> say ctrl-X to exit then try again
[11:27] <noiesmo> raphink, sudo apt-get install --fix-missing
[11:27] <dawkirs1> vorpal: Does exactly the same :/
[11:27] <tonyyarusso> ernz: Tried the mailing list or forums yet?
[11:27] <noiesmo> raphink, if i have upgrade or install problem with apt-get and it rocmends it

[11:28] <ernz> tonyyarusso> See why people turn to scripted installers? :)
[11:28] <dawkirs1> vorpal: Sorry, there it goes. So I should get rid of the # before universe?
[11:28] <lukemh> ive nearly got everything set up just as i want
[11:29] <raphink> noiesmo: because I have a program that seeds the --option to apt-get, which requires options of the form of APT::Get::Fix-Missing
[11:29] <vorpal> dawkirs1: any  lines that say universe in them
[11:29] <tonyyarusso> ernz: I can see the appeal, but I've also seen what happens when they don't work right.

[11:41] <flo|va-nu-pied> what's the correct syntaxe to hold a package version with apt ?
[11:41] <dawkirst> vorpal: And I learned something new. But why doesn't Ubuntu "officially" support irb?
[11:42] <vorpal> dawkirst: cause you don't need irb to have a normal full running system. You can imagine a desktop with out irb but not with out a wordprocessor or an mp3player
[11:42] <meshyf> Anyone know how to set up Last.fm radio player right? I can't get it to show artist, album or track info
[11:43] <flo|va-nu-pied> i found aptitude hold my_package but seem to doesn't work with apt
[11:43] <SeyToN> ubuntu hasnt have the packages of glib and libpng :S
[11:44] <vorpal> dawkirst: just cause it says its not supported doesn't mean that it is. If there is a major security problem it will still get fixed, it's just they don't garuntee it

[12:19] <HamsDa> I have problems mounting my USB-Drive! It says "Can't read Superblock" if I try to moun it. can somebody tell me, what is wrong?
[12:19] <Dylanp> How can i restart my apache server?
[12:19] <frafra> I've installed the lastest ati driver (8.31.5) for my ati radeon mobility x1100. all works. I've try to enable aiglx but beryl needs composite extension. If I enable this option, dri is disabled :) If I don't enable this option, dri works. So, I've try Xgl, but when I load gnome-session, it freeze, but I can move the mouse or switch terms. Who can help me?
[12:19] <chable> works
[12:21] <frafra> i'm on edgy eft
[12:21] <chable> well
[12:21] <chable> the icons on desktop
[12:21] <chable> are arranged growing bigger
[12:21] <chable> how do i keep the same size ?
[12:22] <NET||abuse> hmm, reading a few articles in linux mag/linux format.. going on about the ntfs-tools packages,, is there any kind of a chkdisk application that can do ntfs file structure checking rather than just disk surface scans etc..
[12:22] <NET||abuse> would be really usful to have a livecd that can do that
[12:23] <NET||abuse> i did also see captive that loadsup the ntfs.sys file from the windows drive to use the native windows driver, but still i don't know if there is any way to scan the ntfs file system
[12:24] <bigbro> reverseblade: lo?
[12:24] <reverseblade> well I have done it and I can verify the data has been written to the cd
[12:24] <NET||abuse> i also learned from the article that ntfs doesn't stand for something like "Network Terminal FS" from its beginnings in windows NT,, but instead actually  stands for "New Technology File System" ... what a gay name..
[12:25] <HamsDa> can somebody help me mounting my USB? it says "Can't read superblock", if I try to mount it =(
[12:25] <gebruiker> NET||abuse, what do you think ext3 stands for?
[12:25] <NET||abuse> HamsDa, i have a 160GB Western Digital usb drive at home that won't mount in linux either... seems to mount in windows, but then i tried to copy a movie onto it,, and it went poop..
[12:25] <reverseblade> well but when I do it from the machine I burnt, I can't verify it. when  I do ls /media/cdrom0  it gives 0 files
[12:26] <pty> NET||abuse: the NT in Windows NT stands for new technology
[12:26] <NET||abuse> ext3 is third extended file systemm,, dunno if ext means anything else
[12:26] <kaptengu> I have a external harddrive with both LAN and USB. When the computer that is attached to this disk with USB is on, I can't use the LAN. Therefore, can I some way mount this drive from another computer on the same mountpoint although it can be reached directly through LAN sometimes, and sometimes through the other computer.
[12:26] <HamsDa> my USB drive is working on windows and I'm sure, it will work on linux too, but I can't mount it Oo
[12:27] <NET||abuse> i was always under the impression that NT stood for Network Terminal
[12:27] <nothlit> NET||abuse, lol thats what you thought it stood for? btw captive is deprecated, you're supposed to use ntfs-3g
[12:27] <nothlit> !ntfs-3g | NET||abuse
[12:27] <ubotu> NET||abuse: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution.

[12:27] <chable> hihi
[12:28] <chable> working
[12:28] <chable> sorry
[12:28] <NET||abuse> we shouldn't deprecate anything while the replacement app is still in BETA surely?
[12:28] <Shan`> how do i format a drive?
[12:28] <nothlit> NET||abuse, beta doesn't mean anything,look at gmail and flickr
[12:28] <NET||abuse> harhar
[12:28] <nothlit> NET||abuse, ntfs-3g is better.
[12:28] <bigbro> reverseblade: I assume that your DVD is mounted as /dev/cdrom0
[12:28] <NET||abuse> Beta is just a marketing word for them
[12:29] <reverseblade> bigbro,  /it is /dev/hdc but also I can access it /media/cdrom0
[12:29] <reverseblade> bigbro, using ubuntu, couldn't figure out its convention
[12:29] <NET||abuse> anyway.. i need to get my courier working right :) tried creating a mailbox for myself on my domain,, didn't work :(
[12:29] <pty> its also like a safety net; if they go oopsie and lose your data they can say 'well, sir, its still in beta'

[12:30] <NET||abuse> Shan`, you wiping your windows :) nice
[12:30] <Shan`> :)
[12:30] <HamsDa> bigbro: my USB Drive isn't mounted on /media
[12:30] <Shan`> need more space
[12:30] <pty> easiest using gparted ?
[12:30] <NET||abuse> you could just use ntfsresize and shrink it down to minimum
[12:30] <reverseblade> bigbro, though when I am writing to the burner I used /dev/hdc
[12:30] <Shan`> and after i got my Unreal Tournament GOTY working opn lkinux.,.. i didnt need it anymore
[12:30] <HamsDa> I don't see any auto-mount in there
[12:30] <Shan`> lol

[01:16] <h08817> after i get in there
[01:16] <h08817> but i need internet first
[01:16] <h08817> so how can i get ndiswrapper on there?
[01:16] <jrib> h08817: if this is a fresh install, why not just install dapper or edgy?

[01:17] <h08817> im just using it for personal interest and to learn a little about linux
[01:18] <jrib> h08817: ok, well the ndiswrapper stuff is on the cd.  The wiki page ubotu gave you should have more detailed instructions
[01:18] <h08817> ok thanks
[01:18] <ailean> is there a data counter at all to count how much you have downloaded in a particular month?
[01:19] <gotit> wats gcc
[01:20] <milde> www.gcc.gnu.org/
[01:21] <gotit> its not a correct add
[01:22] <h08817> well gcc is a compiler
[01:22] <gotit> and it does not tell wat it is
[01:22] <gotit> oh ok

[01:24] <vorpal> DEAR GOD. somebody save me. I just talked some guy thru editing thier sources.list in spanish. I only just speak spanish. I'm going mad!!!!
[01:24] <Doow> gotit: gcc is the gnu compiler collection, a set of opensource compilers and linkers for a couple of different languages
[01:24] <gebruiker> gcc is not a 'set'
[01:25] <gebruiker> gcc is the gnu c compiler
[01:25] <Doow> gebruiker: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection
[01:25] <gebruiker> so? wikipedia is correct?
[01:25] <gebruiker> only fools regard wikipedia as trustworthy
[01:26] <Doow> gebruiker: http://gcc.gnu.org/
[01:26] <Doow> the official page (linked from wikipedia)
[01:26] <gebruiker> apt-cache show gcc
[01:26] <gebruiker> that's all you need
[01:26] <h08817> how do i install something from a cd that is a deb file
[01:26] <Doow> gebruiker: yes, because apt is more trustworthy than the official homepage?
[01:27] <h08817> !deb
[01:27] <ubotu> deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[01:27] <gebruiker> Doow, what are you talking dude? read man gcc
[01:27] <NET||abuse> hmm, ok, i am not getting the courier configu right,,
[01:27] <gebruiker> where does it say 'a set' ???
[01:27] <chrismo> wikipedia is correct
[01:27] <Doow> ok, it says collection
[01:27] <chrismo> compiler collection
[01:27] <Doow> gebruiker: so what?
[01:27] <NET||abuse> i've been following the howtoforge article on setup here http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06_p5
[01:28] <NET||abuse> now, i have completed the setup according to th instructions here, i've configured postfix, but i get maildaemon errors when i try to send mail saying relay denied
[01:28] <gebruiker> Doow, it says : "The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective" does that mean that GCC is a collection of software?
[01:28] <gebruiker> damn fucktard can't read
[01:28] <h08817> how do u install something from a cd if you do not have gnome?
[01:28] <Doow> gebruiker: I feel for you
[01:28] <gebruiker> it says THE GNU COMPILER
[01:28] <lemonsCC> How can i message a user through ssh if they dont have terminal open?
[01:29] <gebruiker> jeejs can't even read
[01:29] <Doow> gebruiker: yeah, and USA has nothing to do with america because it stands for united states?
[01:29] <gnomefreak> now i will ask all of you to take teh gcc topic to #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:30] <Doow> gnomefreak: sorry
[01:30] <chrismo> take it gnu channel
[01:30] <chrismo> that would be funny
[01:30] <Doow> chrismo: haha
[01:30] <lemonsCC> How can I message a user through ssh if they dont have terminal open?
[01:31] <lemonsCC> linpopup isnt an option as this is from a mac/windows
[01:31] <h08817> I have a basic install of linux and i was wondering how can i install something from the cd to my installation?
[01:31] <lemonsCC> what do you want to install?
[01:31] <h08817> i just want to get ndiswrapper
[01:31] <h08817> so i can internet of course
[01:32] <h08817> but i chose a server install so its just the bare minimum (small hd)
[01:32] <lemonsCC> h08817: sudo apt-get ndiswrapper
[01:32] <lemonsCC> and it may ask for the CD
[01:32] <h08817> thats if i have internet
[01:32] <h08817> o ok
[01:32] <h08817> hopefully

[01:42] <Hannibal> Hello. Recently, I did the following to my laptop, which was then running Ubuntu Dapper. First I installed Xubuntu, succesfully. Then I tried to upgrade the machine to Edgy (using update-manager -c). It failed to replace Samba correctly, and then hung up when trying to replace some XFCE package while XFCE was running. I rebooted the machine, and attempted to finish the update.
[01:42] <Hannibal> This sort of worked, but it's still complaining that samba, xubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop are not satisfied because xorg is not installed
[01:42] <Hannibal> this is odd, because I can start both ubuntu and xubuntu fine.
[01:43] <Hannibal> (and get a working X and Gnome/XFCE)
[01:43] <vorpal> does anyone know how to install the windows font "tahoma"?
[01:43] <screechingcat> vorpal: isnt it part of msttcorefonts ?
[01:43] <Hannibal> anyway, recently I did something *really* dumb - I broke the ethernet port, so now my only way out is my wireless card, which doesn't seem to work very well on Edgy anymore (it has an Atheros G chip)
[01:43] <nightsky> hello people. following issue: using libnss-ldap and libpam-ldap to authenticate users against an ldap-server. using a crypt-hash in the ldaptree all works fine. using md5 and the user gets rejected. this works when the client machine is using gentoo but does not if it's ubuntu 6.10. does anyone have the slightest idea why this might be? am i missing something trivial here?
[01:43] <Hannibal> assuming I can get internet back on the machine, how would you advise I try to fix the broken dependencies?
[01:44] <intelikey> can anyone tell me about setting up a usb all-N-1 scanner ?   the printer works fine but sane says no device found ???
[01:44] <hhyyjj163_> !kubuntu
[01:44] <ubotu> Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
[01:44] <intelikey> Hannibal sudo apt-get install -f
[01:44] <kling0n> !packaging
[01:44] <ubotu> The packaging guide is at http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/index.html - Other developer resources are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperResources
[01:44] <vorpal> screechingcat: well, i'm acting as go between here, but some guy on ubuntu-es just installed msttcorefonts and it appanetly didn't contain it
[01:44] <hhyyjj163_> !xubuntu
[01:44] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[01:45] <vorpal> is there anything you have to do after downloading corefonts?
[01:45] <intelikey> !fonts
[01:45] <ubotu> Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "msttcorefonts" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". No fonts in MPlayer? see !MPlayer
[01:45] <lemonsCC> How can I message a user through ssh if they dont have terminal open?
[01:46] <hhyyjj163_> !ssh
[01:46] <ubotu> SSH is the Secure SHell protocol. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto for usage. Putty is a nice SSH client for Windows; it can be found at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
[01:46] <intelikey> lemonsCC you loged into their box ?
[01:46] <intelikey> lemonsCC try wall
[01:46] <lemonsCC> i am logged into my user on the same box as them via ssh
[01:46] <Hannibal> intelikey: thanks, I'll try that. From memory, I tried running apt-get update -f and that didn't "work", in the sense that it tried updating lots of things, but failed to actually fix the broken dependencies. Is that expected?
[01:47] <lemonsCC> intelikey wall only seemed to display text if terminal was open
[01:47] <intelikey> lemonsCC mmmm it used to send to X also
[01:47] <ThePub> Kate wouldn't happen to have a feature similar to Scribes Templates would it?
[01:48] <intelikey> anyone know sane or scanner setup ?
[01:48] <lemonsCC> intelikey do they need admin rights? or anything special?
[01:48] <hhyyjj163_> !scanner
[01:48] <ubotu> Scanning software: XSane, the gimp, Kooka. For instructions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ScanningHowTo and to see supported hardware: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsScanners
[01:48] <intelikey> lemonsCC ah yes wall needs admin to send to all
[01:48] <h08817> hey lemonsCC
[01:49] <lemonsCC> intelikey i mean to recieve
[01:49] <intelikey> lemonsCC no
[01:49] <lemonsCC> h08817 yes?
[01:49] <h08817> that did not work but i did find the ndiswrapper-utils on the cd
[01:49] <lemonsCC> intelikey maybe sudo ..... | wall
[01:49] <lemonsCC> did that install?
[01:49] <h08817> its a deb file so can't i just install it directly from there with some command?
[01:49] <intelikey> lemonsCC maybe echo 'blah ' | sudo wall
[01:50] <lemonsCC> intelikey trying it now
[01:50] <yakumo> hi im upgradng my ubuntu 6.06 to 6.10 not using apt, anyone familiar???
[01:50] <ttyfscker> lemonsCC:: you trying to send messages to people?
[01:50] <ThePub> yakumo: so you're using an install CD?
[01:50] <ttyfscker> lemonsCC:: use the write command if so
[01:50] <intelikey> yakumo sounds like it should keep you busy for a while.
[01:50] <yakumo> is it posible???
[01:51] <lemonsCC> ttyyfsker write only works with terminal open....it needs a tty
[01:51] <ThePub> yakumo: well sure, download the install cd.  it's going to use apt though ;)
[01:51] <rajiv_nair> willskills: th3_d4r3d3vi1 here:D
[01:51] <ragnar_123> hi there!
[01:51] <rajiv_nair> :D
[01:51] <rajiv_nair> back on dapper :-<
[01:52] <h08817> how do u install deb files?
[01:52] <ragnar_123> cool.. or at least better than win xp
[01:52] <lemonsCC> ttyfscker unless you know how to open a terminal on their session
[01:52] <ttyfscker> h08817:: sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
[01:52] <rajiv_nair> wouldnt double clicking work??
[01:52] <rajiv_nair> :d
[01:52] <h08817> ah the -i I kept wondering that
[01:52] <Lardarse> hi... i'm trying to find a link to the torrent file for 6.10, but there doesn't seem to be one there. Does anyone know if the torrent is still running?
[01:52] <ThePub> h08817: and it wouldn't hurt to read the dpkg man page.
[01:52] <yakumo> <ThePub>i download the the desktop cd 6.10, but i thought i could not upgrade using that... so i try using the deistribution upgrade..
[01:53] <h08817> yeah true well im using a crap version at this moment
[01:53] <h08817> of ubuntu
[01:53] <h08817> im building it up from server
[01:53] <h08817> so i dont have gnome yet
[01:53] <rajiv_nair> ohhh
[01:53] <lemonsCC> h08817 sorry to i forgot about you if you want more info about dpkg use "man dpkg"
[01:53] <lemonsCC> h008817 use fluxbox if your Hd is that small
[01:53] <yakumo> <ThePub>but i use the destribution upgrade to upgrade my 6.06 to 6.10
[01:53] <h08817> whats that?
[01:54] <lemonsCC> h08817 i have ubuntu + fluxbox installed at 788mb
[01:54] <ttyfscker> lightweight full featured window manager
[01:54] <h08817> and how do i do that?
[01:54] <h08817> !fluxbox
[01:54] <ubotu> fluxbox is a lightweight and responsive window manager for GNU/Linux. For how to set it up and more information see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fluxbox
[01:54] <ttyfscker> sudo apt-get install fluxbox
[01:54] <lemonsCC> http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/
[01:54] <h08817> well i can't install crap yet
[01:54] <h08817> until i get my ndiswrapper so bbs
[01:54] <lemonsCC> lol k
[01:55] <lemonsCC> intelikey:  sudo did nothing still no message to X
[01:55] <Lardarse> any1?
[01:56] <lemonsCC> Is it possible to open a terminal in someone elses session?
[01:56] <lemonsCC> through ssh?
[01:56] <ThePub> yakumo: just grab the edgy cd and run with it, it won't touch your ~/ directory but take care of everything else if you run in-place
[01:56] <lemonsCC> lardarse yes?
[01:56] <Lardarse> <Lardarse> hi... i'm trying to find a link to the torrent file for 6.10, but there doesn't seem to be one there. Does anyone know if the torrent is still running?
[01:56] <lemonsCC> should be running
[01:57] <ttyfscker> why use a torrent now?
[01:57] <lemonsCC> faster
[01:57] <ttyfscker> i doubt that
[01:57] <Lardarse> lemonsCC: where's the torrent link?
[01:57] <ThePub> lemonsCC: what do you mean?  open a session?
[01:57] <yakumo> <ThePub>umm example i have the official cd 5.10 deliver to me and i still have 5.04 install, can i install it without formating my pc. or without using the internet for upgrade
[01:57] <lemonsCC> thepub I want to be able to message users through ssh... wall and write need terminal open
[01:58] <ttyfscker> a torrent will probably kick off around 8k/sec and gradually work its way up to 150k/sec.. the repos will most likely give you a steady 200 - 300k/sec....
[01:58] <ThePub> lemonsCC: like open an X application onto another terminal?  <application> -display <ip>:<screen>.<subscreen>
[01:58] <Hannibal> hrm. What do I do if "apt-get install -f" hangs on "waiting for headers" ?
[01:58] <lemonsCC> lardarse:: http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu//6.06/ubuntu-6.06.1-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
[01:58] <Hannibal> I can ping all the servers in my sources.list file fine...
[01:58] <ThePub> lemonsCC: oh, lol, you can notify people.. hmm, what was that command
[01:58] <Lardarse> lemonsCC: 6.10 ?
[01:58] <lemonsCC> yes
[01:58] <lemonsCC> and the http download is cruising at 588kb/s right now
[01:58] <lemonsCC> use that =P
[01:59] <nolimitsoya> lemonsCC, the link isnot for a 6.10 torrent
[01:59] <lemonsCC> lol my bad
[01:59] <ttyfscker> su -s     echo "some text"|wall
[01:59] <Lardarse> lemonsCC: you waake yet? :-P
[01:59] <ttyfscker> sudo -s     echo "some text"|wall
[01:59] <Lardarse> awake*
[01:59] <ThePub> ttyfscker: thank you :)
[01:59] <lemonsCC> lardarse nope
[02:00] <lemonsCC> http://carroll.cac.psu.edu/pub/linux/distributions/ubuntu-releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
[02:00] <ThePub> it's too bad kde doesn't have a text editor like Scribes :)
[02:00] <lemonsCC> thats the one!
[02:00] <lemonsCC> or the live cd
[02:00] <lemonsCC> http://carroll.cac.psu.edu/pub/linux/distributions/ubuntu-releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
[02:01] <ttyfscker> just download it directly from http
[02:02] <lemonsCC> thepub:  still nothing at the recieving end
[02:02] <lemonsCC> agreed:  right now this link is dling at 600kb/s about
[02:02] <ttyfscker> despite the common intentions of torrents.. its still slower in the  long run, unless the servers are being hammered.. there are no updates today for edgy, and no new releases.. so you should get pretty reliable speeds from the main mirrors directly ;)

[02:03] <willskills> Wewt =)
[02:03] <willskills> my WoW runs great
[02:03] <willskills> :D
[02:03] <lemonsCC> lol grats
[02:03] <lemonsCC> on ubuntu?
[02:03] <rajiv_nair> gotta go
[02:03] <rajiv_nair> bye
[02:03] <willskills> figured it out, was some old GFX options I had enabled while running on windows
[02:03] <willskills> turned them off
[02:04] <willskills> and now my framerate is stupid! :DDDDD
[02:04] <lemonsCC> My Rage128 would die if it saw WoW
[02:04] <tyrone> leonsCC: nothing easier than wow on ubuntu
[02:04] <tyrone> lemonsCC
[02:04] <nolimitsoya> ThePub, is scribes in the repos?
[02:05] <lemonsCC> can linpopup be used through CLI?
[02:05] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: here is a deb for it http://www.youmortals.com/ubuntu/packages/
[02:05] <ThePub> nolimitsoya: no, h08817: "man dpkg"
[02:06] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: its not in repos so i uploaded my deb for it
[02:06] <ThePub> nolimitsoya: oops, no: http://scribes.sourceforge.net/
[02:06] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, theres an official deb on the main site, but thank you :)
[02:06] <lemonsCC> swiftfox needs to release a pentium MMX version=P
[02:06] <Tomcat_> lemonsCC: linpopup uses the CLI itself.... it does some samba calls afaik.
[02:07] <lemonsCC> samba is no problem
=== _steve is now known as steve
[02:07] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: i know there is
[02:07] <ThePub> it's amazing.. looking over Kate it seems it'll do everything from type text to slice bread.. but it doesn't have a simple feature like Templates.
[02:07] <Dimensions> hi guys ... how do  i install Windows along with my Ubuntu where i have just single partition how do i resize my partition as i dont want to lose any important data from it its my office laptop
[02:07] <lemonsCC> ahh the joy of linux =)
[02:08] <ThePub> lemonsCC: all the troubles and none of the gains of Windows?
[02:08] <Ben2004uk> hey guys, how long is the PPC architecture going to be supported ??? Thinking about getting a new MacBook and using my iBook as a pure ubuntu laptop but are the new versions of Ubuntu still going to be compatiable
[02:08] <lemonsCC> windows after ubuntu is a PITA AFAIK
[02:08] <nolimitsoya> Dimensions, the install will help you. just be sure to have a full backup before you do anything
[02:08] <lemonsCC> ThePub:  I hate OoO for that reason...no templates!!
[02:08] <nolimitsoya> lemonsCC, not realy. reconfiguring grub is quite painless
[02:08] <lemonsCC> ThePub: they are all amatuerish
[02:08] <Dimensions> Install of windows ? nolimitsoya ?
[02:09] <lemonsCC> Dimensions do you have an Ubuntu LiveCD?
[02:09] <Dimensions> because i know with ubuntu installation u can resize but how do i do it with Windows one
[02:09] <ThePub> lemonsCC: scribes templates are more like interactive ways to insert text snippets interactively.  not document templates.
[02:09] <Dimensions> yes i do ...
[02:09] <nolimitsoya> Dimensions, no, the ubuntu installer will help you resize partitions
[02:09] <nolimitsoya> windows is as dumb as ever :P
[02:09] <lemonsCC> nolimitsoya ubuntu is already installed
[02:10] <lemonsCC> ThePub I heard template and thought OoO and its lack of
[02:10] <nolimitsoya> lemonsCC, then the ubuntu installer can still be used to resize :)
[02:10] <Dimensions> nolimitsoya:  any idea how can one copy saved mails from Evolution i have like 500 + mails stored in it
[02:10] <Lardarse> lemonsCC: in answer to the question why use a torrent: it's because a torrent is generally faster than relying on 1 website to download it from
[02:10] <ThePub> just go into gparted and resize the current partition, then install windows.  after that boot back off your livecd and rerun grub from the linux partition to reinstall it into MBR
[02:10] <lemonsCC> nolimitsoya news to me i always use Gparted
[02:10] <Lardarse> + it gives em a use for my upsstream bandwidth afterwards :-)
[02:10] <Lardarse> me*
[02:10] <nolimitsoya> Dimensions, if you are looking for a backup solution just use tar
[02:10] <nolimitsoya> lemonsCC, the ubuntu installer uses g-/parted
[02:11] <Dimensions> nolimitsoya:  tar is like zipping files how can i use that with Evolution saved mails i donno where it keeps them on hdd ...
[02:11] <ubunt1> !grub
[02:11] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:11] <nolimitsoya> Dimensions, should be in ~
[02:11] <lemonsCC> nolimitsoya..I use alternate discs so i didnt realize
[02:11] <nolimitsoya> Dimensions, look in the hidden folders for something like .evolution, and tar it
[02:11] <willskills> mm
[02:12] <willskills> not so good = my disk is maing a funny noise from time to time
[02:12] <willskills> it's 10,000rpm raptor
[02:12] <willskills> making*
[02:12] <nolimitsoya> willskills, backup!
[02:12] <willskills> good idea.
[02:12] <willskills> but
[02:12] <lemonsCC> lardarse did you end up getting it started dling?
[02:12] <willskills> rofl
[02:12] <willskills> its not my disk
[02:13] <Lardarse> lemonsCC: the torrent? yeah
[02:13] <lemonsCC> xdrive offers free 5gig...=)
[02:13] <nolimitsoya> willskills, there are no 'buts'. sudo apt-get install hubackup && hubackup
[02:13] <willskills> its a pair of shite speakers I forgot I had plugged in :>
[02:13] <Lardarse> gave up on a local mirror after only gettign 3 megabytes in about 3 minutes...
[02:13] <lemonsCC> lol
[02:13] <Dimensions> How can one use gparted for resizing disk as when i open it ... it just shows it as read only no resize option
[02:13] <lemonsCC> lardarse i was getting 600kb/s!
[02:13] <tx22> guys, I'm looking for a nice (easy) distro to test out XGL. I've heard of sabayon because it is a live CD and has the nvidia driver built in. Is this the best choice for ease fo use?
[02:13] <Lardarse> lei'm in the UK...
[02:13] <lemonsCC> lardarse which mirror?
[02:13] <Lardarse> oops
[02:13] <Lardarse> University of Kent
[02:14] <lemonsCC> meh use american server =)
[02:14] <lemonsCC> change the locale later
[02:14] <Lardarse> i can only get 140 a second at most from eastt coast america
[02:14] <Lardarse> a40k*
[02:14] <Lardarse> grrrr...
[02:14] <Lardarse> 140k
[02:14] <lemonsCC> what is the torrent getting?
[02:14] <Lardarse> 400
[02:14] <ThePub> Google Earth is so much nicer with an accelerated X server :)
[02:14] <Dimensions> ThePub:  how do u use gparted ... it shows partitions as read only resize is disabled
[02:14] <lemonsCC> when you can accelerate!
[02:15] <lemonsCC> I can't
[02:15] <lemonsCC> Dimensions just pop in the liveCd and reboot
[02:15] <ThePub> not all of use run 15-year-old video cards I suppose :D
[02:15] <lemonsCC> open gparted in there, same thing less steps
[02:15] <lemonsCC> hey its 14y/o
[02:16] <GoG> How play in Ubuntu Counter-Strike 1.6 STEAM ?
[02:16] <ThePub> Dimensions: lemonsCC made the best suggestion if you only have 1 partition.  far less work that way :)
[02:16] <Dimensions> thanks lemonsCC got the point to resize it i had done it once on another lappy while one lap data was vanished lol jus a bit scared of it
[02:16] <GoG> who play in Ubuntu Counter-Strike 1.6 STEAM ?
[02:16] <prestosd> Hey all!
[02:17] <lemonsCC> dimensions just dont go crazy...a 1gig ubuntu partition will result in lost data
[02:17] <ragnar_123> !hi | prestosd
[02:17] <ubotu> prestosd: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[02:17] <lemonsCC> 10gigs+ your good
[02:17] <prestosd> I can't access my windows HD in linux (ubuntu 6.10) can someone help me mount it?
[02:17] <lemonsCC> eek ntfs?
[02:17] <prestosd> ragnar_123, thanks for the hi!
[02:17] <lemonsCC> prestosd read and write to it?
[02:17] <ragnar_123> prestosd: thank the bot :D
[02:17] <GoG> who play in Ubuntu Counter-Strike 1.6 STEAM ?
[02:17] <prestosd> lol
[02:17] <prestosd> yes
[02:17] <prestosd> read and write
[02:18] <prestosd> and i want to mount it as windows
[02:18] <prestosd> (the name of the mountpoint)
[02:18] <scraliontis> hi
[02:18] <Dimensions> okay guys goin to do it with live cd but besides that just to have knowledge abt gparted ... whats use of it in ubuntu installed version can we also use it for any functions like partitions etc or its just for information there
[02:18] <pty> GoG: CS1.6 is the only reason I still have an XP partition
[02:18] <lemonsCC> writing to ntfs is very experimental and case corrupt data like a mofo
[02:18] <lemonsCC> can*
[02:19] <prestosd> lemonsCC, no its not a ntfs! its windows 98se
[02:19] <lemonsCC> fat32?
[02:19] <prestosd> lemonsCC, yup
[02:19] <lemonsCC> nice!
[02:19] <lemonsCC> automount?
[02:19] <prestosd> lol
[02:19] <prestosd> I know!
[02:19] <prestosd> automount?
[02:19] <scraliontis> i am having problems with my new wifi usb adapter, when i plug it in, network mamanger starts and starts using 100% cpu, and crashes, whats going on.
[02:19] <prestosd> whats that
[02:19] <ThePub> Dimensions: parted (gparted is a frontend) is specifically for partition stuff.  info as well as creation/use/etc.  Just be careful.. messing with partitions is a surefire way to lose data (as others have said)
[02:20] <lemonsCC> prestosd sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_backup << this will save lots of grief
[02:20] <prestosd> ?
[02:20] <prestosd> ?
[02:20] <scraliontis> i mean ubuntu crashes entirly, and i have to restart
[02:20] <lemonsCC> open terminal and paste this in it
[02:20] <lemonsCC> sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_backup
[02:20] <Dimensions> ThePub: but when we open it in installed ubuntu i dont get resize option active
[02:21] <prestosd> k
[02:21] <lemonsCC> wait shouldnt a fat32 be automatically detected and mounted?
[02:21] <HeathenDan> whoa, a xorg update in synaptic... is it safe?
[02:21] <prestosd> lemonsCC, dont think so
[02:21] <ThePub> Dimensions: that's because you only have one partition, right?  Your one partition is the mounted and ACTIVE partition.  You cannot modify an active partition.
[02:21] <prestosd> lemonsCC, maybe, but i cant find it
[02:21] <lemonsCC> prestosd mine was...
[02:21] <prestosd> lemonsCC, i ran the command
[02:21] <lemonsCC> where do you want it to mount to?
[02:21] <Dimensions> ahhan Thanks ThePub ... got the point ...
[02:21] <scraliontis> can anybody help
[02:22] <Dimensions> and thanks guys ...
[02:22] <prestosd> lemonsCC, umm how about /media/windows
[02:22] <ThePub> Dimensions: by rebotting to the livecd you are using the CDs memory partition and therefore able to edit the partiion on your disk.
[02:22] <prestosd> lemonsCC, so the HD is know as "windows"
[02:22] <lemonsCC> sudo mkdir /media/windows
[02:22] <prestosd> k
[02:22] <prestosd> done
[02:22] <lemonsCC> now sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[02:23] <prestosd> loading.....
[02:23] <gpfreitas> Hi everybody. I'd like to know how to change my usplash screen. I have installed kubuntu-desktop just out of curiosity, but now (after uninstalling everything kubuntu-related, I guess), the usplash is from kubuntu, not ubuntu.
[02:23] <Dimensions> ThePub:  when we boot into live cd and use gparted it will use the one from the cd or the one installed with ubuntu on HDD ?
[02:23] <prestosd> done
[02:23] <prestosd> lemonsCC, now what?
[02:23] <HuibertGill> !usplash > gpfreitas
[02:23] <lemonsCC> do you know the mount point?
[02:23] <ThePub> Dimensions: one on the cd of course.  That's immaterial though.
[02:23] <scraliontis> thanks for not helping
[02:23] <lemonsCC> ex:/dev/hda1
[02:24] <prestosd> lemonsCC,  ?????? ex????
[02:24] <gpfreitas> HuibertGill: what do you mean?
[02:24] <me3> wow
[02:24] <me3> irssi is awesome
[02:24] <HuibertGill> I thought ubotu knew about usplash
[02:24] <HuibertGill> !usplash
[02:24] <ubotu> usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[02:25] <lemonsCC> Anyone know how to find the mount point of a HD?
[02:25] <gpfreitas> Thanks ubotu!
[02:25] <gpfreitas> and HuibertGill
[02:25] <me3> hey can i ask i want to set up a irc server on my home network
[02:25] <HuibertGill> gpfreitas: there, you see, :-)
[02:25] <GoG> pty ... yes me too :P
[02:25] <prestosd> lemonsCC, lol
[02:25] <prestosd> lemonsCC, I think I already know it
[02:25] <GoG> in WIndwos i only have STEAM :P
[02:25] <zigford> lemonsCC: type "mount"
[02:25] <prestosd> lemonsCC, or i can find it with gparted
[02:25] <GoG> and some games
[02:25] <me3> what sit eh best and easiest on  for ubuntu or in my case xubuntu
[02:25] <lemonsCC> prestosd got that?  lemonsCC: type "mount"
[02:26] <prestosd> lemonsCC, in the console?
[02:26] <lemonsCC> thats in terminal, yes
[02:26] <me3> what is the best and easiest one for ubuntu or in my case xubuntu
[02:26] <prestosd> lemonsCC, kk
[02:26] <prestosd> wow
[02:26] <lemonsCC> it should show your drive in there somewhere
[02:26] <Hannibal> ok, apparently I'm suffering from a very weird configuration problem on my laptop running Ubuntu. When trying to connect to the ubuntu archive servers, it tries to do so using ipv6
[02:26] <prestosd> lots of mounts
[02:26] <Hannibal> this fails
[02:26] <prestosd> and junk...
[02:26] <pty> GoG: i had Steam up and running in linux last year; it worked 'ok' but it wasn't that stable and i couldnt get my frame rate as high as it was on XP.  Things may have changed since I tried but I've not had chance to experiment recently
[02:26] <prestosd> lemonsCC, now what?
[02:27] <prestosd> lemonsCC, i have the info
[02:27] <lemonsCC> looking for vfat
[02:27] <Hannibal> telnetting to the host also tries to use ipv6, and hence fails
[02:27] <Hannibal> telnetting to the ipv4 ip works fine, however.
[02:27] <lemonsCC> dont paste it in here....thats flooding
[02:27] <Hannibal> I don't suppose someone knows how I would fix such a situation (or indeed, what the hell is going on?)
[02:27] <prestosd> lol
[02:27] <prestosd> i know
[02:27] <rajiv_nair> hehe
[02:27] <floating_> I read from w3m faq, that it uses xv as default image viewer. I dont get anything if I type xv in terminal. My problem is that when I try use the "view image" with w3m, nothing happens. Any ideas?
[02:28] <prestosd> lemonsCC, i dont see a vfat
[02:28] <lemonsCC> you said you could find it using gparted?
[02:28] <me3> Hannibal: ipv6 is not compatable with old network cards
[02:28] <prestosd> lemonsCC, the windows partition is on a whole other HD and it looks like that mount command only shows the linux one
[02:28] <Hannibal> me3: fine, how do I kill it? :)
[02:28] <prestosd> lemonsCC, ill look in gparted.....
[02:29] <me3> now thats the magical question
[02:29] <me3> i dont know Hannibal
[02:29] <me3> !ipv6
[02:29] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[02:29] <me3> but that will tell you
[02:30] <prestosd> lemonsCC, go to our channel...
[02:30] <Hannibal> me3: aha. So then I don't suppose you know whether it's bad that I followed the dapper method outlined below that one? :)
[02:31] <me3> lmao
[02:31] <me3> not sure
[02:31] <lemonsCC> which is?
[02:31] <me3> dont seea  problem
[02:31] <Hannibal> well, we'll soon find out!
[02:31] <Hannibal> lemonsCC: do roughly the same by editing /etc/modprobe.d/aliases
[02:31] <me3> but if you have done it and there is a problem do the other one then
[02:31] <Hannibal> instead of bad_list
[02:32] <ThePub> floating_: where'd you get a w3m file?
[02:32] <gpfreitas> ubotu, HuibertGill: That webpage had no instructions on how to actually change your usplash.
[02:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about HuibertGill: That webpage had no instructions on how to actually change your usplash. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:33] <gpfreitas> Ah.
[02:33] <gpfreitas> Well, I'd like to revert back to the default usplash.
[02:33] <ThePub> gpfreitas: ubotu is a bot :)
[02:33] <gpfreitas> It sounds simple, but I don't know what to do.
[02:33] <lemonsCC> prestosd join #mount
[02:33] <gpfreitas> ThePub: I just noticed. ;)
[02:33] <prestosd> k
[02:33] <me3> hey can i ask i want to set up a irc server on my home network
[02:33] <prestosd> join #mount
[02:34] <me3> what is the best and easiest one for ubuntu or in my case xubuntu
[02:34] <lemonsCC>    / in front
[02:34] <prestosd> ?
[02:34] <prestosd> i cant find a channel called mount
[02:34] <lemonsCC> to join a new channel type /join #mount
[02:34] <prestosd> lemonsCC, k
[02:35] <me3> lemonsCC:  do you know much about apt-get of irc servers
[02:35] <me3> not irc clients
[02:36] <lesshaste> I get thousands of messages ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:521:(snd_pcm_hw_prepare) SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_PREPARE failed: Device or resource busy when I use skype for example
[02:36] <lesshaste> what does that mean?
[02:36] <lesshaste> and how do I stop it?
[02:36] <ThePub> me3: apt-cache search irc?  then find an ircd that sounds good, then install it?
=== atlas_ is now known as Atlas95
[02:36] <Lardarse> lemonsCC: 28:12 :-)
[02:36] <me3> legend
[02:36] <ThePub> me3: do some research on the web about irc servers and find one that sounds interesting.. search apt for it?
[02:37] <gpfreitas> Is there another irc channel where I could ask questions about usplash?
[02:37] <me3> yeah i saw one that said the latest version of ubuntu had it with it on the cd
[02:37] <sc4ttrbrain> gpfreitas: u want to change usplash?
[02:37] <Hannibal> argh.
[02:37] <me3> im damed if i can figure out what one
[02:37] <me3> or for that reasn why would they
[02:38] <Hannibal> iwlist ath0 scan just waits a long time and then goes "Failed to read scan data : Resource temporarily unavailable"
[02:38] <me3> exit
[02:38] <gpfreitas> Yes, I want to change usplash.
[02:38] <Hannibal> and dhclient doesn't seem to get an IP from this machine, probably because 'something' in the WiFi config is screwed up.
[02:39] <gpfreitas> But I just don't know how.
[02:39] <gpfreitas> I just want my ubuntu usplash back.
[02:39] <jrib> gpfreitas: sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so   iirc.  You will need to 'sudo update-initramfs -u' (also from memory)
[02:39] <gpfreitas> I have kubuntu's now.
[02:39] <Hannibal> gpfreitas: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Change_Usplash
[02:39] <gpfreitas> Thanks everyone! I'll try that.
[02:39] <Hannibal> (yay for google)
[02:40] <lemonsCC> me3: what?
[02:40] <lemonsCC> lardarse: yes?
[02:40] <Hannibal> lemonsCC: me3 left. :)
[02:40] <lemonsCC> ok
[02:40] <Lardarse> 28:12 = fast :-)
[02:40] <lemonsCC> i dont know who he was or what he was asking...
[02:40] <w3ccv> Hannibal, what does /var/log/messages say
[02:40] <lemonsCC> its done?
[02:40] <Lardarse> yeah
[02:40] <lemonsCC> great now burn at a low speed
[02:41] <lemonsCC> or you will make frisbees
[02:41] <Lardarse> i usualy burn at 8x
[02:41] <LiraNuna> !grub
[02:41] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:41] <Lardarse> heh
[02:41] <Hannibal> w3ccv: nothing for the last 10 minutes, according to tail
[02:41] <lemonsCC> !iso
[02:41] <ubotu> To mount an ISO disc image, type "sudo mount -o loop my.iso <mountpoint>" - bin/cue can be converted to ISO using !bchunk - ISO images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before burning
[02:41] <Hannibal> the last 5 messages were kernel initialization things from when I rebooted, and complaints from gconfd
[02:41] <w3ccv> Hannibal, does that cover your wifi error
[02:41] <prestosd> lemonsCC, go back to #mount
[02:43] <w3ccv> Hannibal, little documented - WEP needs to be the format (all hex of course)  nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nn ...but doesn't sound like yoiu are there yet
[02:43] <me3> thanks ThePub
[02:44] <lemonsCC> me3 did you get your answer?
[02:44] <Hannibal> w3ccv: I'm using an open network atm.
[02:44] <Hannibal> w3ccv: it's disabled unless I really need it - like now.
[02:44] <lemonsCC> i never verify .iso
[02:44] <Hannibal> so I'm not too worried about encryption
[02:44] <Hannibal> and I can't find much in /var/log/messages
[02:44] <Hannibal> except...
[02:45] <Hannibal> at every boot, loading hardware drivers notes a [FAIL] 
[02:45] <Hannibal> because some of the cardbus IRQ's are not present / misaligned / whatever
[02:45] <Hannibal> it says to upgrade my BIOS
[02:45] <Hannibal> however, it says that all the time
[02:45] <Hannibal> and before I rebooted, internet worked fine
[02:45] <w3ccv> Hannibal, that doesn't sound good, but I can't help with that  SRI
[02:45] <Hannibal> at least, most things other than the ubuntu servers :(
[02:46] <Hannibal> well, right, but I can't see how it's related if it worked before with the same errors present.
[02:46] <Hannibal> also, iwconfig and ifconfig seem perfectly happy with the card
[02:47] <Hannibal> they see it and everything.
[02:47] <Hannibal> so I'm confused about what's wrong :)
[02:47] <Thialfihar> 'allo, 'allo
[02:47] <soundray> Hannibal: is there anything that actually doesn't work because of this?
[02:47] <sedrake> den sger fortfarande "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[02:47] <sedrake> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[02:47] <sedrake> " =/
[02:48] <lemonsCC> it link -s [file]  [file]  the command for symlinks?
[02:48] <Hannibal> soundray: well, like I said, I can't get dhclient to obtain an IP from this machine (which is routing)
[02:48] <lemonsCC> is*
[02:48] <Hannibal> over said wireless card
[02:48] <soundray> lemonsCC: no, ln
[02:48] <lemonsCC> ah ha
[02:48] <Hannibal> which is stuck in said cardbus slot
[02:48] <Hannibal> soundray: so, no IP and no dns == no internet.
[02:48] <Constantino> hi
[02:48] <soundray> Hannibal: sorry, I'm late to the game, so I didn't read that
[02:48] <Hannibal> soundray: and I broke my ethernet port on the machine, so wireless is my only option :(
[02:49] <Hannibal> soundray: that's ok, any help is appreciated.
[02:49] <Hannibal> (I actually broke the physical ethernet port, so that's beyond repair)
[02:49] <lemonsCC> soundray link is the mac command i think
[02:49] <willskills> lol, Hannibal how did you do that???
[02:49] <Thialfihar> Is there a nice little benchmark tool to test CPU performance?
[02:49] <willskills> break the ethernet port I mean.... ;)
[02:49] <soundray> Hannibal: if the wireless driver actually loads, and dhclient offers to run on the interface, then interrupts aren't a problem
[02:49] <w3ccv> Hannibal, have you tried putting an IP an dns in manuyally?
[02:50] <Hannibal> willskills: merm. I had a mess of cables, two ethernet ones and 1 phone one
[02:50] <soundray> Hannibal: at least I wouldn't attack it that way.
[02:50] <willskills> Thialfihar, if ytou have Dapper installed, just use System Monitor from; System > Admin > system Monitor
[02:50] <Hannibal> willskills: picked the wrong one, not looking carefully. It tucked some coppery thing out of the ethernet port when I took it out.
[02:50] <Hannibal> so, that's how
[02:50] <Hannibal> soundray: sounds reasonable.
[02:50] <willskills> lol :)
[02:50] <w3ccv> Hannibal, if your ap is set up normally it is the default router (gateway) and also the dns server
[02:50] <Hannibal> w3ccv: no, but I can do.
[02:51] <willskills> go buy a new NIC? they cost like nothing :D
[02:51] <Hannibal> willskills: for a laptop?
[02:51] <Hannibal> willskills: right...
[02:51] <lemonsCC> yep
[02:51] <willskills> ah... ;<
[02:51] <soundray> Thialfihar: bogomips from the sysutils package
[02:51] <lemonsCC> pcimia network card??
[02:51] <Thialfihar> Yar, willskills, the CPU usage is not a problem. Wanna know the actual speed of the CPU.
[02:52] <floating_> ThePub: The w3m www browser. I have a work around to see images, but I don't have a keymap file in w3m dir, and doubt I can just make it. view image and few other options in rightclick menu doesnt work now but,..
[02:52] <soundray> Thialfihar: not *really* useful for comparing different CPUs, but usable to see the effects of, e.g., overclocking
[02:52] <Thialfihar> Ok, installing that right now.
[02:52] <Hannibal> lemonsCC: right, but those are pretty rare down here. (Holland)
[02:52] <willskills> ah right, ok :)
[02:52] <Hannibal> at least, to my knowledge
[02:52] <lemonsCC> oops
[02:53] <lemonsCC> ebay!
[02:53] <willskills> Hannibal, they shouldnt be rare
[02:53] <Hannibal> for the past, uh, 10 years or so, they're pretty good about stuffing network thingies in laptops
[02:53] <Thialfihar> Dapper is which Ubuntu version?
[02:53] <Hannibal> so why would anyone need them?
[02:53] <willskills> ANY store selling PC hardware should have one
[02:53] <Hannibal> willskills: pcmcia ones?
[02:53] <Hannibal> they have pci ones, sure
[02:53] <willskills> Dapper - 6.06
[02:53] <Hannibal> but not pcmcia ones.
[02:53] <willskills> go in there and give them a bitchslap in the face and to order some!
[02:54] <Thialfihar> aha, aye
[02:54] <Thialfihar> Got Edgy here.
[02:54] <soundray> Hannibal: a good way is to get a PCMCIA USB 2.0 card... I find that much more flexible.
[02:54] <soundray> Hannibal: but let's do some software checks before anything else... what driver supports your wireless card?
[02:55] <Hannibal> soundray: ath - it's an atheros g chipset.
[02:55] <Hannibal> er
[02:55] <Hannibal> s/ath/madwifi/
[02:55] <soundray> Hannibal: have you tried updating to the latest madwifi stuff?#
[02:55] <Hannibal> soundray: I can't if I don't have internet, and it worked fine up to the last reboot
[02:56] <Hannibal> or maybe up to the point where I upgraded to edgy and that failed halfway through
[02:56] <Hannibal> maybe it helps if I shut it down normally, and then start over.
[02:56] <soundray> Hannibal: dang! Have you got a backup of your dapper install?
[02:56] <Hannibal> soundray: no.
[02:56] <Hannibal> soundray: the funny thing is, it still boots.
[02:57] <soundray> Hannibal: have you got a live CD?
[02:57] <Hannibal> even though it claims xubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop are broken
[02:57] <Hannibal> only a breezy one, I think.
[02:57] <Hannibal> which is just going to be older, of course.
[02:57] <w3ccv> Hannibal, missed your ealier comment - `ipconfig wan0 192.168.1.200`  then try to ping 192.168.1.1 (match the numbers to your network)
[02:57] <Hannibal> w3ccv: ah, thanks :)
[02:58] <Thialfihar> soundray: installed sysutils, but I can't find bogomips.
[02:58] <Thialfihar> procinfo and such works... hmm
[02:58] <soundray> Hannibal: replace wan0 with ath0 there, w3ccv?
[02:58] <Hannibal> yeah, but I could guess that much :)
[02:58] <w3ccv> Hannibal, if ath0 is your wireless port,
[02:59] <Hannibal> it is :)
[02:59] <soundray> Thialfihar: sorry, I missed the latest developments. Read the description in 'apt-cache show sysutils'
[03:00] <ThePub> floating_: ah, ok.. sorry, idk anything about that, thought you were trying to view a "w3m file" (maybe I read you wrong) with xv.  :)
[03:00] <Thialfihar> Says bogomips was dropped.
[03:00] <Thialfihar> No other way to get it?
[03:00] <Hannibal> ok, this is stupid
[03:00] <Hannibal> the shutdown + cold reboot fixed it.
[03:01] <SheriF_SpacE> i'm trying to compile v4l2 on dapper 2.6.15-27-686 and i do always get this error linux/modversions.h: No such file or directory and media/v4l2-dev.h: No such file or directory
[03:02] <SheriF_SpacE> v4l2 should be a kernel module
[03:02] <genie> Hi all
[03:02] <soundray> SheriF_SpacE: install the linux-headers package that corresponds to your current kernel
[03:02] <Hannibal> ok, so back to the original problem.
[03:03] <Hannibal> connecting to www.google.com works
[03:03] <SheriF_SpacE> soundray: already installed
[03:03] <w3ccv> Hannibal, there are some registers in hardware that are not reset with a warm boot. or even a hardware reset on desktops
[03:03] <genie> What would be the best program to use to backup my ubuntu server onto AIT2 tape and how would I restore it after ?
[03:03] <Hannibal> connecting to www.ubuntu.com and http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ on this machine (the router) works
[03:03] <Hannibal> opening either of those ubuntu addresses in the browser on the laptop fails
[03:03] <Hannibal> telnetting to them works.
[03:03] <Hannibal> (on port 80, anyway)
[03:04] <Thialfihar> bbiab
[03:04] <Hannibal> (browser 'fails', meaning, it gets stuck on "Waiting for <stuff>.ubuntu.com..."
[03:04] <Hannibal> apt-get gets stuck for a long time on [Waiting for headers]  and then eventually gives up.
[03:04] <kling0n> Hannibal:  try doing an nslookup for the address on the machine
[03:04] <Hannibal> kling0n: already done, it works fine.
[03:05] <kling0n> which browser?
[03:05] <soundray> Hannibal: what if you enter the ip address in the browser?
[03:05] <Hannibal> kling0n: reports the ip correctly, verified it with this machine, it's correct.
[03:05] <Hannibal> kling0n: firefox, but links gives the same response
[03:05] <w3ccv> Hannibal, "netstat -rn" should show the routing - it should point to the AP
[03:05] <kling0n> Hanna:  about:config, then set network.http.use-cache to false
[03:06] <Hannibal> soundray: it doesn't connect if I just hand it the ip
[03:06] <kling0n> oh.. links has same error?
[03:06] <kling0n> did you set up a firewall?P
[03:06] <kling0n> hmm no.. not if telnet works
[03:06] <soundray> SheriF_SpacE: sorry, I've no other suggestions
[03:06] <gavin__> I installed gnome through aptitude (I'm not using ubuntu-desktop) and when I updated it (after installing) it started to delete some base gnome packages. Now I have broken dependancies but synaptic doesn't find then. Can anyone help?
[03:06] <kling0n> tcpdump -i eth0 -X
[03:06] <kling0n> then try again
[03:07] <kling0n> with tcpdump running in xterm or similar
[03:07] <Hannibal> w3ccv: works
[03:07] <Hannibal> or at least,t he netstat points to the ap
[03:08] <MartinKryl> Hey could I ask what to do? My upating broke and now even sudo dpkg --configure -a does not work (it only returns error message)
[03:08] <w3ccv> Hannibal, does "nslookup" show a good nameserver?  probably your ap
[03:08] <kling0n> MartinKryl:  try apt-get --fix-missing install
[03:08] <Hannibal> w3ccv: yes, it does
[03:09] <grazie> I'm getting quite frequent (3/4 week) system crashes and the desktop machine isn't on pernamently. strongly suspect hardware and I can't see anything the logs.
[03:09] <w3ccv> Hannibal, ok routing is good, ns is good.
[03:09] <grazie> Any suggestions for tracking down the problem or a good IRC channel?
[03:10] <soundray> Hannibal: this may sound stupid, but maybe firefox isn't acting on your current resolv.conf. Restart it to make sure.
[03:10] <MartinKryl> Nothing. It just tells me to run dpkg --configure -a
[03:10] <lemonsCC> grazie what is happening when it crashes?
[03:10] <Hannibal> soundray: ok, no changes.
[03:10] <Hannibal> kling0n: uploading the tcpdump, hang on
[03:10] <grazie> MartinKryl: System reset
[03:10] <nomin-> I recently installed mythtv on dapper but I'm only getting sound in the left earphone when it records from the line-in.  What can I do to make sure line-in records one channel as two channels?
[03:11] <Hannibal> ok, http://www.gijsk.com/temp/tcpdump.txt
[03:11] <MartinKryl> and that tells me that something is wrong with /var/lib/dpkg/updates/0024
[03:11] <Slart> Is anyone here familiar with aoss and the .asoundrc settings? I'm trying to do software (or hardware if that's possible) mixing for applications using oss for sound output
[03:11] <lemonsCC> nomin are headphones plugged in all the way?
[03:11] <MartinKryl> grazie: Even that does not help triedmany times
[03:12] <Hannibal> kling0n: I have no idea how to interpret that though.
[03:12] <Hannibal> w3ccv: yeah. I can't figure it out. :(
[03:12] <genie> is com 1 ttdy01 or 00 ?
[03:12] <nomin-> lemonsCC, yes.  I get sound from the cable card just fine with tvtime.  This link shows people with the exact same problem I'm having:  AC97 in only one speaker  http://threebit.net/mail-archive/mythtv-users/msg00722.html
[03:12] <kling0n> Hannibal:  what ip is returned from nslookup?
[03:13] <soundray> genie: com1 is /dev/ttyS0
[03:13] <nomin-> Strange Audio Behavior - Static in One Speaker  http://threebit.net/mail-archive/mythtv-users/msg00005.html  <---another one with the same problem I'm having.  How do I solve this?
[03:13] <Hannibal> kling0n: 213.136.29.196
[03:13] <kling0n> Hannibal:  it looks like firefox resolves the address to 192.168.0.34
[03:13] <soundray> grazie: do you monitor your system temperature?
[03:13] <genie> thanks soundray u can tell im new to linux lol :)
[03:13] <ProN00b> does anyone know how i can play video files with the audiocodec which has the fourcc 'samr' ? (from a mobile phone, as mp4)
[03:13] <Hannibal> kling0n: for nl.archive.ubuntu.com
[03:13] <Hannibal> kling0n: that's apt-get, not firefox
[03:13] <arwalke> can anyone help me with bluetooth?
[03:13] <kling0n> yah
[03:13] <soundray> genie: and you have an old computer with a serial port ;)
[03:14] <soundray> !bluetooth | arwalke
[03:14] <ubotu> arwalke: For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[03:14] <w3ccv> Hannibal, do you have a Proxy set in Firefox
[03:14] <genie> bless its for the APC link :)
[03:14] <Hannibal> w3ccv: no.
[03:14] <Hannibal> w3ccv: I've tried setting up an ssh tunnel but failed, though that just may have been me being dumb about how to do that.
[03:14] <grazie> lemonsCC: Not much chance of solving then? (s/MartinKryl/lemonsCC in previous)
[03:15] <grazie> soundray: No I don't - worth trying?
[03:15] <Hannibal> ssh -NT -D #### user@host.com
[03:15] <Hannibal> sound wrong to you? :)
[03:15] <kling0n> Hannibal: can I see output of netstat -arn ?
[03:15] <soundray> grazie: I think so. mbmon is nice&simple if it works with your board
[03:15] <Hannibal> kling0n: it points to my ap, ie, 192.168.0.1
[03:15] <|\Sushi> hi all
[03:16] <Hannibal> genmask is 255.255.255.0
[03:16] <soundray> grazie: and it logs to /var/log if you tell it to
[03:16] <Hannibal> doesnt' look like there's anything out of the ordinary there.
[03:16] <kling0n> traceroute nl.ubuntu.com ?
[03:16] <MartinKryl> should I maybe delete that file?
[03:16] <Hannibal> kling0n: ping and telnet worked, so not sure how that'd help, but ok.
[03:16] <hikenboot> hello all back again hoping someone in here knows bind9 and dynamic dns...webmin tells me the dynamic master zone (updates not allowed) http://pastebin.ca/270092
[03:16] <|\Sushi> a simple question :) how can I config connection to internet through a proxy ? (non in FF)
[03:16] <DARKGuy> Mornin' :)
[03:17] <lemonsCC> grazie: could it be a heat issue?  mb detects the temps to high and shutsdown?
[03:17] <yolas22[cours] > hi
[03:17] <Hannibal> kling0n: seems to get to jun1.galilei.network.bit.nl and then stop getting pingbacks
[03:17] <soundray> MartinKryl: I have a bit of experience with your type of problem. How painful would it be for you to boot from edgy live, backup your data and do a fresh install? IME this can be done in under an hour, saving you net time in many instances.
[03:17] <Hannibal> (that's 213.136.31.4)
[03:18] <kling0n> hmm.. telnet works but all browsers fail
[03:18] <soundray> Hannibal: looks like an ISP problem then...
[03:18] <kling0n> Hannibal:  do you have a HTTP_PROXY in your environment settings?
[03:18] <Hannibal> soundray: then how come this machine works?
[03:18] <MartinKryl> soundray: :( wow taht sounds scary :) Must be possible somehow ... I will give it a try
[03:18] <grazie> I thought temp problems were mostly with laptops, but I'll give it a go. Thanks all.
[03:18] <Hannibal> (note: setup is ISP -> router -> this machine -> laptop)
[03:19] <MartinKryl> soundray: But thanks .)
[03:19] <uksprout> newbie (or dumb As) question I am trying to install and configure a game.... I need to download some files into the /usr/local/games/ path system reports cannot change contents... change folder properties A should I change the perms B what would I set them too
[03:19] <|\Sushi> how can I config connection to internet through a proxy in ubuntu? (non in FF)
[03:19] <soundray> Hannibal: in that case I would suspect the sharing setup on "this machine"
[03:19] <kling0n> uksprout : if anything simply change ownership of the files
[03:19] <yolas22[cours] > is It normal firefox crashes when I launch a java applet
[03:19] <Hannibal> soundray: ok, I'm afraid this machine is running windows. I don't suppose you know what to look for? :)
[03:20] <kling0n> Hannibal:  ipconfig /all
[03:20] <Hannibal> kling0n: env | grep HTTP
[03:20] <Hannibal> turns up empty
[03:20] <kling0n> k
[03:20] <ThePub> so what's the relation to khtml and webkit these days?
[03:21] <soundray> Hannibal: grep -i HTTP
[03:21] <uksprout> klingon: all I get is permission denied
[03:21] <Hannibal> soundray: still empty.
[03:21] <lech> hello, does anyone here have any insight to preserving a windows ntfs partitions while installing ubuntu? will it happily install while maintaining that partition for me?
[03:21] <soundray> Hannibal: can you not connect the laptop direct to the router for a trial?
[03:21] <Hannibal> kling0n: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35921/
[03:22] <soundray> lech: yes
[03:22] <soundray> !dualboot | lech
[03:22] <ubotu> lech: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[03:22] <Hannibal> soundray: no, because the router uses WPA-PSK encryption for its wireless, and I don't know how to set that up on the laptop. As mentioned, ethernet is butched, so :(
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[03:22] <uksprout> klingon: sorted thanks forgot to sudo
[03:22] <lech> soundray: I'm completely switching over to ubuntu as soon as eft finishes and I manage to actually get back into windows to burn the iso, but I have a partition on this disk with files and such I want to preserve
[03:23] <lech> -windows ++ubuntu
[03:23] <kling0n> Hannibal:  that it a different subnet?! 192.168.2.1
[03:23] <kling0n> is 192.168.2.1 configured correctly?
[03:23] <Hannibal> kling0n: like I said, the structure is router -> this windows box -> laptop
[03:23] <kling0n> and its the windows box that isnt working? or the laptop?
[03:23] <Hannibal> kling0n: that's a samsung adsl/voip set. I can only do limited config on it because technically my ISP owns it.
[03:23] <Hannibal> the laptop doesn't work
[03:24] <Hannibal> this machine works fine.
[03:24] <kling0n> ok
[03:24] <lech> soundray: so ubuntu should happily get along with that partition still, right?
[03:24] <soundray> lech: it's recommended to back up all data on any harddisk that you're going to install to, but normally, it would leave such a partition untouched if there is enough space on the remainder on the disk.
[03:24] <kling0n> have you enabled ip forwarding?
[03:25] <Hannibal> kling0n: I've told my ASUS wireless app to do ICS for me. It works fine, apart from the ubuntu servers.
[03:25] <Hannibal> kling0n: so I don't know
[03:25] <lech> soundray: would I still have access to it under ubuntu or would i need to transform it to a compatible format?
[03:25] <Hannibal> I think the ipconfig says I have, though
[03:25] <soundray> lech: of course, even if there wasn't enough space, it would ask you before resizing it
[03:25] <Hannibal> 08.         IP-routering ingeschakeld. . . . .: ja
[03:25] <Hannibal> would translate to: IP-routering enabled: . . . . : yes
[03:25] <soundray> lech: ubuntu gives you read-only access to NTFS
[03:25] <soundray> lech: with a bit of trickery (fuse), you can mount it read-write as well
[03:25] <kling0n> hannibal if the laptop is using the windows machine as gateway, windows needs to be configured to  do ip forwarding
[03:25] <soundray> !fuse | lech
[03:25] <ubotu> lech: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[03:26] <Hannibal> kling0n: right, but like I said, I think ipconfig says it's enabled.
[03:26] <lech> soundray: ok so I could then later just copy over "space allowing" to my home directory, repartition it and throw it back, right?
[03:26] <kling0n> you can check in network settings -> properties
[03:26] <kling0n> there should be a tab called "internet connection charing"
[03:26] <kling0n> sharing even
[03:26] <soundray> lech: yes
[03:26] <lech> excellent, thanks
[03:27] <lemonsCC> lech: i reccomend a Fat32 partition if you want to manipulate files from windows
[03:27] <kling0n> where you choose local interfaces that are allowed to use the network connection as  gateway
[03:27] <soundray> lech: I would still suggest you borrow an external HD or something like that to really have your data safe.
[03:27] <lech> soundray: yes, i've done the multiple backups already :)
[03:27] <kling0n> lech there is a ext2fs driver for windows
[03:27] <Hannibal> kling0n: there's no such tab. But I've configured all that in the wireless app, and as far as I can tell everything *else* seems to work.
[03:27] <kling0n> ok
[03:27] <Z3dzDead> Hi, do I need to install any xinerama related stuff to switch between two monitors? not a second monitor- i've got it connected to my TV actually.
[03:28] <lemonsCC> kling0n isnt ubuntu's default ext3?
[03:28] <Z3dzDead> problem is, i can't switch between the two without restarting
[03:28] <kling0n> Hannibal:  so you can get to  the dsl router from the laptop
[03:28] <soundray> lech: it's good to deal with someone sensible ;)
[03:28] <Hannibal> ie, www.google.com and www.digg.com and Bob knows what else works.
[03:28] <Hannibal> kling0n: good question, I'll check
[03:28] <kling0n> lemonsCC:  ext3fs is ext2fs with journaling
[03:28] <kling0n> you can mount is as ext2fs
[03:28] <Hannibal> kling0n: yes.
[03:28] <lemonsCC> kling0n:  very good!
[03:28] <lech> soundray: with 50gb of personal files, it's always safe to have backups, as soon as windows allows me back in i'm burning some dvd backups as well
[03:28] <DARKGuy> Z3dzDead: What do you mean with switching between the two monitors? oO
[03:28] <refnumzx> when i replace my NIC dmesg says it is eth0 but when i do ifupeth0 which is also defined in /etc/network/interfaces it says device not found
[03:28] <Gosteh> I have a question: Can I unmount a partition and restart my computer so that it stays unmounted throughout?
[03:29] <kling0n> lemonsCC:  you dont get the journaling features though
[03:29] <lemonsCC> kilng0n of course
[03:29] <kling0n> Gosteh:  simply comment out the entry in /etc/fstab
[03:29] <lemonsCC> Gosteh: what is the partition?
[03:29] <Z3dzDead> DARKGuy: Say, i want to switch to a new X session- and I don't mind killing the current session and restarting on the TV.
[03:29] <kling0n> gosteh sudo umount /mnt/mountpoint
[03:29] <Z3dzDead> i figure i have to add the screen bit to xorg.conf
[03:29] <w3ccv> Gosteh, edit /etc/fstab,  comment out the mount you dont' want
[03:29] <my_haz> Gosteh: do you know about /etc/fstab
[03:29] <lemonsCC> !fstab
[03:29] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file lists all drives and partitions that are mounted on the system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions
[03:30] <Gosteh> thanks
[03:30] <soundray> kling0n: that's not permanent though
[03:30] <lech> I'll probably be sticking around as I install, since I guess I'm still a *nix "n00b" and will need some help
[03:30] <Z3dzDead> Tried that some time ago and didnt work- so i was wondering if I'd need any additional packages.
[03:30] <tonyyarusso> Gosteh: All you need is noauto in fstab; no need to comment it out
[03:30] <genie> Im looking for some software like !ACT from sage but a Linux open source one any one recommend anything ?
[03:30] <lemonsCC> Gosteh just got bombarded with fstab info!!!!
[03:30] <kling0n> soundray:  I know... i simply want him to unmount it before he comments it out
[03:30] <DARKGuy> Z3dzDead: I'm not really getting it, you mean having a dual monitor setup with ability to move apps between the two monitors?
[03:30] <Gosteh> a little confused now :P
[03:30] <lech> soundray: hows the nvidia "dual view" within ubuntu?
[03:30] <kling0n> !xinerama | Z3dzDead
[03:30] <ubotu> Z3dzDead: xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[03:31] <lemonsCC> gosteh:  read this page http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html
[03:31] <Z3dzDead> DARKGuy: no. not at all. that sounds way above my head. Just won't two screens to work at the same time- even if its in a new X session.
[03:31] <soundray> ubotu, no, fstab is The /etc/fstab file lists all partitions that should be mounted at boot. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions
[03:31] <lemonsCC> and figure out which partition you want to unmount
[03:31] <DARKGuy> Z3dzDead: you need to add the screen, monitor and device sections for your new monitor in the xorg.conf file
[03:31] <kling0n> Hannibal:  can you do other stuff on the intarnets? like ftp, ssh or similar?
[03:31] <DARKGuy> Z3dzDead: you can follow a howto (skip step 3 then) here: http://dragon2008.blogspot.com
[03:32] <lemonsCC> soundray are you correcting ubotu?
[03:32] <Hannibal> kling0n: yeah, I used scp to upload the tcpdump
[03:32] <soundray> !fstab
[03:32] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file lists all partitions that should be mounted at boot. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[03:32] <soundray> lemonsCC: yes
[03:32] <lemonsCC> lol
[03:32] <Gosteh> thanks lemonsCC
[03:32] <Hannibal> kling0n: and ftp'ing to ftp.mozilla.org/pub/ works fine, too.
[03:32] <compengi> how to capture from line-in?
[03:32] <refnumzx> when i replace my NIC dmesg says it is eth0 but when i do ifupeth0 which is also defined in /etc/network/interfaces it says device not found  i also know about modprobe and have tried that and then ifup eth0 and it still says device not found.
[03:33] <soundray> lemonsCC: it worked to... They used to have a review procedure, that's cut out again now apparently
[03:33] <LjL> soundray: use <reply> for that kind of factoids
[03:33] <kling0n> hannibal: sudo /etc/inet.d/networking restart
[03:33] <derv> hi all. can u help me? I need sshd, but I can find it in my system (5.04)
[03:33] <MeggaMortY> i am having trouble installing ubuntu from the liveCD... i get a black screen after ubuntu loads, can anyone help?
[03:33] <kling0n> Hannibal:  just in case
[03:33] <lemonsCC> gosteh do you have any clue as to what you DONT want mounted now?

[03:34] <Omarpb> I copy a file from linux to /dev/hda1 (windows partition) and I overwrited the firsts 512 of the boot partition, I did not how fix it, I can not join to windows, someone can help me?
[03:34] <Hannibal> kling0n: it doesn't manage to get an ip now (dhclient(3?) doesn't, anyway)
[03:34] <LjL> soundray: yes, well no, not in general - i mean, the way you did it, it would result in "fstab is The /etc/fstab file is ...", while with "!fstab is <reply> blablah" it then just says "The /etc/fstab file is..."
[03:34] <derv> jrib: thanks!
[03:35] <Gosteh> yes, my smallest partition has some weird stuff that came with this laptop, I want to test it out without this partition to see if it's safe to format
[03:35] <Hannibal> kling0n: oh, correction, it does.
[03:35] <MeggaMortY> i am having trouble installing ubuntu from the liveCD... i get a black screen after ubuntu loads, can anyone help?
[03:35] <soundray> LjL: ah, found it in the wiki, too. Thanks!
[03:35] <Hannibal> kling0n: just took exceptionally long, considering the machines are next to eachother :)
[03:35] <Omarpb> I copy a file from linux to /dev/hda1 (windows partition) and I overwrited the firsts 512 of the boot partition, I did not how fix it, I can not join to windows, someone can help me?
[03:35] <kling0n> Hannibal:  let's see.. the reaseon you're not connecting the laptop directly to the router is that it uses wpa?
[03:35] <lemonsCC> gosteh just add that # in front of that partition and reboot
[03:35] <Hannibal> kling0n: yeah, mostly
[03:35] <Gosteh> thanks
[03:35] <Hannibal> kling0n: I have wlanconfig or whatever it's called again though
[03:35] <Gosteh> shall try that now
[03:36] <lemonsCC> k
[03:36] <kling0n> hannibal lets try a different approach... comment out the wireless(?) interface in /etc/network/interfaces and let gnome-network-tool do the setup and auth for you
[03:36] <Dimensions> kling0n:  u mean Gparted ??? i have that installed but u can't do it when u are running ubuntu and with live cd my laptop stucks when i use gnome partitioner ...
[03:36] <kling0n> Hannibal:  you need to restart /etc/init.d/dbus though

[03:37] <Omarpb> I copy a file from linux to /dev/hda1 (windows partition) and I overwrited the firsts 512 of the boot partition, I did not how fix it, I can not join to windows, someone can help me?
[03:37] <biotrox> i'm a newbie and just install ubuntu from a live CD
[03:37] <biotrox> 6.10
[03:37] <tonyyarusso> KenSentMe: On Edgy, the default will be fine.  Earlier versions need others.
[03:37] <refnumzx> when i replace my NIC dmesg says it is eth0 but when i do ifupeth0 which is also defined in /etc/network/interfaces it says device not found  i also know about modprobe and have tried that and then ifup eth0 and it still says device not found.
[03:37] <FirstStrike> !ask | biotrox
[03:37] <ubotu> biotrox: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:37] <kling0n> refnumzx:  sudo ifconfig eth0 up
[03:37] <KenSentMe> tonyyarusso: but i mean, generic, 386 or 686?
[03:38] <MeggaMortY> i am having trouble installing ubuntu from the liveCD... i get a black screen after ubuntu loads, can anyone help?
[03:38] <refnumzx> i have tried that
[03:38] <tonyyarusso> KenSentMe: It's "generic"
[03:38] <prh> refnumzx: look at /etc/udevd/rules.d/Z25*net* - it keeps a memory of which MAC eth0 should have so a new card would get eth1
[03:38] <LjL> soundray: i borrowed something else from Wikipedia for that factoid anyway, since we were saying that it's not really true that it strictly lists partitions that are mounted at boot (see noauto), and also has the purposes of mounting partitions "easily"
[03:38] <soundray> KenSentMe: 2.6.17-10-generic
[03:38] <Hannibal> kling0n: ok, hang on while I get out of xfce and back into gnome

[03:38] <kling0n> Hannibal:  you can just startit within xf e though
[03:38] <Dimensions> kling0n: how do you use it from command line u mean when i boot into my ubuntu without using installer cd ???
[03:38] <kling0n> xfce even
[03:38] <KenSentMe> tonyyarusso, soundray: okay, thank you
[03:38] <refnumzx> how do i change it back to eth0?
[03:38] <kling0n> Dimensions:  start a terminal
[03:38] <biotrox> how do i change the medium source..?
[03:38] <syntaxx> i want to use kubuntu but i only have ubuntu cd how to migrate ubuntu to kubuntu? and does it remove all unnecessary files when changing to kubuntu?
[03:38] <kling0n> Dimensions:  or ctrl+alt+f1
[03:38] <soundray> LjL: makes good sense to me
[03:39] <unimatrix9> hi there
[03:39] <kling0n> syntaxx:  sudo apt-get install kde-desktop
[03:39] <prh> refnumzx: you can probably just delete that file - thre is a z45... which creates it I think
[03:39] <MeggaMortY> can anybody help with installing ubuntu? im a noob
[03:39] <unimatrix9> i got my monitor at the wrong hz, how to change it?
[03:39] <syntaxx> kling0n: ok does it remove also unnecessary files?
[03:39] <kling0n> unimatrix9:  edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:39] <kling0n> syntaxx:  no
[03:39] <unimatrix9> its kicking in 75 hz, and needs to be 60 hz
[03:39] <Hannibal> kling0n: gnome-network-tool is not found
[03:39] <kling0n> unimatrix9:  look for the refresh sections

[03:39] <Hannibal> you mean gnome-network-preferences ?
[03:39] <kling0n> Hannibal:  no
[03:40] <syntaxx> kling0n: ok thanks
[03:40] <refnumzx> hmm, thanks
[03:40] <kling0n> Hannibal:  youll need to install it then
[03:40] <Dimensions> kling0n:  i cd'ed into /usr/bin and tried to run gparted with sudo and then gave error only root can do it so did sudo -i to be root and it gives error now ...that terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Glib::OptionError Aborted
[03:40] <Hannibal> kling0n: can't, no connectivity to the damn servers remember :(
[03:40] <unimatrix9> klingOn, have got an min, becuase there is no hz in my xorg.conf
[03:40] <soundray> kling0n: don't you mean network-manager-gnome ?
[03:41] <MeggaMortY> i am having trouble installing ubuntu from the liveCD... i get a black screen after ubuntu loads, can anyone help?
[03:41] <kling0n> Hannibal:  or use the wpa_password tool and put it into the wpa_config
[03:41] <unimatrix9> Identifier     "SyncMaster"
[03:41] <unimatrix9>     Option         "DPMS"

[03:41] <kling0n> soundray, hannibal: that's the bugger
[03:41] <Hannibal> soundray: it doesn't have that either.
[03:41] <unimatrix9> thats how it looks...

[03:41] <Hannibal> oh, bah, forgot to sudo
[03:41] <syntaxx> kling0n: should i remove ubuntu-desktop if i dont want that to be my default?
[03:41] <Omarpb> no body knows how to fix it?????????????????????????'
[03:41] <kling0n> syntaxx:  I don't think so
[03:41] <Hannibal> still nothing though :(
[03:41] <MeggaMortY> i am having trouble installing ubuntu from the liveCD... i get a black screen after ubuntu loads, can anyone help?
[03:42] <Omarpb> no body knows how to fix it?????????????????????????'
[03:42] <lemonsCC> syntaxx that wont remove the installed packages
[03:42] <Hannibal> ok, the wpa thing...
[03:42] <kling0n> syntaxx:  unless you're in need for space, simply change your default session
[03:42] <soundray> Omarpb: don't repeat
[03:42] <soundray> Omarpb: if someone knew, they would tell you
[03:42] <syntaxx> kling0n: hmm ok.. but all the splash screen will switch to kubuntu?
[03:42] <kling0n> syntaxx heh no
[03:42] <biotrox> all... still waiting.. my answer..
[03:42] <Hannibal> hum let's see.
[03:42] <biotrox> changing source of medium
[03:42] <kling0n> syntaxx you can change your /etc/apt/sources.list to use kubuntu repositories
[03:43] <lemonsCC> omarpb:  put in your windows disk go to recovery console and type fix mbr
[03:43] <biotrox> how do i do that
[03:43] <kling0n> syntaxx then apt-get --reinstall -usplash
[03:43] <kling0n> syntaxx then apt-get --reinstall usplash
[03:43] <Dimensions> how do you access parted in GUI ?
[03:43] <lemonsCC> or fixmbr i am not sure
[03:43] <syntaxx> kling0n: hmm ok thanks
[03:43] <soundray> Hannibal: you might try and download the packages to your Windows machine, then copy them to the laptop and install with dpkg -i
[03:43] <Omarpb> sorry soundray, it is only to be sure that everbody read it jaja
[03:43] <MeggaMortY> can anyone help me with a small problem upon installing ubuntu please!?
[03:43] <syntaxx> kling0n: but for now i only need to apt-get install kubuntu-desktop? then change the apt sources list right?
[03:43] <LjL> !anyone
[03:43] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:43] <starscalling> right
[03:43] <Omarpb> lemonsCC, thats work even for laptops?
[03:43] <starscalling> so can one do nvidia properly now?
[03:44] <starscalling> the nv driver is sucking hard
[03:44] <starscalling> !nvidia
[03:44] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:44] <Omarpb> the system disc of the laptop does not have that option
[03:44] <Hannibal> soundray: yeah, I'll use that as a last resort
[03:44] <kling0n> syntaxx that should do the trick :)
[03:44] <soundray> Omarpb: if you're very lucky, you can fix this with a rescue function from a Windows boot disk. This isn't the best forum to ask about that, though
[03:44] <syntaxx> kling0n: ok thanks
[03:44] <Hannibal> kling0n: will that work for a pre-shared WPA-PSK key with no string-like passphrase equivalent?
[03:44] <biotrox> if i don't want to use http source..?
[03:44] <lemonsCC> omarpb if your mbr (master boot record) is messed up it works for any windows computer
[03:45] <Dimensions> guys any one knows how to use parted for patition in GUI ?
[03:45] <soundray> Hannibal: the depends list of that package is miles long unfortunately
[03:45] <lemonsCC> dimensions its gparted
[03:45] <soundray> Hannibal: you may have to use the apt offline tutorial
[03:45] <kling0n> hannibal you mean like a certificate?
[03:45] <Hannibal> soundray: but apt-get can figure out which packages I want though :)
[03:45] <biotrox>  Dimensions gparted
[03:45] <lemonsCC> !gparted | dimensions
[03:45] <ubotu> dimensions: gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[03:45] <kling0n> Hannibal:  or a password?
[03:45] <Hannibal> kling0n: no, just a big hex string
[03:45] <kling0n> Hannibal:  yes
[03:45] <Hannibal> ok :)
[03:45] <KenSentMe> I'm trying to install the nvidia-glx drivers on my laptop with Geforce Go 7300 gpu. I have linux-restricted-modules-generic installed and the nvidia-glx package, but when i run sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[03:45] <kling0n> Hannibal:  it will output a passphrase and the hex equivalent
[03:45] <KenSentMe> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[03:45] <KenSentMe> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[03:46] <kling0n> hannibal do a test to see sample output
[03:46] <dreg> What would cause glxgears to run fine one one monitor but not display on the other (in a setup with two physical nVidia video cards each controlling a single monitor)
[03:46] <Omarpb> thanks lemonsCC, I going to try
[03:46] <soundray> Hannibal: http://www.batmat.net/apt-offline/
[03:46] <Hannibal> kling0n: but the point is, I only have the hex equivalent
[03:46] <KenSentMe> Sorry for the paste, was supposed to be in one line
[03:46] <Dimensions> lemonsCC:  hey hi ... well tried gparted while booting from live cd it stucks my laptop while resizing my sole partition ... what should i do now ?
[03:46] <kling0n> Hannibal:  I understand
[03:46] <kanedaddy> hey
[03:46] <Hannibal> ah. I get it
[03:46] <kling0n> Hannibal:  if you do the wpa_pass though, you can see the syntax
[03:46] <kling0n> :)'
[03:46] <biotrox> what does this line means --> deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 6.10 _Edgy Eft_ - Release i386 (20061025)] / edgy main restricted
[03:46] <kanedaddy> ok
[03:46] <biotrox> edy..?
[03:46] <biotrox> main...?
[03:46] <biotrox> restricted..?
[03:47] <lemonsCC> dimensions how much ram does your laptop have?  and what happened after is got stuck?
[03:47] <soundray> biotrox: it tells apt to use your install CD as a repository.
[03:47] <soundray> biotrox: it's normally best to comment that out and use only online repos
[03:47] <swiftfeet8> I am trying to get the sounds working on my Sony Vaio in Ubuntu Edgy, but am not having any luck.  I have searched the web, but nothing has worked.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please message me if you can help.
[03:47] <biotrox> but i have trouble with quota
[03:48] <dreg> I'm also looking for some help regarding the nVidia driver when someone has a minute
[03:48] <Omarpb> lemonsCC, If I do that, the grub is gonna be ok?
[03:48] <biotrox> my internet connection must be use wisely.. i prefere CD source
[03:48] <KenSentMe> I'm trying to install the nvidia-glx drivers on my laptop with Geforce Go 7300 gpu. I have linux-restricted-modules-generic installed and the nvidia-glx package, but when i run sudo nvidia-glx-config enable i get this error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel. What can i do to solve this?
[03:48] <Hannibal> kling0n: it fails to parse it :s
[03:48] <lemonsCC> omarpb it can be reinstalled
[03:48] <Dimensions> lemonsCC: then opened parted in terminal but thats not GUI One and hard to do partition resizing with that ... --> my lap is Toshiba Satellite Pro so have enuff Ram abt 512 when i resize it ... it just keep doing it without any result for long time ...
[03:48] <soundray> Omarpb: lemonsCC's instructions won't work for you
[03:49] <biotrox> Dimensions | just try cfdisk
[03:49] <soundray> Omarpb: because you didn't overwrite your MBR, you overwrote your hda1 boot sector.
[03:49] <IdleOne> biotrox:  cd cource is fine but you wont get updates/fixes/security updates without online sources
[03:49] <kling0n> hannibal: sorry but I dont have an example handy
[03:49] <AtheIste> #ubuntu-cz
[03:49] <Hannibal> kling0n: it's a 26-char hex string
[03:49] <AtheIste> ops, sorry
[03:49] <floating_> Does anyone know a command to view current donload and upload speed ?
[03:49] <Hannibal> does that make sense? the generated thing is much longer.
[03:49] <kling0n> Hannibal:  IIRC there are som issues with the automatic scripts thouhg
[03:50] <Omarpb> then soundray? what can I do?
[03:50] <biotrox> heheh so i must download the full ubuntu CD v6.10 first, yeah..?
[03:50] <soundray> Omarpb: what I told you before. Recover with a Windows boot CD
[03:50] <kling0n>         ssid="bing"
[03:50] <kling0n>         #psk="testterte"
[03:50] <kling0n>         psk=be9f87769b1d6681747ec0a5a435bdca5180cba793d3f3b8ab4f7dd53e8c360e
[03:50] <kling0n> }
[03:50] <biotrox> if update oke lah.. but need to install base program first :P
[03:50] <Dimensions> thanks biotrox but how to get it ... tried with apt but can't find package ...
[03:50] <lemonsCC> dimensions this is from the liveCD?
[03:51] <Omarpb> I tried do that before
[03:51] <kling0n> Hannibal:  are you sure it's wpa-psk?
[03:51] <Omarpb> and doest fix
[03:51] <Dimensions> lemonsCC:  yes from live cd ...
[03:51] <kling0n> 26 chars is normally WEP
[03:51] <Omarpb> doesn't work sorry
[03:51] <teto> hi everyone
[03:51] <soundray> Omarpb: is this an NTFS partition?
[03:51] <Hannibal> kling0n: my wireless config on the router says it is WPA-PSK2 / WPA-PSK
[03:51] <biotrox> if i do the installation to update from internet that my internet quota will be exceeded and i must pay much much expensive
[03:51] <lemonsCC> dimensions http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man8/parted.8.html may help
[03:51] <Omarpb> yes, It is NTFS
[03:51] <Dimensions> lemonsCC:  tried both while running setup from live cd and without running it too . from system --> gparted ..
[03:52] <lemonsCC> you need to know more details but the concept is the same
[03:52] <kling0n> hannibal perhaps its a 26 char string pass?
[03:52] <Hannibal> kling0n: it has a separate option for WEP, so I'd assume it's wrong
[03:52] <kling0n> Hannibal:  what is the output?
[03:52] <Hannibal> er
[03:52] <Hannibal> s/wrong/not wep/
[03:52] <lemonsCC> from system wont work....liveCd is best
[03:52] <Hannibal> kling0n: of what?
[03:52] <rexbron> hi, is it possible to resize your root parition and home partition (niether of them are extended)?
[03:52] <Hannibal> wpa_supplicant starting?
=== SteveC is now known as ssssss
[03:52] <kling0n> you mentioned it fails to parse the config
[03:52] <teto> Does someone know how to use bootchart here ?
[03:52] <kling0n> the config needs to be well formed
[03:52] <biotrox> Dimensions | cfdisk is a linux utility... don't need to apt-get it
[03:52] <DARKGuy> What's the command to start the automounter - or to mount an USB pendrive/MP3 ?
[03:52] <Omarpb> yes, It is NTFS soundray
[03:52] <soundray> Omarpb: you could try the utility testdisk
[03:52] <zigford> rexbron: I think its possible but must be done from a live CD
[03:52] <teto> cos I 'm in trooble using it under ubuntu
[03:53] <kling0n> Hannibal:  you might try enclosing the hax string in ""
[03:53] <Hannibal> Line 22: invalid psk 'b123<stuff>34a'
[03:53] <soundray> !testdisk | Omarpb
[03:53] <biotrox> just run it from your gnome -terminal | dimensions
[03:53] <Hannibal> ok.
[03:53] <ubotu> testdisk: Partition scanner and disk recovery tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 6.4.1-1 (edgy), package size 459 kB, installed size 1232 kB
[03:53] <Dimensions> lemonsCC:  i mean to say when i boot into liveCD ... and run install and partition aswell as boot with cd instead of running Install from menu of liveCD ...
[03:53] <lemonsCC> biotrox he is trying to use gparted
[03:53] <zigford> rexbron: not sure if the ubuntu live CD can do it, but I know knoppix can
[03:53] <kling0n> hannibal if my guess is correct it *is* a 26 char password
[03:53] <rexbron> zigford: both gparted and qtparted will me format, but not resize
[03:53] <Hannibal> kling0n: that seems to at least try
[03:53] <soundray> Omarpb: I have never used this, though, and won't be able to help
[03:53] <kling0n> hannibal but it wont accept it as a wpa-psk since that would be 65 chars
[03:53] <Hannibal> hrm, but now it connected to my home machine still
[03:53] <kling0n> hehe
[03:54] <Omarpb> I tried to fix it with that program, I could not fix it
[03:54] <zigford> rexbron: Also, knoppix and resize ext3, but it cannot move
[03:54] <lemonsCC> dimension i would say try again
[03:54] <repete> Good morning
[03:54] <lemonsCC> dimension i have never had issues with gparted
[03:54] <biotrox> lemonCC | ya i know....
[03:54] <kling0n> hannibal you'll need to run wpa_supplicant
[03:54] <Hannibal> I know.
[03:54] <Hannibal> I did that
[03:54] <lemonsCC> dimension except low memory machines
[03:54] <soundray> Omarpb: then your partition is borked and you'll have to reinstall Windows.
[03:54] <Hannibal> but it has an entry for no encryption networks
[03:54] <kling0n> hannibal the script can be a bit strange, so i'd suggest running it manually
[03:54] <Hannibal> I have :)
[03:55] <kling0n> Hannibal:  wpa_supplicant -i <interface> -B -C /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
[03:55] <kling0n> or something like that
[03:55] <kling0n> the use wpa_cli
[03:55] <Omarpb> then I cant save the files?
[03:55] <lemonsCC> soundray:  yay for windows and its borkness
[03:55] <kling0n> to check the status
[03:55] <kling0n> the?then
[03:55] <Omarpb> then I cant save the files, soundray?
[03:55] <Hannibal> kling0n: hrm, I just have it without the -B
[03:55] <Hannibal> and then it just dumps lots of shit :)
[03:55] <rexbron> zigford: is it possible to resize a partition (make it smaller) then merge the free space into another partition?
[03:55] <kling0n> woo shit!!
[03:55] <Hannibal> I suppose your way is probably better though.
[03:55] <soundray> Omarpb: I can't see a way. You could still ask for help in ##windows
[03:55] <kling0n> wpa_cli gives you more meaningful output
[03:55] <athomas> Hello everybody. I use ubuntu for several years. I have a probleme that I can't solve. I have a toshiba M70-168 laptop with ubuntu edgy eft. All is good, but the touchad scroll does'nt work. Can you help me please ?
[03:56] <kling0n> Hannibal:  hint: "status"
[03:56] <kling0n> Hannibal:  you might have to run it sudo though
=== taylor is now known as LookTJ
[03:56] <zigford> rexbron: It sure is possible, the merging partitions _must_ sit next to each other though, because of the limitation the ext3 cannot be moved
=== LookTJ is now known as looktj1
[03:56] <soundray> lemonsCC: you must forgive windows for not working when you overwrite the first 512 bytes of its boot partition ;)
[03:56] <kling0n> athomas:  paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log to pastebin
[03:56] <Dimensions> thanks biotrox i guess we resize it with Units ? how do i specify size for it there ? there isn't any option like edit or resize
[03:56] <biotrox> lemonCC | what restricted means in /etc/apt/source.list...?
[03:56] <my_haz> how do you have a script run only once when you start up AND only if you are on the Internet?
[03:57] <rexbron> zigford: They are next to each other
[03:57] <Hannibal> kling0n: it's still connecting to some other dumb network around >:-(
[03:57] <kling0n> lemonsCC:  run the windows install disk in repair mode and run BOOTFIX
[03:57] <lemonsCC> soundray:  thats all usless anyhow...i mean its only 512 bytes =P
[03:57] <kling0n> hannibal in wpa_cli: run list
[03:57] <zigford> rexbron: Then you should be good to go. It can even resize ntfs/vfat
[03:57] <lemonsCC> kling0n what is the difference?
[03:57] <xi_> hmm
[03:57] <xi_> hi
[03:57] <kling0n> lemonsCC:  bootfix is not a full install :)
[03:57] <lemonsCC> lol
[03:57] <xi_> does anybody know how to fix a sound problem?
[03:58] <xi_> my mic doesn't work :(
[03:58] <kling0n> lemonscc it might be FIXBOOT though
[03:58] <soundray> my_haz: add it to the directory /etc/network/if-up.d/ and edit it to set a flag that stops it from running if it has been run before in the same session.
[03:58] <Hannibal> mm, now it's just "scanning"
[03:58] <lemonsCC> biotrox restricted may be illegal in some countries(i think)
[03:58] <my_haz> thanks soundray
[03:58] <kling0n> hannibal if you can get an ip from that one.. connect to it and apt-get install gnome-network-manager
[03:58] <kling0n> :)
[03:58] <kling0n> Hannibal:  which is *lots* easier :)
[03:58] <lemonsCC> biotrox i ignore that and uncomment everything
[03:59] <soundray> my_haz: it's not ntpdate by any chance?

[04:13] <starz> anyone you tell to make install anything have em use checkinstall

[04:29] <Deano_TM> ?
[04:29] <jhford> ubuntu is just better
[04:29] <neobyte420> i have some more questions
[04:30] <soundray> slicky: sorry, can't help. Maybe install dvgrab and pickup hints from there.
[04:30] <jhford> the package management is the key feature to me
[04:30] <harfooz> my_haz, indeed my good friend! Nothing makes grading finals go as well as listening to the barking dogs rendition of Jingle Bells

[04:33] <haxality> hello
[04:33] <DJAdmira1> hello
[04:34] <my_haz> harfooz: sick sick man, so how does one go about download the all stuff needed for an LTS and then go home and install it?
[04:34] <haxality> I've been having a really weird problem with my display
[04:34] <cld2> ismail: you really only need 2-3 . /boot is for storing your kernel and realted booting stuff, swap is for paging when the computer runs out of ram and / or "root" is like the c: drive everything gets stored under there
[04:34] <starscalling> when in windows with dual monitors on my nvidia fx5200 i can get good resoultions of 1880x1400 + 1600x1200; but on that same vid card in linux i can only do 1280x960+1280x960
[04:34] <haxality> seemingly at random, my screen becomes garbled with all these vertical lines
[04:34] <kling0n> DJAdmira1:  what is the output if that last check?
[04:34] <starscalling> any reason it has to be such a lower resolution in linux ???
[04:34] <DJAdmira1> kling0n: I didn't execute it. I don't know what that does.
[04:34] <kling0n> DJAdmira1:  do all the originals some out as "data" ?
[04:34] <haxality> There is on rhyme or reason to when it happens
[04:34] <soundray> MarcN, harfooz: I used Red Hat ages ago, and I use Mandrake 10 at work. I just find Ubuntu so much easier...
[04:35] <haxality> my screen just randomly becomes completely garbled
[04:35] <TheGateKeeper> my_haz, I thing you want the 'alternate' cd
[04:35] <kling0n> DJAdmira1:  simply a loop to go through all the files :)
[04:35] <ismail> cld2: but when u install linux it makes 3 partions...
[04:35] <harfooz> my_haz, hmmm...how about this: apt-cache search streamripper. Make a note of the output for which packages are needed.
[04:35] <TheGateKeeper> think*
[04:35] <cld2> ismail: other then that anything else is optional, /usr is where user installed programs go, /var is where logs and system messages get put, /home is obvious
[04:35] <kling0n> DJAdmira1:  to save you  some typing :)
[04:35] <soundray> MarcN, harfooz: even Debian...
[04:35] <DJAdmira1> kling0n: but what does it do with each file?
[04:35] <harfooz> Then download the .deb files needed.
[04:35] <neobyte420> wow...kubuntu is 400 MB
[04:35] <cld2> ismail: which 3? /boot / and ? swap or /usr ?
[04:35] <kling0n> DJAdmira1:  runs the "file" utility on uit
[04:35] <kling0n> it
[04:35] <ismail> i think so
[04:35] <my_haz> TheGateKeeper: you can update from CD? Cool
[04:35] <harfooz> then save all the .deb files to a USB drive/CD and take them home with you.
[04:35] <kling0n> DJAdmira1:  to get the filetype
[04:35] <ismail> cant remember
[04:35] <DJAdmira1> kling0n: All of the mdfs are data.

[04:40] <screechingcat> kling0n: no i need it more for compressing, encoding video
[04:40] <ryanakca> kling0n: or wait... apt-get update fetches the stuff, but when it finishes fetching it sigsevs

[04:40] <kling0n> DJAdmira1: i'd go look for the mdf2iso devs
[04:40] <fbc> If I wanted BOGOFILTER to filter my evolution mail. all I have to do is install the bogofilter-common?
[04:40] <ryanakca> my_haz: apt-get source packagename               ... no need for sudo, and it goes to the working directory

[04:41] <my_haz> ryanakca: thanks
[04:41] <kling0n> ryanakca: maybe locate the libc6 deb package and use " dpkg -i "

[04:41] <ryanakca> kling0n: kk, I'll let you know if it works
[04:41] <kling0n> DJAdmira1: yeah.. but i'd guess you'd have more success finding out why it's not working by asking them
[04:42] <ismail> how can i request a special feature in ubuntu
[04:42] <fbc> kling0n:  Do you know much about bogofilter and evolution?
[04:42] <kling0n> fbc not a lot
[04:42] <kling0n> fbc but a little :)
[04:42] <ismail> i find the bluetooth setup very messy
[04:42] <DJAdmira1> kling0n: I think I'll just try and figure out something on a winmachine.
[04:42] <kling0n> fbc you'd perhaps be better off asking in #evolution
[04:42] <ismail> id like to see a gui for the bt setup

[04:51] <screechingcat> emilia DO NOT REBOOT
[04:51] <davascript_work> why is  emilia rebooting
[04:51] <Z3dzDead> Most possibly a stupid question: but is it necessary to have a 'twinview' capable nvidia card or two Graphics Cards for dualhead/xinerama to work?
[04:51] <lemonsCC> someone tell her
[04:51] <kling0n> recent switch, I'd guess :)
[04:51] <ryanakca> screechingcat: lol, too late :P
[04:51] <lemonsCC> shes windozified
[04:51] <kling0n> lols
[04:52] <Z3dzDead> I've just got one and was pipe-dreaming that I could get one card to show up on two monitors about an hour ago.
[04:52] <screechingcat> ryanakca: yeah. windozed
[04:52] <lemonsCC> emilia no need to reboot on trivial stuff like this
[04:52] <emilia> ok i only logged off and back in
[04:52] <lemonsCC> lol ok
[04:52] <emilia> but stillt he same error
[04:52] <emilia> it says .dmrc is being ignored
[04:52] <kling0n> my server config is actually semi-broken after an upgrade so now I have to manually runs stuff whenever it boots
[04:52] <lemonsCC> ooo
[04:52] <lemonsCC> wrong UID i think
[04:52] <kling0n> so I *never* do
[04:52] <davascript_work> err
[04:52] <lemonsCC> i had that issue
[04:53] <MeisterZopf> Z3dzDead, twinview is for 2 monitors on one gfx card. if you have 2 gfx cards you have to use ximerama
[04:53] <ryanakca> screechingcat: my parents are still brainwashed into thinking that it's bad to leave a computer running for more than a couple hours at a time.. dunno why...

[04:53] <Hexidigital> ryanakca: tell them it uses more power turning it on and off then leaving it on all day
[04:53] <screechingcat> ryanakca: well, my parents dont know that my comp is on all the time.
[04:53] <Z3dzDead> MeisterZopf: Well I've got an old nvidia card- whats it a FX series- AGP.

[04:54] <lemonsCC> ignore the above one
[04:54] <screechingcat> ryanakca: kernel upgrades are an exception. but they're so rare.
[04:54] <lemonsCC> are you typing sudo?
[04:54] <emilia> too late i already did it :)
[04:54] <ryanakca> Hexidigital: and that it wrecks your hard drive... hot cold hot cold hot cold... start stop start stop etc

[05:26] <zylche> us sucks, use uk
[05:26] <sabayonuser> swiftfeet8:  no, I don't see one.
[05:26] <Artemis3> US international means using dead keys

[05:31] <ryanakca> I have an old debian woody install CD, for network installs... can I install ubuntu with it?
[05:31] <TheGateKeeper> tundejeg, when you put a cd in your drive it should be automounted so there should be no need to specifically mount it
[05:32] <reverseblade> hildolfur, there is something I am not sure  that I couldn't decide if I should use STI or act_as_tee, I am confused which one would be a better strategy to go
[05:32] <linuxd00d> ryanacka, Ubuntu is based on debian, it is not the actual operating system itself
[05:32] <hildolfur> ok, explain
[05:32] <reverseblade> hildolfur, my constrain is I have products, and sub categories and sub categories and so o n
[05:32] <tundejeg_> i cant access my cd rom despite using DF
[05:32] <tundejeg_> who will assist me pls
[05:33] <tundejeg_> to resolve this
[05:33] <hildolfur> reverseblade: we should switch to ubunut I think
[05:33] <linuxd00d> ryanacka, either download the latest version via torrent, or... order the cd via shippit
[05:33] <hildolfur> lol to rails channel
[05:33] <reverseblade> hildolfur, for example , I have products, bricks and Ceramic Fibers are products, Ceramic Fiber Textiles, Ceramic Fiber Blankets are Ceramic Fibers ,and ISOWOOL is a Ceramic Fiber blanket. SO I have a tree like structure, but should I implement this with acts_as_tree or STI. I am stuck

[05:34] <reverseblade> hildolfur, what do you mean, ubuntu ?
[05:35] <kling0n> tundejeg_: mount/cdrom0 /mount/point

[05:35] <reverseblade> oh :)
[05:35] <kling0n> tundejeg_: there needs to be a space between them
[05:35] <swiftfeet8> How do I submit a bug to Ubuntu?

[05:50] <frying_fish> rkvirani: what version are you using currently?
[05:50] <rkvirani> 6.06
[05:50] <sabrebutt> Does anybody know how to fix grub-related issues with dual-boots?
[05:50] <frying_fish> well in that case there is a newer version available.
[05:50] <rkvirani> err it keeps asking me to upgrade to 6.10 and I follow the upgrade path but then it asks me the next day!
[05:51] <zigford> Thialfihar: it is updating dynamic on mine
[05:51] <Thialfihar> O RLY!
[05:51] <Thialfihar> Hmm. Any idea why this could be?
[05:51] <upd> eany one give me bnc free?
[05:51] <Thialfihar> Perhaps I have to enable or disable something?
[05:52] <quiet> how do i fix this thing with vim inserting A,B,C,D   if I'm in INSERT mode and use the arrow keys to move around??
[05:52] <gopss> unsure
[05:52] <cntb> sabrebutt:

[05:54] <rkvirani> Does anyone have any ideas on fixing this?

[05:54] <zigford> Thialfihar: works out of the box for me
[05:55] <zigford> Thialfihar: dynamic cpu has to be supported by you computer tho
[05:55] <zigford> Thialfihar: what is your comp?
[05:55] <sabrebutt> cntb thanks, but I'm wondering if instead of going through that, I can edit the options within grub? Grub loads but doesn't see my ubuntu install, just fedora

[05:56] <Thialfihar> Got a P4 3.0GHz
[05:56] <zigford> rkvirani: Never seen that one before.
[05:57] <zigford> Thialfihar: Maybe it only does dynamic frequency scaling on laptops??
[05:57] <zigford> Thialfihar: what did you overclock to?
[05:58] <jurgen> Hi... anyone where who can tell me how I get Apache/PHP/MySQL running easily on Ubuntu desktop version? (I've got the 6.10 desktop, but want to set a local server for testing websites)
[05:58] <Thialfihar> Nothing specific. That's why I want to detect the speed.
[05:58] <rebell> .
[05:58] <Thialfihar> My motherboard has some AI technologies or other, which overclock depending on workload, apparently. I haven't tried it before.
[05:58] <Thialfihar> And I only enabled that, so didn't set a speed or anything.
[05:58] <noodles12> in kdevelop how would u make the bottom screen into two separates ones like the visual studios ui?
[05:59] <docwhat> Anyone having trouble with SASL recently?
[05:59] <zigford> Thialfihar: hmm, I see,  Well, cpuinfo doesn't lie.  For example on my lappy, when I;m just chatting away here, cpuinfo says 800mhz
[06:00] <zigford> Thialfihar: when I start zipping a file or somthing, it jumps up to 1.8ghz
[06:00] <Thialfihar> Ah, might be frequency scaling, then.
[06:00] <Thialfihar> That's not supported by mine, methinks. And the thing that scales it for you prolly updates the cpuinfo accordingly?
[06:01] <rkvirani> Does anyone have a stock sources-list for ubuntu 6.10?
[06:01] <winand> How do you extract a .exe file using p7zip?
[06:01] <rkvirani> perhaps if someone could post it I could try that
[06:01] <laurent__> irc://irc.mozilla.org/xulfr
[06:01] <blackhero> hi all =)
[06:01] <cntb> good idea sabrebutt
[06:01] <zigford> Thialfihar: /proc is a dynamic filesystem the represents current hardware/software/kernel settings, so cpuinfo gets updated because /proc is part of the kernel
[06:02] <zigford> Thialfihar: its like asking the kernel what its doing now, but its represented in a filesystem
[06:02] <Thialfihar> Yeh, but if you get numbers like 800MHz and 1.8GHz, then that sounds far too round. Prolly just scaling factors.
[06:03] <Thialfihar> And I believe you that it then takes whatever the system is set to, but it's certainly not a detected speed.
[06:03] <zigford> Thialfihar: thats just the scaling factors that my cpu supports.
[06:03] <Thialfihar> Aye.
[06:03] <Thialfihar> Exactly what I mean.
[06:03] <DShepherd> hey.. there tons of updates today...
[06:03] <quiet> can anyone tell me how enable arrow-key navigation in vim under INSERT mode??

[06:04] <Thialfihar> I wanna try this "bogomips", why was it dropped from the sysutils package and how can I get it?
[06:06] <ubitux> hi
[06:06] <jurgen> localhost
[06:06] <jurgen> oops
[06:06] <zigford> Thialfihar: you can still see the current bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo |grep bogomips
[06:07] <Thialfihar> But that was done only once.
[06:07] <Thialfihar> The number is static.
[06:07] <zigford> Thialfihar: your right
[06:07] <startswithz> what software do I need to paly dvds?
[06:08] <startswithz> the movie player on my computer doesn't seem to be working

[06:12] <J4kch> Not an option =)
[06:12] <startswithz> Package libdvdcss2 is not available, but is referred to by another package.

[06:15] <J4kch> swiftfeet8, how do I do that?
[06:15] <Airwulf> with ubunutu/gnome?

[06:20] <swiftfeet8> ah, ok
[06:21] <swiftfeet8> is there some sort of defects on the CD, or is it in a proprietary format?
[06:21] <biotrox> wow i just try to run automatix
[06:21] <biotrox> think it's great
[06:22] <squidly> hello im trying to get ubuntu installed from apt-get and its not finding it..has it been removed or something?
[06:22] <tonyyarusso> !automatix
[06:22] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[06:22] <squidly> !webmin
[06:22] <ubotu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
[06:22] <squidly> ok that explins it
[06:22] <squidly> any recomendations for a replacement for webmin?
[06:23] <zigford> strange, webmin supports debian
[06:23] <squidly> yea tell me about it ><
[06:23] <swiftfeet8> !libesd-alsa0
[06:23] <ubotu> libesd-alsa0: Enlightened Sound Daemon (ALSA) - Shared libraries. In component main, is extra. Version 0.2.36-3ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 19 kB, installed size 92 kB
[06:25] <swiftfeet8> why if I try to remove libesd-alsa0 does it say it will free up 237M of space?
[06:26] <DShepherd> swiftfeet8: because 237M on your harddrive is being used by that package. So if you remove it that space will no longer be used
[06:26] <swiftfeet8> but isn't the package 19k?
[06:26] <drkm> what is the minium about of space i should have a partition to install ubuntu to?
[06:26] <DShepherd> swiftfeet8: i dont know .. is it?
[06:27] <DShepherd> drkm: about 4GB is about minimum
[06:27] <apokryphos> drkm: the least I'd go is around 6/7 gigs
[06:27] <stojance> I need a dock like the OS X dock for gnome. KXDocker and KoolDock don't work alltough I have nVidia installed
[06:27] <apokryphos> default install is just under 2 gigs though
[06:27] <drkm> ah ok
[06:27] <shriphani> could someone guide me with choosing a good file manager ?
[06:28] <apokryphos> shriphani: yup. Switch to KDE, use Konqueror.
[06:28] <cyber_brain_mfkg> how can i see my internet ip address? my brother want to access my computer using ssh and he needs my ip
[06:28] <Slart> shriphani: the standard one isn't working for you?
[06:28] <shriphani> i am using fluxbox
[06:28] <apokryphos> cyber_brain_mfkg: whatismyip.com
[06:28] <cyber_brain_mfkg> thanx
[06:29] <diiba> omthing really wierd happened with my main computer, after using apollon I run a command it left  behind (didn't actually know what it would do) and all shared files flashed (as a list) in the terminal, and the hard drive filled up, wierd I thought and rebooted, and I could nt log in for some unknown reason, and I ctrl+alt+f1 :ed and tryed to solve the problem in the commandline.
[06:29] <diiba> Unfortunately my hardrive really IS full
[06:29] <diiba> And I can't really do anything
[06:29] <tonyyarusso> apokryphos: I think a default install is actually just over 2 gig these days.  I heard 2.1 - just hearsay though.
[06:29] <diiba> And the -bash_history is empty so I dont know what to fix
[06:29] <shriphani> Slart, it is. but the last time i opened nautilus the background changed to the default ubuntu background and caused the slit to disappear
[06:29] <diiba> Any clues?
[06:30] <apokryphos> tonyyarusso: I think 1.8 gigs is still the quoted amount
[06:30] <apokryphos> tonyyarusso: you can't fit much more than that from one CD with .debs, I believe
[06:30] <computermc> I installed 1.10 and the screen resolution if 800X600 and it kind of looks fuzzy. I thought I would go in and change the resolution, but it only gives me 800by600 and 640by480. How do I get other resolutions to choose from?
[06:30] <Slart> shriphani: ah.. well.. I can't really remember what debian used before nautilus.. sawfish or something.. .
[06:30] <jrib> diiba: maybe 'sudo apt-get clean' will give you enough space to login
[06:30] <tonyyarusso> apokryphos: Could be.  I just tell be three to be safe ;)
[06:30] <diiba> TY
[06:31] <neobyte420> how do i load kde insteed of gnome in ubuntu?
[06:31] <shriphani> Slart, how good is rox-filer ?
[06:31] <Slart> neobyte420: isn't KDE in the synaptic thingy?
[06:31] <neobyte420> i already got kde through apt-get
[06:31] <archangelpetro> could someone help me? I'm having difficulty writing to my USB pen, i tried it before and it worked.. but since i loaded it and manipulated it from a windows machine i seem to be unable to write anything?
[06:31] <Slart> shriphani: I have no idea.. I've only used the old debian-one and Nautilus on ubuntu
[06:31] <neobyte420> i want to load it
[06:32] <neobyte420> im in gnome now
[06:32] <computermc> I installed 1.10 and the screen resolution if 800X600 and it kind of looks fuzzy. I thought I would go in and change the resolution, but it only gives me 800by600 and 640by480. How do I get other resolutions to choose from?
[06:32] <kmaynard> shriphani, have you tried thunar?
[06:32] <shriphani> neobyte420, at the login screen you should see options at the bottom left. there is an option to select session in the
[06:32] <shriphani> there ^
[06:32] <Slart> computermc: you installed v1.10 of what?
[06:32] <shriphani> kmaynard, the xfce file manager ?
[06:32] <computermc> Slart, ubuntu
[06:33] <Slart> computermc: not 6.10??
[06:33] <kmaynard> shriphani, yup
[06:33] <neobyte420> ok ty
[06:33] <squidly> how can I install a .deb I downloaded?
[06:33] <computermc> Slart, sorry, yes it was 6.10
[06:33] <shriphani> kmaynard, no other choices ?
[06:33] <computermc> wrong number
[06:33] <Henke> any body here got the "php" lines to put in the apache config file?
[06:33] <Slart> squidly: dpg -i mydeb.deb I think
[06:33] <shriphani> squidly, dpkg -i blah.deb
[06:33] <cyber_brain_mfkg> should i create accaunt before my brother connects on my machine via ssh?and how to do that???
[06:33] <neobyte420> ty shriphani
[06:34] <neobyte420> that worked
[06:34] <squidly> thanks
[06:34] <kmaynard> shriphani, i'm sure there's others, but that was the first that came to mind
[06:34] <HuibertGill> diiba: apollon is a p2p programm, right?
[06:34] <mumbles> how do i start the remeot viweing softare remotley using ssh ?
[06:34] <shriphani> kmaynard, oh
[06:34] <Slart> computermc: ah.. then it makes more sense =) you have to setup xorg for your videocard.. what are you using? nvidia? ati?
[06:34] <kmaynard> shriphani, have you tried thunar?
[06:34] <HuibertGill> diiba: did you let it run as root?
[06:34] <shriphani> kmaynard, i was using xubuntu sometime back
[06:34] <shriphani> i did then
[06:34] <computermc> Slart, I'm not sure, how I would I find out?
[06:34] <shriphani> it gave me no trash though.
[06:35] <kmaynard> shriphani, whats wrong with nautilus?
[06:35] <Slart> computermc: hold on..
[06:35] <computermc> Slart, its a old gateway solo laptop
[06:35] <computermc> Slart, ok
[06:35] <Henke> any body here got the "php" lines to put in the apache config file?
[06:35] <shriphani> kmaynard, well i opened nautilus last and god knows how but the background changed to that of the gnome session and i couldnt see the slit
[06:35] <cyber_brain_mfkg> should i create accaunt before my brother connects on my machine?and how to do that???
[06:35] <rpc> hmm what should i enter when anonymous CVS asks me for a password on login?
[06:36] <startswithz> I followed the guides from Ubuntu's web page but it still says I cannot play dvds because I do not have the appropriate plug in
[06:36] <Slart> computermc: I'm kind of new to ubuntu myself.. but try typing lspci at a terminal and search for something that looks like a graphics adapter
[06:36] <kmaynard> shriphani, what desktop?
[06:36] <startswithz> what's going on?
[06:36] <rexbron> hello, could anyone tell me WHY mjpegtools is in multiverse?
[06:36] <Slart> rexbron: perhaps it isn't free opensource?
[06:37] <billstei> Anybody using the Sis761 chipset/mb's with linux/ubuntu ?
[06:37] <rexbron> Slart: the package says the code is GLP
[06:37] <kmaynard> shriphani, try nautilus --no-desktop
[06:37] <diiba> God this is awful.
[06:37] <Slart> rexbron: ok.. then I'm interested in the answer aswell =)
[06:37] <diiba> haven't got wnough space to login, even after removing some programs
[06:37] <rexbron> Slart: GPL rather
[06:37] <diiba> This bash history is empty?!
[06:37] <diiba> Hd full.
[06:37] <diiba> ALL full.
[06:37] <rexbron> from what I can tell, there is no listing of WHY a package is put into multiverse
[06:37] <trurl> Henke, go to /etc/apache2/mods-enabled and create a link to the php-mod in /etc/apache2/mods-available
[06:38] <rexbron> I am going to ask on -motu
[06:38] <diiba> And some files needing to recover.
[06:38] <startswithz> can someone give me real help? the guides aren't helping me.  I mean I love the links but I've done what it says and no dice
[06:38] <diiba> How d oyou burn files with cdrecord?
[06:38] <archangelpetro> can nobody help? writing to an USB pen?
[06:38] <tryggvib> rexbron: I believe it gets put there because of a bad license
[06:38] <tryggvib> and by bad license I mean non-free license
[06:38] <Slart> archangelpetro: I've used several usb-memory-thingies and I haven't seen that problem
[06:38] <HuibertGill> startswithz: did you try gxine as player, like it said in the guide?
[06:38] <mumbles> damm
[06:39] <rexbron> tryggvib: The package says the code is GPL...

[06:39] <Slart> archangelpetro: I've written and read them using windows and ubuntu without a problem
[06:39] <archangelpetro> Slart, i dont really understand why i cant write, it's  allows me to copy everything and do anything i need to  but then when i take it out and replace it.. the files arent there.
[06:39] <computermc> Slart, would this be it...
[06:39] <startswithz> no I feel foolish
[06:39] <biotrox> !repositories
[06:39] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[06:39] <HuibertGill> startswithz: ......, then try that first, please
[06:39] <tryggvib> rexbron: then I just don't know... you should ask some maintainer, like for example a MOTU
[06:39] <rexbron> tryggvib: ok
[06:40] <Slart> archangelpetro: I dont either.. never seen that before.. I would try reformatting the drive and trying again.. but that's just a wild guess

[06:42] <trurl> Henke: php4.conf and php4.load
[06:42] <Slart> computermc: nice.. there should be some kind of readme on how to get it working too

[06:45] <apokryphos> gah, that's annoying
[06:46] <trurl> Henke: then look in php5.conf and check the extensions (.php and/or .php5 or smth like that)

[06:47] <davascript_work> Dimensions: you will have to boot to a livecd like knoppix, insert, gentoolivecd anything that can get you to a prompt
[06:47] <davascript_work> or tell the windows bootloader to boot your grub partition
[06:47] <davascript_work> and you will have to install grub to the mbr of the disk not edit menu.lst
[06:47] <Dimensions> davascript_work: how to do that ?
[06:48] <davascript_work> grub --no-floppy
[06:48] <davascript_work> setup (hd0,0)
[06:48] <Dimensions> how do i tell my windows to do that i mean ? and where
[06:48] <Henke> turl: they both look the same
[06:48] <davascript_work> root (hd0,0)
[06:48] <davascript_work> it would be easier to boot to a livecd
[06:48] <Dimensions> and then write those commands or what ?
[06:48] <davascript_work> insert is a small one
[06:48] <Dimensions> ahhan
[06:49] <trurl> Henke: its 'trurl' ;) every line containing 'trurl' is beeing highlighted... so...
[06:49] <davascript_work> well run grub-install /dev/hdX      X being your drive letter
[06:49] <shorty_> can someone tell me the command for the "log out" button?
[06:49] <trurl> Henke: and whats your problem with php then?
[06:50] <Slart> shorty_: I have a logout command.. I don't know if that's the one.. and I don't want to ttest it now =)
[06:50] <inc3rt_c0in> someone know a alternative to amaranth's repos.?
[06:50] <Dimensions> and then davascript_work thats it ?
[06:50] <dustin> can anybody tell me what the default mozilla folder is.. the plugin folder

[07:01] <Henke> trurl: LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so
[07:02] <Slart> archangelpetro: hmm.. but you could unmount it without errors?
[07:02] <trurl> Henke: is this module there?
[07:02] <Slart> archangelpetro: can you run fsck on it?

[07:03] <elementz> TheGateKeeper: somehow it won't let me save my configuration when i uncheck the format option
[07:03] <elementz> any clues--???
[07:03] <dyz> Oh this doesnt look good
[07:03] <D_Cent> my computer was set to "standby", how can i "wake" it up?
[07:03] <dyz> I installed the driver it says I need for beryl, and the boot up screen looks wierd.
[07:03] <HuibertGill> dyz: what happened?
[07:04] <Henke> trurl: jepp it's there
[07:04] <archangelpetro> Slart, it says it's not ext2 which is true cuz it's fat32... but ?
[07:04] <HuibertGill> dyz: wieird as in?
[07:05] <dyz> HuibertGill: Half of it was missing
[07:05] <dyz> HuibertGill: Luckily its just the boot up screen, the desktop appears to look fine
[07:05] <Slart> archangelpetro: ok.. and there isn't any weird automounting going on?
[07:05] <TheGateKeeper> elementz, have you tried to chroot in ?
[07:05] <KenSentMe> What package do i need to make gparted create ntfs partitions?
[07:05] <tFF> i have installed ubuntu-server with english locale. then i have to install another one but "dpkg-reconfigure locales" doesn't prompt for locales. it just sais "generating en_us.utg... complete..." that's it... how to add another locale? thanx
[07:05] <elementz> TheGateKeeper: huh?
[07:06] <trurl> Henke: strange...
[07:06] <archangelpetro> Slart, it does auto mount .. but im not sure how to stop that?
[07:06] <HuibertGill> dyz: so, beryl working? with the opensource drivers?
[07:06] <abo> when I plug my digital cam into my pc.. Dapper used to mount it automatically, in Edgy I need to mount it manually, is that normal? can this be fixed?
[07:06] <trurl> Henke: please do 'touch /var/www/phpinfo.php'
[07:07] <Henke> ok

[07:07] <Henke> trurl: ok
[07:07] <Slart> archangelpetro: I don't know what the automounting software is called.. didn't see anything on my ubuntu system that looked possible
[07:07] <trurl> Henke: 'cat > /var/www/phpinfo.php (return) <?php phpinfo(); ?> (ctrl+c)'

[07:09] <Henke> trurl: ok
[07:09] <Henke> trurl: done i mean
[07:10] <dyz> Ok, so in linux, after you add a repository, all you do is run apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade to install whatever is in it?
[07:11] <saxin> dyz: yes, you may use sudo before those commands tho
[07:11] <trurl> Henke: mh...
[07:12] <dyz> saxin: I do, I just thought that would be a given.
[07:12] <dyz> Im new.

[07:12] <dyz> What does sudo mean anyways?
[07:12] <jbroome> su do
[07:12] <Josh420> dyz: super-user do

[07:17] <SilentDis> dyz:  i hang out here a lot, esp. when i'm installing stuff, gets boring otherwise, and i like to help :)
[07:18] <TheGateKeeper> elementz, I think sda3 == root   (hd0,2)  not absolutely sure
[07:18] <trurl> Henke: err... there must be a log somewhere ;)
[07:18] <trurl> Henke: check the directory /var/log/apache2 for logfiles
[07:18] <Slart> SilentDis: you can download the driver from the nvidia-site.... it comes with a nice install script.. it worked perfect for me
[07:18] <Henke> trurl: i'll check if i can find any
[07:18] <dyz> SilentDis: Want to help me get beryl running with that SVN you gave me a link to yesterday in the beryl channel?
[07:18] <SilentDis> slart:  oh cool, url?
[07:19] <Slart> SilentDis: www.nvidia.org.. download linux etc etc
[07:19] <SilentDis> dyz:  i haven't been in the #ubuntu-xgl channel in a long time
[07:19] <Slart> SilentDis: or nvidia.com
[07:19] <SilentDis> slart:  thanks.  if the installer is easy to follow, that'll work just fine :)
[07:19] <dyz> SilentDis: I swear it was you that helped my in #beryl yesterday
[07:19] <SilentDis> dyz:  nope not me, sorry
[07:20] <dyz> Ooh, I think I got it working

[07:20] <SilentDis> slart: sweet.  last I looked at the binary blob on their site was a long time ago, and it had a LOT of problems :P
[07:21] <frying_fish> Henke: /var/log/apache2 that is where you are looking yes?
[07:21] <Slart> SilentDis: yes.. I tried it before and it was more trouble than it was worth.. but now it was actually easier than doing it through synaptic

[07:22] <Slart> knithx: it did that for me too... I had to disconnect an external USB DVD-drive.. then it worked
=== LookTJ is now known as lookt
[07:23] <SilentDis> kinthx:  have you tried booting in 'safe vid' mode from the cd?  or, as slart suggested, make sure usb stuff is not connected?
[07:23] <Henke> trurl: now i am,and there are 2 files one named accsess and one error
[07:23] <knithx> Slart: I only have the Mouse connected by USB
[07:23] <frying_fish> knithx: try pressing ctrl+alt+f1 see if that gives you a command line
[07:23] <frying_fish> see if its just a graphics issue then.
[07:23] <knithx> frying_fish: no command line
[07:23] <trurl> Henke: the paste the tail of the error "file"
[07:23] <jonah1980> hi guys i remember reading something in last linux format about a new audio editor being worked on which was supposed to beat audacity but i can't remember what it was? does anyone know?

[07:24] <jrib> jonah1980: jokosher?
[07:24] <frying_fish> knithx: reboot and chose the safe graphics option
[07:24] <Slart> knithx: then try the safe mode thingy...you can add options to the boot command to disable acpi and whatever.. play around.. see if anything works..
[07:24] <jonah1980> jrib, maybe - could be...

[07:26] <frying_fish> knithx: no it won't, but you can get that after install, and fix it better then.
[07:27] <knithx> frying_fish: Without fglrx? I don't want that, because I want beryl
[07:27] <Slart> rukuartic: oh.. didn't think about that.. ifconfig then?
[07:27] <jonah1980> jrib, do you think it will be better than audacity and is it gnome orientated?
[07:27] <rukuartic> Slart: I tried... I could connect to the network, but not to the internet.
[07:27] <jrib> jonah1980: i never tried it but yes I think it is gnome oriented

[07:30] <SilentDis> slart:  LOL IPAC, IP over Avian Carrier ;)  I remember reading that RFC a long long time ago *giggle*
[07:30] <poningru> lech: yarr
[07:30] <Slart> SilentDis: hehe.. yes.. one of the more famous rfc
[07:30] <poningru> whatup?
[07:31] <SilentDis> slart:  no, it's dialup, on some of the nations crappiest phone lines.  i'm in range for DSL, but verizon hasn't run a data trunk to my CO yet... no idea when they will... the town i live near has all of 500 people in it, most of 'em are farmers that are lucky if they've got the stereo speakers on the proper sides :P
[07:31] <lech> curious about which default display besides x.org drivers come standard for nvidia based cards on the cd
[07:31] <Slart> SilentDis: ouch... I remember being on dialup... those were definately *NOT* the days
[07:31] <poningru> hmm
[07:31] <lech> or rather what my options will be initially for dual displays
[07:32] <SilentDis> slart:  before you suggest cable:  not out here.  before you suggest satellite:  the $700 install cost and 3000ms latency scared me away.  i'm stuck :P
[07:32] <philo23> what image formats are supported in ubuntu, ether by addon or default: eg, iso, uif, img
[07:32] <rukuartic> Haha Slart, /etc/network/interfaces needs to have "auto eth0" at the start. Google first, ask questions later.
[07:32] <oscar_1101> quick question: how do i find my "~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts" folder to put things into it?
[07:32] <poningru> lech: well for nvidia you have twinview and xinerama but iirc neither are on the cd
[07:32] <poningru> you would have to apt-get them

[07:34] <oscar_1101> cheers silentdis, thats all i wanted, cy'all later
[07:34] <SilentDis> philo23:  both are directly supported.  if you wanna just look at 'em, just sudo mount something.iso /somewhere -t <disk type> -o loop
[07:34] <bluefox83> lol
[07:34] <rukuartic> we2by: if you find it lemme know :3
[07:34] <we2by> :P
[07:34] <jbroome> too slow!
[07:34] <drope> Wolfenstein Enemy Territory ;)
[07:34] <rukuartic> we2by: not entirely.
[07:35] <marco_> I'm using ubuntu 6.10, ati radeon 9550. How can I be sure 3d rendering is active?
[07:35] <bluefox83> well we can certainly tell who the gamers are in here >.>
[07:35] <we2by> rukuartic, css works on ubuntu but sucks
[07:35] <Slart> rukuartic: I'm beginning to lose faith in google since I started using ubuntu.. there are a lot of useless web-sites out there.. =)
[07:35] <M3G4crux> hi to all
[07:35] <rukuartic> Slart: Well I went to ubuntu forums actually >3
[07:35] <we2by> I can't use AWP
[07:35] <philo23> SilentDis: awesome, thanks
[07:35] <rukuartic> Hey M3G4crux
[07:35] <SilentDis> oscar_1101:  nt :)
[07:35] <drope> we2by Wolfestein Enemy Territory
[07:35] <rukuartic> drope: On Linxu?
[07:35] <we2by> drope, free?
[07:35] <bluefox83> wolf ET rawks >.>
[07:35] <lech> poningru: k good deal, bookmarked and will save for reading upon playing, does this also act as a live cd or is it simply an install cd?
=== dyz is now known as Kazero
[07:35] <rpedro> the Ubuntu Edgy dvd has more packages than the desktop cd ??
[07:35] <Slart> rukuartic: hehe.. well, those are ok, most of the time =)
[07:36] <philo23> SilentDis: you dont know if UIf is supported do you?
[07:36] <trurl> Henke: okay, you need to find out why php isnt loaded. check you logfiles for some errors
[07:36] <bluefox83> rukuartic, yep, runs on linux jus spiffeh :D
[07:36] <rukuartic> rpedro: More space :3
[07:36] <drope> rukuartic, we2by yes free and supported natively on linux
[07:36] <rukuartic> bluefox83: WHERE DOWNLOAD? WANNNNT.
[07:36] <SilentDis> philo23:  nt :)
[07:36] <Slart> enemy territory is great... I get some graphics corruption with the latest nvidia drivers though
[07:36] <trurl> Henke: i'm afk for a while, send me a private message
[07:36] <drope> Quake III too
[07:36] <rukuartic> drope: Where?
[07:36] <drope> Doome III too
[07:36] <SilentDis> repedro:  yes.
[07:36] <bluefox83> rukuartic, google for wolfenstein enemy territory, it'llcome up
[07:36] <we2by> drope, mind to tell what's their official website?
[07:36] <rpedro> rukuartic: yes but why the dvd? doesn't the desktop cd also allow to install?
[07:36] <bluefox83> and quake and doom games also work in linux natively >.>
[07:36] <Slart> wolfenstein is free.. as in beer... just make sure you get the 2.60 version
[07:37] <SilentDis> philo23:  I assume you mean UDF for cd/dvds?
[07:37] <philo23> yes
[07:37] <drope> http://games.activision.com/games/wolfenstein/
[07:37] <bluefox83> rpedro, dvd can hold more stuff for installation than cd can
[07:37] <Slart> I even read something about a ubuntu live cd with enemy territory on
[07:37] <rpedro> bluefox83: so, it does have more packages?
[07:37] <marco_> can someone indicate me a site where I can find a way to optimize ati driver for ubuntu 6.10?
[07:37] <SilentDis> Unreal Tournament 2004 has an installer right on the GOTY DVD for linux as well :)
[07:37] <eichi> hi, how much harddisc do you need for a ubuntu standard installation?
[07:37] <we2by> drope, can't see the linux version there
[07:38] <Slart> eichi: 2-10 Gb.. or so
[07:38] <Samus_Aran> since upgrading to Ubuntu 6.10 from 6.06, my /etc/security/limits.conf is no longer being recognized.  how can I track down why it is being ignored ?  for example I set the max open files in there to 6000, but ulimit -n now shows it at 1024, and it can't be increased by my user
[07:38] <drope> http://ftp.games.skynet.be/pub/wolfenstein/et-linux-2.60.x86.run
[07:38] <SilentDis> eichi:  minimum is something like 2gb.. but I can't see a usable system with less than 10gb
[07:38] <Samus_Aran> is PAM's limits.conf no longer used, or what's going on ?
[07:38] <we2by> mhh, P refer ETF over it
[07:38] <Beta_M> so can somebody help me please: i have a folder with ownership of nobody:nogroup, when i go "sudo chown -R myname:mygroup folder" it doesn't change
[07:38] <Samus_Aran> it isn't manually being overridden in /etc/profile, and I don't know where else to look
[07:39] <rpedro> bluefox83: because I can't even find the files to make a jigdo download of the alternate cd anymore...
[07:39] <Kazero> Sweet, I got beryl working
[07:39] <Samus_Aran> Beta_M: check the mount permissions
[07:39] <graham_100> anybody in here have trouble with wine not running??
[07:39] <rukuartic> graham_100: How do you mean?
[07:39] <SilentDis> brb, i need a glass of water and another pack of ciggies lol
[07:39] <Beta_M> Sakarias:  i'm using sudo though
[07:39] <Slart> graham_100: on some software, yes... but it runs other things
[07:39] <Beta_M> and i'm writing to that drive
[07:39] <HuibertGill> Kazero: congrats....
[07:39] <Beta_M> but to other directories
[07:39] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: are you using the Ubuntu packages, or repository from the WINE site ?
[07:40] <drope> we2by, you have anothers mirrors on the official site
[07:40] <graham_100> when i try to run wine it says  : libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4a
[07:40] <Kazero> HuibertGill: Well you wanted to know when I got it working
[07:40] <rukuartic> graham_100: I get that too :P
[07:40] <Kazero> Lets say that I wanted to bind ~ to open terminal. How would I go about doing that?
[07:40] <graham_100> can you fix it and does it ever work??
[07:40] <we2by> drope, I have played that game before.
[07:41] <Samus_Aran> Kazero: that would depend on which desktop environment you are using
[07:41] <we2by> I like ETF more
[07:41] <HuibertGill> Kazero: yeah, are you running beryl with the open source ati driver?
[07:41] <SilentDis> !wine | grahm_100
[07:41] <ubotu> grahm_100: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[07:41] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: I have no issues with WINE, myself.  I use the packages from the WINE repository
[07:41] <Kazero> HuibertGill: No, one I found on the net I think
[07:42] <Samus_Aran> I found the official Ubuntu ones way too out-of-date
[07:42] <HuibertGill> Kazero: on the net, but is it the fglrx thingy?
[07:42] <graham_100> samus_aran i am using wine site reposotories
[07:42] <eyalw> yo
[07:42] <Kazero> HuibertGill: Nope
[07:42] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: and what video card and driver version ?
[07:42] <elementz> got an error while booting -> safe mode gives me 'waiting for root file system' anybody here got a clue what that might mean?
[07:43] <graham_100> I have no video card it's all on board4
[07:43] <Raven> Please can you tell me if it is possible to install KDE without it changing to Kubuntu, as I would like the option of either, or can this cause prob.?
[07:43] <Samus_Aran> SilentDis: hey, no making jokes at someone with a built-in missile launcher
[07:43] <Samus_Aran> Raven: that works fine.  just install it
[07:43] <SilentDis> Samus_Aran:  ohhh, good point.  rofl
[07:43] <Samus_Aran> Raven: I have Gnome and KDE installed, and use neither
[07:44] <HuibertGill> Raven: just don't install the kubuntu meta package
[07:44] <SilentDis> Raven:  if you install kubuntu-desktop, you'll have choices on login (under sessions) to switch back and forth
[07:44] <eyalw> Anyone knows QEMO?
[07:44] <Samus_Aran> Raven: as a strange coincidence, my real life first name is Raven =)
[07:44] <Raven> whats the best way to install it then Huibergill
[07:44] <HuibertGill> eyalw: you mean QEMU?
[07:44] <Samus_Aran> Raven: install KDE, not Kubuntu
[07:44] <HuibertGill> Raven: install what you need?
[07:44] <eyalw> HuibertGill: QEMU, right... I wanna load my xp from my hda1
[07:45] <graham_100> silentdis i can run winecfg and notepad but it just won't work whatever i do
[07:45] <SilentDis> !qemu | eyalw
[07:45] <ubotu> eyalw: qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
[07:45] <Samus_Aran> Raven: if you install some app you need, it will install any dependancies.  e.g. if you wanted to use the CD burning app k3b, just: sudo apt-get install k3b
[07:45] <Raven> anybody know the commands without it changing to Kubuntu
[07:45] <Samus_Aran> Raven: or use Synaptic
[07:45] <HuibertGill> eyalw: I don't know if this would be possible, does it work for you?
[07:45] <SilentDis> eyalw:  from what I understand, that's not possible with QEMU, it has to be on a virtual file system.
[07:45] <graham_100> samus_aran have you any ideas on what i can do to this wine to get it to work
[07:45] <HuibertGill> Raven: Samus_Aran is correct, install what you need...
[07:46] <SilentDis> graham_100:  what app are you trying to run?
[07:46] <eyalw> HuibertGill: i'm not sure... ad I understend, it creates a partition and run the install and just then it lets u load the system...
[07:46] <Raven> thanks peeps
[07:46] <graham_100> theme hospital
[07:46] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: even if it is on-board, it is still a PCI or AGP video card.  what's the model, and which driver are you using with Xorg ?
[07:46] <graham_100> and black and white
[07:46] <eyalw> SilentDis: I guess... so are there any alternatives?
[07:46] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: if you don't know the chipset of your graphics card, check: lspci|grep -i vga
[07:47] <HuibertGill> eyalw: yes, that's why it will presumably not work with the allready installed win xp on hda1
[07:47] <graham_100> 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  630/730 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter (rev 31)
[07:47] <SilentDis> graham_100:  lots of games don't quite work right without a DirectX wrapper.  Personally, i use Cedega
[07:47] <SilentDis> !cedega | graham_100
[07:47] <ubotu> graham_100: cedega is a project based on WINE, aimed at running Windows games on Linux. For more info, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cedega
[07:47] <HuibertGill> eyalw: I think it was/is a feature for vmware (raw disk access)
[07:48] <graham_100> silentdis i dont have cedega
[07:48] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: are you trying to run 3D games, or just 2D desktop stuff ?
[07:48] <SilentDis> eyalw:  only one that I know of that can do that is a pay-for virtual pc program
[07:48] <HuibertGill> eyalw: but it would be difficult because if the emulated hardware being different from your real hardware
[07:48] <Raven> Can I install KDE from the terminal
[07:48] <graham_100> samus_aron both
[07:48] <Samus_Aran> Raven: I already gave you an example command
[07:49] <mince> what's the proper spelling of dpkg --force-conflicts? I can't make it working...
[07:49] <Raven> soory m8, must have missed it
[07:49] <eyalw> HuibertGill: mmm... I just wanna load my xp from my second partition, is that qualified as another hardware?
[07:49] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: as far as I know (last time I checked), there is no 3D accelleration on SiS cards, just 2D accelleration.
[07:49] <HuibertGill> eyalw: yes
[07:49] <graham_100> oh i see
[07:49] <SilentDis> graham_100:  if you're looking to play windows games under linux, it works, and works VERY well.  might wanna look into it :)
[07:50] <HuibertGill> eyalw: win xp will see another hardware enviroment running in qemu/vmware a srunning stand alone
[07:50] <SilentDis> graham_100:  I play all the GTA games, as well as Star Wars Galaxies under linux using Cedega :)
[07:50] <ubun> is there a gui ssh client with ubuntu by default?
[07:50] <graham_100> silentdis how do i get cedega
[07:50] <jerp> raven, sure anything can be entered with sudo apt-get install <blah-blah blah-blah blah-blam blamo kablewie>
[07:50] <Tmob> my known_host has the machine name also encrypted .. so i can't remove a particular machine from it
[07:50] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: glxinfo|grep direct
[07:50] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: run that and paste the line
[07:50] <Tmob> anyone know how to find the entry related to a specific machine?
[07:50] <eyalw> HuibertGill: wow, thats amazing to me... so the comunity never addressed this issue... isn't this a very common one?
[07:51] <Samus_Aran> ubun: not sure, but you can install PuTTY, it has a full GUI
[07:51] <HuibertGill> eyalw: what "issue" do you mean?
[07:51] <ubun> a cool i thought putty was win32 only
[07:51] <SilentDis> graham_100:  think of it this way, it's an extra $15 well invested, and you can just cancel your sub after 3 months if you're not interested in it.  not a big loss :)
[07:51] <SilentDis> graham_100:  the link from ubotu is your best bet
[07:51] <Kazero> So any work on how I could bind ~ to open console?
[07:51] <rellis> In Ubuntu 6.06 Server... is there a cleaner way set an interface no autoneg, 100 full duplex other than adding a post-up command in /etc/network/interfaces?
[07:51] <kitche> graham_100: if you read what ubotu said it tells you where to get cedega since you have to pay for it or use the cvs(which is not very good)
[07:51] <eyalw> HuibertGill: loading XP from another part.
[07:51] <SilentDis> !cedega | graham_100
[07:51] <ubotu> graham_100: cedega is a project based on WINE, aimed at running Windows games on Linux. For more info, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cedega
[07:51] <kwood> Could anyone tell me... does it really matter if I have 6.10 server or 6.10 desktop to things such as found here http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10  i am mainly looking to learn the function s of a server etc.. but still have the graphical backup....
[07:51] <HuibertGill> Kazero: look in the beryl setingsmanager, there is an command execute thingy
[07:51] <trurl> ubun: ssh with gui? why?
[07:52] <graham_100> i don't like the idea of paying for things in $ i am in the uk
[07:52] <Kazero> !cedega | Kazero
[07:52] <ubotu> Kazero: cedega is a project based on WINE, aimed at running Windows games on Linux. For more info, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cedega
[07:52] <ubun> cause i'm used to putty
[07:52] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: you should stop trying to install Cedega and first see if your graphics card is capable of doing OpenGL under Xorg.  if it isn't, you can't play any 3D games no matter what you do ...
[07:52] <Kazero> HuibertGill: I was hoping there was one built into Ubuntu itself
[07:53] <HuibertGill> eyalw: it's not the loading, it's trying to convince windows to run on two differntly layouted machine sfrom the same installed OS, knoppix/ubuntu etal. would do this without a hitch
[07:53] <SilentDis> graham_100:  $15 is...  mm... 7GBP or so?
[07:53] <graham_100> well in xp my on board graphics worked ok
[07:53] <graham_100> all 3d games did work
[07:53] <trurl> ubun: all you need to know is (except if you want to use x-forwarding or logging): 'ssh -l USERNAME -p PORT HOST' ... thats all... ;)
[07:53] <SilentDis> graham_100:  do read what Samus_Aran said.  that's a HUGE first step.  it's all moot until you have 3d accel working under linux.
[07:54] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: whether they worked in XP or not has no bearing on them working in Xorg
[07:54] <marco_> whats better? ubuntu or kubuntu?
[07:54] <HuibertGill> Kazero: look into system->settings->key shortcuts (I think, may lang is DE), it might work in beryl too
[07:54] <drope> marco_, troll
[07:54] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: run the command I gave you above, that will list if you have accelleration or not
[07:54] <marco_> :) tanks
[07:54] <ubun> marco trollo?
[07:54] <eyalw> ho man...
[07:54] <aiduciukas> Hi! How I can change chanel frequency in tvtime?
[07:54] <kitche> !better|marco_
[07:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about better - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:54] <graham_100> libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4a
[07:54] <graham_100> direct rendering: Yes
[07:55] <trurl> !stfu
[07:55] <ubotu> Words like noob, jfgi, stfu or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
[07:55] <kitche> marco_: they are pretty much the same thing just that one uses kde and the otehr uses gnome
[07:55] <Samus_Aran> marco_: Kubuntu is better if you want KDE preinstalled as the default desktop.  Ubuntu is better if you want Gnome installed as the default desktop.  XUbuntu is better if you want neither installed by default ...
[07:55] <eyalw> so, the only way is to move hda1 into the linux fs?
[07:55] <trurl> ahh,.... thanks ;)
[07:55] <SilentDis> macro_:  that's a personal choice and needs question.  it's impossible to recommend one over the other until your needs, experience, and what you intend to do inside the GUI are known :)
[07:55] <kwood> Could anyone tell me... does it really matter if I have 6.10 server or 6.10 desktop to things such as found here http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10 i am mainly looking to learn the function s of a server etc.. but still have the graphical backup....
[07:55] <Samus_Aran> what the heck is jfgi ?
[07:55] <graham_100> samus_aron what does that mean???    libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4a
[07:55] <graham_100> direct rendering: Yes
[07:55] <HuibertGill> eyalw: what are you traing to "move", do you want to access files on ypur win xp partition?
[07:55] <trurl> Samus_Aran: dunno ;)
[07:56] <aiduciukas> Hi! How I can change chanel frequency in tvtime?
[07:56] <Samus_Aran> trurl: never seen that one before, heh
[07:56] <HuibertGill> eyalw: you need no qemu/vmware for that
[07:56] <mjr> graham_100, the warning is of no consequence; you should have acceleration
[07:56] <marco_> how can i see what video driver i have installed
[07:56] <eyalw> HuibertGill:  no, i know how yo mount fs's. i wanna launch WinXP
[07:56] <HuibertGill> !ntfs
[07:56] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[07:56] <kitche> Samus_Aran: same thing as just google it
[07:56] <SilentDis> Samus_Aran:  I haven't a clue either lol
[07:57] <HuibertGill> eyalw: why? :-)
[07:57] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: xdpyinfo |grep extensions
[07:57] <bluefox83> marco_, lsmod
[07:57] <marco_> tanks
[07:57] <bluefox83> mhmm
[07:57] <Samus_Aran> kitche: ah, thanks.
[07:57] <jojoman02> i can't record sound, the applicaiton just freezes
[07:57] <SilentDis> eyalw:  if you want to do that with qemu, you'll need to install WinXP to a virtual drive within QEMU.  it can't launch it from a /dev/hdxx mount point.
[07:57] <Samus_Aran> jojoman02: which application, what soundcard ?
[07:58] <eyalw> HuibertGill: hmm... because! :) no, its because i sometimes need my apps that work on xp alone , school stuff... and i hate booting
[07:58] <Samus_Aran> SilentDis: device, not mount point
[07:58] <graham_100> samus_aran:   number of extensions:    30
[07:58] <eyalw> SilentDis: why is that?
[07:58] <jojoman02> sound recorder applications (default one) and Via 8237 (from alsamixer)
[07:58] <marco_> what does it mean drm = radeon?
[07:59] <HuibertGill> eyalw: if you want to go the vmware way, you should at least create a second hardware profile in xp before you start experimenting, ...
[07:59] <SilentDis> eyalw:  if you want to launch it from the install on your drive, you'll need to get something like VMWare, and pay for it.
[07:59] <HuibertGill> eyalw: and be prepared to  reinstall :-)
[07:59] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: okay, so by the looks of it you have reasonable 3D support available
[07:59] <graham_100> samus_aran what does that tell me???
[07:59] <SilentDis> samus_aran:  thank you, yes, device.  i've been pounding on edgy to get it to work for far too long rofl
[07:59] <kitche> SilentDis: I think the server edition can do what he wants alos which if free as in free beer
[07:59] <graham_100> samus_aran so i guess wine should work *like it used to*
[07:59] <jojoman02> Samus_Aran: sound recorder applications (default one) and Via 8237 (from alsamixer)
[08:00] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: now what exactly have you done to your WINE install ?
[08:00] <trurl> Samus_Aran: Ha! 'Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis' ... or....
[08:00] <SilentDis> eyalw:  because QEMU doesn't support going from a device
[08:00] <eyalw> so, there is no possible way to *move the hda1 fs into the /tmp for qemu to be able to load it u say?
[08:00] <trurl> Samus_Aran: 'Just F***** Google It'
[08:00] <kitche> eyalw: look up vmware server it might be able to do what you want which doesnt cost anything
[08:00] <Samus_Aran> graham_100: you always have to start at the lowest level and work up.  if you have no OpenGL, there's no point in trying to get WINE to use OpenGL.  since WINE stopped working, do any other apps have working GL ?
[08:01] <SilentDis> eyalw:  HuibertGill makes a GREAT point, booting that winxp partition... it'll see 'new hardware', ie the virtual machine, not the actual machine.  it'll end up reconfiguring itself a lot, and if it works, it'll never boot on the actual machine properly again, most likely
[08:01] <Samus_Aran> trurl: thanks, though kitche filled me in above
[08:01] <HuibertGill> eyalw: you could try to copy all files from xp into the new virtual qemu hd and boot, but I doubt it would work, because of the hardware layout differences....
[08:02] <Noiano> hello everybody
[08:02] <Noiano> i need an urgent help
[08:02] <trurl> Hi
[08:02] <aiduciukas> Hi! How I can change chanel frequency in tvtime?
[08:02] <syd67ro> hello. I see that kubuntu 6.10 dvd has 3.93 GB. I'm used to the install CDs, which barely have 600MBs. what contents does the dvd have?
[08:02] <trurl> Noiano: just ask
[08:02] <eyalw> HuibertGill: haa.... too addvanced stuff for a week only in ubuntu guy
[08:02] <Samus_Aran> SilentDis, HuibertGill: that is a good point on older operating systems like Windows 9x, however XP and 2000 are fairly good at updating hardware at boot time (usually only takes one reboot to have the new hardware work), whereas 9x would often take a ton of reboots and several trips to safe mode to recover from changing hardware
[08:02] <aiduciukas> more programs and other stuff
[08:02] <HuibertGill> eyalw: qemu being gpl, you are free to write an raw disk extension yourself :-)
[08:02] <SilentDis> welcome to the insanity that is #ubuntu, Noiano
[08:02] <aiduciukas> syd67ro,  more programs and other stuff
[08:02] <k-osh> Suddenly my machine stopped booting. It's an lvm-on-raid machine. When mounted and chrooted from a live-cd it sais something like "Incompatible libdevmapper" and "Is device-mapper missing from kernel" when doing a lilo -t. Anyone who can help me with this?
[08:03] <SilentDis> !ask | Noiano
[08:03] <ubotu> Noiano: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:03] <Noiano> i have copied some fiiles from my local hard drive to an usb driver using kde
[08:03] <Samus_Aran> SilentDis, HuibertGill: additionally, you can set up hardware profiles, one for VMware or QEmu, one for real hardware, and then choose it at boot time
[08:03] <Noiano> but kde hasn't copied any files because the device hasn't written anything
[08:03] <aiduciukas> Hi! How I can change chanel frequency in tvtime?
[08:03] <Noiano> maybe everything is in cache
=== phpError is now known as reZo
[08:04] <HuibertGill> eyalw: Samus_Aran yes, I tried that once (2002, long time ago) but it did not work all that well (at the windows side of things)
[08:04] <Noiano> how can i force the writing?
[08:04] <Samus_Aran> eyalw: I recommend using a boot CD image to boot QEmu, then format your virtual disk with that and mirror (copy over) your /dev/hd-whatever that has your files on it, to the QEmu virtual drive
[08:04] <k-osh> Noiano: Unmount it.
[08:04] <Samus_Aran> eyalw: this is assuming you have hard drive space to copy it
[08:04] <Noiano> i cannot: device busy
[08:04] <kitche> Noiano: you might have to sync it
[08:04] <Noiano> how?
[08:04] <marco_> what program should I use to extract rar?
[08:04] <ubun> how do you maximize windows from the keyboard?
[08:04] <jdier> does anyone know how to get the old fashioned cents ($0.01) symbol to appear?
[08:05] <trurl> Noiano: 'sudo sync', but i doubt thats the problem
[08:05] <k-osh> marco_: unrar
[08:05] <eyalw> well, thank you alot anyway... thats too addvanced for me at the moment
[08:05] <SilentDis> samus_aran:  hmm..  you know, never thought of that.  still, the sticking point for qemu is that it won't boot a device.
[08:05] <marco_> tanks
[08:05] <Noiano> I have tried but nothing is writetn
[08:05] <eyalw> bye for now
[08:05] <kitche> Noiano: but how did copy the files to the usb device?
[08:05] <Samus_Aran> Noiano: Linux will cache writes to slow media like zip disks and such, if you want to tell the kernel to write out all cached data to disk, use "sudo sync" from the console
[08:05] <Noiano> using kde and konqueror
[08:05] <kazim59> I am going to install Dapper Drake from DVD... is it possible to upgrade dapper drake to edgy after installation?
[08:05] <ubun> yes
[08:05] <Noiano> nothing happend with sudo sync
[08:05] <trurl> Noiano: try to use the shell to copy files an check if it happend first
[08:06] <SilentDis> !rar | marco_
[08:06] <ubotu> marco_: rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[08:06] <Samus_Aran> SilentDis: which is why I recommended creating a virtual disk and use a Linux boot CD image to copy the contents of the Windows to the virtual one
[08:06] <Noiano> what about the files I have "copied" by kde?
[08:06] <trurl> Nikolas: when sync gives no output, everything is fine ;)
[08:06] <kitche> Noiano: ok well if you didn't mount the device so your user can write to it then you will have to do gksu or sudo
[08:06] <kazim59> I am going to install Dapper Drake from DVD... is it possible to upgrade dapper drake to edgy after installation?
[08:06] <SilentDis> eyalw:  i would read up on qemu and it's abilities...
[08:06] <SilentDis> !qemu | eyalw
[08:06] <ubotu> eyalw: qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
[08:06] <jonah1980> is there a tool so kde progs look like gnome in ubuntu? audacity looks awful, writing real big etc
[08:06] <jonah1980> doesn't match
[08:06] <Noiano> kitche i have done an chown
[08:07] <Noiano> so i coudl write!
[08:07] <kitche> kazim59: yes if you do update-manager -c
[08:07] <kitche> Noiano: a chown won't work
[08:07] <Samus_Aran> SilentDis: you should even be able to raw write the device to the virtual drive once booted into it (cat /dev/hda1 > /dev/whatever/the/virtual/one/is)
[08:07] <soundray> jonah1980: audacity isn't kde
[08:07] <SilentDis> !upgrade | kazim59
[08:07] <ubotu> kazim59: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[08:07] <Noiano> how do I manage now?
[08:07] <kazim59> kitche: and do u have an idea how much more memory shall it download to become edgy?
[08:07] <khermans> how can i check what options my current kernel was built with?
[08:07] <kitche> kazim59: no clue but it's probably over 100 megs
[08:07] <soundray> khermans: less /boot/config-$(uname -r)
[08:08] <HuibertGill> Noiano: Samus_Aran would't dd be better for that?
[08:08] <Noiano> what?
[08:08] <SilentDis> samus_aran: hmm...  i'll have to look into that myself once I get edgy all setup :)
[08:08] <Samus_Aran> jonah1980: select the GTK+ theme that you like, you can manually override the font size settings with gtk-theme-switch and gtk-theme-switch2 (switch and switch2 apps), or by manually editing your ~/.gtkrc or ~/.gtkrc-2.0 files
[08:08] <HuibertGill> Noiano: sorry, wrong guy
[08:08] <khermans> soundray, thx :-)
[08:08] <soundray> jonah1980: audacity is built with libgtk2
[08:09] <Noiano> kitche:  help
[08:09] <kitche> Noiano: try the sudo cp <files> <mount point> and see if it works that way
[08:09] <Samus_Aran> HuibertGill: dd does have optional error recovery, which cat doesn't have.  modern hard drives tend not to have problems, though.  in the olden days setting the sector read size could make a huge speed difference, but modern hard drives cache a substantial amount of read-ahead, so there's no noticeable speed increase
[08:09] <SilentDis> kazim59:  i think you have memory (RAM, temporary storage) confused with hard drive space (storage)
[08:09] <Noiano> ok
[08:10] <soundray> oh you got it, thanks Samus_Aran
[08:10] <murali> hi all
[08:10] <trurl> Noiano: open a shell, 'touch ~\trash.file' return 'cp ~\trash.file \PATHTOYOURUSBSTICK' and paste the output
[08:10] <blekos> hi, there is an option in kde windows, instead of being minimized to close and see the title of the window
[08:10] <blekos> is there anything similar in gnome?
[08:10] <murali> i'm stuck wih a very wierd problem with ubuntu
[08:10] <Samus_Aran> soundray: I got what ?  I hope not a terminal disease
[08:11] <murali> i'd be glad i someone could help me out with it
[08:11] <SilentDis> blekos:  i assume you mean 'rollup', as in just the titlebar is visible?
[08:11] <Noiano> trurl i have send this command touch ~\trash.file' return 'cp ~\trash.file\sdc1
[08:11] <Noiano> is that correct?
[08:11] <soundray> blekos: you can configure "Roll-Up" on title doubleclick via System-Prefs-Window...
[08:11] <trurl> no no...
[08:11] <blekos> yes, didnt know the exact world,
[08:11] <marco_> what program should I use to opne chm files
[08:11] <soundray> Samus_Aran: gtk2 and audacity. Sry, bit slow today.
[08:11] <kitche> !permissions|Noiano you want the volume permission page
[08:11] <ubotu> Noiano you want the volume permission page: The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[08:11] <trurl> return means press return ;)
[08:11] <kazim59> SilentDis: i mean when upgrading... it will download packages.... how much MB will it get?
[08:11] <Samus_Aran> marco_: there are three main ones I know about.  I found kchmviewer has the least rendering bugs, so I would try that first if you have KDE libs available
[08:12] <SilentDis> murali:  ask away, what's the problem?
[08:12] <jonah1980> so what to i use to set the gtk theme to start with, is there a program to do this easily?
[08:12] <trurl> Noiano: an leave the 's out
[08:12] <marco_> tanks.
[08:12] <blekos> great, thnx soundray
[08:12] <SilentDis> kazim59:  somewhere around 150mb for the download, i believe... I think it's listed on the upgrade help page
[08:12] <soundray> Noiano: and use forward slashes
[08:12] <Samus_Aran> marco_: past that, there are gnochm and xchm
[08:13] <rpc> guys... i totally don't understand CVS and the way i should use it to upgrade a piece of software, can someone please point me to a good guide?
[08:13] <michalus_> hello
[08:13] <Samus_Aran> marco_: all of them are in the default repositories, so just: sudo apt-get install <name>, or use Synaptic GUI
=== _DreamThief is now known as DreamThief
[08:13] <kazim59> SilentDis: thanx... previously i used the ubuntu 6.06 CD and it had many packages missing
[08:13] <soundray> !cvs | rpc
[08:13] <ubotu> rpc: cvs is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source network-transparent version control system; it helps to manage releases and to control concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. See: https://www.cvshome.org/

[08:14] <soundray> michalus_: identity crisis? ;)
[08:14] <bledy> Hi Peole :)
[08:14] <michalus_> soundray, i'm looking for someone with working wi-fi
[08:14] <winex> i want to enter a channel with spanish support
[08:14] <SilentDis> kazim59:  i'm stuck on dialup myself... I ordered the ubuntu and kubuntu 6.10 dvds from amazon.  just finishing my initial setups now :)
[08:14] <bledy> Hi people :)
[08:14] <Samus_Aran> marco_: (I was studying for a certification), and the kchmviewer definitely was the best of the three of them.  the other two had errors on the pages, for example not indenting when they should, or missing italics (that one was pretty bad)
[08:14] <kitche> !es | winex
[08:14] <ubotu> winex: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[08:15] <soundray> michalus_: your question is not a good way to get help.

[08:15] <ubotu> michalus_: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[08:15] <michalus_> soundray, yes but it's specific problem, i think it depends on the hardware and brad siemens fujitsu
[08:15] <bledy> I would ask: How can I print with lexmark 2300 series ehen i don't have the driver?
[08:15] <michalus_> ubotu, thanks, i looked wiki and forum
[08:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks, i looked wiki and forum - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:16] <SilentDis> kitche:  you beat me to it rofl
[08:16] <jerp> marco_,  I have the one titled  "ubuntu hacks"

[08:16] <Lynoure> bledy: Have you checked on the linux printing site already?
[08:16] <soundray> michalus_: it never is. Even Fujitsu-Siemens don't build the same wifi chipset in each of their laptops.
[08:16] <Samus_Aran> I need to get back to working on my web site.  good day allveryone
[08:16] <bledy> Lynoure: Where?
[08:16] <Lynoure> bledy: Or asked the manufacturer if they are planning to come up with a driver?
[08:16] <renegade> hello
[08:17] <marco_> I just foun 'Ubuntu unleashed' :)
[08:17] <bledy> Lynoure: No.
[08:17] <bledy> Lynoure: How can i do that?

[08:17] <michalus_> soundray, chipset s ipw3945, so it could be working out of the box
[08:17] <michalus_> soundray, but it's not working, i can't set rf_kill to 0 ;] 
[08:18] <bledy> Lynoure: I'll see now, thanks.
[08:18] <Lynoure> bledy: The latter you can probably do from the Lexmark site. Some manufacturers do not offer specs or drivers, but it still helps to ask.
[08:18] <soundray> michalus_: what's rf_kill?
[08:18] <blekos> what is the command line for uninstall?
[08:18] <HYPOCRISY> confidential
[08:18] <michalus_> soundray, rf_kill is parameter in ipw3945 driver
[08:18] <michalus_> see http://fsam7440.sourceforge.net/index2.html
[08:18] <bledy> Lynoure: Ok, ill visit the lex mark now.
[08:18] <BlueStorm> does ubuntu 6.10 work well with ipw3945 ?
[08:19] <soundray> blekos: 'sudo apt-get --purge remove packagename' (--purge removes config files along with everything else)
[08:19] <michalus_> it's like switch, which is off
[08:19] <soundray> blekos: check out 'man apt-get'
[08:19] <blekos> ok thnx
[08:19] <michalus_> soundray, if the information on this www is true, ipw3945 on the siemens fujitsu is special ;]  so i'm looking for someone with SF

[08:22] <[zebra] > hello ReiserFS or XFS or JFS ?
[08:22] <soundray> atlef: interesting one ;)
[08:23] <michalus_> soundray, there are no information about Siemens Fujitsu, i have been lookig on the Internet, forum and ubuntu wiki and nothing
[08:23] <logic__> hi
[08:23] <logic__> are the ubuntu sources down or something?
[08:23] <SilentDis> take care all.  got some errands to run :)
[08:23] <soundray> michalus_: what's your model name again?
[08:23] <kitche> [zebra] : is this for a server? since XFS and JS are meant more for servers or if you have large files
[08:23] <php-freak>  wget ftp://user:pass@8447@207.210.232.153/public_html/ hey guys when I use this command wget for some reason its downloading the directory listing to a index.htm file, and show the files listed, but don't download the files from that folder?
[08:23] <logic__> when i do "apt-get update" i get "waiting for headers" forever
[08:23] <michalus_> soundray, Siemens Fujitsu V3505
[08:23] <marco_> I just installed kchmviewer but the document still the same, inrecognizable
[08:24] <[zebra] > kitche: no for pc

[08:24] <michalus_> soundray, ;)
[08:24] <Kazero> Ok, so I use beryl to change the windows look, but how would I change the look of the gnome bar? Im on www.gnome-look.org
[08:24] <marco_> maybe if I try gchm ?
[08:24] <michalus_> soundray, okey, but there are not FS laptops on your www
[08:24] <Lynoure> logic__: Some of the repositories in your sources list might be temperarily inaccessable, or permanently gone
[08:24] <kitche> [zebra] : then reiser would be good unless you will have over a lot of 4 gig files
[08:25] <jerp> kazero, the gnome panel bar is wacked

[08:32] <nikin> soundray :D
[08:32] <nikin> but what can man do with 2,8 TB at home?
[08:32] <computrius> hello
[08:33] <kitche> gop: the server does but not programs that are used to do what you want

[08:33] <computrius> anyone know if there is some reason I cant remove gcj without removing everything up to and including "ubuntu-desktop"?
[08:33] <murali> SilentDis,ubotu:: i understand wat u r saying...i knou tht wen u install a new distro ,then u've to manually edit the grub.conf file for the other partitions to be visible on the grub menu...but the prob is not so simple.. i think it has deleted my partitions.. usually wen i boot up thro the knoppix live dvd,on the desktop it shows all the partition on either disks but nou its only showing the 2 partions on hdd and the ubuntu partition on hda1... it is very
[08:33] <marco_> I am sad. I'm new with ubuntu. I'm using edgy. The problem is: I'm trying to unleash all the potencial of my graphics card (ati radeon 9550) but I dont know how. I just folowed several recomendations found by google but none works. There is even one that made me reinstall ubuntu
[08:33] <soundray> atlef: check out the first entries in /var/log/installer/syslog (you need sudo to read the file)
[08:34] <atlef> thx
[08:34] <computrius> is there some way I can tell apt-get to remove gcj, and ignore (not remove) dependencies
[08:34] <kitche> !ati| marco_ might help you not sure if you seen this howto yet
[08:34] <ubotu> marco_ might help you not sure if you seen this howto yet: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:34] <soundray> marco_: the binary driver situation is indeed sad. Please complain to NVidia and ask them to support proper free driver development.
[08:34] <h08817> i wish i could get ubuntu
[08:34] <gelegroda> hmm , what is the command to connect to my pppoe-based ADSL? (in terminal) i have forgot the command..
[08:35] <logic__> does anybody know how to play DIVX-5 files on ubuntu?
[08:35] <marco_> it's ati
[08:35] <computrius> ati has crappy software even in windows
[08:35] <marco_> ati radeon 9550 , ubuntu 6.10
[08:35] <computrius> if they dont care about windows, they certainly wont care about linux
[08:35] <soundray> marco_: oops, sorry, but it's the same: rather than halfheartedly throwing half-working closed drivers to us, ask them to support Xorg driver development.
[08:35] <h08817> why is it that in windows my hd says it is 1.8GB but in the partitioner it only says 1.3GB?
[08:35] <computrius> their remote wonder drivers crash about every 20 minutes
[08:35] <marco_> but I heard of aiglx
[08:35] <soundray> marco_: actually, ATI are worse than NVidia
[08:36] <kitche> h08817: some of the space is reserved
[08:36] <nikin> Ati and Nvidia arent so bad, i have an Intel 855 and i stand no chance to get it working like under windows
[08:36] <h08817> can i unleash it?
[08:36] <computrius> the only reason their video cards perform better is because they have higher clock speeds
[08:36] <atlef> soundray : worked like a charm, i think
[08:36] <computrius> (why does nvidia set their clocks so low?)
[08:37] <soundray> atlef: good to know
[08:37] <nikin> coz their are sucki
[08:37] <nikin> sry
[08:37] <jojoman02> can anyone help me get my sound working?
[08:37] <soundray> computrius: I guess they can sell more higher-end cards that way
[08:37] <marco_> Ok, what you saying is that there is no how of making my card working 100% with ubuntu?
[08:37] <soundray> !sound | jojoman02
[08:37] <ubotu> jojoman02: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[08:37] <computrius> if nvidia combine their higher number of pipelines with higher clock speeds they would kick ass
[08:37] <jojoman02> soundray: thanks
[08:37] <kitche> computrius: anyways ati is more for DirectX while nvidia is OpenGL
[08:38] <computrius> ahh
[08:38] <soundray> jojoman02: check back here if you still have trouble
[08:38] <computrius> im a new nvidia user :)
[08:38] <nikin> computriu: for about 10 second before the VGA cards bursts out in flames
[08:38] <computrius> first time using linux with nvidia as opposed to ati.  I now see what ive been missing :)
[08:38] <marco_> I just wanted it to work 100%. I dont care what's better, nvidia or ati
[08:39] <murali> SILENTDIS,UBOTU:: i understand wat u r saying...i knou tht wen u install a new distro ,then u've to manually edit the grub.conf file for the other partitions to be visible on the grub menu...but the prob is not so simple.. i think it has deleted my partitions.. usually wen i boot up thro the knoppix live dvd,on the desktop it shows all the partition on either disks but nou its only showing the 2 partions on hdd and the ubuntu partition on hda1... it is very
[08:39] <soundray> marco_: actually, I have that same experience: NVidia has a better chance of working 100%
[08:39] <computrius> anyway, is there a way to remove gcj via apt-get without removing the entire system?
[08:39] <nikin> clock speed is about heat, with proper cooling (liquid nitrogen) you can do about 12 Ghz with an intel P4 or so
[08:39] <Zaggynl> how do I use nessus on ubuntu?
[08:39] <computrius> synaptic puts up a list of about every piece of software on the system whether it uses java or not if I try to remove it
[08:39] <marco_> But I have to be sure that the modifications I will make wont corrupt the system
[08:40] <Zaggynl> I just installed it using synaptic, but I cannot login to it
[08:40] <JVolt> Hello
[08:40] <soundray> marco_: do you need 3D acceleration?
[08:40] <marco_> Yes
[08:40] <kitche> computrius: I am not sure if gcj can be removed since ubuntu uses that by default for a lot of things
[08:40] <computrius> I wish they would just use sun java by default
[08:40] <soundray> marco_: too bad, Xorg's nv is not too bad for everything *other* than 3D...
[08:40] <marco_> 3d acceleration: the card is ati radeon 9550
[08:40] <computrius> its open source now isnt it? why dont they?
[08:40] <soundray> marco_: too bad, Xorg's ati is not too bad for everything *other* than 3D...
[08:41] <soundray> marco_: sorry, still getting confused...
[08:41] <kitche> computrius: java isn't open source the implmentation of java is
[08:41] <mjr> kitche, it can be removed, nothing too central depends on it
[08:41] <soundray> kitche: now that's a subtle distinction
[08:41] <JVolt> Do anyone know if theres any repos with in wxwidgets pack
[08:41] <logic__> can you tell me how to install mplayer on ubuntu?
[08:41] <JVolt> for ubuntu?
[08:41] <kitche> soundray: well java isn't there is no classpath's yet that are open source
[08:42] <soundray> logic__: 'sudo apt-get install mplayer'
[08:42] <mjr> computrius, it'll take a while for sun to free all of their java, and some parts depend on non-sun non-free things; it'll get there, but not that quick
[08:42] <ismail> since were in this topic does anyone have a fix for the sis 661 built in vga in the motherboard
[08:42] <soundray> kitche: but Sun has promised to GPL it all, haven't they?
[08:42] <ismail> cant find drivers for debien
[08:43] <JVolt> i has tryed install lmule and amule but both in configure step say: checking for wx-config... no
[08:43] <kitche> soundray: according to what sun said they are only open sourcing the implentation of java
[08:43] <JVolt> so how can i get it? just compiling it?
[08:43] <logic__> soundray: not found, but referenced by another project :(
[08:43] <logic__> i need a way to play div-x 5
[08:43] <soundray> logic__: you have to fix your repos. Spend some time with those ubotu links:
[08:43] <soundray> !software | logic__
[08:43] <ubotu> logic__: A general introduction to the ways software can be installed, removed and managed in Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoftwareManagement - See also !Packages and !Equivalents
[08:43] <marco_> tank you anyway soundray
[08:44] <marco_> What graphics card work better with ubuntu?
[08:45] <marco_> matrox?
[08:45] <computrius> guess im going to be tracking down the scripts that conflict names with suns java and delete them then :)
[08:45] <computrius> was just hoping I didnt have to do it the hard way
[08:45] <soundray> marco_: there really isn't a good alternative. I'm thinking about buying a Mac with integrated Intel graphics.
[08:45] <Plouj> hi
[08:46] <marco_> Is there a solution for this problem in the future ?
[08:46] <soundray> marco_: matrox used to have nicely supported cards (Millennium with the mga driver...)
[08:46] <Plouj> is it possible to cause NetworkManager to store a wifi access key in plain text to remove the requirement of entering the password at each computer bootup?
[08:46] <soundray> marco_: but they don't really offer consumer cards any more.
[08:46] <jove> there is a command, I thought it was gnome-conf, that allows you to set gnome default apps. Anyone know what it is?
[08:46] <kitche> soundray yeah on the openjdk site it says they aren't open sourcing Java the language
[08:46] <matti> a
[08:46] <nikin> can someone suggest a tutorial for reencoding video files using ubuntu?
[08:46] <soundray> Thanks kitche. Makes you wonder why they are only going half the way...
[08:48] <soundray> marco_: I'm still hoping that AMD are going to sort out ATI, now that they've bought them out
[08:48] <erryko> hello everyone

[09:25] <j0rd> sharyari: it's good
[09:25] <eltese> Hi. I want to burn a DVD record (containing photos, music etc) and tried to install a burning program called GnomeBaker. I used the command : sudo aptitude install GnomeBaker... But I cant seem to find it and the guide says it should be in Program->Video&Sound, but cant find it.. And also.. Do I need to do something special before I can burn DVD's?
[09:25] <j0rd> sharyari: it's got a gui
[09:25] <j0rd> sharyari: maybe it can help you
[09:25] <sharyari> j0rd: I know, I'm just acting dumb to get help actually
[09:26] <sharyari> I've been using linux for a few years =D
[09:26] <j0rd> sharyari: i usually just do this
[09:26] <j0rd> sharyari: i get help in 5 seconds
[09:26] <cached> and i dont get any help :(
[09:26] <j0rd> WINDOWS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN LINUX. LINUX CANT EVEN MOUNT MY DVD PLAYER
[09:26] <j0rd> and then you get help in like 5 seconds
[09:26] <cached> j0rd: right on
[09:26] <j0rd> :P
[09:26] <DARKGuy> Uhm, whatever
[09:26] <cached> is there just some file that i could edit to get grub to recognize /dev/hda1 as a possible boot source for ubuntu?
[09:27] <cached> GRUB only recognizes the windows partition now
[09:27] <mrstocks> hi
[09:27] <eltese> Cant anyone help me?
[09:27] <w3ccv> cached, /boot/grub/menu.lst
[09:27] <MRabbit> too slow to move mouse, let alone kill stuff
[09:27] <cached> eltese: try typing gnomebaker into terminal and see what happens
[09:27] <cached> w3ccv: what do i edit it to
[09:27] <MRabbit> are there any boot options to run live with minimal processes
[09:28] <davascript_work> j0rd: cant work linux so he has to complain about it
[09:28] <eternal_p> good adfternoon all, I have  PCMCIA BT card, which I know ubuntu supports, but I can't seem to start it...what command do I need to get it going?
[09:28] <tristan_> I dont understand people who barge into an irc channel demanding help
[09:28] <Kazero> How do I edit startuo scripts in 6.10?
[09:28] <JVolt> Do anyone know what's happening wrong here:
[09:28] <JVolt> I'm trying run amule, but it return a error: amule: error while loading shared libraries: libwx_gtk2_qa-2.6.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
[09:28] <JVolt> I has seen and that libwx_gtk2...so.0 is in /usr/local/lib. What could me do for it run right?
[09:28] <tristan_> as if anyone owed them help
[09:28] <tristan_> man
[09:28] <ubun> won't just installing 'vlc' do most of what running automatix or easyubuntu would do?
[09:28] <tristan_> if someone has support for you in 5 seconds, then your lucky, thats all.
[09:29] <bledy> Does anyone know a free LAN software to make videoconference calls, transfer files, chat ... etc?
[09:29] <w3ccv> cached,  I don't have a umbutu grub handy and a FC4 would confuse the issue
[09:29] <ubun> people demand help from free software more than proprietary software for some reason
[09:29] <JVolt> bledy:  i has seen it running sometime, but never has installed it
[09:29] <tristan_> seriously
[09:29] <tristan_> they barge in and accuse the channel for not responding to a question
[09:30] <tristan_> and most times the question is "I need help setting up my dual head display, can someone help me ?"
[09:30] <MRabbit> are there any options on ubuntu 6.10 i386 cd to run live with minimal processes so that it runs fast enough to install
[09:30] <ubun> why love windows, windows doesn't love you
[09:30] <recon> Does anybody know of a program that can make a linux SWF (flash file) projector maker like flix or SWF studio that will run on linux?
[09:30] <tristan_> not a practicle question like "I started my servers and got this error message, why ?"
[09:30] <JVolt> true
[09:30] <eternal_p> any thoughts?  I remember  my first attenpt at ubuntu, I had to execute a command to start bluetooht, I can't remember what it is
[09:30] <JVolt> windows just love your  money while you yet have it
[09:30] <sindrum> how tdo i go about unistalling netbeans?...installed manually and is not on synaptic list
[09:32] <Geoffrey2> could problems with Flash be a video driver problem?
[09:32] <eltese> If I type GnomeBaker in the terminal

I was able to connect to the drive using the "Connect to server" option in the Places menu. The mounted drive/folder appears on my desktop. How do I get Amarok to see it?

[09:44] <jellyrools> sinisterguy: whenever i try to boot ubuntu from the menu on the CD the text 'loading' appears, and it just stops. the mennu doesnt disappear
[09:45] <michalus_> sindrum, is somethig like dpkg-reconfigure java... or something like it - you can choose JRE/JDK
[09:45] <michalus_> i do it but now i forget the name
[09:45] <tristan_> ubun, I dont think you'd have to be very very good - I think its more a matter of recording problems and solutions into a database and keeping a support office open for a long term
[09:45] <ubun> when i install a package with synaptic does it log all of what it installed (dependencies) to a file somewhere?
[09:45] <sinisterguy> brussel: i don't believe there's specific ubuntu support, but if you're willing to do a little tinkering there is some support for linux: http://g15tools.sourceforge.net/
[09:46] <eonbaluze> anyone mess w/ dansguardian and ubuntu

[09:59] <MRabbit> does anybody know how to make the ubuntu 6.10 i386 cd use an existing swap partition
[09:59] <DARKGuy> orion2012: I have Xubuntu actually, but yeah, that one did work when I had ubuntu, but it had no options about it
[09:59] <DARKGuy> brb, phone
[09:59] <weiers> hehe, lol ... maybe I should ask this: I've really tried to get Xchat to open links into Firefox, but it insists on opening them into Mozilla Browser. Can I change this?
[09:59] <kitche> weiers: in preferences or did you already do that?
[10:00] <kitche> MRabbit: just swapon <device> and it should use it
[10:00] <jrib> weiers: sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser    or something similar
[10:00] <orion2012> DARKGuy: Ah, well, it should do an all channel tone. As for positional sound testing, I'm not sure.

[10:01] <DARKGuy> !

[10:02] <weiers> thanks very much jrib and kitche [jrib's suggestion worked] 
[10:02] <michalus_> sindrum, ;)
[10:02] <MRabbit> kk, its just that its too slow to do that
[10:02] <sindrum> then i tried sudo update-alternatives --config java , then did selection 3
[10:02] <sindrum> worked like a charm
[10:02] <sindrum> thanks
[10:02] <julianx> but you can use the root prompt if you use the "recovery mode"
[10:02] <dave> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35958/
[10:02] <kitche> MRabbit: you might be able to do it on boot but it depends if the cd has the option for it
[10:02] <Cephei> can i ask a question , or is there a different channel for help?
[10:03] <MRabbit> no menu option, and i dunno whether i can put it as a boot option
[10:03] <orion2012> Cephei: you're in the right place
[10:03] <jrib> dave: I lied, it used to work for me I swear, but now it doesn't :P  Anyway here's a promising bug report: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/sun-java5/+bug/69493
[10:04] <julianx> Cephei you can give your ask maybe i can help you
[10:04] <dave> you get the same error?
[10:04] <julianx> i'm sorry but English is not my native language

[10:05] <michalus_> bledy, open what?
[10:05] <dave> ahh
[10:06] <LookTJ> what ftp client would you guys recommend?
[10:06] <Cephei> i have just installed ubunto, and i want to egt acces to my windows partition, so i am following this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/partitions-booting.html#id2592810 , at a certain point it sais "Append the following line at the end of file: /dev/hda1 /media/windows ntfs umask=0222 0 0  and Replace /dev/hda1 with the correct device name for your partition.
[10:06] <Cephei> If your Windows partition uses the FAT32 filesystem, replace ntfs with vfat in the above command.
[10:06] <Cephei> If you have a FAT32 filesystem, it is also safe to allow read-write access. To do this, change the value of umask to 0000.", my question is, do i have to change "/dev/hda1" with the name of the drive where ubuntu is installed or with the name of the drive i want to acces
[10:06] <bledy> michalus_, how can i open wengo, gismo?
[10:06] <DARKGuy> LookTJ: I like GFTP
[10:06] <KenSentMe> Someone has flightgear installed? How do i start the game?

[10:07] <LookTJ> orion2012: sure
[10:07] <jrib> oops
[10:07] <Cephei> so if anyone can help me with my long question? :P
[10:07] <michalus_> LookTJ, gFTP is crappy ;)
[10:07] <orion2012> LookTJ: nautilus works well for FTP, there's also gftp
[10:07] <orion2012> !gftp > LookTJ
[10:07] <LookTJ> gftp sucks

[10:07] <orion2012> LookTJ: non taken, I didn't write it.
[10:07] <falleN_> greetings
[10:08] <DARKGuy> lol
[10:08] <finalbeta> gftp could be great though, they just have a really dumb GUI.

[10:08] <Cephei> so darkkguy, do i have type /hdd1 (name of my drive) or /dev/hdd1 ?
[10:08] <michalus_> finalbeta, i agree
[10:08] <DARKGuy> Cephei: /dev/hdd1
[10:08] <zcat[1] > curious; installing xubuntu, the installer says it's crashed and mouse/keyboard are nonresponsive, but the cdrom and hdd are still doing stuff. I have a feeling only teh gui crashed and the install is proceeding normally in the background.
[10:08] <MRabbit> YAY! tty2 is your friend for lagging live and swapon command
[10:08] <Cephei> thanks
[10:08] <dave> sun-java5 in the repoisitory the same ?
[10:08] <orion2012> LookTJ: http://gnomefiles.org/ has a pretty comprehensive list of GNOME apps, you might find something you like on there
[10:08] <DARKGuy> *thinks
[10:08] <bledy> michalus_, Ok. I'll open that now. Thnk you.
[10:08] <jrib> dave: I renamed ~/.azureus and it works now
[10:09] <jrib> dave: what did you mean by "sun-java5 in the repoisitory the same ?"
[10:09] <finalbeta> gftp should use the same GUI like FlashFXP in windows does. That's handy.
[10:09] <ephesius> every so often my ipw2100 wireless adapter seems to be causing problems with edgy
[10:10] <Cephei> so now i can acces my drive in the /media/windows folder?
[10:10] <Cephei> after a reboot
[10:10] <michalus_> finalbeta, do you see fireftp extension to firefox? it's handy
[10:10] <jrib> Cephei: put them in fstab
[10:10] <dave> thought you were giving me a link to a sun java tar.gz
[10:10] <finalbeta> michalus_, but it can't do half the things I need it to do.

[10:10] <dave> but im gunna try renaming like you said
[10:11] <michalus_> finalbeta, but it's has better GUI
[10:11] <jrib> dave: ok, but yes sun java is in the repos
[10:11] <asgilder> Am I gonna have to hose Linux to get both Windows AND Linux to boot again?
[10:11] <DARKGuy> Weird
[10:11] <finalbeta> michalus_, okey, let's call it a cute blond then. Looks great, but doesn't do much.
[10:11] <finalbeta> michalus_,  ;)
[10:11] <Cephei> ok jrib, since im a total noob i dont know what you were talking about
[10:11] <DARKGuy> speaker-test works (though I hear no stereo on the front speakers) and the back speakers when speaker-test tests themdon't sound (but they do when I play music with XMMS) - how come?
[10:11] <michalus_> finalbeta, hehehe
[10:12] <jrib> Cephei: read the link ubotu gave you.  Let me know if anything isn't clear in that link and I will try to explain
[10:12] <Catshrimp> Hey guys, what's happening?
[10:12] <Cephei> ok thanks
[10:12] <Cephei> ill first reboot :p
[10:12] <michalus_> finalbeta, but when you'd like to SFTP etc. you can use sshfs and mount it as drive what do you need more?
[10:12] <jrib> Cephei: why?
[10:13] <dave> woo fixed it
[10:13] <Cephei> because it sais "#
[10:13] <Cephei> The changes will take effect when the computer is restarted.
[10:13] <Cephei> "
[10:13] <dave> thanks
[10:13] <jrib> Cephei: oh ok
[10:13] <Catshrimp> Hm, I'll be back in a bit, seems I have just a little more configuration before I have irssi just how I like it :)
[10:13] <finalbeta> michalus_, that's really not handy. I do many site to site transfers.
[10:13] <dave> me and azureus have a lot of catching up to do
[10:13] <julianx> you can create a script sh if you don't use everyday your windows partition

[10:14] <brussel> Sinisterguy: Thanks for looking that up but I don't want to mess with anything that can't be added with the synaptic package.
[10:15] <julianx> brussel ?? where are you?
[10:15] <brussel> julianx: San Diego
[10:15] <d1gital> caphei:  to be more pricise on what julianx said:
[10:15] <d1gital> mkdir /media/windows
[10:15] <d1gital> mount -t vfat /dev/hda1
[10:15] <d1gital> replace the tstype(vfat) and drive (/dev/hda1) with yours
[10:15] <belfegorash> do u know a program like skype? or maybe skype?
[10:15] <brussel> julianx: Why?
[10:15] <belfegorash> is working on ubuntu?
[10:16] <d1gital> i think skype is
[10:16] <d1gital> i know ekiga is
[10:16] <julianx> i thought... you are from belgium
[10:16] <d1gital> it is defaultly installed
[10:16] <belfegorash> ok thanks
[10:16] <brussel> Julianx: I wished!
[10:17] <zcat[1] > !skype
[10:17] <ubotu> To install Skype on Ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype  -  To record on Skype, check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto
[10:17] <Cephei> hey jrib, i followed the step "Make partitions automatically available" from this guide, https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/partitions-booting.html#id2592810
[10:17] <Cephei> but there isnt anything in the windows folder :P
[10:17] <brussel> Sinisterguy or anybody else: Is there a key map i can manipulate to get this keyboard to work as I expect it to?
[10:18] <julianx> I'm on brussel every day for the learn
[10:18] <orion2012> Cephei: you have to actually mount it as well
[10:18] <brussel> julianx: I'm not sure what you mean you are on the brussel every day. Is that a train? And what's the learn? Is it a place?
[10:18] <orion2012> Cephei: something like "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/device_name /media/windows"
[10:19] <Cephei> hmm, maybe its because i wrote "hdd" instead of "hdd1" , but there are no partitions so i think "hdd" was correct, or maybe its because another HDD, not a partition ont he same drive
[10:19] <d1gital> try hdd0
[10:19] <zcat[1] > Cephei: 'no partitions' usually means 'one partition, hdd1'
[10:19] <d1gital> its impossible for there to be no partitions
[10:20] <d1gital> well not impossible
[10:20] <d1gital> just stupid
[10:20] <Cephei> hehe ok then i should write, "hdd1"?
[10:20] <zcat[1] > d1gital: not impossible, just really really unusual (perhaps impossible for windows, definately possible with linux)
[10:20] <Cephei> i think iw as stupid, cause i never partitioned that drive
[10:20] <julianx> ho i'm sorry
[10:20] <Cephei> , so it was "hdd" after all?
[10:20] <d1gital> zcat:  what would be the advantage of doing such a thing?
[10:20] <zcat[1] > Cephei: it WILL be hdd1
[10:21] <brussel> Why on edgy desktop isn't there a menu item to start up vim?
[10:21] <Cephei> ok then i'll have to change the file
[10:21] <zcat[1] > d1gital: none at all. But you can do it.
[10:21] <orion2012> brussel: it's there, it's just disabled
[10:21] <brussel> orion2012: How do I enable it?
[10:21] <orion2012> brussel: if you have gVim installed, you can right click Applications, and click edit menus
[10:21] <julianx> i'm student in brussels
[10:22] <orion2012> brussel: it should be under Accessories
[10:22] <Cephei> ok changed the file, now reboot again :p
[10:22] <brussel> orion2012: Is gvim a package I can load with Synaptic?
[10:22] <d1gital> zcat: so you can just basically throw files onto a drive?  (obviously i am a recently converted windows user)  but don't you need a filesystem to save files, and a partition to have a filesystem?
[10:22] <jrib> brussel: gnome-vim or vim-gnome, I forget which one
[10:22] <orion2012> brussel: vim-gtk
[10:22] <orion2012> brussel: sorry, yeah, vim-gnome
[10:23] <zcat[1] > Cephei: you shouldn't need to reboot, just alt-F2 and type "mount /media/windows"
[10:23] <jrib> gtk would work too
[10:23] <brussel> JulianX I chose the name brussel because Bertrand Russel was my childhood hero.
[10:23] <Mystery47> im worker in finland....;)
[10:23] <zcat[1] > d1gital: you can create a silesystem on a few devide; it's a bit tricky and totally pointless.
[10:23] <zcat[1] > *device
[10:23] <brussel> orion2012: Thanks, I'll download it now
[10:24] <d1gital> zcat:  ok.. well anything's possible with linux i suppose
[10:24] <zcat[1] > d1gital: anyhow.. for all practical purposes it's neevr done. "No partitions" doesn't happen. When people say they didn't partition they always mean there's no partitions other than the first one..
[10:25] <Cephei> wicked, i rebooted and now i have the drive on my desktop!
[10:25] <zcat[1] > Cephei: you shouldn't need to reboot, just alt-F2 and type "mount /media/windows"
[10:25] <Cephei> and i can open pictures
[10:25] <Cephei> do i still have to do something?
[10:25] <zcat[1] > Cephei: no, since you already rebooted.. But you didn;'t need to.
[10:26] <Cephei> ok so now, everything will work fine, in theory?
[10:26] <shadowhywind> what is a konsole command to grab an ip addy?
[10:26] <zcat[1] > It seems so.
[10:26] <d1gital> ifconfig
[10:26] <Cephei> thanks!
[10:26] <d1gital> !ifconfig
[10:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ifconfig - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:26] <shadowhywind> ifconfig doesn't grab an ip
[10:26] <orion2012> shadowhywind: what do you mean by grab?
[10:26] <Cephei> sorry for my noobishness, but i'm not really a programmer and i've just installed ubuntu to try it out as alternative for windows
[10:26] <zcat[1] > dhclient
[10:27] <zcat[1] > !dhcp
[10:27] <shadowhywind> like dhcpcd will grab an ip
[10:27] <ubotu> dhcp: DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0pl5-19.4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 108 kB, installed size 308 kB
[10:27] <x-r00t-x> d1gital, are you tring to compile ?
[10:27] <Zaggynl> Someone help, I'm uploading pretty fast according to Netspeed, but I have no clue to whom or what!
[10:27] <zcat[1] > dhclient will request an IP from a dhcp server...
[10:27] <brussel> orion2012: Where does vim-gnome show up on the menu system? I've looked twice and I'll be darned if I can see it.
[10:27] <shadowhywind> and itlooks lik dhclient is not installed
[10:28] <zcat[1] > try pump ?
[10:28] <orion2012> brussel: when you first install it, it will be disabled, you'll have to edit the menu, it's under the Accessories category
[10:28] <brussel> orion2012: I should add I just installed it.
[10:28] <d1gital> x-r00t-x:  huh?
[10:29] <brussel> orion2012: That brings up an interesting question.. How do edit the menu?
[10:29] <belfegorash> u can tell me pls haw i can instal skype?
[10:29] <belfegorash> i cannot put into synaptic
[10:29] <atlef> getautomatix
[10:29] <orion2012> On the main menu (usually upper left corner), right click "Applications", then click edit menu
[10:29] <brussel> orion2012: Sorry for the stupid question, I should have looked first.
[10:30] <d1gital> x-r00t-x:  i'm not trying to compile anything.... why?
[10:30] <noodles12> in kdevelop, why do the errors for compilation show up in the messages tab and not the problems tab where the errors should be?

[10:42] <mdious> Hiya Darst
[10:42] <jevangelo> im trying to install ubuntu server on a sun sparc IIe system, and i type boot cdrom and it is waiting for "file and args"
[10:42] <Darst> mdious - any chance i could ask a q about media files and crashing X?
[10:42] <brussel> There's got to be a better way than randomly going through keyboard layouts until I find one that handles my escape key correctly.
[10:42] <Arwen> huh, I'm not banned anymore?
[10:43] <belfegorash> how can i add skype repository?
[10:43] <crashzor>  i have the shutdown problem and yes i did already create a kioskrc file in /etc/xdg/xfce4/kiosk/kioskrc ( its Xubuntu LTSP )
[10:43] <Arwen> is there an alternative to the X Window System?
[10:43] <gnomefreak> !skype | crashzor

[10:43] <tonyyarusso> Arwen: Apparently not.  Let's keep it that way ;)
[10:43] <mdious> Darst:  ask away, i won't be able to help at all though sorry hehe....sure someone will have an idea though
[10:43] <Arwen> belfegorash, edit /etc/apt/sources,list
[10:43] <webtoe> Arwen: there are other X window systems (or there were a cou0ple of years ago). try google?
[10:44] <crashzor> gnomefreak, i did't ask to install skype :S why i'm getting that 1 :P
[10:44] <Arwen> ...beryl crashed....
[10:44] <Arwen> anyway, is there an alternative to X Windows?
[10:44] <gnomefreak> crashzor: soirry
[10:44] <brussel> Anybody: Is there a package to let you map keystrokes to other keystrokes so I can get my goofy keyboard to act correctly?

[10:45] <Arwen> tonyyarusso, just wondering
[10:45] <nicola> guys where's the directory with all icons ?

[10:49] <omoore> why does Ubuntu 6.10 use 127.0.1.1 for the workstation hostname?

[11:02] <sod75> all, I'm on kubuntu edgy, my adept-notifier just told me there are 35 new updates, including Xorg,kdm, etc. Is there a way ( website?) you can check what is changed BEFORE applying these ? after all Version 4:3.5.5-0ubuntu3 to 4:3.5.5-0ubuntu3.2 isn't really descriptive....

[11:03] <kitche> sod75: packages.ubuntu.com will tell you since each package has a changelog
[11:03] <Yuuki> I'm not sure...  it's my roommate's computer, nothlit
[11:04] <sod75> Yuuki: should be fine
[11:04] <Yuuki> sod75, ubuntu proper should be fine?

[11:04] <d1gital> yuuki: i have the solution.........   buy your roommate some RAm for christmas
[11:05] <kitche> sod75: click on edgy then go to the bottom then click on debian changelog

[11:09] <matthew_w> Why do totem and mplayer refuse to function properly post-update?
[11:09] <Belter_> When I go into the GIMP I get a paint trail, how do i stop this?

[11:10] <st3v3dnd> Does anyone have any virtual hosting services they recommend that offer Ubuntu as the OS?
[11:10] <jrib> nicola: There is a way to force it to index and hog up your cpu, but I would recommend just letting it do its thing and doing something else in the meantime
[11:10] <jrib> x-r00t-x: hello
[11:10] <CharlieSu> Does anyone know of software raid can be used for / partition in Ubuntu?
[11:10] <dogmeat> i tried to install ubuntu from cdrom, but it didnt install a gui, X or window manager. how can i get these things installed from cdrom?
[11:10] <x-r00t-x> hi jrib
[11:10] <kitche> sod75: wellthat is probably just a patch there's nothing really different between 3 and 3.2 beside a patch probably
[11:10] <Hexo[AG] > I'm having problems with this
[11:10] <jrib> dogmeat: install ubuntu-desktop  to get what you get with Ubuntu
[11:10] <Kootaphor> Hi--I'm trying to get the "avahi-daemon" dealie working, and I realize I'm kind of in the dark about how computers on my LAN talk to each other.  I believe the issue is that, while I can ping machines on my network from one to another via local IP number, they don't know each other's "name"--any help?
[11:11] <tonyyarusso> dogmeat: Which CD did you use?
[11:11] <Hexo[AG] > I can't write to the NTFS or FAT32 partitions I've mounted in ubuntu
[11:11] <nicola> jrib, I'll just wait
[11:11] <Hexo[AG] > Is there a solution for this?
[11:11] <jrib> !ntfs | Hexo[AG] 
[11:11] <ubotu> Hexo[AG] : To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[11:11] <orion2012> Kootaphor: you need to edit /etc/default/avahi-daemon to enable it
[11:11] <frank_b> I can't change my font in firefox... isn't it a simple matter of going to Edit -> Preferences -> Content -> Fonts & Colors? whatever font I choose there it remains the same...
[11:11] <jrib> Hexo[AG] : set the proper options in fstab
[11:11] <Hexo[AG] > ty
[11:11] <dakilla_>  i got a apt/k3d problem
[11:11] <orion2012> Kootaphor: or have you aalready done so?
[11:11] <dakilla_> http://allt.mine.nu/b/aptError
[11:11] <orion2012> dakilla_: I already answered you
[11:11] <matthew_w> Serious problems here - movie stuff doesn't work at all after yesterday's "update"

[11:12] <ubotu> matthew_w: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[11:12] <i7ch> is there any unofficial repository when i can download debs of recent kernels compiled for ubuntu?
[11:12] <Kootaphor> orion2012 - no, haven't done that. I created that file on my own per advice on the Ubuntu page--but it was just something like AVAHI_DAEMON_START=1  - nothing else.
[11:12] <dogmeat> used Ubuntu 6.06 Server
[11:12] <Belter_> How do I turn the paint trail of when I enter the GIMP
[11:12] <sports_fan> ok that didn't work, is ther ssh install i have to do ? apt-get install ssh (?)
[11:13] <sod75> kitche: that's what I'm trying to find out, exactly what ... anyway, I'll just let them be for a while ....but I'm not sure businesses would like this
[11:13] <orion2012> Kootaphor: if you had to create it on yoyr own, then you either haven't installed avahi properly or you deleted it
[11:13] <matthew_w> More information:  The error that totem yields is "Subsampling in JPEG-LS is not Supported"
[11:13] <Staz> Can I upgrade to edgy from dapper using just my edgy cd?
[11:13] <davascript_work> to restart ssh you would run /etc/init.d/sshd restart sports_fan

[11:14] <Staz> bugger
[11:14] <brainsik> staz: doubtful all your packages are on that disc
[11:14] <CharlieSu> Does anyone know of software raid can be used for / partition in Ubuntu?
[11:14] <brainsik> staz: but i really don't recommend upgrading
[11:14] <CharlieSu> can software raid (MD) be used with the / partition?  I'm trying to setup RAID level 1 for my / partition...
[11:14] <Staz> heh
[11:14] <Kootaphor> orion2012 - Hmm-- I apt-getted it, and it seems to be up and running (avahi-browse on the local machine shows it running) - but no other computers on my network could see it.
[11:15] <Hexo[AG] > What file system would you recommend for an external drive that I would be going back and forth between windows with?
[11:15] <jrib> FluxAR: looks like a bug in the package.  Please pastebin 'apt-cache policy k3d'.  Have you searched bugs.ubuntu.com?
[11:15] <sports_fan> still connection refused.
[11:15] <necrodrako> whats a good temporary file/junk cleaner program?
[11:15] <davascript_work> Hexo[AG] : fat32
[11:15] <sports_fan> how do i install it so can have ssh access?
[11:15] <Hexo[AG] > thanks
[11:15] <davascript_work> or ext2 withthe windows driver
[11:15] <orion2012> Kootaphor: avahi browse is _not_ the avahi daemon
[11:15] <davascript_work> the reiserfs driver for windows is buggy
[11:15] <jrib> Hexo[AG] : I'd prefer ext3 with the fs-driver on windows
[11:15] <nothlit> Hexo[AG] , for the least hassle, FAT, otherwise ext2/3 or NTFS if you want to add drivers for that
[11:15] <jrib> !ext3 | Hexo[AG] 
[11:15] <ubotu> Hexo[AG] : ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[11:15] <davascript_work> apt-get install openssh
[11:15] <FluxAR> jrib, I want to make dpkg or apt to ignore that k3d package that seems to have a bug, and has a pending action
[11:15] <LinAsH> necrodrako, 'rm' ;)
[11:15] <orion2012> Kootaphor: sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
[11:16] <davascript_work> search with apt-cache search ssh
[11:16] <sports_fan> that will install the ssh so can remote in ?
[11:16] <Hexo[AG] > thank you so much :D
[11:16] <jrib> FluxAR: we can probably just edit the preremoval script and fix the bug, it's a typo
[11:16] <nothlit> sponix, sudo aptitude install openssh-server && sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
[11:16] <chalcedony> I get an error when trying to open Audacity (sound program): "there was an error initializing the audio i/o layer. You will not be able to play or record audio." That probably means something is using the soundcard, how do I find out what it is, and turn it off?
[11:16] <dogmeat> my ubuntu install doesn't have X installed. what packages should i install ?
[11:16] <nothlit> sports_fan, sudo aptitude install openssh-server && sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
[11:16] <Kootaphor> orion2012 - I did exactly that: and just used avahi-browse to see if it was up...it looks like it is.
[11:16] <necrodrako> where do i get 'rm'
[11:17] <FluxAR> jrib, yes, but how can I restore now my dpkg database? Now I can't use apt or dpkg because of that pending action :(
[11:17] <brainsik> nothlit: ssh will start automatically on install
[11:17] <kitche> dogmeat: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[11:17] <dogmeat> thanks
[11:17] <chalcedony> necrodrako: rm isn't in there?
[11:17] <davascript_work> thats not good if it starts without you telling it to
[11:17] <jrib> FluxAR: can you pastebin 'apt-cache policy k3d' please?
[11:17] <chalcedony> necrodrako: maybe download bash first?
[11:17] <FluxAR> jrib, of course... just a sec
[11:18] <necrodrako> what is rm
[11:18] <necrodrako> does rm stand for something?
[11:18] <davascript_work> remove
[11:18] <chalcedony> necrodrako: rm ReMove
[11:18] <necrodrako> add/ramove?

[11:22] <chalcedony> evad: none of those should block Audacity should the?

[11:22] <chalcedony> ok ty evad :)
[11:22] <jrib> orion2012: thanks, FluxAR did you look over that thread, would save some time :)
[11:22] <nothlit> rizo_, just use defaults 0 2
[11:22] <evad> chalcedony: close firefox, or the tab/window which is doing sound
[11:22] <FluxAR> jrib, I'm looking at it now... let's see

[11:28] <FluxAR> jrib, Ok .... I'll try.
[11:28] <LinAsH> linux_kid, you mean in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default ?
[11:28] <boink> edgy appears to be working after that first reboot
[11:28] <jrib> FluxAR: make a backup before editing that file

[11:31] <sports_fan> i need remote access to this box
[11:31] <sports_fan> we had it working last night
[11:32] <vonderer> hi there!
[11:32] <kitche> sports_fan: go to /etc/init.d/ and see if you have the sshd script in there and if it's executable
[11:32] <ubun> ubuntu needs a better default irc client than xchat
[11:32] <vonderer> where can i find packages, downloaded with apt-get?
[11:32] <jrib> vonderer: /var/cache/apt/archives/
[11:32] <vonderer> thx
[11:32] <orion2012> ubun: there's xchat-gnome, which is the edgy default, which is pretty much the same thing :)
[11:33] <kitche> ubun: well considering xchat is one of the more popular irc clients but there is others
[11:33] <sports_fan> i only have a ssh
[11:33] <ubun> is there a gui front end to irssi?
[11:33] <Spee_Der> ubun: I'm using the irc built into Opera.
[11:33] <orion2012> ubun: or irssi, my personal favorite
[11:33] <sports_fan> no sshd
[11:33] <FluxAR> jrib, orion2012 : thanks for your helping today! I solved my problem!
[11:33] <orion2012> ubun: no
[11:33] <ubun> irssi is nice even in console
[11:33] <jrib> FluxAR: great, how did you end up doing it?
[11:34] <kitche> sports_fan: do you have anything ssh in there?
[11:34] <DARKGuy> ubun: it is :)
[11:34] <Spee_Der> Good evening DARK
[11:34] <boink> for gui, use xchat
[11:34] <sports_fan> all i have is one file called ssh
[11:34] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Evenin' :) how it's goin' ^^
[11:34] <kitche> sports_fan: that might be the script
[11:34] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Brrrrrrr for the moment anyway, you ?
[11:34] <sports_fan> when i execute it tells me can't load some key file
[11:34] <ziox> hi
[11:34] <ziox> is there anyone in here?
[11:35] <Hexo[AG] > Ok so I formatted this hdd with ext3, but I can't write to it because I'm not owner? O.o

[11:35] <DARKGuy> !anyone | ziox
[11:35] <ubotu> ziox: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[11:35] <j0rd> belfegorash: it's more like does skype support ubuntu
[11:35] <DARKGuy> lol
[11:36] <j0rd> belfegorash: but the answer is yes, download the debian package from their website
[11:36] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Really, I'll have a look tomorrow when I return from Boston area and have time to do so.
[11:36] <ubun> how can i get gnome terminal to not conflict with irssi as far as switching hidden windows with ALT+n ?

[11:36] <belfegorash> and is deb file
[11:36] <jrib> ubun: I disabled the shortcuts in gnome-terminal's prefs
[11:36] <belfegorash> how to install?
[11:36] <boink> josh: you need to adjust your sources.list
[11:36] <boink> then install w32codecs
[11:36] <j0rd> belfegorash: dpkg -i *.deb
[11:36] <ziox> Depeche mode rules!
[11:36] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: It really is :) though, icons are way larger (like, 64x64 and I dunno where to change the size >.<) but it's alright nonetheless, even prettier too and easier to set up :D
[11:36] <sports_fan> i need ssh_nost_rsa_key
[11:36] <josh_> i have the codecs installed
[11:36] <Hexo[AG] > So when I format a drive using GParted and mount it there, I can't write to it from user account?
[11:36] <Hexo[AG] > This is all so confusing
[11:36] <belfegorash> ok i will try
[11:37] <j0rd> belfegorash: as root bttw
[11:37] <Hexo[AG] > I tried changing permissions, but it doesn't allow me, presumably because I'm not root :/
[11:37] <josh_> next?
[11:37] <kitche> sports_fan: it doen't matter but you don't have the ssh keys that should be made when sshd is started
[11:37] <jrib> Hexo[AG] : how did you try?
[11:37] <worldjam> hello is there an easy way to go from 64bit ubuntu to 32bit or just need to download the 32bit and delete the 64bit?
[11:37] <jrib> worldjam: reinstall
[11:37] <Hexo[AG] > right click in the file browser and properties? :S
[11:37] <j0rd> Hexo[AG] : you have to be root to change that permission
[11:37] <Hexo[AG] > I can't make out how to use chmod :(
[11:37] <jrib> Hexo[AG] : join me in #ubuntu-classroom please   /join #ubuntu-classroom
[11:38] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Thanks for the heads-up on that, I have made note and will scope it out as well . . . . For the moment, I'm just chillin' with a few cold ones after a long work day. . . .  Hope all is well with you too..
[11:38] <j0rd> Hexo[AG] : chmod ugo+rwx $FILE
[11:38] <josh_> chmod {attrib} {file}

[11:38] <j0rd> u = user, g = group, o = other, r = read, w = write, x = execute
[11:38] <j0rd> Hexo[AG] : ^
[11:38] <kitche> j0rd: won't work for a volume
[11:38] <josh_> man chmod
[11:38] <j0rd> kitche: chmod?
[11:38] <ubun> jrib: i disabled them but they're still working, even after i restarted gnome-terminal :/
[11:38] <worldjam> so there is no way to just install a 32bit over the top of a 64bit you just have to format?
[11:39] <jrib> ubun: weird
[11:39] <kitche> j0rd: he wants permissions to write to a volume or disk as user
[11:39] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Hehe, that's really nice :) - it is thanks ^^ learnin' some Mono and such =)
[11:39] <Spee_Der> Hmmmmm
[11:39] <freesun> hello, if there is a driver for a piece of hardware that is written for RedHat, but sourcecode is included, would it, recompiled work under ubuntu?
[11:39] <DARKGuy> Hm, chown?
[11:39] <j0rd> kitche: Hexo[AG]  login as root then and do it
[11:39] <belfegorash> when i login as root ...i write sudo...and?
[11:39] <j0rd> belfegorash: sudo su -
[11:39] <lubix> you dont long in as root
[11:39] <j0rd> belfegorash: will get you into root
[11:39] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Where to locate ROX ? I did apt-cache search rox and WOW, what a list it provided. . . .
[11:39] <kitche> j0rd: well considering ubuntu doesn't use root by default but you can do the same thing with umask when you mount it
[11:40] <belfegorash> ok
[11:40] <sports_fan> ok, so it's not starting
[11:40] <j0rd> belfegorash: or `sudo $cmdToRunAsRoot
[11:40] <j0rd> belfegorash: or `sudo $cmdToRunAsRoot`
[11:40] <sports_fan> whats a workaround?
[11:40] <orion2012> sports_fan: try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server"
[11:40] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Lol! it is big xD (tip: when doing apt-cache search and know a part of the package you want, you can type the first letters and tab completion will come! :D), rox-filer is what you want ^^
[11:40] <j0rd> kitche: that's what i would have suggested, but i dont want to explain that to him
[11:40] <sports_fan> ok
[11:40] <ubun> jrib: actually i did it wrong nm, it works
[11:41] <j0rd> kitche: i'd run the GUI thinger he's using with `sudo gparted` and do what ever he needs like that
[11:41] <ubuntu> does ATI drivers support radeon 9200?
[11:41] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Aha ! Thanks. I was looking at that too, will scope it out and see what kind of havock I can reek into this computer. . . . .
[11:41] <sports_fan> nope\
[11:41] <sports_fan> nothing
[11:41] <sports_fan> same error
[11:42] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Haha xD you're welcome, good luck setting it up :) if you use fluxbox o blackbox or anything related, you can follow a HowTo I found to set it up here too ^^
[11:42] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Danke' shein. . .
[11:42] <belfegorash> i canot login
[11:42] <ValMarko> Hello :) I need plugins for watching Tv on firefox browser. Anybody help me?
[11:42] <DARKGuy> ^^
[11:42] <ValMarko> plugins equivalent to w media player
[11:43] <belfegorash> where i put password?
[11:43] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: It's installing now. . . .
[11:43] <gilt> hello everybody
[11:43] <DARKGuy> ValMarko: mplayer is the WMP for Firefox under Linux
[11:43] <cntb> pls any expert in international keyboard tuning
[11:43] <gilt> can anybody tell me what version of video4linux does ubuntu has in kernel
[11:43] <ValMarko> where can I get it?
[11:43] <DARKGuy> ValMarko: I installed it using Automatix2, I dunno how would it be if you want to install it manually
[11:43] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Nice :)
[11:44] <apokryphos> !automatix
[11:44] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[11:44] <DARKGuy> Actually..
[11:44] <sports_fan> ok , i was wrong, it works now, i had a typo .. THANKS for you help !!
[11:44] <ValMarko> automatix2? tanks
[11:44] <kitche> sports_fan you have to generate the keys manually most likely
[11:44] <DARKGuy> ValMarko: check what ubotu says :P
[11:44] <ubun> now i'm scared to use automatix :(
[11:44] <DARKGuy> =S
[11:44] <ValMarko> Worksforme? where can I get it?
[11:44] <DARKGuy> !WorksForMe
[11:44] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[11:44] <freesun> If I have driver source code, does it matter for which distribution of linux it was written or it will instatnly run on ubuntu? it's usb->serial convertor driver
[11:44] <sebastian_> I've had huge problems with automatix. I can't recommend it.
[11:45] <belfegorash> dpkg -i skype_debian-1.3.0.53-1_i386.deb...and it doesnt working
[11:45] <ubun> i could apt-get everything i need anyway
[11:45] <DARKGuy> every machine is different :P
[11:45] <ubun> dont see the point of using a script
[11:45] <Kootaphor> orion2012 - re: the avahi stuff - I have no /etc/defaults/avahi-daemon file - but I do have an /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf file--same thing?
[11:45] <LjL> belfegorash: sudo dpkg
[11:45] <LjL> !doesn't work
[11:45] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[11:45] <kitche> freesun: doesn't matter since a driver will hook into the kernel anyways
[11:45] <orion2012> Kootaphor: no
[11:45] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Nice ! 8-)
[11:45] <freesun> thanks kitche
[11:45] <j1p> Is there a command I can use to figure out what my video card is? I know its integrated but I'm not sure what exactly it is
[11:46] <belfegorash> i am logged as root
[11:46] <agent> how do i check what device was mounted at a certain mount point if it is not listed in fstab?
[11:46] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: =) it is, way better than iDesk in some aspects :P (and it doesn't conflicts with the composite manager!)
[11:46] <ValMarko> So you recomend Worksforme?

[11:46] <agent> j1p: lspci
[11:46] <orion2012> Kootaphor: If you don't have the /etc/defaults file, then something is _wrong_. Like I said earlier, you either accidentally removed it or don't have the package installed. Try reinstalling it.
[11:46] <ubun> easyubuntu might be safer than automatix
[11:46] <kitche> j1p: you can do glxinfo|grep driver and find out what driver it is using
[11:46] <agent> j1p: lspci -v or even lspci -vv for a but load of info
[11:46] <j1p> thanks agent and kitche

[11:46] <agent> j1p: also, try lshw
[11:47] <LjL> belfegorash: it would help if you "cd"d to the right directory first... possibly "cd ~/Desktop" if it was downloaded to the desktop

[11:47] <DARKGuy> I wonder... does anybody know why in ktorrent, the speed goes up for a bit, then goes to zero, increases and decreases again... that never happened to me in Windows, is it normal? oO
[11:47] <belfegorash> yes is in the desktop
[11:48] <kitche> DARKGuy: that is normal it is bittorrent after all
[11:48] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Hehe okay, you're welcome :D - ah, have fun and enjoy ^^
[11:48] <agent> DARKGuy: it did that in windows too... windows just lies and tells you that it is constant
[11:48] <DARKGuy> kitche: weird, uTorrent/Azureus in Win don't do that here =/ or maybe they do and don't show it? oO
[11:48] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Ciao amigo & gracias ! ! !
[11:48] <DARKGuy> agent: Lol I see
[11:48] <Kootaphor> orion2012: hmm..I just did a "ls | grep defaults" and I got nothing.  I did just remove and reinstall avahi-daemon. I'm stuck.
[11:48] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: ^^ Ciao :D
[11:48] <gilt> can anybody tell me what version of video4linux does ubuntu has in kernel
[11:48] <agent> DARKGuy: don't trust windows for anything :)
[11:48] <kitche> DARKGuy: it depends on who your connected to and such also
[11:49] <DARKGuy> agent: since I entered the Linux world, not anymore :P
[11:49] <DARKGuy> kitche: I see o.o;
[11:49] <MagicFab> anyone from WV, USA ? Looking for any loco teams in or around WV
[11:49] <max_> where do you turn on the menu and kmenu transparency?
[11:50] <agent> DARKGuy: well, assuming that you have the same internet connection and are connected to the same node... the thing is, you may be using some far away unstable note - in truth, it could also be the bt client you are using - it may be buggy but the chances are very slim on that one
[11:50] <cntb> can left alt be both for alt-tab "walk through windows " and ISO_next_group as keyboard language changer ?
[11:50] <cntb> pls
[11:51] <gilt> hello guys..anybody tell me what version of video4linux does ubuntu has in kernel
[11:51] <zeR> Hi
[11:51] <ashley_> sup
[11:51] <orion2012> Kootaphor: "dpkg --list avahi*", does avahi-daemon turn up in the output?
[11:51] <ashley_> I love autmatix in ubuntu p
[11:51] <agent> DARKGuy: note = node... you are using the internet and are sharing files - there are a lot of things that happen but don't worry, it is very normal for your connection to go up and down especially when there are not many people sharing that file
[11:52] <ValMarko> where can I get WorksForMe?
[11:52] <ashley_> plus beryl I don't use windows anymore
[11:52] <agent> gilt: the version that came with the kernel :)
[11:52] <zeR> Ich wrde gerne auf meinen Webserver ein Skript stellen, dass nur die Eingabe eines youTube-Links bentigt und daraus ein MPG-File zum Download anbietet. Wei jemand vielleicht, ob es sowas schon gibt oder ob etwas berhaupt realisierbar ist?
[11:52] <DARKGuy> agent: I think you may be right - then again, Azureus just doesn't work if I kill the X because of (I assume) corrupt downloaded bits, and bittornado doesn't resume the torrents so :P

[11:52] <DARKGuy> agent: I see o.o;
[11:53] <cntb> can left alt be both for alt-tab "walk through windows " and ISO_next_group as keyboard language changer ?

[11:53] <DARKGuy> Ktorrent is the best one I've found xD;
[11:53] <tonyyarusso> ValMarko: We have no idea what you're talking about.
[11:53] <asgilder> Can you restore grub if you just have the Shipit! cd?
[11:53] <gilt> <you bet u were waiiting for this one
[11:53] <ashley_> I heard you can use utorrent with wine

[11:54] <ubotu> ValMarko: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[11:54] <max_> asgilder: yes
[11:54] <ubun> heh ubuntu says 'there is one update waiting' not used to linux doing that
[11:54] <agent> DARKGuy: well, that azureus thing is probably a bug in azureus - the question remains whether that means its a "real" bug or the bug that azureus uses java :)
[11:54] <kitche> ashley_: yes you can but it's not really called utorrent anymore anyways
[11:54] <max_> !grub | asgilder
[11:54] <ubotu> asgilder: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[11:54] <DARKGuy> agent: Maybe both ;) xD
[11:54] <ubun> bt clients should be made in python imo
[11:54] <asgilder> I went through all that, and just lost Windows, too.
[11:54] <ashley_> it's not kitche whats it called?
[11:54] <max_> no
[11:54] <agent> DARKGuy: probably....
[11:55] <agent> ubun: try deluge
[11:55] <max_> asgilder: you didnt lose it
[11:55] <max_> asgilder: you have to make a menu entry
[11:55] <kitche> ashley_: well considering that BitTorrent owns utorrent now
[11:55] <asgilder> Ah.
[11:55] <max_> asgilder: hold for link

[11:55] <amonkey> i'm looking for some software that can take podcasts(rss feeds) and burn them on a audio cd-rw automagically. anyone heard of something like it?
[11:56] <agent> DARKGuy: you are on kde, right? ive never had a problem with the default bt client in gnome, except that it is not possible to download multiple files at the same time (but thats not a bug) - you can try deluge its developed by ubuntu enthusiasts... it has its own forum on ubuntuforums
[11:56] <ashley_> anyone try the torrent downloader in opera?
[11:56] <kitche> amonkey: I only know of a script but not a program
[11:56] <B_H> i have mc now :P
[11:57] <ubun> mc?
[11:57] <amonkey> kitche, any pointer is good
[11:57] <ubun> ashley_ i have, it's good
[11:57] <DARKGuy> agent: actually, I'm in Fluxbox installed in a Xubuntu distro :P, and I can't recall the name of the default bt client in gnome.. what was it?
[11:57] <ashley_> kewl brb

[11:59] <Kootaphor> Having given up on avahi-- how do people listen to music over a Wireless Lan in their house (specifically, on different floors?  I have samba shares (ie just mount and pretend its a local hard drive) , but there's sometimes skipping. How have folks solved this problem? Maybe with a program that knows how to buffer?
[11:59] <jrib> ValMarko: did you install the plugin for firefox?  What package did you install?
[12:00] <ValMarko> ummm... just mplayer. from synaptic
[12:00] <ashley_> ValMarko, autmatix install all the plugins for firefox
[12:00] <pozdiy> what are the libs for OpenGL support under Edgy?
[12:00] <kitche> Kootaphor: well for stuff to be buffered you need to install a server like icecast or shoutcast
[12:00] <jrib> ValMarko: install mozilla-mplayer
