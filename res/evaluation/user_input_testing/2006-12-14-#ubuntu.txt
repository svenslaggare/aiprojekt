[12:08] <jota> hola atodos
[12:08] <crowley1027> but i know about pastebin.
[12:08] <markvandenborre> if I can open it using gnash, it's no problem
[12:08] <markvandenborre> otherwise, it is
[12:08] <devnull_> so reinstalling it is the same f'ing error
[12:08] <crowley1027> :) if it involves anything generally usable with windows i know it.
[12:08] <bimberi> crowley1027: yes, but I didn't know that you know :)
[12:08] <devnull_> whats the f'ing deal with debs anyway
[12:08] <crowley1027> i'm one of those people that are good with windows, bad with linux.
[12:08] <crowley1027> so i installed build-essential.
[12:08] <arrenlex> crowley1027: It's better to tell someone who might already know about pastebin how to use it, than to not tell someone and then find out that they don't. =P
[12:08] <crowley1027> can i install rtorrent now?
[12:08] <crowley1027> dir

[12:17] <Adil> robdeman: You could create a folder inside /etc/init.d and move it there. Doesnt matter where, as long as its not in that folder (can be in a subfolder though)

[12:36] <SNeeR> If I wanna patch my kernell Should I recompile it all when I patch it
[12:36] <Zakir> wakest: have you installed network-manager-gnome?
[12:36] <wakest> I just did the automatic install, from the live cd
[12:36] <bimberi> wakest: that probably means you have a broadcom card - this page will hopefully help - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:37] <bimberi> SNeeR: yes, you patch the kernel source so you need to recompile it
[12:37] <bimberi> !kernelcompile | SNeeR
[12:37] <ubotu> SNeeR: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[12:38] <_osiris> i was wondering if someone could help with a live CD install...i load up the live CD then i get an error saying cannot start gnome setting daemon after that when i click install nthing happens
[12:38] <buscon> Hi, is it possible to make an ubuntu mirror on a debian ?
[12:38] <arrenlex> buscon: On a debian what?
[12:38] <buscon> arrenlex, on a debian system
[12:38] <arrenlex> buscon: What are you trying to do?
[12:38] <ValMarko> I just installed Beryl. I'm amazed !! Now we're talking graphics :))
[12:39] <buscon> arrenlex, I need an ubuntu mirror for a lan of ubuntu machines, but I have only debian machines connected to the internet
[12:40] <jokoon> Hello back
[12:40] <GlutenBoy> Question: But first of all I must say that I'm now using Ubuntu as my primary OS for the first time and I don't regret it so far...
[12:40] <drkm> btw if anyone is interested... mounting with fstab with /dev/hd..... will only mount READ no matter what you set it as... will load properly if you use LABEL instead

[12:40] <mamonassassina> Hello people,I wanna know about iPods and iTunes.
[12:41] <Aji-Dahaka> apple.com
[12:41] <mamonassassina> Aji-Dahaka: thank you very much
[12:41] <arrenlex> XD
[12:41] <mamonassassina> i think i'll be banned if i say what i think about you right now in the channel
[12:41] <mamonassassina> anyway
[12:41] <mamonassassina> if anyone is here to help instead of making jokes.
[12:41] <bimberi> seconded :)
[12:41] <drkm> GlutenBoy: same here.. how long has it been your primary OS?
[12:41] <plesnivyjano> pls how to recover removed files??
[12:41] <bimberi> !ipod
[12:41] <ubotu> For information on how to sync and add tracks to your iPod, see the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto
[12:41] <mamonassassina> can i transfer files like a normal pendrive?
[12:42] <GlutenBoy> My question is: what is the best file system to share a drive between WinOS and Linux, should I use FAT32? Right now I use NTFS but I read that writing to this is still in beta (not always statble).
[12:42] <crowley1027> its updated
[12:42] <mamonassassina> bimberi: it can be answered with a yes or a no,i think it's easier to look for someone that can give me an answer rather than reading the how-to.
[12:42] <Aji-Dahaka> manuleviking: nope, but you can use other means ... chuck out gtkpod or amarok, perhaps
[12:42] <c0llin> hello
[12:43] <Zakir> you can't drag and drop files if you're using the basic apple OS... however, the rockbox firmware supports this.... try using GTKPOD or similar program for the basic apple firmware.
[12:43] <buscon> mamonassassina, rtfm
[12:43] <GlutenBoy> drkm: About a month or so
[12:43] <Aji-Dahaka> err... mamonassassina ^^you,rather

[12:43] <manuleviking> Aji-Dahaka: ;)
[12:43] <mamonassassina> buscon: osu.
[12:43] <bimberi> mamonassassina: yes, absolutely, but just in case no-one knows
[12:43] <mamonassassina> bimberi: sure.
[12:43] <arrenlex> GlutenBoy: Fat32, yes.
[12:43] <bimberi> mamonassassina: which is a yes to "it can be answered ..." :)
[12:44] <ValMarko> Mamonassassina, Ve-se logo que s portugues. Vai para casa aprender a ser educado e depois aparece por aqui
[12:44] <mamonassassina> buscon: i think "atfqostfu" would be better.but when i sent the first part i hadn't thought of the second part of it.
[12:44] <bimberi> !stfu

[12:46] <Aji-Dahaka> mamonassassina: I answered your question...
[12:46] <iratik> wow i walked in a weird answer
[12:46] <arrenlex> crowley1027: I think google might be more helpful in helping you find THAT. o_O
[12:46] <GlutenBoy> My god I think it's the first time I use IRC since high school...sorry a flashback
[12:47] <Mike> Hey guys, quick question.
[12:47] <mamonassassina> Aji-Dahaka: you did?you told me to go to apple.com
[12:47] <iratik> How do you upgrade breezy to the newest dist, have done "apt-get update&&apt-get upgrade&&apt-get dist-upgrade"
[12:47] <Aji-Dahaka> mamonassassina: after that...you know, after you asked your question
[12:47] <Mike> Is there a way to tell the cpu/memory usage and the like from the console?
=== dv5237_ is now known as dv5237
[12:47] <c0llin> could someone point me in the right direction to setting up raid 0 for server install?
[12:47] <Aji-Dahaka> Mike: top
[12:47] <mamonassassina> <Aji-Dahaka> err... mamonassassina ^^you,rather
[12:47] <mamonassassina> you mean,this?
[12:47] <iratik> Mike: top, uptime
[12:47] <arrenlex> mamonassassina: You were answered: (04:43:00 PM) Zakir: you can't drag and drop files if you're using the basic apple OS... however, the rockbox firmware supports this.... try using GTKPOD or similar program for the basic apple firmware.
[12:47] <mamonassassina> like...
[12:47] <buscon> mamonassassina, you could have read a lot of manuals...
[12:47] <Aji-Dahaka> mamonassassina: yeah, look just up from there
[12:47] <ra> I need to write to an NTFS disk. What's the best way to mount the partition? ntfs-3g or something else
[12:47] <linis_australis> greetings, Question for anyone: when I log in sometimes I am immediately logged back out. Also, when logging in on occasion I am bounced into command line login. Why is this happening?  nyone have any clues?
[12:47] <bimberi> !upgrade | iratik
[12:47] <ubotu> iratik: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[12:47] <Mike> Aji-Dahaka, iratik: Thank you both very much! :D
[12:48] <mamonassassina> up from there,the idiot telling me to read the manual?
[12:48] <george_> Do I have to uninstall gaim in edgy before installing the latest beta as a deb????
[12:48] <bimberi> george_: no, the package manager will handle that
[12:48] <george_> bimberi: thanks mate
[12:48] <Aji-Dahaka> mamonassassina: you hoon!  "nope, but you can use other means ... chuck out gtkpod or amarok, perhaps" <-- see that there that I wrote 6 minutes ago
[12:49] <arrenlex> mamonassassina: I think you should probably take "read the manual" as "I have absolutely no idea and probably shouldn't be answering this question anyway"... it doesn't seem that anyone who knows the answer is helping you, so just cool down and try again later, or use google. Sorry = /
[12:49] <mamonassassina> anyway,Zakir,thanks for the gtkpod thing.
[12:49] <ValMarko> Why dont you try Windows? There you can blasfem for free because you already paid for the product. Go ahead :)
[12:49] <mamonassassina> arrenlex: zakir helped me.aji-dahaka helped me.
[12:50] <mamonassassina> arrenlex: buscon had nothing to do with my question.here in brazil there is a saying that goes a little bit like "if you don't know how to help,then don't get on the way"
[12:50] <crowley1027> in the way*
[12:50] <mamonassassina> thanks.
[12:50] <crowley1027> no problem:)
[12:50] <bruenig> mamonassassina, there is a saying here that goes, fool me once.......shame on ...........you. Fool me twice....................you can't get fooled again.
[12:50] <iratik> Thanks
[12:51] <mamonassassina> bruenig: that didn't help me about my ipod.
[12:51] <crowley1027> ahahaha
[12:51] <buscon> mamonassassina, ok we're on a public list, sorry if I write...
[12:51] <crowley1027> pwnt.
[12:51] <bruenig> mamonassassina, but it is a saying...
[12:51] <ValMarko> Nobody is forced to help you. You're here at your own will. remember this.
[12:51] <crowley1027> touche-pwnt.
[12:52] <mamonassassina> ValMarko: absolutely
[12:52] <bruenig> ValMarko, that is not humanity towards others...shame on you
[12:52] <mamonassassina> at my own will,looking for help.
[12:52] <mamonassassina> and of course
[12:52] <ValMarko> Yahh... Humanity is your conduct ... eh eh.
[12:52] <crowley1027> about 18 hours for my pr0n?@!?!?!?!
[12:52] <mamonassassina> brazil is a free country,so,i can understand that people have the right to be idiots.
[12:52] <crowley1027> I only need 15 minutes of it!
[12:52] <GlutenBoy> Question 2:  In Synaptic Package Manager, what is the difference between Mark for removal and Mark for complete removal?
[12:52] <mamonassassina> just the way i have the right to get mad at them.
[12:52] <vanberge> is it quick/easy to configure plugins?  i.e. totem mozilla plugin plays videos right in my browser window?  i want vlc media to  open in a new window
[12:52] <ValMarko> Did you pay to act like a jerk with others?
[12:53] <Aji-Dahaka> brasil isn't a free country...but it sure ischeap
[12:53] <mamonassassina> GlutenBoy: i think complete removal removes all the "configuration"...thing of the package.
[12:53] <crowley1027> lol.,..
[12:53] <Aji-Dahaka> my company is constantly going there for the low-waged employment
[12:53] <arrenlex> Can we move the brazil argument to #ubuntu-offtopic please?
[12:53] <ValMarko> Buy Windows and there you can say fuck you very loud because you, the humanitarian, paid for it
[12:53] <arrenlex> !language | ValMarko
[12:53] <ubotu> ValMarko: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[12:53] <crowley1027> ouch...governmentally-pwnt
[12:53] <mamonassassina> Aji-Dahaka: yes,there are poor people here.
[12:53] <bruenig> brasil*
[12:53] <dredhammer> hello i succesfully compiled vlc but its missing wmv3 support did i miss something in ./configure?
[12:53] <digitalsatori> When I explore the file system using Nautilus,  it can only display the files and folders in icon view ,while shifting to list view will leave a blank window. Anybody encounter the same?
[12:54] <bruenig> dredhammer, why did you compile instead of sudo apt-get install vlc
[12:54] <jokoon> Hello, I think I need some "heavy" help [I currently thank luck for me newbie to have learn ho to edit a text file VIM in a terminal, I'm with windows now] . There was a kernel headers update, and I rebooted much later. The update replaced my menu.lst (again, without the chainloader entries to boot up windows and the K7 latest entries) but worse, the X11 or X graphical interface doesn't want to start. How can I solve it ?
[12:54] <mamonassassina> Aji-Dahaka: surely not my case though.
[12:54] <jokoon> sorry for flood
[12:54] <dredhammer> flash video
[12:54] <dredhammer> plus wmv3
[12:55] <linis_australis> greetings, Question for anyone: when I log in sometimes I am immediately logged back out. Also, when logging in on occasion I am bounced into command line login. Why is this happening?  anyone have any clues?
[12:55] <dredhammer> unless 0.8.6 is in the repos
[12:55] <mamonassassina> Aji-Dahaka: you know that an ipod here costs 3 times what an ipod costs in the Usa.
[12:55] <Aji-Dahaka> jokoon: what does it do instead of starting?  any error messages or anything?
[12:55] <mamonassassina> Aji-Dahaka: so...
[12:55] <timtrimble> trying to upgrade from breezy to edgy.  unsure entirely what to do.  can someone help?  i had to do this because gparted would crash when I would try to use the edgy livecd.
[12:55] <crowley1027> in equivalent to US dollars mamonassassina?
[12:55] <mamonassassina> still,i have some important things to do
[12:55] <tim167> what's a good way to run small windows applications on ubuntu ?
[12:55] <crowley1027> do you mean it costs 200 US here and 600 US there, or 200 US here and 600 Peso there
[12:55] <mamonassassina> tim167: wine
[12:55] <timtrimble> tim167:  wine
[12:55] <linis_australis> tim167: wine
[12:55] <Aji-Dahaka> mamonassassina: I don't doubt it.  takes about 4 hours for me to earn an ipod, though.  I imagine somewhat longer for the average brasilian to earn an ipod
[12:55] <mamonassassina> crowley1027: in equivalent to US dollars.
[12:55] <bimberi> !wine | tim167
[12:55] <ubotu> tim167: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.

[12:56] <crowley1027> tim167:wine
[12:56] <timtrimble> tim167:  apt-get install wine and then just type "wine <program name>"
[12:56] <tim167> :-D ok wine it is! is it in synaptic ?
[12:56] <mamonassassina> Aji-Dahaka: average brazilian...ya,i know some of those.
[12:56] <jokoon> Aji-Dahaka X says in some dirty text mode that some configuration files blabla with some report I can't understand. I just remember the last thing was like "no screen found"
[12:56] <timtrimble> yeah, tim167

[12:57] <Aji-Dahaka> jokoon: you may need to try reconfiguring X, I'm not sure the ubuntu-approved method, but editing the /etc/X11/xorg.conf or using xorgcfg usually work

[12:58] <mamonassassina> no,no offtopic,i guess i'm going to leave now.

[12:58] <ubotu> maddash: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[12:58] <_5-HT_> timtrimble: leap-frogging when dist-upgrading is not a good idea. Better to go Breezy -> Dapper -> Edgy to help avoid breakage. The follwing in an Edgy upgrade guide from the ubuntu wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[12:59] <Aji-Dahaka> so I installed azureus from apt, but it complains that I am running java 1.4.2 which it thinks is too old.  Is this a known problem?  is there a known remedy?
[12:59] <mamonassassina> RACIST PIG.
[12:59] <arrenlex> What the hell.
[12:59] <bruenig> Aji-Dahaka, sudo apt-get install sun-java5-bin
[01:00] <jokoon> Aji-Dahaka what kind of thing I should fix in this file ?

[01:00] <mame_runner> I was wondering if there is a faster ripper other than sound juicer
[01:00] <vanberge> could anybody help me change around my firefox plugins?  i want to use VLC and can't seem to get totem's plugin disabled
[01:00] <Aji-Dahaka> jokoon: it depends a bit on what exactly is wrong ... usually it states whether it is the video card or pointer device or whatnots
[01:01] <mame_runner> vanberge: CAn you just uninstall totem?
[01:01] <arrenlex> vanberge: apt-get remove totem-mozilla
[01:01] <timtrimble> thanks for help, all.  i'll hopefully be seeing you all in 6.10
[01:01] <vanberge> mame_runner, arrenlex when i go to mark that for uninstall it also requires taht i un mark "ubuntu-desktop" for some reason?
[01:01] <jokoon> Aji-Dahaka so actually xorgcfg is sure to fix the problem ?
[01:01] <Aji-Dahaka> jokoon: wort ha try at least
[01:02] <Aji-Dahaka> worth*
[01:02] <arrenlex> vanberge: ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage which can be safely removed.
[01:02] <arrenlex> !metapackage | vanberge
[01:02] <ubotu> vanberge: A meta-package is a package that simply depends upon other packages and brings them in. It's not a real package, but a very useful package that can drag in other package versions.
[01:02] <mame_runner> I dont think it actully uninstalls the whole desktop because I have done it for other aps.
[01:02] <jokoon> ok, thanks for te help
[01:02] <vanberge> arrenlex, ubotu  tyvm.   :-P
[01:02] <pablo___> hi, i am having problem to set up the ssid on a pcmcia
[01:02] <kbrosnan_> vanberge: type about:config in the address bar find plugin.expose_full_path and change it to true, type about:plugins in the address bar find the totem plugins, rm them, go back to about:config and change plugin.expose_full_path back to false (minor security issue leaving it true)
[01:03] <GlutenBoy> I just removed Ekiga and the "ubuntu-desktop" package and all when well phew ;)
[01:04] <ColonelZarkawi> greetings
[01:05] <pablo___> how do i setup the ssid on the network/interfaces
[01:05] <GlutenBoy> Wow cool there's a python-beagle package to do search with beagle in python code.
[01:05] <wyld> what can i do if i screwed up my sources.list?
=== kbrosnan_ is now known as kbrosnan
[01:06] <dabaR_> !easysource
[01:06] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[01:06] <maddash> pablo___: do sudo network-admin?
[01:06] <wyld> thanks
[01:06] <k13> Hi there! I have the following situation: I have a LDAP server with user authentication (running on a SuSE), each user has a printing quota. I have a printing server running in Windows with share enabled (so I see it as a Samba share in the client PCs). The client PCs runs Ubuntu. So this is what I want: configure the Ubuntu's CUPS server to access this Windows share, BUT CUPS _must_ use the current username
[01:06] <k13>  and password to access it (like smb://user:pass@printing_share_server_host) because the server decreases the user quota by the pages printed. Is there any practical way to do this by configuring Samba, or CUPS to do this without the neeeding of wrapper scripts or the like?
[01:07] <n2diy> Hello, I installed Mondo with Synaptic this afternoon, but I can't run it, it isn't in my menus, and doesn't run from a CLI?
[01:07] <orangefly> i have samba and a vpn....the vpn is connecting, but how do i access my folders on the server....???....
[01:07] <ColonelZarkawi> n2diy, error message
[01:08] <n2diy> None, I just get the command prompt again, I ran updatedb, and that didn't change anything.
[01:08] <ubun> anyone know why all my movies are playing reaaalllly slowly? i have a fast machine and they werent doing this before. i installed all the codecs and stuff and am testing with mplayer, vlc and totem
[01:08] <ColonelZarkawi> n2diy, what does strace mondo say
[01:09] <n2diy> Cololnel, I don't know, I give it a try now.
[01:09] <ubun> they wreent doing this all slow out of sync stuff the other day
[01:10] <kitche> n2diy: it's mondoarchive -Oc 2 -g to backup to a cdr
[01:10] <n2diy> Colonel, it says command not found. Synaptic shows it as installed??
[01:10] <corevette> how come when i can't uninstall xgl without getting an error?
[01:10] <kitche> n2diy: the 2 stands for the writer speed
[01:10] <ColonelZarkawi> n2diy, probably you are not giving the right parameters to mondo as kitche suggested
[01:10] <ColonelZarkawi> n2diy, and the wrong command line program
[01:10] <ColonelZarkawi> n2diy, forget about my suggestion of using strace
[01:10] <pablo___> agggggghhhhhhh why it doesnt works the wireless
[01:10] <kitche> ColonelZarkawi: :)
[01:11] <pablo___> how do i check if the pcmcia card is rightly detected
[01:12] <ColonelZarkawi> Pablo, dmesg
[01:12] <n2diy> Colonel, kitche, thanks all try mondoarchive at the prompt, and see if it gives me any suggestions.
[01:12] <Navyseal> with what program do i extract video and sound from an .avi file?
[01:12] <kitche> n2diy: mondo's website has documentation which will tell you the most common switches and how to use them
[01:12] <crowley1027> how do you remove a program?  apt-get -r program?
[01:13] <maddash> pablo___: what's the problem?
[01:13] <ColonelZarkawi> crowley1027, apt-get --purge remove package
[01:13] <tom_kelleher> is it possible to add 'open terminal here' to the menu when I right click the desktop or a folder
[01:13] <maddash> pablo___: does "sudo network-admin" work?
[01:13] <Navyseal> use the synaptic crowley1027
[01:13] <pablo___> maddash: i set up the ssid but it is not working
[01:13] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher, xfce has that option already for the xfce terminal
[01:13] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher, in thunar
[01:13] <ColonelZarkawi> !thunar
[01:13] <ubotu> thunar: File Manager for Xfce. In component main, is optional. Version 0.4.0svn+r23151-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 384 kB, installed size 2956 kB
[01:13] <maddash> pablo___: huh? define "not working." what does the network-admin command bring up?
[01:14] <crowley1027> there isn't a way to get icons on desktop?
[01:14] <crowley1027> like Gaim or ktorrent?
[01:14] <Navyseal> with what program do i extract video and sound from an .avi file?
[01:14] <bruenig> crowley1027, right click on the desktop, create launcher
[01:14] <n2diy> kitche, thanks, I DLed the docs to, but they weren't very helpful, but running mondoarchive brought me to a menu, so now I'm on the right path, tnx.
[01:14] <maddash> pablo___: "it"? how did you even set up the ssid?
[01:15] <pablo___> maddash: it brings a panel to configure the networks
[01:15] <bruenig> crowley, or generally you can drag and drop stuff, like menu items
[01:15] <nexact> hey all, I have to install a perl package, Net::RawIP.. unfortunately, I can't find it, I need help please.. Thanks !
[01:15] <pablo___> maddash: and there i set up the ssid
[01:15] <maddash> pablo___: what does "iwconfig" say?
[01:15] <kitche> Navyseal: well there is many programs to do that but usually avi is just a container the format of the video and sound can be anything
[01:15] <tom_kelleher> ColonelZarkawi; thanks, I'm installing it now.
[01:15] <ubun> what should i do if all of my movies play realllly slowly and they werent before? something i installed or configured messed things up im sure but i have no idea what
[01:15] <kitche> nexact: you have to use CPAN and it's been a while sicne I used it myself
[01:15] <Navyseal> kitche so how do i do?
[01:15] <maddash> pablo___: how many wireless interfaces do you have?
[01:15] <pablo___> maddash: 1
[01:16] <maddash> pablo___: ok, so I assume that network-admin shows that interface, right?
[01:16] <n2diy> Navyseal, www.cpan.???
[01:16] <pablo___> maddash: right
[01:16] <maddash> pablo___: is the interface enabled? properly activated (via network-admin panel)?
[01:17] <pablo___> maddash: sure
[01:17] <kitche> Navyseal: well you want to rip them from the avi file?
[01:17] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher, it's a very nice thunar feature ("Open terminal here"). It is shown in the context menu when I click with the right mouse on a directory
[01:17] <kitche> Navyseal: and not redo the video in a different format or what?
[01:17] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher, I wonder why this is not a default feauture in NAUTILUS
[01:17] <kitche> n2diy: cpan is part of perl it's how you download modules of perl and such
[01:18] <Navyseal> well i want to extract them and get to put it in avi again kitche
[01:18] <tobi> Hello back
[01:18] <pablo___> maddash: but iwconfig doesnt tell me the ssid i put
[01:18] <maddash> pablo___: ok, open up network-admin (under sudo) again,
[01:18] <dabaR_> ColonelZarkawi: it is assumed that most nautilus users do not use a terminal, and thus the feature is not enabled by default due to the gnome hig
[01:18] <tom_kelleher> ColonelZarkawi; yea, I find that feature really helpful. Even if it's really easy to cd in a terminal I'm just lazy that way
[01:18] <n2diy> kitche, I think they have a website too?
[01:18] <tobi> using irssi in a DOS like test
[01:18] <tobi> text
[01:18] <maddash> pablo___: select your interface, click "properties,"
[01:18] <nexact> maddash, thanks for the hints, cpan is simple ;D
=== family is now known as benplaut
[01:18] <dabaR_> tom_kelleher: you can install nautilus-open-terminal and get the feature
[01:18] <pablo___> maddash: right, now
[01:19] <maddash> nexact: huh?
[01:19] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher, you are right "cd ../../../" and stuff... that sucks really :)
[01:19] <tom_kelleher> dabaR_; oh really? would that be in the package manager?
=== tobi is now known as jokoon
[01:19] <nexact> maddash, err, kitche.
[01:19] <n2diy> kitche, yep, it is cpan.org
[01:19] <benplaut> is there a non-break method for backporting the newest hplip drivers to dapper? just got a new printer, and it's only in a newer version. (power user, just not familiar with debian derivs)
[01:19] <jokoon> Is the person helping me 15min ago still there ?
[01:19] <maddash> pablo___: there's a combo box thingy right next to "ESSID:"
[01:20] <dabaR_> tom_kelleher: well, or you could compile it, but that package is in ubuntu...anything you install is through a package manager...
[01:20] <benplaut> well forget that
[01:20] <dabaR_> tom_kelleher: or shortly, yes
[01:20] <maddash> pablo___: if you click it, it should display to you the SSID of detected routers
[01:20] <benplaut> they provide debs... whaddya know :P
[01:20] <pablo___> maddash: yes where i set up the ssid
[01:20] <kitche> nexact: no problem just couldn't tell you how to get it since it's been a very long time sicne I used it myself
[01:21] <tom_kelleher> dabaR_; installed it :)
[01:21] <maddash> pablo___: click the "v" (down arrow button) - does it display the ssid of your router?
=== dabaR_ is now known as dabaR
[01:21] <crowley1027> how do i install decoders for totem?

[01:21] <tom_kelleher> dabaR; should I restart X or something? I don't see the option?
[01:22] <dabaR> tom_kelleher: killall nautilus in a terminal
[01:22] <dabaR> jenda: what are you asking?
[01:22] <bimberi> hi jenda, sudo rm -r /home/jenda/.Trash/*
[01:22] <tom_kelleher> dabaR; that exactly what I type?
[01:22] <vanberge> anybody could throw me a quick command for getting rid of stupid windows files that i migrated?  like desktop.ini and thumbs.db ?
[01:22] <dabaR> tom_kelleher: killall nautilus
[01:22] <kitche> Navyseal: try Cinerella
[01:22] <pablo___> maddash: whats that exadecimal or ascii thing?
[01:23] <tom_kelleher> dabaR; AWESOME! You rock!
[01:23] <kitche> vanberge: rm -i *.ini -i makes it ask you if you want to delete before it does
[01:23] <dabaR> ;P
[01:23] <maddash> pablo___: u only use that if you use password encrypted your router/client transactions
[01:23] <tom_kelleher> ColonelZarkawi; not sure if you caught that but dabaR just showed me a package that will add the 'open in terminal' anywhere
[01:23] <vanberge> kitche, could we integrate that into a larger search?  like find "desktop.ini, thumbs.db" | rm
[01:23] <n2diy> Mondo wants to know what /dev my CDR is, is there a quick way to determine that?
[01:23] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher, I didn't get that, which is the package?
[01:23] <pablo___> maddash: well mine is not encrypted
[01:23] <maddash> pablo___: what do you mean by not broadcasting from the router?
[01:23] <wabz> hi, my sound isn't working - I'm trying to rmmod snd_intel8x0, but it tells me it's in use. How can I find out what's using it?
[01:24] <econobeing> in beryl, when i'm switching desktops, the windows move...forward, like towards the screen. how would i turn that off?
[01:24] <washbear> any OOo 2.1 .deb packages?
[01:24] <ubun> should i enable kernal frame buffer, in xerver-xorg?
[01:24] <tom_kelleher> ColonelZarkawi;  nautilus-open-terminal
[01:24] <kitche> vanberge: well you can but what's the extensitons of the files just .ini and .db?
[01:24] <jokoon> Hello, I have some problem with a Xorg not wanting to start, tried xorgcfg but there no such like comand, I still need some heavy help
[01:24] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher, hmmm nice, I will instal too, thanks dabaR !
[01:24] <pablo___> maddash: i dont let the other machines to detect it, i have to set it up, it works for the rest but ubuntu 6.10 not
[01:24] <Aji-Dahaka> bruenig: is there a way to make that the default java?
[01:24] <vanberge> kitche, just thumbs.db and desktop.ini are the only ones i am concerned about
[01:24] <zacky> hello everyone!
[01:24] <zacky> i am just wondering when i type "about:configure" in firefox's address bar, it said invalid url?
[01:25] <bruenig> Aji-Dahaka, not sure how you installed the other one. That is the only java I ever installed
[01:25] <tom_kelleher> ColonelZarkawi; just install that then restart nautilus like dabaR showed me
[01:25] <wabz> zacky: about:config
[01:25] <Aji-Dahaka> bruenig: I think it's part of the default install.
[01:25] <ColonelZarkawi> tom_kelleher,will do, thanks
[01:25] <zacky> wabz: cheers
[01:25] <bruenig> Aji-Dahaka, pretty sure it isn't
[01:25] <maddash> pablo___: does ubuntu connect when you configure your router to broadcast?
[01:26] <wabz> how do I unload a module that doesn't want to be unloaded? -f gives ERROR: Removing 'snd_intel8x0': Resource temporarily unavailable
[01:26] <kbrosnan> zacky: it is about:config
[01:26] <n2diy> Mondo wants to know what /dev my CDR is, is there a quick way to determine that?
[01:26] <kitche> vanberge: then do rm -i desktop.ini thumbs.db
[01:26] <Aji-Dahaka> bruenig: it's depended on by ubuntu-desktop so for me it installed by default.
[01:26] <dabaR> wabz: what about blacklisting it and rebootinG?
[01:26] <pablo___> maddash: dont know, that shouldnt be the problem, i configured ubuntu 6.06 in another notebook with another pcmcia without bradcasting
[01:26] <Aji-Dahaka> bruenig: does java5-bin fulfill the dependency of azureus?
[01:27] <maddash> pablo___: also, are you connected to your router via hardlink/ethernet right now? maybe there's some conflict when you try to connect via wireless as well
[01:27] <bruenig> Aji-Dahaka, yes
[01:27] <vanberge> kitche, but that wouldnt go recursively through a directory structure would it?
[01:27] <jokoon> I'm running irssi now, can someone say my nick to see if highlighting works ?
[01:27] <kitche> n2diy: look at your /etc/fstab and see what gets mounted as your cdrom drive
[01:27] <pablo___> maddash: no hard link by that machine
[01:27] <bruenig> jokoon
[01:27] <jokoon> ah thanks
[01:27] <jokoon> so I ask my question again
[01:27] <kitche> vanberge: you will have to add the -r switch
[01:27] <maddash> pablo___: have you tried using the other pcmcia w/this notebook?
[01:28] <jokoon> Hello, I have some problem with a Xorg not wanting to start, tried xorgcfg but there no such command, I still need some heavy help
[01:28] <pablo___> maddash: thats what i will try
[01:28] <n2diy> kitche, thanks, I thought there might be a way to ls it, but I'll take a look in fstab.
[01:28] <w3ccv> vanberge, man find - there is a set op flags you can do with find that will rm files - first use print if they are correct then do it with the rm flags
[01:28] <dabaR> jokoon: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is the command to config x. DO you have a graphics card like ati or nvidia?
[01:29] <Aji-Dahaka> bruenig: sho 'nuff.  thanks a lot :)
[01:29] <slop> if i have an application running that's hogging up a lot of memory, is there something i can do to keep it from bogging down my system performance so much (besides buying more memory), like making it higher priority or something?
[01:29] <jokoon> dabaR: yes of course, I ran quake 3 with ubuntu like yesterday, 125 fps in 1024*768
[01:29] <jokoon> dabaR: nvidia
[01:30] <dabaR> jokoon: so x stopped working? I don't know much about fixing that other than the nvidia wiki page...
[01:30] <ColonelZarkawi> slop, fix the application
[01:30] <Aji-Dahaka> bruenig: so you use azureus with 1.5 and it doesn't core dump for you?
[01:30] <bruenig> Aji-Dahaka, I don't use azureus. I once did, and it didn't core dump.
[01:31] <slop> ColonelZarkawi: i don't think it needs fixing....i'm kinda over-using it...
[01:31] <jokoon> dabaR: first it began with a kernel headers update, it replaced my menu.lst with an new one, and when I started it, X told me there was problems, and that he did not want to start
[01:32] <kitche> slop: what program is it?
[01:32] <slop> kitche: rTorrent
[01:32] <crowley1027> HALELUJAH
[01:32] <kitche> slop: hmm odd you must be having a lot of peers or something connected to you
[01:32] <crowley1027> i found my 256MB lexar drive.
[01:32] <crowley1027> i can play pokemon sapphire now.

[01:36] <proqesi> sorry, I couldn't remember your name and thought you might know.. :(
[01:37] <__mikem> proqesi, there is a local freenode staff member named nalioth who likes to hang around here, you can also PM him.
[01:37] <shwag> any used tripwire or something like that to watch for modifications to a machine ?
[01:37] <existence> How can I rewrite Grub to the MBR?  I reinstalled windows and it got wiped (i.e. I boot straight to windows).
[01:37] <bimberi> proqesi: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#gettinghelp
[01:38] <w3ccv> shwag, I used to use it on a Solaris machine - questions
[01:38] <nalioth> proqesi: __mikem is a helpful fellow who can answer your questions before he points folks around
[01:38] <lardarse_> does anyone know where the themes are stored for gnome ?
[01:38] <Seveas> existence, grub-install /dev/yourharddrivehere
[01:38] <nalioth> !tell lardarse_ about themes
[01:38] <n2diy> shwag, I tried in the past, with no luck, but I have tried it with synaptic.
[01:38] <__mikem> lol thanks
[01:38] <lardarse_> nalioth: ?
[01:38] <existence> Seveas, am I going to have to mount that in a live CD first?
[01:38] <Seveas> existence, no
[01:38] <nalioth> lardarse_: look to your private messages
[01:38] <n2diy> shwag, I meant to say haven't tried it with synaptic.
[01:38] <__mikem> unfortunately, I know nothing about the cloaks, except that unless freenode approves of it, you probably won't have much luck using it in these rooms
[01:39] <lardarse_> oh... damn, no sound on this computer
[01:39] <existence> Seveas, I can't get to my linux partition since I boot straight to windows..
[01:39] <proqesi> I already have a cloak, I just need it changed and lilo isn't around anymore
[01:39] <n2diy> Ok, mondo is cooking now, how do I do a restore with mondo?
[01:39] <Seveas> proqesi, ffs, stop being offtopic and follow the instructions people gave...
[01:39] <proqesi> a really popular troll has a similar name to me and I have to change my nick
[01:39] <lardarse_> nalioth: i meant where are they cutrently on my computer?
[01:39] <nalioth> lardarse_: if you read the info, you'll find out
[01:39] <shwag> n2diy: synaptic can watch my hd ?
[01:40] <n2diy> shwag, no, it can install tripwire. My past experience with tripwire wasl installing it myself.
[01:41] <tom_kelleher> I just tried to install an application but it said I couldn't install it because of a dependancies but I check in the package manager and I already have it.
[01:41] <shwag> n2diy: oh...so is tripwire the program to use though?
[01:41] <w3ccv> shwag, what's your question about tripwire
[01:41] <shwag> w3ccv: should I use it?
[01:41] <n2diy> To monitor for changed files, yes.
[01:42] <shwag> n2diy: so its like the defacto standard then ?
[01:42] <shwag> n2diy: is it easy to install on ubuntu ?
[01:42] <n2diy> Shwag, to monitor for changed files, yes.
[01:42] <shwag> n2diy: apt-get install tripwire ?
[01:42] <w3ccv> shwag, depends it does whatch the disk, but it can get wrapped up in itself - if it watches it's log files then they are always changing, configuring is time consuming, but worth it.
[01:42] <n2diy> Shwag, I have a linux security book, and tripewire is the first chapter.
[01:43] <n2diy> Shwag, I couldn't get tripwire to run, but maybe synaptic can do the job?
[01:43] <shwag> n2diy: i usually just use apt-get
[01:43] <n2diy> Schwag, apt-get install should work.
[01:44] <proqesi> Seveas: sorry, I'm just a bit distraught over the whole mess
[01:44] <w3ccv> shwag, I've had it run on Solaris and RedHat9 with no problems - right out of the box, so to speak
[01:44] <pasquale> ciao
[01:44] <n2diy> Ok, mondo is cooking now, how do I do a restore with mondo?
[01:44] <k13> where do I search the package directory like the search in packages.debian.org ?
[01:45] <ColonelZarkawi> k13, with apt-file
[01:45] <bimberi> k13: http://packages.ubuntu.com
[01:46] <ColonelZarkawi> k13, or with apt-cache searc
[01:46] <k13> colonel: i'd like to search the packages contents, and apt-file is too slow to build its cache...
[01:46] <garrettkajmowicz> Quick question:  If I want to fetch the source for a particular package I have installed on my system so that I can make modifications, what is the easiest way to do this?
[01:46] <k13> thanks, bimberi
[01:47] <n2diy> garrettkajmowicz, look for the CVS version of it?
[01:47] <bimberi> k13: np :)

[02:15] <OllieD> that's a secret
[02:16] <lumaQQ> Does anyone know whats the deal with Flash 9 in ubuntu ?  still cant get mine to work and i just found a new dead or alive vid on youtube ~~  this is mega important ~~ anyone offer any help ?
[02:16] <Jamo> like seriously how do I search for tomcat on this crap
[02:16] <LjL> !flash9 | lumaQQ
[02:16] <ubotu> lumaQQ: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[02:16] <proqesi> Jamo: you could try "locate tomcat" and see if anything comes up
[02:16] <lumaQQ> backports?
[02:16] <LjL> !backports | lumaQQ
[02:16] <ubotu> lumaQQ: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[02:16] <Jamo> thank you, that worked
[02:16] <LjL> Ubotu, tell lumaQQ about repositories | lumaQQ, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:17] <LjL> lumaQQ: you should read about how ubuntu organizes software, i think...
[02:17] <Jamo> hmm.. now I wonder how to run it :|
[02:17] <lumaQQ> LjL ?  why    ?
[02:17] <LjL> lumaQQ: because it's important to know... and if you had, you'd know what backports is :)
[02:18] <LjL> lumaQQ: software management is arguably the most important thing in a distribution, so you definitely want to understand how it's done
[02:18] <kuto> w00t
[02:19] <kuto> hi guys
[02:19] <mnoir> ok - I have my sources configured including all the source ones.  So how do I download the source for, say, bash or the 'most' utility using synaptic?  I know how to do it using apt-get.
[02:19] <LjL> lumaQQ: long story short: ubuntu (say Edgy) has an "edgy" repository, containing the (frozen, never-changing) release packages, an "edgy-updates" repository, which contains ONLY updates that fix VERY serious bugs, "edgy-security", which gives you security patches, and "edgy-backports", which can give you (if you enable it) new versions of packages that were 'backported' from the next (experimental) distribution, Feisty in this case
[02:19] <sud0> hi
[02:19] <kuto> mnoir try the search function
[02:20] <kuto> hi sud0
[02:20] <LjL> lumaQQ: each repository has a "main" (officially maintained, free packages) component, a "universe" (community maintained, free) one, "restricted" (officially maintained, non-free) and "multiverse" (community maintained, non-free)
[02:20] <funkyHat> Ok this makes no sense :/
[02:21] <kuto> funkyHat: what do you need help with
[02:21] <LjL> lumaQQ: specifically, Flash is in multiverse, and Flash 9, since it didn't exist at the time of the Edgy release, is in edgy-backports's multiverse
[02:21] <mnoir> kuto - nope, only shows the binary package
[02:21] <jvai> <--*taking notes*
[02:21] <funkyHat> If I run ./nowplaying on another machine (called mesh) it calls a program which tells me what track amaroK is playing
[02:21] <kuto> mnoir: sorry
[02:21] <funkyHat> But if I run ssh mesh './nowplaying' I get...
[02:22] <funkyHat> $ ssh matt@mesh './nowplaying'
[02:22] <funkyHat> ./nowplaying: line 1: dcop: command not found
[02:22] <LjL> lumaQQ: then there are the third-party, unsupported repositories (usually not recommended, but can be useful sometimes). you can manage (add, remove, change) repositories from the command line, or from Software Sources, and you can use apt-get (command line) or Synaptic to actually install/remove/upgrade the software

[02:29] <dabaR> funkyHat: so you are saying that package is not available?
[02:29] <brianMan> How do I stop dhclient from populating the resolv.conf?
[02:29] <kitche> jokoon: do an lsmod see if you have a nvidia kernel module
[02:30] <LjL> brianMan: i removed the 'resolvconf' package to achieve that, not sure it's a reasonable route, and ymmv. maybe you could also just set -w resolv.conf
[02:30] <jokoon> kitche : the problem is that I managed to boot at least windows, is there things I should do after doing a lsmod ?
[02:30] <funkyHat> dabaR, I have a feeling it's something to do with ssh using the local system's environment rather than the remote one's :S if I ran ssh mesh 'dcop' it returned command not found, but if I run ssh mesh '/usr/kde/3.5/bin/dcop it gives a different error (ERROR: Couldn't attach to DCOP server)
[02:31] <jokoon> kitche : before I return to the recovery mode
[02:31] <funkyHat> dabaR, should ssh use the local system's PATH? (That's what it looks like it's doing to me :S)
[02:31] <dabaR> funkyHat: ssh is a remote login, it will act as if you opened a terminal right on the computer.

[02:48] <MSTK> but will the Driver still work on Ubuntu?
[02:48] <kitche> MSTK: you will have to find the linux driver if there is one
[02:48] <MSTK> The driver was manufactured by Yamaha.  Not sure if they created a Linux one.
[02:48] <MSTK> so there's no work-around?
[02:49] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_  You there?
[02:49] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, yeah. what distribution are you on?
[02:49] <rapid_> ubuntu
[02:49] <rapid_> ?
[02:49] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ Ubuntu 6.10
[02:49] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, Check out the madwifi documentation, maybe even install it.
[02:50] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, try ifconfig ath0 up
[02:50] <MSTK> so I have to have a linux driver?  there's no workaround that allows me to use the windows driver?
[02:50] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ It says there is no such device.
[02:50] <rapid_> MSTK: ndiswrapper.
[02:51] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, ok.. you'll, compile madwifi from source and install it with your current kernel,
[02:51] <MSTK> rapid_ - thanks, I'll look into that
[02:51] <lumaQQ> Installing aMSN with an error messge... Dependency is not satisfiable  : Libc6   < whats this mean Anyone?
[02:52] <lumaQQ> Ubuntu 6.06 is called What???  ANYONE?
[02:52] <beuno> Dapper Drake
[02:52] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: How are you installing it?
[02:52] <LjL> lumaQQ: it means you try to install that using a non-Ubuntu package (or a package not for the right version of Ubuntu)
[02:53] <lumaQQ> a  i think i selected edgy but im using Dapper Drake ~~~
[02:53] <dabaR> !burn | vanberge
[02:53] <ubotu> vanberge: CD/DVD Burning software: K3b (KDE), gnomebaker, serpentine, graveman Nautilus cd burner (Gnome), gtoaster, xcdroast, cdrecord (terminal-based). Burning .iso files: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[02:53] <kitche> vanberge: well k3b is a good frontend to cdrecord
[02:54] <lumaQQ> after dapper drake  ~ what version is there?
[02:54] <vanberge> kitche, thanks...  :-)   i'd like to keep it gnome based though
[02:54] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: Edgy
[02:54] <lumaQQ> after edgy is FF right?
[02:54] <kling0n> vanberge: k2b is the best solution out there though
[02:54] <kitche> vanberge: well the only thing that is gnome based is Nautilus cd burner
[02:55] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: correct.
[02:55] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ It still doesn't recognize the card. But it installed right.
[02:55] <lumaQQ> Jordan  ~~  WHY are they making me wait sooooo long for FF~~~~  i just cant wait~~~
[02:55] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ Should I input all those commands you put up earlier?
[02:55] <vanberge> lol... ok
[02:56] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: The release cycle is every 6 months, which is actually short compared to other distibutions.
[02:56] <lumaQQ> it is   but i still have to wait ~~~
[02:56] <lumaQQ> i wish i could use the test developer V  but my ubuntu isnt that good yet
[02:56] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ I input all those commands you told me to input earlier, and it's still coming up with the same error.
[02:56] <dabaR> lumaQQ: maybe you could freeze yourself, and get unfrozen after 6 months pass...
[02:56] <lumaQQ> dabaR i was thinking about that.
[02:57] <dabaR> lumaQQ: so was cartman...
[02:57] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ you there?
[02:57] <lumaQQ> dabaR  i LOVE crtman
[02:57] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: Yoiu can dual boot dapper and Feisty.
[02:57] <lumaQQ> Jordan_U_ now?
[02:57] <NoonInSF> My g4 powerpc imac will not hibernate or suspend, any suggestions?
[02:58] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: When you install ( from the liveCD just like the first time but with the Feisty CD instead of Dapper's ) resize your Dapper partition and use the free space to install feisty
[02:58] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ Don't leave me, rapid_! :.(.....(The periods are tears)
[02:59] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, I just got back..
[02:59] <lumaQQ> Jordan_U_  sounds like a good idea but i was thinking about movig over to xubuntu ~
[02:59] <lumaQQ> what do you think Jordan_U_?
[02:59] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, type lspci | grep Atheros
[03:00] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: Sure, you can also run: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and switch between Gnome and XFCE on the same install.
[03:00] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ Then what? ath0 won't come up.
[03:01] <jvai> there's fluxbuntu also
[03:01] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, do you have a atheros based card?
[03:01] <jvai> but i dont know if fluxbuntu is active
[03:01] <lumaQQ> fkuxbuntu ?
[03:01] <Spaghetti_Knife> Yes.
[03:01] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ yes.
[03:01] <jvai> yes, i dl'ed the iso for older pc's

[03:02] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, ok, did you look at madwifi documentation
[03:02] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: At one pint I had 13 Window managers installed at once to find which I liked best :)
[03:03] <joejaxx> Jordan_U_: lol
[03:03] <lumaQQ> 13!!!!!  toooo many~
[03:03] <joejaxx> Jordan_U_: how long was your list for gsm
[03:03] <joejaxx> Jordan_U_: gdm for the sessions list
[03:03] <lumaQQ> jordan when its finished DL what do i do ?
[03:03] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ Can you give me a url?
[03:03] <joejaxx> Jordan_U_: did it take up half the screen?
[03:04] <Jordan_U_> lumaQQ: AFIK feisty comes with Beryl installed by default which should speed things up ( it wastes GPU instead of CPU ) without having to use a lightweight window manager
[03:04] <rapid_> Spaghetti_Knife, maybe madwifi.sourceforge.net or madwifi.org or similar
[03:04] <Jordan_U_> joejaxx: It scrolled :)
[03:04] <joejaxx> Jordan_U_: that is funny
[03:05] <dabaR> yay! I borked my apt system
[03:05] <joejaxx> dabaR: what is wrong with it?
[03:05] <dabaR> piece of crap. I am such a stupid...
[03:06] <dabaR> joejaxx: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36922/ shows exactly what I did...
[03:06] <Jordan_U_> dabaR: "i" == sudo apt-get install ?

[03:07] <dabaR> Jordan_U_: ya
[03:07] <dabaR> sudo aptitude install
[03:07] <maggie> hello, i looked on the forums and I can't find anyone confirming the adobe flash9 beta2 firefox lockup after closing a flash video. does anyone else have this issue?
[03:07] <dabaR> And I have no idea how to fix those errors...last time I reinstalled after a while of just manually installing packages.
[03:08] <Spaghetti_Knife> rapid_ There are a crapload of errors.
[03:09] <shwag> what user does cron usually run as ?
[03:09] <Jordan_U_> dabaR: try sudo apt-get -f install ( no package name, just leave it blank ) and sudo dpkg-reconfigure <affected packages>
[03:09] <kitche> shwag: the user that made the cronjob
[03:09] <billytwowilly> If I get an error "unkown protocol "evdev"" and I have evdev installed how would I fix this in X?
[03:10] <Jordan_U_> dabaR: Also, do you know why debootstrap was being kept back?
[03:10] <vanberge> kitche, kling0n, GnomeBaker seems pretty nice for burning...  :-)
[03:10] <joejaxx> dabaR: oh wow
[03:10] <joejaxx> dabaR: sudo dpkg --configure -a
[03:11] <dabaR> pah, it got fixed
[03:11] <Jordan_U_> dabaR: How?
[03:11] <joejaxx> dabaR: ah ok  good :)
[03:11] <jvai> vanberge, in dapper, gnomebaker has nice sounds, when finished burns errors burns, & whatnot
[03:11] <dabaR> Jordan_U_: thanks. I actually knew about that command, the -f install.

[03:13] <jokoon> aaah "startx"
[03:13] <jokoon> ok I try
[03:14] <Eclypse> that's ridiculous, edgy has already managed to successfully annoy me
[03:14] <Phelanor> Hiya everyone
[03:14] <Eclypse> in the network properties for my wireless card, I can't select my wireless router with in that
[03:14] <Eclypse> it wont let me simply ENABLE the bloody connection
[03:14] <Eclypse> so it CAN check
[03:14] <nn> Eclypse: 'man iwconfig' :)
[03:15] <Phelanor> I'm having an issue installing Edgy, I think its because I have an ATI video card
[03:15] <Eclypse> I'm taking the gui interface NN
[03:15] <nn> when GUIs annoy you, try console :)
[03:15] <Eclypse> nn, it used to just WORK
[03:15] <Eclypse> nn, now it doesnt
[03:15] <Phelanor> Hangs during installation, and theres a graphical mess below the status bar
[03:15] <nn> Eclypse: Ah. i'm in nyc, there's always 10 or 15 APs i can hop on
[03:15] <Eclypse> nn, this is retarded though, I can't enable the bloody connection within network setings
[03:15] <nn> Eclypse: so i just fire up kismet, pick out an ssid that's open, and voila! free interweb
[03:15] <Phelanor> nn: I live in Norwalk, theres six open APs, sadly they figure it out and boot me off
[03:16] <Eclypse> nn, omg, no way, it didn't prompt me for sudo,
[03:16] <nn> Phelanor: where's norwalk?
[03:16] <Eclypse> nn, did ubuntu go retarded?
[03:16] <Phelanor> In Connecticut
[03:16] <Phelanor> about an hour north via Metro North train
[03:16] <nn> Eclypse: did you enter your password for admin wrapper recently?
[03:16] <kitche> Eclypse: iwconfig can run as a user but to configure it you need sudo
[03:16] <nn> Phelanor: oh cool, wanna get drunk sometime? :P
[03:16] <Phelanor> What, no dinner?
[03:16] <Phelanor> Wheres the romance?
[03:16] <wastrel> "hello"
[03:16] <Eclypse> nn, this is a fresh install
[03:17] <Eclypse> nn, it doesn't prompt me for my password . . .

[03:17] <Eclypse> jordan_u not to my knowledge.
[03:18] <wastrel> edgy has java5
[03:18] <Eclypse> jordan_u, it's just stupid
[03:18] <wastrel> er  1.5
[03:18] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Try running: gksudo echo "test"
[03:18] <Phelanor> Maybe.
[03:18] <jokoon> kitche: when sudo modprobe nvidia, tells me "fatal: error running install command for nvidia"
[03:18] <Eclypse> just prompted me

[03:18] <Eclypse> jordan_u, it prompted.
[03:18] <genben> wastrel: according to this it is only 1.4.2
[03:18] <kitche> jokoon: then your kernel module is messed up
[03:18] <wastrel> !info sun-java5-bin
[03:18] <ubotu> sun-java5-bin: Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.5.0-08-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 21811 kB, installed size 65084 kB
[03:19] <jokoon> kitche: so I just have to update it ?
[03:19] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Then your menue item is probably just missing the gksudo, you can add it in with alacarte
[03:19] <manmadha> ok
[03:19] <kitche> jokoon: or reinstall it yes
[03:19] <Eclypse> jordan_u how?
[03:19] <genben> wastrel: the package is called sun-java5-bin ?
[03:19] <wastrel> hm but java --version does say 1.4.blagh
[03:20] <wastrel> genben:  yes
[03:20] <jokoon> kitche: so if I want a kernel for a K7 processor what component should I apt-get ?
[03:20] <jvai> ok peepz.. ty .. gn
[03:20] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: System -> Preferences -> menu layout...
[03:20] <genben> wastrel: k, thanks
[03:20] <wastrel> genben:  you may need to do  sudo update-alternatives --config java   to tell the system to use sun java instead of gjc
[03:20] <shwag> how do I change me default text editor ?
[03:20] <genben> k
[03:20] <kitche> jokoon: think the kernel for the nvidia module is the same
[03:21] <Eclypse> jordan_u then what?
[03:21] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Go to networking and add "gksudo" in front of the command, so it should read "gksudo network-admin"
[03:21] <vanberge> ok seriously does anybody else have difficulty with their internet connection??  like once or twice an hour it seems to just halt???

[03:22] <jokoon> kitche: I'm with irssi with some dos like screen, isn't there so command I should do ?
[03:22] <vanberge> Jordan_U, no... at first i thought thunderbird was causing it...   but irc etc keep running fine.
[03:22] <vanberge> its like DNS lookups bomb out
[03:22] <Spaghetti_Knife> I go to system>Administration>Network Settings, and there's the wired setting, and the modem option.
[03:22] <Spaghetti_Knife> Nothing about wireless.
[03:23] <wastrel> shwag:   sudo update-alternatives --config editor
[03:23] <kitche> jokoon: you need to switch to another terminal with alt+ctrl+F2 and  sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx might want to remove it first then install it
[03:23] <kitche> vanberge: then you probably want to turn off ipv6
[03:23] <Jordan_U> vanberge: The reason I ask is that threre is an exploit in some not up to date routers that people are using to disconnect people on IRC, see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixDCCExploit
[03:23] <Spaghetti_Knife> HELP!!!
[03:23] <Spaghetti_Knife> Is it a computer virus?
[03:23] <jokoon> kitche: I'm in a recovery mode kernel right now
[03:23] <genben> wastrel: i am getting E: Couldn't find package sun-java5-bin, after doing an apt-get update
[03:24] <Eclypse> jordan_u, this is retarded, it still isn't working

[03:24] <wastrel> !java | genben
[03:24] <ubotu> genben: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository

[03:24] <genben> ah multiverse
[03:24] <genben> yep
[03:24] <Eclypse> jordan_u, it doesn't find my wireless card, but then when I have my network monitor listening to eth1, it shows that it is connected to somethign . . .
[03:24] <kitche> vanberge: ipv6 will slow down the internet dns look ups if you don't use it
[03:24] <datsclark> Spaghetti_Knife: It's not a virus. Probably just don't have your wireless setup
[03:24] <wastrel> genben:  & prolly better to install the jre package than just the bin
[03:24] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Eth1 is likely your wireless card
[03:24] <Spaghetti_Knife> datsclark Okay, what should I do?
[03:25] <vanberge> kitche, i think that is probably right... tyvm.   Jordan_U thanks for the info about the exploit...
[03:25] <Spaghetti_Knife> datsclark: It worked until around 5:00 this evening.
[03:25] <Eclypse> jordan_u, yes, that's what I'm troubleshooting here.
[03:25] <shwag> so how do I troubleshoot a cronjob that doesnt seem to be running?
[03:26] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: It is perfectly normall for a wireless card to be called eth1
[03:26] <Eclypse> jordan_u omg, lol
[03:26] <Eclypse> jordan_u that's not what the problem is
[03:26] <tim167> question about WINE: can I run a win program that needs to be installed by running Setup.exe ? (for example powertab from www.power-tab.net)
[03:26] <wastrel> shwag:  test it on the command line first
[03:26] <Eclypse> jordan_u, it doesn't find my wireless network in network settings.
[03:26] <Spaghetti_Knife> jordan_u, yeah, I have the same problem.
[03:26] <wastrel> shwag:  and after that think about the environment variables the program needs to run, which you may need to explicitly define in the crontab
[03:27] <shwag> wastrel: good idea. thanks.
[03:28] <funkyHat> Can anyone explain this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36928/
[03:28] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Spaghetti_Knife: I may be misunderstanding your problem but "networking" ( network-admin ) does not search for wireless networks, for that you want wifi-radar or network-manager-gnome
[03:28] <funkyHat> (Messed up environment over ssh :()
[03:29] <wastrel> funkyHat:  you have a login shell in the one instance and a non-login shell in the other
[03:29] <tim167> about WINE: I tried installing powertab doing "wine Setup.exe" , but it gave a bunch of errors, ending with "failed, error 193" any ideas ?
[03:29] <jack|ass> So in edgy, "gnome-power-manager" has become somewhat retarded.  It decides the battery is "critically low" and goes to sleep as soon as i unplug the power cable.
[03:29] <jack|ass> Is there a fix for this?
[03:29] <Spaghetti_Knife> Jordan_u: I go to System>Administration>Networking, and it lists only my wired and modem connections.
[03:29] <Spaghetti_Knife> Jordan_u: I go to Wireless Assistant, and it closes automatically because it can't find any wireless components.
[03:29] <Spaghetti_Knife> Jordan_U: I think it's something with the OS.

[03:35] <funkyHat> tim167, sometimes, and quite simply... wine Setup.exe
[03:36] <lovloss> I need to know, you know, what my board's speed is and stuff. I want to go up to a pentium 4 with 3.0 ghz :D
[03:36] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: Here you go.
[03:36] <ubun> after i edit /etc/sysctl.conf what do i have to do to make the changes take effect?
[03:36] <Spaghetti_Knife> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36933/
[03:36] <lovloss> im tired of blender rendering  soooo slow
[03:36] <Pelo> lovloss,  I think you would do better to look in your board manual to see what cpu it is made to handle
[03:36] <lovloss> Pelo - ... i wasnt given a board manual. i suppose i could look it up by type. I figured it would tell me my BUS speed or something
[03:36] <tim167> funkyHat: it didn't work with powertab's Setup.exe from www.powertab.net, anything else I can try ?
[03:36] <Pelo> lovloss,  or look up your board model on line
[03:36] <Phelanor> I'm having problems installing Ubuntu because of my ATI card, how can I configure xorg to take my video card?
[03:37] <Phuzion> seems like it's seeing your card
[03:37] <lovloss> ok. Time to squat with a flashlight
[03:37] <Phuzion> I'd suggest searching on Google for "linux drivers [model number] "
[03:37] <Pelo> !ati | Phelanor
[03:37] <ubotu> Phelanor: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:37] <tim167> funkyHat: i meant www.power-tab.net
[03:37] <linax> hi
[03:38] <linax> Can anyone help me out here im relatively new to using ubuntu and im having trouble figuring some things out
[03:38] <Jordan_U> tim167: You can try installing it on windows then copying over the files / directories it creates in linux ( wine has a virtual drive C: folder in ~/.wine )
[03:38] <Pelo> linax,  just ask your question if someone can help they will try
[03:38] <Phelanor> Pelo: How would I go about doing that if this happens to me on install?
[03:38] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: What do you mean?
[03:39] <Spaghetti_Knife> It's definitely not seeing my card.
[03:39] <tim167> Jordan_U: that's what I was afraid of :-P , but I can try that, thanks
[03:39] <linax> Well for some reason i can only hear the volume in a few things Like playing a cd or in a game i play but it wont work on anything else
[03:39] <linax> it only works if i play a cd or this one specific game
[03:39] <linax> i want to hear sound in other stuff but *sigh* no such luck
[03:39] <Phuzion> Spaghetti_Knife:  Can you identify why you have a second ethernet controller that has part of the name of your wireless card in lspci then?
[03:40] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: I have no idea.
[03:40] <Jordan_U> Phelanor: You can follow the same steps to install the drivers on the liveCD, or , IMHO easier, you can install with the alternate, text based install CD.
[03:40] <Pelo> linax,  try double clicking on the sound Icon in the taskbar and see if there is anything in there you can ajdust or enable to help you out
[03:40] <tjs> are there any images of ubuntu that I could install form a 256 meg flash drive?
[03:40] <Phelanor> jordan: Thanks for the tip, alternate cd is installing now
[03:40] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: When I try to ifconfig it up, it says that there is no such device.
[03:41] <tim167> Jordan_U: maybe I can retry wine Setup.exe, but give a linux compatible path to the installer script ?
[03:41] <Phuzion> Spaghetti_Knife:  Do what I said, search for the drivers.  Your card is most likely not showing up in GUI's and ifconfig because it lacks the proper drivers
[03:41] <Phelanor> er downloading
[03:41] <Phelanor> not installing
[03:41] <genben> jrib: k, thanks for the aptitude info
[03:41] <linax> i've tried this type of stuff pelo.... the only thing down is bass
[03:41] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: It's worked until 5:00 p.m., and I just installed madwifi.
[03:41] <linax> the sound itself works but its not working with any other program at all
[03:41] <ubun> how do i make /dev/rtc readable by the user?
[03:41] <linax> just cd's and Second Life
[03:41] <Jordan_U> tim167: I am not a win / wine guy, you might get better help in #wine .
[03:41] <Pelo> linax,  try   typing alsamixer in the terminal
[03:42] <jokoon> kitche: when you told me the kernel was messed up, you meant the linux kernel or the nvidia kernel ?
[03:42] <Phuzion> Spaghetti_Knife:  I've never used madwifi, so I can't help you
[03:42] <ubun> chown u+r <user> ?
[03:42] <lovloss> :< *looking and looking* I hope it manages a 3.0 ghz... i want to process stuff fast... its brand new!
[03:42] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: :.(....
[03:42] <Jordan_U> !install | tjs
[03:42] <ubotu> tjs: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[03:42] <tim167> Jordan_U: #wine is empty :-/
[03:42] <Spaghetti_Knife> The periods are tears.
[03:42] <Phuzion> I'd suggest trying to go back to old drivers and uninstalling madwifi
[03:42] <linax> ok
[03:42] <Pelo> tim167,  it's #winehq
[03:42] <dougsko> does anyone know if there a way to manually update the output of df? its like you can delete a file, then do df, but the changes arent reflected for a few seconds
[03:42] <tim167> Pelo: ok thanks
[03:42] <tjs> Jordan_U: thanks :)
[03:42] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion I installed madwifi after the problem started.
[03:42] <linax> ok what comes up
[03:42] <kitche>  jokoon: the nvidia kernel module
[03:43] <linax> is bass pcm treble and auto gain
[03:43] <linax> playback is capture all
[03:43] <linax> USB mixer
[03:43] <Pelo> linax,   arrow right , there is more stuff
[03:43] <Phuzion> Spaghetti_Knife:  Did madwifi ever work with your wireless card?
[03:43] <Spaghetti_Knife> Yeah, it worked until this afternoon.
[03:43] <Phuzion> Ok
[03:43] <Spaghetti_Knife> I have no idea what could possibly be wrong.
[03:43] <linax> stops at auto gain
[03:44] <Phuzion> Well, I've hit a brick wall, I can't think of anything else that could be wrong
[03:44] <Pelo> linax,   you can also try searching the forum for audio issues
[03:44] <linax> i've looked sadly the only thing i can think of is that its the headphones but that doesnt really explain why it works for some stuff and not others
[03:45] <Pelo> linax,  what doesnT work again ?
[03:45] <linax> the sound isnt working outside of playing a cd or running a game called SL that i play
[03:45] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: Thanks.
[03:45] <lovloss> guys i cant figure out how to figure out what my model of motherboard is o.o  its a winfast tho
[03:45] <lovloss> how do i find out
[03:45] <Phuzion> Spaghetti_Knife:  Sorry I couldn't help you
[03:45] <Pelo> linax,  how about playing video files ?
[03:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> Phuzion: No problem.
[03:46] <linax> video files have no sound either
[03:46] <linax> =/
[03:46] <Zelda> hey everyone
[03:46] <ubun> how do i give a user read permission on a file?
[03:46] <Zelda> is there another DVD player program out there other then VLC?
[03:46] <linax> ubun right click and properties
[03:46] <ibb> xine, mplayer etc...
[03:46] <Zelda> that will play all codecs?
[03:46] <ubun> zelda mplayer... ogle i think
[03:47] <Zelda> I know VLC plays anything.
[03:47] <Pelo> linax,   double click on the sound icon in the task bar,   menu > edit > prefs ,  see what you can do with that
[03:47] <Zelda> how come that's not very popular?
[03:47] <linax> it allows the same options as the other things =./
[03:47] <linax> =/
[03:47] <Pelo> Zelda,  it's not a question of player it's a question of codex
[03:48] <kaynine> Hello all. I'm a happy Debain (sarge) user, wondering what reasons might exist for me to switch to ubuntu. Is there a list somewhere? Would you like to share your reason? Host is server, not desktop.
[03:48] <Zelda> so, which is best?
[03:48] <Pelo> linax,  you are doing something wrong becaue there is a whole lot of stuff in there
[03:48] <SurfnKid> hi i have a question about USB Drive
[03:48] <ubun> linax that only works if im the only of the file though, i need like a sudo/chown way
[03:48] <SurfnKid> when plugging it in, its read only
[03:48] <linax> bass boost
[03:48] <linax> treble
[03:48] <SurfnKid> how can that be removed... so read/write can be accessed
[03:48] <itsmabus> kaynine: if you like it, why change?
[03:48] <Pelo> ubun,  from the terminal   type   chmod --help and figure it out
[03:48] <itsmabus> :p
[03:49] <linax> pcm
[03:49] <linax> microphone
[03:49] <linax> auto gain control
[03:49] <kitche> kaynine: ubuntu is more up to date then debian and more user friendly that's wthe difference of debian and ubuntu really
[03:49] <Zelda> hey hair? which is the best all round codec player then?
[03:49] <kaynine> itsmabus: that's why I'm askin :)
[03:49] <kaynine> kitche: thank you
[03:49] <Pelo> Zelda,  congrats on the spanish but my nick is Pelo , not hair
[03:49] <Zelda> heh it means hair.
[03:49] <Bakefy> sometimes my screen saver does not work.  When it does not work its just a blank screen.  Any suggestions
[03:50] <Zelda> so, will you answer me?
[03:50] <Spaghetti_Knife> Can anybody help me get ubuntu to recognize my wireless?
[03:50] <Zelda> thanks
[03:50] <sc4ttrbrain> hi :D
[03:51] <SurfnKid> how can I remove read access from a uSB DRIVE
[03:52] <sc4ttrbrain> !nfs
[03:52] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[03:52] <Pelo> SurfnKid,   with chmod probably
[03:53] <SurfnKid> Pelo, yeah i thought so... but shouldnt a USB storage device come up as read/write for access?
[03:53] <kitche> SurfnKid: only if your root it will
[03:54] <Pelo> SurfnKid,  I don't know,  maybe it's a format problem  is it an ntfs partition ?
[03:54] <SurfnKid> kitche, ok smart man.. :) in english.. whatcha mean
[03:54] <SurfnKid> kitche, how can i root it?
[03:54] <kitche> SurfnKid: either you need to use umask to write to it as a user or use root powers
[03:54] <SurfnKid> i see
[03:55] <kitche> SurfnKid: such as sudo each time you want to do something the umask is easier when you mount it
[03:55] <kitche> anyways I'll be back later
[03:56] <SurfnKid> kitche, thx bro
[03:57] <olrrai_> hello
[03:58] <Spaghetti_Knife> Can anybody help me with the fact that my computer's not noticing my wireless capability?
[03:58] <vanberge> Spaghetti_Knife, is your card detected?
[03:58] <Spaghetti_Knife> vanberge: Nope.
[03:59] <Pelo> !wireless | Spaghetti_Knife   that's the best I can do for you
[03:59] <vanberge> and can somebody help me disable ip6?  I did what it said in the wiki but it is still enabled!!  :-(
[03:59] <ubotu> Spaghetti_Knife   that's the best I can do for you: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:59] <vanberge> Spaghetti_Knife, what kind of card?
[03:59] <Spaghetti_Knife> d-link, it's an Atheros base.
[03:59] <ColdFyre> what package provide 'smbmount'?
[03:59] <sc4ttrbrain> !ipv6
[03:59] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[04:00] <Pelo> Spaghetti_Knife,   you can also try looking up your modem model in the forum
[04:00] <vanberge> Spaghetti_Knife, you could use ndiswrapper... i've done that with unsupported cards and had success
[04:00] <ColdFyre> !smbmount
[04:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smbmount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:00] <vanberge> sc4ttrbrain, i did that and it did not disable it
[04:00] <Spaghetti_Knife> vanberge: how do I use ndiswrapper?
[04:01] <vanberge> you have to install it first...  "apt-get install ndiswrapper"  then you use ndiswarpper to import the windows drivers for your card
[04:01] <sc4ttrbrain> !samba | ColdFyre
[04:01] <ubotu> ColdFyre: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[04:02] <sc4ttrbrain> Spaghetti_Knife: try madwifi first,its alot better than nduswrapper
[04:02] <Spaghetti_Knife> sc4ttrbrain, I just installed madwifi.
[04:02] <Spaghetti_Knife> It's not working.
[04:02] <sc4ttrbrain> oh ok
[04:03] <ColdFyre> sc4ttrbrain:  ubuntu server, doesnt come with smbmount, even in the universe repositories
[04:03] <ColdFyre> the mount -t smbfs .. doesnt like me
[04:03] <sc4ttrbrain> its in samba imo,
[04:03] <sc4ttrbrain> gotta reboot,bye
[04:05] <vanberge> hmm... has anybody disabled ip6 in 6.10?
[04:05] <vanberge> i tried what it says in the wiki and its still enabled.
[04:05] <Zelda> why do you want to disable it?
[04:06] <vanberge> Zelda, because its making my internet connection slow
[04:06] <Zelda> oh just wondering.
[04:06] <cafuego_> vanberge: Not, it's not. it's making dns lookups slow because it tries AAAA entries first.
[04:06] <existance> how do I figure out what drivers I need for my microphone?
[04:07] <vanberge> cafuego, well thank you.... but that does also = slow internet browsing.
[04:07] <cafuego_> vanberge: Slow lookups yes, but it doesn't affect data transfer speeds at all.
[04:07] <cafuego_> vanberge: Did you search for 'v6' in the firefox about:config ?
[04:08] <vanberge> yes that part is already disabled / false
[04:08] <cafuego_> Um,
[04:08] <cafuego_> network.dns.disableIPv6 should be TRUE
[04:08] <vanberge> but when i do the ip a | grep inet6 i still get output
[04:08] <cafuego_> vanberge: Yes, whether the ipv6 kernel module is loaded bears no relation to whether firefox uses it or not
[04:09] <bobbie__4> Hey ReDnEcKbOy you found the right server
[04:09] <vanberge> cafuego, well i'd like to disable it across the board as it affects email, irc, etc.
[04:09] <vanberge> firefox is actually working well
[04:09] <cafuego_> vanberge: it just has ipv6 entries for localhost and somesuch on the interface; that's fine - they don't interfere at all
[04:10] <ReDnEcKbOy> I already knew what server to use... I just didn't check what I was connecting to 'cause I didn't remember changing the server in the connection tool :P
[04:10] <ReDnEcKbOy> but thnx anyways bobbie__4
[04:10] <vanberge> cafuego_, the wiki says that you shouldnt get any output when doing the grep.  so, i guess i'm trying to understand why what i did has not disabled the kernel module?
[04:11] <cafuego_> vanberge: You blacklisted the ipv6 module?
[04:11] <cafuego_> vanberge: ... and then rebooted?
[04:12] <vanberge> cafuego_, i did the first three steps and then rebooted.  the blacklist part says 'for dapper'
[04:12] <Zemmy> hello
[04:12] <jesse`> Hey ho.  What's with the weird characters in Ubuntu man pages?
[04:12] <jesse`> They don't show up properly in, say, emacs or eterms.
[04:13] <jesse`> But they look peachy in xterms.
[04:13] <Zemmy> how do I install a .pl file?
[04:13] <jesse`> .pl is a perl file.
[04:14] <jesse`> You put it somewhere in your path and run it.
[04:14] <ReDnEcKbOy> alright! I hope someone can help me out... i'm still a newbie with Linux... Ubuntu 6.10 is my starting point... and i found out some cool info for setting up multi-track recording on it (which is the LAST step I need to take before getting rid of Microsomething for ever)... now I did everything I could, following the steps in the community stuff... and I can't seem to make my jack audio server run right... then I also wanted to
[04:14] <ReDnEcKbOy> setup timidity and that doesn't seem to work well either... is there anyone here who can help? I'm an amateur musician and I just really wanna get my demo out there but I wanna do it on my own but I have no money left to invest... And I really think the 'Open Source' could give me a hand ;)
[04:14] <jesse`> You might have to make it executable (chmod +x filename)
[04:15] <gentoo_helper> Hello there, can anyone help me do a dual boot with OpenSuSE? I installed SuSE first with its own /boot on /dev/sda1 (marked bootable) and it seems that in doing so I have made things hard for myself. How can I work ubuntu onto the spare space on the disk without reinstalling grub and without damaging my existing /boot?
[04:16] <Zemmy> I just get a "command not found" response
[04:16] <ubun> how come 'sudo chown o+r bla' says '"o+r": invalid user'
[04:17] <bimberi> Zemmy: try:  ./file.pl
[04:17] <SpacePuppy> gentoo_helper: just do a custom install and it should be obvious as what to do. You will prolly have to tweak grub.. so
[04:17] <gentoo_helper> SpacePuppy, Ok. How do I do a custom install? I'm not very comfortable with this debian style install process because I am used to Gentoo. :)
[04:17] <Flannel> gentoo_helper: "Expert" Install mode on the Alternate CD, will give you an option for lilo, grub, or none.
[04:18] <gentoo_helper> Flannel, ....alternate CD?
[04:18] <SpacePuppy> gentoo_helper: just do it.
[04:18] <gentoo_helper> Flannel, I take it this is not the Ubuntu 6.10 LiveCD
[04:18] <Zemmy> bimberi- its working thanks
[04:18] <Flannel> gentoo_helper: yes.  Alternate CD.  LiveCD is desktop CD.  This is just a text-based, debian-installerish installation CD
[04:18] <SpacePuppy> gentoo_helper: asking too many questions will just confuse you.
[04:18] <gentoo_helper> SpacePuppy, Is there an "expert mode" available on the regular old LiveCD?
[04:19] <SpacePuppy> i don't know .. boot it up and find out.
[04:19] <gentoo_helper> SpacePuppy, In the gentoo universe, asking a ridiculous number of questions is a requirement. :-D
[04:19] <malt> has anyone ever set up psychostats gaming stats for Counter-strike 1.6 on ubuntu?
[04:19] <gentoo_helper> Flannel, Ok. So on the LiveCD I can't tell it not to install Grub?
[04:19] <Flannel> gentoo_helper: I have no idea.  I haven't used the DesktopCD since... well... ever.
[04:20] <SpacePuppy> gentoo_helper: lol.. i guess i'm from the slackware model where if you dont rtfm at least twice before asking then no-one will answer you.
[04:20] <gentoo_helper> SpacePuppy, Ah. I've never used slackware. Only have one x86 machine. Has slackware ever been run on amd64?
[04:20] <Bakefy> anyone know why my screen saver is blank?
[04:20] <SpacePuppy> gentoo_helper: yes you can can tell it to install grub/lilo or nothing.. just doo it... and i don't know about slackware since about 4.3
[04:21] <Pelo> Bakefy,  becaue it is set to blank ?  or random and blank is up ?
[04:21] <gentoo_helper> SpacePuppy, On the LiveCD though, right? Like I said?
[04:21] <SpacePuppy> fire it up and go for it!! woooot!!!
[04:22] <Bakefy> Pelo, its on pictures, and it only works 5 % of the time
[04:22] <gentoo_helper> Flannel, If I have Ubuntu in a partition, /dev/sda4 and a /boot inside of / on that partition, then I can point my menu.lst entry for SuSE to that by giving the kernel line something like (hd0,3)/boot/whatever, right?
[04:22] <Flannel> gentoo_helper: yeah.  It's just normal grub stuff ;)
[04:22] <SpacePuppy> gentoo_helper: or you can mount that hdo,3 frominside ubuntu and then copy those lines into grub.
[04:23] <gentoo_helper> Flannel, Oh good. That I can understand. :)
[04:23] <gentoo_helper> SpacePuppy, There's a thought. I'd still need to edit 'em though.
[04:23] <what_if> does anyone here have sound working on YouTube ? if so .. how ?
[04:23] <SpacePuppy> a little vi and it's all done
[04:24] <gentoo_helper> SpacePuppy, Is it possible to append expert to the boot options on the LiveCD to get to a text based install? I have no working CD burner with which to get the "alternate" .iso at the moment.
[04:24] <vanberge> cafuego, i had to do the dapper part as well, it appears.   the kernel module is not loaded any longer.  thanks for helping me  :-)
[04:24] <SpacePuppy> what_if: no probs here// does your sound work normally?
[04:24] <devin_> i'm trying to make a partition for one of my drives does this look bout right for fdisk.  mkfs -t ext3 /dev/hdb1
[04:24] <what_if> SpacePuppy: yes, everything buy youtube works
[04:25] <what_if> SpacePuppy: so... this is not a common problem?
[04:25] <draeath> help! gpg is timing out consistantly on keyservers, no matter what keyserver I try! wireshark shows some (not much) bi-directonal traffic

[04:26] <Phuzion> Anyone here have any good recommendations for a usenet binary downloader?
[04:27] <Phuzion> And preferably do not say Pan because I can't figure out why its not working
[04:27] <Flannel> gentoo_helper: no.  The textmode (alternate) CD is an entirely different method than the Desktop CD one
[04:27] <Pelo> fabriciocscte,  jo no esta espanol, jo soy canadian
[04:27] <what_if> SpacePuppy: tried that url, no sound
[04:27] <Pelo> e jo no parla mui espanol
[04:28] <what_if> SpacePuppy: i am using flash 7 and have 2 soundcards (which may be the problem)
[04:28] <gentoo_helper> Flannel, Ok then. Guess I have no choice but to get that image and burn it. Looks like I'll have to scrounge something. :-/
[04:28] <SpacePuppy> what_if:  is the sound slider up?
[04:28] <what_if> SpacePuppy: yes :)
[04:28] <gentoo_helper> Flannel, SpacePuppy, thanks for your help guys. I'll give the install a shot from the alternate CD as soon as I can find a working burner.
[04:28] <Flannel> gentoo_helper: eh.  not necessarily.
[04:28] <Flannel> !install | gentoo_helper, there's plenty of methods, see if you can find one that works (netboot, etc, etc)
[04:28] <ubotu> gentoo_helper, there's plenty of methods, see if you can find one that works (netboot, etc, etc): Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways.

[04:29] <SpacePuppy> what_if: only thing i can  suggest is that your flash install is foo_bar
[04:30] <Madpilot> gyaresu, most of it is the !restricted stuff, plus a few extras like Opera
[04:30] <gyaresu> tonyyarusso: thanks.
[04:30] <tonyyarusso> gyaresu: Also, !binarydriver
[04:30] <what_if> SpacePuppy: yeah, just tried illwillpress (foamy) and no sound there either... will reinstall flash
[04:31] <nn> <3 foamy
[04:31] <SpacePuppy> what_if:  :D
[04:32] <SpacePuppy> what_if: yup foamy works here
[04:33] <malt> has anyone ever set up psychostats gaming stats for Counter-strike 1.6 on ubuntu?
[04:36] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I force FrostWire to quit?
[04:36] <mark_> sudo pkill -9 FrostWire
[04:36] <Pelo> Spaghetti_Knife,  rightclick the icon
[04:37] <project_2501> does anyone have a problem with mounting cds/dvds and ubuntu list files on the cd as a bunch of random question marks?
[04:37] <Zakir> killall process_name... kill -9 might be a little extreme. :-)
[04:37] <Spaghetti_Knife> Umm, it's not working.
[04:37] <Spaghetti_Knife> What do I type?
[04:38] <Zakir> if you are using kill, you have to specify the process ID... if you are using killall, use the process-name
[04:38] <Spaghetti_Knife> FrostWire isn't quitting.
[04:38] <Spaghetti_Knife> So what exactly do I type?
[04:38] <Music_Shuffle> Spaghetti_Knife, you can just type in xkill and then click....if you prefer that. >.>
[04:38] <Zakir> To find the process name and ID, you can run "ps -ef" in the terminal.
[04:38] <Spaghetti_Knife> It's not working.
[04:39] <Zakir> spaghetti_knife... what's not working? what are you trying?
[04:39] <Spaghetti_Knife> xkill.
[04:39] <Spaghetti_Knife> I click on FrostWire, and it doesn't close.
[04:40] <ReDnEcKbOy> alright! I hope someone can help me out... i'm still a newbie with Linux... Ubuntu 6.10 is my starting point... and i found out some cool info for setting up multi-track recording on it (which is the LAST step I need to take before getting rid of Microsomething for ever)... now I did everything I could, following the steps in the community stuff... and I can't seem to make my jack audio server run right... then I also wanted to
[04:40] <ReDnEcKbOy> setup timidity and that doesn't seem to work well either... is there anyone here who can help? I'm an amateur musician and I just really wanna get my demo out there but I wanna do it on my own but I have no money left to invest... And I really think the 'Open Source' could give me a hand ;)
[04:40] <Spaghetti_Knife> Okay, it worked.
[04:40] <Spaghetti_Knife> Thanks!!!
[04:42] <nn> ReDnEcKbOy: timidity is a player, check out rose garden and audacity
[04:42] <mark_> ifconfig
[04:42] <mark_> Er..
[04:42] <mark_> Oops.
[04:42] <ReDnEcKbOy> I know... but I tried to Use timidity as my SERVER
[04:43] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: server for what?
[04:44] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: there's something I just googled up, http://jackaudio.org/
[04:44] <ReDnEcKbOy> server for playing back Midi since my soundcard doesn'T support it Hardware I have to install software support for midi
[04:46] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: well I don't know anything about music making, but that jackaudio.org looked like something you need
[04:46] <ReDnEcKbOy> OMG!!! Now with experimental MIDI support!
[04:46] <ReDnEcKbOy> that's not with the Jack I got in the Ubuntu reps =)
[04:46] <ReDnEcKbOy> thanks
[04:47] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: http://jackaudio.org/applications there's nice list of everything
[04:47] <zoidberg> does anyone know how to install a N64 emulator...i cant get Mupen64 to install?
[04:48] <what_if> does anyone know how to troubleshoot or setup flash? I have no sound, have reinstalled flash and tried different browsers
[04:48] <charlie5> hi ... is it ok to ask for laptop/notebook buying advice ?
[04:48] <ReDnEcKbOy> diskus, thanks I really appreciate it... i'm gonna try everthing i can find there ;)
[04:48] <Toma-> zoidberg, dont you just untar it and run it?
[04:48] <zoidberg> how do u untar Toma-
[04:49] <Toma-> tar -zxf filename.tar.gz
[04:49] <diskus> charlie5: I have HP pavilion and it works fine
[04:49] <ReDnEcKbOy> <charlie5> charlie5, just be careful if you buy a laptop with an ATI Radeon Xpress 200M... I never got anything to work in 3D 'cause the driver doesn't support it...
[04:49] <Toma-> zoidberg, better yet, right click and "Extract here"
[04:49] <diskus> charlie5: http://www.linux-laptop.net/
[04:49] <olrrai_> later
[04:49] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: I got
[04:50] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: tremulous and some other 3d games work fine
[04:50] <ProFfX> hey
[04:50] <Toma-> theres also an ubuntu laptop page in the wiki somewhere
[04:50] <what_if> charlie5: i'd stay away from ati completely (in my experience) and I've had good luck with compaq laptops (on my third)
[04:50] <ReDnEcKbOy> diskus... how about the rest? what do you get as framerate with the glide gears?
[04:50] <ProFfX> I cant change my keyboard layout to Swedish
[04:50] <ProFfX> I tryed kbdconfig but its still Spanish layout :S
[04:50] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: well have to turn on laptop and check :P
[04:51] <Spaghetti_Knife> Anyone use FrostWire?
[04:51] <ProFfX> Spaghetti_Knife, didnt get it to start :S
[04:51] <ProFfX> so I started to us xMule :)
[04:51] <ProFfX> works nice
[04:51] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: ofcourse ati express 200M is not rocket, so I didn't even expect anything big :P
[04:51] <cafuego_> charlie5: if you're not too worried about extremely high 3d framerates, intel based laptops should be shiny. The 945 are supported and the X3000 as well these days I think.
[04:51] <charlie5> thanks guys ... i have 0 laptop experience ... i was hopring for something with a nvidia card, as i'm used to these
[04:51] <ProFfX> anyway someone knows how I can change my kaybord layout?
[04:51] <Phelanor> how can one boot up into command prompt?
[04:51] <spx2> can i be unbanned from #vim ?
[04:52] <spx2> i really need help from over there
[04:52] <spx2> does someone know anyone there ?
[04:52] <ProFfX> spx2, with what?
[04:52] <tonyyarusso> spx2: ...that's entirely not our call - check chanserv for the contact if you need to
[04:52] <ReDnEcKbOy> well using microsomething windsomething i've been able to run great games like The latest tony hawk (before project8)
[04:52] <ReDnEcKbOy> and now in linux I can't even run Xmoto
[04:52] <charlie5> ReDnEcKbOy: yep, i've head the ati are not well supported in linux
[04:52] <spx2> ReDnEcKbOy: whats that again ?
[04:53] <charlie5> diskus: thanks for the site ... hadn;t seen it yet
[04:53] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: hmm.. you meant glxgears?
[04:53] <spx2> charlie5: i have ati 200m
[04:53] <cafuego_> charlie5: nvidia *should* work fine, but then, I've never used one of their laptop based gfx controllers
[04:53] <Phelanor> I'm having trouble installing ubuntu with my ATI card
[04:53] <shayan_> Does anyone know of some instant messaging bugs, harmless pranks that i can use with my freinds?
[04:53] <Phelanor> i installed successfully with the alternate cd and the text based installer
[04:53] <Phelanor> but upon boot i still get the same graphical glitch
[04:53] <charlie5> spx2: are i may have been misinformed :/
[04:54] <Phelanor> how can i boot into the command prompt so I can install proper ATI drivers?
[04:54] <ReDnEcKbOy> yeah sorry glxgears...
[04:54] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: it doesn't show fps, but runs fine, no glitches at all
[04:54] <cafuego_> charlie5: The thing is, not all mobile radeons are supported by the ATI driver, and ati's own driver is not a shining examply of stability.
[04:55] <zoidberg> do you guys know what it means when it says "GLX" missing on display 0:0
[04:55] <jackfrost> hello
[04:55] <Zakir> _charlie5: nvidia has worked great on several laptops I've used... but I honestly have never been able to get the ATI drivers to work... as well, the nvidia card allows you to easily use multiple screens.
[04:55] <charlie5> cafuego_: thanks ... i'll probably try to find one with a nividia card ... i use these in my desktop, and do a bit of 3d dev work, so it would be handy to have good 3d accel
[04:56] <ReDnEcKbOy> anyways I have no money to buy a new laptop so i'll just forget about it and just keep on suffering from the pain of not beeing able to play games :(
[04:56] <kitche> zoidberg: you don't have the glx module enabled in your xorg.conf
[04:56] <charlie5> Zakir: yep, i pretty well sold on a nvidia
[04:56] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: well I presume you did try ATI's closed source drivers?
[04:56] <Zakir> Phelanor: you should be able to hit ctrl-alt-f1 after bootup.. to access the CLI.
[04:57] <cafuego_> charlie5: *nod* My next one will be an intel (just recently bought an desktop mobo with integrated i945, which seems fine) - but I don't do gaming.
[04:57] <zoidberg> kitche: how do i enable it...i know that this has been giving me a problem...before i used to be able to run blender3d but now i cant because of this same reason...
[04:57] <ReDnEcKbOy> <diskus> closed source?
[04:58] <diskus> ReDnEcKbOy: the ones you get from ati.com
[04:58] <ReDnEcKbOy> yes yes indeed I did
[04:58] <diskus> well works fine here
[04:58] <diskus> maybe slower ofcourse, because it's ati :P
[04:58] <diskus> slower than in Windows I mean
[04:58] <kitche> zoidberg you can do it this way sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and when you get to the module part make sure glx has a * in the [] 
[04:58] <spx2> is it normal that my computer stays less than one hour awake with its battery beeing full on start,just running basic stuff like ubuntu+gvim+firefox ?
[04:59] <ReDnEcKbOy> spx2, is it lasting longer in other os's like microsomething windsomething?
[05:00] <spx2> ReDnEcKbOy: i havent tried except for ubuntu
[05:00] <spx2> kitche: what do you think ?
[05:00] <spx2> diskus ?
[05:00] <FFForever> i have ubuntu & kubuntu and i was wondering how i re enable gdm i don't like kdm but i figured id give it a shot
[05:00] <diskus> I don't know, never used my laptop without AC plugged in
[05:00] <ReDnEcKbOy> OMG!!!
[05:00] <ReDnEcKbOy> lol
[05:00] <ReDnEcKbOy> you're killing the battery
[05:00] <diskus> batter is removed :P
[05:01] <kitche> spx2: soudns like your battery is draning to fast
[05:01] <jackfrost> pwned.
[05:01] <diskus> battery even
[05:01] <ReDnEcKbOy> diskus ok you scared me :P
[05:01] <yakumo> hi what is the different with Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-generic and Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-386???
[05:01] <spx2> ReDnEcKbOy: why do you think one is killing the battery that way ?
[05:02] <jackfrost> spx2 do a search on lithium ion battery maintence
[05:02] <diskus> and I think there must be somekind protection in laptops now, to prevent that
[05:02] <ReDnEcKbOy> spx2, if you never uncharge the battery... all the liquid hardens and then you never can recharge is enough...
[05:02] <spx2> ReDnEcKbOy: i got the laptop some months ago and im using it with the batter on and ac plugged in
[05:02] <FFForever> how do i enable the gdm?
[05:02] <gyaresu> Best GUI network manager? Suggestions?
[05:02] <Pelo> yakumo,  the generic package is just a dummy that load the correct one for your system,  to avoid screwups
[05:02] <Zakir> network-manager-gnome
[05:02] <gyaresu> Zakir: thanks
[05:03] <zoidberg> kitche: i just ran what you told me too...and GLX already had a * beside it
[05:03] <ReDnEcKbOy> spx2, there might be a way to make it come back a little faster... that would be to recharge it and bring it to complete death before recharging it again... and do this over and over again for a few dozen times...
[05:03] <zoidberg> kitche: should i try my program again or do i need to restart my computer?
[05:03] <spx2> ReDnEcKbOy: ill try that
[05:03] <FSRxc> Good evening
[05:03] <kitche> zoidberg: just have to restart X if you went though the whole thing with ctrl+alt+backspace
[05:04] <FSRxc> What would you guys suggest as far as eye candy goes? aiglx, beryl, or compiz xgl?
[05:04] <kitche> FSRxc: depends on card
[05:04] <FSRxc> nvidia FX 5700LE
[05:04] <kitche> FSRxc: I would just use the nvidia driver
[05:04] <FSRxc> Decent 256 mb card, I'd guess
[05:04] <ReDnEcKbOy> I for myself have a fairly new laptop.. had it for a year and I wait for the battery to die Everyday before I go to bed and plug it back in... I maybe lost half an hour of power after a Year of usage
[05:04] <Zakir> FRSxc: beryl or compiz will run on aiglx or xgl... beryl split from compiz and is the OSS optino.
[05:05] <kitche> !nvidia9|FSRxc
[05:05] <ubotu> FSRxc: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using this repository: deb http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/ubuntu edgy stable
[05:05] <yakumo> the problem is i  upgrade using the auto update and when i restart, my grub list add other menu Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-386. when i choose it error 15: file not found... any idea why? :)
[05:05] <FSRxc> I'm on dapper
[05:05] <yakumo> <Pelo>the problem is i  upgrade using the auto update and when i restart, my grub list add other menu Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-386. when i choose it error 15: file not found... any idea why? :)
[05:06] <sphorbis> i
[05:06] <Pelo> yakumo,  no,sorry,  , you can always edit grub not to have the option
[05:06] <sphorbis> i'm doing a fresh install of edgy and i keep getting x server failures
[05:06] <FSRxc> Last time I installed xgl/compiz via the ubuntu guide
[05:07] <FSRxc> Various errors came up
[05:07] <kitche> sphorbis: do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and reconfigure X fixes my problem
[05:07] <FSRxc> To the point where it eventually caused X to not start.
[05:07] <sphorbis> thx kitche
[05:07] <FloK> hi. how can i disable tooltips in gnome pls?
[05:07] <Zakir> FSRxc I remember that there were a couple of issues when they made some larger changes to the compiz structure and the wiki wasn't fixed for a little while.
[05:07] <yakumo> yes thnks anyway, i edited my grub list
[05:08] <FSRxc> I see
[05:08] <FSRxc> Basically, my goal is to make a vista-like interface :-|
[05:08] <what_if> i have no sound in flashplayer... can someone help ??
[05:08] <ReDnEcKbOy> <FSRxc> what's the point of making something ulgy out of beautiful?
[05:08] <FSRxc> lmao
[05:08] <FSRxc> I just want to tease some friends
[05:09] <sc4ttrbrain> FSRxc: :have u tried beryl?
[05:09] <FSRxc> "Not that you would, but you could" sorta thing
[05:09] <FSRxc> Nope.
[05:09] <FSRxc> Is there a site or guide?
[05:09] <Zakir> FSRxc: I'd go with beryl... since that's a continuation of compiz that has the most development.... However, I can't give you advice on XGL vs AIGL... when I ran XGL... it was pretty unstable for me... so personally, if I tried again, I'd use AIGL.
[05:09] <ReDnEcKbOy> <FSRxc> time - money and you're wasting it... congrats
[05:09] <sc4ttrbrain> try it, its easy to clone vista, mac ,anything :D
[05:10] <sc4ttrbrain> anyway ,im using aiglx
[05:10] <spx2> i have ati radeon 200m , i get only 60hz on my display,i don't know my sync rates,what do i do ? i tried searching for them got nothing. :(
[05:10] <FSRxc> Cool, and yeah, I had a friend recommnd aiglx to me
[05:10] <FSRxc> redneckboy, I'm not wasting any money
[05:10] <spx2> HEEELP
[05:10] <ReDnEcKbOy> FSRxc, no but time
[05:10] <FSRxc> Fair enough
[05:10] <spx2> i have ati radeon 200m , i get only 60hz on my display,i don't know my  sync rates,what do i do ? i tried searching for them got nothing. :(
[05:10] <spx2> HEELP
[05:11] <sc4ttrbrain> ReDnEcKbOy: :to convert ppl to ubuntu, all what it takes, i will :D
[05:11] <ReDnEcKbOy> spx2 I know there's a way to get the framerate with glxgears but i don't know the commands... try glxgears --help
[05:11] <Zakir> FSRxc: I disagree with redneckboy... I have some coworkers who believe that when used correctly, beryl actually makes them more productive for features such as switching windows... transparency... the window sorting, etc.
[05:11] <spx2> ReDnEcKbOy: not the framerate,the vertical and horizontal syncs !
[05:11] <ReDnEcKbOy> Zakir... i'm okay with the optimization process... but making it look like windows... isn't it odd?
[05:12] <spx2> HOW DO I GET MY MONITOR MORE THAN 60HZ ?
[05:12] <sc4ttrbrain> convert ppl dude
[05:12] <FSRxc> Yup
[05:12] <FSRxc> I know some people that are wanting to try linux
[05:12] <FSRxc> But... they're still pawns to the window
[05:12] <ReDnEcKbOy> spx2, I have an ATI 200M too and never got sweet fudge all to work... ati drivers = crap
[05:12] <FSRxc> So if I could lead the way
[05:12] <FSRxc> And show them that they don't need a monster of a computer, all is well :)
[05:13] <sc4ttrbrain> ati radeon 9000 works like CHARM !
[05:13] <Zakir> FSRxc: yeah, it'll take you some time. :-) It won't work the first time... but by the time your done... you'll know your xorg.conf a whole lot better! :-) REDNECKBOY... I agree that I wouldn't make it look like windows... but I personally was ready to be done with windows forever... some people aren't... little by little... if the eye candy moves them over (even it looks like Vista), then I'm all for it!
[05:13] <spx2> ReDnEcKbOy: I JUST NEED TO GET A DECENT REFRESH RATE 60HZ IS BURNING MY EYES REALLY!
[05:13] <ReDnEcKbOy> FSRxc, someone already tried and called it lindows, got sued by microsoft and called it linspire... it never worked
[05:13] <VerdRousseau> can anyone here help me get my Dell truemobile working with ndiswrapper
[05:13] <kitche> spx2: go here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto#head-42bafbcee7a10ed50f2d9016555557b9874be252
[05:13] <FSRxc> I'm fairly familiar with my xorg.conf, lol
[05:13] <spx2> thx kitche
[05:14] <FSRxc> Hey... I have linspire
[05:14] <FSRxc> Somewhere...
[05:14] <spx2> kitche: i have LCD no CRT
[05:14] <ReDnEcKbOy> Linspire though was a scam... you had to pay for the 'click and run' which is exactly the same thing as the synaptics...
[05:14] <FSRxc> Yup
[05:14] <FSRxc> I didn't buy linspire
[05:14] <Zakir> FSRxc: setting up compiz was my first major "project" on linux... I bugged the heck out of the unix sysadmin... breaking X over and over again... but eventually figured it out. :-0
[05:15] <FSRxc> They had a short period where they gave that out for free
[05:15] <sc4ttrbrain> !offtopic :D
[05:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about offtopic :D - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:15] <ReDnEcKbOy> I installed it once and got rid of it the next day lol
[05:15] <kitche> spx2: ok see if these commands will return anything to you sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange
[05:15] <FSRxc> I never even installed it, HA!
[05:15] <FSRxc> ;)
[05:15] <FSRxc> Zakir, how many times did you break linux with compiz?
[05:15] <AngryElf> given that /etc/X11/xorg.conf doesn't exist AND xorg.conf.bak does -- why does "sudo sed 's/nv/nvidia/g' xorg.conf.bak > xorg.conf" give xorg.conf: Permission denied???
[05:16] <spx2> kitche: hang on
[05:16] <spx2> AngryElf: get root!
[05:16] <Gilbert_4321> if i install ubuntu on my windows xp labtop do i lose my xp os or do i ceep it and get #ubuntu also?
[05:16] <Gilbert_4321> i mean ubuntu lol
[05:17] <spx2> kitche: root@spx2-laptop:/home/spx2/eckel/scopeoperator# ddcprobe | grep monitorrange
[05:17] <spx2> root@spx2-laptop:/home/spx2/eckel/scopeoperator#
[05:17] <kitche> Gilbert_4321: if you don't delete your partition
[05:17] <kitche> spx2: sudo
[05:17] <Zakir> FSRxc: I never "broke" linux too badly.... just made some big enough errors in xorg.conf setting up both dual-monitors, compiz, and XGL, that I had to go beg for help... at the point where I just followed howtos and didn't really understand what the steps actually did... :-)
[05:17] <spx2> kitche: already root
[05:17] <kitche> spx2: ah ok didn't see it :)
[05:17] <FSRxc> Ah
[05:17] <FSRxc> I made big errors
[05:17] <Gilbert_4321> will it delete my current OS or will it ask me during installing?
[05:17] <FSRxc> Tried to backtrack, and it broke things
[05:17] <spx2> kitche: what do i do ?
[05:18] <Gilbert_4321> will it ask or does it do it automaticly if i dont do anything i mean
[05:18] <Zakir> FSRxc... that's essentially what I did... I kept trying to fix it... but just continued to break it even more to the point where X was nowhere close to functional.
[05:18] <ReDnEcKbOy> Gilbert it'll ask... but you gotta be careful with the partitioning
[05:18] <sc4ttrbrain> Gilbert_4321: :it ll ask u :D
[05:18] <bimberi> AngryElf: the redirect doesn't get run as root with that syntax.  Run it in a root shell (sudo -i).
[05:18] <Gilbert_4321> kk ty
[05:18] <FSRxc> Zakir, did you reinstall?
[05:18] <kitche> spx2: there is another way to do it also by running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg make sure you backup the xorg.conf before you do that command to be on the safe side
[05:19] <Gilbert_4321> im still d loading it so i cant install yet lol
[05:19] <Gilbert_4321> ty for your help
[05:19] <FSRxc> Better yet, is there anything in linux like system restore?
[05:19] <spx2> kitche: that won't work either i tried that already
[05:19] <kitche> spx2: you still have the monitor book :)
[05:20] <Zakir> FSRxc... didn't end up needing to in the end...luckily my friend knew what he was doing and could essentially write the xorg and gdm conf files again off the top of his head.
[05:20] <spx2> kitche: no i dont
[05:20] <Vich> anyone here use effectv?

[05:34] <Mahdi> hi, could anybody plz help me with smth? i got a ext3 partition that i want all users to have rw access. My /etc/fstab is "/dev/hda2 /stuff       ext3    defaults,users        0       2", but only root can write there... what is wrong?
[05:34] <PhibreOptix> So, does anybody here know why my Ubuntu keeps freezing when I leave it idle over night?
[05:35] <craigbass1976> What went wrong today?  I couldn't get dansguardian working.  I think it was as problem with squid, not sure.  I ended up puttin ubuntu ce on my kid's box because it's all preconfigured
[05:35] <Mahdi> PhibreOptix: overheating? buggy video drivers?
[05:35] <PhibreOptix> Mahdi: not sure, but try giving it rw access to everybody chmod +rw
[05:35] <PhibreOptix> Nah it's not overheating, and the video drivers are fine
[05:35] <craigbass1976> PhibreOptix, Are you here in Maine with me?
[05:35] <craigbass1976> Stuff freezes here all the time...
[05:35] <PhibreOptix> craigbass1976: No...I'm in australia
[05:36] <ke4nt> Texas
[05:36] <craigbass1976> I haven't a clue then
[05:36] <PhibreOptix> It's weird because, if I leave it idle for the same amount of time through the day
[05:36] <craigbass1976> PhibreOptix, have you gone through the logs?  Dmesg and mesasges?
[05:36] <PhibreOptix> It never freezes
[05:36] <PhibreOptix> No, I don't really have much idea how to go through the logs
[05:37] <PhibreOptix> Bit of a linux newbie ;)
[05:37] <craigbass1976> PhibreOptix, that is weird... Wonder if it's got something to do with the date changing
[05:37] <itsmabus> Anybody know of a decent ircd for ubuntu that I can configure to only accept connections from localhost?
[05:37] <mmr> heya there
[05:37] <ThomBrown> guys, can someone help me, I just bought a samsung yp-u2j audio player, and i can't get ubuntu to eve NOTICE it, let alone mount it . . . i think it's FAT 32
[05:38] <mmr> for some reason synaptic's reload is stuck in file 9 (of 14)
[05:38] <james296> can someone help me with using the startup manager? I add a startup program called Glippers I installed and I typed it in to start at system startup, but after I close the startup manager and open it again, its gone
[05:38] <james296> why is this happening?
[05:38] <craigbass1976> PhibreOptix, sudo cat /var/log/messages and see if there's anything funny there.  Also, try leaving it at 11:50 PM and check on it at about 5-10 past midnight, see if it froze.
[05:38] <mmr> perhaps it is trying to contact a server which is down (to get this files) and seems to have a really long timeout (just guessing), what can i do to bypass this?
[05:39] <james296> so can someone help me out here?
[05:40] <L0cKd0wN> what's the command to restart a service via tty ?
[05:40] <craigbass1976> james296, what file is the startup manager writing to?
[05:40] <L0cKd0wN> under fedora i used to do: service vsftpd restart
[05:40] <james296> what do you mean lol
[05:40] <bretzel> hi all, ubuntu rules the linux world! too much wonderfull : just fresh-install onto a Toshiba Satellite A100 (centrino dual) --all working out of the box ...
[05:40] <L0cKd0wN> but that doesn't work here

[05:40] <james296> I just typed Glipper in the box to run it at startup
[05:40] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, you switching too?
[05:40] <L0cKd0wN> fedora doesn't support shfs
[05:41] <L0cKd0wN> (cleanly)
[05:41] <bruenig> james296, needs to be glipper, lowercase
[05:41] <L0cKd0wN> so yea
[05:41] <bretzel> bruenig:uh?
[05:41] <L0cKd0wN> i need support for it, and fuse-sshfs doesn't cut it
[05:41] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, is that the sh***y file system?
[05:41] <PhibreOptix> AFK
[05:41] <james296> still did the same thing
[05:41] <L0cKd0wN> no why do you say that?
[05:41] <L0cKd0wN> it's been running stable i mean... guess time will tell heh
[05:42] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, never heard of it, and was trying to figure out what the acronym stood for.

[05:42] <L0cKd0wN> but yea, im learning all new stuff, been raised of fedora
[05:42] <mkoby> Hi all, I removed a hard drive from my system, how do I cause Dapper to not try to mount it?
[05:42] <L0cKd0wN> since fedora core 1
[05:42] <L0cKd0wN> but time to switch
[05:42] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, how are you liking ubuntu?
[05:42] <L0cKd0wN> :)
[05:42] <L0cKd0wN> well it's out of the box faster
[05:42] <genii> Is anyone having a weird half-blank screen during Feisty install?
[05:43] <L0cKd0wN> but it's hard to make a comparison, cuz im not actually sure what's installed and what's not, some stuff I still haven't gotten to work... like VNC
[05:43] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, notice the install time?  Course, not so much softrware out of the box, but there's a lot more in the apt repos I think than yum.
[05:43] <mmr> ok, i got the problem
[05:43] <L0cKd0wN> apt-get seems quicker than yum... but some stuff i woulda had up and running in a blast, and im STILL troubleshooting
[05:43] <james296> so, anymore help plz?
[05:43] <bimberi> geez, !offtopic was a bit harsh there
[05:43] <genii> Feisty = pre 7.04
[05:44] <L0cKd0wN> i still don't know what's going on with VNC
[05:44] <mmr> during the installation i configured my country, what suggested ubuntu to use close mirrors in sources.list
[05:44] <L0cKd0wN> i login and get a logo....
[05:44] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, where are you trying to vnc to and from?
[05:44] <bruenig> bimberi, funny contrast though, pretty much an admonishment for being laudatory about the OS
[05:44] <L0cKd0wN> windows xp -> ubuntu
[05:44] <mmr> everything ok, but... the server it suggested seems to be down
[05:44] <bimberi> mmr: it does that from your country selection
[05:45] <mmr> bimberi: yes and how am i supposed to change that?
[05:45] <mmr> bimberi: just editing the file?
[05:45] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, hmmm.  Nothing on the ubuntu forums?  I'm still new too (also started linux on FC1) and haven't run across vnc yet.
[05:45] <mmr> bimberi: shouldnt it, say, have a timeout and try a 'default server' or something?
[05:45] <james296> well?
[05:45] <mkoby> Hi all, I removed a hard drive from my system, how do I cause Dapper to not try to mount it?
[05:45] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: yea i recognized ur nick from fedora... heh
[05:46] <kitche> mkoby: edit your /etc/fstab
[05:46] <craigbass1976> mkoby, should be somewhere in /etc/fstab
[05:46] <mmr> mkoby: /etc/fstab
[05:46] <bimberi> mmr: probably, you could file a bug on it
[05:46] <__david> hello, could anyone help me troubleshoot my Xorg with an rv350/9600XT radeon card?  I can't seem to get direct rendering to work
[05:46] <mkoby> Do I just delete the line(s) in fstab?
[05:46] <bimberi> mmr: yes, editing /etc/apt/sources.list would be the way
[05:46] <mmr> mkoby: comment them
[05:46] <L0cKd0wN> man /etc/fstab
[05:46] <jokoon> Hello again...
[05:46] <mmr> bimberi: right
[05:46] <mkoby> Ok, and then reboot?
[05:46] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I'm seeing a few folks in here off and on that I recognize.
[05:46] <james296> someone plz tell me what to do...
[05:46] <__david> does anyone know if the rv350 is compatible with direct rendering?
[05:47] <mmr> mkoby: if you already removed the hd, why would you want to reboot?
[05:47] <Assasein84> i got a little question... im want to try out ubuntu but in the web theres various options were to download it from.. http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download#currentrelease
[05:47] <mkoby> I just commented the fstab line?
[05:47] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: yea i've searched some of the forums, tried a few things still no luck
[05:47] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: im sure i'll figure it out
[05:47] <L0cKd0wN> eventually...
[05:48] <Assasein84> i have to choose from which Os im downloadig the iso or were i want to install it?
[05:48] <Mahdi> hi, where can i get linux-image-2.6.17-7-generic for amd64? 2.6.17-10 seems to have an issue with my wireless card
[05:48] <PhibreOptix> Back
[05:48] <Assasein84> anyone?
[05:49] <Mahdi> PhibreOptix: u were right =P dumb error on that fstab stuff... missing a g+w chdmod =/ LOL
[05:49] <craigbass1976> james296, sorry, I didn't see your reply to me.  The files (if what we're talking about is making something start at boot) should be in the /etc/rc folders.  I don't knwo what glipper is, and I'm not sure exactly how this goes, but whichever folder it shows up in decides which runlevel the program runs in.
[05:49] <james296> ???
[05:49] <Mahdi> PhibreOptix: tkz ;)
[05:49] <jokoon> Just for info, I ask several times for a problem I just found is very common : http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241254 I just hope next time I'll be forwarded better than today. Sorry for the whine.
[05:50] <PhibreOptix> Mahdi: No problems
[05:50] <zeeble> heya.. which is the feisty fawn channel?
[05:50] <james296> ummmm, which rc folder?

[05:51] <L0cKd0wN> where's the config for vsftpd hiding?
[05:51] <tonyyarusso> zeeble: Yay!
[05:51] <Assasein84> i ve a little question... i want to try out ubuntu, but in the webpage theres various options were to download it from.. http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download#currentrelease ... i have to choose from which Os im downloadig the iso or were do i want to install it?
[05:51] <craigbass1976> james296, I'm not sure.  You have to google for it.  Find out exactly how those folders work and go from there.  Weird that the GUI wouldn't do it though...
[05:51] <zeeble> what processor do you have in your machine, Assasein84?
[05:52] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, yes, things are moved around a bit...
[05:52] <Assasein84> core duo
[05:52] <james296> well, I have a confession
[05:52] <Assasein84> but a pentium in the one i want to install it
[05:52] <genii> core duo = i386 version
[05:52] <genii> (SMP kernel)
[05:52] <craigbass1976> james296, nothing really bad, hopefully...

[05:52] <james296> and they said it isnt fully stable
[05:53] <james296> I just dont know how to remove that now

[05:53] <craigbass1976> james296, well, maybe it's not, or maybe it makes no difference.
[05:53] <PhibreOptix> Assasein84: http://shipit.ubuntu.com  get a free ubuntu cd sent to you ;)
[05:53] <craigbass1976> james296, how did you install it?
[05:53] <Mahdi> anybody knows any way to downgrade my kernel to 2.6.17-7? 2.6.17-10 prevents my wireless card from working =/
[05:53] <Assasein84> thanx ppl! :D
[05:53] <james296> just by using the installer
[05:53] <zeeble> Mahdi: your bootloader doesnt give you the option to boot with the older kernel?
[05:53] <craigbass1976> james296, you didn't type a command?  I think if you used the gui to install it, you can just uncheck the box.
[05:54] <holycow> oh challenge is spaceships
[05:54] <holycow> neato :)
[05:54] <james296> yeah I used the GUI
[05:54] <zeeble> Mahdi: when you boot up, it will ask you which kernel to use.. choose the one where your stuff works
[05:54] <james296> but theres no checkbox
[05:54] <james296> lol
[05:54] <Assasein84> PhibreOptix: im not in USA :s
[05:54] <craigbass1976> well, what's the package called?
[05:54] <craigbass1976> james296,
[05:54] <Mahdi> zeeble: i just had to reinstall edgy from the cd... the official release doesnt include 2.6.17-7. Only 2.6.17-10
[05:54] <holycow> wher eis the challenge hosted, blender.org or blenderartists.org?
[05:54] <Assasein84> but thanx
[05:54] <holycow> oh shit wrong channel
[05:54] <holycow> sorry
[05:54] <zeeble> Assasein84: download it. it will take a few days if you asked anyway
[05:54] <PhibreOptix> Assasein84: I'm in austrlia
[05:54] <zeeble> Mahdi: aw
[05:55] <Assasein84> mmm ok
[05:55] <PhibreOptix> Assasein84: And one got sent to me
[05:55] <zeeble> but you can download it faster :)
[05:55] <james296> what
[05:55] <Assasein84> thnx 4 da info
[05:55] <TJ_>  james296: is this orange theme you speak of by any chance orange-look?
[05:55] <bhudda> what is the name of the program or whatever that monitors system heat and controls fan speed?
[05:55] <james296> yes it is
[05:55] <PhibreOptix> But if you get the CD sent to you, you get some cool, free Ubuntu stickers with it ;)
[05:55] <Mahdi> zeeble: but from where? LOL ubuntu's archive does not include them anymore!
[05:56] <zeeble> Mahdi: download the kernel source and compile it?
[05:56] <TJ_> james296: if you didn't install it more than one time, than you should be able to go around, and restore all of the icon backups
[05:56] <james296> ok...how?
=== KissMyBean is now known as BlackCheese
[05:56] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: yea like im used to vsftpd config files residing in /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf , here it's just /etc/vsftpd.conf, so when I listed the directories I automatically skipped over it and missed it heh
[05:57] <Mahdi> zeeble: but then i miss the whole point about using a std kernel =//
[05:57] <zeeble> Mahdi: wait
[05:57] <TJ_> james296: just recall the install, then go into the icon folders where it had said it was changing themes
[05:57] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I've noticed (when trying to copy mail over) that .thunderbird doesn't exist either, it's .mozilla-thunderbird.  Installing things where the names are different is weird too
[05:58] <james296> its not the icons Im worried about
[05:58] <james296> its gettin the Startup manager working!
[05:58] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: i hear ya, how long have you been an ubuntu user?
[05:58] <TJ_> jame296:...
[05:58] <zeeble> Mahdi: whatis the kernel package aclled?
[05:58] <james296> yes?

[05:58] <Mahdi> zeeble: linux-image-2.6.17-7-generic
[05:58] <james296> I cant add anything to system startup...
[05:59] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I tried it for a couple of weeks before the FIRST planned FC6 release date, couldn't deal with sudo, and ended up putting FC5 on.
[05:59] <BlackCheese> Praise Sweet baby Jesus
[05:59] <glick> hi i am not quite following the ubuntu boot process i.e. how it brings the system to different runlevels
[05:59] <craigbass1976> Then I put it on again about a month ago and am rather liking it.
[05:59] <glick> i gues after it reads the inittab runlevel
[05:59] <BlackCheese> I feel Jesus is behind Ubuntu..... Praise the lord can I have an amen!
[05:59] <glick> it goes into the rc#.d folder
[05:59] <L0cKd0wN> im certain you can enable root, yea the sudo bugs me too
[05:59] <glick> and runs the scripts there
[05:59] <glick> but what does the rcS.d folder to
[05:59] <zeeble> Mahdi: http://altruistic.lbl.gov/mirrors/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.17/ look there
[06:00] <s0nix> hi
[06:00] <TJ_> james296: odd, i've never ecountered anything like that, but when my comp was buggy, i had made a script that would launch all of my startup programs for me, thats the best i've got
[06:00] <glick> and also, i dont see any kill scripts for when you change into a lower runlevel
[06:00] <PhibreOptix> If using sudo in ubuntu bugs you so much
[06:00] <nick_> can anyone help me with a sound juicer problem
[06:00] <glick> can someone explain this to me?
[06:00] <PhibreOptix> Just run the root terminal instead
[06:00] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I'd rather when I need to be root when running the printer config gui or something, that it would ask me for root's pass instead.  I trid configuring it todo that, but messed it up I guess.
[06:00] <Mahdi> zeeble: good =D but only udebs... will that cause me trouble?
[06:00] <s0nix> anyone can help me: i want to  make my TV-OUT (ATI) like a second screen with a different RESOLUTION.... at the moment... its a clone of the real screen.
[06:01] <james296> I'll just be lazy and fix the problem by reformatting and installing again lol
[06:01] <zeeble> Mahdi: dunno. you'll have to build the kernel. with kernel package prolly
[06:01] <PhibreOptix> Anyway guys
[06:01] <zeeble> Mahdi: or look around in the mirror for the package you want
[06:01] <PhibreOptix> I'm off
[06:01] <aWu>  #include <stdio.h>
[06:01] <aWu>  int main()
[06:01] <aWu>  {
[06:01] <aWu>  printf("hellow world!");
[06:01] <aWu>  return 0;
[06:01] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I did set a root pass though, because it's easier sometimes to just be root for a while in the terminal
[06:01] <aWu>  }
[06:01] <zeeble> aWu: geez.. what was that? and it is "hello", not hellow
[06:01] <TJ_> james296: well thats no fun, be creative and invent some new ways to do it
[06:02] <craigbass1976> james296, we all do it starting out.  Eventually, you get mad and figure it out instead.
[06:02] <sc4ttrbrain> !pastebin | aWu
[06:02] <ubotu> aWu: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:02] <nick_> has anyone gotten sound juicer to rip mp3's
[06:02] <uffiole> i upgraded to edgy some weeks ago and now i run update manager the first time and it says not all upgrades can be performed, do distro upgrade
[06:02] <squisher> Hi, does anyone know how to get rid of the locale warnings in dapper?
[06:02] <Mahdi> zeeble: how did u fidn this mirror? i browsed through a lot of them and did not find all these versiones
[06:02] <zeeble> Mahdi: just googled
[06:03] <james296> I do admit it is startin to piss me off lol
[06:03] <squisher> I google for it, and find lots of posts with the same error message, but nowhere a solution
[06:03] <Mahdi> zeeble: damn... i've been googling for the last 2 hours and found nothing! LOL
[06:03] <zeeble> Mahdi: rofl.
[06:03] <craigbass1976> Hey, can anyone tell me how, with the slip of a mouse, I ended up detaching the ubuntu chat from the rest of my XCHAT window?  It is in a window all by itself now.
[06:03] <bimberi> nick_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CDRipping
[06:03] <L0cKd0wN> lol
[06:03] <L0cKd0wN> neat trick craigbass1976 :P
[06:03] <zeeble> Mahdi: all i put was 2.6.17-7 .deb ubuntu in google, and this was a "index of/" link so went in
[06:04] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, only if I can do it again...
[06:04] <L0cKd0wN> haha
[06:04] <Mahdi> zeeble: tkz a lot =P i'm already downloading and backuping it :)
[06:04] <nof> omg wireless help needed d-link dwl-510, isn't atheros just supposed to work =(
[06:04] <Mahdi> zeeble: i tried even with the exact name!
[06:04] <zeeble> Mahdi: hm, ok. good luck with the install then
[06:04] <Mahdi> zeeble: tkz :)
[06:05] <Mahdi> time to reboot
[06:05] <Mahdi> tkz zeeble
[06:05] <Mahdi> cya
[06:05] <cjjtcha> You don't really need to set a root password, just type `sudo bash`. Same thing
[06:06] <GpartedCreator> Hi
[06:06] <nof> getting a error for wireless reqest "set encode" (8B2A) : invalid argument "s:"
[06:06] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, oh, there's a detach tab commandin the Xchat menu.  There must be a mouse/keyboard shortcut that does the same thing.  I think you have to use your elbow though...
[06:07] <bimberi> cjjtcha: 'sudo -i' is preferable (sets up the environment)
[06:07] <squisher_> Hi, I was just here a moment ago but my computer crashed. Did anyone by chance answer about the locale warnings in dapper? I searched the net and faq to no avail
[06:07] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: i don't have the luxury of a desktop right now.... damn VNC! *shakes fist*
[06:07] <cjjtcha> bimberi: Thanks, even better. I didn't know that
[06:07] <L0cKd0wN> and im horrible
[06:07] <bimberi> cjjtcha: np :)
[06:07] <L0cKd0wN> at elbow commands
[06:07] <L0cKd0wN> lol
[06:08] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, oh, I didn't realize you weren't even in Ubuntu yet.
[06:08] <L0cKd0wN> ssh man
[06:08] <L0cKd0wN> that's all i gots
[06:08] <L0cKd0wN> lol
[06:08] <nof> any wireless ninja's around??
[06:08] <L0cKd0wN> i don't really need a desktop
[06:08] <L0cKd0wN> like gui, cuz im pretty efficient w/ the tty
[06:09] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, although it's sometimes nice to use the GUI...
[06:10] <L0cKd0wN> it's on a 600mhz celeron, performs like a champ
[06:10] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I just put dapper on a similar box for my son today.   Did you see http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2005-December/053266.html?
[06:11] <fede23> Hello, anyone wanna help me install ubuntu 6.10 ?
[06:11] <L0cKd0wN> iptables....
[06:11] <L0cKd0wN> why didn't i think of that
[06:11] <L0cKd0wN> brb!
[06:11] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, could be windows security stuff stopping things.  I don't think you even have iptables
[06:12] <fede23> How can I install ubuntu 6.10 in dual boot without erasing my entire hdd ???
[06:12] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: looks like security is handled a bit differently under ubuntu, iptables is empty :S
[06:13] <co_maniez> hy
[06:13] <dabaR> fede23: ask the installation program to resize its partition. _Back_ up data.
[06:13] <L0cKd0wN> gonna try: " iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 5900:5905 -j ACCEPT "
[06:14] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, do you even have iptables?  Where'd you find it?
[06:15] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I'm behind a Cent firewall, so I've not been worried about Ubuntu security yet.
[06:15] <L0cKd0wN> iptables: /sbin/iptables /lib/iptables /usr/share/man/man8/iptables.8.gz
[06:16] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, and the vnc server is actually running on Ubuntu box?
[06:17] <dabaR> craigbass1976: it is installed by default
[06:17] <L0cKd0wN> i think Xvnc is
[06:17] <fede23> dabaR I've sent you an im, so we can chat better.
[06:17] <L0cKd0wN> vncserver i had to obtain
[06:17] <L0cKd0wN> maybe there's a conflict.....
[06:17] <L0cKd0wN> Xrealvnc *
[06:17] <dabaR> fede23: just talk here
[06:17] <craigbass1976> dabaR, Ahh, I didn't know that.  I thought ubuntu didn't have iptables by default.
[06:17] <dabaR> L0cKd0wN: and your iptables should adapt to the enabled server
[06:17] <disant> hi
[06:17] <co_maniez> hy
[06:18] <disant> anyone had problems setting up ethernet card using tulip to full-duplex/100?
[06:18] <disant> LNE100TX
[06:18] <MSTK> hey all
[06:18] <ColonelZarkawi> greetings
[06:19] <MSTK> does anyone know if there are any way to watch Windows Media Player videos on Ubuntu?
[06:19] <MSTK> no workaround or anything?
[06:19] <disant> MSTK, mplayer
[06:19] <dabaR> MSTK: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[06:19] <Madpilot> MSTK, most wmv vids should work
[06:19] <MSTK> well, I can play wmv's
[06:19] <MSTK> but the ones embedded in firefox
[06:19] <MSTK> and webpages
[06:19] <MSTK> it doesn't seem to be supported
[06:19] <fede23> ok dabaR, I'm in the window where it asks me to select my hard drive.
[06:19] <fede23> I have 2 hdd on raid 0, and it gives me the option to select one of them.
[06:20] <L0cKd0wN> yea there's definitely two vnc programs running
[06:20] <L0cKd0wN> Xvnc and vncserver
[06:20] <L0cKd0wN> i only see one config though, this is wild
[06:20] <disant> mozilla-mplayer
[06:20] <dabaR> fede23: hehe, make sure you choose the right option to resize the drive, and did you _back_ up your data?
[06:20] <MSTK> disant - thanks, I'll check it out
[06:20] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, what if you shut one off?
[06:20] <disant> enjoy
[06:20] <blargityblarg> heyy anyone here?
[06:21] <disant> no
[06:21] <zeeble> no
[06:21] <MSTK> no
[06:21] <blargityblarg> awesome
[06:21] <disant> everyone's out for lunch
[06:21] <blargityblarg> um
[06:21] <disant> I'm watching the sheeps
[06:21] <MSTK> actually we are all just computer programs
[06:21] <MSTK> programed with automatic responses
[06:21] <MSTK> we don't actually exist
[06:21] <blargityblarg> does anyone not out to lunch feel like helping me with an opengl problem?
[06:21] <disant> ... when they come back.. I'll go for lunch
[06:21] <MSTK> in fact nobody truly exists.
[06:21] <MSTK> it's all a virtual reality program
[06:21] <dabaR> MSTK: programs can spell programmed...
[06:21] <blargityblarg> ok
[06:21] <blargityblarg> well
[06:21] <L0cKd0wN> yea im trying
[06:21] <blargityblarg> for my purposes
[06:21] <diskus> lunch?
[06:21] <blargityblarg> it will do
[06:21] <zeeble> just go ahead and ask, blargityblarg
[06:21] <L0cKd0wN> i need to figure out what's running tho
[06:21] <blargityblarg> ok
[06:22] <fede23> what do you mean by "_back_ up" ? is it a command ?
[06:22] <blargityblarg> im just really confused on which way to go with nvidia drivers i read so much conflicting info
[06:22] <blargityblarg> im on the latest mepis
[06:22] <blargityblarg> trying to get opengl to work
[06:22] <blargityblarg> quake3 runs
[06:22] <blargityblarg> but extremely slowly
[06:22] <disant> burepe, kombanwa
[06:22] <dabaR> fede23: I mean, did you save your important files to an external hd, or a dvd?
[06:22] <Madpilot> !enter | blargityblarg
[06:22] <ubotu> blargityblarg: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[06:22] <blargityblarg> ok
[06:23] <Madpilot> blargityblarg, also, if you're on Mepis, why are you in #ubuntu?
[06:23] <blargityblarg> because
[06:23] <blargityblarg> noone is talking in there
[06:23] <blargityblarg> and its the next closest thing i suppose
[06:23] <dabaR> is mepis based on Ubuntu?
[06:23] <blargityblarg> yes
[06:23] <sc4ttrbrain> then switch to us first :D
[06:23] <dabaR> haha
[06:23] <blargityblarg> the newest mepis is based on ubuntu
[06:23] <Madpilot> blargityblarg, ATI or Nvidia card?
[06:23] <blargityblarg> i just made the switch from ubuntu to mepis
[06:23] <blargityblarg> nvidia
[06:23] <Madpilot> !nvidia | blargityblarg
[06:23] <ubotu> blargityblarg: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:23] <blargityblarg> ok ok
[06:24] <diskus> what's wrong with ubuntu so that you wanted to install mepis?
[06:24] <fede23> not all of them, but is that the only way to install ubuntu 6.10 ???
[06:24] <fede23> erasing everything and installing from scratch ?
[06:24] <blargityblarg> for the hell of it
[06:24] <L0cKd0wN> craigbass1976: take a look please, this is as far as the login goes: http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a179/ArcTuRuX/screen.jpg
[06:24] <L0cKd0wN> just so you know what im talkin bout ;)
[06:25] <dabaR> blargityblarg: http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/Hardware#NVIDIA
[06:25] <blargityblarg> ty
[06:25] <dabaR> blargityblarg: heh.
[06:25] <charlie5> hi again folks ... just discussing 'beryl' desktop manager with a friend ... has anyone tried this with ubuntu ? i think its in 'unstable'
[06:26] <Arigato> where are apache log files stored?
[06:26] <diskus> ofcourse beryl is unstable
[06:26] <diskus> and XGL in overall
[06:26] <dabaR> !beryl | charlie5
[06:26] <ubotu> charlie5: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[06:26] <PhibreOptix> Hi guys, does anybody know of a visual form designer for coding similar to visual basic's one that runs on Ubuntu?
[06:26] <bimberi> Arigato: /var/log/apache (iirc)
[06:26] <dabaR> PhibreOptix: did you try monodevelop?
[06:26] <L0cKd0wN> ur httpd.conf might tell you
[06:26] <L0cKd0wN> ;)
[06:27] <genii> arigato /var/log/apache2/access.lo /var/log/apache2/error.log
[06:27] <PhibreOptix> dabaR: No I didn't, so thank you
[06:27] <genii> access.log
[06:27] <charlie5> dabaR: thank you ... i ddn't think to try uboto :
[06:27] <uMISTA> how do i add new users, the command way?
[06:27] <disant> beryl? nah.. sticking to fluxbox
[06:27] <bimberi> uMISTA: sudo adduser
[06:28] <diskus> well fluxbox is not 3d multimedia :P
[06:28] <disant> sudo useradd
[06:28] <disant> diskus, that's why it rox :)
[06:28] <craigbass1976> L0cKd0wN, I don't knwo what to tell you.
[06:28] <diskus> disant: it's not fun, but otherwise it's better than this 3D desktop
[06:29] <dabaR> ya, its like, what's this talk about beryl...as if I need an app slowing down my computer...
[06:29] <diskus> it's not that slow if it's supported by hardware
[06:29] <kuto> i get clock skew problem when compiling with anjuta
[06:29] <diskus> actualy it wasn't slow at all on my computer when I last tried it
[06:29] <dom> hi, I just installed the "network-manager-gnome" as per the wifi WPAHowTo on the ubuntu site, and it's not giving me any options to manage the wireless
[06:30] <dom> when I left-click on it, it just shows that "wired network" is selected
[06:30] <disant> I can write you a small C program that will effectively assist you in utilizing about 98% of your system resources :)
[06:30] <zeeble> disant: haha
[06:30] <dom> or greyed-out if I unplug the ethernet cable
[06:30] <dom> do I have to do something to get it to recongize the wireless?
[06:30] <disant> dom: a driver
[06:30] <dom> I'm currently connecting via the neighbour's crappy un-protected network
[06:31] <zeeble> :p
[06:31] <disant> dom, what type of card is it?
[06:31] <dom> lspci says it's a Intel PRO/Wireless 2915ABG MiniPCI Adapter rev 05
[06:31] <disant> man.. just got iptables up and running on my wireless router.. sweet thing
[06:32] <disant> dloaded fwbuilder to get my rules just the way I want them.. push it out.. voila
[06:32] <disant> dom: and what driver are you using?
[06:33] <dom> mmm ipw2200
[06:34] <disant> dom: also.. are you sure that your neighbour has a crappy unprotected network and not a access-point simulator, luring dumbasses like yourself, sniffing your packets, having more fun then a barrel of monkeys?
[06:34] <dom> this is my point
[06:34] <NoonInSF> PowerPC user, no luck in the forums and little luck in the IRC with my problem.  Computer refuses to suspend or hibernate. Can anyone point me in the direction of a webpage or something?
[06:34] <dom> I don't want to be connecting to random unprotected netowkrs
[06:35] <fede23> I'm back
[06:35] <disant> fede23, at last
[06:35] <cmt^^> How do I change default program for playing video?
[06:35] <fede23> please help me disant, I can't set up my raid 0 installation without deleting my entire hard disk.
[06:36] <glick> heh i still run dapper on the desktop
[06:36] <glick> anyone here still runnin dapper?
[06:36] <Geoffrey2> at times I wish I still was....
[06:36] <glick> fiesty givin you problems?
[06:37] <Geoffrey2> isn't feisty the first 2007 release?
[06:37] <silentace> sorry to be a newb... but is ubuntu a good candidate for a linux newb?
[06:37] <rapid_> silentace, sure
[06:37] <glick> i mean edgy
[06:37] <juancarlos> silentace, yes.
[06:38] <glick> silentace, you have unix experience at all?
[06:38] <Geoffrey2> I've got a small list of problems I'm trying to fix....most of them more annoyances than anything else
[06:38] <glick> its alot different if your used to solaris or something
[06:38] <silentace> i didn't see anything on the main ubuntu site... is there a good place to go to get some modules (may be called something else) to add to my disc image?
[06:38] <VerdRousseau> anyone here have a Dell Truemobile 1180
[06:38] <silentace> glick: no
[06:39] <glick> silentace, install the main disk then you can download whatever else you need/want
[06:39] <silentace> windows guru and thats it... trying to expand my knowledge on various OSs
[06:39] <Ash-Fox> I'd like to set the order of three soundcards. The method I've found requires that I set in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base, options module-name index=<number for sound device>, unfortunately. I have two soundcards that use the same module (snd_usb_audio), unfortunately as they are USB devices, I can plug them into any port -- so I can't really rely on which port they're plugged into. "asoundconf list" does however name one "Headset" and the other 
[06:39] <silentace> so is the image from there site a live disc or no?
[06:39] <glick> im so ignorant on a windows machine
[06:39] <glick> im like where do i click
[06:39] <glick> what do i do
[06:39] <silentace> with the iso i download from ubuntu is that an install disc or a live linux distro?
[06:40] <glick> been using unix and linux regularly for like 7 years
[06:40] <glick> heh
[06:40] <Ash-Fox> silentace, both.
[06:40] <silentace> thanks ash
[06:40] <glick> and windows only in labs n stuff for papers what not
[06:40] <SurfnKid> glick, i think im very ignorant now too, i feel weird when i boot to xp
[06:40] <silentace> i am a heavy gamer and thats the only reason i stay away from mac/linux
[06:40] <glick> MS word is the depth of my windows knowledge
[06:40] <SurfnKid> i only boot to XP for gaming and hd space file management, nothin else
[06:41] <silentace> i know there is a lot of experimental things for gaming with windows games on linux but nothing solid enough to make me switch cold turkey
[06:41] <glick> yeah
[06:41] <SurfnKid> I find copyrights and IP has gotten way to dumb to be worrying about fines
[06:41] <Ash-Fox> silentace, meh, games like WoW actually perform better under Wine running on Linux in my experience, unfortunately getting it working is another story.
[06:41] <silentace> surfnkid... makes since
[06:41] <bhudda> I can't get my SATA drives to mount...
[06:41] <glick> i havent played games in a long time
[06:41] <silentace> maybe i should think about that
[06:41] <glick> its too bad, linux wold make a fine game platform
[06:41] <glick> loki proved that
[06:41] <silentace> so is installing ubuntu on a sata going to be a problem
[06:41] <glick> but companies just wont do it
[06:41] <GigaClon> what does firefox usally take up in memory, its  taking up 80MB here
[06:42] <GigaClon> and its being slow
[06:42] <dope> depends on how long it's been running
[06:42] <glick> theres just too many damn distros each doing there own thing, so their like "well which distro should we develop for?"
[06:42] <glick> so i can kind of understand why they generally wont
[06:42] <silentace> gigaclon: 120meg
[06:42] <kbrosnan> GigaClon: that is fairly normal usage
[06:42] <dope> firefox has a really bad memory leak
[06:42] <silentace> i got a few extensions though
[06:42] <SurfnKid> dope, oh?
[06:42] <dope> you ain't heard?
[06:42] <SurfnKid> FF2?
[06:42] <glick> dope, firefox goes down more often then a 2 dollar assistant crack hoe
[06:42] <Fede23b> ok, now I'm ready.
[06:42] <Ash-Fox> glick, develop for one, such as redhat. the other distros will find ways to get the game working. It's been that way with commercial software, and worked fine.
[06:43] <dope> pretty sure ff2 has it too
[06:43] <silentace> anyone ever messed around with slax?
[06:43] <glick> its really frustrating
[06:43] <kbrosnan> dope, GigaClon etc.
[06:43] <rapid_> silentace, what about it?
[06:43] <kbrosnan> dope, GigaClon etc. http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/faqs/memusage.html
[06:43] <glick> brb laundry drp off
[06:43] <Geoffrey2> glick, and then there's the FOSS movement, which probably leaves some wondering how many would actually shell out money for a game on Linux if they spent the time porting it
[06:43] <SurfnKid> glick, hehe
[06:43] <Ash-Fox> glick, I doubt it has anything todo with the fragmentation of linux distros, but more of the fact that developing for such a niche user base is not going to bring much of a profit.
[06:43] <silentace> just wondering (im so clueless on this) whats the difference? i know there is different cores and all
[06:43] <SurfnKid> !slax
[06:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about slax - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:43] <cmt^^> Anyone know how to change default players in ubuntu edgy?
[06:44] <SurfnKid> whats slax
[06:44] <SurfnKid> slackware?
[06:44] <glick> silentace, slax is a sweet live distro
[06:44] <SurfnKid> oh
[06:44] <krustofski> slack live cd
[06:44] <rapid_> SurfnKid, its based on slackware.
[06:44] <silentace> yeah
[06:44] <_Rebecca> Anyone know how I would install a mozilla rdf file?
[06:44] <SurfnKid> i see
[06:44] <krustofski> nothing special
[06:44] <krustofski> you can use it to make your own distro too
[06:44] <glick> for rescue, or when you just wanna boot into a linux machine and all you have is your grandmothers win98 machine
[06:44] <leandro-1> hello
[06:44] <silentace> so any thoughts on whether installing ubuntu on a sata partition will be a bitch or not?
[06:44] <disant> :) sometimes I just enjoy sitting back and looking at this chat...
[06:44] <leandro-1> a program to synchronization mpx220 to ubuntu edgy?
[06:45] <disant> reminded me of my colege days when we used to get stoned in my friend's basement
[06:45] <silentace> does ubuntu deal with dual booting as well? or will i have to find that information elsewhere
[06:45] <zeeble> _Rebecca: the RDF file comesalone, or with its .js file as well?
[06:45] <disant> silentace, it'll allow you to configure dualbut
[06:45] <rapid_> disant: i'm still stuck in those days
[06:45] <PhibreOptix> silentace: Yea, when you goto install it it resizes your other partitions so you can dualboot easily
[06:45] <SurfnKid> silentace, dualboot is what ive got, runs 100%
[06:45] <sartan> Okay so... I'm a little surprised there isn't a default iptables firewall on hoary..
[06:45] <_Rebecca> zeeble it comes with the .js as well
[06:45] <sartan> is there a package to provide one or am i going to have to write my friend some scripts myself
[06:45] <dabaR> _Rebecca: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework
[06:45] <disant> i dont get dualbooting though
[06:46] <disant> if you want to play w/OS.. just get vmware.. its free
[06:46] <krustofski> what dont you get?
[06:46] <_Rebecca> dabaR thanks for the link
[06:46] <silentace> so if right now my patitions cover all the space on my drive it will take some away from it for me?
[06:46] <PhibreOptix> disant: VMware is slow as hell with larger applications
[06:46] <krustofski> vmware requires decent specs
[06:46] <disant> PhibreOptix, "play"
[06:46] <leandro-1> hi, my english suck but somebody knows a program to mpx220 sinchronization to ubuntu edgy?
[06:46] <silentace> what is not to get about dual booting? i want to learn linux but i still need windows for games and such
[06:47] <Geoffrey2> ok, lesse...biggest bug, after hours of running the computer under linux, I will hit a point where nothing wants to load up...any icon I click on starts the little wait icon spinning and a name appears in the task bar, then it dissapears completely...session manager won't come up...I can't even get the log off/shut down menu to come up...only way to fix is to hold the power button down until the computer shuts off
[06:47] <krustofski> linux is overrated
[06:47] <PhibreOptix> silentace: Dual booting is the way to go IMO
[06:47] <disant> silentace, that was a personal thing.. sorry :)
[06:47] <krustofski> stick with windows
[06:47] <silentace> no need for appologies
[06:47] <rapid_> krustofski, get the hell out of here
[06:47] <PhibreOptix> krustofski: Then why are you here? In an ubuntu chat
[06:47] <silentace> i am horrible at spelling by the way =)
[06:47] <krustofski> because i use ubuntu?
[06:48] <MSTK> ROFL
[06:48] <_Rebecca> zeeble: actually it just comes with the .rdf
[06:48] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Firstly, start programs from the terminal to see if they print output.
[06:48] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, when that's happening, I can't even bring up the terminal window
[06:48] <silentace> my basic reason for wanting to learn some sort of windows is to eventually learn how to maintain my own webserver, which i think would be easier if i had some type of linux experiance on my resume
[06:48] <disant> f*&^*&^*&6
[06:48] <disant> stupid tulip driver
[06:49] <zeeble> _Rebecca: then you have to create the file that will allow Mozilla to open the rdf
[06:49] <h00t> hello can some pls tell me how can i install non-free codecs fro use w/ mplayer (wanna play XM radio stream)
[06:49] <PhibreOptix> Did everybody here about the new flash player 9 for Linux?
[06:49] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Secondly, never hold the power button to restart Linux! You should always restart it cleanly to avoid filesystem corruption: press alt+sysrq+s, alt+sysrq+u, alt+sysrq+b to sync the filesystems, unmount them, and reboot (respectively)
[06:49] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Sysrq is the print screen key.
[06:49] <hap0> hello
[06:49] <_Rebecca> zeeble: ok, not sure how to do that, but I'll do some googling. thanks
[06:49] <h00t> PhibreOptix, just installed it
[06:50] <MSTK> arrenlex - I'm scared now.  I've held down the power button in the past to do a hard reboot.  is there any way to undo the damage?
[06:50] <PhibreOptix> h00t: Does it play sound properly this time around?
[06:50] <h00t> here's a link ... yes
[06:50] <bblargitylarg> ok i got the driver installed on mepis but how do i enable opengl? i try to run quake3 but it runs at just a few frames per second
[06:50] <h00t> http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[06:50] <hap0> anyone have any tips on recovering sound after switching to KDE?
[06:50] <h00t> just drop it into /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[06:50] <rapid_> hap0: open your mixer and turn the volume up
[06:51] <zeeble> _Rebecca: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Install.rdf
[06:51] <h00t> can anyone help me w/ that non free codecs
[06:51] <hap0> rapid: Thanks I've checked that., But I'll check it again...
[06:51] <_Rebecca> zeeble: Thank you
[06:51] <Geoffrey2> file system corruption...been there, done that.......
[06:52] <PhibreOptix> h00t: try this http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/
[06:52] <arrenlex> MSTK: Don't worry, ext3 is really hard to corrupt, and fsck will catch it... but it's better to reboot cleanly, of course. :)
[06:52] <hap0> rapid: No dice. Anyone else have any ideas? I've been through a fair number of searches via google.
[06:52] <h00t> yeah .. i know about that ... but do you know why aren't they in regular depository
[06:52] <GigaClon> my firefox is scrolling very slowly
[06:53] <buitenzorg812_> i always fail using free ubuntu?
[06:53] <arrenlex> MSTK: Your computer will check the filesystems and fix any errors on boot.
[06:53] <buitenzorg812_> how come?
[06:53] <MSTK> ah, okay.  thanks
[06:53] <bblargitylarg> anyone on the opengl in mepis?
[06:53] <MSTK> free ubuntu?  as opposed to a paid version?
[06:53] <Fede23b> if I would die right now, I would ask god: WHY IS LINUX SO FRICKING HARD TO INSTALL/USE !?!?!?!?!?
[06:53] <PhibreOptix> h00t:  I think they aren't in regular depositary because they are propitary, but I may be wrong
[06:53] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: You can also use alt+sysrq+k to kill all processes that are running under you. See if that helps.
[06:53] <buitenzorg812_> sorry...i mean easyubuntu
[06:54] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: If it DOES help, chances are something you're running is leaking memory badly.
[06:54] <MSTK> Fede23b - actually, I found that Ubuntu is by far easier to install than Windows is
[06:54] <spx2> where is the repository list file ?
[06:54] <PhibreOptix> h00t: Try adding the universe and multiverse repositeries
[06:54] <zeeble> spx2: /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:54] <bblargitylarg> mepis took 30 mins to install fully with like two clicks it was amazing
[06:54] <spx2> zeeble: thx
[06:54] <arrenlex> Fede23b: Because Windows is installed by hardware manufacturers, so you don't have to. :)
[06:54] <h00t> ahhhh ... exactly .. my bad
[06:54] <bblargitylarg> pleeeeeeeeeease help with opengl on mepis
[06:54] <hap0> sudo apt-get install libxine-extracodecs
[06:54] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, ok, what do the s, u, and b commands do?
[06:55] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: I told you! Please read my sentences the whole way through. xD
[06:55] <arrenlex> (10:49:35 PM) arrenlex: Geoffrey2: Secondly, never hold the power button to restart Linux! You should always restart it cleanly to avoid filesystem corruption: press alt+sysrq+s, alt+sysrq+u, alt+sysrq+b to sync the filesystems, unmount them, and reboot (respectively)
[06:55] <buitenzorg812_> MSTK - i agree with you...
[06:56] <Geoffrey2> ah, sorry, sync, unmount, boot...got it
[06:56] <MSTK> Hi all, sorry for sounding naive, but I'm trying to download a plug-in for firefox (namely, mplayer).  I've downloaded the source file and it's an archive with a folder "mplayerplug-in".  Now I'm guessing that I am supposed to just extract this folder to the plugins folder?  Is that that direct, or do I have to do something in between with the terminal?
[06:56] <dom> ugh, apparently busting into the old wpa_supplicant.conf file by hand was the answer to connecting... I'd still like to know why the gnome network manager doesn't so much as acknowledge the wireless card.  aren't intel wireless chips supposed to be okay in general?
[06:56] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: To be fair you should probably run RSEIUB rather than just SUB, to put the keyboard in raw mode, sync the filesystems, send all processes the TERM signal, then KILL all processes that haven't yet terminated, unmount your filesystems, and then reboot. But that takes too long.
[06:56] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: (A mnemonic to remember that is Raising Skinny Elephants is Utterly Boring)
[06:56] <bblargitylarg> opengl....meppis
[06:57] <Geoffrey2> I don't ever wanna hear anyone in here poke fun of Ctrl-Alt-Del then :)
[06:57] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: All things windows are poked fun at here. :)
[06:57] <bimberi> MSTK: Just install it using synaptic - mozilla-mplayer  (multiverse repository)
[06:57] <spx2> WHAT IS YOUR OPPINION ON BERYL ?
[06:57] <MSTK> Beryl is shiny
[06:57] <MSTK> totally pointless, but awesome
[06:57] <rapid_> its a emerald
[06:57] <hap0> Beryl is fun.
[06:57] <sc4ttrbrain> !offtopic
[06:58] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[06:58] <bblargitylarg> opengl...mepis pleeeeeeeeease how to enable it
[06:58] <arrenlex> spx2: MY OPINION OF BERYL IS THAT IT IS FANCY. MY OPINION OF YOU IS THAT YOU SHOULD STOP YELLING AT US.
[06:58] <_Rebecca> spx2 Beryl is buggy
[06:58] <MSTK> bimbery - didn't think to look for a mozilla plugin in the packages manager.  thanks.
[06:58] <spx2> _Rebecca: really ?
[06:58] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, oh, that's a given...but Windows only required one three finger salute, usually preceded, followed, or both, by a one finger salute
[06:58] <spx2> arrenlex: do you think its a good substitute for gnome or kde ?
[06:58] <_Rebecca> spx2: Yes, in my experience
[06:58] <MSTK> i have to get used to the idea that all of my programs aren't scattered around the internet -- they're all organized in one handy place
[06:58] <Phrozen_One_> if DRI is disabled on an ATi card is that why all the fps are so terrible?
[06:58] <MSTK> and downloadable there

[06:59] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, ok, lesse....a large memory leak could be causing the problems I described?
[06:59] <hap0> Anyone else have any ideas on how to get sound working with KDE/Ubuntu???
[06:59] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: ctrl+alt+del also works to restart your computer if you're not running X... but usually your GUI catch that combination and assign it to something else.
[06:59] <spx2> foshizzle ma nizzle BERYL IS GOOD OR NOT !!!!!!!!! ??????????/
[06:59] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: A lot of things could be causing the problems you've described. Does it slow down gradually or does it suddenly just stop working?
[06:59] <rapid_> spx2: double gizzle to the pizzle, install it and find out, bitch
[07:00] <hap0> In X ctl-alt-backspace will restart WindowMgr.

[07:01] <Geoffrey2> shouldn't most children be in bed by now?
[07:01] <krustofski> no!

[07:01] <dabaR> spx2: last warning...
[07:02] <Geoffrey2> Madpilot, sadly......
[07:02] <sc4ttrbrain> spx2: :GO away !
[07:02] <krustofski> dont mind those elitist tards spx2
[07:02] <PhibreOptix> So, who here has played tux racer?
[07:02] <dabaR> sc4ttrbrain: chill out
[07:02] <krustofski> you seem like a nice fella
[07:02] <spx2> i promise it wont happen again
[07:02] <rapid_> Geoffrey2, its 5pm where I am. so no
[07:02] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Sorry, did you answer that? I asked if it slows down gradually or not?
[07:02] <dabaR> spx2: ok, move on
[07:02] <arrenlex> Yessir Mr. Op, sir.
[07:03] <PhibreOptix> How do you do that? I'm new to irc aswell xD
[07:03] <mypapit> w00f w00f
[07:03] <somerville32> arrenlex, Hobbsee is a Mam.
[07:03] <krustofski> lies
[07:03] <krustofski> no women on irc
[07:03] <arrenlex> somerville32: But that contradicts one of the basic tenents of IRC: the men are men, the women are men, and the little girls are FBI agents.
[07:04] <arrenlex> It cannot be!
[07:04] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, ok, I'm not really sure, what will happen is that I'll come back having left the computer running for several hours and find it in this state....
[07:04] <krustofski> unless of course.. post op trannys
[07:04] <Hobbsee> way cool, i'll be an FBI agent then.
[07:04] <Madpilot> arrenlex, krustofski - #ubuntu-offtopic, if you really must continue this conversation...
[07:04] <krustofski> lol
[07:05] <krustofski> how dare you... Hobbsee true identity matters.. i vote post op tranny
[07:05] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Anything unusual about your setup? Are you running any daemons that aren't in the default install?
[07:05] <dabaR> krustofski: stop it already, it is not related, I can not catch the questions
[07:05] <krustofski> pre op?
[07:06] <krustofski> so just a cross dresser?
[07:06] <dabaR> bye
[07:06] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, none that I'm aware of....I have the BOINC client running in the background, not sure if that is considered a daemon....
[07:06] <somerville32> krustofski, Thats enough. You're getting offencive now.
[07:06] <arrenlex> krustofski: Are you serious? Isn't getting kicked once enough to clue you in that maybe you should stop that? o_O
[07:06] <Hobbsee> Madpilot: i was about to forward that
[07:06] <Hobbsee> but thanks
[07:07] <dabaR> everyone likes to have fun :-)
[07:07] <Madpilot> Hobbsee, forward it to where? There isn't an #offensive-idiot channel that I know of...
[07:07] <bimberi> MSTK: depends on what it is really, sometimes it's in another repository, sometimes you need to compile it yourself
[07:07] <malt> does www.m4lt.com/stats/ work for everyone? i got psychostats working i think
[07:07] <somerville32> hehe
[07:07] <Hobbsee> Madpilot: *grin*.  was thinking to ##offtopic actually
[07:07] <h00t> hey ppl i have a really weird problem ... i am listening to a mms stream ... but it seem that in firefox totem is handling it .. how can i make it so mplayer will handle it
[07:07] <Hobbsee> dabaR: sure, and i get fun kicking people :)
[07:08] <arrenlex> h00t: The easiest way is to remove the totem-mozilla package.
[07:08] <dabaR> Hobbsee: would you say you get a kick out of it?
[07:08] <arrenlex> h00t: And install mozilla-mplayer.
[07:08] <Hobbsee> dabaR: perhaps :P
[07:08] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: BOINC shouldn't be a problem because it runs niced (only uses the CPU when nothing else is). Still, I don't run it so I dunno...
[07:09] <MSTK> bimberi - I'm new to this stuff.  in Windows all I had to do was run an .exe.  Is there a guide taht shows me how to compile things, etc?
[07:09] <h00t> arrenlex, yes i installed the mplaer as well as firefox plugin
[07:09] <arrenlex> !compile | MSTK
[07:09] <ubotu> MSTK: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[07:09] <dabaR> repos > MSTK
[07:09] <arrenlex> h00t: Then remove totem-mozilla and you're all set.
[07:09] <h00t> arrenlex, ok... let's see
[07:10] <Jbirk> I have a question about a NIC
[07:10] <Geoffrey2> now, another problem I have occasionally is when I go to shut down I get a black screen with the line, as I remember it "BCM43xx: Controller Reset (TX Timeout", constantly repeating
[07:10] <arrenlex> !ask  | Jbirk
[07:10] <ubotu> Jbirk: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:10] <MSTK> thanks, dabaR.
[07:10] <Jbirk> I bought a Gigabit NIC today, but it is terribly slow under Ubuntu
[07:10] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Does BCM43xx mean anything to you?
[07:10] <dabaR> MSTK: mozilla-mplayer is in multiverse.
[07:10] <Jbirk> It runs slower than the built in 10/100 VIA NIC built into my motherboard
=== rsa[aw]  is now known as chand
[07:10] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, it's the Broadcom chipset for my internal wireless
[07:11] <MSTK> dabaR - I know.  I just wanted to know for future reference if I stumble upon a plug-in that is not
[07:11] <rapid_> Geoffrey2, sounds like its not shuting down before you shutdown
[07:11] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Ah. I don't know anything about wireless, sorry. = /
[07:11] <Jbirk> I installed the Air Link 10/100/1000 Adapter with Realtec chipset and Ubuntu detected it fine
[07:11] <rapid_> Geoffrey2, before you shutdown try a simaple "ifconfig wlan0 down" where wlan0 is your interface.
[07:11] <Jbirk> Windows and the switch it is connected too both show 1 Gbps
[07:11] <dabaR> MSTK: compiling is simple, but remember to use checkinstall
[07:11] <Jbirk> ifdown wlan0 will work too
[07:11] <MSTK> thanks, I'll remember that
[07:12] <Jbirk> ANy ideas why the card is so slow
[07:12] <Jbirk> 289 minutes to copy 4.36 GB of data
[07:12] <MSTK> ack.  sorry for another question =/. I've just installed mozilla-mplayer, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on my browser after I restart firefox.  Is there something that I need to switch on?  A hidden setting?
[07:12] <Geoffrey2> MSTK, just curious about your name, is that MST3K, by chance?
[07:12] <Jbirk> Why is it that the built in 10/100 VIA junk in my mootherboard is way faster?  It does the copy in about 22 Min
[07:13] <Jbirk> MSTK, did you install mplayer too?
[07:13] <h00t> arrenlex, you were absolutely right ... what the hell did firefox do ... just "moved on" to a next available plugin
[07:13] <h00t> that's weird
[07:13] <MSTK> Geoffrey2 - Actually, no.  I picked this before I knew about MST3K.  But after watching it, I think I should have.
[07:13] <MSTK> Jbirk - yes
[07:13] <MSTK> all of the packages
[07:13] <Jbirk> should start streaming video
[07:13] <Jbirk> and playing it back
[07:13] <zarul> I hate firefox
[07:13] <Jbirk> did you also install the codecs
[07:14] <arrenlex> h00t: Firefox took the first plugin it detected that said it could handle video. If you go into "about:plugins" you can see a list of all the plugins installed and what they handle.
[07:14] <Jbirk> Firefox is actually quite good
[07:14] <zarul> it's getting heavier these  days
[07:14] <dabaR> mstk uninstall totem-mozilla, if you read the channel you would see h00t  has the same issue
[07:14] <MSTK> totem = the pre-installed media player, right?
[07:14] <Jbirk> yes
[07:14] <h00t> MSTK, ys
[07:14] <Jbirk> sometimes people have gxine
[07:15] <spx2> foshizzle babey
[07:15] <h00t> MSTK, I'd remove the whole thing ... i hate totem...
[07:15] <Jbirk> Oh, BTW, close Firefox
[07:15] <arrenlex> ...please don't start, spx2.
[07:15] <spx2> just installed beryl my nizzle
[07:15] <Jbirk> before installing the plugins
[07:15] <Jbirk> and install them as root
[07:15] <MSTK> spx2 - yes, Beryl is great
[07:15] <spx2> who the man now ?
[07:15] <MSTK> yet totally pointless
[07:15] <MSTK> which is what makes it even more great
[07:15] <Jbirk> Good ol' BerylManager eh?
[07:15] <MSTK> who cares if you don't need every window that you close to burst into flames?
[07:15] <Geetarman> quick question, what is a good irc client for ubuntu
[07:15] <spx2> yeah baby thats right,im the beryzzle my nizzle
[07:15] <Jbirk> I don't care much for Beryl these days
[07:15] <Jbirk> it is a bit buggy
[07:15] <arrenlex> spx2: You're the man, because you managed to install a 3D-accelerated window manager from third-party repositories. The ladies will be all over you.
[07:15] <MSTK> who cares if wobbly windows don't help you at all?
[07:16] <MSTK> they're still awesome
[07:16] <Jbirk> nor does the expose
[07:16] <Jbirk> yeah
[07:16] <Jbirk> true
[07:16] <Jbirk> I m iss the poping menus
[07:16] <Jbirk> ever since I did a beryl upgrade it was never as good
[07:16] <h00t> chix digg 3d X
[07:16] <MSTK> Wobbly Windows are the most pointless aesthetic feature ever.  Yet it's better than all of the eye candy in Windows Vista combined
[07:16] <Jbirk> I think the magic trick With Linux is
[07:16] <Jbirk> Nvidia Graphics Cards
[07:16] <spx2> yo , word out to my hommies on #ubuntu , beryl is shitizzle and it either don't workizzle so chill out
[07:16] <arrenlex> !enter | Jbirk
[07:16] <ubotu> Jbirk: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[07:17] <zarul> SpacePuppy can u please stop the shizzle mizzle my  niggaz thing?
[07:17] <Geoffrey2> and, of course, this is a Dell computer with a Broadcom internal wireless....needless to say, neither Dell or Broadcom provide Linux drivers for anything
[07:17] <zarul> ops
[07:17] <arrenlex> dieman_: Nice hostname.
[07:17] <zarul> sorry
[07:17] <zarul> spx2
[07:18] <srf21c> Anyone had any luck installing cinelerra on Edgy?
[07:18] <Jbirk> I think Ubuntu likes Broadcom, Intel, and Nvidia very much as well as AMD.  However, I don't think Linux plays well with other hardware much.  You wouldn't belive how much effort it took to get my mouse working right
[07:18] <spx2> srf21c: maybe cinderella ?
[07:18] <h00t> one more thing ppl ... this is the second time i've installed 6.10 ... but i've noticed that there's much less software installed this time and also some of the things (like mplayer plugin) look and behave differently .... question is ... do the official iso images actually change from day to day
[07:18] <srf21c> I added the repos according to the faq (digging for link)  program installed, but won't launch
[07:18] <zarul> spx2, he said cinelerra
[07:18] <arrenlex> srf21c: I've installed it on Debian Etch, which is close. Problems?
[07:18] <Jbirk> It is a movie studio
[07:18] <srf21c> pretty sure it's called cinelerra.  Looks like a typo, I know.
[07:19] <srf21c> Threw me at first too.
[07:19] <dabaR> srf21c: you followed http://cvs.cinelerra.org/getting_cinelerra.php#ubuntu?
[07:19] <spx2> zarul: thats right ma nigga , you have goog eye sight ,good for you,yay!
[07:19] <spx2> :D
[07:19] <Jbirk> I installed it on Dapper and it ran like a champ.  Much like final cut pro.  I really liked it.
[07:19] <srf21c> er, I did the lazy repos way,  ;)  let me see if I can dig up the link to the forum thread.
[07:19] <arrenlex> srf21c: What problems are you having with it?
[07:19] <dieman_> arrenlex: thanks
[07:20] <srf21c> Try to launch the program, and its pops up a "Program Crash Detected" windows
[07:20] <Rupie> My drives are /dev/sda,sdb... What does the s mean? Why is it not hda?
[07:20] <srf21c> Only says "Sorry, Cinelerra closed unexpectedly" then asks if I want to report a bug, etc.
[07:20] <dabaR> SATA vs. IDE
[07:20] <Jbirk> S is for SATA or SCSI or USB
[07:20] <zeeble> maybe you have a SATA controller, or SCSI
[07:21] <Rupie> What's the difference between sata and scsi?
[07:21] <zeeble> omg
[07:21] <Jbirk> $$$ and the BUS
[07:21] <dabaR> Rupie: wikipedia
[07:21] <disant> why would this happen.. I change the device settings w/mii-tool but it still shos the old settings?
[07:21] <srf21c> Running Edgy 6.10, w/all latest updateds.
[07:21] <Jbirk> SATA is a serial connection.  1 Cable 1 drive.  SCSI supports 8 to 16 devices with 0 reserved for SCSI BUS.
[07:21] <Pablo> anyone got a sprint aircard working on edgy?
[07:21] <arrenlex> srf21c: You could try to launch it from the command line and see if it prints an error.
[07:22] <spx2> yo ma hommiez ! noone listen to me anymo ? what up ?
[07:22] <Jbirk> CAn I overclock from within Linux?
[07:22] <Rupie> Oh... so just connections? The hard drives aren't different then?
[07:22] <Jbirk> That depends on what you mean by different?
[07:22] <Jbirk> The hard drive connections, jumpers, and controllers are different.
[07:22] <srf21c> Here's the post I used to install.   http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1721190&postcount=2
[07:22] <arrenlex> Jbirk: Depends what your cpu supports... cpufrequtils IIRC has the cpu-set-freq command to set your CPU frequency if your processor supports it.
[07:23] <Geoffrey2> ok, I want to download the latest Windows driver for my Broadcom wireless, and extract the firmware from it...given a choice between versions (98, NT, XP, etc), is there any particular version that would be preferable?
[07:23] <srf21c> arrenlex, good idea, I'll try that now.
[07:23] <Jbirk> The hard drives themselves are usually faster for SCSI and usually built to higher tolerances.
[07:23] <Jbirk> I.e. it is not uncommon to have 10,000 and 15,000 RPM SCSI drives
[07:23] <srf21c> When I try to launch cinelerra from the command prompt is sez;   Illegal instruction (core dumped)
[07:24] <Jbirk> cpufreq-selector --governor performance?
[07:24] <ThePub> good evening
[07:24] <Hoso001> Has anyone successfully emulated a recent realese of itunes?

[07:28] <Rupie> Thanx a lot jbirk :)
[07:28] <Jbirk> What did I do?
[07:28] <Rupie> Told me about scsi?
[07:28] <Jbirk> Oh, no problem.  I use it every day at work
[07:29] <Jbirk> The jumpers are Binary
[07:29] <Jbirk> i.e. the rule is that each drive must be configured differently than the other drives
[07:29] <akio> i want to use x as root
[07:29] <Jbirk> Scsi is hot swappable as is SATA, FYI

[07:37] <Madpilot> spx2, beryl is very very alpha, no wonder it crashes
[07:37] <mneptok> spx2: Beryl is more likely to not work than work.

[07:47] <fallingdutch> since i upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 i have a problem connecting to my svn-server: svn list svn://hostname/rep fails with "connot connet to host hostname. but a svn list svn://192.168.1.1/repname works. dig hostname returns 192.168.1.1 so what could be the problem?
[07:47] <monkey050> Heh.
[07:48] <monkey050> Do any of you guys know what to do in the case of installing 6.10 on one computer and then putting the harddrive into another?  (Laptop)
[07:48] <MSTK> hey all.  just a quick question.  Will the extensions that I used on my Windows version of Firefox still work the same on my Ubuntu version?
[07:48] <lambo4jos> mneptok: i am going to check this file but i am pretty sure it is available.  when i run query browser, it opens, i can create a table, but when i edit a table it fails and closes?  i dont know what gives
[07:48] <Madpilot> monkey050, this is a very international channel. "this hour" would probably include all 24 of them. ;)
[07:48] <monkey050> No problem.
[07:48] <monkey050> If anybody can help with my strange problem, I'm booting into recovery mode now.  Please PM.
[07:49] <ArwynH> MSTK: depends on the extensions, but probably yes.
[07:49] <tabman> I'm a traditional user of windows & I use google talk, msn etc there to do voice chat ? what is the alternative on Ubuntu given that people on the other side are not using Linux
[07:49] <srf21c> MSTK:  I think the extensions should work, unless they are platform specific.
[07:49] <mneptok> lambo4jos: then the problem is not installing the package, it's a problem with the software once the package is installed.
[07:50] <mneptok> lambo4jos: i would suggest checking LP for bug reports
[07:50] <srf21c> dabar:  Success!   Thank you very much.

[07:50] <ubotu> monkey050: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.

[07:50] <tabman> GAIM does not have voice ?
[07:50] <mneptok> lambo4jos: Launchpad
[07:51] <MSTK> Yeah.  Recently I re-installed all of my extensions.  But then the performance of FF degraded.  And sometimes sound on flash movies would be disabled until I restarted FF.  I think it's just a problem with one extension though.
[07:51] <monkey050> OK.
[07:51] <ArwynH> tabman: not yet, it's in the works. Skype has voice though.
[07:51] <monkey050> Is there someone I can converse with on PM about this?
[07:51] <monkey050> I can run though in detail what I did.
[07:51] <srf21c> wait, duh!  I put in a package source for the athlon

[07:52] <monkey050> I have a blinky typing line.
[07:52] <frogzoo> monkey050: a lot of people idle here, if you take your support to pm, it means other's can't learn from your experience
[07:52] <monkey050> Is there something I can do to make Ubuntu reconfigure the hardware settings?
[07:53] <monkey050> OK, I understand.
[07:53] <srf21c> alright, next video editing question, what do people here prefer, cinerella or kino?  I want to create Ogg Theora vids.

[07:53] <tabman> dabaR: ok thanks I'll look into
[07:53] <monkey050> So is there a way I can make Ubuntu boot properly in my situation?
[07:53] <frogzoo> monkey050: which piece of h/w doesn't work?
[07:53] <monkey050> It's not hardware not working, it's Ubuntu not booting right.
[07:54] <monkey050> I tried booting in Recovery Mode and the last line I have is "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"
[07:54] <MSTK> is there a shortcut to system monitor?  sort of like CTRL+ALT+DEL was for Windows?
[07:54] <Fede23b> how much time do you think it will take linux to be a noob-friendly os ?
[07:54] <monkey050> And then there's a thing that says "(initramfs) _" which I can type on
[07:54] <Fede23b> 5 years ?
[07:54] <frogzoo> monkey050: you installed on one machine, then switched the drive to another?
[07:54] <monkey050> Frogzoo:  correct.
[07:55] <monkey050> Frogzoo:  I'm assuming it's confused about the hardware configuration.
[07:55] <Fede23b> frog, what's your take on my question ?
[07:55] <dabaR> Fede23b: which user?
[07:55] <monkey050> Frogzoo:  I do not have a working CD drive on the computer the drive is in now - so is there some command I can use to make Ubuntu boot properly?
[07:56] <Fede23b> dabaR I don't understand your question...
[07:56] <srf21c> MSTK:  There's a tip in the Ubuntu guide that shows you how to map CTRL-ALT-DEL to system monitor
[07:56] <monkey050> Frogzoo:  OK, now everything just disappeared.
[07:56] <srf21c> Let me see if I can find the link for you.
[07:56] <monkey050> Wait, I pressed a button and it reappeared.
[07:56] <jch> I have a trackball/keyboard USB combination device. I've done a lot of researching on the subject and I cannot figure out why I can't get it working in Ubuntu. When I cat the stuff in /dev/input/ (for which a few obviously correspond to the device), I get no output for the trackball device. However, the keyboard and trackball work fine on a plain-jane Windows XP installation on the same computer.
[07:56] <frogzoo> monkey050: your best bet is an install on the native machine - consider installing from usb key if you can
[07:57] <srf21c> MSTK:  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_enable_Ctrl.2BAlt.2BDel_to_open_System_Monitor_in_GNOME
[07:57] <monkey050> I can't boot from USB devices with this computer as far as I know.  If windows worked, USB devices start working when it boots up.  :?
[07:57] <monkey050> The only USB key I have is 128MB.
[07:57] <MSTK> oh, I know how to map it
[07:58] <monkey050> Unless there's something I don't know.
[07:58] <MSTK> I just thought there was a default key combination
[07:58] <FERAS> please how can I configure my iptable  on my pc
[07:58] <srf21c> jch:  have you tried any other pointing devices under linux?  Maybe another mouse?
[07:58] <MSTK> or something
[07:58] <monkey050> I will get my USB key.
[07:58] <jch> srf21c: Let me try...
[07:58] <Fly_Molo_> hey can someone help me get wireless working on my zv6000 HP laptop (6.10 Edgy) i currently cannot connect to the internet because my ethernet cable isnt being detected
[07:58] <srf21c> MSTK:  now aware of any default system monitor keyboard shortcuts under Gnome.
[07:58] <srf21c> Or Kubuntu or Xubuntu
[07:59] <srf21c> er, "not" aware. :D
[07:59] <jch> srf21c, I don't have another USB pointer device, but I do have a Synaptics touch pad on the machine...
[07:59] <monkey050> I now have my 128MB usb key handy.
[07:59] <linux_user400354> monkey050: check the bios
[07:59] <srf21c> jck:  does your keyboard work at all?
[07:59] <frogzoo> srf21c: system -> prefs -> k/b shortcutws
[07:59] <jch> srf21c, The keyboard works, not the mouse function...
[07:59] <monkey050> 400354:  How do I get to it if GRUB keeps coming up???
[08:00] <screechingcat> i couple of programs im trying to install have dependencies in kdelibs4. but thats not available in the repos. the latest seems to be kdelibs4c2a. maybe i should get the fesity package ?
[08:00] <monkey050> I know how to get to it under normal circumstances but now it doesn't let me.
[08:00] <frogzoo> monkey050: nvm, installing from usb is a long haul unless you know what you're doing
[08:00] <srf21c> frogzoo:  I think what MSTK was asking is if there's a default out-of-box keyboard sequence for the system monitor.
[08:00] <Ganesh> guys help me.... I have installed dual OS... ubuntu n windows xp... But my grub is not get displayed...automatically ubuntu gets loaded.... help me?...i want choices to get appear in grub......
[08:00] <monkey050> So there's no commands I can use to make Ubuntu reconfigure its hardware setup or something?
[08:01] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Programs you're trying to install how?
[08:01] <monkey050> I have this line here I can type on in Recovery Mode.
[08:01] <srf21c> jch:  Do you happen to remember how windows detects your trackball under windows?  That info could be helpful getting it to work in Ubuntu
[08:01] <Fede23b> hahaha ganesh you are in real trouble
[08:01] <Fede23b> I'm a complete newbie, so I can't help you...
[08:01] <FERAS>  im new user on linux --how configure iptables to protect my pc --please
[08:01] <Fede23b> sorry
[08:01] <monkey050> It says "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off".  Then there's "(initramfs) _"
[08:01] <Ganesh> guys help me.... I have installed dual OS... ubuntu n windows xp... But my grub is not get displayed...automatically ubuntu gets loaded.... help me?...i want choices to get appear in grub......
[08:01] <screechingcat> arrenlex: .debs that i downloaded from kde-apps.org
[08:01] <frogzoo> Ganesh: the timeout on grub might be zero,,,
[08:01] <Fede23b> Somebody help poor Ganesh with grub !
[08:02] <lambo4jos> mneptok: how would i install mysql-query-browser from source?  and how do i find the dependencies?  i haven't found any good resources on this
[08:02] <srf21c> FERAS:  if you're a new user, you might want to try firestarter in lieu of iptables.
[08:02] <srf21c> Much easier to set up and configure firestarter IMO
[08:02] <screechingcat> arrenlex: even fesity doesnt seem to have kdelibs4. it has the same package as edgy
[08:02] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Ah. Yes, the ubuntu package is kdelibs4c2a, and no you don't need feisty packages.
[08:02] <Fly_Molo_> can someone help me getting my internet to work, my ethernet isnt working
[08:02] <ArwynH> FERAS: on a default install, you don't neet iptables. your system should be fine. no open ports, etc...
[08:02] <frogzoo> lambo4jos: why do you want source? the binary's fine
[08:02] <mneptok> lambo4jos: have you checked for bug reports, or filed one?
[08:02] <arrenlex> screechingcat: You're going to have to modify the dependencies in the poorly made debs or install from source.
[08:02] <monkey050> Is there anything I can do on this command line thing?
[08:02] <screechingcat> arrenlex: how do i modify the deps ?
[08:03] <srf21c> Fly_Molo:  Do you get a orange or green link light on the ethernet port?
[08:03] <monkey050> When I type help it gives me all kinds of commands
[08:03] <Fly_Molo_> nope
[08:03] <ArwynH> monkey050: probably. you have a command line? what command line? grub?
[08:03] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Uhh... not easily. To be honest I wrote myself quite a complicated shell script to handle the unpacking and repacking. I advise you to install from source... unofficial debs will probably cause problems because they're compiled for different libraries.
[08:03] <Fly_Molo_> and this is on Edgy 6.10
[08:04] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Are you sure you can't get whatever it is you're trying to get from the official repositories?
[08:04] <monkey050> I'm in Recovery Mode.
[08:04] <cmt^^> i have a problem changing file-associations in ubuntu edgy. I tried right-clicking the file[type]  I wanted to change, and then select Properties/Open With.. But the problem is that as a regular user I can't change anything in that list, and when changing stuff as root I don't see the effects as a regular user
[08:04] <srf21c> Fly_Molo:  That could be a problem.   Most ethernet cards will light up w/ a link light.  But not all.
[08:04] <cmt^^> anyone?
[08:04] <monkey050> Evidently, Ubuntu didn't load right and I have this line.
[08:04] <lambo4jos> mneptok: i filed one.  and the source package status for query browser status is removed but i dont know what that means
[08:04] <srf21c> Fly_molo:  Is there a link light on your switch or ethernet hub?
[08:04] <Fly_Molo_> but the thing is, 6.06 worked just fine
[08:04] <monkey050> It starts with "(initramfs)"  Then the blinky line
[08:04] <screechingcat> arrenlex: nope. i checked. they're not there. konverter, kmencoder and kooldock
[08:04] <FERAS>  I replace win with ubuntu on my pc to protect me from specific ip 172 . -----  I need to configure iptables to deny that ip
[08:04] <monkey050> but it says /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
[08:05] <srf21c> Fly_Molo:  Do you remember what kind of driver your network card was using in 6.06?
[08:05] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Then I suggest you install from source.
[08:05] <Fly_Molo_> no, it was a little while ago
[08:05] <Fly_Molo_> but it was a broadcom
[08:05] <Fly_Molo_> i know my wireless
[08:05] <Chandu> is there any way to add additional langauags (locales) without doing "dpkg-reconfigure locales" , thru any other command or script
[08:05] <screechingcat> arrenlex: alright thanks
[08:05] <srf21c> Fly_molo:  ok, sorry I assumed it was wired ethernet.
[08:06] <Fly_Molo_> it is
[08:06] <screechingcat> arrenlex: what would happen if i forced it ?
[08:06] <Fly_Molo_> the wired ethernet isnt working either
[08:06] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Especially since, randomly googling for kooldock, I find that a) the debian package link is broken, and b) it's for Debian Sid, which isn't even ubuntu and probably won't be compatible.
[08:06] <arrenlex> screechingcat: Then it will complain about unresolved dependencies every time you use apt-get or synaptic for anything.
[08:06] <srf21c> Fly_molo, does lspci show your ethernet device?  What kind of adpater is it? integrated, pci card, usb?
[08:07] <screechingcat> arrenlex: shit. definitely had enough of that. thanks mate
[08:07] <arrenlex> !language
[08:07] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:07] <screechingcat> sure. sorry
[08:07] <monkey050> So nobody here can help me?
[08:07] <Fly_Molo_> its integrated
[08:07] <srf21c> screechingcat:  try swearing in obscure furren languages instead.  Works like a champ. . ;)
[08:07] <Fly_Molo_> Realtek
[08:08] <ArwynH> monkey050: doesn't look like it.
[08:08] <Fly_Molo_> its on a laptoip
[08:08] <srf21c> fly_molo  ok.  does lspci command show the device?
[08:08] <jb0nd38372> lol srf21c, always some way to get past anything, until its patched hhehe... or in the bots case, added too
[08:08] <Fly_Molo_> yeah
[08:08] <somerville32> srf21c, Try not swearing at all - works like a champ ;] 
[08:09] <ArwynH> monkey050: if i had the system at hand i could probably do something, but i'm not up to explaining something i havn't done before over irc. sorry.
[08:09] <screechingcat> srf21c: chuthya (f**ker in hindi)
[08:09] <monkey050> You could probably recreate the problem by installing Ubuntu on one laptop and then putting it in another.
[08:09] <monkey050> That's my problem.  It won't boot on the other laptop.
[08:09] <ArwynH> monkey050: basicly what you need to do is reconfigure your packages. either by hand or automatically via dpkg
[08:09] <monkey050> It just gives me a goofy command line kind of thing.
[08:10] <monkey050> I see a (initramfs) _ that I can type on
[08:10] <ArwynH> monkey050: i don't have 2 laptops available >_>
[08:10] <srf21c> fly_molo:  that's good.  Now what does lsmod say?  Do you see a realtek module loaded?  I forget what the exact name is off the top of my head.
[08:10] <ArwynH> hmm. try typing 'ls'
[08:10] <monkey050> Wouldn't it do the same for 2 desktops?
[08:10] <asnubuntu-> hi all ! how to remove the games of gnome?
[08:10] <monkey050> Anyways, before that it says /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
[08:10] <lambo4jos> frogzoo: how would i install query browser binaries and where would i get them?
[08:11] <ArwynH> monkey050: i'm asuming this is 6.10?
[08:11] <monkey050> Yes
[08:11] <Fly_Molo_> well i dont see anything with realtek in it
[08:11] <barata> how to install Boutell's gd?
[08:11] <barata> apt-get install WHAT?
[08:11] <barata> or it is not in the repository?
[08:11] <monkey050> I mentioned it was 6.10 earlier.
[08:11] <srf21c> Can someone help us out?  Anyone know what the module name for a realtek nic is?
[08:12] <frogzoo> lambo4jos: sudo apt-get install mysql-query-browser
[08:12] <barata> gdbm?
[08:12] <ArwynH> monkey050: what is the output of 'ls'? or rather does it give output?
[08:12] <lambo4jos> frogzoo: this is for dapper and after an install and opening browser, i can create table but when i edit table it shuts down.
[08:12] <monkey050> let me try
[08:12] <frogzoo> srf21c: best bet is to google for the make/model + 'linux driver'
[08:12] <foo> I shouldn't have any issue with drivers on ubuntu with this, right?  POWERCOLOR X800GTO256MBDDR3 Radeon X800GTO 256-bit PCI Express x16 Video Card - Retail
[08:13] <monkey050> When I type ls it gives me more commands.  dev, bin, etc, modules, scripts, usr, proc, var, root, etc etc.
[08:13] <adriano> does pvmove even work in ubuntu?
[08:13] <FERAS>  I replace win with ubuntu on my pc to protect me from specific ip 172 . -----  I need to configure iptables to deny that ip
[08:13] <adriano> for me it just hands there
[08:13] <srf21c> thanks frogzoo.   fly_molo did you catch that?
[08:13] <adriano> hangs*
[08:13] <Fly_Molo_> yeah im going to search for that now
[08:13] <srf21c> once you have the module name, you can try to manually load it using the insmod command.
[08:13] <frogzoo> Fly_Molo_: best bet is to google for the make/model + 'linux driver'
[08:13] <ArwynH> monkey050: now, does 'dpkg' give any output?
[08:14] <monkey050> Let me try
[08:14] <monkey050> "/bin/sh: dpkg: not found"
[08:14] <monkey050> NOTE: This is in the Recovery Mode thing.
[08:14] <frogzoo> monkey050: this would be fixable maybe for an expert - your best bet is finding a workable cd drive
[08:15] <monkey050> Yeah, I found http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=264583&highlight=swapped+hard+drive which mentions a similar problem.
[08:15] <monkey050> I just wouldn't know how to disable the drives or anything.
[08:15] <ArwynH> monkey050: yes. i've never been in recovery mode before, i wasn't sure what it was. Your drives aren't mounted in it it seems.
[08:16] <srf21c> fly_molo:  also forget to ask if you saw any errors in dmesg output.  That could provide some clues as well.
[08:16] <monkey050> So if I go to GRUB is there a way for me to mount it?
[08:16] <monkey050> I can mount in Recovery Mode too, though
[08:16] <ArwynH> monkey050: you can do it from recovery mode.
[08:16] <srf21c> fly_molo, did you upgrade over your old 6.06 installatino?  Or was this a clean install?
[08:16] <monkey050> Ok, so what do I tell it?
[08:16] <Fly_Molo_> clean install
[08:16] <PhibreOptix> Hey guys, I just did a sudo cat /var/log/dmesg and in it I found
[08:17] <PhibreOptix> ACPI: Looking for DSDT ... not found! Is this bad?
[08:17] <ArwynH> monkey050: do you know what your root partition is?
[08:17] <monkey050> whatever the default 3 letters is and 0 or 1.
[08:17] <monkey050> I can't scroll up to see what it was trying to load though
[08:17] <monkey050> I can however go and see in GRUB
[08:17] <srf21c> PhibreOptix:  did you aready try searching for "ACPI and DSDT" in the ubuntu forums?
[08:17] <aldwin> hi
[08:18] <monkey050> I just have to Ctrl Alt Delete
[08:18] <HymnToLife> !hi | aldwin
[08:18] <ubotu> aldwin: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:18] <aldwin> is there anynone here who knows what is the meaning of GNU???
[08:18] <monkey050> Should I go to the regular command in GRUB or stay in Recovery Mode?
[08:18] <HymnToLife> Generally Not Usable
[08:18] <PhibreOptix> srf21c: No, i'll go do that now
[08:18] <frogzoo> monkey050: did you read & follow the page you posted?
[08:18] <arrenlex> aldwin: GNU'S Not Unix :P
[08:18] <monkey050> There's no specific instruction.
[08:18] <srf21c> aldwin:  It's a backronym.   "Gnu Not Unix.
[08:18] <aldwin> what does that mean then?
[08:18] <arrenlex> aldwin: It means GNU isn't Unix?
[08:18] <aldwin> HmmToLife: Generally Not Usable?
[08:18] <monkey050> It says basically to try installing on the other machine and disable drives.
[08:19] <arrenlex> aldwin: They were kidding.
[08:19] <monkey050> But the installation was a little to simple and it didn't mention any drives.
[08:19] <HymnToLife> (in case you guys didn't get it, it was a _joke_ :p)
[08:19] <fallingdutch> anyone an idea why i can't connect to my svn-server using its hostname but can if using its ip althought dig hostname returns the ip?
[08:19] <arrenlex> !kidding | HymnToLife
[08:19] <ubotu> HymnToLife: You may think your joke is funny, but you may confuse new users or irritate people who actually start answering your question :)
[08:19] <srf21c> aldwin:  It's a form for wordplay.  It's more or less meaningless.
[08:19] <monkey050> I'm going to go to GRUB.
[08:19] <fallingdutch> (had no problems with ubuntu 6.06)
[08:19] <ArwynH> monkey050: grub won't tell you anything. try mounting /dev/hda1. "mount /dev/hda1"
[08:19] <frogzoo> monkey050: the point about similarity of machines wasn't lost on you? what are the differences between them?
[08:19] <aldwin> hmm
[08:20] <monkey050> Mine's a Sony PCG-GR250 and the othe was a Dell something.
[08:20] <aldwin> i really need to know what GNU means
[08:20] <srf21c> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym
[08:20] <HymnToLife> srf21c, actually it's quite meaning ful, given that GNU was designed as a free alternative to UNIX
[08:20] <frogzoo> !gnu
[08:20] <ubotu> G(NU's) N(ot) U(nix). A project that aimed to develop a complete operating system of Free Software, which Ubuntu is based on. See http://gnu.org
[08:20] <monkey050> I'll try mounting that in a second.
[08:20] <aldwin> i dont know if it is allowable or is it right for me to print the linux 101 at linux.org?
[08:20] <HymnToLife> aldwin, GNU's Not Unix, as people told you
[08:20] <srf21c> HymnToLife:  ok, you're right, I rescind that statement.
[08:20] <frogzoo> monkey050: and did you check for the differences that link mentioned?
[08:21] <barata> how to install Boutell's gd?
[08:21] <monkey050> yes, I read it.
[08:21] <barata> the answer is "apt-get install php5-gd"
[08:21] <monkey050> I have a nonfunctional CD Drive and the Dell has one.  That's the only major hardware difference AFAIK.
[08:21] <barata> 100 for myself!
[08:21] <srf21c> I meant that to say that backronyms are not inherently meaningful.  They're kind of confusing to the uninitiated.
[08:21] <barata> 0 for you all
[08:21] <frogzoo> monkey050: what are the h/w differences?
[08:21] <barata> :)
[08:21] <aldwin> so can anyone tell me what does it mean if GNU means Generally Not Usable???
[08:21] <jb0nd38372> I hear jeopardy music
[08:21] <monkey050> I just said
[08:22] <frogzoo> aldwin: that was meant factiously
[08:22] <monkey050> Hold on - I'm going back to recovery console and I"m going to try to use the mount command.
[08:22] <frogzoo> facetiously even
[08:22] <barata> aldwin: 
[08:22] <aldwin> frogzoo,i dont get it.
[08:22] <barata> so stupid
[08:22] <srf21c> aldwin:  Spend some time on wikipedia.   You're question is best answered there  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU
[08:22] <jb0nd38372> aldwin: My definition of GNU in that sense would have to be, Winders :P
[08:23] <ArwynH> i have heard some sonys don't boot anything other than the os it comes installed with... not sure how accurate that is though.
[08:23] <frogzoo> aldwin: nvm, geek humour can be a little opaque
[08:23] <monkey050> Not accurate at all evidently.
[08:23] <srf21c> fly_molo:  any luck?  I'm about ready to check out.
[08:23] <barata> damned! where does ubuntu place httpd?
[08:23] <monkey050> I was able to use the LiveCD of 5.10.
[08:23] <monkey050> But this is an OLD Sony.
[08:23] <arrenlex> aldwin: That was a joke. GNU does not mean "generally not useable". GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix. That's it. There's nothing more to it.
[08:23] <monkey050> I'm typing on a New Sony now.  lol
[08:24] <monkey050> OK I have my command line.  I'm going to mount /dev/hda1
[08:24] <ArwynH> heh. ok, i stand corrected. :)
[08:24] <diskus> Is it possible nowadays to make desktop size bigger than physical display?
[08:24] <monkey050> Ummmm I can't use spacebar.
[08:24] <monkey050> Do I have to do it in GRUB?
[08:24] <monkey050> OK.
[08:24] <HymnToLife> if you want to edit entries, yes
[08:24] <HymnToLife> otherwise, no
[08:24] <monkey050> I just typed mount on its own
[08:24] <monkey050> Mount returned the following:
[08:25] <monkey050> none on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec)
[08:25] <monkey050> none on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec)
[08:25] <monkey050> udev on /dev type tmpfs (rw)
[08:25] <HymnToLife> monkey050, what do you want to do ?
[08:25] <monkey050> i want to boot the darn thing.  lol
[08:25] <barata> where on earth is my httpd?
[08:25] <frogzoo> monkey050: let me put it straight - you have buckleys of fixing this & it will be very frustrating for you to try
[08:25] <HymnToLife> mount alone will just tell you what is currently mounted and where
[08:25] <foo> uh, I mv'd the apache2 dir in /etc after I uninstalled apache with --purge ... and I reinstall apache, and the dir doesn't come back with configs. Any ideas?
[08:26] <monkey050> Ok
[08:26] <jb0nd38372> diskus: Have you seen beryl by chance?  Its not stable yet, but it does what your asking about and much more.. lotsa eye candy, nothing really productive, course i'm not considered productive, thats why I am messing with it :P
[08:26] <monkey050> So how would I go about disabling a CD device upon reinstallation if I reinstall in the other computer again?
[08:26] <frogzoo> monkey050: maybe borrow a cd to do the install
[08:27] <monkey050> I have the CD.
[08:27] <monkey050> I don't have a functioning DRIVE in the computer I want to install on!
[08:27] <diskus> jb0nd38372: no beryl/XGL is different thing :P
[08:27] <frogzoo> monkey050: the cd shouldn't cause you problems if it's missing - what are the other h/w differences between the 2 ?
[08:27] <L0cKd0wN> hey guys, my dad has 56k
[08:27] <L0cKd0wN> can he use ubuntu?
[08:27] <diskus> jb0nd38372: what I want is to have screen size like 2048x1024 for example but physical resolution 800x600
[08:27] <frogzoo> monkey050: for instance, is one amd, the other intel?
[08:27] <monkey050> Absolutely not.
[08:27] <monkey050> I don't know any Dells that are AMD.
[08:27] <ThePub> L0cKd0wN: internet connection speed does not determine you're ability to run a linux.
[08:27] <jb0nd38372> diskus: Ahh sorry, thought you meant something like the desktop plane feature where you can scroll to different desktops, my bad
[08:28] <monkey050> And I also don't know any Sonys that are AMD.
[08:28] <srf21c> LockDown:  He can, but I would recommend setting up a local software repository or he'll probably grow old and die before he can install all his software.
[08:28] <L0cKd0wN> i mean
[08:28] <monkey050> I do know that neither are AMD and that there aren't any other major differences.
[08:28] <ThePub> L0cKd0wN: But like anything, on a slower connection package updates will take longer.
[08:28] <L0cKd0wN> is it posibble to get an internet connection ?
[08:28] <ThePub> L0cKd0wN: of course.
[08:28] <srf21c> Software installation works much better over broadband.
[08:28] <frogzoo> monkey050: so they're both intel with only one hard drive (and an extra cdr on one)
[08:28] <ArwynH> frogzoo: with 6.10 it should be using the generic kernel anyway, so it should run on both, right?
[08:28] <jb0nd38372> diskus: hmmm interesting idea... googling that.. :)
[08:28] <digitalsatori> I'm learning Plone, I would like to upload a document instead of typing the content,but I can't find the upload document link where it stated in the plone book. Help pls.
[08:28] <L0cKd0wN> he has to use windows software they give him
[08:28] <monkey050> They're both Intel all-around, ATI graphics, but one doesn't have a working cd drive.
[08:28] <monkey050> Correct.
[08:28] <monkey050> Laptops.
[08:28] <frogzoo> ArwynH: I'm trying to figure out why it's not working, when it should
[08:28] <srf21c> Lockdown:  Many windows apps can run under linux via Wine.
[08:28] <monkey050> Ok.
[08:29] <diskus> jb0nd38372: it was possible to do that like 6-7 years ago when I used it
[08:29] <L0cKd0wN> he has to use software that he downloads, then installs
[08:29] <srf21c> If he sports $40 or so for Crossover, he can run most major windows apps no problem.
[08:29] <ThePub> L0cKd0wN: if it's some form of company vpn connection or something, why bother running Linux?
[08:29] <L0cKd0wN> i think he'd like it
[08:29] <frogzoo> monkey050: in that case, it may be that the problem's not in swapping over the HD, but that ubuntu won't run on this laptop's old h/w
[08:29] <monkey050> I'm in GRUB now - what happenes if I edited the kernel boot line from /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hdc2 ro single and replace the HDC2 with HDC1?
[08:29] <srf21c> http://www.codeweavers.com/
[08:29] <ThePub> L0cKd0wN: There's no advantage to running Linux if Windows has everything you need and works.
[08:29] <monkey050> It meets requirements.
[08:30] <monkey050> Even if minimum.
[08:30] <L0cKd0wN> hmmm
[08:30] <jb0nd38372> diskus: Ahh, well i'm by no means seasoned any any form of linux... windows spoiled me for many years, but when I gave up gaming I started in ubuntu, i'm not start, but i'm determined :)
[08:30] <srf21c> I would disagree with ThePub about that.
[08:30] <frogzoo> monkey050: but the chipsets might not actually work
[08:30] <L0cKd0wN> what if i brought my ubuntu box home
[08:30] <srf21c> For one, there are no license keys for fees to worry about with Ubuntu.
[08:30] <ArwynH> monkey050: ! replace hdc2 with hada2
[08:30] <monkey050> Oh.
[08:30] <L0cKd0wN> what if i brought my ubuntu box home, (for christmas)
[08:30] <ArwynH> monkey050: hda2
[08:30] <ThePub> srf21c: you're welcome to, but like the cliche statement goes:  "if it ain't broke don't fix it!"  :)
[08:31] <monkey050> ArwynH, that's in the kernel part of the boot line thing - that's safe to edit to, right?
[08:31] <L0cKd0wN> could i get updates lol
[08:31] <diskus> jb0nd38372: well I'm still gamer, but that doesn't mean I have to move 100% to Linux :P
[08:31] <cmt^^> how do you guys change file-associations in ubuntu edgy?
[08:31] <monkey050> I edited it, so I'll try to boot now
[08:31] <ArwynH> monkey050: yes, change all hdc? to hda?
[08:31] <srf21c> ThePub;  Absolutely.   I guess it begs the question of why LockDown wants to have his Dad run linux then.
[08:31] <monkey050> Ok
[08:31] <arrenlex> ThePub: I disagree. Windows had everything I needed but I wouldn't go back to it for anything because Linux is so different. There's a community that cares about the operating system, there's a concept of freedom, it's powerful and customisable, and it's so easy to give something back... it's wonderful. Windows has nothing that comes close.
[08:31] <monkey050> And I switched 2 to 1.
[08:31] <ArwynH> monkey050: no, don't switch the numbers
[08:31] <monkey050> Ok
[08:32] <srf21c> cmt:  You should be able to right click the file in the file manager, select properties.
[08:32] <ArwynH> monkey050: just the letter
[08:32] <ThePub> arrenlex: and do you run your linux box on a company connection that supposedly needs to run windows-based software provided by that company? :)
[08:32] <ArwynH> monkey050: and it _should_ boot.
[08:32] <monkey050> OK.
[08:32] <monkey050> I'll try it now
[08:32] <jb0nd38372> diskus: Well I admit I play world of warcraft still, but wine is doing an excellent job of running that.. and WHEN I can keep beryl from crashing my friends that use windows freak out when I cube the display and rotate wow full screen.. I'm too old to be showing off.. ugh
[08:32] <arrenlex> ThePub: No. I'm just disagreeing with your general statement.
[08:32] <monkey050> It's making more information!
[08:32] <monkey050> I THINK IT'S WORKING!
[08:32] <srf21c> Then Then click on the "open with" tab.
[08:32] <monkey050> It's starting stuff!
[08:32] <monkey050> Configuring network blabhlabh
[08:32] <frogzoo> monkey050: oh congrats
[08:33] <monkey050> Setting up console font and keymap...
[08:33] <ArwynH> monkey050: not so fast. you'll need to modify grub and the fstab to get things to work properly.
[08:33] <monkey050> OOPS.  I did it in Recovery Mode.  LOL
[08:33] <monkey050> It gave me the regular recovery command line.
[08:33] <ArwynH> monkey050: from here on it's know territory :)
[08:33] <ThePub> arrenlex: I didn't make a general statement.  it was a statement specific to this situation.  unless his dad is a professional, familar with the ins-and-outs of Linux, and cares to deal with the ups and downs of trying to mesh into a Windows network, then it will definitely not be worth the trouble.
[08:33] <lubix> msg chanserv
[08:33] <ArwynH> monkey050: don't worry.
[08:33] <ArwynH> monkey050: recovery mode is better
[08:33] <ThePub> arrenlex: it's an application of not-so-common, common sense.
[08:33] <monkey050> I'll make the switch on the regular boot
[08:33] <monkey050> Really?
[08:34] <ArwynH> monkey050: it won't work yet.
[08:34] <monkey050> Ok so it says root@Pau-UBUNTU:~#
[08:34] <monkey050> oops, Paul, not Pau
[08:34] <monkey050> That's my name.  ^_^
[08:34] <monkey050> So what do I type now?
[08:34] <srf21c> Lockdown:  Did you check out codeweavers?  If you decide to run Ubuntu, that will probably be well worth the investment for your Dad.
[08:34] <ThePub> arrenlex: if it were a general statement I'd be a hypocrite since, like you, my XP box has worked without fail for years :)
[08:35] <cmt^^> srf21c - I did, but as a regular user I can't do anything with that
[08:35] <monkey050> I want the GUI now, not the silly blinky line.
[08:35] <ArwynH> monkey050: nano /boot/grub/menu.list
[08:35] <monkey050> K
[08:35] <cmt^^> srf21c - and as root any changes I make won't matter to the regular user
[08:35] <frogzoo> ThePub: if you haven't had xp trouble, you haven't used it much :)
[08:35] <glick> its a shame how many people there are that still havent even heard about ubuntu
[08:35] <monkey050> I can't use spacebar still.
[08:35] <ArwynH> monkey050: we have to change the references to your hard drives.
[08:35] <glick> even engineers where i work havent heard of it
[08:35] <ArwynH> monkey050: eh? no spacebar?
[08:35] <ThePub> frogzoo: maybe you're using it wrong? :)
[08:35] <monkey050> Not in Recovery Console or GRUB lines.
[08:36] <srf21c> cmt:  Where is the file located?  Are you sure you have permissions to modify it in the first place?  If not, you made have to grant permissions to user your account from the command line using sudo chmod/chown first.
[08:36] <monkey050> What if I just use "nano"
[08:36] <frogzoo> ThePub: nope, doesn't do what it says on the can
[08:36] <ArwynH> monkey050: erm... try regular boot then.
[08:36] <ThePub> frogzoo: neither does Ubuntu ;)
[08:36] <monkey050> Wait, what if i tried nano and it gave me some kind of further instruction?
[08:36] <ArwynH> monkey050: nano is an editor.
[08:36] <monkey050> Ok.  Then i'll just Ctrl Alt Del
[08:37] <monkey050> Now it's stopping all the happy stuff.  "Will Now Restart"
[08:37] <srf21c> cmt:  are you signed in as your regular user account right now?
[08:37] <monkey050> Silly computers.
[08:37] <monkey050> OK.
[08:37] <monkey050> Here is what the new kernel line reads on the regular boot:
[08:37] <jb0nd38372> diskus: I found a post, is this what your talking about specifically? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=58832  (scroll to the second post)
[08:38] <ThePub> frogzoo: There are far more rough edges in Ubuntu than XP from a desktop perspective.  Windows at least works on a fresh install on this machine, but Ubuntu has a hairy habit of randomly crashing (I know why, and I know how to solve it, but it's not user-friendly)
[08:38] <monkey050> "/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda2 ro quiet splash"
[08:38] <cmt^^> srf21c - sure am
[08:38] <monkey050> Do I try it now?
[08:38] <monkey050> Wait...
[08:38] <ArwynH> monkey050: yes. should be ok.
[08:38] <cmt^^> and ownership settings for the home-dir are correct
[08:38] <monkey050> Should root be (hd0,1)
[08:38] <ArwynH> monkey050: doesn't matter. /dev/hda2 will work
[08:38] <HymnToLife> monkey050, bot notations work
[08:39] <monkey050> Ok.  Time to press B!
[08:39] <monkey050> Staring Up...
[08:39] <monkey050> Ubuntu Logo....
[08:39] <monkey050> THE BAR IS ALIVE!
[08:39] <monkey050> WOOOO!
[08:39] <monkey050> Now to wait.
[08:39] <monkey050> Half way almost.
[08:39] <monkey050> 3/4
[08:39] <monkey050> bland screen...
[08:39] <srf21c> cmt:  so the file is in your homedir?
[08:39] <monkey050> DESKTOP!
[08:39] <monkey050> Logon screen!
[08:40] <canine_kouji> an advanced question about the ubuntu installer. Is there a way to have X NOT load?
[08:40] <monkey050> SUCCESS!
[08:40] <canine_kouji> and I don't want the minimal iso
[08:40] <canine_kouji> I want the desktop iso
[08:40] <cmt^^> srf21c - yep
[08:40] <srf21c> You can open the properties of the files via the gui, and get to the display tab?
[08:40] <jb0nd38372> monkey050: Great play by play, I can almost hear you typing in your user / pass :P
[08:40] <canine_kouji> the nvidia driver is freezing my machine
[08:40] <monkey050> Logging on...
[08:40] <monkey050> Logon sound...
[08:40] <monkey050> Desktop loading...
[08:40] <monkey050> Brown BG...
[08:40] <canine_kouji> the 6600GT 256MB card just makes it lock up when X starts loading
[08:40] <monkey050> And it's up.
[08:40] <canine_kouji> then its.. nothing, no keyboard, no mouse
[08:40] <monkey050> Score one for the Ubuntu guys!
[08:40] <arrenlex> canine_kouji: The alternative ISO is not "minimal", it's exactly the same CD except without X starting, just as you want. However, you might try safe graphics mode.
[08:40] <monkey050> You.  Are.  Awesome.
[08:41] <canine_kouji> arrenlex: tried that
[08:41] <monkey050> See?  It wasn't hopeless after all!
[08:41] <srf21c> canine:  try jamming the CTRL-ALT-BKSP key sequence several times when the gui loads..
[08:41] <canine_kouji> arrenlex: is there another way without downloading a new iso?
[08:41] <monkey050> I am so happy.
[08:41] <srf21c> sometimes that will drop you to a termninal
[08:41] <ArwynH> monkey050: if you don't want to keep changing things at boot, edit /boot/grub/menu.list and change all references of /dev/hdc2 to /dev/hda2
[08:41] <monkey050> Ok
[08:41] <monkey050> So it doesn't keep the settings in GRUB that I edited?
[08:42] <HymnToLife> actually, it's "menu.lst", not "list" ;)
[08:42] <arrenlex> canine_kouji: I haven't messed with the discs much, so I dunno.
[08:42] <cmt^^> srf21c - thought the CTRL+ALT+BKSP was for me 8)
[08:42] <monkey050> ok
[08:42] <ArwynH> HymnToLife: >_>
[08:42] <srf21c> cmt:  doh!
[08:42] <canine_kouji> mm
[08:42] <canine_kouji> there is an idea actually
[08:42] <monkey050> I was wondering about that, HymnToLife.
[08:42] <arrenlex> HymnToLife: By the same brilliant logic that makes the unmount command "umount" and thus completely unintuitive and impossible to guess.
[08:42] <monkey050> a 4 letter extension sounded weird.
[08:42] <canine_kouji> I could try repeatedly using alt-ctrl-bcksp
[08:42] <HymnToLife> monkey050, nope, each time GRUB starts, settings are loaded from /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:42] <monkey050> Cool.
[08:42] <canine_kouji> after 5 attempts or so it chokes
[08:42] <HymnToLife> arrenlex, agreed but that's the way it is
[08:42] <monkey050> I'll try that later.  At least I know what to do.
[08:43] <HymnToLife> just make your own distro with the file named menu.list ;)
[08:43] <monkey050> LOL!
[08:43] <monkey050> Ok.
[08:43] <ArwynH> monkey050: >3 letter extensions are common place in the unix world. :)
[08:43] <monkey050> Ah
[08:43] <monkey050> Ok
[08:43] <canine_kouji> I'd hate to ruin this new machien with windows xp
[08:43] <frogzoo> monkey050: you should also set groot properly in menu.lst, & check your devices.map - so it doesn't break on a future kernel upgrade
[08:43] <canine_kouji> core2 duo 2.4Ghz with 2 gig ram and 2 500GB WD enterprise drives :)
[08:43] <canine_kouji> a whole terrabyte
[08:43] <monkey050> I'll keep that in mind, but I'm pretty much a noob.
[08:44] <monkey050> I wouldn't know what to do with devices.map unless it was easy to read when i see it.
[08:44] <monkey050> Now, I can make a shortcut to the PPPoE thing on there, right?
[08:44] <glick> great firefox crashes again
[08:44] <monkey050> I managed to make PPPoE work on a Live CD of 5.10.
[08:44] <ThePub> glick: epiphany is your friend anyhow :D
[08:44] <monkey050> I just did a lot of looking around.  I was happy.
[08:45] <monkey050> I'm taking you guys' names down for future references.  Now I know who to talk to.
[08:45] <monkey050> You're awesome.
[08:45] <monkey050> Now, I do that GRUB editing in the terminal, right?
[08:45] <HymnToLife> not necessarily
[08:45] <monkey050> Where?
[08:46] <HymnToLife> you can do it in whichever text editor you like
[08:46] <monkey050> Oh right.  One of those.  lol
[08:46] <monkey050> Ok
[08:46] <fallingdutch> i have straces svn and when using hostname svn trys to connecto to port 0 but when using ip it trys to connect to port 3690 as supposed (ubuntu 6.10 amd64) can anyone proof that?
[08:46] <monkey050> Now, if I plug in my USB key will it recognize it or not?
[08:46] <srf21c> cmt:  If you know how to add a VNC host I could take a look see.  Feel like we're stuck on this one.
[08:46] <HymnToLife> monkey050, keyboard or USB memory stick ?
[08:47] <monkey050> USB sti..... POPUP!
[08:47] <ArwynH> open terminal and type, gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst to edit the grub file.
[08:47] <monkey050> It worked!
[08:47] <srf21c> anyone know of a command line video joiner tools for linux?   Need to patch together some pr0n, er uh, "video" files.  ;)
[08:47] <HymnToLife> lol I remember all the trouble I had to go through in FreeBSD to do just that
[08:47] <hive> Hey folks :)  Just a question, not really ubuntu-specific, but I figure someone here might be able to point me in the right direction..  Can somebody reccomend to me a pay-VPN service?  Something that will encapsulate all of my traffic...  I am currently using the free VPN at SecureIX, but I'd like something with consistent speeds and I don't mind paying for it.. Can someone point me in the right direction? :-)
[08:47] <monkey050> LOL.  Hymn, Ubuntu beat you to the answer!
[08:47] <diskus> jb0nd38372: naah, I have 19" monitor but I need more desktop area, and I remember that I tried somekind of virtual thing in the XFree86 abot 5 years ago, just trying to figure out if there is such a thing in X.org
[08:48] <monkey050> Now I want to active my corrupt windows partition so I can take a looksee at the files.  How how how?
[08:48] <HymnToLife> monkey050, you don't want to
[08:48] <monkey050> I read it a minute (hours) ago.  I vaguely remember already.
[08:48] <srf21c> hive:  If you're looking for privacy you can try metropipe.  Kinda off topic though
[08:48] <HymnToLife> mounting a corrupted partition can result in huge data loss
[08:48] <monkey050> I meant... the partition's not bad.
[08:48] <monkey050> Windows itself screwed up in a chkdsk.
[08:48] <jb0nd38372> diskus: ok, i'll keep looking,. i'm just sitting here in the channel anyway, trying to learn tips and tricks for when I mess something up, and i'm sure i will sooner or later :)
[08:48] <monkey050> So you can imagine why I put ubuntu on that laptop.
[08:49] <twb> fabbione: you are using the pxelinux.0 that ships with syslinux 3.11-3ubuntu2?
[08:49] <monkey050> The harddrive is completely good.
[08:49] <hive> srf21c: Thank you man.. I'll google it :^)
[08:49] <monkey050> If I wanted, I could have erased windows, but I know there's leftover files that chkdsk managed to NOT delete somehow.
[08:49] <monkey050> An old outtake of my band that broke up that makes me cry too.
[08:49] <monkey050> Friend came over and we found it using Knoppix.
[08:49] <monkey050> I want to listen to it again.
[08:49] <monkey050> I know the partitions are good.
[08:49] <monkey050> I meant Windows itself messed up.
[08:50] <srf21c> also anonyimizer has an ssh tunneling service.  But I wouldn't trust routing my traffic through any company located in the states these days.
[08:50] <diskus> jb0nd38372: no need, I think I found
[08:50] <monkey050> It's in System Admin right?
[08:50] <arrenlex> srf21c: apt-cache search join listed avifile-utils, which looks promising. However, those kinds of "videos" are usually mpeg, and apt-cache search join mpeg listed mpgtx, which also looks likely.
[08:50] <diskus> jb0nd38372: it's Virtual keyword in xorg.oconf
[08:50] <arrenlex> srf21c: In any case, apt-cache search is your friend. :)
[08:50] <molba> hy boys 'n' girls!
[08:50] <arrenlex> !hi
[08:50] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:50] <monkey050> And how come I only see 2 workspaces?
[08:50] <monkey050> No matter, I want to get to my Windows stuff.
[08:50] <srf21c> thanks arrenlex.   You know what would really be cool is a command line tool that converts wmw (windows media) files to a more usable format, like avi.
[08:51] <molba> :)
=== molba is now known as mobal
=== _rpc is now known as rpc
[08:51] <monkey050> Where do I activate my windows partition?
[08:51] <arrenlex> srf21c: There is one! mencoder -ovc lavc -oac lavc file.wmv -o file.avi =P
[08:51] <monkey050> To view in the browser thing?
[08:51] <jb0nd38372> diskus: ok, great, I think I may go have a look see, I'm having a minor issue with screen lock, and not recovering back to login screen (stays black) and ctrl-alt-bkspc does nothing..
[08:51] <frogzoo> !ntfs | monkey050
[08:51] <ubotu> monkey050: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[08:52] <arrenlex> srf21c: You will need mencoder and w32codecs for this.
[08:52] <Zober> Is there an svn system out there that does not require installation?  For example, if i want to host a repository on my site, but its a shared host with no shell privilages.
[08:52] <monkey050> Cool thanks.
[08:52] <srf21c> arrenlex:  rockin!  T'anks.  Already have w32codecs.  Will do some research on mencoder.
[08:52] <arrenlex> srf21c: apt-get install mencoder :)
[08:52] <arrenlex> srf21c: It's part of the venerable mplayer package. It can transcode from (but not to) any file mplayer can play.
[08:53] <monkey050> Alright, well I have to get to bed.
[08:53] <srf21c> you prefer apt-get over aptitude?  Been using aptitude mostly.  But found that apt-get tends to be more robust, when the going gets tough.
[08:53] <arrenlex> srf21c: That is, it's part of mplayer, not the package... the ubuntu devs separated them.
[08:53] <monkey050> You guys are great.  Thanks!
[08:53] <srf21c> I have mplayer installed.
[08:53] <glick> mmmm bedddd
[08:53] <glick> i still have to pack :/
[08:53] <monkey050> Lol.  Goodnight.
[08:53] <glick> and im beat
[08:54] <Commander-Crowe> http://pastebin.ca/278648
[08:54] <twb> fabbione: with 3.11-3ubuntu2, I get `unknown thingamy' for the GFXBOOT and GFXBOOT-BACKGROUND entries.
[08:54] <Commander-Crowe> I get that error om boot up
[08:54] <Commander-Crowe> on*
[08:54] <arrenlex> srf21c: I can't stand aptitude because it goes through "Reading extended state information", "Initializing package states... Done", and "Reading task descriptions... Done" every time, which slows it down.
[08:54] <uMISTA> whts the openssh client command
[08:54] <uMISTA> ?
[08:55] <arrenlex> srf21c: And it also offers completely random solutions whenever it doesn't like something, which typically consist of removing a dozen unrelated packages and do not solve the problem I was having, which annoys me incredibly.
[08:55] <srf21c> arrenlex:  Don't mince words.  Tell me how you *really* feel about aptitude.  :-B
[08:55] <arrenlex> srf21c: !language won't let me. :(
[08:55] <arrenlex> srf21c: Nah... it's not bad. Useful for its -t switch.
[08:56] <srf21c> cracking me up.   I had read several places about how aptitude supposedly had superior dependency handling capabilities.
[08:56] <glick> hey is there anyway to read dvds on the commandline?
[08:56] <arrenlex> srf21c: Those "capabilities" are essentially that it also installs recommended packages, rather than pure dependencies, so it fills your system with total crap you don't need.
[08:56] <glick> umm thats not what i meant
[08:56] <glick> i meant is there anyway to view pdfs on the commandline
[08:57] <twb> fabbione: OK, usplash comes up OK; I was just missing the `splash' kernel argument.
[08:57] <srf21c> arrenlex:   Ahh....that's the first I've heard of that issue.  Interesting..
[08:57] <Commander-Crowe> how do i edit /etc/fstab to revert away from uuid namings?
[08:57] <twb> I'd still like to get the GFXBOOT keyword working.
[08:57] <arrenlex> glick: "pdftotext" will extract the text from the pdf. Is this what you want?
[08:57] <cmt^^> srf21c - ok i've gotten it set up now
[08:57] <arrenlex> glick: "extract" -> "show" I guess, for clarity.
[08:58] <arrenlex> srf21c: It's not a bug, it's a feature. ;)
[08:58] <glick> arrenlex, just a commandline pdf reader
[08:58] <arrenlex> srf21c: Seriously, it's intentional.
[08:58] <glick> viewer
[08:58] <arrenlex> glick: I don't see how anything past extracting text is possible on a command line.
[08:59] <srf21c> arrenlex: Assuming everyone you say is true, what's the point of using aptitude at all?
[08:59] <srf21c> cmd:  be with you in a sec.
[08:59] <srf21c> er, cmt rather.  I'm a krappy typist.
[08:59] <srf21c> arrenlex:  "Assuming every*thing* you say is true"...my its getting late...
[09:00] <arrenlex> srf21c: Previously, because it kept track of what packages were installed as dependencies, so if you installed "foobar" and this also had to install "libfoobar" and "libsithblob-dev" and whatever, if you removed "foobar" with aptitude it would also remove libfoobar and libsithblob-dev. Apt wouldn't; you'd have to write it down somewhere or try to remember or just leave them there.
[09:00] <arrenlex> srf21c: But ubuntu's apt-get now keeps track of that via the "autoremove" feature.
[09:00] <arrenlex> srf21c: So what the point is NOW, I donut know.
[09:00] <srf21c> which reminds me, is there any decent speech recognition software for Ubuntu?  Want to get my inverse Stephen-Hawking on..
[09:00] <glick> arrenlex, yeah i guess your right
[09:00] <arrenlex> you;re
[09:00] <arrenlex> you're
[09:00] <arrenlex> xD
[09:01] <sc4ttrbrain> apt-get autoremove should do that imo :)
[09:01] <arrenlex> sc4ttrbrain: Yes, it does, as I was telling him.
[09:01] <sc4ttrbrain> oops
[09:01] <lovloss> Does Ubuntu have access to this "glib" file Ajunta IDE wants me to get? I seem to remember screwing up last time
[09:01] <srf21c> arrenlex:  When was apt-get updated to keep track of "autoremove" feature?  Last 6 months?
[09:01] <arrenlex> srf21c: I've been looking for such an application but I've yet to find one that works. Let me know.
[09:01] <frogzoo> srf21c: dragontalk can run under wine...
[09:02] <srf21c> What does this mean for the future of aptitude?
[09:02] <arrenlex> srf21c: I noticed it around the time edgy came out...
[09:02] <arrenlex> srf21c: But then I went back to debian because I hate ubuntu, and debian's doesn't have that. =(
[09:02] <arrenlex> srf21c: So it was back to the text file into which I paste things. xD
[09:02] <srf21c> frogzoo:  I have an old copy of Dragon Naturally Speaking...
[09:03] <frogzoo> !appdb | srf21c
[09:03] <ubotu> srf21c: Appdb is a database of apps & help for programs that run under wine: see http://appdb.winehq.org
[09:03] <lovloss> WHat packages should i get if im looking to work in c and c++? I looked up glib in apt-cache and found LOTS of libraries
[09:03] <mm2000> Hello our server at work suddenly just freezes, resulting that we have to push on the "mum-button", everything just stops, including samba and ssh, Any idea what i can monitor to find out what the problem is?
[09:03] <frogzoo> lovloss: 'sudo apt-get install build-essential' & done & done
[09:04] <arrenlex> lovloss: Just to compile? Or an entire IDE?
[09:04] <srf21c> arrenlex:  You hate Ubuntu, and you're hanging out on the #ubuntu IRC channel.   ???!!!
[09:04] <diskus> srf21c: tried http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/ already?
[09:04] <lovloss> arrenlex: im just trying to make Ajunta work :P
[09:04] <arrenlex> srf21c: Yes, to help people :)
[09:04] <arrenlex> srf21c: The #debian channel is full of arrogant jerks. I hate it there.
[09:04] <lovloss> frogzoo, i already have build essential
[09:05] <srf21c> discuss:  never heard of festival, thanks for the link.
[09:05] <arrenlex> lovloss: A junta? apt-get install pinochet =P what is ajunta? I've never heard of it.
[09:05] <arrenlex> srf21c: festival is text-to-speech IIRC.
[09:05] <diskus> srf21c: as far as I know it's very old, probably mature now
[09:05] <srf21c> arrenlex:  sounds reasonable.
[09:05] <frogzoo> lovloss: mebbe try 'apt-get source ajunta' ?
[09:05] <lovloss> couldnt find pinochet. Ajunta is a c/c++ IDE that comes in ubuntu's repositories. it asks for a "glib" file
[09:06] <srf21c> I'll be sure to use festival to make some pranks calls.  Thanks fellas. ;)
[09:06] <lovloss> frogzoo: i do have anjuta, its just not working
[09:06] <srf21c> cmt:  still there?
[09:06] <Pablo> where is this now? --> .In the file /etc/hotplug.usb.usermap
[09:06] <arrenlex> lovloss: Pinochet as a joke... chilean dictator... set up a junta... nevermind. xD
[09:06] <Pablo> I need to edit that file but i do not have
[09:06] <lovloss> lol
[09:06] <lovloss> Anjunta, its called
[09:06] <arrenlex> srf21c: Better hurry, skype's free calling in US&Canada ends soon!!
[09:07] <arrenlex> lovloss: You probably need libglib2.0-0
[09:07] <arrenlex> lovloss: And maybe libglib2.0-dev
[09:07] <srf21c> haha.   I know that's a bummer.  Maybe google dial will fill it's shoes.
[09:08] <lovloss> seems i had that
[09:08] <arrenlex> srf21c: I think google dial is something else... for small businesses, is it not?
[09:08] <arrenlex> lovloss: No? Maybe libglibmm-2.4-dev?
[09:09] <glick> anyone know of a good iptables tutorial?
[09:09] <lovloss> hah, now its asking for even more files. what a tedious little IDE
[09:10] <maggie> does anyone know where the config file for inetd resides?
[09:10] <srf21c> so looks like older versions of dragon naturally speaking are reasonably well supported under Wine.
[09:11] <maggie> most distros i can find it in /etc/inetd.conf i can't seem to locate it in ubuntu though
[09:11] <srf21c> maggie:  /etc/inetd.conf
[09:11] <srf21c> maybe you have to create a new one?
[09:11] <srf21c> mine is blank.
[09:11] <lovloss> seriously, is there *any* good graphical c/c++ program that ubuntu can easily run? Or do i just have to download a kazillion libraries
[09:11] <frogzoo> maggie: it's not there?
[09:12] <srf21c> try man update-inetd
[09:12] <maggie> frogzoo: no, i isn't there =(
[09:12] <arrenlex> lovloss: How about eclipse-cdt?
[09:12] <frogzoo> maggie: dapper or edgie?
[09:12] <somerville32> lovloss: Do you mean an IDE?
=== _greenie_ is now known as _greenie
[09:12] <maggie> edgy
[09:12] <lovloss> okay im trying out eclipse... and yes, an IDE. you know, with a compile button :)
[09:12] <srf21c> arrenlex:  don't know much about google dial other than there are supposedly some called ID issues that could lead to abuse.
[09:13] <frogzoo> maggie: wierd, it's there for me - anyways, /etc/inetd.conf is the correct path
[09:13] <lovloss> otherwise i have to type the compile command and THEN the run command over and over as i test stuff
[09:13] <Kachingo> Howdy, I just got given a scsi controller & 3 discs. Two of the discs are identical and are mounted in removable enclosures that monitor voltage, mtbf, temperature etc. When I plug all the discs in and go into the scsi controller bios, the identical drives appear as one disc. I assume this means they are configured for raid, but how do I delete the raid, so I can use both discs seperately?
[09:13] <frogzoo> lovloss: make
[09:14] <lovloss> i tried make, it gave me wierd messages about the libraries :P
[09:14] <lovloss> it was like "no, hello.c does not exist"
[09:14] <frogzoo> Kachingo: there'll be a management app - maybe for doze only
[09:15] <Kachingo> frogzoo: doze?
[09:15] <lovloss> when an apt-get reccomends and suggests packages, should you install them, or no?
[09:15] <frogzoo> Kachingo: win+doze
[09:15] <arrenlex> lovloss: You don't need them. They're just suggestions for things you might find interesting\relevant.
[09:15] <lovloss> gotcha
[09:16] <frogzoo> lovloss: if you have the space, sure
[09:16] <lovloss> this eclipse thing is an IDE?
[09:16] <Kachingo> frogzoo: ah, I see
[09:16] <frogzoo> !eclipse
[09:16] <ubotu> eclipse: Extensible Tool Platform and Java IDE. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.2.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 121 kB, installed size 412 kB
[09:16] <srf21c> alright everybody, I'm cashing out for tonight.  Appreciate all the help, esp: dabar and arrenlex.
[09:16] <lovloss> Java?
[09:16] <arrenlex> !eclipse-cde
[09:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about eclipse-cde - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:17] <arrenlex> Oh, that's cdt.
[09:17] <arrenlex> !eclipse-cdt
[09:17] <ubotu> eclipse-cdt: C/C++ Development Tools for Eclipse. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.0.1-3 (edgy), package size 17049 kB, installed size 21896 kB
[09:17] <arrenlex> :)
[09:17] <lovloss> ahhh
[09:17] <frogzoo> !eclipse-perl
[09:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about eclipse-perl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:17] <frogzoo> :(
[09:17] <lovloss> neat :3
[09:17] <arrenlex> lovloss: eclipse itself is a java ide by nature.
[09:18] <lovloss> You see, im president of a cute little video gamed company and i only know how to make an adlib program.
[09:18] <lovloss> so... i better get trucking
[09:18] <luca__> hi everyone
[09:18] <arrenlex> Bonjour, Jirya. Tu oublie? #ubuntu-fr =P
[09:19] <luca__> does anyone have experience about how to change successfully the graphics driver?
[09:19] <arrenlex> luca__: If you've not messed with your x config, you can run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and select a different driver.
[09:19] <lovloss> luca__: Beryl comes with the best driver ive ever had :)
[09:20] <lovloss> reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh is better
[09:20] <luca__> arrenlex, lovloss
[09:20] <arrenlex> luca__?
[09:21] <lovloss> luca__: ...?
[09:21] <arrenlex> Are we just saying random people's names for fun? xD
[09:21] <dope> what irc client do yall use
[09:21] <luca__> arrenlex, lovloss I have tried but the console says that the driver does not exist
[09:21] <luca__> dope konversation
[09:21] <lovloss> hmm
[09:21] <arrenlex> luca__: What driver is this?
[09:21] <dope> that's for kde isn't it
[09:21] <arrenlex> dope: Yes.
[09:21] <dope> what is gtk?
[09:22] <arrenlex> dope: A GUI toolkit.
[09:22] <Kachingo> would writing zeros to a hard drive destroy the raid configuration?
[09:22] <lovloss> Guys, i just installed this eclipse-cdt thing, but its not under my applications anywhere
[09:22] <luca__> arrenlex: i915 for intel
[09:22] <dope> so what would be the difference between bitchx and bitchx-gtk
[09:22] <luca__> dope gtk is the file manager substantially
[09:22] <Sub> Kachingo, depends if it is hardware or software RAID
[09:22] <Sub> hardware raid, no it wouldnt.
[09:22] <arrenlex> dope: It stands for "GIMP Toolkit", which in turn stands for "GNU Image Manipulation Program Toolkit" which in turn stands for "GNU's Not Unix Image Manipulation Program Toolkit", ad infinitum. :)
[09:23] <luca__> dope without gtk you use the default file browser....which is gtk in any case under gnome :-P
[09:23] <dope> oh
[09:23] <dope> so i guess bitchx is fine then
[09:23] <arrenlex> luca__: The file manager?! What? o__O
[09:23] <Kachingo> sub: what is the difference?
[09:23] <arrenlex> luca__: Gnome's file manager happens to be written in gtk, but so what?
[09:23] <Sub> dope, basically bitchx-gtk is a GUI version of bitchx
[09:23] <arrenlex> Sub: Brilliant. XD
[09:24] <lovloss> arrenlex  how do you use eclipse? its not in my applications :<
[09:24] <dope> ok
[09:24] <rausb0> why use bitchX, when there is irssi :)
[09:24] <maggie> weird, i have inetd running as a process but no inetd.conf file... synaptic shows inetd as not being installed....
[09:24] <Sub> Kachingo, well a hardware raid uses a RAID controller card to setup the raid- software raid is when you have two harddrives but you are using software to make the RAID
[09:24] <dope> what's so good about irssi?
[09:24] <Sub> rausb0, bitchx is just a collection of scripts for irssi....
[09:24] <Sub> basically.
[09:24] <Sub> its irssi at the core of it.
[09:25] <arrenlex> lovloss: the "eclipse" command doesn't exist?
[09:25] <rausb0> dope: also text mode, but much better usability. completion for almost everything, better window handling, ..
[09:25] <lovloss> arrenlex: you mean it doesnt have a gui?
[09:25] <arrenlex> lovloss: Of course it does. XD
[09:25] <dope> how do i run the bitchx-gtk?
[09:25] <arrenlex> lovloss: Just trying to help you find it.
[09:25] <lovloss> arrenlex: i cant find it in the a... wait, do i need to install just 'eclipse' too?
[09:25] <matthewrevell> join #launchpad
[09:26] <arrenlex> lovloss: I don't know... I've never used eclipse with c++. Ask on #eclipse maybe, they're really good.
[09:26] <lovloss> thank you ^o^
[09:26] <Kachingo> sub: ah I see, yeah it's hardware. It has a controller card.
[09:26] <rausb0> Sub: no. bitchX has nothing to do with irssi. bitchX _was_ a script collection for irc ii, which was turned into C code.
[09:27] <Sub> Kachingo, it should be okay - but like anything, backup to be sure
[09:27] <Sub> rausb0, ahh okay.
[09:28] <rausb0> Sub: AFAIK irssi shares no code with irc ii
[09:28] <Kachingo> sub: well, actually I'm trying to get rid of the raid. I can't work out how
[09:28] <Sub> hmm, does apt-get not keep logs? only aptitude?
[09:29] <maggie> yeah, irssi and irc ii are not the same.
[09:29] <maggie> oh... and bitchx blows =(
[09:29] <luca> anyone knowing something about i915?
[09:29] <Sub> Kachingo, you tried like "sudo /etc/init.d/mdadm stop " ?
[09:29] <Sub> im not sure, i think you would need a reinstall.
[09:30] <ddj> @luca: i915 .... you mean the graphics chip??
[09:30] <Sub> depends on the raid setup too - raid 0 for example you cant really jus "get rid" of the raid without loosing all the data
[09:31] <frogzoo> why do people say dapper is more stable than edgy? for me, edgy fixed everything that was annoying me
[09:32] <arrenlex> frogzoo: For me, edgy felt a lot slower than dapper. And broke a lot of things I had grown used to, like mp3 support. It drove me back to debian.
[09:32] <frogzoo> arrenlex: kde ?
[09:32] <arrenlex> frogzoo: Yes.
[09:32] <Kachingo> sub: it's not raid0. I guess the second drive is a clone or parity or something
[09:32] <arrenlex> frogzoo: Is that a sin or something now?
[09:32] <ddj> @frogzoo: Edgy has some annoying "features" too :)
[09:33] <dope> what's the best rss feed reader?
[09:33] <frogzoo> arrenlex: the gnome ugprade to 2.16 has been nothing but positive, huge speed gains
[09:33] <arrenlex> frogzoo: The people on #gaim were like, you're on KDE?! Oh it's not a gaim problem then, crawl back to the kinfestedhole you crawled from infidel.
[09:34] <frogzoo> arrenlex: well ubuntu is principally developed for gnome
[09:34] <arrenlex> frogzoo: I'm used to kde. It has everything and I love that. :) And the GUI is pretty -- GTK always felt a little soft around the edges for me, whatever theme I used.
[09:34] <tonyyarusso> dope: Depends what kind of feel you like.  I ended up not being entirely comfortable with any that I found, and so installed Planet on Apache :X
[09:34] <SouthernGrey> Can anyone help me out, I run Drake on a virtual machine off of XP and have forgotten my password after not using it for awhile.  Can any1 help get back in?
[09:34] <arrenlex> frogzoo: I was running kubuntu, which is principally developed for kde.
[09:34] <cypher1> does anyone know how to enable "direct rendering" on ATI Rage ?
[09:34] <frogzoo> arrenlex: touche
[09:34] <arrenlex> !password | SouthernGrey
[09:34] <ubotu> SouthernGrey: Forgot your password? Boot into recovery mode. What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
[09:35] <tonyyarusso> Wow.  That is an amazing factoid.
[09:35] <SouthernGrey> thanks friendly bot
[09:35] <cypher1> !thanks | SouthernGrey
[09:35] <ubotu> SouthernGrey: You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[09:35] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: Yes it is, and hallo. Did "password" set off some sort of flag? xD
[09:36] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: Nah, I'm always half-listening (/stalking)
[09:36] <arrenlex> *nod*
[09:36] <echosystm> guys, do you think its possible to make a computer silent?
[09:36] <echosystm> or
[09:36] <echosystm> like get it under 18dba at least
[09:36] <FreeNet> question SSL uses which port? is https and XXX.com:433 the same?
[09:36] <arrenlex> echosystm: Yes. Use a caseless setup.
[09:36] <echosystm> without water cooling of course
[09:36] <arrenlex> caseless -> fanless. Wow.
[09:36] <arrenlex> *tired*
[09:36] <echosystm> caseless?
[09:36] <echosystm> ahah
[09:37] <echosystm> yeah
[09:37] <echosystm> what im doing
[09:37] <cypher1> FredricR: do you mean ssh ?
[09:37] <tcli> FreeNet: 443, and yes
[09:37] <cypher1> FreeNet: do you mean ssh ? SSL is a protocol
[09:37] <echosystm> fanlesss psu, fanless video, harddrives mounted with rubber bands (lol) and a duct for the cpu fan
[09:37] <echosystm> so, only 1 fan
[09:37] <echosystm> should be ok right?
[09:37] <frogzoo> echosystm: you can run a fanless pc, or water cooling is very quiet
[09:37] <FreeNet> https is actually forwarded to port 433?
[09:37] <tcli> cypher: pretty sure he was talking about ssl encrypted web traffic
[09:38] <Albert> hello everybody
[09:38] <tcli> FreeNet: https://blah.com will go to port 443
[09:38] <tcli> not 433, 443 :P
[09:38] <nothlit> cypher1, so it http, doesn't mean it doesn't have a standard port
[09:38] <ddj> does anyone here experience their PS/2 keyboard freezing in Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy" ??
[09:38] <FreeNet> what if i am using dynamic url forwarding?
[09:38] <nothlit> Can you get a certificate for that?
[09:39] <cypher1> nothlit: ssl with http will have a specific port..
[09:39] <nothlit> cypher1, that's what I just said
[09:39] <echosystm> can anyone recommend a fanless PSU? all i can find are these crap FSP ones and Thermaltake 350w which are no longer available in AU :(
[09:39] <tcli> FreeNet: like mod_rewrite? ...the web browser actually handles that, but if the url is https:// it'll go to 443, http:// it'll go to 80... if you need to force it, you need to take a port on the end
[09:39] <cypher1> nothlit: sorry did not understood
[09:40] <tcli> FreeNet: mismatching protocols will generally yield garbage, or an error though (e.g. http://bob.com:443 or https://bob.com:80
[09:40] <FreeNet> can anyone try accessing xquest.dyndns.biz
[09:40] <FreeNet> and try it's https

[09:46] <abuyazan> i need software to create CD cover to stick on the CD
[09:46] <hdibani> i asked a question on solaris channel

[09:46] <hdibani> 30 minutes but no answer
[09:46] <FreeNet> yes.. thanks for the test
[09:48] <Albert_> Hello, i have a problem with my cpu temp he is cold -116 ; http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36963/ ; have you an idea ? thks
[09:49] <nothlit> lol thats impossible
[09:50] <abuyazan> yes it seems it is what i need
[09:50] <abuyazan> thanks all
[09:50] <hdibani> HAHAHA i would like to have that
[09:51] <uMISTA> i have to nic's one for lan and one connector to a internet router. how would i setup to the dhcp to go though the sec nix to internet router?

[09:53] <flasher222> how can i check whether my audio is set to also OR to oss?
[09:54] <arrenlex> flasher222: Your audio isn't "set to" anything -- applications themselves can choose which to use.
[09:54] <flasher222> arrenlex: oh
[09:54] <arrenlex> flasher222: Unless you've changed something in your setup, your audio is alsa with oss emulation.
[09:55] <flasher222> arrenlex: i ask because I'm using noteedit (a musical score editor) , and when i play back the score/sheet via timidity playback, it sounds bad
[09:55] <arrenlex> flasher222: "bad"?
[09:55] <avis> i've got a broken face
[09:55] <flasher222> arrenlex: like scratchy
[09:56] <arrenlex> flasher222: maybe you're just no mozart? =P
[09:56] <flasher222> arrenlex: no, i don't mean the piece as a whole.
[09:56] <flasher222> i'm talking about the audio quality
[09:56] <arrenlex> flasher222: Do normal midis play fine in timidity? Which instruments package are you using?
[09:56] <flasher222> arrenlex: well, yes, midis play fine with timidity.
[09:57] <arrenlex> flasher222: What's the difference between what plays fine and what plays scratchy?
[09:57] <flasher222> arrenlex: although i wish i do not see any messages which say "Will not play instrumnent XXX"
[09:57] <Kachingo> if I boot into ubuntu with only one of two raid drives connected, will the operationg system see it?
[09:57] <uMISTA> if i have eth0(dhcp server) has setting of gateway (which is pointed to eth1) would this work. (eth1 is connected to internet connection?)
[09:57] <flasher222> arrenlex: just to clarify. when I said "via timidity playback", i meant inside noteedit.
[09:57] <arrenlex> flasher222: ...I see.
[09:58] <flasher222> any midi i play in timidity itself (e.g. timidity foo.mid) is fine
[09:58] <arrenlex> flasher222: What happens if you "export" a midi from noteedit and play that midi in timidity? If that's possible?
[09:58] <flasher222> arrenlex: yes it is. it sounds fine
[09:59] <flasher222> i've exported only one voice (Tenor). I'll try exporting all voices
[09:59] <arrenlex> flasher222: Then I would be digging through the noteedit settings if I were you... I'm not familiar with any of the applications or theory involved, so I can't help you much.
[09:59] <flasher222> but while i try that, let me ask you a question. You asked me "Which instruments package are you using?" My question to you is: what options do i have? Which is the best?
[09:59] <arrenlex> flasher222: I've only used timidity for playing random Jethro Tull midis I've found.
[10:00] <arrenlex> flasher222: Uh... on ubuntu, AFAIK the only one is freepats, no? Software, I mean.
[10:00] <uMISTA> can i blind the dhcp server onto eth0 and not eth1?
[10:00] <flasher222> So you mean to ask me what instrument software package i'm using?
[10:00] <arrenlex> flasher222: Yes.
[10:00] <BlackHawk> hi
[10:01] <arrenlex> !hi
[10:01] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[10:01] <flasher222> um, i'm not sure i understand your question. maybe if you answer the question first, i'll understand.
[10:01] <arrenlex> flasher222: xD Nevermind. As I say, I'm not familiar with midis or how they work.
[10:01] <sushi_> Hey I want .ICO files to have thumbnails in Nautilus.  How is this possible?
[10:02] <flasher222> arrenlex: thanks
[10:03] <magic_ninja> i am having an azureus problem, but its a java error, i think i have 2 different java versions installed
[10:04] <arrenlex> magic_ninja: "a problem" and "I think it's an error" aren't very helpful... can you be more specific?
[10:05] <magic_ninja> arrenlex: yea, mainly just makin sure someone's here.
[10:05] <magic_ninja> arrenlex: I have a log file I can pm you, but not sure where its at, do you know where the JRE saved error logs
[10:05] <arrenlex> magic_ninja: There are 827 people in this channel. There are always people here.
[10:05] <arrenlex> magic_ninja: Not me, I have to go. :) Good luck, though.

[10:06] <kishan> can any one help If I hibernate, it overwrites my swap and doesn't restore my session on the next boot. I then have to go through the steps of fixing my swap
[10:07] <Russel> hiho
[10:07] <Russel> i got a little problem here:
[10:07] <Russel> i use a livecd and chroot into my normal installation
[10:07] <Russel> but in the chroot i do not have a name resolving
[10:08] <Kachingo> Howdy, I have two scsi drives that only work when both are connected, and only appear as a single drive in the scsi controller bios. But they don't appear as a raid array, and it won't let me delete the raid, because it thinks the two discs actually are the same. When I boot into ubuntu with the discs connected, the mouse and keyboard don't work. What should I do to get these drives working independant of each other?
[10:08] <Russel> i copied the names from the resolv.conf of the livecd
[10:11] <leagris> Kachingo did you check it is not an SCSI chain terminator issue?

[10:11] <magic_ninja> where does java store its error log files
[10:12] <ddj> @NINJA: Depends on the application .....   e.g. azureus puts them in ~/.azureus/
[10:13] <Wiseguy> hey guys whats the best gui CD/DVD burning app for .img and .iso's?
[10:13] <ddj> k3b
[10:14] <Wiseguy> does k3b support DVD's?
[10:14] <nothlit> if you want to stay within gnome applications you can choose gnomebaker or brasero
[10:14] <Kachingo> leagris: perhaps it is. I don't know a huge amount about scsi. How would I check that?
[10:15] <KenSentMe> I have updated profptd on my ubuntu dapper machine, but since that i get an error when restarting proftpd: IPv6 getaddrinfo 'marge2.lan' error: Name or service not known.I've read the README.debian file about adding '::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback your_host_name' and '::fff:A.B.C.D your_host_name'. The server restarts without error, but is unreachable through an ftp client. Anyone know a solution?
[10:15] <ddj> @NOTHLIT: yes it does ...  it actually depends if all the right tools are installed (cdrecord, dvd+rw tools, etc.)
[10:16] <nothlit> ddj, ehh k3b has the same dependencies?
[10:16] <ddj> @NOTHLIT: what do you mean with "same dependencies" ?
[10:17] <Wiseguy> ddj, do you know if k3b does DVD images as well?
[10:17] <nothlit> ddj, uses the same backends
[10:17] <leagris> Kachingo, an SCSI chain is a single channel(cable) starting from the SCSI card thouch te connected devices (disks) and ending with e terminator (line resistors). Either a terminator is plugged after the last disk in the chain or the last disk has a jumber enabling an internal terminator. You should check only the last disk get internal terminator enabled or neither but an external terminator
[10:18] <sushi_> Hey I want .ICO files to have thumbnails in Nautilus.  How is this possible?
[10:18] <ddj> @WISEGUY: I burn my DVD ISO's all the time with k3b so I am pretty sure the answer is "yes" :)
[10:19] <pfhomer> Yo! Now, I am probably a moron (with a computer science masters), but I can't seem to find the Ubuntu live cd????
[10:19] <avis> good morning
[10:19] <leagris> Kachingo, You should also check no devices in the chain get the same SCSI ID. Usually cards default to ID7. First disk may have ID1, next ID3. Order of IDs in the chain don't matter. Ensure none have the same ID.
[10:19] <avis> its on your bookshelf ;)
[10:19] <pfhomer> thanks!
[10:19] <pfhomer> :)
[10:20] <bigbro> pfhomer: It's probably just well hidden - like the mini.iso image :-)  Are you looking to download a copy? If so, just grab the default CD from ubuntu.com
[10:20] <pfhomer> avis, really... is the "normal" iso image also the live image, or...? Why isn't the ubuntu home page more clear about where to find the live cd?
[10:20] <bigbro> pfhomer: There is no longer a distinction between the live and install CD - one CD does both.
[10:20] <pfhomer> bigbro, ok!
[10:21] <bigbro> pfhomer: Grab the alternative CD installer ISO if your computer is old / has less than 256MB RAM (I know they say 192MB, but I had issues with less than about 256)
[10:21] <cwillu> I can't get any audio cd's to play;  sound juicer comes up, shows the track listings, but hangs with 100% cpu at 2 seconds, with no sound
[10:21] <pfhomer> bigbro, I have to boot from cd on a machine with a wrecked windows installation. I cant install anything to hd. I just want to boot on the cd, mount his hd, get the wireless network up and runnning (hopefully easy from the live cd), and then transfer all his important files to another machine over the net
[10:22] <avis> pfhomer, i'm not sure i use the altenate text based cd.  i was trying to track down a live cd url for you but they it seems apache under linux does not display entire filenames
[10:22] <cwillu> pfhomer: might want to look at knoppix;  it's designed a bit more for that usage
[10:22] <avis> pfhomer, you can look at www.ubuntu.com and check out download it
[10:22] <pfhomer> bigpro it is a laptop with a P4 3GHz and 512 MB RAM
[10:22] <nothlit> Anyone know what's the difference between the default entry in menu.lst and the default you set with grub-set-default?
[10:22] <bigbro> pfhomer: JUst grab the normal CD then - should do the job nicely
[10:22] <pfhomer> cwillu, sure, but knoppix is a damn dvd these days. a huge download
[10:23] <pfhomer> bigbro, cool, thanks
[10:23] <magic_ninja> ok i found the problem I think
[10:23] <infobash> why is finding codecs etc such a mission?
[10:23] <magic_ninja> I have 2 different versions of java....
[10:24] <avis> its not if you read the restricted formats wiki
[10:24] <magic_ninja> how do you remove one version of java without messing them both up
[10:24] <Infeliz> why here is 0 ops
[10:25] <infobash> avis: got a link
[10:25] <avis> Infeliz, they dont want people to think they are watching over the channel so they sneak up behind you and nab you when your misbehaving.
[10:25] <Kachingo> leagris: The chain has a terminator plugged at the end. Does having scsi drives of different standards (scsi2 & scsi3) connected on the same chain stuff it up?
[10:25] <cwillu> Infeliz: there are ops around, they're just not advertising themselves
[10:25] <Infeliz> okay
[10:26] <avis> the community contributed link on the default ubuntu start page should take you to a place you can find it
[10:26] <kraut> moin
[10:26] <leagris> Kachingo, it should not be a problem because the devices are bus compatible and the card talks either SCSI dialect to them.
[10:26] <ubox> hey all

[10:29] <Kachingo> leagris: Also, how does one set the ID? Because the two drives I'm having problems with have removable enclosures that monitor temp, fan, voltage, mtbf, etc. It also appears that you can set the scsi ID on the display of the enclosure. There is also a dial at the back of the enclosure that turns & is marked 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-A-B-C-D-E-F

[10:34] <halorgium> evening
[10:34] <halorgium> i'm trying to boot from a usb stick
[10:34] <halorgium> i'm following the wiki instructions
[10:34] <gharz> guys, what's the equivalent command of defrag in linux?
[10:34] <halorgium> there isn't one
[10:34] <gharz> i want to defragment my hd
[10:34] <halorgium> you can do fsck
[10:35] <cwillu> gharz: shouldn't need to with most partition types
[10:35] <gharz> cwillu, ok...
[10:35] <gharz> thanks for the info.
[10:35] <nothlit> gharz, you don't need to for a year or two
[10:35] <halorgium> fsck isn't a "defrag"
[10:35] <echosystm> if youre using ext3 your filesystem wont really f*ck itself like a windows drive will gharz
[10:35] <echosystm> :)
[10:35] <nothlit> halorgium, there is but really linux filesystems are almost self defragging
[10:35] <Infeliz> u dont need defrag ext3/2 etc
[10:36] <halorgium> nothlit: i know :)
[10:36] <gharz> thanks for the info guys
[10:36] <cwillu> why do you suppose I can rip a cd, but I can't just play it?
[10:36] <halorgium> now, why doesn't my edgy usb disk not boot? :(
[10:36] <echosystm> no cdda support?
[10:36] <cwillu> elaborate?
[10:37] <nothlit> halorgium, you said there isn't one
[10:37] <echosystm> what prog are you using the play the cd?
[10:37] <cwillu> sound juicer, rhythm box, etc
[10:37] <halorgium> nothlit: oh, right. thought you were on about 'fsck isn't a defrag"
[10:37] <cwillu> I get a hang after about 2 seconds, no audio to begin with
[10:37] <echosystm> hmm ok
[10:38] <echosystm> i cant really help
[10:38] <Amelik> hello..  I need to configure a bridge on ubuntu... can someone help me?
[10:38] <Kachingo> leagris: Turning the dial does change the ID. However, the two drives still appear as one even when their ID's are different. There is also a thing on the digital display that says ID, but when I change it nothing happens
[10:38] <cwillu> tried a different cd, same thing
[10:38] <echosystm> but mp3s etc play ok?
[10:38] <cwillu> echosystm: yep
[10:38] <echosystm> weird
[10:38] <echosystm> i have no idea man, sorry
[10:38] <cwillu> :/
[10:40] <Kachingo> leagris: It detects only one drive, and displays it's ID. But if one of the drives is disconnected, neither works.
[10:41] <leagris> Kachingo, New IDs should appear after a bus reset (either system reset). If not the ID switchs may not be plugged to the disk inside the enclosure.
[10:42] <CyaNox> Where do I report broken packages for feisty? libapache2-mod-python is broken.
[10:42] <cwillu> CyaNox: what's wrong?

[10:46] <cwillu> looking;  sorry, didn't see the first response
[10:47] <leagris> CyaNox, sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-python2.4
[10:47] <echosystm> whats faster, a geforce4 ti4400 or an FX5200 ?
[10:48] <nothlit> dsdg, production you should go with dapper
[10:48] <lardarse> 5200... but get 1 with a fan
[10:48] <MacMatt> anyone with any linux-mac experience ?
[10:48] <echosystm> im actually looking to get one without a fan :P
[10:48] <cwillu> CyaNox: edgy you said?  it pulls libapache2-mod-python2.4 on my system if I select it
[10:48] <lardarse> aaah...
[10:49] <CyaNox> leagris: Package libapache2-mod-python2.4 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[10:49] <echosystm> its cheaper for me to buy a new card than to get a heatpipe for my gf4
[10:49] <CyaNox> cwillu: no feisty

[10:50] <MisterE> am I missing a white elephant?
[10:50] <lardarse> but it's put me off buying any gfx card without a fan
[10:50] <echosystm> how about radeon 9250 ?
[10:51] <lardarse> echosystm: but YMMV
[10:51] <echosystm> this pc is used in a music studio
[10:51] <Narada> guys; am i write in thinking that when i do update-alternatives --config java and then select one that it is only selecting the `java` binary and not the other 20-25 java related binaries?  because if that is so that is quite retarded
[10:51] <kling0n> MisterE: what do you mean?
[10:51] <echosystm> so it has to be quiet as
[10:51] <fallingdutch> is anyone here using svn on Ubunut6.10 amd64?

[10:51] <CyaNox> so leagris, cwillu I'm basicly stuck till I either compile it myself or to when?
[10:51] <echosystm> rightyo
[10:51] <cwillu> CyaNox: just grab the 2.4 deb from edgy
[10:51] <leagris> CyaNox, here it is http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/edgy/python/libapache2-mod-python2.4
[10:51] <lardarse> echosystm: aaah, i see, in that case, a 5200 should be fine
[10:52] <cwillu> CyaNox: are you doing development on fiesty?
[10:52] <lardarse> maybe even the 4400 or the 9250
[10:52] <MisterE> kling0n: what application does it excel most at other than a high-load server I can't make it work in my brai
[10:52] <lardarse> i'm honestly not sure
[10:52] <_raphael_> is there a repo with openoffice 2.1?
[10:52] <lardarse> but if you're not gaming on it, then you don't need to have a "gaming" card
[10:52] <kling0n> MisterE: well... the most fundamental thing for me is, once you've configured your system, it *stays* configured
[10:53] <kling0n> MisterE: and I can make stuff behave the way I like it
[10:53] <MisterE> hmm
[10:53] <buitenzorg812_> what is lubuntu?
[10:53] <kling0n> MisterE: but are you comparing this to windows or osx?
[10:54] <kling0n> MisterE: compared to windows, it should be a no-brainer for most regular users... a Desktop environment that works and does not bother you with popups or viruses
[10:54] <MisterE> os x is my prefered platform I'll get that out in the open up front
[10:54] <Infeliz> loser buntu
[10:54] <MisterE> don;t speak the evil win word
[10:54] <kling0n> MisterE: If you are happy with osx, I wouldnt change
[10:54] <MisterE> no but I keep hearing ubuntu this and that and it's all the rage
[10:54] <MisterE> but I can't figure what Im missing
[10:54] <Vernaldo> OS X is frustrating
[10:55] <MisterE> I mean even comapred to other distros
[10:55] <kling0n> MisterE: but once you've banged your head into stuff that "can't be done" because someone else decided it was bad for you a sufficient number of times, come to the lnux world :)
[10:55] <ddj> @MisterE: If you are happy with OS X .... don't bother with anything else :-)
[10:55] <Vernaldo> OS X is limiting
[10:55] <MisterE> what sets it apart from red had, frdora, debian, yellow dog let alone os x
[10:55] <kling0n> what Vernaldo said :)
[10:55] <MisterE> limiting?
[10:55] <kling0n> hehe long discussion
[10:55] <Vernaldo> using OS X is expensive
[10:56] <ddj> @MisterE:  to each his own
[10:56] <MisterE> it's got all the goodness of a *nix with the best gui a *nix will ever get
[10:56] <kling0n> MisterE: basically, ubuntu edgy is a more "current" package set than the server editions of ubuntu as well as the other distros..
[10:56] <MisterE> how's the device drivers?
[10:56] <kling0n> MisterE: then' there is a fair bit about how much work is ndone on customizing the desktop for the individual distro
[10:56] <kling0n> MisterE: and the quite a bit of general preference :=)
[10:56] <Vernaldo> the finder is too basic a file manager. Even nautilus has more power for some things, and it doesn't even come close to konqueror.
[10:57] <kling0n> MisterE: that is practically identical across all the distros... the kernel is the same kernel tree
[10:57] <MisterE> seriously guys no one who knows their way around a cli uses finder
[10:57] <Vernaldo> you cannot browse others' files from the file manager, finer won't let you. It won't ask for password or anything.
[10:57] <Narada> what do i add to sources.lst to get the new java 6
[10:57] <ddj> @MisterE:  Red Hat: too proprietary for my taste; Fedora: limited package selection (Ubuntu has 21000 packages to choose from!), Yellow Dog: Is for PPC only, not for Intel machines so I can't know it / Debian: Not friendly enough for me.  / SUSE: Novell sucks. I just replaced all my SUSE installations with Debian or Ubuntu ....
[10:58] <kling0n> MisterE: I use Freebsd on servers, and have used it o desktops too... but I prefer unbuntu for desktop stuff
[10:58] <MisterE> hmm
[10:58] <MisterE> 21k packages the mind bogles
[10:58] <Vernaldo> MisterE: well, if you put it like that, then they're both on equal ground. No wait, BSD/linux still wins.
[10:58] <choongii> http://www.pcbsd.org/ :)
[10:58] <MisterE> I can't see how you guys feel limited in os x though
[10:58] <dneary> Hi
[10:58] <MisterE> I know you're used to saving cash but you get what you pay for no?
[10:58] <choongii> I'd love a mac, but they're so expensive ~_~
[10:58] <nothlit> isn't osx limited?
[10:59] <dneary> Any idea which bot generates the IRC logs for this and the other Ubuntu channels?
[10:59] <MisterE> maybe you don't like it "Steve's way" I can dig that
[10:59] <kling0n> MisterE: if your brain works like the mac devs think it does, it's fine.... (and a very nice, well thought out gui it is too!) but once you start wanting to change fundamental parts of it, you simply can't
[10:59] <Vernaldo> ddj: why do you say SUSE sucks? (technical reasons, not microsoft ones please)
[10:59] <Infeliz> mac expensive, are u poor?
[10:59] <choongii> Infeliz, I'm a student, so, yes, I am very poor
[10:59] <kling0n> suse is great for server installs
[10:59] <Infeliz> heh
[10:59] <hdibani> SLED is good for desktop too
[10:59] <kling0n> i'd buy a mac book for the hardware :)
[11:00] <Vernaldo> MisterE: I've spent over 1,500 only in software in the last six months
[11:00] <ddj> @Vernaldo:  Try to upgrade something ... something harmless. It can totally ruin your system! Happened to me several times. And one day I decided: enough is enough.
[11:00] <kling0n> and then put on ubuntu :)
[11:00] <MisterE> mac is no more expensive than a similarly equipped dell box but I kow you all are probably building your own
[11:00] <Vernaldo> MisterE: just on OSX
[11:00] <CyaNox> thanks leagris, cwillu ... it works now.
[11:00] <MisterE> I'm on a macbook kling0n
[11:00] <ootput> g'day folks. I came across two scripts that automated codec installation, graphics driver installation etc, but I've forgotten what they were called. Also, can any of you offer input on either of these, making mention of advantages and pitfalls?
[11:00] <ddj> automatix
[11:00] <kling0n> !automatix
[11:00] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[11:00] <leagris> Vernaldo, SUSE is RPM based and it was neat in the 90'. Now it is a pain even with yast.
[11:00] <Vernaldo> kling0n: the moment I find someone that can hint me through the process, I'll do it.
[11:01] <kling0n> leagris: yeah.. rpm is a pita
[11:01] <Magilla> !WorksForMe
[11:01] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[11:01] <Vernaldo> kling0n: the problem is that ubuntu livecd chokes on this mac's video card.
[11:01] <ddj> @LEAGRIS:  dito !! SUSE is nice for as long as you don't dare to install packages that were not shipped on their DVD ...
[11:01] <ootput> ddj, kling0n: what's the name of the other one?
[11:01] <MisterE> how could you spend $1500 on mac os x software?
[11:01] <kling0n> ootput: easyubuntu
[11:01] <ddj> easyubuntu
[11:01] <kling0n> Vernaldo: can't you do a CLI install?
[11:01] <ddj> ha, same thought, same time ... LOL
[11:01] <kling0n> ddj: faster fingers :P
[11:01] <ootput> !easyubuntu
[11:01] <ubotu> easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[11:02] <MisterE> you guys are students and probably cs majors to boot when you get into the business world you will have to make a choice unless you land a sys admin gig at a server farm / isp or whatever
[11:02] <Vernaldo> kling0n: it chokes at the CLI!
[11:02] <Kachingo> leagris: Cool, I messaged you in the private convo
[11:02] <kling0n> Vernaldo: is it ppc or intel??
[11:02] <Vernaldo> kling0n: not even the CLI comes up right. The screen gets unreadable.
[11:02] <sushi_> How do I move a window into another virtual desktop?  Thanks
[11:02] <Vernaldo> intel
[11:02] <eeos>  I would like to install ubuntu from the net, on a pc with broadband, where there is already another distribution, but where we do not have floppy or cdrom. ho can I do it? can I do it from the iso?
[11:03] <Vernaldo> single core
[11:03] <eeos> I read the documetation, but did not find an appropriate install method
[11:03] <kling0n> Vernaldo: and do you have any peripherals that you could disconnect during the install ?
[11:03] <MisterE> yay internet back up at mae west
[11:03] <Vernaldo> vid card is intel 950 (which I've learned is troublesome on ubuntu)
[11:03] <kling0n> eeos: PBX
[11:03] <kling0n> eeos: sorry PXE boot
[11:03] <eeos> kling0n PBX?
[11:03] <ootput> eeos: any other pc's close by that one?
[11:03] <sushi_> eeos: use the live cd-rom, it'll have everything you need
[11:03] <leagris> Kachingo, don't see you
[11:03] <ootput> eeos: can do a remote install through netboot
[11:03] <Zaggynl> Hi, I'm trying to play a flv file, I tried VLC and mplayer, both crap out :(
[11:04] <buscon> Hi, how can I made an ubuntu mirror on a debian system?
[11:04] <Zaggynl> ffmpeg cannot conver either: ' [flv @ 0x82c8a80] Unsupported video codec (4)'
[11:04] <eeos> sushi_  just told you I can't
[11:04] <ootput> Zaggynl: dev mplayer works for me
[11:04] <ootput> self-compiled
[11:04] <eeos> kling0n what is PXE boot
[11:04] <kling0n> Zaggynl: go look for the "dirty" codecs
[11:04] <Zaggynl> I have the win32 codecs
[11:04] <eeos> ootput how does that work? can I do it from the repository?
[11:04] <Narada> hi; how do i remove a .deb package installed via dpkg -i?
[11:04] <ddj> Zaggy ... and if you convert it to DIVX?
[11:04] <kling0n> eeos: http://wiki.koeln.ccc.de/index.php/Ubuntu_PXE_Install
[11:05] <Narada> can you just do dpkg --remove?
[11:05] <kling0n> Zaggynl: try it with mplayer
[11:05] <Zaggynl> I tried mplayer too
[11:05] <jokoon> I'm having a problem described on http://www.ubuntu.com/FixForUpgradeIssue Is it normal that I was having 6.10 when the problem is described to have happenned in august on the 6.06 ?
[11:05] <ddj> @ZAGGY:  mencoder YourFile.flv
[11:05] <ddj> -oac mp3lame -lameopts preset=standard -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=1231:mbd=1:lumi_mask=0.5:scplx_mask=0.1:

[11:06] <Zaggynl> :o
[11:06] <ddj> ah sorry .... should all be one line
[11:06] <eeos> kling0n it looks like you need a serer, you do cannot do it from the main repository.
[11:06] <MisterE> nastyness welp each to his own take care ubuntu_people
[11:06] <eeos> kling0n serer = server
[11:06] <kling0n> do you ahve any other machines on the local network?
[11:06] <kling0n> have
[11:06] <ddj> @ZAGGY: it will convert anything into a nice sweet DIVX (*.avi) file ...
[11:06] <Zaggynl> hmm okay
[11:07] <kling0n> ddj not if it can't decode the original file
[11:07] <sushi_> How do I move a window into another virtual desktop?  Thanks
[11:07] <kling0n> sushi_: right click the title bar :)
[11:07] <ddj> OK, of course. If the original file is corrupt or cannot be read due to some missing codecs ... oh well. :)
[11:07] <eeos> kling0n another one
[11:07] <kling0n> Vernaldo: does your mac book have a serial port?
[11:07] <kling0n> eeos: running linux or windows?
[11:08] <kling0n> ddj: ... which puts him back where he started :)
[11:08] <eeos> kling0n linux of course :P (mandriva 2007)
[11:08] <Vernaldo> kling0n: just USB
[11:08] <kling0n> eeos: in that case, you should be able to follow the link
[11:08] <ddj> hmmm ... well ..... at least I tried, no? :)
[11:09] <eeos> kling0n cannot use that machine, it is a production machine used the whole day, that is the reason because I need to install from the repository if possible
[11:09] <kling0n> eeos basically, you set up the directory structure of the install cd, activate tftp for that dir and configure dhcpd to look for BOOTP requests
[11:09] <Jurgeni> is it a common problem that firefox is really slow if there are pages with flash open?
[11:09] <eeos> kling0n yes, I did understand the procedure
[11:10] <kling0n> Vernaldo: have you tried booting a knoppix or other livecd?
[11:10] <Narada> guys am i missing something or is java6 on edgy?
[11:10] <eeos> kling0n but the point is I cannot use it :(
[11:10] <Vernaldo> kling0n: no, not really.
[11:10] <kling0n> Vernaldo: if you can find one that will boot, you should be able to use that interface to get ubuntu on the machine :)
[11:10] <Vernaldo> kling0n: I tried ubuntu, because there is a special ubuntu livecd for macintels
[11:10] <Vernaldo> kling0n: the special ubuntu cd already includes bios tweaks through refit to make it boot
[11:11] <kling0n> eeos: well... if you dont have floppy, dont have cd and can't set up pxe boot you cant really do  a lot
[11:11] <Vernaldo> so, no, I have not tried other livecds. I didn't even consider trying, due to all the BIOS muhaha
[11:11] <kling0n> Vernaldo: use that livecd to do the install then
[11:11] <eeos> kling0n but I have broadband connection, so I imagine I can do a netboot pointing to the main respository.
[11:12] <kling0n> eeos: netbooting requires the serving machine to be on same local net segment
[11:12] <stephan21> !ipaq
[11:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ipaq - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:12] <kling0n> eeos: it runs on raw ethernet frames
[11:12] <eeos> kling0n that is the problem I could not solve, so this is the reason why I contacted the chat!
[11:12] <stephan21> can someone tell me how to sync my ipaq to linux
[11:12] <kling0n> eeos: i'm sorry for you, but it can't be done
[11:12] <eeos> kling0n I thought there was an equivalent for the internet
[11:13] <eeos> kling0n :(
[11:13] <genesis[OFT] > Hi guys - Can anyone help me with a problem with BIND\DNS?
[11:13] <kling0n> eeos: the PXE code is part of the bios.. it cant be updated to be fancier...
[11:13] <SuMarDi> hello there
[11:13] <Vernaldo> kling0n: my speed is dialup
[11:13] <kling0n> eeos: which is pretty much a good thing (TM) since I wouldnt run the risk of my machine booting some strange install from the internet
[11:14] <SuMarDi> anyone has a modem smartlink driver for kernel 2.6.17-10?
[11:14] <kling0n> Vernaldo: :( do you have flatrate?
[11:14] <Vernaldo> yes
[11:14] <kling0n> Vernaldo:  then it is potentially a question of patience :)
[11:14] <Vernaldo> unlimited always on flatrate, at dialup speed
[11:14] <Vernaldo> ha. ha.
[11:14] <Vernaldo> *sigh*
[11:15] <kling0n> Vernaldo: or you could boot the livecd that works, eject it, mount the install dis and try  going from there
[11:15] <kling0n> dis=disc
[11:15] <genesis[OFT] > there any DNS\BIND gurus out there?
[11:15] <eeos> kling0n but I would like to be able to chose where my machine boots from.
[11:15] <kling0n> Vernaldo: I just got my 10mbit/512kbit line  a month ago :P
[11:16] <kling0n> eeos: the protocol only supports ethernet frames for the bootp request.... it does not speak tcp/ip
[11:16] <Infeliz> does I have to register my nickname in this FreeNode -network?
[11:16] <Vernaldo> I'm officialy on broadband, because it's through cable modem, but the speed is 64kpbs
[11:16] <Infeliz> Do
[11:16] <kling0n> Vernaldo: try the disc-changing strategy
[11:16] <kling0n> Vernaldo: lol
[11:16] <Vernaldo> kling0n: will do. I will try knoppix and others.
[11:17] <eeos> kling0n what I thought, was to download something like a booter, point grub to it, reboot the mchine, and the machine looding the booter, connectig and dowloading/ installing the rest
[11:17] <kling0n> eeos: hmm
[11:17] <Vernaldo> I assume that since I have updated the firmware, maybe other livecds will load too, not just the ubuntu mac special cd
[11:17] <eeos> kling0n I do not understand why should that not be feasible.
[11:17] <kling0n> eeos: you could try downloading the livecd and making an ext2fs partition for it
[11:18] <eeos> kling0n and then?
[11:18] <kling0n> eeos: and then go look for a bootloader that supports both
[11:18] <kling0n> eeos: if you partition magic or similar you could do the partitioning easily
[11:19] <kling0n> eeos: what is the machine running atm?
[11:19] <eeos> kling0n I could eventually dowload the ISO, unpack it locally, reboot pointing to the istaller on hard disk.
[11:19] <Kachingo> leagris: Did you get that?
[11:19] <eeos> kling0n do not understand the question
[11:19] <kling0n> eeos: yes... but you will need to  make an ext2fs partition for the unpacked image
[11:20] <kling0n> eeos: is the machine currently running windows, linux or mac?
[11:20] <eeos> kling0n ubuntu 606 amd64, but need to move to 610 386.
[11:21] <kling0n> eeos: why not simply doing an upgrade?
[11:21] <eeos> kling0n because I eed to change architecture to 386
[11:21] <eeos> kling0n because this is the demo machine we use at the customers, and some stuff does not work on amd64 version
[11:21] <kling0n> eeos: you could install the 386 kernel and then simply choose that from grub :)
[11:22] <eeos> kling0n for example alsa based modems :(:(:(:(
[11:22] <kling0n> eeos: :(
[11:22] <eeos> kling0n explain, please.
[11:22] <kling0n> eeos: sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.17-10-386 (or whatever release is avaliable for dapper)
[11:23] <kling0n> eeos: then choose that kernel from the bootloader in stead of the 64bit one
[11:23] <eeos> kling0n yes, but all the remainig ackages I have at the moment are amd64!
[11:23] <mneptok> kling0n: that will not work, as the modules are compiled for AMD64
[11:23] <eeos> kling0n so I imagine they have been compiled for it.
[11:23] <eeos> kling0n including all the modules.
[11:23] <eeos> thanks mneptok
[11:23] <kling0n> eeos: cross- compile a base system?
[11:23] <mneptok> eeos: just get a 6.10 alternate CD and use it to upgrade
[11:24] <kling0n> mneptok: he can't use cds apparently
[11:24] <eeos> mneptok that is the point, cannot use the cd
[11:24] <cr4ftyb0n35> Hello all. Have a small problem, where I installed a touchscreen, and the install process of the driver inserted a bootscript at run level 2(default). Now for some vague reason, on boot, all my devices are screwed up. /dev is completely hosed
[11:24] <mneptok> eeos: why is that?
[11:24] <kling0n> eeos: if you're in a hw shop cant you borrow a drive?
[11:24] <ddj> "hosed" ??? How?
[11:24] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: Unsure.  But I am not able to find anything in the logs.
[11:25] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: basically none of the devices exist
[11:25] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: its as if mknod never ran. Even dev null is bad
[11:25] <bigbro> eeos: You can set up a PXE boot server and boot from that and TFTP - but you should probably be aware that setting up such things requires more hardware and can be more difficult to debug.
[11:25] <pinchartl> hi
[11:25] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: so as soon as I log into X, I get a console with the whole /dev/null permission denied
[11:25] <eeos> bigbro yes, I know
[11:25] <ddj> CR4 ... and if you reboot?
[11:25] <kling0n> bigbro: we've already been around that solution
[11:25] <eeos> ok, I will try to use a different approach!
[11:26] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: same deal
[11:26] <mneptok> eeos: what's wrong with a CD install?
[11:26] <eeos> thanks to everybody!
[11:26] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: if I boot into runlevel 1, its fine
[11:26] <ddj> all the files in /dev are virtual anyway
[11:26] <kling0n> mneptok: he has no drive
[11:26] <bigbro> eeos: THere are few other solutions. Ubuntu is designed to boot off a CD. If you can't use a CD, then you are probably looking at the wrong solution to your problem.
[11:26] <eeos> mneptok that I can't do it now.
[11:26] <kling0n> eeos: you're welcome
[11:26] <Kachingo> leagris: Hmmm, it seems I can't reply to your private messages or anything, you don't reply to pings. Can you private message me a different way of contacting you?
[11:26] <mneptok> eeos: there's no spare drive you could plug in?
[11:26] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: the mknod seems to run fine if that script doesn't execute. So obviously the script is the issue. But the script is so ridiculously tiny, I don't know what's screwing it up
[11:26] <kling0n> mneptok: ooh yeah good idea!
[11:26] <eeos> mneptok no, or I would have done before :P
[11:27] <kling0n> eeos: an extra drive and debootstrap could do it
[11:27] <ddj> CR4 .... can you paste it here?
[11:27] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: paste what?
[11:27] <kling0n> eeos: or make a new partition on your drive and use debotstrap
[11:27] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: hang on
[11:27] <mneptok> eeos: then netbooting is your option
[11:27] <kling0n> debootstrap
[11:27] <eeos> kling0n I have a chroot environment! what about installing from the chroot enviroment????

[11:28] <pinchartl> I somehow managed to break sshd, so I'll have to fix that first. it now refuses to listen on both :: (ipv6) and 0.0.0.0 (ipv4) together. I can get it to listen on one of those, but not on both. could anyone help me (ubuntu 6.10 server) ?
[11:28] <eeos> kling0n that sounds a very interesting solution! can you point me to documetation?
[11:28] <kling0n> eeos: that would only install it in the chroot env
[11:28] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: the problem is that /dev doesn;t have the execution bit set
[11:28] <eeos> kling0n I meant make a new partition on your drive and use debotstrap
[11:28] <kling0n> eeos: but if you can free some space and make a new primary partition , you could use debootstrap to make an install on there
[11:28] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: granted, but why is this script ruining it? If I don't insert the script on  bootup, everything works fine
[11:28] <ddj> yeah, those permissions look odd
[11:28] <kling0n> eeos: that would work
[11:28] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: yes, but they are getting screwed up, I wonder why. they are getting screwed up on runtime.
[11:28] <eeos> kling0n could ou point me to some documentatio, please?

[11:31] <eeos> kling0n hey! that is th documet I used to set up the chroot on my computer!
[11:31] <mneptok> kling0n: you're the man? cool. want to help debug some initramfs issues? :P
[11:31] <kling0n> mneptok: :P
[11:32] <Teejay__> Has anybody managed to run Ubuntu 6.10 on say a Pentium III 500mhz system with 128mb of ram?
[11:32] <kling0n> mneptok: i'd rather not :)
[11:32] <cr4ftyb0n35> Teejay: welcome to my world :D
[11:32] <kling0n> eeos: look for the debootstrap part
[11:32] <cr4ftyb0n35> Teejay: 6.06 works, 6.10 had major issues, not sure why. I gave up on it. I wasn't that keen
[11:32] <mneptok> Teejay__: you'd want Xubuntu
[11:32] <kling0n> eeos: then make a new partition, mount it and debootstrap into it with the --386 option
[11:32] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: what's that other script do?
[11:33] <frogzoo> cr4ftyb0n35: 128mb is pretty slim
[11:33] <cr4ftyb0n35> frog: yeah
[11:33] <eeos> yes then reboot from there and reinstal from there
[11:33] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: what other script?
[11:33] <kling0n> Teejay__: or fluxbox and env :)
[11:33] <kling0n> and=as
[11:33] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: the other scrupt called from the first one

[11:33] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: loadelo ?
[11:34] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: and what is this script for again?
[11:34] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: its loading a touchscreen driver
[11:34] <mneptok> it loads the Electric Light Orchestra?
[11:34] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: lol
[11:34] <cr4ftyb0n35> menptok: ELO manufactures touch screens
[11:34] <cr4ftyb0n35> Hang on let me pastebin the other script
[11:34] <mneptok> the driver has no kernel module?
[11:35] <ddj> CR4 .... what's that /elo/loadelo thing?
[11:35] <cr4ftyb0n35> menptok: nope sir. Though there was this thing on their site where you could compile it into the kernel, but the damned thing didn't work at all
[11:36] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36975/
[11:36] <mneptok> that's increditarded
[11:36] <cr4ftyb0n35> menptok :D
[11:36] <mneptok> oh, i see
[11:36] <Vernaldo> bye
[11:36] <Zaggynl> I just had a scaring experience, my keyboard stopped working altogether, mouse did work, most menu's in my gnome desktop didn't work either
[11:37] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: I can see that the stupid "test" line in the loadelo script is causing a possible problem
[11:37] <Zaggynl> reboot fixed it though :/
[11:37] <cr4ftyb0n35> But, I am unsure where
[11:37] <cr4ftyb0n35> GRRRRR
[11:37] <mneptok> add a hasbang to /bin/bash at the top of each elo script
[11:37] <Vernaldo> Zaggynl: ubuntu does that
[11:37] <mneptok> *hashbang
[11:37] <Zaggynl> Vernaldo, it does?!
[11:37] <Vernaldo> Zaggynl: it's to tell you that you shouldn't rely only on computers
[11:37] <Zaggynl> D:
[11:37] <cr4ftyb0n35> menptok: hmmm?
[11:37] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: ELO is making some dumb assumptions about your shell. specify BASH.
[11:37] <Zaggynl> There has at to be a logical explanation for that
[11:37] <Vernaldo> Zaggynl: it's to tell you that you should also get out more, rely on *humans*
[11:37] <dav_id> it might be a hardware error
[11:37] <Vernaldo> that humanity thing, i tell you
[11:38] <Vernaldo> dav_id: no, it's ubuntu
[11:38] <cr4ftyb0n35> menptok: interesting, let me try
[11:38] <dav_id> heh
[11:38] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: thanks, let me try and give it a reboot
[11:38] <Zaggynl> my windows sometimes frooze/rebooted out of itself too, first time in ubuntu T_T
[11:38] <Zaggynl> computers just follow programming, so either the hardware is damaged, or I did something stupid
[11:38] <mneptok> Zaggynl: or the progrmammers did.
[11:38] <dav_id> or both
[11:38] <Vernaldo> Zaggynl: OR the program is buggy
[11:39] <Zaggynl> I was just browsing for crying out loud
[11:39] <Zaggynl> Any logs I should check?
[11:39] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: you think that's it...?
[11:39] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: i think it's more than likely
[11:39] <Vernaldo> BYE all
[11:40] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: we just have to wait. Thanks for everything though. real help
[11:40] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: Please insert $0.25 to continue.
[11:40] <dav_id> has anyone read the official Debian book here? is it helpful when working with Ubuntu?
[11:41] <dav_id> I flicked through 'Ubuntu hacks' but thought that it was a bit.. basic for my liking
[11:42] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: I am afraid the quarter'll have to wait. it didn't work. Same issue.
[11:42] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: bah. le suq.
[11:43] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: oui monsieur, c'est la vie.
[11:43] <mneptok> oui, c'est vrai.
[11:43] <mneptok> tabernoche ...
[11:43] <ddj> @CR4 .... that script ... c'est incredible
[11:43] <ddj> incroyable
[11:43] <ddj> pardon :)
[11:43] <cr4ftyb0n35> menptok: something is weird...the mode in the script says 664. which is right...but something in that script is just really crazy
[11:44] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: Unable to know what the hell is going wrong there, I SWEAR its that stupid script, its just blowing something out. the mknods and the mkfifos...its annoying.
[11:44] <eeos> kling0n got a live cd!
[11:45] <mneptok> cr4ftyb0n35: svp, pastebin the changed script?
[11:45] <eeos> kling0n and working cd reaer!
[11:45] <eeos> kling0n but the screen goes totally blank, even when I try vga=771
[11:45] <eeos> kling0n after boot :(
[11:47] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: hang on, trying something. the \\$1 doesn't make sense to me
[11:47] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: so I am getting rid of the \\
[11:47] <math> hello guys
[11:47] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: think that might be it, hopefully...because that line just don't work in Bash...
[11:47] <math> my fglrx drivers doesnt work on my laptop
[11:48] <math> it says: cant open display
[11:48] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: in which case the if condition would fail and it could just act weird
[11:48] <kurisutofuaa> How do I force mount my CD-Rom/DvD-Rom drive?
[11:49] <osfameron> noncon with media devices is a bit rude
[11:49] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[11:49] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: lol, now the dev problem is gone, but the touchscreen no longer works :D
[11:50] <Starcraftmazter> any1 here?
[11:50] <Zaggynl> how do I check which version of ubuntu i run again
[11:50] <math> Zaggynl, overloper :P
[11:50] <ddj> @CR4 ... Can you try to change the script? Remove the lines where they delete stuff in /dev/* ....
[11:50] <Zaggynl> math, :P
[11:50] <math> uname -r ofzo?
[11:51] <Zaggynl> that's the kernel version
[11:51] <math> ooh
[11:51] <cr4ftyb0n35> ddj: sure, but that's unlikely to help. Clearly the issue is elsewhere...but sure, let's give it one more shot.
[11:53] <ndlovu> is there some way I can automatically set my routing so that I don't have to disconnect my wireless network (ifconfig eth1 down) in order to use my mobile phone as a modem?
[11:53] <math> how to install firefox 2.0 ?
[11:53] <math> apt-get install mozilla-firefox..?
[11:53] <math> will it replace my older one?
[11:53] <JoshHendo> math, what version of Ubuntu are you using?

[11:55] <math> ok thnx
[11:56] <math> JoshHendo, its not in synaptic?
[11:56] <JoshHendo> it is in Synaptic for Edgy, as it comes with edgy
[11:56] <math> ah :)
[11:57] <DarkLegacy> :O
[11:57] <Zaggynl> Where does firestart keeps its logfile? can't find it in /var/log
[11:57] <math> how about autofill?
[11:57] <cr4ftyb0n35> mneptok: that didn't work either
[11:57] <JoshHendo> math, is that about firefox?
[11:57] <JoshHendo> it should work the same as in 1.5
[11:57] <math> no something else in terminal
[11:57] <math> when u want to autofill a second word
[11:58] <stefg> Hi, has anyone ever tried to move a vmware-installation of ubuntu to a non-virtual machine? Would it work? My idea is to set up a 'golden machine' in vmware, and then just shift the whole installation to a real machine, as often as i want (because i tend to break edgy very often, when i'm trying things ;-) )
[11:58] <DarkLegacy> Download :: 12880 Kbps or 12.88 Mbps (1572 kB/s)
[11:58] <math> its not on dapper
[11:59] <JoshHendo> You may be thinking of 'fish'
[11:59] <math> sudo apt-get install [TAB]  gives more options in Edgy, but not in Dapper

[12:00] <cr4ftyb0n35> I FOUND IT! The problem was \\. It should only be one slash, typo in the original sript
[12:01] <we2by> my wireless dies from time to time and I have to reload the module to get it back working
[12:01] <nata1> whats the best webdesign program for KDE?
[12:01] <nata1> like dreamweaver.
[12:01] <we2by> kedit
[12:01] <JoshHendo> What drivers are you you using for your wireless card we2by?
[12:01] <we2by> JoshHendo, it is rt2500
[12:02] <JoshHendo> we2by, try bluefish or nvu, doesn't really matter if you use GTK in KDE imho
[12:02] <Zaggynl> Anyone knows where firestarter keeps its logfiles? I can't find it in any documentation
[12:02] <we2by> JoshHendo, nah, I prefer gedit
[12:02] <math> dont use nvu if u want to do some php-programming
[12:02] <bvanaerde> I'm also using gedit for the moment
[12:03] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: somewhere in /var/log I'd guess
[12:03] <we2by> yea, nvu sucks on php.
[12:03] <Starcraftmazter> any1 here run dreamweaver on ubuntu?
[12:03] <we2by> a php editor with auto completion would be nice
[12:03] <bvanaerde> the only thing that comes close to dreamweaver, is Eclipse
[12:03] <JoshHendo> I answered that as the question was a webdesign program like dreamweaver
[12:03] <math> bluefish is realy cool
[12:03] <math> I like it a lot
[12:03] <JoshHendo> Starcraftmazter, there are tutorials that will allow you to run dreamweaver in wine
[12:03] <we2by> math, does it have autocompletion?
[12:03] <Starcraftmazter> can you recomend any?
[12:03] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, I tried looking there, can't find firestarter or iptables
[12:03] <math> JoshHendo, what's the big difference between firefox 1.5 and 2.0?
[12:03] <Starcraftmazter> recommend*
[12:04] <math> we2by I've to find out
[12:04] <JoshHendo> math: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/
[12:04] <math> not installed it on this laptop
[12:04] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: oh, as I recall, you need to enable logging in firestarter
[12:04] <math> JoshHendo, :D thnx
[12:04] <Zaggynl> frogzoo, okay I'll go looking in the gui
[12:04] <frogzoo> Zaggynl: yep
[12:05] <Zaggynl> can't find it D:
[12:05] <Starcraftmazter> what are the best compilers for tarballs?
[12:05] <JoshHendo> whoever it was who was having problems with their wireless card, check here: http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php/HOWTOS
[12:05] <bvanaerde> dreamweaver in wine: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=200305
[12:05] <JoshHendo> starcraftmazter: do you mean to create a tar file?
[12:06] <Starcraftmazter> nay
[12:06] <JoshHendo> Just use archive manager
[12:06] <Starcraftmazter> I'll be installing a lot of tarballs, for lamp, etc
[12:06] <we2by> JoshHendo, thanks
[12:06] <Starcraftmazter> so I'll need to compile a lot of things from source
[12:06] <Starcraftmazter> i understand ubuntu doesn't come with any compilers?
[12:06] <JoshHendo> you will need to unzip them, and then compile them using the make command
[12:06] <Starcraftmazter> yeh, I know how it's done
[12:07] <we2by> JoshHendo, maybe I foud out what was causing this problem. too many open connections
[12:07] <Starcraftmazter> BUT, does ubuntu have the necessary compilers, out of the box
[12:07] <we2by> I have over 300 connections open for BT
[12:07] <JoshHendo> hehe
[12:07] <JoshHendo> ok
[12:07] <we2by> just lowered it to 200 and works nice
[12:07] <we2by> hope it stays so :)

[12:16] <M3G4crux> I got it to work when I halt or reboot. but not on boot

[12:17] <M3G4crux> ok I knew that I just wanted to call your attention heheh
[12:18] <M3G4crux> however that is not splashy, that is usplash
[12:18] <Pippo> who can help me?
[12:19] <nothlit> frogzoo, you can edit the properties of the virtual machine and change the networking properties to nat
[12:19] <M3G4crux> ok, lets try something different. Has anyone been able to install a java program from windows on a ubuntu box through wine?
[12:19] <we2by> math, gphpedit is a nice editor too. it gives a reference when you type mysql_query :)
[12:20] <math> cool thnx
[12:20] <math> :)
[12:22] <we2by> math, it got auto-complete too! nice
[12:22] <math> nice!
[12:23] <math> I'll install it now :D
[12:23] <we2by> but only for buildin php functions
[12:23] <math> not with html syntaxes?
[12:23] <nata1> whats the easiest way to install java?
[12:23] <we2by> don't think so
[12:23] <nata1> is there an apt package available for that?
[12:23] <we2by> it's still a nice editor
[12:23] <we2by> :)
[12:24] <nata1> eclipse needs java to run. :(

[12:24] <math> ye :)
[12:24] <ika> i m new comer
[12:24] <tonyyarusso> Welcome ika
[12:24] <ika> where is the update config file?
[12:25] <Wiseguy> hey guys, how do i get the mac osx looking app bar at the bottom of my screen... im looking at gnome-look.org and i see lots of themes that show that tool bar but i cant figure out how to get it up
[12:25] <apokryphos> ika: update config file?
[12:25] <tonyyarusso> ika: What do you mean?
[12:25] <apokryphos> ika: if you're looking to upgrade, you want to read the upgrade instructions.
[12:25] <apokryphos> ika: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[12:25] <ika> update resourse config file
[12:26] <roovis> Wiseguy: I think you're talking about kiba dock
[12:26] <tonyyarusso> Wiseguy: This might help - http://www.taimila.com/ubuntuosx.php

[12:27] <math> we2by,
[12:27] <math> how to auto complete?
[12:27] <apokryphos> math: auto-complete what?
[12:28] <math> in gphpedit
[12:28] <frogzoo> math: hit tab?
[12:28] <gnomefreak> math: the tab button might do it
[12:28] <math> oh just like in the terminal
[12:29] <math> doesnt work
[12:29] <frogzoo> !doesn't work
[12:29] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.

[12:35] <math> cu :)
[12:35] <Mongrol> can anyone tell me how to set the QT theme? I`m not using kubuntu, just have some QT apps
[12:35] <shiner421> So I was goofing around with the file that contains all my boot info, and I somehow removed the entry for my windows partition
[12:36] <shiner421> how do I get that back?
[12:36] <gnomefreak> shiner421: did you make a backup?
[12:36] <shiner421> Lesson learned here, dont mess with that stuff
[12:36] <shiner421> ahh, no
[12:36] <gnomefreak> shiner421: :(
[12:36] <shiner421> yea I know
[12:36] <gnomefreak> shiner421: file file?
[12:36] <shiner421> part of the learning process
[12:36] <gnomefreak> what file?
[12:36] <shiner421> let me look it up
[12:37] <Magilla> frogzoo: what does that show me?
[12:37] <shiner421> menu.lst
[12:37] <_raphael_> if I want to install debs for openoffice manually, do I have to remove the old openoffice packages?
[12:37] <frogzoo> Magilla: what did it say?
[12:37] <pvf> oi oi...does anyone know how to switch focus to a window on gnome without obscuring the first one...with the keyboard
[12:37] <gnomefreak> shiner421: there might be a backup made for you look in /boot/grub/ for a menu.lst~ or something like that
[12:38] <Magilla> drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 2006-12-14 20:05 /var/www/
[12:38] <shiner421> yea there is one like that
[12:38] <shiner421> so I jsut copy it over to the other one?
[12:39] <gnomefreak> shiner421: open it see if the windows part is there  and replace the /boot/grub/menu.lst with that one
[12:39] <gnomefreak> shiner421: or copy it over :)
[12:39] <shiner421> well, that was easy
[12:39] <shiner421> ok next question
=== refus3d is now known as uberubuntu
[12:39] <shiner421> I have a few entries in my list that I dont want
[12:39] <gnomefreak> shiner421: always back up files before playing with them please
[12:39] <shiner421> such as a kernel I installed that doesnt quite work
[12:39] <gnomefreak> shiner421: what list?
[12:39] <shiner421> the grub boot menu
=== uberubuntu is now known as refus3d
[12:40] <Magilla> I thought ubuntu runs apache as www-data though...
[12:40] <shiner421> it has the 386 kernel which I got my video drivers to work with
[12:40] <Wiseguy> is there a way to get the open apps to minimize to the top bar rather than the bottom one?
[12:40] <shiner421> the 686 kernel doesnt work
[12:40] <Magilla> does that mean apache is running as root?
[12:40] <shiner421> it completely crashes my system
[12:40] <gnomefreak> shiner421: open synaptic and search kernel than find ones you dont need or want and choose complete removal
[12:40] <shiner421> thought so
[12:40] <shiner421> hehe learning fast here
[12:40] <gnomefreak> shiner421: that will delete them from /boot/grub/menu.lst also :)

[12:41] <shiner421> oh yea I think I installed beryl, but I dont know how to get it to work
[12:41] <Lynoure> Wiseguy: how about manually switching the bars around? or moving the tasklist area from lower to upper one? I'm in kde, but I bet you can do either.
[12:41] <Magilla> shiner421: I'm running Beryl. It's sweet as :D
[12:41] <Infeliz> my xgl doesnt work, where are the logs?
[12:41] <shiner421> found it, eager to check this out
[12:41] <shiner421> brb as I p[lay with this a second
[12:42] <Wiseguy> Lynoure, because im still using the bottom bar as an app launcher
[12:42] <shiner421> ok I see the config program, but I dont see any 3d effects on my desktop of any kind
[12:42] <Lynoure> Wiseguy: in kde those are different. Not in gnome?

[01:07] <tim167> not sure, i just followed some update wizard
[01:07] <rajiv_nair> !sound | tim
[01:07] <ubotu> tim: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[01:07] <tim167> if I try to open Volume control, i get : "The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured"
=== uberubuntu is now known as refus3d
[01:07] <Magilla> jrib: I got sick of having to sudo to create/edit/move/delete files and folders in /var/www so I put a symlink in there pointing to ~/webpages
[01:08] <rajiv_nair> tim: check out the links ubotu gave u
[01:08] <Magilla> it works fine until I ask php to work out where a folder is
[01:08] <jrib> Magilla: best way is to create a group for web editing, add yourself to that group, and change /var/www to be owned by that group
[01:09] <VSpike> I was thinking, since moving from Windows, I've often been less than impressed by the quality of application software available in Ubuntu (bought to mind as yet another app failed the first time I tried to use it).  One thing I love about Linux is the command line - the Bash shell and all the good stuff that goes with it (awk, sed, grep, etc.).  However, I could have all that stuff on Windows with Cygwin...
[01:09] <Magilla> the then resolves the symlink and takes a dump because it can't write to ~
[01:09] <rajiv_nair> Vspike: wats ur point??
[01:09] <VSpike> My question is, what is your killer app on ubuntu/Linux?  Which app do you find really indispensible?
[01:09] <Magilla> jrib: as long as that doesn't kill apaches ability to work in /var/www
[01:10] <jrib> VSpike: vim, but this is a question for #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:10] <VSpike> my reason for asking is for my own education about what's available, so that I can check out some that I haven't heard off
[01:10] <jrib> Magilla: no, it should work fine
[01:10] <Magilla> 'k, thanks
[01:10] <VSpike> jrib: yeah, I did wonder. It's kind of a support question, and kind of not, but I'll take it over there
[01:10] <tim167> rajiv_nair: I had a perfectly working hammerfal hdsp+multiface before upgrading, now it doesnt even load

[01:17] <jacquesmerde> yo, on my previous distro i screwed around with mounting and symlinking a fat32 partition, and now all the permissions on different subdirectories are different. i assumed the permissions were on the previous linux partition, but now that partition is gone. how do i reset to normal permissions on the fat32 partition?
[01:17] <Infeliz> how do i solve problem, xgl doesnt work
[01:17] <kavit> pitti: launchpad.net says the bug has been resolved but /dev doesn't get device nodes

[01:18] <patbam> hi, does anyone happen to know where python2.5 's libs are supposed to live in dapper? they seem to be in /usr/local/lib/python.2.5 but 2.4 was in /usr/lib/python2.4 (no /local/ )
[01:18] <cdavis_> is vmware server working with edgy?  I had it working with dapper but when I upgraded vmware stopped working
[01:19] <kavit> pitti: is this worth bothering you or is it a different issue and needs to be reported accordingly?
[01:19] <jrib> patbam: /usr/local is stuff you installed without using the package manager
[01:19] <iltomee> hi
[01:20] <kurisutofuaa> How do I convert a .cdr image to .iso image?
[01:20] <patbam> jrib: ah, oh yeah. i guess i installed 2.5 from a tarball, forgot. if 2.5 is in the repos now, would installing it from synaptic be extraordinarily bad, ray?
[01:20] <cdavis_> If I install vmware through synaptic can I keep my vmware machines and not have to reinstall windows as a vmware guest?
[01:20] <jrib> patbam: no, but your system will still prefer the one in /usr/local since /usr/local comes first in your PATH
[01:21] <daviey> cdavis_, you should be able to, it's just a case of loading the vmx file
[01:21] <frogzoo> cdavis_: of course

[01:21] <frogzoo> !helpme
[01:21] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:21] <cdavis_> daviey, the vmx file is all I need?
[01:22] <jrib> patbam: I would remove the /usr/local installation and use the repositories myself.  np
[01:22] <frogzoo> cdavis_: no, you need the disk image as well
[01:22] <daviey> well those around it aswell, but the vmx is the machine image
[01:22] <iltomee> i tryed w/ apt-get and also w/ the package manager
[01:22] <patbam> jrib: i'm looking to see if 2.5 has made it into the repo yet
[01:22] <jrib> iltomee: pastebin the output of 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
[01:22] <daviey> iltomee, what error is getting returned?
[01:22] <iltomee> i messed around w/ my sourcle.list before, so...
[01:22] <jrib> patbam: I know it is in edgy, don't know about dapper
[01:22] <patbam> jrib: doesn't seem to be there, guess not yet.
[01:22] <frogzoo> anyone know how to get vmware's networking to use tap0 ?
[01:22] <MaDrense> hi ppl ...
[01:22] <patbam> jrib: the name "edgy" makes me nervous :D
[01:22] <daviey> frogzoo, part of installation
[01:22] <jrib> patbam: heh
[01:23] <frogzoo> patbam: it's better than dapper, imo
[01:23] <iltomee> jrib, just a sec
[01:23] <fenrig> how do  I mount a hard disk when running the ubuntu live cd?
[01:23] <MaDrense> got a question that I know has been asked a lot ... but i really havent found a clear answer
[01:23] <fenrig> !mount
[01:23] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted (also "man mkfs" for formatting) - Mounting partitions in Gnome under Dapper: System -> Administration -> Disks - For Edgy, see !fstab and !DiskMounter
[01:23] <patbam> is upgrading difficult?
[01:23] <frogzoo> daviey: you have this working?
[01:23] <MaDrense> got an intel core 2 duo ..
[01:23] <jrib> iltomee: pastebinning /etc/apt/sources.list too would probably help
[01:23] <MaDrense> should i go 32 bits or 64 bits ?
[01:23] <jrib> !upgrade | patbam
[01:23] <ubotu> patbam: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:23] <frogzoo> daviey: you're using tap0, and NOT bridging?
[01:23] <patbam> thanks
[01:23] <MaDrense> anyone ?
[01:23] <daviey> fenrig, in console mount /dev/hd1a /mnt/folder  (hda1 = the hd and folder needs to exsist) so mkdir /mnt/folder (example
[01:24] <iltomee> jrib, here u go:

[01:24] <daviey> frogzoo, naa, didn't get it working :(
[01:24] <fenrig> thx il try
[01:24] <jacquesmerde> yo, on my previous distro i screwed around with mounting and symlinking a fat32 partition, and now all the permissions on different subdirectories are different. i assumed the permissions were on the previous linux partition, but now that partition is gone. how do i reset to normal permissions on the fat32 partition?
[01:24] <frogzoo> daviey: tap0 worked on dapper, but the install scripts don't seem to set it up on edgy
[01:24] <cdavis_> synaptic tells me it can't that an update for mplayer is available, but it wont let me select it?
[01:24] <daviey> frogzoo, no idea then, sorry
[01:25] <fenrig> hello
[01:25] <jrib> iltomee: use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org for your /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:25] <iltomee> jrib: what is pastebin?
[01:25] <fenrig> uhm what is the
[01:25] <fenrig> root password for the live cd?
[01:25] <bigbro> jacquesmerde: FAT32 doesn't have permissions - the filesystem doesn't support them. What are you trying to do exactly?
[01:25] <frogzoo> daviey: well it hasn't beaten me yet
[01:25] <MaDrense> has anyone been using a 64 bit version with the intel core 2 duo ?
[01:25] <apokryphos> fenrig: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[01:25] <iltomee> jrib ok
[01:26] <daviey> fenrig, use 'sudo su' to get root access
[01:26] <apokryphos> daviey: please do not advise that
[01:26] <apokryphos> daviey: recommend sudo -i instead
[01:26] <daviey> apokryphos, whats the diffeence
[01:26] <apokryphos> (if you want someone to get a jailed root session)
[01:26] <iltomee> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36986/
[01:26] <apokryphos> daviey: one uses su to get root access, the other plainly uses sudo. Furthermore, sudo -i sets up the envrionment more appropriately (see man sudo)
[01:27] <jrib> iltomee: what version of ubuntu are you using?
[01:27] <lambert> hi max
[01:27] <iltomee> dapper
[01:27] <daviey> apokryphos, for a live cd - surely they are interchangable
[01:27] <patbam> gksu has to be run with sudo, right?
[01:27] <jacquesmerde> bigbro: this is what i thought! hence my confusion! please help
[01:28] <iltomee> jrib 6.06
[01:28] <daviey> patbam, use gksudo
[01:28] <buzzy-> hello,  i have a problem on my hard disk> i have resized some partitions and now windows does not start anymore...if i start linux (ubuntu) it makes the filesystem check...but fails and asks me to do it manually O_O..what can i do_
[01:28] <buzzy-> ?
[01:28] <jrib> iltomee: apt-cache policy build-essential libc6-dev libc-dev g++        on pastebin please
=== sateh_ is now known as sateh
[01:28] <apokryphos> daviey: no, not the same environment variables are set. And like I said, even if it's interchangable: one uses su to get root access, the other uses sudo. sudo is the recommended model on Ubuntu. It provides problems if we tell users to use sudo, not su, and then we have that recommended for a jailed session
[01:28] <patbam> daviey: [[[ $ gksudo "update-manager -c "  ] ] ]  ?
[01:29] <apokryphos> daviey: sudo handles jailed root sessions just fine, and that's with sudo -i.
[01:29] <MartySk_tch> buzzy - how did you resize the partition?
[01:29] <buzzy-> gparted
[01:29] <jrib> patbam: no, you can just use gksu, no sudo
[01:29] <buzzy-> MartySk_tch, but i did not touch windows one
[01:29] <apokryphos> patbam: right
[01:29] <buzzy-> i resized data poartitions
[01:29] <daviey> patbam, shoudl work.  you want to update TO edgy?
[01:29] <patbam> jrib: head a splodes somewhat.
[01:30] <jacquesmerde> bigbro: i JUST installed ubuntu. /media/shared is where i mounted my fat32 partition. all its subdirectories have standard permissions: drwxrwx--- , but the one i fiddled with on my old distro has permissions dr-xr-x---. how did THAT come about?
[01:30] <patbam> er, that was supposed to be for everyone heh
[01:30] <patbam> daviey: well, i'm thinking about it :)
[01:30] <apokryphos> patbam: all of this is covered in the FAQ.
[01:30] <iltomee> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36987/
[01:30] <nata1> is there a apt package available for Mozilla Thunderbird?
[01:30] <MartySk_tch> buzzy How hard would it be to reset the partion back to the original size
[01:30] <apokryphos> nata1: yes
[01:30] <daviey> nata1, yes
[01:30] <nata1> whats it called?
[01:30] <bigbro> jacquesmerde: It will inherit the permissions you mount it with.
[01:30] <apokryphos> !package | nata1
[01:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about package - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:30] <apokryphos> !packages | nata1
[01:30] <nata1> cuz apt-get install thunderbird didnt work
[01:30] <ubotu> nata1: You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[01:30] <buzzy-> MartySk_tch, ..?
[01:30] <apokryphos> nata1: use Synaptic.
[01:31] <nata1> apokryphos: whats that?
[01:31] <nata1> and where?
[01:31] <apokryphos> !synaptic
[01:31] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[01:31] <iltomee> jrib, this does not look good, does it?
[01:31] <daviey> MartySk_tch, thats probably not the problem.  I expect you have lost the MBR.  google should help.  failing that.  Installing ubuntu back ontop of the old ubuntu partition
[01:31] <apokryphos> nata1: in the menus
[01:31] <gbrent> I am tryying to add wwww-data in the sudoers file but do not want to mess it up and the man file is confusing. I jyst want www-data to be able to run the shudown command
[01:31] <gbrent> anyone help?
[01:32] <javaJake> At Automatix website - "If someone on #Ubuntu told you that Automatix caused a certain problem don't believe him/her. Its a known fact that the #Ubuntu channel spreads misinformation about Automatix."
[01:32] <biotrox> hi
[01:32] <apokryphos> javaJake: whatever
[01:32] <jrib> iltomee: have you used any other repositories or installed from deb packages ever?
[01:32] <biotrox> how am i able to make my webcam works..?
[01:32] <MartySk_tch> daviey is there an format option to restore the mbr?
[01:32] <javaJake> I think the bot's !automatix entry needs to be removed, then, if it's false.
[01:32] <apokryphos> javaJake: considering it isn't........
[01:32] <javaJake> apokryphos, Yea, how?
[01:32] <shiner421> oh good god HELP!!
[01:32] <jacquesmerde> bigbro: i'm just mounting the partition wholesale. WHERE is the information coming from to give different SUBdirectories in that partition different permissions?
[01:32] <jrib> automatix talk somewhere else please
[01:33] <apokryphos> javaJake: we've seen countless of broken systems from bad apt sources added, from bad package versions installed, etc
[01:33] <shiner421> ive pretty much trashed my system just now to the point of complete reinstall
[01:33] <iltomee> jrib: yeah, probably i did, i installed ubuntu 4 the 1. time a couple of month ago, and i was just messing around :(
[01:33] <shiner421> and im getting REAL sick of having to do this over and over
[01:33] <iltomee> jrib: i know i modified my source.list file a number of times
[01:33] <fenrig> I cant get it mount
[01:33] <apokryphos> javaJake: also the author of automatix has been VERY disenclined to take any pieces of advice from many of us and other ubuntu members.
[01:33] <tim167> after installing an upgrade ALL sounddevices dissapeared! is there a way to see what I upgraded last and/or downgrade ?
[01:33] <fenrig> i want to mount /dev/sda2
[01:33] <jrib> iltomee: ok, lets see if we can get to the root of the problem, join me in #ubuntu-classroom and we'll try a few commands
[01:33] <javaJake> apokryphos, ok
[01:33] <javaJake> Just checking to be sure. :P
[01:33] <shiner421> I have lost almost al lof my kernels
[01:33] <javaJake> shiner421, welcome to linux. ;)
[01:34] <daviey> MartySk_tch, don't know - but there are tools.  i aint used them though
[01:34] <javaJake> shiner421, no, linux isn't supposed to be like that, actually
[01:34] <shiner421> and it took me aq bunch of goofing around to even get x server to start
[01:34] <javaJake> shiner421, how did your computer get to this state?
[01:34] <fenrig> i cant get /dev/sda2 mounted
[01:34] <fenrig> and i need to
[01:34] <tim167> yesterday update notifier suggested to run an update, after that ALL sounddevices dissapeared, how can I fix this ?
[01:34] <fenrig> im in the live cd
[01:34] <shiner421> well, I want to use linux, but the fact is that it being this difficult to do the simplist things is why it will NEVER make it mainstream
[01:34] <shiner421> I was trying to get beryl to work
[01:34] <shiner421> I actually got it up to the splash screen
[01:35] <shiner421> then EVERYTHING froze
[01:35] <daviey> fenrig, are you sudo'ing it first ie sudo mount ....
[01:35] <fenrig> i've used su
[01:35] <shiner421> and now I cannot boot to the regular kernel
[01:35] <shiner421> the other 2 kernels I had installed disappeared
[01:35] <fenrig> and i have enabled the root
[01:35] <shiner421> and my nvidia driver no longer works
[01:35] <javaJake> shiner421, ew... sounds like your hard drive did something.
[01:35] <fallingdutch> is anyone here using svn on Ubunut6.10 amd64?
[01:35] <jacquesmerde> there must be some read-only bit for directories in fat32 like there is for files, yeah? anyone know how to change that?
[01:35] <shiner421> no, not the hard drive
[01:35] <shiner421> id bet an entire alienware computer on it
[01:36] <javaJake> shiner421, heheh
[01:36] <tim167> An update yesterday deleted all sounddevice configurations, can I downgrade or see what's been updated ? I dont know exactly what was installed or upgraded
[01:36] <javaJake> shiner421, ok, btw, you were using fglrx drivers right?
=== VSpike is now known as VSpike-away
[01:36] <shiner421> huh?
[01:36] <shiner421> never heard of those
[01:36] <javaJake> shiner421, ok
[01:36] <fenrig> im in the terminal and im logged in as root
[01:36] <shiner421> u mean glx dreivers?
[01:36] <javaJake> shiner421, what does X use for 3D acell?
[01:36] <shiner421> nothing anymore :(
[01:36] <fenrig> but when i try to mount use
[01:36] <javaJake> shiner421, heh, no before
[01:36] <shiner421> ahh nvidia glx
[01:37] <javaJake> shiner421, ok... hmmm...
[01:37] <bimberi> tim167: /var/log/dpkg.log will have info on what was done
[01:37] <fenrig> it says permission denied
[01:37] <shiner421> and I never did quite figure out how I got it to work, and now I have to spend another 2 hours trying to redo it
[01:37] <shiner421> not to mention I am booted in safe mode at the moment
[01:37] <javaJake> shiner421, yea, I'd bet a million when you turned off your computer, the hard drive wrote over a bunch of stuff.
[01:37] <fenrig> nvidia xgl sucks
[01:37] <shiner421> nvidia glx is the only thing u can use when you have an nvidia card
[01:37] <fallingdutch> anyone here using svn and has installed ubuntu6.10?
[01:37] <ToHellWithGA> what command can i run to change the settings for xorg to allow new refresh rates and resolutions?
[01:37] <javaJake> shiner421, I mean, I installed Beryl (as has thousands others) and we've never hit that problem.
[01:38] <fenrig> now i need to reconfigure /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf-custom
[01:38] <shiner421> I still dont know how to properly install stuff
[01:38] <shiner421> and on top of that
[01:38] <fenrig> but i cant get on my hard drive to fix it
[01:38] <shiner421> bah to heck with it
[01:38] <jrib> !xconfig | ToHellWithGA
[01:38] <ubotu> ToHellWithGA: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[01:38] <javaJake> shiner421, However, you turned off your computer (probably not the correct way - power button)
[01:38] <shiner421> I had no choice
[01:38] <javaJake> shiner421, heh, sorry, I really truly think when you turned off your computer incorrectly the hard drive did something.
[01:38] <shiner421> the logout button wouldnt work
[01:38] <daviey> How can i make my desktop appear a 16:9 output?
[01:39] <shiner421> NOTHING was responding after rebooting after installing beryl
[01:39] <prOMiNd> weeee
[01:39] <ToHellWithGA> thanks jrib
[01:39] <prOMiNd> hi all :D
[01:39] <javaJake> shiner421, there are methods to shutting down (the Raising Skinny Elephants Is Boring method)
[01:39] <shiner421> no menus, buttons, links, programs, etc.
[01:39] <shiner421> right but after I installed beryl, nothing worked
[01:39] <shiner421> I had no choice
[01:39] <fenrig> can sombody help?
[01:39] <shiner421> and now I dont know how to get ubuntu to even boot properly
[01:40] <javaJake> shiner421, yea, there's really nothing any of us can do here except tell you to back up your stuff and reinstall
[01:40] <shiner421> the kernels I installed are actually still there, but they dont show up in the menu.lst file
[01:40] <fenrig> how do i mount a harddrive on
[01:40] <fenrig> a live cd
[01:40] <shiner421> ok then my question is this:
[01:40] <shiner421> I am using 6.10 edgy
[01:40] <javaJake> Ye
[01:40] <apokryphos> prOMiNd: please turn that off.
[01:40] <javaJake> Yea*
[01:40] <biotrox> fenrig | just mount as usual
[01:40] <fenrig> it says
[01:40] <fenrig> permission denied even in root
[01:41] <daviey> fenrig, i told you.  mount /dev/xxx /mnt/xxx
[01:41] <fenrig> okey
[01:41] <echosystm> hmm, guys, ubuntu sees my hard drives on my raid controllers, but not as an array
[01:41] <shiner421> and once I reinstall, I want to setup multimedia (be able to stream video from firefox), get my video card drivers properly installed, and get the proper kernel that I should be running installed
[01:41] <echosystm> if i set them up as single disk arrays, could i use software raid?
[01:41] <shiner421> never did get gstreamer to work
[01:41] <shiner421> it always says something about mms not working
[01:41] <Unity> hi i am new, how to solve after 'apt-get install linux-686' on Dapper and reboot mouse & keyboard don't work, same problem straight after install of Edgy Eft
[01:41] <fenrig> bash: /dev/sda2: Permission denied
[01:41] <echosystm> or would performance suck due to the controller not having drivers etc. ?
[01:41] <shiner421> the linux-686 package is faulty
[01:42] <shiner421> it dont work
[01:42] <javaJake> shiner421, you want the generic kernel
[01:42] <fenrig> it doesnt wants to mount
[01:42] <daviey> fenrig, /dev/sda2 does exist?
[01:42] <fenrig> yeah
[01:42] <shiner421> isnt the generic kernel the one that has the fewest features and doesnt support the features of my processor?
[01:42] <fenrig> gparted says so
[01:42] <shiner421> I have a P4
[01:42] <Unity> shiner421:  is this true?
[01:42] <biotrox> fenrig | r u sure ? that sda2 really exist
[01:42] <shiner421> well, it dont work for me
[01:42] <javaJake> shiner421, I have a P3, and I still use the generic kernel
[01:43] <fenrig> yeah
[01:43] <fenrig> wait
[01:43] <daviey> fenrig, and your certain that the device IS sda2 and your are doing it as root?
[01:43] <shiner421> I tried and when I booted into the 686 kernel it didnt even get far enough to start an x server
[01:43] <javaJake> shiner421, besides the improvements over each are minor. :P
[01:43] <Unity> k thx
[01:43] <javaJake> shiner421, oh, really?
[01:43] <shiner421> exactly my point jake
[01:43] <javaJake> shiner421, before beryl?
[01:43] <shiner421> I want to use all the features of my processor
[01:43] <shiner421> yea
[01:43] <shiner421> before beryl
[01:43] <javaJake> shiner421, ewww... ok....
[01:43] <javaJake> shiner421, holy smokes
[01:44] <daviey> fenrig, do fdisk -l to see what is attached
[01:44] <shiner421> oh good god get this
[01:44] <roovis> I like Beryl :)
[01:44] <shiner421> now my synaptic package manager is GONE
[01:44] <javaJake> shiner421, rofl
[01:44] <shiner421> GRR I want to check out beryl!
[01:44] <gbrent> ccan someone help me write my sudoers file with visudo?
[01:44] <shiner421> but ubuntu is so buggy ill never get there
[01:44] <kurisutofuaa> How do I convert a .cdr image to .iso image?
[01:44] <javaJake> shiner421, "sudo apt-get remove --purge beryl*"
[01:44] <shiner421> as much as I hate windows, there is a reason it is so popular
[01:44] <roovis> shiner421: anticompetitive business practices?
[01:44] <gbrent> What do I do to test the Sudoers file before saving it?
[01:44] <daviey> shiner421, because it is supplied with most new machines?
[01:44] <Volstrup> does anybody know of a good graphical 'frontend' for managing which services to start at which runlevels with Ubuntu/Gnome?
[01:45] <roovis> daviey: right on :)
[01:45] <javaJake> shiner421, Windows has its uses, for sure. Linux is not for everyone. Windows is for the average user, while Linux is for the rest of us. :)
[01:45] <javaJake> shiner421, NOT to say that average users can't make the jump, but unless they either really want to or need to, they'll never stick with Linux.
[01:45] <johns^> javaJake: not true. Linux is for the people who want to get a job done
[01:45] <javaJake> In my Experience
[01:45] <shiner421> there is no reason linux has to be so difficult to use
[01:45] <daviey> javaJake, Correct!  numnuts should use it as 'users' so they can't break it!
[01:45] <echosystm> anyone?
[01:46] <apokryphos> !offtopic
[01:46] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[01:46] <Unity> i want to get gfx card installed lol
[01:46] <echosystm> running drives ona raid controller without drivers?
[01:46] <javaJake> apokryphos, oh fine
[01:46] <johns^> :) ask yourself this: how much work would it take to install beryl like functionality on XP
[01:46] <javaJake> :P
[01:46] <shiner421> what is the PROPER way to install a new kernel?
[01:46] <l3mr> hi, i upgraded from dapper to eft and noticed that there are no more 686-smp kernel images, only -generic. how can i get an image the does support smp?
[01:46] <javaJake> shiner421, apt-get install, or Synaptic.
[01:46] <roovis> a support channel?
[01:46] <shiner421> ive done 3d desktops n windows and its a LOT easier than ubuntu
[01:46] <pao> HI I have installed ubuntu on a powerpc but I have no ideo wheter I have a CD player or a CDRW how can I easily know ?
[01:46] <Volstrup> l3mr: all kernels now support smp
[01:46] <javaJake> l3mr, the generic kernel works for everything now
[01:46] <gbrent> Looks like this became an argument channel over linux Windows
[01:47] <Ekinoks> for a "AMD X2", what Ubuntu i need ? "Ubuntu PC" or "Ubuntu 64-bit PC" ?
[01:47] <javaJake> lol..
[01:47] <gbrent> Please argue in #windows
[01:47] <johns^> shiner421: on Fedora Core 6 xgl/3d stuff is a click away
[01:47] <Unity> any alternative to 'apt-get install linux-686' ?
[01:47] <shiner421> how can I have lost synaptic from my system menu?
[01:47] <bimberi> !generic | l3mr
[01:47] <ubotu> l3mr: Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[01:47] <l3mr> Volstrup: hmm, trying to boot generic doesn't work, it stops when "trying to get acpiid" right at the beginning ..
[01:47] <johns^> I guess on Ubuntu 7.0x it wil be no differend
[01:47] <shiner421> thats one distro I havent tried yet, and I am thinking about going that way
[01:47] <gbrent> can someone help me write my sudoers file with visudo?
[01:48] <Volstrup> l3mr: what cpu do you have?
[01:48] <cpk1> installing from debian debs shouldnt cause any problems right?
[01:48] <l3mr> pentium D 3.2
[01:48] <apokryphos> cpk1: of course it can
[01:48] <gbrent> cpk1: no
[01:48] <javaJake> johns^, 3D stuff on 7.0x will be different, actually, if what I've heard is true.
[01:48] <bimberi> cpk1: it can. what's the package?
[01:48] <johns^> I've got Dapper, Edgy en Core 6 running at the moment. Ubuntu is easyer to setup
[01:48] <shiner421> im gonna try to reboot into the regular linux-generic kernel, but chances are it wont be able to start an x server
[01:48] <cpk1> libxine
[01:48] <l3mr> it cannot find the uuid that ubuntu wants, and falls  back into busybox
[01:48] <gbrent> I have not had any issues
[01:48] <cpk1> there isnt a dapper backport for it
[01:48] <johns^> javaJake: link?
[01:48] <javaJake> shiner421, hold on a sec...
[01:48] <javaJake> johns^, yea, two moments
[01:48] <screechingcat> how do i add a userscript to the greasemonkey in epiphany ?
[01:48] <apokryphos> cpk1: mp3 codecs for xine?
[01:49] <shiner421> I think that synaptic is gone cause I am in safe mode
[01:49] <cpk1> no, the xine library
[01:49] <cpk1> i want to to play flacs in amarok
[01:49] <cpk1> 1.1.1 doesnt work
[01:49] <biotrox> i already detect my genius webcam
[01:49] <cpk1> need 1.1.2 or greater
[01:49] <apokryphos> cpk1: edgy has 1.1.2
[01:49] <biotrox> but i don't know how to use this device :P pls help
[01:49] <cpk1> yes, but I am running dapper and stubborn =P
[01:50] <javaJake> johns^, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/composite-by-default https://blueprints.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/accelerated-x
[01:50] <apokryphos> cpk1: I'm not sure why it's not working, it really should.
[01:50] <javaJake> johns^, I can't find the other one... there was one other one...
[01:50] <johns^> javaJake: thanks!
[01:50] <apokryphos> cpk1: your safest bet is recompiling the ubuntu debian src from the edgy package
[01:50] <javaJake> shiner421, Check to see what processes are running.
[01:50] <javaJake> shiner421, any ssh processes? How about apt-gets?
[01:50] <shiner421> I do believe I jsut removed EVERY instance of my nvidia driver
[01:51] <tim167> please help! alsa is not working after i installed an update how can I fix this
[01:51] <shiner421> ahh
[01:51] <shiner421> forgot how to check processes
[01:51] <daviey> shiner421, top
[01:51] <shiner421> yea ghehe I no longer have any video drivers installed
[01:51] <cpk1> apokryphos: just using apt-build you mean? and hoping it doesnt end up wanting to rebuild tons of other stuff
[01:51] <l3mr> booting the 386 kernel works, booting generic throws me into busybox, saying ALERT: /dev/disk/by-UUID/somelongnumbers doesn't exist
[01:51] <javaJake> shiner421, Well, there's the GUI way (System -> Administration -> System Monitor) or terminal way (ps -A)
[01:51] <javaJake> shiner421, another terminal way, (top) but that won't give you everything
[01:51] <shiner421> got around 12-15 processes running
[01:51] <_raphael_> why do I have to remove ubuntu-desktop in order to remove openoffice? I want to install debs from openoffice.org
[01:52] <shiner421> oh
[01:52] <javaJake> shiner421, you on livecd?
[01:52] <apokryphos> cpk1: with apt-get -b, yes, and hoping -- yup.
[01:52] <shiner421> no
[01:52] <javaJake> shiner421, k
[01:52] <shiner421> I am in the generic kernel resuemode
[01:52] <shiner421> *rescue mode
[01:52] <apokryphos> _raphael_: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[01:52] <javaJake> shiner421, yep
[01:52] <shiner421> sh is running
[01:53] <shiner421> what I think I need to do now is reinstall my kernel and my nvidia drivers
[01:53] <javaJake> shiner421, kill it. (muhahahaha)
[01:53] <daviey> _raphael_, because ubuntu-desktop is a virtual package linking all required packages together.  If you remove one package the the virtual package isn't complete.  if it forces removal of ubuntu-desktop you will not loose gnome
[01:53] <shiner421> ok killed sh
[01:53] <javaJake> shiner421, I'm wondering if either an apt-get program is removing stuff, or someone got in and is making a mess, because to have programs disappearing like that is uncanny.
[01:54] <shiner421> I think its me
[01:54] <shiner421> I think its cause I am in rescue mode
[01:54] <shiner421> I am going to reboot
[01:54] <cpk1> apokryphos: so if in the event that fails is it relatively safe installing from a debian deb?
[01:54] <shiner421> if it dont work, I am going to bed and ill work on it after work tonight
[01:54] <edgy> Hi, how can I tell whether the OS installed is plain ubuntu or ubuntu server?
[01:54] <XCute4God> pls... anyone... ive tried to install BERYL and EMERALD themes in my Edgy 6.10, ATI X700 with 3D acceleration enabled, but the official guide didnt worked for me ;( ... anyone can help me?
[01:54] <_raphael_> daviey: so it is safe to remove, but I should reinstall it when I upgrade to feisty?
[01:54] <shiner421> for the love of god Xcute DONT! Lol
[01:54] <shiner421> J/K
[01:54] <apokryphos> cpk1: no, it's not ever really safe installing from a debian deb. Things are done differently there.
[01:55] <apokryphos> edgy: dpkg -l|grep desktop
[01:55] <apokryphos> !beryl | XCute4God
[01:55] <ubotu> XCute4God: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[01:55] <l3mr> what can i do to prevent grub in edgy to replace the root=/dev/sda1 with some weird UUID stuff when updating grub?
[01:55] <apokryphos> _raphael_: right
[01:55] <shiner421> thats what I dont get is when I install a kernel, it installs fine, but never updates the menu.lst file
[01:55] <shiner421> so you cant boot into it
[01:56] <javaJake> XCute4God, Compiz is supposedly smoother, faster, and more stable... look into that too.
[01:56] <edgy> apokryphos: but may be the person who installed it removed the -desktop package
[01:56] <apokryphos> edgy: well dpkg -l|grep gnome
[01:56] <apokryphos> or gtk
[01:56] <edgy> apokryphos: ok thanks
[01:57] <XCute4God> [javaJake] : hmmm
[01:57] <XCute4God> javaJake thanks
=== Wanderer_ is now known as Wanderer
[01:58] <shiner421> WOOT! I did it!
[01:58] <shiner421> and I have no idea how LOL
[01:58] <shiner421> ok so I now have a running system again
[01:58] <daviey> wooohoo
[01:58] <astroman> is anyone knows where i can find awk version of unix command ??? like fold, head, tail, diff thx
[01:58] <shiner421> synaptic is back
[01:58] <shiner421> so how do I install my nvidia drivers?
[01:58] <shiner421> ill do this one step at a time
[01:58] <javaJake> shiner421, try the forums
[01:59] <shiner421> the forums did nothing but to confuse me further
[01:59] <shiner421> there were like 8 ways to install the drivers
[01:59] <kaur> my laptop's idle cpu temp is about 50 C and I don't know what is causing it
[01:59] <kaur> please help
[01:59] <javaJake> Holy SMOKES! Feisty's an Upgrade Maniac! I installed 9 updates and 10 minutes later 9 more are available... :P
[01:59] <kaur> sometimes it is 43 C and doesn't go higher
[02:00] <protocol1> is there a way to find out which graphics driver im using from console?
[02:00] <jrib> astroman: what do you mean?
[02:00] <HymnToLife> protocol1,    cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep driver
[02:00] <javaJake> kaur, my temp is lucky to get to that point. :P
[02:00] <anwar> can anybody tell me the name of the package that is on the desktop CD that appears in system > administration as "Disks"?
[02:00] <HymnToLife> the last line it will return will most certainly be your graphics driver
[02:00] <anwar> need to install it via apt/synaptic
[02:01] <astroman> jrib : i need to find the bash command diff, fold, tail, head program with awk ???
[02:01] <javaJake> Here's the deal: I've got this here laptop running on a P3 processor. Now, this processor is supposed to be able to scale between two frequencies: 7xx MHz and 997MHz, but it is sticking at 997MHz in Feisty. How in the world to I get the thing unstuck? :)
[02:01] <kaur> javaJake: do u have any idea how to cool it?
[02:01] <johns^> HymnToLife: must by Driver
[02:01] <Rage__> javaJake: I used powernowd on my debian laptop...
[02:01] <johns^> grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf is shorter
[02:02] <FreeNet> hi may i know how to install a *.bin file for example this game "PlaneShift_CBV0.3.017.bin"
[02:02] <jrib> astroman: ok, I'm not familiar enough with awk to understand the question, maybe someone else can help
[02:02] <FreeNet> it says it's for ubuntu
[02:02] <HymnToLife> grep is case insensitive I think
[02:02] <HymnToLife> but I might be wrong
[02:02] <astroman> thx anyway
[02:02] <johns^> FreeNet: sh *.sh
[02:02] <javaJake> kaur, mmm, no, the laptop should automatically decide when it is too hot and turn on a fan or something
[02:02] <javaJake> Rage__, powernowd... ok...
[02:02] <anwar> can anyone answer my question?
[02:02] <kaur> javaJake: it turns on the fan when it reaches 50, but it should not reach that high at all when idle
[02:02] <javaJake> johns^, lol
[02:02] <daviey> FreeNet, easyiest way is to burn it to cd
[02:03] <daviey> (i epect
[02:03] <daviey> FreeNet, BIN is normally a CD image
[02:03] <shiner421> ok, got my drivers installed
[02:03] <FreeNet> any way else without having to install to CD?
[02:03] <javaJake> kaur, ok, don't know what to say...
[02:03] <shiner421> now where did you say to go to PROPERLY install beryl?
[02:03] <javaJake> shiner421, wiki.beryl-project.com
[02:03] <javaJake> shiner421, and follow the AiGLX instructions.
[02:03] <shiner421> k thanks :)
[02:03] <kaur> javaJake: I've looked around in the forum and it seems that this is a common bug
[02:04] <javaJake> kaur, oh, ok...
[02:04] <javaJake> kaur, perhaps the problem is the same as mine - processor running at full speed even when idle. :P
[02:04] <anwar> hello??
[02:04] <shiner421> hmm wiki.beryl-project.com is no good
[02:04] <apokryphos> !beryl
[02:04] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[02:04] <kaur> javaJake: i had that problem and i solved it
[02:05] <javaJake> shiner421, WHAT!?
[02:05] <javaJake> kaur, oh, how?
[02:05] <FreeNet> is there any DVD drive emulator that i can use for the *bin?
[02:05] <kaur> javaJake: u aren't using the generic kernel by any chance?
[02:05] <javaJake> FreeNet, probably. Google it. :)
[02:05] <shiner421> yea it goes to some non related page
[02:05] <javaJake> kaur, yea
[02:05] <javaJake> shiner421, hmm, let me get you a direct link
[02:06] <kaur> javaJake: there seems to be a bug in it
[02:06] <halorgium> i have a "server" install of ubuntu
[02:06] <halorgium> if i want to get a "desktop" install
[02:06] <kaur> javaJake: use 686 kernel
[02:06] <halorgium> what do i need to do?
[02:06] <FreeNet> javaJake>	If telling people is the only thing you know.. then i'll say i can do a better job...
[02:06] <kaur> the goog old one
[02:06] <javaJake> kaur, mm, no, works in edgy, just not in feisty.
[02:06] <FreeNet> google.
[02:06] <johns^> FreeNet: mount -o loop <binfile> /mnt/
[02:06] <Samuli^> halorgium, sudo apt-get install (k)(x)ubuntu-desktop
[02:06] <kaur> javaJake: mine doesn't work in edgy
[02:07] <javaJake> FreeNet, I'm saying that because I know I've seen something for that for Windows in Google, so there's probably a Linux one.
[02:07] <halorgium> Samuli^: good, i'm doing that :)
[02:07] <johns^> FreeNet: but .bin files aren't often cd images.
[02:07] <kaur> javaJake: i think it's the Dual Core stuff that confuses it
[02:07] <johns^> unless it's windows :)
[02:07] <javaJake> kaur, uh, yea, I've got a P3, so no dual stuff happening here.
[02:08] <javaJake> shiner421, http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX
[02:08] <shiner421> jake, right from the start the aiglx instructions dont work for me
[02:08] <shiner421> I cannot get a key
[02:08] <FreeNet> no john... no luck
[02:08] <shiner421> it says no valid openpgp data found
[02:09] <shiner421> its got some crazy symbols in the instructions
[02:09] <javaJake> shiner421, ok, well, you don't need the key. That's just to check to be sure hackers aren't trying to get into your system. Which is one in a million.
[02:09] <johns^> FreeNet: what did you try. The mount command or sh
[02:09] <kaur> is there a channel for laptop issues?
[02:09] <shiner421> I take it I dont want experimental packages?
[02:09] <FreeNet> mount
[02:09] <daviey> FreeNet, is the bin execuatble?  Try chmod +x xxx.bin      Then ./xxx.bin
[02:09] <FreeNet> sh not working too
[02:10] <johns^> output?
[02:10] <FreeNet> can alien work?
[02:10] <daviey> FreeNet, where did you get the bin file?
[02:10] <johns^> FreeNet: it's not a cd image, just looked at the website
[02:10] <FreeNet> download from planshift's site
[02:10] <johns^> it's a binary
[02:10] <FreeNet> it
[02:10] <FreeNet> it's for debian distro
[02:11] <johns^> it doesn't end on .sh huh? so the command should be sh *bin :)
[02:11] <javaJake> OK, that's wierd. My CPU just suddenly decided it was scaled and everything works now. :P
[02:11] <prOMiNd> any know website for send free sms- in all country ?!
[02:11] <prOMiNd> Oo :)
[02:12] <FreeNet> not working for sh *bin
[02:12] <ArCHoNKoG> is there any way you can restore /var/lib/dpkg
[02:12] <klm-> are firefox 1.X:s configurations (bookmark toolbar folder and mouse gestures) transportable to Firefox 2:s config folders?
[02:12] <daviey> prOMiNd, you'll struggle to get a reliable SMS site that doesn't attach adverts for free
[02:13] <prOMiNd> huh ?
[02:13] <kaur> what would be the best way to figure out why ny laptop's cpu temp is too high? Cpu usage seems to be normal
[02:14] <FreeNet> nvm guys... i think i'll have to sort out some other time... i can't find a good newsgroup client for reading my school newsgroup either.
[02:14] <FreeNet> i have to use my slower Windows System to do it now.
[02:14] <johns^> FreeNet: Knode
[02:14] <johns^> or slrn
[02:14] <johns^> :)
[02:15] <johns^> gui or cli

[02:16] <shiner422> when I rebooted
[02:16] <silentace> how do i mount my windows drives?
[02:16] <cpk1> silentace: its writing to it that can get tricky =)
[02:16] <shiner422> everything works fine now
[02:16] <rapid> silentace: man mount
[02:16] <shiner422> so thanks a TON jake :)
[02:16] <shiner422> your the man!

[02:17] <rapid> shiner422 thats nice
[02:17] <biotrox> can anybody help me with my webcam...?
[02:17] <rapid> biotrox possibly
[02:17] <shiner422> I got lucky
[02:17] <daviey> shiner422, only if attached at initital install
[02:17] <silentace> yeah when i did the install it had them on there and i was worried it would try and mess with them
[02:18] <shiner422> ahh
[02:18] <tim167> how do i DOWNGRADE my kernel ?
[02:18] <silentace> so i took them off
[02:18] <rapid> tim167 compile the kernel you want and install it. read the kernel-howto
[02:18] <biotrox> I can detect my usb webcam
[02:18] <biotrox> don't know how to integrated it with yahoo or msn
[02:18] <biotrox> or skype
[02:18] <daviey> use /dev/video0  (or something)
[02:19] <silentace> how do i find the partition nodes?
[02:19] <tim167> rapid: the problem is: i dont know exactly which one I had, i just lost all my sounddevices after upgrading via ubuntu update notifier yesterday
[02:19] <biotrox> use /dev/video0 where..?
[02:19] <biotrox> what application..?
[02:19] <shiner422> is jake gone? or just busy?
[02:19] <shiner422> I have to go, someone give him my thanks for his patience and assistance
[02:19] <shiner422> I REALLY appreciated it! and learned a lot :)

[02:20] <silentace> new to all this... what is fstab?
[02:20] <FreeNet> how do i find my newly installed knode? why it's not in the Application Menu Link?
[02:20] <halorgium> file system table
[02:20] <rapid> silentace its where all your drivers are mounted cat /etc/fstab
[02:21] <halorgium> silentace:
[02:21] <rapid> drives sorry
[02:21] <daviey> silentace, fdisk -l will list the partitions
[02:21] <biotrox> silentace | fstab is where you mount all your partitions
[02:21] <halorgium> rapid: no, it is where the configuration for the mounting is stored
[02:21] <biotrox> !fstab
[02:21] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[02:21] <biotrox> ya i mean that
[02:21] <halorgium>  /proc/mounts show the current mounts
[02:21] <rapid> halorgium that is what I meant.
[02:21] <itsmabus> Why does my computer stop responding when I remove the keyboard?
[02:22] <biotrox> rapid | how to use the /dev/video0
[02:22] <itsmabus> ie: it can't be pinged when the keyboard comes out
[02:22] <daviey> halorgium, did what rapid say make sense?! your being pedantic
[02:22] <rapid> itsmabus thats wierd.
[02:22] <rapid> biotrox make sure the program supports it
[02:22] <halorgium> daviey: what rapid said was completely different
[02:23] <halorgium> configuration != runtime
[02:23] <biotrox> rapid i don't know what program support video webcam
[02:23] <itsmabus> rapid: Yeah, I have 4 servers like this sitting here... 1 working keyboard.
[02:23] <itsmabus> 3 problems
[02:23] <daviey> halorgium, no *completely* different
[02:23] <rapid> Its the file that has the configuration where all the drives are mounted, same thing
[02:23] <TritonX> irc.ogame.net
[02:23] <halorgium> meh
[02:23] <halorgium> i thought it was a useful clarification
[02:24] <cypher1> how can one create a bootable dvd ?
[02:24] <rapid> burn a bootable image to it
[02:24] <daviey> halorgium, i disagree
[02:24] <halorgium> that's fine :)
[02:25] <spox> what is 8001 in " tc qdisc show dev ppp0" output and how one can control it?
[02:25] <itsmabus> Where do you statically manage your ip addresses in ubuntu?
[02:25] <rapid> spox: probably the port number.. looks like a streaming port, check /etc/services
[02:25] <Rage__> itsmabus: /etc/network/interfaces
[02:26] <spox> rapid: not sure - I have 8001 8002 and 8003 for tree discipline leafs
[02:26] <cypher1> rapid: ok but how do i create a bootable image ?
[02:26] <ArCHoNKoG> is there any way you can restore /var/lib/dpkg
[02:26] <biotrox> !xawtv
[02:26] <Rage__> itsmabus: you want static instead of dhcp. man that file.
[02:26] <ubotu> xawtv: X11 TV application. In component universe, is extra. Version 3.95-4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 227 kB, installed size 656 kB
[02:26] <rapid> cypher1 use a burning tool, k3b should suffice
[02:27] <cypher1> rapid: k3b will create a bootable image from an iso ?
[02:27] <rapid> if the iso has a boot able image contained for sure
[02:27] <rapid> cypher1
[02:27] <l3mr> i have an nvidia 8800 graphics card, which is not supported by the drivers in ubuntu edgy. If I try to install the drivers using the original nvidia auto installer package, it says it can't find the X directories...any ideas on how to get nvidia installer to solve this? or are there recent drivers available pre-packaged?
[02:27] <itsmabus> Rage__: thank, got it.
[02:27] <spox> qdisc sfq 8005: parent 1:101 limit 128p quantum 12187b perturb 10sec ---------- What's "8005" ??
=== johnny_ is now known as clust0
[02:27] <rapid> l3mr take a look at nvidia site for your correct driver
[02:27] <tabman> using which utility can I extract .tgz & ps.gz files ?
[02:28] <spox> gunzup
[02:28] <l3mr> rapid: i did download the installer from there, but it cannot find the X directories it complains?
[02:28] <spox> gunzip
[02:28] <behdad> Hi folks , is there any knows that how can i get easyUbuntu ?
[02:28] <rapid> tar
[02:28] <spox> tar xvzf file.tar.gz

[02:28] <ubotu> easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[02:29] <behdad> thanks alot ,
[02:29] <age6racer> hey all... what's the command to invoke openoffice.org 2 from the terminal?
[02:29] <rickross> hi all, I have a new motherboard with a Realtek RTL8111 gigabit lan controller on it - the Edgy 64-bit install CD doesn't recognize
[02:29] <dabaR_> age6racer: oo<tab><tab>
[02:29] <jrib> age6racer: press oo<TAB><TAB>
[02:30] <rickross> is there a place to download a CD with latest 2.6.18 kernel on it already?
[02:30] <age6racer> jrib thanks
[02:30] <halorgium> rickross: are you running a core duo 2?
[02:30] <halorgium> haven't trouble getting installed?
[02:30] <HymnToLife> rickross, get Debian :)
[02:30] <dooglus> I just upgraded from dapper to edgy, and when I rebooted, my X display is corrupted and the virtual termnals are black-on-black
[02:30] <rickross> halorgium - yes, it is an E6600 on an Asus P5B-VM
[02:31] <dooglus> any suggestions?
[02:31] <halorgium> rickross: get the boot.img
[02:31] <rapid> rickross just compile the 2.6.18 kernel
[02:31] <halorgium> i went and got a usb stick and installed from that
[02:31] <uMISTA> ok apt-get says i have iptables intstall but when i trying the do /etc/init.d/iptables restart, it says its not there?
[02:32] <rickross> halorgium - is there a wiki page that describes what to do?
[02:32] <halorgium> rickross: yip
[02:32] <halorgium> it is on my winxp install
[02:32] <halorgium> which isn't booted atm
[02:32] <|markie|> during the desktop installation..  i dont have the option for a to install on a software raid.... is it possible to install or reconfigure the desktop to use software raid ?
[02:32] <halorgium> cause i'm actually just installing now!
[02:32] <halorgium> haha
=== WorkRoey is now known as Roey
[02:32] <rapid> rickross: why don't you get the source and compile it?
[02:33] <halorgium> rapid: he doesn't have an installation to do so from
[02:33] <rickross> rapid - the machine has no network conenctivity at all
[02:33] <rapid> rickross: get the boot.img then :)
[02:34] <rambo3> uMISTA man iptables
[02:34] <cdavis_> How do you get the rsa fingerprint of an  ssh server?  I mean when I ssh to it after I save the fingerprint, I dont know where to see that fingerprint anymore
[02:34] <rickross> rapid - any url that describes how to do that (haven't had to do it before)
[02:34] <uMISTA> ok apt-get says i have iptables intstall but when i trying the do /etc/init.d/iptables restart, it says its not there?
[02:34] <rapid> rickross: what distribution? ubuntu?
[02:35] <rickross> rapid - yes, Ubuntu Edgy 64-bit
[02:35] <jrib> cdavis_: ~/.ssh/known_hosts  I believe is where it is saved to
[02:35] <rambo3> uMISTA, and they never will be there
[02:35] <rapid> rickross: isn't the CD bootable?
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[02:35] <uMISTA> so why do how to tell me type such a thing in?
[02:35] <rickross> the CD is bootable - does it already have 2.6.18 kernel sources on it?
[02:36] <rapid> rickross: not sure.
[02:36] <rapid> rickross: can't you do that once its installed.
[02:36] <halorgium> rickross: no
[02:36] <dooglus> what do I need to do to get an sshd running in edgy?
[02:36] <halorgium> rapid: no, the ide channels aren't detected :/
[02:36] <dooglus> I think I've installed the 'ssh' package.  do I need to edit any config files?
[02:36] <rapid> dooglus start the deamon "sshd"
[02:36] <jrib> it shoudl start after being installed
[02:36] <cdavis_> jrib, ya but they are not the same as the one that shows up when I type ssh?  are they just in a different format?
[02:37] <rambo3> uMISTA,  sudo iptables -L and see rules , you can flush add remove
[02:37] <dooglus> rapid: my display is corrupted, so I can't see what I'm doing.  I'm hoping to run sshd so I can fix it from a different box
[02:37] <jrib> cdavis_: not sure
[02:37] <rapid> dooglus type reset
[02:37] <dooglus> rapid: the X display is corrupted - it's like each like is 10 pixels too short, so everything's skewed diagonally across the screen
[02:37] <rickross> rapid - I don't have any network at all on the machine, and I am a relative noob when it comes to getting drivers in at install time
[02:37] <rapid> dooglus: press ctrl+alt+f1
[02:38] <dooglus> rapid: the virtual console windows are all black
[02:38] <rickross> usually I have been able to just apt-get whatever I needed
[02:38] <dooglus> no white text
[02:38] <bigbro> jacquesmerde: You should not be seeing different permissions in different subdirectories. Are you mounting over SAMBA, or mounting a local FAT32 drive?
[02:38] <rapid> dooglus: restart the X server with ctrl+alt+backspace
[02:38] <jrib> cdavis_: man 8 sshd   has info on the format
[02:38] <rapid> rickross: why do you need a 2.6.18 on the box if it will have no network access etc.
[02:38] <dooglus> rapid: I have done, but it comes back the same.  upgrading from dapper to edgy did this.
[02:39] <ArCHoNKoG> which one takes up more ram kde or gnome
[02:39] <jrib> ArCHoNKoG: probably about the same
[02:39] <rickross> rapid - I understand that the required network drivers may already be present in latest 2.6.18 version
[02:39] <apokryphos> ArCHoNKoG: it's probably not worth trusting anyone's answer to that
[02:39] <_raphael_> when will openoffice 2.1 (preferably norwegian) appear in the ubuntu repo(s)?
[02:39] <dooglus> rapid: I managed to get logged in using ssh.  the magic words were "sudo /etc/init.d/sshd start"
[02:39] <Samuli^> ArCHoNKoG, to me, KDE is slightly snappier feeling
[02:39] <rapid> dooglus cool
[02:39] <halorgium> rickross: you want the url?
[02:40] <apokryphos> ArCHoNKoG: though, see http://ktown.kde.org/~seli/memory/
[02:40] <rickross> halorgium - yes, thanks
[02:40] <rapid> rickross: www.kernel.org
[02:40] <jacquesmerde> bigbro: local. i think i've screwed fat32 attributes with chmod somehow
[02:40] <usr_rob>  Which one gives best result: cdparanoia or cdda2wav ?
[02:40] <bigbro> jacquesmerde: I would say that's a distinct possibility, yes.
[02:41] <rickross> rapid - nothing more specific than that (a little like "use the internet")
[02:41] <rapid> rickross: whats wrong?
[02:41] <halorgium> rickross: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1805806
[02:41] <halorgium> nearer the bottom
[02:41] <bigbro> jacquesmerde: Try umounting and remounting it? Have you got any overlaid filesystems?
[02:41] <halorgium> have you got a window box?
[02:41] <dooglus> rapid: running a dpkg-reconfigure and accepting all the default values fixed it, too, so it's strange that the upgrade broke it!
[02:41] <rickross> rapid - nothing wrong, it's just a very general url - not particular to my question
[02:41] <halorgium> cause the boot.img you'll need to get the files on a linux box
[02:42] <halorgium> or someone could extract and zip em for ya
[02:42] <IMYojimbo> hi
[02:42] <rickross> what about prelim versions of Feisty?
[02:43] <apokryphos> what about it?
[02:43] <rickross> how stable is ubuntu in early stages of next release?
[02:43] <itsmabus> rapid: and now, even with a kvm switch... switching from one computer to the other with the scroll lock X2, up key combo freezes BOTH machines
[02:43] <IMYojimbo> Is someone arround here bored enough to team up and develop something?
[02:43] <apokryphos> rickross: it varies between releases. Edgy was very unstable throughout. Fesity of course will be very unstable now and for the upcoming few months
[02:44] <itsmabus> IMYojimbo: Probably not the best place to ask... ;) Why, what are you interested in?
[02:44] <rickross> so it's better to simply get latest kernel into a stock Edgy install?
[02:44] <IMYojimbo> itsmabus: i don't know, something in java maybe..? :)
[02:45] <jacquesmerde> bigbro: mounting and unmounting? i've deleted the entire linux distro that had mounted it, and reinstalled linux
[02:45] <itsmabus> IMYojimbo: I don't know a lick of anything outside of perl. Not that I'm unwilling to learn.
[02:45] <itsmabus> /join #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:45] <IMYojimbo> itsmabus: you've got any ideas?
[02:45] <rizhun> ok, i've read the stuff on the wiki and downloaded the windows driver for my wireless card. i've installed it with ndiswrapper. but when i run a 'ndiswrapper -l' it says invalid driver..
[02:45] <bigbro> jacquesmerde: ANd what are you seeing?
[02:45] <bigbro> jacquesmerde: What permissions are wrong?
[02:46] <rizhun> if i look at the ndisgtk it says no hardware
[02:46] <rizhun> but i can see the card in an lspci...
[02:46] <itsmabus> IMYojimbo: /join #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:46] <rizhun> can anyone tell me where i'm going wrong here?
[02:46] <jacquesmerde> the writability permissions. i just chmod'ed them all writable, i just hope it fixed the fat32 attributes
[02:47] <dooglus> !info apt-file
[02:47] <ubotu> apt-file: APT package searching utility -- command-line interface. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0.8ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 12 kB, installed size 96 kB
[02:47] <frogzoo> jacquesmerde: chmod doesn't work with fat32 - use mount options instead
[02:47] <dooglus> aah - universe..  I was forgetting about that...
[02:48] <pablo> hi, i have a problem, my machine detects the wireless but it says disconected, with the live cd it worked correctly
[02:48] <ReTyPe> i dont have the powerdown button anymore, how do i readd it to the shutdwon/logoff window ?
[02:48] <jacquesmerde> frogzoo: chmod MUST do soemthing to fat32 ouside the mount. its the ONLY way this makes sense
[02:49] <dooglus> pablo: are you using a 686 kernel?
[02:49] <rizhun> can anyone help me to get ubuntu to recognise my wireless card?
[02:49] <dooglus> pablo: the live CD worked for me (with a 386 kernel) and won't connect to my wireless card if I use a 686 kernel
[02:49] <jrib> jacquesmerde: the permissions won't be there next time you mount
[02:50] <pablo> dooglus: yes something similar, but where do i chose the kernel
[02:50] <jacquesmerde> jrib: they must be. they even withstand a complete deleting of linux
[02:50] <frogzoo> jacquesmerde: pass 'umask=0000' as an option in /etc/fstab & remount
[02:50] <dooglus> pablo: at boot time, hit escape to see the menu
[02:51] <jacquesmerde> nah, i dont do stuff i dont understand
[02:51] <pablo> dooglus: once ubuntu installed?
[02:51] <chibiace> anybody got a screwdriver?
[02:51] <rizhun> dooglus, you can choose which kernel to run at startup?
[02:52] <jrib> jacquesmerde: what does "that" mean exactly?  What permissions?
[02:52] <vlt> Hello. I installed lvm2 via aptitude. When I try to execute one of lvm's commands in /sbin/ (that btw. are all symlinks to a binary called lvmperversion or similar) an error msg "No program lvfoobar found for your current version of LVM" appears. What does it mean?

[02:52] <ubotu> jacquesmerde: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[02:53] <pablo> dooglus: so ubuntu live cd uses 386 kernel and it installs a 686 kernel and thats why with the live cd it works and once installed not?
[02:53] <k3k0> hola alguien ke hable espaol
[02:53] <dooglus> pablo: once it's installed, yes.  it will install the 'grub' boot loader.  as it starts booting, it'll day "esc for menu" and count down (from 3 I think).  hit esc to see a list of installed kernels
[02:53] <ProN00b> jacquesmerde, seriously chmod doesn't work on fat32 because it simply doesn't support it
[02:53] <dooglus> pablo: I don't know if it installs a 386 or 686 kernel by default, and I don't know if you're having the same problem as me, either.
[02:54] <jacquesmerde> well, SOMEthing in linux seems to alter native fat32 attributes. its the only thing that would explain it...
[02:54] <jrib> jacquesmerde: what are the native fat32 attributes you are talking about?
[02:54] <pablo> dooglus: ok thanks, i will try
[02:54] <ProN00b> jacquesmerde, as a workarround some default set of chmod are displayed/used, which are set when the partition is mounted
[02:55] <jacquesmerde> that allocated bit in files in fat32
[02:55] <frogzoo> jacquesmerde: nope - once fat's mounted, linux assumes all files have the same permission
[02:56] <jacquesmerde> i've mounted a fat32 partition, and obviously changed attributes to the fat32 partition, coz when i unmounted, deleted linux, reinstalled, remounted, the permissions were the same, and fat32 aint get no permissions
[02:56] <ProN00b> jacquesmerde, look in /etc/fstab (for example, my fat32 disk has defaults,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 as options (umask is chmod))

=== _psych[0]  is now known as psych[0] 
[02:56] <pablo> dooglus: there is only one type of kernel
[02:56] <ProN00b> well, the archive bit could change, dunno about that, but the permissions don't change
[02:57] <jacquesmerde> ProN00b: the problem is with different directories inside the partition having different "permissions", fstab mounts the partition wholesale
[02:57] <ProN00b> jacquesmerde, what is the problem ?
[02:57] <ProN00b> jacquesmerde, that can't happen, all dirs+files on the disk should have the same permissions once mounted
[02:57] <dooglus> pablo: the other thing to make sure is that you have the corresponding 'linux-restricted-modules-...' kernel installed.
[02:58] <gnu> hi when I try to copy files from a dvd in some cases it says: error i/o when copying

[03:00] <jacquesmerde> ProN00b: EXACTLY! but thats not what happened!!!
[03:00] <jacquesmerde> ProN00b: the mount must have been responding to fat32 attributes

[03:01] <vlt> vlt: When you try to execute one of lvm's commands and an error msg "No program lvfoobar found for your current version of LVM" appears it could be because of a kernel compiled w/o LVM support ;-)

[03:02] <jacquesmerde> man, i'm 404'ing on easyubuntu's gpg thingy. this temporary?
[03:02] <lnx^_> it's a freeware ttf font so i guess it should be possible to install it somehow

[03:39] <ThePub> nzhomie: I'm just guessing, but maybe it's part of the "ifplugd" package.  If you've installed it already and it's not there, then why'd you remove it? :)
[03:39] <john76> why would you use a visual editor in linux? if your on linux don't you know better

[03:44] <erchache> is it secure? or need to change hard disk?
[03:44] <rizhun> I got the theme from gnome-look.org

[03:48] <aberry> well I know about the optimized kernels and all that, it's just that when I stick the cd in and let it boot up in to live cd mode, whether it's on safe graphics or not, it will get most of the way there, then the screen will go funny looking, a dodgy green line cuts across the screen and it doesnt go any further than that
[03:48] <HymnToLife> biotrox, I know Kopete does but it's more a KDE app
[03:48] <HymnToLife> will work just fine in GNOME though

[03:48] <aberry> I know it's still responding, however, because when I go to turn it off it will still send all the halt commands and turn of the pc properly
[03:48] <biotrox> mmmm

[03:49] <erchache> push e and edit line
[03:49] <nzhomie> yahoo or msn ?
[03:49] <erchache> do you have a pci-e graphic card or agp?
[03:49] <biotrox> need yahoo more than msn
[03:49] <biotrox> both is better
[03:50] <aberry> erchache: so allow it to boot on to live cd then press e? I have pci-e 16
[03:50] <erchache> if is pci-e perhaps your motherboard are unsupported yet
[03:50] <erchache> in this case get server install cd with is on command line mode

[03:54] <biotrox> but need to make webcam works for yahoo and messenger
[03:55] <biotrox> msn i mean
[03:55] <HymnToLife> aberry, the DEsktop is what you tried, the installable Live CD. The Ser'ver just installs a very basic system and thel lets you install whatever you want
[03:55] <nzhomie> hymn to life : it has no k in it ???
[03:55] <HymnToLife> between them there is the Alternate, same as the Desktop but the installer is text-based
[03:55] <nzhomie> does it not support webcam ?
[03:55] <HymnToLife> so it's less pretty but also far less likely to fail on you, I suggest you try this :)
[03:56] <aberry> hymntolife: is there anyway of starting the desktop version without x? I'd rather not have to completely install the distro from scratch
[03:56] <erchache> aberry:
[03:56] <erchache> yeah....you have two ways
[03:56] <nzhomie> if off to bed guys
[03:56] <biotrox> nzhomie gaim doesn't support webcam :(
[03:56] <nzhomie> ouch
[03:56] <nzhomie> u sure aMSN is 22mb?
[03:56] <HymnToLife> aberry, boot in recovery mode and edit your X config file to use the vesa driver
[03:56] <erchache> 1- more easy....wait until livecd gets your video card.....very lame
[03:57] <aberry> yes but surely when I do that it will forget the changes when I reboot
[03:57] <nzhomie> GOODNIGHT !
[03:57] <erchache> 2- more funny...install server mode ubuntu....compile your own code.....install X.org
[03:57] <HymnToLife> nzhomie, amsn itself is 2.2 MiB
[03:57] <biotrox> amsn is 15MB with a lot of ++ of libs
[03:57] <HymnToLife> but it is written in Tcl so you'll need to download the Tcl interpreter to run amsn
[03:57] <aberry> if recovery mode is the same as basic graphics mode I have already tried, and it does the same thing
[03:57] <HymnToLife> which is significantly bigger
[03:57] <erchache> the cool guys gets way 2 :-D
[03:57] <biotrox> 2MB if amsn only
[03:58] <HymnToLife> aberry, nope, the recovery mode is comand line only
[03:58] <erchache> aberry if you want i can pass a list of packages needed to compile your own kernel
[03:58] <erchache> its more easy than you know
[03:58] <aberry> hymntolife: how to I start it in recovery mode from the live cd? and do I need to use a usb stick to remember boto settings?
[03:59] <aberry> erchache, really?
[03:59] <erchache> all people afraid with kernel panics...but....with little experience you can solve it
[03:59] <HymnToLife> aberry, does the Live CD in "safe graphics" work ?
[03:59] <HymnToLife> if so, it will be a bit more easy
[03:59] <aberry> hymntolife, no, it does the same as it does otherwise
[03:59] <erchache> i get kernel panic a lot! but....i get a lot of experience with this
[03:59] <HymnToLife> all right so forget the Live CD
[03:59] <littlesniper> hello I wanted to install ubuntu on two machines
[03:59] <HymnToLife> boot your Ubuntu from your HD in recovery mode
[03:59] <littlesniper> on the first one no problem
[04:00] <erchache> if you want to learn ubuntu/linux sysadmin....you MUST to learn to compile your own personalized kernel
[04:00] <aberry> I cant, it isnt installed yet :S
[04:00] <quad3datwork2> anyone messed with ZoneCD before? i'm wondering if there is a lighter solution, any suggestions are appreciated
[04:00] <HymnToLife> aberry, oh right
[04:00] <HymnToLife> get an Alternate CD then :)
[04:00] <littlesniper> on the second one I get back to the login every 10 secondes or so when trying to do the installation
[04:00] <erchache> step 1- install ubuntu edgy for servers
[04:00] <aberry> erchache, could I do that on another distro?
[04:00] <aberry> oh ok
[04:00] <erchache> step 2- configure your network card
[04:00] <littlesniper> the ubuntu installation is going crazy on this computer, any idea ?
[04:01] <erchache> step 3- modify /etc/apt/sources.list for get packages from internet
[04:01] <erchache> step 4 - upgrade your system
[04:01] <erchache> step 5 - install all packages needed for compile kernel
[04:01] <erchache> step 6 (more tedious) - make your own kernel without kernel panics
[04:01] <littlesniper> hmmmm

[04:03] <qos> hey guys ... it there anyone who can help me with sound problems?
[04:03] <littlesniper> when I try to install ubuntu on one of my machines, the installation is getting mad going back to the login every 10 seconds or so. Does anyone has met this issue please ?
[04:04] <DaDiablo> I have the following problem: Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device. Anyone know what i have to do?
[04:04] <HymnToLife> DaDiablo, use another one :)
[04:04] <aberry> erchache, that sounds simple in like six sentences but I don't think I have enough knowledge to do it :p especially since my network card is wifi so I need ndiswrapper and I have NO idea how that would work in command line :p
[04:04] <HymnToLife> I assume you get that when trying to play something in mplayer
[04:05] <DaDiablo> yes
[04:05] <erchache> ubotu: these graphic card is pci-e is a motherboard chipset problem
[04:05] <Pelo> I need someone to look up a link in the alacarte menu editor for me,  I was enabling something but I fucked up and deleted it instead,  I need the proper command
[04:05] <HymnToLife> aberry, just try an Alternate CD
[04:05] <jrib> !language | Pelo
[04:05] <ubotu> Pelo: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[04:05] <jrib> Pelo: what command?
[04:06] <erchache> step 7 - if you gets a stable kernel for your system....take a beer for your good work :-D
[04:06] <frogzoo> Pelo: which?
[04:06] <aberry> hymntolife, you mean ther server one?
[04:06] <HymnToLife> no
[04:06] <HymnToLife> the Alternate
[04:06] <Pelo> jrib,  the comman for the OO  model thingy , it is not enabled by default
[04:06] <erchache> step 8 - install X.org and additionals packages
[04:06] <buzzy> sorry people can you say me if i have set well my grub? I would like to be able to boot windows partition. i have pasted fdisk -l and menu.lst content: http://rafb.net/paste/results/mSEqJT58.html
[04:06] <buzzy> HymnToLife,
[04:06] <HymnToLife> there are three CDs, DEsktop, Alternate and Server
[04:06] <aberry> ok, ill take a look at that
[04:06] <erchache> aberry: get server install cd
[04:06] <erchache> server is like livecd but without X system
[04:07] <garoto> que haces??
[04:07] <jrib> Pelo: I have nothing with the word "model" in the office menu (in alacarte)
[04:07] <jrib> !es | garoto
[04:07] <ubotu> garoto: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[04:07] <aberry> I know kde works on another distro, should I try the kubuntu live cd or do you think I would get the same problems
[04:07] <buzzy> HymnToLife,  can you help me please?
[04:08] <Pelo> jrib,  might be template,    new Open office doc from template or something
[04:08] <HymnToLife> aberry, you will get exactly the same
[04:08] <erchache> aberry: you have same problem
[04:08] <jrib> Pelo: oofromtemplate %U    is the command
[04:08] <HymnToLife> it has nothing to do with GNOME or KDE
[04:08] <erchache> you need to upgrade your kernel to get pci-e support
[04:08] <Pelo> jrib,  thanks
[04:08] <HymnToLife> !ask | buzzy
[04:08] <ubotu> buzzy: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:08] <garoto> te luce el verde
[04:08] <erchache> and with this you can get video card support
[04:08] <aberry> hymntolife & erchache: ok, I can see the server but not th alternate on the site
[04:08] <HymnToLife> hmm
[04:08] <erchache> get server
[04:09] <erchache> and follow my steps
[04:09] <ValMarko> Hi there :) sudo -i gives me permanent permission to the terminal. What command should I typo to have permission to all the task of the system ?
[04:09] <aberry> erchache, if I didnt get this would it mean I might have problems running 3d apps?
[04:09] <Criss> hola leooooooooooooo
[04:09] <erchache> no...you cant use X
[04:09] <buzzy> HymnToLife,  i wrote this:
[04:09] <aberry> erchache, I meant after x is installed
[04:09] <buzzy> sorry people can you say me if i have set well my grub? I would like to be able to boot windows partition. i have pasted fdisk -l and menu.lst content: http://rafb.net/paste/results/mSEqJT58.html
[04:09] <leoely> hola
[04:09] <erchache> ahh no
[04:10] <erchache> you can get all opengl functionalities
[04:10] <Criss> nou spanish
[04:10] <erchache> dejad de dar la vara
[04:10] <erchache> usad ubuntu-es
[04:10] <HymnToLife> buzzy, yep, that will work
[04:10] <aberry> erchahe, only asking because I have had problems with it on another distro :p
[04:10] <garoto> como estan ustedes  los de fundacite
[04:10] <buzzy> ok hybrid  that says me: NTLDR is missing :S
[04:10] <erchache> this isnt important
[04:10] <aberry> erchache it sounds all good and well but I have a feeling it's a little out of my league, Im sure theres more to it than what you just said
[04:11] <HymnToLife> buzzy, did you fixboot c: in Win XP recovery console as I told you ?
[04:11] <erchache> aberry: its a normal problem...because pci-e support are very newer
[04:11] <erchache> dont get afraid for this
[04:11] <erchache> with little patiente and luck you can solve it
[04:11] <erchache> what chipset do you have intel?
[04:12] <erchache> is a intel core duo or amd machine?
[04:12] <buzzy> HymnToLife,  i have windows 2k and i tried it but it fails!! :S
[04:12] <aberry> erchache, I imagine it'd be possible but if I screw it up it would be insanely difficult to understand my mistakes
[04:12] <buzzy> what to do?
[04:12] <rapid> core duo
[04:12] <aberry> it's a via chipset, amd 3800+
[04:12] <rapid> could be amd I guess
[04:12] <stefg> buzzy: The section in /boot/grub/menu.lst is correct (only the comment is wrong). So you reinstalled windows and lost grub from the MBR... see !grub for help
[04:12] <HymnToLife> buzzy, sorry, can't help you with 2k
[04:12] <erchache> ahh dont worry
[04:13] <erchache> with make menuconfig you have a ncurses menu
[04:13] <erchache> very easy to configure
[04:13] <aberry> lol :p no offence erchache but I've never done it before, and other than eight sentences I wouldnt know how
[04:13] <erchache> a first time was ever! :-D
[04:13] <aberry> for a start how would I configure a wifi card without x?
[04:14] <HymnToLife> aberry, try the Alternate...
[04:14] <aberry> and I have already tried, and failed, to find proper drivers
[04:14] <stefg> sudo vim /etc/network interfaces
[04:14] <erchache> yeah
[04:14] <aberry> hymntolife where is it?
[04:14] <HymnToLife> same place you got your Desktop CD from most likely
[04:14] <HymnToLife> it it isn't there, try another mirror
[04:15] <aberry> it isn't anywhere obvious on the ubuntu website :S
[04:15] <aberry> ok
[04:15] <fenrig> can sombody help me
[04:15] <erchache> aberry: did you try with alternate? i dont see it before...
[04:15] <stefg> !ask
[04:15] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:15] <aberry> erchache, no I ididnt
[04:15] <erchache> hymmtolife: thanks for your advice ;-)
[04:15] <erchache> hymntolife
[04:16] <ValMarko> I want to install seamonkey but I dont have all the permissions to write files to a givem directory.  What command should I type to have all the permissions ?
[04:16] <erchache> The alternate install CD allows you to perform certain specialist installations of Ubuntu. It provides for the following situations:
[04:16] <erchache>     * creating pre-configured OEM systems;
[04:16] <erchache>     * setting up automated deployments;
[04:16] <erchache>     * upgrading from older installations without network access;
[04:16] <erchache>     * LVM and/or RAID partitioning;
[04:16] <erchache>     * installing GRUB to a location other than the Master Boot Record;
[04:16] <erchache>     * installs on systems with less than about 192MB of RAM.
[04:16] <aberry> ok I have a fair few, would you reccomend 64 bit
[04:16] <aberry> and before Im asked a silly question, I do have a 64 bit processor :p

[04:16] <erchache> vale vale :-D
[04:16] <kanzie> I have just installed Edgy on my IBM Thinkpad T60 that is equipped with ATI graphics. Which driver should I use?
[04:17] <aberry> kanzie, get proprietary from ati.com
[04:17] <erchache> aberry: http://mirror.lupaworld.com/ubuntu/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-amd64.iso
[04:17] <erchache> use that
[04:17] <aberry> erchache, cheers
[04:17] <protocol1> how do I extract a .gz file?
[04:17] <protocol1> example?
[04:17] <erchache> tar zxfv file.gfz
[04:17] <DaDiablo> I have the following problem: Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device. Anyone know what i have to do?
[04:17] <kanzie> aberry, When I last installed Beryl on this machine (running Dapper) I was encouraged to use unofficial drivers
[04:17] <ValMarko> Is Pentium 4 a 64 bits processor?
[04:17] <HymnToLife> protocol1, tar.gz or somethingelse.gz ?
[04:18] <HymnToLife> ValMarko, no
[04:18] <erchache> valmarko: you need to see emt64 at boot to get a intel pentium 4 64 bits
[04:18] <frogzoo> ValMarko: 32
[04:18] <syock> why is it that everytime people teach the usage of tar they use all those flags?
[04:18] <protocol1> HymnToLife, somethingelse.gz
[04:18] <HymnToLife> protocol1, gunzip
[04:18] <ValMarko> tanks
[04:18] <protocol1> ok
[04:18] <frogzoo> syock: man tar
[04:18] <aberry> kanzie, it is good to support GNU but, realistically, the proprietary drivers are better, if only because ati, dont let people know how their cards work properly
[04:19] <ValMarko> What processor from intel is a 64 bit
[04:19] <DaDiablo> I have the following problem: Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device. Anyone know what i have to do?
[04:19] <kanzie> Should I install anything extra to the kernel to get support for DualCore?
[04:19] <erchache> intel core duo
[04:19] <kanzie> aberry, True true...
[04:19] <frogzoo> kanzie: beryl is only supported for the open source driver - not ati
[04:19] <aberry> kanzie, there are dual core kernels
[04:19] <erchache> kanzie: use amd64 ubuntu version
[04:19] <HymnToLife> kanzie, in Edgy, no, in DApper : linux-686-smp
[04:19] <sysrage> syock: habbit.. i always use zxpvf.. why do i use p or v? cause that's the first way i was ever tought.. no i dont need them :)
[04:19] <ValMarko> beryl is very nice. I just installed it yesterday
[04:20] <HymnToLife> erchache, and for 32 bit dual cores ?
[04:20] <erchache> ubuntu normal
[04:20] <erchache> and get smp kernel from apt
[04:20] <kanzie> HymnToLife, Im running Edgy since an hour ago, so no fiddeling around to get both cores up and running?
[04:20] <biotrox> !gyach
[04:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gyach - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:20] <frogzoo> ValMarko: are you running the fglrx driver ?
[04:20] <biotrox> !gayachi
[04:20] <HymnToLife> kanzie, nope
[04:20] <erchache> more /proc/cpuinfo
[04:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gayachi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:20] <HymnToLife> you can check it by running   cat /proc/cpuinfo
[04:20] <aberry> kanzie, open uo synaptic and type in kernel
[04:20] <erchache> with this see number of cpu cores
[04:20] <HymnToLife> you'll see the two cores are recognized
[04:20] <ValMarko> I'm using the open source driver that comes with edgy
[04:21] <aberry> at least in other distros it should have a list of newer and modified kernels or kernel headers that are specific to certain types of machines
[04:21] <kanzie> frogzoo, Will I have any problems with beryl if I use the driver from ATI.com?
[04:21] <cpk1> i am trying to use debuild but it is stopping due to debian/rules? anyone able to help?
[04:21] <HymnToLife> aberry, Ubuntu used to have different kernels too but in Edgy they merged lots of them in the "generic" kernel
[04:22] <aberry> kanzie, no it just means that you supposedly aren't entitled to support, you can always switch back and ask :p
[04:22] <erchache> aberry yeah like gentoo
[04:22] <protocol1> how do I run an executable file in console?
[04:23] <aberry> hymtolife and erchache oh right, Ive been using PClinuxOS, basically mandriva, and it has a whole list which do actually work alot better than the original "generic" kernel
[04:23] <Pelo> protocol1,  just type the name of the file in
[04:23] <ValMarko> I'm not an expert but... if you have edgy you wont need  to make any replacement for the driver. The system comes already with an open source driver for ati. As I said, I just installed Beryl yesterday and everything works fine
[04:23] <datil> hi
[04:23] <erchache> ./executablefile
[04:24] <buzzy> guys i booted linux with printer switched off, now i need to print but it is not mounted ...what is the correct way to print? (a webpage from firefox)
[04:24] <HymnToLife> !hi | datil
[04:24] <ubotu> datil: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:24] <datil> is 6.10 release actually working with Core 2 Duo motherboards?
[04:24] <aberry> erchache, im gonna find another distro, it's downloading at 4kbs :S
[04:24] <erchache> use bittorrent
[04:24] <erchache> and wait
[04:24] <erchache> datil: yes with amd64 ubuntu distro
[04:25] <datil> erchache, why with the amd64?
[04:25] <HymnToLife> 32 bits will work fine too
[04:25] <erchache> because has 64 bits
[04:25] <stefg> !cups | buzzy
[04:25] <ubotu> buzzy: Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[04:25] <truz_`24> how do you bring up the processes screen?
[04:25] <datil> i heard that standard i386 had problems with JMicron controller and probably ICH8
[04:25] <HymnToLife> datil, if you want 64 bits support, which has little to no use atm
[04:25] <datil> optical drive not being detected, etc
[04:25] <truz_`24> I thought it was ctrl+alt+p
[04:25] <stefros> hallo
[04:25] <aberry> erchache, dont worry bittorrent is fast but the UK mirrors are serving me at like 300kbs so theres no point :p
[04:25] <datil> no, not really looking for 64bits
[04:25] <erchache> ubuntu amd64 has support for opteron, amd64 and emt64
[04:25] <erchache> emt64 is intel core duo
[04:26] <datil> talking about the JMicron / ICH8 problem with 6.10, i'm not sure if it's fixed with the lattest daily build
[04:26] <HymnToLife> aberry, try another mirror
[04:26] <ValMarko> Well, I know the system is not using all the potencial of my graphics card but I prefer it working well instead of exploring unknown fields and destroy the castle I builted
[04:26] <datil> which seems being the 25th October
[04:26] <truz_`24> The system monitor, no pre-defined shortcut for it?
[04:26] <stefros> I am having trouble activating my PRO/Wireless LAN 2100 3B Mini PCI
[04:26] <aberry> hymntolife Ive found a decent enough one, thanks
[04:26] <stefros> under Ubuntu 6.06
[04:26] <xamox> I am trying to do SSH shared public keys, I have given the public key to the server, but when I triy to connect it keeps saying that the server is not on my known_host list, what do I need to do?
[04:26] <kanzie> how on earth can I find out what card is in my laptop to get the right drivers from ati.com?
[04:26] <erchache> stefros: use goolge and sear before please
[04:26] <egenesis> hola
[04:26] <stefros> also my Radio switches
[04:27] <egenesis> alguien entendido en kdevelop???
[04:27] <HymnToLife> kanzie, lspci -n
[04:27] <HymnToLife> !es | egenesis
[04:27] <ubotu> egenesis: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[04:27] <stefros> I have used google but some problems
[04:27] <stefros> I am new to Linux
[04:27] <egenesis> ok
[04:27] <erchache> xamox: cat your_server_key >> /userhome/.ssh/autorized_keys2
[04:27] <aberry> stefros, if you are just having trouble with the card then try installing NDISwrapper and using the windows drivers
[04:28] <aberry> ndiswrapper is for wifi, it works by "wrapping" windows drivers so they work in linux
[04:28] <stefros> is it difficult to install it ?
[04:28] <HymnToLife> not much but what card do you have ?
[04:28] <aberry> stefros not at all, on my second day of using linux I figured it out :p
[04:28] <kanzie> HymnToLife, mohaha, that just gave me a list of numbers, if I had that matrix-vision I might be able to work something out...
[04:28] <erchache> well i need to back to my real job
[04:28] <erchache> bye!
[04:28] <ValMarko> My system is configured to agp mode=1. How can I change to a higher one? should I ?
[04:28] <stefros> but there is another problems due to the wireless card
[04:28] <aberry> bye ercache, cheers for the help
[04:28] <stefros> I also have radio switches
[04:28] <ValMarko> system= ubuntu
[04:29] <erchache> you are welcome
[04:29] <aberry> stefros, radio switches?
[04:29] <HymnToLife> kanzie, my mistake, drop the -n :p
[04:29] <DaDiablo> I have the following problem: Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device. Anyone know what i have to do?
[04:29] <stefros> buttons for activating my wlan card
[04:29] <erchache> if you get your machine run with ubuntu its the best reward! :-D
[04:29] <stefros> i am using amilo m 7400 laptop
[04:29] <erchache> DIE windows!
[04:29] <erchache> bye...
[04:29] <aberry> stefros, I don't know if theres any way around that, hopefully they're hardware driven though I doubt it
[04:30] <daviey> Anybody know how to make VLC work onroot
[04:30] <aberry> if they are software driven, bar writing your own drivers or checking the manufactures website for linux drivers, I dont think youll have much luck, but you never know ndiswrapper might sort that out too
[04:30] <aberry> I highly doubt it though
[04:30] <HymnToLife> VLC on root ?
[04:30] <shinda> Hey was wondering if someone could help me with curlftpfs
[04:30] <HymnToLife> that sounds like a bad idea to me
[04:30] <HymnToLife> !anyone | shinda
[04:30] <ubotu> shinda: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:30] <daviey> HymnToLife, paint to root
[04:30] <kanzie> HymnToLife, hmm... I think something is wrong. My graphics-card sure is not installed (lagging windows and such, can only set resolution to 1024 etc.) and lspci gave me: VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 7149
[04:31] <stefros> Okay, I am going to check this out
[04:31] <stefros> thx
[04:31] <HymnToLife> !ati | kanzie
[04:31] <ubotu> kanzie: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:31] <aberry> no prob
[04:31] <HymnToLife> ttry these instead of the drivers from ati.com
[04:31] <psyoptik> random question....I want to upgrade my dapper box to edgy but I was wondering whether edgy is stable enough for everysay desktop use (ie. low chance of breakage)?
[04:32] <shinda> I'm trying to mount an ftp folder using curlftpfs, Problem I'm getting is when I mount a folder I have to switch into root, I've tried setting the group/user id so that my normal login can get access to the folder but I always get permission denied when I try to access the folder after exiting root and ideas?
[04:33] <aberry> kanzie try the proprietary drivers, I had the same problem using either vesa or radeon fbdev drivers and original kernel
[04:33] <aberry> you cant do anything about the kernel but get the drivers, it helped in my case, and my graphics card is just plain awkward!
[04:33] <psyoptik> is it a stupid question to ask whether the current version of edgy is stable for everyday use?
[04:34] <aberry> psyoptik, it is stable enough I think, you just have to look at it this way, even if it has got glitches it CANT be as bad as windows :p
[04:35] <aberry> but if you're worried download the older distro with the longer guaranteed support
[04:35] <datil> is it stable/safe to use daily (current) builds of 7.4 release?
[04:35] <apokryphos> !feisty
[04:35] <ubotu> The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule - Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty - Help in #ubuntu+1
[04:36] <dreamer> how can I set THunderbird as my default mail-client?
[04:36] <psyoptik> aberry, this is very true.
[04:36] <dreamer> right now everything is opened by evolution, but I don't want that
[04:36] <aberry> hehe
[04:36] <G4BR13L> g

[04:37] <biotrox> how to forge ubuntu to be a faster OS
[04:37] <aberry> anyway Id best be off for now, cheers everyone for your help
[04:37] <kavit>  this ----> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37006/   is causing HAL/DBUS to not load/recognise my DVD RAM drive... any ideas?
[04:39] <shinda> any got any ideas about my curlftpfs problem? Basically what I'm doing to mount the folder is swtiching into root then curlftpfs -u user="user:pass",gid=1000 ftp.url.com folder/
[04:39] <shinda> but once i exit root I can't access folder
[04:39] <besucher> Heyho Mikelo
[04:39] <dreamer> how can I remove/disable evolution? in Synaptic it says ubuntu-desktop will also be removed, I just want to disable evolution so that when I clkick on a mail:bla@bla.bla link it will open in thunderbird
[04:40] <HeathenDan> you can set thunderbird to be your default client
[04:41] <nothlit> dreamer, system -> preferences -> preferred applications
[04:41] <Samuli^> dreamer, ubuntu-desktop it just a meta-package, nothing as itself it just depends on a whole lot of stuff so that when you install package ubuntu-desktop you will get the needed packages.
[04:41] <dreamer> nothlit: sorry, I am in KDE
[04:41] <Samuli^> so no harm done removing ubuntu-desktop
[04:41] <dreamer> ok :)
[04:41] <nothlit> dreamer, so you're using kubuntu-desktop?
[04:41] <dreamer> I guess ?
[04:42] <dreamer> I installed the default dapper ubuntu install (not kubuntu(, but installed kde later
[04:43] <DFM> I need some help with grub.
[04:43] <dreamer> I will remove evolution with synaptic
[04:44] <DFM> I have reinstalled ubuntu and now my brub version is 0.97 instead of 1.5
[04:45] <DFM> when I boot it doesn't highlight anything so it's hard to know which kernel or OS you are selecting
=== roovis is now known as Hiryu
[04:45] <ericmoritz\0> eek, my swap has stopped working
=== Hiryu is now known as roovis
[04:45] <erUSUL> DFM: there is no grub 1.5 afaik 0.97 is default version (maybe you see loading stage 1.5 on boot and assumed it was the grub version but it is not)
[04:45] <DFM> Where do I need to look to learn how to upgrade or install a newer version of grub?
[04:45] <DFM> true
[04:46] <DFM> why is it so different than before?
[04:46] <erUSUL> !grub | DFM
[04:46] <ubotu> DFM: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[04:46] <shinda> anyone got any ideas on how to make the folders mounted with curlftpfs accessible to users other then just root?
[04:46] <DFM> thanks
[04:46] <richiefrich> shinda: chown
[04:46] <richiefrich> shinda: chmod
[04:46] <nothlit> shinda, chown the folder before you mount it
[04:47] <nothlit> shinda, otherwise, you can also use uid,gid
[04:47] <VSpike> ericmoritz\0: mine did the same
[04:47] <shinda> I've tried using uid,gid but still get the problems
[04:47] <ericmoritz\0> VSpike, did it just stop mounting it?
[04:48] <VSpike> ericmoritz\0: pretty much. I had a few different problems.
[04:48] <richiefrich> shinda: how is it being mounted?
[04:48] <shinda> curlftpfs -u user="user:pass",gid=1000 ftp.url.com folder/ is what I used to mount it
[04:48] <shinda> but I did tat as root
[04:48] <nothlit> DFM, you can change the colors in grub, see the grub manual
[04:48] <richiefrich> shinda: after it is mounted show me a  -->  mount | grep  folder
[04:48] <ericmoritz\0> I was able to recreate the swap partition and get it mounting again but it doesn't seem to use it much
[04:49] <VSpike> ericmoritz\0: mine never gets used.  I didn't have one for ages and I didn't notice any difference.
[04:49] <nothlit> not mount -t curlftp -o user=?,uid=1000,gid=1000?
[04:50] <richiefrich> nothlit: y our way will work .. idk what he did
[04:50] <shinda> richiefrich -> curlftpfs on /home/shinda/ftpfolder type fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev)

[04:51] <noobixor> hi, how can i scale down cpu frequency in my laptop?
[04:51] <shinda> let me try that again
[04:51] <richiefrich> shinda: add users
[04:51] <nothlit> !applets | noobixor
[04:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about applets - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:52] <LjL> !gdesklets | perhaps
[04:52] <ubotu> perhaps: gDesklets provides an advanced architecture for desktop applets -- tiny displays sitting on your desktop in a symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness. Homepage is http://gdesklets.gnomedesktop.org/
[04:52] <nothlit> noobixor, theres a cpu frequency applet, right click on the menu/launch bar and choose add applet, then add the cpu frequency applet
[04:52] <nothlit> LjL, gdesklets seem resource intensive
[04:52] <shinda> richiefrich - i tried using the -o uid=1000 option but I'm setting getting no userid, how can I add a user after I mounted the folder using curl?
[04:52] <LjL> nothlit: i was just guessing, it was the only factoid containing the word "applet", i thought it was what you were thinking about
[04:53] <richiefrich> LjL  thats an app -->   cpufreqd
[04:53] <nothlit> LjL, oh I meant gnome-panel applets
[04:53] <noobixor> nothlit, can i scale smaller than this -> cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies
[04:53] <noobixor> 1667000 1333000 1000000
[04:53] <richiefrich> shinda: add in your cmd  -o users
[04:53] <LjL> !applets is <reply> To add useful applets to your panel, right click on the panel and choose "Add applet"
[04:53] <ubotu> I'll remember that, LjL
[04:53] <dreamer> hmm, in KDE, how can I set prefered aplications? I still can't get thunderbird to open a new mail-window when clicking on an emailadress
[04:53] <nothlit> I doubt it
[04:53] <nothlit> dreamer, launch kcontrol, it should be in there somewhere
[04:54] <nothlit> dreamer, otherwise you may be able to set it within your browser
[04:54] <ThePub> now that java is entirely gpl'd, has there been a word from ubuntu about inclusion of it into the main package database?

[05:12] <Danb99> Hey, I've installed the Aegis Anti-virus scanner through the "add applications" function. For some reason, its shortcut won't appear under "accessability" but I can run it through the terminal. I'm setting this PC up for someone new to PC's so I ideally need the shortcut, where can I find it?
[05:12] <jrib> evan_: ok uninstall the vlc plugin
[05:12] <nothlit> littlesniper, after installing ubuntu? or while trying to install ubuntu?
[05:12] <zyth> Danb99, have you logged out of gnome and back in? Sometimes you have to do so for the menus to refresh (there may be another way as well, I'm unsure)
[05:13] <Danb99> Thank you, i will try that
[05:13] <zyth> np
[05:13] <littlesniper> nothlit: when trying to install it
[05:13] <nothlit> zyth, the other way is killall gnome-panel
[05:13] <zyth> ahh
[05:13] <zyth> there
[05:13] <ismail> where can i get the gnome blutooth control remoto
[05:13] <zyth> thanks nothlit
[05:13] <ThunderM> Does anyone have an ideea about the plf repository for edgy ? When i've done a apt-get update today i woke up it couldn't reach them...
[05:13] <Danb99> I have actually reset but it still didn't appear. Any other ideas?
[05:13] <littlesniper> nothlit: boot fine, arrive to gnome, then back to login after a few secs. Worked fine on a newer comp though
[05:13] <evan_> jrib, ok
[05:14] <zyth> Danb99, manually add it.  System -> Preferences -> Menu Layout
[05:14] <Danb99> Thanks mate I will try that
[05:14] <JackW90> hi all
[05:14] <littlesniper> nothlit: when trying to click the install icon (when i have time :) ) the screen flashes and then... back to login

[05:14] <shinda> ritchiefrich: doesn't show a url just authors email @debian, but there is this url which seems to have info on it http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FAQ
[05:15] <nothlit> littlesniper, well I'm not exactly sure what you can do to fix that, but you can always use the alternate disc to install if the live cd doesn't work
[05:15] <richiefrich> shinda: thats what im reading now
[05:15] <nothlit> !alternate | littlesniper
[05:15] <littlesniper> nothlit: Can i switch to some text mode ?
[05:15] <ubotu> littlesniper: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[05:15] <JackW90> danb99 hi dude
[05:15] <Linuturk> how do you list out the installed packages using aptitude?
[05:15] <nothlit> Linuturk, aptitude search ~i
[05:15] <Linuturk> via the terminal, not the aptitude men
[05:16] <jrib> Linuturk: http://people.debian.org/~dburrows/aptitude-doc/en/

[05:16] <nothlit> jrib, how do you get a man url so fast?
[05:16] <richiefrich> shinda: what error do you get on trying to mount it9$
[05:16] <Linuturk> thanks
[05:16] <richiefrich> it?
[05:16] <Danb99> zyth there isn't a "menu layout" but there is a "menu & toolbars" but there isn't anything in there which will add the shortcut. any other ideas?
[05:16] <Danb99> hey jackw90
[05:16] <jrib> nothlit: bookmark
[05:16] <nothlit> littlesniper, theres probably a solution, and i'm thinking about it, but the alternate cd is a great tool, gives you more options as well
[05:17] <nothlit> Danb99, just rightclick on the applications bar and click edit menu
[05:17] <nothlit> Danb99, after that you can add it manually inside a category
[05:17] <JackW90> danb99 l8r m8!
[05:17] <Danb99> I've tried that and the virus scanner is there with a tick-box next to it but it still won't appear
[05:18] <nothlit> Danb99, tick the tick box ?
[05:18] <ismail> where can i get the gnome blutooth control remoto

[06:12] <eisenpm> hello, just one short question: USB-headsets work out of the box with edgy, right? no drivers needed?
[06:12] <age6racer> Sorry Breezy
[06:12] <kkaisare> Anyone here tried out the Herd-1 release?
[06:13] <clearscreen> age6racer I believe linksys WPC54G has a broadcom chipset.. which can now run native drivers instead of using ndiswrapper
[06:14] <jengc0il> !how to mount my xternal HDD to read write
[06:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about how to mount my xternal HDD to read write - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:14] <jengc0il> !mount external HDD
[06:14] <ubotu> mount: Tools for mounting and manipulating filesystems. In component main, is required. Version 2.12r-11ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 179 kB, installed size 400 kB
[06:14] <age6racer> that sounds good. Do I need to upgrade to edgy for that then?
[06:14] <clearscreen> well first try lspci and see what it spits back on your network controller
[06:15] <jengc0il> any1 any idea
[06:15] <age6racer> ok
[06:16] <clearscreen> linksys WPC54G (ver.1.2) is supported, just depends on what ver you're using
[06:16] <age6racer> clearscreen: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/GLG8VW86.html
[06:16] <emilia> right now im using vnc, but it doesnt help if someone is using it, or if its not logged in
[06:16] <emilia> does anyone know a way i can remotely log into my ubuntu pc from windows, with a new session?
[06:17] <clearscreen> ok, that's supported by the bcm43xx package
[06:17] <zaferbatur> if i dont spell wrong you have to enble xdmcp service
[06:18] <age6racer> bcm43xx? Do i need to install that in ndiswrapper?
[06:18] <clearscreen> what kernel are you using age6racer?
[06:18] <clearscreen> nope; ndiswrapper 'emulates' windows drivers. you're gonna want to install the native drivers
[06:18] <age6racer> How do I check that?
[06:18] <clearscreen> uname -a
[06:18] <age6racer> ok thanks
[06:19] <clearscreen> you'll need 2.6.15 or newer for these drivers
[06:19] <age6racer> 2.6.12-10-386
[06:19] <age6racer> so upgrade time then...
[06:19] <jengc0il> clearscreen: how to mount xternl HDD read write
[06:19] <clearscreen> indeed
[06:19] <clearscreen> no idea jengc0il, sorry
[06:20] <littlesniper> hey, i have another question guys: in the installation with the alternate CD I cant choose the packets right ?
[06:20] <jengc0il> clearscreen: but it auto detact
[06:20] <age6racer> thats fine, but i could do with soe help with a that in Xfce (I'm new to it and have only ever done upgrades with a gui in gnome)
[06:20] <jengc0il> clearscreen: but it readly only
[06:20] <nothlit> littlesniper, packages?
[06:20] <jengc0il> nothlit: hi there
[06:20] <littlesniper> ups yes
[06:20] <nothlit> littlesniper, you could install the minimal, and then install packages from the cd inside the installed system
[06:21] <clearscreen> age6racer once you have a newer kernel; apt-get install wireless-tools wpasupplicant.. then get bcm43xx-fwcutter tool (don't know if ubuntu breezy aptitude repositories have it)

[06:21] <jengc0il> nothlit: how to read write my xternal HDD/ pendrive
[06:21] <gnu> hi anybody knows how to install cs: source with cedega?
[06:21] <littlesniper> nothlit: hmmm not that cool, I guess I will have to uninstall a lot of things once they have been installed
[06:21] <nothlit> jengc0il, what filesystem is it?
[06:21] <clearscreen> ah age6racer, found the official ubuntu howto for those drivers. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Breezy#head-7a790bf9da8da9656c6f938a7382ac166c43a723
[06:22] <age6racer> thanks clearscreen
[06:22] <jengc0il> nothlit: all file in my xternal HDD
[06:22] <clearscreen> you're welcome
[06:22] <gnu> anybody knows how to install cs: source with cedega?
[06:22] <nothlit> jengc0il, as in, FAT, ext3, reiser?
[06:22] <jengc0il> nothlit: it autodetact but red only
[06:22] <littlesniper> nothlit: I was told that you could check or uncheck the package in this distribution ???? Im very surprised
[06:22] <nothlit> jengc0il, ok give me the line in mount -l
[06:22] <jengc0il> nothlit: hmm NTFS/fat32
[06:22] <jengc0il> w8
[06:22] <valme> luna
[06:23] <nothlit> littlesniper, nah its mostly to give people a default desktop, or you start with the base and build up
[06:23] <valme> hola
[06:23] <nothlit> littlesniper, otherwise you could use the net install or mini iso
[06:23] <nothlit> littlesniper, but the mini iso is very very hard to find
[06:23] <fbc> Is there a kernel fo AMD sempron 3000+ or should I just run i386?
[06:24] <fenrig> do i386
[06:24] <littlesniper> nothlit: well this sounds me like "create a script to uninstall all useless stuffs from all your computers :)"
[06:24] <fbc> fenrig:  thanks
[06:24] <magic_ninja> with java in ubuntu whats the best way to remove it
[06:24] <gnu> anybody knows how to install cs: source with cedega?
[06:24] <fenrig> i have a amd 64 3800+ and it runs smooth
[06:24] <nothlit> littlesniper, well otherwise people can customise the install cd
[06:24] <nothlit> littlesniper, like i said, you can use the mini iso, it does exactly what you want
[06:25] <fbc> fenrig: but you should be running the amd64 kernel not the i386
[06:25] <nothlit> magic_ninja, uninstall it with your package manager and remove any references you may have manually added
[06:25] <littlesniper> nothlit: will the alternative installation, ask me for a 64/32 bits kernel to install if my CPU is 64bits ?
[06:25] <nothlit> there is nothing wrong with running in 32 bit mode, 64bit linux does introduce some hassles
[06:25] <nothlit> littlesniper, no thats a different disc
[06:26] <nothlit> littlesniper, theres different discs for different cpus
[06:26] <kane77> can I install programs running only live cd?
[06:26] <littlesniper> nothlit: fine thank you
[06:26] <jengc0il> nothlit: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37021/
[06:26] <binit> are there any java development environment packages for linux
[06:26] <jengc0il> nothlit: do u got it?
[06:27] <binit> also, where are the mplayer packages?
[06:27] <littlesniper> synaptic removes the dependencies now or do we still have to use aptitude ?
[06:27] <fbc> nothlit: like what? because I've been dieing for better performance adn had dreams of switching to an amd64 machine running the ubuntu amd64 kernel.. Are you telling me it's not worth it?
[06:27] <nothlit> !ntfs-3g | jengc0il
[06:27] <ubotu> jengc0il: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[06:27] <nothlit> fbc, things like binary blobs, flash, some people have had problems, one person couldn't get freenx working
[06:28] <clearscreen> there's already a driver that supports ntfs write access? wow didn't know.
[06:28] <gnu> anybody knows how to install cs: source with cedega?
[06:28] <gnu> anybody knows how to install cs: source with cedega?
[06:28] <nothlit> clearscreen, theres been captiventfs for a while now
[06:28] <clearscreen> gnu #cedega
[06:28] <clearscreen> nothlit but didn
[06:28] <gnu> ok
[06:28] <jengc0il> nothlit: still beta
[06:28] <jengc0il> nothlit: how to solve my problem
[06:29] <clearscreen> didn't it require specially made partitions* I can remember it being possible but requiring a workaround*
[06:29] <nothlit> jengc0il, you want write access, install ntfs-3g
[06:29] <ValMarko> please somebody help. I dont have all the permission to move a file to a directory. How do I do it?
[06:29] <Igor_V2> i knoew it's not the ritgh place to ask....but anybody knows how i find my pendrive in Debian?
[06:29] <jengc0il> c lunapark?
[06:29] <nothlit> jengc0il, its plenty safe
[06:29] <fbc> nothlit: right now picasa keeps my cpu pinned at 100%. I thought I might need to upgrade my cpu.. but I guess picasa is just a hog...
[06:29] <nothlit> clearscreen, no
[06:29] <nothlit> fbc, use fspot then?
[06:29] <sharperguy> It it for real that ctrl+alt+delete shuts your computer down?
[06:29] <nothlit> fbc, is it still searching/indexing/thumbnailing?
[06:30] <nothlit> sharperguy, not unless you're in console view
[06:30] <Igor_V2> i know it's not the ritgh place to ask....but anybody knows how i find my pendrive in Debian?
[06:30] <lovloss> i love you guys :D
[06:30] <lovloss> Hey, whats the keyboard shortcut for closing an unresponsive program?
[06:30] <QwertyM> sharperguy, and yeah, it dont shut down, it reboots
[06:30] <TheGateKeeper> ValMarko: use sudo
[06:30] <nothlit> Igor_V2, its most likely in /dev/sda, you may need to automount it and #debian
[06:30] <QwertyM> lovloss, alt+f4 ?
[06:30] <lovloss> yay thanks :D
[06:30] <Igor_V2> ok...thanks
[06:30] <nothlit> lovloss, you can run xkill
[06:30] <ValMarko> I typed: sudo -i and password
[06:30] <lovloss> So anyway how is everyone
[06:30] <jengc0il> nothlit: thanks guy
[06:31] <ValMarko> But I still cant move the file
[06:31] <AlexC_> How can I create a link from /home/alex called music to /media/windows/music ?

[06:32] <nojoes> When i insert my network cable i don't get an IP until I do '/etc/init.d/networking restart'. How can I change this?
[06:32] <lovloss> Im mostly here to see if i can answer questions, since im always asking. I try so many things, lol. Beryl one day. C++ the next. Rendering. New motherboard.
[06:32] <Mastastealth> nojoes: do you have network manager installed?
[06:33] <jb0nd38372> lovloss: Hehe same here I experiment so much, its not even funny, an IT manager would look at my style of computing and probally stroke out
[06:33] <nojoes> Mastastealth: This is a fresh install. Is it standard?
[06:34] <phiwum> Hey ho.  How do I see a log of recently applied upgrades?
[06:34] <h0ndaracer2> hello everyone
[06:34] <Mastastealth> nojoes: No I don't think so...just apt-get install network-manager-gnome, great network app that should autodetect wireless or wired connections
[06:34] <lovloss> jb0nd38372: I live by the philosophy that making mistakes is better for learning than research =) Ive reinstalled ubuntu 4 times. I leave my system files on a seperate partition specifically for those mess-ups
[06:34] <nothlit> does apt-get have a log?
[06:34] <nojoes> Mastastealth: Ok, thanks alot!
[06:34] <phiwum> nothlit: I should hope so!  But maybe not.
[06:35] <lovloss> Once i just downloaded every package i could, and then all the suggested packages, and then THEIR suggested packages, until dvds failed to work o.O
[06:35] <phiwum> nothlit: Surely Ubuntu keeps a record of when an upgrade was applied?
[06:35] <magic_ninja> is there a package name for java
[06:35] <nothlit> there should be a sudo log
[06:35] <lovloss> magic_ninja: To program in?
[06:35] <ValMarko> How can I run as Administor on gnome?
[06:35] <nothlit> i would only look at the aptitude logs myself tho
[06:36] <nothlit> !sudo | ValMarko
[06:36] <ubotu> ValMarko: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:36] <jb0nd38372> lovloss: Ditto... right now i'm running beryl, with kiba dock, running world of warcraft under wine emulation , my windows friends come over and trip out when I cube the desktop and start rotating it... esp when world of warcraft is on one of the sides full screen
[06:36] <lovloss> ValMarko : gksudo nautilus
[06:36] <lovloss> :)
[06:36] <lovloss> but BE CAREFUL
[06:36] <Mastastealth> !java | magic_ninja
[06:36] <ubotu> magic_ninja: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[06:36] <phiwum> nothlit: What aptitude logs?  I'm new to ubuntu.
[06:36] <ValMarko> tanks lovloss
[06:36] <nothlit> phiwum, nm, alternate program
[06:36] <AlexC_> How can I get Surround sound ( 5.1 ) with Ubuntu?
[06:36] <phiwum> I guess that ls -lrt /var/cache/apt/archives works a bit.
[06:36] <nothlit> !aptitude | phiwum
[06:36] <ubotu> phiwum: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[06:36] <ValMarko> tanks everybody
[06:36] <lovloss> jb0nd38372: lol :D Thats awesome. i need to figure out Wine
[06:36] <Blippe> !java
[06:36] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[06:36] <lovloss> ValMarko: they are mad at me because gksudo is risky
[06:37] <magic_ninja> Mastastealth: thans
[06:37] <lovloss> ValMarko: you can delete any file, even system files
[06:37] <nothlit> lovloss, gksu(do) is no riskier than sudo
[06:37] <ValMarko> :) I just want to move a file to a directory just created :)
[06:37] <ValMarko> Tanks anyway :)
[06:38] <lovloss> nothlit: Except your in a GUI and not a command line. clicks and keyboard are different
[06:38] <lasse> quit
[06:38] <lovloss> ValMarko: it works for me, i use it ALL the time. Just be safe :D
[06:38] <lasse> oops
[06:38] <nothlit> a user could just as easily do rm -r wildcard character
[06:38] <jb0nd38372> lovloss: me too , the current version of wine .0.9.2 I think actually runs wow, without any other configuration other than running wine wow.exe -opengl.  Back a couple wine builds ago, lotsa editing was required, maybe they can implement .net structures someday soon
[06:38] <daviey> Hi, how can i easily convert avi to mpeg?

[06:39] <lovloss> jb0nd38372: Whenever i install anything in Wine, the program wont start. Says that the file is a bad exe.
[06:39] <daviey> nothlit, *easily*
[06:39] <nothlit> daviey, install vlc, it can transcode things
[06:39] <daviey> cheersd
[06:39] <nothlit> I think vlc as a whole actually has more features than mplayer
[06:39] <lovloss> gksudo is the worst thing ever for changing permissions though. It always messes up :<
[06:40] <nothlit> lovloss, again, it would be gksudo filemanager?
[06:40] <lovloss> nothlit: ya
[06:40] <nothlit> lovloss, and i've never had that problem
[06:41] <jb0nd38372> lovloss: Ehh, I've not had that issue as of yet... I did most of my installs in ubuntu with automatix, and with wine, just ran ./winecfg after it installed and setup wine with basic options... , did a mime type to tell wine to7 handle *.exe's when clicked in natulas, and most things try and run that way for me, otherwise I jump to howto's.
[06:42] <lovloss> jb0nd38372: hmm... i hope i get it configured right someday
[06:42] <jb0nd38372> lovloss: you will.. :) got faith!
[06:43] <brohken> hey
[06:43] <brohken> can someone give me a recommendation and some info?
[06:44] <nothlit> !automatix | jb0nd38372
[06:44] <ubotu> jb0nd38372: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[06:44] <nothlit> !ask | brohken
[06:44] <ubotu> brohken: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:44] <glenn> new to Ubuntu ! hello
[06:44] <brohken> im looking to install ubuntu. I need a recommendation on which kind of laptop to get. i'd like to run Beryl XGL with ubuntu
[06:45] <brohken> and I also want something that will easily work with Ubuntu/Beryl... a Dell maybe?
[06:45] <lovloss> okay let me show you guys what im doing. I installed Gabriel Knight 3, which wineapps says works fine
[06:45] <nothlit> !hi | glenn
[06:45] <ubotu> glenn: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:45] <sc4ttrbrain> brohken,if ur looking a bit old laptop, try HP nx9100 ,mine is, all works by default, even the so called special button etc
[06:45] <glenn> I'll just listen in
[06:45] <nothlit> brohken, you probably want aiglx, the best bet is something with an intel card, otherwise run nvidia.
[06:45] <lovloss> wine: could not load L"C:\\Sierra\\Gabriel Knight 3\\GK3.exe": Bad EXE format for
[06:45] <nothlit> brohken, don't get an ati
[06:46] <lovloss> and thats all. 'for'...
[06:46] <lovloss> above that it says err:module:map_image Could not map section .rsrc, file probably truncated
[06:46] <littlesniper> nothlit: ubuntu is installed now. i have the same issue as  during the installation fo the desktop CD: gnome starts then fall back to the login gdm screen
[06:46] <lovloss> i get this message when i try to run *any* program i installed in wine, though they install just fine. anyone know what may be my issue?
[06:47] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: have u run winecfg?
[06:47] <brohken> nothlit: I saw a really nice guide for how to get beryl working with ubuntu on a pc with a ati card
[06:47] <fbc> nothlit: does matter that the pictures that picasa is working with and thumnailing are 12 megapixel photos??
[06:47] <brohken> why stay away from ati?
[06:47] <nothlit> littlesniper, ok you'll need to press ctrl + alt+ f1, and login, then type less /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[06:47] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: yes but i didnt see any changes to make, and my 'sound' tab crashes th cfg
[06:47] <nothlit> littlesniper, and look at the errors
[06:47] <swiftfeet8> After installing updates my sound card is no longer detected.  Any suggestions?
[06:47] <nothlit> fbc, lol definitely
[06:47] <littlesniper> nothlit: im on
[06:47] <nothlit> fbc, its probably not near finished yet
[06:48] <fbc> nothlit:  Crap... you get agood camera and it screws up your computer..
[06:48] <nothlit> brohken, ati support is not the best in linux, unless you go with old cards supported by the radeon driver instead of the fglrx drivers
[06:48] <nothlit> brohken, you can get ati, but i can't promise it won't be a HUGE hassle
[06:49] <brohken> hrmmm
[06:49] <sc4ttrbrain> ati radeon 9000 works great here
[06:49] <swiftfeet8> I have a list of the updates that were done.  The kernel headers were updated, which I am guessing has something to do with it?
[06:49] <brohken> how about the x series laptop radeons?
[06:49] <nothlit> littlesniper, after you type that, you have to hit enter and scroll until you see errors
[06:49] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: Do i need to add one of these quadrilion libraries?
[06:49] <nothlit> swiftfeet8, kernel headers have nothing to do with your sound not working
[06:49] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: what libs?
[06:50] <nothlit> brohken, the radeon driver does not correlate to the radeons, its just the name of the opensource driver
[06:50] <littlesniper> nothlit: :) im an old linux user, though not ubuntu. I got that :-P
[06:50] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: under the 'libraries' tab of winecfg.
[06:50] <swiftfeet8> I didn't think so, but the only other things that were updated were libavahi
[06:50] <nothlit> littlesniper, ok then you can find the errors, or use w3m and then paste them in the pastebin
[06:50] <nothlit> !pastebin | littlesniper
[06:50] <ubotu> littlesniper: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:51] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: if it need it,yes...
[06:51] <littlesniper> nothlit: i know that too :) though I dont know how i can do as X doesnt stay up as I told you
[06:51] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: The wineapp page didnt mention any libraries, it just said it runs fine :( but i get the error message when i run it
[06:51] <fbc> nothlit:  What's weird is that picasa uses something called explorer.exe that's using up my cock cycles over 75%. I gave it a nice value of 19 so that it doesn't consume all my cpu clock cycles.
[06:52] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: get any error?
[06:52] <nothlit> littlesniper, it sounds like x stays up from what you said, its just gnome initialisation fails and you get kicked back to gdm

[06:53] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: yes, they said it works fine
[06:53] <nothlit> fbc, hahaha
[06:53] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: it installed perfectly - although, it didnt go to the directx installer afterwards.
[06:54] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: it use opengl?

[06:56] <eilker> hi , i am installing ubuntu-server at the moment, there are options, install to hard disk, install lamp server, what to choose ?
[06:56] <daxxar> nothlit, that was fo rme?
[06:56] <nothlit> littlesniper, how did you set up your voodoo card before?
[06:56] <nothlit> eilker, it depends on what sort of server you want

[06:57] <bXi> does one of you know any sound edit/recording tools cept for audacity
[06:57] <littlesniper> nothlit: yes zenwalk doesnt use gnome...

[06:58] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: got the same version?
[06:58] <nothlit> littlesniper, so is it popping back to gdm or is x restarting?
[06:58] <eilker> nothlit: i know that guide, but if i choosed install lamp server , would it use cd as a repo ?
[06:58] <Roscar> I'm hoping for help installing the propriatary drivers for my ati video card. I'm running Dapper and have an ATI Radeon 9200 SE
[06:59] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: i have the version that ubuntu loads as a package, and it hasnt given me an update :/
[06:59] <nothlit> eilker, it can
[06:59] <Roscar> I've downloaded the driver from ATI's site but I'm unsure where to go from there.
[06:59] <nothlit> eilker, i think
[06:59] <nothlit> eilker, if you need to get rid of the cdrom, you can comment it out it /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:59] <Crazyl1nk> im in need of some help
[06:59] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: no imean the software version

[06:59] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: Gabriel knight? yes, same version
[06:59] <eilker> nothlit: so what happens, if i boot from cd and choose install lamp server, after installation
[07:00] <nothlit> littlesniper, if you don't see any console/black/white/text/foreground/black/white/flickering/blinking, x didn't restart
[07:00] <littlesniper> nothlit: i have also a complain about aiglx saying that the 3D driver claims not to support visual xxxx
[07:00] <tristam_> /* off topic: What does SOL stand for? As in this service is SOL */
[07:00] <nothlit> eilker, oh you can't do that, it'll start the installation from scratch
[07:00] <lovloss> tristam_: sh** out of luck
[07:00] <nothlit> littlesniper, um... thats really odd... aiglx is for composite window managers.. but you don't even have one installed
[07:01] <eilker> nothlit: and without lamp server, what is the use of ubuntu server ?
[07:01] <nothlit> littlesniper, what version # are you installing?

[07:01] <Crazyl1nk> im trying to add a user over my terminal commands using the Useradd command but i get a reply saying "useradd: unable to lock password file" how can i fix this?
[07:01] <nothlit> eilker, you can build it from scratch... a non -x installation, you can run samba, nfs, lots of things
[07:01] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: how did the installation?have u install things that needed by the software?
[07:01] <lovloss> tristam_: ;)
[07:01] <lovloss> sc4ttrbrain: I believe so. It says directx is up to date
[07:01] <sc4ttrbrain> lovloss: directx 9?
[07:02] <lovloss> the one that came with GK3
[07:02] <littlesniper> actually I have black flickering in the short time I have gnome, before falling back to gdm. I dont know if this is a X restarting sign
[07:02] <eilker> nothlit: i am gonna format and choose lamp server installation...
[07:02] <lovloss> which is like 6.
[07:02] <pike_> DaDiablo: im assuming thats mplayer ? what are you wanting to do?
[07:02] <nothlit> littlesniper, #xorg might be able to help you
[07:02] <cpic> Hi, I need some help please. I'm trying to configure spamassassin with amavis-new in dapper, but it just doesn't work, amavis-new works ok with clam-av but spamassassin. Has someone succeded configuring this in dapper?
[07:02] <nothlit> littlesniper, you can restart x with ctrl+alt+backspace and see if theres any difference
[07:03] <littlesniper> nothlit: :/ are you sure its their issue ? i mean the same computer works for other linux distribution which are shipped with xorg as well
[07:03] <Cisco> hi evrebody
[07:03] <nothlit> littlesniper, its not but they might be able to help you, otherwise you can stick around here and keep asking or ask on ubuntuforums.org

[07:05] <Cisco> So
[07:05] <eilker> nothlit: can we say that the difference between ubuntu and ubuntu-server is only X ?
[07:05] <pike_> eilker: and other bloat
[07:06] <nothlit> eilker, no, it lacks all the desktop packages, and suites
[07:06] <eilker> pike_:bloat ?
[07:06] <magic_ninja> does anyone have the java6 runtime (their download site is down) or know a link to another site that hosts them
[07:06] <sc4ttrbrain> eilker: the server kernel is different i think
[07:06] <Cisco> i have some problems with login manager: gdm doesent start and the icon of log out doesn't show me icon to rebbot or shoutdown pc
[07:07] <pike_> eilker: i was refering to the suites and other software you might not use but is installed
[07:07] <Mastastealth> Cisco: are you using XGL?

[07:07] <finalbeta> Anyone using Nicotine as soulseek client? i'm guessing the version in edgy is already to old to stay connected to the network.
[07:08] <finalbeta> That's really a problem with things like that and wine, they are outdated the moment they are put in the repo.
[07:08] <Cisco> but i dont think is aiglx problem
[07:08] <Cisco> if i write on shell dpkg-reconfigure gdm

[07:09] <Cisco> i try to remove and install again by synaptic gdm, but it's the same
[07:10] <sc4ttrbrain> nothlit: doesnt it come with kernel automized for server?
[07:10] <Mastastealth> Cisco: Ok, I was asking about XGL cuz that happened when I had it instsalled (the logout buttons missing), but aiglx hasnt messed with that. if you do a "/etc/init.d/gdm restart" when you are in the console mode (ctrl-alt-f1), what happens?
[07:11] <nothlit> sc4ttrbrain, ehm I don't think so, could be wrong
[07:11] <Cisco> now i try

But the moment i mention my powerpc not sleeping. The room goes silent. (well as silent as it can get) I mean, ubuntu not being able to support hibernate, and suspend is a huge issue.
[07:15] <nothlit> eilker, if you install svgalib, you'll need to configure it, just like the xorg config, but manually
[07:15] <ClydeGoffe> I realize that i need to somehow diactivate that volume group to make it unbusy
[07:15] <ClydeGoffe> but not sure how
[07:15] <nothlit> NoonInSF, not so much, windows doesn't have it really working, and you can still shutdown/startup

[07:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gtfp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:25] <eilker> nothlit: sorry for my newbie questions, but what i want to is to reach internet graphically in console, i read fb but didnt get the point...
[07:25] <mzanfardino> nothlit: I installed ftpd first, wasn't able to connect, then read that I shouldbe using wu-ftpd.
[07:25] <nothlit> mzanfardino, you can also use sftp
[07:25] <pike_> mzanfardino: an alternative is to use scp sftp.  there is a gui windows client called winscp. all you have to do at the server is apt-get install openssh-server
[07:25] <bigbro> mzanfardino: It's Secure CoPy. Use it instead of FTP.
[07:25] <nothlit> eilker, you need to edit your grub.conf to include a vga code
[07:25] <mzanfardino> pike_: will that permit remote access to my machine?
[07:25] <nothlit> !gftp | mzanfardino
[07:25] <ubotu> gftp: X/GTK+ FTP client. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0.18-14ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 44 kB, installed size 76 kB
[07:25] <bigbro> mzanfardino: Are they both Linux machines?
[07:25] <pike_> mzanfardino: yes
[07:25] <mzanfardino> yes
[07:25] <nothlit> eilker, then you will need to restart, and run links2 -g
[07:25] <Crazyl1nk> adduser -d /home/teamspeak teamspeak = Option d is ambiguous (debug, disabled-login, disabled-password) adduser: The user `/home/teamspeak' does not exist.
[07:25] <mzanfardino> ok, one sec
[07:26] <bigbro> mzanfardino: Use scp - it will already be installed and ready to run - no daemons to configure, nothing.
[07:26] <jengc0il> nothlit: http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[07:26] <bigbro> mzanfardino: It just works - and is secure.
[07:26] <pike_> mzanfardino: if your machine is exposed to the internet id uninstall the ftp server unless you are comfortable setting it up right
[07:26] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: that's not the correct syntax.  Just do   adduser teamspeak
[07:26] <bigbro> !scp | mzanfardino
[07:26] <ubotu> mzanfardino: SCP is a secure way of copying files across networks using !SSH. Usage: scp filename user@host:filename - WinSCP is a client for Windows, available at http://winscp.net/
[07:26] <nothlit> sftp is also already installed
[07:26] <jengc0il> nothlit: step apt-get update
[07:26] <nothlit> bigbro, you  haven't told him/her that he needs to install openssh-server first
[07:27] <padlefot> why does the ircd resolve my host as 'i=' ?
[07:27] <Crazyl1nk> only root may add user or group, do i run in root terminal?
[07:27] <Thuryn> no
[07:27] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: sudo adduser teamspeak
[07:27] <Crazyl1nk> (forgive me im learning as i go)
[07:27] <padlefot> same as the thilde on other networks? no working identd?
[07:27] <nothlit> jengc0il, you're running dapper?
[07:27] <jengc0il> nothlit: yup
[07:27] <jengc0il> LTS
[07:27] <jengc0il> nothlit: LTS 6.06
[07:27] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: why not use system > administration > users and groups ?
[07:28] <Crazyl1nk> because id like to run as this page tells me, i hate turning off from the commands they give me because then i dont know where i went wrong
[07:28] <nothlit> jengc0il, oh upgrade/dist-upgrade, if you don't modify sources.list in a specific way, will just basically keep your packages up to date, after you syncronise the lists with update
[07:28] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: what page?
[07:29] <Crazyl1nk> http://www.goteamspeak.com/index.php?page=tutorial_b
[07:29] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: ok did that adduser command work?
[07:29] <eilker> !repo
[07:29] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[07:29] <jengc0il> nothlit: oic. mean all that pckage had install will not missing
[07:30] <Crazyl1nk> it did let me finish up the questions its asking me
[07:30] <buscon> Hi, how can I make an ubuntu mirror from a debian machine?
[07:30] <Crazyl1nk> ok yes
[07:30] <Crazyl1nk> user is added
[07:31] <nothlit> buscon, just use a guide to set up a mirror but mirror an ubuntu repository instead
[07:32] <buscon> nothlit, that's what I did, but I get
[07:32] <buscon> Download of dists/edgy/Release failed: 404 Not Found Download of dists/edgy/Release.gpg failed: 404 Not Found Release signature does not verify.
[07:32] <eilker> how to find the repo for a package ? i am looing for links2 but i dont know at which repo it is...
[07:32] <eilker> *looking
[07:32] <nothlit> buscon, you needto get the gpg key
[07:32] <nothlit> !info links2
[07:32] <ubotu> links2: Web browser running in both graphics and text mode. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.1pre23-1 (edgy), package size 2009 kB, installed size 3224 kB
[07:32] <pike_> eilker: i do apt-cache madison packagename
[07:33] <pike_> eilker: er but that wont help you if repo isnt there  :)
[07:33] <mzanfardino> thank you.  SCP seems to do the trick.
[07:33] <eilker> pike_: madison ? :)
[07:33] <hjmills> eilker: if its in ubuntu just enable them all and install it or use apt-cache or if its not on the ubuntu repos search on apt.org (i think thats right) but they may not work
[07:33] <pike_> eilker: fyi it in universe
[07:34] <zylche> talking of crashes, ubuntu just did it on its very own..
[07:34] <jrib> ubotu: tell Crazyl1nk about sudo
[07:34] <nothlit> jrib, why you using tell?
[07:35] <l3mr> is there a way to upgrade from a running 32bit system to a 64bit ubuntu? ( i installed my old harddisk with i386 ubu in my new 64bit system ), or do i have to install the base system anew?
[07:35] <ollekalle> q: my nvida-driver seems to stop working after I installed gdm. (I managed to run while installing though). If I change driver to vesa in xorg.conf x starts but with nvidia I get a black screen. Any ideas?
[07:35] <ven0m> Guys, i am new to linux, and i got a problem with streaming videos, on YouTube for example - i hear no sound in NONE of them. what am i missing to fix that?
[07:35] <nothlit> !flash9
[07:35] <ubotu> flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[07:35] <mathiouzz> ollekalle take a look at /var/log/xorg.o.loh
[07:36] <mathiouzz> log*
[07:36] <ven0m> i installed flash 9 already
[07:36] <jrib> nothlit: why not?
[07:36] <mathiouzz> u'll probably find the reason why u've got a black screen
[07:36] <nothlit> jrib, so other users could potentially see it and learn something? dunno
[07:36] <eilker> pike_: thanx
[07:36] <ven0m> !backports
[07:36] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[07:37] <pike_> ven0m: see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297298 maybe
[07:37] <jrib> nothlit: I guess that's a godo point
[07:37] <defrex0> also make sure you have a plugin and not just the player
[07:37] <eilker> nothlit: is 3 gb enough for ubuntu server with lamp ?
[07:37] <nothlit> ollekalle, its /var/log/Xorg.0.log (the capitalised X is important)
[07:37] <mathiouzz> too late nothlit :P
[07:37] <mathiouzz> <mathiouzz> ollekalle take a look at /var/log/xorg.o.loh
[07:37] <mathiouzz> <mathiouzz> log*
[07:37] <nothlit> eilker, should be, depends on how large your /var/www will be
[07:38] <nothlit> mathiouzz, reread what  I said
[07:38] <lasse__> eilker  its probably enoguh
[07:38] <mathiouzz> erh oky :P
[07:38] <eilker> nothlit: got it, just practicing here :)
[07:38] <ollekalle> nothlit, mathiouzz: It keeps only the last session logged, right?
[07:38] <cbx33> is there a nice piece of ubuntu software to burn a slideshow for use o na dvd playert?

[07:39] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: from what youv told me and from this page im almost done, if you can do you mind helping me with the last few steps?
[07:39] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: just ask the channel, I'll help if I can
[07:39] <nothlit> ollekalle, more sessions will get logged as well... take a look in /var/log... if on the command line use ls /var/log
[07:39] <l3mr> is it possible to resize an ext3 partition without losing any data on that partition ( given that there is enough free space ) ?

[07:40] <ubox> hey all
[07:41] <Helpmeee> im having some trouble installing that
[07:41] <nothlit> Helpmeee, you'll need to tell us what you error messages are
[07:42] <ubox> anyone knows about -> fetchmail: socket error while fetching from ...
[07:42] <carlos42> my friend's aunt is having a disaster area with an old pc, i got sketchy information from him but sounds like virus infections and the thing is dying.  not sure of age of pc but he thinks it's running windows 95, possibly windows 98 so it's likely to be more than 6 years old, can't remember what specs were back then, probably pentium/p2 with 16-64MB ram.  i suggested Ubuntu if she doesn't want to replace the pc.  will Ubuntu work on such a lo
[07:42] <carlos42> spec PC?
[07:42] <pike_> carlos42: go with xubuntu ligher but still gui friendly
[07:42] <bigbro> carlos42: PRobably, yes. But your question is like asking how long a piece of string is.
[07:42] <Helpmeee> nothlit, Nvidia thing or  or xorg-dev
[07:42] <ollekalle> nothlit, mathiouzz: not much fishy in the log. There are a handful of "NVIDIA(0): WAIT...". Any clues or something I should look for?
[07:43] <bigbro> carlos42: It's a better (IMHO) alternative than any of the modern windows variants.
[07:43] <nothlit> Helpmeee, xorg-dev
[07:43] <nothlit> ollekalle, anything with ER or error
[07:43] <Helpmeee> Hmm.. now that I think of it, i dont think that i've tried to install that ...
[07:43] <ubox> anyone knows about -> fetchmail: socket error while fetching from ...
[07:43] <nothlit> carlos42, it won't work on something with such low ram
[07:43] <knoppix> knkn
[07:43] <nothlit> carlos42, theres a very slight chance xubuntu may run, but I doubt it
[07:43] <togawoga> hiya - trying to install ubuntu
[07:44] <carlos42> (g) :-) yes, i know... "work" is a relative term.... all she needs is to do web surfing and edit word documents I think.  Is there some way of just saying to ubuntu when it starts "only install the bare minimum"?
[07:44] <Crazyl1nk> the page askes me to run a command "tar -xjf ts2_server_rc2_20201.tar.bz2" but it doesnt work.
[07:44] <Helpmeee> nothlit, could you write the commandline here on how to isntall it? Wanna get things right ;p
[07:44] <togawoga> i'm getting very confused...I boot up with the cd, and i just get a brown screen
[07:44] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: pastebin the output
[07:44] <nothlit> carlos42, not unless you want to start without graphics and do things from the command line
[07:44] <jrib> !pastebin | Crazyl1nk
[07:44] <ubotu> Crazyl1nk: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:44] <togawoga> i can do ctrl-alt-F1 and get a prompt, but no commands do anything other than just sit there
[07:44] <nothlit> Helpmeee, sudo aptitude install xorg-dev
[07:45] <nothlit> togawoga, did you log in?
[07:45] <ubox> anyone for fetchmail error?
[07:45] <togawoga> no i didn't log in
[07:45] <ollekalle> nothlit: not a single er or error (lots of vERsion though :/ ). I appreciate any suggestions...
[07:45] <Helpmeee> nothlit, thanks, gonna try it right away :)
[07:45] <mailer> now where did i lose the dvd disc image I copied into edgy while trying to write multiple copies?
[07:45] <carlos42> nothlit: i'd have no problem doing that myself, i'm an old hand with various linux distros but i was going to post my friend a CD and get him to do it... if it looks at all hard he'll give up and go out and spend 400 on a low spec box to run XP Home (yuk!!)
[07:46] <togawoga> i put the cd in and hit the 'run or install ubuntu' option
[07:46] <nothlit> bah my factoids are all rejected
[07:46] <togawoga> i can't even run 'ls' the prompt just hangs
[07:46] <nothlit> carlos42, DSL? you could give him xubuntu and hope it works
[07:46] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: i dont understand what you mean
[07:47] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: copy the command you entered, as well as the output.  Then go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and paste it in the form there.  Submit it.  Then give us the url
[07:47] <togawoga> somehow i'm booting up, but the installer isn't starting
[07:47] <zylche> -_-
[07:47] <togawoga> is the installer supposed to start when you boot off of the cd?
[07:47] <nothlit> !alternate | togawoga
[07:47] <ubotu> togawoga: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[07:48] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: there was no output that the problem ._.
[07:48] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: paste the command then
[07:48] <togawoga> yes i get that its a live cd, but how do i get from the live part to starting the installation?
[07:48] <s0nix> hi
[07:48] <togawoga> i just get a blank screen with a mouse cursor

[07:49] <mailer> donvella, ls /boot
[07:49] <carlos42> nothlit: :-) she doesn't even have broadband i think - he was reporting download speeds of 3k per second, which sounds like dialup to me... he's non technical... I think he's already given up on linux as he thinks it sounds hard, shame to fork out 400 though and end up with windows XP which will go out of support in a few years, is inferior and virus prone when she could end up with a beautiful new experience, mind you I'm not trekking 30 m
[07:49] <carlos42> out to Maidenhead to install it for her
[07:49] <nothlit> donvella, cd /boot
[07:49] <togawoga> nothlit are you trying to tell me i should be using the alternate cd?
[07:50] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: you can do most of that stuff with the gui.  The wget command just downloads a file.  The tar -xjf thing just extracts it
[07:50] <donvella> cheers
[07:50] <nothlit> carlos42, how do you expect him to run xp on 64mb ram?
[07:50] <Crazyl1nk> i know
[07:50] <nothlit> togawoga, its easier than fixing X on the livecd
[07:50] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: what is GUI?
[07:50] <togawoga> ok thanks
[07:50] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: graphical user interface
[07:50] <nothlit> GUI = graphical user interface
[07:50] <togawoga> hopei have another blank cd around :(
[07:50] <Crazyl1nk> well dont i feel dumb.
[07:51] <carlos42> nothlit - sorry not to be clear.... i said his options are (1) upgrade to linux or (2) throw the pc away and buy a new one with XP on it for about 400
[07:51] <carlos42> option (3), trying to make windows 98 or 95 work and be safe is just not worth it
[07:52] <Helpmeee> nothlit, is it "aptidue"
[07:52] <nothlit> !aptitude | Helpmeee
[07:52] <ubotu> Helpmeee: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[07:52] <eilker> nothlit: i am in partioaning screen, 1/erase the disk 2/ erase the disk and use lvm , what to choose
[07:52] <eilker> !lvm
[07:52] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[07:53] <nothlit> eilker, depends on what you want to use.. lvm is advanced, but lets you do things like resize on the fly, span across multiple partitions, snapshots and so on
[07:53] <nothlit> eilker, do you want to wipe the whole disk?
[07:53] <mrabbit> hey, torrents on ubuntu download slowly whilst the upload speed is normal, my router is fine as the speeds are ok on windows and were on suse 10.1 which i stopped using
[07:53] <nothlit> eilker, lvm takes more work, i would recommend using ext3
[07:53] <eilker> nothlit: working with vmware server
[07:54] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: i switched to the teamspeak profile from my terminal, im punching the commands from the terminal. is there a easier way to do the remaining steps?
[07:54] <nothlit> eilker, just choose 1
[07:54] <seppe> hi, does anyone has a solution to the poor ntfs-3g performance when writing large files (a 4 GB file takes 3 hours to copy!)
[07:54] <eilker> nothlit: sorry u recommend without lvm ?
[07:54] <nothlit> seppe, don't use ntfs
[07:54] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: what step are you on?
[07:54] <mrabbit> can anybody plz help me sort out my slow torrents? i've tried azureus and ktorrent
[07:54] <seppe> easy said
[07:54] <XiXaQ> hmm. Dependency is not satisfiable: libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 <-- How can I fix that?
[07:54] <nothlit> eilker, yeah its advanced, there will be graphical tools for it in feisty probably, but now now
[07:54] <shwag> how do I troubleshoot a VHOST that is not being recognized?
[07:55] <seppe> it's a external hard drive I want to use in Windows machines and Linux machines without installing ext2 s

[07:55] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: the command right under the *Unpack the Linux server by using the following command*
[07:55] <nothlit> seppe, use FAT
[07:55] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: right click on the tar.bz2 you downloaded and extract it
[07:56] <mralphabet> seppe: are you sure it is usb 2.0?
[07:56] <seppe> the problem with FAT32 is that it can't handle files larger than 4 GB
[07:56] <seppe> yes, it's USB 2.0
[07:56] <mralphabet> those speeds seem right for usb 1.1
[07:56] <nothlit> you're using it for backup images?
[07:56] <seppe> yeah, kind of :)
[07:56] <mralphabet> but is it recognized as 2.0
[07:56] <seppe> DVD images
[07:56] <nothlit> you can always use the split command
[07:56] <seppe> dunno, how can I check?
[07:57] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: done
[07:57] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: now you can do the remaining steps in your terminal
[07:57] <seppe> *sigh* I guess I have to format it as ext2 and install that driver from fs-driver.org on all Windows machines I tough with this external hdd
[07:57] <nothlit> seppe, lshw

[08:02] <eilker> nothlit: ok thanx
[08:03] <nothlit> eilker, then restore the mbr with /dev/urandom  or null or an artbitrary file
[08:03] <nothlit> eilker, the howtos tell you how to restore, basically restore it with something else
[08:03] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: now that the hard part is out of the way, do you know of anything about Teamspeak?
[08:03] <jrib> Crazyl1nk: nope
[08:03] <eilker> nothlit: i have already read howto restore , but i dont know howto damage :)
[08:03] <Crazyl1nk> jrib: crap... time for trial and error.
[08:04] <nothlit> eilker, lol don't use the .img file to restore with
[08:04] <eilker> nothlit: in fact i damaged it many times without knowing it is my nightmare :D
[08:04] <nothlit> eilker, restore instead from /dev/urandom or /dev/null or /path/to/file.mp3
[08:05] <jokoon> can, someone, tell me, how, to return, in normal, fullscreen mode, on desktop ?
[08:05] <nothlit> so it would be if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda
[08:05] <nothlit> with a limiter of course
[08:05] <nothlit> make sure you use a limiter or it'll wipe the whole drive, and you wouldn't want that
[08:06] <morghot> hi all
[08:07] <eilker> nothlit: in fact i still didnt understand how to do it, i think i need to google...
[08:07] <jokoon> How to quit the zooming mode on ubuntu desktop ?
[08:07] <nothlit> eilker, do you understand how dd works?
[08:07] <nothlit> eilker, man dd
[08:07] <seppe> wasn't there a graphical format/create FS utility in Gnome present? If so, what is it called and where do I find it?
[08:08] <eilker> nothlit: i was already start to read it:)
[08:08] <nothlit> eilker, :D:D
[08:08] <l3mr> seppe: gparted?
[08:08] <nothlit> !gparted | seppe
[08:08] <ubotu> seppe: gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[08:08] <seppe> yeah, but I guess it isn't installed default
[08:08] <seppe> because I don't have it right now :)
[08:08] <l3mr> seppe: but you have apt-get
[08:08] <l3mr> :)
[08:08] <seppe> yeah, and a slow internet connection ;)
[08:08] <Eddie> i have a wireless card and the driver it loads i dont want so i have to rmmod the driver and modprobe the correct one everytime. Is there a way to set the driver to the one i wish so i dont have to do this everytime i reboot
[08:09] <seppe> ah its almost downloaded hehe
[08:09] <goochy> isn't there a VNC viewer built into ubuntu?
[08:09] <nothlit> yeah

[08:10] <nothlit> did you try reconfiguring xorg?
[08:10] <nothlit> Pf123b, this one
[08:10] <eilker> nothlit: is "dd mbr" very stupid approach ? so sorry
[08:11] <pike_> Eddie: you should be able to add a module to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist  and the one to load to /etc/modules
[08:11] <Pf123b> Well, I just apt-get installed' mysql-server, and yea, im trying to login, telling me wrong password, what would my password be?

[08:11] <burgermann> Hi. What's the reconfigure command for dpkg?
[08:11] <Eddie> thanks pike_ i will do that now :)
[08:11] <eilker> Pf123b: mysql -u root -p
[08:11] <nothlit> !lamp | Pf123b
[08:11] <ubotu> Pf123b: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[08:11] <nothlit> dpkg-reconfigure
[08:11] <burgermann> oh
[08:11] <burgermann> thx
[08:12] <Pf123b> thanks, ill take a look at that
[08:13] <chutzpah> nothlit: so i take it that there are no packages for it that don't depend on libx11?

[08:16] <finalbeta> magic_ninja, it's free to download from sun. Why do you need it?
[08:16] <nothlit> !java
[08:16] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:16] <finalbeta> nothlit, he specifically asked for 6

[08:17] <finalbeta> atleast not the ubuntu ones which are doomed to have old versions.

[08:19] <finalbeta> nothlit, pretty sure feisty wont have it for some time ever. I'm pretty disappointed with it anyway. better GTK support my "bum". The open File dialog looks like something a kid hacked up. And most special things are still not supported. And with that Netbeans 5.5 wrote 2 of my projects broken.
[08:19] <Zambezi> How is the support for Pioneer DVD+R Duallayer-writer in Linux?
[08:19] <diezare> Guys, I have ubuntu 6.10 and I want to install kernel 686 smp. But I can't find it in apt-cache search. Any Ideas?
[08:20] <l3mr> !generic
[08:20] <ubotu> Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html

[08:20] <pike_> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[08:20] <pike_> ach sorry
[08:20] <l3mr> diezare: so just use the -generic kernel instead.
[08:21] <magic_ninja> finalbeta: sun's download servers are down...and i can't find a mirror anywhere
[08:21] <diezare> l3mr, where can I get the -generic kernel?
[08:21] <magic_ninja> finalbeta: down for maintainence that is
[08:21] <l3mr> diezare: apt-get install linux-image-(something)-generic
[08:22] <diezare> l3mr, what's the diffrence between that and the normal kernel?
[08:22] <l3mr> diezare: ubuntu folks made some performance testing and noticed that there's almost no difference between the different sub archs (i686, i686smp and so on)
[08:22] <l3mr> diezare: therefore you just have this kernel
[08:23] <l3mr> !tell diezare about generic
[08:23] <crimsun_> -generic is tuned for 586 and smp, whereas -386 is tuned for 486 and up
[08:23] <l3mr> diezare: generic has smp enabled, btw
[08:24] <diezare> l3mr, my laptop is dual core 1.8 with 512MB RAM and build-in viga. every time I start up the system it starts very slowly and when I open the menu it takes noticable time to load the images. and ideas to improve the performance?
[08:25] <l3mr> diezare: buy more ram :)
[08:25] <l3mr> !performance
[08:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about performance - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:25] <diezare> l3mr, linux-686 - Obsoleted by: linux-generic is that the kernel ur telling me about?
[08:25] <l3mr> diezare: yes
[08:25] <diezare> l3mr, just get it and remove nothing?
[08:25] <eilker> nothlit: 'dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda'    is it ok ?
[08:25] <mailer> in edgy oo.o to evolution cut and paste is *sometimes* not working... looks like oo.o document font related ... reproduction of issue is erratic ... is this known?
[08:25] <mailer> #
[08:26] <l3mr> diezare: also, try disabling some effects
[08:26] <l3mr> diezare: well install the new kernel first, boot it, if everything works you can apt-get remove the old ones
[08:26] <diezare> l3mr, from where can I disable some effects. wut buzzez me is taht my laptop is new and it's that slow.
[08:26] <l3mr> diezare: did you enable compiz? also, maybe you didn't choose the proper driver for X
[08:27] <l3mr> diezare: what graphics card do you have?
[08:27] <nothlit> eilker, ABOSULUTELY NOT
[08:27] <l3mr> nothlit: he wants do destroy his data ;/
[08:27] <diezare> built-in intel accelerator 910
[08:27] <nothlit> eilker, DO NOT DO THAT or you will completely overwrite your harddrive with random data
[08:28] <nothlit> l3mr, no he wants to corrupt the mbr
[08:28] <diezare> l3mr, I didn't enable compiz
[08:28] <nothlit> eilker, you need to limit blocks
[08:28] <l3mr> diezare: good :)
[08:28] <diezare> l3mr, it's already installed while when I write cat /proc/cpuinfo it disaplayes 1 processor while before it used to display 2, i mean before in older versions of ubuntu.
[08:28] <l3mr> diezare: try 'uname -a'
[08:29] <eilker> nothlit: could you please correct it ? 'dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda'
[08:29] <diezare> <diezare> l3mr, it's already installed while when I write cat /proc/cpuinfo it disaplayes 1 processor while before it used to display 2, i mean before in older versions of ubuntu.
[08:29] <diezare> Linux diezare-laptop 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Tue Dec 5 22:26:18 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[08:29] <ehazlett> pike_: yeah, that's about what i came up with... ;)  grep'g ps...
[08:29] <l3mr> diezare: you are running the 386 kernel. not the generic with smp
[08:29] <diezare> l3mr, and how can I choose?
[08:30] <l3mr> diezare: you should probably change the default in /boot/grub/menu.lst, or just press esc during startup to get the grub menu
[08:30] <AlexC_> Hey,
[08:30] <AlexC_> Anyone know of a good PHP Editor?
[08:30] <nothlit> eilker i think you need bs=512 count=1 but lemme ask , because dd is a dangerous operation
[08:30] <diezare> l3mr, and when I get the grub menu will it set by default the kernel i choose everytime?
[08:31] <eilker> nothlit:  'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<dev> bs=512'
[08:31] <l3mr> diezare: no, grub menu lets you choose the kernel for 'this boot', if you edit /boot/grub/menu.lst you can change the default
[08:32] <l3mr> diezare: ok maybe my explanation is a bit confusing. grub menu = the boot menu you get when pressing ESC during the boot process.
[08:33] <nothlit> eilker, btw null = 0's and urandom = random data
[08:33] <nothlit> eilker, still waiting for response, gimme a sec
[08:33] <diezare> l3mr, i get u. i did this before in gentoo it's just it's little diffrent here, the file names.
[08:33] <eilker> nothlit: ok friend, thank you
[08:33] <diezare> l3mr, how can I choose the default kernel while editing the grub file?
[08:34] <l3mr> diezare: yeah every linux distro likes to rename some stuff to confuse people :) but of course the ubuntu / debian way is the way it's supposed to be done :)
[08:34] <nothlit> diezare, change the default to a different number
[08:34] <l3mr> diezare: there is an entry default (number)
[08:34] <l3mr> diezare: you most likely want to change it to 2
[08:34] <l3mr> instead of 0
[08:34] <marinosi> hello..i use edgy eft desktop with the generic kernel and i tried to set dma on to my disk but failed /dev/sda1:

[08:35] <diezare> i think it's 3 cause 2 is the recovery mode for 386
[08:35] <l3mr> diezare: hmm it starts with 0 afaik
[08:35] <marinosi> propably i have to recompile my kernel but ubuntu has only the headers in..where can i find the source package?
[08:35] <diezare> l3mr, oh, k thnx.
[08:35] <nothlit> dieman_, no its 2, it starts from 0
[08:35] <diezare> ## default num
[08:35] <diezare> # Set the default entry to the entry number NUM. Numbering starts from 0, and

[08:45] <nothlit> jengc0il, its probably no big deal, you just need to wait for it to finish, if after a while it still hasn't freed up you can do sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[08:45] <dhf> like i said
[08:45] <dhf> when i minimise
[08:45] <lasse__> then run the command nothlit told you to run. you know how to open a terminal dont you?
[08:45] <dhf> it vanishes
[08:45] <diezare> pike_, and the applications open fast, everything is great except the menu images.
[08:45] <pike_> diezare: i use them because i dont think half my system resources shoul be taken up by my desktop environment.  i like to save stuff like that for applications
[08:45] <towsonu2003> crimsun_, how can I solve this on a compiled kernel though?
[08:46] <pike_> diezare: ah
[08:46] <crimsun_> towsonu2003: track upstream
[08:46] <lasse__> dhf i see your problem. did you try the command nothlit told you to run?
[08:46] <jengc0il> thnkz guy
[08:46] <towsonu2003> crimsun_, okay thanks :)
[08:46] <dhf> no
[08:46] <dhf> which command
[08:46] <Crazyl1nk> cbx33: do you knhowwhere? im looking at the server.log and the admin passwords, but i dont know how to get the site up, im looking at it now they say to try http://yourservernameorIPhere.com:14534
[08:46] <Slart> Crazyl1nk: there is a log file somewhere (check the docs) created when you installed teamspeak.. in it is the port and default admin password
[08:46] <mrabbit> please help, im going out of my mind with the slow torrents
[08:46] <nothlit> dhf, i would also recommend logging out and back in afterwards
[08:46] <ragnar_123> hey guys!
[08:46] <ragnar_123> I've had samba running on my server (tiny server at home) and it just simply did kinda stop working. Anyone in here with a suggestion?
[08:46] <nothlit> aL-away, easiest way is to run this command in the terminal, rm -fr ~/.gconf && killall gnome-panel
[08:46] <diezare> pike_, I admire fluxbox. I use it on my PC but i use gnome on my lap cause sometimes my brother needs it or any other person in the family who wont be able to use fluxbox.
[08:46] <nothlit> !terminal | aL-away
[08:46] <ubotu> aL-away: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[08:46] <pike_> diezare: if you rm -fr ~/.g*  and alt-ctrl-bkspace does it still do it?
[08:47] <cbx33> Crazyl1nk, what does that give you?
[08:47] <nothlit> ragnar_123, sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
[08:47] <dhf> nothlit,
[08:47] <dhf> i tried that
[08:47] <ragnar_123> nothilt: will try
[08:47] <dhf> still when i minimised
[08:47] <dhf> the application
[08:47] <dhf> it goes
[08:48] <Crazyl1nk> cbx33: nothing, im not 100% sure what to punch into this address
[08:48] <lasse__> dhf then write killall gnome-panel in your terminal
[08:48] <cbx33> well what' sthe ip of the server
[08:48] <diezare> pike_, sorry I tried wut u said so iwas logged out.
[08:48] <dhf> when i installed ubuntoo it had 2 panel
[08:48] <dhf> one on top
[08:48] <tommyw> I have a samba problem I cant seem to find a solution for on the forums:  I can map successfully with the command line to a specific folder on the share but cannot successfully bring up the share in nautilus. I get the message: "colder contents could not be displayed...".
[08:48] <cbx33> just do
[08:48] <mrabbit> how can i permanently open a port in ubuntu
[08:48] <dhf> one at the bottom
[08:48] <jokoon> what means Obsoleted by: linux-image-generic ? I was told several times on this channel to install kernel for K7 architecture ...
[08:48] <dhf> i deleted the one in the bottom
[08:48] <lasse__> dhf then write killall gnome-panel in your terminal
[08:48] <diezare> pike_, it's alittle faster. But still what not I think itshould be.
[08:48] <cbx33> http://123.123.123.123:14534/
[08:48] <dhf> now when i minimise
[08:48] <nothlit> dhf, or you can right click on the bar, add applet, and add application list
[08:48] <nothlit> dhf, or you can right click on the bar, add applet, and add application list
[08:48] <diezare> pike_, but it's alot faster
[08:48] <gumpo> Whats the command that lets me manually configure my video settings? (I know my card and monitor are capable of a lot more then what i can pick from in the screen resolution menu.)
[08:48] <ragnar_123> nothilt: nothing did happen.. still same thing...
[08:49] <diezare> pike_, what was the command u said rm something?
[08:49] <nothlit> mrabbit, if you didn't add , its already open whenever a program wants it
[08:49] <Crazyl1nk> cbx33: i dont know would it be the 4 digit number the terminal gave me while running it? or my IP?
[08:49] <lasse__> no, dhf listen to us here. write killall gnome-panel in your terminal
[08:49] <cbx33> the ip of the server
[08:49] <cbx33> goto the server machien and type ifconfig on the terminal
[08:49] <mrabbit> except my torrent go slowly, and my router is set up fine, they go fast on other distros
[08:49] <[A] ndy80> hi
[08:49] <pike_> diezare: rm -fr  == remove force recursively(directories) all files begining with .g
[08:49] <nothlit> ragnar_123, it could be the windows election mechanism, you could try restarting the computer<S>
[08:49] <cbx33> or on the local server machine just do
[08:49] <dhf> i did
[08:49] <cbx33> http://localhost:14534/
[08:50] <cbx33> or whatever the port number is
[08:50] <mrabbit> ive heard of torrent problems on ubuntu, but no solutions are available
[08:50] <dhf> and what it done is refreshed the task bar i have
[08:50] <dhf> but still
[08:50] <diezare> what does that do?
[08:50] <dhf> like i minimised terminal now
[08:50] <dhf> and its gone again
[08:50] <[A] ndy80> I've a strange problem: every time I login into my ubuntu desktop (I'm using Edgy) Skype crashes. If I launch it again it doesn't crash. What could it be the problem?
[08:50] <dhf> task bar 1 is theer
[08:50] <nothlit> dhf, or you can right click on the bar, add applet, and add application list
[08:50] <dhf> but no ruunning application
[08:50] <nothlit> dhf, or you can right click on the bar, add applet, and add application list
[08:50] <lasse__> ok, then write the command nothlit told you to, then write killall gnome-anel
[08:50] <Crazyl1nk> could 6645 be it?
[08:50] <lasse__> *panel

=== freebsd_fan is now known as [a] freebsd_fan
[08:51] <diezare> pike_, what does rm -fr do?
[08:51] <ragnar_123> nothilt: I dont sit on a windows machine!!! are you crazy?...but it kinda like stop working after I installed fluxbox on the machine..
[08:51] <nothlit> rm -fr removes things recursively (into directories) and without complaint
[08:51] <dhf> its still now workin guys
[08:51] <pike_> diezare: rm = remove   so it removes whole directories
[08:51] <diezare> pike_, which directories while it remove?
[08:52] <lasse__> dhf what panels do you have now? top or bottom or both?
[08:52] <mrabbit> please help me get my torrents going as fast as they should, speeds hang around 15kb/s when they are capable of far more
[08:52] <pike_> diezare: whatever you specify .  we told it anything begining with .g in your home directory.  your gnome config files
[08:52] <Crazyl1nk> cbx33: could 6654 be it?
[08:52] <cbx33> hmmm
[08:52] <cbx33> that may actually be the teamspeack protocal port
[08:52] <dhf> i have one of them

[08:53] <pike_> diezare: if you ls -a youll see alot of files begining with a . that are normally hidden
[08:53] <dhf> system
[08:53] <nothlit> dhf, are you sure you added the windows list?
[08:53] <dhf> place
[08:53] <lasse__> right dhf enough
[08:53] <nothlit> dhf, MAKE SURE you have added the windows list in applets
[08:53] <pike_> diezare: shouldnt. themes should be stored elsewhere in /usr
[08:53] <lasse__> dhf, listen to me and just me now. dont get confused here
[08:53] <Crazyl1nk> cbx33: its the number i got from the terminal right after running the command to start up the server

[08:54] <pike_> diezare: anytime you have a problem with an app you can delete its .config file or directory to restore it to a default state
[08:54] <Crazyl1nk> cbx33: but that or my router IP wont help, the webpage window just keeps loading but doesnt run
[08:55] <diezare> pike_, k thnx alot. i'll give it a shot. and i'll restart then tell u.

[08:55] <Orangekid13> and firefox continues to open new windows when i have it supposed to open tabs

[09:12] <mrabbit> therefore it is ubuntu problem, as many complain about this, and everyone blaims there correctly configured routers and clients
[09:12] <Crazyl1nk> slart: do you mind helping me?
[09:12] <ToHellWithGA> my roommate has an nvidia GeForce2 MX card and would like to run a better driver than VESA.  What driver should he use?
[09:13] <dv_> gf2mx.. hm
[09:13] <lasse__> mrabbit check that your ports are forwarded to the right IP
[09:13] <dv_> the nv driver should do I guess
[09:13] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: I don't know, never faced that problem on my laptop (or desktop)
[09:13] <dv_> or older CS drivers,
[09:13] <fyrestrtr> ToHellWithGA: the 'nv' driver.
[09:13] <dv_> but the newest ones drop gf2 support
[09:13] <mrabbit> lasse__:I have my router set to DMZ for my ip, and ubuntu is supposed to open ports that apps try to use
[09:14] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: ubuntu doesn't open ports by itself.
[09:14] <lasse__> mrabbit, correcct

[09:14] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I uninstall madwifi?
[09:14] <lasse__> mrabbit; wow laggy
[09:14] <mrabbit> is there any way to make a port open all the time?
[09:14] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: are you using a firewall?
[09:14] <mrabbit> what?
[09:15] <mrabbit> errr, i dont think so
[09:15] <mrabbit> new to ubuntu :p
[09:15] <lasse__> fyrestrtr,then you arent :)
[09:15] <fyrestrtr> lasse__: I'm not what?
[09:15] <lasse__> fyrestrtr; oops wrong person
[09:15] <lasse__> mrabbit, then you arent :)
[09:16] <mrabbit> well, is there are way to open a port permanantly/
[09:16] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I uninstall?
[09:16] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: ports aren't gates that you open and shut. You have to have something (a program) listening on a port for it to open.
[09:16] <ragnar_123> Spaghetti_Knife: how did you install?
[09:16] <lontra> mrabbit: you can open a port by opening it on your router
[09:17] <lasse__> mrabbit try the netstat command
[09:17] <mrabbit> fyrestrtr:wrong, i opened ports in yast on suse nefore
[09:17] <Spaghetti_Knife> I svn'd it, then made it and make installed it.
[09:17] <ragnar_123> Spaghetti_Knife: or what to uninstakk?
[09:17] <mrabbit> lontra:ive already said my router is fine
[09:17] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: no, you didn't.
[09:17] <Spaghetti_Knife> madwifi.
[09:17] <Orangekid13> I still get the black screen with the " (no video) " with mplayer and the mozilla plugin
[09:17] <lontra> mrabbit: ok...then set it with the program you want to use
[09:17] <mrabbit> didnt wat?
[09:17] <lontra> to the port you've open
[09:17] <lontra> ed
[09:17] <mrabbit> lontra:prog is set, router is set, still slow downloads
[09:17] <lontra> if you opened 6885 tell azureus to listen to that port
[09:17] <lasse__> Orangekid13, what happens when you try to download a video and run it with mplayyer?
[09:18] <mrabbit> IVE DONE THAT!
[09:18] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: could be a bad torrent, have you ever thought of that possibility?
[09:18] <lontra> mrabbit: maybe others aren't
[09:18] <lontra> mrabbit: and chill out
[09:18] <lasse__> orangekid13: as a stand alone player
[09:18] <mrabbit> it downloads much faster on other distros
[09:18] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: where did you open it?
[09:18] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: *how* did you open it?
[09:18] <lasse__> mrabbit uses DMZ that should do it
[09:18] <mrabbit> so torrent is fine, opened via azureus open option
[09:18] <lontra> mrabbit: this is definitely not an ubuntu issue
[09:18] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: is azureus giving you the green smiley face?
[09:19] <LuisMendes> hello, please answer a small question: I'm using fglrx drivers for ATI Radeon 9600XT. Can I use AIGLX and Beryl? The driver is working, but "composite" is not supported (according to the Ubuntu wiki)
[09:19] <fyrestrtr> LuisMendes: no, you must use XGL.
[09:19] <lasse__> LuisMendes youll have to use XGL
[09:19] <fyrestrtr> LuisMendes: you can use beryl with xgl.
[09:19] <lasse__> ah too slow
[09:19] <mrabbit> lontra:hmm, weird logic, works fine in other distros so 'it cant be an ubuntu issue'
[09:19] <JanK> just a short off topic question (sorry): is "he correctly recognises that..." wrong?
[09:19] <majestik> how can i transform a 128kbps mp3 to a 56 kbps mp3?
[09:19] <mrabbit> fyrestrtr:yes
[09:20] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: then its not a problem with the ports, or ubuntu. You are just on a slow seeder.
[09:20] <FunnyMan3595> Okay, trying to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy here, through the update-manager.  It lost a couple packages somewhere in the middle of installing (not downloading) because it'd run out of disk space.  I cleared a bunch up, but when it hit the end, the install failed.  What's the best way to try and repair it?  The system's still up and running.
[09:20] <lontra> mrabbit: if it's green then it's the others seeding  and leaching
[09:20] <lontra> mrabbit: it's not ubuntu's fault...again
[09:20] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: just restart the install process.
[09:20] <JanK> majestik: search for "ffmpeg"
[09:20] <mrabbit> fyrestrtr:except that its been slow all day, and many people complain of slow dloads in ubuntu, but ill try another torrent to humour yiu
[09:20] <mrabbit> *you
[09:20] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Okay, that's what I figured, but I also thought I should come check, just in case.  :)
[09:21] <Orangekid13> when i try to play standalone i get "Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device."
[09:21] <Orangekid13> guess this means i get to figure out how to use the terminal to install the binary drivers for my nvidia card
[09:21] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: if the icon is green in azureus, that means that the problem is not with the network or the operating system. There is nothing in the ubuntu installation that will prevent you from downloading torrents.
[09:22] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: It's not liking that...
[09:22] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: error?
[09:22] <lasse__> orangekid13, sounds like a driver problem yeah
[09:22] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: At the CL it's complaining about dbus (could not initiate, could not send inhibit signal, did not get reply)
[09:23] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: ah yes, the lovely dbus.
[09:23] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: In the gui part, it lists two components to be upgraded, but they're greyed out and the top still says it's up-to-date.
[09:23] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: And the install button is also greyed out.
[09:23] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: what apps?
[09:23] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: apps = components.
[09:23] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: libggi2, mplayer
[09:24] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: logout of gnome, and log back in, try it again.
[09:24] <FunnyMan3595> Okay...  Here's hoping it'll log back in...
[09:24] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: don't restart the computer.
[09:24] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595:  if it doesn't THEN restart the PC. Those two things aren't critical.
[09:24] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Right.
[09:25] <ToHellWithGA> fyrestrtr: thanks for that.  his video performance is mui bueno now. :)
[09:26] <mrabbit> the NAT light keeps going grey, but the NAT test says OK for the port ive set in config
[09:26] <vijaymateti_> hello after installing the 64 bit AMD version of edgy eft my boot screen wnet black and white can any one explain why its so??
[09:27] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: that's not a ubuntu problem then :)
[09:27] <Orangekid13> the how-to for the driver tells me to do stuff that isn't there... i go into the synaptic packager manager, click settings > repositories, then it thinks a "Edit repository" dialog comes up for me to click add, but i just get "software sources" and no add button... there's an add button under the "third party" tab, but that has "APT line" and nothing about a "restricted copyright" checkbox that i'm supposed to check
[09:27] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: plenty of natting help at the azureus website and at portforward.com
[09:27] <Orangekid13> (this is the nvidia driver)
[09:27] <ivx> hey i am trying to get mysql working but i always get the error that package mysql-server-5.0 in not configured yet, how do i fix this
[09:27] <vijaymateti_> hey??
[09:27] <majestik> so i have ffmpeg, and lame, how do i convert a 128kbps mp3 to a 56kbps mp3?
[09:28] <fyrestrtr> ivx: try sudo dpkg-configure mysql-server-5.0
[09:28] <mrabbit> fyrestrtr:my router is set to dmz on my ip, azureus is fine on other distros, and it is configured exactly the same
[09:28] <FunnyMan3595> Well, the system decided to hang on logout.
[09:29] <Detox_away> can I get an opinion on which iso to get?
[09:29] <FunnyMan3595> The new kernel wouldn't boot, which is probably because (as I was informed on startup) /boot is 100% full.
[09:29] <mrabbit> fyrestrtr:and it cant be a slow seeder, because i am connected to 7 seeders
[09:29] <Aldoliel> Detox_away, if you like
[09:29] <Strang3> Hello
[09:29] <sharperguy> lontra, with Seveas' repo enabled you can
[09:29] <sharperguy> ! Seveas
[09:29] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[09:29] <ivx> fyrestrtr: it says sudo: dpkg-configure: command not found
[09:29] <Detox_away> I have a  Dell Poweredge 1950 with two Xenon 3ghz cpu's  two HD's with raid
[09:30] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: please, stop saying 'its fine on other distros'.
[09:30] <fyrestrtr> ivx: sorry, dpkg-reconfigure
[09:30] <Detox_away> the hd's are mirrored
[09:30] <mrabbit> fyrestrtr:why, its true
[09:30] <FunnyMan3595> Old kernel brought up a new gooey, but the mouse cursor is borked on one of the two monitors.
[09:30] <Infeliz> lol
[09:30] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: then switch back :)
[09:30] <Detox_away> [   ]  ubuntu-6.10-server-amd64.iso     ??
[09:30] <vijaymateti_> yes
[09:30] <ivx> fyrestrtr it says: it is broken or not fully installed,
[09:31] <mrabbit> fyrestrtr:no, because ubuntu beats the other distros ive tried in many other ways, such as updates working properly
[09:31] <fyrestrtr> ivx: try sudo apt-get install --reinstall mysql-server-5.0
[09:31] <Detox_away> yes to me?
[09:31] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: I can assure you, the problem is not with ubuntu -- as there is no problem on my laptop downloading torrents using azureus.
[09:32] <Aldoliel> Detox_away, if they're 64bit CPU's that might be a good choice, some apps aren't availible for 64bit though
[09:32] <fyrestrtr> mrabbit: if there was, it would be all over launchpad and probably in the /topic of this channel, as there are a lot of torrent users.
[09:32] <Detox_away> all I will be using is servoy , and sybase
[09:32] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Could still be an incompatibility between Ubuntu and his particular hardware setup.
[09:32] <Detox_away> no other except maybe text editor and term
[09:33] <fyrestrtr> I doubt that has anything to do with torrents being slow.
[09:33] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: No idea WHY, but it's possible.
[09:33] <fyrestrtr> a hardware problem would not manifest itself in ONE application.
[09:33] <Detox_away> and I understand it sees raid ok?
[09:33] <ivx> fyrestrtr, it said the same thing when trying to install, not configured, but it also said in the begining part where 1 reinstalled that 2 not fully installed, how do i know what 2
[09:33] <Detox_away> if this is the wrong place to ask let em know
[09:33] <fyrestrtr> it would crop up everywhere (just ask me -- I have the problem with my intel wifi because of a bug in the firmware).
[09:33] <Aldoliel> Detox_away,  If they're compiled for 64bit, go for it. Raid should be fine
[09:33] <Detox_away> good
[09:33] <fyrestrtr> ivx: have you tried removing it?
[09:34] <Detox_away> thanks
[09:34] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Okay, I'm getting the exact same symptom from update-manager after the reboot.
[09:34] <Aldoliel> No worries
[09:34] <ivx> fyrestrtr, i'll try that again, is it sudo apt-remove or what?
[09:34] <fyrestrtr> ivx: sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server-5.0
[09:35] <fyrestrtr> heh, cool -- in my flight sim game, its showing the aurora borealis.
[09:35] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Good idea or bad to try and run updates with apt-get, since the gui's not working?
[09:35] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: you aren't on edgy yet, right?
[09:36] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Yes and no.  Like I said, the gui changed on startup, even with the old kernel.
[09:36] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: So I think I'm in an inconsistent halfway state.
[09:36] <WizCraker> is there anything I need to do in order to connect to mysql remotely?  I'm trying to use the free mysql tools but unable to get a connection.
[09:36] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: lsb_release -a
[09:37] <FunnyMan3595> codename edgy
[09:37] <fyrestrtr> WizCraker: 1) make sure mysql is listening on your public IP address, not localhost 2) add a user with access rights from the remote ip in mysql.
[09:37] <jb0nd38372> ivx: do you have encryption turned on in other distro's?  and possible not in ubuntu?  my isp is actually slower with encryption off... in windows I was using Utorrent, with enc off it was much slower at seeding and downloading, while turned on, with good seeders I got near 100% isp speeds
[09:37] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:37] <ivx> fyrestrtr, i removed it and installed again, and when it tried to start it it says fail, invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action "start" failed
[09:38] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: *nods*  Rightyo
[09:38] <fyrestrtr> ivx: anything in the logs? this is strange.
[09:38] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Looks like that's pulling those two packages.
[09:38] <ivx> fyrestrtr what is the path of the log i should look at, it was all fine untill i updated
[09:39] <fyrestrtr> ivx: updated what?
[09:39] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: might be a good time (after its done) to enable multiverse/universe
[09:39] <ivx> fyrestrtr, the ubuntu updates, kernel headers, ect. and i tried to boot the old one, and it isn't showing up in grub
[09:39] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: and run apt-get update and apt-get distupgrade again.
[09:39] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Hmm, on a second check, it says "The followign packages have been kept back"
[09:39] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: And lists the two again.
[09:40] <wildchild> hello there how can I know what hardware do I have on my computer?
[09:40] <orangefly> i am using webmin to configure my server, i give write permissions but still can't write to share....any idea why....???....
[09:40] <wildchild> is there any app, or it exists simple command for this?
[09:40] <LuisMendes> which should I use: compiz or beryl?
[09:40] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: okay, remove them both and reinstall them from the edgy repos (enable multiverse/universe first)
[09:40] <fyrestrtr> wildchild: lshq
[09:40] <fyrestrtr> wildchild: lshw
[09:41] <jb0nd38372> LuisMendes: Personally beryl works good for me... i'm running 0.1.3 and it's fairly stable
[09:41] <fyrestrtr> LuisMendes: compiz for (relative) stability beryl for better eye candy.
[09:41] <jlmb> I need to set up a RAID1 on my existing ubuntu server. Is it possible to configure it without having to reinstall?
[09:41] <orangefly> is edgy that much better than dapper....???...
[09:41] <wildchild> fyrestrtr: thx
[09:42] <LuisMendes> fyrestrtr, jb0nd38372: thank you!
[09:42] <LuisMendes> I'll choose Beryl then
[09:42] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: webmin is not supported under debian/ubuntu.
[09:42] <jb0nd38372> LuisMendes: hehe conflicting answers never help.. but its all dependant on your hardware and how  you use it
[09:43] <fyrestrtr> LuisMendes: if your video card has great drivers, then it doesn't matter which you choose.
[09:43] <orangefly> the webmin site says it is....
[09:43] <LuisMendes> <jb0nd38372>, well I want to check the eye candy, and I have an ATI radeon 9600XT
[09:43] <fyrestrtr> !webmin
[09:43] <ubotu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
[09:43] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: listen to the all-mighty ubotu
[09:43] <orangefly> anything similar that work....???....
[09:44] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: personally, I only use ssh to admin my servers.
[09:44] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: so I don't know of any alternatives, others might.
[09:44] <jb0nd38372> LuisMendes: eek... I have heard from reading here that ati support is buggy for cards that dont use the radeion driver, but use the ... fyrestrtr knows the answer to that... Nvidia support is good.. i'm not good with ati though, sorry
[09:44] <orangefly> is edgy that much better than dapper....???...
[09:45] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: if you like updated packages, then yes. If you want long term support and stability, then you should stick with dapper.
[09:45] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: I run dapper on my server, and edgy on my laptop.
[09:45] <banjooie> Alright, does anyone have like, a checklist of things I should look for if my sound doesn't work.
[09:45] <orangefly> i meant for a server....
[09:45] <LuisMendes> <fyrestrtr>, for using Beryl, should I use fglrx or the drivers from ATI website?
[09:45] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: go with dapper.
[09:46] <banjooie> Cause lspci picks up my sound card.
[09:46] <ivx> fyrestrt, do you have any other ideas?
[09:46] <banjooie> Amarok makes motions that indicate it's got the right drivers.
[09:46] <jackyyll> hey guys, how do i set up mod_python?
[09:46] <VividHazE> Hey everyone i'm trying to find the Bus ID no. of my HP Scanjet 3970 scanner so i can run the command sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/001/002 and add permissions for it, but i don't know how to find it
[09:46] <fyrestrtr> LuisMendes: it doesn't matter. Beryl doesn't care, its just a window manager. You need to use XGL not AIGLX with ATI's fglrx drivers.
[09:46] <VividHazE> anyone know a command or menu in Kubuntu for this?
[09:46] <brainsik> jackyyll: install the package and then enable it in apache
[09:46] <LuisMendes> <fyrestrtr>, ok then, I think I'm all set :)
[09:46] <AlexC_> hey guys,
[09:47] <AlexC_> Firefox isn't opening links in new tabs sometimes, it's really annoying
[09:47] <wildchild> fyrestrtr: can't find any description of my graphic card with command lshw
[09:47] <fyrestrtr> jackyyll: sudo apt-get isntall libapache-mod-python-2.4 && sudo a2enmod mod_python
[09:47] <jackyyll> thanks
[09:47] <AlexC_> I have it set to open in new tabs, but it doesn't sometimes
[09:47] <fyrestrtr> jackyyll: atleast I think that's right....
[09:47] <brainsik> fyrestrtr: libapache2-*
[09:48] <jackyyll> couldnt find package :s
[09:48] <fyrestrtr> brainsik: ah yeah.
[09:48] <brainsik> jackyyll: try libapache2-mod-python
[09:48] <VividHazE> can anyone help me with my problem above?
[09:48] <fyrestrtr> jackyyll: its libapache2-mod-python2.4
[09:48] <jackyyll> there we go :D
[09:48] <jackyyll> thanks
[09:48] <Helpmeee> I tried to use the command: sudo aptitude install xorg-dev and I get a msg: Resolving dependencies... Unable to resolve dependencies. giving up... Abort.
[09:48] <fyrestrtr> VividHazE: lsusb
[09:48] <VividHazE> thanks fyrestrtr
[09:49] <brainsik> jackyll: you can use 'apt-cache search' to find packages. For example, 'apt-cache search mod python'
[09:49] <jackyyll> ooh
[09:49] <jackyyll> ic
[09:49] <jackyyll> thanks guys
[09:49] <fyrestrtr> jackyyll: also http://packages.ubuntu.com
[09:49] <fyrestrtr> !packages
[09:49] <ubotu> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!

[09:49] <orangefly> how do you install a vpn from a terminal....???....
[09:50] <fyrestrtr> orangefly: sudo apt-get install openvpn (and then configure it)
[09:51] <Orangekid13> ok does anyone know how to get to the "restricted" section of the ubuntu package repository?
[09:51] <Orangekid13> trying to get my nvidia drivers installed
[09:51] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Okay, looks like it's got those two installed now.  The kernel image is probably still bad, but I've got the old one and a 2.6.19 image I can use if need be.  Let me try another restart here...
[09:51] <fyrestrtr> !universe | Orangekid13

[09:53] <iwkse> any help with gnome gconf files? i need to modify the default icon theme by here
[09:53] <Orangekid13> fuck ubotu
[09:53] <WizCraker_> fyrestrtr:  so I should set bind-address in my.cnf (mysql)  to the public IP so that I can access it remotely?

[09:53] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[09:53] <un_operateur1> Orangekid13, you can just add something like this to your sources.list  - deb http://uk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy main multiverse restricted universe
[09:53] <fyrestrtr> WizCraker_: yes, then make sure you add a user that has rights to access mysql from a remote ip. By default, all users only have access rights from localhost.
[09:53] <Crazyl1nk> i need help configing my router to allow people to connect to my Teamspeak server
[09:54] <fyrestrtr> Crazyl1nk: www.portforward.com
[09:54] <Orangekid13> still need help finding the restricted section of the package repository
[09:54] <Crazyl1nk> fyrestrtr: do you have EXP with Teamspeak?
[09:54] <Orangekid13> the nvidia binary drivers i need are in there
[09:54] <fyrestrtr> Orangekid13: read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories
[09:55] <fyrestrtr> Crazyl1nk: no, but plenty of experience in port forwarding :)
[09:55] <WizCraker_> fyrestrtr: thanks for the help. :)
[09:55] <Crazyl1nk> can you help personaly? im new to this kinda thing
[09:55] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Okay, that's mostly a success.  The new kernel worked after all, apt must've repaired it.  I still have a glitched cursor, though.
[09:56] <fyrestrtr> Crazyl1nk: just go to the site I mentioned. Find your router model/number. Adjust the ports to the ones that teamspeak uses. Its that simple.
[09:56] <nofeardjb> Crazyl1nk: portforward.com is crazy easy! :D
[09:56] <Ademan> the gnome save file dialog loses the file name when you change folders...
[09:56] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: On one monitor, it shows up about the size of a desktop icon, and filled with what looks like a bad sampling of either my desktop or my theme.\
[09:56] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: 'glitched'?
[09:56] <rapid> Crazyl1nk, open a web connection to your router and forward the powers
[09:56] <djembe> does gnome-obex-send or the nautilus-sendto (obex) programs work for anyone?
[09:56] <rapid> Crazyl1nk, er ports
[09:56] <Crazyl1nk> im in my router now
[09:56] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: sounds like something proper drivers could fix.
[09:56] <Orangekid13> ANYONE KNOW HOW TO GET TO THE RESTRICTED SECTION OF THE UBUNTU PACKAGE REPOSITORY?!?!?!?
[09:56] <Crazyl1nk> i have the list of ports Teamspeak uses
[09:56] <FunnyMan3595> ! caps | Orangekid13
[09:56] <ubotu> Orangekid13: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[09:56] <Orangekid13> PLEASE
[09:56] <rapid> Crazyl1nk, look for port redirection / forwarding
[09:57] <Crazyl1nk> but yeah its like having 2 batteries but not knowing which is + and whats -
[09:57] <fyrestrtr> Orangekid13: I have told you twice, un_operateur1 already told you once. Stop shouting and go to the pages I tell you to go to, and read them.
[09:57] <Orangekid13> yeah but you like to ignore both
[09:57] <Helpmeee> I tried to use the command: sudo aptitude install xorg-dev and I get a msg: Resolving dependencies... Unable to resolve dependencies. giving up... Abort.
[09:57] <Orangekid13> i'm on a friggen how to from help.ubuntu.com
[09:57] <Orangekid13> and it's not working
[09:57] <fyrestrtr> Helpmeee: see if there is a bug at LP for it.
[09:57] <Orangekid13> it's expecting different windows than are coming up from its directions
[09:57] <fyrestrtr> Helpmeee: if not, file one :)
[09:57] <Tonren> Hey guys, does anyone here own a System 76 computer?  Can anyone tell me where I can go to read reviews and stuff?
[09:58] <fyrestrtr> Tonren: #ubuntu-offtopic please
[09:58] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Graphics driver, I assume?  Unless the upgrade switched it, I'm on vesa at the moment, I could swap back to ati.
[09:58] <Orangekid13> someone else try it if they don't believe me https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[09:58] <Tonren> fyrestrtr: No doubt
[09:58] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: suggest you install it first, as with the new kernel, you probably need the new driver.
[09:58] <jbfavre> good evening everybody, I've got a software Raid problem with 3 firewire disks
[09:58] <power83> hi
[09:59] <power83> ubuntu 6.10 with bugs???
[09:59] <nofeardjb> Orange: i've installed automatix2 and just installed the nvidia drivers that way
[09:59] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: if you are on a laptop, go for the fglrx drivers (better power safe / suspend+resume support)
[09:59] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: I take it the upgrade wouldn't upgrade that?
[09:59] <FunnyMan3595> !automatix | nofeardjb
[09:59] <ubotu> nofeardjb: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[09:59] <mike1980> hi guys could anyone please tell me the command to install kde AND X on by unbuntu server plase?
[09:59] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: no, it didn't for me.
[09:59] <nofeardjb> rgr that
[09:59] <power83> I've installe d alternate-i386 on Pentium D 930, but the kernel don't boot
[09:59] <jbfavre> The array isn't properly reconstruct on boot because md0 set up before the complete recognition of the disks
[09:59] <jbfavre> any idea ?
[09:59] <fyrestrtr> mike1980: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[09:59] <power83> it stopped the first line "Starting up..."
[09:59] <nofeardjb> !WorksforMe
[09:59] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[09:59] <FunnyMan3595> fyrestrtr: Nope, main system with a dual-head card.
[10:00] <mike1980> fyrestrtr: thanks
[10:00] <fyrestrtr> FunnyMan3595: okay, then you can try the fglrx drivers in the repos :) Instructions are (as always) at the wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Video -- make sure you pay attention to edgy-specific stuff.

[10:05] <shwag> nothlit: well... specifically im having trouble getting configuration for remote servers to work.
[10:05] <stefg> Pf123b: because there's an invisible propmpt for your password .-) .. try gksudo gedit

[10:07] <eyalw> hi!
[10:07] <eyalw> I need your help
[10:07] <ollekalle> Slart: usually I fail to start it at all. I use the nvidia-generic driver
[10:08] <shwag> how do I clear out extra files that I no longer need...which apt saves.
[10:08] <StephenL> jrib: intersting.  guess i have just never experienced that.
[10:08] <stefg> dave_: no... vcd's can be beasts... so much to look after to get a workink VCD.. k3b assists you in converting the video into the proper format, but you still have to know, what you're doing
[10:08] <Slart> ollekalle: have you tried the binary driver from nvidia?
[10:08] <eyalw> I just installed apache, php and mySQL. now i wanna configure httpd.conf but it looks very suspiciously short, not like my server on windows
[10:08] <Pf123b> is there any other ways of starting gedit with root?

[10:08] <ubotu> eyalw: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:08] <Pf123b> eyalw, try apache2.conf
[10:08] <Slart> ollekalle: just to check if it's the driver or something else
[10:09] <jrib> StephenL: I haven't either, and I think it's really a bug with the program.  I know k3b used to do this and many people would sudo because they didn't have proper permissions on their cd drive.  But that has since been fixed
[10:09] <stefg> Pf123b: gksudo gedit
[10:09] <nofeardjb> eyalw: windows apache and linux apache files are set up a little differently
[10:09] <eyalw> Pf123b: whats the different?
[10:09] <intrepidus> Whenever I right-click the menus appear -behind- the windows instead of on them - is that normal?
[10:09] <Pf123b> stefg, gksudo and sudo gedit dont doanything
[10:09] <eyalw> ha, i get it
[10:09] <Pf123b> eyalw, atleast with me, apache2.conf is long :p

[10:15] <eyalw> so we cant change it??...
[10:15] <Pf123b> yes I can run gedit, but when it comes to modifing my php.ini, read only soo...thats why I want sudo
[10:16] <Pf123b> eyalw, im not sure how
[10:16] <StephenL> ok...and what is the error you get when you try to run it as root?

[10:16] <eyalw> ok, thats not that importent
[10:16] <Pf123b> and blinks, it looks like its crying
[10:17] <Pf123b> its weird because it was working fine yesterday

[10:19] <Pf123b> pike_, what do i do?
[10:20] <arrenlex> StephenL: The same thing happens for inkscape, which isn't a KDE app.
[10:20] <Slart> ollekalle: nope.. monitor caps should either work forever or not at all.. unless your monitor is severly damages I guess =)
[10:20] <ollekalle> Slart: i.e. I lowered the freqs already in conf file - and success! (at least for a minute now)
[10:20] <StephenL> arrenlex: but you are still in kde...
[10:20] <Slart> ollekalle: you can always do the sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:20] <arrenlex> StephenL: Can you please explain to me how kde interferes with sudo?
[10:20] <ollekalle> Slart: what will it do?
[10:21] <WizCraker_> after changing the mysql listening ip address and then restarting i get the infamous stopping server from pid file error.. I assumed that I could get more information by looking at the logs in /var/log but the mysql.log files are empty.  Am I looking in the wrong place?
[10:21] <Slart> ollekalle: lets you set driver, freqs, language etc
[10:21] <StephenL> arrenlex: it doesn't.  its something to do with environment variables is my guess getting changed when you su to root
[10:21] <brady_> is there a dictionary meta-package to install all/most of the dictionaries?
[10:21] <ollekalle> slart: I manually modifid the xorg.conf, basically the same I suppose?
[10:21] <Slart> ollekalle: yup
[10:21] <userek> how can change text console resolution? it uses 720x400, its hard to find more undstandard mode ;)

[10:22] <arrenlex> !anyone | loz
[10:22] <ubotu> loz: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[10:22] <Slart> ollekalle: the bin driver offers hardware acceleration
[10:23] <Slart> ollekalle: so, no gaming while using this one =)
[10:23] <Pf123b> Well StephenL, arrenlex, stefg im going to reboot this laptop, and hope for the best, that sudo/sudo -i/gksudo starts working magicly again
[10:23] <HymnToLife> monkey050, chech your BIOS battery
[10:23] <ollekalle> Slart: 3d-acceleration? what about mpeg2 decoder for DVD?
[10:23] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Hi Hymn.
[10:23] <Slart> ollekalle: no 3d-acceleration.. don't think you'll get any of the goodies you paid lots of money for..
[10:23] <StephenL> arrenlx: see here: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=214578  it is indeed an environment variable problem.
[10:23] <loz> can anybody guide me to a link for connecting two ubuntus together via ssh?
[10:24] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Is there a way I can do that easily on my laptop?
[10:24] <Slart> ollekalle: but it works alright in 2d mode..
[10:24] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I don't have easy access to the Mobo.
[10:24] <HymnToLife> I don't think so
[10:24] <StephenL> arrenlex: *
[10:24] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Agh.
[10:24] <stefg> loz: sudo aptitude install openssh-server .... that's it, basically
[10:24] <monkey050-Ubuntu> By the way, i'm on Ubuntu now. lol
[10:24] <sivik_> is there another program other, but like mythtv
[10:24] <arrenlex> StephenL: But not a KDE problem. Which means there is no reason that it should have worked for pf123b.
[10:24] <Slart> ollekalle: and you'll sleep well at night knowing it's open source... well.. also since you won't be up playing quake you'll have nothing to keep you up =)
[10:25] <ollekalle> Slart: paid lots for. Actually I bought the cheapest nVidia card I could find with TV-out capability :D
[10:25] <StephenL> arrenlex: then why does it work fine for me?
[10:25] <monkey050-Ubuntu> OK well thanks for the answer.  I was fearing that would be it - not a big problem anyway.
[10:25] <Slart> ollekalle: hehe.. ok.. not so much money then
[10:25] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Also, I did those GRUB edits you told me.
[10:25] <arrenlex> StephenL: Possibly you have that variable set. Is it in your /root/.bashrc?
[10:25] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I couldn't do the devices.map thing that frogzoo told me though.
[10:26] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It came up blank.

[10:28] <vlt> Hello. i just installed Ubuntu Edgy 6.10 and the pkg vnc4server. When I start a server `vncserver :1` it says ok but doesn't run. The logfile tells mwe something about missing fonts. There was such an issue on breezy, I remember. What to do on edgy now?

[10:28] <devnull_> hello i just upgraded to edgy and have no text in my xmms menus
[10:28] <refus3d> help please want to create a mixture of various icons themes how?
[10:28] <StephenL> arrenlex: That's because it is set by gdm...which is why you don't have it.  Which is also why sudo -i will work just fine under ubuntu
[10:28] <vlt> dreamer: qemu?
[10:28] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Dreamer:  You'd have to mount it to something somehow.  Similar to daemon tools on windows.  I don't know exactly though.
[10:28] <dreamer> hmm
[10:28] <dreamer> !qemu
[10:28] <ubotu> qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo

[10:29] <johns^> movie?
[10:29] <dreamer> hmm, like, to play it (aka Alcohol 120% ?) without burning
[10:29] <dreamer> it's software
[10:29] <lontra> is there a flashplugin 9 deb somewhere?

[10:30] <spacepod> can anyone point me to information on setting up samba to have password protected folders
[10:30] <lontra> Slart: 32 bit
[10:30] <devnull_> i think i might have battled this issue when i installed dapper

[10:30] <FunnyMan3595> Okay, I need some help getting xorg.conf set up with the new driver.
[10:30] <mralphabet> dreamer: see link ^^
[10:30] <johns^> spacepod: password protected folders are not possible afiak
[10:30] <johns^> userlevel access however is
[10:30] <Slart> lontra: there is an installer from adobe... I can't use it (I use 64bit).. but it's supposed to work
[10:30] <dreamer> thnx mralphabet
[10:30] <vlt> A solution for vnc server and font problem anyone?
[10:31] <devnull_> aswell as i am having issues getting connected to my wireless network again like before i had network manager on dapper
[10:31] <FunnyMan3595> At first, I think it had the two monitors reversed from the old version, since the right hand monitor showed the default X cursor when I moved the mouse left (like the left used to do), and the left was showing "mode not supported", probably because it has a lower res cap.
[10:31] <spacepod> well lets say i want to setup a private folder only allowing a specific users to log into it.. how would i go about doing that
[10:31] <devnull_> does the upgrade leave stuff behind and not install all needed software ?
[10:31] <ollekalle> anyone have a good suggestion on how I can assure my graphics works. e.g. is there some terminal sw that is constantly moving like the amiga bounce demo?
[10:32] <arrenlex> ollekalle: glxgears
[10:32] <spacepod> i just used the installer lontra
[10:32] <FunnyMan3595> Running dexconf got me a working display, but it's a double-display of the same screen, at low resolution.
[10:32] <johns^> spacepod: setup a share and add an option "valid user = username"
[10:32] <stefg> vlt: i don't know if this relates to your problem, but i found that vino (gnomes vnc-server) doesn't start automatically because of a bug. I added /usr/lib/vino-server to my autostarted apps to fix that
[10:32] <ivx> hey when i try sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart it returns nothing, anyone know why?
[10:32] <Maxime> Can anyone help me?
[10:32] <spacepod> just take a look at the readme file.. you have to run the intaller from command line.. and place it into the firefox directory

[10:34] <monkey050> Why did they take out 2 workspaces after Badger???
[10:34] <spacepod> johns how would i then login to that share via xp?
[10:34] <Gumby> ubuntu: did you just update to a new kernel?
[10:34] <johns^> uhh, I use samba as a domain master
[10:35] <johns^> so a log in to the domain and the logon scripts take care of the connections
[10:35] <mralphabet> spacepod: from windows explorer, \\ip_address in the address bar
[10:35] <ubuntu> i repartitioned one of the windows partitions using partition magic and when i restarted the computer the grub showed a msg called error 17
[10:35] <StephenL> shaba1: System -> Preferences -> Sessions -> Startup Programs
[10:35] <Shaba1> devnu11 what is rc.d Is that a specific distro file/program or does it come with all versions of linux
[10:35] <ubuntu> i am now booting from live cd
[10:35] <johns^> spacepod: I got a commented smb.conf
=== ProN00b is now known as ProN00bX
[10:35] <Gumby> ubuntu: you probably need to reinstall grub (or you acidentally formatted a partition you needed)
[10:35] <johns^> never mind, it's in dutch
[10:35] <spacepod> hrrm i obviously need to do more reading.. what would be a good url to look at

[10:58] <khaled83> stefg, do u think i will have to reinstall the system?
[10:58] <phaedra> captain_laredo,  Okay...  That sounds like a hardware problem...  If the live cd can't recognize it and the bios has it as unknown try to get it back into the bios listing.
[10:58] <korupt> does anyone know the package that provides mono.unix?
[10:58] <matos> hello!!
[10:59] <kane77> is it possible to install stuff running the live cd?
[10:59] <un_operateur1> have you tried searching for mono.unix via apt-cache/aptitude?

[11:00] <korupt> un_operateur1: many many times
[11:00] <phaedra> captain_laredo,  It might be a lose connection.  Try that but it won't operate properly until the bios can get it setup.
[11:00] <phaedra> s lose/loose
[11:01] <stefg> khaled83: No.. you just have to adjust the /etc/fstab of your installed system to reflect the new partition-layout, and then get grub back in conditition.  Type 'exit' at tze grub-prompt and then try 'sudo grub-install' in your chrooted terminal

[11:01] <un_operateur1> korupt, I've never come across a package by that name -- what does it do? i might be able to help if you tell me more about it's functionality
[11:01] <captain_laredo> phaedra...yeah...I'll check that out....It's just weird...the Drive opens and closes and acts like it's reading the CD...but I still get that message...Oh well...I'll figure it out eventually...THanks :)

[11:15] <Faintofhearts> stefg: It was able to run Quake on Windows without a problem.
[11:15] <Faintofhearts> So I know the hardware is capable.
[11:15] <dreamer> Shaba1: donated huh? :)
[11:16] <Shaba1> I need to find some way of NOT letting users get to the desktop even to use the machines unless they are verified by my win2k AD server.

[11:19] <khaled83> stefg, this means yes, right?
[11:19] <Shaba1> Right now I have systems policies set so that the user turns on the machine and it gives him a dialog box to enter a user name and password. That is then verified against the users and groups I have set up on the win2k server. Once verified a logon.bat files then runs a kicktart script the user then gets a different desktop and permission to files on the server based on which group he/she is in.
[11:19] <Faintofhearts> stefg: It should be possible though, correct? I mean, I have had it running on this machine before, with this exact hardware. Any idea what I could be missing that keeps it from working properly?
[11:19] <stefg> khaled83: yes, that's yes :-)
[11:20] <Shaba1> So I am wanting to get these new machines that arrive monday to do that same thing
[11:20] <userek> how can i disable cups daemon?
[11:20] <abo> hi, I have all the video working under the K desktop but not under gnome, I have obviously all codecs installed, any ideas?
[11:20] <Crazyl1nk> i need help
[11:20] <userek> when i want to uninstal cups
[11:20] <Shaba1> YES I know about samba but that goes the other way.
[11:20] <userek> it wants to uinstall ubuntu-desktop
[11:20] <stefg> Faintofhearts: as I said... DirectX
[11:20] <Shaba1> Letting windows machines talk to linux file shares. I want it the other way around.
[11:20] <pike_> defrex: first thing "rm -fr ~/.g*"  maybe
[11:20] <Faintofhearts> stefg: Downloadable on Linux?
[11:20] <Faintofhearts> I wasn't sure.
[11:20] <StephenL> shaba1: no it does both
[11:20] <stefg> Faintofhearts: beware... no
[11:20] <mralphabet> eilker: with p4 2.8 and 2gb ram I am at desktop in ~1min . . . what is the memory usage on your machine?
[11:20] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Can someone help me figure out how to get Rhythmbox to work?
[11:20] <khaled83> stefg, and the rest should i choose primary or extended?
[11:20] <Crazyl1nk> i need help setting up my router for static IPs
[11:20] <Faintofhearts> No...
[11:20] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Rhythmbox won't play ANYTHING.
[11:21] <mralphabet> Shaba1: samba goes both ways
[11:21] <defrex> pike_: I'm using a live cd atm... should I giver witht hat anyway?
[11:21] <mralphabet> Shaba1: look at smbmount
[11:21] <idigital> crimsun_?
[11:21] <Faintofhearts> So... I will need to find something to replace DirectX...
[11:21] <idigital> how ?
[11:21] <mralphabet> !smbmount
[11:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smbmount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:21] <mralphabet> bah ;(
[11:21] <justin420> anybody have problems have with gnome after upgrading the recent kernl vuln? i cant right click on my desktop; im that damn close to reinstalling windows as my primary OS; which i really dont want to do, any ideas anyone?
[11:22] <pike_> defrex: well youd mount your ubuntu parition and then rm -fr /media/mountpoint/home/username/.g*
[11:22] <stefg> khaled83: i'll keep my system partitons ( /var and swap) primary, and my data-partitions (/home, /media ) logical. But that's just an arbitrary convention
[11:22] <leny> !biarch
[11:22] <ubotu> A BiArch 64-bit system is one that comes with a complete 32-bit package system, as well. This means that you can run 32bit packages as well on your 64-bit install
[11:22] <Jako> Hey

[11:22] <eyalw> hi, i've got a problem connecting to mySQL through php on apache
[11:22] <eilker> mralphabet: at the moment % 68 is free
[11:23] <khaled83> stefg, ok thanks, the last question hopefully, i was once told that the swap partition should be equal to my ram, is this true?

[11:23] <stefg> khaled83: oh... wait /media is already used ... errrr call it /multimedia
[11:23] <sports_fan> unfortunatly none of these ideas have solvced my issue. thanks for the effort guys.
[11:23] <crimsun_> idigital: yes, with the command I gave you before
[11:23] <magic_ninja> anyone in here use cedega
[11:23] <Shaba1> did I lose you StephenL?
[11:23] <stefg> khaled83: nowaday all rules of thumb fail miserably... how much ram do you have?
[11:24] <StephenL> shaba1: no im just reading several different things at once
[11:24] <defrex> pike_: uh, sorry, how do I mount the drive?
[11:24] <idigital> i did with "snd-cmi8330"but now its saying bash: snd-cmi8330: command not found
[11:24] <khaled83> stefg, 1G
[11:24] <Crazyl1nk> i need help setting up my router for static IPs
[11:25] <AngryElf> could someone in here who has a XP/ubuntu dual boot be so kind as to pastebin their /boot/grub/menu.lst for me?
[11:25] <stefg> khaled83: so you'll never use more than 256 MB of swap (or you are in a very special situation) call it 512 MB swap...
[11:25] <kane77> i have ubuntu installed on a disk partition. on the same disk there's a windows partition (fat32). How can I decrease the Fat32 size and increase my linux partition???
[11:25] <mralphabet> Shaba1: have you looked at smbmount before?
[11:25] <khaled83> stefg, ok
[11:26] <leny> Is this the right place to ask if Edgy ever made BiArch for x86 and if so how to (practically) install 32-bit libraries etc.
[11:26] <pike_> defrex: well id just reboot into my computer and when x crashed alt-ctrl-f2 then login then type rm -fr ~/.g*  then alt-ctrl-f7 to get back to x
[11:26] <jtrejo> hi
[11:26] <mralphabet> Shaba1: you can also look at sshfs
[11:26] <jtrejo> I need wireless help badly:(
[11:26] <idigital> crimsum what the command was $ snd-cmi8330
[11:26] <idigital> correct
[11:26] <defrex> pike_: will do...
[11:27] <kane77> jtrejo, what's up?

[11:28] <leny> jtrejo: Sorry stuck with WiFi on my Powerbook  :-)
[11:28] <mralphabet> eilker: if that is really your memory usage, then it seems long to get to the gnome desktop
[11:28] <brucedes> I'm trying to install 6.10 on my macbook on an external USB Drive. I've got rEFIt installed, but I want to know if there is a way of not installing grub

[11:30] <peregrine81> okay guys you are the experts heres a question. Will the ATI Mobility Xpress 200m ever be supported or will I have to use binaries that dont quiet -work-?
[11:30] <idigital> crimsum what the command was $ snd-cmi8330 correct but i recived bash: snd-cmi8330: command not found
[11:30] <johns^> select .... to user@localhost identified by 'password'
[11:30] <AngryElf> the "root		(hd0,0)" in menu.lst -- that refers to (hd<hard disk number>,<partition number>)  yes?
[11:30] <mike1980> johns: ok thanks
[11:30] <leny> brucedes: You can use the Alternate install CD to install grub to a place other than the MBR, i.e. your Linux partitiion. Would that do?
[11:31] <brucedes> It should do, yes
[11:31] <stefg> AngryElf: yes... but minus 1
[11:31] <kane77> i have ubuntu installed on a disk partition. on the same disk there's a windows partition (fat32). How can I decrease the Fat32 size and increase my linux partition???
[11:31] <brucedes> I considered doing it leny

[11:31] <AngryElf> cool
[11:32] <kane77> david___, will I lose my data on the fat32 partition??
[11:32] <peregrine81> nothing?
[11:32] <david___> no
[11:32] <AngryElf> is there any reason I can't take a HD from another box that is strictly XP and throw it in my box as slave and then set up grub with (hd1,0) ???
[11:32] <michaelmacleod> Does anyone here know why Ubuntu might be making my 2nd ethernet card oscillate between eth1 and eth2 when the system reboots? It's causing my PPPoE connection a lot of grief.
[11:32] <brucedes> Also, how do I connect to my wireless network? I put the SSID and WEP password in the network manager, but it doesn't work (In OS X now)
[11:32] <tarzeau> michaelmacleod: it's a linux kernel thing
[11:32] <mike1980> johns: still didn't work
[11:33] <tarzeau> michaelmacleod: i've got the same on a ultra5
[11:33] <cafuego_> michaelmacleod: /etc/iftab is a way to make it not do that
[11:33] <sorush20> have the ubuntu servers for the packages slowed down?
[11:33] <idigital> crimsum what the command was $ snd-cmi8330 correct but i recived bash: snd-cmi8330: command not found
[11:33] <michaelmacleod> tarzeau: It's a PowerMacG4, if that makes a difference.
[11:33] <_Staz> Hi, whats the correct way to switch users in gnome terminal.
[11:33] <tarzeau> michaelmacleod: no idea, mine's a sparc
[11:33] <Orangekid13> anyone know how to set up the resolution for widescreen? i've got a 1440x900 that looks retarded cause it's being forced to 1024x768
[11:33] <stefg> AngryElf: The problem is taht the bios will only look for the /first/ harddisk to find a MBR...

[11:34] <tarzeau> cafuego_: like quad cards on sparc do that by default
[11:34] <bimberi> _Staz: 'sudo su - anotheruser' is my method
[11:34] <AngryElf> stefg, which is fine -- i'm going to include the XP install in GRUB so I can select it....right?
[11:34] <cafuego_> tarzeau: ugh, broken hardware
[11:34] <tarzeau> cafuego_: no, it's not broken
[11:34] <tarzeau> cafuego_: it CAN be changed

[11:34] <mike1980> hi guys when i do this command mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES ON database1.* TO 'yourusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';  I get error ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'ON database1. *  TO 'mike'@'localhos
[11:34] <AngryElf> stefg, hence the (hd1,0) setup...
[11:34] <cafuego_> tarzeau: Then I suggest plugging 'em all in and using the bonding interface
[11:34] <we2by> edgy is very bugy here. I got a few weird issues :(
[11:34] <tarzeau> cafuego_: haha :) k
[11:35] <stefg> AngryElf: Grub is only called and seen by the bios if it's on hd_a_ ... hdb or hdc won't work if hda is present
[11:35] <Seveas> mike1980, #mysql may be more appropriate for such questions
[11:35] <mike1980> ok thanks
[11:35] <AngryElf> stefg, grub will be on hda -- XP will be on hdb
[11:35] <michaelmacleod> tarzeau: thanks, I think that should do the trick
[11:35] <ompaul> mike1980, put that in a pastebin before you do - it looks trunkcated
[11:35] <kane77> a second (stupid) question... how do I go about using the qparted? cuz as far as I know you have to unmount the disks you want to change
[11:35] <stefg> AngryElf: then you're good to go
[11:35] <AngryElf> sweet
[11:35] <AngryElf> thanx
[11:35] <leny> brucedes: Sorry stuck with WiFi myself.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows should help you in installing grub to a non-standard partition. Use (hd0,<linux partition no>) in the examples.

[11:41] <david_corrales> hi everyone. Anyone else getting grub's error #15 after the kernel upgrade?
[11:41] <ompaul> age6racer, log out and log back in if that fails call back
[11:41] <stefg> khaled83: that was just a cynical comment on the hardware-requiremnts of Windows Vista... We don't need 1 Gig of Ram just for the OS, without any app running
[11:41] <magic_ninja> anyone had cedega problems with ubuntu
[11:41] <stefg> Shaba1: no... what's the name of the .iso you downloaded?
[11:41] <age6racer> I tried that already. It saved my session settings   :/
[11:41] <Shaba1> Hold on I will check
[11:42] <ompaul> magic_ninja, those who do speak with cegeda, generally it is not supported here
[11:42] <khaled83> stefg, ah u right, vista requirements are crazy

[11:43] <wyld> carefully
[11:43] <Shadow_mil> how do I use it?
[11:43] <stefg> Shaba1: Then you have a Live-CD :-) burn it, boot it, love it :-)
[11:43] <david_corrales> wyld: not really. Everything -but- edgy is booting now
[11:43] <david_corrales> stupid upgrade
[11:43] <Shaba1> thanks
[11:43] <khaled83> guys, is it true that the next ubuntu release will mainly focus on solving laptop hardware problems???
[11:43] <Shadow_mil> tarzeau: I downloaded it
[11:43] <monkey050> Is there a way I can reboot without using the menu?
[11:43] <Shaba1> can you refer me to a place where I can then get instructions on how to install that on a HD?
[11:43] <david_corrales> khaled83: not really. It'll probably focus a lot on eye candy
[11:44] <Shadow_mil> monkey050: init 0
[11:44] <stefg> monkey050: sudo reboot in a terminal
[11:44] <monkey050> How do I get to it?
[11:44] <Shadow_mil> or init 6 (for a reboot)
[11:44] <monkey050> I can't get to the Applications menu
[11:44] <bruenig> sudo shutdown -r now
[11:44] <age6racer> OK I've fixed it. it was a process called xff-deskvier or something like that.
[11:44] <Shadow_mil> monkey050: terminal,
[11:44] <bimberi> Shaba1: boot the LiveCD and double-click on the Install icon on the Desktop

[11:44] <kincade> how do I login as root?
[11:44] <monkey050> Ok
[11:44] <governator> ok, i installed freespire then ubuntu... they are on sepeprate hds... how to access hd with freespire on it?
[11:44] <monkey050> Terminal won't open.
[11:44] <idigital> How do i find out whether your bios has PNP OS enabled?
[11:44] <idigital> I restarted
[11:45] <stefg> !root > kincade
[11:45] <monkey050> Is installing updates supposed to make things freeze?
[11:45] <khaled83> david_corrales, also a good point, but it dream of the day that i can run ubuntu on my toshiba laptop smoothly
[11:45] <idigital> and my computers go striaght to ubunutu loading...
[11:45] <kincade> do that at the login screen?

[11:47] <bimberi> !generic | jokoon
[11:47] <ubotu> jokoon: Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[11:47] <Music_Shuffle> jokoon, the other types were combined to reduce redundancy and save developer time I think.
[11:47] <monkey050> Ok, let met just reboot this thing.  I hope the updates didn't mess with things.
[11:47] <bashir> hey
[11:47] <monkey050> I'm on 2 computers right now.

[11:48] <crimsun_> idigital: I'm in a meeting atm, so I can't respond.
[11:48] <bashir> i just upgraded my kernel and it rewrote my grub menu.list !
[11:48] <bashir> it took off my windows parition menu
[11:48] <Uboon2> i'm on a chair, thats more comfortable

[11:48] <bashir> and now that i add it it isnt working
[11:48] <governator> then what should i do?
[11:48] <bashir> i added title		Windows 95/98/NT/2000

[11:48] <bashir> makeactive

[11:50] <defrex> can anyone help
[11:50] <defrex> ?
[11:50] <monkey050> Sorry, I meant age6racer.
[11:50] <bashir> can someone help me plz

[11:50] <monkey050> Now Ubuntu's loading slow.  I'll be right back.
[11:50] <ubotu> bashir: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:50] <bashir> i did
[11:50] <stefg> jokoon: you won't gain anything... generic means that the old separation of 586/686/k7 is now unified into a self optimizing kernel, which works on all architectures
[11:50] <prOMiNd> LjL: here ? :)
[11:50] <bashir> when i updated the kernel it rewrote my menu.list
[11:50] <Music_Shuffle> Just keeeeeeeeedding.  I knew that. ;p
[11:51] <bashir> it took off my windows parition entry
[11:51] <bashir> i tried entering title		Windows 95/98/NT/2000
[11:51] <bashir> root		(hd0,4)

[11:51] <prOMiNd> ubotu, tell about prOMiNd xine
[11:51] <bashir> but it comes up error 12 invalid device
[11:51] <bashir> my partition is hda5
[11:51] <bashir> so (hd0,4) should be right
[11:51] <prOMiNd> ubotu, about prOMiNd xine
[11:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about about prOMiNd xine - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:51] <stefg> !xine > prOMiNd

[11:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wake up dude - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[11:53] <ubotu> kincade: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:53] <age6racer> monkey050: I could do with a way to view wireless networks and try connecting to them.
[11:53] <jokoon> Anyhow, is there some utility or command to make a clean menu.lst ?
[11:54] <age6racer> I knwo there are two where I am (which I have acces to)
[11:54] <prOMiNd> ANY CAN HELP ME ?
[11:54] <WizCraker>  do I just run mysqladmin shutdown then run mysqld_safe & to start it again?  I changed the my.cnf file and trying to figure out the correct way for the restart
[11:54] <prOMiNd> Package xine-ui is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[11:54] <prOMiNd> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[11:54] <prOMiNd> is only available from another source
[11:54] <prOMiNd> E: Package xine-ui has no installation candidate
[11:54] <monkey050> I'm trying to think - my 6.10 is on a black screen with no backlight.  :?
[11:54] <bashir> anyone know what is wrong?
[11:54] <Music_Shuffle> !caps | prOMiNd
[11:54] <ubotu> prOMiNd: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[11:54] <monkey050> There was something I did with enabling it somehow.
[11:54] <monkey050> I remember.
[11:55] <dcordes> can someone take a look at my broadcom interface? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37061/
[11:55] <monkey050> I remember visually though so I need to get mine to work to show you.
[11:55] <defrex> Everything was running fine until the power to my house went out while I was at work. Whether it had to do with the power or not, I don't know, but now when I'm half way through loading gnome my screen goes multi-colour, then tosses me back to the sign-in screen. Is there anyone who can give me a hand?
[11:55] <un_operateur1> prOMiNd, are you sure you have the multiverse repo added to sources.list ??
[11:55] <age6racer> yeah in 'networking' you can choose to "enable" it, but it doesnt stay enabled
[11:55] <monkey050> Ok hold on.  My computer won't load Ubuntu now that i upgraded things.
[11:55] <monkey050> LOL.
[11:55] <monkey050> Nevermind, the screen went black for some reason.
[11:55] <monkey050> Pushing buttons always helps on black screen!
[11:55] <age6racer> lol
[11:55] <stefg> defrex: are you sure that the power outage didN#t send a voltage spike to your box that damaged the hardware?
[11:55] <age6racer> always
[11:56] <monkey050> Now I can log in.  Hold on and I'll get in the IRC on my other system.
[11:56] <prOMiNd> boys, please help me ...
[11:56] <prOMiNd> i can't install
[11:56] <prOMiNd> xine extra codecs ..
[11:56] <prOMiNd> i miss the packages ....
[11:56] <defrex> stefg: I hope not... but I doubt it. I'm running a live cd right now. I guess it could have hurt the hard drive...
[11:56] <un_operateur1> prOMiNd, http://rpm.rutgers.edu/repository/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/x/xine-extracodecs/
[11:57] <dcordes> p
[11:57] <age6racer> monkey050: Something is definately not right, cos it takes ages to activate the eth1 connection. As though it has just timed out.
[11:57] <n2diy> Mondo is telling me it "can't format a boot disk. Is your distro broken?" I emailed the error log to the developers, and I'm waiting to hear back from them.
[11:57] <monkey050> Hold on.
[11:57] <monkey050> I have the same card as you and it doesn't use ETH1 at all.
[11:57] <age6racer> oh...ok
[11:58] <prOMiNd> lol un_operateur1

[11:58] <justin4thirty> Hello! I have windows on hda1, linux on hdb1, and a fat32 filesystem on hdb2, but I can't read the fat32 partiton when I boot into windows. Does anyone know why?
[11:58] <stefg> defrex: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg will let you reconfigure your xorg.conf. But check, there might be locked files on the box, which need to be removed after the hard shutdown to get it up again
[11:58] <monkey050> Can someone help me so I can help age6racer?  lol
[11:58] <un_operateur1> prOMiNd, I asked you if you had the muliverse repo added to sources.list ..
[11:58] <un_operateur1> but you didnt see that post
[11:58] <Orangekid13> try putting sudo before the command?
[11:58] <treitter> does anyone know how (at least in recent versions of Ubuntu) tar knows to not autocomplete "tar -jxvf foo.tar<tab>" for foo.tar.gz (since it's seeing the -j flag passed to tar isn't applicable for foo.tar.gz)?
[11:58] <Orangekid13> oops
[11:58] <Orangekid13> monkey050: try putting sudo before the command
[11:59] <age6racer> ha, thanks for this monkey050
