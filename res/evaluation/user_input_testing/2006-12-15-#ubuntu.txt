[12:01] <monkey050> age6racer: That should bring up Network Settings
[12:01] <monkey050> You have to click the Wireless Connection and go to Properties.
[12:01] <age6racer> yup
[12:01] <monkey050> Then check Enable this connection
[12:01] <usr_rob> Do you need to defrag ext3 filesystem ?
[12:02] <monkey050> Then you'll need to enter your SSID.
[12:02] <Himura> usr_rob, nop
[12:02] <stefg> jokoon: i don't know quake, sorry . Try to search the wine/cedega forums. All I know is taht software emulation of 3D accel is of course too slow for games
[12:02] <age6racer> what is an SSID?
[12:02] <monkey050> The ID of your wireless router.
[12:02] <age6racer> like a workgroup name?
[12:02] <monkey050> No.
[12:02] <usr_rob> Himura: Okey, i've read it somewhere, just needed a confirm :) thx
[12:03] <|PaRaBoLa|> hello good night
[12:03] <|PaRaBoLa|> ..or day
[12:03] <age6racer> is there some way to find out the name of the router?
[12:03] <jokoon> stefg I'm not talking about an emulated game : quake 3 runs quite nicely in linux
[12:03] <Himura> usr_rob, http://geekblog.oneandoneis2.org/index.php/2006/08/17/why_doesn_t_linux_need_defragmenting
[12:03] <monkey050> If you have a windows computer you can just check the Wireless Connection for it.
[12:03] <monkey050> Yes
[12:03] <monkey050> Do you have access to a windows computer?
[12:03] <monkey050> You can find it on there.
[12:03] <vlt> age6racer, When card is finally running you can do a `iwlist scan`
[12:03] <usr_rob> Himura: Thx alot! :)
[12:03] <cmacis> is there a way to search networks?
[12:03] <cmacis> wireless ones
[12:03] <monkey050> Right, vlt.

[12:04] <stefg> jokoon: i don't game (too much)... but maybe poke ubotu with !games and see if you can find info in the list
[12:04] <monkey050> Hey, I rebooted and my time saved.  Yay.

[12:13] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I still can't get bloody Rhythmbox to work.

[12:27] <corevette> i installed xgl, but now i decide to uninstall it.  so when i uninstall xgl, the xserver says taht GDM can't find XGL so i'm stuck running in recovery mode because xserver gives me errors that say i need xgl to start up
[12:27] <CarrionReek> So how's Edgy going guys?
[12:27] <vlt> age you haven' installed fw yet
[12:27] <stefg> Orangekid13: yes... the command parts
[12:27] <monkey050-Ubuntu> brb, gonna install flash and audacity
[12:27] <HDS_> Hi everybody.... have a prob. installed xgl, all nice and dandy but when it comes to launching it just gives me a mouse pointer and waits for about half a minute, gives the loading cursors and reverts back to the session login screen.... how can i make it work?
[12:27] <age6racer> ok well i'll upgrage to edgy and then come back tomorrow then (if it doesnt work straight off the bat that is)
[12:28] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Join the club!
[12:28] <vlt> age6racer, You could give installing fw a try
[12:28] <age6racer> night all! and thanks so muc for all the help vlt & monkey050
[12:28] <type> what is the best way to move the /home folder to its own partition
[12:28] <age6racer> fw
[12:28] <age6racer> ?
[12:28] <thomasevensen> how can I revert back to the default theme by using the command line?
[12:28] <monkey050-Ubuntu> you're welcome
[12:28] <vlt> age6racer, firmware (I mentioned before)
[12:28] <Orangekid13> stefg: how long is the first part supposed to take? it's got a cursor on the line below... is it waiting for the root password?
[12:28] <shinda> hey, I'm having some permissions problems with curlftpfs anyone think they can help?
[12:28] <CarrionReek> So has it been none for dualbooting to completely destroy a computer?
[12:29] <corevette> i installed xgl, but now i decide to uninstall it.  so when i uninstall xgl, the xserver says taht GDM can't find XGL so i'm stuck running in recovery mode because xserver gives me errors that say i need xgl to start up
[12:29] <CarrionReek> "known"
[12:29] <age6racer> what does that entail?
[12:29] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I have the same card as him and didn't have to bother with "firmware"
[12:29] <type> what is the best way to move the /home folder to its own partition?
[12:29] <stefg> Orangekid13: not sure, put probably it's waiting for a password
[12:29] <vlt> monkey050-Ubuntu, You're on Edgy
[12:29] <CarrionReek> I was dual booting Dapper, and Windows.
[12:29] <monkey050-Ubuntu> We have the same Linksys card.
[12:29] <monkey050-Ubuntu> yeah
[12:29] <CarrionReek> And my computer went capoot.
[12:29] <monkey050-Ubuntu> 6.10.  ^)^
[12:29] <CarrionReek> kapoot
[12:29] <Orangekid13> i typed it and it showed up, hit enter and it's just got a cursor on the line below
[12:29] <age6racer> i'll upgrade to 6.10 and take it from there
[12:30] <stefg> kaputt is the right spelling in germen :-)
[12:30] <CarrionReek> But but it died.
[12:30] <Orangekid13> stefg: should i hit the reset button on my case?
[12:30] <age6racer> cheers guys/gals
[12:30] <stefg> Orangekid13: why?
[12:30] <CarrionReek> ANd I had to get a whole new computer, ironically I know it wasn't ubuntu that did it.
[12:30] <Orangekid13> stefg: it's not doing anything... there's no activity
[12:30] <type> what is the best way to move the /home folder to its own partition?
[12:31] <Music_Shuffle> Sometimes if you type in the wrong root pw it locks up like that.
[12:31] <CarrionReek> Is it hard to dualboot windows and ubuntu on one HD?
[12:31] <stefg> Orangekid13: ok then... to get back to a defined state it's probably good to reset
[12:31] <Music_Shuffle> CarrionReek, a lot of people do it.
=== type is now known as ubuntox
[12:31] <CarrionReek> But is it difficult to set up?
[12:31] <vlt> type: boot into init 2, mv all files from /home to another partition, add partition as /home to /etc/fstab
[12:31] <willskills> no
[12:31] <CarrionReek> I had 2 hd's before.
[12:32] <CarrionReek> Now I have one 160gb.
[12:32] <MrRio_> hey
[12:32] <MrRio_> Windows XP has taken over my MBR
[12:32] <ubuntox> is it possible to move the /home folder to its own partition?
[12:32] <pkh> how do you set services to automatically start (from commandline?)
[12:32] <MrRio_> I have the edgy live cd, how do I restore?
[12:32] <vlt> ubuntox, type: boot into init 2, mv all files from /home to another partition, add partition as /home to /etc/fstab
[12:32] <pkh> ubuntox, yes.
[12:32] <tptak> I need some help with the Alsa Driver for Pro SoundCard HowTo.
[12:32] <Orangekid13> stefg: so do i pick recovery mode from grub?
[12:33] <CarrionReek> So I take it it wouldn't be hard to do o o;;;;;;
[12:33] <spacepod> well thanks for the help johns^ and mralphabet
[12:33] <ubuntox> vlt, mv will more all files...hidden as well?
[12:33] <CarrionReek> I'm curious to see if my computer will even work right with the new computer under ubuntu.,
[12:33] <stefg> Orangekid13: no... just boot up normal and see what happens
[12:33] <spacepod> note.. you guys ROCK!
[12:33] <ndw> Hi all. I upgraded this morning and now my Thinkpad dies after seconds or minutes. The screen goes black and that's it, game over. Anyone else reporting issues with the stuff that was new (in Edgy) today?
[12:33] <Orangekid13> k
[12:33] <spacepod> power to ubuntu...
[12:33] <jrib> vlt: runlevel 2 is default in ubuntu
[12:33] <Orangekid13> well i have the ubuntu logo, that's good
[12:33] <CarrionReek> wait there's new edgy?
[12:33] <ndw> I've found an older kernel, so it's not the kernel it's something else.
[12:33] <monkey050-Ubuntu> How do I start the FLash 9 installer?
[12:34] <ndw> Uh. Well, apt-get update got new stuff this morning.
[12:34] <vlt> ubuntox, Yes, mv will move ALL files
[12:34] <ubuntox> vlt, what about telling ubuntu where the /home went
[12:34] <Music_Shuffle> Later spacepod.
[12:34] <spacepod> monkey you need to download it
[12:34] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I downloaded and extracted it to my home folder
[12:34] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I need to know how to start it from the terminal
[12:34] <vlt> ubuntox : add aline to /etc/fstab
[12:34] <Orangekid13> stefg: ok now i have a prompt
[12:34] <spacepod> ok now typ ./flash-installer
[12:34] <Orangekid13> lost what you said to type though
[12:34] <monkey050-Ubuntu> In terminal?
[12:34] <spacepod> in the console
[12:34] <spacepod> yea
[12:34] <ndw> Going all the way back to the edgy CD is a painful thought, so I'm hoping for a clue-by-four
[12:34] <stefg> monkey050-Ubuntu: don't use it! theres .debs available from third-party repos
[12:35] <spacepod> might be ./flashplayer-install
[12:35] <ubuntox> vlt, duh...i didn't realize it was that painless...i figured there had to be more steps
[12:35] <spacepod> ls the dir
[12:35] <stefg> Orangekid13: sudo -s
[12:35] <dope> what port does vncviewer use?
[12:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> bash: ./flash-installer: No such file or directory
[12:35] <CarrionReek> Have they fixed alot of the edgy problems yet?
[12:35] <kibab> konsole (in this ubuntu install) keeps wrapping my line about 20 characters prematurely and after the carriage return doesn't place a newline (starts overwriting the same line). Any ideas how I might fix it?
[12:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I got the same error for both
[12:35] <spacepod> it might be called flashplayer-install
[12:35] <spacepod> ls the dir in term
[12:35] <vlt> dope, The one you tel it to use.
[12:35] <HDS_> Hi, problem, tried installing XGL, successful install but crashes on session start..... any way i could find out what happens and how to fic it?
[12:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> What's that mean?
[12:35] <dope> what's the default
[12:36] <stefg> !xgl
[12:36] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - Help in #ubuntu-xgl - See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[12:36] <vlt> dope, default is 5900
[12:36] <tptak> ok, I haven't asked for anything ;) My fault ;] 
[12:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It's in my home folder
[12:36] <MrRio_> monkey050-Ubuntu:  for New flash 9, just read the readme, its one file, you need to copy into your plugin folder
[12:36] <dope> vlt: one more question.  how do i set system variables like $local
[12:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Plugin folder?
[12:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Where is that?
[12:36] <MrRio_> read the readme tyhat comes with flash 9
[12:36] <MrRio_> it says in there
[12:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I did read it.
[12:36] <vlt> dope, In a shell script?
[12:36] <stefg> monkey050-Ubuntu: why are you so keen on bypassing apt?
[12:37] <MrRio_> I should say something like copy the file to .mozilla/plugins
[12:37] <MrRio_> or something
[12:37] <thomasevensen> how can I revert back to the default theme by using the command line?
[12:37] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Perhaps because I didn't know about it?
[12:37] <dope> vlt, so i can access the variable from the console.  it's for an ip and it's easier to remember a name instead of an ip address
[12:37] <thomasevensen> or what file determines what theme is used?
[12:37] <stefg> thomasevensen: you can't... it's a gui for the gui settings
[12:37] <savvas> there is no more linux-image-k7 right?
[12:37] <gnomefreak> savvas: its generic
[12:37] <vlt> dope, FOO="123.13.123.123"
[12:37] <stefg> savvas: it's now -generic
[12:38] <gnomefreak> linux-image-generic
[12:38] <jrib> thomasevensen: gtk theme? metacity theme? icon theme?
[12:38] <savvas> gnomefreak: so the answer is no?
[12:38] <vlt> dope, 'vncviewer $FOO`
[12:38] <dope> ah ok
[12:38] <stefg> savvas: yes, no
[12:38] <vlt> dope, or better 'vncviewer ${FOO}`
[12:38] <dope> what about for ports?
[12:38] <gnomefreak> savvas: seperate kernel no but k7 modules are in -generic
[12:38] <thomasevensen> stefg: My machine froze when installing a new theme with gnome-art ... and after that I'm unable to get past login
[12:38] <spacepod> should be it in mozilla-firefox directory moneky
[12:38] <vlt> dope, ?
[12:38] <monkey050-Ubuntu> OK, it turns out i just redownloaded 7.  where do I find 9????
[12:38] <dope> like append a port onto the variable
[12:38] <Red-Sox> Hi, just wondering how I can determine what my CUPS printer's URL is...
[12:38] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: flash?
[12:39] <dope> vlt, like $foo:80
[12:39] <Orangekid13> stefg i did the sudo -s and now i have a root@[computer name]  prompt
[12:39] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: on edgy its in the backport repos
[12:39] <HDS_> Hi, problem, tried installing XGL, successful install but crashes on session start..... any way i could find out what happens and how to fic it?
[12:39] <vlt> dope, or better 'vncviewer ${FOO}:80`
[12:39] <monkey050-Ubuntu> ok
[12:39] <dope> ah ok
[12:39] <dope> thx a ton
[12:39] <gnomefreak> HDS_: see #ubuntu-xgl
[12:39] <dope> vlt, how do i delete the variable?
[12:39] <savvas> gnomefreak: hm.. if there was a k7, would it be faster? i never tried to switch to a k7 module kernel and compare before :\
[12:39] <vlt> dope, FOO=""
[12:39] <jrib> thomasevensen: it's stored in gconf keys.  /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_theme for the gtk theme and /apps/metacity/general/theme for the metacity theme.  You can use gconftool-2 to edit gconf keys
[12:39] <stefg> thomasevensen: if you just used drag and drop in the them manager you could rename ~/.icons and ~/.themes to take that away f
[12:40] <killermach> how do I keep ubuntu from deleting devices I make in /dev/ with mknod???
[12:40] <Orangekid13> stefg: do i type "apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-'uname -r' nvidia-glx && nvidia-glx-config enable" or do i still put sudo first?
[12:40] <vlt> dope, don't know if there's a better way#
[12:40] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Is there a proper name for "backport"? I only have universal and multiverse to chose
[12:40] <wyld> what does the java installer mean when it says: "The file should be owned by root.root and be copied to /tmp."?
[12:40] <dope> heh that'll work
[12:40] <dope> thx again
[12:40] <gnomefreak> savvas: generic is generic
[12:40] <stefg> Orangekid13: no, you're root now... now more sudo's necessary
[12:40] <sam75412> Howdy all. I am having all kinds of problems installing 6.10 . The display driver it installs with is buggy, and I can't get the ATI drivers installed without crashing my whole installation and having to start over. Any ideas?
[12:40] <spacepod> well till next time
[12:40] <savvas> ok thx
[12:40] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: does it say backports in the repo itself?
[12:40] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Uh... no.
[12:41] <monkey050-Ubuntu> universe, main, multiverse, restricted
[12:41] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: hold on let me get you the backports repo. are you using edgy?
[12:41] <stefg> Orangekid13: _no_ more sudo's necessary
[12:41] <wyld> how do i change ownerships of a file?
[12:41] <Orangekid13> stefg: "couldn't find package linux-restricted-modules-uname -r"
[12:41] <monkey050-Ubuntu> 6.10 baby!
[12:41] <jrib> wyld: chown
[12:41] <monkey050-Ubuntu> yep
[12:41] <gribelu> yo.. one thing.. could eveyone just grab a window, move it around, and tell if if the CPU utilization goes over 20%? :)
[12:41] <wyld> thanks

[12:42] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Wait so did i just have to checkmark the other 2 things???
[12:42] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I didn't know what a backport was
[12:42] <jrib> !support | sam75412
[12:42] <ubotu> sam75412: For your support options, see http://www.ubuntu.com/support
[12:42] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: do you see that line in /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:42] <monkey050-Ubuntu> um, hold on
[12:43] <Orangekid13> ok so it worked, mad a backup (like i would want to revert to that) and gave me the command to revert if it doesnt work
[12:43] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: if you see a check box for backports yes check it
[12:43] <MrRio_> sam75412: Canonical
[12:43] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It doesn't say backports, but it has the 4 kinds of things, 2 which are on by default.
[12:43] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Oh
[12:43] <MrRio_> http://www.canonical.com/support/webtolead
[12:43] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Then I just have to checkmark the things I guess.
[12:43] <CarrionReek> also why does the text install take 3 hours to do?
[12:43] <Red-Sox> Anyone here use CUPS?
[12:43] <sam75412> this is so frustrating

[12:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Where do I find it?
[12:48] <vlt> dope, Don't know very much abou that. Google for "export" ... or if it's onyl for IP addresses: list them in /etc/hosts
[12:48] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: take all the # away from any line that starts with deb
[12:48] <sam75412> ok, do you have AIM?
[12:48] <Stormx2> Got some issues setting up my wifi USB card. Check here: http://pastebin.ca/279352 Any help much appreciated. I really don't know what to do here.
[12:48] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: you have every repo but main commented out
[12:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> ok
[12:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> hold on
[12:49] <jrib> itsmabus: gnome-system-monitor is the package, do a google image search for "gnome system monitor".  The thing for logs is different.  Which did you mean?
[12:49] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: once you get rid of the # from all lines starting with deb save and close the file than sudo apt-get update
[12:49] <itsmabus> jrib: Oh, I meant the thing for logs, not the thing for monitoring processes.
[12:49] <Orangekid13> stefg: total noob here or i don't have it... i don't find anything that says nvidia
[12:49] <monkey050-Ubuntu> ok
[12:49] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: also at lines 17 and 18 add the word multiverse to the end
[12:49] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: never mind dont do that
[12:50] <xushi> hi all
[12:50] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I just did!

[12:50] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: leave 17 and 18 with the #
[12:50] <jrib> itsmabus: package gnome-utils contains /usr/bin/gnome-system-log (do a google image search for "gnome system log")
[12:50] <stefg> Orangekid13: sudo aptitude install nvidia-xconfig
[12:50] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: some reason you decided to put everything on one line instead of the way ubuntu does it
[12:50] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I didn't put anything anywhere
[12:50] <CarrionReek> w00ps.
[12:50] <CarrionReek> Oh well.
[12:50] <monkey050-Ubuntu> That's how it came
[12:51] <corevette> i installed xgl, but now i decide to uninstall it.  so when i uninstall xgl, the xserver says taht GDM can't find XGL so i'm stuck running in recovery mode because xserver gives me errors that say i need xgl to start up
[12:51] <stefg> Orangekid13: sudo aptitude install nvidia-settings
[12:51] <monkey050-Ubuntu> What do I have to put back where?
[12:51] <zamadara> so does anybody know how to set up the printer manager so that it doesn't "stop" the printer all the time? I'd like it to always be "started"
[12:51] <gnomefreak> monkey050-Ubuntu: leave 32 and 33 commented out also
[12:51] <xushi> You must get these 2 questions a thousand times, but, 1) Is the sole difference between kubuntu and ubuntu kde/gnome? 2) Should i base my choice between those two distros solely on that matter?
[12:51] <monkey050-Ubuntu> OK now is it safe?
[12:51] <stefg> xushi: yes and yes
[12:51] <Orangekid13> stefg: "score is -301" "accept this solution? Y/n/q/? "
[12:51] <itsmabus> jrib: thanks a ton
[12:52] <stefg> Orangekid13: yes
[12:52] <Orangekid13> stefg: it wants to remove nvidia-glx
[12:52] <xushi> stefg: they're both developed by the same group/organisation ?
[12:52] <monkey050-Ubuntu> can I sudo apt-get now?
[12:52] <xushi> thanks. I'm actually tempted to give it a try. You've convinced me =)
[12:52] <stefg> Orangekid13: oh... no, we don't want taht
[12:52] <Orangekid13> stefg: before i choose anything it says "remove the following packages: nvidia-glx"
[12:52] <Orangekid13> stefg: didn't think so
[12:52] <monkey050-Ubuntu> gnomefreak can I sudo apt-get now?

[01:07] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Now if it would work in Rhythmbox
[01:07] <justin_> Because Flash 9 beta.. is horrible, it works for a while and then it starts t crash and mash the system.
[01:07] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I don't know if it's beta
[01:07] <justin_> Well not the system.. just Firefox/Opera

[01:30] <ablyss> vanberge: another alternative would be vmware
[01:30] <vanberge> kitche, HDS43 ablyss ... tyvm.  :-*
[01:30] <ablyss> though you'd get better frame rate w/ wine
[01:30] <vanberge> ignore the kissy.. .meant :-)
[01:31] <stefg> monkey050-Ubuntu: even on gnome the best solution would be sudo aptitude remove --purge rhythmbox && sudo aptitude install amarok :-)
[01:31] <globe> quit
[01:31] <Shaba1> Its must be a bad image. The file size is only 8.53mb
[01:31] <monkey050-Ubuntu> But I want rhythmbox's functionality
[01:31] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I wanna be able to use the podcast stuff
[01:32] <stefg> amarok has it
[01:32] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I'll just sudo install amarok
[01:32] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I dont' want to get rid of rhythmbox
[01:32] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Bruenig, I'm signed in on 2 computers.  it's to differentiate where I am.
[01:33] <overridex> willskills: i use a usb headset with teamspeak...
[01:33] <limesoap> is nm-applet the utility for automatic network connection
[01:33] <limesoap> ?
[01:33] <HDS43> anyone with ATI in here running, or who ran XGL?!?!?!?!!?
[01:33] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Anyways, I don't want to worry about KDE stuff.
[01:33] <LjL> bimberi: ping, and can i pm you
[01:33] <un_operateur1> :thinks of the divider as nothing but a cosmetic blemish
[01:33] <bruenig> HDS43, #ubuntu-xgl
[01:34] <bimberi> hi LjL, sure
[01:34] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Is there a way to get rhythmbox to play my files?
[01:35] <kitche> monkey050-Ubuntu: what files?
[01:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Any of them!
[01:35] <un_operateur1> errm, yea, what files?
[01:35] <bruenig> your .doc files, no
[01:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> My MP3's, the Battlefield Modcast which I host
[01:35] <un_operateur1> lol
[01:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I'm not that stupid...
[01:35] <Alakazamz0r_> yeah you are
[01:35] <Alakazamz0r_> :P
[01:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> You wish.
[01:35] <kitche> monkey050-Ubuntu you need to install codecs
[01:35] <Alakazamz0r_> heheh
[01:35] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I installed them ALL
[01:35] <un_operateur1> rhythmbox ought to play all files that it finds codecs for
[01:36] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, you have been to the restricted formats page of the wiki?
[01:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> yYes
[01:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> That's where I got my codec install instructions from
[01:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I did it all except the DVD one because I Don't have a working CD drive on this comp
[01:36] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, rhythmbox should work then. You didn't use anything else, automatix maybe...
[01:36] <monkey050-Ubuntu> The fact is that it doesn, and I want to make it.
[01:37] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, what all did you install then
[01:37] <HDS43> anyone with ATI in here running, or who ran XGL?!?!?!?!!? And i have already been to #ubuntu-xgl.....nobody alive in there...
[01:37] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I went in the terminal and installed the 3 lines of codecs like it said
[01:37] <khaladan> hi
[01:37] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I followed exact instructions
[01:37] <monkey050-Ubuntu> the "quick way" thing.
[01:38] <khaladan> i downloaded ubuntu 6.06 server iso for amd64.  my cpu is actually a xeon.  will that work?  i thought so, but when i tried starting it, i got a message that said this wasn't amd64 hardware.
[01:38] <khaladan> it said "This is not an amd64 machine"
[01:38] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Did you accidentally install the AMD version, khaladan?
[01:38] <erUSUL> khaladan: there are 32bit xeons
[01:38] <khaladan> this is a new xeon, says it has x86-64
[01:39] <khaladan> i've not installed anything
=== Doodluv_ is now known as Dood_LESS
[01:39] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, what about gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
[01:39] <un_operateur1> so why did you get an AMD64 iso??
[01:39] <khaladan> BECAUSE THE AMD64 ISO SAYS IT WORKS WITH XEONS
[01:39] <jroes> ergh, fsck failed on my box -- what does one normally do when it asks whether to copy the backup to original or original to backup?
[01:39] <bruenig> khaladan, don't yell
[01:39] <khaladan> ok
[01:39] <bruenig> khaladan, hurts my ears
=== Dood_LESS is now known as Doodluv_
[01:39] <khaladan> right, sorry
[01:40] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I put them ALL, bruenig
[01:40] <erUSUL> un_operateur1: amd64 means that it works in x86_64 hard intel or amd
[01:40] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, do sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
[01:40] <monkey050-Ubuntu> The ugly, beastly, ogrely... all of them.  Whatever they were, I Did them all
[01:40] <khaladan> so anyway i am kind of confused
[01:40] <monkey050-Ubuntu> hokay
[01:40] <bruenig> khaladan, just go with the i386
[01:40] <monkey050-Ubuntu> i'll do it again
[01:40] <un_operateur1> well, the case that it fails means that a better alternative is to be used, no>
[01:40] <un_operateur1> ?
[01:40] <khaladan> drat
[01:40] <erUSUL> un_operateur1: no
[01:40] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Why.
[01:40] <khaladan> i hoped i could get a 64-bit version working
[01:41] <monkey050-Ubuntu> gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly is already the newest version.
[01:41] <khaladan> but i guess i386 is my only choice
[01:41] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I told you!
[01:41] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I'm not that stupid.  I installed ALL of them.
[01:41] <erUSUL> khaladan: maybe you need to pass noapic or acpi=off boot options in order to boot?
[01:41] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, well you certainly do know it all. Now tell me why exactly mp3's aren't playing
=== mcmahonm is now known as mcmahonm[A] 
[01:41] <willskills> overridex, - check your PM please :)
[01:41] <monkey050-Ubuntu> MP3s play in the movie player fine.
[01:42] <monkey050-Ubuntu> but rhythmbox doesn't play anything
[01:42] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It won't play imported files, it won't download podcasts
[01:42] <khaladan> erUSUL, thinik so? i can try that right now.
[01:42] <erUSUL> monkey050-Ubuntu: totem works? (no totem-xine i mean)
[01:42] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, was that the rhythmbox that came with it. I know some scripts will install a newer version...
[01:43] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Totem will play MP3s.
[01:43] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Rhythmbox is still stock.
[01:44] <monkey050-Ubuntu> is there some kind of sudo apt-get upgrade rhythmbox or something similar?
[01:44] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Am I on the right train of thought?
[01:44] <erUSUL> monkey050-Ubuntu: check gstreamer-properties to see if everything is all right
[01:44] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Is that a terminal cmd?
[01:44] <erUSUL> monkey050-Ubuntu: yes
[01:44] <khaladan> so i pressed F6 and added noapic to the end, but it said the same thing
[01:44] <aussieaubs> anyone here running ubuntu behind a proxy???
[01:44] <jroes> how do I mount an ext3 partition?
[01:44] <khaladan> now i'll try acpi=off
[01:44] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Ok, what do I do in the box?
[01:44] <catisonh> is there a program I can use to let me burn a huge directory to multiple DVDs?
[01:45] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It skipped some unavailable plugins
[01:45] <vanberge> monkey050-Ubuntu, did you try easyubuntu?  you're jsut trying to get mp3 playback??
[01:45] <monkey050-Ubuntu> those being artsdsing, pulsesink, sdlvideosink, v4lmjpegsrc, qcamsrc, esdmon, and pulsesrc
[01:45] <erUSUL> monkey050-Ubuntu: just check that it uses alsa as output
[01:46] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Output is autodetect right now
[01:46] <monkey050-Ubuntu> set it to ALSA?
[01:46] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, what is rhythmbox doing when you play mp3's
[01:46] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Nothing
[01:46] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It won't play it
[01:46] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I go to import file and it does Nada
[01:46] <CowEdgy> where can i download gnome themes?
[01:46] <kitche> CowEdgy: gnome-look.org
[01:46] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, have you tried right clicking on an mp3 and then opening with rhythmbox
[01:47] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I just tested with ALSA and i get the beep
[01:47] <CowEdgy> thanks kitche
[01:47] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Yes
[01:47] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I tried that too
[01:47] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, it skips it or gives an error or what
[01:47] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Just does nothing
[01:47] <khaladan> i added noapic and acpi=off to the end, but it said the same thing -- "This is not an amd64 machine. Please install the i386 distribution of Ubuntu."
[01:47] <monkey050-Ubuntu> The MP3s are on a flashdrive
[01:47] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, does it launch?
[01:47] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Hold on hold on, so many people helping at the same time
[01:47] <khaladan> argh. too bad i can't get this to work
[01:47] <un_operateur1> khaladan, you could do that and then upgrade to a xeon kernel later
[01:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Dang, now it plays.
[01:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It's playing the MP3 I told it to.
[01:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> This doesn't make much sense but OK...
[01:48] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, what was the problem then?
[01:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I have no idea!
[01:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> It just wouldn't do anything.
[01:48] <khaladan> un_operateur1, true--but arent't all the packages compiled for amd64 too?
[01:48] <bruenig> monkey050-Ubuntu, I am just that good of a helper
[01:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> lol
[01:48] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Now I'll try downloading a podcast.
[01:48] <kitche> maybe he forgot to close down and reopen it?
[01:49] <monkey050-Ubuntu> no, I closed it a million times
[01:49] <speedy> i lost sound after recent kernel update, how can i fix it?
[01:49] <un_operateur1> khaladan, not all, some -- I suppose synaptic/aptitude should take care of that and install them when you upgrade -- i'm guessing
[01:49] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Podcast downloads still fail.
[01:50] <overridex> is there anyway to allow windows to be on top of/cover up the top panel in gnome?
[01:51] <kitche> overridex: yes you have to change the properties of the top panel and uncheck always on top
[01:52] <arrenlex> !beryl > HDS43
[01:52] <will__> overridex, how did you get your usb headset working with ts?
[01:52] <overridex> kitche: when i right click on it and click properties, i don't see any mention of always on top - where is it?
[01:52] <arrenlex> !xgl > HDS43
[01:52] <overridex> will__: i basically just plugged it in, it became /dev/dsp2 (/dev/dsp is my soundcard, and /dev/dsp1 is my tvcard) and pointed teamspeak at dsp2
[01:52] <will__> overridex, Right click and Choose Properties..........
[01:52] <will__> ok
[01:53] <magic_ninja> cedega doesn't display buttons when i run the cedega setup wizard from a fresh install, has anyone found a fix for this
[01:53] <magic_ninja> !cedega } magic_ninja
[01:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cedega } magic_ninja - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:53] <overridex> all i see for the panel is orientation, size, expand, autohide, show hide buttons, arrows on hide buttons
[01:53] <CaBlGuY> anyone help me install googleearth from a .bin file..
[01:53] <overridex> does it need to be a different type of panel or something?
[01:54] <arrenlex> CaBlGuY: chmod +x <file.bin> && ./<file.bin>
[01:54] <clearscreen> chmod a+x then ./.........
[01:54] <clearscreen> too fast for me arrenlex :P
[01:54] <arfonzo> hi, is there a way i can make the "this-is-a-symlink" part of an icon smaller for ubuntu-desktop?
[01:54] <CaBlGuY> arrenlex:  K...
[01:54] <lazerbeak> hi there I just downloaded a driver for my wireless card how do I install it?
[01:54] <mike1980> How or where do I configure proftpd from please? GUI?
[01:54] <arfonzo> (or hide it altogether)
[01:55] <clearscreen> lazerbeak what kind of driver is it? module?
[01:55] <lazerbeak> it has two folders module and wpa_supplicant
[01:55] <CaBlGuY> arrenlex:  real quick, I have to be in the dir. folder yes, and not use Sudo..  is that right?
[01:55] <lazerbeak> its a wireless usb driver
[01:56] <lazerbeak> its a wifi usb adapter
[01:56] <arrenlex> CaBlGuY: The .bin file will tell you if you need to run it with sudo. And yes, same folder, of course.
[01:56] <clearscreen> CaBlGuY just depends on the bin file
[01:56] <CaBlGuY> k, gimme a sec..  bbiab
[01:57] <abo> I found the other day someone who used wine to run IE on linux, ... anyone knows about running msn messenger on linux?
[01:57] <zho> ???
[01:57] <clearscreen> try it abo :P
[01:57] <zho> use GAIM
[01:57] <will__> abo, use GAIM?
[01:57] <arrenlex> abo: I know about it, and it doesn't work well.
[01:57] <arrenlex> abo: Use GAIM. =P
[01:57] <clearscreen> or if you like the msn theme more: amsn
[01:57] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Hey you guys- you were just talking about Teamspeak - is there a Ubuntu version???
[01:58] <clearscreen> I believe there's a linux version of teamspeak
[01:58] <kitche> monkey050-Ubuntu: you can only get Teamspeak from their website
[01:58] <abo> arrenlex,will__, I'm using GAIM.. but i miss many of the nice annimations/video/audio features of msn
[01:58] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I know that, I'm a Server Admin.
[01:58] <zho> why i can't order from shipit for 6.10?
[01:58] <mike1980> can anyone help please where do I configure proftpd from please? GUI? I want to be able to upload pages remotely to var/www
[01:58] <arrenlex> abo: a) What animations are these? b) amsn supports video and audio conversations.
[01:58] <ski-worklap> anyone tried beryl on ubuntu?
[01:58] <will__> monkey050-Ubuntu, yes there is a linux version
[01:58] <clearscreen> abo: try amsn, and if that doesn't work out, I guess there is no choice then to go for wine + msn messenger
[01:59] <bruenig> ski-worklap, #ubuntu-xgl
[01:59] <kitche> zho: dapper is still being supported
[01:59] <khaladan> is there any way i can try to FORCE the ubuntu amd64 install to think that i have an amd64 compat. CPU?
[01:59] <clearscreen> <monkey050-Ubuntu> I know that, I'm a Server Admin. > then what's the problem?
[01:59] <zho> kitche: ic..
[01:59] <ski-worklap> bruenig, thanks!
[01:59] <bruenig> ski-worklap, your welcome!
[01:59] <lazerbeak> any ideas clearscreen?
[01:59] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I didn't know about a Linux version until now
[02:00] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I'm a WINDOWS PERSON.  *girly scream*
[02:00] <un_operateur1> sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority low proftpd  << might work
[02:00] <clearscreen> ah; lazerbeak is it a broadcom?
[02:00] <rever> Hi is there a systray applet for evolution?
[02:00] <magic_ninja> monkey then dual boot lol at least for the first 6 months

[02:00] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Lol
[02:00] <gilligan_> hi
[02:00] <abo> arrenlex, annimation in msn, I think they call them winks, and there is the audio messages (not the full audio message)... anyway I didn't know amsn had audio/video
[02:00] <magic_ninja> i did
[02:00] <magic_ninja> now i am full fledged windows free
[02:00] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Ubuntu is on my old crappy computer.
[02:00] <arrenlex> abo: Oh. Nothing supports winks as far as I know because they are Flash.
[02:00] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Windows ate itself and I wanted to use it somehow as a "toy backup"
[02:00] <magic_ninja> i got ubuntu on my new comp and this old laptop i aquired
[02:01] <CaBlGuY> arrenlex:  seems to be working..  at this point..  :p
[02:01] <gilligan_> does anyone here using mergedfb with a ATI radeon and two TFT monitors ? (not a laptop + tft ) ? I am having some problems and it would be nice to see a working xorg.conf file
[02:01] <lazerbeak> its a ralink RT2571W
[02:01] <monkey050-Ubuntu> But my new computer is a Windows thing.  I use it for podcasting and web editing and all other windows stuff.
[02:01] <arrenlex> CaBlGuY: Good to hear.
[02:01] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Like... Windows.
[02:01] <lazerbeak> I have the right driver
[02:01] <abo> clearscreen, arrenlex, amsn says there is a newer version, shouldn't the ubuntu update manager tell me about that and update my amsn?
[02:01] <lazerbeak> i just have clue how to install it
[02:01] <arrenlex> abo: Not if the newer version is not yet in the ubuntu repositories.
[02:01] <clearscreen> lazerbeak this shows you how to install ralink drivers; http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=296281
[02:01] <zho> magic_ninja: if you have good internet connection it's ok, but if you have bad connection windows is better hahaha...
[02:02] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Do Linux FFox download speeds differ from windows ones?  Maybe it's just the server I'm downloading from.
[02:02] <overridex> can i at least change how many pixels are shown when a panel is on auto-hide mode?
[02:02] <will__> overridex, read the gone documentation :)

[02:04] <ubotu> intrepidus: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:04] <zho> intrepidus: what happend to your grub?
[02:04] <intrepidus> Sorry.
[02:04] <intrepidus> It's not what happened, it's what I need to do: I need to reinstall grub.
[02:04] <arrenlex> intrepidus: What are you on right now?
[02:04] <clearscreen> don't think it only worked on KDE, arrenlex.. I used to use it on windows; so it's probably also compatible with gnome
[02:04] <intrepidus> I'm told if I reinstall grub with Ubuntu as the primary drive, and XP on another drive, it will recognize XP and I can dual boot.
[02:04] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Ubuntu at the moment.
[02:04] <arrenlex> clearscreen: kmeleon is a windows-only program.
[02:04] <khaladan> Hey, is there a kernel option to set the CPU type? I'm worried that Linux might be guessing incorrectly. it's supposed to be amd64 compatible.
[02:04] <intrepidus> I found the thread on how to reinstall grub, so that's not a huge problem.
[02:04] <clearscreen> arrenlex it is?
[02:04] <Gigaamd> i need help on installing libdvdcss2.  i am having a difficult time
[02:04] <arrenlex> clearscreen: Yes.
[02:04] <magic_ninja> cedega doesn't display buttons when i run the cedega setup wizard from a fresh install, has anyone found a fix for this
[02:05] <intrepidus> The larger problem is identifying which drive to reinstall grub on, because I don't understand grub ordering well. :/
[02:05] <arrenlex> intrepidus: How did you get into ubuntu if you need to reinstall grub?
[02:05] <limesoap> how can I get network-manager to work on 6.10? I have installed network-manager and network-manager gnome and it still doesn't find my net connections?
[02:05] <monkey050-Ubuntu> Sudo installing now
[02:05] <zho> hd0,1 means hdd 1 partition 1
[02:05] <zho> it's that true?
[02:05] <intrepidus> arrenlex: As I said above, I need to reinstall grub to get a dual boot.
[02:05] <arrenlex> zho: No. hdd1, partition 2.
[02:06] <zho> magic_ninja: any cedega package on ubuntu?
[02:06] <LjL> zho: no
[02:06] <intrepidus> But, how do I determine which hdd is 0, 1, 2, 3, etc? I have two SATA channels with a master/slave each. So, is channel 1 hard drive 0 and 1, and channel 2 hard drive 2 and 3?
[02:06] <magic_ninja> zho: what do you mean?
[02:06] <arrenlex> intrepidus: If grub is working why do you need to reinstall it? Just change the settings.
[02:06] <magic_ninja> v5.2
[02:06] <intrepidus> arrenlex: I've yet to find a thread detailing how to just change it...and I don't know grub well enough.
[02:06] <Gigaamd> i need help on installing libdvdcss2.  i am having a difficult time
[02:06] <un_operateur1> why change something that ain' broke
[02:06] <un_operateur1> ?
[02:07] <arrenlex> intrepidus: sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:07] <intrepidus> Because it is broke.
[02:07] <un_operateur1> whats broken?
[02:07] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Add an entry like this: http://arrenlex.diff.be/win
[02:07] <foo> I just stuck my new hard drives in a new system that has a different motherboard and what not. The drive is on /dev/hdb instead of /dev/hda like it was.. so I edited /etc/fstab to what it should be. Anything else I need to do? Still looks like I'm having some issues
[02:07] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Where (hd0,0) is the location of your windows partition: (hd0,0) = windows on first hard drive, first partition.
[02:08] <limesoap> I have followed everything at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[02:08] <CaBlGuY> ok, out..
[02:08] <CaBlGuY> thanks arrenlex o/
[02:08] <foo> Actually, Ubuntu starts up, but hangs on "Loading essential drivers." Bah
[02:08] <arrenlex> intrepidus: If you've forgotten, you can use sudo fdisk -l to list all your partitions.
[02:08] <magic_ninja> zho: i tried cedega 5.2
[02:08] <limesoap> it does detect the wired connection and connects
[02:08] <limesoap> but not the wireless
[02:09] <zho> magic_ninja: ic...
[02:09] <MakotoOgawa> http://pastebin.ca/279450  <--- can anyone explain that dmesg to me
[02:09] <Gigaamd> i need help on installing libdvdcss2.  i am having a difficult time.  It shows errors problems
[02:09] <intrepidus> arrenlex: It doesn't list the drive if I do fdisk -l, though.
[02:09] <intrepidus> arrenlex: I'm blind.
[02:09] <arrenlex> intrepidus: sudo fdisk -l ?
[02:10] <arrenlex> intrepidus: ... for real?
[02:10] <precious> hello
[02:10] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Sorry, I couldn't read. It's there.
[02:10] <astronouth7303> (I did this before, but that was awhile ago) sound isn't working at all. all the appropriate levels seem to be up, nothing muted, hardware seems ok. But I can't hear a thing. How do I track it down and fix it?
[02:10] <arrenlex> intrepidus: ...oh. o_o
[02:10] <precious> its ok
[02:10] <vanberge> if i'm runing 6.06 on a laptop (not this computer)  can i upgrade it to 6.10 with apt?  i thought there was an upgrade dist or dist upgrade... something like that
[02:10] <intrepidus> arrenlex: So it tells me it's /dev/sdb...does that mean it's hd(1,0)?
[02:10] <kitche> vanberge: update-manager -c
[02:10] <precious> hello
[02:11] <arrenlex> intrepidus: /dev/sdb is an entire hard drive, not a partition. I'm pretty sure your windows is supposed to be on a partition.
[02:11] <vanberge> kitche, you always help me!  :-)   thanks!!
[02:11] <intrepidus> Er, sorry, yes, meant that-/dev/sdb1.
[02:11] <astronouth7303> crimsun_ had said to post the results from amixer
[02:11] <green_earz> Gigaamd: paste the error that http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/  and put the link back here
[02:11] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Yep, (hd1,0)
[02:11] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Ok, I'll give it a shot then. Thank you, a ton!
[02:11] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Just change that file, save it, and reboot. You don't have to reinstall anything; grub reads options from there every time.
[02:11] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Good luck.
[02:12] <lazerbeak> clearscreen thanks
[02:12] <precious> what
[02:12] <clearscreen> yw lazerbeak
[02:12] <precious> i dnt understand
[02:13] <lazerbeak> its very compicated
[02:14] <precious> i dnt understand
[02:14] <arrenlex> precious: I don't think anyone even said anything to you. What don't you understand?
=== arrenlex is now known as Elron1
=== Elron1 is now known as arrenlex
[02:15] <Arwen> question - if I install the new kernel version from the security repository, will I have to rebuild my kernel modules or is this version backwards compatible?
=== MakotoOgawa is now known as Drako60
[02:16] <eltech> hey guys .. something different in the partitionin scheme in the new 6.10?
[02:16] <precious> it so very dificult the that u used
[02:16] <green_earz> astronouth7303: check to see what the sound card driver name should be at >  http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/   then use the cammand : lsmod | grep snd      to see if it installed
[02:16] <Arwen> eltech, not reallky
[02:16] <eltech> seems like there is no more slider to make it easier to setup dual boot systes
[02:16] <precious> hi
[02:16] <Drako60> http://pastebin.ca/279450  <--- can anyone explain that dmesg to me
[02:17] <precious> hi
[02:17] <LjL> precious: questions? ask.
[02:18] <eltech> should i have partitioned the hard drive for ubuntu or could it have done it itslef?
[02:18] <eltech> itself*
[02:18] <precious> what is ur name pls
[02:18] <arrenlex> eltech: The installer will take care of it.
[02:18] <LjL> eltech: it can do it by itself
[02:18] <precious> f
[02:18] <eltech> ok
[02:18] <precious> u
[02:18] <LjL> precious: ?
[02:18] <arrenlex> ...?
[02:18] <eltech> so ill just re-merge the partition
[02:18] <eltech> and let ubuntu do it
[02:18] <intrepidus> Oy.
[02:18] <precious> what
[02:18] <Arwen> eltech, not reallky
[02:19] <precious> balo dry
[02:19] <Arwen> eltech, not reallky
[02:19] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Problems?
[02:19] <intrepidus> Well, that didn't go so hot. When I chose XP, it just sat there blinking a single _ at me.
[02:19] <precious> no
[02:19] <LjL> precious, are you just churning words randomly...?
[02:19] <m12> how do I remove the "trash" and "computer" icons from the desktop?
[02:19] <Arwen> question - if I install the new kernel version from the security repository, will I have to rebuild my kernel modules or is this version backwards compatible?
[02:19] <intrepidus> arrenlex: copy-pasted the code from that link and changed the drive to the hd(1,0) to reflect my system...just a blinknig line.
[02:19] <arrenlex> precious: The cheese moon will emancipate cold water kittens by daylight.
[02:19] <Arwen> m12, run gconf-editor and go to apps>nautilus and uncheck the "show foo icon" box
[02:20] <bhudda> We are all but travelers in time and space
[02:20] <LjL> Arwen, what i know is that it isn't just a security patch from Ubuntu, but actually a new kernel revision from upstream... 2.6.17.1
[02:20] <precious> what do u mean by that
[02:20] <arrenlex> precious: Absolutely nothing. Do you have a question to ask?
[02:20] <Arwen> LjL, eww.... rebuild....
[02:20] <Gigaamd> Ok here is the link you request.  Please help
[02:20] <Gigaamd> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37091/
[02:20] <precious> no
[02:20] <eltech> Arwen is my thinking right and the preparing was a bad move if i didnt need any advance mount point options?
[02:20] <eviltwin> ok, so I get how to setup my theme, the gdm theme and the splash screen image
[02:21] <eviltwin> but I don't get howto change the background colour when the splash screen is there
[02:21] <arrenlex> Gigaamd: You need to install libdvdcss2 first.
[02:21] <Arwen> eltech, sorry, those messages to you were mistakes - my scrollback history was wiped at your comment, lol - ignore it
[02:21] <eviltwin> or how to change the default theme for new users
[02:21] <Gigaamd> where?  i download the deb package
[02:21] <arrenlex> intrepidus: ...you're sure the partition is correct?
[02:21] <Arwen> LjL, anway, update-manager says it's still 2.6.17-10
[02:21] <eltech> oh
[02:21] <eltech> so
[02:21] <datil> hi
[02:21] <eltech> something different in the partitionin scheme in the new 6.10?
[02:22] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Oh! I think I know... a second...
[02:22] <green_earz> Gigaamd:   sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2
[02:22] <eltech> seems like there is no more slider to make it easier to setup dual boot systems
[02:22] <intrepidus> arrenlex: fdisk -l says the boot (*) is on /dev/sdb1, format NTFS...has to be, I think.
[02:22] <Arwen> green_earz, doesn't work that way
[02:22] <m12> Arwen:  I don't see a "show foo icon"  box anywhere.
[02:22] <datil> is the Marvell Yukon ethernet controller supported in 6.10? (asus p5b motherboard)
[02:22] <eltech> should i have partitioned the hard drive for ubuntu or could it have done it itself
[02:22] <intrepidus> datil: Yep, mine works. :)
[02:22] <LjL> Arwen: apt-cache policy says Installed: 2.6.17.1-10.34
[02:22] <datil> intrepidus, what board do you have?
[02:22] <intrepidus> datil: I have it on a P5GDC, no problems at all.
[02:22] <arrenlex> intrepidus: try adding "makeactive" between the savedefault and chainloader lines.
[02:22] <eltech> is my thinking right and the preparing was a bad move if i didnt need any advance mount point options?
[02:22] <Arwen> m12, terminal > gconf-editor > apps > nautilus > desktop
[02:22] <Arwen> sorry
[02:22] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Ok, I'll try
[02:22] <LjL> Arwen: the package *name* still ends with 2.6.17-10, yes, but i guess that doesn't really mean much
[02:22] <eltech> and let ubuntu resize and create the partitions?
[02:23] <datil> intrepidus, i have a p5b deluxe which has two Marvell ethernet controllers.. i was using 6.10 livecd and apparently it detected one of the two but i couldn't connect to internet
[02:23] <eviltwin> datil, my marvel yukon nic working with 6.10 (asus p5n32-sli, I think)
[02:23] <Arwen> LjL, I see.... damn it, it replaces the old kernel, I can't go back if I get a build error
[02:23] <Gigaamd> green_earz: it says the package is no longer available.
[02:23] <green_earz> Arwen: the error out put say it need it, from the paste > libdvdcss2-deb depends on libdvdcss2;
[02:23] <astronouth7303> the amixer output is http://www.astro73.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=1
[02:23] <schisms> Do you people think that ubuntu is a good host for linux from scratch?
[02:24] <datil> eviltwin, ifconfig shows one as detected but then through gnome setting the ip, gateway and dns correctly it does nothing
[02:24] <ianp> you know what's one of the most annoying parts of ubuntu's UI?
[02:24] <schisms> Well?
[02:24] <m12> Arwen:  no boxes under Desktop either for me.  none that say that for any of the branches under nautilus
[02:24] <ianp> grabbing the bottom right corner of a window
[02:24] <LjL> Arwen: i suppose you're right... and i've never tried downgrading a kernel
[02:24] <eviltwin> datil, I haven't actually tested whether it WORKED ;)
[02:24] <Arwen> green_earz, sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
[02:24] <drkm> is there anyway I can get Gnome to confirm a deletion when I press del?
[02:24] <ianp> i cant just grab the area, i have to move the mouse exactly on the corner
[02:24] <astronouth7303> crimsun_: you get that?
[02:24] <eviltwin> I only knew it was detected... so I guess I dunno
[02:24] <schisms> Do you people think that ubuntu is a good host for linux from scratch?
[02:24] <monkey050-Ubuntu> OK now I need some Teamspeak help
[02:24] <datil> eviltwin, heh..
[02:24] <green_earz> Arwen: thanks for that
[02:24] <Arwen> LjL, I remember that it was possible to have multiple vmlinux's on previous ubuntus...
[02:25] <arrenlex> schisms: Could you rephrase your question please? No comprendo.
[02:25] <eviltwin> I would test it, but I use wireless while I have my desktop at home
[02:25] <eviltwin> :)
[02:25] <schisms> Sorry.
[02:25] <monkey050-Ubuntu> The Linux version has me set to automatically muted headphones and microphone and I think i might have to change the audio device.  I need to know what to change.
[02:25] <Arwen> LjL, techinally, you just remove the vmlinux and add an older one
[02:25] <green_earz> Gigaamd: Arwen say :   sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
[02:25] <schisms> I'm building an lfs system and I was wondering whether or not ubuntu has the right stuff.
[02:25] <Arwen> green_earz, yes - it'll fetch a deb and install it
[02:25] <schisms> An lfs system is a linux from scratch system.
[02:25] <Gigaamd> yes i do thanks arwen!!!!
[02:25] <LjL> Arwen, i think it's still quite possible to have multiple kernels. but one thing is having two different *packages* - those should be handled nicely, get their Grub entries each, etc.... but in this case, it's the same package, just a new package version. that's different
[02:26] <schisms> Basically, you create your own distro
[02:26] <schisms> It's good practice.
[02:26] <green_earz> Arwen: nice one
[02:26] <Arwen> LjL, yea - don't like that.... should be multiple packages...
[02:26] <Arwen> some of us have to compile source drivers...
[02:26] <schisms> What do you think arrenlex?
[02:27] <arrenlex> schisms: Not familiar with lfs. Sorry.
[02:27] <LjL> Arwen: well, one could assume that same package version = binary module compatibility. if it were my computer, honestly, i'd probably just try it... but then many things i do on my computer aren't quite recommendable ;-)
[02:28] <Arwen> LjL, true - heck, this new one might even fix compatibility with a stable version of my drivers...
[02:28] <Arwen> though I doubt it
[02:28] <intrepidus> arrenlex: No change. Do I need the kernel and initd lines or somethnig?
[02:29] <arrenlex> intrepidus: As awesome as it would be to have a Linux kernel running under Windows.... no, you don't. =P
[02:29] <Mando> ok i have a problem.. my graphics card used to average around 2000 fps when i used glxgears to check
[02:29] <schisms> Don't worry about it.
[02:29] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Have you ever run Windows from a slave drive before? I don't know if it's capable. I know for a fact you can't install Windows to a logical partition...
[02:29] <Mando> now that ive installed the fglrx driver.. it averages 8000 fps on xgl, and only 300 on the normal session!
[02:29] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Heh. Well to make sure I'm not missing something simple, maybe something's not lined up right, so here's the order (if it matters): Ubuntu first, followed by XP, then Ubuntu (recovery mode), and finally memtest86. Is that all good and in order?
[02:29] <schisms> Are there any good software dev tools that go smoothly with ubuntu?
[02:29] <Arwen> 'nother question - is it possible to switch from ubuntu to kubuntu (i.e., install kubuntu-desktop and remove all the ubuntu-desktop related packages)?
[02:30] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Actually, no. I thought it was on the other SATA master, but apparently not. Think that's my issue?
[02:30] <Arwen> schisms, gedit
[02:30] <schisms> Yes Arwen
[02:30] <LjL> Arwen: it's possible to do the first part, it's harder to do the second part
[02:30] <Mando> anyone?
[02:30] <Arwen> LjL, because of configuration files?
[02:30] <slipttees> hello
[02:30] <LjL> Arwen: installing kubuntu-desktop is a matter of, well, installing it. but you can't just say "now remove all ubuntu-desktop related packages" to APT
[02:30] <schisms> You could download the kde enviroment
[02:30] <arrenlex> intrepidus: It's a random guess based on almost unrelated snippets of information I've heard a long time. Please take them as such.
[02:30] <eltech> anyone before i give this a try and waste time
[02:30] <abo> another question, does wine support other architectures then x86?
[02:30] <LjL> Arwen: no, just because uninstalling ubuntu-desktop itself won't uninstall anything else
[02:31] <Arwen> LjL, could I search for dependant backages on ubuntu-desktop and purge those?
[02:31] <slipttees> please, somebody repost this bug for me:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37094/
[02:31] <arrenlex> a long time *ago
[02:31] <eltech> should i not partition the hard drive and let ubuntu do so?
[02:31] <slipttees> :)
[02:31] <Mando> please anyone help.. graphics are very important to me.. i need to get my fps rate atleast back to 2000 fps
[02:31] <Arwen> LjL, or will that screw me over later?
[02:31] <intrepidus> arrenlex: I'll give it a shot. Be back in a cable switch :)
[02:31] <schisms> arwen
[02:31] <Mando> where are all the helpful people of the ubuntu community
[02:31] <LjL> Arwen: that's possible, it's a lot of packages though. what i usually do is remove libgnome, that way most gnome-related stuff goes away...
[02:31] <LjL> !offline | Arwen
[02:31] <ubotu> Arwen: If you need to download Ubuntu packages using another machine or OS, http://apt.byethost14.com/ may help you with determining which dependencies to fetch
[02:31] <schisms> I recommend simply installing the KDE environment.
[02:31] <Arwen> LjL, ?
[02:31] <LjL> Arwen: also this might be of some help, but note it's experimental enough
[02:31] <schisms> And checking it out.
[02:32] <Arwen> schisms, I know - I want GNOME and it's stuff gone though
[02:32] <Arwen> its*
[02:32] <slipttees> PLEASE , somebody repost this bug for me:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37094/
[02:32] <schisms> I think you should just install kubuntu, you wouldn't have to go through all of the trouble.
[02:32] <drkm> is there anyway I can get Gnome to confirm a deletion when I press del?
[02:32] <schisms> good question.
[02:32] <arrenlex> Arwen: You want gnome gone? http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde
[02:32] <Arwen> schisms, low disk space, lol - I only reserved 8G for system
[02:33] <schisms> Ah
[02:33] <Arwen> arrenlex, hmm
[02:33] <schisms> What are you duel booting with?
[02:33] <Arwen> schisms, nothing - I just allocated the rest to /home
=== stoneey is now known as Stonez0r
[02:33] <Mando> please someone help me
[02:33] <LjL> Arwen: anyway, if you remove libgnome, not everything gnome-related is guaranteed to go away... but in practice, i think you should be good to go honestly
[02:34] <Arwen> LjL, alrighty
[02:34] <Arwen> say, what's with the lost+found folders on all the partitions?
[02:34] <LjL> !lost+found | Arwen
[02:34] <ubotu> Arwen: lost+found is where !fsck places any files it gleans from a corrupt filesystem.  These are files which had become unlinked from their parent directories.
[02:34] <Arwen> ah
[02:34] <Arwen> LjL, if I deleted it, would it pwn me later?
[02:34] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Well, no luck there - they're both already set as masters :P
[02:34] <LjL> Arwen: i wouldn't delete it
[02:35] <phrizer> How do i make an application the default application for a document?
[02:35] <arrenlex> intrepidus: I meant, the first hard drive. hd0.
[02:35] <Arwen> LjL, if I make a new one, would that fix it?
[02:35] <LjL> Arwen: you can delete the files it contains, if after checking them you see you don't care about them
[02:35] <intrepidus> arrenlex: I'm confused?
[02:35] <arrenlex> And gone, I see.
[02:35] <LjL> Arwen: i'm not sure. i think fsck will create one anyway next time it needs to. when i said "i wouldn't delete it", i just meant i wasn't entirely sure of the consequences... but they shouldn't be too bad i think
[02:35] <intrepidus> Oops.
[02:35] <arrenlex> ...and hi. xD
[02:36] <Arwen> ok
[02:36] <intrepidus> AIGLX was angry, it ate xchat./
[02:36] <Mando> i thought people are supposed to get help here :(
[02:36] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Again, I remind you that I have no idea what I'm babbling about.
[02:36] <cyber_brain_mfkg> hello! i need help! i tryed to uninstall rhitmic box and after i restarted X gnome is not as it used 2 be! i can't run synaptic(it says : wrong password) and panels do not work as they should :S
[02:36] <Arwen> btw - I lacked foresight and made my /home partition XFS - is there anything wrong with that?
[02:36] <arrenlex> intrepidus: That said, maybe windows doesn't like being on hd1. Maybe it likes hd0.
[02:36] <intrepidus> arrenlex: I've got less. So what's this about the hd(0)?
[02:36] <intrepidus> arrenlex: But won't that result in the Windows bootloader firing up first?
[02:36] <LjL> Mando: i can't speak for the rest of the people of course, but i have nvidia. hardly can help with ati issues
[02:36] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Or should I just rearrange the sequence?
[02:36] <cyber_brain_mfkg> what 2 do?
[02:37] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Whatever is in the MBR will run.
[02:37] <Arwen> cyber_brain_mfkg, 1. stop talking in txt. 2. what's rhitmic box?
[02:37] <arrenlex> intrepidus: Of the first drive... I think.
[02:37] <Mando> oh ok
[02:37] <LjL> Arwen: bad... it's a filesystems. some people like some filesystems, other people like other filesystems. i'm just staying with ext3 because it's known to be quite reliable
[02:37] <intrepidus> arrenlex: Guess I'll play some more then
[02:37] <arrenlex> intrepidus: so you would have to reinstall grub... I think... ...I really don't know what I'm talking about at this point. I'll stop talking before I do more harm than good.
[02:37] <arrenlex> Good luck. = /
[02:37] <LjL> if not exceptionally fast or feature-packed
[02:38] <cyber_brain_mfkg> *rythmbox
[02:38] <Arwen> lol - whatever, when it kills me, it'll have killed me
[02:38] <klees> what's the command to install/upgrade a *.deb package?
[02:38] <arrenlex> Arwen: You're discussing ReiserFS, aren't you.
[02:38] <Arwen> does anyone know how to change from octal permissions to access control lists?
[02:38] <Arwen> arrenlex, XFS
[02:38] <intrepidus> arrenlex: One last question: the tutorial for re-installing grub says to type root(hd0,0) and then "setup hd(0)"...did they mean "setup hd(0,0)" or is that right?
[02:38] <klees> i would like to upgrade the older version
[02:38] <LjL> arrenlex: XFS actually
[02:38] <arrenlex> Arwen: Oh. That's not ironic then.
[02:38] <monkey050-Ubuntu> I've got some work to do.  I'll be back later.  bye
[02:39] <Arwen> arrenlex, lol :-P
[02:39] <Arwen> say, has Hans Reiser been convicted yet?
[02:39] <monkey050-WinXP> Bye bye!
[02:39] <LjL> !offtopic | Arwen, sorry, got to give you this
[02:39] <ubotu> Arwen, sorry, got to give you this: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[02:39] <arrenlex> Arwen: He's pled not-guilty last I heard... but then I get all my news from his wikipedia entry.
[02:39] <Arwen> so - I'd really like ntfs-style access control lists instead of octal permissions, how can I do this?
[02:40] <cyber_brain_mfkg> Arwen: rhythmbox!
[02:40] <LjL> Arwen: that's supported on ext3 as well

[02:40] <Arwen> cyber_brain_mfkg, removing it shouldn't break anything - can you print ~/.xsession-errors to !pastebin ?
[02:40] <cyber_brain_mfkg> Arwen: i think i removed something that gnome use
[02:40] <Arwen> LjL, how?
[02:40] <Arwen> LjL, more details?
[02:40] <LjL> Arwen: blah, i meant acl of course... anyway, it would just have given you a package entry

[02:41] <ubotu> acl: Access control list utilities. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.2.39-1ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 42 kB, installed size 220 kB
[02:41] <LjL> Arwen, i have to dig the details myself. i just live with octal permissions (though, well, i don't use the octal notation usually :P)
[02:41] <Arwen> LjL, meh - for a couple folders I need multiple groups
[02:41] <cyber_brain_mfkg> Arwen: what?
[02:41] <LjL> Arwen: hold on a minute
[02:42] <Arwen> cyber_brain_mfkg, ~/.xsession-errors is a file, it has an error report - put it to !pastebin
[02:42] <drkm> my secondary hard-drive which I have mounted sounds like it is turning off after 5 minutes in inactivity.. how do I make it longer?
[02:42] <Arwen> drkm, is that setting in your bios?
[02:43] <drkm> Arwen: I don't think so. It wasn't doing this when I had windows installed..
[02:44] <LjL> Arwen: what you need are mostly the "setfacl" and "getfacl" commands, which are indeed in the "acl" package
[02:44] <cyber_brain_mfkg> Arwen: i can't find that file!
[02:44] <Arwen> LjL, more info? I don't just want to install stuff
[02:44] <eltech> anyone know a utility that can merge partitions?
[02:44] <Arwen> cyber_brain_mfkg, it's in your home folder, is hidden, and is called .xsession-errors
[02:44] <Gigaamd> QT can i believe eltech
[02:44] <Arwen> eltech, gparted.... but it's not worth it
[02:44] <eltech> Arwen gparted is great .. i used it to create the partition
[02:45] <LjL> Arwen: i have some more info, but... they're on slides in italian ;) that stuff just happened to be explained some weeks ago at uni. i didn't listen though
[02:45] <eltech> Gigaamd qtparted on a live cd like gparted?
[02:45] <Arwen> LjL, a gui tool would be nice, lol - I'm not very smart
[02:45] <LjL> Arwen: http://security.dico.unimi.it/sicurezza0607/stuff/02b_lab_sicurezza_18-10-2006.pdf - you can probably glean something from the examples

[02:54] <der_steppenwolf> hi
[02:55] <jorgelopez100> hello
[02:55] <der_steppenwolf> I use cvs to checkout a project, but it seems the file names of the project are encoded in iso8859-1. So, when I see the file names I see '?' characters. I can change the encoding to UTF-8 by using the command convmv. However, if I want to see the differences using diff with my files and the files in the CVS obviously they are different. Is there any other way to work more transparently?
[02:55] <cyber_brain_mfkg> drkm: and now desktop is strange,don't have icons,cant open synaptic(it says wrong password),keyboard is strange...

[02:56] <n0deal> ryanakca: sudo chmod 755 *
[02:56] <drkm> cyber_brain_mfkg: I'm not too sure as I can't tell what it's removed..
[02:56] <n0deal> ryanakca: in that directory
[02:57] <drkm> cyber_brain_mfkg: probably see if someone with a bit more experience than me can help you
[02:57] <ryanakca> n0deal: that makes all current / existing files 755, not the ones that will be created

[03:23] <[Ithaycu] > Is it possible to remove updates without using synaptic or from the command-line
[03:23] <agent> Jordan_U: but i bet its more powerful otherwise the big studios would not use it
[03:23] <MasterLexx> cinderella is the wrong one
[03:23] <bruenig> [Ithaycu] , what do you mean remove updates? Remove the update process or remove a particular update that you don't want to enact
[03:24] <[Ithaycu] > I ran synaptic yesterday and installed the updates
[03:24] <bruenig> by update process I mean updating in general

[03:31] <ShakaGoldSaint> hi, i'm having problems trying to install edgy, X fails to start, i've already tried safe video mode just like i did with dapper, that time it did the trick, i have a radeon x800 gto, any suggestions?, how can i make a text-mode install?
[03:32] <agent> MasterLexx: but yea, im sure it gives you some clues as to its capabilities ;)
[03:32] <lambo4jos> has anyone had problems with the binary installation package of the mysql-query-browser on ubuntu dapper.  It installs fine, but I think the binary is broken cause it shuts down when I try to edit tables.  anyone know how to fix this?
[03:32] <[Ithaycu] > Defend: the last thing in the Xorg log is FreeFontPath: FPE "/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/" refcounf is 2, should be 1; fixing.
[03:32] <xabbott> ShakaGoldSaint: you need the alternate cd
[03:32] <Defend> hmm
[03:32] <Defend> try reinstalling x maybe
[03:33] <[Ithaycu] > Defend: my problem with Xorg is related to perms
[03:33] <Defend> maybe some libs got moved/updates

[03:33] <Defend> hmm
[03:33] <ShakaGoldSaint> xabbott: what is that? :S
[03:33] <agent> lambo4jos: you may also try phpmyadmin -- mysql-query-broweser only lets you look at the query you create - phpmyadmin also has a query page that actually does something ;)

[03:34] <agent> lambo4jos: yes
[03:34] <xabbott> ShakaGoldSaint: it has a text installer, it is like Debian's etch install....pretty easy.
[03:35] <agent> lambo4jos: except blobs :)
[03:35] <lambo4jos> agent: is it 'sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin' ?

[03:42] <lambo4jos> agent: >	ruby on rails on an ubuntu desktop at home and running webrick is all i need.
[03:42] <agent> jevangelo: rm is as fast as you will get because rm does not even remove any files just "unlinks" them - if its taking a long time you picked the wrong filesystem :)
[03:42] <jevangelo> ah
[03:42] <agent> lambo4jos: so you want ruby + mysql, right?
[03:42] <lambo4jos> agent: yes and i already have that working, but would like a gui tool to administer mysql
[03:43] <shadwan> Hey there. Anyone know how to use DOSBox?
[03:43] <agent> jevangelo: there is no such thing as a real remove :) there is a wipe program that wipes your files/directories but that would take you days if you say rm takes hours
[03:43] <jevangelo> yea
[03:43] <jevangelo> i need to rethink my strategie
[03:44] <agent> lambo4jos: never used a gui for mysql... have you looked at www.mysql.com? there is a community section with program names... mysql-query is not what you want
[03:44] <lambo4jos> agent: i have also tried to install mysql-query-browser from source and couldn't get it working
[03:44] <jevangelo> i run sarg for squid, and all this creating and removing these huge directory structures for the sarg reports has made my /var reiser filesystem unhealthy
[03:45] <agent> lambo4jos: mysql-query-browser is not what you want... it just shows you queries from what i remember - and it works because i tried it a few days ago
[03:45] <agent> lambo4jos: i tried it from the official ubuntu repositories (no sources)
[03:46] <agent> jevangelo: it not a big deal, just start the rm when you go to sleep and have it shutdown after rm is finished
[03:47] <agent> jevangelo: sudo -i to become 'root' and then run: rm mydirectory/ -rf && shutdown -h now
[03:47] <jevangelo> haha
[03:47] <lambo4jos> agent: mine works fine too from 'sudo apt-get install mysql-query-browser'.  i can create a table but when I try to edit a table it shuts down.  no idea why.  any ideas?

[03:49] <agent> jevangelo: you should have added a cron job to clean it up
[03:49] <jevangelo> im going to make a rotate script, and do some reiserfs tools on the volume
[03:49] <agent> jevangelo: so your going to mess with the filesystem? and your telling me that rm'ing the whole dir is bad?
[03:50] <jevangelo> well, maybee i wont do the reiserfs tools
[03:50] <jevangelo> bad idea
[03:50] <agent> lol
[03:50] <rc-1> also how do i mount the external hd?
[03:53] <agent> rc-1: if you want to do it the hard way, find out the /dev entry and do: sudo mount /dev/hdX /your/mount/folder

[03:59] <agent> shadwan: have you tried their webpage? i have no idea what dosbox is
[03:59] <itsmabus> You have to do quite a bit of stuff to get ubuntu working like most people want it to. That's because they can't include things like java and mp3 support on the cd for licensing reasons.
[03:59] <delaney> itsmabus, if thats for me.. all my mp3s work in every other application and audio works fine in the movies i just dont want to get the window error.  First i get an error about -vo  then when i switch it to xv/x11 i get the mp3 error

[04:00] <agent> lovloss: it was a joke (sort of) -- its a VERY instane and powerful editor
[04:00] <shadwan> agent: cheers, i have. it looks pretty clear but i can't understand it. it seems windows orientated. but it is (apparently) linux too.
[04:00] <itsmabus> delaney: Maybe you're missing edgy plugins. I guess I jumped in on that question late.
[04:00] <missingxtension> delaney: you need automatix its ascripts that install most basic functions that are missing
[04:00] <lovloss> agent: Well i need something. Anjunta keeps asking me to go get 'glib', and eclipse crashes every time i boot up
[04:01] <vanberge> lambo4jos, i can help you there... it is web based, would that help?
[04:01] <lovloss> i dunno how complicated it can be to make a program that has a 'compile and run' button. :P
[04:01] <agent> lovloss: you have to realize that a lot hackers dont use ide's tis why they are not really many of them - you would be surprised at how much they keep you from doing your work faster
[04:01] <agent> lovloss: why when you can just write a one line script to do that for you? :)
[04:01] <lovloss> agent: except that you have to issue two commands to test a source. first, compile, then run
[04:01] <rc-1> agent, eerg so confused sorry :( nothings showing up in /media, or the computer folder, how do i know what its called to mount it?
[04:02] <agent> lovloss: and you have the advantage of using whatever program you want
[04:02] <lovloss> agent: how can that be done in one line?
[04:02] <missingxtension> delaney: it install all media codecs necesary for normal enjoyable use
[04:02] <lovloss> because i knew, i run over and over ...
[04:02] <lovloss> *im new
[04:02] <agent> lovloss: depends on what you use... if you use make then: configure && make && make install && binaryfile_that_you_get
[04:02] <delaney> missingxtension, but all codecs ARE installed.  every video format.. every mp3.. flac.. wahtever
[04:03] <delaney> anything i throw at it works in EVERY application
[04:03] <delaney> but mplayer
[04:03] <lovloss> agent: what about libraries?
[04:03] <delaney> just seems odd.
[04:03] <delaney> seeing as how it was always sufficient before (since hoary)
[04:03] <lovloss> agent: is iostream, strings, and such already built in?
[04:03] <tuna-fish-> shadwan: search for dosboxgui or dbgui
[04:03] <missingxtension> did u install the mplayer plug ins?
[04:03] <shadwan> tuna-fish-: i will. cheers.
[04:03] <agent> lovloss: if you are including them then they should be compiled with make... if not then your not using make correctly... or if you are compiling libraries that should not be included :P
[04:04] <nu> Which file do i edit for startup programs? i added gDesklets once but now i don't remember how to take it off
[04:04] <missingxtension> i dont use mplayer unfortunately, have u tried listen? its comparable to windows media
[04:04] <lovloss> agent: if i #include <library>, where does it load the library from? is there a namespace std somewhere?
[04:04] <agent> lovloss: you use make to compile and install a program from source code - if it does not work then you are not using make properly
[04:04] <delaney> missingxtension, mplayer and firefox mplayer..   im unable to find any other plugisn for mplayer in the repos ive got
[04:04] <delaney> and im almost positive i never needed anything else before..
[04:04] <tuna-fish-> shadwan: it's a tcl script I use for playing old games, mainly colonization and master of magic. It's not issue-free, but is easier to get working than a genuine dos install with sound and enough low ram...
[04:05] <delaney> though i tend to be forgetful so maybe im missing something
[04:05] <lovloss> agent: Im just curious if I have to go *download* libraries like iostream and stdio
[04:05] <agent> lovloss: i cant answer that question because i dont hack c++.... but make is used for just about every language... open up almost any source deb file and you will see make scripts :)
[04:05] <trappist> delaney: check the RestrictedFormats wiki page

[04:07] <lovloss> ok so say i make a file called hi.cpp on the desktop and i want to compile it. configure && make && make install && hi.cpp   ??
[04:08] <lovloss> hmm that sounds wrong
[04:08] <delaney> ive installed every mp3 package from restricted formats for good measure
[04:08] <agent> rc-1: make sure you plug in that hard drive to a power outlet (if it requires it) - if the hard drive does not use external power, make sure you are connecting it to a usb port that supports powering devices (most usually do not)
[04:08] <delaney> i guess im just gonna have to deal with it or compile from source
[04:09] <bruenig> lovloss, assuming hi.cpp has the ability to compile, you would run something like ./hi.cpp && make && make install
[04:09] <shiv> Is there any program like shutdown timer?
[04:09] <LjL> lovloss: err... yeah it's quite wrong :-) "configure" and "make" are meaningful only when a build system was used with the program
[04:09] <tuna-fish-> lovloss: only if you have plenty of scripts ready that tell where to install and how to configure and make.
[04:09] <tjb891> i have to convert some .avi to mpeg what program should i use
[04:09] <Flannel> lovloss: if it's just a single file, there's no configuring, or making.  You'll just be invoking gcc manually
[04:09] <agent> lovloss: it is :) make and configure are for "advanced" usage
[04:09] <lovloss> wait im confused :( How do you make a file buildable?
[04:09] <LjL> lovloss: if it's just a test program of yours, type "g++ hi.cpp", and you'll get an executable (called a.out by default) in the same directory
[04:09] <LjL> lovloss: (if there are no errors, of course)
[04:10] <lovloss> oh
[04:10] <agent> :D
[04:10] <delaney> the odd thing is when i open a video file in firefox it works flawlessly and i dont get the error
[04:10] <LjL> lovloss, you just call the C/C++ compiler and give it the file as a parameter

[04:12] <ThePub> agent: it should play them, and apparently it does.  lol.. idk why it wasn't doing it before, I was only getting that error.  I restarted again and now it's working.
[04:12] <nu-> is there a dreamweaver like program for linux?  (dont need designer mode)
[04:12] <tuna-fish-> it works best if you throw random values at it until everything works smooth :)
[04:12] <ThePub> agent: a little "magic" in the pipeline somewhere I guess
[04:13] <Flannel> nu-: check out nvu
[04:13] <agent> ThePub: my guess would be that you did not restart totem after you installed dvd support
[04:13] <nu-> Flannel: thanks
[04:13] <Flannel> nu-: wait, designer mode is the code? or the WYSIWYMG?
[04:13] <shadwan> tuna-fish-: it's running. i see the screenshot of someone running discworld, but i can't find the appropriate file in my Theme Park folder to get it doing anything...
[04:13] <ThePub> agent: it was never started when installing anything :)
[04:13] <agent> ThePub: or.... you thought you restarted it but you did not :)
[04:13] <ThePub> agent: so you're guess would be wrong :)
[04:13] <agent> ThePub: then i dont know
[04:13] <sysdoc> nu-, Quanta is more like DW
[04:13] <lovloss> NVU annoys me a bit, i wish they'd make a better one. It doesnt even have an "embed video" option. you have to do it manually.
[04:13] <lovloss> i cant wait to be a dev :P
[04:14] <nu-> sysdoc: ill look at both. thanks
[04:14] <tuna-fish-> thepub: so you sure you have libdvdcss2 installed?
[04:14] <tuna-fish-> shadwan: it's the .bat or .exe
[04:14] <rc-1> agent, tripple checked all of the connections, nothing :\
[04:14] <Red-Sox> No one knows how to make a program start at startup??
[04:14] <lovloss> Quanta is for KDE :(
[04:14] <lovloss> will it run in gnome tho?
[04:14] <lambo4jos> vanberge: yes that would help
[04:14] <agent> rc-1: check using lshw
[04:14] <Born_In_Xixax> Red-Sox: yes, via the Sessions applet under System|Preferences
[04:14] <burner> hey, what can someone suggest to capture a screencast that is available via apt?  I tried byzanz via command line to no avail
[04:15] <sysdoc> Quanta running in Gnome here, lol
[04:15] <nu-> so quanta will run on gnome?
[04:15] <Red-Sox> Born_In_Xixax: thanks
[04:15] <vanberge> lambo4jos, ok... let me see what i use
[04:15] <szekely> does anyone have any ideas why my audio cds show up as "CD-Rom Disc"?
[04:15] <lovloss> hmm... i couldnt get kdevelope to work on gnome
[04:15] <JB2_> Does the Ubuntu CD boot on intel Macs?
[04:16] <Born_In_Xixax> you can create different sessions with different sets of startup apps, if you like
[04:16] <tuna-fish-> thePub: note that libdvdcss2 is illegal in some countries. Can be found from Penguin Liberation Army repos
[04:16] <ThePub> I've started using scribes more as an editing environment.
[04:16] <lovloss> Oh, does anyone know where i can go to find source to create my programs in a little gnome window? :)
[04:16] <vanberge> lambo4jos,  phpMyAdmin is what i use....
[04:16] <Red-Sox> Born_In_Xixax: How do I tell it which workspace I want it to start in?
[04:16] <lovloss> that is, to execute them in one
[04:16] <vanberge> its a web app... www.yoursite.com/phpmyadmin
[04:16] <ThePub> tuna-fish-: it's all working now, just took a couple of restarts.  Agent was probably right to a degree that I hadn't found all the zombie processes from earlier attempts.
[04:16] <Born_In_Xixax> at the login screen, click on Options
[04:16] <agent> lovloss: you can use just about any kde program in gnome and vice-versa... the problem being is that 1) you have to download kde libs and 2) you have to load them when running the program - they will be loaded themselves of course, but the problem is resource hogging :)
[04:16] <Born_In_Xixax> you can choose a session from there
[04:17] <lovloss> agent: ahhh i see.... good to know
[04:17] <lovloss> i suppose ill need the kde libraries then. might as well have them
[04:17] <ski-worklap> http://bandcamp.tv/linux-demotivators/
[04:17] <ThePub> nu-: if there's a gtksource highlighter for your language, you might want to check out scribes if you can work with just a solid editor :)
[04:18] <agent> ThePub: easy way to fix that is: 1) ps -ef | grep <your program binary name> and 2) pkill <your program binary name>
[04:18] <nu-> ThePub: i can. but i want the convenience of my files listed on the right side(like in dreameaver).
[04:18] <agent> ThePub: #1 searches for <your program binary name> and #2 kills it :)
[04:18] <nu-> so thats pretty much all im looking for
[04:18] <lexi__> hi @all. just installed latest kernel security updates for edgy. at the end apt installl called update-initramfs what caused these error-messages http://www.ubuntuusers.de/paste/5945/ . the resulting initrd.img is not bootable.  help is very much appreciated :)
[04:18] <shadwan> tuna-fish-: i've tried all the .exe's. i have TP.EXE, SETUP.EXE, and DOS4GW.EXE, and all come up with errors when i click on Run DosBox.
[04:18] <ThePub> nu-: so open a list-mode nautilus window next to it :D
[04:18] <lambo4jos> vanberge: i am running ruby on rails mysql and webrick
[04:18] <rc-1> agent, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37107/
[04:18] <h0ndaracer3> hey everyone am i welcome here
[04:19] <lambo4jos> vanberge: how can i get phpmyadmin to work with this setup
[04:19] <ThePub> h0ndaracer3: go away?  ^_^
[04:19] <nu-> ThePub: haha but i like do double-click the file and have it open in a new tab in the program, etc
[04:19] <h0ndaracer3> why
[04:19] <tuna-fish-> shadwan: TP.EXE, most likely, but what errors?
[04:19] <rc-1> agent, theres also a light on even when its off, not sure what that means
[04:20] <factboy818181> hi
[04:20] <factboy818181> is there a file comparer for ubuntu?
[04:20] <factboy818181> like WinMerge for windows?

[04:20] <tjb891> does anyone here know a good GUI for ffmpeg?
[04:20] <factboy818181> ok
[04:21] <factboy818181> thanks
[04:21] <vanberge> lambo4jos, i'm not familiar with those... i use apache.  :-(    did you try #mysql?
[04:21] <shadwan> tuna-fish-: sound devices - ALSA, MIDI, ALSA no device type things, and not able to load config files. it runs dosbox, but all i have is a command line with z:.
[04:21] <tuna-fish-> weird
[04:21] <agent> rc-1: i don't know what to tell you.... that is very strange... make sure your hard drive is powered on is the only thing i can suggest... you should hear the hard drive spin up once you plug in the power even if its disconnected from the usb port
[04:21] <shadwan> tuna-fish-: the errors come up when i close dosbox
[04:21] <h0ndaracer3> heyim bak
[04:22] <rc-1> agent, ah thanks for help! im sure its powered though cuase when i turn it on i hear the HD in it starting up
[04:22] <lovloss> no one knows where i can get code to make a gnome app? :D
[04:22] <rc-1> agent, if the file system was corrupt would it do this?
[04:23] <agent> lovloss: tons of places... for c++ i don't know but you can probably look at www.gnome.org in their developers section
[04:23] <ThePub> on the location bar in nautilus, is it possible to remove the "view as ..." drop down and zoom settings?
[04:23] <CowEdgy> how do i install icons theme?
[04:23] <CowEdgy> it's in a tarball format
[04:23] <CowEdgy> :(
[04:23] <agent> rc-1: probably not - it may not mount it, yes, but it should still be listed in lsusb
[04:24] <ThePub> if nautilus was just a little more like how konq looks the gnome desktop would be a really good setup
[04:24] <agent> ThePub: i dont think that is a normal option, you can try looking in gconf-editor
[04:24] <agent> ThePub: if it is not in gconf-editor then the option does not exist.. you would have to edit the source code and compile it (way too much work of course)
[04:24] <ThePub> agent: yeah, been all through those settings.  of course, holding this back too, is the fact that you cannot configure the toolbars in nautilus.. they are what they are.
[04:24] <vanberge> does anybody know of any software that can take a screen 'video' instead of a screen 'shot' ?  :-)
[04:25] <agent> ThePub: welcome to gnome :)
[04:25] <nu-> i guess nvu doesn't support php highliting?
[04:25] <agent> vanberge: xvidcap
[04:25] <ThePub> agent: hehe, nautilus always was the stickler for me with gnome.  ever since forever :)
[04:26] <capi_> Azureus doesn't gets a NAT error for regular users. How can I allow normal users to bind to a port( I'm not understanding why I can't normally )
[04:26] <nothlit> pcmanfm is nice
[04:26] <agent> CowEdgy: not sure... check out gnome-look.org they give instructions... it may be just a drag-drop procedure or you may have to extract the tarball
[04:26] <burner> I think it'd be neat if nautilus had "Finder's" new browsing ability in OS X
[04:26] <CowEdgy> thanks agent
[04:26] <burner> nu-, nvu won't even open .php here
[04:26] <nothlit> !bluefish | burner
[04:26] <ubotu> bluefish: advanced Gtk+ HTML editor. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.6-1 (edgy), package size 1568 kB, installed size 6728 kB
[04:26] <capi_> agent, for themes it's drag and drop.
[04:26] <nu-> =( any other suggestions then?
[04:26] <ThePub> burner: what's that do?  it'd be nice if you could drill down with it too.
[04:27] <nu-> burner: do you have any other suggestions?
[04:27] <burner> nu-, i use gedit
[04:27] <ThePub> nu-: bluefish supports php highlighting
[04:27] <burner> gedit or scite here
[04:28] <nu-> ThePub: thanks
[04:28] <capi_> nu-, emacs or vim or course ;)
[04:28] <nu-> burner: gedit doesn't have auto completion does it?
[04:28] <agent> capi_: try scribes
[04:28] <burner> nu-, check out "screem" too
[04:28] <ThePub> nu-: download and install eclipse and get the php ide? :)
[04:28] <nu-> guys lol hold on-- my goal is not to use a simple editor because lack of autocompletion and file tree listing consumes time
[04:29] <nu-> im going to try bluefish
[04:29] <agent> capi_: check the flash video showing features here: http://scribes.sourceforge.net/media_videos.html
[04:29] <ThePub> agent: scribes rocks :)
[04:29] <nu-> bluefish supports python too? this is gold
[04:30] <agent> nu-: actually, that depends on your skill level... i could never ever use an ide now - i would go crazy
[04:30] <capi_> agent, *shrugs* I like emacs. :\ PHPeclipse, and JEdit as well if you don't mind java
[04:30] <nothlit> Wow installing eclipse takes 372 mb and skipping 2 packages?
[04:30] <nu-> agent: having to type full paths ot my pictures and files, drives me crazy
[04:30] <agent> ThePub: yes it does rock... more than vim even
[04:31] <ThePub> nothlit: eclipse is an application framework with an IDE built on top of it.  There's more there than you consider at first blush.  :)
[04:31] <agent> nu-: you should not have to retype paths anyway... you use variables :)
[04:31] <nu-> in CSS, no such things
[04:31] <CowEdgy> how do i install themes? Install Theme in Theme Preferences says it's an invalid format.... what's the right format?
[04:31] <nu-> unless my css is a php but that is not always the case
[04:32] <nu-> but, if i use many images, thats a lot of paths ill have to type
[04:32] <capi_> agent, I'm pretty sure emacs kicks scribes ass on features and ease. Specially nice if you take the effort to get anti-aliasing for the GUI.
[04:32] <nothlit> ../images/image.png?
[04:32] <nu-> plus, the tiny colorcode table it opens up whenever i type *color:' is gold also
[04:33] <agent> nu-: there is a css editor just os you know with completion... i tried using it but i cant stand normal editors even if they have those fancy stuff (which is useless if you know how to code well in the first place)... the program is called cssed
[04:33] <nu-> agent: i'll pass. im trying screem now.
[04:33] <nu-> im just lazy and i like to type as little as possible
[04:33] <agent> capi_: i would disagree - i thought that too but being an "ex" vim user (developer of scribes is also long time ex-vim user)
[04:33] <ThePub> capi_: emacs is a feature, not filled with features :)  scribes doesn't worry about adding the kitchen sink, it's just a really fast, feature-useful text edtior.
[04:33] <rc-1> My external hard drive isn't showing up in lsusb, it worked just yesterday any ideas why? sounds like it's starting when i turn it on
[04:33] <agent> nu-: okay... use what works for you :)
[04:34] <nu-> ;] 
[04:34] <agent> ok ok
[04:34] <agent> no emacs vs vim vs scribes flame war :)
[04:35] <ThePub> emacs is more like eclipse if you want to compare
[04:35] <capi_> lol, vim is great for CLI, though. emacs is more GUI, personally, but yeah, whatever works best for ya.
[04:35] <ThePub> it's an "environment"
[04:36] <capi_> or IDE.
[04:36] <nu-> god that is annoying
[04:36] <agent> or operating system
[04:36] <ThePub> well.. emacs really isn't an ide unless you're writing lisp
[04:36] <eltech> does the default networking tools to configure wireless and such support WEP 64/128 bit?
[04:36] <capi_> :P
[04:36] <ThePub> emacs + slime really can't be beat for lisp programming :)
[04:36] <capi_> Oh, yeah baby.
[04:36] <aL\away> checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables

[04:39] <aL\away> do i have to install it with synaptic
[04:39] <capi_> tirus, 7950 does have the problem, but you might want to search the forums. I  remember seeing some problems when edgy first came out.
[04:39] <capi_> tirus, doesn't.
[04:39] <malt> whats a good simple smtp server?
[04:39] <aL\away> i m abit lost

[04:40] <shadwan> tuna-fish-: cheers anyway. i'll try again tomorrow.
[04:40] <ThePub> tirus: idk specifically about any issues with that card, but for my particular setup I have to edit the xorg.conf of the installer after the startup, before X loads or it'll do something similar
[04:40] <bimberi> malt: postfix
[04:40] <tirus> Thx, is there a way to force a strictly text-based install...or a guide on how to edit the xorg.conf as ThePub just mentioned?
[04:41] <HLM> !EasySource
[04:41] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[04:41] <bimberi> tirus: text-based install means getting the alternate CD
[04:41] <ThePub> tirus: or starting in single-user mode first on the cd.
[04:41] <tirus> I c
[04:41] <GigaClon> I wanna install FireFox 1.5
[04:41] <malt> bimberi postfix i just install and thats it?
[04:42] <malt> and it should work with phpbb and php nuke to send emails?
[04:42] <agent> nu-: in gnome just preferences -> sessions -> startup
[04:42] <nu-> agent: thanks
[04:42] <bimberi> malt: basically.  iirc it will allow local users/processes to send ootb
[04:42] <agent> omg... awk has NF variable...
[04:42] <malt> ootb?
[04:43] <bimberi> malt: out of the box  (sorry, i'm lazy :) )
[04:43] <aL\away> i didnt find it

[04:45] <bimberi> sn0wm4n: are they members of the audio group?  - 'groups username' will tell you
[04:46] <capiCrimm> ThePub, have you ever used OpenGL in lisp?
[04:46] <sn0wm4n> bimberi: thats the thing -- yes
[04:46] <ThePub> capiCrimm: beyong some basic lisp hacking I've barely did text UIs in lisp :)
[04:46] <eltech> would vsftpd be included on the dektop/laptop cd?
[04:46] <sn0wm4n> bimberi: thats the first thing I've checked
[04:47] <bimberi> sn0wm4n: hm, then i'm not sure sorry :| perhaps someone else?
[04:47] <ThePub> capiCrimm: I have friends who like lisp, me.. I'm a java, groovy, c guy :)
[04:47] <sn0wm4n> bimberi: thanks
[04:47] <bimberi> eltech: no, i'm fairly sure not - it would probably be on the DVD image
[04:48] <malt> bimberi: what is some ways i can access postfix?
[04:48] <eontasticness> so i want to remove evolution, but if i do sudo apt-get remove evolution it says its gonna remove ubuntu-desktop too --- will that screw up everything
[04:48] <eontasticness> ?
[04:48] <GigaClon> no
[04:48] <bimberi> malt: if you install "mailx" you get the classic text based mail interface.  You can use that to test.
[04:48] <nu-> i removed it
[04:48] <malt> is there a link to it liek phpmyadmin or is it all in background bimberi?
[04:48] <capiCrimm> ThePub, eh, I can't stand Java, nasty, nasty language, but C is okay.
[04:48] <GigaClon> its just meta package
[04:48] <GigaClon> I love Java
[04:48] <nu-> python ftw
[04:49] <capiCrimm> GigaClon, that's because your not used to other language idioms.
[04:50] <bimberi> malt: all in background.  it listens on port 25 and processes that need it will connect to that
[04:50] <mrcucumber> Does on get access to Oreilly rough cuts if you sign up for Safari?
[04:50] <ThePub> capiCrimm: I suppose.  It's pretty much ubiquitous in corporate services segments.  Groovy though sits on the JVM and can use the java library, but has a much more sane syntax imo.
[04:50] <dibblego> is there ever going to be a 6.06.2?

[04:53] <Red-Sox> Hrm
[04:53] <Red-Sox> Can someone highlight me?
[04:53] <ThePub> capiCrimm: just a stock install of what?
[04:54] <malt> bimberi: after i install mailx or something, is there a way i need to access it to like secure it?
[04:54] <malt> or password it?
[04:54] <Red-Sox> ...or not...
[04:54] <capiCrimm> ThePub, edgy, it's not a virgin install, though.
[04:54] <ThePub> capiCrimm: are you sure you're not being blocked at your cable, dsl, etc, router?
[04:55] <capiCrimm> ThePub, yep. Like I said root works.
[04:55] <helloyo> can i install edgy on the command line, or must i go through gnome?
[04:55] <juancarlos> ThePub: if root isn't blocked.
[04:55] <bimberi> malt: no, it should run from the command line.  Or do you mean to stop other users on the system from using it?
[04:55] <ThePub> capiCrimm: are you using ports above.. what is it, 1000?
[04:55] <ThePub> or is it 5000?
[04:55] <ThePub> I forget where "user" ports begin :D
[04:55] <capiCrimm> I forget as well, but I'm well above it.
[04:56] <bimberi> helloyo: alternate cd has a text-based installer
[04:56] <ThePub> hmm
[04:56] <capiCrimm> 36417, 6881-6890 are the ones I've tried.
[04:56] <capiCrimm> all of them come back with unable to bind
[04:56] <agent> helloyo: there are also version of ubuntu that use something other than gnome (kubuntu uses kde, xubuntu uses xfce, etc.)
[04:56] <DARKGuy> Hey, I have a question about the Server Install CD (is it the alternate one too?)... does it has a way to install itself into the drive, or do I have to do it manually like some other Linux CLI distros? also, it's a full-featured CLI-like install for servers or it's just a lightweight barebones CLI install with nothing else, just the basic stuff?
[04:56] <helloyo> bimberi: so i have to download another cd...
[04:57] <ThePub> capiCrimm: tyring to run more than one torrent?  first one works, second doesn't?
[04:57] <Megaqwerty> what is the best text to speech program for ubuntu?
[04:57] <juancarlos> capiCrimm, try installing firestarter (a simple firewall) and use the gui to set it up
[04:57] <helloyo> agent: yeah, i'm trying to not have to download another cd, so just install the base ubuntu system, then install ontop of it
[04:57] <Megaqwerty> (by best I mean most humanlike)
[04:57] <agent> !server | DARKGuy
[04:57] <ubotu> DARKGuy: Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current stable version is 6.06 LTS. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/
[04:57] <Red-Sox> !test | Red-Sox
[04:57] <ubotu> Red-Sox: Failed.
[04:57] <Red-Sox> Hrm
[04:57] <DARKGuy> agent, okay, but that isn't the alternate CD that you all talk about, right?
[04:57] <ThePub> capiCrimm: probably a dumb question, but I got that same issue with the gnome torrent client when downloading multiple torrents (seperate processes trying to bind to the same port)
[04:58] <bimberi> DARKGuy: alternate and server are separate images.  Each with a different package set.  Alternate is desktop focused (eg. X, Gnome/KDE). Server is server focussed (eg. LAMP)
[04:58] <Krinkle> I just set up ubuntu today for the first time. I didn't use the live cd I used the text one. While installing it said it couldn't find a network card, but after installed it sees them in the networking panel and I activated them but I cannot get to any websites. Am I missing something stupidly obvious? It's not wireless so my router doesn't have an excuse to bounce me. I am confused.
[04:58] <DARKGuy> bimberi, Ah I see, great thanks :)
[04:58] <bimberi> helloyo: is the Desktop CD not working for you?  (if so, then yes)
[04:58] <bimberi> DARKGuy: np :)
[04:58] <helloyo> bimberi: technically yes, but its excruciatingly slow, i'd love to just drop it to a shell, and install there
[04:59] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: and yet you are talking to us?
[04:59] <juancarlos> ThePub, can't it be that the iptables has normal users under restrictive mode?
[04:59] <agent> helloyo: yes, you can just install a bare system and then install a desktop that you want (or not)... for example, ubuntu-desktop gives you ubuntu which is gnome, kubuntu-desktop kde, etc.
[04:59] <aL\away> /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:59] <rc-1> usb hd isnt showing up in lsusb; getting this error: Dec 14 22:15:30 Andrew kernel: [17182357.556000]  end_request: I/O error, dev hdb, sector 4
[04:59] <rc-1> Dec 14 22:21:20 Andrew kernel: [17182707.776000]  usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
[04:59] <aL\away> i tried to edit
[04:59] <helloyo> agent: can i do this with the desktop cd, without going through gnome?
[04:59] <Krinkle> I set up a dual boot so I just logged back into windows
[04:59] <aL\away> but it says i neeed root
[04:59] <Megaqwerty> ah
[04:59] <aL\away> it did nt ask for pass
[04:59] <aL\away> how do i do it
[04:59] <agent> helloyo: you should note that the alternate only has ubuntu i think, you will have to have internet working to install kubuntu and others from the alternate cd
[04:59] <bimberi> helloyo: ah. sorry, Ubiquity (the GUI installer) is the only way with the Desktop CD.
[04:59] <Megaqwerty> krinkle: let me read over your question again
[05:00] <capiCrimm> hehe, got it. I was binding to my old static IP. Love moving computers around.
[05:00] <agent> helloyo: no, not through desktop cd as far as i know
[05:00] <capiCrimm> root wasn't configured so there was no binding.
[05:00] <bimberi> aL\away: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:00] <juancarlos> capiCrimm, lol
[05:00] <helloyo> bimberi: agent: ah ok, thanks, i'll see if i can get the installer to come up in the next 10 minutes, or i'll try something else, thanks
[05:00] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: I suggest getting the network-manager-gnome...hold on, I'll get you a download site
[05:00] <Megaqwerty> it makes things so much easier
[05:01] <VerdRousseau> Anyone got a dell wireless card working?
[05:01] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, me
[05:01] <VerdRousseau> what kind
[05:01] <Krinkle> I hope so there weren't many options besides DHCP or manual.
[05:01] <eontasticness> like a dell Truemobile?
[05:01] <VerdRousseau> yeh
[05:01] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, 1400
[05:01] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/net/network-manager-gnome
[05:01] <eontasticness> i think those use the ralink driver
[05:01] <eontasticness> on some of them
[05:01] <Krinkle> Megaqwerty: okay. After I get this file how do I get it to this partition that I can't see from windows? Flash drive?
[05:01] <VerdRousseau> juancarlos whatd you use to get that working
[05:02] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: yeah that works
[05:02] <juancarlos> ndiswrapper
[05:02] <VerdRousseau> did you use the driver on the disc
[05:02] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: I personally just made an extra FAT partition
[05:02] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, support.dell.com...
=== Railroad is now known as jumper
[05:02] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: but that is for later
[05:02] <VerdRousseau> and what files did you use in it
[05:02] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, the one's ndiswrapper told me to use.
[05:02] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: before you go....
[05:03] <aL\away> ok
[05:03] <VerdRousseau> I mean was it in the win98 file or the winxp
[05:03] <aL\away> ok its done
[05:03] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: you should know that it may say something like "the following dependencies are missing" or something of the like, in which case, here is what you do...
[05:03] <aL\away> what do i do now
[05:03] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, XP.
[05:03] <aL\away> to install egdrop
[05:03] <Krinkle> Megaqwerty: Still here. Also does it matter what file format the flash drive is in?
[05:03] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, it works out of the box on my new laptop though.
[05:03] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: what do you mean?
[05:04] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: did you change it from factory settings?
[05:04] <VerdRousseau> juancarlos- for Ubuntu you didnt even have to do anything?
[05:04] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, can't seem to get it into promiscous mode though.
[05:04] <juancarlos> nope...
[05:04] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: if you didn't reformat it as something else, it should be fine, but it should be fine regardless
[05:04] <Krinkle> megaqwerty: no it just seemed like the kind of thing I would forget about and would turn out to make a huge difference... it's fat I just checked but I was just being careful
[05:04] <Megaqwerty> I'm pretty sure Ubuntu can read anything
[05:04] <VerdRousseau> before when you did install it manually did you have to copy any files manually
[05:05] <VerdRousseau> cant read my truemobile 1180
[05:05] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, of course.
[05:05] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: I understand, now I'll finish writing what I was saying before
[05:06] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: \you go back to the site I gave you, and click on the package that it told you you didn't have, and download it. It's pretty simple actually. Oh, and all you have to do is double click on the file and click  "open" and that will ask you for your admin password, give it to the program, and then after clicking install, it will do so.
[05:06] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, have you tried ndiswrapper?
[05:06] <aL\away> i have enabled universe
[05:06] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: that should be all you need to know.
[05:06] <VerdRousseau> yes
[05:06] <aL\away> eggdrop is still showin
[05:06] <aL\away> that msg
[05:06] <VerdRousseau> all the drivers are installed
[05:06] <shadowhywind> hay all, is it safe to remove the linux-restricted-modules?
[05:06] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: if not, I should still be here for a while
[05:06] <VerdRousseau> but nothin is being picked up
[05:06] <aL\away> checking for gcc... gcc
[05:06] <aL\away> checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[05:06] <juancarlos> hmmm
[05:07] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, can you ifup/ifdown?
[05:07] <jumper> I installed ububtu (with a bit of difficulty)... switched to KDE (I really dislike Gnome) and edited xorg.conf with nano as screen resolution does not seem to be on the properties editor
[05:07] <VerdRousseau> ifup down the wlan0
[05:07] <arrenlex> shadowhywind: Yes, if you don't need any of them -- no closed-source graphics drivers on your system, are there?
[05:07] <Krinkle> Megaqwerty: Thanks. Also these are a lot of different files is  NetworkManager-0.6.4.tar.gz the right one?
[05:07] <VerdRousseau> ill try
[05:07] <jumper> I started xchat, (I did all the updates)
[05:07] <jrib> aL\away: eggdrop is in universe, you don't need to compile it
[05:07] <arrenlex> aL\away: You need to install build-essential
[05:07] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: oh no, you need the one that ends in .deb
[05:07] <jumper> it is a much older version than I am used to (or am using now)
[05:08] <shadowhywind> arrenlex not that i am aware of
[05:08] <rc-1> external hd not showing up in lsusb, but the kernel says this when i plug it in: Dec 14 22:15:30 Andrew kernel: [17182357.556000]  end_request: I/O error, dev hdb, sector 4Dec 14 22:21:20 Andrew kernel: [17182707.776000]  usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
[05:08] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: this page: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?arch=i386&file=pool%2Fmain%2Fn%2Fnetwork-manager%2Fnetwork-manager-gnome_0.6.3-2ubuntu6_i386.deb&md5sum=1f857fb5abaa57675e4695baf66289b5&arch=i386&type=main
[05:08] <jumper> is there a seperate way to update old programs,  update all in sympatic didn't touch it
[05:08] <arrenlex> shadowhywind: If you remove it and devices suddenly stop working, put it back. Otherwise knock yourself out.
[05:08] <aL\away> ow ok
[05:08] <VerdRousseau> with ifdown wlan0 I get Network is down
[05:08] <VerdRousseau> SI0csidfflags: No such device
[05:09] <shadowhywind> when i try to uninstall it it also wants to uninstall linux-386, this would be a BAD thing right
[05:09] <VerdRousseau> keeps trying to send packet but says Network is Down
[05:09] <Krinkle> one last thing, is there a huge difference between the i386 and the amd64 downloads of ubuntu? I wasn't sure if my C2D processor was 64bit but now I am and I already installed the other
[05:09] <aL\away> i did
[05:09] <Lanky> heyhey
[05:09] <h0ndaracer3> how do i delete a file that it wont let me delete
[05:09] <aL\away> do i have to configure config file
[05:09] <arrenlex> shadowhywind: linux-386 is a metapackage IIRC.
[05:09] <aL\away> and run for termenal
[05:10] <ThePub> juancarlos: Oh, I'm sure.. was just asking the easy question :)
[05:10] <shadowhywind> arrenlex which means?
[05:10] <arrenlex> !metapackage | shadowhywind
[05:10] <ubotu> shadowhywind: A meta-package is a package that simply depends upon other packages and brings them in. It's not a real package, but a very useful package that can drag in other package versions.
[05:10] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: Just what architecture that it is made for
[05:10] <VerdRousseau> juancralos: after ifup final thing is No working leases in persistent database - sleeping
[05:10] <shadowhywind> so if i remove linux-i386 its not going to breal the system
[05:10] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: if you have an intel processor it is the i386 architecture
[05:11] <aL\away> arrenlex
[05:11] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, hmmm ho to System-networking
[05:11] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, hmmm go to System-networking*
[05:11] <jb0nd38372> Evening everyone
[05:11] <aL\away> do i now edit bot config and run eggdrop from terminal
[05:11] <VerdRousseau> yeh in networking I only have
[05:11] <VerdRousseau> 2 wired connections wlan0 and etho0
[05:11] <Krinkle> alright thanks. Going to try it now.
[05:11] <VerdRousseau> eth0
[05:11] <arrenlex> shadowhywind: No. If you're removing packages that have lots of numbers at the end, like linux-image-2.6.18-3-686, then you have a problem.
[05:12] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: good luck
[05:12] <shadowhywind> hehe thanks
[05:12] <rafael_> Hi all
=== rafael_ is now known as _Astra_
[05:12] <rc-1> erg please someone help me :( my final project is on my external hd and  i cant get it to be recognized in lsusb
[05:13] <_Astra_> Hi all... anyone here has ever used frame buffer over Ubuntu?
[05:14] <alexander_> hey all!
[05:14] <alexander_> can some1 help me out?
[05:14] <arrenlex> !anyone | alexander_
[05:14] <ubotu> alexander_: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:14] <jumper> I installed ubuntu to try it, I looked it over a year or so ago, did not like it (I have used Xandros about 3 years)
[05:14] <arrenlex> jumper: You can use the liveCD to try it :)
[05:15] <alexander_> I'm kinda new to ubuntu, and Linux for that matter... im trying to add a language
[05:15] <jumper> ubuntu seems to be the 'in'thing, I installed it again to use a few days to see what everyone else sees that I did not
[05:15] <aL\away> arrenlex
[05:15] <ubuntu> hey u use ubuntu
[05:15] <aL\away> i have installed eggdrop
[05:15] <ubuntu> but i don't how to use it.
[05:15] <aL\away> now do i have to edit config file
[05:15] <ubuntu> someone help
[05:15] <jumper> in 3 years I never had to use command line with XN, so far to make the distro 'useable' I have had to manually edit xorg.conf
[05:16] <aL\away> i have never done it this way
[05:16] <ubuntu> eggdrop is shit
[05:16] <alexander_> how do you right a message adressed to some1 in this chat?
[05:16] <arrenlex> aL\away: yes?
[05:16] <appye> I removed a couple of the items in the list under the "networking" item under "administration" and now the program crashes every time I open it...
[05:16] <jumper> remaining problem, I set root password, and my password
[05:16] <ubuntu> i try to install it on fedora and it give me error
[05:16] <aL\away> i enabled universe and now installed eggdrop
[05:16] <alexander_> guys?
[05:16] <alexander_> anyone?
[05:16] <aL\away> whats my next step
[05:16] <arrenlex> alexander_: A private message?
[05:16] <ubuntu> from where are you
[05:17] <jumper> I am unable to log on as root, BUT when I foto term, synaptic etc, the root password works fine ?
[05:17] <appye> how would I go about fixing this?
[05:17] <alexander_> well not a private, but adressed to someone... like in red color
[05:17] <aL\away> do i edit the config file and from terminal type ./eggdrop -m bot.conf
[05:17] <arrenlex> !sudo | jumper
[05:17] <ubotu> jumper: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:17] <appye> I do not have a problem resetting all networking settings to default and reconfiguring networking from scratch.
[05:17] <jumper> saw and used that...
[05:17] <alexander_> arrenlex ?
[05:17] <arrenlex> alexander_: Yes?
[05:17] <jumper> but should  I not be able to log on as root ?
[05:18] <alexander_> how do i adress a message to you?
[05:18] <ubuntu> hmmm
[05:18] <arrenlex> jumper: Ubuntu has no root account. Use sudo -i for a root prompt.
[05:18] <arrenlex> alexander_: You just did.
[05:18] <arrenlex> alexander_: By using my name.
[05:18] <ubuntu> i try yo send arrenlex and you dont reply me
[05:18] <jumper> ok, that explains it
[05:18] <arrenlex> ubuntu: What are you trying to send me? xD
[05:18] <juancarlos> VerdRousseau, http://ubuntu-inspiron.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_ubuntu-inspiron_archive.html
[05:18] <alexander_> arrenlex, can you help me out?
[05:18] <jumper> have tried dozens of live cd's and distro's
[05:19] <arrenlex> alexander_: With adding languages? No; I don't use gnome.
[05:19] <jumper> each & all have root and guest
[05:19] <appye> anyone want to tell me how I can reset all networking settings back to factory defaults?  I borked my "networking" control panel dealybob
[05:19] <ubuntu> i want to remove languages
[05:19] <jumper> expected similar re root :)
[05:19] <alexander_> arrenlex, :(
[05:19] <ubuntu> and use only US
[05:19] <appye> from changing settings around.
[05:19] <arrenlex> jumper: Ubuntu is designed for newbies. Sudo helps them avoid shooting themselves in the foot.
[05:19] <ubuntu> Hey
[05:19] <ubuntu> Here
[05:19] <ubuntu> why i'm not admin in ubuntu
[05:19] <eontasticness> OMG UBUNTU IS HERE
[05:20] <jumper> somehow doubt a newbie would have manage to get it installed
[05:20] <arrenlex> eontasticness: Someone decides to be original every once in a while. :)
[05:20] <ubuntu> Ja UBUNTU is here
[05:20] <jumper> had awful fight with installer
[05:20] <jumper> havent even won yet
[05:20] <arrenlex> jumper: That's surprising. Usually the installer is very easy to use.
[05:20] <arrenlex> jumper: What problems are you having?
[05:20] <jumper> wanted to install on my second drive hdb
[05:20] <ubuntu> Hey why i'm not admin in UBUNTU
[05:20] <DARKGuy> oO I can't believe that, the installer is way easier than the one in... oO other distros I've ever tried
[05:21] <ubuntu> i ask me for password for every thing i do
[05:21] <arrenlex> ubuntu: There is no root account in ubuntu.
[05:21] <obe1> how do i tell what runlevel I am in?
[05:21] <ubuntu> yes there is
[05:21] <ubuntu> i ask me for admin pass
[05:21] <arrenlex> ubuntu: No, there isn't. o_O Not unless you made one.
[05:21] <arrenlex> ubuntu: No, it's asking you for your user password.
[05:21] <jumper> ubuntu was determined to use hda swap even tho I created and formatted a swap for it on hdb
[05:21] <obe1> arrenlex, there is certainly a root account
[05:21] <arrenlex> obe1: Not unless you made one yourself, no. Not in ubuntu.
[05:21] <arrenlex> !root
[05:21] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:21] <obe1> arrenlex, yes
[05:22] <ubuntu> ok how to make admin account in UBunut
[05:22] <appye> man .. there are too many people in this room.  I need to know where the file is that contains the list of ip addresess and whatnot in the "networking" control panel
[05:22] <ubuntu> Ubuntu
[05:22] <arrenlex> obe1: ...no? xD
[05:22] <ubuntu> perdon for the error
[05:22] <jumper> and on hdb it wanted touse, would not let me change to hdb7  a 10 meg part versus hdb3 a 3 meg partition
[05:22] <obe1> arrenlex, you just do everything in terms of sudo
[05:22] <jumper> buth formatted ext3
[05:22] <obe1> but you  can sudo su -
[05:22] <jumper> both
[05:22] <arrenlex> obe1: Sudo exists so there isn't a root account.
[05:22] <obe1> arrenlex, haha
[05:22] <arrenlex> obe1: You can but it's not recommended. And all sudo su does is grant you root privileges to run with root priveleges.
[05:22] <jumper> finally deleted all partitions but w98 on second drive, pulled drive 1, made drv2 a master and managed install
[05:23] <ubuntu> And now lets see,how to make admin or root account
[05:23] <ubuntu> someone help
[05:23] <arrenlex> obe1: Same as running sudo -i or sudo bash. It just grants you the rights, there is no ACCOUNT.
[05:23] <arrenlex> ubuntu: Why do you need to?
[05:23] <lumaQQ> GAIM question ~ how do i unblock someone who is blocked?    (my computer is in chinese   dont reallt know how to find what im looking for.
[05:23] <obe1> arrenlex, i.e. root privileges mean root account
[05:23] <ubuntu> from the programers of the UBuntu hey tik tak come here.
[05:23] <obe1> root in in /etc/passwd
[05:23] <jumper> now will have to reinstall my master, and edit lilo.conf to hdb 1,0
[05:23] <arrenlex> obe1: Uh... no. o_O
[05:23] <DARKGuy> appye, I don't really know what do you need exactly nor I have much experience in networking under Ubuntu/Linux, but have you tried checking the /etc/networking/interfaces file?
[05:24] <arrenlex> lumaQQ: Not easily. Tools - privacy. Remove the buddy you've pardoned.
[05:24] <ubuntu> Obel man and what i need to search in this directory
[05:24] <obe1> arrenlex, root is the first line in /etc/passwd, and why am i arguing with you
[05:24] <ubuntu> man
[05:24] <ubuntu> OBel
[05:24] <jamesstansell> !java6
[05:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about java6 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:24] <appye> DARKGuy: thanks.  I will check that one.
[05:24] <ubuntu> when i try to enter with root and password
[05:24] <DARKGuy> appye, good luck :)
[05:24] <ubuntu> it told me that the account can enter in this desktop
[05:24] <jamesstansell> can anyone say when sun-java6 will be packaged for Ubuntu?
[05:24] <ubuntu> perdon can't
[05:25] <obe1> ubuntu, how are you searching?
[05:25] <ubuntu> what obel
[05:25] <appye> DARKGuy: nope.  that is not the one.
[05:25] <ubuntu> i'm not searching
[05:25] <danielmarsom> i am needing help with beryl.
[05:25] <DARKGuy> appye, ah, then I can't suggest anything more rather than looking in the files in the /etc/networking/ folder :/
[05:25] <DARKGuy> Brb
[05:26] <ubuntu> switch user then root and password
[05:26] <ubuntu> and told me that the root can't use the desktop.
[05:26] <jamesstansell> !java

[05:26] <tonyyarusso> danielmarsom: Try in #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl
[05:26] <obe1> ubuntu, you are trying to start X with the root user?
[05:26] <jb0nd38372> Is there a graphical ide for the ruby programming language?  I  installed ruby via Synaptic, but cant figure out where or how to start the ide if there is one
[05:27] <ubuntu> obel man i try to log with root account
[05:27] <obe1> ubuntu, you cannot do that
[05:27] <ubuntu> and why root user man
[05:27] <danielmarsom> tonyyarusso, ive tried beryl, goin to xgl now
[05:27] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: did it work?
[05:27] <ubuntu> and why in REd hat it work man.
[05:27] <tonyyarusso> jamesstansell: I doubt it would be backported anyway...could be wrong.
[05:27] <eontasticness> XGL for me wouldnt work in 1400x1050 resolution
[05:27] <appye> DARKGuy: you know how when you go into the "networking" control panel under "administration" ?  On the second tab over, there is a list of ip addresses such as 127.0.0.1, and a bunch of others.  I deleted 127.0.0.1 and when I reopened the applet, I get a bug buddy thing constantly
[05:28] <jamesstansell> I believe there is a ruby project for Eclipse
[05:28] <obe1> on ubuntu, the root password is null, in /etc/shadow, root password is `!' which means one cannot login as root
[05:28] <obe1> directly
[05:28] <DARKGuy> Back
[05:29] <[Ithaycu] > You can set a root password using sudo
[05:29] <Krinkle> ubuntu doesn't boot, all I get is [17179572.880000]  PCI: JMB36x Enabling dual function on 0000:06:00.0   all I changed was I changed the flags on the windows partition to not be hidden. Ideas?
[05:29] <[Ithaycu] > I think?
[05:29] <ubuntu> obel man and what this mean that i can't be root admin in Ubuntu
[05:29] <tonyyarusso> !sudo | ubuntu
[05:29] <ubotu> ubuntu: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:29] <jumper> what 3d desktop is on synpatic that can be used in ubuntu
[05:29] <jamesstansell> tonyyarusso: sun has done the packaging that it will, but I'd prefer to use a deb
[05:29] <appye> DARKGuy: weird.  now it is working miraculously.
[05:29] <DARKGuy> appye, Hm, I'm on Windows right now downloading an alternate install cd, but I can try... some stuff I guess? what is the description of those IP addresses or what's the window/tab you're in about?
[05:29] <DARKGuy> appye, oO weird
[05:30] <appye> i did nothing at all
[05:30] <[Ithaycu] > yes 'sudo passwd' is the command
[05:30] <ubuntu> ubotu thanks man i'm going to the site
[05:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks man i'm going to the site - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:31] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: hold on
[05:31] <jamesstansell> Ruby Development Tools project is at http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/
[05:31] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: I'm reading the bug report to see if there is a fix
[05:31] <obe1> ubuntu, if you are looking to use the root account directly, Ubuntu is not the distribution of linux you should be running
[05:31] <neosa-chris> neone need some assistance?
[05:31] <neosa-chris> quicky assistance
[05:31] <[Ithaycu] > just confirmed that command 'sudo passwd' works
[05:31] <ubuntu> no don't work
[05:31] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: Do you have a Dual Core Proccessor?
[05:32] <[Ithaycu] > The username you create during install is added into the sudo users file
[05:32] <neosa-chris> sudo passwd [user] 
[05:32] <neosa-chris> try that
[05:32] <ubuntu> where to put sudo
[05:32] <neosa-chris> by [user]  i mean put your user account into it
[05:32] <obe1> ubuntu, when you use 'sudo', you enter your user's password, not a 'root' password...
[05:32] <tonyyarusso> [Ithaycu] : We don't really recommend telling people how to set a root password though, since if they don't know how already, they probably don't know what they're doing well enough to understand why it shouldn't be set.
[05:32] <tonyyarusso> Also @ neosa-chris
[05:32] <ubuntu> obel man welcome back
[05:33] <neosa-chris> whats up tony?
[05:33] <jumper> the first item asked in installer is root password :)  then username and his password
[05:33] <[Ithaycu] > tonyyarusso: well I didn't mean to release the genie from the bottle

[05:33] <[Ithaycu] > :0
[05:33] <tonyyarusso> [Ithaycu] : Yeah, it happens :P
[05:33] <ubuntu> obel now i need to write sudo in gnome terminal or not
[05:33] <pkh> can anyone help me to find out shy some services aren't starting at boot (apache2 and mysql)?
[05:33] <neosa-chris> correct. I jumped into the conversation. I was under the impression he was trying ot hcange his own password
[05:33] <pkh> shy->why...
[05:33] <jumper> yup, just installed it a few hours ago
[05:34] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: if you want help you need to answer questions.
[05:34] <tonyyarusso> pkh: Are the scripts to start them in the runlevel's directory?  (ie /etc/rc2.d/)
[05:34] <pkh> the rc?.d Sxxapache2 and Sxxmysql links are present
[05:34] <alexander> guys
[05:34] <pkh> tonyyarusso, yep, they're there
[05:34] <Krinkle> megaqwerty: sorry. Yes I have a C2D processor.
[05:35] <jumper> arrenlex:  what 3d desktop is avaible via synaptic ?
[05:35] <tonyyarusso> pkh: Is there anything in an error log that might be useful?
[05:35] <Megaqwerty> okay...hold on
[05:35] <arrenlex> jumper: What do you mean by 3d desktop?
[05:35] <Mehdi> Hi, i'm going asking this rather Off-Topic question here, mainly because I know this channel has a lot of professionals. I'm a computer science major with one semester left. I want to have a really good "Objective Statement" which I want to place at the top of my resume. I was wondering what you thought about this: "To further my learning and experience of the Computer Science field"
[05:35] <jumper> cube, rotatable desktops etc
[05:35] <alexander> guys how do you start a name in this chat, and then you press something and it like "autofills" itself?
[05:35] <pkh> tonyyarusso, not sure which errorlog to look in...  both start correclty when run from the commandline bia /etc/init.d/xxx start
[05:35] <Krinkle> megaqwerty: I was typing directly to you wasn't I? I didn't just message a lot to someone with a similar name?
[05:35] <Mehdi> If anyone would be so kind as to help me out with it, I would appreciate it a lot
[05:36] <mister_roboto> alexander: use tab to auto-complete
[05:36] <obe1> ubuntu, i am sorry i have no clue what you are trying to do. if you want to run a command as root, in a terminal, type: sudo <command> <arguments>
[05:36] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: oh I'm not logged in for pms, hold on
[05:36] <alexander> mister_roboto, yay!!!! TY ALOT
[05:36] <obe1> ubuntu, then you enter your password
[05:36] <alexander> mister_roboto, im kinda new to all of this :P
[05:36] <mister_roboto> alexander: glad to help :)
[05:36] <alexander> mister_roboto, :)
[05:37] <Megaqwerty> now I am
[05:37] <tonyyarusso> pkh: It may be that a dependency isn't being started far enough ahead of them.  I'd pop into /var/log and just grep for apache and msql
[05:37] <tonyyarusso> mysql
[05:37] <dabaR_> Mehdi: wher do you live?
[05:38] <neosa-chris> welt i hope ya all have good luck..

[05:38] <Mehdi> tony, thank you
[05:38] <pkh> tonyyarusso, nothing obvious -- just the expected stuff -- and all looks like it's normal
[05:38] <Mehdi> dabar: MA, USA
[05:39] <tonyyarusso> pkh: Try renaming the init script to start later and see what happens?
[05:39] <pkh> k, will do
[05:39] <jumper> looking for this, to install via synaptic ?
[05:39] <alexander> hey all.... i got a problem. My internet in firefox is slow. Its not a traffic problem because i checked that already, any specific off hand thoughts?
[05:40] <alexander> anyone?
[05:40] <alexander> ./crickets
[05:42] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: Dude, you need to install Ubuntu Edgy. (6.10)
[05:42] <Krinkle> megaqwerty: I am sorry. I didn't know you had to be logged in to message. I got booted for flooding when I copied and pasted
[05:42] <Megaqwerty> oh
[05:42] <Megaqwerty> that's alright
[05:43] <Megaqwerty> your bug is listed as fixed in Ubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10
[05:43] <Megaqwerty> you may have accidentally installed the 6.06 verison
[05:43] <pkh> tonyyarusso, no good -- still they both don't start --everythign else starts fine!
[05:43] <Megaqwerty> *version
[05:43] <tonyyarusso> pkh: And no logging at all?
[05:43] <tonyyarusso> hmmm
[05:43] <pkh> nothing
[05:44] <Krinkle> okay. that's good. What is edgy? just a different build?
[05:44] <pkh> very frustrating -- like I said they both start perfectly everytime from the commandline post-boot -- and run faultlessly, but on reboot they don't appear -- it;s as if they aren't being started by the boot process.
[05:44] <dee> hallo....
[05:44] <dee> yes......
[05:44] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: It's like what Vista is to XP
[05:44] <Megaqwerty> Krinkle: for Ubuntu
[05:45] <tonyyarusso> pkh: Try poking around with a tool like sysv-rc-conf, disabling and reenabling them
[05:45] <Krinkle> alright. I gotta get to bed. I'll find it tomorrow after work. Thanks for all the help.
[05:45] <Megaqwerty> okay, you're welcome
[05:45] <DARKGuy> Megaqwerty, actually, Feisty Fawn is as Vista is to XP :P
[05:46] <Megaqwerty> DARKGuy: Fine, but it was an example
[05:46] <dee> can I join
[05:46] <dabaR_> !ask
[05:46] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:47] <jumper> I opened 'file browser'  all that is listed is my home, desktop filesystem, floppys and cd/dvd roms
[05:47] <sysdoc> lol, vista is more like a rebaked ME though...
[05:47] <jumper> plugged in usb drive, nothing happened
[05:47] <DARKGuy> Megaqwerty, s'okay xD
[05:47] <jumper> same goes when I plugged in bluetooth
[05:47] <Megaqwerty> ;)
[05:47] <jumper> how do I access all the other partitions on my drives ?
[05:47] <dee> where u come 4
[05:47] <jumper> and usb devices when plugged in ?
[05:48] <jumper> do they not autodetect like other distro's ?
=== inu|sleep is now known as inuyasharenegade
[05:50] <dee> yuu huu...
[05:50] <tonyyarusso> !fstab | jumper
[05:50] <ubotu> jumper: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[05:50] <jumper> should these not all be detected and mounted during install ?
[05:50] <jumper> and when I plug in a usb drive, nothing happens
[05:51] <jumper> same for plug in bluetooth adapter
[05:51] <tonyyarusso> jumper: Generally, yes, they should
[05:51] <billytwowilly> if I'm in synaptic, how do I see which repository a package comes from?
[05:51] <jumper> install should have doen that ?  my bad I guess, expected to "install and use"
[05:52] <jumper> I used pclinuxos last week a few days... in it, when I plugged in a usb device, up came filemanager and I was ready to go ?
[05:53] <jumper> and it is based on ubuntu ?
[05:53] <bimberi> billytwowilly: right-click on a package, Properties, Versions tab
[05:53] <jumper> same for supergamer that I have in another partition, plug in a device and use it
[05:53] <burner> !enter
[05:53] <ubotu> Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[05:54] <jumper> same for puppy linux that I have in yet another aprtition as well as the Xandros that I have used the past 3 years
[05:54] <pkh> tonyyarusso, (or anyone else)  any other ideas where to look for this starting problem -- I've removed all the links, replaced them by hand and through sysv.-rc-conf.  This is unbelievable, it's as if they don't exist!
[05:54] <tonyyarusso> jumper: That's how things work for me - perhaps it's a bug.
[05:54] <billytwowilly> bimberi: so the thing in brackets is the repsoitory it's coming from?
[05:54] <jumper> for me too on the distro's I have installed, and all the live cd's I have tried
[05:54] <tonyyarusso> pkh: Are they missing some config files anywhere, or are any of those misconfigured?  (Prolly not since they start manually, but hey)
[05:55] <tonyyarusso> pkh: Do you have an odd disk setup so maybe something isn't mounted in time?
[05:55] <Mokshu> hi
[05:55] <tonyyarusso> !hi
[05:55] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[05:55] <Mokshu> is there any ubuntu package available for vlc 0.8.6 ?
[05:55] <pkh> tonyyarusso, that's possible (it's actually a vpslink server) but I've placed them after _everything else_
[05:55] <digi|tize> I'm trying to install kubuntu 6.10.1 but the partition editor doesn't recognize the partition on the desired hd, which is an ntfs partition.  the hd info (drive maker and model) loads up, but not the actual partition, as a result i'm unable to resize the partition and setup more partitions for linux.  any ideas?
[05:55] <jrib> Mokshu: that's what is in edgy
[05:56] <tonyyarusso> !info vlc | Mokshu
[05:56] <ubotu> vlc: multimedia player and streamer. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1120 kB, installed size 3240 kB
[05:56] <bimberi> billytwowilly: yes, well actually that and the "Section" on the Common tab.  It will have, for example, "universe" in brackets if applicable.
[05:56] <pkh> tonyyarusso, is there perhaps somewhere I can put '/etc/init.d/apache2 start' so it gets run on startup -- just to see if that gets things started...
[05:56] <Mokshu> jrib: package in edgy is an old svn build nope ?
[05:56] <bimberi> billytwowilly: where it just has nothing in brackets, it's in "main"
[05:56] <Mokshu> !info vlc
[05:56] <ubotu> vlc: multimedia player and streamer. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1120 kB, installed size 3240 kB
[05:56] <GoClick> Why the heck would you meow? What are you seven?
[05:56] <tonyyarusso> pkh: There's bootmisc.sh - you could put a 'sleep' timer in there to put it off further
[05:56] <jrib> Mokshu: october 12th it seems
[05:56] <Mokshu> 12th of october :(
[05:57] <Myria> at work, we have an "HP proliant" blade with 2 woodcrests in it and no hard drive
[05:57] <Mokshu> final 0.8.6 is from a couple of days ago
[05:57] <Myria> we downloaded the server version of ubuntu 6.0.6
[05:57] <Myria> both x86-32 and x86-64
[05:57] <GoClick> This is the official support channel... official channels can't have meowing and barking! This isn't a petting zoo or some kind of vet's office it's a serious technical support tool. TTTTOOOOOOOL
[05:57] <Myria> we followed a series of steps to get it to netboot an image
[05:57] <tonyyarusso> Mokshu: You can request a backport and see if they accept it.  Generally new versions of software after release date are not included.
[05:57] <Myria> we follow the exact same steps for the x86-32 disk and the x86-64 disk, and the x86-64 version doesn't work
[05:58] <cfd90> Help! I can't install squeak :|
[05:58] <Myria> it gives an RPC error 101 when trying to do nfs
[05:58] <cfd90> It says that there is not squeak-vm
[05:58] <cfd90> package
[05:58] <wastrel> squeak eh
[05:58] <arrenlex> GoClick: Considering the number of people who come on here and are like 'ur all gay morons now help me with this stupid crap system lol' I think you should be grateful when they only meow. Stop whining.
[05:58] <cfd90> wastrel, yes, squeak ;0
[05:58] <cfd90> )

[05:58] <wastrel> interesting
[05:58] <tonyyarusso> !info squeak-vm

[05:58] <pkh> tonyyarusso, thanks, will tyr that
[05:58] <jrib> Mokshu: the vlc site has packages for ubuntu
[05:59] <cfd90> Is it for 64 bit?
[05:59] <wastrel> squeak-vm is in multiverse
[05:59] <tonyyarusso> cfd90: Do you have multiverse enabled
[05:59] <tonyyarusso> ?
[05:59] <Myria> what is RPC error 101 with NFS, and why do x86-32 and x86-64 act differently?
[05:59] <cfd90> D'oh, if I update to Edgy do I have to enable it there?
[05:59] <bimberi> as is "squeak" (in multiverse)
[05:59] <wastrel> probably cfd90
[05:59] <cfd90> I can't install squeak
[06:00] <cfd90> squeak: Depends: squeak-vm but it is not installable
[06:00] <jrib> Mokshu: hmm maybe not, their link tricked me
[06:00] <wastrel> cfd90:  enable multiverse, apt-get update; apt-get install squeak squeak-vm
[06:00] <Mokshu> yeah, seels obsolete :(
[06:00] <Mokshu> seems*
[06:00] <wastrel> cfd90:  edgy or dapper?
[06:00] <cfd90> Edgy 64 bit
[06:00] <wastrel> well it's installing on my 32bit edgy
[06:00] <wastrel> dunno...
[06:00] <bimberi> ah, perhaps not for 64bit
[06:00] <klees> can someone help installing proprietary ATI drivers
[06:01] <tonyyarusso> !ati | klees

[06:01] <klees> i downloaded from the ati site
[06:01] <lars30> my os won't boot after installing a SATA drive... edgy/eft
[06:01] <cfd90> Dang it, how do install it then!?! :P
[06:01] <protocol1> is there a way to delete a directory and its contents via console?
[06:01] <lars30> anyone have a good link to why?
[06:01] <arrenlex> klees: Why? It's much easier to grab them from the official repositories.
[06:01] <tonyyarusso> protocol1: Yes, with the rm command
[06:01] <lars30> protocol1: rm -r /path/to/directory
[06:01] <klees> i'm using a 2.6.19.1 kernel
[06:01] <klees> so i need to build modules for that kernel
[06:02] <arrenlex> klees: Where did you get this kernel?
[06:02] <klees> kernel.org
[06:02] <klees> built it
[06:02] <arrenlex> ...ah.
[06:02] <bimberi> cfd90: i386 only :|
[06:02] <lars30> protocol1 rm -rf /path/to/directory if you don't want to type "yes really" a bunch of times.
[06:02] <cfd90> Argh, I have squeak-image and squeak-sources :|
[06:02] <cfd90> :P
[06:02] <bimberi> !chroot | cfd90
[06:02] <ubotu> cfd90: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot use this to build 32 bit environments on a 64 bit box
[06:02] <cfd90> Eh... :P
[06:02] <klees> arrenlex: any way i can use the repo drivers with this kernel?
[06:02] <Myria> what is RPC error 101?  google has way too many things that could cause it
[06:03] <lars30> ubuntu won't boot after installing a Sata drive.. any ideas?
[06:03] <klees> arrenlex: or maybe a repo that can work with custom kernels?
[06:03] <arrenlex> klees: No.
[06:03] <cfd90> Oh well, maybe Seaside and Smalltalk isn't that great...
[06:03] <cfd90> Maybe RoR is better
[06:03] <arrenlex> klees: As to the second, no idea.
[06:03] <protocol1> lars30, with a sudo in front that is  :)
[06:03] <klees> arrenlex: so can u help me troubleshoot the error im getting?
[06:03] <klees> it's failing when building the kernel module
[06:03] <lars30> protocol1: yes.. with a sudo if you dont' have perms on that dir
[06:03] <Scarlet> hi yall
[06:04] <arrenlex> klees: What's the message?
[06:04] <cfd90> 'Lo Scarlet
[06:04] <ThePub> klees: assuming you've built the kernel correctly and left the headers in place, there should be no reason why a build against it should fail.
[06:04] <ThePub> klees: assuming of course, whatever you're trying to build supports the version of kernel you have installed.
[06:05] <Scarlet> I have a toshiba satellite laptop, and ive attempted an install of dapper a couple of times .... it gets to "tell me what size resolution screen you want" then flips out and errors, hense, no installed ubuntu ... what can i do??
[06:05] <klees> ThePub: well i got the latest drivers from the ati site
[06:05] <Scarlet> gday cfd90
[06:05] <jumper> thanks for the help... I'll check out the distro in a few months, perhaps then it will be "install and use"
[06:05] <klees> im trying to paste the log file
[06:05] <protocol1> is it better to extract a .tgz file visually or via console?
[06:06] <arrenlex> klees: Google turned up this pretty thorough walkthrough: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=305665 ...would it help you?
[06:06] <jrib> protocol1: whatever you like
[06:06] <arrenlex> jumper: For everyone other than you, it is. I dunno what happened to you.
[06:06] <floating> Hi. If I type rm * or rm -rf * will it delete everything in ecisting dir and subdirs, or is it going to parent directory and thus be really dangerous ?
[06:06] <protocol1> would the permissions be different?
[06:06] <arrenlex> floating: if you run rm -rf * in the folder /tmp/something, you will end up with a completely empty /tmp/something.
[06:07] <jrib> protocol1: no
[06:07] <protocol1> hmm
[06:07] <bimberi> floating: current dir (and below). not the parent
[06:07] <klees> arrenlex: ThePub:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37113/
[06:07] <floating> ok thanks
[06:07] <meherenOS-X> i have a problem with aim...
[06:07] <arrenlex> klees: I believe you are missing the kernel headers.
[06:07] <La_PaRCa> Question: Did the CC approve the Leadership CoC?

[06:07] <jrib> La_PaRCa: yes, I believe so
[06:08] <arrenlex> klees: The file usr/include/linux/config.h exists?
[06:08] <klees> arrenlex: i created these two files:  linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7_i386.deb  linux-image-2.6.19.1_k7_i386.deb
[06:08] <arrenlex> klees: Because that's what it can't find.
[06:09] <klees> arrenlex: =( that file does not exist
[06:09] <bimberi> itsmabus: groups can't be members of other groups, no
[06:09] <arrenlex> klees: packages.ubuntu.com says that file exists in the linux-kernel-headers package. Dunno if that tells you anything.
[06:09] <klees> arrenlex: i thought i installed linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7_i386.deb
[06:09] <ubox> i have the following evolution error-> Host lookup failed: smtp.gmail.com : Name or service not known
[06:10] <ubox> should i be running an smtp on MY machine?
[06:10] <arrenlex> ..hmm.
[06:10] <arrenlex> Wait, I lie. Hold up.
[06:10] <ubox> pop works fine..i can recieve mail
[06:10] <proqesi> !ntfs
[06:10] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[06:10] <ski-worklap> i want to add control-forward and control-backward to my .inputrc on a remote machine
[06:10] <proqesi> !fuse
[06:10] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[06:11] <ski-worklap> how can i tell what raw keycods gnome-terminal is sending?
[06:11] <bimberi> ubox: no, you don't need a local smtp server.  Check your config against this: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingGmailWithEvolution
[06:11] <ubox> oh ok
[06:11] <arrenlex> klees: My apologies. I was looking at my debian system. Ubuntu puts them in /usr/src/linux-headers-<whatever>/include/linux/config.h	
[06:12] <arrenlex> klees: Do you have THAT?
[06:12] <ski-worklap> don't write ntfs unless you like pain
[06:13] <ubox> bimberi, done that..
[06:13] <ski-worklap> (and have backups too)
[06:13] <arrenlex> klees: Do you absolutely need to have the newest kernel? As you can see it's a pain.
[06:13] <klees> arrenlex: i dont have config.h but i do have a /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.19.1
[06:13] <ski-worklap> apt-cache search headers | grep -e linux -e kernel
[06:14] <ThePub> klees: how'd you install your new kernel?  just download the .tar.gz and build from source?
[06:14] <klees> arrenlex: the latest kernel gives me better performance and gives me Abit uGuru support for hardware monitoring
[06:14] <klees> ThePub: yes
[06:14] <ski-worklap> what on earth is abit uguru?
[06:15] <klees> it's the chip my Abit AN7 motherboard swears by
[06:15] <meherenOS-X> could anyone help me with resetting my aim pass?
[06:15] <meherenOS-X> i don't have access to my alternate email... and ive forgotten my pass
[06:15] <meherenOS-X> how can i reset it?
[06:15] <ubox> bimberi-> anything more i should do?
[06:16] <noiesmo> does anyone know why http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/dists/edgy-plf is unavailable
[06:16] <ski-worklap> meherenOS-X, wow everything about that is offtopic
[06:16] <ski-worklap> ask in #macosx, that will at least be closer
[06:16] <ThePub> klees: did you follow this method?  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[06:16] <meherenOS-X> ski-worklap... yep :p but i have no where else to ask (that i know of)
[06:17] <bimberi> ubox: sorry, that setup is working for me so I'm not sure.  Can you actually ping smtp.gmail.com currently?
[06:17] <meherenOS-X> uum why would #macosx be closer just outa curiosity?
[06:17] <klees> ThePub: no
[06:17] <ThePub> klees: the end result would be proper debs for kernel installation, including headers, etc.. then you could pretty easily build any repo source package :)
[06:17] <klees> ThePub: i did create two deb packages  linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7_i386.deb  linux-image-2.6.19.1_k7_i386.deb
[06:17] <klees> and installed them
[06:17] <meherenOS-X> ski-worklap... besides people here are smart.... heh they might (if im lucky) know the answer
[06:17] <ubox> bimberi-> yep
[06:17] <klees> im under the custom kernel now
[06:19] <bimberi> ubox: hmm, i'm struggling now :|
[06:20] <ubun> what gnome tool should i use as an ftp client?
[06:20] <arrenlex> klees: You should definitely have usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.19-1-k7/include/linux/config.h. Do you?
[06:20] <ubun> filezilla?
[06:20] <klees> arrenlex: i don't
[06:20] <cybermad> do you know what is the best computer inventory for office? web based is ok.. there are OCS NG, phpinventory, phpinv, ZCI, etc  but i don't know which one recommended?
[06:20] <bimberi> ubun: nautilus, the file manager, via Places -> Connect to Server
[06:20] <ubun> oh yeah thanks
[06:21] <arrenlex> klees: Go through that headers package you installed and see if it had a config.h anywhere, I guess.
[06:21] <klees> arrenlex: not in that folder
[06:21] <arrenlex> klees: But anywhere?
[06:22] <klees> arrenlex: can i list what the deb package has?
[06:22] <arrenlex> klees: dpkg -L package
[06:22] <bimberi> ubox: Here ( http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=13287 ) it says to use port 465 or 587 so try that (eg. smtp.gmail.com:465)
[06:22] <arrenlex> | grep  config.h, klees, for simplicity
[06:22] <ubox> oh ok thnks
[06:22] <klees> $ dpkg -L linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7_i386.deb
[06:22] <klees> Package `linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7_i386.deb' is not installed.
[06:22] <klees> hmmm
[06:23] <arrenlex> ...hmm indeed.
[06:23] <arrenlex> Oh. No.
[06:23] <arrenlex> That's a package name.
[06:23] <klees> arrenlex: honestly i did install it
[06:23] <klees> doing it right now
[06:23] <klees> again
[06:23] <arrenlex> klees: It's not a .deb, it's a package name. So dpkg -L linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7
[06:23] <arrenlex> Or whatever its name was.
[06:24] <klees> $ dpkg -L linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7_i386
[06:24] <klees> Package `linux-headers-2.6.19.1_k7_i386' is not installed.

[06:25] <Buzzygirl> Hello!
[06:26] <arrenlex> !hi
[06:26] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:27] <_goofy_> i have a sata disk that i cant read.....it should be a ntfs partition and im running a live cd
[06:27] <klees> arrenlex: i get too many hits with that command
[06:27] <arrenlex> klees: | grep config.h
[06:27] <klees> i did
[06:28] <arrenlex> klees: And there are many matches? o_O
[06:28] <klees> i need it to be just config.h
[06:28] <klees> is returning config.hp etc
[06:29] <feryana> why If I try to zip a file, it skips files? I have a folder with 2484 archive it does only 1200 (tar.gz) or 2100 on zip?
[06:29] <ubun> how can i make so when i press 'alt' in nautilus it will activate a menu without me having to hold down the alt key?
[06:29] <_goofy_> i have a sata disk that i cant read but when i right click it says i have premission to read.....it should be a ntfs partition and im running a live cd
[06:30] <protocol1> is there a reason why I cant apt-get x-window-system-dev? or is it called something else in edgy?
[06:31] <crimsun_> !x-dev
[06:31] <ubotu> x-dev: dummy package for transition purposes. In component main, is optional. Version 7.0.7-1 (edgy), package size 3 kB, installed size 32 kB
[06:31] <protocol1> its called x-dev
[06:31] <imoeth_lutcu> haiiiiiiiii
[06:32] <arrenlex> klees: Oh. | grep /config.h$
[06:32] <arrenlex> protocol1: xlibs-dev
[06:32] <SogniX> hi, there's something wrong with my server's DNS (reverse returns a SERVFAIL error), but I think that it's not logging any errors - all I see in /var/logs/messages is a "--MARK--" but nothing else. Any idea how to turn logging on or what my problem is?
[06:34] <klees> arrenlex: nothing returned
[06:34] <_goofy_> is there a disk ghosting software that will run inside of ubuntu
[06:35] <ubun> wine norton ghost?
[06:36] <arrenlex> klees: I got some hits. Your package does not contain a config.h
[06:36] <imoeth_lutcu> # semarang
[06:36] <RoKFiT> can anyone help me with some audio popping problems?
[06:36] <klees> arrenlex: how can i get that file?
[06:36] <arrenlex> klees: No idea; I've never compiled a custom kernel. = /
[06:37] <lars30> ubuntu no longer boots even from live cd...
[06:37] <protocol1> arrenlex, what is that for?
[06:37] <lars30> windows partition boots fine
[06:37] <lars30> ?
[06:37] <lars30> it just stops right after the bootstrap
[06:37] <arrenlex> protocol1: xlibs-dev? You asked "is there a reason why I cant apt-get x-window-system-dev? or is it called something else in edgy?"
[06:37] <lars30> last message is "boot kernel"
[06:38] <protocol1> oh ok
[06:38] <protocol1> thx
[06:38] <protocol1> I got it
[06:38] <lars30> I can't imagine why LiveCD doesn't run
[06:39] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, good evening
[06:39] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Hiya.
[06:40] <bart_> somone has ubunt u64 bit ? and wine self compiled ?
[06:41] <arrenlex> bart_: I think you're going to find it very difficult to run wine on a 64-bit system, as it is in itself an emulator for 32-bit applications.
[06:41] <bart_> yeah it works without chroot
[06:41] <arrenlex> bart_: You can do it through 32-bit emulation...
[06:41] <bart_> but the language is wrong
[06:42] <arrenlex> Oh. *shrug* no idea.
[06:42] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, well, came home and had to reboot, but at least I got to try the synch, unmount, boot sequence.......
[06:42] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Ah? xD
[06:42] <bart_> and theres no way to run it in my langauge ... i am trying 1 hour with winhq channel users
[06:43] <gary_> has anyone set up aiglx and beryl on dapper? I have it (finally!!!) and whenever i go to shut down or logout the scren freezes. any help?
[06:43] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, it appears I get no visual confirmation that the first two commands in the sequence were actually accomplished?
[06:43] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Not in X. If you go to a console (ctrl+alt+f1) and do them you'll see the kernel prints messages. (press ctrl+alt+f7 to return to X)
[06:44] <Geoffrey2> ah, ok....that's the type of stuff I obviously still need to learn about.....
[06:45] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Try it :) press ctrl+alt+f1 and then press alt+sysrq+s. It'll tell you it synced the systems.
[06:45] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, interestingly, I'd deliberately left absolutely nothing running on my desktop, and still came back to find the computer essentially locked up...it was running, but I couldn't get anything to start up
[06:46] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Is this machine on a network? I'm curious as to whether it's possible to SSH into it in that state.
[06:47] <ibb> how do i find out what version os software i have, in the terminal, lets say what version of nfs i have
[06:47] <bimberi> arrenlex: cool tip! (alt+sysrq+s)
[06:48] <arrenlex> bimberi: It's not very useful by itself. alt+sysrq+k is useful (kills all processes running under you, often allows you to get your computer back if it froze) or alt+sysrq+s,u,b to sync, unmount and reboot in that order... the Linux three finger salute :)
[06:48] <bimberi> ibb: dpkg -l | grep nfs
[06:49] <tx22> I'm using chatzilla, but I don't know how to connect to another server?.. I want to just connect to one particular one but I don't know how, Thanks.
[06:50] <bimberi> arrenlex: nice, thanks
[06:50] <ibb> bimberi, i am using a redhat system
[06:50] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, lesse, I went to tty1, and the screen says 'jeffrey-laptop login: '
[06:50] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Yes. Go there and press alt+sysrq+s and it'll print a message.
[06:50] <bimberi> ibb: my apologies, I stupidly assumed you were using Ubuntu
[06:51] <ibb> bimberi, that is ok, but i just cant find it anywhere
[06:51] <Gandalf> well hello all
[06:52] <arrenlex> Hi Gandalf! :) Show us a magic trick!
[06:52] <bimberi> arrenlex: ;)
[06:52] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, when I did the alt-sysrq-s, it displayed a message with the date stamp, followed by 'SysReq: Emergency Sync'
[06:53] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: Yep. :) Your kernel just said it's first words to you! Awww.
[06:53] <arrenlex> Coochie coochie coo.
[06:53] <SilentDis> 'lo :)
[06:53] <arrenlex> its *
[06:53] <kyawzin> Hi anybody knows how to point a subdomain using A record to point to the server with static IP address?
[06:53] <Geoffrey2> arrenlex, as long as it doesn't say something like "Good Morning Dave, I'm ready for my first lesson."
[06:54] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: I hope not, since your name appears to be Geoffrey.

[06:55] <Gandalf> guess im probably the only person in here who doesnt know how to use linux
[06:56] <SilentDis> and so ends this episode of "pictures of naughty bits by nod3" :D
[06:56] <preaction> has anyone installed Edgy on their MacBook Pro? it's taken 10 minutes to get "12%" of the kernel loaded from the Live CD. Is this normal?
[06:56] <SilentDis> Gandalf:  and that's why we're all here, to help :)
[06:57] <Geoffrey2> Gandalf, well, I'm using Ubuntu....I'm not sure if I really know HOW to use it, I just manage to get the darn thing to work....partially....sometimes.... :)
[06:57] <SilentDis> precation:  how much memory in the machine?
[06:57] <preaction> SilenceGold, 2 gig i believe
[06:57] <preaction> SilenceGold, the boss just kinda maxed the thing out
[06:57] <arrenlex> Gandalf: I'm not using ubuntu, but I hang out here to give people conflicting instructions and crack annoying jokes! :)
[06:57] <tx22> Guys, if I wanted to download a simple file off of the internet with wget and save it to a specific place, what is the actual command?.. Thanks in advance
[06:58] <arrenlex> tx22: wget http://whatever.com/file.zip -O/tmp/hello.zip
[06:58] <Gandalf> my girlfriends uncle built me a computer, and put mepis linux on it and i dont have the heart to tell him i dont know how to use it
[06:58] <SilentDis> preaction:  wow.  that's the most common cause of lockups.  I don't have much experience with mac hardware though.  sorry :(
[06:58] <tx22> arrenlex:  thanks a lot.
[06:58] <Geoffrey2> Gandalf, you see, arrenlex stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night :)
[06:58] <preaction> SilentDis, because it has too much memory? wtf
[06:59] <SilentDis> preaction:  no no lol.  I 'wow'ed at the amount.  on a laptop that's awesome lol.  i am not sure what could be causing it otherwise.
[07:00] <ubuntu> Hi..
[07:00] <preaction> SilentDis, i guess i just wait it out :p
[07:00] <ubuntu> i am installing grub..
[07:00] <tx22> arrenlex:  I'm using windows currently, so for example it would be 'wget http://www.sdf.com/sdf.zip -Oc:/ ?
[07:00] <ubuntu> root (hd0,6) what does tat 0 and 6 referes to
[07:00] <SilentDis> preaction:  does the machine appear frozen?
[07:00] <preaction> SilentDis, no, every few minutes another 4% gets loaded
[07:01] <arrenlex> tx22: For starters, how'd you manage to get wget on windows? cygwin?
[07:01] <Geoffrey2> I really, really, wanna go pretty much Windows free...but first I need to get the hiccups out of Ubuntu on my system, and that's taking a while
[07:01] <preaction> it appeared frozen before, so this time i decided to try waiting
[07:01] <arrenlex> tx22: And if so, no idea. Doesn't cygwin use its own directory structure?
[07:01] <tx22> arrenlex:  it is available under windows
[07:01] <ubuntu> hello some one help me out
[07:01] <ubuntu> root (hd0,6) what does tat 0 and 6 referes to
[07:01] <ubuntu> ???
[07:01] <arrenlex> tx22: Really. Then ... try it I guess? But you need a whole filename on that -O switch.
[07:01] <preaction> SilentDis, the worst thing is I can't hear the CD drive spinning at all. I think it's going at less than 1x atm... bad CD perhaps?
[07:01] <SilentDis> ubuntu:  hard disk 0, partition 6 it sounds like.
[07:02] <arrenlex> tx22: Or else use -P for only a directory.
[07:02] <tx22> arrenlex:  ok thanks
[07:02] <arrenlex> ubuntu: (hd0,6) means the 7th partition of the first drive.
[07:02] <SilentDis> preaction:  that's about the only thing I can think of... as I said, i don't have much knowledge of mac hardware architecture.
[07:03] <preaction> SilentDis, nor i, i'll just keep going and see what happens
[07:03] <SilentDis> preaction:  PPC chip or Intel chip?
[07:03] <ubuntu> arrenlex, i ve lost my grub.. so now how to install..
[07:03] <SilentDis> !grub | ubuntu
[07:03] <ubotu> ubuntu: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[07:03] <ubuntu> arrenlex, i have linux on hda8
[07:03] <preaction> SilentDis, Macbooks are intel
[07:03] <preaction> ubuntu, then you want (hd0,7)
[07:03] <SilentDis> preaction:  again, shows how much I know rofl
[07:03] <arrenlex> ubuntu: in /boot/grub/menu.lst make sure groot is set to (hd0,7).
[07:04] <Ash-Fox> !package
[07:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about package - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:04] <arrenlex> ubuntu: then run sudo update-grub to make sure all your kernels are current, and run sudo grub-install /dev/hda
[07:04] <valehru> HEy guys, I accidentially dropped an entire database in phpmyadmin, is there anyway of recovering it?  seriously in panic mode right now...the comp hasnt been rebooted nor have any new tables or queries been made
[07:04] <ubuntu> arrenlex, /dev/hda ?
[07:04] <ubuntu> should i give any no there!!
[07:05] <arrenlex> ubuntu: Assuming you want to install grub to the MBR of the first drive, yes, install it to /dev/hda.
[07:05] <ubuntu> arrenlex, i mean no need to specify any numbers!
[07:05] <Gunny> Hey fellas. Do you know why 'apt-get install sendmail' doesn't work. Doesn't aptitude have sendmail as a standard pkg?
[07:05] <SilentDis> valehru:  if it was in the web-based script thingy... i think it's dead, jim.
[07:05] <arrenlex> ubuntu: When you install grub, no. In the grub configuration file, yes.
[07:05] <rredd4> using dapper, grub will not load (sometimes it does).  sometimes have to reboot a lot to get it to work.  reinstall or what?
[07:05] <SilentDis> !info sendmail
[07:05] <preaction> Gunny, try apt-cache search sendmail
[07:05] <ubotu> sendmail: powerful, efficient, and scalable Mail Transport Agent. In component universe, is extra. Version 8.13.8-2 (edgy), package size 191 kB, installed size 248 kB
[07:06] <valehru> SilenceDis, yeah, it was in phpmyadmin
[07:06] <pkh_> does anyone know the location of a how-to for installing aiglz/beryl on feisty?
=== selzy_imut is now known as ngantukan
[07:06] <Gunny> I don't see 'sendmail' in there. JJust exim, postfix, and the sendmail perl module...
[07:06] <SilentDis> phk_:  I just saw a post on that on planet ubuntu... one moment.
[07:06] <ToastBusters> Hey guys, I'm having a problem with my display. I have a dual  monitor setup, and on one of the screens, there is a vertical bar that is outside the normal viewing area. The monitor is auto-aligning to include this, which means that entire section of the screen is unusable.
[07:07] <Gunny> I'm running the latest Edgy server
[07:07] <SilentDis> phk_: http://www.simplifiedcomplexity.com/people/mgalvin/?p=12
[07:07] <pkh_> SilentDis, awesome, thanks
[07:08] <jb0nd38372> Is there a way to edit screensaver prefrences in edgy, I know the default screensaver dameon has no visible way to set prefs, just wondering if there was some type of option to enable them
[07:08] <SilentDis> phk_: Liferea is my friend :)
[07:08] <ToastBusters> anyone?
[07:09] <SilentDis> jb0nd38372:  not sure... i remember seeing a post about using xscreensaver package with a particular setup to change the options under dapper... no idea if something like that would work under edgy.   :(
[07:10] <Gunny> I havn't made a server from debian in a while, and I'm used to Gentoo now which has every package under the sun
[07:10] <Gunny> SUrprised if Ubuntu doesn't have sendmail...
[07:10] <SilentDis> ToastBusters:  i haven't setup dual monitors yet, and haven't seen something like that.  not to say this room can't help, though.  give it a few minutes for others to pop in, and ask again :)
[07:10] <ToastBusters> Okay, I'll ask again in a bit
[07:10] <jb0nd38372> SilentDis: yeah I saw on ubuntu forums had a post to instalkl the xscreensaver dameon and disable the gnome one, I dont mind doing that, just didn't want to use any extra memory or resources if possible
[07:11] <rredd4> grub help please...
[07:11] <SilentDis> !grub | rredd4
[07:11] <ubotu> rredd4: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[07:11] <SilentDis> Gunny:  it's in the Email (universe) repository
[07:12] <nnutter> I am unfamiliar with the current state of Xorg and dual displays. I have a laptop with Intel 945GM chipset. I want to use Beryl if possible and be able to hook my laptop up to a TV or projector for movies/presentations. What might be the best way to do this? I have heard you can do two displays in X, also I have heard of Xinerama, Twinhead, mergefb, but I don't know what all the differences are.
[07:12] <SilentDis> gunny:  so, you shouldn't have to muck with sources.list... not sure why it's not showing up for you
[07:12] <rredd4> SilenDis  ty, should i reinstall grub, will only load sometimes.  I did not load windows afterwards
[07:12] <SilentDis> rredd4:  depends on what the problem is.  what happened?
[07:13] <SilentDis> rredd4:  so, sometimes your box brings up the grub bootloader, sometimes it gives you some sort of error?
[07:13] <rredd4> SilenDis  I am not sure what caused it,  no error
[07:13] <Gunny> k, I'll fiddle
[07:13] <rredd4> just won't load
[07:13] <rredd4> blank screen
[07:13] <cld2> anyone know how to get the ipw2200 intel wlan card working? do i just install wireless-tools and copy the firmware from /lib/firmware/uname to /lib/firmware ?
[07:14] <rredd4> SilentDis other times it works great... hit and miss
[07:14] <SilentDis> rredd4:  you said it works intermittantly.  what happens when it doesn't work?  just a blank screen or some such?
[07:14] <rredd4> yes
[07:14] <rredd4> blank
[07:14] <arrenlex> rredd4: When that happens, does grub even load?
[07:15] <rredd4> SilentDis just before the grub menu loads, no grub does not load
[07:15] <rredd4> it is now that way
[07:15] <SilentDis> rredd4:  hmm... IDE timeout or some other strange weirdness?  no idea really, sorry :(
[07:15] <rredd4> I am on my laptop
[07:15] <rredd4> SilentDis was going to reinstall grub with the alternate cd..
[07:16] <rredd4> thought there might be something else
[07:16] <rredd4> ty
[07:16] <max_> does anyone know of a program that can download mulpiple links off a webpage? (picture links off fourms)?
[07:16] <SilentDis> rredd4:  that can't hurt. not sure what to suggest...
[07:16] <rredd4> SilentDis  maybe when I changed to CE edition?
[07:16] <arrenlex> max_: If you use firefox, you can use the downloadthemall extension.
[07:17] <SilentDis> max_:  you're looking for wget
[07:17] <SilentDis> !wget | max_
[07:17] <ubotu> wget: retrieves files from the web. In component main, is standard. Version 1.10.2-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 226 kB, installed size 1952 kB
[07:17] <bkudria> i want to use the horizonatl titl feature on the wheel of my logitech mx610 mouse, and all the guides say to use evdev.  however, anythign i try causes X to crash.  my xorg.conf file, and the error output is here: http://pastebin.ca/279672 Can anyone shed any light on the problem?
[07:17] <arrenlex> max_: Sorry, that's "downthemall"
[07:17] <SilentDis> max_:  do man wget from a prompt, and check out all the pretty examples at the bottom, wget is really easy to use :)
[07:17] <max_> SilentDis: is wget the same as kget for kubuntu?
[07:17] <SilentDis> !kget
[07:17] <ubotu> kget: download manager for KDE. In component universe, is optional. Version 4:3.5.5-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 431 kB, installed size 1176 kB
[07:17] <arrenlex> max_: Wget is a command line app.
[07:18] <arrenlex> max_: Functionally, however, they are both download managers.
[07:18] <max_> ok, thanks
[07:18] <SilentDis> max_:  i'm going to assume kget is a frontend to it or some such.
[07:18] <rredd4> is there a way to avoid having to go through the disk format routine on the alternate cd to reinstall grub?
[07:18] <Gunny> SilentDis: Oops, forgott to uncomment universe repos
[07:18] <Gunny> Thanks :P
[07:18] <arrenlex> SilentDis: Why not? :( KDE is life.
[07:19] <SilentDis> arrenlex:  i'm on dialup (no other options available to my corner of bumfsck, nowhere), and the download is 30mb or so (glad I picked up both ubuntu and kubuntu DVDs from amazon at least :P)
[07:20] <SilentDis> gunny:  yay, you're an apt-get update and apt-get install sendmail away then :)
[07:20] <arrenlex> SilentDis: If you have the kubuntu DVD you can use apt-cdrom to mount it as a repository and use it to install kde packages.
[07:20] <Gunny> Yeah, I did :D
[07:20] <SilentDis> arrenlex:  already did that ;)  when I apt-get install kubuntu-desktop, it'll need to grab all the updates (which i've already done for ubuntu), which totals to 30mb.
[07:21] <arrenlex> SilentDis: Well you don't really NEED updates... they're mostly bugfixes I'm assuming.
[07:21] <SilentDis> arrenlex:  it's just a matter of time before I decide to do it whilst i sleep sometime rofl
[07:21] <Gunny> Hey, quick question while I'm here. I've opted to use the 32bit ubuntu edgy server on my new 1U box. It has 4GB of memory. Am I going to run into issues?
[07:21] <SilentDis> arrenlex:  or, more likely, when i'm at work :)
[07:22] <Gunny> or should I really be using the 64bit version
[07:22] <Gunny> (Core 2 Duo)
=== _sword-- is now known as sword--
[07:22] <SilentDis> Gunny:  shouldn't have an issue.  from what I keep hearing, the 64 bit versions tend to end up being a bit more trouble than the performance boost is worth :P
[07:22] <cafuego_> Gunny: You'll be fine.
[07:22] <ToastBusters> I'm having a problem with my display. I have a dual  monitor setup, and on one of the screens, there is a vertical bar that is outside the normal viewing area. The monitor is auto-aligning to include this, which means that entire section of the screen is unusable. The second display doesn't seem to be having any issues though, and I'm using nvidia proprietary driver. (not sure if the fact that I'm using two displays is even related to the problem)
[07:23] <Gunny> Some OS's can have trouble at 4GB since that's the 32bit limit
[07:23] <cafuego_> Gunny: yes, but Linux is less retarded than most other OSes in that regard :-)
[07:23] <Gunny> Yes, I know :)
[07:23] <Gunny> It supports both quite well
[07:24] <cafuego_> Gunny: The 64bit version would theoretically give you better performance on computing intensive tasks
[07:24] <cafuego_> Gunny: say large sql queries, that kind of stuff
[07:24] <Gunny> Yeah
[07:24] <Gunny> It'll be an apache/mysql box
[07:24] <SilentDis> gunny:  do i dare ask how large?
[07:24] <Gunny> FOr hordes of users
[07:24] <Gunny> Looking for 1000 concurrent
[07:24] <SilentDis> gunny:  ahhh lol
[07:24] <Gunny> DB is 700MB with no users :o
[07:25] <cafuego_> SilentDis: 64bit in the dame way an Athlon64 is :-)
[07:25] <Gunny> And it's going to be 700KM (7 hour) drive away
[07:25] <SilentDis> i so badly need to build a new 'puter lol
[07:25] <Gunny> So it needs to be rock hard
[07:25] <bioticpro> I just moved a drive from A to B location, changed lilo and fstab, but the block devices all are still called hdb#, can I just rename them, or do I have to remake them?
[07:25] <bioticpro> I mean from B to A
[07:25] <cafuego_> SilentDis: I built a nice core 2 duo for my wife last week
[07:25] <arrenlex> Gunny: There's some imagery I've never associated with computers.
[07:25] <kuto> hi all
[07:25] <cafuego_> SilentDis: surprisingly cheap
[07:25] <kuto> w00t
[07:25] <Gunny> Yeah
[07:26] <SilentDis> cafuego_:  i'm limping along on an Athlon XP 1900+ here :P
[07:26] <cafuego_> SilentDis: this one is replacing an athlon2400+
[07:26] <arrenlex> model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3800+
[07:26] <Gunny> This 1U server was only $1500CND ($1300USD)
[07:26] <SilentDis> cafuego_:  wouldn't be so bad, actually... if it wasn't sitting on a VIA chipset mobo (abit kr7a).  linux brings to the forefront all the little instabilities of this board :P
[07:26] <Gunny> And it's 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo with 4GB of DDR2-800 and 350GB RAID-1
[07:26] <Gunny> With case
[07:27] <cafuego_> SilentDis: Hmmyeah... I preferred my kt400 mobo (but that caught fire)
[07:27] <LookTJ> Where is a site that recommend hardware for Linux because I'm planning on building myself a pc
[07:27] <SilentDis> lol!
[07:27] <Gunny> Annoying thing is I had to install Egdy
[07:27] <ThePub> LookTJ: just buy a mac :D
[07:27] <Gunny> Edgy, instead of LTS
[07:27] <kuto> k00lies
[07:27] <LookTJ> ThePub: why a mac?
[07:27] <Gunny> Edgy doesn't support most of the new COre 2 Motherboards
[07:27] <tombow> speaking of racks, are there any cheap small racks (4 to 8u)?
[07:28] <Gunny> Erm, LTS I mean
[07:28] <SilentDis> LookTJ:  the only things you really have to worry about is 1-nvidia graphics card (way easier, is all), 1gb+ ram, decent hd.  everything else should be exceptionally close to 'just works' :)
[07:28] <ThePub> LookTJ: unixy goodness, more consistent desktop experience :D
[07:28] <cafuego_> SilentDis: http://www.cafuego.net/pix/melty_kahlua.png
[07:28] <Gunny> tombow: Where are you located?
[07:28] <Gunny> Or do you care?
[07:28] <cafuego_> oh sorry, it's in /, not in /pix
[07:28] <SilentDis> cafuego_:  404
[07:29] <SilentDis> cafuego_: got it :)
[07:29] <SilentDis> cafuego_:  how did you do that rofl
[07:29] <Gunny> You can get a 22U rack for $325 a month where I host
[07:29] <LookTJ> ThePub: recommend me a mac because I'm not familer with Macs.
[07:29] <cafuego_> SilentDis: shitty PSU
[07:29] <Gunny> with 500GB/m
[07:29] <SilentDis> cafuego_:  worst I ever did was leaving an int modem plugged into my P75 and it taking a strike.  I was able to trace PCI paths from the black etchings hehe
[07:29] <Gunny> $145 for 4U
[07:30] <Gunny> And $69 for 1U
[07:30] <cafuego_> SilentDis: <heh>
[07:30] <Gunny> Same bandwidth (which is dumb)
[07:31] <SilentDis> cafuego_: ok, what brand PSU, so I know to stay way the hell away from that brand when I buy?  rofl
[07:31] <cafuego_> SilentDis: noname oem
[07:31] <kuto> hi all
[07:31] <cafuego_> AVOID!!!
[07:31] <Gunny> PSU is one of the most important parts
[07:31] <Gunny> Never cheap out
[07:31] <LookTJ> ThePub: What kind of mac should I get?
[07:31] <Gunny> Most computer stability issues are because of bad power flow from a PSU
[07:31] <ThePub> LookTJ: modtly kidding :)
[07:32] <SilentDis> cafuego_: ah yes, i stay away from most all no-name stuff, so no worries there :)
[07:32] <Gunny> Antec and Enermax are usually a good bet
[07:32] <LookTJ> ThePub: you confused me
[07:32] <Gunny> PSU's are getting retarded now
[07:32] <Gunny> There are 1KW PSU's out now
[07:32] <harry> is there a media player in ubuntu that supports MKV files?
[07:32] <Gunny> Can you say "I need utilities included!"
[07:32] <SilentDis> gunny:  I was actually gonna go Antec for case/psu.  still debating over intel/amd for my processor though.  cooling has always been my sticking point... so I'm leaning intel right now :P
[07:33] <arrenlex> harry: Which are what, exactly?
[07:33] <Gunny> Intel is faster, cheaper, and it runs cold
[07:33] <cafuego_> matroska; embedded streams with some metadata
[07:33] <Gunny> I was an AMD fanboy until the Core 2 Duos
[07:33] <cafuego_> Gunny: My amd64 actually runs cooler than the core 2 duo
[07:33] <Gunny> I put 2 instances of CPUBurn on my box for 2 hours
[07:33] <Gunny> Touched the heatsink, and it was cold
[07:33] <Gunny> Really?
[07:34] <Gunny> AMD's are usually heat whores
[07:34] <cafuego_> Gunny: yup!
[07:34] <SilentDis> gunny:  was also thinking of doing the whole 'near-silent pc' thing and getting a watercool system... still to expensive though :P
[07:34] <Gunny> Musta fixed it recently
[07:34] <harry> arrenlex: i mean. i downloaded a movie and the file extension is .mkv, i could play it in mplayer but there is no subs
[07:34] <cafuego_> Gunny: Not the A64 range, not at all.
[07:34] <bioticpro> Can anybody help with explaining how to change block devices?
[07:34] <Gunny> HO well do they overclock?
[07:34] <arrenlex> harry: Oh, so you're not actually looking to play that file, but subtitles?
[07:34] <Gunny> I have a friend that got his Core 2 Duo over 5GHz per core (stable)
[07:34] <cafuego_> Gunny: no idea, I prefer to not blow stuff up or set it on fire.
[07:35] <Gunny> Me neither, but that says something about heat though
=== Pengo is now known as Hit3k
[07:35] <harry> arrenlex: as i said, it runs on mplayer, i could watch the movie, but there are no subtitles
[07:35] <arrenlex> harry: Never used subtitles in mplayer, sorry.
[07:35] <bioticpro> harry, have you tried VLC player?
[07:35] <harry> bioticpro: havent
[07:36] <SilentDis> er, boss
[07:36] <arrenlex> SilentDis: That's not allowed. You have to follow the IRC rules.
[07:36] <SilentDis> ?
[07:36] <kling0n> harry: rename the subtitle file to the same filename as the movie file (except the extension.. that should be srt or whatever) and try again
[07:36] <bioticpro> harry, I always try that if mplayer and xine don't do what I want
[07:36] <arrenlex> SilentDis: Chapter 5, Section 9: On IRC, the men are men, the women are men, and the little girls are FBI agents.
[07:36] <kling0n> harry: or load the sub file manually
[07:37] <SilentDis> O.O
[07:37] <Gunny> Haha
[07:37] <SilentDis> my deepest apologies for disclosing my gender here *hides*
[07:37] <Gunny> Did you ever see that real life chat video?
[07:37] <harry> bioticpro: you try to run it on VLC?
[07:37] <harry> kling0n: there is no subtitle file
[07:38] <SilentDis> does it help that I'm currently listening to the Mighty Mighty Bosstones version of "Sweet Emotion"?
[07:38] <kling0n> harry well, thats you problem then isn't it?
[07:38] <kling0n> *your*
[07:38] <gdb> I'm curious, if you remove a repository from apt's list, is there a command you can run to remove any and all packages that are not longer available?
[07:38] <SilentDis> gdb:  yep:  sudo apt-get update :)
[07:38] <bioticpro> harry, I don't know the file you are doing, try yourself
[07:38] <harry> kling0n: i only have the .mkv itself. whenever i play it on mkv player on windows there are subtitles
[07:38] <kling0n> harry: hmm
[07:39] <gdb> SilentDis: No, I mean remove / purge the unavilable packages from your system, not from apt's package cache.
[07:39] <kling0n> harry: http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/source.html
[07:39] <gdb> For example, say I add a rep for foo, and then install foo.  I then deconfigure the foo repo, is there a generic command that will remove foo because it's no longer available, without specifically removing it by name?
[07:40] <kling0n> you should be able to specify subtitle index on cmdline
[07:40] <kling0n> harry: if you're using gmplayer, you should be able to right-click on the movie window and select subtitle track
[07:40] <kuto> w00t
[07:41] <ubox> i get error msg whne trying to send mail from evolution

[07:42] <kling0n> ubox have you configured evolution to use local sendmail? or an external smtp?
[07:42] <ootput> sorry, should've done that in a priv message
[07:42] <ubox> klingOn: so i have to start smtp on my machine?
[07:43] <ubox> klingOn: it is configured to use an external smtp?
[07:43] <ubox> klingOn: it is configured to use an external smtp!
[07:43] <kling0n> ubox: not necessarily... but if you've configured evolution to send through local sendmail and it isn't running, then that is your problem... you can then wither choose to re-configure it to use your ISP smtp server or chekc that sendmail is installed and running

[07:48] <pwuertz> hi, is there a way to update gnome on edgy to a newer version? are there any repositories?
[07:48] <pwuertz> edgys gnome version is too buggy
[07:48] <cafuego_> And you think a newer unstable version would have LESS bugs?
[07:49] <pwuertz> gnome 2.16 is stable, right?
[07:49] <cafuego_> MS says Windows 98 is stable ;-)
[07:49] <pwuertz> cafuego: 2.16.1 is used in edgy.... why do you think the gnome guys released 2.16.3 ?
[07:49] <cafuego_> 2.16.1 has some oddities, but seems okay from where I'm sitting.
[07:50] <medic30420> why not just apt-get install kubuntu-desktop?
[07:50] <cafuego_> pwuertz: You could try Feisty, or backport the feisty packages...
[07:50] <cafuego_> but I doubt you'll get improved stability
[07:50] <pwuertz> yea... i could... but I asked if there is a known way to improve stability on edgy
[07:50] <pwuertz> like adding a repository
[07:51] <cafuego_> pwuertz: "unlikely"
[07:52] <pwuertz> i got 2 bugs that hurt... 1st... edgy is unable to print certain png files because they are getting all black when converting to postscript
[07:52] <medic30420> pwuertz, i upgraded to edgy, didn't like it because of the gnome issues (at least i think that is where the bugs lie) and then downgraded back to dapper, very happy now
[07:52] <somerville32> medic30420, How do you "downgrade"?
[07:52] <pwuertz> 2nd... gstreamer - gnomevfs doesnt work with smb anymore... worked in dapper
[07:53] <kling0n> pwuertz: works for me
[07:54] <medic30420> well, for me I actually copied my /home/ folder to another harddisk, wiped everthing, and installed dapper, mounting the backup of home under another folder and copied everything i needed
[07:54] <pwuertz> kling0n, its a unresolved bug in edgy... maybe you are using another player
[07:54] <kling0n> pwuertz: i use mainly totem and mplayer and try to stay on xine backends
[07:54] <medic30420> i wanted to install tripwire anyways
[07:54] <kling0n> pwuertz: so you might be right :)
[07:54] <pwuertz> i know :)
[07:55] <kling0n> pwuertz: I ended up mounting as CIFS  in stead of over smb though
[07:55] <pwuertz> to be more specific... its a bug in gnome that is resolved in a later gnome version
[07:55] <pwuertz> kling0n, i dont like mounting network shares... its unsafe and a bad concept
[07:56] <kling0n> not with cifs and IPSEC :)
[07:56] <kling0n> pwuertz: still working on the IPSEC though :)
[07:56] <pwuertz> with unsafe I mean: mount a network share... use it.... unplug the network... and your whole cifs/smb subsystem dies
[07:56] <pwuertz> you cannot unmount the dead shares
[07:57] <pwuertz> and several programs will freeze forever because they might try to access the folder
[07:57] <pwuertz> like "mount" or "df"
[07:57] <cr4ftyb0n35> Hello all. A general question. I have a serial device, to which I need to send certain bytes to. How would I do this? I've tried minicom, I've tried catting, but somehow it isn't going through
[07:58] <pwuertz> or just a nautilus trying to collect informations about mounted media
[07:58] <upshs01> upshs01join

[07:59] <ubotu> Gunny: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[07:59] <kling0n> pwuertz: my shares don't die )
[08:00] <Gunny> :P, okay later ;)
[08:00] <kling0n> pwuertz: and CIFS will recover even if something times out
[08:00] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35, kermit is another good program
[08:01] <pwuertz> kling0n, well not for me... so you see its unstable
[08:01] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmc: something just doesn't work. Is there a way I can check traffic over the serial port?
[08:01] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmc: I tried kermit I believe...
[08:01] <pmcnabb> usually when someone has trouble it's because the wrong device is selected
[08:02] <pwuertz> kling0n, also... sometimes you cant unmount shares because they are "in use" and you cant determine why
[08:02] <pmcnabb> or for some reason there's restrictive permissions on the right device
[08:03] <pmcnabb> cr4fty, i'm looking for my config file...
[08:04] <pmcnabb> i've used it on some switches recently

[08:06] <ootput> hi guys, which log file in /var/log/ does dmesg actually send to stdout?
[08:06] <ootput> I'm trying to 'tail' the output
[08:07] <Myria> what is RPC error 101 when trying to use NFS?
[08:07] <surekha> I get the following error....  update-alternatives: Cannot find alternative `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/bin/javac'
[08:07] <pmcnabb> ootput, try /var/log/kern.log
[08:07] <pmcnabb> (or kern.log.0)

[08:09] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: yes
[08:09] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: the device has been used over windows, and I looked at a utility that tells me what bytes to send over. A simple reset request should work, neverthless...
[08:10] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35, on the several machines i've tried, it was always /dev/ttyS0

[08:11] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35, also, to send binary, use the xmodem option

[08:11] <ubox> klingOn:gmail-smtp.l.google.com works fine
[08:13] <pmcnabb> surekha, what does 'update-java-alternatives -l' return?
[08:14] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: alright
[08:14] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35, you may have to use zmodem or ymodem, but try x- first
[08:17] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: I get a failure executing protocol
[08:17] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: that was using xmodem
[08:17] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: ditto for all the others
[08:18] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: for kermit, I get this strange thing where it says sending file, dumps the contents of something(possibly the file) onto the screen and just sits there hung
[08:18] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35, can you send hangup to the device and try again?
[08:18] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: yeah same result
[08:19] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35: i was just doing it on cisco switches the other day and it ran pretty smoothly (albeit quite slow) :)
[08:19] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35: what type of device is it?

[08:31] <pmcnabb> cr4ftyb0n35, when you run kermit from inside minicom?
[08:32] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: yeah
[08:32] <pmcnabb> it keeps minicom's settings
[08:32] <cr4ftyb0n35> pmcnabb: hmm, baud rate == packet length?

[08:38] <Red-Sox[away] > Paavo: so f = path?
[08:39] <Myria> my friend figured out the NFS RPC problem...  when netbooting, he says you have to disable DHCP in the OS
[08:39] <Myria> i guess that makes sense, because netbooting has DHCP done already by the BIOS
[08:39] <jamesstansell> RichEd: maybe picking it up from a DHCP server?
[08:39] <Myria> ...
[08:40] <Myria> sorry i didn't mean to say something unrelated about DHCP that might confuse people talking about something else.
[08:40] <RichEd> jamesstansell: ah ... perhaps it may be my wireless network device ?
[08:41] <RichEd> jamesstansell: what exactly is that setting used for "search domains"
[08:45] <Paavo> Red-Sox[away] : no, f is the loop variable
[08:45] <jamesstansell> RichEd: it's for DNS lookups, to specify more than one domain to try.

[08:48] <Red-Sox[away] > thanks
[08:48] <jamesstansell> Red-Sox[away] : you can also use the -d option to unzip to tell it which directory to target
[08:48] <ootput> hi guys, any of you using gaim-irchelper, and have time to address a couple of my questions? :)
[08:48] <Paavo> if you want the current directory to remain the same after that, you can use a subshell:
[08:49] <spacepod> i'm having a problem with gsambad everytime i attempt to restart it or stop it i get an error dialog saying "winbind failed" any help would be great
[08:49] <Paavo> (cd /home/jonny/docs; for f in *.zip; do unzip $f; done)
[08:49] <M3L7down> ootput: I might be able to, whats your problem?
[08:49] <Paavo> Red-Sox[away] : if you put a command in parenthesis, it's run in a subshell, and its variable assignments and current directory changes don't propagate to the parent shell
[08:50] <ootput> M3L7down: thanks mate. My first question is: how on earth do i use it? I've installed it through synaptic, but I can't see any way to configure it (i.e, I can't find the support docs offline or online.) Also, there isn't any configure screen in gaim's plugins window
[08:51] <ootput> M3L7down: and I suppose my other question(s) would be a repeat of my first :D
[08:51] <irawan> is there any good easy tutorial for gnucash?
[08:51] <ootput> M3L7down: an unrelated question: is there a history-scroll-back feature in irc chat windows?

[08:54] <ootput> M3L7down: yeah, strictly gaim. I used to be an avid user of irssi, until I figured out that I liked the new gaim better, and it did what I needed it to do well (well mostly, besides this nag of mine)
[08:55] <ootput> M3L7down: yeah, gaim irc is what I'm after
[08:55] <M3L7down> ootput: in IRC look up to options, and hit enable logging
[08:55] <M3L7down> ootput: then, go to conversation, and hit view log
[08:55] <M3L7down> ootput: is that what you are looking for?

[08:57] <ootput> hehe, not quite. Essentially, I'd like to be able to cross-post (do a little forum->irc translation there,) b/w channel windows, and avoid having to resort to copy-paste
[08:58] <M3L7down> ootput: I will check that out
[08:58] <ootput> Catfish_man and Kingant appear to be quite engrossed in their conversation in #gaim, so I thought it'd be fun to expose my problems (in Gaim) to the kind-hearted folk at #ubuntu

[09:38] <shiner421> I cant use the ones from nvidia.com cause I cant figure out how to shut down the xserver

[09:40] <Tomcat_> shiner421: They are optimized for certain CPUs.
[09:40] <ubotu> shiner421: envy is a Python script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy

[09:41] <Tomcat_> shiner421: But for me, they didn't make any difference... 386/generic is alright. :o

[09:41] <ootput> shiner421: likewise, never found 686 to be better than generic for my athlonxp

[09:42] <ootput> you don't need the apostrophe
[09:42] <ootput> er, exclamation mark

[09:46] <Kleggas> Hi. I have an Acer 5100 with a realtek 7.1 capable sound card that just do not work. I had it fully working after installing edgy, then I installed ati drivers and the sound crapped out, only standard 2.0 sound without mic. today I noticed the new kernel and hoped for this to fix my problem so I made an dist-upgrade and now I have no sound at all. How can I get rid of the sound drivers in fglrx in ubuntu repositories so it can use alsa to
[09:46] <Kleggas> give me both audio and video working. OR, if thats not possible, how can I fix ANY sound at ALL? or which distro does support alc880 sound together with fglrx?
[09:47] <shiner421> I keep getting the warning the following packages cannot be authenticated, is that bad?
[09:47] <defrysk> shiner421, not bad just a pain
[09:48] <shiner421> k
[09:48] <Tomcat_> shiner421: It doesn't guarantee that the package comes from the correct person, but it's usually alright.
[09:48] <ootput> shiner421: depending on the package, you should be able to get it authenticated
[09:48] <defrysk> you need to dset up the gpg key
[09:49] <cge> I want to push a sine wave of around 440Hz out of my sound card. Is there a simple way to do so?

[10:15] <KenSentMe> mixa: it's a guide for newbie ubuntu users
[10:15] <noiesmo> !iptables |ehab
[10:15] <ubotu> ehab: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[10:15] <wickedly_cool> does everyone like 6.10 better than 6.06?
[10:16] <KenSentMe> wickedly_cool: for my desktop i do, but for my server i like dapper better
[10:16] <ehab> ubotu: it gives me upgrade iptables or kernel why
[10:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about it gives me upgrade iptables or kernel why - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:16] <n0yd> No one can tell me where ubuntu's sudo pkg gets its config by default?
[10:16] <KenSentMe> ehab: ubotu is a bot
[10:17] <Jordan_U_> n0yd: I am not sure I understand your question, could you rephrase it?
[10:17] <wickedly_cool> yeah i am thinking about going to 6.10 cause 6.06 is a little buggy not bad though just a little
[10:17] <n0yd> Jordan_U_: Does Ubuntu's sudo pkg not use /etc/sudoers by default?  There isn't a section to enable sudo for my user (Although sudo obviously works), and  generally sudo uses /etc/sudoers to grant sudo access to users like "user ALL=(ALL) ALL)

[10:19] <umar> how can we suppress root password in general user.....as ubuntu live cd does
[10:19] <ootput> but i still prefer 6.10
[10:19] <n0yd> Jordan_U_: Apparently it's pulling a config from somewhere else in Ubuntu, unlike the daefult sudo installation from a src tarball for example
[10:19] <cyphase> via gnome-user-share or something
[10:19] <ehab> noiesmd: i can run the problem when i upgraded the kernel i use sarge i upgraded the kernel to 2.6.18 the fire wall gives me ere when i type $iptables -L

[10:20] <wickedly_cool> yeah i was thinking since 6.10 is so new it is bound to have a lot of bugs... but doesnt every OS?
[10:20] <ehab> dam no thats new
[10:20] <ehab> cool script

[10:21] <niru> how to suppress root password in a general user
[10:22] <n0yd> Jordan_U_: Look at yours, it doesn't specify acces for users in /etc/sudoers, and it's kind of annoying, because I want to enable a passwordless sudo access for a certain user
[10:22] <niru> any help
[10:22] <niru> n0yd:any help
[10:22] <niru> how to suppress root password in a general user
[10:22] <n0yd> niru: suppress? Can you rephrase that
[10:22] <SilverTab> anyone got ndiswrapper to work in edgy?? it was working well in dapper but no luck in edgy so far...
[10:23] <niru> I dont want to  type root password when I am a general user
[10:23] <cmt^^> Is there any good DC++-client for ubuntu edgy? linuxdcpp is buggy as hell
[10:23] <SilverTab> I tried with both my WUSB54GC and my DWL-G132...and it just wont work
[10:23] <n0yd> niru: You mean for sudo? You want a passwordless sudo?
[10:23] <niru> n0yd:yes
[10:23] <ehab> all: i need help
[10:23] <niru> is it possible
[10:23] <niru> yes n0yd
[10:23] <Jordan_U_> niru: Running as root / having a passwordless sudo is not recommended and insecure
[10:24] <n0yd> niru: Heh, yes its possible, unfortunately it appears ubuntu sets up sudo differently than say a default install of sudo, I'm trying to to figure it out myself at the moment
[10:24] <nzhomie> cmt^^ : install a program called automatix it is like synaptic but has comon software that people use it can install a good DC++ program for you
[10:25] <Jordan_U_> !automatix | nzomie
[10:25] <ubotu> nzomie: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[10:25] <Jordan_U_> cmt^^: Don't use automatix ^^^^^^^
[10:25] <Hawkins> Does anyone knows how to get Voodoo Banshee working on Ubuntu ?

[10:25] <n0yd> umar: hmm?
[10:26] <ryba> ryba
[10:26] <niru> n0yd:then ubuntus sudo package is different you mean?
[10:26] <umar> n0yd, i think some where we need to tweek password or shadow files
[10:26] <n0yd> niru: Apparently, different from using sudo on my Arch and Gentoo installs
[10:27] <n0yd> umar: Ya, I'm looking into that right now
[10:27] <umar> n0yd, sudo can be used from terminal
[10:27] <n0yd> umar: Of it can
[10:27] <umar> n0yd, but for GUI
[10:27] <umar> n0yd, accessing from menu
[10:27] <umar> n0yd, for example network settings,,,,,,
[10:27] <n0yd> I'm trying to set it up so it's passwordless, but /etc/sudoers isn't used by ubuntu's sudo pkg apparently
[10:28] <n0yd> So I can have my bash alias' working...
[10:28] <niru> umar:then does it mean that ubuntu's sudo pacakge will solve the problem?
[10:28] <umar> niru, no
[10:28] <umar> niru, i think
[10:30] <niru> n0yd:then does it mean that ubuntu's sudo pacakge will solve the problem of suppressing the root password
[10:31] <SilverTab> mmm ok in dmesg I get: wlan0: no IPv6 routers present...this might have something to do with it

[10:51] <Phelanor> He uses Ubuntu for ease of deployment
[10:51] <frogzoo> dogfood2006: cli browsers - try links2 or elinks

[10:51] <rj45> im new
[10:52] <dogfood2006> i hate having to use the cursor keys to go up and down on a website whe my fingers are already on the qwerty kb
[10:52] <dogfood2006> besides on the thinkpad the cursor keys are totally displaced
=== pitti_ is now known as pitti
[10:53] <dogfood2006> links2 or elinks, which one should i use
[10:53] <JQG> Phelanor>	thanks
[10:58] <dogfood2006> thanks for the suggestion on elinks and links2 but it doesnt look like you can use vi commands to navigate
[10:58] <vlt> Hawkins: I have no experience with gnome's or kde's integrated remote desktop server (I only rememer it beeing a bit too slow for my needs). I succressfully use a separate vncserver running and its own gnome/kde/whatever session.
[10:59] <elfreakz> i upgraded too 6.10, i feel that the bootup is slow.. is that normal?
[10:59] <dogfood2006> basically i'd like to be able to navigate with hjkl
[10:59] <dogfood2006> you can do this in gmail
[11:00] <Hawkins> vlt, using separate vncserver is it possible to have VNC connection in console too, for example when booting X ?
[11:00] <vlt> Hawkins: Install the pkg tightvncserver, run `vncserver :1` as user and define a password. Then connect to it with a vncviewer on Port ::5901 (or just :1), and run .....
[11:00] <vlt> Hawkins: mmh, don#t got your question ...
[11:01] <vlt> How can I set stdin as input file for pbzip2?
[11:01] <vlt> And where is lzma in Dapper?
[11:01] <Hawkins> When I use CRTL+ALT+backspace to reboot X my VNC disconnects, I have to go to Ubuntu PC and log in there, return to my Win PC here and then reconnect VNC
[11:02] <vlt> Hawkins: With separate vncserver you don't need to run an ordinary X server at all on the ubuntu machine.
[11:03] <Hawkins> Ah, I'll try to set up vncserver now :)
[11:03] <karthik> i have installed windows in hd0,1 and linux in hd0,0 every time i boot linux is booting and its not giving me an option in the boot time could anyone plz help out in this problem
[11:03] <vlt> Hawkins: You start (mayabe several) vnc*server* sessions for maybe different users on different ports ...
[11:04] <aL\away> does ubunto have any firewall
[11:04] <aL\away> if not do i need one
[11:04] <vlt> karthik: using GRUB or LILO as boot loader?
[11:04] <aL\away> and what options do i have
[11:05] <karthik> iam using grub but i dosent work
[11:05] <vlt> aL\away: Ubuntu is based on the linux kernel which has built in firewall "iptables"
[11:05] <nzhomie> ubuntu has a built in firewall you have to get firestarter from aptget or synaptic
[11:05] <elfreakz> is it normal for 6.10 bootup slow?
[11:05] <aL\away> vlt
[11:05] <Hawkins> vlt, I only need one, and I do need Xserver too, because that Ubuntu machine is going to be a normal operating PC with graphical interface. Currently I've got some network problems with that machine so I can't normally use it
[11:05] <vlt> aL\away: By default no rules are defined
[11:05] <karthik> title windowsxp(loader)
[11:05] <aL\away> how can i view configuration
[11:06] <vlt> aL\away: By default no rules are defined
[11:06] <aL\away> how can i define rules
[11:06] <nzhomie> download firestarter it is a nice gui that can help you make rules
[11:06] <vlt> aL\away: You can create rules with the `iptables` command
[11:06] <Hawkins> Is vncserver and vnc4server the same software ?
[11:07] <nzhomie> firestarter if you prefer gui
[11:07] <vlt> Hawkins: vncserver is a virtual pkg I think. But I reccommend using tightvncserver for there are some font problems with vnc4server on ubuntu (dapper at least)
[11:07] <karthik> dudes i entered the following commands in the grub-----> title windowsxp(loader) root (hd0,1) makeactive chainloader+1 <------its giving me an option but oc selecting it its giving me an error and asking me to restart
[11:07] <DocTomoe> Are there any known (even inofficial) OOo2.1 repositories for Edgy?
[11:08] <vlt> aL\away: There are several gui tools for creating rules as nzhomie said before.
[11:08] <Hawkins> vlt, thank you, downloading and installing now :)
[11:08] <vlt> How can I set stdin as input file for pbzip2?
[11:08] <vlt> And where is lzma in Dapper?
[11:09] <karthik> dudes i entered the following commands in the grub-----> title windowsxp(loader) root (hd0,1) makeactive chainloader+1 <------its giving me an option but oc selecting it its giving me an error and asking me to restart
[11:09] <aL\away> ok
[11:09] <aL\away> thanks
[11:09] <nzhomie> no problem
[11:10] <Quinn_Storm> anyone know how to change which volume channel the shortcut keys control? on my card the first listed channel is the headphone-only channel, and I need them to control the speaker channe;l
[11:10] <Starcraftmazter> whats X11
[11:10] <Tomcat_> vlt: I don't know pbzip2, but if it's compatible to bzip2, stdin is default.
[11:10] <karthik> dudes i entered the following commands in the grub-----> title windowsxp(loader) root (hd0,1) makeactive chainloader+1 <------its giving me an option but oc selecting it its giving me an error and asking me to restart
[11:11] <Tomcat_> vlt: apt-get install lzma?
[11:11] <Tomcat_> karthik: What error?
[11:11] <nzhomie> x11 is The X Window System (X11) is the basis of Ubuntu's user interface
[11:11] <Starcraftmazter> thanks
[11:12] <nzhomie> no problem
[11:12] <Quinn_Storm> I hate to ask such a basic question, but I have no idea what app even handles the keys
[11:12] <vlt> Tomcat_: `apt-cache search lzma`        -->     p7zip - 7-Zip is a file archiver with high compression ratio
[11:12] <karthik> Invalid Drive specification
[11:13] <Tomcat_> karthik: Do you have WinXP on hd0,1? Check with grub or gparted.
[11:13] <vlt> Tomcat_: Is it the same as "lzma" on Edgy/Debian/...?
[11:13] <_goofy_> i do i install a rpm
[11:13] <Jordan_U_> Quinn_Storm: I don't know why I can't figure it out again, I did it myself a while ago, it's in the menues when you click the volume icon in the gnome-panel
[11:14] <Hawkins> vlt, could you please help me with vncserver, can't connect now ?
[11:14] <Jordan_U_> !RPM | _goofy_
[11:14] <ubotu> _goofy_: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[11:14] <Hawkins> In private message perhaps
[11:14] <Tomcat_> vlt: I have no idea. Never used it. :o
[11:14] <Quinn_Storm> Jordan_U_: the menu for the volume control only changes what pops up when you click on it
[11:14] <_goofy_> correction how do i install a .rpm
[11:14] <Quinn_Storm> Jordan_U_: it doesn't change what the hotkeys are connected to
[11:14] <_goofy_> sorry i didnt see the earlyer post
[11:16] <vlt> Hawkins: Did you install "tightvncserver"?
[11:16] <Jordan_U_> Quinn_Storm: I recently set my volume keys to change the PCM channel instead of the "front" channel and I vaugly remember using those preferences but I can't figure it out again
[11:16] <vlt> Hawkins: Are you on Dapper or Edgy?
[11:17] <Hawkins> vlt, I installed it, set vncpasswd and typed vncserver:1 and in system monitor i see it running
[11:17] <Quinn_Storm> heh
[11:17] <Hawkins> vlt Dapper
[11:18] <vlt> Hawkins: `netstat -tulpen | grep vnc`
[11:18] <vlt> Hawkins: Which port is used
[11:18] <vlt> ?
[11:18] <phrizer> how can i remove "open with" menu items in nautilus? I recently removed some software but the open with items for it are persisting.
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[11:19] <Jordan_U_> Quinn_Storm: Right click on the volume icon and go to preferences
[11:20] <Quinn_Storm> ok...
[11:20] <Hawkins> vlt, there's 2 rows, ports are 5901 nad 6001
[11:20] <Quinn_Storm> (I've already been here)] 
[11:20] <Hawkins> *and
[11:21] <Jordan_U_> Quinn_Storm: Are you trying to make the same keys controll a different channel or are you trying to make a new key mapping?
[11:21] <elfreakz> anybody know how to i do change my desktop look, like dock, calendar, weather, theme?
[11:21] <Quinn_Storm> I need the volume keys (and the little mid-screen meter) to control the speaker channel instead of the headphones one
[11:21] <vlt> Hawkins: Connect from vncviewer to port 5901: `vncviewer host::5901` or `vncviewer host:1`
[11:22] <Hawkins> vlt, I got in, didn't know I have to use ip::port :)
[11:22] <Hawkins> With that integrated thingy it needed only ip
[11:22] <vlt> Hawkins: Now you should see an empty X screen (if not defined any "autostart" command in .vnc/x_somethin.conf)
[11:23] <vlt> Hawkins: [only ip]  That's because the default port is 5900
[11:23] <ravhin> good morning
[11:23] <Hawkins> vlt, yep, empty console type screen
[11:23] <ski-worklap> is it possible to make particular apps (i'm thinking specifically of gaim here) to not start if there is another process already running, a la how windows/mac do it? it's very annoying to accidentally open an extra gaim and not be sure which if any of the programs are still connected... any ideas?
[11:24] <ravhin> does someone in here by chance have a solution handy how to get apache to rotate logs?
[11:24] <georgian2all> any romania users?
[11:24] <ski-worklap> ravhin, how about rotatelogs?
[11:24] <ravhin> ?
[11:24] <ski-worklap> !ro
[11:24] <ubotu> Daca doriti ajutor sau doriti sa discutati despre Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu, intrati pe #ubuntu-ro.
[11:25] <ski-worklap> ravhin, rotatelogs is a simpe little log rotater that is bundled with apache (at least in 1.x)
[11:25] <Jordan_U_> Quinn_Storm: That is in the preferences for me when I right click the volume icon in gnome-panel I get this: http://trogdoor.googlepages.com/Screenshot.png
[11:25] <ski-worklap> or you can use syslog.conf or something like that to d oit
[11:25] <ski-worklap> TROGDOR!
[11:25] <ski-worklap> there's only one o in trogdor
[11:25] <ski-worklap> err, there are 2, not 3 o's in trogdor :)
[11:26] <teclo-> Hello. Do you think 512 MB RAM on a iBook would be enough to run Ubuntu 6.06 ?
[11:26] <mumbl> ski-worklap: afaik this is an application' task to check wether it is already running
[11:26] <ravhin> ski-worklap: ahhh thank you. I didn't find that through google
[11:26] <raskar> hi every body
[11:26] <Quinn_Storm> Jordan_U_: I do too but it does NOT change what the hotkeys ontrol
[11:26] <ski-worklap> mumbl, yeah, that's how firefox does it, i wonder why gaim doesn't
[11:26] <ski-worklap> teclo-, definitely
[11:27] <Dandre> hello
[11:27] <mumbl> ski-worklap: i'm a bit upset of this too. to my mind this is a bug in gaim
[11:27] <teclo-> ski-worklap: thank you
[11:27] <MeisterZopf> how do I configure the keyboard layout so I can push the windows button and the Applications menu opens?
[11:27] <elfreakz> my 6.10 start very slow.. is that normal?
[11:27] <cwillu> how can I change the default action when clicking on a mount that pops up on the desktop?
[11:27] <Dandre> I am looking for a graphical frontend to diff for gnome in ubuntu distro Is there such a tool?
[11:27] <teclo-> Now talking about cpu speed. Do you think a G3 running at 600 MHz will be enough ubuntu-powerpc with KDE as a GUI ?
[11:28] <tripppy> is vdr availbe for ubuntu?
[11:28] <anorexicpillow> wow question after question in here
[11:28] <ski-worklap> mumbl, i suppose i could write a shell script as a launcher that says ps auxww | grep -v grep | grep /usr/bin/gaim || /usr/bin/gaim
[11:28] <ski-worklap> but that sucks
[11:28] <ski-worklap> teclo-, yep
[11:28] <cwillu> anorexicpillow: and only you can fix the balence :)
[11:28] <ski-worklap> you can tune how many effects show in kde
[11:28] <anorexicpillow> lol
[11:28] <teclo-> ski-worklap: yeah, I know KDE well :)
[11:28] <ski-worklap> teclo-, then why ask?
[11:28] <mumbl> ski-worklap, i think gnome devs are working on a general solution for this already
[11:28] <ski-worklap> you know you can
[11:29] <mumbl> i'm not sure though
[11:29] <vlt> Hawkins: Now you can start your favorite WM or DE. I'm on kubuntu actually so I ran `startkde` now. Don't know the gnome cmd. Maybe you shoul type "start" and then <TAB> and look what it's offering you ...
[11:29] <teclo-> hmmm wait
[11:29] <teclo-> but 128MB of RAM won't be enough for KDE I guess
[11:29] <ski-worklap> teclo-, you could run xubuntu if you are worried about gui effects slowing your machine down
[11:29] <ski-worklap> teclo-, 128MB is enough but that's cutting it close
[11:30] <ski-worklap> i'd go with xfce in xubuntu in that case
[11:30] <anorexicpillow> okay i have a question:P Why doesny headset mic work? it doesnt work for music or talking :(
[11:30] <elfreakz> teclo-, KDE is for desktop midification?
[11:30] <ski-worklap> anorexicpillow, sudo alsamixer
[11:30] <ski-worklap> see if your headphone is set to volume 0
[11:30] <anorexicpillow> okay ill go do those now :)
[11:30] <vlt> I'm trying to uncompress an lzma compressed stream on dapper. I tried `somedata | 7z e -si -so` but it tells me "Incorrect command line". What's wrong here?
[11:30] <ski-worklap> gnome doesn't autodtect headphones being plugged in and switch fromthe main speakers in my experience
[11:31] <ski-worklap> ok i've answered enough questions. time to masturbate.
[11:31] <teclo-> ski-worklap: well I have boxes with 128MB of RAM here, but I run fluxbox on them because kde would be too slow. But my goal is here to buy a second-hand 12 inches iBook that will be fast enough to run KDE at a decent speed. I'm gonna put 512 MB of RAM in it, but I'm worried about the processor speed. I guess a G4 around 1 GHz shoudl be enough
[11:31] <ski-worklap> teclo-, cpu speed wise you should be fine
[11:32] <Hawkins> vlt, it's startx in gnome, but it says following: X: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting. and if I sudo it says Fatal server error: Server is already active for display 0
[11:32] <ski-worklap> esp. if you have accelerated graphics driver
[11:32] <cwillu> teclo-: memory's really the big thing to worry about;  512 should be fine (256 is my limit)
[11:32] <rapid> teclo-, a 1gig with 512 of ram is plenty
[11:32] <ski-worklap> only concern i'd have is memory on those 128M boxes - run xfce on them
[11:32] <anorexicpillow> okay in alsamixer headphones doesnt have a meter its just a little box that says 00
[11:32] <ski-worklap> anorexicpillow, arrow over to it and pres up a few times
[11:33] <eyalw> exit
[11:33] <anorexicpillow> it highlights everything :S
[11:33] <ski-worklap> anorexicpillow, that's weird
[11:33] <vlt> Hawkins: Yes, that's right. startx is not the cmd to run gnome DE, it runs an X server
[11:33] <teclo-> won't a 600 MHz G3 be too slow ?
[11:33] <ski-worklap> maybe alsa doesn't undersatnd the headphone line on your soundcard
[11:34] <ski-worklap> you can get one of those usb headsets
[11:34] <Hawkins> Ah
[11:34] <anorexicpillow> this isnt a usb one its a mic in and headphone jack :S
[11:34] <ski-worklap> teclo-, depends on what effects you have and if you have an accelerated graphics driver
[11:34] <rapid> teclo-, I had a 600 mhz laptop running kde pretty good and playing full screen videos
[11:34] <anorexicpillow> http://img344.imageshack.us/img344/1949/screenshotip8.png
[11:34] <ski-worklap> i feel like i'm repeating myself ....
[11:34] <Hawkins> It's the only thing typing start and pressing tab brings up
[11:34] <vlt> Can anyone tell Hawkins the eqiv command for "startkde" taht runs gnome?
[11:34] <teclo-> rapid: sounds nice
[11:34] <ski-worklap> anorexicpillow, yeah. i had that problem on a laptop once
[11:34] <vlt> s/taht/that/
[11:35] <anorexicpillow> did you ever get it fixed?
[11:35] <ski-worklap> no that comp was a loaner
[11:35] <teclo-> rapid: uhh I mean 600 MHz PowerPC processor. A PowerPC at 600 MHz is faster than a x86 processor at 600 MHz
[11:35] <ski-worklap> anorexicpillow, try master m and master s, alsa might have misidentified which is the headphone ine
[11:35] <ski-worklap> line
[11:35] <anorexicpillow> okay ill try that now
[11:36] <cwillu> how can i rerun the autorun action for a device without ejecting it?
[11:36] <rapid> teclo-: you can always make it faster by removing unneeded stuff etc
[11:36] <anorexicpillow> hmmm nothing seems to be happening
[11:37] <Starcraftmazter> how do I stop firefox from grouping windows, xp style?
[11:37] <McMadd> Does anybody know where the powermanagement settings are stored? I need to prevent my monitor from going blank. (I've got an alternate .xsession running)
[11:37] <cwillu> Starcraftmazter: just open stuff in new windows
[11:37] <Starcraftmazter> thats exactly what I do
[11:37] <slacker> lo
[11:37] <Starcraftmazter> and then once I have heaps, they bunch up

[11:42] <slacker> Rage__: that is doing the update
[11:42] <cyber_brain_mfkg> hello! last night i was removeing some programs and something happends with my gnome!panels are strange(some icons missing),icons in menu are missing,can't open themes,can't open synaptic(it says wrong password)
[11:42] <Starcraftmazter> I somehow got rid of all the progs on the panel??
[11:42] <Rage__> slacker: It shows you first.
[11:42] <slacker> and aptitude update && aptitude upgrade is safer
[11:42] <slacker> when the update fails it will not upgrade
[11:42] <cyber_brain_mfkg> i think i removed something gnome uses but don't know what
[11:42] <slacker> but thats besides the point
[11:42] <Hawkins> vlt, might be that I did something wrong while setting up server, I mean using 'netstat -tulpen | grep vnc' I see two lines even though I ran only 'vncserver :1' once
[11:43] <slacker> ok, an upgrade simulate will do it
[11:43] <slacker> but i'm sure there is another way
[11:44] <vlt> Hawkins: I think on 600x the java server is listening ...
[11:44] <cyber_brain_mfkg> someone has idea what to do?any sugestions are welcome else i will put FedoraCore 6 and i will give up of Ubuntu :(
[11:45] <cyber_brain_mfkg> but everything was working just fine till last night
[11:45] <slacker> what did you remove?
[11:45] <vlt> Hawkins: i just tried on Debian. The command there seems to be `gnome-session`. And I get the same error (don't know, if anyone else on that machine runs gnome right now, so I don't want to try the "--replace" option).

[11:50] <munk3h> elfreakz: run firefox from a terminal, then when it automatically quits, post the results along with the page you were on into an ubuntu forum post.
[11:50] <finalbeta> elfreakz, if you start it it will ask to resume the session.

[12:18] <Empiric> 6.06
[12:18] <maswan> systemtap is supposed to work in edgy with linux-image-debug installed, right?

[12:19] <morgs> Empiric: try the memtest option when you boot - could be faulty RAM. A big cause of random crashes is subtle hardware issues
[12:19] <eyalw> hi

[12:21] <morgs> Empiric: perhaps somebody else has an idea...
[12:21] <elfreakz> morgs, but it say i dont have permission?

[12:21] <eyalw> how do i configure php 5 to use mySQL? ??
[12:22] <elfreakz> morgs, usr/share/xmms/skins
[12:22] <morgs> elfreakz: you should keep all your content under your home directory - look for a ".xmms" folder in your home directory or something like that
[12:23] <morgs> elfreakz: ls -al in a terminal, or show hidden files in File Browser to see folders starting with "."
[12:23] <elfreakz> morgs, i try.. wait
[12:23] <_goofy_> how do i mount a usb drive so that is can be accessed by anyone not just the owner
[12:24] <Mando> hey wutsup.. whats the best dreamweaver substitute for linux?
[12:24] <elfreakz> morgs, there's only desktop in HOME
[12:24] <morgs> elfreakz: if you want to put it in /usr/share/xmms/skins you need to be root with sudo... but you shouldn't need to put that type of thing there since most apps have a local (hidden) config folder in your home directory
[12:24] <morgs> elfreakz: press Ctrl+H
[12:25] <elfreakz> morgs, then? after CTRL+H what should i see?
[12:25] <morgs> elfreakz: in the file browser you would then see a bunch of folders starting with "." appearing in your home directory
[12:26] <tonyyarusso> Mando: Nvu's worth a look
[12:26] <morgs> elfreakz: look for one with xmms in the name
[12:26] <elfreakz> morgs, yeah i see the "."
[12:26] <morgs> elfreakz: I don't use xmms so I'm guessing here, but most Ubuntu apps work like this
[12:26] <elfreakz> morgs, but no xmms folder :(
[12:27] <morgs> elfreakz: failing this, the answer to your original question is to open the terminal (in Applications/Accessories) and type "sudo mv ~/Desktop/[your file to move]  /usr/share/xmms/skins/"

[12:29] <mats> eyalw: i would recomed #MYSQL og #PHP
[12:29] <khaled> can anyone help plz
[12:29] <eyalw> mats: hmm.. there no such channels i checked
[12:29] <morgs> khaled: "grep universe /etc/apt/sources.list"
[12:30] <morgs> khaled: you should get only one line not starting with #
[12:30] <elfreakz> morgs, thats work :) thank you
[12:30] <morgs> elfreakz: :-)
[12:30] <khaled> morgs, what does this do?
[12:30] <mats> eyalw: what? there is - and i think does guys is better too help you. I dont know - but i would think so.
[12:30] <k-man_--> how do i find out which package contains a particular file?
[12:30] <khaled> morgs, can u explain more plz?
[12:30] <johns^> t
[12:30] <cjwatson> k-man_--: dpkg -S <filename>
[12:30] <morgs> khaled: grep searches for a pattern in a file. grep universe will show lines which have "universe" in them.
[12:31] <k-man_--> cjwatson, i mean for a package that is not installed yet
[12:31] <chable> hello
[12:31] <cjwatson> k-man_--: if you're looking for a file in a package you might not have installed, use http://packages.ubuntu.com/
[12:31] <k-man_--> i need to find the package that has the unistd.h header
[12:31] <eyalw> mats: ok, ill try again php and MYSQL
[12:31] <morgs> khaled: you should only have one line in /etc/apt/sources.list showing universe, unless the others start with # which means they are commented out
[12:31] <cjwatson> k-man_--: (there's also apt-file, but packages.ubuntu.com is probably easier for a one-shot search)
[12:31] <smoenux> !sound
[12:31] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

[12:31] <elfreakz> morgs, do you know how to search files in ubuntu?
[12:31] <khaled> morgs, grep... gave me 6 lines
[12:32] <k-man_--> thanks cjwatson
[12:32] <morgs> khaled: yes I see, do any of them start with deb and no #?

[12:35] <mcliber> hi

[12:35] <morgs> khaled: go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and paste in the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:35] <mcliber> hi boys
[12:35] <mats> elfreakz: xmms, mpg123 but you need some gstreamer-libs

[12:37] <kraut> moin
[12:37] <VSpike> isn't there an ntfs driver called ntfs3b or something like that?
[12:37] <k-man_--> how does ubuntu decide which run level to start in at boot time?
[12:37] <k-man_--> does it not use inittab?
[12:38] <morgs> khaled: I can't see anything wrong :(
[12:39] <cjwatson> k-man_--: up to dapper, it's the 'id' (initdefault) field in /etc/inittab; from edgy on, it's /etc/event.d/rc-default (which does look at /etc/inittab too, for compatibility)
[12:39] <morgs> khaled: unfortunately I have to go, hope somebody here can help!

[12:46] <ken> i am having a "nvidia geforce fx 5200"
[12:46] <johns^> ken: did you install nvidia-glx?
[12:46] <ken> no
[12:46] <smoenux> ken, ah... ic, just bot back to my pc :P
[12:46] <ken> i dont wish to
[12:46] <smoenux> got*
[12:46] <johns^> ken: apt-get install nvidia-glx
[12:46] <johns^> ah
[12:46] <ken> is it possible for me to get correct refresh rate without using any proprietry drivers?
[12:46] <johns^> in dpkg-reconfigure, did you enter the memory size?
[12:47] <johns^> like 128000
[12:47] <smoenux> ken have you triied to add the extra resolutions you need to the xorg.conf file ?
[12:47] <ken> johns^: no i left it blank
[12:47] <rapid> see-g, do another 10000 then come back
[12:47] <johns^> ken: then try again
[12:47] <ken> smoenux: I added it through reconfigure command
[12:47] <johns^> ken: at the end, select 'medium' instead of advanced
[12:48] <ken> johns^: selecting medium doesn't help
[12:48] <johns^> ken: so you can select resolutions and refresh rates
[12:48] <johns^> ken: and adding the memory size?
[12:48] <see-g> rapid: with or without bugfixing? (what was it like? approximately one bug in 100 lines of code?)
[12:48] <ken> johns^: And manually entering my VxH refresh rates in "advanced" too doesn't help
[12:48] <smoenux> Can someone help me with my Sound! I have 5.1 surround (which works fine btw) but the Base is comming out the wrong speaker !!!
[12:48] <johns^> ken: agiain: and adding the memory size?
[12:49] <smoenux> my speaker is dying
[12:49] <gavin> Soo, yeah. Anybody know why I can't install real player? What's xlib?
[12:49] <ken> johns^: from what i understand people with memory onboard the graphics card (mine has 128mb dedicated GPU memory) are supposed to keep it blank. SO i kept it blank
[12:49] <prOMiNd> oO Hello aLL Oo :.
[12:49] <johns^> ken: maybe, but i've got an fx 5200 with no problems up to 1600x1400 or something
[12:50] <johns^> then again, I'm using nvidia-glx
[12:50] <ken> johns^: but my monitorCRT can't support those resolutions
[12:51] <ken> johns^: i simply want 800x600 @ 85Hz. which my monitor supports in Windows. I selected it in reconfiugre..."medium", as well as put the values in "advanced". but that doesn't help
[12:51] <johns^> well, that's strange
[12:52] <ken> johns^: Now, whenever i select 800x600 or 640x480, the screen resolution dialog box says (86Hz), whereas it actually should be 85Hz (my monitor can only support 85hz not more than that, how do i bring the value back to 85hz)
[12:52] <ken> so than when i select either 800x600 or 640x480, x simply restarts
[12:53] <ken> and i am stuck in 1024x768 @ 61Hz (this too should be 60Hz), but somehow this all got messed up. I reconfigured the x file various times, using the refresh rates of my manual. but that doesn;t help
[12:53] <cpk1> ken: do you know the HorizSync and VertRefresh for your monitor?
[12:53] <ken> PLEASE HELP
[12:53] <ken> cpkl: my manual says it
[12:53] <ken> cpkl: and i did a internet search and found that online information agrees with my manual
[12:53] <cpk1> ken: and you put those values into xorg.conf?

[12:58] <eltech> why cant ubuntu just take a free partition i have and just install without creating the paritions manually?
[12:58] <anorexicpillow> okay that is weird.. when i click on my clock to open the calender it says that "The Application Clock Applet has quit unexpectedly"
[12:58] <tonyyarusso> eltech: It can...you just have to tell it to use that one
[12:58] <ken> These values are right, i know that, i entered it into the "advanced" section from my manual
[12:59] <gnomefreak> !pastebin > ken
[12:59] <dreamer> anybody here with mt-daap experience ?
[12:59] <eltech> hmm .. i did .. not happening though
[12:59] <eltech> only manual, use continuous free space or erase whole hard disk
[12:59] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Start the computer with a live-cd. Run a root-terminal, type: grub (enter) , wait, in prompt type root(hd0,0) if your /boot or / partition is hda1 (enter) setup(hd0) (enter) then just quit
[01:00] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: the bot said it better
[01:00] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: i'm logged into my system with the destroyed grub atm using the SGD super grub disc
[01:00] <Mandy|P> right now
[01:00] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: ok
[01:00] <tonyyarusso> eltech: manually edit the table, yes, but you don't have to create anything
[01:00] <mOZ> i've never worked with linux before so i have no idea. If I install ubuntu on a USB stick, will I be able to install software and use them, or will it be as if i was inserting a live cd?
[01:00] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: What is your root-partition?
[01:00] <eltech> lets try it again then i guess
[01:01] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: how can i figure this out?
[01:01] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: type: cat /etc/fstab
[01:01] <gavin> mOZ: You can install software if you are using a USB stick (of course assuming you have room).
[01:01] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: find line with /
[01:01] <gavin> mOZ: It's basically no different than a hard-disk.
[01:01] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: it says something like /dev/hda1
[01:02] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: or if you have one eith /boot, then that one
[01:02] <mOZ> great thnx. it's exactly what i need. I need to develop a project for the university under linux, so having it on usb stick will be no problem moving my job from uni and back
[01:03] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: you mean / under mount point?
[01:03] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: yup
[01:03] <Mandy|P> there is no line with that
[01:03] <Mandy|P> only with /proc
[01:03] <Mandy|P> maybe that's the reason why my first tries to restore it failed
[01:03] <ken> gnomefreak: smoenux: kaptengu: cpkl: paste bin is giving my QUERY FAILURE, DUPLICATE entry, and all rubbish, please help me
[01:03] <ken> *me
[01:03] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: :(
[01:04] <mOZ> I tried installing on an external hard-disk for that reason but wouldnt boot properly. gave kernel panic error.  USB should be fine i guess

[01:13] <Mandy|P> yes
[01:14] <khaled> ken, yesterday i have just decided after one year of hesitation to completely delete windows and never use pirated software again, u r not helping me! :)

[01:21] <ken> HELP, what are the "nv" drivers that appear in the list of drivers when one runs sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:22] <ken> Does "nv"=nvidia?
[01:22] <ken> So if i am having a nvidia card, should i select, VESA or NV from that list?
[01:22] <cyphase> ken: yes
[01:22] <Blippe> is it possible to get usplash to work on a 1024x640 screen?
[01:22] <cyphase> nv
[01:22] <ken> cyphase: and am i using free or proprietry drivers when i say "nv"?
[01:22] <cyphase> ken: nv is the open source driver. nvidia is closed source, but it has 3D support
[01:23] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: The only thing I can think of is that we got the root-partition wrong somehow. Try other combinations. root (hd0,2)
[01:23] <ken> cyphase: So i am having nvidia geForce fx5200, and i should select "nv" from that list, which is open source nvidia driver (NOT proprietry one), and 3D support will be DISABLED, right?
[01:24] <cyphase> ken: right
[01:24] <cyphase> ken: it's not "disabled", it just doesn't work
[01:24] <kogler> Hi, I'm on Ubuntu 6.06.1, and I wish to move to Xubuntu 6.10.
[01:24] <ken> cyphase: And if i want 3d support there is no way except to install nvidia-glx, right?
[01:25] <kogler> How do I do this?
[01:25] <ken> kogler: And what's stopping you?
[01:25] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: there you go.. i did grub> root (hd0,1) and then setup (hd0) then it suceeded nice thanks your my hero :-*
[01:25] <ken> :)
[01:25] <cyphase> ken: right
[01:25] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Actually sorry...
[01:25] <Starcraftmazter> as a sidequestion, why do most websites look like crap? They look like IE7 is running them from windows, as opposed to ff2 from windows
=== kogler is now known as redblades
[01:25] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: That won't solve your problem...
[01:25] <Mandy|P> no?
=== redblades is now known as ledemente
[01:25] <kabtoffe> I just reread your questions...
[01:25] <phiqtion> can i get the msttcorefonts package from somewhere?
[01:25] <ken> cyphase: one more thing, what would happen if i select some other driver from that list in sudo dpkg-reconfigure...? for eg.VESA?
[01:26] <ledemente> ken, how do I do this?
[01:26] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Because the partitions are ordered differently now...
[01:26] <cpk1> ledemente: I was going to tell you what to do but now I have chalked you up to being a troll after switching names like that
[01:26] <ken> ledemente: what?
=== mrvertigo is now known as UbntuVERT

[01:26] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: I'm guessing it's the same as before
[01:26] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: So. No worries.
[01:26] <cyphase> ken: some won't work at all. vesa will work, but it'll be lagging and not as clear as nv
[01:26] <ledemente> cpkl, this isn't my computer - I had to change from the default and I accidentally changed to my old one.
[01:27] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: i will never try this again windows on linux
[01:27] <kabtoffe> But we need to alter your /boot/grub/menu.lst
[01:27] <Mandy|P> ok
[01:27] <kabtoffe> Anyone know if there's an easy way to alter grub's menu.lst???
[01:27] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: let's do it
[01:28] <ken> cyphase: Thank you, may i hug you:)?
[01:28] <cyphase> ken: that doesn't really work out over TCP/IP
[01:28] <ledemente> ken, what do I need to do to upgrade the distro, then the variant (XFCE)
[01:28] <cyphase> but thanx for the thought :P
[01:28] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Do you know how to edit a file with root?
[01:29] <Mandy|P> yes
[01:29] <ken> cyphase: Endnote, are you 100% sure nv=nvidia and its open source? I am thinking why didn't they put that in the list as "nvidia"?
[01:29] <cpk1> !upgrade
[01:29] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:29] <ken> cyphase: Hilarious comment :)
[01:29] <Mandy|P> paste it?
[01:29] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: You need to find the line that says default grub device
[01:29] <kabtoffe> kabtoffe: grub root device
[01:29] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: grub root device
[01:29] <kanzie> does anyone but me experience long loadingtimes when starting Firefox on Edgy?
[01:30] <ken> ledemente: I would suggest get a xubuntu 6.10 CD, and make a new system? That's least painfull. But still linux=painful, always remember! :)
[01:30] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: I seem to talk to myself, every now and then...
[01:30] <gnomefreak> ken: nv is not 3d
[01:30] <cyphase> ken: yes, nv is the nvidia driver. it's not called nvidia because that's the name of the closed source driver
[01:30] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: hehe :-) default grub 3 lines commented out
[01:30] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: They're supposed to be
[01:30] <ledemente> ken, I do have a CD, but I'd really rather not. I haven't used Linux for a while, and I'm rusty.
[01:30] <Mandy|P> kabtoffe: good
[01:30] <Mandy|P> now?
[01:31] <ken> gnomefreak: cyphase: Thank you, and that means if i want to do some 3d rendering in BLENDER, i wont be able to do unless i use nvidia-glx, right?
[01:31] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: what does groot= say?
[01:31] <gnomefreak> ken: correct
[01:31] <cyphase> ken: right
[01:31] <ken> ledemente: If you haven't used Linux for a while, than you are the perfect candidate for doing a fresh install
[01:31] <Mandy|P> ## e.g. groot=(hd0,0)
[01:31] <Mandy|P> # groot=(hd0,3)
[01:31] <ken> ledemente: As it is a fresh install is driving me nuts, i recommend not upgrading
[01:31] <kanzie> How can I get suspend to work on my Thinkpad T60 with xgl?
[01:32] <ken> gnomefreak: cyphase: Thank you for your help
[01:32] <cyphase> ken: your welcome
[01:32] <prOMiNd> any know how to install in opera adobe flash player ?!
[01:32] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: OK change that to (hd0,1)
[01:32] <ken> gnomefreak: I regret the first encounter was unpleasant, but we made up :)
[01:32] <gnomefreak> yw
[01:32] <gnomefreak> ken: its all good
[01:32] <Mandy|P> # groot=(hd0,1) ?
[01:32] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Wasn't it (hd0,1) that work in the grub install?
[01:32] <Mandy|P> with comment?
[01:32] <ken> bye, bye!
[01:32] <slicky> o
[01:32] <Mandy|P> yes
[01:32] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: yes with comment
[01:33] <ledemente> ken, I have no trouble installing. I simply do not want to. It is much less trouble to upgrade, because this isn't my computer and the person who owns it is somewhat particular.
[01:33] <Mandy|P> ok now
[01:33] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Save the file and run: update-grub
[01:33] <nzhomie> ok who needs help with something
[01:33] <Mandy|P> done
[01:34] <barros> have anyone here experienced some kind of conflict between a USB wireless adapter, using ndiswrapper, and pen-drive??
[01:34] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Now reopen the file and check if changed the root-line in all the boot options for ubuntu at the bottom of the file...
[01:34] <echosystm> is win4lin still faster than vmware?
[01:35] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: It should say root (hd0,1) under the title lines
[01:35] <Mandy|P> ## ## End Default Options ##
[01:35] <Mandy|P> title		Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-generic
[01:35] <Mandy|P> root		(hd0,1)
[01:35] <kanzie> how can I find out which kernel Im running?
[01:35] <Samuli^> kanzie, uname -r
[01:35] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: Now I think it should work.
[01:35] <Mandy|P> nice
[01:36] <Mandy|P> i will try it when it works i want a child from ymou
[01:36] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: If it wasn't for the new UUID stuff, your system wouldn't have booted at all.
[01:36] <kabtoffe> Mandy|P: With the grubdisc
[01:36] <kanzie> ok, so I have 2.6.17-10, if I want to update it... can I use synaptic?
[01:37] <teclo-> Say, how fast would Ubuntu 6.06 with KDE as a desktop on a iBook G3 at 900 MHz with 384 MB of RAM ?
[01:37] <teclo-> +be
[01:38] <Samuli^> kanzie, update-manager should take care of that.
[01:38] <rambo3> 30 km/h fast
[01:38] <Tidus> teclo-, shouldn't be too bad
[01:38] <Tigge> Can I somewhere find out what the new 2.6.17-10 kernel added over the old?
[01:38] <Tidus> teclo-, i had it running on a pentium 3 500mhz with 256mb ram... was still quite responsive
[01:39] <rambo3> Tigge, look in /boot and see what kernel config says
[01:39] <teclo-> Tidus: ah
[01:39] <teclo-> Tidus: but powerpc is faster than pentium at the same clock speed (RISC versus CISC processors)
[01:39] <Tidus> teclo-, i know that lol...
[01:39] <kabtoffe> Oops I just realized I missed a spot in the menu.lst... Mandy|P wont be able to boot :(
[01:39] <Tigge> rambo3: I'm not sure I can make anything out of that.. I'm not that technical :)
[01:39] <Tidus> i was sayin your desktop should still be quite responsive to it
[01:40] <cyphase> hmm, you can change the notification daemon theme in gconf

[02:01] <frogzoo> mr_claus: I'm pretty sure it runs - which version u have?
[02:01] <jrib> Bil_Bomba: hmm, I have no clue.  Sometimes people pass acpi=off and get ubuntu to boot when it refuses to.  You can give that a try, but if no one here knows at the moment you might want to try the forums or the mailing list
[02:01] <flavioribeiro> i just can wait and see the error

[02:52] <brnn> Hello
[02:52] <aL\away> but its 1.6.17
[02:52] <rusher> sudo apt-get install eggdrop is what i did
[02:53] <brnn> may I ask one question
[02:53] <aL\away> i want the upgraded version
[02:53] <aL\away> i tried to compile it
[02:53] <brnn> I have a computer with SATA hard drive
[02:53] <aL\away> but it gave me an error
[02:53] <beligum> Hi guys, does anyone know the name of the package with all the random quotes in it?
[02:54] <brnn> and when I try to install Kubuntu it can't identify it
[02:54] <brnn> what must I do?
[02:54] <frogzoo> beligum: install ones of the fortunes packages
[02:54] <beligum> ah, yes that's it, thanks
[02:55] <boyet> #iosn
[02:55] <brnn> I have a computer with SATA hard drive and when I try to install Kubuntu it can't identify the hard disc. What must I do to install Kubuntu??
[02:55] <rusher> it should pick it up
[02:56] <rusher> use the alternative install cd
[02:56] <rusher> that is what I had to do with my server
[02:56] <brnn> what exactly this alternative cd is different with?
[02:56] <Samuli^> alternative aka text-mode

[02:57] <rusher> how do you use eggdrop
[02:57] <brnn> I don't think I can make the installation in console mode
[02:57] <rusher> it will not let me do eggdrop -m
[02:57] <Samuli^> brnn, it's not in console and it's very easy
[02:57] <brnn> that's great
[02:57] <brnn> but
[02:57] <Samuli^> though desktop-install is easier
[02:58] <brnn> how the alternative cd is different from the normal?
[02:58] <Samuli^> I just told you
[02:59] <rusher> alternative cd is used for sata,raid
[02:59] <rusher> i found out the hard way
[02:59] <rusher> after many regular install fails
[02:59] <brnn> thank you very much then
[02:59] <brnn> I
[02:59] <brnn> will try it

[03:06] <pdlnhrd> where in edgy is there a tool to manage disks and mount points?   i seem to remember it in the prior release but can't seem to find it
[03:06] <aL\away> hay using ap-get to install eggdrop
[03:06] <rusher> it is not in edgy
[03:07] <rusher> 6.06 was the last version that supported it because it was umaintened
[03:07] <aL\away> how do i run eggdrop
[03:07] <pdlnhrd> rusher:  what would be a goood tool to do that?

[03:08] <pdlnhrd> rusher:  yes i know i can do it, the tool was just a little nicer
[03:08] <aL\away> someone help me plz
[03:08] <rusher> i miss it pdlnhrd
[03:08] <pdlnhrd> rusher:  plus i knew i had seen it before and was just trying to find it
[03:09] <rusher> dam beryl crashed
[03:09] <pdlnhrd> doesn't anyone know of a tool that is close to functionality?
[03:10] <rusher> can anyone walk me through eggdrop?
[03:11] <apokryphos> rusher: perhaps in #egghelp
[03:11] <dreamer> damnit, like, half of the time youtube-vids just hang after 3 seconds, I'm running dapper with flash9
[03:11] <MasterLexx> what was the name of the tool?
[03:11] <MasterLexx> not the ircbot tool.
[03:14] <pdlnhrd> does anyone know if there are stable tools for create/write/read ntfs partitions yet?
[03:15] <whyme> pdlnhrd: AFAIK ntfs write support is still beta...
[03:15] <whyme> :(
[03:15] <MasterLexx> paragon partition manager has some..... they are based on linux
[03:15] <rusher> gparted !
[03:15] <whyme> just install windiz on FAT32 and it won't be a problem though.
[03:15] <MasterLexx> has much less options
[03:15] <rusher> gparted has ntfs support

[03:15] <jbfavre> hello everybody, I have a software Raid problem with 3 firewire disks: on boot, the Array always set up in degraded mode. The system founds 1 disk only from 3. Any help please ?
[03:15] <pdlnhrd> whyme:  fat32 doesn't support 300 gigs and a few thousand files very well
[03:15] <jrib> dreamer: yeah, flash9 is buggy.  That happens to me too
[03:15] <whyme> not ntfs write... assuming that's what pdlnhrd wanted?
[03:16] <partisan> anybody use Mint? is it a pretty solid Ubuntu distro?
[03:16] <Slart> jbfavre: perhaps the disks aren't ready when you start the array?
[03:16] <jrib> partisan: try #ubuntu-offtopic
[03:16] <whyme> pdlnhrd: lol, no it doesn't... but it can support 200gb partitions... I guess it's a round about way, until NTFS write is stable....
=== ProN00b is now known as ProN00bX
[03:16] <whyme> partisan: mint?
[03:16] <jbfavre> Slart: it effectively seems to be that but how can I change this ?
[03:16] <whyme> !mint
[03:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mint - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:16] <MasterLexx> why don't you make a single partiton for your windows, and a big one for your windows files, you can use ext2 for it then
[03:16] <dreamer> jrib: that sucks !
[03:17] <clop> hi, i'm trying to get mplayer with xvmc running on edgy; i got the nvidia drivers and added libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so.1 to /etc/X11/XvMCConfig, but when I run mplayer -vo xvmc -vc ffmpeg12mc, i get the error: forced video codec: ffmpeg12mc, cannot find codec matching...
[03:17] <Slart> jbfavre: hmm..  I vaguely remember something about changing order of modules loaded etc when I read about software raid.. I don't know it by heart though.. sorry
[03:17] <partisan> Thanks--I saw Mint on DistroWatch and got curious. I'll check the link you suggest
[03:17] <pdlnhrd> whyme:  i guess i will have to use ext2 and install the ext2 extention on the windows box... thankx for everyones help
[03:18] <whyme> pdlnhrd: that's a point, ext2/3 write support in windows is fine using the fs2 driver, just install windiz onto fat32 if you need to write any system files(or ntfs if you don't) and the rest of the disk in ext3
[03:18] <Slart> jbfavre: but I'm sure there are wiser people than me that knows the answer to that =)
[03:18] <whyme> pdlnhrd:
[03:18] <whyme> pdlnhrd: precisely...
[03:18] <jbfavre> Slart: hope so. thanks for your help
[03:18] <whyme> how do I get a service to start on boot, when the service is called fcsctl and the user that must start is is called fcadmin?

[03:20] <whyme> frogzoo: thanks
[03:20] <cpk1> if I am installing edgy over my dapper install the only partition I need to format is / correct? i can leave /usr alone?
[03:21] <Ulixes> can someone explain me what are the differences between the alternate and normal version of edgy???
[03:21] <apokryphos> cpk1: erm, no, of course not.
[03:21] <Ulixes> pls
[03:21] <apokryphos> the only thing you should keep is /home
[03:21] <apokryphos> perhaps update your /etc
[03:21] <apokryphos> *backup
[03:21] <Slart> Ulixes: I think the alternate has a text only install menu-thingy
[03:21] <det> Is there an alternative for PLF?
[03:21] <apokryphos> Ulixes: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[03:21] <det> I hear the repository has been closed down.
[03:22] <NoStress> Ulixes: defaut installed desktop ? (kde, gnome, xfce...) ?
[03:22] <apokryphos> !plf
[03:22] <ubotu> PLF is the Penguin Liberation Front. For more info see: http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf. PLF is down indefinitely pending a new maintainer; see http://plf.zarb.org/. see also !seveas
[03:22] <cpk1> apokryphos: just backup /etc and then throw it back in after the install?
[03:22] <Ulixes> gnome
[03:23] <aL\away> !eggdrop
[03:23] <ubotu> eggdrop: Advanced IRC Robot. In component universe, is extra. Version 1.6.17-3 (edgy), package size 459 kB, installed size 1144 kB
[03:23] <frogzoo> !alternate | Ulixes
[03:23] <ubotu> Ulixes: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[03:24] <Ulixes> got it
[03:24] <Ulixes> but with the alternate i can only upgrade or install from 0 too?
[03:26] <xfugazix> Where should I install mplayer codecs for mplayer find them?
[03:26] <xfugazix> I installed essential-20061022.tar.bz2 in /usr/lib/codecs
[03:26] <xfugazix> But no way.
[03:26] <dreamer> so, on my 6.10 install, I get this ACPI: Invalid PBLK length [5]  during boot
[03:27] <apokryphos> cpk1: no, don't just throw it back in. Just pull in the configs that you need
[03:27] <apokryphos> cpk1: and always backup anything you overwrite
[03:27] <jrib> xfugazix: how did you install it?
[03:28] <xfugazix> jrib, cp
[03:28] <jrib> xfugazix: you have to extract the contents in there
[03:28] <xfugazix> I did.
[03:29] <jrib> xfugazix: what does 'ls /usr/lib/codecs'  say now?

[03:30] <Slart> bah.. third.. =)
[03:30] <flavioribeiro> ok
[03:30] <brohken> does anyone know which is better for a noob not used to a command line? ubuntu or FC6?
[03:30] <aL\away> !cli
[03:30] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[03:30] <Slart> jrib: is there a difference to using invoke-rc.d and the /etc/init.d thingy?
[03:30] <jrib> brohken: both are probably the same in that regard. Try both and see which one you like better
[03:31] <apokryphos> brohken: for a complete new user I'd perhaps say that Fedora has some nicer things. opensuse still trumps both IMO for new users.
[03:31] <jrib> Slart: no, not that I know of
[03:31] <apokryphos> brohken: ubuntu has nicer repositories than fedora though
[03:31] <Slart> jrib: ok, thanks
[03:31] <brohken> what are repositories?
[03:31] <apokryphos> !repositories
[03:31] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[03:32] <brohken> ah so default programs it comes with?
[03:32] <apokryphos> brohken: still, these days all distributions have very decent package repositories.
[03:32] <cmacis> hi people
[03:32] <brohken> how about installers.. which one is easiest?
[03:32] <xfugazix> jrib, What do you think? say many codecs
[03:32] <apokryphos> brohken: not just comes with, programs that are packaged and available in online locations
[03:32] <xfugazix> :P
[03:32] <apokryphos> brohken: they all have very easy installers
[03:32] <apokryphos> i.e. easier than windows
[03:32] <frogzoo> brohken: apt is pretty much best of breed
[03:32] <cmacis> still having troubles with my wireless, i'm currently connected to the router through wires
[03:32] <brohken> i know on linux requires you to compile a program
[03:32] <jrib> xfugazix: ok, what are you trying to do now that isn't working?
[03:32] <brohken> which I have very little knowledge of
[03:32] <apokryphos> brohken: no, you should never really need to compile.
[03:32] <jrib> brohken: no, it doesn't
[03:33] <brohken> ah
[03:33] <brohken> thanks guys
[03:33] <frogzoo> brohken: no compiling necessary
[03:33] <xfugazix> jrib, Play a video.
[03:33] <apokryphos> brohken: that's what repositories are for.
[03:33] <xfugazix> Only audio works.
[03:33] <jrib> xfugazix: with...?
[03:33] <xfugazix> mplayer
[03:33] <jrib> xfugazix: oh i may know why... where did you install mplayer from?
[03:33] <frogzoo> brohken: no to say that being able to compile doesn't have advantages o.O
[03:34] <brohken> ok well then since I'm ready to try ubuntu maybe you can help me with 2 other questions. 1. can you recommend me a dell laptop (i was thinknig the small 14.1" screen Dell) that should work out of the box. Also did anyone see that really step-by-step, simple install guide for Beryl? Not the one in Beryl's wiki. It was on a blog, which I can't find.

[03:38] <jrib> no
[03:38] <aL\away> or without
[03:38] <matt____> where should i mount a 200gb hard drive im going to use only for data?
[03:39] <jrib> matt____: anywhere you want, /media/foobar seems to be the usual place
[03:39] <tarzeau> other places are /export/data1 or /scratch or just /data
[03:39] <aL\away> so does that mean i go to /user/lib and edit config file
[03:39] <tarzeau> or in /mnt some dir
[03:39] <MarcN> matt____: where ever you want.  I like to use /Music or /Photos to give a clue what it is for.
[03:39] <aL\away> also to use eggdrop -m
[03:39] <cmacis> On my router setup it has ssid, not essid. will that make a difference?
[03:39] <aL\away> do i just type it in terminal

[03:47] <ubuntu> ubotu sudo
[03:47] <jrib> !msg the bot | ubuntu
[03:47] <ubotu> ubuntu: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[03:47] <ubuntu> ok man
[03:47] <ubuntu> su and sudo are one
[03:47] <jrib> ubuntu: no
[03:47] <ubuntu> why no
[03:47] <matt____> what is the lost/found folder good for?
[03:47] <jrib> ubuntu: read the link ubotu gave you please
[03:47] <matt____> is it necesary?
[03:47] <frogzoo> ubuntu: the man pages explain the differences in gory detail
[03:47] <ubuntu> ok thanks man.
[03:47] <enyc> matt____: its part of ext2/ext3 at least
[03:48] <ubuntu> ok Thanks all
[03:48] <enyc> matt____: e2fsck will complain if it is not there
[03:48] <matt____> can i make it "hidden"
[03:49] <enyc> matt____: not that i know of ;-) -- you could rename it to .lost+found but then it wouldn't be lost_found
[03:49] <minerale> jrib: here's the thing, if someone adds `vim` as a locally compiled file, add it to their path, and they type vim - it still shows vim, albeit not where it's running
[03:49] <frogzoo> matt____: lost+found is there for when fsck goes horribly wrong
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[03:49] <enyc> matt____: just dan't look in the root of the filesystem if you dont want to see it ;-)
[03:49] <matt____> there is an idea
[03:49] <matt____> so, i can create a folder
[03:49] <matt____> and then bookmark that folder
[03:49] <matt____> right?
[03:50] <frogzoo> matt____: leave it alone
[03:50] <HellWork> hi all
[03:50] <ubuntu> hi
[03:50] <matt____> what, the lost found folder?
[03:50] <ubuntu> much folders
[03:50] <matt____> im going to, i created a folder, and then bookmarked it
[03:50] <enyc> matt____: when the filesystem-checker is checking the filesystem (at least on ext2/ext3), it will link "lost inodes" (files/directories) into the /lost+found on that filesystem
[03:50] <matt____> that way, i can't see the lost found folder
[03:51] <LDZ420> is there a way to install my sql with apt-get?
[03:51] <jrib> !mysql | LDZ420
[03:51] <ubotu> LDZ420: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[03:51] <enyc> matt____: does that make sense?
[03:51] <matt____> not really, but if i leave the folder alone, it will be ok, won't it?
[03:51] <wolfeySI> which package is  usr/lib/postfix/dict_sdbm.so
[03:52] <enyc> matt____: well yes
=== Doodluv_ is now known as Doodluv
[03:52] <matt____> is it safe to mount the drive in /home
[03:52] <brohken> anyone here of a wireless problem with a dell notebooks? my friend tried to install ubuntu on his dell and wireless did not work out of the box
[03:52] <jrib> minerale: I see your point.  I don't know how to do that, but I'm curious too
[03:52] <matt____> so i can see it when i click home folder?
[03:52] <symbulos> hi there
[03:52] <symbulos> just installed ubuntu 6.10 on laptop but the screen is completely blank when I startup
[03:52] <brohken> he has a inspiron 1500 series i believe
[03:53] <symbulos> do you know how to start in console mode?
[03:53] <enyc> matt____: when the filesystem is being checked for errors (e2fsck, similar to chkdsk/scandisk basically)... "lost" files basically will be linked into /lost+found so you can access them
[03:53] <matt____> i get that
[03:53] <enyc> matt____: your homedir is probably soething like /home/matt
[03:53] <enyc> matt____: not /home
[03:53] <matt____> is it safe to do?
[03:53] <matt____> once i mounted it somewhere, i think /root
[03:53] <matt____> and my system froze
[03:53] <enyc> matt____: well if your homedir is aready on another partition then it doesn't directly make sense
[03:54] <frogzoo> no matt____ not /home   maybe /home/data if you like
[03:54] <enyc> matt____:  it depends exactyl whtat you are trying to do as nto what is sensible
[03:54] <matt____> ok
[03:54] <matt____> i think /data will work
[03:54] <frogzoo> matt____: if you mount directories over the top of system directories, bad things will happen
[03:54] <matt____> can i do this somehow?
[03:55] <Austerity> I made a mess of this install what is my best bet just reinstall or is there a way to wipe a bunch of things clean??
[03:55] <enyc> matt____: what type of filesystem are you trying to mount?
[03:55] <matt____> when i click PLACES/HOME FOLDER
[03:55] <matt____> i want to be able to have a folder called data
[03:55] <frogzoo> Austerity: option #1
[03:55] <enyc> matt____: ohhh
[03:55] <flavioribeiro> i wanna install libc development package, how can i?
[03:55] <matt____> and mount the drive there
[03:55] <LDZ420> What about if I am not interested in installing all of these application for server related issues I just want to work with My SQL.  (I will still hang on to this for future interest..)
[03:55] <enyc> matt you would wwath something like  /home/matt/data/ then ;-)
[03:55] <jrib> flavioribeiro: install build-essential, it will give you that
[03:55] <matt____> yes
[03:55] <Austerity> k thank you
[03:56] <enyc> matt____: that would be a mountpoint you could use -- /home/matt/data/ -- your HOME FALDER is /home/matt or similar (depends on username)
[03:56] <matt____> yes
[03:56] <matt____> so, what would the sudo be to give myself write permissions for that?
[03:56] <flavioribeiro> tnks jrib
[03:56] <enyc> matt____: erm what sort of filesystem?
[03:57] <matt____> ext3
[03:57] <enyc> matt____: right well is that case... it depends on the permissions in that filesystem ;-)
[03:57] <matt____> wait
[03:57] <matt____> never mind
[03:57] <matt____> i already have them
[03:57] <matt____> somehow...
[03:57] <enyc> matt____: you would be able to make the root of that filesystem owned but matt:matt so that you can write to that dir
[03:58] <matt____> back to the lost+found folder, can i make it where i just can't see it?
[03:58] <LDZ420> Thx Ubuntu Support Channel
[03:58] <LDZ420> :)
[03:58] <enyc> matt____: no don't bother ;-)
[03:58] <enyc> matt____: just ignore it
[03:58] <matt____> lol, ok
[03:58] <Kanafani> where are the default wallpapers on ubuntu?
[03:58] <matt____> neat freak
[03:59] <enyc> matt____: ive already told you that is a normal funciton of an ext3
[03:59] <brohken> does ubuntu update itself, sort of like windows updates?
[03:59] <enyc> brohken: not unless told to
[03:59] <Slart> brohken: yes.. but better =)
[03:59] <Slart> oops
[03:59] <brohken> err, which? heh
[03:59] <Slart> mine does
[03:59] <jrib> !hidden | matt____: maybe this will do what you want (yes it works in nautilus too):
[03:59] <ubotu> matt____: maybe this will do what you want (yes it works in nautilus too):: Kubuntu Edgy has implemented a new feature that hides most of the filesystem. For more information: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuHiddenFiles
[03:59] <enyc> brohken: you can configure edgy to auto-do- security-updates if you like
[03:59] <oxygenthief> hey
[03:59] <Slart> I can't remember enabling updates.... or.. did I???
[03:59] <brohken> is that in the gui or command line?
[04:00] <Slart> there is an update-manager
[04:00] <Slart> in the system-menu
[04:00] <matt____> for that
[04:00] <matt____> i would need to use kubuntu, wouldn't i?
[04:00] <brohken> how about updating from one version to the next? does it do that as well?
[04:00] <brohken> from say Dapper to Edgy
[04:00] <jrib> matt____: I've never used it, but the bottom of the page says it works in nautilus.  It also says it's only for /, but give it a try
[04:00] <enyc> brohken: no... and tnhe update notes for thta depend on the version....
[04:00] <oxygenthief> anyone able to tell me why ubuntu seems to be so slow loading pages
[04:01] <enyc> brohken: you can however do such an update...
[04:01] <y3it221_klce> can anyone give me the link for "Live Linux CDs" ebook??
[04:01] <jrib> matt____: http://linux.about.com/library/gnome/blgnome6n6r.htm
[04:01] <matt____> nautilus is like explorer in windows isn't it?
[04:02] <enyc> matt____: well thats one file borwser for gnome... not the only one
[04:02] <matt____> is it default?
[04:02] <jrib> matt____: yes
[04:02] <matt____> is it worth giving others a try?
[04:02] <oxygenthief> anyone know why ubuntu is so much slower than xp?
[04:02] <frogzoo> oxygenthief: dapper?
[04:03] <oxygenthief> yah
[04:03] <frogzoo> oxygenthief: upgrade to gnome/edgy - it's impressive the difference
[04:03] <Slart> brohken... I was wrong.. update-manager just updates... the settings for auto-downloading updates etc are in system/software-sources
[04:03] <jrib> matt____: I just tried the .hidden thing and it works fine here.  You can try thunar, but I think nautilus is probably the best for gnome (yes this is an opinion)
[04:04] <enyc> matt____: "xfe" is actually like windows explorer
[04:04] <eps> is there a ubuntu guide some where for mythtv installation ?
[04:04] <brohken> slart: in other words you need a seperate program to manage auto updating?
[04:04] <jrib> !mythtv | eps
[04:04] <ubotu> eps: MythTV is a TV framework for Linux - Instructions for using with Ubuntu at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV
[04:04] <eps> thx
[04:04] <matt____> how do i use the hidden thing for that lost folder?
[04:05] <Slart> brohken: well.. yes.. it's a separate program.. but it comes with Ubuntu... like Windows Update is a separate program in windows
[04:05] <oxygenthief> frogzoo: I am very new and still getting use to all the terms I'm using ubuntu 6.0 for sure if it is dapper or not
[04:05] <jrib> matt____: create a .hidden file in /data and put the name of the directory in there
[04:05] <brohken> gotcha
[04:05] <brohken> good enough for me
[04:05] <rausb0> oxygenthief: there is no ubuntu 6.0
[04:05] <matt____> as in a text file, and then put the name of the directory in the text file?
[04:05] <jrib> matt____: yes
[04:06] <frogzoo> oxygenthief: 6.0 is very old - 2 releases behind edgy
[04:06] <x06vh> How do I set VLC as my standard instead of Totem for movies etc?
[04:06] <Slart> Slart: and the best part is.. it updates Ubuntu.. AND any software you have installed...  (if you installed it the usual way)
[04:06] <jrib> !defaultapp | x06vh
[04:06] <ubotu> x06vh: To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties -> Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror -> Settings -> Configure and then hit "File Associations"
[04:06] <Slart> eh..talking to myself, am I
[04:06] <Hoag> Can anyone recommend a chat program such as gAIM that supports webcam?
[04:06] <matt____> it works
[04:06] <Slart> brohken:  : and the best part is.. it updates Ubuntu.. AND any software you have installed...  (if you installed it the usual way)
[04:06] <elkbuntu> Hoag, amsn
[04:06] <matt____> and, now how COULD i access the .hidden file again?
[04:06] <matt____> enable hidden things??
[04:07] <Hoag> elkbuntu: Thanks :)
[04:07] <frogzoo> oxygenthief: 6.06 = dapper, 6.10 = edgy = latest
[04:07] <jrib> matt____: ctrl-h or show hidden files
[04:07] <matt____> WOW!
[04:07] <elkbuntu> Hoag, that's for msn only. i dont know for the other protocols
[04:07] <onepic> hi! I'm trying to modifying a bootup script in /etc/init.d/lvm but the changes are not being executed in the startup
[04:07] <jrib> matt____: magic :)
[04:07] <matt____> windows has a long way to go
[04:07] <matt____> ubuntu harder than windoows?
[04:07] <matt____> noway
[04:07] <oxygenthief> frogzoo: Thanks
[04:07] <Hoag> elkbuntu: That's fine :)
[04:07] <matt____> just has a little curve you have to learn
[04:07] <brohken> i mainly want ubuntu because of the XGL/Beryl software
[04:08] <brohken> it looks incredible
[04:08] <Slart> matt____: not if you start both from zero.. =)
[04:08] <matt____> thats true
[04:08] <matt____> how about this
[04:08] <matt____> i have onboard intel graphics
[04:08] <oxygenthief> frogzoo: can you tell me how to check which version I have
[04:08] <matt____> and a geforce 550fx
[04:08] <matt____> 5500
[04:08] <brohken> i hear you can pick up chicks using Beryl
[04:08] <matt____> when i try to use the card
[04:08] <brohken> they think it's "hot"
[04:08] <Slart> oxygenthief: about-box in the gui
[04:08] <matt____> it freezes up
[04:09] <matt____> if i simply install nvidia drivers
[04:09] <matt____> will the card work?
[04:09] <Alakazamz0r> what controls the rewrite of /etc/resolv.conf?
[04:09] <matt____> i can't "disable" the onboard in my bios
[04:09] <jrib> !enter | matt____
[04:09] <ubotu> matt____: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:09] <matt____> will do. if i install drivers for it, will the card work?
[04:10] <frogzoo> oxygenthief: lsb_release -a
[04:10] <frogzoo> brohken: you heard wrong
[04:11] <onepic> any help? please
[04:11] <brohken> frogzoo: no way
[04:11] <brohken> they like shiny things
[04:11] <Slart> onepic: I didn't see the question.. repeat?
[04:11] <onepic> hi! I'm trying to modifying a bootup script in /etc/init.d/lvm but the changes are not being executed in the startup
[04:12] <oxygenthief> it says it has 6.1 so is it just standardly slow. I love the os just not sur if I messed it up
[04:12] <onepic> I tried with a simple 'cat /proc/mounts' but nothing
[04:12] <fadey> Hello, everyone. Does anybody know how could I find out all IPs assigned by my dhcp server to people
[04:12] <brohken> starbucks. new york city is full of geeky chicks that are hot
[04:12] <Slart> onepic: oh.. that one.. I have no idea.. sorry
[04:12] <brohken> the idea is to keep their self-esteem low
[04:12] <brohken> they don't realize they're hot
[04:12] <brohken> and I can take advantage
[04:12] <brohken> using my shiny Beryl techniques

[04:23] <webwolf_27> has anyone gotten the realtek8185L wireless card to work on edgy?
[04:24] <ken> I am looking for multimedia playback. (.mp3, .avi, mpeg1-2-3, wmv, etc). Which is the most effective way? Totem-xine, Totem-gstream, or something else? How about something that doesn't require any external plugins? eg. VLC. Are there other such software available. And how would you rate VLC?
[04:24] <RoKFiT> yeah i doubt that fixes it
[04:25] <RoKFiT> and i can't find it
[04:25] <RoKFiT> i'm on kubuntu
[04:25] <webwolf_27> ken, vlc is good, but overblow for audio
[04:25] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: the docs suggest it as a fix...worth trying
[04:25] <RoKFiT> how do i install it
[04:25] <whyme> frogzoo: Tried it out, but I can't figure out how to make fcsctl be started *specifically* by the user fcadmin

[04:25] <webwolf_27> ken, what do you want to know
[04:26] <whyme> frogzoo: in /etc/init.d/ scripts, re my earlier q about getting a service to start at boot
[04:26] <ken> webwolf_27: overblow? What is that? I can't find it in Add/remove programs.
[04:26] <oxygenthief> thanks for the help
[04:27] <RoKFiT> so frogzoo, just install the stuff they list?
[04:27] <jenda> What can "/home/jenda/.setup30509: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" mean, given by a liflg .run file?

[04:28] <webwolf_27> ken, its in universe/multiverse. It's too big for just audio and can do so much more
[04:28] <webwolf_27> ken, mplayer
[04:28] <kupo> ken: go use vlc

[04:29] <ken> kupo: webwolf_27: I want a no frills multimedia player, that plays all formats + never causes much problems/ is incompatible with files. As VLC uses its own plugins to play these formats, i doubt that some of the files wouldn't play correctly in it. Have you guys experienced such problems?
[04:29] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: sure
[04:29] <RoKFiT> i have the packages installed already
[04:29] <RoKFiT> i have them installed

[04:32] <ken> kupo: "sure", could you please be a little more descriptive? Do you mean you have experienced problems with VLC? Than what else do you suggest?
[04:32] <whyme> frogzoo: ty
[04:32] <kupo> nothing else
[04:33] <kupo> just vlc
[04:33] <Isyth> kupo: pentium III 550mHz 128mb ram
[04:33] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: 'sudo dpkg --purge mp321 ; sudo apt-get install mpg123-esd'
[04:33] <kupo> you prolly should try the alternative install cd Isyth
[04:33] <RoKFiT> frogzoo: is it a cli mp3player?
[04:33] <kupo> how does the livecd run on it Isyth ? slow?
[04:33] <ken> kupo: Thank you
[04:33] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: no - a codec
[04:33] <Isyth> kupo: the Breezy live CD doesn't run at all and the Dapper one is quite slow but working.
[04:34] <kupo> yeah I would use the etch alternative cd
[04:34] <RoKFiT> couldn't find package
[04:34] <kupo> you'll have a ncurses based install menu
[04:34] <MasterLexx> the live cds on  laptop with 128mb ram are overkill
[04:34] <kupo> Isyth: if you can up to 256ram total it'll make a big difference
[04:35] <RoKFiT> frogzoo: couldn't find package
[04:35] <Isyth> kupo: maybe that'll work. But what's that you said about the alternative install?
[04:35] <RoKFiT> i'm on kubuntu edgy
[04:35] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: multiverse
[04:35] <terraco> so to fix the wine prob, where it wont open a windows program is there something I can do to fix it? Please and thank you.
[04:35] <defrysk> http://parker1.co.uk/satanic/installation
[04:35] <RoKFiT> it's enabled frogzoo
[04:35] <kupo> Isyth: its where you dl the isos on the website
[04:35] <kupo> its made for systems with less than 192 of ram
[04:36] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: dpkg -l libk3b2-mp3
[04:36] <Isyth> kupo: that might do the trick. I'm having some problems opening the laptop to see where the ram goes... I'm not used to laptops.
[04:36] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: nvm, dpkg -l libxine-extracodecs
[04:37] <Helpmeee> when i boot into Ubuntu i get this msg :
[04:37] <Helpmeee> API mismatch The nvidia kernel module has the version 1.0-7184, but in this X module has the verison 1.0-9631
[04:37] <whyme> frogzoo: does this look right to you?
[04:37] <RoKFiT> okay idk what just happened
[04:37] <Slart> Helpmeee: you can try downloading the driver install thingy from nvidia and run it.. it should fix it

[04:39] <oneseventeen> how do I prevent Ubuntu 6.10 from automatically adding DNS servers?  (The automatic DNS servers it finds rarely work for me...)
[04:39] <Roconda> hey, if I want to change the default grub, is it just changing the new one to the top? and if it doesnt boot will it  automaticly pick the grub the kernel below it?
[04:39] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: try 'sudo apt-get update ; dpkg -l libxine-extracodecs'
[04:39] <RoKFiT> frogzoo: libxine-extracodecs is already the newest version
[04:39] <whyme> frogzoo: that's ln -s /etc/rc5.d/S100fcsctl /etc/init.d/fcsctl
[04:40] <Helpmeee> Slart, kan du skicka lnk ?
[04:40] <Helpmeee> Jag hittar inte ;s
[04:40] <Slart> Helpmeee: mm... sure.. but lets keep it in english.. for the rest of the room
[04:40] <RoKFiT> okay now what
[04:40] <oneseventeen> Roconda: I'm a newbie to grub, but I thought when you change the default you are changing which one is highlighted by default, not the order of the boot options (but I could be wrong)
[04:41] <Slart> Helpmeee: 32bit or 64bit?
[04:41] <frogzoo> whyme: does fcsctl take 'start' as an arg?
[04:41] <Reilithion> I'm looking for a RAM editor with which I could debug frozen programs, get a look at the internals of things as they run, and -- I'll be honest -- cheating at Breakout.  ;-)  Anyone have any suggestions for a program/package that might meet my needs?
[04:41] <oneseventeen> How do I disable dynamic DNS?
[04:41] <whyme> frogzoo: yep

[04:42] <Roconda> oneseventeen: thanks for your help, but I need someone who is sure about it because I am talking about an server thats hosted in a dc
[04:42] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: dunno - you running latest amarok?
[04:42] <RoKFiT> yeah

[04:42] <oneseventeen> Roconda: ahh, nevermind then, good luck!
[04:42] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: try 1.4.4
[04:42] <whyme> frogzoo: oh, and it was ln -s /etc/init.d/fcsctl /etc/rc5.d/S100fcsctl
[04:42] <terraco> can i get so help on the flash player for firefox it wont install

[04:43] <Slart> Helpmeee: then run that file.. sudo sh NVIDIA... you should get a nice ncurses install program going
[04:43] <kupo> ncurses rox
[04:44] <terraco> to be honest I am not sure it comes with v6.06

[04:44] <Helpmeee> Slart, is thare a newer krtnel module for nvidia+

[04:45] <frogzoo> RoKFiT: I'm on 1.4.4
[04:45] <Helpmeee> ok
[04:45] <kupo> terraco: what version of ff?
[04:45] <Helpmeee> my kernel module is outdated
[04:46] <Slart> Helpmeee: just let the install program do it all

[04:56] <Helpmeee> slart, do you use nvidia?

[04:56] <Alakazamz0r> Anyone?
[04:57] <biotrox> tarzeau | i use ATI driver for 9600GT
[04:57] <Helpmeee> Slart, How about sending it to me ?:)
[04:57] <Slart> Helpmeee: no other error messages?
[04:57] <Alakazamz0r> Come on guys, i help people here so much, someone could at LEAST take a look at my post.
[04:57] <tarzeau> biotrox: which driver name? fglrx?
[04:57] <Slart> Helpmeee: it's the same you've downloaded from the site.. I don't know where the built module is.. and I'm using AMD64
[04:57] <Helpmeee> ah..
[04:58] <biotrox> tarzeau | how to check if it's fglrx
[04:58] <Slart> Helpmeee: but the install program finished alright? and you said "yes.. configure my x system"
[04:58] <tarzeau> biotrox: grep fglrx /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
[04:58] <Helpmeee> yep
[04:59] <Slart> Helpmeee: and it still doesn't work when you restart?
[04:59] <Slart> Helpmeee: same error?
[04:59] <Helpmeee> then it works :)
[04:59] <jasonong> hello
[04:59] <Helpmeee> But if I reboot my system
[04:59] <Helpmeee> Same error.
[04:59] <Slart> Helpmeee: hmm.. odd.. it shouldn't do that
[04:59] <Helpmeee> so when i want to boot into ubuntu i need to re-isntall nvidia drivers
[05:00] <biotrox> tarzeau | there's non fglrx
[05:00] <Slart> Helpmeee: it never did that for me.... did you do "sudo sh NVIDIA-" etc?
[05:00] <Helpmeee> Slart, odd stuff tend to happend to me all the time ;)
[05:00] <Helpmeee> yeah
[05:00] <Helpmeee> Installation starts after i Agree

[05:01] <x-r00t-x> hey . how do i stop fscking on starting ubuntu ?
[05:01] <jrib> !fsck | x-r00t-x
[05:01] <ubotu> x-r00t-x: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot

[05:03] <mo> Slart, http://artwizaleczapka.sourceforge.net/
[05:03] <dfcarney> Reilithion: what do you mean a "RAM hex editor"?  Do you want to be able to peek/poke values into RAM at a physical address?
[05:04] <Slart> mo: thanks.. I'll go look.. never heard of them before
[05:04] <mo> Slart, i think they are also called bitmap fonts...
[05:04] <garren> I've a probleme , maybe you could help me , I've installed Ati drivers and xgl, and now when i am on login screen , the screen resolution is 1600x1200 and in my xorg.conf there are only 1024x768 and 800x600 , how can i change my login-manager screen resolution please ?
[05:04] <renihs> i find it pretty offensive that ubuntu certifies hardware (expensive one) and doesnt even test/check it?
[05:04] <renihs> how can that be???
[05:05] <symbulos> oes anyone know hw to maudoes anyone know hw to maually configure a network so that the ip address is fetched using dhcp (no graphics)?

[05:05] <mo> Slart, but there must be a way to use them ;)
[05:05] <dfcarney> mrlinux: type 'man mount'

[05:06] <Slart> mo: there probably is.. I've never seen anything for bitmap fonts though... but someone else might have
[05:06] <terraco> E: clvm: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 3 is what I got when I did that shown in the site
[05:06] <dfcarney> mrlinux: 'mount' is the command that you want to use.  'man mount' will display the manual page on it.
[05:06] <gar-> any one have a guide of how to add 2 static ip adressess... to the box
[05:06] <mo> Slart, OK. maybe i should ask later...
[05:06] <mrlinux> k thanks
[05:06] <mpoz2> Hi. Some of my apps (oo.org, gimp,...) regularly flash in the taskbar (probably dm's URGENT hint) without any reason and _unstoppable_ by mouse. To stop the flashing I have to Alt-Tab to the window or (in case of oo.org) I even have to _close_ it. Is this problem known? (Using Dapper)
[05:06] <biotrox> tarzeau | any other suggestion how to check if my ATI driver successfully installed...
[05:07] <renihs> heh lol, nothing works at ubuntu :)
[05:07] <renihs> i wish i could find it funny
[05:07] <Slart> mo: why not ask the author, he/she is bound to know
[05:07] <mo> Slart, mybe i should do so.
[05:07] <Reilithion> dfcarney: Yeah, that's the basic functionality I'm after.  Some additional features would be nice.
[05:07] <Reilithion> I'm sure I'm not the first one to think this up

[05:08] <x-r00t-x> !fsck | x-r00t-x

[05:08] <dfcarney> Reilithion: what's your intended application?  i.e. why do you want such a tool?
[05:09] <Reilithion> As I mentioned earlier, I want to be able to debug frozen programs and cheat at simple games.
[05:09] <mo> Slart, thanks. bye
[05:09] <dfcarney> Reilithion: ah, i didn't see that post.
[05:09] <Slart> Reilithion: mm.. something like artmoney.. but for linux.. would be nice =)

[05:10] <mo> Slart, he, it works :). i just had to restart X.
[05:10] <garren> does anyone know where can I change login screen resolution please ?
[05:10] <Reilithion> dfcarney: no worries.  Any suggestions?  Physical addresses don't matter so long as I could do a repeated search.

[05:11] <terraco> is ubuntu suposed to beable to reconize a CD/R DVD-ROM automaticly?
[05:11] <frogzoo> terraco: if it's ata, sure
[05:11] <Reilithion> Even just a pointer into another program's allocated memory could work.  I could almost write what I need myself in C or something.

[05:13] <renihs> WHO can i contact from ubuntu to ask WHY hardware has been CERTIFIED (by ubuntu) that does not work with ubuntu?
[05:14] <Slart> renihs: have you checked the official web-page?
[05:14] <renihs> yes, there are only some companies i could ask

[05:16] <Reilithion> dfcarney: Thanks for your help.  I'm a pretty good researcher if given a few leads.  I have a good idea of what it is I'm after, so could you chance giving me that misleading info so that I can decide for myself whether it's useful?
[05:16] <intrepidus> Can anyone tell me why, when I mount an NTFS drive, it only shows the following folders on it: AUTOEXEC.BAT, IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, CONFIG.SYS, RECYCLER, and System Volume Information?
[05:16] <biotrox> tarzeau | when i run your suggestion command. my computer hangs

[05:16] <intrepidus> The drive -does- have data on it, too.
[05:17] <whyme> frogzoo: the init.d script didn't work. any suggestions as how it can be improved/how I can debug it?
[05:17] <Samus_Aran> how do you turn off all kernel messages being output to the various TTYs ?  I use multiseat Xorg, and if stuff is output to the TTYs while locked in X, it writes that stuff overtop of the video memory and corrupts the X display
[05:17] <frogzoo> whyme: start the script with "#!/bin/bash -x" - then run the script as 'sudo /etc/rc2.d/S100fsctl'
[05:18] <Moosejaw> whats the command to open up the trash?
[05:18] <Samus_Aran> sometimes I can switch to TTY 12, which has no text output, but presently it won't let me go past TTY 8, which has lots of text output to it
[05:18] <phiwum> Gnumeric's colors are utterly screwy.  When I try to select the color for the background of a cell, every non-black option is a near invisible grey.  I've used gnumeric before (on Slackware) but never seen this problem.  Any ideas?
[05:19] <markeib> hey, ubuntu won't change anything when i try to change my theme, is this a common issue?
[05:19] <phiwum> I can choose a custom color and that comes out fine.  But the stock colors are screwy.

[05:19] <whyme> frogzoo: oh hey, it had a space between #! and /bin/bash.... d'oh!
[05:20] <Moosejaw> anyone?  command to open up the trash?
[05:20] <whyme> doesn't meen it'll work, but still....
[05:20] <whyme> Moosejaw:
[05:20] <Moosejaw> or is it just opening the trash file?
[05:20] <mrlinux> i cant mount my secondary hard drive
[05:20] <whyme> Moosejaw: the trash is a folder called .Trash in your home directory
[05:20] <Moosejaw> k
[05:20] <whyme> so it would be nautilus ~/.Trash
[05:21] <dfcarney> Reilithion: Hmmmm...  I still say that you start by reviewing 'gdb'.  Most debugging tools are based off of it.
[05:21] <Reilithion> whyme: depends on what desktop system he's running, or at least which file browser he has installed
[05:21] <whyme> unless you've been deleting on an external device, in which case it'll be .Trash on that device: cd /media/mydevice/.Trash
[05:21] <Juftus> intrepidus: perhaps the drive you're trying to mount has several partitions on it and you're just mounting one of them... for example, my laptop has two 'windows' partitions even though only one is visible from windows, and the hidden one containts something like 'system volume information'.
[05:21] <mrlinux> can i have some help with my mounting problem i have 2 file systems on the hard dirve(ext3, fat32)
[05:21] <whyme> Moosejaw: oh yea, this is assuming you're running vanilla ubuntu
[05:22] <dfcarney> Reilithion: If you're not compiling your own code then it can be a lot tricker.  You may also want to look into reverse-engineering documentation

[05:23] <ubuntu> hey
[05:23] <ubuntu> help
[05:23] <renihs> mkay i have written canonical an email but this is really shamefull for ubuntu (could it get any lower?) to certify systems and then ubuntu does not run on it
[05:24] <jrib> ubuntu: hey, ask a question and we'll try to help
[05:24] <whyme> frogzoo: it says http://pastebin.ca/280041
[05:24] <Juftus> intrepidus, OK. Just thought your situation might be similar to mine... No idea, then.
[05:24] <whyme> ubuntu: whatcha want?
[05:24] <ubuntu> jrib man
[05:24] <dfcarney> renihs: I'm just tuning in...  Where does it say that the system is certified?
[05:24] <ubuntu> i try to open a directory and told me

[05:24] <drkm> what do I have install through apt-get to get UUDECODE.. a program I'm installing needs it..
[05:25] <Juftus> intrepidus, what do you have in your /media (the hda? ones)?

[05:25] <ubuntu> Yo don't have a permission necessary to view the contents
[05:25] <ubuntu> jrib man what that mean
[05:25] <ubuntu> and how can i change it .

[05:29] <Juftus> OK. No prob. Sorry I can't help.

[05:30] <x-r00t-x> its up for me :-W
[05:30] <whyme> no reason, lol, but messing with menu.lst can sometimes be disasterous(sp?) if you're not careful
[05:30] <Gamentine> can anyone tell me where i can change the eth device enumeration?
[05:30] <dfcarney> renihs: Just reading through the various pages...gimme a sec...

[05:31] <tuna-fish-> weird
[05:31] <FernandoCordes> tuna-fish-: kinda strange.. for me it works too
[05:31] <renihs> dfcarney, just search for canonical
[05:31] <x-r00t-x> tuna-fish-, maybe your port are blocked for ssl ...
[05:31] <FernandoCordes> tuna-fish-: you not on some kind of internet cafe or college network or so?
[05:31] <whyme> frogzoo: whenever I try the command it just returns sudo: /etc/rc2.d/S100fcsctl: command not found
[05:31] <tuna-fish-> college network but I have used them before
[05:31] <FernandoCordes> maybe they blocked em :-) bad linux
[05:32] <tuna-fish-> just shows a blank page on firefox
[05:32] <tuna-fish-> I very much doubt
[05:32] <renihs> Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 64-bit (canonical certified)
[05:32] <x-r00t-x> tuna-fish-, that mean your port is blocked ....
[05:32] <renihs> i tracked the problem and its simply a broken kernel/gcc stuff
[05:32] <whyme> frogzoo: ??? which is strange as I used tab completion to get the command line there in the first place, and it's deffo linked to the right file, as per less /etc/rc2.d/S100fcsctl...
[05:32] <renihs> i know only hope that it works with (LOL) i386
[05:32] <tuna-fish-> x-r00t-x: what?
[05:33] <renihs> its anyway *complete* madness for ubuntu to use gcc-4.0 which is known to be broken
[05:33] <FernandoCordes> tuna-fish-: sure! bill came to your college and said he will suck **** of your headmaster if he would blacklist it
[05:33] <x-r00t-x> tuna-fish-, your ssl port is blocked . that why you cant see the page
[05:33] <renihs> on their long term support edition, but i dont care about that
[05:33] <bradley> my theme manager doesn't seem to load the controls of installed themes. has anyone else had this problem? what is the fix?
[05:33] <tuna-fish-> now it started working. weird indeed
[05:33] <x-r00t-x> lol FernandoCordes
[05:33] <x-r00t-x> tuna-fish-, w*f?
[05:33] <renihs> what i do care about is that the important stuff is broken too (like the modules i need)
[05:33] <FernandoCordes> x-r00t-x nvm -_-
[05:34] <dfcarney> renihs: well, assuming that you've followed the instructions in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Amd64 , I suggest that you post on http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=134; to see if anyone else has had similar problems

[05:34] <x-r00t-x> hmm :P FernandoCordes
[05:34] <renihs> dfcarney, i did, they get delted
[05:34] <renihs> deleted
[05:34] <renihs> dissapear i mean :)
[05:34] <dfcarney> renihs: really? that's odd.  no reason was given?
[05:34] <FernandoCordes> tuna-fish-: awesome. they using gnu on your college?
[05:35] <tuna-fish-> part
[05:35] <whyme> frogzoo: it does work if I sudo sh /etc/rc2.d/S100fcsctl... trying again, standby :)
[05:35] <tuna-fish-> many workstations are windows
[05:35] <renihs> dfcarney, not that i know about, but there is one posting describing the same problem
[05:35] <renihs> no answer on that since quite some time
[05:35] <dfcarney> renihs: yeah, i saw that
[05:36] <jenda> How can I rename a single file in an ISO?
[05:36] <Moosejaw> i am trying to add a trashcan to StarterBar in gdesklets...how can i get this done so it opens?
[05:36] <dfcarney> jenda: i don't think it's possible.  you'll need to expand the .ISO, rename it, and re-pack it.
[05:36] <renihs> tja, how am i going to explain to the (wanna have ubuntu) customer that ubuntu doesnt work on ubuntu certified hardware....this is really really ugly now
[05:36] <renihs> bah :(
[05:37] <renihs> and good question since that company bought 8x x4100
[05:37] <dfcarney> renihs: I agree -- it sucks.
[05:37] <renihs> which is quite alot money
[05:37] <mrabbit> hi, torrent downloads on ubuntu are so slow, azureus is configured just as on suse which worked fine on this laptop, the router is set fine, yet my speeds are slow on all torrents
[05:37] <richee> anyone know how I can upgrade modules
[05:37] <jenda> ok
[05:37] <Gamentine> does anyone know where i can modify the eth device enumerations? eth1=>eth0
[05:38] <eltech> whats the easiest way to boot to a prompt and not X?
[05:38] <dfcarney> renihs: Well, if they're paying that much then maybe they'd consider a support contract with Canonical for x4100 support.  I'm not saying that it'll go over well, but it's an option.
[05:38] <whyme> mrabbit: how long has it been?
[05:38] <biotrox> please take a look at this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37199/ and give acomment cause i don't understand this
[05:39] <mrabbit> whyme:what do you mean? i've been using ubutu 6.10 for a week, and its been slow on torrents for all that time, ktorrent is also slow
=== joakim is now known as Skyrunner
[05:40] <dfcarney> eltech: if you always want to boot to a prompt, you can disable gdm from starting up.  Something like "sudo update-rc.d -f gdb remove" should do the trick...  Though be careful with that command.
[05:40] <renihs> dfcarney, hehe thats not an option
[05:40] <dfcarney> eltech: rather "sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove"
[05:40] <renihs> if canonical says yet it works and it doesnt, i cannot explain the customer to buy additional support to make supported stuff working
[05:40] <mrlinux> kapilg_it, i cant private message
[05:41] <dfcarney> renihs: I agree -- if they say that something is supported and, clearly, it isn't then they should either change their statement or fix it.
[05:41] <heiko> is there a known problem where wlan fails to work after ugrade from edgy to feisty?
[05:41] <dfcarney> renihs: problem being is that most Linux developers have never seen an x4100, let alone worked on one.
[05:41] <whyme> mrabbit: have you tried a different torrent client - see if it's an azureus pbm or not?
[05:42] <kapilg_it> mrlinux: does it show up in sudo fdisk -l
[05:42] <mrlinux> kapilg_it, yes
[05:42] <mrabbit> whyme:just said, ktorrent is just as slow, can usually get an average of 50kb/s on windows/suse(dont use suse anymore) but on ubuntu im lucky to get 20kb/s
[05:42] <mrlinux> kapilg_it, hdb1 and hdb2
[05:42] <adaran> anyone have an idea where to look for alsa docs? the dev docs are no good if you don't have detailed knowledge about soundcards and i don't want to read another "guide to compiling the alsa kernel module". i need something that explains the concepts (what's a card, what's pcm, etc) as understood by alsa. any ideas?
[05:42] <renihs> dfcarney, yes but then it cannot be *certified*!
[05:43] <ox> hi, where's a good place to start on installing xgl/compiz on dapper on dell inspiron 5100?
[05:43] <renihs> canonical cannot certify hardware they have never seen can they?
[05:43] <kapilg_it> mrlinux: what fs type does it show
[05:43] <renihs> i mean, "can" ...ofc they "can"
[05:43] <renihs> dfcarney, http://www.ubuntu.com/sun

[05:44] <renihs> i doubt any of those system works since they all have the same controller (most of them)
[05:44] <mrlinux> kapilg_it, hdb1 is hpfs  hdb2 is ext3
[05:44] <dfcarney> renihs: well, what can I say?  Someone screwed up and didn't test things properly.
[05:45] <kapilg_it> mrlinux : then mount -t ext3 device /media/whereToMount
[05:45] <whyme> frogzoo: loool at me n00bishness - the /etc/init.d/ file wasn't chmod +x .... *sigh* guess I can simply help myself if I RTFM and use my brain. ty anyway ^_^
[05:45] <dfcarney> dfcarney: If I had an x4100 available then I wouldn't mind trying to fix things.
[05:45] <mrabbit> whyme:please help, this torrent gained 3.0% in 7 hours
[05:45] <kapilg_it> mrlinux : make directories hdb1 and hdb2 in /media
[05:45] <renihs> dfcarney, just one more thing, plz take a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Amd64
[05:45] <renihs> and tell me that only a *single* sentence makes *any* sence
[05:46] <whyme> mrabbit: you on kde then I gather? What about the native torrent client?
[05:46] <renihs> thats complete jebrish
[05:46] <renihs> THOSE instructions i just POSTED?
[05:46] <mrlinux> kapilg_it, thx
[05:46] <kapilg_it> mrlinux: then fire command "sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb2 /media/hdb2
[05:46] <mrabbit> whyme:im on gnome, but i prefer azureus, as i said ive tried ktorrent and its also slow
[05:46] <renihs> those are instructions which makes NO SENSE at all
[05:46] <dfcarney> dfcarney: I understand them...though they're a bit cryptic.
[05:47] <whyme> I use az as well, and don't have problems getting over 1MB/s
[05:47] <renihs> dabaR_, plz show me ONE sentence in those "instructions" which makes ANY sense
[05:47] <dfcarney> renihs:  I understand them...though they're a bit cryptic.
[05:47] <renihs> dfcarney, omg???
[05:47] <renihs> dfcarney, PRE-INSTALLATION: Make sure the BIOS is not configured to boot off the ATAPI CD-ROM. Instead, it should boot off the hard disk.
[05:47] <renihs> LOL????
[05:47] <renihs> LOOOOOL?
[05:47] <kapilg_it> mrlinux : add /modify lines in /etc/fstab so that you get them after every boot
[05:47] <dfcarney> renihs: (I worked for an OS company for 4 years and spent some of my time on certification)
[05:47] <renihs> first sentence
[05:47] <Pons> how the hell is feisty's kernel 2.6.20-1.1 if last kernel's.org stable is 2.6.19.1?
[05:47] <dabaR_> renihs: how about go for a walk to chill out, get a cup of coffee, eat some lunch, and come back relaxed and ask a support question.
[05:47] <mrlinux> ok
[05:47] <renihs> dabaR_, lol
[05:48] <renihs> dont bet in future, i guess you are going to lose always
[05:48] <renihs> me reads instructions :)
[05:48] <whyme> all I can say is go through the wizard, check the advanced option, then go through the entire thing. Folloing that, restart all your networking equipment, making 3xsure that it's all setup correctly.... that's what I do when I get problems, and it's never failed yet.
[05:48] <renihs> just the instructions are written by someone who has no clue at all from linux
[05:49] <Reilithion> anyone or dfcarney: Okay, it looks like gdb mostly either stops execution of the program in order to do its thing, or uses some kind of remote tracepoints system to interface with pieces of code designed specifically for debugging.  I'm looking for something that can search and replace values in RAM on the fly, basically as the program runs.
[05:49] <dfcarney> renihs: Are you kidding?  I don't think they're too bad at all.  Sure, they could use more detail, but it's certainly a start.
[05:49] <mrabbit> somebody please help with my slow torrents, its driving me up the wall
=== kald is now known as lassegs
[05:50] <cloom> t
[05:51] <Reilithion> Any more leads out there?
[05:51] <dfcarney> renihs: I could help you through those instructions if you like.
[05:51] <jmgalian> hola
[05:51] <anorexicpillow> i find ktorrent rather slow
[05:51] <dfcarney> Reilithion: sorry, but I can't think of much more to offer.  Messing around with a process's memory is trick business
[05:52] <Reilithion> anorexicpillow: me too.  i use bittornado myself
[05:52] <renihs> dfcarney, i have my own linux distribution, i know what i am doing
[05:52] <renihs> dfcarney, but those instructions are full of spelling errors and make no sense, plz explain me what
[05:52] <Reilithion> dfcarney: Thanks anyway.  I'll keep looking around.
[05:52] <renihs> dfcarney, what this means: (PRE-INSTALL): Make sure the BIOS is not configured to boot off the ATAPI CD-ROM. Instead, it should boot off the hard disk.
[05:53] <dfcarney> Reilithion: one problem that you're going to have to overcome is that a process will map its RAM to a virtual address space
[05:53] <renihs> dfcarney, how am i supposed to install if i disable cdrom?
[05:53] <renihs> btw, why are there spelling errors?
[05:53] <renihs> (off instead of)
[05:53] <garren> does anyone know where can I change login screen resolution please ?
[05:53] <renihs> dfcarney, if you can explain this sentence you are my god
[05:54] <dfcarney> renihs: if you read above, it says "This install uses the netboot method as described in Installation/Netboot."
[05:54] <Lynoure> renihs: off as in synonym of from.
[05:54] <renihs> off=from?
[05:54] <renihs> where?
[05:54] <dfcarney> renihs: Do you know what netbooting is?
[05:54] <renihs> in the us?
[05:54] <renihs> dfcarney, mkay, you are right
[05:55] <jrib> renihs, dfcarney: it may make sense to make the Installation/Netboot a link though
[05:55] <Lynoure> renihs: "boot off the hard disk" I do not know, semicommon geekese.
[05:55] <renihs> anyhow, the rest of the instructions doesnt make more sense neither
[05:55] <dfcarney> renihs: I admit, there *should* be instructions describing how to install off of a CD.
[05:55] <renihs> Make sure to note the first hard disk for the next section. (one is supposed to be in bios at this step=
=== Gamentine is now known as Gamentine|Gone
[05:55] <renihs> what does it help to note the first hard disk in bios?
[05:55] <renihs> the id?
[05:55] <renihs> or what? :)
[05:55] <renihs> boot of the hard disk?
[05:56] <dfcarney> renihs: Probably the SCSI ID so that you can correlate it to a device name.
[05:56] <renihs> i would say :) never have seen boot off
[05:56] <renihs> dfcarney, ah :) which isnt explained how :) an not advanced user will never manage that
[05:56] <dfcarney> renihs: Basically, you need to manually configure grub so that it'll install on the correct device
[05:56] <renihs> i know
[05:56] <renihs> but i find this howto ....crappy
[05:56] <renihs> :)
[05:56] <abarbaccia> hello all, how would i write a stream from STDIN to a file on the command line if i need su privileges to edit the file?
[05:56] <renihs> pointless too :)
[05:57] <dfcarney> renihs: Oh, I agree.  It's not too good at all.
[05:57] <abarbaccia> I can't just use the >
[05:57] <dfcarney> renihs: That's what happens when developers write documentation :)
[05:57] <renihs> hmm i doubt a dev has written that :)
[05:57] <renihs> devs usually go deeper into the matters
[05:57] <jrib> abarbaccia: pipe to sudo tee
[05:57] <abarbaccia> jrib: thanks
[05:57] <dfcarney> renihs: Well, someone who's all-too-familiar with the process wrote it (in a hurry).
[05:57] <psusi> abarbaccia: sudo 'foo > file' iirc
[05:58] <iami89> who there know about VMware?
[05:59] <dfcarney> iami89: I know a bit.  What's your question?
[05:59] <piggyg1> me
[05:59] <piggyg1> Yeah whats your question
[06:00] <iami89> how to change total memory of VGA in win ME from 2mb up to 16mb or more than that?
=== xitrox is now known as xitrox|afk
[06:01] <burepe> I got Japanese installed and when I want to use Japanese I just log in in Japanese, but my friend wants to know how to type in Japanese in the English gui. I know you can install everything you need in the language support settings by choosing Japanese, but how do I get the SCIM (?) started in the English gui?
[06:01] <iami89> hey

[06:02] <dfcarney> iami89: I'm unclear as to what you're asking.  You're running VMware under Linux (Ubuntu), right?  You want to increase the amount of RAM allocated to a particular instance?
[06:02] <VSpike> !seveas
[06:02] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[06:02] <floris84> hi!
[06:03] <l3mr> whenever i try to go to console mode in the login manager, i just get a black/blank screen... help!
[06:03] <floris84> while running an application it says a certain file needs to be in my command search path, what is that and how do I add it?
[06:03] <iami89> under Linux(Ubuntu) is true but i want to increase ram of Graphic card(default is 2mb)
[06:04] <Pons> how the hell is feisty's kernel 2.6.20-1.1 if last kernel's.org stable is 2.6.19.1?
[06:04] <jensen> anyone can point me towards some kind of replacement for nautilus for connecting to remote ssh servers?
[06:04] <eltech> whats the package that is required so i can install sysv-rc-conf
[06:04] <DShepherd> Pons, ask in ubuntu+1
[06:04] <eltech> trying to install it
[06:05] <bradley> when i run theme-manager in a terminal i get this warning (gnome-theme-manager:8187): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap" and i can't load the controls of the themes that i installed. how would i fix this?
[06:05] <floris84> @jensen maybe konqueror?
[06:05] <psusi> Pons: because edgy isn't stable?
[06:05] <psusi> err, feisty rather
[06:05] <y3it221_klce> i need HOWTOs for creating a live CD
[06:05] <jensen> floris84, konqueror got a filebrowser like nautilus?
[06:05] <dfcarney> iami89: That's a good question.  I've never needed to do that.  Let me poke around and see what I can find.
[06:05] <jrib> Pons: it's not stable?
[06:06] <floris84> @jensen konqueror is the filebrowser for KDE
[06:06] <Pons> psusi, but, by putting this kernel as 2.6.20 (unexistant yet) they mean it stable
[06:06] <jrib> Pons: feisty questions should go to #ubuntu+1 though
[06:06] <floris84> I liked it when I worked under kde
[06:06] <iami89> ok lets try it
[06:06] <Pons> jrib, http://www.kernel.org
[06:06] <dabaR_> y3it221_klce: http://www.gnewsense.org/Builder/HowToCreateYourOwnGNULinuxDistribution
[06:06] <jrib> Pons: yes?
[06:06] <jensen> floris84, alright, thanks -- I'll give it a shot.. hopefully that does not have the same bugs ;)
[06:06] <floris84> what happens then?
[06:06] <klm-> can anyone find w32codecs in their repo's?
[06:07] <dabaR_> Pons: show where it says that is the ubuntu feisty kernel, the .20...
[06:07] <y3it221_klce> dabaR_: ThankU very much, can i get some more.
[06:07] <dfcarney> iami89: Which VMware product are you using?  Which version?
[06:07] <enric> hi... what is the best IRC client for ubuntu? one with dcc transfer features?
[06:07] <Pons> http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/allpackages.en.txt.gz
[06:07] <dabaR_> klm-: no, it is in a separate repo.
[06:07] <VSpike> if I do an "apt-get update" at the moment, I end up looking at "99% [Waiting for headers] " and nothing else happens. Is something down somewhere?
[06:07] <klm-> dabaR_: where?
[06:07] <Pons> linux-image-2.6.20-1-386 (2.6.20-1.1) Linux kernel image for version 2.6.20 on i386
[06:07] <Pons> linux-image-2.6.20-1-generic (2.6.20-1.1) Linux kernel image for version 2.6.20 on x86/x86_64
[06:07] <jensen> floris84, there is a load of annoying bugs in nautilus unresolved upstream that makes it impossible working on remote ssh servers
[06:08] <floris84> that's too bad, however I never had any trouble with it
[06:08] <Dandre> hello,
[06:08] <nasso> does anyone know how i can convert vob-files to an iso?
[06:08] <dabaR_> !find linux-image feisty

[06:08] <nasso> i have a VIDEO_TS folder that i want as a iso
[06:08] <Dandre> I haven't found how to install/activate diff plugin for gedit
[06:08] <dabaR_> !find linux-image-2.6.20 feisty
[06:08] <ubotu> Found: linux-image-2.6.20-1-386, linux-image-2.6.20-1-generic, linux-image-2.6.20-1-server, linux-image-2.6.20-1-server-bigiron, linux-image-2.6.20-1-lowlatency
[06:08] <DShepherd> anyone know where I which channel i can go to find out compiz stuff on ubuntu?
[06:08] <jensen> floris84, : I had not untill I started using dapper/edgy
[06:09] <piggyg1> any luck with increasing video memory?
[06:09] <jensen> floris84, : apparently it only affects certain remote servers with certain versions of sshd
[06:09] <omegadar> anyone here running world of warcraft with wine ?
[06:09] <piggyg1> i would like to know how to do that too
[06:09] <y3it221_klce> dabaR_: i guess the link is only for customization
[06:09] <y3it221_klce> can u please give me links for creating linux live cd from scratch
[06:10] <dabaR_> y3it221_klce: of what?
[06:10] <dabaR_> klm-: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/pool/edgy-seveas/extras/w32codecs_20060611-0.0_i386.deb
[06:10] <floris84> @jensen hmm well let's hope konqueror doesn't have that problem
[06:10] <floris84> @jensen GoodLuck
[06:10] <klm-> ok thanks. that probably works on dapper too?
[06:10] <y3it221_klce> daba_R: i need ebooks/HOWTOs for creating a live CD from scratch....not customizing an already present Live CD
[06:11] <jensen> floris84, thanks, else I'll have to go back to some ancient ubuntu version or another distro :(
[06:11] <dabaR_> klm-: ya, it is the same package for all versions of ubuntu, or even debian
[06:11] <n2diy> My mouse broke, and Ubuntu isn't playing with my new one, how do I navigate to the menus with out a mouse?
[06:11] <iami89> is anybody here know how to convert NTFS driver 2 EXT3 without lost data?
[06:11] <piggyg1> daba_R: can I have a the ebook on customizing?
[06:12] <pantalaimon_> iami89, make a backup copy, format to ext3, then copy it back :)
[06:12] <dabaR_> y3it221_klce: there exists no such thing. It would be a diff process for rpm vs. gentoo vs. deb distros, and all that. Read that page til you understand what it really does, then look for other info.
[06:12] <dfcarney> iami89: there's no conversion tool for that.  You'll need to copy the data somewhere else, then reformat your partition.
[06:12] <dabaR_> piggyg1: can you scroll up?
[06:12] <dabaR_> http://www.gnewsense.org/Builder/HowToCreateYourOwnGNULinuxDistribution
[06:12] <munckfish> Hi, I'm updating a Dapper package to add a wee bit of functionality. What's the best way of tweaking the version number so that I don't conflict with real Ubuntu packages?
[06:12] <piggyg1> dabaR_: sure
[06:12] <psusi> iami89: I assume you meant to say convert an ntfs partition ( not driver ) to ext... you backup, format, and restore...
[06:13] <y3it221_klce> dabaR_: thanks
[06:13] <psusi> munckfish: appent '0local' to the version
[06:13] <psusi> append even
[06:13] <munckfish> psusi: great thx
[06:14] <munckfish> psusi: is that in some policy doc somewhere?
[06:14] <psusi> munckfish: probably
[06:14] <dfcarney> iami89: From what I've found on the web, it seems that VMware is shipped with only one "virtual video adapter"...  Though there are some references to multiple adapters for their "GSX" product line.
[06:14] <iami89> nope, i think i've heared somewhere that we can convert them direct without lost any data but i forgot
[06:14] <iami89> is anyone here heard about that?
[06:14] <MasseR> ANyone here using audacious? How come it doesn't play mp3?
[06:15] <n2diy> My mouse broke, and Ubuntu isn't playing with my new one, how do I navigate to the menus with out a mouse?
[06:15] <renihs> iami89, its very easy to convert a physical machine to vmware if you know how
[06:15] <psusi> iami89: there is no such tool to my knowlege
[06:15] <renihs> but for those who do not know how there is a tool
[06:15] <renihs> p2v, physical to virtual
[06:15] <renihs> crappy and expensive
[06:15] <renihs> doesnt work but its there
[06:16] <munckfish> psusi: ok thx (Y)
[06:16] <renihs> i converted more than 100 nt4 workstations and a couple of 2k and 2k3 to vmware meanwhile, using free tools only
[06:16] <myno> does anyone know a good extenction for firefox wich translates from english to italian?
[06:17] <renihs> myno, get yourself stardict
[06:17] <iami89> where're downloaded files which i use apt-get to download?
[06:17] <renihs> it can translate anyhting (application independend)
[06:17] <renihs> by marking it with mouse
[06:17] <myno> thanks very much renihs
[06:17] <dabaR_> iami89: /var/cache/apt/archives
[06:17] <nolimitsoya> iami89, why do you want to know? :) in most cases you shouldnt have to care about that
[06:18] <myno> yes i wanted sonething like that
[06:18] <myno> something
[06:18] <iami89> thanks
[06:19] <iami89> i am going to reinstall my linux
[06:19] <mountainrebel> i'm trying to download libdvdcss and w32codecs, but the plf repositories are down and i can't find ubuntu packages anywhere.  can anyone help?
[06:19] <eltech> what can i use to choose to load services on boot? like xorg or gnome?
[06:19] <dabaR_> mountainrebel: edgy or dapper?
[06:19] <nolimitsoya> iami89, you might want to take a peek at apt-on-cd
[06:20] <mountainrebel> dabaR_: edgy
[06:20] <nceterval> Hello, I'm having trouble upgrading from Dapper to Edgy using apt.  I changed my sources to the new repository, but the dist-upgrade failed.  I tried apt-get -f install and get the following error: http://pastebin.ca/280096    What can I do to fix this and complete the upgrade?
[06:20] <iami89> but my internet connection is 512/256 and its so slow to download all the things i've downloaded
[06:20] <pike_> nceterval: have you apt-get update  yet?
[06:20] <dabaR_> mountainrebel: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/edgy-seveas/extras/
[06:20] <nolimitsoya> iami89, thats exactly why you want aptoncd. then you can use a cd-rw as a repo
[06:20] <nceterval> pike_, Yes :)
[06:21] <mountainrebel> dabaR_: thanks, i'll check it out!
[06:22] <iami89> nope, the things i've downloaded not on cd

[06:23] <matt____> how can i mount an iso file?
[06:23] <dfcarney> matt____: with the 'mount' command
[06:23] <emilia> hey guys, my desktop isnt showing items in /home/myusername/desktop, and i cant right click on my desktop either
[06:23] <nolimitsoya> matt____, sudo mount -o loop /<file> /<dir>
[06:23] <eltech> only gui users here i guess :-(
[06:23] <dfcarney> matt____: type 'man mount' for more info :)
[06:23] <nolimitsoya> eltech, ?
[06:24] <eltech> what can i use to choose to load services on boot? like xorg or gnome? i dont want X
[06:24] <LjL> Ubotu, tell eltech about boot | eltech, see the private message from Ubotu
[06:24] <FernandoCordes> blow the whistle
[06:24] <nolimitsoya> eltech, im not sure im with you... you want to do what?
[06:24] <floris84> if I have an input driver for xfree will it work under xorg?
[06:24] <lassegs> eltech, i saw a guide on that some time a go... let me check for to seconds.
[06:24] <eltech> i want to boot to a promt .. shell
[06:25] <eltech> no X no gdm
[06:25] <nolimitsoya> eltech, just remove gdm
[06:25] <frogzoo> !iso | matt____
[06:25] <ubotu> matt____: To mount an ISO disc image, type "sudo mount -o loop my.iso <mountpoint>" There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before burning.
[06:25] <lassegs> eltech, but you want to keep gdm as an option?
[06:25] <dfcarney> eltech: most of the pre-X stuff is controlled by entries in the /etc/init.d and /etc/rc?.d directories.
[06:25] <dfcarney> eltech: as nolimitsoya said, remove/disable the gdm script to prevent X from starting.
[06:25] <nceterval> pike_, Did you have a look at the error on pastebin?
[06:25] <_Rebecca> Anyone else having streaming audio issues with Mplayer?
[06:26] <nceterval> pike_, It's probably simple to understand, but I don't know enough.
[06:26] <lassegs> _Rebecca, what kind of issues?
[06:26] <eltech> remove from where?
[06:26] <pike_> nceterval: just did.  what does you /etc/environment say
[06:26] <dfcarney> eltech: the command "sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove" will do the trick, though be really careful with that command.
[06:26] <eltech> using update-rc.d?
[06:26] <matt____> i did sudo mount -o (file) /media
[06:26] <matt____> now, how can i unmount it?
[06:26] <_Rebecca> lassegs I did a system update, and my streaming audio stopped working
[06:26] <nceterval> pike_, PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games" LANG="en_US.UTF-8" LANGUAGE="en"
[06:26] <dfcarney> matt____: umount /media
[06:26] <_Rebecca> lassegs it was working fine before I updated
[06:26] <nolimitsoya> matt____, substitute mount for umount
[06:27] <nolimitsoya> matt____, you realy shouldnt mount in /media, but in an empty subdir
[06:27] <lassegs> _Rebecca, when you start mplayer from a terminal, does it give you an error message?
[06:27] <l3mr> i can't seem to find docu on the (for me) weird UUID-harddisk descriptors used in edgy instead of good old /dev/sda1 and so... anyknow know a link?
[06:27] <dfcarney> nolimitsoya: good point
[06:27] <matt____> i will remember that
[06:27] <eltech> ok\
[06:28] <matt____> what exactly do i type to unmount it?
[06:28] <lassegs> matt____, sudo umount <dir>
[06:28] <nolimitsoya> l3mr, what do you want to know? the uuid is a unique number for every partition, so you can move discs around interfaces and still boot without changing your fstab every time
[06:28] <mnoir> matt____: start with man umount
[06:28] <dfcarney> l3mr: "udevinfo -e" will give you a tonne of info
[06:28] <_Rebecca> lassegs whats the mplayer command for starting it in the terminal?
[06:29] <nolimitsoya> l3mr, if you want to find the uuid for your partitions try blkid :)
[06:29] <l3mr> nolimitsoya, dfcarney ok, thanks alot guys!
[06:29] <nolimitsoya> _Rebecca, just 'mplayer'
[06:29] <pike_> nceterval: try dpkg-reconfigure locales  or just change all the values in environment to "" leaving PATH untouched
[06:29] <nolimitsoya> l3mr, np :)
[06:29] <eltech> didnt work
[06:29] <nceterval> pike_, OK, and then try apt-get -f install again?
[06:29] <raize> howdy, does ubuntu support the epson pm-a850 all-in-one?
[06:29] <eltech> the update-rc.d
[06:30] <lassegs> _Rebecca,  maybe you'll have to specify the file its supposed to stream when its started from a terminal. Then it should look like mplayer http://mediafileidliketostream.ogg or something
[06:30] <_Rebecca> lassegs, I don't appear to be getting any errors when starting from terminal
[06:30] <dfcarney> eltech: did you prefix the command with "sudo"?  What was the output?
[06:30] <matt____> what happens if i just delete everything in /media?
[06:30] <pike_> nceterval: jsut try maybe distupgrade
[06:30] <dfcarney> matt____: uh, bad things.
[06:30] <pike_> boss is watching gotta go :)
[06:31] <dabaR_> eltech: you ran sudo update-rc.d gdm remove?
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> matt____, youll loose loads of data, probably. and you wont be able to mount cd:S
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> *a
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> **s
[06:31] <mnoir> matt____: then /media would be empty
[06:31] <eltech> yea
[06:31] <dfcarney> matt____: Ubuntu makes a lot of assumptions about certain files and stuff being in directories like /media
[06:31] <dfcarney> mnoir: haha
[06:31] <eltech> gdm exists during rc.d purge
[06:31] <matt____> so, how do i unmount it? do i use sudo unmount /media?
[06:31] <eltech> use -f force
[06:31] <nceterval> pike_, Neither -f install or dist-upgrade worked :(
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> matt____, not unmount, but umount
[06:31] <nceterval> pike_, dist-upgrade recommends that I try -f for unment dependencies.
[06:31] <mnoir> dfcarney: well - he isn't demonstrating much understanding of the concept of mounting....
[06:32] <mnoir> :)
[06:32] <matt____> oh, that did it!
[06:32] <kane77> hi...
[06:32] <nolimitsoya> matt____, good thing :) next time you mount, use mkdir <name> to make an empty folder to mount in
[06:33] <nolimitsoya> !hi | kane77
[06:33] <ubotu> kane77: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:33] <eltech> think i got it.. -f after the command
[06:33] <kane77> I was wondering... is there any brainwave generator for linux??
[06:33] <FifaFrazer> hi.. anyone here using ktechlab?
[06:33] <l3mr> i've installed the nvidia binary drivers using the nvidia installer package, after apt-get remove --purge'ing the restricted modules package...it works immediately after i called the installed, but on next boot i get an incompatible API error when starting X, with the old version number ( the one from restricted modules ). I'm using edgy on amd64... any ideas?
[06:33] <matt____> would it be ok to mount it in /home/matt/cd?
[06:33] <FifaFrazer> what is brainwave?

[06:59] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, yes it is
[06:59] <globe> tabber: no, what you need to do is the option that gets all the depen. of a pkg

[07:01] <_Rebecca> richee, yep works fine
[07:01] <nolimitsoya> tabber, then someones messed up the repos. try 'sudo apt-get install -f'

[07:02] <drkm> globe: thanks
[07:02] <nolimitsoya> tabber, well, compiz-plugins is somehow not installable. someones fouled up the repo is my guess...
[07:03] <drkm> globe: nothing came up, does that means its not available through apt-get?
[07:03] <nolimitsoya> tabber, you can try sudo apt-get install compiz-plugins
[07:03] <nolimitsoya> drkimyou might be lacking the right repos. enable universe and multiverse, for starters
[07:03] <globe> drkm: no, not exactly, but it does mean that that package is not available in the repositories that you have selected.
[07:04] <nolimitsoya> drkm, you can also try /msg the bot the name of the package
[07:04] <tabber> nolimitsoya: i think the problem has to do with a "csm" package
[07:04] <tabber> it says: Package csm is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[07:04] <nolimitsoya> drkm, like so: '/msg ubotu info <package>'
[07:05] <drkm> ok thanks
[07:05] <nolimitsoya> tabber, might very well be. cant help you, esecialy since compiz is not part of ubuntu. the recommendation is to use beryl anyways
[07:06] <tabber> nolimitsoya: i was thinking, but the wiki says that beryl is somehow less stable, is that true?

[07:15] <nolimitsoya> dabaR_, ?
[07:15] <richee> jenniferj: que tal?
[07:16] <ady> I have installed some Ham Radio progs, but I cannot locate them in the menu, how do I access these programs?
[07:16] <eps> I have linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17 installed
[07:16] <nolimitsoya> dabaR_, im not sure what you are getting at, but my point was that -generic has obsoleted all other kernels
[07:16] <_Rebecca> richee, it worked in Ubuntu fine, then I did a software update yesterday and it stopped working
[07:16] <jenniferj> que tal richee
[07:16] <dabaR_> nolimitsoya: do an aptitude search for headers, and for restricted, and see what the desciption of the package says, it is weird...
[07:16] <richee> _Rebecca: did it work with Xine mplayer?
[07:16] <eps> and I have linux-restricted-modules-common installed as well
[07:17] <eps> what am I missing
[07:17] <nolimitsoya> dabaR_, linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic ?
[07:17] <skyrunner> what to do if the install file is .rdf?
[07:17] <ady> I have installed some Ham Radio progs, but I cannot locate them in the menu, how do I access these programs?
[07:17] <nolimitsoya> dabaR_, whats you point? :)
[07:17] <eltech> should atftpd be set to start as boot or will it start on its own?
[07:17] <jrib> eps: the wiki page claims you should use nvidia-xconfig in edgy
[07:17] <_Rebecca> richee, not sure about Xine, all I have used is Mplayer and Mplayer-plugin for firefox
[07:17] <nolimitsoya> skyrunner, you dont install it. ;)

[07:17] <richee> _Rebecca: oh ! boy !
[07:17] <eltech> or should inetd be set to start? if so i dnt see the file to add to update-rc.d
[07:18] <eps> jrib is 6.10 edgy?
[07:18] <ady> do i need to install it?
[07:18] <SilentDis> ady:  sorry, misunderstood your question.  check their man pages (man <programname>), or just try running the package directly at a prompt.
[07:18] <skyrunner> damm because im trying to install gecko for wine and in #winehq nobody seems to know how
[07:18] <dabaR_> eps: aptitude search linux-restricted-modules-386 show me that line for that package.
[07:18] <nolimitsoya> eps, justtry 'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`' and see what falls out
[07:18] <jrib> eps: yep, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia 'nvidia-xconfig' is the whole command
[07:19] <nolimitsoya> dabaR_, the depends are messed up for all the nvidia packages
[07:19] <nolimitsoya> dabaR_, they all depend on 386, when it should be -generic
[07:19] <drkm> if i'm installing applications which don't come through ADD/REMOVE etc or package manager, how can I keep track of the apps so my system doesn't get messy?
[07:20] <SilentDis> ady:  once you've installed a program in synaptic, it's on your machine and ready to use.  make sure it 'works' (try running it from the console), then you can add it to your menus under gnome/kde :)
[07:20] <eps> linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386 is already the newest version.
[07:20] <skyrunner> eps what u trying to do?
[07:20] <nolimitsoya> eps, then you are running 386 and not generic
[07:20] <eps> skyrunner enable nvidia drivers :|
[07:20] <SilentDis> drkm:  a text document with what you've installed is a good way ;)
[07:21] <skyrunner> uhm
[07:21] <eps> I copied this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[07:21] <nolimitsoya> drkm, you cant. not easily anyways... you can keep track of the files in bin, but thats just messy
[07:21] <skyrunner> eps, computer specs?
[07:21] <peter07> hi, enybody use wifi-radar?

[07:22] <mats> peter07: i use kismet?
[07:22] <drkm> nolimitsoya: have you heard of a program called CheckMake I think it does something like what I want but I'm not too sure
[07:22] <peter07> mats: it has gui and it's simple?

[07:22] <Flare> why do i cannot uninstall GRUB in FC 4 ,help me
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> drkm, theres a thing called checkinstalled, but its dangerous... very much so
[07:23] <peter07> mats: i need to configure connection with AP using wpa
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> *checkinstall
[07:23] <pestilence> can you net-boot the livecd?
[07:23] <jrib> nolimitsoya: dangerous?
[07:23] <skyrunner> D : i hate hangovers
[07:23] <nolimitsoya> !checkinstall | jrib
[07:23] <ubotu> jrib: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall - Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page, and DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[07:24] <jrib> nolimitsoya: so it's not dangerous if you use it correctly?
[07:24] <eps> so removing enable makes it work, I see
[07:24] <eps> thank you all :)

[07:25] <Flare> i had key 'rpm -e grub' say 'exist 255'
[07:25] <eps> skyrunner I'm sorry; I got confused over which version of ubuntu was which one :|
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> jrib, bad luck is bad luck :) skydiving, basejumping or riding niagara in a barrel is not dangerous if all goes well either
[07:25] <eps> I didn't realise edgy was 6.10 so I ran the other command
[07:25] <Flare> why do i cannot uninstall GRUB in FC 4 ,help me
[07:25] <peter07> maybe somebody know how to configure wi-fi connection with wpa using gui ( something like wifi-radar ) ?
[07:25] <skyrunner> so you're running edgy?
[07:25] <eps> I'm running 6.10 :|
[07:26] <eps> if that is edgy then yes
[07:26] <nolimitsoya> jrib, -> "CheckInstall occasionally sets incorrect access permissions for your root directory (/), resulting in the inability to execute most commands or perform most operations on the system." :P
[07:27] <spikeb> apparently my dvd drive needed its region set correctly :)
[07:27] <SilentDis> eps:  did you check out the envy webpage that ubotu sent you yet?  I was having a ton of problems with setting up the nvidia drivers myself, till i found that script.  just run once and it's DONE. :)

[07:29] <eps> hehe
[07:29] <skyrunner> oh lol
[07:29] <CokeNCode> how do i get bitchx to operate in stealth mode, or at very least change the ctcp VERSION response?
[07:29] <skyrunner> then dont do nothin
[07:29] <spikeb> thoggen isn't cooperating with me very well though
[07:29] <eps> if you remove the enable from the sudo nvidia-config line it works :D

[07:30] <amonkey> eps, i'm copying from a windows share, can i use that?
[07:30] <eps> amonkey man scp
[07:31] <eps> you can copy from any location to any location I believe
[07:31] <eps> though usual cp should report errors
[07:31] <eps> all I/O errors are definitely enabled
[07:32] <amonkey>  eps, it's from windows so i worry.
[07:33] <SilentDis> amonkey:  you should be able to check the md5sum for the copied file, as well as the source file...
[07:33] <eps> amonkey I personally would compress it and then decompress
[07:33] <eps> that way it will be checked; and once it is verified delete the original source (if you are that paranoid)

[08:06] <lassegs> ive tried installing the sky98lin driver but nothing happens
[08:06] <SilentDis> Ulixes:  should be able to just head to http://www.ubuntu.com/ and click the 'download' link :)
[08:07] <jrib> Ulixes: http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/releases/6.10/release/

[08:08] <Ulixes> the second link works
[08:08] <ailean> how do i set the default boot for grub?
[08:08] <Ulixes> in the website i couldn't find dvd
[08:08] <jrib> ailean: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst with your favorite text editor
[08:09] <lassegs> edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:09] <ailean> jrib, just put the one i want at the top or what?
[08:09] <lassegs> dang to late

[08:09] <drkwol1> hi how to install ubuntu (edgy) without X (i've the cd but my graphic card is not supported )?
[08:09] <lassegs> wow thaks
[08:09] <pestilence> drkwol1: use the alternate install cd
[08:09] <jrib> !alternate | drkwol1
[08:09] <ubotu> drkwol1: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[08:09] <SilentDis> drkwol1:  you're looking for the server install cd :)
[08:10] <drkwol1> pestilence: no other way ?
[08:10] <lassegs> drwoll: :D
[08:10] <FernandoCordes> !grub | ailean
[08:10] <ubotu> ailean: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[08:10] <SilentDis> or alternate, yeah, that too :)
[08:10] <pestilence> drkwol1: not that i know of
[08:10] <Capslock118> Does anyone know how I can mount my NVIDIA RAID? Ive searched many forums but everything points to how to install edgy on a raid
[08:11] <pestilence> Capslock118: is it a hardware raid?
[08:11] <Capslock118> well....I think it would be considered a fakeRaid
[08:11] <pestilence> Capslock118: what's wrong with "mount /dev/sd{whatever} mountpoint"?
[08:11] <SilentDis> byeeeeeee all :)
[08:11] <Capslock118> nforce chipset
[08:11] <drkwol1> pestilence: on debian there's baseconfig or somthing like that, i just want to install the base system
[08:11] <Capslock118> it sees the sda and sdb but it doesnt see both drives togetehr
[08:12] <pestilence> drkwol1: right, i just don't think that's possible off of the livecd
[08:12] <pestilence> drkwol1: you have to use the "alternate" cd or the "server" cd
[08:12] <pestilence> they have the old installer on them

[08:23] <gostview> hi all, is there a program like frontpage for linux?
[08:24] <Infeliz> haha
[08:24] <dogsthat> http://nvu.com/index.php
[08:24] <lassegs> gostview, maybe screem or quanta +
[08:24] <dabju> lassegs, it gives me lots of options. And I can change them. But it dosent use my projector..
[08:24] <Infeliz> why to use frontpage
[08:24] <ubox> hey all
[08:24] <Capslock118> lassegs: well it still said I had a syntax error, but I just changed the file name to take care of it
[08:24] <dogsthat> that's a frontpage type program but way better
[08:24] <lassegs> Capslock118, nice
[08:24] <gostview> lassegs> is those a kind of wysywyg?
[08:25] <lassegs> gostview, kinda... google them
[08:25] <Capslock118> now my biggest problem is trying to get my RAID to be seen
[08:25] <phaedra> gostview, nvu or bluefish is your best bet...
[08:25] <lassegs> dabju, then man aticonfig
[08:25] <Capslock118> ive read that dmraid is broken aside from the latest version, which i believe i have
[08:25] <dabju> lassegs, I dont know if aticonfig is the problem..
[08:26] <dabju> lassegs, how do I know if linux finds my dvi output?
[08:26] <Capslock118> and it can see the raid, but I dont know where to go from there to mount (i have a windows partition with the rest unformatted, I want to be able to utilize this drive
[08:26] <lassegs> dabju, lspci ?
[08:26] <gostview> phaedra> I got Nvu, but it too difficult 'cos need html knowledge
[08:26] <h08817> lassegs, where can i find that vlc? i don't see it in the repos or on sourceforge
[08:27] <phaedra> gostview,  Then try bluefish.
[08:27] <lassegs> gostview, use 15 minuits to learn html, its really easy
[08:27] <dabju> lassegs, right. thanks. 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 71c5
[08:27] <gostview> ok, tnx all

[08:28] <dogsthat> Hi, having problems installing Ubuntu 6.10 on a Pentium 866MHz PC. After choosing _any_ of the options (standard, safe graphics, VGA etc.) the install progresses until the screen goes blank - *out of range*. It has a Matrox G200 graphics card and I've tried out *3* different monitors (19" LG Flatron, 17" Dell, 17" Mitsubishi). Any ideas? tia
[08:28] <gostview> lassegs> yet I tried to study html, but better a wysiwyg method, more simple, more immediatly
[08:28] <ubox> i am configuring postfix on my machine for LAN..do i have to add lines in /etc/postfix/main.cf for pop and smtp, if yes whr and wht should i add??
[08:28] <h08817> lassegs, found it elsewhere but thanks
[08:28] <phaedra> dogsthat,  Is this the graphical install?  Try the alternate cd install.
[08:29] <ianp> dogsthat: sounds like the settings (ranges?) for the monitor are wrong ...
[08:29] <nweaver916> Anyone here use the Deskbar applet?
[08:29] <tx22> Guys u gotta give me some insight. I've found a macbook (13") core 2 duo, 1.83ghz boxed for 489... Is this too cheap?.. is there a catch?.. Are macbooks good at running ubuntu??.. need to know this soon cos' the sale is going to end

[08:39] <tx22> I've found a macbook (13") core 2 duo, 1.83ghz boxed for 489... Is this too cheap?.. is there a catch?
[08:39] <renihs> the catch is its the smalles core2 duo
[08:39] <renihs> with only very small L2
[08:39] <Smotang> ubotu smotang !packages
[08:39] <renihs> apt-cache,...lol
[08:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smotang !packages - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:39] <Capslock118> would I be better trashing windows to mount this Raid device then reinstall it once I have everything taken care of?
[08:39] <Smotang> >.<
[08:40] <renihs> why does apt-cache search give back seamingly random results?
[08:40] <Smotang> ubotu smotang| !packages
[08:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smotang - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:40] <renihs> stuff that has nothing todo with my search word

[08:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smotang : !packages - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:40] <Lynoure> renihs: (maybe in the pastebin, if it is long)
[08:40] <renihs> i type apt-cache search dmraid and i get just i dont know
[08:41] <renihs> apt-cache search kernel and i get stuff back which has nothing todo with kernel
[08:41] <python> hi guys
[08:41] <renihs> etc ec
[08:41] <renihs> but maybe i cant use it correctly
[08:41] <dogsthat> phaedra, thanks. very weird. if you click on the choosing 6.06 link on safari or camino on a mac, it opens up the 6.10 list of localities, and gets rid of the 6.06 list. Finally got link to here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/dapper/
[08:41] <renihs> doesnt matter
[08:41] <python> I just installed vncserver and im setting up gnome on my server right now
[08:41] <renihs> we are running away from ubuntu asap :)
[08:41] <python> with apt-get
[08:41] <Lynoure> renihs: search includes stuff in the description too.
[08:41] <Help> hi can some one help during install im getting a partition problem
[08:41] <renihs> Lynoure, howto turn that behaviour off?
[08:41] <|markie|> anybody knows how these 3d desktop workplace switchers works ?
[08:42] <renihs> i want todo a packet-search not a description search
[08:42] <renihs> if i want todo a description search i should be able to but ...
[08:42] <Lynoure> renihs: do apt-cache show  if you just want to see the package by exact name
[08:42] <renihs> all packages?
[08:43] <renihs> i just want to see all packages which have kernel-source in the description for example
[08:43] <renihs> in the name
[08:43] <renihs> package name i mean
[08:43] <renihs> but never mind
[08:43] <Lynoure> renihs: or  apt-cache search foobar | grep foobar   if things with that in the name or short description
[08:43] <renihs> ya, thats what i do but thats filthy
[08:43] <Lynoure> filthy?
[08:43] <renihs> anyhow, since ubuntu doesnt run on plattforms it is certified for we cannot use it
[08:44] <renihs> which is good because then my distro is next in row :)
[08:44] <Lynoure> renihs: what is your distro?
[08:44] <renihs> based on gentoo
[08:44] <renihs> narf livesystems are desktop

[09:06] <pike_> Help: not sure what the problem is but you could try buring the gparted livecd to partition.  often it works when ubuntu has a problem
[09:06] <Ulixes> hi
[09:06] <Help> okay thanks oike
[09:06] <Help> pike
[09:06] <Ulixes> can you explain me what are the differences btwn dvd alternate and desktop cd????
[09:06] <mdke> what is the simplest application for me to use to directly copy an audio cd? I tried banshee but it failed rubbishly
[09:07] <carutsu> hello
[09:07] <wbadger> can someone please tell me how to keep /etc/resolv.conf from changing?
[09:07] <Ulixes> pls
[09:07] <carutsu> I recently instaled ubuntu and i installed kde, now i want to totally remove ubuntu
[09:08] <||arifaX> wbadger: it is good when it changes dynamically upon changing the locations ( use package resolvconf for that) and I like it. what to you mean exactly?
[09:08] <randomc0de> wbadger: it's set whenever your network connection gets new DNS servers
[09:08] <carutsu> but when i tried to do so it uninstalled everything even synaptics and the icons and i couldn't fix it
[09:08] <carutsu> so i reinstaled ubuntu
[09:08] <carutsu> but i stil want kubuntu
[09:09] <canine_kouji> question, I've a new Core2Duo 2.4Ghz
[09:09] <carutsu> currently i'm downloading kubuntu-desktop
[09:09] <carutsu> any ideas?
[09:09] <canine_kouji> core2 is 64bit, I'm suposed to be using the amd64 iso, right? also, I was looking at the 6.06 amd64, does this not have all drivers?
[09:10] <wbadger> ||arifaX, randomc0de, it sets my nameserver to my router's address and though that's usually good my router has a known problem of not resolving DNSs right. So I can change the file to my ISPs DNSs, but every time I reboot the file reverts back to the router's address (10.0.0.138).
[09:10] <pike_> carutsu: you could try uninstalling the libgtk packages that should clear out most gnome stuff i would think
[09:10] <canine_kouji> if I use the livecd of the 6.06, the timing is ALL out of whack and everything acts like it is going 2x faster(audio/video/everything)
[09:10] <carutsu> libgtk? ok
[09:10] <carutsu> i'll try it out
[09:10] <canine_kouji> does 6.10 have all the needed drivers for a 64bit build for a new computer?
[09:10] <pike_> carutsu: trick is finding a very common dependancy and removing it
[09:11] <randomc0de> wbadger: I had that problem earlier this year, you either have to fix your router to stop being a DNS server, or hack it to correct the resolve.conf on startup
[09:11] <canine_kouji> note: I could use the 32 bit build of ubuntu, but I want to use 64
[09:11] <carutsu> but the dependants will be removed too?
[09:11] <randomc0de> there's probably a better way, but hacking it's easier
[09:11] <canine_kouji> the 32bit runs fine, but it is kinda irritating
[09:11] <pike_> carutsu: yeah the package manager will remove anything that could no longer run
[09:11] <mborg> root@mborg-laptop:~# sudo cp -t libflashplayer.so /usr/share/mozilla/plugins
[09:11] <mborg> cp: accessing `libflashplayer.so': No such file or directory
[09:11] <canine_kouji> mm
[09:11] <canine_kouji> thinking about it
[09:12] <carutsu> ok i'll let you know
[09:12] <mborg> but libflasplayer.so is in /tmp
[09:12] <wbadger> randomc0de, this router serves 2 other windows machines so I don't want to change it, instead I'd like to change my machine alone, meaning configuring whatever program it is that changes resolv.conf to stop changing it.
[09:12] <canine_kouji> what software is not 64bit?
[09:12] <canine_kouji> as in flash, etc
[09:12] <||arifaX> wbadger: i use resolvconf and guessnet package and a custom /etc/network/interfaces file. eg. when I write a configuration like yours in my interfaces file it will automatically set up my nic and a resolv.conf that represents my settings. maybe you take a look at this packages?
[09:12] <canine_kouji> can wine run right under 64bit right now?
[09:13] <carutsu> partially off-topic: see this linux video you'll just love it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZmJ63sHoKU
[09:13] <canine_kouji> damned nvidia and 64 bit builds > I only wish I could use FreeBSD :/
[09:14] <satiee> Does Ubuntu work with Core 2 Duo processors?
[09:14] <canine_kouji> satiee: same question I have
[09:14] <carutsu> yep, but it may not use full potential
[09:14] <mdke> what is the simplest application for me to use to directly copy an audio cd? I tried banshee but it failed rubbishly
[09:14] <wbadger> ||arifaX, thanks I'll look them up. I have to restart now since I just updated a lot of software (a fresh install of ubuntu)
[09:14] <carutsu> i used sound juicer from GNOME
[09:15] <canine_kouji> satiee: I think the way for getting a good computer setup is by unfortunately using Gentoo or FreeBSD :/
[09:15] <pike_> mdke: not rip just create an iso and burn?
[09:15] <mdke> carutsu: afaics, sound-juicer doesn't copy a cd
[09:15] <mdke> pike_: yes, just copy the cd as it is
[09:15] <freefall> can i ask a off topic question
[09:15] <carutsu> oh sorry i though rip music, lol same word in my language
[09:15] <satiee> canine_kouji, I see :(
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[09:15] <pike_> cat /dev/cdrom > filename.iso   then just burn it
[09:15] <canine_kouji> satiee: both gentoo and freebsd you can rebuild the OS to be optimized for a core2
[09:15] <mdke> freefall: by definition, you can only ask on-topic questions. That's what the topic is for
[09:16] <canine_kouji> satiee: the binary builds of ubuntu or any OS will not be core2 specific
[09:16] <Capslock118> would updating the kernel be a good idea?
[09:16] <canine_kouji> windows is in the same boat
[09:16] <mdke> pike_: alright... I'd hoped there would be something a bit simpler. I'll try that if I have to
[09:16] <freefall> well there isnt really a channel made for routers
[09:16] <satiee> And how does this 'rebuilding' work? Anything possible for newbs like me?
[09:16] <mdke> pike_: ah, right click, copy CD... not sure if it works though
[09:16] <canine_kouji> satiee: it wont. You're stuck with crappy binary builds ;)
[09:16] <mdke> freefall: #ubuntu-offtopic is for anything related to ubuntu
[09:16] <mdke> try that
[09:16] <satiee> great :p
[09:17] <satiee> I'm considering to run Ubuntu as my one and only OS, but problem is that I'm something of a gamer. Do you reckon it's worth the hassle or should I just stick with XP for now?
[09:17] <canine_kouji> I like FreeBSD much more, but.. you know.. desktop working machine and all..
[09:17] <ady> which antivirus software do u use for ubuntu?
[09:17] <canine_kouji> satiee: games suck, stick with XP if you want to game
[09:17] <carutsu> if you are a gamer you shouldn't change
[09:17] <||arifaX> carutsu: nice video
[09:17] <mdke> ady: most people don't use antivirus software

[09:20] <matt____> i don't get it, i want to  uninstall ekiga. when i go to uninstall it, it says there are dependencies, so i go to advanced. when i go about uninstalling it from there, it says gnome desktop will also have to be uninstalled. can i not uninstall ekiga?

[09:20] <prOMiNd> how to remove fluxbox ...
[09:20] <prOMiNd> im use this command and i can't push GNOME ...
[09:20] <prOMiNd> sudo apt-get install fluxbox ...
[09:20] <cmdrwill> regeya, I get the login screen (kubuntu), but when I put in my credentials it goes blank because I typed it right and then you think the splash screen is going to load but it just goes black and comes back to the login screen
[09:21] <prOMiNd> and my Ubuntu load only FLuxbox ...
[09:21] <regeya> cmdrwill: this probably won't help then, but here goes anyway:  http://wiki.kdenews.org/tiki-index.php?page=Troubleshooting+KDE+Problems
[09:21] <matt____> i don't get it, i want to uninstall ekiga. when i go to uninstall it, it says there are dependencies, so i go to advanced. when i go about uninstalling it from there, it says gnome desktop will also have to be uninstalled. can i not uninstall ekiga?
[09:21] <prOMiNd> fluxbox don't have a normal skins and don't have a start menu and etc....
[09:21] <pike_> prOMiNd: you can choose which to load at the login screen click 'sessions' button
[09:22] <regeya> cmdrwill: also, try hitting ctrl-alt-2 (or whatever) to switch to a different virtual console, and try to log in from the console.  if you can, see if you can write to your home dir (try something like "echo 'I like pie' > temp.txt")
[09:22] <matt____> can i uninstall ekiga?
[09:22] <intrepidus> Well here's a random question: why can't I use my keyboard to move left, right, up, and down? O.o
[09:22] <regeya> cmdrwill: I didn't have it happen on dapper, but had it happen on (I think) warty where the permissions were never set correctly on the home dir.
[09:22] <intrepidus> If I type a sentence, I can't hit left and make it go back

[09:36] <mnoir> matt____: gnome desktop is a meta package.  If you uninstall any of it's components, it is not fully installed
[09:36] <computermc> LjL: thanks that worked
[09:37] <mnoir> matt____: if gnome desktop is not fully installed, do not expect the depenency management to work as you expect, in the future

[09:37] <LjL> you mean
[09:37] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop
[09:37] <ubotu> k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.

[10:17] <Flamekebab> thank you
[10:17] <oneseventeen> finalbeta thanks, that's a very interesting post.  My purpose is for installing a VM on a machine that has no CD Rom, but the whole backup concept looks prety cool too.
[10:17] <Slyboots_> I think the problem might be Im using Nvidia stripped RAID on the discs
[10:18] <DARKGuy> How do I know what's my computer's timezone and to change it? (it's 5 hours in the future :/ )
[10:19] <Fleebailey33> i deleted my sources.list for feisty by mistake
[10:19] <reverseblade> DARKGuy, click to your time diplay at top right
[10:19] <Fleebailey33> can some pastebin another
[10:19] <lkusmir> Flamekebab, ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55; ifconfig eth0 up;
[10:19] <reverseblade> Fleebailey33, doh :)
[10:19] <Fleebailey33> yes reverseblade
[10:19] <DARKGuy> reverseblade: that'd work - if I had the full ubuntu, I installed it with the alternate CD and I'm using fluxbox atm (Gnome is slooooooooow) so :/
[10:19] <reverseblade> Fleebailey33, search for the forums, I am sure you will find one
[10:19] <Fleebailey33> probably due to chroot
[10:19] <Fleebailey33> tried
[10:19] <Fleebailey33> send me yours?
[10:19] <Fleebailey33> and ill change edgy to fiesty
[10:20] <DARKGuy> reverseblade: besides when it installed, my timezone wasn't in the list and there was no option to choose another one though
[10:20] <Fleebailey33> you sound like an edgy guy
[10:20] <Fleebailey33> heh
[10:20] <reverseblade> Fleebailey33, too lazy for that
[10:20] <Kanafani> Hello. My friend got a problem with bug-buddy. The app restart itself over and over, when he closes it. Solution?
[10:20] <Fleebailey33> i got a sister
[10:20] <Fleebailey33> hot sister!
[10:20] <reverseblade> lol
[10:20] <zor0> I have a corrupted hard disk, where should I start trying to recover the data?
[10:20] <reverseblade> but I am prolly 10 000 miles away from you , so that doesn't count
[10:20] <Fleebailey33> come on reverse blade
[10:20] <startswithz_> how do I log into gnome as the root user?
[10:20] <raavi> zor0 what kind of corruption is that
[10:21] <startswithz_> or get root access in gnome
[10:21] <reverseblade> Fleebailey33, really just search the forums, and still can't find, I'll help
[10:21] <Fleebailey33> humbug
[10:21] <raavi> startswithz_ sudo su
[10:21] <reverseblade> Fleebailey33, my sources list is for Turkey
[10:21] <Fleebailey33> anyone else
[10:21] <zor0> raavi: dead hard disk in a laptop, still sort of works with errors, I just want to read as much stuff off as I can
[10:21] <Fleebailey33> epsecially kubuntu
[10:21] <reverseblade> startswithz_, console would be enough ?
[10:21] <Fleebailey33> want to send there edgy or feisty sources.list to me!!
[10:21] <Dial_tone> startswithz_, did you set a root pw?
[10:22] <startswithz_> yeah
[10:22] <raavi> zor0: try to use live CD and see whether you can mount that or not...
[10:22] <zor0> raavi: I'm booting to a gentoo live disk, but I get an io error trying to mount the drive
[10:22] <reverseblade> startswithz_, try sudo su
[10:22] <DARKGuy> Does anybody know how to change the computer's timezone inside the command line?
[10:22] <startswithz_> reverseblade didn't do anything
[10:22] <raavi> zor0: can you able to understand the dmesg
[10:22] <raavi> or
[10:22] <startswithz_> well, actually in the console I am now root
[10:22] <startswithz_> but not in gnome
[10:22] <reverseblade> startswithz_, that logs you as a root into the console
[10:23] <zor0> raavi: something about i/o error sector 2
[10:23] <reverseblade> starkruz1, why exactly do you need root access for gnome ?
[10:23] <startswithz_> I need to be in root in gnome
[10:23] <reverseblade> startswithz_, why ?
[10:23] <startswithz_> or I need to know how to use chmod to change the permissions on a folder
[10:23] <reverseblade> startswithz_, oh no need to, try gksudo nautilus
[10:23] <raavi> zor0: may be you have tell more about IO error...
[10:23] <lkusmir> startswithz_, man chmod
[10:24] <reverseblade> lkusmir, he wants to do it via nautilus
[10:24] <zor0> raavi: sorry I'm a bit slow, booting into the live cd now
[10:24] <startswithz_> I don't really care
[10:24] <startswithz_> I just want to do it
[10:24] <reverseblade> startswithz_, just type gksudo nautilus and you will be fine (and could change any permission)
[10:24] <zor0> raavi: its an ibook g4 with hfs+ on the disk
[10:24] <jrib> startswithz_: what folder?
[10:25] <startswithz_> its a folder in /
[10:25] <lkusmir> gksu nautilus then
[10:25] <startswithz_> I want to alter the permissions so that an smb user can alter it
[10:25] <jrib> startswithz_: chmod things outside your home is a way to end up reinstalling
[10:25] <raavi> zor0: can live CD able to detect the file system correctly or...
[10:25] <startswithz_> it's a folder i've added
[10:25] <jrib> startswithz_: ok
[10:26] <Slyboots_> So.. anyone any ides why the installer thinks my hard-drives are all blank?
[10:26] <raavi> zor0: I can suggest to use knopix live...
[10:26] <ValMarko> what is samba ?
[10:26] <zor0> raavi: I used to be able to mount the disk by specifying the fs, now it won't mount at all
[10:26] <reverseblade> Slyboots_, what are you up to ?
[10:26] <jrib> !samba | ValMarko
[10:26] <ubotu> ValMarko: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[10:26] <fenrig> can anyone
[10:26] <reverseblade> !samba ValMarko
[10:26] <Slyboots_> The Partitioning section of the Installer
[10:26] <ubotu> samba: a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix. In component main, is optional. Version 3.0.22-1ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 2836 kB, installed size 7200 kB
[10:26] <zor0> raavi: knoppix dosn't work in ppc, I'm using a gentoo live disk
[10:26] <fenrig> help me with cracking turboprint
[10:26] <Slyboots_> When I set it to manualy partition the drive, it shows both discs as unpartitioned
[10:26] <reverseblade> fenrig, lol
[10:26] <jrib> fenrig: no, buy it if you want to use it
[10:26] <fenrig> yeah i know
[10:27] <wy> Is anyone using ATI drivers with xorg? I've got problems with it on my Thinkpad T60. It hangs the computer sometimes when I'm using VMware
[10:27] <raavi> zor0: may be it has further corruption....
[10:27] <fenrig> but just help
[10:27] <fenrig> im almost there
[10:27] <Infeliz> dont use wmware
[10:27] <reverseblade> wy, I was using in my old comp, no problems
[10:27] <reverseblade> no
[10:27] <reverseblade> use it
[10:27] <zor0> raavi: thats what I was afraid of, I'd like to take an image of the drive
[10:27] <reverseblade> vmware rocks
[10:27] <h08817> narvik86, yeah it opens the file i see it buffering but i dont see any video just sound
[10:27] <raavi> zor0: on the disk. I like to know the nature of the corruption.
[10:27] <fenrig> im trying to crack it for 2 hours
[10:27] <fenrig> so if u could just help
[10:27] <zor0> raavi: no idea, Ill get you the error though
[10:27] <reverseblade> fenrig, if you give me 50 bucks I will do it for you
[10:28] <sonicGB> fenrig: there's a simple method that should only take you another sixteen minutes
[10:28] <sonicGB> fenrig: first, spend fifteen minutes begging your mum for a loan of her credit card, then
[10:28] <sonicGB> fenrig: buy the software online!
[10:28] <reverseblade> hehe
[10:28] <Music_Shuffle> fenrig, The amount of help you will receive in this channel is proportional directly to the legality of your endeavor.
[10:28] <fenrig> ah so
[10:28] <fenrig> i dont care
[10:29] <fenrig> i cracked a lot
[10:29] <reverseblade> fenrig, I'll do for 50 bucks
[10:29] <fenrig> but turboprint
[10:29] <graft> hey, i'm trying to configure apt-build and wondering what my architecture should be if i have a celeron M?
[10:29] <fenrig> is really a thing apart
[10:29] <startswithz_> ok so chmod 666 /directory name would give everyone permission to read and write correct?
[10:29] <raavi> zor0: Once, you are aware of error message, you can try mailing to Linux Kernel Mailing List, I hope there are many who has good knowledge in ppc
[10:29] <reverseblade> starkruz1, yes but not execute
[10:29] <tuna-fish-> is there a case insensitive method of comparing files in dirs?
[10:29] <graft> startswithz_: directories need to be executable
[10:29] <Slyboots_> So.. No ideas, anyone at all?
[10:29] <reverseblade> startswithz_, not executing entering dirs
[10:30] <pike_> tuna-fish-: diff -ir i think
[10:30] <h08817> nothing works for me to play wmv files i've installed win32 codecs and installed vlc and i installed the mediaplayerconnectivity for firefox.. Any ideas?
[10:30] <reverseblade> startswithz_, 777 for everyone
[10:30] <tuna-fish-> thanks
[10:30] <startswithz_> reverseblade right.  Is that going to be important for transfering files?
[10:30] <phiqtion> how can i check if my swap partition is mounted correctly?
[10:30] <DARKGuy> Does anybody know how to change the computer's timezone inside the command line?
[10:30] <startswithz_> ok
[10:30] <fenrig> i hate that turboprint isnt opensource
[10:30] <reverseblade> startswithz_, via samba ?
[10:30] <zor0> raavi: what I was hoping for was the names of some tools to start researching, is dd good for making a drive image?
[10:30] <graft> anyone? apt-build, what's the correct architecture for a celeron m?
[10:30] <startswithz_> ok so I need to do it 777?
[10:30] <Music_Shuffle> fenrig, its not going to get you any help in HERE ;P
[10:31] <sonicGB> "hate" is such an ugly word fenrig
[10:31] <blue-frog> DARKGuy: tzconfig
[10:31] <phiqtion> how can i check if my swap partition is mounted correctly?
[10:31] <reverseblade> startswithz_, if you want to give full permissions to everyone yes, but it is a bit insecure
[10:31] <raavi> zor0: I never had any experience on recovery or so...I can't suggest anything to you.
[10:31] <reverseblade> phiqtion, man swapon
[10:31] <startswithz_> ok so what permissions would I need to allow a computer on my network to pass files to the folder?
[10:31] <DARKGuy> blue-frog: thanks a lot :D
[10:31] <lkusmir> phiqtion, swapon -s
[10:32] <reverseblade> phiqtion, top
[10:32] <Intangir> are some of the ubuntu servers down right now? when i try to upgrade to edgy it gives me an error about alot of freecontrib repos being down
[10:32] <jrib> startswithz_: why not just try 666, and if it deosn't work then use 777
[10:32] <phiqtion> thank you
[10:32] <frying_fish> graft: i386?
[10:32] <usr_rob_> defauld keyring keeps asking for password, i did save it, but it's keep asking everytime i login, suggestions ?
[10:32] <reverseblade> startswithz_, what is the method for passing ? samba ?
[10:32] <ValMarko> How do I change the look of the toolsbars ?
[10:32] <startswithz_> reverseblade yeah
[10:32] <zor0> dang it, there isn't enough nerdiness on irc to fix this?
=== _DreamThief is now known as DreamThief
[10:32] <graft> frying_fish: err, wants pentium4, etc.
[10:32] <mc44> Intangir: freecontrib repos are not official ubuntu repos
[10:32] <ValMarko> toolbars
[10:32] <reverseblade> startswithz_, have you configured samba itself ?
[10:32] <Intangir> why is the upgrade process relying on them?
[10:32] <startswithz_> I don't know
[10:32] <jrib> Intangir: because they are in your /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:33] <startswithz_> I think I have
[10:33] <mc44> Intangir: because you out them in your sources.list
[10:33] <reverseblade> ValMarko, System > preferences > themes may be
[10:33] <Intangir> k ill check and remove them
[10:33] <reverseblade> startswithz_, local permissions will be AND'ed with samba permissions
[10:33] <graft> startswithz_: you cannot access a directory unless it has +x permission, so it MUST be 777 not 666
[10:33] <Intangir> oh ya there they are for w32codecs ;)
[10:34] <startswithz_> thank you graft
[10:34] <ValMarko> reverseblade, tanks. it really changes the of the desktop but the toolbars remain unchanged
[10:34] <reverseblade> startswithz_, that depends on your users, if they have samba passwords or not, if you have configured them as guests
[10:34] <startswithz_> ok
[10:34] <reverseblade> ValMarko, right click to toolbar properties
[10:34] <phiqtion> After installing Ubuntu on the HD, Grub won't boot winxp and i believe error says: "filesystem error" or something similiar. I believe this is a Grub error or maybe an HD error? should i change anything in the BIOS?
[10:34] <startswithz_> how do I configure the knoppix user to get on?
[10:34] <ValMarko> tanks :)
[10:34] <startswithz_> I have a samba remote user account set up
[10:34] <reverseblade> startswithz_, configure what ?
[10:35] <startswithz_> reverseblade I do not know anymore
[10:35] <linux_kid> phiqtion: what partition manager did you use?
[10:35] <startswithz_> I just want to move files from one computer to another
[10:35] <phiqtion> linux_kid: livecd partition manager which comes in the install process
[10:35] <Intangir> well im upgrading to edgy
[10:35] <Intangir> prey for intangir ;)
[10:36] <reverseblade> startswithz_, if you want to use samba, normally you create a samba user , set that user's unix permissions , set that users samba permissions and you are good to go
=== mcmahonm[A]  is now known as mcmahonm
[10:36] <Intangir> its downloading 870 megs
[10:36] <graft> startswithz_: what's wrong with scp?
[10:36] <linux_kid> phiqtion: well, im not sure if it is nondestructive....  it may have not moved your files so all of the existing files are not overwritten... :(
[10:36] <startswithz_> why is this so complicated
[10:37] <reverseblade> startswithz_, to access to the server from client, you need to use a samba client, your options are, smbclient command from console, smb://server from nautilus or //server from internet explorer , for more info consult #samba
[10:37] <drcode> I install p7zip , but I can;t find 7za or 7z
[10:37] <Music_Shuffle> startswithz_, both Linux? Or one windows?
[10:37] <drcode> any idea?
[10:37] <linux_kid> !! is gparted non-destructive?
[10:37] <sonicGB> startswithz_: do you mind re-stating the problem please... I missed the beginning of the conversation
[10:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is gparted non-destructive? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:37] <startswithz_> music_shuffle both linux
[10:37] <Music_Shuffle> startswithz_, use NFS.
[10:37] <graft> or scp...
[10:37] <startswithz_> sonicgb I think I missed the beginning too
[10:37] <reverseblade> startswithz_, that's the philosophy of linux, it is first difficult, when you learn it , you start to enjoy the power you have.
[10:37] <phiqtion> linux_kid: i just want to boot winxp from GRUB, i already know the files weren't overwritten
[10:37] <Music_Shuffle> startswithz_, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=249889
[10:38] <jrib> drcode: dpkg -L p7zip | grep bin
[10:38] <startswithz_> ok so what program should I use? bear in mind one of the computers is running knoppix
[10:38] <graft> yo, transferring files is much EASIER on linux than it is on windoze... is there even any support for remote file access at all unless you're on the same subnet?
[10:38] <linux_kid> phiqton: ok, did you run disc check before installing ubuntu?
[10:38] <Music_Shuffle> NFS is all Unix systems.
[10:38] <graft> startswithz_: man scp!
[10:38] <drcode> jrib, I have install p7zip
[10:38] <startswithz_> !scp
[10:38] <ubotu> SCP is a secure way of copying files across networks using !SSH. Usage: scp filename user@host:filename - WinSCP is a client for Windows, available at http://winscp.net/
[10:38] <sonicGB> startswithz_: what do you need to achieve? a one-off copy, or something regular, or ....?
[10:38] <Rob423> I need some help lol
[10:38] <reverseblade> startswithz_, you could use a simple method, right click to a folder and share it
[10:38] <HDS43> !ati
[10:38] <jrib> drcode: yes, that command will tell you what commands you have
[10:38] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:38] <drcode> jrib, In what dir it put the 7za?
[10:39] <Music_Shuffle> !ask | Rob423
[10:39] <ubotu> Rob423: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:39] <startswithz_> sonicgb I need a one time copy
[10:39] <phiqtion> linux_kid: no. because i used an official CD
[10:39] <jrib> drcode: it seems to install 7zr and p7zip as commands you can run
[10:39] <reverseblade> startswithz_, what I have told you was a full samba server to be used as a file server
[10:39] <startswithz_> reverseblade that's what I was originally trying to do
[10:39] <sonicGB> from a box running knoppix to a box running some other linux?
[10:39] <reverseblade> startswithz_, and does it work for you ?
[10:39] <startswithz_> how do I just share the folder?
[10:39] <reverseblade> startswithz_, right click to that folder and click share folder
[10:39] <sonicGB> startswithz_: is sshd running on the destination box?
[10:39] <drcode> jrib, so in xarchive I need to change to 7zr?
[10:40] <startswithz_> I can see the folder on the other computer
[10:40] <startswithz_> well not the one I made in my home folder
[10:40] <jrib> drcode: I don't know what xarchive is
[10:40] <linux_kid> phiqton: no, i mean did you run a windows scan disk or NT's discchk?
[10:40] <startswithz_> so basically I have become very confused
[10:40] <reverseblade> startswithz_, are you following me ?
[10:40] <sege> I'm having trouble with gnome-terminal when I'm running Beryl. My tabs have the same color, active and inactive. Same thing with drag&drop in Evolution, the target marker have the same color as evolution-background or no color. Good solution anyone? =)
[10:40] <ToHellWithGA> how do you scp directories?
[10:40] <sonicGB> startswithz_: if it's a one-off, get a shell on the source box and type something to the effect of "rsync --archive --stats --progress /dir/where/files/are username@destination.box:/dir/where/I/want/the/files"
[10:40] <reverseblade> startswithz_, right click to the folder and click share folder than
[10:40] <Rob423> I am running VM-ware with Ubuntu.  I'm trying to install VM-tools.  now i can't install anything because i just realized im not in "super user" mode.   I only made 1 account so far .. how can I grant Super user access to this 1 account i've made?
[10:40] <startswithz_> reverseblade I did that
[10:40] <ToHellWithGA> i can handle files but directories don't go
[10:41] <usr_rob_> Why do I receive multiple prompts to login to my keyring?
[10:41] <usr_rob_> This is a known issue with 0.6.2, the problem is resolved in 0.6.3.
[10:41] <startswithz_> wait on which computer?
[10:41] <startswithz_> I'm gonna just go try to figure it out myself
[10:41] <sonicGB> on the source computer startswithz_
[10:41] <fuffe> hey.. I get this error when transfer a zip file with nautilus
[10:41] <raavi> rob423: try sudo su
[10:41] <fuffe> BAD FILE HANDLE
[10:41] <nuked_omen> good luck
[10:41] <sonicGB> startswithz_: pm me, I'll talk you through it.
[10:41] <Rob423> just type that into the terminal?
[10:41] <reverseblade> fuffe, prolly broken archive
[10:41] <wy> Is there a way to remove grub from the disk from Windows XP. I've tried many ways but none works
[10:41] <usr_rob_> Apparently not. I use 0.6.3
[10:41] <fuffe> to an ftp server
[10:41] <linux_kid> Rob423 do "sudo" or "gksudo" work
[10:41] <raavi> yeap
[10:41] <jrib> ToHellWithGA: -r
[10:41] <fuffe> I make a new archive.. same shit
[10:41] <reverseblade> wy, what ?
[10:42] <PriceChild> !language | fuffe
[10:42] <ubotu> fuffe: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[10:42] <Rob423> k i typed that and i got some stuff pop up
[10:42] <||arifaX> wy: shouldn't it work to boot recovery console from xp cd and type "fixboot" and "fixmbr" ?
[10:42] <reverseblade> fuffe, search it in google, really !!
[10:42] <ToHellWithGA> ok
[10:42] <ToHellWithGA> thanks
[10:42] <sonicGB> wy: in dos, "fdisk /MBR", in *nix, "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=1024 count=1"
[10:42] <darrel> sdefbs
[10:42] <reverseblade> fuffe, BAD..whatever
[10:42] <sonicGB> BUT, either of those will bork whatever's on your disk
[10:42] <Rob423> -p prompt... -u username - e file -i  -s
[10:42] <fuffe> reverseblade, I allready did.. find nothing useful
[10:43] <sonicGB> take the DOS option if you need to keep what's on the disk
[10:43] <reverseblade> fuffe, try creating different archives from different files, try to create extract it via command line
[10:43] <sonicGB> well done with all the samba silliness for that startswith guy folks... talk about making him do it the hard way... *sigh*
[10:43] <wy> sonicGB: Thanks! I can't book into dos. So are you sure the second command line is accurate?
[10:44] <sonicGB> wy: give me a minute to double check the second one
[10:44] <sonicGB> I know the bs=1024 is too big
[10:44] <wy> sonicGB: Thanks.
[10:44] <Slyboots_> Well this is just great.. I cant even install Ubuntu, and no-one seems to know why
[10:44] <sonicGB> wy: is there anything on the disk you need to keep, or are you just wiping it out to prepare for a complete re-install?
[10:44] <reverseblade> Slyboots_, what happens ?
[10:44] <wy> sonicGB: I don't want to break the system. That's my wife's computer now
[10:44] <Slyboots_> When I reach the partiion stage, It thinks both discs are blank
[10:44] <reverseblade> Slyboots_, just format your drive and go for it
[10:44] <Slyboots_> So I woudl rather not destroy all my date
[10:44] <Rob423> i typed sudo and just got some options.. i didn't see anything that says grant access or anything
[10:45] <Slyboots_> No I'll not bloody format my drive!
[10:45] <sonicGB> wy: then don't type the dd command line I gave you!
[10:45] <sleepytom> Can somebody tell me how to open a microsoft access .mdb file in Open Office?
[10:45] <reverseblade> Slyboots_, than it is not ubuntu's fault, but you have special requirements
[10:45] <Slyboots_> That it cant read SATA-RAID?
[10:45] <sonicGB> wy: what's on the box now? it's just winders xp and nothing else?
[10:45] <wy> ||arifaX: Is it something like safe mode but only with a console?
[10:45] <adrian> Does anybody know how to access aegis antivirus
[10:45] <Slyboots_> Heck, Even DOS could read the drive correctly
[10:45] <jhaig> I've found the wiki page on CompositeManager, and it warns against using Xgl and AIGLX because they are alpha, but the page is pre-Edgy.  Are these still considered unstable or do people use them now?
[10:45] <reverseblade> Slyboots_, it can read SATA but not sure of the RAID part
[10:46] <jrib> !sudo | Rob423
[10:46] <ubotu> Rob423: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:46] <Slyboots_> I see
=== Griverr is now known as Griver
[10:46] <linux_kid> Slyboots_ : you have to use the alt. cd for RAID partitioning
[10:46] <wy> sonicGB: Just windows XP
[10:46] <reverseblade> jhaig, AIGLX rocks
[10:46] <mjr> jhaig, yes and yes :] 
[10:46] <Slyboots_> Oh goody.. What a waste of a cd..
[10:46] <graft> AIGLX is reasonably stable for me
[10:46] <reverseblade> jhaig, however, there might be some simple glitches that might annoy you
[10:46] <fuffe> reverseblade, ok, it seems to work with other files.. but the folder I want to create a zip archive contains thausands of files
[10:46] <jhaig> Thanks.  I was going to set it up, but I wanted to be sure it isn't going to mess things up.
[10:46] <wy> sonicGB: I wonder if there is a program can do this just inside windows XP.
[10:46] <Slyboots_> But does the Alt-CD just not use the same programs?
[10:46] <Slyboots_> Why would the results be any different
[10:47] <adrian> how do I access Aegis virus scanner
[10:47] <sonicGB> wy: with no access to dos, I think you need to play with the xp recovery console... that's something I really don't know much about....
[10:47] <krystyna> i have warnings when i install one program
[10:47] <graft> easy enough to undo AIGLX, since it just runs within your existing x-server anyway
[10:47] <UbuntuRob> Hey guys anyone care to help me install LIGHTTPD on Ubuntu 6.10? lol
[10:47] <reverseblade> Slyboots_, no, it is esp, prepared for your kind
[10:47] <UbuntuRob> I need elp
[10:47] <jrib> krystyna: what program?  and what are the warnings?
[10:47] <UbuntuRob> help*
[10:47] <wy> sonicGB: Press F8 when it starts?
[10:47] <sonicGB> wy: scratching my head here.... it's a bit over the top, but a re-install of XP, telling it to "repair" would definitely do it.
[10:47] <krystyna> its program wrote by my friend
[10:47] <jhaig> Thanks.  I'll have a go.
[10:47] <adrian> anybody useing aegis
[10:47] <krystyna> so i dont know how install without warnings
[10:48] <sonicGB> wy: yes... but after that, I don't know what to do. Googling for ideas here....

[10:49] <crouic6> ok
[10:49] <reverseblade> UbuntuRob, I think you're new to Rails too. Are you trying to learn Rails ?

[10:50] <sleepytom> help with opening .mdb anybody?
[10:50] <UbuntuRob> Reverse; Basically I  need C+=/PHP5/Mysql/Rails/Perl/CGI all in one.
[10:50] <reverseblade> ubuntero_, you don't need any of those just install the rails package via synaptic and you will be fine
[10:50] <UbuntuRob> I want this Ubuntu to be a development machine
[10:50] <sonicGB> wy: your answer is here (boot into recovery console from install CD, use 'fixmbr' command) http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/483/xp_repair_fix_master_boot_record_recovery_console
[10:50] <UbuntuRob> I want php/mysql, etc.
[10:50] <UbuntuRob> I do know the languages.
[10:51] <UbuntuRob> Just not sure what a good server package would be
[10:51] <sonicGB> sleepytom: opening an mdb on *nix is a bit tricky...
[10:51] <reverseblade> ubuntulog, I see, but will you use rails actually ?
[10:51] <jrib> !lamp | UbuntuRob
[10:51] <ubotu> UbuntuRob: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[10:51] <crouic6> I had no problems with dapper bu under eddgy when I start the pc; the pc is stopped

[10:51] <reverseblade> jrib, he is another samba'er case

[10:51] <fuffe> reverseblade, dunno.. I just transfer with nautilus
[10:51] <crouic6> with ntfs3g
[10:51] <jrib> !fuse | phiqtion
[10:51] <ubotu> phiqtion: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[10:52] <reverseblade> fuffe, nautilus do not have FTP support, you can't use FTP
[10:52] <peter07> ubotu: i've read doc, it doesn't help me
[10:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i've read doc, it doesn't help me - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[10:52] <sonicGB> sleepytom: sorry, wrong url... wait....
[10:52] <reverseblade> phiqtion, I tried ntfs3g, works perfect
[10:52] <linux_kid> phiqtion: Warning! using ntfs3g can crash your ntfs partition
[10:52] <sonicGB> sleepytom: http://dba.openoffice.org/drivers/mdb/
[10:52] <reverseblade> linux_kid, no
[10:52] <krystyna> jrib: on my language dont want help me :/ only joke
[10:52] <peter07> linux_kid: no  broadcom card
[10:53] <reverseblade> phiqtion, it is well tested and stable
[10:53] <fuffe> reverseblade, weird.. I have used it for ftp transfers for a week now.. has worked much better than gftp which crashed too much
[10:53] <sleepytom> thanks, guys
[10:53] <linux_kid> reverseblade... no?
[10:53] <devnull__> hello ... i have read the docs but i am having trouble getting fglrx working correctly and i can't figure out why
[10:53] <devnull__> fglrxinfo keeps coming up as mesa crap
[10:53] <reverseblade> linux_kid, no it is well tested and stable, ntfs3g is rather new, not like the older methods
[10:53] <sonicGB> wy: I don't think so, but not 100% sure... press f8 at boot time and see what options it gives you. I think you need an install cd though
[10:53] <jrib> krystyna: ok, join me in #ubuntu-classroom .  There won't be as much traffic there
[10:53] <davro_> people actually still use ftp
[10:53] <reverseblade> fuffe, oh, are you typing ftp://
[10:53] <sleepytom> Cool, thanks Sonic GB
[10:54] <devnull__> davro .. you dont ?
[10:54] <linux_kid> reverseblade cool, thanx
[10:54] <reverseblade> fuffe, sorry it supports ftp, I got it wrong
[10:54] <sonicGB> u welcome sleepytom. good luck
[10:54] <fenrig> can anyone here
[10:54] <UbuntuRob> Crap I need to learn this... :x
[10:54] <devnull__> is there a channel for fglrx issues ?
[10:54] <reverseblade> fuffe, try ftp'ing via different client
[10:54] <fenrig> make printer driver
[10:54] <fuffe> reverseblade, no problem, mate
[10:54] <fenrig> ?
[10:54] <phiqtion> how can i transfer a .rar file to NTFS using fuse?
[10:54] <reverseblade> fenrig, what ?
[10:54] <devnull__> since ubuntu wiki and docs aren't helping at all ?
[10:54] <fenrig> make a printer driver for linux
[10:54] <davro_> no,username password are an issue.
[10:55] <sonicGB> fenrig: yes, I can make printer drivers. I'll give you exactly what you want for USD$50.00....
[10:55] <fuffe> reverseblade, the weird thing is.. the files get uploaded.. but I get that error anyway
[10:55] <fenrig> nah
[10:55] <reverseblade> phiqtion, just create and mount your :NTFS partion and you can use it as if it is a local directory no difference
[10:55] <sonicGB> fenrig: or you could buy turboprint for USD$39
[10:55] <reverseblade> fuffe, try a different client, use console ftp
[10:55] <linux_kid> anyone know if lexmark has linux printer drivers?
[10:55] <phiqtion> reverseblade: it's automatically mounted but i can't seem to write on it with nautilus
[10:55] <mnoir> reverseblade: nautilus doc says it does suppotrt ftp
[10:55] <fenrig> damn
[10:55] <mnoir> support even
[10:55] <fenrig> i really need some drivers
[10:55] <reverseblade> phiqtion, have you used ntfs3g ?
[10:55] <fenrig> does anyone knows
[10:55] <reverseblade> mnoir, oh ok
[10:56] <fenrig> some channel, or sombody
[10:56] <phiqtion> reverseblade: no, should i get it?
[10:56] <davro_> refuse to use ftp unless it is sftp at the very least.
[10:56] <reverseblade> fuffe, just try a different client
[10:56] <sonicGB> fenrig: you really need to buy the drivers you need.
[10:56] <reverseblade> phiqtion, if you want to write to your ntfs partition, yes it is a must
[10:56] <phiqtion> reverseblade: its not available in universe or multiverse it seems
[10:56] <UltimateMacUser1> hi hi
[10:56] <fenrig> *grum*
[10:56] <reverseblade> linux_kid, AFAIK, the support is poor
[10:56] <skianto> hello everybody
[10:57] <reverseblade> !ntfs3g | phiqtion
[10:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ntfs3g - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:57] <sonicGB> linux_kid: I wouldn't touch a lexmark printer with a ten foot pole myself (so I have no direct experience) but googling for "lexmark linux drivers" turns up a lot of promising looking hits
[10:57] <reverseblade> oh
[10:57] <reverseblade> phiqtion, just google it
[10:57] <linux_kid> ok
[10:57] <cassio> hello everybody!
[10:57] <fenrig> sometimes i hate the canon support
[10:57] <reverseblade> linux_kid, your last resort would be installing windows xp via vmware and use your printer from there
[10:57] <phiqtion> reverseblade: do you know about grub? after installing ubuntu, i cant access my xp partition even though it's listed on the grub list
[10:57] <cassio> i'm runnig kutuntu (dapper drake) in a compal notebook
[10:57] <fenrig> does anyone knows
[10:58] <cassio> it comes with a webcam
[10:58] <fenrig> how i can install the cvs version of gutenprint?
[10:58] <cassio> but i just can't make it work...
[10:58] <cassio> how could i?
[10:58] <reverseblade> phiqtion, I am not very experienced, but I am sure there is a fix for this
[10:58] <phiqtion> reverseblade: im thinking DMA?
[10:58] <reverseblade> phiqtion, what do you mean
[10:58] <nweaver916> anyone here ever try to generate a key in puttygen and then import it using ssh-add? Mine rejects the password :(
[10:59] <reverseblade> cassio, may be you can't for webcams no guarantees
[10:59] <sonicGB> phiqtion: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009
[10:59] <skianto> any x86_64 experts online?
[10:59] <reverseblade> skianto, I am a lead RnD developer in AMD corp
[10:59] <sonicGB> phiqtion: http://everythingelse.wordpress.com/2006/07/19/89/
[10:59] <phiqtion> reverseblade: back then in ubuntu 5.10, grub wouldn't load xp and i changed LBA settings on my HD sorry, not DMA and it seemed to boot
[11:00] <phiqtion> sonicGB: thanks bro
[11:00] <reverseblade> phiqtion, dunno
[11:00] <wy> sonicGB: I get into the command from the install CD. Is fixmbr and fixboot the same?
[11:00] <skianto> I have a problem with my  turion x2  based laptop
[11:00] <davro_> cassio have you asked the manufacture of these compal notebooks for os drivers, never heard of this manufacture before.
[11:00] <reverseblade> skianto, pavilion ?
[11:00] <fenrig> does anyone knows how to install the cvs of gutenprint
[11:00] <skianto> yes :)
[11:01] <phiqtion> how do i know what version of ubuntu im running? DAPPER? EDGY?
[11:01] <reverseblade> skianto, dv ?
[11:01] <reverseblade> phiqtion, System , about
[11:01] <skianto> it's an european model
[11:01] <reverseblade> skianto, dv6000 ?
[11:01] <sonicGB> wy: I don't know dude... I'm really no expert on 'fixing' xp.... I usually just use fdisk/format to fix problems! :-)
[11:01] <reverseblade> anyway what is your problem ?
[11:01] <skianto> v6128EU
[11:01] <pike_> phiqtion: rule of thumb for most distros cat /etc/*release
[11:01] <alaa_> hello
[11:02] <reverseblade> skianto, what is your problem ?
[11:02] <phiqtion> EDGY is newer? i thought dapper would automatically upgrade to EDGY with the updates?
[11:02] <cassio> davro it's from asia i think... they sell "whitebooks", so other companies just put another parts, their name and them sell it
[11:02] <cassio> I bought it here in Brazil
[11:02] <reverseblade> phiqtion, no
[11:02] <wy> sonicGB: fixmbr works. Thank you!
[11:02] <skianto> well, I have some
[11:02] <reverseblade> phiqtion, go for edgy, edgy rocks
[11:02] <KenSentMe> I have a problem with running audacity, it can't use the sounddevices. I have software mixing enabled like in the wiki. Anyone know a solution?
[11:02] <alaa_> i'm having trouble using the ati installer on ubuntu 6.10 for my drivers
[11:02] <davro_> <phiqtion> not sure what the easist way its but cat /etc/apt/sources.list should get you there.
[11:02] <sonicGB> wy: u welcome... glad you're sorted! :-)
[11:02] <reverseblade> skianto, if you want solutions you have to tell
[11:02] <skianto> with the kernel installed by edgy eft...
[11:02] <skianto> powernow is working
[11:03] <alaa_> it gives me this error: Could not open the file /home/alaa/Desktop/ati-dler-8.32.5-x86.x86_64.run.
[11:03] <skianto> but sound support is broken
[11:03] <reverseblade> skianto, look, there is no ACPI support, your wireless wont work
[11:03] <john76> anyone know if thier is a way to lock the cpu to the highest speed in ubuntu
[11:03] <phiqtion> 6.06 LTS is EDGY?
[11:03] <skianto> if I try any other kernel...
[11:03] <reverseblade> reverseblade, sound ?
[11:03] <john76> speedstep annoys me
[11:03] <DARKGuy> phiqtion: nope
[11:03] <skianto> I can use the sound, but I lose powernow
[11:03] <EDinNY> can someone tell me what is wrong with this command? "mount -t smbfs -o user=ed //machine_name/ed/ c5
[11:03] <phiqtion> DARKguy: can i update with apt-get? or should i download a fresh .iso and start from scratch?
[11:03] <alaa_> some1 help me =(
[11:03] <reverseblade> skianto, If you can keep up your system I suggest you Fiesty
[11:03] <john76> In windows I use a program speedstepXP
[11:04] <vanberge> can you change your color depth without having to edit the xorg.conf?
[11:04] <skianto> yes, wireless is another problem
[11:04] <reverseblade> skianto, kernels prior to 2.6.18 have some problems with this lappy
[11:04] <skianto> I tried one of the Fiesty kernel
[11:04] <HuibertGill> john76: I have a shell script to flip from min to max cpu speed
[11:04] <skianto> but none of them supports powernow on my laptop
[11:04] <HuibertGill> john76: and back again
[11:05] <reverseblade> skianto, 3 options, deal with each problem (mostly works), upgrade your kernel to 2.6.19 (dunno), use fiesty (works fine but will break in the future)
[11:05] <DARKGuy> phiqtion: Personally, I'd download the ISO and start from scratch. You can, however, update: Change your /etc/apt/sources.list for the one shown in http://www.ubuntuguide.com adn then in a terminal type "sudo apt-get update" If all goes good, you can upgrade by "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[11:05] <john76> HuibertGill can I see the script
[11:05] <phiqtion> DARKGuy: thanks for the tip
[11:05] <fenrig> !gimpprint
[11:05] <DARKGuy> phiqtion: my bad, in http://www.ubuntuguide.org
[11:05] <skianto> I tried 2.6.19 & 2.6.20
[11:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gimpprint - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:05] <fenrig> !gutenprint
[11:05] <DARKGuy> phiqtion: no problem, good luck ^^
[11:05] <skianto> none of them is working
[11:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gutenprint - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:05] <reverseblade> skianto, I do not know about powernowd problems
[11:05] <HuibertGill> john76: to go for full speed: sudo cpufreq-selector -f 2000000 -g performance
[11:05] <reverseblade> skianto, tried fiesty ?
[11:05] <sonicGB> johnI found a thread that talks about fixing another problem by tweaking /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
[11:06] <HuibertGill> john76: to change the speed back to minimal use "-f 1"
[11:06] <sonicGB> john76: I wonder if you could solve your problem by setting min and max to the same number?
[11:06] <skianto> not the whole distribution, just the kernels
[11:06] <john76> how long will it stay at that speed
[11:07] <skianto> I also tried to compile a vanilla kernel myself... same result, powernow is unsupported
[11:07] <reverseblade> skianto, try it with noapic , also 32 bit kernel might result better
[11:07] <john76> where do I set min and max
[11:07] <Alakazamz0r_> skianto, did it taste like vanilla?
[11:07] <john76> I'm willin to try it
[11:07] <reverseblade> skianto, other than that your prolly out of luck
[11:07] <skianto> of course I have to boot every kernel I tried with noapic nolapic
[11:07] <john76> ah
[11:07] <john76> work a try
[11:07] <reverseblade> skianto, otherwise it wont boot ,ehh
[11:07] <HuibertGill> john76: the important parameter is -g performace
[11:08] <skianto> it will hang at some phase during startup
[11:08] <HuibertGill> john76: it is the "speed govenor"
[11:08] <reverseblade> skianto, I see, try fiesty 32 bit, as a last resort
[11:08] <unimatrix9> hi there
[11:08] <john76> well that command seems to set the speed just fine
[11:08] <unimatrix9> just a quick question
[11:08] <skianto>  but... why 2.6.17 works?
[11:09] <unimatrix9> where does the waste go, when i delete thing as root?
[11:09] <Rob423> can someone PM me i need some help installing something on ubuntu
[11:09] <reverseblade> skianto, may be 2.6.19 works too, but custom compiling breaks something
[11:09] <unimatrix9> or , where is the root waste bin?
[11:09] <Slart> Rob423: I don't think you can pm on this server.. just ask the question
[11:09] <reverseblade> Rob423, just ask
[11:09] <graft> Rob423, ask it here...
[11:09] <reverseblade> unimatrix9, doh ?
[11:09] <jhaig> OK, I've configured aiglx a la <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/AIGLXOnEdgy> and I have restarted X.  This may be a silly question but, erm, how do I now use it?
[11:09] <unimatrix9> yeah?
[11:09] <skianto> thinking about a compiler issue?
[11:09] <Rob423> k, well #1.  when i type su- and my pw its saying it's no good
[11:09] <reverseblade> unimatrix9, where is your paste bin ?
[11:09] <graft> jhaig: get beryl?
[11:10] <Rob423> i only made 1 account 1 user name
[11:10] <HuibertGill> unimatrix9: trash is in /root/.Trash
[11:10] <reverseblade> unimatrix9, waste bin

[11:10] <unimatrix9> oh, hehe
[11:10] <python> weee
[11:10] <unimatrix9> :P
[11:10] <jhaig> graft: Is that the window manager?
[11:10] <unimatrix9> silly me
[11:10] <python> im on ubuntu with gnome plus VNC
[11:10] <python> we
[11:10] <Rob423> when i go to my terminal it says rizzle @ rizzle-desktop:~$
[11:10] <graft> jhaig: yah... runs on AIGLX
[11:10] <Rob423> does this mean im logged in as my root?
[11:10] <reverseblade> Rob423, try sudo login -f user
[11:11] <reverseblade> Rob423, as long as you don't have # you are not root,
[11:11] <Rob423> ok i tried that command
[11:11] <john76> ok I set it lets see what happens when I reboot
[11:11] <reverseblade> Rob423, what exactly are you trying to achive ?
[11:11] <Rob423> it said.  user not known to the underlying authetication module
[11:11] <jhaig> graft: OK, thanks.
[11:11] <Rob423> is it possible i never made a root account?
[11:11] <unimatrix9> ok got the trash out of root waste bin, you are the savers of the day
[11:12] <jrib> Rob423: have you read the page on sudo that ubotu told you about?
[11:12] <unimatrix9> thnx
[11:12] <reverseblade> Rob423, there is the root account, it is impossible
[11:12] <unimatrix9> and bye bye
[11:12] <Lunis> would someone be so kind as to recommend me an ide for langs like c#, ruby, perl, python, etc?
[11:12] <Slart> Rob423: Ubuntu doesn't use the root account like that
[11:12] <youser> anyone know where i can ge help for the program nicotine?
[11:12] <Rob423> when i sign into the ubuntu itself in the begining.. is that my main root account?
[11:12] <youser> not the chemical addiction
[11:12] <jrib> Rob423: no
[11:12] <reverseblade> Lunis, for c# mono develop, for ruby , perl python use vim
[11:12] <willskills> Rob423,  no, it's not
[11:12] <Rob423> oh shit, how can i find the username of the root account
[11:12] <Slart> Rob423: nope.. you have your user account. use sudo for everything root-related
[11:12] <jhaig> graft: Is there a reason to use beryl instead of compiz?
[11:13] <reverseblade> Rob423, no root account is a different thing. your created user becomes a  valid sudo'er
[11:13] <Lunis> reverseblade: :) i personally wouldn't call vim an "ide"
[11:13] <PriceChild> !language | Rob423
[11:13] <ubotu> Rob423: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[11:13] <jrib> Rob423: read the page ubotu told you about
[11:13] <reverseblade> Lunis, true but it beats all other
[11:13] <graft> jhaig: more stable, under more active development
[11:13] <Rob423> ah sorry
[11:13] <Slart> Rob423: don't ... if you really really need a root console you can do sudo su
[11:13] <pike_> Lunis: vim takes some adjusting but with :syntax on  is very nice
[11:13] <Lunis> reverseblade: not when i need an ide.
[11:13] <Rob423> what page
[11:13] <toma> any clues about https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/73057/ ?
[11:13] <jrib> !sudo  | Rob423
[11:13] <ubotu> Rob423: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:13] <reverseblade> Lunis, when you code, ruby, you don't need an ide
[11:13] <Rob423> do you need to be the root to install a program?
[11:13] <jhaig> graft: OK, thanks again.  It is just that compiz is in one of the default repositories, while beryl isn't.
[11:13] <Rob423> im just trying to load vm tools, cause im running vmware
[11:14] <reverseblade> Rob423, define install in your context
[11:14] <mnoir> Rob423: read. the. page.
[11:14] <Lunis> reverseblade: i meant an ide for c# that i can use for ruby, py, et al
[11:14] <Slart> Rob423: use synaptic... or use sudo apt-get install mysoftware
[11:14] <Rob423> im trying to install VM tools for the vmware software
[11:14] <graft> jhaig: yeah, not yet - but you can find auxiliary repositories pretty easily - try beryl-project.org
[11:14] <youser> anyone?
[11:14] <john76> sigh
[11:14] <Rob423> download synaptic?
[11:14] <john76> editing that did nothing
[11:14] <reverseblade> Lunis, may be eclipse with its plugins
[11:14] <reverseblade> Rob423, VM ?
[11:14] <Lunis> reverseblade: alrighty, thanks, i'll look in to it :)
[11:14] <UbuntuRob> For some reason my Ubuntu is laggy as hell updating the visual screen image; Any clue how to fix that?
[11:14] <milli> Help?  I search the FAQ and hardware info, but can't find an answer.  Does 6.10 support the HighPoint 2310 SATA controller?  (for install)
[11:14] <UbuntuRob> I have a Dual XPProSP2 boot
[11:15] <Rob423> vm-ware workstation.  virtual machine software
[11:15] <Slart> Rob423: I'm going to refer to what mnoir said.... read the page suggested to you.. it's easier than us repeating it all to you
[11:15] <reverseblade> Rob423, you mean vmware ? ahh to install windows ?
[11:15] <reverseblade> milli, google it
[11:15] <mnoir> it is also very well written!
[11:15] <Rob423> nah, i have windows installed, i used vmware to install linux
[11:15] <reverseblade> milli, seek for linux support not ubunut
[11:15] <Rob423> just to fool around
[11:15] <milli> reverseblade: I did, nothing specific for Ubuntu comes up
[11:15] <UbuntuRob> ?
[11:15] <graft> UbuntuRob: what are you running? gnome?
[11:16] <reverseblade> milli, dont be concerned about ubuntu, if it works for linux it will work for ubuntu
[11:16] <milli> reverseblade: HighPoint distributes a binary driver, but it's core is proprietary, like fglrx is..
[11:16] <UbuntuRob> Ubuntu 6.10
[11:16] <Rob423> yea
[11:16] <Rob423> the newest one on the site
[11:16] <Rob423> it said get this for the latest things or whatever
[11:16] <reverseblade> Rob423, dunno never done before that
[11:16] <milli> reverseblade: I'm concerned,  because the install disk needs to support it  ;-)  All my drives will be on that controller.
[11:16] <HuibertGill> Rob423: yould you be a bit more precise :-)
[11:16] <fenrig> the command
[11:16] <fenrig> cvs  doesnt work
[11:17] <reverseblade> milli, good luck I dunno
[11:17] <Rob423> i got the 6.10
[11:17] <fenrig> what do i have to do to make it work
[11:17] <Rob423> im lookin at the image file right now
[11:17] <Rob423> it's 6.10
[11:17] <milli> reverseblade: k, ty  :-/

[11:17] <da> command not found
[11:18] <jrib> !enter | fenrig
[11:18] <ubotu> fenrig: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[11:18] <Alakazamz0r_> How can i check to see how much video ram my card has?
[11:18] <Rob423> well #1 im trying to figure out what is my root pw,  and my main goal is to just install these VM tools needed for VMware
[11:18] <reverseblade> Alakazamz0r, try #linux
[11:18] <Jet2k5__> Hello I'm trying to install windows
[11:18] <graft> UbuntuRob: um, try top
[11:18] <Infeliz> lots of questions :D
[11:18] <fenrig> can sombody help me
[11:18] <da> wrong channel then if windows
[11:19] <reverseblade> Jet2k5__, check out forums there is an excellent topic for vmware
[11:19] <fenrig> i cant let the cvs version installed
[11:19] <HuibertGill> Rob423: ok,I think I understand, if you are following the vmware instructions, you are told to su. (to get root)
[11:19] <fenrig> what do i have to do
[11:19] <UbuntuRob> Graft; Whats that?
[11:19] <Rob423> yes
[11:19] <jrib> fenrig: please don't use enter as punctuation
[11:19] <Jet2k5__> lmao, just wanted some attention, no seriously though I'm trying to Install Ubuntu, I just downloaded the 6.10 version and my keybaord wont work, any clue as how to get it to work
[11:19] <Rob423> but the thing is, when i su and type my pw it doesn't work
[11:19] <HuibertGill> Rob423: in ubuntu you type "sudo su - " and then provdie _your_ password
[11:19] <graft> UbuntuRob: top - shows running processes and how much memory/cpu time they're using. open up a shell and type 'top'
[11:19] <da> how to install cvs things? it says only command not found for me
[11:19] <UbuntuRob> ok
[11:19] <jrib> Rob423: I don't understand why you don't just read that page and solve your problem
[11:20] <da>  what do i write exactly to install cvs?
[11:20] <reverseblade> Jet2k5__, yes the solution is install windows
[11:20] <fenrig>  	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@gutenprint.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gutenprint login 	
[11:20] <HuibertGill> Rob423: is your current user, the first user created in your newly installed ubuntu?
[11:20] <Rob423> k so just type in the terminal sudo su "robrob" without quotes?
[11:20] <Slart> Jet2k5__: how doesn't it work? wrong colour? broken? some keys dont work? wrong layout?
[11:20] <UbuntuRob> hmm... i see xorg xchat and firefox
[11:20] <john76> ahha
[11:20] <reverseblade> hha
[11:20] <reverseblade> lol
[11:20] <john76> never mind
[11:20] <jrib> Rob423: does the page mention that anywhere?
[11:20] <Jet2k5__> Slart when I go to type something nothing comes up, the keyboards lights are on though
[11:20] <Alakazamz0r_> ty
[11:20] <HuibertGill> Rob423: no, type "sudo su -" ENTER_KEY
[11:21] <Jet2k5__> and it works when I boot the cd as far as hitting enter and stuff
[11:21] <Slart> Jet2k5__: hmm... ordinary standard, wired keyboarD?
[11:21] <da> ok
[11:21] <fenrig> damn
[11:21] <Slart> Jet2k5__: or something exotic? wireless?
[11:21] <reverseblade> Rob423, no quotes
[11:21] <da> and after that?
[11:21] <fenrig> if that doesnt work
[11:21] <refus3d> i just restared X and now whne i start compiz it is only like 1/4 the size of the screen and the rest is black!!!
[11:21] <refus3d> help!!!
[11:21] <HuibertGill> Rob423: again: is your current user, the first user created in your newly installed ubuntu?
[11:21] <fenrig> suse does it without problem
[11:21] <fuffe> reverseblade, ok.. I can make a .tar of the file and transfer it with no problem
[11:21] <graft> UbuntuRob: anything really eating up your cpu a lot?
[11:21] <reverseblade> refus3d, compiz is dead , go for beryl
[11:22] <reverseblade> !beryl | refus3d
[11:22] <ubotu> refus3d: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[11:22] <Rob423> yes
[11:22] <fuffe> (folder)
[11:22] <UbuntuRob> Not that Im seeing graft.
[11:22] <refus3d> does it work with AIGXL??
[11:22] <reverseblade> fuffe, so what was it ?
[11:22] <UbuntuRob> This is weird. lol
[11:22] <reverseblade> refus3d, yes perfectly
[11:22] <Rob423> i only made one user.. during the install i made 1 user, i didn't say anything about ROOT.    it just said create your username and pw
[11:22] <UbuntuRob> I wonder why its done this from the beginning
[11:22] <UbuntuRob> Should I try another apt-get update?
[11:22] <GreenLanter1> Can anybody help me edit my fstab so that a drive will mount on boot?
[11:22] <HuibertGill> Rob423: then the userpassword should be accepted to get a root login with sudo
[11:22] <Rob423> now everytime i start up the ubuntu i use the user/pass to access the desktop
[11:22] <graft> UbuntuRob: um, what exactly is the symptoms, here?
[11:22] <HuibertGill> Rob423: there is no root user in ubunut (sort off)
[11:22] <Rob423> yea i know thats why it's puzzling me
[11:22] <da> sudo apt-get install cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@gutenprint.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gutenprint login
[11:23] <da> dont work
[11:23] <UbuntuRob> Graft the screen literally is laggy as hell.
[11:23] <Rob423> for example.. im using rizzle and 12345 to gain access to my desktop
[11:23] <UbuntuRob> Period.
[11:23] <HuibertGill> Rob423: try again, and describ _exactly_ what output you get.
[11:23] <mnoir> Rob423: why are you unwilling to go to the page that explains how to manage root privs?
[11:23] <Rob423> now when i go to terminal and type su enter.. then 12345
[11:23] <Rob423> it won't work
[11:23] <UbuntuRob> It looks like its "sweeping" from the top to the bottom of the window
[11:23] <reverseblade> Rob423, let me tell you the inner workings . when you create your user, ubuntu sets the same password for root too. But root is a different user. Ubuntu also adds you to the sudo'ers list so that you can use sudo command. Other than this there  is no corrolation
[11:23] <fuffe> reverseblade, well it wasn't anything with the file I changed.. because the old version of the zip worked, then I made a zip with all files I changed from last time(just a few) and it worked
[11:23] <UbuntuRob> the screen refresh is slow as hell
[11:24] <graft> UbuntuRob: ... um, hrm. maybe you specified a really low refresh rate when you set up your xserver?
[11:24] <HuibertGill> Rob423: dont type "su" type "sudo su", focus dude, focus!
[11:24] <da> rob423 write adduser password root
[11:24] <Infeliz> :D
[11:24] <da> adduser passwd root i mean
[11:24] <Infeliz> sudo rm -r /
[11:24] <reverseblade> lol
[11:24] <reverseblade> npo
[11:24] <reverseblade> no
[11:24] <Infeliz> its good command
[11:24] <Dial_tone> heh
[11:24] <graft> da: you meant sudo passwd root, eh?
[11:24] <HuibertGill> da: don't confuse him please
[11:24] <Infeliz> do it!
[11:24] <Infeliz> do it!
[11:24] <Infeliz> do it!
[11:24] <UbuntuRob> Not sure Graft; how can I fix it
[11:24] <reverseblade> ping Seveas

[11:25] <Slart> Infeliz: hmm.. not sure you should throw around commands like that in a help channel.. someone might try it
[11:25] <DARKGuy> Great
[11:25] <Rob423> so does this mean im all good to go?
[11:25] <Slart> Infeliz: =)
[11:25] <Infeliz> :D
[11:25] <HuibertGill> Rob423: you got _root_! you can proceed now (may the source be with you, young skywalker)
[11:25] <Rob423> now after doing a sudo su .. my terminal says.  root@rizzle-desktop:/home/rizzle#
[11:25] <afg> 123
[11:25] <DARKGuy> thanks ompaul :D
[11:26] <reverseblade> Rob423, you are root now
[11:26] <HuibertGill> Rob423: and _please_ read the page about sudo, it has very inportant information
[11:26] <Rob423> ok so what was the problem in the first place... how come i had to use sudo su instead of just su?
[11:26] <DARKGuy> gotta go people
[11:26] <ompaul> thank nalioth more :)
[11:26] <UbuntuRob> I wish I could figure this thing out
[11:26] <jrib> Infeliz: please don't write those commands here
[11:26] <reverseblade> Rob423, that's debian philosophy and long story, I like it better
[11:26] <HuibertGill> !sudo | Rob423
[11:26] <ubotu> Rob423: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:26] <Infeliz>  okay, i dont think they are so stuidid
[11:26] <Slart> Rob423: 5 people have told you already... at least...pretty pretty pretty please read the page you were directed to
[11:27] <psyke83> hi, where's the best place to insert a script that I wanted started when I log in?
[11:27] <reverseblade> Rob423 is a great kernel hacker and making for of us
[11:27] <psyke83> .bashrc isn't ideal, it only starts when I open a terminal...
[11:27] <reverseblade> lol
[11:27] <jrib> psyke83: system > preferences > session > startup
[11:28] <reverseblade> making fun of us
[11:28] <Rob423> ahhaha how'd you know
[11:28] <Rob423> you caught me
[11:28] <Rob423> lol
[11:28] <reverseblade> hehe
[11:28] <genben> hi all, what is the correct java/jre package to install java 1.5.x onto edgy eft? i just tried 'apt-get install sun-java5-jre sun-java5-plugin' ...failed
[11:28] <Rob423> nah im brand new to linux so this is a huge change from MS
[11:28] <HuibertGill> is this a test?
[11:28] <jrib> genben: do you have multiverse?
[11:28] <genben> i do
[11:28] <reverseblade> HuibertGill, everything is a test
[11:28] <vanberge> is the only way to change color depth by ediitng the xorg.conf file?
[11:29] <iturk> hi there everytime that we delete a file accidentally is there a way to recover it ??
[11:29] <vanberge> i want to go from 24 to 16
[11:29] <jrib> genben: pastebin your sources.list please
[11:29] <graft> genben: 'correct' and 'java' is an oxymoron, isn't it?
[11:29] <reverseblade> Rob423, I see, don't worry you will be fine 3 years later. Seriously !
[11:29] <genben> k, will
[11:29] <HuibertGill> reverseblade: yeah, I know, "do or don't, there is no try"
[11:29] <reverseblade> lol
[11:29] <okaratas> hi
[11:29] <reverseblade> iturk, yes but you have to unmount that partition
[11:30] <graft> UbuntuRob: um, look at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:30] <HuibertGill> iturk: have you looked in the Trash :-)
[11:30] <genben> jrib: my mistake, it is not in the sources.list, i'll fix and try again
[11:30] <iturk> reverseblade: ok i can do that from a live cd what else
[11:30] <jrib> genben: k
[11:30] <graft> UbuntuRob: and see if there's a line in there for refresh rates (just search for refresh)
[11:30] <iturk> HuibertGill: i have user rm from a shell i check thrash is not there
[11:30] <reverseblade> iturk, search for undelete, recover from synaptic and install those, that you cant from a live CD I guess
[11:30] <iturk> HuibertGill: i have used i mean
[11:31] <HuibertGill> iturk: oh, so might be "backup replay time" :-)
[11:31] <jhaig> graft: I've got beryl working now.  Thanks for the help.
[11:31] <reverseblade> iter, there are programs for this task
[11:31] <HuibertGill> iturk: you do backups, don't you
[11:31] <graft> jhaig: sweet! enjoy :P
[11:31] <iturk> reverseblade: i can do the live cd just for the unmount part
[11:31] <jhaig> Woah!  Wobbley windows!  :-)
[11:31] <reverseblade> well you need to use additional program
[11:31] <reverseblade> iter, what is something you have to install
[11:31] <iturk> HuibertGill: i just mv a movie that i download for 3 week accidentally
[11:31] <reverseblade> iturk, that is something you need to install
[11:32] <reverseblade> iturk, live CD wont work I guess
[11:32] <graft> jhaig: my favorite thing is the mac expose clone
[11:32] <iturk> reverseblade: ok i will install undelete and see what i can do
[11:32] <HuibertGill> iturk: so the internet(bittorrent) is your backup
[11:32] <jhaig> graft: Well, I'll have to play around with it a bit.
[11:32] <iturk> HuibertGill: actually its emule
[11:33] <iturk> HuibertGill: but i would not see the movie today
[11:33] <graft> jhaig: it's not that feature-rich yet... there's some neat plugins (3dworld especially), but it's under heavy development, so i think it has a bright future
[11:33] <HuibertGill> iturk: yep, but we're getting OT
[11:33] <reverseblade> how can I be a Jedi ?
[11:34] <we2by> lol
[11:34] <HuibertGill> reverseblade: "use the source"
[11:34] <reverseblade> can I install it via synaptic ?
[11:34] <HuibertGill> reverseblade: you might have to go for a gentoo instal :-)

[11:35] <drkm> I am trying to view my home dir with naturirs (however it's spelt like) but for some reason naturris seems to freeze and not view the dir.. when I force quit it.. it just loads up again and does the same thing.. does anyone know what can cause this?
[11:35] <HuibertGill> !xen
[11:35] <ubotu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy

[11:36] <HuibertGill> drkm: is nautilus eating CPU because you have a lot off files in your home dir (jpg, mp3)?
=== mcmahonm is now known as mcmahonm[A] 
[11:37] <kralcymerej> can anyone help me convert my *.shn files to mp3s?
[11:37] <drkm> HuibertGill: I've got about 5 movies, and 4 pics... is that a lot for nautilus
[11:37] <graft> kralcymerej: try mencoder?
[11:37] <iturk> HuibertGill: i will start to use the kexplorer instead of console !! since its too dangerous when touching important stuf
[11:37] <reverseblade> kralcymerej, what is shn ?
[11:37] <HuibertGill> drkm: maybe it is traing to index those files,
[11:37] <kralcymerej> mencoder?
[11:37] <graft> kralcymerej: oh wait, mencoder won't work with just mp3s... ffmpeg
[11:37] <kralcymerej> shn is a lossless audio format
[11:38] <drkm> HuibertGill: is this going to happen with every dir which has pictures and music? can I stop this happening some how??
[11:38] <HuibertGill> iturk: if you cann't trust your ngers you type commands, who can you trust?

[11:38] <DigitalNinja> I'm trying to use the i810 driver. How do I get 3d working?
[11:38] <HuibertGill> drkm: it is just a guess, and yes it can be disabled, but I forgot how, sorry
[11:39] <reverseblade> !intel
[11:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about intel - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:39] <iturk> HuibertGill: i can thrust my mind the fingers are the problem i should not thrust them
[11:39] <desaparecido> how can I sort a file of word (separator \n) lexicographically? (sort it's strange
[11:39] <reverseblade> !i810
[11:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i810 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:39] <kralcymerej> i've loaded "soundconverter" from the repo. and it see's the files but no conversion
[11:39] <drkm> huil: I think you're right anyway, the only thing that has change is more pics/movies
[11:39] <reverseblade> kralcymerej, just convert it to wav and then convert it to mp3 you will be fine
[11:40] <desaparecido> for example it put 00a and after 00.
[11:40] <HuibertGill> drkm: try moving those files aside in an terminal, and start nautilus again

[11:40] <Infeliz> hi!
[11:40] <reverseblade> hi
[11:40] <graft> desaparecido: isn't that right? 00 after 00a?
[11:40] <cristos> got a problem with sound on Ubuntu Edgy on a Compaq N620c
[11:40] <graft> desaparecido: i mean 00a after 00 is correct
[11:40] <genben> jrib: multiverse add fixed it, firefox plugin works, is it worhtwhile getting JRE v5.0 Update 10?
[11:41] <drkm> HuibertGill: yep just did that and it fixed it.. thanks.. now I gota work out how to fix nautilis hehe
[11:41] <kralcymerej> sound converter will not convert it to anything it says "conversion done in XXX seconds" but when you go to look for the file it's not there
[11:41] <reverseblade> !sound | cristos
[11:41] <jrib> genben: not for me
[11:41] <ubotu> cristos: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[11:41] <graft> desaparecido: e.g. in a dictionary butt comes before butthead
[11:41] <HuibertGill> drkm: then nautilus is not broken....
[11:41] <genben> so you would rather update using apt-get?
[11:41] <gpled> can the ubuntu live 6.06 write to ntfs?
[11:41] <reverseblade> kralcymerej, forget about that program seek for another converter to convert your files to vaw
[11:41] <drkm> huib: in a sense it is, it freezes with just 5 pictures in my home dir.. that shouldn't happen :)
[11:41] <jrib> genben: exactly
[11:42] <graft> drkm: do you have previews enabled or something?
[11:42] <reverseblade> drkm, try nautilus --debug or gdb nautiles then retry
[11:42] <graft> dunno if nautilus even has previews...
[11:42] <nceterval> Since trying to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy using apt, I have been getting the following error from dpkg all day: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37240/  I am unable to finish my upgrade or do any package management.  Can anyone help me?
[11:42] <genben> jrib: k, thanks for tip
[11:42] <edd_> can anybody help, sound doesnt work in any of the web browsers??
[11:42] <drkm> reverseblade: is that from console?
[11:42] <desaparecido> graft, yeah but the point 00a before 00. and after aab
[11:42] <cristos> the problem is that the sound is ok, but only through the headphones, no sound through built in speakers at all
[11:42] <HuibertGill> drkm: if those pics are "small", then you are right, if you are patient it will crate thumbnails for those pics, the next time you start nautilus it should be fast
