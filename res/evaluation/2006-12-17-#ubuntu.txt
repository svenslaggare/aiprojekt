[12:02] <christiane> nevron, jesse: What could I check first?

[12:05] <gnomefreak> wimpies: i would wait for crimsun and ask him if he shows up.

=== Administrator is now known as admin123
[12:09] <specialdave> so how do i caht/talk
[12:09] <jesse> acke:> the "server" just means that It can create a VM just like wine can it's just that it can virtually run windows
[12:09] <Everflex> specialdave: no ppl in there to talk to :)
[12:09] <specialdave> sorry my mistake
[12:09] <Everflex> specialdave: you are obviously chatting/talking right now :D

[12:10] <anomaly> any ideas why my wireless card is not getting better than 11megabits? my windows box next to it is the same card and doing fine at 54g ?
[12:10] <Kickersny> is it possible to re-configure a program that was installed via apt-get (specifically, PHP)
[12:10] <Phreddy_Pfander> that's just for typing commands to get the server to do stuff for you specialdave
[12:10] <Everflex> specialdave: ah, ok. no talking in there. It's for announcing official stuff from the server admins side....
[12:11] <hujciwdupe> what do i need to do to get the dos2unix command to work???
[12:11] <acke> jesse, so it has a vm already that i can use?
[12:11] <jesse> kickersny:>apt-get install php
[12:11] <jesse> acke:> no, but you can create one
[12:12] <Kickersny> jesse, I need to rereun ./configure with different options, though
[12:12] <jesse> acke:> not hard
[12:12] <Kickersny> for an additional library
[12:12] <acke> jesse okay
[12:12] <specialdave> basically...made the cd image...and ubuntu takes ages to load...then when i click on the install thing it doesnt do anything

[12:12] <christiane> jesse: I installed fglrx and now got 1280x800. Before (after install of ubuntu) only vesa (1024x768) was possible. Problem is: Playing video gives me onyl about 10 fps. I did the composite and the overlay entray in xorg.conf but it doesn't get better. Why doeas `fglrxinfo` say "mesa3d"?
[12:12] <jesse> kickersny:>what do you mean?
[12:13] <Kickersny> jesse, php.net/exif states that to enable EXIF extension, you configure with --enable-exif when compiling
[12:13] <mon^rch> can anyone tell me how to add compiz themes???
[12:13] <jesse> christiane:> because the chipset is different that the manufactors name
[12:13] <Kickersny> however, apt-get install doesn't prompt for config options, AFAIK
[12:13] <acke> jesse is there a good howto for vmware somewere?
[12:14] <jesse> acke:> on the vmware site
[12:14] <jesse> kickersny:> no
[12:14] <christiane> jesse: Ok, I don't really need 3D support, but good 2D performance. What could I do?
[12:14] <jesse> kickersny:> you can't there is no other way except to execute them separtly
[12:14] <Kickersny> jesse, thanks, I'll Google around some more or just recompile from source
[12:14] <jesse> kickersny:> welcome

[12:15] <bradley> is there a way to import the xfce panel apps into the gnome panel?
[12:15] <Curs0r> anyone know any easy way to flip a window horizontally so it displays right-left instead of left-right?
[12:15] <Curs0r> mplayer specifically but it could come in handy again i think
[12:16] <jesse> christiane:> mines on the pci bridge
[12:16] <jesse> so...
[12:16] <jesse> you can either get it from the microsoft, ubuntu, or ati site
[12:17] <jesse> i think
[12:17] <Everflex> curs0r: no, but i know how to invert the colors and make it go on the side of a cube :P
[12:17] <wasp_ems> hi..does anyone know how to install gnome-dock?
[12:17] <jrib> Curs0r: use mplayer's filters, maybe rotate and flip
[12:17] <Curs0r> Everflex, what does that mean?
[12:17] <christiane> jesse: Get what?
[12:18] <Curs0r> jrib, it doesn't seem to mind a vertical flip
[12:18] <jesse> christiane:> the correct driver

[12:27] <SilentDis> mikebot:  while I might not be able to help you directly... lets define what you have, so someone might be better apt to be able to help.  I assume it goes phone jack > dsl modem > ethernet cable > computer, and you need to use PPPoE to use your DSL service?
[12:27] <mikebot> SilentDis: that's correct
[12:27] <malt1> mikebot: I'm not sure i use a router
[12:28] <n2diy> how can I configure Nautilus to archive recursively?

[12:41] <acke> jesse, hehe damn i really dont want to have to reinstall windows again.. id hope to not even have to use win in vmware
[12:41] <chorse> mikebot: it must be your gateway, it's likely that the ip ends with .1
[12:41] <LjL> chemist: if you can make that a GTK-but-not-GNOME application, it would help, since i'm on KDE
[12:42] <jesse> you mean you installed vmware on windows!?
[12:42] <mikebot> chorse: hehe, none of them end in '1', and i have 2 gateways

[12:45] <Jussi01> hei all
[12:45] <chemist> LjL: firefox takes about 1 minute to open
[12:45] <Jussi01> got a small problem, I wonder if some one can help
[12:45] <cchristianJEW> hey
[12:45] <cchristianJEW> where can I get a linux that is small, easy to install, and I can run along with Windows?
[12:46] <Flannel> cchristianJEW: all linuxes can be installed along side windows
[12:46] <LjL> chemist: with the computer idle, does "top" look like anything is eating up the processor?
[12:46] <Kondor> h
[12:46] <n2diy> cchristianJEW: minimal Ubuntu
[12:46] <cchristianJEW> #linux = EMPTY    so I came here
[12:46] <cchristianJEW> hmm
[12:46] <SilentDis> cchristianJEW:  well... ubuntu is good... so is DSL (damn small linux), but it's mainly for low-end hardware, and isn't exactly all that 'pretty'.  as for "run along with windows" do you mean 'run under windows' or 'run on the same machine as windows runs on'?
[12:46] <[maTa] > i have limewire 4.12 and it cannot connect to the network...i dont have firewall, selinux up, nothing... any idea why?
[12:46] <bradley_> where can i find a complete list (preferable with notes and screenshots) of gnome-panel apps?  does such a magical place exist?
[12:47] <chemist> LjL: cpu usage doesn't go more than 8%
[12:47] <cchristianJEW> I got some ubuntu hat want's to be on a CD for some reasn...
[12:47] <LjL> chemist: what about the HD? does "sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/hda" (change hda for whatever your HD is) show a reasonable speed?
[12:48] <cchristianJEW> ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386
[12:48] <HYB> cchristianJEW, what about it?
[12:48] <n2diy> cchristianJEW: check out minimal Ubuntu, it is a 7.4m iso.
[12:48] <bling-g-one> Hi everyone
[12:48] <HYB> hi
[12:48] <cchristianJEW> how do I install it after I download?
[12:48] <Flannel> n2diy: it's installed size isn't 7.4mb though
[12:48] <HYB> Burn it to a CD
[12:49] <HYB> burn the .ISO to a CD
[12:49] <HYB> and boot from it
[12:49] <jon_> burn it as an image not date
[12:49] <bling-g-one> I'd like to connect to A Wifi router but their is no field in the configuration menu for a WPA . What should I do?
[12:49] <SilentDis> cchristianJEW:  you download the ISO file, burn it to a cd, put it in your machine, and reboot.  you'll be in linux, without modifying your current machine
[12:49] <macr0_> Does anyone know how I can flush my client dns cache in ubuntu?  Sorry if this is a repeat, I got disconnected and didn't see if the question got through.  Thanks in advance!
[12:49] <n2diy> Flannel, I haven't installed it yet, can you avoid Open Office when you do your install?
[12:50] <cchristianJEW> ahh
[12:50] <au_> I need a script to be run after start..where should I copy it?
[12:50] <SilentDis> eep, someone killed the bots!
[12:50] <cchristianJEW> that's wonderfull
[12:50] <cchristianJEW> thanks
[12:50] <cchristianJEW> bye
[12:50] <Flannel> n2diy: the mini iso is identical in functionality as the alternate CD, except instead of having packages on the CD, it downloads them.  So, if you do the "server" install, from the mini/alternate ISO, then yes.  You'll have a normal GUI-less desktop,w hich you can then install whatever from
[12:50] <Jussi01> when I go to install a program with add remove programs i get this error message: This application conflicts with other installed software. To install 'gnome-office' the conflicting software must be removed before.
[12:50] <Jussi01> Switch to the advanced mode to resolve this conflict.
[12:50] <Pelo> does anyone know if there is a channel for open office ?
[12:50] <LjL> !minimal
[12:50] <au_> I need a script to be run after start..where should I copy it?
[12:50] <Flannel> Jussi01: try doing it in synaptic package manager, instead of "add/remove"
[12:51] <bling-g-one> I'd like to connect to A Wifi router but their is no field in the configuration menu for a WPA . What should I do?
[12:51] <SilentDis> Pelo:  there is, but ubotu just left, and he has that info
[12:51] <Pelo> damit
[12:51] <Jussi01> thanks flannel
[12:51] <SilentDis> pelo:  stick around, and when he comes back, type !openoffice
[12:51] <n2diy> Flannel: roger that, what would a minimal install with a thin Xserver need disk wise?
[12:51] <SilentDis> there he is
[12:51] <Pelo> thanks SilentDis  I know how to work the bot
[12:51] <Pelo> !openoffice
[12:52] <HYB> ...
[12:52] <HYB> fail.
[12:52] <Flannel> n2diy: size on disk?  Um, no idea.  Not much though.  since all you need is X
[12:52] <jon_> bling-g-one: just enter the wpa password in the passoword field
[12:52] <bling-g-one> jon_, should I choose "plain text" or "hexadecimal?"
[12:52] <SilentDis> pelo:  no, you didn't. i assume they're having issue is all.
[12:52] <n2diy> Flannel, ok, got some old hardware I want to put back in service.
[12:53] <LjL> Pelo: no, just wait a second
[12:53] <ubotu> a free and open source office suite, including word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, vector drawing and database components.  To install: "sudo apt-get install openoffice.org". User help available in #users.openoffice.org
[12:53] <Pelo> I got my answer from  #help anyway, thanks guys
[12:53] <Flannel> n2diy: yeah, you'll want the alternate/mini iso, then do a "server" install at the install prompt (this 'server' is different than the server iso), then build up from there.
[12:53] <jon_> bling-g-one: is the password a word or is it a bunch of letters and numbers?
[12:54] <bling-g-one> jon_, it's a word
[12:54] <green_earz> au_: to have a script start after boot. the place where the script go is /etc/init.d   have a look at this link for help with /etc/init.d scripts >http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/28
[12:54] <ola_> I'm having an issue with getting logs from a remote machine to be placed in a separate file and not in /var/log/syslog Anyone familiar with that? I'm using syslogd.
[12:54] <jon_> bling-g-one: try plain text
[12:54] <Flannel> n2diy: depending on how old they are, you might be able to get by with fluxbox/etc, instead of a thinclient thing
[12:54] <n2diy> can I configure Nautilus to archive files and directories recursively?
[12:55] <jon_> bling-g-one: brb
[12:55] <foob> which kubuntu version should i get, i don't want the stable/lts version that has the old software, i want firefox2.0 and stuff
[12:55] <HYB> Kubuntu 6.10
[12:55] <Pelo> foob,  edgy  ei  6.10
[12:56] <foob> pelo not 'feisty herd'?
[12:56] <n2diy> Flannel, ok, I'm not sure what I'm dealing with yet, but I would like to stay with Ubuntu.
[12:56] <HYB> foo, no that's beta
[12:56] <HYB> or alpha
[12:56] <HYB> I don't know
[12:56] <foob> k
[12:56] <jon_> bling-g-one: did the plain text work?
[12:56] <Flannel> n2diy: yeah, well, you'll be able to install that, which is a barebones install, then add some, see if it works, if not, remove, etc.
[12:56] <Pelo> food  ff 2.0 is the default browser in edgy
[12:57] <Pelo> and food edgy is also the current version
[12:57] <n2diy> food, load the stable, and then use apt-get to upgrade to the stuff you want.
[12:57] <foob> id rather do a fresh install because my ubuntu stable is broken
[12:58] <schlonzo> how can i activate aixgl?
[12:58] <bboy00> part
[12:58] <n2diy> Flannel, roger that, I'm pretty good at "removing" stuff.
[12:58] <bling-g-one> jon_, nope, I'm sure the card is active because the radio button is on, but when I look at the properties of the wireless connection (ath0) it says that the signal force is 0%.. any clues?
[12:58] <jon_> bling-g-one: is it your router?
[12:58] <foob> does kubuntu have the same install processes as ubuntu
[12:59] <Pelo> food yes
[12:59] <LjL> foob: quite similar
[12:59] <bling-g-one> jon_,   yes
[12:59] <bling-g-one> jon_, it's in the same room as my computer
[12:59] <jon_> bling-g-one: can you try using a different type of crypto
[12:59] <n2diy> foob, not really, you have at least to install choices, server, or client. It is designed for thin client networking.
[12:59] <jon_> bling-g-one: wep instead of wpa
[01:00] <kane77> hi
[01:00] <jon_> bling-g-one: just to see if that is the issue
[01:00] <kane77> a plain question: Is it worth upgrading to edgy?? (i read some threads its buggy...)

[01:01] <jason_> How do I build PKGBUILD Files?
[01:01] <Pelo> Kane unless you have a very good reason to,  I wouldn't ,  I have regretted it
[01:01] <jon_> only buggy if installed from upgrade
[01:01] <Flannel> daimoh: dpkg -l
[01:01] <daimoh> thx flannel
[01:01] <jon_> do clean intall if you are going to do it
[01:01] <bling-g-one> jon_, No I can't because this a router in a shared house and I'm not the one who configured it .. sorry.
[01:01] <kane77> Pelo, why?
[01:02] <jon_> bling-g-one: it isn't your router than
[01:03] <Kirby904> need help, how do i get the microsoft truetype core fonts on linux?
[01:03] <jon_> bling-g-one: most routers allow you to login via a browser to configure them. By deafult most are at http://192.168.11.1/
[01:03] <Pelo> kane77,  minor things seem to cause problems ,  when I try and add a icon to a launcher all the png don'T get displayed in preview,  fille association seems buggy for some apps,  i have to load files into rythbox manualy, for exemple

[01:04] <Temp_pennywise> Madywifi frmo linux-headers are missing
[01:04] <foob> is the install process from the dvd the same as from the cd. the only different being that the dvd has more 'offline' files available once it's already installed?
[01:04] <Temp_pennywise> Is it possible to install them again
[01:04] <Pelo> kane77,  I tried upgrading but it only screwed up mty setup so I did a clean install
[01:04] <Flannel> SpiX^: you'd really need to ask the psyBNC people, but it looks as if you don't have some SSL library
[01:05] <jon_> bling-g-one: you could try the wireless assistant tool
[01:05] <Kirby904> wait, the real question is.. is ubuntu a rpm based distro?
[01:05] <SpiX^> what ?
[01:05] <kane77> Kirby904, no...
[01:05] <Kirby904> o ok
[01:05] <bling-g-one> jon_,  wher can I get it ?

[01:06] <Temp_pennywise> How do I uninstall linux-headers?
[01:06] <Flannel> SpiX^: you need SSL libraries.  But, psyBNC is not supported by Ubuntu, you'd need to consult their documentation on what libraries you might need.  It's definately something SSL related though

[01:08] <jon_> bling-g-one:  type this in the terminal to install it:  sudo apt-get wlassistant
[01:08] <brucedes> foob: I'd recommend you backup windows anyway
[01:08] <kane77> Temp_pennywise, I'd try sudo apt-get remove linux-header-version
[01:08] <zidoen> i've got "bouncing keys" on my Dell laptop and fixed it with adding something to menu.lst in grun.. something like "tcr", but i can't remember and i can't find the article again.. anybody remember?
[01:08] <foob> brucedes it's backed up just wondering if thats all i need to do
[01:08] <brucedes> Pretty much yes
[01:09] <brucedes> or keep existing partitions and just reformat them
[01:09] <bling-g-one> jon_,  ok thanks I'll try this
[01:09] <Kirby904> mnoir i was trying to avoid that, because it always gives me some long instructions =S, whenever i ask something on here someone just says "say this command in console" and done.

[01:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rss - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:22] <daimoh> how do i find out what files are in an installed package?
[01:22] <LjL> lifepositive: don't abuse the bot... ask it about "!best" instead ;)
[01:22] <LjL> lifepositive: i use knode
[01:22] <ianthepetrock> leach: since i downloaded off the website, it gave me an execuatble file
[01:22] <LjL> actually, i don't
[01:22] <lifepositive> whats the best reader for newsgroups?
[01:22] <ryanakca> LjL: something like this should do the trick, right? apt-file search `echo `ldd /usr/local/kde/bin/kssh | awk '{print $1}'``
[01:22] <ianthepetrock> you could try typing "shoutcast" in the console maybe
[01:22] <lifepositive> LjL: knode will download news?
[01:22] <leachizzle> can i PM you?
[01:22] <ianthepetrock> sure
[01:23] <ryanakca> daimoh: find the the package and list the contents with http://packages.ubuntu.com
[01:23] <LjL> ryanakca: i think so. but are you just doing this to find out the depends for one program, or do you have something more than that in mind?
[01:23] <lifepositive> Seveas: whats the best reader for newsgroups using Gnome?
[01:23] <leachizzle> lol can you pm me i cant find it or remember the / thingy
[01:23] <daimoh> ryanakca: ah kk - thanks
[01:23] <brohken> can anyone recommend a good laptop that will work out of the box with ubuntu, be cheap, and be able to run Beryl
[01:23] <leachizzle> msg ianthepetrock
[01:23] <LjL> lifepositive: uhm, since it's a newsreader... but it's definitely not for gnome
[01:24] <ianthepetrock> leach
[01:24] <leachizzle> yea
[01:24] <ryanakca> LjL: depends for 1 program
[01:24] <ianthepetrock> its not working i guess im not registered
[01:24] <lifepositive> LjL: I realised that :)
[01:24] <leachizzle> Gmail?

[01:24] <leachizzle> AIm?
[01:24] <leachizzle> oh kk
[01:24] <LjL> ryanakca: then do it manually, how many libraries can it be! :P
[01:24] <brohken> anyone? sorry to rush, but I gotta run soon
[01:24] <wimpies> gnomefreak : Still here have a problem with mounting an external usb disk who wants to mount on /media/external-1 but I want it on /media/external
[01:25] <eutu> cant boot my ubuntu it gets to the point where it starts to load the desktop and stops
[01:25] <LjL> ryanakca: ah but wait, no, that's not going to work
[01:25] <PriceChild> brohken: go to the store with a live cd and ask to test them out
[01:25] <DjViper> Hi, I've got a problem sharing files with windows computers using samba, its slow
[01:25] <LjL> ryanakca: nevermind, it should
[01:25] <PriceChild> if they don't let you... you REALLY don't want to be buying from that store
[01:25] <PriceChild> brohken: ^
[01:25] <brohken> PriceChild, thanks but I wanted to see if anyone had some experience with one already
[01:26] <brohken> im sure there is someone in this room running ubuntu on a laptop with good things to say
[01:26] <brohken> i'd just like to know the model and how much they paid
[01:26] <brohken> heh
[01:26] <foo> foob: Back off my foo hizzl'
[01:27] <leachizzle> ianthepetrock~ im linkincable@gmail.com i intived you for a chat
[01:27] <ianthepetrock> i got it
[01:27] <brohken> do laptops with Nvidia cards tend to work right out of the box?
[01:28] <sc0tt> yes brohken
[01:28] <PriceChild> brohken: I would get Nvidia above all else
[01:28] <brohken> i noticed the dell I wanted will work... but I need to change alot to make it work with the ati card
[01:28] <evil_> My flash objects in Firefox don't have sound...Is this a documented problem?
[01:28] <sc0tt> i'd go nvidia
[01:28] <brohken> which kind of sucks. im not too good with command line
[01:28] <PriceChild> evil_: there's a wiki entry on it
[01:28] <PriceChild> evil_: one second
[01:28] <evil_> kk..
[01:28] <brohken> what exactly does it mean to mount something?
[01:28] <LjL> ryanakca: try this, for some reason your version doesn't seem to work here: ldd /usr/local/kde/bin/kssh | awk ' { print $1 } ' | xargs -n 1 basename | xargs -n 1 apt-file search
[01:29] <PriceChild> evil_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-c268ba69c6b38af1dc31ea09701c7d296cf971c3
[01:29] <evil_> Thanks
[01:29] <PriceChild> scroll to the bottom
[01:29] <LjL> ryanakca: (one thing is that apt-file doesn't store the leading "/" in filenames, so if ldd gives you results that include that, it won't work -- then it's also not working for some other reason probably related to newlines)
[01:29] <PriceChild> evil_: well not bottom... but bottom of hte section
[01:29] <evil_> kk
[01:30] <LjL> ryanakca: see also https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoDeb - i've done that sort of thing in the past as you can see =)
[01:30] <Vessquire> I've got an ubuntu server... I want to use it to share folders that will show up (through avahi/zeroconf/however) in the Finder on the mac machines on the network... anyone have any ideas?   I've seen tutorials for shared music libraries, but nothing for shared folders
[01:31] <green_earz> brohken: say you mount a cd disk it then becomes part of the filing system,
[01:31] <philo23> hey, i'm having problems using frostwire/limewire
[01:31] <n2diy> can I configure Nautilus to archive files and directories recursively?
[01:31] <brohken> green_earz, thanks.
[01:31] <green_earz> np
[01:31] <brohken> last question for now: does anyone know off the top of their heads any laptops that come with nvidia cards?
[01:32] <philo23> hey, i'm having problems using frostwire/limewire, it apears java isnt working, i just get a grey screen, but i know java is working, so i dont know whats up, i've checked the version
[01:32] <noiesmo> philo23, are you running compiz or beryl ?
[01:32] <philo23> noiesmo: yes, does that effect it?
[01:32] <brohken> what does this mean: Video (ATI x1300 and most other new ATI)
[01:32] <brohken> **For Edgy Follow this how to:**
[01:32] <brohken> 1. FIRST DOWNLOAD THE ATI DRIVER AT THE FOLLOWING HOW TO AND CHMOD IT TO BE EXECUTABLE USING +x, THEN RUN IT AS ROOT AND INSTALL THE DRIVERS FIRST.
[01:33] <islan> when I try to run ./configure, I keep getting this message:  checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... no
[01:33] <islan> is something wrong with my gcc and should I get another version of it?
[01:33] <fokuslee> supernoob question:  How do i kill man after i open the manual in terminal? ^C does not work for me ^Z suspend it but can't kill the prcoess with kill PID
[01:33] <LjL> Ubotu, tell islan about build-essential | islan, see the private message from Ubotu
[01:33] <PriceChild> islan: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:33] <brohken> chmod? isn't that chmod 777 or something?
[01:33] <noiesmo> philo23, I dont really know all I know is when I run beryl i get the blank screen if I run normal say metacity or kwin as Im on kde it works
[01:33] <PriceChild> LjL: too quick :P
[01:33] <islan> fokuslee, hit command :q
[01:34] <philo23> noiesmo: thanks, i'll try it out
[01:34] <LjL> brohken: "chmod +x filename" sets a file as executable
[01:34] <LjL> brohken: the octal notation isn't the only possible notation in chmod
[01:34] <LjL> Ubotu, tell brohken about permissions | brohken, see the private message from Ubotu
[01:34] <philo23> yep, it apears Beryl is doing something
[01:35] <angel12> hey guys, is anyone else having problems using gaim right now? the stock one with edgy?
[01:35] <noiesmo> philo23, yeah I asked in beryl channel see if any one knows
[01:35] <clemyeats> brohken: the octal notation is to set, use the letters to "modify"
[01:35] <brohken> ohhh thanks
[01:35] <Shadow_mil> how can I get nautilus to see dirs mounted with FUSE?
[01:35] <brohken> one LAST LAST thing and I swear I'll leave
[01:35] <LjL> clemyeats: that's not really true. it's really just a matter of preferences: you can "set" using the letters, as well.
[01:36] <clemyeats> LjL: I know.. I didn't want to confuse him too much :)
[01:36] <PriceChild> brohken: we'll "allow" you to stay :P
[01:36] <clemyeats> LjL: I wrote an article on that.. let me find the link..
[01:36] <brohken> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=257684 can you take a look at this site and tell me if a noob could follow those commands and instructions? i'm planning to run edgy
[01:36] <philo23> noiesmo: thanks mate
[01:36] <fokuslee> islan: wut do u mean? like i don't want to close the terminal only return to #
[01:36] <noiesmo> philo23, np it's a bit annoying having to switch thou
[01:37] <clemyeats> brohken: http://www.linuxforums.org/security/file_permissions.html that should explain everything :)
[01:37] <islan> fokuslee, while in man, type in a colon followed by a q
[01:37] <islan> fokuslee, like this :q
[01:37] <brohken> clemyeats, its a seperate topic
[01:37] <fokuslee> oh ok
[01:37] <fokuslee> yhahah
[01:37] <fokuslee> sorri i thought dat was a funny face
[01:37] <fokuslee> lmfao
[01:38] <islan> heh, sry, nope
[01:38] <clemyeats> brohken: well, you asked about file permissions..
[01:38] <brohken> clemyeats, just take a quick look and tell me if it should be easy enough
[01:38] <fokuslee> well thx
[01:38] <gaurav19> Hi, I have three partitions on a system running windows XP Pro. Can I install ubuntu without causing any damage to the windows installation
[01:38] <dust> I've got both the vlc and the totem plugins installed in firefox as well as the w32codecs, but when I open pages with wmv movies like this one http://politiken.dk/poltv/?ExtID=1237 it just says (no movie)..
[01:38] <un_operateur1> !dual-boot
[01:38] <brohken> clemyeats, that was before... someone already sent me a message regarding that
[01:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dual-boot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:38] <PriceChild> gaurav19: you "can"... however defrag your drives before attempting resizing
[01:38] <un_operateur1> !dualboot
[01:38] <ubotu> Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[01:38] <dust> weird thing is, in vlc the movies play just fine if I dig for the url manually
[01:38] <clemyeats> brohken: ok no pb.
[01:39] <PriceChild> gaurav19: backup ALL important data
[01:39] <eutu> i can boot as root but cant boot my user account
[01:39] <brohken> clemyeats, thanks
[01:39] <noiesmo> philo23, beryl people know they are working on it :)
[01:39] <PriceChild> eutu: could you explain further please?
[01:39] <philo23> yay
[01:40] <eutu> i try to boot but goes only as far as the splash screen just before loading the desktop then stops
[01:40] <clemyeats> gaurav19: yes, but make sure to backup your data in case you make a mistake.. partitions are called differently in linux than in windows.
[01:40] <jk_> is there a way to have Gnome and KDE installed on the same system and select between the t2o?
[01:40] <ryanakca> LjL: lots :P
[01:41] <ryanakca> LjL: two dozen at least
[01:41] <PriceChild> jk_: yes... sudo aptitude install (x/k)ubuntu-desktop
[01:41] <PriceChild> jk_: you can then choose between them from the "sessions" menu on gdm
[01:41] <PriceChild> (or kdm)
[01:41] <ryanakca> LjL: no?
[01:41] <PriceChild> eutu: what exact point does it halt?
[01:41] <gaurav19> Thanks for the advice, PriceChild. I will back up the data. I do not need to resize. I have three partitions - C(20), D(20) and F(120) in GB. D is completely blank, I was thinking of creating the swap and "/" or root mount points on D which is blank as of now. I guess thats doable
[01:41] <PriceChild> gaurav19: good luck
[01:42] <sindrum> having trouble removing directory, i used rmdir command and this is telling me No such file or directory, any ideas?
[01:42] <gaurav19> I mean to say should not cause any problem.
[01:42] <PriceChild> sindrum: sure its a dir, and that it exists?
[01:42] <eutu> as soon as the small screen that shows the small icons
[01:42] <ryanakca> LjL: now I just need to figure out which ones are usefull... php-doc is definitly not required...
[01:42] <ryanakca> brohken: I'd stay away from dell, btw...
[01:42] <ryanakca> brohken: unless you don't mind paying an extra 50-100$ on something you'll delete as soon as you get... (w**d**s)
[01:42] <ryanakca> xargs: unmatched single quote; by default quotes are special to xargs unless you use the -0 option
[01:42] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, you still need to split D up into two partitions -- for swap and /
[01:42] <brohken> any specific reason?
[01:42] <ryanakca> LjL: well... d'you have kssh?
[01:43] <ryanakca> ah
[01:43] <ryanakca> here, LjL, I'll /msg you what I need solved
[01:43] <gaurav19> thanks, but do you foresee problems or may be I am a bit paranoid here, I have heard people messing up things
[01:43] <clayg> what is the name of the package for google earth?
[01:43] <clayg> i thought it was google-earth
[01:43] <sindrum> yes its a directory and i do see it on my desktop and in the command prompt.... im lost?
[01:43] <clayg> but cannot find it anywhere in synaptic
[01:43] <clayg> does anyone know?
[01:43] <PriceChild> gaurav19: you shouldn't have any problems... just make sure you use the correct drives ;)
=== clayg is now known as ClayG
[01:43] <ryanakca> brohken: no, chmod +x filename
[01:43] <PriceChild> gaurav19: most problems come when resizing...
[01:43] <brohken> ryanakca, recommend me something
[01:44] <brohken> ryanakca, what? what about it?
[01:44] <ryanakca> would running "modinfo scsi_mod" break a system?
[01:44] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, well, Its kinda tricky -- is D: on the same disk as the other two partitions?
[01:44] <Newbie> how do you change to super user on terminal?
[01:44] <gaurav19> Hi un_operateur1, yes I am aware of that, is that something Ubuntu will manage or should i use partition magic for creating the swap partition - i.e split the 20Gb into 19 and 1 or whatever the software permits
[01:44] <un_operateur1> Newbie, sudo su
[01:44] <PriceChild> Newbie: sudo su
[01:44] <gaurav19> Yes on the same disk
[01:44] <Newbie> thx
[01:44] <PriceChild> Newbie: please read wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
[01:45] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, and is D: sandwiched in between the other two?
[01:45] <clemyeats> gaurav19: is it an IDE disk ?
=== DjViper- is now known as DjViper
[01:45] <gaurav19> Yes, clemyeats, it is an IDE disk (master/primary)
[01:45] <clemyeats> gaurav19: then it's called /dev/hda in Linux.
[01:45] <gaurav19> You are right, un_operateur1 the order is C,D,F
[01:46] <clemyeats> gaurav19: your C is most likely /dev/hda1
[01:46] <ryanakca> ASUS, Toshiba?
[01:46] <ryanakca> brohken: what do you want me to recommend?
[01:46] <gaurav19> ok
[01:46] <ScreaminIke> uhm. lets say i ran a script to change ubuntu into "Ubuntu Christian Edition" and now... firefox AND lynx are crippled. wget still works, though, so i've worked out a crude method of browsing the web one wget-ed link at a time. is there a way to fix this situation?
[01:46] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, I think you'll have to split D: into two within windows before going ahead to install ubuntu
[01:47] <sindrum> is there anyway to refresh my Desktop directory, i already tried rebooting, maybe this will get rid of the files?
[01:47] <ike_> Anyone know why fsck tells me I need to --rebuid-tree every boot despite the fact that I have --rebuilt all my partitions?
[01:47] <un_operateur1> and the way the partitions are laid out i think splitting D: is going to be quite tricky
[01:48] <gaurav19> Thats what I thought of doing with partition magic, just wanted to discuss with experts here as I was not too sure..
[01:48] <PriceChild> ScreaminIke: I saw this on the forums.... it installs an internet filter... which the creater doesn't quite know how to remove cleanly
[01:48] <clemyeats> gaurav19: anyhow, you can run the live CD without installing anything, and have a look at the partitioning tool in there to see if you recognize your partitions and learn their name in Linux
[01:48] <mikebot> so, when i tried to follow that pppoe walkthrough, i got an error when i did the command 'sudo pppoeconf'
[01:48] <Okt> Is there an easy way to get all of the desktop icons to be the same size?
[01:48] <Wiltre> I really could use some help.  I'm trying to install ubuntu on my machine (Currently on windows part) but the installer wont go.  I got live CD for 6.10 X86 computers.  Here's my problem, it will freeze when the orange bar fills.  So, I set up to go at 1024 and 32 bit.  It passed it to show me an error screen about XServer.  I know my comp can't run XServers, In GParted I need to use "Xvesa" or something that's a m
[01:48] <Wiltre> ini xserver.  Is it still possible for me to install 6.10???
[01:48] <ScreaminIke> PriceChild, that's priceless. so now, what?
[01:49] <un_operateur1> if it were me -- i'd try partitioning D: within Windows's Disk management utility
[01:49] <MeneK> Hi everybody. I just broke my fonts testing kubuntu-desktop. Now they look too much bold and blurry... What can I do? Thanks!
[01:49] <mikebot> when i did 'pppoeconf' and it tried to do something after i clicked 'yes' ig ot an error which read: 'Sorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access COntroller of your provoder did not respond...'
[01:49] <PriceChild> ScreaminIke: I never saw a solution... the guy just reccomended a reinstall sorry :(
[01:49] <PriceChild> ScreaminIke: you could do a quick search of the Ubuntu CE forums?
[01:49] <gaurav19> Sure clemyeats, thanks for that.
[01:50] <clemyeats> gaurav19: you're welcome :)
[01:50] <ScreaminIke> that's fantastic. cuz i already started (over dialup) to download the Ubuntu CE iso
[01:50] <mikebot> anyone know how to get dsl working on ubuntu?
[01:50] <Wiltre> I really could use some help.  I'm trying to install ubuntu on my machine (Currently on windows part) but the installer wont go.  I got live CD for 6.10 X86 computers.  Here's my problem, it will freeze when the orange bar fills.  So, I set up to go at 1024 and 32 bit.  It passed it to show me an error screen about XServer.  I know my comp can't run XServers, In GParted I need to use "Xvesa" or something that's a m
[01:50] <Wiltre> ini Xserver.  Can I install Ubuntu without Xserver using a mini version or something? I have an ati x700 card.
[01:50] <gaurav19> I just found this: http://www.hevnikov.com/blog/2006/11/13/triple-boot-xp-vista-ubuntu-with-single-boot-screen/
[01:50] <ScreaminIke> i'll see if i can haxor- 31337 browse them
[01:51] <gaurav19> That seems quite comprehensive. I believe you guys would have seen this before. Is this good ?
[01:51] <MeneK> ( you can see how my fonts look now at: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=320125 )
[01:52] <sindrum> ok iv figured out what to do to get that directory to delete... sudo rm -r (filename)
[01:52] <MeneK> hey Wiltre
[01:52] <MeneK> i have also an Ati X700 card
[01:52] <elaine_> Is it possible to convert server into desktop?  It's working as a desktop, ubuntu-desktop and all but, when I upgraded to 6.10 it installed the server kernel automatically
[01:52] <Wiltre> MeneK: And it ran fine?
[01:52] <MeneK> I don't now if you have the same prob
[01:53] <Curs0r> hehehe more beryl fiending http://123pichosting.com/images/2614Screenshot-4.png
[01:53] <MeneK> but to start X you must change the driver in xorg.conf
[01:53] <mikebot> actually, if anyone can tell me how tog et my hauppauge card working in ubuntu, that would be great
[01:53] <MeneK> try changing "ati" to "radeo"
[01:53] <MeneK> "radeon" sorry
[01:53] <mikebot> OK, well, I guess I'llt ry back later. Bye all.
[01:54] <Wiltre> MeneK: Where is this .conf? I'm on windows right now since hte live wont even run
[01:54] <LjL> MeneK: i can't look at the screenshot because it requires an account. however, you might want to try going (in KDE) to System Settings / Appearance / Fonts / Anti-aliasing and set Hinting to Full
[01:54] <sindrum> elaine_: nice desktop how does it run?
[01:54] <fokuslee> ? wiltre did u dpkg-reconfigure xserver.xorg?
[01:54] <elaine_> sindrum, it runs fine.
[01:54] <sindrum> sorry i ment curs0r...
[01:55] <Wiltre> fokuslee: Where! My computer wont run at all.  When I do the ubuntu live CD it just hangs and gives me an XServer error
[01:55] <elaine_> sindrum, it's just a pain that I have to manually install a new kernel if I upgrade
[01:55] <siloe> Helllo!!!  Make cfdisk create hda6 and hda7 after mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda6 "error  not have hda6"
[01:55] <elaine_> sindrum, because I used ubuntu server cd at the start
[01:55] <MeneK> the Xorg conf file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:55] <Curs0r> sindrum, it's smooth as glass
[01:55] <Wiltre> How can I change it if my livecd wont even go?
[01:55] <eegore> Could someone help me figure out why I cannot control the sound level of different apps even though I am running alsa
[01:56] <eegore> I am running dapper
[01:56] <MeneK> wiltre: get to a tty , presing ctrl+alt+F2
[01:56] <MeneK> then type sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:56] <Wiltre> So CTRL+ALT+F2 at boot screen... then edit my xorg.conf
[01:56] <raavi> what apps are those
[01:57] <raavi> eegore: what apps are those
[01:57] <MeneK> wiltre: just after getting the X error
[01:57] <MeneK> look for the "Device" section
[01:57] <Wiltre> MeneK Alright; going.

[01:57] <eegore> raavi: xmms, teamspeak, Skype, and UT2004

[01:58] <MeneK> ok! thanks!
[01:59] <Faar> Where could I find the log for what happens after Grub stars the system? (I get some "PCI error..")?
[01:59] <jpjacobs> Faar, dmesg?
[02:00] <jpjacobs> or /var/log/...
[02:00] <MeneK> <Wiltre: The  device section should look like this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37478/
[02:00] <Faar> jpjacobs : I'l have a look
[02:00] <jpjacobs> try grep -ir "PCI error" /var/log/*
[02:01] <brohken> ryanakca, a laptop
[02:01] <MeneK> Ljl: I have unistalled kubuntu-desktop.
[02:01] <fokuslee> damn neighbor stealing my internet again
[02:02] <ryanakca> brohken: I'd go for ASUS... if not them, then Toshiba...
=== eneried is now known as faeryNatsuki
[02:02] <ryanakca> brohken: stay away from Dell & HP though... (if you don't want to waste money on windows)
[02:02] <jpjacobs> brohken, i've got an older toshiba laptop here, and i'm very happy with it :)
[02:02] <mon^rch> whats the name of the KDE IRC client again?
[02:03] <fokuslee> kubuntu
[02:03] <Shadow_mil> how can I install KDE?
[02:03] <Fleebailey33> konversation
[02:03] <mon^rch> ty
[02:03] <jpjacobs> ryanakca, dell does sell without windows... after some pushing
[02:03] <shorty114> ryanakca, can't you get your money back on the XP?
[02:03] <Fleebailey33> apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[02:03] <dynamo> mon^rch, Konversation
[02:03] <Shadow_mil> Fleebailey33: that messes up a lot of things like my boot splash
[02:03] <brohken> ryanakca, the reason I am even considering it is because of this deal: http://www.gotapex.com/
[02:03] <brohken> its soo cheap
[02:04] <angel12> hey guys, ive got what seems to be a major network problem. whenever i try to apt-get something, i get a cannot find archive.ubuntu.com, but when i ping it, its there, and then apt-get works. then whenever i try to connect to irc in xchat, i have to ping irc.freenode.net first, otherwise it sees irc.freenode.net as 1.0.0.0
[02:04] <brohken> and spec wise it's pretty nice
[02:04] <dynamo> Shadow_mil, you can put your bootsplash back
[02:04] <fokuslee> angel12 u have dns problem
[02:04] <Shadow_mil> dynamo: how?
[02:04] <ryanakca> jpjacobs: they do? I tried getting it without windows but they said I couldn't...
[02:04] <angel12> fokuslee, any idea how to fix it? i figured thats what it was
[02:05] <fokuslee> echo "nameserver wuteveruhave" >> /etc/resolv.conf
[02:05] <jpjacobs> ryanakca, i heard some people who had it done...
[02:05] <dynamo> Shadow_mil, hang on
[02:05] <fokuslee> angel12 if ur on router is probably the same as ur router gateway
[02:05] <angel12> fokuslee, so i just put my router ip in quotes?
[02:05] <fokuslee> yeah
[02:06] <Shadow_mil> I think it also messes up my login screen
[02:06] <fokuslee> just replace wuteveruhave with router ip
[02:06] <evil_> How do I get access to /var/lib/tor?
[02:06] <ryanakca> jpjacobs: hmm...
[02:06] <angel12> fokuslee, just tried it with sudo and i get a permission denied
[02:06] <pantera> hi
[02:07] <fokuslee> interesting can u nano or vi it?
[02:07] <fokuslee> and see wut it has?
[02:07] <dynamo> Shadow_mil, $sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
[02:07] <Shadow_mil> dynamo: thanks
[02:07] <dynamo> yw
[02:07] <evil_> How do I get access to /var/lib/tor?
[02:08] <dynamo> evil_, with sudo?
[02:08] <MeneK> Shadow_mil: be aware!
[02:08] <angel12> fokuslee, yeah, there was the ip for my router and some random ip that i have never seen before in there for nameserver
[02:08] <fokuslee> angel12 well thats ur problem change it back
[02:08] <fokuslee> can u?
[02:08] <evil_> dynamo, anyway..It sys I dont have the neccesary permissions
[02:08] <fokuslee> im not too familair with ubuntu
[02:08] <fokuslee> sudo ?
[02:08] <MeneK> better user aptitude
[02:08] <fokuslee> i forgot how to get real root
[02:08] <dynamo> sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
[02:08] <fokuslee> u mite have to do ddat
[02:09] <dynamo> that's all
[02:09] <angel12> fokuslee, ok, i did, and now apt-get update is still lookin at 1.0.0.0
[02:09] <MeneK> Shadow_mil: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kde
[02:09] <dynamo> !tell fokuslee about sudo
[02:09] <Defend> omg hanovers suck
[02:10] <fokuslee> angel12 sorri i dono then
[02:10] <angel12> fokuslee, to get reall root you have to sudo passwd root, then put in the password
[02:10] <matju> if i use a KDE app with the GNOME desktop, how do i get to configure the global KDE settings (for my user) so that, e.g. the app doesn't use "system sounds" ?
[02:10] <angel12> fokuslee, well thanks tho
[02:10] <fokuslee> can u broswe webpage now?
[02:10] <Wiltre> ALright, didn't work at all.  I edited the xorg.conf;  But I had no idea what to do after
[02:10] <MeneK> you should restard gdm
[02:10] <camh> I've got a 6.06 i386 install with a custom built kernel. I've just got a Core 2 Duo which I was going to put in the same box. My plan was to rebuild the kernel for this Processor/MB - Will this work, or do I need a new 64bit userland?
[02:11] <angel12> fokuslee, yeah, i can browse all day and night, but connecting to irc and apt-get repo's gets hung up
[02:11] <fokuslee> grr aye good luck
[02:11] <usr_rob> I installed redhat artwork, the only thing that dont work is the blue pixmap on hover, any suggestions?
[02:11] <MeneK> Wiltre: try "sudo killall gdm" and later "sudo gdm"
[02:12] <fokuslee> Menek i think u want to use gdm stop
[02:12] <Wiltre> MeneK: So! Reboot, set vga to 1024 32, Get error, Push keycommand (I forget, I just pushed everything in the area), Edit the xorg.conf, sudo killall gdm then sudo gdm, then will the screen still be black?
[02:12] <pantera> hallo together, do someone know, howto become a background splash screen at console, without recompile the kernel or something like that? I use ubuntu edgy.
[02:12] <MeneK> fokuslee: yeah
[02:13] <fokuslee> Wiltre are u trying to use glx?
[02:13] <MeneK> Wiltre: that's what I did to get Ubuntu work with my x700, yes
[02:13] <fokuslee> i suggest u use vesa driver frist
[02:13] <fokuslee> get gui first
[02:13] <iain> What video card brand works best with Linux?
[02:13] <fokuslee> and follow tseilot guide on installing ati driver
[02:13] <Wiltre> NVidia
[02:14] <craigbass1976> I read the forums for a piece of accounting software similar to Quickbooks.  Gnucash is not it, but I found some reference to quasar, and a way to instal it with apt.  I can't get it to work though.
[02:14] <Ralith> iain, nvidia by far
[02:14] <craigbass1976> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=200563&page=2&highlight=accounting+software
[02:14] <Ralith> iain, if you don't mind closed-source drivers, at least
[02:14] <MeneK> Not ATI, for sure
[02:14] <Wiltre> fokuslee: How do I use Vesa??? I know it works since that's what I use on gparted
[02:14] <l3mr> iain: actually, intels work nice, but the cards are crap. between ati and nvidia, it's a no brainer. ati linux support sux
[02:14] <iain> Ralith: The games I play are closed-source, so I'm going to go ahead with it
[02:14] <Ralith> heh
[02:14] <Ralith> yeah
[02:14] <craigbass1976> how do you list the apps in a repo?
[02:14] <Ralith> nvidia's the best for gaming, period
[02:15] <Ralith> and intel /is/ pretty good if you don't need any performance whatsoever
[02:15] <Ralith> you get the most out of the card, and have oss drivers, but the most is very, very little :P
[02:15] <iain> That's too bad because I've got a best buy $50 card but BB doesn't sell low-end nVidia
[02:15] <Ralith> runs beryl at about 70fps, which is nice
[02:15] <craigbass1976> I remember trying to install ardour for an hour before I realized that I wanted ardour-gtk or something, and not just plain ardour
[02:15] <Gumby> considering that neither ATI or nVidia offer anything but proprietary drivers I fail to see how anyone can say that one is better than the other
[02:15] <MeneK> write "vesa" instead of "ati" or "radeon" in the Driver line of the device section of xorg.conf
[02:15] <Wiltre> hOW DO I USE VESA DRIVERS???
[02:15] <Wiltre> Caps
[02:15] <Wiltre> Menek: Alright.  I'll write vesa, then what
[02:15] <Wiltre> Menek: how do I get it to relaunch the disc
[02:15] <Ralith> iain, lemme take a look for you; assuming yer not broke, a little more should be fine
[02:15] <kapace> restart xorg?
[02:15] <Ralith> iain, agp or pcie?
[02:15] <pantera> bye
[02:16] <iain> Ralith: Hmm lemme check their site
[02:16] <l3mr> Gumby: ati's drivers are a pain in the ass to setup. nvidia's are closed source too, but a lot more userfriendly
[02:16] <iain> Oh bollocks, it's PCI
[02:16] <christy> hi im trying to help my dad though a ubuntu instal over the phone... he has windows on hda and wants ubuntu on hdb... the install after selecfting to install on hdb doesnt bring up anything about grub.. i want to make sure /dev/hda1 will be an option to boot his windows.. any help.. tough cause i cant see it :)
[02:16] <iain> That's probably not good.
[02:16] <Ralith> iain, you might even be able to afford one of the 7k series
[02:16] <Ralith> er
[02:16] <Ralith> you have a pci connector?
[02:16] <Gumby> l3mr: Ive never had an issue following the instructions for ATI.
[02:17] <Wiltre> MeneK: How do I reboot the disc with vesa still being in effect?
[02:17] <Ralith> I don't think you can find a PCI video card anywhere but an auction site :P
[02:17] <Ralith> or used computer place
[02:17] <MeneK> Wiltre: once xorg.conf is edited and saved, restart gdm. I used the "hard" way: killall & then gdm again
[02:17] <Ralith> or junk yard.
[02:17] <iain> Ralith: Of course, but I should probably get a better card
[02:17] <l3mr> Gumby: lucky you :)
[02:17] <Wiltre> Alright guys, brb trying this
[02:17] <iain> The fact it's PCI means it's quite old, right?
[02:17] <Ralith> yeah
[02:17] <Ralith> quite old
[02:18] <Ralith> have fun gaming on a machine like that :P
[02:18] <[sysex_ferrari] > found a bug in feisty, is there a bugtraq somewhere?
[02:18] <l3mr> iain: if it's plain pci, forget about getting a reasonable card for it. if it's pci-express, no problem
[02:18] <iain> Ralith: My machine is fine; my current card is a 7200
[02:18] <iain> So I'm looking to upgrade
[02:18] <Ralith> er
[02:18] <Ralith> then it's either AGP or PCIe
[02:18] <l3mr> iain: don't upgrade yet. wait till 8600 series is out
[02:18] <iain> Now I was going to buy it at Best Buy because I have a gift card, but I guess I won't do that.
[02:18] <Ralith> l3mr also has pretty good advice if you want good performance
[02:19] <iain> l3mr: 8600? That's an old card, isn't it?
[02:19] <kapace> if i installied python on ubuntu, where shouldi pu the shebang line to?
[02:19] <Ralith> the 8k series is really hardcore, and once the midrange models are out there, if you can afford them they'll be uber.
[02:19] <Ralith> iain, it's so new it doesn't exist yet >.<
[02:19] <[sysex_ferrari] > nevermind I'm retarded
[02:19] <l3mr> iain: no. 8xxx is the new nvidia architecture..
[02:19] <iain> l3mr: Oh, I was thinking ATI
[02:19] <Ralith> iain, I'm assuming you have a PCIe slot and don't realize it.
[02:19] <Soms> Arwen would like to know why he is banned, could an op message him; to stop him from asking in #wikipedia
[02:19] <iain> I have a Radeon 7200 ;-)
[02:20] <iain> Ralith: I have a PCIe slot, but I don't use it
[02:20] <Ralith> iain, why not?
[02:20] <l3mr> iain: i have to 8800 at uni, it's amazing but really expensive. soon, there will be a nvidia geforce 8600 or something, the same arch but mid-range priced. that's what you want. :)
[02:20] <iain> Ralith: Because my Radeon 7200 is PCI
[02:20] <ademan> what's a good hex editor for linux?
[02:20] <Ralith> ah.
[02:20] <Ralith> ademan, gui or console?
[02:20] <kapace> where does python bin in ubuntu?
[02:20] <iain> l3mr: Mid-range ~= $50?
[02:20] <Ralith> iain, that's low end :P
[02:20] <ademan> Ralith: GUI preferably but either will do
[02:20] <l3mr> ultra low end :/
[02:20] <iain> Ralith: Yeah, low-end is for me then
[02:20] <Ralith> iain, but it'll be a while before they come out anyway
[02:20] <Ralith> ademan, kde ok?
[02:21] <iain> You say low-end but it will run Doom 3 won't it?
[02:21] <ademan> Ralith: sure
[02:21] <Ralith> iain, doom 3 is old.
[02:21] <Ralith> ademan, khexedit :P
[02:21] <l3mr> iain: for gaming, you will need a card in the 200+ $ range
[02:21] <Ralith> apt-cache search hexedit for alternatives
[02:21] <Ralith> l3mr's right, if you want to run newish games
[02:21] <iain> I ran UT2k3 on my 7200 :P
[02:22] <l3mr> yeah but it's ancient :)
[02:22] <kapace> can these games work on ubuntu?
[02:22] <iain> I'm sure I can run UT2k7 on an X300, right?
[02:22] <Ralith> kapace, yeah
[02:22] <kapace> really!
[02:22] <l3mr> iain: not really.
[02:22] <kapace> i though all gmaes were made for windoze
[02:22] <Ralith> kapace, the doom, quake, and unreal tournament series all have linux support
[02:22] <iain> l3mr: how about a 9800?
[02:22] <kapace> nice
[02:22] <Ralith> iain, that's way worse :P
[02:23] <l3mr> iain: ut2k7 is not even out yet, i think it'll be dx10...
[02:23] <Ralith> 9800s are HORRENDOUS
[02:23] <Ralith> kapace, some others do too, like NWN
[02:23] <Ralith> at least, NWN1 did
[02:23] <Ralith> iain, go nvidia if yer upgrading
[02:23] <Ralith> you don't want to deal with ATI
[02:23] <Ralith> trust me
[02:23] <iain> Ralith: My friend runs UT2k4 at 1600x1200 with all quality settings enabled on a 9800Pro and it looks and runs great
[02:23] <Sublimal-> No, ati will just get u in to trubble
[02:23] <Ralith> iain, yeah, it's great until it starts crashing
[02:23] <l3mr> iain: yeah but ut2k4 is 2 years old. ancient :)
[02:24] <Sublimal-> Hi, every1
[02:24] <MeneK> ati is really a pain
[02:24] <Sublimal-> i got a huge problem
[02:24] <Erb> Hi, how do I open GVim? I installed it but it didn't appear in the Applications menu (I am obviously new to Linux).
[02:24] <Ralith> iain, mine died in about a month; I have a friend who ran through 3 of them before he stopped asking for replacements.
[02:24] <iain> l3mr: If a 9800Pro can run UT2k4, I thought an X300 would handle UT2k7
[02:24] <Ralith> Erb, if it's really not in the menu, hit alt-f2 and enter 'gvim' and hit return
[02:24] <Ralith> iain, you do not want an ATI card
[02:24] <Ralith> got it?
[02:25] <Gumby> iain: honestly, if you can read instructions there is nothing wrong with ATI.  you have to jump through a few hoops to get either driver installed as they are both closed source.  saying one is easier/better than the other is nonsense
[02:25] <Ralith> iain, their drivers are slow, update slowly, rarely support the latest X, unstable....
[02:25] <l3mr> iain: ut2k7 will probably only run well on the newt ati generation. and x300 is a low-end model, which means  even play current games will be slow
[02:25] <iain> I'm just making an analogy; I meant to demonstrate that a $50 card can run modern games
[02:25] <Sublimal-> My quake 3 wount go fullscreen, its just a big black border around quake 3, i have edited the xorg.conf and added more modelines, but i doesnt work
[02:25] <Ralith> Gumby, not true.
[02:25] <Sublimal-> anyone ?
[02:25] <Gumby> Ralith: its completely true.
[02:25] <Ralith> Gumby, ATI's support for OpenGL (the only option on Linux) is crappy
[02:25] <l3mr> iain: well depends on your definition of modern :)
[02:25] <Ralith> Gumby, look at any performance comparison; ATI always does better on directx games, nvidia on opengl
[02:25] <Ralith> whatever the OS.
[02:25] <Nippoo> hm, I've been asked to program a piece of database software for a company (to manage clients, make bookings, get payments, etc...) what language should I use? (a bit like Heritage, the library cataloguing software, y'know?)
[02:25] <deep`> !system-tools-backends
[02:25] <iain> l3mr: UT2k7 is on my list
[02:26] <ubotu> system-tools-backends: System Tools to manage computer configuration -- scripts. In component main, is optional. Version 1.9.7-0ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 151 kB, installed size 692 kB
[02:26] <Ralith> and nvidia actually has thorough support of their linux drivers, too
[02:26] <Ralith> iain, for that you need an expensive card.
[02:26] <Megaqwerty> I've followed the guides from ubuntu, but I still can't watch/listen to streaming video/audio
[02:26] <iain> Ralith: Damn ;-)
[02:26] <craigbass1976> Ok, I give up on quasar.  Anyone ever used sql-ledger?
[02:26] <Ralith> Gumby, ATI, for example, tends to lag quite a ways behind Xorg releases, whereas you can rely on nvidia being up to date.
[02:26] <Sublimal-> My quake 3 wount go fullscreen, its just a big black border around quake 3, i have edited the xorg.conf and added more modelines, but i doesnt work, i could realy nead som help, anyone ?
[02:26] <MeneK> how I get AIGLX to work with ATi? I think Xgl is the only option
[02:26] <Megaqwerty> Can anyone help me figure out what is wrong?
[02:26] <Sublimal-> please, help
[02:26] <Erb> Ralith, thanks, that worked, however, is there a way so that GVim can be included as a shortcut?
[02:26] <Ralith> Erb, gnome?
[02:27] <l3mr> Ralith: well, both suck, but nvidia does so less
[02:27] <Erb> Yes
[02:27] <Ralith> l3mr, ehh, is nvidia actually bad?
[02:27] <iain> Both suck?  Well don't hold your breath for a card that doesn't
[02:27] <Ralith> l3mr, I was under the impression that their stuff was up to scratch, except for the closedness
[02:27] <illusina> I think a recent update broke my sound sound, as when I look at my system tray it appears I have no sounds cards.
[02:27] <Ralith> iain, it's the drivers, not the cards
[02:27] <Sublimal-> ...
[02:27] <l3mr> Ralith: well, encrypted drivers suck.
[02:27] <Gumby> Ralith: in the range of card that iain is talking about its not going to make a damn of difference
[02:27] <Ralith> l3mr, ah.
[02:27] <illusina> dmesg gives me messages like: snd_emu10k1: Unknown symbol snd_rawmidi_receive
[02:28] <Megaqwerty> I've followed the guides from ubuntu, but I still can't watch/listen to streaming video/audio'
[02:28] <Ralith> Gumby, it most certainly will.
[02:28] <Ralith> Gumby, for example, if he gets a 9800, it'll die on him right off
[02:28] <Ralith> Gumby, and he'll have display problems every time X updates
[02:28] <Sublimal-> please, i have tried everything
[02:28] <haggard> i need help: when I try to update my sources.list file, it says "E: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/htp could not be found."
[02:28] <Gumby> a radeon 9800 for $50?
[02:29] <Ralith> Gumby, they're worth less than that.
[02:29] <l3mr> Sublimal-: do you have the resolution quake wants in xorg.conf?
[02:29] <Gumby> Ralith: Ive upgraded X multiple times in ubuntu and I havnt had a single problem
[02:29] <Ralith> Gumby, you must upgrade very slowly, or never use anything not in the official LTS repos.
[02:29] <Sublimal-> l3mr: yes, i have
[02:29] <ScreaminIke> so... basically, i'm dling the ubuntu ce cd. cuz they pwnt my system.
[02:29] <kapace> if my friend did apt-get install python
[02:30] <kapace> where is teh python bin?
[02:30] <Sublimal-> it works just fine in mandriva, arch, gentoo.. but in ubuntu it just doesnt
[02:30] <l3mr> Sublimal-: do you get any error message from the game?
[02:30] <ScreaminIke> btw, what's the irc equivalent of the sounder list?
[02:30] <Sublimal-> no
[02:30] <Sublimal-> i seems to work fine
[02:30] <prower> Hello :> Anyone here using beryl and edgy together with positive results?
[02:30] <Virtuall> prower, yes
[02:30] <Sublimal-> it just wont get fullscreen
[02:30] <ScreaminIke> what is beryl?
[02:30] <Sublimal-> i get a huge black border
[02:31] <Sublimal-> and the game moves to the left corner of the screen
[02:31] <Gumby> lmao @ ralith.  lets see, upgrade slowly...  hrm, nope.. running feisty.  anything not in the official repos.. wrong again.
[02:31] <Virtuall> ScreaminIke, www.beryl-project.org
[02:31] <l3mr> Sublimal-: if it's the same version of X, try backup up your xorg.conf and use one of the working systems
[02:31] <l3mr> Sublimal-: maybe that helps
[02:31] <prower> Virtuall: Cool...not too bad stability-wise then
[02:31] <Sublimal-> u think ?
[02:31] <Sublimal-> but, i got the same modelines
[02:31] <l3mr> Sublimal-: and make sure you use the same driver version
[02:31] <Sublimal-> the same driver
[02:32] <Megaqwerty> can someone help me with getting streaming video to play?
[02:32] <Virtuall> prower, well it does have some problems... i'd actually say it's pretty unusable, but it works
[02:32] <craigbass1976> Hey, I've got apache installed but there's no httpd in /etc/init.d to start, stop, or restart.  Is it somewhere else?
[02:32] <Gumby> you cant even get a decent radeon 9800 on ebay for $50.  /me wonders what he is talking about
[02:32] <l3mr> Sublimal-: well there must be a difference somewhere, and switching the xorg.conf takes 3 mins, and maybe helps :)
[02:32] <Sublimal-> yes, the problem is, i dont have a xorg.conf from an earlier system :(
[02:32] <Megaqwerty> craigbass1976: try doing "locate init.d" in bash
[02:32] <prower> Virtuall: Oh...well that's kind of the opposite of what you said first ;>
[02:33] <deep`> what is "system-tools-backends"? Is there any app needing this? what happends if i kill it?
[02:33] <l3mr> Sublimal-: what card?
[02:33] <Sublimal-> i945
[02:33] <Sublimal-> intel
[02:33] <l3mr> hmm
[02:33] <Sublimal-> i got a laptop
[02:33] <Sublimal-> widescreen
[02:33] <Sublimal-> 1280x800
[02:33] <Megaqwerty>  can someone help me with getting streaming video to play?
[02:33] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: witch player do u use ?
[02:33] <Virtuall> prower, the results *are* positive. by positive you don't mean perfect, do you?
[02:33] <l3mr> Sublimal-: but it does use direct rendering?
[02:34] <Sublimal-> yes
[02:34] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: I'd like to use gxine, but anyone would work
[02:34] <Sublimal-> i works just fine
[02:34] <craigbass1976> Megaqwerty, init.d is in /etc, but there's not httpd in there.  Isn't apache the http daemon?  I'm looking for the httpd file.
[02:34] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: u got the right codecs ?
[02:34] <l3mr> Sublimal-: other opengl apps work fine?
[02:34] <Sublimal-> l3mr: no, the same problem there
[02:34] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: I used https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#oneline
[02:34] <nightless> hello where is sources.list again?  and does anyone have a repository that has the new wine in it?
[02:34] <Megaqwerty> so they should be installed
[02:35] <prower> Virtuall: Well, positive for me would be working and not crashing, I guess ;>
[02:35] <Sublimal-> have u tried mplayer ? our vlc ?
[02:35] <Megaqwerty> craigbass1976: I don't know really anything about the Ubuntu server. I just knew a bash command to help you find files. Sorry.
[02:35] <l3mr> Sublimal-: hmm sorry, no idea :/. dpkg-reconfigure the xserver, other than that...:/
[02:35] <[sysex_ferrari] > anyone know when restricted-modules are coming for 2.6.20?
[02:35] <Sublimal-> ok :/
[02:35] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: I have all of those installed
[02:36] <haggard> when I try to update my sources.list file, it says "E: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/htp could not be found." Any ideas?
[02:36] <Sublimal-> crap, i realy like ubuntu, but if i cant get this to work, i just cant use it
[02:36] <bshaw> anyone on here know why LVM packages dont work with Edgy??
[02:36] <LjL> haggard: you have a line that says "htp:" instead of "http:"
[02:36] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: you help me, I'll try to help you
[02:36] <Sublimal-> ;)
[02:36] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: what's your problem?
[02:36] <Virtuall> prower, it doesn't crash... usually... it does however sometimes render windows all black but reloading it via tray menu helps. and it does also crash when launching opengl app, but i'm sure it's not ubuntu-related
[02:36] <haggard> LjL: I know
[02:36] <haggard> LjL: what can I do about it
[02:36] <Sublimal-> i cant get quake 3 in fullscreen, i only get a black border
[02:37] <LjL> haggard: ... change it to say http:?
[02:37] <Megaqwerty> hmm....
[02:37] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: do you have edgy?
[02:37] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: yes
[02:37] <Sublimal-> i doo
[02:37] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: ok...so having opengl shouldn't be the problem...
[02:37] <haggard> LjL: it does sasy http
[02:37] <haggard> say*
[02:37] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: What graphics card do you have?
[02:37] <LjL> haggard: pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:38] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: I just need the manufacturer
[02:38] <Sublimal-> i945
[02:38] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: that's the name of the brand that makes your card?
[02:38] <craigbass1976> Megaqwerty, Doh!  the apache service is, oddly enough, called apache.
[02:38] <Sublimal-> Intel i945
[02:39] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: what format does the file have ?
[02:39] <Megaqwerty> @CRAIG: lol
[02:39] <Erb> how do i see a list of the users in a channel in xchat? it only shows the main window
[02:39] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: any format really, .wmv, .mov, .ogg, you name it, I can't stream it
[02:39] <nightless_> anywhere here use wine?
[02:39] <Sublimal-> not anything ?
[02:39] <haggard> LjL: http://code.bulix.org/23zjqp-26340?raw
[02:39] <Sublimal-> no music ?
[02:39] <Sublimal-> no movies ?
[02:40] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: Intel makes graphics cards ?
[02:40] <Sublimal-> yes, they do =)
[02:40] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: nothing streaming
[02:40] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: If the file is on my computer I can play it fine
[02:40] <StyXman> hi all. I have my system setup with the en_US.utf-8 locale, but I need to run an app under the en_US.iso-8859-1 locale. I know about setting the LANG envvar, but the problem is that I don't seem to have this locale and I don't know how to generate it. jfy, this is a dapper. any hints?
[02:40] <Sublimal-> hm, wierd
[02:40] <LjL> haggard: line 18. it says "deb-src htp://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe multiverse"
[02:40] <Sublimal-> i look in to it, google a bit
[02:41] <haggard> LjL: ah, so it does. Totally missed it. Thanks!
[02:41] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: I'll do the same for your problem. My fix idea was for a nVIDIA graphics card.
[02:41] <LjL> haggard: besides, you really should add -updates and -security for universe and multiverse.
[02:41] <Megaqwerty> (i.e. dling the Beta Drivers)
[02:41] <StyXman> Megaqwerty: intel makes video chips, and embeds them in their chipsets which you can only find in intel mother boards
[02:42] <haggard> LjL: Yeah, I know. I just did a fresh install of ubuntu
[02:42] <Firebird> maybe you need to increase the width of the list Erb? (could be 0)... it's displayed on the right by default, see if it's there and drag it open if it is :)
[02:42] <LjL> haggard: ok
[02:42] <Megaqwerty> so I see
[02:42] <Stormx2> Yo. I tried to hibernate. Instead my PC just shut down. Now, when I boot, swap fails to initialize, and later is says it can't find the swap-space signiture. I'm under the impression that my swap space has therefore failed to load up. Any suggestions?
[02:42] <StyXman> the word has it that they have nice free-as-in-speech xorg 3d support
[02:43] <mortus>  #urban_exploration
[02:43] <Sublimal-> StyXman: yes, it works realy nice
[02:43] <StyXman> spam?
[02:43] <Erb> Firebird, I have the window maximized, there must be a way to show/hide?
[02:44] <StyXman> Erb: maximized or fullscreen?
[02:44] <iain> l3mr: You seem to think certain cards will break or crash.  Do you recommend any budget cards?
[02:44] <Sublimal-> StyXman: fullscreen, i get a black huge border
[02:44] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: did you get this: http://www.amazon.com/Quake-3-Arena-Linux/dp/B000046Q56 ?
[02:44] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: yes =)
[02:45] <buddhalover> hello world
[02:45] <Sublimal-> ehm
[02:45] <Sublimal-> no
[02:45] <l3mr> iain: no i don't think cards will..crash or break. it's just that driver-wise, i feel that nvidia is less of a hassle. but once everything is set up, ati will do as well as nvidia
[02:45] <Sublimal-> but i run the linux version
[02:45] <Erb> Actually, there is a users list in the bottom left corner, when i click it, it shows users. I wonder how I can get it to pin down
[02:45] <iain> l3mr: Oh, sorry, that must have been Ralith who said something about crashing.
[02:45] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: then I can say mwahahahahaa! Mainly because you can actually complain directly to the manufacturer and they will fix it.
[02:45] <Grand_Nagus> i just installed my pixmap engine and when i invoke gedit in terminal i still get a Gtk-error module-path for pixmap not found HELP!!
[02:45] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: they kinda have to.
[02:45] <Vessquire> Does anyone know how to share files and have the shares advertised on the local network though zeroconf/avahi/bonjour
[02:46] <l3mr> iain: the problem is more that in my opinion the low end cards are not worth buying. better buy a last-generation mid-range card second hand...
[02:46] <Sublimal-> but Megaqwerty , it works fine in suse, gentoo, arch mandriva, pclinuxos osv
[02:46] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: you've tried it?
[02:46] <Sublimal-> complain ?
[02:46] <StyXman> Vessquire: it's supposed to be automatic, but I never tried it
[02:46] <malt1> do i need to port forward port 25 for postfix to work to send a email?
[02:46] <iain> l3mr: Is there a budget card (or last gen mid range card) that won't go obsolete so fast I'll buy a new one in six months?
[02:46] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: I mean contact their technical support.
[02:47] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: ;) i think the problem is in ubuntu
[02:47] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: how did you install it?
[02:47] <StyXman> malt1: what are you trying to accomplish?
[02:47] <Sublimal-> i got the linux binary installer
[02:47] <malt1> StyXman phpbb and phpnuke site
[02:47] <Sublimal-> and installed it
[02:47] <malt1> email confirm
[02:47] <Vessquire> Styxman... I'm looking for the configuration I need to make in avahi to advertise the shares... or the sharing program (gshare, samba, etc.) that will register itself with avahi so that shares will be advertised
[02:47] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: what was the file extention? .deb?
[02:48] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: no, .run
[02:48] <l3mr> iain: the problem is that just about 3 weeks ago the first next-gen graphics card was released by nvidia. ati will release the new high-end model too, soon. but the only card good enough in 6 month is of this generation. better wait a bit ..
[02:48] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: wow, never seen that before.
[02:48] <Sublimal-> ;)
[02:48] <iain> l3mr: I guess I have bad timing.  I was waiting a bit to replace my 7200.
[02:48] <Sublimal-> maybe, its Xrandr that is fucked up
[02:49] <l3mr> iain: but if all the games you want to play are 1 or 2 years old, current cards will do fine. new games however...
[02:49] <StyXman> malt1: and your web server is behind a firewall?
[02:49] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: have you tried it on another distro on the same computer? Your graphics card may be the problem, not Ubuntu.
[02:49] <malt1> router
[02:49] <malt1> yep
[02:49] <malt1> www.m4lt.com
[02:49] <gnomefreak> Sublimal-: please watch your language
[02:49] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: (i.e. not meeting the requirements)
[02:49] <malt1> does mail service need port 25?
[02:49] <StyXman> malt1: and who's the mail exchange for your domain?
[02:49] <Sublimal-> gnomefreak: sry
[02:49] <l3mr> Sublimal-: i had an intel chip in my old laptop too, and 3d worked fine...
[02:49] <StyXman> malt1: it depends of direction
[02:49] <Sublimal-> yes
[02:49] <Sublimal-> 3d works fine
[02:49] <malt1> StyXman: i just need it to send email confim with phpbb and php nuke site
[02:50] <l3mr> Sublimal-: i mean, fine without the problems you describe.
[02:50] <StyXman> malt1: well, I think that means mails going out and replies going in
[02:50] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: ive tried another distros, and it works fine their
[02:50] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: try running glxgears
[02:50] <Megaqwerty> oh
[02:50] <iain> l3mr: Well I just played Nexuiz on a friend's PC and yes I'd like to play that.  It's kinda old I guess.  I might also get UT2k7.  I'm not a serious gamer, though, so I'd rather spend $200 on other PC components than a video card.
[02:50] <Megaqwerty> mkay...but try "glxgears" anyway.
[02:50] <StyXman> Vessquire: sorry, I have no clue
[02:50] <Sublimal-> it works fine
[02:50] <Sublimal-> the game starts
[02:50] <Megaqwerty> oh
[02:50] <Sublimal-> but it is not in fullscreen
[02:50] <Megaqwerty> so then what's your problem?
[02:51] <Megaqwerty> oh
[02:51] <StyXman> Sublimal-: tou said you get a black border?
[02:51] <Megaqwerty> ok. so do you see your desktop background with some black bars around it?'
[02:51] <Sublimal-> it is a big black border around the game, and it looks like it cant switch to 640x480 in fullscreen
[02:51] <Reilithion> Okay, I'm ssh'd into another computer on my network.  Can I start a graphical program on there and have it display on the computer I'm on now?
[02:51] <Reilithion> I seem to remember a $DISPLAY environment variable or something.
[02:51] <StyXman> Reilithion: logout and ssh -X
[02:52] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: can you take a screenshot?
[02:52] <StyXman> if your server has xforwarding on, you can run remote x apps seamlessly
[02:52] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: wait
[02:52] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: I can't really picture what it looks like
[02:52] <Sublimal-> ill try
[02:52] <l3mr> iain: i doubt ut2k7 will run well on current cards ( except gf8800 ), but since it's not out yet, this is just speculation
[02:52] <Megaqwerty> k
[02:52] <Megaqwerty> Sublimal-: then upload it here: http://imageshack.us/
[02:52] <iain> l3mr: Well OK I'll scratch it from my list.
[02:53] <Reilithion> StyXman: cool.  thanks
[02:53] <l3mr> Reilithion: you need to allow X-forward in your sshd config
[02:53] <iain> l3mr: For current games, how would a GF 7600 perform?  It's not the latest, but it has a nice price on Amazon.
[02:54] <StyXman> Reilithion: you can add the -C option for compression in reliable links
[02:54] <kishan> hi can any one help my azerus crashes when i open it
[02:54] <l3mr> iain: yeah the -600 series are usually the best price/performance ratio
[02:54] <nightless_> im trying to do sudo apt-get build-dep wine, but i get E: Could not open file /var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_universe_source_Sources - open (2 No such file or directory)    ? :(
[02:54] <Firebird> I have the same problem kishan :(. Do you use edgy?
[02:55] <kishan> yes firebird
[02:55] <l3mr> iain: [4567] 200 and so are crap, and [4567] 800 expensive
[02:55] <l3mr> :)
[02:55] <iain> l3mr: Thank you for your advice.  You have made me realize how little I know about games and their relation to hardware.
[02:55] <Firebird> you see it for a few seconds then it closes without an error message?
[02:55] <kishan> Firebird: yes same problem
[02:55] <Firebird> :s
[02:55] <m12> How can I remove the Totem mozilla extension without removing ubuntu-desktop (which synaptics wants to do?).   i want to use VLC for mozilla, but it won't do it because the Totem plugin is installed
[02:55] <Sublimal-> Megaqwerty: http://imageshack.us/
[02:55] <Sublimal-> whatta
[02:55] <StyXman> nightless_: add deb-src lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list, aptitude update, and then try again
[02:56] <l3mr> iain: yw :)

[03:03] <Ffwater> ??
[03:03] <ubotu> gnomebaker: application for CD/DVD creation in the GNOME desktop. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.6.0-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 991 kB, installed size 2964 kB
[03:03] <Firebird> lol, genomebaker
[03:03] <malt1> what is a simple mail server i could use, I just need something simple that will send out emails on php nuke sites for email confirm
[03:04] <Ffwater> My permissions are screwed.
[03:04] <john__> i'm looking some stuff up on the net
[03:04] <john__> i didn't know anything about gksudo
[03:04] <Ffwater> I want to use the copy drag over method.
[03:05] <LjL> Ffwater, unless GNOME implements some heavy magic, i don't think that's the way a CD writer works...
[03:05] <christy> hi does anyone know the default ip address for a verizon dsl modem?
[03:05] <Ffwater> Seriously wow
[03:05] <christy> the dlink wireless that is hooked up has 192.168.0.1
[03:06] <Ffwater> What other then GNOME does that?
[03:06] <LjL> Ffwater: if what you have in mind is to take a file, move it into the CD folder, and have it written to the CD right away, also with the possibility of repeating the operation... no, i don't think you can do that
[03:07] <Ffwater> Ok thank you
[03:07] <Ffwater> Does Unix do it?
[03:07] <Ffwater> =|
[03:07] <Firebird> christy, give 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.254 a try :)
[03:07] <ReWT_AxS> anyone wanna attempt to help me out with getting sound to work on these internal speakers?
[03:08] <christy> Firebird, nada :(
[03:08] <christy> i cant find it through the dlink ui either
[03:09] <Firebird> and nothing is mentioned in the manual? :s sorry I can't be of more help, I don't own one :)
[03:09] <dynamo> christy,  try 192.168.0.1 but first unplug that D)link router
[03:10] <ba5e> zzz im tired
[03:11] <Mojo_> I'm using edgy and the bootscreen is monochrome/greyscale and crashes on boot sometimes.
[03:11] <Mojo_> Anybody know what that's about?
[03:11] <dynamo> Mojo_, what screen and gpu do you have
[03:11] <un_operateur1> I do away with bootscreens -- don't really see a point to them except for cosmetic reasons
[03:12] <Mojo_> Nvidia with proprietary module
[03:12] <Mojo_> and Dell 24"
[03:13] <dynamo> Mojo_, do you have the same problem in Dapper?
[03:13] <usr_rob> Hi, if anyone has Bluecurve installed, please send me your /usr/share/themes/Bluecurve/gtk-2.0/gtkrc , mine is corrupt.
[03:13] <Mojo_> No
[03:13] <Mojo_> only in edgy
[03:13] <ReWT_AxS> how do i load sound drivers for edgy
[03:13] <ReWT_AxS> just the basic generic one
[03:13] <ReWT_AxS> kldload snd_driver
[03:13] <ReWT_AxS> ?
[03:13] <un_operateur1> Mojo_, what happens "it crashes" ? does it hang? do you get a dump?
[03:13] <Mojo_> Hang
[03:13] <Mojo_> No dump
[03:14] <phlite_kontrol> yo, any idea how i can disable my laptop lid switch?
[03:14] <Mojo_> it hangs after the ugly boot screen comes up, but the bar doesn't even fill up a bit
[03:15] <DragonRift> I was told to come here and ask about the space station
[03:15] <DragonRift> ;)
[03:15] <phlite_kontrol> lol
[03:15] <ReWT_AxS> phlite_kontrol, i do
[03:15] <Firebird> IIS? :D
[03:15] <Firebird> err ISS
[03:15] <DragonRift> yes
[03:15] <ReWT_AxS> don't shut it?
[03:15] <ReWT_AxS> :-P
[03:15] <phlite_kontrol> ReWT_AxS: FUNNY GUY!
[03:15] <ReWT_AxS> bwah haha
[03:15] <phlite_kontrol> heh
[03:15] <DragonRift> so fire some stories at me
[03:15] <ReWT_AxS> ^_^
[03:15] <DragonRift> I am curious
[03:15] <DragonRift> :D
[03:15] <un_operateur1> Mojo, you could try changing the boot screen to see if that helps
[03:15] <phlite_kontrol> now for some seriousness :) !
[03:15] <Firebird> lol
[03:15] <un_operateur1> or better, have no bootscreen at all
[03:15] <phlite_kontrol> any idears?
[03:15] <Mojo_> how do i do that?
[03:15] <Taunto> i am having problems installing ubuntu on my i386 system the install hangs at about 50-60% done any ideas

[03:18] <cchristianTPclon> I was here earlier
[03:18] <sunpengrui> too fast
[03:19] <CreativeEmbassy> I have a CD for Ubuntu 6.06... but last I heard, there were problems upgrading from one version to the latest (6.10)?
[03:19] <CreativeEmbassy> True?
[03:19] <cchristianTPclon> uuh
[03:19] <Uboon2> !system-tools-backend
[03:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about system-tools-backend - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:19] <sunpengrui> i can't read
[03:19] <cchristianTPclon> If anyone is listening, poke me
[03:19] <un_operateur1> CreativeEmbassy, there are always small problems when upgrading any system/OS/hardware etc
[03:19] <radar1976> hello
[03:19] <un_operateur1> its just a matter of resolving them if and when they do happen
[03:20] <lubix_> poke you wtf are you talking about
[03:20] <radar1976> having some troubles upgrading to edgy
[03:20] <CreativeEmbassy> Should I wait and download the entire new CD image? Or will Ubuntu 6.06 automatically upgrade me to the latest, if I let the upgrading software work its magic overnight?
[03:20] <cchristianTPclon> poke = #wikia speak - say name
[03:20] <cchristianTPclon> hallo
[03:20] <un_operateur1> CreativeEmbassy, you dont have to download a CD image to do a dist-upgrade
[03:20] <cchristianTPclon> I need some help with Ubuntu Desktop
[03:20] <foob> how did windows become more stable than linux... well i guess that's not fair, more stable than linux desktops
[03:21] <un_operateur1> all you really need is to update the sources.list and do a   aptitude dist-upgrade
[03:21] <foob> er that sounded trollish, i'd still rather use an unstable linux though
[03:21] <Gibbonz> hmm when ejecting an audio cd ubuntu/gnome tries to write to it for some reason
[03:21] <mistydawn> I think windows is just better at hiding its instability
[03:21] <mistydawn> newer versions anyway
[03:21] <un_operateur1> s/in//
[03:22] <chicken_Fire> Hello. Do I get a 3d desktop out of the box with ubuntu 6.10, or is it hard to make it run?
[03:22] <mistydawn> it's probably the simplest "out of the box" linux distro
[03:23] <bubuntu> Chicken u don't
[03:23] <un_operateur1> !beryl
[03:23] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl

[03:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about 3d - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:24] <CreativeEmbassy> So installing the 6.06 CD I have here would be fine, then I could do a distro upgrade from there? OK.
[03:24] <ReWT_AxS> someone help me figure otu this sound >.<
[03:24] <CreativeEmbassy> Now, I tried Ubuntu recently, and liked it except I couldn't run many of the programs I needed to.
[03:24] <CreativeEmbassy> Like the Adobe/Macromedia suites, I'm a designer.
[03:24] <Fleebailey33> when i get to fsck in boot it freezes
[03:25] <Fleebailey33> any idea's?
[03:25] <cchristianTPclon> ok
[03:25] <Fleebailey33> booth in feisty and in edgy
[03:25] <Fleebailey33> currently feisty
[03:25] <CreativeEmbassy> Someone mentioned VMware, that it could run XP inside of it, and it would work?
[03:25] <un_operateur1> CreativeEmbassy, sure
[03:25] <CreativeEmbassy> Someone enlighten me? I keep doing searches for vmware, and they're not very helpful/fruitful.
[03:25] <radar1976> where can I find the edgy upgrade from dapper.. I'm looking for the howto
[03:25] <CreativeEmbassy> Is vmware free?
[03:25] <bubuntu> Creative Embassy , its eat too much resources
[03:26] <Firebird> it's a bit slow but it runs :)
[03:26] <un_operateur1> !update
[03:26] <radar1976> CreativeEmbassy, the server and player are free
[03:26] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:26] <radar1976> I don
[03:26] <cchristianTPclon> I'm trying to install Ubuntu desktop 6.10, and I'm stuuck in a few places on the install
[03:26] <radar1976> I don't fine VMWare slow
[03:26] <un_operateur1> !anybody
[03:26] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:26] <Firebird> well, my pc is getting a bit older... probably doesn't help :)
[03:27] <radar1976> I have 2GB RAM and I have no problem running about 5 to 7 os's at the same time
[03:27] <Firebird> lol
[03:27] <buddhalover> i get i/o error when trying to edit resolv.conf why?
[03:27] <CreativeEmbassy> huh
[03:27] <un_operateur1> buddhalover, what editor are you using?
[03:27] <buddhalover> nano
[03:27] <un_operateur1> maybe you need permissions?
[03:28] <Firebird> buddhalover, you can't edit it as a normal user, try sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
[03:28] <buddhalover> firebird tried that. io error again
[03:28] <Firebird> hmmm
[03:28] <CreativeEmbassy> So I have a Pentium 4 and 2 gigs of ram, would running Adobe Creative Suite 2 be alright?
[03:28] <h0ndaracer2> hi
[03:28] <buddhalover> trying as root
[03:28] <cchristianTPclon> what should I put as my location if I'm in florida?  New york?
[03:28] <un_operateur1> maybe   sudo su; nano /etc/resolv.conf
[03:29] <Firebird> sudo -s -H will get you into root modus I believe
[03:29] <buddhalover> okat same error even after root
[03:29] <buddhalover> permissions unknown when checking propetries using gui
[03:29] <Firebird> that's an error in nano?
[03:30] <cchristianTPclon> what should I put as my location if I'm in florida?  New york?
[03:30] <radar1976> now I'm confused... does gksu "update-manager -c"  do a complete upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 ?
[03:30] <buddhalover> firebird. edit using?
[03:30] <un_operateur1> buddhalover, this ought to reset perms   chmod 755 /etc/resolv.conf
[03:30] <radar1976> if so, I ran it, and it is not doing that
[03:30] <un_operateur1> as root obviously
[03:30] <un_operateur1> sudo chmod 755 /etc/resolv.conf
[03:30] <Curs0r> it's not possible to convert my ntfs drives to ext3 without destroying the data is it?
[03:30] <Dev05> Hi! How can I do a feature request for Feisty?
[03:31] <un_operateur1> Curs0r, it's probably best to copy all data off, convert and then put it back on
[03:31] <fangorious> what process do I need to kick if my mounts in /media disappeared from my desktop?
[03:31] <un_operateur1> !fiesty
[03:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fiesty - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[03:31] <Curs0r> un_operateur1, dang, it's decidedly size-prohibitive
[03:32] <un_operateur1> I've never come across a way to convert ntfs to anything *nixy
[03:32] <Firebird> fat32 actually... using PM8
[03:32] <Firebird> ntfs->fat32 works
[03:32] <un_operateur1> fat32 :-s
[03:32] <un_operateur1> radar1976,  how about -- aptitude dist-upgrade
[03:32] <Firebird> once needed it to get rid of security thingies :)
[03:33] <chicken_Fire> mmmh is there a howto to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10?
[03:33] <cchristianTPclon> ok...  now it just froze..
[03:33] <un_operateur1> !upgrade | chicken_Fire
[03:33] <ubotu> chicken_Fire: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:33] <buddhalover> un_operateur1 : won't change permissions. io error
[03:33] <cchristianTPclon> is anyone going to help me?????
[03:33] <phlite_kontrol> yo, any idea how i can disable my laptop lid switch?
[03:33] <phlite_kontrol> fo reals now!
[03:33] <cchristianTPclon> PLEASE!!!
[03:33] <Curs0r> i will ms no more forever, not even as a secondary
[03:33] <chicken_Fire> thanks Ubotu!
[03:33] <un_operateur1> buddhalover, can you cat /etc/resolv.conf  ??
[03:34] <phlite_kontrol> yes put newyork if in florida eh?
[03:34] <phlite_kontrol> cchristianTPclon: newyork i'd say
[03:34] <phlite_kontrol> now for more important stuff :)
[03:34] <buddhalover> un_operateur1 : can't cat can't touch
[03:34] <phlite_kontrol> how do i disable my lid switch on my laptop!!!
[03:34] <cchristianTPclon> I tried, but I saw the time was wrong, so I tried to change it, then it froze...
[03:35] <buddhalover> un_operateur1 : can't mv.
[03:35] <Gibbonz> sounds like a disk/controller failure
[03:35] <un_operateur1> buddhalover, I think you might need to fsck that volume
[03:35] <cchristianTPclon> phlite_kontrol> battery settings
[03:35] <un_operateur1> or before doing that -- try editing resolv.conf in single user mode
[03:35] <phlite_kontrol> cchristianTPclon: well, flordia is EST so if its not right, maybe your bios clock is wrong?
[03:35] <dabaR_> buddhalover: also lay off the buddha
[03:35] <cchristianTPclon> hmmm
[03:35] <un_operateur1> maybe a process has a lock on resolv.conf now
[03:35] <cchristianTPclon> ok
[03:36] <phlite_kontrol> cchristianTPclon: is that while in ubuntu? a gui setting?
[03:36] <cchristianTPclon> now CTRL ALT DEL isn't working...
[03:36] <dabaR_> buddhalover: unless it is a religious thing:P
[03:36] <cchristianTPclon> I'm running it off the CD
[03:36] <cchristianTPclon> trying to install it
[03:36] <cchristianTPclon> along side my windows
[03:37] <cchristianTPclon> I'm using a differewnt computer
[03:37] <cchristianTPclon> it does not work
[03:37] <islan> cchristianTPclon, are you running a LiveCD, or are you using VMWar?
[03:37] <islan> VMWare*
[03:37] <cchristianTPclon> 'Live CD
[03:37] <iks> Hey all ! I just installed Feisty (reinstall in fact) and I tried to install everything that I needed (non-free things). I generally did that using Automatix but since I read it can cause problems I did it with normal apt-get...
[03:37] <islan> cchristianTPclon, then of course CTRL ALT DEL wont work
[03:37] <Taunto> is there a disk scanning program i can use before installing my ubuntu intsall
[03:37] <islan> that doesn't work in Linux, it's a Windows thing
[03:37] <iks> My first problem is that movies do not show previews...
[03:38] <iks> Do you have any idea abot how I can fix that ? :p
[03:38] <cchristianTPclon> Tianto> same thing going on here
[03:38] <un_operateur1> iks, did you know fiesty is not stable yet ?? :)
[03:38] <iks> un_operateur1, I do
[03:38] <iks> un_operateur1, I love bugs :)
[03:38] <islan> Taunto, are you talking about viewing your partitions?
[03:38] <cchristianTPclon> it froxze, but I can change workspaces...
[03:39] <Taunto> i can get the live cd ot boot and install anywhere from 50-60% but then my sy7stem freezes
[03:39] <iks> un_operateur1, (BTW I suppose you're french...)
[03:39] <prower> Okay, I got beryl running easily enough :> But not quake4 segfaults when I try to run it...is there something else I need to configure?
[03:39] <Firebird> cchristianTPclon, if you're really stuck try pressint ctrl+backspace to restart X
[03:39] <Firebird> pressing*
[03:39] <Taunto> i cant even change w*rkspaces
[03:39] <buddhalover> dabaR_::puff puff pass::
[03:39] <cchristianTPclon> ok, that's doing something...
[03:39] <un_operateur1> iks, no, i'm not french  -- my current nick is a nom-de-plume
[03:39] <un_operateur1> :)
[03:39] <iks> un_operateur1, oh ^^
[03:40] <islan> I haven't had much experience with LiveCD, then tend to have problems from running it directly from RAM
[03:40] <islan> they* tend
[03:40] <un_operateur1> anyway, iks, what did you want to do anyway?
[03:40] <buddhalover> un_operateur1 : how to detect  which process has a lock on resolv.conf
[03:40] <malt1> how would i set phpmyadmin in apache config to work with www.m4lt.com/~username/phpmyadmin or www.m4lt.com/phpmyadmin/ like what is a example of putting phpmyadmin in apache config for directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/
[03:40] <malt1> I'm running a ubuntu server to
[03:40] <un_operateur1> buddhalover, I think you can use a utility called lsof
[03:40] <iks> un_operateur1, so do you have any idea why I keep seeing the same icons for all my movies where I should see a preview of it ?
[03:40] <schisms> I have a question.
[03:40] <schisms> Are any of you familiar with linux from scratch?
[03:40] <islan> mostly because the GUIs of GNOME and KDE take up so much RAM
[03:41] <un_operateur1> iks, i'm sorry i cant really help with that -- i dont use gnome at all :)
[03:41] <Taunto> islan then what shud i install from ?
[03:41] <iks> un_operateur1, ok >_<
[03:41] <chicken_Fire> err: when doing gksu "update-manager -c", I get after clicking update to 6.10:
[03:41] <un_operateur1> maybe the forums have some hints on that issue, iks
[03:41] <Firebird> I don't think you need to configure anything in apache malt1, at least I never do :). Just put the phpmyadmin files in a 'phpmyadmin' directory directly under the web root and you'll be able to use that link
[03:41] <cchristianTPclon> it's still frozen
[03:41] <chicken_Fire> extracting '/tmp/tmpmvGAg8/edgy.tar.gz'
[03:41] <iks> right
[03:41] <compir99> is there a way to have wine create permissions of 775 automaticly?
[03:41] <islan> Taunto, I just make an installation CD instead of using LiveCD
[03:41] <chicken_Fire> authenticate '/tmp/tmpmvGAg8/edgy.tar.gz' against '/tmp/tmpmvGAg8/edgy.tar.gz.gpg'
[03:41] <iks> I didnt find anything on the french one but i'll try the english one ;)
[03:41] <chicken_Fire> can't find DistUpgradeViewGtk
[03:41] <chicken_Fire> wtf?
[03:41] <deep`> What will the next ubunturelase be named?
[03:41] <Taunto> ok where can i find instructions for that ?
[03:42] <un_operateur1> the next release 7.04 will be named fiesty
[03:42] <cchristianTPclon> .............
[03:42] <islan> Taunto, on Ubuntu's website
[03:42] <deep`> Ah, yes :D thats right
[03:42] <clayg> what is the name of the smp kernel?
[03:42] <kitche> deep`: fiesty fawn to be more percise
[03:42] <clayg> to apt-get it?
[03:42] <deep`> fiesty fawn, or something, right? :)
[03:42] <deep`> Yes :D
[03:42] <schisms> Are any of you familiar with linux from scratch?
[03:42] <un_operateur1> chicken_Fire, why dont you just do the usual apt-get method?? :)
[03:42] <islan> Taunto, it'll be an image CD just like the LiveCD was
[03:42] <Firebird> feisty actually :)
[03:42] <clayg> I have a core 2 duo
[03:42] <un_operateur1> apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:42] <deep`> thanx kitche =)

[03:43] <clayg> what is the name of the smp kernel?
[03:43] <kitche> echosystm: with LVM
[03:43] <schisms> What firebird?
[03:44] <Firebird> lfs
[03:44] <echosystm> ok
[03:44] <schisms> Ah
[03:44] <echosystm> now
[03:44] <Firebird> nm
[03:44] <echosystm> if im using lvm
[03:44] <chicken_Fire> the howto says about apt-get method: "Please note - this method is much less reliable. If you use this method, you MUST be prepared to fix problems manually"
[03:44] <deep`> cchristianTPclon, calm down :)
[03:44] <schisms> I was thinking gentoo or maybe slack
[03:44] <un_operateur1> mozilla-mplayer is just the plugin for your browsers -- to enable them to play multimedia
[03:44] <echosystm> i have to have a non-lvm boot partition right?
[03:44] <deep`> cchristianTPclon, alot of people come here for help, you know, your not the only one : )
[03:44] <cchristianTPclon> there's too many people here....
[03:44] <un_operateur1> it's not a standlone utility
[03:44] <schisms> I tried using ubuntu but it just didn't turn out good.
[03:44] <un_operateur1> you need mplayer instead
[03:44] <islan> cchristianTPclon, there always are
[03:44] <chicken_Fire> gksu "update-manager -c"  sould do all..
[03:44] <cchristianTPclon> I'm asking how to install it
[03:44] <phlite_kontrol> ok, i even tell ubuntu not to do anything ( in the power management area ) when the lid is closed, and it still logs out when the lid closes :"( any ideas peeps?
[03:44] <smithveg> un_operateur1, how can i enable them,?
[03:44] <islan> cchristianTPclon, that's why tells are so helpful
[03:44] <cchristianTPclon> huh?
[03:45] <un_operateur1> smithveg, install the mplayer or xmms packages
[03:45] <cchristianTPclon> islan>	what?
[03:45] <un_operateur1> chicken_Fire, errm .. in my experience that way works quite fine
[03:45] <un_operateur1> although i use aptitude instead
[03:45] <islan> cchristianTPclon, if you right-click on a username you can open a dialog window with them as a private or instant message
[03:45] <smithveg> un_operateur1, ya already got the mplayer
[03:46] <un_operateur1> aptitude dist-upgrade
[03:46] <chicken_Fire> well, I have a kubuntu instead of ubuntu...
[03:46] <un_operateur1> smithveg, aye, yes
[03:46] <smithveg> un_operateur1, you know what is happening to me right?
[03:46] <cchristianTPclon> I have to register
[03:46] <cchristianTPclon> I don't want to on this comp
[03:46] <smithveg> un_operateur1, i got mplayer movie player install
[03:46] <cchristianTPclon> It's not my comp
[03:47] <islan> cchristianTPclon, well still, just use people's names in your messages
[03:47] <islan> cchristianTPclon, much easier to see
[03:47] <un_operateur1> smithveg, ok, sorry, i misread you
[03:47] <cchristianTPclon> islan>	ok, I just rebooted
[03:47] <un_operateur1> yea, you need the mplayer or totem-xine mozilla packages to play an mp3 in your browser
[03:47] <smithveg> un_operateur1, so do you know what i'm missing here?
[03:47] <un_operateur1> i prefer mplayer-mozilla
[03:48] <un_operateur1> smithveg, i hope i do now :)
[03:48] <phlite_kontrol> ok, i even tell ubuntu not to do anything ( in the power management area ) when the lid is closed, and it still logs out when the lid closes :"( any ideas peeps?
[03:48] <cchristianTPclon> islan>	I can't install it, I have it running Live CD
[03:48] <un_operateur1> sorry for earlier
[03:48] <islan> cchristianTPclon, how much RAM do you have?
[03:48] <cchristianTPclon> I don't know
[03:48] <cchristianTPclon> but it's ALOT
[03:48] <cchristianTPclon> esp for a laptop
[03:48] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, it might be your BIOS controlling ACPI functions and that is overriding the OSes commands
[03:48] <dibblego> what is the easiest way to type characters such as mathematical symbols?
[03:48] <islan> cchristianTPclon, okay, then, what is the problem you are encountering again?
[03:49] <cchristianTPclon> well, I think I'm past the time problem...
[03:49] <evil_> is there a default root password?
[03:49] <cchristianTPclon> I'm putting NewYork
[03:49] <smithveg> ya, i already install Mozillla-Mplayer in synaptic
[03:49] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: in the bios i turned the lid switch off :(
[03:49] <wastrel> "hella"
[03:49] <cchristianTPclon> islan>	now I can't get it to install
[03:49] <un_operateur1> smithveg, and it still doesnt work?
[03:49] <un_operateur1> can you play mp3's normally?
[03:50] <clayg> guys is SMP good for a intel core 2 duo?
[03:50] <smithveg> still doens' wotk. even i close and open firefoz again
[03:50] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, recheck the BIOS
[03:50] <cchristianTPclon> hold on while I bring it up
[03:50] <islan> cchristianTPclon, there should be an icon on the desktop I think for the installation
[03:50] <un_operateur1> you probably overlooked something
[03:50] <iks> un_operateur1, just to tell you I found the solution : simply delete all folders in ~/.thumbnails (when it first generate the previews not having the correct codec it cant show the preview and it then save it in those folders)
[03:50] <phlite_kontrol> hmm maybe ...
[03:50] <cchristianTPclon> That's what I clicked
[03:50] <phlite_kontrol> I'll BE BACK
[03:50] <phlite_kontrol> ...
[03:50] <islan> cchristianTPclon, but again, I personally wouldn't recommend using LiveCD for installation, but that's just me
[03:50] <Fleebailey33>  im using grub and my issue that it wont boot. it hangs after fsck
[03:50] <Fleebailey33> feisty
[03:50] <un_operateur1> iks, cool, i'll remember that for the next time i use nautlius :)
[03:50] <clayg> how do i edit my bootloader
[03:50] <evil_> is there a default root password?
[03:50] <cchristianTPclon> I already have it, so I do it
[03:50] <iks> un_operateur1, never ? xD Do you use KDE ?
[03:50] <Starcraftmazter> I am having some trouble configuring my mouse, my scrollwheet acts as back / forward, and my back/forward buttons act as left-click, can someone suggest the setting to modify>?
[03:50] <wastrel> !feisty

[03:51] <un_operateur1> evil_ .. on ubuntu no
[03:51] <Fleebailey33> on live cd
[03:51] <iks> un_operateur1, I tried it on Mandriva today I think..
[03:51] <un_operateur1> on ubuntu, the default user is a proxy for root
[03:51] <Fleebailey33> if your asking that
[03:51] <islan> cchristianTPclon, so, are you encountering a problem?
[03:51] <iks> un_operateur1, anyway, thanks for helping ;) Good Day/Night (3 AM here in Paris)
[03:52] <cchristianTPclon> hold on
[03:52] <cchristianTPclon> I'm moving
[03:52] <smithveg> i'm trying to install the totem_xine now

[03:53] <cchristianTPclon> ok here
[03:53] <cchristianTPclon> now
[03:53] <arrenlex> Hallo.
[03:53] <smithveg> oxygenthief, is you experience the slow performance when you switch the firefox browser windows?
[03:53] <un_operateur1> mozilla runs slower on every release -- contradicting moore's law :)
[03:53] <cchristianTPclon> step 5 of 6 prepare disk space
[03:53] <wastrel> moore's law doesn't apply to software
[03:53] <smithveg> huh!
[03:54] <cchristianTPclon> islan> I want to install beside Windows
[03:54] <islan> it applies to processing power
[03:54] <coincoin169> where to tell kde not tu start programs that i have not closed on the previous session ???
[03:54] <smithveg> what is moore' law?
[03:54] <islan> cchristianTPclon, okay...?
[03:54] <oxygenthief> it's slow loading pages. typicaly whenever there is a picture on it
[03:54] <clayg> im stumped here, i have a intel core 2 duo
[03:54] <coincoin169> where to tell kde not to start programs that i have not closed on the previous session ???
[03:54] <clayg> should i have downloaded the 64 bit version
[03:54] <cchristianTPclon> without deleting windows
[03:54] <clayg> or just upgrade to sudo apt-get install linux-686-smp
[03:54] <islan> cchristianTPclon, yes, it's called dual-booting
[03:54] <arrenlex> coincoin169: kcontrol > KDE components > session manager
[03:55] <radar1976> so can I use apt to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10
[03:55] <arrenlex> ! upgrade | radar1976

[03:55] <nightless_> hello, for some reason i cannot open my CD drive from the file browser,. it says: unable to mount the selected volume when i try to open it :(
[03:55] <Gibbonz> cchristianTPclon: why are you trying to install an os on a comp that isn't yours? just curious
[03:55] <un_operateur1> radar1976, lol, thats the 6th time you've asked that question :)
[03:55] <cchristianTPclon> I have four options
[03:55] <cchristianTPclon> no
[03:55] <smithveg> hello,
[03:55] <cchristianTPclon> this comp im typing on isn't mine

[03:56] <cchristianTPclon> the one I'm installing to is my LapTop
[03:56] <radar1976> however I did those  instructions and I still have 6.06
[03:56] <islan> cchristianTPclon, please keep typing my name, you just need to type is and then hit tab
[03:56] <kishan> !fstab
[03:56] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[03:56] <islan> cchristianTPclon, okay
[03:56] <cchristianTPclon> islan: ok
[03:56] <smithveg> I have mplayer movie player, and totem-xine, totem-xine-mozilla-plugin.. install.. But when i open that forum. It still prompt me 'install missing plugins'
[03:57] <coincoin169> ok thx
[03:57] <nightless_> kishan, thanks :D
[03:57] <cchristianTPclon> islan: now, Resize IDE1 master, partition#1 (hda1) and use free space
[03:57] <islan> smithveg, those are programs that you have, you need the plugins for the programs
[03:57] <cchristianTPclon> islan: use largest continual free space
[03:57] <un_operateur1> smithveg, and when you clicked on 'install missing plugins'  -- did it tell you what plugins you were missing?
[03:57] <smithveg> That's the mp3 song in forums.
[03:57] <Spisters> hello, I am trying to install a font in my shared font folder but it is telling me I need to be root, I don't know how to use terminal very well, do I need to use the sudo command to do this?
[03:57] <cchristianTPclon> manually edit partition table
[03:58] <cchristianTPclon> or refrmat, but I don't want that...
[03:58] <smithveg> they tell me, the 'application/x-mplayer2' missing
[03:58] <cchristianTPclon> which one?
[03:58] <smithveg> un_operateur1, they tell me, the 'application/x-mplayer2' missing
[03:58] <islan> cchristianTPclon, does it not inform you what your partition currently looks like?
[03:58] <kishan> yes spinsters use sudo
[03:58] <cchristianTPclon> hmm?
[03:59] <un_operateur1> smithveg, I think your totem-xine-mozilla-plugin might be conflicting with mozilla-mplayer
[03:59] <cchristianTPclon> islan: I don't even know what that IS
[03:59] <un_operateur1> I'd uninstall it if i were you
[03:59] <Spisters> I can only use Sudo in terminal correct?
[03:59] <cchristianTPclon> I'm from before people started making up names...
[03:59] <kishan> yes spisters
[03:59] <un_operateur1> Spisters, you can only type it in a terminal, yes
[03:59] <Gibbonz> smithveg: you need the mozilla plugin for your choice of playback software, eg here i use vlc so I have the mozilla vlc plugin
[03:59] <kishan> !sudo
[03:59] <pauliukas> Hello everybody.
[03:59] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:59] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: dbl checked bios, its set to not do anything on close
[03:59] <fokuslee> hi : ) used umount /dev/sdb1 to umount my usb so i can use mkfs.vfat to format it.  comes back with sdb1 not in fstab how do i force an unmount?
[03:59] <pauliukas> Would USB2 HDD enclosures work with Ubuntu Server?

[03:59] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: so wtf :'(
[03:59] <islan> cchristianTPclon, does it not tell you how many partitions you have the size of each?
[03:59] <Spisters> ok, thanks
[04:00] <smithveg> Gibbonz, i do not sure...
[04:00] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, maybe you need to check if you have the latest ACPI software
[04:00] <cchristianTPclon> islan: no, I don't know what you are talking about
[04:00] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: hmmm how to check that
[04:00] <kitche> fokuslee: umount where your usb drive is mounted to
[04:00] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, errm, hold up
[04:00] <kishan> !usb
[04:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about usb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:00] <islan> cchristianTPclon, okay, go to manually edit partition table
[04:00] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: i'm currently up-to-date
[04:00] <Gibbonz> well if you use mplayer then you need mplayer-plugin-mozilla
[04:00] <Gibbonz> or whetever its called
[04:01] <un_operateur1> mozilla-mplayer
[04:01] <cchristianTPclon> yeah...
[04:01] <arrenlex> Gibbonz: mozilla-mplayer
[04:01] <fokuslee> kitche oh haha itz mounted to media
[04:01] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: as far as patches go
[04:01] <fokuslee> stupid me
[04:01] <cchristianTPclon> it's loading...
[04:01] <islan> cchristianTPclon, that should inform you of your partition table
[04:01] <cchristianTPclon> ij
[04:01] <cchristianTPclon> ok
[04:01] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, just to make sure -- aptitude install acpi acpid acpi-support
[04:01] <HyperHacker> hey

[04:02] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: k sec...
[04:02] <islan> cchristianTPclon, what does it say?
[04:02] <HyperHacker> what can I do if Ubuntu's live CD is hanging at "Loading device drivers"?
[04:02] <cchristianTPclon> it's charts and tables
[04:02] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, is your computer a fairly recent one?

[04:03] <fokuslee> kitche hey actually my usb is not showing up in fstab
[04:03] <islan> cchristianTPclon, it should make mention of hda1, etc
[04:03] <killerbeesateme> Hello Everyone, can anyone help me with an IVTV driver issue?  the driver appears to be installed properly and starts with no errors but it does not initialize the card
[04:03] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: ya it didn't get anything
[04:03] <HyperHacker> Pentium 2 350mhz, 192MB

[04:03] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, and you sure the settings in "power management" stick?
[04:03] <islan> cchristianTPclon, how many hda's are ther?
[04:03] <cchristianTPclon> islan> /dev/hda1 ?
[04:03] <transgress> anyone know of a way to record a webcam and a mic in one program?

[04:03] <cchristianTPclon> islan> unallocated
[04:03] <kishan> HyperHacker try to run live cd in other modes ...first check the cd for errors there is a option when u boot
[04:04] <HyperHacker> kishan, I did that
[04:04] <Gibbonz> anyway, any ideas why right click -> eject tries to write to an audio cd, or is this perhaps some quirk due to the drive being a cdrw?
[04:04] <ZephYr> quelqu'un parle t il franais ?
[04:04] <ZephYr> quelqu'un parle t il franais ?
[04:04] <cchristianTPclon> islan: now what
[04:04] <kishan> HyperHacker:all the modes have the same problem
[04:04] <un_operateur1> << un petit peu
[04:04] <HyperHacker> it said no checksums failed, took a while though

[04:04] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: yes the settings stick, tho they didn't till i did a logout and all that, hmm i see that there is some package called: i8kutils
[04:04] <HyperHacker> and it's actually "Loading hardware drivers" to be exact
[04:05] <Curs0r> is there an easy way to get xmms-projectM into edgy?
[04:05] <kitche> fokuslee: fstab is useful when you want something to mount at boot or if you just want to do mount <device> it will mount to whatever you have it being mounted to in your fstab
[04:05] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: how to get that? i have inspiron 8k
[04:05] <kishan> Hyperhacker: u using drapper live cd
[04:05] <cchristianTPclon> islan:  no symbol, just   nn.nn GiB
[04:05] <HyperHacker> I don't know what that is so I'm guessing no

[04:07] <un_operateur1> aptitude resolves deps better than apt-get does
[04:07] <radar1976> gksu "update-manager -c"  doesn't do an upgrade... let alone does not work on console system
[04:07] <arrenlex_> !aptitude | phlite_kontrol
[04:07] <ubotu> phlite_kontrol: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide

[04:08] <islan> cchristianTPclon, I take it you want Ubuntu to run in the second partition, then?
[04:08] <Desert88> is there anyway to get beryl in ubuntu?
[04:08] <HyperHacker> I've got some old TV tuner card in there that I suspect might be a problem, but I hope not because I was planning to make an HTPC out of it
[04:08] <cchristianTPclon> hmm?
[04:08] <fokuslee> kitche here is wut i have from mount
[04:08] <fokuslee> /dev/sdb1 on /media/MEMOREXTD type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,quiet,shortname=mixe
[04:08] <fokuslee> and i did umount /media/sdb1
[04:08] <Gibbonz> smithveg: no idea, i don't use mplayer :)
[04:08] <fokuslee> says not in mstab
[04:08] <islan> cchristianTPclon, hda1 should be windows, and should be partitioned as FAT32, while hda2 is unallocated or freespace, yes?
[04:09] <cchristianTPclon> islan: I guess so....  along side windows?  same files?
[04:09] <HyperHacker> it works in Windows XP on that computer but when I put it in my other system it  BSODs
[04:09] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, that probably is the reason why it's hanging -- bad drivers for your hardware
[04:09] <Desert88> How can I get beryl on Ubuntu?
[04:09] <cchristianTPclon> no
[04:09] <cchristianTPclon> hda 2 is fat32
[04:09] <un_operateur1> !beryl
[04:09] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[04:09] <kitche> fokuslee k you want to to use sudo unless your root already sudo umount /dev/sdb1 or umount /media/MEMOREXTD
[04:09] <cchristianTPclon> islan> hda 2 is fat32
[04:09] <smithveg> Gibbonz, what is the movie player youare using. elv? what what's kind of plugin u use for it?... i want to try this
[04:09] <islan> cchristianTPclon, what is hda1?
[04:09] <HyperHacker> that's what I was afraid of
[04:09] <killerbeesateme> hello, can someone help me with the ivtv driver?  i followed the wiki entry and everything seems to be ok but the card does not initialize and dmesg indicates no errors and the modules are loaded
[04:10] <cchristianTPclon> islan: hda1 is ntfs
[04:10] <radar1976> un_operateur1, I get no upgrade
[04:10] <HyperHacker> it's a Zoltrix TV tuner card, I'd have to open it up to check the chipset
[04:10] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, what you could do it take out the TV card, install and put it back in -- then try installing it's drivers
[04:10] <HyperHacker> nice idea, thankss
[04:10] <fokuslee> lol ok thx
[04:10] <fokuslee> kitche phew finally got it
[04:10] <fokuslee> thx
[04:10] <nokrev> Suddenly wpasupplicant is causing me all sorts of problems, whenever I try to dist-upgrade. I can't install it, and I can't remove it. I don't want it, as I'm not using wireless anyways. Something is very faulty about it.
[04:10] <un_operateur1> radar1976, oops, sorry , have you updated apt's sources.list ?
[04:10] <un_operateur1> !sources.list
[04:10] <nokrev> Can I just remove the .deb file itself, /var/cache/apt/archives/wpasupplicant_0.5.5-3v1ubuntu4_i386.deb?
[04:10] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource

[04:11] <arrenlex_> ?
[04:11] <islan> cchristianTPclon, ah, right, I'm sorry:  NTFS is Windows
[04:11] <cchristianTPclon> ok...
[04:11] <islan> cchristianTPclon, but you are not using the second partition, right?
[04:11] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: hmm, it dosen't find the packakge i8kutils, how do i check if i alredy have?
[04:12] <Gibbonz> smithveg: i'm using vlc from their own repository, not ubuntu's
[04:12] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: i made sure that universal was uncommented
=== arrenlex_ is now known as arrenlex
[04:12] <cchristianTPclon> it says that hda 2 has 6.44 Gib used..
[04:12] <un_operateur1> dpkg -l | grep -i i8kutils
[04:12] <nokrev> so, is it safe to simply delete the .deb file, /var/cache/apt/archives/wpasupplicant_0.5.5-3v1ubuntu4_i386.deb?
[04:12] <arrenle1> nokrev: Yes. That is a cache.
[04:12] <islan> cchristianTPclon, ah
[04:12] <islan> cchristianTPclon, I wonder what's in there...
[04:13] <islan> cchristianTPclon, I can't really tell you what the second partition is I'm afraid
[04:13] <cchristianTPclon> islan: fat32
[04:13] <islan> cchristianTPclon, I know what filesystem type it is, but do you know what's on it?
[04:14] <cchristianTPclon> islan: can I make a new ine
[04:14] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: hmm doesn't come up with anything, so maybe my reposittories don't have it? if u add more, how do u update? do u have to run a command, or just edit the file: /etc/apt/sources.llist ?
[04:14] <cchristianTPclon> how do I find out?
[04:14] <Curs0r> is it dangerous to install ftgl inubuntu?
[04:14] <islan> cchristianTPclon, as in, might it be a swap partition or might there have been another Linux OS installed prior...
[04:14] <islan> cchristianTPclon, I really can't say, I don't know how to mount filesystems in Windows, only in Linux
[04:14] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, I can find it i8kutils in my repos
=== arrenle1 is now known as arrenlex
[04:14] <cchristianTPclon> islan: never installed linux before
[04:15] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: hmm, which repo?
[04:15] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, hold up a sec, let me give you a more comprehensive sources.list
[04:15] <cchristianTPclon> how do I make a new partition?
[04:15] <cchristianTPclon> islan
[04:15] <islan> cchristianTPclon, I know, but since you only have windows installed, you can only use windows to check the partition
[04:16] <islan> cchristianTPclon, do you have any unallocated memory (ie, is freespace)
[04:16] <cchristianTPclon> yeah
[04:16] <jrib> Curs0r: what is ftgl?
[04:16] <cchristianTPclon> is MiB more than GiB
[04:16] <cchristianTPclon> ?
[04:16] <Gibbonz> other way
[04:16] <phlite_kontrol> mib is less then gib
[04:16] <cchristianTPclon> shit
[04:16] <phlite_kontrol> megabyte = 1000 kbyte
[04:16] <Curs0r> jrib,  some font utility for projectM
[04:17] <phlite_kontrol> gigabye = 1,000,0000 kbyte
[04:17] <cchristianTPclon> I know I have at least 50% unused space...
[04:17] <un_operateur1> Mib = 1024 Kib tho
[04:17] <gaurav19> Hi again, un_operateur1. I am trying to install Ubuntu 6.06 - drapper drake, I have the iso image mounted on the CD-ROM, when I restart the machine, the Ubuntu installer does not come up, even though the boot sequence is CD-Rom first
[04:17] <islan> cchristianTPclon, it should tell you on the partition table
[04:17] <phlite_kontrol> oh ya take off my k lol
=== DreamThief316 is now known as DreamThief
[04:17] <jrib> Curs0r: ftgl-dev is in the repos, is that the same/
[04:17] <un_operateur1> http://pastebin.ca/281862   phlite_kontrol  -- my sources.list
[04:17] <cchristianTPclon> ok, it sees 7.84 free Mib
[04:17] <cchristianTPclon> how is that?
[04:17] <phlite_kontrol> not good
[04:17] <Curs0r> jrib, couldn't hurt to try it
[04:18] <islan> cchristianTPclon, just because you have freespace on your windows partition does not mean you have freespace outside of that partition
[04:18] <Gibbonz> not a great fan of 'MiB' notation myself ;p
[04:18] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, did you say it goes back to booting from the CD again?
[04:18] <cchristianTPclon> hmmm
[04:18] <fnf> Hi, will anyone tell me is there a dock for GNOME which has the most features like Mac's please ?
[04:18] <cchristianTPclon> ok
[04:18] <HyperHacker> hm, I thought it was the other way around?
[04:18] <nokrev> Yeah, so, this wpasupplicant thing is really broken. http://pastebin.ca/281864
[04:18] <cchristianTPclon> that'd be it
[04:18] <un_operateur1> the MiB notation ought to be universal
[04:18] <islan> cchristianTPclon, you will have to resize the windows partition in order to get that space
[04:18] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: did ya find some info?
[04:18] <tur1> Hi any one here using ekiga?
[04:18] <wastrel> what's MiB
[04:18] <cchristianTPclon> islan: tell me how
[04:18] <nokrev> I can't install or remove it. I deleted the cache file, also.
[04:18] <jrib> !anyone | tur1
[04:18] <ubotu> tur1: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:18] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, did you see that paste i posted up there?
[04:18] <angel12> hey guys, i have a problem with my resolv.conf file. every time i reboot i have to edit it and delete a line in it, other wise i get dns errors
[04:18] <HyperHacker> 1MiB = 1,000,000  B; 1MB = 1,048,576 B?
[04:18] <islan> cchristianTPclon, did you run Defrag on your windows partition before trying to do this?
[04:18] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: think i missed it, lemme scroll up
[04:18] <angel12> is there any way to fix it so i dont have to do it every reboot?
[04:18] <cchristianTPclon> no
[04:18] <Gibbonz> to me MB = Mbyte, Mb = Mbit
[04:19] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, no , the other way around :)
[04:19] <fnf> HyperHacker: You got it backward
[04:19] <HyperHacker> hah
[04:19] <HyperHacker> well that explains some things then
[04:19] <tur1> ops sorry
[04:19] <gaurav19> no, I just put the iso Cd in the drive and restarted the machine, expecting the CD-Rom to get precedence over the primary hard disk and start the Installation
[04:19] <cchristianTPclon> I last ran it a few weeks ago
[04:19] <un_operateur1> Gibbonz, thats right
[04:19] <cchristianTPclon> been forgetting
[04:19] <islan> cchristianTPclon, I'd recommend that you do it again
[04:19] <HyperHacker> I guess Windows has it backward too then :p
[04:19] <cchristianTPclon> Litium Ion battery and all
[04:19] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, here it is again if you want -- http://pastebin.ca/281862
[04:19] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: ok got it ...
[04:19] <radar1976> so do I just add the edgy sources? and then I can do an upgrade?
[04:19] <Curs0r> jrib, good call, thanks man
[04:19] <nokrev> http://pastebin.ca/281864. I cannot remove or install wpasupplicant, and it seems to be corrupted. (Gar...)
[04:20] <islan> cchristianTPclon, you see, when you resize a partition, it has a chance to delete files from it
[04:20] <un_operateur1> radar1976, yes, add edgy sources and your all set for the upgrade
[04:20] <gaurav19> I guess that i have to initiate the installation through the CD while it is windows environment.. and then it will restart itself in a diff environment
[04:20] <islan> cchristianTPclon, defragging helps keep that chance low
[04:20] <tur1> I was looking for some who uses ekiga cause i jest configure mine and i would liketo test if its working
[04:20] <angel12> any ideas guys? i have to edit my resolv.conf file every reboot as it is right now
[04:20] <tur1> jest -> just
[04:20] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, I think you just need to adjust the BIOS to boot from CD first
[04:20] <cchristianTPclon> ee
[04:21] <HyperHacker> well, I got the TV card out but it still appears to be stuck at "Loading hardware drivers"
[04:21] <fnf> Is there a dock in GNOME which can show the opening applications, not just the launchers ?
[04:21] <frogzoo> angel12: u using dhcp?
[04:21] <angel12> gaurav19, you should set your bios to boot from cd
[04:21] <HyperHacker> does that normally take a while?
[04:21] <ephesius> does anyone know why the ipw2100 device doesnt work in edgy?
[04:21] <cchristianTPclon> so...
[04:21] <angel12> frogzoo, yeah
[04:21] <cchristianTPclon> islan: I defrag and resize?
[04:21] <cchristianTPclon> ok
[04:21] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: hmm i have all the edgy's don't c what im missing really
[04:21] <nokrev> So, no ideas?
[04:21] <cchristianTPclon> that's it
[04:21] <cchristianTPclon> ?
[04:21] <gaurav19> Thanks un_operateur1, I will try this again
[04:21] <tur1> anybody here i could call and try if my ekiga is working?
[04:21] <frogzoo> angel12: well the trouble is the dhcp server is giving you a bogus dns address - maybe that server's down atm?
[04:21] <niall> hi if I put in a dvd  in uuntu how can I make it play with vlc?
[04:21] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, errm ok .. if you hold up a sec, i'll do a test run to determine which repo
[04:21] <niall> IM using dapper
[04:21] <arrenlex> !dvd | niall
[04:21] <ubotu> niall: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[04:21] <islan> cchristianTPclon, yes
[04:22] <gaurav19> thanks angel12, I will try it again. I think the settings were not saved last timw
[04:22] <gaurav19> exit
[04:22] <cchristianTPclon> ok
[04:22] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: perfect
[04:22] <niall> thanks alot for the help
=== cchristianTPclon is now known as cchristianTPlurk
[04:22] <gaurav19> Thanks for your help
[04:22] <angel12> frogzoo, my dhcp server is my router, and that is being set in my resolv.conf every boot for my nameserver, and there is another entry in there too
[04:22] <gaurav19> quit
[04:22] <islan> cchristianTPclon, yes
[04:22] <frogzoo> angel12: which is?
[04:22] <islan> cchristianTPlurk, and be careful not to resize too much
[04:22] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol,   Get:1 http://uk.archive.ubuntu.com feisty/universe i8kutils 1.27 [31.4kB] 
[04:22] <Gibbonz> niall: see also System -> Preferences -> Removable Drives and Media
[04:22] <un_operateur1> seems like it is in universe
[04:23] <cchristianTPlurk> I know
[04:23] <angel12> frogzoo, its like 205.something, and thats the one i leave in there, and comment out 192.168.0.1
[04:23] <prower> Hmm...beryl seems to work pretty nicely :> Except for having to turn it off to play OpenGL-based games ;/
[04:23] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: is there a command u have to issue, to tell ubuntu that u edited that file?
[04:23] <angel12> and all works fine
[04:23] <niall> thanks Gibbonz
[04:23] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, ohh yea sorry
[04:23] <islan> cchristianTPlurk, I'd recommend taking the current size that is in use with Windows and increase that number by 125%, and leave hda1 that size
[04:23] <frogzoo> angel12: and the 192. is your router?
[04:23] <angel12> frogzoo, yeah
[04:23] <un_operateur1> aptitude update   phlite_kontrol
[04:23] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: k, lemme try
[04:23] <un_operateur1> aptitude update && aptitude upgrade
[04:23] <malt1> what do i need to install to get php nuke and phpbb to send a email for email confirm to the users?
[04:24] <frogzoo> angel12: yeah, what's happening is your router is sending both dns addresses - any way to turn that off on the router? (the 205. comes from the router's own dhcp)
[04:24] <angel12> frogzoo, no clue let me check, its a crappy dsl modem with a wireless router lol
[04:25] <HyperHacker> yep, still hanging :-(
[04:25] <un_operateur1> you can always override and use manual dns settings
[04:25] <islan> cchristianTPlurk, so if say inside your windows partition you have 50gigs in use of 100, make the partition about 65gigs
[04:25] <HyperHacker> or taking AGES anyway
[04:25] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, it probably is another peice of hardware thats causing it to hang
[04:25] <un_operateur1> not the TV card as we expected
[04:25] <un_operateur1> have any legacy hardware in that box?
[04:26] <islan> cchristianTPlurk, and I think I am going to head off now, so good luck
[04:26] <cchristianTPlurk> FAT was my mem card, I left it in
[04:26] <nokrev> Is it possible to run AIGLX/Compiz/Emerald, rather than AIGLX/Compiz/Metacity...?
[04:26] <Gibbonz> my comp defines legacy :p
[04:26] <alexicon> hello
[04:26] <frogzoo> anyone experiencing problems with amarok not opening mms: net radio sites ?
[04:26] <cchristianTPlurk> bye
[04:26] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: ahh, finallyf ound it
[04:26] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol,  :)
[04:26] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: installing
[04:26] <un_operateur1> cool
[04:26] <HyperHacker> un_operateur1, could only be the network card, hard drive, or motherboard
[04:26] <Gibbonz> by current standards anyway
[04:26] <un_operateur1> << crosses fingers for phlite_kontrol
[04:26] <angel12> nokrev, isnt emerald for beryl?
[04:27] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: gotta do anytyhing to ubuntu to see new packages?
[04:27] <angel12> frogzoo, i cant find anything about that
[04:27] <nokrev> angel12: yes, but it's just a theme manager... in theory, it should be usable with anything, right?
[04:27] <alexicon> ive got an issue with kubuntu where it will not let me connect to any wifi networks. its a vaio sz laptop. does anyone know if ubuntu has the same wifi problem?
[04:27] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, aptitude upgrade
[04:27] <nokrev> angel12: in the same way compiz uses metacity now, it should be able to use emerald
[04:27] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, are you looking to install ubuntu on this run -- or just see what the liveCD is all about?
[04:27] <angel12> nokrev, im not too sure, i mean, you couldnt use kde themes with gnome, i would think its the same idea
[04:28] <nokrev> (in the same way Beryl can use metacity themes, too)
[04:28] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: but do i have to do anything to tell ubuntu to use this i8kutils with this laptop and stuff?
[04:28] <HyperHacker> I was hoping to install it to check it out and make a MythTV box
[04:28] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: or does it just do it after the upgrade?
[04:28] <HyperHacker> it's that or a similar program in Windows which runs sloooooow on this box
[04:28] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, errm, i'm not sure dude -- i'd read up on the man page or website for that package
[04:28] <alexicon> are there any known issues with ubuntu wifi and laptops??
[04:28] <frogzoo> angel12: is there a checkbox for caching dns queries? try turning it of & restart everything
[04:28] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: k
[04:29] <un_operateur1> each package has different requirements on part of the user
[04:29] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, if you're sure about installing, you can install in text mode
[04:29] <nightless_> !drives
[04:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about drives - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:29] <un_operateur1> perhaps that'll help .. just a jab in the dark
[04:29] <HyperHacker> eh, I'm a total newbie to Linux
[04:30] <nightless_> !fstab
[04:30] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions

[04:30] <HyperHacker> last time I did a text-mode install I accidentally wiped my hard disk and didn't manage to boot anything
[04:30] <arrenlex> nokrev: What would happen if you ran "sudo apt-get install --reinstall wpasupplicant"?
[04:30] <angel12> frogzoo, could it be NAT (name address translation)
[04:30] <radar1976> ok who has a fast apt-get mirror
[04:30] <HyperHacker> though that _was_ with Gentoo >_>
[04:30] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, the text mode isnt really about typing any commands -- it's about using a non-GUI interface called ncurses -- like that of a BIOS
[04:30] <HyperHacker> thanks for the link anyway
[04:30] <cyphase> http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/12/16/time.you.tm/index.html
[04:30] <radar1976> archive.ubuntu.com is slowwwwwwww
[04:30] <HyperHacker> I might do it that way if need be, this hard drive's unimportant ;-)
[04:30] <frogzoo> angel12: no, you need nat unless you have a static ip
[04:30] <un_operateur1> radar1976, you can use a local mirror instead
[04:31] <superkirbyartist> Every time I restart Ubuntu my "/dev/modem" disappears and I have to reinstall the drivers.
[04:31] <niall> what is libdvdcss
[04:31] <niall> ?
[04:31] <HyperHacker> superkirbyartist, get broadband? ;-)
[04:31] <Gibbonz> dvd decryption
[04:31] <bruenig> !libdvdcss
[04:31] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[04:31] <angel12> niall, lets you play dvd's
[04:31] <arrenlex> niall: A library to decrypt DVDs.
[04:31] <wastrel> superkirbyartist:  you probably just need to set the driver to start @ boot time
[04:31] <HyperHacker> lol
[04:31] <arrenlex> niall: And thus, not legal is most places.
[04:31] <Gibbonz> lets you play commercial DVDs
[04:31] <radar1976> woohoo
[04:31] <niall> why do I need it why does ubuntu not just come with it
[04:31] <niall> ?
[04:31] <HyperHacker> I was going to answer niall but you people are just too dang fast
[04:31] <angel12> frogzoo, then i dont see anything for dns
[04:32] <frogzoo> superkirbyartist: can you use the real /dev/tty## instead of /dev/modem?
[04:32] <arrenlex> niall: Because it is not legal in most places. xD
[04:32] <radar1976> ok   that was good switch...  I switched wireless cards
[04:32] <radar1976> hehehe
[04:32] <Gibbonz> because of license restrictions, legal implications
[04:32] <wastrel> superkirbyartist:  do you know the name of the driver ?   you can add it to /etc/modules
[04:32] <superkirbyartist> I know, it's slow, but I need to use it sometimes, depending on my location.
[04:32] <Gibbonz> etc..
[04:32] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, its the bot talking :)
[04:32] <frogzoo> angel12: k, well look for a firmware upgrade for your router
[04:32] <niall> but I got the disc from blockbuster how is it not legal?
[04:32] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: no worky, i bet theres a kernel command to disable that eh?
[04:32] <HyperHacker> yeah, but a bunch of other people replied too, heh
[04:33] <wastrel> superkirbyartist:  or you could manually load the driver with modprobe prolly, if you don't need it running all the time.
[04:33] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, what you could try doing is probably disabling the ACPI daemon totally
[04:33] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: ok, how?
=== ProN00b is now known as ProN00bX
[04:33] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, i dont use gnome -- but i do know its in the services manager
[04:33] <arrenlex> niall: That's how the DMCA works.
[04:33] <dabaR> niall: the program that decrypts dvds in ubuntu or pretty much any distro is illegal in some countries.
[04:33] <ezerhoden> does ubuntu have a package for xproto?
[04:33] <arrenlex> niall: I don't agree with it, I'm just saying that's how it is.
[04:33] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: ok, lemme look
[04:33] <Gibbonz> the disc is legal, playing it back on an unlicenesed player is
[04:33] <ezerhoden> or a packages containing xproto?
[04:34] <Gibbonz> unlicensed*
[04:34] <niall> oh I get it
[04:34] <niall> thanks
[04:34] <niall> so I should change the player
[04:34] <superkirbyartist> It's Linuxant HCF driver.
[04:34] <jrib> ezerhoden: have you tried searching packages.ubuntu.com?
[04:34] <dabaR> niall: you should follow the instructions given above
[04:35] <ezerhoden> jrib, will do , thanks
[04:35] <jrib> ezerhoden: x11proto-core-dev is what you want I think
[04:35] <niall> I tried to find libdvdcss @ http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages but its not ther
[04:35] <niall> its cool
[04:35] <wastrel> superkirbyartist:  do you know the name of the driver file ?
[04:35] <Gibbonz> linux cannot legally include it because to do so would mean someone having to pay royalties for the decryption stuff
[04:35] <ezerhoden> jrib, thanks, its for a m8
[04:35] <niall> ahh
[04:35] <niall> i see
[04:35] <Gibbonz> ie, just not possible for a community project
[04:36] <un_operateur1> maybe ubuntu doesnt include it because of fears of being prosecuted against
[04:36] <niall> thanks for your help
[04:36] <arrenlex> niall: http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl/pool/edgy-seveas/extras/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-0.0ubuntu4_i386.deb
[04:37] <Gibbonz> libdvdcss is the only way to play commercial DVDs at the moment, until such time the law/licensing changes
[04:37] <GenNMX> Hmmm how good is partimage? I'm thinking for full backups, one compressed image per month might be better then just tar.
[04:37] <mikebot> is there a free program on windows i can use to watch tv? (if i have a card witha  coax slot)?
[04:37] <HyperHacker> AHA
[04:37] <HyperHacker> it didn't hang this time :-)
[04:37] <un_operateur1> mikebot, errm, this isnt #windows  :)
[04:38] <mikebot> un_operateur1: sorry
[04:38] <mikebot> un_operateur1: can you help me with ubuntu then?
[04:38] <un_operateur1> np .. just making sure you're in the right room
[04:38] <phxheat> hi, how can i install/emulate ubuntu in windows xp?
[04:38] <HyperHacker> mikebot, it's called Ubuntu in VMWare ;-)
[04:38] <un_operateur1> mikebot, playing TV on ubntu?
[04:38] <HyperHacker> pxheat, same answer, lol
[04:38] <arrenlex> phxheat: By using vmware, or microsoft virtual pc, or qemu.
[04:38] <phxheat> weird timing
[04:39] <mikebot> i'mt rying to get my dsl working on it, but when i do 'sudo pppoeconf' i get something that says 'Sorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access Controller of your provider did not respdon...'
[04:39] <arrenlex> phxheat: Or other such thing.
[04:39] <mikebot> un_operateur1: well i want to use mythtv on ubuntu
[04:39] <mikebot> but i can't download it cause i can't get the internet working yet
[04:39] <dabaR> arrenlex: click your link above.
[04:39] <un_operateur1> mikebot, hmm -- are you sure your link's a PPPoE link?
[04:39] <Arithmomaniac> I'm a newbie on my Windows side right now. Is there no way to enable network PlugnPlay support like there is in windows?
[04:40] <mikebot> un_operateur1: not sure what that even means--i'm using dsl (SBCIS)
[04:40] <DaRkNeSS|> wow lots of people here
[04:40] <Gibbonz> i cant see blu-ray taking off with all the restrictions it has, i thought HD in general was bad ;p
[04:40] <un_operateur1> mikebot, do you use a router or cable modem ??
[04:40] <mikebot> un_operateur1: and i have like a dsl modem; and i have to use a username and passwrod for it
[04:40] <HyperHacker> un_operateur1, PPPoE = Point-to-Point over Ethernet
[04:40] <DaRkNeSS|> so im running windows xp and some friends from a quake mod were telling me about ubuntu
[04:40] <HyperHacker> that's all I know about it
[04:40] <DaRkNeSS|> showing me screenshots and stuff
[04:40] <arrenlex> dabaR, my bad, thank you.
[04:40] <un_operateur1> mikebot, yea, thats probably PPPoE
[04:40] <mikebot> i don't know if it's a modem or router...i plug the phone line into it and from that the ternet to my computer
[04:40] <HyperHacker> Gibbonz, agreed... not buying from Sony anymore
[04:40] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, thanks, i do know what it is :)
[04:40] <arrenlex> dabar, niall: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/pool/edgy-seveas/extras/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-0.0ubuntu4_i386.deb
[04:40] <DaRkNeSS|> is it an easy installation
[04:41] <Arithmomaniac> For example, on a random DSL network, it autoconnects in windows (and even in DSL) but does not in ubuntu
[04:41] <dabaR> arrenlex: seveas.ubuntulinux.nl never allows downloads, as I found out the same way you just did:) niall seems to be gone
[04:41] <arrenlex> Oh, so he does. Oh well.
[04:41] <arrenlex> dabaR: Now I know.
[04:41] <mikebot> un_operateur1: Do you know how I can fix that error?
[04:41] <un_operateur1> mikebot, so its a phone line -- not cable eh?? that might be PPPoA rather than PPPoE
[04:41] <Gibbonz> i'm curious as to whats gonna happen with hd-dvd though... not seen anything on that yet
[04:42] <HyperHacker> I think HD-DVD is a sure win
[04:42] <mikebot> un_operateur1: yikes, I don't know--I don't plug the phone line into my computer, but into the 'box', and form that an eternet to my computer
[04:42] <HyperHacker> the tech-savvy know why to avoid Blu-ray
[04:42] <HyperHacker> the rest will buy it because of the name
[04:42] <mikebot> un_operateur1: PPPoE sounds familiar though
[04:42] <Gibbonz> thats a good point ;p
[04:42] <un_operateur1> mikebot, errm, how does the modem connect to computer?
[04:42] <briguyd> neither of my disc drives work
[04:42] <DaRkNeSS|> anyone?
[04:42] <HyperHacker> if HD-TV = TV but better, HD-DVD = ?
[04:42] <nightless_> HyperHacker, bluray, i work at blockbuster, all major film corps have signed on already
[04:42] <briguyd> they spin, but they cant be mounted for some reason
[04:42] <DaRkNeSS|> is there an ubuntu chan for helping ppl install
[04:42] <DaRkNeSS|> or questions
[04:42] <HyperHacker> it's popular, no doubt
[04:42] <jrib> DaRkNeSS|: this one
[04:43] <DaRkNeSS|> well im asking and no one is responding
[04:43] <Gibbonz> and one can easily see why they would
[04:43] <jrib> !patience | DaRkNeSS|
[04:43] <ubotu> DaRkNeSS|: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[04:43] <jrib> hmm that isn't what I meant
[04:43] <HyperHacker> that's why now is the time for anti-DRM movements to start informing people of the hazards
[04:43] <briguyd> why cant i mount my cd or dvd rom drives?
[04:43] <mikebot> !pppoe
[04:43] <ubotu> Setting up an ADSL/PPPoE connection? Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ADSLPPPoE
[04:43] <DaRkNeSS|> im patient lol
[04:43] <DaRkNeSS|> im in no rush
[04:43] <nightless_> does anyone have a working cd drive and can post there fstab up on pastebin for me to take a look at?
[04:43] <nightless_> their *
[04:43] <jrib> DaRkNeSS|: sometimes people don't know the answer, just wait a bit and repeat maybe every 15 minutes so new people can see your question
[04:44] <mikebot> is there a place where I can look up solutions to different errors?
[04:44] <arrenlex> mikebot: What errors are these?
[04:44] <nightless_> mikebot, enter the error into google
[04:44] <advcomp2019> does anyone remember my problem a few days ago
[04:44] <nightless_> mikebot, usually works, or ask it here
[04:44] <HyperHacker> tsk, I forgot to plug the mouse in
[04:44] <jrib> DaRkNeSS|: yes, it's an easy installation
[04:44] <HyperHacker> how do I reboot Ubuntu without a mouse?
[04:44] <un_operateur1> mikebot, you didnt tell me how modem hooks upto computer eh
[04:44] <arrenlex> HyperHacker: Do you have access to a terminal?
[04:45] <HyperHacker> arrenlex, no, it's just started up and is sitting at the desktop
[04:45] <mikebot> arrenlex: I'm trying to get internet working on ubuntu, and when i do 'sudo pppoeconf' I get the error: 'Sorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access Controller of your provider did not respdon...'
[04:45] <jrib> mikebot: help.ubuntu.com bugs.ubuntu.com ubuntuforums.org are good starts, followed by www.google.com
[04:45] <arrenlex> HyperHacker: Press ctrl+alt+f1 to go to a virtual console. Then press ctrl+alt+del.
[04:45] <mikebot> un_operateur1: oh sorry, didn't see that. by ethernet
[04:45] <HyperHacker> ah, thanks
[04:45] <briguyd> can someone help me mount my dvd and cd rom drives?
[04:46] <HyperHacker> heh, virtual console
[04:46] <wastrel> or you can type sudo reboot
[04:46] <kishan> mikebot: try restarting the modem and try again
[04:46] <HyperHacker> can I play NES games on it!1!1?
[04:46] <HyperHacker> :p
[04:46] <Gibbonz> mind, i've still yet to see HD for myself. Probably wait till its been de-hdcp'ed ;p
[04:46] <wastrel> you need X to play nes games afaik
[04:46] <arrenlex> xD
[04:46] <dabaR> DaRkNeSS|: the installation is easy, yes.
[04:46] <arrenlex> !kiddling | HyperHacker
[04:46] <mikebot> kishan: I did that, and I also tried 'pon pppoe' or some such command
[04:46] <un_operateur1> mikebot, ok, errm, do you know the make and model # of the modem? maybe someone else out there has figured out how to use it with linux
[04:46] <nightless_> DaRkNeSS|, it's the easiest installation of any linux distro :P pop it in wait for it to boot click on install :)
[04:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kiddling - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:46] <DaRkNeSS|> finally someone asks
[04:46] <arrenlex> Whoa.
[04:46] <arrenlex> !kidding | HyperHacker
[04:46] <ubotu> HyperHacker: You may think your joke is funny, but you may confuse new users or irritate people who actually start answering your question :)
[04:46] <anddreaz> hi
[04:46] <DaRkNeSS|> i jus thad some questions though
[04:46] <arrenlex> Although wastrel should have known better.
[04:47] <DaRkNeSS|> do i need to back up all my files then put them back on after installing
[04:47] <christiane> Hello. Does anyone know why /etc/init.d/cryptsetup complains about wrong passphrase w/o asking for one when started at boot?
[04:47] <HyperHacker> heh
[04:47] <DaRkNeSS|> or will it save the files
[04:47] <mikebot> un_operateur1: Yeah, it's a Westell WireSpeed, I use it for SBCIS (Pacbell dsl)
[04:47] <kishan> mikebot: sudo ifconfig iwconfig  paste bin it
[04:47] <wims> i just installed mysql, shouldn't i have mysql_config ?
[04:47] <dabaR> DaRkNeSS|: it should save the files, but backups are just that, back ups for just in case.
[04:48] <un_operateur1> mikebot, do you have the specific model # ??
[04:48] <dabaR> DaRkNeSS|: so, I never had trouble, but always backed up important data
[04:48] <mikebot> kishan: is that all one line?
[04:48] <advcomp2019> i had a hibernate issue a few days ago. some one gave me a fix, but it worked for three restarts. now it will not go into hibernate again.
[04:48] <DaRkNeSS|> im not that smart with computers compared to you guys.. what are my chances of messing my comp up
[04:49] <christiane> The onl yline in /etc/crypttab is "luks-name   /dev/sda8    none    luks"
[04:49] <mikebot> un_operateur1: it's a relaly long model number
[04:49] <ubut> I am on livecd; how to mount /dev/hdd5 so that users other than root can access it?
[04:49] <HyperHacker> mikebot, type "sudo ifconfig iwconfig" in your console and post the result on pastebin
[04:49] <dabaR> DaRkNeSS|: on a scale or in percentage, and would you like it calculated using the werner method, or the pithagoras theorem?
[04:49] <un_operateur1> mikebot -- the first 2 parts ought to do like -- A90-210030
[04:50] <un_operateur1> HyperHacker, he isnt using wireless dude
[04:50] <advcomp2019> does any one know why hibernate does not work again
[04:50] <dabaR> DaRkNeSS|: you have an OK chance of everything working great, if you ask before you do anything you are not sure of.
[04:50] <nightless_> guys this cdrom thing is irking me to no end, im fooled with fstab ive even tried good ole' sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom but it still says no meduim found
[04:50] <radar1976> well  no fast mirrors
[04:50] <HyperHacker> I was just clarifying what kishan told him :-/
[04:50] <ubut> I am on livecd; how to mount /dev/hdd5 so that users other than root can access it?
[04:50] <un_operateur1> radar1976, what speeds are you getting?
[04:50] <nightless_> is there documentation _specifically_ for ubuntu edgy disc drives?
[04:50] <DaRkNeSS|> if i were to get on this server with my laptop while installing on my desktop, could people help me if some problem comes up?
[04:50] <ubut> anyone?
[04:51] <master_tux> hmm?
[04:51] <nightless_> DaRkNeSS|, we will try :)
[04:51] <un_operateur1> nightless_, have you tried another CD ?? perhaps that particular CD is a bit iffy
[04:51] <nightless_> un_operateur1, it's a WoW cd, official not burned
[04:51] <christiane> Calling cryptsetup manually works. Is there an error in the crypttab line?
[04:51] <ubut> anyone see my question?
[04:51] <un_operateur1> nightless_, still --
[04:51] <radar1976> 34k/sec
[04:52] <advcomp2019> does anyone see me typing
[04:52] <master_tux> ubut: please say it again?
[04:52] <nightless_> un_operateur1, sure ill try another
[04:52] <jrib> advcomp2019: yes
[04:52] <un_operateur1> radar1976, whoa -- you should be getting atleast 10x that
[04:52] <ubut> master_tux:  I am on livecd; how to mount /dev/hdd5 so that users other than root can access it?
[04:52] <master_tux> change the permission
[04:52] <radar1976> I knoq
[04:52] <kishan> mikebot sorry type sudo iwconfig ; sudo ifconfig : pastebin the result
[04:52] <master_tux> you have gnome?
[04:52] <radar1976> err know
[04:53] <advcomp2019> ok.  does anyone know how to fix this hibernate issue that i had then i fixed then it came back
[04:53] <ubut> master_tux: how?
[04:53] <jrib> ubut: what filesystem?
[04:53] <nightless_> un_operateur1, i put in an audio cd and that autoplayed O_O
[04:53] <radar1976> considering I have 800+MB
[04:53] <radar1976> I would like more speeds
[04:53] <pauliukas> Would a USB2 HDD enclosure work with Ubuntu Server? Anything to configure? Is it easy to do? How about Firewire?
[04:53] <un_operateur1> nightless_, so you see  -- some CDs are iffy :)
[04:53] <ubut> jrib: its ntfs
[04:53] <master_tux> jrib: I dont think that matters, if root can access it the others can to
[04:53] <nightless_> un_operateur1, ok but i _have_ to have these wow cds work, it's the only reason i own a computer :(
[04:54] <un_operateur1> wow is??
[04:54] <nightless_> yessah
[04:54] <master_tux> ubut: type man chmod in a shell
[04:54] <jrib> ubut: sudo mkdir /media/windows && sudo mount -t ntfs -o umask=0222 /dev/hda5 /media/windows    I think...
[04:54] <un_operateur1> nightless_, you mentioned CDs as in plural -- try another wow CD
[04:55] <ubut> ok thanks..
[04:55] <DaRkNeSS|> well thanks for not helping
[04:55] <DaRkNeSS|> im going to the other server
[04:55] <DaRkNeSS|> irc.quakenet.org #ubuntu
[04:55] <radar1976> so any server faster? I have 10MBit connection
[04:55] <master_tux> ubut: just read what the manual says for chmod, it will tell you what you need to know
[04:55] <thcrw8383> dose anyone know where i can find the login/logoff sounds from Ubuntu 6.06?
[04:55] <un_operateur1> thcrw8383, locate login.wav   i think
=== [1] wenko2 is now known as wenko
[04:56] <un_operateur1> /usr/share/sounds
[04:56] <ubut> master_tux: if that is a ext* parttion, i do chmod as u said, files are on that parttion will change permision when i unmouted?
[04:56] <thcrw8383> I mean the sound files
[04:56] <radar1976> dammit
[04:56] <un_operateur1> radar1976, maybe you could try uk.archive.ubuntu.com or jp..
[04:56] <nightless_> un_operateur1, cd2 mounted ok :(
[04:56] <master_tux> ubut: you said you have NTFS file system, so you cannot edit permissions permenently without ntfs tools
[04:56] <nightless_> un_operateur1, this is not good, i need cd1 :( :(
[04:57] <un_operateur1> nightless_, errm .. are you sure that CD works well elsewhere? on another computer?
[04:57] <radar1976> ok  uk. is 45k/sec
[04:57] <jrib> master_tux: if it's ntfs he shouldn't chmod after mounting, he should just mount with a proper umask
[04:57] <CreativeEmbassy> Alright, I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 6.06 I'm running right now, what's the quickest route to 6.10?
[04:57] <ifti> Hi
[04:57] <un_operateur1> maybe your CD-rom drive is on its last legs?
[04:57] <ifti> I'm in a bit of jam
[04:57] <nightless_> un_operateur1, yes perfectly, and theres not a single nick or scratch this is only the second time ive ever taken it from its case
[04:57] <master_tux> jrib: i find it easier to use chmod....
[04:57] <christiane> If I run `/etc/init.d/cryptdisks start` manually from init 2 o
[04:58] <christiane> it works too
[04:58] <nightless_> un_operateur1, its possible :(
[04:58] <arrenlex> !update | CreativeEmbassy
[04:58] <ubotu> CreativeEmbassy: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:58] <jrib> master_tux: how?  you have to chmod everytime then.  If you stick the umask in your fstab then you don't worry about it
[04:58] <ifti> I just installed ubuntu 6.06 on my IBM T30, and in the process of trying to get my wireless card to work I somehow screwed up my network settings
[04:58] <un_operateur1> nightless_, one sec
[04:58] <master_tux> jrib: he has a live cd, he cannot do that
[04:58] <ifti> with the effect that I can't connect even through the built in NIC
[04:58] <jrib> master_tux: right
[05:00] <Gibbonz> so -o remount,umask=0222 then perhaps :)
[05:00] <ifti> I've been typing /etc/init.d/networking restart in the terminal
[05:00] <frogzoo> CreativeEmbassy: best way to move to 6.10 imo is to just clean install
[05:00] <christiane> What is missing in runlevel 1 that cryptsetup doesn't ask for passphrase?
[05:00] <ifti> and getting ifdown: failed to open statefile /var/run/network/ifstate:permision denied
[05:01] <un_operateur1> iftu -- did you forget to sudo that command?
[05:01] <Gibbonz> using sudo?
[05:01] <nightless_> un_operateur1, got it mounted
[05:01] <Gibbonz> lol
[05:01] <nightless_> un_operateur1, must be the cdromdrive
[05:01] <ifti> oh sorry
[05:01] <ifti> I have been sudo ing it
[05:01] <un_operateur1> nightless_, yea, it's quite likely
[05:01] <ifti> I just forgot to type that in the message
[05:02] <ifti> so I still can't get connected to my network
[05:02] <ifti> it was working fine when I first installed
[05:02] <radar1976> *screams*
[05:02] <frogzoo> ifti: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[05:02] <radar1976> I need faster speeds
[05:02] <ifti> frogzoo: I've been doing that
[05:02] <un_operateur1> radar, you could try either of the kr or jp mirrors -- they tend to be quite speedy
[05:03] <ifti> and it says OK
[05:03] <mikebo1> OK, how do i use pastebin?
[05:03] <ifti> but still can't connect
[05:03] <wastrel> ifti:  your /etc/network/interfaces is probably not configured correctly for your NIC
[05:03] <ifti> Wastrel: what do I put in it?
[05:03] <mikebo1> !pastebin
[05:03] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:03] <un_operateur1> mikebo1, paste your code in .. and submit it -- it gives you a url to use
[05:03] <ifti> is there some default settings for it
[05:04] <radar1976> oh much better
[05:04] <advcomp2019> if the NIC is a broadcom NIC i have had issues with wired and wireless one.
[05:04] <wastrel> ifti:  is your NIC eth0 or eth1 ?
[05:04] <radar1976> I'm getting 350k/sec to 400k/sec
[05:04] <ifti> eth0
[05:04] <ifti> it was working fine
[05:04] <ifti> until I tried to get my Wifi card to work
[05:05] <mikebo1> un_operateur1: HyperHacker kishan: OK, this is from 'sudo ifconfig' http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37496/
[05:05] <ifti> i think I screwed something up in the process
[05:05] <ubut> ops
[05:05] <wastrel> ifti:  do you have a dhcp server on your network or do you need to configure it manually?   what does  ifconfig eth0  show?
[05:05] <un_operateur1> ifti, you should be ok to delete the file and restart networking
[05:05] <HyperHacker> mikebot, I was just clarifying kishan's instructions, I don't actually know how to help you X-)
[05:05] <uffiole> hi. how can i find out what audio driver my system uses?
[05:05] <ifti> I have a DHCP server
[05:05] <ubut> i am on livecd (current daily) ; how to play mp3?
[05:05] <ifti> I can just delete the whole file?
[05:06] <uffiole> xmms works with oss, but mplayer does crazy noise
[05:06] <wastrel> back it up first
[05:06] <master_tux> ubut: depends on what music player you have
[05:06] <un_operateur1> mikebo1, I dunno why kishan asked you to do that -- its quite pointless at this stage
[05:06] <ifti> will try
[05:06] <wastrel> i'm not familiar with /etc/init.d/networking
[05:06] <uffiole> ubut: maybe mpg123 ?
[05:06] <mikebo1> un_operateur1: he told me to do 'sudo ifconfig iwconfig'
[05:06] <ubut> master_tux: i want to install it
[05:06] <mikebo1> but that gave me an error, something like 'can't find wireless'
[05:06] <frogzoo> ifti: ls /var/run/network/
[05:06] <master_tux> ubut: install your live cd?
[05:07] <un_operateur1> mikebo1, aye yea .. you dont have a wireless card do you?
[05:07] <ubut> yes uffiole; how install it or mp3blaster
[05:07] <jrib> !mp3 | ubut

[05:07] <mikebo1> un_no
[05:07] <mikebo1> un_operateur1: no
[05:07] <master_tux> jrib: good one
[05:07] <ifti> I got ifstate
[05:07] <rockinchado> does anyone know what it is called if i wanna use the wired connection on my computer with my 360 to connect to the net using my wireless which is connected to the router      so essentially it would be like 360 --> wired --> my computer --> wireless --> internet        ?
[05:07] <ubut> master_tux: i don't
[05:07] <ifti> after doing ls /var/run/network I got ifstate
[05:07] <un_operateur1> !pppoe
[05:07] <ubotu> Setting up an ADSL/PPPoE connection? Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ADSLPPPoE
[05:08] <master_tux> ubut: if you have ubuntu, then you have gnome, just browse through the players
[05:08] <mikebo1> un_operateur1: I tried to follow that, but when I did 'sudo pppoeconf', I got an error
[05:08] <ubut> master_tux: codecs are missing to decode it
[05:09] <un_operateur1> mikebo1, I dont use gnome/kde so i cant walk you through this -- but i seem to recall one of the network utilities in the GUI that was capable of configuring PPPoE ..
[05:09] <ifti> I can delete the file by doing sudo remove /etc/network/interfaces , right?
[05:09] <master_tux> ubut: look at what ubotu said ^
[05:09] <un_operateur1> oooo ifti no no no noooooooo
[05:09] <un_operateur1> dont do that lol
[05:09] <ubut> master_tux: so nowi want to install mp3blaster with livecd
[05:09] <ifti> ok
[05:09] <ifti> not doing that
[05:09] <frogzoo> rockinchado: it's called routing, & you might want to do nat on the linux box depending
[05:09] <un_operateur1> the other file
[05:09] <ifti> sorry I'm quite the novice
[05:09] <un_operateur1> the one in /var/...
[05:09] <ifti> ah
[05:10] <master_tux> ubut: use a live cd for disk recovery, or to sample an  operating system. Dont devote.
[05:10] <un_operateur1> /var/run/network/ifstate
[05:10] <un_operateur1> that one
[05:10] <ifti> gotcha
[05:10] <rockinchado> frogzoo,: aight thanks man i'll look around and see what i can find
[05:10] <craigbass1976> what's the switch to install all the dependencies for a package, or jsut apt-get install does it?
[05:10] <Red-Sox> Can someone please help me compile a program?
[05:10] <ubut> master_tux: its named "desktop-....iso"
[05:10] <un_operateur1> craigbass1976, aptitude install <package> is better
[05:11] <ubut> master_tux: so it aimed to desktop livecd
[05:11] <Red-Sox> This is what I want to compile http://people.freedesktop.org/~krh/akamaru.git/
[05:11] <master_tux> ubut: umm your running this from a live cd, or windows?
[05:11] <frogzoo> craigbass1976: apt takes care of all the dependencies
[05:11] <ubuntu> un_operateur1: thx m8, disabling acpid did the trick, but .. thats prolly a hack, but oh well :)
[05:11] <ubuntu> un_operateur1: this is phlite_kontrol heh
=== ubuntu is now known as phlite_kontrol
[05:11] <un_operateur1> ubuntu, ahh, i was just gonna ask :)
[05:11] <theeren_> first time using ubuntu for me!!
[05:11] <craigbass1976> what's the difference bwtween aptitude and apt?
[05:12] <ubut> master_tux: live cd; i burnt from 'desktop-...iso'
[05:12] <un_operateur1> !aptitude | craigbass1976
[05:12] <fog> hi
[05:12] <ubotu> craigbass1976: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[05:12] <Red-Sox> theeren_: you like?
[05:12] <ttyfscker> any feisty users in here?  i cant seem to get anyone woke up in #ubuntu+1.. got a simple question here.. just need some general feedback before i go posting a bug report
[05:12] <craigbass1976> theeren_, how are you liking it so far?
[05:12] <master_tux> ubut: thats nice, but read what I said earlier
[05:12] <theeren_> great, had some issues getting my widescreen to work
[05:12] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, so it works eh?
[05:12] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: i don't mind hacks, i might have to look into it later, but it works lol, have a good one m8, thx for taking the time to help me out
[05:12] <ezerhoden> Red-Sox, if you are lucky it is as simple as unpacking the source, and ./configure --prefix=/usr then make and finally sudo make install
[05:12] <ifti> ok so deleting the ifstate file had no effect
[05:13] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, it is a hack -- well, kinda -- the service to monitor power mgmt is turned off -- so it doesnt work
[05:13] <theeren_> kinda managed to screw up xorg.conf
[05:13] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: ya, i use my laptop as a media laptop, so i select a .pls and close the lid heh
[05:13] <jrib> Red-Sox: don't install into /usr
[05:13] <ifti> is there some way of returning the network settings to default
[05:13] <wastrel> what's a .pls
[05:13] <ubut> master_tux: you meant can't use 'apt-get install mp3blaster' ?
[05:13] <Red-Sox> ezerhoden: So, first unpack the .tar.gz, then cd to that directory, THEN run "./configure --prefix=/usr" then do "sudo make install"
[05:13] <phlite_kontrol> un_operateur1: but have a good one m8
[05:13] <XiXaQ> Can I use win32 DVD players under wine?
[05:13] <un_operateur1> phlite_kontrol, sure -- will do :)
[05:13] <Red-Sox> Oh
[05:13] <master_tux> ubut: if you know how to do it, then do it
[05:13] <wastrel> ifti: what does  ifconfig eth0  give you?  (don't paste in here, just describe)
[05:13] <fog> how do i know if my video card is 3d capable ?
[05:14] <frogzoo> !appdb | XiXaQ
[05:14] <ubotu> XiXaQ: Appdb is a database of apps & help for programs that run under wine: see http://appdb.winehq.org
[05:14] <ubut> master_tux: i don't konw
[05:14] <ezerhoden> Red-Sox, well, jrib advices not to install to /usr so leave the --prefix part off
[05:14] <jrib> !compile | Red-Sox

[05:15] <jrib> kohr_: have you installed the w32codecs?
[05:15] <untony2> hi
[05:15] <master_tux> ubut: please google before asking questions like that
[05:15] <ezerhoden> Red-Sox, so, unpack, then ./configure then make, then sudo make install
[05:15] <fog> un_operateur1: so if its onboard and it didnt specify the videoram in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg the 3d is not able to work ?

[05:16] <kohr_> jrib is it on the package manager
[05:16] <un_operateur1> fog, well, if it's onboard it probably isnt too good at 3d -- althought it'd work
[05:16] <jrib> kohr_: no, not in default repositories, the restricted formats page tells you

[05:17] <ifti> i got it to work
[05:18] <wastrel> okey dokey  what did you do?
[05:18] <ifti> i had deleted "auto eth0" from the etc/network/interfaces
[05:18] <ifti> so I put it back in
[05:18] <ifti> and then did restart
[05:18] <ifti> and it worked
[05:18] <wastrel> that would do it.
[05:18] <wastrel> you could also have brought it up with   sudo ifup eth0
[05:18] <ubut> un_operateur1: oh neat; where add above line?
[05:18] <ifti> and ifdown, would turn it off?
[05:19] <un_operateur1> Ubut, sorry?

[05:20] <craigbass1976> Anyone used sql-ledger? I've installed it but can't figure out how to fire it up.
[05:20] <un_operateur1> bugs in ruby shouldnt be down to packaging on the part of debian or ubuntu
[05:21] <Red-Sox> jrib: If untarred and cd to that directory, but ./configure doesn't work, any ideas?
[05:21] <XiXaQ> frogzoo, I'm not sure. I followed the guide on the wiki, but I'm still not able to view dvd movies. I thought I'd install a windows player...
[05:21] <jrib> Red-Sox: you probably don't have the dependencies you need.  look for a README or INSTALL file
[05:21] <jrib> Red-Sox: or read the errors from ./configure

[05:25] <master_tux> faery: google it
[05:25] <screechingcat> any epiphany users here ?

[05:25] <ubut> un_operateur1: ?
[05:25] <craigbass1976> emun, yeah, gedit would work too, and better I've found for bigger files
[05:25] <master_tux> ubut: why not go to the site, download the source, build and install!
[05:26] <craigbass1976> Anyone use postgresql?  Is it even remotely like mysql?

[05:35] <Kachingo> Howdy, I just tried to intall ubuntu 6.10 server on my pc, and it doesn't start up the OS. GRUB says starting up, and then it just reboots. Recovery mode does the same. Any ideas why this is happening?
=== nightless_ is now known as nightless
[05:35] <frogzoo> nightless: should be in your monitor manual
[05:36] <ubut> un_operateur1: i don't use dapper ; using daily live 1211
[05:36] <nightless> frogzoo, and if i dont have the manual ^^.. nevermind if it can be found in a manual it can probobly be goooogled, was jsut wondering if there was a command taht got that info
[05:36] <un_operateur1> ubut -- what is that?
[05:36] <advcomp2019> i had it working in 6.06 but when i updated to 6.10 it does not work but then i found a fix but it only worked for 3 restarts
[05:36] <ubut> un_operateur1: i get from cdimage.ubuntu.com
[05:37] <frogzoo> nightless: there's xresprobe in the repos
[05:37] <faeryNatsuki> any kopete user here?
[05:37] <nightless> frogzoo, excellent :)
[05:38] <ubut> un_operateur1: daily-live/current/feisty-desktop-i386.iso
[05:38] <un_operateur1> ubut -- ok, well, if I were you -- i'd use these sources for now -- install your package and then comment them out

[05:39] <Starcraftmazter> whats the linux equivilent of batch files?
[05:39] <Erb> why can't I save to /var/www/  ???
[05:39] <frogzoo> Starcraftmazter: bash scripts
[05:39] <un_operateur1> Starcraftmazter, a shell script
[05:39] <un_operateur1> frogzoo, could be csh or ksh scripts too :)

[05:40] <murali> hi all
[05:41] <murali> can someone plz temme how to run binaries in linux???
[05:41] <frogzoo> Starcraftmazter: man bash, and 'google shell script'
[05:41] <un_operateur1> StaN[Work] , you just lump your commands into a file and save it -- run the script via  --  sh file.sh
[05:41] <frogzoo> murali: open a terminal & type in the path to the command
[05:42] <Starcraftmazter> ok
[05:42] <Starcraftmazter> what about PATH, where on linux do I change that?
[05:42] <un_operateur1> in your shells rc file
[05:42] <un_operateur1> usually ~/.bashrc
[05:42] <frogzoo> Starcraftmazter: unless you're an expert, leave PATH alone
[05:42] <emun> I am confused I was trying to add a line to the /etc/apt/sources.list  but the sudo vi ..... did not open the sources list
[05:42] <Starcraftmazter> I think I'll be right, where bouts is it?
[05:43] <un_operateur1> Starcraftmazter, in ~
[05:43] <un_operateur1> the home folder
[05:43] <lubix_> /dalnet
[05:43] <murali> frogzoo: its actually not a command.. actually i've downloaded the java run time binaries... but i dunno hou to install it on my system... its a .bin file
[05:43] <Starcraftmazter> ok
[05:43] <frogzoo> emun: sudo
[05:43] <ttyfscker> anyone here using feisty able to discuss something rather simple???

[05:43] <ttyfscker> !feisty | un_operateur1
[05:43] <ubotu> un_operateur1: The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule - Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty - Help in #ubuntu+1
[05:44] <ttyfscker> thats why..

[05:44] <foob> why is kubuntu dvd taking 10 hours to download
[05:44] <foob> isnt gettin a distro from bittorrent supposed to be super fast
[05:44] <frogzoo> ttyfscker: -> #ubuntu+1
[05:44] <emun> do you mean did I put in my password
[05:45] <ttyfscker> ppl im already there
[05:45] <HyperHacker> foob, BitTorrent tends to start slow, speed up, then slow down as it finishes
[05:45] <ttyfscker> have been trying to get someone to talk for an hour or two
[05:45] <un_operateur1> ttyfscker, just ask the question dude :)
[05:45] <ttyfscker> and nobody is saying jack sh*t
[05:45] <frogzoo> emun: 'sudo date' - does that work?
[05:45] <HyperHacker> and a 700MB download is going to take while no matter who you get it from
[05:45] <foob> HyperHacker mine hasnt sped up at all, it's been consistently at 40kb/s
[05:45] <foob> for the last few hours
[05:45] <HyperHacker> unless you have one heck of a connection
[05:45] <HyperHacker> you might have a NAT problem then
[05:45] <ttyfscker> my spellcheck in gtk apps like xchat and gaim are not working under feisty.. i have libgtkspell0 and aspell and all the deps installed.. and its just not working
[05:45] <foob> and i have a fast connection capable of 500kb/s on http downloads
[05:45] <ttyfscker> the question is.. can someone else confirm the same thing
[05:45] <murali> frogzoo:actually ther problem is tht i was surfing n on a particular page it asked me to install the missing plugins..since it was not able to install automatically it gave me the link to do it manually... n there u only have binaries or rpm's.. can we install thro rpm's on ubuntu??

[05:50] <Shadowpillar> none of the pixart related kernel modules load it up

[05:50] <un_operateur1> ttyfscker, spellchecker seems to work fine all over here
[05:50] <ttyfscker> un_operateur1:: you in FeistyFawn ?
[05:51] <un_operateur1> aye
[05:51] <craigbass1976> hendrickvp, you don't just type mysql?  I've never run mysql in ubuntu, only fedora and cent
[05:51] <un_operateur1>  dpkg -l | grep -i spell | awk '{print $2}' | xargs
[05:51] <un_operateur1> aspell aspell-en dictionaries-common iamerican ispell libaspell15 libaspell15c2 libenchant1c2a libgtkspell0 libmyspell3c2 myspell-en-gb myspell-en-us
[05:51] <ttyfscker> un_operateur1:: your spell check is working in gaim and xchat?
[05:51] <compir99> simple question. how do u do a recusive chmod but you want to exclude a directory?
[05:51] <ianthepetrock> can i use vmware to run linux from another harddrive?
[05:51] <un_operateur1> ttyfscker, yep
[05:52] <ttyfscker> i have all that crap installed
[05:52] <hendrickvp> I've installed mysql, I'm going through the Admin tools on a mac from mysql
[05:52] <shaslap> anyone have luck getting eclipse to work on edgy
[05:52] <un_operateur1> ttyfscker, maybe its a feature you need to enable somewhere ??
[05:52] <wastrel> ttyfscker:  no idea.  but it's easy enough to install & see.  afaik libgtkspell can use either aspell or ispell
[05:52] <ttyfscker> no i have the feature "checked"
[05:52] <ttyfscker> im using the same /home directory as i had on my other installs
[05:53] <ttyfscker> so everything is pretty much set up the way it works in edgy ;)
[05:53] <craigbass1976> hendrickvp, I don't know then.  I've only interacted with mysql in a command line or with a bash script./
[05:53] <compir99> for example: chmod -R 775 music. how do i exclude for example jones?
[05:53] <kuto> anyone know how to install openmotif?
[05:54] <un_operateur1> compir99, errm   for i in `find /path/to/dir -type d | grep -vi jones`; do chmod 775 $i; done
[05:54] <kuto> how to run openmotif
[05:54] <ttyfscker> ill brb lemme see if this ispell fixed it
[05:54] <un_operateur1> for i in `find /path/to/dir -type d | grep -vi jones`; do chmod -R 775 $i; done
[05:55] <ttyfscker> well that worked whatever i did
[05:55] <ttyfscker> thanks guys
[05:55] <ubut> un_operateur1: then apt-get update && apt-get install mp3blaster /
[05:55] <pi-meson> What's the easiest way to get the debugfs module up and running on a recent dapper install? I could download a new kernel.org kernel and go through the whole build process (with make-kpkg and the like) but is there a faster way?
[05:55] <hendrickvp> craigbass1976 I've had alot of problems when trying to determine wether or not it is running properly. And when I use certain commands I can not execute, I get an error -- not admin--
[05:55] <un_operateur1> ubut -- yeppers
[05:56] <compir99> un_operateur1: work for files & dirs?
[05:56] <ubut> un_operateur1: my man; it is updating
[05:56] <hendrickvp> not a literal not admin but something along those lines
[05:56] <un_operateur1> compir99, that was just for directories -- but doing it recursively
[05:56] <un_operateur1> so yea, it ought to change files under the dirs too
[05:57] <craigbass1976> hendrickvp, so, you ssh into the mysql server, and you can't run mysql commands from that command line?
[05:57] <faeryNatsuki> how can i use custom emoticons in kopete? and how to download and use the one my buddies sent to me?
[05:57] <shaslap> i installed the eclipse package on edgy eft and when i try to run it i get an error of "!MESSAGE NLS missing message: initializer_error in: org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.messages" in the error log
[05:58] <hendrickvp> no, I'm at the command line at the box, and it does not work
[05:58] <Red-Sox[away] > How do i switch to kubuntu? y'know remove all gnome apps and install all kde apps?
[05:58] <craigbass1976> what os is running on the server?
[05:58] <Red-Sox[away] > sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop & sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop ?
[05:58] <refus3d> Red-Sox[away] : sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[05:58] <hendrickvp> ubuntu
[05:58] <refus3d> dont remove ubuntu!!
[05:58] <Red-Sox[away] > refus3d: Yeah but that won't remove all gnome components
[05:58] <ubut> un_operateur1: mp3player installed; i can't press F1 in gnome-terminal
[05:58] <refus3d> why do you want to remove the gnome one?
[05:59] <hendrickvp> might it have something to do with access control
[05:59] <Red-Sox[away] > refus3d: So it's like I installed kubuntu, I don't want all these gnome apps cluttering up my kde desktop
[05:59] <un_operateur1> ubut- errm .. thats unusual
[05:59] <hendrickvp> I seem to have the same problem with other modules
[05:59] <craigbass1976> hendrickvp, what happens when you type mysql?

[06:09] <noiesmo> hemanth,  sudo apt-get install mplayer mplayer-fonts mplayer-skins w32codecs mencoder
[06:09] <gaurav19> un_operateur1, nope, nothing like that
[06:10] <frogzoo> levander: you need both 'adm' & 'admin' - they're used for different things
[06:10] <levander> jrib: but, they're supposed to be two different groups?  It's not like it was called adm back in warty days (when I first installed this machine and have been upgrading ever since) and they changed it at one point to admin, but didn't change my user to be in the admin group?
[06:10] <kitche> eNaq: join #kitchetech

[06:12] <kitche> hendrickvp, did you try to log in remotely after you did it?
[06:12] <hendrickvp> yep
[06:13] <jfassad> hello everybody. is there any way to enabe 3d accel for the Intel GMA X3000 ? Im Running edgy.
[06:13] <gaurav19> un_operateur1, ubuntu did not ask me where to install the bootloader
[06:13] <hendrickvp> this is the error I got
[06:13] <fnf> Hi, is there any tool available to edit the GNOME's Main Menu, I tried looking at the XML config file but there's no documentation about it so I'm not sure where to start.
[06:13] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, sorry -- just had to do something
[06:13] <wastrel> fnf:  alacarte menu editor
[06:13] <nicholaspaul> is there a command to deactivate a wifi adapter?
[06:14] <levander> jrib: I don't even have an admin group on my system
[06:14] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, what i think you need to do now is edit windows c:\boot.ini
[06:14] <hendrickvp> Could not connect to MySQL instance at 192.168.0.33. Error; can't connect to MySQL server on '192.168.0.33' (61) (code 2003)
[06:14] <Madpilot> fnf, Applications->Accessories->Alacarte Menu Editor
[06:14] <jrib> levander: what does your /etc/sudoers look like?
[06:14] <fnf> wastrel:Looks like it isn't inlucded by default in Ubuntu server :) thank you. I'm downloading it.
[06:14] <fnf> Madpilot: Thanks.
[06:14] <hendrickvp> when I ping host I do get a response
[06:14] <gaurav19> un_operateur1, I thought you missed the last message
[06:15] <jrib> levander: adm is for reading stuff in /var/log
[06:15] <frogzoo> nicholaspaul: iwconfig eth0 power off
[06:15] <levander> jrib: this line is in sudoers: levander ALL=(ALL) ALL
[06:15] <Madpilot> fnf, if you started w/ Ubuntu server, then installed ubuntu-desktop, I'd think it would install alacarte too
[06:15] <jrib> levander: ok, then I guess that isn't the issue
[06:15] <cypher1> hendrickvp, is the MySQL started and listening for connections
[06:15] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, err no .. had to attend to something
[06:15] <nicholaspaul> frogzoo: and i imagine 'power on' would turn it on?
[06:15] <levander> jrib: you have an admin group on your box?  there's not even one in /etc/group for me
[06:15] <fnf> Madpilot: I installed gnome by itself :) it's nice to know anyway, thanks.
[06:15] <jrib> levander: yes, i do
[06:15] <hendrickvp> that would be a STATUS in mysql correct?
[06:16] <kitche> hendrickvp, forgot you have to issue mysqladmin flush-privileges command or mysqladmin reload
[06:16] <wastrel> i have admin <3
[06:16] <cypher1> hendrickvp, sorry i do not know of MySQL specifics
[06:16] <jfassad> on edgy alacarte is on System > Preferences > Menu Layout , I belive
[06:16] <kitche> hendrickvp, here is the documentation for mysql http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/index.html
[06:16] <jfassad> or maybe that's not alacarte. not sure.
[06:17] <hendrickvp> nope that is not working
[06:17] <cypher1> hendrickvp, please also try "netstat -an | grep 1433"
[06:17] <fangorious> is there a way to add custom modelines to the ddc info (not the device section in xorg.conf)? the fglrx 8.3x.x drivers vseem to ignore custom modelines in xorg.conf
[06:17] <Ciobin> hi to all
[06:17] <jfassad> So, anyone here using the Intel GMA X3000 video card ?
[06:18] <frogzoo> nicholaspaul: actually, my bad, that just turns off power management - you probly want 'sudo ifdown eth1 / sudo ifup eth1'
[06:18] <advcomp2019> now it is locking up during hibernating
[06:18] <hendrickvp> nothing happens
[06:18] <Ciobin> I've done a fresh installation of ubuntu and now grub dosn't start
[06:18] <Ciobin> how can I do to start my ubuntu?
[06:18] <Flannel> Ciobin: error? or what?
[06:19] <Flannel> !grub | Ciobin, first link, to reinstall grub (so you can boot)
[06:19] <ubotu> Ciobin, first link, to reinstall grub (so you can boot): grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:19] <Ciobin> Flannel: No, cursor pulse only on my monitor. This is the only thing that I see
[06:19] <Ciobin> I've 4 hd
[06:20] <Ciobin> Windows on the 1st and Ubuntu on the 4st
[06:20] <Shadowpillar> I'm using dapper and what appears to be a pixart imaging webcam
[06:20] <un_operateur1> 4st ? :d
[06:20] <Shadowpillar> none of the pixart related kernel modules load it up
[06:20] <Shadowpillar> no /dev/videoX or anything
[06:20] <Ciobin> :) sorry for my english
[06:20] <Shadowpillar> only thing that's detected is the onboard mic
[06:21] <un_operateur1> Ciobin, it's ok -- it's 4th  :)
[06:21] <hendrickvp> when I use tcp in place of 1433,  it is listening
[06:21] <Ciobin> un_operateur1: ok
[06:21] <hendrickvp> but the tcp port 3306 is only local, 127.0.0.1
[06:21] <Shadowpillar> so anyone know?
[06:21] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, that might explain why you cant connect remotely :)
[06:22] <hendrickvp> yeh
[06:22] <hendrickvp> how do I change that?
[06:22] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, i think you need to -- sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority low mysql-server  .. or edit the mysql config file
[06:22] <frogzoo> hendrickvp: change bind interface in /etc/mysql/my.cnf for ips other than localhost
[06:23] <matxxtt> I am having trouble installing VMware tools in kubuntu.. I keep getting a error saying a previous installation has been detected..
[06:23] <hendrickvp> when I try to change a file through ssh, I can load it, but when I goto replace the file on the server it will not allow'
[06:24] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, how are you editing it?
[06:24] <nicholaspaul> thx frogzoo :)
[06:24] <kuto> hi
[06:24] <kuto> how do i change my window manager?
[06:24] <hendrickvp> text editor in os x
[06:25] <advcomp2019> does anyone know how i can fix this problem and if not where can i get help
[06:25] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, the user you logged in as via the ssh servers needs permissions eh
[06:25] <sphorbis> when i try to log on to samba via winxp it just keeps asking me for my user name and password, what am i doing wrong
[06:25] <ubut> bb
[06:25] <matxxtt> I run the command in konsole sudo install vmware-install.pl
[06:25] <un_operateur1> so, you'll need to replace the file as root
[06:25] <wastrel> advcomp2019:  post the question on the ubuntu forums.
[06:26] <hendrickvp> I know, but I can't figure out how to get those permissions
[06:26] <wastrel> www.ubuntuforums.org
[06:26] <un_operateur1> matxxtt, err -- it should be   sudo perl vmware-install.pl
[06:26] <matxxtt> ill try that
[06:26] <un_operateur1> or simply   sudo ./vmware-install.pl
[06:27] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, the permissions should be listed in  ls -l file
[06:27] <kuto> how do i change my window manager?
[06:27] <advcomp2019> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/util-linux/+bug/66637
[06:27] <un_operateur1> kuto, -- in the logon screen -- change "session"
[06:27] <advcomp2019> that is what i have. i had it fixed for 3 restarts
[06:27] <advcomp2019> and now it is back
[06:28] <matxxtt> that doesnt work
=== bl is now known as buddhalover
[06:28] <matxxtt> it says it cant find the script perl
[06:28] <nicholaspaul> In Screen, why is it that the DELETE key doesnt work? I get a msg saying 'Wuff! Wuff!'
[06:28] <hendrickvp> when I type ls -l  I get, total 4 .....next line..... -rw-r--r-- 1 bryan bryan 3515 2006-12-16 21:12 my.cnf
[06:29] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, and are you loggin in as bryan ?
[06:29] <hendrickvp> yes
[06:29] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, i suppose you have a local copy of my.cf right?
[06:30] <un_operateur1> the one you are currently editing i.e.
[06:30] <un_operateur1> ?
[06:30] <hendrickvp> yes
[06:30] <matxxtt> I did try sudo ./vmware-install.pl and it asks the for the password then it says a previous installation was detected.. So I get a failure
[06:31] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, then what you can do is  back the file up with   mv my.cf  my.cf.bak      and put this copy up as my.cf
[06:31] <un_operateur1> matxxtt, do you have a previous installation already on your system?
[06:32] <matxxtt> well I tried to install it before but it didnt work
[06:32] <hendrickvp> the only problem with that is... I can not write anything from my machine that I'm editing on
[06:32] <_tcc> Slight problem, while I was using the gnome-services manager or whatever, it crashed.
[06:32] <_tcc> Now I am unable to use it.
[06:33] <matxxtt> as I cant get 32bit color or a higher res than 1024by 768... I run everything at 1600by 1200
[06:33] <_tcc> "You are not allowed to access the system configuration."
[06:33] <_tcc> For some stupid reason.
[06:33] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, do you have root access at the server?
[06:33] <Flannel> _tcc: probably a lock file somewhere
[06:33] <matxxtt> and at the bottom of the vmware window it says you do not have vmware tools installed
[06:33] <hendrickvp> yes
[06:34] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, and you have no permissions under root too??
[06:34] <_tcc> Flannel, yeah, but where?
[06:34] <_tcc> lol
[06:34] <un_operateur1> i dont get it
[06:34] <hendrickvp> well, I should say that with mysql yes, with ssh no
[06:34] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  can you explain more clearly how you are accessing these files   in what way are you using ssh?
[06:34] <hendrickvp> k
[06:34] <Flannel> _tcc: probably in /etc/
[06:35] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, you cannot edit /etc/mysql/my.cf unless you have root privs ..
[06:35] <hendrickvp> I'm on a mac, using a text editor, the program I'm using is a GUI drag'n'drop called Fugu
[06:35] <un_operateur1> you definitely need root access
[06:35] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  so you're copying the file to your mac with ssh gui prog, then editing on the mac, then copying back over
[06:36] <hendrickvp> yes
[06:36] <kuto> un_operateur1: do you know how to start a session with motif client or start a session with just default X
[06:36] <Flannel> hendrickvp: sudo nano [filename] 
[06:36] <honda> has anyone expirienced an issue where their screensaver is always blank, even when you select another option?
[06:36] <nightless> how do i see the user list on xchat =/
[06:36] <_tcc> what a pain in the ass
[06:36] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  you will have to copy the file back to the remote system to a separate location, the user's home directory probably.
[06:36] <TGPO> nightless: drag the userlist open
[06:37] <matxxtt> This the 3rd time have tried to get a unbuntu distro to work and I cant install a damn thing
[06:37] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  then you will have to use sudo on the remote system to move it to the correct location.
[06:37] <un_operateur1> kuto .. i dunno if i follow you right -- what session is this?? a logon session?
[06:37] <nightless> TGPO, right just dont know where the user list would be to drag it, i figured it was just resized to nothing
[06:37] <hendrickvp> I got yeah
[06:37] <TGPO> nightless: on the right side
[06:37] <nightless> TGPO, ahhh thanks :D
[06:37] <hendrickvp> so I need to edit the permissions this way, for mysql then
[06:38] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, do or dont you have root access on the server?
[06:38] <_tcc> WTF
[06:38] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  the problem is, when you connect to the linux system with ssh, you have the access rights of the user you're logged in as.  this user can read, but not edit the file you are interested in.
[06:38] <kuto> un_operateur1: i want to log on to ubuntu like failsafe Xterm but with a window manager how do i do that?
[06:38] <_tcc> Gnome says I am not allowed to access the system configuration.
[06:38] <_tcc> I need some help.
[06:38] <_tcc> How can I remove this lock?
[06:38] <lubix_> wow
[06:39] <lubix_> i hate screen
[06:39] <kitche> kuto: it's twm is probably what you want but not sure
[06:39] <lubix_> i detached my tty sessions and got all messed up
[06:39] <lubix_> haha
[06:39] <hendrickvp> I don't think so.... When I installed ubuntu, I just asked for a username and I typed in bryan
[06:39] <kuto> kitche: how do i log in with twm
[06:39] <un_operateur1> kuto, usually you install the window manager -- and then change to use it at the logon screen the same way you change to a failsafe xterm or failsafe gnome
[06:39] <Flannel> hendrickvp: that's ok.  You have access as bryan.
[06:39] <Flannel> !sudo | hendrickvp
[06:39] <ubotu> hendrickvp: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:40] <un_operateur1> hendrick -- ok -- you'll need a command line ssh access to the server for this
[06:40] <un_operateur1> i think OS X has command line ssh
[06:40] <spikeb> yes it does
[06:40] <kitche> kuto: did you try the failsafe login think that is twm actually
[06:40] <hendrickvp> yeah one sec I'll pull it up
[06:41] <spikeb> last i saw, failsafe was no WM at all
[06:41] <hendrickvp> I believe it is terminal
[06:41] <hendrickvp> I'll try through it
[06:41] <Ciobin> I'm going to sleep... Tnks to all
[06:41] <un_operateur1> failsafe gnome is a wm, aint it? :)
[06:41] <Flannel> spikeb: there's "rescue console" which is a selection at GRUB, and "failsafe" login (at GDM), which logs you in without startup scripts
[06:42] <hendrickvp> go ahead I'm ready
[06:42] <kitche> spikeb: in X think failsafe is twm, but not sure on ubuntu
[06:42] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, first -- copy the local my.cf to a location on the server
[06:42] <un_operateur1> if you have any writeable location there
[06:42] <eNaq> im back
[06:42] <MSTK> excuse me.  i'm new to Ubuntu.  I currently have this error in my synaptic package manager.  Does anyone mind helping?
[06:42] <un_operateur1> !ask | MSTK
[06:42] <ubotu> MSTK: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:43] <MSTK> oh, heh.  thanks
[06:43] <hendrickvp> k again I'm I newb how do I copy
[06:43] <MSTK> The error details: "E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. "  -- when I run that in the terminal, it says that the command requires Superuser privileges.
[06:43] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, sorry -- copy using your fugu/fogo program :)
[06:43] <Flannel> MSTK: put sudo infront of it
[06:43] <arrenlex> MSTK: Then run it with sudo.
[06:43] <MSTK> oh
[06:43] <MSTK> thanks
[06:43] <arrenlex> !sudo | MSTK
[06:43] <ubotu> MSTK: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:43] <hendrickvp> k
[06:43] <MSTK> ah
[06:43] <MSTK> that's what sudo means
[06:43] <MSTK> i've been typing it before alot
[06:43] <MSTK> I never actually knew what it meant =/  thanks guys.
[06:43] <arrenlex> MSTK: "sudo" = Do as SuperUser.
[06:44] <hendrickvp> so copy from my mac to the server under my home dir.
[06:44] <Flannel> !sudo | MSTK
[06:44] <ubotu> MSTK: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:44] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, that works
[06:44] <un_operateur1> :)
[06:44] <hendrickvp> done
[06:44] <un_operateur1> ok -- now -- in the command line session -- sudo su
[06:44] <Flannel> un_operateur1: no.  Please don't recommend that
[06:44] <hendrickvp> done
[06:44] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Please recommend sudo -i
[06:45] <kitche> eNaq: did you get it working?
[06:45] <MSTK> does anyone have any idea what may have caused the problem?
[06:45] <eNaq> um..
[06:45] <MSTK> it's fixed now, but I want to avoid it in the future
[06:45] <eNaq> lets open a private chat again please.
[06:45] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp,  mv /etc/mysql/my.cf /etc/mysql/my.cf.bak
[06:45] <arrenlex> MSTK: You (or something) interrupted the package installation process as it was happening.
[06:45] <kitche> eNaq: join #kitchetech again
[06:45] <user_> ubuntu 6.10 is running improperly for me, it will return to the login screen intermittently
[06:45] <eNaq> ok. Thank you.
[06:45] <user_> I googled, and found nothing
[06:46] <MSTK> I remember interrupting a package download for automatix (which as I have found is very bug-prone).  But not for synaptics.  Would that affect anything?
[06:46] <hendrickvp> I get a no such file of directory
[06:46] <arrenlex> MSTK: Yes.
[06:46] <Flannel> MSTK: automatix itself is liable to cause it's own slew of problems
[06:46] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, cd /etc/mysql;  ls my.cf
[06:46] <user_> I get the sense that there a package issue somewhere.... a conflict maybe but it nearly impossible for me to run anything without the gdm login screen coming up at exactly the wrong time
[06:47] <arrenlex> MSTK: There's only one way to install .deb packages. If automatix has to install any .debs at all, it had to go through dpkg, and interrupting dpkg produced taht error.
[06:47] <arrenlex> that *
[06:47] <MSTK> ah.  well, thanks guys.  The problem seems to have resolved itself.
[06:47] <user_> even failsafe terminal has returned to login
[06:47] <arrenlex> MSTK: Synaptic is a front-end to apt-get, which itself uses dpkg, so interrupting synaptic will give the same problems.
[06:47] <hendrickvp> k
[06:47] <MSTK> one must wonder why synaptics couldn't just run the command itself?
[06:47] <MSTK> all it needed was a password, right?
[06:47] <un_operateur1> Flannel, arrenlex why not sudo su??
[06:47] <spikeb> that is a good question
[06:47] <user_> so I've deduced there something very wrong at hand
[06:47] <Flannel> un_operateur1: because sudo -i does it, and is safer
[06:48] <un_operateur1> safer how?
[06:48] <user_> any ideas or should I just try some sort of reconfigure for x....
[06:48] <Flannel> un_operateur1: the same reason sudo by itself is safer
[06:48] <eNaq> #kitchetech
[06:48] <eNaq> man
[06:48] <un_operateur1> Flannel, is that it?
[06:48] <kitche> un_operateur1, it will keep a log
[06:49] <hendrickvp> \c
[06:49] <MSTK> hm...I think I just broke synaptics again =/
[06:49] <tonyyarusso> Apache is failing to load.  What log does that go in if an init script fails (even when run manually)?  The console output isn't helpful at all.
[06:49] <eNaq> gaim instand messenger is rather confusing..
[06:49] <MSTK> it says I have a Broken package
[06:49] <MSTK> so what do I do?  uninstall it?
[06:49] <arrenlex> eNaq: What has confused you?
[06:49] <kitche> eNaq: put a / infront of join
[06:49] <lubix_> eNaq: are you serious?
[06:49] <Gumby> tonyyarusso: logs are usually kept in /var/log
[06:49] <eNaq> oh!
[06:49] <eNaq> a/ #kitchetech
[06:49] <tonyyarusso> Gumby: yes, but do you know which?  (nothing obvious)
[06:49] <eNaq> oops
[06:49] <kitche> tonyyarusso, check the apache log it might say something
[06:49] <Gumby> tonyyarusso: um, usually its httpd or apache
[06:49] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: If a script is failing when you run it manually, run it with sh -x to see full debug output from the shell.
[06:49] <hendrickvp> so when I us the CD...... nothing happens just a new line
[06:49] <MSTK> eNaq: have you ever used mIRC?
[06:50] <Gumby> tonyyarusso: fairly "obvious"
[06:50] <un_operateur1> kitche, keep a log of what??
[06:50] <lubix_> it is busy in here all the sudden
[06:50] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: Thanks.
[06:50] <eNaq> im a new to mirc
[06:50] <eNaq> unfortunately..
[06:50] <tonyyarusso> Gumby: Yes, those logs are there, but nothing good in them.
[06:50] <MSTK> Well, I was going to say that these commands are exactly the same as those in mIRC, but I guess that won't help.
[06:50] <kitche> un_operateur1, all the commands the user runs if you do sudo su it won't keep a log since su would have taken over instead
[06:51] <radar1976> dammit
[06:51] <un_operateur1> sudo -i doesnt keep a log of all the commands either -- so whats your point?
[06:51] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: I quote from the Gentoo wiki: Warning: The command 'sudo su -' is both redundant and unnecessary; this information is being provided in spite of the fact that someone needs to be beaten with a cluebat. There are severe security issues with this practice. It's a very bad thing to do. But, if you really are intent on shooting yourself in the head, here's the HOWTO.
[06:51] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, errrrr,, ok :)
=== lubix_ is now known as refus3ed
=== refus3ed is now known as refus3d
[06:52] <hendrickvp> k, so I sudo -i then what?
[06:52] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: " * printf fail"  "fail+ /usr/bin/tput op"  Mean anything to you?
[06:52] <Flannel> hendrickvp: whatever else you needed to run. sudo -i is a replacement for sudo su
[06:52] <Red-Sox> Wow I done it this time
[06:52] <MSTK> sorry guys if this question sounds a bit ignorant.  But Synaptics claims that I have a broken package - sun-java5-bin.  What do I do?  Uninstall?  Reinstall?  Qu hago?
[06:52] <radar1976> I'm having issue with an upgrade
[06:52] <Red-Sox> I have KDE nd Gnome installed
[06:52] <radar1976> http://pastebin.ca/281992
[06:52] <Flannel> MSTK: reinstalling should fix it
[06:53] <radar1976> can somone help
[06:53] <nicholaspaul> Q: i'm trying to rename a file, a commandi made, and i want to hide it. I want to rename it with . at the beginning. how can i ?
[06:53] <MSTK> Flannel - the reinstall command is greyed out
[06:53] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: Not a thing. :)
[06:53] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  cp file.foo  /original/file/location/file.foo
[06:53] <Red-Sox> I ONLY want the Gnome apps, how do I unistall all the KDE apps at once?
[06:53] <TGPO> nicholaspaul: mv filename .filename
[06:53] <Flannel> MSTK: you were installing java via autoamtix?
[06:53] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: "printf" prints things. So that line means the shell is printing "fail".
[06:53] <nicholaspaul> TGPO: Cool.. thx !!
[06:53] <foob> crazy talk
[06:53] <hendrickvp> okay, I need to fix my permissions so that I can access mysql
[06:53] <wastrel> TGPO:  mv -i is probably better, just in case.
[06:53] <Flannel> MSTK: then remove completely.  And reinstall java by hand
[06:53] <Flannel> !java | MSTK
[06:53] <ubotu> MSTK: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[06:53] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: Which means that the script didn't crash; some logic in the script is making it print that.
[06:53] <MSTK> Flannel - no, I was marking Totem packages via synaptics.  While marking a conflicting packag it crashed by itself
[06:53] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  why do you need to fix your permissions?
[06:53] <TGPO> wastrel: huh?
[06:54] <MSTK> no, I didn't touch autmatix
[06:54] <Flannel> MSTK: alright, well, remove it completely anyway.  Then you can install it again later
[06:54] <wastrel> TGPO:  in case a .filename already exists it won't be silently overwritten.
[06:54] <MSTK> ah.  thanks
[06:54] <wastrel> TGPO:  just in case
[06:54] <hendrickvp> how do I fix my permissions?
[06:54] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: what init script is this?
[06:54] <TGPO> wastrel: ah I see
[06:54] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: /etc/init.d/apache2
[06:55] <TGPO> wastrel: I forget that others dont alias safety nets in
[06:55] <wastrel> hendrickvp:  what permissions?   the permissions to write the file?
[06:55] <Flannel> hendrickvp: chances are your permissions aren't broken, 99% of the time changing permissions/owners just breaks stuff more
[06:55] <hendrickvp> lol
[06:56] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: can't stop it either.
[06:56] <hendrickvp> Well how do I get mysql to listen then on all ips, not just local
[06:56] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: killall can stop anything ;)
[06:56] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: My own apache2 doesn't contain anything like it. Have you modified it? Could you pastebin the script?
[06:56] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, it's simple -- you change bind-address in /etc/mysql/my.cf
[06:56] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: No, it's not running.  I mean the stop script also fails.
[06:56] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: sure
[06:57] <hendrickvp> so I've opened that file, and I can just set the bind address to % correct?
[06:58] <un_operateur1> you need to set it to 0.0.0.0
[06:58] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37506/
[06:58] <hendrickvp> k
[06:58] <kd7swh> how can I improve lag in my irc client
[06:59] <MSTK> i'll probably be reprimanded by an ubuto response, but...how do I get DVD playback capabilities?  Sorry if it's a simple answer.
[06:59] <hendrickvp> so I've saved that, I'm copying into my home file in the server
[06:59] <TGPO> kd7swh: get a better ISP
[06:59] <kd7swh> TGPO very funny
[06:59] <Flannel> !dvd | MSTK: ubotu response is hardly a reprimand
[06:59] <ubotu> MSTK: ubotu response is hardly a reprimand: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[06:59] <kd7swh> I know that
[06:59] <hendrickvp> now, how do I move the my.cnf file to the /etc/mysql/ dir
[07:00] <kd7swh> TGPO, I am on an academic network
[07:00] <gaurav19> un_operateur1 hi again, this time I am quite distraught... Once again, I tried doing the most common sensical thing.. the partitions and swap space set up .. I started the ubuntu disk and did an "install" everything went fine and it displayed the "installing" dialog, but then on restart I did not find anything on the partition
[07:00] <hendrickvp> and overwrite the current my.cnf?
[07:00] <TGPO> kd7swh: ah you took that as sarcasm, its not. a better connection is your only recourse
[07:00] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: No; it matches mine. Hmm.
[07:00] <gaurav19> un_operateur1 I am doing something very wrong, I guess you are the only one who can help
[07:00] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: all right, what other files can we check?
[07:00] <un_operateur1> hendrickvp, in the command line session --- under sudo -i (or otherwise) .. cp -vi ~/my.cf /etc/mysql/my.cf
[07:00] <hendrickvp> k
[07:00] <kd7swh> TGPO, not sarcasm just a no brainer
[07:01] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, how have you arrived at the conclusion that there is nothing on the partition?
[07:02] <hendrickvp> cp: cannot stat '/root/my.cf' : no such file or dir
[07:02] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: I have no idea, sorry. = / I don't even run apache anymore.
[07:02] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, was it this page you were quoting from earlier?? http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_SUDO_SU_-_in_X11
[07:02] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: Uh oh
[07:02] <kitche> hendrickvp: sudo -i probably puts you in /root
[07:02] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: beyond reinstalling all the apache packages, there's no more advice I can offer you. Sorry. = /
[07:02] <un_operateur1> sorry hendrickvp  -- cp -vi /home/<user>/my.cf /etc/mysql/my.cf
[07:03] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Yes.
[07:03] <un_operateur1> where <user> is probably bryan in your case
[07:03] <Flannel> tonyyarusso: you might try asking in #apache, theyve gotten the job done for me in the past
[07:03] <hendrickvp> same error
[07:03] <hendrickvp> this is weird
[07:03] <tonyyarusso> Flannel: I already asked.  No response yet.
[07:03] <MSTK> flannel & others - thanks for the help.  but when I enter "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh" into the terminal as the instructions say, the terminal responds "command not found".
[07:04] <MSTK> i'm guessing that entering a path =/= a command
[07:04] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, errm -- "sudo su -" is redundant in the case of gentoo because they can just use su - .. but su - has no effect in ubuntu and thats why we need a sudo
[07:04] <Flannel> MSTK: no, that's a command, with the full path.  I don't know what to tell you, I've never installed DVD stuff
[07:04] <ashley_> hey
[07:04] <gaurav19> un_operateur1, in windows env: I see 18.5 Gb total and 18.4 GB free - i don't see athing there, it can not be that windows is unable to see anything
[07:05] <spikeb> MSTK: the path is wrong for 6.10. it's /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-ss.sh
[07:05] <tonyyarusso> Flannel: Any other tricks to get useful output?
[07:05] <arrenlex> MSTK: Put "sh" between sudo and the path. That's the location to a shell script.
[07:05] <ashley_> does anyone know why the sound in ubuntu isn't as loud as it is in windows, and how to change it?
[07:05] <MSTK> spikeb & arrenlx - thanks, I'll try that
[07:05] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, dont count on windows telling you the size of a unix partition .. windows cannot read unix partitions
[07:05] <MSTK> ashley_ I'm guessing you already tried turning up your speakesr?
[07:05] <ashley_> yup
[07:06] <kitche> ashley_: either with sudo alsamixer or by the volume controls in your window manager
[07:06] <TGPO> ashley_: have you turned up the volume using the volume control?
[07:06] <ashley_> yes I have TGPO
[07:06] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, I'm guessing ubuntu has installed fine and all you need to do now is on this page here -- http://www.geocities.com/epark/linux/grub-w2k-HOWTO.html
[07:06] <Flannel> un_operateur1: please give wiki pages (!grub) instead of random other sites, when possible.
[07:06] <radar1976> http://pastebin.ca/281992
[07:06] <gaurav19> un_operateur1, I suspected that, but was too confused, so I asked you. What do I do next, put ubuntu entry into boot.ini ? i guess i need the entry details
[07:06] <ashley_> Its at full blast but its not as loud as it is in windows
[07:06] <eviltwin> hi
[07:07] <Flannel> gaurav19: you'll probably want to install grub (it can boot to windows and linux)
[07:07] <un_operateur1> Flannel, it's no random other page -- it's one i count on :)
[07:07] <Flannel> !grub | gaurav19, first link gives you methods, and options
[07:07] <ubotu> gaurav19, first link gives you methods, and options: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[07:07] <eviltwin> I'm just setting up a 32 bit chroot on my x64 system and I was wondering where the gnome themes are kept on my x64 installation so that I can link them to the corresponding folder on my chroot so that the gnome apps look nice
[07:07] <eviltwin> qt info is also welcome, since I have skype installed in the chroot
[07:08] <MSTK> Sorry, guys.  I've tried "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-ss.sh", "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-ss.sh", and "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-ss.sh".
[07:08] <MSTK> It says "command not found" for the first one (sudo [path] ) and "can't open [path] " for the other two (sudo sh [path] )
[07:08] <croxis> i'm trying to use grub4dos on a floppy to install the server edition of ubuntu from a hard drive (short story: booting from cd doesn't work so I copied the cd to harddisk on a different computer).  grub4dos isn't loading the partition.  any help will be most appricated
[07:08] <MarcN> MSTK: is the file there?
[07:08] <gaurav19> thanks un_operateur, Flannel and ubotu..i will try out these
[07:08] <Flannel> MSTK: try cd /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/ (no need for sudo) then 'ls' to see what files *are* there
[07:09] <arrenlex> MSTK: I told you, put "sh" between sudo and the path.
[07:09] <MSTK> arrenlex - I did.  And it says "can't open [path] "
[07:09] <arrenlex> MSTK: I don't see any sh in any of those three commands.
[07:09] <MarcN> MSTK: it is install-css.sh (you have a typo)
[07:10] <MSTK> ah.  I copied & pasted wrong.  I ended up pasting the same thing three times
[07:10] <MSTK> but yes, I did indeed put sh between sudo and the command
[07:10] <Flannel> MSTK: when in doubt, tab complete ;)
[07:13] <kd7swh> lag...
[07:13] <Kwipper> Hello. I am a windows user and I want to try booting the live CD of ubuntu on my 2GB flash drive.
[07:13] <Kwipper> I copied the ISO files directly to the flash drive, and I can't get it to boot from my flash drive. It says "Boot Error"

[07:14] <vanberge> whoa
[07:14] <ashley_> lol
[07:14] <MSTK> that's odd.
[07:14] <MSTK> glitch in the matrix?
[07:14] <arrenlex> michael20la: ls | grep -v <filename> | xargs chmod 777

[07:14] <un_operateur1> stoopid kids
[07:14] <jughead> mass exodus
[07:14] <MarcN> michael20la: you can put something together with find . -iname '*.c' -printf "chmod 777 %p\n" |  grep -v onefile.c | sh    or such (didn't try it)
[07:14] <michael20la> wow
[07:14] <arrenlex> ...oh, he's gone. xD
[07:14] <eviltwin> netsplit :P
[07:14] <eviltwin> ahhh
[07:14] <MSTK> yay!  DVD playback gone!  one less thing I have to switch over to Windows to do.
[07:14] <Kwipper> Hello. I am a windows user and I want to try booting the live CD of ubuntu on my 2GB flash drive. I copied the ISO files directly to the flash drive, and I can't get it to boot from my flash drive. It says "Boot Error" What do I need to do?
[07:14] <radar1976> grrr I can't get past this error
[07:14] <radar1976> http://pastebin.ca/281992
[07:14] <MSTK> Kwipper - you either have to burn the CD or mount it to a virtual drive
[07:14] <arrenlex> michael20la: Oh, maybe not. I tried mine. Go to your directory, and use "ls | grep -v <filename> | xargs chmod <hex>"
[07:14] <radar1976> someone help?
[07:15] <MSTK> via daemon or alcohol or something
[07:15] <Flannel> Kwipper: believe you need to extract the files in the ISO to the drive, not copy the iso itself
[07:15] <Kwipper> okay
[07:15] <arrenlex> Kwipper: You can't do it like that. It's a lot more difficult to set up a bootable USB stick than it is a CD.
[07:15] <Kwipper> I did that
[07:15] <Flannel> !install | Kwipper
[07:15] <ubotu> Kwipper: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[07:15] <Flannel> Kwipper: first link there should have a howto for USB booting
[07:15] <Kwipper> I extracted the ISO files and copied them to the HD
[07:15] <Kwipper> err
[07:15] <MSTK> I'd personally just burn the CD so it can be used as a tool for proselytizing.
[07:16] <Kwipper> I don't have any blank cd's
[07:16] <Kwipper> All I got is a USB drive
[07:16] <_james> what's the latest version of ubuntu?
[07:16] <radar1976> !version
[07:16] <ubotu> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[07:16] <MSTK> Edgy Eft, 6.10
[07:16] <spikeb> _james: 6.10
[07:16] <_james> oh.. im on version 5.10 how to upgrade to 6.10?
[07:16] <michael20la> arrenlex: thx it worke
[07:16] <arrenlex> !upgrade | _james
[07:16] <ubotu> _james: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[07:16] <spikeb> radar1976: download a courier-authdaemon package and install it, then try what you're doing
[07:17] <radar1976> I still have 830 packages to install... How to I get past this error
[07:17] <radar1976> I have the deb package
[07:17] <spikeb> use dpkg to install it heh
[07:17] <Kwipper> Wait a minute
[07:17] <Kwipper> You want me to use a virtual drivE?
[07:17] <MSTK> Oh, I just realized something.  Does mounting the installation iso file to a virtual drive via Daemon (etc.) work for a Live CD boot?
[07:17] <MSTK> I thought so at first
[07:17] <Kwipper> How do I get the virtual drive to boot in DOS?
[07:17] <MSTK> but then I realized that virtual drives aren't on
[07:17] <MSTK> when you reboot
[07:17] <MSTK> so I'm not sure.
[07:18] <MSTK> Anyone know how I can get the USB driver for my Yamaha Keyboard to work on Linux?  The distributor never included a linux version
[07:18] <Oni-Dracula> does alsa scale down audio quality under certain circumstances?
[07:19] <Flannel> _james: make sure you upgrade through dapper (5.10 to 6.06 then to 6.10), you can't go from 5.10 straight to 6.10
[07:22] <MSTK> can anyone help me?  I have a keyboard that requires a USB driver, but the distributor only included a windows version.  Is there a workaround?
[07:22] <arrenlex> MSTK: If your question is "how do I use a Windows driver with Linux", you don't.
[07:22] <arrenlex> MSTK: If your question is "is there a Linux driver available for this thing", google is your best bet.
[07:23] <vanberge> MSTK, normally you would just have to change something in your pc's bios.  like 'enable usb keyboard support'
[07:23] <vanberge> shouldnt need a driver for a keyboard
[07:23] <MSTK> I needed it for Windows
[07:23] <vanberge> MSTK, does your keyboard light up?
[07:23] <arrenlex> vanberge: He said earlier it's a Yamaha keyboard, i.e. music. Not typing.
[07:23] <vanberge> eh... sorry
[07:23] <MSTK> oh, sorry
[07:23] <MSTK> didn't make that clear second time
[07:23] <mm2000> how can i make .mov work in mplayer?
[07:24] <MSTK> I keep on forgetting the ambiguity between a music keyboard and a typing keyboard.

[07:24] <_james> hello help pls. how to mount to my windows drive?
[07:24] <arrenlex> mm2000: Uh... more to the point, you have to install the w32codecs package.
[07:24] <arrenlex> _james: Mount read-only, or mount read-write?
[07:24] <mm2000> arrenlex: ok, with apt-get?
[07:24] <arrenlex> _james: read-only is easier.
[07:25] <arrenlex> mm2000: You'll need to enable the seveas repository.
[07:25] <arrenlex> !seveas
[07:25] <spikeb> there's almost no need for w32codecs nowadays
[07:25] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[07:25] <spikeb> real soon it can be done away with.
[07:25] <arrenlex> spikeb: Why so?
[07:25] <spikeb> arrenlex: free software implementations of said codecs
[07:25] <_james> i remember before there's this command fstab sumthing..
[07:25] <arrenlex> spikeb: For what codecs?
[07:25] <clayg> spikeb, really? awsome i am in need of them, give me some examples
[07:25] <arrenlex> _james: Mount read-only, or mount read-write?
[07:26] <spikeb> arrenlex: almost all of them - ffmpeg even has wmv9 support nowadays
[07:26] <clayg> I thought for sure there was a huge need for them and they are a major PITA for linux users, specially while trying to view pages with wmv content
[07:26] <clayg> but looks like you got it covered, tell me the packages i need to install for them
[07:26] <spikeb> clayg: it's still needed in the current release of ubuntu, but as i said - soon :)
[07:26] <MSTK> So there are no ways to use windows drivers on a linux?  Say like, a driver version of Wine?
[07:26] <clayg> ffmpeg? will it integrate in FF so i can view porn from 89.com? the free movies?
[07:27] <spikeb> clayg: the version of ffmpeg that ubuntu has doesn't do wmv9 iu dont think, so you're out of luck for now
[07:27] <_james> How to unzip "bzip2" format and "gzip"?
[07:27] <clayg> oh i guess i figured "almost no use for w32 codecs these days" meant something diff
[07:27] <clayg> i didnt take it to mean "no other alternative"
[07:28] <sosdiode> hi
[07:28] <sosdiode> how are we
[07:28] <spikeb> clayg: what i meant was that verys oon there won't be any use :)

[07:29] <clayg> spikeb, sorry, just frustrated about the codec situation
[07:29] <arrenlex> clayg: You are morally opposed to watching porn with non-free codecs?
[07:29] <epagoge> there's a codec situation!? O_O
[07:29] <radar1976> ok  I don't want courier server
[07:29] <spikeb> clayg: if you install w32codecs that should take care of it
[07:29] <clayg> sudo apt-get install w32codecs
[07:29] <clayg> ?
[07:29] <clayg> are there some specifics?
[07:29] <clayg> and is there a winrar type version
[07:29] <spikeb> that should be enough
[07:29] <anorexicpillow> is edgy really that unreliable?
[07:30] <clayg> i need something for some rars
[07:30] <spikeb> and rar is in multiverse

[07:30] <radar1976> How to I get rid of this stupid upgrade issue
[07:30] <spikeb> clayg: install unrar and rar
[07:30] <clayg> anorexicpillow, i dunno, tried it a month or so ago, very slow
[07:30] <clayg> on a core 2 duo
[07:30] <anorexicpillow> wow really? all ive read is how much faster it is
[07:30] <elljay> does ubuntu install on an imac?
[07:30] <TGPO> clayg are you running 32 bit or 64?
[07:30] <anorexicpillow> yah that could be
[07:30] <_james> arrenlex: what's the difference between read-only and read-write?
[07:30] <anorexicpillow> i believe so elljay
[07:31] <arrenlex> _james: You don't understand what the difference between read-only and read-write is? o_O
[07:31] <spikeb> elljay: it should
[07:31] <arrenlex> _james: In one case, you cannot write to the partition.
[07:31] <arrenlex> Is this not obvious?
[07:31] <epagoge> arrenlex: maybe he wants to understand at what level the read-onlyness happens? :)
[07:31] <amicrawle> what is the file i can preview in konqoro   my video files and music ?
[07:32] <epagoge> it would be neat if hard drives had a write-protect tabs
[07:32] <arrenlex> _james: Write on Linux is still "experimental" and harder to set up... it might (but probably won't) corrupt your filesystem. Read-only is super easy to set up (you don't even have to install anything) and is perfectly safe.
[07:32] <amicrawle> it use to index the video and show pic of what they were

[07:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ntfs3g - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:32] <un_operateur1> hmm
[07:33] <arrenlex> !ntfs-3g | _james, un_operateur1
[07:33] <ubotu> _james, un_operateur1: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions.

[07:33] <lufis> Is there anywhere i can get the new version of vlc pre-compiled?
[07:33] <epagoge> does ubuntu have an installer that can do what debootstrap does, but that setse up the install properly? :)
[07:33] <HyperHacker> so...
[07:33] <anorexicpillow> I have a question... I want to post a video to youtube which will just be a few mp3s and a picture slideshow. It was really easy on XP but I cant get it to work on Ubuntu.. any ideas?
[07:33] <HyperHacker> I put that TV card and a different network card back in
=== nightless is now known as nightless|afk
[07:33] <arrenlex> anorexicpillow: Can't get what to work, exactly?
[07:33] <ajax4> Hey guys...I just installed Edgy and the screen is totally blank when it starts up and shuts down. Anyone know how to fix this?
[07:33] <HyperHacker> hangs again at "Loading hardware drivers"
[07:33] <epagoge> ajax4: try booting into text-mode
[07:34] <Otsuko> hello all
[07:34] <HyperHacker> apparently it won't start with _any_ network card
[07:34] <amicrawle> i use kde guys
[07:34] <anorexicpillow> well ive tried kino and that didnt seem to accept the mp3s
[07:34] <epagoge> ajax4: i think there's a kernel paramter for that...
[07:34] <HyperHacker> also, serial mice don't work
[07:34] <arrenlex> anorexicpillow: Ah! Making the movie. Yeah, that's going to be a problem.
[07:34] <amicrawle> not with main actor
[07:34] <Otsuko> Um... I had a question about dual booting...
[07:34] <ajax4> epagoge: It eventually starts up normally...any idea what config files to change?
[07:35] <anorexicpillow> lol so... a problem that isnt possible to fix
[07:35] <arrenlex> anorexicpillow: firstly, linux has a lot of trouble with mp3 and proprietary codecs in general.
[07:35] <Kwipper> So... there is absolutly NO way of getting Ubuntu Live to boot off of a USB drive?
[07:35] <epagoge> ajax4: well, kernel paramters are stored in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:35] <epagoge> ajax4: because grub is the program that loads the kernel
[07:35] <arrenlex> anorexicpillow: I'm not familiar with kino, but if it can theoretically be used for what you're trying to use it for, try feeding it oggs or even wavs.
[07:35] <Otsuko> It has to deal with with OS default setting
[07:35] <ajax4> epagoge: Okay, any idea what to look for?
[07:35] <Otsuko> setdefault to be exact in grub
[07:35] <arrenlex> anorexicpillow: If kino fails, cinelerra is a professional-standard (read: extremely powerful but insanely hard to use) movie editor for Linux which you can try.
[07:35] <anorexicpillow> okay ill try different formats of audio :)
[07:35] <epagoge> ajax4: i did a quick google and i didn't find anything..
[07:36] <anorexicpillow> okay is that available on synaptic?
[07:36] <arrenlex> !cinelerra | anorexicpillow
[07:36] <epagoge> ajax4: basically, i think the problem is that the kernel is going into framebuffer mode when it starts (which manes instead of using text-mode, it initializes a high-res graphics screen and draws onto it with its own fonts)
[07:36] <ubotu> anorexicpillow: cinelerra is a video editor and compositor. Install instructions can be found on http://cvs.cinelerra.org/getting_cinelerra.php#ubuntu
[07:36] <anorexicpillow> thanks
[07:36] <arrenlex> anorexicpillow: "install instructions" means no. xD

[07:36] <anorexicpillow> hah so i figured :P
=== Echtor2oo3 is now known as Echtor`off
[07:36] <epagoge> ajax4: and i'm assuming that the reason your screen is blank is that the graphics-mode isn't setup right for your monitor
[07:37] <epagoge> ajax4: (because framebuffer isn't that smart about monitors)
[07:37] <anorexicpillow> thanks for you help ill go try and make this work
[07:37] <pbelau> hey, does anyone know where the "new login" menu went in ubuntu 6.06 ?
[07:37] <ajax4> epagoge: Could it be fixed with a changed setting in the BIOS?
[07:37] <pbelau> i'd like to be able to graphically login as two users at once without starting gdm from the commandline
[07:37] <epagoge> ajax4: you could test if the problem is the graphics mode by hooking up a monitor that you know can handle high resolutions and high refresh rates
[07:38] <epagoge> ajax4: (unless you already have that kind of monitor ... )
[07:38] <pbelau> does anyone know ?
[07:38] <ajax4> epagoge: Hehe, sorry only one monitor to use.
[07:38] <epagoge> ajax4: is it that kind of monitor?
[07:38] <epagoge> ajax4: that could narrow down the problem
[07:39] <proqesi> how do I set my keymapping to dvorak before xdm runs?
[07:39] <ajax4> epagoge: It's a standard 21" CRT.
[07:39] <epagoge> hrmm
[07:39] <epagoge> so, explain what you see when it's booting
[07:40] <epagoge> it's like: 1) BIOS POST screen...
[07:40] <epagoge> then.. ?
[07:40] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: fixed
[07:40] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: Hurrah! What did you do?
[07:40] <ajax4> epagoge: POST screen a few words, then completely back. No Ubuntu logo, progress bar, nothing. Then it waits a minute then GDM logo screen comes up.
[07:40] <ajax4> (completely black)
[07:40] <epagoge> ajax4: ok yeah, that's gotta be the framebuffer resolution
[07:40] <epagoge> oh, that's easy to change actually
=== Red-Sox is now known as Red-Sox[away] 
[07:41] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: Well, a) fixed permissions on the digest password file, b) LOADED the digest module (*THWACK*), c) fixed a syntax error - v1.3 docs for v2.2 server is a no-no.
[07:42] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: All those things mean very little or nothing to be, but I offer you my sincere congratulations :)
[07:42] <arrenlex> be -> me
[07:42] <ajax4> pbelau: Do you have an option under system tools called "New Login"?
[07:42] <ajax4> epagoge: Easy to change?
[07:42] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: Thanks.  Now time for bed, after that minor panic.
[07:43] <epagoge> ajax4: haha.. hold on
[07:43] <epagoge> i'm just finding it
[07:43] <arrenlex> pbelau: I'm confused. Can you explain more thoroughly what exactly you are trying to do?
[07:43] <epagoge> google doesn't know where the kernel paramters are listed :\
[07:43] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: (It's SSL & authentication stuff)
[07:43] <pbelau> i found it
[07:43] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: Oh. I'd never messed with that.
[07:43] <pbelau> it moved from system tools -> new login to...
[07:43] <ajax4> pbelau: I think that should take care of what you want to do.
[07:43] <pbelau> system -> quit
[07:43] <pbelau> it's in system -> quit now
[07:44] <pbelau> which is a bit confusing
[07:44] <arrenlex> tonyyarusso: My own short-lived apache server consisted of "hello, me, here are the files you uploaded to this directory at home earlier. I hope they are useful to you. :) <dirlist>"
[07:44] <wastrel> pbelau:  sortof like start->shutdown
[07:44] <clayg> TGPO, i am not sure, i think i'm running 64 bit i just installed the smp kernel
[07:44] <wastrel> the things we do to make things "user friendly"...
[07:44] <tonyyarusso> arrenlex: hehe
[07:44] <clayg> TGPO, Also this is a core 2 duo, which should i run
[07:44] <pbelau> wastrel, it'd be even friendlier if it booted up immediately
[07:45] <pbelau> there's a bug in the LVM configuration for 6.06
[07:45] <TGPO> clayg: you dont remember which you installed?
[07:45] <proqesi> clayg: core2duo is 32bit (i386)
[07:45] <pbelau> causes the system to fail while mounting the root filesystem
[07:46] <arrenlex> clayg: smp != 64-bit. You can have 32-bit with two cores, 64-bit with one core, and any combination thereof. They are unrelated. smp = multi-core processor.
[07:46] <vanberge> whats the package required for basic compiling, etc... base utils or something right?

[07:47] <arrenlex> Capslock118: The rule for Linux is that something either works better than in Windows or does not work at all. :)
[07:47] <Oni-Dracula> Capslock118, it's probably because linux is better at handling memory than windows

[07:48] <vanberge> lol... arrenlex too funny
[07:48] <clayg> arrenlex, proqesi ,i thought core duo was 32 bit and core 2 duo was 64bit, or AMT64
[07:48] <clayg> ?
[07:48] <epagoge> ajax4: ok, found it!
[07:48] <clayg> yeah http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_2_duo
[07:48] <arrenlex> clayg: Oh, you are correct. Instruction Set: EM64T
[07:49] <arrenlex> clayg: Yes, that's where I came from.
[07:49] <epagoge> ajax4: add this as a kernel boot parameter: "video=800x600-16@60"
[07:49] <clayg> ok, so for this is the smp kernel the best
[07:49] <epagoge> ajax4: that's 800x600 mode, 16-bit colour, 60hz refresh rate
[07:49] <clayg> or is there like a special , dual core, 64 bit kernel
[07:49] <arrenlex> clayg: smp and 64-bit.
[07:49] <clayg> point is i dont feel like im running at 2.0ghz X 2
[07:49] <damageDOn1> Can someone help me with a problem with my mic in edgy?
[07:49] <arrenlex> clayg: -generic should take care of it all unless I miss my guess.

[07:50] <arrenlex> clayg: Please pastebin the contents of /proc/cpuinfo
[07:50] <clayg> surely not i hope
[07:50] <clayg> ok
[07:50] <clayg> gimme a second

[07:51] <arrenlex> clayg: cpu MHz    : 997.867
[07:51] <clayg> uname -m or -a?
[07:51] <arrenlex> clayg: You're right, that sure doesn't sound like 2GHZ.
[07:51] <clayg> that sucks man
[07:51] <proqesi> clayg: laptop or deskop?

[07:52] <arrenlex> clayg: Install linux-image-generic for the -generic kernel.
[07:52] <clayg> ok, can i just apt-get a new one, or do i need to like down load the 64bit distro?
[07:52] <arrenlex> clayg: And reboot into it.
[07:52] <clayg> is the generic better you think ?
[07:52] <iami89> who there know about method to install NVIDIA driver in UBUNTU( for geforce 4 mx 440 agp4x 128mb)
[07:52] <arrenlex> clayg: Than 386? Of course. 386es are pre-pentium-I machines.
[07:53] <TGPO> clayg: avoid the 64bit distro like the plague
[07:53] <proqesi> clayg: when you're not plugged in the processor will scale down too
[07:53] <clayg> hey one thing . there is a way to see a graph , similar to the windows type when you hit ctrl alt delete?
[07:53] <clayg> but i cant rememebr how to get into it
[07:53] <clayg> wait actually i installed the smp kernel
[07:53] <clayg> havent rebooted
[07:54] <arrenlex> clayg: On modern cpus, you will not notice a difference between 32-bit and 64-bit under normal desktop use. It only comes out when you have special requirements, like >4GB RAM, or in heavy calculations.
[07:54] <clayg> lemme reboot and see how that does
[07:54] <arrenlex> clayg: I advise you to stick with 32-bit. A lot less headaches.
[07:54] <clayg> ill be right back
[07:54] <proqesi> or in games
[07:54] <clayg> if i stick to 32 bit does that mean im going to run at 2 ghz?

[07:54] <ubotu> iami89: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:54] <HyperHacker> games = heavy calculations ;-)
[07:54] <proqesi> or 3d or video editing
[07:54] <clayg> it almost seems like 99 percent of the time someone would be better of with a p4 3.0ghz
[07:54] <arrenlex> clayg: 32-bit\64-bit will not affect your processor speed.
[07:54] <clayg> then this expensive cpu that doesn't even run at speeds computers would do 5 years ago
[07:55] <clayg> 5-6 years ago i built a 2.4ghz desktop.  I am going to be mad if i find out my new "kick as$" notebook can't keep up with it
[07:55] <arrenlex> clayg: hertz are not a good computing speed benchmark. They do not transfer across different architectures.
[07:55] <iami89> i tried but after install my system crash

[07:55] <clayg> is thre a benchmark app?
[07:55] <clayg> i want to try it now
[07:56] <clayg> then after the reboot/new kernel
[07:56] <clayg> then ill goto the generic and get a good comparison
[07:56] <arrenlex> clayg: Uh... linpack is the only one I know of because it's used to measure supercomputers.
[07:56] <arrenlex> clayg: I don't know if it even works on regular machines.

[07:57] <Shadowpillar> it's a gigaware usb webcam (radioshack)
[07:57] <arrenlex> clayg: In any case, benchmarks will typically only measure one aspect of your computer. When you use your machine, you use a variety of things. A fast processor with a tiny amount of ram will be horribly slow, for example. Your computer's perceived "speed" depends on clock speed, bus width, ram, hard disk RPM, network latency... all sorts of things.

[08:02] <arrenlex> Shadowpillar: Is the chipset supported?
[08:02] <HyperHacker> fixed it by removing a network card
[08:02] <Shadowpillar> arrenlex: should be
[08:02] <damageDOn1> I have a asked a question. Nobody is helping me either...
[08:02] <HyperHacker> tried it with another card, same thing, so removed that one too
[08:02] <Shadowpillar> unless it's a new chipset
[08:02] <arrenlex> Shadowpillar: Why should it be?

[08:07] <niall> or is it automatic?
[08:07] <damageDOn1> TGPO: I'm running Gnome and Beryl
[08:08] <arrenlex> revolutionstudio: Because you've not saved your password in your account options.

[08:14] <epagoge> ajax4: yes, you can put it on the kernel line.. you can even actually do that at boot-time in the grub menu -- grub lets you edit all those menu.lst parameters at boot
[08:14] <clayg> ok back
[08:14] <clayg> you guys still here
[08:14] <clayg> going into xchat was fast as fk
[08:14] <jughead> yeah I don't know... is gaim really all that good for irc?
[08:15] <jughead> I'm a xchat user myself
[08:15] <revolutionstudio> well i dont know...is there any other programs that will run yahoo aim and irc all in one?
[08:15] <arrenlex> wall86: apt-get install powersaved
[08:15] <epagoge> ajax4: you gotta watch out though -- ubuntu rewrites menu.lst whenever you install a new kernel -- so once you know what video= setting to use, put it in the "kopt=" setting higher up in the file
[08:15] <arrenlex> clayg: Still here.
[08:15] <proqesi> revolutionstudio: lots
[08:15] <epagoge> ajax4: then, when ubuntu rewrites menu.lst, the kernel paramters will include video= automatically! :)
[08:16] <arrenlex> clayg: And I meant to tell you before you left: In any case, benchmarks will typically only measure one aspect of your computer. When you use your machine, you use a variety of things. A fast processor with a tiny amount of ram will be horribly slow, for example. Your computer's perceived "speed" depends on clock speed, bus width, ram, hard disk RPM, network latency... all sorts of things.
[08:16] <clayg> http://pastebin.ca/282043
[08:16] <clayg> damn still only 2hgz
[08:16] <revolutionstudio> any suggestions?
[08:16] <clayg> how can i actually see it going 4 ghz
[08:16] <clayg> or at least 3, jeez
[08:16] <arrenlex> clayg: What do you mean, 4GHz? It's only a 2GHz processor.
[08:16] <clayg> in ech core right?
[08:16] <clayg> wait, i think i see
[08:16] <arrenlex> clayg: it doesn't work like that XD
[08:16] <damageDOn1> Thanks for nothing
[08:17] <jughead> revolutionstudio, for windows or kubuntu?  kopete does them all I think
[08:17] <arrenlex> clayg: You don't just multiply by the number of cores. It's not linear.
[08:17] <clayg> ouch
[08:17] <clayg> seems useless
[08:17] <proqesi> clayg: all OSes will show it as 2.. I have a core2duo myself and run OS X and XP
[08:17] <Ciobin> I've a PC with 2 hd: on 1 hd with Windows and another with Ubuntu. After installed Ubuntu, it ask me of reboot my pc. I've reboot it and I've change the sequence of boot on bios menu with hd Ubuntu in the first position. After I've boot the pc and this is what I see: 1- Logo mb, 2- Cursor Pulse on my monitor and dosn't load more nothing. Sorry for my english
[08:17] <arrenlex> clayg: You now have both cores recognised. Your computer will be as fast as it was intended to be. Core 2 duo, I am told, is pretty darn fast.
[08:17] <revolutionstudio> for windows really for this computer...the other one runs kubuntu and has everything in it already
[08:17] <clayg> 2ghz?
[08:17] <clayg> i mean it seems fast
[08:17] <arrenlex> clayg: As I said, ghz do not translate into speed.
[08:17] <proqesi> clayg: yes
[08:17] <clayg> i need a power hungry app
[08:17] <clayg> any suggestions?
[08:17] <scribus> proqesi: u running parallels?
[08:18] <clayg> i have 1 gig of ram and it's the 2ghz core 2 duo model
[08:18] <arrenlex> clayg: blender
[08:18] <Ciobin> How can I do to start my Ubuntu?
[08:18] <proqesi> scribus: no, I run ubuntu natively
[08:18] <jughead> Ciobin, did you install grub to the MBR?
[08:18] <revolutionstudio> ciobin did you not get a grub/
[08:18] <revolutionstudio> ?
[08:18] <clayg> also i installed a hp all in one, whatrs a good app to utilize the scanning, copying and other features?
[08:18] <scribus> proqesi: never tried it for ubuntu install under osx?
[08:18] <jughead> revolutionstudio, for windows I use Trillian Basic (it's free)
[08:18] <clayg> lemme install blender and check it out
[08:19] <proqesi> scribus: not with parallels
[08:19] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> how do i know whether hardware 3d acceleration is supported under Ubunut?
[08:19] <scribus> proqesi: ic
[08:19] <ajax4> epagoge: I wanted to verify that I was putting it in the right place...because it didn't work. The line you gave me was "video=800x600-16@60" right?
[08:19] <Ciobin> jughead: Yes I think
[08:19] <scribus> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: run glxgears
[08:19] <arrenlex> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: What's the output of "glxinfo | grep ender"?
[08:19] <arrenlex> scribus: That is not helpful.
[08:19] <scribus> ;)
[08:19] <scribus> woops
[08:19] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> arrenlex .ok
[08:19] <jughead> Ciobin, if you installed grub to the MBR then set BIOS to boot from the windows hard drive
[08:19] <clayg> hehe actualyl openoffice is kinda hungry also
[08:20] <clayg> lemme try that, so far everything is opening fast
[08:20] <clayg> but that is only xchat and terminal
[08:20] <clayg> those aren't that big
[08:20] <arrenlex> clayg: Somehow I think word processor < 3D animator =P
[08:20] <Ciobin> jughead: but in the hd where I've installed Ubuntu I suppose
[08:20] <clayg> open office usually had a second or so
[08:20] <clayg> arrenlex, agreed
[08:20] <clayg> but still
[08:20] <clayg> is blender animation?
[08:20] <arrenlex> clayg: Yes.
[08:20] <arrenlex> !blender
[08:20] <ubotu> blender is a free application for 3D modelling, animation, rendering, etc. You can install it from Ubuntu's repositories, and tutorials are at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro
[08:20] <clayg> im downloading it now
[08:20] <clayg> just d/ling slow
[08:20] <Ciobin> jughead: Already done. The only thing that I see is the cursor pulse
[08:21] <clayg> Linux youngman 2.6.15-27-686 #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Dec 8 18:00:07 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[08:21] <arrenlex> clayg: And? I told you, your computer is as fast as it was intended to be.
[08:21] <revolutionstudio> with trillian will i be able to connect to freenode with this name/
[08:21] <Ciobin> jughead: I've try to set before one and after other in the boot sequence
[08:21] <jughead> Ciobin, does the grub menu appear before the cursor pulse?
[08:22] <clayg> arrenlex, ok man got blender this looks like a program you use to create animations, i was looking for something that had something already made and would display or run to show me the speed
[08:22] <clayg> is there something in this im missing?
[08:22] <Ciobin> jughead: no nothing appear. Only the cursor pulse
[08:22] <arrenlex> clayg: Oh. xD
[08:22] <arrenlex> clayg: No. You asked for a heavy app.
[08:22] <scribus> anyone experience with boot errors like this:
[08:22] <scribus> "Unknown Interrupt or fault at EIP 00000060"
[08:22] <scribus> (..)
[08:22] <clayg> oh is there a lag when you run it?
[08:22] <arrenlex> clayg: No.
[08:22] <clayg> if so then im very happy
[08:22] <proqesi> clayg: create a mesh and click on the render option
[08:23] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> arrenlex , it reads
[08:23] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[08:23] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> direct rendering: Yes
[08:23] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) 845G 20050225
[08:23] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> is that good
[08:23] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ?
[08:23] <arrenlex> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: Yes. You have 3D acceleration.
[08:23] <clayg> i dont use graphic/video design programs

[08:23] <jughead> Ciobin, you might need to fix grub, which I do not know about
[08:23] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> arrenlex ,yay !! thanks ... :) i just wanted to check whether that driver i installed worked or not ....
[08:23] <jughead> I think you can do it through the liveCD but I'm not sure
[08:24] <seanj> hi people
[08:24] <arrenlex> !hi
[08:24] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:24] <clayg> i hit render and it had a box with a grey 3 dimensional box in it
[08:24] <arrenlex> clayg: Congratulations, your first 3D rendering :)
[08:24] <scribus> clayg: press space -> add->mesh->monkey
[08:24] <Ciobin> jughead: Ok. I'll try to fix it. Tnks in advance
[08:24] <Zac1> @hamster
[08:24] <jughead> good luck Ciobin
[08:24] <Ciobin> :)
[08:24] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> that sounds like Blender :) thats a nice package :)
[08:25] <Ciobin> god save the queen
[08:26] <MistaED> hehe *is learning blender at this very moment as well*
[08:26] <clayg> ok well it works
[08:26] <clayg> i dont know what to compair it to, but it works
[08:26] <arrenlex> Blender's interface was designed by blind, retarded monkeys. But the package is amazing.
[08:26] <_james> How to auto mount on my windows whenever i reboot?
[08:26] <arrenlex> (as, by the way, was Gimp's. Name, too.)
[08:26] <clayg> wish i knew if it was working fast or not
[08:26] <spikeb> heh
[08:27] <spikeb> there is no good 3d modelling application interface
[08:27] <clayg> i need someting with numbers or some sort of base comparison, how long does it take to render the picture normally?
[08:27] <clayg> on avg i guess
[08:27] <un_operateur1> what could this mean when trying to apt-get install opera from opera's repo --- opera: Depends: libqt3c102-mt (>= 3:3.2.1) which is a virtual package.
[08:27] <un_operateur1> ?
[08:27] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> clayg ,depedns on what rendering options u've set and ur graphics card ;)
[08:27] <arrenlex> spikeb: Maybe not, but there is "pretty good",  "useable", and "DAMN RETARDED MONKEYS!"
[08:27] <MistaED> coming from a maya perspective to blender, there are some really cool UI design choices in blender, it really reminds me of after effects 7
[08:28] <spikeb> arrenlex: no, only the last when it comes to every 3d model app i've used heh
[08:28] <un_operateur1> !libqt3c102-mt
[08:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about libqt3c102-mt - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:28] <MistaED> one issue is that i have no idea how to spawn off windows to the second monitor, any ideas?
[08:28] <arrenlex> spikeb: I've been told that Maya has a pretty good interface. Ever used that?
[08:28] <soresore> is there a front end for wlan tools?
[08:28] <soresore> coz i hates it :<
[08:28] <spikeb> arrenlex: yes. monkeys.
[08:28] <_james> How to auto mount on my windows drive whenever i reboot my ubuntu?
[08:28] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> clayg ,u got Bllendder from the repository? then what version of blender is it? i want to get it too...i have it on win none on lin ...

[08:29] <Shadowpillar> well linux has no idea what webcam I have
[08:29] <arrenlex> Oh. I guess not. Sorry.
[08:29] <Shadowpillar> or what chipset it is
[08:29] <Shadowpillar> anyone?
[08:29] <spikeb> blender is in the repos, yes
[08:29] <MistaED> arrenlex: maya sadly uses motif so it's clunky, but the interface is quite good as i'm used to it :P but sometimes there's just too many overlapping windows and you need two monitors at times
[08:29] <spikeb> i should install it
[08:29] <arrenlex> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: In edgy repos? 2.42a-1ubuntu1
[08:30] <Shadowpillar> only comes up as a usb audio device
[08:30] <gephal1> Hi,all. Does anyone know of an application that could extract text from the abominable microsoft .lit format?
[08:30] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> arrenlex ,oh k ... then i'll use the repo :) ... i needed the latest one... and i hardly ever use synaptic ...
[08:30] <scribus> clayg: u could benchmakr your system also with "john-the-ripper" ;) e.g.: john --test
[08:30] <gephal1> I've got some books I downloaded that I'd really like to read- but can't do that on my linux box at home.
[08:30] <wildchild> hello guys.. Is there any recovery mode, in case that my edgy can't get into x ?
[08:30] <arrenlex> gephal1: "strings" can extract text from anything... no formatting, of course.
[08:30] <arrenlex> (command line, gepha1)
[08:30] <gephal1> wildchild: Yeah- the terminal-
[08:31] <seanj> for my webcam i had to wait a few releases, then it was magically recognized
[08:31] <spikeb> heh
[08:31] <spikeb> seanj: been there
[08:31] <scribus> wildchild: use lynx!
[08:31] <scribus> :p

[08:32] <tripppy> ive been told to modprobe a twinhan DVB-t card. but i dont know how.
[08:32] <[Relic] > what are my options for java?
[08:32] <gephal1> wildchild: umm...i couldnt make much sense of that- but i suppose what you're trying to say is that your X went bonkers, right? just  : $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:32] <HyperHacker> so I've noticed something interesting
[08:32] <arrenlex> !java | [Relic] 
[08:32] <ubotu> [Relic] : To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:33] <MistaED> trippy: i have the exact card, try in a terminal: sudo modprobe dvb-bt8xx
[08:33] <HyperHacker> to get a serial mouse working in Ubuntu requires editing config files and rebooting, which is impossible on a liveCD
[08:33] <gephal1> it'll restore your configuration automatically- assuming that you've not made drastic changes in your hardware
[08:33] <HyperHacker> so you can't use a serial mouse with the liveCD
[08:33] <un_operateur1> !libqt3
[08:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about libqt3 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:33] <wildchild> gephal1: no after reboot. There wasn't any window to fill in my password... It just stoped..
[08:33] <seanj> no serial mouse? that's a bummer
[08:33] <MistaED> and programs like kaffeine will detect it and scan for channels, that's the best program for tv/dvb cards if you don't want a headache
[08:33] <arrenlex> !libqt3-mt | un_operateur1
[08:33] <ubotu> libqt3-mt: Qt GUI Library (Threaded runtime version), Version 3. In component main, is optional. Version 3:3.3.6-3ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 3064 kB, installed size 8712 kB
[08:33] <HyperHacker> installing, for some silly reason, requires a mouse because the keyboard can't be used to navigate the interface
[08:33] <arrenlex> :)
[08:34] <Madpilot> HyperHacker, how old a computer do you have to have to actually still run a serial mouse?
[08:34] <HyperHacker> so Ubuntu is comlpetely unuseable to those with serial mice, or no mice at all.
[08:34] <gephal1> anything interesting in the screen dump during boot? like kernel panic?
[08:34] <HyperHacker> it's not that old really
[08:34] <dabaR> HyperHacker: use the alternate install cd
[08:34] <Madpilot> HyperHacker, the alternative install has a text-only mode
[08:34] <HyperHacker> I thought Linux was supposed to be good with older hardware anyway?
[08:35] <gephal1> I'd not know how to resolve that kinda thing either-  just try to see what the error is- during boot, if you're seeing the `ubuntu loading` window, try to switch to a tty1 (Ctrl+alt+1) and see if there are any messages you think is causing the problem
[08:35] <seanj> by default it's good with lots of old hardware...i guess just not with a distro aimed at newer machines
[08:35] <HyperHacker> I might try that text-only mode tomorrow when I'm not supposed to be asleep
[08:35] <gephal1> google for it- or come back here if you aren't able to find any help on places like ubuntuforums.org
[08:35] <dabaR> HyperHacker: that is the preferred CD by me.
[08:36] <wildchild> gephal1: all nice and right, if I could come again to x :) last time I had to reinstall :S
[08:36] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> btw...totem doesnt support mp3 s by default?
[08:36] <un_operateur1> nothing supports mp3s by default
[08:36] <seanj> if i ever have X problems i edit xorg.conf and change video driver to vesa
[08:36] <HyperHacker> the real problem here is people who can't use a mouse for whatever reason can't use the graphical install, and I'd imagine the rest of the interface has the same problem once it's installed
[08:36] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> hmm.... time to find the plugin ...

[08:37] <wildchild> gephal1:that's why I am asking for some kind of safe mode or nongraphic mode If there is a way to choose (like in windows f4)
[08:37] <gephal1> wildchild: we've all been there- and I can tell you- having used Fedora Core (my first linux distro) i am not that eager for nostalgia- had to reinstall the damnd thing every 2 weeks.
[08:37] <wildchild> :S
[08:37] <wildchild> that sux
[08:37] <gephal1> wildchild: during OS boot, press scape.
[08:37] <wildchild> yes
[08:37] <gephal1> it'll take you to the GRUB menu- from there, choose safe mode

[08:39] <herfer> ugh.
[08:39] <gaurav19> Hi un_operateur1, still no success

[08:40] <herfer> nope.
[08:40] <arrenlex> herfer: Or else unavailable options.
[08:40] <herfer> I even switched to the vga driver
[08:40] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, did you manage to get grub working?
[08:40] <herfer> just to go overkill and just get into X

[08:43] <un_operateur1> lol
[08:43] <herfer> firing up ubuntu just to play was going to be my "afternoon project"
[08:43] <vanberge> is there a 'supported' way to make a bit level copy of a hard disk?  for example i want to buy a new hard drive but don't want to re-install everything!
[08:43] <arrenlex> herfer: What card?
[08:43] <herfer> now 8 hours later I still have only CLI on it.
[08:43] <herfer> matrox p750
[08:43] <arrenlex> vanberge: man dd
[08:43] <herfer> for triple-head.
[08:43] <seanj> coudln't a person use dd for that
[08:43] <seanj> yeah. lol
[08:44] <herfer> id' be happy to just get one monitor working at this point.
[08:44] <spikeb> heh
[08:44] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> !date u
[08:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about date u - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:44] <vanberge> arrenlex, i thought of that... but didn't know how recommended that woudl be
[08:44] <gaurav19> thanks GreyGhost. My situation is that I have windows XP installed already and two partitions 19Gb and 1 GB for ubuntu 6.06 - did you also install ubuntu over Windows Xp to get a dual boot. most tutorials i have seen require installation of ubuntu followed by windows
[08:44] <arrenlex> vanberge: Probably not recommended.
[08:44] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> hmm.... dumb thing ... gonna remian unmarried for the rest of its life...
[08:44] <gephalt> herfer: i've seen good documentation on that  kinda card
[08:44] <herfer> great.
[08:45] <gephalt> herfer: I am not sure- but can you check gentoo forums/docs-howtos?
[08:45] <seanj> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, that's okay... if they get married, they'll make more :P
[08:45] <herfer> i'm using driver=vga.  that's it.  dead end.
[08:45] <vanberge> arrenlex, yeah, i was afraid of that...  :-(
[08:45] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> gaurav19 , no ..i installed Ubuntu after XP....
[08:45] <herfer> there's no deeper troubleshooting basement to go to than driver=vga.
[08:45] <seanj> the video problem is unfortunately where windoze shines.. it can almost always tell you what chipset you have
[08:45] <nicholaspaul> Here's another Q: Can i install from the PPC live Edgy disc?
[08:45] <gephalt> herfer: i am saying this cause you may need to compile your own kernel.
[08:45] <herfer> so no ubuntu. The end.
[08:45] <Madpilot> nicholaspaul, yes
[08:45] <spikeb> why would you switch from freebsd anyway
[08:45] <arrenlex> herfer: I've had that happen when I tried using vga with a high bit depth...
[08:46] <herfer> spikeb: _exactly_
[08:46] <seanj> bab there's never a the-end with Gnu/Linux
[08:46] <tkroo> i'm getting "Unable to mount the selected volume" Error: given UDI is not a mountable volume on my floppy drive. how can i fix this?
[08:46] <revolutionstudio> ok who referred me to trillian
[08:46] <herfer> spikeb: unfortunately, there is no vmware support on freebsd.
[08:46] <emun> hi just wondering, is there an antivirus software for ubuntu
[08:46] <herfer> no modern vmware support, that is.
[08:46] <spikeb> herfer: ahhhhh
[08:46] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> gaurav19 ,but that meant that i had to overwrite mbr with GRUB so that XP was booted using grub and not ntldr
[08:46] <arrenlex> !clamav | emun
[08:46] <ubotu> clamav: antivirus scanner for Unix. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.88.4-1ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 65 kB, installed size 208 kB
[08:46] <nicholaspaul> Madpilot: sweet. should i run the thing as 'live' first, or should i install from the beginning?
[08:46] <arrenlex> !virus | emun
[08:46] <ubotu> emun: A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[08:46] <tkroo> i am able to write to the floppy via /dev/fd0 however.
[08:46] <seanj> qemu might do the same thing vmware does, for free
[08:46] <Madpilot> nicholaspaul, with the Ubuntu LiveCDs, you run them, then install from inside the live session - there's an Install icon on the desktop
[08:46] <arrenlex> seanj: Some parts of vmware has recently been made free.
[08:46] <arrenlex> (Free as in beer)
[08:47] <gaurav19> GreyGhost, thats what I didn't try - I guess this kind of paranoia is justified for windows users :)
[08:47] <spikeb> herfer: one of my friends is a FreeBSD zealot :)
[08:47] <nicholaspaul> Madpilot: oh. That didnt work.. wonder why? It just 'spun' and then stopped...
[08:47] <emun> thanks guys
[08:47] <seanj> arrenlex, that's kind of helpful... i'd still recommend qemu over it though since it's 100% free as in freedom
[08:47] <herfer> believe me - I'd love to keep running fbsd as my desktop
[08:47] <seanj> i got qemu to work running windows 98
[08:47] <revolutionstudio> some one please tell me how to set up the connection to freenode in trillian
[08:47] <spikeb> herfer: but you absolutely require vmware eh
[08:47] <seanj> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=39513 <- qemu how-to for breezy, etc
[08:48] <arrenlex> seanj: And also slower as in molasses.
[08:48] <gephalt> whats so good about freebsd anyway?
[08:48] <seanj> lol yes it is
[08:48] <faust_> Does anyone know what's up with the backspace key in 6.10?
[08:48] <dabaR> nicholaspaul: did you hold down the boot from cd key?
[08:48] <seanj> but reasonable for simple experimentation
[08:48] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> gaurav19 , i to am an XP user ... btw how do u plan to partition that 1GB for Ubuntu ....?? cos u'll need atleast 2 partitions...
[08:48] <faust_> Got it fixed to "back" again in firefox, but other apps still just want to do pageup.
[08:48] <nicholaspaul> dabaR: yea, i can boot into 'Live' but the install icon doesnt work. It just ... thinks about it... then does nothing.
[08:48] <dabaR> oh
[08:48] <nicholaspaul> dabaR: is there a command line option so i can see what happened?
[08:49] <seanj> doesn't Ubuntu require more than 1Gb for installation ?
[08:49] <un_operateur1> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, he already has ubuntu installed (i think)
[08:49] <wildchild> I can't finde pkg_config_path http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37510/ can someone tell me how to edit this "path"
[08:49] <dabaR> dependability...?
[08:49] <seanj> dabaR, yes. lol
[08:49] <arrenlex> wildchild: apt-get install jack
[08:49] <tkroo> ok, solved, found this: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-76517.html
[08:50] <nicholaspaul> ubiquity- is that 'Ubuntu Equity'?
[08:50] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> gaurav19 , previouly .... i had FC 5 .... for which a installed GRUB on a separtte partition (cos i was not very determined to allow another ap to overwrite my mbr...) but the 6.06 livecd of Ubuntu left me with no choice...
[08:50] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> un_operateur1 ,oh k .. that i didn know....
[08:50] <seanj> nicholaspaul, i love that!
[08:50] <dabaR> wildchild: why not post the whole output?
[08:50] <nicholaspaul> :D
[08:50] <dabaR> wildchild: and also the sources.list file, please.
[08:50] <wildchild> k
[08:50] <nicholaspaul> nite all.
[08:50] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> omg !!! why does blendeer run in out of the screen mode???
[08:50] <seanj> good night :)
[08:50] <dabaR> nicholaspaul: no, it means everywhereness
[08:51] <spikeb> lol
[08:51] <seanj> keep 'em comin' :)
[08:51] <spikeb> dabaR: you're off to a fine start
[08:51] <Em0ry42> Would anyone be able to help me get Wireless setup on my Dell Inspiron 9100?
[08:51] <tkroo> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, launch it with a -w (i think)
[08:51] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> it wont even allow me to resize it....
[08:51] <arrenlex> dabaR: Pretty soon you'll be making up new meanings for words that already exist...
[08:51] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> oh k
[08:52] <arrenlex> dabaR: And then who knows? You could be president!
[08:52] <emun> is there software similar to partition magic for ubuntu ie partition without losing your data like with fdisk
[08:52] <wildchild> dabaR: config: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37511/ sources: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37512/
[08:52] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> tkroo ,thanks thats better ... how do i default this now?
[08:52] <arrenlex> !gparted | emun
[08:52] <ubotu> emun: gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[08:52] <deconvolution> hi, My madwifi card cannot connect to the router, iwconfig show it has lots Rx invalid nwid, what does this mean?
[08:52] <dabaR> emun: it is called parted, and has a gparted or qtparted frontend
[08:53] <tkroo> gparted livecd is very nice
[08:53] <emun> great help thanks
[08:53] <arrenlex> wildchild: apt-get install jack
[08:53] <dabaR> wildchild: new version good?
[08:53] <wildchild> mm, nothig about unstable..
[08:53] <wildchild> just new version..
[08:53] <Okt> Hey guys, back with some more questions. I had Ubuntu working fine, I went to edit my xorg.conf to add support for my mouse, and it crashed. So I replaced it with the backup and now when I log in Gnome shows for a second and then dissapears.
[08:53] <Em0ry42> Broadcom 4306, just ignores me when I try to connect to WiFi, iwconfig says "Access Point: Invalid" what does this mean?
[08:53] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> clayg ,what time did the render take?
[08:54] <wildchild> arrenlex: read my paste about config..
[08:54] <dabaR> wildchild: what about that jack package arrenlex suggested?
[08:54] <wildchild> I allready have installed jack..
[08:54] <lemao> how to I find all files that do not start with . (dot). Basically all files that are not hidden?
[08:55] <dabaR> wildchild: libjack0.100.0-dev?
[08:55] <vanberge> Okt, you could re-run X config?  i dont knwo the exact command off the top of my head
[08:55] <arrenlex> lemao: find by default does not search hidden files. Thus find / "*" should do it.
[08:55] <gaurav19> GreyGhost, un_operateur: Here's the structure: disk 1: C(primary 20 GB) D (19 GB - logical ) E(1Gb - Logical) F(120 Gb -extended) I booted the system with the cd and then in ubuntu env, selected D (19 GB) for "/" and E(1 GB) for swap -- all went fine, no message and then the installation dialog vanished without a message - successful or error !!
[08:55] <arrenlex> find / -name "*"
[08:55] <arrenlex> ...oh. No, it does.
[08:55] <arrenlex> Ignore me
[08:55] <seanj> once upon a time it didn't. hehe
[08:56] <lemao> arrenlex: that would have been great...
[08:56] <seanj> brb
[08:56] <faust_> Does anyone know how to change backspace behaviour in gThumb? In browse mode it used to go one folder up, but now it just tries a pageup.
[08:56] <lemao> arrenlex: I tried something like 'find . -regex "[^.] .*" but it doesnt work
[08:56] <gaurav19> GreyGhost, un_operateur: as un_operateur told me before that Ubuntu is installed, I tried to modify the boot.ini as I didnt want to install grub at all, but now it seems that Grub is a mustfor 6.06 at least
[08:57] <dabaR> faust_: alt up should do one dir up
[08:57] <wildchild> dabaR: now jack isn't the problem but: glib >= 1.2.0) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH :
[08:57] <wildchild> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37513/
[08:57] <malt1> what is a simple mail server or something that wil just send out emails for like php nuke and phpbb for email confirm?
[08:57] <dabaR> wildchild: and you have build-essential?
[08:58] <faust_> dabaR: Yeah, but that still gives me an usability issue, since it's pretty far from alt to up on non-us keyboards.
[08:58] <wildchild> dabaR: yes, but  libqt3-dev isn't on my package list
[08:58] <gaurav19> GreyGhost, un_operateur1: How about 6.10 - does that require GRUB too?
[08:58] <wildchild> I did it by http://sp0rky-n00b.co.uk/djplay/1.html
[08:58] <arrenlex> lemao: Does this work? find -name "**[^.] "
[08:59] <dabaR> wildchild: I think that libc6 is what you want in order to fix the last error you gave
[08:59] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, they all need some bootloader -- grub is ubuntu's bootloader of choice
[08:59] <arrenlex> lemao: That also searches hidden folders, though. This is bad?
[08:59] <tkroo> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, maybe just make an alias to launch blender with -w ? if you want that default
[08:59] <lemao> yes
[08:59] <lemao> arrenlex: yes
[08:59] <jacquesmerde> if i install then uninstall a package with synaptic, it'll leave all its unneeded dependences installed yeah?
[08:59] <wildchild> dabaR: I allready have that one
[09:00] <lemao> arrenlex: I basically need to copy a tree of files from point A to point B without the subversion .svn folders
[09:00] <seanj> i'm sure there's a way to exclude dot-files with a regular expression with find.. i just forget which format
[09:00] <dabaR> wildchild: to teach you how to find which one is needed..... aptitude search <whateverIsMissing>|grep dev, so aptitude search glib| grep dev
[09:00] <lemao> arrenlex: So I can package the tree as a DEBIAN package.
[09:00] <lemao> arrenlex: but I cant figure out how...
[09:01] <dabaR> lemao: I like #bash for that kind of question.
[09:01] <arrenlex> lemao: find -name "**[^.] "  | grep -v "/\."
[09:01] <arrenlex> xD
[09:01] <seanj> awesome!
[09:01] <seanj> lol
[09:01] <tripppy> MistaED, do you use myth TV?
[09:01] <gaurav19> un_operateur1, yes thats fine, I though ubuntu might have done something to live with the windows bootloader - what are the chances of things going wrong with Windows XP in case I install grub ? I will have to use the windows XP installation disk to recover the installation
[09:02] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, let me find you a quick and easy bootloader to install within windows
[09:02] <arrenlex> lemao: Does that work? xD
[09:02] <lemao> arrenlex: great. thanks
[09:02] <arrenlex> lemao: Hehe.
[09:02] <Okt> I am now sitting at a "busy" cursor, how can I see what is going on?
[09:03] <scribus> ctrl+alt+f1 for teh win!
[09:03] <lemao> arrenlex: getting warmer... :-)
[09:03] <gaurav19> un_operateur1, I would be really grateful for that
[09:03] <wildchild> dabaR: when I do aptitude search glib| grep dev, there are more than one suggestions: on what I have to be focused...http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37515/
[09:03] <arrenlex> lemao: More problems? xD
[09:04] <arrenlex> wildchild: libglib-dev should be what you want.
[09:04] <dabaR> wildchild: well, read the error, 1.2 or greater. request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
[09:04] <lemao> arrenlex: I guess I can use the output of that command piped to the cpio, right?
[09:04] <dabaR> domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name,
[09:04] <dabaR> netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope;
[09:04] <MistaED> trippy: i'd like to, i'm not sure how to use it personally
[09:04] <dabaR> weird.
[09:04] <un_operateur1> gaurav19, here you go -- http://www.ranish.com/part/xosl.htm
[09:04] <arrenlex> lemao: what do you want to do to it?
[09:05] <lemao> arrenlex: I basically want to copy a tree of files from point A to point B excluding .svn folders
[09:06] <un_operateur1> do they have to be copied in order?
[09:06] <dabaR> wildchild: so libglib1.2-dev, or libglib2.0-dev I would try the first one.
[09:06] <arrenlex> lemao: How about something like that command | xargs -I "foo" cp -r foo folder2/
[09:07] <arrenlex> lemao: Warning: came off the top of my head. No guarantee that it won't screw everything up. o_o
[09:07] <un_operateur1> or   for i in `find /path/to/folder | egrep -vi "\.svn$"`; do cp $i b/; done
[09:07] <tripppy> MistaED, what do you use to watch/record Tv?
[09:07] <jerb_> magnetic tape?
[09:07] <scribus> lemao: what about tar ...blah --exlcude=PATTERN
[09:07] <arrenlex> lemao: I tried it on a very simple example. Seems to work.
[09:08] <wildchild> is this maybe couse I couldn't install libqt3-dev. Now I tryed again apt-get install and here are packages need to be installed: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37516/
[09:08] <MistaED> trippy: just kaffeine, it's a kde app but there's no gnome equal for recording/detecting tv channels painlessly
[09:08] <scribus> erm, exclude
[09:08] <dabaR> wildchild: install libqt3-mt-dev and libglib1.2-dev
[09:09] <dabaR> wildchild: then try to configure again
[09:09] <arrenlex> wildchild: apt-get install kdebase-dev is the better way to do that, because it gives you all the packages you need to compile a qt app.
[09:09] <wildchild> dabaR: I have those 2 :S
[09:09] <lemao> arrenlex: you mean create tar excluding .svn, untar it at B and remove tar?
[09:09] <arrenlex> lemao: I don't mean anything. That was scribus.
[09:09] <un_operateur1> I'd install   libqt3-mt and  libqt3-mt-dev
[09:09] <arrenlex> lemao: _I_ suggested using xargs
[09:10] <dabaR> wildchild: show me the configure output again, and output of aptitude search libqt3-mt-dev libglib1.2-dev
[09:10] <podr0znik> another question - I wanted to delete the Gaim packes 'cause I don't like Gaim (I use Kopete). But then it says that wants to remove ubuntu-desktop also.
[09:10] <podr0znik> What does that mean?
[09:10] <podr0znik> I hope not that I will be convicted to command line?
[09:10] <podr0znik> :)
[09:10] <dabaR> !ubuntu-desktop > podr0znik
[09:10] <arrenlex> podr0znik: ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that can be safely removed.
[09:10] <arrenlex> !metapackage | podr0znik
[09:10] <ubotu> podr0znik: A meta-package is a package that simply depends upon other packages and brings them in. It's not a real package, but a very useful package that can drag in other package versions.
[09:11] <podr0znik> ah I see, ok, thanks again :)
[09:12] <wildchild> dabaR configure output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37519/ ; aptitude output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37520/
[09:12] <arrenlex> wildchild: Those pastes are the same.
[09:13] <dabaR> and neither show output of the commands I asked for.
[09:13] <wildchild> oh sorry
[09:14] <paranoid_android> hi there. im trying to execute a linux binary from a terminal. however, no matter what i do, i keep getting told No such file or directory. what can i do?? thank you :)
[09:14] <arrenlex> paranoid_android: chmod +x <file> && ./<file>
[09:14] <dabaR> paranoid_android: did you put ./ in front of binary file name when running it?
[09:14] <wildchild> dabaR: aptitude: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37521/
[09:14] <paranoid_android> yep, its already executable and i did the ./ bit
[09:14] <arrenlex> ...that is still the same thing. xD
[09:15] <zazza> would anyone help me with an ESS 18xxx ISA Soundcard not detected?
[09:15] <arrenlex> paranoid_android: Use tab completion to make sure you get the name right.
[09:15] <dabaR> wildchild: aptitude search libqt3-mt-dev libglib1.2-dev
[09:15] <lemao> arrenlex: This worked great:    find | grep -v '/[.] ' | cpio -p ~/test
[09:15] <paranoid_android> arrenlex: i do. the name is only 8 characters long as well, and its clearly visible what it is too. =\
[09:15] <un_operateur1> aptitude install libqt3-mt libqt3-mt-dev
[09:16] <arrenlex> lemao: What does cpio do? I've never seen that command before.
[09:16] <arrenlex> paranoid_android: What's the name of the file?
[09:16] <tsmithe> hello everyone
[09:16] <un_operateur1> !cpio

[09:17] <tsmithe> does anyone here know how to set up mailman with postfix?

[09:17] <tripppy> MistaED, i just did a a probe that u suggested to me. i have the PCI one. 3020C.
[09:17] <x-r00t-x> un_operateur1,  can you tell me a good vnc server name for xp?
[09:17] <zazza> sorry guys... got an ISA soundcard not detected ESS 18xxx...
[09:17] <tripppy> MistaED, it didnt get found.
[09:17] <lemao> arrenlex: this is the first time I used it. it seems to be a very powerful recursive copy command that has one mode to copy file names passed into the standard input
[09:17] <un_operateur1> x-r00t-x, tightvnc
[09:18] <tsmithe> anyone?

[09:18] <x-r00t-x> :D
[09:18] <wildchild> dabaR: and configure output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37525/
[09:19] <dabaR> tsmithe: google has to know about a tutorial on that.
[09:19] <tsmithe> yeah
[09:19] <tsmithe> i went through it
[09:19] <dabaR> wildchild: and what do you think you need to install next?
[09:19] <un_operateur1> dabaR, what are you building?
[09:19] <tsmithe> but i'm getting one persistent error that isn't very helpful
[09:19] <wildchild> dabaR those 2 packages ? :)
[09:19] <dabaR> un_operateur1: read the configure output
[09:20] <x-r00t-x> un_operateur1,  may i need VNC Enterprise Edition for Unix ??
[09:20] <x-r00t-x> on my ubuntu
[09:20] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> tkroo ,ok
[09:20] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> i was afk ....
[09:20] <un_operateur1> x-r00t-x, I thought you wanted to vnc to a windows box? :)
[09:20] <wildchild> dabaR: how can I isntall bouth packages in the same command: sudo apt-get install libglib1.2-dev & libqt3-mt-dev  ?
[09:20] <dabaR> wildchild: no, it says... configure: error: Library requirements (libusb >= 0.1.11) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them. That means you use my formula, aptitude search <whateverConfigureSaysIsMissing>|grep dev. so, aptitude search libusb|grep dev
[09:21] <arrenlex> paranoid_android: ....that is so weird. o_o
[09:21] <dabaR> wildchild: just a space between them
[09:21] <x-r00t-x> un_operateur1,  yes . ubuntu to windows
[09:21] <paranoid_android> arrenlex: told ya lol
[09:21] <x-r00t-x> un_operateur1, i got it ... tnx for your help
[09:21] <un_operateur1> dabar is djplay is indeed what you are building -- i think this satisfies your build dependancies -- apt-get build-dep djplay
[09:21] <un_operateur1> if*
[09:21] <tsmithe> bah
[09:21] <tsmithe> i'm outta here
[09:22] <MistaED> trippy: ok you opened up kaffeine and it didn't do anything?
[09:22] <dabaR> un_operateur1: haha, good point
[09:22] <amonkey> why is apache2 ignoring my .htaccess file?
[09:22] <arrenlex> dabaR: Any ideas? xD http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37524/
[09:22] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> gaurav19 , if Ranish works for u then its fine ... but i knew of a project called Win GRUB that allowed u to load grub using ntldr (ntldr still sat over the mbr) ....
[09:23] <unimatrix9> do you think there should be more tutorials for beginners about ubuntu?
=== Darst_ is now known as Darst
[09:24] <Flannel> unimatrix9: there's plenty of documentation out there
[09:24] <un_operateur1> !tutorials
[09:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tutorials - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:24] <arrenlex> unimatrix9: When was the last time you saw a tutorial for beginners about windows? People should learn by experimenting.
[09:24] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> !Ubuntuguide
[09:24] <unimatrix9> i see more books and tutorails then you can count in the local shops!
[09:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Ubuntuguide - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:24] <arrenlex> unimatrix9: Ever used one?
[09:25] <Flannel> unimatrix9: help.ubuntu.com
[09:25] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> unimatrix9 , try ubuntuguide.org
[09:25] <paranoid_android> arrenlex: go to the computing section of your local library, under 000 in the dewey decimal section. Windows (insert number, letters here) for Dummies :-)
[09:25] <unimatrix9> not me , but there must be thousends that use them, hence its in the shop for profit remember?
[09:25] <Wiseguy> hey guys, does anyone know how i would output my video on my svideo rather than the laptop monitor?
[09:25] <unimatrix9> use fn
[09:25] <amonkey> i'm having trouble with apache2 ignoring my .htaccess is /var/www, but in the apache2.conf file i can't find where /var/www is explicitly shared.
[09:26] <unimatrix9> and the srceen out button
[09:26] <Wiseguy> whats fn?
[09:26] <danniy> im a novice in linux and i have a problem, can someone pm me?
[09:26] <unimatrix9> its on your keyboard...
[09:26] <un_operateur1> egrep -i "\/var\/www" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf  maybe :)
[09:26] <arrenlex> !ask | danniy
[09:26] <ubotu> danniy: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:26] <Flannel> amonkey: ubuntu doesn't use apache2.conf for most stuff, it separates it out piecewise.  For instance, the /var/www you're looking for is in sites-enabled/
[09:26] <Wiseguy> ohhh
[09:27] <Wiseguy> but that outputs on the VGA
[09:27] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> danniy ,just ask it here.... more chances of u getting helped ...
[09:27] <Wiseguy> not the svideo
[09:27] <Wiseguy> or does it do both?
[09:27] <unimatrix9> oh yes you are right...sorry
[09:27] <miyako> I'm having a problem with installing Ubuntu on my G3 iBook.  I downloaded the 6.01 PPC DVD and burned the iso.  My Ubuntu box recognizes the disk, but when I put it in my iBook, I can see it in /Volumes but it won't boot, and I don't get the disk icon on the desktop (I don't see anything under /Volumes/Ubuntu 6.10, and when I ejected and re-inserted the disk it failed to show up under /Volumes)
[09:27] <podr0znik> ok, then me again with another stupid questions (if they exist)
[09:27] <unimatrix9> :P
[09:27] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> podr0znik , i rule at asking stupid questions
[09:27] <podr0znik> I'm trying to create an extra folder on my hard disk, just the way I was used to do that in W..... (don't want to curse here)
[09:27] <podr0znik> but the option is greyed out
[09:28] <SilentDis> 'lo :)
[09:28] <podr0znik> do you, GreyGhost? ;)
[09:28] <frogzoo> Wiseguy: are you running fglrx ?
[09:28] <arrenlex> !hi | SilentDis
[09:28] <ubotu> SilentDis: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:28] <Wiseguy> hey unimatrix9 did you ever go by the name nmatrix?
[09:28] <SilentDis> lol hi arrenlex, ubotu :)
[09:28] <danniy> ok, so i just installed ubuntu and i have i account, when i use the su command my password is not good, what to do?
[09:28] <Wiseguy> frogzoo, no... im on an integrated intel chip
[09:28] <malt1> is there any good free SMTP hosts? that i could use for temp for my phpbb site to use for email confirm
[09:28] <Wiseguy> i810 i believe
[09:28] <podr0znik> so then I thought I could log in as root, but that apparently doesn't work like logging in as another user
[09:28] <unimatrix9> no never
[09:28] <arrenlex> !sudo | danniy
[09:28] <ubotu> danniy: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:29] <danniy> thanx
[09:29] <unimatrix9> i got this nick registered so use it all the time
[09:29] <un_operateur1> su asks for root's password while sudo asks for yours
[09:29] <Wiseguy> ok, cause im sure i used to know a guy that used to idle in our linux chan that went by the name nmatrix9
[09:29] <danniy> but i did not made any root passwords
[09:29] <danniy> just my account
[09:29] <seanj> danniy: you only need your own password
[09:29] <unimatrix9> i am not that idle
[09:29] <arrenlex> danniy: sudo asks for YOUR password.
[09:29] <unimatrix9> :)
[09:29] <danniy> doesnt work
[09:29] <podr0znik> and regarding my question - would sudo also solve my thing?
[09:29] <un_operateur1> danniy, ubuntu doesnt have a root password set
[09:30] <SilentDis> podr0znik:  what are you looking to do?
[09:30] <un_operateur1>  .. by default atleast
[09:30] <podr0znik> very simple - create an extra folder on my hard disk
[09:30] <podr0znik> not in my home directory
[09:30] <danniy> i entered my pass, not good, i just entered blank , doesnt work
[09:30] <podr0znik> but from the root
[09:30] <Wiseguy> anyone else have any ideas on how i can switch to my svideo output?
[09:30] <un_operateur1> danniy,  i think you'll find that if you use sudo instead of su -- you'll be ok :)
[09:30] <SilentDis> podr0znik:  yes.  you can do a sudo mkdir /directory/name and it should allow you to (so long as the space is writeable)
[09:31] <un_operateur1> because sudo will ask for your password
[09:31] <zcat[1] > Wiseguy: what card?
[09:31] <miyako> podr0znik: try sudo mkdir /<directory names>
[09:31] <danniy> trying now
[09:31] <podr0znik> ok, let me try :)
[09:31] <unimatrix9> wiseguy
[09:31] <Rupie> The load average has three numbers. What do they mean?
[09:31] <unimatrix9> take a read for nvidia here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=318876

[09:32] <danniy> i just want to mount my win partitions
[09:32] <danniy> i dont know how to use sudo
[09:32] <zcat[1] > Wiseguy: sorry, can't help.. haven't had much experience with anything but nvidia :(
[09:32] <frogzoo> !ntfs | danniy
[09:32] <ubotu> danniy: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[09:32] <un_operateur1> Rupie, I think they correspond to the real, user and sys loads
[09:32] <danniy> i have only a su handbook
[09:33] <Rupie> un_operateur1: what's that mean? lol
[09:33] <SilentDis> danniy:  an easy way to think about it is this:  typing sudo before a command basically makes it like that command will execute as root
[09:33] <Wiseguy> zcat[1] , is it a nvidia util that is used for nvidia chipsets?
[09:33] <un_operateur1> danni -- just use sudo instead of su
[09:33] <un_operateur1> sudo <command>
[09:33] <danniy> ok trying
[09:33] <unimatrix9> Wiseguy for your card its different
[09:34] <zcat[1] > Wiseguy: I set up twinview by hand in the xorg.conf. If you had an nvidia I could probably help....
[09:34] <Wiseguy> hmm i see
[09:34] <SilentDis> danniy:  and if you need a gui program to run as root (as example, running nautilus as root), you can gksudo <command>
[09:35] <un_operateur1> Rupie - man uptime
[09:35] <podr0znik> (me very ashamed now, but you were also new someday, right guys?) damn, how to get to the command line option???
[09:35] <frogzoo> SilentDis: you never have to run a gui as root, and it's not really advisable
[09:35] <Wiseguy> another thing is a dont wanna have to statically set my xorg.conf everytime i wanna switch to svideo and then back to normal monitor... is that possible?
[09:35] <Kachingo> Howdy, how do you use apt-get to install from a cd?
[09:35] <Ktracho> hi i program in c++ in visual basic c++ in windows and i installes the KDE C/C++ for ubuntu i tried starting to do my program but i didnt work plis help me
[09:35] <Rupie> un_operateur1: ok, I'll try that, thanks.
[09:36] <frogzoo> Kachingo: open synaptic -> settings -> repos & add cd
[09:36] <zcat[1] > Wiseguy: dunno.. If I were asking, I'd probably start with a google search for xorg+intel+svideo and see what turns up..
[09:36] <Kachingo> frogzoo: how would I do it from the command line?
[09:36] <arrenlex> Ktracho: "visual basic c++" is like "java fortran". What do you mean?
[09:36] <unimatrix9> Wiseguy, i dont know, but i think you need to do some research on the topic
[09:36] <miyako> Ktracho, are you using C++ or Visual Basic?
[09:36] <un_operateur1> Kachingo, you pop the CD in -- sudo apt-cdrom; apt-get update; apt-get install <package>
[09:36] <Ktracho> C++
[09:36] <unimatrix9> here is an second read for the Wiseguy http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=141031
[09:36] <Kachingo> cheers
[09:36] <SilentDis> frogzoo:  very true, the only things that 'need' it really are stuff like the package manager, imo.  everything else should be done from a command line.  and, most of the apps that could use root access create their links with gksudo already, so it's just more 'info' to have more than anything else :)
[09:36] <un_operateur1> oops -- sudo sh -c "apt-cdrom; apt-get update; apt-get install <package>" :)
[09:37] <zcat[1] > http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=239894&highlight=xorg.conf  perhaps?
[09:37] <Okt> Is there a way I can access a USB drive from the terminal
[09:37] <unimatrix9> Wiseguy, dont forget to backup your xorg.conf file before editing it!
[09:37] <miyako> Ktracho, C++ applications written using the Windows API won't generally compile under Linux (I think there is a way to do it with Wine, but you'd probably have to ask some wine gurus)
[09:37] <Flannel> Okt: sure, just cd to whereever it's mounted
[09:38] <SilentDis> Okt:  did it automagically mount itself?  if it did, it'll be in /media/
[09:38] <unimatrix9> and have an live linux cd at hand, if thing go very wrong
[09:38] <zcat[1] > looks like you can set it up 'clone' so it will display the same on whatever happens to be plugged in...
[09:38] <Ktracho> ahh ok thanks
[09:38] <zcat[1] > that's how my tvout is set up ..
[09:38] <Okt> SilentDis: Not sure if it did, I am stuck without the gui
[09:38] <tripppy> MistaED,its finding stuff now.
[09:38] <miyako> if your application is just using standard C++ without any Microsoft specific APIs, then you can install gcc and use g++ to compile the application from the command line, or check out some of the IDEs for Linux, Anjuta and KDevelop are good C/C++ IDEs for Linux, there is also a C++ plugin for Eclipse
[09:38] <SilentDis> okt:  well, check in media, also, type mount without any command arguments to see what's mounted.
[09:39] <frogzoo> Okt: cd /media/USB*
[09:39] <tripppy> MistaED, abc channel only. ill move it to a antenna rather a rabbit set.
[09:39] <Ktracho> can some one PM me so i can show him the C++ code ?
[09:39] <MistaED> trippy: cool, i've found in the past that i needed to delete the $HOME/.kde/share/kaffeine directory to get it to work
[09:39] <Okt> frogzoo: showed up as "ipod"
[09:39] <Wiseguy> by the sounds of things even the people that do get them to work say it doesnt work very well... :S
[09:40] <MistaED> tripppy: that's for getting kaffeine to detect the tuner, but good that it's working somewhat for you :)
[09:40] <Canopus> Hi all
[09:40] <unimatrix9> Wiseguy, and the s-video out does not give very good image anyway
[09:40] <unimatrix9> even on Xp its sad
[09:40] <tripppy> MistaED, yeah, i bought it on ebay incl postage 30au!
[09:41] <Canopus> Any one of you upgraded to Edgy and his pc does not boot?
[09:41] <Wiseguy> unimatrix9, i wanted to use it just to watch movies...
[09:41] <Wiseguy> and output them on my tv
[09:41] <unimatrix9> Wiseguy, dont bother
[09:41] <SilentDis> canopus:  do you get an error?  does it make it to grub?  the usplash?
[09:41] <unimatrix9> Wiseguy, its blurry and not nice
[09:42] <unimatrix9> use an dvd player, or use your labtop
[09:42] <Canopus> SilentDis: it goes upto grub, I select the kernel and then no usaplash, error no theme for 640x480
[09:42] <unimatrix9> or use an beamer with the svg out
[09:42] <unimatrix9> hehe
[09:42] <Canopus> and it hangs
[09:42] <Ktracho> i have windows and ubunto on the same had drive can i share files like .mp3 ?
[09:42] <zcat[1] > unimatrix9: that's what I use my nvidia for.. the picture's as sharp as the DVD.. but still a lot less sharp than a monitor.

[09:45] <miyako> podr0znik, http://www.linuxreality.com/
[09:45] <zcat[1] > the easiest way is just dual-boot for your games and movies. WindowsXP is still way easier than linux for setting up multiple displays :(

[09:45] <we6jbo> and I'm going to get a new one. I want a motherboard that will run linux or actually ubuntu
[09:45] <arrenlex> podr0znik: xD!
[09:45] <miyako> no problem podr0znik

[09:47] <unimatrix9> w6jbo there seem to be motherboards out there that even come with an  linux distro bundled
[09:47] <seanj> i found a motherboard list on linux.com.. dont' know how up-to-date it is: http://www.linux.com/howtos/Hardware-HOWTO/motherboards.shtml
[09:47] <we6jbo> What I want is a motherboard that will run Ubuntu. I am going to go to Frys Electronics to get this motherboard and I know that they like Windows. Where can I get a list of motherboards that support linux or actually ubuntu which I will install onto my compute.
[09:47] <dabaR> Canopus: ya, I have an idea.
[09:47] <SilentDis> shadow_fi:  only ubotu is omnipotent, not the rest of us.  ask your question please :)
[09:47] <Shadow_Fi> I have Error 17 when booting with GRUB
[09:47] <frogzoo> !hardware
[09:47] <ubotu> For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
[09:47] <SilentDis> we6jbo:  i haven't herd of a mobo that DOESN'T work with linux.
[09:47] <Canopus> dabaR: Ok, may I know what it is?
[09:48] <we6jbo> Ok I did go to that website and I only see 9 motherboards that will work
[09:48] <frogzoo> !grub | Shadow_Fi
[09:48] <ubotu> Shadow_Fi: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[09:48] <dabaR> Canopus: edit the grub boot line, by pressing e on the option you want to edit when you get the grub menu. Then you will make it not load usplash, I will find how to do that.
[09:48] <danniy> how do i see my win partitions in ubuntu? sorry for being such a stress
[09:48] <Canopus> I tried that too
[09:48] <SilentDis> danniy:  are they ntfs partitions?
[09:48] <Shadow_Fi> First partition is NTFS primary, then extended 2 partitions, /home and swap, then primary linux partition, which i use as a boot
[09:48] <frogzoo> !ntfs | danniy
[09:48] <ubotu> danniy: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[09:48] <danniy> nope
[09:48] <danniy> fat32
[09:48] <Canopus> dabaR: I removed usplash from the end of line ... no result
[09:48] <danniy> cuz in ntfs linux cant write
[09:48] <macogw> they should be visible by default...
[09:48] <unimatrix9> Asus seems to be an good choice
[09:49] <arrenlex> !ntfs-3g | danniy
[09:49] <ubotu> danniy: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[09:49] <frogzoo> danniy: not true anymore
[09:49] <danniy> they are just there but when i try to open it sais the drive cant be mount
[09:49] <dabaR> Canopus: still says no splash image for that resolution?
[09:49] <SilentDis> danniy:  should be able to just mount it.  are you running IDE drives, or SATA drives?
[09:49] <we6jbo> SilentDis, the motherboard that I have right now which is a EIS motherboard states on their website that linux will not work and will not be supported which if I had been smart the first time and checked I would not have bought their motherboard
[09:49] <danniy> ide
[09:49] <Canopus> it says nothing ... just hangs does not boot
[09:50] <danniy> linux in on second ide
[09:50] <xarorax> hey
[09:50] <dabaR> Canopus: but does not complain about the splash image?
[09:50] <Shadow_Fi> how i should format my hdd?
[09:50] <miyako> well, night all
[09:50] <Canopus> it does not after I remove usplash from the command line.
[09:50] <zcat[1] > Yay, we can finally write ntfs.. what filesystem will Vista use? :(

[09:51] <dabaR> Canopus: but when you do it does not. OK. No idea what to fix then.
[09:51] <arrenlex> zcat[1] : Still ntfs. They dropped their plans for the next gen filesystem in order to be able to actually, you know, release it.
[09:51] <SilentDis> danniy:  you should be able to just mount it directly...

[09:57] <zch> frogzoo: well it was really hot here, so i took a big fan and pointed it to comp case to cool it down, it worked several months like that, and then it was so dirty that prolly some dirt made a shorcut somewhere and fried ps/2
[09:57] <SilentDis> danniy:  no, you're not.  just uninformed.  HUGE difference.  the fact that you're asking here is evidence of that :)
[09:58] <danniy> when i first installed my linux i could see the win partitions, but now i reinstalled it and nothing

[09:59] <arrenlex> !hi | Edulix
[09:59] <ubotu> Edulix: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:59] <frogzoo> !anyone | Edulix
[09:59] <ubotu> Edulix: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[09:59] <SilentDis> danniy:  if you have more questions, just ask.  if those don't help you... i'm sure someone here can walk you through editing /etc/fstab to do it automatically for you :)
[09:59] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> !Opera
[09:59] <ubotu> opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[10:00] <Edulix> the pakage is probably thought for debian and it wants me to install  libqt3c102-mt
[10:00] <arrenlex> Yay factoid flooding.
[10:00] <Waappu> Hi. Could you help me please? I can't get sound out of Haupauge WinTV PVR PCI. TV picture is fine.
[10:00] <arrenlex> Edulix: Yes, that is a debian package.
[10:00] <Edulix> arrenlex: how can I tell dpkg dtabase that it's already installed?
[10:00] <un_operateur1> Edulix, you can download the .deb from opera's repo and install it manually
[10:00] <Edulix> so that it doesn't complain
[10:01] <Edulix> un_operateur1: I'm sure. that's exactly what I did
[10:01] <Edulix> xD
[10:01] <SilentDis> waappu:  just to verify the basics:  most tv cards I've played with in the past require a 'bridge' to go to the soundcard.  either an internal connetor, or a shim deal.  is that installed?
[10:01] <Edulix> un_operateur1: the ubuntu package is still the old one
[10:01] <Edulix> not for 9.10 afaik
[10:01] <un_operateur1> Edulix, I just installed opera :)
[10:01] <Edulix> un_operateur1: which version?
[10:01] <Edulix> (check it!)
[10:01] <marc2> how can I find out the uuid of a disk? I just copied the contenst of one part, into another disk, and I am trying to run update-grub but I get findfs: Unable to resolve 'UUID=ce16fa55-3c82-45ca-8d7e-676c29229c1f'
[10:02] <Waappu> Yes , I have cable from board to CD connector and also loop cable from board to sound card line in
[10:02] <SilentDis> !uuid
[10:02] <ubotu> To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)

[10:02] <Edulix> no 9.10
[10:03] <un_operateur1> Edulix, its the latest .deb on operas repo
[10:03] <Edulix> which way do I tell to apt database that the package libqt3c102-mt is already installed ?
[10:03] <SilentDis> waappu:  and whatever TV app you're using has CD audio selected as it's source?  and the mixer doesn't have that muted?

[10:23] <chalcedony> arrenlex: opened abiword . unnamed file
[10:23] <arrenlex> chalcedony: File - open - browse to the file xP
[10:23] <chalcedony> i wonder if we could 'mv "nasty file name"
[10:23] <un_operateur1> . o 0 ( I dunno why he doesnt just use TAB )
[10:23] <arrenlex> chalcedony: Seriously, man, use tab completion.
[10:24] <lemao> I was able to get the excluding tree copy solution, but someone sugested that I use svn export instead, which i a lot cleaner.
[10:24] <chalcedony> arrenlex: abiword and i have a problem.. i moved to ubuntu from debian.. all my files are in "home" .. a thousand or so.. the gui  for abilword wont find the files
[10:24] <arrenlex> lemao: Oh, that wasn't you that was messing with opear. XD SOrry.
[10:24] <lemao> np
[10:25] <arrenlex> chalcedony: Why? It should. Does nautilus see them?
[10:25] <danniy> i cant edit the pmount.allow with gksudo.  WARNING: cannot open display
[10:25] <Thunder00> hello... how to search for a specific content of a file in a directory of files.
[10:25] <chalcedony> arrenlex:  i don't know if nautilus works . haven't tried it what's the command?
[10:25] <arrenlex> Thunder00: grep "foo" *
[10:25] <frogzoo> Thunder00: grep 'string'  *
[10:25] <un_operateur1> Thunder00,  grep -inHR <string> /path/to/files/*
[10:25] <arrenlex> chalcedony: ...you ARE gnome, right?
[10:26] <chalcedony> arrenlex: yes and i'm a mom
[10:26] <arrenlex> chalcedony: ...A gnome. xD
[10:26] <arrenlex> Wait.
[10:26] <arrenlex> IN
[10:26] <chalcedony> :)
[10:26] <arrenlex> IN gnome. Omg
[10:26] <Thunder00> thanks
[10:26] <prOMiNd> any know how to add new resolutions
[10:26] <prOMiNd> i have only 800x600 and 1024x768
[10:26] <prOMiNd> i need all resolutions..
[10:27] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> prOMiNd , get ur display driver installed?
[10:27] <arrenlex> chalcedony: You know, I think I knew that. Were you the one I said was pretending to be a girl to have the guys help her, or was that someone else?
[10:27] <frogzoo> !fixres | prOMiNd

[10:27] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ok no then....
[10:27] <chalcedony> gosh arrenlex i hope not
[10:27] <arrenlex> Good. :)
[10:27] <chalcedony> :)
[10:27] <danniy> the link u gave me for mounting win partitions doesnt work
[10:27] <arrenlex> Nautilus is the file manager... do you usually manage files from the command line?
[10:27] <chalcedony> arrenlex: yes
[10:28] <chalcedony> ls filename .. grep
[10:28] <prOMiNd> i need 1280 x 1024
[10:28] <arrenlex> chalcedony: Try running the "nautilus" command.
[10:28] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> i suppose u need drivers only in Windows world....
[10:28] <prOMiNd> ok
[10:28] <youser> hey i noticed in my firestarter active connections theres a service clled Auth running anyone know what thatis for?
[10:28] <un_operateur1> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, you need drivers in every world :)
[10:28] <arrenlex> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: I wish. Then things would actually work in Linux.
[10:29] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu>  un_operateur1 ,but linux ships thenm all>
[10:29] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ?
[10:29] <un_operateur1> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, no way
[10:29] <chalcedony> 6887 items 47.8 gb
[10:29] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> arrenlex , lol ...
[10:29] <youser> ive never seen it before but Auth doesnt sound too good
[10:29] <Rookie_> prOMiNd - open the file xorg.conf (/etc/X11) and see how its in that file, you can then add your res to what ever you want
[10:29] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> un_operateur1 , the only driver i installed uptill now is my graphics driver one ....
[10:29] <danniy> any other possibilities to mount win partitions?
[10:29] <arrenlex> chalcedony: a) wow, that is a LOT of files o_o b) where is that from?
[10:30] <zch> i found a solution
[10:30] <gnomefreak> !mount | danniy
[10:30] <un_operateur1> GreyGhost-Ubuntu, well, once you get out of the realm of the usual hardware into peripherals -- its a whole different story

[10:30] <zch> i broke kubuntu disk in half
[10:30] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> hmm.... Ubuntu auto mounts my Win partition at boot

[10:30] <gnomefreak> pradeep: im here
[10:30] <youser> anyone at all know what th service Auth is in my firestarter?
[10:30] <chalcedony> arrenlex: the bottome of the gui file thing
[10:30] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> un_operateur ,oh then ... it'll statrt coming to me in a few days...
[10:30] <un_operateur1> the lack of drivers on linux still is one of the reasons many people dont fully migrate over
[10:31] <arrenlex> chalcedony: Yes, but do you actually see any of the files?
[10:31] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: It's not our fault. Corporations release neither drivers nor specs. There's not a lot we can do in that situation.
[10:31] <arrenlex> HI yango!
[10:31] <evad> the lack of drivers /for/ linux, more like - Linux supports more hardware itself than any other OS ever
[10:31] <chalcedony> arrenlex: i see them .. it's going to take a long time to look at all of them
[10:32] <chalcedony> arrenlex: control f isn't doing so well
[10:32] <arrenlex> chalcedony: You don't need to look at all of them. Just go wherever you unzipped your tarball.
[10:32] <Rookie_> Tell the manufactors to make drivers for linux ... and it has to be free of charge ...
[10:32] <youser> what is Auth service????
[10:32] <un_operateur1> evad, are you being serious ?
[10:32] <evad> yes.
[10:32] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> !who are U?
[10:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about who are U? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:32] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> !help
[10:32] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[10:32] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ahh ..tahts the one... :)
[10:33] <arrenlex> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: !ubotu also works and is probably easier to remember.
[10:33] <chalcedony> arrenlex:   ~$ tar tf leftbehind09-23-06.tar
[10:33] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> arrenlex ,hehe k
[10:33] <frogzoo> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: you can also msg the bot so you don't spam the channel
[10:33] <un_operateur1> evad, if linux supports more hardware than any other OS -- it must mean drivers are readily available for any hardware under linux, but that just aint the case
[10:33] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> !ubotu
[10:33] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> oh k
[10:33] <arrenlex> chalcedony: That lists all the files in it. Did you actually unpack it?
[10:33] <chalcedony> yes
[10:34] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> frogzoo ,the usual /msg ubotu ?
[10:34] <frogzoo> GreyGhost-Ubuntu: sure
[10:34] <chalcedony> but the file names are messed up with spaces/
[10:34] <un_operateur1> if linux supported hardware like we dream it should -- everybody'd be using linux now
[10:34] <Temp_pennywise> i accidently removed madwifi from from /usr/src/linux-headers/drivers
[10:34] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> k
[10:34] <Temp_pennywise> how do i reinstall it
[10:34] <Lynoure> Rookie_: Actually, better if they released the specs, or open source drivers. Free of charge drivers can be pulled or not work with certain kernels.
[10:34] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Linux supports hardware like monochrome screens and the Tandy which nothing else supports anymore.
[10:34] <arrenlex> ...probably not tandy.
[10:34] <arrenlex> But things like that.
[10:34] <chalcedony> un_operateur1: ubuntu is a LOT closer to supporting most applications that people need
[10:34] <fredl> hi, can the mysql password in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf for debian-sys-maint be cleartext?
[10:34] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, errm yea .. linux was programmed on a monochrome :)
[10:35] <un_operateur1> chalcedony, applications != hardware
[10:35] <fredl> coz I'm trying to instal bugzilla and it says: DEBUG   - Opening a MySQL connection on DBI:mysql:;localhost;3306 with user debian-sys-maint...
[10:35] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: I'm just saying that Linux does support more hardware. It's just old hardware no one actually uses.
[10:35] <youser> aaaaaaaauthhhh?
[10:35] <fredl> DEBUG   - Failed to connect !
[10:35] <Rookie_> Well, many oldtimers dosent buy hardware that is not supported in linux ... that is a way too - force teh manufactors to port the drivers by not to buy the products
[10:35] <Rookie_> but this is way ot
[10:36] <arrenlex> Rookie_: The problem is that the Linux market is like 0.05%
[10:36] <arrenlex> Rookie_: You don't buy the hardware? They don't care. :)
[10:36] <chalcedony> un_operateur1: pay somebody to code your driver .. help out a starving student
[10:36] <arrenlex> Speaking of which, dammit, I should be studying for exams. -__-
[10:36] <chalcedony> increase the database of drivers available to everyone
[10:37] <fredl> arrenlex: you should ask the question differently. They indeed don't care if Linux users don't buy it. However, they do care if linux users DO buy it.
[10:37] <chalcedony> arrenlex: you are too good at helping :)
[10:37] <frogzoo> arrenlex: linux is like 10-20% of the server space these days
[10:37] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> rather ...get 120 GSoC projects for Ubuntu driver development....
[10:37] <Rookie_> on the servermarket linux and unix is about 23-26% worldwide
[10:37] <un_operateur1> chalcedony, if a student has some hardware that linux doesnt support he must have fancy hardware -- and then i'll find it hard to believe he/she is starving :)
[10:37] <chalcedony> hehehe
[10:38] <fredl> arrenlex, ask 'em "Do you care if you have .05% less sales?'" they'll answer 'nah'. Ask 'em "Do you want to sell 500k extra units?" they'll say 'yes'
[10:38] <un_operateur1> if students need linux drivers -- they can pay whoever-it-is themselves
[10:38] <chalcedony> i need to fix the filenames inside the untarred file ?
[10:38] <arrenlex> frogzoo: Have you noticed the kind of hardware problems people come here with? Video cards, sound cards, webcams... Servers don't have those. They have hard drives, ram, and NICs. Linux supports almost all variations of these.
[10:38] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> did Ubuntu have any GSoC projects this year>
[10:38] <Konnektion> thats so right
[10:38] <Konnektion> i only run linux on my server
[10:38] <youser> someone has to knwo wht Auth is
[10:39] <youser> i cant find much on sites
[10:39] <Konnektion> for a desktop its just easier to use windows *sigh*
[10:39] <GreyGhost-Ubuntu> ok ... found it thanks to ubotu
[10:39] <_goofy_> does anyone know of a  LVM with a gui
[10:39] <chalcedony> if arrenlex left.. can someone help me?
[10:39] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, well, thats partly because those hardware devices have standard interfaces to them -- also because there is little variance between one vendors product to another
[10:39] <frogzoo> arrenlex: as this is a support channel, it's not surprising people bring their problems here...
[10:39] <chalcedony> :)
[10:39] <arrenlex> chalcedony: There are 832 people. Someone always can. ;) However, what are you having problems with at the moment?
[10:39] <waldo> so i have edgy now... and my "networking" program doesnt allow me to see all available wireless networks... i have to manually enter/know the essid of the wireless network i wanna connect to... did they change "networking" or is my stuff fubared?
[10:39] <arrenlex> I lost the thread of the conversation.
[10:39] <youser> i like gnomes customzation
[10:40] <youser> !ubotu auth
[10:40] <Lynoure> youser: ident
[10:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about auth - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:40] <youser> ident?
[10:40] <element43> wow ubuntu rocks even with my ati card :)
[10:40] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Exactly. So the people who produce the hardware that doesn't run on Linux have no reason due because of little market share, and people who DO produce devices on Linux produce standard devices they can get anywhere else.
[10:41] <Lynoure> youser: it's most likely in port 113 and ident service, required by many irc networks, and some other things
[10:41] <youser> im trying to figure out what the service "Auth" is and why its running in my active connections
[10:41] <youser> it was running before i got on irc
[10:41] <youser> and ive never saw it run before
[10:41] <Lynoure> youser: I just told you. You can google on ident yourself for the details.
[10:41] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, i dont disagree with that -- infact thats what i've been trying to say
[10:41] <silent-networks> whats a good software that manages wireless networks under ubuntu
[10:41] <un_operateur1> :)
[10:41] <youser> thanks man
[10:41] <youser> or woman whichever you may be
[10:42] <silent-networks> any one ?
[10:42] <un_operateur1> silent-networks, iwconfig
[10:42] <Lynoure> youser: thanks for that correction :)
[10:42] <chalcedony> arrenlex: *hug* np. . i don't think this opened all the files into my regular directory.. i don't know how to fix the file names or move them since they names have those spaces in
[10:42] <zeissc> hi
[10:42] <element43> I know I could google this but I feel I should ask (because i don't care about writing atm) is it possible to mount and read from an NTFS drive?
[10:42] <Rookie_> !wifi
[10:42] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:42] <youser> lol youre welcome
[10:42] <silent-networks> i need a good gui to select available networks & so on
[10:42] <iwb4e> hi guy
[10:42] <Konnektion> you can mount a NTFS.. but writing is problematic
[10:43] <schlonzo> can anybody pls tell me which codec i have to download for aac playing?
[10:43] <arrenlex> chalcedony: Use nautilus to move them, or use tab completion from the command line -- start typing the first few characters of the filename and then press tab twice to have Linux complete the name.
[10:43] <element43> Konnektion, i don't want to write to it, just read from it
[10:43] <Konnektion> yea then you can mount it
[10:43] <waldo> schlonzo, to get all the codecs u need... try automatix2
[10:43] <frogzoo> !ntfs | element43
[10:43] <Konnektion> but off the top of my head i dont remember the comment
[10:43] <element43> yeah
[10:43] <chalcedony> arrenlex: i'll try
[10:43] <Konnektion> command*
[10:43] <element43> that is what i am asking for heh
[10:43] <schlonzo> i have automatix but aac still don`t work
[10:43] <ubotu> element43: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[10:44] <un_operateur1> chalcedony, ls -1 | perl -ne '$0=q|"$_"|;s/\s/_/g; `mv $o $_`'     ought to fix a filename
[10:44] <element43> CoolFox31, thanks
[10:44] <element43> bah
[10:44] <element43> stupid auto complete =)
[10:44] <un_operateur1> its a quickly contrived example -- might not work first time around
[10:44] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: ...what the hell does that do?
[10:44] <CharminTheMoose> I have a dell 1450 wireless usb adapter and Using ndiswrapper i can get the adapter to work but i can't when i use wep encryption.the wep is set at 10 character encryption
[10:44] <zch> someone unban me
[10:44] <waldo> so i have edgy now... and my "networking" program doesnt allow me to see all available wireless networks... i have to manually enter/know the essid of the wireless network i wanna connect to... did they change "networking" or is my stuff fubared?
[10:44] <un_operateur1> arrenlex,fixes the space problem with a file
[10:44] <zch> i said the f word ... and got perma banned, gimme a break
[10:44] <gephalt> Hi, I need some help configuring Xinerama with Twinview.
[10:44] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Yes, I got that. How?
[10:44] <Shi> hi
[10:45] <un_operateur1> arren -- part by part ok ...
[10:45] <gephalt> is it possible to view video in full screen on one monitor without getting it 'spilled' into the other?
[10:45] <po0f> schlonzo: faad?
[10:45] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: No, just tell me what it is supposed to end up with.
[10:45] <un_operateur1> $0=q|"$_"|;   -- quotes the original filename
[10:45] <waldo> gephalt,  yes
[10:45] <rage> Weird, are Core 2 Duos 64bit?
[10:45] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: I give this thing the file "I am a file.mp3". What's the output?
[10:45] <gephalt> waldo: so how do I do it- geforce 4
=== Tigge_ is now known as Tigge
[10:45] <un_operateur1> I_am_a_file.mp3
[10:46] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Is that it?! XD
[10:46] <arrenlex> OMG
[10:46] <un_operateur1> hopefully atleast
[10:46] <waldo> gephalt, i cant remember how i did it before... u have to edit your xorg im pretty sure
[10:46] <un_operateur1> let's try it out in a shell
[10:46] <arrenlex> un_operateur1 : tr " " "_"
[10:46] <arrenlex> xD
[10:46] <gephalt> waldo: brb
[10:46] <CharminTheMoose> I have a dell 1450 wireless usb adapter and Using ndiswrapper i can get the adapter to work but i can't when i use wep encryption.the wep is set at 10 character encryption
[10:47] <waldo> anyone know why my atheros card worked with airodump and all related apps under dapper... but under edgy it wont?
[10:47] <waldo> it wont go into monitor mode now
[10:47] <malt> does my ftp ask anyone for a login or does it work at all? ftp://test:test@m4lt.com
[10:48] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, form a complete expression with tr :) xX
[10:48] <zch> someone unban me, latest ban added, kthx
[10:49] <rage> malt: I get a connection, but the user/pass doesnt work
[10:49] <CharminTheMoose> zch,if you're banned why can you talk?
[10:49] <youser> lmao
[10:49] <zch> because i joined via proxy
[10:49] <youser> permabanned even
[10:49] <CharminTheMoose> ouch
[10:49] <youser> ive never been banned andive swore in here
[10:49] <frogzoo> oh dear...
[10:49] <un_operateur1>  perl -ne 'chomp; $o="\"$_\""; s/ /_/g; `mv $o $_`;'    << a bit better
[10:50] <youser> but i didnt badmouth kubuntu
[10:50] <po0f> un_operateur1: If you call Perl better...  ;)
[10:50] <arrenlex> (pwned)
[10:50] <un_operateur1> perl is better :)
[10:50] <Temp_pennywise> i accidently removed madwifi from from /usr/src/linux-headers/drivers. How do i reinstall it?
[10:50] <youser> nothing beats murrine
[10:51] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: How did you install it?
[10:51] <hcz> ok so i said the f word after wasting 3 hours with stupid kubuntu bugs and i get perma banned, and now someone is getting of on banning me, fine that's really helpfull
[10:52] <youser> yeah that does suck
[10:52] <hcz> i mean you cant really ban me, i can come here again and again, but i wont bother.. so feel free to reban me again
[10:52] <youser> i once tried forliek 8 hours to get beryl towork
[10:52] <frogzoo> hcz: I think the usual protocol is to ask for the unban from #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:52] <thamwa> hey,how can i check my cpu infor in ubuntu (am a new ubuntu user)
[10:52] <youser> only to find out  my comp couldnt run it
[10:52] <arrenlex> un_operateur1 : you're right, it didn't turn out much better x_x
[10:52] <arrenlex> ls | while read a ; do mv "$a" $(echo $a | tr " " "_") ; done
[10:53] <un_operateur1> :)
[10:53] <po0f> thamwa: `cat /proc/cpuinfo` from a terminal.
[10:53] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, i donr remember.... ; p
[10:53] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: But I think it looks a bit better than your monstrosity. xD
[10:53] <waldo> anyone know why my atheros card worked with airodump and all related apps under dapper... but under edgy it wont go into monitor mode... what gives?
[10:53] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: Did you have to apt-get anything to install it?  Just reinstall it then.
[10:54] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, my monstrosity is faster than yours :)
[10:54] <frogzoo> waldo: just a guess - did you upgrade from dapper, or fresh install?
[10:54] <waldo> fresh
[10:54] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: Yes but mine doesn't look like a dollar sign factory exploded.
[10:54] <nevron> in which channel can i learn howto configure my dual screens?
[10:54] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, Thats what i think. But i donr remember what I installed...
[10:54] <apokryphos> !xinerama | nevron
[10:54] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, yea, it's just a different dialect of line noise :)
[10:54] <ubotu> nevron: xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[10:54] <christiane> Hello. When I boot the script /etc/init.d/cryptdisks finishes with an error "wrong passphrase" but it doesn't ask me. When I later do the same from runlevel 2 it works. Any idea?
[10:55] <thamwa> po0f,thanx
[10:55] <nevron> no i shouldnt use xinerema since it disables 3d accelleration
[10:55] <BlackHawk> hi
[10:55] <un_operateur1> arrenlex, mine actually uses one dollar less than yours :)
[10:55] <po0f> thamwa: Did you find what you were looking for?
[10:55] <thamwa> yap
[10:55] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: apt-cache search madwifi
[10:55] <arrenlex> un_operateur1: At the expense of like five slashes.

[11:07] <arrenlex> ...wtf was that? o_O
[11:07] <po0f> hax
[11:07] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, ok :)
[11:08] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: How did you install your video card drivers?
[11:08] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, had to download from nvidia
[11:08] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: Let me guess NVIDIA beta drivers?
[11:08] <willskills> ah right, so the beta drivers should be ok?
[11:08] <gephalt> arrenlex: you mean wid?
[11:08] <__ghost__> ciao
[11:08] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, dont think they are beta...
[11:08] <arrenlex> gephalt: Yeah.
[11:09] <willskills> which driver you got Temp_pennywise ?
[11:09] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: 96xx?
[11:09] <arrenlex> gephalt: Hi, here's my email, bye. <--- o__O
[11:09] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, 9631
[11:09] <gephalt> yeah- lol- cause he's new.
[11:09] <dromer> hmm, I want mt-daapd to be able to use port 3689 but how do I know if that port is open ?
[11:09] <ski-worklap> telnet localhost 3689
[11:10] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: AFAIK, >96xx are beta, but I have been proven wrong on many an occasion.  ;)
[11:10] <ski-worklap> if you can type at it or it says something to you, it's being used
[11:10] <dromer> telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
[11:10] <ski-worklap> then it's open
[11:10] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, haha ok ;p Should i download it and reinstall ti ?
[11:10] <ski-worklap> you're freaking welcome.
[11:10] <gephalt> How does jsp compare to server-side languages like php/asp?
[11:10] <dromer> ski-worklap: and when it's closed ?
[11:11] <po0f> Temp_pennywise: I think you should be fine.
[11:11] <Temp_pennywise> po0f, ok :)
[11:11] <ski-worklap> sorry i meant open like "available", not open like "in use"
[11:11] <Temp_pennywise> brb
[11:11] <christiane> Is there anything missing in runlevel 1 (Ubuntu 6.10) that prevents cryptsetup to ask for a passphrase in the shell?
[11:11] <ski-worklap> connection refused means nothing is listening there, so you are free to use it for something else (ie its open), even tho any connection there is immediately closed
[11:12] <ski-worklap> that is a weird bit of terminology isn't it.
[11:12] <dromer> haha yeah :P
[11:12] <po0f> Or the port is just blocked.
[11:13] <dromer> how can I open it ?
[11:13] <po0f> dromer: It should be available, I was just adding my 2 cents.
[11:13] <dromer> ok .. hmm
[11:13] <dromer> I can't find the server though
[11:14] <dromer> maybe cause I'm on the localhost atm
[11:14] <ski-worklap> uhh
[11:14] <ski-worklap> you're always "on the localhost
[11:15] <dromer> yes ok, but compared to the server
[11:15] <ski-worklap> on the srver, 127.0.0.1 is the server
[11:15] <dromer> when on a different pc I'm not on the servers host
[11:15] <ski-worklap> on your machine, 127.0.0.1 is your machine
[11:15] <feihung> Help, nothing after splash screen
[11:15] <dromer> I want the daap-server to share music with another pc
[11:15] <ski-worklap> feihung, you shouldn't have splashed the screen then
[11:16] <arrenlex> Well, goodnight, all.
[11:16] <christiane> When boot process has reached runlevel 2 executing `/etc/init.d/cryptdisks start` works and it asks for a passphrase. Why is the passphrase dialog not shown on bootup? (There's just the error msg "wrong passphrase".)
[11:17] <TheKittenEater> Anyone awake? Heh. I need a little help here, I'm really new to Ubuntu and Linux in general. I just installed 6.06, but there's a little problem. My laptop has a 15" Widescreen, but the only resolution options are for 5:4 Monitors. I'd like to use 1280x800, any ideas?

[11:22] <ski-worklap> nothlit, man chflags
[11:22] <christiane> TheKittenEater: Are you on Ubuntu (Gnome) or Kubuntu (KDE)?
[11:22] <IntToStr> oh ya, it gave me this msg in 6.06, while trying to mount root
[11:22] <ski-worklap> nothlit, nevermind that, i'm thinking freebsd
[11:22] <TheKittenEater> Ubuntu 6.06
[11:23] <nothlit> ski-worklap, do you know whether debugfs is supposed to be used live or mounted ro? or from a livecd?
[11:23] <christiane> TheKittenEater: So try to open a terminal (there must be a menu entry)
[11:23] <ski-worklap> IntToStr, did you do an upgrade or a fresh install?
[11:23] <gephalt> I have a problem using twinview (nvidia geforce4 - on AGP)- when I try to watch a movie in full-screen it spills into my monitor.
[11:23] <ski-worklap> nothlit, no idea
[11:23] <gephalt> how can I fix it?
[11:23] <TheKittenEater> Got it.
[11:23] <IntToStr> fresh install
[11:23] <gephalt> i've already edited the config file according to the online guides- and its not helping
[11:24] <christiane> TheKittenEater: Type `sudo -s` (without the ``)
[11:24] <javiolo> hi
[11:24] <TheKittenEater> Yup.
[11:24] <christiane> TheKittenEater: and enter your pw.

[11:25] <ken_> Hello people, i need to edit the xorg.conf file to stop the NVIDIA SPLASH SCREEN from displaying. But when i use the command "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf", i get a message in terminal saying "ken@ken-desktop:~$ gksudo gedit /etc/x11/xorg.conf
[11:25] <christiane> TheKittenEater: `nano /etc/apt/sources.list`

[11:25] <TheKittenEater> Yup.
[11:25] <apokryphos> ken_: faulty gksudo. Use plain sudo for *just* this instance.
[11:26] <ken_> apokryphos: what is faulty gksudo? And why does it happen only for me?
[11:26] <apokryphos> ken_: it doesn' thappen only for you. It happens for many
[11:26] <apokryphos> and it means that there's a bug in gksudo
[11:26] <ken_> apokryphos: And what are the disadvantages of using "sudo" in every graphical program?
[11:26] <apokryphos> ken_: no, just for this instance I said: just gedit
[11:27] <apokryphos> I don't think it does any harm to gedit, but with other programs you can get a lot of problems
[11:27] <IntToStr> is there any command in shell, that i can use to check problem?
[11:27] <ken_> apokryphos: Thank you for your timely elp.
[11:27] <ken_> *help
[11:27] <christiane> TheKittenEater: look for a line taht ends with "universe" and remove the "#" at the beginning

[11:44] <jpjacobs> IntToStr, yes you need a bootable flag on the partition where /boot resides. Also it is very usefull to have a seperate /home partition
[11:44] <IntToStr> ok, so set up a /boot, a /home?
[11:44] <christiane> TheKittenEater: I found this wiki that should help you: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide
[11:45] <jpjacobs> no, you prolly don't want a seperate /boot

[12:05] <Curs0r> very well mr. terse bot when i make a remote connection to my machine with an xdmcp client applications that use gtk take a long time to load but they work fine after, other apps take no meaningful time to load
[12:05] <gephalt> Problem is when using full screen, it spills into the second screen
[12:06] <gephalt> nothlit: there. i've stated the problem first- we'll see how it works :P
[12:06] <lydgate> how exactly is ubuntu desktop's alsa configured by default? it seems it uses esd? dmix? what? i want to duplicate this on my install
[12:06] <nothlit> Curs0r, well the gtk libs have to load
[12:06] <Infeliz> lots of questions but no answers
[12:06] <|markie|> nothlit: amen to that
[12:06] <gephalt> yeah- all duds in here right now :D
[12:06] <Poncio> pomoze ktos?
[12:07] <Curs0r> does it have to load them for each app, and every time an app loads?
[12:07] <nothlit> gephalt, spill into, or uses both lol
[12:07] <|markie|> i am trying to install ubuntu by using Xen. Xen is up and running, only i have no idea how to create a VM
[12:07] <nothlit> Curs0r, should just have to load it once
[12:07] <nothlit> !xen
[12:07] <ubotu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy
[12:07] <Curs0r> not the case
[12:07] <nothlit> |markie|, the xen website has a good howto
[12:07] <gephalt> gephalt: yeah- `spill`'s a bit dramatic, i guess. IT uses half of both screens-
[12:08] <Curs0r> each app that uses gtk takes the same amount of time to load even after one has already been loaded
[12:08] <nothlit> Curs0r, you said they work fine after
[12:08] <gephalt> i thought i could live with resizing it- just turns out that when i try to do that- the movie falls is not in proportion
[12:08] <po0f> Curs0r: Can you prove that a lib is being reloaded?
[12:08] <nothlit> Curs0r, and what are the other apps?
[12:08] <Wooksta> is there a tutorial somewhere for getting flash to work on 64bit edgy?
[12:08] <nothlit> gephalt, most video players can  lock aspect ratios
[12:08] <|markie|> nothlit: is it a "must" to have a graphical interface running before using xen at all ?
[12:08] <Curs0r> well if your answer is that the libs have to load isn't that the conclusiont hat follows?
[12:09] <nothlit> |markie|, I don't think so
[12:09] <spitz> Hi all
[12:09] <nothlit> Curs0r, could you please elaborate on your situation, and include names of specific apps?
[12:09] <gephalt> nothlit: that doesnt sound right- lemme search the ubuntuforums first.
[12:10] <po0f> Curs0r: XDMCP is X over network right?  And all the rpocessing is being done on one box right?  Is the box doing anything else besides being a remote X server?
[12:10] <|markie|> nothlit: i tried to find the website of xen, only i think i found the wrong one
[12:10] <Curs0r> monodevelop, gnibbles, gaim, gedit, gnome-terminal, apps that use gtk, get the picture?
[12:10] <unfun> Do I have to uninstall gnome before installing xubuntu-desktop?
[12:10] <po0f> unfun: No.
[12:10] <nothlit> Curs0r, what are the 'other' apps that load so fast
[12:10] <unfun> thank you
[12:11] <gephalt> Curs0r: anyone noticed how unstable oowriter is? especially when you try to insert images into a document?
[12:11] <nothlit> Curs0r, and after the first gtk app loads... is it all smooth sailing from here? or do you have the same issue after logout? what?
[12:11] <po0f> unfun: Use aptitude to install xubuntu-desktop so you can uninstall it all at once should you choose to do so.

[12:12] <gephalt> yeah, i use kaffeine- so let me try and see.
[12:13] <nothlit> Curs0r, oh, i'm sorry I can't remember the solution to that problem
[12:13] <nothlit> Curs0r, you can try googling, or i'm sure someone will know it offhand here if you wait long enough

[12:51] <nevron> ok i ll try that i hope this one works po0f thanx for the idea

[01:21] <Alarm> for example: PATH=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0/bin:$PATH
[01:21] <po0f> Alarm: add "PATH=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0/bin:$PATH" to ~/.bashrc and you should be fine.
[01:21] <Jowi> Jaak_, you put the script (or the link to it) in /etc/init.d then you create a link from /etc/init.d/myscript to /etc/rc2.d/S90myscript
[01:22] <compengi> hi gnomefreak
[01:22] <nothlit> PATH doesn't do anything, its a variable
[01:22] <Alarm> okie
[01:22] <Jowi> Jaak_, or something similar to that. see if your app isn't already in /etc/init.d first. if it is you can run "sudo update-rc.d myscript defaults"

[02:01] <Zodiac|Linux> how to install vlc?
[02:02] <serioussven> afternoon, I can't seem to find the GTK-2 Dev package, I allready enabled the multiverse.
[02:02] <xitrox> sudo apt-get install vlc
[02:02] <Zodiac|Linux> then it needs: "libgnutls12"
[02:02] <QwertyM> Zodiac|Linux, sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-*
[02:03] <kekko> ma qua s parla sl in inglese?
[02:03] <QwertyM> apt-get will get the dependency for you

[02:03] <kekko> help me for synscan
[02:03] <serioussven> never mind, libgtk was my answer...
[02:04] <nevron> please some one tell me where to find ati open surce drivers
[02:05] <QwertyM> Russel, for HT / Dual cored machines - sudo apt-get install linux-686-smp
[02:05] <Russel> thx
[02:06] <nevron> come on there are 910 people here can you please tell me where to find the open source ati drivers?
[02:06] <QwertyM> Russel, remember, you need to reinstall nvidia drivers if you have a card of theirs
[02:06] <QwertyM> for the specific kernel again
[02:07] <Russel> k...
[02:07] <Spitz_2> nevron: They are normally already installed on your system I think. Just edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf & change 'vesa' to 'radeon'
[02:08] <blue-frog> nevron: synpatic is a good place to look for things
[02:09] <nevron> how would it be listed
[02:09] <blue-frog> nevron: search for fglrx
[02:09] <any> hi
[02:09] <nevron> i searched for ati and radeon but couldnt find anything
[02:09] <knight> hi.. is rc.local executed after gettys?
[02:09] <nevron> ok i have the fglrx but i dont want to use it
[02:09] <kekko> configure: error: libdnet not found
[02:09] <nevron> will fglrx let me run aiglx?
[02:10] <frogzoo> nevron: the ati drivers in the stock repos are open source
[02:10] <any> Why is the version of the fglrx driver never the same as the kernel module ?
[02:10] <frogzoo> nevron: the closed source is called fglrx
[02:10] <knight> hi guys.. is rc.local executed after gettys?
[02:11] <knight> is dere any man page for rc.local???
[02:11] <nevron> i have installed fglrx
[02:11] <vook> How would I go about limiting system resource usage on a process (cpu time, memory, etc...)?

[02:13] <zeroGraph> Anyone know something about ACLs in Ubuntu? Can't find something decent to read.
[02:13] <vook> I ask for debugging purposes.  A process keeps spiraling out of control, going into a loop, taking up 100% of cputime.  How could I limit such a process to only 10% of system resources when it goes into this endless loop?
[02:13] <vook> short of using a VM, that is.

[02:14] <qos> hey foks
[02:14] <qos> folks :)
[02:14] <nevron> ok they say that edgy is already shipped with aiglx
[02:14] <sebest> hello anyone know why nautiluse doesn't want to delete folder created like this: mkdir toto && sudo chown nobody:nogroup toto
[02:14] <frogzoo> zeroGraph: you may also like eiciel - acl's under nautilus
[02:14] <nevron> i have beryl and is i can run it through xgl but how do i create a session of aiglx
[02:14] <shinobi2> are people going to update repository for dapper?  vim 7 is not there
[02:14] <zeroGraph> frogzoo Oh, justr tho
[02:14] <blue-frog> sebest: you are not owner of the folder
[02:14] <sebest> blue-frog i'm the owner of the parent
[02:15] <sebest> and i can delete it using the shell
[02:15] <sebest> mkdir toto && sudo chown nobody:nogroup toto && rmdir toto  <- works
[02:15] <blue-frog> sebest: sudo chown nobody:nogroup toto,  you are owner of toto?
[02:15] <sebest> blue-frog i'm not the owner of toto, but i'm the owner of the parent folder of toto
[02:15] <zeroGraph> frogzoo: *sorry, Enter key is too big*, I'm still reading about this so I don't know everything - but shouldn't ACL be workiung by default, and I mean ACLs, not the standard filerights system.
[02:16] <qos> something killed my alsa system. i can't use "aplay <file>" to play a wav file... it always says that there is an error during opening the audiodevice. with root rights i can use the command.
[02:16] <nevron> how do i start an aiglx session
[02:16] <sebest> blue-frog, give it a try in your home dir
[02:16] <vook> sebest: it doesn't matter if you are the owner of the parent.  If you own /home/myuser, and root owns /home/myuser/folder, you cannot remove folder.
[02:16] <frogzoo> zeroGraph: oh they're there in the filesystem, but with no tools, you can't access them
[02:16] <blue-frog> sebest: indeed and nautilus deletes it perfectly..
[02:17] <vook> sebest: you want NIS or active dirschmectory if you want permissions to propogate.
[02:17] <sebest> vook : i think you can
[02:17] <frogzoo> sebest: of course you can delete toto, as long as you created in your home, wont' work in /tmp though
[02:18] <wasp_ems> is there a simple application i can add to see my ram usage?
[02:18] <nothlit> That's because /tmp has a stick bit set
[02:18] <zeroGraph> frogzoo: Thanks, been reading about how they should work in a book, but when they didn't I got confused :) So it's alright then.
[02:18] <wasp_ems> like system monitor is for cpu?
[02:18] <nothlit> sticky*
[02:18] <sebest> frogzoo, yes that's why /tmp has the sticky bit
[02:18] <malt> http://www.m4lt.com/~c0rk/uploaded/cvcv.bmp, why will my apache server not open that bmp file like that rest of the images like jpg
[02:18] <sebest> but my nautilus doesn't want to delete such file
[02:18] <wasp_ems> found it ok
[02:18] <frogzoo> sebest: so what's your problem?
[02:19] <frogzoo> zeroGraph: ...AND you need to mount the filesystem with the 'act' option
[02:19] <vook> sebest: oops, you are right
[02:19] <sebest> frogzoo, my problem is that nautilus doesn't want to remove such folders
[02:19] <frogzoo> zeroGraph: s/act/acl
[02:19] <sebest> frogzoo : it display a little lock on the icon and refuse to delete it
[02:20] <lardarse> which forum section is the best to look in for information on getting dual monitor setups to work?
[02:20] <frogzoo> sebest: ok, it's a bug
[02:20] <blue-frog> sebest: use the delete function of nautilus not the move to trash
[02:21] <sebest> blue-frog, i don't have a delete option in the right click menu
[02:21] <frogzoo> sebest: nautilus won't do it for me (edgy)
[02:21] <lardarse> sebest: shift+delete
[02:21] <blue-frog> sebest: edit/preferences/behavior
[02:21] <vook> sebest: I've experienced what you are experiencing.  At one point I added something to .bashrc to chown everything back to me.me in my home directory and recursively at login, but it became too cumbersome.
[02:21] <blue-frog> sebest: include delete command
[02:21] <sebest> shift+delete works
[02:21] <frogzoo> sebest: oh you know why this doesn't work ?
[02:22] <zeroGraph> frogzoo: Hmm, is there a step-by-step guide you know of?
[02:22] <sebest> frogzoo, because it tries to move it
[02:22] <sebest> ?
[02:22] <frogzoo> sebest: because nautilus doesn't delete - it moves, & you don't have rights to create a nouser file
[02:22] <dark-shadow> whats a good media player that plays DVD, mp3 & mpeg/avi/wmv
[02:22] <blue-frog> sebest: and shift del  is the equivalent of the delete submenu
[02:22] <sebest> but IMO, this is definitly a bug, it should tell me it can't move it and propose to delete it
[02:22] <wasp_ems> for some reason my cpu goes very easily to 100% and my ram shows 38% used by programs and 61% by cache..any ideas why this might be happening?
[02:23] <saharaab> hi all
[02:23] <vook> sebest: eh, I almost recall bringing something like this up in #gnome once.  I think that is by design.
[02:24] <blue-frog> dark-shadow: vlc
[02:24] <frogzoo> wasp_ems: it's typical for linux to use unused ram for cache - but the high cpu is not good - try 'top' or 'htop' to pin down the guilty process
[02:24] <sebest> vook: but it should be fixed, it's quite annoying :)
[02:24] <dark-shadow> with gui ?
[02:24] <blue-frog> dark-shadow: yes
[02:25] <vook> I prefer gnome over the others asthetically at least, but I do recall having problems with nautilus in the past.  I recommend the shell for all file functions, or if really daring, midnight commander.  Otherwise, fear the wrath of the kde people.
[02:25] <wasp_ems> frogzoo, after i go into top..how do i see which one is using the more cpu?is it supposed to be the first one?
[02:25] <vook> sebest: I hear ya.
[02:25] <jrib> !players | dark-shadow
[02:25] <ubotu> dark-shadow: Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[02:26] <dark-shadow> which is the best that joins all formats , almost like a media player performs on winblows
[02:27] <jrib> dark-shadow: I don't think there really is one, use one of the audio players to keep a music library and use a video player to play your videos
[02:28] <dark-shadow> thx
[02:28] <gephalt> what application can i use to edit .pdf files-
[02:28] <zeroGraph> dark-shadow: Vlc is very nice, handles pretty much everything, exists as a windoze version aswell
[02:28] <gephalt> like creating bookmarks- that sorta thing
[02:28] <gephalt> evince doesnt seem to do that
[02:28] <dark-shadow> thx all, vlc it is
[02:28] <knight> ubuntu rules... bye
[02:28] <zeroGraph> dark-shadow: think the package name is wxvlc
[02:29] <frogzoo> wasp_ems: if you press 'P' top will sort by cpu
[02:29] <gephalt> anyone?
[02:29] <wasp_ems> frogzoo, thanx
[02:29] <gephalt> there's the adobe reader version on linux- wonder whether acrobat is available
[02:30] <frogzoo> gephalt: wine might be an option
[02:30] <frogzoo> !appdb | gephalt
[02:30] <ubotu> gephalt: Appdb is a database of apps & help for programs that run under wine: see http://appdb.winehq.org
[02:30] <zeroGraph> gephalt: From what I've heard, (note: don't know for sure), you need a special Adobe program to actually _edit_ .pdf files.
[02:30] <Saturnus-irc> Anybody know how to change the settings for gnome terminal (xterm)? By default the gnome terminal shows the path to the folder you're in, and it makes it quite unreadable if you're deep inside the three-structure.
[02:30] <Duesentrieb> hi all - i have a problem with alsa; I have been trying to install a manual build of it to make it work with my soundcard. it didn't go well, so i triewd to --reinstall all the alsa stuff using apt.
[02:30] <Duesentrieb> but now, the kernel module snd_hda_intel is no longer foun
[02:31] <Duesentrieb> i musst be missing something, or messed something up badly.
[02:31] <Duesentrieb> so.... how can i fix this?
[02:31] <gephalt> if wine works- i'll use the acrobat copy i use in windows. :)
[02:32] <jrib> Saturnus-irc: $PS1 gets set in ~/.bashrc, that's what you want to edit.  Google for "bash prompt customization" (maybe)
[02:32] <frogzoo> Saturnus-irc: set PS1 in ~/.bashrc
[02:32] <Duesentrieb> Saturnus-irc: the prompt is handeled by the shell, not the terminal. It is controlled using the $PS1. Look into the bash manual, search fro "prompt".
[02:32] <Duesentrieb> bah, too late :)
[02:33] <Duesentrieb> anyway - if modprobe doesn't find a module, what could be wrong? it should be installed - how can i check?

[02:45] <minimec> Hi. It's the first time I have to install some Nvidia drivers for a linux system. My question: Should I use the 'official linux-restricted-modules from the restricted repo or the 9629 nVidia driver I found here http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA#Installing_from_repository ?
[02:45] <rm_you> I did an updatedb, and then tried to locate a couple of them.... they appear on my system, but in the asm-powerpc/ directory.... but this mac uses an intel chip, and asm/ is correctly linked to asm-i386/, which does not have the right includes
[02:46] <Duesentrieb> jrib: yea, it's in there. guess it got removed when installing the manual alsa build.
[02:46] <jrib> Duesentrieb: yeah
[02:46] <jrib> minimec: usually, you will want to use the version in the repositories
[02:46] <oskude> rm_you: is there souce code you try "tweaked" for intel based macs ?`(is there like an option in configure or so)

[02:48] <niekie> frogzoo, ok, I'll have a look.
[02:48] <oskude> rm_you: hmm, then thats odd... it definetly is looking in the wrong place for the file... now its the question "who" is doing this, the code or "ubuntu"
[02:48] <nevron> ok people here is the dilemma i want to run aiglx with edgy eft and i have the fglrx drivers but aiglx needs the composite enable option which if i enable it i loose my 3d acceleration so am i rigt about thinking that there is no way for me to run beryl using aiglx?
[02:49] <LinTux> What Antivirus for linux
[02:49] <testsusf> hello im trying to figure out the script that checks the filesystem.. and im woundering.. what maked the files /fastboot and /forcefsck im currently looking at the checkfs.sh script in /etc/init.d/
[02:49] <minimec> jrib: thx. Well I would like to have some kind of 3d Desktop. Well with my ATI Card I have to use XGL in combination with beryl. So the '9629 driver' is the patched one?
[02:49] <rm_you> oskude: the code.
[02:49] <frogzoo> niekie: you probly just need to install alsa-oss
[02:49] <rm_you> oskude: It has #includes to <asm/of_device.h>, for example
[02:49] <testsusf> do anyone know
[02:49] <niekie> frogzoo, I did that before, did not work.
[02:49] <wasp_ems> i have setup my printer but i when i print no ink comes onto the paper anyone know why?
[02:49] <A-L-A-R-M> i've created a shortcut of an application on my desktop. when i run it from the shortcut the application doesnt work properly and instead of loading java, it loads gij4.1 and doesnt allow me to end the application, just to kill it . on the other hand when i run the application from terminal it loads normaly . whats wrong with the shortcut ?
[02:49] <niekie> frogzoo, the problem is quite odd.
[02:50] <brasileiro> Hi, I've installed a lib from a package.deb, whay will happen if I install the new version using the source?
[02:50] <niekie> On reboot, sound doesn't work anymore, unless I make sure /var/lib/alsa/asound.state is removed and then reboot.
[02:50] <rm_you> oskude: so I guess your theory that it was written expecting to be compiled on a ppc mac makes the most sense of anything i've found so far...
[02:50] <oskude> rm_you: well, im not familiar with that project, so you maybe have better change to talk with the people who code it...
[02:50] <jrib> minimec: you don't install nvidia drivers for ati cards.  I'm not really sure what you need for ati.  Check with the people at #ubuntu-xgl
[02:50] <MUTU-windows> Hi... any idea how I can free some memory on an almost dead machine? I've been waiting for half an hour to switch to the firefox window so that maybe i'd be able to close it and free some memory.
[02:50] <MUTU-windows> The titlebar hasn't even come up yet
[02:50] <niekie> MUTU-windows, hold on a moment.
[02:51] <brasileiro> Hi, I've installed a lib from a package.deb, what will happen if I install the new version using the source?
[02:51] <jpjacobs> MUTU-windows, kill some things...
[02:51] <frogzoo> niekie: also, rm, or move aside, ~/.asoundrc if it's there
[02:51] <testsusf> hmm hmm hmm
[02:51] <Duesentrieb> jrib: ok, module loads, still no sound. Just like the last 4 months :(
[02:51] <rm_you> oskude: yeah, I'm emailing him
[02:51] <spitz> Hi, I just compiled kernel 2.19 but when I try to boot it, I got this error : /dev/sda1 does not exist. Dropping to shell Does anyboyd now what it means? I've got SATA 250Gig, Intel Core Duo ( I took 686 isntead of 386 in paramet to compile kernel)
[02:51] <MUTU-windows> jpjacobs: i'm tryign to kill firefox... but it won't switch to the firefox window. the mouse moves every 10 seconds
[02:52] <jpjacobs> switch to a VT , log in, type killall firefox-bin <enter>
[02:52] <Duesentrieb> MUTU-windows: hit ctrl-alt F2
[02:52] <minimec> jrib: I will not install any ati stuff on that Laptop ;) I one heared, that there is a patched driver, and that you can use beryl without aiglx or xgl with nvidia cards. So I guess that the driver from the 'beryl-wiki' is the patched one.
[02:52] <oskude> MUTU-windows: ctrl+alt+f7 gets you back to x windows
[02:52] <MUTU-windows> jpjacobs: how do i switch to a VT? sorry i'm a noob :)
[02:52] <Duesentrieb> MUTU-windows: that switches you to a virtuel terminal (text mode). log in, then type "killall firefox"
[02:53] <jpjacobs> what Duesentrieb says
[02:53] <MUTU-windows> ah ok thanks
[02:53] <ken_> I need to compile a software KTOON, and the 'ubuntu-documentation' is not helping. Is someone willing to take me through the steps?
[02:53] <ken_> please?
[02:53] <minimec> MUTU-windows: killall firefox-bin is better ;)
[02:53] <jrib> minimec: I think you confused me.  Are you talking about two different systems: one that has an ati card and one that has an nvidia one?
[02:53] <Duesentrieb> ken_: for most "tarballs", unpack, go to directory, type ./configure && make && make install
[02:54] <mmholguin008836>  hola
[02:54] <brasileiro> Hi, I've installed a lib from a package.deb, what will happen if I install the new version using the source?

[02:54] <ken_> Duesentrieb: on doing ./configure i get "ken@ken-desktop:~/Desktop/ktoon-0.8$ ./configure
[02:54] <ken_>  *  You're using Qt 3
[02:54] <ken_>  *  Please install Qt >= 4.1 or set QTDIR to Qt4 installation path

[02:54] <niekie> He might also try calling oom_kill if the system is really stuck and he can't switch to a console.
[02:54] <jrib> brasileiro: what lib are you talking about?  It could be harmless... it could make programs not work...
[02:54] <Duesentrieb> brasileiro: you will confuse the package management (it will think you still have the old version). When you use the package manager to update later on, it may not remove the "manual" stuff cleanly
[02:54] <minimec> jrib: I am using different linux systems with Ati cards, all running with xgl or aiglx. Now I have a new Laptop with a geforce 7600, that I have to install as a christmas present ;)

[02:55] <brasileiro> jrib, wxWidgets
[02:55] <brasileiro> Duesentrieb, so I need to wait until the package be released?
[02:55] <ken_> Can someone please help me?
[02:55] <jrib> minimec: ah ok, yeah.  The driver they link on the beryl wiki is the beta driver and it provides those patches you were describing.  But remember it is still beta
[02:55] <BigToe> amarok won't play any files but flash player and totem will. how do I fix it?
[02:55] <brasileiro> Duesentrieb, I'm using Edgy, there's any problem if I install a Dapper package?
[02:55] <BigToe> when I open it in terminal I get "X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 168
[02:55] <BigToe> "
[02:56] <jrib> ken_: have you read the wiki page on compiling?
[02:56] <ken_> jrib: yes
[02:56] <Duesentrieb> ken_: it's telling you that you need a newer version of Qt. Also note that you'll have to install the *-dev package in addition to any new qt packages.
[02:56] <jrib> ken_: you need the qt dev packages
[02:56] <Duesentrieb> brasileiro: it will tell you if there are conflicts.
[02:56] <ken_> jrib: Do i get them from Synaptic?
=== BigToe is now known as TehBigToe
[02:56] <minimec> jrib: So you would prefer the official ubuntu one and use aiglx in combination with beryl?
[02:56] <TehBigToe> amarok won't play any files but flash player and totem will. how do I fix it?
[02:56] <eia768> hi all, i wanna know why ubuntu dapper LTS still has scilab broken
[02:56] <CactusWiZaRd> !distupgrade
[02:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about distupgrade - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:56] <brasileiro> Duesentrieb, ok, I'll try.. thanks ;)
=== igor_ is now known as igcek
[02:57] <eia768> so many complains and nothing is done
[02:57] <ken_> jrib: Duesentrieb: i downloaded the just now from Synaptic but the installer says i need higher version. Where do i get them from?
[02:57] <jrib> minimec: well, the nvidia driver will give you a lot better performance... I use it
[02:57] <eia768> or wxmaxima...it is still broken
[02:57] <minimec> jrib: So use the driver described on the beryl-wiki site?
[02:57] <spitz> I don't wanna push, but does nobody has an answer for my question ?
[02:58] <jrib> ken_: install did you install qt4 dev packages?
[02:58] <eia768> how long LTS get to upgrade a broken package with many users complain?
[02:58] <reverseblade> Can I make my broadcom wireless and nvidia work with 64 bit ? are there drivers for this ?
[02:58] <jrib> minimec: yes, that's what I would do, but keep in mind it's beta.  I've had some lockups
[02:58] <CactusWiZaRd> how to upgrade 6.06 to 6.10?
[02:58] <ken_> jrib: i installed the qt-dev packages in Synaptic, but they seem to be old for the installer, as it tells me i need a higher version of qt
[02:58] <jrib> ken_: how about libqt4-dev ?
[02:59] <reverseblade> eia768, I'd like to state my "personal" opinion about LTS, if you like to listen
[02:59] <jrib> !upgrade | CactusWiZaRd
[02:59] <ubotu> CactusWiZaRd: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[02:59] <TehBigToe> amarok won't play any files but flash player and totem will. how do I fix it?
[02:59] <jrib> eia768: how is it broken?
[02:59] <Duesentrieb> TehBigToe: if using gnome, make sure amarok is not configured to use arts
[02:59] <eia768> reverseblade , please tell me...
[03:00] <TehBigToe> how do I do that Duesentrieb?
[03:00] <minimec> jrib: ok. I'll give it a try,  i guess ;) Thx for your explanations...
[03:00] <A-L-A-R-M> tried to install webmin but i get error of missing libraries webmin depends on libnet-ssleay-perl; however:
[03:00] <A-L-A-R-M>   Package libnet-ssleay-perl is not installed.  . and other libraries as well. how can that be fixed ?
[03:00] <Duesentrieb> TehBigToe: i don't know. somewhere in the config dialog, i expect.
[03:00] <dv5237> hi, what do i need to install after a server install if i want to run a minimalized xorg on it?
[03:00] <ken_> jrib: I am downloading that library. That one is BIG. Moreover which library would i need to use the 'checkinstall' command? Right now, checkinstall is unrecognised
[03:00] <spitz> Is 2.6.19 standard dpm?
[03:00] <TehBigToe> ok
[03:00] <eia768> jrib  , wxmaxima dont work, socket problem. and scilab works with alien font :-)
[03:00] <TehBigToe> thanks
[03:00] <adaptr> spitz: standard what ?
[03:01] <spitz> is it Intel Core Duo compatible?
[03:01] <spitz> cause maybe I didn't install the right kernel?
[03:01] <spitz> and that could be the reason it chrashes
[03:01] <adaptr> spitz: any Linux kernel since oh.. 2.2 or something is SMP-capable
[03:01] <TehBigToe> I asked the question in #amarok
[03:01] <TehBigToe> they said <Russel> TehBigToe: look out how to enable mp3 for xine in your distro
[03:01] <adaptr> spitz: which kernel did you install ?
[03:01] <eia768> what do you guys think about LTS? is it a good thing or not?
[03:02] <TehBigToe> how do I enable mp3 for xine?
[03:02] <jrib> eia768: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/defoma/+bug/3496  check if wxmaxima has a bug report as well
[03:02] <spitz> I installed 2.6.19
[03:02] <adaptr> eia768: it is essential for my servers
[03:02] <apokryphos> TehBigToe: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[03:02] <reverseblade> eia768, Dapper was huge improvement internally to the prior version. But it took longer time they expected. I assume there were a lot of problems they encounter during the development. Although, dapper is long term supported, edgy is far better then dapper in every way. I suggest you to move on with edgy. And I might be wrong, these are my personal opinions ,as I told
[03:02] <Duesentrieb> TehBigToe: if it playes otehr files but mp3, then they are right. if it doesn't play any sound, do as i said.
[03:02] <spitz> adaptr: because my radeon X1300 doesn't work on 'standard ubuntu kern'l
[03:02] <Duesentrieb> TehBigToe: also, if it doesn't have an mp3 lib, it should tell you. it shouldn't just be silent.
[03:02] <adaptr> spitz: that's not nearly enough information.. post the output of "uname -a"
[03:03] <testsusf> Help me
[03:03] <adaptr> spitz: video support has little or nothing to do with the kernel
[03:03] <apokryphos> !helpme

[03:03] <paranoia16> is it possible to try out kde in ubuntu?
[03:03] <jrib> !kde | paranoia16
[03:03] <ubotu> paranoia16: KDE (http://kde.org) is the K Desktop Environment. To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop", or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE for other ways to get KDE

[03:03] <eia768> reverseblade , i am thinking about it... maybe i upgrade this week.. i am not sure yet
[03:03] <nivek> Hi. Im having problems burning a cd with k3b. I ran k3b first through the menu, but it said it had no permission to the device. So i started it through the terminal using sudo, it hasn't given me any errors, but its just not burning it. Its been at 0% for 5 mins now, Any ideas?
[03:03] <reverseblade> eia768, specifically  edgy should have been the one with LTS not dapper.
[03:03] <spitz> adaptr: The output is Linux desktop 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Tue Dec 5 22:26:18 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux,
[03:03] <dv5237> hi, what do i need to install after a server install if i want to run a minimalized xorg on it?
[03:03] <jrib> apokryphos: I think I'm going to start using that too
[03:04] <adaptr> spitz: that is not an SMP kernel - go to Synaptic and install the proper one for your system
[03:04] <adaptr> spitz: also, its ooold
[03:04] <apokryphos> jrib: it's good since it helps people help themselves more. 90% of faqs are there.
[03:04] <spitz> adaptr: but I  isntalled 2.6.19 but that doesn't boot ( this error : /dev/sda1 does not exist
[03:04] <paranoia16> if i install kubuntu desktop, can i switch back to gnome? how would i do that?
[03:04] <Duesentrieb> parabolize: you can set the desktop to use on the login prompt.
[03:04] <apokryphos> paranoia16: at the login screen you can select which one you want to go into
[03:04] <adaptr> spitz: nobody said you should use 2.6.19, I have the latest for dapper, which is 2.6.17.25-50
[03:04] <reverseblade> paranoia16, in the splash sceen, click options/session etc, and you will find your choices
[03:04] <eia768> nivek, maybe u have to be on the "burn" group... try to execute k3b as root and see the setup
[03:05] <nivek> eia768, thats why i tried it with using sudo
[03:05] <testsusf> So.. can anyone help me ?
[03:05] <reverseblade> !ask | testsusf,
[03:05] <ubotu> testsusf,: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:05] <spitz> adaptr: Sorry ( I 'm newbie ) but how can I remove the 2.6.19 kernel & update my current?
[03:05] <fenrig> how can i install the new openoffice

[03:06] <reverseblade> fenrig, check it out if there is a new release in backports or search this in forums. if last, you may consider compiling from the source which is not hard. Finally you might wait couple of months also
[03:06] <testsusf> apokryphos apparantly not
[03:06] <starz> with those stats im getting loads of 3.7 just running firefox this and totem
[03:06] <eia768> not a problem

[03:07] <starz> why is edgy so load intensive etcetcetcetc
[03:07] <adaptr> spitz: sorry, my kernel is 2.6.15.25-50; you should use that one too: 2.6.15.25-50-686, which has SMP support for P4 and up
[03:07] <reverseblade> testsusf, try pasting your question every 5 min. and try channels like #linux as well
[03:07] <eia768> hey guys.. how was the upgrade from dapper? was it clean and fast? was it trick?
[03:07] <adaptr> spitz: as for tye Radeon - you'd have to find out what the problem *is*, first
[03:08] <spitz> adaptr : Ok, I will do that, but first I would like to clean the 2.6.19 kernel, and how can i update from 2.6.1 to 2.6.15
[03:08] <nivek> eia768, according to the group settings, my user has 'cd-drive' access. There is no specific 'burn group' listed.
[03:08] <reverseblade> eia768, I haven't done it but, I have seen many people suffered for it. If it is an option consider backing up your data and doing a fresh install, which should not be hard at all
[03:08] <adaptr> spitz: you have to run A kernel, so you'd best leave cleaning out the 2.6.19 to after you installed another one
[03:09] <eia768> reverseblade. are u using dapper?
[03:09] <adaptr> spitz: just install the one I recommended form synaptic, and reboot to use it, then you can delete the old one
[03:09] <adaptr> spitz: don't forget to install restricted-modules for it!
[03:09] <spitz> adaptr: The problem is posted here ( In dutch, but you will see important things between [code]  tags ... ) In short: fglrxinfo gives spits out Generic instead of X1300
[03:09] <adaptr> spitz: I can read Dutch... when I concentrate
[03:10] <spitz> adaptr: Here it is http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_message/27100185#27100185
[03:11] <eia768> reverseblade, do u still use dapper?
[03:11] <reverseblade> eia768, no of course not
[03:12] <testsusf> Hey im trying to figure out the script that checks the filesystem.. and im woundering.. So What Are | Makes the files /fastboot and /forcefsck im currently looking at the checkfs.sh script in /etc/init.d/ ???
[03:12] <adaptr> spitz: are you running dapper or edgy ?
[03:12] <spitz> adaptr: In wich repository I can find the kernel?
[03:12] <reverseblade> eia768, as I told, dapper was a huge improvement. But edgy is superb. Stable fast, recognizes all hardware, it is perfect
[03:12] <spitz> adaptr: Edgy
[03:12] <eia768> lol
[03:13] <reverseblade> eia768, fiesty will be even better with new kernels
[03:13] <frogzoo> testsusf: forcefsck is just a file to touch if you want to check your drives next boot
[03:13] <dv5237> hi, what do i need to install after a server install if i want to run a minimalized xorg on it?
[03:13] <adaptr> spitz: the kernels are in main, search for linux-image
[03:13] <reverseblade> eia768, I am gonna install fiesty in 1h, which is at alpha stage
[03:14] <spitz> adaptr: btw, thank you for helping me

[03:34] <jpjacobs> ata, it is much much better to install packages by hand. it's as simple as setting the right sources.list (www.ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic) and searching the packages in synaptic

I have tried chmod to 777 but I get : 'chmod: changing permissions of `/media/LACIE/': Read-only file system'. How can make the FS write-enabled? Thanks

[03:36] <oskude> Zodiac|Linux: you can allso ask your machine with: locate xorg.conf
[03:36] <kane77> gizmo_the_great1, what fs is it formated to?
[03:36] <ata> gizmo: i'd guess the drive is formatted with ntfs, which is read-only
[03:36] <Zodiac|Linux> oskude, thx
[03:36] <gizmo_the_great1> i will have a look and get back to you in 10 seconds
[03:37] <Zodiac|Linux> ata, thx
[03:37] <CalJohn> gizmo_the_great1: look up fuse and ntfs-3g and poke
=== dou213_ is now known as dou213
[03:37] <CalJohn> gizmo_the_great1: that's if it's ntfs
[03:37] <gizmo_the_great1> it is FAT (vfat)
[03:37] <gizmo_the_great1> I am able to copy files to it no problem, but it won't let me delete files out of the wastebaket
[03:38] <kane77> gizmo_the_great1, have you tried "sudo" removing it?
[03:38] <gizmo_the_great1> kane77: I have indeed, yes
[03:38] <gizmo_the_great1> kane77: same error
[03:39] <gizmo_the_great1> kane77: let me try via terminal
[03:39] <gizmo_the_great1> kane77: hang on
[03:39] <ata> if chmod is saying "read-only filesystem", it seems weird that you'd be able to copy files to that drive...
[03:39] <kane77> gizmo_the_great1, OK..
[03:40] <whyameye> is it possible to mount a remote filesystem through ssh from the command line so that my apps can access the remote filesystem as if it were local (i.e.. even if they do not support a remote filesystem protocol they can read and write files to the remote system)?
[03:40] <frogzoo> gizmo_the_great1: what's the line in fstab ?
[03:40] <ata> jpjacobs: thanks. I'll use aptitude instead.
[03:40] <gizmo_the_great1> kane77: nope. Same error. I cd'd to to .Trash-ted, executed 'sudo rm *' and it came back with a list of entries like this : 'rm: cannot remove `xpti.dat': Read-only file system'

[03:41] <age6racer> Hi all, I have a probelm with my desktop running Ubuntu 6.10. A couple of days ago it started acting funny, when inside a gnome session it takes forever to read from my root drive (the one that the OS is on) but it's still really quick with the other drive (which I use for storage)
[03:41] <gizmo_the_great1> frogzoo: there is not an entry preent. It was auto mounted during boot up.
[03:41] <CalJohn> whyameye: yes it is, but you'd be better off using nfs (if it supports encryption) rather than ssh
[03:41] <gizmo_the_great1> frogzoo: is that the problem?
[03:42] <claudio> hi to all...i've bought a Trust WB-1400T webcamera... it works with camorama but colours are not the right ones...what can i do? I've seen that it's a PAC207-BCA based Cameras....please help me
[03:42] <AlexC_> grrr, How can I disable SHIFT+Backspace to restart X ? I've lost so so so much work because I accidently hit it
[03:42] <age6racer> I'm pretty sure it's not the hardware becuase Ubuntu still boots just as fast as it used to. Its just when inside gnome that it's slow.
[03:42] <whyameye> CalJohn: ok thanks. I was also looking at sshfs...

[03:44] <adaptr> AlexC_: then that is something you enabled yourself, since the default is ctrl-alt-backspace
[03:44] <LjL> dv5237: i suggest "xorg"
[03:44] <elkbuntu> AlexC_, a. dont repeat the question so quickly, b. put this into a terminal: xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
[03:44] <CalJohn> AlexC_: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=312072
[03:44] <dv5237> LjL: not xserver-xorg?
[03:45] <adaptr> dv5237: what ubuntu are you running ? chances are you already *have* gnome
[03:45] <AlexC_> adaptr: that's what I thought, but I havn't enabled anything to do that.
[03:45] <LjL> dv5237: no, that won't give you all that is needed i'm afraid
[03:45] <adaptr> AlexC_: running beryl or compiz ?
[03:45] <age6racer> Anyone ever had this slow read probelm before?
[03:45] <dv5237> adaptr: server installation so im whitout xorg atm

[03:45] <AlexC_> elkbuntu: sorry, it said the message couldn't be sent or something like that before so
[03:45] <dv5237> LjL: ok thats a good point do i need to install more? for fonts or something like that?
[03:46] <LjL> dv5237: if you get xorg, i think the basic fonts are included

[03:48] <tuqann> regardless, I removed all those instances from the files, I used ctrl-h to get to the hidden files, still tries to find the proxy everytime I use apt-get
[03:48] <kane77> !worksforme
[03:48] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[03:48] <LjL> tuqann: what you maybe you've also set a proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf?
[03:48] <tuqann> first place I went to
[03:49] <gizmo_the_great1> frogzoo: so I think that means that the mount is assigning me as the autorised person to use it? As both report UID as 1000, and 1000 = ted?
[03:49] <csalsb> anybody out there that can help with vmware issues
[03:49] <paranoia16> what is the terminal command to remove a dir?
[03:49] <tuqann> etc/apt/apt.conf, also .bashrc, wgetrc in a number of folders (in etc and in my profile folder)
[03:49] <gizmo_the_great1> paranoia16: rm -r I think
[03:49] <LjL> tuqann: what happens now exactly when you try to apt-get update?
[03:49] <csalsb> I have it installed and every time I run it I get the message to run vmware-config.pl
[03:49] <Lord_Shadow> rm -r
[03:49] <frogzoo> gizmo_the_great1: I think the umask should be 4 digits (ie umask=0077) - I'd try giving the disk a line in /etc/fstab (with the noauto option)
[03:49] <oskude> paranoia16: rmdir (for empty dirs)
[03:49] <frogzoo> paranoia16: rmdir
[03:50] <gizmo_the_great1> frogzoo: I will have a go at that and let you know. Give me 5 :-)
[03:50] <tuqann> nothing, it says "connecting to xxxxxx.proxy" and it times out
[03:50] <LjL> csalsb: then run it :-) consider there's vmware-player ready to run in the official repositories (although now that you've installed another version manually, i suppose it might not work that smoothly)
[03:50] <lafielle> Hi, how do I get a program to autostart?
[03:50] <lafielle> preferably without having to resort to the commandline.
[03:50] <apokryphos> !autostart
[03:50] <ubotu> To add programs to start up when you log into your Gnome session https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup
[03:50] <LjL> tuqann: xxxx.proxy being the proxy you had originally set up, i suppose?
[03:50] <lafielle> cheers!
[03:50] <frogzoo> lafielle: sys -> prefs -> session
[03:51] <testsusf> frogzoo
[03:51] <tuqann> yes, my university proxy
[03:51] <LjL> tuqann: make sure everything has gone away by doing "echo $http_proxy $HTTP_PROXY"
[03:51] <csalsb> i am trying to run it but it won't start everytime I go to run it I get that message after I have configured it already
[03:51] <testsusf> i cant find out what makes thouse file.. can you point me to the script that does?
[03:51] <unimatrix9> i thought you could add it to gnome to autostart
[03:51] <LjL> tuqann: and, if that shows nothing, try sudo sh -c "echo $http_proxy $HTTP_PROXY"
[03:51] <Jussi01> I have a quick question...I might be blind, but does anyone know where in beryl you can change what a window does when you double click on the top headline bar? Ie. i want it to go from maximised to the smaller size instead of rolling up..can anyone help?
[03:52] <frogzoo> testsusf: as I said, /forcefsck is created by the user
[03:52] <ubuntu_> hola
[03:52] <tuqann> bash: http://usr:******@proxy.aub.edu.lb:3128/: No such file or directory
[03:52] <lafielle> Perfect, thanks.
[03:52] <LjL> Jussi01: i think it's in the Emerald settings
[03:52] <ubuntu_> gente como esta
[03:52] <LjL> !es | ubuntu_
[03:52] <testsusf> frogzoo whrere?
[03:52] <ubotu> ubuntu_: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[03:52] <ubuntu_> hola gente como esta
[03:52] <testsusf> frogzoo, and how
[03:52] <LjL> tuqann: wait, that's when using which command?
[03:52] <frogzoo> testsusf: that's the full path 'sudo touch /forcefsck'
[03:52] <LjL> ubuntu_: english here please. /join #ubuntu-es for spanish
[03:53] <tuqann> what you just write me, echo $.....
[03:53] <ubuntu_> electron19_12@hotmail.com
[03:53] <Jussi01> LjL thanks a lot you are correct!!
[03:53] <malt> what is the command to see disk space usage of a users directory?
[03:53] <lafielle> Question 2: Is firestarter the preferred firewall manager for ubuntu?
[03:53] <testsusf> frogzoo your not making any sence
[03:53] <testsusf> *sense
[03:53] <LjL> frogzoo, testsusf: wasn't following, but "shutdown -F -r now" will restart the computer *and* perform a filesystem check when it reboots, without touching files manually
[03:53] <frogzoo> lafielle: well, some people prefer raw iptables
[03:54] <LjL> tuqann: ok then either those settings you removed haven't really gone away, or you're still inside a shell that had them enabled - try starting a *new* shell and trying apt-get again
[03:54] <testsusf> no no no no..
[03:54] <lafielle> frogzoo: well, for the layman :)
[03:54] <testsusf> in what script does that touch /forcefsck
[03:55] <LjL> tuqann: and if that fails, try     export HTTP_PROXY=          and       export http_proxy=
[03:55] <kosnick> can i format a drive as ntfs through ubuntu? i got ntfs-3g already
[03:55] <frogzoo> lafielle: you could do much worse - firestarter is fine
[03:55] <tuqann> I closed all instances of terminal and started a newone (ctrl + ~) but I still get this
[03:55] <tuqann> how can I start a clean new shell
[03:55] <thompa> my be browsing is slowed down for some reason, what is the configuration to check in firefox?
[03:55] <Renu_> kane77 i install kdetv but is not working
[03:56] <frogzoo> tuqann: accessories -> terminal
[03:56] <kosnick> tuqann : just by typing the name of it , if i remember correctly
[03:56] <Navyseal> anyone know about visual basic? need some help
[03:56] <jrib> tuqann: this = ??
[03:56] <thompa> there is about a 20 sec. delay for a page to load
[03:56] <malt> is there any command in ubuntu to see current bandwidth usage?
[03:56] <LjL> tuqann, try the echo commands above
[03:56] <LjL> tuqann: i mean export
[03:56] <testsusf> frogzoo, from where does 'sudo touch /forcefsck' get executed?
[03:56] <frogzoo> Navyseal: you won't have much luck with VB here soz
[03:56] <testsusf> what scrit
[03:56] <testsusf> *script
[03:56] <Renu_> is any body from eateurope who is using a tvtuner?
[03:56] <Renu_> on ubuntu?
=== mio is now known as dellorino
[03:57] <Navyseal> frogzoo :( where can i find ?
[03:57] <frogzoo> testsusf: a human enters those keystrokes into a terminal window and executes them
[03:57] <oskude> malt: i like "iptraf", not installed by default... (if you wanted a cli tool)
=== Navyseal is now known as camuflage
[03:57] <malt> oskude: no command to see bandwidth at all of ethernet card?
[03:58] <malt> for example this like
[03:58] <malt> Downstream: 4.17 KBytes/s  Upstream: 0.07 KBytes/s
[03:58] <testsusf> frogzoo you have no idea what im talining about
[03:58] <Renu_> is anybody from easteurope to show me howto see on a tvtuner?
[03:58] <Balachmar> Hi, can someone help me to find to cause of system crashes?
[03:58] <tuqann> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[03:58] <tarzeau> Renu_: where exactly?
[03:58] <tarzeau> Renu_: just use tvtime?
[03:58] <Renu_> romania
[03:59] <tuqann> sometimes I get this, after a couple of terminal "close and start again" I go back to the proxy problem
[03:59] <testsusf> frogzoo, take a a look at /etc/init.d/checkfs.sh about like 35
[03:59] <dv5237> LjL: it cant find package xorg i already uncomment the stuff in sources.list
[03:59] <lafielle> frogzoo: thanks.
[03:59] <LjL> dv5237: i guess you're on dapper
[03:59] <dv5237> LjL: correct :)
[03:59] <lafielle> I'm adding firestarter to my autostart list.. Should I add it as 'gksu firestarter' ?
[03:59] <frogzoo> tuqann: the http_proxy variable can be set through sys -> prefs -> network - that can trip you up
[03:59] <oskude> malt: did you try iptraf ? (i have to admin, havent used/needed it for a while)
[04:00] <lafielle> That appears to be what's listed in the launcher icon's properties.
[04:00] <LjL> dv5237: in that case, use "x-window-system" instead
[04:00] <kkaisare> Does anyone use galeon or epiphany here?
[04:00] <Renu_> tarzeau hoto use tvtime?
[04:00] <adaptr> malt: dozens
[04:00] <Renu_> where is it?
[04:00] <frogzoo> lafielle: nope - just click the box that says autostart
[04:00] <tuqann> okay, finally worked
[04:00] <dv5237> LjL: ok will do
[04:00] <unimatrix9> tvtime needs to be installed
[04:00] <snakeman> how can I connect to my WPA access point?
[04:00] <Renu_> ok
[04:00] <tuqann> I have no idea when the terminal decides to take it or not, but for whatever reason now it works
[04:00] <LjL> tuqann: i'd restart X (just to be very sure...) and check that it still works. if it doesn't, it means the proxy settings are still there in some file or another
[04:01] <tuqann> let's just hope that the next time I want to setup the proxy it won't be as bad!
[04:01] <lafielle> frogzoo: in firestarter or in the session manager?
[04:01] <tuqann> thanks for the help a million
[04:01] <tuqann> have a nice day
[04:01] <lafielle> frogzoo: clicking add leads to a browse button.
[04:01] <frogzoo> tuqann: the terminal inherits the gnome http_proxy env variable - once you set it, new terminals will inherit it
[04:01] <dv5237> LjL: couldnt find that either..
[04:01] <dv5237> LjL: i cant find xserver-xorg though
[04:01] <dv5237> s/cant/can
[04:01] <testsusf> frogzoo so if you did take a look.. i'll ask you again.. from where does thouse 2 files come from
[04:02] <frogzoo> lafielle: it's in firestarters options - to autostart (but it will start iptables at boot, even when the gui's not showing)
[04:02] <LjL> dv5237: uhm what the heck... let me look around a bit. i'm on edgy myself :\
[04:02] <lafielle> frogzoo: ah, I'll have another look. Thanks.
[04:02] <testsusf> i mean,, from where do they come | make  from
[04:02] <tuqann> thanks fo rhte tip
[04:02] <tuqann> I'll write that somewhere for future references
[04:02] <dv5237> LjL: sure thanks for looking.. i can find x-window-sytem-core...
[04:03] <lafielle> frogzoo: firestarter options has a 'start firewall on program start up'; nothing related to 'system startup' from what I can see.
[04:04] <malt> i just want something simple where i type a command and it shows me current down speed traffic and current upload speed traffic
[04:04] <frogzoo> lafielle: that will do fine  - that's just to create the icon in gnome
[04:04] <tuxub> hi, is it possible to add a new custom location to gnome weather
[04:05] <frogzoo> tuxub: right click -> prefs -> location
[04:05] <tuxub> frogzoo, that locations are fixed...
[04:05] <yuv656> malt: install nload from synaptic, and then type nload at the terminal
[04:05] <frogzoo> tuxub: well then you'll need to read the code
[04:05] <tuxub> frogzoo, i need to add a new one that is supported by weather.com...
[04:06] <lafielle> frogzoo: hmm, so I don't actually need firestarter to be running for preexisting rules to be enabled?
[04:06] <oskude> malt: sorry, ive only used iptraf... maybe you can get that with "netstat" or catting something in /proc/net
[04:06] <LjL> dv5237: i think your best bet is x-window-system-core -- though that's weird enough
[04:06] <yuv656> malt: nload will do the trick
[04:06] <lafielle> frogzoo: in other words, I only need firestarter to change rules (not to actually run the firewall)
[04:06] <lafielle> ?
[04:06] <tuxub> frogzoo, you mean, reading the source code and recompiling the app?
[04:06] <frogzoo> lafielle: the way to check is, without logging into gnome, from a terminal try 'sudo iptables -v' & you'll see a bunch of rules if the firewall is working
[04:07] <LjL> dv5237: i can tell you that there's no other package which depends on xbase-clients (which is the very basic X programs), so that must be the most complete X metapackage in Dapper
[04:07] <frogzoo> tuxub: I doubt recompiling's necessary, it's probly a python app
[04:07] <lafielle> frogzoo: ok, thanks.
[04:07] <Balachmar> Hi, can someone help me to find to cause of system crashes? I suspect a hardware problem
[04:07] <Balachmar> But I don't now how to locate it
[04:08] <frogzoo> Balachmar: first check /var/log/messages
[04:08] <dv5237> LjL: what xbase-clients or x-window-system-core?
[04:08] <LjL> dv5237: x-window-system-core provides xbase-clients, so i think you should install x-window-system-core
[04:08] <LjL> dv5237: that x-window-system-core exists while x-window-system doesn't feels weird to me... but oh well
[04:09] <Canopus> Hi all
[04:09] <Canopus> can anyone tell me how to mount other partitions when in rescue mode
[04:09] <dv5237> LjL: i configered xorg.conf but how can i start x? startx command not found
[04:09] <malt> yuv656: what is the command for nload
[04:09] <malt> once installed
[04:09] <yuv656> malt: nload
[04:09] <malt> oh i see
[04:09] <malt> lol
[04:10] <ollekalle> question: anyone know a good quide for tweaking tv-out performance?
[04:10] <LjL> dv5237: if you install x-window-system-core, you will get startx
[04:10] <mutu310> How do I change my keyboard input language please?
[04:11] <frogzoo> Canopus: 1st mount / rw  'mount -o remount,rw /'   then you should be able to just 'mount /var' or whatever
[04:11] <tuxub> frogzoo, i found this /usr/share/gnome-applets/gweather/Locations.xml
[04:11] <tuxub> frogzoo, maybe its this ;)
[04:11] <dv5237> LjL: ok will do now..
[04:11] <dv5237> LjL: do i need to config xorg.conf myself or will it be done?
[04:12] <LjL> dv5237: these are the packages that x-window-system-core adds to a simply xserver-xorg: http://apt.byethost14.com/?repo=Dapper&arch=i386&package=x-window-system-core&have=xserver-xorg  <- if you look, there's 'xinit' cited. that provides startx (you can see there are also fonts and the basic X libraries)
[04:12] <Canopus> forgzoo: you mean 1st mount -o remount, rw / and then mount /boot
[04:12] <LjL> dv5237: i think it'll be done automatically - but you said you already made one, so i don't think it'll be touched again
[04:12] <LjL> dv5237: you can always do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[04:12] <dv5237> LjL: ok nice thanks
[04:14] <frogzoo> Canopus: if you have a separate /boot
[04:14] <dv5237> LjL: ill keep you updated :)
[04:14] <Canopus> ok
[04:14] <Canopus> thanks
[04:14] <phildard> hello
[04:14] <phildard> al
[04:15] <unimatrix9> hi
[04:15] <GreyGhost> !hi
[04:15] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:15] <phildard> i have just install ubuntu
[04:15] <lafielle> q3: This system is a sempron box with 384 MB RAM and has an S3 trio onboard graphics chipset (VIA). The graphics are generally sluggish. The card appears to have been detected OK, but do I have to enable 3D support or something?
[04:15] <phildard> with the alternate version
[04:15] <lafielle> Pardon my ignorance, but I'm new to all this..
[04:15] <GreyGhost> phildard ,yes?
[04:15] <phildard> but i gnome no lauch
[04:16] <tuqann> exit byebye
[04:16] <phildard> and i'm in text mode
[04:16] <GreyGhost> lafielle , glxinfo | grep renderer
[04:16] <Balachmar> What is the difference between the alternate and the desktop cd?
[04:16] <Balachmar> Because I have read that sometimes the alternate is better?
[04:16] <phildard> and my question is how to install gnome in text mode?
[04:16] <oskude> !alternate > Balachmar
[04:16] <zeeed> hi, I have problem with iptables, I put iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT in start script, but I still can't be pinged :( why?
[04:16] <unimatrix9> lafielle s3 trio is not an very nice video card, if you could it would be nicer to get an second hand nvidia card for a few bucks, or maybe some one you know has one in an drawer somewhere
[04:17] <phildard> i have already install with apt-get, gdm and xorg
[04:17] <faeryNatsuki> hello
[04:17] <unimatrix9> the s3 runs even bad on xp
[04:17] <GreyGhost> phildard ,even with alterante GNOM<E should install ... it did for me atleast...
[04:17] <minerale> apt-cache & apt-get are giving me seg faults, I ran a strace and they seem to be dying at this line: "stat64("/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_main_binary-i386_Packages", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=5491154, ...}) = 0" -- anyone know what it means ?
[04:17] <faeryNatsuki> how can i make kde sound system starts at beginning of system? it's not working ind cuirrntly i have to do it manually
[04:17] <oskude> zeeed: afaik, ping is not rejected by ubuntu as default...
[04:17] <lafielle> GreyGhost: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x46
[04:17] <lafielle> OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI UniChrome (K8M800) 20060710
[04:17] <GreyGhost> !alternate | Balachmar
[04:17] <ubotu> Balachmar: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[04:18] <lafielle> unimatrix9: Yes, I'm aware of that; But  this is something of a low budget system :)
[04:18] <zeeed> oskude: yeap by default maybe, but I change iptables policy
[04:18] <GreyGhost> lafielle ,taht ur 3d card ?
[04:18] <GreyGhost> UniChrome (K8M800) 20060710 ?
[04:18] <phildard> but when i lauch gmd, gdm, can't find my profile
[04:18] <lafielle> GreyGhost: It's supposed to be an S3Trio. I don't know much more than that.
[04:18] <zeeed> oskude: line: iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
[04:19] <zeeed> oskude: should let others to ping me
[04:19] <LjL> minerale: uhm perhaps try "sudo apt-cache gencaches" and/or "sudo apt-get check"
[04:19] <lafielle> lafielle: But I might be wrong.
[04:19] <oskude> zeeed: i never used/needed iptables, so dunno, sorry
[04:19] <zeeed> oskude: ok
[04:19] <zeeed> anyone know iptables?
[04:19] <lafielle> GreyGhost: But I might be wrong.
[04:19] <LjL> !iptables | zeeed
[04:19] <ubotu> zeeed: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:20] <whyameye> I'm a bit confused about user auth and password for NFS...
[04:20] <GreyGhost> lafielle ,hmm.... i'm not really aware of graphic cards myself :( i have onboard ....
[04:20] <minerale>  ljl gencaches seg faults as well, ditto for check
[04:20] <zeeed> ubotu: i have problem with ping, I let thers to ping me using iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT but they still cant ping me
[04:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i have problem with ping, I let thers to ping me using iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT but they still cant ping me - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:20] <lafielle> GreyGhost: Device manager states "S3 Unichrome Pro VGA Adapter". So that looks about right.
[04:20] <spitz> I've got an Intel Core Duo, should I install 32 or 64 bit fglrx driver?
[04:21] <GreyGhost> lafielle ,yep most prolly u do have supprt....
=== xerophyte_ is now known as xerophyte
[04:21] <zeeed> LjL: i have problem with ping, i use iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT in iptables script but I still can't be pinged :( why?
[04:21] <GreyGhost> *but i'm not sure ...
[04:21] <oskude> zeeed: just a guess, do you need that "-i eth0" ? or what ever interface you want...
[04:21] <lafielle> GreyGhost: So, does that look all OK to you
[04:21] <lafielle> ?
[04:21] <GreyGhost> lafielle ,run glxgears ?
[04:21] <LjL> zeeed: you don't happen to be behind a router that blocks pings itself?  also, do you have any *other* iptables rules set?
[04:21] <lafielle> GreyGhost: I don't know what that means, sorry.
[04:21] <GreyGhost> lafielle , i meant run the command glxgears
[04:21] <zeeed> LjL: router may block all pings?
[04:22] <A-L-A-R-M> if i want to isntall the mplayer (hq) i do apt-get install mplayer ?
[04:22] <GreyGhost> lafielle , i myself am pretty new... if i'm not able to help ,... u can always wait around for experienced users... ;)
[04:22] <LjL> zeeed: routers may do many things... what i can tell you for sure is that ubuntu does *not* block pings (or anything, actually) by default, unless you tell it to
[04:22] <Rookie_> before a new rule in iptables can be created you have to flush the rules
[04:22] <zeeed> oskude: i think no, it's general policy, it include all interfaces
[04:22] <Henning> question
[04:22] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: on edgy, yes. on dapper, "apt-cache search mplayer"
[04:23] <zeeed> LjL: i tell ubuntu to pass all pings, but it doesn't listen me :P
[04:23] <lafielle> GreyGhost: It appears to be running. But I got the same warning: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x46
[04:23] <oskude> zeeed: roger... so you got a rule that rejects _all_ connections and you open which you need ?
[04:23] <Henning> how do i change the screen resolution to 1280 by 1024 in the LIVE cd?
[04:23] <lafielle> GreyGhost: No, you've been very helpful, thanks :)
[04:23] <zeeed> oskude: yeap
[04:23] <A-L-A-R-M> LjL:  excuse me, i am a begginer what is edgy and what dapper and how can i know on which one i am ?
[04:23] <foresth> ahoy
[04:23] <LjL> minerale: run an "apt-get update" under gdb - do a "where" after it segfaults - and pastebin the whole output
[04:23] <unimatrix9> lafielle do you know the type of the card?
[04:23] <GreyGhost> lafielle ,its running and its smooth?
[04:23] <orasis> Henning, Preferences screen resolution - but you may not be able to do it - since of course the LIVE CD, is running off deafault.. "Safe" drivers.
[04:23] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: Edgy Eft is Ubuntu 6.10, Dapper Drake is Ubuntu 6.06
[04:23] <orasis> default* even.
[04:23] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: to know which one you're using, lsb_release -a
[04:24] <A-L-A-R-M> i got ubuntu 6.1
[04:24] <zeeed> LjL: i check my router and then I cam to tell what is going on
[04:24] <oskude> zeeed: just cause of paranoia or do you have a reason for that ? but for test, i would remove that rule to see if its ubuntu or your router that rejects ping...
[04:24] <Henning> orasis, is there any....terminal way to change it?
[04:24] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: 6.10, not 6.1 - Ubuntu version numbers are actually dates
[04:24] <zeeed> oskude: ok
[04:24] <frogzoo> A-L-A-R-M: 6.10 10 = october release
[04:24] <zeeed> oskude: i;m going for tests
[04:24] <orasis> Henning, No unless it's actually installed.. you cannot really modify XORG on a read only media..
[04:24] <lafielle> unimatrix9: onboard - VIA chipset (gigabyte). I'm pretty sure that it's an S3.
[04:24] <A-L-A-R-M> ok :)
[04:24] <orasis> Henning You would need to burn your own copy, and basically rewrite the xorg.conf file with the best drivers :)
[04:25] <lafielle> GreyGhost: it's not smooth right now; but that's not surprising as Azureus is running a check on a torrent.
[04:25] <Henning> yeah a linux-savvy friend told me to modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf but I couldn't save it
[04:25] <lafielle> GreyGhost: Which incidentally is taking *ages*
[04:25] <unimatrix9> lafielle do an lspci on the shell ( console )
[04:25] <Henning> but how would i go about it if i actually had it installed?
[04:25] <unimatrix9> and see what it lists
[04:25] <GreyGhost> ahh... k ...
[04:25] <LjL> Henning: you need to be root, to modify that file
[04:25] <whyameye> how do I configure user authentication for NFS?
[04:25] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Henning about root | Henning, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:25] <Henning> okay
[04:25] <orasis> Henning, Well of course not - A cd is read only, and of course the whole "LIVE" part takes place in ram.. so umm yeah.
[04:25] <A-L-A-R-M> LjL:  i get following: E: Couldn't find package mplayer
[04:25] <Henning> i know what root is, though
[04:25] <mulima> frequency sclaing support has gone ... do you know how to reenable / reconfigure it ?
[04:25] <A-L-A-R-M> that means i got to compile it ?
[04:25] <LjL> Henning: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf -- however, depending on what you're trying to do, a "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" might be a better idea
[04:26] <orasis> Henning, After you install PROPER video drivers - you click "system -> preferences -> screen resolution" :)
[04:26] <LjL> !info mplayer edgy | A-L-A-R-M
[04:26] <ubotu> mplayer: The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux. In component multiverse, is extra. Version 2:0.99+1.0pre8-0ubuntu8 (edgy), package size 3461 kB, installed size 8624 kB
[04:26] <stefg> !universe > A-L-A-R-M
[04:26] <oskude> !nfs | whyameye
[04:26] <ubotu> whyameye: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[04:26] <Henning> and where do i get PROPER video drivers for an ATI radeon 9200? :)
[04:26] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: no. if i'm saying it's there, it means it's there, i'm not inventing things without checking ;-)
[04:26] <orasis> LjL He wants to change res on the LIVE cd... while its running live not installed.
[04:26] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: you need to enable universe
[04:26] <orasis> Some video cards do not support that under the safe drivers
[04:26] <lafielle> unimatrix9: http://pastebin.us/10176 is what I see.
[04:26] <unimatrix9> ok
[04:27] <Henning> yeah okay, so i've made my peace with 1024 on LIVE
[04:27] <frogzoo> Henning: well you can get burnt at the stake for recommending proprietary drivers, but fglrx will run that fine
[04:27] <A-L-A-R-M> okie thanks
[04:27] <bluk> hi there; I can't play sound anymore on Ubuntu Drapper Drake, tho the sound seems to be passed to the soundcard (equalizer is moving); and volume is not muted... any help?
[04:27] <LjL> orasis: i think that's possible. the live cd is set up in a way that you *can* modify files (although, of course, they won't survive a reboot)
[04:27] <orasis> Henning You get the fglrx drivers from synaptic :)
[04:27] <mutu310> How do I change my keyboard input language in xubuntu please?
[04:27] <Henning> but if i was to install it, could i get those drivers and they'd work?
[04:27] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: wait, i meant multiverse actually (well, enable both)
[04:27] <Henning> and if not, is there anything that could go wrong with the wrong drivers?
[04:27] <frogzoo> mutu310: sys -> prefs -> keyboard
[04:27] <orasis> LjL, I have tryed before - the xorg simply starts to go nuts on ram and basically dies, might as well do a full install ;)
[04:27] <A-L-A-R-M> to enable it i have to add the url in the repo file ?
[04:28] <A-L-A-R-M> ohh sorry
[04:28] <A-L-A-R-M> there is a help file
[04:28] <orasis> Henning, Well you will have to change drivers thats about it hah
[04:28] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: that is a way, yes. but you may also use Synaptic, or Adept if you're on KDE
[04:28] <A-L-A-R-M> didnt see it
[04:28] <frogzoo> Henning: wrong drivers can cause generla chaos, or just not load
[04:28] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: i usually do it from the command line by editing /etc/apt/sources.list though, yes
[04:28] <Henning> frogzoo: so i'd have to reinstall or anything IF i installed the wrong ones?
[04:28] <A-L-A-R-M> i am on kde, but didnt find anything in there about mplayer either with the package manager
[04:28] <bluk> notice: lspci still shows the soundcard; lsmod stills shows snd_ devices
[04:28] <selinuxium> hi, is it possible to search through a dictionary for words containing a certain seed?
[04:28] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: however you do it, make sure you enable universe and multiverse *not only* in the "edgy" repository, but also in the "edgy-updates" and "edgy-security" repositories
[04:29] <LjL> Ubotu, tell A-L-A-R-M about easysource | A-L-A-R-M, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:29] <orasis> Henning, Naw you'd be sent back to console thats all.
[04:29] <Henning> okay
[04:29] <Henning> so i can install proper drivers from there?
[04:29] <orasis> Henning, If you want to play it safe with minimal problems until you get the feel - just put "radeon" as your driver.
[04:29] <A-L-A-R-M> thank you
[04:29] <whyameye> oskude: yes I've looked that over and user authentication still isn't clear to me.
[04:29] <A-L-A-R-M> i will try to figure out things :)
[04:29] <NeF> hey, if i wanted to play games on a linux box, would it be better to use ubuntu or xubuntu
[04:30] <Henning> where do i put radeon as my driver?
[04:30] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M, even in the package manager (Adept) you still do need to add the relevant components (universe and multiverse)
[04:30] <Stormx2> NeF: It wouldn't matter.
[04:30] <orasis> Henning Open /etc/X11/xorg - find the "device" section, and rather then "ati" -- replace it with "radeon" -- ctrl-alt-backspace, finito.
[04:30] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: if you use that source-o-matic page, it will generate a sources.list for you
[04:30] <lafielle> Q4: The tray icon in Azureus doesn't appear in my launch panel. Is this a configuration issue or a bug
[04:30] <orasis> xorg.conf*
[04:30] <justpaul> !easysource
[04:30] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic.  It does not currently support Edgy sources.  When asked if it will, the reply was "maybe".
[04:30] <Henning> thanks
[04:30] <lafielle> ?
[04:30] <Stormx2> NeF: If your system is low of resources xfce might give you a bit of an advantage
[04:30] <Stormx2> s/on/of
[04:30] <oskude> whyameye: afaik, it uses the user privileges on the host...
[04:30] <A-L-A-R-M> okie
[04:30] <orasis> Fluxbox, will give you an ever bigger advantage :D
[04:31] <NeF> cool, thats Stormx2
[04:31] <NeF> :D
[04:31] <Henning> you know the thing is i wouldn't install it on this particular system because it's a mac, but on another pc that basically consists of on-board stuff
[04:31] <NeF> thanks******
[04:31] <NeF> :P
[04:31] <orasis> Henning, Good luck with the sound :P
[04:31] <Henning> yeah
[04:31] <Henning> installed xubuntu once on that
[04:31] <orasis> Onboard sound + Linux, usually = pain in the rear end.
[04:31] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: err... not sure whether justpaul was just checking, or making a point - but he does bring up a point :-) at any rate, if you decide to use source-o-matic, you can just change every occurrence of "dapper" into "edgy"
[04:31] <Henning> no chance
[04:31] <Stormx2> NeF: remember that not all games run in ubuntu well / at all
[04:31] <whyameye> oskude: I just don't get it. When I mount from the client, how is my authentication checked and how would I set this up?
[04:31] <oskude> whyameye: that means if you mount a nfs with user "foobar", the machine that is serving the nfs has to have a user named "foobar"
[04:31] <Henning> orasis: that's why i deinstalled xubuntu
[04:32] <bluk> my sound disappeared suddently :( even the ubuntu box doesnt play them anymore at login/out
[04:32] <Henning> well, that and the printer
[04:32] <minerale> ljl: how do I give arguments to programs under gdb? - gdb apt-cache search test  -> simply runs apt-cache
[04:32] <NeF> Stormx2 : which linux works the best with games then?
[04:32] <orasis> Henning Naw you can get it working, but you'll probably have to modify your own stuff
[04:32] <oskude> whyameye: it uses the uses name that is logged on (on the machine you want to mount the nfs)
[04:32] <orasis> I had to do the same for my sound because it's onboard..
[04:32] <Stormx2> NeF: They're all about the same. What games are you looking to play?
[04:32] <LjL> minerale: 1) sudo -i  (needs to be run as root)  2) gdb apt-cache  3) run search test  4) where
[04:32] <whyameye> oskude: so you just have to know the name of the user? No password?
[04:32] <orasis> But I did not mind because my onboard sound performs better then my stand alone card anyways :))
[04:32] <Henning> orasis, i would call myself "computer-savvy" but when it comes to linux, i'm a total newbie
[04:32] <Henning> that's where the problem is
[04:32] <NeF> Stormx2 : Savage and warcraft 3
[04:33] <orasis> Henning, Everyone does.. ;D
[04:33] <Henning> okay, but thanks for helping
[04:33] <orasis> yup
[04:33] <LjL> minerale: when you're finished, "exit" to come back from the root login
[04:33] <unimatrix9> lafielle i did take an good look at your card , but there seems to be no driver that i can find for it to help out
[04:33] <Stormx2> NeF: have a look at http://appdb.winehq.org and also their websites. They may run under ubuntu natively or you may need to emulate windows (thats what WINE does)
[04:33] <oskude> whyameye: no, you need the password of that user too (or maybe it even has to be the same on both machines) sorry, didnt start use nfs cause of these, had to go to samba...
[04:33] <bluk> orasis maybe you can help me, i have onboard soundchip too (cmi8738) any chance it happened to you?
[04:33] <orasis> NeF, Warcraft 3 runs PERFECT under Cedega :)
[04:33] <LjL> !warcraft | NeF
[04:33] <ubotu> NeF: Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[04:33] <Stormx2> Henning: What is the issue?
[04:33] <Newbie> where is my /path/to/kernel/source/tree
[04:34] <orasis> Warcraft 3, does not really work nice under wine, only Wine X (Cedega)
[04:34] <minerale> ljl: i'm in the console, can't copy paste at this moment (hold on I need to start up screen) but it's segfaulting in strlen() -> string compare -> debPackagesIndex::findincache()
[04:34] <Henning> Stomrx2, what issue?
[04:34] <LjL> Newbie: unless you installed the kernel source, it's probably not there ;-) what you trying to do?
[04:34] <orasis> bluk I have an ess sound drive, but perhaps its close to the same
[04:34] <Newbie> tv on ubuntu
[04:34] <Newbie> installing a tv card
[04:34] <NeF> ty orasis LjL and Stormx2
[04:34] <KenSentMe> How can i get a list of packages i installed from a certain repository in cli?
[04:34] <orasis> bluk --- xfceubuntu.blogspot.com --- it has some tips for getting on board sound working, give it a shot
[04:35] <bluk> thanks orasis
[04:35] <orasis> bluk OH and remember after the word "options" enter.. new line
[04:35] <LjL> minerale: which still seems like pointing to some problem with that Packages file that you mentioned above from the strace output...
[04:35] <bluk> okay:)
[04:35] <george> I just installed pygame through synaptic but when I run some tuts from the IDLE it says "module not found"
[04:35] <LjL> minerale: i suggest that you take that file, remove it (after backing it up to somewhere else), and try an apt-get update again
[04:35] <orasis> :] 
[04:35] <oskude> whyameye: wait, it sais it uses UID, thats even worse :/ so that means the username you log in in client has to have the same UID on the server :/
[04:35] <LjL> minerale: and *even if* that solves the issue, it'd probably be best to run a memtest (can be done from the boot menu) and a "smartctl -A /dev/yourHD" to make sure there is no hardware problem
[04:36] <unimatrix9> is there an 3D driver for this onboard card VIA Technologies, Inc. S3 Unichrome Pro VGA Adapter
[04:36] <unimatrix9> ?
[04:36] <orasis> unimatrix9 3D accelerated? - no.
[04:36] <unimatrix9> okey
[04:36] <unimatrix9> so bad eh?
[04:36] <whyameye> oskude: this just sound like the root for me. I wish I could get sshfs to work...
[04:36] <orasis> unimatrix9 I do not even think that is 3d "accelerated" under window even.
[04:36] <gizmo_the_great1> frogzoo: not sure if u still there, but in the end I just re-formatted the drive and recopied the data to it, and now it's less the wastebacket junk. Was just taking me too long to do a simple copy backup procedure.
[04:36] <unimatrix9> you might be very right! :P
[04:36] <orasis> It will probably do software 3d though.. that's about it.
[04:36] <orasis> :P
[04:37] <TLE> yuv656: Hey I just saw your twinview question, have you been answered ?
[04:37] <unimatrix9> where can i find the ubuntu tutorails / handbook ( forgot the url )
[04:37] <Jowi> unimatrix9, not sure about the S3 one, but unichrome is supported. I use accelerated 3D with the "via" xorg driver.
[04:37] <Stormx2> unimatrix9: wiki.ubuntu.com
[04:38] <A-L-A-R-M> well in sourc o matic there is no edgy but hoary breezy  dapper. so how to generate the list ?
[04:38] <orasis> Jowi ? O_o
[04:38] <orasis> really?
[04:38] <oskude> whyameye: well, you just have to make sure the user that you use to mount the nfs has the same "User ID" on the client _and_ on the server...
[04:38] <orasis> Push it to the limits huh heh
[04:38] <Jowi> orasis, yeah. got a CLE266 chipset
[04:38] <Stormx2> A-L-A-R-M: Just generate it, then do a find + replace. dapper --> edgy
[04:38] <oskude> whyameye: and, the user has to have rights to read/write that dir, of course...
[04:38] <Jowi> on one of my via mini itx machines
[04:38] <salty-horse> hi do i need special permissions to mark a bug as "confirmed" in launchpad?
[04:38] <Jowi> unimatrix9, check which chipset it uses
[04:39] <A-L-A-R-M> replace u mean to rename the list ?
[04:39] <Jowi> unimatrix9, CLE266 is working with the "via" driver
[04:39] <whyameye> oskude: that sounds so clumsy. What if different people with different computers want to share a disk? I must be misunderstanding...
[04:39] <whyameye> oskude: they all have to log into their own machine first with the same UID?
[04:39] <unimatrix9> i was asking for someone else in here, lafielle
[04:39] <orasis> unimatrix9 If you need to know the chipset.. --- "lspci"
[04:39] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: i told you - in the list you get, replace every "dapper" word with "edgy". you can do a search&replace from your favorite text editor
[04:39] <unimatrix9> VIA Technologies, Inc. S3 Unichrome Pro VGA Adapter
[04:39] <unimatrix9> chipset
[04:40] <oskude> whyameye: yeah, it is "clumsy"... thats why even linux "wizards" are "forced" to use sambe :/
[04:40] <A-L-A-R-M> got it
[04:40] <oskude> whyameye: *samba
[04:40] <orasis> unimatrix9 Ok well anyways to find out if you have 3d direct accel...
[04:40] <KenSentMe> How can i get a list of packages i installed from a certain repository in cli?
[04:40] <orasis> unimatrix9 ... glxinfo | grep render
[04:40] <Renu_> the box of the tvtuner show me to be a palb/g
[04:40] <oskude> whyameye: or you have the same username and uid on the server for every user that wants to use the nfs
[04:40] <orasis> KenSentMe "aptitude"
[04:40] <whyameye> oskude: do you know anything about sshfs? It is not mysteriously working for me. I'm not sure how good a solution it is though.
[04:40] <Renu_> or pal d/k
[04:40] <unimatrix9> ok thnx
[04:41] <fuffe> I need Internet Explorer
[04:41] <oskude> whyameye: never even heard :)
[04:41] <KenSentMe> orasis:  can you give me a lead on what function to use?
[04:41] <orasis> fuffe Why?.. wow
[04:41] <whyameye> !sshfs
[04:41] <ubotu> sshfs: filesystem client based on SSH File Transfer Protocol. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.6-1 (edgy), package size 29 kB, installed size 116 kB
[04:41] <Renu_> what should i choose on source for tvtuner?
[04:41] <orasis> KenSentMe Well it's pretty much self explanatory, "installed" packages etc -- its basically the same as synaptic without graphics
[04:41] <fuffe> orasis, I'm a webmaster, I need to check if my site works with explorer
[04:41] <stefg> fuffe: then either go and buy crossoveroffice, or set up a virtual windows machine in vmware-player
[04:41] <orasis> fuffe So boot up a windows PC.. or ask a friend?
[04:42] <oskude> whyameye: but seems interesting, ill give it a go...
[04:42] <orasis> fuffe .. or Install IE 6.. with WINE
[04:42] <Launchpadd> Does anyone here use VLC player in ubuntu 6.06?
[04:42] <KenSentMe> orasis: but i want a list of packages that come from repository x
[04:42] <stefg> IE6 in wine doesn't really work
[04:42] <A-L-A-R-M> does the list have to be saved somewhere ?
[04:42] <whyameye> oskude: there are a lot of hits on Google with people having trouble with writes. The other thing...I think I read that it actually stores the files locally as well?
=== deadlyallance977 is now known as cjones
[04:42] <orasis> KenSentMe ahh ok ok - not sure how to do that
[04:42] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: err... yes. in /etc/apt/sources.list
=== cjones is now known as jones20992
[04:42] <bluk> orasis: thanks got da sound back :)
[04:42] <orasis> stefg, works fine for me.. except for like active x stuff
[04:42] <orasis> bluk :] 
[04:43] <A-L-A-R-M> okie. thanks
[04:43] <bluk> have a good day :)
[04:43] <unimatrix9> Renu_ input configuration / change video source Television
[04:43] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: as root
[04:43] <minerale> ljl: (sorry I had to reboot) here's the pastebin: http://code.bulix.org/mft40c-26408
[04:43] <A-L-A-R-M> sure
[04:43] <jones20992> what would cause a edgy to freeze when on the live cd ?
[04:43] <oskude> whyameye: which one ? nfs ? samba ? sshfs ?
[04:43] <whyameye> oskude: sshfs.
[04:43] <Launchpadd> jones20992: maybe a scratch on the cd
[04:43] <unimatrix9> jones20992 , bad cdrom, low ram, etc
[04:43] <Launchpadd> cd rom bad, low ram, cd bad
[04:44] <orasis> stefg But of course you need to do some ... tweaking, IE6 does not work on Wine vanilla..
[04:44] <Jowi> unimatrix9, btw, are you using the s3 or the via driver?
[04:44] <frogzoo> jones20992: maybe try disabling acpi
[04:44] <jones20992> unimatrix9 how much ram should i need ?
[04:44] <Launchpadd> frogzoo:  what is acpi?
[04:44] <LjL> minerale: (repeating previous comments, not sure you've seen them - they still apply anyway)
[04:44] <LjL> minerale: which still seems like pointing to some problem with that Packages file that you mentioned above from the strace output...
[04:44] <frogzoo> Launchpadd: acpi = power management
[04:44] <LjL> minerale: i suggest that you take that file, remove it (after backing it up to somewhere else), and try an apt-get update again
[04:44] <jones20992> frogzoo whats the cmd for that ?
[04:44] <LjL> minerale: and *even if* that solves the issue, it'd probably be best to run a memtest (can be done from the boot menu) and a "smartctl -A /dev/yourHD" to make sure there is no hardware problem
[04:44] <A-L-A-R-M> LjL:  just noticed on the allready excisting list file that there are : # deb http://gr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe . so instead of replacing or adding in the file. shouldnt i just remove the "#" ?
[04:44] <unimatrix9> 512 would be fine
[04:45] <jones20992> unimatrix9 i only have 256
[04:45] <unimatrix9> jowi, no i was asking for some one else
[04:45] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: of course, you can do that... source-o-matic is just meant to make that easier
[04:45] <frogzoo> jones20992: you need the boot option 'acpi=off'
[04:45] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: *but* removing the '#' is not quite enough
[04:45] <unimatrix9> jones20992, should be okey but slow
[04:45] <kanedaddy> Hi
[04:45] <aswp`> hi
[04:45] <Jowi> unimatrix9, k k :)
[04:45] <dark-shadow> how do i install jre thru apt-get
[04:45] <dark-shadow> ?
[04:45] <A-L-A-R-M> not enough ? what is more needed /
[04:45] <unimatrix9> jones20992, try boot up and test media
[04:45] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: you also need to 1) enable multiverse (only universe is mentioned there)    2) enable both universe and multiverse also for edgy-updates and edgy-security
[04:45] <dark-shadow> jre (java run env)
[04:45] <Henning> okay, got another question
[04:45] <jones20992> unimatrix9 i did it shows ok
[04:45] <whyameye> from command line how do I find out how much space I am using and have left on my file system?
[04:46] <oskude> whyameye: what error do you get with sshfs ?
[04:46] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: well, mplayer is in multiverse, so enabling universe alone won't quite be very useful
[04:46] <kanedaddy> I'll soon find out
[04:46] <unimatrix9> jones20992, then dont run to many apps at once
[04:46] <frogzoo> whyameye: df -h

[04:46] <A-L-A-R-M> couldnt copy all of them here
[04:46] <LjL> A-L-A-R-M: as for the rest (security and updates), if you don't do it you will 1) not get updates  2) risk that packages in the main component get out of sync with the ones in universe and multiverse

[05:27] <dellorino> who the solution is in winecfg shede libraries???
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> slipttees: with the sudo thing, it's easy to fire things up as root in your user home, then root takes ownership of files
[05:27] <rambo3> Who_, somone knows the right question to list just ask in channel

[05:30] <dellorino> ok i try
[05:32] <Who_> dellorino: also - perhaps try another windows web cam program to see if eyeball or wine is broken :)
[05:32] <Who_> dellorino: good luck :)
[05:32] <Duesentrieb> benjamin: if you have grub active, and delete the partion its on, you can no longer boot. you would need to fix the mbr using a windows install cd or something.
[05:33] <gizmo_the_great1> does any1 here bother with AV software on their Ubuntu machines? And is the primary reason that viruses are not so successful on Linux due to the fact that the root user accounts require manual inputting of the password, unlike Windows where the Admin account is usually open by default?
[05:33] <dellorino> u know another program?
[05:33] <Duesentrieb> benjamin: maybe it would be sufficient to mark the windows partionen as "active" in fdisk.
[05:34] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: it's more involved than that, has to do with how the core of the OS works where in Win, many apps a user runs have core access, linux, not so much
[05:34] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: the av applications for linux are mostly there to filter viruses in email sent through linux to and from Windows clients
[05:34] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: thanks. Do you use AV software yourself on Linux, or is there really no need?
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> I don't use it at all
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> I don't run Windows at all here though
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: if you have Windows users, sending and receiving mail through a linux mail server, it's handy/nice to use the av

[05:38] <zodia1> is it possible to extract RAR with ubuntu?
[05:38] <Kingsqueak> I *think* 'held back' means there are dependencies not yet available, generally when a package is about to be released into the repository
[05:38] <tony22> frogzoo, thanx for the help but read wont hold an "xterm -e" window open, any clues on how to do that?
[05:39] <ubuntuedgy> hi @ all
[05:39] <ubuntuedgy> i need hlp
[05:39] <ubuntuedgy> :D
[05:39] <yuv656> zodia1: http://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-3.6.0.tar.gz
[05:39] <Kingsqueak> tony22: I missed what you are trying to actually accomplish, that might help for a suggestion
[05:39] <ubuntuedgy> i found a thread for diffrent xgl startmethods
[05:39] <ubuntuedgy> a tried some of them
[05:39] <ubuntuedgy> and then
[05:39] <Kingsqueak> tony22: e.g. why do you need to keep an xterm open?
[05:40] <ubuntuedgy> there was one method (changing a symlink so that xgl is standart xserver)
[05:40] <christopherl> installing Activetcl with GUI in root directory while not in terminal, how can get permission to install without using sudo?
[05:40] <tony22> Kingsqueak, running a scrimpt from a file manager, i need to see the results.
[05:40] <ubuntuedgy> i rebooted... xgl wasnt starting
[05:40] <Kingsqueak> tony22: ah, when it runs it's open right, just doesn't stay open?
[05:40] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: no, i have no windows users as such. I have a laptop that has Windows, and I shar a Mozilla Thunderbird profile on a FAT partition between my Linux desktop and my Windows laptop. So perhaps I should install AV just to filter the e-mail, although that said, I have AV software on the Windows laptop anyway?
[05:40] <zodia1> how to use linuxrar?
[05:41] <ubuntuedgy> and i don't know how to enable the old symlink to xserver-xorg
[05:41] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: you only need av on linux if the mail is being sent and received through your own mail server on the linux box, otherwise just use AV on the Windows boxes themselves
[05:41] <tim--> i wouldn't worry about AV, gizmo_the_great1.   viruses are for the other people.
[05:41] <tony22> Kingsqueak, exactly. i tried read - but that doesnt do it. i could try to send output to a file but i would like to see it live too
[05:41] <Kingsqueak> tony22: you would put 'wait' in the script or if a timer is enough   'sleep 30'  for a 30 sec timer
[05:42] <zodia1> how to use linuxrar?
[05:42] <Kingsqueak> tony22: stick either one at the end of the script
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> tony22: iirc 'wait' will require a ctrl-c to close it/stop it
[05:43] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: well it's both really. I can send and receive from either the Windows laptop, or the Linux desktop, using the same Thunderbird profile because it's on a shared FAT partition. So, I could be receiving virus ridden mails on my Linux desktop. But, as we say, in theorythey can't attach the linux box?
[05:43] <tony22> Kingsqueak, thanks, but i need something to wait for an enter... i start the script and often walk away from the computer
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: right, a Win virus won't run on linux basically
[05:43] <benjamin> Duesentrieb: If I want to use the windows cd to do the thing it is just doing it by itself ?
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> tony22: then use 'wait'
[05:44] <tony22> wait just gives me a new line directly
[05:44] <stefg> tony22: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html#toc10
[05:44] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: yep, but this brings us back to the original query about how Linux specific viruses CAN attach Linux. Do I need protection from them? I realise they mostly written for Windows, but I think some are targetted at Linux?
[05:44] <Duesentrieb> benjamin: no. you may have to pick a "repair" option, or use a recovery console, or some such, depending on your version of windows. But i'm not an expert on that. try googleing for "uninstall grub"
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> tony22: yeah was looking it up, you'll need to stick a loop at the end of the script that waits for input before it exits
[05:45] <LinTux> I keep getting this error, any help would be appreciated "E: graphviz-cairo: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 127"
[05:45] <benjamin> Duesentrieb: okay, thanks for helping.
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: there really aren't any, there are trojans, but you would have to run them as root
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: if you don't run your desktop as root, you are pretty safe
[05:46] <tony22> Kingsqueak, stefg thanks! ill try some things.. !!
[05:46] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: ok cool. Obviously I sudo when necessary, but I assume you only mean logging in as root?
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: yes, don't ever run generally applications or an X session as root
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: as in a web browser, an IRC client etc., shouldn't run them as root
[05:46] <LinTux> Can anyone help me clear this error "E: graphviz-cairo: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 127"
[05:46] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: thanks very much. OK, I will not bother with any AV then. That simplifies things a bit :-)
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: it's one of the nicest things about linux
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: switched the wife and kid over a while back, no more constant issues with viruses and spyware

[05:47] <faust_> Anyone here got a good grip on power management and laptops under Linux? I've disabled the screensaver and set the power management to never do anything as long as I'm running on AC, but the screen still goes blank after about ten minutes. Seriously annoying when watching a movie etc.
[05:48] <dellorino> Who_,
[05:48] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: I keep thinking about doing the same thing, but I am still quite new to Linux (using it for everday life for about a year now) and not really confident enough to be able to resolve everything. Sometimes it's just easier to use Windows for certain things.
[05:48] <dellorino> i install wengo
[05:48] <Who_> dellorino: cool
[05:48] <Kingsqueak> faust_: you could disable it in the BIOS if you want

[05:48] <Duesentrieb> faust_: i vaguely remember something about a kernel or driver bug that causes that. also some propriatary option you need to set in xorg.conf or something, for some cards.
[05:48] <stefg> faust_: there might be a bios setting for the screen-blanking time
[05:48] <gizmo_the_great1> Kingsqueak: but as the wife really only surfs the net and access e-mail, I guess I could

[05:49] <stefg> LinTux: what soes 'sudo apt-get -f install' yield?
[05:50] <knapp_> How can I extract an ISO file or open it (without burning it to a CD-R)?
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> gizmo_the_great1: I haven't had to use it for work since 2000 and have used it full time at home since '95 so I'm terrible with Win now
[05:50] <faust_> Yeah, I considered the bios thing, but it doesn't happen in Windows, so I'm thinking there must be some way in firmware or software.
[05:50] <Duesentrieb> knapp_: mountiso

[06:01] <Kingsqueak> |markie|: whatever I can do to talk you out of mapping users to local accounts...  I would advise that as much as possible
[06:02] <|markie|> Kingsqueak: so vir users means using a db
[06:02] <LinTux> how do I scan with Aegis antivirus
[06:02] <Kingsqueak> |markie|: could just mean a text file as a db, but yeah

[06:02] <Kingsqueak> |markie|: keep in mind ftp is clear text so if the password is sent, the account is exposed
[06:02] <dellorino> Who_, i call number 333 and cam work for the first call and later stop work
[06:03] <Renu_> i cannot canfigure my tvtuner i dont know why
[06:03] <LinTux> can anyone tell me how to scan with Aegis
[06:04] <finalbeta> Renu_, more information required.
[06:04] <Renu_> i installed kdetv and tvtime

[06:05] <Hoag> Can anyone recommend a good gdesklets archive? Can't seem to find any. Looking for a good RSS feed grabber in particular..
[06:05] <finalbeta> first time TVtime starts, it should ask you for location info. East europe, pal secam etc. You probably still need to scan in tvtime and kdetv, xawtv just add all standard channels.
[06:05] <jevangelo> i want my company to stop using a windows environment and start using open office, and evolution

[06:14] <finalbeta> Renu_, I doubt that. if you really did enable all repositories, run sude apt-get update first. Perhaps it didn't show up yet
[06:14] <nolimitsoya> paitart, no idea :) have you tried the generic kernel?
[06:14] <max1> nolimitsoya:  that doesn't work i've got 4 partitions i only on the third one it can find a shell but apt-get doens't work

[06:17] <Jesse> ok
[06:17] <owh> Jesse: Dapper has long term support, edgy does not.

[06:17] <paitart> "
[06:17] <owh> Jesse: Edge is the latest version of Ubuntu to be released.

[06:17] <nolimitsoya> paitart, ok, then there is no metapackage... just search and install
[06:17] <Desert88> k i will just stick with dapper if theres nothing important on edgy
[06:17] <Fleebailey33> so then i installed ubuntu and it wouldnt boot
[06:17] <mio> help for wineeeeeeee
[06:18] <Fleebailey33> i think it was becuase it couldnt check the windows file system
[06:18] <nolimitsoya> Desert88, of course there are important new stuff in edgy
[06:18] <Desert88> for a home user?
[06:18] <owh> Jesse: There is generally a new release every six months, Dapper was released in 2006, February, or 6.2, Edgy was released in 2006, October, or 6.10.
[06:18] <Desert88> like what?
[06:18] <stefg> paitart: sudo aptitude install linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
[06:18] <Jesse> Freebaily:> what do you mean it won't boot
[06:18] <nolimitsoya> Desert88, havent i awnsered all that already?
[06:18] <minimec> Hi. My nm-applet is not showing me any wlan-connections. wifi-radar shows them without problems. I configured nm-applet by # eth0 + 1 in /etc/network/interfaces ...
[06:18] <owh> Jesse: Does that help you?
[06:18] <Fleebailey33> so what i need to do is install fresh. and get fat32 and windows filesytem support becuase it was checking that
[06:18] <Jesse> owh:>thnak
[06:18] <Jesse> owh:>thanks
[06:18] <nette> anyone using Beryl??
[06:18] <Jesse> yeh
[06:18] <Fleebailey33> it stopped at checking filesystem
[06:18] <minimec> I am on edgy
[06:18] <Desert88> not really but its ok dapper is fine
[06:19] <nolimitsoya> Fleebailey33, edit your fstab to never check your windows filesystn
[06:19] <nolimitsoya> *em
[06:19] <Jesse> Freebaily:> that's werid your windows parition might have a error on it
[06:19] <Fleebailey33> but i couldnt if it never booted before
[06:19] <nolimitsoya> Fleebailey33, change the last char on the line from 1/2 to 0
[06:19] <ValMarko> I wonder if someone has tv streaming and flash animations not only installed but working with firefox. I wonder how you did it ?
[06:19] <owh> Anyone had any experience where eth0 does not come up after a resume from sleep?
[06:19] <wasp_ems> can someone tell me what the difference betwenn dvd + and dvd- is?
[06:19] <owh> That is, I can manually bring it up, but no automagically.
[06:19] <nolimitsoya> Fleebailey33, boot the live cd, mount / and edit the fstab from there
[06:19] <paitart> stefg: tnx
[06:20] <owh> stefg: How do you get fried fat drives? Are you talking about the names, corruption, or something else?
[06:20] <ata_> I'm having the WPA blues. as long as I connect to a unencrypted network all is fine. when I try to connect to a protected network my wifi-led starts blinking like crazy and I can't connect to anything
[06:20] <Fleebailey33> to cook them
[06:20] <Fleebailey33> thanks nolimitsoya

[06:21] <nolimitsoya> wasp_ems, they are slightly diffrent when it comes to compatibility and editing - and incompatible. check wikipedia for the indepth explaination
[06:21] <wasp_ems> ok thanx
[06:21] <Jesse> ata_:> can't help you their, means wi-fi
[06:21] <Jesse> ata_:> can't help you their, mines wi-fi
[06:21] <Jesse> sprru
[06:21] <Jesse> sorry
[06:21] <Jesse> crap
[06:21] <ata_> :D
[06:21] <ata_> you get an A for trying at least :)
[06:22] <Jesse> lol
=== ata_ is now known as andres
[06:22] <stefg> owh: dosfsck during boot in edgy/dapper and windows chkdsk can't obviously not agree on what a fat32 filesystem is... so if don't change the default behaviour of fsck'ing the fat drives at boot, dosfsck corrupt the drives
[06:22] <Jesse> does anyone know how to make dosemu work?
[06:23] <Jesse> i can't and i have loads of QuickBASIC programs i need to move to gambas
[06:23] <owh> stefg: Could it be that fcsk, or dosfsck are checking your drive as fat16, rather than fat32, and could this be caused by an fstab entry where you've marked the drive as fat, rather than vfat?
[06:23] <Jesse> i thought that vfat was only for swap only
[06:24] <Stormx2> Anyone know C++? I'm completely new and I'd like to know the standard procedures for compiling in ubuntu
[06:24] <owh> Jesse: No, swap has a different type altogether.
[06:24] <narvik86> Jesse: maybe try dosbox?
[06:24] <stefg> owh, i don't care /what/ dosfsck does wrong... i just mark all fat-drives as 0 0 in /etc/fstab
[06:24] <benjamin> I have a problem with my screen resolution. I have a 16:10 flatscreen and in the resolution menu there isn't any resolutions supporting that?
[06:24] <andres> i've looked a little on captive (ntfs under fuse). any hints on how to get it to run in ubuntu?
=== HP_Administrator is now known as tirus89
[06:24] <tirus89> hello?
[06:25] <andres> hello tirus
[06:25] <owh> Jesse: It's a type 82 partition.
[06:25] <jamesbrose> andres, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[06:25] <jamesbrose> andres, go through it until you reach screen resolutuion, select the ones you want with the space bar
[06:25] <jamesbrose> the restart X
[06:25] <andres> jamesbrose: will that help me get a writeable ntfs partition you think? :)
[06:26] <benjamin> someone who can help me?
[06:26] <andres> I think you're talking to benjamin
[06:26] <jamesbrose> andres, no, you need that ntfs thing
[06:26] <jamesbrose> andres, will find the link one min
[06:26] <Jesse> i know
[06:26] <andres> captive you mean?
[06:26] <jamesbrose> andres, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009
[06:26] <owh> stefg: My point is that the fstab might be tripping you up, causing the fsck on boot to run with the wrong options, thus "corrupting" your partition, rather than the right thing, so perhaps you should have a look. I'd be surprised if dosfsck is actually doing something wrong.
[06:26] <andres> great
[06:26] <jamesbrose> oh right
[06:26] <jamesbrose> wrong person :S
[06:26] <Jesse> ok i'll try dosbox

[06:29] <owh> stefg: That sounds wrong to me. I'm not doubting your report, but fat has been around for a looooong time and was from memory the first file system used under linux (I might be mistaken), so the behaviour you're describing just sounds completely wrong.
[06:30] <tirus89> can someone help me with some basic info

[06:39] <nette> hello again: can someone with a radeon card please tell me how to install the default drivers for it? i've tried to install from ati page but it wont work
[06:39] <nette> just the default ubuntu drivers
[06:39] <stefg> owh: The reason is probably that I always do a /server/-install and then dpkg --set-selections... there might be a different default for server and desktop-installs
[06:39] <owh> stefg: And looking at the duplicate bugs, the cause is exactly what I suspected, a fat32 partition being treated as fat16.
[06:39] <owh> stefg: Heh :-)
[06:40] <Okt> finalbeta: Thanks, I've been looking on google/forums since 11 last night... But hey I'll keep looking.
[06:40] <owh> stefg: I'm going to have a little chat in #ubuntu-bugs about this.
[06:40] <james296> can someone PLZ help me add a program to run at systen startup? I go to the sessions application and startup programs and add it, but when I close it and open it again, its automatically not there now
[06:40] <james296> how can I fix this?
[06:41] <finalbeta> nette, the default drivers are the opensource ones, you can't find them on the ATI website. if you want to default ones back. I sugest renning sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, it will set your box back to default.
[06:41] <james296> its called glipper
[06:41] <finalbeta> Follow the steps.
[06:41] <stefg> owh, i'll join in, but will be eating :-)

[06:42] <nette> finalbeta, will it just set the video card to default? or also the keyboard, mice etc.. ?
[06:42] <finalbeta> nette, yep, also the keybord + mouse
[06:42] <nette> finalbeta, ok.. haven't done anything with them so..
[06:43] <finalbeta> unless you made spacial changes, that really shouldn't be an issue.

[06:46] <finalbeta> minerale,I can't give you a perfect solution, and perhaps the issue is no more. But I happen to have ran the live CD on a system with a 9600 card 2 hours ago. After booting I had distorted image due to a to high frequency for the monitor. When I ran  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, it didn't auto recognize the card. So I had to manually select ATI. After that the xserver didn't start. If you select Vesa in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, t
[06:46] <finalbeta> he xserver will start again.
[06:46] <finalbeta> I ran 6.06

[06:49] <darks> apt-get install mysql

[06:49] <bcm43xx-fwcutter> yes ubotu, I'm currently trying to figure out which file i need to download from http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4547

[06:50] <kohr_> so far i have been using ls |grep
[06:50] <kohr_> but that doesn't tell the directory
[06:50] <christiane> bcm43xx-fwcutter: Which chip?
[06:50] <renhoek> anyone know the format of the harddrive i should have before installing ubuntu? ext2, ext3, fat32?
[06:51] <kohr_> renhoek use riserFS
[06:51] <EdLin> renhoek: the installer takes care of that
[06:51] <finalbeta> renhoek, use ext3
[06:51] <theilliniguy> How can I play WMV files?  VLC 8.4 only plays audio...
[06:51] <EdLin> renhoek: personally I'd pick ext3
[06:51] <FirstStrike> theilliniguy: get mplayer
[06:51] <kohr_> renhoek they all work, reiserFS was personally recommended to me

[06:52] <darks> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37601/
[06:52] <theilliniguy> Firststrike thanks - VLc doesnt support WMV files I take it
[06:52] <renhoek> riserFS?
[06:52] <kohr_> get the w32 codexs
[06:52] <renhoek> what is that?
[06:52] <EdLin> Ricerfs is the filesystem that is very fast but doesn't last very long. ;-)
[06:52] <FirstStrike> bcm43xx-fwcutter: ubotu is a bot
[06:52] <theilliniguy> kohr - w32 codecs for VLC?
[06:52] <renhoek> my installer just lockes up evertime i try to manually partition
[06:52] <kohr_> Edlin what do you mean doesn;t last long?
[06:52] <darks> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37601/
[06:52] <finalbeta> there is no reason to push something non standard onto a user like reiser, most distro's using reiserFS are going back to ext3 anyway.
[06:52] <EdLin> kohr_: it loses data
[06:53] <bcm43xx-fwcutter> Well
[06:53] <kohr_> theilliniguy, no for mplayer sorry,
[06:53] <FirstStrike> mm
[06:53] <FirstStrike> what's the trigger..

[06:54] <Okt> Gnome is now giving me errors about "cannot open display" any idea what I can do to resolve this?
[06:54] <renhoek> right now i am running fedora...and gparted doesnt recognize my harddrive formating for one of my drives...is this the problem
[06:54] <kohr_> EdLin Darn it, is it really that bad?
[06:54] <EdLin> kohr_: well, it works for a while, then it hicups. At least, that was my experience with it.
[06:54] <kohr_> EdLin what happened when it hiccuped? you lost data?
[06:54] <finalbeta> kohr_, it also doesn't seem to have much of a future. And ext does.
[06:54] <bcm43xx-fwcutter> I'm having trouble finding out which fwcutter file i need to download from  I'm currently trying to figure out which file i need to download from http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4547 in order to swap it from this computer to my wireless remote computer
[06:55] <EdLin> renhoek: just delete all your Linux partitions if you can.
[06:55] <justsee> Hi I'm doing a manual partition of Ubuntu - and googling hasn't helped: 90 GB available: thinking / - 10GB, /swap - 1.5GB (got 768 MB RAM), /usr/ 5 GB, /var/ 5 GB, /boot/ - 250MB, /tmp/ - 2GB, /home/- the rest - is this sensible or just silly?!
[06:55] <EdLin> kohr_: precisely
[06:55] <kohr_> finalbeta, yeah with its founder being arrested for murdur
[06:55] <renhoek> shouldnt the ubuntu just recognize them anyways?
[06:55] <EdLin> renhoek: Red Hat and Fedora label the partitions, making it difficult to share them.
[06:56] <renhoek> is that why ubuntu locks up everytime i want to manually edit the partitions before install?
[06:56] <finalbeta> kohr_, even before that. I think it was opensuse or mandrake that where the latest to return back to ext3, since ext4 will pretty much be the update of choice.
=== benoit is now known as adam0509
[06:56] <EdLin> renhoek: it could - I don't have experience with gparted and Fedora
[06:56] <kohr_> finalbeta is there a way to switch now? or is it too late?
[06:57] <EdLin> renhoek: I did have problems installing another distro even after shrinking the parititions of RH with Partition Magic, due to the labels.
[06:57] <renhoek> i just don't want to format my fedora off, if that isnt the problem and i am left with no os
[06:57] <bcm43xx-fwcutter> so no1 in here can help me with my wireless problem?
[06:57] <finalbeta> kohr_, no idea, never really did touch reicerFS
[06:57] <renhoek> ahh
[06:58] <kohr_> fwcutter what was it again?
[06:58] <kohr_> finabeta oh darn
[06:58] <renhoek> but i should be able to format in the livecd gparted, before installing?
[06:59] <christiane> bcm43xx-fwcutter: Which chip?
[06:59] <EdLin> renhoek: maybe you should try the alternate install iso
[06:59] <finalbeta> kohr_, http://bozziesfw.wordpress.com/2006/12/11/convert-home-from-reiserfs-to-ext3/ (seems it was openSuse that switched :) ) , one tip though. BACKUP!
[06:59] <kohr_> finalbeta do you think i should switch? is it really worth it right now?

[07:02] <finalbeta> Jesse, what are you looking for SDL can mean a number of things.

[07:12] <A-L-A-R-M> i tried to install some codecs to play avi files that use the xvid codec, by following the instructions of: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats and  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75278&highlight=wmv+codecs   , did create the /usr/lib/win32 directory, added the codecs from mplayer(hq) in there, also changed the settings of different media players to look for the codecs at this directory. but when i try to open the f
[07:12] <james296> the problem CANT be because of automatix2 can it??
[07:13] <jrib> james296: run this command:   find ~ ! -user $USER
[07:13] <Rug> mikebot: did you try sudo pppeoconf ?
[07:13] <snook353> anyone know, one more time
[07:13] <snook353>  Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID b56a8bac
[07:13] <mikebot> Rug: Yes, and it found eth0, but it gave me the following error...
[07:13] <finalbeta> theilliniguy, paste the command correctly, if sudo is not found, your system would be severely broken. "sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20061022-0.0_i386.deb"
[07:13] <emilia> hey guys, i tried using wine to use dvdshrink, but that and k9copy both crash like half way through, k9copy says makeisoof crashed, anyone know if theres anything else i could use?
[07:13] <EdLin> mikebot: I have dhcp, which is automatically configured - if you use pppoe, you need to use pppoeconf.
[07:13] <ValMarko> Is it safe to use automatix?
[07:13] <nolimitsoya> automatix | ValMarko
[07:13] <Rug> james296: I have never had a problem with Automatix2, but others in this channel say that it is bjorked
[07:13] <LjL> ValMarko: NO
[07:13] <nolimitsoya> !automatix | ValMarko
[07:13] <ubotu> ValMarko: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:13] <mikebot> Rug: 'Sorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access Controller of your provider did not respond...'
[07:14] <james296> lol
[07:14] <james296> damnit
[07:14] <mikebot> EdLin: Tried that, but got the above error.
[07:14] <james296> I need to quit usin it then lol
[07:14] <james296> I did that command now what?
[07:14] <finalbeta> Automatix is the script that got blamed for the bad dapper to edgy updates. Apparently it even broke updates on systems where it was never used ;)
[07:14] <EdLin> mikebot: I'm sorry, I've never configured pppoe in Ubuntu since my DSL modem takes care of it.
[07:14] <Rug> mikebot: pppoeconf has always been bullet-proof for me.  I'd check your cables, NIC, modem, etc...
[07:14] <theilliniguy> finalbeta closer - got an unpacking and setting up messages
[07:14] <hydrogen> Does the resizer take a while to run in the installer on fat32 partitions?
[07:15] <hydrogen> or if its just resizing forever is that indicitave of something going wrong
[07:15] <hydrogen> forever being ~15 minutes so far
[07:15] <mikebot> Rug: everything else is connected properly. (I can boot into windows and connect without problems.)
[07:15] <finalbeta> theilliniguy, then it's installed
[07:15] <james296> hey, if I uninstall Automatix 2 think that would solve my problem?
[07:15] <nolimitsoya> hydrogen, resizing is dangerous. yours has likely failed
[07:15] <theilliniguy> finalbeta - got it!  video works - thanks all!!
[07:15] <Rug> mikebot: is it using USB or a NIC?
[07:15] <LjL> i don't think so
[07:15] <mikebot> Rug: I don't know what that means.
[07:15] <CoderX> can anyone help me Gparted can't resize my NTFS partitions anymore.
[07:15] <finalbeta> hydrogen, resizing can take ages. it needs to move all data up or down.
[07:15] <jrib> james296: no probably not
[07:16] <jrib> james296: you don't even know if it was automatix yet
[07:16] <hydrogen> finalbeta, thank you
[07:16] <james296> so, what can I do then? let me guess, the best option would be to once again reformat...correct?
[07:16] <Rug> mikebot: is the DSl modem connected to your computer via a USB cable/interface, or a network cable/interface?
[07:16] <jrib> james296: no, run my command please
[07:16] <linkbelt238> Can someone help me with the live CD?
[07:16] <james296> well how can I figure that out?
[07:16] <james296> I did

[07:18] <linkbelt238> does anyone know the root password for the live cd?
[07:18] <james296> ok, so what do I do now?
[07:18] <PriceChild> tim167: bit it works ;)
[07:18] <tim167> nolimitsoya: its not a bug, its a 'feature' :p

[07:20] <TehBigToe> guys I have 2 updates but when I click on the Update Manager their size is shown as 0, and when I click Install they come up with a "missing Filename: field" error
[07:20] <PriceChild> CoderX: no problemo
[07:20] <Ratarf> hi
[07:20] <TehBigToe> guys I have 2 updates but when I click on the Update Manager their size is shown as 0, and when I click Install they come up with a "missing Filename: field" error
[07:20] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: click "check" first please... see what that does
[07:20] <nolimitsoya> LjL, seems pretty much random. as i said, adept is extremely flaky, and rarely starts up on the first try. with other qt apps its like tossing a dice. firefox, mozilla and the like work perfectly well though, as do all gtk based apps
[07:20] <TehBigToe> ok PriceChild
[07:20] <linkbelt238> both?
[07:20] <Ratarf> I just compiled a lib... But how do I install it?
[07:20] <mikebot> Rug: EdLin: It got past that part of it when I unplugged/plugged back in the eternet cable
[07:21] <james296> now what?
[07:21] <mikebot> I'm going to try to continue with the prompt...thanks for your help
[07:21] <wasabi_> Ratarf: Where do you want to install it?
[07:21] <Rug> mikebot: good luck
[07:21] <jrib> james296: now try to add stuff to startup
[07:21] <nolimitsoya> LjL, this is the one thing (counting out messy menues) that keeps me from going with kde...
[07:21] <Stormx2> What should I use for compiling C++ in ubuntu? cc? gcc?
[07:21] <EdLin> mikebot: when all else fails, check the cables. :-)
[07:21] <LjL> nolimitsoya: "adept" as in "Add/Remove Applications" is extremely crash here. Adept "proper" didn't seem to crash when i used it, but then i use it very rarely. other apps, well, there's KOffice that is a crash party... but that's not even included by default
[07:21] <wasabi_> Stormx2: g++
[07:21] <Rug> EdLin: somedays you just wanna cry.  =)
[07:21] <james296> YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[07:21] <Ratarf> I just want to be able to use it because it's required for installing another application
[07:21] <Stormx2> wasabi_: How do I use it?
[07:21] <james296> IT WORKED!!!!
[07:21] <wasabi_> Stormx2: man g++
[07:21] <EdLin> Stormx2: still compiling something in the universe repository?
[07:22] <Stormx2> james296, easy baby
[07:22] <james296> THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!
[07:22] <jrib> james296: of course :)  don't run programs with sudo unless you need to
[07:22] <LjL> nolimitsoya: messy menus you mean messy control panel / various settings?
[07:22] <LjL> thank him in lowercase please :)
[07:22] <LjL> and when you do, use gksudo if they're GUI programs
[07:22] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, it's got stuck
[07:22] <james296> yeah I know man
[07:22] <TehBigToe> downloading file 25/35
[07:22] <timtrimble> how do I make it so that my s-video port mirrors waht's on the main screen?
[07:22] <EdLin> Rug: setting up DSL was difficult for me too, because Verizon's activation page was IE+Windows only.
[07:22] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: please explain...
[07:22] <wasabi_> Ratarf: What other app? I'm trying to help you decide where you need to put it, which is sort of not written down in stone.
[07:22] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: wait :)
[07:22] <Rug> I have just installed dapper on a dual-cpu/dual-core Opteron Tyan system.  Should I use "linux-image-2.6.15-27-k7" or "linux-image-2.6.15-27-server" for my kernel?
[07:22] <mikebot> EdLin: The question I have now, is it said everythign is fine, but I can't access the interent
[07:22] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: patience :)
[07:22] <mikebot> Does it automatically connect?
[07:22] <EdLin> mikebot: run pon
[07:22] <TehBigToe> and the last 10 or so
[07:22] <wasabi_> rug, depends what you want to do with it
[07:23] <TehBigToe> show "Failed"
[07:23] <wasabi_> rug I believe -k7 is obsoleted.
[07:23] <Rug> wasabi_: I am using Dapper not edgy
[07:23] <wasabi_> Hmm. MIght not be in Dapper.
[07:23] <wasabi_> Yeah. Dunno.
[07:23] <Oliverro> How can I boot on command line with ubuntu 6.10 ?
[07:23] <Rug> Edgy = too bugy for me
[07:23] <wasabi_> -server has more in it than just opteron stuff. It's got modules for clustered file systems and the like.
[07:23] <timtrimble> how do I make it so that my s-video port mirrors what's on the main screen?  I have it set up for them to be two different screens, but I want it to be the same for both.
[07:23] <Rug> wasabi_: this is just a workstation
[07:23] <PriceChild> Rug: then run Dapper
[07:24] <wasabi_> Then just put in -k7
[07:24] <EdLin> I actually had more luck with Edgy, I wish it were the LTS distro.
[07:24] <Rug> wasabi_: ok thanks
[07:24] <wasabi_> PriceChild: welcome to the middle of the conversation
[07:24] <Rug> =)
[07:24] <Ratarf> but thats what the problem is... I compiled libphysfs, so I have a bunch of files, but now I want to install it as if it were installed with the synaptic package manager. I don't know in what folder to put it
[07:24] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, now the Updates window has greyed out and the cursor goes to the Busy one when I hover over it, but there's no dialogs saying what it's doing or anything...
[07:24] <wasabi_> Ratarf: make install DESTDIR=/usr/local, or /opt/whatever
[07:24] <wasabi_> Ratarf: Do not install it in /usr
[07:24] <nolimitsoya> LjL, ive never used the add/remove thing; only the synaptic like interface. its, as i said, extremely flaky. kde is the same on every machine i own, all exept one being athlonxp class processors and the other being a p3. menu layout is terrible, and the amount of clutter with a standard kubuntu/full kde install is amazing. equaly flaky with either kde and kde-core though...
[07:25] <Stormx2> wasabi_: Bleh there aren't any examples? Could you possibly just give me an example line?
[07:25] <christopherl> "After installation, make sure that the directory containing the installed executables (ActiveTcl/bin) is included in your PATH variable." Where can I change the PATH variable so I can run the program?
[07:25] <EdLin> Ratarf: during ./configure use --prefix=/usr/local
[07:25] <aquarius> Is there a master list somewhere of all the binary firmware in the Ubuntu kernel?
[07:25] <Stormx2> wasabi_: Something like "gcc file.cc" would work?
[07:25] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: patience :)
[07:25] <Rug> nolimitsoya: fluxbox as your WM with KDE under the hood makes for one nice system
[07:25] <wasabi_> Stormx2: There are probably hundreds of examples. Hell, every C++ app included with Ubuntu is a potential example. ;)
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> LjL, one thing i realy do love (and hate the lack of in gnome) is the ability to have an xfce/fluxbox like apps menu on rightclicking the desktop. speeds things up a great deal :)
[07:25] <TehBigToe> again?
[07:25] <Stormx2> wasabi_: Bleh
[07:25] <EdLin> Stormx2: is there any particular reason why you're avoiding using the repositories?
[07:26] <nolimitsoya> Rug, how does that work?
[07:26] <Stormx2> wasabi_: I just want to compile a hello world program damnit xD
[07:26] <LjL> nolimitsoya: "synaptic like"? never seen such a thing :-P a lot of people probably wouldn't mind getting that, actually
[07:26] <wasabi_> Stormx2: It can't be more than a two second read of the man page.
[07:26] <Stormx2> EdLin: I'm writing the code.
[07:26] <EdLin> Stormx2: Oh, OK, I must be confusing you with someone else.
[07:26] <Stormx2> wasabi_: The manpage is huge, man ;)
[07:26] <Stormx2> I'll look again tho.
[07:26] <wasabi_> hmm. true.

[07:26] <wasabi_> gcc file.cc -o outname
[07:26] <Rug> nolimitsoya: Fluxbox gives you ZERO clutter.  KDE as the back-end gives you the excellent app compatability
[07:26] <wasabi_> And you need various options to make it ELF i think
[07:26] <emilia> anyone reccomend something to backup dvd movies other than wine and dvdshrink & k9copy ?

[07:26] <Fleebailey33> world
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> LjL, ive never actualy seem anything resembling add/remove programs in kde, but what comes up when doing gksu adept looks pretty much like synaptictome :)
[07:27] <LjL> nolimitsoya: as for the clutter... well, the basic, standard KDE stuff (kdesktop, konqueror etc) is as cluttered as it can get, true. on the other hand, a few "third-party" (or almost) applications imho tend to be *less* cluttered than the GNOME equivalents
[07:27] <Rug> emilia: do you want to rip or copy?
[07:27] <Fleebailey33> emilia, none can do across
[07:27] <LjL> nolimitsoya, err, K / Add/Remove Programs :)

[07:27] <emilia> Rug : rip to iso, preferably compress also, the way dvdshrink does
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> Rug, i got that part, but how does one go about setting that up? or do you mean just using fluxbox as session?
[07:28] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: alt tab to make sure t here's nothing hiding beneath
[07:28] <Rug> emilia: acidRip
[07:28] <Fleebailey33> but lxcopy is good all in one

[07:28] <TehBigToe> no PriceChild, nothing
[07:28] <Rug> nolimitsoya: Fluxbox as the session will do the trick
[07:28] <nolimitsoya> LjL, completely missed it :P and i was giving kubuntu feisty another whirl just last night :/
[07:28] <emilia> aquarius :  k9copy always crashes making the iso
[07:28] <nolimitsoya> Rug, then im with you. i might try that :)
[07:28] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: please be patient then :)
[07:28] <aquarius> emilia: oh. OK. I can see how that would be a problem. Doesn't do that for me. :)
[07:29] <Stormx2> EdLin: I already have build-essential, and I'm pretty sure you need makefiles and stuff for using "make"
[07:29] <emilia> aqaurius : youre probly in kde?
[07:29] <Rug> nolimitsoya: It's my favorite combination.
[07:29] <A-L-A-R-M> under which directory can i find the file which includes the url with the repos ?
[07:29] <LjL> nolimitsoya: also if Konqueror and its menus are too messy for your tastes, there's Dolphin that's a much simpler file manager, much like Nautilus i think
[07:29] <Fleebailey33> i like lxcopy
[07:29] <Rug> right-click "Start-menu" = Heaven
[07:29] <nolimitsoya> LjL, ill check it out. thank you :)
[07:29] <EdLin> Stormx2: most of the time those are automatically created with autoconf making a configure file
[07:29] <LjL> nolimitsoya: also if you base your stability statistics on Feisty, well :-P
[07:30] <Rug> nolimitsoya: check out the gentoo fluxbox screenshots and check-out conky too.
[07:30] <aquarius> emilia: nope, Gnome. When I installed k9copy I assume it pulled in the dependencies it required...
[07:30] <LjL> nolimitsoya: about menus, what i really do like about KDE is mac-style menubar
[07:30] <nolimitsoya> LjL, i was just going to say im not :P this is my experience with kde and kubuntu since dapper :)
[07:30] <LjL> hope that's not going away in KDE 4
[07:30] <PriceChild> A-L-A-R-M: /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:30] <A-L-A-R-M> thanks
[07:31] <PriceChild> A-L-A-R-M: please use the software sources program to edit it though
[07:31] <Rug> If you want to see a HORRIBLE kde menu layout, checkout the newest OpenSuse Live CD.
[07:31] <A-L-A-R-M> okie
[07:31] <defrysk> ah kickoff ?
[07:31] <LjL> Rug: well if you mean "menu" as in "the list of applications etc", at least that's very easily changeable so in the end who cares
[07:32] <Rug> LjL: no, it's so bad its funny.  You gotta see it.
[07:32] <nevron> can somebody help me config my dual heads
[07:32] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, still waiting...
[07:32] <nevron> ?
[07:32] <defrysk> about kickoff : http://tuxicity.wordpress.com/?s=kickoff
[07:32] <Stormx2> my hello world program didn't work XD~~
[07:32] <Stormx2> I suck.
[07:32] <nevron> ?
[07:33] <LjL> Rug: i haven't seen the newest one, i suppose, but the one i've seen looked much like Windows XP - one huge menu (a dialog window, really, wider than high) with just about everything on it

[07:33] <EdLin> Stormx2: gcc -o hello hello.c
[07:33] <Fleebailey33> experiences dual booters here?
[07:33] <Stormx2> EdLin: Thats for C++, correct?
[07:34] <er4z0r> can somebody help me with greasemonkey , tails export and firefox?
[07:34] <EdLin> Stormx2: same flags, but maybe use g++
[07:34] <ValMarko> is it safe to install and use easyubuntu to activate plugins ?
[07:34] <hydrogen> heh
[07:34] <EdLin> Stormx2: make files aren't made by humans anymore, they are made with autoconf
[07:34] <Rug> LjL: what makes it bad, is how you move "forward and Back" between different sub-menus
[07:34] <buckweat420> Whats up all?
[07:34] <hydrogen> what exactly would make a hello world program worthy of using c++
[07:34] <Stormx2> EdLin: Okay
[07:34] <Stormx2> EdLin: Well that didn't work either btw...
[07:35] <A-L-A-R-M> mplayer to be installed it says on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer to install it from multiserv repo.  as much i see in my repo list i have a main restricted universe multiverse . is that the same repo ? (if yes somehow i dont see the mplayer package to install it)
[07:35] <EdLin> Stormx2: what is your command line?
[07:35] <Fleebailey33> i installed windows first on a 30 gig partion becuase i would have to reinstall grub anyway
[07:35] <Stormx2> Basicly it's having trouble with #include <iostream> I think
[07:35] <Fleebailey33> and im waiting for that
[07:35] <LjL> Rug: honestly i rarely use the menu anyway... the applications i use 95% of the time are in the quicklauncher (which is nice enough to guess them for me), and the rest i mostly launch using the terminal, or katapult
[07:36] <longwayoff> When ripping CDs using sound juicer to OGG format is there a varible setting like when ripping mp3s? You know like 128, 192, 256 ect?

[07:36] <Stormx2> EdLin: Any suggestions? I'm not sure what I should be including as for libs (or whatever they are)
[07:37] <EdLin> Stormx2: are you using a namespace? If not, you'll need std::
[07:37] <EdLin> Stormx2: /j ##c++
[07:37] <Stormx2> EdLin: using namespace std;
[07:37] <drcode> hi all

[07:39] <drcode> any idea?
[07:40] <drcode> how I can tell linux to move into nvidia video output?
[07:40] <longwayoff> Rug: Thanks
[07:40] <Okt> How would one use "--purge"
[07:40] <longwayoff> okay now whats better a torrent download or a magnet download?
[07:40] <bruenig> unnutz, it would seem ~/.BitchX would be the place but for whatever reason it doesn't look like it is

[07:41] <nevron> is there anyone using dual head big desktop with ati drivers and has direct rendering enabled?
[07:41] <longwayoff> Rug is there a way to speed torrents up? They seem to be so slow
[07:42] <Rug> longwayoff: make sure your upstream bandwith isn't saturated
[07:42] <Montaro> minerale: im having the same problems..
[07:42] <Montaro> minerale: not all of them, but ive noticed php seg faults, and apache has gone a little crazy

[07:43] <PigDogs> hey all
[07:43] <Montaro> minerale: apt-get dist-upgrade'ed about 1hr or so ago
[07:43] <Rug> ok bye all
[07:43] <PigDogs> can anyone advise about upgrading Ubuntu? What entries have to be hashed out in the repos file?>
[07:43] <Rug> Time for football
[07:43] <nevron> is there anyone using dual head big desktop with ati drivers and has direct rendering enabled??
[07:43] <PigDogs> !upgrade
[07:44] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes

[07:44] <hydrogen> so uhh
[07:44] <teicah> im going to a dude's house with cable internet.. i want to d/l edgy updates and burn to cd; http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/ doesnt seem to have a link to updates.. where can i find them?
[07:44] <hydrogen> what does it mean if the installer freezes?
[07:44] <Montaro> not as of yet. i've since updated apt again, but no repositories have changed yet.. so guess i just have to wait until they fix it
[07:44] <hydrogen> as in hard lock
[07:45] <nevron> is there anyone using dual head big desktop with ati drivers and has direct rendering enabled??
[07:45] <n2diy> why is a .deb package five times smaller than the equivalent tar.gz package?
[07:45] <Montaro> hydrogen: faulty hardware?
[07:45] <hydrogen> Montaro, I don't believe so, it froze at configuring locales
[07:45] <hydrogen> which just seems odd
[07:45] <Montaro> n2diy: because its in the compiled binary form, not plain text source..
[07:45] <hydrogen> it copied everything
[07:45] <PigDogs> can anyone advise the lines that have to be hashed out before doing apt-get update??? PLEASE
[07:45] <hydrogen> I guess what I'm asking is if I do a hard reboot will it need to start over or can it pick up from where it hung at
[07:45] <bruenig> n2diy, it would depend on the application of course. The tar.gz would have to have configure scripts and stuff. So for small applications, that could make it far larger. But for large applications they should be nearly the same
[07:46] <n2diy> Montaro, ok, I'm trying to get Mondo installed here, and the developers want me to install v.2.20.
[07:46] <Montaro> hydrogen: can you alt+f2 or something to get another terminal and see what happened?
[07:47] <Ratarf> I tried compiling the physfs lib with "make install DESTDIR=/usr/local", it showed no errors or such but it still doesn't show up in synaptic package manager

[07:47] <bruenig> what is the alternative name for browser. Is it www-browser
[07:47] <hydrogen> Montaro, nah, its hardlock (no keyboard/mouse input) and sounds like everything stopped running in the laptop
[07:47] <hydrogen> the cddrive isn't doing anything
[07:47] <jrib> bruenig: x-www-browser  may be what you want

[07:49] <wrathchild9> hello
[07:49] <asia> hello
[07:49] <dfcarney> Ratarf: I just tuned in -- what leads you to believe that it will show up in the package manager?  Furthermore, why do you need it to show up there?
[07:49] <nevron> nobody is using ati drivers dual head setup? i dont believe it therer 966 people in the room
[07:50] <wrathchild9> how I can look, what is charset on samba server?
[07:50] <minerale> Does anyone know how to read strace? -- all the apt-* utilities are choking on the newly downloaded package lists -- I delted them, did apt-get update and they choke: heres a strace of apt-cache search test: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~achille/apt-cache-strace.txt
[07:50] <dfcarney> nevron: There may be 966 people, but there's probably only 20-30 actually reading and participating.
[07:50] <amro> I'm getting an error when logging into GNOME on Edgy: something about a message bus error

[07:51] <hydrogen> thats not english.
[07:51] <Ratarf> I have an autopackage installer for a game. It checks for all required libraries and says "libphysfs" is missing. I can install it from the package manager, but it's an older version. So I grabbed the source of this lib and tried to install it
[07:51] <Reisiger> Good evening everyone. I got a little problem starting the graphical interface to manage grub. Under "System"-> "System-Controll" there is no entry for "Boot" and using the "sudo boot -admin" in a terminal window tells me it doesn't find the command... :-/
[07:51] <theCore> wrathchild9: ?
[07:51] <snook353> anyone help me with fetchyahoo?
[07:51] <snook353> Failed: Couldn't open output: >>/var/spool/mail/chemicalkook at /usr/bin/fetchyahoo line 1423, <STDIN> line 3.
[07:51] <Ratarf> and I thought, if the lib was correctly installed, it would show up in the package manager
[07:52] <theCore> I think we can say hello to wrathchild9's cat :)
[07:52] <PriceChild> !anyone > snook353
[07:52] <dfcarney> minerale: is that strace output with the "follow forks" option enabled?

[07:52] <paradox34690> driver assistance... anyone, anyone??
[07:52] <PriceChild> !anyone > paradox34690
[07:52] <amro> anyone know what could be causing a message bus error when logging into GNOME on edgy?
[07:53] <minerale> dfcarney: i simply did `strace apt-cache search test &> output.txt`
[07:53] <PriceChild> amro: what error?
[07:53] <willys_fueguino> Hi!!!
[07:53] <willys_fueguino> how do I install a file .package???
[07:53] <paradox34690> If thats an offer of assistance, i'll take it PriceChild... :)
[07:53] <dfcarney> minerale: use the -FF option (I believe) in the strace call to follow execution into forks
[07:53] <PriceChild> paradox34690: I may not know... just write the question
[07:53] <moonlite> Ratarf: "correctly installed". The package manager has some sort of database or something to keep track of dependencies and what files belong to which package etc etc. "make install" from a source package basically just copies files to the "correct" places on your harddisk. I'd advise you not to install anything but stuff from ubuntus official repos
[07:54] <amro> PriceChild: im attempting to make it show up, sometimes i see a gray box instead of the error box, but i remember something about failing to map a message bus address
[07:54] <dfcarney> minerale: actually, it may just be -f
[07:54] <Desert88> can anyone here help with beryl?
[07:54] <willys_fueguino> how do I install a file .package???
[07:54] <Ratarf> but I need to install this lib to get the game working
[07:54] <dfcarney> minerale: (I had to boot back into Windows, so I can't check at my prompt)
[07:55] <PriceChild> amro: I've not got a clue what's going on :) - probs won't know the answer either. Would be best to know what you're doing
[07:55] <paradox34690> I just installed 6.10 on a tower, it's wireless and using a Linksys Wireless USB adapter... According to Linksys, they don't have any Linux adapters... obviously, I don't want to have to go buy a new adapter, so I'm looking for help in getting what I have to work...
[07:55] <mhb> hi all
[07:55] <candyban> How come ubuntu edgy won't boot if I have /dev/sd (entire disk)? in my md device rather than /dev/sd?x (partition) ?
[07:55] <Ratarf> the game requires version 1.0.1, and in the repositories the most recent version is 1.0.0
[07:55] <minerale> dfcarney: it's -F, hold on while I upload it
[07:55] <PriceChild> mhb: Hi
[07:55] <willys_fueguino> how do I install a file .package???
[07:55] <mhb> if I want to re-autodetect my graphic card (Xorg.conf rewrite), what should I do?
[07:55] <longwayoff> I cant seem to get my torrent download above 2Kb
[07:55] <PriceChild> mhb: sudo dpkg--reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[07:56] <candyban> must be something in initrd because the setup boots fine in dapper ... and in edgy with dapper kernel
[07:56] <minerale> dfcarney: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~achille/strace2.txt
[07:56] <snook353> what does fetchyahoo want? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37610/
[07:56] <errorlevel> If I remove ubuntu-desktop, will all the packages that it pulled in still be installed?  I want to remove gnome-btdownload so that I can remove bittorrent and install the .deb file from bittorrent.com.  I just don't want to make anything harder on myself for when it comes time to upgrade.
[07:56] <mhb> PriceChild: thanks
[07:56] <willys_fueguino> how do I install a file .package???
[07:56] <dfcarney> minerale: ugh -- not much more help there.
[07:56] <PriceChild> errorlevel: no
[07:56] <paradox34690> When I open up the networking application, it shows a wireless adapter, I provide my wireless SSID, and I open up my Networking Tools, it shows up in there, but it's not pulling an IP or anything...
[07:56] <paradox34690> any clues?
[07:57] <PriceChild> errorlevel: ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package... make sure you install it before upgrades to newer versions, e.g. dapper_.edgy
[07:57] <wrathchild9> I have two PC-s, and on server I have smb share, and on another PC I see it normally, but if I mount it, I don't see hungarian characters
[07:57] <errorlevel> PriceChild: Okay.
[07:57] <dfcarney> minerale: have you looked at "var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_main_binary-i386_Packages" ?
[07:57] <dfcarney> minerale: are any filesystem errors reported in 'dmesg'?
[07:57] <willys_fueguino> how do I install a file .package???
[07:58] <minerale> dfcarney: I deleted that file, apt-get update re downloads it and then it chokes on it again
[07:58] <wrathchild9> I set guest,iocharset=utf8,codepage=utf8
[07:58] <Slart> Hello.. can someone recommend a good address book application.. preferably one I can share on my lan... integration with thunderbird is also good
[07:58] <candyban> Did anyone setup ati (proprietary driver) + xgl + beryl successfully? (I have a thinkpad T43p and I followed a howto to the letter, but it didn't work)
[07:58] <wrathchild9> but anything isn't ok
[07:58] <wrathchild9> what?
[07:58] <PriceChild> willys_fueguino: i reccomend  installing with .deb if possible
[07:58] <PriceChild> willys_fueguino: are you sure the software isn't availiable as deb?
[07:58] <minerale> dfcarney: nothing serious on dmesg

[07:59] <amro> PriceChild: I've just installed Ubuntu Edgy on another laptop. It ran fine with LiveCD, but when I login through the installed one all I see is the background image. When logging in Failsafe Gnome, I get a gray box which sometimes fully renders with the error message
[07:59] <willys_fueguino> (its the vdrift package)
[07:59] <PriceChild> willys_fueguino: what is the software?
[07:59] <lufis> I'm trying to compile an app (VLC) that has a lot of dependencies. I'm compiling the dependencies I want (such as libdvdcss, x264, etc.). Do I need to do anything special to compile -dev versions of the dependencies, or is that taken care of automatically?
[07:59] <dfcarney> minerale: I dunno.  I mean, if you've run 'apt-get clean' and you're still getting the crash then I suggest that you escalate it to a developer in #ubuntu-devel
[07:59] <PriceChild> willys_fueguino: vdrift?
[07:59] <willys_fueguino> PriceChild: Vdrift
[07:59] <willys_fueguino> yeap
[08:00] <PriceChild> amro: what error?

[08:00] <kane77> unnutz, heh thanx.. I didnt notice there was such a thing... :D
[08:00] <willys_fueguino> PriceChild: vdrift.net
[08:00] <dfcarney> minerale: simply put, it's a SIGSEGV...which could be due to file/data corruption, disk errors, mismatching libraries (doubtful), etc...
[08:01] <willys_fueguino> PriceChild: Im here: http://vdrift.net/faqman/index.php?op=view&t=5
[08:02] <narvik86> willys_fueguino: its autopackage, execute it in console
[08:02] <amro> PriceChild: It logged into GNOME and I can see the panels now, and I got the error, which says that themes/sounds/etc might not work properly (and they don't) because it could not find the address of the message bus
[08:02] <dfcarney> minerale: have you tried using a different sources.list?  Maybe the downloaded file itself is corrupt and when it's parsed it causes an error.
[08:02] <willys_fueguino> narvik86: ./the/dir/tothepackage???
[08:02] <PriceChild> willys_fueguino: there was a deb availiable :( but listen to narvik86 now
[08:02] <minerale> dfcarney: how would I run a fsck? it tells me it's dangerous to do it on a mounted volume -- should I ignore that error ?
[08:03] <amro> it also suggests a couple of manpages (dbus-launch and dbus-daemon) but i haven't found anything useful in them
[08:03] <willys_fueguino> narvik86: didnt worked
[08:03] <dfcarney> minerale: no, don't ignore it.
[08:03] <dfcarney> !fsck | minerale
[08:03] <ubotu> minerale: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[08:03] <minerale> I'll try that, thanks
[08:03] <PriceChild> armo: run gnome-settings-daemon
[08:03] <dfcarney> minerale: odds are that you don't have filesystem corruption.  I suggest that you start by changing your sources.list file to download everything from a different server, run "apt-get clean", and try again.
[08:04] <narvik86> willys_fueguino: if you didnt install any autopackage's you need to install it from console, http://autopackage.org/docs/howto-install/
[08:04] <willys_fueguino> ah ok
[08:04] <willys_fueguino> thanx a lot narvik86 and PriceChild
[08:05] <willys_fueguino> I'll be back if it doesnt work

[08:11] <aristocrat> hey guys, anyone have an idea of how i can initiatise an rpm db in ubuntu ?
[08:11] <TehBigToe> ok
[08:11] <ompaul> PriceChild, they had left
[08:12] <PriceChild> ompaul: never saw the exit message :(
[08:12] <n2diy> aristocrat:  Alien will translate RPMs to .debs.
[08:12] <PriceChild> !pastebin > TehBigToe

[08:12] <Max-O-Matic> ive set up nfs between my PC(dapper 6.06) and my small laptop(breezy5.04)... i can only mount   with : mount -a      and not with mount -t nfs 192.168.xxx.xxx
[08:12] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[08:12] <Max-O-Matic> andso on
[08:12] <stockfisch> i have possibly found the error...
[08:12] <aristocrat> but there is rpm package available in the repos.
[08:12] <stockfisch> java takes 99% cpu
[08:12] <stockfisch> can anyone tell how this might come?
[08:13] <stockfisch> i mean how i can find out?
[08:13] <aristocrat> i want to create a chrooted rpm filesystem
[08:13] <Max-O-Matic> when i mount with mount -t  it gives back an error:  that reads that i have no privleges
[08:13] <n2diy> aristocrat:  go for it
[08:13] <amro> PriceChild: Well do you think I should reinstall?
[08:13] <kane77> does  6.10 (xubuntu) have something like gparted?
[08:13] <yeager> stockfisch: garbage collection or just a crappy java application perhaps
[08:13] <Max-O-Matic> but with mount -a no problem

[08:13] <angusprune> Hi, On a fresh install of kubuntu 6.10 (just applied updates and installed restricted codecs) I am trying to share a folder over the network.  When I click on 'Configure File Sharing' in folder properties the following dialogue appears http://angusprune.googlepages.com/SharingError.png  If I try running 'Sudo Konqueror' clicking 'Configure File Sharing' it does nothing.  Can anyone help me?
[08:13] <PriceChild> amro: no
[08:14] <PriceChild> amro: i just don't know really
[08:14] <dfcarney> stockfish: azureus is a resource hog.  I'm not surprised if it's using 99% CPU
[08:14] <yeager> stockfisch: azureus is known to use too much cpu. try qbittorrent instead
[08:14] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, whoops
[08:14] <TehBigToe> I pasted it into pastebin before I saw ubotu's message
[08:14] <stockfisch> is it as easy to set up?
[08:14] <TehBigToe> I used pastebin.ca instead
[08:14] <TehBigToe> http://pastebin.ca/282606
[08:14] <dfcarney> stockfish: "nice" the process to lower it's priority so that other (more important) processes can get the CPU time that they need
[08:14] <Okt> I love how if you play with things long enough it all works out in linux. :D
[08:14] <yeager> stockfisch: no, ubuntu package available at www.qbittorrent.org
[08:14] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: no problem
[08:15] <unnutz> [sYn] , something says me that's Rhythmbox
[08:15] <kane77> does  6.10 (xubuntu) have something like gparted?
[08:15] <stockfisch> is qbittorrent coming with a gui?
[08:15] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: please pastebin "cat /etc/apt/sources.list"
[08:15] <TGPO> kane77 sudo apt-get install gparted .... now you have gparted
[08:15] <dfcarney> stockfisch: (sorry, sent this to the wrong name before) --  "nice" the process to lower it's priority so that other (more important) processes can get the CPU time that they need.
[08:15] <cortx> all: hi
[08:16] <PriceChild> hi cortx
[08:16] <yeager> stockfisch: yes, a qt4 gui
[08:16] <kane77> TGPO, I meant if i want to install it to a computer... I need to partition first...
[08:16] <Okt> I eneded up installing KDE, and now I have gnome working again, so how can I get rid of all of the bloat that came with KDE?
[08:16] <stockfisch> ill try it then

[08:16] <stockfisch> i did not have any probs with azureus under suse 10.1
[08:16] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, http://pastebin.ca/282610
[08:16] <TGPO> kane77 you mean installing from the CD .... yes it comes with a partition utility
[08:16] <dfcarney> stockfisch: did you use Gnome under SuSE?
[08:17] <stockfisch> no, i used kde
[08:17] <dfcarney> stockfisch: that could be why.  Gnome also uses a lot of resources.
[08:17] <stockfisch> but i wanted to get to gnome anyways
[08:17] <kane77> TGPO, you know I want to get my dad use it on his computer... (and I dont want to mess things up...)
[08:17] <stockfisch> hmm
[08:17] <Max-O-Matic>  ive set up nfs between my PC(dapper 6.06) and my small laptop(breezy5.04)... i can only mount   with : mount -a      and not with mount -t nfs 192.168.xxx.xxx:/    /
[08:17] <stockfisch> i have heard the same about kde
[08:17] <yeager> dfcarney: that is not completely correct. gnome uses not much more resources than kde
[08:18] <stockfisch> thats why i changed to gnome
[08:18] <dfcarney> stockfisch: yeager's suggestion to switch to another application may help
[08:18] <hydrogen> gnomes just uglier
[08:18] <TGPO> kane77: dont take this the wrong way, but if your afraid of breaking other people's stuff then odds are you probably shouldnt be doing it in the first place
[08:18] <dfcarney> yeager: in my experience, KDE uses sufficiently less than Gnome to make a noticeable performance impact
[08:18] <stockfisch> well, if firefox would start within the next ten minutes id have a look :-(
[08:18] <kane77> hydrogen, point of view...
[08:19] <kane77> hydrogen, I like it very much
[08:19] <hydrogen> kane77, point of view... gospel truth... there isn't much difference
[08:19] <bytecolor> how do I keep ubuntu from wanting to update my kernel?
[08:19] <dfcarney> stockfisch: can you get to a command prompt?  If so, type "top"  -- what's eating up all of your resources?
[08:19] <stockfisch> i already did
[08:19] <stockfisch> its the java packet
[08:19] <TGPO> hydrogen: Gnome and KDE ugly as hell and resource hogs to boot, the ugly part atleast I admit is preferanse
[08:20] <bytecolor> something in apt-conf?
[08:20] <dfcarney> stockfisch: have you tried nice'ing it?
[08:20] <stockfisch> i will not
[08:20] <MUTU> Hi, I'm installing Ubuntu 64-bit from the LiveDVD. I want Grub to be installed on my SATA hard disk (/dev/sda). By default it will install it at "(hd0)". What do I need to change it to, to install Grub on by SATA hard disk pls?
[08:20] <dfcarney> stockfisch: why not?  i'm curious.
[08:20] <stockfisch> i dont think this would help
[08:20] <angusprune> Since no one seems able to help with my previous question, Can anyone please tell me how to share a folder in kubuntu 6.10 with another networked kubuntu 6.10 machine?
[08:20] <bytecolor> er apt.conf I mean
[08:20] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, firefox -remote "openurl(%s,new-tab)"
[08:20] <TehBigToe> er
[08:20] <TehBigToe> wrong paste :P
[08:20] <dfcarney> stockfisch: well, it's your call.
[08:20] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, http://pastebin.ca/282610
[08:20] <TGPO> MUTU /dev/sda IS a sata disk
[08:21] <tschentz> @<angusprune> have you tried nfs?
[08:21] <FirstStrike> !samba
[08:21] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[08:21] <stockfisch> dfcarney: sorry for that... this is just because i believe that it would speed up other applications, but it wont help for the seeding problem with azureus itself
[08:21] <livingtm> i am having a serious problem with nautilus. Ever since an update about a week ago, nautilus hangs while browsing from folder to folder. makes my machine totally useless.
[08:21] <MUTU> TGPO: I know. What do I need to change (hd0) to?
[08:21] <kane77> TGPO, I installed ubuntu several times and never had no trouble... (well apart from one time when I already had lilo in MBR and ubuntu somewhat ignored the fact...)
[08:21] <livingtm> nautilus has to be "force-quit"
[08:21] <dfcarney> stockfisch: i understand.  what are your system specs?  how much RAM/swap do you have?
[08:22] <angusprune> tshentz: All i've tried is the following, which is where I came in Hi, On a fresh install of kubuntu 6.10 (just applied updates and installed restricted codecs) I am trying to share a folder over the network.

[08:23] <yeager> [sYn] : that media player looks like last-exit
[08:23] <stockfisch> that should be enough for torrent i believe
[08:23] <dfcarney> stockfisch: and you're having performance issues?  That's crazy. :P
[08:23] <tschentz> @angusprune ok, then: apt-get install nfs-user-server  on both machines
[08:23] <stockfisch> thats really weird, true
[08:23] <dfcarney> stockfisch: 'dmesg' doesn't report anything out-of-the-ordinary?
[08:24] <yeager> stockfisch: well, try qbittorrent, it's qt4 (kde) and easy to use
[08:24] <TGPO> kane77 then what are you asking? you know what your doing and have done it several times ??? your not making much sense
[08:24] <hydrogen> MUTU, do you have multiple harddrives on your computer?
[08:24] <stockfisch> i just killed java and i am looking up the prog on the page you have given to me
[08:24] <Max-O-Matic> !nfs
[08:24] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[08:24] <MUTU> hydrogen: yes, 3
[08:24] <MUTU> 1 SATA, 2 IDE
[08:25] <MUTU> trying to install Ubuntu on the IDE slave
[08:25] <tschentz> on the "server"edit the /etc/exports file and write something link this: /home/tschentz/ 192.168.101.101  in one line, where /home/tschentz is the directory you want to share and the IP address is the adress of the machine which is allow to connect to this share
[08:25] <amro> PriceChild: Reinstalling the dbus package fixed it. I suspect a bad CD
[08:25] <stockfisch> MUTU: I have ahd the same problems
[08:26] <TGPO> MUTU grub has to be on the MBR of the "active" HD or on a floppy
[08:26] <stockfisch> grub had to be installed on the first boot disk
[08:26] <MUTU> TGPO: Yes, I need it to be on the SATA.
[08:26] <stockfisch> i disabled the first controllers in the BIOS therefor
[08:26] <PriceChild> amro: well done :)
[08:26] <PriceChild> amro: sorry i couldn't help :)
[08:26] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: getting to you sorry
[08:26] <TehBigToe> ok
[08:26] <TGPO> MUTU your not getting it, the SATA isnt the "active" HD
[08:26] <stockfisch> installing on a slave disk could be tricky though
[08:26] <kane77> TGPO, well I was just asking wheter the 6.10 version has some partition editor... that was all...
[08:27] <tschentz> and on the client edit /etc/fstab  and fill in something like this : 192.168.101.21:/home/tschentz /home/tschentz/tschentz nfs
[08:27] <stockfisch> kane77: did you take the alternate install cd?
[08:27] <MUTU> TGPO: you're not getting it. I need it installed on the SATA. That's what's booting first in my system, and that's where Windows is.
[08:27] <tschentz> this will mount the share directory to /home/tschentz/tschentz on the client
[08:28] <hydrogen> MUTU, hd0 may be the sata harddrive then
[08:28] <hydrogen> MUTU, grubs nomenclature is a bit hard to understand
[08:28] <TGPO> MUTU then hd0 would be the correct drive
[08:28] <MUTU> can't I force it somehow to be on the SATA? do i have to assume that hd0 is the SATA?
[08:28] <stockfisch> MUTU: grub will be installed on the sata only if you disable the ide controller where other disks hang on
[08:28] <hydrogen> err
[08:28] <hydrogen> no
[08:28] <hydrogen> it depends on bios boot order
[08:29] <hydrogen> hd0 is the first device booted
[08:29] <hydrogen> iirc
[08:29] <stockfisch> it did not help here
[08:29] <hydrogen> hd1 is second
[08:29] <stockfisch> not always
[08:29] <hydrogen> a simple way to check
[08:29] <MUTU> first device booted is my DVD-ROM though.
[08:29] <hydrogen> is go to the command line
[08:29] <stockfisch> grub masses up hd0 and sd0 in my case
[08:29] <cchristianTPclon> hello
[08:29] <cchristianTPclon> How do I edit "grub.config"?
[08:29] <cchristianTPclon> I'm getting the Infamous Error 17 again
[08:29] <cchristianTPclon> and Compaq did it
[08:29] <hydrogen> grub doens't know what sd0 is i don't believe
[08:30] <hydrogen> MUTU, go to the commandline, run `grub` and check out tab completion to see what grub thinks is what
[08:30] <stockfisch> and thats the point
[08:30] <TGPO> grub doesnt differentiat hd and sd ... its all hd to grub
[08:30] <hydrogen> if you type (hd0,<TAB> it should show you all the partitions on that drive
[08:30] <stockfisch> during installation configure it asks for installation on sd0
[08:30] <webweaver2006> question - how to set up a serial mouse and does ubuntu recognize isa cards
[08:30] <hydrogen> see if thats your sata drive
[08:30] <stockfisch> but installs on hd0
[08:30] <cchristianTPclon> HELLO.
[08:30] <derFlo> gibts auch n programm mit dem man die CPU temperatur messen kann? (habn asrock p4vt8 mb)
[08:30] <hydrogen> cchristianTPclon, vi /boot/grub/grub.conf
[08:30] <hydrogen> or /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:31] <cchristianTPclon> hydrogen: what???
[08:31] <stockfisch> if you deactivate all hds except for cdrom, it will take sd0 as hd0 under grub
[08:31] <stockfisch> very weird, but it helped for me
[08:31] <Max-O-Matic> tschentz    /etc/exports   on server---> /sharedirectory IPserver(options) IPclient(options)
[08:31] <cchristianTPclon> I can't get into the system, can I do it from BIOS?
[08:31] <TGPO> stockfisch: grub see's everything as hd it doesnt know sd
[08:32] <hydrogen> cchristianTPclon, hit 'e' at the grub menu
[08:32] <Lattyware> Hey all, I'm trying to make a WinXP install disc from a recovery disc to use with VMware. I have got the files needed, made the iso (mkisofs -o path path) and made WMware boot off it, but it's saying no bootable CD
[08:32] <hydrogen> you can edit it in place
[08:32] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: could you try sudo apt-get update again see if things change?
[08:32] <cchristianTPclon> how do I get the GRUB menu?
[08:32] <hydrogen> then use 'b' to boot the edited entry
[08:32] <Lattyware> Is there a special way to make the ISO bootable
[08:32] <stockfisch> yes, but during installation in the ubuntu setup ist asks for installation on sd0
[08:32] <stockfisch> in my case
[08:32] <TehBigToe> ok PriceChild
[08:32] <MUTU> I don't get it. I'll try installing Ubuntu some other time.
[08:32] <stockfisch> which is hd0 under ubuntu
[08:32] <angusprune> tschentz: how do I find out the IP addresses? the network has a DHCP server, or can I put wild cards in there?
[08:32] <enyc> hd0 ??
[08:32] <fido> hello
[08:32] <jluthman> i'm having big brother (a monitoring tool) and it uses the local ping utility to see if a host it alive - i have three interfaces on this box and it will on able to respond on one interface (so you must do a ping -I eth0 10.0.0.10) - but i don't know how to modify the software to do it this way; can anyone tell me how to change the metric measurement on the interfaces?
[08:32] <enyc> aad hd0 in grub you mean?
[08:33] <stockfisch> yes
[08:33] <tim167> cchristianTPclon: press escape on startup, when you see grum
[08:33] <tim167> cchristianTPclon i mean GRUB
[08:33] <cchristianTPclon> tim167: ok
[08:33] <tschentz> @<angusprune> yes you can also enter wildcards, e.g. 192.168.0.*
[08:33] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, now there's no error messages
[08:33] <enyc> stockfisch: the kerenl will see things like 'hda' 'sda' etc...   (hd0) is what grub sees as BIOS INT 13 drive 0x80
[08:33] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: yay :)
[08:33] <PriceChild> TehBigToe: no try "sudo apt-get upgrade"
[08:33] <cchristianTPclon> so...  after COMPAQ dissapears, hit esc?
[08:33] <stockfisch> you are completely right
[08:34] <stockfisch> but i cant describe the problem eny better...
[08:34] <TehBigToe> PriceChild, now 0 updates
[08:34] <TehBigToe> :D
[08:34] <Lattyware> Anyone?
[08:34] <fido> hello
[08:34] <TGPO> Lattyware: wrong channel
[08:34] <fido> que cosa??
[08:35] <webweaver2006> how do you deactivate usb at bootup?
[08:35] <Lattyware> TGPO: Not really, I'm doing it within ubuntu
[08:35] <cchristianTPclon> tim167: so...  after COMPAQ dissapears, hit esc?
[08:35] <Lattyware> or is there a #bootablecds?
[08:35] <fido> help. i have an error PCI: Cannot allocate resource region
[08:35] <stockfisch> enyc: maybe this is an error with the nforce4 chipset. it completely ignores the ide and sata bootorder. ide ALWAYS comes first
[08:35] <tim167> cchristianTPclon: something like that yes, you have to watch your screen closely, and hit esc as soon as GRUB shows up
[08:36] <amro> PriceChild: Thanks a lot for helping!
[08:36] <cchristianTPclon> ok trying
[08:36] <dfcarney> Lattyware: yeah, but that's like saying that you need help with an online site because you surf the web from a browser in Ubuntu.
[08:36] <tim167> cchristianTPclon: good luck :-D
[08:36] <cchristianTPclon> oops!  I had it
[08:36] <LinTux> When I go into the Gimp I get a paint trail on the cursor, how can I turn it off
[08:36] <Remaille> hi
[08:36] <Lattyware> dfcarney: I guess...
[08:36] <Remaille> has anyone already used wake on lan ?
[08:36] <dfcarney> Lattyware: either way, I'm sorry that I can't help you.  I don't know the solution to your problem.
[08:36] <Lattyware> fair enough
[08:37] <LinTux>  When I go into the Gimp I get a paint trail on the cursor, how can I turn it off
[08:38] <cchristianTPclon> tim167: so...  when it says "GRUB Loading stage 1.5"?
[08:39] <tim167> cchristianTPclon: yes, actually I think it also says something like : "hit escape to enter grub menu" but you dont have much time...
[08:39] <cchristianTPclon> hmmmm...
[08:39] <cchristianTPclon> no it dosnt
[08:39] <cchristianTPclon> tim167: It says:
[08:40] <kurei> hi
[08:40] <xenonn31> hello, i want to have aceleration graphics in my intel gma 945
[08:40] <xenonn31> what should i do ?
[08:40] <cchristianTPclon> GRUB Loading stage1.5
[08:40] <cchristianTPclon> GRUB loading, please wait...
[08:40] <cchristianTPclon> Error 17
[08:40] <xenonn31> is that possible?
[08:40] <tim167> cchristianTPclon: I'm not sure, maybe it only allows this menu if you have multiple kernels/os-es installed...?
[08:41] <cchristianTPclon> I have XP and Ubuntu
[08:41] <xenonn31> I learnt, something about beryl, aiglx k is that what i should install ?
[08:41] <cchristianTPclon> it's a Compaq Presario V5000
[08:41] <tim167> cchristianTPclon: yes, but maybe, that error message means grub could not load
[08:41] <kurei> i've installed java 6 on my machine... unfortunately its not listed when i do a sudo update-alternatives --configure java. Does anyone know how to set my default jre to 1.6?
[08:41] <cchristianTPclon> CTO
[08:41] <eddie> I can print with ubunta, but i can't print with suse, why/what is this
[08:42] <cchristianTPclon> no, the COMPAQ support person showed me this: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/grub-error-guide.xml
[08:42] <cchristianTPclon> it say what error 17 is
=== evan_ is now known as Okt
[08:44] <cchristianTPclon> eddie: "restore Partition"?
[08:44] <tim167> cchristianTPclon: your HD partition seems to be broken
[08:44] <Hoxzer> I get "you need a flashplayer" notices from sites although I have flashplugin-nonfree installed what causes this?
[08:44] <cchristianTPclon> tim167: huh?
[08:45] <yeager> stockfisch: did you like qbittorrent?
[08:45] <jrib> Hoxzer: probably you have version 7 and the site wants a newer one
[08:45] <tim167> cchristianTPclon:  at least: grub cannot load the partition its supposed to, see your link : " This error is returned if the partition requested exists, but the filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB."
[08:46] <jrib> eddie: maybe try #suse
[08:46] <semboy> !nvy
[08:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[08:49] <yeager> Digit0: try something better, like qbittorrent
[08:49] <jrib> !automatix | semboy
[08:49] <ubotu> semboy: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[08:58] <reverseblade> Hello , I have just compiled my kernel, but the boot proces just halts
[08:58] <n2diy> jrib, I want to locate the command xastir, and not list everything else that contains xastir, like the source files, I checked the man page, and tried -r xastir, but no luck.
[08:58] <cchristianTPclon> how do I edit GRUB.CONF?
[08:58] <cchristianTPclon> ANYONE?
[08:58] <stockfisch> too easy to look at that point... too windows like ;-)
[08:58] <reverseblade> Begin: Waiting for root file system..  it just hangs
[08:58] <jrib> Hoxzer: try without extensions (create a new firefox profile).  What is the exact error string you get on the site?
[08:58] <yeager> packagedeliverer: or this http://lichota.net/~krzysiek/projects/ubuntu-livecd-customization/
[08:58] <jrib> cchristianTPclon: sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst     is that what you mean?  And please don't use caps
[08:58] <yeager> cchristianTPclon: sudo vi /boot/grub/grub.conf
[08:59] <reggaemanu> yeager, yeah, i can send files to my comp, but send from the comp doesn't work, it don't find the phone (in fact obex search device with  hidd --search (wich doesn't find my phone) and with hcitool scan it find it, that's weird
[08:59] <oskude> cchristianTPclon: as you would edit any other text file... if that GRUB.CONF is a textfile... (remember: its case sensitive)
[08:59] <jrib> n2diy: I would just do:  locate xastir | grep bin
[08:59] <packagedeliverer> it's not customizing a livecd but making one out of a modified system (so, I removed/edited the stuff I learned at college and now I need to make a live cd out of it)
[08:59] <yeager> reggaemanu: ah, your dongle is not in the correct mode (listening mode or what it is called)
[09:00] <boOkwo7m> jrib: no doesn't work either ..
[09:00] <packagedeliverer> http://www.linux-live.org/ so using this package... I just need to know how to recompile the kernel
[09:00] <reggaemanu> yeager, how can i change that? there is nothing on the key to change modes...
[09:00] <jrib> boOkwo7m: pastebin all the stuff you get when you do    /set log
[09:00] <boOkwo7m> i must be missing something simple ..  how do i activate logging?  is autolog = on enough?
[09:00] <cchristianTPclon> AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE: I cannot turn on the computer, it is not getting past the initial boot.
[09:00] <jrib> boOkwo7m: yes, it should be

[09:01] <ubotu> cchristianTPclon: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.

[09:01] <yeager> grub error 17 means that it doesn't find or can't mount the filesystem/partition
[09:02] <n2diy> jrib, that works a lot better than plane locate, still turns up a bunch of stuff I don't need, but it does tell what I need no know, tnx.
[09:02] <jrib> boOkwo7m: if you edited config while irssi is running it may save the values it had when it exits

[09:03] <Joakim> When I open new program, it lays under all of the other programs that is running

[09:03] <derFlo> HI
[09:03] <miniman> Can anyone recommend a good firewalll?
[09:04] <yeager> miniman: iptables

[09:04] <derFlo> florian@florian-desktop:~$ wmsensors -i
[09:04] <derFlo> Could not locate or open config file!
[09:04] <ubotu> miniman: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[09:04] <Zodiac`> after i've installed wolfenstein: Enemy territory on linux, how to launch it?
[09:04] <boOkwo7m> jrib: ?
[09:04] <derFlo> how can i fix that problem?
[09:04] <miniman> Sweet, thanks!
[09:04] <jrib> boOkwo7m: I don't think it's case-sensitive
[09:04] <Joakim> I' try to explain better
[09:04] <Joakim> I'll
[09:04] <Joakim> Say I run Firefox, and opens Gaim
[09:05] <kurei> how do i add installers in my local directory into synaptic?
[09:05] <packagedeliverer> one last question, I have a shellscript runme.sh ... as a noob, typing the 'filename' or 'exec filename' or 'open filename' haven't done much...
[09:05] <Joakim> Then Gaim lays down under Firefox
[09:05] <Joakim> So I have to click on Gaim from the Panel
[09:05] <jrib> !enter | Joakim

[09:05] <boOkwo7m> jrib: where do i set the autolog?  atm i set it in the server section .. ?
[09:05] <Zodiac`> after i've installed wolfenstein: Enemy territory on linux, how to launch it?
[09:06] <packagedeliverer> thanks !
[09:06] <jrib> boOkwo7m: just do  /set autlog on   followed by   /save
[09:06] <jrib> boOkwo7m: but spell autolog right :)
[09:06] <boOkwo7m> jrib: :p
[09:06] <LePousson> I just wanted to know if it is possible to have an ubuntu-desktop acting as a DHCP and Apache/MySQL/PHP server ?
[09:07] <jrib> !lamp | LePousson
[09:07] <ubotu> LePousson: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[09:07] <oskude> LePousson: but of course!
[09:07] <n2diy> how can I determine the size of a directory?
[09:07] <sharperguy> !ubotu
[09:07] <LePousson> ok oskude ... thanks jrib
[09:07] <jrib> n2diy: du -sh
[09:07] <joni> n2diy: use du
[09:08] <yeager> n2diy: du -h --max-depth=1  (lists all directories too)
[09:09] <jrib> n2diy: or right click > properties
[09:09] <uffiole> i like du * -sch
[09:09] <n2diy> Jrib, et al thanksl, du /usr takes a while to run! I'll try right clicking in nautilus.
[09:10] <kurei> how do i add local repositories to synaptic?
[09:10] <ReinH> Guys, are there any issues with dual booting a computer with two hard drives and using the first for windows and the second for Ubuntu?
[09:10] <nevron> issue?
[09:10] <ReinH> I've never done it, so I'm wondering if there are any gotchas
[09:11] <ReinH> or is it as easy as partitioningo one hard drive?
[09:11] <oskude> ReinH: you just "have" to install grub to the mbr of the harddrive that is set as boot device in bios...
[09:11] <kni1> What file do I need to edit on the webserver to be able to connect to it internally?
[09:11] <mefistofeles> hey
[09:12] <ReinH> oskude: ok, so I install grub on the boot drive.
[09:12] <n2diy> Jrib, did you mean right click on the directory from nautilus? That just tells me free disk space.
[09:12] <mefistofeles> why is that ubuntu doesnt have alsaconf?... any special reason?
[09:12] <duckfish> Is there something like Taskbar Shuffle (WinXP) for Ubuntu? I want to be able to rearrange the order of the windows in the Window List
[09:12] <superkirbyartist> I have a lot of issues with Ubuntu on my old iMac.
[09:12] <jrib> n2diy: look at the "Contents" field
[09:12] <oskude> ReinH: if you dont use other methods (boot floppy). yes
[09:13] <ReinH> oskude: Ok, would I need a partition on that drive for it, then?
[09:13] <kishan> duckfish------ right click on menue and choose edit menue
[09:13] <n2diy> jrib, ah ha, the directory I chose was an empty one, I got it now.
[09:13] <ReinH> Would it make more sense to just put the '/' partition on the boot drive and put /home on the second HDD? I've got 12GB to spare on the first drive
[09:13] <oskude> ReinH: mbr is allready on every hd, you dont need to create it, it just will be overwritten (the ms windows bootloader)
[09:14] <ReinH> oskude: oh, ok. I see what you mean now
[09:14] <oskude> ReinH: MBR = Master Boot Record, i think wikipedia has more info, if you want
[09:14] <ReinH> oskude: How would I typically specify where to install grub?
[09:14] <kishan> !mbr
[09:14] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[09:15] <zero_> hola muy buenas
[09:15] <oskude> ReinH: for mbr, it ask on which hd

[09:15] <duckfish> kishan: I don't see 'edit menu'.. right-clicking on windows shows 'minimize', 'maximize', etc, and right-clicking on the window list shows 'add to panel', 'properties', 'delete this panel', etc
[09:15] <ReinH> oskude: ok, perfect
[09:15] <Zodiac`> i write et in terminal, but enemy territory wont lauch.. why? is it some graphic card error?
[09:15] <ReinH> I'm clearing off the HDD as we speak. In ... 220 minutes I'll probably be back with more questions ;)
[09:15] <ReinH> Thanks for the help
[09:16] <Zodiac`> i write et in terminal, but enemy territory wont lauch.. why? is it some graphic card error?
[09:16] <boOkwo7m> jrib: Thanks!  I got my logging working now! :)
[09:16] <kishan> duckfish:right click on the application option of mnue and u will see edit menue
[09:16] <oskude> ReinH: btw, which ubuntu you install ? i remember "old" (dapper?) didnt give you that option thou... meaning the graphicalk installer
[09:16] <Curs0r> hey can someone please help me with xdmcp? when i load an app that uses qt, or tk or gecko or even console for the interface everything is great. when i load an app that uses gtk for the interface it takes 3-5 minutes to load

[09:16] <whyameye> inkscape isn't importing ai files like it should.  when I try to import I am getting "Use of uninitialized value in subtraction (-) at /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/ill2svg.pl line 318,..."
[09:16] <ReinH> oskude: I have a dapper CD I was going to use, but maybe I'll try the new (edgy?)
[09:16] <kishan> duckfish: go to system---preferences---menue layout
[09:17] <ReinH> oskude: what would you recommend?
[09:17] <Zodiac`> nolimitsoya, hey m8 :) you know something about enemy territory? (wolfenstein) "i write et in terminal, but enemy territory wont lauch.. why? is it some graphic card error?"
[09:17] <oskude> ReinH: im not sure if dapper was "ok", hope someone knows here (i normally use the alternate old text based installer and it "allways" had that option)
[09:17] <boOkwo7m> jrib: I tried doing things manually (the way I like) but when I did it automatically (/set autolog on  and then /save) i saw my mistakes.  Now it all works. :)
[09:18] <kishan> oskude: ubuntu installintion install grub at mbr by default
[09:18] <ReinH> oskude: what version of Ubuntu would you prefer for a non critical (second development computer) install?
[09:18] <oskude> whyameye: you could try export to svg in freehand and open that in inkscape... and this is (will be) yummy too http://xaraxtreme.org/
[09:18] <ReinH> anyone else please comment too
[09:18] <Fleebailey66> i liked yaboot on powerpc better
[09:18] <oskude> kishan: but does dapper live cd have option in which hd mbr ?
[09:18] <jrib> ReinH: edgy
[09:19] <Curs0r> ReinH, always good to stay current on a dev machine, edgy
[09:19] <ReinH> jrib: how "edgy" is edgy? Is it stable yet?
[09:19] <chorse> ReinH: Edgy, no doubt
[09:19] <superkirbyartist> I am using yaboot.
[09:19] <ReinH> Sry, I haven't been keeping up.
[09:19] <oskude> ReinH: dapper and edgy are stable, dapper just has longer support (and edgy more actual software)
[09:19] <jrib> ReinH: it was released in october
[09:19] <whyameye> oskude: is freehand in the repos?
[09:19] <Curs0r> ReinH, edgy could not be more stable imho
[09:19] <oskude> whyameye: heh ? adobe freehand is the tool that makes .ai files...
[09:19] <kishan> oskude: there is no option of where to install grub .it installs on mbr by default
[09:19] <chorse> oskude: more recent software :)
[09:19] <Zodiac`> enemy territory says: "Sys_Error: Error during initialization"
[09:19] <mc__> Curs0r: I experienced a lot more problems with edgy
[09:19] <duckfish> kishan: I'm using gnome on dapper, I don't see 'menu layout', only 'menus and toolbars' and 'windows', and neither of them have the option to do what I want
[09:20] <ReinH> jrib, oskude, Curs0r: awesome, thanks. I'll install edgy on this one and then upgrade the one I'm on now from Dapper to Edgy as well
[09:20] <bradley_> i was setting up thunderbird but i can't find a systray setting-- how do i get it to run in the background?
[09:20] <Fleebailey66> superkirbyartist, how is it on x86?
[09:20] <superkirbyartist> The monitor's colors are messed up and I have KDE stuff, though.
[09:20] <oskude> kishan: you said that allready, but can you choose on which harddisk mbr ?
[09:20] <whyameye> oskude: oh. So i'd have to move to a Windows machine w/ freehand on it...
[09:20] <Fleebailey66> can it dual boot windows?
[09:20] <Curs0r> mc__, the things that used to crush FC6 on this pc are nothing to edgy
[09:20] <kishan> oskude: sorry i have no experince with two hard disks
[09:20] <ReinH> kishan: So if I'm installing Ubuntu on a second drive, will grub be installed correctly by default?
[09:21] <oskude> whyameye: dunno, i though it was an .ai you made with freehand... i never imported such files in inkscape...
[09:21] <ReinH> kishan: oic, never mind ;)
[09:21] <con-man> how do I set up aiglx
[09:21] <ShminkyBoy> lol
[09:21] <con-man> anyone?
[09:21] <ShminkyBoy> this is weird
[09:21] <Fleebailey66> ReinH, you can install it on the second drive where ubuntu is or you can install it on the master
[09:21] <Curs0r> con-man, you don't really set up aiglx
[09:21] <ShminkyBoy> <-- first xchat use
[09:21] <Fleebailey66> with alt cd at least
[09:21] <con-man> Curs0r: ok
[09:21] <oskude> ReinH: im pretty sure edgy has option (in graphical installer) to select which hd mbr to install
[09:21] <con-man> Curs0r: its not an option when I log on
[09:22] <Curs0r> con-man, that's a pretty well documented procedure at ubuntuguide.org
[09:22] <Aquarius> Can someone tell me how to de-register from launchpad?
[09:22] <ReinH> Cool, well worst thing that could happen is that it doesn't give me the option to boot from the 2nd drive, right?
[09:22] <Curs0r> con-man, what gpu?
[09:22] <kishan> ReinH: one suggestion install the dual boot on hard disk 1 and make fat partion on other hard disk so that u can use for both windows and ubuntu
[09:22] <whyameye> oskude: it's an ai a graphic designer made for me. She tried to export to svg for me but somehow the svg is bitmapped...
[09:22] <con-man> Curs0r: nvidia 7600
[09:23] <jrib> Aquarius: try #launchpad maybe
[09:23] <oskude> ReinH: no, the worst that can happen is that it install grub in hd2 mbr, and that is not set as boot hd in bios, so windows bootloader is started from hd1 (if that the boot hd in bios)
[09:23] <superkirbyartist> How can I use my iMac modem?
[09:23] <ReinH> oskude: right, which would just mean it would boot into windows as normal, right?
[09:23] <Curs0r> con-man, follow this http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Beryl.2FAIGLX_.28Nvidia.29 but don't install the beta driver, use the normal one
[09:23] <drivera90> G'day. What command do I use to get x-chat?
[09:23] <oskude> whyameye: lol, so, inkscape cant read .ai and freehand cant export svg... pick your blame ;)
[09:23] <Fleebailey66> best dual boot site
[09:23] <Fleebailey66> http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/
[09:24] <oskude> ReinH: yup
[09:24] <kishan> oskude: i think in the bios there is option of booting from which hard disk
[09:24] <ReinH> kishan: There are now drivers for WinXP to read/write EXT partitions
[09:24] <oskude> kishan: yes, but to have to change that for changing os is not a nice option..
[09:24] <ReinH> And TBH I'm less worried about borking windows, so I don't mind using them
[09:24] <drivera90> apt-get install x-chat?
[09:24] <whyameye> oskude: the thing is that inkscape is supposed to be able to read ai with the perlmagick package installed. But I am getting an error and Google isn't helping me. I'm downloading xara now...
[09:25] <minerale> what is the name for the restricted (?native?) ati drivers ?
[09:25] <kishan> ReinH: but it is alwys safe to use fat common to both linux and windows
[09:25] <Curs0r> con-man, son you will be happy like this http://123pichosting.com/images/2614Screenshot-4.png
[09:25] <Curs0r> soon*
[09:25] <ReinH> kishan: sure, but I may run into the file size restriction
[09:25] <oskude> well, and how about searching why freehand cant export svg ? its an open standard so there are no objections...
[09:26] <oskude> whyameye: and xaraxtreme is not "ready" yet, so it maybe doesnt read .ai files...
[09:26] <kishan> oskude if one install the ubuntu and windows on say hard disk 1 so grub will be on one right
[09:26] <dcordes> how can i install beryl form svn? i'm using edgy
[09:26] <drivera90> What command do I use to install x-chat (or any similar IRC app)?
[09:26] <oskude> kishan: yup, with the "old" installer
[09:27] <oskude> whyameye: and ai files and svg are not complitely compatible...
[09:27] <n2diy> driver90 apt-get install xchat.
[09:27] <kishan> oskude: in live cd there is no option of where to install the grup it automatically checks for the other OS and install the grub at MBR thats what happened for me
[09:27] <oskude> kishan: you mean dapper ?
[09:28] <kishan> oskude: yes
[09:28] <oskude> kishan: roger

[09:29] <Joakim> Ok
[09:29] <we6jb1> I am looking for a motherboard that is 100% compatible with ubuntu
[09:29] <oskude> whyameye: well, i assume ai is a closed file spec, no ?

[09:31] <Joakim> I have a problem. When I opens a program, for example, Gaim. If I have some other program open, Gaim will lay under all of the other programs. So, to get Gaim on the top, I need to click on it on the panel. It some kind of minimized when I opens it. Somebody know how to fix this?
[09:32] <we6jb1> I think 2 or something mhz
[09:32] <Curs0r> we6jb1, mobo-wise that places you in a terrible position for linux. someone else may be able to recommend something with that arch
[09:32] <kishan> oskude: as far i came to know when u hibernate the information is stored in swap and it should actually re read from the swap when i push the power button is my understanding right
[09:33] <whyameye> oskude: yeah she gave me an svg file but it is bitmapped. She doesn't know how else to save as svg...
[09:33] <oskude> kishan: or ram. yes thats the only i "know" too :)

[09:47] <W7DAHawk> I'm using Ubuntu 6.10 the Edgy Eft
[09:47] <W7DAHawk> I've been connecting to a Windows Server 2000 Terminal Server.
[09:47] <W7DAHawk> I have been using BOTH "Gnome RDP" and "Terminal Server Client" (tsclient) successfully.
[09:47] <W7DAHawk> Problem: the Windows Server 2000 makes the connection license "temporary" for 90-Days unless I connect using Windows XP Pro.
[09:47] <W7DAHawk> It works just fine for 90-days at a time then starts giving warning messages a few days before the 90th day expiration of the temporary license.

[09:55] <extern> I already tried, but I don't think that I succeeded, because I can't login to it
[09:55] <W7DAHawk> CursOr it's an issue RELATED to an app that is included with Ubuntu, if you don't have the knowledge to answer the question, it's not helpful to simply lay it elsewhere
[09:55] <extern> what paramteres should I use to create a default user?
[09:55] <extern> which should be created by the installation
[09:55] <Curs0r> Capslock118, i had problems with routed connections and DC only allowing 1 connection at a time because the router was sending its ip for every connection
[09:56] <oskude> RichB: you can restart the gnome panel with "killall gnome-panel"
[09:56] <Curs0r> W7DAHawk, working for 90 days then suddenly stopping sounds like a cal issue to me
[09:56] <Capslock118> Curs0r: what did you do to fix that? Also, I tried while local machine was not logged in, and it still gave me the issue
[09:56] <oskude> !adduser | extern
[09:56] <ubotu> extern: To add new users to your Ubuntu system, follow the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddUsersHowto - For administrative privileges, users need to be made members of the group "admin" - See !sudo
[09:56] <Curs0r> Capslock118, does your router by chance have a dmz host set?
[09:56] <RichB> oskude: How do I issue the command killall ? That's my problem you see
[09:57] <W7DAHawk> Great, thanks fot the help, sheez. THis is joke
[09:57] <Curs0r> what an idiot, he just didn't read the server 2000 ts manual
[09:57] <Capslock118> Curs0r: i could have a machine set to dmz, but I currently do now, plus, I think that is only for external network connections
[09:57] <Capslock118> not*
[09:57] <Curs0r> well dc is external right?
[09:57] <oskude> RichB: if you cant get a terminal, you could go to ctrl+alt+f1, login and type that (ctrl+alt+f7 gets you back in x windows)
[09:58] <Capslock118> Curs0r: i am only trying to have a machine that is in the local network connect
[09:58] <Capslock118> and I am trying to direct dc++ to the local IP and not the external IP
[09:58] <Capslock118> i will try that real quick though
[09:58] <Curs0r> Capslock118,  you want something from outside your network to connect to something inside your network right?
[09:59] <RichB> oskude: So how do I get to a terminal if gnome-panel isn't working?
[09:59] <Capslock118> Curs0r: no, machine a has the hub, machine b which is on the same network cannot connect to machine a's hub
[09:59] <oskude> RichB: maybe with alt+f2 (or what i said earlier)
[09:59] <RichB> oskude: Is there any GUI way of doing that
[09:59] <RichB> oskude: It's my wife's computer and she's not really used to doing command line stuff
[09:59] <Capslock118> sais actively refused by target machine...no firewall is turned on either machine
[09:59] <oskude> RichB: you can start gnome-terminal with alt+f2 ?
[10:00] <oskude> RichB: well, you could allso try alt+f2, type xkill and then select the gnome panel with the skull...
[10:00] <Curs0r> Capslock118, is there maybe some internal dc setting you need to change to allow hosts? I'm sorry it's been a while since i used dc
[10:01] <RichB> oskude: Tried alt-F2 but nothing happens. I guess whatever was watching for that has hung
[10:01] <Capslock118> Curs0r: its ok, your help is really appreciated, I am not entirely sure about that, the config in opendchub seems to be set up correctly
[10:01] <oskude> RichB: ah ok, then your best bet is virtual terminal, ctrl+alt+f1
[10:01] <warlock> How to shutdown eth0, and turn it on again? (like rebooting the network) ?
[10:01] <RichB> oskude: Cheers. It's not ideal. Hopefully there'll be something much better in Fiesty
[10:01] <Curs0r> oskude, i'm not going crazy right? that guy was having an issue with his temporary cal expiring right?
[10:02] <oskude> warlock: sudo ifdown eth0
[10:02] <warlock> then to turn it on again?
[10:02] <II`et|Weirdo> and sudo ifup eth0
[10:02] <oskude> RichB: and that would be ?
[10:02] <tjb891> does anyone here  use the ehome netoworking wireless card they were selling for 1.99 at compusa this black friday?
[10:03] <Capslock118> setting the external port did nothing
[10:03] <warlock> I think there's an another ocmmand for this, isnt there? :o
[10:03] <oskude> Curs0r: dunno
[10:03] <warlock> And is there a way to 'refresh' the network ip?
[10:03] <oskude> warlock: you mean sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[10:03] <eegore> in dapper, where in the inittab is the setting to set the run level to level 3
[10:04] <m12> when I open "localhost"  in Firefox, then click on phpmyadmin, it loads the "save file" screen.  what is my problem?
[10:04] <Curs0r> Capslock118, I don't know what to tell you, other than that you my need to connect to the external ip of the hub if it won't bind to local and external
[10:04] <oskude> m12: php not installed/configured/running right, maybe...
[10:04] <warlock> And is there a way to reboot SSH?
[10:04] <extern> how can I install synaptic package manager? I don't seem to be able to find it anywhere, I believe it is not installed
[10:04] <warlock> restart*
[10:04] <Curs0r> m12, your php preprocessor is not functioning
[10:05] <oskude> warlock: guess ? sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
[10:05] <extern> and there's no add/remove option under applications either
[10:05] <spunk_> Any suggestions for a desent viewer for realplayer, quicktime or windows media? (all streaming)
[10:05] <m12> so I need to get what?
[10:05] <m12> php5?
[10:05] <Curs0r> oskude, sshd?
[10:05] <spunk_> tried vlc but no luck.. :-(

[10:06] <narvik86> spunk_: mplayer is not working? or realplayer?
[10:06] <nolimitsoya> foo, id suggest you go with the 368 one till those are sorted

[10:06] <spunk_> Any experiences from using realplayer?
[10:07] <foo> nolimitsoya: ok, thanks
[10:07] <spunk_> narvik86, have not tried mplayer. do I need Windows Codecs for that or are codecs included with the package?
[10:07] <spunk_> narvik86, do you have any experience from realplayer under Ubuntu? does it work decent enough?
[10:08] <narvik86> spunk_: w32codecs are for mplayer they support wmv but i don't know about other
[10:08] <Curs0r> spunk_, mplayer is awesome
[10:08] <narvik86> spunk_: realplayer 10 works fine with real media streaming
[10:08] <spunk_> narvik86, ok. Ill give mplayer a spin then. Is it better than vlc in your opinion?
[10:08] <RichB> oskude: The ideal UI would be something more like Windows that doesn't require a command line to fix things when the shell dies/hangs.
[10:09] <spunk_> Curs0r, , ok. Ill give mplayer a spin then. Is it better than vlc in your opinion?
[10:09] <ReWT_AxS> i like xmms
[10:09] <Curs0r> spunk_, imo way better
[10:09] <mc__> RichB: why dont you like the command line?
[10:09] <narvik86> spunk_: its much better for video files on hdd
[10:09] <oskude> RichB: what ? i thought the gui freezed... as alt+f2 didnt work anymore...
[10:09] <spunk_> Curs0r, narvik86, ok
[10:09] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, nothing can ever replace xmms as my audio player
[10:09] <RichB> oskude: Correct. alt-f2 didn't work.
[10:09] <spunk_> Curs0r, narvik86, thanks for your help! bye!
[10:09] <ReWT_AxS> :)
[10:09] <mc__> i like the command line,and i hope that i never gets replaced totally by GUI's
[10:10] <narvik86> spunk_: good luck
[10:10] <RichB> mc__: I'm a programmer. I like the command line. My wife, however, is a marketing manager. She doesn't understand the command line
[10:10] <hjmills> mc__ i agree
[10:10] <we6jb1> I have a question
[10:10] <RichB> And the Edgy box in question is her computer
[10:10] <Curs0r> mc__, as long as shell developers make mistakes, the console will be there
[10:10] <nolimitsoya> RichB, if the windows shell dies you are dead in the water. in linux you have the command line as a last resort, without having to boot the install cd in recovery mode to access it ;)
[10:10] <we6jb1> Is there a channel or a place where I can go to ask questions about signing messages?
[10:10] <oskude> RichB: so, if in ms-windows the gui freezed (ctrl+alt+del) doesnt work, you can only restart... on ubuntu you can go to ctrl+alt+f1 and do something for the console... so, cli rules over gui ;)
[10:10] <hjmills> RichB: then lets hope to get to a state where linux users can use or ignore the command line as they see fit
[10:10] <mc__> RichB: if you drive a car you should know something about cars,so that you can fix things
[10:10] <mc__> RichB: it's the same with computers
[10:10] <RichB> Curs0r: The fact is that both Gnome and Windows have the shell dieing from time to time. I've yet to witness the shell dieing on OSX though.
=== Darst_ is now known as Darst
[10:11] <RichB> oskude: ctrl-alt-del always works. It is a hotkey that is not managed by the shell
[10:11] <nolimitsoya> RichB, same with ctrl+alt+backspace
[10:11] <oskude> RichB: what ever you say...
[10:11] <Curs0r> RichB, i don't argue the stability of OSX, i do argue it's extensibility and entertainment value though
[10:11] <RichB> nolimitsoya: You are not dead in the water if the shell dies. You have task manager. Always
[10:12] <A-L-A-R-M> hello, i just installed mplayer from the ubuntu repo and also  did copy the essential codecs in the /usr/local/lib/codecs dir . the problem is that although the avi are being played normaly with sound and image , i get an error on a window : request audio codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not available , enable it at compilation . what could i do to fix this ?
[10:12] <oskude> RichB: and as long computers are programmed with _text_, text based "rescue" will win!
[10:12] <RichB> nolimitsoya: ctrl-alt-del on Windows takes me to a fail-safe GUI that allows me to kill rogue tasks in a user-friendly manner. ctrl-backspace does not
[10:12] <nolimitsoya> RichB, which isnt realy helpfull in bringing the shell to live again, without killing stuff in a similar way to ctrl+alt+backspace
[10:12] <Curs0r> RichB, 2 whole viisual styles
[10:12] <nolimitsoya> RichB, ok, well thats a point...
[10:12] <RichB> mc__: Do you drive a car?
[10:13] <mc__> RichB: nope

[10:13] <RichB> nolimitsoya: ctrl-alt-del allows you to bring up task manager. From there it tells you which apps are not responding and allows you to kill them.
[10:14] <oskude> RichB: user friendly is very relative... and i find it very userfirendly to say on irc type this and that command, rather than clieck there scroll there and heres a screenshot...

[10:15] <Stargazers> What is the simpliest way in command line to rename ALL files in folder to 001.jpg, 002.jpg, 003.jpg etc etc etc. Files are now for example kili.jpg, rusina.jpg, 2s4ff.jpg etc.

[10:16] <RichB> nolimitsoya: That's true!
[10:16] <nolimitsoya> RichB, have you filed a bugreport?
[10:17] <Sumit108> Hi, I wanted a simple straight forward answer.... Can Ubuntu access NTFS/Fat32 partions
[10:17] <Druidor> its an acleptinv group & normally can get whatever you want played
[10:17] <narvik86> Stargazers: gnome-commander allows you to change multiple filenames

[10:17] <narvik86> Stargazers: oh, yes, wait a second
[10:18] <Stargazers> Thx.

[10:19] <gpd> any reason why this wireless card would work in Dapper out of the box - but not at all after Edgy upgrade?  D-Link DWL-G520
[10:19] <restiz> hi
[10:19] <nolimitsoya> oskude, RichB, one could always use gnomes keybinder to bind to the taskmanager
[10:19] <Sumit108> I'm not that prepared yet, like to you thunderbird and photoshop
[10:20] <Sumit108> i mean, I like to use
[10:20] <tiago> OIIIIIII
[10:20] <Pelo> gpd,  just perform modem setup from scratch again
[10:20] <RichB> nolimitsoya: A keystroke that will bring up system monitor even when gnome-panel is hung/dead. That way, it can be used for killing/restarting gnome-panel in a dire situation.
[10:20] <Curs0r> Sumit108, the Gimp is pretty much photoshop and thunderbird works fine in linux
[10:20] <nolimitsoya> Sumit108, thunderbird is no problem, and instead of photoshop you have the gimp
[10:20] <Sumit108> hmm,
[10:20] <gpd> Pelo: modem?

[10:20] <vanberge> is it necessary to perform a file sysstem check in ubuntu if the system crashes ?
[10:20] <nolimitsoya> Sumit108, yes, all that stuff
[10:21] <Curs0r> Sumit108, yup
[10:21] <evil_> In flash videos, is sound being off with the video a documented problem?
[10:21] <Curs0r> Sumit108, it even takes photoshop plugins
[10:21] <nolimitsoya> Sumit108, thunderbird can be installed with just typing 'sudo apt-get install mozilla-thunderbird' in a terminal
[10:21] <gpd> Pelo: you mean in Gnome Networking Wireless setup?
[10:21] <Sumit108> only one way to find out.... yeah that sounds like the shiznit

[10:22] <narvik86> Stargazers: i have it, but need to change few things
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> RichB, i don think the task manager in gnome is dependant on the panel, so just bind the shortcut you want :) file a bugreport suggesting making ctrl+alt+del the deafult shortcut
[10:22] <whyameye> evil_: yes. But flash9 solves it.
[10:22] <Sumit108> yeah!!!

[10:27] <hjmills> gah - are there any recent speed problems with firefox - irc is fine but web browsing is real slow
[10:27] <Curs0r> beyond*
[10:27] <Blah93> sumit: i do
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> Curs0r, im not disputing that. just wanted to make sure he knew that its not guaranteed to work :)
[10:27] <Sumit108> yes mate
[10:27] <hjmills> Sumit108: I do on my lappy
[10:27] <Sumit108> yeah, show da love
[10:27] <II`et|Weirdo> iperf -c local ip gave me the following: connection failed, refused write1 failed write2 failed broken pipe. I did the test because the speed of my ethernet connection is very poor (4kb/s) disabled ipv6, and all other possible ways mentioned on forums. Maybe another idea ?
[10:27] <Curs0r> nolimitsoya, ^^
[10:27] <CactusWiZaRd> loos: it works pretty well when your computer has cooled down a bit
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> whyameye, edgy, feisty. think its in dapper too, but as i said, you need the backports repo
[10:27] <mc44> Blah93: deb http://beryl-mirror.lupine.me.uk/ edgy main
[10:27] <CactusWiZaRd> loos: even though i haven't tried with Safety GUI
[10:27] <hjmills> Sumit108: tis unfortunate but I am currently needing to develop in MS Access
[10:27] <whyameye> nolimitsoya: I have the backports and it gave me 7 a week ago.
[10:27] <tony22> hi! im need to write a shell script that takes a file name ex: hello.wmv.001 and passes it on to cat like this cat hello.wmv.0??>hello.wmv , can this be done in bash alone or do i need to use some other language?
[10:27] <whyameye> whyameye: I'm on dapper
[10:28] <Sumit108> ah, access...
[10:28] <nolimitsoya> whyameye, thats strange indeed :) try again :)
[10:28] <whyameye> evil_: maybe nolimitsoya is right about flash9 now in the repos. If not, I followed the directions here: http://dschneller.blogspot.com/2006/10/flash-9-beta-in-ubuntu-dapper.html
[10:28] <ReWT_AxS> can someone please help me figure out what sound driver i need?
[10:28] <CactusWiZaRd> loos: what's the reason to use safety gui anyway?
[10:28] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, what chip?
[10:28] <hjmills> ReWT_AxS: check out the http://alsa-project.org
[10:28] <loos> I got a garbled UI when I didn't
[10:28] <ReWT_AxS> i dunno what chip
[10:28] <ReWT_AxS> how do i check
[10:28] <Blah93> graft: I added that to my sources.list, and typed 'sudo apt-get beryl-manager' but this is my output: Reading package lists... Done
[10:28] <Blah93> Building dependency tree
[10:28] <Blah93> Reading state information... Done
[10:28] <Blah93> E: Couldn't find package beryl-manager
[10:28] <evil_> tthanks whyameye
[10:28] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, lspci -v
[10:29] <Koala23> anything better then Totem for videos ?
[10:29] <hjmills> Blah93: if you are pasting use a paste bin
[10:29] <Blah93> koala: use vlc or mplayer
[10:29] <II`et|Weirdo> Koala23 --\> vlc :p
[10:29] <hjmills> Koala23: depends - totem-xine is way better than totem-gstreamer
[10:29] <Curs0r> Koala23, mplayer
[10:29] <Sumit108> umm, is there anything obvious, that linux cant do...
[10:29] <Blah93> hjmills: whats a paste bin?
[10:29] <CactusWiZaRd> loos: oh, but seriously, shut it down, let it cool over night and start it tomorrow, it should work
[10:29] <Blah93> hjmills: from what i know i'm not 'pasting'
[10:29] <whyameye> evil_, nolimitsoya: it *does* appear that the backports for dapper include version 9. So I stand corrected. Sorry.
[10:29] <Koala23> i have both install but by default the system uses Totem, how can i change that ?
[10:30] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r, http://pastebin.ca/282785
[10:30] <hjmills> Sumit108: tuck you up in bed, make your supper, monitor your fridge (oh no, scratch that last one)
[10:30] <nolimitsoya> whyameye, no problem :)
[10:30] <ReWT_AxS> says unknown?
[10:30] <hjmills> !pastebin > Blah93
[10:31] <Sumit108> yep... I dont think my machin has dual processor support yet, or a central food processing unit
[10:31] <hjmills> Sumit108: but for computery tasks you may have problems with some games but cedega rocks
[10:31] <Blah93> jkmills: huh?
[10:31] <aliendream23> quick question how do I terminate or totally end my x session and switch to console, please?

[10:31] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, oh boy, compaq
[10:31] <the_rick> Hey all.  I've been using SuSE 10.1 which has been horrible and I'm getting ready to scrap it and go to 10.2, but I thought I'd give ubuntu a shot also.  Just wondering on thoughts of Dapper vs Edgy.  I don't have to have the MOST stable thing out there, but I think I've heard some problems with Edgy.
[10:32] <nolimitsoya> RichB, thank you very much :) bugreporting is what keeps this project going :)
[10:32] <ReWT_AxS> internal speakers built into tower
[10:32] <ReWT_AxS> -.-
[10:32] <Blah93> does anybody know where i can get beryl-manager?
[10:32] <aliendream23> thanks
[10:32] <nolimitsoya> !beryl | Blah93
[10:32] <ubotu> Blah93: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[10:32] <ReWT_AxS> Blah93, sudo apt-get install beryl
[10:32] <Blah93> ReWT_AxS: doesn't work
[10:33] <Arigato> does the live cd have the remove desktop feature?
[10:33] <II`et|Weirdo> is here someone who experienced heavy ethernet problems (very very low speed 4kb/s isntead of 1.0MBit/s) and who fixed it
[10:33] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, it's a realtek chip if that helps
[10:33] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r, so what do i do
[10:33] <ReWT_AxS> :-\
[10:33] <Arigato> *does the live cd have the remote desktop feature?
[10:33] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, most likely an alc800 or 850
[10:33] <ReWT_AxS> i really need sound
[10:33] <ReWT_AxS> it's for work
[10:33] <hjmills> would you recommend installing kernel updates on a pc you never restart (i.e. a server)
[10:34] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, easy answer, go buy a sound blaster live
[10:34] <amorphous_> evening all
[10:34] <nolimitsoya> hjmills, no, never. always take your servers ofline for kernel upgrades
[10:34] <RichB> hjmills: If it's a security update, yes
[10:34] <hjmills> Arigato: yes i think
[10:34] <amorphous_> i was wondering....
[10:34] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r, I don't wanna send no money lol
[10:34] <ReWT_AxS> i just want these to work
[10:35] <Blah93> hjmills: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37626/
[10:35] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, sometimes people get lucky installing random realtek drivers in linux but the odds that you are going to find something that works for you are slim
[10:35] <hjmills> nolimitsoya: its not a major server - it runs my home dhcp and does my downloads but is it worth installing kernel updates when they are available on apt
[10:35] <Stargazers> narvik86: Thx.
[10:35] <nolimitsoya> hjmills, since they might include security updates, yes, always make sure to get them
[10:35] <reverseblade> Anyone experienced with ALSA her ?
[10:35] <reverseblade> here
[10:35] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, that spu has been kludged up by so many manufacturers that there are literally hundreds of versions of that chip
[10:36] <Sumit108> right room, I'm off, thank you for your advice, check you later on linux
[10:36] <amorphous_> could anyone offer some asvise as to a decent pdf viewer that can give me the options to fit 2 pages onto one(a4) as xubuntu's Evince doesn't seem to... I wondered id it was the printer drivers but i've tried a couple of different drivers with no difference... :(
[10:36] <aliendream23> sorry, could someone repost that how to stop x for me??
[10:36] <ReWT_AxS> i just found this
[10:36] <ReWT_AxS> Realtek ALC861 High Definition audio codec
[10:36] <Curs0r> Sumit108, good luck
[10:36] <hjmills> aliendream23: press ctrl alt and f1 to get to the term , login and use "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
[10:36] <ReWT_AxS> 3D audio compliant with AC'97 Rev. 2.3 and HD Audio compatible
[10:36] <Sumit108> now where did i leave that hammer??
[10:37] <aliendream23> thanks
[10:37] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, the fact that ATI is involved in your chipset scares me a bit too
[10:37] <BlackHawk> gn8
[10:37] <ReWT_AxS> well
[10:37] <amorphous_> anyone...???
[10:37] <ReWT_AxS> what do i do now
[10:38] <Curs0r> amorphous_, adobe reader
[10:38] <whyameye> amorphous_: I use adobe's reader.
[10:39] <Curs0r> amorphous_, funny that you'd come here and get impatient before trying an obvious option
[10:39] <amorphous_> Curs0r, fair shout. was hoping for a more 'free' app, but if thats the only way to cut my paper consumption by 50% then it's gotta be a winner, eh?
[10:39] <ReWT_AxS> o_O
[10:39] <spunk_> Q: where can I get hold of the w32codecs package?
[10:39] <amorphous_> Curs0r, sorry - truth be known I tried a few, but did't see the woods fr the trees :/
[10:39] <Curs0r> spunk_ look at the ubuntuguide
[10:39] <GlennBrit> I am trying to install 6.10 on a Gateway laptop, and the install app always locks up after displaying the language selection screen, any ideas?
[10:40] <spunk_> Curs0r, ok
[10:40] <hjmills> GlennBrit: try the alternate install if u can
[10:40] <whyameye> amorphous_: anyway I checked and Adobe reader does facing pages like you are looking for...
[10:40] <amorphous_> been getting a headache trying to get my opera mail into thunderbird on my fresh xubuntu install.
[10:40] <amorphous_> whyameye, thanks, man
[10:40] <Curs0r> amorphous_, no worries, but yeah adobe reader is probablly the most refined
[10:40] <oskude> GlennBrit: the standars, check md5sum of downloaded iso, and or try the "check cd" option at boot. to make sure the cd/image is ok...
[10:40] <GlennBrit> Every time I try to download the alternate install, I get 200mb, and the download ends
[10:40] <amorphous_> 'tis sold.
[10:40] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, what form is this driver you found taking?
[10:41] <ReWT_AxS> huh
[10:41] <amorphous_> thankyou gents (or possibly ladies(s) ;)
[10:41] <ReWT_AxS> that was just a listing abotu the audio of this tower
[10:41] <ReWT_AxS> nothign to do weith driversd
[10:41] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, ah
[10:41] <ragnar_123> Hey guys!
[10:41] <phiqtion> does anybody know why my router is taking so long to resolve a website? my modem connected directly to my pc resolves any website quickly but not the router. i already reset it but the problem persists. is my router malfunctioning? any help is appreciatted thanks.
[10:42] <nolimitsoya> phiqtion, this is an ubuntu support channel, not a random router one. contact the routers suppport hotline
[10:42] <oskude> phiqtion: i got same symptoms as my last router started to die... but there may be other reasons...
[10:43] <phiqtion> oskude: i see, thx bro.
[10:43] <herfer> how do I list which packages are insalled on a system ?
[10:43] <herfer> with apt-get ?
[10:44] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r,
[10:44] <ReWT_AxS> i found this http://www.opendrivers.com/driver/217400/realtek-alc-alc880-alc260-alc861-hd-audio-codecs-driver-r1.0-linux-free-download.html
[10:44] <nolimitsoya> herfer, dpkg -l, perhaps?
[10:44] <ReWT_AxS> think it will work?
[10:44] <ReWT_AxS> and can you help me install it
[10:44] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, is your cpu amd or intel?
[10:44] <amorphous_> hey - while I'm here.... anyone have any idea why I'm struggling to get thunderbird to recognise a renamed opera exported mbs file (to inbox in ~/.moz_thund/etc/ dir) (or anything else I rename it to it would appear)?
[10:45] <ReWT_AxS> im guessing intel...it's got a p4 processor
[10:45] <spunk_> Curs0r, hm, seems that http://packages.freecontrib.org/ is broken... (needed for w32codecs?)
[10:45] <cablesm102> If I have a list of packages from a file, such as one put out by sbackup, how can I get it to automatically go through the list and install all the packages from the repos?
[10:46] <Curs0r> spunk_, umm i have have no idea what to do about that lol
[10:46] <spunk_> Curs0r, yea, I figured that. :-)
[10:47] <ReWT_AxS> it's intel
[10:47] <ricanelite> does anyone here have a HP1400 All-in-one printer or could help me get my printer working on Ubuntu Linux Edgy???
[10:47] <cablesm102> ricanelite, have you tried the regular printer adding panel?
[10:47] <hjmills> what reason could there be for my internet suddenly going slow - other ppl hav bin using my pc but with no real linux knowledge
[10:47] <ricanelite> what you mean?
[10:48] <ricanelite> Because you see Ubuntu see the printer
[10:48] <ricanelite> and it use to print and scan
[10:48] <oskude> ricanelite: i got a hp1215, working nicely
[10:48] <narvik86> spunk_: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html codecs are also here, you can download the manually and copy into right place
[10:48] <cablesm102> ricanelite, most HP printers work right away. Have you gone to Administration>Printing>Add Printer?
[10:48] <spunk_> narvik86, nice! thanks!
[10:48] <cablesm102> ricanelite, actually it's New Printer
[10:50] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, you should be ok to try that, just make sure you read the README file very slowly twice
[10:50] <EZMAN> Hey guys how do u stop the listing of channels when u join a irc network with xchat ?
[10:51] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r, i cant find one where the d/l works?
[10:51] <EZMAN> anyone ?
[10:51] <EZMAN> cant be that hard right, must be something i overlooked
[10:51] <oskude> EZMAN: hmm, i never had that. so it should be "off" by default...
[10:51] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, http://download.opendrivers.com/drv/soundcard/realtek/linux_r101.zip
[10:52] <ReWT_AxS> did you try it
[10:52] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, yes
[10:52] <miladmovie> hello
[10:52] <kitche> EZMAN you mean the server list on that screen there is a skip network list on startup
[10:52] <Curs0r> hi
[10:52] <cablesm102> !ask
[10:52] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)

[10:53] <crowley1027> hola
[10:53] <crowley1027> how do i remove flash via terminal
[10:53] <Curs0r> well just unzip the file then find the readme in the extracted folder, it has all the info. i checked
[10:53] <miladmovie> anybody can help me to install AC 97 modem in linux
[10:53] <EZMAN> actually not network list...im talking about the channel list, when joining a larger network then this one its pretty mush spam me to hell...for example quakenet
[10:53] <crowley1027> !uninstall
[10:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uninstall - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:53] <Curs0r> miladmovie, if you get that working let me know
[10:54] <crowley1027> can someone tell me how to uninstall flash from linux
[10:54] <cablesm102> crowley1027, sudo aptitude remove flashplugin-nonfree
[10:54] <kitche> miladmovie: that is bult into linux I know the kernel has a driver for it
[10:54] <crowley1027> k
[10:54] <oskude> EZMAN: well, i dont see anywhere where xchat ask for that list, is it a "feature" of that network ?
[10:54] <PriceChild> How do i add a key on the cli
[10:54] <EZMAN> nope...its just turned on by default..might be that im using gnome xchat atm...might wanne go with the usual xchat-2
[10:54] <cablesm102> crowley1027, that will remove the package. I'm not sure it'll remove the libraries. If flash isn't removed, ask again
[10:55] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, i wouldn't get your hopes up about this driver
[10:55] <kitche> EZMAN: are you using xchat or xchat-gnome?
[10:55] <miladmovie> kitche : I have ubuntu 6.06 and it can not detect by my linux I hade acer laptop
[10:55] <hjmills> alright, own up, who broke the internet?

[10:56] <cablesm102> crowley1027, did it work?
[10:56] <hjmills> Curs0r: tut tut - really - hasnt your mother taught you anything
[10:56] <PriceChild> !language | EZMAN
[10:56] <ubotu> EZMAN: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[10:56] <crowley1027> no
[10:56] <kitche> EZMAN: I m not sure about xchat-gnome since I don't use, sicne it's not really xchat
[10:56] <dou213> hey guys, if i want to be anonymous on the web, what should i use? router?
[10:56] <EZMAN> hehe
[10:56] <Curs0r> hjmills, only how to cheat at 3 card monty
[10:56] <hjmills> crowley1027: were you playing catch with him then?
[10:56] <cablesm102> dou213, tor.
[10:56] <klick> hey all, im trying to figure out what im missing, certain sites like myspace work on firefox 2.0 on windows, but when i use them with ubuntus firefox 2.0 the song box doesnt show what song is playing, but the music is still playing and i can see all the controls.. is there a bug or something? it used to work a few months ago
[10:56] <crowley1027> .....was I?
[10:57] <EZMAN> yea know...my source list wasent updated so only version i found of xchat...but solved now np...ty all
[10:57] <cablesm102> !tor | dou213
[10:57] <crowley1027> HAHA klick thats my same problem.
[10:57] <ubotu> tor: anonymizing overlay network for TCP. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.1.1.23-1 (edgy), package size 763 kB, installed size 1556 kB
[10:57] <PriceChild> How do i add a gpg key using the cli?
[10:57] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r, so you suggest switching soundcards?
[10:57] <Curs0r> dou213, wear a nixon mask at your keyboard
[10:57] <crowley1027> i think it has something to do with flash.
[10:57] <dou213> yeah heard about tor and jap
[10:57] <klick> crowley1027, yeah its weird.. its like soo barely inconvient i dont want to spend  alot of time to fix it, but was hoping someone know what the issue was
[10:57] <dou213> thx
[10:57] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, that would be the best thing,alc chips are garbage
[10:57] <ReWT_AxS> k
[10:57] <klick> crowley1027, i think it might have to do with flash v9
[10:58] <crowley1027> click is viewing a flash media player but not all of the functions are showing up.  The main background picture is gone but the volume bar, seeker knob, general buttons, and tha twill work
[10:58] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, you can try that driver, i don't think it will hurt anything if it fails
[10:58] <Flannel> !gpg | PriceChild
[10:58] <ubotu> PriceChild: gpg is the GNU Privacy Guard.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto
[10:58] <ReWT_AxS> it wont even configure
[10:58] <hjmills> but seriously - what could be wrong with my internet - pages take an age to load but irc works fine - dns seems ok but it shows the same prob with web browsing on 2 pcs and on both firefox and elinks
[10:58] <klick> crowley1027, yeah exactly..
[10:58] <Curs0r> yeah not surprising
[10:58] <PriceChild> that would have been clever thanks Flannel
[10:58] <kitche> !ipv6|hjmills
[10:58] <ubotu> hjmills: To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[10:59] <cablesm102> crowley1027, you have to delete the library
[10:59] <klick> ubotu help me!
[10:59] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, have you tried setting up the alsa driver with snd-hda-intel or whatever that driver was?
[10:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about help me! - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:59] <kitche> hjmills: if you didn't disable ipv6 that is most likely your problem
[10:59] <klick> ubotu flash

[10:59] <ReWT_AxS> ?
[10:59] <ReWT_AxS> i dunno how
[10:59] <hjmills> kitche: if a webpage is loaded it seems to work fine - that came up fast!
[10:59] <cablesm102> crowley1027, try this: rm ~/.mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[11:00] <PriceChild> Flannel: that didn't answer my question
[11:00] <kitche> hjmills: just try the disable ipv6 and see if that works it usually does for most people at least
[11:00] <klick> cablesm102, wont that just get rid of flash all together?
[11:00] <PriceChild> Flannel: sudo apt-key add <<name of key>>.gpg - would that do it?
[11:00] <ronin3> hjmills, for me, putting a line that says only "search" before my "nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" lines in /etc/resolv.conf makes a HUGE difference for some reason that I don't understand.
[11:00] <cablesm102> I thought that's what crowley1027 wanted?

[11:01] <Flannel> PriceChild: err... what?  Oh, you want to add a GPG key for repository stuff?
[11:01] <cablesm102> crowley1027, are you trying to install Flash 9 beta?
[11:01] <PriceChild> Flannel: indeedy :)
[11:01] <Flannel> PriceChild: see, now that's a different question ;)
[11:01] <klick> i think thats what were trying to do cablesm102
[11:01] <klick> do you have a good link on it?
[11:01] <cablesm102> klick, it's easy
[11:01] <PriceChild> Flannel: ah i suppose sorry :)
[11:01] <cablesm102> you download the library and you put it in the plugins folder
[11:01] <cablesm102> hold on, i'll get some more info
[11:02] <Flannel> PriceChild: there's a little mini Howto thing at the top of this page : http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
[11:02] <kitche> klick there is also a package for flash9
[11:02] <kitche> !flash9|klick
[11:02] <ubotu> klick: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[11:02] <cablesm102> there is?
[11:02] <Flannel> cablesm102: yeah.  What do you think this is gentoo?
[11:02] <cablesm102> Flannel, it worked for me.
[11:02] <hjmills> kitche: i have tried it on a win xp machine and that shows the same symptoms though it gets dhcp info from an ubuntu machine so wld that throw it?
[11:03] <Chris_Lavoie> I need some help.... I can't resize my NTFS Partiton
[11:03] <Flannel> cablesm102: of course it works.  But, your flash isn't in package management, which means when you a) upgrade, b) need to fix bugs c)...um, whatever.  You'll need to handle it by hand.
[11:03] <klick> kitche, do you know what the package name is called?
[11:03] <Curs0r> so i'm guessing that driver has been changed to snd-hda-codec from what i'm reading
[11:03] <kitche> hjmills: or the search in /etc/resolv.conf might do it also since I know if you have a search in /etc/resolv.conf it will search in that "domain" first before it looks out
[11:03] <Chris_Lavoie> yea\
[11:03] <cablesm102> Flannel, good point.

[11:04] <HoORnet> hi, i want open many ports for outbount traffic, but just for one service, is it possible with Firestarter ?
[11:04] <ronin3> hjmills, for me, putting a line that says only "search" before my "nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" lines in /etc/resolv.conf makes a HUGE difference for some reason that I don't understand.
[11:04] <cablesm102> Flannel, would downloading it from packages.ubuntu.com work or should I enable backports?
[11:04] <muszek> hi... I'm filing a bug at launchpad and want to provide some info about my hard drive (/dev/sda) and motherboard... could someone please tell me which command(s) would output needed information?
[11:04] <Chris_Lavoie> Hello??
[11:04] <Rappermas> hey guys, i'm having trouble installing the binary nvidia drivers--i've done this before, but this is a fresh installation of ubuntu and the nvidia installer is giving me: ERROR: Unable to determine the NVIDIA kernel module filename.  Help?
[11:04] <hjmills> ronin3: thanks
[11:04] <Flannel> cablesm102: either way works.  The latter will update it when it gets updated in backports (bugfixes), but the former is a big increase from installing from source
[11:05] <ronin3> hjmills: did that fix the problem?
[11:05] <A-L-A-R-M> which is a good tv application for a tv-card ? expect xawtv
[11:05] <Rappermas> i'm not sure, but maybe it has something do with the kernel source or the xorg headers
[11:05] <vorbote> muszek: "dmesg | less"
[11:05] <cablesm102> Flannel, I didn't install from source. I downloaded the installer from Adobe, unzipped, pulled libflashplayer.so out of it and stuck it in plugins. Still bad form, though.
[11:05] <hjmills> ronin3: just tryin.....no unfortunatly not
[11:05] <kitche> klick: yes but you need edgy-backports enabled
[11:05] <muszek> vorbote, thanks
[11:05] <PriceChild> Flannel: yeah but I have a key already which i want to add
[11:05] <Flannel> cablesm102: that's essentially installing from source, only without the compiling (and without the source, I suppose)
[11:05] <Rappermas> unless all of you guys have ATi cards :)
[11:05] <PriceChild> do i just replace the "-" with the name of hte file?
[11:06] <kitche> Rappermas: why not install the ubuntu binary package?
[11:06] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, bingo:http://osdir.com/ml/alsa-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg18155.html
[11:06] <Rappermas> AIGLX kitche
[11:06] <klick> kitche, ohh cool that seemed to fix it
[11:06] <cablesm102> Rappermas, have you checked https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia?highlight=%28Nvidia%29
[11:06] <klick> thanks bro
[11:06] <kitche> !nvidia9|Rappermas
[11:06] <ubotu> Rappermas: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using this repository: deb http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/ubuntu edgy stable
=== mikebo1 is now known as mikebot
[11:06] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, looks like an easy fix too
[11:06] <Flannel> PriceChild: yeah, that - recieves the piped output of the export command
[11:06] <kitche> Rappermas: and with nvidia9 drivers you don't even use AIGLX
[11:06] <Rappermas> ok, thanks guys, i'll check this out
[11:07] <Rappermas> kitche: not sure i understand what you just said
[11:07] <cablesm102> Rappermas, are you trying to install the Nvidia beta or the stable?
[11:07] <Rappermas> beta
[11:07] <PriceChild> Flannel: thanks, that's all i need :)
[11:07] <adam1001> hi all, I'm having problems with my upgrade to Edgy. After upgrading x was completely screwed and wouldn't start (I fixed that by reconfiguring and loading, using the vesa driver), but now there is no wireless networking (my desktop is in a different room from the cable modem)...the networking works fine, however, if I load the live cd...any suggestions?
[11:07] <cablesm102> Rappermas, the Nvidia beta driver provides the AIGLX features, if I'm not mistaken.
[11:07] <Rappermas> yes, it does, cablesm102
[11:07] <kitche> Rappermas cablesm102: the stable nvidia driver does
[11:08] <Curs0r> cablesm102, i'm running the 88xx driver and it's fine with aiglx
[11:08] <Rappermas> the stable provides AIGLX functionality too?
[11:08] <cablesm102> No.
[11:08] <Rappermas> when did this happen?
[11:08] <ReWT_AxS> that's a mailto link?
[11:08] <Rappermas> oh lol
[11:08] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r, ^
[11:08] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, http://osdir.com/ml/alsa-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg18155.html
[11:08] <kitche> Rappermas cablesm102: yes the 9xxx series does the AIGLX support
[11:08] <Rappermas> i've set up about 3 machines so far with beta nvidia drivers, but i keep forgetting what to do each time
[11:08] <cablesm102> kitche, yes, but that's the beta.
[11:09] <cablesm102> kitche, someone said that the stable did
[11:09] <cablesm102> i'm correcting them
[11:09] <Chris_Lavoie> Ok, I need to resize my NTFS Partition and Gparted is giving me the "Can't perform Operation" error when I try to shrink it down, Any Ideas on how to shrink it, without uninstalling WinXP??
[11:09] <Rappermas> the stable doesn't
[11:09] <kitche> cablesm102, umm 9xxx is the latest stable driver from nvidia
[11:09] <Curs0r> cablesm102, i'm running the stable right now with aiglx
[11:09] <wasp_ems> hi i am having problems in sending files through my network on another computer...i am writing them straight to another pc through my network but it is taking ages...any help
[11:09] <JasonHeller> If I install ubuntu on my computer, will my family still be able to use windows easlily?
[11:09] <vorbote> adam1001: if you installed using the alternate cd, make sure to install the kernel restricted modules package (use synaptic, read from the cd).
[11:09] <Rappermas> ok, brb, i'm gonna read this
[11:09] <wasp_ems> and i get timeout reached
[11:10] <Flannel> JasonHeller: yeah.  When they boot, it'll prompt them (you can set it to boot windows by default, so they don't have to know about it)
[11:10] <vorbote> Chris_Lavoie, run defrag in windows at least twice :-)
[11:10] <adam1001> i upgraded using the package manager (as per official instructions)
[11:10] <kitche> cablesm102, Rappermas: the latest stable nvidia driver is Latest Version: 1.0-9631unless you mean ubuntu stable
[11:10] <JasonHeller> cool thanks
[11:10] <Chris_Lavoie> Sweet
[11:10] <Chris_Lavoie> I'll try that
[11:10] <Rappermas> i haven't checked--i always use beta drivers
[11:10] <Rappermas> they're perfectly fine and never crash
[11:10] <cablesm102> kitche, you're right, I meant Ubuntu stable. BTW, do you know when 9xxx is coming out on the Ubuntu repos?
[11:10] <hanso> hey! anyone knows about a good web site developer like dreamweaver or frontpage???
[11:10] <kitche> cablesm102, next release probably
[11:11] <cablesm102> kitche, Feisty?
[11:11] <hjmills> identify barnaby
[11:11] <vorbote> adam1001: Then make sure that it is loading the firmware for your wireless (broadcom thingies are particularly nasty). Can't help you there, but there are plenty of how-tos at ubuntuforums.
[11:11] <wasp_ems> plus the bug reporting tool comes out

[11:11] <GreenD> soo
[11:11] <cablesm102> Openoffice does it, but I'm sure Nvu is much better

[11:12] <cablesm102> GreenD, go to Applications>Accessories>Terminal
[11:12] <ronin3> hjmills: glad it's working now!
[11:12] <doug_h> then you can run rm -rf
[11:12] <Flannel> GreenD: and, don't enter that command.
[11:12] <ReWT_AxS> err Curs0r it says to add a line to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
[11:12] <GreenD> THANKS!
[11:12] <ReWT_AxS> but i dont have that file?
[11:12] <cablesm102> GreenD, that's not a good idea
[11:12] <doug_h> too late note
[11:13] <cablesm102> shit
[11:13] <adam1001> ok...i'm wondering if it would be better then to do a fresh install from the cd (my /home is on another drive, so it should be safe)
[11:13] <cablesm102> i mean, shoot
[11:13] <doug_h> now* greend already ran it probably

[11:13] <doug_h> nah he's probably running it in vmware
[11:13] <cablesm102> his leet friend = an assh*le
[11:14] <cablesm102> if he knew how to use vmware, he'd know where to find the terminal
[11:14] <Rappermas> ok just so you guys know, i just tried the stable drivers and it worked
[11:14] <doug_h> nah you can use vmware with no knowledge of unix
[11:14] <WalrusKing> Hey
[11:14] <Rappermas> apparently, the latest betas are messed up
[11:14] <WalrusKing> Who here made my friend rm -rf???
[11:14] <kitche> Rappermas what card do you have?
[11:14] <Rappermas> nVIDIA Quadro FX 4500
[11:14] <cablesm102> dough_h, but Applications>Accessories>Terminal is pretty easy to find
[11:15] <Rappermas> it's a nice card, if i do say so myself
[11:15] <doug_h> eh
[11:15] <Larus> does anyone know how to get sound working on a 6.10 install? I think it might be my sound card, it's a Sigmatel (generic)
[11:15] <doug_h> never know
[11:15] <Rappermas> it's for the blender stuff i'm doing for game dev
[11:15] <cablesm102> Larus, sigmatel works great for me
[11:15] <Larus> sorry.. it works under ubuntu but for some reason it's not working with Wine
[11:15] <doug_h> i've got ubuntu dapper drake running on a sigmatel C sharp integrated sound on my Dell Inspiron 700m
[11:15] <Larus> the apps I installed have no sound
[11:15] <Curs0r> ReWT_AxS, you're running edgy?
[11:16] <Rappermas> yeah, but thanks though, i would've never thought to try the stables
[11:16] <Groovebot> hey, guys
[11:16] <cablesm102> Larus, that's a wine problem
[11:16] <cablesm102> Should Larus try aoss?
[11:16] <kitche> Larus, does the apps output any errors?
[11:16] <Rappermas> anyway, just so everyone knows, beta nvidia drivers aren't installable as of right now
[11:16] <Groovebot> how do I get this nvidia card to use hw acceleration on ubuntu?
[11:16] <ReWT_AxS> Curs0r, yes
[11:16] <cablesm102> Larus, try this: sudo aptitude install alsa-oss
[11:16] <Larus> lol, figured right when I joined here
[11:16] <Larus> no errors
[11:16] <Larus> just no sound
[11:16] <Rappermas> thanks,  and later guys

[11:28] <vanberge> Curs0r, i know... i actually got some good thermal gel and re applied my heatsink
[11:28] <bruenig> A-L-A-R-M, you can use widgets, or you can use a panel applet
[11:28] <vanberge> it just cant handle my processor.  :-(
[11:28] <vanberge> i have a new one i am going to put in tonight
[11:28] <boOkwo7m> i have a silly irc-etiquette question :)
[11:28] <Farm_Fresh> Ok, well I've just finished installing 6.1 beta (on CD I have)  now what?
[11:28] <Curs0r> !ask boOkwo7m
[11:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ask boOkwo7m - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:28] <vanberge> vorbote, thanks for the info... definitely good to know
[11:29] <bruenig> Farm_Fresh, why would you install 6.1 beta, the final is out

[11:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ask laptop fans - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:29] <boOkwo7m> is it in the norm to have a nick with with non-alpha chars in it?  (e.g. digits, as in my nick)
[11:29] <A-L-A-R-M> okie
[11:29] <un_operateur1> !ask | boOkwo7m
[11:29] <ubotu> boOkwo7m: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:29] <stapel> it just hangs there...and then I have to ctl-C to get out
[11:29] <bruenig> boOkwo7m, they are a bit annoying to retype, but with tab completion it is rarely an issue. Some do and some don't.
[11:29] <boOkwo7m> ubotu: bleh
[11:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bleh - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[11:29] <un_operateur1> boOkwo7m, there's nothing wrong with that -- although it may frsutrate users with older IRC clients that dont have tab complete
[11:30] <LinTux> How do I install NDWrapper in terminal
[11:30] <JasonHeller> I installed ubuntu but when I try to boot windows I get a disc read error.  What do I do?
[11:30] <maxxism> stapel no idea.  sorry
[11:30] <un_operateur1> it also makes your name a slight bit unreadable
[11:30] <vanberge> LinTux, you mean ndiswrapper?
[11:30] <un_operateur1> so, its best avoided
[11:30] <Farm_Fresh> bruenig:  It's the only CD I have.. And I can't burn another.. No burner.
[11:30] <bruenig> Farm_Fresh, ah
[11:30] <LinTux> how do I install NDisWrapper complete in terminal
[11:30] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, make sure your windows partition is set correctly in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[11:30] <vanberge> LinTux, apt-get install ndiswrapper
[11:30] <LinTux> cheers
[11:31] <boOkwo7m> bruenig, un_operateur1:  k thanks.  I'll change 'em :)
[11:31] <vanberge> LinTux, you have to enable universe/multiverse first though
[11:31] <JasonHeller> Curs0r how do I do that?
[11:31] <Farm_Fresh> bruenig:  So, whats next?
[11:31] <bruenig> Farm_Fresh, what is the question
[11:31] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[11:31] <stapel> if I uninstall Tomboy and then re-install it again, will I lose my notes?
[11:32] <LinTux> vanberge, I tried that and got this error - E: Couldn't find package ndiswrapper
[11:32] <Farm_Fresh> bruenig:  I just installed 6.1 beta.  what do I need to do to bring it current?
[11:32] <bh__> Hello
[11:32] <ady> stapel, i think so
[11:32] <hjmills> stapel: theoretically i would say no unless you use purge but dnt quote me
[11:32] <bh__> I'm having a lot of problems with the installer for 6.10
[11:32] <un_operateur1> stapel, you shouldnt unless you purge tomboy
[11:32] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, since this is your first time, i cannot strees enough: do NOT screw with your working partition, stick to fiddling with the windows entry for now
[11:32] <bruenig> Farm_Fresh, there should have been and update manager pop up. To make sure, do "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"
[11:32] <bruenig> s/and/an
[11:33] <bh__> this is an older Pentiun M machine and the kernel doesn't seem to want to either decompress or some other problem early in the load phase
[11:33] <JasonHeller> Curs0r, I have menu.lst opened, but I don't know what to do next.
[11:33] <hjmills> !beagle
[11:33] <ubotu> beagle: indexing and search tool for your personal data. In component main, is optional. Version 0.2.9-1ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 804 kB, installed size 3160 kB
[11:33] <Desert88> hey
[11:33] <ubek_> hi
[11:33] <ady> is there  a way to install directx on Ubuntu?
[11:33] <hjmills> is beagle any good?
[11:33] <hjmills> ady nio
[11:33] <Desert88> is there a way to get flash 9 on ubuntu?
[11:33] <Curs0r> JasonHeller,  well is there an entry that says windows in that file?
[11:33] <hjmills> ady: no
[11:33] <bh__> I've also tried a number of acpi/apic options with no luck. It seems to be earlier than bus detection
[11:33] <Desert88> or are we doomed to suffer
[11:33] <JasonHeller> yes
[11:33] <Curs0r> ok
[11:33] <hjmills> Desert88: yup - go to the adobe website
[11:33] <Desert88> i did
[11:33] <Masaka> hjmills: beagle uses mono :(
[11:33] <Desert88> and it just installs flash 7
[11:33] <esaym> whats up yall
[11:34] <kitche> Desert88, it's also in edgy-backports
[11:34] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, the like where it says root(hdx,x) is what we need to look at
[11:34] <esaym> can anyone give me the contents of /etc/init.d/displayconfig-hwprobe.py ??
[11:34] <Desert88> im on dapper
[11:34] <hjmills> Desert88: i found flash 9 on there i think earlier today
[11:34] <Curs0r> line*
[11:34] <vorbote> bh__: try booting with "nosmp noapic nolapic"
[11:34] <un_operateur1> beagle is like the google desktop search -- always keeping a tab on what you store -- it's pretty helpful and quite a few applications depend on it
[11:34] <hjmills> Desert88: any particular reason not to upgrade?
[11:34] <mefisto> hi all
[11:34] <mefisto> i have problem
[11:34] <Desert88> no not really
[11:34] <Masaka> hjmills: I would recommend tracker instead
[11:34] <JasonHeller> Curs0r, it says for windows hd0, 0
[11:34] <dampyle> how do you upgrade warty I tried apt-get upgrade was a no go
[11:34] <hjmills> un_operateur1: any better than locate?
[11:34] <Desert88> whats the easiest way to upgrade
[11:34] <bh__> vorbote, using the "live" option ?
[11:34] <Desert88> im new to ubuntu
[11:34] <Desert88> had it about 4 days
[11:34] <ubek_> people i've serious problem with sound card on laptop pleace little help!!
[11:34] <LinTux> Can anyone tell me the correct command to indtsll ndwrapper in terminal
[11:34] <mefisto> how can i launch pg_ctrl on ubuntu
[11:34] <hjmills> Masaka: whats tracker and why is it betteR?
[11:34] <mefisto> ?
[11:34] <un_operateur1> hjmills, what do you want to locate??
[11:34] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, which drive and partition is windows on?
[11:34] <Desert88> so i just recently upgraded to dapper
[11:34] <stapel> in synaptic, what is the difference between "removal" and "complete removal"
[11:35] <un_operateur1> hjmills, files or content within files
[11:35] <vorbote> bh__: yes, you can pass parameters to the kernel (use F6)
[11:35] <un_operateur1> ?
[11:35] <Desert88> but adobe will install flash 9 on edgy?
[11:35] <hjmills> un_operateur1: normally i want to look for files where i know part of the path or the programs its linked to
[11:35] <JasonHeller> I don't know
[11:35] <Farm_Fresh> bruenig:  Ok.. it gave me a pretty big list of things to be upgraded.. And a pretty good list, of things to be kept back.. Why?
[11:35] <un_operateur1> stapel, one removes the package, another removes the package and all its configuration files
[11:35] <JasonHeller> I only have one drive
[11:35] <chable> anyone knows why azureus wont open ?
[11:35] <bh__> vorbote, ok, I'm going to try it
[11:35] <chable> wont start
[11:35] <un_operateur1> hjmills, you could use locate for that
[11:35] <mefisto> how can i launch pg_ctrl on ubuntu ?
[11:35] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, (hd0,0) means that it wants to look for windows on the first partition of the first drive
[11:36] <stapel> un_operateur1: thanx
[11:36] <un_operateur1> hjmills, in the command line -- locate filename
[11:36] <JasonHeller> so why do I get a disc read error?
[11:36] <Masaka> hjmills: (meta) tracker is a search daemon, it's faster, w/o mono and an xdg spec --> http://www.gnome.org/~jamiemcc/tracker/
[11:36] <bruenig> Farm_Fresh, having not been in your situation, I am not certain. Since you just installed, I would just go with all the upgrades and then figure it out from there. You can always reinstall right?
[11:36] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, you only have one drive?
[11:36] <mefisto> how can i launch pg_ctrl on ubuntu ?
[11:36] <JasonHeller> yeah
[11:36] <bh__> vorbote, same problem
[11:36] <un_operateur1> hjmills, if you know part of the filename -- locate | grep -i string
[11:36] <Desert88> hey if i have beryl installed will it still work fine if i upgrade to edgy?
[11:36] <II`et|Weirdo> maybe silly question but what kind of CD image do i have to burn, running intel pentium D 3.2ghz the 32 bit or the 64 bit when i boot i see EM64T (extended memory 64 bit)
[11:36] <Honda> is there a way to retrieve what username and password I used for my ubuntu login?
[11:36] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, did you repartition to install linux?
[11:36] <ReiserFreak> how can i make my tv a different display? (it is in clone modus right now and i am using edgy and fglrx)
[11:36] <JasonHeller> It did it for me
[11:37] <bruenig> II`et|Weirdo, 32 bit
[11:37] <bh__> vorbote, still hangs
[11:37] <Farm_Fresh> bruenig:  Yeah, thats what I just did.
[11:37] <mefisto> how can i launch pg_ctrl on ubuntu ?
[11:37] <II`et|Weirdo> k tnx bruenig
[11:37] <hjmills> ReiserFreak: yes but please tell me how to clone it first! im trying to do that!!!
[11:37] <Desert88> hey anyone know if my beryl will still work fine if i upgrade to edgy
[11:37] <Desert88> it took me forever to install
[11:37] <bh__> vorbote, any other suggestions ?
[11:37] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, i think your windows is probably toast, is there a hard drive icon on your desktop?
[11:37] <mefisto> how can i launch pg_ctrl on ubuntu ?
[11:37] <un_operateur1> Desert88, there is no guarantee -- but hopefully it will
[11:37] <JasonHeller> no
[11:37] <vorbote> bh__: Hmm... That sounds like either you may not have enough RAM to fit the kernel in memory, or the CD wasn't burnt correctly.
[11:37] <bh__> vorbote, I don't think the kernel even gets to the point where it's loading
[11:38] <un_operateur1> usually during an upgrade, older packages are replaced -- and this process can break functionality
[11:38] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, ok try this for me, open a terminal and type sudo /bin/bash
[11:38] <bh__> vorbote, I reburned the CD and I have about 768M of RAM
[11:38] <ReiserFreak> hjmills: ok no problem mate: i plug in the cable into my vga and restart x while tv it turned on and set to AV!
[11:38] <drivera90> In Xchat, what should I separate channel names with? ; or ,?
[11:38] <gpd> any reason why the generic kernel freezes on boot of my AMD64?
[11:38] <ReiserFreak> hjmills: X recognizes it automatically
[11:38] <hjmills> ReiserFreak: oh - lucky
[11:38] <vorbote> bh__: if it even starts loading then probably the kernel is corrupt on disk (try burning a new copy at 4x)
[11:38] <hjmills> ReiserFreak: it ddnt do colour for me
[11:38] <boglizk> Whats 32mb in kbytes?
[11:38] <ReiserFreak> hjmills: not at all or not in clone mode?
[11:39] <unix_infidel> 32MBx(1024KB/1MB)=(n)KB
[11:39] <JasonHeller> now it says root@jason-desktop: ~#
[11:39] <vorbote> bh__: and if you are using a cd-rw make sure to do a full blank before writing the image on it.
[11:39] <un_operateur1> 32Mib would be 32768 KiB
[11:39] <boglizk> thanks
[11:39] <un_operateur1> MiB*
[11:39] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, is your hard drive ide or sata?
[11:39] <hjmills> ReiserFreak: when i dont configure it at all
[11:39] <mc44> drivera90: ,
[11:39] <JasonHeller> i don't know
[11:39] <un_operateur1> however 32MB would be 32000 KB
[11:39] <hjmills> ReiserFreak: http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_TV-Out
[11:39] <Curs0r> then try this first fdisk /dev/hda
[11:39] <larry> dumb question alert.. I can't browse the AudioCD i just put in, but I can "play" it.
[11:40] <larry> Is it the CD?
[11:40] <bh__> vorbote, interesting, I'm using k3b
[11:40] <JasonHeller> it said unable to open
[11:40] <bh__> vorbote, the burn was reported as being a success
[11:40] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, ok, no problem fdisk /dev/sda
[11:40] <tony22> can anyone help w a sed command.. trying to replace " " with " \" but i get : "sed: -e expression #1, char 8: unterminated `s' command"
[11:40] <un_operateur1> tony, escape the \
[11:40] <JasonHeller> a bunch of stuff popped up
[11:41] <bh__> vorbote, k3b auto-blanked it
[11:41] <edgarin> Hello, excuseme howto i can burn a file .avi in k3b vcd
[11:41] <edgarin> ?
[11:41] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, now enter "p" w/o the quotes to display your partition table
[11:41] <JasonHeller> it says the number of cylinder is set to 30401
[11:41] <vorbote> bh__: To be really sure you should run sha1sum on both the image file and the /dev/hdx that corresponds to your finalized CD.
[11:41] <tony22> un_operateur1, this is my line now: sed -e s/\ /\ \\/g
[11:41] <JasonHeller> ok hold on
[11:41] <bh__> ok
[11:41] <bh__> vorbote, I'll try that
[11:41] <JasonHeller> k now what
[11:41] <bh__> vorbote, now as a matter of fact
[11:41] <vorbote> bh__: I much rather do the blanking my hand using cdrecod/wodim from a termina,.
[11:41] <drivera90> In XChat, under "Channels to join", I put a list of three channels separated by commas, but it only joins the first one.
[11:41] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, any of those partitions claim to be Fat32 or HPFS.NTFS?
[11:42] <bruenig> drivera90, you put spaces in between?
[11:42] <Shadow_mil> I wanna know if I can capture video out and use it as video in (like a web cam)
[11:42] <drivera90> Yeah bruenig
[11:42] <un_operateur1> tony22,  echo "this is a file" | sed -e 's/\ /\ \\/g'   :  this \is \a \file
[11:42] <JasonHeller> yeah the first one is HPFS.NTFS
[11:42] <bruenig> drivera90, /join #schat
[11:42] <bruenig> drivera90, /join #xchat
[11:42] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, that is hd0,0 then
[11:42] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, type q to quit that
[11:42] <bh__> vorbote, summing the data now
[11:43] <larry> ok this is wiered.. It opens Sound Juicer even though I changed it over to Grip in the "Removeable Drives and Media" control panel.
[11:43] <JasonHeller> it also says partition 2 does not end on cylinder boundary
[11:43] <tony22> un_operateur1, so i needed the " ' " ?
[11:43] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, not a huge deal
=== Masaka is now known as gozaru
[11:43] <chable> azureus starts and dies in 1 second
[11:43] <JasonHeller> k, i typed q
[11:43] <chable> anyone knows how to solve this issue ?
[11:44] <dampyle> new to ubuntu, is the kernelpath still /usr/src?
[11:44] <un_operateur1> tony -- yea, you need to put the s/// expression inside single quotes to make it safer
[11:44] <un_operateur1> larry, audio CDs dont really have directories and files you can browse normally eh, i hope you know that
[11:44] <Eclypse> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=320629
[11:44] <Curs0r> JasonHeller,  ok, for some reason your windows boot loader isn't working properly ubuntu is doing what it knows how to do
[11:45] <JasonHeller> so can i fix it?
[11:45] <larry> un_uperatur1: hmm.. must be used to that behaviour from "other os's" then..
[11:45] <Curs0r> JasonHeller, you are able to boot into ubuntu though, right?
[11:45] <dts> is there a way to purge the usb system?
[11:45] <JasonHeller> yeah
[11:45] <dts> without restarting
[11:45] <drkm> what do I apt-get to install X Libraries?
[11:45] <Curs0r> ok, you need to boot from your windows cd and get into the recovery console

[11:57] <grimace> uh, [my edgy box port 631]  that is
[11:57] <un_operateur1> Eridescent, it's one of the install modes
[11:57] <bimberi> Eridescent: you want either the server CD or the alternate CD
[11:57] <grimace> but when the printer wizard finishes, it just says "This printer couldn't be installed la la la contact your administrator"
[11:58] <bimberi> un_operateur1: Desktop CD can only install a Desktop
[11:58] <slacktyro> i installed the kde, now how can i set it up as default?
[11:58] <grimace> I thought I could do it with just win98, cups and IPP, but do I need to add samba to the mix?
[11:58] <Eridescent> where is the server CD?
[11:58] <Eridescent> im on the server page
[11:58] <Eridescent> i go to download
[11:58] <Curs0r> grimace, kind of a windows 98 question don't you think?
[11:58] <Eridescent> and it starts downloading the desktop iso
[11:59] <Voltzz> why do my network tools not work? I ping something, 100% loss, and everything else takes an insane time to do whatever its doing but does nothing, and I can't stop it =|
[11:59] <toratora> F1
[11:59] <toratora> F1 please
[11:59] <bimberi> Eridescent: http://releases.ubuntu.com/edgy/ (for example)
=== toratora is now known as progesterone
[11:59] <Curs0r> grimace, but yeah to share with 9x you probably need to include samba
[11:59] <slacktyro> anyone can tell me how to set kde as default instead gnome?
[12:00] <Curs0r> slacktyro, Kubuntu
[12:00] <Eridescent> ahhh
[12:00] <Eridescent> thank your bimberi
[12:00] <Eridescent> you*
[12:00] <grimace> curs0r: thanks - I was reaching that impression - and that makes it more of an ubuntu question again ;)
[12:00] <Eridescent> :D
[12:00] <bimberi> slacktyro: choose it from the sessions menu at the login screen and say yes when it asks if you want it to be the default
[12:00] <bimberi> Eridescent: np :)
[12:00] <slacktyro> ok ty
[12:00] <skiab0x> guys I have a problem
[12:00] <Curs0r> grimace, i'm having trouble with samba personally, good luck
[12:01] <progesterone> can i get some advice for troubleshooting?
