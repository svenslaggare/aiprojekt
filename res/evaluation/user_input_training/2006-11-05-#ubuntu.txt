[12:00] <xSUSHi> georgeb: thanks a lot i'll just boot from the live cd
[12:00] <BAzfH_> but i got internet on my f*cking station
[12:01] <BAzfH_> mcphail: well thats one opinion, mine is another
[12:01] <mcphail> true
[12:01] <BAzfH_> but yes you are right
[12:01] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: So while I am in windows I would burn all the needed DEBs on a CDRW and then, once in linux, use em off the CD... thats what i plan at least...
[12:02] <Yggdrasil> is the only way to get a 2.6.17 kernel under dapper to compile it ?
[12:02] <xSUSHi> georgeb: actually i will check out that gparted live cd -- on a business card cdrom
[12:02] <bluenova> Hello, could someone tell me the location of the xorg logs. thanks
[12:03] <andyb> sethk: Just tried to join #python and got "python :You need to be identified to join that channel". Any suggestions? I know this isn't really the place to ask but I'm new to IRC.
[12:03] <georgeb> bluenova: /var/log/; ie: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[12:03] <Acc\Deny> bluenova: locate log
[12:03] <bluenova> thanks
[12:03] <Bensin> I have a problem with upgrading Xubuntu 6.06 to 6.10 using the upgrade manager and need advice as to weather I should file a bug on this or not.
[12:03] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, you can search for packages for your Ubuntu version at packages.ubuntu.com, and download them directly from there. However, that won't download any /dependencies/ those packages may require in turn...
[12:03] <Acc\Deny>  oh well :)
[12:03] <jughead> does ubuntu 6.10 support WPA "out of the box?"
[12:03] <jordan> Yggdrasil: You might be fine grabbing it from the edgy repo, I don't see why it wouldn't work, but I am not positive it would either
[12:03] <Yggdrasil> hmm..
[12:03] <georgeb> bluenova: ls -lt /var/log/Xorg* shold sort the Xorg logs based on date; the first being the newest
[12:04] <BAzfH_> hmm.
[12:04] <Yggdrasil> jordan how would i go about doing that ?
[12:04] <Yggdrasil> is edgy the new ubuntu ?
[12:04] <borfast> jughead: yes, it does. you may run into problems, as is happening to me, though
[12:04] <BAzfH_> Yggdrasil: add edgy repos to your sources.list and install the image ;)
[12:04] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: ok. I hope those pages at least LIST the dependencies some where!
[12:04] <xSUSHi> Anyone heard about NTFS-3G?  Safe read/write access to NTFS filesystems
[12:04] <avagant> andy i don't know...
[12:04] <andyb> Yggdrasil: yes
[12:04] <avagant> you might have to register your sn.
[12:04] <Yggdrasil> ok i will
[12:04] <BAzfH_> (if you are brave)
[12:04] <borfast> Yggdrasil: yes, Edgy Eft is Ubuntu 6.10, the latest release
[12:04] <sethk> xSUSHi, sure, we've heard of it.  It's a bit new, for my taste.  depends on how much risk you want to take.
[12:05] <Yggdrasil> so just change everything that says dapper to edgy right
[12:05] <david> hey, does anyone know how to solve the problem that the bcm43xx driver cannot find bcm43xx_microcode5.fw on Dapper Drake?
[12:05] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: http://packages.debian.org/testing/x11/915resolution   lists em I guess?
[12:05] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, fortunately, yes: in the "related packages" section. However, some of them you will already have, and wouldn't need to download.
[12:05] <avagant> andyb: try /msg nickserv register password email
[12:06] <borfast> does anyone kow of a simple fix for Edgy + IPW220 + WPA2? In Dapper I installed Network Manager and it was working perfectly but now with Edgy (fresh install) I don't have the WPA2 option, only WPA :(
[12:06] <avagant> and in place of password email put what you want to use for each.
[12:06] <jordan> Yggdrasil: But make SURE you change them back when you are done.
[12:06] <avagant> in some rooms you have to be registered to enter, or some funny little thing.
[12:06] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, yes, but you should use packages.ubuntu.com: there can sometimes be incompatibilities, especially depending on what versions of Debian/Ubuntu are involved.
[12:06] <Jasey> hello, id like to know how one goes about changing the font face and size in gtk 1 apps? thanks in advance.
[12:06] <Yggdrasil> jordan huh ? cant i just run edgy ?
[12:06] <andyb> avagant: Thanks anyway. BTW - I think I'm missing some of your comments - there's too much in this channel to keep up. xchat highlights the message if you prefix it with andyb: which helps
[12:06] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: thankfully http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/x11/915resolution  lists em too :)
[12:07] <andyb> avagant: Thanks - I'll try that
[12:07] <Abnerian> Hey
[12:07] <borfast> ok, forget that, it's working after all :D
[12:07] <avagant> andyb: Yah that's what I've been trying to do, it's just alot of keystrikes I'm not use to. haha
[12:07] <zmattor> Can anyone help me get 3D acceleration working with an ati card?
[12:07] <Abnerian> Every time I switch my resolution to 1200x800, my screen gets weird lines on  it
[12:07] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, ignore the libc requirement. You may want vbetool, though.
[12:07] <jordan> Yggdrasil: Yes, if you want to upgrade to edgy, don't do anything to your sources.list and just run: gksu "update-manager -c"
[12:08] <avagant> I'm using gaim, but I might just get conversation.
[12:08] <Abnerian> Why is this and how can I fix it?
[12:08] <avagant> konversation
[12:08] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, which in turn requires pciutils.
[12:08] <gleesond> for some reasion nautilus wont let me view as a list?
[12:08] <Yggdrasil> jordan, this is a console only box
[12:08] <avagant> spread a little kde love.
[12:08] <xSUSHi> does anyone else enjoy getting really drunk and messing with linux?
[12:08] <avagant> plus they have now playing media scripts.
[12:08] <gleesond> ever since I upgraded to edgy
[12:08] <Yggdrasil> ill change the sources and update and do a dist-upgrade
[12:08] <andyb> avagant: Which IRC client are you using. I'm using xchart which uses tab completion to fill the name in - makes it easier.
[12:08] <jordan> Yggdrasil: Wait, don't yet
[12:08] <andyb> avagant: sorry - xchat!
[12:08] <Abnerian> >_> I get artifacts whenever I change resolution.
[12:08] <avagant> Yggdrasil: The safer way to do that, is the gksu "update-manager -c"
[12:08] <Yggdrasil> ack
[12:08] <Abnerian> Why>
[12:09] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: ok which inturn suggests wget
[12:09] <k31th> no sound in flash in ff2 on edgy
[12:09] <zmattor_> Can anyone help me get 3D acceleration working with an ati card (9600)?
[12:09] <k31th> anyone else had same prob ?
[12:09] <Yggdrasil> avagant.
[12:09] <Jasey> k3ith: you might want to try the new Flash Player 9 beta
[12:09] <avagant> Yggdrasil:
[12:09] <Yggdrasil> too late
[12:09] <avagant> tisk tisk tisk.
[12:09] <dbglt> is there a ubuntu package for libgpod-0.4?
[12:09] <huntedgod> how do i allow my self to write files in the /usr/local/ dirs?
[12:09] <Jasey> huntedgod, using sudo or su
[12:10] <huntedgod> jasey: yeah, but what about when i use grapichs?
[12:10] <avagant> I'm probably gonna actually get that in a few.
[12:10] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, I doubt very much you'd need wget to use pciutils. However, if you decide to fetch that, you probably wouldn't need anything else (not _certain_ libssl is installed by default, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't).
[12:10] <jordan> Yggdrasil: read: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades first
[12:10] <Yggdrasil> too late dood
[12:10] <avagant> andyb: I need to find a python now playing script that works and how to do it.
[12:10] <Yggdrasil> ;(
[12:10] <zmattor> Can anyone help me get 3D acceleration working with an ati card (9600)? I have installed fglrx but i dont know really how to get it working
[12:10] <Jasey> huntedgod, whatever program you use to manipulate graphics, run it with gksu in a terminal.
[12:11] <jordan> Yggdrasil: read it anyways, there are a few extra steps to ensure a good upgrade
[12:11] <andyb> avagant: Not sure what you mean - now playing what?
[12:11] <Yggdrasil> ok
[12:11] <BAzfH_> zmattor: there are several good howtos around
=== kooldeep_ is now known as kooldeep
[12:11] <Jasey> huntedgod, or learn the mv command in conjuction with sudo
[12:11] <crackintosh> Can someone suggest a reason why VNC is no longer accepting connections on my edgy machine? It was working yesterday. I tried rebooting.
[12:11] <BAzfH_> zmattor: see ubuntu.com wiki
[12:11] <avagant> andyb: For when I'm playing music.
[12:11] <gulxoc> compas in spanish pliss
[12:11] <avagant> and do the command /np or something
[12:11] <avagant> /np
[12:11] <huntedgod> is there a way to allow "A SUPER USER" that can write to any place?
[12:11] <bandaid> anyone here have any experience with compiz or beryl
[12:11] <SAM_theman> Yo peeps
[12:11] <Jasey> super users can always write to any place
[12:11] <^pixel__> huntedgod: not my problem
[12:11] <jordan> bandaid: try #ubuntu-xgl
[12:12] <bandaid> to jordan ok thanks
[12:12] <huntedgod> pixel: yeah i know
[12:12] <^pixel__> :)
[12:12] <avagant> oh man which xchat should i get, they have new ones!
[12:12] <Abnerian> Hey, in Terminal Server Client, I am trying to connect to a Windows machine running UltraVNC.
[12:12] <andyb> avagant: Hmmm - not sure. Do you mean something that's already playing in another app? You'd need to find out about that pp's API I guess.
[12:12] <Jasey> avagant, use the xchat in the repositories ..
[12:12] <andyb> avagant: s/pp/app/
[12:12] <Abnerian> The machine that is running it is 192.168.1.101
[12:13] <georgeb> huntedgod: the root user can write anywhere; if you put sudo before the command you can run commands as root
[12:13] <avagant> Jasey that's what I mean.
[12:13] <avagant> There's xchat gnome common and xchat gnome
[12:13] <avagant> Should I just get them all?
[12:13] <avagant> Haha
[12:13] <borfast> Yggdrasil: if APT is still just downlodinhg the packages, interrupt it now and use the safe upgrade method
[12:13] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, also: be aware that Suggests is a more mild recommendation, whereas Recommend often indicates something you really want.
[12:13] <avagant> andyb: I mean like if I'm playing music and want to display in the chatroom what I'm listening to.
[12:13] <sethk> avagant, you don't need to.  just get xchat gnome, and it will pull in whatever else you need
[12:14] <avagant> That kinda script.
[12:14] <sredojevics> avagant: xchat-gnome is my favorite: http://xchat-gnome.navi.cx
[12:14] <vanl> #ubuntu-xgl
[12:14] <avagant> I remember having little to no luck with premade scripts, maybe that'll be my first python "task"
[12:15] <phenex> guys, i need some urgent help :( my edgy just decided to remove synaptic from the system menu, and any attempt to use apt-get returns nothing...
[12:15] <sredojevics> is it possible to do pppoe configuration in the graphical manner with NetworkManager or users still need to use pppoeconf command line tool?
[12:15] <sethk> phenex, boot the live cd, do a chroot, and reinstall apt-get
[12:16] <andyb> avagant: I think you need to find out how to interface to the player you are using if you want to pull the name of the song out of the player. What are you playing the songs in?
[12:16] <avagant> Well nothing yet, I haven't actually gotten a player or music. Usually I use xmms.
[12:16] <phenex> damn... i don't have any live cd's here -_-
[12:16] <avagant> I just migrated back from Windows.
[12:16] <avagant> After migrating to windows from ubuntu.
[12:17] <georgeb> phenex: if you run apt-get what happens ? do you get an error ?
[12:17] <avagant> I thought there were things I couldn't live without but that stands to be false.
[12:17] <BAzfH_> avagant: lol thats funny
[12:17] <ScreaminIke> can i get same help? i wanted to rename the contents of 6 folders. mp3s. currently titled as <artist name> - <track #> - <title>.mp3 to <track #> - <artist name> - <title>.mp3
[12:17] <avagant> RO is a big waste of hd and time, and last-fm plugins are as well.
[12:17] <phenex> georgeb, nothing... sudo apt-get remove synaptic
[12:17] <phenex> lera@lera-desktop:~$
[12:17] <phenex> just goes to the next line...
[12:18] <avagant> brb
[12:18] <andyb> avagant: xmms may have an api which allows you to read what it's playing but I don't know. You'd have to check the xmms docs.
[12:18] <jordan> sethk: I know what a chroot is, but how would he reinstall apt without dpkg? if he is a chroot he has no access to dpkg from that chroot, only from the LiveCD, I am curious in case I ever need to fix a similar problem.
[12:18] <avagant> ya andyb it does.
[12:18] <avagant> infopipe or something along those lines.
[12:18] <avagant> at any rate i'm switching onto xchat right now.
[12:18] <sethk> jordan, by setting a path to dpkg on the cd
[12:18] <georgeb> phenex: try sudo apt-get install synaptic
[12:18] <BAzfH_> ScreaminIk: i think 'mp3rename' could help ya.. otherwise with a little bit of scripting with sed and so on you should be fine
[12:18] <sethk> jordan, or possibly just by copying the binaries.
[12:18] <jordan> sethk: Got it :)
[12:19] <phenex> georgeb, same result.

[12:21] <Abnerian> But
[12:21] <Abnerian> UltraVNC doesn't ask me for a username
[12:21] <BAzfH_> Abnerian: i dont know if it changed in edgy. but in dapper the version is really buggy and far from productional usage
[12:21] <phenex> jordan, nope... did nothing right away :P
[12:22] <Abnerian> Oh
[12:22] <avagant_> WTF
[12:22] <BAzfH_> Abnerian: vnc does not have a username
[12:22] <Abnerian> What should I use instead?
[12:22] <avagant_> It's not letting me into my own nickname.
[12:22] <Abnerian> Is there any VNC viewer I can use instead?
[12:22] <jordan> phenex: That is really bizarre I have to say
[12:22] <BAzfH_> i dont know
[12:23] <BAzfH_> i needed it to connect to a ica/rdp server.. therefore i could fall back to the original ica client

[12:31] <jordan> jrib: What do you mean "no root?"
[12:32] <jaek> georgeb, i dont have that file
[12:32] <jrib> phenex: su to root and do 'sudo adduser phenex admin'
[12:32] <sethk> ScreaminIke, you can use the rename command to do that
[12:32] <jrib> jordan: he meant in the group list I think
[12:32] <phenex> sethk, thanks for reminding me my english is lame :)
[12:32] <phenex> can't su
[12:32] <sethk> phenex, not being a troll, just making sure I understood
[12:32] <phenex> su: Authentication failure
[12:33] <dbglt> is there a way to install a package, using apt-get, and ignorning deps?
[12:33] <jrib> phenex: then reboot and select "recovery mode" from the grub menu and issue 'adduser phenex admin'
[12:33] <dbglt> I want to install a package, but not its associated dependencies
[12:33] <sethk> phenex, sounds like you may need to boot a live cd, and set the root password.
[12:33] <gleidson> help - is from brazil ?  cammand ?
[12:33] <sethk> phenex, try jrib's idea first
[12:33] <jordan> dbglt: Yes, but it is verry much not recommended
[12:33] <Flannel> dbglt: er... dependencies are there for a reason, usually because they're needed for the program
[12:33] <sethk> !br
[12:33] <ubotu> Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[12:33] <georgeb> jaek: hmm.. I might have that file from sendmail; but I have there the user I setup during ubuntu install
[12:33] <dbglt> jordan: I'm building the packages I want from CVS/SVN, and it keeps trying to install them
[12:33] <Abnerian> Hey, I am having trouble with changing resolution. Whenever I change my resolution, I get strange bars and artifacts all over my screen.
[12:34] <sc0tt> um
[12:34] <Abnerian> How can I avoid this?
[12:34] <tony_> OK, i added those download entries to the sources.list.. what next ???
[12:34] <boink> !tell gleidson about br
[12:34] <sc0tt> how can i fix my keyboard layout? :>
[12:34] <georgeb> jaek: run mail as your user to see if you have any mail :)
[12:34] <sc0tt> I want it to be standard uk
[12:34] <axisys> is there a how to install ubuntu 6.10 w/ LVM? i know of http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto from the bot
[12:34] <sethk> Abnerian, choose resolutions/vertical frequencies that your monitor can handle
[12:34] <jaek> georgeb, this machine doesnt have 'mail'...
[12:34] <sc0tt> and, its in some whacko mode
[12:34] <sc0tt> :P
[12:34] <phenex> hmm... i've added myself to admin group or something like that via "users and groups" and apt-get works now...
[12:34] <Abnerian> I did. I chose 1200x800 @ 60hz.
[12:34] <Bensin> sethk: Are you aware of others having problems upgrading from 6.06 to 6.10?
[12:34] <Jeruvy> ubotu died methinks...
[12:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about died methinks... - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:34] <Abnerian> It handles it fine under Windows.
[12:34] <phenex> looks like my groups were just messed up...
[12:35] <thejnaitor> how do I view what drives are attached to my computer or whatever? Like /hda1, etc.
[12:35] <sethk> Bensin, yes, but I don't know if the reason is the same
[12:35] <georgeb> jaek: then I guess you can't receive mail; you might have to install sendmail or postfix to receive mail; not sure though
[12:35] <dbglt> jordan: how do I do it? I can't seem to find the information in apt-get manual
[12:35] <jordan> dbglt: If you use checkinstall instead of make-install apt might not complain since it can see the packages are installed.
[12:35] <Abnerian> Anyone know why my monitor does that?
[12:35] <tony_> OK, i added those download entries to the sources.list.. what next ???
[12:35] <cntb> have skype ..deb on Desktop can synaptic install it ? if not how ?
[12:36] <dbglt> jordan: at this stage I'm not really bothered, I just need to install one supporting package, and it keeps trying to reinstall everything. I know I have the required dependencies for the package
[12:36] <sethk> Abnerian, the vertical frequencies are probably wrong.  use dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, choose middle difficulty level for monitor configuration, and choose the resolutions you want to be able to display
[12:36] <sethk> Abnerian, it's possible that your config isn't right, and X is using a set of default configurations.
[12:36] <sethk> Abnerian, in any event, if you choose the right resolutions, you'll be able to switch among them
[12:37] <jordan> dbglt: I did it once with dpkg, I am looking through the manpages now for the switch.
[12:37] <Abnerian> uh
[12:37] <Abnerian> How do I do that?
[12:37] <Abnerian> This is my first day using Linux.
[12:37] <sex_machine> people my firefox crashes? anyone knows why?
[12:37] <sethk> Abnerian, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:37] <jordan> dbglt: --ignore-depends
[12:38] <sethk> Abnerian, then follow the menus.  take all the defaults until you come to monitor configuration
[12:38] <georgeb> !firefox fixes
[12:38] <ubotu> firefox: lightweight web browser based on Mozilla. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0+0dfsg-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 9001 kB, installed size 28588 kB

[12:38] <tony_> After adding entries to download flash in my sources. list. i get GPG error .. regarding some public key ..
[12:38] <Sethiano> There seems to be not problem with the files. I have sucessfully downloaded them and unziped them in Firefox. Anybody got a solution to this Egdy uprade problem?
[12:38] <lupine_85> RMS must be crying in his sleep :p
[12:38] <n1gke> !moo
[12:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about moo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:38] <cntb> abnerian what about yesterday ? werent you using linux
[12:39] <tony_> W: GPG error: http://seveas.imbrandon.com dapper-seveas Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 49A120FD1135D466
[12:39] <tony_> how can i resolve this
[12:39] <sethk> Sethiano, some suggested (I'm not sure who) that there is a persistent bad download.  Did you run that command (to erase any downloaded package files)?
[12:39] <sex_machine> firefox crash wih edgy? anyone knows why?
[12:39] <roig> i get this error "word too long" when I "csh myprogram" anyone can help me please?
[12:39] <sethk> sex_machine, not without lots more information.  It doesn't generally do that, if that's what you are asking.
[12:40] <kabeljauw> i'm having a hard time getting the ati radeon driver to work in ubuntu.. strange thing is, it worked perfectly before i decided to reinstall due to repartitioning :(
[12:40] <sex_machine> i guess it is a problem with flash
[12:40] <jordan> tony_: run: wget http://seveas.imbrandon.com/1135D466.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[12:40] <deep> Anyone having problems with nvidia drivers, more then me?
[12:40] <Sethiano> sethk, Yeah, it stil does not work :(
[12:40] <Simple> 3D Sound Blaster Pro
[12:40] <sex_machine> i have edgy and amd64
[12:40] <kabeljauw> i took the liberty of pastebin'ing my xorg.conf
[12:40] <jaa6c6> does anyone recommend a alternative to EAC for linux?
[12:40] <kabeljauw> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30227/
[12:40] <sex_machine> sethk: do you know what is the problem?
[12:40] <sethk> sex_machine, no, not without a lot more information
[12:40] <yoink> does anyone use Music Player Daemon, and would you recommend it?
[12:41] <sex_machine> what you need sethk?
[12:41] <SAM_theman> checking for GTK... configure: error: GTK+-2.8 is required to compile murrine
[12:41] <SAM_theman> wtf??
[12:41] <VSpike> What is the difference between "Generic Complete Linux Kernel" (linux) and "Complete Generic Linux Kernel" (linux-generic)?
[12:41] <BAzfH_> okay.. time to have some sleep
[12:41] <BAzfH_> good night
[12:41] <sabu> those instructions seem a bit ot of date
[12:41] <jordan> jrib:  Any progress on getting root / sudo to work?
[12:42] <sethk> sex_machine, how are you running it?  where do you see the error?  what error exactly do you get?
[12:42] <sex_machine> it simple disapears
[12:42] <tony_> i don't know how to do that
[12:42] <tony_> this is crazy ..
[12:42] <jrib> jordan: yep, phenex was able to use sudo after adding himself to admin
[12:42] <sethk> sex_machine, so you don't know what really happens.  Try running it from a console.
[12:42] <sethk> sex_machine, then you'll be able to see any error messages
[12:43] <jordan> tony_: open the terminal and paset this into it and hit return: wget http://seveas.imbrandon.com/1135D466.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[12:43] <cntb> intel went core2 duo and quad . so generic maybe a kernel that ignores advanced features . right?
[12:43] <georgeb> VSpike: I don't think there's a difference, just an alias
[12:43] <sethk> cntb, you certainlyl want SMP
[12:44] <sex_machine> sethk: LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library libXt.so
[12:44] <cntb> intel prices are going lower am I right ?
[12:44] <sethk> cntb, all prices are allows going to down
[12:44] <sethk> cntb, when, how much, I don't know of course
[12:44] <cntb> anyway night here xen and skype not working
[12:45] <tuxtoti>  i have a different..version of ld installed in a diff path which is needed by my program for the linking....I think i have to change some env variable..for it to not to use the default ld
[12:45] <tuxtoti> can some one tell me which variable..
[12:45] <sex_machine> sethk: maybe the problem is that i use a 32 bit plugin in firefox 64 bits
[12:45] <cntb> wanted to play with client's machne b4 deliver
[12:45] <VSpike> georgeb: it doesn't look like an alias, but I could well be wrong
[12:45] <sethk> sex_machine, that would certainly cause a problem, yes.  :)
[12:45] <sex_machine> what do you think sethk?
[12:45] <cntb> next time
[12:45] <VSpike> I'll install both and see what happens
[12:45] <cntb> bye bye
[12:45] <mjr> sex_machine, that is indeed impossible
[12:45] <sex_machine> what should i do?
[12:45] <sethk> sex_machine, do    ldd /usr/bin/firefox     (if that's not where firefox is, use "which firefox" to find it)
[12:45] <Kingsqueak> anyone else finding gnome-session is crashy with amd64 edgy?
[12:45] <sethk> sex_machine, don't use a 32 bit plugin   :)
[12:46] <deep> "make sure that the kernel module and all the nvidia componens have the same version"? :S
[12:46] <tony_> 'i got this at the end.. gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found .. so i guess is not working
[12:46] <deep> :(
[12:46] <sex_machine> /usr/bin/ldd: line 171: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: Arquivo ou diretrio inexistente
[12:46] <sex_machine> ldd: /lib/ld-linux.so.2 terminou com cdigo de sada desconhecido (127)
[12:46] <sethk> sex_machine, definitely mixed up versions.
[12:46] <sethk> sex_machine, try reinstalling firefox
[12:46] <sex_machine> what should i do?
[12:47] <deep> This just sucks.
[12:47] <deep> :S
[12:47] <sethk> sex_machine, how did you install firefox?  From the repos?
[12:47] <morphish> sex_machine: you would need nsplugin-wrapper to use 32bit plugins in a 64bit firefox, it's alpha and behaves as such, having said that, it does work
[12:48] <tony_> well, was nice working with linux, i guess i switch back to window.. to much pain working with linux..
[12:48] <sethk> tony_, it's not for everyone
[12:48] <thejnaitor> I have a sata hd. How do I find out what it is listed as? like hda1 or whatever?
[12:48] <robster> greetings
[12:48] <tony_> yehh. it sure looks like it,, and this is not the way to grab larger market shar on OS
[12:48] <sethk> thejnaitor, SATA will be sda, sdb, etc.
[12:48] <georgeb> VSpike: this are called meta packages; The Meta Package is a set of packages that are distributed in one structure.; they are just aliases; if you do apt-cache show linux you see that "Depends: linux-generic"; now apt-cache show linux-generic "Depends: linux-image-generic, linux-restricted-modules-generic"; apt-cache show linux-image-generic "Depends: linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic"
[12:49] <donvito> can i boot ubuntu from floppy?
[12:49] <sex_machine> i don't understand morphish
[12:49] <thejnaitor> sethk thank you
[12:49] <mc_> thejnaitor: ide will hda,hdb and so on
[12:49] <sex_machine> what should i do?
[12:49] <sethk> tony_, nobody is trying to grab market share here.
[12:49] <phab> thejnaitor, you can try running this, sudo fdisk -l
[12:49] <Simple> Why can't I find Headphone jack Sense in the Volume Control?
[12:49] <georgeb> thejnaitor: sata is /dev/sda; /dev/sdb; etc
[12:49] <sethk> tony_, you trade free against needing to do some work.
[12:49] <robster> I just installed ubuntu (newest version)
[12:49] <robster> and can't get easyubuntu to run
[12:49] <sethk> tony_, what good is market share to a free operating system?
[12:50] <jrib> tony_: you can just download the deb and double click on it if you want too
[12:50] <morphish> sex_machine: either check the forum threadon how to run 32bit softwate in a chroot in ubuntu, use 32bit libs to satisfy the 32bit firefoxes needs, but then you are left alone w/o apt helping you, or use a wrapper to allow 32bit plugins in a 64bit browser
[12:50] <robster> it flashes at the bottom of the screen and doesn't come up
[12:50] <donvito> can i boot ubuntu from floppy?
[12:50] <UFO64> sethk, braging rights
[12:50] <tony_> in todays OS enviroment, i guess, users are not all expertes.. so , things should kinda work ..
[12:50] <sethk> donvito, it's possible, but not really simple
[12:50] <sex_machine> can i install firefox 32 bits morphish?
[12:50] <donvito> how to than
[12:50] <sethk> tony_, if that's what you need, and windows works well for you, use it.
[12:50] <donvito> i cant boot it from cd
[12:50] <donvito> so i must bot from floppy than installing from cd
[12:50] <dbglt> jordan: can I use that with apt-get? Rather than dpkg?
[12:50] <morphish> sex_machine: find the 32bit chroot thread, it seems simple
[12:51] <jordan> tony_: But Ubuntu is trying to make things easier, it is getting better all the time, try again in a year or two, I find Ubuntu easier than windows now though :)
[12:51] <robster> any reason why EasyUbuntu won't run in 6.10?
[12:51] <k31th> Guys, iv mounted my windows drive (ntfs) root can access it fine but my stanard user cannot any ideas?
[12:51] <dbglt> jordan: I just want to install amarok-xine. I have my own version of amarok built, but it keeps trying to bloody rebuild amarok
[12:51] <morphish> sex_machine: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575 found it
[12:51] <tony_> never payed for windows either.. lol. so i guess is free consept of OS is valid for window
[12:51] <axisys> anyone can say one or two word about lvm? idea case would be offering a `how to install ubuntu 6.10 w/ lvm"
[12:51] <axisys> *ideal
[12:51] <Clujo> wish the software updates screen would let you uncheck the whole list.
[12:52] <sethk> tony_, you paid for it.  it just wasn't itemized
[12:52] <Chris_XY> does anybody here have a detailed tutorial how to get a pinnacle pctv 300i working? ;)
[12:52] <sethk> tony_, after some lawsuits, you can now buy the same machine for less money without windows, at least in some countries
[12:52] <jordan> tony_: I run Ubuntu on my macbook pro, I usually stay in Ubuntu :) ( I often find it easier than OSx also )
[12:52] <tony_> is eaiser yes.. some stuff i needed , and i installed trough synaptic .. but the rest.. with all this shell command and stuff. is pain
[12:52] <robster> can anyone answer my question?
[12:52] <robster> or is this the correct forum for technical questions
[12:53] <mc_> robster: be more specific please
[12:53] <Chris_XY> robster: what does it do instead of running? ;)
[12:53] <sethk> tony_, if windows is better for you, use it.  Don't complain because something that is free doesn't precisely match your needs.
[12:53] <jordan> tony_: most of the time you can just copy and paste the commands people give you though
[12:53] <TIger_IT> robster:  I dont know EasyUbuntu  distro
[12:53] <christoopher> gah, I installed windows xp on a seperate hardrive, and it overwrote my MBR, how can I get brub working again?
[12:53] <robster> it's not a distro
[12:53] <mc_> TIger_IT: EasyUbuntu is a programm that automates some common tasks
[12:53] <christoopher> grub*
[12:53] <robster> supposed to automate ...
[12:53] <robster> yes
[12:53] <TIger_IT> mc_: thanks
[12:53] <robster> It flashes on the task bar, but goes away
[12:53] <robster> and doesn't actually launch
[12:53] <tony_> no complains ..
[12:53] <mc_> robster: try automatix2,its better anyway
[12:53] <dbglt> christoopher: just boot a live cd or similar, and go in and fix up grub
[12:53] <sex_machine> morphish: if i use that all my follow instlations will be 32 bit version?
[12:54] <jordan> tony_: And most of the time you can do the same thing in the GUI, we just prefer command line instructions on IRC because they are easier to explain ( just copy and paste )
[12:54] <robster> dvd and mp3 auto installs?
[12:54] <TIger_IT> automatix2 ? xD
[12:54] <piratepete> msg NickServ IDENTIFY joecool
[12:54] <robster> k
[12:54] <tony_> i only think . linux has not grabed the attention of users like me ..
[12:54] <robster> have a website for it?
[12:54] <christoopher> dbglt, could I use a gentoo cd, then just do grub-install?
=== Echtor2oo3 is now known as Echtor`off
[12:54] <dbglt> christoopher: should be able to chroot in
[12:55] <christoopher> dbglt, thasnks
[12:55] <dbglt> christoopher: that's what I used to do with lilo, anyway
[12:55] <tony_> Idea for using OS ( computer in general ) for me is to do the job . and do it fast.. lol.
[12:55] <axisys> still looking for some lvm hints
[12:55] <skt> andyb you still here?
[12:55] <morphish> sex_machine: no, you get a 64bit and 32bit install method, 32bit ends up in the chroot (change root, like a new / under some other directory, that / is then 32bits, and apps get run from there) your 64bit system does nto change
[12:55] <jordan> tony_: Remember, you have been learning Windows for years, again, I find Linux easier, but I didn't get it the first day I used it.
[12:55] <tony_> im not a gamer .. so i just need project to be done.. and well, i can not even install FLASH .. now i need to rebuild everyting and install and test on Window
[12:56] <jrib> tony_: we try to keep #ubuntu for support, feel free to discuss this in #ubuntu-offtopic though.  In case you missed it earlier by the way, your installation of flash can be done by downloading the .deb file to your desktop and double clicking on it
[12:56] <jordan> tony_: You want me to give you complete GUI instructions for adding flash?
[12:56] <morphish> tony_: http://www.linuxrsp.ru/win-lin-soft/table-eng.html https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WhatWindowsUsersWant now get your work done ;)
[12:57] <tony_> that .dep is for 32bit. im running 64 bit
[12:57] <morphish> side note tony_ while not the recommended way, if you follow firefox through it's install flash thing, flash will afterwards work, just as simple as it would be in windows
[12:57] <jrib> tony_: flash does not work on 64 bit afaik
[12:58] <morphish> tony_: oh you run Win XP x86_64 ?
[12:58] <cosmodad> has anyone else experienced system lockups when using the switch functionality of gnome-screensaver?
[12:58] <tony_> but flash 9 beta dose.. and thats what im trying to install
[12:58] <sethk> tony_, 64 bit support is very spotty.  Just a few minutes of looking would have revealed that to you before you started.
[12:58] <jrib> tony_: http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2006/10/whats_so_difficult_64bit_editi.html
[12:58] <jordan> tony_: Ther is no 64 bit flash in windows either AFIK.
[12:58] <Kleggas> when trying to run nautilus in other desktop than gnome (like e17), I get the default iconset instead of the one I choose in gnome. how do I change the iconset outside of gnome for nautilus.
[12:59] <tony_> anyways.. thanks for the helps. appreciate it..
=== cricht0n is now known as cricht0ff
[01:00] <khaije1> Kleggas: i don't know but i've seen the same type of thing... when i x11'd nautilus from my buddy and it changed my desktop wallpaper!?!
[01:00] <dbglt> bah
[01:00] <dbglt> after all that
[01:00] <dbglt> seems I don't need amarok-xine installed
[01:00] <dbglt> haha
[01:00] <kingace> hi
[01:01] <kingace> i just got beryl working... i was wondering, are there different types of themes for windows\the start menu (like GTK vs. Emerald or something)?
[01:01] <avagant> andyb you still here still?
[01:01] <coz_> kingace, open emerald theme manager
[01:01] <Kleggas> kingace: emerald has its own themes, and it still changes only the window borders. gtk is still what you use for the style
[01:01] <Simian__> where is loopback stored
[01:02] <jordan> !seen andyb | avagant
[01:02] <sethk> Simian__, question doesn't make sense.  try to rephrase
[01:02] <lupine_85> Simian__: that question doesn't make much sense, I'm afraid
[01:02] <lupine_85> snap :p
[01:02] <khaije1> kingace: that is the difference between a window manager / window decorator and a desktop environment
[01:03] <jordan> !seen andyb | avagant
[01:03] <kingace> right yeah that was just my innaccurate example
[01:03] <khaije1> when you run beryl/emerald you're only replacing a small part of your normal setup
[01:03] <lupine_85> when you mount a loopback device, it ends up at the mountpoint. Where you store the file is up to you. The devicefiles are /dev/loop?
[01:04] <bruenig> !ubotu
[01:04] <kingace> for example, on gnome-look, which section would effect the start menus and all, and which would effect windows and such? bear with me here, I'm a major newbie to all of this
[01:04] <avagant> now it works, and i know why it didn't before.
[01:04] <abnerian> Hey. Can someone help me with xtightvncviewer? I am trying to access a VNC server set up at 192.168.1.101. The server is running on port 80. The password is in a file on my desktop. What would the command be to run xtightvncviewer and VNC into my windows box?

[01:06] <Chris_XY> anyone here who can describe, what to do to install a pinnacle pctv 300i? ;-)
[01:06] <robster> ok ... so I'm trying to install automatix and gedit won't open.  "Cannot open display"
[01:06] <HymnToLife> !automatix
[01:06] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:06] <HymnToLife> automatix is evil, please don't use it
[01:06] <robster> ha
[01:06] <robster> ok
[01:06] <zcat[1] > btw; does vnc work with beryl (the inbuild share-my-desktop vnc in ubuntu)? It was broken with compiz....
[01:07] <bruenig> robster, if you are just trying to add their repo, just use nano
[01:07] <HymnToLife> !easyubuntu
[01:07] <ubotu> easyubuntu is easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/  -  For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[01:07] <HymnToLife> better :)
[01:07] <sethk> robson, has nothing to do with automatix.  Most likely your DISPLAY environment variable isn't set.
[01:07] <khaije1> why'z that HymnToLife?
[01:07] <robster> what about EasyUbunto
[01:07] <sethk> robert_, or X isn't running.
[01:07] <bruenig> robster, is there anything in particular you need help installing
[01:07] <windmill_> !samba
[01:07] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[01:07] <robster> I initially started with that and was advised about 10 minutes ago to use automatix

[01:07] <windmill_> !swat
[01:07] <fanta> easyubuntu for 6.10 ?????
[01:07] <bruenig> robster, they both have risks attached to them. I have only used easyubuntu once and I found that it just didn't work and automatix did break my system once but I have used it probablt 8 or 9 times
[01:07] <zcat[1] > hmm... nope!
[01:07] <robster> I really just want to install dvd and mp3 support
[01:07] <kingace> khaije: thanks for all your help. my (hopefully) last question is, am I correct in saying that an emerald theme and a gtk theme wouldnt effect each other?
[01:08] <bruenig> robster, have you checked the restricted formats page of the wiki
[01:08] <gu014> hello, i am having a problem with my bottom launcher panel. i.e. one of the launchers has "wine /home/sean/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/DVD\ Shrink/DVD\ Shrink\ 3.2.exe" for its command....when i click on the icon nothing happens...however, when i run the same command from the console it loads fine. any ideas?
[01:08] <bruenig> !restricted | robster
[01:08] <ubotu> robster: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[01:08] <mc_> robster: and i use automatix for a long time and never expierience any problems
[01:08] <robster> I've been on that Restricted Formats page
[01:08] <mc_> robster: first af all install w32codecs,if it is not a crime in your country
[01:08] <robster> just trying to do install them automatically
[01:08] <skelter> gu014: try putting quotes around that path, for the launcher alias?
[01:09] <robster> is it a crime in Canada?
[01:09] <Simian__> i have a dynamic ip address. when i point my browser to that address it just goes to my router setting. I have fixed this problem before but i just can't remember the file that i need to edit
[01:09] <jordan> robster: No, I don't think so.
[01:09] <robster> k
[01:09] <jordan> robster: I think it is also fine in the U.S if you also own windows
[01:09] <mc_> robster: only in the us
[01:09] <khaije1> kingace: ask as many questions as you like... in this case the only gnome-y aspects that would be overtaken by beryl are the "gnome window decorator" settings
[01:09] <kingace> what exactly does gtk effect?
[01:10] <kingace> *gtk themes, sorry
[01:10] <HymnToLife> no need for w32codecs for DVD and mp3
[01:10] <khaije1> kingace: actually lets move this to #ubuntu-xgl and I'll explain a little more... ?
[01:10] <zcat[1] > Simian__: set up eth0:1 to the dynamic address, so it gets answere locally and doesn't go to the router.
[01:10] <robster> so ... is there any reason why gedit won't open display?
[01:10] <kingace> sounds fine to me, see ya there
[01:10] <bruenig> HymnToLife is right. For mp3 and dvd, w32codecs are not needed
[01:10] <HymnToLife> you just need libxine-extracodecs and libdvdcss
[01:10] <sethk> robster, answered, at least four times.
[01:10] <mc_> HymnToLife: but for general multimedia  w32codecs are usefull
[01:10] <robster> I installed libdvdcss and it works ... fine
[01:10] <gu014> skelter, did not work for me. not sure if it means anything but, when i run the command from console there are some errors: Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".  does this help>
[01:10] <Simian__> zcat[1] : ok thanks
[01:11] <zcat[1] > eth0:1    inet addr:60.234.226.80  Bcast:60.255.255.255  Mask:255.255.255.255
[01:11] <zcat[1] > Like so...
[01:11] <gu014> im using an ati card
[01:11] <robster> ok ... so display environment.  How do I set that?
[01:11] <Chris_XY> noone wants to help me :( i just want to get my pinnacle 300i working ...
[01:11] <zcat[1] > It's trickier whrn you have dynamic ip, you have to write a cron job that picks up the address from the router and reconfigures the network when it changes :)

[01:11] <ubotu> Chris_XY: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[01:12] <jordan> robster: The easiest thing to do is just run the command in gnome-terminal : applications -> accessories -> terminal
[01:12] <Chris_XY> :)
[01:12] <robster> I tried that command in the gnome-terminal
[01:12] <robster> and got the no display message
[01:12] <sethk> robson, you get the message that you could not connect to the X server, right?
[01:13] <axisys> is there a chnl where I can talk about LVM ?
[01:13] <robster> I guess ...
[01:13] <sethk> robson, sorry, tab completion
[01:13] <HymnToLife> running GUI apps as root is a bad idean anyway
[01:13] <HymnToLife> idea*
[01:13] <sethk> robster, no need to guess.  try it and tell us.  As I've already told you, the likely reason is that the DISPLAY environment variable is not set.
[01:13] <bruenig> as long as you gksudo gui apps, it is fine. But as a general practice I try to keep root editing and stuff in vim or nano
[01:14] <robster> sethk: OK ... I understand that the DISPLAY environment is not set.  How do I set it?
[01:14] <sethk> robster, export DISPLAY=:0.0
[01:14] <sethk> robster, will set it to :0.0
[01:15] <sethk> HymnToLife, did you mean that robster is running as root, by the way?
[01:15] <barnetod> anyone do any programming in here?
[01:15] <robster> Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
[01:15] <robster> Xlib: No protocol specified
[01:15] <sethk> barnetod, sure, lots of people.

[01:15] <HymnToLife> !anyone
[01:15] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[01:15] <barnetod> whats the best c IDE environment
[01:15] <robster> I am su'd to root (su - followed by password)
[01:15] <barnetod> im having to take a programming class and new to linux
[01:15] <mc_> barnetod: emacs
[01:15] <HymnToLife> vim :)
[01:15] <bruenig> vim
[01:15] <sethk> robster, in another window, as the normal user (not as root), do this:     xhost +
[01:15] <zcat[1] > robster: try going back to your normal shell and using "sudo command"
[01:15] <sethk> robster, then back in this window, try running again.
[01:15] <robster> k
[01:15] <barnetod> i use Dev-c++, or borland.  but i officially hate windows :)
[01:16] <mc_> anyone else should say emacs too
[01:16] <sethk> robster, try zcat[1]  's suggestion first
[01:16] <bruenig> anyone else should say vim too
[01:16] <barnetod> mc is that package in ubuntu already?
[01:16] <sethk> barnetod, I like anjuta
[01:16] <barnetod> or do i need to download?
[01:16] <sethk> barnetod, eclipse is good for java
[01:16] <atarinox> can anybody give me some help getting this flash plugin to work with firefox?
[01:16] <mc_> otherwise he'll join the evil cult of of ci ^^
[01:16] <barnetod> im willing to try anything
[01:16] <sethk> barnetod, anjuta is in the repositories
[01:16] <mc_> barnetod: emacs-snapshot
[01:16] <bruenig> atarinox, what is the problem?
[01:16] <georgeb> !flash
[01:16] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[01:16] <HymnToLife> atarinox, did you sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree ?
[01:16] <barnetod> let me look lol
[01:16] <barnetod> i might need someone to hold my hand
[01:16] <barnetod> haha
[01:17] <HymnToLife> nothing else should be needed, unless you fant Flash Player 9
[01:17] <atarinox> HymnToLife: yes, now everytime i load a flash page my browser crashes
[01:17] <bruenig> atarinox, don't do the flashplugin-nonfree, it still has 7, you want the flash 9 beta believe me
[01:17] <HymnToLife> want*
[01:17] <zcat[1] > seveas has flash9 packaged!!
[01:17] <sethk> barnetod, others are in the repositories also, I didn't mean that anjuta is the only one there.
[01:17] <zcat[1] > !seveas
[01:17] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[01:17] <atarinox> bruenig: I tried flash 9 beta a little while ago with the same result
[01:18] <atarinox> also changed my screen bit-depth to 24
[01:18] <bruenig> atarinox, you just need to copy it into the firefox plugins directory
[01:18] <HymnToLife> which FF version ?
[01:18] <atarinox> 2.0
[01:18] <HymnToLife> repo or mozilla.com ?
[01:18] <barnetod> seth whats the easiest way to get to repositories
[01:18] <mc_> zcat[1] : 32 or 64 bit?
[01:18] <zcat[1] > we're so bleeding edge :)
[01:18] <zcat[1] > only 32bit
[01:19] <sredojevics> is it possible to do pppoe configuration in the graphical manner with NetworkManager or users still need to use pppoeconf command line tool?
[01:19] <atarinox> so just install the flash 9 plugin on my home folder?
[01:19] <barnetod> i am just trying to figure out synaptics among other things
[01:19] <SAM_theman> Who has a ATI readon 7000 card?
[01:19] <mc_> barnetod: add them to your /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:19] <atarinox> .mozilla/plugins?
[01:19] <DarkMageZ> zcat[1] , bleeding edge = using firefox trunk :P
[01:19] <mc_> !anyone > SAM_theman
[01:19] <barnetod> k
[01:19] <bruenig> atarinox, do you have the libflashplayer.so file?
[01:19] <HymnToLife> atarinox, nope, /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[01:19] <Sylfaen> hello, i got a question regarding accessing my backup drive, i was a window user, and iam new to linux and to ubuntu, please bear with my ignorance :), how can i access my hard drive where i all stored my files, it say on my computer cant mount drive
[01:19] <SAM_theman> Ok because I am trying to get my gaMES to play and they wont
[01:20] <HymnToLife> !fat

[01:20] <zcat[1] > I used to run nightly builds, but then I decided I like having by bookmarks....
[01:20] <atarinox> bruenig: not anymore
[01:20] <Sylfaen> btw partioning is ntfs
[01:20] <iter> !find darkstat
[01:20] <ubotu> Found: darkstat
[01:20] <HymnToLife> well, if you don't have it, no wonder Flash doesn't work :p
[01:20] <atarinox> ill get that 9 beta again and try to copy that file into my /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins folder
[01:21] <robster> Sethk: OK.  That worked (ie. sudo command from my normal user - not under su)
[01:21] <SAM_theman> What the beta of flash works for me accept it don't play the videos smoothly but sound works
[01:21] <HymnToLife> Sylfaen, see the link ubotu gave
[01:21] <atarinox> HymnToLife: maybe i do...i know i have the 7r68 flash plugin installed
[01:21] <HymnToLife> it has instructions for NTFS too
[01:21] <atarinox> and i know it crashes
[01:21] <axisys> does ubuntu 6.10 offer LVM during installation?
[01:21] <mc_> is frostwire currently broken on edgy?
[01:21] <Sylfaen> ok, doing it rignt now, thanks ^_^
[01:21] <robster> I proceed with the automatix2 install, but ended up with another error
[01:21] <bruenig> atarinox, download this file. Then open a terminal and do "sudo dpkg -i flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.55-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb" http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/pool/dapper/3v1n0/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.55-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb
[01:21] <sethk> robster, right, because your normal user has the rights to display on your X server
[01:22] <robster> "couldn't find package automatix"
[01:22] <DanSchnell> sethk, the gparted liveCD doesn't work on my computer either.  I just get garbled stuff like i do when i try to boot Ubuntu LiveCD
[01:22] <mc_> mc@mc-desktop:~/Desktop$ frostwire
[01:22] <mc_> runFrost.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[01:22] <mc_> robster: www.getautomatix.com
[01:22] <jbroome> no, don't
[01:22] <sethk> DanSchnell, that's not surprising, since they both use the same display subsystem.  but you should be able to run gparted from the console.
[01:22] <atarinox> bruenig: file not found...
[01:23] <bruenig> atarinox, you have to download it first, then put it in your /home/username directory and do that command
[01:23] <robster> mc: that's where I'm at following the instructions (cutting and pasting)
[01:23] <DanSchnell> sethk, i seriously am beginning to think that my computer doesn't want Linux on it.  I think Windows brainwashed it...for serial
[01:23] <atarinox> bruenig: yeah im trying to go to that link...says hte file's not on the server
[01:23] <mc_> robster:  did you do sudo apt-get update?
[01:23] <bruenig> atarinox, oh
[01:23] <robster> yes
[01:23] <sethk> DanSchnell, clearly there's an issue with your graphics hardware and linux.
[01:23] <mc_> robster: sudo apt-get install automatix2
[01:24] <atarinox> same thing as on labs.adobe.com?
[01:24] <zcat[1] > DanSchnell: some chipsets just don't play well with Linux. Sad but true... you might have an unfriendly one.
[01:24] <robster> results in error (some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.)
[01:24] <bruenig> atarinox, follow this howto for a manual install, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279990
[01:24] <robster> mc: Which I'm sure is related
[01:24] <DanSchnell> sethk, its 2 eVGA 6800GS CO (yes, 2 of them, for SLI)
[01:25] <shannon> I need the 2.6.17-7 kernel on edgy. How do I get that?
[01:25] <robster> anyway, I've got to run for now
[01:25] <robster> maybe come back to this later.  Thanks all for your help (esp. Sethk and MC)
[01:25] <robster> later
[01:25] <bruenig> atarinox, I just downloaded from that link I just gave you for the .deb so I know it works.........
[01:25] <cosmodad> has anyone else experienced system lockups/freezes when using the switch functionality of gnome-screensaver (possibly also involving mouse problems)?
[01:26] <cosmodad> in edgy...
[01:26] <christopher> I used to run windows/ubuntu, now I want just ubuntu, so I formated windows hd, but now grub is gone and linux wont boot. I'm in the linux live cd now, but I'm not sure what to do.
[01:27] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: in dapper with xgl/beryl, I consistantly can't switch back from my wife's login once the screensaver has started. My session crashes as soon as I try and I have to log back in.
[01:27] <Rappermas> i just screwed up my drivers, how do I reverse an apt-get dist-upgrade?
[01:27] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : same thing here, but with edgy
[01:27] <towsonu2003> Rappermas, you can't
[01:27] <Rappermas> serious?
[01:27] <bruenig> Rappermas, yeah
[01:27] <Rappermas> ....
[01:27] <Rappermas> ok, now i'm just angry
[01:27] <mc_> Rappermas: tell us your driver problem,maybe we can help
[01:28] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : apart from the fact that it's my girl's account :)  have you found any workaround/fix?
[01:28] <Rappermas> well, nvidia-glx got removed
[01:28] <Rappermas> and now i can't install it
[01:28] <mc_> Rappermas: enabled universe and multiverse?
[01:28] <Rappermas> right
[01:28] <zcat[1] > Yeah, sometimes it works if I switch to a text terminal and kill gnome-screensaver, then switch to my GUI login.. but that's niot much of a workaround :(
[01:28] <Rappermas> as in yes, i have universe and multiverse enabled
[01:28] <khaije1> anyone know how i can set the permenantly set the metric on a network device?
[01:28] <Rappermas> however, sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx gives me:
[01:29] <Rappermas> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[01:29] <Rappermas>   nvidia-glx: Depends: nvidia-kernel-1.0.9625
[01:29] <Rappermas> E: Broken packages
[01:29] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : I wasn't ever able to switch to a console...
[01:29] <mc_> Rappermas: what gives you sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx
[01:29] <noiesmo> Rappermas, do sudo apt-get -f install and then try agin might help
[01:29] <Rappermas> let me try aptitude then -f
[01:29] <atarinox> bruenig: ok i downloaded hte package from that how-to, but the code doesnt seem to work to unpack
[01:30] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : there hasn't been a bug report yet, I'll file one
[01:30] <atarinox> bruenig: what would be the equivalent install procedure through the gui?
[01:30] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: I've only just started playing with edgy.. same problem, if I try and switch to text after the GUI comes up, it's all corrupted. i810 chipset, so it ought to be well supported :(
[01:30] <Rappermas> alright, aptitude is going...
[01:31] <bruenig> atarinox, open a fresh terminal and copy and paste the following command: wget http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/pool/dapper/3v1n0/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.55-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.55-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb
[01:31] <mc_> Rappermas: you should prefer using aptitude over apt-get
[01:31] <bruenig> atarinox, everything after the :
[01:31] <zcat[1] > this machine is staying on dapper for a while anyhow.. my wife's sick of me upgrading every 6 months!
[01:31] <mc_> Rappermas: it's much smarter as you see
[01:31] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : so this bug seems to affect both the dapper and edgy versions of gnome-screensaver. Haven't had any problems with breezy, did you?
[01:31] <Rappermas> yeah it probably is
[01:31] <Rappermas> alright, i need to restart GDM
[01:31] <Rappermas> thanks for the help

[01:32] <mc_> Rappermas: np
[01:32] <zcat[1] > I've only had problems since installing beryl.. the regular server with nvidia drivers was fine.
[01:32] <Plecebo> I'm stuck at the GDM splash screen when i log in it flashes to the command line then back to the gdm login... anyone?
[01:33] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : what's beryl?
[01:33] <HymnToLife> !beryl
[01:33] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[01:33] <zcat[1] > 3d GUI, does all kinds of nice transparency and stuff..
[01:33] <dbglt> unstable
[01:34] <khaije1> cosmodad: it's too sexy for most ;-)
[01:34] <zcat[1] > .. but also breaks a few things like user-switching and VNC ...
[01:34] <mc_> beryl is nice to play with,but not for daily use imho
[01:34] <HymnToLife> KDE does nicer transparency and breaks nothing :)
[01:34] <khaije1> zcat[1] : i don't think thats true
[01:34] <cosmodad> khaije1: I'll remember that :)
[01:34] <bruenig> atarinox, did that worik
[01:34] <zcat[1] > khaije1: what's not true?
[01:34] <scamboy> was up everybody....
[01:35] <khaije1> zcat[1] : breaks multiuser switching
[01:35] <Plecebo> anyone able to help me figure out what is going on with my computer?
[01:35] <bruenig> !anyone | Plecebo
[01:35] <ubotu> Plecebo: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[01:35] <HymnToLife> !anyone
[01:35] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[01:35] <khaije1> zcat[1] : i'm not sure about vnc, but x11-forwarding is unaffected
[01:35] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : so have you had any lock-ups with gnome-screensaver and non-opengl-driven-xorg? possibly also without using vnc or such?
[01:35] <HymnToLife> pwn3d :(
[01:35] <mc_> Plecebo: please be  *A BIT* more specific
[01:35] <atarinox> bruenig: i'm trying to install through the gui, just double clicked hte package on my desktop...seems like it's been installing for few minutes now though. frozen?
[01:35] <Plecebo> i did ask my question
[01:36] <Plecebo> i cant log in... what more info do you need? I log in and then get dumped back to the login prompt
[01:36] <scamboy> plecebo: ask again
[01:36] <Maintech> I've installed Edgy on my system and lost all 3D acceleration. I had it under Dapper. I have installed all the GLX and done everything in the 'How to'. I've been in the forums for 2 weeks and tried everything suggested to get the 3D working. Anyone have any suggestions of where to look for info?
[01:36] <mc_> Plecebo: your gdm log
[01:36] <zcat[1] > Well, it might not be beryl, but if I try to switch back from another login once the screensaver has started, my session crashes every time.. I can switch away from my session into a screensaver'd one no trouble.
[01:36] <Plecebo> i get a flash of the command line
[01:36] <bruenig> atarinox, all you had to do was paste my command, if you are not going to follow my advice, why ask for it? Just a simple highlight and then a paste in the terminal. A couple of minutes later and you would for sure have an operational flash plugin.
[01:36] <scamboy> plecebo: wat happened before that? you update?
[01:36] <Plecebo> the only thing i can think of is installing vmware server
[01:37] <AndyJB> After all the earlier discussion I just tried updating a dapper box with update-manager -c instead of apt-get. It broke horribly :( Think I'll stick to apt-get and aptitude in future despite the warnings on the wiki!
[01:37] <khaije1> Maintech: which how-to are you using?
[01:37] <atarinox> bruenig: sorry, but i was already installing through the gui when you sent me that 2nd command, did use your link from the how-to for hte package though.
[01:37] <Maintech> khaije1, I think I've tried them all...
[01:37] <Plecebo> looking at gdm log now one second
[01:37] <bruenig> atarinox, that link I sent you was all command line based also
[01:38] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : ok, same here... "switching off" works, but "switching back" fails, is that what you mean?
[01:38] <atarinox> yeah but when i entered the command from the how-to i got an error message
[01:38] <mc_> !pastebin > Plecebo
[01:39] <sizzam> is there another repo where i can get the beta nvidia driver?   amaranth's is not working at the moment
[01:39] <bruenig> atarinox, did you copy and paste or try to type it because there are 3 pages of comments there and no reports of errors
[01:39] <khaije1> Maintech: half the battle is finding the right how-to :-) I'll see if i can find one and we can go through it
[01:39] <atarinox> bruenig: copy + paste
[01:40] <SAM_theman> anyone here has every gotten their Ati 7000 to work or their hp deskjet 3653
[01:40] <bruenig> atarinox, ok, well whatever it is. If you copy and paste that command up there, it won't interfere with anything. Just delete everything you downloaded and copy and paste that command. That is the easiest way to do it
[01:40] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: switching into a non-beryl login is fine,, switching back to my beryl login once the screensaver has kicked in never seems to work.
[01:40] <netminder3335> hello, if there is anyone that can help me, i am having trouble setting up a workgroup in order to share a printer
[01:40] <atarinox> bruenig: error message sent in pm
[01:40] <bruenig> atarinox, I got no pm
[01:40] <khaije1> Maintech: what typeof gpu do you have?
[01:40] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : have you been successful at switching back into a non-beryl login after screensaver kick-in?
[01:41] <atarinox> is it /msg <usr> <text>
[01:41] <atarinox> ?
[01:41] <Maintech> khaije1, I have a Nvidia GeForce4 440 mmx/SE
[01:41] <Plecebo> mc_: here is my pastebin http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30235/
[01:41] <mc_> atarinox: you must be registered to send private messages
[01:42] <khaije1> Maintech: and are you using edgy or a different ubuntu version?
[01:42] <bruenig> atarinox, did you copy and paste that command in the terminal, and it didn't work?
[01:42] <mc_> Plecebo: is that the whole log?
[01:42] <Plecebo> the whole thing
[01:42] <Maintech> khaije1, Edgy....here is a link to the forum where I posted some stuff:  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=287690
[01:42] <atarinox> bruenig: yes
[01:43] <scamboy> bruenig: hi, good morning(asia).... Q: is it normal 2 hav 2 linux kernel? coz at grub, i can see 2 version of linux 2.16 something and another 1 is an older version...i just update to dapper(not a full update miss out 5 more download coz internet down)...but is it normal 2 have 2 version and 2 recovery at GRUB???
[01:43] <mc_> Plecebo: seems like you have remove some fonts
[01:43] <khaije1> Maintech: cool, i'll check it out
[01:43] <hads> scamboy: Yes
[01:43] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: Only if I kill gnome-screensaver from somewhere else before I switch :)
[01:43] <bruenig> scamboy, those are probably different kernels. If you have updated to other kernels. It will list all of the ones you have and allow you to choose which to boot from. Very normal
[01:43] <Plecebo> mc_ not intentionally, is there an easy way via apt-get to restore them?
[01:43] <mc_> scamboy: you can have as many versions as you please,this is linux everything is possible ;)
[01:44] <mc_> Plecebo: dont remeber tha package name,sorry
[01:44] <scamboy> hads: so its normal..when i update tp edgy it will show 3 kernel??? ok thanks
[01:44] <atarinox> bruenig: damn. well that gui installer completed the install. still crashing
[01:44] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : ok, thanks for the info, I'll report
[01:44] <Plecebo> mc_ thanks i'll look into it
[01:44] <mc_> Plecebo: np
[01:44] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: even then it's a bit of a crapshoot, usually I just switch to tty1 and restart gdm ...
[01:44] <bruenig> atarinox, I am trying the command right now
[01:44] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : wish I could even do that
[01:44] <scamboy> Bruenigs: thanks for the info..i was shock thougt it was all screwed up...hehheeee
=== Justin_ is now known as HentaiXP
[01:45] <atarinox> yeah ill try the 2nd command you gave me...how do i get rid of whatever the gui installer installed?
[01:45] <bruenig> atarinox, I uninstalled and copy and pasted that command. Worked fine.
[01:45] <shwag> The popularity field in the Add/Remove Applications dialog should be improved. Default applications should just say "default" next to them rather then just having 5 stars. Then maybe the rest of the stars can be normalized.
[01:46] <bruenig> shwag, add/remove needs to be gone in general. So slow
[01:46] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: I'm glad I decided to stay on dapper, I'm finding and/or hearing about so many issues in edgy already.
[01:47] <mc_> zcat[1] : i have no problems with edgy
[01:47] <mc_> zcat[1] : it boots up much faster,shuts down faster...
[01:47] <mc_> zcat[1] : xorg with aiglx is nice too
[01:47] <bruenig> those with problems complain about it, those without problems don't really say anything. So you get an unfair representation of how good it really is
[01:47] <zcat[1] > I've just set up edgy on another machine, and I can't switch from gui to text.. I just get a flickering orange mess...
[01:47] <re-align> Which logfile would I check for mouse driver errors?
[01:48] <atarinox> bruenig: about:plugins says i have     File name: libflashplayer.so Shockwave Flash 9.0 d55
[01:48] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : well to me it was way around (apart from the switching issue): my ethernet driver was highly buggy, it kept killing my network card on high load
[01:48] <bruenig> atarinox, that is what you want...
[01:48] <atarinox> still crashing
[01:48] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : it seems to be fixed in 2.6.17
[01:48] <sethk> re-align, usually the X log
[01:48] <kditty> what would the command be to make my 'ath0' wireless card my default connection device? under networking it doesnt save that in prefrences
[01:48] <sethk> re-align, unless you use the mouse in the console and get errors before X starts.
[01:48] <bruenig> atarinox, what do you mean it is crashing?
[01:48] <atarinox> bruenig: any other reason it would be crashing on me?...do i have to restart for my screen bit-depth to take effect
[01:49] <atarinox> bruenig: when i try to load a flash page (such as youtube), the whole browser closes out
[01:49] <bruenig> atarinox, if you changed other stuff. Perhaps that is the problem, I can't say for sure. Generally it is a good idea to do one thing at a time, and then check functionality so as to tell cause and effect
[01:49] <zcat[1] > Although I don't think Verne is going to mind.. as long as yasr works he's going to have no idea what's on the screen anyhow :)
[01:49] <scamboy> atarinox: you are not the first.....5 hours ago they peole talking about it.....including myspce has problemm hehehee
[01:50] <re-align> seethk: The issue  is that it keeeps forgetting my touchpad scrolling settings during the session. It reemembers them on reboot, but tends to forget sometime during a session.
[01:50] <atarinox> bruenig: ok...but if i edit my screen bit-depth, would that change take effect immediately? or would I have to reboot?
[01:50] <bruenig> atarinox, no idea
[01:50] <atarinox> just trying to figure out if im still at 16 or at 24
[01:51] <bruenig> atarinox, I am sure you would have to restart x
[01:51] <zcat[1] > atarinox: probably have to restart X
[01:51] <atarinox> ok..im going to try that
[01:51] <zcat[1] > /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[01:51] <sethk> re-align, check the X log, although I doubt anything in the log will help.  I could be wrong, though, so look
[01:51] <bruenig> ctrl + alt + backspace
[01:51] <zcat[1] > or ctrl-alt-backspace
[01:51] <scamboy> he is gone..
[01:51] <bruenig> wow, we should have just told him that earlier
[01:52] <w00> does GAIM auto SSL or is there a package to install?
[01:52] <scamboy> zzzzzz
[01:52] <bruenig> he asks for help, I give him a simple command to copy and paste and he comes back 5 minutes later telling me the gui way he is doing it is crashing
[01:52] <sarixe> how do i get midi to work everywhere?
[01:52] <sarixe> including in java?
[01:52] <shwag> bruenig: I think Add/Remove works pretty good. Whats the problem?
[01:53] <scamboy> add/remove good...hmn....
[01:53] <bruenig> shwag, probably just some elitism on my part. It is so slow to startup. I can get what I need plus another 2 packages before it loads up by just firing off the terminal
[01:53] <re-align> Also, I'm having some issue with the keyboard, it tends to repeat letters whether I want it to or not. Adjusting the rate setting doesn't seem to fix the problem.
[01:54] <scamboy> re-align:change ur keyboard..
[01:54] <sethk> re-align, USB keyboard?
[01:54] <re-align> scamboy, difficult to do  on a laptop...
[01:54] <SAM_theman> http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6670805775943228421&q=borat
[01:54] <SAM_theman> LOL
[01:54] <scamboy> realign: oppssss...
[01:55] <barnetod> anyone use beryl here?
[01:55] <atarinox> bruenig: awesome, that worked. thanks a ton
[01:55] <highneko> me
[01:55] <bruenig> !beryl | barnetod
[01:55] <ubotu> barnetod: beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[01:55] <barnetod> sethk anjuta is nice by the way :)
[01:55] <zcat[1] > barnetod: yeah
[01:55] <highneko> barnetod: I use bearl.
[01:55] <khaije1> Maintech: i think i see your issue, it sounds tricky
[01:55] <noiesmo> barnetod, yep
[01:55] <scamboy> re-align: i think its a driver problem....
[01:55] <sethk> barnetod, I think it's a good ide.
[01:55] <barnetod> those with beryl you ever drag cursor down to the bottom
[01:55] <barnetod> and get a panoramic view?
[01:55] <axisys> can I use ZFS w/ dapper drake?
[01:55] <barnetod> of 3 windows
[01:56] <zcat[1] > barnetod: first thing I switched off.. cant remember where the option is, but it's in there somewhere
[01:56] <barnetod> im trying to find it
[01:56] <highneko> barnetod: scale?
[01:56] <sarixe> i need help setting up MIDI
[01:56] <TLE_02> How do i get info off my system like processor type and graphics card name and such ?
[01:56] <sarixe> any help to get this working?
[01:56] <sethk> TLE_02, the info is in /sys.  lspci lists everything on your pci bus
[01:57] <sethk> kde has a program to list out all of your hardware.  Gnome probably does as well.
[01:57] <shwag> bruenig: yah, but in Add/Remove you can spend an hour looking through what programs are offered and test out new stuff.
[01:57] <zcat[1] > barnetod: you probably wan to get rid of the 'genie' effect minimising windows too..
[01:57] <sethk> TLE_02, from the command line, you use lspci, lsusb, etc.
[01:57] <TLE_02> sethk: thanks
[01:58] <welly> hey, how can i completely (and I mean completely and utterly!) remove the apache2 installation?
[01:58] <sarixe> anybody get MIDI to work?
[01:58] <bruenig> shwag, that is why I said it is probably some elitism on my part. Generally I am aware of most applications so it is not very helpful. For new users being able to wade through a bunch of apps especially if you are unfamiliar is probably very nice.
[01:58] <barnetod> yeah a little bit
[01:58] <zcat[1] > the default settings for beryl are (imho) pretty sucky
[01:58] <barnetod> im trying to figure out this thing
[01:58] <sarixe> i can't get MIDI to work at all
[01:58] <sarixe> it's so frustrating
[01:58] <Maintech> khaije1, ok...I'm listening.
[01:59] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : sorry once more but did you say that the switch issue happened on dapper just as well?
[01:59] <Grife> I need to unpack rar files but xarchiver doesn't do it
[01:59] <HymnToLife> !rar
[01:59] <ubotu> rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[01:59] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: I'm using dapper, haven't upgraded.
[01:59] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : ok
[02:00] <Grife> thanks a lot, will look into it
[02:00] <khaije1> i'm still looking but whats the result of this command glxinfo | grep render
[02:00] <khaije1> opps
[02:00] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: dapper with backports, the probablem may be a backported package....
[02:00] <khaije1> Maintech: ^^
[02:00] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : but you didn't get backport of gnome-screensaver did you?
[02:00] <yungknight> how do i load the firmware for my wireless card? i have a "bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed." i now have the .fw files using the bcmxx fwcutter
[02:01] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: no idea... anyone know how to check what version I have and where it came from?
[02:01] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : dpkg -l gnome-screensaver
[02:01] <barnetod> zcat got rid of genie effect
[02:02] <barnetod> thank god lol now trying the panorama crapola
[02:02] <zcat[1] > ii  gnome-screensaver            2.14.3-0ubuntu1              a screen saver and locker   -- doesn't say what repo it came from though :(
[02:02] <Rappermas> ok, i have the nvidia drivers back, but beryl broke
[02:03] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : yeah but that's from dapper
[02:03] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : you can tell from packages.ubuntu.com
[02:03] <zcat[1] > cool...
[02:03] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : edgy uses 2.16
[02:03] <atarinox> is there an alternative to openoffice? something which isnt such a resource hog
[02:03] <toeknee> vi
[02:03] <mc_> atarinox: softmaker
[02:03] <toeknee> :)
[02:04] <zcat[1] > cosmodad: So is the bug in screensaver or beryl or xgl?
[02:04] <mc_> atarinox: emacs
[02:04] <yungknight> how do i load the firmware for my wireless card? i have a "bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed." i now have the .fw files using the bcmxx fwcutter
[02:04] <toeknee> what is the genie effect you speak of?
[02:04] <atarinox> mc_: emacs for word processing?
[02:04] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : I must correct, dapper uses 2.14.1, you might have some backport of gnome-screensaver
[02:04] <mc_> atarinox: emacs for everything
[02:04] <cosmodad> zcat[1] : since I don't use beryl/xgl, it has to be in the screensaver
[02:04] <mc_> atarinox: even for taking over the world and for brewing coffee
[02:04] <Lone> Hey, I have a question... how do you access an app not showing in the Applications tab?
[02:04] <sarixe> HOW DO I GET MIDI TO WORK????????????????
[02:04] <shwag> bruenig: if you sit down at a fresh ubuntu install, what are the programs you would install first?
[02:05] <mc_> Lone: alt+tab
[02:05] <zcat[1] > sarixe: I DON'T KNOW!!
[02:05] <toeknee> whereis program_name
[02:05] <sarixe> ok.
[02:05] <variant> Lone: type the name of it in a terminal or press alt f2 to get the run dialog and type the namethere
[02:05] <sarixe> i've tried this in Kubuntu
[02:05] <sarixe> it's really annoying
[02:05] <sarixe> i can get timidity to work fine
[02:05] <mc_> oh i misunterstood his question..
[02:05] <zcat[1] > sarixe: I could never get it to work consistently.. I once got it barely working using timidity++, but it was all too much hassle.
[02:05] <sarixe> ok
[02:05] <variant> Lone: bareing in mind htat it has to be the name of the executable not thename of the program, as these can differ
[02:05] <barnetod> I found it :)
[02:06] <mc_> does someone in here have mainactor ,is it good?
[02:06] <bruenig> shwag, generally, I enable the extra repos. Install xchat, all of the codecs and non free stuff I need including plugins and the like. Then that is about it. I wine utorrent. So i have to set that up. But that is essentially it except setting up my preferences and tweaking the system configuration
[02:06] <sarixe> yeah, i got it working in timidity, but it won't work in java, for example, runescape.
[02:06] <zcat[1] > sarixe: find a card that has hardware midi... that seems to work :)
[02:06] <sarixe> lol
[02:06] <yungknight> does anyone know where i have to load the firmware for a devide? i have a "bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed." i now have the .fw files using the bcmxx fwcutter
[02:06] <toeknee> or you can try automatix to get midi working
[02:06] <sarixe> alright, i'm out then
[02:06] <sarixe> c ya
[02:06] <sarixe> automatix?
[02:06] <sarixe> does that have midi stuff?
[02:06] <linux_n00bie> helP ;-(   I'am trying to set the right resolution
[02:06] <mc_> yungknight: hav you already googled for the name of your device and linux?
[02:06] <lostinc> Are there any apps web based or not that are used for tracking addresses and such other than Evolution which I dislike.
[02:06] <variant> toeknee: what does automatix have to do with midi?
[02:06] <Lone> variant: how do i find out the name of t he executable?
[02:07] <toeknee> yeah, www.getautomatix.com
[02:07] <HymnToLife> !midi
[02:07] <ubotu> Trouble playing midi files? Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MidiSoftwareSynthesisHowTo
[02:07] <sarixe> i have automatix
[02:07] <HymnToLife> !automatix
[02:07] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[02:07] <sarixe> oo
[02:07] <zcat[1] > toeknee: and break everything else ? :)
[02:07] <toeknee> lol
[02:07] <mc_> yungknight: "$application_name linux"
[02:07] <atarinox> what about AbiWord as a word processor?
[02:07] <toeknee> i use it and it works great
[02:07] <mc_> atarinox: its nice,but now half as powerfull als oo
[02:07] <variant> !automatix | sarixe
[02:07] <ubotu> sarixe: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[02:07] <sarixe> k
[02:08] <toeknee> suite yourself
[02:08] <toeknee> the new one is nice
[02:08] <atarinox> mc_: is it fast? for a slower laptop?
[02:08] <toeknee> automatix2
[02:08] <yungknight> mc_, : i just want to load the firmware, i've googled enough about scioflags error, i am trying to solve it
[02:08] <variant> atarinox: it is fairly fat, compared to oofice, its lightening
[02:08] <zcat[1] > Lots of people like automatix and/or easyubuntu.. but when it screws up it can be a real pain to fix again..
[02:08] <mc_> atarinox: its MUCH faster than oofice
[02:08] <variant> atarinox: but it misses some features
[02:08] <Lone> variant: how do you find out the name of an executabl? what is the executable name of bittorrent?
[02:09] <mc_> atarinox: if you want to spend some money you can try softmaker ,its also very fast and has much more features
[02:09] <barnetod> is there any reason I wouldn't be allowed to create folders?

[02:11] <Lone> toeknee: oops

[02:11] <barnetod> no option
[02:11] <toeknee> Lone: you just trying to download torrents?
[02:11] <TIger_IT> barnetod: maybe you want to make a "folder" (directory) where U cant becuse you ve no permissions
[02:11] <Lone> toeknee: yup
[02:11] <barnetod> i went to extract a tarball
[02:12] <mc_> roadrunn1r: you should not build your own kernel
[02:12] <barnetod> i cant add folders to usr/local?
[02:12] <toeknee> well what if you just download the torrent and let it open with the default app?
[02:12] <mc_> got2sleep, good night guys
[02:12] <roadrunn1r> mc_: i always build my own kernel because i know my hardware and it needs less ram.
[02:12] <sethk> barnetod, you can, but you have to be root to do so
[02:12] <Arrick> Anyone here able to help finish the configuration of a pastebot that was written in perl, thats running on Ubuntu breezy? the only issue I have left is the one where the bot has the dropdown box, where you choose the channel it pastes the link into.
[02:13] <TIger_IT> barnetod: no as a simple user
[02:13] <toeknee> Lone: I like www.scrapetorrent.com
[02:13] <barnetod> not as admin?
[02:13] <Arrick> the dropdown box currently has only (none) in it
[02:13] <TIger_IT> barnetod: but as root using sudo... U can do it
[02:13] <mc_> barnetod: admin is called root under unix
[02:13] <milionar> aaaa
[02:13] <Arrick> mc_, I thought that was called superuser?
[02:13] <Lone> Is there any way to add a program that isn't under the Applications tab to the Applications tab?
[02:13] <Arrick> hence sudo
[02:13] <TGPO> roadrunn1r, you copy over your old config?
[02:14] <mc_> Arrick: its called both
[02:14] <Arrick> Lone, create a shortcut
[02:14] <variant> barnetod: sudo -i will make you the root user (think administrator) and you can do anything hten
[02:14] <TIger_IT> barnetod: just do: sudo konqueror (or nautils)
[02:14] <Arrick> mc_, I know, just puchin buttons
[02:14] <variant> Lone: create a .desktop file for it
[02:14] <variant> Lone: forget that
[02:14] <vladuz976> anybody know how i can convert wmv movies into flash and .mov ?
[02:15] <barnetod> let me see if this works :)
[02:15] <roadrunn1r> TGPO: no i downloaded the the vanilla sources and enabled/disabled what i need. with other distris i didn't had any problems ... the kernel self is running but not the init scripts. :( btw no kernel panic. seems to be that the init scripts are not found.
[02:15] <killown> anyone know which driver of webcam creaty?
[02:15] <TIger_IT> sudo -i    is like su ?
[02:15] <barnetod> whats the command to log out of root
[02:15] <roadrunn1r> barnetod: strg+d or logout
[02:15] <skelter> Arrick: it's "sudo" as short for su, switch user, not superuser. and if you do "su" with no user name, it assumes root
[02:15] <sethk> TIger_IT, right, only you don't even need to know a second password.
[02:15] <sethk> barnetod, exit
[02:15] <Lone> arrick: how do i do that? yes, i'm a noob
[02:15] <Arrick> ahh skelter thanks
[02:16] <noiesmo> vladuz976, you could use menecoder but I dont have the syntax for wmv to flash or mov I do have on for flv to avi
[02:16] <TGPO> roadrunn1r, you need to copy over the old config, thre are some setting that ubuntu has changed, like removing the inittab
[02:16] <noiesmo> on/one
[02:16] <TIger_IT> sethk:  Cool!! because I dont konw the root pass ! :)
[02:16] <redguy> I am going to change my hard drive, since in edgy fstab has uuids inside I am not sure what to change in fstab after the switching the hard drives. Is pasting the output of uuidgen /dev/thenewpartitions into the fstab sufficient?
[02:16] <skelter> there is no root password, by default
[02:16] <roadrunn1r> TGPO: thx i guess thats it. :)
[02:16] <Arrick> Lone, I dont normally play with ubuntu and I am a *few* distros behind, so point that to the whole channel please
[02:16] <skelter> you should prefix administration stuff with sudo
[02:16] <toeknee> anybody running Edgy tonight?
[02:16] <redguy> skelter: wrong, the root password is locked by default

[02:17] <killown> anyone know driver for webcam creaty?
[02:17] <TIger_IT> Lone:  ln -s
[02:17] <TGPO> toeknee  no probs installing
[02:17] <skelter> redguy: hmm, i'm wondering what the difference is, but i guess it doesn't matter
[02:17] <m2c4d> Will I have to reconfigure CUPS if I upgrade to Edgy?
[02:17] <milionar> je tu nejaky cech/slovak ?
[02:17] <TIger_IT> Lone: man ln  :)
[02:17] <toeknee> im still on dapper, and its great but not sure if I want to try upgrading or fresh install
[02:17] <Lone> TIger_IT: man ln?
[02:17] <re-align> I had a few problems upgrading from Dapper...but I just attribute most of those to my old system being a pest...
[02:17] <redguy> skelter: you can't login as root (through getty and such)
[02:18] <skelter> oh, i didn't mean it was an empty password
[02:18] <TIger_IT> Lone: yes... MANual
[02:18] <skelter> i just meant you couldn't use root
[02:18] <m2c4d> Lone: look at the man-page for ln
[02:18] <skelter> i misspoke
[02:18] <TIger_IT> skelter:  me too!!!
[02:18] <Xaphoo> toeknee: from my experience, I tried an upgrade and it messed things up (small things, but still annoying), and then I did a fresh install and it was great.
[02:18] <Lone> TIger_IT: thanks.. excuse my nubness
[02:18] <TGPO> skelter 'sudo su' fakes it pretty well
[02:18] <skelter> heh
[02:18] <Daverocks> Xaphoo: i think there's a build of ET for linux, but don't know if it's "easy to install" :P

[02:23] <Danny> hold 1 sec
[02:24] <Flosoft> yes, openssh-server was installed
[02:24] <Flosoft> and it worked before
[02:24] <mc_> Flosoft: does /etc/init.d/ssh start work?
[02:24] <Danny> my sound card
[02:24] <Danny> is

[02:25] <Flosoft> maybe telnet?
[02:25] <toeknee> Flusoft: nope telnet not enabled
[02:25] <halex-ab> Flosoft, unless you have telnet installed on the machine (by default no), then don't count on it..
[02:25] <mc_> Flosoft: just try to start sshd,telnet is evil

[02:26] <mc_> Flosoft: oh sorry,i did not understand you
[02:26] <milionar> is that line i see in the middle of the screen just for comprehension or does it have some special meaning?
[02:26] <Danny> my sound card is Realtek ALC 882,
[02:26] <mc_> Flosoft: hm that sucks,do you have some kind of wed-administration tool linstalled?

[02:26] <Flosoft> that is a great thought!
[02:26] <w00> does GAIM come installed with SSL automatically or is there a package to install?
[02:27] <linux_n00bie> can anybody see me?

[02:27] <halex-ab> milionar, just means it was where you changed the window focus, shows you where you were up to reading..
[02:27] <Flosoft> so I am sure to have access via that to the command line

[02:28] <mc_> Flosoft: or you could write a very small script that restarts sshd in case of a crash
[02:28] <Flosoft> 2ssh's?
[02:28] <Flosoft> well ... I am not even sure that it is sshd

[02:37] <Flosoft> should I get dapper or edgy for the server?
[02:37] <jordan> bruenig: Obviously not because that is currently set to firefox.
[02:38] <HymnToLife> Flosoft, I'd go with Dapper
[02:38] <Flosoft> ok
[02:38] <paulb_> flosoft, its more polished
[02:38] <Maintech> I'm thinking about going BACK to Dapper.
[02:38] <Sylfaen> hello , thanks again for helping regarding mounting drives, i have another question, how to install some windows softwares, etc. dreamweaver and photoshop?
[02:38] <Flosoft> ok
[02:38] <halex-ab> Plus, it's LTS..
[02:38] <chapium> I havent had much trouble with edgy
[02:38] <bruenig> jordan, that is what the faq says. I had problems at the very end of my dapper usage where it would only open in the terminal browser. But when I upgraded to edgy it was back to behaving
[02:38] <chapium> i'm guessing i'm in the minority
[02:38] <Brian111> anyone have a clue?
[02:38] <sabu> hmmm got some serious lag/ jerkiness in the displays
[02:39] <scamboy> !wine|sylfaen
[02:39] <ubotu> sylfaen: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[02:39] <paulb_> maintech, Amen
[02:39] <bruenig> chapium, you are in the silent majority

[02:40] <Indigo42> hey all, im working on installing fglrx, following http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=291464 that guide, however, i ran automatix, and for some reason VMware is interfering with the installation, I tried to remove it with automatix, however i get an error, is there another way to remove it?
[02:41] <milionar> where can i get that "automatix" is it some package?
[02:41] <variant> milionar: it is best avoided
[02:41] <jordan> !automatix
[02:41] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.

[02:41] <Maintech> Indigo42, there is a website for Automatix that has command line for removing it.

[02:41] <john64> i am also working with FGLRX, but i am using wiki.cchtml.com and it seems that DRI isnt working for me, even though i have the composite extension disabled

[02:41] <Indigo42> Maintech, thanks, ill take a look
[02:41] <Brian111> alright here is the story: the light is flashing now on the wireless card but iwlist scan or other commands bring up nothing
[02:42] <sb> hello
[02:42] <john64> my module installs and is probed perfectly
[02:42] <milionar> message from ubotu seems so encouraging :)
[02:42] <Maintech> Indigo42, I wouldn't use it for anything but installing codecs for video/audio..
[02:42] <john64> wiki.cchtml.com has an excellent guide
[02:43] <john64> it worked perfectly for me on dapper, its just that edgy doesn't seem to like fglrx
[02:43] <Maintech> bbiab....
[02:43] <milionar> !mplayer
[02:43] <ubotu> mplayer is a media player. Enable multiverse repo and type sudo apt-get install mplayer for more info please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer  To compile it from source see:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer/Compile
[02:43] <ubotu> For Codecs try !codecs Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MplayerInstallHowto for installation tips.

[02:45] <john64> how does one ensure DRI is working properly?

[02:47] <john64> jordan: how did you fix FGLRX in edgy???
[02:47] <jordan> john64: Open your xorg.conf and add this at the bottom:
[02:47] <jordan> Section "Extensions"
[02:47] <jordan>         Option      "Composite" "0"
[02:47] <jordan> EndSection
[02:47] <john64> i have that
[02:47] <john64> i have also tried "false" and "Disable".  it worked once
[02:47] <overflow> I upgraded from Drake boot now it doesn't boot... removing the quiet grub option and the boot freeze  at init-bottom
[02:47] <halex-ab> sabu, no, not by default I don't think, but I have it under preferences, can't remember if I installed it or not..

[02:53] <Daverocks> Brian111: what's the problem with the network card?
[02:53] <wastrel> i have radeon 9600 mobile ... but i don't use cedega
[02:53] <halex-ab> milionar, OK, just install the mplayer-firefox package..
[02:54] <jordan> john64: That should mean it is working, in what way is it not working.
[02:54] <kabeljauw> i just tested it in bzflag and it looks horrible

[02:57] <Brian111> it has a password... just WEP not wpa
[02:57] <Daverocks> Brian111: is it your network?
[02:57] <Brian111> i manually downloaded network-manager from another pc and all the dependencies because i have no itnernet at all on teh laptop
[02:57] <kabeljauw> oh ok :)
[02:57] <Brian111> yeah
[02:57] <Brian111> one is
[02:57] <faddatp> bunch of reasons, but basically because I don't feel like compiling everything on the planet

[03:03] <zcat[1] > he'll be back soon enough if it's not up :)
[03:03] <wastrel> what do you mean config it in the firewall?  like what ports to open?
[03:03] <HymnToLife> adrenaline, you might want to have a try at Firestarter for easy firewall tweaking
[03:03] <tannerld> I upgraded my laptop to edgy, but when I log-in I don't see my desktop/panel/icons or anything.
[03:03] <adrenaline> HymnToLife, can you point me there?
[03:04] <john64> jordan, i just copied the "Extentions" block right from the ubuntu wiki page, and it doesnt affect anything
[03:04] <atarinox> how do i create a /home folder on my desktop?...similar to windows
[03:04] <HymnToLife> adrenaline, sudo apt-get install firestarter :)
[03:04] <wastrel> john64:  what card now?
[03:04] <john64> drag the icon from places to the desktop
[03:04] <john64> Radeon X1800XT
[03:04] <HymnToLife> atarinox, your desktop is in your home folder
[03:04] <HymnToLife> not the other way around ;)
[03:04] <adrenaline> HymnToLife, I already have ipchains
[03:05] <zcat[1] > atarinox: alt-F2 and type "ln -s ~ Desktop" would probably work

[03:06] <pixelmonkey> With an ipw3945 wireless card on Edgy, I'm experiencing the issue that in order to get my wireless card to start up and be available in iwconfig, I need to disable and re-enable the wireless switch on my laptop.  Is there a way I can avoid this?

[03:07] <barnetod> well i cant install adobe reader
[03:07] <barnetod> because i cannot write a damn folder anywhere
[03:07] <jordan> john64: A catch all fix would be to try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg and then add the extentions section again.
[03:07] <pixelmonkey> barnetod, I recommend getting automatix to install applications like adobe reader for you.
[03:07] <adrenaline> How do I stop iptables
[03:07] <wastrel> barnetod:  by default you basically only have write access in your home dir and in temp directories.

[03:09] <wastrel> just use synaptic or aptitude or apt-get or whatever kde uses

[03:12] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[03:12] <jordan> john64: Did you try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ?
[03:12] <sethk> Plecebo, probably the vert freq is higher than your monitor can handle
[03:12] <john64> jordan: no, after would i redo aticonfig?
[03:12] <barnetod> i promise im not completely helpless
[03:12] <wastrel> john64:  i get that same aiglx error... my 3d is satisfactory tho i'm not a gamer.
[03:13] <jordan> john64: No, it does that automatically.
[03:13] <Plecebo> sethk: it was working for a few weeks, pretty sure the configs are still ok
[03:13] <barnetod> lol i atleast installed wireless and aiglx :)

[03:18] <sethk> Plecebo, you don't want to use ranges like that.  ranges tell your X server to chose the vertical frequency.
[03:18] <zmo> and tuxguitar is automatically removed
[03:18] <zmo> and btw
[03:18] <Daverocks> bulmer: i'm assuming the interface is already up, but it can't really do anything if it's not associated
[03:18] <zmo> there's a weird thing that just happened
[03:18] <zcat[1] > and anyhow, it worked...
[03:18] <sethk> Plecebo, that may not be your problem, but that's what your symptoms sound like, and it's easy to check
[03:18] <zmo> shift + backspace just killed my X !
[03:18] <sethk> Plecebo, as I said, your X log file will tell you what resolutions and freq's are in use.
[03:19] <Daverocks> bulmer: anyway, from my experience i haven't been able to set the essid when there's an encryption key on, so "iwconfig wlan0 key off" might do something
[03:19] <zcat[1] > fould out why textmode was busted, it seems usplash doesn't bother resetting the screen or something. No splash in by grub.conf and I can use the text consoles again.

[03:31] <Danny> it mutes headphone not PCM
[03:31] <Danny> yes
[03:31] <Danny> on the keybaord
[03:31] <zmo> Danny - ok, then change where I told you to PCM not Headphones
[03:31] <Danny> were do I chage in
[03:31] <Danny> in right click spekrer
[03:31] <halex-ab> zmo, Yes, but there's a known bug in GNOME that ignores the settings in the Volume preferences applet..
[03:32] <halex-ab> Me thinks that's the issue..
[03:32] <zmo> halex-ab - it was in dapper
[03:32] <shiv> firefox does not open links of windows mediaplayer even though the mplayer plugin is installed. Any help?
[03:32] <halex-ab> Still broken on my Edgy..
[03:32] <zmo> halex-ab - that's why there's a list of what channel you want in the preference
[03:32] <Danny> were do i make it so mute buton mutes pcm
[03:32] <zmo> as far as I've read from launchpad
[03:32] <roler> I just got a new video camera, and before I go out and buy a firewire wire, does ubuntu support firewire/video importing?
[03:32] <halex-ab> welly, the bug is actually in GNOME's bugzilla..
[03:32] <halex-ab> well*
[03:33] <zmo> halex-ab - indeed :)
[03:33] <Xaphoo> how do I change the default program nautilus uses to open a file type?
[03:33] <zmo> but I said launchpad as one would say "a coke" for a pepsi ;)
[03:33] <wastrel> if the bug is in the volume applet, will alsamixer work?
[03:33] <john64> jordan:  i just found this in my X Log (**) Extension "Composite" is disabled
[03:33] <zmo> wastrel - the problem is with the gnome shortcut to the sound control buttons
[03:33] <john64> yet I still have abysmal performance
[03:34] <zmo> I think something should be added to the control panel just for those buttons
[03:34] <bclough> Hi all, I can't remember entering a root password when I installed Ubuntu!!!  Does this mean it has not been setup yet?  I have a user (main user), but don't i need root access to do some things?
[03:34] <zmo> instead of making it a voodoo feature
[03:34] <DarkMageZ> john64, could you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[03:34] <hosler> Is there anyway I can keep my atheros wifi card working without linux-restricted-modules, or am I going to have to download the madwifi drivers?
[03:34] <zmo> bclough - indeed, you don't have a root password
[03:34] <zmo> bclough - and sudo is your friend
[03:35] <rbil> bclough: the first user you created gains root privileges using sudo or gksudo
[03:35] <Danny> so what happend zmo?
[03:35] <RedLance> So what do I need to change so that I don't have to run wine with sudo?
[03:35] <john64> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1206
[03:35] <sethk> bclough, if you take the default (desktop) install, you aren't prompted for a root password.  for the other install options, you generally are prompted for root.
[03:35] <Plecebo> sethk: rebooting now *fingers crossed*
[03:35] <john64> DarkMageZ: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1206
[03:36] <john64> DarkMageZ: that was on line 53
[03:36] <zmo> Danny - well, if what I told you does not work, you'll have to configure yourself a hotkeys manager, and if you're really a newbie, it won't be easy to install :)
[03:36] <Vaske_Car> how to set RealPlayer as default player?
[03:36] <sethk> Plecebo, ok.  if it doesn't work, then you've at least eliminated one possible issue.  make sure you check the X log to see what resolutions it is actually using.
[03:36] <barnetod> ugh real player
[03:36] <halex-ab> mmm, xbindkeys.. lol
[03:36] <adrenaline> how do I get gui network browsing to work in ubuntu
[03:36] <zmo> halex-ab - indeed
[03:36] <Danny> well i have no idea waht u said
[03:36] <Brennan> does anyone know what the least amount of RAM u need for the server
[03:36] <Danny> b/c the text is moving to fast
[03:36] <zmo> Danny - google for xbindkeys
[03:36] <calamari> on boot it's saying that I have nvidia kernel module version 1.0-8776 but that x mod is only version 1.0-8762.  How can I get a match?
[03:37] <zmo> calamari - wrong link for libGl-something in /usr/lib
[03:37] <cashmoney> ahh I found the error
[03:37] <cashmoney> is it alright to paste it, or should I use pastebin?
[03:37] <nahoj> pastebin
[03:37] <Vaske_Car> Where Edgy manage default applications, how to change them?
[03:37] <DarkMageZ> john64, also could you pastebin /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[03:37] <bclough> rbil: so is there a way to set up a "root" with a password still?
[03:38] <sethk> cashmoney, if it's three lines or fewer you can paste
[03:38] <zmo> you must have installed mesalib after nvidia modules
[03:38] <bclough> thanks for your help guys :)
[03:38] <Danny> zmo can u PM me
[03:38] <zmo> Danny - well, I'm gonna go to bed
[03:38] <cashmoney> ahh let me connect on the laptop
[03:38] <zmo> it's almost 4am
[03:38] <cashmoney> brb
[03:38] <zmo> sorry
[03:38] <sethk> bclough, you already have root.  you can set the password, yes.
[03:38] <sizzam> Vaske_Car: System > Preferences > Preferred Applications
[03:38] <Danny> it will tke 2 sec
[03:38] <zmo> Danny - just reread what I said
[03:38] <Danny> ok
[03:38] <zcat[1] > sethk: three lines? I try never to paste anything that won't fit in one :)
[03:38] <Xaphoo> how do I change the default program nautilus uses to open a file type?
[03:38] <sizzam> Vaske_Car: also, you can rightclick on any file and choose properties, then the Open With tab, that will set the default for that filetype
[03:38] <john64> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1207\
[03:39] <hosler> Is there anyway I can keep my atheros wifi card working without linux-restricted-modules, or am I going to have to download the madwifi drivers?
[03:39] <bclough> sethk: ahhh, well for some reason i cannot paste fonts that i dl'd into /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf
[03:39] <john64> DarkMageZ: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1207
[03:39] <sizzam> Xaphoo: you can rightclick on any file and choose properties, then the Open With tab, that will set the default for that filetype
[03:39] <Brennan> wut is the least amount of RAM need for the server
[03:39] <bclough> sethk: sorta just figured this was the problem...but perhaps not
[03:39] <Vaske_Car> sizzam, how do I start RealPlayer from terminal?
[03:39] <zmo> ok gn all
[03:39] <sethk> bclough, probably you don't have write access there.  try it as root or with sudo
[03:39] <calamari> zmo: thanks!
[03:39] <Xaphoo> oh ok thanks
[03:39] <sizzam> Vaske_Car: i don't know the answer to that one
[03:40] <Plecebo> sethk: same behavior, and it is using the correct resolutions from the xorg.0.log file
[03:40] <Danny> zmo i dont get wat u sent me
[03:40] <Danny> i got a sound prblem not a keybarod problem
[03:40] <sethk> Plecebo, ok.  try getting rid of the highest resolution, and see if you see the login screen then.
[03:40] <sethk> Plecebo, what resolution is it using, by the way?
[03:40] <Brennan> wut is the least amount of RAM need for the server
[03:40] <sethk> Plecebo, what resolution/vert freq?
[03:41] <Plecebo> 1280x1024 which is the resolution for my monitor
[03:41] <Plecebo> @60hz
[03:41] <zcat[1] > Brennan: I don't think there's any absolute limit. Generally it sucks with less than 128M and I don't think you can boot at all with less than 64
[03:41] <bclough> sethk: ahhh!!  sorry im so new to ubuntu...not sure what sudo is... I was a fedora user and used "YUM" to do everything
[03:41] <rbil> bclough: using a couple of Nautilus scripts you can easily edit files that require root privs or make nautilus launch with root privs ... find out how here:  http://customdesign.homelinux.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=43
[03:41] <bclough> rbil: thx!
[03:41] <sethk> Plecebo, see what happens at 1024x768.
[03:41] <Brennan> yeah b/c I have an old system with 32
[03:42] <Danny> I NEED HELP
[03:42] <Danny> arg
[03:42] <sethk> bclough, you can use dpkg in ubuntu to do everything you did with yum in fedora.  there is no significant difference in what can be done, and at what level.
[03:42] <Danny> i am copletly lost
[03:42] <sethk> bclough, sudo is a program used at the command line to run a command with root privileges
[03:42] <bclough> sethk: great! will do
[03:42] <jordan> !sudo | bclough
[03:42] <DarkMageZ> john64, what does glxinfo spit out?
[03:42] <ubotu> bclough: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:42] <zcat[1] > Brennan: nice doorstop. You should get yourself a computer someday :)
[03:42] <bclough> awesome thanks so much for you kind and gentle help :)
[03:43] <Brennan> yeah I know I got it for free and was trying to do something with it
[03:43] <john64> DarkMageZ: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1209
[03:44] <zcat[1] > there are some really cut down distros that might be OK... but I'n not sure even xubuntu would run well on that amount of ram.
[03:44] <zmo> Danny - your problem is that you mute key does not control the right channel, so it's not a sound problem, it's a hotkey problem, that has consequence on the sound. Use your brain, Luke.
[03:44] <zmo> gn
[03:44] <zmo> ++
[03:44] <jordan> john64: That error is normall, that extra section in your xorg.conf is what disables composite

[03:44] <DarkMageZ> john64, what test are you doing to benchmark?
[03:45] <arturs> es ir kruts! :D
[03:45] <khaije1> Brennan: you need a micro distro such as DSL or puppy
[03:45] <calamari> Brennan: what speed is that machine?
[03:45] <Brennan> 100MHz
[03:45] <Plecebo> sethk: same behavior,
[03:45] <arturs> wo ho ho hoooo
[03:45] <bclough> sure is busy in here!
[03:45] <bclough> guess this is the linux that is happenin !!!
[03:46] <calamari> Brennan: I put plain Debian on a p133 but it has 96mb of ram
[03:46] <Brennan> 98 was running on it
[03:46] <sethk> Plecebo, hmm.  the X log shows no errors, and it thinks it is waiting for you to log in?
[03:46] <jordan> john64: So you already did the dpkg-reconfigure, correct?
[03:46] <sethk> Plecebo, are you sure gdm isn't aborting?
[03:46] <john64> jordan: yep, i did

[03:46] <jordan> john64: And after that added the extentions section again?
[03:47] <Brennan> ok
[03:47] <Brennan> ill try it
[03:47] <john64> jordan: double check, my logs even show that composite is disabled
[03:47] <Brennan> I was trying to find 98
[03:47] <arturs> pizdu
[03:47] <john64> jordan: #(**) Extension "Composite" is disabled
[03:47] <Plecebo> sethk: there are some errors at the end of the xorg.conf about fonts, and i'm not sure that gdm is not causing the problem
[03:47] <calamari> 95 would be better than 98 for that thing, hehe
[03:48] <Danny> any on that can help me out with my problem pls IM me on AIM=deathredsky22
[03:48] <sethk> Plecebo, you mean the X log, right, not xorg.conf.  Can you put the log file up on the paste bin?
[03:48] <sethk> Plecebo, paste web site?
[03:48] <jordan> john64: I believe you, I just have been away for a while and wanted to be sure I knew where you were at.
[03:48] <DarkMageZ> john64, http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1210 i added 3 lines down the bottom, add them to /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[03:49] <Plecebo> sethk: sure give me a second
[03:49] <Plecebo> sethk: i did mean the x log not the config
[03:49] <RedLance> How do I initially run bastille, I got it installed with apt-get but now what?
[03:49] <lumpa> I am having difficulties getting sound to work with VMware 5.5 in Edgy eft (Using Alsa OSS) Could someone help me figure out how to get it to work? Thank you!

[03:50] <Danny> ok

[03:53] <DarkMageZ> john64, glxgears is not a benchmarking tool. try playing a game
[03:53] <cashmoney> and I get a dri error some something like that
[03:53] <Plecebo> sethk: yea
[03:53] <john64> i know, xmoto is still laggy
[03:53] <Plecebo> sethk: they are both exactly the same

[03:53] <millk> cashmoney, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory
[03:53] <jordan> cashmoney: Have you installed the graphics drivers for your card?
[03:54] <Plecebo> sethk: yea thats how it usually is (or has been for me since i set it up)
[03:54] <sethk> Plecebo, what do you mean by "both exactly the same"?  same monitor?  same behavior?
[03:54] <john64> DarkMageZ: Everything is still very laggy,  especially screensavers
[03:54] <Plecebo> sethk: same monitor
[03:54] <DarkMageZ> john64, i'm out of ideas. sorry
[03:54] <sethk> Plecebo, the errors at the end don't mean anything important
[03:54] <Plecebo> sethk: sorry, the same hardware... so same resolution and vert synch
[03:54] <DarkMageZ> john64, if you do get it working, please msg me how :)
[03:54] <Plecebo> sethk: thats what I thought

[03:54] <john64> sure will!
[03:55] <cashmoney> jordan: yes I have
[03:55] <sethk> Plecebo, do you lose the display on both monitors?  I'm talking about using both monitors at the same time, by the way.
[03:55] <cashmoney> I have an ati radeon all-in-wonder 9600
[03:55] <jordan> cashmoney: what is the output of: glxinfo | grep direct ?
[03:55] <barnetod> anyone had synaptic lock up your screen
[03:56] <sethk> Plecebo, you might try disabling dpms.
[03:56] <Plecebo> sethk: when i attempt to login after i enter the password and push enter the screen goes black on both monitors and i see a blinking cursor on both monitors then the login (gdm?) comes up again
[03:56] <sethk> Plecebo, oh, that's entirely different than what I thought you said your problem was
[03:56] <sethk> Plecebo, that's your X server failing to start, and gdm restarting.

[04:16] <morgue> Hey, I'm trying to install quake 3 demo, but when I run sudo ./linuxq3ademo-1.11-6.x86.gz.sh -target /tmp/q3 I get sudo: ./linuxq3ademo-1.11-6.x86.gz.sh: command not found
[04:16] <SpacePuppy> morgue: put sh in front of that instead of ./
[04:16] <Arrick> ok guys and gals, after using synaptic package manager to install openssh-server
[04:16] <SpacePuppy> and a space
[04:16] <Arrick> how do I start it?
[04:17] <jbroome> Arrick: it should have started after it installed
[04:18] <Arrick> it didnt, or how do I restart it after I add users to that group?
[04:18] <henrique> eit
[04:18] <jbroome> /etc/init.d/sshd restart
[04:18] <henrique> exit
[04:18] <jbroome> guess 3rd time was the charm
[04:19] <Arrick> nope, jbroome it is /etc/init.d/ssh still for some reason
[04:19] <cashmoney> is there a way to compile vlc for video codecs?
[04:19] <Arrick> and it fails to start jbroome

[04:28] <LjL> rbil: former is possibly easier, really :P
[04:28] <sabu> just trying to get some help

[04:29] <rammy> anyone got monodevelop 0.12 to work with 6.10 edgy
[04:29] <dutchy> if i'd like to use the external harddrive im going to buy in both windows or linux, which filesystem should i use, fat32 or ext* (ie. does fat have a better implementation on linux or ext* a better implementation on windows) ?
[04:29] <sabu> Rookie_, how is that done?
[04:29] <threw> rammy: use eclipse instead :-p
[04:29] <BHSPitLappy> dutchy, FAT32, but it has crappy limits.
[04:29] <BHSPitLappy> there's really no GOOD solution
[04:30] <rammy> downloaded rpm ran dpkg converted to deb file and installed but crashes on edgy
[04:30] <BHSPitLappy> I think there's a 2GB file max
[04:30] <rbil> dutchy: if you're going ot be hooking that up with other Windoze boxes, that don't have a special driver to work with ext3, then FAT32 is probably your best bet
[04:30] <knix> I'm having an issue with video playback on Xubuntu/Edgy w/ 945gm video, I can't play fullscreen at all, and if I make it large enough in window mode (not very large) performance drops to unusable. This is an edgy specific issue, I had no problems with dapper or debian-sid
[04:30] <Rookie_> sabu copy this; sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:30] <dutchy> rbil: just with my own, i can install any drivers i'd like
[04:31] <sabu> Rookie_, thanks man
[04:31] <BHSPitLappy> rbil, or, if it's more for windows, you could go NTFS and then install ntfs-3g on the linux box
[04:31] <rbil> dutchy: well then go ext3. much better file system
[04:31] <Arrick> ok, so anyone have any idea why openssh-server isnt working on a ubuntu breezy box, the box refuses the connection
[04:31] <Arrick> doesnt get to the login part
[04:31] <Rockj> Hey guys :) I'm having some trouble installing Edgy with netboot as the installer can't seem to find the necessary files on any of the repos. Anyone know any ways around this?
[04:31] <Rookie_> !upgrade
[04:31] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[04:32] <Rookie_> dont use boots to upgrade, use the internal programs
[04:33] <kzt> Hi everyone! Does anyone know how to move the calendar in evolution from the left sidebar to the right?
[04:33] <Rockj> If you're talking to me I wasn't really planning on doing an upgrade, I was planning to do a fresh install
[04:33] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: how can anything be "more for windoze"? Anyone using Ubuntu will choose to run that more often than Windoze and will eventually drop Windoze all together.
[04:33] <Rockj> And don't have CD-ROM-drive, nor a floppy disk in my computer
[04:33] <BHSPitLappy> rbil, I meant if you're primarily using it for use with windows.
[04:34] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: I know what you meant. But that "primarily" won't last that long. :-)
[04:34] <BHSPitLappy> that's kind of naive of a thought.
[04:35] <Rookie_> every system is good at something - even winlose
[04:35] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: been my experience. Most people I communicate with, who have become familiar with GNU/Linux eventually drop Windoze altogether.
[04:36] <Lynch`> how do I connect to a wireless network using ubuntu?
[04:36] <dutchy> its for storage like mp3's anyway
[04:36] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: admittedly, I don't know many gamers, which is what that toy operating system is good for.
[04:36] <BHSPitLappy> rbil, I would, but then I'd lose some core, sometimes-necessary features.
[04:36] <dutchy> yeah i only use it for games
[04:37] <dutchy> absolutely nothing else
[04:37] <sabu> Rookie_, ran that and programs arent opening, IE- tryed to test it by opening planet penguin racer and I get a flash of it oening then it disappears
[04:37] <BHSPitLappy> and I'm not a PC gamer.
[04:37] <wastrel> ubunto
[04:37] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: a vm is the obvious answer for that
[04:37] <Dowey> can i please borrow a few minutes of someones time
[04:37] <BHSPitLappy> rbil, completely incorrect. (for what I'm referring to)
[04:38] <dutchy> Dowey: however polite it may be, dont bother to 'ask to ask' :)
[04:38] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: curious, what core are you referring to? I just haven't seen it.
[04:38] <Rookie_> sabu - dpkg is just a configuration tool ... not a prog .. after you have run that you have to restart the X server
[04:38] <bruenig> !ask
[04:38] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:38] <sabu> k, Ill just reboot then
[04:38] <sabu> thanks
[04:38] <Dowey> ok sorry, i just need help mounting my cd burner i have googled everything and i still cant do it
[04:38] <BHSPitLappy> rbil, sometimes I need to make a dial-up connection on this thing.
[04:39] <Rookie_> sabu no need to reboot, just press alt+ctrl+backspace
[04:39] <bruenig> Dowey, it doesn't automatically mount when you put a disc in it?
[04:39] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: and you are going to dual-boot to accomplish that "core" task?
[04:39] <Dowey> no i cant explain it, unless its a bad batch of disks
[04:39] <Dowey> it does if it is a regular disk but not blank
[04:39] <BHSPitLappy> rbil, derr, I guess I can live without a connection when it's absolutely essential.
[04:40] <BHSPitLappy> for the sake of patting myself on the back for being a linux purist
[04:40] <dutchy> so anyway, i'd use the harddisk for being able to access my shares on both OS'es and share them (im in a huge samba network) 2GB file size limit is troublesome (6 GB dvd game iso's etc) so i guess ill go for ext3
[04:40] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: don't use dialup, but surely GNU/Linux can handle that old task?
[04:40] <Lard-O-Lad> im running the dapper livecd, and i cannot seem to get usbnet working, can someone help me?
[04:40] <BHSPitLappy> rbil, unfortunately not. almost all modern modems you'll find in computers are WinModems
[04:41] <motin_> how can I prevent my system to automount my usb hard drive? (trying to change it's partition table)
[04:41] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: then buy a usr robotics REAL external modem on ebay. Geez. Keeping NTFS around and Windoze just for dialup is a bit sily. imho.
[04:41] <Dowey> bruenig: so do you know what i can do
[04:42] <Lynch`> how do I connect to a wireless network using ubuntu?
[04:42] <BHSPitLappy> so, the answer is to spend money because linux is lacking?
[04:42] <dutchy> !wireless
[04:42] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[04:42] <BHSPitLappy> sorry, this is getting way too offtopic for this channel. I'm not continuing the conversation any longer.
[04:42] <feross> motin_: System>Preferences>Removable Media...
[04:42] <Lynch`> ty
[04:42] <rbil> BHSPitLappy: $10 sure beats keeping that toy operating system around. But maybe that's just me?
[04:42] <motin_> feross: aha thanks!
[04:43] <sabu> nothing that has to do wit h3d opens now
[04:43] <anjo> BHSPitLappy, imo, the netwook manager applet is the "best" for configuring wireless
[04:43] <sabu> 3d rather
[04:43] <feross> Lynch`: I REALLY like NetworkManager for WIFI.. especially when switching between networks frequently or for WPA
[04:43] <bruenig> Dowey, check your fstab to see what it has for your cdrom

[04:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about glxinfo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:44] <anjo> Lynch`,  imo, the network manager applet is the "best" for configuring wireless in 6.1
[04:44] <sabu> event not found
[04:44] <Lynch`> feross: im not connected to internet at all atm, its a desktop lacking a network card due to some curious friends
[04:44] <Lynch`> all i have is the wireless card

[04:45] <iami89> do you know how to install wine?
[04:45] <Dowey> does that llok ok?
[04:45] <bruenig> Dowey, right well theoretically, you should be able to just do a mount /dev/hdd but if it wasn't recognizing your blank disc it will just say no medium found I believe
[04:45] <anjo> Questionj: wi use edgy 6.1, gnome desktop, why do all my non native apps look like this ?

[04:48] <Dowey> does that look better?
[04:49] <bruenig> rammy, .12 is in the repos, you probably should look like that
[04:49] <poningru> rammy: why are you taking the rpm and converting to deb? why not just use the ubuntu deb?
[04:49] <Rockj> Ok, gonna do my last bump for the night, noone knows anythinga bout the nic-restricted-thingamajig that couldnt be found during the install?
[04:49] <BHSPitLappy> anjo, what the heck?
[04:49] <Rookie_> sabu - sorry, been on a forum and havent followed what you said ... hope any other can help you ....
[04:49] <bruenig> Dowey, your line should look like this. I am not sure this will solve your problem but, /dev/hdd        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
[04:50] <rammy> hmm i couldn't find the reposiorities mutliverse sp and so decided to get the rpm and convert it to  deb.
[04:50] <bruenig> rammy, you have to enabled the extra repos, have you done that?
[04:50] <sabu> hope so too
[04:50] <Dowey> bruenig, that is what it looks like
[04:50] <rammy> now after installling it crashes. I would like deinstall but dpkg -r doesn't seem to work
[04:50] <Rookie_> forums can be better on that way ppl can answer when they have time ...
[04:50] <rammy> and reinstall it from synaptic
[04:50] <sabu> can anyone spend a few minutes with me on this nvidia problem please
[04:51] <jrib> rammy: pastebin and remember that alien'ing an rpm is usually not the best solution for next time
[04:51] <rammy> oh well my fault for not using synpatic or apt
[04:51] <anjo> !nvidia
[04:51] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:51] <sabu> that is out of date for 6.10
[04:51] <MacAnthony> can some one help me with an ndiswrapper issue?
[04:51] <rammy> jrib my advice to anyone is not to use alien unless they really have to
[04:51] <dax> I need help installing metacity.  I downloaded and extracted the tar.gz, now what do I do?
[04:52] <bruenig> rammy, my advice is to not use rpms when the repos have the same version in deb
[04:52] <jrib> dax: why? metacity is in ubuntu by default
[04:52] <dax> oh
[04:52] <anjo> just ask your questions, don't expect someone to volunteer to be your helper ..
[04:52] <Dowey> bruenig, it looks like ubuntu doesnt recognize it as a cd burner
[04:52] <bruenig> Dowey, ok, well try this command then. sudo mount /dev/hdd /media/cdrom0"
[04:52] <jbroome> hahahahahah
[04:52] <anjo> if someone knows the answer, they will.
[04:52] <dax> :(
[04:52] <dax> thanks
[04:52] <jrib> dax: metacity is the default window manager in gnome
[04:52] <dax> ohhh
[04:53] <rammy> bruenig when i used synaptic under list of ALL files  i couldn't find monodevelop.
[04:53] <bruenig> rammy, right, well multiverse has it...
[04:53] <rammy> so I followed desktop guide and got the rpm
[04:53] <jrib> universe*
[04:53] <MacAnthony> I have installed and setup ndiswrapper and when I do an ndiswrapper -l, all seems to be fine but I still don't get a wlan interface
[04:53] <krkrkrkr> where to find linux h4x0r toolz???
[04:53] <bruenig> unless you don't have edgy
[04:53] <rammy> and used alien
[04:53] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, sudo modprobe ndiswrapper ?
[04:53] <Dowey> bruenig, i get this "mount: you must specify the filesystem type"

[04:58] <bruenig> Dowey, ask in here again. I can't imagine what the problem is.
[04:58] <krkrkrkr> can someone help please?????
[04:58] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, not sure how to help you, either, but are you SURE you must resort to ndiswrapper? it's really better to figure out a linux native driver
[04:58] <dax> how do I use GTK themes?
[04:58] <Rookie_> krkrkrkr - write them ?
[04:58] <BHSPitLappy> what type of chipset is it, MacAnthony

[04:59] <Rookie_> hp_ - klicka p detta #ubuntu-se
[04:59] <rbil> {Malice}: have you checked settings in your BIOS to turn this off?
[04:59] <gtmr`98-laptop> how do i format my hard drive with ubuntu on it?
[04:59] <BHSPitLappy> krkrkrkr, have you tried gwled? that's a fun game
[04:59] <scamboy> say ubuntu for human being
[04:59] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: it's a trendnet pci wireless card - not exactly sure of the chipset but I coudl get it
[04:59] <hp_> thanks
[04:59] <hp_> tack
[05:00] <krkrkrkr> whats that, BHSPitLappy?
[05:00] <krkrkrkr> are you a hacker?
[05:00] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, type lspci, and try to find the line that talks about your card. (but don't paste all of it in here!)
[05:00] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: AFAIK there is no linux driver
[05:00] <bruenig> gtmr`98-laptop, probably the easiest way is to get the ubuntu live cd, and then install from it using the option to clear the entire hard drive
[05:00] <scamboy> !format|gtmR
[05:00] <ubotu> gtmR: Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[05:00] <anjo> MacAnthony, type lscpi -Vv in a terminal window to view chipset details
[05:00] <anjo> lol.. oops :-)
[05:00] <{Malice}> rbil: It worked before when I have the older version of ubuntu installed would it have messed with the bios with the new install?
[05:00] <gtmr`98-laptop> well, i have ubuntu on my computer, and nothing else i need to get rid of it since im selling my computer
[05:01] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, if it makes you feel any better, I've had bad experiences with Trendnet's products in the past... (oh, wait, how would that make you feel better...)
[05:01] <bruenig> gtmr`98-laptop, are you saying you want to format the hard drive to remove ubuntu?
[05:01] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: it worked fine in Breezy but I just updated to Edgy
[05:01] <rbil> {Malice}: shouldn't have touched the BIOS, but maybe something in Dapper was over-riding BIOS setting and that isn't happening in Edgy? I don't know, Don't use latter nor have this prob.
[05:01] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, really need to know the chipset.
[05:01] <MacAnthony> I know
[05:01] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: I'm working on it :)
[05:01] <knix> Somehow my direct rendering got disabled on my 945gm graphics, and I have no idea how, I didn't touch anything, anyone know how I can get it reinabled? dri and everything seem fine in my xorg.conf
[05:01] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, so did you type the command...
[05:02] <anjo> any idea why my non Linux apps look like this ? - http://img218.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotputtyconfigurxc1.png
[05:02] <gtmr`98-laptop> yes that is what i am saying
[05:02] <bruenig> gtmr`98-laptop, I would put the live cd in. Once it loads up go to System>Administration>Gnome Partition Editor, then just delete all of the partitions and then apply changes
[05:02] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: yes and I got command not foudn
[05:02] <{Malice}> rbil: k

[05:02] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, lspci         as in, L S P C I but lowercase
[05:02] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: yes
[05:02] <bruenig> gtmr`98-laptop, I don't believe you will be able to do it without a live cd, certainly not easily
[05:02] <Trae> how can I make sure I have the latest nvidia drivers for Edgy?
[05:02] <MacAnthony> oh wait
[05:03] <MacAnthony> anjo typed lscpi :o
[05:03] <BHSPitLappy> heh
[05:03] <morgue> does anybody know how to install the quake 3 demo?
[05:03] <mole_> Just upgraded from dapper to edgy - now if I sudo aptitude dist-upgrade, aptitude wants to remove a bunch of packages, including ones like gconf, gnome-bin, libgnome32 which seems to me to be fairly critical to the system?  Any ideas what is going on?
[05:03] <BHSPitLappy> anjo, you're really not paying attention at all tonight :)
[05:04] <anjo> no, i'm not much help. sry :-(
[05:04] <scamboy> !downgrade|mole
[05:04] <ubotu> mole: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[05:04] <BHSPitLappy> same with upgrading, though ;)
[05:04] <Trae> What is the latest driver version for nvida on Ubuntu?
[05:05] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: looks like a Marvell 88w8335
[05:05] <BHSPitLappy> never heard of marvell
[05:05] <Trae> nvida-settings for me says: 1.0-8776
[05:05] <mole_> sorry scamboy, but it was an upgrade dapper --> edgy using the approved method
[05:05] <MacAnthony> neither have I
[05:05] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: that looks like the only wireless card in the list though
[05:05] <scamboy> mole:opps..
[05:06] <Arrick_Sleeping> anjo, wastrel the files are there when I look through the filebrowser, but they have red x icons on them
[05:06] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: but as I said, this worked like a champ in breezy
[05:06] <khaije1> there were rumors recently that intel might buy marvell
[05:07] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, looks  like you do have to use ndiswrapper
[05:07] <ParaMouthBalls> Hello everyone
[05:07] <knix> Somehow my direct rendering got disabled on my 945gm graphics, and I have no idea how, I didn't touch anything, anyone know how I can get it reinabled? dri and everything seem fine in my xorg.conf
[05:07] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, does the system have wired access for the time being?
[05:07] <MacAnthony> no
[05:07] <BHSPitLappy> ouch
[05:07] <wastrel> Arrick_Sleeping:  how were you trying to start the ssh server?
[05:07] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: it has a wired nic, but no way to get cable where it's at
[05:07] <slavik> any idea why X would crash and then when restarted by GDM, it doesn't crash ...
[05:08] <Arrick_Sleeping> wastrel, yes

[05:11] <Arrick> avista, reinstall everything
[05:11] <avista> no
[05:11] <avista> thats not an option
[05:11] <khaije1> are there major differences in the server kernel that make it any less suited for desktop use?
[05:11] <avista> lol
[05:11] <Joblo> I have linux on an external HD and i wanted to plug it into a friend's computer, run my linux on it... his computer *can* boot from usb. Of course, he doesnt have grub, but whatever, i have a grub boot cd anyway. However, it doesnt work! I get error 12, even though it does list ubuntu as one of the possible devices. It just wont load it :(
[05:11] <avista> i need data off that disk
[05:11] <Arrick> vista does *not* like having its partitions messed with
[05:11] <slavik> khaije1: afaik, no ...
[05:11] <jrib> Arrick: your pastebin doesn't have sudo, do you get the same error when using sudo?
[05:11] <wastrel> Arrick_Sleeping:  looks good, you're using sudo, i dunno  - i recommend removing openssh-server with --purge and reinstalling... :/
[05:11] <avista> i'm aware
[05:11] <avista> lol

[05:12] <slavik> khaije1: server install doesn't have kde/gnome by default
[05:12] <Arrick> jrib, yep
[05:12] <s|k> someone should change the ubuntu.com homepage so the server edition download link points to this page:
[05:12] <s|k> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily/current/
[05:12] <avista> i can fix everything in one way
[05:12] <s|k> and not the regular download page
[05:12] <slavik> s|k: launchpad
=== rmulliga is now known as RyanTMulligan
[05:12] <avista> if I can somehow direct grub to hda5/Windows/system32/winload.exe
[05:12] <avista> any way to do that
[05:12] <khaije1> Arrick were you answering my question?
[05:12] <avista> i think the partition is fine
[05:12] <PinkFloyd> Could someone help me configure my network on Edgy with a LAN connection?
[05:12] <avista> tbh
[05:13] <PinkFloyd> Id like to get that computer connected to the Net

[05:13] <Joblo> I also tried setting my external to the primary boot slot, and it worked - and then gave me error 25 :(
[05:13] <PinkFloyd> I already did that
[05:13] <avista> hellooo

[05:14] <PinkFloyd> Anyways
[05:14] <Arrick_Sleeping> it went through nothing
[05:14] <avista> why not
[05:14] <PinkFloyd> I booted up after upgrading to Edgy
[05:15] <jrib> Arrick_Sleeping: yeah, purge the package and reinstall it.  it should have created taht user
[05:15] <PinkFloyd> Then I remembered that I forgot to put the card in
[05:15] <PinkFloyd> So the network card WAS NOT present during installation
[05:15] <scamboy> pink: pcmia??
[05:15] <avista> this is rediculous
[05:15] <Arrick_Sleeping> can I get the exact syntax for that, I really dont want to mess up my other stuff on the box jrb
[05:15] <Joblo> no help? oy :<
[05:15] <avista> if I can't get help here then where
[05:15] <PinkFloyd> pcmia?
[05:15] <Arrick_Sleeping> jrib, ^
[05:15] <PinkFloyd> It's a PCI card
[05:16] <Adam_G> Hi all. I ran dist-upgrade (on a different computer) and it chugged along for several hours until I got an error severe enough to get the bug reporting popup. I ran dist-upgrade again and now it lists all kinds of dependency problems. What can I do? Should I restart? Do I risk data loss if I do?
[05:16] <scamboy> !ask|avista
[05:16] <ubotu> avista: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:16] <Arrick_Sleeping> avista, try #windows, thats the issue you are having
[05:16] <Joblo> i did lol
[05:16] <Joblo> oh thats a bot
[05:16] <sethk> Adam_G, restarting won't make things worse
[05:16] <sethk> Adam_G, I don't know how much good it will do, but I don't think it's dangerous
[05:16] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  so the card is seen by the kernel and it's "up" ?
[05:16] <chemmad> pinkfloyd what do you want?
[05:17] <jrib> Arrick_Sleeping: sudo aptitude purge openssh-server && sudo aptitude install openssh-server
[05:17] <Adam_G> ok, thanks sethk, I'll try it out... I'm backing up first to be safe :D
[05:17] <PinkFloyd> It says "Acquiring network address" then after a bit says "Connected to the network"
[05:17] <scamboy> adam_g:try recovery mode..
[05:17] <N0ble> AAARGH.... i just installed edgy onto a thinkpad t20 and the sound stutters anytime I do anything with the laptop... move windows, etc... anyone run into this?
[05:17] <mike1> anyone have a good link for samba set up, I need to get my filesharing up in my local network and it's not working
[05:17] <PinkFloyd> It will receive traffic, but it wont send traffic
[05:17] <sethk> Adam_G, always a good idea
[05:17] <Arrick_Sleeping> thanks jrib
[05:17] <slavik> on bootup, when X starts (gdm logs me in automatically), X dies when GNOME is almost done.
[05:17] <avista> !ask|avista
[05:17] <ubotu> avista: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:17] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  do you have a router or firewall between you and the internet?
[05:17] <avista> i asked the dang question
[05:17] <PinkFloyd> No
[05:17] <PinkFloyd> Direct connection
[05:17] <rga> where it is image splash-screen?
[05:17] <slavik> after gdm restarts X, I get the login screen and after logging in, everything proceeds to load just fine ...
[05:18] <PinkFloyd> Cable modem is the only thing inbetween
[05:18] <knix> can anyone tell me how direct rendering could have got disabled?
[05:18] <wastrel> ok.
[05:18] <avista> how can I get grub to direct to /Windows/system32/winload.exe
[05:18] <beasty> i'm pondering if the nvidia-glx package is broken ?
[05:18] <morgue> does anybody know how to install the quake 3 demo?
[05:18] <slavik> knix: upgraded kernel?
[05:18] <slavik> knix: module not loaded?
[05:18] <knix> slavik: nope, stock edgy kernel, I haven't touched it
[05:18] <qc_> does anyone know if fglrrx is required to run xgl completely correct?
[05:18] <knix> I don't know what modules I need to load =/ I enver loaded any by hand for it before
[05:18] <PinkFloyd> So does anyone have any idea what to do? It acts like it's working fine, but it isnt.
[05:18] <qc_> does anyone know if fglrx is required to run xgl completely correct?
[05:19] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  can you ping 64.233.161.99
[05:19] <mendred> hi has anyone installed audacity on edgy?
[05:19] <scamboy> !grub|avista
[05:19] <ubotu> avista: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[05:19] <slavik> knix: make sure the ati/nvidia module from restricted modules does not load ... I forget where to black list it
[05:19] <PinkFloyd> wastrel, it's not connected right now
[05:19] <PinkFloyd> The LAN Im using now on my WinXP is the one I was testing Ubuntu with
[05:19] <knix> slavik: hrmm I guess that could be it, it's a 945gm chip, not nv/ati
[05:19] <PinkFloyd> Id have to take out the LAN cable and disconnect from here
[05:19] <slavik> oh ... hmm
[05:20] <myke> is there a way to convert dvr-ms files
[05:20] <myke> or .tp / .ts files?
[05:20] <PinkFloyd> I tried connecting to repositories and all that stuff just to make sure Firefox wasnt broke
[05:20] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  trying to figure out if it's a DNS or a connection prob
[05:20] <slavik> knix: what driver does X use? (check in /etc/X11/xorg.conf)
[05:20] <knix> slavik: nope, no nv/ati modules =/
[05:20] <knix> i810
[05:20] <PinkFloyd> It's not the connection
[05:20] <knix> it's what ti was using before when it worked =/
[05:20] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  you can connect to repos?
[05:20] <slavik> is that what is in the xorg.conf?
[05:20] <PinkFloyd> No
[05:20] <wastrel> from edgy?
[05:20] <morgue> I just downloaded linuxq3ademo-1.11-6.x86.gz.sh, how do I install it?
[05:20] <PinkFloyd> Wont let me
[05:20] <wastrel> that's what i mean by connection
[05:20] <wastrel> sry
[05:20] <PinkFloyd> Nah, cant do that
[05:20] <Arrick_Sleeping> jrib, that fixed it thanks
[05:20] <scamboy> pinkFloyd: as i told you, make eth1 default coneection, go to NETWorking, look for the wireless propertise...edit it...use dhcp...good luck..
[05:21] <PinkFloyd> I did
[05:21] <PinkFloyd> Did exactly that
[05:21] <PinkFloyd> Says the connection is fine
[05:21] <PinkFloyd> but it isnt
[05:21] <wastrel> scamboy:  it's not wireless, he said LAN card
[05:21] <PinkFloyd> 100Mbps card
[05:21] <PinkFloyd> Actual speed is about 5Mb down
[05:21] <knix> slavik: It literally just stopped working, I suddenly noticed I couldn't play video, and then found direct rendering was disabled =/ any ideas?
[05:22] <scamboy> pinkFloyd: ok then, make eth0 as default..
[05:22] <PinkFloyd> ....
[05:22] <PinkFloyd> I DID
[05:22] <PinkFloyd> <_<
[05:22] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  so next time you are on linux, try to ping 64.233.161.99
[05:22] <philip_> when is feisty fawn devel going to begin?
[05:22] <Arrick_Sleeping> jrib, in ubuntu breezy whats the easiest way to add a user, and lock him to another users home dir?
[05:22] <PinkFloyd> wastrel, my IP changes everytime it connect
[05:22] <PinkFloyd> It's dynamic
[05:22] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  that will determine if it's DNS or IP
[05:22] <slavik> knix: is i810 is in the xorg.conf?
[05:22] <PinkFloyd> Do I need a DNS server?
[05:22] <myke> anyone?
[05:22] <PinkFloyd> I saw something about DNS server
[05:22] <Arrick_Sleeping> adn then allow him ssh connection, with ability to sudo too jrib
[05:22] <knix> slavik: yes
[05:22] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  your DNS addresses are always the same, they're your ISP's  yes dns server are necessary
[05:23] <scamboy> PinkFloyd: you will see a network icon on the right top ...click twice....chage lo to eth0..
[05:23] <linux_newbie6> hello
[05:23] <slavik> knix: lsmod | grep i810
[05:23] <Linuturk> updated from Dapper to Edgy. the FF icons look good on the launcher, but the task panel and the workspace show the original generic icons
[05:23] <PinkFloyd> So I need to add a DNS server?
[05:23] <slavik> that give you anything?
[05:23] <scamboy> hello newbiE
[05:23] <wastrel> preferably 2
[05:23] <mole_> morgue: you need to chmod u+x linuxq3....sh to make it executable, then run ./linuxq3...sh
[05:23] <jrib> Arrick_Sleeping: you can't really lock a user to another user's home directory if that user has sudo
[05:23] <JoaoJoao> hello
[05:23] <scamboy> hi
[05:23] <linux_newbie6> thanks scamboy
[05:23] <scamboy> welcome
[05:23] <Arrick_Sleeping> ok jrib how about just adding another user that can sudo and also ssh?
[05:23] <PinkFloyd> So I need to add a DNS server?
[05:24] <JoaoJoao> anyone knows how to make Xen work with Edgy?
[05:24] <scamboy> Pink...does't matter
[05:24] <PinkFloyd> Ok
[05:24] <PinkFloyd> So make sure eth0 is default, again
[05:24] <morgue> mole_, $ chmod u+x linuxq3ademo-1.11-6.x86.gz.sh ?
[05:24] <JoaoJoao> (With the stuff given in the repository that is)
[05:24] <scamboy> !xen
[05:24] <ubotu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy
[05:24] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  yes, you will needat least 1 dns server address in your network config
[05:24] <JoaoJoao> I tried that
[05:24] <knix> slavik: bah, wasn't loaded, sec trynig now
[05:24] <linux_newbie6> this sound like a stupid question
[05:24] <JoaoJoao> but then GRUB tells me "Cannot mount partition"
[05:24] <PinkFloyd> So do I add a DNS or will it add by itself?
[05:24] <mole_> morgue, that looks right - just make sure it's in your home dir
[05:24] <jrib> Arrick_Sleeping: just create another user with 'adduser' (or system > administration > users and groups).  As long as you havne't placed any restrictions in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config, he should be able to ssh
[05:24] <knix> slavik: still no direct rendering =/
[05:24] <avagant> Throw your rosesssss..
[05:25] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  write down the ones you're using in windows and use those on linux also
[05:25] <morgue> mole_, I have the file on my desktop, should I move it?
[05:25] <tapas> i wonder whether i czn
[05:25] <tapas> oops
[05:25] <slavik> knix: restart X ;)
[05:25] <Arrick_Sleeping> ok thanks jrib
[05:25] <PinkFloyd> Where would I find those?
[05:25] <jrib> Arrick_Sleeping: oh and for sudo, you add him to the admin group:  sudo adduser USERNAME admin
[05:25] <MukiEX> Is wine broken in edgy?
[05:25] <slavik> knix: also, do 'sudo depmod'
[05:25] <knix> slavik: I did :P I think the reason I didn't see it loaded was because X wasn't running, hehe
[05:25] <PinkFloyd> In Windows, I just plug in the LAN and go
[05:25] <PinkFloyd> It autoconfigures itself
[05:25] <JoaoJoao> Anyone knows why does this "Cannot mount partition" thing happen?
[05:25] <mole_> morgue, I would suggest moving it to your Home Folder (just cut and paste will do)
[05:25] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  i don't use windows ;]   i think in the control panel, network, ethernet properties or something.
[05:25] <tapas> i wonder how i can disable these volume indicators popups when i use the volume keys on my thinkpad
[05:25] <slavik> JoaoJoao: disk missing?
[05:25] <knix> slavik: agpgart and everything are enabled, drm is loaded as well, and has i810 listed as a dep
[05:25] <JoaoJoao> nope
[05:25] <adrenaline> I think smb browsing is broken in ubuntu
[05:26] <morgue> mole_, so when people say ./asdf they mean /home/asdf ?
[05:26] <linux_newbie6> Im having trouble to change the resolution during install
[05:26] <scamboy> joao: are you on root??
[05:26] <slavik> JoaoJoao: maybe wrong disk or different type of partition ... etc
[05:26] <Daverocks> PinkFloyd: if everything's automatic on windows then it probably uses DHCP ... you can easily have ubuntu auto-obtain IPs with DHCP too
[05:26] <JoaoJoao> I'm running Ubuntu right now,  I can't get running the Xen kernel
[05:26] <tapas> morgue: they mean /home/foobar/asdf
[05:26] <MukiEX> No matter what I do wine keeps giving me unhandled page fault/read access errors.
[05:26] <Adam_G> well, sethk, I have the nice Edgy icons now, and all the important bits are working... :D
[05:27] <Peps> I have a desktop running breezy and a laptop running dapper. is it safe to upgrade yet? is there an update for the installaton CD?
[05:27] <PinkFloyd> Daverocks, I have the eth0 set on DHCP
[05:27] <PinkFloyd> but it still doesnt work
[05:27] <knix> slavik: it's using Mesa GLX Indirect, I'm pretty sure it wasn't using that before
[05:27] <PinkFloyd> It wouldnt go to any pages
[05:27] <PinkFloyd> in Firefox
[05:27] <morgue> mole_, ok i runned chmod u+x linuxq3ademo-1.11-6.x86.gz.sh then sudo sh linu...., now?
[05:27] <mole_> morgue, no, the command ./asdf from the commandline will run the program asdf (as long as it has the executable bit enabled).   What you are doing is changing the file permissions to ensure that the linuxq3...sh file is executable, then running it with ./linuxq3...sh
[05:27] <Daverocks> PinkFloyd: and something like "ping 4.2.2.2" doesn't work either?
[05:27] <JoaoJoao> minute
[05:27] <jrib> morgue: ./asdf means the file asdf in the current directoy, ~/asdf means /home/username/asdf  (usually, since you can change your home directory)
[05:27] <tapas> oops what i said was wrong of course
[05:28] <PinkFloyd> I havent tried ping yet
[05:28] <scamboy> !xen|joao
[05:28] <ubotu> joao: XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy
[05:28] <linux_newbie6> the installion CD will set resolution too low; I cant change to a higher Res; when set too low the text is too
[05:28] <morgue> thanks jrib
[05:28] <adrenaline> any ideas on how to fix smbclient?
[05:28] <mole_> morgue, I wouldn't suggest running the linuxq3 install program as root - ie: sudo not needed
[05:29] <gyaresu> adrenaline, fix?
[05:29] <adrenaline> I can't browse the network anymore on ubuntu
[05:29] <adrenaline> used to work
[05:29] <PinkFloyd> Another question:
[05:29] <linux_newbie6> the text is to big and the window will not shrink dwn
[05:29] <adrenaline> finds no network but the other clients on my network work
[05:29] <scamboy> !resolution
[05:29] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[05:29] <morgue> mole_, heh too late i guess
[05:29] <PinkFloyd> After I installed, it told me to use the command sudo-oem-config-prepare
[05:29] <morgue> mole_, but now is it installed? i don't see it
[05:29] <PinkFloyd> Where do I enter that command?
[05:29] <linux_newbie6> thanks ubotu
[05:30] <PinkFloyd> Terminal?
[05:30] <scamboy> pink: terminal
[05:30] <mole_> morgue, where did you tell the installer to put the program?
[05:30] <Peps> I have a desktop running breezy and a laptop running dapper. is it safe to upgrade yet? is there an update for the installaton CD?
[05:30] <PinkFloyd> Tried
[05:30] <PinkFloyd> It said no such command
[05:30] <morgue> mole_, it didn't ask me
[05:30] <wastrel> PinkFloyd:  it's  sudo oem-config-prepare   (no - after sudo)
[05:30] <PinkFloyd> oh
[05:30] <PinkFloyd> What if I deleted OEM and made my own account already?
[05:30] <PinkFloyd> Do I still need to do that?
[05:31] <gyaresu> adrenaline, do you get anything back from smbtree?
[05:31] <morgue> mole_, got it
[05:31] <mole_> morgue, welldone
[05:31] <morgue> mole_, i isued -target now
[05:31] <PinkFloyd> What if I deleted OEM and made my own account already?
[05:31] <PinkFloyd> Do I still need to do that?
[05:31] <wastrel> oem-config - Perform end-user configuration after initial installation
[05:32] <PinkFloyd> Do I still need to do that?
[05:32] <tapas> ok, are there realtime preemption kernels available for edgy somewhere?
[05:32] <wastrel> i don't think it's really something the user is supposed to do manually, it seems to be part of the install process
[05:32] <morgue> now i have /tmp/q3/
[05:32] <PinkFloyd> Oh
[05:32] <PinkFloyd> So what do I need to do?
[05:32] <morgue> mole_, the file is called setup.sh
[05:32] <PinkFloyd> I deleted the OEM account and made my own account
[05:32] <morgue> sh setup.sh?
[05:32] <wastrel> i suggest you forget about it :] 
[05:32] <scamboy> too bad..
[05:32] <PinkFloyd> Ok >_>
[05:32] <wastrel> if you have a working system
[05:32] <Peps> must I upgrade breezy to dapper first?
[05:32] <mole_> morgue, sounds right
[05:32] <john64> type /msg NickServ IDENTIFY 1q2w3e4r
[05:32] <PinkFloyd> Yeah and I can SUDO also
[05:33] <PinkFloyd> So I think it'll be ok
[05:33] <scamboy> peps:yup!!
[05:33] <Peps> bummer
[05:33] <morgue> mole_, i got setup.sh: 9: function: not found
[05:33] <morgue> x86
[05:33] <PinkFloyd> Ok so Im going offline to try and get my Internet working
[05:33] <adrenaline> gyaresu, asked for a password then told me some error about a printer then went to a promp
[05:33] <PinkFloyd> If it doesnt work, I'll be back ;)
[05:33] <scamboy> GOOD LUCK
[05:33] <john64> jordan, DarkMageZ: If you are there,  i am on a reinstalled version, and the same problem is here
[05:33] <Daverocks> gl PinkFloyd
[05:33] <gyaresu> adrenaline, did you put in the password?
[05:33] <adrenaline> yes went back to a prompt
[05:33] <mole_> morgue, hmmm, give me a minute
[05:33] <indigo42> is there a way to get my sidescroller on my touchpad to work?
[05:33] <gyaresu> adrenaline, 'sudo smbtree'
[05:34] <Peps> has there been an update since the official release to the installation cd?
[05:34] <Zambezi> I'm trying to help a guy running Gnome for the first time (I run IceWM). Where can we find the masterlevel for the sound?
[05:34] <adrenaline> gyaresu, same thing
[05:34] <gyaresu> adrenaline, do you have network connectivity between that machine and any others at the moment?
[05:35] <DarkMageZ> Peps, yeah, about 3-4 packages since the release of the edgy cd
[05:35] <adrenaline> yes I can ping and ssh all over
[05:35] <adrenaline> gyaresu,
[05:35] <kmag> I just updated Dapper to Edgy... anyone know how cryptsetup/dm_crypt has changed ?
[05:35] <gyaresu> Zambezi, alsamixer (from command line)
[05:35] <Zambezi> gyaresu, Thansk alot.

[05:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bugbuddy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:36] <adrenaline> yes but I just want to browse not server gyaresu
[05:36] <MukiEX> Anyone? Wine? Edgy? Broken as hell?
[05:36] <Peps> and is it safer now? i read some advice saying "do not update yet"?
[05:36] <Daverocks> indigo42: i think you can configure that through synclient
[05:36] <adrenaline> I already have a server on my lan gyaresu
[05:36] <preaction> i've got a problem where eth0 is showing up in dmesg, but not in /dev fs
[05:36] <adrenaline> I just want to get to it with my ubuntu box
[05:36] <avagant> what's that bug buddy, bug report thing?
[05:36] <adrenaline> I can get to it with all the other clients gyaresu
[05:37] <gyaresu> adrenaline, so smbstatus comes back with connections?

[05:37] <avagant> but don't we have a bug thing in ubuntu?
[05:37] <adrenaline> sorry about the flood came out bigger here than it was on my server
[05:38] <DanaG> Oh, and I made a nifty script for when snd-hda-intel loads.
[05:38] <gyaresu> adrenaline, what about 'mount -t smbfs //server/share /mnt/point -o username=,password=
[05:38] <john64> i wish they made the Human theme in other colours other than orange
[05:38] <adrenaline> That works gyaresu

[05:38] <Madpilot> avagant, what do you mean by 'a bug thing'?

[05:38] <scamboy> john: me too
[05:38] <john64> ohhh right, i forgot
[05:38] <gyaresu> adrenaline, been messing with any firewall rules?
[05:39] <DanaG> It modprobes it with --ignore-install, then checks for the bogus SPDIF entry, and if it is present, it rmmods and modprobes it (this time letting it run the script again.
[05:39] <john64> but it doesnt make the human icons blue

[05:39] <avagant> ANd how do I get to it, my stupid xmms crashed horribly.
[05:39] <scamboy> spammers!!!
[05:39] <DanaG> XMMS is obsolete.
[05:39] <gyaresu> adrenaline, what are you trying to achieve with amarok?
[05:39] <avagant> THAT explains it
[05:40] <adrenaline> I want to listen to music on my file server
[05:40] <avagant> Amarok is nice, yah.
[05:40] <gyaresu> adrenaline, so why can't you just mount the share?
[05:40] <DarkMageZ> rhythmbox is cool as well :)
[05:40] <adrenaline> it would be nice to drop and drag files too
[05:40] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: I think I got it work
[05:40] <avagant> But I don't want to have download half of kde to get to it.

[05:40] <kads> rhythmbox with audioscrobbling rules
[05:40] <MacAnthony> BHSPitLappy: my ndiswrapper issue that is
[05:40] <adrenaline> it needs to work in the gui for amarok to play it
[05:40] <DanaG> There's a green Human theme, and there are different-color icons, too.
[05:40] <adrenaline> amarok says it can't read the source
[05:40] <kmag> wow... I can't launch any new windows...
[05:40] <DanaG> Oh, and exaile didn't run for me, if I remember correctly.

[05:41] <kads> hey any one if there is 686 version for the linux header in edgy
[05:41] <DanaG> adrenaline: check for codecs.
[05:41] <scamboy> danag: where can get it??which version??
[05:41] <crimsun> DanaG: tried the version from two days ago?
[05:41] <gyaresu> adrenaline, you must be mounting it as root?
[05:41] <DanaG> gnome-look.org
[05:41] <morgue> mole_, no
[05:41] <kmag> new FF, new GAIM, new terminal ... all crash
[05:41] <kads> hey any one know if there is 686 version for the linux header in edgy
[05:41] <avagant> The theme is better for Edgy, it's alot brighter that's for sure.
[05:41] <john64> can you send a link if you have it?
[05:41] <qc_> libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b     -  anyone know how to fix? lol
[05:41] <crimsun> kads: there is not.
[05:41] <scamboy> danaG:tq
[05:41] <DanaG> I need  the folder views, and I don't know if anything else has those.
[05:41] <crimsun> qc_: it's not an error.
[05:41] <avagant> Ahhhh I'm gonna go to the stupid website and find this "bug report" thing that comes with Edgy.
[05:41] <adrenaline> not a codec problem plays locally fine
[05:41] <PinkFloyd> Ok guys
[05:41] <Daverocks> PinkFloyd: ?
[05:41] <PinkFloyd> I can ping my own IP
[05:41] <kads> crimsun can I compile it on my own or it doens't exist atall
[05:41] <adrenaline> not mounting as root either
[05:41] <qc_> crimsun, is it effecting my 3d/xgl experience at all???? lol
[05:41] <PinkFloyd> But I cant ping my server's IP
[05:42] <Daverocks> PinkFloyd: "your own IP" as in 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.x?
[05:42] <crimsun> kads: why would you want 686 headers for a nonexistent 686 image? :)
[05:42] <PinkFloyd> Second one
[05:42] <DanaG> yet another 'yet another' app
[05:42] <gyaresu> adrenaline, do you have a password on the share?
[05:42] <avagant> Rhythm box is ugly.
[05:42] <PinkFloyd> It was actually different
[05:42] <PinkFloyd> But same concept
[05:42] <crimsun> qc_: no
[05:42] <BHSPitLappy> MacAnthony, cool
[05:42] <Daverocks> PinkFloyd: but it's still a non-loopback IP, yeah
[05:42] <john64> Amarok is the best media player,  try that
[05:42] <PinkFloyd> Daverocks, can I query?
[05:42] <adrenaline> gyaresu, no
[05:42] <avagant> I have, I like it.
[05:42] <Daverocks> PinkFloyd: query what?
[05:42] <avagant> It's kinda of clunky looking.
[05:42] <qc_> crimsun,  but i cannot use 3d graphic screensavers included with ubuntu - surely somethings wrong

[05:42] <kads> crimsun I thought they were faster for P4 than 386
[05:43] <avagant> Peoples idea of "themes" is changing like 2 things inside the application.
[05:43] <DanaG> human icon recolors.
[05:43] <adrenaline> it is not a server issue it works on all my other clients just no ubuntu
[05:43] <DanaG> I like the orange, but not the mismatched titlebar.

[05:47] <DanaG> gnome-screensaver sucks.
[05:47] <manudeb> i added :

[05:47] <sizzam> ademan: i agree, i'm not happy about gnome-screensaver at all.   i used to have my box auto-log me in and then fire off the screensaver, but i cant do that anymore either because the daemon doesnt start for like 30 seconds
[05:47] <jrib> DanaG: so use xscreensaver
[05:47] <dax> How do you use a theme engine, I installed it, but how do I use it?

[05:58] <ixian_> it says it wants to uninstall ubuntu-desktop when i try to uninstal totem-mozilla
[05:58] <DanaG> because then Aptitude will go on a merry uninstalling spree.
[05:58] <gyaresu> adrenaline, can you 'ls -l /mnt/music_share' please?
[05:58] <bruenig> DanaG, sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop will have no effect on anything
[05:59] <DanaG> I prefer to use Aptitude.
[05:59] <bruenig> DanaG, you prefer to use something even though it limits your ability to do something
[05:59] <bruenig> when another tool exists that would allow you to do it?
[05:59] <huck> Wont aptitude remove all the dependancies as well?
[06:00] <huck> which might affect other programs?
[06:00] <crimsun> huck: by default, yes, if you only use aptitude. Of course you can disable that.
[06:00] <DanaG> I like using Aptitude because it auto-removes dependencies.
[06:00] <bruenig> DanaG, if you want to just remove ubuntu-desktop and not its dependencies, it will be fine to just use apt-get that once
[06:00] <huck> I usually use apt-get, but lately for installing I've been using aptitude
[06:00] <john64> Thanks for all the help tonight everyone!
[06:01] <manfred22> fuck you
[06:01] <bruenig> you will live belief me, I still am
[06:01] <john64> pardon?
[06:01] <bruenig> believe*
[06:01] <manfred22> no problem i mean
[06:01] <manfred22> sorry
[06:01] <gyaresu> john64, ignore the idiots...
[06:01] <john64> ya, i think that is the topic of the hour!
[06:01] <morgue> mole_, we can go 1on1 if i can install it :)

[06:02] <Glutinous> hi guys, just upgraded to edgy, and it seems the tty* services are running before rcN ones... so what i am getting is the 'login:' followed by some more boot messages. any ideas how to make login: appear last?
[06:02] <DanaG> that issue bugs me too...
[06:03] <Glutinous> i was thinking of modifying ttyN service files to start on rcN
[06:03] <mole_> while we're talking about aptitude, anyone have any insight into my problem?  I recently upgraded dapper --> edgy using the approved method.  Now when I 'sudo aptitude upgrade' aptitude wants to remove packages like gconf, gnome-bin, libgnome32 which seem to be critical packages to me.  Any ideas on what is going on?
[06:03] <DanaG> instead, edit the number in front of the service.
[06:03] <vivabenfica> hi room. need help with wireless configuration for intel wireless pro 3945 abg wireless card
[06:03] <bruenig> apt-get rules...
[06:03] <rga> how to change to image of splash screen?
[06:03] <DanaG> gnome-splashscreen-manager
[06:03] <bruenig> !usplash | rga
[06:03] <ubotu> rga: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[06:04] <DanaG> or do you mean bootsplash?
[06:04] <Varanger> hello!
[06:04] <DanaG> bootsplash > usplash -- I want the nice backgrounds!
[06:04] <huck> mole_: I think the same thing happened to me when I upgraded.. it didn't seem to affect my system at all... but maybe someone with more experience can explain them better
[06:04] <Glutinous> DanaG, edit the numbers in front of the service?
[06:04] <bruenig> apt-get has this autoremove feature in edgy that lets you remove dependencies but doesn't force you to DanaG, have you seen that in edgy?
[06:04] <Varanger> What is the name for GNOME's k3b ???
[06:04] <Glutinous> Varanger, gnomebaker?
[06:04] <DanaG> I haven't looked, frankly.
[06:04] <bruenig> Varanger, well the burning thing most people use is gnomebaker, not sure if that is equivalent to k3b
[06:04] <blazemonger> hello folks
[06:05] <blazemonger> I've been happy with Ubuntu
[06:05] <gyaresu> vivabenfica, How far have you got with it?
[06:05] <blazemonger> despite the few bugs in edgy
[06:05] <Varanger> bluenig: I think it is what I need, I think I have used it before

[06:06] <gyaresu> vivabenfica, have you tried wpa_supplicant?
[06:06] <irobot> should i upgrade my dapper to edgy?
[06:06] <vivabenfica> what is that gy.?
[06:06] <Lone> irobot: word on the grapevine is that it's a pain in the ass
[06:07] <iratsu> how can i set stuff up so i can transfer files to my cell phone via bluetooth on ubuntu?
[06:07] <irobot> lone: thanks.

[06:10] <jkimball4> is there a gui way to configure wpa for wireless
[06:10] <DanaG> jkimball4: install network-manager-gnome
[06:10] <vivabenfica> gyarescu - installing wpa_supplicant
[06:10] <jordan> Oh, it was just trollmaster, great, I guess that is why he is doing it though, to mess with people like me :)
[06:10] <DanaG> if not using ndiswrapper, right?
[06:10] <gyaresu> vivabenfica, cool.
[06:11] <gyaresu> jkimball4, I can help you with a simple script. I'm not a gui man particularly though...
[06:11] <jkimball4> neither am i, but i don't know the appropriate commands to take care of it
[06:11] <vivabenfica> gyaresu - done installing
[06:12] <gyaresu> vivabenfica, I'll just see if I can find what Driver you need to specify. brb.
[06:13] <jkimball4> gyaresu: so how that script
[06:13] <jkimball4> DanaG: how do i use the network manager
[06:13] <jkimball4> DanaG: i see it's a daemon, what about configuration
[06:13] <DanaG> run nm-applet --sm-disable
[06:14] <DanaG> it goes in the Gnome systray.
[06:14] <gyaresu> vivabenfica, jkimball4 so you call wpa_supplicant with some options...
[06:14] <avagant> xmms crashed again, maybe i should get rythmbox
[06:14] <DanaG> (the --sm-disable is there in the startup anyway)
[06:14] <morgue> mole_, any updates?
[06:14] <avagant> oh wait i have it.
[06:14] <john64> i am colourblind,  is azul like blue?  I found the nicest human icon theme in "Azul"
[06:14] <huck> avagant: are you using beryl?
[06:15] <nofxx> azul means blue in portuguese
[06:15] <gyaresu> jkimball4, vivabenfica I make a script  /root/wpa_supplicant.bob
[06:15] <avagant> No I'm just using gnome.
[06:15] <avagant> But I think I'm gonna 86 xmms.
[06:15] <avagant> Cause it just crashed on me after playing for 2 minutes.
[06:15] <DanaG> 86 is a verb?
[06:15] <jkimball4> DanaG:
[06:15] <blazemonger> ubuntu would be better if i had a better video card
[06:15] <jkimball4> DanaG: yep
[06:15] <huck> maybe try reinstalling it? I've had probs too, reinstalling seemed to help
[06:15] <blazemonger> i only have a rage 128 can't run xgl :(
[06:16] <jkimball4> DanaG: it came from the time of prohibition
[06:16] <blazemonger> and my soundcard is only a es1371
[06:16] <blazemonger> no midi
[06:16] <gyaresu> jkimball4, vivabenfica If you call 'wpa_passphrase bob thisismypassphrase' > /etc/wpa_supplicant.bob
[06:16] <avagant> At my old restaurant job people used 86 alot.
[06:16] <DanaG> System audio is on notebook speaker, music and such is on external.

[06:17] <gevaudan82> Hello all...I currently dual boot with edgy and windows xp with grub controlling which devices to boot...how exactly would I reinstall windows xp yet keep grub on the mbr to detect both OSs?  Is there an equivilant to windows xp's fixmbr?

[06:17] <gyaresu> jkimball4, vivabenfica you need to know what driver you card will use with wpa_supplicant then to make the script in /root/ mine is... (hang on vivabenfica i'll describe better)
[06:18] <avagant> Is there a last.fm plugin for rhythmbox? I'll be sold then :D
[06:18] <huck> gevaudan82: supposedly you can reinstall grub from the live cd, but I've never done it
[06:18] <blazemonger> i know i can get one cheap im just lazy when it comes to upgrading
[06:18] <john64> ya
[06:18] <john64> its in there by default, or under the plugins thing

[06:22] <avagant> No wait.
[06:22] <jkimball4> gyaresu: if the network has dhcp, do i still need to run that script?
[06:22] <avagant> How....
[06:22] <jkimball4> gyaresu: at least, everytime as opposed to putting it in a conf file
[06:22] <gyaresu> jkimball4, I run a static IP just for convenience of port forwarding etc.
[06:22] <nofxx> blazemonger brazil goes getting richer as south you go... there are better opportunities in the south.. thats true
[06:23] <nofxx> but in the middle-east is the heart with sao paulo, rio de janeiro and minas gerais states
[06:23] <blazemonger> i also heard it has a very high german population
[06:23] <Tompu> john64: the rhythmbox plugin is only for scrobbling though in the non cvs rhythmbox, right?
[06:23] <gyaresu> jkimball4, vivabenfica check the man page because you can put this stuff in the main wpa_supplicant config file. I just prefer to keep it out as I am on a lot of different networks.
[06:23] <nofxx> blazemonger yes... in south... there are even some small cities that they only speak german.... i heard

[06:31] <dbruno>   Per our conversation...
[06:31] <dbruno>   My sound card is an ISA Cirrus Logic CS-4235 on the IBM300PL
[06:31] <dbruno> motherboard.
[06:31] <dbruno>   Linux treats it as a CS4232.  That's blacklisted in Ubuntu, but an
[06:31] <dbruno> alias is 'snd_cs4232' which is what I used for the definition in
[06:31] <dbruno> '/etc/modules'.
[06:31] <danl> well i want to use mount the directories of System C so i can browse the files from system A
[06:32] <dbruno>   I made a '/etc/modules.conf' file and put in the ports,irq,dma parameters
[06:32] <vivabenfica> gyaresu can i pm?
[06:32] <dbruno> as options but that doesn't work (either).
[06:32] <dbruno>   When I look at dmesg under 'isapnp' it find the card and identifies it
[06:32] <dbruno> as 'Crystal Audio' correctly.  Later it comes back and says:
[06:32] <dbruno> 'CS 4232 - Can't find card ot it's busy', so I assume it's not loading the
[06:32] <dbruno> driver(s).
[06:32] <dbruno>   From my prev w/ RH8, I don't see where the CS4232 is assigned as
[06:32] <gyaresu> !pastebin |dbruno
[06:32] <ubotu> dbruno: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[06:32] <dbruno> sound slot 0 or sound card 0.
[06:32] <dbruno>   Again caution in reading all the on-line advise, this deals w/ kernel 2.6.15
[06:32] <dbruno> as most of the comments apply to older kernels.
[06:32] <dbruno> -H-
[06:32] <gyaresu> vivabenfica, sure
[06:32] <danl> gevaudan82: I currently scp files from c to b... then from b to a... i just want a quicker way
[06:32] <manfred22> drumline_, i think you dont know what you are talking about.. fsck = file system check
[06:32] <gevaudan82> danl: interesting question, but i don't have an anaswer for it unfortunatly...if i was in the same situation i'd probally just create a shell script to do the equivilant
[06:33] <avagant> Are there any cool things I can "do" with rhythmbox or is this the look i got?
[06:33] <manfred22> and that does make a sense!
[06:33] <hp_> i did not find something that can help with my sound
[06:33] <RegalEagle> Anyone help me with my Internet connection in Edgy?
[06:34] <RegalEagle> DHCP enabled, eth0 default
[06:34] <RegalEagle> LAN connection
[06:34] <avagant> Also, is there a way I can set rhythmbox to alsa?
[06:34] <avagant> ifup eth0?
[06:34] <RegalEagle> what?
[06:34] <gyaresu> danl, have you looked at stunnel
[06:34] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: oh yeah, i forgot to ask if the interface is up xD
[06:34] <RegalEagle> ...
[06:34] <dbruno> thank  you gyaresu, but a second or two too late, sorry ;-)
[06:34] <RegalEagle> interface?
[06:34] <avagant> try
[06:34] <huck> hp_: you said you dont have a sound card?
[06:34] <avagant> sudo ifup eth0
[06:34] <RegalEagle> What does that do
[06:34] <avagant> and see if anything happens
[06:35] <avagant> it turns it on.
[06:35] <RegalEagle> Ok, give me a minute
[06:35] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: that brings up the interface
[06:35] <gyaresu> dbruno, :)
[06:35] <hp_> no i did not
[06:35] <BHSPitLappy> drumline_, are you the kid from drumline the movie!
[06:35] <RegalEagle> BBIAM
[06:35] <drumline_> BHSPitLappy: nope.. haven't even seen it.
[06:35] <hp_> i sad that i dont have a sound
[06:35] <tmbg> .
[06:35] <DarkMageZ> avagant, rhythmbox uses gstreamer to play audio. you can set gstreamer to use alsa using  gstreamer-properties
[06:35] <avagant> oh rry.
[06:35] <duane> hey did anyone get an adept updater notification that it wanted to remove nvidia-glx?
[06:35] <huck> hp_: do you have more than one sound card?
[06:35] <gevaudan82> duane: no
[06:36] <BHSPitLappy> drumline_, well, good. it really is quite a repulsive movie, if you're actually a musician
[06:36] <duane> i got it and i dont know why
[06:36] <grant> hey guys went through the guide for installing the nvidia beta drivers, at reboot got this error "Api mismatch: the nvidia kerner module has the version 1.0-7184 but this module has version 1.0-9625" any suggestions?
[06:36] <avagant> Oh that's alright done then, thanks DarkMageZ!
[06:36] <gevaudan82> duane: compatibility with another package maybe? check to see what it wanted to install and you might find an answer
[06:36] <hp_> no only one and i think it is in the mother board
[06:37] <avagant> I set everything alsa, should I unclick allow hardware mixing in sound?
[06:37] <huck> hp_: did you try "alsamixer" in a terminal and see if anything is muted?
[06:37] <RegalEagle> Says "already configured"
[06:37] <osa-> yaaay .. i finally got firefox 2.0 to play video from cnn.com :)
[06:37] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: then it's probably up already
[06:37] <grant> hey guys went through the guide for installing the nvidia beta drivers, at reboot got this error "Api mismatch: the nvidia kerner module has the version 1.0-7184 but this module has version 1.0-9625" any suggestions?
[06:37] <RegalEagle> So is this thing just ****ed up?
[06:37] <gyaresu> grant, you need nvidia-kernel-common
[06:37] <avagant> Hmm.
[06:37] <DanaG> grant: go in Synaptic and lock the restricted-modules to the Amaranth version.
[06:37] <avagant> I don't know how to fix those things, I didn't have any problems with mine.
[06:38] <grant> lock them?
[06:38] <DanaG> Or in Aptitude (no parameters)
[06:38] <nofxx> osa- flash player 9 ? its going sweet with ubuntu?
[06:38] <gyaresu> grant, possibly one other kernel nvidia kernel package.
[06:38] <gevaudan82> osa: what player are you using? i finally gave up and now use vlc in combination with the mediaplayerconnectivity plugin for firefox...i actually like this combination after using it for a while
[06:38] <grant> sorry guys getting conflicting stuff here
[06:38] <drumline_> BHSPitLappy: response in #ubuntu-offtopic
[06:38] <osa-> nofxx: actually, fp9 was choppy for me watching a vid on youtube
[06:38] <manfred22> what is "gnaa"?
[06:38] <grant> gyaresu where should i get that?
[06:38] <hp_> i get this when i type alsamixer hp@ubuntu:~$ alsamixer
[06:38] <osa-> so i went with the nonfree metaverse package
[06:38] <hp_> alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
[06:38] <hp_> hp@ubuntu:~$
[06:38] <rob> manfred22: google it
[06:38] <grant> danag is it lock them or unlock them, how do i do that?
[06:38] <grant> thanks
[06:38] <DanaG> Aptitude or Synaptic?
[06:39] <Daverocks> manfred22: the "gay nigger association of america", an internet trolling organisation
[06:39] <DanaG> In Aptitude, press h for help.
[06:39] <gyaresu> DanaG, grant you will find annoying things with your xorg.conf if you upgrade to the beta drivers. i just reinstalled the edgy version.
[06:39] <RegalEagle> So is my LAN on Linux just ****ed up?
[06:39] <osa-> but firefox 2 installed itself into /opt/firefox .. and
[06:39] <manfred22> wtf, Daverocks?
[06:39] <osa-> ff 1.5.x was in /usr/lib/firefox .. copied the plugins from there to the /opt/firefox dir
[06:39] <Daverocks> manfred22: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America
[06:39] <jkimball4> to checkout software from a svn repo do i have to install the entire subversion package
[06:39] <manfred22> omg...
[06:39] <dbruno> manfred, it actually exists
[06:39] <grant> so you didn't manage to get it working gyaresu?
[06:39] <matthew_w> Any reason why Blender would crash every time I open it?
[06:39] <crimsun> jkimball4: just subversion
[06:39] <RegalEagle> So is my LAN on Linux just ****ed up?
[06:39] <matthew_w> I installed it right from Synaptic
[06:39] <gevaudan82> Daverocks: lol
[06:39] <jkimball4> crimsun: that's what i was afraid of
[06:40] <Daverocks> :P
[06:40] <RegalEagle> So is my LAN on Linux just ****ed up?
[06:40] <gyaresu> grant, oh. no, I did. Beryl was pretty and all but I just downgraded after because it's still buggy (beryl that is)
[06:40] <RegalEagle> >_>
[06:40] <DanaG> gotta 3-finger salute Xorg.
[06:40] <DanaG> Oh, who's having dhcp issues?
[06:40] <gyaresu> RegalEagle, specifics would help...
[06:40] <RegalEagle> me >_>
[06:40] <grant> now how did you know i was trying to get beryl, lol
[06:40] <RegalEagle> Ive already explained it like 4 times
[06:41] <RegalEagle> DHCP enabled, eth0 default
[06:41] <RegalEagle> Edgy says connection fine, but it doesnt work
[06:41] <gyaresu> grant, (preface with my name or i wont see you) Just a wild guess.
[06:41] <DanaG> 2 things to try: make /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf send the right host-name and mac address (copy and paste that one)
[06:41] <RegalEagle> Do what?
[06:41] <Akuma_> newb question: i want to install ubuntu on a second partition, can i trust it to nicely install itself without messing with the current system or should i back up everything?
[06:41] <DanaG> Are you using IP address reservation?
[06:41] <gevaudan82> RegalEagle: can you ping by IP? could be a DNS issue
[06:41] <gyaresu> RegalEagle, If you are talking to someone you need to preface their name.
[06:41] <iratsu> how can i set stuff up so i can transfer files to my cell phone via bluetooth on ubuntu?
[06:41] <dbruno> gyaresu, so this fellow's issue basically seems to boil down to isapanptools from debian  looking in different directories for config files, any ideas?
[06:41] <morgue> mole_, u there?
[06:41] <RegalEagle> I can ping my own IP but not others
[06:41] <matthew_w> No ideas?  Is there a place where there would be a like... output or log
[06:41] <grant> gyaresu, so where would i get this nvidia-kernel-common?
[06:42] <osa-> akuma - i installed it that way but as always, back up your data before you put in a new OS ...
[06:42] <mole_> morgue: still downloading
[06:42] <gyaresu> RegalEagle, Do you have an appropriate 'route' set as default?
[06:42] <morgue> kk
[06:42] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: can't ping external IPs like 4.2.2.2 ?
[06:42] <gevaudan82> Akuma_: that's actually the prefered method...install ubuntu on a partition after installing whatever other os you are using...grub takes care of the rest
[06:42] <matthew_w> iratsu; try using synaptic to install the bluetooth daemon for kde
[06:42] <matthew_w> iratsu; kbluetoothd or something
[06:42] <matthew_w> iratsu; works like a charm
[06:42] <morgue> mole_, you getting the right one? it's only 40 MB
[06:42] <huck> hp_: maybe there's someone here better with hardware, sounds like it might not be setup right... I've used that guide for more than one computer and it's helped every time.
[06:42] <mole_> huck: thanks for confirming the bug
[06:42] <gevaudan82> RegalEagle: is this wireless or wired ethernet?
[06:42] <iratsu> matthew_w: hmm what if i don't use kde?
[06:43] <gyaresu> dbruno, isapanptools? is that like ISA tools?
[06:43] <RegalEagle> wired
[06:43] <Akuma_> gevaudan82: thanks
[06:43] <grant> gyaresu, so where would i get this nvidia-kernel-common?
[06:43] <robbie_> ok guys, i need help. anyone good with monitor, refresh rates and resolutions please PM me.
[06:43] <gyaresu> grant, apt-get install nvidia-kernel-common
[06:43] <grant> thanks
[06:43] <matthew_w> iratsu; it's ok - it will have to install kdelibs, but you don't need kde, you can run kde libs on top of gnome
[06:43] <RegalEagle> gyaresu: any ideas?
[06:43] <matthew_w> iratsu; I use kbluetoothd.
[06:43] <matthew_w> iratsu: but I use Gnome.
[06:44] <gyaresu> RegalEagle, did you get output from the 'route' command?
[06:44] <RegalEagle> gyaresu: I never used the route command
[06:44] <RegalEagle> gyaresu: Do I need to?
[06:44] <gyaresu> RegalEagle, My last post mentions it, yes.
[06:44] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: "route -n" as root
[06:44] <grant> gyaresu, it says nvidia-kernel-common is already the newest version
[06:45] <RegalEagle> How do I login as root?
[06:45] <gyaresu> RegalEagle, it will tell you where packets are meant to be going.
[06:45] <dbruno> gyaresu, I'm assuming, it's difficult, not my bug and I cannot replicate here, but he needed an isa package to get sound working under fedora 9, but the modem didn't work; ubuntu recognizes the modem but sound doesn't work; I suggested the package but it doesn't seem to be outputting properly, almost like the dual dhcpd config problem some have reported
[06:45] <robbie_> ok guys, i need help. anyone good with monitor, refresh rates and resolutions please PM me.
[06:45] <mole_> morgue, yes, but the idsoftware ftp site is limited to 14.4kbps
[06:45] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: su
[06:45] <gevaudan82> RegalEagle: if you really want root sudo passwd root
[06:45] <RegalEagle> k
[06:45] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: OOPS
[06:45] <Daverocks> lol forgot this is ubuntu
[06:45] <str0ng> hello.. where can i open the log file for openssh in edgy eft ?
[06:45] <RegalEagle> So what commands do I need to use, exactly?
[06:45] <morgue> mole_, try fileplanet
[06:45] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: do "sudo route -n" and type YOUR password
[06:45] <RegalEagle> k
[06:46] <grant> gyaresu, it says nvidia-kernel-common is already the newest version
[06:46] <RegalEagle> use the -n?
[06:46] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: yes
[06:46] <gevaudan82> str0ng: check in /var/log somewhere...syslog and messages can also be helpful in that same directory
[06:46] <RegalEagle> k
[06:46] <robbie_> ok guys, i need help. anyone good with monitor, refresh rates and resolutions please PM me.
[06:46] <gyaresu> dbruno, isa package is relevant to an ISA card? sounds like freaky old hardware...
[06:46] <mole_> morgue, have to wait forever in the queue to download from there don't you?
[06:46] <RegalEagle> bbiam
[06:46] <morgue> mole_, neh, 1 minute tops
[06:46] <str0ng> gevaudan82, ah ok.. thanks.. :)
=== avagant is now known as ava|movie
[06:46] <mole_> morgue, got it now
[06:46] <robbie_> Anyone good with monitor, refresh rates and resolution problems, please PM me.
[06:46] <gyaresu> grant, try going to /var/cache/apt/archives and ls -l nvidia-kernel-common*
[06:47] <dbruno> gyaresu, it is, it's a freaky old coast guard guy that get's old hardware and installs gnu/linux on it but apparently doesn't know how to ask for help online ;-)
[06:47] <gyaresu> robbie_, depends on your monitor... LCD/CRT size/brand/ect...
[06:47] <robbie_> CRT, 19" Mag
[06:47] <osa-> robbie what resolution
[06:48] <grant> gyaresu, -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5176 2006-10-09 18:03 nvidia-kernel-common_20051028+1ubuntu7_all.deb
[06:48] <gyaresu> dbruno, don't try to help him with ISA devices. just not worth it.
[06:48] <matthew_w> Blender totally crashes, and I've completely removed it and reinstalled it again and again.  This just started happening post edgy - ideas?
[06:48] <robbie_> I'm wanting 1152x864 at 60hz, but it won't let me use 60hz, and it keeps flickering. I need to know of a sure fire way to FORCE it to use 60. Editing the xorg.conf alone isn't seeming to do it.
[06:48] <gyaresu> grant, what was the kernel error again with the version numbers. (please)
[06:49] <gyaresu> dbruno, pci sound card is like $5
[06:49] <osa-> robbie what does it try to set the refresh to at that resolution?
[06:49] <robbie_> 85
[06:49] <osa-> so why not run it at 85?
[06:49] <grant> Api mismatch: the nvidia kernel module has the version 1.0-7184 but this module has version 1.0-9625
[06:49] <Tompu> grant: still having driver install issues?
[06:49] <grant> thanks
[06:49] <robbie_> it allows 75 also, but that doesn't help
[06:49] <grant> yeah tompu
[06:49] <robbie_> because 85 is causing my display to flicker or shake
[06:49] <grant> still plugging away at it
[06:49] <Brennan> does anyone know if ubuntu can be run on an external hard drive
[06:49] <robbie_> and it's highly annoying
[06:49] <grant> gyaresu, Api mismatch: the nvidia kernel module has the version 1.0-7184 but this module has version 1.0-9625
[06:50] <defrysk> grant are you trying to install nvidia-glx from amarant ?
[06:50] <grant> gyaresu, thats
[06:50] <RegalEagle> Ok
[06:50] <grant> defrysk, yeah
[06:50] <RegalEagle> I did the "route" command
[06:50] <osa-> robbie: do you have a fan right by the monitor, or do you have a power cord going over the top (or another electric device)
[06:50] <Daverocks> Brennan: it can, but it'll be slow depending on the type of connection of the external HD
[06:50] <RegalEagle> Here's what I got
[06:50] <blazemonger> anyone noticed that in edgy the doublesize option in xmms doesn't work
[06:50] <Brennan> USB 1.1
[06:50] <defrysk> grant, got the repo set up ?
[06:50] <RegalEagle> Destination:169.154.0.0
[06:50] <RegalEagle> Gateway: 0.0.0.0
[06:50] <gevaudan82> Brennan: if it's usb you might have issues but there is probally a work around...this is due to the order which things are booted...there's always the option of vmware
[06:50] <robbie_> No. I thought about that too. See, windows, at the same resolution, does the same thing at 85hz, but at 60, it's perfectly fine.
[06:50] <grant> defrysk, the whatnow with the whonow?
[06:50] <gyaresu> grant, 1.0-7 is older than the 1.0-8 that i had with edgy before installing the beta driver.
[06:50] <maddog39> hallo
[06:50] <RegalEagle> Genmask: 255.255.0.0
[06:50] <dbruno> gyaresu, heh, ok; just sucks because fedora picked up the sound but not the modem and now he's having the reverse; he's influential with the US coast guard, was trying to pull something off ;-)
[06:50] <RegalEagle> Flags: U
[06:50] <robbie_> That's how I know it's the refresh rate causing my problem.

[06:52] <RegalEagle> What does it mean?

[06:52] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: but in either case you haven't got any gateway to route through
=== vivabenfic1 is now known as vivabenfica
[06:52] <defrysk> grant, : sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx

[06:52] <RegalEagle> It showed no gateway

[06:53] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: exactly :P
[06:53] <gyaresu> grant, defrysk you can run 'apt-cache showpkg nvidia-glx' to see what version it's going to install
[06:53] <RegalEagle> Daverocks: So what do I do now?
[06:53] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: there should be a line which is like "Destination: 0.0.0.0", "Gateway: 192.168.0.1" or something
[06:53] <defrysk> gyaresu, amarant hasnt got the latests update in yet
[06:53] <matthew_w> Hey - today nvidia was updated, and since, hundreds of things are not working and are yielding an API MISMATCH error, ... what do I do about this?
[06:53] <grant> ok aptitude is done
[06:53] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: you know the IP of the gateway?
[06:53] <RegalEagle> No
[06:53] <vivabenfica> gyaresu - wifi works wihout wpa
[06:53] <defrysk> thats why it needs to downgrade

[06:55] <gyaresu> vivabenfica, you can alway put it back on if you want. wpa_supplicant isn't too hard to set up. trust me.
[06:55] <defrysk> it does not as you if you want to downgrade anything grant ?
[06:55] <vivabenfica> ok gyaresu
[06:56] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: i don't know unless i know the IP

[06:56] <gevaudan82> robbie_: if you don't get a response you probally better post to ubuntuforums.org...chances are no one is going to PM you
[06:56] <probose> someone can tell me what it means? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30243/
[06:56] <RegalEagle> Daverocks: What does the IP tend to be?
[06:56] <matthew_w> 8774 vs. 8776 is yielding all kinds of errors!
[06:56] <vivabenfica> keep in mind that what i need to do is have ubuntu properly send the password to the router
[06:56] <defrysk> grant, strange
[06:56] <gyaresu> grant,  can you do 'sudo apt-cache show-pkg nvidia-glx'
[06:57] <vivabenfica> wpa is set up via web interface to router, so i don't need to set it up.
[06:57] <duane> for some reason adept updater uninstalled my nvidia drivers and I couldnt startx
[06:57] <duane> when i try to reinstall nvidia-glx i get:
[06:57] <duane> The following packages have unmet dependencies:

[07:01] <neosa-chris> Does anyone actually ever use any CAD/CAM software in Ubuntu... such as Mastercam..
[07:01] <gyaresu> grant, so did you try installing nvidia-kernel-source?
[07:01] <RegalEagle> Daverocks: Anything?
[07:01] <neosa-chris> I'm terrible with using WINE... so i could use some assistance with that..
[07:01] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: try "route add -net 209.102.247.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0"
[07:01] <osa-> regal: edgy??
[07:01] <RegalEagle> Yes
[07:02] <RegalEagle> Daverocks: The IP address will change once I hook it up to the other computer
[07:02] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: so the default gateway is always changing?
[07:02] <RegalEagle> Daverocks: Just substitute the appropriate IP?
[07:02] <Daverocks> RegalEagle: yeah
[07:02] <RegalEagle> Daverocks: It changes with the IP
[07:02] <gyaresu> grant, ah. may be linux-restricted-modules
[07:02] <RegalEagle> Daverocks: Ok I'll test

[07:04] <mole_> morgue, look at the ioquake3 at http://icculus.org/quake3
[07:04] <duane> did they remove the beta nvidia drivers from the repos or something?

[07:05] <mole_> morgue, I'm downloading it now - it's much more modern, and open-source!
[07:06] <gyaresu> duane, beryl is amusing but buggy and not really worth the bother at the moment IMHO

[07:20] <RegalEagle> Ubuntu is on a different computer
[07:20] <r2d2_there> gyaresu i looked at man curl still not found any option to split the download, do u know it offhand
[07:20] <RegalEagle> which has a 3Com Cyclone LAN card
[07:20] <osa-> because i asked what kind of card you were using . you said a rhine
[07:20] <RegalEagle> My mistake
[07:20] <osa-> ok
[07:20] <osa-> i get it now ..
[07:20] <osa-> so you're using a second computer, disconnecting the Windows XP ..
[07:21] <osa-> and hooking it to the cable modem
[07:21] <osa-> right?
[07:21] <osa-> is there a firewall device?
[07:21] <str0ng> hello, how will i monitor my box.. for someone trying to bruteforce my ssh2 port?
[07:21] <RegalEagle> No
[07:21] <osa-> no firewall?
[07:21] <gyaresu> r2d2_there, I'll check...
[07:21] <RegalEagle> Nope
[07:21] <Cyber_Stalker> str0ng kill the port :P
[07:21] <RegalEagle> osa: as far as what you described, that's what Im doing
[07:21] <str0ng> :)
[07:22] <osa-> so do this: unplug the XP  computer from the cable modem, plug in the one with linux on it
[07:22] <osa-> then
[07:22] <osa-> dont turn on the linux one yet though
[07:22] <RegalEagle> osa: That's what Im doing....
[07:22] <osa-> leave it off
[07:22] <RegalEagle> osa: ok?
[07:22] <osa-> then REBOOT the cable modem .. unplug it and wait 10 seconds then plug it back it
[07:22] <osa-> in
[07:22] <osa-> then turn on the linux computer
[07:22] <dax> can I run XGL and BERYL at the same time?  like get both features or whatever
[07:22] <RegalEagle> osa: ok
[07:22] <osa-> because
[07:22] <osa-> the reason being
[07:22] <osa-> is that your cable modem is limited to ONE computer
[07:23] <osa-> and it does that by MAC address
[07:23] <osa-> and even if you turn that ONE computer off it remembers
[07:23] <RegalEagle> Ok, give me a few minutes then
[07:23] <osa-> sigh
[07:23] <mole_> morgue, Well I've tried both versions, unfortunately no joy.  I can confirm I have UT2003 linux demo running on edgy, however.  That was very simple to install.   I guess we'll just have to wait until someone clever compiles the open-source version for edgy.

[07:57] <Daverocks> TheWheat: and yeah, it does need to show up in ifconfig for it to work, but you can do that by bringing up the interface
[07:58] <Madpilot> Discipulus, it should; if it doesn't, at least Radio Shack is generally OK about returning stuff - keep the receipt

[08:26] <nofxx> gyaresu, yup.. terminal open
[08:26] <gyaresu> pc22, I only ever play tribes2 :)
[08:26] <nofxx> xD
[08:27] <pc22> is that for linux?
[08:27] <gyaresu> nofxx, run 'wpa_passphrase'
[08:27] <JayFM> nofxx: what differs from your position to myne? :P
[08:27] <gyaresu> pc22, yeah. only a few of us play anymore.
[08:27] <gyaresu> pc22, I'm in Australia.
[08:27] <nofxx> gyaresu, ssid stuff.. let me fill the form... 3 seconds.. xD
[08:28] <JayFM> gyaresu: Should i run wpa_supplicant, and see if i can add the correct information in then? Because right now, i can only connect to WEP encrypted networks, which isn't adiquate.
[08:28] <nofxx> wpa_passphrase  mycoolwifi myunbrekablepass
[08:28] <nofxx> correct syntax?
[08:28] <gyaresu> nofxx, so if you run 'wpa_passphrase bob thing' that will output the info you need.
[08:28] <gyaresu> nofxx, excellent.
[08:28] <gyaresu> nofxx, now...
[08:28] <pc22> gyaresu, ur nick sounds korean
[08:29] <nofxx> gyaresu, thats cool... i got that info on brackets
[08:29] <DanaG> I wonder why nobody notices the mismatch between metacity and gtk themes in Human...
[08:29] <JayFM> Brb. I have to try something :)
[08:30] <rawrness> Cause we're blind :P
[08:30] <gyaresu> nofxx, redirect that to /etc/wpa.mycoolwifi (or whatever) as root, by: 'sudo wpa_passphrase mycoolwifi myunbrek > /etc/wpa.mycoolwifi'
[08:30] <DanaG> oh, #ubuntu-artwork
[08:30] <gyaresu> pc22, japanese
[08:30] <rawrness> So we were attacked by bots?
[08:30] <mm2000> hello, how can i find out what files are growing in size?
[08:31] <mm2000> Think i have some sort of leak...
[08:31] <gyaresu> nofxx, now what wireless chip do you have?
[08:32] <gyaresu> nofxx, if you run wpa_supplicant you'll see the example at the bottom. check it out.
[08:32] <nofxx> gyaresu, its a msi cb 54g... humm... i'll have to check out the site to see the chipset... wait a sec
[08:32] <nofxx> gyaresu, even with sudo I got a permission denied on > /etc/wpa.wifinet
[08:33] <DanaG> you have to sudo -i
[08:33] <DanaG> the pipe isn't sudo'd
[08:33] <nofxx> still denied
[08:33] <gyaresu> nofxx, DanaG yes. thanks. (I usually just login as root when doing these things)

[08:34] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:35] <nofxx> gyaresu, yup I know... but its not working... xD
[08:35] <nofxx> gyaresu, the chipset is Ralink RT2500
[08:35] <gyaresu> nofxx, sudo was for me :)
[08:35] <compwiz18> hi all
[08:35] <charlie5> gyaresu: can I copy the /boot/grub dir from my original OS to the /boot dir of the rescue OS ... and then do the grub-install ?
[08:36] <gyaresu> charlie5, argh! you might need to chroot. Been so long I can't rember exactly...
[08:36] <nofxx> gyaresu, hehee sorry man... i have an k6 as torrent downloader with slack... didn't figure out this sudo thing when i came to ubuntu... even asked here "how to log as root ?"?"
[08:36] <compwiz18> can someone tell me how i can tell if /var/lib/dpkg/lock  is locked because something (ie synaptic, apt-get) is open?
[08:36] <axisys> !font
[08:36] <ubotu> Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto
[08:36] <gyaresu> nofxx, sudo passwd
[08:37] <gyaresu> nofxx, then you can 'su -' to get a login shell...
[08:37] <charlie5> gyaresu: :D ... ok, i'll cross my fingers and give it a shot ;-) ... thanks
[08:37] <gyaresu> charlie5, let me know if it works.
[08:38] <charlie5> gyaresu: ok
[08:38] <R0bbie> Anyone in here good with resolution and refresh rate problems?
[08:38] <nofxx> gyaresu, now it worked .. xD
[08:38] <nofxx> wpa.wifi is on /etc
[08:39] <HymnToLife> !anyone | R0bbie
[08:39] <ubotu> R0bbie: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:39] <gyaresu> nofxx, cool. where were we. ah yes. interface driver for wpa_sup
[08:39] <compwiz18> can someone tell me how i can tell if /var/lib/dpkg/lock  is locked because something (ie synaptic, apt-get) is open?
[08:39] <nofxx> gyaresu , yup.. i see the example...
[08:40] <gyaresu> nofxx, so you can now 'cat /etc/wpa.wifithingy'
[08:40] <gyaresu> nofxx, so the "-c" option makes sense?
[08:40] <R0bbie> Ok, I've edited the xorg.conf file to use a certain verticle refresh rate and a single screen resolution. However, it will not use the resolution. It automaticly puts it on something else. I've tried adding a HorizSync with the specs my monitor says to use, but it claims the monitor can't do it. I know that's BS because Windows uses that same resolution with the same refresh rate. So I'm wonder, what the hell?
[08:40] <nofxx> gyaresu , yup.. .so its it ? hehe..

[08:41] <charlie5> errr ... will     grub-install --no-floppy /dev/fd0    make a grub floppy so i can test it 1st ?
[08:41] <scamboy> !xorgconf
[08:41] <nofxx> gyaresu.. hum.. but how about the ubuntu network manager ? just dont open it ?
[08:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xorgconf - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:41] <charlie5> ack ... without the --no-floppy i ghuess :)
[08:42] <nofxx> gyaresu.. i mean.. this line will start and bring the inface on

[08:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xorg.conf - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:42] <gyaresu> nofxx, so now you can manually run 'wpa_supplicant -D -iwlan0 wext -c /etc/wpa.wifithingy'

[08:42] <CaptainMorgan> what's the command for g++ version at the comman line?
[08:43] <gyaresu> nofxx, yes it will (and you can -B to back ground it later) but just see if it works from another console for now...
[08:43] <scamboy> !xorg
[08:43] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto

[08:46] <preaction> v3r510nj, hi
[08:47] <gyaresu> nofxx, probably the wrong driver (-D)
[08:47] <scamboy> v3, no
[08:47] <gyaresu> nofxx, you'll need to find out which driver it wants to use...
[08:47] <nofxx> gyaresu , -Dwext.. it runned.. but... hm.. "No such device"
[08:47] <nofxx> gyaresu.. aa.. I see....
[08:47] <compwiz18> @corpsefeeder: can you change the printer settings?
[08:47] <compwiz18> instead of the document settings?
[08:47] <gyaresu> nofxx, maybe even the wrong interface name (what do you get from iwconfig)
[08:48] <CorpseFeeder> compwiz18: evince does not give me access to any printer settings

[08:51] <compwiz18> atarinox: try wifi-radar
[08:51] <squidly> atarinox: look up linux wardriving
[08:51] <sess> can anyone offer an explanation for why downloading binaries from my usenet server in ubuntu is about half the speed as it is in windows?  Is there something I need to tweak?
[08:51] <compwiz18> atarinox: its in multiverse
[08:51] <gyaresu> atarinox, k. do you know about 'man' pages?
[08:51] <compwiz18> atarinox: or univrse, dont know which
[08:51] <RamiKassab> hey guys if I have gaim 2.0 beta 3 installed and want to install beta 4 from source, can I just install it without removing beta 3?
[08:51] <scamboy> sess: bandwith limited
[08:51] <atarinox> yeah i know the universe repository
[08:51] <scamboy> ramil: cannot
[08:51] <compwiz18> atarinox: look for wifi-radar
[08:51] <RamiKassab> I just logged in as root, ran ./configure, then make, then make install
[08:52] <nofxx> gyaresu, stoped on WEXT auth param 5 value 0x1 -
[08:52] <gyaresu> compwiz18, how about he just starts with the basics...
[08:52] <sess> scamboy: what do you mean by that exactly.  that Ubuntu limits my incoming bandwith?
[08:52] <atarinox> yeah it's installed..buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut how
[08:52] <compwiz18> gyaresu: yeah, it probably wouldn't hurt for him to know what iwlist *** scan does...
[08:52] <poningru> ok dude dont do that
[08:52] <scamboy> sess: no..people are updating edgy....
[08:52] <gyaresu> compengi, do want to interpret the output for him or shall i.
[08:53] <compwiz18> CorpseFeeder: I don't know...
[08:53] <gyaresu> compengi, you can help him if you want...
[08:53] <sess> scamboy: I completely don't get what you're saying.  what does that have to do with my access to giganews
[08:53] <RamiKassab> scamboy: I can't do that?
[08:53] <gyaresu> nofxx, so it crashed huh?
[08:53] <compwiz18> CorpseFeeder: apart from downloading the linux version of adobe reader
[08:53] <charlie5> gyaresu: i had to add a root-diectory switch and it *seems* to have worked ... about to re-boot & try it
[08:53] <charlie5> sudo grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=/media /dev/sda1
[08:53] <nofxx> gyaresu , yup...
[08:53] <scamboy> oppss....sorry..
[08:53] <gyaresu> charlie5, nice. see you on the flip-side :)
[08:54] <charlie5> gyaresu: hope so ;)
[08:54] <scamboy> ramil: usually cannot...but you can try ask others..
[08:54] <nofxx> gyaresu, the icon shows disconnected with my old open system configuration... on the network manager gui
[08:54] <gyaresu> nofxx, can you paste the line you're using and maybe the output of 'lspci' please (via pastebin)
[08:55] <gyaresu> nofxx, iwconfig is your friend.
[08:55] <RamiKassab> scamboy: then how do I uninstall beta 3
[08:55] <RamiKassab> ?
[08:55] <scamboy> sess: are you trying to update ubuntu??
[08:55] <nofxx> gyaresu... that'll be tricky... hmm...let me try to find some eth cables to plug the note
[08:55] <compwiz18> does anyone know how to unlock the packages lock file via the terminal?
[08:55] <gyaresu> nofxx, iwconfig in another terminal from the one you run wpa_sup in is essential at the moment.
[08:55] <scamboy> ramil: juz update..but i heard beta 4 is having problem..
[08:56] <atarinox> oh god
[08:56] <nofxx> gyaresu, ok.. set up
[08:56] <atarinox> sorry
[08:56] <atarinox> my keyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[08:56] <atarinox> oh god
[08:56] <atarinox> my keyboard is oging nuts
[08:56] <sess> scamboy: no, Im downloading an instructional video on modifying the psp's hardware.  Its just that in windows I get a transfer rate of about 450K/s from giganews, but in ubuntu using the program nzb Im only getting 212K/s, almost exactly half
[08:56] <atarinox> hopefully it's done
[08:56] <atarinox> *types lightly*
[08:56] <atarinox> how do i search for available networks in wifi radaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar

[08:56] <atarinox> rrr
[08:56] <atarinox> goddamn
[08:56] <compwiz18> atarinox: figure out how to use iwlist *** scan first
[08:56] <squidly> atarinox: wtf?
[08:57] <compwiz18> i think his keyboard is broken
[08:57] <gyaresu> nofxx, right.
[08:57] <scamboy> sess: maybe its a driver issue...not sure...get some 2 help you...
[08:57] <squidly> that may be
[08:57] <gyaresu> nofxx, so could you link or paste your wpa_supplicant -ira0 -c /etc/  blahblah  line please?
[08:58] <squidly> arg.. I think I lost all my other consoles ><
[08:58] <seamus7> Anyone here knowledgeable about the Gnome Panel .. I upgraded to Edgy and now a few of the panel applets no longer display background transparency. correctly.

[08:58] <sess> Is there a speed limit to NDISWRAPPER powered wifi cards?  Or can I get the full bandwith
[08:59] <gyaresu> nofxx, and it crashes yes? so have you tried the other '-D' drivers?
[08:59] <compwiz18> sess: im pretty sure ndisrwrapper supports 54mbps
[08:59] <compwiz18> sess: which is full speed
[08:59] <nomad111> can any1 tell me how to set the power scheme on my laptop
[08:59] <nofxx> gyaresu , aa.. got this.. let me try another one
[08:59] <gyaresu> nofxx, the file '/etc/wpa.nofxx' is the output of the 'wpa_passphrase' command right?
[08:59] <compwiz18> nomad111: what do you want it set to?
[08:59] <nofxx> Ralink RT2500 is the chipset
[09:00] <compwiz18> nofxx: are you using ndiswrapper?
[09:00] <nomad111> compwiz18,  available cpufreq governors: userspace, powersave, ondemand, conservative, performance
[09:00] <nomad111> i want ondemand
[09:00] <sess> compwiz18: Im just not seeing my full bandwith atm.  My usual connection between giganews is around 450K/s, but my BCM4318 in linux seems only capable of 212K/s, and its stalling out any other connection I have, (eg can't check websites apparently)
[09:00] <nofxx> compwiz18 : i never met him.. xD
[09:00] <compwiz18> nomad111: download cpufreqd
[09:00] <sess> compwiz18: forget the stalling webpages, I think the edgy upgrade site is just too busy
[09:00] <gyaresu> !rt2500
[09:00] <compwiz18> nomad111: and then edit config
[09:00] <ubotu> rt2500: configuration tool for wireless RT2500 network cards. In component universe, is extra. Version 1.1.0+cvs20060620-3 (edgy), package size 106 kB, installed size 404 kB
[09:00] <sess> compwiz18: but the rest of what I said still applies
[09:01] <nomad111> how
[09:01] <squidly> arg brb
[09:01] <nomad111> i just installed it
[09:01] <charlie5> gyaresu: nope ... i muffed it ... will try again ... does 'active' state of a partition matter ?
[09:01] <compwiz18> sess: i've got the same card as you
[09:01] <nofxx> hm... will look for it
[09:01] <compwiz18> sess: are you using ndiswrapper?

[09:02] <morgue> i downloaded the unreal tournament 2004 demo, now i have the UT...gz file, how do i run it?
[09:02] <sess> scamboy: Im just stabbing at straws here, I really don't think its the driver, cause now that I think about it, lan copying runs at around 2M/s
[09:02] <compwiz18> sess: mine goes higher then that: try iwconfig [INTERFACE-NAME-HERE]  rate 54M
[09:03] <gyaresu> moreon, tar.gz is a compressed file
[09:03] <compwiz18> nomad111:hold on a sec, let me find it
[09:03] <nomad111> compwiz18, much appreciated
[09:03] <gyaresu> morgue, tar.gz is a compressed file. you need to (probably) 'tar zxvf thing.tar.gz'
[09:03] <sess> compwiz18: I did it, but the rate is still 11Mb.  I think its because the router is only a B router
[09:04] <compwiz18> sess: that would be the problem.  I know mine will go higher then that...

[09:04] <compwiz18> nomad111: the config file is at /etc/cpufreqd.conf
[09:04] <compwiz18> nomad111:if you need help editing it, ask
[09:04] <scamboy> jay: you are not rude..
[09:04] <sess> compwiz18: however, 11 megabits should far exceed 200K/s, and it doesn't really explain why my transfer speeds from teh same news server are double in windows...
[09:04] <gyaresu> morgue, use 'gunzip -d UT*'
[09:05] <morgue> gunzip: UT2004-LNX-Demo3334.run.gz: not in gzip format
[09:05] <JayFM> Lol, okay then scamboy :)
[09:05] <compwiz18> JayFM: what is your wireless interface name?
[09:05] <gyaresu> morgue, well... it is.
[09:05] <JayFM> Wireless interface name? Do you mean like 'ath0' or something?
[09:05] <gyaresu> morgue, so...
[09:05] <compwiz18> JayFM: yep
[09:06] <nofxx> JayFM , iwconfig
[09:06] <scamboy> eth0
[09:06] <morgue> gyaresu, that's what i get when i run $ gunzip -d UT2004-LNX-Demo3334.run.gz
[09:06] <compwiz18> JayFM: run iwconfig, and give us the name of the interface that has the most information
[09:07] <JayFM> So what exactly do i need to do? (I need to reboot into linux, so this may take some time).
[09:07] <nomad111> compwiz18, it seems to work without me needing to do anything
[09:07] <gyaresu> morgue, Did you download via 'apt' or direct from a website.
[09:07] <compwiz18> nomad111: cool
[09:07] <morgue> gyaresu, direct from website
[09:07] <nomad111> compwiz18, i think it started to set the cpu speed when i installed, like when the daemon was started, does that sound right
[09:07] <compwiz18> nomad111: if you want it to use ondemand while plugged in though, it gets trickier (i think)
[09:07] <squidly> hmm..
[09:07] <gyaresu> morgue, it definitely is a gzip file (man gzip) so maybe it's corrupted.
[09:08] <zoople> hi ppl. for the life of me i cant get my IPOD working. ive got Amarok, but it says theres no support for MP3
[09:08] <compwiz18> nomad111: that sounds right

[09:24] <chalcedony> compengi: i need sudo for that? is there another way because i don't have root on this box/
[09:24] <nomad111> compwiz18, if i do cpufreq-info i get this:   no or unknown cpufreq driver is active on this CPU

[09:26] <chalcedony> even pkill isn't getting rid of this huge scan window.

[09:27] <gyaresu_coffee> morgue, you just 'chmod +x blah.run' and then './blah.run' and answer the questions.
[09:27] <morgue> gyaresu_coffee, how do i run the .run ?
[09:27] <compwiz18> nomad111: then restart the utility again

[09:27] <nomad111> compwiz18, sudo /etc/init.d/cpufreqd restart ??

[09:27] <compwiz18> nomad111: that one
[09:28] <nomad111> compwiz18, ok restarted
[09:28] <chalcedony> gyaresu_coffee: i have too much junk in my home directory to run the gui
[09:28] <compwiz18> nomad111: run cpufreq-info again
[09:28] <nomad111> compwiz18, wat to do now?

[09:28] <compwiz18> nomad111: ok, hang on for a sec
[09:28] <gyaresu_coffee> chalcedony, so what 'huge xsane window' are you talking about?

[09:29] <JayFM> How do i access it?
[09:29] <chalcedony> gyaresu_coffee: i scanned a page. it came out huge and i tried to close it with x .. it won't close and won't die
[09:29] <whadar> which init script mounts the entries of /etc/fstab? i could not find any docs about it...
[09:30] <compwiz18> JayFM: try wpa_supplicant in the terminal
[09:30] <nofxx> JayFM : first run wpa_passphrase SSID  YOURPHRASE
[09:30] <compwiz18> nofxx: synaptic, look for wifi-radar or network-manager-gnome
[09:30] <gyaresu_coffee> chalcedony, so go to a command line and run the 'xkill' prog. then click on that page and it will die.

[10:09] <Mantice> Whats the difference between a gnome theme and a Compiz theme?
[10:09] <Crankymonky> Alkali, you could always run it under Wine if you can't get an alternative-which there may or may not be
[10:09] <halex-ab> Mantice, one will work if you have Compiz, the other one won't.. ;)
[10:10] <alkali> Crankymonky: You are a man of genius.  And bud light will do a commercial about you.  I'm gonna try to wine it right now.
[10:10] <xarq> how do I generate the ID for a hard drive I want to add to the fstab in edgy?
[10:10] <Mantice> I thought Compiz was just a graphics engine thing that made your windows have special effects.
[10:10] <halex-ab> Mantice, yes, but if you try and have a GNOME theme running while you have Compiz going, you won't see your GNOME theme..

[10:11] <Crankymonky> alkali, another option is "Streamtuner", but probably just radio
[10:11] <trogdoor> Mantice: Compiz themes can have things like translucency, gnome themes can't
[10:11] <savvas> Dowey: on which ubuntu did it work? ubuntu dapper or ubuntu edgy?
[10:12] <C_REATiVE_> what causes that ?
[10:12] <Dowey> actually breezy
[10:12] <savvas> Dowey: and now you still use breezy?
[10:12] <Mantice> So if you run Compiz you cant use gnome themes you have to use Compiz themes.
[10:12] <Dowey> savvas, ya nothing should have changed
[10:13] <trogdoor> Mantice: As far as I know, yes
[10:13] <Mantice> are Beryl and Compiz the same ?
[10:13] <Mantice> I mean do the same thing.
[10:13] <halex-ab> Mantice, yes..
[10:13] <halex-ab> Beryl is a fork of Compiz
[10:14] <trogdoor> Mantice: No, Beryl is a fork of compiz that is more up to date but less stable.

[10:29] <alkali> sess: but think of how much weight that is to lose.  And he could train to walk on his hands
[10:29] <ndowens> i don't like asking to use their internet, there isn't any other way, or any boot options that would help me?
[10:29] <sess> alkali: lol :)
[10:29] <Madpilot> ndowens, not on the LiveCD, no.
[10:29] <Crankymonky> Isn't dvdtools included in both dapper and edgy?  and probably breezy?  <--breezy a guess
[10:29] <quakenul> i upgraded to edgy eft recently and after rebooting my server it says "target filesystem doesn't have /sbin/init" and refuses to mount the fs
[10:30] <quakenul> insted im being put in something called BusyBox which I guess is a fallback shell...?
[10:30] <Dowey> savvas, i got the list
[10:30] <savvas> Crankymonky: probably, but how would i know what's updated and what's not?
[10:30] <alkali> quakenul: it refuses to mount the filesytem or take you to a shell?
[10:30] <quakenul> anyhow i'm not able to fix this on my own :/ any help is appreciated
[10:30] <[gen2] niki> how can i replace a synaptics deb with a homebrew build of a package without deinstalling any software that has this software as dep
[10:30] <[gen2] niki> i want to replace freetype with a source compile
[10:30] <sess> alkali: still a running with more and stronger muscles could most likely outrun a much lighter runner, depending on quite a few factors
[10:31] <quakenul> alkali: as far as i can tell both is true
[10:31] <savvas> Dowey: ok, do: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[10:31] <ndowens> ugh, here i was looking forward to getting the cd
[10:31] <sess> alkali: actually, I guess thats not really a statement that would hold true, just based on teh diversity of physical human attributes and their contribution to speed/agility
[10:31] <alkali> quakenul: I have to say you wouldn't boot into a shell at all if the root hd isn't mounted.  What are your startup errors, or are you on edgy?
[10:32] <alkali> sess: But such a valid argument for either case :-D
[10:32] <compwiz18> one more question before i leave: does anyone else feel like the wifi managers available are all bad or have problems?
[10:32] <quakenul> uhm alkali
[10:32] <alkali> We're not aerodynamic we just push things in front of us out of the way
[10:32] <quakenul> let me figure =)
[10:32] <axisys> !mplayer
[10:32] <ubotu> mplayer is a media player. Enable multiverse repo and type sudo apt-get install mplayer for more info please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer  To compile it from source see:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer/Compile
[10:32] <savvas> alkali: we are aerodynamic :p
[10:32] <ubotu> For Codecs try !codecs Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MplayerInstallHowto for installation tips.
[10:33] <alkali> Anyone know how to get a verbose startup in edgy?  Do you press esc?
[10:33] <alkali> savvas: like a brick wall
[10:33] <compwiz18> alkali: in grub, edit the entry and remove the word splash
[10:33] <savvas> Dowey: upgrading?
[10:33] <alkali> yea but there used to be a button to be pressed in dapper and the one before
[10:34] <alkali> like ctrl+alt+f1
[10:34] <Dowey> savvas: yup
[10:34] <savvas> Dowey: cool, when it's done, do: sudo apt-get remove automatix automatix2
[10:34] <savvas> Dowey: you'll probably need a restart after all the upgrades heh
[10:34] <tarelerulz> eView 17f3 and I can't seem to get more then 640X480
[10:35] <Sarkie> Hi all, who just helped me ?? hmm
[10:35] <Dowey> savvas, im a little nervous
[10:36] <savvas> Dowey: you can always retrieve your data even from windows
[10:36] <Sarkie> I just installed all the stuff for my wireless on ubuntu, but it cant connect to my wireless network!
[10:36] <alkali> quakenul: do you know where your logfiles are?
[10:36] <ndowens> i remember one of the older ubuntu worked fine
[10:36] <trogdoor> Sarkie: What are you doing to try to connect?
[10:36] <Mantice> I checked about a year a go that Linux cant write NTFS drives is this still true ?
[10:37] <quakenul> alkali: well normally i do
[10:37] <Crankymonky> Linux can write to NTFS drive but it's not 100%
[10:37] <trogdoor> Mantice: It can, but it's not entirely stable
[10:37] <quakenul> its hard to explain i guess
[10:37] <trogdoor> !fuse
[10:37] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[10:37] <Dowey> savvas, how???
[10:37] <Crankymonky> it could create corruption
[10:37] <Sarkie> Using Network Manager, enter my 128 bit wpa passphrase or the 64/128 bit HEX version, it tries to connect then fails
[10:37] <savvas> Dowey: http://www.fs-driver.org/index.html
[10:37] <Crankymonky> ntfs 3g!
[10:37] <quakenul> its like it loads a fallback filesystem
[10:37] <quakenul> this is none of my data
[10:37] <quakenul> or config
[10:37] <quakenul> half of the path doesnt exist
[10:38] <ndowens> so how do i not load the live cd on the ram
[10:38] <quakenul> i cant even tell what version it is
[10:38] <trogdoor> Sarkie: Did you also set up wpasupplicant with the person who previously helped you?
[10:38] <alkali> quakenul: at the beginning when you're in grub choose failsafe and let it load and look for failures or errors
[10:38] <Sarkie> nope trogdoor
[10:38] <quakenul> tried that alkali
[10:38] <quakenul> same result
[10:38] <Sarkie> I guess that'd help
[10:39] <alkali> quakenul: so when you start up what exactly does it do and say in detail
[10:39] <Dowey> savvas, what about from linux
[10:39] <trogdoor> !wpa | Sarkie
[10:39] <ubotu> Sarkie: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:39] <quakenul> in the end it complains at /sbin/init missing
[10:39] <quakenul> okay
[10:39] <quakenul> lets see
[10:39] <quakenul> i will reboot
[10:39] <trogdoor> Sarkie: I have never done it before, but I believe you need wpasupplicant
[10:39] <Sarkie> oh ok
[10:39] <Sarkie> thanx
[10:39] <ndowens> alkali: so how do i not load it in to ram
[10:40] <savvas> Dowey: you can, from any live cd with mount
[10:40] <quakenul> root (hd0,0)
[10:40] <quakenul> fs type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
[10:40] <luz> hi. what number Windows has - http://www.wklej.org/id/5b9aaed12d ? (GRUB)
[10:40] <trogdoor> ndowens: What do you mean by not load it into ram?
[10:40] <Dowey> savvas, ooh, well i have no idea how to do that so lets cross our fingers
[10:40] <alkali> ndowens: No I was saying that you wanted it to load faster you load it into ram.  But you have 128 MB so loading it into ram is a similar situation to stuffing 10 pounds of something in a 5 pound bag.  You imagine what that object is in the bag.
[10:41] <savvas> Dowey: already crossed hehe
[10:41] <quakenul> kernel /boot/vmlinz-2.6.17-10-server root=UUID=d7eb78-0612-427 (...) 075 ro quiet splash
[10:41] <ndowens> ah
[10:41] <quakenul> [Linux-bzImage, setup 0x1c00, size=0x18d9cd] 
[10:41] <alkali> quakenul: you might want to pastebin it......
[10:42] <alkali> and I can read the whole thing
[10:42] <quakenul> alright :)
[10:42] <Dowey> savvas: im confused then again its 2:40 here
[10:42] <alkali> ha 4:42 am here.
[10:42] <alkali> ndowens: Does it load to get to the install?
[10:43] <Dowey> savvas, i basically cant seem to mount my drive
[10:43] <savvas> Dowey: well it's already mounted
[10:44] <savvas> your root directory / is the main partition
[10:44] <Dowey> savvas, i just dont understand why ubuntu cant read it
[10:45] <savvas> Dowey: can't read what? :\ windows?
[10:45] <alkali> alkali's tip of the day:  Never enter "sudo rm -rf /" into a terminal.  Unless you just really love ubuntu installs
[10:45] <Dowey> savvas, my dvd burner
[10:45] <Crankymonky> I haven't been reading your whole problem, but is your bios finding it?  check that first
[10:45] <savvas> Dowey: maybe because it's outdated, i'm not sure
[10:46] <savvas> Dowey: that's why you're updating now :)
[10:46] <Dowey> savvas: oh it finished
[10:46] <alkali> quakenul: Did you get the pastebin?
[10:47] <quakenul> just finished it
[10:47] <quakenul> waiting for the server to post it
[10:47] <savvas> Dowey: ok now do: sudo apt-get install dvd+rw-tools cdrdao
[10:47] <quakenul> ...which he refused to do :&
[10:48] <quakenul> http://pastebin.ca/239399
[10:48] <quakenul> there you go
[10:49] <h4rb1ng3r> hi ppl. linux noob here. i need some help getting a few things working..
[10:49] <h4rb1ng3r> if anyone would be so pbliging
[10:49] <shadowfalx> sure if you ask your questions, someone will try and help
[10:50] <Dowey> savvas, does it matter that i didnt get every update
[10:50] <georgeb> quakenul: maybe replacing UUID=... with de actual device (ie /dev/hda1) might help
[10:50] <quakenul> why, i can try
[10:50] <savvas> Dowey: do: sudo apt-get install -f
[10:50] <h4rb1ng3r> firstly i have created some smb shares on a newly installed ubuntu box and when i go to access them from a machine on the network i need a password and username
[10:50] <savvas> Dowey: that should fix things up
[10:51] <quakenul> maybe im completly wrong here but i heared about the init system being replaced in edgy
[10:51] <alkali> quakenul: people in the forums have your problem.  Thread here http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-89439.html
[10:51] <georgeb> quakenul: can you also post you /etc/fstab file ?
[10:51] <quakenul> thanks alkali !
[10:51] <quakenul> nope georgeb
[10:51] <Dowey> savvas, i get an error every time about cipherfunk
[10:52] <alkali> quakenul: They recommend fsck you're HD to make sure it isn'y corrupt.  Read though to see if there is anything else.
[10:52] <h4rb1ng3r> ive tried the username and pw i use for loggin into the ubuntu box but it doesnt work
[10:52] <shadowfalx> h4rblng3r I have a RH book, I'll look there, maybe I can find something
[10:52] <quakenul> hm k
[10:52] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: How technical are you?
[10:52] <MistaED> quakenul: yes upstart replaced sysvinit, but still uses the init scripts (they will be replaced with upstart ones in feisty)
[10:52] <h4rb1ng3r> pretty tech
[10:52] <h4rb1ng3r> just not that familiar with linux recently
[10:52] <quakenul> k
[10:52] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: You having a hard time logging in right?
[10:53] <h4rb1ng3r> yeah
[10:53] <savvas> Dowey: that's a package name? :\
[10:53] <FirstStrike> do you know your root password h4rb1ng3r?
[10:54] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: well funny thing about ubuntu, or used to be, is that the root password is not setup at the beginning, just a sudo password.  You could boot failsafe kernel and use the command adduser to add a name and password
[10:54] <h4rb1ng3r> do i need to create another user for remote access? FirstStrike: yeah
[10:54] <Dowey> savvas, i know, but it never unpackaged itself
[10:54] <n1gke> Good morning everyone.
[10:54] <h4rb1ng3r> thats what im trying to use to login with
[10:54] <savvas> Dowey: try this: sudo apt-get install --reinstall cipherfunk
[10:54] <trogdoor> alkali: You don't need to boot into safe mode, just sudo passwd root
[10:54] <FirstStrike> boot ubuntu into safe mode
=== Crankymonky is now known as CrankAFK
[10:55] <trogdoor> FirstStrike:  You don't need to boot into safe mode, just sudo passwd root
[10:55] <alkali> trogdoor: but he can't login.  He can just use the command prompt in safe
[10:55] <h4rb1ng3r> is anyone here familiar with the magazine atomic and the ubuntu install they are doing?
[10:55] <FirstStrike> you can only use sudo if you're logged in
[10:55] <Dowey> savvas, Couldn't stat source package list ftp://cipherfunk.org breezy/main Packages
[10:55] <trogdoor> alkali: Oh sorry, I should have looked back at his problem.
[10:56] <alkali> can you login as the name root h4rb1ng3r?
[10:56] <alkali> with the root password
[10:56] <CarinArr> !paste
[10:56] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[10:56] <h4rb1ng3r> i can use the actual machine to login. i just cant get to the shares ive created on the n/w yet
[10:56] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: That last thing you said I didn't follow
[10:57] <h4rb1ng3r> alkali: u mean when i try and login into the samba share?
[10:57] <FirstStrike> So, you can login locally using the username and password but you can't login remotely?
[10:57] <shadowfalx> ie, he has access to the box, cant get the shares on Network
[10:57] <h4rb1ng3r> FirstStrike: yeah exactly
[10:57] <FirstStrike> Sounds more like a permissions/group issue.
[10:58] <FirstStrike> Although, I have little knowledge of samba so I can't help out much.
[10:58] <h4rb1ng3r> when i say remotely, i mean, access the samba shares ive made.
[10:58] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: Um, well my knowledge is tapped out cause I know as much about samba as I do about black holes and women.  Similar but puzzling
[10:58] <h4rb1ng3r> alkali: LOL
[10:58] <h4rb1ng3r> ok, next prob then. ( ill have another stab at that later.
[10:58] <FirstStrike> Blackholes just deal with whatever you throw at it, but women give you kids.
[10:58] <FirstStrike> Kind of a raw deal
[10:58] <shadowfalx> H4blng3r stupid wuestion, what OS are you using to access the samba files?
[10:59] <h4rb1ng3r> shadowfalx: vista
[10:59] <h4rb1ng3r> the next issue is refresh rates of my monitor
[10:59] <shadowfalx> humm, give me a few mins, I'll research online, maybe a problem with vista
[10:59] <h4rb1ng3r> it can only set it to a max of 60hz
[11:00] <FirstStrike> I'm rather sure you can edit that in the xorg.conf
[11:00] <alkali> quakenul: any luck or similar problems to that in the post?
[11:00] <h4rb1ng3r> wth can i change something so i get all the proper res's and refreshs?
[11:01] <quakenul> not yet, i will go for http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=223773&highlight=target+filesystem+doesn%27t+have+%2Fsbin%2Finit
[11:01] <Dowey> savvas, thanks for trying but i gotta go to bed
[11:01] <quakenul> which i will need a live cd for
[11:01] <trogdoor> h4rb1ng3r: What kind of card do you have?
[11:01] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: for your specific card and monitor?
[11:01] <quakenul> which im downloading right now :)
[11:01] <FirstStrike> Did you install the drivers for your graphic card h4rb1ng3r?
[11:01] <savvas> Dowey: do a restart, see if everything is ok though, i'll have to go too, but to study :P
[11:02] <mnepton> h4rb1ng3r: sudo dpkg-rconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:02] <quakenul> but in the process i will also try fsck
[11:02] <mnepton> errr
[11:02] <mnepton> h4rb1ng3r: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:02] <alkali> quakenul: well if it works then awesome! udev should be updated though.....but good luck.
[11:03] <zsh> hey can one have both kde and gnome at the same time?
[11:03] <alkali> I completely forgot I was gonna recompile my kernel this morning
[11:03] <trogdoor> zsh: Yes.
[11:03] <zsh> much like in redhat, so that i choose the one i want during bootup
[11:03] <trogdoor> zsh: Yes.
[11:03] <zsh> trogdoor, how do i do that
[11:04] <shadowfalx> zsh: yes install Kubuntu-desktop if you have ubuntu
[11:04] <trogdoor> zsh: Are you now using ubuntu or kubuntu?
[11:04] <AlanHaggai> How to show explicitly on the desktop, the hard disc partitions I have mounted?
[11:04] <zsh> trogdoor, ubuntu
[11:04] <shadowfalx> or ubuntu-desktop if you have Kubuntu
[11:04] <trogdoor> zsh: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[11:04] <zsh> shadowfalx, trogdoor, ok cool, are there any potential problems?
[11:04] <cyphase> h4rb1ng3r: you're having a problem accessing samba shares from vista?
[11:05] <trogdoor> zsh: Only that your KDE applications will be cluttering your gnome menus and vice versa
[11:06] <defrysk> menu can be edited
[11:06] <zsh> is there a way they can be separate, withot doing a totally different installation
[11:06] <AlanHaggai> How to show explicitly on the desktop, the hard disc partitions I have mounted?
[11:06] <zsh> *without
[11:06] <shadowfalx> zsh: no, I had it set up like that before, other then trogdoor's answer the amount of space it takes uo *can* be to much for some people, though any new HD can handle it easy
[11:06] <POVaddct> AlanHaggai: open a terminal and type in: df
[11:06] <trogdoor> zsh: Yes
[11:07] <AlanHaggai> POVaddct : ok done
[11:07] <n1gke> zsh, Without going into details, I think you can use VMWARE for that.
[11:07] <h4rb1ng3r> alkali: i have a radeon 9200se. FirstStrike: no i havent installed the drivers. but i WAS able to get some more refresh rates in a previous install of ubuntu. Oh and my monitor is a sony/dell 17crt flatscreen (imtrying to remember the model#
[11:07] <savvas> !opera
[11:07] <ubotu> opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[11:07] <trogdoor> n1gke: I don't think he meanse that drastically
[11:07] <shadowfalx> sorry zsh, was way late on my last one
[11:07] <n1gke> trogdoor, ok.
[11:08] <zsh> n1gke, no, i was thinking of a more permanent solution
[11:08] <trogdoor> !ati | h4rb1ng3r
[11:08] <ubotu> h4rb1ng3r: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:08] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: proper refresh rates come with successful driver installs and googling monitor specs for horizontal and vertical refresh rates
[11:08] <AlanHaggai> POVaddct : what should I do now?
[11:08] <zsh> trogdoor, yes?!?
[11:08] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: and with ati you're already at a disadvantage
[11:08] <trogdoor> zsh: You just want the applications not cluttering menus right?
[11:08] <POVaddct> AlanHaggai: the df output shows you the mounted filesystems
[11:08] <zsh> trogdoor, yep!
[11:08] <h4rb1ng3r> alkali: ok, whats weird is half worked on a previous install
[11:08] <[gen2] niki> can someone help me?
[11:09] <trogdoor> zsh: There is a tutorial, looking for the link now...
[11:09] <[gen2] niki> i want to replace libfreetype6 with a source compile
[11:09] <AlanHaggai> POVaddct : Yes. They are all mounted. But, only the root partition shows up in the desktop
[11:09] <[gen2] niki> but the source would make a deb called freetype
[11:09] <h4rb1ng3r> yeah i know ati suck in linux. i remember from my last time messing with it
[11:09] <[gen2] niki> and both are in conflict then
[11:09] <alkali> h4rb1ng3r: Not weird it's just you set it up for that kernel and not the new one you upgraded to.  You'll have to do all the work again
[11:09] <POVaddct> AlanHaggai: don't ask me desktop things. i am a commandline user.
[11:10] <AlanHaggai> ok POVaddct :)
[11:10] <savvas> !sources
[11:10] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[11:10] <shadowfalx> h4rblng3r: sorry I cant find anything, except, that older versions of samba don't work well/if at all in vista, make sure you have new samba
[11:10] <n1gke> [gen2] niki, would it help if you renamed the first xxxxxxx.old then added the source compile ?
[11:11] <[gen2] niki> dunno
[11:11] <[gen2] niki> the problem is if i deinstall freetype at first
[11:11] <[gen2] niki> it wants to delete half of all installed packages
[11:11] <[gen2] niki> x-x
[11:12] <n1gke> [gen2] niki, don't delete it. Just rename the first one to .OLD then add the source compiled version.
[11:12] <n1gke> [gen2] niki, if something then goes wrong with the new compile, then rename the .OLD to its original.
[11:12] <[gen2] niki> i mean
[11:12] <[gen2] niki> if i try to uninstall it with synaptic
[11:12] <[gen2] niki> x-x
[11:13] <babo> does ethereal need X to run ?
[11:13] <n1gke> I had to something like that with CWIRC program as it did not like my othe computer and I didn't want to unload the whole program.
[11:13] <[gen2] niki> hmm
[11:13] <[gen2] niki> so what to do?
[11:13] <POVaddct> babo: yes
[11:13] <POVaddct> babo: but i think there is tethereal
[11:13] <[gen2] niki> libfreetype6 and libfreetype6-dev are installed
[11:13] <n1gke> babo, I run etheral in a terminal window as root
[11:13] <[gen2] niki> if i vanish them, i vanish half of all packages
[11:14] <babo> n1gke: so it doens't need x then ?
[11:14] <babo> cool
[11:14] <thyko> how do i remove an apt-get loclfile?
[11:14] <POVaddct> babo: it does need X
[11:14] <n1gke> thyko, sudo apt-get remove <package-name>
[11:15] <babo> n1gke: runs it in terminal ... ?
[11:15] <POVaddct> n1gke: just because you can run it from a terminal you still need that terminal running in a X session
[11:15] <jc750kwak> Anyone know how to get the operator keys on my numpad working in Kubuntu? They work in Ubuntu after setting the keymap in Gconf but all I can get in Kubuntu are the numbers, not / * - or +
[11:15] <trogdoor> zsh: http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/13/ubuntu-to-kubuntu-keeping-the-menus-clean/
[11:15] <thyko> it says 'another application is using the packaging system'
[11:15] <n1gke> true because it is a gui type program as is etherape.
[11:15] <POVaddct> babo: i think tethereal is the text version of ethereal
[11:15] <zsh> trogdoor, cool, thanks
[11:15] <thyko> but i just rebooted the box
[11:15] <trogdoor> zsh: np
[11:16] <zsh> n1gke, shadowfalx, thanks guys
[11:16] <babo> POVaddct: so I can run ethereal on my remote server but use the interface here on my desktop ?
[11:16] <n1gke> thyko, in a terminal window, use the command ps ax to see what the process numbe of the other package manager is
[11:16] <shadowfalx> not a problem zsh
[11:16] <savvas> what's opera's ubuntu repository?
[11:16] <POVaddct> babo: when logging in via ssh with X forwarding, yes
[11:16] <n1gke> thyko, then in the terminal window CAREFULLY use kill ####
[11:17] <n1gke> thyko, sometimes when ADEPT closes out, it stays in memory and I can not use aptitude and apt-get.
[11:17] <POVaddct> babo: but you have to run a local X server to do that

[11:26] <bilss_> POYaddct thanks , any ideas on tar problem i posted before
[11:26] <kamui> trogdoor: some index files failed to download, they have been ignored or old ones used instead.
[11:26] <trogdoor> kamui: Are you connected to the internet?
[11:26] <POVaddct> bilss_: you tar command line makes no sense. what are you trying to do?
[11:26] <Xtreme> trogdoor, i dont know the difference i tried installing beryl yesterday but it would only work with the "nv" driver not nvidia one, and i like haveing the nvidia for games
[11:27] <kamui> trogdoor: yes, Im on the laptop im trying to upgrade typing to you now
[11:27] <raghu206> shadowfalx, when i turnoff my system the whole process in backgound goes well but atlast cusor blinks on blank bckgound and there no automatic shut down
[11:27] <bilss_> POYaddct: tmp# tar xvfz ossec-hids-0.9-2.tar.gz
[11:27] <trogdoor> Xtreme: it works the other way around, beryl ONLY works with nvidia, not with nv
[11:27] <POVaddct> bilss_: tar xzf ossec-hids-0.9-2.tar.gz
[11:27] <bilss_> gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
[11:27] <bilss_> tar: Child returned status 1
[11:27] <bilss_> tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
[11:28] <shadowfalx> humm, are you on a laptop of desktop raghu206?
[11:28] <raghu206> shadowfalx, desktop i use edgy
[11:28] <POVaddct> bilss_: the file is probably damaged or downloaded wrong
[11:28] <Xtreme> trogdoor,  no clue then when i try to start "beryl-manager" from gnome it crashes the windows and i cant click the taskbar have to restart x
[11:29] <trogdoor> kamui: Strange, try: sudo apt-get update again just to be sure, if it doesn't work pastebin the output.
[11:29] <crimsun> JayFM: I can if you don't mind using a terminal, a non-gui editor, and wpa supplicant directly
[11:29] <POVaddct> bilss_: try: file ossec-hids-0.9-2.tar.gz
[11:29] <JayFM> If you provide assistance during those things, i can do that.
[11:29] <shadowfalx> hum, I have know idea raghu206. if you have other OSs they shut down fine?
[11:29] <bilss_> POYaddct: ossec-hids-0.9-2.tar.gz: HTML document text
[11:30] <raghu206> shadowfalx, i got XP it shuts down fine
[11:30] <POVaddct> bilss_: its a html page, not an archive
[11:31] <crimsun> JayFM: do you have all the necessary information readily available?
[11:31] <POVaddct> bilss_: something went wrong during download
[11:31] <prada> I am trying to install Ubuntu on new a second HDD. During the Partition stage, I get an error that says "Unable to instal selected Kernel"
[11:31] <JayFM> As in SSID and passphrase, etc?
[11:31] <JayFM> Yeah, i do.
[11:31] <shadowfalx> raghu206, not sure then, thought maybe it was hardware issue, doesn't look like it though. have you tryed a reboot?
[11:31] <Xtreme> trogdoor, i shall try starting "beryl-manager" now and see how it goes
[11:31] <bilss_> POYaddct what i did was  wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-0.9-2tar.gz
[11:31] <trogdoor> Xtreme: what directions did you follow?
[11:31] <JayFM> + I have an ethernet connection to the router.
[11:32] <POVaddct> bilss_: did you download this from sourceforce? you cannot use the download links at sourceforge directly, you have to choose a mirror and d'load it from there.
[11:32] <kamui> trogdoor: I can't pastebin, is there a way I can pipe the content to a text file to send?  >> output.txt doesn't get everything
[11:32] <shadowfalx> raghu206: as in goto tty1 and login as root, then run reboot comand
[11:32] <kamui> trogdoor: I've got no X and no console mouse support
[11:32] <raghu206> shadowfalx, rebot works fine
[11:32] <bilss_> POYaddct; no its not sourceforce
[11:32] <POVaddct> bilss_: btw, why installing it from a tarball? is there no ubuntu package for it?
[11:33] <bilss_> no
[11:33] <crimsun> JayFM: ok, first thing you'll need to do is make sure you're _not_ using network-manager, meaning you should not have any network-manager* packages installed.
[11:33] <shadowfalx> raghu206: have you tryed shutdown from comand line?
[11:33] <bilss_> POYaddct: http://howtoforge.com/intrusion_detection_with_ossec_hids
[11:33] <JayFM> Okay, i was in one, but i exited out of it. Do i need to get another, or will i just be editing files?
[11:33] <trogdoor> kamui: Does it mention 404 anywhere?
[11:33] <Xtreme> trogdoor, failed
[11:33] <raghu206> shadowfalx, it too sucks
[11:34] <trogdoor> Xtreme: what directions did you follow to install Beryl?
[11:34] <Xtreme> http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/XGL
[11:34] <crimsun> JayFM: in one what?
[11:34] <shadowfalx> raghu206: maybe a kernel or bash problem, not sure though, sorry
[11:34] <POVaddct> bilss_: and which one do you want to download?
[11:34] <another> the next and previous song shortcut keys in gnome don't work with rhythmbox?
[11:34] <kamui> trogdoor: no, it seems to be saying that the packages are not in gzip format
[11:35] <JayFM> In a network manager.. The one that came with uBuntu. System > Administration > networking.
[11:35] <trogdoor> Xtreme: I don't know then, try #ubuntu-xgl
[11:35] <kamui> trogdoor: sub process gzip returned error code (1)
[11:35] <prada> Look not Many women Use Linux. Be nice to the ones that do...Strange
[11:35] <bilss_> POYaddct:

[11:35] <trogdoor> kamui: A lot of people have been having that problem today.
[11:36] <crimsun> JayFM: oh, that's fine. We're talking about the gnome applet that attempts to take over. I don't have much love for it.
[11:36] <kamui> trogdoor: so, should I wait? keep trying? or just reinstall Dapper Drake?
[11:36] <trogdoor> kamui: On what repositories is it having a problem?
[11:36] <crimsun> JayFM: first things first: Can you connect to open APs successfully?
[11:36] <POVaddct> bilss_: 0.9.2 is gone, 0.9.3 is lastest. look here: http://www.ossec.net/files/
[11:36] <crimsun> JayFM: also, what wifi chipset do you use?
[11:36] <trogdoor> kamui: you can try: sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update.
[11:37] <JayFM> Yes. Although, they're not myne, so i don't like spending too much time on them.
[11:37] <JayFM> Two seconds, i'll find out.
[11:37] <kamui> trogdoor: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com edgy/universe packages
[11:37] <trogdoor> kamui: I would keep trying.

[11:58] <mikeymike-linux> what is gnome settings daemon?
[11:58] <porkpie> rdk: -f doesn't work either
[11:58] <Dab> ./ cpk1?
[11:59] <cpk1> Dab: to run a sh ./nameof.sh
[11:59] <netpython> mikeymike-linux, for example changing the theme

[11:59] <webben> Does anyone know a Linux program for comparing TrueType/OpenType fonts installed on your system that doesn't suck?
[11:59] <mikeymike-linux> no alt tab...........
[11:59] <mikeymike-linux> no ctrl alt left/right
[11:59] <mikeymike-linux> nothing.
[11:59] <porkpie> rdk:the packages are there if I search in the cache but they don't install :(
[11:59] <mikeymike-linux> its highly annoying.
[11:59] <webben> e.g. display some specified text in multiple fonts simultaneously
[12:00] <mikeymike-linux> my mouse scroll wheel does nothing on the desktop (it's supposed to change viewports)
[12:00] <cpk1> Dab: you said you had a file named linux-installer.sh so go to the directory its in and do ./linux-installer.sh
[12:00] <porkpie> rdk:maybe I should use the tar files

[12:00] <SV452> can someone be so kind as to explain how exactly the upgrade system works for ubuntu .... like dapper has lts while edgy is only 18 months i think ??
[12:00] <mikeymike-linux> it doesn't matter if im in beryl or metacity

[12:02] <porkpie> E: Invalid operation libnet-ssleay-perl

[12:02] <Dab> how do i just open a terminal?
[12:02] <cpk1> porkpie: apt-get install
[12:02] <rkd> porkpie: just apt-get install libnet-ssleay-perl and try dpkg again
[12:03] <DarkMageZ> Dab, in the top left. applications > accessories > terminal
[12:03] <webben> Or for that matter, does anyone know of way to get fonts looking as nice in openoffice as in gedit?
[12:03] <Dab> thanks now im away
[12:03] <Dab> play this without a graphics driver first :-)
[12:03] <porkpie> rkd:You might want to run `apt-get -f install' to correct these:
[12:03] <porkpie> The following packages have unmet dependencies:

[12:03] <porkpie> Depends: libio-pty-perl but it is not going to be installed
[12:03] <porkpie> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[12:04] <Dab> hmm hang on i typed ./linux-installer.sh correctly
[12:04] <cpk1> well i would do what it says porkpie =)
[12:04] <Dab> this file is on unreal tournament 2004 dvd ,
[12:04] <freakstyle> porkpie, apt-get -f install; apt-get remove --purge webmin; apt-get clean; apt-get install what_you_need;

[12:04] <stephano> how can I install Gaim 2.0 beta4 on Edgy?
[12:04] <freakstyle> anyone? :)
[12:05] <Flannel> freakstyle: webmin is no longer maintained, and is no longer in the repositories
[12:05] <freakstyle> Flannel, ok :*
[12:05] <Dab> wonder if i can copy it from dvd
[12:05] <anto9us> Dab, cd /media/cdrom and try again
[12:05] <Dab> ok
[12:05] <anto9us> Dab, then type ./l and press tab, it should complete the command for you :)
[12:05] <Flannel> freakstyle: oh, sorry.  Thought you said 'don't see webmin' not don't need it.  I'll stop paying attention only halfway ;)

[12:12] <Dab> well since this is not open source click and drag the file is the most simple for me
[12:12] <crimsun> KenSentMe: no. In that case, you just need to change the default audio device by using System> Preferences> Sound> [middle tab]  > Set default sound card
[12:12] <Dab> when i do that it comes up as Permission denied
[12:12] <Dab> when i press enter
[12:13] <KenSentMe> crimsun: but i want to use the default device for everything else, except this one program

[12:13] <anto9us> Dab, right click it and select properties
[12:13] <Dab> it says i am not the owner so i can't change these permissions
[12:13] <crimsun> KenSentMe: so change it just before you start Rhythmbox, then change it back.
[12:14] <anto9us> Dab, are there any instructions on installing to Linux on that CD?
[12:14] <Dab> i can read the game manual at least

[12:16] <anto9us> phenex, execute it with sudo first time then set it's input/output devices
[12:16] <crimsun> phenex: audacity in edgy doesn't support alsa natively. It uses /dev/dsp.
[12:16] <Dab> can i boot this linux-installer.sh with a text editor?
[12:16] <Dab> O_o
[12:16] <phenex> anto9us, no way to set it under sudo either
[12:16] <phenex> crimsun, so what can i do? can i link dsp to snd or something?
[12:16] <Dab> what i am trying to install is a game thats not open source, and made by a game company ,and this game is called unreal tournament 2004
[12:17] <anto9us> phenex, there's a package I think you may need, perhaps it's aoss

[12:24] <anto9us> phenex, do you have the correct device selected for recording in your mixer?
[12:24] <Dab> however i found this, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1675812
[12:24] <crimsun> Michae1: the best supported depends on your wifi chipset if in fact you're referring to wifi at all.
[12:24] <wwwdotcom> hello
[12:24] <phenex> anto9us, where in my mixer? :P
[12:24] <giesen> I guess it's not the end of the world if I have to wait till april

[12:24] <anto9us> phenex, double click the volume control icon
[12:24] <giesen> since I dont use the modem all the much

[12:26] <crimsun> giesen: there's no bug id afaik.
[12:26] <anto9us> phenex, depends on your sound-card, also, I use a different mixer than standard, can't reference easily, but select the recording device, and I suggest exploring a little :)

[12:35] <anto9us> Dab, you'll get a lot more conversation, usually, in #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[12:35] <KriS83> there are acutally two patches if I get it right
[12:35] <sticazzi> hello. I'm having trouble with the Ubuntu installation. The installer did not install GRUB properly. I've explained the issue further here with a diagram of the HDD setup: http://cimarosti.googlepages.com/grubproblem
[12:35] <crimsun> KriS83: that change is already in alsa-driver 1.0.13
[12:35] <j2daosh> anto9us: what is the soundcard setup command?
[12:35] <Dab> i really just want to get the drivers sorted out and then play a game ,
[12:36] <Dab> don't want to learn code really im a gamer,
[12:36] <KriS83> so thats for feisty? only? or how/where can I get hold of alsa-driver 1.0.13?
[12:36] <crimsun> KriS83: it has not been merged into ubuntu-edgy, since kernel freeze was early october.
[12:36] <KriS83> ahh k
[12:36] <crimsun> KriS83: ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-1.0.13.tar.bz2
[12:36] <anto9us> j2daosh, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound
[12:37] <Xtreme> how do you change the colours of the taskbars and icons in beryl ??
[12:37] <blinx> what is lrm-video?
[12:37] <ramin> so is this correct
[12:38] <ramin> sudo mv/home/ramin/Desktop/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[12:38] <KriS83> ke, I'll give it a try then. Want feedback on it? or rather not? :)
[12:38] <ramin> its not functioning right though
[12:39] <Dab> i have a problem when i click on the application on application> other the box just appears and dissapear
[12:39] <jeronim> is there some simple way to check that what dpkg thinks is installed is what's *really* installed, for all packages?
[12:40] <festis2k> heya?
[12:40] <jeronim> bc dpkg was quite deluded about vim being at version 7 after dist-upgrade
[12:40] <jeronim> which broke
[12:40] <ramin> Iam trying to put flash 9 beta on linux
[12:40] <ramin> so it works in firefox
[12:41] <anto9us> jeronim, you need to complete the upgrade else it will remain confused
[12:41] <ramin> what do u suggest
[12:41] <Jellybean> Where can I get a list of the kernel patches applied to the ubuntu kernel compared to the vanilla kernel?
[12:41] <georgeb> !flash9
[12:41] <ubotu> Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[12:41] <jeronim> i did dist-upgrade with apt-get after it broke
[12:41] <iami89> do you know where to get ati radeon driver for linux?
[12:41] <festis2k> anyone that can answer a couple of questions?
[12:41] <AlanHaggai> !ati
[12:41] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:41] <ramin> ATI drivers on their site
[12:41] <iami89> download
[12:41] <ramin> I have ATI
[12:41] <godvirus> how do i see what packages are available/installed?
[12:41] <iami89> not install
[12:41] <jeronim> and tried apt-get --reinstall install  for the vim packages, and they still were the wrong version -- only uninstall and then install fixed vim
[12:42] <godvirus> on command line
[12:42] <Dab> i would prefer nvidia over ati on linux
[12:42] <iami89> i want ati driver for linux ubuntu
[12:42] <Dab> ati drivers for linux, nvidias are better on the world of linux
[12:42] <godvirus> Q: how do i tell what packages are installed/available on the command line?
[12:42] <Rothbuntu> i have an x1400 and not any serious issues yet
[12:43] <georgeb> godvirus: sodu dpkg -l
[12:43] <Raskall> hmm.. how do I force edgy to use mplayerplug-in for WMV-files instead of the totem-plugin.
[12:43] <georgeb> godvirus: sudo dpkg -l
[12:43] <godvirus> apt-get uses dpkg?
[12:43] <itsx> hi:)
[12:43] <roryy> godvirus: aptitude search '~i' is one way.  'dpkg -l|grep ^ii' is another.
[12:43] <Rothbuntu> totem is CRAP
[12:44] <godvirus> wow roryy thanks
[12:44] <Raskall> Rothbuntu: I know, but somehow it got installed by default. and when I try to remove it with apt-get, it insistes on removing the ubuntu-desktop package too
[12:44] <Skaag> can someone help me understand why DISPLAY is not being set on a remote host when I do "ssh -X hostname"? (I want my X to display an app running on the remote server)
[12:44] <itsx> is it possible to run sudo in gnome (without terminal)
[12:44] <Rothbuntu> yeah same
[12:44] <Rothbuntu> ahh
[12:44] <georgeb> godvirus: dpkg handles deb's, packages, apt-get is more like a frontend for dealing with repos, etc
[12:44] <roryy> godviurs: alternatively just run 'aptitude' and use the 'text' gui; it's pretty good.
[12:44] <ramin> Thanks you so much, .debs work much better
[12:45] <godvirus> awesome, thanks. im new to ubuntu/debian
[12:46] <anto9us> Skaag, does it give you an error?
[12:46] <ramin> when I right click on a flash applet in firefox, it still gives me macromedia flash player 7 instead of 9
[12:46] <markus_> Skaag: is X tunneling enabled on the server?
[12:47] <rhican> ramin delete the .xpt file
[12:47] <ramin> which is where?
[12:47] <Keigo-kun> How do I install the server version of ubuntu from an ubuntu dapper lifeCD
[12:47] <Keigo-kun> *live
[12:48] <rhican> ramin, not sure on ubuntu but in one of the plugin dirs
[12:48] <ramin> k
[12:48] <Skaag> markus_: yes: X11Forwarding yes
[12:48] <Skaag> markus_: I even tried ssh -Y
[12:48] <ramin> cause, I am trying to view some flash videos on for example myspace and it doesnt even show those right
[12:48] <Skaag> markus_: I also tried forcing DISPLAY=localhost:10.0
[12:49] <gyro_54> Hi all - I am trying to setup Java on Opera and it has asked for the path which I have as /usr/share/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.08/ but I'm not sure which file it is looking for. Any ideas?
[12:49] <what_if> does anyone knoe of a commandline program that returns the IP address of a DNS name ??
[12:49] <markus_> Skaag: strange
[12:49] <roryy> what_if: 'dig'
[12:50] <BlueEagle> what_if: if ping doesn't reply then dig is an alternative.
[12:50] <what_if> roryy: but I need only the ip back
[12:50] <Skaag> markus_: indeed!
[12:50] <Sarkie> Hi all, I am still having problems connecting to my Wireless router, anyone here
[12:50] <cpk1> i suppose tracepath will tell you the ip =P
[12:50] <Sarkie> That isnt english, meh
[12:50] <what_if> what_if: feeding into the 'ip' program which does not accepd DN's
[12:50] <BlueEagle> what_if: You can awk and grep the output from dig
[12:51] <Sarkie> Hi all, I am still having problems connecting to my Wireless router, I have installed Network Manager, but the WPA key doesnt get accepted and then I dont get an ip or anything
[12:51] <anto9us> Skaag, check the ownership of files in your home directory
[12:51] <what_if> BlueEagle: that could work (this will take a while)
[12:51] <ramin> wait, how do ichange the permissions for a folder
[12:51] <ramin> directory
[12:51] <Skaag> anto9us: how does that affect things?
[12:51] <cpk1> Sarkie: anyone here that isnt english? there are other #ubuntu channels for different languages...
[12:52] <festis2k> The only thing I would like to know are if its hard for a beginner to install a webserver on ubuntu, currently running w2k but would like to have better preformance!
[12:52] <anto9us> Skaag, I just remember seeing a problem like this before, managed to get root ownership of a file, can't remember which that stopped X forwarding from working
[12:52] <Sarkie> cpk1: I am English, I just got side tracked mid conversation and it made me write gibberish
[12:52] <Skaag> anto9us: I see, that's interesting
[12:52] <fblade> hey guys
[12:52] <rhican> i had a problem my ubuntu box right now, for some reason a few files in /bin were messed up beyond repair preventing users logging in to DE, anybody an idea why that happened ? just ext3 to blame?
[12:52] <ramin> file permissions anyone?
[12:53] <cpk1> chmod?
[12:53] <georgeb> ramin: man chmod
[12:53] <BlueEagle> what_if: Just make a bash script out of it, but do be aware that not all nameservers do return the information you do need.
[12:54] <georgeb> festis2k: it's not hard to install a webserver; the difficult part is configure it and secure the machine :)
[12:55] <fblade> guys wonder if you can help me? i want to be able to use my ubuntu box at my uni campus but they have what i thnk wpa2 encryption the one where you have to have a user name and password to loggin can this be done on linux?
[12:55] <Dab> heh ill just use this for more performance running a commercial game
[12:55] <georgeb> fblade: I don't think that WPA2 is with username and password; maybe pppoe ?
[12:55] <BlueEagle> what_if: ping -c 1 ns.online.no|grep "bytes of data"|awk {'print $3'}|sed s/\(//|sed s/\)//
[12:56] <fblade> im not sure but on windows box i have to configure windows to accept wpa2
[12:56] <georgeb> !wifi
[12:56] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:57] <Cyber_Stalker> whats with all the joins and parts?
[12:57] <BlueEagle> what_if: What that does is that it pings the host once and grabs the first line which does contain the IP address as the 3rd word. Then awk pulls that word out and then sed first removes the ( and then removes the ) that surrounds the ip address.
[12:57] <georgeb> fblade: take a look at the above documentation; WPA2 should work, but there might be problems with the drivers for the Wifi card
[12:57] <BlueEagle> what_if: It should be possible to remove awk completely if you know more regex than I do.
[12:57] <arcad3> i have a question.if i have an FREE DynamicDNS www.arcad3.dyndns.com can i make www.example.arcad3.dyndns.com from apache??
[12:57] <fblade> okies ta
[12:57] <BlueEagle> what_if: (ie just use sed)
[12:58] <netpython> what_if, host
[12:58] <georgeb> what_if:  BlueEagle: host should work; ie host ns.online.no
[12:59] <zugu> hello
[12:59] <arcad3> or i must have a paied DNS parked to my nameservers?
[12:59] <Dab> this distro could do with automatic mounting installs
[12:59] <Dab> :0)
[12:59] <cpk1> it does automount...
[12:59] <Keigo-kun> Can anyone help me do a server install of Ubuntu from a Dapper LiveCD?
[01:00] <Dab> well when haveing to run it in a terminal
[01:00] <georgeb> arcad3: if www.example.arcad3.dyndns.com pointing to you ip; take a look ar virtual hosts in apache documentation
[01:00] <ramin> isnt there a way to just be in root mode in GUI instead of shell
[01:00] <zugu> I'm running Dapper, but I cannot find recent versions of the applications I use the most - such as Firefox 2, VLC 0.8.5 or Gaim 2 beta; can anyone tell me why?
[01:00] <Dab> it just gives me error and 2 codes for options
[01:00] <Dab> and it leaves me stuck
[01:00] <Dab> :-)
[01:00] <Keigo-kun> zugu: you need to upgrade to edgy repositories
[01:00] <antox> what can prevent /etc/iftab from influencing a name of a certain interface? I use mac selector, but anyway the iface stays eth0. :?
[01:00] <arcad3> georgeb:yes it points
[01:00] <zugu> Keigo-kun, won't this break my system?
[01:01] <rNIUS> hello :)
[01:01] <arcad3> but doesn.t recognize it gives me the default page
[01:01] <arcad3> i configured fine apache
[01:01] <BlueEagle> georgeb: You're right.
[01:01] <zugu> Keigo-kun, also, does this mean that the Dapper repos will be receiving security updates only?
[01:01] <Dab> plus it could be a tad easier on new users and could do with a straight forward, click here to install,
[01:02] <Dab> like exe.
[01:02] <burnproof> good day, guys has anyone from you know what browser really support SRV lookup?
[01:02] <Dab> multiple folders in this patch file
[01:02] <ramin> guys, i have to restart firefox, will be right back
[01:02] <Dab> ah wait there a txt file
[01:02] <Phille> tjena p et
[01:02] <BlueEagle> what_if: as georgeb sais: host would be better. That means that you need the 4th word that's returned by host and that's done by host ns.online.no|awk {'print $4'}
[01:02] <Phille> *er
[01:02] <Keigo-kun> zugu: I don't know really. I just know that to get Firefox 2.0 etc I had to upgrade to edgy.
[01:03] <big_c> oh herro
[01:03] <zugu> I'm running Dapper, but I cannot find recent versions of the applications I use the most - such as Firefox 2, VLC 0.8.5 or Gaim 2 beta; can anyone tell me why?
[01:03] <Dab> well guess i could click and drag and enter into terminal see if it does anything
[01:03] <Dab> hmm no just opens
[01:03] <BlueEagle> what_if: Now if you make a script of this you might want to check if word 4 is "found:" because if it is then the host wasn't found.
=== cherubiel is now known as theWind
[01:04] <Dab> i have found a ut 2004 bin file
[01:04] <Dab> see if that responds
=== theWind is now known as cherubiel
[01:04] <georgeb> BlueEagle: from what I know there is one drawback to this solution; host doesn't resolve hosts setup in /etc/hosts; it will always ask the dns server
[01:05] <ramin> it worked, I had to configure the .deb and restart firefox
[01:05] <ramin> and now everything on flash works
[01:05] <mepa|Yancho> how can one get a whole directly over ftp pls ?
[01:05] <Dab> do i have to click and drag and replace files i guess
[01:05] <ramin> thanks to whoever gave me that link
[01:05] <georgeb> mepa|Yancho: what ftp client do you use ?
[01:05] <ramin> use should use filezilla
[01:05] <mepa|Yancho> georgeb ftp command line interface
[01:06] <BlueEagle> georgeb: Well for this application it won't matter much as he's looking for a nameserver and such a nameserver would be defined in itself if he's looking for the IP of the local one.
[01:06] <markus_> zugu: new software doesn't go into dapper, only bugfixes. you could enable the backports repository, there are some new apps
[01:06] <BlueEagle> georgeb: s/should/ought to/
[01:06] <chell> hi
[01:06] <ramin> filezilla, open source and everything
[01:06] <zugu> markus_, thank you
[01:06] <chell> I've just noticed that I have a floppy drive in my computer menu that doesn't exist. How do I get rid of it?
[01:06] <markus_> zugu: no problem
[01:06] <georgeb> mepa|Yancho: try mget folder
[01:07] <mepa|Yancho> georgeb its giving me : 550 'statsfile' : No Such File.
[01:08] <Dab> is this new ubuntu 6.10 edgye or not?
[01:08] <netpython> Dab,yes
[01:08] <Dab> kk
[01:09] <|Kermit|> i have some problems installing the nvidia beta drivers from amaranth's repository
[01:09] <|Kermit|> if i do apt-get install nvidia-glx i get unresolved dependencies to nvidia-kernel-1.0.9625
[01:09] <Dab> http://albertomilone.com/latest_nvidia_udsf_edgy.html
[01:09] <georgeb> mepa|Yancho: I think it doesn't work; I guess it will not create the folders on the local computer;
[01:09] <markus_> Dab: look at the version number: 6 is for 2006 and 10 is for october
[01:09] <godvirus> Q: is there an easy way to tell what package in the repository has a utliity I'm looking for? Case in point: yacc
[01:09] <georgeb> mepa|Yancho: you could try a different ftp client; if you prefer command line use mc
[01:09] <Dab> yep mine is 6.10
[01:10] <Dab> i really just want to fire up a game and play really
[01:10] <mepa|Yancho> georgeb does mc have an ftp client?

[01:27] <arcad3> what r u trying to do?
[01:27] <Dab> install nvidia graphics drivers
[01:27] <Jester45> can you install a .rpm with dpkg apt or aptitude?
[01:27] <Dab> i don't think ill bother with the audio side, since its ac97 intergrated , and hopefully be 3d sound
[01:27] <cpk1> yes but you probably dont want to Jester45
[01:27] <Dab> stereo
[01:27] <TIger_IT> Try this: >     killall kicker     < Its funy xD
[01:28] <pc4> steve
[01:28] <kalikiana> mepa|Yancho: what r you exactly searching?
[01:28] <Jester45> cpk1: why not
[01:28] <mepa|Yancho> to edit php.ini kalikiana
[01:28] <arcad3> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Xgl.2FCompiz_.28Nvidia.29
[01:28] <BlueEagle> dab: One thing that you will quickly learn about linux (right about now actually) is that sometimes you will actually need to read some documentation to make something work. The reason for this is that, unlike windows, linux runs on several platforms and how something works is rarely the same for all platrorms. Thus you will find that in many cases you need to set up the software to suit your platform.
[01:28] <cpk1> !rpm
[01:28] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[01:29] <Spee_Der> Moo
[01:29] <BlueEagle> dab: Another thing is that linux does enable you to do some very, very stupid things with your system like set up open mail relays and so on and so forth. Thus undestanding the configurations of many applications is very often very important.
[01:29] <arcad3> Dap:or change to dapper repositories
[01:29] <arcad3> apt-get update
[01:29] <Dab> put 1 billion investment into ubuntu, and designed it for desktop users and gamers with automatic install :0)
[01:29] <arcad3> apt-get install nvidia-glx
=== KillerDemon is now known as KillerDemon|slag
[01:29] <Cyber_Stalker> BlueEagle open mail relays?
[01:29] <Jester45> cpk1: so will it break somwthing im not going to uninstall it so im not worries about hat
=== KillerDemon|slag is now known as KlrDmn|slagrooms
[01:30] <Cyber_Stalker> so like i can send emails from my linux box?
[01:30] <mepa|Yancho> mvn kalikiana i found :)
[01:30] <compengi> i removed libgtkhtml-2.0 then installed it, but in application menu the add/remove program vanished, how to get it back?
[01:30] <kalikiana> mepa|Yancho: i was just gonna tell u, so ok :)
[01:30] <cherubiel> quakenul: try after issuing an "unset HTTP_PROXY"
=== KlrDmn|slagrooms is now known as KD|slagroomsoesj
[01:30] <cpk1> Jester45: first what are you trying to install? it is surprising there is an rpm but not a .deb
[01:30] <BlueEagle> cyber_stalker: Not only you but everybody (read: spammers) can send mails from your host.
[01:30] <mepa|Yancho> kalikiana another prob :P how to restart php lol
[01:30] <cherubiel> quakenul: use small letters, my bad. unset http_proxy
[01:30] <Cyber_Stalker> yea
[01:30] <Dab> unreal 2004 does not want to start
[01:30] <chell> how can I enable multilingual spell checking for apps like xchat or gaim?
[01:30] <Cyber_Stalker> im just thinking about using it to send mails
[01:31] <Dab> although installed
[01:31] <Jester45> cpk1: firefox's java plugin i have java on my box but its not working on it
[01:31] <Cyber_Stalker> so i would be able to send mails from like billgates@microsoft.com?
[01:31] <BlueEagle> dab: Do you get an error message? I haven't seen it posted.
[01:31] <kalikiana> mepa|Yancho: hm, that's the one i keep forgettin, sry
[01:31] <Cyber_Stalker> yes i know the replys wont come back to me but any way
[01:31] <Jester45> or it not working with firefox java works becuase im running azureus right now
[01:31] <Dab> no errors, the start up of ut 2004, the box appears and then just closes
[01:31] <Dab> like argh wheres the game
[01:32] <georgeb> Cyber_Stalker: you can send mails from billgates@ms.com from most smtp servers;
[01:32] <cpk1> Jester45: you do *not* need an rpm to install java, you can use apt-get for that
[01:32] <BlueEagle> dab: Have you attempted to start the game from a terminal?
[01:32] <kalikiana> mepa|Yancho: oh, wait, what about sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart
[01:32] <BlueEagle> dab: That ought to give you more information.
[01:32] <Dab> no i can try that
[01:32] <Dab> click and drop
[01:32] <Cyber_Stalker> georgeb most of them are secure thos
[01:32] <Jester45> cpk1: im not running the firefox from apt
[01:32] <Cyber_Stalker> tho*
[01:32] <arcad3> Dab:use this script www.arcad3.uv.ro/auto1.tar.gz
[01:33] <cpk1> Jester45: huh?
[01:33] <Dab> argh not a stupid text again
[01:33] <Dab> try it in terminal
[01:33] <georgeb> Cyber_Stalker: depepnds on what you understand by securing; most of the auth "protocols" of smtp only checks to see that you CAN send mails thru that SMTP server
[01:34] <chell> Is there no way to enable multilingual spellchecking in gaim (like on os x )
[01:34] <meridian73> hi
[01:34] <Dab> yay the terminal option worked
[01:34] <Cyber_Stalker> yea but i mean like, most people have protected there smtp's because of spam and stuff
[01:34] <Dab> woohoo
[01:34] <Cyber_Stalker> spammers abbusing them,
[01:34] <Jester45> ckp1: i removed the firefox that came with ubuntu and put 2.5 on becuase im running drapper
[01:34] <Dab> gave me password prompt
[01:34] <mepa|Yancho> thanks kalikiana .. and one last question pls :)
[01:34] <Dab> what is this script doing
[01:35] <mepa|Yancho> where is the extension folder of php?
[01:35] <Dab> i see it downloading something at 600kb/sec
=== KD|slagroomsoesj is now known as KillerDemon
[01:35] <Cyber_Stalker> lol
[01:35] <Dab> what is this x server?
[01:35] <Cyber_Stalker> nice speed ademan
[01:35] <Cyber_Stalker> Dab*
[01:35] <Jester45> Dab: nice thing to ask after you run it :)
[01:35] <arcad3> the visual server
[01:35] <georgeb> Cyber_Stalker: ie; you have a POP/IMAP account from a domain; but you want to send mails thru your ISPs smtp server because it's faster; the ISP smtp server will check that your IP belongs to them to see if you are a client; or you have to auth yourself with a user/passwd for the ISP server; but most will not check the email address, because they cannot check if you own billgates@ms.com :-)
[01:35] <Dab> well im a numb nuts from windows to this, my Graphics card is the FX series and its fx 5600
[01:36] <Cyber_Stalker> ye

[01:55] <Spee_Der> I kind'a like this Linux version of Opera with IRC built in, it looks nice and clear.
[01:55] <netpython> "route add default gw 192.168.1.24 " on the ubuntu without quotes?
[01:55] <Corbo> with linux, am I right in assuming that if I "cp" the whole filesystem to another drive, and my drive dies, the restore procedure would be to re-install linux, and then cp the whole lot back across?
[01:56] <Daro> Suprano, you can add the dns servers addresses through the file /etc/resolv.conf

[01:56] <Dab> think in the next version of unbuntu, is to make it easy enough to install key stuff like drivers.
[01:56] <mwe> I guess it wont hurt. I'll just try and see if anything breaks
[01:56] <georgeb> arcad3: I changed your script a little to get rid of the gedit thing; here is the first part: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30265/; also, you could create one script for dapper and one for edgy

[01:58] <fishsticks> whaley, im also using liferea right now, its okay, just wondering if there was anything else someone recommended

[02:03] <Dab> well apart from installing stuff, yea this is enough for browsering internet
[02:03] <Dab> the terminal stuff is easy to sh easy or whatever.
[02:04] <donfilipo> has anyone figure it out how to watch streaming videos (example NASA TV etc.) on 6.10Edgy and firefox 2.0????
[02:04] <arcad3> anyone interested in a Cedega?
[02:04] <sticazzi> yajansen, do you just need a firewall machine?
[02:04] <sticazzi> NAT and stuff?
[02:04] <Dab> cegega
[02:04] <Dab> heh well if i had linspire
[02:05] <Dab> im not into codeing
[02:05] <Dab> so im not a long time hardcore programmer on linux
[02:05] <g0d_damn> hi all
[02:05] <knut_> does anybody know, how to run my realtek rtl-8029 network card with ubuntu dapper drake?
[02:05] <netpython> slab requires mono
[02:06] <Dab> without help i really would be stuck on this, well at least i have managed to install ut 2004 on unbuntu
[02:06] <Dab> doesnt run
[02:06] <donfilipo> Dab can you tell me if Cedega works on 6.10?
[02:06] <yajansen> sticazzi: I want to have my machine act as dhcp-server.. that's all
[02:06] <Dab> well if i wanted to test cedega
[02:06] <yajansen> nothing more to it
[02:06] <Dab> ill have to download it from bit torrent
[02:06] <arcad3> cedega is made for gaming in LINUX
[02:06] <fblade> hey guys wonder if you could help im running ubuntu through a lcd monitor connected through dvi and well ern i clic to log off it just puts the monitor on standby and i cant do owt
[02:06] <Dab> without paying for it
[02:06] <Dab> if its there
[02:06] <arcad3> easy to install and works every time
[02:06] <netpython> Dab, what did you run? (the executable as in windows but a bit different)
[02:06] <Dab> no no this ut 2004 can run under linux only
[02:07] <arcad3> Counter Strike 1.6
[02:07] <arcad3> San andreas
[02:07] <Dab> it should start up but it doesnt
[02:07] <arcad3> Dreamwaver
[02:07] <Dab> opens and closes
[02:07] <arcad3> and many others ..
[02:07] <Juz_moi> what's the command to see what are your defaults for a user? things like the default shell?
[02:07] <whaley> arcad3: does it run leisure suit larry? :)
[02:07] <netpython> Dab, try ut or unr and press the tab for completion
[02:07] <donfilipo> arcad3 how fast is cedega ?
[02:08] <sticazzi> yajansen, can't help you then. But if you want to set up a dhcp server within 10 minutes complete with NAT and http caching proxy, get Smoothwall
[02:08] <arcad3> is like playing  games on WIN$
[02:08] <Dab> well
[02:08] <Dab> im a gamer trying to get things to work
[02:08] <yajansen> sticazzi: did you see the pastebin? I don't understand why it gives the error message.. smoothwall, I will take a look
[02:08] <Dab> very new to this
[02:08] <Dab> i care about performance
[02:08] <donfilipo> if cedega run's decent then the gaming problem in linux would be partly solved
[02:09] <arcad3> partly?
[02:09] <Dab> ill look up cedega on bit torrent
[02:09] <arcad3> wait i will make a how to install and share that to you
[02:09] <sticazzi> INTERFACES="eth0"
[02:09] <netpython> better buy it doesn't cost that much
[02:09] <sticazzi> try: /dev/eth0
[02:09] <pockey> exit
[02:10] <Dab> well ive found cedega small 5.2.3. and 5.2.4
[02:10] <yajansen> sticazzi: well this is how they say it should be...
[02:10] <Dab> and cedega 5.2.6.
[02:10] <arcad3> small
[02:10] <rem__> .
[02:10] <arcad3> sucks
[02:10] <Dab> well small
[02:10] <donfilipo> arcad3 not everything runs on cedega and i am afraid it is slower...but i will try it out if it runs on 6.10 and report
[02:10] <Dab> and cedega engine 5.2.4. i mean
[02:11] <Dab> go here and type in cedega
[02:11] <Dab> http://torrentspy.com/
[02:11] <netpython> cedega is cool,hope they will support directx10 too
[02:11] <Dab> there are healhty torrents
[02:11] <Dab> yes if they Support dx 10
[02:11] <Dab> ill likely download Lin spire
[02:11] <Dab> and use there dx 10
[02:11] <netpython> plans are they will
[02:11] <Dab> if so ill try that
[02:11] <Dab> i dislike this install options on linux
[02:11] <netpython> XP wont have dx10
[02:12] <Dab> i just want to fire it up and play really, okay the long time linux uses might not like but for it to work for newbies then yea
[02:12] <klaas> or you could just return to use windows *g

[02:13] <craigermendel> Anyone know if there is such a thing as "su" superuser in Ubuntu?
[02:13] <polytan> hi
[02:13] <coNP> craigermendel: there is sudo, and there is a su, as well
[02:13] <Cyber_Stalker> craigermendel: you mean sudo
[02:13] <Cyber_Stalker> ?
[02:13] <Dab> brb gonna restart
[02:14] <coNP> craigermendel: you can execute any command prefixed (as superuser) with "sudo"
[02:14] <arcad3> cool georgeb
[02:14] <craigermendel> I am encountering a install packet that is asking me to type su into the command line.
[02:14] <coNP> craigermendel: type sudo, and then the command
[02:14] <Daro> Suprano it worked? great
[02:14] <craigermendel> I am guessing that is not working because it is sudo and not su?
[02:14] <coNP> craigermendel: it seems so
[02:15] <craigermendel> Do you know if other versions of Linux use su instead of sudo?
[02:15] <arcad3> www.arcad3.ath.cx Get the radme first.This version of cedega works on all LINUX distros
[02:15] <craigermendel> The directions I see are generally for Linux not specifically for Ubuntu
[02:15] <klaas> just combine sudo + su if you want a superuser shell
[02:15] <coNP> craigermendel: these commands are not the same, however, both commands can give you superuser privileges
[02:16] <[H] 3b0R> hello, when squise one of my panels in gnome together, i get two white things in each end, how do i remove them?
[02:16] <craigermendel> gotcha...thanks for the help!
[02:16] <maticompxp> you can also use "sudo bash" to gain superuser shell
[02:16] <coNP> [H] 3b0R: if you rightclick the panel, and by the properties there is an option if you want to see "hide buttons" or not
[02:16] <georgeb> maticompxp: sudo -s is more "clean" :)

[02:50] <hovinen> Hey, I need some emergency assistance. I'm trying to upgrade from Breezy to Edgy and there's a file conflict:
[02:51] <hovinen> udev depends on volumeid, but volumeid contains a file that is also in udev, so apt-get won't upgrade either.
[02:51] <Vanuatoo_>  I've got ati binary driver installed, and have load dri in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, still no direct rendering.
[02:51] <ixian_> newbie question here.. ive created a bash script to run a program in wine, but when i double click on it, it warns me that "Steam.sh is an executable text file" and i have to click 'Run' to run it. how do i stop that warning?
[02:51] <osa-> dzon: why not install samba-swat (dont know if it's in the package manager).  It's a web based frontend for Samba -- and will ensure that your files get done right
[02:51] <hovinen> Can anyone advise me on what to do? apt-get -f install doesn't work.
[02:51] <Pensacola> are the repositories down?
[02:51] <mcscruff> osa-, so ur saying go back to flash 7?
[02:51] <hovinen> Neither does apt-get install udev, or anything like that
[02:52] <osa-> mcscruff: well ... that's what *I* did .. it stopped the problem :)
[02:52] <mcscruff> osa-, kk,ty
[02:52] <dzon> osa: I can share my files
[02:52] <dzon> and windows can see my printer
[02:52] <dzon> but it cant be used
[02:52] <dzon> because of drivers

[02:52] <mc44> Option "Composite" "0"
[02:52] <mc44> EndSection ' in xorg.conf

[02:55] <jiphex> I've forgotten the root password on my ubuntu box, but its a server installation of edgy, and now I cant seem to get a root shell to change the password, can anyone help?
[02:55] <perl_cont> good

[02:55] <jikanter> ixian: open a terminal, with applications, accessories, terminal
[02:55] <jiphex> ok
[02:55] <ayreon81> then passwd i guess
[02:56] <charles_> surabaya

[02:56] <charles_> medan
[02:56] <jikanter> then type cd ./Desktop
[02:56] <charles_> semarang
[02:56] <miranda82> jrib, i though it was the group name or something... lol... is it in the repos?
[02:56] <jikanter> then chmod u+x ./<name of your script>
[02:56] <hovinen> mc44, I would, but the CD drive on this machine is not working properly. The CD that I burnt works fine in my laptop but won't even mount on the computer in question :-(

[02:58] <mandelum> Hello? Anyone know how to get Breezys screensavers and screensaver selecting system into Edgy, Most of edgys screensaver just gives me a blank screen on this laptop
[02:59] <Tschaka> mandelum imho many screensavers are using openGL, maybe install this first?
[02:59] <avaruus> hi, i've tried building two different (newer) kernels with ubuntu's previous kernelconfig and having network not functioning. dmesg says: "NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out" and "eth0: Transmit timeout, status 00000000 00000260".
[02:59] <jiphex> ayreon81: aha, it was just being slow. it booted into the normal prompt that would come up if i left it with the default options
[03:00] <jiphex> and i cant log in there
[03:00] <jiphex> as i dont know the password
[03:00] <hovinen> mc44, Indeed
[03:00] <avaruus> i doubt there's anything missing in kernel config, but its a possibility too
[03:01] <osa-> i wonder why they did totem as opposed to something like xmms by default
[03:01] <Gengerhim> hi all
[03:01] <mc44> hovinen: dist upgrade to dapper then use the upgrade manager
[03:01] <osa-> hi genger
[03:01] <kalikiana> osa-: xmms is gtk1, that's why it's not included
[03:01] <kalikiana> osa-: and xmms can't use winamp plugins afaik
[03:02] <jiphex> anyone know how i can get a password-less root shell on an edgy server box running lilo?
=== skypa_ is now known as skypa
[03:02] <dcraven> jiphex, I hope not. haha
[03:02] <osa-> kalik: is gtk1 .. what .. nonfree?
[03:03] <rsk> osa-: depracated
[03:03] <Dab> do any of you know how to remove a os from dual booting when in win xp it says i can't because something is useing it to prevent the rest being formatted
[03:03] <rsk> osa-: in favor of gtk2
[03:03] <kalikiana> osa-: gtk1 is just old - you would try to avoid old libs
[03:03] <Dab> .
[03:03] <osa-> hmm
[03:03] <hovinen> mc44, I'm trying that now. Thanks.
[03:03] <kalikiana> osa-: try audacious
[03:03] <Dab> how do u uninstall ubuntu from dual booting?
[03:03] <jiphex> dcraven: I've forgotten my password, and now I cant log on to my box. Are you saying I now have to reinstall then?
[03:04] <osa-> kali: linux convert still struggling .. i love my winAmp with 1 certain audio plugin (wow) ..
[03:04] <jrib> I'm trying to enable nvidia.  README.Debian as well as README.txt for nvidia-glx both claim I should comment  Load "dri"  , but if I run 'nvidia-glx-conf enable', it adds  Load "dri"  to my xorg.conf... what's going on?
[03:04] <sorush20> what programs are there like netnanny
[03:04] <kalikiana> osa-: audacious still has similar plugins and the classic skins http://audacious-media-player.org/Main_Page
[03:04] <michiel> Hello everybody
[03:04] <osa-> this IS more fun than fedora was, though ..
[03:04] <michiel> I have a tiny problem with my text-mode terminal
[03:04] <dcraven> jiphex, no I'm not saying that, but it would be discouraging security-wise if you could get a root shell that easily. You're best solution is to use a LiveCD or something and chroot your / partition to reset the password.
[03:05] <ragnar_123> Hey michiel!
[03:05] <michiel> Hey ragnar_123
[03:05] <Dab> HOW DO I UNINSTALL Ubuntu from my hard disk, without haveing to completey reinstall everything
[03:05] <mc44> jiphex: chosing recovery mode should do that, no?
[03:05] <apokryphos> Dab: no caps please.
[03:05] <jiphex> mc44: I have no idea how to get recovery mode from lilo though
[03:05] <apokryphos> Dab: you can format the partition it's on.
[03:05] <Dab> how, when in win xp it doesnt allow
[03:05] <Gengerhim> <Dab>: by the cd
[03:05] <michiel> Maybe someone could look at this image: http://gamingw.net/pubaccess/28695/badblocks.jpg - the interface block elements are broken, it seems.
[03:05] <apokryphos> Dab: use a partition manager in XP, like Partition Magic.
[03:05] <osa-> he doesnt need the CD to change root
[03:05] <michiel> Does anyone know how I can fix this?
[03:05] <Dab> ok
[03:05] <dzon> dcraven, dosen't work
[03:06] <Dab> thank you
[03:06] <osa-> just boot into recovery
[03:06] <osa-> i mean, no OS .. not even linux .. is secure if someone has physical access to the hardware
[03:06] <jiphex> How do you get into recovery mode from lilo then? is it the rw init= stuff?
[03:06] <mc44> jiphex: use ro single as kernel options?
[03:06] <osa-> you're using lilo
[03:06] <jiphex> k
[03:06] <dflksjlfsjd> What command do I use to dump the contents of an executable?
[03:06] <jiphex> yes
[03:07] <michiel> Maybe there is some way to get full support for those block level elements, or even Unicode, in a text-mode terminal?
[03:07] <jikanter> dlk: objdump
[03:07] <osa-> what mc said ?
[03:07] <jiphex> ill try that
[03:07] <dflksjlfsjd> jikanter: thanks
[03:07] <osa-> heh had a funny one last night .. a guy was in here asking about a network problem .. couple people were trying to help him
[03:08] <osa-> asked him what net driver he had
[03:08] <osa-> he said one thing. pointed him at a tool to maybe help
[03:08] <netpython> !objdump
[03:08] <osa-> then he was like yeah but the linux is on a diff machine
[03:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about objdump - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:08] <osa-> so i was like .. this is a diff machine?  he like .. yeah ..
[03:08] <Tschaka> :D
[03:09] <osa-> turned out his cable modem only allowed one MAC address registered at once
[03:09] <Tschaka> :D:D
[03:09] <michiel> Does anyone at all know of a way to get those block elements working properly in a text-mode terminal?
[03:09] <jrib> netpython: install build-essential, it includes binutils which has objdump.  You can use packages.ubuntu.com to search for packages containing a certain file by the way
[03:09] <michiel> http://gamingw.net/pubaccess/28695/badblocks.jpg - my problem in a text-mode terminal
[03:10] <michiel> It would actually be best if there was some way to also get Unicode support into my text-mode terminal, but I'm not sure if that's even possible.
[03:10] <jiphex> mc44: What do i type when it asks for the root password?
[03:10] <netpython> jrib, tnx

[03:33] <jiphex> so mount, chroot and passwd then?
[03:33] <jiphex> from a livecd
[03:33] <dcraven> jiphex, that's what I'd do.

[03:44] <webben> Naked_Snake, http://yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialAOL.html might help
[03:44] <sentine1> when I start up, my NTFS drives are mounted, but I can't see files with an umlaut. after umount -a and mount -a everything's fine again.
[03:44] <Naked_Snake> Sweet
[03:44] <penguin42> Naked_Snake: There also seems to be a package called 'penggy' - 'connects to AOL via modem or TCP/IP'
[03:44] <kalikiana> Naked_Snake: You could just as well enter the dialin parameters into the default tools...
[03:45] <revoker> Naked_Snake: Google said "PengAOL is simply a Linux replacement for the AOL software."
[03:45] <Naked_Snake> Oh
[03:45] <Naked_Snake> kalikiana : you sure?

[03:47] <kalikiana> Naked_Snake: When I used AOL once, i didn't like the software and dialin without it is even faster

[03:47] <wilman_> it works

[03:50] <Mikel0> dcraven, its like an iso file....
[03:50] <doccy> im trying to mount a usb pendrive but linux keeps telling me theres not a fat filesystem on the device - any ideas how i can diagnose this problem?
[03:50] <Justy-> Hello
[03:50] <anto9us> Mikel0, hmm.. maybe in iso format, try renaming it as .iso file, then archive manager may open it

[03:55] <kingace> hello, I was wondering if there was such thing as a way to make a "Run as Sudo\Root" (or similar) context menu button
[03:55] <kingace> so that I dont need to go into terminal every time i want to run something as root
[03:56] <Justy-> Is Edgy support given here ?
[03:56] <kalikiana> kingace: what exactly are you searching for? you might put 'gksudo' in a desktop file
[03:56] <rikai> Justy-, edgy is a stable release now, so yes.
[03:56] <rikai> kingace, gnome? get a nautilus script for sudo.
[03:57] <cherubiel> kingace: gksudo
[03:57] <kingace> rikai: where can I find this, yes I'm on gnome
[03:57] <anto9us> kingace, system tools menu has "run as different user"
[03:58] <Icarosaurus> hello all
[03:58] <sentine1> ethercat: it can't be fstab, since mount -a works
[03:58] <doccy> im trying to mount a usb pendrive but linux keeps telling me theres not a fat filesystem on the device - any ideas how i can diagnose this problem?
[03:58] <rikai> kingace, http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/
[03:58] <Justy-> Thanks, so I have a small problem I think.. When I try to upgrade to Edgy from 6.06 LTS with ' gksu "update-manager -c" ' , I get an error : Failed to fetch http://tr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/multiverse/source/Sources.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1) .. Could you help me solve this problem?
[03:59] <Icarosaurus> anyone uses fglrx 8.30.3 here?
[03:59] <sentine1> me
[03:59] <kingace> rikai: thanks
[03:59] <Naked_Snake> I am too retarded to figure out how to use the dial-up program
[03:59] <sentine1> @ lcarosaurus:
[03:59] <Icarosaurus> can you set custom modelines correctly, sentine1 ?
[03:59] <sentine1> erhm
[03:59] <Naked_Snake> It keeps telling me I suck and don't know how to use it
[03:59] <sentine1> can't start control panel
[03:59] <kingace> rikai: actually that page is down for me
[04:00] <Naked_Snake> AKA : you have a modem, you tell me it's there, you assume you know what you're doing but I INSIST there is no modem in your computer! HA!
[04:00] <kung> someone around, who is familiar with upstart?

[04:01] <Icarosaurus> someone has working fglrx 8.30.3 drivers?
=== Alpha3 is now known as sCsI
[04:02] <dcraven> n00mz, install the -dev package for cairo?
[04:03] <rikai> kingace, well, guess you'll have to wait for it to come back up ^.^;
[04:03] <hoelk_> can anyone help me? i want to mark a fodler on a fat32 hard disc as hidden
[04:03] <hoelk_> (renaming to .fodlername is not an option)
[04:03] <n00mz> dcraven, the one I installed I got off gtk.org.  its package they said was needed
[04:03] <kingace> rikai: yeah, thanks for your help anyway though
[04:04] <n00mz> dcraven, I'll try get the -dev though
[04:04] <kingace> ill bookmark that
[04:04] <rikai> kingace, sourceforge as a whole seems to be down, should be back in a few hours. :)
[04:04] <kingace> yup
[04:05] <SeaD> Hi all, i need help installing Ubuntu trough a netboot image. Is it possible to setup a local mirror, because the ubuntu setup want's to access the internet and download the needed files from there. I dont'have a Internet connection on that networl... any suggestions?
[04:05] <qubix____> anyone know why if i run beryl/xgl my gl/3d screensavers wont run but if i choose metacity/gnome as window manager they will?????
[04:06] <penguin42> SeaD: I'd have thought you could do it with a mirror - but I'm not sure how; have you considered installing on another machine somewhere more convenient than installing the image with partimage or the like?
[04:06] <apokryphos> !beryl | qubix____
[04:06] <ubotu> qubix____: beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[04:07] <apokryphos> SeaD: I think there's instructions on the wiki, have you checked /msg ubotu install ?
[04:07] <n00mz> dcraven, cairo and cairo-dev are already installed
[04:07] <penguin42> what an odd name for a window manager
[04:07] <lupine_85> and obviously, "metacity" makes sense :p
[04:07] <apokryphos> penguin42: 90% of GNU/Linux names are odd 8)
[04:07] <apokryphos> kwin does, w00t
[04:07] <lupine_85> GNU's Not Unix
[04:07] <lupine_85> so ner
[04:08] <lupine_85> :p
[04:08] <penguin42> apokryphos: Well true
[04:08] <dcraven> n00mz, those missing defs are defined in /usr/include/cairo/cairo.h
[04:08] <SeaD> Is it also possible to mount (hd0,0)/ubuntu as a CD-ROM device in GRUB?
[04:08] <lupine_85> it depends whether you asociate beryl with "ur gran" oR "pretty sparkly", I guess
[04:08] <apokryphos> penguin42: they're just using crystal-like names for all their components; theme manager is "emerald"
[04:09] <penguin42> SeaD: How do you mean as a cdrom?
[04:09] <lupine_85> there's a bad joke about beryl crashing, but.. yeah
[04:09] <rikai> SeaD, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LocalNet perhaps?
[04:09] <dcraven> n00mz, which is in libcairo2-dev
[04:09] <Justy-> Thanks, so I have a small problem I think.. When I try to upgrade to Edgy from 6.06 LTS with ' gksu "update-manager -c" ' , I get an error : Failed to fetch http://tr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/multiverse/source/Sources.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1) .. I have searched google and find only one "thread" about it but I was not able to understand.Could you help me solve this problem?
[04:10] <Tonren> Oh man... Edgy is blazing fast.  This was worth the trouble!
[04:10] <SeaD> penguin42, i want to map or mount a map like (hd0,0)/ubuntu from my hdd as a CD-ROM device... is this possible? Cus, my machine does not have a CD-ROM device
[04:10] <SeaD> then i can just copy the CD files on my HDD in the map C:\ubuntu\
[04:10] <lupine_85> Justy-: temporary solution would be to comment out the deb-src line in sources.list which includes the multiverse repository
[04:10] <SeaD> the grub (DOS version)
=== amerdakka_ is now known as eXistenZ
[04:11] <n00mz> dcraven, yeah its there.  I'm not experienced with libraries and such.  how do I get gtk to recognise that?
[04:11] <iter> SeaD: how you going to copy from cd if you don't have a cdrom ?
[04:11] <SeaD> iter, network ;)
[04:11] <SeaD> Windows 98
[04:11] <SeaD> ;P
[04:11] <n00mz> recognise the cairo defs, I mean
[04:11] <Hotkey> HI Newbie here - got my cd - want to install on XP PC - will the install set up a dual boot for me?
[04:11] <lupine_85> wow, win98
[04:11] <SeaD> I'm able to copy the files...
[04:11] <SeaD> :)
[04:11] <lupine_85> :/me pats his 95OSR2 CD
[04:11] <penguin42> SeaD: Sorry I'm confused - are you saying your files in a directory or in a .iso file?
[04:11] <rikai> SeaD, in fact, from what i glanced at, it sounds almost exactly like what you want.
[04:12] <SeaD> penguin42, i've coppied the CD files on a HDD in C:\ubuntu\
[04:12] <iter> SeaD: http://wiki.africasource2.tacticaltech.org/post/main/02kq1ct2pXNBBsXY
[04:12] <Justy-> lupine_85, Thanks very much for your prompt help =)
[04:12] <SeaD> then i installed grub (DOS version)
[04:12] <SeaD> i boot in GRUB
[04:12] <lupine_85> np
[04:12] <SeaD> en now i want to start the CD setup from my HDD
[04:12] <mepa|Yancho> anyone can guide me in which folder this file is mbstring.so pls
[04:12] <SeaD> this is possible and i did.. but the setup asks for a CD later and that's the problem
[04:12] <SeaD> :)
[04:12] <penguin42> SeaD: Ah I don't think you can do that
[04:13] <SeaD> hmmm
[04:13] <SeaD> and can you boot an .iso file in GRUB?
[04:13] <rikai> SeaD, so you want to install ubuntu from the iso on your hard drive?
[04:13] <Paddy_EIRE> for some reason the "add/remove" option at the bottom of the "Applications" menu has disappeared, how can I get it back
[04:14] <Hotkey> HI Newbie here - got my cd - want to install on XP PC - will the install set up a dual boot for me?
[04:14] <rikai> SeaD, easy enough, it seems.
[04:14] <lupine_85> Hotkey: yep
[04:14] <SeaD> rikai, any way is accepted as long it works ;) So yes, if i can boot an ISO trough GRUB in dos it will solve my problem
[04:14] <rikai> SeaD, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=28948
[04:14] <iter> SeaD: you can definitely boot an iso from grub
[04:14] <lupine_85> If I were you though, I'd do the partitioning using partition magic
[04:15] <Justy-> Paddy_EIRE, Can you see Alarcate Menu Editor under Applications->Accessories ( sorry for the wrong translation if there is )
[04:15] <lupine_85> IME, dapper's ntfsresize chokes on the occasional partition and breaks it
[04:15] <lupine_85> no idea what edgy's is like, but better safe than sorry i suggest
[04:15] <Justy-> Paddy_EIRE, Alacarte*
[04:15] <Hotkey> lup - eek I dont want to break anything!?
[04:15] <Paddy_EIRE> justy the option for that add/remove to be visible aint there
[04:15] <SeaD> iter, also an iso that's on C:\ubuntu\ like C:\ubuntu\myubuntu.iso ???
[04:15] <lupine_85> :D
[04:15] <SeaD> is this supported in the GRUB (DOS version)?
[04:15] <rikai> SeaD, looks to be.
[04:16] <lupine_85> Just use partition magic or /something/ in Windows to resize your partition before the install
[04:16] <Hotkey> lup ok thx
[04:16] <lupine_85> then there'll be absolutely no chance (rather than a very small chance) of the installer breaking your XP partition
[04:16] <penguin42> rikai: Now you've made me curious - how does the booted Linux see the image?
[04:17] <Justy-> Paddy_EIRE, http://justyy.by.ru/EkranG%f6r%fcnt%fcs%fc-Alacarte%20Menu%20Editor.png here it is?
[04:17] <Paddy_EIRE> Justy-: any ideas

[04:20] <SeaD> rikai, hmmm... can you give me an url with an example that boots a iso from C:\ ??? trough the GRUB DOS version?
[04:20] <Ambimom> anyone using parallels?
[04:21] <penguin42> rikai: OK, I think from that thread it is actually doing a net install; it's just running the installer from the CD image
[04:21] <Justy-> Paddy_EIRE, Sorry then.. Actually I am a newbie at ubuntu.. sorry for my that silly behaviour
[04:21] <probose> how do i watch wmv files in ubuntu?

[04:22] <probose> Ambimom no, i just searched for "wmv" in synaptic manager but i dont found anything
[04:22] <penguin42> rikai: I'm not sure - it does mean he'll have to download everything rather than actually be as if he had just run the CD

[04:23] <SeaD> setting up a local mirror can do the work too :) Then I could use the netboot... and set as mirror my local mirror
[04:23] <rambo3> doccy, does it work anywhere else
[04:23] <Ambimom> probose: vlc should work but you should also load codecs
[04:24] <SeaD> but i don't know how to setup te mirror structure...

[04:27] <ubotu> hhmbuk_: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:27] <vidd> hhmbuk_, you should never use root for anything anyway
[04:27] <penguin42> Ambimom: I've used VMWare server for trying edgy - it's free, worth a try
[04:27] <rikai> rambo3, he's trying to install ubuntu without using a cd, i dont think he had another ubuntu install handy.
[04:27] <dv5237> is it possible to install ubuntu-server and then xorg+wm to minimize the installation?
[04:28] <penguin42> dv5237: Yes
[04:28] <mepa|Yancho> coNP i need it coz its giving an error on a premade script and in the help file it says i need to have that .so and that line in the ocnfig
[04:28] <zmm> my basic problem is 640X480 resolution. I want to run ubuntu on high res...so plz help me
[04:28] <jrib> !nvidia | zmm
[04:28] <ubotu> zmm: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:28] <Spee_Der> zmm:
[04:28] <Ambimom> penguin:  I have always done dual boot, but edgy ruined that! LOL
[04:28] <penguin42> dv5237: You can install each of the packages later - although some of them might pull loads of other stuff in
[04:28] <penguin42> Ambimom: Oops - have you bugreported that?
[04:28] <Spee_Der> zmm: In the xorg.conf, have you changed the default depth from 1 to say 16 or 24 ?
[04:29] <coNP> mepa|Yancho: then try it
[04:29] <aicila> I have a silly question: I connected to a windows machine to pull some files off of, and I put a folder to that share on my desktop. The problem is the damn thing won't go away! :P I can't seem to find a way to remove it, any ideas?
[04:29] <mepa|Yancho> coNP and how to reboot php pls ?
[04:29] <Ambimom> penguin:  do you find that VMWare runs ok or is it slow when both OS running?  and yes, I have reported edgy problems
[04:29] <mepa|Yancho> - /etc/init.d/apache restart <- like this ?
[04:30] <coNP> mepa|Yancho: yes, altough 'reload' might be enough
[04:30] <penguin42> Ambimom: If you have enough RAM it is ok; I found by setting the VMWare to allow it to swap all of its memory out then it didn't slow my host down; although I've only got 512MB
[04:30] <dv5237> penguin42: what do i need to install for xorg since there are load of xorg packages
[04:30] <zmm> yeah! i did change default depth to 16 yesterday...but to no effect
[04:30] <Spee_Der> Hmmm
[04:30] <mepa|Yancho> coNP : bash: /etc/init.d/apache: No such file or directory :(
[04:30] <vidd> aicila, remove the files from the folder so it is EMPTY
[04:30] <Mikel0> !acrobat
[04:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about acrobat - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:30] <aicila> ah but I can't do that vidd, these files are on another computer and need to stay there. I just need the folder off of my desktop
[04:30] <vidd> aicila, then you can deleye it with sudo
[04:30] <coNP> mepa|Yancho: maybe apache2?
[04:31] <Mikel0> !aread
[04:31] <mepa|Yancho> ow oops lol :)
[04:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about aread - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:31] <Ambimom> penguin:  I was thinking of 226 and 226...hmmm...so should set for 512?
[04:31] <Mikel0> !areader
[04:31] <SeaD> I've also installed the Ubuntu base system on my HDD trough VMware. Cus the VMware sees the HDD as an SCI device and not as a IDE it changes the boot settings... Now if I get the HDD back into the laptop and try to boot I get a kernel panic, because the root fs is set like: root=/dev/sda0. Is it possible to boot anyway by changing the root to something else like root=/dev/hda1 or something?
[04:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about areader - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:31] <penguin42> dv5237: There is a package called xserver-xorg  which I think might pull all the relavant ones in
[04:31] <dv5237> penguin42: thanks
[04:31] <penguin42> SeaD: Yeh should do - but I'm also fairly sure you can tell VMWare to present the disc as IDE
[04:32] <zmm> ubutu:why do i need to install ati/NVIDIA
[04:32] <SeaD> penguin42, nope, not possible...
[04:32] <SeaD> as far as i know
[04:32] <mepa|Yancho> coNP same error still
[04:32] <penguin42> Sead: I'm sure the vmware server I've got here lets you do IDE discs....
[04:33] <zmm> ubutu: will installing ati/nvidia solve the problem
[04:33] <SeaD> penguin42, i use the workstation version :)
[04:33] <SeaD> maybe the server can do the work
[04:33] <zmm> ubutu: if so how
[04:33] <jrib> zmm: do you have an nvidia/ati card?
[04:33] <penguin42> SeaD: Ah I've not tried Workstation in ages
[04:34] <SeaD> penguin42, but is it also possible to solve the problem in GRUB by changing the root params?
[04:34] <mepa|Yancho> coNP however now : Multibyte Support 	enabled - so it is enabled - then its a script problem :) so thanks alot for ur help
[04:34] <aicila> anyone know how to remove a shared windows folder that I can't seem to get off my desktop?
[04:34] <coNP> mepa|Yancho: you're welcome
[04:34] <penguin42> SeaD: Yeh you should just be able to change it to /dev/hda?  and with edgy because it uses UUIDs I don't even think you'll have to change your fstab
[04:34] <Spee_Der> aicila: Did you try right click on that ICON to see if the send to trash option would work ?
[04:35] <aicila> yup, it doesn;t
[04:35] <vidd> aicila, DID YOU NOT SEE WHAT I TOLD YOU>
[04:35] <Spee_Der> darn
[04:35] <SeaD> penguin42, so root=/dev/hda should do the work?
[04:35] <Spee_Der> Please don't yell, it hurts my eyes.
[04:35] <penguin42> SeaD: No, if it was sda1 then hda1 should do it
[04:35] <aicila> I did vidd, but this folder isn't actually on this system.  you can even look in /home/me/Desktop and the folders aren't there
[04:35] <vidd> aicila, you remove all files from the folder
[04:36] <zmm> jrib: I don't know. how can i know if i have nvidia/ati card or some else
[04:36] <penguin42> damn - my vmware server install won't actually start up on edgy
[04:36] <aicila> there has got to be a way to remove this share without having to remove all of the files on the remote computer
[04:36] <jrib> zmm: type 'lspci' in a terminal
[04:36] <vidd> then type sudo rmdir /home/me/Desktop/.[foldername] 
[04:36] <Linuxpoa> Hello peoples
[04:37] <SeaD> penguin42, i tried that too, (root=/dev/hda1) bot still kernel panic
[04:37] <ramvi> When installing amarok without kde installed, media devices doesn't work. What package am I missing?
[04:37] <penguin42> aicila: Are you trying to stop your machine sharing it or attempting to share off anther one?
[04:37] <iami89> hi there
[04:37] <vidd> aicila, remove the share properties from the other computer
[04:37] <penguin42> SeaD: Ah
[04:37] <aicila> penguin: stop it from sharing it
[04:37] <aicila> erm, I mean penguin42
[04:37] <penguin42> aicila: And it is sharing it to be visible to Windows (using Samba?)
[04:37] <Linuxpoa> My K6 with ubuntu-server reboot in the load ! One help ?
[04:37] <test88> if I masquerade anywhere to anywhere in postrouting should all internal traffice be able to go out to the internet?
[04:38] <dv5237> how can i get a list of all the installed packages? (preff. in the CLI)
[04:38] <aicila> it's a windows share that I accessed through Ubuntu, I didn't actually setup samba for it, so it's Windows -> Linux, not Linux -> Windows
[04:38] <penguin42> dv5237: dpkg -l
[04:38] <tristanmike> Hi, I'm having some major problems. When I log into my Ubuntu, after about 10-15 seconds, everything locks up. I don't have anything aside from the defaults under "Sessions" and I can't determine if something I've installed is causing this. I have my System Monitor app in the panel, and it doesn't record any strange cpu/ram/HD/etc. issues. Where can I start to look for the problem. Thanx for any assistance.
[04:38] <dv5237> penguin42: thats installed?!
[04:38] <vidd> aicila, but it IS linux to windows
[04:38] <penguin42> aicila: Ah, so you should be able to do on the LInux   umount /whereever/itwas/mounted
[04:38] <philip_> rpm -qa ;-) redhat days
[04:38] <vidd> aicila, you MUST turn off the share properties for the folder
[04:39] <beasty> lol philip_
[04:39] <aicila> ah unmount, that would be the command I'm looking for
[04:39] <penguin42> dv5237: dpkg -l | grep "^ii"    (I don't know if there is a neater way!)
[04:39] <penguin42> oh
[04:39] <tristanmike> aicila: it's "umount" not "unmount"
[04:39] <aicila> oops, thanks tristanmike!
[04:39] <SeaD> penguin42, suggestions??? A How-to on installing Ubuntu trough a ISO from local HDD (Partiotion 2 D:\) can help me too... ;)
[04:40] <tristanmike> aicila: I make the same typo all the time :P
[04:40] <aicila> any idea where that mount is? it's not a hidden directory in my desktop unfortunatly
[04:40] <Zer0Her0> hey is it possible to change the modifier keys around?
[04:40] <test88> aicila  "which mount"
[04:41] <aicila> perfect, thanks test88!
[04:41] <Kengur> hi, how do i install ubuntu with "noapic"? were does it belong in the init string?
[04:41] <sarixe> argh, i messed up this time.
[04:41] <penguin42> SeaD: I'm not sure to be honest - I'd start with the alternate CD, probably copy the contents out of the ISO onto your hard disc as a directory, use that GRUB trick to boot the installer and then point the installer to get it its files off the hard disc
[04:41] <sarixe> i changed the resolution and crashed X
[04:41] <Arron> how do i get bcm43xx_fwcutter instaled on a laptop, for wireless if i cant connect ubuntu to the web? and how do i blacklist the bcm43xx driver forit to work?
[04:42] <sarixe> and then when i went to login again, X crashed.
[04:42] <sarixe> kdm works
[04:42] <penguin42> Arron: Got a USB key fob?
[04:42] <sarixe> just not my user name.
[04:42] <sarixe> where's the config file, so i can fix this?
[04:42] <Arron> penguin42: yes, where can i download it from?
[04:42] <gu014> is there a GUi in ubuntu that lists all currently running apps?
[04:42] <penguin42> Arron: Ah that I don't know
[04:43] <sarixe> gu014: KSysGuard
[04:43] <sarixe> gu014: or, if you're in gnome, System Monitor
[04:43] <tristanmike> gu014: System-Administration-System Monitor
[04:43] <Arron> how do i "blacklist" a kernel module so it wont load?
[04:44] <sarixe> how do i edit my user's screen resolution config from a command line?
[04:44] <gu014> sarixe,tristanmike, thank you very much
[04:44] <penguin42> Arron: The nasty hack is just to rename the .ko file
[04:44] <svu_> where could I find f-spot 0.2.2 for edgy eft?
[04:44] <sarixe> gu014: np
[04:44] <SeaD> penguin42, that's exactly what i did, but the setup asks for a cd later. that's the problem. if there is a way to point a map on the HDD where i loaded the setup from as a CD-device then that will do the work, but i don't know if i can mount a HDD MAP as a CD device trough grub. or trough the ubuntu setup by using the console. suggestions?
[04:44] <Kengur> how do i pass "noapic" when installing?
[04:45] <Kengur> should i insert as it 1 parameter?
[04:45] <ronaldo> Kengur: in the grub menu you can choose to apend parameters
[04:45] <sarixe> how do i edit my user's screen resolution config from a command line?
[04:45] <penguin42> SeaD: Are you sure you are using the alternate CD (and told it to use the mounted hard disc?) - I'd hope it didn't try and get a CD - but if it does I'm not sure of a fix
[04:45] <melon> is it possible to have desktop icons "without" the name (text) under it - on the actual ubuntu desktop?
[04:45] <zmm> jrib: i'm seeing a list as a result of lspci but none of the entry is saying ati/nvidia
[04:45] <Kengur> ronaldo: i need to install from cd with that option
[04:46] <jrib> zmm: what does it say for vga compatible controller
[04:46] <dudanogueira> SeaD, did you see a documentation in the help.ubuntu.com? there you can find a lot of ways of installing ubuntu (netinstall, from hd, usbdisk...)
[04:46] <sarixe> how do i edit my user's screen resolution config from a command line?
[04:46] <penguin42> sarixe: Repeating the question this frequently really doesn't help
[04:46] <sarixe> sorry
[04:46] <overridex-laptop> tomboy doesn't show any systray icon for me, what's wrong?
=== ayaa is now known as loca|host
[04:46] <zmm> jrib: for VGA it says "0000:01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 5a61"
[04:46] <sarixe> is there any way?
[04:47] <SeaD> dudanogueira, yes i did... the netboot also but this asks for internet connection and i dont't have it on that network
[04:47] <jrib> zmm: well there you, go.  You have an ati :)
[04:47] <dudanogueira> sarixe, probably editing the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and restarting the x server...
[04:47] <sarixe> right
[04:47] <sarixe> i'll try that, brb
[04:47] <SeaD> penguin42, how to tell the setup to use the mounted HDD and not the CD-device?
[04:47] <penguin42> sarixe: Thing is if it is working for other users then it has to be something in your directory
[04:47] <zmm> jrib: yeah! but not nvidia:)
[04:47] <Kengur> man..
[04:47] <Arron> what kernel is the default for the stable ubuntu?
[04:48] <lupine_85> 2.6.17-10-generic
[04:48] <penguin42> Arron: 2.6.17-10
[04:48] <Arron> thanks
[04:48] <zmm> jrib: what should I do to enable higher resolution....whatever it may be
[04:48] <jrib> zmm: if you install the binary drivers from ati, your performance will probably be better.  If it's the case you don't have resolutions listed in system > prefs > screen resolution, you can try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and choose more resolutions
=== Linuturk_zZz is now known as Linuturk
[04:49] <sarixe> what would be in my user directory, penguin42?
[04:49] <Arron> penguin42: does that have -rc2 in it?
[04:49] <penguin42> Arron: No
[04:49] <penguin42> Arron: Or at least that is the Ubuntu package name for it
[04:49] <jrib> zmm: note that that last command wipes out your current config and overwrites it with the options you choose.  if you choose the wrong options, you may not have X.  It's not difficult, just letting you know.
[04:50] <penguin42> Arron: I think this is based off the 2.6.17 release - i.e. after rc2
[04:50] <Arron> penguin42: my wireless works in 2.6.17-rc2 or newer....
[04:50] <Arron> *supose to*
[04:50] <zmm> jrib: i try this ''sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' since I only have 640X480 res. listed in Sys->Pref->Scr Res
[04:50] <penguin42> Arron: Oh I think you've got a fair chance then
[04:50] <Arron> thanks
[04:51] <penguin42> Arron: Which is your wireless?
[04:51] <_raf> hi ,  when i use 'MC', the MC shell give me the 'MC cd command' in it history ! I dont want this, How to do ?

[04:51] <sidewalk`> how can i let normal users use the mount command?
[04:51] <Arron> its a compaq r4000, with a Broadcom Air Force One Rev. 02 Wireless Card integrated
[04:52] <sidewalk`> is it enough if i chmod /bin/mount ?
[04:52] <penguin42> Arron: OK, the changelog says 'Update to 2.6.17 final' - so yes it is newer than the rc
[04:52] <lupine_85> sidewalk`: add them to group 46
[04:52] <Arron> penguin:thanks :-)
[04:52] <lupine_85> IIRC
[04:52] <lupine_85> add add 'user' to the options in /etc/fstab
[04:53] <sidewalk`> lupine_85: which options?
[04:53] <lupine_85> the list of options for each mountpoint. usually starts with 'defaults' - man fstab for more details
[04:53] <mitch_> I can't for the life of me find a decent looking gtk theme.
[04:53] <sidewalk`> lupine_85: im trying to mount using captive-ntfs
[04:54] <sidewalk`> lupine_85: and i want the user to be able to read/write to the mounted partition
[04:54] <sidewalk`> chmoding and chgrping the mounted partition is not an option

[04:55] <ubotu> eegore: vnc is a way of doing remote desktop.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !freenx.
[04:55] <sidewalk`> h the title  "Configuring

[05:06] <sarixe> any help with reconfiguring the resolution for only my user?
[05:06] <Linuxpoa> ubuntu-server run in k6 processors ? Thanks !
[05:06] <sarixe> other users work fine.

[05:08] <ianmacgregor> jdroid-: Yeah, you could be right about gpgme, seahorse does install it, but I like seahorse for it's nice front-end.
[05:08] <sarixe> well i don't have access to anything that looks remotely like a start menu.

[05:12] <dtek> I have a 40GB HD with 2 Primary Partitions on it, the second one (hda2) has the Ubuntu Logical Partitions, one for home, one for root and one for boot
[05:12] <samu2> How can I take a screenshot of my gnome desktop?
[05:13] <jrib> Zambezi: checkinstall is best (see the bot's link), but you would probably need sudo to install ouside your home directory.  by the way, when you put "Compile:" like that it seems like you are talking to someone named "Compile".  :)
[05:13] <jrib> !checkinstall | Zambezi
[05:13] <ubotu> Zambezi: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall  -  Please: Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page. - DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!

[05:41] <iami89> that still not enough for me
[05:41] <variant> Languid: does the corruption happen a lot or just once?
[05:41] <mc44> MeanGuy: well I think about 80% of those reboots could be avoided, but you cant control advice people give :)
[05:41] <Languid> variant, it's happened twice now
[05:41] <zmm> jrib: what resolutions should i select....
[05:42] <lupine_85> lordmetroid: there is a GUI config utility if you want...
[05:42] <Languid> variant, spaced out over about 2 weeks
[05:42] <variant> Languid: the / partition?
[05:42] <lupine_85> it's called rutilt
[05:42] <lupine_85> !rutilt
[05:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rutilt - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:42] <scamboy> dj: have u tried wine??
[05:42] <Languid> variant, yup
[05:42] <zmm> jrib: as in standards
[05:42] <argos> where is some database of deb  packages? (some link please) - i cant compile tar, because it is too hard for me, now... :-(
[05:42] <DJAdmiral> scamboy: Tried WINE with what?
[05:42] <lupine_85> bah, it's still not in the repos. are you using i386 edgy?
[05:42] <MeanGuy> mc44,  well, yeah, atleast they're trying to help, but weird that no one "pointed out" that u dont need to reboot, anyways no harm done :D
[05:42] <wozcu> i just dld ubuntu to replace my sucky windoz, and asking how to turn off x to install drivers??
[05:42] <Languid> sorry guys, i gotta go
[05:42] <cong0_natty> :is still rockin dapper
[05:42] <Spee_Der> iami89: It's happypenguin.org
[05:42] <lupine_85> DJAdmiral: there's a command called "readpst" that will do what you want
[05:42] <mc44> MeanGuy: and I have no clue why they are getting you to compile fglrx when the correct version is in the repos... but anyway
[05:42] <MeanGuy> mc44,  u know anything about tv-out with extended desktop? im only getting cloned ones
[05:42] <iami89> oh, i almost forget, how to install wine?
[05:42] <gigiven> IO
[05:43] <DJAdmiral> lupine_85: Already tried that, but it doesn't work with Outlook 2003.
[05:43] <iami89> i've tried follow guide but that not work
[05:43] <Spee_Der> iami89: sudo apt-get install wime
[05:43] <scamboy> !wine
[05:43] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[05:43] <xuser> Anyone notice rdesktop acting slow in edgy?
[05:43] <lordmetroid> lupine_85: I tried to configure thru "Networking" however nothing sticks
[05:43] <mc44> MeanGuy: never used it, sorry
[05:43] <lupine_85> thunderbird might be your vest bet then
[05:43] <MeanGuy> mc44,  beats ME! :( thats the most annoying thing, why do u need to get it from somewhere else when its already there
[05:43] <lordmetroid> rutilt he
[05:43] <lupine_85> lordmetroid: yes, that's to be expected
[05:43] <DJAdmiral> iami89: Go to Applications-> Add/Remove -> Find WINE there -> install
[05:43] <jrib> zmm: do you have an lcd?
[05:43] <lupine_85> if you don't want rutilt you could edit /etc/network/interfaces directly
[05:43] <MeanGuy> mc44,  no worries :) i'll keep on searching. thanx man. how long u've been using ubuntu?
[05:43] <zmm> jrib: no
[05:43] <mc_> ricanelite: i cant send private messages,nothing exiting here,whats up with you?
[05:44] <mc44> MeanGuy: ~ 6 months
[05:44] <MeanGuy> lol, u're old :P
[05:44] <jrib> zmm: then just select the ones you want to use 1280x960 and 1024x768 are probably good
[05:44] <MeanGuy> lol, he's dead
[05:44] <wozcu> cya gonna eat

[05:45] <MeanGuy> <mc44> MeanGuy: ~ 6 months
[05:45] <MeanGuy> <MeanGuy> lol, u're old :P
[05:45] <MeanGuy> * mc44 has quit (Remote closed the connection)
[05:45] <mc44> MeanGuy: no long enough to stop myself crashing unstable shiny xgl
[05:45] <lupine_85> iami89: they're usually included in the kernel and get loaded automagically
[05:46] <lupine_85> if not, then chances are the modem isn't supported (i.e. it's probably a winmodem)
[05:46] <ricanelite> nothing much, do you use Apollon? Or do you know how to get mp4 videos playing on Edgy
[05:46] <iami89> but it cant connect to internet
[05:46] <argos> bye
[05:46] <MeanGuy> mc44,  better than me :) 1st day :) personally i haven't used linux since i got married. wife get jealous from computers :)
[05:46] <ricanelite> because when i had dapper i could play videos i downloaded from the internet to work
[05:46] <sCsI> iami89 what type of modem?
[05:46] <iami89> wait
[05:46] <weardlan> is an imaginary one
[05:47] <mc44> MeanGuy: well you know, linux is a lot more stable than a woman. Ahem.
[05:47] <weardlan> can't connect to internet, but *can* chat on IRC
[05:47] <MeanGuy> ok , now i need to change the resolution :)
[05:47] <MeanGuy> mc44,  looool.
[05:47] <weardlan> 's a special modem
[05:47] <Zer0Her0> what packages do i need to install to get the kernel headers?
[05:47] <cong0_natty> weardlan, try disabling the connection closing the network connections
[05:47] <iami89> HSP56micromodem
[05:47] <lordmetroid> bbl restart

[05:52] <variant> cong0_natty: funnily enough, the games that are ported nativly to linux work better  :)
[05:52] <Asc> mtymobile: Did you do any configuring of said kernel?
[05:52] <lupine_85> sampo_v2: specify wireless-ap in /etc/network/interfaces
[05:52] <rikai> cong0_natty, whats wrong with linux gaming? its worked out rather well for me.
[05:52] <cong0_natty> variant, tell me that when ut2004 runs smooth on my laptop under linux.
[05:52] <cong0_natty> or quake 3
[05:52] <variant> cong0_natty: it runs very smooth on my laptop under gnu/linux
[05:52] <UltraGuy8> I am trying to install Ubuntu on my laptop... how long am I supposed to see a black screen with a blinking cursor?
[05:52] <roycebarber> ut runs smooth on anythiung
[05:52] <cong0_natty> both run like shit with my ati chipset
[05:52] <iami89> where to download quake3?
[05:53] <cong0_natty> variant, i've set both up nurmous times on many different distros
[05:53] <variant> cong0_natty: ah, so the problem is your poor choice of graphics card..
[05:53] <DJAdmiral> iami89: You can't "download" the full version of quake3.
[05:53] <cong0_natty> variant, no comparison to xp gaming
[05:53] <roycebarber> I wish i could get guildwars, eve online working in linux, and secondlife even though they have a linux client but its buggy
[05:53] <auke> Howdy. anyone experienced with Xgl? I'm running into troubles after following the howto
[05:53] <cong0_natty> not that i support microhell

[05:56] <jatt> UUID=19b1e59e-e0ad-4755-9936-2facf90cda99 / ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1
[05:56] <MeanGuy> cong0_natty,  lol, u're really mean :P
[05:56] <cong0_natty> im orry
[05:56] <jatt> what is all this UUID.... stuff?
[05:56] <cong0_natty> i know i am mean im tryin to be nice :D
[05:57] <cong0_natty> sorry :(
[05:57] <UltraGuy8> can anyone tell me what the error means?
[05:57] <cong0_natty> yahoo did it to me :(
[05:57] <zm1> jrib: no.... and not even how to restart X
[05:57] <MeanGuy> lol
[05:57] <whaley> when I run the ps command, how should the columns VSZ and RSS be interpreted?  As I understand it, RSS is the current amount of physical memory that a process is taking up and RSS is the total amount of memory a process is taking up (swap + physical).  Is this correct?
[05:57] <mc__|umbauen> UltraGuy8: did not get your error
[05:57] <Asc> mtymobile: In that case, nope, I've got no idea.  They work for me just fine after recompiling.
[05:57] <UltraGuy8> I just got: 17180186.140000 Byffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 357464
[05:57] <whaley> erm, the second RSS should be VSZ
[05:57] <UltraGuy8> uh byffer = buffer
[05:57] <mc__|umbauen> UltraGuy8: maybe the cd is fucked up
[05:57] <weardlan> dodgy CD
[05:57] <UltraGuy8> damn it
[05:57] <mtymobile> Asc: could it be suspend2 userui?
[05:57] <rikai> jatt, honestly, i have no clue, but i uncommented the line and removed the uuid, because edgy started complaining about stuff not being mounted. :D
[05:57] <MeanGuy> UltraGuy8,  seems like either ur copy, or ur drive is fucked up
[05:58] <scamboy> !language
[05:58] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[05:58] <UltraGuy8> It has to be my drive
[05:58] <Rockj> jatt: "new" way of identifying your harddrives. so if change on-board slot on where you connect your harddrive, you dont need to remmap it to correct /dev/hdb1
[05:58] <UltraGuy8> sorry
[05:58] <cong0_natty> hey any of you guys or girls had a problem with the shut down menu borking in 6.06 when you do updates?
[05:58] <DJAdmiral> mc__|umbauen: Mind your language.
[05:58] <Asc> mtymobile: Unknown, I have no expereince with that.
[05:58] <cong0_natty> its happend to me like 4 or 5 times now
[05:58] <UltraGuy8> I apologize
[05:58] <MeanGuy> UltraGuy8,  no need to be sorry :)
[05:58] <UltraGuy8> it has to be my drive
[05:58] <MeanGuy> cong0_natty,  not me ;l
[05:58] <UltraGuy8> I tried like 5 copies of Mandriva before this
[05:58] <mc__|umbauen> DJAdmiral: you take the ubotu too serious..
[05:58] <jrib> zm1: ok to restore the backup you would execute this command: 'sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.20061105214852 /etc/X11/xorg.conf' .  You can press ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a tty (terminal), login and executet hat if you need to.  To return to X you would do ctrl-alt-f7.  Now, to restart X, you can log out of gnome and press ctrl-alt-backspace
[05:58] <MeanGuy> UltraGuy8,  same problem?
[05:58] <mc__|umbauen> UltraGuy8: than it is your cd-drive
[05:58] <UltraGuy8> I assume so
[05:58] <Rockj> jatt: think it generates a ID out of the harddrives serialnumber and some info, so it should be unique for your harddrive. so you can use ideport1 or 2 or same..it will still regonize it back.
[05:59] <MeanGuy> yep :)
[05:59] <cong0_natty> weird.
[05:59] <UltraGuy8> I am a total noob
[05:59] <DJAdmiral> mc__|umbauen: "Profanity is the strongest expression of a weak mind"
[05:59] <UltraGuy8> but I have burned like 10 cds
[05:59] <KradarK> en repositury is up??????
[05:59] <ryanakca>  is it possible to make your current gpg key bigger? like converting a 2048 to a 4096 one?
[05:59] <UltraGuy8> I have a USB drive, would it be possible to install it from there and get around this problem?
[05:59] <KradarK> italian repository is down..
[05:59] <MeanGuy> UltraGuy8,  sometimes changing the cd brand helps :)
[05:59] <jatt> rikai, Rockj I see thanks for the explanation. Fortunately in my case those partition still get mounted.
[05:59] <mc__|umbauen> DJAdmiral: i love you too
[05:59] <wrichards> hey

[05:59] <MeanGuy> some of those empty cds are really crappy

[06:01] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  ahh... breezy is what? 5.10?
[06:01] <jrib> jenda: you have to tell it to use bash instead of sh (which now points to dash)
[06:01] <MeanGuy> cuz im new to ubuntu
[06:01] <mc__|umbauen> jenda: open /usr/bin/frostiwre and replace sh with bash
[06:01] <scamboy> !alsa|linuxvampire

[06:01] <DJAdmiral> ompaul: I know.
[06:02] <lupine_85> funny, I changed it so sh pointed to bash :p
[06:02] <scamboy> linuxvampire: oppsss////..
[06:02] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  well, i had problems with 5.10 , was never able to boot into X with my laptop
[06:02] <linuxvampire> Also, if you'll notice I said I tried 5 tutorials on ubuntuforums. it was classified 'as a bug' which hasn't been fixed....
[06:02] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  so i downloaded edgy, works perfectly fine
[06:02] <DJAdmiral> ompaul, mc__|umbauen: I'm not pursuing this thing any further. I have a headache as it is.

[06:02] <scamboy> meanguy: live cd??
[06:02] <Rockj> jatt: arn't those partitions supposed to be mounted? o_O   (dunno your problem, just explained UUID thingie)

[06:03] <linuxvampire> this isn't "user error" this is an ubuntu bug.
[06:03] <scamboy> linuxvampire: sense cannot be made..hehehe can't help u...
[06:03] <DJAdmiral> Alright - here's the thing, how do I convert an Outlook 2003 PST file to MBOX if I don't have access to a Windows machine?
[06:03] <DJAdmiral> iami89: You cannot get the full version of Quake 3 for free.
[06:03] <jrib> ryanakca: yes if the nsa can only crack your cd after one year and you fear that they may be devoting most of their resources to breaking your key :)
[06:03] <ompaul> DJAdmiral, I believe that thunderbird can do that
[06:03] <iami89> have you got a full?
[06:03] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  yeah. see? i read before downloading the cd. why not download the newest release instead of downloading old release and upgrading it.
[06:03] <DJAdmiral> iami89: You can download the Linux executables to play it, however you need the Quake 3 CD.
[06:03] <jrib> ryanakca: s/cd/key
[06:04] <milionar> iani89 shop?
[06:04] <linuxvampire> I guess no one knows anything about thinkpad 600's and ubuntu then.
[06:04] <ompaul> DJAdmiral, possibly evolution also
[06:04] <jrib> zm1: yes
[06:04] <DJAdmiral> iami89: Go shop for it. This is not a place to discuss illegal things.
[06:04] <ryanakca> jrib: decides to be paranoid and decides to generate a new key
[06:04] <Elly> anyone? can you do a server install from the livecd?
[06:04] <Rockj> DJAdmiral: if your mail is imap, you could use fetchmail to transfer your emails.
[06:04] <DJAdmiral> ompaul: Evolution cannot convert PST to MBOX.
[06:04] <mc44> omkar86: so the correct files get installed on upgrade
[06:04] <DJAdmiral> Rockj: No IMAP.
[06:04] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  my point. i had problems with 5.10 on my laptop, so i didn't bother myself with it.
[06:04] <scamboy> meanguy: i dont hav fast internet...the internet in my country s**** u see,,
[06:04] <salim> isnt vmware (workstation?) free?
[06:05] <mc__|umbauen> DJAdmiral: no information is not legal
[06:05] <weardlan> DJA as it's Ol2003 likely your best bet is to get it to w windows box and up to an imap server
[06:05] <ryanakca> jrib: there might be a few embarrassing things on my computer that I don't know of... don't want the goverment to get at them :D
[06:05] <ryanakca> lol
[06:05] <DJAdmiral> salim: Workstation is free, but you have to download it from the vmware site
[06:05] <omkar86> SO IF I WANT 6.10kde I MUST HAVE 6.06KDE VERSION?
[06:05] <weardlan> i don't think there's a native linux tool ATM
[06:05] <jrib> ryanakca: hehe
[06:05] <iami89> sorry
[06:05] <scamboy> meanguy: anyway i will wait for dapper coz i not confidenton edgy..
[06:05] <jrib> !caps | omkar86
[06:05] <Rockj> DJAdmiral: if you got access to GUI, you could try Thunderbird. I think it supports import of Ms Outlook mail.. or maybe thats only in windows :/
[06:05] <ubotu> omkar86: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[06:05] <DJAdmiral> mc__|umbauen: There are some things some people should not know.
[06:05] <iami89> i'll save my money
[06:05] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  :) u'll manage, been there too :) i heard drapper or 6.06 works fine too.
[06:05] <iami89> sad
[06:05] <mc44> omkar86: what version are you currently running?
[06:05] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  good luck, dont worry, alot of my friends say that its working fine :D
[06:05] <salim> but I have to register to download, isnt it?
[06:05] <DJAdmiral> Rockj: I'd do that, but as I said, I have no access to a windows machine.
[06:05] <omkar86> 6.06
[06:05] <mc__|umbauen> DJAdmiral:that is your opinion.
[06:06] <mc44> omkar86: kubuntu or ubuntu?
[06:06] <omkar86> ubuntu
[06:06] <MeanGuy> any of u guys using remote access program ?
[06:06] <mc44> omkar86: and you want to upgrade to Kubuntu?
[06:06] <omkar86> i want kubuntu 6.10
[06:06] <omkar86> yes
[06:06] <jatt> Rockj: I was reading the fstab man page and I don't understand how you can recover the UUIDs in case they get lost. Now ubuntu includes a commentary, where one can tell /dev/hda1 was converter to UUID=...
[06:06] <scamboy> meanguy: thanks/....
[06:06] <DJAdmiral> mc__|umbauen: And we are all entitled to it. But this channel does not permit the discussion of where to find illegal software.
[06:06] <weardlan> and CLI over ssh
[06:06] <jatt> s/converter/converted
[06:06] <iami89> have you try Alien Arena 2006 yet?
[06:06] <mc44> omkar86: well upgrade ubuntu to 6.10, then install kubuntu-desktop

[06:08] <MeanGuy> no idea ;l
[06:08] <DJAdmiral> How does one convert an Outlook 2003 PST to MBOX when one does not have access to a windows machine?
[06:08] <snoogans> have to say very impressed with ubuntu - printer was a gift from father-in-law not my choice of driver
[06:08] <Elly> mc__|umbauen: can you do a server install from a regular livecd?

[06:10] <hornet123> i try to add the gpg key of Ubuntu PLF, but the command never finishes: wget http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/12B83718.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[06:10] <Spee_Der> Thanks, will check it out.
[06:10] <UltraGuy8> now how do I make it bootable?
[06:10] <UltraGuy8> it is mounted to G:
[06:11] <variant> hornet123: plf doesnt exist any more
[06:11] <ryanakca> jrib: what do I do about my encrypted / signed files?
[06:11] <mc44> hornet123: you should be able to get packages without the gpg key, you will just get a warning that they are not authenticated
[06:11] <fishsticks> im an amarok user on gnome, so how do i stop rhythmbox from opening when i plug in my ipod?
[06:11] <poningru> UltraGuy8: did you see the guide?
[06:11] <jatt> fishsticks: uninstall rhythmbox?
[06:11] <snoogans> fishsticks: there is an option
[06:11] <jatt> he
[06:11] <poningru> UltraGuy8: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
[06:12] <sethk> fishsticks, there is a configuration in gnome for setting file types and handler applications
[06:12] <jrib> ryanakca: I don't know.  It may just be a hassle to decrypt and encrypt again and sign again everything.  Try #gpg or #gnupg (can't remember)
[06:12] <fishsticks> if i uninstall rhythmbox, it breaks ubuntu-desktop
[06:12] <fishsticks> sethk, is it in gconf
[06:12] <hikenboot> anyone know how to install the prodvd package?
[06:12] <hikenboot> it aint a package it appears
[06:12] <snoogans> removable devices in system preferences
[06:12] <poningru> fishsticks: go into rhythmbox
[06:12] <sethk> fishsticks, I'm not sure where it is, I used KDE, but you can find it on the menus
[06:13] <fishsticks> i found it
[06:13] <UltraGuy8> I get this error:
[06:13] <snoogans> fishsticks: try the removable devices in system preferences then choose the multimedia tab
[06:13] <poningru> cool
[06:13] <fishsticks> thanks snoogans
[06:13] <fishsticks> and everyone else =)
[06:13] <UltraGuy8> 'SYSLINUX' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
[06:13] <UltraGuy8> operable program or batch file.
[06:13] <gnomefreak> fishsticks: rhythmbox shouldnt break ubuntu-desktop it should however remove it
[06:13] <snoogans> fishsticks: I'm using XMMS cos it's like winamp
[06:13] <snoogans> I tried to remove it and it wouldn't let me
[06:13] <sethk> UltraGuy8, first of all, syslinux, not SYSLINUX.  second of all, it's a package, not a program named syslinux
[06:13] <snoogans> "other apps depend on it"
[06:14] <kmag> Anyone else have the Edgy install CD freeze on the boot screen?
[06:14] <fishsticks> im with snoogans, gnomefreak
[06:14] <snoogans> fishsticks: np glad to help (and I'm a noob too)
[06:14] <jatt> uninstall ubuntu-desktop isn't recommended, but I haven't had any problems uninstalling it when I want to get rid of software I don't need (e.g. evolution).
[06:14] <snoogans> pffft evolution
[06:14] <gnomefreak> jatt: its fine to remove

[06:15] <gnomefreak> jatt: just make sure you reinstall it before upgrading to a new version of ubuntu
[06:15] <kmag> (AMD64,  Asus A8N-E, 2 GB RAM, Matrox Millenium II )
[06:15] <jenda> jrib: thx - but now FW starts, and the window is just blank.
[06:15] <UltraGuy8> okay I'm sorry, like I said I am highly ignorant, but all I did was type in what was laid out in the guide that was given to me
[06:15] <kmag> yea... the video card is almost  a decade older than the other components
[06:15] <ryanakca> jrib: kk, #gnupg is dormant... :D
[06:15] <jrib> jenda: weird someone had that same problem earlier... I don't know what does that.  Do you have fancy transparency affects going on?
[06:15] <Rockj> DJAdmiral: maybe this might help you? I assume it work as well on linux as on a mac since its suggest use of Mozilla.  http://www.riches.com.au/articles/export-outlook-entourage.htm
[06:15] <sethk> UltraGuy8, guide must have been written by a windows user. :)
[06:16] <MarsRouter> hi all
[06:16] <jrib> effects even
[06:16] <Arepie> !p2p
[06:16] <ubotu> Conventional P2P clients: Limewire/GTK-Gnutella/Frostwire (Gnutella Network).  -  BitTorrent: see !torrent  -  Direct connect: try valknut.  -  Also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/P2PFileSharing for general information.
[06:16] <snoogans> anyone know about canon printer drivers?
[06:16] <jenda> jrib: shhhh! don't tell anyone... yes I do. I guess that's the answer...
[06:16] <UltraGuy8> so how do I use the syslinux package to make the drive bootable?
[06:16] <shintonduchi> MarsRouter: why Anvil kick you on fedora channel ?
[06:16] <thcrw8383> anyone know of a good flash video player for Ubuntu (6,10)
[06:16] <MarsRouter> i asked a lin etwice
[06:17] <snoogans> UltraGuy8: do you have a cd burner?
[06:17] <MarsRouter> after waitng 15 mins
[06:17] <jrib> jenda: try using a theme like clearlooks.  Does that do anything?
[06:17] <shintonduchi> Mars: so what's seem to be the problem?
[06:17] <jenda> jrib: hmm, I'll try.
[06:17] <MarsRouter> but u know such attitude lost a fedora user
[06:17] <sethk> UltraGuy8, you don't, that's not what it's for
[06:17] <MarsRouter> man im stuced in FC5
[06:17] <webben> thcrw8383, how about Flash player itself?
[06:17] <sethk> UltraGuy8, syslinux is used to make bootable floppies.  isolinux is used to make bootable CDs
[06:18] <shintonduchi> MarsRouter: could you be more specific what's seems to be your problem. i might help you
[06:18] <sethk> UltraGuy8, some very old docs use syslinux with CDs, but they were written before the syslinux developer added isolinux
[06:18] <sethk> UltraGuy8, what are you trying to do?
[06:18] <gnomefreak> MarsRouter: and shintonduchi please take that topic to #ubuntu-offtopic
[06:18] <webben> thcrw8383, http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html

[06:18] <Arepie> what is the best "p2p" program herE?
[06:18] <TinnedTuna> Arepie: BitTorrent
[06:18] <TinnedTuna> Do not download illegal crap
[06:18] <shintonduchi> Mars: Add/Remove on GUI stop working ?
[06:18] <snoogans> is micro torrent (utorrent) available?
[06:18] <MarsRouter> yeh
[06:19] <TinnedTuna> snoogans: only through Wine
[06:19] <thcrw8383> I mean to play FLV files
[06:19] <shintonduchi> Mars: if that break your fedora experience maybe you can rpm -e package_name on the console?
[06:19] <neosa-chris> install ktorrent
[06:19] <neosa-chris> it works fine
[06:19] <snoogans> </noobmode>Wine
[06:19] <snoogans> ?
[06:19] <MarsRouter> shintonduchi::> i just reinstalled system twice bcz it was only 1st day of FC5 on my mcahine
[06:19] <jatt> hmmm I had the flashplugin-nonfree installed and after the breezy->edgy upgrade, the sound of youtube videos 'jumps' all the time...
[06:19] <sethk> MarsRouter, are you going to install it four times on the second day?
[06:20] <MarsRouter> sethk::> nopes
[06:20] <TehUni> i used mdadm to create a raid1 array and it worked perfectly. then i rebooted and the set is gone! i've tried remounting it but it said md0 doesn't exist. how can i make it persist through reboots? (not my boot drive, btw)
[06:20] <shintonduchi> sorry
[06:20] <neosa-chris> jatt: i have no idea what you can do
[06:20] <gnomefreak> MarsRouter: we do not support fedora in here
[06:20] <sethk> MarsRouter, ok, just checking. :)
[06:20] <MarsRouter> i'll go back to ubuntu
[06:20] <snoogans> sethk: and on the first day there was 2 installs
[06:20] <jatt> I've heard there are issues for this plugin on amd64 even when running inside a 32bit chroot
[06:20] <sethk> MarsRouter, there is a #fedora channel, but it is populated by mutants, unfortunately.
[06:20] <sethk> MarsRouter, fedora itself is mostly ok, but #fedora is a serious problem.
[06:20] <jbroome> that's what yum does to you
[06:21] <snoogans> thanks for your time guys and girls, over and out
[06:22] <ianmacgregor> Ok, I just bought a Nokia E62 mobile phone. Is there any chance that I can get it connected to my Ubuntu desktop? Never had a mobile phone before.

[06:23] <Syirrus> What is a good quality sound card I could purchase for Ubuntu?
[06:23] <weardlan> otherwise no dice
[06:23] <gnomefreak> zovirl: i think they need to match versions
[06:24] <ianmacgregor> weardlan: Really? Well, it's not that important.. if I can't do it in Ubuntu without buying something extra, I"ll just do without.
[06:24] <zovirl> gnomefreak: that's what it seems like.  That's unfortunate, I'd really like to have both versions installed side-by-side

[06:34] <predius_> Curtman: try running "dhclient -i $devicename" once on the client machine once.
[06:34] <iter> Curtman: can you do system - administration - networking in gnome
[06:34] <Curtman> iter: The box in question isn't running Gnome.
[06:34] <predius_> BryanJK: can you run lspci and give me the line for the card?

[06:35] <riddlebox> can I downgrade my kernel to like 2.6.15?
[06:35] <BryanJK> It may take a minute... since the machine isnt on, brb
[06:35] <predius_> Curtman: try running dhclient, it should create it for you.
[06:35] <greenman> I'm getting this error on a directory that is chmodded to 777, any clues?
[06:35] <greenman> Cannot write to directory /var/www/myserver/htdocs/serendipity/templates_c. Please check the permissions.
[06:35] <predius_> riddlebox: it should be installed, if you upgraded.
[06:35] <Curtman> predius_: my dhclient has no '-i' arg..  It says "Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client V3.0.4"
[06:35] <predius_> greenman: ownership?
[06:36] <greenman> predius_: it's owned by www-data
[06:36] <riddlebox> predius, I installed edgy, but the kernel and nvidia drivers lock my system up, I need an older kernel
[06:36] <ianmacgregor> predius_: Would ownership really matter if the dir is drwxrwxrwx ?
[06:36] <predius_> Curtman: sorry, without the -i
[06:36] <predius_> ianmacgregor: I've had apache doing that sometimes.
[06:36] <greenman> ianmacgregor: that's what i was thinking
[06:36] <ianmacgregor> predius_: Oh, apache, ok
[06:36] <cocos> hi im trying to install xorg on the ubuntu-server but i get the following error when i try to run xorg 'no valid FontPath could be found'

[06:37] <iter> cocos: apt-get install xfonts-75dpi
[06:37] <greenman> okay, :) but i still have the owner right
[06:37] <greenman> i went and checked and apache processes are started by www-data
[06:38] <paitart> predius_,  i installed 5.10. its the CD a friend gave me.
[06:38] <ianmacgregor> greenman: Yeah, that will be the owner of most stuff in the site
[06:38] <greenman> so if www-data owns the directory and it's 777 I don't see what the problem is...
[06:38] <qwe123> if i listen to something on youtube, i cant listen a music... if i listen a music, i cant listen youtube. what should i do?
[06:38] <bonzai10> qwel123 i have similar problem
[06:38] <qwe123> and i can listen 2 musics playing on different players at the same time
[06:38] <predius_> qwe123: using dapper or edgy?
[06:38] <qwe123> dapper
[06:39] <bonzai10> then i use konqueror and everything is OK
[06:39] <predius_> hm.
[06:39] <Curtman> predius_: Well I pulled a new lease with dhclient and it didn't create that file..
[06:39] <predius_> Curtman: strange.
[06:40] <predius_> Curtman: $ locate dhclient-script?
[06:40] <greenman> i found it.  It's a directory left over from gentoo.  it's not there so it can't find it .  it can't find it, it can't write to it.
[06:40] <rizla> hi
[06:40] <Curtman> predius_: Hmmm.. I have /sbin/dhclient-script and /lib/dhcp3-client/call-dhclient-script
[06:41] <cocos> can i let xorg make its own xorg.conf?
[06:41] <qwe123> linux is cool but it gives me too much little problems... i even like this because i learn but many people would like this
[06:41] <rizla> is there a gui tool to reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[06:41] <predius_> Curtman: do what I told you on the /sbin one.
[06:41] <qwe123> wouldnt*
[06:41] <predius_> Curtman: or better yet.
[06:41] <predius_> Curtman: copy it to the folder in /etc/ and change it from there.
[06:41] <sorush20> hi what files do I need to install to be able to have open gl?
[06:42] <sorush20> I keep getting the mesa message..
[06:42] <Curtman> predius_: Shouldn't there be something I can add to /etc/networks/interfaces to tell it not to update?  This seems like it might be the hard way.  ;)

[07:04] <Sp4rKy> does anyone know how Ubuntu Live get the "language" and "keymap" option value from boot
[07:04] <Sp4rKy> ?
[07:04] <bruenig> lnx^, I am using edgy so this may not be true for you, but my /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2 is a symbolic link to libcairo.so.2.9.2
[07:04] <ixian_> dabaR_, no not really :p
[07:04] <dabaR_> ixian_: same here
[07:05] <LionsPhil> How can I discourage orinoco* from loading?
[07:05] <zspada15> ubuntu edgy x server failed to detect a screen, how do i fix that command line?
[07:05] <LionsPhil> They're getting in the way of hostap_pci, which are the correct modules for my card.
[07:05] <epresly> I cant see the partitions from the livecd gparted but I can mount the partitions from "disks". Now I cannot boot nor install ubuntu
[07:05] <lnx^> bruenig: yes, that is right. but i would need that file from _dapper_
[07:05] <greenman> nevermind i solved it
[07:05] <Zambezi> dabaR_, It's not me. I'm asking for another guy.
[07:05] <bruenig> lnx^, you would need to libcairo.so.2.9.2?
[07:05] <LionsPhil> Had this working under Gentoo, but Gentoo finally drove me mad. Hence getting it working all over again in Ubuntu...
[07:05] <paitart_> lupine_85, i'll come back later... will tweak around
[07:05] <lnx^> bruenig: i'd need the old version of libcairo.so
[07:05] <zspada15> Gentoo drove me crazy
[07:05] <lnx^> bruenig: the one used in dapper
[07:06] <paitart_> lupine_85, thank you very much for the help and advice
[07:06] <zspada15> i really wish i knew why its not finding a screen and how to fix it
[07:06] <dabaR_> Zambezi: well, the best I can tell you is to run man -k keyboard and see what different manuals are available for something like you want done
[07:06] <greenman> hmm...  I'm getting this:
[07:06] <greenman> Fatal error: Call to undefined function curl_init()
[07:06] <greenman> I installed php5-curl
[07:06] <lupine_85> np
[07:06] <bruenig> ok well, you may want to ask for libcairo.so.2.9.2 in your quest for the old one because the file you are requesting is just a symbolic link
[07:06] <lupine_85> lnx^: you wouldn't want to mix dapper and edgy libraries
[07:06] <MeanGuy> hmmm... how do i enable additional repositories?
[07:06] <lupine_85> different libc versions
[07:07] <lnx^> lupine_85: i'm forced to use dapper's openoffice since the fonts are broken in edgy
[07:07] <Zambezi> dabaR_, I'll tell him. Thanks.
[07:07] <epresly> how can I restore grub from being ruined by winxp ?
[07:07] <greenman> Fatal error: Call to undefined function curl_init()
[07:07] <dabaR_> LionsPhil: you can perhaps look into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[07:07] <dabaR_> !grub
[07:07] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[07:07] <lnx^> lupine_85: everything works fine, but when i try control+o, the program crashes due to the new version of libcairo
[07:07] <LionsPhil> dabaR_: Ta
[07:07] <bruenig> MeanGuy, copy and paste the following command, sudo vim -c "%s/# deb/deb/g" -c "wq" /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update
[07:07] <haffe> Hello. I'm trying to set up a wiki on my local network. My first try was with tiddlywiki, but that didn't work too well (konqueror unsupported). I'm now looking for alternatives. Could you recommend a wiki engine? My needs 1. Anonymous editing of pages 2. Support for uploaded images 3. Ease of installation.
[07:07] <greenman> how do i fix this?  I installed php5-curl
[07:07] <lupine_85> the fonts aren't broken in edgy, I think
[07:08] <kitche> !grub > epresly
[07:08] <greenman> haffe: twiki
[07:08] <MeanGuy> bruenig,  thanx :)
[07:08] <Sp4rKy> because i  develop an ubuntu based distro , and the live CD doesn't set correctly the language / keymaps settings
[07:08] <ubuntu_> in terminal, the ftp can send complete directory to another PC ?
[07:08] <haffe> greenman,  Thank you.
[07:08] <greenman> Fatal error: Call to undefined function curl_init().  shouldn't php5-curl fix this?
[07:09] <greenman> haffe: no problem.  we use that at work
[07:09] <epresly> thanks!
[07:09] <EvilGuru> can someone please take a look at this bug for me and see if it happens to them as well: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gnome-print/+bug/68934
[07:09] <hoz_> &n
[07:09] <hou5ton> do we have Ubuntu writing to ntfs yet, reliably etc.??
[07:09] <dabaR_> ubuntu_: mput is the command for multiple files and supports shell expansion such as *
[07:09] <matspekkie> so how can i get ubuntu installed on an dg965 core 2 duo ide-generic option does not work im tryiong to install from ide cdrom install on ide drive
[07:09] <lnx^> lupine_85: never mind, it worked with a library from debian sarge
[07:10] <BryanJK_> Ok, who sent me that Firmware?
[07:10] <lupine_85> !ntfs-3g
[07:10] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[07:10] <lnx^> but someone fix https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/54776 ASAP so i don't have to play around with dapper anymore ;)
[07:10] <ixian_> can someone running ubuntu dapper send me the login/logout sounds? i think they're in /usr/share/sounds ... called login.wav and logout.wav
[07:10] <bruenig> EvilGuru, I tried to download and open that file in evince, and it gave me Failed to load document (error 1) 'file:///tmp/PDF%20Bug.pdf'
[07:10] <lupine_85> BryanJK_: me
[07:10] <goffa_> not enough people in here.. lol
[07:10] <EvilGuru> try the document viewer
[07:10] <BryanJK_> lupine_85: what do I do with it? like do I place the .gw files in a directory somewhere?
[07:11] <taser> I'm having lots of trouble hooking up my laptop to my wireless router. Does anyone else have experience with this?
[07:11] <lupine_85> yes, like I said, untar it into /lib/firmware
[07:11] <bruenig> EvilGuru, evince = document viewer
[07:11] <greenman> Fatal error: Call to undefined function curl_init()
[07:11] <EvilGuru> bruenig: sorry there
[07:11] <greenman> I don't get it.
[07:11] <tan> anyone here got any experience with samba/CIFS filesharing on ubuntu?
[07:11] <TLE> ixian_: You know thay don't fit edgy right ?
[07:11] <BryanJK_> lupine_85: What if im running on a live cd?
[07:11] <ixian_> TLE, fit?
[07:11] <MeanGuy> bruenig, i think i did. however i still dont have sun-java-jre when i do apt-cache search java | grep jre ;/
[07:12] <lupine_85> BryanJK_: then you might not be able to do that. I think it's put into RAM though
[07:12] <dabaR_> greenman: we don't get it either, where did you get the error?
[07:12] <lupine_85> i.e. you might be able to
[07:12] <bruenig> MeanGuy, sudo apt-get install sun-java5-bin
[07:12] <lupine_85> there might be other ways to load the firmware up as well, but i'm not sure
[07:12] <bruenig> !info sun-java5-bin

[07:12] <ubotu> Package cinelerra does not exist in any distro I know

[07:12] <anne_> !info cinelerra-cvs
[07:12] <ubotu> Package cinelerra-cvs does not exist in any distro I know
[07:12] <zspada15> anyone know how to auto configure the edgy x server cmd line?
[07:12] <lnx^> am i not supposed to have some files in /etc/hibernate/scriptlets.d?
[07:12] <lnx^> (edgy)
[07:12] <EvilGuru> bruenig: I have just opended it on two of my ubuntu computers (6.10) with no problems
[07:12] <warkruid> matspekkie: what are the errors?
[07:13] <greenman> dabaR_:  it's in a blog software that worked in gentoo and isn't working now.  I'm sure i just have to install something but I haven't figured out what
[07:13] <dabaR_> zspada15: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-zorg
[07:13] <MeanGuy> bruenig,  :) can't find it ;l
[07:13] <lnx^> or where are the scripts that run when i hibernate/restore?
[07:13] <Lisama> the partiton extended is of the live cd?
[07:13] <dabaR_> what is the blog software, greenman ?
[07:13] <MeanGuy> E: Couldn't find package sun-java5-bin
[07:13] <greenman> dabaR_: I've installed curl and php5-curl.  and I already had libcurl3
[07:13] <dabaR_> MeanGuy: enable multiverse
[07:13] <ubuntu_> hot to run FTP -> recursive mput ?
[07:13] <greenman> dabaR_: serendipity.  I don't use it anymore, but it's got archives in it.
[07:13] <taser> I'm having lots of trouble hooking up my laptop to my wireless router. Does anyone else have experience with this?
[07:13] <bruenig> EvilGrin, I put a .pdf extension on the end of it and it opened
[07:14] <MeanGuy> dabaR_,  ;l dunno what that is. ;/ how do i do that?
[07:14] <Lisama> what mean the partition with extended filesystem??
[07:14] <TLE> ixian_: Oh ups that's only half right. I read it in a devel. spec. somewhere. They have been working on shortening down the shutdown sequence. Apparently they did such a good job of it that the sound they had originally intended for edgy had to replaced, so I's plausible the Dapper shutdown is to long too
[07:14] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  LOL what did i help u with ;/
[07:14] <sorush20> hi I keep getting a rotating blue box on ubuntu
[07:14] <sorush20> (18:14:07) sorush: fgl_glxgears
[07:14] <dabaR_> !multiverse > MeanGuy
[07:14] <matspekkie> warkruid it won't find the cdrom
[07:14] <miracel> when installing cupswrapper it finishes with "lpadmin: Unable to copy PPD file!", and I cant get a connection to the printer. how can I fix this?
[07:14] <MeanGuy> i dont remember :P
[07:14] <sorush20> !fglrx
[07:14] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:14] <EvilGuru> bruenig: Go file print and select a ps file as the 'printer' then open up the ps file
[07:14] <MeanGuy> dabaR_, thanx
[07:14] <scamboy> meanguy: does not matter...u helped someone though
[07:14] <bruenig> EvilGrin, yeah, it is a black box
[07:15] <warkruid> matspekkie: checked bios setup? can boot from cdrom?
[07:15] <EvilGuru> bruenig: The bug has been driving me mad
[07:15] <bruenig> EvilGuru, I meant, tab completion is not being very friendly today
[07:15] <MeanGuy> scamboy,  i always do when i know about the information. im just new , since its my 1st day, with time i'll help alot :P dont worry :P brb let me solve this problem 1st
[07:15] <bclough> Hi all, it seems that my gcc compiler is not recognizing stdio.h or any other libraries...do i need to get these separately from emacs?
[07:15] <BryanJK_> awww
[07:15] <BryanJK_> No wireless for me =(
[07:16] <bruenig> EvilGuru, it is probably driver based

[07:16] <ubotu> bryanJK: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[07:16] <Lisama> what mean the partition with extended filesystem??
[07:16] <stillunknown> how long would an avarage ubuntu install (using the alternate install cd) take?
[07:16] <bruenig> EvilGuru, or probably not if it does it with the .ps file too
[07:16] <dcraven> bclough, is build-essential installed?
[07:16] <lupine_85> stillunknown: under an hour
[07:16] <EvilGuru> bruenig: I am not sure where the problem lies
[07:16] <ixian_> TLE, oh well i managed to find the dapper sound files.. im gonna try em anyway
[07:16] <lupine_85> maybe as little as 30 minutes
[07:16] <matspekkie> warkruid it does boot the first part but when coming to install part it can'tfind it any more tried also the alternative boot
[07:16] <bclough> dcraven: not sure...very new to  ubuntu...should i install this?
[07:16] <dcraven> bclough, yes.
[07:16] <Lisama> what mean the partition with extended filesystem??
[07:16] <bclough> dcraven: thanks!
[07:16] <scamboy> lisama: another partition in the primary partition i guess
[07:17] <greenman> dabaR_: do I have to reinstall php5 or something?
[07:17] <dabaR_> greenman: and you are not compiling something, right?
[07:17] <moyote> vidd: dpkg-reconfigure gdm did the trick. Thanks everyone for your help.
[07:17] <TLE> ixian_: But I can send them to you 3 sec  :: Ok good luck
[07:17] <stillunknown> lupine_85: probably a bit longer, due to some partitions that have to be kept
[07:17] <Lisama> scamboy, could be the live cd??
[07:17] <bruenig> EvilGuru, you should try messing around with the postscript see if you can get it to work
[07:17] <greenman> dabaR_: what do you mean?
[07:17] <stillunknown> lupine_85: but thanks for the anser
[07:17] <ixian_> :)
[07:17] <dabaR_> greenman: what do you do that gives you that error, where is the error shown?
[07:17] <moyote> sorry wrong place.
[07:17] <lupine_85> the partitions bit takes < 5 minutes regardless of how complicated it is
[07:17] <scamboy> lisama...no its on hardrive..some kind of partition..
[07:17] <EvilGuru> bruenig: I am going to try and print it to a .ps file on my mac and see what happens when I open it
[07:17] <lupine_85> the bit that takes ages is the copying of files
[07:17] <Lisama> scamboy, i cant delete it and i cant do something to it , why??
[07:17] <warkruid> matspekkie:  had the same problem with my laptop, CD was not corrupt. Same with you maybe?
[07:18] <warkruid> 
[07:18] <difeta> does there exist program with will create a mosaic of photos?
[07:18] <Con-fuze-ed> can anyone tell me which linux-restricted-modules I should use if I am running the linux-server kernel
[07:18] <greenman> dabaR_: just loading a page that uses it.
[07:18] <lnx^> is there a repository for edgy with the kernel+suspend2 patch?
[07:18] <bruenig> EvilGuru, in document viewer, I did save copy as and saved it as whatever.ps and then opened that and printed it and it prints the text but not the little shading effect
[07:19] <greenman> dabaR_: I'm thinking from what I've been reading that php isn't compiled with curl support wehn you install lamp in dapper
[07:19] <dabaR_> Con-fuze-ed: try the generic
[07:19] <warkruid>  matspekkie: correction cd was corrupt. burned at wrong speed.
[07:19] <scamboy> !partition

[07:19] <david> i have three schedulers running anacron atd and cron, do i need all 3?
[07:19] <greenman> dabaR_: i'm not sure how to go about doin gthat.
[07:19] <EvilGuru> bruenig: interesting....
[07:19] <bclough> dcraven: works now thanks!  Do you know where these libraries are installed to?
[07:19] <BryanJK_> Hmmm
[07:19] <greenman> dabaR_: CURL doesn't show up in phpinfo
[07:19] <matspekkie> warkruid it does not reconize my ide controller
[07:19] <scamboy> lisama: go here http://www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives_01.htm
[07:20] <Con-fuze-ed> dabaR_: thanks
[07:20] <dabaR_> greenman: and you are sure you have the curl php package installed?
[07:20] <dabaR_> Con-fuze-ed: that was a guess, though.
[07:20] <bclough> dcraven: oh never mind i found it under /include :)
[07:20] <matspekkie> also 965 chipset might be to new maybe i just read it will be fully supported in kernel 2.18
[07:20] <lnx^> no suspend2 kernels for edgy?
[07:20] <danielinu> Hi, I'm installing Ubuntu 6.10 server release but when it reboots for the first time of the installation it stops to work. is it normal?
[07:20] <greenman> yeah, I just did apt-get install php5-curl
[07:20] <BryanJK_> Ok... Is there just an install for the drivers? Just something simple? (For Broadcom BCM4306)
[07:20] <matspekkie> oeps 2.6.18
[07:20] <warkruid> matspekkie: Windoze does recognize the ide controller?
[07:20] <greenman> php5-curl is already the newest version.
[07:21] <BryanJK_> ...Something i can run on the live disc..
[07:21] <matspekkie> yes works fine under windows
[07:21] <motin> I am about to order a dedicated webserver that is supposed to be used with videosharing with about 3 Tb bandwidth total. Everything is chosen except for if we want 32 or 64 bit based. What's the pros and cons here?
[07:21] <tan> anyone knows how to share files to windows?
[07:22] <bruenig> !samba | tan
[07:22] <ubotu> tan: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:22] <iami89> when i install wine or some game i encounter error :"error: C compiler cannot create executables" how to fix it?
[07:22] <dabaR_> greenman: where is the php.ini file? /etc/?
[07:22] <iami89> help me
[07:22] <matspekkie> i tried under mandrake that seems to work with all-generic-ide
[07:22] <greenman> dabaR_: lemme check
[07:22] <dabaR_> cat
[07:22] <warkruid> matspekkie: tried it with other distros? (grasping at straws..)
[07:22] <tan> thanks, I'll look at it :)
[07:23] <BryanJK_> Hmm..
[07:23] <greenman> dabaR_: /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
[07:23] <greenman> dabaR_: you think it's a setting in there?
[07:23] <dabaR_> greenman: cat /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini|grep curl to see
[07:23] <iami89> how to fix error: C compiler cannot create executables
=== [Jonne] __ is now known as [Jonne] 
[07:24] <dabaR_> iami89: try installing build-essential but that may be some other problem that you are having.
[07:24] <Shan`> sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 should mount my cdrom?
[07:24] <iami89> how to do it
[07:24] <greenman> dabaR_: the only thing in there is:  extension=curl.so
[07:24] <dabaR_> iami89: do you know how to install anything in Ubuntu?
[07:24] <bruenig> Shan`, check your /etc/fstab to see what it calls your cdrom, mine calls it /dev/hdc
[07:24] <dabaR_> greenman: no ; at the beginning of the line, to make it commented out?
[07:24] <iami89> yes
[07:25] <iami89> do you know other way?
[07:25] <wozcu> i just installed my first linux- ubuntu today to replace my sucky windoz, but tell me how to shut down x to install graphic drivers right??
[07:25] <superkirbyartist> What can you do with Ubuntu on iMac G3? Should I use Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu?
[07:25] <greenman> dabaR_: nope
[07:25] <greenman> hmm..
[07:25] <BryanJK_> Hmm
[07:25] <BryanJK_> I dont even think my wireless card is supported in ubuntu..
[07:25] <bruenig> wozcu,  you don't need to shutdown x to install drivers. You can install it with x going and then restart x to make the drivers take effect
[07:25] <matspekkie> wozcu sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[07:25] <dabaR_> greenman: find the curl.so file on your system. should be somewhere in the php5 dir.
[07:25] <tan> Ok, I've looked at the documentation and it seems I've read it already - my main problem is windows-users get a password-challenge when trying to access the samba-shared files...
[07:25] <wozcu> k ty
[07:25] <iami89> i tried but it not work
[07:25] <superkirbyartist> What can you do with Ubuntu on iMac G3? Should I use Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu?
[07:25] <greenman> dabaR_: i fixed it
[07:26] <greenman> dabaR_: I didn't restart apache after installing php5-curl
[07:26] <dabaR_> greenman: :-/...
[07:26] <greenman> I forgot that anytime you do anything to php you have to restart apache
[07:26] <dabaR_> greenman: good work, anyhow
[07:26] <kitche> superkirbyartist: well ther isn't really a difference between the three just that each one has  a different defaul desktop environment
[07:26] <greenman> dabaR_: thanks
[07:26] <greenman> and thanks for the help
[07:26] <tan> this isn't clear on any of the docs I've looked at....
[07:26] <JepZ> hi, does anyone know, which package i have to install, to get the /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-386/build/ directory
[07:27] <iami89> how to fix error: C compiler cannot create executables     when u install?
[07:27] <bruenig> superkirbyartist, depends on your preferences. Check out kde gnome and xfce on wikipedia or google them whatever you prefer to see what you think you might like. It is important to note that xfce may not look as great but uses very little resources and is very fast so just looking at screenshots of that may not do it justice.
[07:27] <superkirbyartist> I am using iMac G3 roughly 500mhz 256mb ram 30GB HD.
[07:27] <CientificoLoco> hello everybody, I want to install Amarok for Edgy; I installed amarok, libxine-extracodec, and amarok-engines; but in the wiki page says that If I want to install the last version of Amarok I have to add repositories; I see that this repositories are from Dapper mail, If I install them in edgy, will They work fine?
[07:27] <kitche> JepZ: try linux-headers dev package
[07:27] <greenman> this shouldn't be hard
[07:27] <iami89> i need your help
[07:27] <dcraven> JepZ, yeah, the headers package will help.
[07:27] <superkirbyartist> So far, prefer Gnome and KDE, but HATE XFce.
[07:27] <greenman> dabaR_: do you know how I can fix these to warnings
[07:27] <greenman> apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName

[07:27] <tan> bruenig:  Ok, I've looked at the documentation and it seems I've read it already - my main problem is windows-users get a password-challenge when trying to access the samba-shared files...
[07:27] <tan> bruenig: any ideas?
[07:27] <superkirbyartist> And I would like to install KDE on it.
[07:27] <who_care1> what's the command to get my version number?
[07:27] <BryanJK_> Is the Broadcom BCM4306 Wireless Card supported by Ubuntu??
[07:27] <bruenig> tan, no ideas. I just no how to trigger the factoid
[07:27] <JepZ> kitche:& dcraven :thx
[07:28] <tan> bruenig: ok, thanks anyway :)
[07:28] <superkirbyartist> How do you do that?  I get a black screen after the "Ubuntu" splash.
[07:28] <rag> dcraven: hi
[07:28] <dcraven> Hey rag.
[07:28] <bruenig> superkirbyartist, if you want kde, go with kubuntu. You can have both on one installation. Just do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop if you get kubuntu or, kubuntu-desktop if you go with ubuntu.
[07:28] <kai_> hello
[07:28] <bruenig> superkirbyartist, if you do that you can pick which one to login to at the login screen
[07:28] <warkruid>  /leave #ubuntu
[07:29] <tan> BryanJK_: look at the broadcom drivers page (oss project at berlios.de) - there u will find it if it's supported
[07:29] <rag> dcraven: regards!
[07:29] <superkirbyartist> Okay.  So with the ubuntu CD, type "kubuntu-desktop" and just set up a server.  How do you do that from the 6.06 LTS cds?
[07:29] <CientificoLoco> hello everybody, I want to install Amarok for Edgy; I installed amarok, libxine-extracodec, and amarok-engines; but in the wiki page says that If I want to install the last version of Amarok I have to add repositories; I see that this repositories are from Dapper mail, If I install them in edgy, will They work fine?
[07:29] <dcraven> BryanJK_, it works with ndiswrapper.
[07:29] <bruenig> superkirbyartist, what cd do you have?
[07:29] <Sp4rKy> please, really nobody have idea for my language / keymap issue ?
[07:29] <superkirbyartist> "Ubuntu PowerPc 6.06(.1?) LTS"
[07:29] <BryanJK_> dcraven: ok
[07:30] <bruenig> CientificoLoco, if the setup is the same it will work the same
[07:30] <kitche> Sp4rKy: you can have the user select the keymap and such
[07:30] <CientificoLoco> bruenig, but how can I know if is the same setup?
[07:30] <craigermendel> Anyone know how to add a folder to usr from the GUI when the option is letting me?
[07:30] <who_care1> how do I find my kernel version number?
[07:30] <Sp4rKy> kitche: this is my issue: i select the keymap at boot but when the live start i've always the wrong keymap
[07:30] <bruenig> superkirbyartist, ok, well that should install ubuntu, not kubuntu. After you install from that disc. If you want to install kde alongside the default gnome. You will have to open a command prompt and type, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[07:30] <georgeb> who_care1: uname -a
[07:31] <dabaR_> greenman: it is in the .conf apache file
[07:31] <who_care1> thanks
[07:31] <superkirbyartist> How can you choose Gnome or KDE at boot?  Can you remove Gnome if I don't like it?
[07:31] <wilberfan> what should I look for/avoid in selecting a new sound card??
[07:31] <bruenig> CientificoLoco, see if anyone else has done it. It is very very likely that it is the same
[07:31] <augustin> !faq
[07:31] <ubotu> faq is http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions Official documentation is at http://help.ubuntu.com IRC FAQ: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRCResourcePage
[07:31] <greenman> dabaR_: which one, I found a few
[07:31] <BryanJK_> Lol... "The server at ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net is taking too long to respond."
[07:32] <scamboy> u see sourceforge is DOWN!!!!
[07:32] <dcraven> BryanJK_, it's in the repos. Version 1.8 is what you want.
[07:32] <kitche> BryanJK_: sourceforge hosting is down that is all
[07:32] <CientificoLoco> bruenig, I will do..
[07:32] <Pablo> lol
[07:32] <kitche> scamboy: it's not down just their hosting is
[07:32] <dabaR_> greenman: which file or which line in it?
[07:32] <heyoshots> hi, i can't get the xserver to start when installing ubuntu.  What's the best way to do a no-gui install?
[07:32] <scamboy> hate it!!!
[07:32] <greenman> dabaR_: which file?
[07:32] <augustin> where can I find a good list of programs I should install?
[07:32] <craigermendel> Does anyone know the command for adding a new directory?  I am trying to put a folder into usr.
[07:32] <scamboy> my gaim just crashed..
[07:32] <greenman> apache2.conf, httpd.conf
[07:33] <kitche> craigermendel: sudo mkdir <directory name>
[07:33] <dabaR_> greenman: httpd.conf, likely. I use apache1.3

[07:33] <bruenig> heyoshots, you can use the alternate cd. Or you can use the server cd and then after it installs and you boot into it just do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[07:33] <dabaR_> greenman: I used the other one too, but don't have it installed here now.
[07:33] <baxter_kylie> Hi. Having a pickle of a problem with MySql though someone might know what to do: I had to remove it because mythtv-backend somehow managed to corrupt everything including dependencies. Both it and mysql-server had to be removed by hand. I've autocleaned and remove --purged both packages and tried to reinstall mysql-server but it doesn't set itself up and create /etc/mysql -- what do I do?
[07:33] <dabaR_> post the file that has something in it to pastebin, the other files really have nothing in them, only one really does.
[07:33] <heyoshots> awesome thanks
[07:33] <greenman> dabaR_: alright I'll check that
[07:33] <wilberfan> (gawd, should I repeat my question?)
[07:34] <augustin>  dcraven: I saw a good list of many basic programs to install...like video player, cd burner etc
[07:34] <dcraven> augustin, why not use that list then?
[07:34] <bruenig> wilberfan, that is probably a question better answered in the forums...
[07:34] <augustin>  dcraven: I lost its address...
[07:34] <wilberfan> bruenig, thanks...I've tried that.   No response in a couple of days....
[07:35] <greenman> dabaR_: I'm not seeing anything about ServerName
[07:35] <dabaR_> wilberfan: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsSoundCards?highlight=%28sound%29%7C%28card%29
[07:35] <wilberfan> dabaR_, thanks...I'll check that out.   What kind of cards are YOU using?
[07:35] <dabaR_> greenman: me neither, since you never posted the file to pastebin...
[07:35] <dabaR_> wilberfan: on-board ones.
[07:35] <sioux> who knows democracy player
[07:35] <augustin> anyway.. what do I need to install to change my screen resolution to something bigger then 800x600 ?
[07:35] <bruenig> sioux, democracy player sucks
[07:35] <wilberfan> dabaR_, ah...me too...
[07:36] <sioux> sucks what
[07:36] <wilberfan> I'll check out that link---thanks dudes.
[07:36] <dabaR_> sioux: I know the guy called democracy player, did you want to leave a message for him?
[07:36] <teclo> Hello, since I have upgraded to edgy, sensors gives the following error messages: Can't access procfs/sysfs file;Unable to find i2c bus information;   .. but sysfs and procfs are there... and libsensors3 is installed... any idea ?
[07:36] <XiXaQ> I'm trying out Xen, but I can't get internet in the DomU. How do I configure internet on the guest?
[07:37] <BryanJK_> ok
[07:37] <greenman> dabaR_: looks like I just need to add a ServerName to apache2.conf.
[07:37] <lupine_85> XiXaQ: xen fakes an ethernet adaptor which has a special module you need to load
[07:37] <sioux> democracy opens too much localhost ports... i don't like it very much
[07:37] <sioux> it sounds bad
[07:37] <dabaR_> localhost ports? really?
[07:38] <dabaR_> sioux: how do you even know this?
[07:38] <who_care1> is /usr/src/linux-2.6.17-10-generic the normal path for the kernel source?
[07:38] <lupine_85> if something's bound to localhost, it's not an issue
[07:38] <sioux> netstat and firestarter
[07:38] <greenman> ahah
[07:38] <greenman> now I just have this error
[07:38] <greenman> [Sun Nov 05 12:38:19 2006]  [warn]  NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts

[07:40] <who_care1> is /usr/src/linux-2.6.17-10-generic the normal kernel source path?
[07:40] <DrNick> I know this isn't really the place to discuss this, but is anyone else having problems connecting to DALnet?
[07:40] <Pablo> anyone know where there is a line under my cursor about 1/4inch bellow it?
[07:40] <sioux> to me seems a not secure democracy player
[07:40] <lupine_85> I'm afraid not :( - it's built into the kernel that my domU uses
[07:40] <craigermendel> Anyone know why edgy doesn't ask for the sudo password when you try to do somthing root related?  I am sick of being rejected by the GUI.  Why can't it just cooperate like the terminal does:)
[07:40] <lupine_85> (I don't administer the dom0)
[07:40] <dcraven> who_care1, the headers are typically installed there.
[07:41] <dabaR_> sioux: democracy is a bad system anyhow, I would like to reinstate tiranny. and no news either, no computers whatsoever in fact.
[07:41] <DrNick> craigermendel, it does for me :/
[07:41] <lupine_85> sioux: a port bound to localhost is /not/ insecure
[07:41] <lupine_85> 'though  sockets are better :p
[07:41] <bruenig> craigermendel, there are some nautilus scripts that allow a right click feature enabling you to do things as root I believe
[07:42] <sioux> lupine why it needs open localhost
[07:42] <who_care1> so what do I type here: "Linux kernel source directory [/usr/src/linux-2.6.17-10-generic] : "
[07:42] <lupine_85> cups uses the same feature. does that make it insecure?

[07:42] <XiXaQ> lupine_85, what is the name of the nic in your DomU?
[07:43] <sioux> lupine here the localhost are connected source 127.0.0.0 destinationsame address
[07:43] <lupine_85> yeah, that's fine
[07:43] <lupine_85> XiXaQ: the active ethernet interface is called eth1
[07:43] <lupine_85> there's a load of inactive ones with weird names
[07:44] <XiXaQ> lupine_85, internet sharing should be automatically enabled when the connected interface is bridged with the domu?
[07:44] <lupine_85> sioux: anything bound to localost can only be seen by... ou guessed it... the local host
[07:44] <lupine_85> XiXaQ: I believe so, but haven't set that bit up myseldf
[07:44] <lupine_85> you might need to enable ip forwarding on the host machine, though?
[07:44] <craigermendel> Could anyone tell me the command to copy a file from one place to another?
[07:45] <dcraven> craigermendel, cp myfile newlocation

[07:46] <DrNick> does anyone know if there's a tool availble to batch-convert a load of mp3 files into ogg without too much trouble?
[07:46] <lupine_85> pgm: not very werll
[07:46] <lupine_85> the live CD won't work, but the alt install CD will
[07:46] <DrNick> pgm - the server one should be fine
[07:46] <lupine_85> !alternate
[07:46] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[07:46] <lupine_85> if it has problems (though it shouldn't), manually activate some swap as soon as it's been created

[07:50] <MenZa> georgeb: and the full filename?
[07:51] <sioux> people is there a sort of scandisk for ubuntu?
[07:51] <georgeb> MenZa: I don't know, it might be in there, or in /usr/share/gnome*

[07:53] <rsk> BryanJK_: download a ubuntu .iso burn it and install,next.
[07:53] <kitche> porkpie: what goes in /usr/local/etc should be stuff that you compile really

[07:54] <kitche> porkpie: the configuratoin files go in /usr/local/etc for things that you compile yourself
[07:54] <porkpie> kitche:cool ...OK then the server should be OK
[07:54] <BryanJK_> rsk: i cant get my Hardrive to mount
[07:54] <The_Belgain> am i better off just installing from the version on the Azureus website?
[07:54] <kitche> porkpie: yeah
[07:54] <BryanJK_> rsk: so i cant access the files, nor install it
[07:54] <SpComb> BryanJK_: mount? What error does it give? Where does it give it?
[07:55] <BryanJK_> SpComb: it says something about its not removable, and it cannot excute pbmount? or something...

[07:55] <slinky_> Hello folks, I was using XMMS Music Player in Dapper and somehow my Equalizer no longer will work, any ideas on how to re-enable it?
[07:55] <claudiu> i have a weird networking problem
[07:55] <Akuma_> when i boot the CD, and choose 'boot or install' (somehting like that) the computer just reboots and i get the same menu over again
[07:56] <Akuma_> can i fix that?
[07:56] <claudiu> can anyone explain why my IP address changes by itself ?
[07:56] <Akuma_> maybe the cd is corrupted? i cant test it though, cause then the same happens, it just reboots again
[07:56] <Akuma_> claudiu: dynamic IP ?
[07:56] <BryanJK_> claudiu: because that's how you/your isp have it setup
[07:57] <claudiu> Akuma_:  my isp gateway is in one class, and i haev my ip in other class

[08:07] <josh_> what is a thin wrapper?
[08:07] <claudiu> Cromag: I wonder if I have been subject to spoofing or something
[08:07] <Mahmoud85> claudiu: 169.254.x.x means that it failed to get an IP from a DHCP.
[08:07] <gumpish> wow, so... upstart is like having init start everything at the same time?
[08:07] <Cromag> claudiu: you just have to configure ur eth if for static ip :)~

[08:34] <superkirbyartist> I am trying to install Ubuntu on iMac. I can only get a terminal. Help please.

[08:35] <Justy-> Hello, Is there a tool that I can see which application uses which port? Thanks
[08:35] <claudiu> Cromag: is it possible the mess is coming from zeroconf, someone here said something about that
[08:35] <lupine_85> and next time ask on #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl :p
[08:35] <nanda> shini`: I'll try
[08:35] <shini`> ok
[08:35] <Cromag> claudiu: dont know actually.
[08:35] <madman91> i have an nvidia 7800gt graphics card... and i start ubuntu 6.10 install with safe graphics.. and the graphics (when they load up) are distorted beyond comphrension.. what do i do >?
[08:35] <Cromag> but i dont think i can help after all-

[08:35] <recon0> lupine_85: determined at compiletime, evidently. More makefile editing to come.

[08:35] <Justy-> hey lupine_85 !
[08:36] <superkirbyartist> I am trying to install Ubuntu on iMac. I can only get a terminal. Help please.
[08:36] <lupine_85> 'lo
[08:36] <cypher1> is there any good dvd player which can skip bad sectors while playing the dvd ?
[08:36] <superkirbyartist> HeLlO?!
[08:36] <BHSPitLappy> ubuntulog, you mean a program?
[08:36] <LordDiabolus> Hello!
[08:36] <BHSPitLappy> superkirbyartist, please elaborate.
[08:37] <nanda> shini`: I just tried installing nvidia-glx with aptitude instead and seems to have worked!
[08:37] <shini`> yeah
[08:37] <recon0> superkirbyartist: we can't answer without a question.
[08:37] <garrett> Does anybody know a work-around for problems running update-initramfs under a LVM or a cryptoloop partition?
[08:37] <jerp> madman, are your NV drivers uptodate?
[08:37] <shini`> nanda, usually it gets all the dependencies as well
[08:37] <BHSPitLappy> cypher1, it may be that your drive itself is the one trying to re-read those sectors
[08:37] <superkirbyartist> iMac DV G3 256MB MEM 30GB HD maybe 500mhz processor.  I can ONLY get terminal (no x gui).  Please help me install it.
[08:37] <shini`> nanda, but don't forget you will probably have to change the "nv" to "nvidia" in your xorg.conf
[08:37] <nanda> shini`: ok
[08:38] <shini`> in the drivers section nanda
[08:38] <cypher1> BHSPitLappy, oh so the hardware itself tries to reread it ?
[08:38] <LordDiabolus> hey superkirby: did you try ati drivers?
[08:38] <Justy-> Hello, Is there a tool that I can see which application uses which port? I want to know which port does gksu update manager uses while upgrading to edgy... Thanks
[08:38] <superkirbyartist> Ati?
[08:38] <nanda> shini`: I am working through this tutorial: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Edgy
[08:38] <LordDiabolus> if I remember right, ATI is the maker for most Mac video cards
[08:38] <nanda> thanks for ur help
[08:38] <cypher1> BHSPitLappy, can i control it by some tunable ?
[08:39] <superkirbyartist> so I get yaboot.  What do I type to load ATI?
[08:39] <shini`> nanda, oh you're on edgy, i'm still using dapper heh... no problem though
[08:39] <recon0> Does anybody know how to edit the "library path"?
[08:39] <BHSPitLappy> cypher1, usually, yeah.  what you might want to try, is to use a ripping program to save the disc to an ISO file, (you'll have retry settings in there)
[08:39] <BHSPitLappy> cypher1, such as k3b
[08:39] <shini`> nanda, i've also heard that vim on edgy isn't the full vim so you may have to apt-get vim-full if you're going to use vim
[08:39] <cypher1> BHSPitLappy, thanks i have k3b installed :)
[08:40] <bordy> Hey folks, anyone having trouble upgrading with a failed to fetch error? I've been looking around for answers, and havent gotten it yet
[08:40] <superkirbyartist> How do you boot the live/install with ATI?
[08:40] <nanda> shini`: not sure what vim is, should I install it anyway, just in case?
[08:40] <LordDiabolus> superkirbyartist: when you are at the console, try using lynx (or links or elinks) to go to www.ati.com, then browse to their ATI drivers.  They should come with instructions
[08:40] <madman91> i have an nvidia 7800gt graphics card.... a 6.10 ubuntu 64bit cd ... and when i start the installer with 'safe graphics' it gives me a distorted screen.. in fedora install the same thing happeneed.. but they have a text installer.. does ubuntu have a text installer ?
[08:40] <madman91> or does ubuntu have my drivers?
[08:40] <BHSPitLappy> cypher1, go to Copy DVD, check the "only make image" box, and mess with the retry settings
[08:40] <superkirbyartist> But I'm only using the 6.06 live/install CD.  Why do I need drivers to startx?
[08:40] <shini`> nanda, vim is a text-editor, it's a very useful tool. but most people don't really like to use it at first because it's a little straight
[08:40] <LordDiabolus> usually the livecd will boot fine with ATI, but you can always try the "alternate install" cd from ubuntu.com.  It works on well on tricky video hardware
[08:40] <nanda> ok
[08:41] <Justy-> question: What port does Edgy update use while downloading the updates ?
[08:41] <BHSPitLappy> maddlah, you can download the Alternate CD.
[08:41] <BHSPitLappy> it's a text installer.
[08:41] <shini`> nanda, but it's very small so if you want you can put it on anyway
[08:41] <madman91> BHSPitLappy: you meant madman91  right?
[08:41] <superkirbyartist> But it will take a lot of time to download.
[08:41] <nanda> shini`: ok, I will
[08:41] <BHSPitLappy> madman91, yes. yes I did.
[08:41] <superkirbyartist> What do I type from the live CD?
[08:41] <LordDiabolus> it may, but it should work better
[08:41] <bordy> Anyone? Help on a failed-to-fetch error so I can finally upgrade? :( lol
[08:41] <SupremacyGnu> could someone please help me? I'm getting really tired of my problem. Can't remove anything because it says that the package named libc6-dev contain a empty filename... please help! thanks
[08:41] <CientificoLoco> do somebody know if there is some plugins for aMSN, that insform from Amarok which Music I'm listening ...??
[08:41] <madman91> LordDiabolus and BHSPitLappy : what happens after install.. will i need to isntall my drivers like i did in fc5?
[08:41] <shini`> nanda, it's a console editor. it's actually the program I use for writing scripts/programs, etc..
[08:42] <BHSPitLappy> superkirbyartist, unfortunately it's not included there.
[08:42] <cypher1> BHSPitLappy, thanks i will try it
[08:42] <CientificoLoco> do somebody know if there is some plugin for aMSN, that inform from Amarok which Music I'm listening ...??
[08:42] <LordDiabolus> madman91: what are you installing on?
[08:42] <hp_> how do i go to the swedish forum
[08:42] <Liguidsoul> Just installed Ubuntu. Why does the resolution only go up to 1024 x 768? I'm using a 6600 GT
[08:42] <LordDiabolus> liquidsoul: have you tried the drivers from www.nvidia.com?
[08:42] <bordy> hp_ go to  #ubuntu-se
[08:43] <madman91> LordDiabolus: my computer... 64bit desktop
[08:43] <shini`> Liguidsoul, you might have to modify your xorg.conf to put more resolutions on. or try installing the drivers
[08:43] <hp_> thanks
[08:43] <superkirbyartist> If I download the server and install my own packages, will it work?
[08:43] <hp_> tack
[08:43] <madman91> LordDiabolus: in fc5 i installed my nvidia drivers through yum.. from the livna repo.. is there an equivalent in ubuntu?
[08:43] <jerp> super, find a location close to you......... I'm on a cable t1 and found edgy at OleMiss U  they got it over to me in Atlanta in under 30 mins.  verify the md5 and Burn it at a slower speed.
[08:43] <LordDiabolus> mandman: what did you mean by "what happens after install"?  Could you elaborate, I'm not quite following...
[08:44] <JosefK> TLE: out of interest, did that video= trick work?
[08:44] <LordDiabolus> madman91:  yes, if you edit /etc/apt/sources.lst and remove the "#" from each line that starts with "#deb", you should be set.  An EXCELLENT resource for all of this is www.ubuntuguide.org
[08:45] <madman91> LordDiabolus: .. well in fc5 .. i installed with text installer.. then my video still did not work ... so i had to install the drivers.. then start x
[08:45] <madman91> LordDiabolus: thanks.. ill check it out
[08:45] <tim167> hi all, sudo dhclient returns "no working leases in persisten database" what should I do to get pc online ?
[08:45] <superkirbyartist> I use USA bittorrent.  Faster (More than 50kbps) than download (10kbps).
[08:45] <DanglyBits> where can I find nice themes and artwork for edgy?
[08:45] <Bernardo> hi
[08:45] <JosefK> !gnomelook
[08:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gnomelook - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <Streak> hi
[08:45] <JosefK> DanglyBits: http://www.gnomelook.org/
[08:45] <Bernardo> !hostap
[08:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hostap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <LordDiabolus> madman91: no prob.  As for nvidia drivers, the way I do it is download them using lynx in text mode, and then run the text installer.  It can be complicated if you're not used to it
[08:46] <Streak> how is every1 doing?
[08:46] <lupine_85> why not use linux-restricted-modules instead?
[08:46] <lupine_85> much easier :p
[08:46] <superkirbyartist> For server CD, it will install only terminal (no x)?
[08:46] <madman91> LordDiabolus: im fairly comfortable with cli... so you go to nvidia.com or wherever and download them?
[08:46] <Liguidsoul> What's command to authenticate as root again
[08:46] <LordDiabolus> restricted modules?  Haven't had much luck with those...
[08:46] <superkirbyartist> Liguidsool: sudo
[08:46] <lupine_85> it's just the installer, repackaged
[08:46] <nonnys> Hey Im having trouble installing ubuntu. The installation cant find my partitions
[08:46] <KillerDemon> with  -alternate  you can choose everything you want
[08:47] <KillerDemon> the alternate cd
[08:47] <superkirbyartist> A server install has no gui?
[08:47] <KillerDemon> alternate cd had text mode installer
[08:47] <KillerDemon> :D
[08:47] <Liguidsoul> When I type sudo it just shows me usage, such as -K, -L, -V, etc.
[08:47] <LordDiabolus> madman91: okay, first do "sudo apt-get install lynx" to get a text browser installed, then run lynx, type "g" to go to a site, then type in www.nvidia.com, then navigate to drivers, linux, your platform, etc.  This will download the latest/greatest driver
[08:47] <superkirbyartist> But server?
[08:47] <superkirbyartist> !server
[08:47] <ubotu> Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current stable version is 6.06 LTS. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/
[08:47] <Liguidsoul> !sudo
[08:47] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:47] <superkirbyartist> !gksudo
[08:47] <ubotu> If you need to run graphical applications as root, use gksudo, as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using sudo {guiapp}
[08:48] <madman91> LordDiabolus: one last question... its an evga card... but nvidia chip... i still get nvidia drivers right?
[08:48] <Streak> any 1 play counter strike 1.6 here ??????
[08:48] <jerp> liquid, do a .... sudo -i  and it should ask for password
[08:48] <LordDiabolus> madman91: evga?  I'm not familiar with that, what model card/chipset is it?
[08:48] <Otacon22> Exist a version of Ubuntu for firewalling??
[08:48] <madman91> LordDiabolus: evga 7800gt .... its an nvidia card though
[08:48] <nonnys> I have windows on a NTFS partition and a couple of logical, and now Im trying to install ubuntu but ubuntu installer wont recognize my partitions and say "unallocated" comeone know whats goin on?
[08:49] <Lrrr> is there a way to deactivate the autoremove output when apt is running?
[08:49] <madman91> LordDiabolus: evga 7800gt ... geforce 7800 chip
[08:49] <jerp> otacon, ipkungfu is a good firewall
[08:49] <SupremacyGnu> could someone please help me? I'm getting really tired of my problem. Can't remove anything because it says that the package named libc6-dev contain a empty filename... please help! thanks
[08:49] <Arcad3> nonnyns
[08:49] <LordDiabolus> madman91: 7800?  Yes, the newest nvidia drivers cover those, it's the chipset that the driver controls, you should be good with it
[08:49] <eli> Can somebody help? After upgrading to 6.10, usplash problem and also can not start x-server.
[08:49] <Arcad3> make the partitions with partition magic in WIN first
[08:49] <jerp> otacon, #ipkungfu has a channel on this net, go there and catch their links
[08:49] <madman91> LordDiabolus: thanks
[08:50] <msikma> Hi everybody. For some reason GCC keeps saying that stdio.h cannot be found when I'm trying to compile silly hello world programs (I'm trying to learn C).
[08:50] <madman91> msikma: try ##C .. its on this server
[08:50] <mluser-home> What does it mean when 'following packages have been kept back'?
[08:51] <msikma> It started doing that since I upgraded to Edgy.
[08:51] <msikma> Thoughts?
[08:51] <nonnys> is there not any other way ? I mean all the partitions are there I can even mount them but the installer wont recognize them
[08:51] <Liguidsoul> How do I exit the X server?
[08:52] <nonnys> and now I cant even install ubuntu
[08:52] <Liguidsoul> !x

[08:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about y - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:52] <lupine_85> ...favourtism...? ;)
[08:52] <Liguidsoul> Arcad3: Numeric argument required
[08:52] <msikma> madman91: since I could do it just fine on Dapper, and no longer on Edgy, I guess this has something to do with the dist-upgrade
[08:52] <feryana> hi!  I have a question, is not about linux but I don't know well how to write something, which one is good "He said me" or "He said to me"??????
[08:52] <Arcad3> sorry
[08:52] <msikma> feryana: the second one
[08:53] <lupine_85> "he said to me"
[08:53] <msikma> Even better would be: "he told me"
[08:53] <lupine_85> well, depending on context
[08:53] <madman91> msikma: i was just suggesting.. not kicking you out :D ../ i too am learning C .. good luck with your problem!
[08:53] <feryana> ok thanks. I just moved to US since january and my grammar suck
[08:53] <msikma> madman91: thanks :)
[08:53] <feryana> thanks. I really appreciated it
[08:53] <msikma> feryana: there are two situations
[08:54] <mluser-home> Does anyone know what it means when aptitude says  packages have been KEPT back ?
[08:54] <Liguidsoul> !X
[08:54] <msikma> feryana: for example: "he said 'hello' to me". and "he told me that she was pregnant".

[08:54] <feryana> msikma which ones. The one that I use always is "The associate said (to) me that...."
[08:54] <feryana> oh
[08:54] <Liguidsoul> How can I exit X so that I can install the nVIDIA driver?
[08:54] <feryana> I think that I got it
[08:54] <msikma> Whether you use "say" or "tell" doesn't really matter
[08:55] <lupine_85>  /etc/init.d/?dm stop
[08:55] <msikma> Most of the time
[08:55] <msikma> Well, good luck

[08:58] <nonnys> thanks but I did that just now and ubuntu installer cant find the partitions on the HD
[08:58] <BHSPitLappy> uhh
[08:58] <lorddiabolus> adriijas: put them in /etc/modules
[08:58] <SupremacyGnu> jrib, I would. But since I have my ubuntu in swedish I can't because you wouldn't understand anything.. is there anyway to change the language on my terminal?
[08:58] <msikma> blah.
[08:59] <msikma> Just went to ##c but they couldn't help me.
[08:59] <andriijas> lorddiabolus: how do i know wich "them" are? is there no script to just auto detect it?

[08:59] <msikma> It seems that I can no longer compile C programs with gcc ever since I upgraded to Edgy.

[09:00] <avagant> I was wondering why edgy was running sluggish, then I created a nice little swap and bam. Everything back to normal.
[09:00] <msikma> btw: how can I check in a terminal simply whether a package exists or not?
[09:01] <lupine_85> apt-cache search
[09:01] <lorddiabolus> msikma:  "apt-cache search <package>"

[09:02] <msikma> Well, thanks for the build-essential suggestion. I'm not sure whether I have it or not, but apt recommended 30 MB of related software when I tried to apt-get it.

[09:03] <jerp> otacon22, ipkungfu is a good firewall
[09:03] <avagant> I guess it would be a bad idea for me to try combining both my hd's or having hdb use some of it's memory for hda (boot)

[09:05] <Arcad3> how can i see what DNS offers my LAN?
[09:05] <JamieBE> clearzen - I am having trouble copying media TO the device, I can recognise and read the contents of the device fine, so I am guessing, as with many Linux things, this is asimply a permissions issue.
[09:05] <clearzen> JamieBE: what are you trying to do with the music player? Copy files to it?
[09:05] <JamieBE> ClearZen: Yep.
[09:06] <avagant> Anyone else attempt to make 2 hd's into one on ubuntu?
[09:06] <lupine_85> JamieBE: add gid=46 to the mount string (or to fstab)
[09:06] <cypher1> Arcad3, can you clarify your question ?
[09:06] <Markive> was is nautilus?
[09:06] <Markive> what is*
[09:06] <bulmer> Arcad3: dhclient or an equivalent
[09:06] <lupine_85> group 46 is disks IIRc
[09:06] <lorddiabolus> Markive: nautilus is the file manager
[09:06] <RawSewage> Can someone help me?  Audacity crashes with the following error:  Segmentation fault

[09:06] <Markive> thanks you lorddiabolus

[09:08] <JamieBE> ClearZen: I have fstab open, and I see 4 HDA's
[09:08] <cypher1> Arcad3, you need to have access to the DNS server to view it
[09:09] <sam11> does anyone know what "bcmxx microcode load failed"mean
[09:09] <SupremacyGnu> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30318/ thanks for looking at it

[09:11] <JunK-Y> ive installed edgy, and im getting: Your PHP installation does not support PostgreSQL. You need to recompile PHP using the --with-pgsql configure option.", which package will solve that issue exactly? ive tried libapache-mod-php4 w/out success.

[09:12] <SupremacyGnu> jrib, yes. sudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6-dev.list
[09:12] <JunK-Y> Arcad3: i would prefer using ubuntu packages.
[09:12] <lorddiabolus> sam11: there is, but I've had no luck with it.  If you look into the ndiswrapper project, which uses the windows drivers as a module in linux, you'll have much better luck.  Just make sure you add bcm5xx to the blacklist first
[09:12] <sundari> overridex-laptop: bitme.org or demonoid.com
[09:13] <Arcad3> xampp is easy to install and way too easy to configure
[09:13] <cypher1> Arcad3, my understanding is when you buy a domain you need to have a DNS server which i guess you will be mentioning while registering the domain

[09:14] <clearzen> JamieBE: is your media player a usb device?
[09:14] <jrib> SupremacyGnu: very different: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30319/  I'm not sure of the "right" way to fix this.  Try removing libc6-dev (maybe try 'dpkg -r libc6-dev').  But I don't think that will work.  I'm going to google a bit
[09:14] <JamieBE> ClearZen: It is.
[09:14] <Arcad3> if i have DYNDNS www.example.dyndns.com can i make www.example.example.dyndns.com from Apache?
[09:15] <B-Minus_> hello
[09:15] <JunK-Y> i had php4-pgsql, still the same problem.
[09:15] <lorddiabolus> Arcad3: I know it can be done, but I'm not the Apache admin at my work, so I'm afraid I don't know that one...
[09:15] <JunK-Y> i dont care to use php4 or php5.
[09:16] <B-Minus_> is there some linux variant for DUmeter (tool to see upload/download -> you can see on what time how much is downloaded/uploaded
[09:16] <SupremacyGnu> jrib, ok, thanks for the help! No, dpkg -r libc6-dev does not work, neither do apt-get remove libc6-dev
[09:16] <hanasaki> i have installed vlock by apt-get .... it always says the password entered is wrong.....
[09:16] <cypher1> Arcad3, i guess it can be achieved by configuring the DNS server for dyndns.org
[09:16] <clearzen> JamieBE: Basicly you need to add the following to your fstab file: /dev/sda1 /media/mediaplayer vfat default,users,owner,gid=022,uid=022     0       0
[09:16] <Arcad3> i missed that

[09:23] <intrico> I thought under Linux, applications were supposed to run in their own memory space?

[09:24] <chuckyp> CientificoLoco, why don't you do a channel list and look in there.  Or better yet a google search
[09:24] <JamieBE> ClearZen: When I try and copy an MP3 to the device, it just hands, and does nada.
[09:24] <jrib> SupremacyGnu: I mean few websites on google.  You could do 'sudo mv /var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6-dev.list ~/libc6-dev.list.backup && sudo apt-get --reinstall install libc6-dev'
[09:24] <JamieBE> ClearZen, sure.
[09:24] <DrNick_> I have a friend who's tried Ubuntu but would like to try Kubuntu, as apparantly he prefers KDE. would he have to re-install with Kunbuntu, or could he just remove the ubuntu-desktop package and install the kubuntu-desktop package?
[09:24] <bordy> lorddiabolus: I have used the update manager as well as the terminal (cant describe too well because I needed walking through it to do it) but then one step didn't work because of a failure to fetch error with one of the repositories
[09:25] <lorddiabolus> DrNick_:  he can just apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[09:25] <sparr> DrNick_: the latter
[09:25] <intrico> I never tried control-alt-f1 .... will try that next time it happens
[09:25] <CientificoLoco> chuckyp, how can I do that?
[09:25] <sparr> DrNick_: he doesnt even have to remove ubuntu-desktop, you can have both

[09:26] <fizzman> ive downloaded and installed hotsmtp chuckyp but don't know how to set it up
[09:26] <lorddiabolus> bordy: failure to fetch is occuring on a package or a software repository?  do you have the error message?
[09:26] <JunK-Y> is there any way to solve that issue: Your PHP installation does not support PostgreSQL. You need to recompile PHP using the --with-pgsql configure option.  , just with some ubuntu packages, dont want to recompile, was working fine on dapper.
[09:26] <bordy> Lorddiabolus: No, and sadly i cant even remember how to get the update to run... gimme a sec and I can get it I think.
[09:26] <chuckyp> CientificoLoco, open a web browser.  Its an application to view the interweb then you gots to put www.google.com  in the address bar.  In the text box you type sound juicer irc   click SEARCH
[09:26] <LuisMendes> I'm trying to run btscanner but it says: log_init::open(): No such file or directory. Can someone help me on this issue?

[09:27] <jrib> SupremacyGnu: can you do 'sudo apt-get install libc6-dev'

[09:28] <lorddiabolus> bordy: sounds like that mirror could be down (yet again).  If you can edit /etc/apt/sources.lst with your favorite editor and change http://us.archive... to http://archive....
[09:28] <eli> PROBLEM: No usable theme found for 1280x1024 in usplash? How to solve this?
[09:28] <chuckyp> klerfayt, yeah if you want a gui based one perhaps check out cinerella  or someone else might have a recomendation.
[09:28] <threeseas> gnome-commander  - lies when you try to edit a remote file
[09:28] <bordy> lorddiabolus: I really dont know how to do that... able to explain possibly? (sorry, I promise I'm not stupid... just new. lol)
[09:28] <SupremacyGnu> jrib, nope. None upgraded or reinstalled.... but when trying to remove beryl I get linux-libc-dev contains missing filename
[09:29] <ryanakca> if you generate a new gpg key every year or two, is there an easy way to decrypt all the files encrypted with the old key and reencrypt them with the new key?
[09:29] <JamieBE> I have so many problems with Ubuntu at the moment, I am starting to suspect that the tacheon fields are disrupting my sensors.
[09:29] <fizzman> does any1 know how to setup hotsmtpd?
[09:29] <lorddiabolus> bordy: hey, no prob, newbies are the future!  go to a command line and type "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.lst"  without the quotes
[09:29] <jrib> SupremacyGnu: now you get a different package?
[09:29] <jerp> drnick, check this out   http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=477953

[09:29] <bach> hello, is anyone able to give some keyboard set-up help.
[09:29] <chuckyp> CientificoLoco, to get a channel list on freenode go to the status window and type /list  or click around in whatever irc program you are using you should be able to find channel list in there.
[09:30] <bordy> Lorddiabolus: Done
[09:30] <jrib> SupremacyGnu: something has gone terribly wrong.  You can try repeating this process but I fear you may be in for a reinstall since you can't really ascertain the full exetent of the damage
[09:30] <fizzman> does any1 know how to setup hotsmtpd?
[09:30] <threeseas> there has got to be a simple way manage remote files (copy delete edit) then a lying gnome-commander, a troubled MC
[09:30] <chuckyp> !patience > fizzman
[09:30] <chuckyp> threeseas, yes there is.
[09:31] <fizzman> chuckyp: ok sorry
[09:31] <SupremacyGnu> jrib, gah, I hoped you wouldn't say that. I just reinstalled to edgy. damn, I could just have skipped trying to install beryl
[09:31] <coffeegrinds> hey I'm not sure exactly what happened but i can't login to gnome right now .. anyone have this issue installing 6.10?
[09:31] <lorddiabolus> now, from each "deb..." line, change http://us.archive.ubuntu to http://archive.ubuntu.  (You're just removing "us." from each line to have everything reroute to the main ubuntu servers)
[09:31] <avagant> SWEET
[09:31] <avagant> coffeegrinds pal buddy
[09:31] <livingdaylight> coffeegrinds, huh?
[09:31] <bordy> I dont have any deb lines... I dont see any lines at all
[09:31] <avagant> what do you mean you can't log in?
[09:31] <bach> my keyboard keys are mixed up i don't know which one I should choose in the keyboard preferences.
[09:31] <clearzen> JamieBE: Still there?
[09:31] <coffeegrinds> avangant..hey hey ..yeah so everything installed but gnome seems to be crippled
[09:32] <JamieBE> ClearZen: Hanging in there. What you got for me dude?
[09:32] <avagant> are you sure everything is installed?
[09:32] <klerfayt> chuckyp: how to cut movie part in two pieces? ffmpeg movie.mp4 --?
[09:32] <avagant> hahaha
[09:32] <SupremacyGnu> jrib, well, thanks for the help. I'll post a forum post before reinstalling
[09:32] <livingdaylight> coffeegrinds, gnome is never crippled
[09:32] <lorddiabolus> bordy:  uh oh, do a CTRL-X to exit, then try again: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:32] <chuckyp> klerfayt, dunno
[09:32] <jrib> SupremacyGnu: np, hope you sort it out
[09:32] <avagant> i had that problem actually right after i updated.
[09:32] <lorddiabolus> bordy: oops, misspelled it the first time
[09:32] <avagant> where it wouldn't recognize my password.
[09:32] <bordy> there they are.
[09:32] <clearzen> JamieBE: Where is ubuntu mounting your media device? What Folder?
[09:32] <coffeegrinds> yeah I'm stuck in failsaif terminal -VNC's to another machine so i canbrowse at least
[09:32] <bordy> now, take out all the .us?
[09:32] <threeseas> thanbks chuckyp
[09:32] <bach> is there a key combination to load terminal
[09:33] <JamieBE> ClearZen: I have no idea. I am suspecting gypsie magic.
[09:33] <clearzen> JamieBE: you said you had access to the mp3 so what folder are they in?
[09:33] <avagant> did you try doing a dist-upgrade again to check and see if everything worked?
[09:33] <lorddiabolus> bordy: yep, make it so it's always http://archive.ubuntu.com...
[09:33] <coolpaul900> Hey what do I do if it has a little square of rubish when I move a folder?
[09:33] <RawSewage> Can someone help me?  Audacity keeps crashing for no reason
[09:33] <jrib> bach: you can set one in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
[09:33] <lorddiabolus> then CTRL-O to save, CTRL-X to quit
[09:33] <chuckyp> bach, ctrl+alt+f1 to get a text terminal
[09:33] <clearzen> JamieBE: lol, magic ubuntu go
[09:33] <coffeegrinds> well thats where I'm stuck now.. everything installed.. but it looks like 6.10 hate me
[09:33] <jrib> RawSewage: do you get any output in the terminal?
[09:33] <|rt|> if I have an existing install of another distro with LVM do I need to backup my lvm files prior to installing ubuntu on the system or will it auto detect the LVM pv's and lv's from the metadata
[09:33] <RawSewage> jrib, just Segmentation Fault
[09:33] <avagant> so you can't check and see even?
[09:33] <bach> cheers
[09:33] <bordy> Lorddiabolus: Just the deb files, not the deb-src files?>
[09:33] <coffeegrinds> all i have is a terminal window
[09:33] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, what is the problem now?
[09:34] <avagant> cause it wouldn't let me run nautilus or anything right after i updated, so i ran dist upgrade and update again.
[09:34] <Music_Shuffle> Question about obtaining the Lame mp3 library. WHere...is it shoved?
[09:34] <avagant> to check and see if everything installed.
[09:34] <lorddiabolus> bordy: do the deb-src files too just in case, but the chances are slim you'll ever need them
[09:34] <bach> chuckyp: ctrl+alt+f1, how do I get back ?
[09:34] <coolpaul900> Hey what do I do if it has a little square of rubish when I move a folder?

[09:34] <ianmacgregor> Music_Shuffle: lame is in multiverse
[09:34] <jrib> RawSewage: well you can check bugs.ubuntu.com and the forums for similar experiences.  If you don't find any you may want to obtain a backtrace and file a bug of your own
[09:34] <chuckyp> bach, ctrl+alt+f7  f1-f6 will be text terminals f7 will be gnome
[09:34] <JamieBE> ClearZen: I am plugging in the USB cable to the MP3 player, opening Gnomad2 and scanning the device from there. Very confusing this whole MTP thing, nothing like conventional mounting of devices and the like. Although I can READ the device info, I cannot WRITE to the device. it just hangs. Maybe it just doesn't work with my MP3 player?
[09:34] <CientificoLoco> coz Amarok order my music the diff. way
[09:34] <avagant> You can get online from the terminal did you know that? And look at website.
[09:35] <coolpaul900> Hey what do I do if it has a little square of rubish when I move a folder?

[09:35] <coffeegrinds> i  was thinking .. one sec..\
[09:35] <cypher1> anyone know about software adapters ?
[09:35] <chun> hi all
[09:35] <avagant> coffeegrinds: Definitley should try to see if everything worked alright with upgrade, that was my problem. It wouldn't recognize my password or run nautilus.
[09:35] <chun> i just got ubuntu 6.10 install, was just wondering what i need to add to the source.list to be able to install wxpython
[09:35] <clearzen> JamieBE: If I had it in front of me I would make it work. But it is hard for me to do that type of thing over irc
[09:35] <avagant> But as soon as I dist-upgrade it was like BAM
[09:35] <JamieBE> ClearZen: A little bird told me that Amarok has MTP support. Would it work with my Creative Zen MicroPhoto?
[09:36] <chuckyp> !info wxpython
[09:36] <ubotu> Package wxpython does not exist in any distro I know
[09:36] <bordy> lorddiabolus: Alright, so the error message is gone, but how do I upgrade from the terminal now? Because my update manager isnt noticing that I need 6.10
[09:36] <clearzen> JamieBE: It should
[09:36] <JamieBE> ClearZen: How to I access a device using Amarok?
[09:36] <chuckyp> chun, what are you looking to install.
[09:36] <lorddiabolus> bordy: if you are trying to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10, try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:36] <avagant> !info lynx
[09:36] <Markive> I tried to update from 5.10 to 6.10 and it didn't work very well, i did a fresh install and that sorted it
[09:36] <ubotu> lynx: Text-mode WWW Browser. In component main, is optional. Version 2.8.5-2ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 1077 kB, installed size 4568 kB
[09:36] <chuckyp> bordy, no
[09:36] <chun> chuckyp: wxpython
[09:36] <tich_> is anyone particularly network savvy?  i've been trying to get my wireless network running since upgrading and i haven't been able to do it.
[09:37] <chuckyp> bordy, make sure dapper is up to date.
[09:37] <avagant> lorddiabolus: Actually try gksu "update-manager -c"
[09:37] <lorddiabolus> bordy: be aware that dist-upgrades to edgy usually don't work all that well
[09:37] <chuckyp> bordy, then just use gksu "update-manager -c"
[09:37] <tich_> i would really appreciate some help.
[09:37] <bordy> Dapper is up to date as far as I know, but I cant find the update for edgy
[09:37] <avagant> bordy: gksu "update-manager -c" is actually the better way to do it.
[09:37] <chuckyp> lorddiabolus, your right you have to use update-manager instead
[09:37] <kitche> bordy: you have to change your source.lst to point to edgy repos
[09:37] <avagant> bordy: It's been deemed "safer"
[09:37] <chuckyp> kitche, no he doesn't
[09:37] <chun> chuckyp: rather, a python script i am trying to use has wxpython as dependency
[09:37] <avagant> that's the hacky way to do it.
[09:38] <chuckyp> bordy, if you use update-manager command you don't have to change your sources.list
[09:38] <avagant> And I hear that's worse then dist-upgrade.
[09:38] <bach> does anyone know what a file with a
[09:38] <avagant> !info swap
[09:38] <ubotu> Package swap does not exist in any distro I know
[09:38] <Markive> don't get me wrong  , it did download like 500meg or so, bet it failed alot on installation
[09:38] <bordy> Well when I check for updates on update managers, all I get is that my system is up to date.
[09:38] <sam11> anyone knows where i can get the hotplug firmware loader?
[09:38] <barnetod> hey guys is there a fairly easy way to add a shared folder from my windows network to ubuntu?
[09:38] <chuckyp> avagant, thats the only way to dist-upgrade is to edit the sources.list but its not the proper way to update
[09:38] <lorddiabolus> chuckyp: his sources.list wasn't working because the us mirror is down YET again...
[09:38] <tcavalo> how can i unistall the shockwave plugin for firefox?
[09:38] <chuckyp> lorddiabolus, its up here.
[09:38] <jrib> tcavalo: uninstall?  you can't install shockwave for linux
[09:39] <avagant> chuckyp: Yah, I hear that's probably not the best way.
[09:39] <Markive> barnetod i can see my samba shares when i open konqueror then it says network places
[09:39] <lorddiabolus> chuckyp: oh well, somehow editing that eliminated his error, so maybe he couldn't reach it for some reason
[09:39] <sam11> anyone knows where I can get the hotplug firmware loader?
[09:39] <avagant> I did gksu "update-manager -c" and it worked fine.
[09:39] <JensB> Hey everybody ... How do I file bugs against the upgrade program that gets downloaded when you upgrade Dapper to Edgy? Or against the live CD? (which "packages" in launchpad.net are they)
[09:39] <avagant> Well actually I lied.
[09:39] <Markive> barnetod or places then network servers
[09:39] <barnetod> let me see if i have konqueror loaded
[09:39] <avagant> It worked fine, until I had 7 minutes left then the update-manager disappeared.
[09:39] <avagant> Then I had to dist-update
[09:39] <overridex-laptop> is there anywork around for the usplash being black and white on amd64 in edgy?
=== fishsticks is now known as fishAFK
[09:39] <barnetod> can i get konq through synaptic?
[09:39] <tcavalo> i can't visit a favorite website due to the shockwave plugin.  it actually shuts down firefox.
[09:40] <chuckyp> avagant, lorddiabolus thats correct doing a dist-upgrade to edgy is not the proper way.  The proper way is to use the update-manager -c
[09:40] <Markive> barnetod yup
[09:40] <Juan____> Hoa
[09:40] <Juan____> Hola I mean
[09:40] <chuckyp> overridex, yeah update your system
[09:40] <maccam94> is it normal for beagled-helper to run with --debug?
[09:40] <barnetod> let me load it then i ask more q's lol
[09:40] <barnetod> :)
[09:40] <lorddiabolus> bordy: got all that? :)
[09:40] <barnetod> ive had ubuntu working 100% for 3 days now
[09:40] <avagant> chuckyp: I only used dist-upgrade after I'd already upgraded to edgy to check and see if everything was alright.
[09:40] <barnetod> so it is finally nice
[09:40] <bordy> Alright, its farther along in the upgrade than normally. lol
[09:40] <Juan____> Does anyone know what is the easiest way to share a dir in ubuntu so that it's reachable from a Mac ?
[09:40] <avagant> My only problem with edgy so far is xmms is crash-o-matic.
[09:40] <Markive> barnetod its says remote:/ when i hover over network folders on konq
[09:41] <maccam94> Juan____: NFS
[09:41] <maccam94> er
[09:41] <maccam94> Samba is actually easier
[09:41] <Juan____> I've tried NFS but the Mac keeps asking me for the server
[09:41] <lorddiabolus> avag, chuky: I haven't played with update-manager all that much, I'm from the old-skool debian style lol
[09:41] <maccam94> but i use nfs
[09:41] <barnetod> markive one question
[09:41] <Markive> dosn't take long to gete everything sorted
[09:41] <maccam94> Juan____: i load it from the command line
[09:41] <barnetod> do i need to load the plugins too?
[09:41] <Juan____> maccam94: How ?
[09:41] <avagant> And I didn't have a swap partition which was stupid of me, so everything was freezing up and taking forever to load.
[09:41] <avagant> But now smooth sailing for 2 days.
[09:41] <Markive> barnetod plugins? na, just make sure your other machines with the shared folders are on and shared
[09:42] <Markive> i have 5 machines here on xp and i can browse all of them
[09:42] <avagant> xmms doesn't worry me too much because i've discovered rhythmbox
[09:42] <coffeegrinds> hmm.. well sir i think it;s broken
[09:42] <barnetod> you know i never thought i would say it even being a ubuntu newb
[09:42] <avagant> coffeegrinds :(
[09:42] <barnetod> but setting up printing and networking (stable networking) is so much easier than windows 2003
[09:42] <barnetod> server
[09:42] <Markive> i'm a n00b aswell barnetod
[09:42] <maccam94> Juan____: sudo mount -t nfs -o -P host:/home/user/share /Users/username/emptyfolder
[09:42] <jerp> I'd like to know how to get alacart menu editor to open in edgy (or if it's even there at all)
[09:42] <avagant> did you try dist-upgrade? or perhaps loading gnome-desktop or anything of that sort.
[09:42] <Streak> booobies?
[09:43] <Markive> MMMM
[09:43] <lorddiabolus> streak, you have my attention! LOL

[09:43] <Markive> nope never heard of it
[09:43] <JamieBE> ClearZen: I off to bed now
[09:43] <mluser-home> Does anyone know where I can get the Flash 9 plugin for ubuntu?
[09:43] <maccam94> Juan____: use the full path on the server, like /media/name or /home/user/blah
[09:43] <barnetod> look up XGL on youtube
[09:43] <jrib> !flash9 | mluser-home
[09:43] <ubotu> mluser-home: Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[09:43] <barnetod> really cool desktop features of linux
[09:43] <Markive> SWScanner is my app of the week
[09:43] <rem__> hey..did I overlook something or is there still no way to enter a user/pass for the proxy settings to install packages in graphic mode .. ? this started with dapper and doesnt seem to be updated in edgy -?!
[09:43] <mluser-home> thanks
[09:43] <avagant> Wait i'm confused now, coffeegrinds.
[09:43] <lorddiabolus> I'm off everyone, my Lions are actually winning... can't miss this... bye
[09:43] <avagant> hahaha
[09:43] <maccam94> mluser-home: Automatix does it too
[09:43] <hanasaki> what do i reconfigure to select new languages?
[09:43] <Juan____> maccam94: Ok. A microsecond...
[09:43] <jerp> mluser, mmm, adobe?
[09:44] <avagant> yah the netboot ubuntu server for usa by the way is crap.
[09:44] <barnetod> it any good?
[09:44] <bach> hello, do you know what ~after a filename means?
[09:44] <avagant> i had to get my ubuntu download from the uk in order to get one to work.
[09:44] <barnetod> im using network manager
[09:44] <kitche> bach: it's a backup copy
[09:44] <rem__> of course apt-get works...but wonder why this hasnt been corrected ... ?
[09:44] <maccam94> bach: it's a temporary file usually
[09:44] <barnetod> which was hard enough to get wireless working in ubuntu
[09:44] <Markive> handy program, perfect for wardriving
[09:44] <mluser-home> maccam94: Automatix?
[09:44] <Markive> my 2200b/g went ok
[09:45] <Markive> just a bit of fiddling
[09:45] <finalbeta> Does google Picasa have a linux version?
[09:45] <bach> seems that i have two files in my directory with this on I have deleted the original file of one can I just delete them ?
[09:45] <avagant> instulux is actually really awesome for anyone that has windows, it just takes 9 years to download and install everything.
[09:45] <barnetod> dude awesome
[09:45] <avagant> 9 years is an exaggeration of course.
[09:45] <barnetod> konqueror rules
[09:45] <barnetod> lol
[09:45] <jrib> finalbeta: did you try googling for "google picasa linux version" ? :)
[09:45] <malte`> finalbeta: yes, but it sucks. use f-spt
[09:45] <barnetod> already popped up and running
[09:45] <avagant> I should have tried opensuse though.
[09:46] <Markive> http://www.google.com/linux
[09:46] <finalbeta> f-spot s**** 2 :p
[09:46] <chuckyp> avagant, what is instalux?
[09:46] <avagant> chuckyp: It's for someone who doesn't have a cddrive that works or a floppy drive.
[09:46] <barnetod> i need to check google linux out :)
[09:47] <chuckyp> avagant, oh you're talking about a network install
[09:47] <avagant> basically it sets up grub and everything for you in windows, you restart and it takes you through the installation process over the net.
[09:47] <knix> barnetod: that's just a linux filtered search =P
[09:47] <jStefan> Markive, that website will not list ubuntu website as 1st result when searching for "ubuntu" :(
[09:47] <Markive> lol
[09:47] <avagant> chuckyp: Yah, I didn't realize you could do that until the other day.
[09:47] <barnetod> i know knix
[09:47] <Markive> really?
[09:47] <jStefan> Markive, regular google will
[09:47] <knix> barnetod: google.com/bsd =)
[09:47] <barnetod> lol but i need all the help i can get :)
[09:47] <avagant> Because my cd drive sucks alot.
[09:47] <coffeegrinds> dist-upgrade has nothing for me..
[09:47] <avagant> Hmmm.
[09:47] <knix> barnetod: hehe
[09:47] <chuckyp> avagant, yeah that was the way it was done back in the day.
[09:47] <Streak> i have a ques .. does any 1 know what parts make up the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and how are they related to sleep ???
[09:47] <avagant> Did you check and make sure you actually have gdm or xserver, coffee?
[09:48] <Markive> i think http://www.google.com/linux is more geeky techinal old stuff
[09:48] <hanasaki> how do i add a new locale?
[09:48] <barnetod> knix although i am new i had a nice little break in with setting up opengl and wireless
[09:48] <DrNick_> I wonder if anyone could briefly explain what the situation regarding firewall's is with ubuntu? I've heard that the system is closed by default or something so it doesn't need one. however when using ubuntu server i've still had to configure iptables, so what about desktop?
[09:48] <avagant> coffeegrinds: Check and see if you have gdm gnome-desktop or xserver.
[09:48] <chuckyp> barnetod, help.ubuntu.com  read the desktop guide or poke around.
[09:48] <Markive> or wiki
[09:48] <Ayabara> how can I get firefox to use mozilla-mplayer? it seems it only wants to use totem
[09:48] <Markive> wiki has tons
[09:48] <avagant> chuckyp: It took forever though.
[09:48] <chuckyp> barnetod, also if you search for ubuntuguide  there is another good site that will walk you through doing most stuff.
[09:48] <barnetod> chucky thats my first bookmark hahaha
[09:48] <knix> barnetod: it's cake on ubuntu =P, well wireless anyway
[09:48] <avagant> chuckyp: I couldn't even get my Edgy disc to work.
[09:48] <coffeegrinds> I'm gonna try apt-getting kubuntu so i can see if i can at least login to Kde
[09:48] <chuckyp> avagant, yeah depends on your connection.
[09:48] <Flannel> Streak: this is #ubuntu, that'd be a question for #ubuntu-offtopic
[09:48] <barnetod> knix not with an intel 3945abg
[09:48] <barnetod> lol
[09:49] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, If you would explain your problem perhaps we could help you.
[09:49] <barnetod> and a nice broadcom unsupported
[09:49] <knix> barnetod: yes, you just need to install the restricted-modules package
[09:49] <kitche> DrNick_: well everything is closed by default so you can't connect to the machine but you can get out traffice
[09:49] <Arcad3> by  Webhosting can u earn  money in a decent way?
[09:49] <mepa|Yancho> where is the file which has the info of the network connections psl ?
[09:49] <avagant> chuckyp: He can't log into Gnome at all.
[09:49] <knix> barnetod: that's what I'm using right now =)
[09:49] <avagant> chuckyp: He's on a black screen with a terminal.
[09:49] <Streak> I HAVE A QUES... does any 1 know what parts make up the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and how are they related to sleep ???
[09:49] <Markive> ayabara find a file with the same extension save to you desktop, right click on it, then opens with.. change it to your app of choice
[09:49] <Flannel> Streak: this is #ubuntu, that'd be a question for #ubuntu-offtopic
[09:49] <Arcad3> whats yours opinion?
[09:49] <Ayabara> Markive: thanks
[09:49] <DrNick_> kitche, ok, well what if you want to run a server package on the desktop install then? would you have to reconfigure iptables by hand like for the server distro?
[09:49] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, well pick the non recovermode from the grub list.  Then log in to gnome.
[09:50] <Markive> :)
[09:50] <coffeegrinds> chuckyp well both the install disk and my now broken upgrade to 6.10 from 6.06 seems to constantly be restarting my X session after I log in..
[09:50] <Streak> what is the rapid eye movement?
[09:50] <avagant> Yah get one of the desktops and see if it's that, I've heard there's been alot of x-server problems with edgy and certain hardware.
[09:50] <Flannel> !offtopic | Streak
[09:50] <ubotu> Streak: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[09:50] <kitche> DrNick_: you owuld just have to edit /etc/host.allow and host.deny that I know of
[09:50] <barnetod> lol knix
[09:50] <Lone> Is there a way to create a shortcut to something via the GUI?
[09:50] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, what type of video card?
[09:50] <barnetod> how did you get it so easily
[09:50] <dax> When I go to 'Sessions', and add startup programs, and X out then re-open, they aren't there.  They aren't saving.  Anyone know a solution?
[09:50] <avagant> did you check your x session settings, cofee?
[09:50] <chuckyp> Lone, yes
[09:50] <Streak> i need help though
[09:50] <barnetod> i got lucky and found a ubuntu forum guide that actually worked :)
[09:50] <Streak> plzz help
[09:50] <Streak> y:(
[09:50] <chuckyp> Lone, a desktop shortcut or a menu shortcut?
[09:50] <DrNick_> kitche, okies, cheers.
[09:51] <kitche> dax: are you saving the session when you log out?
[09:51] <avagant> The only real difference with edgy and dapper is edgy is brighter.
[09:51] <Flannel> Streak: Ask in the correct places to get help, this is not #biology or anything else
[09:51] <coffeegrinds> chuckyp, tried loads up to a point then i end up back at my login screen
[09:51] <coolpaul900> How do I get rid of this square of wierd stuff when I move a folder with my mouse?
[09:51] <avagant> oh nossssss.
[09:51] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, well what type of video card?
[09:51] <dax> kitche, how do I do that?
[09:51] <coffeegrinds> the only session that works right now is failsaif terminal
[09:51] <Streak> flannel this not a bio ques it is a psychology ques
[09:51] <avagant> chuckyp: I feel terrible because I'm the one that encouraged him to update. Haha
[09:51] <coffeegrinds> hehehe voodoo 3
[09:51] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, also have you checked /var/log/Xorg.0.old for error messages
[09:51] <avagant> coffeegrinds: FOR FREE
[09:51] <kitche> dax: when you log out of your window manager there should be a checkbox that says save session
[09:52] <Flannel> Streak: it doesn't matter, it's not an ubuntu question, and doesn't belong in #ubuntu. You could try #ubuntu-offtopic, or any other relevant channel
[09:52] <ExilE> I tried edgy today and all i can say is I went back to dapper, my mouse wouldn't even work in edgy when it runs fine in dapper
[09:52] <Streak> does any1 know the mathematics of quatum mechanics?
[09:52] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, okay are you able to start the system in recover mode and log in so you atleast have a text terminal?
[09:52] <dax> kitche, oh yes, I have that checked.
[09:52] <Streak> plzz help
[09:52] <coolpaul900> How do I get rid of this square of wierd stuff when I move a folder with my mouse?
[09:52] <barnetod> hey when using wine do i just open the file or do i need to load something in the terminal?
[09:52] <coffeegrinds> chuckyp yeah..
[09:52] <barnetod> streak what you need?
[09:52] <bulmer> when installing Ubuntu live cd on a laptop, the display is rather small, how do I tell it to take the full screen on boot?
[09:52] <avagant> Man am I glad I discovered the magic of swap partitions, whew.
[09:52] <Markive> coolpaul900 try right clicking near it so a menu box goes over it
[09:52] <mepa|Yancho> where is the file which has the info of the network connections please?
[09:52] <coffeegrinds> right now 've got that terminal getting Kubuntu-desktop
[09:53] <kitche> barnetod: you have to do wine /path/to/<program>.exe
[09:53] <Markive> type ifconfig in terminal
[09:53] <Kingsqueak> mepa|Yancho /etc/network/
[09:53] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, okay well first lets sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf   and check out the Driver section
[09:53] <coolpaul900> That does not help
[09:53] <barnetod> okay
[09:53] <mepa|Yancho> thanks Kingsqueak
[09:53] <ixian_> barnetod, you can usually just double click on the exe file
[09:53] <Lone> chuckyp: a desktop shortcut
[09:53] <coolpaul900> that is not what I am talking about
[09:53] <barnetod> i hope ixian :)
[09:53] <coffeegrinds> can't .. I'm at51%
[09:53] <chuckyp> Lone, to an application or a file?
[09:53] <avagant> chuckyp: Take it away, I caused this mess for him. Haha
[09:53] <Kingsqueak> mepa|Yancho 'interfaces' is the main one, but don't overlook the others
[09:53] <tich_> i need some help setting up a wireless connection, could anyone help?
[09:53] <ixian_> barnetod, unless you have to give the exe file some paramaters, then you'd have to do it in a console
[09:53] <Lone> chuckyp: to my home folder, so i don't have to go through the menus to get to it
[09:53] <coffeegrinds> heheh
[09:53] <Markive> tich_ whats up
[09:54] <coffeegrinds> s'all good
[09:54] <mepa|Yancho> thanks Kingsqueak and if i replace static with dhcp it means it will get the ip from the dhcp right ?
[09:54] <barnetod> okay
[09:54] <barnetod> easy enough
[09:54] <avagant> I'm hungry, like....whoa.
[09:54] <coffeegrinds> 60%
[09:54] <frank23> I'm having a strange issue: In kubuntu dapper, I'm running firefox 1.5 and mythtranscode at the same time. mythtranscode uses up all my CPU. when mythtranscode runs at nice=19, firefox is responsive and working fine. when mythtranscode runs at nice=17 (the default), firefox is so slow it's not usable. All the other programs run fine. Any ideas?
[09:54] <Kingsqueak> mepa|Yancho yeah basically, 'man interfaces'  I think, explains it
[09:54] <chuckyp> Lone, well sudo gconf-editor and under apps>nautilus > desktop  you can check box to make your home folder visible on the desktop
[09:54] <Markive> tich_ click system then networking
[09:54] <Lone> wow thanks
[09:54] <Pablo> on my laptop.. is there anyway to move the scroll part on the right of the touchpad to the left of the touchpad?
[09:54] <barnetod> i have a lot of lynda.com guides that i want to view through linux maybe it wont require wine
[09:54] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, 60% of what?
[09:54] <coolpaul900> I mean when I click on the program or folder it comes up with this weird square with rubbish
[09:54] <Markive> system > admin> networking
[09:55] <DrNick_> I have to say, after using Fedora for over a year, I much prefer Debian based distro's such as Ubuntu.
[09:55] <tich_> Markive,  i have my wireless set up through networking
[09:55] <coffeegrinds> my apt-get is at well 70% now
[09:55] <EwaKezman> hi
[09:55] <tich_> Markive,  and wifi radar shows the essid and signal
[09:55] <chuckyp> coffeegrinds, ahhh
[09:55] <Lone> chuckyp: wow, thanks
[09:55] <tich_> Markive, but i can never get an ip address
[09:55] <coolpaul900> I mean when I click on the program or folder it comes up with this weird square with rubbish
[09:55] <Markive> i found that if i use both wifi managers it gets a paddy on
[09:55] <ExilE> tich_ try network manager it seemed to work better for me
[09:56] <Markive> sorted out all the wepcode etc tich_
[09:56] <coolpaul900> I mean when I click on the program or folder it comes up with this weird square with rubbish in it how do I get rid of it?
[09:56] <tich_> ExilE, i have been planning on it but i thought i should be able to connect manually before going automated
[09:57] <chuckyp> Lone, we just did it that way because its possible with gnome but to answer your question normally like if you wanted to create a shortcut for something obscure.  Right click on desktop and create launher.
[09:57] <barnetod> have the right drivers coolpaul?
[09:57] <erUSUL> Have anybody experienced problems with entries in the System>Admin> menu no longer working e.g. thet do not ask for password and simply said that you do not have enough perms and quit??
[09:57] <ExilE> network manager sorted it all out no hassle
[09:57] <Lone> chuckyp: that works thanks
[09:57] <barnetod> i know i had a screen one inch by one inch i had to navigate during the trials of loading nvidia drivers
[09:57] <coolpaul900> Can someone help?
[09:57] <chuckyp> erUSUL, are you logged in a guest account or the regular user.
[09:57] <tich_> Markive, i don't get what you mean by 'sorted out all the webcode"
[09:57] <chuckyp> Lone, np
[09:57] <Markive> coolpaul900 sounds like the menu is in a foreign langusge or font or something
[09:57] <Kingsqueak> holy hell, NetBSD doesn't even install perl in base
[09:58] <DrNick_> which server would you think would run freeNX services better, a single-core P4 @ 2.8Ghz, or a quad Xeon @ 550Mhz each system?
[09:58] <coolpaul900> No no that is not the case
[09:58] <Markive> tich_ have you put the wepcode for the ssid your trying to connect to?
[09:58] <coolpaul900> it is a block of almost like a bar code
[09:58] <Juan____> maccam94: Thank you. It works without problems !
[09:58] <erUSUL> chuckyp: i know i have perms becouse if i edit the menus and add gksu to the entry it works (and some entries that do have gksu still work). But i know that in a fresh install the gksu shouldn't be necessary
[09:59] <sundari> can some one point me to guide to make the back button work on a logitech mouse?
[09:59] <Lone> chuckyp: i did what you told me to do with the sudo gconf-editor or w/e and i went to apps->nautilus->desktop and check the box for home folder but nothing appeared on my desktop
[09:59] <chuckyp> coolpaul900, perhaps you have corrupt video memory then?  Or you need to switch video drivers.
[09:59] <sam11> DrNick, what is freeNX
[09:59] <Bane> I'm trying to setup ubuntu on a older box with a wireless card, I'm checking out the wiki troubleshooting and I have a question about the wiki
[09:59] <coolpaul900> how do I do that?
[09:59] <eva_> Hi
[09:59] <tich_> Markive, yep i've inputted my essid and am connecting using dhcp (no wep)
[09:59] <DrNick_> sam11, remote X basically.
[09:59] <chuckyp> erUSUL, well permissions to edit menus is different then running the applications listed there.  Any user can edit their own menus.
[09:59] <chuckyp> Lone, try restarting X  with ctrl+alt+backspace
[09:59] <sam11> i think it all depends on the bandwidth, not how fast the cpu is
[10:00] <Markive> tich_ hmm thats wierd, mine jumps on other networks if there is no wepcode on them just like that... hmm
[10:00] <coolpaul900> how would I change the video drive?
[10:00] <DrNick_> well bandwidth wise they'd both be the same
[10:00] <Bane> "If you see your card in the list try to set the properties and activate."  If I go into System/netowrking, I see a entry for wireless connection, but it doesn't specifically list my wiress card model, is that normal?
[10:00] <Markive> tich_ have you made sure your adjusting the settings for the right adapter?
[10:00] <jwilliams> Hello all.  I am trying to connect to a Windows share using Nautilus and am being prompted for a username, workgroup and password.  Is there any way I can change the default values for username and workgroup permanently?
[10:00] <Markive> go into terminal and type ifconfig
[10:00] <chuckyp> Lone, also make sure you are runing gconf-editor as root with "sudo gconf-editor"  no qoutes of course.
[10:00] <coffeegrinds> almost there'
[10:00] <DrNick_> also the quad xeon server is on Ultra SCSI 160, whereas the P4 server is only ATA RAID
[10:00] <Markive> it will tell you the eth01 eth2
[10:00] <chuckyp> coolpaul900, what type of video card do you have?
[10:00] <Markive> etc
[10:01] <Kingsqueak> jwilliams you can 'bookmark' it and I believe it saves the login if you choose
[10:01] <jwilliams> PS: I have been googling on this for ages ...
[10:01] <sundari> how to get backbutton work on a logitech?
[10:01] <coolpaul900> I don't know
[10:01] <Bane> Markive: was that directed at me?
[10:01] <jwilliams> Kingsqueak: thanks, but it doesn't :-(
[10:01] <Markive> jwilliams or lower the securtiy on the windows machine
[10:01] <tich_> Markive, okay, that is done
[10:01] <coolpaul900> I think it has like 6 mb of memory
[10:01] <Ropechoborra> !video
[10:01] <ubotu> For multimedia codecs see: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html and for applications see this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaApplications
[10:01] <jwilliams> Markive: I am not the admin on the windows machine
[10:02] <Markive> hmm
[10:02] <chuckyp> coolpaul900, alright well how about taking a screenshot so I can see what you are talking aobut.  You can upload it to.  www.imageshack.us  and it will give you a link
[10:02] <sam11> i know that for a server the cpu doesn't have be really fast in Mhz, but it's the throughput, so a p3 might even be faster in those kind of things
[10:02] <tich_> Markive, it came up with etho, ath0, lo and wifi0
[10:02] <Yaakov> jwilliams: Use smbmount instead of the GUI.
[10:02] <erUSUL> chuckyp: i'm spanish so i must have not explained it well. if i do gksudo time-admin i can chang date and time if i do rightclick in the clock or i use the system>Admin>date and time it fails
[10:02] <Markive> tich_ what eth is next to your wireless card in the list
[10:02] <Kingsqueak> jwilliams well you could add it to fstab and put the user:pass in the mount command, but it's not the most secure solution
[10:02] <bluefox83> ok..i have a fun question... i would like to have /home/bluefox point to /dev/hda2 instead of it's current partition (/dev/hda5) how can i do that without massively destroying and losing everything?
[10:02] <Yaakov> jwilliams: man smbmount
[10:02] <sam11> a p3 mp system
[10:02] <JDStone> tich_: you have an atheros chipset, huh?
[10:02] <jwilliams> Yaakov: I used to do that, but it caused problems when network connectivity is intermittent
[10:02] <chuckyp> erUSUL, hrm...  I would make sure you user is in the sudoers file.
[10:02] <DrNick_> sam11, well it will have to run everyone's applications though.  a file server doesn't need much CPU, however an apps server would do.  in essence what i'm asking is, would more Mhz be better than more CPU's
=== fishAFK is now known as fishsticks
[10:03] <chuckyp> erUSUL, perhaps you may also want to try the spanish support.
[10:03] <chuckyp> !es
[10:03] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[10:03] <Yaakov> jwilliams: put it in fstab.
[10:03] <Kingsqueak> just set it to noauto
[10:03] <tich_> JDStone, yeah it is atheros
[10:03] <jwilliams> Kingsqueak: mounting the share permanently is not an option with intermittent network connectivity
[10:03] <Markive> i'm not sure then
[10:03] <JDStone> tich_: ahh
[10:03] <chuckyp> bluefox83, you mean you want your /home moved to a serperate partition?
[10:03] <bluefox83> chuckyp, yes
[10:03] <gumpish> AfroDuck: w00t
[10:04] <sam11> if there is only one user using your server then defintely the p4 is the winner
[10:04] <chuckyp> bluefox83, follow these instructions http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
[10:04] <DrNick_> sam11, well no, there will be 6 - 10 users.
[10:04] <DrNick_> thats the whole point lol
[10:04] <chuckyp> bluefox83, except you don't need to resize your parition since you already have one set up for it.
[10:04] <tich_> Markive, i don't think i can find the info you requested-- what is it that you wnat?
[10:05] <DrNick_> but I'm thinking that 4 xeon CPU's will be able to handle a lot more than a single P4 CPU, even if they are slower in Mhz.
[10:05] <DrNick_> it has more RAM as well, and better disks.  so I guess I've answered my own question really lol
[10:05] <Ropechoborra> If i wanna install two or more packets how can i do in only one command line ? Like: sudo apt-get install packer1,packet2 like that??
[10:05] <kitche> DrNick_: Xeon's are more powerful then a P4
[10:05] <tich_> JDStone, does atheros mean something to you?
[10:05] <SupremacyGnu> Is there someway you can restore all configuration and programs to default without deleting my most important files?
[10:05] <chuckyp> Ropechoborra, sudo apt-get install package1 package2
[10:06] <Markive> tich_ to make sure that your ubuntu is trying to use wifi01 for to go out on the network or if its still on lo or eth0
[10:06] <DrNick_> kitche, yeah, but these are only 550Mhz Xeon's.  I still think 4 of them will outperform a P4 tho
[10:06] <Ropechoborra> Ok thanks
[10:06] <JDStone> tich_: I have a friend with an atheros chipset
[10:06] <chris_> Atheros is a wireless chipset
[10:06] <chuckyp> SupremacyGnu, for all programs or just one?
[10:06] <DrNick_> tich_, I remember artheros :)
[10:06] <sam11> DrNick, I think you're right
[10:06] <DrNick_> artheros was the predecessor of RISC-OS
[10:06] <coffeegrinds> DrNick.. I envy the quad xeon...
[10:06] <chuckyp> SupremacyGnu, wait you want to bring your system to the point of a fresh install?  Like removing all added programs and stuff?
[10:06] <josh__> is there a linux tool that has the ability to interact with the windows cmd.exe application?
[10:07] <DrNick_> coffeegrinds, lol, its a server at work, so Its not mine ;)
[10:07] <chuckyp> josh__, what do you mean in windows ?
[10:07] <coffeegrinds> who cares how old
[10:07] <josh__> yeah
[10:07] <SupremacyGnu> chuckyp, yes, but I don't want to remove my files in my .wine folder and some folders in my home folder
[10:07] <bulmer> josh_ SFU on xp and 2003
[10:07] <chuckyp> josh__, well if you are talking about getting some linux shell commands in windows there are several options.
[10:07] <josh__> coffeegrinds: im getting one of those in like 3 days :)
[10:07] <nehoksan> FTSZ,
[10:07] <nehoksan> GNAA > Ubuntu
[10:07] <DrNick_> coffeegrinds, its still a pretty beasty system though, 1Gb RAM, 6 x Ultra SCSI disks, so it still does the job.
[10:08] <coffeegrinds> chuckyp .. just got K we'll see what happens
[10:08] <chuckyp> josh__, but if you mean using dos commands in nix you are sol.  but you can run some windows apps with wine.
[10:08] <josh__> bulmer: yeah i have those... im talking linux to windows
[10:08] <tich_> Markive, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30321/

[10:08] <abnerian> Hey, what's a window manager that is good for a laptop?
[10:08] <chuckyp> SupremacyGnu, well you could always move /home to its own parition.  THen reinstall nix or whatever and tell it to use the /home on the other parition.
[10:08] <abnerian> One I could drive entirely via keyboar.d
[10:08] <bulmer> josh__: what are you trying to achieve?
[10:08] <abnerian> *Keyboard.

[10:09] <chuckyp> SupremacyGnu, http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
[10:09] <abnerian> Is it hard to set up?
[10:09] <Kingsqueak> abnerian you can setup your own hotkeys for anything you want

[10:09] <SupremacyGnu> chuckyp, ok, thanks. I'll check it out
[10:09] <teclo> Hi there, since I upgraded to edgy, sensors stopped working. /dev/i2c-* is there as well as /sys ... what can I do ?

[10:10] <teclo> chuckyp: Pentium 4
[10:10] <barnetod> i like beryl
[10:10] <sam11> DrNick, I think it depends on the cache size, even you have a p4 system, if it has to do swapping all the time because of inadequate ram/small cache, a
[10:10] <barnetod> pretty neat

[10:10] <Kingsqueak> abnerian running Beryl on a Dell 820, it's been great
[10:10] <barnetod> makes multitasking easy without having ten million monitors
[10:10] <abnerian> That was EXACTLY what I was looking for
[10:10] <teclo> chuckyp: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz
[10:10] <SupremacyGnu> chuckyp, but the thing is. that I already have a home partition... can I then remove my other partition and keep everything on my home partition and then use it with my fresh install?
[10:10] <coolpaul900> chuckyp, It won't let me take it well I am moving a file
[10:10] <chuckyp> teclo, install linux-image-generic  will get you a more specific kernel for your cpu.  Should also fix your sensors
[10:10] <barnetod> king i run it on a E1505
[10:10] <josh__> bulmer: im wanting to run netsh commands
[10:10] <barnetod> abnerian what video card you have?
[10:10] <abnerian> So, Compiz actually makes it efficient?
[10:10] <josh__> remote into my wifes comp and make all my network changes through commandline
[10:10] <Coffeegrinds> avangant... I"M IN!
[10:10] <abnerian> radeon 9700 mobility
[10:10] <Kingsqueak> beryl is awfully sketchy on Edgy amd64 though unfortunately or I'd have it on this box now
[10:11] <teclo> chuckyp: yes but, I will be running a different kernel then ?
[10:11] <Kingsqueak> too shaky to use
[10:11] <barnetod> have ati drivers loaded already?
[10:11] <abnerian> I'm on Dapper AMD64.
[10:11] <abnerian> I'm not sure.
[10:11] <abnerian> how do I find out?
[10:11] <chuckyp> SupremacyGnu, if you have a seperate /home parition then You just remove the / parition and reinstall whatever during the install youc an tell it to use the /dev/hda5 or whatever as your /home and all your files will still be there.
[10:11] <Yaakov> Arcad3:   (unicode)
[10:11] <bulmer> josh_ maybe VNC will do it for you..run it on windows and access it from linux
[10:11] <Kingsqueak> abnerian the only way to know is to try and install/config it
[10:11] <abnerian> Is it easy to uninstall?
[10:11] <abnerian> See
[10:11] <barnetod> ubuntuguide.org abnerian
[10:11] <Kingsqueak> abnerian I'm on beta NVidia drivers
[10:11] <josh__> yeah... its just that vnc has so much network overhead...
[10:11] <chuckyp> teclo, well same version of the kernel but one that is built for your cpu..
[10:12] <coolpaul900> chuckyp, It won't let me take it well I am moving a file
[10:12] <tich_> Markive, was the pastebin stuff helpful?
[10:12] <Kingsqueak> abnerian basically yeah, you just disable it in the configs and restart X
[10:12] <barnetod> i only have tried nvidia beta drivers ab
[10:12] <josh__> im thinking i might just get cygwin
[10:12] <abnerian> I want a way to switch quickly between Fluxbox and Compiz.
[10:12] <josh__> then i can use ssh and now have all the graphical overhead
[10:12] <bulmer> How do I get Ubuntu live CD to use the full screen on a laptop? i only get the cropped squarish display in the middle.
[10:12] <boink> rdesktop works fine too
[10:12] <abnerian> So when I'm out, I can use ion/Fluxbox
[10:12] <Kingsqueak> abnerian you set them up as sessions in gdm, then you can log out and in again with a different session
[10:12] <josh__> bulmer: change your xorg.conf file
[10:13] <Kingsqueak> abnerian fluxbox doesn't work with compiz or beryl afaik
[10:13] <abnerian> may I PM you? I'm really new at this.
[10:13] <abnerian> What about Ion?
[10:13] <bruenig> !msg
[10:13] <ubotu> Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[10:13] <barnetod> bulmer i had to change default depth in my xorg file
[10:13] <bulmer> josh_ where do I change that since it is a live CD?
[10:13] <barnetod> from 16 to 24
[10:13] <josh__> oh... lol good point
[10:13] <nolimitsoya> whats tha command for mounting every device in fstab?
[10:13] <josh__> hmm
[10:13] <SupremacyGnu> chuckyp, ok, that's great. But will I have to remove programs like firefox and reinstall it? I do understand that I have to reinstall programs which need files from my / partition.
[10:13] <nolimitsoya> *the
[10:13] <Coffeegrinds> chuckyp I'm not sure whats going on here then.. I just installed Kubuntu-desktop and seems that I'm in.. no   hiccups at all..  GNome wants to be a burden right now though
[10:13] <Kingsqueak> abnerian ion would be the same thing, if you install it, it will be added as a session in gdm, you can just pick it to try it out
[10:13] <josh__> mount -a
[10:13] <barnetod> josh i was able to on the live cd
[10:13] <boink> nolimitosya: mount -a

[10:13] <barnetod> well via the live cd
[10:13] <nolimitsoya> josh__, thank you :)
[10:13] <abnerian> I...uh. Don't know what GDM is, XD
[10:13] <bruenig> !gdm
[10:13] <ubotu> gdm: GNOME Display Manager. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 1686 kB, installed size 12300 kB
[10:13] <Kingsqueak> abnerian I'm leaving soon to go to the movies (Borat) and I'm building a system here so I can't go into all the details
[10:14] <abnerian> alright
[10:14] <uboot> workspaces doesn't show program's icons
[10:14] <Kingsqueak> abnerian gdm is the graphical login screen
[10:14] <bulmer> barnetod: how did you do that? which directory you go to modify a config file?
[10:14] <bruenig> borat, very nice
[10:14] <abnerian> Aha. And I could login to both Beryl and Ion?
=== DeadFragment is now known as Moshpitlife_Rep
[10:14] <josh__> kdm will be..... kde display manager
[10:14] <abnerian> If I set both up?
[10:14] <Kingsqueak> abnerian yeah you could switch between them
[10:14] <Kingsqueak> abnerian log out of one, and back in with another
[10:14] <abnerian> Where could I find a guide on this? I really appreciate the help.
[10:14] <barnetod> let me try and remember
[10:15] <barnetod> what can you navigate now?
[10:15] <Kingsqueak> abnerian try  'apt-get install fluxbox' then in gdm, click on Session at the lower left
[10:15] <Kingsqueak> abnerian you'll see it gets added
[10:15] <abnerian> Just log out from GNOME, and log back in under whatever?
[10:15] <Kingsqueak> abnerian yup
[10:15] <abnerian> Do Ion and Compiz play nicely?
[10:15] <Kingsqueak> no idea
[10:15] <abnerian> Compiz for home,Ion for away.
[10:16] <Kingsqueak> you know you can run compiz with keys too most likely
[10:16] <Kingsqueak> you look into that yet?
[10:16] <bulmer> barnetod: me? i can navigate to all the directories accessable, but dont know where that xorg.conf is at..
[10:16] <abnerian> Yeah, but it eats up resources.
[10:16] <Kingsqueak> true
[10:16] <Coffeegrinds> well I'm good now I gotta run  and start cleaning my house before my girl gets home from work.. thanks for the ideas chuckp / vangant

[10:18] <threeseas> there has got to be an easy way to remotely maintain files

[10:20] <abnerian> No
[10:20] <abnerian> The contact page
[10:20] <soumyadc> why?
[10:20] <abnerian> It's Last Measure
[10:20] <nehoksan> why should the GNAA do that to you?
[10:21] <soumyadc> picasa: will it work properly on 5.10
[10:21] <abnerian> The GNAA likes to troll
[10:21] <DrNick_> nope contact page works fine too
[10:21] <abnerian> be careful roaming about their wbsite
[10:21] <abnerian> Huh
[10:21] <nehoksan> no, they are nice, polite poeple
[10:21] <abnerian> What page was it, then

[10:22] <josh__> lol
[10:22] <josh__> i guess clicking the site screwed them up after all
[10:22] <Comrade_S> anyone know a good iso editor?
[10:22] <threeseas> its funny that to use ssh tech without a password is ....silly
[10:22] <nehoksan> maybe they were gay niggers

[10:23] <DrNick_> wb Coffeegrinds
[10:23] <Coffeegrinds> ty
[10:23] <fredl> anybody has any idea why my SSH server keeps asking me for my password when I ssh in as root, even though I have added my ssh key in .ssh/authorized_keys?
[10:23] <ifireball> threeseas: 1024bit encryption key is more secure then a password
[10:23] <Coffeegrinds> just wish i wasn't having this problem
[10:24] <threeseas> sshfs uses 1024but encryption?
[10:24] <josh__> that depends?
[10:24] <josh__> where do you live?
=== Moshpitlife_Rep is now known as Rawr
[10:24] <DrNick_> fredl, dunno if you need to change anything in the config file? authentication method or anything?
[10:25] <poekert> does anybody know how to get Gaim bonjour working with avahi in edgy?
[10:25] <fredl> DrNick_, yeah that's what I figured since Ubuntu is so picky about logging in as root.....
[10:25] <ifireball> threeseas: no idea, but if it needs to hake password-less ssh connection an encryption key is the way (man ssh-keygen for details)
[10:25] <Bane> if I do a sudo iwconfig, should my wireless adapter show up as eth0?
[10:25] <Coffeegrinds> ever since i started with 6.10  when I load Gnome or a  gnome app. X restarts and puts me back at login. I've had to install Kubuntu-desktop to even make it this gfar
[10:25] <DrNick_> fredl, you have enabled the root user yeah?
[10:25] <josh__> fredl: u will change your sshd.config file to not ask for passwords
[10:25] <nehoksan> did all of you masturbate today??
[10:25] <teclo-> Hello, I just installed linux-image-generic, and when I boot from it, I have no GUI at all... what is going on please ?
[10:25] <nehoksan> i didnt yet :D
[10:25] <DrNick_> Coffeegrinds, are you almost out of diskspace?
[10:25] <fredl> DrNick_, but the default Ubuntu install has PermitRootLogin yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[10:25] <agoole>  So my computer says it installed beryl and beryl-manager but when i run thoes commands is says /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6 is not found  ... any ideas?
[10:26] <josh__> lol
[10:26] <Coffeegrinds> Drnick, nope I've got 30gb left
[10:26] <Coffeegrinds> 40gb drive
[10:26] <threeseas> can we make this harder?
[10:26] <nehoksan> harder?
[10:26] <nehoksan> :o
[10:26] <DrNick_> hmm.  on both counts.

[10:28] <boink> apt-get install gaim then
[10:28] <poekert> it was installed with edgy
[10:28] <DrNick_> boink, or rather sudo apt-get install gaim ;)
[10:28] <XiXaQ> I have mounted the ubuntu desktop cd in /media/cdrom. How do I add it to the sources.list file?
[10:28] <boink> uninstall, reinstall it
[10:28] <poekert> k
[10:28] <Coffeegrinds> anyone  in  here good at  fixing Gnome craashes?
[10:29] <boink> I had to do that with mysql-server on edgy after an update from dapper
[10:29] <fredl> Coffeegrinds, I'm good at creating them, does that help?
[10:29] <e_machinist> In order to use the open-source ATI drivers, should I have Driver "ati", or Driver "radeon"?
[10:29] <e_machinist> In my xorg.conf
[10:29] <fredl> radeon
[10:29] <DrNick_> e_machinist, ati
[10:29] <Coffeegrinds> i din't even try myself
[10:29] <fredl> actually...
[10:30] <DrNick_> the open source ones are ati.  the commencial ones are radeon IIRC
[10:30] <fredl> I take that back. use ati like DrNick_ says
[10:30] <fredl> no the radeon ones are 2D I think.
[10:30] <fredl> the fglrx ones are the proprietary ones.
[10:30] <e_machinist> DrNick_: so, to use the DRI open source drivers, "ati", correct?
[10:30] <DrNick_> hmm.  I dunno then lol
[10:30] <Admiral_Chicago> e_machinist: i think the vesa is OS
[10:30] <poekert> nope, same problem. can't find libhowl
[10:30] <DrNick_> LOL libhowl
[10:30] <Admiral_Chicago> fglrx is definetly propriety
[10:31] <DrNick_> some of the lib files in linux distro's are so odd
[10:31] <fredl> the fglrx drivers are also the best drivers IMO
[10:31] <poekert> i have the avahi compat library install, but it doesn't seem to work
[10:32] <|rt|> anyone know what steps need to be taken to migrate from one distro to ubuntu when lvm is in the mix?
[10:32] <e_machinist> fredl: I prefer Open. Just a personal preference though.
[10:32] <|rt|> do i need to backup my /etc/lvm somewhere prior to putting ubuntu on the machine?
[10:32] <novaterata> Hi, I need some help on a couple of things particularly WINE and installing software with .run files, please /msg me
[10:32] <Juan___> Hi
[10:32] <fredl> e_machinist, me too, but not when 'open' means it doesn't recognize my video card.
[10:33] <DrNick_> |rt|, err, well providing you've partitioned correctly, i.e. seperated the stuff you want to keep from / then you should be able to just upgrade as ubuntu does LVM too
[10:33] <|rt|> DrNick_: yes...the question is will it automatically find any pv's, vg's, and lv's that are setup on the disks?
[10:33] <Juan___> Hmm, a question: when you mount a nfs filesystem, how do you cd to it ?
[10:33] <DrNick_> |rt|, it should do yeah :)
[10:33] <e_machinist> fredl: True, I have a Radeon 9200 in here though, so DRI and open drivers work good.
[10:34] <|rt|> DrNick_: or do i need to do a vgcfgbackup and then restore under ubuntu
[10:34] <DrNick_> |rt|, I'd do a backup too though just to be on the safe side
[10:34] <|rt|> DrNick_: yeah probably a good idea :)
[10:34] <fredl> e_machinist, I have an X740 and according to the open driver it should recognize that but it doesn't.
[10:34] <novaterata> Anytime I try to install something like the neverwinter nights linux installer which is a .run file it just won't work, says permissions denied even in root
[10:34] <sdfqw> how do i make my 3com 3c905b nic work in ubuntu server?
[10:34] <fredl> novaterata, chmod +x *.run
[10:34] <|rt|> DrNick_: if the root and boot aren't in the lvm do i need to do the alternative install iso or can i just use the server iso?
[10:35] <e_machinist> fredl: you never know, the one great thing about Open drivers is that half the time nobody knows why they don't work :D
[10:35] <DrNick_> novaterata, check if the .run file has eXecute permissions set on it.
[10:35] <fredl> novaterata, then ./bla.run
[10:35] <anderbubble> novaterata, you have to chmod a+x the file
[10:35] <ivx> hey how do ipods and ubuntu get along?
[10:35] <chrisp21> how can i install a package from source using apt?
[10:35] <novaterata> Is there any plans to make an installer that doesn't require that, its pretty obscure
[10:35] <poekert> chrisp:apt-source
[10:35] <fredl> apt-get source <package>
[10:35] <DrNick_> |rt|, you can use the server ISO - the partitioner in that is just the same as any of the others.  just make sure you don't select the auto-partition option ;)
[10:35] <fredl> ehr
[10:36] <DrNick_> ivx, iPods and ubuntu get on well :)
[10:36] <chrisp21> fredl: that puts the source in cwd, then what? i have to config,make,make install?
[10:36] <fredl> chrisp21, but then you still don't have a running package, you just have the source downloaded and you need to build it.

[10:36] <steveire> hey. I think I somehow busted my swap partition. free reports all zeros for swap and my edgy keeps crashing. Any idea how to fix it?
[10:36] <ivx> drnick alright just plug and play then? does it just show up as a usb drive then just drag my stuff over?

[10:36] <spaced> is there an ubuntu chan for newbs?
[10:37] <fredl> spaced, this is it!

[10:37] <novaterata> Also, how do you reset the wine configuration to default, it keeps saying i don't have a C drive even after i create one and close the window
[10:37] <bur[n] er> anyone know if there is a thunderbird tangerine icon theme?
[10:37] <jessie> hey does anybody know how to install from floppy
[10:37] <teclo> chuckyp: your hint did not work, no more gui....
[10:37] <fredl> bur[n] er, #thunderbird
[10:38] <|rt|> DrNick_: yeah i've been running it now for a couple of years on gentoo...but gentoo is just a bit more work than I want to deal with to maintain
[10:38] <DrNick_> ivx, well it appears in RhythmBox so you can play all your tunes off the iPod on that, to do transfers you need to install gtkpod, which is in the standard repo' IIRC

[10:38] <spaced> i need to debug a problem in firefox, how can I do it?
[10:38] <georgeb> steveire: run swapon -s to check the swap partitions setup; if you don't see anything check in /etc/fstab you should see something like: /dev/hda2 none swap sw 0 0
[10:38] <DrNick_> |rt|, yeah, my friend uses it - its a bit too much hastle for me too :)
[10:38] <willis_> novaterata,  you mean setup one in the wine configs? it may be lookin gat some other configs
[10:38] <spaced> is there an error log?
[10:39] <steveire> georgeb: No output from that. Does that tell you anything?
[10:39] <ivx> drnick, thanks
[10:39] <fredl> bur[n] er, tangerine is for newer versions of firefox than comes with Ubuntu
[10:39] <DrNick_> ivx, no probs.
[10:39] <steveire> I have that in fstab
[10:39] <novaterata> where are the wine configs located
[10:39] <mwe> novaterata: did you use winecfg to configure wine?
[10:39] <novaterata> yes i used winecfg
[10:39] <mwe> novaterata: you can define the drives there
[10:39] <fredl> bur[n] er, mozilla has it's own IRC server.
[10:39] <novaterata> no thats the whole problem
[10:39] <JayFM> Morning, can anyone help me connect to a WAP with WPA-PSK (TKIP) encryption? I have a Netgear Wireless PCI Adapter (WG311T)

[10:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about compriz - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[10:40] <georgeb> steveire: yes, I think you should check the fstab file
[10:40] <mwe> novaterata: I see
[10:40] <novaterata> thats why i want to reset the config
[10:40] <novaterata> uninstall install don't work
[10:40] <mwe> novaterata: well if you don't have any important programs installed in wine you can just remove ~/.wine
[10:40] <steveire> georgeb: Should I change the swap line in fstab? It looks like you suggested. sw 0 0
[10:41] <georgeb> steveire: try sudo swapon -a and see if you get any error
[10:41] <DrNick_> what's everyone's opinion of the no-root-user-use-sudo-instead approach which Ubuntu uses?  does anone else find it a bit annoying like me? I'm getting used to it, but I do prefer having a normal root user personally.
[10:41] <novaterata> so thats the config .wine
[10:41] <georgeb> steveire: swapon -a "mounts" the swap partitions in /etc/fstab
[10:41] <novaterata> ok thanks

[10:44] <georgeb> ey: I don't think that the "write" command does what you want... run man write to get info about "write"
[10:44] <fredl> JayFM, hard topic, you may need to ask several times.
[10:44] <steveire> georgeb: swapon: cannot stat /dev/hda11: No such file or directory. Looks like that device is gone from /dev/
[10:44] <JayFM> Hmk, i need to go now anyway. Thanks :)
[10:44] <fredl> n/p
[10:44] <Tini> hmm....
[10:44] <JayFM> Do you have any other ideas of where else i could ask?
[10:45] <mwe> if you use the network manager applet in gnome it's easy enough, isn't it?
[10:45] <JayFM> Nope. It doesn't offer WPA options.
[10:45] <JayFM> Only WEP
[10:45] <fredl> mwe, but network-manager doesn't support a whole lot of NIC's yet though.
[10:45] <mwe> it does here
[10:45] <LobWech> agoole http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=libc.so.6&searchmode=searchfiles&case=insensitive&version=edgy&arch=i386
[10:45] <mwe> fredl: maybe not
[10:45] <mwe> it offers WPA for me though
[10:45] <JayFM> I don't know how to install network-manager :P
[10:45] <fredl> edgy?
[10:45] <mwe> right
[10:45] <fredl> apt-get install network-manager ?
[10:45] <DrNick_> actually I've wondered how to set up WPA also, as before the only options I can find have been for WEP
[10:46] <georgeb> steveire: huh ?? hda11 :) lots of partitions of that drive; run sudo fdisk /dev/hda; then press "p" to get the partition table and see if you have any partition marked as "Linux swap / Solaris" then press "q" to exit from fdisk

[10:49] <GerManson> I upgraded to Edgy, but now my smp is missing!! =/
[10:50] <georgeb> steveire: hmm... you ran sudo swapon -a , right ?
[10:50] <soumyadc> childodoom: what is your kernel version
[10:50] <mwe> childodoom: ok the driver is installed. you need to edit xorg.conf now
[10:50] <steveire> yep.
[10:50] <jStefan> GerManson, install package "linux" which will install the default kernel with SMP support
[10:50] <rem__> GerM did you try apt-get install -f -.. ?
[10:50] <georgeb> steveire: check if /dev/hda10 exists.. ls -al /dev/hda10
[10:50] <fredl> cool, I was wondering why I didn't see in my update-manager that a new distro version was available....
[10:50] <DrNick_> it is funney actually there's a web based tool to apparantly help you find a linux distro which is right for you.  no matter which options you select, Ubuntu is nearly always in the list of results, most of the time its in the top 3
[10:51] <rem__> yea...the default is the "generic" for 686 smp now ...

[10:51] <fredl> DrNick_, you mean http://ubuntupropaganda.org ?
[10:51] <fredl> :P
[10:51] <ey> georgeb what is [tty]  ?
[10:51] <rem__> why does it keep packages back .. ? when apt upgrade ?
[10:51] <DrNick_> fredl, lol, nah, distrofinder.org or something
[10:52] <jStefan> rem__, apt is not very smart, try synaptic or aptitude
[10:52] <mwe> childodoom: the file /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics/README.Debian says what you need to change
[10:52] <GerManson> jStefan: ok, i'll reboot now
[10:52] <fredl> uhm jstefan.....
[10:52] <fredl> synaptic and aptitude use apt.
[10:52] <jStefan> GerManson, pick the "generic" one from the list
[10:52] <GerManson> jStefan: yep :) brb
[10:52] <georgeb> steveire: try sudo swapon /dev/hda10
[10:52] <jStefan> fredl, but in a more efficient way
[10:52] <childodoom> mwe: reading it now
[10:53] <jStefan> fredl, apt uses dpkg
[10:53] <rem__> hmm k...btw i can only in terminal cze since dapper its apparently not possible to configure a proxy with auth through gui ..
[10:53] <georgeb> steveire: to see if there is a problem in /etc/fstab, or not
[10:53] <mwe> childodoom: back up your current xorg.conf before changing it though
[10:53] <steveire> same output.
[10:53] <Pear> why isnt unbutu edgy loading this nvidia driver!?
[10:53] <childodoom> mwe: I will be sure to do so.
[10:53] <Rawr> cause its gay
[10:53] <fredl> Jstefan, APTitude uses apt more efficiently than APT does?
[10:54] <jStefan> fredl, something like that
[10:54] <steveire> I can't spend more itme on it at the moment. Thanks for your help. I'll do some googling later georgeb.
[10:54] <rem__> it didnt load my RADEOn module either...had no x after upgrade...but after apt-get the module it was ok again ..
[10:54] <DrNick_> also whats all this about it detetcting if you use SMP or not and installing the appropriate kernel? it didn't for me- I still had to install the SMP kernel after it was all set up.
[10:54] <jStefan> fredl, basicly thru less user interaction, you could you use wget and dpkg for everything, but that's not very efficient
[10:55] <fredl> I'd rather use apt :)
[10:55] <Pear> rem: i tried apt-get too but its still not loading :/
[10:55] <Pear> hmm, so annoying that with every update on linux SOMETHING screws up
[10:55] <fredl> APT has Super Cow Powers.

[10:56] <bordy> fair enough.

[10:57] <mwe> fredl: I heard using apt-get instead of aptitude for upgrading to edgy will break things though. just so you know

[10:57] <gnomefreak> mwe: other way around
[10:57] <soumyadc> bruenig, yes thats I mean to say
[10:57] <fredl> haha
[10:57] <fredl> apt rockz :)
[10:57] <mwe> gnomefreak: odd. I used aptitude
[10:57] <sess> Anyone mind helping me with a botched Edgy upgrade?
[10:58] <jStefan> mwe it just requires more user intervention, that's all
[10:58] <sess> my ndiswrapper is broken, and I can't install the ati fglrx driver now
[10:58] <fredl> gawd Edgy upgrades botch?
[10:58] <gnomefreak> mwe: if you have unofficial stuff like compiz/xgl/beryl aptitude is not a good thing to use
[10:58] <fredl> oh just ndiswrapper...
[10:58] <mwe> I see
[10:58] <bruenig> soumyadc, well the repositories are in /etc/apt/sources.list, so you could do sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment the repositories that you want. Or to enable them all a quick command that you can copy and paste is : sudo vim -c "%s/# deb/deb/g" -c "wq" /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update
[10:58] <soumyadc> bruenig, Oh you mean to say If I add a new repo then the existing will not be deleted. I am not sure about this . Is it raly like taht
[10:58] <gnomefreak> sess: what is wrong with it
[10:59] <sess> gnomefreak: when I try to modprobe ndiswrapper, I get an fatal error inserting the module
[10:59] <gnomefreak> sess: can i have full error?
[10:59] <sess> gnomefreak: FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Invalid argument
[11:00] <DrNick_> does the file exist?
[11:00] <gnomefreak> mwe: update-manager -c will fix things like that for you now. we fixed it to fix libgl1-mesa-glx and -desktop packages
[11:00] <gnomefreak> sess: do you have the restricte modules package installed?
[11:00] <gnomefreak> restricted*
[11:00] <soumyadc> bruenig, hah! this is a nice trick :-). thnx for thoes infos
[11:01] <sess> gnomefreak: I think so, let me check
[11:01] <mwe> gnomefreak: that's great. update-manager was broken for me, complaining about missing functions or something, though

[11:04] <mwe> cge: I'm using the one from mozilla.com as well
[11:04] <sess> gnomefreak: I have restricted-386.  I just installed restricted-generic, and yes, drivers from ati.com, but the installer doesn't work anymore after the upgrade
[11:04] <sess> gnomefreak: Ill brb, after doing the restricted-generic the system wants me to reboot
[11:04] <gnomefreak> sess: did the installer for the ati drivers build its own restricted modules package by chance?
[11:04] <sess> gnomefreak: now that I have no idea
[11:05] <gnomefreak> sess: reinstall restricted modules package ill be back after dinner

[11:34] <Music_Shuffle> Pete: Right, but if you had two options and tried one...the other's always a nice idea.
[11:34] <Sutur> Music_Shuffle: You
[11:34] <Jimbob> can i get some (hopefully) quick advice from someone about a problem I'm having with ubuntu?
[11:34] <bruenig> !ask | Jimbob
[11:34] <ubotu> Jimbob: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:34] <Jimbob> OK thanks
[11:34] <pete> Music_Shuffle: Yeah, true... I always was lazy though =P
[11:34] <Sutur> Music_Shuffle: You'd think that would happen but no...it just kept going...
[11:34] <Markive> sutur i've never moved a folder while it was being d/l to but i rekon if i did i would get a big fat error
[11:34] <Jimbob> I am trying to instal java
[11:34] <Jimbob> I can get it to work if I login as root but not if I login under my username
[11:35] <Jimbob> Near as I can tell everything is done correctly
[11:35] <Sutur> Markive: No error, just a "Download Complete!" message.
[11:35] <bruenig> Jimbob, how did you install java?
[11:35] <Music_Shuffle> Odd. My files even that I'm messing with right now stop if I move the folder.
[11:35] <Jimbob> well, being very new, I donloaded the latest version and installed it using the terminal window
[11:35] <Jimbob> I did that successfully, even created the symbolic link
[11:36] <bruenig> Jimbob, did you use the ubuntu repositories or download it from the java website seperately?
[11:36] <Markive> jimbob i installed it with the synaptic package thingy
[11:36] <Jimbob> the link showed inactive, even though it was in the right place
[11:36] <Jimbob> so I changed the permissions and now it shows the link properly
[11:36] <Jimbob> I downloaded it direclty from java.com
[11:36] <Jimbob> Is there a better place to download it from?
[11:36] <alex1z> so.. sombody can help me ?? how reinstall grub, I try apt-get install grub, but dont work
[11:37] <Flannel> !java | Jimbob
[11:37] <ubotu> Jimbob: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[11:37] <Markive> the synaptic package manager
[11:37] <bruenig> Jimbob, it is recommended that you use the repositories and it is much easier. Do you know how to uninstall java? If so it would be easier to remove java and then download and install it from the repositories
[11:37] <Markive> jimbob just make sure you have the multiverse repo enabled
[11:37] <Jimbob> I do not know how to remove it
[11:38] <Jimbob> what is the multiverse repo and how do I enable it?
[11:38] <Sutur> SOB started from scratch again.
[11:38] <bruenig> Jimbob, you need to remove the other java before you install from the multiverse repo
[11:38] <Markive> open the synaptic manager its under system> admin?synaptic
[11:38] <Sutur> 20 hours...tsk.
[11:38] <atarinox> do i need to worry about defragging my hard drive often in xubuntu?
[11:38] <bruenig> Jimbob, if you know where all the files are located you can probably just delete all of them. If not you probably have a very messy situation
[11:39] <eobanb> atarinox, no
[11:39] <Jimbob> I believe I know where everything is...
[11:39] <Markive> jimbob i agree, it might go t*ts up if you install it twice
[11:39] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> who can help me by my display problem
[11:39] <Jimbob> bruenig - is it possible to delete an entire directory tree with one command?
[11:39] <bruenig> Jimbob, if you believe you know where everything is, just go ahead and delete all of the files. That is the same as uninstalling
[11:40] <Markive> deltree
[11:40] <bruenig> Jimbob, sudo rm -rf /path/to/directory/tree
[11:40] <Vaske_Car> Is there any spam filter for Evolution?
[11:40] <Jimbob> bruenig thanks for the help, i'll give it a shot
[11:40] <ifireball> Jimbob: careful there.. its quite destructive... don't delete the wrong thing...
[11:40] <Jimbob> :)
[11:41] <dizzie> Vaske_Car, Spamasassin
[11:41] <Jimbob> I have nothing to lose... this is a clean install and if I screw up too badly I can just wipe it and start again
[11:41] <bruenig> Jimbob, that's the spirit
[11:42] <lupine_85> rm -r :D
[11:42] <ifireball> bruenig: also, are you absolutly sure the "f" is totally neccesary there? using "-f" too much is a bad habit
[11:42] <Markive> from my clean install a few weeks ago , i went into synaptic and search java, and installed the 2 things it came up with i needed
[11:42] <ey> what command cloeses a text from other people
[11:42] <atarinox> is there an apt-get or aptitude command to remove package files once theyre installed?
[11:42] <gnomefreak> ifthe -f isnt bad at all
[11:42] <bruenig> ifireball, the f makes it shorter because you don't have to keep entering yes for all of the files. Especially in a directory tree that is going to be a lot of yes or no responses
[11:43] <ey>  i am using console to talk to ppl
[11:43] <ey> and i want to close from one guy
[11:43] <frank23> I'm having a strange issue: In kubuntu dapper, I'm running firefox 1.5 and mythtranscode at the same time. mythtranscode uses up all my CPU. when mythtranscode runs at nice=19, firefox is responsive and working fine. when mythtranscode runs at nice=17 (the default), firefox is so slow it's not usable. All the other programs run fine. Any ideas?
[11:43] <ey> what command is it .to close on him
[11:43] <gnomefreak> ifireball: the -f is --fix-missing
[11:43] <Jimbob> bruenig - I nuked my install folder so I think all is gone now, except the symbolic link in firefox... I'll kill that now.  What do I need to tell synaptic to do?
[11:43] <Vaske_Car> dizzie, how it work? Do i need to do anything after installation?
[11:43] <gnomefreak> ey: what are you using?
[11:43] <ey> puffy
[11:43] <Markive> go in settings
[11:43] <ey> unix :P
[11:43] <Coffeegrinds> WOOHOO!!! 30 seconds of Gnomelyness
[11:44] <Markive> then repos
[11:44] <ifireball> bruenig: unless "rm" is aliased to be "rm -i" you don't need "-f" when running noramlly it deletes everything other then files thast have been specifically markd "read only" without asking
[11:44] <Markive> jimbob then tick multiverse
[11:44] <ey> gnomefreak what command is it .to close the message from other people ?
[11:44] <ey> i am just chatting on console
[11:44] <gnomefreak> ey: what chat client?
[11:44] <Markive> jimbob it will reload the availible apps, then search for java
[11:44] <ey> puffy
[11:44] <bruenig> Jimbob, a simple command to get java is : sudo vim -c "%s/# deb/deb/g" -c "wq" /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre
[11:44] <ey> i am using unix puffy
[11:44] <gnomefreak> ey: dont know puffy try /wc
[11:44] <dizzie> Vaske_Car, its turned off by default, but you can edit/change that in the config file (its a =1 instead of =0) you have to edit
[11:45] <david_> i downloaded the cd iso and the dvd iso and burned them both to discs, but they seem to be identical, can some tell me what im not seeing?
[11:45] <Jimbob> simple, eh?  I'll give it a shot
[11:45] <bruenig> ifireball, what does the f do then
[11:45] <Markive> jimbob if you new to ubuntu i'd stick to the synaptic package manager
[11:45] <gnomefreak> bruenig: i answered that above its --fix-missing
[11:46] <Markive> its normally easier to undo mistakes
[11:46] <bruenig> gnomefreak, -f, --force           ignore nonexistent files, never prompt
[11:46] <LHenr1> Hi Guys- I am migrating to Ubuntu today.  1. Questions - Does Ubuntu update it's self automatically 2. and do I need to load a AV package on this system right now?
[11:46] <gnomefreak> bruenig: no it doesnt
[11:46] <bruenig> gnomefreak, ok, that is just what the rm --help dialog pops up
[11:46] <bruenig> so I assumed that is what it was
[11:47] <bruenig> and that is what man rm says
[11:47] <ifireball> bruenig: it forces delete without warning in any case, in the normal cases that is not what you want as rm wil delete everything but read-only files (e.g. files you own but rmoved the write permission)
[11:47] <Markive> lhenr1 1 yes it does update itself and 2 what?
[11:47] <david_> i downloaded the cd iso and the dvd iso and burned them both to discs, but they seem to be identical, can some tell me what im not seeing?
[11:47] <LHenr1> antivirus.. does Ubuntu really need it?
[11:47] <gnomefreak> bruenig: rm -rf it may force i thought you meant apt-get
[11:47] <SlyGuy> hey.. can anyone tell me why this command doesn;t exclude any of the directories i have listed?
[11:47] <gnomefreak> LHenr1: depends on what you plan on doing with it
[11:47] <Markive> lhenr1 i havn't got any
[11:47] <SlyGuy> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/8DMiR727.html
[11:47] <georgeb> do you know why I have LANG=en_AU.UTF-8  LANGUAGE=en_AU:en  setup ? where do I set this ?
[11:47] <bruenig> ifireball, in normal cases that is not what you want right, but he is deleting a directory tree that is clearly going to be read only, so that is what you want
[11:48] <gnomefreak> LHenr1: not really for normal usage
[11:48] <mcphail> LHenr1: at this point in time, no. But linux is not immune to viruses
[11:48] <bruenig> gnomefreak, I figured there had been some sort of miscommunication there somewhere
[11:48] <SlyGuy> it just go ahead and TARS everything
[11:48] <gnomefreak> bruenig: rm -r should be enough
[11:48] <LHenr1> Markive - thanks  man- Sick of Windows - bored really and this is really looking nice thus far.. thanks again.
[11:48] <Markive> i made my lappy duel boot, something it would takes ages to learn in linux
[11:49] <Jimbob> bruenig - I ran that command as specified
[11:49] <Jimbob> Got a couple of errors
[11:49] <Markive> jimbob , use the synaptic manager trust me
[11:49] <LHenr1> This is running on a PII 350 and it's doing great.
[11:49] <ifireball> bruenig: the tree beign readl only in unlikely unless he copyed it off a cd with "-p" or something, its just that using "-f" is a bad habid that comes back to bite you at the wrong time; its nights of restroing backups talking here... ;)
[11:49] <bruenig> Jimbob, it should have listed a whole bunch of repos, and then downloaded java and then installed it. At what part of that sequence did you get the errors
[11:49] <Markive> jimbob now you got to try and undo that
[11:49] <bruenig> Markive, synaptic = apt-get it is the same thing
[11:50] <ey> semboy@SigurNafnjesu:~$ ls | wc -l 34 .users are logged in .so what command allowes to check who they are
[11:50] <Markive> but its a nice gui graphical tool
[11:50] <Markive> and easy for n00bs like me
[11:50] <Vaske_Car> dizzie, WHere is that conf file located? Also is this for server or can be used on client machines as well?
[11:50] <Jimbob> I realize that... what do I need to install from there then markive?
[11:50] <Markive> it works
[11:50] <bruenig> ifireball, alright, well in this case it wasn't harmful. I guess different preferences. I generally don't throw around rm commands so generally when I do, I am fairly sure in my decision
[11:51] <Vaske_Car> dizzie, I am a bi5t confused because it says that this is for servers....
[11:51] <bordy> GAAAH! Every time I open either firefox or flock, I get like 10 seconds of use and it shuts.
[11:51] <Markive> just open it and search for java, afetr you went to settings/repositorys and ticked multiverse

[11:52] <kaffeewoller> grothesk: what do you mean?
[11:52] <Jimbob> bruenig is correct, *everything* is ticked including multiverse
[11:52] <Jimbob> So what now?
[11:52] <grothesk> I can not install nvidia-glx together with kernel-generic on edgy.
[11:52] <Markive> bruenig i'd have no idea what that ment at all... hense i said use the super simple way, the synaptic way
[11:52] <gnomefreak> grothesk: are you using amaraths repo?
[11:52] <Jimbob> A search for java yields 121 packages
[11:52] <Markive> jimbob search for java] 
[11:52] <grothesk> nvidia-glx keeps pulling kernel-i386 into edgy.
[11:52] <bruenig> Markive what can be simpler than copy and paste
[11:53] <Jimbob> do I tick them all for install?
[11:53] <grothesk> gnomefreak: No, I don't.
[11:53] <LHenr1> Let me rephase Loaded windows in about an hour and 20 minutes for Ubuntu.
[11:53] <Markive> na i'll look hold on
[11:53] <XiCillin> does anybody know if i can use a 300-watt 500VA UPS on a machine with a 750-watt power supply?
[11:53] <gnomefreak> grothesk: what does uname -r say?
[11:53] <bruenig> Jimbob, the package you are looking for is called sun-java5-jre
[11:53] <LHenr1> xicillin - yeah if your expecting a over load.
[11:53] <grothesk> 2.6.17-10-386 I'm on386 because generic does not boot up into X.
[11:53] <math_> hello
[11:53] <Markive> jimbob jr2e + mozilla plugin
[11:53] <gnomefreak> grothesk: thats why its installing the -386
[11:54] <XiCillin> Lhenr1, what doyou mean by that
[11:54] <grothesk> No.
[11:54] <SlyGuy> man this is annoying.. why would TAR ignore my exclude statements?
[11:54] <bruenig> Jimbob, and for the plugin, it is sun-java5-plugin
[11:54] <Markive> jimbob and the sun packages
[11:54] <math_> does someone know what x-terminal-emulator windowmaker normaly uses?
[11:54] <gnomefreak> grothesk: yes unless you install it manully
[11:54] <grothesk> I was on generic and dis apt-get install nvidia-glx.
[11:54] <Jimbob> I have *nothing* called sun anything
[11:54] <LHenr1> 750PS and 500 UPS -  it's going to overload.
[11:54] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: did you sudo apt-get update
[11:54] <LHenr1> it's gonna run, but beep at you too.
[11:54] <bruenig> Jimbob, open a terminal and do sudo apt-get install sun-java5-bin, and tell me what the output is
[11:55] <Markive> jimbob   sun-java5-bin
[11:55] <Markive> Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0
[11:55] <grothesk> But I'm sure that I installed nvidida-glx togehter with kernel-generic on a different computer.
[11:55] <XiCillin> LHenr1, but will it hurt my machine?
[11:55] <knix> Can anyone tell me why I would use Xgl over xorg+composite for running beryl?
[11:55] <math_> does someone know which x-terminal-emulator windowmaker normaly uses?
[11:55] <LHenr1> nope
[11:55] <porkpie> hi guy's I am trying to install this but it fails apt-get installl libmysql++-dev
[11:55] <porkpie> E: Invalid operation installl
[11:55] <Jimbob> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[11:55] <gnomefreak> grothesk: only if your booted to -generic. when booted to -386 it reads 386
[11:56] <XiCillin> LHenr1, sweet thanks
[11:56] <georgeb> !beryl | knix
[11:56] <ubotu> knix: beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[11:56] <LHenr1> not at all , but you will not have a shutdown period time.
[11:56] <SlyGuy> anyone back up their system using TAR?
[11:56] <bruenig> Jimbob, you have to close synaptic, you can't have synaptic open and use apt-get commands at the same time
[11:56] <knix> georgeb: yes, but it has OpenGL in Xorg
[11:56] <LHenr1> but you may not be using that feature.
[11:56] <ey> can i use my console to connect to the putty ?
[11:56] <Jimbob> also E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[11:56] <gnomefreak> SlyGuy: i have many tars
[11:56] <XiCillin> LHenr1, thats my biggest concern ints a 3500 dollar machine, i dont car if the battery doesn't last long i just get bad surges and dips
[11:56] <bruenig> Jimbob, you have to close synaptic, you can't have synaptic open and use apt-get commands at the same time
[11:56] <Jimbob> ok
[11:56] <davinchy> hoooooooooooooooooooola
[11:56] <Jimbob> trying again
[11:56] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: close synaptic before trying to use apt-get in terminal
[11:56] <porkpie> jimbob:do you have the gui installer open
[11:56] <georgeb> knix: I was trying to suggest you to go to ubuntu-xgl, I think you might get more support there ;-)
[11:57] <SlyGuy> gnomefreak: can you look at http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/8DMiR727.html and tell me why excludes are being ignored?
[11:57] <knix> georgeb: ah, thanks =)
[11:57] <grothesk> gnomefreak: I actually WAS an generic. Then I installed nvidia-glx. After a reboot, X froze. Nothing alive. Not even ssh'ing into that box.
[11:57] <LHenr1> well, thats all your battery backup is going to do.. filter the electricity.
[11:57] <Jimbob> ok at the end
[11:57] <Jimbob> E: Couldn't find package sun-java5-bin
[11:57] <porkpie> guy's how do I clean  the distro ?
[11:57] <grothesk> Then I bootet the newliy installed i386-Kernel. This was able to start X.
[11:57] <porkpie> jimbob:is this a new install
[11:57] <Markive> jimbob you got all the repo ticked?
[11:57] <Jimbob> (sorry for the slow responses guys - I'm using IRC on my windows machine and typing in all the error messages)
[11:57] <XiCillin> LHenr1, yea i didn't know if when the power did go out, that it wouldn't supply it with enough power and i would ruin the electronics
[11:58] <bruenig> Jimbob, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sun-java5-bin
[11:58] <gnomefreak> SlyGuy: that looks fine to me although i dont use wildcards so i dont know if that is whats wrong. what is the exact error
[11:58] <XiCillin> LHenr1, but if it wont then evertyhhign is cool
[11:58] <LHenr1> nope you should be fine.
[11:58] <bruenig> Jimbob, it didn't update last time because you had synaptic open
[11:58] <SlyGuy> there is not error.. it jsut tars those excludes
[11:58] <SlyGuy> no
[11:58] <gnomefreak> SlyGuy: than does it unpack ok?
[11:58] <theD3viL> i cant umount things with user (using ivman) .. what's wrong?
[11:58] <chrisknight> anyone have lockup issues when booting edgy CD on a dell e1705?
[11:59] <Jimbob> bruenig - same error - couldn't find package
[11:59] <Jimbob> do I need tor eboot or something?
[11:59] <SlyGuy> well i kill it when i see its backuping everything
[11:59] <SlyGuy> backing up
[11:59] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: multiverse isnt enabled
[11:59] <Jimbob> The only thing open was firefox

[11:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about quote - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:59] <porkpie> bruenig:how do I clean the distro ....I am trying to install libmysql++-dev  but it fails
[12:00] <gnomefreak> SlyGuy: i suggest you dont use the wildcards if you dont want that to happen
[12:00] <bruenig> Jimbob, no, try this command once more, perhaps synaptic interfered sudo vim -c "%s/# deb/deb/g" -c "wq" /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sun-java5-bin
[12:00] <LHenr1> Since I am a bit new LINUX and UBUNTU OS's - Where can I go to find out how I can play some decent games. Please no insults intended, but the basic Ubuntu ones are going to cut it. I have a need to shoot and kill eletronic players.
[12:00] <ifireball> anyone here noticed ctrl+alt+{+/-} stopped working on X in edgy? (xvidtune -next still works)
[12:00] <bruenig> porkpie, no idea
