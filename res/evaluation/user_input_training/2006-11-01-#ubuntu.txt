[12:01] <scott> hi, can anyone help me? i cant seem to apt-get remove gmediaserver, and error comes up about dpkg saying that invoking gmediaserver stop failed, (ive tried running command it says it stopped but sitll wont remove it), any way to force remove it?
[12:01] <Akebono89> dmesg has a bunch of "device not accepting address7, error -110" type messages
[12:01] <blazemonger> crass: true
[12:01] <Abst> I tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and it didnt work
[12:02] <Daviey> phanter, If you prefer GUI's.  This might help http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=216117
[12:02] <blazemonger> that is where gentoo is beating ubuntu..if ubuntu were to install all of the dev requirements it would abolish redhat and mandriva
[12:02] <Tatey> gentoo isnt beating anyone
[12:02] <phanter> Daviey: I have no X running.. and I prefer to have no X running :)
[12:02] <iter> haha gentoo is too busy recompiling to do much else
[12:02] <AlReece45> In edgy, will sounds directed to alsa or does it use oss drivers for it?
[12:02] <Daviey> phanter, fury muff
[12:02] <phanter> Daviey: maybe you have experience using it in the console
[12:02] <blazemonger> the only thing i dont like about linux are the window managers..i want something more along the interface of amiga workbench
[12:02] <Akebono89> is this thing on?
[12:03] <TGPO> Gentoo -- Linux for the OCD
[12:03] <Abst> Daviey: Nothing has worked yet
[12:03] <mabus> how do i get ubuntu to give me the grub menu when it boots up
[12:03] <phanter> !fury muff
[12:03] <mabus> instead of doing the default without prompt
[12:03] <cratel-1> I upgraded from dapper to edgy just to get a print server working but still no dice. This is getting very old...
[12:03] <Daviey> phanter, What have you actually done in the lvm process.  You have installed the package?
[12:03] <TGPO> mabus you can change that in the menu.list in /boot
[12:03] <blazemonger> that's the beauty of linux though..if i learned a descent amount of c/c++ i could develop my own window manager
[12:03] <AlReece45> iter: too much compiling... ha, only compiled 7 programs/drivers and a kernel so far here, that was just to get everything working, thats because a few wouldn't compile
[12:03] <Abst> Daviey: Also between the nVidia conf and usual conf there is nothing different but device names and resoloutions
[12:03] <mabus> TGPO: no, I need like a key sequence on boot or something
[12:03] <mabus> TGPO: I need to get into rescue mode
[12:04] <cratel-1> does anybody have a working print server cupsd.conf file for edgy?
[12:04] <scott> any way to force remove a package that wont remove? (and wont now let me install any either due to it beign stuck in a loop that it cant remove the package), tried -f but still doesnt work
[12:04] <mabus> TGPO: ah, esc in like, 2 seconds of time, I got it
[12:04] <mabus> not much of a window..
[12:04] <Daviey> Abst, If they are identical.  i really don't think it's something your doing.  Maybe the packaged driver doesn't like your card.  Personally i would try installing the driver from source
[12:04] <phanter> Daviey: yes... I also did the pvcreate comand on both disk...
[12:04] <kandinski> blazemonger, if you learned a decent amount of c/c++ you could develop a new shell for windows too. People do. And you already have AmiWM
[12:05] <Abst>  Daviey Isn't the driver binary only?
[12:05] <blazemonger> crass:wouldn't it be neat if Ubuntu installed ALL of the dev requirements
[12:05] <frederick85> what's the package name for apache , mysql and PHP
[12:05] <Daviey> scott, have you tried purge
[12:05] <scott> no
[12:05] <scott> is that dpkg?
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[12:05] <kandinski> blazemonger: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~marcus/amiwm.html
[12:05] <phanter> Daviey: when looking with fdisk (linux version of course) then it is a lvm partition (of whatever you call those things)
[12:05] <Daviey> Abst, sorry it is - but it will probably be a newer version
[12:05] <scott> purge didnt work, same error :(
[12:05] <phanter> but now I have to format then with ext3, but I do not understand how
[12:05] <Abst> Daviey: Anyway, thanks. Shower now
[12:05] <Daviey> phanter, what about a pvscan
[12:06] <Daviey> Abst, good luck
[12:06] <scott> says a pre-removal script has failed :(
[12:06] <kandinski> blazemonger: be scared, be very scared ;)
[12:06] <frederick85> what's the package name for apache , mysql and PHP
[12:06] <blazemonger> kandinski: you rule!!!
[12:06] <phanter> Daviey: pvscan returns this: No matching physical volumes found
[12:06] <kandinski> google does. I just open the tap.
[12:06] <blazemonger> this is great..since i don't like gnome OR kde
[12:06] <mcsmurf> lamp normally
[12:06] <mcsmurf> ;)
[12:06] <nikin> hy
[12:06] <Vladaz> are there any software that would have albums library such as winamp to listen to mp3?
[12:06] <blazemonger> i want to make a live cd distro that has nothing but amiga stuff
[12:06] <xing> i'm having difficulties setting up mysql on a debian server install. during installation i picked the LAMP option and when i /etc/init.d/mysql start, i get an error saying: mysqld got signal 4;
[12:06] <lazzareth> This is my 3rd Attempt to install edgy Eft on my desktop pc, On fresh new partitions .. but i constantly get an ERROR 17: from grub when trying to boot the installed OS
[12:07] <phanter> Daviey: but when I do pvcreate /dev/hda3 it returns: Device /hda3 not found (or ignored by filtering).
[12:07] <Vladaz> for ubuntu gnome?
[12:07] <blazemonger> that's how much of a amiga fanatic I am
[12:07] <Daviey> phanter, sounds like it didn't correctly create it then
[12:07] <kandinski> blazemonger: this is an 8 year old WM
[12:07] <LjL> blazemonger: there's amithlon already.
[12:07] <phanter> Daviey: so how do I delete them and recreate them in the correct way (because I did follow the guides)
[12:07] <blazemonger> one thing that came naturally to me when i installed linux was the scripting stuff
=== G-net|Gilnim is now known as Gilnim
[12:08] <blazemonger> what's that
[12:08] <blazemonger> what's amithlon?
[12:08] <btb103> so i'm trying to install ubuntu on my new AMD64 system and i can only get as far as it booting into x-windows and failing because it is "configured incorrectly" - the log file seems to show that my x850xt is being detected but then a fatal error occurs and it takes me to a command line prompt
[12:08] <Daviey> phanter, when you fdisked it.  Did you create a primary partition?
[12:08] <AlReece45> My sound works, but Open Sound System doesn't output or locks up. How can I get OSS or OSS emulation working?
[12:08] <LjL> blazemonger: a very optimized amiga emulator tangled with a customized linux kernel, that boots up like a PC operating system.
[12:08] <LjL> not free software.
[12:08] <Daviey> phanter, if i remember correctly the type of the partition should be '8e' aswell
[12:09] <nikin> i have a big Question :D , i want a terminal based network i have 6 P2 300 -s with 128MB of RAM and i want them to run some office programs, a browser and email... so i was thinking installing a server, and then doing something like remote login, to run the programs on the server.
[12:09] <blazemonger> LjL: mm..i want to develop my own
[12:09] <blazemonger> but one that's free
[12:09] <phanter> Daviey: yes, and I formatted with 8E (Linux LVM)
[12:09] <nikin> first question: can that be made?
[12:09] <btb103> so i'm trying to install ubuntu on my new AMD64 system and i can only get as far as it booting into x-windows and failing because it is "configured incorrectly" - the log file seems to show that my x850xt is being detected but then a fatal error occurs and it takes me to a command line prompt
[12:09] <LjL> blazemonger: hardly can be, since the Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted. have a look at http://www.aros.org maybe
[12:09] <pkh> can someone tell me what the apt-??? command is to reconfigure my xorg.conf?
[12:09] <Daviey> phanter, okay pvcreate /dev/hda3 defiently does not work?
[12:10] <nikin> second is: if yes then what package(s) i need for that
[12:10] <LjL> pkh: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:10] <pkh> LjL, thanks
[12:10] <nikin> third is: do you know any tutorial describing something like that
[12:10] <Icoo> Hello people...has anyone here a Broadcom 4311 wireless card and got it to work?
[12:10] <blazemonger> being stoned and using ubuntu is fun
[12:10] <blazemonger> it's the stoner-friendly os heh
[12:10] <Daviey> phanter, presumably you are doing that as root/sudo?
[12:10] <phanter> Daviey: I do not understand, because I did that already before, but now it returns:  Physical volume "/dev/hda3" successfully created
[12:11] <phanter> Daviey: sudo :)
[12:11] <blazemonger> can a window manager be coded using python?
[12:11] <Daviey> phanter, Crazy!
[12:11] <nikin> Blaze: yup
[12:11] <Daviey> phanter, then do vgcreate vg /dev/hda3
[12:11] <rbil> nikin: see this ... it's an interesting way to do what you want ... http://linuxgazette.net/124/smith.html
[12:11] <nikin> there is one made alredy :D
[12:11] <TGPO> blazemonger google around there prolly already ie
[12:11] <Daviey> phanter, vg = name of volume group.  I always use 'vg'
[12:12] <blazemonger> nikin ; since i have ideas for a window manager but make it recreational drug friendly lol
[12:12] <AlReece45> Icoo, yes, unless you want the slower open source drivers (doesn't support high speeds), compile ndiswrapper 1.23 and use the windows driver
[12:12] <nikin> rbil: ty
[12:12] <phanter> Daviey: now I get the error I always get :(: No physical volume label read from /dev/hda3 \\ /dev/hda3 not identified as an existing physical volume \\ Unable to add physical volume '/dev/hda3' to volume group 'vg'.
[12:12] <phanter> Daviey: and \\ is a new line
[12:13] <rambo3> blazemonger, go #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:13] <blazemonger> crass: is there a way to have all of the development requirements installeed on ubuntu?
[12:13] <notwist> how do i make nautilus not open a new window for each time i go deeper in the file system? i want it like before, with buttons at the top symbolizing each folder :(
[12:13] <blazemonger> it's like alot of the dev stuff is spread out and not in one place
[12:13] <Daviey> phanter, what does 'sudo pvdisplay' return
[12:14] <phanter> Daviey: it returns: PV Name               /dev/evms/hda3
[12:14] <cratel-1> how do I generate a certificate in the ssl directory of cups?
[12:14] <Icoo> AlReece45: can you pm me for a sec
[12:14] <phanter> Daviey: and it returns: Allocatable           NO
[12:14] <Epidemik> how do you forcequit?
[12:14] <Daviey> phanter, evms?!
[12:14] <btb103> so i'm trying to install ubuntu on my new AMD64 system and i can only get as far as it booting into x-windows and failing because it is "configured incorrectly" - the log file seems to show that my x850xt is being detected but then a fatal error occurs and it takes me to a command line prompt
[12:15] <phanter> Daviey: It is what it says, I just copy-paste
[12:15] <Epidemik> how do you forcequit? or see a list of running processs?
[12:15] <Daviey> phanter, never heard of evms.  What happens if you  'vgcreate vg /dev/evms/hda3'
[12:15] <AlReece45> Icoo: did you get it or am I still having trouble with PM?
[12:15] <phanter> Daviey: sudo vgcreate vg /dev/evms/hda3 \\  Volume group "vg" successfully created

[12:17] <Icoo> AlReece45: well we can also chat here, what laptop do you have
[12:17] <nikin> cratel: if you have driver for Linux then CUPS and SAMBA will do the job.
[12:17] <Daviey> phanter, forgot another stage 'vgdisplay vg | grep "Total PE"'
[12:17] <rambo3> !doesn't work
[12:17] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[12:18] <AlReece45> Icoo: Compaq Presario v6030
[12:18] <cratel-1> nikin I've tried all that...in dapper and now edgy. If you know something more than referring me to the sites ubotu mentions, could you help me?
[12:18] <salim> hi, how do I get to know what my FSB of my CPU is?
[12:18] <eXistenZ> salim, Read the specs!
[12:18] <Daviey> phanter, then what that returns type lvcreate -l 99999 vg -n (where 9999 = what prev command returned)
[12:18] <phanter> Daviey: returns: Total PE              12401    ... what does that mean?
[12:18] <nikin> cartel: maybe... tell me the exact situation
[12:18] <Icoo> AlReece45: well we seem to be under the same hood I have a HP NX7400...do you run Edgy?
[12:18] <salim> mine doesnt has any
[12:19] <youssef> <TGPO>  i tried it  it  didn
[12:19] <salim> isnt there any code?
[12:19] <TGPO> salim spend some time reading the output of 'lshal'
[12:19] <Daviey> phanter, so lvcreate -l 912401 vg -n storage
[12:19] <cpl-tnt44> how do i switch between languages in the keyboard layout on ubuntu (on windows its Alt+Shift)...???
[12:19] <AlReece45> Icoo: yes

[12:20] <Icoo> AlReece45: well my problem is that Edgy recognized the card right away after install, and I could see it in networking but when I type lspci it still says unknown device 4311
[12:20] <n1gke> Epidemik, in a terminal use ps ax
[12:20] <youssef> <TGPO>  E: Invalid operation fwcutter

[12:20] <TGPO> youssef enable universal in your repository and try apt-getting it again
[12:20] <Daviey> phanter, do you want the filesystem to be ext3?
[12:21] <AlReece45> Icoo: Well, yes, but as it's working right now it says the same thing still.
[12:21] <phanter> Daviey: It does not work and returns: sudo lvcreate -l 912401 vg -n datalvm \\   /dev/dvd: open failed: Read-only file system  \\  Insufficient free extents (12401) in volume group vg: 912401 requir

[12:26] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: well, i don't know it, because i'm running KDE. if someone else knows, i suppose they'd tell you
[12:26] <nikin> cpl-tnt44 : did it work?
[12:26] <AlReece45> Icoo: you need bcmwl5.sys too
[12:26] <Kannix> cpl-tnt44: Did you check out system - preferences - keyboard already?
[12:26] <rbil> I'd say most of the people in this channel are lurkers or haven't figured out how to disconnect from irc
[12:26] <Combatjuan> Does anyone know if there a way to empty a text file without deleting it?
[12:27] <Icoo> AlReece45: ok one more....this guide is for dapper, did you modified the steps for edgy?
[12:27] <LjL> Combatjuan: try shred
[12:27] <phanter> Daviey: oke, now I also have a whole disk /dev/hdc to add to the lvm module... will you help me with that as well?
[12:27] <Combatjuan> I know it would be trivial to open it with vi and ":g/^/d"
[12:27] <rambo3> Combatjuan, you mean truncate
[12:27] <cbx33> Hi guys just put a sound card into my edgy machine....and now the system is really really laggy, but with no visible processes running....IRQ conflict?
[12:27] <AlReece45> Icoo, in reality I did it on edgy (shh)
=== GyKyt is now known as Cap0ne
[12:28] <Daviey> phanter, hmm.. thats pretty much the same as b4
[12:28] <Jestre> Combatjuan: echo '' > filename
[12:28] <phanter> Daviey: I see, I will try and get back if it does not work :0
[12:28] <Icoo> AlReece45: in reality??? what do you mean?
[12:28] <Daviey> phanter, take it to chat?
[12:28] <cbx33> in that it is effecting the mouse and keyboard
[12:28] <nikin> Combatjua: owerwrite it with an empty file
[12:28] <phanter> Daviey: it will be mainly the part where I add it to the already created lvm
[12:28] <Combatjuan> LjL: I don't think that's quite a want but it is interesting.  Thanks.
[12:28] <cbx33> but running a top command shows nothing
[12:28] <AlReece45> Icoo, I did it on Edgy, but there was no reason it shouldn't have worked on dapper.
[12:28] <AskHL> Hello, I would like to install Xubuntu Eft on my Xubuntu Dapper computer. However I have heard bad things about the upgrade, so I want to use a CD. How, is there any way of installing it such that the / and /home mount points (which are different HD drives) are identical to those before, but such that at least the content of /home is preserved?
[12:28] <Combatjuan> niking, ramobo3, JEstre:  Thanks.
[12:29] <AlReece45> Icoo, make sure to compile ndiswrapper from source, the one in repositories didnt work for me.
[12:29] <cpl-tnt44> Kannix , yes . but i cant switch to hebrew mode for exsample in windows its alt+shift .
[12:29] <Combatjuan> Yay.  I butchered everyone's name.
[12:29] <AskHL> Type How -> Now
[12:29] <Icoo> AlReece45: well for me it's important that it worked on the new Edgy one 6.10
[12:29] <|rt|> anyone have any recommendations for rss readers?
[12:29] <nikin> AskHL: manualy partitiopning is good for that
[12:29] <Daviey> phanter, do pvcreate -M1 /dev/hdcX (or if it returns device not found use -M2)
[12:29] <nikin> just select the one containing /home not to be formated just mounted
[12:30] <TGPO> |rt| firefox does it right out of the box
[12:30] <cynical> AskHL: If you put an edgy cd in a computer with dapper installed, it actually lets you upgrade from that
[12:30] <|rt|> TGPO: yes but it doesn't archive items so things scroll off the list on active rss feeds
[12:30] <AlReece45> Icoo: well it worked for me on Edgy (I made the guide while on edgy)
[12:30] <AskHL> Thank you nikin
[12:30] <eegore> Is there any compelling reason to upgrade to Edgy  now that it has been released?
[12:30] <cynical> no
[12:30] <Icoo> AlReece45: OK I'm going to do it now, I will tell you if it worked
[12:30] <Daviey> phanter, are you still following?
[12:30] <Kannix> cpl-tnt44: right click into a toolbar, click on "add to panel", chose "utilities, keyboard indicator".
[12:31] <eegore> cynical: thanks for the info
[12:31] <jatt> Hmmm.... dash complains about the following construct
[12:31] <jatt>    if [ "${PPP_IPPARAM}" == "vpn_tunnel" ] ;
[12:31] <jatt> with the following error message
[12:31] <jatt>    [: 9: ==: unexpected operator
[12:31] <phanter> Daviey: yes I am, it is working up till now (after you before-last comment :))
[12:31] <TGPO> eegore yes, its the lemming principal, every ELSE is doing it ... near a bridge too :)
[12:31] <cynical> eegore: np
[12:31] <AskHL> cynical, that upgrade process -- will it be more stable than upgrading via the package managers? As I said, I've heard bad things about non-fresh installs so it would be best if it's a fresh install
[12:31] <Intangir> whats a good port scanning application?
[12:31] <Wilson> I have read the wiki on ubuntu but i still cannot figure out how to set it up as an ftp server
[12:31] <jatt> why? bash handles the if condition fine...
[12:31] <Intangir> Wilson: get proftpd
[12:31] <eegore> I may try is for my fourth 64 bit boot
[12:32] <cpl-tnt44> Kannix , Thanks that would help .. but i asked for the keyboard shortcut (like Alt+shift in windows ) , maybe i can build a key shortcut ?
[12:32] <Daviey> phanter, so you have pvcreated the next drive?
[12:32] <blazemonger> Are there any other linux distros similar to Ubuntu
[12:32] <cynical> AskHL: yes since you dont have to download anything. But personally I havent run into any problems upgrading from the net. But just to be safe backup your home directory so nothing can go wrong
[12:32] <phanter> Daviey: Now I get this error: sudo vgcreate vg2 /dev/evms/hdc1  \\  Physical volume /dev/evms/hdc1 is of different format type (lvm1)  \\  Unable to add physical volume '/dev/evms/hdc1' to volume group 'vg2'.
[12:32] <Wilson> Is it a pakage i can download or do i need to torrent it?
[12:32] <|rt|> Intangir: nmap
[12:32] <Intangir> Wilson: its a package
[12:32] <eegore> I seldom like to try anything bleeding edge for my production boot
[12:32] <Wilson> thank you man
[12:32] <phanter> Daviey: yes, the pvcreate worked
[12:32] <TGPO> blazemonger debian, its what ubuntu is based off of
[12:32] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell LeeJunFan_away about away
[12:32] <Intangir> Wilson: you will have to add all the other repositories though
[12:32] <AskHL> cynical, thank you very much. I'm already copying it :)
[12:32] <Tatey> any idea on why the /dev/mdX nodes aren't being created?
[12:32] <blazemonger> TGPO: i kno
[12:32] <Daviey> phanter, you want two volume groups?  if you want one.. use vgextend
[12:33] <Tatey> on my system
[12:33] <blazemonger> but are there any ubuntu based distros
[12:33] <cynical> AsKHL: np :D
[12:33] <Wilson> ????Repositories
[12:33] <Intangir> Wilson: in synaptic goto the repositories option , and check on a bunch of those repos
[12:33] <blazemonger> how do you make your own live cd distro like for specific tasks
[12:33] <Intangir> Wilson: then refresh, then search for proftpd
[12:33] <phanter> Daviey: one volume group... so now i do: sudo vgextend vg /dev/evms/hdc1  ???
[12:33] <Wilson> ok lemme take my laptop to my ubuntu machine
[12:33] <Icoo> AlReece45: and the first problem...Ndiswrapper is now 1.28 (October 29 2006) but I need the 1.23 one (I guess) because in the guide it said that 1.25 didn't worked...where can i get 1.23
[12:33] <Daviey> phanter, yes
[12:33] <TGPO> blazemonger xubuntu, kubuntu, edubuntu, flubuntu (I think is officially released)
[12:33] <cpl-tnt44> Kannix , Thanks that would help .. but i asked for the keyboard shortcut (like Alt+shift in windows ) , maybe i can build a key shortcut ?
[12:34] <nikin> i ame installing Dapper Server. what packages i need to run an Xserver with Windowmaker or IceWM?
[12:34] <Icoo> AlReece45: found it
[12:34] <phanter> Daviey: I again get the error: Physical volume /dev/evms/hdc1 is of different format type (lvm1)  \\  Unable to add physical volume '/dev/evms/hdc1' to volume group 'vg'.
[12:34] <cpl-tnt44> how do i upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 ? and if its recommanded ?
[12:34] <phanter> Daviey: do you know what that means ?
[12:34] <blazemonger> you can download a server version and make a customized ubuntu?
[12:34] <AlReece45> Icoo:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482&package_id=99148
[12:34] <AlReece45> Icoo: ehh
[12:34] <cens0red> how do I check what apps are using what ports?
[12:34] <TGPO> nikin xorg xorg-server-core and then whatever WM you want
[12:34] <nikin> TGPO: ty
[12:35] <morgue> Why am I not getting "set as wallpaper" on firefox when I right click on pictures?
[12:35] <phanter> Daviey: is it not formatted in the right way (lvm2 or something)
[12:35] <withaY> how can you associate a protocol in gnome?  for instance, a page in firfox has a url of stuff://things.com and i want to associate the stuff:// protocol to an app.
[12:35] <blazemonger> the one difference i've noticed is some packages in debian are more stable
[12:35] <Daviey> phanter, could be lvm1 & 2 are different.  As a side note, are you going over 256gig?
[12:35] <Kannix> cpl-tnt44: well, browse through the options in "gconf-editor".
[12:35] <rbil> cens0red: cat /etc/services
[12:35] <blazemonger> what is lvm?
[12:35] <TGPO> blazemonger you bet, ubuntu doesnt test as stringently as debian
[12:35] <phanter> Daviey: no, just 150 gig
[12:36] <Wilson> ok and with this i can create usernames for the FTP?
[12:36] <Daviey> phanter, good.  It's 23:36 here so i can't hang around much longer.
[12:36] <cens0red> port 5699 is in use by another program. How do I check what's using it?
[12:36] <phanter> Daviey: but yes, the otehr partition was in lvm2, how come I have different lvm versions there :s
[12:36] <Intangir> some clown has been trying to log into me as root for weeks
[12:36] <Intangir> i just checked my logs and noticed ;)
[12:36] <Wilson> lol
[12:36] <phanter> Daviey: I understand... I will try a bit more and go to bed as well
[12:36] <Intangir> and i think i have root logons disabled all together
[12:37] <Intangir> so he has absolutely no chance of getting in
[12:37] <Chousuke> Intangir: I get that a lot too :P
[12:37] <Chousuke> Intangir: with random usernames too
[12:37] <Chousuke> it's common I suppose.
[12:37] <Intangir> t
[12:37] <Intangir> oops
[12:37] <morgue> Hi, I have a logitech webcam which has a microphone, on Skype it's working but when I try to record something using Ubuntu Sound Recorder all I get is silence... any suggestions?
[12:37] <Intangir> ya i just read an article on digg about securing ssh
[12:37] <Intangir> and decided to have a look ;)
[12:38] <Chousuke> I don't even keep SSH on all the time :P
[12:38] <withaY> Intangir and Chousuke, through ssh they're trying to log in?
[12:38] <Chousuke> withaY: yes.
[12:38] <Daviey> phanter, not sure.  Can we get this single lvm part finished? you need to create the filesystem.  Use this "mke2fs -j -O sparse_super -m0 -i8000000 -L NAMEOFSTORAGE /dev/vg/storage
[12:38] <Icoo> AlReece45: problem...I downloaded the surce, untared it, got into the folder via terminal, typed make (worked fine), then I typed install and it says Install: missing file operand
[12:38] <Wilson> intangir! With this ftp setup can i add username and login for people or is it just 1?
[12:38] <lollan> Hi I am looking for a .deb for the software IDEA (java IDE)
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[12:39] <ianmacgregor> !idea
[12:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about idea - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:39] <Daviey> phanter, not sure.  Can we get this single lvm part finished? you need to create the filesystem.  Use this to create ext3 "mke2fs -j -O sparse_super -m0 -i8000000 -L datalvm /dev/vg/datalvm"
[12:39] <Intangir> Wilson: with that ftp , you just add users to your linux box, and they automatically get to ftp to their home
[12:39] <phanter> Daviey: hmm, I will first play around to get the second disk in it as well... then I will sleep and see about the fs tomorrow... That way you go to bed without feeling bad (LOL) and I can go to bed in a minute as well
[12:39] <Intangir> theres an option in the config file to make it so they cant browse outside of their home directory
[12:39] <slinky_> when I right click on a file in Nautilus, i get two entries in the popup menu saying "Open with Rhythmbox" and after uninstalling Rhythmbox I still get one entry, any help?
[12:39] <mikedoty> Anyone here happen to use Opera?
[12:39] <mabus> how do you modify what environment variable start up for users? like if I wanted ~/bin to be in the path of all users
[12:39] <Daviey> phanter, make a note of that command tho
[12:40] <phanter> Daviey: I have all of it logged anyway (i love gaim) so i can look at it tomorrow as well
[12:40] <Intangir> Wilson: its called DefaultRoot
[12:40] <Wilson> ok so as long as they have a machine user they can ftp that so i can create 1 user for ftp and just add all files i want for ftp there
[12:40] <Intangir> Wilson: set it to ~ (DefaultRoot ~)
[12:40] <Intangir> then users who log in can only see their home directory
[12:40] <withaY> anyone happen to know how to associate a protocol scheme (for instance, http:// or ftp://) to a particular application?
[12:40] <Intangir> also you can do like this DefaultRoot ~ !intangir, then users can only see home, except i will be able to see everything ;)
[12:40] <Kannix> cpl-tnt44: still having problems finding the keyboard layout switch keybinding?
[12:41] <Intangir> withaY: there is a services file
[12:41] <Daviey> phanter, okay you can easily resize the filesystem.
[12:41] <Intangir> /etc/services
[12:41] <withaY> slinky_, you might wanna look through /usr/share/applications to make sure that there aren't 2 rhythmbox.desktop files in there.
[12:41] <Daviey> phanter, anyway good night
[12:41] <Wilson> so type that u just typed
[12:41] <Daviey> Good Night All!!
[12:41] <mirak> hi
[12:41] <phanter> Daviey: thank you very much... and sleep well
[12:41] <mirak> how does work the hibernation mode ?
[12:41] <cbx33> Anyone know about hardware conflicts?
[12:41] <mirak> it doesn't seems to work
[12:41] <lollan> thanks ubotu
[12:41] <cbx33> I think my sound card is conflicting with my usb?
[12:41] <cbx33> is that possible?
[12:41] <bense> resolved the issue with DNS taking forever to resolve
[12:41] <bense> :)
[12:41] <cens0red> I'm getting so many zombie processes with the new ubuntu.
[12:41] <mirak> lollan: it's ubuto
[12:41] <slinky_> withaY: i'll try that
[12:41] <Icoo> AlReece45: problem...I downloaded the surce, untared it, got into the folder via terminal, typed make (worked fine), then I typed install and it says Install: missing file operand
[12:42] <Intangir> CUPS is for printing right?
[12:42] <lollan> cbx33: I don't think so
[12:42] <Intangir> this guys printer port is open to the internet, i wonder if i can print off of it?
[12:42] <lollan> mirak: ok lol sorry
[12:42] <nikin> its "make install"
[12:42] <Intangir> this is the guy whos trying to hack me: 58.61.39.98
[12:42] <Intangir> hes online now ;)
[12:42] <mikedoty> I'm having problems with tab cycling with my mouse in Opera.  Scroll up moves to the next tab instead of the previous tab.  (Mouse wheel works as expected in all other things I've tried.)  Anyone have an idea of a resolution?
[12:42] <Intangir> hes got ssh, rpcbind, and ipp open
[12:42] <withaY> Intangir, the /etc/services?  i don't think that's the one i want.  for example, i want to click on a lastfm:// link in firefox, but there's no application currently associated with that protocol scheme.
[12:42] <nikin> Intangir: try to hack him :D
[12:42] <morgue> Why am I not getting "set as wallpaper" on firefox when I right click on pictures?
[12:42] <Intangir> withaY: oh i dont know how to do that
[12:43] <Intangir> nikin: i would but, i dont know how ;)
[12:43] <AlReece45> Icoo: looking real quick, give me anohter minute
[12:43] <nikin> Intangir: first try to find where he is
[12:43] <Intangir> what is rpcbind for?
[12:43] <clahey> Is there a magic way to upgrade my ubuntu box to eft?
[12:43] <mirak> how does work the hibernation mode ?
[12:43] <mirak> it doesn't seems to work
[12:43] <Intangir> nikin: hes in china!
[12:43] <Icoo> AlReece45: THX trying to solve it too...I installed the build-essentials
[12:43] <Intangir> chinese hackers are attacking me ;)
[12:43] <Intangir> hahahaha
[12:44] <TGPO> ubotu, please tell clahey about upgrade
[12:44] <Icoo> AlReece45: I installed them right after edgy...so I don't know whats missing
[12:44] <eegore> Intangir: why would they attack you?
[12:44] <withaY> you can't say that definitively.  there are lots of anon. proxies in china that people route through.
[12:44] <nikin> Intangir: bad luck... they have the permission of the goverment, or atleast the goverment dont do nothing against them
[12:44] <cbx33> lollan what could be causing it
[12:44] <Intangir> eegore: im just playing, i think he is running some sorta script that just searches whole IP ranges for open ssh ports, and tries to bruteforce in
[12:44] <cbx33> the mouse and keyboard are practically unusable....
[12:45] <clahey> It is a bit of a bug that the software updates app tells me it's available and sends me to www.ubuntulinux.org for upgrade instructions.  I go there and there are no instructions.
[12:45] <cbx33> moving the mouse is so laggy...and it's all since I put in a soundcard
[12:45] <cpl-tnt44> what is the commmand showing the current version of ubuntu installed ?
[12:45] <eegore> Intangir: a very sloppy tactic
[12:45] <Intangir> nikin: well they dont do much about it anywhere
[12:45] <Vexxer91> SonicvanaJr
[12:45] <Vexxer91> SonicvanaJr
[12:45] <clahey> That message should probably display the correct URL.
[12:45] <Intangir> eegore: i cant think of any other reason why someone from china would be trying to log into my machine ;)
[12:45] <Wilson> intangir.. do i get all the packages found for proftpd?
[12:45] <lollan> cbx33: you have no sound, that's it ?
[12:45] <Intangir> Wilson: just get the proftpd one , and whatever dependancies it has
[12:45] <cpl-tnt44> what is the commmand showing the current version of ubuntu installed ?
[12:45] <Vexxer91> SonicvanaJr? You there Mr?
[12:45] <eegore> Maybe the Russian mob looking for a spam machine?
[12:45] <cbx33> lollan no I have sound
[12:45] <nikin> Intangir: thats kinda true
[12:46] <cbx33> but the keyboard and mouse don;t work properly
[12:46] <SonicvanaJr> Vexxer91, hey
[12:46] <Wilson> there is like 8 that say proftpd!!!!!!!!!!!!11
[12:46] <Intangir> hrm let me have a loot
[12:46] <Vexxer91> How's it goin buddy?
[12:46] <Intangir> look
[12:46] <slinky_> withaY: I checked there is only ony entry for Rhythmbox, it is like a type/application has been defined twice somewhere, one never got deleted during a complete uninstall
[12:46] <blazemonger> ;5~;5~;5~;5~;5~;5~is Debian more stable than Ubuntu?
[12:46] <TGPO> cpl-tnt44 its edgy
[12:46] <cbx33> lollan any ideas?
[12:46] <withaY> slinky_, ugh.  pita.  umm....
[12:46] <AlReece45> Icoo: Do you have the kernel source installed?
[12:46] <cpl-tnt44> TGPO , what's edgy ?
[12:46] <lollan> cbx33: did you have sound before ?
[12:46] <LjL> blazemonger, no. yes. maybe. not the right place to wonder about that.
[12:47] <Icoo> AlReece45: kernel source?
[12:47] <TGPO> cpl-tnt44 or to see what you have been using 'cat /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:47] <lollan> cbx33: I mean you didn't just install ubuntu ?
[12:47] <cpl-tnt44> TGPO i think u'v confusing me ...
[12:47] <cbx33> lollan I didnt have a soundcard before
[12:47] <cbx33> I installed ubuntu
[12:47] <cbx33> was allworking fine
[12:47] <Intangir> Wilson: get the one named 'proftpd'
[12:47] <Intangir> thats it
[12:47] <cpl-tnt44> TGPO i asked how do i chk my current ubuntu version
[12:47] <cbx33> then I put asound card in now it doesn't work properly
[12:48] <Intangir> then edit /etc/proftpd.conf, change DefaultRoot to ~
[12:48] <cpl-tnt44> and how i upgrade it ?
[12:48] <TGPO> cpl-tnt44 that will tell you the version that you have been using for package management
[12:48] <Intangir> then your good i gotta go
[12:48] <Intangir> laters people
[12:48] <Kannix> cpl-tnt44: "uname -a"
[12:48] <Wilson> ok thanks
[12:48] <eegore> cynical: I might throw in another hardrive this week and play around with it
[12:48] <Kubu> how can i se ethe temperature of my cpu?
[12:48] <Kubu> through ubuntu
[12:48] <lollan> cbx33: I think you need to add the support for your sound card
[12:48] <slinky_> withaY: also when i double click to play an mp3 it says mp3 document when file content is mp3 audio
[12:48] <eegore> With the abilitiy to have eight drives, what the hell
[12:48] <TGPO> uname -a doesnt list version
[12:48] <cpl-tnt44> thanks kanix
[12:48] <AlReece45> try doing  sudo apt-get install linux-source-`uname -r` and them aking again
[12:48] <cynical> eegore: good idea, personally I havent noticed a big difference. Shutdown times are a lot faster but I rarely do that anyway. I guess just having updated software like firefox 2, not that you couldnt do that in dapper anyway
[12:49] <Wilson> i can use no-ip duc for my ip to aaccess my server right?
[12:49] <AlReece45> Icoo: try doing  sudo apt-get install linux-source-`uname -r`and making again
[12:49] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[12:49] <Abst> Any one know how to fix this that happened after installing nvidia?
[12:49] <Abst> http://img.waffleimages.com/8c064d108c672462db94b25498af09e9ae10ded7/screen.png
[12:49] <TGPO> not is "edgy" "breezy" ect format
[12:49] <cbx33> lollan the kernel should pick up the driver
[12:49] <Icoo> AlReece45: I installed them right after edgy...so I don't know whats missin
[12:49] <cbx33> the sound now works fine
[12:49] <cbx33> no lag at all

[01:19] <jokoon> aoupi : see what cynical just said :)
[01:19] <Kannix> nikin: well, a netmask alone is no help. You need to know the network as well.

[01:19] <jokoon> thanks cynical
[01:19] <aoupi> jokoon: :)
[01:19] <LjL> cmcrae: perhaps that could be because it's not quite a question that makes much sense. soundcards usually work out of the box. if you have a problem, you should state which problem, and which card, and the relevant information.

[01:19] <AlReece45> icoo: yeah :)

[01:20] <ut2004> can someone help me im tring to set up my linux box as a gateway using 2 nic cards
[01:20] <Kannix> nikin: Are you in a home environment and just toying around or is this in a professional environment?
[01:20] <Hobbin> Georgy: What do you suggest reading?
[01:20] <AlReece45> icoo: you can probably remove them now, though you should probably keep gcc4.3

[01:21] <btb103> I am getting a Fatal server error: no screens detected! when I try to boot/install ubuntu live. It seems to be having trouble detecting my radeon x850xt does anyone know what I can do to troubleshoot this?
[01:22] <Kannix> nikin: if you screw up the config of that server, are you likely to take down a whole company, or just your own server in your bedroom?
[01:22] <asc_> I just upgraded to Edgy, and it won't start the x server.  The error message is "could not open default font "fixed".  Any ideas how to resolve it?
[01:22] <Kannix> nikin: ok, which IP is that?
[01:22] <LjL> asc_: how did you upgrade?
[01:22] <nikin> Kannix: its a toy server :D

[01:22] <asc_> LjL: 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' from Dapper.
[01:22] <Hobbin> Georgy: Good idea, I should probably read all about it before I do anything
[01:22] <Kannix> nikin: Since DHCP is not working and times out, have you checked your cable?
[01:22] <joshritger> does anyone know how to setup a network bridge from a windows computer to xubuntu?
[01:23] <LjL> !upgrade | asc_, well, that was not the best way

[01:23] <ut2004> i dont understand
[01:23] <nikin> yes i checked but do it again
[01:23] <LjL> asc_: anyway, i'd try running "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" (or "kubuntu-desktop" if you're using kubuntu, or whatever applies)
[01:23] <georgy> Hobbin : when you install it, then you can begin with the other services

[01:24] <kevu> how do i tell a program to start on start up?
[01:24] <AlReece45> rothgar, you there?
[01:24] <tam> can someone recommend a good mail client that will forward on a particular template given when a mail comes in with specific charetaristics? it can't be thunderbird tho
[01:24] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell kevu about startup
[01:24] <rothgar> yes
[01:24] <nikin> Kannix: this cable worked about 20 hoours ago
[01:24] <CptBrutal> is it normal for xmms to freeze on some streams?
[01:24] <nikin> so it should work

[01:24] <keifer> Can anyone think of why I wouldn't get a connection via a ethernet hub in edgy/dapper, while the same device works in breezy?
[01:25] <Hobbin> Georgy: My plan is to make a website, and then a FTP server
[01:25] <asc_> LjL: well, we do live and learn.  Ah... I just remembered that apt-get upgrade says it's holding back about fifty x-related packages.  Know of a handy command that might cause them to install?
[01:25] <Kannix> nikin: well, that is, unless someone tripped over it, the cat had a go at it, you yanked it while toying with the router, etc.
[01:25] <kruncher> has anyone else had problems with k3b not getting the cddb entry when copying a music cd?
[01:25] <asc_> LjL: (if you don't, I'll try ubuntu-desktop as recommended)
[01:25] <LjL> asc_: ouch. do you have any third-party repositories enabled?
[01:25] <AlReece45> rothgar, I have the nvidia go 6150, and the nvidia-glx driver in the repository didn't work with it, I think its the same with the 6200, you need to install the beta nvidia driver if you want to use it
[01:25] <georgy> btb103,: do in the terminal sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and choice vesa driver for your card
[01:25] <iratsu> if i want to make a fresh install of ubuntu server on a server, should i use 6.06 LTS or 6.10?
[01:25] <btb103> thx georgy
[01:26] <georgy> Hobbin : then you have to install apache2 and proftpd
[01:26] <nikin> Kannix: just a sec i test it with other PC
[01:26] <fatlip> is there a repo for audio formats like m4a?
[01:26] <LjL> iratsu: as the name says, 6.06 has Long Time Support, so it might be a better choice for a server in the long run
[01:26] <asc_> LjL: No.
[01:26] <rothgar> AlReece45: thanks for the tip, how can I get to a terminal though to install the beta driver?
[01:26] <jokoon> Why Totem reads a file (double click) but dropping it on rythmnbox doesnt make it appear ?
[01:26] <kevu> Llj: but it's a c program aka terminal app, not gui one.
[01:26] <LjL> asc_: well, can you run "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" and post the full output to the pastebin please?
[01:26] <AlReece45> rothgar, also when x doesn't start, you can go to a terminal by using CTRL+ALT+F(1-6)
[01:26] <btb103> how do i choose a vesa driver?
[01:26] <iratsu> LjL: so what does long term support imply?
[01:26] <LjL> kevu: what sort of thing, exactly?
[01:26] <boricua> 5 years of update

[01:27] <icoo> AlReece45:  ok got till step 4, i installed the driver but when typing "ndiswrapper -l" i get invalid driver

[01:37] <TGPO> icoo AlReece on another note, the method described at http://bcm43xx.berlios.de is much better than ndiswrapper
[01:38] <AlReece45> TGPO, I did that at first, but for one, this card isnt' supported. Another reason is that I can't go faster than 20Kbps on it
[01:38] <icoo> this is what I found

[01:44] <icoo> it asked me if I'm root the first time so i figured out i need sudo, so yes I used sudo
[01:44] <LjL> kevu: and ubuntu has root (as in having a superuser). it's just that you can't directly access the "root" account, and you use sudo instead
[01:45] <btb103> georgy: i chose vesa this time and my monitor went blank and into powersave mode

[01:45] <case1> Does anybody in here know where I could get some help with RRD ?
[01:45] <LjL> kevu: you should move the script, and run the chown and chmod commands, now. in /etc/rc.local you simply run the script

=== Linuturk is now known as Linuturk_zZz
[01:46] <georgy> btb103, : *high
[01:46] <LjL> kevu: right
[01:46] <icoo> TGP0: did you look at the list
[01:46] <TGPO> icoo here's the link http://ftp.us.dell.com/network/R115321.EXE
[01:46] <case1> is anyone in here fam. w/ flowscan ?
[01:46] <hckrSid> Hi all... just installed edgy... now if I connect an external monitor (or projector) to the laptop, it displays only on the external monitor.
[01:46] <btb103> georgy: sync range was auto-detected, i used that and verified it online
[01:46] <hckrSid> Anyone have this issue?
[01:47] <hckrSid> I have an ATI radeon card, using the "ati" xorg driver.
[01:47] <icoo> TGP0: DEll? I have a HP
[01:47] <case1> hckrSid: are you sure it isn't bios settings on your lappy?
[01:47] <kevu> LjL: ok thank you!
[01:47] <Ktio> hi
[01:47] <hckrSid> case1, it used to work fine on dapper.
[01:47] <georgy> btb103 : sorry, out of idea
[01:47] <case1> hckrSid: strange
[01:47] <Ktio> anyone knows a good prog for dvb viewing ?
[01:47] <TGPO> your matching the the system address, its the same manufacturer of the chipset your using
[01:48] <TGPO> who made your laptop doesnt mean squat
[01:48] <hckrSid> case1, it displayed on both screens... also now on edgy as soon as I connect an external monitor it logs out and gives me a login screen.
[01:48] <newbuntie> what would cause some of my file system to disappear and other parts to remain?
[01:48] <btb103> georgy: thanks for trying, now when i run install it uses that x config i made and it goes automatically to powersave mode
[01:48] <ihatetripe> Oh lordy, could someone please help me with this problem, it's driving me bonkers. ssh is not working in nautilus. I am getting the "Please select another viewer and try again." error. I have installed ssh-askpass-gnome and it still does not work
[01:48] <case1> hckrSid: sorry man, i have no idea
[01:49] <hckrSid> case1, thanks anyways.
[01:49] <Ktio> what is equavalent ofr progdvb in linux ?
[01:49] <georgy> btb103 : you can install it in text mode
[01:49] <case1> can someone suggest the best networking channels on here?
[01:50] <case1> looking for some help with flowscan
[01:50] <ihatetripe> Ktio, I use Kaffiene
[01:50] <btb103> georgy: do you have a link describing how to do that?
[01:50] <newbuntie> any idea how parts of my filesystem could disappear after a tv card installation and how I could get them back?
[01:51] <Ktio> ihatetripe i use kaffeine too but bot satisfied, i want something like progdvb that uses plugins such as vPlugin
[01:51] <Ktio> bot=not
[01:51] <newbuntie> is there anyway to try to retrieve lost files?
[01:51] <Ktio> I wonder why there are no good dvb viewers for linux :(
[01:52] <ihatetripe> Ktio, I know what you mean. If you find a good one let me know :)
[01:52] <TGPO> whats a dvb?
[01:52] <mortal5> where does mplayer store its codecs, isn't it /usr/lib/win32?
[01:52] <jadacyrus> I can't write to my floppy disk. Its telling me its a read-only file system. How do I change the permissions so I can write to it again?
[01:52] <Ktio> dvb=Digital Video broadcasting .. i.e. satellite cards
[01:53] <newbuntie> let's ask a really simple question, can anyone see me type?
[01:53] <TGPO> jadacyrus add yourself to the group, its in user management
[01:53] <jadacyrus> user management..
[01:53] <TGPO> newbuntie yes
[01:53] <jadacyrus> okay
[01:53] <fatlip> i cant find how to playback m4a on edgy... which library do i need from the repo for the aac codec?
[01:54] <newbuntie> good, i guess
[01:54] <paolo> a friend of mine has a problem with 6.10, if he plug his mp3 player ubuntu automount it with read onyl permission. Any idea?
[01:54] <jadacyrus> TGPO: what group do i have to add myself to?
[01:54] <jadacyrus> under mount it says user=alex, thats me
[01:54] <TGPO> jada, let me look real quick
[01:54] <jadacyrus> still wont let me write.
[01:54] <jadacyrus> rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=alex
[01:55] <georgy> btb103 : no, but watch at google
[01:55] <kevu> LjL: but if i chown it to root, then if i log in as kevu, will it get executed?
[01:55] <mortal5> where does mplayer store its codecs, isn't it /usr/lib/win32?
[01:55] <azureal> wow! what did edgy do to my etc/fstab
[01:55] <Linuturk_zZz> how can I force a fschk on the next reboot?
[01:55] <azureal> i just noticede the horror
[01:55] <paolo> a friend of mine has a problem with 6.10, if he plug his mp3 player ubuntu automount it with read onyl permission. Any idea?
[01:55] <TGPO> jada, I dont have the group for that ... not having a floppy drive
[01:55] <jvai> would sound recorder make a good stream ripper?
[01:56] <jadacyrus> heh
[01:56] <jadacyrus> i mean, under my fstab it says rw
[01:56] <baastrup> my boot lig gives me this error: Loading hardware drivers...                             error receiving uevent message: No buffer space available
[01:56] <TGPO> jada can you go root and use it?
[01:57] <azureal> edgy randomly converted all my /dev/sda* !?
[01:57] <LjL> kevu: yes, since it'll get executed by root, at boot time, before you even log in
[01:57] <jrib> mortal5: /usr/lib/codecs/ now or the corresponding in /usr/local, though win32 should still work
[01:57] <TGPO> azureal, thats physical addressing your seeing, did the same thing to my sataII drives
[01:57] <jadacyrus> TGPO: nope.. :-(
[01:57] <kevu> LjL: oh ok makes sense now
[01:57] <LjL> !info testdisk | newbuntie
[01:57] <jadacyrus> hmm
[01:57] <ubotu> testdisk: Partition scanner and disk recovery tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 6.4.1-1 (edgy), package size 459 kB, installed size 1232 kB
[01:57] <jadacyrus> i have an idea one sec
[01:57] <TGPO> kk
[01:58] <LjL> newbuntie: there are also other programs (type "apt-cache search undel"), but i'm afraid they only work on ext2
=== panic_ is now known as Arr0w
[01:58] <azureal> TGPO, why would you want that?  speed?
[01:58] <AlReece45> TGPO, that might have been the same card, but the drivers are different (the .sys files)
[01:58] <case1> anyone in here fam. w/ setting up flowscan?
[01:58] <azureal> TGPO, cause it's ugly as hell
[01:58] <LjL> kevu: make sure the script isn't buggy, since it's going to have root privileges.
[01:58] <fatlip> long island in the house!
[01:59] <case1> anyone in here fam. w/ setting up flowscan?  I'm having a heck of a time setting it up and getting my round robin databases working (RRD).
[01:59] <TGPO> azureal, I have been trying to figure that out (and how to mount my other SATAII) for 3 weeks now, let me know if you find out why its using physical addressing
[01:59] <Linuturk_zZz> TGPO, I'd like to know too azureal ;p
[01:59] <Linuturk_zZz> it does look nasty
[02:00] <azureal> i want to vomit
[02:00] <azureal> i opened it just now and almost died of shock
[02:00] <AlReece45> icoo: i think remove the driver from ndiswrapper restart and try again, maybe i forgot to include something that needs to be loaded.
[02:00] <meheren> does anyone no how to set xdm to boot xfce not gnome?
[02:01] <icoo> AlReece45:  how do i remove it, I'm just downlaoding the Dell drivers that TGP0 sugested
[02:01] <mortal5> how can i check the codecs directory my mplayer was compiled with?
[02:01] <LjL> meheren: i don't use xdm (i use kdm), but i suppose there is a "Session" menu
[02:01] <baastrup> does anyone know how to get rid of: hw_random: cannot enable RNG error
[02:02] <LjL> baastrup: dunno, try something random
[02:02] <ivx> hey i am trying to use vsftpd to setup multiple ftp accounts that will all upload to different directories. does anyone know how to set that up in the config file?
[02:02] <meheren> LjL, xdm has no menu's on it's greeter
[02:02] <AlReece45> icoo, I believe sudo
[02:02] <AlReece45> icoo, 'sudo ndiswrapper -e bcmwl5' should do it
[02:02] <TGPO> azureal lets ask :)
[02:03] <TGPO> can anyone tell me why this is this way in /etc/fstab? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29636/
[02:03] <icoo> AlReece45: did it, now I will wait for the dload to finish
[02:03] <LjL> TGPO: what's wrong with it?
=== Pierre_ is now known as Pierre
[02:04] <TGPO> you see the UUID?
[02:04] <azureal> LjL, i agree w/ TGPO, it sucks
[02:04] <AlReece45> icoo: k
[02:04] <azureal> well, at the least it's scary
[02:04] <TGPO> how the heck do you determine that?
[02:05] <LjL> TGPO, it's been done so that drives are referred to by an unique identifier, rather than by their device name (/dev/whatever), which changes depending on which slot you connect the drive to
[02:05] <azureal> is this the only distro that's currently doing this?!
[02:05] <LjL> TGPO: this way, moving drives around should have less nasty effects
[02:06] <LjL> azureal: dunno
[02:06] <maxflax> Anyone having the knowledge of LIRC how to compile and such.. keep getting errors when doing the make
[02:06] <TGPO> LjL are you aware of any place where we can manually determine that? makes it impossible to add more drives
[02:06] <LjL> !uuid
[02:06] <ubotu> To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid"
[02:06] <TGPO> ah
[02:06] <fatlip> long island in the house!
[02:06] <fatlip> whoops
[02:06] <fatlip> pasted the wrong one lol
[02:06] <shadowhywind> is apt-get clean and autoclean safe to run?
[02:06] <meheren> how do a reconfigure a package?
[02:06] <fatlip> i cant find how to playback m4a on edgy... which library do i need from the repo for the aac codec?
[02:06] <fatlip> there we go
[02:07] <LjL> meheren: sudo dpkg-reconfigure <package>
[02:07] <LjL> shadowhywind: yes
[02:07] <shadowhywind> thanks
[02:07] <shadowhywind> my apt folder has 2.2 gbs, hehe
[02:07] <meheren> LjL, ah... all this time i've been doing sudo dpkg --configure <package>

[02:10] <hangfire_> Kannix- and then what?
[02:10] <jadacyrus> i have a .IMG file, I can use the dd command to write its contents to a floppy, but I want to write its contents to a folder on my desktop, when I try of=/home/user/Desktop/folder , it just recreates the IMG file...isntead of the contents of it
[02:10] <AlReece45> icoo: odd, I tried the dell drivers first and they hated me ;P
[02:11] <icoo> AlReece45:  damn those idiots at Broadcom for not puting out Linux drivers...well let's go to step 5

[02:12] <PR006> phaedrus44, konqueror or epiphany
[02:12] <AlReece45> icoo: oh btw, if you get them installed, upgrading to 1.28 is very simple, just sudo make, sudo make uninstall, sudo make install, and then the connections % is actually not 100%
[02:12] <LjL> kronoman: yes
[02:12] <PR006> kronoman, yes, jou can

[02:12] <Kannix> hangfire_: +add to panel
[02:12] <VonGuard> hello
[02:12] <LjL> kronoman: you should set both swap partitions to the same priority in /etc/fstab, so that they will be load balanced

[02:12] <PR006> kronoman, its, the question, if it makes sense
[02:13] <Kannix> hangfire_: custom application launcher
[02:13] <LjL> PR006: most definitely does
[02:13] <nikin> what are the base packages you need to run X ?
[02:13] <Kannix> hangfire_: "nautilus" is the application
[02:13] <VonGuard> i have installed and gotten xmame working on Dapper. But now, when i hit escape to quit out while running a game, gnome crashes out
[02:13] <VonGuard> spits me back to login
[02:13] <nikin> i have installed xserver-xorg-core
[02:13] <VonGuard> any ideas?
[02:13] <elyezer> how i install anjuta2.0.2??
[02:13] <hangfire_> Thanks Kannix , thats what I need to know
[02:13] <TGPO> nikin did you also install xorg?
[02:13] <phaedrus44> gftp doesnt run on my ubuntu install
[02:13] <nikin> there was no such package
[02:13] <phaedrus44> freeezes
[02:14] <aoupi> nikin: do you want the entire desktop like gnome and stuff? in that case install ubuntu-desktop
[02:14] <VonGuard> i can't for the life of me think of why gxmame would cause gnome to quit
[02:14] <nikin> nono.. just X and windowmaker
[02:14] <VonGuard> it runs the games fine

[02:14] <TGPO> nikin ???? was there the other day ... you need xorg
[02:14] <VonGuard> nevermind the joystick issues i'm having
[02:14] <icoo> AlReece45:  got it, I see the card in networking...what now?
[02:14] <nikin> RGPO: i tryed apt-get install xorg .. and it didnt find the package
[02:15] <LjL> Chippy: right click
[02:15] <TGPO> nikin, there is a way that "MIGHT" work
[02:15] <LjL> Chippy: at least i think. or there should be a menu editor somewhere in the menu itself.

[02:16] <georgy> nikin : x-window-system-core
[02:16] <kronoman> thanks for the swap tip, I don't know if it makes sense to have both, but well, since I don't want to repartion the old drive, I could use both just for the sake of it

[02:17] <iratsu> do i want to use bluetooth-gnome or bluez-utils for bluetooth?
[02:17] <ianmacgregor> TGPO: It's not a good idea to be installing debian packages in Ubuntu
[02:17] <LjL> TGPO: ouch, that *will* not might break things
[02:17] <Chippy> LjL: there is, but that doesn't let me add custom stuff, only let's me add things that it then installs via apt-get
[02:17] <AlReece45> icoo, try installing network-manager-gnome, its pretty good
[02:17] <TGPO> I'v pulled it off once or twice, but like I said its a haorrible idea
[02:17] <AlReece45> icoo, i'll brb again
[02:18] <D00B3Y> anyone?
[02:18] <LjL> TGPO, one thing is installing a single Debian package using dpkg - which, as ianmacgregor said, is still dangerous -- an entirely different thing is putting the whole Debian repository into sources.list. at the first apt-get command, all sorts of weird stuff will get installed
[02:18] <D00B3Y> Buffer I/O error on device hda... any ideas?!!
[02:19] <AlReece45> icoo, i guess taht didn't d/c me
[02:19] <georgy> D00B3Y, : run fsck to repair it
[02:19] <TGPO> LjL, like I said, its a hail mary go for broke
[02:19] <D00B3Y> it's when I boot the live CD though, can't run fsck when linux is running
[02:19] <icoo> AlReece45:  got it, I see the card in networking...what now?
[02:20] <icoo> AlReece45:  sorry
[02:20] <nikin> LjL: it is still good for a befora-the-last-option thing.. the last option is to get a pickaxe and smash the whole thing in to molecules
[02:20] <Kannix> Is anyone using edgy in the AMD64 version? I am experiencing graphics problems on bootup. The ubuntu-logo is b/w and the throbber is screwed up. Everything is fine once gdm kicks in, though.
[02:20] <icoo> AlReece45:  well I installed network-manager-gnome...but where is the damn thing
[02:20] <TIger_IT> D00B3Y: have U used hdparm reciently ?
[02:20] <D00B3Y> no
[02:20] <D00B3Y> I dont even know what it is..
[02:20] <TGPO> kannix, got the same problem ... top end nvidia card?
[02:20] <Kannix> TGPO: Yep. 7900.
[02:20] <D00B3Y> how do I check what device is hdc?
[02:20] <TIger_IT> D00B3Y: ahh...
[02:21] <icoo> AlReece45:  I can't find any icon for it
[02:21] <LjL> nikin: alright, anyway, if you do that, make *very* sure that apt-get will *only* install the stuff you want from the Debian reps, and if you see anything like "libc" mentioned, DON'T go for it. and when you're finished installing, remove the Debian repository from your sources.list, and issue a sudo apt-get update
[02:21] <TGPO> Kannix cause it doesnt know what the card is
[02:21] <TIger_IT> D00B3Y:  is the CD-ROM
[02:21] <D00B3Y> k
[02:21] <D00B3Y> what's wrong with it?
[02:21] <TGPO> Kannix it doesnt know my 7950 either
[02:21] <D00B3Y> well I know it's fucked up.. but can I do anything to fix it?
[02:21] <Kannix> TGPO: But isn't it using framebuffer in VESA mode anyhow?
[02:21] <nikin> LjL: be sure i will try everything before doing that :D
[02:21] <AlReece45> icoo, it should start automatically on your next login, but running 'nm-applet --sm-disable' should open it

[02:22] <D00B3Y> what does it to?
[02:22] <mortal5> has anyone gotten ubuntu 6.10 working with their pvr card yet?
[02:22] <TIger_IT> D00B3Y:  in private
[02:22] <D00B3Y> LjL: sorry?
[02:22] <Kannix> TGPO: Because both, the "nv" and the closed source "nvidia" drivers for Xorg work fine.
[02:22] <LjL> D00B3Y: what?
[02:22] <D00B3Y> language?
[02:22] <TGPO> Kannix hmm
[02:22] <TIger_IT> D00B3Y:  is to know... if somethig is wrong
[02:22] <LjL> D00B3Y: see what you said above
[02:22] <D00B3Y> oh ok
[02:22] <D00B3Y> I apoligized..
[02:22] <Kannix> TGPO: And it works fine with the same hardware, using ubuntu x386
[02:22] <mcquaid> I used to use qjoypad and now I can't compile it in edgy, is there an alternative?
[02:23] <jrib> Chippy: applications > accessories > menu layout
[02:23] <nikin> do the files of the repo have anything like a checksum?
[02:23] <LjL> nikin: more than that -- they're signed using PGP keys
[02:23] <kevin> anybody know why amarok is updating to 1.4.4? i added the repos and keys...
[02:23] <Kannix> TGPO: Maybe a bug in the frambuffer driver that only shows in 64bit mode?
[02:23] <mcquaid> or I have g++ 4.1 installed, maybe it needs 3.3?  Btw, 4.1 doesn't make a sym link to /usr/bin/g++ which I found strange
[02:23] <TGPO> kannix mebbe is just a x64 glitch. I was blaming it on un ID'd hardware
[02:23] <Chippy> jrib: no such entry?
[02:23] <jrib> Chippy: what version of ubuntu?
[02:23] <Chippy> jrib: edgy
[02:24] <maxflax> why have they removed devfs_fs_kernel.h from 2.6.18.1 kernel... I need that to compile some drivers.. damn
[02:24] <jrib> Chippy: strange, can you right click on the top menu (the ubuntu icon) and select "edit menu"?
[02:25] <Chippy> jrib: ah, that works.  thanks :)
[02:25] <LjL> (which was the first thing i said 10 minutes ago anyway)
[02:25] <TGPO> is it working Icoo?
[02:26] <Kannix> ok, another question. The wifi-wiki says to install network-manager to enable and configure WPA WLAN. However, I cannot find any applet or application "network-manager" after installation. Has anyone ever gotten the network-manager to work under 6.10?
[02:26] <georgy> nikin, : and
[02:26] <Icoo> ok I logged back in and network manager showed up he is saying something about a wired connection, when I type eth1.(my wireless net) I only see disconnected
[02:26] <Skalle> good day (or night)
[02:26] <Icoo> TGP0 got the driver working...but how to connect with it
[02:26] <nikin> georgy: i ame downloading.... 19 minutes left... the repos are slow tonight
[02:27] <georgy> nikin : ok
[02:27] <Xaice> im looking for a scp client fpr gnome
[02:27] <Skalle> Is anyone available to help me with some iptables/NAT problem?
[02:27] <Icoo> TGP0 look up my message up there
[02:27] <Lathiat> Xaice: you can open "sftp://user@host/" URLs in nautilus
[02:27] <TGPO> icoo have you been into your iwconfig and set it up there?
[02:27] <jvai> icoo, nm is kida slooow... i go thru that when goin from & to wired - wireless
[02:27] <sidewalk> what has happened to xinetd in edgy ?
[02:27] <sidewalk> how do i get swat running?
[02:27] <jvai> u have to play w/ it
[02:28] <Icoo> iwconfig says it's a 802.11g connection, 54 Mb/s seems ok
[02:29] <TGPO> icoo and all of its other info is correct?
[02:29] <Skalle> I'm having problems redirecting all the udp and tcp traffic of a certain port that comes in through the router, to a certain computer on the network
[02:29] <azureal> Icoo, did you setup correct ESSID?
[02:29] <Shadow_mil> grrr!  how do I make my GTK fonts bigger!?!
[02:29] <TGPO> icoo and key
[02:29] <Icoo> I just did a iwlist eth1 scan and found my network
[02:29] <jvai> it should show up in the notification area icoo, a round blue circle for network manager, right clik it to toggle
[02:29] <Icoo> how do i connect
[02:29] <azureal> lol
[02:30] <sethk> Skalle, where are you doing the redirect?
[02:30] <Skalle> what do you mean?
[02:30] <TGPO> are you hardlined also Icoo?
[02:30] <Skalle> I am doing it on the computer in the network which I want to forward the activity to
[02:30] <sethk> Skalle, in a router, are you using your ubuntu box as a router, what are you redirecting?
[02:31] <Icoo> nope I disabled the wired network
[02:31] <Skalle> A windows box is the "king" of the router
[02:31] <sethk> Skalle, ok.  let's get a bit more specific.
[02:31] <sethk> Skalle, what traffic is to be redirected?
[02:31] <Icoo> I will try to restart the laptop, mybe this works
[02:31] <Skalle> And I want the traffic of a certain port (13871) to go to my ubuntu box
[02:31] <botxj> OMG, the new Edgy is kinda kool looking
[02:31] <botxj> it's got new nifty little features
[02:31] <reverseblade> Hello, when I resume from hibernate, my display becomes little broken with beryl. I can fix this thing by manually reloading the window manager. Is there a smarter way ?
[02:32] <karim> hey
[02:32] <botxj> i LOVE THAT!
[02:32] <sethk> Skalle, ok, but where is the traffic coming from
[02:32] <karim> dapper update to edgy is going very very bad here
[02:32] <Skalle> from the internet
[02:32] <sethk> Skalle, you can't redirect traffic at the receiver, obviously
[02:32] <karim> I can't run X
[02:32] <sethk> Skalle, well, ok, but I assume there is something between your ubuntu box and the internet  :)
[02:32] <Skalle> I used to be able to do that when I ran windows on this boc
[02:32] <karim> apt-get and aptitude are doing non-sens and insane things
[02:32] <jmdc> my /etc/network/interfaces file doesn't have eth0 set to come up automatically, but it does anyway. Any ideas why?
[02:32] <botxj> edgy is awesome!
[02:32] <Skalle> How do you mean? I am behind a router
[02:32] <karim> ubuntu have gone very bad
[02:33] <Xenguy> karim: /. will confirm your experience =)
[02:33] <sethk> Skalle, ok, so the router sends the traffic where?
[02:33] <karim> Xenguy: who ?
[02:33] <jmdc> karim: is a fresh install an option?
[02:33] <Xenguy> karim: slashdot - apparently fresh installs fare better than online 'upgrades' :-/
[02:33] <karim> jmdc: I am seriously considering it
[02:33] <LjL> reverseblade: xgl support in #ubuntu-xgl - anyway, i'd try perhaps looking at the /etc/acpi/resume.sh script or whateverit'scalled and add a command to restart the WM
[02:33] <Skalle> the router sends the traffic to the "king" of the network, I.e. the first computer connected to the router I believe
[02:33] <Icoo> nope restarted the PC but still nothing, but I can see my network when i do iwlist eth1 scan
[02:34] <Icoo> maybe i should change eth1 to wlan0 to make NM work
[02:34] <benkong2> why do I not get the option to shutdown in gnome edgy? I only get logoff, hibernate, suspend and switch user
[02:34] <sethk> Skalle, that's unlikely.  the router wouldn't be sending all traffic to the same machine.
[02:34] <Xenguy> karim: which, if true, is a damn shame
[02:34] <Skalle> I don't totally understand this, I'm sorry
[02:34] <Psi-Jack> Heya. I'm using Ubuntu-server 6.10. What does it used to set services to start/no-start at init?
[02:34] <reverseblade> LjL: I thought that. but how to restart WM by command line ?
[02:34] <Skalle> But I'll try to explain
[02:35] <sethk> Skalle, ok
[02:35] <LjL> reverseblade: dunno... how do you restart it by hand?
[02:35] <benkong2> Psi-Jack: look at update-rc.d
[02:35] <Skalle> I want some activity (tcp and udp) of a certain port to go unconditionally to this box on the network
[02:35] <Psi-Jack> Aha! update-rc.d, that's what I was looking for.
[02:35] <benkong2> or use the services on the system menu
[02:35] <Skalle> Do you have any idea what to do?
[02:36] <karim> Xenguy: I don't have much to lose on this box configuration wise
[02:36] <karim> but I must burn a cd
[02:36] <karim> for edgy
[02:36] <sethk> Skalle, yes, but you have to do it at the router
[02:36] <Psi-Jack> There. Much better. Wanted to get rid of bind, for now, from startup, while I migrate to maradns. heh
[02:36] <karim> and I will need to do it from command line
[02:36] <Xenguy> karim: if it is a fresh install, that might be easiest from what I've read
[02:36] <karim> karim: edgy the shaky shake
[02:37] <Skalle> At the router? At the box that is connected first to the router, or the router itself somehow?
[02:37] <karim> the punt doesn't work ...
[02:37] <sethk> Skalle, the router itself
[02:37] <Skalle> Thank you for your time, I'll try that
[02:37] <Xenguy> karim: a better name, yes :-)
[02:37] <Xenguy> karim: or, maybe not ;-)
[02:38] <jvai> gott, is every1 on edgy in here!!?
[02:39] <DigitalNinja> Where do I get the beta nvidia driver from?
[02:39] <byteshack> does Edgy support Beryl?
[02:39] <DigitalNinja> I'm on the nvidia website and I don't see the beta driver
[02:39] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell byteshack about beryl
[02:39] <Xenguy> jvai: I doubt it
[02:39] <maxflax> what is devfs and what is udev.. and why has udev replacd devfs?
[02:40] <jvai> lol... yep.. this is the bleeding edgy channel
[02:40] <Kannix> How can I check, if network-manager is actually running?
[02:40] <botxj> i love edgy
[02:40] <botxj> OMG
[02:40] <botxj> OMG
[02:41] <botxj> what tha
[02:41] <LjL> botxj, we're happy that you love edgy, but would you stop spamming and using caps? ;-)
[02:41] <jvai> botxj it shoulds show up in the notification area like gaim does
[02:41] <botxj> i'm sorry LjL but Xchat has a new feature now
[02:41] <jrib> if I get an intel core 2 duo can I install the 32bit version of ubuntu?
[02:41] <kevin> jrib: it goes boom!
[02:41] <jrib> kevin: D:
[02:41] <botxj> my xchat now doesnt show my name on lines that i post where nobody has posted before on IRC
[02:41] <botxj> that is why i spam OMG 2 times
[02:41] <karim> could anyone give me a link to a edgy iso for athlon K7 ? my X is broken
[02:42] <botxj> omg, i wonder what else has been changed

[02:42] <DigitalNinja> I'm on amd 64. Do I need the amd 64 nvidia driver?
[02:43] <LjL> karim: http://ftp.crihan.fr/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[02:43] <DigitalNinja> amd 64 process or on 32 bit ubuntu
[02:43] <Kannix> DigitalNinja: It depends on the distribution, not the CPU.
[02:43] <mabus> how do i unrar files of multiple parts?
[02:44] <jrib> mabus: unrar the first one and it should continue
[02:44] <cmcrae> I have the Ensoniq audioPCA (Alsa mixer) up and running. the only way I am getting sound is if the ICE958 2 is Checked. and the sound is staticy..... Any reasons why?
[02:44] <DigitalNinja> Kannix: I see. So I just use the 32 bit version then?
[02:44] <LjL> mabus, if i recally correctly, you should be able to just type "unrar filename.rar", if you have all the various parts in the same directory as the file that actually has a .rar extension
[02:45] <aoupi> mabus: unrar e file.rar
[02:45] <Kannix> DigitalNinja: If you have the 32-bit ubuntu, yes. You get the 32bit driver.
[02:45] <jvai> i cant wait for vvista to come out, to see how it compares to dapper
[02:45] <karim> halleluia !!!
[02:45] <karim> I got video
[02:45] <sethk> karim, big deal, I got a tv set.  :)
[02:46] <mabus> I tried to install -e on part01.rar, but it said "could not extract" for all of the files
[02:46] <sethk> karim, 12 inches, black and white.  :)
[02:46] <phire> I've got 2 screens set up, with out Xinerama. How do I open a program up on the other window?
[02:46] <DigitalNinja> Kannix: Thanks!
[02:46] <jrib> mabus: I just do 'unrar x part01.rar', does that fail too for you?
[02:46] <dougsko> mabus: rar e file.rar0 (or whatever the first number is)
[02:46] <LjL> sethk: cool, but i've got a 4" b/w one with only a knob for tuning, which can run out of 10 1.5V batteries
[02:46] <sethk> phire, if they are separate x displays, one is   :0.0, and the other is :0.1
[02:47] <sethk> LjL, I give, beats me.  :)
[02:47] <dougsko> heh heh...knob...
[02:47] <cmcrae> I have the Ensoniq audioPCA (Alsa mixer) up and running. the only way I am getting sound is if the ICE958 2 is Checked. and the sound is staticy..... Any reasons why?
[02:48] <phire> Sethk, I've tried firefox --display=:0.0 and 0.1 they both pop up on the main screen
[02:48] <Kannix> So, can anyone help me sort this network manager thing out? How do I start and use it? I see not application and/or applet to run. I have the packages installed and I can see a background process "nm-applet --sm-disable" under top.
[02:48] <mjbjr> so, who here is running 6.10 and checked the MD5SUM of the iso?
[02:48] <sethk> phire, not that way.  do:    export DISPLAY=:0.1
[02:48] <sethk> phire, then try running firefox
[02:49] <Psi-Jack> Hmm, Is there any deb's for dbmail 2.1 for Ubuntu?
[02:49] <sethk> phire, not all programs pay attention to the -d (it's supposed to be either -d, or --display, I believe)
[02:49] <jvai> kannix, maybe "network manager" in terminal/
[02:49] <Kannix> Where is "GNOME's notification area"?
[02:49] <Kannix> jvai: I tried that. No results.
[02:49] <phire> thanks sethk
[02:49] <sethk> Kannix, try  network-manager
[02:49] <LjL> Kannix: the system tray
[02:49] <sethk> Kannix, with the dash
[02:49] <^Ocean^> is there a quick easy way to unload all my sound drivers ?
[02:50] <cmcrae> I have the Ensoniq audioPCA (Alsa mixer) up and running. the only way I am getting sound is if the ICE958 2 is Checked. and the sound is staticy..... Any reasons why?
[02:50] <neonempyr> Ubuntu compatible digital voice recorder anyone?
[02:50] <sethk> ^Ocean^, unplug the machine.  that unloads _all_ the drivers  :)
[02:50] <geezer> hi
[02:50] <^Ocean^> lol
[02:50] <^Ocean^> yeah..
[02:50] <Kannix> sethk: There is no such application. THe only thing starting with "network" is "network-admin" which starts the regular admin tool.
[02:50] <jvai> kannix if that works in terminal u should see a blue circle
[02:50] <^Ocean^> but theres no like rmmod todo it ?
[02:50] <LjL> neonempyr: most USB mp3 readers
[02:50] <j1mc> hi all - can anyone recommend a good pcmcia wireless card?  i'm running xubuntu on a thinkpad t22.
[02:50] <^Ocean^> like remove the module and all the modules depending on it ?
[02:50] <jvai> kannix did u dl it from the repos? it's not in by default
[02:51] <sethk> Kannix, if it starts the admin tool, then it can't be true that there is no such application.  I guess I'm confused, I thought you wanted to start the network admin dialog.
[02:51] <Kannix> jvai: Yep, I downloaded and installed it.
[02:51] <neonempyr> LjL: what do you mean by mp3 readers?
[02:51] <LjL> neonempyr: mp3 players i meant. the USB-key kind.
[02:51] <Kannix> sethk: No, the network-manager tool to finally get my WLAN working on my notebook.
[02:51] <greenman> i got a message when i installed the package for nfs that i have new mail in /var/mail/michael
[02:51] <greenman> how do i read that?
[02:52] <neonempyr> LjL: There are usb-key mp3 players that record voice? I'm looking for something like a 12-hour
[02:52] <sethk> Kannix, you can use     find     to search the file system(s) for it
[02:52] <Kannix> jvai: Maybe it is because I deleted all but one toolbar and crammed everything in there?
[02:52] <georgy> greenman,  : cat /var/mail/michael
[02:52] <sethk> Kannix, or use locate, if updatedb has been run since you installed.
[02:52] <jvai> noooo! lol...
[02:52] <greenman> georgy, okay, but shouldn't i have some mail program?
[02:52] <Falstiu1> LjL, my 1G mp3 player will record over 30 hours of voice (with some conversative recording settings)
[02:53] <LjL> neonempyr: well, yeah, i think a lot of them do. mine does. about how many hours, i'd have to make a fwe calculations, but if you set the rate low enough...
[02:53] <Kannix> sethk: There is a nm-applet which according to manpage is the network-manager applet, and it is also running when I look at "ps aux"
[02:53] <georgy> greenman, : it's just a log message
[02:53] <LjL> neonempyr: well, see Falstiu1
[02:53] <jvai> oooh kannix, right clik on the panel then add to panel, see if it shows up thru there
[02:53] <Kannix> sethk: However, I cannot get any frontend to operate.
[02:53] <iter> heh
[02:53] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: I have an iRiver 790.  It is nice in most ways (1G flash)
[02:53] <Kannix> jvai: Only network monitor, not network manager.
[02:54] <neonempyr> Falstiul: good battery life on that?
[02:54] <jvai> snap
[02:54] <cmcrae> does anyone know anything about sound cards
[02:54] <sethk> Kannix, I haven't used that applet, so I'm guessing here, but sometimes the front end won't start if the back end is already running.  Have you tried killing the nm-applet and then running one of the front end tools?  see if it starts the applet in the background and communicates with it?  As I said, may or may not apply to this applet.
[02:54] <greenman> georgy: well there appears to be spam in there too
[02:54] <greenman> :)
[02:55] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: 1 AAA battery, supposedly lasts 19 hours.  It 'feels' good.  A fresh battery can record for many hours on end.  I used it recently to record some family history that my aunt was relating.
[02:55] <puff> ARgh, darnit... I'm now running into the alsa problem with rhythmbox and gtkpod, I thought I fixed that a few weeks ago.
[02:55] <aoupi> does anyone here use kasablanca (the ftp client)
[02:55] <shiv> I have grub installed I want to switch to lilo. I dual boot with windows and have only 1 HDD. How do I proceed to remove grub and install LILO
[02:55] <Kannix> sethk: Well, what is the frontend tool to the nm-applet background? I'd be glad to know :)
[02:55] <sethk> greenman, almost certainly you have the mail or mailx program, which is a console mail reading program.
[02:55] <jvai> kannix "add to panel" then "add custom app"
[02:55] <neonempyr> Falstiu1: sounds good. have any idea of the bitrate on those recordings and how they sound to you as far as quality and mic sensitivity?
[02:55] <greenman> sethk: nope.  i tried both of them
[02:55] <Kannix> jvai: Ok, which custom app is it?
[02:55] <sethk> Kannix, How can you say you have tried starting front ends for it, if you don't know what the front ends are?
[02:56] <jvai> or this might work sudo network-manager
[02:56] <sethk> greenman, then apt-get install one.  should take less than two minutes.
[02:56] <greenman> mail or mailx?
[02:56] <jvai> natwork-manager type that in
[02:56] <i_love_beer> I can't get ubuntu to load even in safe graphics
[02:56] <sethk> greenman, or, of course, you can install one of te fancy mail readers.  there are literally dozens of available mail readers
[02:56] <Kannix> sethk: I have not said I tried frontends. I said I tried to get the whole thing to run as mentioned in the wifi-wiki. But that ain't working!
[02:56] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: you can set the recording quality (sample rate, bitrate, mic gain) ... it is 'pretty good' with the built in mic and there is a line-in jack.
[02:56] <sethk> greenman, let me check
[02:56] <tritium> greenman: evolution is installed by default
[02:56] <Kannix> sethk: The wiki says, it should start automatically after relogging.
[02:56] <neonempyr> Falstiu1: thanks a lot mate, you've just ended my quest. :)
[02:56] <greenman> tritium: i'm not local to the machine
[02:57] <sethk> greenman, sudo apt-get install mailx
[02:57] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: I'm not an audiophile though.  For simple voice it is great ... it even has an auto-detect.
[02:57] <greenman> sethk: thanks
=== mikedoty is now known as Fun
[02:57] <jvai> snaaap.. kannix, do u even have a notification bar on your panel?
[02:57] <Kannix> jvai: What is a notification bar and how do I install it? :)
[02:57] <neonempyr> Falstiu1: yep, not looking for broadcast quality or anything, just for memos and lectures.
[02:57] <sethk> Kannix, wiki may be a bit out of date.  I've only done the command line stuff with wireless, maybe somebody else has more experience with the applet than I do.
[02:58] <Kannix> jvai: I am not aware of any notification bar.
[02:58] <jvai> well, when u redid your panel u may have removed it kannix
[02:58] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: oh, 1 caviat.  The firmware that comes on it doesn't act like a USB hard drive.  There is an official version of the firmware that does, but it was difficult to find.
[02:58] <shiv> I have grub installed I want to switch to lilo. I dual boot with windows and have only 1 HDD. How do I proceed to remove grub and install LILO
[02:58] <Kannix> and jvai, there is no tool such as "network-manager": no such file or directory.
[02:58] <aoupi> is there any graphical ftp client that supports SSL/TLS besides gftp and kasablanca?
[02:58] <jvai> that's why network manager may not show up
[02:58] <neonempyr> falstiu1: do you know if there is an updated model with the same features that they are selling?
[02:58] <Kannix> jvai: I might well have done that. how do I get it back?

[03:03] <LjL> !automatix | esaym
[03:03] <ubotu> esaym: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[03:04] <Cadteach> I'm having trouble with audio on an iMac.
[03:04] <prophet> does SAMBA have  a GUI
[03:04] <shuan> is there any way i can watch a shockwave movie? i have firefox 2?
[03:04] <kevin> ubotu... really? is there an alternative?
[03:04] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: you can get the UMS (the mass storage firmare) here http://www.iriveramerica.com/support/ums.aspx   .... the new T30 (the updated version of the ifp-790 I have) doesn't have a UMS version though.
[03:04] <iratsu> can anyone help me connect to my cellphone via bluetooth?
[03:04] <shuan> i tried to download shockwave plugin but it says its not available for linux
[03:04] <greenman> i always get the ln wrong.  what comes first where you are linking to, or where you are linking from?
[03:04] <ivx> jmdc so do apt-get remove --purge x
[03:04] <tritium> kevin: ubotu is a bot
[03:05] <oblib> greenman,, I believe it is "from" just like cp or mv
[03:05] <Natural_High> does anyone remember the name of that plugin for xmms hotkeys?
[03:05] <LjL> tritium: and kevin's not even that
[03:05] <georgy> greeman : from
[03:05] <greenman> thanks
[03:05] <Natural_High> I used to have it, but cannot for the life of me remember what it's claled
[03:05] <Natural_High> *called
[03:05] <Psi-Jack> Hmmm. Is there not a libsieve or libsieve-dev package for Ubuntu?
[03:05] <__mikem> Keven, ubotu is an irc bot
[03:05] <shuan> any 1 know how i can get a shockwave plugin for firefox 2?
[03:05] <jmdc> greenman: you can use man to look up a command's manual page as well
[03:05] <neonempyr> Falstiu1: is there a list of their devices that are UMS compatible? I don't see one
[03:06] <oblib> Is there a way to repair a package without uninstalling it?
[03:06] <jmdc> ivx: you're correct.
[03:06] <rummik> does anyone else get a garbled screen when they go to a console through ctrl+alt+f*?
[03:06] <Natural_High> shuan: have you tried the macromedia website?
[03:06] <esaym> oh hmm. well waht is a replacement for automatix? easyubuntu?
[03:06] <ivx> jmdc thank you sir
[03:06] <Natural_High> hmm...
[03:06] <greenman> jmdc: i did. :) it's confusing.  and i think i did it wrong.  :)  (too many levels of symbolic links)
[03:06] <Natural_High> oops
[03:06] <tritium> esaym: yes
[03:06] <ivx> jmdc or ma'am
[03:06] <jrib> shuan: installing firefox through wine is the only way I knwo of.  Adobe does not have a native shockwave plugin for linux
[03:06] <LjL> esaym: the best replacement is reading the documentation, but yes
[03:06] <Natural_High> shuan quit
[03:06] <donfilipo> sethk can not find can you tell me in wich colomn are preferences File Edit View History.... are my columns if i translate it back
[03:06] <Kannix> jvai: since you are such a nice person and patient helper :) Do you know how I can replace the ubuntu-start-button (and only that one!) in the "Human" theme with the regular gnome paw?
[03:06] <esaym> i never could get it easyubuntu installed
[03:06] <esaym> hmm
[03:07] <sethk> donfilipo, ok, one minute
[03:07] <Jeshua> (Been ages.) If anyone has the time, is it possible to edit the "Session" Menu on the Login Screen? Thanks in advance.
[03:07] <jmdc> ivx hahaha
[03:07] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: that link lists UMS versions of the firmware that are available.  Even without the UMS firmware, there is an opensource utility that lets you use the dev with linux.  It is a little annoying though.
[03:07] <LocoMan> can anyone help me to get the altgr key working?
[03:07] <Kannix> jvai: I do not want to change the whole theme, just that one icon.
[03:07] <greenman> ah ha
[03:07] <greenman> got it
[03:07] <greenman> thanks guys
[03:07] <Scrape> I'm using Xubuntu; how do I get the linux-wlan-ng drivers to load automatically instead of the hostap_cs driver? (Normally orinoco_cs gets loaded; I blacklisted that in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist, but now it loads hostap!)
[03:07] <neonempyr> Falstiu1: looks like iRiver now suppors T series UMS: http://www.mtp-ums.net/
[03:07] <georgy> greenman,  ; no pb
[03:07] <jvai> wait... i emailed the link bfore i installed dapper from hoary, lemme look it up
[03:07] <Psi-Jack> HEYA: is there an ubuntu equivalent package to debian's libsieve2-dev?
[03:07] <sethk> donfilipo, on the menu, you do:     edit/preferences
[03:08] <sethk> donfilipo, that opens a dialog with 5 or 6 sections at the top:  general, privacy, content, *, downloads, advance
[03:08] <sethk> donfilipo, the * and the "5 or 6" is because it depends on what extensions you have installed (if any)
[03:08] <georgy> nikin,: some news ?
[03:08] <donfilipo> sethk yes i have in my lingo it's Urejanje Nastavitve
[03:09] <sethk> donfilipo, in any event, go to the "downloads" section.  It should be the last button, just above help.
[03:09] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: cool.  I wish I had an excuse to buy a new one :)  They're about half as much now.
[03:09] <sethk> donfilipo, can't help with the language, if it isn't english or spanish I'm pretty useless :)
[03:09] <neonempyr> falstiu1: yep. thanks again mate, night
[03:10] <Falstiu1> neonempyr: np.
[03:10] <donfilipo> sethk i have it it's vrste datotek in my lingo...i was there before but....something is wrong

[03:10] <jvai> 
[03:10] <jvai> ooops
[03:10] <elyezer> someone programming c++ on anjuta ide???
[03:11] <jvai> kannix bookmark that
[03:11] <Cadteach> Anyone with experience installing on a mac?
[03:11] <Kannix> jvai: Thanks. I'll look at it now :)
[03:11] <ivx> does anyone know if pureftpd is as secure as they say?
[03:11] <Scrape> Or, why do I get repeated TX timeouts with my prism2 card using orinoco_cs? It seems to occur especially when I try to print via CUPS, such that I can't actually print. I'm 99% sure it's the network card... I can use the internet, but as soon as I try to print to my print server, I see tons of timeouts and NETDEV resets.
[03:11] <iter> ivx: proftpd is good
[03:12] <donfilipo> sethk there i have 4 sorts of endings which i can edit but can not ad a new one....is that only in my lingo version??? probalby a bug or is there a trick????
[03:12] <elyezer> someone help me with anjuta IDE?
[03:12] <ivx> iter and i have multiple accounts, each one link to a different directory
[03:12] <Zambezi> I just installed a harddrive, but when I tried to format it I got an errormessage. How can I check for sure it's proper connected more than dmesg?
[03:12] <sethk> donfilipo, let me look
[03:12] <ivx> iter *can i
[03:12] <Jeshua> Hm.
[03:12] <iter> ivx: yes of course
[03:13] <elyezer> i need to compile c++ on it but i didn't. because library iostream is show problems
[03:13] <Psi-Jack> Is there an ubuntu equivalent package to debian's libsieve2-dev?
[03:13] <sethk> donfilipo, I'll see if I can discover how to add one.
[03:13] <Psi-Jack> I'm trying to get dbmail 2.1.7 to work on my ubunti-server, with sieve support.
[03:13] <mortal5> j1mc, get one with the atheros chipset
[03:13] <sethk> elyezer, I downloaded and installed the gcc source tarball, and anjuta is happy.  but most people think that's a terrible idea.
[03:14] <ivx> iter well i tried vsftpd and can't figure out how to make it to that... would you say proftp is better than pureftpd
[03:14] <donfilipo> sethk *.SPL, *.FLI, *.QTL, *.SQL are my endings wich are there but avi, wmv work fine not being there?
[03:14] <Jeshua> Anybody? I'm just curious about editing my session menu on my login screen.
[03:14] <jvai> kannix in the ubuntu forums there was another menu theme w/ a niice gmone foot, but u gotta look for it in the posted desktop section, then read it
[03:14] <sethk> donfilipo, there is also a mapping that is part of gnome (or kde, whichever you are running) and not specific to firefox.
[03:14] <sethk> donfilipo, you get to it from the kde control center.  gnome should have something similar.
[03:15] <greenman> I'm trying to mount an exported fs, i get this:  NFS Portmap: RPC: Program not registered
[03:15] <greenman> what does that mean?
[03:15] <donfilipo> sethk aha i will look
[03:16] <mikeconcepts> what is falcon?
[03:16] <mikeconcepts> !falcon
[03:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about falcon - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:16] <elyezer> sethk, but when i include a library like iostrem show many errors
[03:17] <Natural_High> hey, can someone help me with an xmms plugin problem?
[03:17] <elyezer> sethk, i need to download the libraries for c++?
[03:17] <georgy> greenman,  : http://www-oss.fnal.gov/projects/fermilinux/common/faq/old/0021.html
[03:17] <Scrape> How do I prevent one network card driver from being loaded in place of another? Blacklisting hostap doesn't seem to work.
[03:18] <sethk> elyezer, I think you need the header files.  you already have the libs, probably
[03:18] <ivx> how do you stop a program from the terminal
[03:18] <LjL> ivx: ctrl+c
[03:18] <sethk> elyezer, look for packages with gcc and dev in the name
[03:18] <sethk> ivx, killall  programname
[03:18] <jvai> back.. the wifi went out in here
[03:19] <jvai> it's too many ppl in this place i'm @
[03:19] <elyezer> sethk, i don't understand
[03:19] <iter> ivx: haven't used pureftpd but either should work
[03:19] <slinky_> i have a problem opening a program from a right click menu
[03:19] <greenman> georgy: so if I'm reading that right, then i have to change hosts.allow on the exporting machine?
[03:19] <elyezer> sethk, i've downloaded g++ yet
[03:19] <sethk> elyezer, I know
[03:19] <iter> ivx: pureftpd claims to work w/no config, so I don't know if that matters to you
[03:19] <sethk> elyezer, there are separate packages, sometimes, for the libraries.  plus...
[03:20] <georgy> greenman, : added the host(s)
[03:20] <sethk> elyezer, executing programs only need the .so files, but to build you also need the headers (iostream, used to be called iostream.h, etc.)
[03:20] <elyezer> sethk, need dev package too?
[03:20] <sethk> elyezer, right, to get the headers
[03:20] <sethk> elyezer, also probably to get debug versions of certain libraries, that sort of thing
[03:20] <elyezer> sethk, sudo apt-get dev???
[03:20] <greenman> georgy: ?  added the host(s) ?
[03:21] <sethk> elyezer, no, you need the entire package name  :)  I'll get you an example
[03:21] <Cadteach> Anyone with experience installing on a mac?
[03:21] <elyezer> sethk, ok
=== SportChick is now known as superchick
[03:21] <slinky_> i grep-ed the system and can't find my problem, anyone like to help
[03:22] <georgy> greenman, : I mean add the hostmachine in /etc/hosts
=== superchick is now known as SportChick
[03:22] <greenman> georgy: ah, i shoulda done that anyway.
[03:22] <sethk> elyezer, an example:  package libstdc++6-dev
[03:22] <MrWoo> i just upgraded to edgy, and my all of a sudden my X-server died, I have no gui
[03:22] <sethk> elyezer, run synaptic, click on search, type in libstdc
[03:22] <georgy> greenman : sorry, /etc/host.allow
[03:22] <sethk> elyezer, that will show you all packages with libstdc in the name.
[03:23] <greenman> georgy: *not* /etc/hosts?
[03:23] <elyezer> sethk,  libstdc++-dev
[03:23] <elyezer> ?
[03:23] <georgy> greenman,  : no in /etc/hosts.allow
[03:23] <sethk> elyezer, I have libstdc++6-dev, not libstdc++-dev
[03:24] <slinky_> i don't know where to look to try and solve my problem
[03:24] <w01> anyone know how i can put java in a package to install/everything i've tried doesn't seem to work
[03:24] <sethk> elyezer, use the search.  In fact, use synaptic, it makes life easier.
[03:24] <greenman> so, like this:  ALL: 192.168.1.*/255.255.255.0 ?
[03:24] <elyezer> sethk, i'll try this
[03:24] <whyameye> so dapper and edgy are now sharing this channel? I'm not finding much online resources for edgy and my install suggested lots more bugs than w/ dapper. Are people having success with edgy?
[03:24] <elyezer> sethk, i'm searching... my pc is too bad
[03:25] <bruenig> whyameye, I am having great success with edgy (xubuntu)
[03:25] <sethk> whyameye, edgy has been out for, what, hours?  a few days?  of course it has glitches.
[03:25] <sethk> whyameye, now that edgy is out, I'm going to move to dapper
[03:25] <sandy16> hi there
[03:25] <georgy> greenman, : i guess
[03:25] <sethk> whyameye, which is what you should do unless you _need_ something in edgy.
[03:25] <whyameye> sethk: it's a release. When dapper was released it was already better than breezy
[03:25] <greenman> k
[03:25] <bruenig> sethk, unless you use your desktop for tinkering and messing around with stuff of course
[03:26] <sethk> whyameye, not true, there were many glitches in it.
[03:26] <whyameye> bruenig: you have cups working for you?
[03:26] <bruenig> whyameye, yep
[03:26] <elyezer> sethk, so that is a easy mode to i install anjuta 2.0.2?
[03:26] <sethk> bruenig, sure, but then you expect a few glitches.
[03:26] <sethk> elyezer, sure, you can install it from synaptic.  just search for anjuta, click on it, right click, say install
[03:26] <whyameye> sethk: ok. My experience with dapper was different than yours then.
[03:26] <slinky_> Admiral Chicago: can you try to help me with a problem?
[03:26] <sethk> whyameye, I didn't personally have problems with dapper, I helped many many  people who did.
[03:26] <elyezer> sethk, but i'm using breezy badger
[03:26] <ZehRique> hello, could anyone help me installing grub on my new computer?
[03:27] <sethk> elyezer, that's fine, so am I
[03:27] <ZehRique> PVT me
[03:27] <greenman> georgy: that didn't work
[03:27] <shadowhywind> does anyone know hot to get superkaramba to read net stats?
[03:27] <donfilipo> sethk i can not find it....it is not as somple in gnome as in kde looks like but there is also another thing....if i open *.ram file (real media) normaly from let us say clippboard link it opens ok only if i click a link in firefox browser it opens in a remain of something which did never work....so probably i need to know in wich file exaclty this settings are and edit them manualy old fassion way typing....so is there any expert in firefox?
[03:27] <bobbyyu> My Kubuntu crashed on itself and now I lost the Java path
[03:27] <slinky_> sethk: can you try to help me with a problem?
[03:27] <elyezer> sethk, i'm brazilian you're understanding me good?
[03:27] <bruenig> sethk, your theory of upgrading is very problematic, if everyone follows your theory of wait for a long time and then upgrade, the glitches are never found because nobody uses them and then nobody ever upgrades
[03:27] <bobbyyu> Can someone plesae tell me how to export a java path in Linux?
[03:28] <sandy16> can any body tell me how to restore the loading screen from kubuntu to normal ubuntu?
[03:28] <sethk> bruenig, no, the glitches just aren't found by _me_.  actually, I have two machines I upgrade.  my production boxes I wait.
[03:28] <bruenig> right but if your upgrading strategies are used by everyone, they aren't found by anyone
[03:28] <sethk> bruenig, true, but never fear, there are always tons of people who want it RIGHT NOW  :)
[03:29] <bruenig> right

[03:30] <shadowhywind> slinky_ whats your problem? maybe i can help
[03:30] <slinky_> in the spirit of ubuntu, of course

[03:31] <sethk> slinky_, there is so much traffic, I've forgotten what your problem is.
[03:31] <sethk> elyezer, ok, dependencies are good, that's how the package manager helps save you tons of work
[03:31] <Psi-Jack> Heh, well, bleh. I just imported a debian deb-source, so I can build libsieve2. :p

[03:42] <slinky_> shadowhywind: thanks for your help, i'm going to reformat and reinstall everything, been 5 days trying to solve this, only takes an hour to reinstall, thanks again

[03:42] <shadowhywind> i hate to see you do that
[03:43] <tehbrandon> ^ Good information for mythtv listings
[03:43] <anderbubble> is there any way to set the volume label of a fat/vfat partition without mtools?
[03:43] <shadowhywind> what did amarok say?
[03:43] <D00B3Y`> please help!!! http://pastebin.ca/231875 ... I added the repositories and everything!!!
[03:43] <anderbubble> and if not, how do I do it with mtools?
[03:43] <frederick85> Flannel: Mysql Console is a console program, i'm looking for something like  GTK prog or something
[03:43] <Flannel> frederick85: MySQL has a GUI frontend... "MySQL Query Browser" is the real name, I suppose
[03:43] <kitche> samuel: those are just your chipset you have a nvidia chipset in your computer?
[03:43] <slinky_> shadowhywind, so do i but ... unknown error, unknown resolution
[03:43] <samuel> kitche, apparently
[03:43] <shadowhywind> thats werid, have you got any sound working?
[03:43] <D00B3Y`> does anyone know?
[03:44] <Gevaudan82> Flannel: there's the gui mysqladmin and a console mysqladmin...the former is basically to edit users, set permissions, and import/export dumps...the console can basically do everything that the gui can do
[03:44] <kitche> samuel: you have to install the video driver still if that's what you want to install
[03:44] <Flannel> frederick85: and, then 'MySQL Administrator', is for administration
[03:44] <samuel> kitche, i also have an nvidia graphics card, could it be X is crashing because it doesnt know what one?
[03:44] <D00B3Y`> please someone help me?
[03:45] <slinky_> shadowhywind: sound plays if i select Open with Rhythmbox but fails if i double click on mp3 file, says "its n mp3 document" Warning...
[03:45] <kitche> samuel: no see what driver your X is using it's most likely using vesa if you didn't install the binary driver or enable the nv driver
[03:45] <frederick85> Flannel: most servers don't bother running X so you need to be specific about MYSQL I think

[03:46] <shadowhywind> slinky_ so your sound works perfecly fine, just not on opening?
[03:46] <iratsu> why is hidd --search unable to find my bluetooth device?
[03:46] <Flannel> frederick85: it doesn't need to be on that server, you can use MySQL Adminstrator/Query Browser from a remote machine, they're separate programs
[03:46] <donfilipo> anyone knows in wich file mozilla&firefox have written with what helper application they should open *.ram streams (real media)????
[03:46] <slinky_> shadowhywind, well it did before i uninstalled everything
[03:46] <samuel> kitche, its using vesa, ive tried to get nvidia working but no luck so far... i just read i need the specific kernel for my cpu... so ill install that first then see what i see
[03:46] <D00B3Y`> Flannel, thanks
[03:46] <shadowhywind> slinky_ what do you mean everything?
[03:47] <frederick85> Flannel: what is the name of the Query Browser?
[03:47] <frederick85> Flannel: in my case I want it on the same machine, my purpose is just for testing
[03:47] <Flannel> frederick85: "MySQL Query Browser" : http://mysql.com/products/tools/
[03:47] <Flannel> frederick85: right, but they're entirely independant of each other
[03:48] <frederick85> Flannel: thanks
[03:48] <slinky_> shadowhywind: music player, totem , all codecs and mp3 stuff, reinstalled only ubuntu desktop, totem, music player and gstreamer, but still end up wuth two entries in popup menu when right clicking to play file
[03:48] <frederick85> Flannel: so I type sudo apt-get install "Mysql query browser"
[03:49] <Flannel> frederick85: no, I have no idea what the package name is.  Or even if it is one.  Let me look.
[03:49] <sanmarcos> frederick85: apt-cache search mysql query browser, see the package name
[03:49] <shadowhywind> sliny_ i asumed you tried to rightclick on the file, select your program and say always open with that program
[03:49] <frederick85> flannel: i asked my good friend google
[03:50] <Flannel> frederick85: "mysql-admin" : http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/admin/mysql-admin
[03:50] <slinky_> shadowhywind: with everything uninstalled comletely including configuration files i still get one entry to Open with Rhythmbox music player
[03:50] <frederick85> sanmarcos: that search method isn't as reliable as google I find
[03:50] <Flannel> frederick85: and "mysql-query-browser"
[03:50] <shadowhywind> oh, that is a little over my head
[03:50] <sanmarcos> frederick85: you have to know how to use it, --names-only. and grepping out, using quotes
[03:50] <sanmarcos> frederick85: just as google, brother.
[03:50] <slinky_> sharowhywind: that works fine if i reinstall everything but i get two entries in menu and an error if i double click on mp3 file
[03:51] <Flannel> frederick85: or, since you're using a GUI, search in synaptic.

[03:52] <oblib> I just updated to Edgy -- does anyone know why emacs can no longer find a good font?
[03:52] <Scrape> Anyone help me solve some issues with a wireless net card under xubuntu?
[03:52] <sanmarcos> oblib: because emacs doenst use xft/fontconfig
[03:53] <sanmarcos> !doesnt work > Scrape
[03:53] <kitche> Scrape: chipset of your wireless card?
[03:53] <ppmstr> hell with ati drivers.
[03:54] <Scrape> kitche: Prism2, I believe. It's a D-Link SWL-650. It works w/ the orinoco_cs driver... EXCEPT... it generates a lot of TX timeouts, especially when I try to print to remote print server... enough that I can't actually print.
[03:54] <slinky_> shadowhywind: I'll move my data files over to a windows drive and i'll reinstall ubuntu, something is wrong in a configuration file and i just dont know where to look yet, thank you very much for your help
[03:54] <JuJuBee> I thought that I would get Firefox 2.0 if I upgraded to edgy?
[03:54] <JuJuBee> I still have 1.5.0.7
[03:54] <ppmstr> I'm currently trying to use fglrx with no success for an ati radeon X1600... anyone can provide a hand? xorg error logs reports several io allocations errors... (if you want I can post the log on some pastebin)
[03:55] <mirak> aptitude wants to remove fspot and such, I don't understand why
[03:55] <jstarcher> Anyone good with GRUB? I have a windows partition that I want to reformat to a linux FS but I think it will mess up my boot config
[03:55] <mirak> now aptitude wants to remove mysql, that's insane
[03:55] <shadowhywind> hope your problem is fixed after the reinstall, sometimes that is the best, before we start pulling hair out
[03:56] <Psi-Jack> Okay, for PostgreSQL 8.1, what's the main admin user set to, in Ubuntu?
[03:56] <shadowhywind> anyone use karamba
[03:56] <slinky_> shadowhywind: i so much agree, thanks again
[03:56] <ppmstr> anyone can help with that sort of classic ati driver config problem
[03:57] <kitche> jstarcher: it won't mess up the config really
[03:57] <ppmstr> For myself I'm getting quite sick of it.
[03:57] <Scrape> W/ no files in /etc/pcmcia by default, how does Ubuntu figure out what driver to load for a given PCMCIA card?
[03:57] <kitche> Scape: ok have you tried a different channel by chance for your card and router? to make sure there isn't something interfereing with them
[03:57] <teledyn> Scrape: could there be radio interference from a nearby AP on the same channel?
[03:58] <kholer>  I tried camorama but get error "Could not connect to video device (/dev/video1). Please check connection." I'm using the edgy livecd on a laptop with a webcam. ANy siggestions?
[03:58] <jstarcher> kitche: I have windows on the primary boot partition and linux on a logical partition. I won't have a boot partition if I format the windows partition. It will still work?
[03:58] <Scrape> kitche: I have two laptops... one does just fine, the other doesn't. Identical setups, except for the cards.
[03:58] <Scrape> Identical configs, I should say, not identical laptops.
[03:59] <kitche> jstarcher: well /boot in linux should be a primary partition so it might mess up if your boot isn't on a primary partition
[03:59] <variant> wtf is it with azureus? its been broken for months and noone will fi it
[03:59] <glombool> !nvidia-glx
[03:59] <variant> fix*
[03:59] <ubotu> nvidia-glx: NVIDIA binary XFree86 4.x/X.Org driver. In component restricted, is optional. Version 1.0.8774+2.6.17.5-11 (edgy), package size 3970 kB, installed size 12312 kB
[03:59] <Scrape> I'm trying alternate drivers for the card. Hostap_cs is worse than orinoco_cs. O
[03:59] <teledyn> Scrape: maybe one card is higher powered than the other?
[03:59] <Scrape> I'd like to try wlan-ng, but can't figure out how to make it work. I've blacklisted orinoco and hostap so they don't load, but still no luck.
[03:59] <Scrape> teledyn: I'm 10 feet from the router.
[04:00] <jstarcher> kitche: I think I made grub on my MBR though. I can't seem to find a config file. There are some files in /boot but not grub.conf
[04:00] <Scrape> teledyn: And, it worked fine under Win98.
[04:00] <kitche> jstarcher: /boot/grub/menu.lst is what you want
[04:00] <shadowhywind> variant what is wrong with azureus
[04:00] <teledyn> Scrape: maybe an issue with the driver.  i don't know.
[04:00] <variant> shadowhywind: nm, i see that the bug was fixed recently :P#
[04:01] <Scrape> teledyn: that's what I'm figuring. Trying to use alternate drivers, but can't get wlan-ng to work.
[04:01] <ppmstr> ah fuck off this ati shit... forums are cracking with unanswered post with people trying to get their card working,,, Feels like I have better things to do than figure out why there are bad i/o allocation for my divers...
[04:01] <jvai> mythtv is too heavy for me, i installed then uninstalled, i ran into dependency probs on the install
[04:01] <jstarcher> kitche: ahhhh thanks!
[04:01] <nikin> what program should i use for remote accesing X?
[04:01] <me> hello
[04:01] <me> everybody
[04:01] <variant> ppmstr: mind your language, and thats what youget iwth proprietry drivers :P
[04:01] <teledyn> Scrape: you could always build wlan-ng from source and load it manualy
[04:01] <kitche> jstarcher: but the formating the windows shouldn't effect grub since it has nothing to do with windows since it sits on the linux partiton
[04:01] <oblib> sanmarcos, can I fix it?
[04:01] <teledyn> Scrape: just modprobe -r  the other modules
[04:01] <sanmarcos> oblib: get emacs cvs
[04:02] <jstarcher> kitche: so when I delete the primary dos partition do I leave the boot tag on it?
[04:02] <ppmstr> variant: As far as I know nvidia are not quite open drivers though, they work.
[04:02] <blaze> Hello all
[04:02] <me> today I have installed ubuntu, when I installed ubuntu with DVDI got sopport for my reader of cards, but now I installed with CD and I did not get it, what do I have to do?
[04:02] <Scrape> teledyn: The module is loaded, but it doesn't seem to see the device.
[04:02] <jstarcher> kitche: remember that's the one that has windows. I will be splitting it into a couple smaller partitions as well
[04:02] <ppmstr> anyways,... spent to much time on that.
[04:02] <variant> ppmstr: they are certainly not open, and they have thier own share of problems
[04:02] <Scrape> Do PCMCIA modules have to be associated with the device ID somehow, or should it, if it's loaded, automagically find it's device.
[04:02] <variant> pprandom lockups to name one
[04:02] <teledyn> Scrape: did you install linux-wlan-ng
[04:03] <Scrape> teledyn: yes. Doesn't seem to do anything.
[04:03] <blaze> I am just getting ubuntu running for the first time, and I was wondering if any one could point me in the right direction to find ubuntu resources
[04:03] <kitche> teledyn: I checked wlan-ng supported devices and it seems like Scrape's card isn't supported
[04:03] <teledyn> Scrape: the module loads.  can you ifconfig the device up?
[04:03] <ryjax> anyone ever get a 'received broken pipe signal' error when configuring cvs for sending emails?
[04:03] <me> today I have installed ubuntu, when I installed ubuntu with DVDI got sopport for my reader of cards, but now I installed with CD and I did not get it, what do I have to do?
[04:03] <oblib> sanmarcos, do you know if emacs will be fixed in Ubuntu eventuallly, or will I always have to compile on my own?
[04:04] <kitche> jstarcher: well grub doesn't care really what partition is tagged as bootable really
[04:04] <Scrape> teledyn: nope
[04:04] <kholer> can someone help me with getitng my webcam working? I tried camorama but it gets an error
[04:04] <me> today I have installed ubuntu, when I installed ubuntu with DVDI got sopport for my reader of cards, but now I installed with CD and I did not get it, what do I have to do?
[04:04] <sanmarcos> oblib: its not about fixing, nothing is broken. A feature is not supported
[04:04] <sanmarcos> oblib: and distros do not include CVS versions in most cases, try #emacs
[04:04] <cam_> does anyone know if there will be a 686 kernel for edgy. becasue the 386 is really slow!
[04:05] <teledyn> Scrape: i don't know if maybe there's some parameter on the card you can tweak with the prism driver using the iwpriv command
[04:05] <me> today I have installed ubuntu, when I installed ubuntu with DVDI got sopport for my reader of cards, but now I installed with CD and I did not get it, what do I have to do?
[04:05] <oblib> sanmarcos, so do I need to enable something specifically before I 'make' the CVS version? and why did it work before but doesn't now?
[04:05] <kholer> me: I'm no quite sure what you mean..
[04:06] <kholer> me: you have a card reader and its not working?
[04:06] <sanmarcos> oblib: I dont use emacs.
[04:06] <me> kholer: my card reader does not work
[04:07] <me> today I have installed ubuntu, when I installed ubuntu with DVDI got sopport for my reader of cards, but now I installed with CD and I did not get it, what do I have to do?
[04:07] <kelten> How do I see what permissions each file has in a folder?
[04:07] <cam_> yes we can see the message me: but you need to explain it a bit better
[04:07] <MTecknology> What was the command to monitor the data a device is processing? I tried cat /dev/ttyS1 to 7 but got an error "cat: /dev/ttyS1: Input/output error"
[04:07] <oblib> sanmarcos, 'CVS version' of a program usually just means the most recent, possible exerimental, version, right?
[04:07] <teledyn> kelten: ls -l
[04:08] <zanophol> I have installed edgy with gnome and kde. When I login, I have huge fonts for login and password...is there something I need to change in my xorg.conf, since this seems independent of gnome or kde?
[04:08] <me> cam_: my cards reader does not work
[04:08] <kitche> MTecknology: is it a terminal device?
[04:08] <kelten> Whats the command to find out what distro im running and what version
[04:08] <sanmarcos> oblib: cvs head, yes, I suggest you #emacs, again
[04:08] <MTecknology> kitche, it's a stylus
[04:08] <me> I insert a sd and it does not work
[04:08] <MTecknology> that i'm trying to monitor
[04:08] <ryjax> if i'm in the wrong channel for cvs help, can someone tell me where to go pls?
[04:08] <wladston> I'm facing a bug on firefox. I'm on edgy. It will only show up pages when I redimension my window
[04:08] <kitche> kelten: uname -a will show you all the information you want
[04:09] <kelten> It jsut says Linux though
[04:09] <teledyn> kelten: lsb_release -a
[04:09] <kelten> okay, thanks
[04:09] <sethk> kelten, that tells you info about the kernel, really, nothing else
[04:09] <cam_> mme: any output from dmesg after inputing a card?
[04:09] <reverseblade> how can i switch to metacity as default with beryl ?
[04:09] <oblib> sanmarcos, but this seems to be a problem with the Ubuntu package -- it worked in Dapper, but doesn't in Edgy. It seems like a distro shouldn't distribute a bad package...
[04:09] <sethk> kelten, I was talking about uname, not about lsb_....
[04:10] <sanmarcos> oblib: its free, dont complain
[04:10] <wladston> noone can help me to fix firefox ??
[04:10] <sethk> oblib, then we wouldn't have anybody to help here
[04:10] <MTecknology> kitche, do you know?
[04:10] <kelten> ya, i know
[04:10] <wladston> wow
[04:10] <sanmarcos> oblib: fix it yourself, thats the motto
[04:10] <kitche> MTecknology: nope
[04:10] <wladston> not it asked me to report a bug
[04:10] <MTecknology> damn
[04:10] <wladston> ok
[04:11] <oblib> sanmarcos, not everyone can do that (but I suppose people who can't woudln't be using emacs) so it makes sense to try to fix the package. Is this worth filing a bug on?
[04:11] <oblib> sethk, what do you mean?
[04:11] <sanmarcos> oblib: yes it is worth, and people who can do use emacs a lot
[04:11] <babo> guys, does the ubuntu ff installation come with the DOM inspector on it ?
[04:12] <cam_> riversblade: i think you are confused, metacity and beryl are do the same thing. You can only be using one or the other
[04:12] <jrib> babo: install firefox-dom-inspector package
[04:12] <oblib> sanmarcos, I guess my question really is "Is emacs broken in Edgy, or is it likely something specific only to my set up"?
[04:12] <mjbjr> it seems to me that if you're "unixy" enough to use emacs, you're "unixy" enough to be using a "real" linux distro   ;)
[04:12] <sethk> oblib, I wasn't being serious.
[04:12] <oblib> sanmarcos, do you know if it is universally broken in edgy?
[04:13] <babo> thanks
[04:13] <sanmarcos> oblib: dont use emacs, and its called edgy for a reason
[04:13] <sethk> oblib, seems unlikely, since it hasn't changed in ages, but I can't be certain.
[04:13] <ianmacgregor> emacs is a nice OS.
[04:14] <kitche> ianmacgregor: yeah the text editor is nice also :)
[04:14] <teledyn> oblib: check to see if there are any outstanding bugs matching yours
[04:14] <oblib> Is anyone else having problems here with emacs in Edgy?
[04:15] <oblib> teledyn, is there an easy way to do that, or do I just need to search Launchpad?
[04:15] <teledyn> oblib: i don't know, but imagine there's some ubuntu page where you can search for bugs by package
[04:15] <Farnaby> oblib, I haven't had any problems with emacs yet but I don't use it much
[04:16] <oblib> Farnaby, can you pull it up in Gnome and see letters? All I'm getting is boxes (bad font)
[04:17] <Farnaby> oblib, I was able to a while ago, yeah
[04:17] <oblib> Farnaby, in Edgy?
[04:18] <Farnaby> I beieve I pulled it up sunday morning which is after I converted yeah
[04:18] <Farnaby> believe even
[04:18] <hocmin> I'm having problems getting mp3 support with a fresh install of ubuntu.  Most sites I find searching suggesting installing various gstreamer packages, but that doesn't seem to be helping
=== Echtor`off is now known as Echtor2oo3
[04:19] <whyameye> hocmin did you try:
[04:19] <whyameye> !restricted formats
[04:19] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:19] <Farnaby> hocmin, one of the two problems I have found since I upgraded to edgy is that quark no longer seems to be willing to play MP3 files
[04:19] <hocmin> whyameye: no, but I'll take a look at those.  Thanks
[04:19] <oblib> Okay, looks like someone's reported a bug already : https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xfontsel/+bug/57803
[04:21] <Farnaby> The other issue I am having is that my screensaver is fubared
[04:21] <Fracture> hi.  I keep getting "Message from syslogd@localhost" etc.. messages in every console on my machine.  How can I stop this ?
[04:21] <hocmin> whyameye, taking a quick look at those pages it appears that it's suggesting I convert all my mp3's to ogg?
[04:21] <Farnaby> And FF is now seeming to crash a lot, odd
[04:21] <dibblego> when upgrading I got into trouble with apt-get and samba - http://rafb.net/paste/results/sjqsTh39.html - how do I resolve it?
[04:23] <swiz> I just upgraded to 6.10, and my network seems to be borked.  I can return pings from sites, but I can't make any sort of connection (http, ssh, ftp) to any location.  Any ideas?
[04:24] <whyameye> hocmin: I think it's there, interspersed with the ogg stuff.
[04:26] <kmasta> ok what the crap, i just upgraded to edgy and now X server has crashed, it says it cant find my video drivers
[04:26] <Farnaby> I just realised that it won't let me download libggi2 for edgy...
[04:27] <kitche> kmasta: try installing your driver for your video card should be sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-<driver>
[04:27] <Farnaby> wonder if thats whats causing my screensaver bork
[04:28] <neonempyr> Quicksilver-like app launcher for Ubuntu?
[04:28] <swiz> just upgraded to edgy, but I have a network issue.  All of my pings are returned, but I cannot make a tcp or udp connection of any type (ssh, http, etc).  any ideas?
[04:28] <kmasta> kitche, it was working just fine with dapper though
[04:29] <kitche> kmasta: try reinstalling the video driver though it might fix your problem
[04:29] <neonempyr> swiz are you wireless?
[04:29] <Farnaby> Does anybody else use quark?
[04:30] <kmasta> kitche, am I supposed to put like ATI where you wrote driver
[04:30] <neonempyr> swiz: are you wireless?
[04:30] <kitche> kmasta: yes if you have an ati card
[04:30] <kmasta> kitche, well in that case it says I already have the latest version
[04:30] <kitche> kmasta: if your using the binary driver you have to reinstall it since edgy uses a different kernel then dapper
[04:30] <swiz> neonempyr: no, wired lan.  worked fine in 6.06 and in a dualboot on another os, so its not the network itself.
[04:30] <jvai> neonempyr, swiz left
[04:31] <kmasta> kitche: i have no idea what that is, Iwas just using the ATI driver that  came with dapper
[04:31] <jvai> oop there he is
[04:31] <swiz> i did?
[04:31] <AlanHaggai> I had used the synaptic manager to download kubuntu-desktop and all the dependencies. I downloaded all of it and didn't install. How to install it now?
[04:31] <neonempyr> swiz: Are you pinging domains or your router?
[04:31] <kmasta> kitche: i noticed the driver in xorg.conf was set to vesa, i set it to ATI and thats still didn'twork
[04:31] <kitche> kmasta: check /var/log/Xorg.0.log and pastebin it if you can
[04:31] <Farnaby> GDI. Gnome screensaver is still borked. Won't let me select another screensaver other then BioF. When I try I have to forcequit
[04:31] <jvai> aftr the question about quartz, it said u left swiz
[04:31] <swiz> neonempyr: i checked the router and other machines on the local netork, and machines on the internet itself
[04:32] <neonempyr> swiz: are your domains resolving to an IP address when you ping?
[04:32] <swiz> neonempyr: yes
[04:32] <kmasta> kitche, hold on onesecond don'tmove
[04:32] <kitche> jvai he did part then he returned right after probably swiz just hit a wrong key
[04:32] <jvai> oo ok
[04:33] <neonempyr> swiz: so your other apps don't have internet access then, right? nothing else?
[04:33] <Rav|strangler> is there an .chm viewer on linux?

[04:34] <AlanHaggai> ok friends, found it :)
[04:34] <kmasta> kitche; ok i got it
[04:34] <obo12> Anyone here proficient with vim?
[04:34] <swiz> neonempyr: i upgraded earlier today, and things were working fine.  i was doing some tasks, and great.  then this problem struck.  but i had just done a clean install, so i figured i must hve messed something up, so ill save time and just reinstall pure.
[04:34] <whyameye> Rav|strangler, try gnochm. I think it's in the ubuntu repos.
[04:34] <Rav|strangler> oh ok thanks
[04:34] <kmasta> kitche: what am I looking for
[04:34] <swiz> neonempyr: but ive had the same problem on 3 vanilla installs since.
[04:34] <AlanHaggai> Ho obo12
[04:35] <AlanHaggai> Hi
[04:35] <kitche> kmasta: look for any errors mostly lines that start with EE is probably where you find what is wrong
[04:35] <neonempyr> swiz: I had a similar problem with my ethernet when I installed dapper, let alone edgy. my router appeared to be fine just like you
[04:35] <obo12> AlanHaggai: Hello
[04:35] <Perissatto> i have worked with vim at long time.
[04:35] <kmasta> (EE) no drivers available
[04:35] <neonempyr> swiz: did you happen to have your ethernet unplugged when you installed?
[04:35] <MrProper_> Hey all, im having a problem with edgy and rdesktop, screen refreshes are borked. if i drag another window over an rdesktop/tsclient window, it will not refresh that section
[04:35] <swiz> neonempyr: no, plugged in
[04:35] <AlanHaggai> obo12 : what is the problem?
[04:35] <kmasta> kitche

[04:39] <kmasta> kitche, this problem sucks, why would ubuntu do somethign like this, I thought they took care of everything when i did the upgrade
[04:39] <obo12> Xenguy: Yeah really neat.
[04:39] <swiz> neonempyr: ok, bb in roughly 5 or so
[04:39] <obo12> Now that I can't do it, I relize how much I miss it
[04:39] <MrProper_> kmasta, not really fglrx is a binary piece of poo
[04:40] <kitche> kmasta: well the binary drivers are like that for all the distros
[04:40] <neonempyr> Why does fglrx have to suck so much
[04:40] <Farnaby> Hrm, it appears that my xine libs got borked in the upgrade as well
[04:40] <MrProper_> kmasta, if you dont want to have to do this, just switch the driver to 'ati' instead of 'fglrx'
[04:40] <neonempyr> and Why did I buy a laptop with an ATI card in it?
[04:40] <kmasta> kitche: i tried that
[04:40] <MrProper_> neonempyr, well its made by ati thats explanation enough
[04:41] <kmasta> kitche, i was originally set to vesa, then I changed it to ATI
[04:41] <neonempyr> Couldn't have said it better
[04:41] <kitche> kmasta: well fglrx is not ati ati is Xorg
[04:41] <MrProper_> neonempyr, im just hoping the fact that amd bought them means changes for us
[04:41] <neonempyr> MrProper_, I'm hoping as well
[04:41] <Farnaby> argh, this screensaver issue is annoying
[04:42] <MrProper_> fglrx still comes from ati regardless of the fact that xorg package it
[04:42] <kmasta> kitche: i guess i'm just used to being spoiled with windows where when I update Idon't have change a bunch of stuff I had no idea I had to change when I upgrade
[04:42] <kitche> MrProper_: umm ati is xorg's open source wrapper
[04:42] <neonempyr> They're just scared they stepped on a patent
[04:42] <neonempyr> Anyone have any opinions on their favorite laptop in terms of compatibility with ubuntu?
[04:42] <student> hai felipe
[04:42] <MrProper_> kitche, we werent talking about the 'ati' driver, we were talking about the 'fglrx' driver
[04:43] <obo12> So do we have any VIM experts in the house?
[04:43] <necrite> hello
[04:43] <MrProper_> obo12, whats your prob?
[04:43] <student> are u shit in me?
[04:43] <Xenguy> obo12: check out #vim
[04:43] <kitche> MrProper_: umm ubuntu calls it xorg-driver-fglrx not Xorg Xorgh doesn't package fglrx
[04:43] <necrite> hello
[04:43] <student> hai

[04:44] <swiz> neonempyr: but now, i'm back in edgy and things seem to be working.  FM
[04:44] <nardis_miles> Has anyone looked at /etc/fstab in edgy? If so, do you understand how to edit it?
[04:44] <neonempyr> swiz: oh so you're working all right in edgy then?
[04:44] <kitche> MrProper_: yes it does but you got what I said wrong
[04:44] <obo12> MrProper_: It worked in Fedora, but won't in edgy
[04:44] <lazzareth> Gday
[04:44] <swiz> neonempyr: yeah, but its fkn magic.  i dont understand why it wasnt working before, but magically is now, after 3 reinstalls and a dozen or so reboots.
[04:44] <kmasta> question: why do I have to manually update fglrx, shouldn't that be something ubuntu takes care of when it tells me that it's updating everything for me
[04:44] <neonempyr> of course it doesn't really matter what wraps what does it?
[04:44] <MrProper_> kitche, hehe possibly, its been a long day
[04:44] <neonempyr> fglrx still pretty much sucks a butt
[04:45] <neonempyr> swiz: I had the same deal, couldn't pin it down
[04:45] <MrProper_> yeah
[04:45] <MrProper_> god i wish my work gave me an nvidia laptop.....ati just fuels my annoyances at them
[04:45] <swiz> kind of funny -- im trying to prepare a presentation for tomorrow, and this is the absolute worst time for something like this to happen.  i was more than a little peeved.  thanks for the help.
[04:45] <kmasta> oh hell yes, it works
[04:45] <neonempyr> swiz: was hoping we could figure something out; I'm sure it's something simple but deceptively...deceptive. glad it's working
[04:45] <whyameye> kmasta: what DID it do? switch you over to the ATI opensource drivers?
[04:46] <minerale> what's the name of the default ftp server that comes with ubuntu?
[04:46] <swiz> neonempyr: exactly.  and its not even something that you can easily google or look for.  i only found one pertinent response, and it was an unanswered forum thread regarding a similar issue.
[04:46] <Xenguy> minerale: I recommend vsftpd
[04:46] <kitche> whyameye: no kmasta had to reinstall fglrx since an upgrade changes kernel
[04:46] <neonempyr> All we can do is pray for the day that ATI and NVidia both will care that we get pissed off about this stuff. One solution: WORLD DOMINATION
[04:46] <Farnaby> also, if I don't get quark sorted I am going to get real peeved at NIN since thats all I have in OGG
[04:46] <whyameye> kitche: so it didn't change his xorg.conf file when he upgraded?
[04:47] <kitche> whyameye: no it did not
[04:47] <kmasta> kitche: WHY DIDN'T IT CHANGE THAT FILE
[04:47] <minerale> xenguy: I'm looking for the ftp serer with the lowest overheaed
[04:47] <Xenguy> minerale: it is very lean and fast
[04:47] <jvai> gn all, i gotta get home.
[04:47] <Xenguy> minerale: moreso than proftpd or wu
[04:48] <MrProper_> kitche, do this: aticonfig --initial && aticonfig enable
[04:48] <kitche> kmasta: well don't think the xorg package has a xorg.conf in it since it does autodetection
[04:49] <MrProper_> kitche, this will rewrite your xorg.conf to use the correct ati crap
[04:49] <kitche> MrProper_: sorry but I m a nvidia user :)
[04:49] <kmasta> kitche: what does that mean
[04:49] <MrProper_> oops that was meant for kmasta
[04:49] <MadHatte1> hey, has anyone put ubuntu on a dell latitude D820 before?
[04:49] <kmasta> kitche: why didn't the auto detection work
[04:49] <MrProper_> or whoever had the problem with fglrx
[04:50] <slappy1986> Can/Will anybody here help me with geting a wireless card working on my powerbook?
[04:50] <kmasta> yea,i had the problem with fglrx
[04:50] <kitche> kmasta: xorg will write it's own config if it doesn't see one already in /etc/X11 with vesa or ati depending if you had the ati driver installed
[04:50] <kmasta> and when i upgraded the kernel it forgot to cary over my xorg.conf file
[04:51] <kmasta> and when i upgraded the kernel it forgot to cary over my xorg.conf file
[04:51] <whyameye> does anybody use clamav and is there any point to using it?
[04:51] <kmasta> the xorg.conf that worked that is
[04:51] <kmasta> correct kitche?
[04:51] <kitche> kmasta: no your xorg.conf had fglrx which the new kernel didn't know that it was installed since it needs ot be compiled against the new kernel
[04:51] <MistaED> what the hell? ubuntu is stuffing around today i can't click on something properly until i go to like a tty and back to xorg and even then only some things will click

[04:53] <blaze> Hey, any ideas as to why I can not add multiverse repositories to my sources.list? They are refusing to connect for some reason
[04:53] <kmasta> it's not enough to know how to fix the problem, i wanna know what caused it
[04:53] <Xenguy> kmasta: relax, it takes months and years ;-)
[04:53] <MadHatte1> can anyone help me install drivers for my wireless card?
[04:53] <kmasta> xenguy, gotta start some where though right?
[04:53] <blaze> MadHatte1: you must be much more specific
[04:53] <Xenguy> kmasta: but you got the right idea :-)
[04:53] <UFO64> unless you can get an operator to DL the linux program right into your brain....

[04:54] <blaze> what sort of card?
[04:54] <dibblego> after upgrading 6.06 to 6.10, when I drag a window, it is very clunky and doesn't update properly - what might the problem be?
[04:54] <shebangbinbash> anyone have the ubuntu cert yet?
[04:54] <kmasta> so when the new kernel compiled, it didn't compile with the xorg.conf fromthe dapper kernel?
[04:54] <whyameye> kmasta: I think part of the issue is that fglrx is proprietary so ubuntu's support for it is probably a bit less than say the ATI open source drivers. If you were using the open source drivers when you upgraded, it would have been smoother. When using proprietary drivers, distros like ubuntu are more likely to crack.
[04:55] <MadHatte1> intel proset wireless 3945abg
[04:55] <kitche> kmasta: The reason a single binary driver will not work across a kernel series is the lack of internal API and ABI (application binary interface) compatibility in the kernel.
[04:55] <Ademan> this is the weakest thing ever, i tried to install the k3d package and the install script didn't work, and now i can't uninstall it either cause it wasnt to run the post-install script first
[04:55] <Xenguy> Ademan: edgy ?
[04:55] <slappy1986> anybody know how to get my laptop to detect my wireless card?
[04:55] <Ademan> yessir
[04:56] <Xenguy> Ademan: mmm
[04:56] <phargle> plug it in
[04:56] <slappy1986> 1150 delltruemobile, it says on the website its supported
[04:56] <slappy1986> it freezes if i put it in
[04:56] <slappy1986> and if i put it in and boot it don't finish booting lol
[04:56] <Ademan> the install script complained about a python version, so i figure it wants an older version (probably 2.3 or something) so i think i could get it to completely install, but is there any way to just cut it out?
[04:56] <kromel> Hello, I've done searches and tried to follow guides.  I recently installed Beryl which removed restricted.  Now my wireless no longer works.  Can someone point this newb in the right direction on how to get my wireless working again?  sorry for long post.
[04:56] <kmasta> kitche: but it wasn't like i changed it to fglrx when i first installed dapper, i just used what was ever default. why wouldn't that default config carryover, that seems like something you'd wanna make sure stayed the same between kernels
[04:57] <kitche> kmasta: it's a ubuntu thing but according to your Xorg.0.log use used binary drivers
[04:57] <Farnaby> I am sure I will return, just like Mcarthur

[05:00] <jordan> Xenguy: And the official way to upgrade with update-manager and no X is?
[05:00] <kmasta> nvm
[05:00] <iratsu> my computer is able to find a bluetooth device when running hcitool scan, but not while running hidd --search. is this normal?
[05:00] <kmasta> it has all become very clear
[05:00] <kmasta> thank you kitche
[05:01] <kitche> no problem kmasta
[05:02] <kitche> jordan: change your source.lst so dapper says edgy
[05:03] <kitche> jordan: then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:03] <jordan> kitche, But the wiki warns NOT to do that
[05:03] <w01> i am having trouble getting java on my machine any suggestions

[05:04] <kitche> jordan: then download the cd if you want to feel safe downloading the iso is good also
[05:04] <Gevaudan82> w01: why? just do sudo apt-get install sun-java5-sdk after enabling the extra repos
[05:05] <w01> can i multiverse and universe?
[05:05] <jordan> kitche: So the only way is to run the update script from the alternate cd?
[05:05] <w01> from the synoptic manger?
[05:05] <Gevaudan82> w01: add them...when in doubt follow the guide at ubuntuguide.org and add the repos mentioned in there...note that PLF is no longer maintained so comment that out as well as the last one in the list, the listiner repo or something like that
[05:05] <kitche> jordan: yeah if you want to feel safe
[05:06] <jordan> kitche: Thanks.
[05:06] <w01> ok thankyou!
[05:06] <Gevaudan82> w01: if you want or edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:06] <kitche> swiz: it's due to the fact that only root can do what you want try sudo su user_b and see if it will let you be user_b in your X

[05:07] <tag> that's as far as it gets
[05:07] <LinLenLap> I think the website figures if you're using linux, you'd know this.
[05:07] <LinLenLap> Can't find any info.
[05:07] <SlackRat> kitche, got bored in ##slackware? no problems to fix??  :P
[05:07] <swiz> kitche: i open a term as user _a_ while logged inas user _a_ via X, su - to root, and su to the different user, and attempt to start the gtk app.  no dice.
[05:07] <kitche> swiz: there is probably a way to do it with sudo but I m not a very knowledgeable person for sudo
[05:08] <swiz> kitche: that gives me some ideas i can try.  thanks.
[05:08] <MadHatte1> why does the command "make" not work?
[05:08] <LinLenLap> I've tried things like "paintball2.sh" from within the directory.
[05:08] <kitche> SlackRat no I been very bored in many distro channels but never get bored here :)
[05:08] <Gevaudan82> MadHatte1: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[05:08] <swiz> MadHatte1: last time i checked, make was not installed by default.  not since hoary, i believe.
[05:09] <LinLenLap> The creator, Jitspoe, emailed me once telling me how, and it was a simple thing, like unpack then type "xxxxxxx", but I don't remember what the command was and have lost the email.
[05:09] <MadHatte1> thank you very much
[05:09] <SlackRat> kitche.....and why is that?
[05:10] <LinLenLap> I came here to ask since I'm running excellent edgy and I think the issue is simply about making this file executable.
[05:10] <kitche> SlackRat: I hang out in a lot of the advance distro channels
[05:10] <flake> is there a way around the redraw problem when using wine
[05:10] <flake> and some gdi application
[05:11] <kitche> SlackRat: so I get bored since most of those channels there is no help and I don't like #gentoo that much so I don't go in that one
[05:11] <pixelPOET> LinLenLap, try sudo chmod +x [appname] 
[05:12] <neonempyr> Mindmap software?
[05:12] <LinLenLap> pixel: sudo chmod +x paintball2 returns no errors, after which "paintball2" returns nothing at all.
[05:12] <Gevaudan82> LinlenLap: are you typing ./paintball2 or paintball2...the former is correct
[05:13] <SlackRat> so youre giving back help to new users here cause the advanced distros generaally roll their own and dont have wall to wall newbs learning linux?
[05:13] <troopa> I try to install Ubuntu and the X server fails. I fix this by reconfiguring it and using the VESA driver. This starts X just fine, and I can even hear the music that the installation has. However, it seems to shut my LCD off (it just goes amber light and I can't see anything). I read some bug reports and tried commenting out some problematic modules X wants to load like they said, but nothing works.
[05:13] <Gevaudan82> meh ubuntu can be as advance as you want it to be...i choose it mainly for the hardware support
[05:13] <troopa> Does anyone else have problems getting Generic LCD displays working with Ubuntu?
[05:13] <pixelPOET> LinLenLap, chmod should output anything...
[05:14] <pixelPOET> ./paintball2 returns nothing at all?
[05:14] <Farnaby> Hrm, can't figure out why BioF is causing me such a headache
[05:14] <LinLenLap> Gevaudan82: I was typing the latter. The former attempts to run the program and then runs into some GL issues. I'll have to look into those on the forums since I'm just running a fresh install and haven't looked into my intel 915 driver much.
[05:15] <kitche> SlackRat: I give back to the community anyways I am a guru or dev for SourceMage
[05:15] <Gevaudan82> LinLenLap: try typing glxgears and see if it runs at full speed...might be an opengl issue
[05:15] <SlackRat> true, i like the ease of installation but spend a week trying to get it back to a more debian state, without all the gui clutter.....
[05:15] <pixelPOET> LinLenLap ... then the program will run once you get all your graphics drivers installed...
[05:16] <Gevaudan82> SlackRat: do you even use a GUI?
[05:16] <LinLenLap> GLXGEARS returns: .libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b
[05:16] <SlackRat> but so far ,  advanced configures in ubunt work, unlike a few other distros....heh, i use a gui all the time.....its what my consoles open on and i can move em all round
[05:16] <SlackRat> lol
[05:16] <Gevaudan82> LinLenLap: you don't have your graphics driver installed or your card does not support opengl/3d rendering
[05:16] <LinLenLap> I don't want to bother you or pixel anymore...I'm gonna try to work the driver thing out on my own first. Many thanks for getting me going though!
[05:16] <slappy1986> anybody here know how to go back to earlier kernels and such? Ithink thats the only way to get my wireless card to work
[05:17] <pixelPOET> LinLenLap, it's no bother... thats what this channels for :D
[05:17] <LinLenLap> isn't there a command to test if open gl is working?
[05:17] <LinLenLap> opengl
[05:17] <LinLenLap> glfx
[05:17] <pixelPOET> usually its glxgears ;)
[05:17] <pixelPOET> so based on that its a good assumption that yours isnt.
[05:17] <Gevaudan82> slappy1986: glxgears...if you don't see gears spinning in real time it's not working
[05:17] <damian_> hi, im just wondering where the config file for ->menu->Administration->networking is located, i enter my dns into the box to get my internet working but next boot it hasnt saved, very frustrating!
[05:18] <kitche> SlackRat: yeah I only use a gui really is to browse the web since some pages are hard to read on links
[05:18] <LinLenLap> OK...yeah, I see the gears turning...not sure how fast they're supposed to go, but they're moving pretty quick.
[05:18] <Gevaudan82> damian_: a number of places.../etc/network/interfaces is one
[05:18] <LinLenLap> ah, glxinfo

[05:19] <damian_> but will these files affect gtk applications?
[05:19] <Xenguy> ianmacgregor: some players will play that already...
[05:20] <Gevaudan82> EchoBinary: if i were you i'd use acronis on the windows boxes to backup to ubuntu via samba...there's always rsync but there's a lot of complexity involved
[05:20] <Xenguy> ianmacgregor: otherwise you can convert to DVD format
[05:20] <ianmacgregor> Xenguy: Mine won't :(
[05:20] <ianmacgregor> Xenguy: How would I do that?
[05:20] <flake> ..
[05:20] <EchoBinary> Gevaudan82: is acronis free?

[05:23] <kitche> SlackRat: see I mostly use my linux box for java programming and ircing really
[05:24] <Gevaudan82> damian_: i can't remember honestly...know that in ubuntu if you are using dhcp you won't be able to permanently set your dns...it will default to your router...change it to static ips and then your dns sticks

[06:06] <Farnaby> sorry lathiat, went to smoke to try and get a bit less pissed off.
[06:06] <Legendre> wheelswitch - is the method broken for 6.10?
[06:06] <sanmarcos> chris86wm: you have to relogin, if it doenst, then tough shit, have fun

[06:24] <^Ocean^> knapper, you need to install the restricted kernel modules for ur kernal
[06:24] <^Ocean^> or you can install the nvidia drivers from there website
[06:24] <rawrness> I am just reinstalling :p cause of my drivers
[06:24] <rawrness> and KDE and GNome not liking each other
[06:24] <^Ocean^> no they dont lol
[06:25] <rpk180> I upgraded to edgy a few days ago.  Everything went smoothly.  However, emacs looks terrible now -- the font seems smaller and harder to read.  Any suggestions on how to go about making it look good again?
[06:25] <rawrness> I have got KDM runing in gnome thought :P
[06:25] <rawrness> Use the Bleeper instead!
[06:26] <Adammk> i run linux on my laptop and want to run a linux program (Amarok) on my Windows Xp desktop computer. how should i do this? is Cgywin the best solution?
[06:26] <Farnaby> I also seem to keep getting a number of sleeping biof processes
[06:26] <rawrness> Anyways i want to make a vmware machine for my windows
[06:26] <Legendre> Adammk - is there a cygwin port of Amarok?
[06:26] <knapper> ^Ocean^ ok, well I don't find them in the repository. uname -r = 2.6.17-10-386
[06:27] <knapper> 2.6.15 is what I find
[06:27] <knapper> or is it linux-restricted-modules-386?
[06:27] <lrep> hi, where does the c header files get installed in ubuntu?
[06:27] <rawrness> but i don't got a windows install disk
[06:27] <lrep> i've installed the kernel source already
[06:27] <rawrness> just a emachine sys restore
[06:28] <kitche> lrep: it's looking for the linux-headers
[06:28] <lrep> kitche, come again.
[06:29] <Adammk> i don't think so. i'm currently trying to compile from source, but it says "The important program kde-config was not found" any idea where to get this? I've tryed to install kdebase, but oddly it says the same thing
[06:29] <kitche> lrep: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.17-10
[06:29] <Legendre> Adammk - you're in tough shape.
[06:30] <knapper> What repository can I find linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386?
[06:30] <lrep> kitche, i'm installing vmware and it asked me for the C header files...do i still need to get the linux-headers?
[06:30] <ArrenLex> Adammk: do you have kdebase-dev installed?
[06:30] <mohaghna111> hi guys
[06:30] <Adammk> Legendre: i'd really *like* to get amarok to work on windows...
[06:30] <Legendre> Adammk - Amarok must dep on KDE stuff.. not a happy situation for cygwin.
[06:30] <kitche> lrep: they are the same thing
[06:30] <ArrenLex> !linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386
[06:30] <ubotu> linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386: Non-free Linux 2.6.17 modules on 386. In component restricted, is optional. Version 2.6.17.5-11 (edgy), package size 7701 kB, installed size 20892 kB
[06:31] <Adammk> Legendre: yep it does say Amarok is for KDE
[06:31] <Legendre> I haven't done much cygwin in the last few years, but that situation sounds fairly unworkable to me.
[06:31] <ArrenLex> Adammk: Amarok does not and will never work on Windows. The developers have blankly refused to port it.
[06:31] <Adammk> dang it
[06:31] <Legendre> you'd need to have the whole required KDE framework built for a cygwin environment.
[06:31] <lrep>  okay kitche where are the headers stored?
[06:31] <rawrness> Amarok works real buggy in gnome
[06:31] <lrep> /usr/src/linux/include ?
[06:31] <nothlit> http://kde-cygwin.sourceforge.net/
[06:31] <rawrness> Mine don't even dock :P
[06:32] <knapper> ArrenLex: Check amarok's website. They said in the latest news entry that a windows port will be released soon.
[06:32] <kitche> lrep: you can point vmware there as well
[06:32] <Legendre> nothlit - lol. that's just wrong..
[06:32] <rawrness> window port ummmm
[06:32] <nothlit> ^^
[06:32] <lrep> kitche, that's where vmware is looking for...but there's nothing there
[06:33] <ArrenLex> Oh. Wow, I guess I was wrong. Sorry, carry on. xd
[06:33] <ArrenLex> xD
[06:33] <lrep> kitche, i'm trying to locate the files so ican tell vmware where to use them
[06:33] <kitche> lrep yes install the linux-headers but the dev package
[06:33] <lrep> ok
[06:34] <nothlit> why can't you just aptitude install linux-headers-`uname -r`
[06:34] <SinnerG> How do I create a patch like oldfolder > newfolder  anyone knows?
[06:34] <knapper> Adammk, ArrenLex: amarok.kde.com: "Amarok 2 will be based on QT4/KDE4 and will finally feature a Windows port, so for those of you that must use Windows, you will finally be able to have your rok and eat it too."
=== Deaigo42 is now known as Deaigo
[06:34] <ArrenLex> knapper: yes, I saw it
[06:34] <knapper> I think its terrible
[06:34] <magicnorri> user-land cannot rm directory
[06:35] <knapper> :/
[06:35] <Adammk> knapper: cool but i'll try anyway in the meantime
[06:35] <nothlit> How far is QT4/KDE4 away anyways
[06:35] <ArrenLex> nothlit: Maybe Q3 2007?
[06:35] <Gumby> why is it terrible to have a linux app ported to windows?
[06:36] <nothlit> ArrenLex, ahh, ty
[06:36] <Gumby> just cause a person uses windows doesnt mean they should have to be a slave to iTunes and Windows Media
[06:36] <Rappermas> hey, are the repos broken again?
[06:36] <Legendre> Gumby - it's not.. but trying to make windows into a KDE friendly envirnoment sounds like self-abuse.
[06:37] <Rappermas> compiz won't install on edgy
[06:37] <nothlit> Gumby, i don't think its the porting that is so horrible, look at gaim/gimp/inkscape... but the idea of the necessity to port linux apps to windows is
[06:37] <Rappermas> says dependencies are missing
[06:37] <Legendre> I mean, KDE can't even get along with a lot of shiat on Linux.. and that's all open API :)
[06:37] <dabaR> Yeah the repos are down
[06:37] <Chippy> Rappermas: I had the same problem, so I just installed beryl :)
[06:37] <Gumby> Legendre:  its not kde, its amarok that is being ported
[06:37] <Rappermas> Chippy: ok, i'll bite, how do i get beryl?
[06:38] <Rappermas> so i get a brand new card to use XGL and the repos are down, somehow, i'm not surprised
[06:38] <Chippy> Rappermas: that depends.  jump into the #ubuntu-xgl and I'll help you out there
[06:38] <lrep> kitche, ok thanks i got it
[06:38] <nothlit> Rappermas, depends on your hardware and whether you want xgl or aixgl
[06:38] <Gumby> nothlit: if anything, it will make more people realize that they are slaves to MS and Apple and that there are alternatives out there.
[06:38] <nothlit> aiglx*
[06:38] <magicnorri> can anyone tell me how to delete a hidden directory
[06:38] <Gumby> I say good on the Amarok people for doing it.
[06:38] <pibarnas> gnome-settings-manager can't record my settings on Edgy... can you help me?!?
[06:38] <Adammk> sorry, i tried to convince my family to use ubuntu on our main household computer, but they like windows cause they know (for the most part) how to use it
[06:38] <Gumby> magicnorri: rm -Rf .directory
[06:38] <Rav|strangler> Rappermas, v
[06:38] <magicnorri> thank you
[06:39] <fignew> XGL = :( ... aiglx = :)
[06:39] <nothlit> Gumby, the problem is people don't really realise that a lot of programs can be run from linux or were originally from...
[06:39] <Gumby> magicnorri: assuming you have permissions to do so
[06:39] <Rav|strangler> Rappermas, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=127090
[06:39] <Chippy> Rav|strangler: he disappeared :)
[06:39] <Gumby> nothlit: when they visit the downloads page for the application they just might
[06:40] <knapper> What repository can I find linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386?
[06:40] <Rav|strangler> ohhh lag
[06:40] <Rappermas> see this is why i'm asking
[06:40] <Rappermas> xgl just crashed on me
[06:40] <Rappermas> lol that's fun
[06:40] <Rav|strangler> did you try ubuntu-xgl
[06:40] <Rav|strangler> or wait
[06:40] <Legendre> I'll ask again: Anyone have success using a USB flash drive as install media?
[06:40] <Rappermas> yeah i just joined
[06:41] <Rav|strangler> ih oh ok
[06:41] <Rappermas> hopefully, i won't crash again
[06:41] <Rav|strangler> I didnt get much help
[06:41] <Legendre> the CD on my lappy is flaked out, and I need to install from a USB stick.
[06:41] <Rav|strangler> I didnt get it working on my ati laptop
[06:41] <nothlit> Gumby, yes, but to tell people don't really see what they aren't looking for. i was ecstatic to find that almost all m essential applications could run on linux, but it didn't really happen until i was already burning install/livecds
[06:41] <Rav|strangler> I'm going to try on my dekstop tomorrow
[06:41] <towsonu2003> Legendre, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=80811 maybe can help
[06:42] <nothlit> Legendre, i thinks theres a guide to it, i'll look for it
[06:43] <Gumby> nothlit: I understand.  My only point really is that I cant see how a linux based app ported to windows is a bad thing as long as its a full featured application and not a stripped down POS.  I find it especially good because of the lack of applications, good or bad, that windows users have to use for audio.  I've used iTunes,  I dont understand how people put up with it.
[06:43] <towsonu2003> nothlit, I just posted an ubuntuforums link above :)
[06:43] <boni> !edgy eft
[06:43] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[06:43] <Legendre> nothlit - the community guide is not working for me..
[06:43] <azureal> hi, ubuntu server edition is REGPARM or NOREGPARM?
[06:44] <towsonu2003> Gumby, I'm just jumping in, but porting linux apps to windows actually makes switching much easier for users: it gives you common apps so you're familiar to some degree
[06:44] <nothlit> towsonu2003, ahh kk
[06:44] <Legendre> towsonu2003 - I don't want ubuntu installed to the flash drive.. I want to boot from the flash drive, and install onto the HD.
[06:44] <boni> hi everyone
[06:44] <threat2> hi
[06:45] <DarkMageZ> Gumby, i love iTunes, cept for the iPod handling... sure it works, but it's annoying
[06:45] <threat2> what ales you boni?
[06:46] <towsonu2003> Legendre, what about this http://wiki.koeln.ccc.de/index.php?title=Ubuntu_USB_Install
[06:46] <nothlit> Legendre, oh, well I'm not really familiar with that sort of installation, are you trying towsonu2003 's link?
[06:46] <DarkMageZ> Gumby, what media player do you use?
[06:46] <towsonu2003> !ping
[06:46] <nothlit> Gumby, what are your opinions on winamp and foobar
[06:46] <ubotu> ping: connection timeout
[06:46] <azureal> how can i tell if my kernel is REGPARM or NOREGPARM...?
[06:47] <MicrosoftSpy> Does anyone know how you put the speaker icon back on the app bar ? I tried right clicking and add but it doesnt seem to be there
[06:47] <rpk180> Does anyone have emacs21 installed in 6.10?  Does it look crappy in X-windows for you too?  Any ideas on how to make it look good again?
[06:47] <Farnaby> wow, now I have a whole new problem, and its a biggy
[06:47] <kitche> MicrosoftSpy: add your mixer app back to the panel
[06:47] <MicrosoftSpy> Ahhh thatd do it kitchie :) Thanks bud
[06:48] <towsonu2003> MicrosoftSpy, Add>volume control -that's what you're looking for
[06:48] <Farnaby> ... I did a restart and now its saying that xserver is not configged properly and then it dumps me to a command line
[06:48] <nothlit> MicrosoftSpy, you couldn't re-add the applet?
=== lastnode__ is now known as lastnode
[06:49] <towsonu2003> how many ghosts did you have, lol
[06:49] <MicrosoftSpy> noth..nope how do you reconfigure sound ?
[06:49] <unfo> Farnaby, what changes did you make since your last reboot?
[06:49] <MicrosoftSpy> appart from system prefs sound
[06:49] <rpk180> I tried doing a "dpkg-reconfigure emacs21", but it didn't help...
[06:49] <unfo> Farnaby,  e.g. what new stuff did you install / change? :)
[06:50] <nothlit> Farnaby, have you looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[06:50] <unfo> Bin, hello :)
[06:50] <Farnaby> Thats a very good question but i can't tell you since I can't even really seem to login
[06:50] <Gumby> nothlit: I havnt used winamp for ages and Ive never heard of foobar.  Winamp used to be good before AOL bought it.  AFter that it just became bloated
[06:50] <unfo> Bin, you probably should change your nickname. type: /nick NICKNAME
[06:51] <unfo> choose a good nick for your NICKNAME.
[06:51] <nothlit> Gumby, AOL is evil
[06:51] <Gumby> DarkMageZ: I use Amarok
[06:51] <MicrosoftSpy> Anyone know how to get ubuntu to redetect sound ?
=== Bin is now known as Poseidon
[06:51] <Farnaby> all it really does is dump me to a flashing curser and nothing seems to work
[06:51] <towsonu2003> Legendre, be careful not to bork your grub by the way
[06:51] <Gumby> nothlit: no kidding.  The took a great simple media player and made it into something just awful
[06:51] <nothlit> Farnaby, i thought you said you were dumped into a command line
[06:52] <unfo> Poseidon, so now you're in IRC for the first time :) this is where many people discuss Ubuntu. and there is stuff both in English and in Chinese.
[06:52] <unfo> !zh
[06:52] <ubotu> For Ubuntu help in Chinese  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[06:52] <unfo> Poseidon: :-)
[06:52] <Farnaby> I thought I was at first now I am not so sure.
[06:52] <Poseidon> oh thanks
[06:52] <unfo> Farnaby, you have no clue what you changed?
[06:52] <DarkMageZ> Gumby, thought so :) there seems to be some sort of split. some peoples minds work one way, the others the other way.
[06:52] <unfo> Poseidon, but stay here :)
[06:52] <towsonu2003> MicrosoftSpy, sudo alsaconf maybe? but that's maybe! and probably incorrect. are you sure you can't add the volume control applet to the panel (right click on panel > add > volume control)
[06:52] <nothlit> Gumby, oh foobar is supposed to be the serious audio app or something its pretty customisable and can grab direct control of the sound card before windows sound mixer remixes it
[06:53] <Gumby> DarkMageZ: try AMarok for two weeks then go back t iTunes, I bet you'll hate it then :)
[06:53] <Farnaby> unfo, I re-ran xserver-xorg (which is the root of my problem i am sure)
[06:53] <nothlit> Gumby, more serious audio codec support and stuff
[06:53] <Gumby> nothlit: cool
[06:53] <unfo> Farnaby, i agree. :-) what does re-ran mean?
[06:53] <DarkMageZ> Gumby, i had Amarok for a month
[06:53] <oranged> anyone having pgp errors when apt-get update is run?
[06:53] <MicrosoftSpy> towsonu: Yeah when i try to add the volume control it returns 'the panel encountered a problem when loading OFAIID GNOME_MixerApplet'
[06:54] <towsonu2003> Farnaby, unfo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I guess?
[06:54] <nothlit> Farnaby, are you saying you have two instances of Xorg open?
[06:54] <DarkMageZ> Gumby, some people are iTunes/rhythmbox people. others are ?/Amarok people
[06:54] <Farnaby> unfo, it had misdetected some stuff on the autodetect, namely the fact that some graphics where borked
[06:54] <unfo> borked?
[06:54] <Farnaby> towsonu2003 yes
[06:54] <Farnaby> nothlit, I have 0 instances open
[06:54] <Gumby> DarkMageZ: I guess so.  rhythmbox and iTunes just seem so limited to me
[06:54] <Poseidon> are you often be here unfo?
[06:54] <nothlit> Does anyone have an opinion on Songbird? the new mozilla app?
[06:54] <Adammk> guys, Legendre, ArrenLex, knapper, nothlit, it still says "The important program kde-config was not found"
[06:54] <unfo> Poseidon, not here in #ubuntu, but sometimes in #debian or #debian-devel
[06:55] <unfo> I am a big debian fan.
[06:55] <Gumby> anyhow, its time to pack and see if everything fit into my travel pack. heading to Perth in 5 days.  woohoo!!
[06:55] <unfo> Gumby, cool
[06:55] <nothlit> Adammk, a console doesnt have a cursor, anyways... ctrl+alt+f1      aptitude show kde-config
[06:55] <nomasteryoda> nothlit, i have used songbird, but its not fast enough for my use...
[06:55] <threat2> Gumby: woot
[06:55] <unfo> oranged, apt-get uses pgp to verify that all your packages were downloaded ok and not tampered with
[06:55] <DarkMageZ> Gumby, limited?
[06:55] <threat2> Gumby: say hi to quantumn for me
[06:55] <unfo> oranged, but pgp does not always work perfectly :-)
[06:55] <unfo> oranged, I would ignore the errors.
[06:56] <unfo> Poseidon, did you try installing ubuntu?
[06:56] <Poseidon> not yet
[06:56] <Poseidon> I have something to do
[06:56] <unfo> Poseidon, you said you wanted to learn more, and that's the first step to it :)
[06:57] <unfo> you mean something else to do?
[06:57] <Adammk> nothlit: Cgywin is pretty basic, it says aptitude isn't a command
[06:57] <oranged> unfo; it actually completely screws using automatix..
[06:57] <Poseidon> for instance HTML
[06:57] <Poseidon> or c++
[06:57] <unfo> oranged, i don't know much about automatix.
[06:57] <nothlit> Adammk, oh yeah sorry, you're in cygwin
[06:57] <oranged> unfo,  Internal error: Good signature, but could not determine key fingerprint?!
[06:57] <unfo> Poseidon, you mean for school?
[06:57] <MicrosoftSpy> Hmmm alsaconf not found you sure thats the right command ?
[06:57] <oranged> unfo, its still not something i'd like to ignore
[06:57] <unfo> oranged, i would see if it's a known bug in automatix.
[06:58] <DarkMageZ> oranged, automatrix is not supported, and seriously disliked by the ubuntu devs. try a clean install of the system
[06:58] <oranged> unfo, i've been in #automatix discussing the problem.. it seems to be a problem with gpg
[06:58] <Adammk> any ideas?
[06:58] <unfo> oranged, check for bug reports in launchpad and/or at the automatix site.
[06:58] <unfo> DarkMageZ, I heard that automatix is now dpkg-based.
[06:58] <Poseidon> no exactly   I am interest in that
[06:59] <nothlit> Legendre, did you make sure your usb drive either supports usb-hdd or usb-zip?
[06:59] <oranged> unfo, already done. :)
[06:59] <unfo> Poseidon, a good way to learn C++ is to install Ubuntu. it comes with a C++ compiler easily available.
[06:59] <MicrosoftSpy> Anyone know how to reconfigure sound ?
[06:59] <Farnaby> we will see if this fixes things... I can only hope
[06:59] <crimsun> MicrosoftSpy: in what sense?
[06:59] <oranged> unfo, it really has more to do with gpg then automatix. ;)
[06:59] <rawrness> How can i make windows work in vmware?
[06:59] <DarkMageZ> unfo, i've been suspecting that as well. but the ubuntu devs still say it's bad. i might nuke a testbox with it laterz
[07:00] <unfo> rawrness, easy, just stick in the Windows CD-ROM when VMware is booting.
[07:00] <MicrosoftSpy> crim when i try to add the volume control it returns 'the panel encountered a problem when loading OFAIID GNOME_MixerApplet'. I tried deleting the sound card from the hardware list but it wont let me do it
[07:00] <oranged> DarkMageZ, why do ubuntu devs think its bad?
[07:00] <threat2> MicrosoftSpy: your secret is safe with me
[07:00] <unfo> DarkMageZ, good plan.
[07:00] <jon_> Can someone help, how do I found out what services are running in ubunutu?
[07:01] <Farnaby> which makes typig hard
[07:01] <DarkMageZ> oranged, it used to break systems, i can't verify if it still does
[07:01] <MicrosoftSpy> threat...Thanks bud :) will be sure to let the the big B know
[07:01] <unfo> jon_: why are you curious? :)
[07:01] <Poseidon> oh really !!?as a matter of fact ,I am not familiar with Linux Cmd.
[07:01] <threat2> jon_: netstat -l
[07:01] <threat2> jon_: ps aux
[07:01] <Gevaudan82> jon_: ps -e
[07:01] <crimsun> MicrosoftSpy: what do you mean by "add the volume control"?
[07:01] <Farnaby> Bloody hell
[07:01] <jon_> I'm curious, as I can't get an ircd to let incoming connections in, but as far as I was aware I had no firewall
[07:01] <oranged> DarkMageZ, it hasn't broken anything on this fresh install.. just apt refuses to install packages it can't verify
[07:02] <MicrosoftSpy> crimsum: Right click on task bar to add the volume control to the task bar
[07:02] <chuckyp> !iptables > jon_
[07:02] <unfo> Poseidon, you do not have to know any commands. you can use the Anjuta IDE. it lets you click a button to compile your code.
[07:02] <ixian_> has anyone tried easyubuntu on ubuntu 6.10? does it work?
[07:02] <unfo> ixian_, check the website for updates :)
[07:02] <chuckyp> ixian_, its not recomended or supported here
[07:02] <jon_> chuckyp, yes I've allowed all the relevent ports through iptables and there are no rejected ports, but still no luck
[07:02] <MicrosoftSpy> ixian_: I use automatix and it seems to work ok, but alot of folks don't seem to like it
[07:02] <unfo> !easyubuntu
[07:02] <ubotu> easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ (currently down!); for help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu.
[07:03] <nothlit> jon_, ubuntu doesn't come default with a firewall enabled, to check services theres system -> administration -> services for a "safety" sort of stupid users service management, or you can install the package bum (boot up manager)
[07:03] <Poseidon> ok I will try it
[07:03] <jon_> I will have a look, thanks
[07:03] <unfo> ixian_, easyubuntu is supported in the easyubuntu channel :)
[07:03] <ixian_> i was asking if anyone here has actually tried it.
[07:03] <crimsun> MicrosoftSpy: so there's no volume icon already?
[07:03] <sethk> MicrosoftSpy, it has a habit of breaking things.  Considered more dangerous.  Nevertheless can be useful.
[07:03] <Poseidon> what about Visual studio2005  Unfo?
[07:04] <Gevaudan82> jon_: if you want a firewall install firestarter or guarddog if your needs are basic...for advanced configuration with a gui use webmin
[07:04] <unfo> Poseidon, doesnt work on Linux.
[07:04] <iloveubunut> anyone good at troubleshooting sound?
[07:04] <unfo> Poseidon, linux has Anjuta and Emacs.
[07:04] <rawrness> unfo:  Don't have a windows install cd
[07:04] <unfo> iloveubunut, just ask :)
[07:04] <unfo> rawrness, get Vista Beta 2.
[07:04] <RancidLM> ubuntu looks bad at 1680x1050  is there a way to fix the fonts for this resolution i would really like to utilize the full  resolution of this monitor?
[07:04] <MicrosoftSpy> crimsun: Nope Under system->Pref-> sound I cant seem to get it to set sound capture back to auto....dunno what I did to it
[07:04] <Lathiat> RancidLM: whats "bad" about it?
[07:04] <iloveubunut> just got 6.10 and I have no sound =(
[07:04] <rawrness> unfo: Don't think my computer could run bista
[07:04] <threat2> Poseidon: there is mono, but it is only .NET 2003, not 2005
[07:04] <Lathiat> RancidLM: you can turn the DPI up if thast what you mean
[07:04] <unfo> rawrness, :(
[07:04] <Lathiat> RancidLM: system->preferneces->fonts ---> advanced
[07:05] <rawrness> STupid shitty emachine
[07:05] <jon_> I don't want a firewall, I want to be able to allow incoming connections from the internet, the program is set up correctly as it runs fine on my other box (not ubunutu) but it won't on ubuntu, any ideas?
[07:05] <chuckyp> !ircd
[07:05] <ubotu> ircd: IRC Server daemon - dummy package. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.0 (edgy), package size 6 kB, installed size 36 kB
[07:05] <Gevaudan82> jon_: do you have a hardware router/firewall?
[07:05] <unfo> rawrness, are you at a college or university with MSDNAA?
[07:05] <jon_> nope, and I'm runnning unbuntu 5.04
[07:05] <MicrosoftSpy> jon_ you can still run a firewall and allow incoming connections you just gotta configure it correctly
[07:05] <jon_> it's just my Modem from comp to wall thing
[07:05] <chuckyp> jon_, do you have a broadband router or something?
[07:05] <RancidLM> Lathiat: u "L" pritty much disapear.. and the text is very distorted
[07:05] <unfo> Poseidon, Anjuta is easy and powerful, and Emacs is difficult but ultra-powerful.
[07:05] <jon_> no it's a cable modem
[07:05] <Poseidon> threat2   what's the meaning of mono
[07:05] <Lathiat> RancidLM: hrm.. weird.
[07:06] <Lathiat> RancidLM: i dont have that problem onh my 1680x1050 screen
[07:06] <towsonu2003> MicrosoftSpy, okay I think I found something here... first: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade, try if it works, if not try this: launch synaptic, search for gnome-applets and gnome-applets-data - I found this here: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-25259.html
[07:06] <chuckyp> jon_, just make sure in your cable modem config that the ports are forwarded for ircd is all.
[07:06] <Lathiat> RancidLM: or is that the incorrect resolutions for your display?
[07:06] <unfo> jon_: does 5.04 still get security updates?
[07:06] <threat2> Poseidon: it is the name of an IDE for C#
[07:06] <RancidLM> Lathiat: u using vga cords? or dvi?
[07:06] <chuckyp> unfo, not anymore.
[07:06] <Lathiat> unfo: no, 5.04 is hoary which is EOL
[07:06] <MicrosoftSpy> thanks tow....will try
[07:06] <Lathiat> RancidLM: thats in a laptop actually
[07:06] <unfo> Lathiat, ah
[07:06] <jon_> unfo, I don't know lol =P
[07:06] <unfo> Jon_, it is risky to run end-of-lifed old versions.
[07:06] <Lathiat> RancidLM: probably dvi equivalent
[07:07] <RancidLM> Lathiat: hmm i wounder if its because im going analog back to digital.. hmm
[07:07] <jon_> chuckyp, how can I do that? there's no router or anything so I'm unsure. Is it a ubuntu program?
[07:07] <threat2> Poseidon: for firewall there is a program named firestarter, it is a frontend for iptables, it is good
[07:07] <towsonu2003> MicrosoftSpy, okay I just saw I posted missing info heheh after searching for the packages, reinstall them :)
[07:07] <jon_> how do I forward the ports?
[07:07] <rawrness> unfo: nope just at home
[07:07] <MicrosoftSpy> tow: yep will read da URL :)
[07:08] <Poseidon> really?firestarter
[07:08] <Jrua> guys
[07:08] <unfo> rawrness, how do you feel about spending $30-$50 online for Win98 or Windows NT 4?
[07:08] <rawrness> So I take it i am fucked and have to continue dual booting?
[07:08] <nmz> is there no 'more advanced' audio control? master equilizer, etc.
[07:08] <unfo> rawrness, ah, you need to set up physical disk access.
[07:08] <towsonu2003> here's the google search i did: http://www.google.com/search?num=20&hl=en&safe=off&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=GNOME+Mixer+Applet+OAFIID&spell=1
[07:08] <rawrness> ?
[07:08] <jon_> any ideas chuckyp or unfo?
[07:08] <unfo> rawrness, go to irc.efnet.org channel #vmware and ask how to use /dev/hda1 as your VMWare HDD
[07:08] <towsonu2003> MicrosoftSpy, here's the google search i did: http://www.google.com/search?num=20&hl=en&safe=off&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=GNOME+Mixer+Applet+OAFIID&spell=1 , in case you need to check out more links there
[07:09] <unfo> jon_, maybe ask in channel ##networking
[07:09] <puppy> hi , i want to add the ubunyu Cd to apt/sources - how do i do that?
[07:09] <chuckyp> jon_, you would have to look at the directions for your cable modem.  Try navigating your browser to 192.168.0.1 for the config or possibly 192.168.1.1  depends on the router.  But it could blocking certain ports.
[07:09] <Jrua> guys I am facing a problem in efgy, when i use gdesklets it utilizes the whole memory.. is this a bug
[07:09] <Jrua> edy*
[07:09] <rawrness> kk
[07:09] <Jrua> guys I am facing a problem in efgy, when i use gdesklets it utilizes the whole memory..

[07:09] <chuckyp> !easycources > puppy
[07:09] <jon_> ok thankyou chuckyp, I'll have a look
[07:09] <crimsun> MicrosoftSpy: first, does sound actually work in any app?
[07:10] <unfo> Poseidon, try anjuta. it's quite good. :)
[07:10] <unfo> do you have a computer you can install Ubuntu on?
[07:11] <unfo> Jon_, or maybe 192.168.2.1
[07:11] <iter> why is automatix "
[07:11] <iter> seriously disliked by the devs"
[07:11] <threat2> Poseidon: yes
[07:11] <puppy> chuckyp, what do u mean?
[07:11] <threat2> Poseidon: apt-get install firestarter to install it
[07:12] <omac> jon: what kind of router have you got?  after connecting your router to the modem, did you do /etc/init.d/networking restart?
=== ps22 is now known as pc
[07:12] <Poseidon> No I dont know what should i do
[07:12] <jon_> omac, it auto recognised it and I don't have router, it's a cable modem
[07:12] <nmz> automatix is what?
[07:12] <chuckyp> !easysources | puppy
[07:12] <ubotu> puppy: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:12] <iter> see I don't really buy that
[07:12] <Poseidon> use  vm?
[07:12] <towsonu2003> iter, it causes problems with dist-upgrades, and also it had issues with licensing and security, but I dont think they "seriously" dislike it. at worst, they don't do it :)
=== pc is now known as pc22
[07:13] <towsonu2003> !automatix
[07:13] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[07:13] <unfo> jon_, ask in channel ##networking for help with finding out if your cable modem has a router built in. they can help you use a traceroute tool to find out.
[07:13] <unfo> Poseidon, no, use dual-boot.
[07:13] <towsonu2003> iter, it seems this channel doesn't like it though :)))
[07:13] <unfo> Poseidon, do you have a laptop?
[07:13] <iter> 00:58 < DarkMageZ> oranged, automatrix is not supported, and seriously disliked by the ubuntu devs. try a clean install of the system
[07:14] <omac> jon: what is the manufacturer and model name and number of your cable modem?
[07:14] <iter> right but for what reason
[07:14] <puppy> ubotu, thanks
[07:14] <ubotu> Thanks for the help!
[07:14] <DarkMageZ> iter, cause it has a reputation for breaking systems
[07:14] <DarkMageZ> iter, a well deserved rep. things might have changed in the newer versions tho
[07:14] <RancidLM> the ubuntu startup screen doesn't work with my lcd mointor after grub loads it just goes blank until gdm loads.. the only way currently to see if things are loading correctly is to remove "splash" from loading my kernel  how do i enable splash on a lcd monitor?
[07:14] <iter> I would argue that the population using automatix is prone to breakage
[07:15] <Poseidon> I am just afraid it is not steady  My laptop is a bad

[07:15] <chuckyp> iter, it is a hacked way of installing stuff that is very to easy to install without even using it.   If you check out the wiki or the desktop guide you will be able to get everything going without using it.
[07:15] <unfo> Poseidon, what does "a bad" mean?
[07:15] <iter> chuckyp: how is it hacked
[07:15] <fatlip> i lost the link to flash 9 beta
[07:15] <fatlip> :(
[07:15] <iter> it installs everything the debian way
[07:15] <chuckyp> iter, hacked up way of doing it.
[07:15] <khaije1> a philosophical question, for a personal use server does the extra testing of dapper outweigh the progress made with edgy?
[07:15] <Jrua> anyone understood my problem
[07:15] <omac> Tonight, I managed to try xdvdshrink on Edgy Eft, after installing dvdread and doing a ./install.sh for the css.  DVD was ripped, resized and burned in 32minutes :)
[07:15] <iter> chuckyp: a shell script is 'hacked' ?
[07:15] <chuckyp> iter, it downloads source for some packages and others it apt-gets from non ubuntu repositories
[07:15] <unfo> fatlip, why do you want flash9?
[07:15] <omac> Eft rocks!
[07:16] <Poseidon> it dose't work well
[07:16] <fatlip> so i can watch flash videos? lol
[07:16] <Jrua> guys I am facing a problem in edgy, when i use gdesklets it utilizes the whole memory.. is this a bug ?
[07:16] <iter> chuckyp: as opposed to using apt-get ?
[07:16] <fatlip> it was working well on my old install
[07:16] <iter> going to be hitting same repos w/that
[07:16] <iter> yeah beryl is so pretty
[07:16] <rawrness> beryl is very pretty
[07:16] <iter> I love mousewheel near edge of screen
[07:16] <khaije1> MicrosoftSpy: definitely!
[07:16] <omac> DVDrip on Edgy Eft has no issues after installing libdvdread and then doing the ./install.sh for the css also :)
[07:16] <towsonu2003> khaije1, I would use Dapper for a server... well, I would use Debian stable for a server, but thats just me :)
[07:17] <chuckyp> iter, NON UBUNTU REPOS is the key portion.  Anytime you are installing third party software from different sources you may have problems upgrading or dist-upgrading in the future.  Its just not recomended if you want a better explaination please just search the forums.  Its been discussed to death.
[07:17] <Poseidon> but it is fine with me to do something with windows system

[07:18] <unfo> pc22, what software are you using?
[07:18] <iter> chuckyp: but I have added repos to get all the normal stuff working
[07:18] <Poseidon> why not use VM
[07:18] <unfo> Poseidon, VMs are slow.
[07:18] <khaije1> towsonu2003: do you ever attend the baltolug meetings, i wonder if we've met

[07:18] <iter> chuckyp: I still don't see the point, and saying that "it's been discussed to death" doesn't really help
[07:18] <towsonu2003> khaije1, no, I'm pretty much a "loner" :p
[07:19] <rawrness> autoers are evil
[07:19] <unfo> towsonu2003, it's good to get out sometimes :)
[07:19] <chuckyp> iter, I'm not going to get in a discussion of why it is bad.  I've told you.
[07:19] <towsonu2003> unfo, lol, but it's too bright outside...
[07:19] <iter> you've said some patently false stuff at least
[07:19] <chuckyp> iter, its not supported here.  Thats pretty much the final answer
[07:19] <chuckyp> iter, No i have not.
[07:19] <khaije1> towsonu2003: ya, unfo is right, I'll save yr nick so i can catch you later, i'm gonna get some rest
[07:20] <omac> iter what are you trying to do?  install the flash plugin for firefox?
[07:20] <chuckyp> omac, he's trolling
[07:20] <iter> no man I got everything working fine thank
[07:20] <iter> and I'm not trolling
[07:20] <azureal> sigh...reg sound was kinda messed up by installing and uninstalling =/
[07:20] <Poseidon> how much space  dose this ubuntu need
[07:20] <towsonu2003> khaije1, good night -I usually hang in the forums though :)
[07:20] <azureal> wrong chan.
[07:20] <iter> I just saw someone say devs hate automatix
[07:20] <pc22> unfo, express scribe
[07:20] <firebird619> I just started Ubuntu and it just gets through GRUB and then the screen goes black and stays that way, I don't get to the login screen. This has occured the past couple days off and on. What can I do to fix this issue?
[07:20] <jonkelle> actually, if iter wants to use automatix.... and 'possibly' (I say possibly, because I have repeatedly used it since early Breezy with no problem) why can't you just say we don't support automatix here?  and let it be at that?
[07:20] <chuckyp> Poseidon, depends on what you want to install?  Will this be a desktop setup?
[07:20] <iter> and I wanted to know if that were actually the case
[07:20] <unfo> pc22, where did you download it from?
[07:20] <towsonu2003> polttaja-, 10GB and you'll be happy, 5GB at least I guess
[07:20] <khaije1> oic, gdnight
[07:21] <chuckyp> iter, it is the case
[07:21] <iter> got a reference?
[07:21] <jonkelle> you can get all the support you need for automatix on their forums anyhow.
[07:21] <iter> I'd like to know why
[07:21] <pc22> http://www.nch.com.au/software/linux.html
[07:21] <chuckyp> !automatix | iter
[07:21] <ubotu> iter: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[07:21] <jerb_> automatix is like making homemade cardboard gaskets for your porsche
[07:21] <unfo> Poseidon, 3 GB minimum. But I think the installer will steal half your hard disk automatically unless you tell it not to.
[07:21] <towsonu2003> Poseidon, yea, be careful with the installer :)
[07:22] <Poseidon> god
[07:22] <towsonu2003> lol
[07:22] <unfo> how much disk space does the installer take automatically? is it 50%?
[07:22] <Poseidon> too much
[07:22] <unfo> Poseidon, you can reduce it easily.
[07:23] <Poseidon> ok i got it
[07:23] <jonkelle> so, anyhow iter just check out the automatix forums if you have any problems.  if you're smart enough to edit a /etc/apt/sources.list you can probably not worry too much about what it does.  Most of the 'non-free' stuff, it actually just does a wget on and for the most part, the sources.list is only slightly modified, with it marked clearly what automatix added.
[07:23] <unfo> rawrness, if you get no answer try http://www.vmware.com/community/index.jsp
[07:23] <pc22> unfo, actually i cant make it to work

[07:25] <unfo> omac, thank you for the tip but why did you PM? :-)
[07:25] <jonkelle> read what I typed, it doesn't say that.
[07:25] <jonkelle> I said if you're smart enough to do it, then automatix won't kill your day.
[07:25] <unfo> pc22, how much does automatic scribe cost?
[07:25] <towsonu2003> jonkelle, "if you're smart enough to edit a /etc/apt/sources.list you can probably not worry too much about what it does" but this is going to become a flamewar, I shut up :)
[07:25] <jonkelle> which I mean.  if you're smart enough.
[07:25] <Farnaby> Ahah! It took some mucking about but the ubuntu machine has graphics agaiN!
[07:25] <jonkelle> not if you're a newbie.
[07:26] <pc22> unfo, the one im using is free
[07:26] <iter> hehe I'm not afraid of editing a makefile or two
[07:26] <iter> just wondering the rationale behind the anti-automatix comment
[07:26] <eyequeue> also, automatix is highly UN-recommended in here, it breaks too many systems
[07:26] <jonkelle> if you're a newbie, you're probably just figuring out how to open the gui's right?

[07:26] <rawrness> auto scripts are evil
[07:27] <iter> and since he used to be a ubuntu dev...
[07:27] <iter> that must be where it came from
[07:27] <jonkelle> arnieboy authored the original automatix
[07:27] <rawrness> noobs like i was should learn how to set things up
[07:27] <unfo> omac, > "the default ubuntu install takes about 7-8 GB's." >> so it takes 5-6 GB for free ext3 space?
[07:27] <jonkelle> now it's more of a community effort.
[07:27] <Farnaby> and I think I discovered where the screensaver issue is. Anybody know where the option to lower colors is?
[07:28] <Poseidon> why dose it need so much space?
[07:28] <towsonu2003> Farnaby, I believe in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[07:28] <unfo> Poseidon, it does not. you can tell it to take only 2 or 3 GB.
[07:28] <iter> ah I see arnieboy had the beef with the ubuntu dev
[07:28] <Poseidon> oh
[07:28] <tzadikim> so...i appear to be too stupid to figure out how to fix a udev mounting root file systems bug in dapper, but it's apparently been addressed in the edgy release...should i try edgy, or is it gonna be too much for a complete newbie? do i wait for feisty?
[07:29] <jonkelle> and half the reason ubuntu is gaining steam is that it is newb friendly.  not all pc users want/need to know how it works under the sheets.
[07:29] <towsonu2003> tzadikim, what's the bug # ?

[07:33] <Juan> i have my dsl connection configured on pppoeconf, but it renews ip every 12 hours, will it reconnect automatically?
[07:33] <theDtTvB> Hello there, I am using Ubuntu Server, and I installed KDE.
[07:34] <theDtTvB> After that, KDE keeps prompting me to login, what should I do?
[07:34] <unfo> iter, there is no such thing as free speech on IRC. Congress guarantees you that right but Ubuntu does not. :)
[07:34] <chuckyp> theDtTvB, you log in as your user.
[07:34] <Poseidon> oh cool
[07:34] <theDtTvB> Yes.
[07:34] <Farnaby> well when i go to gnome-screensaver-preferences through command line I get the following: LibGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support cisual 0x4b | Gnome-screensaver-Message: Found best visual for GL: 0x25
[07:34] <chuckyp> Farnaby, what type of video card?
[07:34] <unfo> theDtTvB, why did you install Server?
[07:34] <nothlit> theDtTvB, you log in, or disable kdm depending on what you want to do
[07:35] <theDtTvB> I want to try it. I had Desktop already.
[07:35] <Farnaby> chuckyp: old.... matrox 400g. but its free and the ubuntu machine isn't currently my main machine
[07:35] <firebird619> What would cause Ubuntu to go throug GRUB, but then the screen goes blank and stays that way, never getting to the login screen?
[07:35] <chuckyp> Farnaby, well what is the response of glxinfo | grep render
[07:35] <chuckyp> firebird619, lots of things
[07:36] <unfo> theDtTvB, that's fair. so log in. :)
[07:36] <pc22> i need to use internet explorer and i got it using ie4linux but i cant use activex
[07:36] <jonkelle> I don't believe activex will work under wine
[07:36] <theDtTvB> The login screen shows up, I typed my username and password the screen turns black, and the login window pops up again and again.
[07:36] <chuckyp> firebird619, try hitting ctrl+alt+f1 and see if you get a text console.
[07:36] <towsonu2003> tzadikim, the fix won't go to Dapper, that's for sure... if you think you're gonna bump into that, I'd go with edgy. edgy is, well, edgy :) you can also install dapper and do what this comment says: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/6367/comments/83
[07:36] <unfo> pc22, how did you plug in the pedal? USB?
[07:36] <Farnaby> just that the 3d driver claims not to support 0x4b and then hangs chuckyp
[07:36] <theDtTvB> Looks like I missed to install something...
[07:37] <pc22> its still now working unfo
[07:37] <Poseidon> unfo ,which is your first Linux sys when you knew Linux,ubuntu?redhad?XGL or else
[07:37] <chuckyp> Farnaby, if you type in "glxinfo | grep render"   in a terminal?
[07:37] <unfo> pc22, USB?
[07:37] <firebird619> chuckyp: No, I don't. This has been an ongoing problem the past couple days, it will do this and then all of a sudden work again.
[07:37] <Juan> i have my dsl connection configured on pppoeconf, but it renews ip every 12 hours. will it reconnect automatically?
[07:37] <Farnaby> chuckyp yes
[07:37] <unfo> Poseidon, it was Mandrake. I hated it.
[07:37] <Farnaby> thats what Ityped and thats what i got
[07:37] <Poseidon> why
[07:37] <tzadikim> drat, this is gonna be the third live cd download in two days
[07:37] <chuckyp> firebird619, hrm... I would suspect some faulty hardware if its working some times then not others.
[07:37] <unfo> Poseidon, no apt-get
[07:37] <pc22> usb is working but not the pedal
[07:37] <towsonu2003> tzadikim, Dapper will be supported for 3 years (desktop) while edgy will get 1,5 years (I believe). Also, edgy is designed to be more buggy then dapper (that's how their plans started)
[07:38] <unfo> Poseidon, if you want to find out what apt-get is, type: /msg ubotu apt-get
[07:38] <Poseidon> apt-get?whar is that
[07:38] <chuckyp> Farnaby, hm....  I wouldn't even know where to begin with that card for drivers.
[07:38] <Poseidon> ok
[07:38] <Xzyx987X> has anyone had any luck getting eclipse to work in 64 bit builds of kubuntu
[07:38] <Farnaby> chuckyp: me neither sadly... damn old junk
[07:38] <firebird619> chuckyp: Which piece of hardware, the PC is about 4 years old and the HDD about 1-1 1/2 years old. Would this problem be graphics or what?
[07:38] <chuckyp> Farnaby, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1687814
[07:38] <iter> nah there's definitely a matrox driver
[07:38] <Xzyx987X> I installed it from the standard package, but when I try and run it it generates a huge error log
[07:38] <unfo> pc22, type: lsusb
[07:39] <tzadikim> towsonu, so what does that mean? if i'm totally new is edgy gonna be too difficult?
[07:39] <chuckyp> firebird619, well its hard to say when it does boot you could try to check out the logs and see what failed if anything on the last boot.  Do you have another os on the machine?
[07:39] <Xzyx987X> could someone just try and install it and see if they have the same problem?
[07:39] <unfo> pc22, that's spelled ell ess you ess bee :)
[07:39] <towsonu2003> tzadikim, no, it will probably be as easy as dapper. but you may encounter bugs here and there
[07:39] <Farnaby> chucky: thanks man, google had just pulled that up as well

[07:40] <Poseidon> what is your sys now unfo? dual-boot?
[07:40] <Madpilot> unfo, pastebin!
[07:40] <tzadikim> is it just as easy to set up a dual boot?
[07:40] <unfo> pc22, hmm. i wonder what that means
[07:40] <unfo> Madpilot, sorry
[07:40] <unfo> Poseidon, yes
[07:40] <chuckyp> firebird619, most of your log files will be in /var/log   in there you will find files such as dmesg etc..  that you can look at and see what went wrong last time. Xorg.0.old   etc....
[07:40] <towsonu2003> tzadikim, let me say it this way: if the system is of *utmost* importance to you, I'd go with dapper.
[07:40] <firebird619> chuckyp: yes, Windows XP, it is on a separate HDD that isn't connected when Linux is.
[07:40] <Poseidon> which and which one
[07:40] <chuckyp> firebird619, does xp boot every time?
[07:40] <firebird619> chuckyp: Yes.
[07:41] <chuckyp> firebird619, okay well then I would start leaning towards software.  Or possibly memory if anything.
[07:41] <iter> haha
[07:41] <chuckyp> firebird619, What about the live cd.
[07:41] <unfo> pc22, I would ask in #hardware
[07:41] <tzadikim> towsonu, yeah, mostly i'm just trying to learn a bit about linux, but i intend to hold on to my windows partition for now, so i guess utmost importance wouldn't be quite true :-)
[07:41] <pc22> thanks a million
[07:41] <towsonu2003> tzadikim, then I'd go with edgy :)
[07:42] <iter> ahh got it
[07:42] <iter> of course it was included
[07:42] <iter> driver is mga
[07:42] <unfo> pc22, tell them your full lsusb output. it is probably safe to paste 5 lines in #hardware.
[07:42] <iter> Farnaby: make sure you're using mga in xorg.conf
[07:42] <Poseidon> i want to setup a Linux XGL   does it work
[07:42] <tzadikim> ok, thank you very much, i'll give it a shot

[07:43] <Xzyx987X> here is the full log of the eclipse problem: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29683/plain/

[07:44] <iter> Farnaby: http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg28133.html
[07:44] <chuckyp> Farnaby, are you using 6.10
[07:44] <ndowens> gah, my screen won't quit moving/flickering or whatever u can see the screen kinda shake
[07:44] <unfo> ndowens, when did the problem start?
[07:44] <Farnaby> chuckyp: yes, updated to get gnomepilot working
[07:45] <iter> fortunately it's cosmetic only
[07:45] <Farnaby> iter: so it seems, they released edgy with a few issues...
[07:45] <chuckyp> Farnaby, did you check out the link i sent you earlier for a possible solution?
[07:45] <iter> well that's a mesa issue
[07:45] <omac> appen:  neither.   Edgy Eft is the best version I have had the pleasure to use and install stuff for and saw no need to use other installers.  Besides I am betting more resources have been thrown at ubuntu to make it easy to boot and install free open-source stuff.   The only thing that could make the install faster is by doing something like mirrors but each mirror could be like a torrent seed for every file in the ubuntu multi-verse.  The downl
[07:45] <omac> oad bandwidth right now is adequate, but torrent-like mirrors could make the download-bandwidth better.
[07:45] <unfo> pc22, did it work?
[07:45] <firebird619> chuckyp: It boots to Live just fine.
[07:45] <Farnaby> chuckyp: trying it now, about to restart
[07:45] <ndowens> unfo: it's been like this for a while, it's worse if the refresh rate is high
[07:45] <chuckyp> firebird619, hrm.. are you re detecting the drive in the bios when you switch and unplug the other?
[07:46] <tzadikim> hey, one more question...if i have a 64bit processor do i want to go for the 64 bit edgy?
[07:46] <unfo> ndowens, does the problem happen only in ubuntu, or other OSes too?
[07:46] <chuckyp> Farnaby, you should be able to just restart x.  ctrl+alt+backspace
[07:46] <eyequeue> tzadikim, no
[07:46] <unfo> tzadikim, I recommend the 32 bit. it's better tested.
[07:46] <ndowens> all, i am in gentoo atm, but i ordered a ubuntu cd so i am just hanging here, and wondering why that is too
[07:46] <pc22> unfo, still asking
[07:46] <chuckyp> tzadikim, you can try either or.
[07:46] <firebird619> chuckyp: BIOS detects it. I don't switch hardly at all though.  I prefer Linux over Windows.
[07:46] <ndowens> only guesses are either monitor or vid card, not sure which
[07:46] <dorto> anyone knows if Crafty(chess engine) is available in any repository that can be used in Ubuntu?
[07:47] <Farnaby> chuckyp: i am going for a fullrestart anyway since my last one was sorta messy between all the xorg modifications I was pulling to get it working correctly
[07:47] <unfo> ndowens, does it happen in DOS? Windows? in the BIOS setup screen?
[07:47] <eyequeue> !info crafty
[07:47] <ubotu> Package crafty does not exist in any distro I know
[07:47] <omac> tzadikim: yes, but do keep the 32 bit 386 kernel in your grub menu.  don't uninstall the 32-bit 386 vanilla kernel.
[07:47] <unfo> ndowens, you can get old vid cards cheap on ebay or free at www.freecycle.org
[07:47] <ndowens> i think it does it after the screen being on a while and haven't noticed it doin it in the bios setup
[07:47] <chuckyp> firebird619, hrm...  I would run an fsck on the drive make sure that tests okay.  Also run a memtest make sure that works.  If all else fails possibly try reinstalling thats just wierd.  Its very difficult to trouble shoot intermitent problems.
[07:47] <unfo> !freecycle | ndowens
[07:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about freecycle - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:47] <iter> dorto: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31659
[07:47] <Farnaby> however, I will say that minus this graphics issue and minus the fact that quark has lost mp3 support/totem losing avi support, edgy is great
[07:48] <tzadikim> omac, theres nothing to uninstall, im doing a fresh linux install, hoping to dual boot with xp
[07:48] <Farnaby> the quark/totem issue seems to be just me though
[07:48] <tzadikim> do i want to test out the 32 first?
[07:48] <firebird619> chuckyp: I just did clean install of Edgy 2 days ago
[07:48] <chuckyp> tzadikim, what type of processor do you have?
[07:48] <unfo> Poseidon, do you have a Chinese IME installed? does it work in Chatzilla?
[07:48] <chuckyp> firebird619, was it working fine from the start or did this problem always occur?
[07:49] <tzadikim> dualcore amd 64 x2
[07:49] <Poseidon> IME what is it
[07:49] <unfo> Poseidon, can you type on your computer in chinese?
[07:49] <tzadikim> it sounds like everyone has a different opinion :-)
[07:49] <diesel> Does ndiswrapper come in the stock Ubuntu kernel (specifically Edgy's kernel)?
[07:49] <chuckyp> tzadikim, then you can get away with installing the amd64 package.  Or the 32bit it doesn't really matter the choice is yours.  Perhaps search the forums for some issues people have had.
[07:49] <Poseidon> of course
[07:50] <Poseidon> 
[07:50] <Poseidon> 
[07:50] <tzadikim> ok, thank you
[07:50] <totall_6_7> lol
[07:50] <chuckyp> tzadikim, if i'm not mistakent though I believe you can now run 32bit apps on 64bit system with 6.10

[07:51] <tzadikim> oh yeah i think i'll want flash
[07:51] <firebird619> chuckyp: I had been having this problem after having Dapper installed and updating to Edgy, thats why I did the clean install to try and solve the problem, that didn't work. The problem still occured after the clean install.
[07:52] <chuckyp> firebird619, hrm.. perhaps try installing dapper and see if the problem persists.  If it does then you know a its a problem with a package in edgy.
[07:52] <Poseidon> lol  there is no one there
[07:52] <chuckyp> firebird619, which may be the case from what you are saying.
[07:52] <unfo> Poseidon, in #ubuntu-tw there are ppl there.
[07:52] <dooglus> ubuntu is based on debian.  you shouldn't need to do a clean install - you can apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade from one release to the next
[07:52] <dorto> iter, i too got a few google hits to ubuntuforums threads, but none of them are loading. is ubuntuforums.org down today?
[07:52] <chuckyp> firebird619, that should be if it doesn't
[07:52] <chuckyp> dorto, they are up.
[07:52] <iter> dorto: works here, try google cash
[07:52] <iter> err cache
[07:53] <BHSPitLappy> google checkout
[07:53] <dorto> ok
[07:53] <unfo> dorto, dunno. try the ubuntu mailing lists or google cache or http://web.archive.org instead.
[07:53] <chuckyp> firebird619, what type of system do you have?
[07:53] <firebird619> chuckyp: Yes, I could try that. Could it possibly be a driver issue, every time I start Ubuntu, when it does work, just past GRUB it shows a black screen with multiple colored dots and lines, sometimes thick white lines, multicolored lines, etc.
[07:53] <Farnaby> chuckyp, your fix worked and for that I am thankful
[07:53] <chuckyp> Farnaby, np
[07:53] <firebird619> chuckyp: I have an eMachines Desktop. 2 Ghz, Intel Built-in graphics, 256 MB Ram.
[07:54] <chuckyp> firebird619, hrm... maybe search for your model ont he forums.  Other than that I would try dapper just to make sure its a driver issue with edgy.  Most likely going to be a problem with video drivers or the kernel.
[07:55] <chuckyp> firebird619, the other thing to try would be booting with out X and see how often the system fails that way.
[07:55] <chuckyp> firebird619, then you would know if tis a video or kernel issue.
[07:56] <firebird619> chuckyp: Ok, I can try dapper again, all I really had installed extra was Beryl (which is amazing). How do I tell it to boot without X?
[07:56] <unfo> ubotu, freecycle is a set of mailing lists where you can give away things (including old hardware) for free or get things for free. get more info at freecycle.org.
[07:56] <unfo> ubotu, freecycle.org is a set of mailing lists where you can give away things (including old hardware) for free or get things for free. get more info at freecycle.org.
[07:56] <chuckyp> firebird619, yeah I would do that before try dapper
[07:57] <firebird619> chuckyp: How do I tell it to not start X? I can't get to anything really except the GRUB menu.
[07:58] <chuckyp> firebird619, okay type in runlevel to see which runlevel you are running now
[07:59] <firebird619> chuckyp: Where do I type that in, at the GRUB menu?
[07:59] <espenel> confidential
[07:59] <chuckyp> firebird619, terminal
[07:59] <towsonu2003> ?
[07:59] <chuckyp> firebird619, you can try appending init 2 to the end of the kernel line
[08:00] <iter> sheesh wouldn't it be easier to boot to single user
[08:00] <unfo> chuckyp, or: single
[08:00] <iter> linux single at grub menu
=== rob1 is now known as rob
[08:00] <firebird619> chuckyp: All I can get to is the GRUB menu, how do I get to a terminal from there. Then I can append init 2 to the kernel line.
[08:00] <chuckyp> firebird619, yeah just append single to the end of the line
[08:00] <chuckyp> unfo, ty
[08:01] <unfo> chuckyp, np
[08:01] <Farnaby> well, xinelibs is still screwy, but thats an issue for manana, I gotta go get 5 hours of sleep so i can make it to work tomorrow
[08:01] <chuckyp> firebird619, do you have recovery mode as an option?
[08:01] <Farnaby> thanks again chucky
[08:01] <nothlit> firebird619, you can append it from the grub menu .. just hit e (for edit)
[08:01] <chuckyp> Farnaby, np
[08:01] <firebird619> chuckyp: Yes, I have recovery mode as an option.
[08:01] <firebird619> chuckyp: Should I go to that before appending single to the kernel line.
[08:02] <zircx> man, I don't know what the hell is going on but sites just don't seem to be coming up or resolving in the manner that they should be..
[08:02] <chuckyp> firebird619, well you can boot to recovery mode  or hit e i believe to add stuff to the end of what ever line your are currently selecting.  Then just add single at the end of the line.   Recovery mode automatically boots to single user mode so X will not start.
[08:02] <unfo> firebird619, just use recovery mode.
[08:02] <chuckyp> firebird619, if you append single to your nomral kernel line it will only be for that boot and upon restart you would have to do it again.
[08:02] <zircx> I've even gone to the extent of using opendns servers and still having problems with sites not resolving... I'm thinking that maybe it's my router now.. because I intially thought it was my ubuntu edgy
[08:03] <CuriousCat> does anyone here use ipw3945 working on edgy?
[08:03] <CuriousCat> i can't seem to get the daemon going
[08:03] <chuckyp> firebird619, if you just select recovery you could do it every time.
[08:04] <firebird619> chuckyp: So should I boot to recovery mode from now on for a while and see how often it crashes?
[08:04] <knapper> Guys, I am having a terrible time trying to get NVIDIA drivers installed properly.
[08:04] <chuckyp> firebird619, just select recovery mode.  Let it boot.  log in.  then sudo shutdown -r now   and do the same over again a few times.   And see if it hangs or crashes.
[08:04] <zircx> i click on a link which directs me to one site and a totally different site comes up, e.g i click on a forum link and i get www.imageshack.us coming up instead but it still fails to connect?
[08:04] <zircx> has anyone had a problem like this before..
[08:04] <Kawaii-Panda> the forums are down today isn't it?
[08:04] <chuckyp> firebird619, yeah thats the idea.  Then we will know if its a problem with X or some sort of driver issue.
[08:04] <varsendaggar> knapper,  go to the ubuntulinux.com   web site,   then click on the wiki and search for nvidia
[08:05] <firebird619> chuckyp: I didn't have to log in, it automatically logged in as root.
[08:05] <spanglesontoast> erm does anyone know why fglrx doesn't seem to work on edgy properly ?
[08:05] <chuckyp> zircx, DNS issues
=== preaction_ is now known as preaction
[08:05] <unfo> spanglesontoast, it is working badly for you? please elaborate.
[08:05] <chuckyp> firebird619, okay just shutdown -r now
[08:05] <unfo> !smart questions
[08:05] <chuckyp> firebird619, and try again make sure you can do it a few times.
[08:05] <zircx> chuckyp, I thought as much.. but I've got my router using opendns.. wouldn't that help resolve the dns problem, or would it relate more to my isp dns ?
[08:06] <unfo> all: should I put the smart-questions link into ubotu?
[08:06] <spanglesontoast> well it doesn't seem to enable 3d accell
[08:06] <firebird619> chuckyp: Ok, will do and see wat happens.
[08:06] <firebird619> *what
[08:06] <knapper> varsendagger, I am getting a version mismatch error. API mismatch.
[08:06] <knapper> I cannot install the nvidia drivers or nvidia-glx, neither work
[08:06] <knapper> when I change nv to nvidia
[08:06] <spanglesontoast> I'm just wondering if this is because I was using the k7 kernel now using the latest one provided with edgy
[08:07] <iter> knapper: gotta have appropriate restricted-modules as well'
[08:07] <knapper> iter I do
[08:07] <iter> so xserver dies?
[08:07] <zircx> knapper, are you using synaptic to install the nvidia drivers?
[08:08] <knapper> I tried synaptic and the nvidia installer
[08:08] <spanglesontoast> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0". ?
[08:08] <chuckyp> zircx, you could ifconfig and see who's dns you are using
[08:08] <knapper> I can install it fine, but when I try to use it, that is when it doesn't work
[08:08] <firebird619> chuckyp: restarted three times to recovery mode and so far so good. No problems.
[08:08] <iter> since when does ifconfig return dns
[08:08] <knapper> when I edit xorg.conf and change nv to nvidia
[08:08] <knapper> startx
[08:08] <chuckyp> zircx, i'm not really good at fixing dns issues
[08:08] <knapper> I get something about API mismatch
[08:09] <chuckyp> zircx, perhaps someone else may know more.
[08:09] <knapper> kernel and the module are from different drivers
[08:09] <yakumo> how do i play .mkv format? im using mplayer
[08:09] <chuckyp> firebird619, What type of video card do you have?
=== Cre[a] tiveEmb[a]  is now known as CreativeEmbassy
[08:09] <zircx> chuckyp, the eth0 is configured as a static that uses the router as a gateway
[08:09] <towsonu2003> knapper, I guess you installed the nvidia drivers from nvidia site?
[08:09] <firebird619> chuckyp: Intel Built-in i810.
[08:09] <chuckyp> zircx, yeah I can't remember how to show which dns servers you are using.
[08:10] <zircx> the router is configured to use opendns servers.. somethings not right though.. weirdly  enough..
[08:10] <knapper> towsonu2003 at one point I have
[08:10] <chuckyp> firebird619, okay try booting to recovery mode and editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf and changing your video driver to vesa
[08:10] <zircx> oh hang on ..
[08:10] <iter> zircx: you have the problem in firefox and not mozilla, right?
[08:10] <iter> zircx: if so it's not a dns issue
[08:10] <iter> unless you got some crazy hosts files
[08:10] <azureal> hi, sudo modprobe intel8x0 just freezes
[08:10] <zircx> iter, I had the problem in firefox, I haven't used mozilla  but I did earlier on and it was doing the same..
[08:11] <zircx> iter, is there a problem with firefox?
[08:11] <iter> zircx: no
[08:11] <firebird619> chuckyp: do I change the line that says Driver        "i810" to vesa?
[08:11] <firebird619> to read Driver     "vesa"
[08:11] <towsonu2003> knapper, you'll have to reinstall it
[08:11] <towsonu2003> knapper, I believe
[08:11] <zircx> I actually did a fresh install because i had issues with xserver..(long story) also..
[08:11] <zircx> so it's a fresh install

[08:12] <knapper> towsonu2003 I have tried, it fails
[08:12] <iter> zircx: you have a router right
[08:12] <knapper> towsonu2003 It say it cannot compile a kernel or something to that effect
[08:12] <iter> zircx: does it get ip via dhcp ?
[08:12] <towsonu2003> knapper, maybe it cannot find the kernel headers?
[08:12] <KenSentMe> How can i see the list of users currently in a channel in irssi?
[08:12] <zircx> no, I've changed it to static, but yes it can do dhcp
[08:12] <iter> KenSentMe: /who
[08:12] <chuckyp> firebird619, yes
[08:13] <towsonu2003> knapper, this command: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[08:13] <iter> zircx: that's fine, as long as you know the dns is correct for your isp
[08:13] <KenSentMe> iter: thanks
[08:13] <firebird619> chuckyp: Ok, after that is edited do I try booting normally?
[08:13] <towsonu2003> knapper, that should install everything you need. then try reinstalling again
[08:13] <iter> zircx: setup dns server in router
[08:13] <knapper> build-essential is already the newest version
[08:13] <iter> zircx: then point /etc/resolv.conf to router ip
[08:13] <knapper> :/
[08:13] <chuckyp> firebird619, well you can try startx
[08:13] <chuckyp> firebird619, see if it atleast loads x
[08:13] <firebird619> chuckyp: Ok
[08:14] <towsonu2003> knapper, kernel headers? what was that package's name?
[08:14] <zircx> well the eth0 on this machine is setup as a static ip with the router as the gateway.. the router is setup to use the dns of the isp

[08:17] <knapper> done
[08:17] <towsonu2003> knapper, ok, what's the output of ls -l /usr/src/linux

[08:23] <firebird619> chuckyp: I didn't install any specific driver. It is what installed with Edgy. I take back that it booted normally, soon after I logged in, it took me to a blank screen, and when I type it shows weird symbols.
[08:23] <Adriano> rufi: in nautilus, enable "show hidden files"

[08:24] <chuckyp> firebird619, I would try windows and see if you are experiencing artifacts in your video.
[08:24] <iter> smoenux: portforward.com
[08:24] <chuckyp> firebird619, if that is the case that is a tell tale sign of bad video card memory.

[08:25] <pc22> anyone using ies4linux now?

[08:28] <unfo> thee3, try looking for VCD in Applications menu > Add/Remove
[08:28] <tortho> iter: thanks a lot!!
[08:28] <rufi> Adriano: well I could format/scandisk it on windows but it will have to wait until evening... Currently there's only linux here :). Any tips?

[08:28] <unfo> nothlit, i have no clue. ask again here or try channel #gnome :)
[08:29] <cyphase> :P
[08:29] <nothlit> unfo, ahh kk ty
[08:29] <unfo> w4zz, i dunno. maybe google "Ergo Group"?
[08:29] <firebird619> chuckyp: Ok, I can try uninstalling Beryl :-(. Should I still enter that command you gave me thought.
[08:29] <firebird619> *though
[08:29] <Adriano> rufi: I meant, check if the problem still exists on other computers - operating systems
[08:29] <w4zz> okey.. i try a little more... thnx for the try unfo :)
[08:29] <zircx> urhm, i guess you can't override the server dns even if you're using opendns due to backward compatibility
[08:30] <Adriano> rufi: before reformatting, to rule out a bug
[08:30] <chuckyp> firebird619, well remove beryl first and see how the system acts.  IF its acting screwey come back here.
[08:30] <iter> zircx: how's that ?
[08:30] <zircx> buggy beta nvidia drivers and beryl!
[08:30] <firebird619> chuckyp: Is that sudo apt-get uninstall beryl-manager?
[08:30] <kleinlappies> hello
[08:30] <towsonu2003> knapper, sorry, I won't be able to help with that one. I dunno what "initialization from incompatible pointer type" means while reinstalling the nvidia driver... For anyone who have an idea: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29685/
[08:30] <zircx> not much better iter
[08:30] <zircx> I believe it is a isp dns issue..
[08:30] <kleinlappies> can anyone tell me if there is a good backup program for thunderbird.

[08:31] <iter> zircx: your isp's dns is probably working fine
[08:31] <ndowens> but dunno what it means, it is some compile error than dns

[08:32] <ndowens> zircx: try ping yahoo.com if it says it can't resolv it then most likely it is a dns issue

[08:33] <LainNaomi> anyone knows about Plan 9 from bell lab?
[08:33] <chuckyp> firebird619, try the vesa driver  that should work.  Then you could edit the file and try using the i810 driver and see how it acts.
[08:33] <zircx> firebird619, what video card are you using?
[08:33] <Adriano> SizzlerWA: you should search some project that interests you

[08:34] <brocoli> i install ubuntu 6.10 and don't have a console. how i can install it?
[08:34] <Adriano> LainNaomi: I do know a bit about Plan9, I installed it here
[08:34] <Adriano> what's the issue?
[08:34] <diesel> Edgy Eft has been a big disappointment
[08:34] <LainNaomi> I can't get my usb mouse working:p
[08:34] <iter> zircx: next thing to try is put your isp dns in /etc/resolv.conf in place of router dns
[08:34] <firebird619> zircx: Gee, thanks. : - ). The system is about 4 years old.
[08:34] <Adriano> diesel: http://theinside-out.blogspot.com/2006/10/en-its-called-edgy-for-reason.html
[08:35] <tortho> diesel: yupp..... what's new in it?... :-(
[08:35] <zircx> sorry man, I could help ya if you had nvidia card..
[08:35] <Adriano> LainNaomi: and it surprises you?
[08:35] <diesel> tortho: all the crap that doesn't work, is new
[08:35] <zircx> I installed it beryl / emerald  / nvidia / kiba-dock the other day.
[08:35] <tortho> diesel:  yupp as i was about to write: except for more problems with hardware
[08:35] <LainNaomi> no not really I really know little about it
[08:35] <zircx> ok
[08:36] <zircx> iter, , the primary dns or both or all?
[08:36] <Adriano> LainNaomi: it's a research project, lots of good ideas, not the best implementation
[08:36] <brocoli> how i can use pppoeconf without console?
[08:36] <diesel> Anyone have success modprobe'ing ndiswrapper?
[08:36] <firebird619> zircx: thats fine, I know it is old. I have another system, Dell 3.2 Ghz with Nvidia FX5200, but need Windows on that for now for college work, etc. I've always had bad luck with Dual boot, thats why I use separate HDDs for everything.
[08:36] <tortho> anyone got bluetooth working in gnome? what did you set up to make it work?
[08:36] <Adriano> for that, you could try Inferno, but It Is Not Ubuntu (TM)
[08:36] <Regurgitator> does anyone know how i could solve this as i would really like to try out ubuntu but these display limitations are preventing me
[08:36] <iter> zircx: for testing remove the secondary (comment it out)
[08:37] <thee3> unfo: still there?
[08:37] <iter> zircx: change primary dns to isp dns
[08:37] <zircx> k
[08:37] <pradeep> can i execute commands on a remote machine through a shell script?
[08:37] <iter> pradeep: yes, through ssh
[08:37] <mseve> !samba
[08:37] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[08:37] <LainNaomi> Yeah I haven't figure out what's special about it and I'm reading the manual at present
[08:37] <Firefishe> Hello..first time here.  Does ubuntu support xen?
[08:38] <iter> yes
[08:38] <KenSentMe> !xen | Firefishe
[08:38] <ubotu> Firefishe: XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy
[08:38] <zircx> nameserver dns.server.ip.address ? yeah
[08:38] <iter> zircx: yes
[08:38] <rufi> Adriano: ok, I'll do it and if there is indeed a bug, i'll report it
[08:38] <zircx> ok done
[08:38] <pradeep> iter, can i directly place the commands in the script?
[08:38] <iter> please do 'dig google.com'
[08:38] <firebird619> How do I uninstall a package from a terminal, is it sudo apt-get uninstall packagename?
[08:38] <zircx> firebird619, bummer, i don't use windows at all these days..
[08:38] <Adriano> rufi: good. remember to check if it hasn't been reported before
[08:39] <KenSentMe> firebird619: sudo apt-get remove package
[08:39] <Firefishe> one more q.  pbly the most important:  where can I get 1.  a current dvd release of Dapper and 2.  a supplemental cd/dvd of the edgy upgrade?
[08:39] <firebird619> zircx: believe me, I wouldn't either if I didn't have college work that required Windows.
[08:39] <zircx> I'm trying to get comfortable with ubuntu as a desktop
[08:39] <firebird619> KenSentMe: Thanks
[08:39] <tortho> firebird619: isnt it remove?
[08:39] <ndowens> why is it a issue that u aren't suppose to apt debian pckages in ubuntu
[08:39] <iter> pradeep: http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_network/x-087-2-appl.remote.html
[08:39] <iter> firebird619: apt-get remove package
[08:39] <firebird619> iter: Thank You.
[08:40] <brocoli> i dont have console in edgy
[08:40] <pradeep> ter, thanks a ton ! :)
[08:40] <zircx> oh you can get Xen on Edgy?
[08:40] <Adriano> Firefishe: that's a) 2 questions, b) I don't know c) neither d) why would you need one? there's been no updates yet
[08:40] <iter> np ssh rules
[08:40] <zircx> has anyone used it successfully and how good is it?
[08:40] <pradeep> :)
[08:40] <KenSentMe> Firefishe: check http://www.ubuntu.com/download. There should be a dvd download and an Edgy cd
[08:40] <iter> xen is cool but vmware is still the gold standard
[08:40] <firebird619> chuckyp: I uninstalled beryl now, am restarting and will see what happens.
[08:41] <KenSentMe> Firefishe: there's no update cd for upgrading from dapper to edgy
[08:41] <zircx> erm, they were saying that xen out did vmware benchmark wise
[08:41] <KenSentMe> !upgrade | Firefishe
[08:41] <ubotu> Firefishe: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
=== CreativeEmbassy is now known as Cre[a] tiveEmb[a] 
[08:41] <iter> zircx: yeah but mgmt wise esx server is waaay better than xen
[08:41] <iter> atm
[08:41] <dooglus> nothlit: the difference between 'free' and 'available' in gnome-system-monitor is that 'free' is what's available to the superuser, and 'available' is what's available to regular users.
[08:42] <zircx> iter, i take it those changes happen immediately on resolv.conf
[08:42] <dooglus> nothlit: some filesystems keep some percentage (10%?) of the disk reserved just for root to use
[08:42] <iter> yes
[08:42] <zircx> iter, yeah but you have to pay for that don't you.
[08:42] <iter> ooooohhhh yeah
[08:42] <iter> lots of $
[08:42] <vik> I've just tried moving up to flash 9 beta, but about:plugins in firefox still says I have version 7 installed. I put libplashplayer.so in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[08:42] <Adriano> KenSentMe: there's no dvd link either at canonical's servers or at the Uni Utah servers
[08:42] <daywalker> g'day! I  installed dapper, had no internt - so I got edgy - still no internet....but a win pc works off that same adsl modem? What gives?
[08:42] <iter> zircx: same issue?
[08:43] <iter> zircx: please issue 'dig google.com'
[08:43] <zircx> so far it's pretty good
[08:43] <Adriano> I guess that means a "there ain't no dvd for Edgy out yet"
[08:43] <fnf> vik: Not everyone has root permission, it's more natural to put it under your .mozilla/plugins/
[08:43] <KenSentMe> Adriano: i believed there where torrents of the dvd release
[08:43] <nothlit> dooglus, how do i fix it? its an old gentoo partition
[08:43] <zircx> much better :)
[08:43] <dooglus> nothlit: fix what?
[08:43] <KenSentMe> Adriano: maybe there won't be any dvd's for edgy
[08:43] <zircx> got a full print out that time..
[08:43] <Adriano> meh
[08:43] <nothlit> dooglus, how do i unreserve that space
[08:43] <daywalker> g'day! I  installed dapper, had no internet - so I got edgy - still no internet....but a win pc works off that same adsl modem? What gives?
[08:43] <Adriano> I did try a search
[08:43] <zircx> iter, thanks..
[08:43] <vik> fnf: that's where is was before, and should work from there for all users, no?
[08:43] <fnf> vik: And make sure the flash 7 plugin is uninstalled, this sometimes cause problem.
[08:44] <zircx> lets hope that holds up..
[08:44] <iter> yep glad you're working
[08:44] <vik> fnf: yeah did that
[08:44] <dooglus> nothlit: what filesystem is it?  (run "mount" to find out)
[08:44] <nothlit> ext3
[08:44] <zircx> now I've got to add all my bling back on
[08:44] <fnf> vik: Yes, but if you're the only user in the system, it makes more sense to put it in your home folder.
[08:44] <zircx> edgy edgy edgy
[08:44] <daywalker> also i can ping web addresses fine
[08:44] <vik> fnf: not the only user
[08:44] <koresko> Just got an old iMac and want to install xubuntu Edgy.  The machine boots the CD but the installer crashes.
[08:44] <Ademan> where does apt keep downloaded but not installed packages?
[08:44] <Adriano> is anyone else experiencing Epiphany crashing when you close it and Gmail is the last page on it? for me, Bug-buddy is always called
[08:45] <iter> wrote this humdinger with a dislocated bling finger
[08:45] <Ademan> koresko: try the alternate install?
[08:45] <nothlit> dooglus, does ubuntu behave this way as well? even if root and home are on different partitions?
[08:45] <daywalker> where can i look if my internet connection isint working in edgy?
[08:45] <fnf> vik: If you insist, try putting it in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/, this is not guaranteed to work though.
[08:45] <iter> Ademan: /var/cache/apt ?
[08:45] <koresko> Ademan: I'm downloading the alternate CD now, but it's got most of another hour to go.  Any idea if there's a way to start the textmode installer from the console with the regular CD?
[08:45] <coz_> daywalker, sustem administrator net work or
[08:45] <Ademan> daywalker: what do you mean not working?
[08:45] <coz_> ifconfig in the terminal
[08:46] <coz_> daywalker, or ifconfig in the terminal or iwsonfig if it is wireless
[08:46] <mygod> where dir... change  deb source  from ubuntu
[08:46] <daywalker> i cant browse, wont open a web page
[08:46] <coz_> daywalker, iwconfig
[08:46] <fnf> vik: The difference is that we never know what the binary flash 7 package did to our system without a monitor.
[08:46] <coz_> daywalker, are you on that machine now?
[08:46] <Ademan> koresko: if there was you would probably want to ctrl+alt+f1 into a virtual terminal, maybe there's a script somewhere, browse the install cd's file system maybe there is an installer
[08:46] <daywalker> no im on another machine
[08:47] <dooglus> nothlit: ext3 reserves 5% of the partition for root's use.  apparently it's changable when you format the fs, but I don't know.  I use reiserfs personally, which doesn't reserve and space for root.
[08:47] <dooglus> nothlit: see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=215177
[08:47] <firebird619> I just uninstalled Beryl, yet when Ubuntu Starts and I log in, Beryl starts, it goes to a black screen that is running fschk and then brings me back to Ubuntu login screen. What can I do?
[08:47] <iter> stabbyfs
[08:47] <zircx> i take it wiki.ubuntu is down...
[08:47] <coz_> daywalker, ok did you ifconfig or iwconfig in the terminal to see if you are connected
[08:47] <vik> fnf: huh? the install script is quite simple.
[08:47] <Regurgitator> is there something i can do to stabilize the screen with my ati card so that i can install ubuntu? i tried both 640X480 and 800X600 resolutions which are resolutions i already know worked on windows
[08:47] <koresko> Ademan: Thanks.  I did ctrl-alt-f1 and have a console.  Killed X so I have a bit of ram free.  Just need to find the textmode installer, if there is one on the CD...
[08:48] <daywalker> no that machine is at another location Im home now reading up on it to fix tomorrow
[08:48] <mygod> who can give me a source for install xchm
[08:48] <KenSentMe> koresko: i don think there is a text mode installer on the regular cd
[08:48] <iter> I like filesystems
[08:48] <iter> stuff like xfs is cool
[08:48] <Ademan> koresko: yeah i dunno if there's one
[08:48] <coz_> daywalker,i see
[08:48] <iter> but as far as putting data I care about on em ...
[08:48] <Ademan> xfs doesnt like GRUB though :-(
[08:48] <daywalker> coz, the same thing happened with dapper
[08:49] <ndowens> i am not having a problem
[08:49] <fnf> vik: Ahh, I forgot there's a downloadable package, of course. You may put it under /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/ to see if it works, I'd recommend to work within your home though.
[08:49] <daywalker> thats the reason i got edgy
[08:49] <Madpilot> zircx, seems like it's more than just the wiki; I can't get to www.ubuntu.com or planet.ubuntu.com either
[08:49] <daywalker> if i connect another pc on it, winxp it works
[08:49] <KenSentMe> mygod: xchm is in the repo's
[08:49] <KenSentMe> !info xchm
[08:49] <ubotu> xchm: Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file viewer for X. In component universe, is optional. Version 2:1.9-3 (edgy), package size 237 kB, installed size 944 kB
[08:49] <coz_> daywalker, mmm that is odd, what is your machine, specs... cpu, memory,, manufacutere, home built???
[08:49] <koresko> Bummer - hate to have to download all over again to get the text installer.  But it's probably easier than installing without one ;)
[08:49] <dooglus> nothlit: see "man mkfs.ext3" - specifically the -m flag.
[08:49] <zircx> Madpilot, erm bummer, well at least it wasn't my dns issue..
[08:50] <ndowens> Ademan: i am not having a problem with XFS+grub
[08:50] <vik> fnf: put it in home as well, but now about:plugins shows both 9 and 7 installed. I can't work out where version 7 is coming from. Is there a search path for firefox plugins somwhere/
[08:50] <Ademan> ndowens: maybe they fixed it i dunno
[08:50] <Madpilot> zircx, not unless my roommate's flaky router has also flaked out again :|
[08:50] <fnf> vik: What did you install flash 7 with ?.
[08:50] <brocoli> how i can configure pppoe without console?
[08:50] <daywalker> quite old, 256MB ram, pentium 3 733 i think, change network cards in it too just incase
[08:50] <ndowens> it had a problem with the older i forget what version where it didn't/couldn't understand it, but it has been fixed
[08:51] <nothlit> dooglus, i followed that link you gave me and fixed it... thanks a lot! :D
[08:51] <dooglus> nothlit: see also "man tune2fs" - the -m flag again.  I don't know how compatible tune2fs is with ext3 filesystems though.  someone else here might know.
[08:51] <vik> fnf: flashplugin-nonfree package. But have uninstalled that now. AFAIK it just downloads the plugin, extracts it into the plugins directory
[08:51] <daywalker> coz, so u reckon ifconfig?im not on a wireless connection
[08:51] <nothlit> dooglus, yeah i used tune2fs and it worked
[08:51] <dooglus> nothlit: ok
[08:52] <koresko> nonthlit: tune2fs is the standard tool for manipulating ext3.  You just have to make sure you have a relatively modern version.
[08:52] <coz_> daywalker, well it should work but no way for me to know unless i ws there acutally.. I have several old machines i have installed edgy on on is an AMD k7 with 256 megs mem it works fine so off hand... I couldn't tell what theproblem is unless you were able to be at the machine whiles you are in here as well
[08:52] <nothlit> dooglus, the man page for tune2fs says its for both ext2 and ext3
[08:52] <poquedoraqu> Well, i need to quit tampering with linux without researching first
[08:52] <koresko> I used tune2fs to turn on data journaling, for example.
[08:52] <fnf> vik: is 'ls -la /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox' shows that a symlink ?
[08:52] <fnf> vik: to /usr/lib/firefox ?
[08:52] <Firefishe> Where can I get a list of the compiled kernel modules for 6.10 or Edgy?
[08:52] <coz_> daywalker, BUT there are many people musch moreknowledgeable that myself I amsure someone could help
[08:52] <dooglus> nothlit: your question took a lot of answering!  I had to download the source to gnome-system-monitor, and the source of one of the libs it uses to work out what the columns meant...  the documentation is crap, isn't it?
[08:53] <thyko> how do i install postscript printer drivers?
[08:53] <vik> fnf: yep
[08:53] <nothlit> dooglus, wow, thanks a lot a lot a lot then
[08:53] <ndowens> trying to decide with programming language i should learn
[08:53] <KenSentMe> Firefishe: use apt-cache search <word> or http://packages.ubuntu.com to search packages
[08:53] <daywalker> coz, tru, thanks anyhow.I'll be able to work from it in anotehr hour or so - ill see how i get on till - thanks
[08:53] <dooglus> nothlit: I was interested to find out what the columns meant for myself.  they are identical on my system, and I've wondered before why they were both shown.
[08:54] <nothlit> dooglus, yes its frustrating the yelp documentation and the man documentation never define all the columns/settings/variables
[08:54] <ndowens> !programming
[08:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about programming - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:54] <eilker> hi, i installed apache2 and php5, now which mysql packet must i install ?
[08:54] <Firefishe> KenSentMe: Is there a list of just the compiled kernel modules?
[08:54] <coz_> daywalker, well I hope you get it fixed
[08:54] <poquedoraqu> I installed the package for an opengl device because i wanted to see if I could do better with my 3d graphics stuff if I did. The installer said to use some sort of command to activate it, and i pasted that into the terminal. It said 'X' needs to reboot. When i rebooted, it wouldnt let me back into linux at all! I get a blue screen with a square in the middle >.<
[08:54] <elmargol> Firefishe: egrep =y /boot/config*
[08:54] <fnf> vik: Does '/usr/lib/firefox/plugins/' contain a copy of flash 7 ? I guess it doesn't though, either way, try removing the plugin in your home dir first then accessing a flash site to see if Fx works normally.
[08:54] <poquedoraqu> how can i save myself
[08:54] <dooglus> nothlit: I'm not running ubuntu at the moment, so maybe it would be different if I was, but I see documentation only for Name, Directory, Type, Total and Used.  No mention of 'Free' or 'Available'
[08:54] <Admiral_Chicago> ndowens: C++ or Fortan imho
[08:55] <elmargol> and egrep =m /boot/config*
[08:55] <Admiral_Chicago> but that belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic
[08:55] <yogeshitbhu> hi
[08:55] <nothlit> dooglus, yes its the same for me, what distro are you running?
[08:55] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: what package did you install?
[08:55] <dooglus> nothlit: I'm running debian sid at the moment
[08:55] <coz_> yogeshitbhu, welcome
[08:55] <dooglus> nothlit: so I guess most things will be pretty similar to edgy anyway for the moment
[08:55] <poquedoraqu> There were two.... i cant remember, one had an extra tag to its name
[08:55] <brocoli> how i can get my adsl working on edgy??
[08:55] <poquedoraqu> but i installed the one without it
[08:55] <koresko> Going to bed.  Thanks guys.
[08:55] <roycebarber> I..need...to know... how do i install downloaded gnome themes. i know nothing of this process.
[08:55] <ndowens> Admiral_Chicago: i know just wanted a idea from someone in here
[08:56] <daywalker> coz. same.Strange how i can ping net addresses though - maybe its a ver6 problem?
[08:56] <poquedoraqu> It said 'for newer boards'... i hope mine's new :(
[08:56] <daywalker> does dapper also use ipv6?
[08:56] <vik> fnf: it has a copy of flash 9. Will try removing it from there to see if firefox still thinks it has flash 7
[08:56] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: where did you get it?
[08:56] <coz_> roycebarber, you can go to gnomelook.org
[08:56] <Regurgitator> can someone help me pretty please? lol the ubuntu faw said to check here for support
[08:56] <poquedoraqu> It was from the 'add/remove' list
[08:56] <sith-lord> sup?
[08:56] <yogeshitbhu> i am a newbe to ubuntu .....  as we use your-freedom in windows for proxy is thr ny substitute for ubuntu
[08:56] <yogeshitbhu> ??
[08:56] <zircx> aw man that zooms now iter
[08:56] <Admiral_Chicago> roycebarber: i think the link is gnome-look.org
[08:56] <poquedoraqu> I can get into Linux terminal, but not into gnome. :(
[08:56] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: ah, than there shouldn't be any problems
[08:57] <nothlit> dooglus, its already behind though right? as soon as the upstream freeze hits in dev ubuntu starts lagging behind?
[08:57] <poquedoraqu> But why wont it load up?
[08:57] <fnf> vik: go on, you may delete both of them (/usr/lib and ~/.mozilla), perhaps firefox went crazy after the installation.
[08:57] <coz_> roycebarber, then when you download the theme of choice you go to system/prferences/theme and hit the install theme button locate the downoaded file and click ok
[08:57] <dooglus> yogeshitbhu: what does 'your-freedom' do?
[08:57] <sith-lord> investigating
[08:57] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: can you find some errors in /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
[08:57] <brocoli>  how i can get my adsl working on edgy??
[08:57] <yogeshitbhu> it speeds up the net access
[08:57] <dooglus> nothlit: that's right.  I get 30 or 40 updates per day on sid
[08:57] <vik> fnf: just got rid of the one in /usr/lib, and it no longer thinks it has flash 7.
[08:57] <KenSentMe> brocoli: what modem do you use?
[08:57] <daywalker> brocoli, mine also dosent :)
[08:58] <poquedoraqu> Well when i checked the error log it gave me it said "NVIDIA: no matching device section for instance (BUS ID PCI:1:0:0
[08:58] <dooglus> nothlit: although in some areas edgy is ahead; sid is still using evolution 2.6.3 for example
[08:58] <roycebarber> Does anyone know if the preview install of Flash9 is stable, because CNET video's seem to require it. Not a big deal, im just slightly curious.
[08:58] <daywalker> i use dlink
[08:58] <fnf> vik: That's sort of the problem, if you have flash 7 installed via aptitude and put flash 9 plugin in your home, /sometimes/ firefox insists on running the 7 version, that's weird but a minor issue.
[08:58] <KenSentMe> !justask | Regurgitator
[08:58] <ubotu> Regurgitator: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:58] <poquedoraqu> Otherwise i dont know, im not extremely familiar with this terminal
[08:58] <nothlit> dooglus, i heard when no bugs are reported for two weeks packages from unstable move to testing?
[08:58] <Regurgitator> lol yes but i did before, i shall re-ask
[08:58] <dooglus> roycebarber: I find flash 9 locks up after 3 to 5 minutes of playing videos at youtube.com
[08:58] <Regurgitator> does anyone know how i could solve this as i would really like to try out ubuntu but these display limitations are preventing me
[08:59] <nothlit> dooglus, is that because ubuntu has such close ties with gnome?
[08:59] <Regurgitator> oops wrong text string sorry
[08:59] <vik> fnf: now I got rid of it from ~/.mozilla, and put it back in /usr/lib, and firefox tells me I'm running version 7 again. Wierd
[08:59] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: you could try running sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:59] <Regurgitator> is there something i can do to stabilize the screen with my ati card so that i can install ubuntu? i tried both 640X480 and 800X600 resolutions which are resolutions i already know worked on windows
[08:59] <dooglus> nothlit: I don't know about debian testing or ubuntu's ties with gnome, sorry :)
[08:59] <roycebarber> Dooglus thank you very much for letting me know flash9 isnt ready. You saved me a lot of troubble. :D
[08:59] <chuckyp> vik, if you make a link in /usr/share/firefox/plugins  it will be there for all users.  You  porobably have to remove the 7 first
[08:59] <brocoli> daywalker, before i have hoary and my adsl work fine, now i cant configure because i dont have console
[08:59] <yogeshitbhu> net is very shit in our college so it needs to use some other sources for tunnelling and speeding up the net
[08:59] <chuckyp> roycebarber, no problems here with 9
[08:59] <coz_> Regurgitator, I don;'t know guy, someone here who does will get to your question,
[09:00] <KenSentMe> Regurgitator: what do you mean with stabilize?
[09:00] <eyequeue> !language
[09:00] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:00] <dooglus> roycebarber: it might be a problem with my setup.  I'm using 'aoss firefox' to run firefox with OSS emulation (or something).  that might be causing the problems.
[09:00] <vik> chuckyp: I _did_ remove version 7. But firefox insists I have version 7 installed
[09:00] <fnf> vik: It's likely to be some orphan configuration stays put after flash 7 removal, another good idea to mess with your own home directory rather than root's btw. ;)
[09:00] <dooglus> roycebarber: it's pretty quick and easy to switch in the v9 plugin temporarily to test it
[09:00] <poquedoraqu> So i type ' sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ' ?
[09:00] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: yes

[09:01] <nothlit> dooglus, ahh kk ty for your help
[09:01] <roycebarber> I couldnt get flash9 to install anyway. The firefox directory wont let me paste any files, it says i dont have permission.
[09:01] <chuckyp> vik, how did you remove it?
[09:01] <poquedoraqu> And what will this do? LOL i sound so stupid
[09:01] <vik> chuckyp: apt-get remove flashplugin-nonfree
[09:01] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: reconfigure your xserver
[09:01] <chuckyp> vik, uninstall flash-plugin  then just dl the flash 9 tar.gz extract and put it in /usr/share/mozilla-firefox/plugins/ folder
[09:01] <poquedoraqu> Right, will i have to do anything?
[09:01] <firebird619> chuckyp, I have uninstalled Beryl. I then ran the command to reconfigure X and just tried the i810 driver, it does the same as before, sticks at blank screen, switched it to vesa, and it works as far as getting to login screen.
[09:01] <chuckyp> vik, and it will be there for all users.
[09:01] <NoisRevBus> hello, i have a strange bug and i vaguely recall reading about it somewhere but the forums don't seem to be working for me
[09:02] <NoisRevBus> when i have azureus running, i have no sound
[09:02] <KenSentMe> poquedoraqu: yes, choose the nv driver and then use all the default options
[09:02] <Regurgitator> (KenSentMe): i mean its like its set to a wrong resolution or something i see like 5 or 6 mouse pointers and such
[09:02] <chuckyp> firebird619, okay so definately a problem with the i810 driver then?
[09:02] <vik> chuckyp: I've also combed through my hard disk for any other instances of libflashplugin.so, which there are none of. But firefox still insists its version 7
[09:02] <dooglus> roycebarber: I put the plugin here: ls -l ~/.mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[09:02] <NoisRevBus> does anyone know anything about this?
[09:02] <KenSentMe> Regurgitator: is this in the installer or have you installed ubuntu already?
[09:02] <dooglus> roycebarber: you don't need root privs to copy it there hopefully
[09:02] <Regurgitator> in the installer, i wish to install it
[09:02] <brocoli> daywalker, did you try pppoeconf on console?
[09:02] <vik> chuckyp: though interstingly it seems to actually run as flash 9
[09:03] <bdragonmsl> !xgl
[09:03] <poquedoraqu> Thank you so much :) if that doesnt work, nay way to force gnome up anyway?
[09:03] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL)  -  Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager  -  Help in #ubuntu-xgl  -  See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[09:03] <firebird619> chuckyp, Yes, evidently, with vesa though, when I get to the login screen I login, it logs in then goes to screen that looks like it's running fschk, and then straight back to login screen.
[09:03] <roycebarber> Is there a way to tell Ubuntu to stop restricting my permissions. i
[09:03] <fnf> chuckup: That doesn't really work if flash 9 doesn't play nicely with your computer, in which case, you'll need root permission all the time to fix the problem, and what if other users don't want any kind of annoying flash ads ?
[09:03] <KenSentMe> Regurgitator: you could try donwloading the alternate cd, it uses a text-based installer
[09:03] <chuckyp> vik, I'm sorry my link is in /usr/lib/firefox/plguins
[09:03] <daywalker> brocoli, no have you?
[09:04] <KenSentMe> !alternate | Regurgitator
[09:04] <ubotu> Regurgitator: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[09:04] <^Ocean^> is there a way too tell whats useing a kernel module ?
[09:04] <Regurgitator> (KenSentMe): worth a shot but are there any other alternatives?
[09:04] <vik> chuckyp: they're the same; mozilla-firefox is a symlink to firefox
[09:04] <^Ocean^> im trying to rmmod something but it says its in use... so how to i tell whats useing it ?
[09:04] <KenSentMe> Regurgitator: i wouldn't know
[09:04] <daywalker> brocoli, im not near my linux pc right now
[09:04] <chuckyp> vik, okay well I know it works.   SO make sure flash-plugin and anything related to flash is uninstalled.  Try dpkg -l | grep flash
[09:04] <KenSentMe> roycebarber: what are you trying to do?
[09:05] <dooglus> roycebarber: if you run "sudo nautilus" you'll be able to copy and paste anything wherever you like, but be careful - those permissions are set up to stop you messing things up
[09:05] <chuckyp> vik, then download the flash 9 beta and just put it in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
[09:05] <roycebarber> KenSentMe, im trying to install Flash9, but i dont have permission to do so. I'm not familiar with the Terminal at all.
[09:05] <chuckyp> vik, then restart firefox go to about:plugins  and you will see it is flash9
[09:05] <KenSentMe> roycebarber: how are you trying to install flash9?
[09:05] <KenSentMe> !flash9 | roycebarber
[09:05] <ubotu> roycebarber: Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[09:05] <vik> chuckyp: done all that; firefox still thinks it's version 7. Hence the questions
[09:05] <dooglus> roycebarber: probably I should say "gksu nautilus" to appease the "don't-use-sudo-for-x11-apps" nazis
[09:06] <ndlovu> any recommendations on a tool to spider a website for offline viewing?
[09:06] <KenSentMe> ndlovu: wget
[09:06] <brocoli> daywalker, in previous versions of ubuntu work but my problem is that now i havent console, if you have it maybe work
[09:06] <ndlovu> KenSentMe, wow, wget seems pretty versatile
[09:08] <firebird619> What is an alternative to use to the i810 driver that comes with Edgy, and something other than vesa?
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[09:08] <Regurgitator> whats the text i need to put in advanced boot options to enable expert mode (edgy)
[09:09] <chuckyp> vik, well there is a pluginsreg.dat or something like that that references the version
[09:09] <KenSentMe> Regurgitator: in the alternate cd you mean. I don believe the live-cd has an expert mode
[09:10] <Regurgitator> oh i wouldnt know, i saw something like it in help saying to enable expert mode but with no explanations
[09:10] <chuckyp> vik, .mozilla/firefox/pluginreg.dat  you could try changing the version in there.  but that shouldn't really effect it.  I would try renaming tha tfile and restarting firefox seeing what it says about the version.   It will recreate the file.
[09:10] <domster> Is there a nice easy to install vnc server package. All the packages I've checked out need further configuration (xinetd and the like)
[09:11] <domster> and ubuntuguide is digg'd out, so I can't check there
[09:11] <KenSentMe> domster: vnc is already in ubuntu
[09:12] <KenSentMe> domster: go to System - Preferences - Remote Desktop
[09:12] <vik> chuckyp: nup; still thinks version 7 is in there; and it didn't re-create the file
[09:12] <domster> KenSentMe, yep, true. Where does it log to, because I'm having auth issues
[09:12] <KenSentMe> domster: logs are all in /var/log, so you could check there
[09:12] <domster> KenSentMe, I did.
[09:12] <vik> giving up now
[09:13] <nothlit> dooglus, i found out how packages move into testing http://www.debian.org/devel/testing
[09:14] <kzm> I have a VIA-based mainboard - I know it can monitor its temperatures, since it can display them in the BIOS, but how can I read temperatures from Linux?
[09:15] <firebird619> I just restarted my PC and it said Failed to start X. VESA: No  matching modes and Screens found but none have a usable configuration. Fatal Server Error: no screens found.
[09:19] <Madpilot> kzm, the site seems down right now, but check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto later when it's available
[09:19] <spanglesontoast> grr can't get this damn 3d accel working with fglrx
[09:19] <Lathiat> spanglesontoast: what kind of card?
[09:19] <spanglesontoast> radeon 9600
[09:19] <spanglesontoast> from what I've googled I'm guessing it's about xgl
[09:20] <spanglesontoast> but then again most of you guys are once step ahead of me
[09:20] <Madpilot> spanglesontoast, from what I've read, XGL & ATI don't always play nice together. I've never had issues w/ basic fglrx & my 9600XT, though
[09:20] <spanglesontoast> but isn't xgl the 3d accel
[09:21] <Madpilot> no. XGL is the wobbly desktop thingie.
[09:21] <spanglesontoast> oh
[09:21] <spanglesontoast> so why don't I have 3d accel ?
[09:21] <roycebarber> Running "sudo nautilus" is exactly what I needed to get the permission to install Flash9. It seems to work well!! :D
[09:21] <Madpilot> fglrx is 3d accel
[09:21] <spanglesontoast> could it be because I've installed xgl ?
[09:21] <Regurgitator> a friend of mine also had a similar problem than the one i have with my video cards and told me he had to get it to stop trying to use the monitor drivers and made it use Xorg, if anyone knows how i could do this from the edgy cd please help me out
[09:21] <Qualc1> spanglesontoast: you get errors in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[09:22] <xukun> anyone having start up problems with vmware workstation after upgrading to Ubuntu edgy?

[09:25] <Link9618> Which respository on the sources.list is firestarter in?
[09:25] <tamacracker> Hey guys... I'm havin a hard time findin my trash can lol
[09:25] <Adriano> !ubotu firestarter
[09:25] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

[09:26] <Gustap0> Hi, how do I share an internet connection via a windows machine? Do i just assign an address like 192.168.0.x in the /etc/network files?

[09:27] <tamacracker> can some one tell me where the trash can is located?
[09:27] <tamacracker> nevermind.
[09:28] <Adriano> they make it way too easy
[09:28] <Adriano> answering their own questions before we have a chance...
[09:28] <Adriano> not fair, man, not fair
[09:28] <Gustap0> Ok, if you want to answer a question, then answer mine (please :P).
[09:29] <Regurgitator> or mine even lol
[09:29] <Feldegast> Gustap0 is the windows pc the client or the server?
[09:29] <daywalker> brocoli, any improvement?
[09:29] <Gustap0> I'm trying to get the linux box connected to the internet via a windows machine. Usually, with dial-up, i'd need to setup the resolv.conf file and then some.
[09:29] <Gustap0> Feldegast- the server. or gateway
[09:30] <Gustap0> and its got an adsl connection- picks up the ip dynamically.
[09:30] <Link9618> Thank you
[09:30] <Feldegast> Gustap0 then u set up ICS on the windows pc, then on the linux pc u set the gateway to 192.168.0.1 and u set the dns on the linux pc to the ISP's DNS
[09:31] <milamber> someone nows why k3b suddenly stoped working, it will try to start with burning, buth doesnt do anything, it worked before
[09:31] <Gustap0> uh huh. and it'll work right outta the box if i hook 'em up both using an ethernet cable right? no routers/switches involved. just mano-a-mano ethernet cards doing their business.
[09:31] <Feldegast> Gustap0 the adsl device, is it a router?
[09:32] <Gustap0> no, a usb-modem.
[09:32] <Feldegast> Gustap0 it will but ICS is flaky
[09:32] <Mike2k6> hello, i have a problem with frostwire, i downloaded it, but it wont connect
[09:33] <kzm> Madpilot, thanks.
[09:33] <Feldegast> when you set up ICS on the server pc it will set bridging and other things
[09:34] <milamber> nobuddy? ive tried it also with differant burn-programs, like eg nero, and xcdroast buth all have the same problem, they will start buth do nothing with the empty disk, and hangs afther a while
[09:34] <Gustap0> Feldegast- i'd have chosen to connect the modem to the linux box. only problem is the adsl-driver. which is provided by that eagle-usb modem driver mod. I don't know how to re-route (or is it called bridging?) the internet connection to the ethernet card on the linux box.
[09:34] <xukun> which packages to I need to install the development tools?
[09:34] <Gustap0> xukun: perhaps build-essentials?
[09:35] <Feldegast> Gustap0 that's why i don't use USB
[09:36] <gourdin> anyone knows why I got this output http://pastebin.co.uk/4941 when doing a dist-upgrade in edgy eft ?
[09:36] <Adriano> Gustap0: yes, most people strongly recommend to use ethernet adsl modem/routers if possible
[09:36] <crimsun> gourdin: are you using any non-Canonical repositories?
[09:36] <kleinlappies> is there a good thunderbird backup program or command?
[09:37] <gourdin> crimsun: ?
[09:37] <gourdin> hmmm
[09:37] <Feldegast> gourdin try running it again?
[09:37] <Adriano> kleinlappies: copying the .thunderbird or .mozilla-thunderbird dir somewhere else?
[09:37] <gourdin> crimsun: I'm coming from dapper wich used a mirror to install aiglx
[09:37] <AWOSDev> My floppy drive doesn't work, it didn't get created for some reason (as in, even with sudo, /dev/fd0 doesn't exist).
[09:38] <Gustap0> Adriano: never doubted that. Just giving one whack at the device the ISP provided me with. thanks all.
[09:38] <Adriano> .mozilla-thunderbird in Edgy
[09:38] <gourdin> now i'm only using ubuntu mirror for edgy
[09:38] <AWOSDev> Adriano, .mozilla-thunderbird in Dapper, too.
[09:38] <AWOSDev> I had to fiddle with it last night.
[09:38] <Adriano> Gustap0: I haven't really been following this chan, just trying to make gaim crash, sorry
[09:38] <roycebarber> Democracy Player is so awesome! I didn't know it even ran in linux. This is incredible. Gleeeee!!! I love watching Leo Laporte, and now i can.. hehehe...
[09:39] <AWOSDev> dd: opening `/dev/fd0': No such file or directory
[09:39] <AWOSDev> stat: cannot stat `/dev/fd0': No such file or directory
[09:39] <AWOSDev> :-(
[09:39] <AWOSDev> ^^ That's with sudo on it too
[09:39] <Gustap0> whatis democracy player? :P i smell al-gore.
[09:39] <crimsun> gourdin: ok, is 'ubuntu-desktop' installde?
[09:39] <gourdin> crimsun: perhaps a --reinstall of some package ?
[09:39] <crimsun> installed, even
[09:39] <Adriano> AWOSDev: are you sure your floppy is still there in sftab?
[09:39] <Adriano> after the Great Renaming to UUID, I mean
[09:40] <nomad111> can some1 tell me why i don t get water effects with beryl, i have an intel 945gm card
[09:40] <AWOSDev> Adriano, Well, I have Dapper for one thing.  and I'm not trying to mount it.
[09:40] <gourdin> crimsun: kubuntu desktop was installed before dist-upgrading to edgy
[09:40] <AWOSDev> I want to dd from it!
[09:40] <xx2trouble> anybosy know about localisation? i wanna thai desktop but thai-system is broken
[09:40] <brynk> i still can't print on my epson aculaser c1100 in edgy
[09:40] <brynk> FIX IT
[09:40] <brynk> :)
[09:40] <gourdin> now It seems to be deleted
[09:40] <Qualc1> spanglesontoast: if you disable AIGLX, with ---Option "AIGLX" "false"--- in /etc/X11/xorg.conf does 3D accel works ?
[09:40] <Adriano> AWOSDev: I can't help you much, since I tore out the floppy unit from my 'puter long ago, and it didn't work to begin with
[09:40] <kleinlappies> Adriano, so could i do a cron job to copy the .mozilla-thunderbird dir to another place like everyday at 11:00
[09:40] <nomad111> brynk, wats the printer problem
[09:41] <Adriano> kleinlappies: yes, rsync should help you there
[09:41] <AWOSDev> okay well goodnight
[09:41] <spanglesontoast> erm well I think I was paranoid
[09:41] <brynk> it just sits there doing nothing, job stopped, giving a foomatic-rip error
[09:41] <crimsun> gourdin: I would remove any external packages (that didn't originate from archive.ubuntu.com), reinstall kubuntu-desktop, then update && dist-upgrade again
[09:41] <spanglesontoast> it's just the transgaming thing said no 3d acce
[09:41] <gourdin> crimsun: ok
[09:41] <gourdin> I'll try
[09:41] <Adriano> kleinlappies: try the official site for better strategies, it's almost surely a FAQ or at least in the manual
[09:41] <gary_> hello all, I'm wondering if anyone can provide me with direction (search terms for ubuntu forums would even be great) for an issue where I can see a shared xp folder, view the contents, browse subfolders, and even open .txt and image files, but mp3 files will not play (they play if I copy them to a local folder).  I'm using ubuntu 6.10 currently
[09:42] <spanglesontoast> what difference will that make Qualcl
[09:42] <kleinlappies> Adriano, K will look at that thanks.
[09:42] <gary_> if I open them in xmms, they show up in the playlist, but pressing 'play' simply doesn't seem to do anything
[09:42] <frying_fish> gary_: you don't have the gnome-vfs attributes for your players
[09:42] <Feldegast> gourdin i found that the cdromupgrade on the install cd worked around those
[09:42] <frying_fish> as they can't play directly over samba
[09:43] <gourdin> Feldegast: ho
[09:43] <brynk> nomad111: it just sits there doing nothing, job stopped, giving a foomatic-rip error (also see https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/68183)
[09:43] <Qualc1> it should disable aiglx
[09:43] <gary_> frying_fish: that's it? :) sorry to waste your time then..
[09:43] <Adriano> I'd like to know why local mp3 or ogg files will not "preview" (as in "play") anymore if I hover over them, even with audio preview enabled for files of those sizes
[09:43] <frying_fish> you will either need to mount the folder (to make it think its a local file) or find a package that will add the "play over samba" functionality for your player.
[09:43] <gourdin> hmmmm
[09:43] <nomad111> brynk, strange
[09:43] <gourdin> --reinstall some packages seems to work
[09:43] <frying_fish> Adriano: apt-get install mpg321
[09:43] <Adriano> thanks
[09:43] <Feldegast> apt-get distupgrade when i did it didn't upgrade everything, the cdromupgrade on the cd did (at least) python
[09:43] <Adriano> will try
[09:43] <stylus> where could i find these? checking for X... no
[09:43] <stylus> configure: error: X development libraries not found
[09:44] <frying_fish> stylus: what you trying to compile?
[09:44] <nomad111> brynk, strange sorry i thought i could help
[09:44] <gourdin> Feldegast: ok, thx for th tips
[09:44] <stylus> gtk+
[09:44] <gourdin> Feldegast: I'm trying --reinstall some package =)
[09:44] <Feldegast> :)
[09:44] <milamber> howto set cdrecord suid root ?
[09:44] <frying_fish> stylus: why? why not just use the one that comes with ubuntu. its the latest stable version
[09:44] <frying_fish> milamber: ask google
[09:44] <spanglesontoast> but I'd love to get beryl working
[09:45] <stylus> frying_fish: i see
[09:45] <Adriano> frying_fish: ok, that was really stupid, but worked. Why didn't it tell me anything before?
[09:45] <Feldegast> beryl+xgl looks nice, heavy on the cpu tho
[09:45] <frying_fish> because it just doesn't tell you
[09:45] <Adriano> I mean, why let me enable something that won't work?
[09:45] <Adriano> I'm filing a bug, it's just too stupid
[09:45] <frying_fish> Feldegast: see if yours can do beryl just by using xorg7.1, if its nvidia, then with the beta drivers it should.
[09:46] <roycebarber> I'm randomly curious. Anyone know if Google is going to.. 1.) release their own linux distro. 2.) finance development of ubuntu.
[09:46] <Adriano> or browsing for one...
[09:46] <frying_fish> Adriano: go file a bug, but again its a package that won't be included by default (mp3 licensing)
[09:46] <Adriano> roycebarber: 1) they said no. 2) doubt it
[09:46] <Adriano> frying_fish: at least for ogg files, it should work
[09:46] <Feldegast> frying_fish i tried installing the beta drivers yesterday and it killed X completly, had to downgrade them
[09:46] <Adriano> or not let me do it in the first place
[09:46] <frying_fish> well ok then, just use the xgl for now
[09:46] <tur1> hi just a quick question is ubuntu website down?
[09:47] <frying_fish> as xorg7.1 doesn't eat the cpu but if it crashes then don't use it.
[09:47] <frying_fish> tur1: nope.
[09:47] <tur1> mm
[09:47] <crimsun> tur1: routing issues upstream.
[09:47] <tur1> i could not access it
[09:47] <gorndog> same here, tur1
[09:47] <crimsun> you may or may not experience said routing issues.
[09:48] <tur1> ok, let me check
[09:48] <tur1> thanks
[09:48] <Feldegast> frying_fish i have latest xorg, just not the beta nvidia drivers
[09:48] <crimsun> (it's known)
[09:48] <frying_fish> Feldegast: yes, but for nvidia it will only do it using just xorg 7.1 with the latest beta drivers, as the earlier ones don't support the extensions

[09:48] <gorndog> tur1, ubuntuforums.org also.
[09:48] <Feldegast> k
[09:49] <Adriano> frying_fish: it doesn't even work for ogg files, it's reedeeculous
[09:49] <frying_fish> because mpg321 is a program that isn't installed by default
[09:49] <frying_fish> and they haven't written something like ogg321 (so if you want it, go do it yourself...)
[09:49] <Adriano> sure, but I installed it right now, it works with mp3 giles
[09:49] <Adriano> *files
[09:50] <Adriano> and ogg123 used to exist, and isn't in the edgy repos
=== apecat_ is now known as apecat
[09:51] <frying_fish> I know you installed it, but you were arguing its stupid that it doesn't do it by default, but mpg321 isn't installed by default because of licensing and certain laws in certain countries.
[09:51] <Adriano> I'm arguing that for free .ogg files it should work and it doesn't
[09:52] <RMorris84> how can i install guifications for gaim 2.0 beta 3?
[09:52] <Adriano> and I'm arguing that if it's at all unallowed in certain countries, and requires a package installation, nautilus shouldn't let me just enable the thing
[09:52] <sverek> hello, when running eclipse in edgy i get the same error as this guy (in french) anybody know a fix? http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=71854
[09:53] <sverek> i have tried with gcj and sun java and same error
[09:53] <frying_fish> sure it could, because then it is up to you to install it
[09:53] <frying_fish> so any issues with laws are at your discretion.
[09:53] <Adriano> for .ogg files?
[09:53] <hintswen> Is there a program that i can use o watch TV?(I have a TV tuner card)
[09:53] <frying_fish> hintswen: mythtv.
[09:53] <Feldegast> hintswen myth tv?
[09:54] <Regurgitator> if anyone knows how i can make the ubuntu installer load with the Xorg instead of the default video drivers let me know
[09:54] <sparr> hintswen: xawtv (maybe?  ive heard of it, never used it)
[09:54] <sparr> Regurgitator: xorg has nothing to do with video drivers
[09:54] <hintswen> do i need the right drivers for my TV card to use myth tv?
[09:54] <frying_fish> Regurgitator: rephrase your question to make some sense.
[09:54] <frying_fish> hintswen: most probably.
[09:54] <sparr> hintswen: drivers are good.  but you dont HAVE to have them.  generics, even generic v4l drivers for dumb capture, will work
[09:54] <frying_fish> sparr: lies.
[09:54] <gorndog> crimsun: is there any site that explains routing issue or gives status?  I'm assuming many affected ..., as I cannot even get to it from two different ISPs, nor from any proxies that I tried (e.g., hidemyass.com)
[09:54] <hintswen> dam, I checked and there's only windows 2k/XP drivers for it
[09:55] <frying_fish> about xorg not having anything to do video drivers.
[09:55] <sparr> hintswen: the drivers listed by the company are rarely the same as the drivers youll find in linux
[09:55] <sparr> frying_fish: of course.
[09:55] <Feldegast> hintswen what tv card is it?
[09:55] <hintswen> well I think it's actually my graphics card, WinFast PX6600 GT
[09:56] <stylus> configure: error: Library requirements (  libxml-2.0 >= 2.4.10   atk >= 1.0.0   gtk+-2.0 >= 2.4.0   glib-2.0 >= 2.4.0) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.
[09:56] <Regurgitator> i dont even know what im saying myself lol, all i know is im new to ubuntu and my friend uses another nix on which he had the same problem as i do with my video card, he said he had to make it stop trying to use the monitor drivers and made it use Xorg
[09:56] <crimsun> gorndog: I don't know of one off the top of my head
[09:56] <Feldegast> hintswen that doesn't have a tv tuner
[09:56] <stylus> frying_fish: my dependancies are higher than what it needs
[09:56] <hintswen> says it does here
[09:56] <stylus> why can't it use them?
[09:56] <hintswen> http://www.leadtek.com.tw/eng/3d_graphic/overview.asp?lineid=1&pronameid=147
[09:56] <sparr> stylus: dependencies are not always "this version or higher", some require a specific version
[09:56] <hintswen> says it has HDTV support
[09:57] <stylus> sparr: so i need to install those exact versions?
[09:57] <Feldegast> hintswen it has HDTV OUT
[09:57] <ndlovu> I'm trying to convert single page pdf files to 2-page-per-sheet pdfs, but it loses the first page for some reason. Any ideas why it's not working?
[09:57] <ndlovu> pdf2ps kyoto2002.pdf - | mpage -2 -bA4 | ps2pdf - kyoto2002-2.pdf
[09:57] <sparr> stylus: maybe.  i dont know.  im speaking generically
[09:57] <hintswen> right, well i'm on windows right now lol
[09:58] <Feldegast> hintswen it doesn't have a Tuner, it might have video in.....
[09:58] <hintswen> I'll try figure out what my tv tuner card is then
[09:58] <stylus> sparr: that doesn't really help me :(
[09:58] <ndlovu> that's single page-per-sheet pdfs...
[09:58] <hintswen> I'm watching TV on my computer right now
=== lux_ is now known as lux`
[09:58] <Feldegast> hintswen what software are you using?
[09:58] <RollDice> Hey all, anyone here have experience with compiz/beryl under ubuntu edgy eft? My GDM keeps restarting when I enable GD display or load an XGL session
[09:58] <hintswen> WinFast DTV
[09:59] <frying_fish> stylus: do you have -dev versions of each of those?
[09:59] <Feldegast> hintswen in that software, go into settings and tell me what divice it is using
[09:59] <frying_fish> stylus: these are >= so they can be greater than, but make sure you have the -dev version of the packages.
[10:00] <Regurgitator> (frying_fish): did it make more sense that time?
[10:00] <hintswen> WinFast DTV 1000T BDA DVB-T Tuner/Demon (Thomson DTT7579)
[10:00] <Feldegast> hintswen same as my card :)
[10:00] <frying_fish> Regurgitator: not really, what is your graphics card, (we might figure it out from that)
[10:00] <stylus> ok, i'm finding them now frying_fish
[10:00] <hintswen> yay i'm not the only person with this card lol
[10:01] <Regurgitator> i have an ati radeon
[10:01] <Feldegast> your card is "WinFast DTV 1000T"
[10:01] <frying_fish> Regurgitator: which model.
[10:01] <frying_fish> there are a lot....
[10:01] <ndlovu> or is there a better way to convert pdfs using ghostscript rather than a combination of pdf2ps, mpage and ps2pdf?
[10:01] <Feldegast> hintswen, next isue is getting it working under linux.....now i havn't tried mine yet....
[10:02] <brynk> so.. i'm downloading fedora and thinking about installing it
[10:02] <Regurgitator> (frying_fish): radeon 7000
[10:02] <donfilipo> anyone can tell how to enable XGL in Edgy i have heart it should be easy
[10:03] <Feldegast> brynk i know a lot of ppl who have fedora, have got fed up with it and are moving to ubuntu
[10:03] <hintswen> Feldegast, would it work running under a virtual machine?
[10:03] <kzm> I'm trying out Thunderbird, but when trying to reply to an email, the crappy editor just gives me a bunch of red frames with funny symbols on them.  Apparently, one is just supposed to return each entire mail along with one's response.  Let me guess: it is still impossible to use a real editor to compose mails?
[10:03] <frying_fish> Regurgitator: ok then, right do : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:03] <Feldegast> hintswen no, it needs a driver, it is HDTV so i don't know how well it will work
[10:03] <frying_fish> and then when it suggests a driver use the "radeon" or "ati" option (probably radeon is best)
[10:04] <Regurgitator> (frying_fish): input that in the advanced boot options?
[10:04] <frying_fish> Regurgitator: no
[10:04] <hintswen> Feldegast, I just checked and there's only WinXP drivers :(
[10:04] <Regurgitator> ubuntu is not yet installed on my system if i hadnt mentioned that
[10:04] <frying_fish> no you didn't mention that
[10:04] <frying_fish> at which point the cd you put in will most likely detect which one you want anyway
[10:04] <frying_fish> so just what it suggests.
[10:05] <Feldegast> hintswen the winfast website won't have linux drivers, you'd need to look elsewhere
[10:05] <brynk> Feldegast: yeah well, i'm kinda fed up with ubuntu, i've been a haapy user since it first got out but i've put a lot of time in getting my printer to work in edgy and there's not much hope of it getting fixed. i've asked questions on forums and filed bugs, but noone seems to want to help, so i've kind of had it
[10:06] <Regurgitator> well the problem is no matter what resolution i try its always as though its the wrong one, i get the menu that asks if i want to install or check cd for defects etc to come up properly but as soon as it loads into the installer it seems to go to a wrong resoltion
[10:06] <Feldegast> brynk what printer?
[10:06] <mnepton> brynk: have you spoken to your printer's manufacturer?
[10:06] <gorndog> crimsun: thanks, routing issue appears to be resolved now.
[10:06] <brynk> Feldegast: epson aculaser c1100
[10:07] <frying_fish> Regurgitator: well just deal with the wrong resolution for the install (or, either change it in the system->preferences->resolution) option, or kill X, and edit the xorg config it has
[10:07] <Feldegast> an epson printer doesn't work? strange
[10:07] <frying_fish> just install it with a bad resolution, then fix it after install
[10:07] <brynk> mnepton: the printer works fine in dapper, the drivers aren't great though
[10:07] <frying_fish> its like windows, windows will only install on something like 800x600 (unless you give it a nice little hack to get a command prompt open and force it to change resolution)

[10:08] <sandy16> how to reinstall grub loader ?
[10:09] <mnepton> brynk: have you spoken to Epson about it?
[10:09] <mnepton> brynk: and it seems to just be a .ppd, which you sould be able to set up via GNOME's printer dialogs
[10:09] <brynk> mnepton: no, i kinda have to do it with the drivers pointed to at the site you just linked

[10:13] <hintswen> ok
[10:14] <Feldegast> it's setting that card up in linux
[10:14] <sandy16> can any body help to reinstall my grub loader on dapper 6.06?
[10:16] <webben> It looks like my old Thinkpad is on its last legs. Is anyone here running Ubuntu on Parallels, and if so, what's that like?
[10:16] <SoftIce> I just want to warn people on ubuntu edgy upgrade, we had some nasty trouble with VOIP servers on the upgrade, a number of things not working..
[10:16] <SoftIce> make sure you stage your upgrade first
[10:16] <SoftIce> in #fedora
[10:17] <SoftIce> sorry.
[10:17] <roycebarber> WindowsXP has a file checking program. It restores origional files, to repair the system. Does Ubuntu have that. Also, does linux use a Registry??
[10:18] <Acke_ubu> hey i just installed fluxbox through synaptic. however, i cant auto generate menus. i tried with reconfigure from the menu and fluxbox-generate_menu in the terminal. any ideas??
[10:18] <Acke_ubu> !fluxbox
[10:18] <ubotu> fluxbox is a lightweight and responsive window manager for GNU/Linux. For how to set it up and more information see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fluxbox
[10:18] <roycebarber> Registry...Linux... anyone have an answer.
[10:19] <hdcool> roycebarber: thank god no
[10:19] <roycebarber> Haha thank you!
[10:19] <pty> roycebarber: it doesn't have a registry as such but gnome does have gconf which is registry like
[10:19] <hdcool> it uses flat files.. if you fuck up your system, remove the files and restart all over
[10:19] <DBO> hdcool, watch the swearing please =)
[10:19] <hdcool> hm :)
[10:19] <SoftIce> roycebarber: if I was you I would do a rsync backup of your system with an incremental solution.
=== glitchz is now known as glitch-
[10:20] <SoftIce> then if something goes bang or if you delete something just compare date()
[10:20] <SoftIce> and move backs the files that have changed since your system broke
[10:20] <roycebarber> Ok now to my next previous question. (And yeah, my kids use this channel so please people be nice). Also..softice thats a good idea. Ok... Does a file checking program exist, or a "Repair Install"?
[10:20] <roycebarber> I'
[10:21] <hdcool> in linux everything works kind off totally different.. :)
[10:21] <aterphasma> can someone recommend a good laptop network utility? roaming is not conducive to edgy working very well, i've found
[10:21] <hdcool> you won't need all those fancy tools
[10:21] <roycebarber> I'm compairing Windows backup features to Ubuntu, because im brand new user to linux and im having troubble wrapping my head around all this Terminal talk
[10:21] <frederick85> hdcool: there's some really crappy programs for linux too, look at this http://pooby.freds-webs.net
[10:22] <SoftIce> roycebarber: I have a nice backup solution on my site, http://www.security.web.za/rsync.htm
[10:22] <webben> roycebarber: the reason for the Terminal talk is it tends to get things done faster than describing how to do it with GUI
[10:22] <SoftIce> its pretty easy to follow, mainly cut and paste
[10:22] <hdcool> erm frederick85 ? :p
[10:22] <roycebarber> I imagine after i learn the basic terminal lingo, installing and editing files will be a lot easier. I hope anyway.
[10:22] <frederick85> hdcool: I MAde It :D
[10:23] <hdcool> :p
[10:23] <samu2> all right, so ubuntu is not working even though i did a fresh install
[10:23] <samu2> keeps throwing me out to the login screen constantly
[10:23] <scheuri> hi all
[10:23] <SoftIce> samu2: what is the issue?
[10:23] <webben> roycebarber: which application would you like to edit files with? (I assume you don't know vim or nano or pico or emacs, so you probably something GUI like gedit).
[10:23] <roycebarber> Random bit of data: I couldnt get my computer to boot to the Ubuntu 6.10 cd, so i had to install the previous ubuntu cd and then update it.
[10:24] <webben> roycebarber: so wherever a instruction for the Terminal says something like sudo vim /path/to/some/file
[10:24] <webben> roycebarber: just replace that with gksudo gedit /path/to/some/file
[10:24] <webben> that will launch gedit to edit the same file
[10:25] <webben> (I use Vim because it's a lot faster and fully featured, but it does take getting used to.)
[10:25] <samu2> SoftIce I only get to see the gnome desktop for maybe 15 seconds before I'm thrown out to the login screen again.
[10:25] <roycebarber> emacs im not sure, there are many things i like to edit and play with. webben, do you know of a site that explains Terminal lingo in a easy way.
[10:25] <SoftIce> samu2: well you need to check your x11 logs
[10:25] <SoftIce> and see whats causing it to crash, maybe monitor refresh rate, res, etc.
[10:26] <roycebarber> Anyone know why WINE bugs out so easily..? I'm thinking maybe I did something wrong. No biggie, im mildly curious and playing with it.
[10:26] <samu2> SoftIce all right, where are the x11 logs?
[10:26] <Regurgitator> Leaving Reason..::sleep::.. Time is now: 5:26am .UPP.
[10:26] <SoftIce> hehe, for all the years i'm used WINE its been buggy ;)
[10:26] <webben> roycebarber: maybe http://linux.org.mt/article/terminal is a basic guide to the shell (it's for bash, Ubuntu uses dash, but the differences don't need to worry you at this point)
[10:26] <SoftIce> samu2: all your logs sit in /var/log
[10:27] <SoftIce> just run 'tail -f logname'
[10:27] <SoftIce> and it will show the last part of the log and tail if anthing else is being passed to it.
[10:27] <webben> roycebarber: particularly worth learning the basic file/directory commands (mkdir (make directories), rm -r (to delete files and directories), ls -al (list files in current directory), cd (change to another director) )
=== ozant is now known as ozan
[10:28] <Magilla> if I do a dist-upgrade from dapper, what are the chances it will go horribly wrong?
[10:28] <stylus> it seems the au repository for ubuntu is down.
[10:28] <webben> roycebarber: other than that, one mainly uses /particular/ commands with the terminal which aren't really "terminal lingo" just applications in their own right
[10:28] <crimsun> Magilla: 50/50
[10:28] <roycebarber> I used to know all the DOS Prompt commands... so terminal is alien to me, yet im sure i'll soak it up fast.
[10:28] <Magilla> crimsun: they aren't promising odds...
[10:28] <webben> roycebarber: like apt-get, which is for "getting"/installing packages with the Apt package manager
[10:29] <crimsun> Magilla: no better, no worse.
[10:29] <webben> roycebarber: or apt-cache search (for searching potential packages for install)
[10:29] <webben> roycebarber: so there's not like one page to explain the terminal, any more than there'd be one page to explain Windows.
[10:29] <samu2> Isn't ctrl+alt+fx the shortcut to get to terminal x?
[10:29] <webben> samu2: yes
[10:30] <roycebarber> webben you bring up things i didnt realize, im going to play with apt-get and the other things you speak of. its facinating to flex the power of linux because its so different than windows.
[10:30] <samu2> ok, well it seems i made ubuntu crash by pressing ctrl+alt+f1
[10:30] <webben> roycebarber: If you used to know the DOS prompt, you won't have too much trouble easing into Terminal.
[10:30] <roycebarber> I'm going to ask a possibly dumb question: Does Linux use C++? Im sure it doesnt but i dont know.
[10:31] <sparr> roycebarber: it does
[10:31] <webben> roycebarber: Some applications are programmed in C++ yes.
[10:31] <sparr> webben: i think he mans linux itself
[10:31] <webben> oh
[10:32] <roycebarber> C++ works in linux? Then... why do c++ written programs not run on both windows and linux?
[10:32] <sparr> roycebarber: they do
[10:33] <roycebarber> So there is a common file extension that works in linux and windows..?
[10:33] <eyequeue> g++ (1)              - GNU project C and C++ compiler
[10:33] <sparr> hell, i know a c++ game that uses SDL for graphics that runs on windows, linux, osx, palm, zaurus, gp2x, psp, nintendo ds, gamecube, ps2, xbox
[10:33] <webben> roycebarber: it doesn't work quite like that
[10:33] <sparr> roycebarber: file extension?  sure.  .cc or .c++ or .cpp would work
[10:33] <samu2> SoftIce so, did you mean Xorg.0.log ?
[10:33] <webben> roycebarber: you have to recompile to run on the other OS
[10:33] <roycebarber> Haha this is quite the educational experience for me!
[10:33] <webben> roycebarber: and it depends on what libraries the C++ programs use
[10:34] <roycebarber> Webben the libraries idea is something i was wondering, thank you.
[10:34] <webben> roycebarber: e.g. to run on both windows and linux, it must use a GUI toolkit that works on both (e.g. GTK)
[10:34] <webben> roycebarber: or compile with a different toolkit on each system
[10:34] <CotRo|eR> i have set up proftpd on my ubuntu and when i acces it i cant write to it... how do i make it write?
[10:34] <roycebarber> Either WINE had better emulate every windows program, or someone should write programs that run on every os without recompiling it.
[10:35] <webben> roycebarber: I think they did. it's called Java.
[10:35] <sparr> roycebarber: what webben said
[10:35] <Kvark> how do you change language?
[10:35] <hintswen> ubuntu is gnome right?
[10:35] <sparr> hintswen: ish
[10:35] <ub12> Hello. Can some one please tell me how do i set a password for su?
[10:35] <webben> hintswen: Ubuntu Desktop comes with gnome installed
[10:35] <hintswen> ok, thanks
[10:35] <sparr> hintswen: by default, yes.  but ubuntu provides kde packages as well.  kubuntu has kde as the default.
[10:36] <sparr> xubuntu has xfce as the default
[10:36] <webben> hitswen: you can run Ubuntu without gnome, and you can install alternate wms like kde xfce fluxbox etc
[10:36] <roycebarber> Is gnome more stable than KDE
[10:36] <hintswen> I was just trying to work out the difference lo
[10:36] <ub12> Kvark you can choose language at the login window
[10:36] <eyequeue> !sudo > ub12
[10:36] <webben> roycebarber: who knows? (the best a question like that could do is start a flamewar ;) )
[10:36] <sparr> gnome is so far behind kde in terms of eye candy and features...  i cant imagine why there is still any competition...  except maybe for gtk+ being Free and Qt not.
[10:36] <CotRo|eR> !proftpd
[10:36] <ubotu> proftpd: Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.3.0-9 (edgy), package size 579 kB, installed size 1508 kB
[10:36] <ub12> eyequeue, I do not want to use sudo
[10:36] <CotRo|eR> i have set up proftpd on my ubuntu and when i acces it i cant write to it... how do i make it write?
[10:36] <Kvark> ub12 thanks i'll try that!
[10:37] <ub12> Kvark np
[10:37] <eyequeue> ub12, nevertheless, read the url the bot gave
[10:37] <webben> roycebarber: most of the gnome-kde fanboyism focuses not on stability but on "simplicity" vs "power"
[10:37] <ub12> eyequeue, ok thanks
[10:37] <eyequeue> ub12, it covers what you want, no doubt (-i)

[10:39] <roycebarber> I cant find my windows directory when im running ubuntu. will i have to stand on my head to make it work, because im new at this.
[10:39] <webben> roycebarber: you probably want to look into ntfs-3g
[10:39] <sparr> webben: plausible.  i have tried gnome a few times in the last few years, and what they call "simplicity" i call "limited to the features kde had 3 years ago"
[10:40] <edgy> Hi, i downloaded edgy iso and mounted -o looped it so I now have all the .debs files, can I upgrade dapper to edgy without burning the iso to a CD? something like dpkg -i *
[10:40] <roycebarber> If I find my Windows directory (by the way what is "ntfs-3g???"), will that make WINE run better?
[10:41] <eyequeue> edgy, out then in /var/cache/apt/archives, then run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (after editing sources.list etc)
[10:41] <eyequeue> edgy, put them
[10:41] <ub12> eyequeue, Thanks it gave me excactly the information I was after. I have been asked for su password when trying to set up a cups printer using "localhost:631" method but it would not accept my sudo pasword.
[10:41] <eyequeue> ub12, :)
[10:42] <edgy> eyequeue: thx a lot for the idea I will try now and report back if there is any problem
[10:42] <eyequeue> edgy, dpkg -i is too dangerous, apt will handle sequencing and dependencies
[10:42] <Juhaz> sparr, what you call "features" and "eye candy", I call endless clutter of ugly junk being puked on me whether I want it or not
[10:42] <eyequeue> edgy, are you fluent on sources.list and apt-get update?
[10:43] <roycebarber> When I plug in a USB hard drive, can i disconnect it at any time or do i need to somehow eject it first in the os????
[10:43] <samu2> ok, i managed to switch to a terminal and login with ctrl+alt+f2
[10:43] <sparr> Juhaz: meh, it can all be turned off in kde if you dont want it.  im not a fan of eye candy, but some of the basic things that i need in a GUI just arent there in gnome
[10:44] <samu2> then i switch back to gdm and try to login and get thrown out as usual... and then if i try to switch to terminal2 again the system crashes
[10:44] <sparr> Juhaz: take baobab, gnome finally has a graphical 'treeview' file browser (ish)...  comparable to the same utilities in windows 8 years ago, and kde 3 years ago.
[10:44] <jdawson> Can anyone recommend a good tut/doc on installing ubuntu next to linux on my laptop? I have two seperate partitions already, C (win) and D (nothing) -- just nervous about screwing my win partition, important stuff on there.
[10:44] <sparr> jdawson: ubuntu is linux...
[10:44] <jdawson> mistake, next to winxp :P
[10:44] <sparr> sure.  just install it on D
[10:45] <eyequeue> what is D?
[10:45] <jdawson> 'oh right, cool thanks
[10:45] <sparr> (nothing), apparently  :)
[10:45] <edgy> eyequeue: where should I find the .deb's file on the cd?! the pool/main and pool/restricted only contains 29 basic packages
[10:45] <roycebarber> jdawson ubuntu can safly adjust your partition automatically.. but please for pinaples sake buy a backup drive and backup your files first.
[10:45] <sparr> then you can set up the windows boot loader on C to give you a menu with D as an option, or you can install grub/lilo on the mbr or on C
[10:46] <eyequeue> edgy, pool would be where they reside, you may have the livecd which has less debs on it
[10:46] <jdawson> Righto thanks
[10:46] <samu2> yeah, backup files first if you have anything impoo

[10:46] <CotRo|eR> i have an ubuntu ftp server and when i try to upload it says permission denied.... any help???

[10:46] <edgy> eyequeue: i dowloaded the ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[10:47] <CotRo|eR> sparr: how do i make write persmission pls?
[10:47] <eyequeue> edgy, yes, "desktop" is the livecd (as opposed to alternate, which i prefer)
[10:47] <roycebarber> My boot loader says im using an old version of Ubuntu, but i know im using 6.10. is my boot loader out of date, is that possible.
[10:47] <edgy> eyequeue: no one told me this before! ;)
[10:47] <eyequeue> roycebarber, which boot loader?  grub?
[10:48] <edgy> eyequeue: so desktop is the livecd and alternate is the desktop cd or what?!
[10:48] <samu2> are there any changes to gnome in 6.10 that might be incompatible with older hardware?
[10:48] <roycebarber> eyeque, im not sure what bootloader i use, it came with ubuntu 6.06 i believe, and it still thinks thats what os i use.
[10:48] <sparr> roycebarber: the boot loader configuration doesnt technically have anything to do with your actual ubuntu version, you could put Ubuntu 17.35 in your menu.lst if you wanted
[10:49] <roycebarber> haha
[10:49] <eyequeue> edgy, look on the cd download page of your favorite mirror for descriptions of "desktop" "alternate" and "server" isos

[10:49] <NineTeen67Comet> Little question about dual monitors and games .. Is there a way to kick the game down to just one? They keep centering on the split between monitors and it makes it hard to exit the game let alone play it .. Help?
[10:49] <Xteven> I have an ubuntu 6.06 that keeps crashing on me, for no apparent reason :(
[10:49] <eyequeue> edgy, "desktop" is basically filled up with all that live stuff, so no room for many debs really.  alternate has the power :)
[10:50] <roycebarber> I cant move my GMAIL Notifier icon when the program is running. It likes to live in the top right of my screen. anyone know how to move it?
[10:50] <edgy> eyequeue: ok thx I got it now
[10:51] <eyequeue> edgy, good luck :)
[10:51] <roycebarber> Anyone have an answer for NineTeen67Comet? I'm afraide that might happen to me.
[10:52] <Xteven> when a sata disk shows errors in smartctl, could that be a reason why it hangs sometimes ? because it hung up without extra errors in smartctl too
[10:53] <roycebarber> Do I ever need to run Defrag in Linux? I had to run it in windows all the time.
[10:53] <FRET> good morning
[10:53] <samu2> i noticed another strange thing... the top 3 rows of the character '6' are missing when i am in a textmode terminal...
[10:54] <eyequeue> roycebarber, what is it?
[10:55] <rc-1> my bios screen/splash screen are all messed up, and other video errors too, (also in windows) do you think i need a new graphics card?
[10:55] <samu2> What's the main package for xfce?
[10:56] <Wizardling> Does the new version of Ubuntu finally work on old CRT iMacs without workarounds?
[10:56] <roycebarber> Eyeqye, defrag is a windows program that organizes the files on the hard drive so they can be accessed faster. im not entirly sure how it does it, i think it simply puts the files near the center of the circular hard drive platter, so they read quicker. i dont know if linux has Defragmentation, so i guess i'll have to look around.
[10:57] <enquest> Has anybody run into a bug, with 6.06 lts. The date changed today from 1 nov to 01 jan 2001 2 o'clock
[10:57] <eyequeue> roycebarber, common linux filesystems have no need for defragmenting
[10:57] <eyequeue> roycebarber, ext3 for example
[10:59] <Cyron> roycebarber, it does it by making sure all the bits of a given file are physically located beside each other on the hard drive so it can read it in one sweep of the head over the platter

[11:03] <Juhaz> sparr, baobab is hardly the first gnome disk space usage analyzer ever. gdmap for example is as old as kdirstat (~5 years), big deal if something has official flag.
[11:04] <Whoopie_> eyequeue: thanks, I found his repo before. but I can't find a package to install falcon to setup an own repo.

[11:18] <eyequeue> dd (1)               - convert and copy a file
[11:18] <eyequeue> dd (1posix)          - convert and copy a file
[11:18] <sparr> dd the cdrom drive device to a file
[11:18] <jpjacobs> thx apokryphos
[11:19] <sparr> .iso == image of ISO9660 filesystem
[11:20] <HeathenDan> dd is command line? does it have man?
[11:20] <sparr> yes.  yes.
[11:20] <HeathenDan> ok, lemme go read it then
[11:20] <sparr> dd if=/dev/cdrom of=something.iso
[11:20] <sparr> that should work, dont think you need any other options for a plain iso image
[11:21] <HeathenDan> alrighty, thx
[11:22] <johnema> hi
[11:22] <HeathenDan> hmm, does it have verbose mode?
[11:22] <johnema> do you have a rich sources.list for ubuntu edgy ??

[11:55] <smoenux> Hey everyone ^.^
[11:55] <kzm> Hmm...upgrading problem: trying to go from breezy to edgy (yeah, I know).  /sbin/vol_id was previously owned by udev, in edgy it belongs to volumeid.
[11:55] <kzm> So that blocks the upgrade of volumeid, and thus the whole process.
[11:55] <kzm> Any way around this?
[11:55] <smoenux> kzm: I heard it's a bad Idea to upgrade by skipping versions
[11:56] <eyequeue> kzm, breezy to edgy isn't supported, breezy to dapper to edgy
[11:56] <amayera> hi
[11:56] <kzm> Hmm...okay, I guess I can go via dapper, then.
[11:56] <smoenux> kzm: as eyeque says :P
[11:56] <amayera> I am using the latest ubuntu edgy. when I send my system into suspend2ram and it wakes up sometimes the mouse does just blink but not work (optical mouse). dmesg says that it is being disconnected and connected all the time.
[11:56] <Lynoure> smoenux: what about between LTS versions? Or from LTS to shorter term support version later on?
[11:57] <gilnim> good morning
[11:57] <edgy> eyequeue: why jumping a version matters? shouldn't just installing a new package replace the older irrespective of how old it is?
[11:57] <Lynoure> Seems a bit annoying if there will be no way to upgrade to the next LTS.
[11:57] <smoenux> Lynoure; hmmm.. I actually have no Idea.. I just read on the forums that you shouldn't skip versions when upgrading
[11:57] <Lynoure> edgy: upgrade needs to deal with configuration files, too.
[11:58] <kzm> edgy: the problem is that files are moved between packages.
[11:58] <kzm> edgy: presumably, this must be handled on a case-by-case basis.
[11:58] <smoenux> personally I just downloaded the image, and installed a completely new Edgy from scratch... havent had any problems at all
[11:58] <edgy> Lynoure: so it would upgrade but you may lose your configuration?
[11:59] <Lynoure> edgy: it's not that simple
[11:59] <eyequeue> edgy, no, there's a lot more than just package versions involved.  for example, edgy no longer uses sysvinit, and the sysvinit->upstart upgrade path is very fragile, scott only wrote it for cery specific known situations, not for any possible combination
[11:59] <eyequeue> s/cery/very/
[11:59] <kzm> Remove the running kernel image (not recommended) [No] ?
[12:00] <gilnim> Everytime I startup gnome my "space"-key doesn't work. I have to go to keyboard preferences and must choose another kind of keyboard driver. then i take the old keyboard driver for my standard keyboard and space-key works again.

[12:00] <ubotu> To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid"
[12:00] <edgy> eyequeue: so why upstart won't just remove sysvinit altogether and install itself? (sorry if it's silly question but still I didn't get it)
[12:00] <eyequeue> Lynoure, i suspect by dapper+10, lts->newlts will be addressed, heh
[12:01] <eyequeue> edgy, again, it's not that simple, you need to have a ton of little steps done in the interim, in a very specific order
[12:01] <eyequeue> edgy, any one of them breaks, your system won't boot, and you most likely ill have no clue how to repair
[12:02] <gilnim> another question: is there an official driver how-to for fglrx drivers in edgy?
[12:02] <eyequeue> edgy, are you, as implied, on edgy now?  cat /etc/fstab and see how different it looks from in dapper, as one example
[12:03] <gilnim> !edgy

[12:10] <chad> i have a Problem using Physical (raw) disk - Linux host - XP Guest ... im getting a bluescreen, when trying to start winxp.. i suspect it is a hd driver issue..  in vmware it says the disk is IDE ..but the disk is really a sata.. i get as far as the "winxo is starting up, logo"
[12:10] <eyequeue> maxb_at_work, something to try, no guarantees if it will help
[12:10] <gilnim> for ati there are several: aticontrol, fireglcontrol, ...
[12:10] <Bonez56> hi all. i have an edgy server install cd, and an IBM eServer x300 series server. It will not detect my network card, it's a gigabit NIC of some sort. Does anyone know what I can do or where I can get drivers?
[12:10] <gilnim> but i don't have a intel card
[12:10] <maxb_at_work> apt debugging reports "Package upstart has broken dep on sysvinit"
[12:10] <eyequeue> maxb_at_work, sudo apt-get install upstart ... see what it suggests, don't say yes unless you agree
[12:10] <cyzie> Tmob, dpkg-reconfigure for what?!
[12:10] <maxb_at_work> "upstart is already the newest version."
[12:11] <mirak> hi
[12:11] <eyequeue> maxb_at_work, sudo apt-get --reinstall install upstart
[12:11] <Tmob> cyzie, its to reconfigure ur package
[12:11] <cyzie> Tmob, there is NOTHING to reconfigure for vino.............
[12:11] <ubunub> is there any way i can get my su password? i dont even remember setting one, and i've installed ubuntu just yesterday
[12:11] <mirak> my boot sequence stalls and after a moment says it can't mount /dev/mapper/mylinuxroot
[12:11] <Bonez56> anyone know how I can get Ubuntu to detect my network card?
[12:11] <Tmob> cyzie, if u actually want to edit the vino settings.. then u hvae to refer to program man i guess
[12:11] <Tmob> since i never used vino :)
[12:12] <eyequeue> maxb_at_work, wait, when was your last sudo apt-get update?  could you perhaps not have the current Packages.gz?
[12:12] <cyzie> Tmob, there is no man vino :(
[12:12] <Tmob> ubunub, u dont have a root account
[12:12] <gilnim> Bonez56: Search google for NIC go to products and search yours - maybe the have drivers. At least you could find out the name of your card and then ask google for linux drivers.
[12:12] <ubunub> so i cant update nothing?
[12:12] <Tmob> ubunub, you just type ur local user pass when u sudo
[12:12] <Bonez56> gilnim, the IBM site only has drivers for a 2.4 kernel
[12:12] <eyequeue> !root > ubunub
[12:12] <fnf> ubunub: I don't need to restore your password, just boot into single mode and reset it.
[12:12] <mirak> help
[12:12] <gilnim> Bonez56: What about the WWW?
[12:12] <eyequeue> fnf, bad advice and not advised, /msg ubotu root
[12:13] <Bonez56> gilnim, i can not find anything. i did end up getting the 2.4 driver but i don't know what to do with it. how do i load it into the ubuntu setup process?
[12:13] <ubunub> mh ok, so i can update ubuntu with sudo pw?
[12:13] <gilnim> another question: is there a driver how-to for official fglrx drivers in edgy?
[12:13] <eyequeue> fnf, ubuntu handles security differently from other distros :)
[12:14] <eyequeue> ubunub, read the url the bot gave you, setting a root password is NOT advised in ubuntu
[12:14] <gilnim> Bonez56: what kind of package do you have?
[12:14] <maxb_at_work> eyequeue: No, I'm fully up-to-date with gb.archive.ubuntu.org.   Haven't tried the --reinstall yet... I'm a bit reluctant to, as I can't really see how that's going to change anything.
[12:14] <fnf> eyequeue: I'm running Edgy Server, but I though his problem was he forgot his password. Perhaps.
[12:14] <eyequeue> ubunub, sudo apt-get install packagename, then your user password, is an example command :)
[12:15] <Bonez56> gilnim, it's just a file without an extention
[12:15] <Bonez56> gilnim, it's not a package
[12:15] <ubunub> ow tnx guys, going thru that bot link
[12:15] <eyequeue> maxb_at_work, yeah, the dependency error gave me the idea it could be an "ealry-upstart-version" issue, but i guess not
[12:15] <gilnim> oh ...
[12:16] <gilnim> Bonez56: sorry can't help you with that
[12:16] <Mondoshawan> hi all

[12:27] <abze> have no idea how that happend, first time
[12:28] <mamzers555> abze; what do you mean with root-permission?
[12:28] <abze> it can only start when ur root
[12:28] <hintswen> cyaz, time to install linux
[12:28] <abze> i think :S
[12:29] <mamzers555> abze; what happens if you start it in terminal, what output do you get?
[12:29] <abze> it wont start playing, and i think it gott installed only for root, and not user like me
[12:30] <abze> im sorry im new to this
[12:30] <sioux> hi ubuntus :-)
[12:30] <bronze> " beep media player only have root permisson" --> "only root has execute permission on  beep media"
[12:30] <abze> i tryde beep in terminal, and nothing happens
[12:30] <chad> i have a Problem using Physical (raw) disk - Linux host - XP Guest ... im getting a bluescreen, when trying to start winxp.. i suspect it is a hd driver issue..  in vmware it says the disk is IDE ..but the disk is really a sata.. i get as far as the "winxo is starting up, logo"
[12:30] <sioux> do i wrong or on dapper was a gnome gui to mount fat disk?
[12:31] <jdawson> Hello, I have followed a tut and mounted my windows drive (sda1) to /dev/win ... all fine, I can see it and if I sudo in the console I can list it's structure. However, it's read-only and I can't access it from the GUI/gnome interface. I've tried chown and etc.
[12:31] <mamzers555> bronze; maybe you can help him, i don't know much about beep media player
[12:31] <protocol1> how do I go about upgrading from dapper to edgy?
[12:31] <protocol1> is there a console command I can use?
[12:32] <SupremacyGnu> abze, try to reinstall it but this time not as root
[12:32] <sioux> protocol see the topic but I do not reccomend!
[12:32] <usamahashimi> hi all
[12:32] <mirak> help me
[12:32] <abze> do i use sudo apt-get install beep?
[12:32] <mirak> plz
[12:32] <usamahashimi> how can i install ubuntu in nokia 6610?
[12:32] <Vorbote> protocol1: sudo sh -c "update-manager -c"
[12:33] <alek> hello, which command removes program from autorun (init.d) ?
[12:33] <dom_f> Hi.  I upgraded to Edgy a few days back and just noticed that my root filesystem is not showing up in either df or mount - could someone else running edgy jsee if they are seeing the same behaviour?
[12:33] <protocol1> Vorbote, thank you
[12:33] <abze> didnt work that either :S
[12:34] <abze> like xmms very much, and would like to check out beep :P
[12:34] <defrysk> beep-media-player
[12:34] <richee> hey hpnadig_
[12:35] <Vorbote> protocol1: yes, do read the pages mentiones in the /topic
[12:35] <Vorbote> though...
[12:36] <jdawson> Hello, I have followed a tut and mounted my windows drive (sda1) to /dev/win ... all fine, I can see it and if I sudo in the console I can list it's structure. However, it's read-only and I can't access it from the GUI/gnome interface. I've tried chown and  chmod but little luck, not googling much help either. thanks.
[12:36] <hpnadig_> hi richee
[12:36] <abze> hi thatnx mate, beeb-media-player helped :P
[12:36] <abze> so what is beep then, because it gott installed hehe
[12:36] <Vorbote> !ntfs-3g
[12:36] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[12:36] <abze> thought it was the player
[12:36] <dom_f> Has anyone running edgy got one minute to check something for me?
[12:37] <wouaren> yes
[12:37] <jdawson> ubotu: is that the best/only way? as I don't need write, I just want to read the structure through gnome explorer -- (I remember being able to do this in fedora no probs) .. thanks
[12:37] <dom_f> wouaren: I upgraded to Edgy a few days back and just noticed that my root filesystem is not showing up in either df or mount - could you check to see if you  are seeing the same behaviour?
[12:37] <Vorbote> jdawson: ubotu is a bot, and yes, it is the only way.
[12:37] <jdawson> oh lol
[12:38] <nothlit> Vorbote, ubuntu doesn't have captiventfs support?
[12:38] <defrysk> !ubotu
[12:38] <wouaren> no i see /root
[12:38] <salim> hi, I have used a patch to the kernel, but I want to use the old kernel again, I can boot in grub in it, but I want the old one to be the standard, how can I do that?
[12:38] <dom_f> Thanks
[12:38] <wouaren> someone now the console command to switch to en language when you are in fr,it etc.. ?
[12:38] <wouaren> know
[12:38] <Cyron> Edgy does hide a bunch of folders by default
[12:39] <mamzers555> abze; if you enter in terminal beep --help or man beep then you will know what it is
[12:39] <Vorbote> nothlit: no, and to be frank, it better not. Captive is a hack for 2.4 kernels and the forward port to 2.6 is, err, defective.
[12:39] <mamzers555> abze; if you enter in terminal "beep --help" or "man beep" then you will know what it is
[12:39] <Cyron> sudo kate /.hidden and you can edit the folders that are visible
[12:39] <Cyron> Or you can delete .hidden altogether
[12:39] <Cyron> That might solve it for you
[12:39] <abze> mamzers thanx will try that
[12:40] <Mr_Pan> hi
[12:40] <Mr_Pan> i have a problem with upgrade to 6.10. apt give me an error code (1) processing xfonts-intl-european_1.2.1-6 . any idea?
[12:40] <abze> like the beep media player :D
[12:40] <abze> love linux, who needs vista!
[12:40] <alek> vista sux:P
[12:40] <dom_f> OK - my root file system is not showing up in df or mount but is obviouslty mounted!   Does nayone have any suggestions about how I start to troubleshoot this?  I've sepnt some time googling but to no avail.
[12:40] <nothlit> Cyron, i don't see a .hidden.. but this is a 6.10 beta install
[12:41] <alek> hungryyy
[12:41] <alek> where can I find the list of commands in ubuntu?
[12:41] <Cyron> It's under /
[12:41] <mamzers555> alek; which commands?
[12:41] <alek> any
[12:41] <alek> all commands
[12:41] <KusKusso> hi all!
[12:42] <nothlit> Cyron, sudo ls /.hidden | ls: /.hidden: No such file or directory
[12:42] <mamzers555> alek; in terminal press "tabulator-key" twice
[12:42] <Vorbote> dom_f: do a "sudo vol_id -u /dev/<root partition>" and make sure it matches the UUID in /etc/fstab for tour root partition.
[12:42] <alek> because I often want to do sth and I dont know which command do it
[12:42] <Vorbote> dom_f: make sure as well that /etc/mtab exists and it is readable.
[12:42] <webben> alek: Google is your best friend here
[12:42] <webben> alek: and us of course ;)
[12:43] <alek> yes i was looking through google but I didnt find anything
[12:43] <alek> :(
[12:43] <Cyron> Sorry nothlit, I'm done for ideas then :)
[12:43] <webben> alek: no, i mean, for the individual things you want to do
[12:43] <mamzers555> alek; this is very good for you i think: http://www.ss64.com/bash/index.html
[12:43] <alek> cause I want to remove program prom init.d
[12:43] <webben> not for a list of all the commands
[12:43] <alek> great!
[12:43] <webben> alek: what program?
[12:44] <nothlit> Cyron, I don't think i have anything hidden anyways :)
[12:44] <alek> I added my own program to list of program which are running during linux-botting but i dont remember the name of this command
[12:44] <alek> cause I want to remove this program
[12:45] <alek> list of programs*
[12:45] <mirak> hi
[12:45] <webben> alek: well what did your own program /do/?
[12:46] <alek> it doesnt matter:P
[12:46] <dom_f> Vorbote:  the UUID from vol_id matches /etc/fstab and /etc/mtab existss and is readable - however mtab does not contacin an entry for root
[12:46] <kaflan> hellow. how to make kdesu prompt for root password instead of the password of the invoking user? (i totally do sudo passwd root, and patch /etc/sudoers with rootpw argument).
[12:46] <mirak> for an install over lvm do I need a server iso or a desktop iso ?
[12:46] <webben> alek: I'm asking because it does matter, obviously.
[12:46] <drowstar> I have installed ubuntu-desktop on a fresh _K_ubuntu edgy installation and gtk2-themes don't work (I get solid grey squares instead of buttons for example). any hints?
[12:46] <drowstar> kaflan: kdesu
[12:46] <alek> I remember I used some command to add program to "autorun". and now I want to remove it
[12:46] <sioux> How can I mount my fat disk on edgy? dappar had a gnome gui to do it!
[12:47] <jdawson> Cool that worked, thanks
[12:47] <drowstar> kaflan: sorry, pressed send to soon :)
[12:47] <kaflan> dowstar: np
[12:47] <oceanis> i want o install games on dapper but from the cd..?
[12:47] <alek> I  had copied this program to /etc/init.d and used some command to add this progam to the 'autorun list'
[12:48] <webben> alek: you could start by having a look at System -> Administration -> Services in Gnome
[12:48] <alek> I hadnt X
[12:48] <eyequeue> alek, sudo update-rc.d?
[12:48] <drowstar> kaflan: afaik sudo is meant to work that way. kdesu on ubuntu is patched to use sudo. for not too long there has been native support for sudo in kdesu, not sure if thats a compile time flag or an option though
[12:48] <webben> alek: oh
[12:48] <alek> wroc!
[12:48] <alek> I havent X
[12:48] <alek> ubuntu-server
[12:48] <phanter> hello there. I installed LVM2 yesterday and all seemed well, but when I check the sizes then vgdisplay says it is 104 gig, and after mounting df says id is 49 gig. Why is there that huge differnce
[12:48] <nothlit> alek, update-rc.d ?
[12:48] <alek> YES
[12:48] <webben> alek: yeah update-rc.d is what you want
[12:49] <alek> this is what I wanted to know:] 
[12:49] <drowstar> kaflan: meaning: i dont think thats possible using a standard ubuntu installation
[12:49] <salim> hello?
[12:49] <mirak> for an install over lvm do I need a server iso or a desktop iso ?
[12:49] <mirak> for an install over lvm do I need a server iso or a desktop iso ?
[12:49] <eyequeue> alek, man update-rc.d, you want to remove the start links (you can rm the stop links next week, heh)
[12:49] <mirak> my system is already partitioned
[12:49] <sioux> how can I mount to my edgy a fat disk?
[12:49] <phanter> mirak: can do both
[12:50] <Vorbote> dom_f: that's strange.... Try changing the UUID for the device and check at next reboot.
[12:50] <eyequeue> alek, ls -lrt /etc/init.d/ | tail
[12:50] <noelferreira> what is the best xgl cobination for edgy?
[12:50] <kaflan> drowstar: but why in manual developers write about sudo passwd root and /etc/sudoers commands?
[12:50] <eyequeue> alek, yours is probably last of the 10
[12:50] <noelferreira> beryl , compiz?
[12:50] <mirak> phanter: so with the live cd I can install on my already LVM partitioned hard drive ?
[12:50] <phanter> noelferreira: I was very happy with beryl
[12:50] <noelferreira> was?
[12:50] <noelferreira> not anymore?
[12:50] <dom_f> Thanks Vorbote.  WIll do but not now as I've something running I don't want to stop.
[12:51] <phanter> mirak: you should be able to. I never tried but the options are in the setup
[12:51] <drowstar> kaflan: hum, not sure. give me a second, I'll try to get up to speed on sudoers real quick :)
[12:51] <mirak> phanter: thank you, my bandwith is not very fast
[12:51] <kaflan> drowstar: couse i will wait :) thx for helping
[12:51] <mirak> phanter: my problem is I can't boot 2.6.17-10
[12:51] <phanter> mirak: do you have experience with lvm?
[12:51] <mirak> it fails
[12:51] <sioux> which tool I have to use to mount fat disk?
[12:52] <kevb> Can anyone guide me through installing vino from edgy-proposed?
[12:52] <mirak> phanter: yes, my partition is already lvm
[12:52] <phanter> mirak: is you base system installed on a lvm partition?
[12:52] <mamzers555> sioux; you have to do it in the terminal
[12:52] <sioux> mamzers dapper had a tool in gome!
[12:52] <noelferreira> people anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy?
[12:52] <cyzie> hwo do i share printer across windows/linux network?
[12:53] <phanter> mirak: I have a huge difference between my vgdisplay disk sice (100gig) and my df disk size (49gig). Do you know how this is possible?
[12:53] <eyequeue> kevb, if you have the .deb, sudo dpkg -i vino*.deb
[12:53] <kevb> eyequeue: I don't have the .deb, i don't know how to get it : )
[12:54] <mamzers555> sioux; i think it is gone in edgy
[12:54] <eyequeue> kevb, is -proposed in sources.list?
[12:54] <chad> i have a Problem using Physical (raw) disk - Linux host - XP Guest ... im getting a bluescreen, when trying to start winxp.. i suspect it is a hd driver issue..  in vmware it says the disk is IDE ..but the disk is really a sata.. i get as far as the "winxo is starting up, logo"
[12:54] <phanter> mirak: did you by accident see this website already (has lot of info, but is not always very clear)? http://deb.riseup.net/storage/lvm2/
[12:54] <mirak> phanter: no.
[12:54] <sioux> mammers it is but do you remember the mane of that package?
[12:54] <mirak> phanter: in fact yes.
[12:54] <kevb> eyequeue: I added proposed to the end of "... edgy main restricted..."
[12:54] <eyequeue> kevb, i have not used -proposed myself, but if so, i would imagine you would just sudo apt-get install vino
[12:54] <kevb> eyequeue: in sources.list
[12:54] <mirak> phanter: maybe you didn't included all the logical volumes you created
[12:55] <phanter> mirak: then it should not show up like that in vgdisplay (i think)... but not sure
[12:55] <eyequeue> kevb, wait, i think you have an error in syntax there, let me clarify
[12:55] <kevb> eyequeue: when i did apt-get update it failed on proposed, i'm not sure it exists
[12:55] <eyequeue> kevb, okay, cool, error confirmed :)
[12:55] <kevb> eyequeue: "deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy main restricted universe multiverse proposed"
=== user-land3 is now known as user-land
[12:56] <eyequeue> kevb, revert to your former sources.list, you had an "edgy main..." line, right?
[12:56] <kevb> eyequeue: yeah
[12:56] <eyequeue> kevb, take off proposed, then sudo apt-get update, to confirm the file is good at that point
[12:56] <phanter> oke, i see. lvm tells me that: "Alloc PE / Size       12401 / 48.44 GB", but I did not yet use any of the space. How is that possible?
[12:56] <kevb> eyequeue: it is, it actually failed on proposed
[12:57] <kevb> eyequeue: Unable to find expected entry  proposed/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file
[12:57] <eyequeue> kevb, then *duplicate* that entire line, and turn "edgy" into "edgy-proposed"
[12:57] <kevb> eyequeue: ahhhhh : )
[12:57] <webben> I asked this earlier, so please excuse the repeat, but has anyone tried running Ubuntu in Parallels?
[12:57] <mirak> phanter: hum my lvm tools whee uninstalled ...
[12:57] <eyequeue> kevb, the original line should *not* have proposed at the end, just so i'm clear about that
[12:58] <kevb> eyequeue: yup, kk, testing
[12:58] <eyequeue> kevb, sudo apt-get update, to confirm the file is good at that point
[12:58] <mamzers555> sioux; no, btw, you can write the name of somebody if you write the first 2 letters and then press tab (in xchat)
[12:58] <phanter> mirak: try the command: vgscan
[12:58] <maxb_at_work> Gaaah! Finally figured it out. I had (deliberately) retained the dapper sources in /etc/apt/sources.list. That was the source of the dist-upgrade malfunction.
[12:58] <kevb> eyequeue: It's good and your a hero : ) Let me see if I can install vino now
[12:58] <mamzers555> sioux; in my case write "mam" and press tab
[12:59] <drowstar> kaflan: alright: I am not a sudo expert, but from what I have gathered (and I have not found anything indicating the contrary) that is really and truely not possible :) since you need to have the root account enabled anyway you can use the "su" command to get root priviledges in a terminal. I dont think you can use kdesu for that though. could you explain where you found "but why in manual developers write about sudo passwd root and
[12:59] <drowstar> /etc/sudoers commands" as you wrote earlier?
[12:59] <wouaren> hi, i have a prob, i want a double access in /var/www, i added user y to group x wich is the group of /var/www, i want y to be able to create folders in /var/www but withouth changing name etc of current ones. so i made chmod 775 /var/www -R then chmod 755 /Var/www/protectedfolder -R. BUT PROBLEM : user y cna change the name of "protected folders" (but cant change files in them). What can i do to change this ? Thank you
[12:59] <dade`> someone using a macbook ?
[12:59] <drowstar> sorry to ask again guys, but I haven't been able to solve this problem with google: I have installed ubuntu-desktop on a fresh _K_ubuntu edgy installation and gtk2-themes don't work (I get solid grey squares instead of buttons for example). any hints?
[01:00] <kaflan> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo

[01:03] <wouaren> hi, i have a prob, i want a double access in /var/www, i added user y to group x wich is the group of /var/www, i want y to be able to create folders in /var/www but withouth changing name etc of current ones. so i made chmod 775 /var/www -R then chmod 755 /Var/www/protectedfolder -R. BUT PROBLEM : user y can change the name of "protected folders" (but cant change files in them). What can i do to change this ? Thank you No one for
[01:03] <wouaren> that ? Its a easy problem i guess

[01:04] <kevb> has anyone else managed to update/fix vino (Remote Desktop) in edgy yet?
[01:04] <phanter> mirak: what does it mean and what can I do
[01:04] <prism-user> i hate you Hobbsee!  Kicking me out because of my little brother
[01:04] <prism-user> bye
[01:04] <mirak> like I said you didn't used all your lvm extents for your logical partition
[01:04] <Hobbsee> hah
[01:05] <Hobbsee> like he had a legitimate purpose to be where he was anyway
[01:05] <phanter> mirak: oke, but how do I add it then (because i thought I had)
[01:05] <gnomefreak> not any more
[01:05] <Hobbsee> gnomefreak: heh
[01:05] <mirak> phanter: /dev/mapper/vg-datalvm  what is the file system of this partition ?
[01:05] <Hobbsee> gnomefreak: i wasnt goign to do that in here.  maybe let them back after a couple of days.
[01:05] <gnomefreak> he needs not bring drama in here for any reason
[01:06] <mirak> phanter: you must add size to this logical volume, then growth the filesystem to fit the new volume size.
[01:06] <Hobbsee> gnomefreak: true
[01:06] <phanter> mirak: i do not get it, please wait. how do I add the logical volume then?
[01:06] <mirak> phanter: look the doc or an howto, I don't remember the commands
[01:06] <mnepton> Hobbsee: i hate you for reasons entirely related to IRC. mostly having to do with Lego and bourbon.
[01:06] <mnepton> *unrelated
[01:06] <mirak> phanter: should read docs about how lvm works
[01:06] <richee> hpnadig_: are u able to login to ur server, its too slow
[01:06] <drowstar> kaflan: hm, my experiments dont really get me anywhere :) sorry, I dont think theres a way
[01:07] <richee> hpnadig_: are u facing the same problem?
[01:07] <Hobbsee> mnepton: hehe.  oh good :P
[01:07] <jason_> Before I ask my question here Is there a ubuntu-specific apache channel?
[01:07] <kaflan> drowstar: np, but, thx for helping.
[01:07] <mnepton> Hobbsee: *muah*
[01:08] <SupremacyGnu> I have a problem with my updatemanager. What do I do when I have a broken package which synaptic can't repair or remove? the package name is Freepats
[01:08] <mirak> phanter: you don't had a logical volume. you just need to extend the size of your /dev/mapper/vg-datalvm volume. until you get 0 PE free. then after that you must increase your file system size that is inside this partition.
[01:08] <richee> SupremacyGnu: apt-get -f install
[01:08] <kevb> Anyone know anything about vino (Remote Desktop) problem in edgy?
[01:09] <SupremacyGnu> richee, ah, thanks. Seems to work
[01:09] <richee> SupremacyGnu: great!!
[01:12] <SupremacyGnu> richee, nope. that didn't work either
[01:12] <jason_> I need to enable the DELETE method on apache, Reading the docs on /httpd.apache.org, I see that 'Limit' Directive is probably what Im looking for, But I can not find in the config files where this directive is at all. If I need to just add it, I need to know what File exactly It should be added to. apache2.conf, httpd.conf, envvars, or maybe something in the conf.d subdir?
[01:12] <kevb> Can't believe so few people are concerned about the vino issue
[01:13] <richee> SupremacyGnu: can't u plzz paste the output
[01:13] <richee> SupremacyGnu: *can

[01:19] <[ANF] MasterNinja> edgy is better though

[01:20] <jason_> Winball: anly way i know how to do that is, save my /home and just toss in a dapper cd and reinstalll
[01:20] <kevb> jamesstansell: I'm not sure, there is a bug fix somewhere for this: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/65795

[01:21] <klm-> the address that should look like this: 00-AA-00-61-91-6D
[01:22] <jamesstansell> kevb: maybe not on the mirrors yet?
[01:22] <richee> SupremacyGnu: try this sudo apt-get remove --purge freepats
[01:22] <kevb> jamesstansell: I tried the main archive.ubuntu.org
[01:22] <richee> SupremacyGnu: or whatever u gave to install it
[01:22] <jason_> klm-: type ifconfig in a terminal
[01:23] <klm-> jason_: thanks!
[01:23] <kevb> jamesstansell: I'm fairly sure i could edit the source myself, do you know of a guide that would show me how to uninstall a package then download and install from source (to modify it before hand)?
[01:25] <jonah1980> hi can anyone help me out with setting swiftfox as the default browser please?
[01:26] <SupremacyGnu> richee, hmm, I think I installed this when trying to install midi support with easyubuntu
[01:26] <jamesstansell> kevb: there are guides around for using apt-get source to download a source package, compile and install
[01:26] <jason_> kevb: something like apt-get build-dep package-name and apt-get --build source package-name, may be the commands your looking for.
[01:27] <jk_work> My Atheros wireless connections are much more jerky with Edgy
[01:27] <SupremacyGnu> richee, and it seems as if freepats is depending on the package timidity which I can't remove either
[01:27] <richee> SupremacyGnu: now does it work, that why I told u to do a ps aux | grep apt
[01:27] <jk_work> Did they change drivers?
[01:27] <jk_work> Can I change back?
[01:27] <SupremacyGnu> richee, nope. That didn't work
[01:27] <jamesstansell> kevb: but I'm not sure of an easy way like that when you need to update the source first
[01:27] <richee> SupremacyGnu: try a apt-get remove --purge timidity

[01:33] <pukeko> whats the version of netconfig called in dapper ?
[01:34] <jason_> kaflan: speaking strictly from an Nvidia perspective, because I dont have any ati cards, I'd suggest only installing drivers through apt. but that may be different for ati.
[01:34] <kaflan> jason_: how i can find ati drivers in apt?

[01:37] <cypher> so
[01:37] <gnomefreak> cypher: what are you talking about? k3b is still in kde. distrowatch is not a place i use or go to we have the packages we use no need for distrowatch
[01:38] <bigusdickus> puke: ifconfig
[01:38] <jason_> kaflan: hm well maybe not, it seems even on the ubuntuguide website they suggest using something else.

[01:38] <cypher> gnomefreak: distrowatch is agood place for learning about new distros

[01:40] <protocol1> good?
[01:40] <bigusdickus> protocol1, compare what exactly
[01:40] <kevb> jamesstansell: I have the source package and I made the change (i think)
[01:40] <bigusdickus> protocol1, yes is good.
[01:40] <protocol1> gui
[01:40] <gnomefreak> cypher: this is not the place for chat about distrowatch.
[01:40] <bigusdickus> gui is good too
[01:40] <protocol1> browsers
[01:40] <bigusdickus> browsers are very good and nice too
[01:40] <kevb> jamesstansell: Do I just do the usual ./configure; make; checkinstall?
[01:41] <cypher> protocol : dapper is spicial
[01:41] <cypher> is french
[01:41] <pukeko> bigus: i have 2 nics and it can only see one - however it did load the modules - for both - but ifconfig eth1 x.x.x.x up - gives no such device
[01:41] <cypher> 3 years of warrenty
[01:41] <cypher> i heared
[01:41] <cypher> free updates
[01:41] <protocol1> I know dapper is LTS
[01:41] <bigusdickus> puke: dmesg shows the card as detected if you reboot?
[01:41] <cypher> yeah did u read the book
[01:41] <jamesstansell> kevb: to make a dpkg file there are command like make-dpkg, but I'm not really familiar with them.
[01:42] <jason_> pukeko: what hjeppens when you run ifconfig with no arguments?
[01:42] <jamesstansell> kevb: I guess you could try ./configure and make to just see if the patch works for you
[01:42] <pukeko> dmesg has both

[01:44] <dcypherd> whats the problem
[01:44] <pukeko> i have tried a couple of cards - started with two the "same" same prob
[01:44] <mike_> R2D3: No, i've 386
[01:44] <bigusdickus> puke: maybe an interrupt conflict? you see one in /proc/interrupts?
[01:44] <jamesstansell> kevb: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU
[01:44] <lch> or can I change the xorg.conf before the installer tries to load the graphical console? because this hangs the system, seems to be a problem on nearly all Dell Optiplex systems
[01:44] <snikker> how can i join the binary files splitted with the split command?
[01:44] <jason_> R2D3: last time I tried flash on 64bit, Macromedia had no support for 64bit on linux. I had to use a 32bit chroot
[01:45] <bigusdickus> snikker, with cat
[01:45] <alek> in subversion, one repository can contains more than one projects? or i should have one repository for one projekt?
[01:45] <alek> project*
[01:45] <dcypherd> have you tried it as sudo
[01:45] <R2D3> Jason_: did it work for you?
[01:45] <lch> bigusdickus, I know there is a text based installer on the alternate install cd, but I want to know if I can do that with the standard install cd, too
[01:45] <mike_> yes tryed it as sudo and sudo su
[01:45] <jamesstansell> kevb: and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay
[01:45] <jason_> R2D3: with the 32bit chroot yes it worked, but thats a lot fo work just for one thing.
[01:45] <kevb> jamesstansell: Cheers
[01:45] <snikker> bigusdickus: but cat is not only for text files?
[01:46] <dcypherd> and you have already installed it
[01:46] <pukeko> only one in /proc/interrupts - bios has them at 10 and 11
[01:46] <bigusdickus> snikker, the cat documentation doesn't say such thing
[01:46] <mike_> Following guide at http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=183209&highlight=VMware+howto
[01:46] <jason_> R2D3: there are a lot of guides on the ubuntuforums on how to setup a 32bit environment
[01:46] <R2D3> Jason_: Do you know where can I find instructions to install the Flash plug-in on 64
[01:47] <kevb> jamesstansell: This is weird, it's missing dependecys when i ./configure, yet its install as a binary... : S
[01:47] <mike_> sudo /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl    but installation stops with Unable to get the access rights of source file "./vmware-vix/bin".
[01:47] <R2D3> jason_: I have 32bit environment already
[01:47] <bigusdickus> R2D3, one solution is to install it in a chroot, search in the ubuntu wiki for flash
[01:47] <snikker> bigusdickus: ah ok, thanks for help :)
[01:47] <bigusdickus> R2D3, if you have 32 bits already just install flashplugin-nonfree
[01:48] <jason_> R2D3: just install firefox and the flash plugin from within the chroot, and then run it from there.
[01:49] <R2D3> Jason_: When I tried to get flash I get this message:
[01:49] <R2D3> Reading package lists... Done
[01:49] <R2D3> Building dependency tree
[01:49] <R2D3> Reading state information... Done
[01:49] <R2D3> Package flashplugin-nonfree is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[01:49] <R2D3> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[01:49] <R2D3> is only available from another source
[01:49] <R2D3> E: Package flashplugin-nonfree has no installation candidate
[01:49] <dcypherd> well and it cant be a permissions problem cuz sudo would've fixed that
[01:49] <dcypherd> have you tried a reinstalll
[01:49] <bigusdickus> R2D3, you have just the wrong repositories in your sources.list
[01:49] <jamesstansell> kevb: I understand missing dependencies but I'm not sure what you meant about the install as a binary
[01:50] <dcypherd> i dunno
[01:50] <bigusdickus> R2D3, you need the MULTIVERSE REPOSITORIES!
[01:50] <R2D3> bigusdickus: Thank you. I'll check it now.
[01:50] <jason_> R2D3: you will need to enable the correct repositories. http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Repositories
[01:51] <dcypherd> R2D3: just download automatix
[01:51] <kevb> jamesstansell: well vino is installed already as part of ubuntu, as a binary. So surely it should have all of it's deps installed already..
[01:51] <bigusdickus> dcypherd, automatix is a very bad idea
[01:51] <dcypherd> haha
[01:51] <jason_> R2D3: Also (I could be wrong) but I think the chroot environment had its own sources.list
[01:51] <jamesstansell> kevb: not usually the parts needed to recompile it
[01:51] <dcypherd> for noobs its fine
[01:51] <jason_> maybe not its been a while
[01:51] <bigusdickus> dcypherd, maybe for noobs but not for your computer
[01:52] <bigusdickus> dcypherd, automatix uses --force-yes all over the place, is just crap
[01:52] <jamesstansell> kevb: I'd recommend uninstalling the ubuntu vino package before trying to compile the patch.  Less likelihood of them interfering with each other
[01:52] <dcypherd> haha so you would rather him hack his soucres.list himself
[01:52] <kevb> jamesstansell: kk, will do
[01:52] <R2D3> jason -  bigusdickus: I'm checking. I will let you know what the problems was if I can install the Flash player in my 64bit system
[01:53] <bigusdickus> dcypherd, yes. And changing a configuration file is no "hack". Is trivial.
[01:53] <lorizzo> hello
[01:53] <bigusdickus> R2D3, ok, good look!
[01:53] <bigusdickus> I mean luck :)
[01:53] <kevb> jamesstansell: oh crap, it wants to uninstall ubuntu-dektop when i do apt-get remove vino
[01:53] <kevb> jamesstansell: that can't be good?
[01:53] <bigusdickus> kevb, no problem
[01:53] <bigusdickus> kevb, you can uninstall ubuntu-desktop
[01:53] <jamesstansell> kevb: something like apt-get -d source vino should download the missing dependencies. Once you know what they are you can install them
[01:53] <kevb> ah ok thnx
[01:54] <dcypherd> sorry i forgot about the purists
[01:54] <jason_> dcypherd: I would rather anyone learn how to modify a plain-text file and take the risk of making errors, and learn the importance of making backups, than having them cluelessly use software that messes up their machine.
[01:54] <dcypherd> yeah yeah i see your point
[01:54] <hype> hi there
[01:54] <jamesstansell> kevb: it won't hurt to remove ubuntu-desktop, but you'll want to reinstall it when everything is working again, so it will be there when you upgrade to feisty
[01:55] <rc-1>  is there an irc command to query channels (based on popularity etc?)
[01:55] <bigusdickus> rc-1, in x-chat: Window->Channel List
[01:56] <bigusdickus> rc-1, no popularity contest among irc channels though
[01:56] <tortho> anyone who knows an easy way to apply a patch to the kernel (i have some diff and i'm a newbie to this)
[01:56] <bigusdickus> tortho, gzip -cd ../patch-2.6.18.1.gz | patch -p1
=== user-land2 is now known as user-land
[01:57] <kevb> jamesstansell: apt-get -d source vino just got vino again, no dependencies :S
[01:57] <tortho> bigusdickus: is this how i can apply the diff text to my kernel?
[01:58] <jamesstansell> kevb: I must have been wrong about it
[01:58] <jason_> So does anyone know where in the apache2 config files I can enable the DELETE method? In the ubuntu apache package it is disabled by default and I cant find where to enable it.
[01:58] <kevb> jamesstansell: Ah, i think it's -b switch
[01:58] <kevb> jamesstansell: for "build-dependencies"
[01:58] <bigusdickus> tortho, yes if your diff is compressed and you have it stored in one directory above the directory with your sources
[01:58] <hype> how can i be sure of the graphic chipset of a pc? ( a friend of mineis installing Beryl but hedoenst know what graphic card he has)
[01:59] <kevb> jamesstansell: although it failed to get them : )
[01:59] <jason_> hype: use lspci
[01:59] <bigusdickus> tortho, if you have a non-compressed patch you don't need the gzip part and the pipe
[01:59] <tortho> bigusdickus: and then i have to make some config and compile a new kernel?
[01:59] <jamesstansell> kevb: did it at least list them?
[01:59] <hype> jason_ ,here is the output
=== byon is now known as deeem
[01:59] <hype> VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)
[01:59] <jason_> dont paste it here
[01:59] <hype> how cani know if its i910 or anything else?
[01:59] <hype> sorry
[01:59] <bigusdickus> tortho, you must be sure first the patch applies cleanly without rejects, you can do a make oldconfig and compile the new kernel
[02:00] <jason_> where do we paste output, i forget the channel name
[02:00] <johnema> i'm searching a sources.list with a lot of repository for Ubuntu Edgy (like a Trevino's sources.list)---- the google search has no important results
[02:00] <kevb> jamesstansell: Yeah, it listed them. Do I need to get them all as source?
[02:00] <tortho> bigusdickus: what i want to do is to add the patches for the p990i from this bug.. https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/62469
[02:00] <hype> jason_ http://www.rafb.net/paste/
[02:01] <jason_> ah ok
[02:01] <jamesstansell> kevb: you probably don't need their source - just a regular install of them should do
[02:01] <hype> any one can help me determine if my buddy is using i915 or i810?
[02:01] <jason_> hype: I just see an empty form though
[02:02] <jason_> oh recent pastes
[02:02] <bigusdickus> tortho, be advised those patches are for the vanilla kernel, so it could be it doesn't applies cleanly with patch but i see the patch is small enough you can merge it if needed
[02:02] <hype> jason_ , lol, i just pasted the revelent part of lspci from my mate
[02:02] <tortho> bigusdickus: thanks, will try to break something :-)
[02:02] <johnema> do you have a sources.list with a lot of repository for Ubuntu Edgy (like a Trevino's sources.list) ??
[02:03] <MetaMorfoziS> how can i idnetify my ram's speed?
[02:03] <hype> jason_ http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/ZotmYt39.html , ifyou want (one line tho)
[02:03] <alek> how to copy my files to svnrepository svn add or svn import?:(
[02:03] <hype> alek , you've setup your onw repo? :)
[02:03] <miranda82> hi people
[02:03] <jason_> hype: well looks like you found it then
[02:03] <_jordi> hi
[02:03] <alek> hype: jest
[02:04] <alek> wr
[02:04] <kevu> is rc.local executed after gnome is loaded?
[02:04] <miranda82> is there any command to check what speed is actually working my cpu?
[02:04] <alek> hype: yes
[02:04] <alek> Ive got repo in /var/www/framework and I want to copy files from /home/alek/framework to my repository
[02:04] <hype> jason_ , the thing is: i need to enagle 3D on his pc: but most "how to" or done for i815 or i910, but i cant find which one hes using ;s
[02:05] <ajopaul> miranda82: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[02:05] <miranda82> ajopaul, let me see! thx :)
[02:05] <jamesstansell> hype: the Xorg logfile should have it
[02:05] <miranda82> ajopaul, but, it's not changing..
[02:06] <jason_> hype: Looks like thats the i810, but dont come hunt me down if im wrong
[02:06] <miranda82> ajopaul, i mean, i want to see what speed is he using now, not what he's capable
[02:06] <binary_goofy> hi room! i need to give cdrom mount rights to user. can somebody pls help me going about this??
[02:06] <miranda82> capable? do u say that in english?
[02:06] <hype> jason_ , i'd like to be sure :)
[02:06] <dob1> hi
[02:07] <ajopaul> hmm! dono if dude changes speed everytime
[02:07] <dob1> are there any option to pass at boot for install ubuntu on sata disk?  i have problem to boot the installation cd
[02:07] <hype> binary_goofy , here is my line in fstab: /dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
[02:07] <jamesstansell> hype: from my Xorg.0.log file: (II) I810: Driver for Intel Integrated Graphics Chipsets: i810, i810-dc100,

[02:07] <jamesstansell> (
[02:07] <hype> ho cheers jamesstansell , will try that
[02:08] <jamesstansell> I have the 82865G
[02:08] <cyzie> how do i share my printer over the network using samba?
[02:08] <hype> jamesstansell , did you determine that from Worg log?
[02:08] <fnf> Hi, is there anyone here owning an Acer notebook ?. I can't seem to get my battery info.
[02:09] <hype> (i do nt see any line about  82865G in your Xorg.log output o0)
[02:09] <gnufied> i am unable to install msttcorefotns package..i remember i used to isnert a line to refer in /etc/apt/source.lst to refer that repo
[02:09] <jamesstansell> hype: although when I enable 3D (on dapper) some programs will crash the whole system
[02:09] <hype> ok :/
[02:09] <jamesstansell> hype: I think the 865G in the output refers to my card
[02:09] <miranda82> is there any command to check what speed is actually working my cpu?
[02:09] <binary_goofy> hype: mine reads - /dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   auto ro,auto,user,exec     0       0
[02:09] <gnufied> mstffcorefonts fails to install because its there in some ohter repo
[02:09] <binary_goofy> wat do i need to change here?
[02:10] <hype> only difference i see is exec
[02:10] <bigusdickus> miranda82, cat /proc/cpuinfo
[02:10] <binary_goofy> hype: my drive is a dvd-burner
[02:10] <hype> me too :(
[02:10] <miranda82> bigusdickus, that does not say the actual speed, but the top speed he's able..
[02:11] <binary_goofy> hype: so wit udf, iso9660 under type, does it allow u to load all types of cds, dvds?
[02:11] <bigusdickus> miranda82, install the CPU Frequency Monitory GNOME Applet then.
[02:12] <miranda82> bigusdickus, i already have it, but it is not real..
[02:12] <miranda82> bigusdickus, or 1,6 or 2.8
[02:13] <fnf> miranda82: The CPU always run at full speed, unless you did some sort of scaling, how did you know it wasn't real ?
[02:13] <scheuri> bigusdickus: what a nickname...
[02:13] <hype> binary_goofy , nope, i've had issues with udf birnt dvds recnetly
[02:13] <hype> i didnt look to much to fix it tho
[02:13] <kevb> jamesstansell: I found the command dpkg-buildpackage but something odd happened... it tried to apply the patch in question (the one from the launchpad bug thread)... it couldn't do it cos i'd already changed the code :S
[02:13] <miranda82> fnf, cuz i can't be working at 1,6 while i'm not doing anything
[02:13] <bigusdickus> what do you mean with "not real" do you ant more accurate numbers?
[02:14] <jamesstansell> hype: yikes :)
[02:14] <miranda82> bigusdickus, yeah, more acurate
[02:14] <fnf> miranda82: You mean the average load ?
[02:14] <miranda82> fnf, yeah probably
[02:14] <hype> ^^
[02:14] <jamesstansell> kevb: I guess undo your changes?
[02:14] <binary_goofy> hype: thanks pal. but wat i specifically need is how to give rights to user to mount from command line using mount.
[02:14] <fnf> miranda82: 1.6 MHz/GHz ?
[02:14] <kevb> jamesstansell: Doing that now, just wondering where the path came from!! : )
[02:15] <kevb> jamesstansell: patch*
[02:15] <TooTallJones> So I just bought this AGP 512MB geforce 7600 GS.  But 3D acceleration isn't working properly in windows or my linux OS.  Also my BIOS doesn't have the selection for 512MB ram on a graphics card.  Is this probably because my BIOS is out of date? Why 3D won't work that is
[02:15] <hype> binary_goofy , the "user" line should have done it :(
[02:15] <hype> or mayben try "users"
[02:15] <bigusdickus> miranda82, do this, try with xfce4-cpu-freq-plugin and with the  CPU Frequency Monitor GNOME Applet, if their output is similar, probably you are wrong.
[02:15] <hype> with a "s"
[02:15] <hype> :p
[02:15] <Cimi> hi
[02:15] <binary_goofy> hype: nah. wen i try to run mount as user, gives me an error saying only root can mount
[02:16] <hype> you want any other user to mount it? or just your user?
[02:16] <miranda82> bigusdickus, i already have that applet
[02:16] <Cimi> i need a french!!!
[02:16] <bigusdickus> miranda82, so?
[02:16] <hype> ho
[02:16] <Cimi> anyone is french here?
[02:16] <miranda82> bigusdickus, nah, u're right
[02:16] <hype> binary_goofy .. you have to be root to mount a device
[02:16] <hype> Cimi , non
[02:16] <hype> :)
[02:16] <infidel> Cimi, french yuck
[02:16] <Cimi> i need translation of "murrine configurator"
[02:16] <Cimi> and
[02:16] <Cimi> Configure themes based on the murrine engine
[02:17] <jamesstansell> kevb: sometimes there will be different patches with the same name.  Did you find the 2.1 source package?
[02:17] <binary_goofy> hype: but can't i change dat. i just need to give user rights to mount cdrom only
[02:17] <hype> murrine...is a themme , no?
[02:17] <TooTallJones> Also after xserver-xorg reconfig my computer is still only calling the geforce card an Nvidia default card
[02:17] <livingdaylight> tar xvf tar.gz?
[02:17] <coz_> Cimi, no way to google the translations??

[02:17] <infidel> how do i make my terminal fonts color?
[02:17] <hype> Cimi, au fait , #ubuntu-fr

[02:18] <jdawson> Where did "run as different user" go to on edgy?
[02:18] <jamesstansell> kevb: the repository can contain multiple versions, but yeah, I normally wouldn

[02:19] <binary_goofy> hype: can't i give user mount rights den?

[02:19] <jdawson> constrictor: I don't have an applications - > system tools
[02:19] <constrictor> jdawson: kubuntu or ubuntu

[02:20] <jdawson> Ubuntu 6.10
[02:20] <constrictor> jdawson: do you have alacarte installed
[02:20] <livingdaylight> can someone help me with a command?
[02:20] <MetaMorfoziS> how can i identify my ram's speed?
[02:20] <coz_> constrictor, alacarte is default install on edgy

[02:21] <kevb> jamesstansell: I've installed the new package so I can test it now. Heres a harder question : ) How do I start vino from command line : )
[02:21] <coz_> constrictor, on edgy it is is system/preferences/menulayout
[02:21] <livingdaylight> is it cp /media/cdrom1/photoalbum.tar.gz /home/conrad ?
[02:22] <rausb0> livingdaylight: should work, yes
[02:22] <binary_goofy> livingdaylight: yes it is
[02:22] <livingdaylight> thx, guys
[02:22] <constrictor> i see, a bit old fashioned aren't i :-~)
[02:22] <jamesstansell> kevb: /usr/bin/vino ?
[02:22] <rausb0> livingdaylight: (if your home dir is /home/conrad)
[02:22] <coz_> constrictor, not at all you are on dapper not edgy
[02:22] <livingdaylight> rausb0: you cheeky monkey :D
[02:22] <constrictor> just upgraded actually
[02:22] <constrictor> :-)
[02:23] <rausb0> livingdaylight: remember you can use the TAB key in the shell to complete path names
[02:23] <coz_> constrictor, maybe the upgrade soes not change menu order
[02:23] <atk_> Hi. Can you suggest a light weight http server for my laptop? It would be nice if it supported php
[02:23] <constrictor> true
[02:23] <kevb> jamesstansell: Nope, I'm not sure how vino works, have a horrible feeling I can only do it by restarting gnome/X
[02:23] <livingdaylight> rauble: ok, i'll try that
[02:23] <kevb> jamesstansell: which I really don't want to do
[02:23] <jamesstansell> kevb: " whereis vino" says /usr/lib/vino which is a bit weird

[02:24] <exalted> Any "powerpc" specific Ubuntu channel, or can i just ask here?

[02:24] <binary_goofy> jdawson: thanks. checking it now.
[02:24] <coz_> exalted let me check for you
[02:24] <El_Che> 2
[02:25] <exalted> coz_, Thank you!
[02:25] <livingdaylight> rauble: could i have untarred it at the same time?
[02:25] <bigusdickus> livingdaylight, yes with tar xvzf as I told you
[02:25] <kevb> jamesstansell: actually it seems to be running... but it's got the same problem : )
[02:26] <jamesstansell> kevb: on the quit menu there's an option to log on as another user, which starts a 2nd gnome session.  would that help?
[02:26] <kevb> ARRRGGHHH
[02:26] <livingdaylight> bigusdickus: i didn't see your reply,sorry
[02:26] <atk_> constrictor: thanks
[02:26] <kevb> jamesstansell: maybe, but I'm not at the machine, this is my problem : )
[02:26] <Dimensions> hi ... i have used a few days ago mysql with php pages but now when i do mysqltest it says mysqltest: Could not open connection 'default': 2002 Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2) not ok
[02:26] <livingdaylight> bigusdickus: and my question was about copying and untarring at the same time. That would be quite a command wouldn't it?
[02:26] <kevb> jamesstansell: SSH only
[02:27] <jamesstansell> kevb: maybe it didn't really have the newest version of the patch?
[02:27] <kevb> jamesstansell: It seems not, I wonder if the patch changed the source so I can check
[02:27] <TooTallJones> How wouuld I go about a BIOS update in linux?
[02:27] <MattJ> Dimensions, anything in your setup changed to cause that?
[02:28] <MattJ> I'm using MySQL fine here
[02:28] <jason_> Dimensions: one thing you could try just for the hek of it is, /etc/init.d/mysql restart
[02:28] <PlanarPlatypus> TooTallJones, depends on the motherboard but the usual procedure I have seen involves a bootable floppy disk
[02:28] <coz_> exalted, I can t find a specific channel for that so Ask away here some one must use poc with ubuntu
[02:28] <CodeX__> hi
[02:28] <atk_> constrictor: lighttpd seems good and has lot of features :)
[02:28] <exalted> coz_, alright.
[02:28] <TooTallJones> Yeah I just found the update downloads, but I don't know which motherboard I have lol
[02:28] <CodeX__> has anyone got jackd running with edgy eft?
[02:28] <livingdaylight> bigusdickus: what is the difference between tar xvf and tar xvzf like you said ?
[02:29] <constrictor> atk_ yeah it's really helpful but i like apache because i'm used to it
[02:29] <kevb> jamesstansell: I need a way to do dpkg-buildpackage without applying any patches now
[02:29] <pukeko> how do i detect nics ( a clean start ) - as i have deleted /etc/network/interfaces  ?
[02:29] <TooTallJones> So next question, how can I see what type of motherboard I have
[02:29] <bigusdickus> livingdaylight, with z you filter the archive through gzip effectively gunzipping it before extracting the archive, (for tar.gz or tgz files)
[02:30] <atk_> constrictor: I've used apache too but I prefer smaller servers in this case. My laptop already has few heavy stuff running besides normal firefox etc.
[02:30] <livingdaylight> bigusdickus: zo simply tar xvf is not sufficient?
[02:31] <constrictor> atk_ yeah i can appreciate that
[02:31] <pukeko> if i type discover they are both listed - what do i do next
[02:31] <jamesstansell> kevb: dpkg-buildpackage looks like it tries to be too smart
[02:31] <jason_> TooTallJones: you could type sudo halt and then take your side panel off and have a  look at the MB, Or you could restart the computer and try to catch the ID that is usually printed at the lower right or top of the screen
[02:31] <bigusdickus> livingdaylight, I was wrong I just tested and I see that it works without the z option too. tar is crap
[02:31] <LabThug> This morning in my software updates (for Edgy), I had a "Distribution update" for gkrellm.  However, It's greyed out.  How do I resolve this update?
[02:31] <exalted> I'd be really come handy right now that someone could point me an ubuntu guide on powerpc installation, since i'm having trouble to figure out how to get / where to put yaboot. Ubuntu installation claims that he can not find any newworld partition and yaboot needs a Apple_Bootstrap partition, so installation won't proceed. I've been a PC guy, and now trying to install on a friend's mac, but having lil difficulties. Any help is appreciated, thank you.
[02:31] <bigusdickus> livingdaylight, old versions of tar don't though
[02:32] <coz_> exaulted let me google for a how to
[02:32] <rausb0> TooTallJones: you can try "sudo dmidecode | less" but it doesnt work with all boards
[02:32] <kevb> jamesstansell: I think patches might be files in the source tree, i probably need to delete them
[02:32] <exalted> coz_, sure...
[02:32] <scoo> hi @ll
[02:32] <coz_> exalted, what ppc are you using new world or old world?
[02:32] <jamesstansell> kevb: maybe you can remove the patch file that you don't want applied?
[02:32] <pukeko> does kudzu exist for ubuntu ?
[02:33] <jamesstansell> kevb: yeah, like you just said
[02:33] <exalted> coz_, well this is an ibook g3, not sure if its old/new world
[02:33] <TIger_IT> pukeko: kdesu
[02:33] <coz_> exalted, G3 is new world hold on
[02:33] <livingdaylight> bigusdickus: lol, so either.... well, its alot of letters to remember in the right order. So, if xvf works then that is one less letter to remember
[02:33] <exalted> coz_, :D
[02:33] <TIger_IT> pukeko: kdesu is called gkdesu
[02:33] <bigusdickus> livingdaylight, right :)
[02:33] <kevb> jamesstansell: I just don't know where they are. Any idea what a patch looks like?
[02:34] <pukeko> TIger: cli only
[02:34] <TIger_IT> pukeko: just sudo
[02:34] <pukeko> jsut sudo ... ok ..??
[02:35] <cartucho> has anyone managed to install dbdesigner4 in ubuntu ?
[02:35] <coz_> exalted, is this anintel based cpu
[02:35] <cartucho> egy
[02:35] <coz_> exalted, intel
[02:35] <exalted> coz_, no it's a powerpc
[02:35] <coz_> exalted, ok hold on
[02:35] <rausb0> pukeko: hardware detection is not done by kudzu in ubuntu, it uses udev for that.
[02:35] <rausb0> TIger_IT: he meant kudzu, not kdesu
[02:35] <pukeko> TIger: i just want to detect and configure my nics
[02:35] <ripper__> i have an ati all in wonder 7500 , and i was looking at swapping video cards out, right now there is an ati rage II pro in this box, if i put the AIW in this pc, will my xserver break?
[02:35] <jamesstansell> kevb: patches are generally unified diff files - sometimes they'll have a .diff extension
[02:36] <coz_> exalted, are you able to boot from the cd holding down the "c" key
[02:36] <TIger_IT> rausb0:  ahh OK...
[02:36] <exalted> coz_, yeah; i've already arrived to the level of formatting the drive...
[02:37] <TIger_IT> xD
[02:37] <rausb0> pukeko: detection is done by udev, configuration can be done with some GUI tool (i dont use that) or by editing /etc/network/interfaces
[02:37] <coz_> exalted,  ok just wanted to be sure it was new world old world g3 acnnot boot from cd that way
[02:37] <exalted> coz_, oh, i see...
[02:37] <kevb> jamesstansell: under ./debian/ there is a file called stamp-patch-debian=patches=01_fix_password_free.patch which is the patch i saw when i built the package. Problem is it's not a patch, its empty
[02:37] <rausb0> TIger_IT: kudzu is rehat's hardware detection tool
[02:37] <rausb0> *redhat's
[02:38] <pukeko> rausb0: no gui here..
[02:38] <kevb> jamesstansell: ahh, found ./debian/patches with patches in it
[02:38] <TIger_IT> rausb0:  thanks! I didnt know
[02:38] <coz_> exalted, can you be more specific as to the model of the laptop
[02:38] <rausb0> pukeko: so read "man 5 interfaces" and edit /etc/network/interfaces accordingly
[02:38] <exalted> coz_, "iBook G3" =)
[02:39] <coz_> exalted, ok
[02:39] <CodeX__> is nobody doing audio-recording with ubuntu?
[02:40] <pukeko> rausb0: i deleted it to see what would happen - hoping i could get it to rewrite itself by using a tool like netconfig which i don't seem to have : )
[02:40] <coz_> exalted, here is a starting point, not exactly what you want but look at this while I google more   http://research.naumachiarius.com/ibook-debian.html
[02:40] <coolpaul900> I need help!!!

[02:41] <coolpaul900> I am having BIG problem
[02:41] <coz_> exalted, well I am still looking so don't go anywhere
[02:41] <rausb0> pukeko: deleting system files just to see what happens is a bad idea :)  (at least without backup)
[02:41] <exalted> coz_, ok :)
[02:42] <coolpaul900> I accidentily installed xubuntu when I was in aptitude
[02:42] <coolpaul900> and it removed all ubuntu programs

[02:44] <knowledgEngi> way do not exyst ubuntu optimised for i686 ???

[02:45] <knowledgEngi> i know that i386 can work under i686 cpu
[02:45] <jamesstansell> kevb: the bug has the patch, right?  can you replace the old one with the new one from the bug?
[02:45] <knowledgEngi> but if is compiled for i686 i think is much better
[02:46] <kevb> jamesstansell: The file in attached to the bug looks very different to the one in debian/patches, considering it's a one line change
[02:46] <coz_> exalted, well so far not too much ... I might be working it incorrectly... however that particular link I gave you gives enough info to get started i wish you luck,, i tried ubuntu on an old world g3 with no luck cannot boot from cd

[02:50] <darkanyel> hi

[02:50] <juanx> hi

[03:00] <exalted> coz_, i'll go with a little reverse-engineering-mind. First i'll let Ubuntu format the drive automatically however he wants (seems to work). And then i'll look what he has done, and make a second custom installation like the way i want it... Thank you for your efforts.

[03:10] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:10] <Scoo> livingdaylight, VLC maybe ?
[03:10] <dcordes> cypher: reinstalling did not work
[03:10] <cypher> dcordes:
[03:10] <jamesstansell> !debdiff
[03:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about debdiff - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:10] <dcordes> cypher: could you  dcc me your vmc?
[03:10] <sorush21> I get the same error with any thing that I try to use sudo jrib
[03:10] <dcordes> vmx
[03:10] <jrib> sorush21: no, you don't need to.  It would just be more convenient if you had.  You'll have to reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  Then edit sudoers and fix your syntax.  In the future, using visudo toe dit will rpevent this from happening

[03:17] <cypher> is till use athlon 2600+
[03:17] <[ANF] MasterNinja> hang on im going to try something to fix it and come back cause its a long story on what i did wrong
[03:17] <jrib> phenex: yeah, that's just your grep :) not actually firefox
[03:17] <kmaynard> cypher, then use dapper...easy choice
[03:17] <phenex> hmm...
[03:17] <jrib> phenex: try 'firefox -safe-mode'
[03:17] <phenex> ok... now i fell even lamer :P
[03:17] <jamesstansell> kevb: I've got to leave.  Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
[03:17] <egal> hi
[03:17] <rambo3> heh i always  run stable ubuntu for max 1 month , till first beta
[03:17] <kmaynard> heck, you could always install FF2 from mozilla.com, and even gaim 2 if you want, just run it on top of dapper
[03:18] <Unimatrix9> cypher, as in the matrix?
[03:18] <kmaynard> there's a few new features in nautilus that i love, but dapper is still rockin
[03:18] <phenex> jrib, works under safe mode
[03:18] <jrib> phenex: ok, close it, and just run 'firefox'.  What does it say?
[03:18] <sorush20> jrib: I got into grub what can I do exactly?
[03:18] <jrib> sorush20: select "recovery mode" from the menu
[03:19] <jrib> sorush20: then use 'visudo' and fix your syntax
[03:19] <cypher> neo man
[03:19] <Dimensions> jason_away: .... when i do /etc/init.d/mysql restart it says ... ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
[03:19] <Unimatrix9> nock nock
[03:19] <sorush20> jrib: you mean just select the same kernel image but with the recovery mode that is infront of it/
[03:19] <phenex> jrib, Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[03:19] <Unimatrix9> follow the white rabit :P
[03:20] <cypher> cool
[03:20] <jrib> sorush20: hmm there should be some option that just says "Recovery mode".  This was the case in dapper, though I haven't looked at it in edgy
[03:20] <sorush20> at the end it says press ctrl + D to continue to enter root password for administration..
[03:20] <jrib> sorush20: ok maybe it changed, try that
[03:20] <cypher> hahaha
[03:21] <webben> Is there any way to install the spidermonkey library?
[03:21] <cypher> so lets talk serious
[03:21] <jrib> phenex: firefox -ProfileManager    try making a new profile
[03:21] <Unimatrix9> whats spidermonkey? ( alway's ready to learn new things )
[03:21] <[ANF] MasterNinja> EMERGANCY I need the chmod command to enable to view contents of a particular folder.
[03:21] <jrib> [ANF] MasterNinja: what folder
[03:21] <[ANF] MasterNinja> install folder somethings gone deadly wrong
[03:21] <phenex> jrib, but but my profile :( all my bookmarks and everything
[03:22] <jrib> phenex: it will still be there, you can copy the bookmarks over
[03:22] <cypher> sweeeet
[03:22] <kmaynard> chmod u+r folder/
[03:22] <[ANF] MasterNinja> thx
[03:23] <babo> what's the story with mozphone ? has anyone here used it ?
[03:23] <kmaynard> for the contents chmod -R u+r folder/
[03:23] <jrib> webben: apt-cache search spider monkey   turns up 6 packages
[03:23] <kmaynard> that just gives the owner read permission...
[03:23] <webben> jrib: yes, but i can't seem to actually install them
[03:23] <jrib> webben: what happens
[03:23] <Unimatrix9> ok i am off to ubuntu-laptop....
[03:23] <mirak> phanter:
[03:23] <Unimatrix9> bye bye
[03:23] <egal> i'd like to try out ubuntu, so i put the kernel and ramdisk from dists/edgy/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/ on an empty partition and booted from it. now the installer doesn't seem to support a network installation and only offers to look for an install-iso-image.
[03:23] <Unimatrix9> take care...all you geeks
[03:24] <cypher> geeeeks rule
[03:24] <webben> jrib: ah I may have just gotten it working :)
[03:24] <tat> egal: try the net-install image
[03:24] <Unimatrix9> yeah! they do, especially cypher!
[03:24] <Unimatrix9> :P
[03:24] <phenex> jrib, works with new profile.
[03:24] <cypher> true man
[03:25] <livingdaylight> TomaszD: no, sound working too :) Sound was somehow tied up by something else. Rebooted and it works completely now
[03:25] <phenex> how can i move over my bookmarks and addons and all
[03:25] <[ANF] MasterNinja> oh noes
[03:25] <TomaszD> livingdaylight, cool, glad it works.
[03:25] <[ANF] MasterNinja> it says it doesnt exist but i know that folder exists
[03:25] <jrib> phenex: ok then it may be an extension problem.  I'm not sure of this, but set your regular profile to default, start safe mode, and then see if you can disable all the extensions
[03:25] <livingdaylight> TomaszD: thx again. That makes my day to be able to watch movies of my kid i made some years back :D
[03:26] <livingdaylight> TomaszD: in future i must remember on a fresh ubuntu install to install Totem-xine then and something-extracodecs?
[03:26] <TomaszD> libxine-extracodecs
[03:26] <TomaszD> yes
[03:26] <sexcopter8000> does anyone know how you can set up the gnome xchat client to auth with Q automatically when xchat connects?
[03:26] <phenex> jrib, it doesn't let me manage addons from safe mode
[03:26] <[ANF] MasterNinja> i screwed my folders up so much im gonna chicken out and reinstall ubuntu
[03:26] <asraniel> hi, i have a problem with dapper. im want to look a film, but the sound is.. strange. its like i was listening to a vinil disk, but that there was one bug scratch on it
[03:27] <kevb> Anyone know anything about the current vino issue in edgy?
[03:27] <jrib> phenex: k, then your options are to a) figure out how to disable extensions b) use the new profile and copy over the settings you want (see ~/.mozilla/firefox/ )
[03:27] <egal> tat: the thing is, i actually have a full ubuntu iso, but the installer doesn't let me mount the related partition and supply the path - the only option is to make an automated search that doesn't work. this is kind of irritating.
[03:27] <dcordes> vino???!
[03:28] <sexcopter8000> (i'm referring to when xchat connects to quakenet of course)
[03:28] <tat> egal: oh..

[03:30] <jrib> [ANF] MasterNinja: as long as you didn't touch anything outside your home, the worst-case scenario would be to make a fresh new user

[03:35] <jrib> [ANF] MasterNinja: join #ubuntu-classroom and we'll sort out this mysterious 'install' folder if you wish (don't want to clog up #ubuntu with a bunch of commands back and forth)
[03:35] <jrib> phenex: ah good to know, thanks
[03:35] <KenSentMe> I have a command that i want to run everytime the system is started and it needs to be run by root. Where do i put it?

[03:36] <cypher> ahh
[03:36] <[ANF] MasterNinja> ah as long as its runs smooth keep it as it is
[03:36] <DevDuck> thats my feeling
[03:36] <sticazzi> there's a package that I need to remove and the removal in Synaptic fails: E: graphviz-cairo: subprocess post-removal script returned error exit status 127
[03:36] <cypher> r u good in shell
[03:36] <soundray> kevb: still here?
[03:36] <sticazzi> how can I clean this up?
[03:36] <[ANF] MasterNinja> yeah have you got alot of stuff installed?
[03:36] <Ace_NoOne> hi there - quick newbie question: I'm determined to make finally the switch to Ubunto. Now I've read a lot about how Edgy screwed up many people's systems - does this only affect upgrades from Dapper or should I start with Dapper rather than Edgy?
[03:36] <n2k> sticazzi: i've got that on powerpc too.
[03:37] <DevDuck> it's a very customized system
[03:37] <Ace_NoOne> *finally make *sigh*
[03:37] <kevb> soundray: yeah man
[03:37] <sticazzi> Ace_NoOne, from scratch it's fine
[03:37] <[ANF] MasterNinja> ah you'd best keep it as it is
[03:37] <sticazzi> just make enough space for it.. what's your HDD setup?
[03:37] <[ANF] MasterNinja> yeah Edgy is like electronic love
[03:37] <jrib> [ANF] MasterNinja: I've only seen problems with the upgrade route for some people, but try both live cd's and see what you prefer
[03:37] <sticazzi> n2k, mine is a standard x86
[03:37] <DevDuck> it's running, so having gnomeoffice and the ilk isn't a big deal
[03:37] <jrib> Ace_NoOne: I've only seen problems with the upgrade route for some people, but try both live cd's and see what you prefer
[03:37] <DShepherd> Ace_NoOne: it only applies to Dapper Edgy upgrades...
[03:38] <kevb> soundray: You got any ideas?
[03:38] <[ANF] MasterNinja> ya
[03:38] <Ace_NoOne> ok thx
[03:38] <gnufied> my apt tree is in mess, because a package called python-subversion failed to install, because of "bus error ldconfig" now every damn package I install/remove complains about that..and won't let me install/remove anything eventually
[03:38] <Ace_NoOne> sticazzi: 2x320GB - that should be enough :D
[03:38] <soundray> kevb: open your /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom (or create a new one if not existing). Find a section called [daemon]  and add two lines: "AutomaticLoginEnable=true" and "AutomaticLogin=user", replacing user with your username.
[03:38] <sticazzi> yeah, are they SATA, EIDE or mixture?
[03:38] <DShepherd> Ace_NoOne: Dapper seems to be rock solid and you can start with that if you like... Edgy... well its a bit edgy,,, you can jump to that too if you like
[03:38] <ayaa> do you suggest using easyubuntu to get the fllash and java plugins on my ubuntu ?
[03:38] <variant> http://www.platinax.co.uk/news/01-11-2006/linux-distros-ubuntu-trustix-and-suse-accused-of-email-spam/ <--- lol
[03:38] <Ace_NoOne> sticazzi: 2xSATA2
[03:38] <[ANF] MasterNinja> hmm i wander what the admin group gives me
[03:38] <Dimensions> Loceur u can get it from http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download
[03:38] <rambo3> ayaa, use apt
[03:38] <sticazzi> Ace_NoOne, you're fine
[03:38] <[ANF] MasterNinja> i bet it gives me execution rights
[03:38] <jrib> !flash > ayaa
[03:39] <jrib> !java > ayaa
[03:39] <Ace_NoOne> cool - thanks for the info guys
[03:39] <kevb> soundray: Thanks, I'll give that a try right now
[03:39] <[ANF] MasterNinja> anyone had problems running scripts?
[03:39] <jrib> [ANF] MasterNinja: admin gives you ability to use sudo
[03:39] <rambo3> [ANF] MasterNinja, more specific
[03:40] <[ANF] MasterNinja> perfect cause my driver wont install cause user doesnt have execution rights
[03:40] <Flats> What is the Ubuntu control file? Inetd.conf found in /etc?
[03:40] <Bokeh> <variant> http://www.platinax.co.uk/news/01-11-2006/linux-distros-ubuntu-trustix-and-suse-accused-of-email-spam/ <-- that is about the dumbest article i've read in quite a while
[03:40] <Bokeh> very typical PHB material
[03:40] <tRSS> what is bonobo-activation-server?

[03:40] <[ANF] MasterNinja> dumbass story
[03:41] <Bokeh> yeah
[03:41] <[ANF] MasterNinja> you can smell it
[03:41] <Bokeh> must be some muppet who can't be arsed reading the footer in a mailing list message about how to send an unsubscribe mail to a list
[03:41] <[ANF] MasterNinja> i read something about linux sucking at running games
[03:42] <[ANF] MasterNinja> :P
[03:42] <sticazzi> anyone know how to de-install a package manually, it's stopping me from upgrading the system and all sorts of other stuff
[03:42] <Bokeh> hehe
[03:42] <[ANF] MasterNinja> yeah but thats direct x though
[03:42] <kevb> soundray: You don't know anything about vino do you?
=== aloysio is now known as AFigueiredo
[03:42] <[ANF] MasterNinja> wine will emulate direct 3d at some point
[03:42] <Bokeh> the usual "gaming on linux sucks so we won't make any games for linux" farce
[03:42] <TomaszD> sticazzi, try sudo apt-get -f install
[03:42] <[ANF] MasterNinja> then windows will be screwed
[03:42] <TomaszD> just that
[03:42] <Bokeh> doubtful :)
[03:42] <kmaynard> gaming is for consoles
[03:42] <soundray> sticazzi: post the output of 'sudo apt-get -f install' on the pastebin pls (see /topic)
[03:42] <cyzie> what is the command to add/remove locale after the system is installed?
[03:42] <Bokeh> people will still stay with windows if only because of the vendor-lockin
[03:43] <soundray> kevb: try me
[03:43] <[ANF] MasterNinja> doesnt that transgaming will run most games anyways
[03:43] <sticazzi>  executing..
[03:43] <dutchy> dual boot works fine. but screw nwn2 for not having native linux support!!
[03:43] <[ANF] MasterNinja> its run bf2142
[03:43] <hoelk> hmm
[03:43] <xamox> what IDS does everyone suggest?
[03:43] <kmaynard> people stay with windows because they can get a $4-500 pc that does tall they want it to, works with crap off-the-shelf hardware, etc
[03:43] <hoelk> i want to play a game windowed with wine that starts foolscreen by default
[03:43] <[ANF] MasterNinja> no shadowing effets though but plays fine
[03:43] <hoelk> any idea how to achieve that?
[03:43] <Bokeh> that's hardly an argument anymore kmaynard
[03:43] <kmaynard> there's a lot of people i dont want using linux
[03:44] <Bokeh> a local computer store sells computers with dapper preinstalled (OEM installation), and it does anything a normal desktop user wants to do 90% of the time
[03:44] <rambo3> in this channel ?

[03:44] <Dimensions> Hiya guys ... i dont know some thing is wrong but when i try to access mysql with php page or try to start mysql or restart it i get this message every time .... and when i check mysqld in the location it states ... its not there either ... ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
[03:44] <[ANF] MasterNinja> look if u dont buy vista you'll have $200 more to spend on hardware
[03:44] <sticazzi> that's the output
[03:44] <ayaa> where can i find sun-java5-jre package
[03:44] <kevb> soundray: Theres a current bug (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/65795). A fix is there, I'm not sure what to do with it. So far I have altered the source like I think it describes and have built it and installed it. I'm just rebooting to see if it works but I don't think it has. I'm wondering if there is a sane way to fix it : )
[03:44] <kmaynard> Bokeh, they'll just bring it back and ask for windows when it doesnt run {app here]  or work with [device here] 
=== SportChick is now known as SportlessChick
[03:45] <rambo3> Dimensions, can you access it in terminal
[03:45] <hangfire> ayaa- type java5 into a synaptec search
[03:45] <Bokeh> the problem is shit like directx, asp, which causes software developers to stick with windows because it'd actually cost them to make software platform-independent
[03:45] <dutchy> kmaynard: perhaps those ppl would be better off with mac os x than windows :> (although i've never tried mac os x myself, it sounds reasonably fool-proof :>)
[03:45] <soundray> sticazzi: you have some package manager running. Quit it, redo the apt-get -f install and paste the output again pls
[03:45] <rambo3> Dimensions,  mysql -p root
[03:45] <sticazzi> pardon me
[03:45] <kmaynard> dutchy, more than agreed
[03:45] <Bokeh> hehe
[03:45] <Bokeh> true :)
[03:45] <[ANF] MasterNinja> cmon im a real noob GUI obsessed windows user but after a few days i can fumble my way round the router to do standard stuff soon ill have a linux clone of what i had on xp including games, drivers and software.

[03:46] <LjL> !offtopic
[03:46] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:46] <[ANF] MasterNinja> were talking about ubuntu
[03:46] <kmaynard> LjL, sorry...got carried away
[03:46] <StephenL> Anyone know of good open source Project Management software?
[03:46] <mike_> Hello, how do i do so i can start a program by just typing for example "firefox" insteed of "/usr/bin/firefox"
[03:46] <sticazzi> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29732/
[03:47] <Andy> StephenL: what are u looking for? eclipse?
[03:47] <LjL> StephenL: what about planner?
[03:47] <[ANF] MasterNinja> does win amp run on wine?
[03:47] <Bokeh> it does
[03:47] <Bokeh> but why would you want winamp?
[03:48] <sticazzi> doesn't here
[03:48] <aoupi> mike_: make sure it is in your path (echo $PATH) or make a new directory with your apps that you add to your path(add a line in your .bashrc that says PATH=$PATH:/my/apps)
[03:48] <[ANF] MasterNinja> cant be bothered to install codecs for freeware :P
[03:48] <rambo3> mikl, alias export ldconf
[03:48] <soundray> kevb: what's your current version of vino?
[03:48] <StephenL> I was looking at http://www.openworkbench.org/ but it looks like a stale project.  I'll check out planner.  Thanks.
[03:48] <[ANF] MasterNinja> unless installing codecs is easy
[03:48] <variant> [ANF] MasterNinja: freeware?
[03:48] <PlanarPlatypus> [ANF] MasterNinja, you can get it to run under wine but have you looked at xmms as an alternative?
[03:48] <TooTallJones> anyone who can help me with upgrading my BIOS?
[03:48] <mikl> rambo3: interesting :)
[03:48] <[ANF] MasterNinja> does xmms have the codecs installed?
[03:49] <PlanarPlatypus> [ANF] MasterNinja, for what file format?
[03:49] <kevb> soundray: It's 2.16.0-0ubuntu2 not 2.16.0-0ubuntu2.1
[03:49] <mike_> aoupi: Thanks, I'm going to try it now. I'll report back.
[03:49] <jmitchj> could someone help me with this message?..."W: GPG error: http://ubuntu.moshen.de dapper Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY FC0A1CC62F306651"
[03:49] <[ANF] MasterNinja> mp3,mp4 among others
[03:49] <soundray> TooTallJones: this isn't the best channel to ask. Have you looked at the motherboard manufacturer's web site?
[03:49] <josh__> who uses vi in here?
[03:49] <aoupi> mike_: just one thing, don't put your own app in /usr/bin, it's best to let ubuntu handle that path by itself
[03:49] <josh__> or vim
[03:49] <rambo3> mikl, yeah i thought so , this nickname complatation  in xchat is science
[03:49] <sticazzi> If I actually hit "yes" then I get the following error: /var/lib/dpkg/info/graphviz-cairo.postrm: 11: dot: not found   subprocess post-removal script returned error exit status 127
[03:50] <rausb0> [ANF] MasterNinja: xmms comes with mp3 by default. ogg and others can be installed too. mp4 i dont know.
[03:50] <rausb0> josh__: whats the question?
[03:50] <[ANF] MasterNinja> i dont have any mp4's anyway but i want windows media and quick time to work as well
[03:50] <mikl> rambo3: yeah, it's not easy to figure out
=== SportlessChick is now known as SportChick
[03:50] <KenSentMe> I have a command that i want to run everytime the system is started and it needs to be run by root. Where do i put it?
[03:51] <soundray> kevb: I think you'll have to apt-get the source to vino as well as the build dependencies, then apply the patch and recompile.
[03:51] <josh__> when i do a "/search string" in a file... it will find one... is there a command that will make it search for that string again?
[03:51] <rausb0> josh__: n
[03:51] <PlanarPlatypus> [ANF] MasterNinja, try installing gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly, this should give you mp3 and windows media playback
[03:51] <josh__> or do i have to continually type "/search string" for each instance
[03:51] <josh__> "n"?
[03:52] <cyzie> what is the command to add/remove locale after the system is installed?
[03:52] <josh__> woot woot
[03:52] <PlanarPlatypus> [ANF] MasterNinja, not tried quicktime personally but I am told it works
[03:52] <rausb0> josh__: "n" for next
[03:52] <josh__> thats rausb0
[03:52] <josh__> tanks
[03:52] <[ANF] MasterNinja> ill make a note
[03:52] <kevb> KenSentMe: You probably want to put a script in /etc/rc0.d/ but I'm not sure

[03:55] <alek> i want to add files from /home/alek/files/ to my repository places in /home/alek/respos. how to do it?
[03:56] <The_Machine> lol
[03:56] <soundray> kevb: how annoying. Sorry, I've no ideas. Perhaps you want to add your experience to the bug report.
[03:56] <rambo3> Dimensions, so you dont have Linux Apache Mysql Php ?
[03:56] <KenSentMe> StephenL, and others: thank you
[03:56] <soundray> sticazzi: what happens if you hit Y at this point?
[03:56] <aoupi> The_Machine: you can try xpaint, but that might be too simple
[03:56] <sticazzi> If I actually hit "yes" then I get the following error: /var/lib/dpkg/info/graphviz-cairo.postrm: 11: dot: not found   subprocess post-removal script returned error exit status 127

[03:57] <aoupi> The_Machine: :)
[03:57] <sticazzi> apt-get*
[03:57] <mamzers555> does somebody knows that if this is possible?
[03:57] <The_Machine> LOL
[03:58] <Joe_SWAU> Hi. :-) I was updating edubuntu, and my laptop lost power. Now it won't boot. I tried the boot rescue command on the live cd, but it just gave me some error.
[03:58] <rausb0> The_Machine: tuxpaint is for kids, try xpaint
[03:58] <The_Machine> hehe
[03:58] <soundray> sticazzi: can you pastebin /var/lib/dpkg/info/graphviz-cairo.postrm please
[03:58] <The_Machine> yeah
[03:58] <The_Machine> i realize that now :P
[03:58] <[ANF] MasterNinja> how do i change directory?
[03:58] <ubuntero22> hello, i have a problem installing dapper, when loading i get error such "buffer i/o error" anybody knows how can i solve this? thanks a lot for your help
[03:58] <aoupi> The_Machine: but you wont have any sound effects with xpaint, that is a major draw bacx
[03:58] <The_Machine> sound effects?
[03:58] <rausb0> [ANF] MasterNinja: in the shell?
[03:58] <georgy> cd directory
[03:58] <[ANF] MasterNinja> the terminal
[03:58] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: "some error" isn't a very helpful problem description
[03:58] <The_Machine> like lightsabers clashing?
[03:58] <The_Machine> :P
[03:59] <rausb0> [ANF] MasterNinja: cd directoryname
[03:59] <aoupi> The_Machine: yea, tuxpaint has all theese weird sounds for when you paint, yes, sounds like lightspabers sometimes
[03:59] <The_Machine> yeah
[03:59] <The_Machine> this is too simple.
[03:59] <[ANF] MasterNinja> na it wont do it says the folder doesnt exist
[03:59] <The_Machine> sigh
[03:59] <kevb> can anyone running edgy do me a massive favour? : )
[03:59] <The_Machine> i'll use gimp.
[03:59] <rausb0> [ANF] MasterNinja: where the exact specification of directoryname depends on the shell's current directory
[03:59] <The_Machine> frowns
[03:59] <The_Machine> heh
[04:00] <[ANF] MasterNinja> its /home/masterninja/install
[04:00] <ubuntero22> hello, i have a problem installing dapper, when loading i get error such "buffer i/o error" anybody knows how can i solve this? thanks a lot for your help
[04:00] <[ANF] MasterNinja> but it says the directory does not exist
[04:00] <rausb0> [ANF] MasterNinja: so look where you are now: pwd
[04:00] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Is there a rescure cd I should download, or should it be on the live cd?
[04:00] <abze> when i do apt-get update i gett an error from a program i uninstalled, asks me if u still have it, and no i dont. any way to fix it
[04:00] <sticazzi> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29734/ from line 32 onwards
[04:00] <kevb> Anyone on edgy, I need a massive favour. +1000 karma :)
[04:00] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: what's the error you get from the live CD?
[04:00] <josh__> who was the apache guy in here again?
[04:01] <aoupi> josh__: hi
[04:01] <neub> hy guy
[04:01] <coolpaul900> Why does the splash look kinda weird?
[04:01] <josh__> aoupi: what is the file that specifies what port apache will listen on?
[04:01] <sticazzi> I guess I need to edit it and remove that "dot" thing which I have no clue about what it is
[04:01] <neub> i'm looking for a soft to transform mpeg video in avi without compression
[04:01] <rausb0> [ANF] MasterNinja: file- and directorynames are case sensitive, so "install" is not the same as "Install"
[04:01] <mike_> aoupi: Hmm i can't find a line with $PATH in my /home/mike/.bashrc   what about "ln" command? What is the best way of going about this?
[04:01] <coolpaul900> almost darker?
[04:01] <josh__> mike_: you want it to be globally?
[04:02] <josh__> from any user?
[04:02] <mike_> josh__: Yes
[04:02] <josh__> for*
[04:02] <aoupi> josh__: Listen 80 will listen on port 80
[04:02] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: I can get the live cd to boot just fine. It gives me an error when it type: rescue acpi=off. It was a missing file error I believe.
[04:02] <josh__> vim /etc/environment
[04:02] <aoupi> mike_: you can add a line
[04:02] <soundray> sticazzi: just edit that file, insert 'exit 0' as the second line, and try removing again
[04:02] <coolpaul900> Why does my splash look kinda weird? It looks a little darker then normal?
[04:02] <josh__> yeah aoupi, but what file to i make that change in?
[04:02] <aoupi> josh__: httpd.conf
[04:02] <Dimensions> rambo3: ... i do have apache2 mysql and php5 which i installed manually in my ubuntu machine ... while the ubuntu it self was installed like few months ago ... and i did use php apache and mysql a few days ago ... but now i am having this problem ...

[04:03] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: how far do you get when you try booting from the HD?
[04:03] <coolpaul900> Why does my splash look kinda weird? It looks a little darker then normal?
[04:03] <sticazzi> soundray, nice! works now
[04:03] <Joe_SWAU> soundrary: Not very far. It gives me a kernel error. I can reboot to my HD, then boot back into the Live CD, and tell you what the error is exactly.
[04:04] <aoupi> josh__: well you could cd to the directory with httpd.conf and do: grep Listen *
[04:04] <sticazzi> where can I file bug reports? this the third I found related to installation
[04:04] <aoupi> josh__: or just add the Listen line

[04:06] <alnokta> Hello ... I need some help ... I was adjusting "Services" from "System" ... I unticked "D bus service" . when I did that ... the "services-admin" disappeared ..also I cannot access "Right click on desktop menu" ... anyone knows how to undo the stupid thing I made?
[04:06] <josh__> lol next question... who uses dyndns services?
[04:07] <josh__> such as webhop/dynamic dns... whatever
[04:07] <mirak> Andy: the 2.6.17-10 kernel fail to boot, I think it's bound to LVM. by grub menu.lst is ok, but something is wrong with this upgrade from dapper. I had this problem on another computer but it's fixed now, though I don't know how or why.
[04:07] <coolpaul900> mirak, I had the same problem
[04:07] <mirak> I am goind to do a fresh install but that's a waste of time
[04:08] <kevb> jrib: Feel like helping : )
[04:08] <coolpaul900> mirak, did you type aptitude in the terminal and check to see if any was broken?
[04:08] <mike_> aoupi: So now I've added the dir to both bachrc and enviroment /home/mike/myappdir but how what?
[04:08] <mirak> I also can copy that other system to this boot partition since I managed to boot that other harddrive on this box
[04:08] <jrib> kevb: maybe in a bit, doing something else atm
[04:08] <JNeverMind> weee  i got it
[04:08] <sticazzi> should I post these as bugs or are they too minor?
[04:08] <mirak> coolpaul900: lot of problems came during the upgrade
[04:08] <coolpaul900> ya
[04:09] <mike_> aoupi: How do i start my program just by typing "appname" without /dir/dir/appname
[04:09] <kevb> jrib: No problem at all
[04:09] <mirak> CoolBeer: but now it seems to be fixed. Maybe a package like ubuntu-minimal is missing, I will check that
[04:09] <alnokta> nevermind ..
[04:09] <coolpaul900> Mirak: That was my only problem I think..
[04:09] <mirak> coolpaul900: how did yu fixed it ?
[04:09] <ubuntero22> i have a problem installing dapper, when loading i get error such "buffer i/o error" anybody knows how can i solve this? thanks a lot for your help
[04:09] <coolpaul900> go to aptitude in the terminal
[04:10] <coolpaul900> mirak: then look to see if there is any broken packages
[04:10] <aoupi> mike_: it should just work now
[04:10] <LjL> aoupi: you add the directory to your path. export PATH="directory:$PATH" - but your programs should be in standard directories anyway (if you add your own, either /usr/local or /opt)
[04:10] <coolpaul900> <ubuntero22> Do you have enough ram?
[04:10] <ubuntero22> ye
[04:11] <ubuntero22> yes
[04:11] <ubuntero22> actually i dont have the problem in hoary
[04:11] <coolpaul900> how much?
[04:11] <mirak> coolpaul900: aptitude -f is supposed to reveal that
[04:11] <coolpaul900> ok
[04:11] <ubuntero22> 256 mb
[04:11] <jmitchj> could someone help me with this message?..."W: GPG error: http://ubuntu.moshen.de dapper Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY FC0A1CC62F306651"

[04:11] <ubuntero22> when installing hoary i dont have that problem
[04:11] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell jmitchj about gpgerr
[04:11] <josh__> LjL: or u just add it to the /etc/environment file and no export is needed... and its global for all users...
[04:12] <LookTJ> I need help with fonts
[04:12] <Ych> anyone know a good ftp server program?
[04:12] <LjL> josh__: guess so, thanks. still the point about standard paths remains
[04:12] <ubuntero22> but when dapper installer loads (which loads as a live cd) i get that errors
[04:12] <coolpaul900> hmm.. I had that happen to me
[04:12] <josh__> yeah... standard paths are great if you only need it for one user
[04:12] <LookTJ> I got a zip of 6000 fonts, but don't know where to put the fonts
[04:12] <sticazzi> kevb, I can probably remote desktop to myself from the laptop, but no inbound connections - you just need that file, right?
[04:12] <josh__> Ych: proftpd
[04:12] <coolpaul900> Use the alternative disc instaed
[04:12] <FRET> LookTJ, dont install of them
[04:12] <Ych> thankyou josh__
[04:12] <mike_> aoupi: Now it did i just toke like 1 min b4 it did, sorry, Thank you!
[04:13] <LookTJ> FRET: why not?
[04:13] <coolpaul900> ubuntero22> use the alternative disc
[04:13] <LookTJ> I need fonts for gimp :|
[04:13] <LjL> josh__: no i meant putting applications in /opt or /usr/local, rather than changing the path (either for the local user or using /etc/environment)
[04:13] <JNeverMind> do you know a way to confirm im actually in(using) software raid?
[04:13] <ubuntero22> i will try paul.. thanks a lot for your help
[04:13] <kevb> sticazzi: I need that file and I need to know the password for your remote desktop, so it needs to be changed (so you don't give me your password :)
[04:13] <coolpaul900> ur welcome
[04:13] <ubuntero22> you say it worked for you right?
[04:13] <coolpaul900> yep
[04:13] <JNeverMind> mdadm --query --detail /dev/md0
[04:13] <josh__> oh... yeah that is definately safer then changing the path
[04:13] <JNeverMind> STATE: clean
[04:14] <JNeverMind> should i say active ?
[04:14] <mirak> coolpaul900: I have no broken pacakges
[04:14] <JNeverMind> should it say active instead of clean ?
[04:14] <jrib> kevb: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29735/
[04:14] <coolpaul900> <ubuntero22>it might be that you have a problem with your cdrom drive
[04:14] <coolpaul900> hmm
[04:14] <ubuntero22> ok... i will try then, do you know if efty has the same problem? i dont know if downloading dapper or efty
[04:14] <kevb> jrib: Thanks so much
[04:14] <josh__> but in my case i do alot of scripting and testing and such so i have created a /scripts/ directory and just added that to my path to keep my applications seprate from system ones since i use a messed up naming convention also :P
[04:14] <coolpaul900> mirak: is there a solution there?
[04:14] <jrib> kevb: password is foobar by the way
[04:15] <kevb> jrib: nice one!
[04:15] <ubuntero22> well... rare thing is that hoary live cd works.. and same thing with hoary instalator...

[04:18] <atarinox> anybody have an idea why firefox is crashing on me after installing the flash-nonfree plugin?
[04:18] <sami> how i get rid off edgy's bootsplash in startup and shutdown
[04:18] <atarinox> when i try to load a flash page
[04:18] <Joe_SWAU> Hello, I am having problems booting after my laptop crashed during an update. The error I get at boot is : [17179571.21200]  Kernel panic - not syncing : VFS : Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0) [17179571.21200] 
[04:18] <LjL> sami: /boot/grub/menu.lst - remove the "splash" kernel parameter
[04:18] <j2daosh> i left it commented out... my router will block everyone from the outside and any computer has to know the password to log in so im fine
[04:18] <Dimensions> ubuntero22:  i have had some units which couldn't load with ubuntu they had 256 ram and 40 Gb hdd ... but i had to do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and reduce the vga size etc ... they work fine then ...
[04:19] <ubuntero22> yes, thats like my system
[04:19] <j2daosh> Ych: basically all you do is edit your /etc/proftpd.conf file
[04:19] <Ych> ok thanks
[04:19] <variant> i sit just me or is the gnome menu slow to respond?
[04:19] <variant> is it*
[04:19] <ubuntero22> its 256 ram, 80 gb, amd at 1.5 ghz
[04:19] <LookTJ> ych: or install gproftpd
[04:19] <Dimensions> Joe_SWAU: i get the same problem but with installing ubuntu not after updating ...
[04:19] <Ych> and its running all the time, right? @j2daosh
[04:19] <soundray> Since I upgraded to edgy, antialiased fonts look poor in some apps (but not in others). Have you seen this/fixed this?
[04:19] <coolpaul900> ubuntero22: do you have the right disc?
[04:19] <ubuntero22> the easiest thing would be installing the alternate
[04:19] <variant> soundray: I have heard of htis.. dont know what the cause is though
[04:19] <LookTJ> ych: yep
[04:20] <coolpaul900> ubuntero22: Ya much easier
[04:20] <sami> LjL, my kernel line is : /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash, should i remove that last word "splash"
[04:20] <ubuntero22> sorry coolpaul, what you mean with right disk? my english is terrible
[04:20] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: from the live CD, can you mount your root partition and find the file /etc/fstab?
[04:20] <coolpaul900> ubuntero22: do you have one for AMD?
[04:20] <Dimensions> yeah ubuntero22 because alternate one  doesn't load live cd ...should work for you as it did in dozen of times for me ... in many sistuation ...
[04:20] <LjL> sami: yes. possibly "quiet" as well, to get more text output, though i'm not sure

[04:22] <balayhashi> jjss: escolhe-me !
[04:22] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Do I need to mount it from the terminal?
[04:22] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: what's the device name of the partition?

[04:23] <Dimensions> ubuntero22:  if you try alternate ... u wont have any such errors .. i have solved that problem more than dozen times ... with alternate cd ...
[04:23] <ubuntero22> yes... actually didnt happen to me with hoary, rare thing is that using hoary live cd didnt have that error

[04:27] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: do a "cat /mnt/etc/fstab" and put the output on the pastebin (see /topic)
[04:27] <aoupi> j2daosh: I see, gentoo and ubuntu differs in the apache conf then
[04:27] <azarias> xroach,  hm... how did you installed then?? there is a RAM check software on the Boot cd, I would  start a RAM check
[04:28] <aoupi> j2daosh: go into the directory with httpd.conf then: grep DocumentRoot *
[04:28] <j2daosh> yeah, gentoo is more of a "compile it yourself since you think your so special" distro :P
[04:28] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: /topic?
[04:28] <xroach> azarias Used the alternative cd, I had 6.06 and it worked but i decided to go for edgy:D
[04:28] <soundray> MTecknology: if you keep doing the same thing, you will keep getting the same results. Reformulate the question.
[04:28] <aoupi> j2daosh: DocumentRoot is what you want to change. that's gentoo in a nutshell :)

[04:30] <xroach> azarias so anything what I can do for it?
[04:30] <j2daosh> well adding the line didn't work
[04:31] <aoupi> j2daosh: in /etc/apache2 is there only an httpd.conf file or are there more stuff in there?
[04:31] <soundray> Elohimus: could have been fglrx or nvidia-glx
[04:31] <xroach> azarias what should i read from var/log

[04:32] <LjL> sami, if you're afraid of messing up your system, then don't touch menu.lst; simply, when you boot, go into the grub menu, type "e" when you've selected your kernel line, edit it (to remove "splash"), and type "b" to boot. that way, the change will only affect that particular boot, and if it goes wrong, you can just reboot
[04:32] <j2daosh> rebeca: with what?

[04:39] <azureal> LjL, in my attempts to get multiple sound outputs to work simultaneously, i first managed to disable oss, and after the guide it doesnt recognize my sound card at all
[04:39] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: I thought you were installing rather than updating during the powercut. Okay, let's think about your problem again.
[04:39] <livingdaylight> anyone here familiar with Flickr?
[04:39] <angelo> edgy doesn't download the updates...
[04:40] <LjL> angelo, what updates?
[04:40] <livingdaylight> is Flickr cool? what is the Ubuntu consensus?
[04:40] <aoupi> livingdaylight: I find it slow :)
[04:40] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  it aint near as annoying as YouTube. :)
[04:40] <livingdaylight> aoupi: is there an open-source alternative?
[04:40] <Dr_willis> but theres a lot of neat things to do with FLickr
[04:40] <angelo> LjL, there are available updates, but through updates-manager it doesn't download anything
[04:41] <LaR1> can anyone tell me were to get libdvdcss for amd64 ?
[04:41] <engie> livingdaylight: It has a great api
[04:41] <LjL> angelo: indeed, there are some updates from edgy-security. i could tell you how to install them manually -- i don't know why update-manager wouldn't get them, though
[04:41] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: not sure what you mean. I find youtube a great resource :)
[04:41] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Yeah, I was just updating it.
[04:41] <angelo> LjL, it is working to you ?
[04:41] <livingdaylight> aoupi: so, apart from speed it is good?
[04:41] <livingdaylight> engie: api?
[04:41] <LjL> angelo, i don't have Gnome
[04:41] <kevb> has anyone successfully connected to an edgy machine using the vnc server in gnome (Remote Desktop)?
[04:42] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  i find it to be a Cancer on the brains of the masses.. :)
[04:42] <xopher> how do you guys suggest using ps? eg 'ps aux, ps -A' etc, to get the best (most clear) output?
[04:42] <aoupi> livingdaylight: yea, I don't upload anything to it but if it were faster I wouldn't ignore flickr links
[04:42] <angelo> LjL, i know how to install them manually however i think it's a bad issue anyway
[04:42] <dgl> Hi, yesterday I changed my /etc/apt/source.list to edgy and did apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade. After a long download and install everything looks work fine. I turned off my computer and went to bed. Unfortunately, my computer doesnt boot up today. It stops at Running /scripts/init-bottom. Does anybody may help me?
[04:42] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: lol, is that all!?
[04:42] <Ych> is there a way to open a folder on the GUI in root mode?
[04:42] <feliciano> Hi... I have beryl + Xubuntu... But I cant use the AltGr key... Do You know how fix it???
[04:42] <angelo> kevb, i use that often.. it works fine
[04:42] <LjL> angelo: indeed. but not having Gnome, i can't check this out
[04:42] <IndyBC> How do I create a symbolic link?
[04:42] <jpjacobs> Ych, gksudo nautilus (but whatch out what you do)
[04:43] <angelo> Ych, sudo nautilus /path/to/folder
[04:43] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  i also am amazed at how many trademark/copyright/whatever violations are there. :P  Gotta love it when a guys posts a copy of a funny comercial.. then cuts out the last bit an puts his own web site ad there.
[04:43] <LjL> IndyBC: man ln
[04:43] <Ych> thanks
[04:43] <kevb> angelo: I am getting an authentication error using the same config from dapper, now in edgy :S
[04:43] <IndyBC> LjL: ok, thx
[04:43] <Ych> just wanna move a file, too lazy to mv
[04:43] <angelo> kevb, strange
[04:43] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: this 'unknown block' error is odd. Your root partition is okay, otherwise it wouldn't mount just like that. Let's try reinstalling grub.
[04:43] <angelo> edgy doesn't download the updates...
[04:44] <JNeverMind> i have a default install of ubuntu server 606 how could i find out if its apache2.0 or apache 2.2 ?
[04:44] <feryana> Hi guys!!!!
[04:44] <JNeverMind> :q!
[04:44] <feryana> Is possible to extract a webpage (html file) and convert it to pdf??????????'
[04:44] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: have you got the live CD booted?
[04:44] <feryana> I tried to force it but no way
[04:44] <Joe_SWAU> The error comes right after it uncomresses the linux kernel.
[04:44] <sticazzi> feryana, it's possible to print it
[04:45] <feryana> yeah I remeber
[04:45] <aoupi> JNeverMind: go to http://127.0.0.1/ThisDoesNotExist
[04:45] <feryana> cool thanks
[04:45] <feryana> i think that I have the software
[04:45] <feryana> on printers
[04:45] <aoupi> JNeverMind: look at the server info there
[04:45] <engie> livingdaylight: For fiddling with your photos from python! I've put together a couple of fun little tools
[04:45] <feryana> with postscript???
[04:45] <feryana> I dont find the file
[04:45] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: d'you hear the news about myspace? they gonna use this software that apple uses so people can't use illegal media
[04:46] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Yes, I have the live CD booted, but the error comes after grub has done it's thing, and the linux kernel is uncompressed. (It is the line right after that uncompressing linux kernel message.
[04:46] <sontek> Do you guys know if there is a better way of refreshing the gnome network manager wireless networks than restarting dbus?
[04:47] <feryana> sticazzi how I do that??? I thought that was with postscript, but I don't find the file
[04:47] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: my suspicion is that grub is using a wrong root parameter to the kernel. Do you want to try my suggestion? The other thing you could do is let me have a look at your /boot/grub/menu.lst (on pastebin)
[04:48] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Ok.
[04:48] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: that's /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst if you've mounted the HD from the live CD
[04:48] <termleech> can anyone help me getting dual head set up under fglrx and ubuntu edgy for xorg
[04:48] <termleech> i'm banging my head here
[04:49] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: How do I open that file?
[04:49] <snoops> feryana yep, quite a few html to pdf converters about.. not sure of anything in specific... but googling for html to pdf linux is a start. I made a small html to pdf converter for a project once..but it was specific to them
[04:49] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  yea.. i imagine the disaster that will be.. :) since from what ive seen all the  'legal' videos are peoples home movies of their pets.
[04:49] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: What text editor do I use?
[04:49] <Flats> In my smb.conf file. I want allow all PC's on the 192.168.1.XXX network. What should my hosts allow format look like? 192.168.1?

[04:49] <dgl> Hi, yesterday I changed my /etc/apt/source.list to edgy and did apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade. After a long download and installation everything looks work fine. I turned off my computer and went to bed. Unfortunately, my computer does not boot up today. It stops at Running /scripts/init-bottom. Does anybody may help me?
[04:50] <feryana> snoops, I can print it into a pdf file, but I don't see the pdf printer I can see "Make a pdf file" but doesn't appear on the print options of firefox
[04:50] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: cat /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst will display the file in the terminal
[04:51] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: indeed, that'll be all thats left. As all the music and legal stuff won't be allowed. Welcome to the DRM  generation!
[04:51] <dob1> can the ubuntu installer boot and recognize a sata hdd ?
[04:51] <dob1> i have some problem with it
[04:51] <snoops> Dr_willis, on youtube there's about 2 or 3 people I regularly watch, and they're witty, intelligent, and provide a great piece of entertainment..it's the same with blogs.. Most blogs suck, as do most home videos.. if you spend awhile finding the good stuff, it's well worth it
[04:51] <Cyril__> hi
[04:52] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29742/
[04:52] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  personally ive been going to the 'adult swim' site - and watching shows legally. :) better quality also.
[04:52] <aoupi> livingdaylight: more like: welcome to the piracy generation
[04:52] <feryana> I think I got it
[04:52] <Ych> hmmmm i get an error when i try to run openftpd:  - IPv6 getaddrinfo 'localhost' error: Name or service not known
[04:52] <Ych> anyone know what this means?
[04:52] <livingdaylight> aoupi: piractes are being exterminated
[04:52] <aoupi> Ych: that shouldn't matter
[04:53] <feryana> is firefox fault, coz with Konqueror I can do it
[04:53] <Ych> ok good
[04:53] <xamox> if a package went into a config mode when I did an apt-get install, how can I make that config pop up again. I know I have done it before, but I don't remember the command
[04:53] <Dr_willis> snoops,  bah! i spend all my time exploring "SecondLive" trying to find ANYTHING worth doing on it.  :)
[04:53] <aoupi> livingdaylight: no, not even close
[04:53] <Ych> thanks aoupi
[04:53] <Cyril__> I upgrade to edgy using the edgy install CD, an internet connection and the 'gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" ' command, but it stops while downloading
[04:53] <rausb0> xamox: dpkg-reconfigure packagename
[04:54] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: nothing obviously wrong in there. Do a 'sudo grub' and enter 'root (hd0,0)', then 'setup (hd0)'
[04:54] <xamox> rausb0:  alright, thx.
[04:54] <Stusio> hi all
[04:54] <Cyril__> how can I continue ?
[04:54] <snoops> Dr_willis oh gosh..I've been fighting an urge to get into secondlife
[04:55] <Dr_willis> snoops,  i read a artical about the Weather Service (NOAA) having a neat second life 'exibit' so i go .. and cant find it...
[04:55] <livingdaylight> aoupi: then i'm hanging out with the wrong crowd! can i join your gang? :p
[04:55] <Dr_willis> snoops,  its amazing what a mess it is.
[04:55] <aoupi> livingdaylight: sure :)
[04:55] <Dr_willis> snoops,  the Linux SecondLife client seems to work  decently for me however.
[04:55] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: It says it succeeded.
[04:55] <Stusio> who can help me whit eciadsl?
[04:55] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: great. Type quit and reboot from the HD.
[04:56] <aoupi> livingdaylight: I'll stop pirating when I can buy movies cheaply that are high quality and no DRM, same for music
[04:56] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: checking out adult swim site - a first -hrmmm
[04:56] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Ok, thanks will do.
[04:56] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  yea the 'adult swim fix' is the site that has the shows..
[04:56] <xopher> fast question, how can I extract all the zip files in a dir with one command?
[04:56] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,   it should work if ya got all the right plugins/packages/players installed. :)
[04:56] <soundray> xopher: for i in *.zip ; do unzip $i ; done
[04:56] <Dr_willis> xopher,  unzip "*.zip"
[04:57] <feryana> snoops. I got it, is easy, you must browse with Konqueror, then just click on print and select "To a PDF file" and wuala! I don't know if is my faoult or firefox's but on it, I can't do it
[04:57] <Dr_willis> i think also works.. unzip was one of the FEW programs ive seen that use wildcards that way. (or it used to)
[04:57] <snoops> cool feryana
[04:57] <rausb0> Dr_willis: it does. however, this is very un-unixish
[04:57] <xopher> thanks
[04:57] <feryana> take it for your notes if someone ask in the future :)
[04:57] <CarinArr> hey, is anyone else having problems with azureus being EXTREMELY slow? i haven't really used it before so i'm not sure if it's normal
[04:58] <Dr_willis> rausb0,  yea.. it suprised me also. :P
[04:58] <feryana> this gonna save me tones of ink :D
[04:58] <CarinArr> and i'm not talking download speeds.. it's been checking a file tht was part downloaded for over an hour
[04:58] <aoupi> CarinArr: it uses lots of RAM, if you don't have lots of ram it'll be very slow
[04:58] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: hrmmm....tricky...what do i need?
[04:58] <CarinArr> i have a gig..
[04:58] <josh__> whats up guys (and girls)? i need to fix my fstab and my mounts so that people other then root can read/write/execute stuff on a disk i use for backups
[04:59] <josh__> it is owned by root and devplug is the group
[04:59] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  well im not sure.. I isntalled a bunch of players/xine/mplayer/vlc/plugins and w32codecs on edgy.. then noticed the site worked. :) on my old dapper install i never did get it working
[04:59] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell josh__, about windowsdrives don't be misled by the fact that this focuses on Windows partition - it should contain the information you need
[04:59] <LjL> whops

[05:00] <samu2> What commands can you use to format a disk?
[05:00] <rausb0> Dr_willis: zip/unzip are not exactly unix tools. they were developed as a GPL'd alternative to pkzip/pkunzip under ms-dos.
[05:00] <LjL> samu2: man mkfs
[05:00] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: well, i do have w32codecs and totem-xine with libxine-extracodecs but so far nothing is working
[05:00] <samu2> LjL ok, i'll check it out, thanks
[05:00] <Dr_willis> livingdaylight,  im not even sure what the site plays with onmy system - let me see
[05:02] <livingdaylight> Dr_willis: one of them is not liking my version of flash. but i haven't got my head round upgrading to flash9beta and using the ole regular flash7 is it?

[05:05] <LjL> mcayland, have you installed a third-party version of firefox?

[05:05] <ACSpike[Work] > is there anywhere I can find a current status of network-manager with wpa as it relates to edgy?

[05:06] <LjL> mcayland, actually, i believe you have enabled Universe but not in the edgy-updates and edgy-security repositories, so the versions now mismatch

[05:15] <Ych> whats a good code editor, with colors and the like, but not in console, since i like to use my mouse?
[05:15] <jmeunier> OK quick question, how can you set up virtual memory or disk swap?
[05:15] <LjL> soundray: and additionally it *should* also work graphically using svgalib or the framebuffer or DirectFB, although here by default it doesn't really
[05:15] <feg> jmeunier, mkswap
[05:15] <atarinox> What about Epiphany? how would that work for xfce?

[05:15] <atarinox> should I stick to gtk?

[05:16] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: have you got an older kernel in the grub menu?
[05:16] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: I don't know.
[05:16] <feg> aragorn_elessar, or better...comment them
[05:17] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: hold on...
[05:17] <aragorn_elessar> feg: hi! But in this way ubuntu doesn't mount them at all...
[05:17] <LjL> atarinox, i'd try, in order of preference, dillo / links2 -g / epiphany, i think
[05:17] <atarinox> ah. well i'm having trouble getting this firefox flash plugin to work...keeps crashing on me...so i'm hoping switching browsers might solve it
[05:17] <feg> aragorn_elessar, yup! if you want them available but not visible on the desktop, maybe there a gconf entry to do that
[05:18] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: From this point I would be able to back up documents and the like though. Correct? Since the drive is mounted. I would be able to go in and back up document 'n the like to a usb drive, or floppy drivers or what ever.
[05:18] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: yes, you do. In the grub menu, select the third option. If that works, try the dpkg -i command I gave you earlier
[05:18] <Joe_SWAU> From the Live CD menu?
[05:18] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: yes, you can do that.
[05:18] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: no, from the HD boot grub menu
[05:18] <psychic> Will Feisty have better support for USB modems?
[05:19] <LjL> atarinox: then the kind of things we've suggested are probably not a good solution for your problem (but then i feel you misstated your problem a little)
[05:19] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: I don't get a boot menu.

[05:19] <mcayland> LjL: Yup looks like it's working. Thanks very much!
[05:19] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: It just boots. As far as I can tell.
[05:19] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: watch the boot messages, there should be something like "Press ESC for grub menu"
[05:20] <mirak> is there graphicall differences between ubuntu and debian or are all gui tools common to both distributions ?
[05:20] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Ahh.., ok. So the third selection.
[05:20] <atarinox> yeah. well everything seems in order, i'm using the flash 9.0 beta plugin, and the about:plugins agrees...dont know waht the problem is

[05:21] <aragorn_elessar> feg: now I search , thanks for the answer!

[05:24] <Ayabara_> someone helped me find a patch to the kernel in dapper that doesn't seem to be in edgy. I use a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop with media keys on the front. when I plug in headphones I want the media keys to control headphone volume instead of speaker volume. this doesn't work in edgy.
[05:24] <Ayabara_> puhh. that was a bad explanation. anyone understand?

[05:24] <quintin> How do I make firefox not so slow?
[05:25] <soundray> LjL: cool
[05:25] <ACETACE> quick question... for hardcore grep users.... what should be a pattern string that matches any ip address for grep?
[05:25] <Nickle0de0n> engie: I'd need to do more i presume- splitting it so that i can write it to 700MB cds.
[05:25] <Nickle0de0n> the source file is in avi- i think mpeg4
[05:25] <abze> how can i install opera 9.03 when apt-get tels me i have the newest, and i have 9.00 installed?
[05:26] <soundray> xopher: *.r[0-9] [0-9] 
[05:26] <jpjacobs> hi! i've made a .deb myself, how can i have dpkg add some dir to the users $PATH when installing the package?
[05:26] <ACETACE> abze, i think you have to wait for the latest opera to be added in the pool?
[05:26] <abze> ok thanx ace
[05:26] <pianoboy3333> jpjacobs: you don't
[05:26] <HeathenDan> abze, 9.03 isn't out yet. and there is always lag between release and availability in repositories
[05:26] <abze> ok, thought so
[05:26] <pianoboy3333> jpjacobs: you declare how the deb installs when compiling the deb
[05:26] <ryjax> hello all
[05:27] <xopher> soundray, *bows*
[05:27] <soundray> jpjacobs: that's not recommended. Make your package install executables to standard paths
[05:27] <ACETACE> quick question... for hardcore regEX users.... what should be a pattern string that matches any ip address for grep?
[05:27] <abze> maybe i can find it out there in another formate then ;) like some tarball thingy?
[05:27] <HeathenDan> if you can't wait, opera always has .deb files for you... cause even their repositories can take days before updating
[05:28] <asbo> a question regarding the install on edgy
[05:28] <abze> ill use google and see what i find, hope its not to hard to install
[05:28] <asbo> can i killall this dosfsck as its been running for 1 and a half hours
[05:28] <pianoboy3333> Does anyone know where I can pick up debs for gaim 2.0.0 beta 4?
[05:28] <asbo> and will it fuck my install if i do

[05:29] <asbo> a little frustrated sorry
[05:29] <HeathenDan> does the installer run dosfsck? i didn't notice if it did
[05:29] <quintin> yea, somehow I doubt there are any little kids in here

[05:34] <quintin> skmidry: search on ubuntuforums.org for '/etc/resolv.conf'

[05:34] <quintin> oh my god
[05:34] <quintin> you say 'please' to the bot.
[05:34] <quintin> fdl
[05:34] <Drac|School> Actually, I know where the kernel module is. I need to know where the X module is.
[05:34] <LjL> soundray, xopher: definitely agreed, when we're talking about shell fiddling.
[05:34] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Thanks. :-) Bye. :-)
[05:35] <soundray> Joe_SWAU: I think so, too. If all else fails, you can always boot into -26 again
[05:35] <xopher> Allright, going to have a look at ABS then. Thanks again
[05:35] <LjL> quintin: fdl?
[05:35] <Joe_SWAU> soundray: Hehe, yeah. I think it just powered down during the kernel update. ;-)

[05:36] <quintin> errr: there is an alternate install disc.  not sure if the regular one has text-only or not
[05:37] <soundray> Cheers guys
[05:37] <quintin> errr: you could also try to configure x then restart it
[05:37] <errr> soundray: what if I have fc5 on it now, is it possible to d/l something minimal and do a net type install?
[05:37] <LjL> quintin, i still don't know what fdl means. if it's an insult, though, perhaps keep it to yourself next time...

[05:42] <quintin> LjL: I don't think they are mounted rw by default in ubuntu with mount command.  not 100% sure
[05:42] <keescook> kevb: what can I help with?
[05:42] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: glxinfo | grep Rendering
[05:42] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: thx
[05:42] <LjL> quintin: could be, in that case it'd be a documentation bug though
[05:42] <quintin> still no one tells me how to make firefox not totally suck
[05:43] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: it just goes on to the next line
[05:43] <erUSUL> Drac|School: i have the same driver instaled here (with a custom kernel though) and see no complaints from X... the nvidia instaler should have replaced both
[05:43] <kevb> keescook: I wasn't sure what the thread was saying. I don't know if it is fixed or not and how to apply said fix.
[05:43] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: glx info | grep ender
[05:43] <keescook> kevb: a fix was discovered, and is making its way through the "stable release" channels now.
[05:43] <Drac|School> erUSUL: X launches without complaints when I first install it, but after reboot it has this problem
[05:43] <optimusprime> I'm trying to update and I can't...."sudo apt-get" doesn't work
[05:43] <kevb> keescook: any way to apply it now?
[05:44] <ACETACE> LjL, YESS it works~~~~~ thanks
[05:44] <eXSiR> may be it is "glxinfo | grep render"
[05:44] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: "glx info | grep render" command not found
[05:44] <keescook> kevb: if you want to recompile it yourself, you can use the attached "debdiff".  have you done package builds before?
[05:44] <Human_Prototype> how long is the timeout on freenode? i cant sign in as my normal user as my username is already in use
[05:44] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: there is no space, you donkey.  enter it like I told you to
[05:44] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: oops!  I put in a space
[05:45] <eXSiR> may be it is "glxinfo | grep render" :))
[05:45] <quintin> heh, I'm off today
[05:45] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: i did it both ways eehh oorrr
[05:45] <kevb> keescook: I tried to do it earlier, I didn't use the diff debdiff I just commented line 309 in vino_prefs.c - it didn't work : )
[05:45] <Drac|School> erUSUL: It even compiles the kernel module itself... I don't understand why it doesn't stick.
[05:45] <erUSUL> Drac|School: the only problem i encounterd was that i had to move the config file from $HOME to /etc/X11/ manually
[05:45] <quintin> what eXSiR is saying will work.
[05:45] <optimusprime> how do get a user to be "sudoer"
[05:45] <Drac|School> erUSUL: That might do it.
[05:46] <keescook> kevb: the reason is that there are patches to that area already, so the build probably failed.
[05:46] <law_> optimusprime:  just type sudo ?
[05:46] <quintin> optimusprime: add them to the 'admin' group or whatever.  system > admin > users
[05:46] <earthian> optimusprime v'isudo'
[05:46] <Drac|School> erUSUL: Which config file?
[05:46] <earthian> er
[05:46] <earthian> soz 'visudo'
[05:46] <kevb> keescook: I applied the current patches, modified the source then built with dpkg-buildpackage, it built the package...
[05:46] <erUSUL> Drac|School: xorg.conf
[05:46] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: so do you have DRI?
[05:46] <optimusprime> yeah I can't....'cause I don't seem'em......
[05:46] <optimusprime> and sudo doesn't seem to work...
[05:46] <kevb> keescook: I've started wondering if I have a different issue altogether and maybe my build worked.
[05:46] <law_> hi i got a problem i configured svn and want to connect with ssh , he connects and asks me for a password , but when i type it in he just asks me again (without error msg)
[05:46] <keescook> kevb: do this:   cd /tmp; apt-get source vino; cd vino-*; patch -p1 < /path/to/debdiff; debuild -uc -us; sudo dpkg -i ../vino*.deb
[05:47] <law_> i tried to use the password db but it dont works
[05:47] <Drac|School> erUSUL: That's nutty. My Xorg.conf is configured to use the nvidia module, and as long as yours was it should have worked. Copying it makes no sense. -.o
[05:47] <optimusprime> I meant that I can't see the system admin thingy....
[05:47] <keescook> kevb: after the install, you'll have to restart your session, and hopefully that'll fix it.
[05:47] <kevb> keescook: Thanks, I'm gonna try that now. Much appreciated :)
[05:47] <erUSUL> Drac|School: for some reason i do not understand the nvidia instaler does not update the xorg.conf (it creates one in your home) and when you reboot the machine bang!!
[05:47] <keescook> kevb: okay, good luck!
[05:47] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: no direct rendering, I already tried the "fglrx" driver and it would only work if I put libGL.so.1.2 in /usr/lib...although then it stopped working again! I seen a similar bug of launchpad
[05:47] <quintin> optimusprime: ehm.. hm?
[05:47] <earthian> optimusprime use 'visudo' command then enter the username down there near root and use the same form as root is entered there..
[05:47] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: Hah! :P
[05:47] <kevb> keescook: ty, gtg but thanks
[05:48] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: I've been trying for some time to get DRI on i810 with no success.  sux, eh
[05:48] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: yeah
[05:48] <erUSUL> Drac|School: mine was configured to my old radeon card and the instaler did not update it properly as i said
[05:48] <TooTallJones> Why is my new Geforce 7600 GS 512MB graphics card only coming up as Nvidia Default card in my xorg.conf on my xubuntu/edgy? =(
[05:48] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: which video card?
[05:48] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: radeon 9250
[05:49] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: mm.  I think nvidia are easiest to setup for dri.  I do not do this sort of thing much though
[05:49] <Paddy_EIRE> quintin: I wish ati would take their finger out their a*s and sort this out
[05:49] <Drac|School> erUSUL: Ah. I never told it to update my Xorg.conf. I figured changing the driver to "nvidia" manually was enough. I just reinstalled and let it do its thing. I'll reboot now.
[05:49] <optimusprime> is it normal for a user not to see the "admin" stuff?....like GDM....Users and Groups
[05:50] <quintin> Paddy_EIRE: it would be nice.  only thing you can do is write a letter or talk with your $$$ and buy intel or nvidia :(
[05:50] <eXSiR> optimusprime: are you a super user?

[05:58] <lagshot> ey: that would be dandy, thanks for asking. I'm using the latest xubuntu live disk, and i'm curious if theres a way to specify using reiserfs for my / instead of ext3?
[05:58] <leafw> Admiral_Chicago : about 5 year old powermac

[05:58] <leafw> LjL : thanks, the /proc/cpuinfo list it all
[05:58] <leafw> yes, not a 64 for sure, but could be dual 500MHz
[05:58] <Wilmer> are there dapper install images with a newer linux kernel available or shall i try to make one myself? :-/
[05:58] <leafw> actually, /proc/cpuinfo says "0" processor

[06:00] <leafw> the System Preferences Device Manager should list i all, it does.

[06:07] <IcemanV9> Admiral_Chicago: no. will do now.

[06:34] <nitalaut> hello guys. i've a little problem - i can't save some of my setting(i'm using 6.10 as desktop) - for example i can create new panel and drag icons there
[06:34] <nitalaut> but afetr logoff and log on it is emty
[06:34] <LjL> attilio: ah, that's it. you have a proxy set -- i wonder why. type   export HTTP_PROXY=""
=== mepa|Yancho is now known as Yancho
[06:34] <tapas> http_proxy
[06:35] <tapas> should be lowercase, no?
[06:35] <LjL> attilio: then try again the sudo apt-get update, it should work. but this is only a temporary patch, you need to find out where and why you have a proxy set
[06:35] <rga> how do install PHP, Apache and mysql in Edgy?
[06:35] <attilio> LjL, with sudo before?
[06:35] <tapas> [one of the few env vars which are lowercase] 
[06:35] <Yancho> How can I login - the first time - as a root in ubuntu pls ?
[06:35] <nitalaut> Yancho, don't do this )
[06:35] <nitalaut> use sudo
[06:35] <LjL> tapas: you have a point, though he does have it set to localhost:4001 in the uppercase version
[06:35] <LjL> attilio: no
[06:35] <LjL> attilio: try typing "echo $http_proxy" as well
[06:36] <Yancho> thanks nitalaut
[06:36] <tapas> LjL: ah ok, i didn't follow the discussion previously. was a shot in the dark :)
[06:36] <nitalaut> try sudo bash
[06:36] <Yancho> and how can i know what is the ip set on the pc? :)
[06:36] <tapas> LjL: maybe some programs use the uppercase version
[06:36] <nitalaut> and you'll get a root shell
[06:36] <tapas> sudo su
[06:36] <tapas> is good, too :)
=== alec is now known as alecjw
[06:36] <LjL> aaagh sudo bash and sudo su
[06:36] <nitalaut> or just su -
[06:36] <nitalaut> ))
[06:36] <Yancho> a cool :) phew .. i though im logged out lol
[06:36] <LjL> please use "sudo -i" for that
[06:36] <gottreu> does #ubuntu+1 not exist right now since eft was jsut released?
[06:36] <tapas> nitalaut: hehe ;)
[06:36] <tapas> su - won't work no ubuntu
[06:36] <attilio> LjL, btw I've tried export HTTP_PROXY="" and then sudo apt-get update, but it does'nt work :((
[06:37] <LjL> gottreu: good guess
[06:37] <samu2> I posted a description of my problem on the ubuntu forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1697896#post1697896 Could someone check it out please? The answer i got tells me to use the live desktop CD and use gparted. But one of the problems was that the live CD doesn't work for me. Can't I just open a terminal in rescue mode and format it with some command?
[06:37] <nitalaut> yeah ??
[06:37] <LjL> attilio: same errors?
[06:37] <nitalaut> i didn't knew
[06:37] <mirak> when I do apt-get build-dep mythtv it says depencies can't be resolved
[06:37] <Flamekebab> hmm, is it possible to rip audio from SWF files?
[06:37] <Fastly> what's coming next after edgy?
[06:37] <tapas> which is a clue to the answer to the original question
[06:37] <brenlae> tapas, sudo root passwd
[06:37] <LjL> nitalaut: just "su -" shouldn't even work
[06:37] <LjL> !root | brenlae, tapas
[06:37] <ubotu> brenlae, tapas: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:37] <nitalaut> guys it works
[06:37] <nitalaut> i've just checked )
[06:37] <nitalaut> su -
[06:37] <nitalaut> and my root password
[06:37] <tapas> LjL: man, i know what sudo does :)
[06:37] <attilio> LjL, quite the same, I'll paste it
[06:37] <nitalaut> and i became a root
[06:37] <LjL> nitalaut: that's because you have a root password set. you shouldn't have, on a normal Ubuntu install.
[06:37] <tapas> nitalaut: yes, if you have a root password, but this is ubuntu
[06:37] <tapas> )
[06:38] <alecjw> i've just crashed x; when i try to start it, it says that a security file or something's missing, can anyone help me please?
[06:38] <nitalaut> ah)
[06:38] <mirak> how can I know the build-deps for mythtv or a package ?
[06:38] <nitalaut> yeah i have set it
[06:38] <brenlae> no need to use su anyhow
[06:38] <gottreu> so does eft support 32- and 64-bit packages in parallel?  or was that put off for a later release?
[06:38] <nitalaut> sudo is better certainly
[06:38] <tapas> sudo su is useful to not have to type sudo on ebery command
[06:38] <LjL> tapas: i'm sure, but i was seeing blanket advice to use "su" and set a root password. which shouldn't be given without disclaimers and explanations to alternative possibilities (i.e. using "sudo" like Ubuntu intends people to)
[06:38] <chad> im trying to boot a winxp install in vmware from a Physical Partition ..following this guide: http://news.u32.net/articles/2006/07/18/running-vmware-on-a-physical-partition, the disk is a SATA disk..and there seems to be a problem with the drivers ..  i get as far as the "winxp loading logo" then i get a bluescreen.."remove new hw"
[06:39] <H0110Wman> L
[06:39] <nitalaut> terrible, so many questions what a mess!
[06:39] <LjL> tapas: no, "sudo -i" is useful for that. "sudo su" doesn't make much sense, since you're invoking two essentially similar commands chained, with no need for that
[06:39] <nitalaut> a lot of people use ubuntu ))
[06:39] <tapas> LjL: i didn't tell anyone to set a root password. i was justhinting at ubuntu's "quirk" to not set a root pw.. but minor important
[06:39] <LjL> mirak: apt-get build-dep <package>
[06:39] <Dimensions> how do i install mysql with sudo apt-get install
[06:39] <tapas> LjL: right
[06:39] <nitalaut> Dimensions, sudo apt-get install mysql-server -)
[06:39] <attilio> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29760/
[06:39] <mirak> LjL: what do you have for mythtv ? for it fails, it says it can't resolve deps
[06:39] <LjL> tapas: no, but brenlae did - if you notice, the bot factoid was addressed to both of you
[06:39] <nitalaut> like this i suppose
[06:40] <attilio> LjL, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29760/
[06:40] <tapas> LjL: yah, i was just wondering why at me, too :)
[06:40] <tapas> LjL: btw; i like sudo su 's quirkyness :)
[06:40] <rga> how do i install PHP, Apache and mysql in Edgy?
[06:40] <LjL> mirak: because you were suggesting sudo su and similar
[06:40] <mirak> LjL: can you past me the list of deps ?
[06:40] <DiMiTRiS> How do i backup dvds in ubuntu? Does libdvdcss2 bypass all protection on dvds such as bad sectors and invalid structure protection???
[06:40] <LjL> mirak:  dpatch libavc1394-dev libdts-dev libdvb-dev libdvdnav-dev libiec61883-0 libiec61883-dev libimlib2-dev libjack0.100.0-dev liblame-dev liblame0 liblircclient-dev libmysqlclient15-dev libraw1394-dev libungif4-dev libxv-dev libxvmc-dev libxxf86vm-dev texi2html x11proto-video-dev x11proto-xf86vidmode-dev
[06:40] <nitalaut> rga aptitude install apache 2 php4 mysql-server libapache2-mod-php4
[06:40] <tapas> like with all tools, the default setting of no passwrd makes sense in many situations..
[06:41] <LjL> mirak: do you have the *source* repositories enabled, for Universe and Multiverse as well?
[06:41] <mirak> LjL: thanks
[06:41] <mirak> LjL: I guess, but I am checking
[06:41] <tapas> it can run astray though i.e. if your computer forgets the date and sudo is a bit picky about timestamps
[06:42] <Dimensions> i have reinstalled mysql-server but when i type mysql -u user -p and type my passwd after it ask it ..i get this error ... ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'filter'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
[06:42] <mirak> deb-src http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy main restricted universe multiverse
[06:42] <mirak> LjL: I have it
[06:42] <candyban> Hi guys
[06:42] <tapas> Dimensions: mysql has its own user database
[06:42] <clearzen> where does ubuntu store the programs it uses during startup?
[06:42] <rga> nitalaut apache 2 or apache2 no space?
[06:42] <LjL> tapas: see, i'm not arguing for or against sudo, i'm just saying that it's the supported default in Ubuntu, so people should be adviced to use that (and the proper "sudo -i" command to become root for a longer time) instead being told to set a root password. the !sudo factoid is useful, since it links to a page that explains it all, and
[06:42] <nitalaut> rga, apache2
[06:42] <dkr> clearzen: /etc/init.d
[06:42] <tapas> Dimensions: your normal pw won't work.. take a look at some mysql tutorial
[06:42] <candyban> Are there some known problems with the edgy kernel and usb ?
[06:42] <rga> nitalaut thanks
[06:43] <clearzen> dkr: thanks
[06:43] <LjL> tapas: and *also* explains how to enable root, while making it clear that you should know what you're doing if you do that
[06:43] <candyban> My linux box won't boot anymore since it upgraded from dapper to edgy
[06:43] <mirak> LjL: E: Build-dependencies for mythtv could not be satisfied.
[06:43] <LjL> mirak: have you run a sudo apt-get update?
[06:43] <candyban> Are there some kernel options I can provide to skip usb?
[06:43] <Dimensions> tapas i had created my user filter ... and i know its password too .. it also says using password yes ...
[06:44] <LjL> attilio, sorry, i missed your last paste. try also   export $http_proxy=""
[06:44] <LjL> attilio, sorry, i missed your last paste. try also   export http_proxy=""   <-- i meant
[06:44] <mirak> LjL: yes I do that from a root shell
[06:44] <nitalaut> Dimensions, try logging in with user root and emty password
[06:44] <nitalaut> empty
[06:44] <LjL> mirak, *shrugh*, don't know why it says that. you have the binary repositories for universe and multiverse enabled as well, i suppose. i think you could just try running "apt-get install list-of-packages-i-gave-you"
[06:44] <Dimensions> nitalaut:  i can login as root ...
[06:45] <attilio> LjL, thanks it works! Great!!!!
[06:45] <nitalaut> ah
[06:45] <nitalaut> so why don't you use something like GRANT ALL on *.* to etc
[06:45] <Yancho> how can i set up my ip on the server . .. since it is 10.0.0.1 and this pc is 10.0.0.1 too lol - and i need to download webmin
[06:45] <LjL> attilio: yeah, now you need to find out where your proxy is set. if you're using Gnome, i can't be of much help, since i use KDE, but there should be something under System / Preferences or System / administration -- see if it's set
[06:45] <Johnny-K> hello all, got a bit of a problem trying to connect to the internet. The problem occured once I'd clicked on getting the latest upgrades for edgy (installed on the beta). Intenet was working before then however. I've posted the problem on the forums but I just wanted to see if anyone had any ideas how to solve this, the url for the thread is here: http://www.ubuntuforum.com/showthread.php?t=288202
[06:45] <Johnny-K> &highlight=sagem
[06:45] <Dimensions> umm ... i had given permission to my user before ..
[06:45] <b08y> hey does anyone know why, nautilus cant move files to trash, if im at an different partion than the /
[06:46] <mirak> LjL: yes I will do that
[06:46] <LjL> attilio: i'd also try a     grep --binary-file=without-match "http_proxy\|HTTP_PROXY" ~
[06:46] <Lemino> please help med embed openoffice in firefox. it's possible trough mozplugger, but I don't know how.
[06:47] <mirak> apt-get autoremove doesn't work
[06:47] <mirak> that's always non sens
[06:47] <mirak> it tries to remove packages you really don't want to remove
[06:47] <LjL> mirak: really? like?
[06:48] <mirak> apt-get build-dep gxine        this wants to remove kernel-headers, and vdr-dev
[06:48] <erikgz> say i just deleted my boot partition (rm -rf /boot/*).  how do i restore it?  i'm having trouble getting grub to reinstall because i can't figure out how to regen the stage{1,2} files
[06:48] <LjL> attilio: i'd also try a     grep --binary-file=without-match "http_proxy\|HTTP_PROXY" ~/*     <-- i meant
[06:48] <thinkgreen> hi there, i've got a bit of a networking problem if anyone wants to take a crack at it
[06:48] <asbo> go ahead thinkgreen
[06:48] <LjL> mirak: hm, but isn't that because of a conflict, rather than because of the autoremove feature?
[06:48] <attilio> LjL, nothing
[06:49] <ey> hello what command allowes me to check how many users on my computer???
[06:49] <Lemino> openoffice in firefox, anyone?
[06:49] <thinkgreen> alright, so for some reason my network device randomly loses its ip address,  I'm not running a dhcp server i just assign them manually
[06:49] <LjL> attilio: not in the second version either? (the first one was wrong, sorry)
[06:49] <mirak> LjL: apt-get install -f doesn't mention any conflict
[06:49] <asbo> ey: who
[06:49] <asbo> ey: is the command
[06:49] <mirak> LjL: well it's not the first time it's trying to do weird things
[06:49] <asbo> ey: or simply w will do
[06:49] <SLuG> hello, i'm having a few problems with my recently upgraded dapper->edgy install. i can't seem to remote desktop (vnc just gives me a black screen with a mouse) and my wireless has an odd quirk, and i'm also having trouble with tsclient trying to connect to another machine.
[06:49] <thedude> anyone know ifi t is possible to run two video cards in one machine and possibly switch back/forth or have both?
[06:49] <ey> thanks

[06:50] <mirak> LjL: when I install the package to build mythtv it also tries to remvoe them
[06:50] <asbo> ey: no problem
[06:50] <attilio> LjL, yes with the second one it doesn't match anything

[06:51] <asbo> yancho: sudo apt-get install <name>
[06:51] <Paddy_EIRE> oh
[06:51] <TritonX> paddy : nano is gedit for terminal
[06:51] <thinkgreen> asbo: so after a period of time an ifconfig shows that the device just doens't have and ip address, i have to deactivate/reactive it with the gui, then it works fine for a while
[06:51] <Paddy_EIRE> ok
[06:51] <erikgz> packages.ubuntu.com is basically non-functioning atm.  any ideas about stage1 and stage2?
[06:51] <crimsun> erikgz: copy them from /lib/grub/i386-pc/

[06:52] <aMicke> Hi, i have some weird problems with my wirless card... The drivers, ipw3945 are installed and i can find networks but when i try to connect to my network i get "connection failed" even if the network is open, not encrypted, I have searched in the foums and on google but haven't been able to find an answear so please help me.
[06:52] <Paddy_EIRE> TritonX: so I will reboot into recovery mode
[06:52] <maxb_at_work> After an upgrade from Dapper to Edgy, I have a *lot* of xserver-xorg-driver-* packages remaining installed for which there is no version in Edgy. Does anyone know why that is?
[06:52] <TritonX> paddy: and find fglrx and change it to ATI, it might not work though ... I have no experience with ATI card
[06:52] <crimsun> maxb_at_work: we obsoleted them with xserver-xorg-video-*
[06:52] <asbo> thinkgreen: cable / adsl / wireless?
[06:52] <SLuG> amicke i think i'm having a similar problem
[06:52] <LjL> attilio: look, i don't know where those variables might have been set, and i wouldn't know where to look at in gnome (assuming it's gnome that set them)...  try going to a real console (i.e. ctrl+alt+f2, ctrl+alt+f7 to get back) and type "echo $http_proxy" and see if it's there too
[06:52] <TritonX> paddy: yep , in revoery mode you can repair everything

[06:53] <asbo> um
[06:53] <boguh> hi, is there a flash player 9 package for ubuntu?
[06:53] <crimsun> boguh: not officially.
[06:53] <aMicke> the wireless docs can't help me anymore
[06:53] <erikgz> crimsun: do you know how to regen the ubuntu menu.lst?
[06:53] <TC`> how to share internet to other computer while this pc is getting internet from proxy with dns..
[06:53] <boguh> crimsun which repository? or where to get?
[06:53] <crimsun> erikgz: grub-install
[06:53] <thinkgreen> asbo: you think it might be the modem? i just have it set up with my modem as the gateway and the ips assigned by hand
[06:53] <crimsun> boguh: install it manually
[06:53] <attilio> LjL, I'm in Xfce4
[06:54] <TritonX> TC': have you tried Firestarter ?
[06:54] <erikgz> crimsun: ahhh, perhaps that won't fail now that i have those stage1 and stage2 (grub CL works)
[06:54] <LjL> attilio: oh i see, well same thing, browse around in your xfce control panel and see if you have any proxy setting... and do try the console thing anyway
[06:54] <asbo> thinkgreen: can you use dhcp
[06:54] <asbo> ?
[06:54] <azureal> i've decided that the comprehensive sound guide in ubuntu forums is extremely dangerous
[06:54] <Johnny-K> does anyone have a few minutes to spare sorting out my modem problems?
[06:54] <tigerspirit> Hello, all.  I need direction to a source for help.  I am not a highly educated Ubuntu user, although I am learning.  I have BB (5.x) with all the updates, and am running FF as my browser.  i downloaded and installed FF2, however i seem to have a mishmash installation -- the borwser About shows it as 1.5.0.1.  When I try to install themese for 2.0, i get an error saying that they don't work...
[06:54] <tigerspirit> ...in 1.5.0,.1, but when I try to install earlier themese, the error says they don't work in 2.0.  Ideally, I'd like to run 1.5 and 2 completely spearately, as I am a designer, and want to see the work in as many non-MS browsers as possible.  Any suggestions, or places on the web i can get help?
[06:54] <crimsun> azureal: of course, as are many things that can be found on the forum
[06:54] <thinkgreen> asbo: i disabled the dhcp server on my modem becuase i need to keep the same local ip for port forwarding
[06:54] <Lemino> come on, isn't this channel supposed to support newbies like me?
[06:54] <asbo> thinkgreen: indeed :)
[06:54] <maxb_at_work> crimsun: I don't have any xserver-xorg-video-* packages installed... does that mean bits of my X installation are still using the dapper version, or just that I don't need any of those packages?
[06:55] <thinkgreen> asbo: also, the dhcp server was handing out weird DNS values (one local, one publi)
[06:55] <asbo> thinkgreen: netstat -a
[06:55] <azureal> crimsun, that guide is...
[06:55] <crimsun> maxb_at_work: Edgy doesn't need xserver-xorg-driver-*
[06:55] <erikgz> crimsun: say that i have a boot partition (/dev/hda1), and i want to install grub on the MBR of hda... how do i tell grub-install "root (hd0,0); setup (hd0)" ?
[06:55] <azureal> crimsun, it's a mix of sev. separate things
[06:55] <rc-1>  if i were to do a rinstall is there a way to save a list of packages i have and then make the rinstall redownload them?
[06:55] <azureal> crimsun, and combined it makes the guide dangerous
[06:55] <TritonX> anyone with a laptop with a go420... ?
[06:55] <thinkgreen> asbo: i get a lot of output...
=== FRET_ is now known as FRET
[06:56] <asbo> thinkgreen: netstat -a|more
[06:56] <crimsun> erikgz: or you can use the /dev name
[06:56] <cyzie> how do i select audio channel to left or right in mplayer/realplayer like in vlc does?
[06:56] <asbo> thinkgreen: i have the feeling its your modem
[06:56] <azureal> i need to keep restarting just to test it...
[06:56] <aMicke> Hi, i have some weird problems with my wirless card... The drivers, ipw3945 are installed and i can find networks but when i try to connect to my network i get "connection failed" even if the network is open, not encrypted, I have searched in the foums and on google but haven't been able to find an answear so please help me.
[06:56] <erikgz> so, grub-install /dev/hda1 ?  how does that tell it to do the MBR?
[06:56] <crimsun> drop the 1
[06:56] <TC`> no
[06:56] <thinkgreen> asbo: i've got a lot of connections, should i look for something in particular
[06:56] <erikgz> crimsun: but my boot partition is /dev/hda1, my root is /dev/hda5
[06:57] <TC`> !firestarter
[06:57] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[06:57] <crimsun> erikgz: the install device is not necessarily a partition.
[06:57] <tritium> rc-1: dpkg --get-selections will create that list for you
[06:57] <asbo> thinkgreen: forget netstat - my bad
[06:57] <asbo> thinkgreen: sudo apt-get install iftop
[06:57] <erikgz> crimsun: it's not obvious to me how grub-install figures out that the grub installation i want the MBR to point to is /dev/hda1
[06:57] <asbo> iftop is a network monitor
[06:58] <asbo> thinkgreen: may help with diags
[06:58] <crimsun> erikgz: then use a grub device (which I implied by the 'or')
[06:58] <rc-1> tritium: ah ok thanks so much :) and then i could probably make a script to sudo apt-get install them somehow, right?
[06:58] <thinkgreen> asbo: installing...

[07:04] <Yancho> yes there is LjL
[07:04] <thinkgreen> asbo: is their anything like a dhcp lease, or some reason my ip address would expire if i'm not running a dhcp server?
[07:04] <earthian> i belive there is no wine in ubuntu/universe repositories

[07:04] <asbo> thinkgreen: is there a patern to the disconnects?
[07:04] <cpl-tnt44> earthian : what server ?

[07:04] <snoops> cpl-tnt44 alright, well you can either edit a file to enabled the universe repository or you can use synaptic package manager to enable it in a gui..
[07:04] <variant> Yancho: you need to make your router assign a range of ip address that are fixed then

[07:05] <asbo> thinkgreen: strange
[07:05] <Yancho> can't i just fix it variant .. the router is hopeless :P

[07:05] <Yancho> yes variant .. for now its gonna be a 10.0.0.137 then it will be a foreign ip
[07:06] <cpl-tnt44> earthian : yeap thats why i asked ... or moved btw
[07:06] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: yes. universe. the bot gave you links on how to enabled it.
[07:06] <variant> Yancho: a foreign ip?
[07:06] <snoops> why's it called universe? Well, not quite sure, but I just thought it's a place where everything that doesn't already have a category goes.. it's just out there.. contains other bits and pieces
[07:06] <xst> Bug 58721 is a showstopper in edgy for most Matrox graphics card owners. However, its importance hasn't been set even though the bug was reported for ages ago. Can non-maintainers in any way push the importance of this critical bug?

[07:12] <alakazamz0r> not setting the resolution right

[07:17] <dnite> ah.. 13.. i was close.. hehehe
[07:17] <dnite> Edgy is freezing up on random. Mouse still moves, but nothing responds to it. Keyboard seems to do nothing. This usually happens while using Firefox, the last messages i see in the log after I hard reset the machine are 'Buffer I/O Error on device sde1, logical block 1708' 'lost page write due to I/O error on sde1' 'REISERFS: about (device sde1): Journal write error in flush_commit_list' ... any help???
[07:17] <LjL> nice answers, but he's gone
[07:17] <joona> :D
[07:18] <dnite> haha.. didn't even notice that, oh well
[07:18] <spunout> My apt-get is broken, xfonts-intl-european will neither uninstall or reinstall, the post-removal script returns error 2, and if i dpkg --purge it, it says its in a very bad state and to reinstall before purging
[07:18] <crimsun> 2.6.17.10 is incorrect
[07:18] <freach`> dnite: reiserfs ....
[07:18] <spunout> I can find the post-removal script, but what do i do wiht it?
[07:18] <LjL> crimsun: tell that to APT, not to me :-P
[07:18] <crimsun> that's only a package version. We point people to the changelog so they can see the entry for linux-source-2.6.17 (2.6.17-10.31)
[07:19] <crimsun> "* Merge 2.6.17.11 -> 2.6.17.13"
[07:19] <kalila> Orca is sweet, now how do you disable it :P
[07:19] <spunout> Can I just go in and delete all references to xfonts-intl-european, or will that break things more? (btw, i was upgrading to edgy when all this happened)
[07:21] <spunout> How do you get rid of a package that's in a very bad inconsistent state, that will neither uninstall or reinstall?
[07:21] <LjL> spunout, it's a tricky business
[07:21] <ulwur> Hi! Trying to install realplayer on Dapper: this happends realplay: Depends: libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.12.3) but 1.12.2-0ubuntu3 is to be installed
[07:21] <xSUSHi> spunout: dont use the gui tool
[07:22] <crimsun> ulwur: that's silly. Use 'realplay' from dapper-commercial.
[07:22] <spunout> I was using apt-get.  I remember messing with a post install script,w hen something like this happpend before, a long time ago
[07:22] <spunout> or maybeit was a post-removal script
[07:22] <spunout> (but not on this computer)
[07:22] <spunout> and that fixed it
[07:22] <mepaYancho> i installed LAMP .. but how can i test if it really works ?
[07:22] <spunout> but I cant remember how to fix this situation
[07:22] <LjL> ulwur, you need to enable multiverse in the edgy-updates and edgy-security repos, as well as in the edgy repo (crimsum, see also)

[07:23] <Ubuntu_User> What other GUIs can I get for Ubuntu besides KDE and Gnome? I'm looking for something low profile and clean. Can they be installed via apt-get if I were to do a server install of Ubuntu?
[07:23] <mepaYancho> xSUSHi can i test http too ?
[07:23] <LjL> spunout: yes, hunt for the postinst script in /var/dpkg or wherever it is, and hack it so that it returns 0. but that's a horrible idea.
[07:24] <ulwur> crimsun: All updates applied
[07:24] <xSUSHi> mepayancho: heres a good one: www.lamphowto.com

[07:30] <deema> is there a way to remove updates?
[07:30] <micahcowan> deema: To do that, see System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Desktop, and assign a sequence to "Run a terminal"
[07:30] <xSUSHi> rdemanow: i think you have to install WEP support
[07:30] <xSUSHi> cplp-tnt44 process manager
[07:30] <micahcowan> deema, do you mean, revert to a previous version of a package?
[07:30] <rdemanow> cpl-tnt44: xkill or ps from the command line and do a kill -9 on the pid
[07:30] <ianmacgregor> deema: You can also make a panel launcher for it. The command to use is gnome-terminal
[07:30] <deema> I suppose. I just did a security update and it's crashing

[07:33] <pfhomer> HELP: I have an old ThinkPad i1300 with 128 MB RAM, 10 GB HD, 700 MHz Celeron that i have installed Kubuntu on. I have two problems: Firstly, it wont hibernate. Secondly, it is dog slow, probably because of too little RAM and KDE that uses too much RAM. So: Which distro is more likely to hibernate my i1300? And which desktop/wm is best for computers with little memory? What distro should i use?
[07:33] <quintin> pfhomer: might try xubuntu.  hibernate should work on all computers as long as your swap is bigger than your ram
[07:33] <micahcowan> deema, was gnome-panel one of the security updates?
[07:33] <deema> don't remember!
[07:33] <spunout> pfhomer, you probly need to set up apm instead of acpi.  try xubuntu, and to suspend, with apm installed, type apm -s
[07:34] <spunout> or is it apm -S?
[07:34] <ianmacgregor> pfhomer: For a desktop, you might look into xubuntu, for other window managers I would recommend fluxbox, openbox or Window Maker.
[07:34] <deema> how can I access the update manager through the terminal?
[07:34] <deema> to see
[07:34] <cpl-tnt44> well ?

[07:38] <crimsun> a security update.
[07:38] <micahcowan> mepaYancho, you can either use the h,j,k,l keys, or install regular vim (you have vim-tiny installed).

[07:39] <micahcowan> mepaYancho, yes. You may also need to run update-alternatives to set the vim alternative to /usr/bin/vim instead of /usr/bin/vim-tiny.
[07:40] <mepaYancho> micahcowan from where? 0:) - ur talking with an idiot here hehe
[07:40] <crimsun> deema: image library.  SECURITY UPDATE: Remote arbitrary code execution.

[08:00] <concept10> Is BUM (boot up manager) compatible with the new upstart scripts?
[08:00] <GyrosGeier> hmm
[08:00] <bobbyyu> How do I use the shared files utility in Edgy. WHen I pick either option (NFS or Samba), it doesn't accept it
[08:00] <GyrosGeier> the issue at hand is that the box is Xubuntu only
[08:00] <bobbyyu> How esle can I configure my shares?
[08:00] <GyrosGeier> and the user is not very proficient, to say the least
[08:01] <LjL> GyrosGeier, if the modem is a winmodem, it won't be easy to set up.
[08:01] <concept10> bobbyyu, depends on what you want to share
[08:01] <GyrosGeier> the connection works
[08:01] <LjL> GyrosGeier: if it's a hardware modem, it should be

[08:01] <GyrosGeier> but it always dials up on boot
[08:01] <Karark_> I need some help with what seems to be cookies... every time I log in to the forum it logs me out when going to a new page.
[08:01] <bobbyyu> Say I want to share my mounted drives
[08:01] <bobbyyu> and my home directory
[08:01] <micahcowan> deema, I'm wondering if it was actually today's update: when's the last time you had restarted your computer, besides today?
[08:01] <GyrosGeier> I need to install something that will present an icon to toggle online/offline, preferably so that I don't pull in half of GNOME
[08:02] <hmrocha> hello
[08:02] <teledyn> bobbyyu: what is the shared files utility?  just set up an nfs server
[08:02] <GyrosGeier> because the box only has 40MiB HD space left. :-/
[08:02] <deema> a few days ago I guess
[08:02] <nlindblad> iter: now it won't even recognize PHP as a filetype, just asks me what to open a "PHTML" with :S
[08:02] <hmrocha> i have just bought a sony vaio c series, and booted with edgy
[08:02] <bobbyyu> The one that comes with Ubuntu
[08:02] <concept10> bobbyyu, im not sure about the new GUIs, but I use a combination of the GUI and the command line.  In sambas case, you want want to go to the terminal and reload samba so it may pick up the shares
[08:02] <`fog> hello
[08:02] <iter> nlindblad: no problem that's apache conf
[08:02] <hmrocha> graphics card works pretty well out of the box
[08:03] <nlindblad> iter: why did it change?
[08:03] <teledyn> bobbyyu: install nfs-kernel-server and off you go.  man exports
[08:03] <hmrocha> but wireless and ethernet are not recognized
[08:03] <`fog> i downloaded ubuntu but it didnt install the modemdriver
[08:03] <TC`> !iptables
[08:03] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[08:03] <bobbyyu> I'm sharing my files with a Windows computer
[08:03] <hmrocha> do you have any hints on how i can correct this?
=== CreativeEmbassy is now known as ClassEmbassy
[08:03] <abbyz> hi
[08:03] <teledyn> bobbyyu: in that case samba.   i think there's an smb.conf manpage
[08:04] <`fog> wireless and ethernet were recognized but the modem wasnt?
[08:04] <teledyn> bobbyyu: irregardless, the file is so well commented you don't really need a man page
[08:04] <bobbyyu> Do I just type man smb.conf ?
[08:04] <Karark_> I need some help with what seems to be cookies... every time I log in to the forum it logs me out when going to a new page... deleting the cookies and saved password doesn't remedy the problem
[08:04] <ton> i have squid installed on my pc , but my windows clients are losing theirs connection each 2 minutes using msn messenger, could someone help me ?
[08:04] <bobbyyu> Is smb.conf in my Home directory?
[08:04] <teledyn> bobbyyu: just edit the file and read a lot of the comments/info in it.  it has some good examples that you can tweak to your liking
[08:04] <LjL> GyrosGeier, i'm really ust guessing, because i can't find a relevant document. perhaps you could check /etc/network/interfaces and set the "noauto" option for ppp0, since i guess the problem is caused by the connection being set to automatically start as soon as a program requests a non-local URL
[08:04] <bobbyyu> Where can I find smb.conf?
[08:05] <LjL> bobbyyu: /etc
[08:05] <concept10> bobbyyu, in that case you want to use samba.  to restart sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
[08:05] <jrwa> hi there
[08:05] <GyrosGeier> LjL, yep, that is the easy part
[08:05] <teledyn> bobbyyu: do you know how to list contents of packages?
[08:05] <teledyn> bobbyyu: dpkg -L samba |less
[08:05] <jrwa> I've got a friend installing ubuntu, and on the mounting points step... only /media/sda1...4 are showing
[08:05] <GyrosGeier> LjL, I've let that on because the user would not know how to start the connection besides turning the modem off and on

If you recently added an applet or somesuch to the panel, you might try disabling that... please do submit a bug on gnome-panel, and include both the backtrace and the relevant portions from .xsession-errors. There are other crash bug reports on gnome-panel, but it's not

[08:19] <micahcowan> teclo, the problem may be that console-setup only sets up keyboard (and not fonts, which may include some of the necessary UTF-8 stuff for you) if it's still in upstart.
[08:19] <micahcowan> So, it behaves differently than it does when the system's already up.

[08:21] <micahcowan> teclo, I've found that idiocy is most often best left ignored. Pointing it out to them is "casting pearls before swine". :/
[08:21] <Mojo> what was the fascist argument?
[08:22] <teclo> micahcowan: So in this channel, you don't tolerate when someone uses the f-word, but you tolerate such fascist arguments ? That's "interesting".

[08:23] <Dr_Sato> But than I have t install he X after right
[08:23] <chill> Dr_Sato: i believe you can afterwards install 'ubuntu-desktop'
[08:23] <Dr_Sato> hmm... alternate install disc
[08:23] <dang`r`us> any tips on what I could do against the apparently broken packages in edgy? ( http://rafb.net/paste/results/sn46ki64.html - I need to install libsdl-dev)

[08:23] <spunout> Dr_Sato, you may also try xubuntu, if overhead is an issue.   it is low footprint

[08:25] <spunout> Dr_Sato, just remember, no start menu.  right click on desktop for menu...
[08:25] <chill> Dr_Sato: it is cleaner and faster, but its without all the fancy config stuff from gnome
[08:26] <micahcowan> teclo: when you say gdm wouldn't come up right when it was at S30, what exactly does that mean? Did it not come up at all? It doesn't seem like console-setup should mess with anything GDM relies on...
[08:26] <chill> spunout: it has a startmenu!
[08:26] <teclo> micahcowan: I'm gonna try again with S30console-setup
[08:26] <spunout> chill, yes, but you click on the desktop for it, right?  or am i thinking of fluxbox or something else?

[08:29] <Alzi2> Hey. How do I enable the TTY's from 8 to 12?
[08:31] <micahcowan> teclo, I'm not running edgy on this machine, so I probably won't be able to help you much further: what I can tell you, though, is that you need to be sure that the console-setup init script runs while usplash is /not/ running, otherwise it won't do the full configure. You'll need to find someone running Edgy to help you further, probably.
[08:32] <UKMatt> What's a good program to trasncode videos?
[08:32] <cyzie> im looking for a software that obtain data either from database or text file and plot the graph automatically? is there such like softwares?
[08:32] <micahcowan> Alzi2, if you want to do that permanently, you'll probably want to add further lines to /etc/inittab. Look at the lines with /sbin/getty in them, and add a few more there. I'd leave 7 and 8 open, personally. gdm/X needs 7, and 8 sometimes has another X (switched user) or usplash (if run after gdm).

[08:36] <Drac|School> shredder_: ifconfig for local ip. whatismyip.com for public IP. :P
[08:37] <MitchM> whtasmyip.net*
[08:37] <tijn_> mmh anyone arround with a little wifi knowledge?
[08:37] <Drac|School> MitchM: Yeah. That.
[08:37] <MitchM> tijn_ yes?
[08:37] <Drac|School> shredder_: See MitchM
[08:37] <Alzi2> anyone?
[08:37] <Alzi2> Hey. How do I enable the TTY's from 8 to 12? I mena, in Upstart... What is the inittab?
[08:37] <tijn_> MitchM: its not os related btw
[08:37] <MitchM> tijn_ yes?
[08:37] <Drac|School> How can I install the nVidia beta drivers through apt? (please don't link me - I'm in a console)
[08:37] <dom_f> Has anyone some time to help me troubleshoot a problem I'm having with Edgy?  My root file system doesn't show up in df or mount (but is mounted!)
[08:37] <godmaster> fernch here?
[08:37] <MitchM> tijn_: What is the question?
[08:37] <tijn_> i have 1 wireless modem, and 1 wireless switch with 4 lan ports
[08:37] <godmaster> french here?
[08:38] <bimberi> !fr
[08:38] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:38] <bluefox83> Drac|School, beta drivers?
[08:38] <shredder_> im downloading nvidia driver via automatix right now
[08:38] <teclo> godmaster: essaye plutt /join #ubuntu-fr
[08:38] <tijn_> i want the switch to be a repeater
[08:38] <tijn_> so that it connect with wifi to the modem, and i can plug in a cable in a lan port
[08:38] <tijn_> is this even possible?
[08:39] <CarinArr> i'm not sure why, but all of a sudden when i try ot play mp3s (or any sound) mplayer tells me open /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p failed: Device or resource busy
[08:39] <CarinArr> i was listening to music yesterday afternoon and i can't think that i've changed anything since
[08:40] <hckrSid> I'm having a strange problem with edgy that I didn't have with dapper... As soon as I connect an external display (CRT or projector) to my laptop, I get logged out.
[08:40] <legonio> Does anyone know how to mount a encrypted partition with truecrypt on edgy eft?
[08:40] <shredder_> I'm not too sure but everytime i install ubuntu the first thing i install is VLC... never failed on me
[08:40] <godmaster> something know about pgp?
[08:40] <godmaster> i have a problem
[08:41] <CarinArr> can anyone tell me how i can figure out what is using my sound card?
[08:41] <Alzi2> Hey. How do I enable the TTY's from 8 to 12? I mean, in Upstart... What is the inittab? Anyone?
[08:41] <Alzi2> Where*
[08:41] <tijn_> MitchM: ?
[08:41] <deema> what's a way to close a full screen game?
[08:41] <MitchM> tijn_: apologies; phone call.
[08:42] <tijn_> np
[08:42] <Alzi2> deema: Ctrl+Alt+F1, ps aux, killall -9 programname
[08:42] <shredder_> CarinArr -- sometimes when i close a media player the music doesnt stop... it plays on the background... i log out and log on again and it works fine have you tried that
[08:42] <deema> is there an easier way?
[08:42] <VR^> is it better to usually use the repos "from your country"? would that be faster? i've been experiencing some lag lately with the default repos.
[08:42] <MitchM> tijn_: It is possible depending on what router you have.
[08:42] <Alzi2> deema: Ctrl+Alt+Backspace.
[08:42] <MitchM> tijn_: What type of wireless router are you using?
[08:42] <tijn_> well, one is a sweex
[08:42] <Alzi2> Hey. How do I enable the TTY's from 8 to 12? I mean, in Upstart... What is the inittab? Please? Anyone? Please don't ignore me....
[08:42] <deema> what's ps aux mean?
[08:43] <Alzi2> deema: It's a command you input in the terminal
[08:43] <tijn_> in the sweex switch, i can use it as 'station ad-hoc'
[08:43] <hckrSid> I'm having a strange problem with edgy that I didn't have with dapper... As soon as I connect an external display (CRT or projector) to my laptop, I get logged out.
[08:43] <deema> yes, what does that mean
[08:43] <MitchM> tijn_: hmm.
[08:43] <CarinArr> shredder_, i tried completely rebooting but it's still the same
[08:43] <MitchM> tijn_: It really all depends on what type of router you have; some routers can connect "as clients" to other routers.
[08:43] <Alzi2> deema: ps aux displays a list of all running applications on your system. Using that you can figure out the name of the running game and eliminate it with killall -9 <programname>
[08:43] <w30> Alzi2, edit /etc/inittab and add more ttys than the listed 1 thru 6
[08:43] <deema> oh okay
[08:44] <MitchM> tijn_: Like a cracked Version of a linksys router can do that.
[08:44] <Alzi2> w30: It doesn't exist on Edgy.
[08:44] <deema> thanks
[08:44] <tijn_> more options btw, wait, gonna hoop up my laptop to some external power :)
[08:44] <deema> what about the -9?
[08:44] <dom_f> tijn_: Belkin routers can do this
[08:44] <MitchM> tijn_: I know its possible; but unsure of how to do it with your specific connection.
[08:44] <iwkse> hi all. Somebody uses moto4lin here??
[08:44] <w30> Alzi2, sorry I only am familier with Dapper
[08:44] <Alzi2> Hey. How do I enable the TTY's from 8 to 12? I mean, in Upstart (Edgy Eft)... Where is the inittab?
[08:44] <Alzi2> w30: Ok, thanks.
[08:44] <dom_f> Can anyone suggest how I troubleshoot the root partition not showing in df or mount in Edgy?
[08:45] <tijn_> MitchM: ok, i will list the possible settings for sharing
[08:45] <tijn_> om
[08:45] <tijn_> mom*
[08:45] <Belping> can anyone tell me if there is a bash command to see the network upload and download speed?
[08:45] <shredder_> CarinArr maybe you can find some clue at System > Administration > System Monitor
[08:45] <karl> hi everyone, new to ubuntu
[08:45] <karl> and apache
[08:45] <VR^> is it better to usually use the repos "from your country"? would that be faster? i've been experiencing some lag lately with the default repos.
[08:46] <tijn_> MitchM: so its client dependant?
[08:46] <shredder_> VR^ smetimes other country repos are faster
[08:46] <MitchM> tijn_: its router dependant
[08:47] <shredder_> right now I'm downloadin at 34.7kB/s which is very very slow
[08:47] <tijn_> MitchM: yea ok, but the wireless modem doesnt matter right, its about the device i want to act as repeater
[08:47] <karl> need some help. have installed apache2 and changed the port so my friends can reach the root of the ip. how do i ad stuff to the root? tried to just copy into /var/www but it says i dont have the permission, and when i typ to change the permissions it says im not the owner so i cant.. what sould i do?
[08:47] <tijn_> if iam correct, and i hope so ;)
[08:47] <MitchM> tijn_: oh - soy ou want your laptop to "relay" the wireless connection?
[08:47] <godmaster> someone know about pgp i have a problem
[08:47] <godmaster> ?
[08:48] <Avaloniac> hi
[08:48] <godmaster> i have a problem when i want to publish my public key
[08:48] <tijn_> MitchM: nope, i mean 'client' like in router which has to connect to the modem over wifi
[08:48] <iwkse> which device uses ubuntu to mount usb stuff?
[08:48] <shredder_> karl you need su access to write to apache http docs
[08:48] <MitchM> tijn_: yeah. It depends on the "router" acting as a "wireless client"
[08:48] <tijn_> ah ok
[08:48] <karl> shredder: how do i get that?
[08:49] <MitchM> tijn_: Linksys with cracked firmware can do it easy.
[08:49] <MitchM> tijn_: Cisco makes WGB (Work Group Bridges) just for that purpose
[08:49] <VR^> shredder_: how can i check which repos are currently quicker than mine? where do i chose the country?
[08:50] <tijn_> in that case, i can let it act as: AP, Station-AD Hoc, Station-Infrastructure, AP Bridge-Point to Point, AP Bridge-Point to Mulipoint, or AP Bridge-WDS
[08:50] <wsgrimes> does anyone know how to format the output of  "ls -R /Some/Folder" to display fullpath filenames?
[08:50] <tijn_> i think the correct option is one of these modes, but i dont know which one
[08:50] <Belping> can anyone tell me if there is a bash command to see the network upload and download speed?
[08:50] <tijn_> Belping: you can use iptraf
[08:50] <hume> hej igen....
[08:51] <iter> Belping: no, but you can use ntop or bmon to check from console
[08:51] <Belping> ok thanks guys!
[08:52] <MitchM> tijn_: Station-Adhoc would probably be your best bet.
[08:52] <tijn_> YES! MitchM thnx it works :)
[08:53] <tijn_> already had that, but i forgot that i have an acl based on mac
[08:53] <tijn_> :)
[08:53] <MitchM> har har =)
[08:54] <Sensae> I configured fglrx, and now when I restart the X server it's at too high a refresh rate, and after 5 seconds my monitor goes into standby mode. I've played with xorg.conf but can't get the defaults to change.
[08:54] <axa-axa> Can someone please send me /bin/bash file ?
[08:54] <karl> does anyone know i get the su access shredder talket about?
[08:54] <natalka> hej
[08:55] <kikokos_> hejk
[08:55] <shredder_> karl in terminal type sudo nautilus
[08:55] <karl> ok
[08:55] <shredder_> that will give you file manager with root access
[08:55] <shredder_> then you can copy whatever you want
[08:55] <tijn_> MitchM: hmm lan ports arent asosiated i think :(
[08:55] <josator> hi
[08:55] <karl> shredder_: ok
[08:56] <josator> how can i block a package to avoid upgrading it?
[08:56] <Sensae> Anyone know how to change the default xorg refresh rate?
[08:56] <GyrosGeier> josator, by using "hold" or "forbid"
[08:56] <josator> is a command?
[08:57] <GyrosGeier> josator, depending on what you want to achieve, and how your package manager does that
[08:57] <josator> apt
[08:57] <gentoo> Hi, does ubuntu use lilo ?
[08:57] <GyrosGeier> josator, aptitude can do both
[08:57] <josator> i want to keep my version of dmraid
[08:57] <kikokos_> hi
[08:57] <spazzPP2> hi
[08:57] <apokryphos> gentoo: grub by default, but lilo can be used.
[08:57] <GyrosGeier> josator, then "aptitude hold dmraid"
[08:57] <spazzPP2> what's thebest partition format?
[08:57] <josator> thanks
[08:57] <kikokos_> could you help me I made new user because ol-user had a bad configuration file
[08:57] <apokryphos> spazzPP2: no "best", good for different needs. ext3 is defualt on Ubuntu
[08:58] <josator> it will hold it even if i upgrade to edgy??
[08:58] <kikokos_> now i cannot log in gnome as new user because I have`nt acces to ICE.authority file
[08:58] <spazzPP2> I want to store files on it..
[08:58] <gentoo> apokryphos: can you upload the "standard" menu.lst too a pastebin ? as im not using ubuntu, but i like the menu
[08:58] <GyrosGeier> josator, if you just wanted to skip a known broken version, "forbid" could be used to tell it to ignore that particular version, but upgrade on the next
[08:58] <GyrosGeier> josator, yes
[08:58] <kikokos_> has anybody something like this?
[08:58] <josator> ok
[08:58] <josator> thx GyrosGeier
[08:58] <GyrosGeier> ext3 is the best filesystem.
[08:58] <spazzPP2> k thx
[08:59] <josator> you are a good person
[08:59] <josator> ^^
[08:59] <apokryphos> gentoo: I don't use the Ubuntu grub menu, but you can get it, and all such files, from packages.ubuntu.com
[08:59] <GyrosGeier> reiser* is not tested well enough, xfs is known to eat data and be slow
[08:59] <teclo> The damn thing won't work ! For my console to be clean, I need to sudo /etc/init.d/console-setup start after logging in
[08:59] <kikokos_> have you seen ICE.authority access denied?
[08:59] <kikokos_> :)
[08:59] <apokryphos> GyrosGeier: what? reiserfs is *very* very widely used
[09:00] <apokryphos> Perhaps you mean reiser4
[09:00] <LjL> don't start a filesystem war. ext3 is just the default Ubuntu filesystem, so if you're unsure, use it.
[09:00] <kikokos_> how i see no :P
[09:00] <godmaster> i have a problem with gnu pgp someone can help me ?
[09:00] <Avaloniac> how to change soundcard order, making the second default ?
[09:00] <shredder_> wars suck... use the default and be happy
[09:00] <apokryphos> !anyone
[09:00] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[09:01] <dom_f> Can anyone suggest how I troubleshoot the root partition not showing in df or mount in Edgy?  I've spent a long while googling and searching ubuntuforums and could do with some help!  More info at https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/2258
[09:01] <dom_f> Thx
[09:01] <Paddy_EIRE> can anyone help me with my graphics driver
[09:02] <Paddy_EIRE> im using an ati radeon 9250
[09:02] <shredder_> if its ATI good luck
[09:02] <GyrosGeier> dom_f, your /etc/mtab is out of sync with the real world
[09:02] <Paddy_EIRE> lol
[09:02] <Paddy_EIRE> i know
[09:02] <bcnl> any suggestions on how to get WPA2 to work with the default network gui?
[09:02] <bcnl> or should it "just work"
[09:02] <tat> "just works" here :)
[09:02] <asdx> why ubuntu don't shipt 6.10 cds?
[09:02] <bcnl> :>
[09:02] <dom_f> GyrosGeier: I know - however this is constant after each reboot and some things seem to depend on mtab
[09:03] <Paddy_EIRE> asdx: because its not LTS
[09:03] <asdx> Paddy_EIRE: so, when the next LTS comes ubuntu will shipt that?
[09:03] <Paddy_EIRE> asdx: maybe
[09:03] <shiv> LjL: u there?
[09:04] <shiv> LjL: I am trying to boot it with grub
[09:04] <Paddy_EIRE> asdx: for now dapper is a staple with 3 years support on the desktop and 5 on the server
[09:04] <GyrosGeier> dom_f, I don't know the details of that process, given that the root fs is usually mounted with -n I'm actually puzzled it *does* show up
=== jtwronski is now known as humbraro

[09:05] <Sensae> Anyone? Changing the refresh rate on Xorg using fglrx?
[09:05] <St_MPA3b> how can i move trash shourtcut on desktop? (gnome)
[09:05] <St_MPA3b> how can i move trash shourtcut on desktop? (gnome)
[09:05] <djmccormick> i installed the bittorrent package with apt-get but i don't seem to have bittorrent-curses. i'm running 6.06 on a command-line only machine. anyone know why it isn't included? will i have to install from source?
[09:05] <asdx> Paddy_EIRE: but dapper drake in 3 years will be pretty old, don't you think?
[09:05] <St_MPA3b> how can i move trash shourtcut _to_ desktop? (gnome)
[09:05] <asdx> Paddy_EIRE: unless you upgrade
[09:05] <[Wiebel] > St_MPA3b: stop it
[09:05] <Karark_> Sensae, what do you mean?
[09:05] <nomis_> St_MPA3b, in gconf-editor you can select it
[09:05] <dom_f> OK - back to basics - does / show up in df on Edgy for anyone else?
[09:05] <Paddy_EIRE> asdx: yeah well, look at windows xp thats been out for quite a while
[09:06] <St_MPA3b> <nomis_> thanks
[09:06] <Paddy_EIRE> asdx: i think with the continued updates and a stable version of xgl/compiz dapper will always be fresh
[09:06] <dom_f> GyrosGeier:  Didn't know it was mounted with -n
[09:06] <Sensae> Karark_: I apt the fglrx package and got it configured properly, it's working perfectly, but when the X servers starts up I see the ubuntu login screen, my monitor complains about the refresh rate and it goes into standby mode
[09:06] <LjL> shiv: and what happens when you try? and, have you moved that NTFS partition around since last time it booted?
[09:07] <Sensae> Karark_: If I log in I can still hear all the sounds and the X server is working, my monitor just can't handle the display settings
[09:07] <Paddy_EIRE> does anyone fancy helping sort out my ati driver
[09:07] <dom_f> Paddy - which version of Ubuntu are you using?
[09:07] <Paddy_EIRE> its a real bit*h
[09:07] <shiv> LjL: no I have not moved anything. It used to give me 0x7 error. Now I am just getting - prompt
[09:07] <Vornotron> THis morning a package (libpam-ldap) got upgraded on a server of mine, and broke the service.  I'm looking for a changelog that describes the changes it made and am having no luck.

[09:08] <Jony> hi

[09:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wordperfect - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:08] <LjL> shiv, i'm not sure, perhaps pastebin your /grub/boot/menu.lst
[09:08] <LjL> !fishing
[09:08] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[09:08] <humbraro> hey all.  I'm having an issue with wine:
[09:08] <shiv> LjL: ok wait
[09:08] <Sensae> Karark_: I've tried that
[09:09] <Karark_> Sensae, and what has happened?
[09:09] <Jony> My Logitech MX5000 don't work in ubuntu Edgy
[09:09] <rc-1> i know GNU means GNU not unix but why G?  chosen totally randomly?
[09:09] <GyrosGeier> dom_f, it is, because / is readonly at this point, which leads to mount failing because it writes the new mtab to a temp file first, then mounts, then renames
[09:09] <Sensae> Karark_: I set it to use fglrx and it kept using the OSS drivers
[09:09] <Jony> how can i fix it
[09:09] <humbraro> I'm trying to install wordperfect office, which depends on IE to install.  I installed ies4linux, but the wordperfect installer doesn't see it
[09:09] <POVaddct> rc-1: it's a recursive acronym
[09:09] <djmccormick> GyrosGeier: it surely  meant something long ago, maybe the meaning has been lost.
[09:09] <prestosd> Help@@
[09:09] <prestosd> !!!
[09:09] <prestosd> I can't upgrade to 6.10
[09:10] <St_MPA3b> <nomis_>can u say name of the folder with that conf file?
[09:10] <djmccormick> (i meant to send that to rc-1)
[09:10] <Karark_> Sensae, OSS is a sound driver not video
[09:10] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell prestosd about upgrade
[09:10] <dom_f> GyrosGeier: Thanks.  Any idea what else I can check/try?
[09:10] <prestosd> um
[09:10] <Sensae> Karark_: Wrong term then, I mean the MESA drivers
[09:10] <nomis_> St_MPA3b, im searching right now. i think it was there
[09:10] <prestosd> when I run the update manager
[09:10] <GyrosGeier> dom_f, not really
[09:10] <humbraro> and, google isn't helping at all, for once
[09:10] <prestosd> it goes fine until the the main stuff
[09:10] <prestosd> then it says
[09:10] <shiv> LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29783/
[09:10] <prestosd> just a sec....
[09:10] <donfilipo> LjL remember me? troubles with watching media streams from internet....well i reinstaled the Edgy and done by the book and the shit happened again....since gxine was not doing it's job i installed kaffeine and for 20s the thing worked then gxine reapeared again...i deinstaled it but can not convince kafeine mozila plugin to start....the official site is out fo date...any idea how can i get help or should i just wait someone repairs this?
[09:10] <GyrosGeier> dom_f, you can always remount it again later
[09:10] <GyrosGeier> dom_f, then it should show up
[09:10] <Karark_> Sensae, have you rebooted since you did the dpkg... ?
[09:10] <dom_f> Thanks Anyway - anyone else got any ideas ? (df and mount missing root!)
[09:11] <voice> anyone here know why Ubuntu would not use the swap partition even though the ram is very low?

[09:12] <rbil> I noticed that the fonts used in xmms's dialog is almost unreadable here. Anyway to fix that?

[09:13] <Karark_> Sensae, you can do a 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' and see which driver shows up in that file... if it's not the fglrx then you didn't do the dpkg correctly

[09:14] <TC`> flash doesn't make sounds :x
[09:14] <rednelb> cartucho: I mean, I boot xp, and I want to run unbuntu within xp
[09:14] <Karark_> rbil, go to the preferences and choose a different font?
[09:14] <rednelb> sort of embedded
[09:14] <Jony> so help me !!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:14] <rbil> actually I don't usually use that p.o.s. but need to for soemthing
[09:14] <cartucho> rednelb: go for vmware
[09:14] <LjL> humbraro, looking at the Wine application database, i'm not sure i'd classify WordPerfect office as a supported application
[09:14] <cartucho> Jony: no, you're to unpolite.
[09:14] <POVaddct> !patience
[09:14] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[09:14] <rednelb> cartucho:  I need network support, tho
[09:14] <rednelb> cartucho: http://opensource.sfsu.edu/node/140
[09:15] <cartucho> rednelb: it has bridging dupport, it will be transparent
[09:15] <rbil> Karark_: nope that just controls the font used in xmms, not xmms's dialog box for changing options, etc.
[09:15] <Sensae> Karark_: My net crashed, did you get my last message?
[09:15] <LjL> rednelb: vmware has network support
[09:15] <Karark_> Sensae, no i don't believe so
[09:15] <rednelb> cartucho oh? good!
[09:15] <Jony> dam nis godt help her
[09:15] <Karark_> Sensae, you can do a 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' and see which driver shows up in that file... if it's not the fglrx then you didn't do the dpkg correctly
[09:15] <cartucho> rednelb: the main problem is that it is comercial
[09:15] <Sensae> Karark_: I said "I restarted the X server, I was under the impression the whole machine didn't need to be restarted"
[09:15] <dom_f> OK - GyrosGeier - if I try sudo mount  -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /   I get mount: /dev/hda1 already mounted or / busy
[09:15] <cartucho> rednelb: but you can work around this at astalavista.box.sk
[09:15] <donfilipo> LjL ok someone should warn people and since you are here the most time remember my expirience ...go by the book and install all the gstreamer 0.10 files than not gxine but kaffeine and the thing should probably work...if you mess you must reinstall again....i will not i will wait someone fix ther damn thing cause it worked fine on 6.06
[09:15] <GyrosGeier> dom_f, -o remount
[09:15] <Vornotron> ...apparently not only did it update, ubuntu.com doesn't know about it yet. :(
[09:16] <voice06> well, there went ubuntu again
[09:16] <LjL> Jony, you didn't even tell us what the problem is. how do you expect us to fix it?
[09:16] <Karark_> Sensae, ok, i got that one and you are right that you don't need to do a reboot
[09:16] <rbil> someone suggested in #xmms to fix gtk1 conf, but can't find that file and now he's not answering
[09:16] <cartucho> rbil: xmms is a crap
[09:16] <rbil> I know
[09:16] <cartucho> rbil: go for rhythmbox
[09:16] <rbil> I know
[09:16] <voice06> can someone help me with a issue involving Ubuntu and the system crashing?
[09:16] <rednelb> cartucho:  well, I've loaded vmware for non-commercial purposes... but then I need the right version of ubuntu that plays nice with vmware
[09:16] <rbil> christ, I know, but I need to use this
[09:16] <cartucho> voice06: go on
[09:16] <voice06> apparently its not using the swap partition
[09:16] <Sensae> Karark_: Yeah.. It's driving me crazy.
[09:16] <cartucho> voice06: try swapon on it
[09:16] <voice06> and the ram keeps getting maxed out, then ubuntu freezes
[09:17] <cartucho> voice06: try top, and see the swap
[09:17] <dom_f> That runs OK but still doesn't show up
[09:17] <Karark_> Sensae, did you check your xorg.conf file?
[09:17] <voice06> I've tried that, and I've viewed top
[09:17] <TC`> when i'm wathincg youtube clips, there's no sound, what to do?
[09:17] <LjL> donfilipo, the wiki guide is definitely broken for Edgy, but i can't edit it unless i know what's the correct way to do it on Edgy, and i don't. i've mentioned the issue in the documentation channel, that's about all i can do
[09:17] <rbil> troubleshooting something else for a friend who uses it, but on my system the damn dialog box font is almost unreadable
[09:17] <Sensae> Karark_: Check it for? Lemme open VNC.
[09:17] <cartucho> rbil: im gonna guess, try fc-cache
[09:17] <Karark_> Sensae, to see if you did the dpkg correctly... look for your driver
[09:17] <cartucho> voice06: cat /proc/meminfo
[09:17] <voice06> I had to switch over to my xp parition because Ubuntu keeps freezing
[09:18] <humbraro> LjL, I noticed that at winehq
[09:18] <mathias> can somebody help my with my second hard disk?
[09:18] <cartucho> mathias: go on
[09:18] <voice06> give me a moment, I'll boot it back into ubuntu
[09:18] <Zaggynl> Anyone knows how to get ventrilo working with wine?a
[09:18] <humbraro> LjL, however, the install fails on checking for internet explorer, which is installed
[09:18] <donfilipo> LjL do that i love to test even if it took me 2 days but now it's time for experts to look at it....thanks anyway
[09:18] <mathias> it doesn't show it me
[09:18] <Sensae> Karark_: Section "Device" Driver "fglrx"
[09:18] <cartucho> mathias: is it a ide or sata drive ?
[09:19] <axa-axa> Can someone plese tell me how can I, in relatively easy way, downgrade firefox in EdgyEft from 2.0.x to 1.5.0.7? Many plugins wont work and still dont support version 2.0.x.
[09:19] <cartucho> mathias: is it a new hd, i.E blank one
[09:19] <mathias> c
[09:19] <Sensae> Karark_: fglrxinfo for display 0 outputs MESA
[09:19] <humbraro> LjL, and, at this point, that seems to be the problem, not wordperfect
[09:19] <josator> edgy sucks
[09:19] <Karark_> Sensae, well damn, i don't know then... try asking again and see if someone with more knowledge responds
[09:19] <josator> can not install

[09:19] <Karark_> Sensae, good luck
[09:19] <mathias> it worked at my old computer verywell
[09:19] <Sensae> josator: Kubuntu or Ubuntu? I couldn't get Kubuntu Edgy to install
[09:19] <cartucho> mathias: ok try this first, dmesg | grep hd*
[09:19] <josator> ubuntu
[09:19] <luz> hi. how to start avast with gui?
[09:19] <Sensae> Karark_: :/ Thanks for the help
[09:19] <josator> dm-strip
[09:19] <Sensae> Both of the installers kept locking up
[09:20] <H3b0R> how do i get mx5000 to work with edgy eft?
[09:20] <cartucho> whats mx5000 anyway ?
[09:20] <LjL> humbraro: i don't know. you should try to find out what the wordperfect installer is actually checking for -- isn't there anything in the console (start the installer from a console) that could give a hint?
[09:20] <josator> "Target length not divisible by chunck size"
[09:20] <josator> "dm-strip: Target length not divisible by chunck size"
[09:20] <Sensae> Even moving a window would lock up (K)ubuntu installs, I had to not touch it after clicking install, lol
[09:20] <dom_f> Can someone running edgy run mount and confirm that root show up please?
[09:20] <josator> no problems in dapper
[09:20] <mathias> ??
[09:20] <axa-axa> shredder: yes, but many packets depend on it, and still the main problem is where can I find package for i386 EdgyEft?
[09:20] <hckrSid> Anyone know how to set up acpi to ignore an event?
[09:20] <H3b0R> cartucho, wireless keyboard and mouse
[09:21] <gentoo> can someone send me the content of their /etc/grub.conf if they use the original config from the installer
=== voice is now known as voice06
[09:21] <humbraro> LjL, it doesnt' show anything since its failing "gracefully".  also, there are no switches to the setup.exe to tell it not to check for ie
[09:21] <POVaddct> H3b0R: connected via usb?
[09:21] <shredder_> axa-axa, you should search for different versions on firefox website
[09:21] <josator> update-grup
[09:21] <voice06> back
[09:21] <Sensae> gentoo: 6.10 or 6.06?
[09:21] <H3b0R> POVaddict: ye its bluetooth devices
[09:22] <dom_f> Can someone running edgy run mount and confirm that root shows up in the list please?
[09:22] <voice06> so what am I looking for in the /proc/meminfo?
[09:22] <axa-axa> shredder: I already did but simply cannot find anything except the last one (2.x)
[09:22] <POVaddct> H3b0R: so not usb?
[09:22] <Sensae> dom_f: It doesn't for me.
[09:22] <dom_f> Sensae - doe sit show up in df?
[09:22] <cartucho> voice06: make a cat in it
[09:22] <LjL> humbraro, try typing    export WINEDEBUG="warn+all"  -   then the Wine output should become a lot more verbose
[09:22] <voice06> I have
[09:22] <cartucho> voice06: see if swap is being used
[09:22] <H3b0R> POVaddict: yes, it worked with dapper, but edgy not...
[09:22] <Sensae> dom_f: No.
[09:22] <dom_f> Thanks Sensae
[09:22] <josator> will the ubuntu installer include dmraid support?
[09:22] <cartucho> voice06: cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i swap
[09:23] <Sensae> np
[09:23] <Paddy_EIRE> does anyone know where I could get a copy of "libGL.so.1
[09:23] <POVaddct> H3b0R: i know nothing about bluetooth, not a single bluetooth device here
[09:23] <dom_f> Could anyone else runnign Edgy also check this for me please?  (Whether / shows up in df and mount)

[09:25] <dom_f> Anyone got any more ideas (I'm ripping my hair out!)  See https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/2293 for details.  Thanks.

[09:26] <computaMike> hey all - hope everyone here is doing well
[09:27] <Karark_> Sensae, you can see the refresh rates available in xorg.conf
[09:27] <josator> Sensae, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, then put your horSync And Vert parameters of your monitor
[09:27] <josator> (if it is not autodetected)
[09:27] <Sensae> I guess I'll try it again

[09:29] <cartucho> rhythmbox
[09:29] <rbil> too much
[09:29] <MrKeuner> rbil: xmms
[09:29] <rbil> something like xmms, but not that p.o.s.
[09:29] <Karark_> rbil, beep-media-player?
[09:29] <The_Machine> need some help with vmware if anyone has a moment
[09:29] <Kannix> Quick question: Does evolution use the "maildir" format? So if I backup my ~/Mail folder, will it be able to read it?
[09:29] <cartucho> if your xmms is broken go for bmplayer
[09:29] <LjL> beep media player+
[09:29] <fydo> yeah, xmms is the suck
[09:29] <LjL> !language
[09:29] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:30] <cartucho> Kannix: i think yes try to add an account and see the options
[09:30] <donfilipo> MrKeuner it's not but it is not hard to get and instaltion instruction's are there just don't forget the sudo
[09:30] <cartucho> Kannix: but your mail is not in imap format is ? so wont work
[09:30] <fydo> LjL: was that directed towards me?
[09:30] <fydo> or rbil?
[09:30] <Hexstream> Hi, I'm looking for the best way to remap the enter, tab, and right-ctrl keys. I already found some mappings in /usr/share/keymap, but alas the mappings for those keys doesn't seem to happen in those files.
[09:30] <Kannix> cartucho: I do not have evolution yet. I am planning to flatten my SuSE/KDE box for an ubuntu 6.10 with gnome/evolution.
[09:30] <MrKeuner> donfilipo: do you mean as a deb package
[09:30] <MrKeuner> donfilipo: or their own binary
[09:31] <Kannix> cartucho: But I do not want to lose all my email.
[09:31] <donfilipo> Mrkeuner no as bin file from real
[09:31] <cartucho> Kannix:  the easy and dirty way to do it is to send everything to gmail and get back
[09:31] <LjL> it was directed towards the swearing i've seen in the last few minutes. you all know what you said, so
[09:31] <josator> LjL, thx
[09:31] <ianmacgregor> !devede
[09:31] <POVaddct> Kannix: if you want to stay with kde, you can also try kubuntu
[09:31] <ubotu> devede: Video DVD creator. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 2.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 243 kB, installed size 664 kB
[09:31] <metellus> any idea how I can make the edgy install cd use my nvidia card instead of integrated graphics?
[09:32] <Kannix> POVaddct: Nope, I want to switch to Gnome. It has the nice paw ... and it is C-based. I like C. C++ is for ... well, for KDE :)
[09:32] <whazilla> hey
[09:32] <POVaddct> Kannix: hehe, okay
[09:32] <fydo> LjL: i think i missed something.. where is the swearing?
[09:32] <donfilipo> Mrkeuner and it works even in 6.10 if you only need that
[09:32] <izaskun> hola
[09:33] <voice06> anyone here know what would prevent Ubuntu from using the swap partition?
[09:33] <ianmacgregor> Why does the bot say devede is in multiverse but s earch in Synaptic shows nothing for devede (and yes, I have multiverse enabled)?
[09:33] <freach`> Kannix: evolution supports it i think, if not, copy your mails to an pop3d which supports maildir format an pop it
[09:33] <cartucho> voice06: i've just told you how to fix your problem
[09:33] <POVaddct> voice06: permanently or temporary?
[09:33] <whazilla> can somebody help me ... with my networkin trouble ?
[09:33] <hav0k> does anyone know anything about compiz with an ati card?
[09:33] <Kannix> freach`: That might be an option. But really, it makes me wonder why nobody has found a nice universal mail backup method yet.
[09:33] <black_13> does the kernel that you choose affect compilation of C/C++ based executeables?
[09:33] <grogoreo> how can I get my ~/bin folder to let me run scripts from it in the command line without having to put ~/bin/script.sh. I've had it work before in another distro ages ago

[09:34] <freach`> Kannix: you will never find any universal thing in linux
[09:34] <Kannix> freach`: I mean, at least the "open source" progs should be user friendly and make switching applications hassle free.

[09:34] <Kannix> freach`: Yeah, like TCP/IP is not universal. Or HTTP.
[09:34] <voice06> theres no other way for me to explain it
[09:34] <grogoreo> thanks cartucho and segfault_

[09:35] <freach`> Kannix: as log as human selffish stupid crap bla exist you will never find real universal protocols or software
[09:35] <kmaynard> sks, nope
[09:35] <POVaddct> voice06: which partition is it?
[09:35] <Kannix> sks: What exactly is your question?
[09:35] <kmaynard> sks, what kind of notebook
[09:35] <whazilla> anybody know howto solve networkin trouble in ubuntu ?
[09:35] <sks> i have asus l1b
[09:35] <cartucho> voice06: swapon /dev/partitiion
[09:35] <Kannix> freach`: I agree. But we could try?
[09:36] <grogoreo> where can I add bin to my path. I don't really want to put it on for the whole system, just really my user. Do I add it in the .bashrc? PATH=~/bin
[09:36] <Kannix> whazilla: What kind of trouble?
[09:36] <cartucho> voice06: but ubuntu is probably using the swap, its just another thing, cause when memory AND swap runs out, OS begins to kill stuff
[09:36] <cartucho> grogoreo: ~/.bashrc
[09:36] <hckrSid> Anyone know how I can set up acpi to ignore a certain event?
[09:36] <sks> i can hear audio from the jack in the front, but no from the internal speakers...
[09:36] <whazilla> got an ip ... but no route to host
[09:36] <whazilla> even not to router
[09:36] <freach`> Kannix: LSB is the best joke i ever heared, i think the lsb exists a long time, but redhat or suse still do their own lsb
[09:37] <voice06> POV hda3
[09:37] <fydo> LjL: just curious, do you think 'suck' is a swear word? ;)
[09:37] <POVaddct> voice06: sudo swapon /dev/hda3
[09:37] <grogoreo> cartucho: thanks. So can I just add:   PATH=~/bin  or do I have to enter all of this before hand: PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games
[09:37] <ianmacgregor> grogoreo: /bin should already be in your path
[09:37] <whazilla> only if u suck ;)
[09:37] <voice06> did, said the device is busy
[09:37] <computaMike> sks - a thought but is there a BIOS thing  that prevents the speakers from working?

[09:37] <Kannix> freach`: oh well. That's the way it goes then.
[09:38] <sks> computaMike: no, if i start knoppix live cd it works fine...
[09:38] <whazilla> what about asus lib ?
[09:38] <ianmacgregor> grogoreo: Ahh, ok, you didn't make that distinction so I misunderstood.
[09:38] <Sensae> I just went through and reconfigured the X server, and it's running fine with my different settings, but fglrx outputs this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29785/

[09:38] <Sensae> erm, fglrxinfo
[09:38] <luz> question: does ubuntu has firewall installed with system?
[09:38] <freach`> Kannix: but there is hope, as long as projects like debian or ubuntu exists, there is hope for a better world ;)

[09:38] <NET||abuse> what's a good ircd package?? one that's pretty nice to run and configure?
[09:38] <grogoreo> ianmacgregor: well I did but ~ before the /bin
[09:38] <grogoreo> *put
[09:38] <Kannix> freach`: ETA of my .iso is 34 min :)
[09:39] <metellus> anyone know how I can make the edgy install cd use my nvidia card instead of integrated graphics?
[09:39] <freach`> Kannix: dapper or edgy ?
[09:39] <Kannix> freach`: edgy.
[09:39] <computaMike> Can I ask - I am trying to compile (make) Asterisk from source - I downloaded the source from the Digium site, and have downloaded the development tools for Ubuntu - however I keep getting the error : You do not appear to have the sources for the 2.6.15-26-server kernel installed.  Apt-get only shows sources for 2.4 kernel..  I'm running 6.06 Server
[09:39] <cartucho> come on bring it on today is care day
[09:39] <Kannix> freach`: I am a debian-unstable guy :)
[09:39] <sks> kmaynard: thanks, is a good site... i go there and read all... i'll back in a few...
[09:39] <Sensae> Heh, I'm pretty impressed with Ubuntu, especially Edgy. I used to use Gentoo, I don't think I'm gonna be going back, lol.
[09:39] <freach`> Kannix: hmm i'm not very pleased with edgy
[09:39] <LjL> fydo: yup. well, depends on the context.
[09:39] <Kannix> freach`: why?
[09:40] <cartucho> computaMike: either compile a 2.6 and  break the hole system or change distros
[09:40] <freach`> Kannix: lot of problems
[09:40] <computaMike> but the 6.06 Ubuntu is 2.6 isn;t it?
[09:40] <Sensae> Anyone? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29785/ <-- fglrxinfo outputs that, although my xorg.conf says driver "fglrx"
[09:40] <fydo> LjL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_profane_words
[09:40] <Kannix> freach`: I have it running on my notebook. No problems (besides getting WPA WLAN to run, that was a bit of a strain).
[09:40] <cartucho> computaMike: i dont know, google for it, apt-cache search kernel
[09:40] <Sensae> Is that first error anything to worry about / causing problems?
[09:40] <cartucho> Kannix: install nm applet
[09:40] <hckrSid> Any acpi experts here?
[09:40] <cartucho> Kannix: works like windows
[09:41] <computaMike> right - i'll try google - thanks everyone
[09:41] <freach`> Kannix: ubuntu team said edgy is the developer guys super multimedia platform, but the stuff that does not work ist actually multimedia
[09:41] <donfilipo> abhijitb i am trying that for 2 days to achieve for real for ram's and for kaffeine for other files

[09:41] <cartucho> freach`: i bet you didnt installed mplayer
[09:41] <freach`> Kannix: problems with DVB tuner card, problems with sound card, problems with graphic card
[09:42] <freach`> cartucho: no i mean dvb tuner

[09:42] <cartucho> oh, ok
[09:42] <freach`> cartucho: i am a mplayer slave i do not use anything else
[09:42] <cartucho> freach`:  yep me too,
[09:42] <Sensae> -sighs- So hard to get help in here, though when I do it's good help
[09:43] <cartucho> freach`: since slackware 7.0
[09:43] <freach`> cartucho: problem is dvb interfaces are rare buggy and so is dvb, not rare but buggy
[09:43] <cartucho> freach`: i really avoid fancy hardware and stuffs
[09:44] <freach`> cartucho: mplayer got one too, on my dapper setopbox with mythtv i got no problems with it, but on edgy i wonder if something works
[09:44] <shiv> LjL: Can u help me with this https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/grub-installer/+bug/10661/comments/9
[09:44] <Dragonfire1> HI

[09:45] <shiv> LjL: I got the parted iso

[09:45] <Seeker2599> anyone know of a program i can use to run a windows program on ubuntu
[09:45] <Zaggynl> Can someone give me a hand with getting my microphone to work again?
[09:46] <cartucho> Sensae: your driver is not setup
[09:46] <Dregger> Seeker: Use WINE.

[09:46] <Seeker2599> can i get wine with apt get?
[09:46] <cartucho> Sensae: try this: grep fglrx /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:46] <Sensae> cartucho: What command sets it up, do you know?
[09:46] <Zaggynl> Seriously, my mic worked before
[09:46] <freach`> Seeker2599: yes
[09:46] <Seeker2599> ok ty
[09:46] <xerox> Hiya.
[09:46] <Zaggynl> right now I can hear myself talking EVEN after I muted my mic in alsamixer
[09:46] <Sensae> cartucho: driver "fglrx"
[09:46] <cartucho> Sensae: see if it returns something
[09:46] <MitchM> seeker2599: If you ever have a package question try apt-cache search first =)
[09:46] <Dregger> Alright, guys, I've got a ridiculously stupid question.
[09:47] <cartucho> Sensae: did you put the Composite "disable" line ?
[09:47] <Dregger> I can't figure out how to do landscape orientation in Edgy.
[09:47] <MitchM> hmm; not familiar with the program Zaggynl =(.
[09:47] <Dregger> For printing.
[09:47] <Zaggynl> darn
[09:47] <MitchM> Have you tried using a different mixer
[09:47] <MitchM> ?
[09:47] <tuxtux_> reboot
[09:47] <rc-1> please someone help me before it crashes :(
[09:48] <bigslam> lol
[09:48] <Dregger> Where's the page orientation option in the Edgy printing dialogue?  I converted a PDF to 2x1, but I can't actually get it to print out right.
[09:48] <Kannix> freach`: What hardware? I have no problems with sound or graphics and I do not own a DVB card.
[09:48] <bobbyyu> Besides defining my shares to my other Windows computer, what else do I have to do in order to make my shares availalble to my Windows computer?
[09:48] <bigslam> oh what kind of dvb card?
[09:48] <MitchM> rc-1: Probably a capacitor on the motherboard going out. If its under warranty try and replace it =).
[09:49] <MitchM> rc-1: and uh-- backup all your important stuff.
[09:49] <holzmodem> hi im want install Java6 JDK on EdgyEft, is there a deb Paackage avaiable?
[09:49] <rc-1> MitchM: thanks! my warrenty expires.... i think very soon if not already, going to call them now
[09:49] <pianoboy3333> Anyone here a developer of deluge?
[09:49] <crimsun> holzmodem: no, but you can make one with java-package
[09:49] <cartucho> pianoboy3333: try me
[09:49] <MitchM> rc-1: A dell?
[09:49] <POVaddct> holzmodem: did you get your usb stick problem solved?
[09:50] <bobbyyu> What do I have to do to make my computer recognise my Linux Samba shares?
[09:50] <bobbyyu> I mean my other computer
[09:50] <pianoboy3333> cartucho: ok, kool, how is deluge natively implemented putting the app in the taskbar, in contrast to using egg.trayicon?
[09:50] <MitchM> rc-1: If it's the motherboard you can probably find a cheap replacement under $100 to fix it right up.
[09:50] <cyzie> anyone have experience in gnuplot ? how do i set the scale so that it is always 5minutes apart?
[09:50] <rc-1> MitchM: yup, had it about a year, had 2 hard drives go bad, this, and other bad stuff :(
[09:50] <bobbyyu> Because the only tool that's on Ubuntu is "Shared Folders"
[09:50] <bigslam> or rc you can track down the problem on the mobo and repair it
[09:50] <MitchM> rc-1: Bet you the harddrive's went corrupt because of the bad motherboard =)
[09:50] <rc-1> im REALLY surprised ubuntu is almost OK when even the BIOS doesnt work hehe
[09:51] <pestilence> what kind of software do people use to create vector graphics, like adobe illustrator
[09:51] <MitchM> rc-1: ah yes. Must love the linux kernel.
[09:51] <MitchM> rc-1: Probably all your problems originated at the motherboard before.
[09:51] <bigslam> yes pestilence
[09:51] <hangfire> pestilence- Xara Xtreme is really good, its in add/remove programs
[09:51] <bobbyyu> Did anyone read my problem?
[09:51] <MitchM> rc-1: Could be also related to a bad power-supply.
[09:51] <pestilence> hangfire, ok, i'll check it out
[09:51] <pestilence> bigslam, huh?
[09:51] <sam_ubtoo> hi
[09:52] <MitchM> rc-1: Where the power-supply is destroying stuff... i.e hd's; and now your MB.
[09:52] <rc-1> at least i got lucky and JUST got a 500 GB external HD :) GNU game im developing, and tons of music backing up!!!
[09:52] <holzmodem> POVaddct, yes
[09:52] <bigslam> yes you use adobe illustrator to creat vector logos,graphics,ect ect
[09:52] <bigslam> create
[09:52] <Dregger> Is there a program I can use to rotate the pages in a PDF file?
[09:52] <MitchM> rc-1: Have dell send you a new powersupply also.
[09:52] <sam_ubtoo> :)does anyone know here wahts going on with the SCIM?
[09:52] <POVaddct> holzmodem: what was the problem? odd partitioning?
[09:52] <beligum> how do I batch-copy a file to a server, using ftp ?
[09:52] <pestilence> bigslam, i mean....what kind of open source programs do people use :)
[09:52] <pestilence> bigslam, of course people use illustrator...but i don't have that.
[09:52] <hangfire> hozmodem, Xara is more powerfull than Illustrator, Illustrator is big only because of big marketing
[09:52] <rc-1> MitchM: i dont know whats wrong, all i know is that it freezes once, i have to hard reboot, and then 1 min when i  turn it back on LOUD fan noise and smoke
[09:52] <rokerr> Should I be surprised that the Nvidia graphics driver in Add/Remove Software breaks X?
[09:53] <sam_ubtoo> ????????????????????????????????????????????????????
[09:53] <rc-1> almost had a heart attack
[09:53] <rokerr> rc-1: new powersupply
[09:53] <cilynx> Dregger: pdf90, it's part of the pdfjam package
[09:53] <whazilla> anyhow ... anyway to debug my network trouble ?
[09:53] <bigslam> oh lol
[09:53] <Dregger> Thanks!
[09:53] <MitchM> rc-1: Bad power-supply which surged a capacitor on your motherboard which is now causing your video-problems.
[09:53] <bigslam> check sf.net
[09:53] <pestilence> hangfire, it's xaralx ?
[09:53] <sam_ubtoo> ANYONE know anything about SCIM?????
[09:53] <MitchM> rc-1: Not a good situation =)
[09:54] <froh> why has Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus stopped working after upgrading to edgy?
[09:54] <pestilence> !scim
[09:54] <ubotu> Chinese, Japanese, Korean Language input. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SCIM
[09:54] <hangfire> no Xara Xtreme

[09:54] <MitchM> rc-1: Hopefully your still under waranty
[09:54] <leafw> I have a powermac with dual processor. Ubuntu-edgy-ppc installed just fine, but lshw reports my second CPU is disabled. ??? Any clues on how to activate it?
[09:54] <sam_ubtoo> ubotu i know what it is   i want to know why it aint working.
[09:55] <pestilence> hangfire, there isn't a package by that name, this is the closest i find:  http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/graphics/xaralx
[09:55] <rc-1> is it safe to keep using ubuntu (im going to do a complete reinstall after this) (ie. could haveing the comp on damage any other components>
[09:55] <cartucho> leafw: why would you use ubuntu if you've goy a mac, im just curious
[09:55] <jorgp> any eta on feisty uploads?
[09:55] <hangfire> pestilence, look in add/remove programs, under graphics
[09:55] <sam_ubtoo> pestilencedo you know why my input method aint working   it was working on the older version U i was running..
[09:55] <whazilla> !how do i diable network modules ?
[09:55] <pestilence> hangfire, ah...when you load up xaralx it comes up with the name "xara extreme" so it must be the same thing
[09:55] <HymnToLife> could anyone help me out with a DNS server ? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1700284
[09:55] <MitchM> rc-1: Yes. But turning the computer off/on repeatedly will do more damage.
[09:55] <hangfire> k
[09:55] <pestilence> sam_ubtoo, no clue....sorry
[09:55] <whazilla> !how do i diable network modules ?
[09:55] <sam_ubtoo> :-[
[09:55] <MitchM> rc-1: I'd either leave it on to do what you want; or just shut it off.
[09:56] <cartucho> whazilla:  rmmod ?
[09:56] <sam_ubtoo> does anyone here use SCIM
[09:56] <finalbeta_> IS there an IDE that support perl with code completion? Like if I wanted to use dbus, it would tell me what methods are available for me.
[09:56] <kmaynard> whazilla, are you trying to ask the bot?
[09:56] <leafw> cartucho : macs are not as flexible as linux.
[09:56] <MitchM> rc-1: May work fine... but if its a bad Power Supply you can end up damaging a lot more things...
[09:56] <rc-1> MitchM: wish i could just leave it on :( keeps crashing
[09:56] <whazilla> how do i disable network modules ? ... rmmod eth0 ?
[09:56] <cartucho> leafw: oh ok, i can see you are new :)
[09:56] <MitchM> rc-1: aye. Not good.
[09:56] <pestilence> whazilla, edit /etc/network/interfaces
[09:57] <leafw> cartucho : and linux runs FASTER (blender rendering for one)
[09:57] <MitchM> rc-1: Backup you stuff. Shut 'er down and call dell.
[09:57] <pestilence> whazilla, ifdown eth0
[09:57] <MitchM> your*
[09:57] <rc-1> wierd video defects too, like my mouse has a floating menu next to it, video is half lines like the bois, etc
[09:57] <cartucho> whazilla: ifconfig down
[09:57] <leafw> cartucho : I;'ve been using linux and openbsd for 5 years. ??
[09:57] <RememberPOL> Hey, is it possible to upgrade from 6.06.1 LTS to 6.10?
[09:57] <rc-1> MitchM: k thanks for the help and advice, doing now
[09:57] <cartucho> leafw: and still prefers it over a mac, your choice man :)
[09:57] <kmaynard> !upgrade > RememberPOL
[09:57] <MitchM> rc-1: Yup, anytime =)
[09:57] <leafw> cartucho : precisely.
[09:58] <cartucho> leafw: so the BSD comp is not enough ? neither the freebsd userland ?
[09:58] <RememberPOL> kmaynard: Will Firefox 2.0 be released for 6.06 LTS ?
=== kalila_ is now known as kalila
[09:58] <cartucho> RememberPOL: probably no
[09:58] <leafw> cartucho : so, any clues on why my second processor is not running? Does ubuntu not suport smp on macs?
[09:58] <kmaynard> RememberPOL, i dunno, but it's easy to get the package from mozilla.com and use it
[09:58] <cartucho> leafw: really dont know, ppc support is allways kinda messed uop
[09:58] <RememberPOL> cartucho: So the "Long term support" only implies security patches?
[09:59] <leafw> cartucho : I run mol from time to time, for two apps: photoshop and indesign.
[09:59] <cartucho> RememberPOL: kinda, no major version changing
[09:59] <cartucho> leafw: i wish i had a mac, its just to expensive here
[09:59] <cartucho> RememberPOL: "probably"
[09:59] <xerox> Anybody is running ubuntu on an intel iMac?
[09:59] <Sensae> Argh this is driving me crazy.
[10:00] <lostboyz> what is the best way to upgrade to edgy for xubuntu?
[10:00] <cartucho> Sensae: Composite line what is it ?
[10:00] <xerox> Last time I tried grub messed up something and I had to use the os x cd to make os x boot again.
[10:00] <hangfire> pestilence- lucky your using Linux, because you have to pay for Xara in Windows http://www.xara.com/
[10:00] <Sensae> cartucho: Exactly what you posted
[10:00] <leafw> cartucho : old macs are currently being thrown away here, if you want one come get it.
[10:00] <pestilence> hangfire, it does indeed seem pretty nice.  i think i'll use it :)
[10:00] <cartucho> Sensae: is it DISABLED or 0 ?
[10:00] <whazilla> what is a need to have in host file tobe able todo networkin ?
[10:00] <earthian> is there any chance to have another kernel version for ubuntu edgy ????? the current kernel is too buggy!
[10:01] <cartucho> leafw: buy me the ticket :)
[10:01] <Hoagie> Hey. I just got my Dapper Drake CD in the mail, but when I start the computer to boot it off the CD, it just hangs for a while, then goes straight to OS selection. Does my CD drive hate me, or is something else wrong?
[10:01] <Sensae> cartucho: Option "Composite" "Disable"
[10:01] <Roger_The_Bum> earthian: did you upgrade, or do a fresh install?
[10:01] <cartucho>        Driver      "fglrx"
[10:01] <cartucho>         Option      "VideoOverlay" "on"
[10:01] <cartucho>         Option      "OpenGLOverlay" "off"
[10:01] <cartucho> and this ?
[10:01] <finalbeta_> earthian, if it's buggy, patches will be released, and they might get backported.
[10:01] <whazilla> what is a need to have in host file tobe able todo networkin ?
[10:02] <Session> How can I check if I have an IRQ conflict?
[10:02] <Sensae> cartucho: Should all of those be in Section "Device" ?
[10:02] <earthian> Roger_The_Bum kernel 2.6.17 does not work with dmraid ... and my raid array is not working without dmraid
[10:02] <cartucho> Sensae: yes
[10:02] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell cartucho about paste
[10:02] <subposeJ> hello
[10:02] <cartucho> LjL: i know, my mistake
[10:02] <earthian> finalbeta_ there is 2.6.18.1 kernel.. why not use that one?
[10:02] <leafw> cartucho : found the answer to my problem, if you're interested
[10:02] <LjL> you're excused
[10:02] <jud> hey booting in recovery mode with edgy results with a root terminal???? isnt that a problem????
[10:02] <Sensae> cartucho: Those last two, VideoOverlay and OpenGLOverlay are missing, I'll add them and restart the X server
[10:03] <cartucho> leafw: ah no thanks i prefer not remembering macs exists
[10:03] <whazilla> !host file
[10:03] <earthian> i just have no idea how to make initrd image so that my freshly compiled kernel would load dmraid before trying to mount rootfs
[10:03] <rokerr> leafw: old macs for free? :)
[10:03] <Roger_The_Bum> cartucho: >_<
[10:03] <leafw> rokerr : yes.
[10:03] <erUSUL> earthian: with mkinitrd??
[10:03] <Roger_The_Bum> leafw: which processor?
[10:03] <whazilla> !no route
[10:03] <rokerr> leafw: i don't suppose it's anywhere near me. haha
[10:03] <leafw> Roger_The_Bum : several, mostly dual processor G4 500Mhz
[10:03] <rokerr> solid
[10:03] <cartucho> whazilla: oh god what is your problem anyway ?
[10:04] <leafw> it's in Dresden, Germany.
[10:04] <POVaddct> leafw: that's where i live
[10:04] <rokerr> leafw: shucks
[10:04] <pianoboy3333> cartucho: so?
[10:04] <earthian> erUSUL I do not know :P i have never made one and the howtos over the net are not quite concrete on how to make the initial ram fs just to load i.e. one package like dmraid... i just need dmraid there?
[10:04] <cartucho> pianoboy3333: so what friend ?
[10:04] <Session> Is there a command that check's if IRQ is in conflict? Can't get my network working. Suspect IRQ trouble. Had the same problem a few years ago on the same machine
[10:04] <leafw> POVaddct : then line up for a rendering machine (but it may be too slow for POV)
[10:04] <whazilla> cartucho i get connection ... but cant ping router
[10:04] <pianoboy3333> cartucho: how is deluge natively implemented putting the app in the taskbar, in contrast to using egg.trayicon?
[10:05] <POVaddct> leafw: yeah, i think so :)
[10:05] <Hoagie> Hey. I just got my Dapper Drake CD in the mail, but when I start the computer to boot it off the CD, it just hangs for a while, then goes straight to OS selection. Does my CD drive hate me, or is something else wrong? Anyone?
[10:05] <cartucho> pianoboy3333: i dont have any ideia i was joking
[10:05] <whazilla> i got a faulty vmnet1 interface i need to get rid off
[10:05] <whazilla> it uses loopback
[10:05] <subposeJ> Hi I just tryed ubuntu 6.10 from cd but it says theres that problem with my xserver loading... for an ati x600, can anyone help?
[10:05] <cartucho> whazilla: pvt
[10:05] <whazilla> only loopback has same ip as router
[10:05] <pianoboy3333> cartucho: .... this isn't a place for jokes, go to #ubuntu-offtopic for that
[10:05] <dimaka> hi
[10:05] <erUSUL> earthian: why not just compile dmraid in and not as module??
[10:05] <Seeker2599> do i run wine in the terminal?
[10:05] <Session> HoagieL: Go into your bios with delete button and choose boot from cdrom
[10:05] <POVaddct> whazilla: sudo ifconfig vmnet1 down
[10:05] <Sensae> cartucho: No more error but it's still running MESA
[10:05] <leafw> POVaddct : they make fine servers, with the dual processor.
[10:05] <lostboyz> how is upgrading i am trying to upgrade to edgy does gksu "update-manager -c" work well?
[10:06] <cartucho> Sensae: read /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:06] <Hoagie> Session: Thanks, I'll give it a go
[10:06] <earthian> erUSUL!?? is there a dmraid thing IN KERNEL? erm.. heh.. u sure?
[10:06] <cartucho> Sensae: look for a line that says disabling dri
[10:06] <erUSUL> earthian: 'mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.xxx.img 2.6.xxx'
[10:06] <dkr> lostboyz: worked for me (mostly)
[10:06] <earthian> if yea.. where?
[10:06] <earthian> i will compile it in
[10:06] <leafw> all one needed was the linux image powerpc-smp, which for some misterious reason was not the one the installer had chosen.
[10:06] <dimaka> sorry, some body knows any russian or ukrainian irc channels with ubuntu support?
[10:06] <lostboyz> dkr what did you have to tweek
[10:06] <dimaka>    ?
[10:07] <Seeker2599> do i run wine in the terminal?
[10:07] <Sensae> cartucho: I filtered to show just dri and see nothing that says that
[10:08] <ianmacgregor> Is anyone else having a problem where running winecfg in Dapper freezes the entire system?
[10:08] <cartucho> Sensae: try not case sensitive
[10:08] <subposeJ> Not sure... I need to know how to get to a command line from a black screen with a flashing cursor, so that i can enter any commands?
[10:08] <erUSUL> earthian: not sure checking now
[10:09] <cartucho> Sensae: its grep -i
[10:09] <subposeJ> <--- totally new to ubuntu and linux/unix...
[10:10] <variant> does anyone else have firefox create a netstat zombie process on their system? I have had that issue for YEARS and I have seen it mentiond on various google hits.. to check please do ps aux | grep netstat
[10:10] <firebird619> What is recommended as far as partitions for doing a clean install of Dapper? In the past I just went with what Ubuntu did, but now beings I'm doing a clean install, thought I'd ask what if anything else was recommended.
[10:10] <Sensae> cartucho: I see DRI init failed. Screen 0 is not DRI capable.

[10:10] <Session> Can anyone tell me how to check for IRQ collisions?
[10:11] <variant> firebird619: /boot / /home /var /tmp all valid for seperate parititons.. but it really depends on what you want
[10:11] <jud> <subposeJ>  that is called tilda
[10:11] <subposeJ> I only have one machine and no lan
[10:11] <jud> just install tilda
[10:11] <jud> but its not stable....
[10:11] <variant> firebird619: i would go with /boot (100mb) swap (500mb)  / (5gb) /home (the rest)
[10:11] <variant> firebird619: thats for a generic desktop system
[10:11] <subposeJ> is tilda like telnet?
=== Jbba2012 is now known as jzzat
[10:12] <variant> firebird619: and set /boot to be noauto in fstab  as there is no reason to have it mounted (you will have to rememebr to mount /boot before doing upgrades though)
[10:12] <bronze> Subhuman: yes...
[10:12] <earthian> erUSUL the mkinitrd -o output file tell me something that my /dev/mapper/via_kfsadf5 partition is not a lvm volume group or so... it is a swap partition.

[10:12] <ago> Do you know if ubuntu edgy package of mythtv was built with joystick support?
[10:12] <firebird619> variant:Ok, Thanks. I had Edgy installed but have had nothing but problems, specifically with graphics, etc. so going to try Dapper again.
[10:12] <earthian> boot is ../via_sdfasd1, swap is 5 and root is 6
[10:13] <jud> no telnet is a terminal on desktop.... like firstpersonshooter games

[10:13] <firebird619> variant: No, wiped the drive clean and going to install Dapper. I am on my Windows machine right now.
[10:13] <variant> firebird619: ok
[10:13] <bronze> subposeJ: both are "terminal connection to the system"  in that sense, for your purposes they are similar.

[10:14] <iter> ok I have a hoary install that I would like to upgrade to edgy-- should I go hoary-->dapper-->edgy or just hoary-->edgy
[10:14] <dkr> lostboyz: my upgrade aborted at one point and I had to start over.  second time it ran fine, though.  might have just been because I left it running overnight
[10:14] <crimsun> iter: the former

[10:14] <Daviey> sticazzi, i am using 'planner' right now
[10:14] <variant> can somone please run "ps aux | grep netstat" and tell me if netstat shows with a "z" (for zombie) this is getting a bit annoying
[10:14] <notwist> iter: i dont think you can skip one...
[10:14] <iter> crimsun: any rationale ?
[10:14] <jud> for ms project .. there is planner
[10:14] <crimsun> iter: in fact, that's not sufficient. You want hoary->breezy->dapper->edgy

[10:14] <jckdck> hi - i'm a ubuntu newbie - i'm having trouble with my wireless. I can see my network in the network manager - but it doesn't seem to connect (takes ages 'activating wlan0')
[10:15] <sticazzi> Daviey, thanks -- that's pretty much what I need
[10:15] <jckdck> does anyone know what this is/might be ?
[10:15] <ArneM> Hi everybody - I'm missing the device-file for my parallel port in Edgy (It was called parport0 in 6.06), now i've only got lp0 but my avrdude doesn't like it (it says: can't claim device)
[10:15] <crimsun> iter: upgrade paths are only tested for (most current stable)-1
[10:15] <rapha> Hi all!
[10:15] <iter> ok thanks
[10:15] <subposeJ> ok bronze so its like something running in the background! will that work or so i need to put ubuntu on my hdd, not from cd.
[10:15] <Daviey> sticazzi, literally "sudo apt-get install planner"
[10:15] <rapha> Is it possible to get Dapper-style keyboard layout back in Edgy_
[10:15] <Kannix> sticazzi: TaskJuggler? Gantt PRoject?
[10:15] <ArneM> how do I get my parport0 back?
[10:15] <notwist> jckdck: maybe there is some problem with the driver for your wlan card.. im a noob too but i dont know
[10:15] <bronze> subposeJ: no, its interactive. use it like a terminal.
[10:16] <jckdck> notwist - i think ure right ! --- ive no idea how to fix tho
[10:16] <Ayabara_> I need to mount an ext3 storage partition. can someone help me with the line I need in /etc/fstab?
[10:16] <jud> there is also an alternative to planner  on java that is working on every platform but dont know the name anmore
[10:16] <notwist> jckdck: find out who made your wlan card and google for a linux driver :)
[10:16] <jckdck> ok
[10:16] <firebird619> variant: I have been here in the #ubuntu channel more times lately since installing Edgy. It won't start half the time, gets stuck at a blank screen just past GRUB, etc. From what I have learned from getting help here, it is graphics related, either software or hardware, but either way the problem isn't getting fixed so trying Dapper to see what happens.
[10:16] <boink> and find out which chip that card uses
[10:16] <Seeker2599> how do i open a port for bittorrent to use
[10:16] <Ayabara_> now I have "/dev/sda3   /mnt/storage  ext3    defaults        0       2", but I don't think that is what I want
[10:17] <variant> firebird619: :/
[10:17] <variant> firebird619: dapper is cool
[10:17] <jckdck> ive got 6.06 install - is it work updating to 6.10 ?
[10:17] <freach`> ArneM: modprobe parport
[10:17] <firebird619> variant: It will be cool if it works. :-)
[10:17] <eXistenZ> How can I set my internal IP manually in ubuntu?
[10:17] <iter> firebird619: it's a driver problem, since changing to vesa fixed it, right ?
[10:17] <jckdck> dapper = ubuntu ?!
[10:17] <ArneM> ok - I'll try
[10:17] <Daviey> jckdck, dapper is the codename for a release.  As XP is of microsoft
[10:17] <Sensae> Anyone else here install the fglrx drivers?
[10:18] <rapha> Please I need help with keyboard layout! I always have to press SPACE before " and ' and ~ appears!
[10:18] <sticazzi> I've been installing loads of stuff lately -- all the packages downloaded, are they cleaned once the installation is successful or do they lie around, build mold and waste hdd space?
[10:18] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: what exactly do you mean by "internal ip"?
[10:18] <jckdck> Edgy Eft > Dapper ? or =
[10:18] <rapha> jckdck: mean me_
[10:18] <firebird619> iter: Vesa sort of fixed it. With Vesa, after I logged in, shortly thereafter it went to a screen that had ran fschk (which passed) and brought me right back to the login scree.
[10:18] <eXistenZ> POVaddct, I mean the IP assigned by the router.
[10:18] <jud> i did
[10:18] <minerale> existenz: ifconfig -ethX 1.2.3.4   where x is 0 or 1 on 2 etc depending on your device
[10:18] <notwist> jckdck: edgy is the latest
[10:18] <iter> sticazzi: apt-get clean
[10:18] <eXistenZ> POVaddct, I don't want it to be set by the DHCP server of the router
[10:18] <Ayabara_> can anyone help me with the mount options? pretty please with sugar on top :-)
[10:18] <firebird619> *screen
[10:18] <jud> fglrx
[10:18] <Daviey> sticazzi, they can waste space.  If you do sudo apt-get clean and sudo apt-get autoclean  it will clear them up
[10:18] <sticazzi> iter, thanks
[10:18] <Sensae> Anyone know how to get fglrx working right?
[10:19] <rapha> jckdck: new install of Edgy Eft, worked under Dapper
[10:19] <jud> has anyone lockup problem with fglrx
[10:19] <Seeker2599> how do i open a port for bittorrent to use
[10:19] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: do you want to set it once or permanently without dhcp?
[10:19] <brasse> Hello! Can anyone here tell me how I can make a program like splitmail send emails via a smtp server that I specify?
[10:19] <rapha> jud: only when I try to switch to VC
[10:19] <eXistenZ> POVaddct, permanently
[10:19] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: edit the file /etc/network/interfaces
[10:19] <jud> yes and reboot??
[10:19] <iter> firebird619: have you tried to disable gdm
[10:19] <Daviey> Seeker2599, is your machine on a network or connected directly to DSL?
[10:20] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: there also might be a gui tool, but it will sure change the same file
[10:20] <firebird619> iter: No, what would that do?
[10:20] <Seeker2599> im behind a router but not connected to any other computers
[10:20] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: you have to know which interface is the one connected to the router (for example  eth0)
[10:20] <iter> firebird619: gdm is what starts up and is crashing
[10:20] <eXistenZ> POVaddct, Got it! danke Frau POVaddct :)
[10:20] <iter> firebird619: disabling it will leave you at a nice text login
[10:20] <Sensae> Has anyone installed fglrx on Edgy?
[10:21] <iter> firebird619: then we can get xwindow sworking
[10:21] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: frau? ich tret dir gleich auf dein Z :)
[10:21] <eXistenZ> POVaddct, What is the Subnet mask?
[10:21] <eXistenZ> POVaddct, Gateway address is the router's address?
[10:22] <earthian> erUSUL nope. dmraid was reconfigured but mkinitrd still returns me an error: cannot find lvm device on my swap partition :S
[10:22] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: you have to know the subnet mask. in most cases its 255.255.255.0
[10:22] <POVaddct> eXistenZ: yes, Gateway address is the routers address
[10:22] <Sensae> Has anyone installed fglrx on Edgy?
[10:22] <brasse> or... perhaps it is possible to make sendmail send mail via my ISP's smtp server. Do anyone here know how to accomplish that?
[10:22] <earthian> and the dpkg-reconfigure updates the new 2.6.17 kernel instead the one i compiled 2.6.18
[10:22] <Seeker2599> Daviey: im connected directly
[10:23] <firebird619> iter: Ok. I would sure like to get Edgy working. I don't have it or anything installed right now, I wiped the drive clean. I can install Edgy again, would you want to help me out with getting it working?
[10:23] <iter> firebird619: I can for a bit sure
[10:23] <Sensae> -sigh-
[10:24] <firebird619> iter: Ok, but this will take a little while to get Edgy installed first.

[10:28] <EmxBA> is there any ubuntu bugs channel?
[10:28] <iter> Hoagie: and they all work except for the one you want ?
[10:29] <Kim^J> soundray: I KNOW about Shipit. No, I want to BUY the friggin cds.

[10:38] <Enselic> iter: Nope, not necessary
[10:38] <JuJuBee> What does it mean?
[10:38] <bobbyyu> Hi, I have some trouble configuring my Ubuntu to work on my network with a Windows computer
[10:38] <POVaddct> JuJuBee: libboobs? :)
[10:38] <iter> Enselic: you can just do du -hs
[10:38] <sith-lord> hi
[10:38] <bobbyyu> I set the shares in Shared Folders
[10:38] <godmaster> hello i have a problem, i want to install a theme but there is 3 files : icons, theme and wallpaper how to install this theme : http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=13548
[10:38] <JuJuBee> Don't ask me?
[10:38] <soundray> JuJuBee: boot to the grub menu and select the second option
[10:39] <bobbyyu> But I am blocked from Wdinwos
[10:39] <JuJuBee> K
[10:39] <mabus> Kannix: I was using top to find out what was using so much cpu... firefox and synaptic each used about 30, but when I closed them, everything else still runs slow
[10:39] <tarelerulz> Thanks for the  link ubotu I will read what it has to say.
[10:39] <JuJuBee> I'll be back, hopefully to say fixed...TTFN
[10:39] <Enselic> iter: that is not overviewal enough for a the whole directory tree imo :/
[10:39] <bobbyyu> Is there a utility to configure my Samba shares?
[10:39] <Enselic> soundray: thanks, ill try it otu
[10:39] <iter> Enselic: right I figured as much
[10:39] <shinmen> Hey guys, I did an upgrade to edgy on server and now the vlan interfaces are named vlan52@eth0 instead of just vlan54.
[10:39] <godmaster> how to install the mac osx theme?
[10:39] <sith-lord> good
[10:39] <shinmen> Any ideas on what changed made that? Or what workarround can I use to change it?
[10:40] <bobbyyu> !samba
[10:40] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[10:40] <bobbyyu> Please?
[10:40] <azureal> new/diff question: how would I compile my kernel by first changing the config file?
[10:40] <shinmen> Because /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/vlan is the one setting the set_set_name_type.
[10:40] <iter> azureal: make menuconfig?
[10:41] <godmaster> hello i have a problem, i want to install a theme but there is 3 files : icons, theme and wallpaper how to install this theme : http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=13548
[10:41] <Kannix> mabus: Hmm ... what is sucking up CPU now, according to top?
[10:41] <soundray> bobbyyu: System-Administration-Shared folders
[10:41] <dutchy> bobbyyu: i thought ubuntu had an app for it by default? somewhere in the admin menu
[10:41] <dutchy> bobbyyu: yeah what soundray said
[10:41] <Sensae> Yay! After a full system reboot the fglrx drivers seem to be working (They display in fglrxinfo) What would be the best way for me to double-check I have 3D acceleration?
[10:41] <bobbyyu> I did that
[10:41] <iter> Sensae: glxinfo | grep direct
[10:41] <io_pcg> I'm new....don't be angry with my question...lol
[10:41] <Enselic> soundray: Hmm, it was not quite what I thought off
[10:42] <iter> Sensae: are you running xgl ?
[10:42] <iter> Sensae: if you are that first command will always report no
[10:42] <Enselic> soundray: WinDirStat allows me to select a dir, then it scans the dir and collect informatino of the size of each dir/subdir/size
[10:42] <bobbyyu> I already configured my shares
[10:42] <io_pcg> I already install my g++ library but I don't know how to execute it!?
[10:42] <soundray> Enselic: man du
[10:42] <bobbyyu> My problem is that my Windows computer asks for a password
[10:42] <bobbyyu> when I try to activate my Samba shares
[10:42] <Enselic> soundray: du is not overviewal enough
[10:42] <Sensae> iter: No xgl, not going to run it. I want 3D accel to run some games through Cedega, or atleast try. And it reports yes.
[10:42] <azureal> iter, actually where is that config file
[10:43] <iter> Sensae: then you are confirmed to have 3d running
[10:43] <Sensae> Awesome.
[10:43] <soundray> Enselic: I often do something like "du -x | sort -n" to find what takes up space within a filesystem
[10:43] <Sensae> Next I'm going to install Cedega, if I can get enough of the games I play running I'm probably going to completely switch over to linux.
[10:43] <iter> azureal: you have to run that in the dir which contains the makefile for your new kernel
[10:43] <bobbyyu> Do you get my problem?
[10:43] <iter> azureal: usually /usr/src/linux
[10:44] <GyrosGeier> soundray/Enselic, for graphic output there is also xdu
[10:44] <Sensae> Atleast as soon as a linux distro supports my system. For some reason every distro I try locks up and won't even boot a liveCD
[10:44] <azureal> iter, i want to edit a text file, then have it compile, is that possible?
[10:44] <TheFuzzball> what is the version number of ubuntu after 6.10?
[10:44] <iter> azureal: of course haha
[10:44] <mabus> Kannix: nothing, it's not being used much
[10:44] <Enselic> soundray: Ah that's better, thanks
[10:44] <iter> azureal: it's called a Makefile
[10:44] <azureal> iter, no, makefile is not the one
[10:44] <io_pcg> I already install my g++ program with synaptic, but I don't know how to execute it, anyone could help me please?
[10:44] <iter> azureal: check /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.17 (or whatever is appropriate)
[10:44] <mabus> Kannix: except xorg taking up like 10-20% which is higher than normal, but still, it takes me like 30 seconds to get the run program dialog to come up
[10:44] <Kannix> mabus: then there must be another reason for sluggishness ...
[10:45] <azureal> iter, the file with all the CONFIG_blah=y   stuff
[10:45] <azureal> where is it
[10:45] <soundray> TheFuzzball: probably 7.04
[10:45] <Seeker2599> Daviey: are you still there and can you help me
[10:45] <mabus> Kannix: yes
[10:45] <Kannix> mabus: Do you have any applications running that you can shutdown?
[10:45] <webmaren> i can't get sound to work in totem
[10:45] <LjL> io_pcg: i'm not sure you understood. you did what?
[10:45] <soundray> TheFuzzball: assuming that it will be released in April 2007
[10:45] <bobbyyu> Nobody got my problem?
[10:45] <Sensae> Anyone know where the vnc4server conf file is? I don't remember.
[10:45] <Kannix> mabus: Kill one non-essential process after the other, till you find what's wrong.
[10:45] <TheFuzzball> soundray, yea it will
[10:45] <godmaster> how to install a theme please !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[10:45] <iter> azureal: it's usually called .config
[10:45] <zlack> godmaster: in what window manager?
[10:45] <jzzat> does anyone know where i can ge the pen drivers for the Fujitsu stylistic
[10:46] <iter> azureal: in same dir as kernel src
[10:46] <azureal> iter, ah! nice, hidden rofl
[10:46] <Kannix> mabus: What is your kernel by the way? Is it SMP capable?
[10:46] <TheFuzzball> soundray, it's called Feisty Fawn I just didn't know the version number :)
[10:46] <azureal> iter, so after backing up .config and editing it, you're saying make menuconfig will read it?
[10:46] <soundray> TheFuzzball: don't be too certain. "6.04" was postponed to June in February
[10:46] <iter> azureal: no use make oldconfig for that
[10:46] <ubuntu__> Hi folks, I'm trying to setup Ubuntu to use a network printer being shared by WindowsXP, the printer is a lexmark p6350... can anyone help me find the correct driver? It is not in the default list of lexmark drivers
[10:46] <iter> azureal: menuconfig is ncurses to creat a new config
[10:46] <godmaster> in gnome
[10:47] <Seeker2599> how can i open a port fr bittorrent to use? my machine is directly connected to my modem, not on a network
[10:47] <bobbyyu> I used Shared Folders" but it doesnt work!
[10:47] <RobNyc> MasseR, how is it going dude
[10:47] <Seeker2599> for*
[10:47] <zlack> godmaster: System -> Prefeences -> Theme
[10:47] <io_pcg> LjL I installed the programe c++ and I don't know how to execute it...
[10:47] <TheFuzzball> soundray, ""Ubuntu 7.04, scheduled for release on 19 April 2007
[10:47] <godmaster> i want to install this theme bit i dt know how, its mac osx theme http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=13548
[10:47] <TheFuzzball> soundray, anyway, thanks :)
[10:47] <azureal> iter, ok, so I backup .config, edit it, then pretend like i'm reverting to an old config?  crafty =P
[10:47] <godmaster> zlack i try in theme but it dt runs
[10:47] <sc0tt> hey folks
[10:47] <zlack> godmaster: dt runs ?
[10:47] <webmaren> i can't get sound to work in totem
[10:48] <godmaster> there is 3 files
[10:48] <godmaster> desktop, theme and icons ?
[10:48] <iter> azureal: yep
[10:48] <iter> brb toilet
[10:48] <zlack> godmaster: just drag the tgz or tar.gz into the theme window
[10:48] <azureal> iter, ok sweet thx
[10:48] <io_pcg> I'm new...it's stupid question...but I don't know how to do it :S
[10:48] <godmaster> there is 3 tgz
[10:48] <noxxle> how can i check the size of my swap file
[10:48] <zlack> so theme is the general theme file, icons is for the icons
[10:49] <Paddy_EIRE> is there anyone who could help me sort out my ati graphics card
[10:49] <bobbyyu> !samba
[10:49] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[10:49] <zlack> noxxle: df -h
[10:49] <jatt> bobbyyu: you have a linux share and you want to access it from a windows machine?
[10:49] <bobbyyu> That right
[10:49] <azureal> oh, btw, would it be bad to edit my current kernel in this manner (edit .config, then make oldconfig)
[10:49] <azureal> ?
[10:49] <jatt> bobbyyu: and you don't know which password to write when in windows you are asked for it.
[10:50] <alecjw> Paddy_EIRE: try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg in the terminal. if that soesn't work, i can't help
[10:50] <bobbyyu> Right again
[10:50] <jatt> bobbyyu: I had a similar problem, I assigned a password to my user on my linux box with the
[10:50] <jatt> smbpasswd
[10:50] <jatt> command.
[10:50] <noxxle> df - h doesnt work
=== tich_ is now known as bradley__
[10:50] <Paddy_EIRE> alecjw: will that help me enable direct rendering???
[10:50] <io_pcg> LjL: did you understand the question?
[10:50] <zlack> noxxle, without the space, df -h
[10:50] <alecjw> ah
[10:50] <alecjw> i thought you menat to actaully just drive it, Paddy_EIRE
[10:50] <Seeker2599>  how can i open a port for bittorrent to use? my machine is directly connected to my modem, not on a network
[10:51] <Paddy_EIRE> oh no
[10:51] <soundray> ubuntu__: it's unlikely that this printer will work with Linux. Best to print to PDF and print those from Windows. There is a shareware print server that does that for you
[10:51] <JuJuBee> Ok I rebooted into recovery mode and used visudo to edit the sudoers.  Not sure what I should have entered?  I duplicated the root entry and changed root to my username.  I restarted and still cannot use the users and groups manager...
[10:51] <bobbyyu> Can you show me how to do it, jatt?
[10:51] <jatt> bobbyyu: sure, which is the username where your linux share resides?
[10:51] <noxxle> i know ther eis no space "df -h" doesnt work
[10:51] <noxxle> doesnt show swapfile
[10:51] <alecjw> Paddy_EIRE: ati GPU's aren't very well supported in linux, you probably won't be able to get it to do much
[10:51] <steveire> Does gnome have an equivalent to kdes kparts?
[10:51] <bobbyyu> As far as I know, I use bobbyyu all the time
[10:52] <noxxle> i need to know the size of my swap file!!
[10:52] <Paddy_EIRE> alecjw: on a previous install i was able to play enemy territory and other games now I cant
[10:52] <alecjw> oh....
[10:52] <|rt|> noxxle: no such thing as a swap file in linux...there is a swap partition
[10:52] <savvas> hello, does anyone know how to limit network connections? i'm currently interested in ircd
[10:52] <jatt> bobbyyu: well logged in as bobbyyu you just do
[10:52] <jatt> smbpasswd
[10:52] <jatt> and it should ask you for a new password, if you haven't assigned one.
[10:52] <noxxle> thats what i meant
[10:52] <POVaddct> noxxle: linux doesnt use swapfiles (at least in the standard config)
[10:52] <noxxle> jeeez
[10:52] <JuJuBee> Can anyone help me with users-admin?
[10:52] <iter> azureal: should be fine, but why not use menuconfig if you're going to do that anyway
[10:52] <noxxle> what is the size of my swap partition? how can i check
[10:52] <alecjw> i don't know much about ATI, sorry Paddy_EIRE, i have an nvidia
[10:52] <zlack> noxxle: no need to shout, lets see
[10:52] <tarelerulz> I used ntfs-3g and samba to share my fat32 hard and my ntfs windows partition over my home network.
[10:53] <feg> noxxle, cat /proc/swaps
[10:53] <|rt|> noxxle: try typing free
[10:53] <Paddy_EIRE> alecjw: sounds like I need one of them
[10:53] <noxxle> ok thank you
[10:53] <zlack> noxxle: and be patient - we are all here on a volunteerly basis
[10:53] <bobbyyu> Could not connect to machine 127.0.0.1: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
[10:53] <bobbyyu> Failed to change password for bobbyyu
[10:53] <azureal> iter, oh, i'm just following someone's options (which are in a text file)
[10:53] <|rt|> noxxle: that will tell you how much physical and virtual memory your system has and how much it's using
[10:53] <bobbyyu> That what it says
[10:53] <azureal> iter, make oldconfig...and now  'sudo make' or what?
[10:53] <noxxle> i was also wondering if its possible to defrag an external usb harddrive that has formated to fat32 from ubuntu?
[10:53] <bobbyyu> Should I type sudo?
[10:54] <jatt> bobbyyu: what does
[10:54] <jatt> ps -ef | grep smb
[10:54] <jatt> say?
[10:54] <jatt> bobbyyu: (don't paste the output here)
[10:54] <mabus> Kannix: whatever kernel the xubuntu desktop install cd runs on
[10:54] <soundray> noxxle: the best way to defrag is to back up, format and restore.
[10:54] <Moee> Hello :] 
[10:54] <Moee> Fier nouveau user d'Ubuntu :] 
[10:54] <azureal> ooh iirc make modules, then make modules_install
[10:55] <noxxle> soundray are u joking?
[10:55] <Kannix> mabus: should be fine.
[10:55] <rednelb> Whoo hoo! Gonna try running UBUNTU embedded!   http://www.vmware.com/products/player/    http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/ubuntu.html  Thx for the suggestions, all that helped me.
[10:55] <Seeker2599>  how can i open a port for bittorrent to use? my machine is directly connected to my modem, not on a network
[10:55] <mabus> Kannix: Yeah I know that, I've run xubuntu/ubuntu on tons of machines, tons of times. The reason I'm here is because it is *not* working like it should. :)
[10:55] <iter> haha M$ is having a tech fair this afternoon here
[10:55] <iter> gonna go try to win a xbox360
[10:55] <bobbyyu> It not working
[10:55] <phillip> anyone have a ZVM working in linux?
[10:55] <iter> whoops
[10:55] <ubuntu> Okay, so if I want to use a PDF printer instead, and just copy the files to the Windows machine for printing, how do I access the Windows smb share? Right now I can see it but not open it
[10:56] <rednelb> iter: they have onenote on display too?
[10:56] <iter> wrong channel
[10:56] <bobbyyu> Darnit
[10:56] <iter> probably yea
[10:56] <noxxle> so i cannot defrag an external fat32 partition? how am i supposed to backup 150 gigs on this drive then format it? thats not practical
[10:56] <ubuntu> Do I have to install samba? or smbfs?
[10:56] <soundray> noxxle: no
[10:56] <bobbyyu> Still locked out of my Windows system
[10:56] <ianmacgregor> noxxle: Can't you defrag it from Windows?
[10:57] <soundray> noxxle: if you haven't got a way to backup your 150GB, you're not following best practice, anyway. Get a backup drive.
[10:57] <frederick85> i like bunting the buntu
[10:57] <Kannix> mabus: I meant "ok" in context of my question for SMP.
[10:57] <jatt> bobbyyu: strange, I haven't found such error before. What I did (yesterday) with edgy was to share my folder through nautilus. At that point, nautilus downloaded some additional packages for samba. Then I had a lot of trouble trying to find which damn :) password I need to type in my windows machine. With smbpasswd I could solve that problem.
[10:57] <Kannix> mabus: I have no idea, why your system is "slow", if top shows no real CPU usage besides the xorg at 20%.
[10:58] <soundray> noxxle: especially if you're entrusting your data to a flaky filesystem like fat32
[10:58] <mabus> Kannix: is there a way I can see if it's seeing *both* processors?
[10:59] <mabus> Although even at just one 1.4ghz processor it should run better than this
[10:59] <Seeker2599> will some one please stop ignoring me, ive asked my question 4 times and no one has payed attention
[10:59] <POVaddct> mabus: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[10:59] <mabus> POVaddct: thanks
[10:59] <dabaR> !repeat
[10:59] <ubotu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[10:59] <noxxle> lol i dont have a windows parition
[10:59] <lmosher> My sound is no longer working in Ubuntu. I am not certain why, volume is all the way up.
[10:59] <noxxle> pure linux
[10:59] <noxxle> but need external usb just in case
[10:59] <noxxle> for friends with windows
[10:59] <JuJuBee> Can someone please help me with users-admin problem?
[10:59] <JuJuBee> I cannot run it.
[11:00] <dabaR> why
[11:00] <mabus> POVaddct: it shows the info on one, but how do I know if it's seeing two
[11:00] <soundray> noxxle: then backup, format *to ext3*, restore, and never worry about defragging again.
[11:00] <noxxle> cant i just convert it to ext3?
[11:00] <soundray> noxxle: no
[11:00] <noxxle> i converted ntfs to fat32 on this drive
[11:00] <jatt> lmosher: after a breezy->edgy upgrade?
[11:00] <POVaddct> mabus: then it is only seeing one. you probably have a uniprocessor kernel.
[11:00] <noxxle> well why not?
[11:00] <noxxle> parition magic can do that stuff
[11:01] <JuJuBee> dabaR : you say why to my users-admin ? ?
[11:01] <lmosher> jatt, no I haven't switched to edgy yet
[11:01] <dabaR> JuJuBee: yes, why can you not open it?
[11:01] <JuJuBee> I get an error.
[11:01] <dabaR> what is it
[11:01] <phillip> testing testing can anyone read this?
[11:01] <jatt> lmosher: did you tried alsamixer? and to restart the sound settings with
[11:01] <jatt> /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
[11:01] <jatt> ?
[11:01] <soundray> noxxle: feel free to try with Partition Magic. Most likely, it's going to mess things up. Backup, format... I've said it before.
[11:02] <Seeker2599> phillip: yes i can
[11:02] <mabus> !edgy
[11:02] <phillip> ok thanks
[11:02] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[11:02] <eXistenZ> What's the best media for backups?
[11:02] <noxxle> is there a linux program i can use
[11:02] <bobbyyu> Can I install and run kcontrol from Ubuntu?
[11:02] <JuJuBee> dabaR : An error occurred during your last KDE upgrade leaving an orphaned control module You have an old third party module lying around
[11:02] <JDahl> has someone here found a workable patch for openafs with the default Edgy kernel?
[11:02] <mabus> When is edgy officially released? Or has it been already?
[11:03] <JuJuBee> It doesn't tell me which one...
[11:03] <mabus> topic.. right
[11:03] <coz_> mabus, already released
[11:03] <ianmacgregor> mabus: Already released
[11:03] <lmosher> * Shutting down ALSA...  * warning: 'alsactl store' failed with error message 'alsactl: save_state:1190: Cannot open /var/lib/alsa/asound.state for writing'...[fail] 
[11:03] <noxxle> anyone know of a linux program for converting paritions??
[11:03] <mabus> I thought they were released every 6 months?
[11:03] <jatt> lmosher: hmmm that doesn't look good
[11:03] <azureal> iter, i'm still not sure what to do after "make oldconfig"
[11:03] <lmosher> jatt, nm, I didn't use sudo
[11:03] <mabus> noxxle: download gparted, and boot of of it. You can't create partitions on disks you are using, so you can't easily do it while running another OS
[11:03] <jatt> lmosher: and with sudo?
[11:03] <eXSiR> lmosher: use with sudo
[11:03] <JuJuBee> dabaR : this is under KDE, under Gnome, It just told me I am not allowed to, not even as root
[11:03] <azureal> iter, googling returns different methods of compiling =/
[11:03] <ubuntu> Do I have to install Samba before I can access Windows shares? I can see the share but not open it
[11:03] <coz_> mabus, well whenever they are released, I don't know ,, but edgy is aledy out there
[11:03] <Seeker2599> does anyone know how to route a port?
[11:04] <lmosher> ok I restarted, still no sound
[11:04] <firebird619> iter: I have installed Edgy now. When it finished, I clicked restart now instead of Continue with live CD. It opened the CD drive so I could remove the CD, but it is just sitting there.
[11:04] <lmosher> alsamixer has all settings on full
[11:04] <iter> azureal: check README in /usr/src/linux-whatever
[11:04] <dicon> anyone has tried cedega on Edgy?
[11:04] <iter> azureal: has all the cmds in it
[11:04] <jzzat> Hey, I'm soon to revieve a Fujitsu stylistic and found the fpit drivers, but its vague on what start up script to add the pen detection code in any help/
[11:04] <noxxle> mabus i want to convert an external usb
[11:04] <ianmacgregor> noxxle: ntfs and fat{16,32} are Windows file systems (and not very good ones). I doubt you will find a Linux app to convert a crap fs to ext3 and do the job well.
[11:04] <soundray> eXistenZ: that's hard to answer just like that. It depends on how much money you're willing to spend, how long you're going to store the data for, how quickly you need access, how often you are going to backup....
[11:04] <iter> firebird619: restart with ctrl-alt-del
[11:04] <firebird619> I pressed Ctrl+Alt+F1 and it the last line on the screen says rebooted from gdm menu.
[11:04] <dicon> anyone has tried cedega on Edgy??
[11:04] <noxxle> lololol
[11:04] <noxxle> cedega works great
[11:04] <mabus> noxxle: oh, then fdisk
[11:04] <firebird619> iter: Ok, will do that now.
[11:04] <noxxle> fdisk? i dont have a windows partition
[11:05] <mabus> ok...
[11:05] <lmosher> noxxle, So?
[11:05] <noxxle> does fdisk have a gui
[11:05] <eXistenZ> soundray, home usage
[11:05] <soundray> eXistenZ: for most home/office/light use, hard disks are currently the best option.
[11:05] <mabus> noxxle: not that I know of
[11:05] <dicon> noxxle, did u test it on edgy?
[11:05] <jatt> lmosher: how are you testing your sound? With which application? Could you try to play a .wav file with aplay, and adjust the volumn with alsamixer only?
[11:05] <mabus> it's a pretty simple program, you shoudln't need one
[11:05] <coz_> jzzat, fujitsu,, wel first you have to find out if it suport the wacom tablet drive,, well then again it may not have to,,, xorg comes with the wqcom driver already installed for pentablet it just needs to be configured
[11:05] <eXistenZ> soundray, Thanks!
[11:05] <noxxle> fdisk for converting fat to ext3? i dont want to format and lose data
[11:05] <lmosher> jatt, I was using xmms, it shows that it's playing (from the mixer)
[11:05] <lmosher> noxxle, Why don't you copy the data first?
[11:05] <coz_> jzzat, that is actually the wacom driver
[11:05] <azureal> iter, they're headers, with no readme
[11:05] <noxxle> i have used cedega on edgy
[11:05] <mabus> noxxle: you will lose data if you're changing filesystems... back up the data
[11:05] <noxxle> mabus i didnt loose the data when i converted from ntfs to ext3
[11:06] <dicon> noxxle, which version of cedega?
[11:06] <JuJuBee> dabaR : Any suggestions?
[11:06] <noxxle> i mean from ntfs to fat
[11:06] <noxxle> dicon the newest
[11:06] <dabaR> no
[11:06] <mabus> noxxle: well I'm suprised, and I don't know how that works. Must be a windows thing.
[11:06] <noxxle> why wouldnt cedega work?
[11:06] <mabus> But back up your data.
[11:06] <soundray> eXistenZ: best to have two in USB external cases, and store one of them at work or at a friend's place.
[11:06] <coz_> jzzat, it will be interesting to see how this works ona pen tablet... i prefer pen talbets to most other types of portables
[11:06] <lmosher> mabus, Yeah there's a windows utility that converts it.
[11:06] <PlanarPlatypus> Hi, I am trying to set up dspam as a content filter on postfix, I have it relaying the mail properly and dspam definately sees the mais as it adds the sig to the bottom of the mails.  However dspam_stats gives me no training data.  Does anyone have any idea what I am missing?
[11:06] <lmosher> noxxle, why can't you just copy your data from the drive?
[11:06] <noxxle> no its too much
[11:06] <dicon> noxxle, whats the newest please?
[11:07] <jatt> lmosher: you could also test to play an mp3 file with the mpg123 command line utility (just to be sure xmms is not failing in some way).
[11:07] <noxxle> 5.2.6 and 5.2.7
[11:07] <noxxle> i was playing anarchy online
[11:07] <mabus> noxxle: ntfs is not reallly that workable with linux, I am quite sure that you cannot format a ntfs partition back to fat without losing your data, and if there is such a utility, it is definately not on linux
[11:07] <firebird619> iter: It is just sitting there, It rebooted and went through GRUB, but after that just sits at a blank screen.
[11:07] <iter> azureal: just do make && make modules_install && make install
[11:07] <dicon> noxxle, hum.. where could i download them?
[11:08] <noxxle> mabus its called parition magic for windows. and yes i converted ntfs to fat and lost NO data
[11:08] <iter> firebird619: ok we've been here before, let's stop gdm from starting
[11:08] <Cadteach> Hi all
[11:08] <noxxle> dicon what? its not free
[11:08] <iter> firebird619: go back to grub menu by rebooting and boot recovery mode
[11:08] <mabus> noxxle: partition magic is not "for windows".. it's its own bootable system in it's own right...
[11:08] <firebird619> iter: Ok
[11:08] <ubuntu> When I try to open a SMB share, ubuntu refuses because it says the filename indicates it is of type desktop icon, but it's really of type smb share, so it's a security risk. It won't open the share. What do I do?
[11:08] <dicon> noxxle, hm.. how did u get it? o.o
[11:08] <coral> how can i repeat a slideshow automaticly in Open Office?
[11:08] <noxxle> mabus partition magic is the name of a program
[11:08] <azureal> iter, ok, thx, hopefully i can get my sound back =P
[11:08] <noxxle> mabus google it plz
[11:09] <JuJuBee> Can anybody tell me how to correct my problem with users-admin?
[11:09] <noxxle> www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/
[11:09] <noxxle> that right there
[11:09] <noxxle> dicon google cedega
[11:09] <noxxle> you buy it
[11:09] <mabus> noxxle: I'm familiar with partition magic. No need to be rude.
[11:09] <noxxle> mabus well why dont you believe me
[11:09] <ianmacgregor> JuJuBee: What is the error you get when you try to run user-admin?
[11:09] <mabus> noxxle: believe you about what?
[11:09] <iter> mabus: well you're splitting hairs
[11:09] <JuJuBee> Tells me I am not allowed to
[11:09] <iter> partition magic is definitely a windows program
[11:09] <firebird619> iter: Ok, its booted to recovery mode.
[11:10] <ianmacgregor> JuJuBee: Try: gksu users-admin
[11:10] <JuJuBee> Only since the upgrade to edgy last night.
[11:10] <soundray> noxxle, mabus, iter: please ask yourselves whether your discussion is still on topic.
[11:10] <JuJuBee> I will try...
[11:10] <mabus> I have a bootable partition magic cd right next to me...
[11:10] <iter> firebird619: ok now issue update-rc.d -f gdm remove
[11:10] <mabus> I can run it, and I don't have windows on my box.
[11:10] <firebird619> iter: Ok, did that.
[11:10] <mabus> Unless the "for windows" thing is an actual .exe that is separate from the bootable cd and that I have never heard of it.
=== Valombre is now known as [-NoX-] 
[11:10] <iter> firebird619: ok no errors right? reboot with 'reboot'
[11:11] <dicon> noxxle, thanks man :D
[11:11] <JuJuBee> ianmacgregor : "You are not allowed to access the system configuration."
[11:11] <mabus> Which would be thoroughly confusing and they really should have called it something else, but anyway...
[11:11] <firebird619> iter: no errors.
[11:11] <Cadteach> I have a question about programs auto-starting, specifically GAIM. Any idea how to stop it?
=== [-NoX-]  is now known as Valombre
[11:11] <POVaddct> mabus: yes, there is a separate thing. it can generate a bootable floppy and cd though.
[11:11] <soundray> JuJuBee: have you created more than one user on your box?
[11:11] <mabus> noxxle: In that case, get the bootable partition magic cd, if partition magic can do it. And then it doesn't matter if you have windows.
[11:11] <ianmacgregor> JuJuBee: and you ran that with 'gksu users-admin'? Did it ask you for a password?
[11:11] <JuJuBee> No.  Just my onw and root
[11:12] <JuJuBee> s/onw/own
[11:12] <JuJuBee> ianmacgregor : no password...
[11:12] <JuJuBee> something broken...
[11:12] <JuJuBee> me thinks
[11:12] <ianmacgregor> JuJuBee: I think something's broken too
[11:13] <mabus> noxxle: so are you saying that you have used partition magic to transform a ntfs partition into fat and not lost data, and vice versa? Or only one way?
[11:13] <ianmacgregor> noxxle, mabus Can we take the parition magik discussion to another channel please?
[11:13] <Daviey> noxxle, why use partition magic and not Gparted?
[11:13] <noxxle> lolol
[11:13] <firebird619> iter: just sitting at a blank screen.
[11:13] <JuJuBee> When I try to run from system setting (KDE) it spits something about the last time i upgraded KDE there were orphaned modules... Try removing them, but it doesnt tell me which ones...
[11:13] <soundray> JuJuBee: boot in recovery mode again, and create a new user with admin rights: 'adduser newadmin' ; 'adduser newadmin admin'. Then reboot, login as that user and try admin tasks.

[11:14] <firebird619> iter: I pressed spacebar and now I have where I can login.
[11:14] <JuJuBee> soundray : ok, thanks I will try.
[11:14] <JuJuBee> Thanks for the try inmacgregor...
[11:14] <iter> firebird619: good good
[11:15] <iter> firebird619: so now edgy is installed
[11:15] <JuJuBee> I'll return...
[11:15] <firebird619> iter: Yes.
[11:15] <iter> firebird619: let's get your video card working
[11:15] <iter> what's the model again ? 400g ?
[11:15] <firebird619> iter: My card is built-in Intel. i810
[11:16] <alecjw> is it possible to transver .m4v videos to my ipod using gtkpod?  when i try to import a .m4v, it says that i need to recompile it with an extention - this didn't happen with the previous version.
[11:16] <iter> oh right that was someone else
[11:16] <Tim90> Hi POv
[11:16] <Anderz> Anyoone installed a brother MFC-210C printer with brothers drivers and got it to work under 6.10? If you wanna change the device from /dev/usb/lp0 to /dev/usblp0 is it enough to change it in /etc/cups/printers.conf?
[11:16] <NET||abuse> hehehehe
[11:16] <NET||abuse> i got beryl working on my beast
[11:17] <NET||abuse> it's soooo fast
[11:18] <iter> firebird619: ok tell me what you get from 'grep command /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom'
[11:18] <ephesius> im trying to setup a cs source server on my ubuntu server but everytime i try to execute ./hldsupdatetool.bin i get a file not found error
[11:18] <dabaR> Anderz: did you try?
[11:19] <Daviey> ephesius, is the file set to executable and are you in the same folder?
[11:19] <jacek> clear
[11:19] <Anderz> yeah, but it won't print out
[11:19] <e_machinist> Hi, I'm trying to compile GnomeSword 2.1.7 in dapper from source. I type ./config, and it reaches "Checking for GNOME...", and then just stops and returns me to the command line.
[11:19] <frederick85> 4dmire my fub4r haxx0r Skillz
[11:19] <e_machinist> Does anyone know why it is doing this?
[11:19] <firebird619> #gdmflexiserver --command="UPDATE_CONFIG <confguration key>"
[11:19] <Skygge_> hey, does anyone know if apt etc keeps a log of package history?
[11:19] <dabaR> Anderz: then its not enough
[11:20] <Sixer> Hi, howcome /dev/fb0 is unrecognized in the default installtion of Edgy ?
[11:20] <iter> firebird619: ok that didn't help :) let's do 'apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel'
[11:20] <LjL> Skygge_: dpkg does. /var/log/dpkg.log
[11:20] <JDahl> is there a point in filing a bug for openafs-client,  if the problem is already known by openafs developers?
[11:20] <firebird619> Before that is: # command to get the GDM daemon to notice the change. Any running GDM GUI.
[11:20] <Sixer> i945 chipset running the i810 driver
[11:20] <soundray> e_machinist: are you sure that this isn't what it's meant to do?
[11:20] <Skygge_> thanks Ljl
[11:20] <iter> Sixer: AIGLX perhaps?
[11:21] <iter> dunno really
[11:21] <Sixer> iter: What's that mean?
[11:21] <soundray> e_machinist: btw, any particular reason you want to compile it, rather than installing an ubuntu package?
[11:21] <firebird619> iter: the pc I have Edgy on is not connected to Internet right now. Does that command need the Internet or can that be installed from the Edgy CD.
[11:21] <e_machinist> soundray, yah, the Readme claims that the configure should take a while, and create a huge list of options checks and what not. But it doesn't for me, just returns me to the command line.
[11:21] <iter> firebird619: should work from cd
[11:21] <JuJuBee> soundray: I'm back and sorry to say that I still cannot run users-admin, even using the newly created user.
[11:21] <firebird619> ok, will enter that command. standby.
[11:22] <e_machinist> soundray: The newest version of GnomeSword is 2.1.7, in the repositories I can only find 2.1.5. On the other hand, I know that 2.1.7 is in the edgy repositories?
[11:22] <soundray> e_machinist: won't 'sudo apt-get install gnomesword' do for you?
[11:22] <e_machinist> Is there a backports that I may not have enabled or something?
[11:22] <soundray> e_machinist: are you on edgy?
[11:22] <JuJuBee> I can run other system admin tasks.  THink its a problem with users-admin.
[11:22] <e_machinist> I'm on 6.06, the LTS release.
[11:22] <soundray> JuJuBee: same error message?
[11:22] <JuJuBee> Yes
[11:22] <fabio_> sorry what version of gnome there is in edgy?
[11:22] <bdragonmsl> 2.16
[11:23] <firebird619> iter: :-( says couldn' tfind package xserver-xorg-video-intel.
[11:23] <firebird619> * couldn't find
[11:23] <iter> firebird619: rats must need internet then

[11:25] <iter> firebird619: ok run 'startx'
=== Echtor2oo3 is now known as testOr
[11:25] <JuJuBee> soundray : ok...
[11:25] <LjL> u4a: perhaps if i knew what that did...
[11:25] <soundray> JuJuBee: then try again
[11:25] <firebird619> iter: Ok, it did that.
[11:25] <e_machinist> soundray: yes. And when I can't, there is usually something missing, etc. This one just... stops and returns me to the command line. So, I'm not exactly sure what I'm missing.
[11:25] <JuJuBee> Ok, thanks
[11:26] <e_machinist> soundray: Just says "Checking for GNOME..." and then returns to the command line

[11:27] <soundray> JuJuBee: sorry, out of ideas
[11:27] <e_machinist> soundray: ah, yah, didn't think of that. Let me give it a go.
[11:27] <coz_> jzzat, did  you get that?
[11:27] <LjL> u4a: works in edgy. doesn't work in dapper.

[11:29] <ronin2> LjL: it installs a printer.  any time I print to that printer, it makes what I'm printing into a PDF document.
[11:29] <soundray> cyzie: LjL's tip is better
[11:29] <ronin2> alecjw: from Firefox

[11:34] <sticazzi> is it worthwile installing binary drivers for ATI? x.org supplied seem to get the job done..
[11:36] <soundray> sticazzi: stick with xorg if you're happy. Only if you need fancy 3D stuff, Xgl etc. will you need fglrx

[11:38] <whoppix> hey all :) i have a little problem, regarding dapper drake.. i want to run PerlEdit, but i get the error :" error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" i cant find any corresponding versions of libstdc++ in my packet sources, so anyone any suggestion how to fix this? thx for help in advance :)
[11:38] <Paddy_EIRE> I downloaded firefox 2 and wish to use that from now on im using dapper...will java support and flash still install properly if the firefox directory is extracted to /home/myname/packages/firefox/
[11:38] <Commander-Crowe> Hi I just installed 6.10 and I'm getting no soud
[11:38] <lee78> vpnclient connects and once I disconnect i cannot connect again
[11:38] <Commander-Crowe> sound*
[11:39] <Sensae> I'm trying to run Legacy Doom and I'm getting GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference. What is that?
[11:39] <Commander-Crowe> last version I had sound
[11:39] <JDahl> is there an easy to way download a Debian unstable package?  They ship a very new and patched openafs-client, which supposedly builds fine with recent kernels
[11:39] <lee78> my ethernet card won't respond as well after running vpnclient
[11:39] <JDahl> I mean, the source package of course
[11:40] <LjL> cyzie: "pdftopnm filename.pdf | pnmtopng >filename.png"
[11:40] <LjL> cyzie: not tried
[11:41] <cyzie> LJL, source file is ps and i want it to be png :) why is it pdf ?
[11:41] <sethk> JDahl, you can download it the same way you can download any file.  right click in the browser, for example
[11:41] <LjL> cyzie: sorry, made confusion. just s/pdf/ps/ everywhere in that example
[11:41] <cyzie> okie, thaks
[11:42] <hysj> Hello, I could need some help in changeing the locals from utf-8 (if anyone can understand what i mean, not good at this :P)
[11:42] <JDahl> sethk, it has too many dependencies for that - I was hoping to use apt-get source on Debian's repositories without wrecking my Ubuntu installation
[11:42] <Karark_> Having troubles with ubuntuforum:  I log in but am automatically logged out when browsing or the page refreshes... I have deleted all cookies... what else can I try?
[11:43] <cyzie> pstopnm: Writing ppmraw file
[11:43] <cyzie> pnmtopng: EOF / read error reading magic number
[11:43] <sethk> JDahl, you said you wanted to download it.  sounds like you really want to install it, not download it
[11:43] <cyzie> LJL seem like error :-s
[11:43] <cyzie> pstopnm looks fine, the part screw up is pnmtopng :-s
[11:43] <sethk> JDahl, dpkg can do that for you
[11:44] <JDahl> sethk, to be more specific, I want to build an Ubuntu package from the Debian unstable source package
[11:44] <soundray> cyzie: it's not as easy as LjL suggests. You'll have to have a look at the manpages, at least man pnmtopng
[11:44] <sticazzi> I'm testing out the remote desktop feature connecting using the tightvnc viewer from windows over LAN, and it's slow as hell..
[11:44] <JDahl> sethk, it can? thanks... I will check that out
[11:44] <sticazzi> is this normal?
[11:44] <hysj> *got problems chaning lanuage in ubuntu :P
[11:44] <cyzie> man does nto give any example :-s soundray
[11:44] <sethk> sticazzi, yes, VNC is a real dog
[11:44] <LjL> soundray: uh... actually i was going to suggest the problem would probably be with pstopnm. like not having gs installed, or pstopnm not behaving like a normal netpbm command since a ps can have many pages, or something...
[11:45] <|rt|> sticazzi: depends on the network....you may have better luck with rdesktop
[11:45] <Commander-Crowe> !sound
[11:45] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[11:45] <billytwowilly> what was the name of that horror movie where it was some house that a mill owner that used child labour used to own?
[11:45] <sticazzi> |rt|, what's rdesktop?
[11:45] <soundray> billytwowilly: sounds like Krabat, but highly off-topic here
[11:46] <cyzie> LJL i have gs installed.
[11:46] <sticazzi> is it something compatible with windows terminal services (aka RDP)?
[11:46] <coldboot> What file specifies the search order for X video drivers? Or just X drivers in general?
[11:46] <billytwowilly> soundray: krabat? It was american..
[11:46] <billytwowilly> soundray: 1990's movbie..
[11:46] <hysj> okay, where is the enviroment folder or the locale-gen file?
[11:46] <hysj> :P
[11:47] <Commander-Crowe> anyone?
[11:47] <cyzie> woot!  got it works :d
[11:47] <Commander-Crowe> no one?
[11:47] <cyzie> LjL, soundray  pnmtopng image.pnm > image.png
[11:47] <soundray> billytwowilly: any problems with Ubuntu that we can help with?
[11:47] <Commander-Crowe> help ME!!!
[11:48] <soundray> cyzie: a two step process then, I suspected that
[11:48] <hysj> I got a problem with ubuntu, i can't remember how i changed from utf-8 to nb_no.iso-8859-1
[11:48] <cyzie> pstopnm plotexp.ps | pnmtopng <need to replace the input file here before pipe>   > filename.png
[11:48] <soundray> Commander-Crowe: your sound stopped working as you upgraded to edgy?
[11:48] <Karark_> Having troubles with ubuntuforum:  I log in but am automatically logged out when browsing or the page refreshes... I have deleted all cookies... what else can I try?(using firefox 2.0 on edgy)
[11:49] <sethk> Karark_, try a different browser, see if the behavior changes
[11:49] <soundray> cyzie: in that case, you should probably replace the '|' with a ';'
[11:49] <{_-IcE-_}> hey guys, can anyone tell me how to forward a host to a specified destination ? (localhost)
[11:49] <{_-IcE-_}> resolv.conf?
[11:49] <LjL> soundray, cyzie: yeah... pstopnm doesn't output to stdout by default (it can be made to), since a ps can have many pages, that are output to different pnm files
[11:49] <sethk> cyzie, usually if you leave out the name, it reads standard in by default
[11:49] <cyzie> soundray, nope
[11:50] <whoppix> {_-IcE-_}, try /etc/hosts
[11:50] <LjL> sethk: yes but the problem is that the other command doesn't write to stdout
[11:50] <Commander-Crowe> soundray: yes
[11:50] <sethk> LjL, ok, didn't know that
[11:50] <Daviey> {_-IcE-_}, edit your /etc/hosts file to hard code routes
[11:50] <soundray> Commander-Crowe: what hardware?
[11:50] <Commander-Crowe> soundblaster Audigy LS
[11:50] <sethk> Daviey, no, hosts has nothing to do with routes
[11:51] <sethk> Daviey, hosts is for name resolution
[11:51] <soundray> Commander-Crowe: do you know which modules it used to load in dapper?
[11:51] <{_-IcE-_}> Daviey & whoppix : tnx, thats what i was lookin for
[11:51] <cyzie> sethk, does not work that way for that pn case
[11:51] <LjL> sethk: true but that's probably what he was really asking about -- if by "host" he meant a hostname
[11:51] <Daviey> sethk, balls!  if your put in a dns (ie localhost) and a new ip then it woul;d 'hardcode' it
[11:51] <crimsun> Commander-Crowe: pastebin ``lspci -vn && amixer''
[11:52] <LjL> Daviey, that's not a route. technically he's quite right.
[11:52] <sethk> Daviey, no, the route exists already, you are just translating the name to an IP
[11:52] <sethk> Daviey, that can be shown easily by ping'ing the ip, without anything in /etc/hosts
[11:52] <Daviey> LjL, sethk, hosts comes priorty over DNS
[11:52] <LjL> Daviey: and routes have nothing to do with DNS
[11:52] <sethk> Daviey, irrelevant, but, that's controlled by /etc/nsswitch.conf
[11:52] <sethk> Daviey, either can have priority
[11:52] <Homer_Linux> hiya ppl upgraded from dapper to edgy everything went ok ish but now when i try to start a gnome session i dont have any taskbar/panels
[11:52] <Daviey> LjL, did my answer to the OP answer his question
[11:53] <sethk> Daviey, and, having priority doesn't change anything anyway
[11:53] <Daviey> sethk, okay you win, you having a bigger dick
[11:53] <sethk> unless one source is wrong, of course
[11:53] <LjL> Daviey: probably, because he posed the question in the wrong terms. but now stop insisting that you're right, because you aren't.
[11:53] <sethk> Daviey, no, I just know something about this.  don't take things personally.
[11:54] <soundray> Homer_Linux: can you start a terminal?
[11:54] <Karark_> sethk, epiphany does the same thing.
[11:54] <sethk> Karark_, interesting.
[11:54] <kamazeuci> anybody can help?: trying to connect to internet with a nokia CDMA cell/modem i get "NO CARRIER".
[11:54] <Karark_> sethk, and very annoying
[11:54] <drbashir> I cannot change any settings of the standard provided screensavers... and actually are there any that would actually be interesting (and no porn please)
[11:54] <sethk> Karark_, any connection problems?  could just be congestion anywhere down the line.
[11:54] <sethk> Karark_, yes, I'm sure it is very annoying.
[11:54] <Paddy_EIRE> hey I manually installed Firefox 2 in Dapper and was wondering how I could have it behave like before with the launchers only requiring "firefox" to be entered instead of me having to point exactly to the path
[11:55] <Karark_> sethk, nope, everything else works perfectly... just the forum is screwy
[11:55] <black_13> i am using ubuntu as vmware guess and im having problem getting netowrk connectivity can anyone offer me a solution/advice?
[11:55] <sethk> Karark_, you can run a packet sniffer and find out which side is breaking the connection, but that's rather tedious
[11:55] <cyzie> pstopnm plotexp.ps | pnmtopng  <1>  > filename.png           // how can the result of before pipe  "pipe" into <1>   ??
[11:55] <sethk> Karark_, odds are it's something at the forum end, then
[11:55] <cyzie> woot sorry
[11:55] <Homer_Linux> yeah from the desktop ,i can also on in to xfce session (everything ok in here )
[11:55] <SB|nblracer> Hi guys
[11:55] <SB|nblracer> need some help again
[11:56] <soundray> Homer_Linux: see if you can start gnome-panel from a terminal
[11:56] <SB|nblracer> why wont the JAVA HOME remember its path
[11:56] <SB|nblracer> I have to ttell it every time, i use this program
[11:56] <sethk> SB|nblracer, you have to add it to an initialization file, usually $HOME/.bashrc
[11:57] <cynical> Paddy_EIRE: well that only works when files are in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin, but I think you could create a symbolic link to get the same effect
[11:57] <soundray> SB|nblracer: how do you launch your java program?
[11:57] <Daviey> sethk, even though the new default is dash sh?
[11:57] <sethk> Daviey, the new default for what?
[11:57] <SB|nblracer> soundray i do it through the console/terminal window
[11:57] <Paddy_EIRE> cynical: would i do this with the cp command
[11:57] <soundray> Commander-Crowe: can you do what crimsun suggested?
[11:57] <Daviey> sethk, console.... in edgy it aint bash
[11:57] <Paddy_EIRE> ?
[11:57] <SB|nblracer> sethk can you go in more detail
[11:58] <sethk> Daviey, no, sorry, but sh is just an alias to bash
[11:58] <mandelum> hello? I just installed a RC1 version of Edgy, can I, should I and how can I update?
[11:58] <crimsun> Commander-Crowe: still waiting on the pastebin url
[11:58] <httpdss> need help on log file size ... i have to to analize a 11Gb /var/log/messages .... huge !! isnt it? seems someone forgot that logrotate existed... any suggestions on what can be done to analize it ? (i only have ssh access to that server, yes server :S ))
[11:58] <sethk> SB|nblracer, you add to .bashrc something like:   export JAVA_HOME=/wherever
[11:58] <cynical> Paddy_EIRE: no, you arent copying the binary file to /usr/bin, you are creating a link to it
[11:58] <Daviey> sethk, your wrong.  in edgy it a symlink to dash
[11:58] <Paddy_EIRE> ok
[11:58] <sethk> Daviey, you are assuming that the existence of one link means that there are no other links, which isn't true.
[11:59] <sethk> Daviey, and dash is a shell symbol, not a file or program.
[11:59] <SB|nblracer> what is bashrc and where is it located sethk?
[11:59] <Paddy_EIRE> cynical: would I beable to do this in the gui
[11:59] <sparr> SeanTater: dash is /bin/dash :)
[11:59] <sethk> SB|nblracer, in your home directory, starting with a dot:   .bashrc
[11:59] <Paddy_EIRE> cynical: with the /usr/sbin
[11:59] <sparr> sethk: ^^
[11:59] <SB|nblracer> thanks
[11:59] <sethk> SeanTater, right, I forgot that
[11:59] <Daviey> sethk, wrong
[11:59] <cynical> Paddy_EIRE: no
[11:59] <kamazeuci> anybody knows how to bypass "NO CARRIER" error while trying to connect to internet with an external modem?
[11:59] <Paddy_EIRE> cynical: how do I do that then
[11:59] <sparr> sethk: you realize the default sh changed to dash from bash in the latest ubuntu release?
[12:00] <cynical> Paddy_EIRE: you would type ln -s /usr/bin/firefox /opt/firefox/firefox
[12:00] <sethk> sparr, no I didn't notice, because I don't use either.
[12:00] <soundray> kamazeuci: dial the correct number
[12:00] <sparr> sethk: interesting.  whats your sh?
[12:00] <sethk> sparr, but that's good, bash has poor ksh compatibility
[12:00] <sethk> sparr, zsh
[12:00] <sparr> hmm
[12:00] <Paddy_EIRE> cynical: /opt/firefox/firefox being where ever I have firefox Installed
[12:00] <Commander-Crow1> um
[12:00] <sparr> didnt know zsh provided sh capability
[12:00] <kamazeuci> soundray: yes i am... its #777 the same I am using now with windows...
[12:00] <sethk> sparr, which isn't to say that there aren't other good shells, but that's the one I like.
[12:00] <Commander-Crow1> my connection died
[12:01] <cynical> Paddy_EIRE:  yes
[12:01] <sethk> sparr, yes, it has compatibility modes for ksh, sh, cshell, even bash if you have scripts with bash nuttiness in them.
