[12:01] <meeuro1_> checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[12:01] <meeuro1_> when trying to install gyachi
[12:01] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell meeuro1_ about build-essential
[12:01] <meeuro1_> any clue why that happens?
[12:01] <meeuro1_> i moved it to root
[12:01] <Refoyl> I have a friend with an Intel Pentium 2, 231 MHz, 64 RAM, 1.7GB disk who wants to try Unix.  I suggested Ubuntu.  If he installs a server version, will it fit?  Will the i386 version run on his Pentium 2?
[12:01] <boink> !build-essential
[12:02] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[12:02] <boink> Refoyl: yes, the ubuntu server will run on an old Pen II box
[12:02] <NChief> where can i find system Requirements for Ubuntu 6.10?
[12:02] <boink> though, 1.7 gig HD is nothing
[12:03] <Refoyl> boink, thanks.  I assume I should choose Dillo, AbiWord, and xubuntu-desktop, right?
[12:04] <boink> for xubuntu? hmm, I don't know if that would be enuf
[12:04] <boink> for the plain server, it could be enuf
[12:04] <boink> use the alternate install CD
[12:04] <boink> I installed xubuntu on a Pen III laptop, works quite well
[12:05] <Refoyl> boink: I am familiar with fvwm2, which ought to fit ok, instead of xubuntu.
[12:05] <boink> or even twm
[12:05] <Refoyl> boink: why do you suggest the alternate install CD?
[12:05] <boink> dillo can provide very basic surfing
[12:06] <boink> the standard CD may not work on such an old box
[12:06] <NChief> I hvae old IBM(450mhz) and a 8x CD-ROM.. I cant boot the ubuntu6.10 CD fine.. and loading screen, but after a while the monitors turns black(with a blinking '-') and nothing happends..
[12:06] <Martincho> how can I do that a binary file to be accesible from any place?
[12:06] <Refoyl> boink: Thanks.  Good night.
[12:06] <boink> NChief: use the alternate install CD
[12:06] <__mikem> Does anyone know of any Open Source Graphing software that can graph implicit equasions
[12:07] <NChief> boink: hmm. ok, I'll try taht thnx :)
[12:07] <Syn_Flood> hello :)
[12:07] <Martincho> like, I have a game in /home/martin/game, and I want to run it just typing "game" in the terminal, in any directory
[12:08] <Staz> you need to add that diectory to $PATH
[12:08] <Staz> directory*
[12:08] <manchicken> Anybody know how to get libmtp working in amarok?
[12:08] <Martincho> oh, but I must edit any file?
[12:09] <Staz> yeah ~/.profile
[12:09] <Martincho> something like the autoexec.bat from dos?
[12:09] <Martincho> ah
[12:09] <Syn_Flood> I just installed GdhcpD and it's saying i need to run it as root.  I'd like to do a sudo and run it but i can't find where the program is installed.   Suggestions?
[12:09] <bimberi> Martincho: alternatively, create a ~/bin directory and symlink to the game executable from there
[12:09] <eXistenZ> Are there no tabs in nautilus?
[12:09] <meeuro1> what am i doing wrong installing gyachi. I moved the file to root. Then i did cd /gyachi-1.0.5 to get into the directory. Then i hit ./configure and it does a few things and sais configure: error: C compiler cannot create executablesconfigure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[12:09] <meeuro1> 
[12:09] <eXistenZ> Is there any plugin to enable tabs or whatsoever?
[12:10] <Staz> Martincho : I think it's export PATH=$PATH:"~/martin/game/"
[12:10] <bimberi> meeuro1: install build-essential.  Ubuntu doesn't install with a C compiler
[12:10] <meeuro1> is build-essential the package name?
[12:10] <meeuro1> sudo apt-get install build-essential ?
[12:11] <bimberi> meeuro1: yes
[12:11] <Martincho> ok, thanks, I'll try it
[12:11] <bimberi> meeuro1: and that was badly phrased sorry - Ubuntu doesn't install a C compiler by default
[12:11] <meeuro1> thanks alot bimberi
[12:11] <bimberi> meeuro1: yw :)
[12:11] <meeuro1> should work after i get build essential installed right?
[12:11] <adam_> well, i just switched to kde... lets see how this goes
[12:12] <bimberi> meeuro1: i'm confident but not overconfident :)
[12:12] <meeuro1> lol
[12:12] <meeuro1> @ bimberi do i need to run build essential or just do the ./configure command in the firectory?
[12:13] <_Genrl_Zo> ok i downloiaded flash
[12:13] <_Genrl_Zo> now im in rtwermianl
[12:13] <Yokanzo> i followed the instructions for frostwire
[12:13] <Yokanzo> but its not working
[12:13] <_Genrl_Zo> ho do i make it so i can install this file from desktop
[12:13] <bimberi> meeuro1: just redo the ./configure
[12:13] <_Genrl_Zo> in ubuntu
[12:13] <Yokanzo> i also cannot update to 6.06 because it tells me it failed to calculate the upgrade
[12:13] <_Genrl_Zo> liek how do i naviage to home/noob/desktop
[12:13] <pcgigabyte012> Hello all. here is my question. I play java based games. They load fine but there very slow. Anyone know of a way to fix it?
[12:13] <Syn_Flood> how can i find where a program is installed at? or edit a start menu link that will make the programs launch using sudo?
[12:14] <bimberi> _Genrl_Zo: cd /home/noob/Desktop (note capital D)
[12:14] <Yokanzo> anyone know why my 5.10 wont update to 6.05?
[12:14] <LjL> Yokanzo: because there's no such version as 6.05 ;-)
[12:14] <meeuro1> bimberi got *** Could not run GTK+ test program and  Could not run GLIB test program and got this on the bottom configure: error: X development libraries not found
[12:14] <segosa> doies the server iso of ubuntu require the internet for installation?
[12:14] <segosa> does*
[12:15] <LjL> segosa: not that i know of
[12:15] <segosa> okay
[12:15] <bimberi> Syn_Flood: dpkg -L package | grep bin     shows where bin files in the package were put.  use gksudo in the command line for programs requiring superuser
[12:15] <germfy> Hi, any1 could help me? I've just updated from Dapper to Edgy, but my computer now is really slow.... It takes ages for it to load the programs....
[12:15] <bimberi> segosa: no
[12:15] <crimsun> meeuro1: install libgtk2.0-dev
[12:15] <bimberi> thanks crimsun :)
[12:16] <Syn_Flood> sweet thank you
[12:16] <Yokanzo> sorry I meant 6.06LTS
[12:16] <Yokanzo> I can't update to it
[12:16] <Yokanzo> it says "cannot calculate upgrade"
[12:16] <meeuro1> crimsun installing now thanks :-)
[12:16] <Yokanzo> unresolvable issue
[12:16] <Yokanzo> What am I gonna do now?
[12:16] <__mikem> LjL, do you know of any open source graphing programs I could use to graph implicit equasions
[12:16] <Yokanzo> I can't even run frostwire, nothing happens
[12:16] <_Genrl_Zo> ahh cool mate
[12:16] <_Genrl_Zo> thanks
[12:16] <TLE> Is there a certain convention to the whole /mnt/ and /media/ thing, because I sure can't seem to figure it out. I mean something like that media is just used for removeable media and mnt for the rest. Or is it just an old ambiguity ?
[12:17] <bimberi> germfy: run 'top' in a terminal and see if there's something taking lots of CPU
[12:17] <_Genrl_Zo> ok i did cd home/noob/Desktop
[12:17] <_Genrl_Zo> and i got
[12:17] <_Genrl_Zo> No such file or directory
[12:17] <LjL> __mikem, i guess you'd need an algebra system for that
[12:17] <bimberi> _Genrl_Zo: try ''cd ~/Desktop''
[12:17] <jrib> TLE: /mnt is supposed to be for temporary stuff I think.  google for 'FHS'
[12:18] <TLE> jrib: ok thanks
[12:18] <Yokanzo> Could not calculate the upgrade
[12:18] <Yokanzo> A unresolvable problem occured while calculating the upgrade. Please report this as a bug.
[12:18] <meeuro1> crimsun installed that now i got the programs but this is at the bottom now checking for X... no
[12:18] <meeuro1> configure: error: X development libraries not found
[12:18] <Yokanzo> what am I supposed to do about this?
[12:18] <crimsun> meeuro1: what is it looking for? Post config.log
[12:19] <LjL> __mikem, qalculate has some (limited) algebra system features built in, and it can graph, so perhaps try that
[12:19] <_Genrl_Zo> ha works
[12:19] <__mikem> alkright
[12:19] <_Genrl_Zo> so to naviagte all i do is cd ~
[12:19] <__mikem> oops stupid keyboard
[12:19] <germfy> bimberi: If there's no new process running, everything seems normal, if I try to run a NEW process, it takes ages to run...
[12:19] <_Genrl_Zo> then slash and dir name
[12:19] <LjL> __mikem: get qalculate-gtk or qalculate-kde, not just qalculate
[12:19] <Azerith> greetz all
[12:19] <meeuro1> crimsun the entire config.log?
[12:19] <crimsun> meeuro1: pastebin, yes
[12:20] <meeuro1> crimsun pastebin?
[12:20] <crimsun> meeuro1: /topic
[12:20] <Yokanzo> Anyone able to help me?
[12:21] <Yokanzo> i really am clueless about why my ubuntu won't update
[12:21] <enkidu> What does "lower Enter key" means ?
[12:21] <bimberi> _Genrl_Zo: ~ is a shortcut to the home directory of the logged in user
[12:21] <settler> can anyone recommend a good gui program for authoring a DVD
[12:21] <meeuro1> crimsun i pasted it
[12:21] <crimsun> meeuro1: url?
[12:22] <bimberi> germfy: i'm not sure then sorry :|
[12:22] <settler> I have devede qdvdauthor avidemux but cant seem to author a dvd with multiple movies on it
[12:22] <meeuro1> crimsun http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31327/
[12:22] <Yokanzo> this is very frustrating
[12:22] <Yokanzo> It looks like its going to work but it doesnt
[12:23] <LjL> __mikem: well, doesn't seem to work here actually :\
[12:23] <mirak> anyone is using lirc ?
[12:23] <LjL> (qalculate is still a fine calculator though)
[12:23] <youser> hey i forced quit my firefox but i cantopen new cuz it says still running, so i go to system monitor but its not there and my process keep changing and disappearring
[12:24] <jrib> Yokanzo: is this still the sudo timestamp too far in the future problem?
[12:25] <youser> anyneknow whats going on?
[12:25] <Yokanzo> jrib no
[12:25] <Yokanzo> I'm trying to update my ubuntu distro version
[12:25] <Yokanzo> from 5.10 to 6.06LTS
[12:25] <jrib> youser: killall firefox-bin
[12:25] <youser> my system monitor used to have a list of processes which constantly stayed there now they disappear and shift likek razy
[12:25] <Yokanzo> and all i get from it is Could not calculate the upgrade
[12:25] <Yokanzo> A unresolvable problem occured while calculating the upgrade. Please report this as a bug.
[12:25] <LjL> __mikem, if there's nothing simpler around, perhaps just try a full-blown algebra system with graphing support like maxima.
[12:26] <youser> anidea why my system monitor isdoing that?
[12:26] <_Genrl_Zo> ok im on desktop
[12:26] <_Genrl_Zo> i did ls
[12:26] <_Genrl_Zo> and i see the flash folder
[12:26] <_Genrl_Zo> now how do i selecte the tar.gz
[12:26] <_Genrl_Zo> ion command line
[12:26] <jrib> !enter | _Genrl_Zo
[12:26] <ubotu> _Genrl_Zo: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[12:26] <_Genrl_Zo> sorry mate] 
[12:27] <jrib> _Genrl_Zo: flash9 beta?
[12:27] <_Genrl_Zo> dont understand jrib right now i did. cd ~/Desktop and after doing ls i see the folder i wanna select.
[12:27] <_Genrl_Zo> Im just doing it to start my venture into understanding linux.
[12:27] <jrib> germfy: are you trying to install flash9 beta?
[12:27] <jrib> i mean _Genrl_Zo
[12:28] <_Genrl_Zo> flash player 7
[12:28] <meeuro1> crimsun http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31328/ that is a log of the terminal if it helps

[12:28] <meeuro1> k
[12:28] <hou5ton> anyone here get Google Earth to work on Edgy?
[12:28] <sizzam> hou5ton: i did
[12:28] <jrib> _Genrl_Zo: you know you can get it through synaptic though?  Have you removed any old version you have?
[12:28] <Yokanzo> So why Can't I upgrade my ubuntu distro to 6.06LTS?
[12:29] <_Genrl_Zo> install_flash_player_7_linux.tar.gz
[12:29] <jrib> !anyone | hou5ton
[12:29] <ubotu> hou5ton: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:29] <Yokanzo> Why does it say "Cannot calculate the upgrade"
[12:29] <__mikem> how do you graph with qalculate
[12:29] <jrib> hou5ton: (yes, I just ran the installer)
[12:29] <bimberi> Yokanzo: how are you doing the upgrade? Update Manager? apt-get command?
[12:29] <Yokanzo> update manager
[12:30] <hou5ton> jrib:   you shouldn't be so quick to judge
[12:30] <Yokanzo> what would be the apt-get version of this?
[12:30] <bimberi> Yokanzo: oh
[12:30] <Yokanzo> becuase clearly the update manager refuses to do anything
[12:31] <jrib> hou5ton: I'm not judging anyone, I'm just explaining that the answer to your question is a bunch of "yes"'s which I don't think is what you want.  If something is wrong, then you should explain what is wrong so someone can help
[12:31] <segosa> has anyone got any suggestions to try if ifconfig shows only "lo", none of my ethernet adapters, but /etc/iftab contains both of them (ethernet & wireless) ?
[12:32] <bimberi> Yokanzo: idk for sure but it would be something like:  remove spurious repos from sources.list, ensure ubuntu-desktop is installed, change breezy to dapper in sources.list, apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:32] <hou5ton> jrib:   ok ... I just didn't know but what it wasn't working on Edgy yet ..... anyway .... I'll work with it some more
[12:32] <segosa> this is a fresh edgy (6.10?) install
[12:32] <jrib> ubotu: tell _Genrl_Zo about flash
[12:33] <svilen> svilen is away for now
[12:33] <LjL> hou5ton, the Google Earth package that's in PLF worked for me, although i'm not sure of the current status of PLF
[12:33] <tehwa> is anyone else having problems with sound playback in edgy? specifically, the sound becoming really slow after opening certain sound apps?
[12:33] <tehwa> slow as in slow-motion
[12:34] <tehwa> I saw a few posts on the forums about it but no solutions, and nothing on launchpad
[12:34] <MarcN> LjL: PLF?   I just downloaded GoogleEarth directly.   Ubuntu now distributing all kinds of closed source packages?
[12:34] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell MarcN about plf
[12:35] <LjL> MarcN: but, yes, ubuntu does distribute a few closed source packages. not google earth though
[12:35] <hou5ton> LjL:   ya .... in limbo ... sort of
[12:36] <linopil> simple q. satred from alter
[12:36] <linopil> nate CD
[12:36] <linopil> which is GNOME
[12:36] <linopil> howto install KDE from that working system ?
[12:37] <jrib> !kde | linopil
[12:37] <ubotu> linopil: KDE (http://kde.org) is the K Desktop Environment. To install from Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop, or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE for other ways to get KDE
[12:37] <LjL> i haven't understood a word you say, but
[12:37] <LjL> !kubuntu
[12:37] <ubotu> Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. For more info see http://kubuntu.org  -  For support: #kubuntu  -  To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop"
[12:37] <linopil> sudo apt-get  install kde?
[12:37] <linopil> nonono
[12:37] <linopil> starting from alternate want to add kde
[12:37] <linopil> LjL: ?
[12:37] <kitche> linopil: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop will add KDE
[12:37] <linopil> OK
[12:38] <LjL> linopil: ?
[12:38] <linopil> got that
[12:38] <linopil> np LjL
[12:38] <linopil> ty kitche
[12:38] <hou5ton> Regarding Google Earth, the docs I used said to leave the installation path as /usr/local/google-earth ... but the default installation path on my install process was in /opt, so I changed it.  Was that a mistake?  Any thoughts?
[12:39] <jrib> hou5ton: doesn't matter
[12:40] <connie_lh> Hello y'all. I just got a new laptop with a widescreen and an nvidia 6100 graphics card. It all works except that my loading screen before gdm is all screwed up. Is there anything I can do?
[12:40] <kitche> linopil: why did you invite me to that channel?
[12:40] <jrib> hou5ton: I usually keep /opt for binary stuff I install and /usr/local for stuff I compile first, but that's just how I prefer to do it
[12:41] <hou5ton> jrib:   makes sense .... I'm doing another install in a different way ....will see if this one works
[12:43] <adam_> the more i use this, the more i love it, edgy made a believer out of me
[12:45] <soundray> connie_lh: if you set "VERBOSE=yes" in /etc/default/rcS , your boot screen will stay in text mode
[12:45] <meeuro1> crimsun any luck? pain in the but isnt it? I got 15 min to get gyachi installed of i have to put windows back on here to run yahoo and that makes me cry lol
[12:45] <connie_lh> soundray: Is there any way to fix the graphic... it's not mission critical but a nice asthetic.
[12:46] <crimsun> meeuro1: I'm still busy, but I'll look in a sec

[12:52] <helloppl> Just download Unbuntu, however when I try and boot from the CDROM it says "Booting from CD..." but then boots from the HDD. I have messed with the BIOS to just simply load from the CDROM, but still no join. It also may be worth mensioning I have burn the ISO file(ps - I extracted the data) onto a DVD
[12:52] <adam_> yanis, can you init?
[12:52] <yanis> adam_: how?
[12:52] <soundray> connie_lh: I have this problem with edgy amd64, but the parallel edgy i386 installation is okay. I'm thinking about filing a bug

[12:54] <soundray> helloppl: it won't work like that. You need to use the iso file as a disk image and create the CD from that. I think you can burn the iso to a DVD instead of a CD.

[12:56] <heatxsink> hello all, I'm having this problem with SSH taking a long time to prompt me for a password, I wonder if it's some kind of weird pam issue?
[12:56] <adam_> try pwd
[12:56] <heatxsink> I'm running ubuntu dapper
[12:56] <shookie> i was trying to get xsane .99 on there
[12:56] <crimsun> meeuro1: libltdl3-dev
[12:56] <adam_> yanis, try pwd
[12:56] <crimsun> meeuro1: you need to do this on your own.
[12:56] <crimsun> meeuro1: apt-cache search something dev
[12:56] <Liquid> you all are using linux OS ?? :)
[12:56] <adam_> Liquid, yes i am
[12:56] <shookie> so i added some depositories and followed a tutorial on the forums
[12:56] <soundray> helloppl: you need a program that can create a disk from an image. I've heard that Nero can do it.
[12:56] <xax> <xax> ciao vorrei configurare jack per poter utilizzare rosegarden .... ma dalle casse non si sente nulla
[12:56] <yanis> adam_: ?
[12:57] <adam_> yanis, try pwd, and put in a new password
[12:57] <TLE> jrib: Hey I read about FHS. It doesn't help that much though. /media/ is for removeable devices and /mnt/ is for something that is mounted temporarely. Soo where is the "right" point to mount extra partition which are mounted all the time ?
[12:57] <adam_> yanis, it should ask you for root pwd
[12:57] <shookie> soundray: so i added some depositories and followed a tutorial on the forums
[12:57] <meeuro1> crimsun i need to install all of the dev files?
[12:57] <helloppl> soundray: Many thanks for that. I presumed it would have the same effect just simply extracting the files. I was going to use Nero first however as I'm running Windows Vista I'm having lots of problems installing it.
[12:57] <highneko> What's a crossover cable? Is it just an ethernet cable?
[12:57] <crimsun> meeuro1: the ones that you need.
[12:58] <jrib> TLE: it's wherever you want really
[12:58] <yanis> adam_: killall kdesktop_lock ;)
[12:58] <adam_> yanis, ?
[12:58] <bimberi> highneko: it's an ethernet cable but wired differently
[12:58] <jrib> TLE: I put them in /media
[12:58] <soundray> helloppl: the iso contains "special" sectors for booting that get displaced by unpacking the iso.
[12:59] <eternalswd> I just upgraded to edgy yesterday.  How do I set -generic kernel to load by default rather than -386?
[12:59] <meeuro1> crimsun wish i was as smart as you lol just curious does sudo apt-file search file name work?
[12:59] <highneko> bimberi: Two computers connected to eachother with it?
[12:59] <Kingsqueak> anyone else still need BitchX fonts installed for ascii?  I made an installer
[12:59] <helloppl> soundray: wasted DVD-R there, oh well. I'll put that down to experiance; however MANY THANKS! :)
[12:59] <soundray> shookie: it looks to me like you've mixed debian repositories with ubuntu ones.
[12:59] <shookie> soundray: I know i figured out that much.. What are my options?
[12:59] <bimberi> highneko: yes
[01:00] <shookie> soundray: i restored my sources.list
[01:00] <adam_> yanis, you still around?
[01:00] <Liquid> jesus only linux linux linux.. ;)
[01:00] <soundray> shookie: what kind of system did you start with? Ubuntu dapper?
[01:00] <highneko> bimberi: I wouldn't have internet when doing this. How would I get files from one computer when doing this?
[01:00] <shookie> soundray: Dapper... and it still is dapper.
[01:00] <TLE> jrib: It would seem so. It doesn't really matter though, It's just because the things that are mounted those two places gets treated differently. e.g. the ones that are mounted in /media/ are shown on the desktop and in the places/machine (Or whatever it is called in english) so I was just wondering if there was a convention
[01:01] <meeuro1> sudo apt-file search jasper why doesnt that work :-\
[01:01] <bimberi> highneko: you set them up with different static IP addresses and transfer that way
[01:01] <bimberi> highneko: for example by running openssh-server on one and using sftp on the other
[01:02] <meeuro1> whats the correct command to search for a file in terminal?
[01:02] <soundray> shookie: check if your directory /var/cache/apt/archives/ still contains a libc6 with "2.3.6-0ubuntu20" in the name. Force install that with dpkg, then try your apt command again.
[01:02] <segosa> locate
[01:02] <jrib> meeuro1: locate, find
[01:02] <yanis> adam_: yes
[01:02] <adam_> yanis, did you get it?
[01:02] <bimberi> meeuro1: locate file   (make sure the locate database is up to date with "sudo updatedb")
[01:02] <yanis> adam_: I solved my problem
[01:02] <Liquid> where i can find help for Ubundu 6.06 LTS Dapper Drake ??
[01:03] <adam_> yanis, what did you do?
[01:03] <jrib> meeuro1: if you really want to search apt-file make sure you have run  sudo apt-file update
[01:03] <tonyyarusso> Liquid: What sort of help?  Here, mailing list, wiki, forums.
[01:03] <Liquid> net hellp
[01:03] <yanis> adam_: I killed the proccesss kdesktop_lock
[01:03] <adam_> yanis, ah...
[01:03] <adam_> yanis, good thinkin...
[01:03] <tonyyarusso> Liquid: Sounds like you're in the right place.  Ask your question and see if anyone has an answer.
[01:04] <tyler_> can I install ubuntu without having to boot to the livecd?  I have a kubuntu system up and running and the drive Iw ant to install kubuntu is blank and waiting to be used :P
[01:04] <adam_> sure you can
[01:04] <shookie> soundray: only thing i see if dev... but libc6 is libc6_2.3.6.ds1-8_i386.deb
[01:04] <adam_> tyler_, yes
[01:04] <tonyyarusso> tyler_: Install the ubuntu-desktop package.
[01:04] <sceo> anyone here that's tried installing edgy from scratch on an e1505?  I can't get ANYthing to work, it was working in dapper...
[01:04] <tonyyarusso> tyler_: Oh, wait.
[01:05] <tonyyarusso> tyler_: You want kubuntu and ubuntu on separate drives?
[01:05] <adam_> sceo, i have a toshiba which has the same video chipset, and basically the same stuff... running like a champ
[01:05] <soundray> shookie: that's the one that wedges your system. Somehow you need to get the ubuntu one back.
[01:05] <Liquid> hmm if anyone hawe a net page for help with a ubundu pls post it :)
[01:05] <sceo> adam_ - not the ATI, right?  you're using the intel 8xx or whater?
[01:05] <sceo> whatever*
[01:05] <shookie> soundray: you know the full filename for it.. so i can search for it?
[01:05] <adam_> sceo, if you want to see if they are the same check out toshiba and compare, i have a A101 S4054
[01:06] <tyler_> tonyyarusso, yes seperate drives, I had to pull the hdd out of my laptop and hook it up to my desktop pc so I could do an install on it then I will put it back in my laptop
[01:06] <adam_> sceo, i have edgy running, and it runs like a top
[01:06] <meeuro1> jrib  sudo apt-file update
[01:06] <meeuro1> sudo: apt-file: command not found

[01:07] <LjL> Liquid: http://help.ubuntu.com/community
[01:07] <jrib> meeuro1: umm were you trying to do the search that crimsun told you to do?
[01:07] <tonyyarusso> tyler_: I think installing from the CD is at least the easiest way - although you could use the alternate CD if you don't want to use the Live environment graphical installer.
[01:07] <sceo> adam_ - what's your native resolution?
[01:07] <adam_> hmm...
[01:07] <Liquid> LjL tnx
[01:07] <adam_> i run widescreen
[01:07] <sceo> 1680x1050?
[01:07] <meeuro1> jrib yes
[01:07] <tonyyarusso> Liquid: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDocumentation
[01:07] <adam_> how do i tell?
[01:08] <jrib> meeuro1: apt-cache search foo
[01:08] <tonyyarusso> LjL: That's the one
[01:08] <adam_> !resolution
[01:08] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[01:08] <Liquid> :)
[01:08] <sceo> adam_ - did you have to do anything special (915resolution patch) -- to check current resolution, go to system -> preferences -> screen resolutions
[01:08] <tyler_> tonyyarusso, I only ask because the cd fails to boot up, it gets to the progress bar for the bootup then when it finishes that the screen goes blank and nothing happens no matter how long I leave it
[01:08] <adam_> no
[01:08] <soundray> shookie: if it's not in your package cache, it's unlikely to be anywhere else. You may have to manually download the proper debs from http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/glibc/
[01:08] <adam_> sceo, ok lemme check, the answer to your question is no tho
[01:08] <sceo> k
[01:08] <shookie> soundray: thanks alot..
[01:08] <LjL> tonyyarusso, well, it gets to the same page =)
[01:08] <tonyyarusso> tyler_: Did you check the CD for integrity?  Probably a bad download or a bad burn.
[01:09] <Liquid> how to find hardware with ubundu os ??
[01:09] <tonyyarusso> LjL: Yeah, but help. is more "official"
[01:09] <soundray> shookie: but my prediction is that you're going to waste a lot of time trying to fix the system, when you could back up your data files and install edgy much quicker.
[01:09] <tyler_> tonyyarusso, yup and it came back with no bad checksums reported
[01:10] <tonyyarusso> tyler_: Maybe your video card and/or monitor don't work with the Live CD, since it's limited in what it can handle.
[01:10] <LjL> tonyyarusso, but loading wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDocumentation *redirects* you to help,ubuntu.com/community
[01:10] <tyler_> boh, does it have a command line installer
[01:10] <shookie> soundray: i was trying to avoid that.. couldn't i just update to edgy?
[01:10] <PhantasyHawk> Can someone tell me why when I try to mount my Windows partition, I get an "Unknown file system" error?
[01:10] <shookie> soundray: and is this the file?  libc6-i686_2.3.6-0ubuntu20_i386.deb
[01:10] <LjL> Liquid: it's "Ubuntu" to start with, and it should find hardware by itself. if it doesn't, check if your hardware is supported
[01:10] <adam_> is there a cmd to see my res? im running kde
[01:10] <tyler_> PhantasyHawk, you have it set wrong in fstab?
[01:10] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Liquid about hardware
[01:11] <shookie> soundray: or libc6_2.3.6-0ubuntu20_i386.deb
[01:11] <tonyyarusso> tyler_: The alternate CD is the text-mode one
[01:11] <tyler_> crap well thanks anyways
[01:12] <jdrake> For some reason I have trouble finding a man page for calloc or malloc, even though glibc-doc is installed. Is there another package I need?
[01:12] <adam_> can someone tell me how to check my res in cmd line?
[01:12] <Kingsqueak> adam_: 'xwininfo' and click the root window
[01:12] <LjL> adam_: xdpyinfo | grep dimen
[01:12] <soundray> shookie: the latter. -- For updating to edgy, I would recommend starting from dapper with ubuntu-desktop and all dependencies cleanly installed
[01:13] <adam_> LjL, thanks
[01:13] <adam_> sceo, hey i am running at 1280 x 800
[01:13] <adam_> sceo, native for my lcd
[01:13] <soundray> shookie: what is the worst loss you expect from a fresh install?
[01:13] <sceo> adam, k thinks
[01:13] <shookie> well i use moblock and its having problems with edgy
[01:13] <tim__b> anyone into tex here?
[01:14] <soundray> tim__b: try
[01:14] <adam_> sceo, want me to link you?
[01:14] <adam_> sceo, to the toshiba page?
[01:14] <PhantasyHawk> Can someone tell me why when i try to mount my fat32 partition I get an unknown file system error?
[01:14] <Liquid> i hawe a D-Link wireless network card but i don't know how to find that hardware and i am a total begginer in linux
[01:14] <sceo> no, it's cool.  i'm just trying to get anything to work over here.  I can't get higher than 1024x768 (but in Dapper I could get native with the 915resolution fix)
[01:15] <tim__b> tryng to include an image via  \includegraphics{/home/tim/workspace/gif.eps}  getting  Undefined control sequence. \includegraphics  while building.
[01:15] <adam_> sceo, edgy worked out of the box...
[01:15] <sceo> similarly, does edgy support dual core out of the box?  I tried installing linux-686-smp, but it didn't show up in my grub menu... and 'top' still shows one processor
[01:15] <sceo> haven't even tried wireless yet..
[01:15] <adam_> sceo, i would guess if dapper does, edgy would too
[01:15] <PhantasyHawk> Can someone tell me why when i try to mount my fat32 partition I get an unknown file system error?
[01:15] <adam_> Idual core
[01:15] <enrique> i have problems printing in gimp with my samsung 1430 laser printer
[01:16] <adam_> !dual core
[01:16] <enrique> any idea?
[01:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dual core - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[01:16] <shookie> soundray: i fixed it
[01:16] <shookie> soundray: you rock!
[01:16] <soundray> tim__b: have you got \usepackage{graphicx} in the preamble?
[01:16] <meeuro1> i installed all of the jasper files listed in apt-cache search but i still get checking for jas_init in -ljasper... no
[01:16] <meeuro1> configure: error: cannot find jasper and/or jpeg library
[01:17] <soundray> shookie: glad it worked.
[01:17] <enrique> does anyone knows how can i resolve printer problem in gimp
[01:17] <rhonda_> oh cool this is working

[01:18] <Enoxs> Hey, for PCI-e support, do i need to upgrade the kernel to 2.6.19 or can i find somewhere a patch?
[01:18] <rhonda_> anyone know what happens to windows programs  after wine installs them and how do you start them
[01:18] <slvr> PhantasyHawk ubuntu does not support fat 32 file system
[01:18] <slvr> ;)
[01:18] <bitchslapper> hey people I have a general question about crypt in unix, what would be a nice place to ask?

What can I do?
[01:19] <enrique> thank liquid
[01:19] <saash> SORI BRO
[01:20] <LjL> rhonda_, the files end up somewhere inside ~/.wine, and you should find icons for them in the main menu.

[01:21] <mzli> slvr, i just send instruction for that. :)
[01:21] <slvr> k
[01:21] <slvr> =] 
[01:21] <soundray> Enoxs: is the bcm4311 device a wireless card?
[01:21] <manchicken> yes
[01:22] <Enoxs> Soundray: Yes it is. After cutting firmware out of a windows driver, the card didn't work. Something with the IRQ handler i guess
[01:22] <meeuro1> i installed all of the jasper files listed in apt-cache search but i still get checking for jas_init in -ljasper... no
[01:23] <meeuro1> is ther some kind of update i need to do for it to recognize the new installs before i ./configure again?
[01:23] <soundray> Enoxs: the problem is unlikely to lie at the PCIe level IMO.
[01:24] <meeuro1> i installed all of the jasper files listed in apt-cache search but i still get checking for jas_init in -ljasper... no
[01:24] <meeuro1> is ther some kind of update i need to do for it to recognize the new installs before i ./configure again?
[01:25] <LjL> meeuro1, no
[01:25] <Liquid> good bye :)!
[01:25] <meeuro1> so any clue :-\
[01:25] <Enoxs> Soundray: I checked the berlios site, somehow there are problems to detect the card properly if it is PCI-e based. They tell about patching the kernel but even then, there are issues with the card.Hope i find a solution.
[01:25] <LjL> i haven't any
[01:25] <rhonda_> i tell you this ubunto is really  amazing  after being  stuck on the  microshaft  os  for so long this is really  a neat change  i sure  hopt  learning this is going to be rewarding and fun
[01:25] <soundray> meeuro1: you need to delete the configure cache. Best is to unpack the archive again.
[01:26] <soundray> Enoxs: I think you might be best off getting a supported USB wifi card.
[01:26] <wheelswitch> is there any easy way to quickly check a systems details, ie ram, cpu etc?

[01:30] <adam_> wheelswitch, im not sure then, i use gui based..
[01:30] <soundray> Enoxs: take it out on Broadcom. They are notoriously bad at supporting free driver development.

[01:41] <dk0r> Getting charged for drivers.
[01:41] <soundray> dk0r: they are free as in free beer, not free as in free speech.

[01:41] <variant> dk0r: what are you talking about?
[01:41] <dk0r> variant: You said the are non-free
[01:41] <variant> dk0r: you can download them free of charge, they are not free software though
[01:41] <prestosd> dk0r: No they arent't!
[01:42] <prestosd> there are free drivers everywhere
[01:42] <wildchild> why I can't get into server as a user (I am still on the server as a root and I created new passwd for user) Could not chdir to home directory home/user/: Permission denied
[01:42] <dk0r> variant: How can you get an app for free, yet it not be free of charge?
[01:42] <soundray> prestosd: there is a difference between "free of charge" and "freely modifiable".
[01:42] <variant> dk0r: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software
[01:42] <LjL> dk0r, "non free" doesn't (always) mean you have to pay for it
[01:42] <prestosd> got your attentjon onw
[01:42] <prestosd> now
[01:42] <dk0r> LjL: strange.
[01:42] <prestosd> can anyone help me with a shutdown splash image problem?
[01:42] <LjL> dk0r, best to read that wikipedia article
[01:43] <soundray> prestosd: don't ask to ask.
[01:43] <prestosd> ???
[01:43] <soundray> prestosd: just describe your problem.
[01:43] <variant> dk0r: the free refers to "freedom" not price, free software can cost money. when people talk of "free and open source software" they are mixing terms
[01:43] <variant> dk0r: open source software doesnt have to be free[dom]  but it _should_ be
[01:44] <prestosd> when I shutdown my pc (ubuntu 6.10) it shuts down fine but then once its done, the shutdown splash is still there, and it wont shut off
[01:44] <dk0r> variant:  Gotcha. Thanks.
[01:44] <variant> dk0r: like, some windows source code is available but you have to sign a non disclosure agreement to see it.. definatly not free
[01:44] <mzli> prestosd, are you using livecd?
[01:44] <prestosd> no
[01:44] <prestosd> i installed off of the livecd though
[01:44] <Toma-> Does anyone use the alberto milone repos for nvidia drivers? i cant get the latest one...
[01:44] <dk0r> variant: Free depends on your definition of cost.
[01:44] <prestosd> if thats what you mean
[01:45] <variant> dk0r: the word free when talking about "free software" has nothing whatsoeverto do with the cost of the software.. it should be called freedom software but that sounds dumb
[01:45] <mzli> prestosd, livecd will act as you described.
[01:45] <prestosd> i know
[01:45] <soundray> variant: he was way too obtuse
[01:45] <prestosd> it does that so you hit enter then reboot
[01:46] <Duane> hi
[01:46] <prestosd> hi
[01:47] <soundray> prestosd: if you select reboot instead of shutdown, does it work or does it stop at the same point
[01:47] <soundray> ?
[01:47] <prestosd> no reboot works
[01:47] <adam_> it shouldnt be free anyways, because you have to give back, so you spend your hard earned time working on it. its not free
[01:47] <Halpo> is there a way to switch what kernel boots up and still runs ubuntu?
[01:47] <MarcN> variant: a better phrase is Libre Software (vs Free)
[01:47] <prestosd> nothing is free dudes
[01:47] <adam_> its free for you to use, but you have to get it working..
[01:47] <prestosd> you either pay or work
[01:47] <adam_> and then, you should give back to the community when you do
[01:48] <adam_> hell marriage aint free, you pay for that too
[01:48] <adam_> hahahaha

[01:51] <baxter_kylie> Hi. How do I share a non-user directory in samba?
[01:51] <prestosd> i said reboot works fine
[01:52] <prestosd> what next?
[01:52] <soundray> prestosd: yes, and after that you chose to make some nihilistic remarks on an offtopic subject. I'm not certain now whether my effort (which btw is FREE to you) is welcome.
[01:52] <derek_> what is a good site for a noobie at linux to go and look at? hopefully it will contain a list of commands

[01:54] <prestosd> i do multi tasking and so do you, what about it?
[01:54] <bimberi> derek_: it's a request to ubotu, the channel bot, to address a factoid to you - which it did
[01:54] <soundray> Thanks Duane
[01:55] <derek_> oh thank you

[01:57] <jimb0> soundray: thanx :)
[01:57] <owh> skreet: Yeah, went back to manually configuring it :-(
[01:58] <prestosd> soundray? what next?
[01:58] <skreet> it justg showed wired right?
[01:58] <Duane> soundray ssh should be active on ubuntu server by default right?
[01:58] <soundray> prestosd: I don't like your attitude. Find someone else to help you out.
[01:58] <bosco> so has edgy been offically released or is it is pre-release
[01:58] <prestosd> I don't think that's the ubuntu attitude
[01:58] <owh> skreet: No, I could create a wireless entry, but I couldn't make WPA-PSK work with it.
[01:58] <kitche> bosco: it's released
[01:58] <soundray> Duane: no, you have to 'sudo apt-get install ssh'
[01:59] <Duane> ok thanks
[01:59] <prestosd> just help the people you like
[01:59] <owh> prestosd: People can choose to help, or not.
[01:59] <Duane> wamp is though correct?

[01:59] <kitche> bosco: no
[01:59] <prestosd> okay, ill be sure to tell everyone what the tec support guys said............
[01:59] <kitche> they will keep sending dapper cds

[01:59] <Tarvok> Hello. Can anyone tell me if there's a way to install programs on an Ubuntu machine that currently has no internet connection, in a manner that will enable it to find updates normally when I finally get the internet working?
[02:00] <kitche> bosco: it's because dapper is still in LTS
[02:00] <owh> Tarvok: Hmm, you should be able to install it, but I suspect you'll need to manually edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file

[02:01] <owh> crimsun: The dig was at a departed person :-)
[02:01] <Pelo> Tarvok, specify the cd /dvd in the repositories and temporaraly disable the updates in the update manager , until you get the internet , then just enable it again
[02:01] <owh> crimsun: I got the distinct impression that said person was expecting free help. The emphasis on "expecting".
[02:02] <owh> Pelo: Doesn't the installer try to find the best repository - mirror - using the Internet connection?
[02:02] <Pelo> owh,  he's got no intenet connection
[02:02] <Tarvok> owh, Pelo: Thank you for the advice. Where do I find the files? I really need to get GNUCash up and running.
[02:03] <owh> Pelo: Which is why I suggested he update the sources.list file manually.

[02:16] <hou5ton> i've tried installing Google Earth a couple times ... in a couple different ways ... the last time just using Synaptic ... now when I open it, it freezes on the initial screen/picture and churns on "initializing" and then locks up the whole system.
[02:16] <mustaqila> Heh
[02:17] <tim167> can I optimize ubuntu? windowmanager etc is very slow here on ibm thinpad G40
[02:17] <Tarvok|Reading> Sorry, bad cut-past. Trying again: Is it possible to know all the needed files if I'm not near the offline machine? If so, once I download the deb files and put them into the specified directory... what then?
[02:17] <hou5ton> I wonder if it's possible that a cheap video card in this eMachine laptop is part of the problem?
[02:17] <xtimx> jrib: Will I be able to find build-essential through SPM as long as I've got universe repositiories?
[02:17] <coz_> Tarvok|Reading, I am not sure what you mean guy sorry I wasn't paying atteion could you fill me in briefly
[02:18] <MarcN> hou5ton: I had that same problem with googleearth.
[02:18] <jrib> xtimx: build-essential is in main
[02:18] <jrib> !build-essential
[02:18] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[02:18] <MarcN> hou5ton: it was working okay on dapper (or maybe just older googleearth kit)
[02:18] <quinnster> Does anyone know if Ubuntu 6.10 uses Xorg or Xfree?
[02:18] <gnat_x> this should be a quick question... does anyone know what the package name for what was msttcorefonts is in the repositories for 6.10?
[02:18] <dk0r> soundray: I installed flashplugin-nonfree via synaptic, doesnt appear to be working firefox2.
[02:18] <soundray> hou5ton: I have this problem with Googleearth once the window size exceeds a certain threshold.
[02:18] <jrib> quinnster: xorg
[02:18] <quinnster> Thanks!
[02:18] <soundray> dk0r: restart firefox perhaps?
[02:18] <dk0r> yes
[02:18] <xtimx> Thanks
[02:18] <dk0r> soundray: Should I restart the machine?
[02:18] <coz_> quinnster, xorg
[02:18] <Tarvok|Reading> I'm trying to figure out if there's a way for me to just download the files necessary to install certain applications and write them to disk, so I can install on a machine that is not yet connected to the internet.
[02:19] <jrib> !info msttcorefonts | gnat_x
[02:19] <ubotu> msttcorefonts: Installer for Microsoft TrueType core fonts. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 22 kB, installed size 164 kB
[02:19] <hou5ton> soundray, MarcN: is it just something that isn't going to work for me, at least for a while?
[02:19] <soundray> dk0r: no, only firefox
[02:19] <Pelo> quinnster,  xorg is in there , donT' know if xfree is there also
[02:19] <dk0r> soundray: So what do I do?
[02:19] <bimberi> gnat_x: still the same - msttcorefonts - in multiverse
[02:19] <Farm_Fresh> Hello.. I'm looking for the correct image to run Ubuntu LiveCD on an Dell Inspiron|E1705 with the Centrino Duo chip.
=== Tarvok|Reading is now known as Tarvok
[02:19] <gnat_x> hrm...
[02:19] <bimberi> Farm_Fresh: Desktop i386
[02:19] <coz_> Tarvok|Reading, well seems simple enough, if you download the deb packages and burn then ti cd or put them on a flash drive , whaever then trasfer them to the offline machine... if I understadn you
[02:19] <soundray> hou5ton: if you have a BIOS option to change the amount of video memory, max it out. Try reducing the googleearth window size.
[02:20] <dario> hello people
[02:20] <Farm_Fresh> bimberi: I tried that before.. No luck.. I just get a black screen.
[02:20] <soundray> hou5ton: 32MB video RAM is the minimum for using it sensibly.
[02:20] <dk0r> I cannot get the flashplugin-nonfree via synaptic to work. But no flash sites (nvidia.com) are working via firefox2. Suggestions?
[02:20] <hou5ton> soundray:   ah ... so it probably is a cheap / lowend video card in this lowend laptop?
[02:20] <Pelo> Farm_Fresh,  I think any of the x86 one will do
[02:21] <bimberi> Farm_Fresh: is there a "safe graphics mode" boot option?  if so, worth a try
[02:21] <soundray> dk0r: see if the plugin loads: enter 'about:plugins' as the URL
[02:21] <dk0r> soundray: None.
[02:21] <soundray> hou5ton: it's possible
[02:21] <Farm_Fresh> Pelo: Someone had suggested the x86-64bit.. But I don't know where to locate that image.
[02:21] <hou5ton> soundray:   ok ... well ... i'll fiddle with it some more ... Thanks
[02:22] <dk0r> soundray: All Types. Enabled: No.
[02:22] <dario> is there anybody who can help a newbie like me?
[02:22] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, go to www.ubuntu.com
[02:22] <Farm_Fresh> Not on Ubuntu.com anyhow.
[02:22] <soundray> Farm_Fresh: there's only amd64. Should work on a Core 2 Duo as well.
[02:22] <Pelo> Farm_Fresh,  I can't realy help
[02:22] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, yes it is
[02:22] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, hold on
[02:22] <Farm_Fresh> soundray I was told that it wasn't true 64bit
[02:22] <gnomefreak> Farm_Fresh: if your gonna use multimedis stuff and nonfree stuff like flash and mp3 and stuff stick with the x86-32
[02:22] <soundray> Farm_Fresh: that's plain wrong.
[02:23] <soundray> gnomefreak: it doesn't boot though
[02:23] <gnomefreak> soundray: what doesnt?
[02:23] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, here you go http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu/edgy/
[02:23] <soundray> Farm_Fresh: have you exhausted your boot options?
[02:23] <soundray> !bootoptions | Farm_Fresh
[02:23] <ubotu> Farm_Fresh: For a list and explanation on some of the boot options, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
[02:23] <Halpo> where do you get man pages from?
[02:23] <Farm_Fresh> coz_ Thanks, but I'm not interested in edgy
[02:23] <bimberi> dario: ask away, if someone can help they'll answer
[02:23] <Pelo> later
[02:23] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, what are ou interested in
[02:23] <jrib> Halpo: they usually get installed along with the programs
[02:24] <dario> thanks
[02:24] <Farm_Fresh> coz_ Dapper.
[02:24] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, hold on
[02:24] <ChocoCid> I have a question regarding fonts that aren't in the repo's- I have 3 fonts on my Windows partition that I want.  How do I install them in Ubuntu (edgy)?
[02:24] <bimberi> Halpo: they come with each package but there is a special set of them in manpages-dev
[02:24] <ChocoCid> (i know how to copy them out etc)
[02:24] <Halpo> jrib: yeah i thought so, but i mean more like system calls...for instance, man exit comes up with nothing for me
[02:24] <jrib> !fonts > ChocoCid
[02:24] <soundray> Halpo: they come with most packages. Some basic ones are in the manpages and manpages-dev packages
[02:24] <jrib> Halpo: manpages-dev
[02:24] <ChocoCid> jrib: thanks
[02:24] <dk0r> I installed flashplugin-nonfree via Synaptic, but firefox 2 isnt seeing it. about:config shows nothing. Suggestions?
[02:24] <Lahey> has anyone seen ailean
[02:25] <jrib> Halpo: well i think that's what you mean
[02:25] <sizzam> dk0r: did you close firefox and reopen it after install?
[02:25] <gnomefreak> dk0r: did you sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[02:25] <Halpo> yeah probably, ill check it out
[02:25] <gnomefreak> dk0r: or are you still trying to build it
[02:25] <bagrdan> hi,is anyone using printer sharing ? I need help!!!
[02:25] <dario> i am trying to install apache and as run ./configure i get the "C compiler can not create executables" error"
[02:25] <dk0r> gnomefreak: no. Didnt do any of that. I downloaded/install it via Synaptic.
[02:25] <gnomefreak> dk0r: hint dont build everything it gets old and tiring after a while
[02:25] <dk0r> sizzam: Yes. Multiple times. The system too
[02:25] <baxter_kylie> Hi. What type of permissions do I need to set on a samba share to make it writable by a remote user?
[02:25] <jrib> dario: apache is in the repositories
[02:25] <eFroyd> hia all
[02:26] <eFroyd> !ntfs
[02:26] <jrib> !lamp > dario
[02:26] <dario> yes
[02:26] <dk0r> gnomefreak: I didn't.
[02:26] <bagrdan> hi,is anyone using printer sharing ? I need help!!!
[02:26] <soundray> dk0r: make sure you have /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[02:26] <gnomefreak> dk0r: from what i saw you grabbed the tar and tried the same as you did for firefox
[02:26] <LjL> !mountwindows | eFroyd
[02:26] <ubotu> eFroyd: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions (the !windowsdrives and !ntfs triggers are temporarily unavailable)
[02:26] <bagrdan> hi,is anyone using printer sharing ? I need help!!!
[02:26] <Farm_Fresh> coz_ I'm only interested in LTS versions..
[02:26] <sizzam> bagrdan: just ask your question
[02:26] <dk0r> gnomefreak: Nope. I got it from Synpatic.
[02:26] <eFroyd> does anyone knows whats the safest way to read/write to ntfs filesystem on linux ?
[02:26] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, here you go http://ftp.wayne.edu/linux_distributions/ubuntu/6.06/
[02:26] <soundray> eFroyd: fuse
[02:26] <soundray> !fuse | eFroyd
[02:26] <ubotu> eFroyd: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[02:27] <eFroyd> !fuse
[02:27] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[02:27] <Farm_Fresh> Whenever they may make 6.01 an LTS then, maybe I'll move on.. Till then dapper is working wonderfully on my box.
[02:27] <sizzam> eFroyd: keywords:  it's still very unsafe
[02:27] <bagrdan> hi,is anyone using printer sharing ? I need help!!!
[02:27] <eFroyd> really sizzam
[02:27] <dk0r> soundray: I don't. Only libunixprintplugin.so
[02:27] <coz_> Farm_Fresh, did you get the linik
[02:27] <coz_> link
[02:27] <Farm_Fresh> Yes, thanks... opening now.
[02:27] <hou5ton> anyone got a crystal ball and know when writing to ntfs is going to be safe?
[02:27] <eFroyd> u know about the linux-ntfs-dev
[02:27] <sizzam> eFroyd: yep, if you're looking for a 'safe' way to do it, linux isn't quite there yet.  if you're willing to assume some risk, then try fuse
[02:28] <soundray> dk0r: exit synaptic and run 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree' in a terminal. Do you get errors?
[02:28] <ChocoCid> so here's my question... i have /usr/share/fonts open
[02:28] <eFroyd> what do u think it could be the worst case scenario ?
[02:28] <ChocoCid> and there are several sub-folders
[02:28] <bagrdan> is anyone using printer sharing ? I need help!!!
[02:28] <ChocoCid> which one should i put something in if i want to use something in Krita?
[02:28] <hou5ton> sizzam:   when you say it isn't yet safe, does it destroy the data, or lock up the machine ... or what/
[02:28] <eFroyd> lost of all files on hd ?
[02:28] <soundray> eFroyd: total filesystem corruption
[02:28] <sizzam> bagrdan: just ask your question
[02:28] <ChocoCid> i see afms, truetype, type1, X11
[02:28] <eFroyd> uhhh
[02:28] <eFroyd> thats bad
[02:28] <ChocoCid> (and a couple fonts in the folder itself)
[02:28] <sizzam> hou5ton: not sure
[02:29] <soundray> eFroyd: in other words: backup before you experiment
[02:29] <eFroyd> u know, i have an HD 250 gigs that i would like to save all my files, either from linux or win , any suggestion then ?
[02:29] <coz_> ChocoCid, true type should be recognized but not sure for krita
[02:29] <ChocoCid> eFroyd: make a separate partition as FAT32
[02:29] <bagrdan> I need to see if the port 139 is open when you use printer sharing!
[02:29] <ChocoCid> both linux and windows can read them safely
[02:29] <bimberi> bagrdan: sudo netstat -plunt
[02:29] <eFroyd> yah the thing is i already have sensitive 200 gigs in use in this partition
[02:29] <bagrdan> thx
[02:29] <dario> i am trying to install apache and as i run ./configure i get the "C compiler can not create executables" error, what the problem can be?
[02:29] <soundray> eFroyd: better yet, make it ext3 and install a Windows driver for the second extended filesystem
[02:29] <eFroyd> so i cant really backup the data and make it fat yah know
[02:29] <ChocoCid> eFroyd: yow
[02:30] <jrib> dario: did you see what I said before?
[02:30] <sizzam> dario:  apache is available in the repos via apt-get
[02:30] <mustaqila> Okay, I've disabled ipv6 and I've some weird networking issues afoot
[02:30] <eFroyd> make it ext3 ?
[02:30] <mustaqila> I've no longer got "eth0: No ipv6 routers present", but the problem persists
[02:30] <ChocoCid> yeah windows has a way to read ext3
[02:30] <mustaqila> I can connect to my LAN, but not the internet
[02:30] <soundray> eFroyd: doesn't apply if you already have data on it
[02:30] <binarydigit> anyone know how to make gmplayer always on top?
[02:30] <skreet> EXT_IFS www.fs-driver.org
[02:30] <Farm_Fresh> Geeze I can't stand this IRC client, mIRC... I wish my gf would just let me partition and stick ubuntu on here.
[02:30] <mustaqila> pinging works, dns resolving works, but opening a webpage doesn't
[02:30] <dario> i cannot get it via apt-get
[02:31] <jrib> binarydigit: right click on the title bar, "always on top"
[02:31] <eFroyd> but how am i gonna "transform" my hd with all my files in it to ext3
[02:31] <eFroyd> right hey soundray
[02:31] <skreet> Farm_Fresh: ssh and use bitchX?
[02:31] <binarydigit> ah , i was right cliking everywhere ese
[02:31] <binarydigit> thanks
[02:31] <dario> like apt-get install apache???
[02:31] <eFroyd> so i just cant do it
[02:31] <eFroyd> :(
[02:31] <rlared> hey all, does anyone know what's up with there not being k7 or 686 kernels anymore?
[02:31] <jrib> dario: 'apache2' is in main
[02:31] <Farm_Fresh> skreet: that is beyond my knowledge.
[02:31] <Vorbote> Farm_Fresh: uwin and irssi...
[02:31] <bimberi> rlared: replace by -generic
[02:32] <Farm_Fresh> Vorbote: I have used irssi.. I like that.
[02:32] <coz_> rlared, I believe they are still in the repos but let me check
[02:32] <bimberi> rlared: *replaced
[02:32] <Farm_Fresh> Vorbote: Is that an option on XP?
[02:32] <ChocoCid> i would like irssi a lot more if it had its own window and didn't stick in the terminal
[02:32] <dario> i can't believe it
[02:32] <ChocoCid> that said xchat > that anyway :P
[02:32] <eFroyd> i read about some projects that says something like "the safest way to read write in ntfs's" but yall think in general its still unsafe right ?
[02:32] <Vorbote> Farm_Fresh: You still need to compile it, but uwin is an excellent POSIX emulator (far better than Cygwin).
[02:32] <dario> thanks a lot
[02:32] <dario> :)
[02:32] <ChocoCid> eFroyd: there is no "safe" way to write in ntfs
[02:32] <eFroyd> i mean i have a friend that keep telling me its safe but i TRULLY believe in this channel
[02:32] <rlared> bimberi: isn't generic i386?
[02:32] <ChocoCid> reading is basically safe though
[02:33] <eFroyd> i hate that evil corporation
[02:33] <ChocoCid> so that may do the job
[02:33] <ChocoCid> heh
[02:33] <Farm_Fresh> Vorbote: I've never compiled anything, or even know how to do it.
[02:33] <eFroyd> they want everybody stuck on linux
[02:33] <bimberi> rlared: yes, that too
[02:33] <ChocoCid> uh...
[02:33] <eFroyd> i mean
[02:33] <eFroyd> on windows
[02:33] <ChocoCid> XD
[02:33] <eFroyd> :D
[02:33] <rlared> so we have to compile our own kernel if we want it optimized
[02:33] <LjL> rlared: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[02:33] <eFroyd> ubuntu is a great way to become a linuxuser
[02:33] <soundray> eFroyd: I don't think you're running a major risk, unless you are using unusual NTFS features.
[02:33] <Vorbote> Farm_Fresh: There is a first time for everything. Nobody is born knowing it all (although some graduates I've taught would seem so...).
[02:33] <eFroyd> im loving it so far
[02:34] <ChocoCid> well
[02:34] <eFroyd> what u mean unusual ntfs features soundray ?
[02:34] <ChocoCid> ntfs read/write worked well out of the box for me in edgy
[02:34] <ChocoCid> that said i had issues with it in dapper (it just flat-out wouldn't work)
[02:34] <eFroyd> in in the dapper
[02:34] <eFroyd> im using the dapper
[02:34] <ChocoCid> my problem was i couldn't get it to mount
[02:34] <ChocoCid> so... probably irrelevant to your case
[02:34] <Farm_Fresh> Vorbote:  could you point me to a link with a walk through on how to do it?  I read about it everywhere... Guess that would be my next step in Linux.
[02:34] <eFroyd> well i mouted and i can read everything
[02:35] <bimberi> LjL: tyvm for that link!
[02:35] <ChocoCid> but if you've got highly important mission-critical stuff it seems that the "risk" associated with NTFS may not be worth it
[02:35] <eFroyd> and i also got a software for windows where i can copy the linux files to win
[02:35] <eFroyd> but i dont like working around things
[02:35] <ChocoCid> i've had no issues other than XP wanting to do chkdsk every single time i reboot it
[02:35] <rlared> LjL: ah very interesting. . .
[02:35] <coz_> rlared, I belive the generic has obsolieted the m
[02:35] <eFroyd> i like them the way they should be
[02:35] <ChocoCid> and well
[02:35] <ChocoCid> every time i try to run ntfsfix...
[02:35] <ChocoCid> lappy@lappy:~$ ntfsfix hda1
[02:35] <ChocoCid> Failed to determine whether hda1 is mounted: No such file or directory
[02:35] <ChocoCid> Mounting volume... FAILED
[02:35] <ChocoCid> Attempting to correct errors... FAILED
[02:35] <ChocoCid> Failed to startup volume: No such file or directory
[02:35] <ChocoCid> Volume is corrupt. You should run chkdsk.
[02:35] <rlared> ya. . . but i notice that i'm using stuff like ide_generic, i wonder if i compile modules for my specific hardware if that will run faster
[02:35] <whatthedeuce> Hey.  Is there any reason configure would not be able to detect HAL?  I have hal 0.5.7 installed, yet when I run ./configure, I get this error: "checking for HAL... configure: error: Package requirements (hal >= 0.5.0) were not met"
[02:35] <jrib> !paste | ChocoCid
[02:35] <ubotu> ChocoCid: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:36] <Vorbote> Farm_Fresh: give yourself a stroll through http://tldp.org You'll find lots of useful information there.
[02:36] <eFroyd> oh
[02:36] <ChocoCid> (it works, but i still get the corrupt message)
[02:36] <eFroyd> thats uglhy
[02:36] <ChocoCid> so i don't think i'd trust it for mission-critical stuff
[02:36] <soundray> eFroyd: NTFS has some features that are poorly documented (if at all). If the innocent FUSE driver encounters those, the results can be unpredictable.
[02:36] <Farm_Fresh> To compile something is just finding all the correct files and putting them in the right place?
[02:36] <eFroyd> i c
[02:36] <Halpo> whats the difference between gzip and bz2
[02:36] <ChocoCid> no, Farm_Fresh: compiling is to take something that's source code and make it into a binary
[02:36] <fmasi> how can i get the latest vertion of clamAV in my rep i use edgy
[02:36] <eFroyd> on the ntfs hard drive i use features such as especific permitions to certain files
[02:36] <LjL> Halpo: they're two different compression formats (and algorithms)
[02:36] <eFroyd> and certain directories
[02:36] <ChocoCid> fmasi: sudo apt-get update
[02:37] <Farm_Fresh> ChocoCid: Oh, geeze.. I was hoping it would sound a bit easier than that.
[02:37] <eFroyd> so i might not take the risc
[02:37] <ChocoCid> then sudo apt-get upgrade
[02:37] <eFroyd> guys
[02:37] <eFroyd> thanx for everything
[02:37] <eFroyd> :D
[02:37] <Halpo> LjL: i know that, just curious what the preference would be
[02:37] <eFroyd> i hope i can become one of u guys that have answers for everything one day here
[02:37] <eFroyd> :D
[02:37] <fmasi> but curently its the vertion 0.88.4 and the latest stable one is 0.88.6
[02:37] <eFroyd> cya a a good nightt
[02:37] <ChocoCid> Farm_Fresh: if you want, write a simple script in C then run it through GCC's compiler to "get it"
[02:37] <mustaqila> I've got a machine here with Ubuntu Dapper on it. It appears to be able to communicate with the internet all fine and well provided that it's not port 80. So to cut a long story short, my Linux box can't use Port 80 for some odd reason. Anyone have any ideas why?
[02:37] <ChocoCid> (or use python's compiler)
[02:37] <LjL> Halpo: bzip2 compresses better on average. it's also slower to compress, and still kind of slower decompressing
[02:37] <cornell> This is not exactly ubuntu, but I've not been able to find an answer anywhere.  How can I get a list of usernames/userids?
[02:37] <ChocoCid> cornell: the "who" command?
[02:38] <soundray> Halpo: gzip for speed, bzip2 for filesize (especially with natural language texts)
[02:38] <ChocoCid> i think "who" will give you what you want
[02:38] <fmasi> ChocoCid, is tehr any extra repository to have the 0.88.6
[02:38] <RegalEagle> How do I enable higher screen resolutions without reinstalling Ubuntu?
[02:38] <Farm_Fresh> ChocoCid:  I don't know anything about any type of programing..
[02:38] <Vorbote> Farm_Fresh: to exapand on what uwin is, it is a POXIX runtime created a ATT/Lucent to allow using Unix applications under Windows. You install uwin and get a basic Unix subsystem under windows. You can compile irssi and run it under the usin emulation.
[02:38] <ChocoCid> Farm_Fresh: then you don't really need to know or care about what "compile" means
[02:38] <cornell> ChocoCid: that's only those logged on.
[02:38] <ChocoCid> ah
[02:38] <rlared> anyone know if compiling hardware specific modules will give me a speed increase vs generic modules?
[02:38] <soundray> cornell: 'cat /etc/passwd'
[02:38] <RegalEagle> How do I enable higher screen resolutions without reinstalling Ubuntu?

[02:39] <ChocoCid> cool
[02:39] <Farm_Fresh> Vorbote:  Oh.. hehe.. Well that sounds like it would take me the better part of a month to even figure out how to make that happen, let alone do it correctly.
[02:39] <LjL> !msg the bot
[02:39] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[02:39] <ChocoCid> i need that for a system that's stuck on too high a resolution
[02:39] <Vich> RegalEagle edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:39] <soundray> rlared: if they exist at all, they won't be noticable
[02:39] <bimberi> LjL: fyi I've set up !generic :)
[02:39] <Vich> I had to edit my config to get widescreen aspect ratio
[02:40] <rlared> soundray: ok thanks, i didn't really think it would matter
[02:40] <ChocoCid> heh
[02:40] <ChocoCid> mine worked out of the box on dapper and edgy
[02:40] <LjL> bimberi, good, will be handy
[02:40] <CPrgmSwR2> how do you install kde on ubuntu
[02:40] <ChocoCid> my parents' computer had issues with video resolution
[02:40] <ChocoCid> CPrgmSwR2: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[02:40] <CPrgmSwR2> ah okay
[02:40] <cornell> soundray: Great, that looks like it.  Now I just have to figure out what's in it :-)
[02:40] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell CPrgmSwR2 about kde
[02:40] <highneko> CPrgmSwR2: wait
[02:40] <prestosd> I used to be able to play 3d games in linux (ubuntu 6.10) but after doing a clean install of 6.10 (i used to have 6.06lts) i am no longer able to play 3d games (neverball, enemylines3 etc.) any ideas?
[02:40] <CPrgmSwR2> okay
[02:40] <elTigre> I want to  upgrade to edgy, and I get "can't find gtkDistupgradesomething"
[02:40] <highneko> CPrgmSwR2: You could also do "apt-get install kde-core"
[02:41] <ChocoCid> intriguing. what's the difference?
[02:41] <elTigre> google tells me  I have to install python-vte
[02:41] <CPrgmSwR2> I am currently running gentoo so I don'
[02:41] <soundray> cornell: man 5 passwd
[02:41] <elTigre> but it's already the latest version
[02:41] <highneko> ChocoCid: I don't know. I use "kde-core"
[02:41] <CPrgmSwR2> but I am investigating it for a freind
[02:41] <ChocoCid> i've always been told kubuntu-desktop, how odd
[02:41] <CPrgmSwR2> because he had an issue with his pc and for some reason he wants to try linux
[02:41] <ChocoCid> "for some reason"?
[02:41] <ChocoCid> looks like having windows problems IS his reason :p
[02:41] <Farm_Fresh> Well heck, I guess I'll just let this download finish and hope the LiveCD will work..  I might be back tomorrow to figure out what is up if any problems arise.
[02:41] <Farm_Fresh> Good night all.
[02:42] <cornell> soundray: Double Cool!  Thanks much!!
[02:42] <CPrgmSwR2> Actually he ran out of disk space and can't boot up windows
[02:42] <ChocoCid> ...rofl
[02:42] <ChocoCid> :(
[02:42] <Maintech> What is the best program to use to print multiple pictures on one photo paper?
[02:42] <ChocoCid> Maintech: you need to resize them or not?
[02:42] <soundray> Maintech: oodraw
[02:42] <Maintech> ChocoCid, prolly
[02:42] <ChocoCid> oodraw or krita most likely
[02:42] <ChocoCid> whichever you prefer
[02:42] <ChocoCid> (the more i use krita the more i love it heh)
[02:43] <CPrgmSwR2> I plan to use a live cd to recover his files and install linux
[02:43] <ChocoCid> good call :)
[02:43] <CPrgmSwR2> can linux pretty well read ntfs files?
[02:43] <ChocoCid> yes
[02:43] <Maintech> These work well for family pictures?
[02:43] <ChocoCid> reads fine
[02:43] <CPrgmSwR2> just can't write fine
[02:43] <ChocoCid> writes fine to a non-NTFS partition :P
[02:43] <ChocoCid> Maintech: the content of the picture has no effect on what program you'd use to edit them...
[02:43] <CPrgmSwR2> okay so I could make a fat32 partition
[02:43] <CPrgmSwR2> copy over files
[02:43] <CPrgmSwR2> and convert it to ntfs
[02:43] <Maintech> Thanks a bunch guys..
[02:43] <ChocoCid> why would you do that?
[02:44] <CPrgmSwR2> to recover files
[02:44] <sethk> Maintech, I use gimp for all sorts of fairly complex photography stuff.  I do move the resulting jpeg files to a windows box for printing, though.
[02:44] <ChocoCid> if you're installing linux, just make a folder in /~/username for his old files
[02:44] <bluefox83> ok..my damn art manager keeps crashing when i try to download or install new themes for my splash screen..whats going on? (in edgy)
[02:44] <JasonMog8D> how do i ctrl+z without stopping the job
[02:44] <ChocoCid> like /~/joe/oldfiles
[02:44] <CPrgmSwR2> okay
[02:44] <ChocoCid> save them to a disk or something
[02:44] <CPrgmSwR2> he doesn't have a cd-burner
[02:44] <ChocoCid> e-mail them to yourself then
[02:44] <mohadib> can anyone suggest an app for recording my desktop?
[02:44] <ChocoCid> mohadib: like... printscreen?
[02:44] <LjL> !info istanbul | mohadib
[02:45] <CPrgmSwR2> oh yeah e-mail myself 10 GB
[02:45] <ubotu> istanbul: Desktop session recorder. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 47 kB, installed size 380 kB
[02:45] <ChocoCid> ugh, 10 gigs?
[02:45] <CPrgmSwR2> yeah he has lots of videos
[02:45] <mohadib> LjL: istanbul seems buggy
[02:45] <ChocoCid> yeah, make a partition
[02:45] <mohadib> was hopping for something else
[02:45] <CPrgmSwR2> and songs
[02:45] <Lam_> lol there should be a way to have whatever you hightlight go into the clipboard; i keep forgetting that by highlighting something, it doesn't copy it so i can't use ctrl+v
[02:45] <ChocoCid> clear off all the junk from his hd now, make a fat32 partition, wipe the remainder of the ntfs partition, and install ext3 there
[02:45] <ChocoCid> Lam_: middleclick!
[02:45] <ChocoCid> :D
[02:46] <Lam_> ChocoCid: lol yeah. i keep forgetting that middleclick != paste

[02:46] <RegalEagle> How do I edit a read-only file?
[02:46] <CPrgmSwR2> I forget does ubuntu have a livecd verions
[02:46] <ChocoCid> sudo edit it
[02:46] <ademan> nautilus feels really unstable since my upgrade to edgy, i meant killall nautilus fixes it, but that shouldnt happen, has anyone else been experiencing similar instability?
[02:46] <ChocoCid> yes, CPrgmSwR2
[02:46] <CPrgmSwR2> okay cool
[02:46] <RegalEagle> How do I edit a read-only file?
[02:46] <sizzam> ademan: nautilus has been fine for me so far (knock on wood)
[02:46] <ChocoCid> RegalEagle: sudo gedit filename
[02:46] <RegalEagle> Edit and save, that is
[02:46] <RegalEagle> k
[02:46] <ChocoCid> (or whatever)
[02:47] <ChocoCid> sudo should do it though
[02:47] <CPrgmSwR2> chmod o=rw file RegalEagle
[02:47] <ChocoCid> or you could sudo and change the permissions
[02:47] <CPrgmSwR2> oops
[02:47] <ChocoCid> but you probably don't want to do that
[02:47] <CPrgmSwR2> I mean chmod u=rw [file name] 
[02:47] <ChocoCid> (depending on the file)
[02:47] <bluefox83> ademan, been stable for me..but things like firefox and art manager are pretty flimsy...
[02:47] <ademan> firefox has been pretty bad for me too
[02:47] <ChocoCid> firefox is fine for me :|
[02:48] <ademan> haven't installed the art manager, since all i need is bluecurve :-)
[02:48] <ChocoCid> but then again i use swiftfox

[02:48] <hazza> Anyone use kflickr?
[02:48] <soundray> ademan: create a new user and see if nautilus and firefox are unstable when you use them as the new user.
[02:49] <CPrgmSwR2> can you install ubuntu without a boot loader?
[02:49] <lwizardl> hi
[02:49] <CPrgmSwR2> because I already have one with gentoo
[02:49] <ademan> bimberi: i've got flash block, so it doesnt even load flash movies till i allow them.  Additionally i haven't noticed any correspondence between flash and firefox crashing
[02:49] <ChocoCid> uh
[02:49] <ademan> soundray: this is actually a fresh install
[02:49] <bimberi> ademan: k
[02:49] <ChocoCid> ubuntu goes on a separate partition
[02:49] <Sourcemage> Could anyone tell me what "RC" means in distribution releases?
[02:49] <morten_> currently, the characters ,  and  don't show up in filenames on my ubuntu box. what package do i need, or what do i need to edit, in order to display 'foreign' characters?
[02:49] <soundray> CPrgmSwR2: yes, but you have to use the alternate CD
[02:49] <prestosd> All of my 3d games in Ubuntu 6.10 crash when I try to start them.
[02:49] <CPrgmSwR2> Sourcemage do you use sourcemage distro
[02:49] <ChocoCid> so i would think it would make its own grub
[02:49] <ChocoCid> not sure though
[02:49] <JasonMog8D> Sourcemage release candidate
[02:49] <prestosd> Any ideas?
[02:49] <bimberi> Sourcemage: Release Candidate
[02:49] <CPrgmSwR2> Release Canidate
[02:49] <ademan> Sourcemage: its release candidate
[02:49] <lwizardl> how do I specify which IPs can ssh into a ubuntu server?
[02:49] <ademan> wow i'm slow
[02:49] <ChocoCid> release candidate
[02:49] <JasonMog8D> i win
[02:49] <ademan> lol
[02:49] <ChocoCid> heh
[02:49] <morten_> prestosd: x driver that supports 3d would be a good start
[02:50] <prestosd> I have it

[02:51] <dubyahite> hey does anyone know why when i upgraded to edgy my firefox stopped working properly, it just closes for no reason now
[02:51] <morten_> prestosd: did you check the list of cards which should be using legacy?
[02:51] <prestosd> no
[02:51] <prestosd> what list?
[02:51] <elTigre> I find some advice to install python-vte, but it is already installed
[02:51] <CPrgmSwR2> Because I don't want it to mess up my gentoo install
[02:51] <ChocoCid> heh
[02:51] <morten_> prestosd: there's not that many cards which require the legacy package. there's a list of those.
[02:51] <ChocoCid> ubuntu won't stop gentoo from booting

[02:54] <ChocoCid> change your terminal font!
[02:54] <morten_> right.

[02:56] <ChocoCid> i think he already rebooted, but w/e
[02:56] <ChocoCid> doesn't matter much
[02:56] <sizzam> RegalEagle: oops, sorry

[02:57] <soundray> zach634: pastebin the output of 'ls -l' as well
[02:57] <prestosd> morten_: yes, my card is on the list

[02:58] <zach634> soundray: allright, i used chmod 777 on it
[02:58] <morten_> ChocoCid: i think this goes beyond just a font issue. mpd won't load songs with special chracters in them. i think it's a systemwide thing.
[02:58] <RegalEagle> I changed all resolutions in /etc/x-11/xorg.conf to "1600x1200 1280x1024 1024x768"

[03:01] <dudesmithy> prestosd : did you have to do anything special?  I can see it change the volume on the screen but the volume doesn't actually change...
[03:02] <mcphail> zach634: try typing "hash -r"
[03:02] <prestosd> dudesmithy: No, i didnt do anything special. I see it change on the screen too. But it must actaully be changing, because it changes in the toolbar too
[03:02] <prestosd> (upper right)
[03:03] <dudesmithy> prestosd : Alright...I'm stumped...
[03:03] <prestosd> dudesmithy: Are you getting any volume at all>?
[03:03] <prestosd> or none?
[03:03] <zach634> mcphail: allright, but it didnt seem to do anything.  What would hash do?
[03:03] <dudesmithy> prestosd yea....I can change the volume at the speakers...just not with the keyboard...
[03:03] <soundray> zach634: what does 'sh hldsupdatetool.bin' give you?
[03:04] <zach634> "cannot execute binary file"
[03:04] <prestosd> dudesmithy and you can hear stuff?
[03:04] <mcphail> zach634: just in case bash is getting confused with previously tried PATHs

[03:05] <prestosd> does your toolbar volume change when you use the keyboard buttons??
[03:05] <dudesmithy> prestosd : I've tried add a xmodmap.conf and running in post log in (as I've seen some posts about) but it doesn't seem to help.
[03:05] <prestosd> i dont know anything about that! :)
[03:05] <dudesmithy> prestosd : no....They don't seem to be linked.
[03:05] <prestosd> hmmmm
[03:05] <prestosd> !volume
[03:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about volume - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:06] <prestosd> lol, just testing
[03:06] <soundray> lwizardl: if your machine is connected to the internet, and no firewall restricts access, all IPs can ssh into your machine.
[03:06] <prestosd> dudesmithy: have you googled it?

[03:07] <ChocoCid> well
[03:07] <prestosd> dudesmithy: well, im actually not a official ubuntu support dude or anything, so I would say, try again later, post on the forums, search wikipedia, and ask more people on this IRC

[03:12] <bullium> has n e 1 gotten easyubuntu installed and working with 6.10
[03:12] <soundray> zach634: remove ubuntu-desktop, then you can remove all unneeded apps individually.
[03:12] <zach634> or something
[03:12] <pcgigabyte012> Hey has anyone here ever got gyach working in ubuntu?

[03:17] <bullium> TLE: ok thanks, I'll just wait and watch their site for updates
[03:17] <OmniColos> bullium, vader, what packages did you need ot install?
[03:17] <soundray> bullium: I've used the svn version with some success on a fresh edgy install.
[03:17] <Phuzion> I like how the kick message is "user has left, requested by so and so"
[03:18] <vader> I need the ATI stuff. I tried to use the wiki but it lost my X OmniColos
[03:18] <ChocoCid> that's because it's not a real kick
[03:18] <OmniColos> ah
[03:18] <Phuzion> SAPART?
[03:18] <OmniColos> are you on a mac vader
[03:18] <zach634> "User has been politely asked to leave and never come back."
[03:18] <prestosd> anyone know how to import sound themes into the sound preferences?
[03:18] <bullium> OmniColos: I just read that easyubuntu was the easiest way to get all the codecs and stuff working with minimal work
[03:18] <prestosd> like tar.gz files
[03:19] <vader> OmniColos, nope a laptop with an AMD processor
[03:19] <bullium> soundray: so the svn version worked huh?
[03:19] <ChocoCid> !restrictedformats > bullium
[03:19] <ChocoCid> works well
[03:19] <kitche> prestosd:; think you have to un tar it
[03:19] <prestosd> kitche: drat
[03:19] <OmniColos> bullium, codecs are pretty easy now... if you enable multiverse and universe and search for gstreamer bad and ugly
[03:19] <prestosd> !language | me
[03:19] <ubotu> me: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[03:20] <soundray> bullium: except for some packages that aren't in the repositories yet (Java and Skype) didn't work for me).
[03:20] <ChocoCid> so linux lets me ssh into my own system
[03:20] <ChocoCid> lol
[03:20] <zach634> yep
[03:20] <ChocoCid> not bad, at least it lets me test that ssh is working!
[03:20] <ChocoCid> not bad, i can fix my parents' computer remotely with this
[03:21] <zach634> parents using 'nix?
[03:21] <OmniColos> vader, I had a rough time with ati+emac
[03:21] <ChocoCid> yes
[03:21] <zach634> nice
[03:21] <OmniColos> but its all straight now
[03:21] <ChocoCid> windows ME kept getting infected
[03:21] <zach634> aoghg!@
[03:21] <bullium> OmniColos: I'm doing as you suggested right now
[03:22] <funkyHat> ChocoCid, you can even run X programs over SSH, so you can ssh in to a remote SSH server, run something like seamonkey/gnome-system-monitor or whatever, and the window will appear on your screen
[03:22] <ChocoCid> yeah
[03:22] <mcphail> ChocoCid: remember to edit sshd_config to make the setup as secure as possible
[03:22] <[BTF] Chm0d> hey guys i am trying to install vmware workstation on edgy and i am getting this error can anyone shed any light as to what I am missing??  http://pastebin.ca/247152
[03:22] <zach634> i learned most of my nix skills on the macs at school
[03:22] <bobbby> Hi there, i have problem with my Asus-m2n on edgy
[03:22] <zach634> ssh-wise
[03:22] <soundray> zach634: was the hlsdupdate program compiled for a different architecture than yours?
[03:22] <CPrgmSwR2> is there any movie files that linux cannot read?
[03:23] <bobbby> does anyone know hot to install the network drivers, audio drivers as well
[03:23] <ChocoCid> DRM'ed shit
[03:23] <ChocoCid> (yes, i know, language)
[03:23] <zach634> soundray: i don't think so...  it had run fine under ubuntu-64-desktop
[03:23] <ChocoCid> (it deserves it :( )
[03:23] <bullium> OmniColos: installing right now
[03:23] <CPrgmSwR2> DRM is a pain in the ass
[03:23] <ChocoCid> yeah... don't really know what to do with ssh_config :(
[03:23] <CPrgmSwR2> especially if you have an ati card
[03:23] <OmniColos> bullium, also take a look at this repository http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/dists/edgy/3v1n0/
[03:24] <mcphail> ChocoCid: man 5 sshd_config :)
[03:24] <OmniColos> there are lots of neat things like flash9
[03:24] <CPrgmSwR2> once you install ubuntu do you have to redownload to continue to have it upgraded or does it remain updated
[03:24] <ChocoCid> it automatically alerts you for updates
[03:24] <ChocoCid> you don't have to reinstall
[03:24] <CPrgmSwR2> awsome
[03:24] <ChocoCid> you use gentoo, right?
[03:25] <CPrgmSwR2> yeah
[03:25] <soundray> zach634: still, you might want to try 'sudo apt-get install linux32 ; linux32 hlsupdatetool.bin'
[03:25] <ChocoCid> apt is the equivalent of portage
[03:25] <CPrgmSwR2> ah okay
[03:25] <CPrgmSwR2> but except apt is binary based an portage is source based?
[03:25] <funkyHat> You'll miss portage though, aptitude isn't quite as advanced (It's still better than RPM though :-))
[03:25] <ChocoCid> i think so , yeah
[03:25] <ChocoCid> apt has some sources but mostly binaries
[03:25] <air0day> anyone have time to explain to a n00b how to get more resolution options in system->preferences->screen resolution?

[03:27] <OmniColos> air0day, that was a forum link to the xorg gui
[03:27] <vader> Sierra, right click and unmount

[03:28] <MarcN>  Sierra: sudo umount /media/WHATEVER
[03:28] <CPrgmSwR2> you have to wait a week before the ebuild is fixed
[03:28] <soundray> zach634: one more idea: 'strace ./hlsupdatetool.bin'... any clues from that?
[03:28] <CPrgmSwR2> and some packages need updating
[03:28] <CPrgmSwR2> but it seems to still be working pretty well
[03:28] <OmniColos> is anyone playing scourge here?
[03:28] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, that's if you're running ~arch though yeah? People running stable won't have problems with new packages

[03:34] <ChocoCid> there isn't one until you do sudo passwd ______
[03:34] <zach634> soundray: i think it's dapper, but i tried it with edgy before and got the same answer
[03:34] <CPrgmSwR2> I see
[03:34] <Rug> Howdy all, my numberpad is no longer working.  any suggestions?
[03:34] <MaHaGoN> Halai, have you tried going into you /etc/X11/xorg.conf and fixing it there?
[03:34] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, ya, sudo will prompt you for your own password, it's nice for regular PC users as they don't have to remember 2 passwords (or remember to change them both at the same time)
[03:34] <CPrgmSwR2> thats ubuntus way of making it more idiot proof?
[03:35] <ChocoCid> yes
[03:35] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, pretty much :)
[03:35] <zach634> Rug: i dont have to say "numlock" right?
[03:35] <ChocoCid> it stops you from having a root account by default
[03:35] <Rug> zach634: hehe no
[03:35] <zach634> k
[03:35] <MaHaGoN> those should be defined somewhere in your conf file, and you probably just need to copy paste copy paste
[03:35] <Halai> MaHaGoN: I'm not very good with editing conf files, a how-to would be significantly appreciated. to answer your question, i did go in, didn't find anything wrong with it.
[03:35] <Sierra> woot
[03:35] <LjL> zach634, i don't know if there's anything specific to the 64-bit version, but in general you can insert the cd and then type "sudo apt-cdrom add", in order for apt-get to look for packages into the CD first
[03:35] <Sierra> MarcN, i figured it out ;p james@kami:~$ sudo eject /dev/sda2
[03:35] <Sierra> Password:
[03:35] <Sierra> james@kami:~$
[03:35] <Sierra> it worked!
[03:35] <bobbby> hey anyone using ASUs motherboards on edgy?
[03:35] <Sierra> ;p
[03:35] <CPrgmSwR2> I guess I would get use to it after a while
[03:35] <bullium> OmniColos: that fixed it, how did you know to do that?
[03:36] <zach634> LjL: thanks!
[03:36] <Rug> ack
[03:36] <bobbby> ASUS*, i mean
[03:36] <OmniColos> bullium, I have done the same my friend
[03:36] <CPrgmSwR2> 50% on the download of the alternative cd
[03:36] <zach634> on an unrelated note, does anyone know how late burger king is open?
[03:36] <soundray> Thanks LjL
[03:36] <OmniColos> bobbby, I have edgy on asus p4p800
[03:36] <bullium> OmniColos: I understand...there is much to learn
[03:36] <MaHaGoN> hmm, I honestly don't have a howto ... here let me look around
[03:36] <Rug> zach634: 2am here in Windsor, ON
[03:36] <CPrgmSwR2> is really old hardware still supported?
[03:36] <maxxism> evening folks.
[03:37] <Halai> MaHaGoN: the mouse wheel upwards goes back in browser. the back mouse button scrolls a page in browser.
[03:37] <zach634> sweet.  someone has had only one serving of ramen today...
[03:37] <Halai> MaHaGoN: thanks.
[03:37] <Rug> CPrgmSwR2: yupp, as long as you have 32MB of ram you should be fine
[03:37] <maxxism> depends on how old? the hardware is.
[03:37] <ChocoCid> sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf i think
[03:37] <ChocoCid> mouse stuff's there
[03:37] <CPrgmSwR2> 512 MB of ram is what this computer has
[03:37] <ChocoCid> may not have to resort to that
[03:37] <soundray> zach634: sorry, out of suggestions now
[03:37] <bobbby> OmniColos: did you have any problem with the ethernet dirves, and audio drivers?
[03:37] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, mostly... and you can always install the kernel sources and compile your own...
[03:37] <ChocoCid> might be able to do it in system-preferences-mouse
[03:37] <soundray> zach634: hope you find a solution
[03:37] <zach634> soundray: thanks anyway
[03:37] <ChocoCid> on really old hardware i think xcfe is considered to be better because it has less *stuff*
[03:37] <Sierra> MarcN, thanks buddy!
[03:37] <bobbby> OmniColos: drivers*
[03:38] <OmniColos> I had ethernet woes until edgy then it had rivers for the 90x lom
[03:38] <maxxism> yes ChocoCid is right.
[03:38] <CPrgmSwR2> funkyHat does ubuntu release new kernels that are precompiled
[03:38] <Halai> MaHaGoN: would you mind if i paste you my mouse input x11 part and see if you can figure out whats wrong with it?
[03:38] <maxxism> xfce is light.
[03:38] <MaHaGoN> Halai: sure, lemme check it out
[03:38] <soundray> Halai: use pastebin
[03:38] <bobbby> OmniColos: 90x lom ?
[03:38] <soundray> !pastebin | Halai
[03:38] <ubotu> Halai: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[03:38] <Rug> maxxism: yes, flux/open box is more so
[03:38] <[BTF] Chm0d> i guess nobody here knows anything about vmware
[03:38] <CPrgmSwR2> because my freind knows VERY little about computers
[03:38] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, yeah
[03:38] <[BTF] Chm0d> http://pastebin.ca/247152
[03:38] <CPrgmSwR2> I hope he can just point click and it works
[03:39] <maxxism> Rug  me loves fluxbox
[03:39] <Rug> [BTF] Chm0d: What do you want to know?
[03:39] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, if you want pointing clicking and working then you want ubuntu :)
[03:39] <Rug> maxxism: same here
[03:39] <Halai> oops
[03:39] <Halai> sorry
[03:39] <CPrgmSwR2> okay good
[03:39] <funkyHat> Cor that sounded cheesy...
[03:39] <maxxism> Rug I like the GTK stuff in XFCE though
[03:39] <[BTF] Chm0d> Rug i am getting this error for install on edgy.  http://pastebin.ca/247152
[03:40] <MaHaGoN> Halai: try turning off emulate 3 buttons
[03:40] <Halai> MaHaGoN: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31359/
[03:40] <bobbby> OmniColos: 90x lom ?
[03:40] <Rug> maxxism: I think GUI's went down-hill since:  Load "game",8,1
[03:40] <zach634> LjL: how about adding a mounted ISO to apt?
[03:40] <maxxism> lol
[03:40] <Rug> [BTF] Chm0d: sorry I am not running edgy.
[03:40] <MaHaGoN> Halai: try setting emulate 3 buttons to false
[03:40] <maxxism> ahhh the good old Commodore 64.
[03:40] <LjL> zach634, never tried that, and i'm not sure where apt-cdrom actually looks for... perhaps try mounting it at /media/cdrom0 =)
[03:41] <CPrgmSwR2> what files work in ubuntu?
[03:41] <OmniColos> bobbby, 3c90x I think
[03:41] <Halai> MaHaGoN: lemme try that.
[03:41] <zach634> i think i might have found it..  thanks though
[03:41] <OmniColos> some marvel chipset
[03:41] <MaHaGoN> Halai: and if that doesn't work.. your "Button Mapping" is probably off, so change the numbers from 6 and 7 at the end to 4 and 5
[03:41] <CPrgmSwR2> are there any movie files that don't work under linux?
[03:41] <Halai> MaHaGoN: any way to test it without rebooting?
[03:41] <MaHaGoN> or.. a combination there of
[03:41] <[BTF] Chm0d> thx though Rug at least someone replied
[03:41] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, files?
[03:41] <maxxism> anyone ever run ubuntu on Commodore 64?   haha
[03:41] <CPrgmSwR2> I ment movie files
[03:41] <OmniColos> harhar
[03:41] <CPrgmSwR2> like wmf
[03:41] <CPrgmSwR2> or ram
[03:41] <funkyHat> ahh
[03:41] <Rug> maxxism: no, but mame has kept my C64 love alive
[03:41] <MaHaGoN> Halai:ctrl-alt-backspace will restart X, but it will shut down all programs... you wont have to fully reboot, but its a hassle
[03:42] <Trixsey> You guys know of any good HTTP Proxy Server to use with Ubuntu?
[03:42] <Halai> MaHaGoN: okay bbiab.
[03:42] <Rug> Trixsey: squid
[03:42] <CPrgmSwR2> apache2
[03:42] <maxxism> Rug  wow. mame does c64?
[03:42] <CPrgmSwR2> trixsey apache2
[03:42] <OmniColos> I wonder if there will be a PDA ubuntu  hto
[03:42] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, anything as long as it's not DRM'ed, and I think RealPlayer is in the repositories too (do you get to play DRMed realplayer files with that?)
[03:42] <Rug> maxxism: oh yeah
[03:42] <Trixsey> apache is not a http proxy? Id rather call that a HTTP server
[03:42] <bobbby> OmniColos: mm.. and the audio?
[03:42] <flodine_> can someone tell me why nautilus crashes like crazy
[03:42] <Rug> Trixsey: squid
[03:42] <MaHaGoN> ok, so does anyone have any idea on how to set up my computer to act as a signal repeater in edgy?
[03:42] <maxxism> Rug you ever play BC Bigwheel on c64?
[03:43] <flodine_> anyone
[03:43] <Trixsey> Proxy server as in tool for computer x to connect through computer y
[03:43] <OmniColos> audio worked fine for realtek drivers
[03:43] <Trixsey> ok thx Rug
[03:43] <Rug> maxxism: no
[03:43] <CPrgmSwR2> so does that mean he would not beable to listen to his itune songs?
[03:43] <Rug> maxxism: but I have played a lot.  I actually used to run a BBS on my C64
[03:44] <maxxism> haha.  sweet.
[03:44] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, songs he downloaded from iTunes I believe not, unencrypted aac files are fine though
[03:44] <Rug> 2 phones, C|net BBS, 1541 & 1581 floppy drives.
[03:44] <bobbby> OmniColos: ok ill search n find :()
[03:45] <Trixsey> Rug we share the same definition of http proxy server I hope? xP
[03:45] <Rug> Trixsey: yes
[03:45] <CPrgmSwR2> so he would need to burn them to a cd and then rerip them
[03:45] <jake> hi
[03:45] <OmniColos> bobbby, its should have just loaded
[03:45] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, yep that would work
[03:45] <Rug> http://www.squid-cache.org/
[03:45] <OmniColos> bobbby, what chipsets have you?
[03:45] <Trixsey> cool
[03:45] <CPrgmSwR2> isn't there a program to strip itunes drm
[03:46] <CPrgmSwR2> that some 17 year old made
[03:46] <Rug> CPrgmSwR2: yes there is
[03:46] <ubuntu_test> hi all. where can i find some additional ubuntu software source mirrors?
[03:46] <CPrgmSwR2> is that a windows program?
[03:46] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, ah, maybe... probably does the same thing as burning and re-ripping though...
[03:46] <Trixsey> By the way, you guys know why I can\t use any other keyboard layout than US? I have SE keyboard layout set in xorg.conf but its not working.. lolz

[03:48] <mcphail> [DFC] Eggman: yes. Just go to the repository and download
[03:48] <OmniColos> ubuntu_test, huge repository list: http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/blog/lista-repository-sourceslist-ottimizzata-per-ubuntu-kubuntu-linux/

[03:49] <air0day> that was unpleasant. ctrl-alt-bs'd accidentally
[03:49] <[DFC] Eggman> i dont see how
[03:49] <dudanogueira> does anyone sync palm with ubuntu edgy? how can i do that?
[03:49] <bimberi> !mountwindows | air0day
[03:49] <ubotu> air0day: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions (the !windowsdrives and !ntfs triggers are temporarily unavailable)
[03:49] <Rug> air0day: yeah, that happens
[03:50] <OmniColos> air0day, run irc in a terminal ;-)
[03:50] <funkyHat> air0day, oops!... umm... symlink /mp3 to /name/music?
[03:50] <air0day> bimber: its not a windows partition, its a network drive
[03:50] <[DFC] Eggman> say i want to download nethack
[03:50] <[DFC] Eggman> i need the nethack-common and nethack-x11
[03:50] <Rug> [DFC] Eggman: You want to download Nethack
[03:50] <mcphail> dudanogueira: i use gnome-pilot
[03:50] <mutilada> hello people, am new to ubuntu (have just installed it) can anybody tell me how can I change the video resolution? menu "screen resolution" does not allow more than 800x600 but my system works up to 1280x1024! help!

[03:50] <bimberi> air0day: ignore that stuff from ubotu, wrong info sorry
[03:50] <dudanogueira> mcphail, have to install it? i had added my device sucefully, but dont know what to do next :(
[03:50] <air0day> oh, alright
[03:51] <OmniColos> mutilada, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=156243   xorg configuraiton gui
[03:51] <bimberi> air0day: this is better - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently
[03:51] <air0day> rock on, thanks
[03:51] <mcphail> dudanogueira: just press the hotsync button on your palm
[03:51] <bimberi> np :)
[03:52] <CPrgmSwR2> does ubuntu have a dvd equavalent
[03:52] <Rug> My numberpad is no longer working.  any suggestions?
[03:52] <Rug> CPrgmSwR2: what do you mean?
[03:52] <air0day> bimben: it tells me to install smbfs.. is that a separate thing to do or is that a prereq for the other steps?
[03:53] <zach634> Rug: ooh, another idea...  perhaps your keyboard layout isnt set properly
[03:53] <mutilada> OmniColos: thanks!
[03:53] <mutilada> :D
[03:53] <ChocoCid> ubuntu has several DVD things
[03:53] <CptAJ[vzla] > Hey guys, anyone know how to adjust the brightness and gamma? My old CRT needs a little help...
[03:53] <MaHaGoN> Rug.. do you have your keyboard set up properly, like.. you wouldn't happen be set for an international keyboard when in reality you have a dvorak or something
[03:53] <orkid> PRESS NUMLOCK (?)
[03:53] <dudanogueira> mcphail, nothing happens :(
[03:53] <MaHaGoN> along with what zach just said
[03:53] <ChocoCid> how do i use GPG keys with regards to repositories?
[03:54] <Rug> I installed with US-101 defaults, so I can't imagine why it would change
[03:54] <mcphail> dudanogueira: you are sure you have set the device up properly? You are using USB?
[03:54] <CPrgmSwR2> I mean does ubuntu have a dvd with kubuntu xubuntu and ubuntu
[03:54] <ChocoCid> it has one for each
[03:54] <bimberi> air0day: it's a prerequisite
[03:54] <ChocoCid> and from any of them it's easy to install the others
[03:54] <dudanogueira> mcphail, yes.. it got my name on the device
[03:54] <ChocoCid> you can have all 3 of them at once, even
[03:54] <ChocoCid> and switch on login
[03:54] <bun-bun> ChocoCid# save the key file and use apt-key
[03:54] <CPrgmSwR2> okay
[03:54] <MaHaGoN> why not just sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop
[03:55] <ChocoCid> exactly!
[03:55] <jake> i did authomatic updates of restricted modules on Ubuntu and my sound stopped working. Anyone could help?
[03:55] <MaHaGoN> :)
[03:55] <ChocoCid> (except then you have a TON of redundancy)
[03:55] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, no, but it's quite possible to install kubuntu or xubuntu on top of ubuntu (or the other way) using apt :)
[03:55] <CPrgmSwR2> i see so just download ubuntu and I can install the rest
[03:55] <Rug> zach634: where are the keyboard layout files located?
[03:55] <ChocoCid> or download kubuntu or xubuntu then install the rest
[03:55] <ChocoCid> :P
[03:55] <ChocoCid> there's a cd for each
[03:55] <CPrgmSwR2> is there a way to change the start sceme
[03:55] <ChocoCid> yeah
[03:55] <ChocoCid> everything's customizeable
[03:55] <CPrgmSwR2> is there a way to change the startup sceme
[03:55] <zach634> Rug: no clue, i just had that idea
[03:55] <CptAJ[vzla] > So, no one knows about the brightness/gamma thing?
[03:56] <bimberi> !usplash | CPrgmSwR2
[03:56] <ubotu> CPrgmSwR2: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[03:56] <CPrgmSwR2> Awsome
[03:56] <ChocoCid> there's even one for the GRUB menu
[03:56] <CPrgmSwR2> because I hate the ubuntu start sceme
[03:56] <ChocoCid> my GRUB menu has a picture of Tux :P
[03:56] <MaHaGoN> ... I am scared, I tried to help Halai set up his xorg.conf for his mouse.. and he hasn't come back yet...
[03:56] <CPrgmSwR2> so does mine
[03:56] <zendainc> can someone here help me out, i have a agere systems ET-131x PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet network card and run ubuntu and windows on the same laptop, but for some reason i cant connect to the internet on ubuntu
[03:56] <[DFC] Eggman> !wine
[03:56] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[03:56] <Rug> ChocoCid: You actually reboot?
[03:56] <CPrgmSwR2> of the penquin
[03:56] <funkyHat> CPrgmSwR2, maybe start with kubuntu or xubuntu, they have blue startup screens I believe :)
[03:56] <ChocoCid> Rug: i'm on a laptop
[03:56] <mcphail> dudanogueira: gnome-pilot is a little erratic. Try killing all of the gpilotd processes, and then kill the gpilot-applet and reload
[03:56] <CPrgmSwR2> and then it stays in the background on all consoles
[03:56] <Rug> ChocoCid: nice excuse.  =)
[03:57] <ChocoCid> lol
[03:57] <CPrgmSwR2> if there is a way to change it htough - then it doesn't matter
[03:57] <funkyHat> true ^-^
[03:57] <Rug> ChocoCid: What brand and how well does hybernate work?
[03:57] <ChocoCid> HP and well, i guess
[03:57] <ChocoCid> i just see no reason to bother :P
[03:57] <air0day> bim: that worked! the linux community sure is friendlier now than it was last time i tried to drop windows ;)
[03:57] <CPrgmSwR2> linux has matured more since then
[03:57] <ChocoCid> and i do occasionally have to dual boot into EvilOS for a specific app that doesn't work on WINE
[03:57] <bimberi> air0day: great
[03:58] <MaHaGoN> I am on my windows partition now :-X
[03:58] <Rug> ChocoCid: I love that name,  can I borrow it?
[03:58] <zendainc> can someone here help me out, i have a agere systems ET-131x PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet network card and run ubuntu and windows on the same laptop, but for some reason i cant connect to the internet on ubuntu
[03:58] <dudanogueira> mcphail, sweeeeeeeeeeet
[03:58] <ChocoCid> sure, i'll license it under the GPL >_>
[03:58] <mcphail> dudanogueira: working?
[03:58] <Rug> hehe
[03:58] <dudanogueira> mcphail, if you come to brazil, ill pay you a beer :)
[03:58] <CPrgmSwR2> wow kde4 is out
[03:58] <ChocoCid> wow who cares, gnome ftw
[03:58] <ChocoCid> <_<
[03:58] <Rug> CPrgmSwR2: really?  in the repos too?
[03:58] <mcphail> dudanogueira: i'll book my tickets :)
[03:58] <MaHaGoN> .. no it isn't
[03:59] <funkyHat> ehehe :P
[03:59] <ChocoCid> probably not in the repos
[03:59] <MaHaGoN> I think some dev packages are out, nothing but source
[03:59] <ChocoCid> ubuntu takes a while to get them in the repo's even after the official release
[03:59] <dudanogueira> mcphail, i runned from console, and it told me: watching /dev/pilot....
[03:59] <CPrgmSwR2> it is in the repos thats how I found out about it
[03:59] <CPrgmSwR2> http://www.kubuntu.org/
[03:59] <ChocoCid> nice
[03:59] <CPrgmSwR2> if you go to that webpage you can see that
[03:59] <MaHaGoN> yeah, snapshot
[03:59] <ChocoCid> don't care much, but nice
[04:00] <ChocoCid> gnome ftw :P
[04:00] <MaHaGoN> thats actually 3.8.* whatever
[04:00] <zendainc> can someone here help me out, i have a agere systems ET-131x PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet network card and run ubuntu and windows on the same laptop, but for some reason i cant connect to the internet on ubuntu, how can i fix this
[04:00] <ChocoCid> "* whatever"?
[04:00] <ChocoCid> i find it somewhat funny that someone geeky enough to use * feels the need to throw "whatever" after it
[04:00] <Tarvok> Can someone help me? For some reason, the dialer in the "networking" app can't find my modem. I have managed to connect using wvdial, but I'd prefer to use the networking app. Currently using Dapper, straight off the Live CD.

[04:01] <joel___> Hi everyone
[04:01] <MaHaGoN> hey joel :
[04:01] <joel___> I have a problem installing acer_acpi on my ubuntu machine, I wonder if anyone can help.
[04:01] <zendainc>  can someone here help me out, i have a agere systems ET-131x PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet network card and run ubuntu and windows on the same laptop, but for some reason i cant connect to the internet on ubuntu, how can i fix this so i can connect to the internet through my home network
[04:01] <joel___> I get the following message when doing sudo modprobe acer_acpi
[04:01] <Rug> Hiya joel___    PQ ?  I guess the french should be allowed to use Ubuntu too!  =)
[04:02] <joel___> FATAL: Error inserting acer_acpi (/lib/modules/2.6.15-27-amd64-generic/extra/acer_acpi.ko): No such device
[04:02] <joel___> Rug: Sure, why not :p
[04:03] <Rug> joel___: Are you using a laptop?
[04:03] <roughtrader> I installed RTM vista today
[04:03] <joel___> Rug: Yes I am
[04:03] <roughtrader> that is one awful OS
[04:03] <Rug> damn, I was about to buy one.
[04:03] <Tarvok> My message scrolled past top, no response. I guess I'll try the forums, and just use wvdial in the meantime.
[04:03] <CPrgmSwR2> what is wrong with vista?
[04:03] <Rug> roughtrader: from FisherPrice to TeleTubbies?
[04:03] <roughtrader> yup
[04:03] <roughtrader> it's ugly
[04:03] <MaHaGoN> yeah, sorry Tarvok, I have no idea
[04:03] <roughtrader> I can't do what I want in it
[04:03] <air0day> is there more involved with playing mp3s than installing an mp3 player?
[04:03] <roughtrader> it feels so bloated
[04:03] <Rug> Can you switch to classic theme?
[04:04] <Tarvok> NP. Thanks anyway.
[04:04] <ChocoCid> air0day: occasionally restricted formats come into play
[04:04] <ChocoCid> !restricted formats
[04:04] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:04] <air0day> well they're just regular mp3s
[04:04] <CPrgmSwR2> What about the 3d task switcher
[04:04] <CPrgmSwR2> in vista
[04:04] <ChocoCid> might need the mp3 codec
[04:04] <CPrgmSwR2> does that at least work
[04:04] <ChocoCid> i'm sure it "works as coded", CPrgmSwR2
[04:04] <air0day> !mp3 codec
[04:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mp3 codec - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:04] <air0day> darn
[04:04] <roughtrader> I played with vista about 15 minutes, but then got so disgusted I rebooted back into my ubuntu drive
[04:04] <ChocoCid> it is an EvilCo. production after all
[04:05] <CPrgmSwR2> Windows lost me with its DRM
[04:05] <air0day> rough: vista is why im trying to switch to linux right now :)
[04:05] <ChocoCid> yeah
[04:05] <Rug> ChocoCid: yeah I still love that name
[04:05] <ChocoCid> vista is really quite ridiculous :(
[04:05] <CPrgmSwR2> then when I switch to linux I was like wow this is awsome
[04:05] <zendainc>  can someone here help me out, i have a agere systems ET-131x PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet network card and run ubuntu and windows on the same laptop, but for some reason i cant connect to the internet on ubuntu, how can i fix this so i can connect to the internet through my home network
[04:05] <Rug> air0day: congrats
[04:05] <CPrgmSwR2> it all started with customization of kde
[04:05] <Explosif> !p2p
[04:05] <ubotu> Conventional P2P clients: Limewire/GTK-Gnutella/Frostwire (Gnutella Network).  -  BitTorrent: see !torrent  -  Direct connect: try valknut.  -  Also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/P2PFileSharing for general information.
[04:05] <ChocoCid> the biggest issue linux has right now really is marketing :(
[04:05] <air0day> choco: where do i get the mp3 codec? is that just a package?
[04:05] <ChocoCid> i'll be honest with you there
[04:05] <roughtrader> I'm finally at the point with linux, thanks to ubuntu, where I have more flexibility than Mac OS X
[04:05] <lakkaaa> hello all :)
[04:05] <CPrgmSwR2> I don't think linux has to market anything
[04:05] <ChocoCid> yes it does
[04:05] <ChocoCid> the average user has no clue what linux is like
[04:05] <Rug> air0day: w32codecs
[04:06] <air0day> choco: well, everyone i know who made the jump (most of the people at work) switched because of xgl and the easy of ubuntu
[04:06] <ChocoCid> before i tried it i thought it was purely command line
[04:06] <CPrgmSwR2> it seems to be picking up by word of mouth
[04:06] <lakkaaa> anyone who can help me setup my creative audigy 2 @ ubuntu>
[04:06] <lakkaaa> ?
[04:06] <air0day> its a bit harder to get up and running than i'd like, unfortunately
[04:06] <ChocoCid> the biggest issue with "getting it up and running" is the restricted formats
[04:06] <air0day> i think wifi is a big issue for people too, though im connected directly so its not an issue for me
[04:06] <MaHaGoN> compiz made my productivity shoot down
[04:06] <CPrgmSwR2> thats the biggest problem facing linux is setup
[04:06] <ChocoCid> well yeah, that and wifi
[04:06] <MaHaGoN> I would sit there and wiggle windows around
[04:06] <zach634> how do i delete a user>
[04:06] <ChocoCid> "easy to use" and "free formats" don't work together that well for setup and install :(
[04:06] <ChocoCid> zach634 : system - administration - users
[04:06] <lakkaaa> or can someone point me in the right direction?
[04:07] <Rug> zach634: rmuser
[04:07] <roughtrader> I should say, gnome is actually more flexible than OS X
[04:07] <roughtrader> but OS X is pretty damn sweet
[04:07] <ChocoCid> don't use the command line if you don't have to :P
[04:07] <zach634> aint no rmuser!
[04:07] <ChocoCid> (at least not in helping people!)
[04:07] <dk0r> roughtrader: OSX is sweet-
[04:07] <zach634> well, in this case i have to use the cli
[04:07] <CPrgmSwR2> I couldn't get compiz to work but beryl worked great however it slows everything down
[04:07] <Rug> ChocoCid: whodunnit?
[04:07] <joel___> !acer_acpi
[04:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about acer_acpi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:07] <ChocoCid> !acpi
[04:07] <Crankymonky> If anyone here has installed Debian Etch, In the Etch NetInstall (or any install for that matter)  If I de-select standard system, will that leave me with nothing just just the base system
[04:07] <zach634> !rmuser
[04:07] <Rug> ChocoCid: what?
[04:07] <ubotu> acpi: displays information on ACPI devices. In component main, is optional. Version 0.09-1 (edgy), package size 10 kB, installed size 72 kB (Only available for i386 ia64 amd64)
[04:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rmuser - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:07] <bimberi> zach634: deluser
[04:07] <roughtrader> the eye candy that vista uses looks so damn awful
[04:08] <ChocoCid> telling people how to do stuff via command line (if they're not the type of person who cares about command line) is not going to teach them anything
[04:08] <roughtrader> it was a pathetic attempt to copy OS X
[04:08] <MaHaGoN> and just think, you have to pay EXTRA for the eye candy
[04:08] <air0day> rug: i dont see a w32codecs in synaptic.. is that for mp3s? whats the "w32" for?
[04:08] <zach634> bimberi: that's more like it
[04:08] <roughtrader> but doesn't come anywhere close
[04:08] <ChocoCid> going "system-administrator-user" is something that people would like
[04:08] <CPrgmSwR2> I actually like the eye candy in vista
[04:08] <EpP> is it possible to virtualize windows from a partitoin its installed on. Rather that from and image file
[04:08] <ChocoCid> and i'm going to be a hypocrite and... air0day: sudo apt-get install w32codecs
[04:08] <zendainc>  can someone here help me out, i have a agere systems ET-131x PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet network card and run ubuntu and windows on the same laptop, but for some reason i cant connect to the internet on ubuntu, how can i fix this so i can connect to the internet through my home network
[04:08] <lakkaaa> anyone knows how i can get my creative audigy 2 running under ubuntu?
[04:08] <Rug> ChocoCid: that is their problem, not mine
[04:08] <ChocoCid> wireless is a horrible horrible issue :(
[04:08] <bimberi> zach634: except that it can be read as   de-luser  ;)
[04:08] <CPrgmSwR2> I thinkt the bluegreen color scheme is pretty neat
[04:08] <air0day> how come its w32? that smells of windows to me, but these are just regular mp3s...
[04:08] <ChocoCid> air0day: it is windows
[04:09] <CPrgmSwR2> but I do hate how restrictive windows is
[04:09] <MaHaGoN> well thats broadcoms fault, eww
[04:09] <ChocoCid> w32 codecs are the windows 32-bit codecs
[04:09] <abo> lakkaaa, I have audigy 2 running w/o any prob
[04:09] <air0day> mp3s are windows?
[04:09] <ChocoCid> yeah, broadcom :(
[04:09] <EpP> is it possible to virtualize windows from a partitoin its installed on. Rather that from and image file
[04:09] <ChocoCid> air0day: they're often in windows codecs
[04:09] <CPrgmSwR2> oh and the biggest mistake windows made was getting rid of dos
[04:09] <OmniColos> air0day, enable multiverse and universe repos in synaptic
[04:09] <air0day> omni: i did
[04:09] <ChocoCid> if you don't have w32codecs you will have issues with media files all the time
[04:09] <Belboz99> hey all, does the mv command delete the copied files after each file is copied or once all the files are copied?
[04:09] <ChocoCid> CPrgmSwR2: really they should get rid of dos and replace it with unix :P
[04:09] <OmniColos> air0day, then search for gstreamer bad and ugly
[04:10] <ChocoCid> Belboz99: uh... does it... matter?
[04:10] <ChocoCid> o_O
[04:10] <Belboz99> ChocoCid: yes it does
[04:10] <CPrgmSwR2> lol ChocoCid the sad thing is that it would actually be better for linux oh and it could come true
[04:10] <CPrgmSwR2> I mean better for windows
[04:10] <Belboz99> ChocoCid: I ran out of disk space part way through moving my  home directory
[04:10] <ChocoCid> well yes, it'd be better for windows
[04:10] <ChocoCid> it'd suck less
[04:10] <ChocoCid> it'd still suck though :(
[04:10] <CPrgmSwR2> Microsoft I think is setting the stage to adopt the linux kernel
[04:11] <ChocoCid> uh... they can't
[04:11] <ChocoCid> GPL
=== _Genrl_Zo is now known as Genrl_Zod
[04:11] <ChocoCid> they'd have to open up all kinds of stuff they definitely don't want to
[04:11] <OmniColos> there is also a licenced mp3 codec for linux now tho its not oss
[04:11] <zach634> CPrgmSwR2: isnt that ibm?
[04:11] <CPrgmSwR2> they found away around it
[04:11] <abo> is it possible after fine tuning all Ubuntu drivers/packages/updates to create an install CD from all that, to be able to restore the system to that state any other time?
[04:11] <ChocoCid> abo: you can image the system
[04:11] <air0day> im sorry, im not following.. which gstreamer package do i install to playback regular, non-drm mp3 files?
[04:12] <zach634> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKZA9ri7M
[04:12] <CPrgmSwR2> I forget what its called but basically they insert some software into the kernel and run programs off that software
[04:12] <ChocoCid> just install all of them :P
[04:12] <OmniColos> gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3
[04:12] <ChocoCid> uh, CPrgmSwR2 , that would blatantly violate the GPL
[04:12] <MaHaGoN> why not automatix2 the codecs.. and plugins for firefox
[04:12] <EpP> is it possible to virtualize windows from a partitoin its installed on. Rather that from and image file
[04:12] <ChocoCid> automatix causes problems for a lot of people
[04:12] <ChocoCid> EpP: i don't think so?
[04:12] <CPrgmSwR2> have you read the recent news about microsoft and novell
[04:13] <ChocoCid> yes
[04:13] <EpP> ChocoCid, automatix never was a problem for me
[04:13] <ChocoCid> they're not adopting the kernel
[04:13] <Rug> Easy Ubuntu works good
[04:13] <MaHaGoN> yeah, neither for me
[04:13] <ChocoCid> automatix helped mangle my dapper install so...
[04:13] <LjL> !automatix
[04:13] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[04:13] <ChocoCid> !easyubuntu
[04:13] <ubotu> easyubuntu is easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/  -  For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[04:13] <CPrgmSwR2> its predicted that vista adoption will be slow
[04:13] <EpP> someone should rewrite that. Its worked fine for me on 12 workstations.
[04:13] <ChocoCid> they're making a business partnership with regards to patents
[04:13] <strabes> ive never had a problem with automatix
[04:13] <air0day> that worked, mp3s are playing now. i installed an ffd thing.. i take it that means i installed a bunch of video codecs as well then?
[04:13] <troopa> I am seriously considering switching to the I386 version of Ubuntu, due to the 64-bit version having small issues. Would this be recommended?
[04:14] <CPrgmSwR2> So is that going to be bad for us
[04:14] <ChocoCid> the whole point of this is to kill red hat
[04:14] <EpP> strabes, agreed
[04:14] <MaHaGoN> yeah, I haven't had any issues with it.. and I use it quite often myself
[04:14] <ChocoCid> that's really what they're trying to do
[04:14] <roughtrader> is it possible to convert bin/cue to iso?
[04:14] <Rug> troopa: just use the x86 for your distro
[04:14] <Rug> troopa: ack, your cpu
[04:14] <EpP> troopa, yes. Its more supported and easiier to manage.
[04:14] <CPrgmSwR2> is that going to be bad for linux if they kill red hat
[04:14] <ChocoCid> yeah
[04:14] <CPrgmSwR2> do you think microsoft will kill red hat
[04:14] <ChocoCid> right now red hat is the big player in the server world
[04:14] <MaHaGoN> well guys I am on my way out, gl to those of you I couldn't help out :)
[04:15] <ChocoCid> novell is behind them with SLES/SLED
[04:15] <EpP> centOS is moving up.
[04:15] <ChocoCid> *business world
[04:15] <ChocoCid> now Oracle's "Unbreakable Linux" is coming out
[04:15] <troopa> I just don't think the minimal performance gain (none, really -- because there aren't enough applications that fully support 64-bit) is worth the hassle of always replacing libraries with 32-bit versions.
[04:15] <ChocoCid> and Microsoft is partnering with Novell to increase interoperability
[04:15] <troopa> It kind of defeats the point, I think. lol.
[04:15] <CPrgmSwR2> hmm
[04:15] <CPrgmSwR2> not sure what to make of all this
[04:15] <bimberi> roughtrader: bchunk
[04:15] <ChocoCid> so now businesses are going to be... "do i want to use Oracle Linux since it'll work better with my databases or SUSE because microsoft's partnership will make them work better with my workstations?"
[04:16] <CPrgmSwR2> I guess microsoft is trying to take control of the server industry
[04:16] <EpP> troopa, i386 is better because its what everyone uses. So more support.
[04:16] <ChocoCid> and of course the patent FUD is going to make idiot managers go "well if we don't use the one microsoft says it's okay to use they might sue us"
[04:16] <CPrgmSwR2> can they?
[04:16] <roughtrader> thanks bimberi
[04:16] <ChocoCid> ask SCO
[04:16] <EpP> LINUX PWNS!!!!
[04:16] <bimberi> roughtrader: yw :)
[04:16] <CPrgmSwR2> that answers it
[04:16] <ChocoCid> microsoft can definitely pull this crap off with patent nonsense
[04:17] <ChocoCid> the SCO case, while "unsucessful" legally did scare people away from linux
[04:17] <Explosif> anyone else use frostwire?
[04:17] <ChocoCid> if you don't think this will scare some businesses away from non-novell linux you're pipe dreaming
[04:17] <CPrgmSwR2> then why does microsoft off a truce with redhat?
[04:17] <EpP> nme
[04:17] <EpP> Expl
[04:17] <EpP> Explosif, i do
[04:17] <CPrgmSwR2> or does it give them power to control red hat?
[04:17] <ChocoCid> same power they have to control novell now
[04:17] <CPrgmSwR2> if redhat makes a truce with Microsoft
[04:17] <ChocoCid> as long as they're getting kickbacks they're happy
[04:17] <CPrgmSwR2> ah okay
[04:18] <ChocoCid> i'm sure microsoft is getting kickbacks from suse now
[04:18] <jbu> what is the currently recommended cluster HA solution with ubuntu?
[04:18] <ChocoCid> they're keeping the deal secret and shady
[04:18] <Explosif> EpP, did you get a syntax error when you tried to run it the first time?
[04:18] <CPrgmSwR2> ubuntu right now is the most popular linux distro
[04:18] <kitche> CPrgmSwR2: Novell and Microsoft been working togeter for a long time actually
[04:18] <ChocoCid> CPrgmSwR2 : on the desktop
[04:18] <ChocoCid> servers are largely red hat, sun's Solaris, and of course NT server
[04:18] <roycebarber> I'm....not getting QuickTime panoramas to work in Firefox.....
[04:18] <CPrgmSwR2> isn't that going to start hurting microsoft
[04:18] <EpP> Explosif: no, but i read something about that, hold on
[04:18] <ChocoCid> red hat is *the* dominant server distro
[04:18] <fatejudger> I just installed the new Edgy via clean install and can't seem to see the bootsplash screen
[04:19] <CPrgmSwR2> I mean ubuntu
[04:19] <fatejudger> it worked in Dapper
[04:19] <ChocoCid> oh
[04:19] <fatejudger> but no longer in Edgy
[04:19] <CPrgmSwR2> is ubuntu going to start cutting into microsoft shares
[04:19] <ChocoCid> ubuntu is cutting into the desktop market, i think
[04:19] <ChocoCid> i think microsoft is shooting themselves in the foot on the desktop, honestly
[04:19] <AdamKili> i need serious help. In dapper, my wi-fi card worked fine. Now i have a fresh install of edgy and can't get it to show up in the System>Administration>Networking i followed the exact instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/acx111 and no luck (i didn't even use that guide in edgy). I don't want to be tethered to my DSL router!!!
[04:19] <ChocoCid> but really
[04:19] <ChocoCid> people are locked in
[04:19] <CPrgmSwR2> why are they locked in?
[04:19] <ChocoCid> you can't buy a PC without EvilOS on it at best buy or whatever
[04:19] <roycebarber> Can we stay on the Ubuntu topic in this chat room. Btw anyone else having QuickTimeVR Panorama issues in firefox.
[04:20] <ChocoCid> even if you remove it and install linux, microsoft still has your money
[04:20] <CPrgmSwR2> I see
[04:20] <CPrgmSwR2> So it doesn't even matter if ubuntu is installed because the source of revenue comes from the manufacturer
[04:20] <caveMan> where are drivers on desktop mounted? they aren't in  /mnt
[04:20] <EpP> Explosif, open frostwire execuatble with gedit ok?
[04:20] <OmniColos> adam are you using WPA on your acx111
[04:20] <ChocoCid> CPrgmSwR2 : i'm going to message you
[04:20] <CPrgmSwR2> I have a feeling walmar is the only store that can fix the problem
[04:20] <durrie> Anyway to emulate a windows dialup program on Ubuntu? I have Netscape Internet Service which has a web accelerator and a dialer for it.
[04:20] <CPrgmSwR2> okay
[04:20] <Explosif> EpP, the shell script?
[04:21] <EpP> yes
[04:21] <tamacracker> Hey guys, I have a question about Totem and playing .wma files on webpages
[04:21] <bimberi> ChocoCid, CPrgmSwR2: or use #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[04:21] <OmniColos> er AdamKili ,  are you using WPA on your acx111
[04:21] <air0day> man, that automounting the smb:// thing has screwed stuff up really bad... stuff is freezing all over. i cant even run a terminal window right now :/
[04:21] <AdamKili> OmniColos: no WAP
[04:21] <AdamKili> WEP
[04:21] <AdamKili> *
[04:22] <bimberi> air0day: that's no good to hear.  I haven't used it myself, just knew about the HowTo :/
[04:22] <Explosif> EpP, k, its open
[04:22] <OmniColos> AdamKili, hmm the drivers should work ok
[04:22] <EpP> look on the first line for #!/bin/sh
[04:22] <air0day> well now i just want to get a terminal window open.. it says "starting.." but then the window never comes up, and eventually the thing on the taskbar just disappears
[04:22] <Explosif> EpP, its there
[04:22] <tamacracker> Can anyone here go to www.song2play.com and see if your totem plays the .wma files?
[04:22] <OmniColos> maybe install nm-applet
[04:22] <EpP> change sh to bash
[04:23] <bimberi> air0day: try alt-F2 and run 'xterm'
[04:23] <air0day> how do i get back to this desktop?
[04:23] <OmniColos> alt-f7 I think air0day
[04:23] <durrie> Anyway to emulate a windows dialup program on Ubuntu? I have Netscape Internet Service which has a web accelerator and a dialer for it.
[04:23] <bimberi> air0day: not ctrl-alt-F2, just alt-F2.  It opens a window where you can run commands
[04:24] <Knome> when i try to boot my linux machine, i get "Error 17" at the grub bootloader
[04:24] <air0day> no dice.. no error or anything, but no terminal either
[04:24] <Knome> What does that mean, and how do i fix it
[04:24] <ludovicus> hey all i got dvd's working and wmv files... but unfortunately no sound
[04:24] <Explosif> EpP, still gives me a syntax error
[04:25] <OmniColos> lol I alt-f4'ed
[04:25] <EpP> Explosif, google ubuntu frostwire syntax

[04:37] <tamacracker> Does anyone find Dapper Drake to be a lot faster in performance compared to Edgy?
[04:38] <MercuryMan> Anyone in here run an ATI card with beryl? I'm trying to set it up for a friend and it's just not going .. well.
[04:38] <bimberi> nope, opposite
[04:38] <bruenig> tamacracker, I did. Until I switched to xubuntu which was obviously faster than dapper gnome
[04:38] <alexgnu> hello im a newbie irc-user
[04:38] <tamacracker> opposite?!?! lol
[04:38] <bruenig> !hi | alexgnu
[04:38] <ubotu> alexgnu: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:38] <OmniColos> AdamKili, if you get gnome-netowork-gnome you can start it with nm-applet
[04:38] <tamacracker> wait Xubuntu Edgy is faster than Ubuntu Edgy?
[04:38] <ChocoCid> edgy was faster for me
[04:38] <ChocoCid> Xubuntu is obv faster
[04:38] <ChocoCid> because XCFE is more lightweight than GNOME
[04:38] <bruenig> tamacracker, ha
[04:38] <bimberi> tamacracker: edgy faster than dapper for me
[04:38] <ChocoCid> edgy boots faster than dapper
[04:39] <AdamKili> OmniColos: i was just about to ask that
[04:39] <tamacracker> it boots faster yes
[04:39] <OmniColos> it stumped me at first too
[04:39] <tamacracker> but it runs like shit
[04:39] <ChocoCid> Xubuntu will probably always be fastter than Kubuntu or Ubuntu
[04:39] <bruenig> ChocoCid, yeah as that is its design. I rather like the quickness
[04:39] <tamacracker> but is Xubuntu as powerful?
[04:39] <ChocoCid> not sure what you mean
[04:39] <bruenig> tamacracker, I do everything on xubuntu that I did on ubuntu
[04:39] <ChocoCid> it has different apps by default
[04:39] <alexgnu> now im run a probe
[04:39] <ChocoCid> but it'll run whatever programs
[04:40] <tamacracker> oh i didn't know this.
[04:40] <OmniColos> AdamKili, you can always look at the package details =>installed files in synaptic though
[04:40] <bruenig> tamacracker, the default apps, if you don't like them you can just change. I liked totem-xine, so I got it. Like rhythmbox so I got it.
[04:40] <ChocoCid> XCFE/KDE/GNOME are just desktop managers with packages of programs
[04:40] <ChocoCid> KDE uses Kate. GNOME uses Gedit.
[04:40] <ChocoCid> etc
[04:40] <OmniColos> ehy x
[04:40] <tamacracker> ah i see
[04:40] <MercuryMan> tamacracker: Xubuntu simply runs xfce4 and all it's goodies as Ubuntu runs all Gnome's and Kubuntu runs KDE's .. they are all similar in power, but each have their own WM/Desktop Manager. Xubuntu is less resource hungry.
[04:40] <bruenig> xubuntu mousepad
[04:40] <ChocoCid> yeah
[04:40] <ChocoCid> different terminal emulators
[04:40] <ChocoCid> and so forth
[04:40] <lane> Only 20 minutes till house yipee
[04:41] <alexgnu> hola ... alguien sabe espanol????
[04:41] <ChocoCid> I like the GNOME interface (occasionally with beryl)
[04:41] <ChocoCid> !es
[04:41] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[04:41] <tamacracker> will Cross Over office install on Xubuntu?
[04:41] <ChocoCid> sure
[04:41] <ChocoCid> crossover doesn't care much about X/K/G
[04:41] <ChocoCid> if it does, get whatever libraries
[04:41] <tamacracker> sweeet
[04:41] <CITgu1> has anyone got a tv tuner card to work on Edgy?
[04:41] <HypnoToad> gday
[04:41] <tamacracker> may I ask, what's the difference between Xfc4 and Gnome?
[04:41] <bruenig> I thought about putting beryl on xubuntu just to be confusingly contradictory
[04:42] <ChocoCid> hahaha
[04:42] <OmniColos> hey aaron
[04:42] <ChocoCid> tamacracker: a lot
[04:42] <aaron> hey
[04:42] <ChocoCid> you can try them out for yourself
[04:42] <ball> tamacracker: about three metric tonnes
[04:42] <ChocoCid> sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop to try out XCFE
[04:42] <ChocoCid> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop to try out gnome
[04:42] <From> anyone as new to ubuntu as I am?
[04:42] <ChocoCid> and apt-get remove when you find which one you don't like
[04:42] <OmniColos> aaron I found a nice respository for the latest beryl
[04:42] <bruenig> From, what are your issues if any?
[04:42] <ball> From: I'm even newer
[04:42] <jerp> I look at it like Gnome is the luxury car, KDE is the monster truck and Xfce is sports car
[04:42] <bimberi> bruenig: perhaps if you had high-end graphics card on a PII :)
[04:42] <bruenig> I don't even use ubuntu, that is how new I am
[04:42] <AdamKili> OmniColos: it's still not listed in System>Administration>Networking
[04:42] <aaron> oh ya... how did you know i have beryl
[04:43] <tamacracker> if i get xubuntu right now, will it change any of my settings?
[04:43] <ball> bruenig: me neither ;-)
[04:43] <HypnoToad> I've got xinerama setup to support a second monitor. If I launch xnvc4viewer in fullscreen mode it uses both monitors. How can I get around that?
[04:43] <From> no issues at the moment, except that I cant find where to change my ID in Xchat
[04:43] <OmniColos> try iwconfig command , AdamKili
[04:43] <bruenig> tamacracker, no. If you do sudo aptitude install xubuntu-desktop. All of your apps and stuff will be the same, you will just get new stuff. You will be able to pick xfce from the login menu.
[04:43] <OmniColos> lucky guess Aaron
[04:44] <tamacracker> wooot
[04:44] <zendainc> im trying to connect to the internet through my windows network but my wired network card is only sending packets and not recieving, why would tihs be happeneing and how can i fix it so that i can use the internet on ubuntu
[04:44] <tamacracker> ok im gonna try it
[04:44] <bruenig> tamacracker, I always hated two DE on one install so once I figured out how to do everything on xfce I just reformatted
[04:44] <aaron> lol. so whats the url
[04:44] <tamacracker> cuz right now it's currently sluggish
[04:44] <gleesond> so I keep having to reset my /etc/resolv.conf is there a way to make it stick to the setting I give it?
[04:44] <tamacracker> what's wrong with having two different DEs on one install?
[04:44] <tamacracker> takes up space?
[04:45] <bruenig> tamacracker, nothing. It was always too cluttered for me
[04:45] <tamacracker> oh ok :D
[04:45] <bruenig> I am a bit anal about simplicity
[04:45] <bruenig> and minimalism
[04:45] <tamacracker> lol i understand
[04:45] <ball> I like Blackbox
[04:45] <AdamKili> OmniColos: it just has lo, eth0, and sit0 in one column and no wireless extensions three times in a second column

[04:46] <AdamKili> OmniColos: that's ok. see ya

[04:48] <bruenig> a-l-p-h-a, go to that restricted page and follow the instructions.
[04:48] <Alabuntu> my real question is: is Firefox my only browsing choice for Ubuntu?? Cause I hate Firefox...
[04:48] <at0m> whas the key command to get back out of shell ? alt + cntrl + f1
[04:49] <HypnoToad> yes

[04:50] <roughtrader> how do I create an img file as an image of the contents of a floppy disk?
[04:50] <Alabuntu> firefox just tends to hang too long for me
[04:50] <troopa> Opera might be something that you could try out. It is a fairly nice browser, imho.
[04:50] <strabes> at0m: ctrl + alt + F7
[04:50] <strabes> at0m: 1-6 are virtual terminals
[04:51] <NewcomerXb> Hey you guys
[04:51] <Alabuntu> im probably wrong, but I feel as though Firefox waits until all info is gathered before displaying, while WinExplorer layers it in as it gets it
[04:51] <alexgnu> ehh... sorry what is the slackware channel... sorry...!
[04:51] <NewcomerXb> I dont understand why i cant run winxp off my internal now tyhat i switched motherboards.
[04:52] <Alabuntu> cause windows is the devil
[04:52] <ChocoCid> ##slackware
[04:52] <NewcomerXb> amen, but i have stuff on it
[04:52] <HypnoToad> Ah well, maybe I just come back later and hope there's someone here who can answer my question
[04:52] <Alabuntu> i just installed Ubuntu today, and I will never be going back to Windows
[04:52] <NewcomerXb> and i cant edit the hard drive for some reason, i dont have permissions
[04:52] <ChocoCid> use sudo
[04:52] <ChocoCid> but if it's ntfs you don't want to screw with it most likely
[04:52] <troopa> NewcomerXb: Load a LiveCD that has NTFS-captive or similar, mount the NTFS partition and copy the information from one drive to another or something.
[04:53] <NewcomerXb> ohhh
[04:53] <troopa> Then you can wipe the drive, and use it for something else.
[04:53] <tamacracker> How do I switch to Xubuntu once I install it?
[04:53] <TehUni> NewcomerXb: it's not safe to edit a NTFS filesystem in linux. It's possible, but not recommended.
[04:53] <bimberi> tamacracker: choose xfce from the sessions menu at the login screen
[04:53] <HypnoToad> cu dudes
[04:53] <tamacracker> Login menu right?>
[04:53] <NewcomerXb> okay
[04:53] <tamacracker> oh ok
[04:53] <tamacracker> brb
[04:53] <at0m> whats the terminal command to show all drives and where they are mounted?
[04:53] <NewcomerXb> ill need to switch in... i do need windows for certain games
[04:54] <troopa> TehUni: He would not need to edit the filesystem to copy information from it.
[04:54] <TehUni> NewcomerXb: then you want to dual-boot

[04:59] <Linuturk> ChocoCid: the config files that are in use during the copy won't go, so I came to the failsafe terminal to copy, but I don't know a) how to mount the external and b) the cp command I should use
[04:59] <Keyseir> I'm having a lot of problems with intermittent nautilus crashes on edgy. Is there a way to replace nautilus with another file manager that might not be buggy, or has anyone found any sort of solution for the wierd nautilus problems?
[05:00] <NewcomerXb> some people prefer 'frostwire', but i never looked for that
[05:00] <ChocoCid> do man mount
[05:00] <Alabuntu> limewire is a system hog... so I can find a downloader through the package manager?
[05:00] <Linuturk> well, I'm using irssi right now . . .
[05:00] <ChocoCid> Keyseir: sudo apt-get install thunar
[05:00] <Keyseir> !ubotu thunar
[05:00] <ubotu> thunar: File Manager for Xfce. In component main, is optional. Version 0.4.0svn+r23151-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 384 kB, installed size 2956 kB
[05:00] <bruenig> frostwire is garbage in the same way as azureus. Java sucks
[05:00] <NewcomerXb> like i said, gtk-gnutella is teh way to go
[05:00] <Linuturk> ChocoCid: I'll have to leave irc to do any commands
[05:01] <NewcomerXb> and yes, its in the add/remove programs dialogue
[05:01] <NewcomerXb> :)
[05:01] <Alabuntu> there was a time when I used WinMX and never since have I found a client that works better
[05:01] <NewcomerXb> I missed that program!
[05:01] <NewcomerXb> WinMX found what you want so quickly
[05:01] <ChocoCid> Linuturk: use screen
[05:01] <bimberi> Keyseir: You could do some debugging and report bugs - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash
[05:01] <Alabuntu> it was great wasnt it?
[05:01] <ChocoCid> you can make multiple screens
[05:01] <bruenig> Alabuntu, yeah, you may have to enable extra repositories, people in here I am sure will be able to help you in that
[05:01] <Linuturk> exit
[05:01] <Linuturk> bah
[05:01] <MaHaGoN> lol
[05:01] <ChocoCid> sigh
[05:01] <NewcomerXb> it was perfect. then it updated and became crap.
[05:01] <ChocoCid> hopefully he knows how to use screen :(
[05:01] <MaHaGoN> yeah idk choco :-/
[05:01] <Alabuntu> i was on the horn with my brother for over an hour letting him talk me through enabling MP3 support
[05:02] <at0m> whats the command to show all drives that are not yet mounted?
[05:02] <NewcomerXb> Answer at0m someone, i have eben wondering the same!
[05:02] <bimberi> at0m: sudo fdisk -l
[05:02] <MaHaGoN> !ubotu automatix
[05:02] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[05:02] <bruenig> sudo fdisk -l will list all the disks, mounted or not
[05:02] <kintaro0e> hi guys..when i start login in to my desktop[gnome]  there are applications that will starts up..like gnome-terminal and gedit..i check in the SESSIONS and delete the applications.when i restart still it will comes out..how to stop this..?any advice..
[05:02] <MaHaGoN> grrrrr
[05:02] <NewcomerXb> bless you :D
[05:03] <MaHaGoN> Why does it say that about automatix, geez, someone really really needs to change that, lol
[05:03] <Alabuntu> damnit man, I just installed automatix, don't say things like that
[05:03] <bruenig> !automatix
[05:03] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[05:03] <MaHaGoN> automatix2 is quite good, I just used it actually on this computer
[05:03] <MaHaGoN> everything is fine
[05:03] <Alabuntu> 2 is what I got
[05:03] <bruenig> !works for me
[05:03] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[05:03] <MaHaGoN> I have yet to see any problems arise from it
[05:03] <NewcomerXb> So how shall i begin trying to dual boot back into Windows XP so i can clear up some stuff? :/
[05:03] <Alabuntu> automatix was crucial in my search for mp3 support
[05:03] <MaHaGoN> !ubotu I am a freaking loser that doesn't use automatix
[05:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I am a freaking loser that doesn't use automatix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:03] <NewcomerXb> Im on a system with WINXP on an external and UBUNTU on an external :)
[05:04] <bruenig> !msg the bot
[05:04] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[05:04] <NewcomerXb> WINXP=internal i mean
[05:04] <Alabuntu> how does one enable file sharing in Ubuntu?
[05:05] <NewcomerXb> just run gtk-gnutella =)
[05:05] <NewcomerXb> install it of course
[05:05] <bruenig> MaHaGoN, automatix has the ability to hose a system. It finally hosed one of mine after using it on 8 or 9 installs flawlessly. The point in discouraging here is that since there is a fullproof way to do it yourself. Why even risk it, especially when you have 20+ people in here that could get it working for you for sure.
[05:06] <ChocoCid> really should just have one long command string on the wiki
[05:06] <ChocoCid> oh, wait... there is one!
[05:06] <Alabuntu> file sharing? anyone?
[05:06] <bruenig> ChocoCid, about to say. This text based sarcasm is hard to detect
[05:06] <NewcomerXb> Could anyone at least give me a starting point? I really want to access XP on the internal... how can i find out which device number it is at least?
[05:06] <NewcomerXb> mbr is gone from it though so i cant just disconnect the external
[05:07] <bruenig> Alabuntu, you want gtk-gnutella?
[05:07] <bimberi> Alabuntu: System -> Administration -> Shared Folders
[05:07] <mabreaux> NewcomerXb: check out samba
[05:07] <Alabuntu> thanks yo
[05:07] <NewcomerXb> !samba
[05:07] <Alabuntu> i will track down gtk through the package manager later
[05:07] <NewcomerXb> whats samba
[05:07] <bruenig> Alabuntu, that is what I thought you meant by file sharing, my fault
[05:07] <Alabuntu> all is well
[05:08] <mabreaux> NewcomerXb: samba is the files sharing tool for ubuntu to xp
[05:08] <rukuartic> Hey everyone, I've made a bash script that I'd like to be run on Log-out from Gnome. Can anyone tell me how to get Gnome to run scripts on logout?
[05:08] <NewcomerXb> no i need winxp to run my games lol
[05:08] <NewcomerXb> thats what its for after all. that and nothing else
[05:08] <Alabuntu> file sharing right in the menu... guess i need to check it all out before I ask retarded questions...
[05:09] <Alabuntu> what games art thou running Xb?
[05:09] <tuko> good night
[05:09] <MaHaGoN> good night :)
[05:09] <at0m> whats the linux equivelant of winamp?
[05:09] <NewcomerXb> all kinds, off and on. old dos games up to new ones.
[05:09] <rukuartic> at0m: xmms
[05:09] <at0m> cool thanks
[05:09] <MaHaGoN> at0m: xmms but I would recommend amarok myself :)
[05:09] <rukuartic> at0m: If I'm right, WinAmp came form xmms.
[05:09] <NewcomerXb> sims2
[05:10] <Alabuntu> i play CS, but since I downloaded Google Earth i havent played anything
[05:10] <rukuartic> MaHaGoN: Eh... Amarok's like Songbird. Bloated.
[05:10] <tuko> mplayer
[05:10] <bruenig> at0m, or beep media player
[05:10] <tuko> jejeje
[05:10] <Alabuntu> the standard player in Ubuntu will do mp3, you just have to enable it
[05:10] <rukuartic> at0m: bruenig 's right... but I'm not sure what differences there are.
[05:10] <MaHaGoN> ruk: I know, but I like the fact that it is combined with magnatune
[05:10] <NewcomerXb> well i gotta go guys, my girlfriend's begging... cya =)
[05:11] <bruenig> I couldn't see any difference between xmms and beep as except the look a bit different in terms of colors and stuff. Other than that they appeared to act the same
[05:11] <tuko> what are the config files of alsa in ubuntu ? dont u know some man or how to , to edit these files?
[05:11] <Alabuntu> make sure to pump her up to 20 psi.,... damn he left before I could type
[05:11] <MaHaGoN> lol
[05:11] <tamacracker> Boooooo
[05:11] <tuko> can anyone help me ? :S
[05:11] <bruenig> !offtopic | tamacracker
[05:11] <ubotu> tamacracker: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!

[05:12] <tamacracker> Xubuntu doesn't let you change the opacity
[05:12] <Alabuntu> mahagon, is that /action ??
[05:12] <bruenig> tamacracker, it is a low resource basic DE, what did you expect
[05:12] <ChocoCid> it's /me
[05:12] <MaHaGoN> it is /me
[05:12] <Alabuntu> ok
[05:12] <rukuartic> tuko: whatcha need help with?
[05:12] <tuko> thank u rukuartic
[05:12] <tuko> what are the config files of alsa in ubuntu ? dont u know some man or how to , to edit these files?
[05:12] <Alabuntu> i havent used IRC since 1998 when I played Team Fortress
[05:13] <tamacracker> lol i dunno bro
[05:13] <MaHaGoN> I just decided to open up irc today to fix a problem, yet no one seems to be able to help me :(
[05:13] <bruenig> !patience
[05:13] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[05:13] <rukuartic> tuko: To edit configuration files, I like using nano. Not sure where the config files are.
[05:13] <tamacracker> i've gotta re-evaluate if I want to stay with edgy or go back to dapper drake
[05:13] <burzum> rukuartic /etc
[05:14] <MaHaGoN> tamacracker, what would make you want to revert?
[05:14] <bruenig> going back to dapper is for babies. ha now you can't because the previous statement would indicate that doing so would make you a baby
[05:14] <rukuartic> burzum: No, for alsa... there's no /etc/alsa.conf or /etc/alsa/
[05:14] <tamacracker> dapper drake looked as fancy as edgy, but it performed a hell of a lot better
[05:14] <Alabuntu> dont leave edgy... dont fruit the beer
[05:14] <tamacracker> it ran smoother
[05:14] <burzum> rukuartic, and whats your problem exactly?
[05:14] <tuko> rukartic i only know /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
[05:14] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, ok, I'm getting errors from ~/.nautilus/
[05:14] <rc-1> um a site jsut said i need activeX to play a video, is there a way to use this in firefox?
[05:15] <rukuartic> tuko: Ah! I found it. /usr/share/alsa/
[05:15] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, when I try to copy
[05:15] <Alabuntu> firefox detects needed plugins
[05:15] <tamacracker> and for some reason, when my screen saver is open for about an hour, my PC runs horrific... and I have to force restart my machine.
[05:15] <ChocoCid> if you're on the command line you're not going to use nautilus?
[05:15] <tuko> burzum:  i need to edit these files to add a card...
[05:15] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, I booted back into the system
[05:15] <bruenig> Alabuntu, the auto install of plugins in firefox in linux is generally troublesome
[05:15] <tamacracker> Ubuntu Dapper Drake on GNOME > Ubuntu Edgy Eft on GNOME
[05:15] <ChocoCid> just sudo cp -r /home/* hdaN
[05:15] <Alabuntu> i got mac flash right off the bat
[05:15] <ChocoCid> er
[05:15] <ChocoCid> more like /media/hdaN
[05:15] <Alabuntu> on my first ubuntu incursion
[05:15] <MaHaGoN> ok, quick question, is there a way to use nautilus so you dont have to like navigate to each sub directory by clicking, or can you just like type /etc/X11/ etc
[05:15] <bimberi> rc-1: I doubit it.  maybe IE under wine.
[05:16] <ChocoCid> you can, MaHaGoN
[05:16] <ChocoCid> alt-f2, nautlius /etc
[05:16] <ChocoCid> or just type it in the bar
[05:16] <bruenig> Ubuntu Edgy Eft GNOME = Ubuntu Dapper Drake GNOME < Xubuntu Edgy Eft Xfce
[05:16] <MaHaGoN> the bar?
[05:16] <ChocoCid> the address bar in nautlius
[05:16] <MaHaGoN> I don't have one
[05:16] <rc-1> there must be a workaround though, cause same site worked when i had dapper
[05:16] <bimberi> MaHaGoN: ctrl-L
[05:16] <ChocoCid> uh...
[05:16] <ChocoCid> yeah
[05:16] <ChocoCid> that
[05:16] <bimberi> :)
[05:17] <MaHaGoN> thank you oh so very much
[05:17] <at0m> i mounted a drive and it says i dont have permisson to do it... have to change permissions ?
[05:17] <at0m> to view it rather
[05:17] <MaHaGoN> you have no idea how much that has bothered me since I came over from Mepis and its lovely Konqueror
[05:17] <tuko> try with sudo
[05:17] <tamacracker> bruenig but i enjoy having transparent tool bars :(
[05:17] <at0m> i sudo mounted it and i can sudo view the dir listing
[05:17] <bruenig> tamacracker, what does that really do for you come on
[05:17] <at0m> but it shouldnt be necessary?
[05:17] <Alabuntu> will ubuntu put less workload on the exploding-battery Inspiron 5100s?? Cause that's what Im running
[05:17] <tamacracker> or i mean panels
[05:17] <tamacracker> fanciness :D
[05:17] <bruenig> MaHaGoN, you can get konqueror if you want it
[05:17] <ChocoCid> heh
[05:17] <flodine_> anyone use gmpc that can help
[05:17] <ChocoCid> get Beryl if you want fanciness!
[05:18] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, i'm getting a lot of this: "cp: cannot create symbolic link 'file': Operation permitted"
[05:18] <ChocoCid> symbolic links? in your home directory? ow.
[05:18] <MaHaGoN> bruenig, yeah, I know.. I actually did on my laptop, haven't gotten around to it on this desktop
[05:18] <ChocoCid> i'd just ignore them, considering that you're backing up
[05:18] <bruenig> MaHaGoN, sudo aptitude install konqueror, it is waiting for you
[05:18] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, I'll pastebin the terminal when it finishes
[05:18] <ChocoCid> or
[05:18] <ChocoCid> actually
[05:18] <ChocoCid> no
[05:18] <ChocoCid> do the same thing only add the -L flag
[05:18] <ChocoCid> that fixes it
[05:19] <MaHaGoN> lol bruenig, I know I know... and apt-get == better
[05:19] <flodine_> can someone tell me why reconfigure-mpd dont work in edgy?
[05:19] <Linuturk> should I stop the current one then?
[05:19] <ChocoCid> or -s instead of -L
[05:19] <fit4lfe> getting a subprocess post-installation script error returned error exit status 1
[05:19] <ChocoCid> sure
[05:19] <fit4lfe> can anyone help
[05:19] <ChocoCid> read man cp
[05:19] <ChocoCid> and decide whether you want -s or -L
[05:19] <MaHaGoN> fit4life, I honestly have no clue on how to help you there man, gl tho
[05:19] <JJGotit> hello everybody
[05:19] <Alabuntu> i gots to run, thanks for the many helps
[05:19] <bruenig> MaHaGoN, I generally prefer apt-get because of its Super Cow Powers but on apps like konqueror where you have to install nearly all of the KDE libs to get it working. Auto dependency tracking is nice
[05:19] <MaHaGoN> hey JJGotit :)
[05:19] <flodine_> help
[05:20] <MaHaGoN> bruenig, hence why I shall stick with nautilus now that I can just.. you know, type instead of aimlessly search for folders
[05:20] <bruenig> MaHaGoN, the terminal works well. cd /wherever
[05:20] <fit4lfe> can anyone else help me
[05:21] <MaHaGoN> bruenig, oh dont get me started on the terminal.. I just spent 5 hours staring at the terminal trying to set up an AP with dhcp... I dont want to open a terminal for a while, lol
[05:21] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, so a -s will copy the links, and a -L will try to copy what they are linking too?
[05:21] <MaHaGoN> bruenig, I actually didn't even get anywhere :-/
[05:21] <ChocoCid> Linuturk yep
[05:21] <ChocoCid> depends on what you want
[05:21] <ChocoCid> as in what you're using the backup for
[05:21] <bruenig> the terminal is great. Nothing shows off your greatness then when you fire up the terminal to do very simple tasks
[05:21] <rukuartic> fit4lfe: Whats going on?
[05:22] <flodine_> come on someone uses mpd
[05:22] <fit4lfe> subprocess post installation script error exit status 1
[05:22] <rukuartic> fit4lfe: thats not too descriptive. What were you doing when that happened?
[05:22] <fit4lfe> when using apt-get
[05:22] <fit4lfe> upgraded to edgy
[05:22] <tamacracker> ack!! my photoshop 7.0 is missin on xfc4
[05:22] <rukuartic> fit4lfe: Ah. Could you /msg me the entire problem?
[05:22] <ChocoCid> ...photoshop? on linux?
[05:23] <ChocoCid> ...lol :(
[05:23] <at0m> how do you write to NTFS ?
[05:23] <tamacracker> xfce4 doesn't show my photoshop icon :\
[05:23] <ChocoCid> uh
[05:23] <rukuartic> at0m: Very carefully.
[05:23] <ChocoCid> photoshop on linux? wtf?
[05:23] <bruenig> tamacracker, just open a terminal and then run, gimp
[05:23] <ChocoCid> use krita anyway
[05:23] <tamacracker> but i installed photoshop...
[05:23] <AdamKili> i have a VERY WEIRD mess up in Firefox. whenever I try to go to www.gnome-look.org it goes to www.bbc.co.uk's website!!!
[05:23] <MaHaGoN> !ubotu krita
[05:23] <rukuartic> at0m: Fact is, there are a few things that let you do that. But its a really bad idea, because you could end up borking your partition.
[05:23] <ubotu> krita: a pixel-based image manipulation program for the KDE Office Suite. In component main, is optional. Version 1:1.5.2-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 2463 kB, installed size 7768 kB
[05:23] <tamacracker> photoshop > gimp  X3000
[05:23] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, well, I keep my root and /home directories on seperate partitions. I want to back this up incase my drive goes, so I can just restore the /home partition on a new hard drive and have all my preferences and such.
[05:23] <MaHaGoN> have you tried the photoshop like UI for gimp?
[05:24] <MaHaGoN> the name escapes me atm
[05:24] <rukuartic> JJGotit: Pose yer question, someone'll get to you :3
[05:24] <bruenig> !anyone | JJGotit
[05:24] <ubotu> JJGotit: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:24] <tamacracker> GIMP needs a lot of work to even compare it to Photoshop.
[05:24] <ChocoCid> gimpshop?
[05:24] <globe> JJGotit: go ahead and ask your question....helpers lurk
[05:24] <rukuartic> MaHaGoN: GimpShop
=== MewMeow is now known as Mewshi
[05:24] <MaHaGoN> yeah chococid thats it
[05:24] <tamacracker> photoshop can do a lot more than gimp without the hassle
[05:24] <fit4lfe> did you get the msg rukuartic
[05:24] <ChocoCid> tamacracker: try krita
[05:24] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, so, I should use -s for that
[05:24] <ChocoCid> probably
[05:24] <MaHaGoN> I just wish there was a decent alternative to Autodesk Inventor :-/
[05:24] <rukuartic> fit4lfe: Oh, I've forgotten. People need to be registered to whisper.
[05:25] <MaHaGoN> only reason I still have windows on my laptop
[05:25] <Duane> sudo mysqladmin -u root password newrootsqlpassword
[05:25] <rukuartic> fit4lfe: Try pasting it up at this website http://pastebin.com
[05:25] <Duane> I do that command and get an error?
[05:25] <fit4lfe> hows that
[05:25] <ChocoCid> heh
[05:25] <AdamKili> help: in Firefox. whenever I try to go to www.gnome-look.org it goes to www.bbc.co.uk's website!!! weird huh?

[05:26] <Duane> anyone know why I Cant connect to mysql?
[05:26] <JJGotit> :)
[05:26] <Lathiat> Duane: your need to specify a password?
[05:26] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, cp -s -r -v /home/folder /media/drive  correct?
[05:26] <bruenig> wow he finally came out of /me
[05:26] <MaHaGoN> ... don't make me abuse that poor bot by spamming the patience..
[05:26] <ChocoCid> sure, if you're a -v fan
[05:26] <Duane> i think so Lathiat
[05:26] <ChocoCid> looks fine to me
[05:26] <Duane> I tryed
[05:26] <Duane> sudo mysqladmin -u root password newrootsqlpassword
[05:27] <Duane> changing where it said newrootsqlpassword to what i wanted
[05:27] <Duane> but i get that error
[05:27] <Lathiat> Duane: to use a password you go
[05:27] <Lathiat> Duane: mysql -u root -p
[05:27] <Lathiat> Duane: then it asks for a password
[05:27] <rukuartic> Duane: You could try erasing your database if you forgot the root password and generating a new one
[05:27] <Lathiat> Duane: but you need the password to chang eit.. what did you change it to in the first place?
[05:27] <Duane> ok thanks Lathiat
[05:27] <gumpish> So, there's no such thing as ndiswrapper for powerpc then?
[05:27] <Duane> no I just installed mysql

[05:29] <bruenig> wow he thanked globe for telling him to google it, what next a thank you for rtfm
[05:29] <JJGotit> I tried not only with ubuntu
[05:29] <globe> bruenig: ...
[05:29] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, all that did was create a bunch of symbolic links . . . :-/
[05:29] <ChocoCid> ...wtf?
[05:29] <ChocoCid> it made everything symbolic?
[05:29] <MaHaGoN> wait, what linuturk?
[05:29] <rukuartic> JJGotit: Some times, some hardware just doesn't work with linux, because it was designed to only work with windows. Not sure how to get it working for you
[05:29] <ChocoCid> use -L
[05:30] <Linuturk> yeah ChocoCid, nothing but links on the external
[05:30] <MaHaGoN> ChocoCid seemed right on with what he was saying... idk, do you know what he forgot choco?
[05:30] <ChocoCid> yeah
[05:30] <ChocoCid> should be -L instead of -s
[05:30] <AdamKili> chococid: how do i check the DNS? sorry i repeated so quickly, i was doing something else and wasn't sure how log i had actually waited
[05:30] <robin_> would someone try to send me a file, I am trying to set up the ports on my router, thx
[05:30] <JJGotit> [rukuartic] : my problem isn't that
[05:30] <AdamKili> long*
[05:30] <JJGotit> I have a pctel and a lucent v90
[05:30] <ChocoCid> i'm an idiot and parsed "only make symbolic links" as "makes copies of the symbolic links" instead of "does a symbolic link"
[05:30] <ChocoCid> sorry about that
[05:30] <ChocoCid> nothing like misreading the FM
[05:30] <JJGotit> both work separated, but not at the same time
[05:30] <ChocoCid> !dns
[05:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dns - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:31] <ChocoCid> :(
[05:31] <rukuartic> JJGotit: Heh, sorry. I'm not much of a modem specialist.
[05:31] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, yeah, it took a few seconds, and I was like . . . that can't be right
[05:31] <ChocoCid> heh
[05:31] <ChocoCid> yeah use -L instead of -s
[05:31] <ChocoCid> sorry
[05:31] <JJGotit> I am a 3rd world dweller
[05:31] <MaHaGoN> !DHCP
[05:31] <JJGotit> :(
[05:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about DHCP - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:31] <ChocoCid> sigh
[05:31] <bruenig> !dhcp
[05:31] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, but, it is still complaining about a lot of files
[05:31] <ubotu> dhcp: DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0pl5-19.4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 108 kB, installed size 308 kB
[05:32] <MaHaGoN> thx bruenig :-P
[05:32] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, did use -L
[05:32] <Linuturk> ChocoCid, still complaining
[05:32] <robin_> anyone mind if i try to send them a file to see if my ports are open
[05:32] <ChocoCid> i can't really help you then :(
[05:32] <ChocoCid> i suggest letting it finish
[05:32] <bruenig> robin_, you got virus.exe right?
[05:32] <ChocoCid> then look at the outcome
[05:32] <ChocoCid> and see what you want to see
[05:32] <robin_> yes thxc
[05:32] <robin_> thx
[05:32] <ChocoCid> er, see if it is what you want to see
[05:32] <Linuturk> fine
=== jman_ is now known as jerk_man
[05:33] <gregben> Hello, got a 6.06LTS box on a lan with DHCP provided by Linksys WRT54G. hostname doesn't show in Linksys DHCP active ip table, but ip itself does. How to make hostname appear?
[05:33] <ChocoCid> if not maybe try tarballing the entire /home directory and copying that
=== caveMan is now known as caveMan-
[05:33] <globe> has anybody ever seen a blank printer driver list for hp printer?....ubuntu detects it but doesn't seem to have any drivers
=== caveMan- is now known as caveMan1
[05:33] <caveMan1> (sorry for nick flood just trying to find one that wasn't taken)
[05:33] <ChocoCid> uh
[05:33] <ChocoCid> if it let you have the nick, it wasn't taken?
[05:34] <caveMan1> both of the previous ones were
[05:34] <ChocoCid> oh, you mean registered
=== jerk_man is now known as jman_
[05:34] <caveMan1> yeah
[05:34] <bruenig> ah but it is implied that caveMan is caveMan1, you should in the very least be caveMan2
[05:34] <ChocoCid> lol
[05:35] <ChocoCid> doesn't freenode carry things over now?
[05:35] <MaHaGoN> grr, I just started cups to set up a printer... and my audio went out
[05:35] <ChocoCid> so having blahblah registered gives you access to ?blahblah?
[05:35] <aleka> Silly Question.. if anyone can help >> Where can I find the file "training.dat" where thunderbird stores its junk filter control tokens??
[05:36] <ChocoCid> do locate training.dat
[05:36] <rukuartic> aleka: Worst worst worst case, open a terminal and "find / -name training.dat"
[05:36] <Linuturk> ok, how do I stop .trash directories from being created on my drives?
[05:36] <ChocoCid> heh, no idea
[05:36] <Linuturk> I can't delete the .trash_root drive on my external, even as root
[05:36] <MaHaGoN> linaturk, aren't those used in MacOS?
[05:37] <aleka> I guess the locate command did it.. was wondering how to search from terminal anyways/// Thanks Chocosid
[05:37] <gregben> What network service is used to expose hostname on lan?
[05:37] <rukuartic> aleka: Woah, the locate option's so much better
[05:38] <babo>   /join #mysql
[05:38] <lazzareth> I am trying to install Akamaru ( http://people.freedesktop.org/~krh/akamaru.git/ ) but the build fails because it cant find gconf-2.0 so i went to the debian website and downloaded the gconf package but it said that i already have this package install and it is of a later version? Could somebody please help me get this to build
[05:38] <lazzareth> ?
[05:38] <MaHaGoN> linuturk, if you use that in your Mac, I believe it requires those files, don't quote me on it tho
[05:38] <moviebuff> Hi, I am new to linux, I just downloaded the ubuntu 6.06 CD, would like to install it on a partition along with Windows XP pro. are there any issues with this, one of my friends had a few so he aborted the installation
[05:38] <crimsun> lazzareth: don't grab stuff from the Debian Web site
[05:39] <crimsun> lazzareth: you need libgconf2-dev
[05:39] <MaHaGoN> moviebuff, there should be no problem, just make sure you do the "edit partitions manually" and not use the entire disk
[05:39] <Linuturk> MaHaGoN, I don't own a mac
[05:39] <lazzareth> Ahh
[05:39] <Linuturk> MaHaGoN, ubuntu created these files
[05:39] <MaHaGoN> linuturk.. then I have no clue man, lol
[05:39] <ChocoCid> wow
[05:39] <ChocoCid> probably just put a trash thing
[05:40] <ChocoCid> since you deleted stuff in there i assume (from the prior copy)
[05:40] <lazzareth> Thankyou crimsun, It is building correctly now
[05:40] <MaHaGoN> linuturk, the only times I have seen files like that thrown on my drives is when I use it on a mac
[05:40] <ChocoCid> or it got copied over, which trashed some stuff
[05:40] <ChocoCid> yeah, a mac really screwed over one of my flash drives once
[05:40] <ChocoCid> rednaxel: have fun playing with windows for the next hour
[05:40] <v3rmap> Hi, I shared my home directory on Ubuntu Dapper, using SMB. (Open Nautilus, right click & select "Share Folder"). When I try to access the Ubuntu m/c from a Windows box (\\192.168.1.50), it pops up a password dialog. Despite my entering the correct username/password it still pops up that dialog again. Any suggestions?
[05:40] <MaHaGoN> moviebuff, do you have any questions or specific worries?
[05:40] <ChocoCid> a 1 gig flash drive, and it threw a trash thing that filled up the entire drive... -_-
[05:41] <Linuturk> ok, I sent a sudo rm -r -d -f .Trash-root to the terminal
[05:41] <Linuturk> and I'm getting access denied
[05:41] <ChocoCid> o_O
[05:41] <MaHaGoN> try sudo su?
[05:41] <ChocoCid> ..sudo su?
[05:41] <rukuartic> ChocoCid: he means sudo -i
[05:41] <rukuartic> ChocoCid: It gives you a bash terminal as root.
[05:42] <lazzareth> make install   of the built packages however returned another error  "install: cannot create regular file `/home/mason/bin/kiba-dock': No such file or directory"
[05:42] <ChocoCid> ..huh.
[05:42] <globe> you can also sudo -s
[05:42] <flodine_> can someone tell me why reconfigure-mpd dont work in edgy?
[05:42] <ChocoCid> how... odd
[05:42] <ChocoCid> why does linux need THAT many ways of becoming root? :\
[05:43] <MaHaGoN> sry... once again, coming from Mepis, I deserved that
[05:43] <MaHaGoN> I used to just have to su.. :-/
[05:43] <ChocoCid> heh
[05:43] <ChocoCid> -i and -s do different things, how odd
[05:43] <ChocoCid> and just *slightly* different
[05:43] <Arrick> Hey guys, under ubuntu breezy, how do I either lock the keyboard, or lock the computer so my aps stay running, but keyboard input wont destroy my pages when the cat walks on the keyboard?
[05:43] <ChocoCid> uh...
[05:43] <ChocoCid> lock screen on screensaver?
[05:43] <MaHaGoN> arrick.. that is the coolest question I have heard all night :-P
[05:43] <Arrick> uhmmm, how?
[05:43] <ChocoCid> or just click the shutdown button and then lock screen instead of shut down
[05:44] <ChocoCid> (assuming breezy worked like dapper/edgy on this)
[05:44] <globe> what is on localhost:631
[05:44] <globe> L
[05:44] <globe> ?
[05:44] <rukuartic> Arrick: If you go into System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts, you can set a keyboard combo to "Lock Screen". I have mine set to ctrl+alt+delete
[05:44] <MaHaGoN> yeah, but can he do that quickly enough before the cat owns his work
[05:44] <rukuartic> globe: Open up a terminal and type in "lsof | grep 631"
[05:44] <ChocoCid> heh
[05:44] <[erisco] > how do I browse my network on ubuntu"?
[05:44] <Arrick> ok, lock screen shows up in system>
[05:44] <ChocoCid> i have control-alt-super set to terminal :D
[05:44] <Arrick> never saw that before, however will this lock the keyboard?
[05:44] <ChocoCid> sure
[05:45] <ChocoCid> do it and find out
[05:45] <ChocoCid> (be ready to type your pass in)
[05:45] <Arrick> dont mind that
[05:45] <ChocoCid> the only way your cat could screw stuff up
[05:45] <globe> rukuartic: is there a way to seperate out http servers?
[05:45] <ChocoCid> would be if it could type in your password :P
[05:45] <Arrick> awesome
[05:45] <rukuartic> Arrick: Not entirely, you have to type your password in so locking the KB would be a bad thing.
[05:45] <MaHaGoN> and if he could do that, he deserves to get in and screw with your apps
[05:45] <Arrick> thanks for making me look guys, have fun
[05:45] <rukuartic> globe: You mean, figure out which one's running on a certain port?
[05:45] <ChocoCid> yeah
[05:46] <ChocoCid> i think if the cat manages to get past your pasword it deserves to nuke your computer :P
[05:46] <Arrick> hey, locking the screen and putting a prompt is a good thing
[05:46] <Arrick> lol
[05:46] <globe> rukuartic: yea...I mean other than typing it in  firefox...
[05:46] <[erisco] > how do I connect to other computers over a network?
[05:47] <ChocoCid> ssh ?
[05:47] <MaHaGoN> !iptables
[05:47] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[05:47] <MaHaGoN> firestarter doesn't work for me :-/
[05:47] <rukuartic> globe: I'm not quite sure what you mean...
[05:47] <rednaxel> ChocoCid, why do you think I'm going to play with Windows for the next hour?
[05:47] <globe> rukuartic: there is an http server running @ localhost:631.  Just curious what processes is running it
[05:47] <ChocoCid> huh?
[05:48] <ArrenLex> Is anyone else having tons of problems with edgy? I've downgraded 20 or so packages to dapper to make it useable... openoffice (fonts), kde (slowness)...
[05:48] <ChocoCid> i meant windows, not Windows
[05:48] <ChocoCid> ;[
[05:48] <rukuartic> globe: Odd. Urm... just a second.
[05:48] <ChocoCid> as in, beryl's wobbly windows
[05:48] <MaHaGoN> XGL!!
[05:48] <ChocoCid> XGL != beryl :P
[05:48] <ChocoCid> just because most of what people use XGL for is the fancy window manager...
[05:48] <MaHaGoN> and beryl != compiz
[05:48] <ChocoCid> well yes
[05:48] <ChocoCid> you use one or the other
[05:49] <ChocoCid> but XGL doesn't have to have beryl OR compiz
[05:49] <MaHaGoN> mhm
[05:49] <rednaxel> ChocoCid, ah, ok... that's funny
[05:49] <MaHaGoN> you are correct sir
[05:49] <rednaxel> but the "cube" is nicer
[05:49] <MaHaGoN> I prefer beryl myself
[05:49] <ChocoCid> same
[05:49] <MaHaGoN> I found it much easier to setup, even on my crappy integrated intel on my lappy
[05:49] <me|ong> can anybody help me with a problem i'm having wiht uninstalling programs?
[05:49] <phrizer> The hole 3D-desktop thing, strikes me as strange.
[05:50] <phrizer> why have a "cube'ed" desktop?
[05:50] <rukuartic> globe: Ur, not quite sure. you could try "ps aux | grep httpd" to see if you have any webservers...
[05:50] <phrizer> s/hole/whole
[05:50] <MaHaGoN> me|ong sudo apt-get uninstall <package>
[05:50] <ChocoCid> it's a graphical version of your 4 workspaces
[05:50] <ChocoCid> and allows you to have one window on two workspaces (via overlapping it)
[05:50] <rednaxel> phrizer, why an alpinist climb a mountain?
[05:50] <ChocoCid> the cube is really minor
[05:50] <Keyseir> Is it possible to set the default file manager to something other then nautilus on gnome [edgy]  [and not screw everything up] ?
[05:50] <me|ong> fuck
[05:50] <moviebuff> thanks MaHaGoN. I will try installation and be back if I run into problems.
[05:50] <ChocoCid> Keyseir : make it thunar i assume?
[05:50] <me|ong> i tried autoremove but nothign happened lol
[05:50] <rukuartic> !expletives
[05:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about expletives - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:50] <ChocoCid> it's apt-get remove
[05:50] <Keyseir> ChocCid, yes, that's what I'd like to do
[05:50] <gregben> Hi. When I ping my ubuntu box hostname is not returned. How do I make ubuntu box respond with hostname?
[05:50] <ChocoCid> not apt-get uninstall
[05:51] <MaHaGoN> moviebuff no problem, and if I am not around when you get back I am sure people will help you
[05:51] <rukuartic> gregben: modify /etc/hosts
[05:51] <me|ong> so wait
[05:51] <me|ong> i was doing it right then
[05:51] <DBO> me|ong, please lay off the swearing =)
[05:51] <me|ong> i did a remove
[05:51] <ChocoCid> remove, not autoremove
[05:51] <me|ong> and autoremove..
[05:51] <me|ong> BUT
[05:51] <me|ong> i tried to reinstall it and now it won't configure it...
[05:51] <gregben> rukuartic: thx, what to do to /etc/hosts?
[05:51] <Keyseir> ChocoCid,  yes, that's what I'd like to do
[05:51] <ChocoCid> hrm
[05:51] <me|ong> i'm tryign to install dovecot...
[05:51] <MaHaGoN> grrrr, I am really dropping the ball :-/
[05:52] <ChocoCid> not sure how to make it be thunar instead of nautilus
[05:52] <ChocoCid> hold on
[05:52] <Keyseir> I guess I might have to switch to Xubuntu or something ;-/
[05:52] <Keyseir> ok
[05:52] <rednaxel> the ctrl-alt-tab is nice too
[05:52] <ChocoCid> no there's a way to do it
[05:52] <globe> rukuartic: hmm.. oh well.  cups has an http based administration there.  Any Idea how to shut it off?
[05:52] <Keyseir> Sweet
[05:52] <rukuartic> gregben: Just put something that says "123.45.67.89   hostname"
[05:52] <rukuartic> gregben: and make sure you don't mess up the localhost ones!
[05:52] <ChocoCid> i just need to FIND it
[05:52] <ChocoCid> :P
[05:52] <rednaxel> and the thing it does when you move the mouse to the bottom left corner
[05:52] <Keyseir> Hopefully a way that doesn't break a lot of stuff
[05:52] <Keyseir> hehe, ok
[05:53] <ChocoCid> it shouldn't
[05:53] <Keyseir> nods
[05:53] <me|ong> dovecot-common                                  deinstall
[05:53] <cge> Is there a way to keep EVMS from starting up in the Dapper boot from the LiveCD? It seems to keep causing a SeekComplete error on an apparently nonexistent SATA hdd
[05:53] <ChocoCid> there should be a "what program opens what file" thing somewhere
[05:53] <me|ong> why is it still there even though i removed?
[05:53] <Keyseir> I already looked at prefered/default applications
[05:53] <me|ong> a few of my programs have that.. but i want to remove them entirely so i can install fresh
[05:53] <rukuartic> globe: Not quite sure how to shut down cups server, but I know how to shut off cups completely :P just remove its start up in the system>administration>services or /etc/rc*.d
[05:54] <globe> rukuartic: well, that would work except that it drives my printer ;-)
[05:54] <v3rmap> Hi, I shared my home directory on Ubuntu Dapper, using SMB. (Open Nautilus, right click & select "Share Folder"). When I try to access the Ubuntu m/c from a Windows box (\\192.168.1.50), it pops up a password dialog. Despite my entering the correct username/password it still pops up that dialog again. Any suggestions?
[05:54] <rvalles> hi
[05:54] <rednaxel> ChocoCid, the "wobbling" windows thing is nice, but you don't move windows all the time
[05:54] <ChocoCid> yes
[05:54] <rvalles> root      3127  0.0  0.0   4880   568 ?        Ss   17:06   0:03 /bin/dd bs 1 if /proc/kmsg of /var/run/klogd/kmsg
[05:54] <gregben> rukuartic: here's what my /etc/hosts looks like. IP is assigned via dhcp by Linksys router. 127.0.0.1       localhost
[05:54] <gregben> 127.0.1.1       ubuntu01.san.rr.com     ubuntu01
[05:54] <rvalles> why dd and not just cat?
[05:54] <ChocoCid> there's also the ability to do things like hit f8 or whatever
[05:54] <rukuartic> globe: Haha... you might need to work on that by yourself, not a cups admin.
[05:54] <ChocoCid> (and pull everyhthing up)
[05:54] <rvalles> it looks like it must have lots of overhead, treating each byte as a "block".
[05:55] <rednaxel> but you change tasks often (using the cube, ctrl-alt-tab, mouse in the corner, etc)
[05:55] <ChocoCid> yeah
[05:55] <rukuartic> gregben: I might have interpreted your question wrongly...
[05:55] <Keyseir> ChocoCid, here's one thing I found "http://assente.altervista.org/it/use_thunar_as_default_gnome_file_manager/"
[05:55] <globe> rukuartic: no worries.  thx anyways
[05:55] <ChocoCid> Keyseir: in the future please don't quote stuff like that, it breaks the click-link functionality
[05:55] <rukuartic> gregben: If you add a line in the end of your file that says, fore xample, "192.168.1.20 ubuntusystem:
[05:55] <Keyseir> ChocoCid, oops. http://lxer.com/module/forums/t/22985/
[05:55] <rukuartic> gregben: whenever you do "ping ubuntusystem" it translates into "ping 192.168.1.20"
[05:56] <Keyseir> !ubotu gconf

[05:56] <catalytic_> hi all, im trying to install sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy nvidia-xconfig nvidia-settings
[05:56] <ChocoCid> gconf-editor
[05:56] <catalytic_> but i dont thinki have the right repos
[05:56] <catalytic_> what ones do i need to add, or how do i work this out for myself?
[05:57] <gregben> rukuartic: I pinged from a WinXP box. ping -a should come back with hostname but doesn't. Should I add a bogus ip address entry to /etc/hosts?
[05:57] <MaHaGoN> catalytic_, let me check to see if I have the package in the repos I have
[05:57] <catalytic_> thanks
[05:58] <gregben> rukuartic: Also, dhcp active ip table from Linksys shows ubuntu ip, but not hostname.
[05:58] <tokenbad> ok I have a question...I made my drives ext3 but want to go back to ntfs...but seems format program has trouble with it...is it possible to go from ext3 to ntfs?
[05:58] <catalytic_> its the xconfig that it cant find i think
[05:58] <rukuartic> gregben: Ur, I'm not quite sure how I could help you with that. If you want your winXP to be able to "ping ubuntuhost" you need to edit your windows based DNS records, or host a DNS on your linux box and have your WinXP box use that instead.
[05:58] <catalytic_> nvidia-xconfi
[05:58] <rukuartic> I need to go now people its midnight where I live. goodnight, good luck.
[05:58] <MaHaGoN> catalytic_ I have it.. all I did was go into /etc/apt/source.list and uncomment all the repos there
[05:58] <ChocoCid> no clue how to do that :\
[05:58] <ChocoCid> i guess you could follow the guide on the assente page
[05:58] <catalytic_> ok
[05:58] <Keyseir> ChocoCid, Maybe I'll just try going xfce
[05:59] <strabes> xfce is crazy fast
[05:59] <CITgu1> can anyone tell me how i can get tvtime to recognize my tv tuner card
[05:59] <MaHaGoN> well why not just go fluxbox if you want speed :-P
[05:59] <Keyseir> I just might if I can find a tutorial for setting it up
[06:00] <Keyseir> What should I do to completely install all the xfce things I need?
=== sgflmtreapt is now known as mikm[laptop] 
[06:00] <Keyseir> got a fairly fresh edgy isntall
[06:01] <MaHaGoN> do you want the xubuntu packages?
[06:01] <CITgu1> yup
[06:01] <MaHaGoN> because you could just do sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[06:01] <Keyseir> That sounds good.
[06:01] <ChocoCid> xubuntu-desktop will get it all
[06:02] <Duane> is setting up dns server hard?
[06:03] <crimsun> Duane: not really, but setting one up properly can be.
[06:03] <ChocoCid> heh
[06:03] <ChocoCid> like a lot of other things
[06:03] <ChocoCid> "it's easy to do, hard to do right"
[06:03] <Duane> I want to setup a webserver
[06:03] <Duane> and guessing I would need to setup dns as well
[06:03] <Duane> I have ubuntu server
[06:03] <Duane> with apache
[06:03] <Duane> php,mysql
[06:04] <catalytic_> it worked, thanks mahagon, why are they commented to begin with?
[06:04] <ChocoCid> ah, the classic LAMP setup
[06:04] <tokenbad> ok I have a question...I made my drives ext3 but want to go back to ntfs...but seems format program has trouble with it...is it possible to go from ext3 to ntfs?
[06:04] <Duane> yep ChocoCid
[06:04] <MaHaGoN> catalytic_, they contain certain packages that are illegal
[06:05] <ChocoCid> not illegal
[06:05] <MaHaGoN> catalytic_, or need further licescing
[06:05] <ChocoCid> non-free
[06:05] <ChocoCid> also he left
[06:05] <ChocoCid> ...and he's back!
[06:05] <wd> hey guys what's the faster wm for ubuntu? xfce or gnome?
[06:05] <ChocoCid> non-free packages
[06:05] <ChocoCid> wd: xcfe is faster
[06:05] <ChocoCid> *xfce
[06:05] <MaHaGoN> catalytic_, they contain certain packages that are.. well "non-free"
[06:05] <Duane> fluxbox
[06:05] <catalytic> nvidia drivers are working now, aweseome
[06:05] <catalytic> k
[06:05] <MaHaGoN> nice nice
[06:06] <wd> ChocoCid, hmmmm, everytime i install ubuntu i chose gnome but after i install easy ubuntu it gets slow.
[06:06] <ChocoCid> uh
[06:06] <ChocoCid> yeah

[06:06] <ChocoCid> for how to do it right
[06:07] <Nighthawke> need assistance in installing files from a tarball
[06:07] <wd> ChocoCid what do u  mean? do it right. is there a lite version?
[06:07] <ChocoCid> by "do it right" i mean do it through apt-get
[06:07] <kebert> Any ideas on how to bind the Windows key + D to Minimize to Desktop?
[06:07] <ChocoCid> sure, kebert
[06:07] <ChocoCid> system-preferences-keyboard shortcuts
[06:07] <MaHaGoN> :) Choco is on fire :-P
[06:07] <globe> exit
[06:07] <rednaxel> easyubuntu? I prefer Automatix
[06:07] <ChocoCid> this should get near everything, according to the wiki:   gstreamer0.10-pitfdll gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse gxine libxine-main1 libxine-extracodecs
[06:07] <cge> Surely there is some way I can keep EVMS from starting with a Dapper LiveCD without having to use init=/bin/bash?
[06:07] <at0m> irc.ArtificialIRC.com
[06:08] <ratacop> hola alguien habla espaol?
[06:08] <ChocoCid> with this to do dvd's...   gxine libxine-main1 libxine-extracodecs ogle ogle-gui
[06:08] <ChocoCid> !es
[06:08] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[06:08] <tokenbad> ok I have a question...I made my drives ext3 but want to go back to ntfs...but seems format program has trouble with it...is it possible to go from ext3 to ntfs?
[06:08] <ChocoCid> rednaxel:
[06:08] <ChocoCid> !automatix
[06:08] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[06:08] <kebert> ChocoCid, it won't let my bind the windows key to two different commands
[06:08] <wd> ChocoCid i tried xfce but my right click feature keeps disappearing on me.
[06:08] <MaHaGoN> I have said a couple times... automatix has yet to steer me wrong yet.. and no don't pull the works for me garbage choco :-P
[06:08] <ChocoCid> uh, odd
[06:08] <strabes> people in here don't like automatix but i've never had a problem
[06:08] <wd> Duane and fluxbox wont run with nautilus.
[06:08] <rednaxel> ChocoCid, afaik automatix2 is far better
[06:08] <ChocoCid> MaHaGoN: my dapper system got hosed by automatix
[06:08] <ChocoCid> well, hosed in part
[06:08] <MaHaGoN> ChocoCid: what about automatix2
[06:09] <rednaxel> I got my share of problems with automatix
[06:09] <rednaxel> but automatix2 is getting better
[06:09] <wd> MaHaGoN forget automatix.....
[06:09] <cge> MaHaGoN, automatix 2 still is unsafe though
[06:09] <ChocoCid> why would i use automatix2 when i can do "sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-pitfdll gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse gxine libxine-main1 libxine-extracodecs"?
[06:09] <wd> MaHaGoN i had major probs
[06:09] <ChocoCid> anyway
[06:09] <Keyseir> The external hd I had connected isn't even showing up in /dev after my last reboot. Is there a command I can use to see what's connect and where it's located? It's a usb device
[06:09] <MaHaGoN> wd really? what happened?
[06:09] <wd> MaHaGoN crashed and burn twice.
[06:09] <Nighthawke> i downloaded LM sensors,. both tarballs and extracted them to my desktop, now how can i install them?
[06:10] <cge> Is there any way to keep the Dapper LiveCD from touching any SCSI drives?
[06:10] <MaHaGoN> wd, I am not saying you should use automatix for everything, just somethings its easier to get with that, like firefox plugins for instance
[06:10] <wd> ChocoCid what do u use? xfce, gnome, kde?
[06:10] <ChocoCid> gnome
[06:10] <ChocoCid> but i have a very modern system
[06:10] <ChocoCid> laptop bought last year
[06:10] <emilia> hello, i am new to ubuntu, and i would like to know how i can add my monitor so i can change my screen resolution to something higher than 1024x768
[06:10] <jumassillia> extract tarball tar -x lll.tar
[06:10] <bimberi_> cge: The Ubuntu Live CDs don't open hard drives unless you make them do so
[06:10] <ChocoCid> so speed isn't much of an issue for me
[06:10] <cge> bimberi_, no, I mean, it can't be touched at all.
[06:10] <ChocoCid> !fixres
[06:10] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[06:11] <ChocoCid> there you go, emilia
[06:11] <cge> bimberi_, EVMS does touch them, but it doesn't mount them.
[06:11] <emilia> ChocoCid: Thanks!
[06:11] <Duane> sudo apt-get install bind?
[06:11] <Duane> for dns
[06:11] <bimberi_> cge: i don't know then sorry, apart from disconnection
[06:11] <ChocoCid> !bind
[06:11] <ubotu> bind: Internet Domain Name Server. In component universe, is extra. Version 1:8.4.6-1 (edgy), package size 888 kB, installed size 2092 kB
[06:11] <Nighthawke> had gunfights with my intel IGP chipset until i restarted the live CD in safe mode
[06:11] <ChocoCid> looks like it...
[06:11] <cge> bimberi_, Even if the system tries to read the partition table on the (nonexistent) hard drive, it will cause a kernel panic.
[06:11] <bimberi_> !bind9
[06:11] <ubotu> bind9: Internet Domain Name Server. In component main, is optional. Version 1:9.3.2-2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 292 kB, installed size 724 kB
[06:11] <Nighthawke> gave up on it for i could not install to a USB drive
[06:12] <ChocoCid> uh
[06:12] <bimberi_> cge: what partition table? on a live cd? won't hae the hdds on it
[06:12] <bimberi_> *have
[06:12] <ChocoCid> installing ubuntu on a USB drive seems odd
[06:12] <ChocoCid> i think you want a knoppix variant for that
[06:12] <MaHaGoN> but then again, when I recommend automatix I don't have any systems I couldn't bring back from complete destruction in less than 2 hours so :-/  My risk is pretty low in using
[06:12] <Duane> bind9 is already the newest version.
[06:12] <Duane> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[06:12] <wd> ChocoCid hmmm, i always end up with gnome, the old faithful.....lol    i tried xfce but my righ click feature kept disappearing, fluxbox was nice but nautilus didn't play right, had to dl thunar, tried gentoo, forget that compiling everything, so now back to gnome but sluggish
[06:12] <ChocoCid> MaHaGoN: yeah, that's a fairly important factor
[06:12] <Nighthawke> it is. especially when i dont have a spare 2.5 drive laying around
[06:13] <ChocoCid> for the record i used easyubuntu on my parents' computer.. really wish i hadn't now, as it will make more fiddly crap i don't know about later most likely =\
[06:13] <cge> bimberi_, I'm not sure. All I know is that the kernel is detecting four SATA drives and using SCSI emulation. There is only one (IDE) hard drive in the laptop. It panics when starting EVMS, but if I use myself as init (init=/bin/bash) I can mount the hard drive. Of course, Windows locks up as well, so I'm guessing that something is seriously wrong with the motherboard.
[06:13] <tokenbad> ok I have a question...I made my drives ext3 but want to go back to ntfs...but seems format program has trouble with it...is it possible to go from ext3 to ntfs?
[06:13] <ChocoCid> tokenbad: yeah
[06:13] <wd> ChocoCid read ^^^^^^^
[06:13] <MaHaGoN> Wow, is it really almost 12:15, I have school in the morning :-/
[06:13] <ChocoCid> you may have to delete the thing
[06:14] <ChocoCid> as in delete the partition entirely then repartition it
[06:14] <ChocoCid> i don't think you can simply go ext3>ntfs
[06:14] <bimberi_> cge: hmmk :/
[06:14] <MaHaGoN> well, farewell guys gl in all your ubuntu endeavors
[06:14] <tokenbad> ok is there a program that will do that...that can use from a bootable cd?
[06:14] <ChocoCid> try ext3>wiped out>ntfs
[06:14] <ChocoCid> tokenbad: the ubuntu livedisc can
[06:14] <ChocoCid> with gparted
[06:14] <wd> ChocoCid i tried that dual boot with two hds, grub still screwed me up.
[06:14] <ChocoCid> ew
[06:14] <bimberi_> Duane: then you have it installed
[06:14] <ChocoCid> dunno how grub works on 2 hard drives =\
[06:14] <tokenbad> ok so go to livecd then synaptic gparted?
[06:14] <ChocoCid> grub works fine for me on dualboot now
[06:14] <ChocoCid> tokenbad: don't need synaptic
[06:15] <ChocoCid> just alt-f2 gparted
[06:15] <Duane> bimberi_ that mean it just works I am guessing no
[06:15] <tokenbad> ok thanks...will try it...
[06:15] <Nighthawke> ok now how can i install LM sensors from the tarball
[06:15] <ChocoCid> it's built into the livecd since that's what it uses to partition for the installer
[06:15] <wd> ChocoCid yeah with single hd, right?  yeah it works fine , but i don't like wrtiing to my wndows mbr.
[06:15] <ChocoCid> heh
[06:15] <GigaClon> I have a problem with firefox, when there is a long page some times when i click a link instead of following the link, it jumps back to the top of the page
[06:15] <ChocoCid> grub doesn't overwrite the windows mbr
[06:15] <emilia> i have right clicked on a folder on my other computer, and clicked share, does anyone know how i can see it from this computer? both are ubuntu. when i go to network places it says windows network?
[06:15] <emilia> but id ont have windows anywhere
[06:15] <at0m> is there a taskmanager for linux?
[06:15] <ChocoCid> at0m: yes
[06:16] <ChocoCid> gnome-task-manager
[06:16] <ChocoCid> er
[06:16] <at0m> built in or have to get?
[06:16] <ChocoCid> gnome-system-monitor
[06:16] <ChocoCid> built in on ubuntu
[06:16] <bimberi_> Duane: System -> Help -> System Documentation, Server Guide, Networking, Domain Name Service.  Even though it should say bind9 instead of bind it has information on setting it up
[06:16] <ChocoCid> i put a shortcut on my taskbar
[06:16] <ChocoCid> also, ps -e combined with kill (and killall) do the same thing from terminal
[06:17] <wd> ChocoCid ok , why when i delete ubuntu partition, to run windows i got grub error, so i had to fdisk /mbr to get windows mbr to recognize.
[06:17] <ChocoCid> just remember that kill kills by process ID #'s, killall kills by name
[06:17] <Duane> bimberi_ I dont have windows X I have server installed so command line
[06:17] <ChocoCid> wd: because if you just deleted it, your system is still looking for grub on boot most likely
[06:17] <jumassillia> or kill -9 PID
[06:17] <at0m> edgy seems really sluggish on my nvidia 6600 compared to dapper
[06:17] <ChocoCid> kill -9 is overkill :P
[06:17] <bimberi> Duane: ah. righto, sec...
[06:17] <jumassillia> didnt know that i alays use it though ..
[06:17] <ChocoCid> well
[06:17] <wd> ChocoCid ok so what's the best way to kill grub on single hd dual booting if u want to uninstall ubuntu?
[06:17] <me|ong> rm -r /
[06:18] <me|ong> :D
[06:18] <ChocoCid> kill gives the program a chance to clear stuff up
[06:18] <at0m> anyone else find edgy to be more sluggish?
[06:18] <Duane> im installing fluxbox bimberi
[06:18] <ChocoCid> kill -9 is "screw you, yoiu're dead"
[06:18] <me|ong> wd
[06:18] <ChocoCid> "you don't even get to write your will"
[06:18] <me|ong> if you want windows on it
[06:18] <jumassillia> so kill -9 NO Good ?
[06:18] <me|ong> just fdisk /mbr
[06:18] <ChocoCid> kill -9 is last resort
[06:18] <me|ong> or a fir mbr
[06:18] <me|ong> err
[06:18] <me|ong> fix mbr
[06:18] <ChocoCid> in other words, use it when kill doesn't work
[06:18] <jumassillia> and first resort would be ?
[06:18] <ChocoCid> kill
[06:18] <iter> or if you're lazy
[06:18] <bimberi> Duane: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/dns.html
[06:18] <jumassillia> ok , kill + PID right ?
[06:18] <ChocoCid> linuxcommand.org has details
[06:19] <jumassillia> :-)
[06:19] <ChocoCid> sigkill vs sigterm
[06:19] <at0m> democracy tv player is terrible
[06:19] <Duane> ty
[06:19] <me|ong> i think there's a tutorial on grub somewhere on google
[06:19] <Duane> bimberi you think fluxbox is good
[06:19] <me|ong> i foudn it a while back was very good
[06:19] <ChocoCid> !grub
[06:19] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:19] <ChocoCid> :)
[06:19] <me|ong> hehe
[06:19] <me|ong> touch
[06:20] <me|ong> ugh this damn e-mail server is pissing me off
[06:20] <bimberi> Duane: don't use it.  Someone whose opinion I respect does though and thinks its great.
[06:20] <me|ong> i think i got pop workign cuz i can check for mail
[06:20] <me|ong> but i can't send e-mails to it
[06:20] <Kaiyang> Hurray Ubuntu!!!
[06:20] <Duane> ok seems good for a server since I like gui but not resource greedy
[06:20] <jumassillia> Newbie question .. I used to do it but coming back to linux slowly  .. (How to create q session ? )
[06:20] <ChocoCid> on a server why would you use a GUI at all? :(
[06:20] <ChocoCid> q session?
[06:21] <ChocoCid> what's a q?
[06:21] <jumassillia> a session sorry
[06:21] <me|ong> ChocoCid i agree
[06:21] <me|ong> i've been setting mine all up wiht gui
[06:21] <me|ong> OH
[06:21] <me|ong> and FYI
[06:21] <ChocoCid> er... you mean a terminal session?
[06:21] <jumassillia> yes
[06:21] <me|ong> i figured out how to FULLY remove
[06:21] <wd> mejong yes but sometimes that doesn't work.....   well , i tried the two hd install. i change jumper on winxp to slave then disco, put ubuntu on primary master, edit grub menu.lst, wrote in windows title, (hd0,0) (hd1,0) blah blah blah, still screwed me, win won't boot. so i just pulled ubuntu hd out and stuck with win.
[06:21] <ChocoCid> applications-accessories-terminal
[06:21] <me|ong> it's dpkg --purge <package name>
[06:21] <me|ong> ;)
[06:21] <ChocoCid> i set mine up in keyboard shortcuts to use control-alt-super
[06:21] <ChocoCid> now there's a 3-fingered salute you can learn to love :D
[06:21] <jumassillia> Nope .. I mean its like a ctrl or Alt F5 / something like that ..
[06:21] <ChocoCid> alt-f2?
[06:22] <jumassillia> To create a terminal session
[06:22] <ChocoCid> not really a terminal, but you can launch commands
[06:22] <me|ong> wd
[06:22] <iter> jumassillia: alt-f2
[06:22] <me|ong> what are you trygin to do again?
[06:22] <me|ong> i came into the convo a bit late
[06:22] <iter> jumassillia: from gnome ctrl-alt-f2
[06:22] <ChocoCid> and
[06:22] <jumassillia> I try
[06:22] <ChocoCid> this is why you don't go alt-fkeys
[06:22] <ChocoCid> whoa
[06:22] <me|ong> you're trying to get ubuntu and windows to boot together?
[06:23] <ChocoCid> jumassillia you can switch to console with control-alt-f1 through 6, with f7 bringing you back to the GUI
[06:23] <specialbuddy> is there a way to connect to itunes with linux?
[06:23] <ChocoCid> !itunes
[06:23] <ubotu> itunes is not available on Linux, but there are many audio player alternatives (see !players). For Daap clients (sharing music with other iTunes clients on the network), install banshee
[06:23] <ChocoCid> !players
[06:23] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[06:23] <ChocoCid> there you go
[06:23] <ChocoCid> :P
[06:23] <jumassillia> It worked :-) thqnks how is thqt called to do that  ??
[06:23] <me|ong> XMMS!!!!
[06:23] <me|ong> WOOOO
[06:23] <iter> jumassillia: those are called "virtual terminals"
[06:23] <me|ong> VLC for video :)
[06:23] <ChocoCid> you're at a 10, we need you at about a 7
[06:23] <bimberi> um, none of those connect to iTunes though
[06:23] <specialbuddy> I haven't been able to get any of those to work
[06:23] <wd> mejong, ok, basically i really want to install ubuntu on a second hd, that way i dont interfere with win mbr, in case i want to uninstall ubuntu. i tried the ubunt on primary and win on slave thing, edit grub menu, still screwed me.
[06:23] <me|ong> heh
[06:23] <jumassillia> Iter thqnks , slowly comming back to linux
[06:24] <jumassillia> thanks sorry
[06:24] <me|ong> wd
[06:24] <me|ong> create a boot floppy
[06:24] <me|ong> or
[06:24] <ChocoCid> linuxcommand.org is awesome btw
[06:24] <me|ong> install lilo
[06:24] <iter> jumassillia: qny time ;)
[06:24] <me|ong> !lilo
[06:24] <ubotu> lilo is an alternative [Li] nux Boot[Lo] ader. Note: it is recommended that you use GRUB on Ubuntu instead.
[06:24] <me|ong> :D
[06:24] <me|ong> pfft
[06:24] <me|ong> lilo = for noobs
[06:24] <ChocoCid> eh
[06:24] <specialbuddy> I wonder why we can't connect to itunes yet
[06:24] <jumassillia> iter , Im trying to do cool easy stuff to start with my linux box .. would shell be a good idea ?
[06:25] <me|ong> noobs need lilo till they get used to linux installs
[06:25] <me|ong> ;)
[06:25] <|thunder> jumassillia; get beryl working
[06:25] <ChocoCid> you're in #ubuntu and you're talking about noobs?
[06:25] <Duane> configure: error: Fluxbox requires the X Window System libraries and headers.
[06:25] <wileyb> Hi I'm new to chat- hope I'm not butting in,   -I'm having a problem with the mplayer plugin - won't play video anymore after I got flashplayer9. --- thanks
[06:25] <ChocoCid> ubuntu is supposedly the most noob-friendly linux distro
[06:25] <Duane> to get those is it sudo apt-get X11?
[06:25] <me|ong> lol
[06:25] <ChocoCid> so... ;\
[06:25] <iter> jumassillia: I generally use gnome-terminal from inside gnome
[06:25] <me|ong> i'd say somewhat
[06:25] <me|ong> but when dealign wiht dual booting etc..
[06:25] <Duane> sudo apt-get install X-11
[06:25] <me|ong> specially with windows.. you gotta have a clue about mbr etc..
[06:25] <wd> mejong,  really?
[06:25] <jumassillia> beryl .. ok i google it .. :-)
[06:26] <me|ong> wd my rule of thumb is.. if you want linux to work with windows
[06:26] <|thunder> jumassillia; beryl-project.org
[06:26] <iter> jumassillia: http://www.beryl-project.org/
[06:26] <me|ong> isntall windows on a hdd first
[06:26] <ChocoCid> beryl is amazing :D
[06:26] <me|ong> THEN install linux after and itl take care of everything
[06:26] <Duane> ??
[06:26] <Duane> anyone
[06:26] <iter> mousewheel near edge of screen is the best
[06:26] <ChocoCid> me|ong speaks the truth!
[06:26] <jumassillia> beryl , a ok , its like compiz right ?
[06:26] <ChocoCid> yeah
[06:26] <ChocoCid> it's a fork actually
[06:27] <kebertxela> Are there any articles on pre-compiled vs. compiled kernel performance?
[06:27] <me|ong> if you expect to format windows though
[06:27] <itclanster> hi guys
[06:27] <me|ong> i'd suggest lilo for the boot loader
[06:27] <ChocoCid> i've never used lilo actually
[06:27] <ChocoCid> :\
[06:27] <me|ong> because it's failry straight forward to rebuild
[06:27] <wd> mejong, i've done that, just didn't really want to install grub in win mbr, because i had a hard time fix mbr last few times.
[06:27] <me|ong> you won't have to with lilo
[06:27] <Duane> configure: error: Fluxbox requires the X Window System libraries and headers.
[06:27] <me|ong> it doesnt' touch mbr
[06:27] <Duane> what apt-get pkg?
[06:27] <wd> mejong is it realiable?
[06:28] <me|ong> yes
[06:28] <me|ong> and you can create a boot floppy ro rebuild it at anytime
[06:28] <itclanster> apt-get is not that releiable
[06:28] <ChocoCid> ...wtf?
[06:28] <CPrgmSwR2> I need some help.. I am tring to use gentoo's grub boot loader to load kubuntu
[06:28] <CPrgmSwR2> but for some reason a get kernel panics
[06:28] <itclanster> sometimes it just kick ur system off
[06:28] <ChocoCid> yeah not surprised, CPrgmSwR2
[06:28] <ChocoCid> seriously
[06:28] <me|ong> grub is for people who have familiarities with boot loaders and mbr
[06:28] <me|ong> ;)
[06:28] <ChocoCid> just let ubuntu install its own grub
[06:28] <Duane> anyone?
[06:29] <ChocoCid> !anyone
[06:29] <Duane> please
[06:29] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[06:29] <CPrgmSwR2> I didn't something even more screwed up
[06:29] <iter> !apt
[06:29] <ubotu> apt is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto  -  Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[06:29] <ChocoCid> ubuntu's grub will detect gentoo on your system
[06:29] <CPrgmSwR2> I used my gentoo kernel to boot kubuntu
[06:29] <me|ong> CPrgmSwR2
[06:29] <ChocoCid> and set up automagically
[06:29] <ChocoCid> ...wtf?
[06:29] <me|ong> read up on how to congirue grub
[06:29] <ChocoCid> partitions.
[06:29] <feles> hello all
[06:29] <ChocoCid> seriously.
[06:29] <ChocoCid> partitions.
[06:29] <jumassillia> iter , why beryl to start with ? challenging thats why ?
[06:29] <me|ong> it loads images.. so you'll have to know the specifics of what to setup
[06:29] <CPrgmSwR2> I know my partions very well
[06:29] <me|ong> yeah
[06:29] <ChocoCid> just stick ubuntu on another partition
[06:29] <me|ong> but whenyou see the grub conf
[06:30] <me|ong> you'll understand why i said it lol
[06:30] <feles> I have a question, is there a client for Ubuntu that is good for connecting to different WAP's?
[06:30] <iter> jumassillia: it's good to show off to friends/coworkers
[06:30] <ChocoCid> !wap
[06:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:30] <ChocoCid> :(
[06:30] <ChocoCid> !wifi
[06:30] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:30] <iter> feles: have you tried wifi-radar ?
[06:30] <CPrgmSwR2> I almost think that the kernel is not compiled right for kubuntu to work
[06:30] <Duane> there an apt command to install the x window system
[06:30] <me|ong> um
[06:30] <me|ong> WAP?
[06:30] <ChocoCid> uh yeah
[06:30] <jumassillia> iter .. i see hard to install / set up you think ?
[06:30] <ChocoCid> it's a modular kernel...
[06:30] <me|ong> that's not a technology...
[06:30] <me|ong> WEP, WPA, WPA2
[06:30] <AWOSLappy> Okay I'm having a problem with Audacity and Flash.  When one is using the sound card the other can't.  e.g. if I bring Audacity up, then Flash can't play sound.  If I bring Flash up, then Audacity can't open the driver.
[06:30] <me|ong> ;)
[06:30] <AWOSLappy> I am using Flash 7.
[06:30] <g_wark> hiyall
[06:30] <feles> iter, no
[06:30] <iter> jumassillia: if you're on edgy with aiglx it's quite easy
[06:30] <AWOSLappy> inside Firefox 1.5 and Audacity 1.4.2.
[06:30] <wd> ChocoCid i used grub, i just didn't like that fact that when i deleted ubuntu partition and rebooted i got grub error, ok i tried fix mbr, had probs, so i had to install win over.... sometimes fix mbr doesn't always work, just trying to install grub but not on win mbr. that's my thing.
[06:31] <iter> jumassillia: but a lot of people seem to have trouble with it
[06:31] <jordo23> I have a dual boot system with a secondary HD that is formatted into FAT32 to share with windows. How do I install this to Ubuntu to show in KDE?
[06:31] <g_wark> are there many folks who use ubuntu on laptops ?
[06:31] <me|ong> wd
[06:31] <me|ong> fdisk /mbr
[06:31] <ChocoCid> i am, g_wark
[06:31] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: yes, this is correct. Caused by them both using the old style sound drier (which exclusively locks the sound device)
[06:31] <me|ong> and i try to avoid isntalling linux on the same machien as windows
[06:31] <me|ong> there's ALWAYS a conflict
[06:31] <CPrgmSwR2> yeah its like the kubuntu doesn't work well with an outside grub loader
[06:31] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: The fix is to not use both at the same time.
[06:31] <ChocoCid> heh
[06:31] <g_wark> cheers ChocoCid
[06:31] <wd> me|ong ok, lol
[06:31] <ChocoCid> me|ong  i ahve a perfectly fine dual boot setup
[06:32] <ChocoCid> the problems i have are either hardware problems (damn you broadcom) or generic "windows is suck" problems
[06:32] <jumassillia> iter , i see , no problem .. Are you in Canada  too ?
[06:32] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, but I need to use both.  Is there an update for either?  would the Flash 9 beta work?
[06:32] <wd> ChocoCid yeah i did too, until i wanted to delete ubuntu.
[06:32] <me|ong> you don't play with formating and removign etc.. though i'm guessing :P
[06:32] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: I doubt it, but you can try...
[06:32] <ChocoCid> why would i WANT to?
[06:32] <g_wark> my instalations of all ubuntu versions hang out and die at the video resolution screen
[06:32] <me|ong> lol
[06:32] <ChocoCid> both setups work (for careful definitions of "work" on windows)
[06:32] <me|ong> when you liek to screw aroudn with things
[06:32] <wileyb> yes, g_wark,  I have it on an old pII 300mhz compaq armarda
[06:32] <ChocoCid> i screw around with things plenty!
[06:32] <ChocoCid> that's why my dapper got hosed lol
[06:32] <me|ong> heh
[06:33] <ChocoCid> automatix, easyubuntu, manual editing of multiple config files... yeah ;[
[06:33] <feles> ok, installing wifi radar, thank you iter
[06:33] <ChocoCid> eventually x.org broke and i just installed edgy
[06:33] <ChocoCid> i figure i'll break edgy just in time to use feisty beta
[06:33] <me|ong> i have mine on gui.. so i'm in no rush to upgrade :P
[06:33] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, is there another recorder in Ubuntu that can record from the mixer like Audacity can?
[06:33] <wd> ChocoCid , me|ong  i installed 64 bit edgy and man, lots of things don't work, i installed breezy and things r ok, but dapper 64 won't nstall, how do u rate it?
[06:33] <me|ong> the gui doesn't change enough for me to care
[06:33] <ChocoCid> don't use 64
[06:34] <me|ong> ChocoCid
[06:34] <me|ong> wtf
[06:34] <me|ong> 64 is the shit
[06:34] <|thunder> wileyb; hey me too, compaw armada 110 laptop
[06:34] <wd> ChocoCid what?
[06:34] <ChocoCid> i don't use 64 because i don't have an amd64?
[06:34] <|thunder> wileyb; hows it do with edgy ?
[06:34] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: Oh, you're trying to record from flash?
[06:34] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, Yes.
[06:34] <wd> me|ong, i guess u use 64?
[06:34] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: sound recorder perhaps... dunno...
[06:34] <me|ong> yes
[06:34] <Admiral_Chicago> can anpone help me with this "debconf: DbDriver "config": /var/cache/debconf/config.dat is locked by another process" error
[06:34] <lando__> can anyone help me with xrandr and an ati video card? ati propietary drivers are installed.
[06:34] <wd> me|ong dapper?
[06:34] <Bonez56> hi all, i have a fresh edgy install. when i use the VNC server that is built into Gnome, every time I reboot it corupts my password. all of the details stay there, but I can no longer VNC to my PC as it says invalid pass. Anyone else seen this?
[06:34] <me|ong> but my server isnt.. i'm waiting to upgrade my OS to 64 but i need a new machien to do that
[06:34] <me|ong> :S
[06:34] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, um, Sound Recorder?  I see nothing to the likes of that in the Multimedia menu.
[06:35] <wileyb> I don't have edgy yet, just dapper 1.06--- the hardest thing to get working was the sound and dial up.
[06:35] <jordo23>  I have a dual boot system with a secondary HD that is formatted into FAT32 to share with windows. How do I install this to Ubuntu to show in KDE?
[06:35] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: I have a `gnome-sound-recorder'
[06:35] <wd> me|ong, 64 dapper is ok huh?
[06:35] <me|ong> havn't had a chance to try
[06:35] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, Ahhh okay.  I will go apt-get it :)
=== Raven is now known as Xorlev
[06:35] <cafuego> wd: For a desktop box, you're best off running 32bit even on a 64bit cpu.
[06:36] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, E: Couldn't find package gnome-sound-recorder
[06:36] <n_i_c_k> Admiral_Chicago: you could try "lsof" which I think has options to show you which process has the file open.
[06:36] <wd> cafuego i was told i won't see diff in speed any way?
[06:36] <me|ong> you won't yet
[06:36] <me|ong> vista comes out this monht
[06:36] <wd> me|ong  damnb.
[06:36] <ChocoCid> the 32 bit stuff just "works" better
[06:36] <me|ong> and you can expect to see 64bit start comming out huge
[06:36] <cafuego> wd: this is correct. but lots of stuff (java/flash/video) works on 32bit and not on 64bit.
[06:36] <ChocoCid> ding ding ding
[06:37] <cafuego> wd: mainly because they're all more or less proprietary and their creators can't or won't support 64bit (yet).
[06:37] <me|ong> most anti virus programs have 64bit ones launching when vista comes out.. and a few other programs too
[06:37] <wd> cafuego  thats why i unstalled ubuntu,   wine, codecs lot of things just didn't work.
[06:37] <gursikh> .
[06:37] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: in `gnome-media' on Edgy.
=== gursikh is now known as khalsa
[06:38] <jumassillia> iter , just a question , where are you now ?
[06:38] <wd> me|ong, cafuego, so should i install dapper 32 or edgy 32?
[06:38] <iter> jumassillia: california
[06:38] <cafuego> wd: I use edgy32, works fine.
[06:39] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, Kubuntu 6.06 LTS.
[06:39] <wd> cafuego for amd 64?
[06:39] <jumassillia> Cool :-) I was there few summer ago ..
[06:39] <cafuego> wd: yup
[06:39] <wd> iter, what part?
[06:39] <cafuego> AWOSLappy: sound-recorder - Direct-to-disk recording and play-back programs.
[06:39] <honk> If only programmers would comment their code!
[06:39] <iter> wd: la
[06:40] <wileyb> oops I men't dapper 6.06
[06:40] <cafuego> /* this code may look odd, but works fine */
[06:40] <wd> cafuego  ok, i was thinking about dapper because it's been out and worked on, edhy still in the mix.....
[06:40] <ChocoCid> edgy's released
[06:40] <ChocoCid> it's fine by me, but whatever
[06:40] <wd> iter, just moved form la to lancaster....lol
[06:40] <ChocoCid> i've had no problems with it since the beta
[06:40] <gumpish> man, it sucks using ppc... no flash =p
[06:40] <cafuego> wd: Edgy is okay, as long as you do a fresh install (the upgrade process is um, somewhat flaky...)
[06:40] <AWOSLappy> cafuego, okay I'm getting it.
[06:40] <feles> can anyone tell me how to disable the touchpad in ubuntu?
[06:40] <wd> cafuego ok
[06:40] <CharlieSu> How can I tell if the Nvidia module has loaded? it is changed in xorg.conf but i don't see the bootsplash and the NoLogo option isn't set..
[06:40] <tamacracker> I think I asked this question a few months ago, and I don't know if it was answered lol.. But is there such thing as a disc clean up or defragmenter?
[06:40] <jumassillia> :-) I lived on Hollywood blvd for 3 months behind the metro station ..
[06:41] <cafuego> CharlieSu: if X started, it's loaded.
[06:41] <CharlieSu> cafuego: how come the boot splash didn't load?
[06:41] <CharlieSu> cafuego: the big white screen with the nvidia logo
[06:41] <wd> cafuego, me|ong, man it just seems that after i install some apps ubuntu get damn slow. even with 64bit.
[06:41] <feles> brb
[06:41] <cafuego> CharlieSu: maybe they've become sane and disabled it by default
[06:42] <CharlieSu> cafuego: also, nvidia-glx-config enable didn't work
[06:42] <n_i_c_k> feles: comment it out of your xorg.conf, I think
[06:42] <me|ong> wd
[06:42] <me|ong> what apps
[06:42] <khalsa> Hello: Thanks allready to those here who have helped me. Linux Newbie (disclaimer) Ubuntu Up and running fine, installed PCI wireless adapter (D-Link DWL-G520 vb.2) and it worked just fine once I installed network-monitor to connect to my WPA wireless network. There is only one issue: While downloading a file, or playing a game (yaay tremulous) every 120 seconds or so it will completely time out for no apparent reason. The 120 seconds
[06:43] <tamacracker> Is there a tool such as defragmenter or disc clean up on Ubuntu?
[06:43] <jordo23> How do I mount a secondary HD (fat32) in ubuntu?
[06:43] <cafuego> tamacracker: There is no need for defragmentation (ext2 isn't broken like FAT32 or NTFS)
[06:43] <cafuego> tamacracker: cleanup wise, depends on what you want to clean up. users ruff or system stuff...
[06:44] <wd> Merijn ok, i installed easy ubuntu and checked everything i needed, pretty much, everything. and it crawled after that.
[06:44] <Duane> ssh the best remote admin option?
[06:44] <Duane> to view gui too
[06:44] <tamacracker> cafuego what is meant by the term "broken"?
[06:44] <at0m> whats the equivelant command for ipconfig in linux?
[06:44] <cafuego> tamacracker: they fragment over time
[06:44] <me|ong> you can view GUI with SSH?
[06:44] <Duane> ifconfig
[06:44] <me|ong> never heard of that...
[06:44] <CharlieSu> cafuego: are you 100% sure?? is there not another way to tell?
[06:44] <Duane> iwconfig
[06:45] <cafuego> tamacracker: it's not horribly hard to not make them do that (certainly not to the xtent ntfs/fat32 do)
[06:45] <cafuego> CharlieSu: 'lsmod | grep nvidia' will show you.
[06:45] <CharlieSu> ya i did that
[06:45] <CharlieSu> it is there
[06:45] <Duane> I though you could me |ong
[06:45] <cafuego> well then
[06:45] <wd> me|ong  after i installed  easyubuntu it crawled
[06:45] <tamacracker> i see....  i just wanna make sure my machine's tidy :D
[06:45] <|thunder> at0m; ifconfig
[06:45] <CharlieSu> cafuego: but so is nvidia_agp which was there before I did anything
[06:45] <digivore> does anyone know if there is a newer version to the at76c505a wireless driver?
[06:45] <cafuego> tamacracker: have a perv at debfoster, deborphan.. :-)
[06:45] <jumassillia> atOm try ifconfig
[06:46] <cafuego> tamacracker: due to the way stuff is packaged; when you remove a package, ALL files it came with are removed.
[06:46] <feles> ... >.> Hello again
[06:46] <tamacracker> oh good... that's what i want to make sure
[06:46] <khalsa> was my last message too large to be received ?
[06:46] <feles> So how do you disable the touchpad again?
[06:47] <tamacracker> <cafuego> also what keeps me thinkin is, when I delete files, and it doesn't go into my trash can... i wonder where it then goes from there.
[06:47] <cafuego> tamacracker: On occasion you have leftover config files ("dpkg -l | grep ^rc" will show you)
[06:47] <cafuego> tamacracker: "Delete" removes them outright.
[06:47] <tamacracker> sweet
[06:47] <tamacracker> yes ill just click it and hit the DEL key :D
[06:48] <cafuego> Note: there is no undo on a delete.
[06:48] <feles> As well as who has some tips on setting up a share in ubuntu so a windows computer can see it?
[06:48] <wd> me|ong, cafuego, i just can't believe that people use linux only, man it's mind blowing, i dual booted for a while, but microsoft have me glued, damn apps...lol.... i know ur going to say "linux have can do better".. but i need my cell phone app, photoshp..etc
[06:48] <cafuego> wd: Gimp is as good as photoshop, you just need to get used to it (I did, you can too ;-)
[06:48] <qwerty> yeah it just takes time
[06:49] <wd> cafuego  no way...lol
[06:49] <tamacracker> wd i have photoshop on my ubuntu right now :D
[06:49] <cafuego> wd: really
[06:49] <qwerty> wine runz pscs2 ? :D
[06:49] <wd> tamacracker   really, oh i know with wine huh?
[06:49] <wd> tamacracker yeah do it?
[06:49] <tamacracker> Cross does
[06:49] <cafuego> wd: The UI is quite different and frustrating when you don't know it off by heart.. but after running gimp for a year and not using photoshop during that time, having to suddenly use photoshop is ANNOYING.
[06:49] <wd> tamacracker ok what' the diff between cross and wine?
[06:50] <tamacracker> Cross over you actually have to pay for
[06:50] <wd> cafuego    ooooo my gosh, really?
[06:50] <tamacracker> unless you're slick as i am
[06:50] <cafuego> Photoshop too, and a lot more.
[06:50] <qwerty> lol
=== qwerty is now known as Qwerty
[06:50] <cafuego> wd: Yeah, I was yelling at it the other day coz it didn't work like Gimp ;-)
[06:50] <wd> cafuego  lol
[06:51] <cafuego> it'
[06:51] <cafuego> s just a matter of being used to it
[06:51] <tamacracker> I just like photoshop more, more filters, and less work to create images
[06:51] <tamacracker> GIMP has a long way before it touches photoshop's plugins
[06:51] <cafuego> create images? that's what cameras are for
[06:51] <wd> cafuego well, i just dl cs2 and studio 8 ,  can u beat that with linux..... ( i love linux, just not enough apps)  lol
[06:52] <tamacracker> linux + photoshop > windows + photoshop :D
[06:52] <cafuego> wd: Gimp, vim.
[06:52] <wd> cafuego    lol
[06:52] <cafuego> Free, open. Not breaking laws when using them. much faster.
[06:52] <wd> tamacracker  lol
[06:52] <wd> cafuego  ok u win.
[06:53] <RancidLM> hey all.. could some one recommend a good instant messaging client for linux..? i like AMSN but find its a resource hog at times
[06:53] <jumassillia> ircname = juju
[06:53] <cafuego> Oh, and me+vim = standards compliant xhtml ;-)
[06:53] <tamacracker> GAIM
[06:53] <tamacracker> GAIM's beautiful
[06:53] <RancidLM> tamacracker: iv tried game but it doesn't have all the msn features that amsn has thats the holy downfall
[06:53] <wd> cafuego so r u dual booting now?
[06:53] <bimberi> RancidLM: gaim, although that's the first time i've heard it called 'beautiful'
[06:53] <bimberi> :)
[06:54] <tamacracker> did you try lookin for plug ins
[06:54] <RancidLM> :)
[06:54] <tamacracker> GAIM compared to AIM destroys AIM.
[06:54] <cafuego> wd: In theory yes. In practice i run Linux 100% of the time and haven't used Windows for ages. (except to convert that broken EPS last week)
[06:54] <RancidLM> tamacracker: no i did not im gonna go look into plugins
[06:54] <tamacracker> :D
[06:55] <cafuego> wd: Mind you, I could've done that via vmware, but needed to reboot anyway.
[06:55] <tamacracker> All you gotta do is tweak GAIM
[06:55] <wd> cafuego, tamacracker    ok i dont see to many people representing us ubuntu users....  lynucs.org    (my dream site)
[06:55] <orkid> join #ubuntu-devel

[06:58] <wd> Duane not me
[06:58] <Staz> isn't that a fencing game?
[06:58] <jordo23> jumassillia: Is VLC the codec package or a program?
[06:58] <Duane> http://www.engardelinux.org/modules/index/index.cgi
[06:58] <crimsun> vlc is a program.
[06:58] <jumassillia> great program , trust me
[06:58] <compudaze> jordo23: vlc is a great all around media player, plays mostly everything without need to download extra codecs
[06:58] <wd> crimsun long time.
[06:58] <Staz> heh so not a fencing game then
[06:59] <jordo23> will install both....thanks
[06:59] <wd> crimsun i'm back trying this linux thing again, u know me.....  lol
[06:59] <jumassillia> any ideas on how to change the ircname ?

[07:00] <jair> hello guys, here is a guys comming from Debian :) and testing ubuntu for first time.
[07:00] <compudaze> welcome
[07:00] <wd> cafuego  still there or  r u drooooling like i've been the last 2 years on lynucs.org?  lol
[07:00] <jumassillia> the ircname from the whois command in irssi
[07:00] <jair> I have a quick question, the CD I download is a live cd and also the installer cd?
[07:00] <jair> I download the 6.10
[07:01] <jair> let me check
[07:01] <Flannel> jair: yes.  the liveCD has an installer on it.
[07:01] <compudaze> jumassillia: try /set real_name whatever you want here
[07:01] <RancidLM> im having a problem un-locking a package.. using synaptic is there a way to unlock  a version in the console?
[07:01] <compudaze> and then /save
[07:01] <jumassillia> :-) i try
[07:01] <compudaze> then reconnect to see the change
[07:01] <Flannel> jair: or, rather, the "desktop" CD, the "Alternate" CD is JUST an installer, without a live environment (textmode installer)
[07:01] <tamacracker> Wd
[07:01] <jair> Flannel: and it is any problem with me enabling the user root on the architecture of the system?
[07:01] <tamacracker> do you want to install photoshop onto your linux?
[07:01] <Flannel> jair: no problem no, but there's no reason to
[07:01] <tamacracker> it even runs faster and smoother on linux
[07:01] <nalioth> !tell jair about root
[07:01] <tamacracker> which is funny
[07:01] <jair> Flannel: why not?
[07:01] <jumassillia> lynucs.org .. not bad
[07:02] <wd> nalioth  hey long time....lol
[07:02] <Flannel> jair: because ubuntu is set up to not use a root account
[07:02] <wd> tamacracker yes , faster?
[07:02] <nalioth> wd: i'm always here.
[07:02] <jair> Flannel: I mean, I want to understand the benefit of the sudo.
[07:02] <wd> nalioth  no for me...lol
[07:02] <tamacracker> it seems like it's faster on ubuntu
[07:02] <Flannel> jair: read the link ubotu just sent you, it explains it pretty well
[07:02] <jumassillia> sudo = superuser :-0
[07:02] <tamacracker> and doesn't eat up as much resources
[07:02] <jair> Flannel: but then who is the root on the system?
[07:02] <noiesmo> tamacracker, thats using wine i take it also what version of photoshop out curisosity
[07:02] <tamacracker> crossover office
[07:03] <wd> tamacracker darn it, ur going to make me leave windows for sure this time....lol
[07:03] <noiesmo> tamacracker, aah ok
[07:03] <Flannel> jair: there is no "user" who is root, the root login is disabled, there is technically a 'root' account, because linux requires it (for file ownership, etc), but it's never used
[07:03] <tamacracker> oh trust me
[07:03] <tamacracker> between games
[07:03] <tamacracker> and the programs i use on windows
[07:03] <tamacracker> i have all of them installed
[07:03] <jair> thanks ubotu
[07:03] <tamacracker> im almost at the point of gettin rid of windows for ever :D
[07:03] <jair> Flannel: hmmm ok
[07:03] <wd> tamacracker  i thought crossover office was for offfice....duh.
[07:03] <jordo23> nevermind....got it....
[07:04] <tamacracker> nah it uses a really stable wine
[07:04] <wd> tamacracker really?
[07:04] <jair> and how long will last this release ? 6.10?
[07:04] <Born_In_Xixax> hi, having a strange problem with network.  by setting a static IP, i can ping my default gateway, and i can resolve and ping yahoo.com; however no other network services seem to work: i.e. http, telnet, irc, etc..? help!
[07:04] <crimsun> jair: what do you mean by "last"?
[07:04] <jumassillia> tamacracker waow
[07:04] <Born_In_Xixax> this installation worked fine for weeks until today...even last night
[07:04] <wd> tamacracker  so ur dual booting now?
[07:04] <Flannel> jair: each release is supported for eightteen months, but another will be out every six (7.04 is the next release), Dapper will be supported for three years, because it's a LTS (Long Term Support)
[07:04] <tamacracker> yeah... but i might just get rid of windows xp in all
[07:05] <jair> crimsun: because the only reason I do not use ubuntu is because of the (to much gui going on) and also the change quickly of releases.
[07:05] <wd> tamacracker  ur bold. i getting my courage build up day by day lol
[07:05] <Flannel> jair: I have no GUI on this system
[07:05] <jumassillia> tamacracker how long did you spent on li**x ?
[07:05] <jair> Flannel: ok
[07:05] <tamacracker> plus viruses and adware and pop ups and spyware tend to find my PC when im in windows...
[07:05] <caveMan1> in ubuntu is there a quicker way to set default application file browser uses than setting each extension one by one? for example to open video files with VLC I'd have to click on each video type and set it manually, instead of just typing in the extensions VLC should open by default
[07:05] <wd> tamacracker  i feel like a junkie, windows has me!.....  lol
[07:05] <what_if> I cannot install ubuntu due to corrupted graphics during install. Tried 6.10 amd64 and Alt-install amd-64 . any ideas ??
[07:05] <jair> Flannel: so basically I should go with Dapper then instead of 6.10
[07:05] <tamacracker> i've only been using it for 4 months
[07:05] <tamacracker> don't worry
[07:05] <tamacracker> once you get used to linux
[07:05] <tamacracker> you'll start to use linux more than windows
[07:06] <jumassillia> same herre but still ..
[07:06] <Flannel> jair: if you want to not reinstall quickly, yeah.  Dapper is your best bet
[07:06] <tamacracker> then when you get your hands on crossover office... you're never gonna go on windows
[07:06] <Flannel> jair: or soon rather, and even then, youve got 18 months
[07:06] <tom47> what-if is it essential that you use 64?
[07:06] <tamacracker> then one day out of boredom, you'll most likely delete windows lol
[07:06] <compudaze> caveMan1: right click on the file, choose properties, goto open with, click the dot on which program u want as default, click ok
[07:06] <Flannel> what_if: grab the alternate CD, install in textmode, then you can fiddle with graphics on an installed system
[07:06] <what_if> tom47: not really, does the i386 version work ??
[07:06] <tom47> yes and works better overall
[07:06] <wd> tamacracker,   well this time i bought a hp all in one printer and while i was at the store i went online to see if hp had linux drivers and it does so i'll be ok.  lol
[07:07] <jumassillia> tamacracker , true but few apps still not 100% compatible .. ;-(
[07:07] <jair> Flannel: but the things is that i like to work in a system that does not chage to quickly, and that is stable.  That is why i always has been using stable Debian sarge
[07:07] <what_if> Flannel: I refuse to use an OS that step 1 after installing it is fixing it
[07:07] <tamacracker> i dunno I've installed a lot of programs
[07:07] <caveMan1> compengi, yes that's what I'm doing now. I'm asking if there's a faster way to set this for multiple extensions
[07:07] <tom47> what_if yes ..... there are very few reasons to use 64 and many reasons not to
[07:07] <tamacracker> and they're all working normally right now
[07:07] <jumassillia> MusicBrainz?
[07:07] <BrightEyes`> damn it!!! i tried to install enlightment and it took off kde and many other data as well as adept.what can i do?
[07:07] <wd> tamacracker     my lexmark didn't play well with ubuntu  6 mnths ago.
[07:07] <what_if> tom47: allright, will give the 386 version a shot :)
[07:08] <defrysk> lexmark does not like windows
[07:08] <BrightEyes`> sorry.i tried to uninstalla dept
[07:08] <defrysk> lexmark is evil
[07:08] <tamacracker> lexmark hates windows
[07:08] <BrightEyes`> i hate windows as well
[07:08] <jair> Flannel: so i will go ahead and download the Dapper one.  Forget about 6.10
[07:08] <Flannel> jair: then Dapper is probably what you want.  It'll be supported for three years, and by the time it's out of support, there will be another LTS.  So you can keep going on a three year cycle or so.  Or at least, that's the plan.  I believe the LTS releases will overlap by a year or so.  I'm not an expert though
[07:08] <defrysk> windows = linux ;p
[07:08] <wd> tamacracker i tried trillian with wine it was ok kindof buggy last year.
[07:08] <jumassillia> tamacracker did you try to install musicbrainz ?
[07:08] <bony> i am unable to play vcds in totem? i installed totem-xine it plays dvds with menus and even normal dvds too, but not vcds i have to depend on mplayer to play vcds. In any player the quality of the video is very bad its bright and contrast i tried to adjust the brightness and contrast but i couldn't get the correct settings.
[07:08] <tamacracker> lol i had lexmark printers, then finally went to HP
[07:08] <wd> defrysk yeah i know.
[07:08] <tamacracker> music brainz?
[07:08] <Flannel> jair: yeah, that's what I would recommend.  And, you might as well download the alternate CD, instead of the desktop. It'll boot you straight into an installer
=== RobNyc_ is now known as robnyc[] 
[07:08] <jair> Flannel: nice thank you for clarify this
[07:08] <tamacracker> uh... Bearshare even works with cross over office.
[07:09] <jumassillia> tamacracker yep a mp3 tagger super efficient
[07:09] <tamacracker> but then I found nicotine, and im satisfied with that.
[07:09] <jair> Flannel: what do you mean?
[07:09] <what_if> tom47: would you recommend dapper over edgy ??
[07:09] <specialbuddy> how do I connect to a mac?
[07:09] <jair> Flannel: Dapper have two cds?
[07:09] <defrysk> for long term use dapper
[07:09] <jair> Flannel: have two installers
[07:09] <tamacracker> the only thing that's keepin me to windows
[07:09] <tamacracker> is the MP3 player.
[07:09] <Flannel> jair: theres two versions, of all.  A Desktop CD (live CD, with liveCD installer), and an Alternate CD (Just the textmode installer).
[07:09] <wd> tamacracker  ok here's the question......   single hd dual partition?
[07:09] <jumassillia> which one?
[07:09] <snadge-w> can someone point me to information on edgy's new startup scripts.. like a FAQ or a HOWTO of how they work now?
[07:09] <jair> defrysk: thanks that is what i am planning
[07:09] <tamacracker> there's no installation files for linux
[07:10] <compudaze> that mp3 player do you use that's so great?
[07:10] <crimsun> snadge-w: http://upstart.ubuntu.com
[07:10] <tamacracker> nah I have two 200 GB HDs
[07:10] <defrysk> jair, for txt install get alternative , for lightweight get xubuntu
[07:10] <jair> Flannel: but I can install using text with the live cd version as well?
[07:10] <tamacracker> one for ubuntu and one for windows
[07:10] <what_if> will new software be backported to dapper or will i have to use edgy to get new software
[07:10] <caveMan1> is there any different between kubuntu and ubuntu apart from the fact that ubuntu is using GNOME by default and kubuntu KDE?
=== dk0r is now known as dk0r_
[07:10] <Flannel> jair: no. the liveCD only has ubiquity (the liveCD installer)
[07:10] <what_if> caveMan1: no
[07:10] <tamacracker> Toshiba F10 MP3 Player
[07:10] <jair> ohhh ok
[07:10] <specialbuddy> how come I can't connect to my friends mac through the network
[07:11] <snadge-w> crimsun: i have a problem with dnsmasq failing to start in edgy.. if i start it manually with /etc/init.d/dnsmasq start.. its fine, but for some reason i have to manually start it on bootup
[07:11] <jumassillia> tamacracker i see .. so what to do then ?
[07:11] <Flannel> jair: so if you download the liveCD, you have to wait for the liveCD to boot, then start the install, etc.  Which, is good if you're looking to try out the distro with the liveCD, not too good if you just want to install
[07:11] <what_if> caveMan1: you can install ubuntu and apt-get kde and you now have kubuntu, oh and the boot screen will be different
[07:11] <compudaze> snadge-w: does it give en error on startup?
[07:11] <jair> where is the link for the alternate cds, I need the text-like installer of the ubuntu, there is any difference between the xubuntu and ubuntu both Dapper Drake?
[07:11] <tamacracker> I gotta call up Toshiba and find out if they're ever gonna produce linux installation files :D
[07:11] <defrysk> xubuntu installs xfce4 iso gnome
[07:11] <Flannel> jair: Xubuntu will install Xubuntu, Ubuntuw ill install Ubuntu (Xfce and Gnome, respectively)
[07:12] <snadge-w> no error messages.. no startup messages at all actually.. it just boots straight into gdm pretty much
[07:12] <wd> tamacracker   wait, i just caught hell trying that install, had to write the grub menu.lst and all, still screwed me and i followed wiki to the tee..... :(   . i just dont' want to touch my win mbr, just in cast i uninstall ubuntu, i want to be able to just unplug ubuntu hd and keep rolling......
[07:12] <compudaze> but it doesn't start?
[07:12] <jair> Flannel: I see but both of them will be Dapper drake then?
[07:12] <defrysk> kubuntu installs kde
[07:12] <jumassillia> alright people good night gotta sleep
[07:12] <compudaze> is it set to run on startup?
[07:12] <wd> tamacracker   if crossover is all that maybe not.
[07:12] <wd> tamacracker  lol
[07:12] <Flannel> jair: Alternate CDs are on the same page... you might have to go to "more options", nope.  no more options needed for Dapper.  Just download the Alternate instead of DEsktop.
[07:12] <ademan> anyone know how the gnome-applet for weather gets its info?
[07:12] <jair> Flannel: all right so what i will like to get is the (Dapper Drake xubuntu installer cd)
[07:12] <snadge-w> compudaze: im not sure.. i used to know how the init scripts worked when they were SysV style
[07:12] <tamacracker> i dunno i like crossover :D
[07:13] <tamacracker> i just got it last night
[07:13] <Flannel> jair: Yes, Xubuntu and Ubuntu are both in all versions, jsut different desktop environments
[07:13] <shwag> so I just got a new video card. How do I tell ubuntu to reconfigure my X11 settings and check for the new video card ?
[07:13] <crimsun> snadge-w: probably https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/dnsmasq/+bug/47438 ?
[07:13] <jair> Flannel: let me go to the site then, Flannel you were great, :)
[07:13] <tom47> tamacracker ... the free version?
[07:13] <ademan> snadge-w: well i believe right now upstart is working in "system-v compat mode" so basically it works the same way
[07:13] <wd> tamacracker ok  so did ur dual hd install write grub to win mbr?
[07:13] <jair> thank you very much
[07:13] <tamacracker> the pro version
[07:13] <tamacracker> but for free yes :D
=== dk0r_ is now known as dk0r
[07:13] <jair> I will go check for those versions
[07:13] <crimsun> snadge-w: unless it's not creating /var/run/foo properly ?
[07:13] <defrysk> shwag, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:14] <tamacracker> wd naw, i have two HDs one for linux and one for windows
[07:14] <Flannel> tamacracker: You need to have grub installed on whichever your BIOS boots to though, unless you want to tweak your BIOS each time you want to switch
[07:15] <tom47> tamacracker the 60 day trial?
[07:15] <shwag> defrysk: is there an 'auto' mode so it doesnt ask me all these questions ?
[07:15] <tamacracker> i forgot what command i used in the terminal that automatically created my grub to work with windows xp
[07:15] <wd> tamacracker  yes but grub installed where? if u uninstall ubuntu, delete partition, if u reboot u'll get grub error, so how would u avoid that,,, besides fixmbr?
[07:15] <wd> tamacracker oh?
[07:15] <Flannel> tamacracker: grub overwrites the windows MBR, which then allows you to boot into whichever you'd like
[07:15] <tamacracker> rom47 no man... i have the pro version, but i found where to get it for free :D
[07:15] <tom47> oic
[07:15] <Flannel> tamacracker: ah, sorry.  you don't need my banter ;)
[07:15] <defrysk> shwag, run the defaults and check if the card is recognized
[07:15] <wd> Flannel  but i'm trying to avoid that. i even edit my grub menu list and still got screwed.
[07:16] <what_if> tom47: ok... downloading x86 version of edgy (hangs head)
[07:16] <specialbuddy> how do I make it so that if someone wants to see my shared files they don't have to enter a username and password
[07:16] <snadge-w> crimsun: i dont think its a segfault problem.. it just doesnt start.. i cant see anything in the logs about crashing
[07:16] <wd> Flannel i got title to boot into win, but error .
[07:16] <porongo> Werdnum, you have  a problem?
[07:16] <Flannel> wd: What?  Trying to avoid what?  not needing a /boot partition?
[07:16] <caveMan1> I spent almost a day to finally get xgl working on my machine, will I likely have to do that all over again if I try KDE?
[07:16] <Werdnum> yes, channel-wide versioning.
[07:16] <noiesmo> specialbuddy, you need to edit /etc/smb.conf
[07:16] <tom47> what_if i have an amd 3500+ and use the 386
[07:16] <what_if> tom47: you know, right now I am using gen2 @ 64bit with no problems
[07:17] <porongo> Werdnum, its allowed, so fuck off
[07:17] <wd> Flannel   no. trying to avoid writting grub into windows mbr on dual boot with 2 hd
[07:17] <noiesmo> specialbuddy, find the line that reads security = user and change it to share instead of user
[07:17] <Flannel> !language  | porongo
[07:17] <ubotu> porongo: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[07:17] <specialbuddy> noiesmo, is there a way to connect to them?
[07:17] <noiesmo> specialbuddy, then restart smaba
[07:17] <porongo> !language | Flannel
[07:17] <ubotu> Flannel: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[07:17] <jair> Flannel: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/6.06.1/release.1/ got it :)
[07:17] <jair> ubotu: thank you also for your help
[07:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thank you also for your help - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:17] <tom47> what_if o my way of thinking the reason I go this way is the relative degree of testing of the two version ie the user base
[07:17] <crimsun> snadge-w: probably the /var/run issue, then
[07:17] <Werdnum> thank you, DBO
[07:17] <shwag> defrysk: this is lame...its asking like 40 questions.
[07:17] <tamacracker> <,< i wanna be able to tweak my modem
[07:18] <DBO> Werdnum, yep =)
[07:18] <what_if> tom47: agreed,
[07:18] <jair> haha ubotu is a bot :)
[07:18] <Werdnum> DBO: I propose a !stfu
[07:18] <Flannel> wd: Thats difficult, because windows MBR doesn't know how to boot anything but windows.  You could swap your HDs boot order in BIOS, boot into grub, then whenever you want to delete windows, you'd have to switch your BIOS back
[07:18] <what_if> tom47: there isn't _really_ any 64 bit software anyways, aside from americas army and povray
[07:19] <Flannel> !stfu | Werdnum
[07:19] <ubotu> Werdnum: Words like noob, jfgi, stfu or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
[07:19] <Werdnum> dude, GRUB can boot into windows.
[07:19] <tom47> what_if and i could never find a case for the 64 version
[07:19] <defrysk> shwag, just hit <enter> for each question and check if the video-module is correctly probed
[07:19] <vnobien> Please help me: Edgy + aiglx + compiz + Radeon Mobility M7
[07:19] <tom47> what_if thats so
[07:19] <what_if> tom47: (bragging rights)
[07:19] <tom47> hehehehe
[07:19] <Werdnum> Flannel: sneaky, although RTFM and JFGI should be okay.
[07:19] <Werdnum> stfu and noob are just harsh.
[07:20] <what_if> tom47: I've got a dual core 64-bit processor running at 64 bits.. What Now... HUH ?
[07:20] <defrysk> shwag, usually the defaults are correct anyway
[07:20] <Flannel> Werdnum: no they shouldnt.  This is not an elistist channel. Go elsewhere if you want to belittle people
[07:20] <DBO> Werdnum, no no, they are not ok, we like to be more newbie friendly than that =)\
[07:20] <what_if> tom47: lol
[07:20] <tonyyarusso> vnobien: #ubuntu-xgl
[07:20] <snadge-w> crimsun: whats the /var/run issue? :)
[07:20] <Werdnum> Flannel, DBO: Not as in the literal meaning, as in the
[07:20] <vnobien>  tonyyarusso, thks
[07:20] <specialbuddy> is there a reason I can't see my friends windows computer on my network?
[07:20] <Werdnum> "search the web before you ask here" sense
[07:20] <wd> Flannel,   i want to dual boot with two hd, ubuntu on hd master and windowsxp on slave, i read to unplug win hd, install ubuntu hd as master, edit grub menu.lst, title winxp etc.... shut down, install win hd (slave) should get menu on reboot. i did but error loading.....i just want to dual boot and not touch win mbr.
[07:20] <crimsun> snadge-w: /var/run needs to be created on tmpfs, possibly
[07:21] <Flannel> wd: That's fine.  You can dualboot without touching te MBR, however, why are you trying to not touch the MBR?
[07:21] <DBO> Werdnum, we have found in the past that using those acronyms in here can have very negative effects, please try to type out what you mean if you think they need to google first =)  but really, just asking is fair enough.  Anyhow we are off topic, if you wish to discuss more you are free to ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:21] <tamacracker> guys?
[07:22] <Werdnum> DBO: I see.
[07:22] <tamacracker> I have a really important question
[07:22] <tom47> to you?
[07:22] <tamacracker> Does anyone know how to "thumb" open windows/applications?
[07:22] <Flannel> !ask | tamacracker
[07:22] <ubotu> tamacracker: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:22] <wd> Flannel because i had a bad experiance with linux, so i deleted partition, on reboot i got grub error, couldn't start windowsxp. after reinstall, i learned to use fix /mbr  or fdisk /mbr, which sometimes didn't work, just want to keep security blanket..
[07:23] <specialbuddy> can someone help me out with networking to a windows computer?
[07:23] <tom47> wd security blankets are one ting ... the'windows-as-a-virus" is probably anything but :D
[07:23] <Flannel> wd: right.  So, the problem there was grub was looking for /boot, fair enough.  However, the problem with what you're proposing as a solution is the only way you'll get to boot windows after you delete linux, is by swapping the HDs back
[07:23] <kuja> !samba | specialbuddy
[07:23] <ubotu> specialbuddy: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:24] <Piquant77> Hey guys I have a prolem, I can't unshare a directory in Edgy Eft
[07:24] <specialbuddy> thanks
[07:24] <specialbuddy> what about macs though?
[07:25] <kuja> specialbuddy: No idea
[07:25] <wd> Flannel i understand, i want to swap the hd back, if i encounter problems with linux again, however when i swapped hd back grub still somehow installed on my win mbr.
[07:26] <wd> Flannel   still using two hd.
[07:26] <kuja> That's normal.
[07:27] <wd> Flannel  i guess i'm saying somethng went wrong after i edit grub menu.lst
[07:27] <kuja> When GRUB is installed, it'll install on the first partition of the first harddrive, IIRC, by default.
[07:27] <wd> kuja, i made ubuntu my master and winxp as slave.
[07:27] <Flannel> wd: grub will install on your primary.  What you'll do is swap so linux is primary, windows is secondary, and install.  It'll all install, and... should be good from there.  If you can't use windows by the default setup you'll need to tweak your GRUB a bit, it's pretty easy. to make windows think it's on primary master, simple two lines in grub, if you hae problems.

[07:28] <kuja> I've had bad experiences using Windows as a secondary :)
=== lando__ is now known as lando
[07:29] <wd> Flannel   yes. i did that grun menu.lst   editing and still ran into problems... i know ur talking about the title  windowsxp, (hd0,0) (hd1,0)  etc....  on reboot i got the title screen but wouldn't load windows... so i chose load up ubuntu.
[07:30] <defrysk> kuja, bad experiences with windows ?
[07:30] <wd> Flannel  oops grub menu .lst
[07:30] <kuja> defrysk: And that
[07:30] <defrysk> good experiences with windows anyone ?
[07:30] <bony> is it possible to open pagemaker 6.5 files in scribus?

[07:30] <kuja> Windows is on the second?
[07:30] <wd> yes
[07:31] <wd> kuja i followed forum instruction

[07:31] <squidly> hello there.. I have a quick question what kernel should I use to get my smp support?
[07:31] <kuja> wd: That means for GRUB, Windows is recognized as (hd1,0)

[07:31] <squidly> defrysk, thanks
[07:32] <specialbuddy> i don't remember ubuntu sucking so much on networking
[07:32] <Corporal_Dirge> Anyone have issues with Nautilus crashing when trying to make an icon for shockwave files?
[07:32] <Flannel> wd: er, nothing about title.  it's the 'map' command
[07:32] <tom47> !smp
[07:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:32] <kuja> specialbuddy: I've never had a problem I couldn't handle.
[07:32] <tom47> hmm
[07:32] <Squee> !linux-686-smp
[07:32] <baconbacon> kuja, Flannel, theres "map" for these master/secondary issues
[07:32] <ubotu> linux-686-smp: Obsoleted by: linux-image-generic. In component restricted, is optional. Version 2.6.17.10 (edgy), package size 23 kB, installed size 52 kB
[07:32] <Squee> ?
[07:32] <Flannel> squidly: the kernels already have smp in them.  You using dapper or edgy?
[07:32] <noiesmo> specialbuddy, did you edit the smb.conf file as i suggested
[07:32] <Flannel> baconbacon: that's what I just said.
[07:32] <squidly> dapper
[07:32] <specialbuddy> I just remember it working from the begining with other versions of Ubuntu
[07:32] <wd> Flannel yes i did that map....etc   i was talking about the first line is title...... windowsxp
[07:32] <baconbacon> oh
[07:32] <defrysk> Squee, as I said , generic ;)
[07:32] <squidly> edgy would not work properly
[07:33] <Flannel> wd: right, title makes absolutely no difference, it's just the title on the grub menu.
[07:33] <wd> Flannel thanks.
[07:33] <squidly> edgy would take up 90% of my ram and load slower then windoze
[07:33] <Flannel> squidly: linux-image-[whatever]  is what you want.  k7, 686, etc.  They;ve already got smp in them

[07:35] <daWabbit> Hello, everyone
[07:35] <wd> Flannel i'm saying i folowed the forum to the tee and ran into prob so i unpluged ubuntu hd, but windows wouldn't boot, i got grub error, so i did fix /mbr which didn't work, then i did the fdisk /mbr which worked. i'm saying i wanted to avoid all this and still had to do it......lol   thats all.
[07:36] <tom47> !ask | daWabbit
[07:36] <ubotu> daWabbit: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:36] <wd> Flannel  scared next time fdisk /mbr may not work
[07:36] <iter> psh
[07:36] <daWabbit> Dual boot is a PITA. I quit doing it long ago. Hell, I have to keep a Windows machine, but I don't even connect it to the LAN
[07:36] <iter> it will work
[07:36] <iter> that's what it does
[07:36] <kuja> I let my BIOS let me select what I want to boot, seemed to work better for me.
[07:36] <iter> there's nothing mystical about the mbr
[07:36] <squidly> ok brb
[07:37] <Flannel> wd: I have no idea what forum thread youre talking about.  And, If you got a grub error, I imagine the forums howto is wrong.
[07:37] <wd> kuja i read that in forum ,   prob was every body don't have bios option.  what part in bios could i find that option?
[07:37] <delaney> Is anyone aware of why the date and time option in the system menu is no longer working on an edgy xubuntu system running xfce 4.4 RC2  i get the following when attempting to run it in console
[07:37] <wd> Flannel  uh oh  it was ours.
[07:37] <delaney> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[07:37] <kuja> wd: Boot order
[07:38] <crimsun> delaney: did you compile it yourself?
[07:38] <kuja> wd: However, for my particular setup, I just press F9 at boot, and it'll give me a popup menu of what I want to boot. If I select "Harddrive", it'll ask me which harddrive I want to boot.
[07:38] <delaney> crimsun, i used the graphic installer
[07:38] <Flannel> wd: right, that still doesn't mean it's correct.  Or that it's the only one.  Just install ubuntu like normal, with your linux partition as the primary master, and windows as the slave.  Then come back here if you still have troubles
[07:38] <daWabbit> delaney; I think it is looking for Gnome. Not sure what to edit. If you build it, it will work, or at least it has here
[07:39] <delaney> daWabbit, its not the same date and time option as gnome gnome-system-tools package handles that while in xubuntu xubuntu-system-tools seems to contain Date and Time
[07:39] <Vaske_Car> what does mean compile?
[07:39] <delaney> daWabbit, it has always worked before until recently.. ive never had problems till today
[07:39] <wd> kuja  ok so ur saying , unplug winxp hd ( which is master) set jumper to slave. install ubuntu on master. go into bios and chose primary master to boot?
[07:39] <wd> Flannel  sure
[07:39] <Flannel> wd: no, move it on the cable.
[07:40] <Rede> im having some difficulty setting up my dual monitors with nvidia. video displays fine in the console, but in X there is an orange tinge and a vertical black line down the left side of the second display... anyone had any similar issues?
[07:40] <delaney> crimsun, do u figure it might be because of RC2 .. ive yet to find someone running edgy with rc2 who might confirm
[07:40] <kuja> You know what the best way is that worked for me, to dual boot?
[07:40] <daWabbit> delaney; I've just had a bit of a problem with it in XUbuntu dapper and Ubuntu dapper for PPC. Building it stops the problems
[07:40] <crimsun> delaney: I'm running RC2 and cannot confirm your symptom.
[07:40] <wd> Flannel move winxp to cable?
[07:40] <kuja> Keep Windows on the master, install Windows. Install Ubuntu (let GRUB overwrite Windows' loader).
[07:40] <kuja> This has *always* worked for me and never failed.
[07:40] <delaney> crimsun, you are saying yours works fine.. and u also used the graphical installer?
[07:40] <Flannel> wd: BIOS will already be set to primary master to boot.  Don't worry about changing anything in the BIOS.  Swap the harddrives, so linux is the master, windows is the slave, and install.
[07:40] <Qwerty> what's the next version gonna be called?
[07:41] <daWabbit> Something Fawn
[07:41] <Squee> fiesty
[07:41] <Qwerty> oh ok
[07:41] <Qwerty> Fiesty Fawn
[07:41] <Qwerty> ?
[07:41] <Squee> yep
[07:41] <daWabbit> Thanks, Squee
[07:41] <kuja> yeah
[07:41] <Squee> np
[07:41] <wd> Flannel and linux won't install grub to windows (slave) just on ubuntu (master) right?
[07:41] <daWabbit> I just read it and I couldn't recall it. Must be the medicines
[07:41] <dorto> Next it will be GobbledeGook
[07:41] <Qwerty> one thing, why are most linux stuff named after animals, geckos particularly
[07:41] <Squee> i'm skipping edgy and waiting for fiesty, edgy is too unstable >_<
[07:42] <Qwerty> when's fiesty happening?
[07:42] <dorto> gentoo, slackware, fedora, suse, debian...how many of these are names of animals?
[07:42] <Flannel> wd: right, it'll install grub to the pimary master, linux.  And from GRUB you'll be able to boot to windows or grub.  Although, I'm pretty sure it'll install correct, but it might need a bit of tweaking for the grub menu to boot windows, come back here if you do have troubles.
[07:42] <daWabbit> Qwerty; No telling. Trying to make sense of Open Source naming conventions is a sure ticket to the loony bin. Or back to Windows
[07:42] <Flannel> Qwerty: every six months.  7.04
[07:43] <Qwerty> daWabbit, yeah lol
[07:43] <Qwerty> Flannel, ok
[07:43] <daWabbit> :)
[07:43] <Qwerty> dorto, lol, some logos are, like Mozilla, suse, ubuntu names
[07:44] <Flannel> Qwerty: ubuntu names are only code names.  The names once they're official are year.month.
[07:44] <Qwerty> oh yeah :)
[07:45] <wd> Flannel  ok.   if it will install grub on primary master being linux, and not touch winxp mbr being slave, i should be ok.  it's just strange that i did it that way and grub ended up on my winxp partition.
[07:45] <jordo23> IS there a howto on installing flash plugin for Konq?
[07:45] <jordo23> Nevermind
[07:45] <wd> Flannel  which meant i had to do the fix /mbr anyway....
[07:45] <Flannel> wd: make sure you swap them on the cable, and the jumpers (although, why aren't you using cable select? unless your HD/MB is ancient)
[07:45] <Qwerty> the mozilla plugin would do that I thinks
[07:46] <Flannel> wd: and, if it did install there, then what it means is you hadn't actually moved windows drive to be the slave.
[07:46] <Qwerty> I personally dont like Konq more than Fx, more than IE, yes!
[07:46] <wd> Flannel which one goes on cable select?
[07:46] <Flannel> wd: They both do, if you have an EIDE cable
[07:47] <AdamKili> how do i link the command ruby1.8 to ruby?
[07:47] <AdamKili> the command ruby1.8 works but a program wants the command ruby
[07:47] <AdamKili> so i need to link it i guess
[07:47] <rickyfingers_> adam: u could just make sim link
[07:47] <dorto> konqueror is good if someone wants a single interface for everything: file manager, web browser, ftp etc
[07:48] <dorto> gmail like web sites do not work well in konqueror
[07:48] <AdamKili> how? i'm still relatively new to linux, but learning a lot
[07:48] <Qwerty> yeah, as a file manager etc its good, but as a browser it aint :(
[07:48] <timfrost> AdamKili: sudo ln -s ruby1.8 /usr/bin/ruby
[07:48] <dorto> AdamKili, how did you install ruby? if you install apt-get install ruby, it will automatically create the links for you
[07:49] <AdamKili> dorto: i installed it through synaptic
[07:49] <dorto> AdamKili, in Synaptic, along with ruby1.8, also make sure that you mark 'ruby'
[07:50] <dorto> AdamKili, actually only selecting 'ruby' package is sufficient; it will automatically select ruby1.8(and other version in future)
[07:51] <Deedubb> Hello. I'm using an Nvidia RAID 0 and according to http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/utnubu-maintainers/2006-October/000327.html and the reply, this bug is marked as fixed. I however can't get the newer version - do I need to add a different repo?
[07:52] <Deedubb> I would like to add that this issue didn't exist on Drapper. which uses 0.9.9+1.0.0.rc9-2ubuntu1 of dmraid
[07:53] <wd> Flannel  yes i do have eide cable. so, set both hd jumpers to cable select. put the ubuntu hd 1st on the cable, winxp hd last on the cable. install ubuntu as usual. ur saying grub will install on ubuntu hd and not windows hd? and i will have a option to load winxp without editing grub menu.lst?
[07:54] <Shadowpillar> SUPER IMPORTANT TECHNICAL QUESTION
[07:54] <Shadowpillar> is it it possible to, without data loss, to resize my partitions?
[07:54] <nofxx> hey there.... this is really freakin' me out.... im with 6.06... when I try "dpkg-divert -divert /file..."  i get:   dpkg-divert unknown option '-divert'   ?? what is wrong????
[07:54] <Shadowpillar> :P
[07:54] <Shadowpillar> nodrop the -divert
[07:55] <Shadowpillar> er
[07:55] <Flannel> wd: Yes on the former, and ideally on the latter.  If not boot without editing, it's a quick edit.  And, "First" means the end of the cable, not the middle
[07:55] <Shadowpillar> nofxx: drop the -divert
[07:55] <Deedubb> Any advice for my raid problem guys?
[07:55] <Flannel> Shadowpillar: yes.
[07:55] <AdamKili> dorto: thanks a ton, and u to timfrost
[07:56] <BrightEyes`> how can i add a local user to use the x window manager?
[07:56] <Shadowpillar> Flannel: I plan on doing a dual boot, but I need to put another OS on my first partition
[07:56] <nofxx> Shadowpillar , i dont know what you mean... take it out ?
[07:56] <BrightEyes`> i can only log in as root.i have a user which now i cant get access to x server.what can i do
[07:56] <Qwerty> how do I run my own dns? I got an ADSL line, auto configured via DHCP
[07:56] <Deedubb> apt-get install bind
[07:56] <Flannel> Shadowpillar: first Harddrive, not first partition ;)  and yeah.
[07:56] <Qwerty> Deedubb, and after that?
[07:56] <BrightEyes`> i can only log in as root.i have a local user which now can't get access to x server.what can i do
[07:56] <Deedubb> man bind ?
[07:57] <Qwerty> ohk :P fine I'll rea that :D
[07:57] <Shadowpillar> Flannel: I plan on putting a stripped down windows XP on the first partition
[07:57] <Qwerty> my isp dns is slow
[07:57] <Shadowpillar> Flannel: and XP needs its own drive?
[07:57] <Deedubb> you can't just run your own DNS and take over the world. You can register a domain and get bind to answer (take authority) for that domain
[07:57] <Flannel> Shadowpillar: No, XP doesn't need it's own drive.  Partitions are not drives.
[07:57] <Shadowpillar> <Flannel> Shadowpillar: first Harddrive, not first partition ;)  and yeah.
[07:57] <Deedubb> you can set it up for caching DNS queries for faster DNS response times...
[07:58] <Qwerty> yeah it needs to cache
[07:58] <Flannel> Shadowpillar: you said "Need to put another OS on the first partition" you'd put it on a separate partition, not the same one
[07:58] <Qwerty> and then i'll take over the world :P
[07:58] <Shadowpillar> I usually know this stuff, but I forget what XP will do
[07:58] <Shadowpillar> Flannel: no, I meant that
[07:58] <kuja> For the record, XP will complain if all partitions on the first harddrive are formatted to anything other than FAT(32) and NTFS for me
[07:58] <Shadowpillar> Flannel: XP refuses to run unless it's on the first partition
[07:58] <Qwerty> atleast sites must reopen fast than 'looking up' appearing forever
[07:59] <Shadowpillar> Flannel: so I need to resize and copy my current fs
[07:59] <Shadowpillar> and edit some files
[07:59] <Shadowpillar> make sense?
[07:59] <Shadowpillar> is it possible?
[07:59] <Flannel> Shadowpillar: right.  Ah, gotcha.  yeah, any think (gparted) will be able to resize, you just need a liveCD, since you can't do it while mounted
[07:59] <Shadowpillar> yeah I know that
[07:59] <nofxx> Shadowpillar  xp dosent need to be on the first partition
[07:59] <Shadowpillar> nofxx: really?
[07:59] <kuja> Flannel: Can gparted resize without deleting everything?
[07:59] <nofxx> yup.. sure
[07:59] <tamacracker> Hey guys, how do I make my menu transparent?
[07:59] <Deedubb> Last call - advice for my RAID problem please guys, I've done the google step, I found a 'solution' now I just need to know how I get this solution on ubuntu
[07:59] <Flannel> kuja: yeah
[08:00] <kuja> Awesome.
[08:00] <nofxx> xp... older versions need
[08:00] <rickyfingers_> Shadow: www.inside-security.de/insert_en.html is a really good livecd for doing what u want
[08:00] <Shadowpillar> Flannel: can XP be installed on a secondary partition?
[08:00] <malt> ubuntu about the most easy to use linux os, that is good for being used as a web server?
[08:00] <malt> and ftp and more
[08:00] <Flannel> Deedubb: what's the question?
[08:00] <kuja> Flannel: What if I had several partitions? Can I merge them without losing data?
[08:00] <Flannel> Shadowpillar: no idea.
[08:00] <Flannel> kuja: Not that I'm aware of
[08:00] <kuja> Oh well :(
[08:00] <nofxx> Shadowpillar , what "nodrop" means? sorry.. english not my native language
[08:00] <philip> is there a way to make known users appear in the login window?

[08:01] <kuja> s/ll/lling/
[08:01] <Flannel> philip: go to the login screen setup, and there's a theme for that
[08:01] <Deedubb> Flannel http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/utnubu-maintainers/2006-October/000361.html says the bug I have is fixed in dmraid_1.0.0.rc13-1 which supposedly should be available to me, but it is not (I have done a apt-get update)
[08:01] <philip> ok thanks Flannel
[08:01] <Flannel> philip: or, an option, or something.  It's pretty obvious to what it does
[08:01] <tamacracker> Does anyone know how to make menus transparent? Like when you right click and it gives you a menu?
[08:01] <Flannel> Deedubb: which version?
[08:02] <Deedubb> that I have now?
[08:02] <Flannel> Deedubb: Of Ubuntu
[08:02] <Deedubb> Edgy
[08:02] <AlienX> what's a quality audio player besides xmms?
[08:02] <noiesmo> philip, you need to edit the /etc/gdm/gdm.conf file otherwise ubuntu-theme will remain and you wont get your inages for users well thats what I found
[08:02] <Deedubb> Flannel: it finds 1.0.0.rc9 (2005.09.23)

[08:21] <blind_> Qwerty: do you know the name of it off the top of your head?
[08:21] <Qwerty> sudo apt-get install jre sun-java5-plugin
[08:21] <coulix> apperently i have no i2c nor sysfs  modules, i will manualy compile the kernel
[08:21] <blind_> I think he installed that one, lemme ask.

[08:26] <fugitive_> im trying to install Ubuntu Dapper thru network install from a FTP site. I get an error message saying "Release" file cant found. Buti nfact the Release file is present
[08:27] <Qwerty> blind - a 64 bit machine?
[08:28] <ruxpin> fugitive_: the path isn't set properly, most probably
[08:28] <fugitive_> ruxpin: i have checked 100 times it was perfect.
[08:28] <fugitive_> ruxpin: which file we have to point it to when we network install
[08:28] <GirlRiver> I have setup 1 on my network to use a /home  mounted from another machine and although it works for user1 which already existed on the server machine, I have a rights issue with the second user. I'm not using NIs at the moment. Can someone help ?
[08:28] <ruxpin> fugitive_: try to remove the last directory from that path
[08:28] <fugitive_> ruxpin: which folder i meant
[08:29] <fugitive_> ruxpin: infact i did  point to the Release folder
[08:29] <zack> No ventrilo users on here?
[08:29] <ruxpin> fugitive_: that's probably wrong
[08:29] <ruxpin> fugitive_: I think you'll have to point a higher directory member
[08:30] <fugitive_> then where we have to point the installtion when we do network installtion.
[08:30] <fugitive_> ruxpin: higher means the top folder ?
[08:30] <ruxpin> fugitive_: I don't know the exact way to do this as I haven't done it, but I remember having the same problem when I defined some extra repos
[08:30] <robokop> how can i remove a program from the autostart list with the cli
[08:31] <fugitive_> ruxpin: how did u fix it ?
[08:31] <ruxpin> fugitive_: I tried a higher directory, probably the last dir was dapper, but I can't be sure
[08:31] <GirlRiver> Can someone help me resolve a permissions issue with /home/user auto mounted from another machine ?
[08:32] <yomisssmo> hi all
[08:32] <timfrost> GirlRiver: does the uid number match on the two machines?
[08:33] <robokop> how can i remove a program from the autostart list with the cli
[08:35] <yomisssmo> can someone help me to install nvidia-glx in my ubuntu 6.10?
[08:35] <yomisssmo> please

[08:35] <yomisssmo> tnx Jewfro-Macabbi
[08:36] <Qwerty> yomisssmo, you have apt-get available?
[08:36] <GirlRiver> timfrost, thanks for responding... as far as the uid, I believe so, this is the number listed in advanced tab and also listed via 'ls -n /home/user' is that correct ?
[08:36] <Qwerty> then its easy
[08:36] <yomisssmo> i had install the nvidia-glx packages using tye synaptic
[08:36] <yomisssmo> everything ok
[08:36] <yomisssmo> but i must activate it
[08:37] <Qwerty> oh ok 1 sec
[08:37] <Qwerty> http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Edgy#METHOD_1
[08:37] <Qwerty> follow this after glx apt command line
[08:37] <defrysk> yomisssmo, nvidia-xconfig
[08:37] <yomisssmo> sudo nvidia-glx-config enable tells me an error
[08:37] <defrysk> yomisssmo, nvidia-xconfig
[08:37] <robokop> how can i remove a program from the autostart list with the cli
[08:37] <Jewfro-Macabbi> yomissmo, listen to them, they are right
[08:37] <yomisssmo> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[08:37] <yomisssmo> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[08:37] <GirlRiver> timfrost, the strange thing is it works for one user which already existed on the server, but when I added the new user to the server it does not
[08:38] <GirlRiver> timfrost I'm not yet using NIS, is that possibly complicating things ?
[08:38] <zek> hhm, i use GDM and when i try to install a login manager it says that the file format is invalid.
[08:39] <blind> Okay, I've installed the JRE, but this website is telling me that I don't have the JRE installed... O_o
[08:39] <yomisssmo> ok, i will try now, and tells you in a moment, THX SO MUCH
[08:39] <robokop> how can i remove a program from the autostart list with the cli
[08:39] <robokop> plz help me
[08:40] <Qwerty> blind - weird, but java apps work?
[08:40] <blind> Qwerty: yeah
[08:40] <Qwerty> then fogget it :P
[08:40] <timfrost> GirlRiver: Yes, the UID is the number listed.  NIS would make it easier, because all the credentials are from the same source.  Are both users defined in BOTH computers?
[08:40] <blind> Qwerty: friend of mine's having the problem, so i tried it, getting the same one :P
[08:40] <blind> Qwerty: I'm fine with forgetting it, but my friend won't be :P
[08:40] <Jewfro-Macabbi> robokop, I'm looking, google is your friend, btw
[08:40] <Qwerty> I havent tried java either, my edgy is 6 hours fresh
[08:41] <timfrost> robokop: is it a program stared at boot?
[08:41] <robokop> timfrost it is started when i login
[08:42] <Qwerty> in gui its easy, under sessions
[08:42] <Qwerty> lemme search for cli, too.
[08:42] <Qwerty> my dns too slow today
[08:42] <Qwerty> bsnl as an isp sucks ...
[08:42] <timfrost> robokop: can you give more details (what program, how it starts, etc)?
[08:42] <GirlRiver> timfrost, yes both users defined. the only diff was that user1 already existed and user 2 (the one that does not work) was defined after I got the automount etc going for user 1. When I first created user2 the uid did not match but I changed it. I also tried deleting the user on the server including their home dir and re-creating them.
[08:43] <robokop> timfrost: it is beryl-manager
[08:43] <robokop> and i put it to start via sessions
[08:43] <teclis> blind: I have dapper, maybe it will help... have you installed the sun-java5-plugin package? have you switched the standard jre to the sun-jre(commandline)?
[08:43] <robokop> but it is malfunctional
[08:43] <scheuri> hi all
[08:44] <blind> teclis: i've installed sun-java5-plugin, but haven't done that second thing.

[08:44] <tamacracker> Is gentoo a linux modifier, or is that a type of linux?

[08:45] <blind> it's a distro, tamacracker
[08:45] <tamacracker> ok... is there a program I can download that will let me modify my menus, make them transparent?
[08:45] <GirlRiver> tamacracker, Gentoo is a distribution of Linux just like Ubuntu , Red Hat and others are
[08:45] <blind> teclis: how do i go about switching jres?
[08:46] <scheuri> does someone know the differences between "i686" and "server" kernel images in dapper (6.06.1)? Is there a website for that?
[08:46] <GirlRiver> timfrost: can you help me get NIS going then ?
[08:46] <tamacracker> Does anyone know how to configure Ubuntu so that you can have transparent menus and windows?
[08:47] <blind> tamacracker: beryl
[08:47] <GirlRiver> timfrost: that's a "please" implied :-)
[08:47] <scheuri> GirlRiver: ;)
[08:47] <Werdnum> GirlRiver: you're a liar.
[08:47] <Werdnum> everybody knows that there are no girls on the internets.
[08:47] <scheuri> tamacracker: which ubuntu do you use? 6.10?
[08:47] <timfrost> blind:  sudo update-alternatives --config java
[08:47] <tamacracker> 6.10 Edgy Eft
[08:47] <GirlRiver> Werdnum, please you're insinuating now
[08:48] <Werdnum> GirlRiver: ;-)
[08:48] <scheuri> tamacracker: there are many how tos out there telling you how do to it...however, as far as I know, it may still be a bit unstable...use at own risk
[08:48] <Zarthross> Werdnum, thats not very nice
[08:48] <Werdnum> Welcome to IRC, where all the men are men, the women are men, and the young children are FBI agents.
[08:48] <timfrost> GirlRiver: Sorry, I haven't attempted to get NIS working on ubuntu
[08:48] <tamacracker> I've been searchin for an hour
[08:48] <teclis> thx timfrost ;)
[08:48] <tamacracker> and all i keep seeing is Gentoo

[08:52] <Qwerty> and remove it then
[08:53] <blind> Staz: I love mpd. you can use several front-ends for it, including many gui ones :] 
[08:53] <Zarthross> Jewfro: is it a debian package...
[08:53] <Qwerty> sorry, failsafe gnome
[08:53] <robokop> Qwerty: but where
[08:53] <scheuri> does someone know the differences between "i686" and "server" kernel images in dapper (6.06.1)? Is there a website for that? I am especially interested if one of those two images treads more than 4GB RAM differently...
[08:53] <Jewfro-Macabbi> robokop, okay, try this: cd ~/.config/autostart :  rm beryl-manager.desktop beryl-xgl.deskto
[08:53] <Qwerty> it should be under system > prefrences > sessions and iunder startup tab
[08:53] <yomisssmo> hey guys, perfect, now i have nvidia-glx aceleration!, but i forget to save the page, can you put again to save it?
[08:53] <Qwerty> or 'might be' under .startup folder in /home/<name>

[08:55] <Zarthross> any idea how i can get a script to run after a specific file is modified?
[08:56] <oht> (wmv's weren't working in the synaptic build)
[08:56] <Jewfro-Macabbi> robokop, you may want to check out link yourself, it's got how to add it without killing X :)

[09:11] <dk0r> mzli: the editor?
[09:12] <AWOSLappy> LOL
[09:12] <zorba64> dk0r: an easier terminal editor, -w disables text wrapping
[09:12] <mzli> dk0r, yeah
[09:12] <zek> Qwerty: works ?
[09:12] <dk0r> mzli: I never have. perhaps I'll try zorba64's method.
[09:12] <mzli> dk0r, are you use Ubuntu or kubuntu?
[09:12] <dk0r> zorba64: I dont even know what text wrapping is.
[09:12] <Qwerty> yeah installing
[09:12] <dk0r> mzli: ubuntu
[09:12] <honk> must be my configure script
[09:12] <zek> Qwerty: what was the prob ?
[09:12] <mzli> sudo gedit /etc/vsftpd.conf
[09:13] <mzli> gedit is much like notepad in m$
[09:13] <dk0r> mzli: That even easier than zorba64's nano -w ?
[09:13] <AWOSLappy> And dk0r, vi stands for 'VIsual editor' per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi
[09:13] <Qwerty> it meant that another app is using the apt package manager and thus it cant function as its locked or something
[09:13] <zorba64> dk0r: if config files have their text wrapped at a certain place in the line, it may stuff 'em up
[09:13] <Qwerty> but I dont know what was using it
[09:13] <mzli> dk0r, yeah, the easist for beginner.
[09:13] <dk0r> AWOSLappy: ty
[09:13] <AWOSLappy> dk0r np :)
[09:13] <zek> Qwerty: ohh
[09:13] <timfrost> honk, yes, the configure script needs to determine where the headers are (glib-1.2/glib.h or glib-2.0/glib.h).
[09:14] <mzli> dk0r, but not best for master. vi is much better, but it's little strang to stranger.:)
[09:14] <AWOSLappy> Is there a program that can take a hexdump (as in the file says 00000000 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d ........) and make it into computer readable format?
[09:14] <al[e] x> anyone know how i can install nvidia drivers and keep linux restricted pkg installed?
[09:15] <al[e] x> nvidia wants to remove the linux restricted pkg
[09:15] <SableSlayer> automatrix
[09:15] <SableSlayer> automatrix is an easy way to install your nvidia drivers
[09:15] <SableSlayer> :)
[09:15] <zorba64> al[e] x: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx

[09:20] <dk0r> can someone help me get vsftpd going? I keep getting the error "500 OOPS: could not bind listening IPv4 socket"
[09:21] <nothlit> Can someone tell me where the xcursor settings are kept? If I use the gnome wizards, the cursor settings only seem to affect gtk applications, will update-alternatives --config x-cursor-themes update the cursors universally?
[09:22] <rickyfingers_> dk0r: sure it's actually running? ps -ef | grep -i vsftpd
[09:22] <al[e] x> SableSlayer, according to automatix website, only i386 is supported
[09:23] <dk0r> rickyfingers_: I dont know. More over, I dont know what that stuff is you typed. Can you please explain ?
[09:23] <timfrost> honk: probably with a '--use-' or '--with-' option.  Check 'configure --help'.   What are you trying to build?
[09:23] <scheuri> does anyone know where to find the/a config-file in which is descriped how the kernel was compiled (options) on dapper?
[09:24] <rickyfingers_> ok that's a command u can type in a terminal to see if vsftpd is running
[09:24] <rickyfingers_> dk0r: u should see a line with vsftpd
[09:24] <honk> timfrost, I'm trying to build this xmms plugin, xmms-nsf-0.0.2

[09:25] <scheuri> we2by: yes
[09:25] <we2by> does it support WPA?
[09:25] <dk0r> rickyfingers_: Soft or hard?
[09:25] <honk> timfrost, is this what you were talking about? :: --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]     use PACKAGE [ARG=yes] 
[09:25] <scheuri> timfrost: thanks a lot!

[09:27] <zek> Qwerty: just the icon..
[09:27] <zek> Qwerty: and btw i don't see any icons in basic :)
[09:28] <dk0r> rickyfingers_: What do you mean still? Nothing has changed. So yes
[09:28] <we2by> does ubuntu support WPA?
[09:28] <we2by> !wpa
[09:28] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:28] <Qwerty> you must see a small icon near name entry

[09:28] <zek> Qwerty: aaah
[09:28] <zek> Qwerty: what a SMALL icon
[09:28] <Qwerty> yeah lolz
[09:28] <zek> Qwerty: let me try to change it
[09:29] <Qwerty> under usr/share/xmms, theres an icon file but both dont match
[09:29] <l337f00l> when I try to login like normal it gives me an error message saying that I have only been logged in for under 10 seconds then it kicks me out and tells me to run failsafe to determine whats wrong
[09:29] <scheuri> timfrost: are you familiar with the HIGHMEM option?
[09:29] <zek> Qwerty: finally

[09:29] <zek> Qwerty: no
[09:30] <zek> Qwerty: only the icon on desktop
[09:30] <zek> Qwerty: but that's enough :)
[09:30] <timfrost> scheuri: No.  I note that it is set for the Ubuntu kernel, but I don't know what it means.
[09:31] <waecky> hello again
[09:31] <Qwerty> zek, go to System > Prefrences > Menu Layout > Sound and Video > XMMS > Rightclick it > Properties > and change icon :p

[09:31] <scheuri> anyone familiar with the HIGHMEM option?
[09:31] <zek> Qwerty: ok
[09:31] <AWOSLappy> Is there a program that can take a hexdump (as in the file says 00000000 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d 5d ........) and make it into computer readable format?
[09:32] <Qwerty> zek, something also tells me that /usr/share/xmms is also a spot for droppin icons but I dont know how to make the app chose one :P
[09:32] <dk0r> rickyfingers_: dk0r@ubuntu:~$ ftp localhost
[09:32] <dk0r> Connected to localhost.
[09:32] <dk0r> 220 (vsFTPd 2.0.4)
[09:32] <zek> Qwerty: i have to enable menu layout coz i don't have any menu layout
[09:32] <zek> Qwerty: i was trying that too
[09:32] <Qwerty> changing icons is easy on linux, on windows its terror :P
[09:32] <Qwerty> :o
[09:32] <rickyfingers_> dk0r then at least u know u can connect
[09:32] <Qwerty> i guess it should be enabled by default under edgy
[09:33] <Qwerty> on dapper it was accessories > alcarte
[09:33] <zek> Qwerty: yea, i am using dapper, i have to upgrade my version
[09:33] <AWOSLappy> So on Edgy I can't just right-click the menu and say "Menu Editor"?!
[09:33] <Qwerty> oh lol that too...
[09:33] <dk0r> rickyfingers_: Where do I access settings?
[09:33] <Qwerty> found that now, thanks :P
[09:33] <CarinArr> oo lookie.. fancy new nvidia splash
[09:34] <CarinArr> tho it looks like something from the early 90s
[09:34] <AWOSLappy> Qwerty, oh it was there?  I'm not on Edgy :P
[09:34] <Qwerty> lol the fedora splash looks much better
[09:34] <Qwerty> its 3D :P
[09:34] <Qwerty> lol yeah AWOSLappy
[09:34] <CarinArr> qwerty, than the nvidia one?
[09:34] <CarinArr> or than the ubuntu one
[09:34] <AWOSLappy> Wow.  Are you on GNOME, Qwerty?
[09:34] <rickyfingers_> dk0r: what do you want to change?
[09:34] <Qwerty> yeah AWOSLappy
[09:35] <Qwerty> CarinArr, than ubuntu's nvidia logo
[09:35] <AWOSLappy> Wow.  I was even talking about KDE.
[09:35] <Qwerty> fedora's looked better :P
[09:35] <AWOSLappy> I never modified the GNOME menus.
[09:35] <Qwerty> lol
[09:35] <AWOSLappy> So I guess I helped in a roundabout way didn't I Qwerty?  :P
[09:35] <CarinArr> doesn't the nvidia splash come from nvidia?
[09:35] <Qwerty> I hate this creepy sounds in gaim
[09:35] <AWOSLappy> Creepy sound?
[09:35] <BeanBag> Is there an way that i can make my entire ubuntu instalation a live cd, so that i can re install it easier later on?
[09:36] <Qwerty> CarinArr, I mean, on fedora repo, the nvidia kernel wahtever, had a better logo
[09:36] <AWOSLappy> BeanBag, well you could copy everything from your hard drive to a CD
[09:36] <AWOSLappy> BeanBag, then you reinstall Linux and then copy everthing from the CD back to the disk.
[09:36] <CarinArr> qwerty, oh i see.. i don't use the packaged nvidia drivers in general
[09:36] <AWOSLappy> BeanBag, that would be A LOT easier though if you use DVD+RWs vs CDs.
[09:36] <BeanBag> Which is better for sound: OSS or ASLA?
[09:37] <Qwerty> ALSA is more popular I guesses
[09:37] <BeanBag> AWOSLappy: Thanks
[09:37] <AWOSLappy> BeanBag, np, and I've had better luck with ALSA.
[09:38] <BeanBag> Is there an easy way to mount any cd image file (iso, mds, nrg)
[09:38] <AWOSLappy> Plus JACK which is the new Linux sound system uses ALSA as its backend.
[09:38] <AWOSLappy> BeanBag, mount -t iso9660 -o loop <imagefile> <mountpoint>
[09:38] <zek> Qwerty: what's the command to upgrade to edgy ?
[09:38] <AWOSLappy> zek, apt-get dist-upgrade, but it's highly unstable.
[09:38] <Qwerty> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:38] <Qwerty> yeah hell unstable
[09:39] <Qwerty> better get a cd and clean install if possible
[09:39] <yomisssmo> hi again, my system is now so good, thx a lot to everyboby :)
[09:39] <zek> oh, well when will be stable i will write that command :)
[09:39] <AWOSLappy> zek, it will never be fully stable.  It is *much* better to back up and then do a clean install.
[09:40] <oht> does anyone have *any* idea why wmv files won't run in the ubuntu build of mplayer?
[09:40] <AWOSLappy> oht, Copyright.
[09:40] <zek> AWOSLappy: yes but i don't have cds with edgy
[09:40] <oht> -_-
[09:40] <AWOSLappy> zek, burn them!
[09:40] <oht> so how can i change that, i have the binary codek pack
[09:41] <BeanBag> AWOSLappy: Does that command work only for iso images, or for any image file, also, would it be possible to put that in a script (i have a lot of image files...)
[09:41] <AWOSLappy> oht, WMVs are really a whole other breed.
[09:41] <oht> when i compiled mplayer myself, WMVs worked fine
[09:41] <oht> but when i 'upgraded' to the ubuntu build, they stopped working
[09:42] <AWOSLappy> BeanBag, well substitute -t iso9660 for -t vfat.
[09:42] <tamacracker> Hey guys... how coMe i can't type the letter M in lower case?
[09:42] <tamacracker> i just installed Beryl
[09:42] <BeanBag>  AWOSLappy: What does that mean??
[09:43] <oht> tamacracker: lol, it probably messed up one of your keybindings with M
[09:43] <tamacracker> >.> what do I do?
[09:43] <Qwerty> BeanBag, he meant mount <options> <image> <location>
[09:43] <Qwerty> and he gave options
[09:43] <tamacracker> It also took off the top part of My windows... so i dont have the MIniMize, MaxiMize, and close buttons
[09:44] <AWOSLappy> BeanBag, -t iso9660 is for CDs.  -t vfat is for floppys.
[09:44] <oht> AWOSLappy: any advice on how to get wmv's working for the ubuntu build? or should i just forget about it?
[09:44] <AWOSLappy> oht, I have never been able to play a WMV on any Linux, WMAs can though.
[09:44] <AWOSLappy> Sorry.
[09:44] <link_36p> anyone know where i can find begginers monodevelop tuts?
[09:44] <oht> hehe, ok, whatever
[09:44] <AWOSLappy> oht, you could TRY vlc
[09:44] <rickyfingers_> anyone here know why these little dots appear all over an image when dragging a mouse over the image?
[09:45] <oht> well i mean, like i said, they worked fine when i compiled it myself
[09:45] <rickyfingers_> in GIMP
[09:45] <honk> does anyone have any packages of xmms-nsf?
[09:46] <AWOSLappy> oht -- you can try vlc, it's in the repos.
[09:46] <AWOSLappy> !info vlc

[09:56] <Gogger> Nagios?
[09:56] <berteh> hi everyone. I want to upgrade-dist from Warty to Edgy. do I need to go through Warty->Hoary->Breezy->Edgy or can I do Warty->Edgy at once?
[09:56] <nocturn> Gogger: A network monitoring system
[09:56] <nocturn> GPL'ed
[09:56] <berteh> @nocturn no, not using Nagios.
[09:57] <nocturn> I've had it running on my Ubuntu server for 18 months now
[09:57] <nocturn> survived my Hoary->Breezy->Dapper upgrade cycle
[09:57] <Flannel> berteh: yes, you need to do it one by one.  You're probably better off just backing up and installing edgy (and you forgot Dapper)
[09:57] <nocturn> But a recent outage highlighted a problem wiht my setup
[09:58] <nocturn> so I'm looking for some advice
[09:58] <berteh> @flannel ok, thanks.

[09:59] <Qwerty> o.O little dots?
[10:00] <Qwerty> um sorry my bad
[10:00] <rickyfingers_> Qwerty - what I mean is when I open a file in gimp
[10:00] <Sp4rKy> can you help me with debmirror
[10:00] <berteh> aimaz: if running gnome please try System-Preference-keyboard
[10:00] <aimaz> i'm using xfce
[10:00] <rickyfingers_> and drag the mouse over it, it puts these little black dots everywhere I drag the mouse
[10:00] <Sp4rKy> http://paste.sos-sts.com/?28 <=== that's the log
[10:00] <rickyfingers_> when I change a tool, the dots all go away
[10:01] <rickyfingers_> they're just a minor annoyance
[10:01] <rickyfingers_> but I don't know if it's a bug or a feature in GIMP
[10:01] <Qwerty> oh ok... me donno
[10:01] <Spee_Der> Sp4rKy: I'm looking at it......
[10:01] <zumiez> Anyone have any GOOD or BAD experiences with the thing called "Cedega" that runs windows games.....?????
[10:02] <teclis> zumiez: yes I have ;)
[10:02] <aimaz> zumiez, i used it with the latest sim city and it worked fine

[10:03] <aimaz> berteh, thanks
[10:03] <berteh> np
[10:03] <teclis> zumiez: i used it with World of Warcraft. The sound was not like on a windows machine. Framerate was the same.
[10:03] <Spee_Der> Sp4rKy: Look at this file, /usr/bin/debmirror and in line 1300 see what file you need to have in order for that to work correctly.
[10:04] <Spee_Der> Sp4rKy: I went through this with the Dapper updater.....
[10:05] <Sp4rKy> Spee_Der: someone says me to use debpartial-mirror
[10:06] <reazn> !latest
[10:06] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[10:06] <Spee_Der> Sp4rKy: Are you using Synaptic for updating ?
[10:06] <Wodger> a phaze i like is bleeding edge
[10:07] <nothlit> Can someone tell me where the xcursor settings are kept? If I use the gnome wizards, the cursor settings only seem to affect gtk applications, will update-alternatives --config x-cursor-themes update the cursors universally?

[10:14] <sandy16> tamacracker, yah i sue beryl
[10:14] <Qwerty> :o
[10:14] <alc> tamacracker, me, now =)
[10:15] <tamacracker> I'm having a small problem.

[10:15] <alc> thats quite easy on edgy
[10:15] <tamacracker> I dont know if its supposed to be like this but, my minimize, maximize, and close buttons and the whole top part of my windows are missing... lol
[10:16] <IOWAHC> Hy there. I compiled glib 2.12 .... but 2.10 is still there becauses ubuntu-desktop needs it.... how can I tell it to use 2.12
[10:16] <IOWAHC> ?
[10:16] <Qwerty> ah... run beryl-manager again?
[10:16] <tamacracker> run it again?
[10:16] <tamacracker> should I log out or restart?
[10:16] <Qwerty> that happened a lot on compiz for me, on beryl it happened once, then I typed beryl-manager in terminal and it appeared :S
[10:17] <tamacracker> lol let me try that.
[10:17] <Qwerty> tried restarting before?
[10:18] <tamacracker> i haven't restarded
[10:18] <fnf> IOWAHC: You need to compile and install ubuntu-desktop yourself, otherwise some serious hacks would be needed, but that eventually will confuse dpkg

[10:18] <xiownthisplacex> Now, ive just installed Ubuntu 6.1 and i needed to do this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102 in order to get my wireless working in ubuntu..
[10:18] <xiownthisplacex> But i could only get the guest-e-U(thats for us to connect in order to download the SecureW2) and i cant even see the e-U on network-manager.
[10:18] <IOWAHC> ok
[10:18] <IOWAHC> thx
[10:18] <xiownthisplacex> can anyone help me?
[10:18] <tamacracker> in fact, when i did log off... the xorg.conf was incorrect and i had to load up the back up
[10:20] <tamacracker> it's basically taking the windows of any application, and shiftin it up, so that the part where the buttons are, look like they're "behind" the panel.
[10:20] <tamacracker> then when i move it down, they're missing/
[10:20] <tamacracker> gonna restart

[10:42] <TimothyP> Hi, is there something different in ubuntu 6.10 as to how routing works ? I have 2 network cards in the mashine, with networks 172.17.0.0/16 and 192.168.0.0/24 on them. normally I add 1 to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and routing between the two networks always works, but not on 6.10 , can't get it to work (masquerading from one to another does work but that's not what I need)

[10:58] <crimsun> hmm, where's the Device Manager in Dapper?
[10:58] <braddockbr> ok hehe.. ive got gcc-4.0 ... how to rename it to only "gcc" ? isnt on /bin/
[10:58] <stephan21_> can i upgrade 6.0.6 to 6.0.10 or do i gotta lose all must stuff
[10:58] <daxxar> Flannel, I tried that, hm.
[10:59] <daxxar> Shift F5, then?
[10:59] <MattJ> braddockbr: Did you get it from the repositories?
[10:59] <braddockbr> MattJ: yup!
[10:59] <MattJ> and it's not gcc? o_O
[10:59] <daxxar> Hm. *kicks his schools webauthentication for WLAN*
[11:00] <Flannel> daxxar: no, in FF reload is ctrl-R, and ctrl-shift-R is refresh (which is what youre looking for)
[11:00] <braddockbr> MattJ: nope...gcc-4.0
[11:00] <Werdnum> what's the diff?
[11:00] <MattJ> braddockbr: Install the build-essential package, if you haven't alreadu
[11:00] <MattJ> *already
[11:01] <daxxar> Flannel, thanks. Doesn't seem to work, but I'm not sure why.
[11:02] <Chetic> What lib is "libCg.so" part of? And don't think I haven't searched...
[11:03] <MattJ> braddockbr: If that package doesn't give you a /bin/gcc, type: sudo ln -s /bin/gcc-4.0 /bin/gcc
[11:03] <Flannel> MattJ, braddockbr, no.
[11:03] <MattJ> Flannel: ?
[11:03] <Flannel> braddockbr: the package "gcc" installs gcc.
[11:04] <MattJ> build-essential depends on it, does it not?
[11:04] <sobersabre> hi
[11:04] <Flannel> MattJ: it does, he must not have build-essential installed
[11:04] <braddockbr> Flannel: hm I see .. but dont want to download 12mb again.... isn the gcc gcc4.0?
[11:04] <MattJ> Flannel: erm... why?
[11:04] <braddockbr> can I temporary link it ?
[11:04] <Flannel> braddockbr: no.  gcc depends on gcc4.0
[11:04] <MattJ> Flannel: I have it...
[11:05] <Flannel> braddockbr: no, gcc4.0 doesn't necessarily contain all of gcc, infact, I know it doesnt
[11:05] <Flannel> MattJ: right, he doesn't have b-e installed
[11:05] <braddockbr> Flannel: hmm .. so i need an apt-get install gcc ?
[11:05] <Flannel> braddockbr: apt-get install build-essential
[11:05] <boink> you need apt-get install build-essential
[11:06] <arnducky> What Xserver version does Edgey presently use?
[11:06] <braddockbr> doing.. xD ty
[11:06] <Flannel> need is a bit strong.  But that'll be sure to have anything you need
[11:06] <boink> it installs enuf
[11:06] <MattJ> Flannel: I thought you just said...??!?!
[11:06] <Flannel> MattJ: What?
[11:06] <MattJ> nm ^^
[11:07] <MattJ> Flannel: I thought you were saying he shouldn't have build-essential
[11:07] <MattJ> Flannel: I told him to install it
[11:08] <Flannel> MattJ: I said nothing of the sort.  Just that he doesn't necessarily need it.  He should have it.  He shouldn't symlink to get around him not having gcc
[11:08] <MattJ> Flannel: Yeah well, I said do that if build-essential didn't :) I'm surprised the gcc package doesn't
[11:09] <Flannel> MattJ: gcc package does, gcc4.1 package doesnt

[11:14] <Flannel> khaije1: sudo keeps track of when you last used sudo, to keep your password (which is why it keeps it for five minutes, etc), it also checks to make sure that the last time you used sudo was actually before you just used it (so someone couldnt just set the time back a day to get access), there is a small window (for time correction) that it's allowed to be in the future, sometimes it's too far ;)
[11:16] <khaije1> Flannel: i wish i had known it was so simple, i had to sign out of my root shell to hurry and get to work... :-/
[11:16] <bun-bun> daxxar# set it in preferences
[11:16] <khaije1> Flannel: holy crap you fixed it!!!!!
[11:17] <Flannel> sandy16: ask in #beryl
[11:17] <khaije1> Flannel: i thought i was screwed and would need to power cycle the machine
[11:17] <bun-bun> daxxar# if you're using ff2 you might also want to set browser.link.open_newwindow to 3 in about:config
[11:17] <Flannel> khaije1: nah, even in the worst case, you'd just wait until the time catches up with the timestamp, which usually isn't too far ahead

[11:22] <hi2u> can someone help me?
[11:22] <Steven_M> hi2u: with what?
[11:22] <hi2u> im trying to run ubuntu off a cd i start my computer and it the first option, it says loading linux kernel and just stops there, do i have to do something then?
[11:23] <hi2u> i pick the frist option*
[11:23] <eilker> what is the difference between ubuntu and ubuntu server ? is it only gui and lamp server ? if i install lamp server on ubuntu, does it become ubuntu server ?
[11:23] <MattJ> hi2u: How much RAM do you have?
[11:23] <bimberi> eilker: yes
[11:24] <bimberi> eilker: they share the same repositories
[11:24] <hi2u> 448 mb
[11:24] <MattJ> hi2u: Plenty
[11:24] <hi2u> yea so whys it just stop
[11:24] <hi2u> am i supposed to type something in
[11:24] <khaije1> Flannel: the thing is, i had to ask... even reading the man page i didn't understand enough of what was said to figure it out on my own, so i really appreciate yr help :-)
[11:24] <Steven_M> hi2u: you shouldn't need to do anything
[11:24] <Flannel> eilker: depending on how you install your GUI-less ubuntu installation (server CD vs alternate CD), you get  different kernel (yes for server CD, no for alternate)
[11:25] <hi2u> i waited like 45 minutes nothing happened at all
[11:25] <MattJ> hi2u: Try hitting enter, just in case :)
[11:25] <hi2u> ok
[11:25] <hi2u> ill be back either way
[11:25] <MattJ> Did you get the boot menu?
[11:25] <hi2u> yea
[11:25] <eilker> flannel: i installed kubuntu 6.06 /not server cd/  than installed lamp server, now is mine kubuntu server ?
[11:26] <hi2u> im supposed to pick the first option to boot from the cd correct
[11:26] <MattJ> hi2u: Could be a hardware problem
[11:26] <eilker> bimberi: do u use ubuntu server ?
[11:26] <MattJ> hi2u: Yeah
[11:26] <Flannel> eilker: sure.  There's no difference between a 'desktop' and a 'server' in linux, theyre both perfectly suited for either
[11:26] <MattJ> eilker: I have a LAMP server, on my GUI installation
[11:27] <MattJ> eilker: I just installed the packages myself, instead of the installer doing it
[11:27] <Flannel> eilker: the 'server' CD isn't anything special, just a GUI-less prefab configuration.  It's exactly the same as if you installed a desktop, then removed all the GUI stuff
[11:27] <bimberi> eilker: yes, mine started from an alternate CD install
[11:28] <chenwgm> 
[11:28] <eilker> flannel: as i read, you can disable gui in kubuntu server, now do i have chance to disable gui in my system? remember pls kubuntu desktop + lamp server

[11:39] <khaije1> Flannel: so much of the problem is knowing what/how to ask, and figuring out if the idea you have in yr head is possible or exists. I've been spoiled by linux over the years, by now i expect to be able to do anything i want :-)
[11:39] <Genrl_Zod> did sum1 post a link?
[11:39] <boink> and what are you trying to download?
[11:39] <Genrl_Zod> i think i missed it
[11:39] <MattJ> pip: Give us the URL, or paste the contents to pastebin
[11:39] <eilker> in consol which command shows my wan ip  ?
[11:39] <hi2u> when i try to run ubuntu from a cd it says loading all this stuff.... ok, then it says "uncompressing linux, ok... loading kernel" at that point it just stops, what do i do?
[11:39] <Genrl_Zod> I just nbeed an audio/video codec pack to use with ubuntu, any good ones out there?
[11:39] <MattJ> eilker: Try ifconfig
[11:39] <eilker> mattj: it gives lan ip
[11:39] <Genrl_Zod> well if ur on a router it wont gfive u wan
[11:40] <pip> Matt, the file will get downloaded after you registered your own account
[11:40] <Flannel> khaije1: well, I imagine there is a way.  you can use 'who' to keep track of current log ins, and Im sure theres a way to terminate those, Im just not sure what that is
[11:40] <Genrl_Zod> so u have to go on google and go to whatsmyip.org
[11:40] <Genrl_Zod> the borweser will tell u ur WAN ip.
[11:40] <MattJ> eilker: It gives all IP addresses for me, I'm not sure then
[11:40] <itclanster> ya it works
[11:40] <eilker> genri_zod: yes i have router
[11:40] <Genrl_Zod> maybe ifconfig /all?
[11:40] <MattJ> eilker: You want http://whatismyip.org/ ?
[11:40] <pip> Matt, so I can not give you the URL but I can give you the file link I copied
[11:40] <pip> Matt, http://www.qnx.com/download/download/14619/6.3.0SP3-qnx6-200610121339.iso
[11:40] <itclanster> it will show ur public ip if u r behind nat
[11:41] <eilker> mattj: there was a command to see it, i forgot, and i cant remember...
[11:41] <pip> Matt, can you download it normally ?
[11:42] <MattJ> pip: No, it asks for login
[11:42] <hi2u> when i try to run ubuntu from a cd it says loading all this stuff.... ok, then it says "uncompressing linux, ok... loading kernel" at that point it just stops, what do i do?
[11:42] <pip> MattJ, right !
[11:42] <pip> MattJ, so it is classified
[11:43] <itclanster> my desktop screen in ubuntu flickers a lot and it work ok with windowsxp  how should i rectify it
[11:43] <khaije1> Flannel: the only way i know is the `ps aux | grep ssh | grep [pts from last command] ` then kill the shell, is that kinda what you were saying?
[11:43] <itclanster> plz tell me if thr r some settings
[11:43] <harm_> Does anyone know where i can check the status of my server? Logs which deamons are runninge etc?
[11:43] <MattJ> pip: lynx could probably get that, of you supply the login
[11:43] <MattJ> pip: If you want it without logging in, I doubt that can be done
[11:43] <daxxar> tifm_7xx1: sd card detected in socket 1
[11:44] <daxxar> ^-- Any suggestions as to what device-name that sd card will be accessible under?
[11:44] <pip> MattJ, NO,I have an account
[11:44] <pip> MattJ, does elink support continute download skill ?
[11:45] <Khamael> is there a way to change the boot theme?
[11:45] <Flannel> harm_: /var/log will have logs, some stuff keeps logs of when it starts, stops, etc.  ps will give you stuff currently running
[11:46] <harm_> Flannel u use Msn or something so i can ask some questions iam fairly new to having a server and ive had 2 hack attempts
[11:47] <Flannel> harm_: you can ask here, hack attempts from where? ssh?
[11:48] <harm_> Flannel FTP attacks
[11:48] <Genrl_Zod> so any1 direct me to a good codec pack for ubuntu?
[11:48] <harm_> Flannel i only have FTP forwarded to outside the network
[11:49] <harm_> Genrl_Zod easyubuntu or automatix2
[11:49] <itclanster> how to download ubuntu source code
[11:49] <itclanster> or to get it online
[11:49] <Genrl_Zod> which is best one harm ? which flava do u use?
[11:50] <Flannel> Genrl_Zod: don't use either.
[11:50] <harm_> Gentl_Zod i used automatix2 u just click which things u want and it install them for you such as: Codecs/Skype/InternetVideoplayingstuff etc etc :)

[11:50] <ubotu> Genrl_Zod: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[11:50] <Flannel> harm_: please don't recommend automatix here.
[11:51] <harm_> Flannel ok :) works like a charm but i see ur point
[11:51] <Delkster> itclanster, which part? I'm not sure if you can get the source code to the entire system in one piece but for any particular package you can get the source by enabling the source repositories and using the "apt-get source" command.
[11:51] <harm_> Flannel i had some polish and Malaysian kid beat the hell out of my server for 3 hours
[11:51] <Flannel> harm_: your ftp server mightve kept logs in /var/log, you might try checking there.
[11:51] <harm_> Flannel they just dictonary or bruteforce
[11:51] <LaCReMeL> yok
[11:51] <harm_> Flannel i have the logs..
[11:52] <LaCReMeL> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvMRLAzMBw
[11:52] <LaCReMeL> zuhahahahahah
[11:52] <LaCReMeL> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvMRLAzMBw
[11:52] <harm_> Flannel but how do i improve my secruty and which daemons can i shut down, because more deamons - more vulnerabilities right?
[11:52] <LaCReMeL> watch it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvMRLAzMBw
[11:52] <LaCReMeL> :D
[11:52] <LaCReMeL> wonderfuuuull
[11:52] <LaCReMeL> :D
[11:52] <Delkster> harm_, I keep getting dictionary attacks against the ftp server, too, but they have a strong tendency of not getting in. ;-)
[11:53] <Flannel> harm_: ubuntu has nothing listening by default, so only things you've added are listening
[11:54] <harm_> Delkster is tehre some autoban system i can set up?
[11:54] <LaCReMeL> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvMRLAzMBw
[11:54] <harm_> Flannel ok thats a relief to hear.. and that video IS NOT funny
[11:54] <Delkster> harm_, I've thought about that, too, but haven't really searched
[11:55] <harm_> Delkster cuz atm iam banning people in some weird IPtable command line way :)
[11:55] <khaije1> harm_: Delkster: i was interested in this too, does sshd autoblock after multiple successive failed auth attemps
[11:55] <harm_> khaije1 as i stated i only fogured out  how to ban some one from your system manually
[11:55] <neildarlow> khaije1: not sshd itself but pam policy, i believe
[11:55] <Delkster> harm_, maybe some interesting combination of just plain firewalling rules with iptables would allow you to automagically stop responding to someone when they've tried connecting the the given port a certain number of times within a certain period
[11:56] <harm_> like like 10tries < 15minutes = ban
[11:56] <Delkster> My iptables-fu isn't very strong, though, and I don't know how you'd actually do that.
[11:56] <harm_> i shall google
[11:56] <Delkster> Yeah, or usually the brute forcers and dictionary attackers try even more often
[11:57] <harm_> Delkster i normally get 2 tries every 3 seconds
[11:57] <Flannel> harm_: you should try something like denyhosts: http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/ although I think that particular one is ssh centric
[11:57] <khaije1> neildarlow: i've readabout pam_abl or something like that but i don't see it in the repositories, just wondering if if anyone had any luck/experience with this
[11:57] <khaije1> Flannel: oh! interesting...
[11:58] <Delkster> harm_, exactly... so maybe you could make the rule something like >20 attempts in <45 seconds or something
[11:58] <harm_> Flannel yah but i dont have port22 open only 21
[11:58] <harm_> Delkster scripting isnt my thing.. i play cs1.6 8)
[11:58] <Madeye> any idea how to get bluetooth working with Breezy ?

[12:02] <SpComb> JamieBE: before trying to compile something from source, make sure that there isn't a existing ubuntu package for it... apt-get install <foo> is considerably easier
[12:03] <JamieBE> Delkster/Adminal_Chicago: I am trying to install Akamaru: http://people.freedesktop.org/~krh/akamaru.git/
[12:03] <JamieBE> SpComb - No luck there.

[12:06] <michaelr> hi
[12:07] <Admiral_Chicago> well i don't know much about compiling from source
[12:07] <michaelr> was geht?
[12:07] <Admiral_Chicago> have you read the INSTALL file?
[12:07] <JamieBE> Admiral_Chicago: I also did a search for "atk" and installed all the dev's for that too that were missing before - No chance though.
[12:08] <Delkster> I can't try compiling it now either because I'm not on my Ubuntu computer.
[12:08] <JamieBE> Admiral_Chicago: Me neither, It's a shame no real cross-platform standard has been set and implemented properly within Linux yet. It would make life a lot easier.
[12:08] <[sYn] > JamieBE, I can't find the exact post (with the link..) but I found the section you should be checking out.. http://forum.beryl-project.org/forum-17-kiba-dock  the program is called kiba-dock, it uses Akamaru and works great

[12:11] <JamieBE> sYn - Not a lot of anything :)
[12:12] <[sYn] > Is this the kiba-dock app or just Akamaru? I found Akamaru to be pretty..  featureless :P
[12:13] <JamieBE> sYn - What is the command for running kiba-dock?
[12:13] <[sYn] > kiba-dock :D
[12:13] <JamieBE> sYn - I did that, the icons flash on the screen for a second and then disappear

[12:48] <cristian> algien abla espain
[12:48] <rc-1> the gui chooser is broken
[12:50] <Terminus> nocturn: no way around it i guess, unless you have a list of the modules you use that you can pass to aptitude, and making the list is more work anyway.
[12:51] <KenSentMe> How can i count the number of files in a folder from cli? With ls?
[12:51] <nocturn> Terminus: A shame.  I hoped for a meta package, so I could remove all old modules, and put one aptitude command in :-(
[12:52] <Gothi[c] > KenSentMe: ls | cat -n

[12:52] <Terminus> KenSentMe: ls|wc -l would also work.
[12:53] <nickolas> how to ls only directories?
[12:53] <Gothi[c] > ls -d
[12:53] <Gothi[c] > eh no
[12:54] <Admiral_Chicago> ls --directory
[12:54] <Gothi[c] > -d = --directory
[12:54] <nickolas> nope. doesnt work.
[12:54] <nickolas> i just want to see all directories in a directory
[12:55] <Admiral_Chicago> -d, --directory  list directory entries instead of contents, and do not  dereference symbolic links
[12:55] <Staz> Yep but it also lists the files in the pwd
[12:55] <Staz> even with the -d switch
[12:56] <Vorbote> OK, find /dir/. -type f -print | wc -l
[12:56] <rc-1> please... how do i choose in command line what opens MP3 files
[12:56] <nickolas> for me in bash it just gives "."
[12:56] <Staz> nickolas maybe "ls -d */"
[12:57] <Vorbote> Of course you need to add checks to stop recursing if there are subdirs

[12:58] <Staz> How what?
[12:58] <nickolas> explain the */ bit
[12:58] <Staz> well all directories end in '/'

[01:41] <MattJ> Do you want it for all users that can sudo, or just your user?

[01:43] <webben> jordo23, it's not "source" it's a compiled plugin
[01:43] <felixjet> i dont know xD i added %felixjet ALL=(ALL) ALL
[01:44] <webben> jordo23, like the other ones in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[01:44] <webben> jordo23, apt-cache show flashplugin-nonfree shows that all that does it pull down a tarfile from Adobe anyway
[01:44] <MattJ> felixjet: felixjet ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
[01:44] <webben> it just handles the installation and uninstallation for you
[01:44] <MattJ> felixjet: That should do it
[01:45] <felixjet> MattJ but that will give me privileges using sudo, BUT , ill need to use "sudo" for root commands, right?

[02:00] <coz_> usr13, I use mplayer and the mozilla-mplayer plugin for firefox to play online movies etc
[02:01] <usr13> Yes, that's what I was hoping for, the browser plugin.
[02:01] <usr13> Let me check that link.
[02:01] <boink> kaffeine also works well as a plugin
[02:01] <coz_> usr13, that link opens up mplayer but it won't play, the video may be unavailable
[02:02] <boink> coz_: try kaffeine then
[02:02] <XCute4God> hey guys, i have a broadcom ethernet controller, its very slow using tg3 module, i dont know why
[02:02] <XCute4God> 04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5721 Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express (rev 11)
[02:02] <boink> I found kaffeine to work much better than the mplayer plugin
[02:02] <XCute4God> anyone can help-me?
[02:02] <usr13> Ok, I have realplayer for Linux on this slackware system and it plays on that ok.... so, I guess that's an option.
[02:02] <coz_> boink, well I try to keep KDE things off of my system withgnome
[02:02] <coz_> boink, have you played that link
[02:02] <usr13> Is there a pre-compiled version of RealPlayer for Ubuntu?
[02:02] <boink> ok, don't use it
[02:02] <NyamuK> Ubuntu 6.10 : how to convert .dat files to .ogg ? thanks.
[02:03] <boink> usr13: for dapper, yes
[02:03] <boink> I'm not sure about edgy
[02:03] <usr13> boink: So, how could I tell my sister the easiest way to install RealPlayer for Linux?
[02:03] <kompressor> #ubuntu-za
[02:04] <coz_> usr13, she is running dapper or edgy?
[02:04] <usr13> use synaptic Package Manager?  (I don't know if I spelled that right)?
[02:04] <felixjet> !opengl
[02:04] <NyamuK> usr13 : open terminal : sudo apt-get install realplay
[02:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about opengl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:04] <coz_> usr13, yes
[02:04] <felixjet> !ogl
[02:04] <usr13> coz_:  Let me look
[02:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ogl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:04] <boink> user13: for which one? dapper or edgy?
[02:04] <usr13> 6.0.6-1
[02:04] <boink> that's dapper
[02:05] <boink> you'll need to modify the sources.list
[02:05] <coz_> usr13,you will findmost of what you need in synaptic and the ubuntu restricted formats I will give you that link also hold on
[02:05] <usr13> sudo apt-get install realplay is probably the best bet, right?
[02:05] <Silencer[W] > is is possible to emulate unix / sco programs on ubuntu ?
[02:05] <boink> http://cuba.calyx.nl/~oink/ubuntu-sources.list <= that's my ubuntu sources list for dapper. check that out and modify it for your own needs
[02:05] <coz_> usr13, here is the link for the restricted format read carefully https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[02:05] <NyamuK> usr13: yes... simple command
[02:06] <boink> once your sources.list is updated, then you can install it
[02:06] <boink> first .. apt-cache search realplay if it's there
[02:06] <MattJ> usr13: It is a simple command, but you need to do what boink says first
[02:06] <boink> then apt-get install realplay
[02:06] <coz_> usr13, also make sure you have enabled all of the repositories
[02:07] <felixjet> how to check open gl support?
[02:07] <felixjet> i cant find the command in google :(
[02:07] <usr13> coz_: what is the easiest way to tell her how to enable all repositories
[02:07] <usr13> ?
[02:08] <boink> user13: use a magic wand
[02:08] <boink> damm, what's the point of explaining things :/
[02:08] <usr13> Oh I see:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[02:08] <coz_> usr13, well .. the easiest way is to go to synaptic , click on system then repsositories and be sure they are al checked
[02:09] <MattJ> .
[02:09] <coz_> usr13, however the best way is to use the terminal and type this ins   sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:09] <XCute4God> i have an ATI x700 on my notebook, ive activated my 3D acceleration, but it still slow... 370fps in glxgears.... anyone knows why????

[02:10] <felixjet> MattJ :)

[02:12] <sitchin> can someone pls help
[02:12] <MattJ> sitchin: What do you mean, it crashed?
[02:12] <sitchin> cos i need to backup some important file
[02:12] <coz_> sitchin, first is this a dual booted system with windows/ubuntu?
[02:13] <sitchin> MattJ: dusing install
[02:13] <sitchin> *during
[02:13] <sitchin> ye dual boot system
[02:13] <MattJ> sitchin: Which was installed first?
[02:13] <coz_> sitchin, ok and when you reboot do you get the grub menu?
[02:13] <navaladi__> that file has FAT32 partition
[02:13] <sitchin> matt: windows, but that aborted during install
[02:13] <sitchin> coz: no
[02:13] <tuckerm>  I need to change permissions on my usb mp3 to copy files to it, right clicking and doing it that way wont work, saying access is denied
[02:13] <MattJ> navaladi__: FAT32 doesn't have permissions?
[02:13] <sitchin> i booted from the cdrom
[02:14] <coz_> sitchin, ok are the files you need to back up on the windows partition or the ubuntu partition
[02:14] <sitchin> on the ntfs & fat partition
[02:14] <Zyclop> tuckerm: that's because you need to be root to do that.
[02:14] <MattJ> navaladi__: Possibly it is mounted as read-only?
[02:14] <okhans> 
[02:14] <coz_> sitchin, mm have you tried to reinstall ubuntu
[02:14] <okhans> hi
[02:14] <navaladi__> MattJ - then i m setting up a apache server i want to make a link to those files then how others can read the file?
[02:14] <sitchin> and when i run ubuntu install it says "no root defined" after 15% of 'checking file system'
[02:14] <Vorbote> tuckerm: check the ownerships on the /media/... directory. Are they root:plugdev?
[02:15] <tuckerm> How do i get root to change it zyclop
[02:15] <coz_> sitchin, well are you using the live cd or the alternative cd
[02:15] <sitchin> coz: em live cd i think
[02:15] <wimpies>  Hi all, need some help with ifupdown ... Upgraded some packages and now I get SIOCSIFADDR : Permission denied when running ifup eth0
[02:15] <MattJ> navaladi__: If it's permissions, chmod a+r *.mp3
[02:15] <wimpies> network card works under windows
[02:15] <Zyclop> tuckerm: try typing "sudo nautilus --no-desktop" (without quotes) into a terminal and then do the right click thing again
[02:15] <coz_> sitchin, the live cd boots into ubuntu desktop and from there there is abutton to press to install, is that the one?
[02:16] <sitchin> i could reformat but dont wanna lose a year's worth of music making
[02:16] <sitchin> coz: yes
[02:16] <sitchin> that all works
[02:16] <sitchin> but there is a prob with the partitions
[02:16] <MattJ> sitchin: You should be able to grab your files using the livecd?
[02:16] <tuckerm> sudo nautilus --no-desktop
[02:16] <tuckerm> er
[02:16] <navaladi__> Mattj - The entire filesystem is like this drwxrwx---
[02:16] <coz_> sitchin, ok yikes let me thing here, ok when you press the instll button on ubuntu do you try to create your own partition
[02:16] <tuckerm> It didtn work
[02:16] <floating> Hello. I have just managed to get my broadcom4318 light on on the xubuntu edgy(with native drivers to /lib/firmware. dhclient cannot connect. iwlist scan can scan my AP.I dont have any wifi managers. Should I try one here in bottom http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102 , or what should I do next ?
[02:17] <navaladi__> Mattj - Even if i m using chmod 777 *.mp3
[02:17] <tuckerm> Failed to open session DBUS connection: Did not receive a reply.
[02:17] <MattJ> navaladi__: I don't understand the problem
[02:17] <sitchin> coz: yes i dont want to format the drive and its previous FS's
[02:17] <felixjet> !beryl
[02:17] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[02:17] <navaladi__> Mattj - or chmod 777 folder  -R
[02:17] <MattJ> navaladi__: Are you making a link for apache to follow?
[02:17] <navaladi__> Mattj - yes i m making a link to the FAT32 ..rather than copy a files to /var/www/
[02:18] <Zyclop> tuckerm: hmm, then you'll have to try it the hard way with chmod.
[02:18] <MattJ> navaladi__: Ah, right
[02:18] <tuckerm> ok, how can i do that zyclop
[02:18] <MattJ> navaladi__: I've never got Apache to follow links
[02:18] <coz_> sitchin, mm ok  i understand about the files you want to save... you may want to let ubuntu format the partition on the existing pubuntu partition.. if you understadn what I mean, instead of trying to creat your own
[02:18] <sitchin> when i try to install using the previous partitioning, which worked, i get a 'no root defined' error and it stops the install
[02:18] <navaladi__> MattJ - then I can not all the m3 files to /var/www/ & make it read for others
[02:18] <Zyclop> tuckerm: well, i havent worked with chmod yet, i'm trying to find out how
[02:19] <PumpkinPie> I plugged in a USB nic into "ubuntu server" and I get nothing... ?
[02:19] <coz_> sitchin, then i am going to let you ask another person here because I generally d not have this problem so am not skilled on this particular issue please kep asking
[02:19] <tuckerm> Alright, thank you for all your help, i'm going to see what i can do.
[02:19] <sitchin> ok thanks anyway, coz
[02:20] <sitchin> mer i might just format the whole thing ...
[02:20] <coz_> sitchin, sorry i know the frustration with this... good luck
[02:20] <sitchin> most stuff is on the net in mp3 format anyway
[02:20] <navaladi__> MattJ - Also i can not make a mp3 file readable for others
[02:20] <coz_> sitchin, if you do that you will lose the music you have on windows patition
[02:20] <kingrayray> what does it mean when you sudo kill -9 something, and the process doesn't die?
[02:20] <navaladi__> MattJ - u got my problem?
[02:20] <coz_> sitchin, is this music you have created or downloaded
[02:20] <sitchin> coz: i know, but it doesnt look like i'm gonna solve this puzzle right now
[02:21] <MattJ> navaladi__: Yeah, I'm trying in #apache
[02:21] <sitchin> coz: own creations
[02:21] <coz_> sitchin, no no it can be solved
[02:21] <coz_> sitchin, and i am a compser myself so this is important that this be solved
[02:21] <navaladi__> MattJ - wait wait..look at this
[02:21] <navaladi__> root@navaladi-desktop:/media/hda6# chmod 777 song.mp3
[02:21] <navaladi__> root@navaladi-desktop:/media/hda6# ls -l song.mp3
[02:21] <navaladi__> -rwxrwx--- 1 root plugdev 0 2006-11-13 19:01 song.mp3
[02:21] <navaladi__> root@navaladi-desktop:/media/hda6#
[02:21] <navaladi__> MattJ - Now u understand
[02:21] <coz_> sitchin, long shot here, do you have anyone close by that has another system
[02:22] <sitchin> the weird thing is, in the 'prepare partitions' screen, it says i have 80 GiB unallocated
[02:22] <sitchin> coz: no i havent, sadly
[02:22] <coz_> sitchin, youhave an 80 gig drive?
[02:22] <sitchin> yes
[02:23] <sitchin> but the mounting screen does see the partitions
[02:23] <coz_> sitchin, yes it sometimes says that, however if it wa partitioned correctly it should show the partitions
[02:23] <sitchin> and thats where i'm doing something wrong (mounting screen)
[02:23] <MattJ> navaladi__: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.html#options
[02:23] <MattJ> navaladi__: You need to add the FollowSymlinks
[02:23] <coz_> sitchin, apparently you need to allocate a root partition for the system to begin the install
[02:23] <sitchin> the '/' right
[02:24] <sitchin> or \
[02:24] <coz_> sitchin, let me look online for the best way to solve this hold on
[02:24] <sitchin> cool thanks
[02:24] <sitchin> :)
[02:24] <navaladi__> MattJ - but the target filesystem files r not readable by others what to do..u under?
[02:25] <MattJ> navaladi__: It's the same on my FAT32 partition
[02:25] <navaladi__> MattJ - so it does not matter..let me c
[02:26] <MattJ> navaladi__: I'm just restarting my server
[02:26] <coz_> sitchin, one thing youcan do is to reinstall the windows MBR through the recovery disc
[02:26] <coz_> sitchin,  this wway you should be able to boot into windows and recover the data
[02:27] <sitchin> what is MBR?
[02:27] <coz_> sitchin, MBR is the master boot record for windows
[02:27] <sitchin> i only have a windows xp install disk
[02:27] <coz_> sitchin, I will look for clear how to on that
[02:28] <coz_> sitchin, right that is how you install the mbr also
[02:28] <coz_> sitchin, hold on
[02:28] <sitchin> oh ok :)
[02:28] <navaladi__> MattJ - no it is set already but not working because the target file is not readble
[02:29] <navaladi__> MattJ - how to make readable for others
[02:29] <babo> my sound doesn't work ...
[02:30] <coz_> sitchin, if you put in the xp cd there will be an option to reapair the system follow the directions druing this
[02:30] <sitchin> ok i'll try
[02:30] <sitchin> thanks
[02:31] <drayen> is there a gnome equiv of katapult?
[02:31] <navaladi__> MattJ - dude can u get the probelm?
[02:31] <coz_> sitchin, now if that fails do not do anything to the hard drive, find someone who will let youconnect your hard drive up by wya of usb into their system, youcan then simply copy your files to a cd
[02:31] <drayen> come back to ubuntu from K and i miss it
[02:31] <MattJ> navaladi__: It doesn't work for me
[02:32] <navaladi__> MattJ - for u also not working?
[02:32] <MattJ> navaladi__: Nope :/
[02:32] <felixjet> !GTK
[02:32] <ubotu> gtk is the gimp toolkit, which forms the base of Gnome and a lot of other applications

[03:06] <SirKillalot> for you?
[03:06] <boink> what does apt-cache search say?
[03:06] <gary_> Is mysql-server-5 available for breezy badger.  I'm having trouble finding it
[03:07] <SirKillalot> the package is available
[03:07] <compudaze> installed fine for me

[03:07] <SirKillalot> I'll check my repos
[03:07] <boink> is mysql-server-5 even avalaible for breezy?
[03:07] <cw_asmara> dip
[03:08] <tony__> xd45, no command line output on #alsa and no sound.
[03:08] <SirKillalot> compudaze, could you nopaste your sources.list?
[03:08] <compudaze> nopaste?
[03:08] <Terminus> !paste | compudaze
[03:08] <ubotu> compudaze: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[03:08] <xd45> no tony__ try the channel #alsa
[03:08] <boink> SirKill: for which distro?
[03:08] <gary_> boink: That's what I mean really.  All I keep finding is mysql-server-4.1
[03:08] <boink> gary: then it's not available for breezy
[03:08] <SirKillalot> boink, ubunt edgy
[03:08] <gary_> I'm starting to think I'll have to just download the source and install it manually
[03:08] <tony__> xd45, aah thx!
[03:08] <[A] ndy80> don't know if edgy has broken packages, I only know for sure that it has a lot of troubles when you try to dist-upgrade from dapper :(
[03:08] <Hobbsee> [A] ndy80: depends what you install in dapper
[03:09] <Hobbsee> [A] ndy80: but yes, it can be terrible
[03:09] <SirKillalot> compudaze, I mean paste it here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[03:09] <gary_> mysql-server-5.x is available for edgy.  Can you somehow use it's packages too?
[03:09] <boink> it's available for dapper too
[03:09] <boink> just upgrade to dapper
[03:09] <boink> really, breezy is ooold
[03:09] <sjanes71x> google earth broke for me in edgy. i kind of regret upgrading. :/
[03:09] <compudaze> sirkillalot: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31444/
[03:09] <gary_> How do you upgrade to dapper - do apt-get dist-upgrade?
[03:09] <boink> !upgrade
[03:09] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic") - See also !downgrade
[03:10] <coz_> gary i would suggest not doing an upgrade from dapper to edgy
[03:10] <boink> just follow the documentation
[03:10] <boink> but doing one from breezy to dapper should be fine
[03:10] <xd45> I went from dapper to edgy fine

[03:18] <LordMetroid> yeah
[03:18] <LordMetroid> ahh there is a command function that is ssh
[03:18] <nette> compudaze, okai.. because im reading on the ubuntu wiki and they use sudo and gksudo in for various things and i can't quite get it.. and all that is in a command shell
[03:19] <compudaze> using gksudo is a command shell will bring up a window asking for your passwd to continue
[03:19] <oiec> MattJ: in xfce is available that panels from here ? http://memux.neuf.fr/screenshots/xfce_02.png

[03:20] <LainNaomi> can anyone please help me with a small c question?
[03:20] <gary_> How can I find out easily what version of ubuntu I am using?
[03:20] <Graffiti> doesnt gksudo always ask for password?

[03:41] <LabThug> AsheD, BCC stands for Blind Carbon Copy.  It's a way to send mails without the others knowing it went to that person.  Some people BCC the replies to themselves so they can keep a copy.

[04:03] <znejk> :)
[04:03] <boink> try df -h
[04:03] <Poromenos>  
[04:03] <Poromenos> err
[04:03] <Poromenos> oh hmm
[04:04] <Poromenos>  /dev/sda2, but i can't cd to it
[04:04] <micktm> hi!
[04:04] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, man mount
[04:04] <boink> what does /etc/fstab say?
[04:04] <MattJ> Poromenos: /media/sda2
[04:04] <Poromenos> MattJ: nope :/
[04:04] <MattJ> Poromenos: Type mount
[04:04] <needhelp> Poromenos: type: mount | grep "sda2"
[04:04] <micktm> when I watch a video in fullscreen mode, it seems much slower woth 6.10 than with ubuntu 6.06! someone knows why^
[04:05] <Poromenos> boink: it gives me the uuids
[04:05] <MercuryMan> I'm running an ATI video card (it's not mine, but my dad's) and I've followed the how-to for getting Beryl/xgl working with it, and nothing. I've got 3D rendering working well, but it basically tells me there is no composite extension when I try to run beryl-manager... What else do I need to add to me xorg.conf besides Option  "Composite" "Disable" ?
[04:05] <Daviey> Hi,can anybody tell me how to autocomplete in openoffice?
[04:05] <boink> then sda2 probably isn't mounted
[04:05] <Poromenos>  /dev/sda2 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
[04:05] <co_cool> how hack server ubuntu
[04:05] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, are you familiar with the consept ofmounting drives?
[04:05] <boink> co_cool: with gcc :)
[04:05] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: somewhat
[04:05] <MattJ> lol :D
[04:05] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, then whats your question?
[04:05] <boink> you could use perl, if you're lazy
[04:05] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: how i can cd to my drive
[04:05] <needhelp> Poromenos: then you are already in sda2
[04:06] <Poromenos> hmm
[04:06] <Poromenos> ah, i see
[04:06] <Poromenos> actually i need to format my other drive
[04:06] <Poromenos> that's why i wanted to access it
[04:06] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, you said you where familiar with the concept of mounting, and therefore you should know that / is sda2
[04:06] <needhelp> that other drive is not sda2
[04:06] <Poromenos> needhelp: agree
[04:06] <Poromenos> sdb, probably
[04:06] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: in my other pc, the drives are in /dev/hd*
[04:06] <needhelp> type: mount
[04:06] <Poromenos> so i was wondering why they weren't
[04:06] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, sudo apt-get install gparted
[04:07] <Poromenos> needhelp: i don't think it is mounted
[04:07] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: can it format as ntfs?
[04:07] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, sata/scsi is sd*, and pata is hd*
[04:07] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, i ju gave you the command for installing gparted, use it :)
[04:07] <Poromenos> ok
[04:08] <Poromenos> wait, is that graphical?
[04:08] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, you can format in ntfs, but why would you? stay clear of ntfs, unless you have a _very_ good reason to use it. yes gparted is graphical.
[04:08] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i want it to be compatible with windows. i don't have a graphical interface installed
[04:08] <Poromenos> i'll use parted instead
[04:09] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, yes, use parted, and if you want windows compatibility id suggest ext3 and a ext-driver for windows
[04:09] <nolimitsoya> ext2ifs is one
[04:09] <eracc> FYI, the answer to my question earlier is to use [ctrl] d after the last 'at>' prompt.
[04:09] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: hmm
[04:09] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: does that work with external drives? usb?
[04:10] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, yes. an external drive is no different from an internal one
[04:10] <Novise> HELP!Could someone please help me get WiFi up and running on my system??
[04:10] <nolimitsoya> !wifi
[04:10] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[04:11] <Novise> Yeah, I know....but I have a Broadcom 43xx-family card...
[04:11] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i tried the driver at fs-driver.org the other day and i think it couldn't mount it. or maybe that was a vmware drive
[04:11] <Poromenos> anyway, thanks for the help
[04:11] <Poromenos> actually i want ntfs because there are more data recovery tools for it
[04:12] <Novise> Anyone Norway?
[04:12] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, and you are definatly more likely to need them if you use ntfs and linux ;) use ext3, thats all i have to say
[04:12] <charlie> what package are man pages like strcmp and strlen in?
[04:12] <tripppy> after installing ubuntu once , and reinstalling, it now wont boot at all.
[04:12] <jrib> charlie: manpages-dev
[04:12] <charlie> jrib, thank you
[04:12] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i probably will... i did get a corrupt ext3 partition the other day, though
[04:13] <gregbuntu> jokosher
[04:13] <Poromenos> i don't know what the problem was, i think the frequent cold reboots
[04:13] <Poromenos> and it's a company pc so i can't afford to lose data
[04:13] <gregbuntu> anybody tried using jokosher?
[04:13] <felixjet> what hotkey is to open a console ? like F4 in KDE
[04:13] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, thats what backups are for. get hubackup. its in the repos
[04:14] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i had a backup
[04:14] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, then loosing data is not an issue
[04:14] <Poromenos> ext3 will do, i think
[04:14] <Poromenos> i'm writing a python script to backup files, is hubackup better?
[04:14] <Poromenos> ah, that's graphical too
[04:15] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, ah, sorry. i forgot. rsync and a script is probably your best friend
[04:15] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: ah, rsync, nice, thanks :)
[04:16] <Poromenos> actually i'm backing up to a second hard disk, so even copy will do
[04:16] <jrib> felixjet: you cna set on ein system  > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
[04:16] <compengi> does anyone here use frostwire?
[04:16] <mpmc> Anyone tell me how I update to 6.10.. from 6.06?
[04:16] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, that wont cive you incremental backups, tared and zipped
[04:16] <compengi> mpmc, read the topix
[04:16] <compengi> topix
[04:16] <nolimitsoya> *g
[04:16] <compengi> topic*
[04:17] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: does rsync do that?
[04:17] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, with some scriptingwork, yes.
[04:17] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: actually i prefer unzipped backups, you can recover more files if something is damaged
[04:17] <felixjet> jrib: cant :S no option for console
[04:17] <gregbuntu> I'm looking for opinion of jokosher... anybody here tried it?
[04:17] <Poromenos> actually zip should do as well
[04:17] <compengi> jrib, have you ever installed frostwire?
[04:17] <Poromenos> i'll do that, great, thansk
[04:18] <jrib> compengi: yes
[04:18] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: by the way, my other sata drive doesn't get mounted in fstab, how can i get its uuid so i can mount it?
[04:18] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, archives can have redundant data, so thats no problem. tar:s are unzipped as well, and you dont have to zip them. check the wiki, i think there is a guide for rsync backuo somewhere
[04:18] <compengi> jrib, it's not running because it needs java configuration can you help me with it?
[04:18] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, you dont need the uuid
[04:18] <jrib> felixjet: "Run a terminal"  Last option in the "desktop" section
[04:19] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: the other lines are e.g. UUID=eabd31b8-6d86-4ef6-be37-8ebfa1da70e8 /home           ext3    defaults        0       2
[04:19] <jrib> compengi: I'm actually about to leave, but have you installed sun java?
[04:19] <compengi> jrib, i think so
[04:19] <compengi> not sure
[04:19] <felixjet> jrib: Execute in terminal is not the option because i want to open a console in the current location. for example if im on desktop folder and i press that hotkey, the console is not at desktop dir.
[04:19] <jrib> compengi: sudo update-alternatives --config java,  do any of them say sun?
[04:19] <rkelly> can the ti 84 calculator be used on linux
[04:19] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, yes, but you still dont need the uuid. you only need to know where its plugged in, and mount /dev/sd<whatever> instead of the uuid. the uuid can be found with blkid, if you prefer
[04:20] <compengi> jrib, yeah and it's a default of number 2
[04:20] <jrib> felixjet: I don't know how to do that.  You can add it to the right click menu though with nautilus-open-terminal
[04:20] <jrib> compengi: pastebin your error and maybe someone else can help
[04:20] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: aha, hmm, well, it's probably /dev/sdb, so can i format it without it being in the fstab?
[04:20] <Poromenos> yep, it's here, thanks
[04:21] <rkelly> can the ti 84 calculator be used with linux
[04:21] <felixjet> jrib how ?
[04:21] <compengi> jrib, it just doesn't run when i click on it but i remember someone had changed something in java configuration that made it work
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, formating has nothing to do with fstab, but if you reformat and repartition, the uuid will change, so be carefull using uuid:s to mount. its better, imho, tomount using drive designations (/dev/***/)
[04:21] <iUninstall> Hi all
[04:22] <iUninstall> I need help please
[04:22] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i'll do it like that then, i just thought you had to mount using the uuid because of the other fstab entries
[04:22] <nolimitsoya> !help
[04:22] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[04:22] <iUninstall> I removed /etc/fstab
[04:22] <jbroome> rkelly: from what i found on GOOGLE, no
[04:22] <iUninstall> Know Anyone how to recreate it?
[04:22] <Daviey> Hi,can anybody tell me how to autocomplete in openoffice?
[04:22] <compengi> jrib, how to run it from the terminal to see the erro
[04:22] <compengi> error*
[04:23] <rkelly> shitty deal
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, the advantage of mounting with uuid is that you can move disks around freely and still not mess things up. thats why uuid is the default, so less computer savvy people wont run into problems
[04:23] <jrib> felixjet: just install that package: nautilus-open-terminal
[04:23] <Poromenos> aha
[04:23] <jrib> compengi: 'frostwire'
[04:23] <iUninstall> nolimitsoya, Can you help me
[04:23] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: hmm, parted is a bit hard, in that it doesn't tell me the start/end sectors when i create the partition. where can i get those from?
[04:23] <iUninstall> ?
[04:23] <compengi> jrib, frostwire
[04:23] <compengi> runFrost.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[04:23] <micktm> From when i installed ubuntu 6.10, when i watch video files in fullscreen mode, they seems much slower than with 6.06!!
[04:23] <iUninstall> Poromenos, I've removed /etc/fstab
[04:23] <micktm> I installed fglrx drivers...
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> iUninstall, just write a new one using and regular text editor, and save it as fstab
[04:23] <Poromenos> iUninstall: i don't know how, sorry :/
[04:23] <micktm> but nothing changed...
[04:23] <felixjet> jrib okey, ty
[04:24] <jrib> compengi: sudo nano -w /usr/bin/frostwire      change the 'sh' in the last line to a 'bash'
[04:24] <iUninstall> nolimitsoya, And how to recreate the UUID?
[04:24] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, perhaps youdlike to partition in cfdisk/fdisk?
[04:24] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: hmm, okay
[04:24] <nolimitsoya> iUninstall, i just told Poromenosthat you dont have to, but  blkid is your friend :)
[04:24] <compengi> jrib, sh runFrost.sh this one?
[04:24] <Poromenos> ah yes, that's the one, fdisk, thanks
[04:24] <jrib> compengi: yes
[04:24] <jrib> compengi: make it:   bash runFrost.sh
[04:25] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, chdisk or fdisk wont let you format, so youd have to mkfs the right filesystem efterwards
[04:25] <iUninstall> nolimitsoya, How ubuntu installer create it?
[04:25] <nolimitsoya> iUninstall, i dont understand the question
[04:25] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i tried in parted, but it doesn't support ext3
[04:25] <Poromenos> do i mkfs.ext3?
[04:25] <iUninstall> nolimitsoya, Also can you paste your /etc/fstab?
[04:26] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, yes, or mke2fs -j
[04:26] <Poromenos> ok, thanks
[04:26] <Pupbuntoo> hi, I don't know much about this, but I think I need to enable "explicit framebuffer support" for my consoles in the kernel... do i need to compile my own kernel or is there one i can apt-get?
[04:26] <compengi> jrib, it worked thank you
[04:26] <nolimitsoya> iUninstall, just a moment

[04:30] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | rkelly
[04:30] <ubotu> rkelly: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:30] <Novise> Andy80: yes??
[04:30] <Poromenos> Novise:  you could have done apt-get install kubuntu-desktop :(
[04:31] <[A] ndy80> Novise: did you uninstall Ubuntu and installed Kubuntu?
[04:31] <nolimitsoya> Khamael, have you tried?
[04:31] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i have formatted it, should i reboot or anything?
[04:31] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, no
[04:31] <[A] ndy80> Poromenos: I was going to tell him the same thing :D
[04:31] <Poromenos> [A] ndy80: yes :(
[04:31] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i probably need to mount it now, don't i
[04:31] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, if you want touse it, yes
[04:31] <Novise> Andy80: No I had a majojor hd-crash...changed the drive and had to start anew..But now with a K infront!
[04:32] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: ok :)
[04:32] <[A] ndy80> ah ok
[04:32] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: where does this sort of thing usually go? /media/?
[04:32] <Poromenos> or should i make a /dev/sdb1 folder?
[04:32] <Poromenos> err, directory
[04:32] <Novise> But now my f*****g wifi-card won't work so could someone please help me?
[04:33] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, you can mount where ever you please. if you are a single user, i find it easiest to mount in a folder in your home
[04:33] <micktm> how to know XFree86 version??
[04:33] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: ok, thanks a lot
[04:33] <nolimitsoya> !language | Novise

[04:33] <Khamael> nolimitsoya: it says wrong fs type, when I type "sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop file.bin /media/dir/"
[04:33] <drayen> when installing JDK via automatrix, where does it put it?
[04:34] <nolimitsoya> Khamael, then you would probably have to convert it to iso
[04:34] <nolimitsoya> Khamael, try cutting out the -t part
[04:34] <Poromenos> how do i symlink a directory?
[04:35] <jbroome> wow
[04:35] <jimbo> Help......I installed nvidia drivers now I get a "video mode not supported" message on my lcd and I cant see anything in the Ubuntu installation
[04:35] <Khamael> nolimitsoya: must specify filesystem type
[04:35] <wildchild> why when I connect my canon camera to usb and on desktop appears icon: USB imaging interface and when I click on in and upload images to digikam nothing happens :S can someone help me on that
[04:36] <jimbo> How do I get rid of those drivers?
[04:36] <nolimitsoya> Khamael, then its probably not supported
[04:36] <jimbo> any ideas?
[04:36] <nolimitsoya> jimbo, restart the installation?
[04:36] <Khamael> nolimitsoya: I guess I can burn it to a cd with k3b or something
[04:36] <porkpie__> Guy's what is the package name for GD
[04:37] <jimbo> nolimitsoya: i restarted, then nothing but black and that message on the lcd monitor
[04:37] <jimbo> in running from live cd now
[04:37] <porkpie__> gd-2.0.11
[04:37] <kaur> if my laptop's function keys are not working, and i want to make them work, then where is the file i have to add the keycodes to?
[04:37] <jimbo> this sucks...i was finally getting thngs to work
[04:37] <Wodger> if it's cannon it's probably using the standurd inface
[04:37] <Wodger> what camera
[04:38] <jimbo> nolimitsoya: you got any ideas other than re install and start over?
[04:38] <Wodger> other options are to get a card reader
[04:38] <nolimitsoya> jimbo, when you say installation, do you actualy _mean_ installation, or and installed system? please try to be clear when asking questions. anyway, ctrl+alt+f2 in your installed system will get you a terminal. log in, and sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:39] <jimbo> installed system....the operating system that is installed on this computer
[04:39] <nolimitsoya> yes
[04:39] <andy> Kaur, yes, you have always to load the keymap for your keyboard. loadkeys ...
[04:40] <kaur> andy: but where is the file with the keycodes located?
[04:40] <nolimitsoya> porkpie__, have you uncommented all the repos?
[04:40] <porkpie__> nolimitsoya:possibly not
[04:40] <nolimitsoya> kaur, for the graphical system, that would be /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:41] <jimbo> nolimitsoya: ill try what you said...took me a minute to write it down
[04:41] <needhelp> I get "failed to loaded x server" at startup. Whats the command to restore a previous xorg.conf ?
[04:41] <nolimitsoya> porkpie__, sudo nano /etc/apt/source.list
[04:41] <jimbo> i dont know if i can even get to terminal tho
[04:41] <kaur> ok
[04:41] <rkelly> anyone| does anyone use there TI calculator with linux
[04:42] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, just remove the current xorg.conf (sudo rm <etc>), and my the backup in its place. (sudo mv <etc>)
[04:42] <catalytic> anyone here use blender?
[04:42] <A_I_> hi
[04:42] <catalytic> i installed the version from the synaptic package manager
[04:42] <catalytic> but its old
[04:42] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | rkelly
[04:42] <ubotu> rkelly: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:42] <catalytic> so i downloaded the new version from their site, but I cant work out how to installed it properly
[04:43] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: where do i get the backup from? I didnt back it up b4 I messed with it
[04:43] <nolimitsoya> catalytic, check the backport repo
[04:43] <A_I_> why is "status" option not available on many services init-scripts ?
[04:43] <catalytic> how do i add it to my list?
[04:43] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, that was a bad desicion ;) anyway, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:44] <needhelp> thanks :)
[04:44] <nolimitsoya> catalytic, in synaptic, check resources
[04:44] <catalytic> yep
[04:44] <catalytic> repositories?
[04:44] <porkpie__> nolimitsoya:still can find it
[04:45] <andy> the default path will always look at the correct place. use  "loadkeys it"  for italian keyb etc.
[04:45] <nolimitsoya> porkpie__, are you sure its supposed to be inte the repos then? have you checked if its part of a larger package?
[04:45] <jbroome> !info gd-2.0.11
[04:45] <ubotu> Package gd-2.0.11 does not exist in any distro I know
[04:45] <nolimitsoya> catalytic, yes, repositories
[04:46] <catalytic> and do what? tick the check for updates?
[04:46] <porkpie__> http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-2.0.11.tar.gz
[04:46] <Hillslayer> hello
[04:46] <nolimitsoya> catalytic, no, look for something like sources, and edit to add the repos you want
[04:46] <catalytic> i understand how to add repos, i just dont know what one to add
[04:47] <nolimitsoya> catalytic, i cant give you a steb by steb, since i dont have synaptic installed.
[04:47] <porkpie__> maybe I need to compile it my self ...
[04:47] <catalytic> what is backports?
[04:47] <jbroome> !backports
[04:47] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[04:47] <catalytic> a repository?
[04:47] <nolimitsoya> catalytic, the backports repo.

[04:49] <Poromenos> no, with zip
[04:49] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, what do you mean? tar -z pipes the output to gzip
[04:49] <catalytic> :(
[04:49] <catalytic> still the same version of blender
[04:49] <catalytic> 2.41
[04:50] <Poromenos> no, "zip", pkzip
[04:50] <Poromenos> the zip command
[04:50] <iUninstall> nolimitsoya, Now I reboot
[04:50] <catalytic> i have downloaded the latest version 2.42
[04:50] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, man pkzip? though i tink youd do the same as for tar. but why on earth would you want do discard tar and gzip?
[04:50] <catalytic> and can run the program
[04:50] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: compatibility :)
[04:50] <catalytic> but its not installed properly
[04:51] <nn> Anyone know why even with the "restricted" codecs installed, i still cant make k3b do mp3 burning? :(
[04:51] <catalytic> coz when i render and stuff its not linked properly
[04:51] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, that the very reason you shoulduse tar...
[04:51] <Poromenos> it's zip -r <archive> <dir> btw, got it from the man, thanks :)
[04:51] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: how can you fix broken tar archives?
[04:51] <oiec> MattJ: are you here ?
[04:51] <catalytic> how can i fix a broken syslnk?
[04:51] <scot524> I am having some difficulty with poor performance (edgy), especially graphics, on a Sony VGN FS680/W.  Anyone no where to look?
[04:51] <elias_> something totally different: what might ATD mean in a statistic?
[04:51] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, whats that got to do with compatibility?
[04:51] <wrzask> Hi. How can I setup winkey-something shortcuts in GNOME on ubuntu?
[04:51] <catalytic> ie firefox points to an old uninstalled version
[04:51] <wrzask> I want, say, win-1 to launch a terminal.
[04:51] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: there are many tools compatible with pkzip that can fix broken archives
[04:51] <Poromenos> compatibility with windows, i meant
[04:51] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, man pkzip
[04:52] <jbroome> wrzask: system > prefs > keyboard shortcuts
[04:52] <nolimitsoya> in terminal
[04:52] <MattW> Hi
[04:52] <oiec> hello MattW
[04:52] <Trivolt> hello i have a question: is it legal to install ubuntu on a pc, and than sell the pc?
[04:52] <oiec> Trivolt: no, you can share ubuntu.
[04:53] <Poromenos> Trivolt: err, it is, as long as you don't charge for ubuntu
[04:53] <MattW> Does anybody know a quick and easy way of setting my screen resolution to 3840x768 without the system complaining that it's not supproted?
[04:53] <Luakagon> My video player doesn't play videos; instead it just goes through the seconds 12 at a time or so until it gets to the end.  can someone help?
[04:53] <wrzask> jbroome, Doesn't work. I tried different keyboard settings (winkeys mapped to meta, super or hyper), yet when I try to setup that shortcuts it is resolved as '<Mode4><Hyper>1', which simply doesn't work.
[04:53] <nn> MattW, edit /etc/X11/x.org
[04:53] <MattW> I've been trying a virtual definition in there, doesn't seem to be working
[04:53] <iUninstall> nolimitsoya, OK. Works. Thanks
[04:54] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, you can always charge for ubuntu, as you can any other gpl software
[04:54] <Trivolt> Poromenos: What if I make a piece of hardware (embedded, slotmachine) and develop software for the hardware, but using the ubuntu distro?
[04:54] <LinuxTitan> howdy.. I'm on ubuntu-ce and it seems it is setup to block cookies
[04:54] <Juhaz> wrzask, what is <Mode4> supposed to represent?
[04:54] <LinuxTitan> how can I change this? (is it dansguardian? tinyproxy? clamav?)
[04:55] <nolimitsoya> Trivolt, you can always charge money for gpl software
[04:55] <wrzask> Juhaz, No idea, it just goes in there when I press 'winkey+1'.

[04:59] <nolimitsoya> wastrel, this is not about gpl in general. the question whas what rules applied when developing for/with ubuntu

[05:00] <wastrel> nolimitsoya:  that's offtopic, this channel is dedicated to technical support
[05:00] <daxxar> I have this SD-card-reader, and it is detected and finds my card, but I have no clue what device that represents the card. dmesg says: "tifm_7xx1: sd card detected in socket 1" - any suggestions?
[05:00] <nolimitsoya> wastrel, i stand corrected :)
[05:00] <MattW> In my xorg.conf I have added a Modeline for the extended monitor, and added it to the modes in the screens section, but I can't select it.  What have I missed out?
[05:00] <wastrel> scot524:  your graphics probably needs 3d acceleration enabled.  check the binary driver howto on the wiki, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/

[05:01] <anamamec> hola
[05:01] <MattJ> Hello anamamec
[05:01] <needhelp> Help! I cant start X. When typing "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" I get the error "no X server known for your video hardware"
[05:01] <soundray> daxxar: if that doesn't help, run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and follow the messages while you insert the card.
[05:02] <nuts`> hi folks =)
[05:02] <daxxar> soundray, sda is my normal disk, sdb doesn't exist.
[05:02] <soundray> daxxar: 'sudo fdisk -l' might also give you a clue
[05:02] <anamamec> spanins?
[05:02] <Hillslayer> hello
[05:02] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg ubuntu-desktop
[05:02] <daxxar> soundray, I've tried fdisking some promising ones, but no good results yet. I'll try the syslog thing. :-)
[05:02] <nuts`> I got Ubuntu Dapper installed and just want to to a clean reinstall with Edgy Eft.. whats the best way to do it?!
[05:02] <Hillslayer> can anyone explain me what this chan's talking about please?
[05:02] <nuts`> I also got a partition with windows
[05:02] <LinuxTitan> eh so no one could help me?
[05:02] <MattJ> !ubuntu | Hillslayer
[05:02] <ubotu> Hillslayer: Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuHowCome
[05:02] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, backup /home, and format /
[05:02] <daxxar> All I get in syslog is the "Nov 13 17:02:38 localhost kernel: [17181522.856000]  tifm_7xx1: sd card detected in socket 1
[05:03] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: please repeat, I closed the window...
[05:03] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg ubuntu-desktop
[05:03] <Hillslayer> can i play windows games on it?
[05:03] <soundray> Hillslayer: enter '/topic' and it'll tell you
[05:03] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: hum yea, well can I just use the CD BOOT loader and install it on the Linux EXT3 partition?
[05:03] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: thanks
[05:03] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: Im frightened to loose the bootmanager, with the windows partition within it
[05:03] <cyzie> to all xgl lovers, to run it, follow this links http://customisinglife.wordpress.com/2006/11/02/xubuntu-edgy-xgl-and-beryl/
[05:05] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, thats no problem, since the installation will probably find your windows partition, and set things up for you. otherwise, you can do it manualy afterwards, or reinstall the windows boot loader before reinstalling ubuntu. (fixboot fixmbr in the recovery console of windows xp) besides, you can backup your grub configuration in /boot, and modify for edgy later
[05:06] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, a partition does not reside within your boot manager. a boot manager is just a program that boots your os
[05:07] <bkudria> Could someone help me and tell me how to set up a vpn connection to relakks.com ?  https://www.relakks.com/faq/guides/connectionmanual/

[05:07] <ubotu> From more information on vpn please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gaming_VPN_Using_PPTPD
[05:07] <Satine> hi!
[05:07] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: thank you big time..:)
[05:07] <soundray> Hillslayer: if you *only* want to play games, I'd recommend you stick with Windows. If you want a free (as in speech) alternative operating system, Ubuntu is a great way to start.
[05:08] <bkudria> nolimitsoya: ok, thanks!
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, np :)
[05:08] <Satine> how can i get a copy of ubuntu?
[05:08] <Satine> (if someone speaks spanish, it would be better)
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> Satine, download from www.ubuntu.com, or order one through shipit
[05:08] <Wodger> download it from ubuntu.org
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> !es
[05:08] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[05:08] <soundray> !download | Satine
[05:08] <ubotu> Satine: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[05:08] <soundray> !shipit | Satine
[05:08] <ubotu> Satine: shipit is is a service that sends free Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu CDs. See http://shipit.ubuntu.com/ and http://shipit.kubuntu.org and http://shipit.edubuntu.org  -  Shipit will not send Edgy (6.10) CDs, but only Dapper (6.06) CDs, as Dapper is a Long Term Support release.
[05:08] <Satine> thanks!!!!
[05:08] <bkudria> nolimitsoya: hmm, that's how to set up a server, not a client.  i need to connect to a vpn server
[05:08] <pvt_harv> Satine: yes u can, just visit shipit.ubuntu.com
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> Satine, np :)
[05:09] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: I still get error when typing startx: no screens found
[05:09] <pvt_harv> hi there
[05:09] <ortega10> my proprietary ati drivers are not working since i upgraded to edgy... glxgears demo is not accelerated, and fglrxinfo says " Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0" "... what can i do?
[05:09] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: I did apt-get install xserver-xorg ubuntu-desktop, but X wont start
[05:10] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, then your xorg.conf is not set up properly. as a quick fix, revert to vesa driver
[05:10] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, could alsobe you dont have the proper driver installed
[05:10] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: well, it worked just fine before I tried to install my new mouse....
[05:10] <nuts`> hum which ubuntu windowmanager is bestrated atm?
[05:11] <soundray> ortega10: did your upgrade run through all the way? Check with 'sudo apt-get -f install'
[05:11] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: I tried to change xorg.conf to install the new cordless mouse
[05:11] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, wm is a personal preference. i like vanilla xfce, others lika other things :)
[05:11] <soundray> nuts`: metacity is the ubuntu default
[05:11] <ortega10> soundray: i think it did (at least it didn't show any errors or warnings), but i'll check with that
[05:11] <ekimus> can masquerade certain source+destination address combination? like from 10.0.2.0/24 to 10.0.1.0/24 thru eth1 and from 10.0.2.0/24 to any thru eth0?
[05:11] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: it doesnt matter which ubuntu distr. I install, I can change wm easyli anyway right
[05:12] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, yes. if you want a totaly custom system, do a command line install with the alternate install cd
[05:12] <bkudria> nolimitsoya: hmm, that's how to set up a vpn server, not a client.  i need to connect to a vpn server
[05:12] <ortega10> soundray: it says "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded"
[05:12] <ekimus> nuts`:  yes, like apt-get install kubuntu -> kde desktop (if you installed standard ubuntu)
[05:12] <nolimitsoya> bkudria, then im not the guy to talk to :)
[05:12] <bkudria> nolimitsoya: oh. ok
[05:13] <bkudria> Could someone help me and tell me how to set up a vpn connection to relakks.com ?  https://www.relakks.com/faq/guides/connectionmanual/  i need to set up a client to connect to their server, and i cannot figure it out.
[05:13] <ortega10> my proprietary ati drivers are not working since i upgraded to edgy... glxgears demo is not accelerated, and fglrxinfo says " Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0" "... what can i do ?
[05:13] <soundray> ortega10: good. Do a 'grep fglrx /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep -i driver'. Is there any output?
[05:13] <soundray> ortega10: don't repeat please, I'm on your case
[05:14] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, in fact, installing the ubuntu-dekstop, xubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop drags in a lot of software that you might notwant/need, and it sets up a lot of customizations you might not want either. apt-get install kde (or kde-core) will do just fine
[05:14] <ortega10> soundray: it says Driver "fglrx"
[05:14] <needhelp> Help! I cant start X. I've tried "apt-get install xserver-xorg ubuntu-desktop", but I still get error when typing startx: (EE) no screens found - Fatal server error: no devices fond
[05:14] <kestaz> don't repeat!
[05:14] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, so will apt-get install gnome, apt-get install xfce, apt-get instal fluxbox,and so on
[05:14] <soundray> ortega10: what about 'lsmod | grep fglrx'?
[05:15] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, as i said, try reverting to vesa, and then get your drivers set up properly
[05:15] <ortega10> soundray: it shows nothing ...
[05:15] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: I tried to select VESA manually, but still same result...
[05:15] <pod> hello
[05:15] <nolimitsoya> needhelp, does the screen section of xorg.conf look ok?
[05:15] <richy_> I just installed apache but where can i chance the default folder to my homedir?
[05:15] <pvt_harv> nolimitsoya: i think it would be better to just apt-get kubuntu-desktop, apt-get xfce-desktop, or apt-get ubuntu-desktop
[05:15] <usuario> virrrrlly
[05:15] <needhelp> nolimitsoya: I did select vesa with dpkg-reconfigure
[05:16] <ortega10> soundray: my bad, it shows this: fglrx                 406988  0

[05:25] <pvt_harv> okies, torpedo, got you point. i guess ur correct. tried it here too
[05:25] <soundray> ortega10: then you haven't... :)
[05:25] <MattJ> needhelp: Post your xorg.conf to pastebin
[05:25] <MattJ> !paste > needhelp
[05:26] <ortega10> soundray: it's not installed now
[05:26] <soundray> ortega10: what do you get from 'dpkg -l linux-restricted*' (pastebin)
[05:27] <ortega10> soundray: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31463/
[05:27] <richy_> torpedo|dog here: sec i edited availble not enabled :P
[05:27] <gsuveg> can i sync my phone with calendar via bt ?
[05:28] <ortega10> soundray: i just tried to install ubuntu-desktop, and seems like i don't have the linux headers installed  :/
[05:28] <torpedo|dog> richy_: the one in enabled is a link to the one in "available"
[05:28] <soundray> ortega10: the headers have nothing to do with your dri problem, though
[05:28] <richy_> torpedo|dog here: let me paste it then one moment
[05:28] <ortega10> soundray: ok
[05:28] <torpedo|dog> richy_: goodo
[05:30] <soundray> ortega10: I suggest you try fixing your upgrade. It may be difficult, because upgrades aren't designed to work  when none of the -desktop packages are installed.
[05:30] <richy_> torpedo|dog here: http://pastebin.com/823345
[05:30] <Paddy_EIRE> what would be the best free video conversion tool for ubuntu
[05:30] <ortega10> soundray: how do i do that?
[05:30] <soundray> ortega10: would it be terrible to backup your home and do a fresh install?
[05:30] <boink> Paddy: mencoder
[05:30] <ortega10> Paddy_EIRE: avidemux probably
[05:30] <ortega10> soundray: i think it would  :)
[05:30] <ortega10> soundray: i have lots of apps installed
[05:31] <boink> soundray: not at all
[05:31] <Paddy_EIRE> ortega10: thx man, I think I already have that installed
[05:31] <boink> maybe you'll need your home
[05:31] <soundray> boink: only ortega10 would know the answer to my question in this case ;)
=== malt is now known as booze
=== booze is now known as boozey
[05:31] <ortega10> soundray: what if i uninstalll the proprietary ati drivers, revert to vesa or whatever, then install them again?  could that work?
[05:31] <torpedo|dog> richy_: did you do "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload"?
[05:32] <malex`> dunno
[05:32] <boink> heh
[05:32] <Paddy_EIRE> soundray: what type of ati card are you using
[05:32] <soundray> ortega10: try and install all ubuntu-desktop dependencies first. At the moment you have a hybrid system between dapper and edgy
[05:32] <ortega10> soundray: ok i will
[05:32] <soundray> Paddy_EIRE: I'm not using an ATI card.
[05:32] <torpedo|dog> richy_: and is there a "Listen" anywhere?
[05:32] <Paddy_EIRE> ortega10: what type of ati card u using
[05:33] <soundray> ortega10: after that, there's a good chance that your approach via VESA will work
[05:33] <ortega10> Paddy_EIRE: radeon 9600 pro
[05:33] <richy_> torpedo|dog listen? in apache2.conf or default.?
[05:33] <soundray> Paddy_EIRE: check out his Xorg log at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31463/
[05:33] <Paddy_EIRE> ortega10: got just the guide
[05:33] <ortega10> soundray: do i have to do anything special to downgrade to vesa, or just uninstalling fglrx will work?
[05:33] <Paddy_EIRE> ortega10: worked for my radeon 9250
[05:34] <torpedo|dog> richy_: put Listen 80 on the very top of "default".
[05:34] <torpedo|dog> then do "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload"
[05:34] <soundray> ortega10: first, 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and set to VESA, then do the reinstall
[05:34] <plesnivec> where is defined which services will be started??
[05:34] <Paddy_EIRE> ortega10: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
[05:34] <soundray> ortega10: have you got the wiki instructions?
[05:35] <ortega10> soundray: which instructions?
[05:35] <soundray> ortega10: Paddy_EIRE has helpfully linked you to them
[05:35] <richy_> torpedo|dog can u check http://sukel.kicks-ass.net
[05:35] <OsloNorway> :) Hello..Could someone help me get wireless networking up and jogging on my system?I'm new to linux, and right now I'm thinking of just installing windows again...Can't get the darn thing to work...:(
[05:35] <ortega10> soundray: oh those
[05:35] <torpedo|dog> richy_: you = winner
[05:35] <torpedo|dog> :)
[05:36] <boozey> yo, whats the best linux os for a server thats easy to use and that don't come with alot of crap at the startup?
[05:36] <soundray> OsloNorway: wireless still causes problems for free OSs because the manufacturers are behaving stupidly
[05:36] <nolimitsoya> !wifi | OsloNorway
[05:36] <ubotu> OsloNorway: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:36] <MattJ> boozey: Ubuntu :D
[05:36] <swoop> hi
[05:36] <jikanter> When I look at my list of partitions, it appears that I have one too many disks. What is my disk doing that it registers as two partitions?  Does this have something to do with LVM?  The name of the partition is 0ATA_ST3500641AS_Linux_ATA-SCSI_simulator. or does this have to do with the artificial 32-bit support?
[05:36] <swoop> if i have a laptop with Core 2 Duo cpu .. which version of Ubuntu should i use ?
[05:36] <soundray> OsloNorway: with ubotu's advice you should get somewhere though
[05:36] <plesnivec> where is defined which services will be started??
[05:36] <swoop> 32 bit or 64 bit ```
[05:36] <swoop> ?
[05:36] <jikanter> swoop: use the 64bit edition
[05:37] <OsloNorway> soundray: Yes, so I've been told..I've read the manual up and down, but still I can't figure it out!
[05:37] <swoop> jkanter: and there is no special problems with the 64 bit edition ?
[05:37] <soundray> swoop: use the 32bit edition if you want to avoid problems
[05:37] <ortega10> soundray: but those instructions are for the open source radeon driver, not the proprietary one i'm using ...
[05:37] <richy_> torpedo|dog well iam a real winner if this one works aswell: http://intoxication.kicks-ass.net
[05:37] <swoop> uhmm now you are confusing me ;) ! :D
[05:37] <soundray> swoop: use amd64 if you want the last bit of performance
[05:37] <jikanter> nope, I am using it right now
[05:37] <torpedo|dog> richy_: already checked, it does ;)
[05:37] <soundray> ortega10: okay...
[05:37] <swoop> not amd64 .. it's intel
[05:37] <soundray> !ati | ortega10
[05:37] <ubotu> ortega10: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:37] <swoop> TI's an Acer laptop .. nvidia 7600 go gfx card
[05:37] <jikanter> oh, I am running amd
[05:37] <swoop> mostly intel compenents
[05:37] <nolimitsoya> swoop, its still the same. though, use 32bit to stay clear of trouble
[05:38] <richy_> torpedo|dog its 2 diffrent sites.. o man harm rox
[05:38] <swoop> but will i get a big performance penalty if i run 32 instead of 64 ??
[05:38] <GaBBaGandalf|wok> hello guys... i need a liitle help :(
[05:38] <soundray> swoop: I know. Still, the EM64T (Intel) platform is supported by the Ubuntu architecture that is designated as 'amd64'
[05:38] <jikanter> There are a couple of things that dont work, but it is very stable
[05:38] <torpedo|dog> richy_: and they do indeed look different :)
[05:38] <OsloNorway> Anyone who has the bcm4318 chipset who can tell me how to get it working?
[05:38] <MattJ> jikanter: What exactly doesn;t work?
[05:39] <GaBBaGandalf|wok> how to install the ubuntu cd without starting the live CD (not starting the graphic interface)
[05:39] <swoop> i mostly curious about performance.. i bought the new laptop so i could game a little, and also so i could run some beryl ect
[05:39] <jikanter> I am having a hard time with some openGL stuff
[05:39] <plesnivec> where is defined which services will be started??
[05:39] <nolimitsoya> GaBBaGandalf|wok, alternate install cd
[05:39] <soundray> OsloNorway: how is it connected -- PCIe?
=== GaBBaGandalf|wok is now known as GaBBaGandalf
[05:39] <pvt_harv> GaBBaGandalf|wok: use the alternate cd or the server cd
[05:39] <GaBBaGandalf> nolimitsoya, how to?
[05:39] <GaBBaGandalf> the server
[05:39] <jikanter> but I think it is just not supported yet perhaps on this architecture....maybe.
[05:40] <OsloNorway> soundray: I guess so!It's a laptop...
[05:40] <nolimitsoya> GaBBaGandalf, download it from the ftp. server and alternate install cd, is not the same thing
[05:40] <swoop> i guess i can give 64 bit a try first ...
[05:40] <swoop> see how it workds... hope everything is running nicely :D
[05:40] <wastrel> is maildir going to break if i start moving mail files around on the command line?
[05:40] <swoop> thanks for the help :D
[05:40] <swoop> gonna come jumping in here when i mess up something :)
[05:40] <GaBBaGandalf> hm.. where to get the alternate install cd?
[05:40] <jikanter> It could not hurt, and then you will have a basis for comparison
[05:40] <soundray> OsloNorway: I've heard that the Broadcom PCIe cards aren't supported in current stable kernels because of a PCIe issue.
[05:41] <nolimitsoya> GaBBaGandalf, i told you, on the ubuntu ftp
[05:41] <nolimitsoya> !alternate
[05:41] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[05:41] <GaBBaGandalf> ok.. thx
[05:41] <soundray> OsloNorway: this is just a workaround, but I suggest you buy a USB wifi dongle that is definitely supported.
[05:41] <pvt_harv> GaBBaGandalf: for a barebone install, use the server cd
[05:41] <nolimitsoya> pvt_harv, no, thats what the alternate cd is for
[05:41] <GaBBaGandalf> its an old P3 500
[05:42] <GaBBaGandalf> just as a webserver
[05:42] <GaBBaGandalf> ^^
[05:42] <OsloNorway> Soundray: Hmmm...But you c it worked fine with another distro! I got help here the last time I tried Ubuntu...So I tried again!:)
[05:42] <nolimitsoya> GaBBaGandalf, for a bare minimum install, or a non graphical installation environment, the alternate install cd is your friend
[05:42] <ortega10> soundray: well i'll try to do that, thanks a lot for your help
[05:42] <soundray> OsloNorway: in that case, there is hope -- it might not be the PCIe version after all. Did you other distribution use ndiswrapper or a native driver?
[05:43] <GaBBaGandalf> ok.. thx
[05:43] <GaBBaGandalf> i still search for it at the ft
[05:43] <GaBBaGandalf> ftp
[05:43] <Abbot> how do i delete ubuntu?
[05:43] <Abbot> ?
[05:43] <skymarshall14> hello
[05:43] <soundray> ortega10: hope it works. Remember, reinstalling might not be so bad if you backup /home and /etc
[05:44] <skymarshall14> i am using an ATI Radeon 9200 card in my eMac, and I can't get ubuntu 6.06 lts to boot
[05:44] <ortega10> soundray: ok i'll remember, thanks a lot and goodbye
[05:44] <soundray> ortega10: and your /var/cache/apt/archives/*
[05:44] <GaBBaGandalf> nolimitsoya, do you have the name of the file, or where it is locatet?
[05:44] <ortega10> Paddy_EIRE: thanks to you too
[05:44] <skymarshall14> i get an error mentioning the xorg.conf file
[05:44] <soundray> ortega10 good luck
[05:44] <skymarshall14> does anyone have any ideas
[05:44] <skymarshall14> ?
[05:44] <soundray> Abbot: you format the partition where it is installed.
[05:44] <Paddy_EIRE> ortega10: no probs :)
[05:44] <OsloNorway> Soundray: We installed ndiswrapper and a windows driver I think, but since I'm not a linux-brainiac I can't seem to get it working under Kubuntu that I've now installed!
[05:44] <kitche> skymarshall14: past your error that you get
[05:45] <felixjet> how can i do to close a window by double-clicking in the left up corner of the window?
[05:45] <soundray> OsloNorway: have you looked at the ubuntu-specific ndiswrapper instructions?
[05:45] <soundray> !ndiswrapper | OsloNorway
[05:45] <ubotu> OsloNorway: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:45] <skymarshall14> k
[05:45] <skymarshall14> i'll just get the error
[05:46] <OsloNorway> Soundray: I've been reading all about both Ndiswrapper and the native driver install, but I guess I'm dense cause I can't figure it out...
[05:47] <soundray> OsloNorway: I'm sure you're too hard on yourself ;)
[05:47] <soundray> OsloNorway: I admit it's much more difficult than it should be, but again, the manufacturers are responsible for that.
[05:47] <ortega10> soundray: installing ubuntu-desktop (and its dependencies) did the trick!  thanks a lot!
[05:48] <OsloNorway> Soundray:Haha...I'm beginning to doubt my skills!But do u know ANY way to get this up and running?
[05:48] <soundray> ortega10: that was quick
[05:48] <ortega10> soundray: yeah i rebooted and all  :P
[05:48] <skymarshall14> i have no way of copying the error
[05:48] <skymarshall14> and it is really long
[05:48] <Abbot> how do i delete
[05:49] <Abbot> ubuntu?
[05:49] <boink> delete what?
[05:49] <soundray> OsloNorway: give me a minute
[05:49] <Abbot> the os
[05:49] <Abbot> remove it
[05:49] <felixjet> how can i do to close a window by double-clicking in the left up corner of the window?
[05:49] <kitche> Abbot: format the drive
[05:49] <OsloNorway> Soundray: Will do!:)
[05:49] <Abbot> crap
[05:49] <soundray> Abbot: like I told you, you format the partition
[05:49] <Abbot> ooh
[05:49] <Abbot> ok
[05:49] <boink> no OS has an uninstall button
[05:49] <Abbot> where?
[05:49] <boink> c'mon, don't troll here
[05:50] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Hmm...Sorry to bother u, but u helped me install my wireless card the last time I installed Kubuntu on a system...Could u help me again?
[05:50] <soundray> OsloNorway: have you tried to follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[05:51] <soundray> ?
[05:51] <OsloNorway> Soundray:...Yes, I have!
[05:51] <Abbot> i received the live cd is there a way i can get kbuntu?>
[05:51] <kitche> OsloNorway: what's wrong? but I would use ndiswrapper for broadcom since the kernel that ubuntu uses has an exploit in it
[05:52] <soundray> OsloNorway: where do you hit the snag then? Be specific, and someone might know how to get over it.
[05:52] <ragnar_123> a quick one: how do I see the kernel version through the terminal?
[05:52] <boink> uname -a
[05:52] <soundray> ragnar_123: man uname
[05:52] <OsloNorway> Kitche: It's the same thing I experienced last time..The system recognizes the card, but it won't use it...
[05:52] <ragnar_123> thanks
[05:52] <kitche> ragnar_123: uname -r will tel you kernel version uname -a will give you everything
[05:53] <OsloNorway> Soundray: Guess what, I found my saviour from my last encounter with this problem!:) JIPPI
[05:53] <kitche> OsloNorway: umm ok no encryption on the wireless router?
=== eggzeck_ is now known as eggzeck[laptop] 
[05:53] <soundray> OsloNorway: what, that guy? Good luck then. (Just kidding)
[05:54] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Dunno...The card has no driver!!
[05:54] <OsloNorway> Soundray:Haha...
[05:54] <soundray> OsloNorway: scnr
[05:55] <kitche> OsloNorway: you have ndiswrapper installed right do sudo ndiswrapper -l and see what it says should say driver present and hardware present
[05:55] <carlfk_lap> i see my BT mouse in "Bluetooth devices" - how do I make it 'work' ?
[05:56] <litenjacob> i could do with some wireless help too, please :) Be warned - i have a dlink dwl-520+ with the notorious acx100 chip. I got it to connect to my router (FON) when unencrypted, but now, using WEP, i'm out of luck :(
[05:57] <OsloNorway> Kitche:bcmwl5  invalid driver!
[05:58] <rooti1> hi, got a question, is there a way to log in as root so that i can do everything in gnome without bash ?
[05:58] <kitche> OsloNorway: well that pretty much anwsers my question
[05:58] <carlfk_lap> rooti1: if you have to ask, you should't do it :)
[05:58] <soundray> litenjacob: don't use WEP if you're concerned about privacy -- use WPA or run ssh over unencrypted.
[05:58] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Haha..thought so!But now what?
[05:58] <nolimitsoya> rooti1, sudo su
[05:58] <[GuS] > re
[05:58] <rooti1> carlfk_lap: i just want to copy phpmanual
[05:58] <carlfk_lap> litenjacob: hang on... i got a wiki url around here somewhere
[05:58] <DShepherd> what are the extras included in subversion-tools?
[05:59] <litenjacob> soundray: i'd love to, but i can't even get wep to work! Is wpa any easier to configure?
[05:59] <kitche> OsloNorway: what card is it exactly? the name of it
[05:59] <dooglus> rooti1: you can use "sudo nautilus" to get a nautilus running as root
[05:59] <carlfk_lap> rooti1: then use sudo - it is a good habit to learn
[05:59] <litenjacob> carlfk_lap: yeay! :D
[05:59] <OsloNorway> Kitche:Two sec..
[05:59] <soundray> litenjacob: generally not, no, unless you can get it going with network-manager-gnome
[05:59] <jikanter> DSheperd: some bash scripts to do some operations with a repository
[05:59] <kitche> OsloNorway: and the maker of it sicne I m looking at the ndiswrapper device list right now
[05:59] <dooglus> rooti1: or maybe even "gksudo nautilus" or some such
[05:59] <richy_> lo

[06:00] <richy_> i have installed php4 but i want php5, but im using hoary and it cant find the package if i say sudo apt-get install php5
[06:00] <kitche> richy_: it's in edgy I believe
[06:01] <DShepherd> jikanter: hmmm.. are these bash scripts in one place.. I have installed the package just yet
[06:01] <richy_> ier.. does that mean i have to upgrade 20times?
[06:01] <soundray> richy_: you'll have to either upgrade (even better to reinstall) or stick with the old version.
[06:01] <rooti1> dooglus: thx gksudo nautilus was exactly what i was looking for
[06:02] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 (Airforce one 54g) 802,11g Wireless LAN controller (rev 02)..Did I do good?
[06:02] <jikanter> DShepard: Have you installed the package or not?
[06:02] <carlfk_lap> litenjacob: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WPAHowTo - I would skip to near the bottom where it says "Pretty sure "network management framework (GNOME Frontend)"..."
[06:03] <litenjacob> carlfk_lap: thanks! :)
[06:04] <kitche> OsloNorway: ok remove the driver that is in ndiswrapper right now then go to http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List and find your card in there download the .exe unzip the .exe from the bcmwl5.inf and do ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf
[06:04] <slimz> hey guys, im trying to vnc to my home ubuntu pc from a windows xp machine at work, and it wont connect, do the default settings only allow LAN connections?
[06:04] <DShepherd> jikanter: going to do so now..
[06:04] <dooglus> rooti1: I'm not clear whether you want to use "sudo", "gksu" or "gksudo", but experiment with them I guess.
[06:05] <litenjacob> i'll try your tips and hope i won't have to come back ;I
[06:05] <soundray> dooglus, rooti1: always use gksu (=gksudo) with graphical programs. sudo only for cli progs.
[06:05] <zach634> whois soundray
[06:05] <dooglus> soundray: gksu != gksudo
[06:05] <rooti1> dooglus: i wanted to copy files using nautilus in a folder owned by root ... and i dindt want to do it using bash
[06:05] <nolimitsoya> rooti1, sudo is used from a terminal, and gksu or gksudo is used to invoke a graphical password prompt for using programs as su
[06:06] <soundray> zach634: one of the many volunteers trying to help people on the Ubuntu train ;)
[06:06] <zach634> i know...
[06:06] <zach634> messing around in ircII
[06:06] <kitche> rooti1: there should be a root nautilus in System menu
[06:06] <richy_> UPDATING NOW
[06:06] <richy_> :P
[06:07] <richy_> soundray: my old version says i dont have php
[06:07] <zach634> soundray: i still havent gotten that file to work though :P
[06:07] <OsloNorway> Kitche: I'm using the gui ndiswrapper..Makes it any difference, sir?:)
[06:08] <kitche> OsloNorway: no since it's just a wrapper to the one that runs on the console
[06:08] <disposable> where does gnome store user's settings apart from  home directory? i had my desktop settings messed up, so i've ereased all .gconf*, .metacity, .gnome*, .gtk*, .nautilus, but it doesn't seem to be enough.
[06:08] <soundray> zach634: even after you installed ubuntu-desktop?
[06:08] <Jimbo> problem still not resolved
[06:08] <zach634> soundray: well i havent done that yet

[06:09] <huXfluX> HELLO all! I'm trying to run SNORT_INLINE but i get an error message: "while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory". How can i find out WHERE does snort_inline look for that library so I can add it to that directory ?
[06:09] <bliss_> is there a gui or command to see see how much CPU power you are useing
[06:09] <SeamusLP_> Does anyone here know if the audigy 2 zs pcmcia  works in ubuntu?
[06:09] <huXfluX> I do have pcre installed
[06:09] <soundray> zach634: is the file that works identical to the one that doesn't? Maybe do an md5sum on both
[06:09] <kitche> disposable: did you restart gnome?
=== SeamusLP_ is now known as SeamusLP
[06:09] <huXfluX> and that library exists in /usr/local/lib

[06:10] <soundray> bliss_: top in terminal or system-monitor
[06:10] <disposable> kitche: yes, even temporarily emptied my home directory completely to get a fresh configuration
[06:10] <zach634> soundray: um...  there wasnt a file that worked...  i actually tried opening the hldsupdatetool.bin file in pico, saving it under a new file, and attempting to run it again, with no success
[06:10] <Jimbo> i installed nvidia drivers, and after rebooting lcd monitor say video mode not supported. If i put the cd in and select boot from first hd it will boot to the ubuntu installation.  I check boot order in bios and hd 0 is set to boot after cdrom and floppy, as it should be. HELP
[06:10] <gnomefreak> dooglus: change teh time in the bios
[06:10] <kitche> dooglus: umm your date is way off
[06:11] <OsloNorway> Kitche: It now says that the hardware is present, but the name of the driver is b44win
[06:11] <dooglus> kitche: my date is fine: $ date
[06:11] <dooglus> Mon Nov 13 18:11:20 CET 2006
[06:11] <Jimbo> is there any way i can recover to before the nvidia drive screw up?
[06:11] <gnomefreak> dooglus: once the bios time is right it should be synced for you if not you might need to
[06:11] <soundray> zach634: didn't you run it on two machines, where it worked in one and not the other?
[06:11] <richy_> what is the command to get php5
[06:11] <apokryphos> !lamp | richy_
[06:11] <ubotu> richy_: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[06:11] <huXfluX> THANK YOU
[06:11] <dooglus> gnomefreak: I use ntpd, so my clock is correct to a within a few milliseconds
[06:11] <huXfluX> FOR NOTHING
[06:11] <gnomefreak> dooglus: its taking the bios time nad comparing it to gnome/kde time
[06:12] <Luakagon> :o
[06:12] <zach634> soundray: no, it was the same machine, just with ubuntu-desktop installed one time, and now i used ubuntu-server
[06:12] <telmich> hello
[06:12] <kitche> dooglus: that's your software date but your hardware date is off you can sync the hardware date also using date which might help
[06:12] <soundray> dooglus: try sudo -L
[06:12] <dooglus> gnomefreak: my clock is right when I boot without a net connection too, so I have to think the BIOS clock is right too
[06:12] <soundray> dooglus: try sudo -K sry
[06:12] <gnomefreak> dooglus: if your bios says 14:00 and gnome says 18:00 your timestamp is too far ahead
[06:12] <Jimbo> i need a ubuntu expert...or at least someone a hell of a lot more knowledgeable than this n00b
[06:12] <trappist> richy_: sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 should do the trick
[06:12] <kitche> OsloNorway: yeah that's fine
[06:13] <kitche> OsloNorway: see if the wireless works now
[06:13] <richy_> trappist: will this enable php for my apache webserver? and does it work with ubuntu 5.10?
[06:13] <dooglus> soundray: sudo -k fixed it - but how did I get a timestamp 28 days in the future?
[06:14] <porkpie__> how do I run mrtg as a serive
[06:14] <porkpie__> service ?
[06:14] <kitche> dooglus: your bios is probably that far ahead
[06:14] <soundray> zach634: there's a good chance that your pico procedure might have messed it up and compounded the problem.
[06:14] <trappist> richy_: don't know if it'll work for 5.10
[06:14] <soundray> dooglus: I don't know... it happened to me once
[06:14] <dooglus> kitche: no, my BIOS clock is correct
[06:14] <OsloNorway> Kitche: hmm..How?I'm more familiar with Gnome than KDE u c...
[06:15] <dooglus> kitche: I can tell, because when I boot without a network connection, the clock is still correct.
[06:15] <zach634> soundray: probably, but lets worry about that later
[06:15] <felixjet> !sensord
[06:15] <^alien> hi, how can limit folder size not making quotas for user ?
[06:15] <ubotu> sensord: hardware sensor information logging daemon. In component main, is extra. Version 1:2.10.0-7ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 58 kB, installed size 188 kB
[06:15] <bliss_> soundry: there are several under top command Cpu(s)  0.7% us,  0.3% sy,, 0.0% ni,  98.0% id,  0,0% wa, 0.0% hi, 0.04% si   what do they all mean?
[06:15] <richy_> trappist: with what version does it work for sure?
[06:15] <soundray> zach634: well, don't you want to make sure you have a clean program file to start with?
[06:15] <gnomefreak> dooglus: did you reboot after syncing the clock?
[06:15] <trappist> richy_: 6.10
[06:15] <kitche> OsloNorway: well you can make your wireless active then try and go someplace and make it default
[06:15] <der0b> Is anyone seeing gnome hang partially?  I can't determine the cause, but I find that I can't switch windows or desktops, I can move the mouse but it doesn't allow me to click on anything.  I can launch apps via alt+f2 and close apps with alt+f4.  top doesn't show anything running mad.  This is a dell d600 notebook running with wireless through ndiswrapper.  any ideas?
[06:15] <zach634> soundray: i'm not actually at the machine right now, so I cant really do anything, unless I call someone to go turn it on
[06:16] <soundray> bliss_: it's all explained in man top
[06:16] <bliss_> soundray    there are several under top command Cpu(s)  0.7% us,  0.3% sy,, 0.0% ni,  98.0% id,  0,0% wa, 0.0% hi, 0.04% si   what do they all mean?
[06:16] <dooglus> gnomefreak: I didn't sync anything, and I didn't reboot for a day or so
[06:16] <trappist> richy_: something similar will work on 5.10... depends on what versions of apache and php were available for it
[06:16] <Jimbo> after installing nvidia drivers my lcd (only monitor i got with a kvm switc) says video mode not supported when I try to boot the linux machine without a cd
[06:16] <richy_> trappist: we started at 3.10, were almost at 5.10 now :P will take a while
[06:16] <zach634> soundray: when i get back i'm going to try and download some other executable .bin file and see if that will run
[06:16] <ortega10> how do i make the openoffice quickstarter run on startup?
[06:16] <kitche> dooglus: open up a consoel and type in sudo hwclock and see what it returns
[06:17] <lunaphyte_> why does /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload sometimes take an eternity to run?
[06:17] <soundray> zach634: try saving it to /usr/local/bin and running it without the leading ./
[06:17] <needhel1> How do I enable higher screen resolution?
[06:17] <bliss_> soundray i had a look at man alreadt but cannot find the meaning of "id" under top as in 98.0% id,
[06:17] <zach634> soundray: would i use just 'hldsupdatetool' or 'hldsupdatetool.bin'
[06:18] <soundray> zach634: the latter. Linux doesn't distinguish between different parts of a filename.
[06:18] <scheuri> hi all....I have a problem with adept/synpatic/aptitude...it says that there is already something using the database...seems there is a lock file after the crash I had...how to get rid of it?
[06:18] <next_level> hello, i have this problem when i want to install ubuntu: http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1010/photo002nd7.jpg
[06:18] <boink> use apt-get instead
[06:18] <ortega10> how do i make the openoffice quickstarter run on startup ?
[06:19] <soundray> ortega10: don't repeat so quickly, have some patience with us overworked volunteers
[06:19] <ortega10> soundray: sorry
[06:19] <soundray> ortega10: installing ooqstart-gnome should be enough
[06:19] <kitche> bliss_: it seems to be for idling percentage
[06:19] <shark> hi
[06:19] <ortega10> soundray: it's outdated
[06:19] <OsloNorway> Kitche: No usable wireless devivces detected....
[06:19] <soundray> ortega10: failing that, see if the docs say anything (/usr/share/doc/ooqstart-gnome/*)
[06:19] <shark> im shark
[06:19] <dooglus> kitche: it says "Mon 13 Nov 2006 18:19:48 CET  -0.912067 seconds"
[06:20] <next_level> hello, i have this problem when i want to install ubuntu: http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1010/photo002nd7.jpg
[06:20] <zach634> Here's an unrelated note, if ubuntu had breezy, then dapper, then edgy, now whatever that new one starting with 'F' is, were there ubuntu versions with codenames starting with 'A' and 'C'?
[06:20] <kitche> OsloNorway: so does gtkndiswrapper say the driver is good as well?
[06:20] <breery> how do i mount a flash mp3 player to ubuntu or should it happen automatically?
[06:20] <soundray> ortega10: in that case, just run oowriter from System-Prefs-Session
[06:20] <ortega10> soundray: i didn't need any extra packages in breezy, then it stopped working in dapper, now in edgy it works... but only after starting one of the apps
[06:20] <OsloNorway> Kitche:Come again?
[06:20] <boink> breey: happens automagically
[06:20] <dooglus> zach634: warty, hoary, breezy, dapper, edgy
[06:21] <Jimbo> can anyone help with my driver issue or am i gonna have to re install from scratch again?
[06:21] <ortega10> soundray: how do i run it hidden?
[06:21] <kitche> OsloNorway: does ndiswrapper say driver present, hardware present sicne I know you said it sees the hardware
[06:21] <soundray> zach634: the alphabetization was an afterthought, starting with Dapper Drake
[06:21] <zach634> oh,  so there's no alphabetical scheme there...  dang
[06:21] <bliss_> kitche: ok thanks and idling pertage means what in plain english
[06:21] <oiec> MattJ: finally!!
[06:21] <Jimbo> am i invisible?
[06:21] <kitche> bliss_: processes that are doing nothing
[06:21] <zach634> jimbo: yes
[06:21] <dooglus> zach634: I think the idea of using names in alphabetical order only occurred around the time of dapper...
[06:21] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Yes...But not my wireless network application..
[06:21] <dooglus> zach634: so they'll be in order from now on, I think
[06:21] <soundray> !patience | Jimbo
[06:21] <ubotu> Jimbo: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[06:21] <breery> boink: it wont though it says i need to format but wont give the option
[06:21] <Jimbo> very funy zach
[06:22] <boink> oh
[06:22] <shark> xao
[06:22] <bliss_> kitche: so 98% of my CPU is doing nothing ?
[06:22] <boink> usb flash drives area automagically mounted
[06:22] <ExploWare[NL] > i have a question about a shell script to start Limewire (its delivered by limewire, but I use it in ubuntu)
[06:22] <boink> s/area/are/
[06:22] <dooglus> zach634: so edgy is the 5th release, and starts with the 5th letter
[06:22] <kitche> OsloNorway: try sudo ifconfig wlan0 up or what you thingk your device is since mine is usually wlan0
[06:22] <soundray> Jimbo: give it some time and repeat or rephrase. If someone knows, they'll respond
[06:22] <kitche> bliss_: most likely yes
[06:22] <zach634> dooglus: aha, now it makes sense
[06:22] <ExploWare[NL] > anyone wants to help me with my question
[06:22] <alek> hello I have one Q not connected with ubuntu. "number portability" means when you can transfer phone number to another phone?
[06:22] <compengi> had someone installed realone player on edgy?
[06:22] <Jimbo> soundray....can i pm you?
[06:22] <ortega10> compengi: yes i have
[06:23] <dooglus> alek: to another network I think
[06:23] <kitche> bliss_: when top is open press i and id should shoot up to 100%
[06:23] <compengi> ortega10, can you guild me please?
[06:23] <porkpie__> guy's how do I set a cron job to run every 15 seconds ??
[06:23] <ortega10> compengi: i installed it from the plf repositories, but i believe it's in canonical commercial too
[06:23] <dooglus> porkpie__: cron has a granulatity of 1 minute
[06:23] <bliss_> kitche; strange i run a postfix mail server sending and receivig about 12 000 to 13000 maila s day
[06:23] <ExploWare[NL] > ./runLime.sh: 45: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[06:23] <ExploWare[NL] > while line 45 is:
[06:23] <ExploWare[NL] > potential_java_dirs=(`ls -d1 "$JAVADIR"/j* | sort | tac`)
[06:23] <Jimbo> anyway...u ubstalled nvidia drivers from automatrix and not my lcd wont support the video mode, and i have no display
[06:23] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Device not found..Let me try once more..
[06:23] <Jimbo> i mean i installed
[06:23] <bliss_> mails
[06:23] <compengi> ortega10, it's not in repos
[06:24] <porkpie__> dooglus:what is the syntax for every minute
[06:24] <ortega10> compengi: let me see
[06:24] <needhel1> How do I enable higher screen resolution?
[06:24] <Jimbo> i can get to consol tho
[06:24] <kitche> OsloNorway: it might be named something different like an eth device
[06:24] <Jimbo> but i dont know what to do
[06:24] <dooglus> porkpie__: "* * * * * /path/to/command args"
[06:24] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Yup, it's been named eth1 before..But now..Nada...
[06:24] <Jimbo> if i put in the ubuntu cd and select boot from first hd, i can get to the installed os, but not without the cd
[06:24] <dooglus> porkpie__: see "man 5 crontab" for details
[06:24] <ortega10> compengi: # Canonical Commercial Repository (Opera,Real Player10.. etc)
[06:24] <soundray> Jimbo: automatix tends to mess up systems.
[06:24] <ortega10> deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[06:25] <ExploWare[NL] > nevermind, its solved by changing
[06:25] <ExploWare[NL] >  #!/bin/sh
[06:25] <ExploWare[NL] > into
[06:25] <ExploWare[NL] >  #!/bin/bash
[06:25] <MattJ> oiec: Good luck :)
[06:25] <Jimbo> i checked bios and boot order is cd, floppy, hd0 as it should be
[06:25] <kitche> OsloNorway: try wlan0 just to see if it comes up or you can see what ndiswrapper calls it by looking at /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper
[06:25] <dooglus> porkpie__: of course, you can make the script that's run do something 4 times, sleeping 15 seconds between each time...
[06:25] <nolimitsoya> !automatix | Jimbo
[06:25] <ubotu> Jimbo: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[06:25] <bliss_> kitche yes CPU is very low yet fan on labtop is full bleast
[06:25] <soundray> next_level: this looks to me like wrong jumpers on your drives
[06:25] <bliss_> blast
[06:25] <Jimbo> ive wasted the whole day on this so far and would like to know if i gotta re install the whole mess or not
[06:26] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Did that but nada...Hold on two sec...
[06:26] <next_level> soundray i just putted my dvd into master
[06:26] <next_level> and my HD too
[06:26] <next_level> is this the problem?
[06:26] <soundray> Jimbo: reinstall and don't let automatix ruin it again
[06:26] <kitche> bliss_: the fan problem might be due to the kernel if the kernel isn't setup right fans will keep running at full speed
[06:26] <soundray> next_level: yes. Make your DVD drive the slave, or connect it to the other IDE channel.
[06:26] <next_level> k
[06:26] <bliss_> kitche: any ideas how to stop it
[06:26] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Can't figure this out...I'm about -this- close to install windows....Arghh
[06:27] <netpython> next_level, no unless both are been set as primary master
[06:27] <kitche> bliss_: not really since I never played around with a  laptop
[06:27] <compengi> ortega10, i don't have this in my source list =/
[06:27] <dooglus> bliss_: wedging a paperclip between the blades would stop it
[06:27] <Jimbo> damn...i finally had the network working and i forgot the commands
[06:27] <oiec> MattJ: now i burn the cd :)
[06:27] <dooglus> bliss_: but then the cpu might get a bit too hot
[06:27] <oiec> MattJ: thank you
[06:27] <ortega10> compengi: yeah it doesn't come by default, you have to add it
[06:27] <kitche> OsloNorway: what does /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper say?
[06:27] <soundray> Jimbo: backup your /etc and refer to it when you configure again
[06:27] <OsloNorway> Kitche: How do I look at it?
[06:27] <ftorcues> casillas
[06:27] <Jimbo> soundray: is there no way to fix it with the consol?
[06:27] <bliss_> dooglus: woo your a nutcase for sure
[06:27] <compengi> okay
[06:28] <zach634> bliss_: if it the fan you want to slow down, there's a good chance you could do it in the bios
[06:28] <Jimbo> i can do cntrl alt f2 and get consol
[06:28] <kitche> OsloNorway: you can open up a terminal and do cat /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper
[06:28] <next_level> soundray, can i test now?
[06:28] <compengi> ortega10, this one deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main ?
[06:28] <soundray> Jimbo: there might be, but people here are fed up with rescuing systems that have been ruined by automatix
[06:28] <breery> boink: im gona restart and see what happens, thanks for the help
[06:28] <ortega10> compengi: yeah that one
[06:28] <mabreaux> I keep being disconnected via wireless connections, it is a Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG any suggestions
[06:28] <bliss_> zach634: i am listing
[06:28] <Jimbo> this is my third day on linux
[06:28] <soundray> next_level: what do you mean?
[06:28] <bliss_> listening
[06:28] <Jimbo> how was i supposed to know about automatrix
[06:29] <kitche> mabreaux: any encryption on that connection but it might be due to interference
[06:29] <soundray> Jimbo: you weren't. It's just bad luck. Look at easyubuntu next time
[06:29] <soundray> !easyubuntu | Jimbo
[06:29] <ubotu> Jimbo: easyubuntu is easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/  -  For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[06:29] <netpython> Jimbo, no problem,next time you might prefer to just edit your sources.lst
[06:29] <LjL> uh? i know my joins look so very cool, but :P
[06:29] <mabreaux> kitche: it uses wep
[06:29] <ortega10> compengi: the plf repositories also have realplayer
[06:29] <OsloNorway> Kitche:alias wlan0 ndiswrapper
[06:29] <bliss_> zach634: chances are my head would not fit in the oven
[06:29] <ortega10> compengi: and many other cool packages, some of them of questionable legality in the usa  :)
[06:30] <ortega10> compengi: deb http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf/ edgy-plf free non-free
[06:30] <kitche> OsloNorway: ok well we know it's wlan0 try sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
[06:30] <compengi> ortega10, in my edgy list i don't have plf too
[06:30] <zach634> bliss_: what?
[06:30] <Jimbo> netpython  how do i get to sources list?
[06:30] <netpython> http://www.debianadmin.com/ubuntu-edgy-eft-complete-sourceslist-repository-list-file.html
[06:30] <OsloNorway> Kitche: Jupp..done so..
[06:30] <bliss_> zach634; o sorry just a mental relapse
[06:30] <netpython> Jimbo, sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:30] <kitche> OsloNorway: it didnt say already loaded?
[06:31] <OsloNorway> Kitche: No....
[06:31] <ortega10> compengi: well you might want to add it, it's got some great packages
[06:31] <zach634> bliss_: what exactly is it you want to do?  I wasnt really paying attention...
[06:31] <compengi> ortega10, sudo apt-get install realplayer
[06:31] <compengi> Reading package lists... Done
[06:31] <compengi> Building dependency tree
[06:31] <compengi> Reading state information... Done
[06:31] <compengi> Package realplayer is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[06:31] <compengi> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[06:31] <compengi> is only available from another source
[06:31] <compengi> E: Package realplayer has no installation candidate
[06:31] <bliss_> zach634: turn off the fan
[06:31] <gnomefreak> !pastebin | compengi
[06:31] <ubotu> compengi: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:31] <Jimbo> netpython can i fix it at the sources list some how?
[06:31] <netpython> Jimbo, just uncomment and put universe at the last two lines thats all
[06:31] <compengi> gnomefreak, yeah forgot sorry
[06:31] <ortega10> compengi: i think the package is realplay, so first update your sources then search for it with synaptic or apt-cache
[06:31] <Jimbo> how u uncomment?
[06:31] <kitche> OsloNorway: ok now try it, if it didn't complain then the ndiswrapper didn't get loaded on boot
[06:31] <zach634> bliss_: check your bios then...  this is a laptop, right?  press del or f8 on boot, i dont know
[06:32] <bl4> bliss_: sometimes f2 or f1
[06:32] <oiec> MattJ: when i finish the installation i'll be here, thank you.
[06:32] <zach634> bliss_: there's a chance it would be under power management or fan control
[06:32] <netpython> Jimbo, by removing the "#'
[06:32] <Murrlin> I'm looking for a way to not need root privs to set my time/date
[06:32] <Jimbo> k
[06:32] <bliss_> zach634: or head in the oven  ooups sorry
[06:32] <Murrlin> and, soemthing I could put on my taskbar to synch the timeclock
[06:32] <Jimbo> like i said total m00b top linux
[06:32] <Murrlin> with a buttonpress
[06:32] <OsloNorway> Kitche: No usable devices found....
[06:32] <MattJ> Ok oiec
[06:32] <LjL> Murrlin, no can do, or at least no should do. although setting time/date seems like a "trivial" operation, it really can have serious effects on the system, and that's why only root can do it
[06:33] <compengi> ortega10,  sudo apt-cache realplay
[06:33] <compengi> E: Invalid operation realplay
[06:33] <zach634> bliss_: i still dont understand this whole head in the oven dealy...
[06:33] <LjL> Murrlin, why not consider synchronizing time from an Internet NTP server?
[06:33] <dooglus> Murrlin: install 'ntp' and then your date/time will be automatically corrected all the time
[06:33] <MattJ> compengi: sudo apt-cache search realplay
[06:33] <ortega10> compengi: i guess so, although apt-cache doesn't require sudo i think
[06:33] <Jimbo> neypython...type universe where?
[06:33] <kitche> OsloNorway: .... ok I went though everything that I could
[06:33] <Murrlin> doog, I have this, but it only checks once per hour
[06:33] <MattJ> compengi: No, forget the sudo :)
[06:33] <Murrlin> can I alter that?
[06:33] <Jimbo> i can even type this morning
[06:33] <dooglus> Murrlin: ntpd checks as often as it thinks it needs to.  it works out how much your clock drifts, etc.
[06:33] <kitche> OsloNorway: but one more time since you modprobed ndiswrapper see if you can do sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
[06:34] <zach634> bliss_: and if it's a laptop, you should probably leave that fan blowing as much as it can.
[06:34] <Murrlin> I see
[06:34] <dooglus> Murrlin: don't confuse ntpd with 'ntpdate'
[06:34] <compengi> MattJ, kmplayer-konq-plugins - KMPlayer plugin for KHTML/Konqueror
[06:34] <netpython> Jimbo, have a look at this sources.list http://pastebin.com/823394
[06:34] <LjL> dooglus: ntpdate is just intended to be run manually, correct?
[06:34] <bliss_> zach634; well to be ho nest ubuntu sucks and i am making the beat of a bad job so putting my head in the oven just makes light chatting sorry its a looking at the screen all day that does it
[06:34] <Crankymonky> !seen tsmithe
[06:34] <RR_Fang>  No, eu no vi tsmithe!
[06:34] <Jimbo> k
[06:34] <ubotu> I last saw tsmithe (n=_t_@82-70-109-22.dsl.in-addr.zen.co.uk) 17h 7m 57s ago, quiting: "Tired... never gonna finish my english... LET ME BACK ON #ReactOS!"
[06:34] <dooglus> Murrlin: ntpdate is a one-time program - you run it and it syncs the clock once.  ntpd is better in that it's a daemon that takes care of syncing the clock as often as it needs to.

[06:35] <dooglus> LjL: that's right, whereas ntpd is intended to be run at boot time, and keeps running until you shut down.
[06:36] <rooti1> does anyone use gphpedit ... ? i just put the phpmanual to ... but it doesnt work to use help ... and there is no documentation of gphpedit /usr/share/doc/phpmanual

[06:37] <MattJ> :D
[06:37] <LjL> dooglus: though i guess ntpd, by default, also opens a service for *other* clients to connect to, which might be a security risk. not sure if that's enabled in the ubuntu default configuration though
[06:37] <compengi> gnomefreak, do you have any plf source for edgy so i can get some software like realplayer.... please?
[06:38] <Jimbo> the installation is stil there cus i can get it to boot to it by putting in the cd and selecting boot from first hard drive, and remove the cd and it stillruns
[06:38] <LjL> zach634, well, he spoke portuguese actually, but while i can guess a bit of spanish, i don't feel confident enough to venture into portuguese ;)
[06:38] <netpython> Jimbo, You can use this one, it only adds multiverse http://pastebin.com/823399

[06:38] <Jimbo> it wont boot without the cd tho
[06:38] <gnomefreak> compengi: no plf is down afaik anyway. install it by hand its not hard. there are debs for it
[06:38] <RR_Fang> well, i simply forgot to turn the option off before joining, sorry for the mistake
[06:38] <LjL> dooglus: also Edgy, both on Gnome and KDE (perhaps Dapper as well, dunno) has a "net time sync" option in the clock's preferences - not sure what it uses though
[06:38] <gnomefreak> i dont thing seveas repo has realplayer
[06:39] <gnomefreak> think
[06:39] <Seveas> correct
[06:39] <Seveas> realplayer is in dapper-commercial
[06:39] <gnomefreak> i know i have a .deb for it
[06:39] <Jimbo> netpyton, you mean replace my list with the one you showed me?
[06:39] <netpython> next_level, still conflicts
[06:39] <next_level> netpython, , what do i do?
[06:39] <netpython> Jimbo, yes
[06:39] <Jimbo> will my network passwords stay the same etc?
[06:39] <gnomefreak> compengi: iirc the dapper realplayer is the up-to-date one it has realplayer 10
[06:40] <netpython> Jimbo, but that wouldn't heal a broken system offcourse
[06:40] <Doow> what's the preferred IDE in Ubuntu/Gnome? Is it anjuta? (I'm used to emacs/make, but I want to move on =)
[06:40] <LjL> Doow, "preferred" by whom? ;)=
[06:40] <Doow> a good decent IDE that's easy to get started with
[06:41] <Doow> that I can learn to prefer ^
[06:41] <Doow> ^^ even
[06:41] <Jimbo> netpython...i can get it to boot from the hd and the monitor works if i put in the cd and select "boot from hd0
[06:41] <netpython> next_level, make the disk primary master and the cdrom secondary master or primary slave
[06:41] <roryy> Doow: *gasp* don't turn away from Emacs!
[06:41] <Jimbo> im not running from the live cd when i do that
[06:41] <next_level> that's done netpython
[06:41] <LjL> dunno, my own preference for "easy to start with" is a GUI text editor an gcc from the command line :-)

[06:43] <Doow> ubotu, I can't help but noticing that Anjuta isn't even in that list, does that mean I should avoid it?
[06:43] <netpython> next_level, one disk and one cdrom?

[07:03] <soundray> Stormx2: can I leave you to read the manpage and docs?
[07:03] <Skyrail> or does anyone else know waht can play Real Player files?
[07:03] <jbroome> tengil: that should do it.  then ssh -X remote and you should be ok
[07:03] <we2by> slavik: nope. I want the tool to configure the wpa key
[07:03] <netpython> Jadedwolf, yes it's a bit dated :-)
[07:03] <soundray> maxxism: try entering /topic on a line by itself, with no leading space
[07:03] <slavik> ahh ...
[07:03] <gsuveg> Skyrail: for example with real player
[07:03] <Jadedwolf> netpython: Plus I want to move fully over to linux
[07:04] <jbroome> tengil: i usually throw a -C in there too
[07:04] <slavik> System -> Admin -> Networking
[07:04] <tengil> jboome: ok but i'm not getting it to work
[07:04] <v3rt3x> how can I turn off aixgl completely?
[07:04] <tengil> jbroome: i'll test the C
[07:04] <netpython> Jadedwolf, :P
[07:04] <jbroome> -C is just compression.
[07:04] <Stormx2> soundray: Yeah, Im reading them at the mo.
[07:04] <Laslett> anyone give me advice on connecting wireless network please?
[07:04] <jbroome> tengil: the -X is case sensitive
[07:04] <soundray> !wireless | Laslett

[07:05] <Skyrail> gsuveg: ?? I'm trying to watch this file off the BBC website but it's not getting anywher with the standard movie player, so I tried installing Rela Player but it said there was a conflict...
[07:05] <Skyrail> *Real
[07:05] <tengil> jbroome: didn't help. I've also tried -Y
[07:05] <richy_> i got a problem, i had my server all done, rebooted and now it lost connection to internet, how is this possible?
[07:05] <tengil> jbroome: i get an empty $DISPLAY
[07:05] <tengil> jbroome: ... cannot open display: (null)
[07:05] <jbroome> ooh, didn't know about -Y.  nice
[07:06] <DracWiFi> thanks for the help, I guess it is just a matter of preference.
[07:06] <rickyfingers__> !richy, first of all, what does ifconfig return
[07:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about richy, first of all, what does ifconfig return - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:07] <gsuveg> Skyrail: what like conflict ?
[07:07] <we2by> how do I configure wpa on ubuntu?

[07:07] <Jadedwolf> Kinda blows not having a CC to get Cedega with, Sucks hard...
[07:07] <richy_> rickyfingers_: it doesnt display or list anything
[07:07] <rickyfingers__> if you don't see any interfaces, then most likeley, there's no module loaded for the nic
[07:07] <tengil> jbroome: it works on my old gentoo server (which i'm replacing) so it's not a network thing... drives me crazy
[07:07] <haffe> Hello, I'm running kubuntu 6.10 on an nforce2based computer. I would like to play enemy territory, but sound doesn't work. I get thefollowing error when I start et. /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy Could not open /dev/dsp
[07:07] <rickyfingers__> ok do you know what module goes with your nic?
[07:07] <Skyrail> gsuveg: let me get a screen shot
[07:07] <rickyfingers__> next step is do lsmod | grep <module name>
[07:08] <v3rt3x> !aixgl
[07:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about aixgl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:08] <rickyfingers__> see if anything comes back
[07:08] <Chetic> What do I do about Totem complaining that I don't have a decoder installed to handle the type of file I'm opening? Which happens to be an xvid avi file.
[07:08] <richy_> rickyfingers_: well it worked fine but i upgrade from 5.04 to 5.1 to 6.06 and after it rebootd it fails
[07:08] <rickyfingers__> if not, the module definitely isn't loaded.
[07:08] <richy_> how do i load t?
[07:08] <richy_> it*
[07:09] <rickyfingers__> richy: well, if you know the name of the module, first thing is to try modprobe <module-name>
[07:09] <slavik> man modprobe
[07:09] <richy_> man modprobe <module-name>?
[07:09] <rickyfingers__> richy: if you don't know it, you can try lspci
[07:10] <richy_> i dont know :P
[07:10] <richy_> il try
[07:10] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell richy_ about man
[07:10] <rickyfingers__> that'll give you a list of all the devices plugged in to the pci bus
[07:10] <jonas_H> I'm trying to run a program, a chinese learning tool, which is made for Windows and Mac. I was able to install the program, however the program can't find the lessons which are located in an .iso file. I mounted this file using :
[07:10] <jonas_H> sudo mkdir /media/iso
[07:10] <jonas_H> sudo modprobe loop
[07:10] <jonas_H> sudo mount file.iso /media/iso/ -t iso9660 -o loop
[07:10] <jonas_H> I can see the mounted .iso on my desktop. However the program still does not find the lessons. Any ideas what the problem might be?
[07:10] <rickyfingers__> richy: I'm assuming you have  a pci nic, is that the case?
[07:10] <maxxism> I am looking at the WiFiDocs pages.  I only see WPA listed.  anyone know if WPA2 is supported ??
[07:11] <soundray> jonas_H: are you running the program in wine?
[07:11] <AlinuxOS> hello, I would like to know the name of program that permits me to register my ubuntu session in flash format. Someone knows ?
[07:11] <richy_> rickyfingers_ how can i tell?
[07:12] <rickyfingers__> richy: if you have a pci nic? is the slot you plugged it into on your motherboard white?
[07:12] <richy_> its just a normall Ethernet card
[07:12] <rickyfingers__> richy: most likely it's a pci nic then
[07:12] <richy_> but when i boot its says basic Internet services fail
[07:12] <rickyfingers__> ok so execute lspci
[07:12] <soundray> AlinuxOS: don't know about flash, but check out istanbul:
[07:13] <soundray> !istanbul | AlinuxOS
[07:13] <ubotu> istanbul: Desktop session recorder. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 47 kB, installed size 380 kB
[07:13] <rickyfingers__> and look for a line that matches your ethernet card.
[07:13] <richy_> yes and then?
[07:13] <AlinuxOS> soundray, wow thanks ;)
[07:13] <rickyfingers__> After you've found that, do modprobe -l
[07:13] <rickyfingers__> actually, do modprobe -l | less
[07:13] <nebajoth> hey all yo.  I searched google and the forums, but didn't find much... what's the status on AMD64 Ubuntu?
[07:13] <rickyfingers__> and look through the modules for something that matches your ethernet card
[07:14] <rickyfingers__> after you do modprobe -l | less
[07:14] <Stormx2> What about lmsensors? How do i get hold of that?
[07:14] <soundray> nebajoth: what do you mean? It works.
[07:14] <nebajoth> Flash, WMV?
[07:14] <richy_> rickyfingers_ yah it shows me some parameters i can enter.. :s
[07:14] <rickyfingers__> you can search the output by typing '/ <texttosearchfor>
[07:14] <jonas_H> well, can't really tell :) I just double click the -exe file. but since it is only for mac and windows...
[07:14] <LjL> Stormx2: sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
[07:14] <v3rmap> Anyone know why folders shared using SMB on Dapper would be inaccessible from a windows machine?
[07:14] <soundray> nebajoth: no flash -- ask Adobe.
[07:14] <nebajoth> heheh
[07:14] <Stormx2> LjL, ah thers a dash
[07:14] <nebajoth> they're working on it, far as a I can tell
[07:14] <richy_> lets see i think it works, sec
[07:14] <nebajoth> is there a significant speed boost to using AMD64?
[07:15] <maxxism> v3rmap,  make sure your smb users and passwords are set
[07:15] <soundray> nebajoth: most codecs work fine on my system
[07:15] <richy_> jep it works
[07:15] <nebajoth> soundray: which ones don't?
[07:15] <soundray> nebajoth: not in desktop use
[07:15] <jonas_H> soundray: well, can't really tell :) I just double click the -exe file. but since it is only for mac and windows... is it possible to run a windows program without wine??
[07:15] <richy_> still php does not work :S
[07:15] <nebajoth> soundray: nod.  so in cost/benefit for my desktop, should I stick to i386?
[07:15] <v3rmap> maxxism: is setting the smb userid and password necessary? I was just using the ubuntu user name and password.
[07:15] <soundray> nebajoth: I don't know, I never check what I'm playing. Most of the occasional videos I get work fine.
[07:15] <ROBOd2> hello guys
[07:15] <ROBOd2> i have my entire ubuntu edgy system in french
[07:16] <nebajoth> soundray: why are you running amd64?
[07:16] <soundray> nebajoth: yes, unless you routinely run numbercrunching apps
[07:16] <maxxism> v3rmap.  i had to on breezy and dapper.  it doesnt do it for you.
[07:16] <ROBOd2> for some reason quanta always starts in english
[07:16] <ROBOd2> what to do?
[07:16] <soundray> nebajoth: because I routinely run numbercrunching apps ;) (medical image processing)
[07:16] <v3rmap> maxxism: thanks, that's something I'll try tomorrow.
[07:16] <nebajoth> soundray: ha
[07:16] <nebajoth> soundray: nod

[07:23] <] -[erbie> rambo3: no, did not try with vesa  - ubuntu was correctly recognizing my matrox mga g200, so didn't try it
[07:23] <dv5237> nolimitsoya: FreeBSD got ssh included in the base so yeah it is.
[07:23] <dv5237> nebajoth: thanks
[07:23] <] -[erbie> rambo3: do you think it's worth a try?

[07:25] <maxxism> can someone suggest the best hauppauge capture card for ubuntu?
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> dv5237, no, you should read what a said again. :) there are no ssh components installed in ubuntu server, and thats what you asked about. and bsd is not linux, for that matter
[07:26] <gsuveg> Skyrail: then, swithc to advaced view to resoldve this probelm :)
[07:26] <maxxism> when I say best I mean just works.
[07:26] <Skyrail> gsuveg: I don't know how lol, its goes to the synaptic package manager
[07:26] <rambo3> isnt ubuntu server just a base system with iptables -F
[07:26] <nebajoth> not if you pick the LAMP option
[07:27] <Elwell> soundray: Executing 'builtin_dd if=HMC_Recovery_V6R1.0_1.iso of=/dev/dvd obs=32k seek=0' - Fingers Crossed :-)
[07:27] <Stormx2> Yay I got lm-sensors working!
[07:27] <soundray> Elwell: hope it works for you. I've only ever burnt DVDs with nautilus ;)
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> whats thepoint with server edition anyway? is there realy anything that cant be done with the normaltext mode install?
[07:27] <Stormx2> XD The label "+2.5V" is giving a reading of "1.18V"
[07:28] <gsuveg> Skyrail: im never use gui for install :)
[07:28] <jonas_H> does anyone know alot about latex?
[07:28] <Elwell> soundray: yeah, but installing X would be a PITA on this motherboard. (cheapo onboard)
[07:28] <dv5237> nolimitsoya: sorry dont really feel like arguing this can go on for hours.. good day though :)
[07:28] <soundray> jonas_H: try me
[07:28] <nebajoth> nolimitsoya: its pretty handy having the LAMP stack preconfigured, actually
[07:28] <eilker> people i can access to my ftp server from console, but i cant access it from browser any ideas?

[07:30] <jonas_H> I am trying to produce a pdf document with pictures (.eps format). I use "\includegraphics{}". In the document that is produced I can't see the picture. the label is there and empty space where the picture should be, but no picture.
[07:30] <soundray> Skyrail: tie up loose ends
[07:30] <Skyrail> soundray: oh, ok thanks
[07:30] <jonas_H> any ideas?
[07:31] <Znuff> Hello. I've got an Intel E100 network card and ubuntu doesn't see it. I can see the module beeing loaded, but "ifconfig eth0" tells me that there's no such device
[07:31] <robokop> could sb here help me with setting up beryl
[07:31] <Skyrail> done
[07:31] <nolimitsoya> nebajoth, what does "preconfigured" mean? does it leave you with anything diffrent from apt-get install apache mysql php?
[07:31] <eilker> soundray: anonymous_enable=YES  isnt it ok? it is like that in vsftpd.conf
[07:31] <soundray> jonas_H: are you typesetting with latex or pdflatex?
[07:31] <jonas_H> latex
[07:31] <jonas_H> I guess
[07:31] <Elwell> Znuff: dmesg | grep eth - show anything wierd?
[07:32] <soundray> eilker: should be -- is that setting active, though? Restart vsftpd to be sure.
[07:32] <Znuff> Elwell, nope, doesn't give me any warning/error whatsoever
[07:32] <jonas_H> what does typesetting mean?
[07:32] <Elwell> is the hardware coming up to a link light?
[07:32] <soundray> jonas_H: are you looking at the dvi? With xdvi?
[07:32] <jonas_H> I'm looking at the dvi with evince
[07:32] <Enselic> jonas_H: pdflatex has troubles including .eps images
[07:33] <jonas_H> hmm
[07:33] <Znuff> Elwell, uh, yeah
[07:33] <jonas_H> maybe I could try .jpg?
[07:34] <fredde_> Is there any known bug with tilda not displaying when using beryl?
[07:34] <eilker> soundray: i restarted again same, by the way, i write ftp://myip  to access my ftp , is it correct ?
[07:34] <breery> is there any reason why it takes 15 min to transfer a 6mb file to a 256 mb flash drive, i thought it would be much faster
[07:34] <Enselic> jonas_H: do you \usepackage{epsfig} at the beginning of the document?
[07:34] <jonas_H> no, just \usepackage{graphicx}
[07:34] <jonas_H> \usepackage{wrapfig}
[07:34] <jonas_H> for pictures that is
[07:34] <Znuff> Elwell, I installed the system on another computer... could it be something modprobe related?
[07:34] <gsuveg> eilker: ftp://localhost ?
[07:34] <jonas_H> I'll try that
[07:34] <robokop> could sb here help me with setting up beryl
[07:34] <soundray> eilker: sounds correct to me
[07:35] <Enselic> jonas_H: Well, try \usepackage{epsfig}
[07:35] <eilker> gsuveg: ftp://localhost  works, it opens...
[07:35] <Elwell> Znuff: e100's are fairly bulletproof. lsmod shows module still loaded?
[07:35] <gsuveg> that was my first question
[07:35] <jonas_H> hm, didn't work
[07:35] <kristalino> i can only connect to my proftpd in active mode.  Could anyone help me by chance ?
[07:36] <Znuff> Elwell, yup, it's loaded
[07:36] <gsuveg> then dont listen on outsite interface
[07:36] <gsuveg> eilker: ^
[07:36] <eilker> gsuveg: ohh i now see my problem....
[07:36] <soundray> jonas_H: I tend to avoid eps figures, using pdf instead and creating pdf output with pdflatex (no .dvi)
[07:36] <eilker> gsuveg: ftp server uses 21. port ? i may do port forwarding?
[07:37] <gsuveg> if behind nat
[07:37] <robokop> could sb here help me with setting up beryl

[07:37] <soundray> !firestarter | eilker
[07:37] <ubotu> eilker: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[07:37] <kristalino> thanks, bye.
[07:38] <Elwell> Znuff: I'm stumped. if module up and dmesg shows system identifying it it should (IMHO) be there. ifconfig -a not give any alternate names?
[07:38] <Znuff> Elwell, let me see
[07:38] <Elwell> s/module up/module loaded/
[07:38] <Znuff> Elwell, ugh, it's eth2 o.O
[07:38] <Enselic> jonas_H: Gtg, see private message
[07:38] <breery> does anyone else suffer from long transfer times between flash devices and files?
[07:39] <Znuff> jesus, how do I change it back to eth2?
[07:39] <Enselic> jonas_H: that should work (does for me)
[07:39] <Elwell> Znuff: been there, done the swearing
[07:39] <Znuff> erm: 0
[07:39] <darkposeiden> is LVM recommended for a server where you would dedicate the entire drive to the OS?

[07:39] <vader> breery, not me dude. but I run with USN 2.0 most of the time, if it is USB 1..... it does take a bit of time.

[07:39] <Znuff> iftab!@#$!@#$!@#$
[07:40] <robokop> could sb here help me with setting up beryl

[07:47] <dv5237> robokop: what dir did you mean?
[07:47] <paitart> soundray, thanks for the help!

[07:47] <|DioX|> i put in my pc a new pci wirless card, i activate it in network configuration but it don't works; i use udgy eft; someone help me ?
[07:48] <drcode> if I upgrade

[07:48] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, sudo apt-get remove --purge <nameofpackage> && sudo apt-get install <nameofpackage>
[07:48] <soundray> drcode: yes, to 2.6.17
[07:48] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: ok I'll give it a try thanks :)
[07:48] <drcode> soundray: where can I find upgrade info to edgy?
[07:48] <soundray> drcode: make sure you have one of the -desktop packages before you go ahead
[07:48] <soundray> drcode: in the /topic
[07:48] <drcode> I use it as server, is it stable to upgrade?
[07:48] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, type 'man apt' in a terminal to read the manual for the package manager :)
[07:49] <drcode> I use only console
[07:49] <breery> soundray: it just gave me 40min on a 3 mb file, i think ill check the cable, could that be a problem?
[07:49] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: woah, ok thanks :)
[07:49] <robokop> dv5237: forgot am searching for the right one :S
[07:49] <soundray> breery: yes, but you should see that in the logs
[07:49] <soundray> drcode: oops, not any more

[07:51] <soundray> nolimitsoya: if drcode needs a more recent kernel, (s)he is better off upgrading than grafting a newer kernel into dapper.
[07:51] <|DioX|> i put in my pc a new pci wirless card, i activate it in network configuration but it don't works; i use udgy eft; someone help me ?

[07:55] <trukosh1> i am too interested in knowing which application opens a specific connection. i only know "netstat -anp" - and i think that is not 100%
[07:55] <robokop> dv5237: sorry can't find it
[07:55] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, thats a bit rude... how about specifying your critizism a bit?
[07:55] <nolimitsoya> drcode, about what?
[07:55] <soundray> fourat: I don't think so, but you might be interested in the dfsbuild package and associated docs.
[07:55] <drcode> I want to upgrade only the kernel
[07:55] <soundray> !dfsbuild | fourat
[07:56] <ubotu> dfsbuild: Build Debian From Scratch CD/DVD images. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.99.1 (edgy), package size 1300 kB, installed size 4404 kB (Only available for i386 alpha powerpc amd64)
[07:56] <drcode> in dpper 2.6.10 to 2.6.12
[07:56] <drcode> I am on dapper 6.0.6
[07:56] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: hmm? Sorry, I usually get 'told off' as I don't search google first, so I just searched google and found somehting perfect to my needs, sorry if I offended you in any way :(
[07:56] <nolimitsoya> drcode, if you realy, realy _need_ the new kernel, it might be a better idea to upgrade to edgy, as suggested
[07:56] <soundray> drcode: don't go to 2.6.12 -- go to 2.6.15 instead. What architecture -- i386?
[07:57] <drcode> yes
[07:57] <dcordes> nolimitsoya: you meant dcordes?
[07:57] <dcordes> lol
[07:57] <soundray> drcode: 2.6.15 is the latest for dapper.
[07:57] <drcode> so soundray  how I do it?
[07:57] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: oh maybe I didn't find the right thing...
[07:57] <soundray> drcode: very easy, just 'sudo apt-get install linux-i386'
[07:57] <drcode> k
[07:57] <drcode> thanx
[07:57] <soundray> drcode: sorry, I thought you wanted to go beyond 2.6.15
[07:58] <dcordes> drcode: funny word play with our nicks
[07:58] <Arcad3> can i install UBUNTU to a friend in my LAN ???
[07:58] <drcode> no
[07:58] <soundray> drcode: hold on...
[07:58] <drcode> thjhanx
[07:58] <mads-> How does screen command work - I can't really see it =/ Or is there anything better? I need the program to run when I log of from ssh...
[07:58] <soundray> drcode: you have to do 'sudo apt-get update' before the install.
[07:58] <drcode>  Couldn't find package linux-i386
[07:58] <Arcad3> can i install UBUNTU to a friend in my LAN ???
[07:58] <dcordes> drcode: when you take my r and put it after my d, removing the s at the end you have your nick
[07:58] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, np, i just thought i saw a sarcastic tone there :)
[07:58] <Admiral_Chicago> Arcad3: i think so
[07:58] <we2by> edgy works so fast here
[07:58] <we2by> alot better than dapper
[07:59] <Admiral_Chicago> give me a second to find out hom
[07:59] <drcode> no such packge
[07:59] <Arcad3> any How to?
[07:59] <drcode> soundray: ?
[07:59] <EmxBA> guys
[07:59] <Arcad3> oke
[07:59] <MonsieurBon> hello
[07:59] <EmxBA> edgy fresh install works better than dapper on my machine
[07:59] <red_> decidme cual es el canal en espaol
[07:59] <EmxBA> and upgrading dapper to edgy is helly
[07:59] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: oh no, I'm completely new to Linux and so I am susceptible to asking stupid questions without searching first
[07:59] <soundray> mads-: you ssh into the remote box, then start screen. "Detach" the session with Ctrl-A D and exit. When you next ssh, just re-attach with screen -R -D
[08:00] <soundray> mads-: try man screen for more detail
[08:00] <psusi> I had no problem at all upgrading
[08:00] <soundray> drcode yes?

I can't determine the cause, but I find that I can't switch windows or desktops, I can move the mouse but it doesn't allow me to click on anything.  I can launch apps via alt+f2 and close apps with alt+f4.  top doesn't show anything running mad.  This is a dell d600 notebook running with wireless through ndiswrapper.  any ideas?
[08:01] <Arcad3> Thanks Chicago Amiral
[08:01] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, some times its faster to ask here than google, and if noone wants to awsner, they wont ;)
[08:01] <Infecto> i`m going to be maddddddddd
[08:01] <EmxBA> der0b, it sometimes hanged at my machine too
[08:01] <der0b> did you find a fix emxba?
[08:01] <soundray> der0b: broken left mouse button?
[08:01] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: I prefer to talk to a human being then search google but plenty of times people have pointed out use gogle instead...so I do, sorry, do you know how to set up an Ubuntu based PC as a server by any chance?
[08:01] <der0b> wakkkaaa wakkaaa
[08:01] <EmxBA> der0b, no
[08:02] <EmxBA> Skyrail, download server edition
[08:02] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, that would depend on the typ of server. there are lots of those ;)
[08:02] <soundray> drcode: 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install linux-i386'
[08:02] <drcode> I did...
[08:02] <higi> hello
[08:03] <maxxism> soundray I am interested in this dfsbuild.  I just installed it.  dont laugh,  but is there something a little more GUI like?
[08:03] <higi> how do i tell ubuntu where the SWAP is? ive changed my partitions
[08:03] <psusi> MonsieurBon: try prefixing the command with LANG=en_us to make it speak english so I can understand it? ;)
[08:03] <Skyrail> EmxBA: I haven't got the internet connection to handle it really, its just a home based server for others to access it and so that this PC can have its own 'homepage' for when the rest of the family want to access certain important files...yeah...
[08:03] <psusi> MonsieurBon: make that en_US
[08:03] <soundray> maxxism: I don't know. I haven't tried it myself - just put it on my mile-long to-do list
[08:03] <MonsieurBon> psusi: just a second
[08:03] <higi> how do i tell ubuntu where the SWAP is? ive changed my partitions
[08:03] <dnite> does anyone know where i can find a log file for gnome-compiz-manager?? I'm having some random lockup problems that i'd like to track and i havent' found any useful information in /var/log ...
[08:04] <psusi> higi: edit /etc/fstab
[08:04] <higi> ok thanks!
[08:04] <soundray> higi: 'gksudo gedit /etc/fstab'
[08:04] <trukosh1> higi mkswap swapon fstab <- man
[08:04] <maxxism> soundray hehe.  I would love to do this.  I could make an install disc using the proper kernel and video drivers for my system.  sounds like alot less of a headache when doing an install
[08:04] <soundray> maxxism: dang, how often do you install? ;)
[08:05] <psusi> maxxism: there is no need... the proper drivers will be used with the standard cd
[08:05] <Admiral_Chicago> dnite: did you also try #ubuntu-xgl
[08:05] <maxxism> soundray,  well I like to play a bit too much.  and sometimes when things get borked a reinstall is easiest
[08:05] <drcode> k
[08:05] <dnite> Admiral_Chicago, awesome. thanks
[08:05] <drcode> it worked
[08:05] <drcode> thanx
[08:05] <zerod> hello
[08:05] <burrito10> i'm using openoffice2 in ubuntu edgy, and i can't get it to quickstart properly... i don't know the parameter for starting it on the tray, and even when i start it manually and select "enable quickstarter", when i restart my system the quickstarter isn't there... any ideas?
[08:05] <soundray> maxxism: I prefer partition images
[08:05] <psusi> maxxism: also you might try using backups... a restore from backup is easier than reinstall
[08:06] <maxxism> soundray i have yet to figure images out.
[08:06] <psusi> plain old tar works great
[08:06] <soundray> !partimage | maxxism
[08:06] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: sorry for such the noobish question, but I've opened a file to be edited in the terminal, now how do I save the file?

[08:06] <higi> psusi: soundray turkosh
[08:06] <maxxism> ty
[08:06] <higi> turkosh1 im doing mkswap swapon /dev/sda5, it doesnt work
[08:06] <soundray> Skyrail: which editor?
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, opened with what?
[08:07] <Skyrail> soundray: just in the terminal
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, using nano?
[08:07] <soundray> Skyrail: what did you enter to open the file?
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> in than case, crtl+x
[08:07] <zerod> not sure
[08:07] <higi> turkosh1 im doing mkswap swapon /dev/sda5
[08:07] <Skyrail> soundray: vi
[08:07] <trukosh1> higi, man mkswap - man swapon
[08:07] <psusi> higi: what doesn't work about it?  "it does not work" is not a very good error description
[08:07] <higi> whys that wrong?
[08:07] <MonsieurBon> psusi: ehm, what's the exact command???
[08:08] <nolimitsoya> soundray, ^^
[08:08] <trukosh1> higi, you do it on one line?
[08:08] <psusi> MonsieurBon: take whatever command you had before, and prefix it with LANG=en_US <space>
[08:08] <soundray> Skyrail: ESC !wq
[08:08] <Skyrail> soundray: thanks
[08:08] <MonsieurBon> psusi: ok
[08:08] <Skyrail> soundray: will that save it?
[08:08] <soundray> Skyrail: it should
[08:09] <Skyrail> soundray: ok thanks
[08:09] <soundray> Skyrail: use nano instead, it's more newbie friendly
[08:09] <soundray> Skyrail: or search the web for 'vi cheatsheet' ;)
[08:09] <felixjet> how can i open a terminal in the current nautilus folder?

[08:10] <Lahey> shoul i partition or format my drive in way before installing ubunto
[08:10] <slimz> hey guys, im trying to vnc to my home ubuntu pc from a windows xp machine at work, and it wont connect, do the default settings only allow LAN connections?
[08:10] <higi> now?
[08:10] <Lahey> *ubuntu
[08:10] <soundray> Lahey: you can, but you don't have to
[08:11] <Lahey> soundray, ok im guessing it will give me a chance to when i load the boot disk
[08:12] <soundray> Lahey: yes, if you use the live CD, it will run gparted as part of the installation procedure.
[08:12] <kNox> i've got a problem with ubuntu 6.06: i ordered it from the website, and it's been giving me a hard time. whenever i try to install it, it just stops responding (takes up to 20 minutes to open the install window, this can't be right) - it does the same with other ubuntu cds, but other cds work just fine. what should i do ?
[08:12] <soundray> Lahey: unless you go for one of the easy options, like erasing and using an entire HD.
[08:13] <Lahey> soundray, sweet - i use the live cd of gparted to partition my windows box
[08:13] <Skyrail> soundray: could you point me in the direction of nano please?
[08:13] <needhel1> Help wanted: I've problem changing screen resolution higher than 1024x768 with the Screen Resolution selector tool.
[08:13] <Lahey> soundray, its a new HD
[08:13] <jbroome> Lahey: yeah, it's nice, i keep a copy in my laptop bag
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, just type nane /path-to-file
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> *nano
[08:13] <soundray> Skyrail: it should be installed -- it's part of ubuntu base...
=== eggzeck_ is now known as eggzeck[laptop] 
[08:13] <Lahey> jbroome, i do as wall, very handy tool
[08:13] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: oh ok, I'll give it a try thanks
[08:14] <MonsieurBon> psusi: there is no error with LANG=en_US.... but there still is in normal mode (with german)!!
[08:14] <_cyanide> hi :)
[08:14] <burrito10> i'm using openoffice2 in ubuntu edgy, and i can't get it to quickstart properly... i don't know the parameter for starting it on the tray, and even when i start it manually and select "enable quickstarter", when i restart my system the quickstarter isn't there... any ideas ?
[08:14] <psusi> MonsieurBon: all that does is switch the language... the same thing should happen, it just should pritn the error message in english
[08:14] <soundray> Lahey: I suggest you create a root, home and swap partition. The ubuntu default is to only create a root and a swap partition.
[08:14] <_cyanide> can anybody tell me which bootloader is used in ubuntu-ppc?
[08:14] <MonsieurBon> psusi: it does not.... strange...
[08:14] <kNox> anyone care to share an opinion about my problem?
[08:15] <Rede> is there a way to have apt-get install an older version of an app than the latest?
[08:15] <Lahey> soundray, what the home partition for
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> _cyanide, wouldnt that be grub as welll?
[08:15] <dcordes> is there an image viewer, similar to the windows xp one?
[08:15] <_cyanide> nolimitsoya, i heard grub doesnt work on the ppc arch
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> dcordes, gqview
[08:15] <dcordes> nolimitsoya: thx
[08:16] <soundray> Lahey: /home contains a directory for each user you create, holding the user data and personalised configuration data.
[08:16] <gnomefreak> _cyanide: macs use yaboot atleast before they went intel
[08:16] <_cyanide> oh ok :)
[08:16] <MonsieurBon> psusi: there is some perl warning caused by the locale, but no error
[08:16] <soundray> Lahey: if you separate it, it's easier to backup in case at some point you decide to reinstall rather than upgrade
[08:17] <Lahey> soundray, I will be the only user on the box, do i still need one, and if so how big?
[08:17] <_cyanide> thanks
[08:17] <Lahey> soundray, ok i see
[08:18] <kNox> anybody care to guide me to somewhere i could get help ?
[08:18] <soundray> Lahey: rule of thumb: 10GB for / , amount of RAM for swap, rest for /home. More / space, or a separate /var partition, if you have large sql databases.
[08:18] <dsnyders> Hi all!  Synaptic is being a pain.  I am trying to remove a package (radeontool), and it wants to remove gnome, gnome-core, and a bunch of other things.  How do I limit what it removes?
[08:18] <Lahey> soundray, so ill use gparted to create a root, home, and swap partition. How big should they be on a totoal of 40 gig drive
[08:18] <needhel1> Help wanted: I've problem changing screen resolution higher than 1024x768 with the Screen Resolution selector tool.
[08:18] <tylerl> Whats an easy way to find out if I have Java installed?
[08:18] <gourdin> where can I find the realplayer package ?

[08:19] <burrito10> tylerl: run openoofice
[08:19] <burrito10> tylerl: go to options - java
[08:19] <sioux> i have a serius problem with my laptop, each time I connect a usb device after a while the systems freez mo more controls are available the only thing I can do is restart

[08:20] <xgm> Hello, I just downloaded VMware-workstation-5.5.2-29772.tar.gz, inside this file there is vmware-install.pl, how to install this VMware ?
[08:20] <tylerl> burrito10: I have 1.4.2 installed.  Is there a package to update to 1.5?
[08:20] <psusi> soundray: why bother with a seperate /home?
[08:20] <burrito10> tylerl: yes there is, at least for newer versions of ubuntu
[08:20] <soundray> psusi: explained above
[08:20] <Rede> is there a way to have apt-get install an older version of an app than the latest? i want to install kaffeine 0.7.1 instead of kaffeine 0.8.2...
[08:20] <jbroome> psusi: makes it easy to upgrade
[08:20] <burrito10> tylerl: just open synaptic, add the non-free repositories, and search for java
[08:20] <sioux> is there a log that I can see in order to understand what block the system?
[08:20] <tylerl> burrito10: K, hang on.
[08:20] <Lahey> soundray, what is / ? im a noob remember
[08:21] <psusi> I don't see how it is any easier
[08:21] <soundray> Lahey: the root partition that holds everything else in the hierarchy
[08:21] <darkx> how can i disamble checking files systems??
[08:21] <xgm> Hello, I just downloaded VMware-workstation-5.5.2-29772.tar.gz, inside this file there is vmware-install.pl, how to install this VMware ?
[08:21] <dbe> Lahey, The root.
[08:21] <psusi> upgrade is as simple as apt-get dist-upgrade... and backing up... tar can easily be told to backup just /home
[08:21] <tylerl> burrito10: lots of hits.  Which one do I install?  I see a lot of j2sdk1.4..
[08:21] <Lahey> soundray, is that where i save all my stuff?
[08:21] <nolimitsoya> darkx, you shouldnt, but an edit your fstab
[08:21] <soundray> Rede: get the 0.7.1 deb, and run 'dpkg -force-downgrade -i kaffeine....deb'
[08:21] <nolimitsoya> *can
[08:22] <burrito10> tylerl: do you want the developers kit or just the runtime?
[08:22] <soundray> Lahey: no, your personal stuff goes into /home/lahey (or whatever you call yourself)
[08:22] <tylerl> burrito10: Just the runtime.
[08:22] <burrito10> tylerl: it's j2ee i think, let me check
[08:22] <darkx> so.. what shoud i edit in here??
[08:23] <burrito10> tylerl: sun-j2re1.5 it seems
[08:23] <gnomefreak> tylerl: sudo apt-get install sun-java5-plugin
[08:23] <Lahey> soundray, ok so for a 40gig HD i should have a min of 10GB for /, 28GB for /home, 2GB for swap
[08:23] <Lahey> soundray, sound good?
[08:23] <tylerl> Thanks, to both of you :)
[08:23] <gnomefreak> tylerl: its in multiverse
[08:23] <darkx> what shoud i edit in fstab??
[08:23] <soundray> Lahey: how much RAM do you have?
[08:23] <darkx> so i can disamble fsck??
[08:24] <Lahey> soundray. 756
[08:24] <drcode> still I got old kernel
[08:24] <Lahey> soundray. MB
[08:24] <drcode> I did apt-get install linux-386
[08:24] <psusi> Lahey: then that's all the bigger swap needs to be
[08:24] <nolimitsoya> darkx, why do you want toin the first place?
[08:24] <Ranbee> hi, can anyone tell me how to change the font colour in
[08:24] <drcode> still kernel remain old
[08:24] <burrito10> tylerl: sorry i named an unofficial package
[08:24] <soundray> Lahey: probably not worth making more than 1GB swap space then.
[08:24] <drcode> it told me he downlaod new kernel
[08:24] <tylerl> When I'm using terminal and I want to auto-enter a directory by hitting *tab, tab*, I always hear an annoying computer beep.  How do i disable that?
[08:24] <darkx> when i boot up..
[08:24] <psusi> darkx: fsck runs automatically when it is required because the partition is damaged
[08:24] <Lahey> soundray. what is swap for
[08:24] <darkx> ok.. this is my proble:
[08:25] <xgm> Hello, I just downloaded VMware-workstation-5.5.2-29772.tar.gz, inside this file there is vmware-install.pl, how to install this VMware ?
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> darkx, please, highlight the person you are atlking to (me)
[08:25] <drcode> any idea?

[08:25] <needhel1> Help wanted: I've problem changing screen resolution higher than 1024x768 with the Screen Resolution selector tool.
[08:25] <soundray> drcode: reboot
[08:25] <psusi> Lahey: virtual memory
[08:25] <darkx> nolimitsoya, when y boot up...
[08:25] <drcode> I did
[08:25] <soundray> Lahey: when you run out of RAM, it uses swap space to supplement RAM.
[08:25] <drcode> still 2.6.10-5-386 #1 Tue Apr 5 12:12:40 UTC 2005 i586 GNU/Linux
[08:26] <dsnyders> Lahey, When the computer needs more memory to run something than what is available in ram, it will make room by copying some of the stuff out of ram into swap
[08:26] <soundray> drcode: do you have a customized grub setup?
[08:26] <darkx> it dose the basic checks.. and when it gets to "checking file systems"
[08:26] <wayuphill> virtual memory should typically be double your RAM, correct?
[08:26] <darkx> it freezes.. and only ctrl + c can brake it..
[08:26] <drcode> dont know
[08:26] <drcode> how I can check it
[08:26] <psusi> darkx: let it finish the check
[08:26] <Skyrai1> that was close
[08:26] <darkx> i tryed developer mode..
[08:26] <nolimitsoya> darkx, when you boot up... what? whole sentences please, still highlighted. dont break things in half, get you problemdescription in one line
[08:27] <darkx> ok
[08:27] <soundray> drcode: what do you get when you run 'sudo update-grub'?
[08:27] <Flats> Whats the best way to burn MP3's in Ubuntu?  DO i need a codec for Serpentine?
[08:27] <drcode> Found kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386
[08:27] <darkx> i am not realy good with this chath software.. i use gaim and mirc
[08:27] <drcode> Updating /boot/grub/menu.lst ... done
[08:27] <psusi> Flats: same way you burn any other file to cd
[08:28] <Flats> But what software?  guess my question was a little vague
[08:28] <tylerl> So... files in /bin/ are basically application files for the OS, and files in /usr/bin/ are application files for the user.. is that kind of correct?
[08:28] <we2by> how do you make the gnome terminal transparent?
[08:28] <LaCReMeL> Woow nice vide watch that :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvMRLAzMBw
[08:28] <dsnyders> tylerl, that is more or less correct.
[08:29] <darkx> the problem is that that it starts the dosfsck and it stays like that.. dosen't verbe any file, the hdd led is not flashing
=== Rendergraf_ is now known as kronox
[08:29] <xgm> Hello, I just downloaded VMware-workstation-5.5.2-29772.tar.gz, inside this file there is vmware-install.pl, how to install this VMware ?
[08:29] <psusi> Flats: open the cd and drag and drop files to it
[08:29] <tylerl> dsnyders: And /sbin/ is admin-only apps? That correct?
[08:29] <Lahey> so it alot like the windows VR
[08:29] <dsnyders> tylerl, Right.
[08:29] <we2by> any way to get real transparency without using compiz/cgl?
[08:29] <Flats> psusi: Serpentine does not recognize the mp3 file type
[08:29] <JohnFlux> we2by: nope
[08:29] <psusi> darkx: you have a fat partition for windows or something?
[08:29] <darkx> yes
[08:29] <JohnFlux> we2by: you have to have a composite manager
[08:30] <JohnFlux> we2by: i used beryl
[08:30] <darkx> 2 fat 1 ntfs
[08:30] <drcode> soundray: to do reboot after?
[08:30] <we2by> yea, but beryl uses alot ram
[08:30] <darkx> 1 ext 1 swap
[08:30] <soundray> drcode: no
[08:30] <we2by> I only have 512mb
[08:30] <Lahey> so then 10/ 29/home 1GB for swap
[08:30] <psusi> Flats: serpentine is a music player isn't it?  I though you said you wanted to burn the mp3s
[08:30] <xgm> Hello, I just downloaded VMware-workstation-5.5.2-29772.tar.gz, inside this file there is vmware-install.pl, how to install this VMware ?
[08:30] <LaCReMeL> Woow nice vide watch that :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvMRLAzMBw
[08:30] <drcode> k
[08:30] <soundray> drcode: you still haven't got the new kernel installed.
[08:30] <tylerl> dsnyders: I just installed a program.. whats an easy way to find it?  I installed Tomcat, and in order to install another program, I must: Copy proxy.war file to webapps directory in Tomcat.
[08:30] <psusi> darkx: try manually fscking it and see if it works
[08:30] <nolimitsoya> xgm, sudo ./vmware-install.pl
[08:30] <Lahey> soundray. so then 10/ 29/home 1GB for swap
[08:30] <Flats> psusi: No says serpentine is an audio CD creator
[08:30] <nolimitsoya> xgm, from a terminal :)
[08:31] <Lahey> psusi, so then 10/ 29/home 1GB for swap
[08:31] <soundray> Lahey: yes
[08:31] <psusi> Flats: do you want to burn an audio cd or an mp3 cd?
[08:31] <xgm> ty
[08:31] <dsnyders> tylerl, There is a program called which.  which tomcat will tell you where it is installed.  whereis also works
[08:31] <burrito10> i'm using openoffice2 in ubuntu edgy, and i can't get it to quickstart properly... i don't know the parameter for starting it on the tray, and even when i start it manually and select "enable quickstarter", when i restart my system the quickstarter isn't there... any ideas?
[08:31] <Lahey> soundray, ok SWEET
[08:31] <Flats> psusi well i want to burn MP3 files onto an audio CD for general use
[08:31] <tylerl> dsnyders: thanks.
[08:31] <swilliamson> anyone familiar the Ubuntu Dapper LAMP install, i am trying to install the mysql devel tools and getting no joy
[08:31] <tylerl> dsnyders: Why is there /sbin/, and also /usr/sbin/?
[08:31] <Jimbo> i reinstalled the broken ubuntu
[08:31] <psusi> Flats: then yea, you need the correct codec for it to decode the mp3s
[08:31] <soundray> drcode: what do you get from 'dpkg -l linux-image-2.6.15*'?
[08:32] <Lahey> THANKS FOR THE HELP!!!
[08:32] <drcode> No packages found matching linux-image-2.6.15*.
[08:32] <JohnFlux> I upgraded from dapper to edgy and now my hp laser printer doesn't work.  There no errors or anything, and cups says it has printed.  but it hasnt
[08:32] <Jimbo> i need to get samba and need the script for mounting hdb1 permanantly again
[08:32] <soundray> Lahey: yw, good luck
[08:32] <psusi> Flats: btw, try to avoid using mp3... try ogg vorbis instead... it's at least if not better quality, and it's actually free, unlike mp3
[08:32] <JohnFlux> anyone have any idea?
[08:32] <soundray> drcode: how about 'sudo apt-get update'?
[08:32] <burrito10> psusi: easier said than done  :)
[08:32] <Flats> psusi: OK thanks
[08:32] <Adam_G_laptop> Hi all. In Prefrences -> Remote Desktop, is there a way to require a password for control, but not for viewing?
[08:33] <Jimbo> i tried sudo apt get samba but it didnt work
[08:33] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, samba: sudo apt-get install samba, persistend mount: fstab
[08:33] <Jimbo> thanx brb
[08:33] <Flats> next question,  Firefox constantly closes on me.  No errors or nothing.  After two or three tries it opens but then closes again shortly thereafter
[08:33] <nolimitsoya> *t
[08:33] <drcode> I need to do apt-get install linux-image*
[08:33] <dsnyders> tylerl, Unix is 30-40 years old.  Some things are there for historical reasons and no longer make a lot of sense.  Basically, they are root level programs that users can use.
[08:33] <Doow> Is there some easy way of playing a test sound on a specific card in Alsa (ie not the default one)
[08:33] <nolimitsoya> Flats, open from a terminal and read the output of a crash
[08:34] <tylerl> dsnyders: I see.  Thank you
[08:34] <Jimbo> nolimitsoya: is this one command or two>  sudo apt-get install samba, persistend mount: fstab
[08:34] <psusi> ./sbin is there to contain critical system programs required to ahve a minimal bootable system
[08:34] <soundray> Flats: 'mkdir $HOME/firefox-config-backup ; mv $HOME/.mozilla $HOME/firefox-config-backup ; firefox'
[08:34] <psusi> ./usr/sbin is for administration programs that are not critical and required to boot, so it can be on a seperate filesystem
[08:34] <burrito10> i'm using openoffice2 in ubuntu edgy, and i can't get it to quickstart properly... i don't know the parameter for starting it on the tray, and even when i start it manually and select "enable quickstarter", when i restart my system the quickstarter isn't there... any ideas ?
[08:34] <thelost> hey how do I make a user a sudoer?
[08:34] <Jadedwolf> Whats a good MP3 player for Ubuntu?
[08:34] <darkx> There are differences between boot sector and its backup.
[08:34] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, 'sudo apt-get install samba' is one command. fstab is a file to add entries to, to get a persistent mount. ill guide you through it when samba is taken care of
[08:34] <darkx> Differences: (offset:original/backup)
[08:34] <darkx>   28:3f/30, 31:00/0f
[08:34] <temba> hi there
[08:34] <Flats> psusi: The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
[08:35] <soundray> drcode: you need to 'sudo apt-get update' and tell me whether that gives you any errors
[08:35] <Jimbo> ok brb
[08:35] <Doow> I _am_ supposed to use alsa to get sound in gnome, right?
[08:35] <drcode> I did
[08:35] <drcode> no error
[08:35] <darkx> psusi: what do i do now??
[08:35] <soundray> thelost: add her to the admin group
[08:35] <nolimitsoya> Doow, yes
[08:35] <psusi> darkx: ok... let it fix it
[08:35] <temba> how do i quota in ubuntu, that user only have 500mb in their /home ?
[08:35] <Doow> hi soya
[08:35] <nolimitsoya> hi Doow :)
[08:36] <Doow> thought you were writing 24/7 on FZ =)
[08:36] <soundray> drcode: now 'dpkg -l linux-image-2.6.15*' again pls?
[08:36] <darkx> 1) Copy original to backup
[08:36] <darkx> 2) Copy backup to original
[08:36] <darkx> 3) No action
[08:36] <tylerl> dsnyders: Is there such thing as a "back" command? To go back to the directory you were in prior to current?

[08:37] <dsnyders> tylerl, no, however there is a pushd and popd which will allow you to temporarily go to another directory.
[08:37] <darkx> psusi : thanks
[08:37] <psusi> temba: what don't you understand?

[08:37] <bieb_work> do you remember trying to help me with the RAID install?
[08:38] <darkx> psusi : Leaving file system unchanged ??? he diden't make any changes??
[08:38] <psusi> bieb_work: yes
[08:38] <tylerl> How do I define my Java variables?
[08:38] <dsnyders> tylerl, never heard of that one before.
[08:38] <Doow> nolimitsoya, and I don't want to use the integrated soundcard =)
[08:38] <tylerl> dsnyders: :)
[08:38] <dv5237> does anyone know how i can open the ftp client from gnome on the CLI?
[08:38] <bieb_work> I figured it out....
[08:38] <psusi> darkx: you don't have it mounted do you?
[08:38] <burrito10> Jadedwolf: the default one (rhythmbox) is excellent for managing your collection, and totem is good for just playing a couple songs
[08:38] <dsnyders> tylerl, it seems to undo the last cd.
[08:38] <Jimbo> nolimitsoya; done...not sure what just happened but a lot of text came up
[08:38] <tylerl> dsnyders: yeah, i like it!
[08:38] <psusi> bieb_work: cool
[08:38] <dsnyders> tylerl, I'll have to keep it in mind.

[08:38] <we2by> how do I configure to use my middle mouse button to paste stuff?
[08:38] <ubotu> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[08:38] <bieb_work> The system has 2 raids... the raid1 for OS and a raid3 for data storage (backup server)
[08:38] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, the line to add to your fstab would be '/dev/hdb1 /<full-patch-to-mount-point>  <filesystem-type> defaults 0 2'
[08:39] <darkx> ok i whanted to be shure so i tryed fsck again.. it gets the same problem..
[08:39] <tylerl> dsnyders: I tried to run tomcat but got an error, it said I haven't yet defined my java variables.  How would I do that in linux?
[08:39] <Doow> nolimitsoya, would be nice if I could use test it though, ie play sound from other than the default soundcard
[08:39] <psusi> bieb_work: raid3?
[08:39] <dsnyders> tylerl, BTW, http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ will give you a better background on the filesysem hierarchy than I can.
[08:39] <psusi> bieb_work: you mean raid5?
[08:39] <dv5237> does anyone know how i can open the gnome ftp client in a terminal? (so make the app start whit a gui from the terminal)
[08:39] <nolimitsoya> Doow, ive got no clue. tried man alsa?
[08:39] <tylerl> dsnyders: Okay.
[08:39] <darkx> 28:3f/30, 31:00/0f
[08:39] <liquidboy> when starting E16, i get not left click menu (no applications menu) anyone here of this problem before?
[08:40] <bieb_work> I just had to remove the raid3 drives so it wasnt seen during the install and grub warked fine.. once it was up and running, I was able to connect the disks back and it worked fine
[08:40] <dsnyders> tylerl,I don't know anything about java, except that I need it to view certain websites.
[08:40] <bieb_work> No Raid3 is correct
[08:40] <burrito10> i'm using openoffice2 in ubuntu edgy, and i can't get it to quickstart properly... i don't know the parameter for starting it on the tray, and even when i start it manually and select "enable quickstarter", when i restart my system the quickstarter isn't there... any ideas?
[08:40] <crocd> dv5237: gftp should do it
[08:40] <Doow> no, just the wiki and official site, some of it go way over my head and most is completely unrelated
[08:40] <tylerl> dsnyders: Okay, np, thank you.
[08:40] <psusi> bieb_work: there is no such thing as raid3
[08:40] <Doow> I'll keep on digging though
[08:40] <bieb_work> I am using a Netcell SPU card that supports raid3

[08:40] <soundray> burrito10: I'm not sure, but I think the quickstart concept has been abandoned.
[08:40] <psusi> bieb_work: there is raid0, 1, 5, and 4 is a retarded version of 5.. and there's 6
[08:40] <darkx> psusi : when i fsck again it says the same thing "Differences: (offset:original/backup)"
[08:40] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, did you get my last message?
[08:41] <dv5237> crocd: -bas "gftp" command not found.
[08:41] <Jimbo> molimit...i got a lot of static filesystem info in teminal now
[08:41] <psusi> darkx: you have to have the partition not mounted when you fsck it
[08:41] <dsnyders> tylerl, That, and it is a sysnonym for coffee, for which I feel a craving.  Time to plug in the kettle
[08:41] <Jadedwolf> Burritol0: I get The GStreamer plugins to decode "MP3" files cannot be found.
[08:41] <burrito10> soundray: well it comes included in oo2, and it works here... if i load an instance first, and until i restart the system  :(
[08:41] <Jadedwolf> do i need to install something
[08:41] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, yes, good
[08:41] <Jimbo> I dont see where to put that last string
[08:41] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, the line to add to your fstab would be '/dev/hdb1 /<full-patch-to-mount-point>  <filesystem-type> defaults 0 2'
[08:41] <darkx> it's not mounted
[08:41] <Doow> nolimitsoya, I followed both those, and the first one seems to be outdated on a lot of points and the other one unrelated, but I won't bug you any more
[08:41] <pj> i'm italian ;) and i use ubuntu 6.10
[08:41] <tylerl> dsnyders: haha
[08:41] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, just type that line in somewhere, on a new row
[08:41] <darkx> i umoted them manualy.. when i started...
[08:41] <psusi> darkx: then add the -f flag to fsck
[08:41] <crocd> dv5237: when you typ in gf and do tab completion what does it list?
[08:41] <pj> i've a problem with my ati...
[08:41] <xst> After upgrading to edgy, all the moutpoints listed in /etc/fstab are being mounted - even if they have a "noauto"-option. Why are they mounted and how can I disable this auto mounting?
[08:41] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo, then ctrl+x to exit, and awnser yes to saving the file
[08:42] <Jimbo> ok.
[08:42] <Daehlie> when can we expect a new version of xchat-gnome for edgy to fix the non nick bug?

[08:44] <tylerl> What file are global variables written to?  I would like to look at the variables I have assigned.

[09:25] <Nutubuntu> Sierra and nolimitsoya - looks like the pages you pointed me to will help. Do you know whether Mplayer uses the same backend as Totem (e.g., gstreamer and/or xine)? I'm more or less leaning toward Mplayer rather than Totem
[09:25] <john83> E: could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11 resource temporarily unavilable)

[09:25] <john83> wtf ?? ^^
[09:25] <jair> but if I want to add the default gw using the command ifconfig i think?
[09:25] <jair> it is in the live cd
[09:25] <jair> so I want to add it just for a temporary.

[09:27] <sobersabre> but the booting doesn't show it
[09:27] <Nutubuntu> Sierra, I tried VLC and rejected it, but I don't remember why. (I *think* b/c it wouldn't play some vid format I needed.) Mplayer does *most* of what I want, but I am having trouble with some video formats, and I am guessing it's probably a codec issue.
[09:27] <sgorilla80> packman_e: does it go away?
[09:27] <Jimbo> nolimitsoya, when i hit yes the fstab text disappeared and im back at jgh@Jgh-linux:~$ sudo nano /etc/fstab

[09:27] <Sierra> Nutubuntu, what are you trying to play?
[09:27] <sgorilla80> packman_e: you should remove usplash
[09:27] <Jimbo> i need at least 4 ibuprofin
[09:28] <strabes> packman_e: you can install the boot up manager (bum) and use it to disable some services from starting up. you can see what is wrong with ctrl+alt+f1 when it's booting i believe
[09:28] <bjorne> Sierra whats the problem with vlc
[09:28] <Nutubuntu> Sierra, nothing too tricky. It gives me weird output (kaleidoscope colors, no sound) on some .wmv files and some .mov files

[10:29] <slavik> jenda: not sure
[10:30] <mirak> http://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&ticketID=1131314  I sent a bug report to ATI about fglrx not enabling DRI when DRM_RADEON module is build into the kernel, and all what they reply is "we do not have linux support". They don't even support their OWN kernel module !!!!!! this is for radeon 9600 pro
[10:30] <jenda> oh well.
[10:30] <sgorilla80> mirak: wow, that is what i have...
[10:30] <cntb> !firefox

[10:31] <NemesisD> hey i have a quick twinview question, how do i get my panels (i think thats what they are called) to span across both monitors?
[10:31] <sgorilla80> packman_e: did you try the thing with knoppix?
[10:31] <moonwatcher> i seem to get this flat default controls style
[10:31] <mirak> sgorilla80: you have what ?
[10:31] <sgorilla80> mirak: that same card
[10:31] <JohnFlux> Nemesis: you could always create a second panel
[10:31] <JohnFlux> Nemesis: and put that on the other monitor
[10:31] <java1> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1753790#post1753790     someone please help abit
[10:31] <NemesisD> eh, i'd like at least the task bar to extend over both monitors
[10:32] <NemesisD> and im sure im inventing terms here
[10:32] <packman_e> sgorilla80: i am still downloading knoppix
[10:32] <mirak> sgorilla80: have you my bug report on lauchpad ?
[10:32] <sgorilla80> mirak: nope, i didnt try to install the ati drivers, i just use vesa, seemed to difficult and unsupported
[10:32] <JohnFlux> NemesisD: you can hide the fact that it's dual screen from kde
[10:32] <slavik> jenda: what do you need to do again?
[10:32] <Doops> Hi.. I'd like to dual boot XP and Ubuntu... I have XP installed already, I understand I need a NTFS partition for windows, an ext3 partition for ubuntu, and a FAT32 partition for shared files? Are there any other alternatives?
[10:32] <sgorilla80> packman_e: cool, what type of connection do you have?
[10:32] <JohnFlux> NemesisD: that would work, but would cause some bad side effects
[10:32] <sgorilla80> Doops: you dont need that
[10:32] <sgorilla80> Doops: you can read ext3 in windows
[10:32] <packman_e> sgorilla80: adsl 2meg

[10:33] <slavik> cat-a-log is the actual command you want?
[10:34] <Doops> so I should make two partitions and a swap file
[10:34] <Doops> swap*
[10:34] <slavik> jenda: with alias you can't force or detect if the argument was empty or not
[10:34] <JohnFlux> NemesisD: don't know
[10:34] <slavik> a script would do it
[10:34] <packman_e> sgorilla80: wow lucky for some!, what is your average download rate. my max is about 220kb
[10:34] <Doops> and put all my mp3s/movies etc on the ext3 partition?
[10:34] <mirak> sgorilla80: actually you don't need to install the driver, it's in linux restricted modules, but the problem remains the same
[10:34] <slavik> cat-a-lot would have to be a script

[10:41] <Virtuall> Gercel, I havent read that one... are you on live or installed?
[10:41] <Skyrail> Really easy question, but I want to move a file or save a file in a folder that is protected and can only be saved to by root, how to I save to it on my account?
[10:41] <Virtuall> IsergeiV, #ubuntu-ru ?
[10:41] <Gercel> Virtuall: Live.
[10:42] <stefan> Skyrail: change the permissions
[10:42] <Virtuall> Gercel, well that tutorial is for installed as i understand
[10:42] <Skyrail> stefan: will I have to login as root and change its permissions?
[10:42] <stefan> yes
[10:42] <stefan> of course
[10:42] <blind> Skyrail: no
[10:42] <slavik> jenda: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31529/
[10:42] <Skyrail> oh...
[10:42] <jenda> slavik: same thing...
[10:42] <blind> use sudo
[10:42] <jenda> ah, thx
[10:42] <blind> sudo = per line root
[10:43] <stefan> blind: sudo makes you becoming root ;-)
[10:43] <Gercel> Virtuall: Arhhhh :D. Any tips for a live version or is it not posible?
[10:43] <Virtuall> Gercel, try opening a terminal and writing: sudo mount /dev/sda2
[10:43] <blind> stefan: no, it doesn't.
[10:43] <saleh> which packages r used 4compiling openGL code???i wrote my own code but compiler tells me "GL/glut.h no such a file or directory, what should i do???"
[10:43] <Skyrail> blind: ok, I know there is the sudo command, but how do I move a file from one place to another using the terminal then?
[10:43] <stefan> blind: but what`s the big difference
[10:43] <blind> Skyrail: sudo mv <file> <destination>
[10:43] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Skyrail about cli
[10:43] <Skyrail> blind: thanks :)
[10:43] <Gercel> mount: /dev/sda2 already mounted or /media/sda2 busy
[10:43] <Gercel> mount: according to mtab, /dev/sda2 is already mounted on /media/sda2
[10:44] <Skyrail> LjL: thanks as well :)
[10:44] <easytiger> rm -rf ~/
[10:44] <LjL> blind, yes, it does
[10:44] <BrightEyes`> anyone who uses the windows manager Oroboros? anyone to give me the source paths for adept to download OrobotOSX ?

[10:44] <saleh> which packages r used 4compiling openGL code???i wrote my own code but compiler tells me "GL/glut.h no such a file or directory, what should i do???"
[10:44] <BrightEyes`> ivan : OroborOSX... window manager
[10:44] <Gercel> Virtuall: You are a ledged. As for me, I'm very very think!  ha
[10:44] <Gercel> :D
[10:45] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, that sounds like a mac os x question
[10:45] <ivan> never heard of that one...
[10:45] <entel> hi, i have a problem http://pastebin.ca/247778
[10:45] <Gercel> Virtuall: Many thanks. :D

[10:45] <rgg> hey gus I can't fix the resolution issue, it keeps giving me only up to 800x600
[10:45] <stefan> saleh: mabe asking google...
[10:45] <rgg> is there ans easy way to set it up right
[10:45] <easytiger> <LjL>: someone asked how to remove everythign from their home directory
[10:45] <Virtuall> Gercel, em, i didn't understand you, but you're welcome :D
[10:46] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, well if you're trying to use oroborOSX (which is the mac os x port of oroborus) then it has nothing to do with ubuntu or linux.
[10:46] <mkuziak> I downloaded Ubuntu 6.10 and successfully burned it to a CD, but it won't install the new version over my old one.  The screen shows some activity at the outset, but eventually goes blank.  What is wrong?
[10:46] <BrightEyes`> eobanb : why??? i can find it source code in tar.gz
[10:46] <BrightEyes`> isnt that the same?
[10:46] <BrightEyes`> it = its
[10:46] <mc__> mkuziak, what screen?
[10:46] <Virtuall> mkuziak, are you sure you should do that?
[10:46] <apokryphos> easytiger: where and who?
[10:47] <LjL> easytiger, i haven't seen anyone asking that. at any rate, you should give BIG HUGE warnings before typing something like that. where was it asked anyway?
[10:47] <saleh> stefan: is my question is basic??? if so, sorry bc i'm new in linux world...
[10:47] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, please listen.  oroborus is an X11 environment for MAC OS X, NOT LINUX
[10:47] <eobanb> er, oroborOSX, BrianG
[10:47] <eobanb> BrightEyes`,
[10:47] <BrightEyes`> eobanb : any similar to it?
[10:47] <mkuziak> I am using an lcd monitor. Sceptre: 800x600 res.
[10:47] <danman> hello all
[10:47] <apokryphos> hi
[10:47] <BrianG> ...
[10:47] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, oroborus is in universe
[10:47] <stefan> saleh: no, it`s definetly not basic, but I don`t think somebody can help you here
[10:48] <jenda> slavik: hey - thanks a bunch. I had to tweak it a bit, but now it works like a charm.
[10:48] <eobanb> BrianG, sorry, i meant BrightEyes`, not you.
[10:48] <BrightEyes`> eobanb what do you mean "is in universe" ?
[10:48] <entel> someone know how solve it? abou kernel compilation http://pastebin.ca/247778
[10:48] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=oroborus&searchon=names&subword=1&version=edgy&release=all
[10:48] <saleh> stefan: ok, thx anyway...
[10:48] <Virtuall> mkuziak, is it *completely* blank or with a cursor blinking?
[10:48] <moonwatcher> ever since i upgraded to edgy i get this tiny gnome logo on the file manager corner? i even tried a fresh install :( doesn anyone know how to resolve this?
[10:48] <stefan> saleh: maybe you look for a OpenGL chanel
[10:48] <mc__> saleh, you should searhc for somethin like libgl-dev
[10:48] <owen_> if i restart my computer with torrent windows open, will they load back up themselves?
[10:48] <danman> can any one tell me how to get my sound to work. i'm using a Soundblaster X-Fi
[10:49] <mkuziak> just before the screen went blank there was a blinking cursor for a few seconds.
[10:49] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, next time instead of asking about some mac os x crap you can at least apt-cache search for the package.
[10:49] <mc__> saleh, i think you need libgl1-mesa-dev
[10:49] <bobovski> hi all. With a free service like dyndns can I set up a mail server?
[10:49] <Virtuall> mkuziak, i'd say you shouldn't install obne ubuntu over another
[10:49] <bobovski> secondarily, how is this done in ubuntu?
[10:49] <eobanb> bobovski, if your ISP doesnt block SMTP, then sure.
[10:50] <eobanb> if they do, you might be out of luck
[10:50] <BrightEyes`> eobanb edgy (x11): A lightweight themeable windowmanager for X [universe] 
[10:50] <Virtuall> mkuziak, from the live cd, remove all the directories except "home" from the harddrive
[10:50] <BrightEyes`> 2.0.18: amd64 i386 powerpc
[10:50] <mkuziak> virtual:  thanks.  I thought that might be a problem.
[10:50] <Virtuall> mkuziak, and then install 6.10
[10:50] <bobovski> eobanb: lemme check the TOS
[10:50] <mc__> saleh,please let me not if that did help
[10:50] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, yes i can read too
[10:50] <BrightEyes`> powerpc.i cant install it.i have an amd cpu.
[10:50] <gray_fox> join #ubuntu-it
[10:50] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, !?!?!
[10:50] <BrightEyes`> eobanb and mac is not crap.it 's maybe one of the best computers out there
[10:50] <mkuziak> virtuall:  thanks again for the followup procedure.
[10:51] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, it's for amd64, i386, and powerpc
[10:51] <bobovski> eobanb: ok, I can't find it quickly. If my ISP doesn't have SMTP blocked, what do I do next?
[10:51] <cntb> quick resolution change in ubuntu ? KDE kubuntu?
[10:51] <eobanb> BrightEyes`, and i have a mac too, FYI
[10:51] <coz_> BrightEyes`, mac sucks ... only my opinion
[10:51] <saleh> mc_: thx but it dont...
[10:51] <mc__> BrianG, mac is normal pc,which is more expensive
[10:51] <mc__> saleh, still same error?

[10:52] <NemesisD> woo

[10:53] <mc__> saleh,  and libglu1-mesa-dev

[10:55] <Lars_G> mc__: I just hope it's a worthy successor to OpenFirmware, I will miss forth terribly though
[10:55] <apokryphos> NChief: I just remove all other resolutions as options then it's forced into it
[10:55] <packman_e> sgorilla80: 12 mins left until d/l finishes
[10:55] <mc__> BrightEyes`, it seems that you dont know what you are talkin about,you can buy a normal pc with exact the same hardware as the MacPro has but for less money
[10:55] <NChief> apokryphos: where can i do that?
[10:55] <eobanb> Lars_G, BrightEyes` mc__ take this to -offtopic now please.
[10:56] <mc__> Lars_G, EFI doesnt use Forth any more?
[10:56] <apokryphos> NChief: either edit xorg.conf manually or do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:56] <ivan> NChief : It'll automatically choose largest resolution in xorg.conf
[10:56] <mc__> eobanb, we're already finished
[10:56] <NChief> apokryphos, ivan: ok, thanx :)

[10:57] <eobanb> imme-emosol, unless you have some very unusual hardware i'd expect the install process to go just fine.  try out the liveCD and see if things work.
[10:57] <BrightEyes`> mc__ i dont know. maybe now isnt the appropriete time to discuss CISC/RISC ...sorry
[10:57] <imme-emosol> eobanb, They don't.

[10:58] <LjL> mc__, BrightEyes`: another option is to use the nice friendly #ubuntu-offtopic channel, where there are 127 people ready to discuss all kinds of architectures
[10:58] <The_Belgain> do they still live in the same place as before (i.e. in init.d) or are those deprecated now that we have the new upstart system?

[10:58] <trukosh1> zege nmap?
[10:59] <ompaul> zege, this is an english language channel
[10:59] <zege> sorry :(
[10:59] <imme-emosol> eobanb, It's 5.10... I only have a kubuntu install cd for 6.10 and that doesn't work at all and I didn't know how to get into console mode with that installCD, so...   (I still don't)
[10:59] <The_Belgain> i just want to add an extra script to be run at startup (to start a tftp server, and a litening vlc)
[10:59] <newbuntu> can anyone help me with a dvd authoring issue? I have several DVD authoring programs, I can copy a dvd, convert an avi to dvd or svcd etc etc, but what I cant seem to do is author a dvd with menus and 3 or 4 different movies on it...
[10:59] <eobanb> imme-emosol, i suggest you download the LTS server install disc and try that.
[10:59] <neobyte420> hello room
[11:00] <eobanb> newbuntu, what software?
[11:00] <trappist> The_Belgain: look at /etc/rc.local
[11:00] <MenZaLap> Just wondering, is there any way to configure what Ubuntu does when the lid of my laptop closes?
[11:00] <MenZaLap> Currently it goes into standby
[11:00] <LjL> miojo, dunno if it's the best possible idea, but something like "lsof | grep <username> | wc -l" should probably work
[11:00] <neobyte420> where can i go to get some help for ubuntu?
[11:00] <slavik> jenda: did you see the code?
[11:01] <imme-emosol> eobanb, Okay thanks...   I haven't got a burning prossibility a.t.m. but I will try that then...
[11:01] <newbuntu> ive tried tovid, qdvdauthor, kde dvd atuthor,
[11:01] <LjL> neobyte420: here
[11:01] <The_Belgain> so that's executed as the very last step of booting - regardless of the runlevel?
[11:01] <slavik> !ask | neobyte420
[11:01] <ubotu> neobyte420: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:01] <danboid> Is there a repository with lxdvdrip for edgy?
[11:01] <nickspoon> ugh.
[11:01] <The_Belgain> is it exectured only once even if multiple users are autologgedin?
[11:01] <schiavoni> how can I register my nick ?
[11:01] <miojo> LjL, theres a program that I cant remember, but it summarizes the count of open files per user
[11:01] <jenda> slavik: of the script? yes - I altered it.
[11:01] <neobyte420> coool ty LjL, slavik & ubotu
[11:01] <ompaul> !register | schiavoni
[11:01] <slavik> schiavoni: /msg nickserv help register
[11:01] <ubotu> schiavoni: Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[11:01] <eobanb> newbuntu, you might try also asking in the channels and on the forums for those applications
[11:01] <neobyte420> My question is ...
[11:01] <slavik> jenda: did you get the gist of it?
[11:01] <danboid> newbuntu: whats the prob?
[11:01] <newbuntu> qdvdauthor wont recognize an mpeg2 dvd movie freshly converted by devede
[11:01] <trappist> miojo: might also look into fuser
[11:01] <slavik> jenda: is your modified script under GPL?
[11:02] <slavik> jenda: I want the modified script. :)
[11:02] <jenda> slavik: yep :) thx a bunch. I'm working on alternate versions: cat-a-chan (which is uses tail instead of cat), grep-a-log and grep-a-chan...
[11:02] <slavik> jenda: they all have to be GPL ^^
[11:02] <jenda> slavik: it's under the GPL whether I like it or not.
[11:02] <newbuntu> II am trying to take ..say..4 avi movies, convert them to mpeg and author a dvd with menu buttons for each movie
[11:02] <neobyte420> I was installing CSS in wine on my ubuntu system.  I got to the part were it said to change to CD2 but the cdrom was busy and wouldn't eject
[11:02] <slavik> yes ...
[11:02] <nickspoon> can anyone tell me why glxgears is using 40% CPU with direct rendering: Yes in glxinfo, the latest nvidia driver from amaranth's repository, and an nVidia 7600GS?
[11:02] <slavik> your scripts
[11:02] <danboid> newbuntu: ack! Sorry, never tried the menu thing
[11:02] <neobyte420> how can i work around that
[11:02] <slavik> which derive from mine :)
=== schiavoni is now known as vschiavoni
[11:03] <jenda> slavik: actually - no :) If I don't release them, they don't have to be GPL
[11:03] <eobanb> slavik, the GPL doesnt mandate distribution in the first place, only the terms of the (optional) distribution.
[11:03] <imme-emosol> eobanb, Thanks for your time. ;)   I like ubuntu-community. :D
[11:03] <jenda> slavik: but since I will, they are. lemme paste.
[11:03] <Amaranth> nickspoon: glxgears is designed to run as fast as possible
[11:03] <Amaranth> nickspoon: iow, it's supposed to do that
[11:03] <newbuntu> copying a dvd is easy, converting an avi to dvd is easy, putting more than one movie on a disk with menus is hard
[11:03] <neobyte420> I have more questions to
[11:03] <neobyte420> How do i share out a printer on my LAN?
[11:03] <nickspoon> Amaranth: I'm fairly sure it's meant to use little or no cpu at all.
[11:03] <nickspoon> plus I only get 4000 fps.
[11:04] <slavik> jenda's scripts are derivative of my GPL'ed script, therefore he has to acknowledge my work and his work must be released and made available under the GPL :)
[11:04] <eobanb> 'only' 4000 fps?
[11:04] <eobanb> ...
=== DrPepperKid is now known as MacSlow
[11:04] <Amaranth> nickspoon: it's always used lots of CPU here and I only get 2100 fps
[11:04] <nickspoon> Amaranth: what video card?
[11:04] <trukosh1> neobyte420, cups + samba would be a possibility.
[11:04] <Amaranth> nickspoon: If you think something is broken the place to go is the nvnews.net forums
[11:04] <neobyte420> can someone please massage me plz
[11:04] <eobanb> nickspoon, can your eyes differentiate between 4000 and 5000 fps? no, they cant.
[11:04] <Amaranth> nickspoon: go 7400
[11:04] <jenda> slavik: nooo, I theoretically can keep them secret, as if I did'nt change them at all. But _if_ I release, it's gotta be under GPL.
[11:04] <neobyte420> trukosh1 : ty
[11:04] <danboid> anyone know of lxdvdrip packages for edgy?
[11:05] <Flannel> slavik, jenda, take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[11:05] <neobyte420> i have it connected to my server and it uses cups
[11:05] <jenda> Flannel: ok
[11:05] <slavik> neobyte420: why don't you install just steam, then log into your account and install that way or simply copy the appcache stuff
[11:05] <slavik> jenda: agreed ...
[11:05] <Amaranth> nickspoon: test in a real GL app to see if it's slower, glxgears is _worthless_ as a benchmark
[11:05] <neobyte420> slavik, thats a great idea ty
[11:05] <ivan> Does anyone here know of Democracyplayer ?
[11:05] <nickspoon> Amaranth: indeed, the developers do like making that point clear :)
[11:06] <slavik> Amaranth: I found that glxgears gave me the same output on my main system with and without direct rendering
[11:06] <Amaranth> nickspoon: glxgears -iacknowledgethisisnotabenchmark :)
[11:06] <neobyte420> brb afk
[11:06] <slavik> but on my laptop, the result is noticable greatly
[11:06] <nickspoon> haha, yup :)
[11:06] <ivan> I've installed DemocracyPlayer plus all possible codecs, but still get no sound...
[11:06] <newbuntu> has anyone in here authored a dvd with menus?
[11:06] <slavik> newbuntu: on windows ...
[11:07] <Amaranth> newbuntu: only with nero on windows
[11:07] <Amaranth> newbuntu: it's certainly possible on linux but there are no GUI tools for it
[11:07] <newbuntu> slavick im willing to use a windows program through wine
[11:07] <newbuntu> im that desperate  lol
[11:07] <LjL> Amaranth, not quite
[11:07] <eobanb> perhaps nerolinux can do what you want, newbuntu .
[11:07] <braindead> i need help!
[11:07] <eobanb> !ask
[11:07] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:08] <newbuntu> dvdauthor has a gui, but for one its buggy and for 2 you cant drag avi files over like it says you can
[11:08] <newbuntu> thanks
[11:08] <braindead> im unsure how to compile a few programs
[11:08] <eobanb> braindead, what do you need to compile?
[11:08] <Amaranth> afaik nerolinux doesn't include nero showtime
[11:08] <LjL> braindead: are you sure you need to compile them, in the first place?
[11:08] <braindead> limewire and xmms
[11:08] <slavik> newbuntu: TMPGEnc DVD Author ...
[11:08] <newbuntu> i'm not sure if nero linux can make menus etc
[11:08] <eobanb> sigh.
[11:08] <eobanb> !limewire
[11:08] <ubotu> limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.
[11:08] <LjL> !info xmms | braindead

[11:08] <newbuntu> slavik i'll try it
[11:08] <ivan> Can anyone tell me how to get sound in democracyplayer ??? I have all imaginable codecs, but still can't get any...
[11:09] <braindead> i'm kinda new
[11:09] <braindead> do i get java the same way
[11:09] <Flannel> !java | braindead
[11:09] <ubotu> braindead: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[11:10] <LjL> braindead: you should familiarize yourself with the packaging system for starters
[11:10] <newbuntu> hey slav is that TMPGEnc a windows program?
[11:10] <regeya> tmpgenc is a windows program.
[11:10] <eobanb> it's amazing to me that users install a system without knowing *anything* about how it works beforehand.
[11:10] <neobyte420> ok i installed steam i think
[11:11] <pianoboy3333> I need a good cd ripping program, equivilent to sound juicer, but that which uses the cddb
[11:11] <neobyte420> i have a gnome foot on my ubuntu desktop now
[11:11] <trappist> pianoboy3333: I like abcde and grip
[11:11] <neobyte420> do i just run it with wine?
[11:11] <entel> argh
[11:11] <entel> !
[11:11] <ladydoor> pianoboy3333: i find crip to be very helpful, and it's small (just being a script and calling an external editor)
[11:11] <pianoboy3333> crip...?
[11:11] <regeya> eobanb: it amazes me too...back when I started with Slackware, tho, I had to do my research just to get the darn thing installed :-}
[11:12] <trappist> pianoboy3333: ... grip
[11:12] <pianoboy3333> oh
[11:12] <trappist> oh nm :)
[11:12] <ladydoor> trappist: both exist. i'm recommending crip
[11:12] <trappist> he said crip
[11:12] <ladydoor> trappist: um. she
[11:12] <trappist> ladydoor: gotcha

[11:12] <trappist> ladydoor: and gotcha :)

[11:12] <kaptengu> hello, which key is the <Super>-key?
[11:12] <eobanb> kaptengu, generally the Windows key.
[11:12] <trappist> kaptengu: on mine it's the penguin key :)
[11:13] <eobanb> kaptengu, or it's the command key.
[11:13] <LjL> on mine it's the key with no print on it anymore. but then most of them have no print on them anymore
[11:13] <kaptengu> can I set <Fn> to be the <Super>-key?
[11:13] <regeya> not on an ubuntu machine right now, but I have a command key (generic mac kbd)
[11:13] <neobyte420> i have some more questions...
[11:13] <kaptengu> I don't have a windows-key
[11:13] <trappist> kaptengu: I had to do this in my xorg.conf: Option      "XkbOptions" "altwin:super_win"  <-- yours will differ, but I don't know exactly what it'll be
[11:13] <eobanb> kaptengu, thinkpad?
[11:13] <regeya> 'command key' is a good catch-all; on my machine at home, I have the Windows key set to 'meta'
[11:13] <neobyte420> How can I get YahVox to work for Wine on Ubuntu?
[11:14] <kaptengu> eobanb: thinkpad yes
[11:14] <eobanb> neobyte420, check the appdb on winehq.com
[11:14] <eobanb> kaptengu, what do you even need it for?
[11:14] <eobanb> the windows key, that is
[11:14] <kaptengu> beryl
[11:14] <neobyte420> i got yahelite to work but the yahvox  wont connect to the voice server
[11:14] <cafuego> Oh, the candy key!
[11:15] <LjL> cafuego: or the yakuake key for that matter ;-P oh wait, that's still candy
[11:15] <regeya> I make Mac-heads mad by calling the command key the 'apple key'
[11:15] <entel> kernel maricon haha
[11:16] <regeya> sorry, they were called 'open apple' and 'closed apple' on Apple 2s
[11:16] <eobanb> regeya, i remember
[11:16] <trappist> regeya: that takes me back :)
[11:17] <eobanb> grrrr, i hate that gnome-look is down
[11:17] <eobanb> oh, wait, it's back
[11:17] <skymt0> regeya: Apple calls it the apple key now, in documentation
[11:17] <danboid> Is there a site like apt-get.org where I can search for ubuntu packages in 3rd party repositories?

[11:19] <neobyte420> eobanb, whats that link for?
[11:19] <einPaule> would you (anyone reading this that has worked with xubuntu (or at least seen it)) say that it is more intuitive to a PC newbie (that has not done more with windows than seen it)
[11:19] <LjL> tempted: besides, the syntax is /msg NickServ IDENTIFY <password> - and do it in the status window next time... with a different password, that is
[11:20] <einPaule> than ubuntu or kubuntu?
[11:20] <danboid> That link is for breezy lxdvdrip packages
[11:20] <neobyte420> it doesn't seem relavent to any of my questions
[11:20] <neobyte420> ty though
[11:20] <eobanb> neobyte420, oh, sorry, wrong person
[11:20] <danboid> I'm running edgy
[11:20] <preaction> einPaule, no, ubuntu (Gnome) i would call the most intuitive
[11:20] <regeya> einPaule: if you're a Windows user, I'll get killed for saying this, but I'd recommend kubuntu
[11:20] <neobyte420> oh ok sorry
[11:20] <preaction> einPaule, xubuntu is definately NOT intuitive, and afaik is not designed to be.
[11:21] <Virtuall> einPaule, add +1 for Gnome :)
[11:21] <neobyte420> Is there a reason why ignore doesn't work on gyachi?
[11:21] <regeya> preaction: it's a little more intuitive as of edgy, but I agree (and I use xubuntu!)
[11:21] <eobanb> neobyte420, you know there are many other yahoo messenger clients right?
[11:21] <skymt0> danboid: the instructions are for breezy, but the site links to the author's .debs, which should work on edgy

[11:22] <ITSa341> good evening, can someone recommend a good cpanel alternative that is easily installed on Ubuntu?
[11:22] <regeya> preaction, but you'll have to agree that Thunar is nice, eh?
[11:22] <einPaule> (Its not for me, Im a semi-happy ubuntu user ;-) )
[11:22] <neobyte420> problem is that the ignore doesn't work
[11:22] <preaction> ITSa341, webmin i believe, is the free "alternative"
[11:22] <regeya> cpanel?
[11:22] <LjL> !webmin | preaction, ITSa341
[11:22] <ubotu> preaction, ITSa341: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
[11:22] <regeya> ITSa341: cpanel?
[11:22] <neobyte420> i was hoping that yahelite running the yahvox through wine on my ubuntu would help
[11:22] <preaction> regeya, Thunar is nice, it's fast and responsive. it just doesn't seem to interact with the automounting as well as i'd like
[11:22] <neobyte420> so far no luck
[11:23] <BrianG>

[11:23] <neobyte420> on another note...where should i begin if i want to become great at linux?
[11:23] <danboid> sounds like cpanel should be platform independent then
[11:24] <kmaynard> HA! i beat LjL...must be a first ;)
[11:24] <richy_> hi
[11:24] <Nukez> if my wifi card is already detected I wont need to download drivers right?

[11:24] <richy_> worked  :P but i entered the password wrong
[11:24] <kmaynard> :P
[11:24] <richy_> so i cant login
[11:24] <preaction> imho the entire idea of web-based administration is horrible. use a ssh.
[11:24] <richy_> how can i fix that?
[11:24] <stefan> neobyte420: build your own Kernel
[11:24] <preaction> richy_, delete the user and try again
[11:24] <LjL> richy_: sudo passwd username
[11:24] <richy_> preacton: how? im not really pro :P
[11:24] <neobyte420> ive heard that on b4 stefan
[11:24] <printk> rickyfingers__: sudo passwd username (of coure login as a user you know you can login as)
[11:24] <cafuego> richy_: 'sudo passwd <newusername>' will ask you reset the password.
[11:24] <preaction> richy_, do what LjL said
[11:25] <skymt0> preaction: agree 100%
[11:25] <neobyte420> thanx
[11:25] <eobanb> preaction, you know it doesnt work so well in an enterprise environment with tons of vservers
[11:25] <stefan> neobyte420: and have you done it?
[11:25] <preaction> eobanb, how so? there are ways to run centralized configuration servers
[11:25] <richy_> ah thx :D
[11:25] <skymt0> eobanb: try dsh
[11:25] <cafuego> eobanb: scripting ssh to work on all servers at once isn't that hard :-)
[11:26] <skymt0> eobanb: dsh allows you to run ssh commands on a list of servers
[11:26] <eobanb> uhhhh..
[11:26] <eobanb> i'm talking about vservers.
[11:26] <neobyte420> stefan, no i dont know where to begin
[11:26] <eobanb> apache vservers.
[11:26] <saxin> what is the command to get graphic "sudo".. I know it's a strange question.. something like gksudo or something :P
[11:26] <eobanb> not 'different physical boxes'
[11:26] <neobyte420> maybe i have...whats it like?
[11:26] <LjL> saxin: yes, it is gksudo
[11:26] <skymt0> eobanb: oh. in that case, webmin or ehcp.
[11:26] <neobyte420> i have installed a bunch of different distros though
[11:27] <eobanb> yes, exactly, skymt0 .
[11:27] <stefan> neobyte420: download the Kernel source
[11:27] <cafuego> eobanb: As far as the locked ssh users are concerned, they have a different box here <heh>
[11:27] <neobyte420> ok
[11:27] <saxin> LjL: how do I use it? do I write it in a terminal in the "run"? :p
[11:27] <stefan> neobyte420: from kernel.org for example
[11:27] <saxin> or*
[11:27] <cafuego> eobanb: All a metter of setup.
[11:27] <neobyte420> ok ill check it out
[11:28] <LjL> saxin: i don't know what you mean with that. anyway, you can type it in any command line - a shell, alt+f2, a VT, whatever you like
[11:28] <nuts> hey
[11:28] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell saxin about sudo
[11:28] <neobyte420> but how is building my own kernal going to make me better at linux
[11:28] <stefan> neobyte420: there are many goog docs out there
[11:28] <SirKillalot_> how do I link my project with i.e. SDL with anjuta 2?
[11:28] <cafuego> neobyte420: It's not.
[11:28] <skymt0> LjL: gksudo will only work in a VT if you set DISPLAY
[11:28] <neobyte420> i have a bunch of ebooks on linux...i guess i should get reading
[11:28] <LjL> true skymt0
[11:28] <we2by> any one likes to recommend a LaTex tool?
[11:29] <neobyte420> i managed to set up my own LAN with ubuntu
[11:29] <neobyte420> DHCP server and all
[11:29] <skymt0> we2by: what kind of LaTeX tool? LyX is nice.
[11:29] <neobyte420> NAT
[11:29] <we2by> congrat neobyte420
[11:29] <eobanb> good to hear, neobyte420
[11:29] <neobyte420> ty ty
[11:29] <cafuego> neobyte420: It will teach you about which parts of the ekrnel are essential for booting and which parts are not. it's up to you whether that info is of any use whatsoever :-)
[11:29] <we2by> skymt0: Lyx is not really LaTex
[11:29] <neobyte420> i still have a long way to go
[11:29] <we2by> I think I'm gonna use tetex
[11:29] <we2by> btw, Lyx is slow
[11:29] <trappist> neobyte420: sounds like the hard part's done :)
[11:29] <skymt0> we2by: tetex is also good ;-)
[11:30] <neobyte420> cafuego, I know about the dir setup for linux already tho
[11:30] <dxdemetriou> anybody knows if is there similar of krdc for gnome?
[11:30] <stefan> neobyte420: just google a manual on how to build your kernel
[11:30] <we2by> yea, but I need a nice editor to increase my productivity
[11:30] <saxin> LjL: when I try to write it, I get this: "Missing command to run."
[11:30] <neobyte420> i can get around good...but i really want to push it to the next levels
[11:30] <neobyte420> ok ill look into it
[11:30] <nuts> hm, where can I remove the mounted harddisc drives from desktop guys?
[11:30] <LjL> saxin: of course. it's just like sudo, you need to tell it what to run.
[11:30] <nuts> anyone knows?
[11:30] <SirKillalot_> anyone here using anjuta?
[11:31] <stefan> neobyte420: it`s not that complicated though
[11:31] <skymt0> we2by: look up winefish, a LaTeX editor based on bluefish
[11:31] <cafuego> oooh
[11:31] <neobyte420> stefan, it looks cool
[11:31] <saxin> LjL: Well, if I want the File Browser, what is it called?
[11:31] <we2by> thx
[11:31] <shingalated> anyone know how to run 32bit apps on a 64bit kernel?
[11:31] <neobyte420> i like the prepakaged linux distros though
[11:31] <trappist> saxin: nautilus
[11:31] <LjL> saxin: nautilus
[11:31] <neobyte420> i really am impressed with Ubuntu
[11:31] <cafuego> shingalated: chroot is your friend
[11:31] <wheelswitch> gday guys, i keep getting a seek error on one of my drives, what should i do?
[11:31] <stefan> neobyte420: there are even grafical interfaces to configure it
[11:31] <trappist> shingalated: yes, chroot
[11:31] <shingalated> what's chroot?
[11:32] <trappist> !chroot | shingalated
[11:32] <ubotu> shingalated: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot use this to build 32 bit environments on a 64 bit box
[11:32] <neobyte420> i was messing with gentoo but couldn't get it to startx
[11:32] <cafuego> wheelswitch: copy the data off, replace it with a not broken drive or replce the cable with a not broken one.
[11:32] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell nuts about icons
[11:32] <protocol1> neobyte420, same here..
[11:32] <wheelswitch> cafuego:  so the drive is broken?
[11:32] <neobyte420> i had a slackware 10.1 system for awhile
[11:32] <neobyte420> and ZenWalk
[11:32] <cafuego> wheelswitch: Either it or the (s)ata cable, probably.
[11:32] <neobyte420> but i like Ubuntu best of all
[11:32] <phanter> hi there. I try to connect to my wireless lan, but it does not work. At my parents place it does work. I do not know what is wrong :-(
[11:33] <neobyte420> i like the knoppix distros to
[11:33] <protocol1> yes
[11:33] <Keyseir> What's a good text editor that isn't quite as arcane as emacs or vi but still has very high functionality?
[11:33] <cafuego> Keyseir: vim
[11:33] <protocol1> gets better with every release
[11:33] <printk> Keyseir: vim ? :)
[11:33] <stefan> neobyte420: Gentoo is nice though
[11:33] <skymt0> Keyseir: scite, jedit, gedit, kate
[11:33] <Keyseir> !ubotu vim
[11:33] <ubotu> Text Editors: gedit (GNOME), Kate (KDE), vi/vim (terminal-based), terminal based: vi/vim, emacs, nano (user-friendly). HTML/CSS editors: !html; Programming: !code
[11:33] <cafuego> Keyseir: If you wanted a gui, use bluefish.
[11:33] <stefan> neobyte420: slim and clean...
[11:33] <neobyte420> i have used Knoppix, STD knoppix, Backtrack, Autitor, Operator, and some others
[11:33] <mixandgo> hello, any idea why there is no hdspmixer in my ubuntu ?
[11:33] <neobyte420> i want a fully loaded linux system
[11:34] <printk> mixandgo: cause you didn't install it?
[11:34] <neobyte420> not to heavy though
[11:34] <wheelswitch> cafuego:  it is a fairly new drive still under warrenty, ill check the cable
[11:34] <mixandgo> printk, where is it ?
[11:34] <neobyte420> i like the "apt-get' command
[11:34] <cafuego> wheelswitch: *nod*
[11:34] <neobyte420> i hear its "yum" for redhat and others
[11:34] <phanter> why is it that my wireless does not recognise any networks here, but windows does?
[11:34] <cafuego> wheelswitch: a 3rd possibility is the controller.
[11:34] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell neobyte420 about apt
[11:34] <printk> mixandgo: i think it's in alsa-tools-gui package
[11:35] <stefan> neobyte420: the emerge command is as easy to use
[11:35] <shingalated> this chroot stuff looks complicated
[11:35] <mixandgo> printk, thank you
[11:35] <RegalEagle> For Kubuntu desktop: What's the difference in gdm and kdm?
[11:35] <LjL> RegalEagle: one uses the Gnome libraries, the other uses the KDE libraries. and besides that, well, they're different.
[11:35] <nuts> thanx LjL
[11:35] <neobyte420> so Ubuntu is a debian clone i here
[11:35] <shingalated> im trying to get the mysql-admin to run on an amd64 and I keep getting segmentation fault
[11:35] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell neobyte420 about debian
[11:35] <RegalEagle> So, uh, which do you recommend?
[11:35] <crimsun> neobyte420: not close.
[11:35] <neobyte420> i hear BSD is a Unix clone
[11:36] <LjL> neobyte420: BSD *is* a Unix
[11:36] <skymt0> neobyte420: yes, it's heavily based on debian. it syncs with deb unstable after each release
[11:36] <wheelswitch> cafuego:  it is set up as a usb drive
[11:36] <RegalEagle> I'll choose kdm, I guess
[11:36] <regeya> neobyte420: very good, bsd is a unix derivative, actually.
[11:36] <neobyte420> ty
[11:36] <wheelswitch> is there any way i can test it? cafuego ?
[11:36] <neobyte420> im learning alot
[11:36] <mrynit> http://digg.com/videos_comedy/Testicular_Ephantitis
[11:36] <cafuego> wheelswitch: 'badblocks' perhaps...
[11:36] <neobyte420> i need a firewall i think
[11:36] <eobanb> mrynit, please leave.
[11:37] <neobyte420> i tried firestarter but it fails
[11:37] <stefan> neobyte420: not really
[11:37] <cafuego> wheelswitch: Have a search through 'apt-cache search disk test'
[11:37] <neobyte420> stefan, no not really i dont need a firewall?
[11:37] <WebGuest> Hey, whats up with this Feisty Fawn Drake Dapper and Edgy Eft stuff...is this some alliteration tradition with ubuntu?
[11:37] <stefan> neobyte420: just use secure software
[11:37] <LjL> WebGuest: yes
[11:37] <eobanb> WebGuest, ...?
[11:37] <RegalEagle> It's the codename for the versions
[11:37] <eobanb> WebGuest, they're just nicknames
[11:37] <skymt0> neobyte420: no you don't need a firewall. see http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/security#firewallantivirus
[11:37] <WebGuest> what was before Drake Dapper?
[11:37] <neobyte420> I do stefan ...but im worried about getting hacked on linux
[11:37] <printk> WebGuest: just codenames, going up through the alphabet
[11:37] <nuts> hum, this may sound somewhat strange, but is there a site which gives an overview over windowmanagers with screenshots??
[11:38] <Dralid> I just installed Edgy on a new hard drive, but now I cannot see my old hard drive from my fresh edgy install, and I cannot find Drives in the Administration menu. (My old drive is plugged into SATA2 on the motherboard, and is recognized by BIOS). How can I get to the files on the old drive?
[11:38] <LjL> WebGuest: Breezy Badger
[11:38] <eobanb> !versions
[11:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about versions - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:38] <eobanb> eh.
[11:38] <neobyte420> ty skymt0
[11:38] <LjL> WebGuest: and it's Dapper Drake anyway, not Drake Dapper
[11:38] <wastrel> nuts:  themes.org
[11:38] <WebGuest> what about C and A?
[11:38] <ITSa341> hmm, webmin seems a bit rougher and not as user friendly as cpanel, any other recommendations?
[11:38] <WebGuest> letters A and C were?
[11:38] <LjL> WebGuest: there aren't those.
[11:38] <cafuego> ITSa341: ssh
[11:38] <WebGuest> LjL: what do you mean?
[11:38] <skymt0> nuts: http://freshmeat.net/browse/56/
[11:39] <LjL> WebGuest: no Ubuntu version codename, as of now, starts with A or C.
[11:39] <cafuego> ITSa341: maybe even vnc tunneled over ssh; full gui :-)
[11:39] <neobyte420> i gave up on winbloz and moved almost all my systems to Ubuntu
[11:39] <shingalated> is there a way other than chroot to run 32bit apps on a 64 bit kernel??
[11:39] <skymt0> ITSa341: have you tried ehcp? it's making progress. it's hard to compete with cpanel, though
[11:39] <boozey> does cpanel work on ubuntu?
[11:39] <eobanb> ITSa341, webmin is about as polished as it comes when you're talking free software.
[11:39] <saxin> LjL: thanks for helping me out with this. nice of you :-)
[11:40] <neobyte420> I think i am really satisfied with the move
[11:40] <bimberi> WebGuest: the alphabetic thing started at Dapper
[11:40] <LjL> except it's unsupported by debian and ubuntu now
[11:40] <eobanb> cpanel generally only works well with rpm distros.
[11:40] <bimberi> Dralid: does is show up with 'sudo fdisk -l' ?
[11:40] <cafuego> and boxes that aren't internet-facing
[11:40] <neobyte420> I still want to push for more...ill look more into what else i can do
[11:40] <neobyte420> g2g peace
[11:40] <Gorlith> does anyone know about using video out?
[11:40] <boozey> what is a good control panel like cpane thats free for ubuntu?
[11:40] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Gorlith about tvout
[11:40] <ITSa341> skymt0  No I have looked at it but still rought for what I need. It needs to be beginner friendly and free is NOT a requirement, but then again $1000+ for cpanel is out of the question
[11:41] <we2by> guys, any recommendation for a C++ editor?
[11:41] <LjL> boozey, they've been talking about that in the last 10 minutes
[11:41] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell we2by about code
[11:41] <printk> we2by: vim
[11:41] <we2by> I like vim when working remotely
[11:41] <we2by> not when I work on my desktop machine
[11:41] <cafuego> Your best bet is to learn the tasks you need to do on the commandline, not installing a remote exploit to make life easier.
[11:41] <Dralid> bimberi: Yes, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31553/
[11:41] <cafuego> But that's just me.

[11:45] <pozdiy> does anybody know how can I decrease the resolution of the login screen on Edgy?
[11:45] <cafuego> ITSa341: Just the users/postfix modules then? or dns as well?
[11:45] <Keyseir> skymt0: Attempting to load it.
[11:46] <bimberi> Dralid: 'sudo mkdir /mnt/sdb1'  then  'sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1'  or add a line to /etc/fstab to have it mounted at every boot
[11:46] <Keyseir> skymt0: Before that I don't recall it having a problem
[11:46] <WebGuest1> It appears my router reset, I'm back now
[11:46] <cafuego> ITSa341: webmin should be fine, provided you give them a step by step guide on the most common tasks. (writing docs sucks, I know)
[11:47] <skymt0> Keyseir: try this in a terminal: "mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.bak && firefox". that will tell you if any of your settings are causing the crash.
[11:47] <WebGuest1> Codeblokcs is for n00bs
[11:47] <Keyseir> skymt0, nope, still crashed same way
[11:47] <skymt0> Keyseir: if you want your settings back (including any that cause crashes), do "mv ~/.mozilla.bak ~/.mozilla"
[11:48] <dcorbin> Got a co-worker trying out Kubuntu.  He's trying to set his primary display to 1600x1200, which he's used on Windows, and I've used on Gentoo the same way, but he can't get it to go past 1280x1024.  Ideas?
[11:48] <johnny__> hey all
[11:48] <ITSa341> cafuego   I don't think they will really need dns at this point but they also need to be able to add databases and cgi scripts etc  they run a vacation rental company and their reservation database is going to be browser based...and up where we are if you want to be able to access it dependably you have to host it yourself...centurytel dsl is all that is available here amd it is very undependable
[11:48] <eobanb> dcorbin, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:48] <johnny__> how can i delete files fromthe terminal?
[11:48] <WebGuest1> heh what happend to LjL
[11:48] <eobanb> rm, johnny__ .  use with care
[11:48] <cafuego> ITSa341: Hmmm.
[11:48] <skymt0> Keyseir: try reinstalling: "sudo aptitude reinstall firefox"
[11:49] <WebGuest1> maybe he got banned when he tried banning me
[11:49] <dcorbin> eobanb: OK.  I'll try that.  Also, somehow, he managed to get a large virtual desktop enabled, which he definately does not want.  Where would such a setting be?
[11:49] <WebGuest1> I am invulnerable
[11:49] <ITSa341> well, I got what I needed, more choices to look into and research...I guess I'll set up a couple different options on vm's and let them look

[11:50] <eobanb> dcorbin, just the gnome virtual desktops, you mean?
[11:50] <Dralid> bimberi thanks!
[11:50] <awesomepetter> now i don't have shutdown button
[11:50] <awesomepetter> or reset
[11:50] <bimberi> Dralid: yw :)
[11:50] <awesomepetter> neither in GDM or Gnome
[11:51] <awesomepetter> anyone knows what could be going on?
[11:51] <dcorbin> eobanb: No.  I mean panning window.  His resolution is 1280x1024, but his desktop is larger and so it pans all around.
[11:51] <eobanb> mm, i think i've had that problem once also, awesomepetter
[11:51] <eobanb> dcorbin, oh, strange.
[11:51] <eobanb> dcorbin, i thought that was basically a windows thing.
[11:51] <awesomepetter> dcorbin you need to add this to your xorg file: virtual 1024 768
[11:52] <awesomepetter> or any other resolution
[11:52] <eobanb> dcorbin, it's not the screen magnifier is it?

[11:52] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:52] <dcorbin> eobanb: I don't think so.  I've seen it do the same thing on other X machines.
[11:52] <eobanb> !tell enrique_ about chmod
[11:52] <dcorbin> awesomepetter: should the resolution always be the same as your actual resolutoin?
[11:53] <funkyHat> Does anyone else find it silly that apt regenerates the font cache after each and every font package is set up (why not just wait until the end??)
[11:53] <bimberi> enrique_: 'chmox +x file.bin'  then  './file.bin'
[11:53] <awesomepetter> dcorbin it should but somethimes it doesn't work
[11:53] <eilker_>  ftp://localhost is working but ftp://myip  is not working , could anyone help me ??  /vsftpd here
[11:53] <awesomepetter> dcorbin so for me it looks like this:
[11:53] <bimberi> enrique_: sorry, chmod not chmox
[11:53] <dcorbin> awesomepetter: great.
[11:53] <johnny__> i am testing rm in a test file
[11:53] <johnny__> johnny@johnny-desktop:~/Desktop$ rm new file
[11:53] <awesomepetter> dcorbin                 Modes           "1024x768_85" "800x600" "720x400" "640x480" "12$
[11:53] <awesomepetter>                 Virtual         1024 768
[11:53] <johnny__> rm: cannot remove `new': No such file or directory
[11:53] <johnny__> rm: cannot remove `file': No such file or directory
[11:53] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell johnny__ about pastebin
[11:53] <Languid> anyone know why my entire system freezes up when i open the bookmarks toolbar in firefox 2?
[11:53] <stefan> funkyHat: how should apt know it`s the last?
[11:53] <LjL> johnny__: spaces have to be escaped.
[11:54] <LjL> johnny__: either put the filename into quotes, or use "\ " to type an escaped space
[11:54] <johnny__> whats that mean?
[11:54] <enrique_> thanks man ;)
[11:54] <johnny__> k
[11:54] <funkyHat> stefan, why does it need to know it's the last? why not wait until it's finished installing all packages?
[11:54] <awesomepetter> eobanb do you know the answer for my problem?
[11:54] <dcorbin> awesomepetter: sad that you have to specify "virtual", when you don't want virtuality.
[11:55] <johnny__> k ty quotes worked
[11:55] <awesomepetter> dcorbin you got somethink like this: you have set the resolution to let's say 1024x768 but it acts (you have to scroll) like a higher one?
[11:55] <john83> this is pretty important
[11:55] <john83> how do I start a vnc listener remotely ??
[11:55] <itrebal> any links about setting up bzflag as a server? i've got the bzflag-server package
[11:55] <dcorbin> awesomepetter: yes.
[11:55] <john83> the desktop sharing thing in gnome is what I was using, but now I'm using xfce4
[11:56] <awesomepetter> dcorbin then you have to set the 'virtual' to the same resolution as you wish to use
[11:56] <] -[erbie> hi all
=== itrebal is now known as [itrebal] 
[11:56] <dcorbin> awesomepetter: like I said.   Said, because I don't want any virtual, it should just not do it.  But instead, I have to say "BE VIRTUAL AT FULL SIZE".
[11:56] <funkyHat> john83, ssh in with X forwarding enabled and launch remote desktop preferences...
[11:56] <Akuma_> i keep trying different keyboard shortcuts for set_terminal_title in gconf-editor, and none of them work... whats wrong with it/me ?

[11:57] <slimz> anyone know how to get a canon ip3000 up and running? i tried a forum trick to use another driver, but it didnt work
[11:57] <tomh-> it uses esmtp which times out after trying all dns entries
[11:57] <tomh-> apperently
[11:57] <awesomepetter> dcorbin as far as i know it's in virtual mode the whole time, but you just don't see it because it should set itself to the resolution you actually use
