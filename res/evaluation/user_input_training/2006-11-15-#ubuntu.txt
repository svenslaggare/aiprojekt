[12:07] <bunnythebunny> It just stays in "Setting up swiftfox" and then it ends.

[12:11] <MikeB-> abuyazan: ok
[12:11] <TGPO> abuyazan, ask away
[12:11] <ucordes> sidny4: ath_pci
[12:11] <roll> do you have any idea where is the php log file ?
[12:11] <bunnythebunny> lol i cant install opera cause ive got amd64
[12:11] <jvai> hey all, i found "a" solution for my usb storage mount problems, but i can't make it stik aftr the reboot, how do i make " rmmod ehci-hcd" sticky? the kernel seems to reload this when i reboot
[12:11] <abuyazan> first thing i have on my work printer kyocera
[12:11] <Stormx2> radioaktivstorm: Uninstall the current version first.
[12:11] <abuyazan> can i find the driver easy ?
[12:12] <sidny4> ucordes, I beleive that is with most other modules in /etc/modprobe.d/
[12:12] <mayckol> bunnythebunny: I late wath are your problems whit firefox?
[12:12] <TGPO> abuyazan, does it work with suse?
[12:12] <nuts7> crimsun: it worked, thanx =) nut i got a little other problem now.. my Workspace in the panel are much too narrow now :(
[12:12] <MikeB-> jvai: you can blacklist the module
[12:12] <sidny4> bunnythebunny, yeah, things haven't been made for the 64 processor yet
[12:12] <clemyeats> user-land: I'll put a forum in place, it's a good idea.. I suppose it depends if people like it and if there's a demand for it. But the basic thing is, at the moment, it is only a customization of Ubuntu, same packages, same issues... so I suppose people who run Linux mint, really should understand that they're running a Mint version of Ubuntu.
[12:12] <roll> looking for php log file
[12:12] <abuyazan> no it works fine TGPO
[12:12] <jvai> oo yea, mikeb but how?
[12:12] <abuyazan> but it is not working with debian
[12:13] <TGPO> abuyazan, if it works in suse then odds are better than average that it will work no problem in ubuntu
[12:13] <gesker> I've added dpt_i2o to the modprobe.d/blacklist file but on boot its still loaded? is there anything else I can/should try
[12:13] <user-land> clemyeats, lets create a torrent for it.
[12:13] <roll> ??
[12:13] <roll> ??
[12:13] <roll> ??
[12:13] <roll> php log file ?
[12:13] <Spee_Der> Well. Here goes nothing, wish me luck with this dual monitor thingy......  :|
[12:13] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2 what is the command to uninstall...Ive never had to use it before.
[12:13] <mayckol> abuyazan, you can probe the Live CD first
[12:13] <sidny4> good luck spee_der
[12:13] <Stormx2> radioaktivstorm: apt-get remove i think
[12:13] <Spee_Der> ty sid....
[12:14] <abuyazan> and i face problem in last few days , my system halts many time says in logs cannot turn on the cooling device
[12:14] <MikeB-> jvai: edit  /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common and  add echi-usb to the DISABLED_MODULES="" line
[12:14] <abuyazan> tempreture critical then shutdown
[12:14] <clemyeats> user-land: I've never done that before :) I'll look into and put a torrent on the mirror tomorrow. Thanks, that's a great idea.
[12:14] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2, It wont even let me do that....it starts then it returns that same message: E: The package skype needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it
[12:14] <abuyazan> i think it is something related to kernel in suse
[12:14] <TGPO> abuyazan, that may well be a hardware issue, open the case and see if the fans are working and are they clean?
[12:15] <Stormx2> hmm
[12:15] <user-land> does somebody here know a good tracker for linux torrents ?
[12:15] <geokok> Can anyone suggest an exif data editor other than exiv2???
[12:15] <jvai> mikeb -"sudo gedit /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common"?
[12:15] <abuyazan> i sent my laptop to provider and they clean the fan and said it is ok TGPO
[12:15] <clemyeats> user-land: http://linuxtracker.org/
[12:15] <abuyazan> but it come back again
[12:16] <user-land> ah, ok :-)
[12:16] <Stormx2> radioaktivstorm: Do a apt-get update then a apt-get clean
[12:16] <philo> how well does wireless work in edgy? what do I need to do if the appropriate kernel module for my wifi card is already loaded, to choose the network to connect to?
[12:16] <itrebal> how can i open a root terminal in an ubuntu live-cd?
[12:16] <philo> itrebal: sudo su
[12:17] <TGPO> abuyazan, then it may well be a driver/kernel issue with suse. fire up the ubuntu live CD and run normally for awhile. See if you start getting temp problems
[12:17] <erUSUL> itrebal: open a normal terminal and type 'sudo -i'
[12:17] <snessiram> I'm currently running xubuntu but I have some problems with packages when installing not-apt-get programs and I'm currently thinking maybe debian would be better in that case... what do you guys think?
[12:17] <CharlieSu> most of you guys install with the alternate CD?
[12:17] <ompaul> philo, that is the worst advice I have seen in a long time sudo -i
[12:17] <itrebal> thanks
[12:17] <clemyeats> itrebal: applications --> accessories --> Terminal
[12:17] <ompaul> itrebal, sudo -i
[12:17] <sidny4> I install with the alternate cd
[12:17] <ompaul> :)
[12:17] <philo> ompaul why?
[12:17] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2: ok, now try the remove and install?
[12:17] <abuyazan> TGPO: i will check it
[12:17] <TGPO> abuyazan, the nice thing about ubuntu is the live CD, it lets you run the OS without having to install it first
[12:17] <itrebal> ompaul: not to worry, every time i get ubuntu insltalled the 1st thing i do is sudo passwd
[12:18] <clemyeats> itrebal: oh sorry.. I misread.. "sudo su -"
[12:18] <jvai> ty mikeB i had to dave the whole chat session to refer to later :)
[12:18] <abuyazan> but as i see in the internet ubuntu is more populer , right TGPO
[12:18] <TGPO> abuyazan, just remember since it is running from CD that its slow slow
[12:18] <ompaul> philo, the way it is done here is !root and let people see how they can do it themselves, and learn to live with sudo, which is a good thing
[12:18] <Lahey> what kernal does Ubuntu run?
[12:18] <crimsun> Linux.
[12:18] <ompaul> !linux-image
[12:18] <clemyeats> 2.6.17 I think
[12:18] <pjay_> LOL

[12:19] <TGPO> 2.6.17-10
[12:19] <crimsun> the bot is spinning.
[12:19] <snessiram> Anyone an opinion? ubuntu >< debian
[12:19] <abuyazan> TGPO: i am downlaoding it now
[12:19] <ompaul> philo, so on that page it says sudo -i
[12:19] <crimsun> snessiram: offtopic.
[12:19] <clemyeats> snessiram: both great.. depends on your needs.
[12:19] <TGPO> snessiram, 64 bit?
[12:19] <Lahey> TGPO, is that for Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS
[12:19] <cfedde> snessiram: I pick ubunutu server over debian these days.
[12:19] <snessiram> crimsun: where do you suggest me to go else? :S
[12:19] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2: and we get a step closer to the problem: dpkg: error processing skype (--remove): Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should reinstall it before attempting a removal.
[12:19] <clemyeats> Lahey: no that's for edgy.
[12:20] <snessiram> and I'm talking about on my laptop

[12:20] <TGPO> snessiram, ubuntu sets up frew scaling debian you have to set it up

[12:25] <Discerer> it's so heavy

[12:26] <snessiram> problem was I needed to upgrade python, but I can't without deinstalling the alreaddy installed version, and when deinstalling it it would just remove a lot of software
[12:26] <] -[erbie> TGPO: but it seems not everything is OK. e.g. Evolution won't connect to my POP server
[12:26] <cfedde> snessiram: if you find .deb that don't have some of the dependencies, my usual mode of operation is to start hunting for clues by googling for the errormessages I'm getting.

[12:34] <tylerl> When I install a theme, and change "Controls" under theme details, it looks really blocky and ugly, nothing like it should.  What am I doing wrong?
[12:34] <elbonzi> blackhat, i have edgy installed and my intel 3945ABG wireless card doesnt work

[12:34] <TGPO> !repeat tylerl
[12:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about repeat tylerl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:34] <nuts7> crimsun: in xfce4-session or in autostart folder?
[12:35] <snessiram> cfedde: I'm using (normally :P) the repositories of ubuntuguide.org
[12:35] <TGPO> !repeat
[12:35] <ubotu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[12:35] <elbonzi> I tried ndiswrapper, i compiled it myself, taht didnt work
[12:35] <blackhat> you have a dell laptop?
[12:35] <elbonzi> yes
[12:35] <tylerl> TGPO: Do you know much about themes?
[12:35] <crimsun> nuts7: check both.
=== ChrisJ is now known as Chris_J
[12:35] <TGPO> tylerl, from the amountof responses you have goten in your request for help, no one knows enough to help you
[12:36] <blackhat> there is a tutorial on www.linux-laptop.net/
[12:36] <tylerl> I'm sure most people here install themes, so I would find it odd that nobody had any idea how to help.
[12:37] <elbonzi> blackhat, thanks il lcheck itout
[12:37] <nuts7> crimsun: cant find anything about it :
[12:39] <blackhat> elbonzi: but I think your card should be recognised automaticly
[12:39] <elbonzi> blackhat, i thought so too!! it worked on 6.06
[12:39] <TGPO> nuts7 have you asked in #xubuntu?
[12:39] <elbonzi> when i reinstalled 6.10 it didnt appear - it's correctly identified in device manager in gnome tho
[12:39] <snessiram> cfedde: You're not going to believe this, I uncommented original sources again....and scribus just is in apt-get... just installed... just spent 4 hours on that...
[12:40] <cfedde> snessiram: YOU WIN!
[12:40] <cfedde> :-)
[12:40] <cfedde> Yay!
[12:40] <blackhat> elbonzi: does iwlist list your card?
[12:40] <elbonzi> blackhat, maybe it woudl have before - i've messed with it quite a bit so i think i broke it even more
[12:40] <snessiram> cfedde: or not :'(
[12:41] <snessiram> it's scribEs, not scribUs, damn :P
[12:41] <elbonzi> blackhat, when i installed the windows driver with ndiswrapper the card worked but when i modprobe ndiswrapper'd it the computer locked up after a few minutes
[12:41] <snessiram> scribes is now in apt-get also "but never uploaded"
[12:41] <elbonzi> which i assume is the kernel crashing?
[12:41] <blackhat> elbonzi yes i had that as well
[12:41] <elbonzi> oh god! i'm not alone!
[12:42] <The_Mu> Having some trouble with Ubuntu... can anyone help?
[12:42] <prashant> how stop and start a service eg apache on ubuntu
[12:42] <blackhat> try a diffrent version of ndiswrapper
[12:42] <elbonzi> should i compile it myself again?
[12:42] <clemyeats> The_Mu: just ask
[12:42] <The_Mu> Halright then.
[12:42] <The_Mu> Here's my problem.
[12:42] <blackhat> yes that worked out for me
[12:42] <elbonzi> and youre on edgy? can you recall what version you used? ill try that now
[12:42] <The_Mu> I'm using the latest version of Ubuntu. Downloaded it like last week.
[12:43] <The_Mu> Start it up.
[12:43] <The_Mu> Press "Enter" to go into Live CD/Installation mode.
[12:43] <The_Mu> It gives me the loading screen for a while.
[12:43] <The_Mu> Then the screen goes completely black.
[12:44] <clemyeats> The_Mu: did you check the MD5 sums before burning the ISO to CD ?
[12:44] <snessiram> argh whatever, going to look for that tomorrow or so, thanks for helping me out cfedde
[12:44] <snessiram> (trying to at least :))
[12:44] <The_Mu> >_>
[12:44] <The_Mu> I should have done that.
[12:44] <The_Mu> How do I check it?
[12:44] <blackhat> elbonzi I had problems with 1.22 but any newer one worked for me
[12:44] <clemyeats> The_Mu: md5sum myfile.iso (in a terminal)
[12:45] <blackhat> elbonzi try the newest
[12:45] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2 im looking at fstab and it looks like there is an hda2 and an hda5 in the file.
[12:45] <elbonzi> blackhat i did
[12:45] <elbonzi> which is whats confusing
[12:45] <The_Mu> Yeah, um, is there an md5 tool for DOS?
[12:45] <clemyeats> The_Mu: yes, but no repository... so you need google to find one :)
[12:46] <The_Mu> Thanks...
[12:46] <clemyeats> The_Mu: alternatively, boot on the CD and select CHECK MEDIA (or something like that) to check the integrity of the CD.
[12:46] <TGPO> offtopic #debian.dk "Ubuntu is an ancient african word meaning 'I cant configure Debian'"
[12:46] <elbonzi> blackhat, i used version 1.28
[12:46] <The_Mu> Oh wait.
[12:46] <The_Mu> I did check the integrity.
[12:46] <The_Mu> It found no errors.
[12:46] <blackhat> elbonzi try a new compile i heard from others that it worked after it even if that sounds like the win method
[12:46] <jvai> ooooo! tgpo.. not fair!
[12:46] <rogue780> !php
[12:46] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[12:47] <clemyeats> The_Mu: ok, then it's either a problem with your graphic card config... or you power management....
[12:47] <blackhat> elbonzi or use a diffrent (older) version
[12:47] <TGPO> jvai I saw it in the channel list and started laughing, figured I'd share the humor
[12:47] <The_Mu> I'm using... lessee...
[12:47] <jvai> <-- admits he cant figure out debian.. but admires it
[12:47] <clemyeats> The_Mu: did you try the "safe graphic mode" or something like that ? :)
[12:47] <elbonzi> blackhat, alright then - do you happen to know the link for directions concerning compiling it? I followed that guide online before
[12:47] <The_Mu> nVidia GeForce 4.
[12:47] <prashant> blackhat how stop a service apache on ubuntu
[12:47] <The_Mu> And yes, I did try safe graphical mode, and it didn't work.
[12:48] <The_Mu> I also tried "boot: live"...
[12:48] <The_Mu> which wasn't much of an improvement; it displayed an underscore until I forcefully shut the computer down.
[12:48] <clemyeats> The_Mu: ok, you need to disable ACPI then... basically you append some keywords at boot... you need to ask people around here (I'm not sure exactly what the boot keywords are)
[12:49] <The_Mu> hmm...
[12:50] <jvai> mumbles, when grub boot loader is on clik "esc" edit the boot line & add "acpi=off" bfore ro
[12:51] <The_Mu> Thx.
[12:51] <TGPO> jvai isnt that noacpi ?
[12:52] <The_Mu> oy vey
[12:52] <Konnektion> its either acpi=off or acpi=no
[12:52] <jvai> well, i'm goin off what i did in hoary, it may be that in dapper/edgy tgpo
[12:52] <jvai> i dont have to do that in dapper
[12:52] <TGPO> jvai bah its one of em :)
[12:52] <jvai> lol
[12:53] <The_Mu> This /will/ work on the Live CD, correct?
[12:53] <blackhat> elbonzi sorry I used the german instructions
[12:53] <Konnektion> no ones perfect :-P
[12:53] <elbonzi> blackhat, haha no proble
[12:53] <The_Mu> And what exactly do you mean when you refer to "ro"?
[12:53] <elbonzi> thanks for the help
[12:53] <jvai> i dont kno mu, grub loads on the live cd?
[12:53] <BlackHawk> gn8
[12:53] <tuxub> hi, my ubuntu edgy is getting 100% wait time on the command top once in a while and it stops responding. the load value shoots up to 15
[12:54] <tuxub> how can I find which process is making this happening?
[12:54] <blackhat> elbonzi ja dann http://wiki.ubuntuusers.org/WLAN/NdisWrapper
[12:54] <tuxub> and what does the wait value means?
[12:54] <SUDO_Tux> hello
[12:54] <blackhat> h http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/WLAN/NdisWrapper
[12:54] <SUDO_Tux> does anyone here know if microsoft flight simulator works with Wine or something?
[12:54] <SUDO_Tux> MS2004
[12:54] <SUDO_Tux> I own the disk
[12:55] <The_Mu> I got Flight Simulator '98 to run in Wine once... >_>
[12:55] <SUDO_Tux> ok
[12:55] <TGPO> SUDO_Tux, didnt I point you at www.winehq.com the other day to look for your "will this windows app work" questions
[12:55] <MetaBookfoziS> bye all
[12:55] <SUDO_Tux> lol
[12:55] <Stormx2> radioaktivstorm: If I were you, go get the GParted Live CD, that can help a lot...
[12:55] <The_Mu> Or, more accurately, http://appdb.winehq.org
[12:56] <MarcN> tuxub: waiting for io? (according to man top)
[12:56] <Terminus> SUDO_Tux: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=2819 <-- this says it doesn't work.
[12:56] <SUDO_Tux> Terminus: thanks
[12:56] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2: alright, Ill do that, thanks for all of your help (i have to take off)
[12:56] <The_Mu> Added "acpi=off" to Boot Options, and it still doesn't work.
[12:56] <hacosta> hi, using edgy, when i startup ubuntu instead of a loading screen i see a screen with circles and squares, prety colorful
[12:56] <hacosta> as if it had no themes or something
[12:57] <Lahey> can i add a program to synaptic program manager?
[12:57] <TGPO> The_Mu try noacpi
[12:57] <TGPO> Lahey yes
[12:57] <Lahey> ow?
[12:57] <Lahey> how?
[12:57] <TGPO> lahey oh add to not add with ... no
[12:57] <jvai> hey does edgy have the same start-up/shutdown sounds? i luv it
[12:57] <Stormx2> radioaktivstorm: Okay.
[12:58] <Stormx2> radioaktivstorm: Good Luck.
[12:58] <The_Mu> Trying "noacpi".
[12:58] <MoxJet> What boot partition does ubuntu use? What is /proc?
[12:59] <The_Mu> Now it's displaying some text on the screen and changing the font like normal...
[12:59] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2 thanks! ttul :)
[12:59] <TGPO> MoxJet, which ever one you install it to, and processes
[12:59] <tuxub> MarcN, IO ? hard disk?
[12:59] <TGPO> The_Mu yeah!
[12:59] <Lahey> is there a default nntp news reader
[12:59] <FantasticFoo> pretty safe to upgrade to edgy now?
[12:59] <The_Mu> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand... it's still not working.
[12:59] <The_Mu> TGPO: It does that /every/ time... ;>_>
[01:00] <Lahey> oh nevermind
[01:00] <The_Mu> It gets up to fsck and then goes blank.
[01:00] <MarcN> tuxub: IO is typically disk access, but also procs waiting on input from other devices (nic, keyboard, etc)
[01:00] <MoxJet> I don't seem to have one in /etc/fstab and my sda1 is used for /
[01:00] <elriah> Hi all.  What's the package that installs sound support in 6.06?
[01:00] <FantasticFoo> oops
[01:00] <FantasticFoo> sorry
[01:00] <MarcN> FantasticFoo: edgy is fine.
[01:00] <jvai> it's dell, & it's exotic hardware
[01:00] <FantasticFoo> MarcN: oh, ok.
[01:00] <FantasticFoo> cool
[01:00] <TGPO> The_Mu have you let it ride out for awhile?
[01:00] <tuxub> MarcN, and can that put my all OS on its knees?
[01:01] <The_Mu> TGPO: Yes...
[01:01] <Stormx2> elriah: Sound support should be installed by default
[01:01] <MarcN> tuxub: waiting for io is not using the cpu.   What process is using the most cpu?  Are you swapping?
[01:01] <Stormx2> elriah: Do you mean specific codecs?
[01:01] <TGPO> The_Mu what are you installing it on?
[01:01] <The_Mu> The CD loading sounds just stopped.
[01:01] <The_Mu> Dell Dimension... L933r?
[01:02] <jvai> dapper "should" work on that mu
[01:02] <tuxub> MarcN, that could be it
[01:03] <tuxub> since i upgraded my edgy box from dapper the swap space stopped working
[01:03] <elriah> Stormx2: I started with 6.06 server and worked my way up :) Is it alsa-base?
[01:03] <Manderson> Anyone know why firefox and thunderbird load SOOOO slow on my computer??
[01:03] <MarcN> tuxub: you really want to avoid swapping -- kills performance.
[01:03] <The_Mu> jvai: So I'll have to download Dapper?
[01:03] <tuxub> I get a swap signature error on loading the OS
[01:03] <MarcN> Manderson: not enough memory?
[01:03] <jvai> wait, mu, you're using edgy now?
[01:04] <The_Mu> Yesh.
[01:04] <variant> tuxub: probably best to remake the swap, what parition is your swap partition?
[01:04] <tuxub> if i Make manually mkswap /dev/hda2 && swapon /dev/hda2 it works
[01:04] <jvai> ooo
[01:04] <blackhat> manderson No idea
[01:04] <tuxub> but on reboot the error appears again
[01:04] <Manderson> MarcN - No, I've got a 1 GB ram
[01:04] <MarcN> tuxub: nonsense.  Check /etc/fstab and look for the swap partition
[01:04] <tuxub> before edgy this wasnt happening
[01:04] <variant> tuxub: odd, what does the line in /etc/fstab say for the swap parition?
[01:04] <jvai> edgy is.. well, edgy
[01:04] <Manderson> I upgraded to FF2, that's when both of them went to crap it seems.
[01:04] <Lahey> Is Ubuntu the most widly used personal linux OS
[01:05] <jvai> no lahey, gentoo is.. lol
[01:05] <Lahey> really?
[01:05] <variant> Lahey: those kind of statistics are almost impossible to produce accurately, i think ubuntu is very widely used though just from what i have seen
[01:05] <blackhat> lahey look at distrowatch
[01:05] <tuxub> UUID=5c49a355-caf9-480a-9306-2994c3391805       none swap sw 0 0
[01:05] <Stormx2> elriah: yeah, think so.
[01:05] <variant> Lahey: distrowatch etc really are not accurate mesures
[01:05] <elriah> lol, sound was installed, just had the speakers off.. heh
[01:05] <MarcN> Manderson: do you have a bunch of plugins/extensions?  Could be they are checking for updates?  Is DNS working right?
[01:05] <Manderson> It's driving me crazy...on average, it takes about 20 seconds to load thunderbird and 16 seconds to load FF2
[01:06] <jvai> ubuntu is by far .. the easiet, debian is everywher on the backends
[01:06] <Lahey> i dint think so
[01:06] <elriah> I just never assume things will work,Ubuntu has impressed me from this standpoint...
[01:06] <clemyeats> Lahey: I'd say it is.. by far. Both distrowatch and google show clear indications of that.
[01:06] <Manderson> MarcN - I don't really have that many plugins...in fact, when I upgraded, I didn't have any plugins...
[01:06] <The_Mu> jvai: So what now?
[01:06] <Lahey> it says Suse here
[01:06] <sonyoandr> anybody know how to make money online with google?
[01:06] <MarcN> Manderson: about 7seconds for me (1G ram, Pentium M 1.6Ghz)
[01:06] <variant> Manderson: open it from a terminal and see if there are a bunch of warnins on startup
[01:07] <jvai> i got hooked on ubuntu since hoary, i got the cd in a mag
[01:07] <clemyeats> Lahey: you can use google trends to see what people search for the most.
[01:07] <jvai> was dat? Mu
[01:07] <sonyoandr> yeah... but like that 120,000 kid...
[01:07] <sonyoandr> how to make that much...
[01:07] <The_Mu> What now?
[01:07] <sonyoandr> you wavent heard??
[01:07] <sonyoandr> haven't
[01:07] <pdesai> hey
[01:07] <variant> tuxub: type free -m, that will tell you how much ram and swap you have in megabytes. does it list swap space?
[01:08] <MarcN> Manderson: variant makes a good suggetion
[01:08] <Manderson> variant - there are a bunch of warnsing about theme engine in module_path: "pixmap"
[01:08] <variant> Manderson: anything else? are you using the default theme?
[01:08] <tuxub> variant, now it does but I enabled the swap space mannualy just before now
[01:08] <jvai> mumbles, the cd wont boot on the dell, & it's edgy.... try dapper.. it's got long term support & more stable
[01:08] <Manderson> and another bunch that refer to plugin_get_value 1 and 2
[01:08] <sonyoandr> I read a story about people that make thousands a dollar a day on google, and this kid that made 120,000 at http://milliondollarscience.com/1way2googlemoney/  ... that's what I mean
[01:09] <sonyoandr> anyone know their secret?
[01:09] <sonyoandr> it's supposed to be "common sense!
[01:09] <sonyoandr> not to me anyhow
[01:09] <blackhat> can somone ban this chatbot
[01:09] <lullabud> seriously.
[01:09] <xipietotec> hey....how do I change my color depth?
[01:10] <variant> Manderson: a good way to fix most problems with firefox is to backup your .mozilla directory (cp ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.backup
[01:10] <lullabud> xipietotec:  there's a screen system preference that will let you do that.
[01:10] <jvai> that's the best i can tell u Mu, i dont kno the full specs of your dell
[01:10] <variant> Manderson: then deleet the .mozilla dir and start firefox (you can use mv instead of cp tbh)
[01:10] <xipietotec> lullabud: hrrmmm...I looked and I only had resolution and refresh rate options, lemme check again
[01:10] <Manderson> variant - That's one thing I haven't done since upgrading to FF2...I'll try that. Thanks.
[01:11] <jvai> it may be hardware related
[01:11] <variant> mumbles: what error do you get when booting the cd?
[01:11] <variant> tuxub: ok, try rebooting again and tell me if the swap is detected at all by ubuntu
[01:11] <sonyoandr> talked to this kid here yesterday... he sendt me a check on $600 just to prove that this was nothing but pocket money and that he was "filthy rich"
[01:12] <variant> blackhat: /ignore sonyoandr
[01:12] <lullabud> too bad /kick wasn't a vote type of action.
[01:12] <tuxub> ok, now I can't do that cause i am transfering some stuff that can't be stopped right now
[01:12] <MarcN> ah, just ignored sonyoandr (in gaim, right click on the nick and select ignore)
[01:12] <sonyoandr> don't blackhat me...
[01:12] <siXy> pity this is such an op-less channel really :/
[01:12] <xipietotec> yeah....I've got nothing for adjusting the color palette depth in preferences
[01:13] <tuxub> ill let you know as sson as i can
[01:13] <variant> tuxub: np, let me know when you did it
[01:13] <The_Mu> [INFO] 	You are now ignoring sonyoandr.
[01:13] <The_Mu> Ignorimation.
[01:13] <sonyoandr> hmm
[01:13] <clemyeats> xipietotec: in gnome ??
[01:13] <xipietotec> yes
[01:13] <tuxub> anyway, ill stick around here... if it doesnt happen again it must be related with the swap space thing
[01:13] <sonyoandr> http://getrichblog.blogspot.com/2006/09/get-rich-blog.html
[01:13] <clemyeats> xipietotec: you need to edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:13] <sonyoandr> I have tried various ways to make money online for years.
[01:13] <sonyoandr> Just recetly I discovered a way to make hundreds of dollars online on a daily basis.
[01:13] <sonyoandr> UPDATE 2nd :
[01:13] <sonyoandr> Last week earnings was CRAZY!!! I now have about 150 web sites that generate about $10 daily ? in other words I earn about $1,500 EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!
[01:13] <sonyoandr> Why You Should Be Impressed By This?
[01:13] <clemyeats> xipietotec: at the bottom somewhere it lists the "modes".. and the default one...
[01:13] <variant> siXy: there are ops when needed, type exclamation mark then ops to have them highlighted. only do this in a situation with a flood bot or some other serious issue though
[01:14] <sonyoandr> Who else wants to make $1,500 everey single day with Google?
[01:14] <sonyoandr> See how I did it - go to http://milliondollarscience.com/1way2googlemoney/
[01:14] <mcphail> !ops
[01:14] <ubotu> Help! Keybuk, mdz, Amaranth, tritium, ajmitch, crimsun, ogra, CarlK, Seveas, Burgundavia, apokryphos, thoreauputic, nalioth, Madpilot, ompaul, rob, Hobbsee, imbrandon, DBO, LjL, elkbuntu, Mez or gnomefreak!
[01:14] <xipietotec> ....you mean in order to change my color palette in gnome, I have to edit the x11.conf, and then reload the session....
[01:14] <tuxub> another thing is the usplash on edgy that only appears on shutdown and not on boot
[01:14] <variant> mcphail: doing that when not really required could get you kicked your self
[01:14] <xipietotec> that's bs.
[01:14] <variant> tuxub: works here
[01:14] <clemyeats> xipietotec: yes, save the file and restart xorg.
[01:14] <tuxub> it gives me the error: "no bootsplash for 1024x768"
[01:15] <mcphail> variant: in what way "not required"?
[01:15] <tuxub> but on shutdown it works ok
[01:15] <variant> tuxub: try reinstalling it
[01:15] <magicfab> question about panels in Gnome: how can I change the font colors ? I am using a dark background and text in menu options and applets is hard to read.
[01:15] <variant> mcphail: why do you need the ops?
[01:15] <sidny4> can you resize a partition using fdisk?
[01:15] <mcphail> variant: to keep the channel on-topic and spam free. We can continue the debate in offtopic if you desire.
[01:15] <blackhat> sindny4 i dont think so
[01:15] <blackhat> but why
[01:16] <clemyeats> xipietotec: there might be a way to change it on the fly.. but if there is I don't know about it.
[01:16] <variant> sidny4: yes, but it is advisable to use parted instead
[01:16] <elbonzi> How do I get Edgy to recognize my wireless hardware?
[01:16] <blackhat> elbonzi still not working?

[01:17] <variant> elbonzi: if you plug it in and it's not recognised automatically then you may have to use ndiswrapper to load the windows driver. if that doesnt work then you may be out of luck
[01:17] <elbonzi> blackhat, hehe, yeah i just reinstalled ndiswrapper (older version)
[01:17] <variant> elbonzi: ndiswrapper works for most chipsets that are not directly supported by ubuntu though
[01:17] <elbonzi> variant, i have a card that is supported it jsut doesnt work with edgy for some reason
[01:17] <siXy> very few modern ncards that dont work with either madwifi or ndiswrapper
[01:18] <blackhat> elbonzi did youu check if the module for your card is loaded
[01:18] <variant> elbonzi: have you checked to see if the module is loaded?

[01:18] <ameyer> I'm pretty sure ndiswrapper could be used even if the chipset is supported
[01:18] <elbonzi> HAHA
[01:18] <ameyer> IIRC some acer laptops need ndiswrapper even though they're "supported"

[01:18] <elbonzi> no i didnt - how do i check that
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[01:19] <blackhat> elbonzi because it blocked my card when i was trying to use ndiswrapper

[01:19] <xenium> my kdesvn is doing some problem on first right clicks .. most times showing a Kde information window Couldn't connect DCOP Won't receive any status notifications! ... sometimes crashing konqueror thou .. why is such an important package like kdesvn served in an sooo old version 0.8.5-1 ... current version is 0.11.0 .. no good integrated svn for gnome either
[01:19] <blackhat> elbonzi lsmod
[01:20] <blackhat> elbonzi and look for your card driver
[01:20] <elbonzi> blackhat okay
[01:20] <elbonzi> variant how do i know what the name of my module is?
[01:21] <variant> elbonzi: what card is it?
[01:21] <elbonzi> variant, intel 3945ABG
[01:22] <blackhat> elbonzi it should be something like ntel Pro WLAN 3945
[01:22] <blackhat> elbonzi it should be something like ipw3945

[01:22] <neighborlee> anyone here have 64 bit os plugins ( or 32 bit swiftfox with 32 plugins ) working toplay : http://www.gamespot.com < click on video for guitar hero II please...I can't get it to play in either 32 switffox OR 64bit firefox and wonder what im missing here.....
[01:22] <variant> elbonzi: lsmod | grep ipw3945
[01:22] <sizzam> like i kicked off this process to convert a dvd on my hard drive into an ISO:  mkisofs -dvd-video -udf -o dvd.iso /directory/
[01:22] <__mikem> sizzam, it sounds like a memory leak
[01:22] <sizzam> and while that was running, it would take about 20 seconds for a gnome-terminal to start after i clicked the launcher
[01:22] <variant> elbonzi: if its not htere then try modprobe ipw3945
[01:23] <blackhat> elbonzi it could block ndiswrapper from working

[01:23] <sizzam> __mikem: are you thinking a software problem, or a hardware problem with my ram
[01:23] <__mikem> memory leaks are software problems
[01:23] <sizzam> k
[01:23] <elbonzi> variant - when i do ndiswrapper -l it says the driver is installed but doesnt say "hardware installed"
[01:23] <__mikem> the program probably has stuff on the heap, when you kill it suddenly, it doesn't get a chance to clean up after itself
[01:23] <sizzam> __mikem: should i be able to track down the problematic program via 'top' or something?
[01:23] <__mikem> I believe so
[01:24] <blackhat> elbonzi is ipw3945 loaded, if so unload it using sudo rmmod ipw3945
[01:24] <variant> elbonzi: sorry, i am not experienced with ndiswrapper
[01:24] <variant> elbonzi: stick with blackhat :)
[01:24] <sizzam> __mikem: could it be related to running 32bit distro on my 64bit processor?

[01:26] <SpAc> i keep getting my lcd telling me that it is running a 'non-preset' mode
[01:26] <SpAc> I'm guessing it is something to do with the refresh rate?
[01:26] <elbonzi> blackhat, brb while i try this out
[01:27] <SpAc> I was hoping that xserver would auto detect the monitor, but it didn't. It is a Benq FP71E
[01:27] <blackhat> elbonzi wait
[01:27] <lullabud> spac:  x11 is kinda funky.  it does poor detection of a lot of hardware.
[01:28] <eaglehawk> I have proble with ktorrent DHT..any ideas anybody??
[01:28] <SpAc> lullabud: yeah... i'm downloading the manual so i can get the propper refresh rates from that. Will that help fix the problem?
[01:28] <elbonzi> blackhat yes?
[01:28] <SpAc> XChat question... how can i quickly and easily prefix my message with the persons username I want to talk to? Manually type it in?
[01:29] <lullabud> spac: you might try gtf
[01:29] <lullabud> spac: that is `gtf`, i think.
[01:29] <blackhat> elbonzi if ipw3945 is loaded unload it and ndiswrapper then load ndiswrapper again
[01:29] <elbonzi> blackhat okay
[01:29] <blackhat> elbonzi use sudo rmmod to unload the modules
[01:29] <lullabud> spac:  and honestly, you're probably better off googling around for other people's xorg.conf postings.  somebody is bound to have gotten that thing running correctly.
[01:29] <SpAc> lullabud: ok... got the manual... says:
[01:29] <lullabud> spac:  sometimes it's worth booting into another livecd, like knoppix, and copying the conf files from there.

[01:34] <magicfab> jamesp, check Restricted Formats in the wiki
[01:34] <blackmamba> hey, when i try to log out of ubuntu, to switch users or change window managers, the screen goes black and my mouse cursor freezes. i'm using the proprietary ati drivers (fglrx) and i've got an ati radeon x700. this happens in both gnome and kde.
[01:34] <user-land> spac: type the first few letters, then tab (repeatedly).
[01:34] <blackhat> jamesp install the mp3 packages
[01:34] <sidewalk`> but its not working and i cant compile ndiswrapper (newer verson)
[01:34] <magicfab> can someone remind me how to invoke/use ubotu ?
[01:34] <sidewalk`> anyone have any tips?
[01:34] <Saulren> How do I reset my ports in Ubuntu?  I can't open any of my ports, and I see no option to shutdown Ubuntu so I can restart it.
[01:35] <dryden> VQVNostalgia
[01:35] <frying_fish> Saulren: no option to shutdown?
[01:35] <blackhat> sidewalk which card
[01:35] <tarsier> When I updated to edgy my synaptic package manager icon in the system menu dissapeared.. how do I get it back?
[01:35] <frying_fish> surely you can (as root) do shutdown -h now in a terminal, that will shut down.
[01:35] <sidewalk`> blackhat: how do i check what card i have?
[01:35] <Saulren> frying_fish no, only change user, logout, lock screen and hibernate.
[01:35] <soundray> blackmamba: I had that in dapper. It got better when I upgraded to edgy.
[01:35] <keithhhhh> soundray: odd though Im trying to get to ./.bittorrent  .... but it doesnt even show on my system
[01:35] <Saulren> frying_fish, i will try that
[01:35] <SpAc> user-land, thanks :)
[01:35] <frying_fish> Saulren: seems your user doesn't have permisson....
[01:35] <blackmamba> soundray: i'm in edgy now
[01:35] <blackhat> sidewalk sorry you should know
[01:36] <lullabud> !ubotu
[01:36] <sidewalk`> blackhat: i know, its default in my acer aspire 502x
[01:36] <keithhhhh> soundray: do I have to login as super user?
[01:36] <lullabud> hrm...
[01:36] <sidewalk`> blackhat: an iwconfig says Broadcom 4318
[01:36] <frying_fish> keithhhhh: I think you mean ~/.bittorent
[01:36] <frying_fish> and that is ~ = your user's home dir.
[01:36] <blackhat> sidewalk so it is recogniced
[01:36] <user-land> spac, you were on usenet too ?
[01:36] <fishsticks> whenever i run a .sh file, it ends in a syntax error
[01:36] <fishsticks> why
[01:37] <soundray> keithhhhh: filenames and directory names starting with a . are usually invisible. Use ls -a to see them
[01:37] <keithhhhh> frying_fish: ok Ill try but Im not looking at ~
[01:37] <sidewalk`> blackhat: it recognized it by default
[01:37] <lullabud> fishsticks:  *any* .sh file?
[01:37] <sidewalk`> blackhat: im trying to install something called acpi_acer something
[01:37] <fishsticks> the last 2 i tried =P
[01:37] <frying_fish> and true, .something is a "Hidden" file so would need ls -a to find.
[01:37] <sidewalk`> and the ndiswrapper
[01:37] <lullabud> fishsticks:  what were they and what was the specific error?
[01:37] <fishsticks> let me find another script.
[01:37] <keithhhhh> soundray: oh freak have to deal with hidden folders in linux too crap  thanks  ;)
[01:37] <sidewalk`> but i have an old version of ndiswrapper, and i cant add "enable: 1" into /proc/acpi/acer/wireless
[01:37] <fishsticks> 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[01:38] <lullabud> fishsticks:  all of the files in /etc/init.d are .sh files, you might try running them.
[01:38] <phibar> test
[01:38] <keithhhhh> soundray: ya found it
[01:38] <mcphail> fishsticks: probably the bash/dash thing
[01:38] <soundray> blackmamba: what really solved my graphics problems was installing a PCIe nvidia card.
[01:38] <TGPO> fishsticks, how are you running them?
[01:38] <sidewalk`> and i cant compile a newer version of ndiswrapper
[01:38] <keithhhhh> soundray: much thanks :)
[01:38] <lullabud> mcphail:  oh man, you're probably right
[01:38] <lullabud> mcphail:  that is sooooo irritating.
[01:38] <fishsticks> sh foo.sh
[01:38] <keithhhhh> soundray: its been years since I touched linux
[01:38] <blackmamba> soundray: oh. that really sucks, i'm broke
[01:38] <blackhat> sidewalk ok if you want to use ndiswrapper you need to unload the brodcom driver and load ndiswrapper
[01:38] <mcphail> fishsticks: try bash foo.sh
[01:38] <lullabud> fishsticks:  try `bash foo.sh`
[01:38] <fishsticks> thanks
[01:38] <lullabud> LOL
[01:38] <mcphail> :)
[01:38] <blackhat> sidewalk why cant you
[01:39] <lullabud> mcphail:  i found that problem after debugging a kernel module compile failure for 2 days. =/
[01:39] <soundray> blackmamba: radeon driver won't work either?
[01:39] <mcphail> lullabud: i'm still on dapper, but if i upgraded i'd fix that symlink immediately
[01:39] <variant> fishsticks: it's because ubuntu switched to dash instead of bash for some strange reason
[01:39] <lullabud> mcphail:  i'm back on dapper. =P
[01:40] <sidewalk`> blackhat: cant what?
[01:40] <lullabud> mcphail:  edgy is too new, too far from standard distro.  it's cool to play with, but not for serious mission-critical stuff.
[01:40] <sidewalk`> blackhat: hold on, im going to try the removing of the broadcom-driver thing
[01:40] <Endust> why would eth1 keep getting reenabled when I ifconfig eth1 down manually? it goes back up at random times
[01:40] <blackhat> sidewalk compile ndiswrapper
[01:40] <lullabud> Endust:  i had that same problem with wireless.  so freakin irritating.  never found a solution.
[01:40] <Endust> grr
[01:40] <blackmamba> soundray: when i first installed ubuntu, i couldn't change screen resolutions properly so i went to get the ati drivers. i chose the closed-source drivers because it seemed like the better choice for my computer
[01:40] <eaglehawk> I have problem with ktorrent DHT..any ideas anybody??
[01:41] <soundray> variant: I've read this before, but it doesn't make sense to me. Whereever I look on my edgy system, it uses bash, not dash
[01:41] <phibar>  :)
[01:41] <lullabud> soundray:  the problem is that /bin/sh is a symlink to dash.
[01:41] <variant> soundray: file /bin/sh
[01:41] <blackhat> sidewalk use sudo rmmod bcm43xx to unload the broadcom module
[01:41] <lullabud> soundray:  in most other distros, including rhel, suse and ubuntu, it's a symlink to bash.
[01:41] <mcphail> soundray: your login shell will be bash, but /bin/sh will point to dash
[01:42] <lullabud> soundray:  er... dapper, not all ubuntu anymore.
[01:42] <tarsier> anybody?
[01:42] <sidewalk`> blackhat: cant compile latest ndiswrapper, get errormessages
[01:42] <soundray> lullabud, variant, mcphail: I see, thanks
[01:42] <lullabud> tarsier:  eh?
[01:42] <variant> sidewalk`: use the packages? why are you compiling it?
[01:42] <tarsier> When I updated to edgy my synaptic package manager icon in the system menu disappeared.. how do I get it back?
[01:42] <blackhat> sidewalk why arent you using the ubuntu one?
[01:43] <tarsier> or atleast run it
[01:43] <lullabud> tarsier:  that i don't know...  the application is `synaptic`, which is just a wrapper for apt-get
[01:43] <soundray> blackmamba: I think you did the right thing, however, the quality of the ATI supplied drivers has been deteriorating lately
[01:43] <jrib> tarsier: does  'synaptic' in a terminal work?
[01:43] <sidewalk`> blackhat: im going to try it again
[01:43] <Katie> ive been having problems installing my drivers on ubuntu, every time i update my driver it causes my monitor to go black :/
[01:43] <sidewalk`> blackhat: the ubuntu-one
[01:43] <blackhat> sidewalk they work in edgy in dapper they didnt
[01:44] <Katie> if anyone can help me update my driver it would be appriciated :/
[01:44] <tarsier> no
[01:44] <jrib> tarsier: what does it say?
[01:44] <blackhat> sidewalk apt-get install ndiswrapper
[01:44] <soundray> blackmamba: there is a chance that it will pick up as ATI has been acquired by AMD, but the direction is uncertain at the moment.
[01:44] <tarsier> hah thats rich.. i just had to do apt-get install synaptic ;)
[01:44] <sidewalk`> blackhat: ive already got ndiswrapper
[01:44] <keithhhhh> what do you guys use to video conference with friends using windows?
[01:44] <jrib> tarsier: make sure you have ubuntu-desktop installed
[01:44] <sidewalk`> blackhat: but hold on, lemme try something here now :P
[01:44] <sidewalk`> blackhat: im following a howto on the web
[01:45] <Saulren> Ok, I restarted Ubuntu and I am still unable to open ports.
[01:45] <tarsier> i was running breezy but upgraded to edgy
[01:45] <soundray> keithhhhh: ekiga is supposed to work
[01:45] <blackmamba> soundray: so is there anything i can do in the meantime? i can't logout or change my window manager without having to completely reboot.
[01:45] <Enoxs> Does anybody know which package i should install to install the new nvidia driver. I get an error message about a libc package who is missing?
[01:45] <keithhhhh> soundray: again much thanks
[01:45] <keithhhhh> soundray: Ill try
[01:45] <Saulren> NVM
[01:46] <tarsier> jrib, should i restart x after installing ubuntu-desktop?
[01:46] <jrib> tarsier: you should dist-upgrade
[01:46] <jrib> tarsier: what method did you use to upgrade?  I assume you dist-upgrade'd?
[01:47] <blackhat> sidewalk if the broadcom driver is loaded as you say ndiswrapper cant work
[01:47] <Saulren> I can open port 80 with apache, but it hangs on other ports
[01:47] <soundray> blackmamba: I don't know a solution, but I would try and reinstall fglrx, starting from as clean a slate as possible.
[01:47] <tarsier> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[01:47] <blackhat> sidewalk you need to unload them when you whant to use ndiswrapper
[01:47] <soundray> blackmamba: is X700 a shared memory thingy?
[01:47] <blackmamba> soundray: how do i check?
[01:47] <sidewalk`> okey
[01:47] <jrib> tarsier: yeah, you always need to make sure ubuntu-desktop is installed with that method.  So you'll need to dist-upgrade again with ubuntu-desktop installed
[01:48] <sidewalk`> ill try to unload them somehow
[01:48] <sidewalk`> gotha reboot by box now thou, to see how it works defaultly
[01:48] <blackhat> sidewalk use sudo rmmod bcm43xx

[01:57] <Agrajag> blackhat: that's not GTK
[01:57] <CharlieSu> hi
[01:57] <lufis> lullabud: Yes... sorry for not mentioning that
[01:57] <blackhat> sorry
[01:57] <Agrajag> lufis: mpd has a couple of GTK clients
[01:58] <lufis> Well, I love Amarok but it sucks in Gnome. Certain things don't work like they should
[01:58] <CharlieSu> I'm using the ubuntu 6.10 alternate CD in expert mode but when i partition disks it doesn't give me the option to partition with encryption..  Why?
[01:59] <lufis> And Rhythmbox is, pardon me, a joke
[01:59] <bruenig> lufis, have you tried listen
[01:59] <lufis> bruenig: I'm not sure. Mind linking me?
[01:59] <bruenig> lufis, http://listengnome.free.fr/
[01:59] <mnepton> lufis: Banshee
[01:59] <Enoxs> When i want to install the NVIDIA 1.0-9625 binary package, i've got an error message, missing libc. When i do an apt-cache search libc, i've got an list of packages. Which one should i install to make the thing work?
[01:59] <bruenig> lufis, still in beta but it has all the amarok bells and whistles, wikipedia, lyrics, etc
[01:59] <CharlieSu> If anyone has used ubuntu with dm-crypt please let me know...
[01:59] <lufis> bruenig: Ah, cool
[01:59] <boohoo> so is there like a bash file or something where the colors are defined for ls, etc?
[01:59] <carden> has anyone ever used sysprof? I cannot compile the module for it
[01:59] <mnepton> Enoxs: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:00] <mcphail> bruenig: doesn't play AAC files though, does it?
[02:00] <mnepton> boohoo: alias ls to ls --color
[02:00] <bruenig> mcphail, all I have are ogg
[02:00] <_azrael> ChalrieSu: I have used dm-crypt on ubuntu, but only for disk images, not for a main drive.
[02:00] <Enoxs> mnepton: thanks, i'll try this out.
[02:00] <lufis> mnepton: I've tried Banshee and I didn't like it. A Rhythmbox clone only far less functional (if that's at all possible...)
[02:00] <mcphail> bruenig: :)
[02:00] <IdiotStic> howdy. just upgraded (wiped dapper and installed edgy) and now zoom doesn't work in X. no ctrl+alt+keypad+ or - action. modes are fine in xorg.conf. I tried my old xorg.conf and also did a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, but still no zoom. snyone have a suggestion? I am using the nvidia drivers btw.
[02:00] <CharlieSu> _azrael, why doesn't the option come up for me when installing with alternate CD under manually editing partition
[02:00] <vincenz> For all linux lovers
[02:00] <vincenz> http://xkcd.com/c149.html
[02:00] <boohoo> mnepton: right, but where is this alias defined, for everytime I run ls?
[02:01] <me__> how do I setup beagle on KDE?
[02:01] <soundray> blackmamba: just found this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=150854
[02:01] <carden> idiotstic: is it possible after the upgrade your xorg.conf has only 1 resolution defined?
[02:01] <lullabud> vincenz:  LOL
[02:01] <mnepton> boohoo: your shell's rc file(s)
[02:02] <blackmamba> soundray: ooooh!
[02:02] <IdiotStic> carden: my old xorg.cong has a modeline and configs for 8 through 24 bit with modes
[02:02] <lufis> bruenig: Wow... this looks awesome. Thanks!
[02:02] <CharlieSu> _azrael did you setup with the alternate CD?
[02:02] <boohoo> vi ~/.bashrc yields a new file :(
[02:02] <carden> Anyone ever tried to compile sysprof-module-source?
[02:02] <CharlieSu> Has anyone used the Alternate CD and encryption??
[02:02] <mnepton> boohoo: so add the alias to it
[02:02] <blackmamba> soundray: that looks great, i'll boot into linux and try it right quick
[02:02] <bruenig> lufis, yeah lot of memory usage but you probably don't mind that seeing as you were using amarok
[02:02] <blackmamba> soundray: thanks for the help, and i'll be back if it doesn't work :P
[02:02] <boohoo> mnepton: no, not for my new box, for my old bsd box too
[02:03] <boohoo> i mean ubuntu box
[02:03] <eFroyd> hellow all
[02:03] <carden> idiotstic: and how about the current one? the resolution changes in X depend on having the resolutions configured, if your new one doesnt have the resolutions configured it has nothing to switch to

[02:16] <Gershon> graphics is x1600 go btw
[02:16] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Gershon about hardware
[02:16] <neobonzi> TGPO: I compiled and installed ndiswrapper myself, installed the windows driver, and have gnome-network-manager
[02:17] <SpAc> everything is working fine... just getting this "non preset mode" message from my actual LCD
[02:17] <hobophobe> Is there some sort of common logging lib/daemon that everything (xserver, kernel, irc, etc.) runs through?
[02:17] <ladydoor> lullabud: lol...'salright. i do pretty much everything computer-related in emacs and screen
[02:17] <imme-emosol> phew busy channel...
[02:17] <SpAc> its to do with the refresh rate I think
[02:17] <lullabud> ladydoor:  w?ten!  screen rules.
[02:17] <LjL> hobophobe: syslogd
[02:17] <neobonzi> TGPO: when i start up modprobe ndiswrapper it doesnt load the module
[02:17] <TGPO> neobonzi, where did you get the driver?
[02:17] <slavik> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5P6MLiKEJI
[02:17] <SpAc> when I use the vesa driver it works fine, no worry. As soon as I enable the nvidia driver it complains

[02:18] <neobonzi> TGPO - from the intel site
[02:18] <hobophobe> neat, my idea may actually be feasible

[02:18] <ladydoor> lullabud: lol...let's not get into any of that. thank you, though.
[02:18] <ricardo> thanks
[02:18] <LjL> hobophobe, not all daemons etc *have* to go through syslogd. they usually do though
[02:18] <sidewalk`> blackhat: yeah, havent found any working one for mine
[02:18] <TGPO> neobonzi, one sec, let me run something on my sys
[02:18] <neobonzi> TGPO - but its weird because intel makes a linux driver for my card...
[02:18] <neobonzi> TGPO - sure
[02:19] <hobophobe> LjL, yeah, but the more generic/common programs like that and highlight I can find out, the more possible my modular learning system will be.
[02:19] <SpAc> did a dpkg reconfigure for xorg and it doesn't matter what I put in there, the refresh rate is always 76. How can I change the refresh rate with the nvidia drivers enabled!?
[02:19] <blackhat> sidewalk :(
[02:19] <Gershon> LjL - the information on those links is outdated - the 5672 now comes with the x1600go vid card(as opposed to x1400), and thats not listed on the graphics page
[02:19] <TGPO> neo do lscpi and look for a number set in xx:xx.x format, and write it down
[02:20] <TGPO> neobonzi,  do lscpi and look for a number set in xx:xx.x format, and write it down
[02:20] <neobonzi> TGPO for my network controller?
[02:20] <TGPO> neobonzi, for the wireless card
[02:20] <neobonzi> TGPO k got it, its 0b:00.0
[02:20] <slavik> btw, for everyone here: ALSA recognises my USB audio card and flash9beta works with sound for it ...
[02:21] <LjL> Gershon, couldn't you try the CD and see if everything seems to work correctly in the "live" setup?
[02:21] <ayaa> how to generate the password to set with the command "useradd -p password newuser" ?

[02:27] <lullabud> eFroyd:  if you look through xorg.conf, you'll find a section that shows a series of depths and resolutions.  just add that resolution on each line that defines a resolution.

[02:28] <neobonzi> TGPO alright
[02:28] <eugman> Superkirbyartist, I'll have to look up the exact details but when I used nvidia I had to install propietary drivers in order to get 3d accelleration.
[02:28] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell superkirbyartist about compiz
[02:29] <superkirbyartist> I already run 64 bames 60fps.
[02:29] <neobonzi> TGPO now i remove my currently installed ndiswrapper driver?
[02:29] <earthian> ubotu tell superkirbyartist about beryl
[02:29] <SpAc> lullabud, why does it not matter what I say during a xorg reconfigure, the refresh rate will NOT change!
[02:29] <TGPO> neo yup
=== eggzeck is now known as eggzeck[laptop] 
[02:29] <eugman> Oh ok, what ubotu sent you should help then
[02:29] <lullabud> spac: i'd say it's because xorg is severely crippled in usability, but that wouldn't be very appreciative of the free software movement.
[02:29] <eaglehawk> anybody why alsa 1.0.13 not been updated in the ubuntu apt repos
[02:30] <TGPO> neobonzi, and then start the ndiswrapper driver install from scratch
[02:30] <lullabud> spac:  refresh rates are like voodoo.  you can actually permanently damage your hardware if you get them wrong.
[02:30] <superkirbyartist> OK if I installed the compiz package is that enough?
[02:30] <SpAc> lullabud, which i why i don't want to get it wrong!
[02:30] <LjL> lullabud: sort of unlikely with modern screens, fortunately
[02:30] <lullabud> spac:  fortunately i don't think you can permanently damage an LCD...

[02:31] <eaglehawk> anybody why alsa not updated to 1.0.13 in edgy yet
[02:31] <SpAc> lullabud, so there is no solution?
[02:31] <earthian> ubotu tell superkirbyartist about beryl
[02:31] <lullabud> spac:  i'd tell you my solution, but i'd get flamed. =P
[02:31] <earthian> oh
[02:31] <SpAc> lullabud, works ok if I don't use the nvidia drivers. When I use the drivers it ignores what I tell it!
[02:31] <lullabud> spac:  ah, yes... nvidia proprietary drivers add a whole extra level of bullshit.

[02:44] <lullabud> slavik:  you can use `usermod` to modify groups.
[02:44] <ladydoor> slavik: just a sec, let me read the manpage :-)
[02:44] <slavik> ladydoor: if useradd messes up anything you tell it to not mess up, we all have a greater problem
[02:44] <ftp4you> installed xmms,mplayer,vlc
[02:44] <ftp4you> nothing
[02:44] <kcfelix> well, I will try again
[02:44] <neobonzi> TGO, k back
[02:44] <ftp4you> then installed avi-win32
[02:44] <ftp4you> downloaded binaries
[02:44] <neobonzi> TGO, my network manager only says wired is working
[02:44] <socomm> ftp4you: What are you trying to do?
[02:44] <Krazy882> darn.  no kudzu to get my different NIC up and working
[02:44] <ladydoor> slavik: oh, i'm talking about an extant user, not a new one
[02:44] <ftp4you> put them into /usr/lib/win32
[02:44] <slavik> ladydoor: changing their groups?
[02:45] <ftp4you> tring to play mpg,mp3,etc
[02:45] <lullabud> Krazy882:  do you mean it didn't find it or you don't have it installed?
[02:45] <TGPO> neobonzi, did you reload it into modules after rebooting?
[02:45] <slavik> just because a group is empty, useradd or whoever should not remove the groups
[02:45] <ladydoor> slavik: this was, indeed, the question :-)
[02:45] <eFroyd> hey lulla
[02:45] <neobonzi> yep, i typed sudo modproben diswrapper
[02:45] <Krazy882> sorry.  don't have it installed.  (server version)
[02:45] <slavik> ladydoor: one way to find out ;)
[02:45] <neobonzi> *ndiswrapper
[02:45] <ftp4you> should xmms play mp3 files once installed
[02:45] <eFroyd> thank you very much my friend
[02:45] <eFroyd> :D
[02:45] <eFroyd> Really
[02:45] <socomm> !restrected

[02:45] <eFroyd> now its way better
[02:45] <lullabud> eFroyd:  did it work?
[02:45] <socomm> ftp4you: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[02:45] <eFroyd> yah man
[02:45] <slavik> TGPO: what's that about reloading into modules?
[02:45] <eFroyd> perfectly

[02:46] <slavik> TGPO: the wireless module?
[02:46] <frediie> is using automatix bad ?..
[02:46] <frediie> anyone
[02:46] <lullabud> eFroyd:  nah, brazil is actually big on the OSS stuff, isn't it?
[02:46] <ladydoor> !automatix | frediie
[02:46] <ubotu> frediie: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[02:46] <kcfelix> I need to install WinXP on my laptop for some win32 development. Well, I'm not very sure of how to do the grub restoring stuff after that and I want to be sure that I know what I'm doing 'cuse I don't wanna lose my Ubuntu
[02:46] <kcfelix> anybody that gone through WinXP instalation *after* ubuntu can give some advice?
[02:46] <kcfelix> like probable issues I could find
[02:46] <eFroyd> worked for me frediie
[02:46] <TGPO> slavik, ndiswrapper
[02:47] <slavik> TGPO: my networkmanager (on laptop) also refuses to see any wifi networks ...
[02:47] <slavik> oh
[02:47] <kcfelix> how do I make sure wich parameter I must pass for grub, etc
[02:47] <frediie> worked for me aswell, but i heard a rumor
[02:47] <Krazy882> lullabud:  I do not have kudzu installed.  server version
[02:47] <eFroyd> yah lulla
[02:47] <slavik> TGPO: wifi is on and everything but it doesn't scan for some reason ...
[02:47] <neobonzi> TGPO, maybe i nneed firmware or something?
[02:47] <kcfelix> anybody? ._.
[02:47] <frediie> it updates all the time, could have just been old bugs
[02:47] <n00blet> hey guys
[02:47] <eFroyd> brazillians love it
[02:47] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell kcfelix about grub
[02:47] <lullabud> kcfelix:  there are examples in grub.conf for windows stuff.
[02:47] <slavik> brazillians love what?
[02:47] <lullabud> kcfelix:  it's actually pretty easy.
[02:47] <eFroyd> OSS
[02:47] <n00blet> can someone lend me a hand?  I'm having some annoying problems with my .bashrc
[02:47] <slavik> ALSA > OSS
[02:47] <eFroyd> and unix
[02:47] <eFroyd> linux
[02:47] <lullabud> !ask
[02:48] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:48] <slavik> :P
[02:48] <kcfelix> lullabud: it's not risky?
[02:48] <lullabud> kcfelix:  ....which part?  using windows?  ;-)
[02:48] <kcfelix> ha, that part I know it is :)
[02:48] <TGPO> neobonzi, I'm at a loss with your card bub, that driver trick fixes the ndiswrapper issue 85% of the time, your in the 15% I havent figured out yet
[02:48] <eFroyd> well im going to keep adventuring myself here with linux , anything ill come back for u my friends
[02:48] <lullabud> kcfelix:  if you have a partition to install to, installing windows is easy.
[02:48] <neobonzi> TGPO - haha okay thanks tho buddy
[02:48] <n00blet> when I start up aterm I get the following error: bash:/home/user/.bashrc: line 250: syntax error: unexpected end of file
[02:48] <eFroyd> thank u very uch everybody and have a great night
[02:48] <n00blet> the thing is, line 250 is blank
[02:48] <logankoester> would the command "usermod -a www-data logankoester" add the user logankoester to the group www-data?
[02:49] <kcfelix> lullabud: but the real shame would be losing my ubuntu to winXP :'(
[02:49] <dennis_> hey im new to linux...and i was wondering whats a good burning program that can hanlde mp3's?
[02:49] <slavik> n00blet: pastebin it
[02:49] <lullabud> just install windows, boot to an ubuntu cd, grub-install /dev/sda or grub-install /dev/hda or whatever
[02:49] <kcfelix> lullabud: yeah, I got one
[02:49] <ladydoor> n00blet: yeah, you probably left an open quote or parenthesis dangling somewhere
[02:49] <lullabud> kcfelix:  if you don't want to lose it, back it up.
[02:49] <n00blet> slavik:  how do I pastebin?
[02:49] <slavik> !pastebin
[02:49] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:49] <ladydoor> n00blet: it means that on that line, the file ended, but it was still waiting for something to be closed
[02:49] <dennis_> hey im new to linux...and i was wondering whats a good burning program that can hanlde mp3's?
[02:50] <logankoester> the usermod command does nothing but echo it's --help no matter what arguments i give it - why?
[02:50] <n00blet> ladydoor:  I reviewed the code I wrote and nothing seems to be out of order
[02:50] <kcfelix> lullabud: /dev/hda would install grub to MBR or root partition?
[02:50] <charlie5> hi folks ... can anyone help with dhcp question ? ... my box is connected to the net via a modem/router combo, which acts as the dhcp server ... i now need to start a dhcp server on the box itself ... is this possible ?
[02:50] <slavik> dennis_: gnomebaker for gnome and k3b for kde
[02:50] <Gnewf> anyone know of any software that, if given a 1-bit image of a symbol/shape and another image, will say if that symbol appears on that image?
[02:50] <ladydoor> n00blet: would you mind pasting to paste.ubuntu-nl.org?
[02:50] <slavik> charlie5: yes
[02:50] <n00blet> ladydoor:  sure
[02:50] <ladydoor> n00blet: anything since the last time you opened a term
[02:50] <slavik> charlie5: you want your main system to act as a DHCP server instead of the router?
[02:50] <lullabud> kcfelix:  MBR.
[02:51] <kcfelix> lullabud: yeah I guess a backup would really be a good idea...
[02:51] <lullabud> kcfelix:  i always install to MBR, not sure why you'd do it other ways, but i've been doing it that way for years.
[02:51] <lullabud> kcfelix:  just back up your /etc/* and your ~/*
[02:51] <n00blet> ladydoor:  basically, I just backed up my .bashrc and then replaced the old one from edgy with my older one
[02:51] <cornell> I've just installed ubuntu server and I'm trying to get mysql working....  I found a how to at debian admin (http://www.debianadmin.com/mysql-database-server-installation-and-configuration-in-ubuntu.html)  It says do to mysqladmin -u root password your-new-password  and then mysqladmin -h root@local-machine-name -u root -p password your-new-password .  The first command, there was no response but the bash prompt.  The second command r
[02:51] <cornell> error: 'Unknown MySQL server host 'root@local-machine-name' (1)'
[02:51] <cornell> Check that mysqld is running on root@local-machine-name and that the port is 3306.
[02:51] <cornell> You can check this by doing 'telnet root@local-machine-name 3306' "  The suggested telnet didn't work, I've tried restarting mysqld, it says it stops, but can't restart, times out.   Any ideas?
[02:51] <jfrench> LjL: writer can't, I tryed, is there perhaps and open source publisher program that people know of?
[02:51] <ftp4you> what does this do Win32 audio/video plugin for libavifile
[02:51] <riddlebox> anyone using an ati graphics card?

[02:52] <slavik> riddlebox: I am
[02:52] <kcfelix> lullabud: well, I would do it to MBR directly too, but then I read some random post of a guy who had problems doing this, etc.
[02:52] <charlie5> slavik: thank you ... i'm not sure what the best setup is ... i have been using the dhcp server in the modem, but now need a dhcp server on the box as well ...
[02:52] <LjL> jfrench, i know of Scribus, but i don't know if it can load Publisher files
[02:52] <cornell> slavik... didn't realize it had gotten that large ;-) mea culpa
[02:52] <ladydoor> n00blet: i don't know what you're talking about...they don't generally change your ~/.bashrc as far as i know. but i'd be glad to look at it.
[02:52] <lullabud> kcfelix:  as long as you don't overwrite your partition table or your actual partitions, you'll be good.
[02:52] <riddlebox> variant, slavik, how did you install the driver for it?
[02:52] <slavik> charlie5: the dhcp in the router is good enough, which change it?
[02:52] <n00blet> ladydoor:  i love you... and I pasted it already ;)
[02:52] <variant> riddlebox: it came with ubuntu
[02:52] <kcfelix> lullabud: well, I really apreciate your help :) many thanks

[02:52] <lwizardl> Hi
[02:52] <charlie5> slavik: ... i don;t know what will happen if i set up a server on the box as well ... will the box get its address from the modem or the box ?
[02:53] <n00blet> ladydoor:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31800/
[02:53] <riddlebox> variant, which card is that?
[02:53] <kcfelix> lullabud: I'm going now, wish me luck :O
[02:53] <slavik> charlie5: depends on who is closer on the wire ;)
[02:53] <ademan_> when did xfree86 start?
[02:53] <slavik> and who responds faster
[02:53] <lullabud> kcfelix:  the best way to do it is to mount whatever has your /boot partition, usually just the root partition, and use `grub-install /dev/hda --root-directory="/path/to/hdlinux"
[02:53] <charlie5> slavik: :) ... i guess the box is
[02:53] <slavik> but there is no real way of knowing besides trying :P

[02:54] <Krazy882> missing kudzu.  How can I get a new NIC card up and running (driver).
[02:54] <lullabud> kcfelix:  just remember grub-install.  you'll do fine.
[02:54] <sidewalk`> the repository howto is out of date
[02:54] <lullabud> Krazy882:  apt-get install kudzu ?
[02:54] <slavik> lwizardl: firestarter and look for howtos for firestarter
[02:54] <sidewalk`> it doesnt work on the latest ubuntu
[02:54] <sidewalk`> are there any new versions of it?
[02:54] <charlie5> slavik: reason is ... a proj i'm looking at needs a dhcp server on the development box itself
[02:54] <kcfelix> lullabud: hmmmkay, I've taken note :) thanks again
[02:54] <jfrench> LjL: Ill have to try next time, Ill just go on my brothers computer, he has windoze and publisher. Thanks anyway, ill will find something another time, Thanks for your recommendations

[02:55] <elriah> Is there a virtual package that installs all the dev tools?  gcc, etc?

[02:57] <slavik> charlie5: it should be a single setting to disable the dhcp server ... or if internet is not a big deal, you can have the whatever computers connected to each other on a switch ...
[02:57] <n00blet> ladydoor: thanks a lot
[02:57] <lullabud> Krazy882:  exactly.

[02:59] <LjL> slavik yes
[02:59] <ftp4you> sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20061022-0.0_i386.deb)
[02:59] <slavik> elriah: isn't that is how the first OS was 'made' ... and are still made
[03:00] <slavik> LjL: have you read my bug report? what ya think of it?
[03:00] <SUDO_Tux> i think the problem is that i have v2.5 installed but i wanna have both 2.3 and 2.5 at the same time. any ideas?
[03:00] <Krazy882> lullabud:  Package kudzu not available.  But it is referenced by another ...
[03:00] <ladydoor> n00blet: did you post it twice? after a point it starts repeating. i didn't see anything...weird. what i'd do is comment out large blocks at a time (that go together) start an aterm, and see if the problem resolves itself. if it does, the problems's in that block and you can narrow it from there
[03:00] <sqworm> if i have files that are <filename>.tar.01 is there a way i can remove the .01 in one shot?
[03:01] <lullabud> Krazy882:  huh, you're right.  try hwdata ?
[03:01] <gyop> What is the most popular music player for ubuntu?
[03:01] <slavik> sqworm: with perl :)
[03:01] <LjL> slavik no, i don't think i have
[03:01] <variant> riddlebox: yep, your on the limmit, you should have out of the box support
[03:01] <ladydoor> n00blet: i had to do that once for a super-long rc file, but it did work
[03:01] <slavik> LjL: but you promised :(
[03:01] <ladydoor> gyop: there are lots. what's your preference? what features are you looking for?
[03:01] <LjL> gyop: open up your Add/Remove Programs thingie. it can sort things by popularity, based on a "popularity contest" package that users can opt in to
[03:01] <riddlebox> variant, we will see
[03:01] <n00blet> ladydoor: not really repeating perse being that I had to re-code certain line for compatibility with both OS X and Linux
[03:01] <variant> riddlebox: hav eyou isntalled yet?
[03:02] <lullabud> Krazy882:  honestly, i've had luck just editing /etc/network/interfaces by hand and doing an /etc/init.d/network restart
[03:02] <ladydoor> n00blet: oh, i see.
[03:02] <gyop> hmm
[03:02] <dnite> is there a way to get nvidia drivers to assist in video rendering? like HD videos or things of that sort?
[03:02] <variant> riddlebox: glxinfo | grep direct
[03:02] <n00blet> ladydoor: but I will do as you suggested and work from there.  Thanks a ton for your help.  I appreciate that you looked at it ;)
[03:02] <variant> riddlebox: that will tell you if there is 3d acceleration (it should say yes)
[03:02] <riddlebox> variant, reinstalling edgy now
[03:02] <variant> riddlebox: i see
[03:02] <slavik> dnite: only if the driver does it ...
[03:02] <gyop> ladydoor: fast and simple
[03:03] <slavik> dnite: everything is sent to the video driver ... so it makes the decisions
[03:03] <ladydoor> n00blet: good luck...
[03:03] <ladydoor> n00blet: and may the Source be with you
[03:03] <n00blet> lmao I know I know thanks
[03:03] <riddlebox> variant, my nvidia card decided with the new kernel and drivers, that it would lock  up at any given moment
[03:03] <sqworm> slavik: care to explain?
[03:03] <ricky> hey everyone
[03:03] <Krazy882> lullabud:  maybe I can use the install CD to make this file for me and then copy it to the HHD?
[03:03] <n00blet> that's one thing I hate about coding... the aftermath of finding that one problem
[03:03] <slavik> ladydoor: does source have a light side, a dark side and hold the universe together?
[03:03] <LjL> slavik: ah the gksudo issue, i forgot - yes i read it, the report sounds ok, except you don't really give any relevant context - but then i can't blame you since you don't have any that you or i could think of
[03:03] <variant> riddlebox: that is nothing new with nvidia cards

[03:04] <ladydoor> gyop: haha...check...for GNOME? KDE? N/Curses? Emacs? Command-line?
[03:04] <ricky> somebody know how to decrypt a message?
[03:04] <ladydoor> gyop: there are all kinds of things that match that :-)
[03:04] <slavik> sqworm: perl was invented as a text processing language ...
[03:04] <sqworm> so just look into a perl script thatll do it
[03:04] <sqworm> cool thanks mate.
[03:04] <slavik> sqworm: you could get a list of files, then copy or move the file from old name into a modified new name :)
[03:04] <riddlebox> variant, not good for me when it was my mythtv machine
[03:04] <gyop> ladydoor: what are you using for listen music?
[03:04] <ladydoor> slavik: yes (open/free software), yes (m$ and other proprietary), and no...but Universe packages tend to be on the light side and Multiverse on the dark
[03:04] <sqworm> bah, perl sound like a better idea.
[03:05] <n00blet> thanks guys
[03:05] <ricky> somebody know how to decrypt a message?
[03:05] <variant> riddlebox: no, thats why i never, ever buy unsupported hardware now. (i consider the need to use proprietry drivers to be unsupported)
[03:05] <LjL> ricky, yes, using a decryption algorithm.
[03:05] <Telroth_Plushie|> can anyone help me with getting ntfs write support enabled using the fuse module? I've got it working in other debian-based distros, but ubuntu doesn't want to work.
[03:05] <LjL> and a valid key, generally.
[03:05] <ladydoor> gyop: EMMS (Emacs multimedia player)...but you have to already be an emacs fan to like it, pretty much. you might like rhythmbox, or amaroK, or mocp...there are lots of Linux music players...
[03:05] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Telroth_Plushie| about fuse
[03:05] <ricky> what's that?
[03:06] <FantasticFoo> can anybody please help me?
[03:06] <slavik> ladydoor: rofl
[03:06] <LjL> ricky: what's what?
[03:06] <gyop> ladydoor: thank you
[03:06] <Pelo> FantasticFoo,  it would be helpfull if you stated your problem
[03:06] <FantasticFoo> it would be kinda nice to boot up without kernel panic
[03:06] <riddlebox> variant, ok, well rebooting and setting my apt sources we will see
[03:06] <FantasticFoo> Pelo: i did
[03:06] <FantasticFoo> i'll say it again
[03:06] <variant> riddlebox: gl
[03:07] <ladydoor> slavik: just remember to tell the storm troopers that ubotu isn't the droid they're looking for. ok, i'm done.
[03:07] <ricky> decryption algorithm
[03:07] <ladydoor> gyop: np...
[03:07] <FantasticFoo> after upgrading to edgy, i get a kernel panic at bootup
[03:07] <ricky> how i can get it?
[03:07] <LjL> ricky: by downloading a program that implements it.
[03:08] <frediie> tried reinstalling FantasticFoo
[03:08] <ricky> ok
[03:08] <john83> ubuntu is not respecting my appilcation settings
[03:08] <john83> it keeps wanting to open movies in that stupid totem player
[03:08] <john83> I HATE TOTEM
[03:08] <john83> how do I make all open with mplayer?
[03:08] <LjL> and i hate caps
[03:08] <bsnider> does anyone know the flag to compile mplayer with tv support?
[03:08] <crimsun> bsnider: read ./configure --help
[03:09] <riddlebox> variant, it says libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b direct rendering: Yes??
[03:09] <john83> bsnider: ./configure --help
[03:09] <ladydoor> john83: use the command line? or start mplayer and then select the movie from its interface (if any)?
[03:09] <Pelo> john83,  pick a movie,  rightclick   > open with > select mplayer
[03:09] <Pelo> john83,  you'll probably have to do it with each movie format
[03:09] <john83> These are workarounds, not fixes.
[03:09] <lullabud> Krazy882:  that's definitely an option.  check your /etc/network/interfaces, and your ... um....
[03:09] <Kazero>  http://ubuntufreak.blogspot.com/ <-- im following those instructions and im stuck on step 4. Can someone help me?
[03:09] <john83> I want to single-click the movie and have it open with mplayer.  It seems that some are, but anything on a remote network share is openeing instead in totem
[03:10] <john83> LjL: I bet you hate poetry too.
[03:10] <lullabud> Krazy882:  /etc/modules
[03:10] <LjL> john83: you lose
[03:10] <john83> LjL: well you obviously hate expression
[03:10] <Pelo> Kazero,  from the terminal,  and those aren'T two lines they are one line commands
[03:11] <variant> riddlebox: yeah, thats ok. nothing to worry about
[03:11] <variant> riddlebox: i get that too
[03:11] <Kazero> Pelo: I am trying that
[03:11] <variant> riddlebox: i have a rather cool setup :)
[03:11] <Kazero> sudo wget http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz/quinn.key.asc -O | sudo apt-key add -
[03:11] <variant> riddlebox: aiglx and all
[03:11] <Kazero> Thats what I type and it gives me an error
[03:11] <riddlebox> variant, all I want is tv out, do you know anything about that?
[03:11] <valehru> Hey guys, I've tried everything on this distro and I cannot get my wireless card even recognised...
[03:11] <Pelo> Kazero,  donT' type , copy and paste
[03:12] <john83> valehru: plug it in, then type dmesg | tail in a terminal
[03:12] <gyop> hey, i need some divx codes and i found it. extract to folder and i install it in terminal with runing "./instal.sh".
[03:12] <gyop> how can i uninstall it?
[03:12] <variant> riddlebox: that is a different matter.
[03:12] <LjL> john83, i don't think, i do hate it when my carefully-chosen regexp highlights, to make me get a sense from the channel and have an idea of what's going on at a glance, become useless because someone types a sentence in all capitals thus shouting it over everybody else's
[03:12] <variant> riddlebox: that may not work by default. afaik the proprietry drivers dont alwasy support it either
[03:12] <john83> gyop: read the install script and hope you can uninstall it.  next time use apt
[03:12] <Pelo> gyop,   have you tried ./remove ?
[03:12] <variant> !tvout
[03:12] <ubotu> For help with enabling the TV-Out on certain NVidia cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaTVOutNewbieEdition
[03:13] <john83> LjL: I advise you to get over it?  :-*  It's difficult to express in text, hence *bold* or CAPITALS might be used.
[03:13] <gyop> hmm john83, =o\
[03:13] <gyop> Pelo no i didn't. now im trying..
[03:13] <LjL> john83, i'd get over it if the channel rules didn't say i'm right
[03:13] <LjL> !caps
[03:13] <ubotu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[03:14] <john83> LjL: You know where you can shove your channel rules.  there's a difference between shouting and emphasizing
[03:14] <LjL> where john83?
[03:14] <ladydoor> john83: please just stop now. there's no need to get hostile.
[03:14] <[DFC] Eggman> but you were shouting
[03:14] <john83> LjL: take a guess.
[03:14] <Kazero> Peno: That worked, thanks

[03:15] <livingdaylight> gnomebaker is frozen. Anyone know a command to kill the process?
[03:16] <ChocoCid> ps -e
[03:16] <ChocoCid> then kill the one with that number
[03:16] <ladydoor> livingdaylight: killall -s KILL gnomebaker
[03:16] <ChocoCid> (ex: kill 1234)
[03:16] <slavik> who was asking about a file renamer?
[03:16] <livingdaylight> ladydoor, thx
[03:16] <Pelo> livingdaylight,   open the system manager and kill if from there
[03:16] <sidewalk`> how do i apply a diff to a source?
[03:16] <sidewalk`> .diff
[03:16] <jrib> sidewalk`: patch
[03:16] <slavik> sidewalk`: man patch
[03:16] <slavik> isn't diff kind of like journaling but then patch is like commiting?
[03:17] <ladydoor> livingdaylight: you might check out k3b or bashburn...i've had a lot of success with the latter, personally :-)
[03:17] <valehru> john83, its not turning up in that dmsg.
[03:17] <ladydoor> livingdaylight: and if it doesn't work, you can just hit control-c to kill it.
[03:17] <FantasticFoo> you're kidding, right?
[03:17] <valehru> john83, lspci: 01:05.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g]  802.11g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)
[03:17] <slavik> valehru: ndiswrapper or bcm43xx driver?
[03:17] <livingdaylight> ladydoor, yea, gnomebaker is an inferior application.  I don' tknow bashburn, but K3B is awesome
[03:18] <valehru> slavik, well I blacklisted the bcm43xx driver....I attempted to use every ndiswrapper driver I could find...but none seem to work.
[03:18] <ladydoor> livingdaylight: i don't know that it's inferior so much as not as developed yet.
[03:18] <slavik> valehru: ndiswrapper is not a solution ...
[03:19] <ChocoCid> broadcom :(
[03:19] <slavik> uh oh?
[03:19] <lwizardl> why is it when it comes to a ubuntu desktop everyone is able to help, but when it comes to a web server no one ever answers anything, what you guys automatically think its someone trying to break into a machine?
[03:19] <slavik> LjL: may I ask?
[03:19] <valehru> slavik, so what would you recommend?  I had it working perfectly on dapper before....now it comes to edgy and its screwed up.
[03:19] <wd> nalioth hey long time for me, what's up?
[03:19] <ChocoCid> would presume pm's
[03:19] <livingdaylight> ladydoor, not as developed is a euphemism for it sux
[03:19] <LjL> slavik: yes
[03:19] <slavik> LjL: what did he have to knoe better about?
[03:19] <slavik> know*
[03:20] <wd> ChocoCid,  whats up?
[03:20] <jrib> lwizardl: it's more likely that no one knows the answer
[03:20] <ChocoCid> not much
[03:20] <ladydoor> livingdaylight: well...that's one way of looking at it, i guess. i just associate "inferior" with "inherently lesser" rather than "under development"
[03:20] <LjL> slavik: that's just my standard ban message.
[03:20] <slavik> :(
[03:20] <slavik> LjL: do you think there is a market for Linux Games?
[03:20] <LjL> slavik: i don't know, i'd say yes, but i'm not a marketeer
[03:21] <ChocoCid> there's a market
[03:21] <nalioth> wd: join me in #ubuntu-offtopic
[03:21] <slavik> personal opionion ...
[03:21] <ChocoCid> alt.org/nethack !
[03:21] <zerosmok1> yes
[03:21] <zerosmok1> there is
[03:21] <wd> nalioth,  u know i need ur help huh?  lol i'm going.
[03:21] <slavik> hmm, I wish my IP address was 1.1.1.1 :D
[03:21] <asdf_> i installed kubuntu-desktop and it screwed up my human theme in gnome does anyone know where I can get the original human gtk for dapper?
[03:21] <iter> 1.1.1.1 is reserved
[03:21] <ChocoCid> with ipv6 you have a shot at 1.1.1.1.1.1 !
[03:21] <dk0r> Is this guide safe for a linux user? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-36653.html
[03:22] <ChocoCid> (though it'll probably get reserved)
[03:22] <slavik> valehru: bcm43xx is the solution ... although not elegant
[03:22] <shadowhywind> anyone know of a good program to recover files lost on a harddrive
[03:22] <sidewalk`> hell, bcm43xx is no solution
[03:22] <sidewalk`> im having lots of problems with it
[03:22] <ladydoor> dk0r: playing around with xorg.conf is always risky, but it's not going to destroy the world if you make backups
[03:22] <sidewalk`> cant get my damn wlan-card working
[03:22] <variant> anyone know if there are any alternative boot splashes except the three ubuntu ones?
[03:22] <asdf_> anyone know where to install the human gtk theme?
[03:22] <slavik> sidewalk`: ndiswrapper is a workaround ... a dirty one at that
[03:22] <sidewalk`> slavik: im trying, but its not helping
[03:23] <valehru> slavik, would ya mind helping me get it up and running then?
[03:23] <Daylighter> Hey all
[03:23] <Krazy882> lullabud:  ok, I got it!!!!  Here is what I did.
[03:23] <sidewalk`> my damn orange light in the front of the laptop wont start blinking
[03:23] <sidewalk`> i have an acer aspire 502x
[03:23] <variant> shadowhywind: yeah, magicrescue. i used it to recover about 500 out of 510 files from a digital camera, but you can use it on any storage medium
[03:23] <ladydoor> dk0r: just make sure you back up any important file before playing with it, and then if something breaks, but your original back in place (and maybe back up the modified one so you can try to figure out what went wrong)
[03:23] <Alethes> anybody know if the latest evolution struggles with imap?
[03:23] <variant> shadowhywind: all the images had previously been deleeted
[03:23] <Krazy882> Because a new NIC was found. Ubuntu put it on as ETH1 INSTEAD of ETH0
[03:23] <Kazero> So ive determined that XGL doesnt work for everyone
[03:23] <lullabud> Krazy882:  ah-ha
[03:23] <shadowhywind> its not pictures i am trying to recover, is that a problem?
[03:24] <slavik> valehru: install the fwcutter thingy
[03:24] <dk0r> ladydoor: How do I that in the console? 'cp file dir' and thats all?
[03:24] <Kazero> http://ubuntufreak.blogspot.com/ <-- Doesnt work in my Edgy VMWare copy
[03:24] <variant> shadowhywind: no, what file type is it?
[03:24] <slavik> !bcom
[03:24] <Krazy882> simply change the /etc/network/interfaces accordingly...  Wa LA!!!!
[03:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bcom - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:24] <slavik> !broadcomm
[03:24] <ChocoCid> !broadcom
[03:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about broadcomm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:24] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:24] <ChocoCid> spell it right and it might work :P
[03:24] <dk0r> ladydoor: Is there a way to copy the file I want to backup into the same dir as the original and compress it ?
[03:24] <ladydoor> dk0r: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
[03:24] <slavik> :P
[03:24] <at0m> whats the coool gmail app that checks ur gmail mail for linux? :)
[03:24] <shadowhywind> its a password file, from a program called keepass
[03:24] <dk0r> ladydoor: what does .bak do ?
[03:24] <variant> at0m: apt-cache search gmail
[03:24] <ChocoCid> gmail-notify
[03:24] <Katie> is it possible to get starcraft to open in just a window instead of full screen on wine?
[03:24] <Krazy882> lyllabud:  Thanks man!  you were the key to figuring it al out.
[03:24] <at0m> thanks
[03:24] <valehru> !Broadcom
[03:24] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:24] <dk0r> ladydoor: makes a copy and add's .bak as extension ?
[03:24] <ladydoor> dk0r: then after that you could do sudo bzip2 /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
[03:24] <ChocoCid> Katie: open it from within winefile, maybe?
[03:24] <slavik> run that script
[03:24] <Pelo> at0m,   evolution can check your gmail
[03:25] <slavik> then modprobe bcm43xx
[03:25] <variant> Katie: i dont know about that but you can always launch it in a nested xserver
[03:25] <Krazy882> gotta run now.  Hear a wife comming home.
[03:25] <shadowhywind> the person with the broacom chip, what chip do you have?
[03:25] <ladydoor> dk0r: the way cp works is this:  cp <originalfile> <newfile>
[03:25] <Krazy882> thanks all!
[03:25] <sidewalk`> which script?
[03:25] <dk0r> ladydoor: i understand.
[03:25] <lullabud> Krazy882:  well you did all the hard work so you're the one who deserves the credit :)
[03:25] <slavik> Krazy882: show her ubuntu :)
[03:25] <boohoo> if I have patch file, can i just do patch someFile.patch * in my directory, and it will apply patches correct?
[03:25] <variant> shadowhywind: what kind of files is it?
[03:25] <slavik> sidewalk`: above
[03:25] <slavik> oops
[03:25] <ladydoor> dk0r: you could change the name to /etc/X11/pudding if you wanted, but .bak is easier to remember
[03:25] <slavik>  /usr/share/bcm43xx-fwcutter/install_bcm43xx_firmware.sh
[03:25] <dk0r> ladydoor: I wasnt aware changing the format of the copy was so easy.
[03:25] <Krazy882> lullabud:  sometimes all we need is an ear.  you da man!
[03:25] <sidewalk`> i dont have fwcutter in my apt-get install
[03:25] <ladydoor> dk0r: that doesn't change the format, it just notes that it's a backup copy
[03:26] <at0m> does everyone have lag when trying to move windows like firefox around in a circle fairly fast or is it just me?
[03:26] <Katie> so look up nested xserver... k
[03:26] <valehru> slavik, thanks, never knew this page existed...it should be marked as a sticky in the How to Section..
[03:26] <Pelo> at0m, you can find instructions for setup of clients in the gmail site , you need to enable gmail for retreval , there are no specific instructions for evolution on the site take the info from the other clent  instruions
[03:26] <slavik> sidewalk`: check if the script is there
[03:26] <Kazero> Anyone know of a way I can fix this? I have XGL installed using this guide: http://ubuntufreak.blogspot.com/ . When I try and start using XGL, the screen flashes, artifacts go nuts, gnome loads, then it pops back to the login page
[03:26] <Daylighter> anyone know of a good audio player that manages my library better than xmms?
[03:26] <ladydoor> dk0r: bzip2, however, will compress it and add .bz2 at the end of the .bak
[03:26] <shadowhywind> its a .key and .kdb
[03:26] <slavik> sidewalk`: or make sure you have universe and multiverse enabled
[03:26] <at0m> running kubuntu , does it have evolution?
[03:26] <variant> shadowhywind: what are those? text based documents or some encryption stuff or what?
[03:26] <slavik> at0m: it will if you install it ;)
[03:26] <ladydoor> dk0r: however, xorg.conf is not a very large file, so unless you're pressed for space i wouldn't bother with compression.
[03:26] <[DFC] Eggman> Kazero: Try using the wiki's guide
[03:27] <variant> shadowhywind: unless they contain predictable headers and footers then it will be hard to recover
[03:27] <Kazero> [DFC] Eggman: Link?
[03:27] <CharlieSu> has anyone used encryption with the live CD for their /home partition?
[03:27] <shadowhywind> one is a text and one is a encryption
[03:27] <sidewalk`> slavik: how do i check if i have universe enabled ?
[03:27] <sidewalk`> slavik: i tried doing that earlier, but it didnt work
[03:27] <slavik> !repositories
[03:27] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[03:27] <slavik> !easysource
[03:27] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[03:27] <ladydoor> dk0r: good luck...and if you'll excuse me, i have to go. have a nice evening.
[03:27] <variant> shadowhywind: forget the encryption key - it's gone. the other file.. what kind of text? is it a document with formatting or is it just plain text?
[03:27] <dk0r> ladydoor: lets say I do 'sudo cp x/x/1 x/x/2.bak' 1 is a jpg. So will the copy end up looking like this, 2.jpg or like this? 2.jpg.bak
[03:27] <ssokolow> I'm trying to set up my brother's nVidia-based machine with Ubuntu but it only gives me a 640x480 desktop and Ubiquity seems to need at least 800x600. Does Ubiquity offer an ncurses-based mode or should I use that X11 option to have a desktop bigger than the screen? (and in the latter case, what was the xorg.conf option for that? I forget.)
[03:27] <rc-1> mplayer firefox plugin installed, but wont open up videos :( i also have installed realplayer10
[03:28] <shadowhywind> i don't really know
[03:28] <variant> shadowhywind: ok, what program created it?
[03:28] <CharlieSu> Any encryption buffs in the channel tonight?  I'm trying to use the Alternate CD to setup an encrypted partition...  But the option doesn't show on the expert mode.. Please Hehlp
[03:28] <variant> CharlieSu: that's not an option included in the installer unfortunatly
[03:28] <shadowhywind> keepass, its a windows program
[03:28] <at0m> linux using 2GB of my memory. im shocked
[03:28] <lwizardl> I have a ubuntu webserver I setup I can login using ssh when connected via the same network but if I try to login from a outside network i get permission denied using the same login/pass. Anyone know whats going on? I can login using ssh but if i try ssh-add IPADDRESS i get "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent."
[03:28] <slavik> dk0r: 2.bak in that case
[03:28] <variant> shadowhywind: I am not familliar with it. how was the file lost? was it deleeted?
[03:29] <LjL> at0m: it tries to make efficient use of memory, yes
[03:29] <ssokolow> at0m: You are aware that Linux tries to use as much memory as possible, using "unused memory" for buffers, right?
[03:29] <variant> lwizardl: firewall rule blocking you?
[03:29] <shadowhywind> i had the file on my ipod, which i then reformated and forgot to copy the file off
[03:29] <CharlieSu> variant, the install docs say that it is.. Do you want the URL?
[03:29] <quinnster> No Wifi -- Ubuntu 6.10 on Toshiba Satellite P25-S507 (Atheros AR5001X <ar5211 chipeset>).  It doesn't even see ath0/wifi0.  It works on similar model without issues.  Can anyone point me in the right direction on what I need to do?  Thanks.
[03:29] <at0m> no. good to know :)
[03:29] <slavik> lwizardl: use firestarter to open the port and are you behind a firewall router?
[03:29] <variant> at0m: yes, the memory actualy being activly used is not more than you might expect
[03:30] <CharlieSu> variant, go here..  It says you can with the Alternate CD, but i Can't seem to find it.. https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html
[03:30] <slavik> at0m: check top for real memory usage ...
[03:30] <boohoo> eduhat: compiled!
[03:30] <slavik> because a library used by 2 apps, even if laoded once, can be counted 2 times
[03:30] <shadowhywind> how would i use magic recover?
[03:30] <nohop> fd
[03:31] <at0m> "top"? im looking at xubuntu system monitor

[03:32] <CharlieSu> variant
[03:32] <CharlieSu> did you see link?
[03:33] <at0m> sharing swap drive between ubuntu and kbuntu isnt an issue, right ?
[03:33] <quinnster> nope
[03:33] <variant> CharlieSu: sorry no
[03:33] <variant> CharlieSu: again please?
[03:33] <Flannel> at0m: you should share a normal drive.  They overlap by about 80%
[03:33] <zerosmok1> don't think so
[03:33] <slavik> at0m: shouldn't be ...
[03:33] <at0m> can someone do me a favor / test ???? .... try moving a firefox window around rapidly in a circle... see if you chunk to crap....
[03:33] <CharlieSu> https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html
[03:34] <CharlieSu> it shows that you can do encryption...  search on that page
[03:34] <variant> CharlieSu: ah, cool. didnt know it was included. thnx
[03:34] <at0m> or any rather large window
[03:34] <zerosmok1> at0m, what ram you got?
[03:34] <variant> CharlieSu: yeah, doesnt mean i know how to do it :P
[03:34] <CharlieSu> variant, it doesn't work for me.. I don't see it when trying to install.. but it is in the docs
[03:34] <at0m> 2GB .. all being used apparently.
[03:34] <Flannel> at0m: install ubuntu, then apt-get kubuntu-desktop (or other wayaround) You don't need to dualboot for ubuntu and kubuntu.
[03:34] <CharlieSu> is debian-installer what i'm using when i do expert mode on the alternate cd?
[03:35] <dk0r> Help! I do not have the permissions to save /etc/X11/xorg.confg which Im edited in gedit.
[03:35] <Flannel> CharlieSu: alternate CD is debian installer, yes.  Or, probably anyway.  Where is it referenced?
[03:35] <at0m> cool. thnx for tip flannel
[03:35] <zerosmok1> at0m: 2GB don't think you should have a problem
[03:35] <Flannel> dk0r: use gksudo to start gedit
[03:35] <quinnster> Can anyone give me any tips on installing an atheros driver?  Ubuntu 6.10
[03:35] <at0m> did someone do the test in 6.10 ?
[03:35] <dk0r> Flannel: what is gksudo ?
[03:35] <dk0r> Flannel: gk?
[03:35] <Flannel> dk0r: it'll run gedit with full perms
[03:35] <CharlieSu> Flannel, I'm trying to use encryption on the alternate CD for my /home directory linke shown in https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html but I don't see it as an option.. Am i doing something wrong?
[03:36] <zerosmok1> sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.confg
[03:36] <zerosmok1> should get you in
[03:36] <Flannel> zerosmok1: no, gksudo
[03:36] <Baconbutty> Oh goody, xchat put me into the ubuntu chat by default. My question is I have a TV tuner card, but I don't know what it is! What command do I use to get a list of PCI cards and their names?
[03:36] <dk0r> Flannel: does gedit not have permissions because the file is currentlly being used?
[03:36] <Pelo> dk0r,  gksu or gksudo is a way to get gui application to run in root
[03:36] <Flannel> dk0r: no, gedit normally doesn't have permissions becuase you're opening it as your user, not the super user
=== zerosmok1 is now known as zerosmoke
[03:37] <dk0r> Flannel: thanks.
[03:37] <dk0r> Pelo: sudo=su
[03:37] <dk0r> ?
[03:37] <CharlieSu> variant, if you figure it out and let me know I would really apprtiate it..  Or let me know another irc channel where i can ask
[03:37] <Pelo> dk0r,  more or less
[03:37] <Flannel> dk0r: sort of
=== zerosmoke is now known as ZeroSmoke
[03:37] <dk0r> what does the gk in gksu/sudo stand for ?
[03:37] <Flannel> CharlieSu: yeah.  The alternate CD
[03:38] <Pelo> dk0r,   the gk stand for gtk which is the gui manager or something
[03:38] <CharlieSu> Flannel, I'm using the alternative CD but don't have the option.. Am I supposed to do something special?
[03:38] <dk0r> Pelo: So I have a few options. 'gksu gedit', 'gksudo gedit' and 'sudo gedit'
[03:39] <dk0r> Pelo: correct?
[03:39] <Baconbutty> Okay, no commands? Is there a program I can apt get or that comes with the OS itself that tells me what hardware I have installed and if there's drivers for it?
[03:39] <Pelo> dk0r, yeah
[03:39] <Flannel> CharlieSu: Are you in the Partition Setting menu?
[03:39] <ChocoCid> preferably don't do sudo for graphical applications
[03:39] <ne78> I'm running debian etch i would like to upgrade to ubuntu edgy/eft (i'm a very experienced user i can play with dpkg is needed), is there an howto ? (reinstallation is not an option and i don't have a cd drive)
[03:39] <ChocoCid> sometimes there are issues with that
[03:39] <dk0r> Pelo: /me uses the shortest.
[03:39] <air0day> Is there a tutorial somewhere for how to setup CIFS?  I have a Wester Digital Netcenter drive, and regular smbfs isn't working for me.
[03:39] <CharlieSu> yes..
[03:39] <CharlieSu> Flannel, 6.10 is that okay?
[03:39] <Flannel> !upgrade | ne78, there's a debian to ubuntu thing on this page, I think.

[03:41] <ricky> can someone tell me how decrypt a message?
[03:42] <ne78> Flannel: thanks but i know how to use google if i ask here it's because i couldn't find anything with google
[03:42] <Pelo> ricky, try looking it up in the forum
[03:42] <Flannel> ne78: er. what?  The Installation wiki page... it's not google.
[03:42] <CharlieSu> Flannel, I am in the partition settings menu..  When i select a drive it doesn't give that option..  Any help?
[03:42] <dk0r> bruenig: Thats a good site. Im new to nix and have been using it alot. He speaks english. English is good!
[03:42] <jrib> ricky: it depends on how something is encrypted
[03:43] <blehnarfdjfkl> okay, i'm experiencing the problem that's been pretty well documented in edgy about vncpassword 'dissapearing' after each reboot.  Thing is, right now i can hit the PC running ubuntu and it prompts me for authentication.  Doe anyone know what this password is?!?!  (my password isn't working - is there a consistent 'broken' one i can use?)
[03:43] <Flannel> CharlieSu: sorry, I have no idea.
[03:43] <qc_> Hello - does anyone know of a terminal that will alow true ANSI font, or how do i make ansi fonts work with ubuntu??? - the irc client bitchx looks horrible unless its running true ansi
[03:43] <CharlieSu> Flannel, do youthink it is possible that it was left out in 6.10 ?
[03:44] <blehnarfdjfkl> heh
[03:44] <bruenig> CharlieSu, I partitioned mine in edgy
[03:44] <eon__> qc_ i have no problems with irssi
[03:44] <Flannel> CharlieSu: doubt it.  This is a new document for edgy, as far as Im aware

[04:08] <systest> riddlebox: yes, that's what the "-j" is for
[04:08] <scorp007> umm, is this normal? $ modprobe fglrx
[04:08] <scorp007> FATAL: Error running install command for fglrx
[04:08] <AdamKili> aahhh.......is VMware the best and easiest you know about?
[04:08] <bruenig> scorp007, generally something that begins with all caps fatal is not normal
[04:08] <quinnster> vmware -- qemu ?
[04:08] <scorp007> bruenig: thats what i thouhgt, any help on how to resolve it?
[04:09] <bruenig> no
[04:09] <DjViper> *meep*
[04:09] <ortega10> i have this problem, the ooo2 quickstart tray icon doesn't persist after i restart my system, and i don't know how to restart it in the commandline... any ideas?
[04:10] <DjViper> eek
[04:10] <Lahey> mosix? anyone!
[04:10] <AdamKili> quinnster: isn't qemu a command line program? i think i tried it but couldn't figure it out......i need a GUI    0_0   O_O   lol
[04:10] <lifepositive> Lahey: hi there
[04:11] <Lahey> lifepositive: hello!
[04:11] <lifepositive> Lahey: :)
[04:11] <ortega10> Lahey: google is your friend http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=287438
[04:11] <riddlebox> systest, what would the line in /etc/fstab look like?
[04:11] <quinnster> I believe it's initiated via command line, but in the end it's a 'GUI' (well, emulator for whatever you put in it...DOs, Win, Linux, etc.)
[04:11] <MaHaGoN> lwizardl the only thing I can think of if you can get to it from your internal network, but not an external network is you dont have access due to a firewall issue?  Idk, seems like a very odd problem to me
[04:11] <iter> lwizardl: you can ssh to localhost on port 22 from the machine ?
[04:11] <quinnster> I think there's a KQemu for KDE also
[04:11] <Rug> Howdy all
[04:12] <iter> lwizardl: and you can ssh to the machine from the local subnet, on a different box?
[04:12] <Lahey> lifepositive: you dont happen to know anything about mosix on ubuntu?
[04:12] <lwizardl> iter: yes i can ssh into the box using my desktop
[04:12] <Pelo> Lahey,  try looking it up in the forum
[04:12] <Lahey> ok, will do
[04:12] <iter> lwizardl: and the gateway for your subnet, what do you know about it
[04:13] <The_Machine> i'm sad.  i have so much work to do from home tonight but i can't get into my PC via VNC
[04:13] <iter> lwizardl: you can connect to port 22 but can't login ?
[04:13] <lifepositive> Lahey: no sorry
[04:13] <The_Machine> could someone give me a hand?
[04:13] <lifepositive> !mosix
[04:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mosix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:13] <lwizardl> iter: I can loging just fine from any pc on my network, but if I go to anyone's house and try to ssh in i get permission denied
[04:13] <systest> riddlebox: check the man page and the other lines for examples, it would look something like:
[04:13] <AdamKili> quinster: i want to get a windows XP home edition emulator going, does that work in qemu, and do u mind helping me if i can't figure it out on the second time?
[04:14] <systest> riddlebox: /dev/fg/myth /mount/point   ext3  defaults  0  2
[04:14] <Lahey> lifepositive: thats ok, i think i found something on the net...
[04:14] <bimberi> lwizardl: do you have port 22 on your router forwarded to that machine?
[04:14] <lwizardl> iter: can't do a direct login on the machine its headless
[04:14] <iter> lwizardl: and the router for your network, what do you know about it
[04:14] <lwizardl> bimberi: yes
[04:14] <lwizardl> iter: I'm the person that set it up
[04:14] <iter> lwizardl: and when you ssh to your router, do you get a login prompt ?
[04:14] <lwizardl> yes
[04:15] <lifepositive> Lahey: good stuff :)
[04:15] <iter> lwizardl: first thing is to triple check that port 22 on the router is acutally forwarded to the machine
[04:15] <Lahey> back to my first q of the night, what kernal does Ubuntu 6.06.1 run, cant find it on the site

[04:15] <Lahey> lifepositive: not so sure as of yet.
[04:15] <The_Machine> okay, i'm experiencing the problem that's been pretty well documented in edgy about vncpassword 'dissapearing' after each reboot.  Thing is, right now i can hit the PC running ubuntu and it prompts me for authentication.  Doe anyone know what this password is?!?!  (my password isn't working - is there a consistent 'broken' one i can use?)
[04:15] <Rug> cam:  np
[04:15] <Rug> cam: no
[04:15] <iter> lwizardl: and this router, is it a regular home-type router, linksys or netgear etc ?
[04:16] <lwizardl> iter: Yes quad checked port 22 is forwarded to my webserver static ip
[04:16] <systest> Lahey: 2.6.15.6 see: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/releasenotes/606

[04:17] <Lahey> and of course OpenMosix only runs on 2.4
[04:17] <Munchkinguy> (or that don't)
[04:17] <bimberi> lwizardl: I've pastebinned by (unchanged since install) /etc/sshd_config at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31808/ .  You could compare it to yours.

[04:18] <bimberi> lwizardl: oops, make that /etc/ssh/sshd_config

[04:19] <The_Machine> hehe
[04:19] <Crescendo_> Why is firefox so crashy in Edgy?
[04:19] <DjViper> iter: something other than a default port

[04:19] <The_Machine> Crescendo never had it crash
[04:19] <The_Machine> it's 2.0 though
[04:20] <Crescendo_> I highlight something and click the wrong way and it locks up

[04:24] <lwizardl> iter: did you say anything i got d/c
[04:24] <iter> lwizardl: please do tail -f /var/log/auth.log and try to login from outside network

[04:28] <kevin__> any suggestions on where to go to ask about dev to help with this?
[04:28] <iter> lwizardl: your router, does it have openwrt or ddwrt by any chance?
[04:28] <kevin__> I've heard others with the same prob
[04:28] <iter> lwizardl: I suspect you're trying to ssh into the router itself
[04:28] <lwizardl> iter: not that i know of
[04:28] <Rug> kevin__: call ATI
[04:28] <The_Machine> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79069&page=2&highlight=vnc+password <--is there any solution anyone knows of?!
[04:28] <kevin__> Rug will that help?

[04:29] <kevin__> So far nothings on there site
[04:29] <Munchkinguy> Yes! That means I can use the LAME binary without breaking the law!

[04:29] <seamus7> Hi... I've downloaded the Edgy iso ... is it possible to mount the iso and install that way?

Keyboard doesn't do anything and neither does the mouse.. I have to hard reset even though I can see things working on the screen...
[04:31] <dk0r> ladydoor: What does that have to do with my mouse buttons?
[04:31] <seamus7> Rug: yeah I upgraded from Dapper but now I'd like to do a fresh clean install or reinstallation.

[04:32] <eneried> hello everybody, do you know if Edgy is better than ddapper or if it's better to keep on dapper by a little time?
[04:32] <iter> The_Machine: looks like a bug
[04:32] <dk0r> ladydoor: MS TrackBall Explorer. Its a mouse.
[04:32] <Rug> seamus7: a "fresh install" implies that you nuke/format and reinstall.  Not "copy-over" like lots of folks thought helped with WinXP
[04:32] <dnite> iter, keyboard doesn't respond.. neither does the mouse..
[04:32] <adaran> hey everyone - anyone know why my core 2 duo doesn't do SMP with the 2.6.17-10-generic kernel?

[04:32] <irunwithscissors> ortega did u try typing "explorer.exe" at the commandline?
[04:32] <adaran> what happened to the smp kernels anyway?
[04:32] <kevin__> Maurox what experience do you have with these type of probs?
[04:32] <iter> smp is now in generic
[04:32] <dnite> ixian_, i'm trying in there too.. i THINK i've secluded the problem to only when compiz/beryl is running.. but i figured i'd try here too..
[04:32] <dnite> iter, the keyboard doesn't do ANYTHING
[04:33] <adaran> okay, better question: HOW to enable smp?

[04:33] <lwizardl> iter: done that what do i do to force the ssh on my system to restart
[04:33] <Rug> seamus7: do you have another computer?  A floppy drive?
[04:33] <kevin__> it is an older card and not covered with the official ati multi driver
[04:33] <iter> adaran: and I assume you checked bios for HT enable or some core 2 specific setting  ?
[04:33] <adaran> iter: also, APIC is disabled - because the system won't boot with it - on the other hand, windows won't boot without.
[04:34] <seamus7> Rug: I have a floppy drive and a USB memory stick.

[04:42] <specialbuddy> an easier less redneck way?

[04:45] <ladydoor> vega__: ln -s /path/to/folder /path/to/link
[04:45] <specialbuddy> vega, it's a link
[04:45] <Adrian_> <Pelo> Thats why i'm doing, no luck
[04:45] <jair> hey guys? how can get the video player have more codecs to get quicktime and mpeg videos, or should i try to install xine?
[04:45] <adaran> lwizardl: tcp wrappers, try /etc/hosts.allow and such
[04:45] <iter> lwizardl: /etc/hosts.allow and hosts.deny
[04:45] <dk0r> How does one setup a pc/osx/ubuntu friendly network ?
[04:45] <Pelo> Adrian_,  like I said,  getting a cd is better
[04:45] <Maurox> kevin__: this is the last http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man4/r128.4.html with that you are able to configure your card :)
[04:45] <ladydoor> vega__: that'll create a symlink ("shortcut" is windisease (windows+ese) for "link")
[04:46] <specialbuddy> dk0r, get windows because Ubuntu sucks for that
[04:46] <Pelo> vega-,  rightclick the folder and use make a link ( or shortcut, not sure what it is in english)
[04:46] <Adrian_> <Pelo> I'd rather not have to backup all my files and stuff and move them to a temp partition etc
[04:46] <dk0r> specialbuddy: Get windows?
[04:46] <tritium> specialbuddy: be reasonable!
[04:46] <Rug> specialbuddy: just because you can't do it means it's impossible
[04:46] <ladydoor> Pelo: it's link :-)
[04:46] <dk0r> specialbuddy: You mean i cannot network ubuntu and xp and osx ?
[04:46] <Rug> dk0r: ignore him.  He's bitter
[04:46] <specialbuddy> not easily
[04:46] <Pelo> Adrian_,  did you do the set where you change the repos from dapper to edgy ?
[04:47] <tritium> dk0r: you can, he's exaggerating based on his own difficulties
[04:47] <dk0r> tritium: heh.
[04:47] <specialbuddy> get gentoo then
[04:47] <dk0r> Well I am new to nix.
[04:47] <iter> dk0r: your question was a bit vague-- a tcp/ip network will work well with all those os's
[04:47] <Rug> specialbuddy: please leave if you are going to be like that
[04:47] <specialbuddy> it's supposed to be a harder distro to use but I can do it on there for some reason and I'm total noob
[04:47] <dk0r> iter: I just want to share files via tcp/ip
[04:47] <kevin__> RU ok walking me throu a bit?
[04:48] <Adrian_> <Pelo>i've tried gksu "update-manager -c" and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. It just says nothing to update
[04:48] <Pelo> Adrian_,  hold on
[04:48] <dk0r> specialbuddy: What do you do? Just set the ip and subnet's and thats it ?
[04:48] <dk0r> specialbuddy: All the computers see eachother??
[04:48] <dk0r> specialbuddy: That seems too easy.
[04:49] <specialbuddy> usually it's as easy as getting samba
[04:49] <Flannel> !samba | dk0r
[04:49] <ubotu> dk0r: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[04:49] <Adrian_> Pelo: I've also tried changing apt sources to a different countries one, did help.
[04:49] <DelawareAEA> hello.  does anyone here have experience with jdelay?  i'm using it to check the latency on jack
[04:49] <dk0r> ubotu: What about osx?
[04:49] <specialbuddy> I did it in dapper dk0r but edgy is not going so smooth
[04:49] <Adrian_> Pelo: didn't*
[04:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about What about osx? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:49] <dk0r> specialbuddy: I am in daper.
[04:50] <specialbuddy> get samba
[04:50] <dk0r> That a distro or app ?
[04:50] <ChocoCid> app
[04:50] <specialbuddy> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Samba_Server
[04:50] <specialbuddy> just get it on synaptic
[04:50] <specialbuddy> use that guide
[04:50] <vega__> I'm having trouble using amarok.
[04:50] <ivx> hey i have an expresscard on my note book. if i get a firewire card for it does anyone know if it will be supported?
[04:50] <vega__> Whenever I click a song and click play, it just goes straight to 'playlist finished'.
[04:50] <vega__> And never plays the song.
[04:51] <adaran> vega__: audio output problems, most likely
[04:51] <dk0r> specialbuddy: I want to use apt-get. Im sick of the gui. I would just type 'sudo apt-get install samba' ?
[04:51] <vega__> Well it never shows that is playing.
[04:51] <vega__> It just instantly goes to 'playlist finished'.
[04:51] <specialbuddy> yeah
[04:51] <specialbuddy> and smbfs i think
[04:51] <dk0r> specialbuddy: yeah, dk0r ?
[04:51] <adaran> dk0r: you may want to take a loot at aptitude while you're at it
[04:51] <Maurox> vega__: it soun like a pluging problem or output problem
[04:51] <Maurox> sound**
[04:51] <specialbuddy> yeah dk0r
[04:51] <vega__> I think it must be a plugin problem, but I don't know what to do about it.
[04:51] <dk0r> adaran: 'sudo apt-get install aptitude' ??
[04:51] <adaran> vega__: yeah, that's what it does - it can't play a song, because it cannot use the soundcard - either it's busy or a configuration problem
[04:51] <vega__> The default linux media player doesn't work either.
[04:52] <adaran> dk0r: that'd be the first step =)
[04:52] <Flannel> dk0r: aptitude is already installed
[04:52] <vega__> Ok its the soundcard?
[04:52] <Maurox> get the plugings that you need
[04:52] <vega__> So I need to update my drivers for my card?
[04:52] <dk0r> Flannel: Oh. So how do I use it? 'sudo aptitude samba' ?
[04:52] <adaran> vega__: try getting alsa to work, aplay and such. there's tons of howtos for that. once you know that works, all you need to do is get the xine-engine to use alsa
[04:52] <Maurox> i think tht you need to configureit
[04:52] <Flannel> dk0r: aptitude can be used like apt get, or in an interactive GUI
[04:52] <Laibsc1> Anybody has an idea how to fix the mess that I am in after my edgy upgrade?  Further info at the support request I opened: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/2451
=== Laibsc1 is now known as Laibsch
[04:53] <dk0r> Flannel: So if I want Samba, I would enter 'sudo aptitude install samba' ?
[04:53] <adaran> dk0r: the main advantage of aptitude is NOT the gui, but the fact that it records "automatic" installs
[04:53] <Flannel> adaran: apt-get does too
[04:53] <dk0r> adaran: What do you 'records'? and what do you mean 'automatic' ?
[04:53] <adaran> Flannel: no, it doesn't
[04:53] <dk0r> What do you mean*
[04:53] <adaran> dk0r, Flannel: when you instal a package, dependencies (libs) get installed - consider a simplified example: installing "the gimp" needs "gtk"
[04:53] <ladydoor> !aptitude
[04:53] <ubotu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[04:53] <tritium> dk0r: if you uninstall a package, aptitude will remove the dependencies that only that package needed
[04:54] <dk0r> I dont want to use the gui. If i wanted a gui, I would use windows or osx. I dont want a gui. I want to learn terminal.
[04:54] <specialbuddy> apt-get install samba
[04:54] <Pelo> Adrian_, , sorry I can'T find the page with the instructions to update,  but trust me , many ppl have had major problem with the update-dist (me included)  you are better off backuping your home folder and installing from scratch
[04:54] <Maurox> i think that Flaneel says that he easyly can find what it is installed :P
[04:54] <dk0r> tritium: apt-get doesnt do that?
[04:54] <ladydoor> dk0r: aptitude actually has an ncurses "g"-ui...it's entirely terminal-based
[04:54] <Maurox> but apt-get do that too :P
[04:54] <Adrian_> Pelo: alright, sounds like a plan. Thanks
[04:54] <adaran> dk0r, Flannel: later, if you remove the gimp, only aptitude will notice that you did not REQUEST gtk, but only accepted it because another package needed it.
[04:54] <dk0r> adaran: and aptitude will remove gtk ?
[04:55] <tritium> dk0r: not unless it has been enhanced recently
[04:55] <ChocoCid> apt-get autoremove, problem solved
[04:55] <adaran> dk0r, Flannel: so that's my main selling point of aptitude. yes, aptitude will see that gtk is marked "automatic" and will check if any other package needs gtk. if not, gtk will be removed
[04:55] <Flannel> adaran: new versions of apt-get do that too.  Which is what I said.
[04:55] <ChocoCid> sudo apt-get install autoremove, then just use apt-get autoremove in the future :D
[04:55] <dk0r> adaran:
[04:55] <dk0r> adaran: Sounds smart. I like it.
[04:55] <dk0r> adaran: So same as apt-get? 'sudo aptitude install samba' ?
[04:56] <adaran> ChocoCid: so how does apt-get track what you want and what not?
[04:56] <ChocoCid> it doesn't, the program autoremove does
[04:56] <specialbuddy> dk0r, just sudo apt-get install samba
[04:56] <adaran> dk0r: yeah, works the same for basic tasks. and it works with apt-get, it's all the same package management
[04:56] <ivx> is there any good gpl video editing software?
[04:56] <lando__> ive been using liferea to read my feeds but was wondering if anyone here had any suggestions/experience with a better feed reader
[04:56] <CharlieSu> Has anyone setup encryption with Ubuntu and dm-crypt?
[04:57] <dk0r> specialbuddy: After all this talk, and the explanation of why aptitude is better, why do you recommend apt-get? Because samba comes with no dependencies?
[04:57] <dk0r> So it doesnt matter?
[04:57] <specialbuddy> just do apt-get
[04:57] <adaran> dk0r: if you install something with apt-get in the meantime, just all packages will be "requested", so even if you removed it with aptitude, they won't be uninstalled automatically. however, as others pointed out, maybe apt-get has seen some modernizations. i've been using aptitude for a while
[04:57] <specialbuddy> did you read the link I posted
[04:57] <lwizardl> iter: thanks
[04:57] <Pelo> ivx,  depends on what you want to do,  audacity seems to be the thing
[04:58] <iter> lwizardl: glad to help
[04:58] <specialbuddy> sudo apt-get install samba smbfs
[04:58] <dk0r> adaran: So does aptitude have the advantage you mentioned or not?
[04:58] <adaran> dk0r: bottom line: if you want to, you can substitute aptitude install for apt-get install almost anytime you want - with no drawbacks. on the other hand, your gain is just a few mb of harddrive space
[04:58] <specialbuddy> dk0r, enter that
[04:58] <ivx> pelo cool i'll check it out.
[04:58] <adaran> dk0r: yeah, i thought i made that clear.
[04:58] <ivx> thanks
[04:58] <CharlieSu> Has anyone setup encryption with Ubuntu and dm-crypt?
[04:58] <specialbuddy> just do what I just posted dk0r, no more talk just do the thing posted above
[04:58] <specialbuddy> sudo apt-get install samba smbfs
[04:58] <adaran> dk0r: however, while you're interested, don't take my word for it. read for yourself. or try it on a package with deps you don't have
[04:59] <jair> so guys to watch wmv and mpegs all I need to install is this?--> sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg?
[04:59] <jair> I am using dapper drake ubuntu
[04:59] <Pelo> ivx,  wait, sorry,  audacity is for audio , avidemux is for video
[04:59] <dk0r> adaran: Thank you for the explain.
[04:59] <adaran> dk0r: you're welcome
[04:59] <boris55> can someone tell me which repo has libxres1?
[04:59] <ivx> pelo oh well i'll look at both, thanks
[05:00] <Flannel> boris55: main
[05:00] <CharlieSu> Somebody please tell me why https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html#partman-crypto  Isn't on the Ubuntu CD like the documentation says it is..  Am I missing something?
[05:00] <dk0r> adaran: You familiar with getting mouse buttons working?
[05:00] <adaran> dk0r: mine usually work =)
[05:00] <lando__> ive been using liferea to read my feeds but was wondering if anyone here had any suggestions/experience with a better feed reader
[05:00] <Flannel> CharlieSu: have you asked the forums?  I know you've been asking here regularly and for a while.
[05:00] <adaran> dk0r: or do you mean "more then 3"? =)
[05:01] <CharlieSu> Flannel, yes.. Sorry..  I'm just trying to figure it out..  Nothing yet..
[05:01] <dk0r> adaran: yes. More than 3.
[05:01] <Flannel> CharlieSu: no need to be sorry, just trying to get it answered for you ;)
[05:01] <adaran> dk0r: nope. i don't use more then 3, even though i have a ridiculously overpriced mouse with more then 3
[05:01] <CharlieSu> Flannel, It is eating me up inside..  Usually I can figure things out myself..  This I just don't seem to be able to do..
[05:01] <CharlieSu> Flannel, do you use the Alternate CD when installing?
[05:02] <adaran> dk0r: you'll probably find a decent howto somewhere.
[05:02] <Flannel> CharlieSu: I do.  But, I haven't used it in a while.  Still on Breezy on my box.
[05:02] <CharlieSu> Flannel, why have you not upgraded?  preference?
[05:02] <adaran> dk0r: as always it's a pain in the ass to get anything working right with linux, however, you end up smarter at the end of the day - and the reverse wasn't better for me today, because my linux system worked while i spent over 10 hours trying to get windows installed
[05:03] <dk0r> adaran: I did. But its a dud.
[05:03] <dk0r> adaran: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-36653.html
[05:03] <Flannel> CharlieSu: no reason to, I have no GUI, and the packages I use have almost no new versions overall, so no real reason to.
[05:03] <secleinteer> hey, does anyone know if there's a packge i can install to get the planned edgy artwork that was dropped after the beta?
[05:03] <dk0r> adaran: Ive never spent 10 hours installing windows.
[05:03] <lindsayfl> i download nvidia drivers but it says i need to close X to install.  how do i close x in ubuntu without shutting down?  thx :)
[05:03] <CharlieSu> Flannel, well if you get bored please check into it for me..
[05:03] <adaran> dk0r: well do you know that local apic is?
[05:03] <adaran> dk0r: s/that/what/
[05:04] <Pelo> secleinteer,  have you tried looking for it on art-gnome
[05:04] <dk0r> adaran: huh?
[05:04] <dk0r> adaran: I'm interested if you would like to explain.
[05:04] <secleinteer> pelo: art-gnome?
[05:04] <secleinteer> is that a site?
[05:04] <adaran> dk0r: nothing special, i didn't know, too
[05:04] <Pelo> ;yeah
[05:04] <dk0r> lindsayfl: I dont think you cant restart X without restarting, can you ???
[05:04] <dk0r> adaran: Thats a nix thing, not windows? right?
=== ZeeEyes_ is now known as ZeeEyes
[05:04] <adaran> dk0r: it just took me 10 hours to find out, and get windows booting, after taking my new computer apart a couple of times
[05:04] <ladydoor> dk0r: control+alt+backspace
[05:04] <ayaa> mkisofs is saying: mkisofs: File '/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1/usb2/2-2/2-2:1.1/ep_82/bEndpointAddress' did shrink.
[05:04] <ayaa> what is this error ?
[05:04] <roycebarber> Anyone know which room George Fragos uses?
[05:04] <adaran> dk0r: no, it's a hardware standard for interrupts
[05:05] <ladydoor> dk0r: (that restarts X)
[05:05] <adaran> dk0r: os-indenpendant. currently i can't boot linux when it's on and can't boot windows when it's off
[05:05] <dk0r> adaran: An error code you mean ?
[05:05] <lindsayfl> the nvidia i run (sh NVIDIA) says i need to run without X
[05:05] <secleinteer> pelo: i can't find any ubuntu artwork there
[05:05] <juanW> hi i am new to ubuntu and linux and really like it a lot
[05:05] <dk0r> adaran: So its a bios setting?
[05:05] <adaran> dk0r: really, try wikipedia, if you want to know more. i was just explaining why i spent 10 hours installing windows
[05:05] <adaran> dk0r: well, yes, you could say that
[05:05] <Pelo> secleinteer,  not even on the ubuntu site ?
[05:05] <dk0r> ladydoor: you can restart x without restarting your whole machine?
[05:05] <adaran> dk0r: boils down to that, in the end
[05:05] <secleinteer> i'm talking about art-gnome
[05:05] <dk0r> adaran: whats it called again ?
[05:06] <dk0r> adaran: where do you edit/turn it on/off ?
[05:06] <Garota> que onda gente
[05:06] <adaran> dk0r: apic. try wikipedia
[05:06] <lindsayfl> tesm ctrl alt backspace to restart x
[05:06] <ladydoor> dk0r: yeah. i mean, i boot to a commandline, start X when i feel like it, and stop X when i feel like it...and start it again later, sometimes

[05:14] <adaran> no, didn't i just tell you i spent ten hours installign windows? :D
[05:14] <nomasteryoda> lol
[05:14] <nomasteryoda> ewwww
[05:14] <nomasteryoda> thats normal timeframe
[05:14] <dk0r> adaran: no. You said you have before. Not just.
[05:14] <nomasteryoda> now for the hacxor to ocme
[05:15] <adaran> oh, told you it's 5 am here
[05:15] <dk0r> adaran: What was the just of your apic problem.
[05:15] <adaran> i'm about to taste a few of the fruits of my labor
[05:15] <Crescendo_> How do I unmount an ISO?
[05:15] <dk0r> adaran: Were you getting blue screens?
[05:15] <adaran> dk0r: yeah, that's the 10 hours =)
[05:15] <nomasteryoda> Crescendo, umount /mnt/isofile
[05:15] <adaran> dk0r: one. install shield crashed on me badly when i kicked it
[05:15] <nomasteryoda> or whaeever you called it
[05:15] <dk0r> adaran: When you kicked it?
[05:16] <nomasteryoda> just cd out of it before or close nautilus if its open to it
[05:16] <ttttttt> You all have won $10,000 dollars email rickyfan34@hotmail.com.au with your details to claim it now, Good Luck.
[05:16] <adaran> dk0r: spammed the cancel button. that i have learned, never cancel an installation :P
[05:16] <iter> sweet! 10 grand!
[05:16] <nomasteryoda> nice
[05:16] <dk0r> adaran: And what are you talking about install shield? Doesnt windows have its own setup utility ?
[05:16] <Crescendo_> There's only one file in /mnt, and it isn't the right mounted ISO.
[05:16] <nomasteryoda> but first send us 1000
[05:16] <nomasteryoda> =D
[05:16] <nomasteryoda> haxors
[05:16] <adaran> oh dear. i feel like a kid in a candy store, cranking every graphical effects slider to the maximum =)
[05:16] <ttttttt> no sorry, send us your details first then we will send you the 10 grand
[05:16] <nomasteryoda> heeheheh
[05:17] <iter> ttttttt: can you just paypal it please ?
[05:17] <dk0r> adaran: INstallshield? Doesnt windows have its own setup utlity?
[05:17] <ChocoCid> windows's setup utility IS installshield
[05:17] <dk0r> ChocoCid: k.
[05:17] <nomasteryoda> no, i'll send you the IP of that korean outfit that claimed I scanned their ssh ports probing for root access
[05:17] <nomasteryoda> LOL
[05:17] <Crescendo_> umount: /media/ISO: device is busy
[05:17] <Crescendo_> umount: /media/ISO: device is busy
[05:17] <Crescendo_> What does that mean?
[05:17] <adaran> dk0r: yeah, the windows installer, the .msi files.
[05:17] <ChocoCid> the device is busy!
[05:17] <ChocoCid> </nothelpful>
[05:17] <Crescendo_> Urdur. :P
[05:17] <nomasteryoda> Crescendo, that you have something open to it
[05:17] <ChocoCid> probably still running a program based on it
[05:17] <iter> Crescendo_: you can use of to find out
[05:18] <nomasteryoda> like terminal
[05:18] <iter> Crescendo_: of = open file
[05:18] <dk0r> adaran: So what happened. It kept crashing during install so.. How did you determine the problem ?
[05:18] <adaran> dk0r: it's quite neat i think, give them a couple more years and they may have something that is a bit closer to apt
[05:18] <adaran> dk0r: oh, you meant the WINDOWS installation
[05:18] <adaran> dk0r: sorry.
[05:18] <dk0r> adaran: Isnt that what you are talking about?
[05:18] <adaran> dk0r: well i hung right after loading all the hardware drivers without a message
[05:18] <dk0r> adaran: Installing windows?
[05:18] <Crescendo_> I know there's a program running from it... kinda.  I'm running a 2 disc install from a mounted CD.
[05:18] <nomasteryoda> ah
[05:18] <iter> hmm not found, am I on crack ?
[05:18] <iter> ahh lsof
[05:18] <Crescendo_> I'm trying to switch to disc 2.
[05:19] <adaran> dk0r: well, i found your question a bit ambiguous, as you could've meant the "modern" software installer framework as well =)
[05:19] <dk0r> adaran: You said it took me 10 hours to install windows.
[05:19] <iter> Crescendo_: lsof | grep nameofiso
[05:19] <nomasteryoda> Crescendo, oh from mounted ISO files you did an install howso?
[05:19] <dk0r> adaran: that means you didnt get to the loading up drivers part.
[05:19] <nomasteryoda> lol
[05:20] <ixian_> anyone know how to configure the mousewheel in edgy? i want it to skip more lines of text when i move the mousewheel up or down.. how would i change that option? there doesnt seem to be anything in preferences > mouse..
[05:20] <Crescendo_> iter, it's again not returning the ISO that I mounted.
[05:20] <dk0r> adaran: anyways. So you got blue screens. What was the error ? It actually said blahblah apic ?
[05:20] <adaran> dk0r: the installer loads .sys files from the CD. it's the very first thing it does. that's "loading drivers"... loading kernel modules would be the linux equivalent
[05:20] <adaran> dk0r: it said nothing
[05:20] <nomasteryoda> dk0r, on a new box you can have windows up in about 2 hours... but it will be powned in about 2
[05:20] <dk0r> adaran: ohh. Those drivers!!!
[05:20] <dk0r> adaran: Ok. Im with you now. So all im interested in, is how you determined what the problem was.
[05:20] <adaran> dk0r: when i say it took me 10 hours, that means it took me hours to identify and narrow down the problem, taking out hardware, switching out components
[05:20] <Pelo> ixian_,   configuring mouse in linux is a text file editing job, go and search for it in the forum there are several tutorials there
[05:20] <nomasteryoda> Crescendo, mount will show what is mounted
[05:21] <nomasteryoda> just that command
[05:21] <iter> ixian_: it's in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:21] <Crescendo_> Got it.
[05:21] <nomasteryoda> "mount"
[05:21] <nomasteryoda> k
[05:21] <Crescendo_> /home/eric/Media/Software/Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries/MW4_CD1.ISO on /media/ISO type iso9660 (rw,loop=/dev/loop0)
[05:21] <dk0r> adaran: And. How did you identify problem? Setup crashed to error message? or black?
[05:21] <adaran> dk0r: hm first i found out that hardware recognition is done at the step it hangs, so i blamed the hardware (naturally) - took out everything - including the hd - so i only had gfx card, mainboard, cpu, ram and dvd rom in there
[05:21] <Crescendo_> umount /media/ISO ?
[05:21] <Crescendo_> That doesn't work.
[05:21] <adaran> dk0r: no, it just hung. only indication was at which point it hung. so i went from there
[05:22] <Crescendo_> Or is it umount /home/eric/.........?
[05:22] <iter> Crescendo_: umout /home/eric/Media/etc/etce/tece/wer//asdf
[05:22] <Crescendo_> Alright.
[05:22] <Crescendo_> :)
[05:22] <adaran> dk0r: first i suspected bad ram, bad cd, bad gfx card, had to test all those things, which takes time (downloading isos, running memtest, etc)
[05:22] <nomasteryoda> Crescendo, i have seen some modes for games where you had to make a special "ini" file and tell it where the other discs were
[05:22] <dk0r> I hate waiting for memtest.
[05:22] <nomasteryoda> to do such an install
[05:22] <nomasteryoda> where was that ....
[05:22] <dk0r> adaran: where did you get your install?
[05:22] <adaran> dk0r: trust me, that was the easiest part.
[05:22] <nomasteryoda>  hey, google  do you know?
[05:22] <Crescendo_> sudo umount /home/eric/Media/Software/Mechwarrior\ 4\:\ Mercenaries/MW4_CD1.ISO
[05:22] <Crescendo_> umount: /media/ISO: device is busy
[05:22] <Crescendo_> :/
[05:22] <dk0r> adaran: Whered you get your install?
[05:22] <adaran> dk0r: get my install? the cd? it's an iso microsoft offers
[05:23] <bilange> how (with which program) the audio part is handled in ubuntu edgy? for some reason, I cant seem to playback more than one stream at a time on ubuntu; windows playbacks more than one.. as much as I would in fact.
[05:23] <nomasteryoda> Crescendo, your installer is still accessing the iso mount point
[05:23] <dk0r> adaran: ms offers an xp iso? for download? where?
[05:23] <Crescendo_> Yes it is - if I terminate it, there goes the install.
[05:23] <nomasteryoda> right
[05:23] <nomasteryoda> hence my comment
[05:23] <adaran> dk0r: it's available if you're studying at the university where i am studying
[05:23] <dk0r> adaran: oh ok. so its legit. no one goofed it up.
[05:23] <Crescendo_> Hrm.
[05:23] <dk0r> adaran: continue.
[05:23] <adaran> dk0r: you get a lot of stuff, except office. mainly visual studio, windows, sql server - all stuff that would be "interesting" to cs students
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> you know you can set up multiple "CD drives" with wine
[05:24] <daftvader> hi i need some help
[05:24] <Crescendo_> Hrm, that'd help.
[05:24] <daftvader> i just suddenly lost access to my windows partition
[05:24] <Crescendo_> I was thinking Wine was complicating it.
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> i think the installer might know where to find them
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> hangon
[05:24] <Crescendo_> Alright.
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> oh, for sure
=== Crescendo_ is now known as Crescendo
[05:24] <dk0r> So what happened. You updated bios?
[05:24] <dk0r> Or found bad hardware?
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> i love my new heat-sync for my lappy...
[05:24] <adaran> dk0r: not sure what else there is to say. as i spent quite a lot of time on this, even managed to bruise my finger in a drawer pretty badly, i'd rather end this here and play for a while, if you're okay with that :P
[05:25] <nomasteryoda> solid panel of 1/2 inch aluminum
[05:25] <redDEADresolve> Im am trying to install Edy Eft, Ubuntu 6.10 on my new Dell laptop. Everything loads up and goes smoothy until it asks me to manually partition the hard drive. Edgy does not "see" my hard drive. I just have a bank list ANY IDEAS?
[05:25] <dk0r> adaran: ok? weirdo.
[05:25] <adaran> dk0r: right
[05:25] <dk0r> adaran: left
[05:25] <nomasteryoda> redDEADresolve, yes... download the live CD of gparted...
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> use that to partition... then try again
[05:26] <redDEADresolve> i got gparted alrerady
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> that worked on a brand new dell with sata drives for me
[05:26] <redDEADresolve> what do i do?
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> k
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> you booted and partitioned with it?
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> not the ubuntu version, but "real" thing
[05:27] <redDEADresolve> no, i havent i will. my win xp parition works fine. should i reformat it in ex3?
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> Crescendo, try this...
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> What works
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> Install but i needed to make a folder with the files contained in the two cds. No problems during install.
[05:27] <Pelo> g'night folks
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> was on the wine HP app db
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> no
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> redDEADresolve, nope
[05:28] <caveMan> hi. i just wondering where to install google-earth. if I try to install it as normal user it attempts to install at home directory, that doesn't seem like a good practice. if i try to install it as root it defaults to /opt/google-earth. is there any convention to follow for this or should I just install it wherever?
[05:28] <Crescendo> Hrm, I'll give that a shot.
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> i recommend making the partiton for linux ext3 and a swap
[05:28] <Crescendo> I'm messing with wine's drive mapping right now
[05:28] <redDEADresolve> i have real gparted cd what do you want me to do
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> but keep windows first on the drive
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> what i justt said
[05:29] <nomasteryoda> should work perfectly, but ymmv
[05:29] <redDEADresolve> masteryoda what if i dont want a windows partition?
[05:29] <nomasteryoda> ok
[05:29] <redDEADresolve> and whats ymmv?
[05:29] <caffiendo> how do I untar a file so it extacts the subdirectories and keeps the permissions?
[05:29] <radioaktivstorm> how do i get ubuntu to use a swap partition on my hdd?
[05:29] <nomasteryoda> your mileage may vary
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> !swap
[05:30] <ubotu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[05:30] <redDEADresolve> whats that mean? im sorry not a good english speaker
[05:30] <Roman_Logix> has anyone been able to get ati radeon all in wonder cards to show TV and capture? An easy task in windows, not so much for me... kinda a newbie.
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> ok
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> redDEADresolve, not a problem
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> you want no windows
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> ok
[05:30] <redDEADresolve> so everything in exe3 and i should load up huh?
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> if gparted boots ok, wipe the drive
[05:30] <Madhouze> hey all
[05:31] <nomasteryoda> into 3 partitions redDEADresolve
[05:31] <Madhouze> i have 2 problems which i am not sure if they are connected:
[05:31] <nomasteryoda> '/ for root /home and swap
[05:31] <tritium> !enter
[05:31] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[05:31] <Madhouze> 1. when i start my ubuntu, i get a "home" window opened automatically but no frames or title bars and ni keyboard shortcut is working
[05:32] <Madhouze> also i cannot add any program to my session start up- once i restart whatever i added gets deleted.
[05:32] <Crescendo> I'm trying to umount, and it still won't umount - wine is killed, not running.
[05:32] <Crescendo> :/
[05:33] <redDEADresolve> its loading, so ill wipe it and reinstall into 3 partitions.  thanks hopefully it will work
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> but is necessary for those who do not speak good English... from time to time. But that is my choice. I could | everthing toghether into runonwords andmakeithardtoreadorjust be niceandbreakup
[05:33] <Madhouze> 2. whenever i try to run a program or a game at full screen my Xserver dies!!! monitor goes off and all, i can still change to other VTs... but cant do a thing with VT7
[05:33] <Madhouze> can anybody help me?
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> shorter phrases are better and space is the same in the logs except for one extra enter for each line.
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> Madhouze, hang on..
[05:33] <Madhouze> i will
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> what is the card type you have
[05:34] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda, me?
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> i'll try until someone else picks up the shield
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> yes
[05:34] <nomasteryoda> you Madhouze
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> domo arigato mister_roboto
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> =D heheh
[05:35] <mister_roboto> nomasteryoda: ;)
[05:35] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda, i have a XFX Geforce 6200
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> good madc
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> er, Madhouze
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> !nvidia
[05:36] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:36] <Madhouze> i have nvidia drivers installed
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> ah
[05:36] <Madhouze> tried to uninstall and reinstall, but did not change a thing
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> then that is the issue at hand...
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> did you put in the "nvidia" as the type into the xorg.conf file?
[05:36] <Madhouze> yep
[05:37] <Madhouze> and i get the cool nvidia screen when linux is loading...
[05:38] <radioaktivstorm> how would i use the swap partition on the HDD as opposed tto creating a swap file?
[05:38] <dk0r> Help. dk0r@ubuntu:~$ screen -list
[05:38] <Madhouze> any idea nomasteryoda ?
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> Madhouze, is this a new install or existing?... i.e. did a home partition exist before you started?
[05:38] <dk0r> I dont think screen is working
[05:38] <dk0r> dk0r@ubuntu:~$ screen -list
[05:38] <dk0r> No Sockets found in /var/run/screen/S-dk0r.
[05:39] <SilentDis> hello :)
[05:39] <nomasteryoda> radioaktivstorm, you need to determine what the UUDI for that partiton is
[05:39] <Madhouze> well- i am dual booting with vista... but since my ubuntu crashed after i upgraded from dapper to edgy, this is a fresh installation...
[05:39] <nomasteryoda> ah ok... good
[05:39] <radioaktivstorm> nomasteryoda, how do i find this?
[05:39] <lzmmzl> hello
[05:39] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda, but it WAS working fine until recently... that is- the full screen and frames issue did not exist - although i could not add any new programs to my session start up from the start.
[05:40] <nomasteryoda> ah, did you let a new kernel install?
[05:40] <Madhouze> hm.... yes.
[05:40] <Madhouze> i see now that this could actually have been when problems started....
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> then you most certainly will need to regen the nvidia binaries..
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> try dropping down to the kernel below in grub
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> just one level and see if it still exisits
[05:41] <Madhouze> i will... let me try. i'll be back shortly.
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> k
[05:41] <roycebarber> anyone in here connected to art.ubuntu.com youre on my anger list for making the site so slow
[05:41] <Madhouze> thank you so much nomasteryoda !
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> np
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> lol
[05:42] <nomasteryoda> it is always that slow roycebarber ... imho
[05:42] <nomasteryoda> too much art
[05:42] <SilentDis> question:  I'm thinking of going to Edgy (currently on Dapper).  I'd probably do a fresh install.  my /home is on a seperate partition.  would i need to delete anything from my current profile, and would it 'carry over' properly (no weird permissions issues, for example)
[05:42] <nomasteryoda> SilenceGold, is this a "production box"
[05:43] <nomasteryoda> as in you use it daily?
[05:44] <nomasteryoda> and rely on it?.... or significant other uses it.. i really want to move over, but edgy is edgy on some boxes... recommend renaming old profile folder then making new one with new install
[05:44] <roycebarber> other than the CRAPPY art.ubuntu.com, is there a place where i can post mock up images of future ubuntu versions
[05:44] <nomasteryoda> i.e. the '/home/user1 should become user2 to be safe
[05:44] <SilentDis> nomasteryoda:  i assume you're refering to me, SilentDis?  *giggle*  yes, it's my main 'puter.
[05:44] <bilange> SilentDis, I did this kind of migration from Breezy to Dapper, and worked okay (no permission issues), but I dont know about Edgy... YMMV, and id backup your vital stuff just in case.
[05:44] <nomasteryoda> oops
[05:45] <nomasteryoda> yes ... the only thing about home... you should start fresh to get newer gnome stuff
[05:45] <redDEADresolve> nomateryoda edgy still will not recognize my hard drive
[05:45] <AsheD> how does one play a DVD in Ubuntu?
[05:45] <nomasteryoda> redDEADresolve, then the boot loader of of that disk is your issue...
[05:45] <roycebarber> bah..technology... *whips out a pen and pad of paper*. i need no technology. *lights go out*. shoot.
[05:45] <Maurox> opening the dvd room :P
[05:46] <bimberi> !dvd | AsheD
[05:46] <ubotu> AsheD: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html  -  libdvdcss can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[05:46] <nomasteryoda> get the alternate cd redDEADresolve and try it instead I have seen issues with that too. They are documented in the forums
[05:46] <SilentDis> nomasteryoda:  ahhh, ok.  so boot from the live edgy cd, mount /dev/hdb3, rename the home folder with my old stuff, install, then migrate my files back?
[05:46] <Crescendo> How do I activate a second video card in Edgy?  I installed the card on a PCI slot, and have a monitor connected. lspc returns an unknown device, but no video card.
[05:46] <nomasteryoda> yu gout it
[05:46] <nomasteryoda> got it
[05:46] <SilentDis> !dvd | AsheD
[05:46] <ubotu> AsheD: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html  -  libdvdcss can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[05:47] <radioaktivstorm> nomasteryoda, how would i mount the swap partition now that ive found the UUDI?
[05:47] <nomasteryoda> oh good...
[05:47] <nomasteryoda> radioaktivstorm, try "man swapon"
[05:47] <CharlieSu> Has anyone used encryption via this method?  I think documentation is messed up for Ubuntu.  https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html#partman-crypto
[05:47] <shayan_> hey, does anyone know a kill command for conky? like  " kill conky" or something like that?
[05:48] <SilentDis> another option i have is to backup everything to my ximeta net disk... but i hear they don't quite work yet in edgy.  that's the big sticking point as to why i've not upgraded yet :P
[05:48] <nomasteryoda> if it mounts ok, then edit your /etc/fstab and add the line needed
[05:48] <bilange> actually, for DVD playback, I would let automatix do the trick. I just put a CD in and Totem popped up automaticly.. thanks to automatix. Installing by hand would cause more harm IMO
[05:48] <bimberi> shayan_: 'killall conky' if conky is the command that the process is running
[05:48] <nomasteryoda> SilentDis, if its in a separate partition, just make new folder called backup and move into it
[05:49] <SilentDis> shayan_:  you can do a ps -A | grep -i conky... or use killall
[05:49] <Madhouze> hey nomasteryoda... im back, and bearing bad news- it didnt help
[05:49] <nomasteryoda> radioaktivstorm, as example my line for swap is... "UUID=a77dc04c-7b7e-4251-9dc6-93e5e604d9d6 none swap sw 0 0"
[05:50] <nomasteryoda> man Madhouze thats not good news
[05:50] <SilentDis> nomasteryoda:  the net disk is a weirdo little drive I picked up a while back.  it's like a USB HD, but connects via ethernet.  it doesn't use NAS, rather, their own particular thing called NDAS.  i got the driver working in dapper at least
[05:50] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda, actually- this is the thing- i now get the frame and title bar and all- it happened the last time i rebooted too, but not before... i think that for some reason metacity was not being loaded at startup
[05:50] <JasonMog-sad> cant a file belong to more than one group?
[05:51] <SilentDis> nomasteryoda:  had to compile from source, iirc :P
[05:51] <nomasteryoda> ah
[05:51] <nomasteryoda> wow
[05:51] <radioaktivstorm> nomasteryoda, that's located in the /etc/fstab...its in there, but ubuntu isnt using it at all
[05:51] <Madhouze> but still- i cant run vid/games full screen- it kills my session.... the screen just goes black and then turns off... i can still switch to other VTs tho...
[05:52] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda, seems like you are very popular....
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> ok, radioaktivstorm if it was formatted as swap then it should be able to with the swapon command as outlined in man swapon
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> Madhouze, just the only one answering tonight
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> =D
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> thanks
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> and that will end shortly.. 12am
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> sleep comes soon
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> so Madhouze did you try to enable beryl?
[05:52] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda, is there anything else you can think of?
[05:52] <Madhouze> yes.
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> ah
[05:53] <SilentDis> nomasteryoda:  you are better versed than I is all.  i help where i can ;)
[05:53] <nomasteryoda> thats the issue ... i could not get that working with my nvidia based dell
[05:53] <Madhouze> actually - before when i did not get the frames and bars, the only way i got passed it was loading the beryl-manager....
[05:53] <nomasteryoda> ya
[05:53] <caveMan> can I restart X without quiting xchat?
[05:54] <Madhouze> really? for me beryl worked right off after the ap-tget...
[05:54] <nomasteryoda> Madhouze, see if emerald is loaded.... ps ax |grep emerald
[05:54] <Madhouze> it is
[05:54] <jair> hey guys, it is ok if I enable all the repositories on my xubuntu?
[05:54] <Ecko2056> how can i use apt-cache to search whats installed already? not whats available ..
[05:54] <nomasteryoda> caveMan, er not unless you had it going as another tty like tty9
[05:54] <nomasteryoda> Madhouze, then try killall -9 emerald
[05:55] <SilentDis> jair:  it won't HURT, but you'll get a lot of non-free libraries in there.  if you're working on the machine from a school, might be best to leave it be, just so you don't end up in legal troubles :P
[05:55] <Madhouze> says: no process killed
[05:55] <jair> the thing is that I selected all the different repositories.
[05:55] <nomasteryoda> sudo
[05:55] <Madhouze> oh, i should probably root that..
[05:55] <Madhouze> .hehe
[05:55] <caveMan> nomasteryoda, how do I have it in another tty, I'm messing around with X but have to quit irc on each restart
[05:55] <nomasteryoda> =D
[05:55] <jair> SilentDis: ohh ok but I am using it strictly personal, at home :)
[05:55] <Madhouze> still says "emerald: no process killed"
[05:56] <SilentDis> jair:  then you should be OK, for the most part :)
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> caveMan, the other option is "ctrl+alt+F1" then login as your username, using issri (i think that is the name)
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> ctrlaltF7 to get back
[05:56] <jair> SilentDis: other thing really quick, this version of Debian normally does everything from a gui? can i also do my installations using apt-get ?
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> jair, yes
[05:57] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda, hmph... any other ideas?
[05:57] <caveMan> I see
[05:57] <nomasteryoda> looking
[05:57] <jair> SilentDis: what i am trying to find is the right codecs to watch my dvds and couple of slipknot videos :)
[05:57] <Centaur5> How can I make the syslog file stop reporting to the terminal?
[05:57] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda,  what about the fact that i cannot change or add programs from my session startup?
[05:57] <jair> nomasteryoda: I see
[05:57] <nomasteryoda> caveMan, you can also click the "exit" or power off button and choose switch user
[05:57] <n0dl> i have a probelm. sudo tells me that it is unable to lookup localhost via gethostname()
[05:58] <n0dl> how can i fix this?
[05:58] <n0dl> i cant reboot without sudo
[05:58] <jair> nomasteryoda: so everything else should work the same as sarge? or etch? apt-get cache policy dpkg-l etc..
[05:58] <nomasteryoda> Madhouze, if the session crashed, then a locked file might exisit too in your ~/ folder
[05:58] <bimberi> n0dl: reboot into recovery mode and make sure /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname have the same hostname
[05:58] <radioaktivstorm> nomasteryoda, terminal returns 'invalid argument' when i try swapon according to the mans
[05:58] <Madhouze> nomasteryoda,  and then?
[05:58] <Ecko2056> how can i use apt-cache to search whats installed already? not whats available ..
[05:58] <nomasteryoda> jair, but use the ubuntu repos to stay "true " to ubuntu
[05:59] <nomasteryoda> Ecko2056, hang on
[05:59] <n0dl> bimberi: i cant reboot
[05:59] <bimberi> Ecko2056: dpkg -l | grep ^ii    will tell you what's installed
[05:59] <nomasteryoda> man apt-cache
[05:59] <rycardyx> Alguem conhece um programa pra gravao de cd, sem ser o k3b?
[05:59] <nomasteryoda> that works thanks bimberi
[05:59] <Ecko2056> thank you
[05:59] <bimberi> n0dl: no physical access
[05:59] <bimberi> ?

[06:04] <tonyyarusso> What's a good curses-type CD player frontend for cli playing?

[06:06] <KDan> after editing /etc/crontab, how do i tell cron to reload that system crontab?
[06:06] <bimberi> radioaktivstorm: i'm not sure sorry

[06:07] <radioaktivstorm> bimberi, its cool, thanks

[06:13] <jair> bimberi: it is not in the list, but I check the 800x600 and was bigger than the one I am and on the "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" appears 1024x768 default.

[06:23] <CPrgmSwR2> And gyach?
[06:24] <Daylighter> beryl is wonderful, I'll rejoice more when 1.0 comes out
[06:24] <Flannel> shayan_: unused ram is wasted ram.  Linux loads lots of stuff into memory, to use it quickly.  It'll manage it if you actually need that for other stuff, etc.
[06:24] <CPrgmSwR2> I already have beryl in gentoo

[06:54] <boodzut> my load average 0.67 to :D not even 1%
[06:54] <boodzut> <3 ubuntu
[06:54] <ixian_> anyone know of a good tutorial for installing tor on edgy?
[06:54] <Chi_0> yeah i know but im running a notebook :(
[06:55] <Chi_0> i only had this problem switching to edgy
[06:56] <tom47> ixian i was even more paranoid with tor running on my desktop than without it lol
[06:56] <tom47> took it off again
[06:57] <totall_6_7> !tor
[06:57] <ubotu> tor: anonymizing overlay network for TCP. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.1.1.23-1 (edgy), package size 763 kB, installed size 1556 kB
[06:57] <boodzut> and im running apache, ftp, ssh , and a 2 slot game server
[06:57] <boodzut> I ment linux so good on resources and im running all that above and its not even 1%
[06:57] <boodzut> cpu usage
[06:58] <jordo23> Does anyone know how to setup TeamSpeak on Ubuntu?
[06:58] <boodzut> its at 0.34
[06:58] <boodzut> :D
[06:58] <tom47> boodzut wait until you have signed up a million users
[06:58] <boodzut> yeah
[06:58] <Maurox> <jordo23> just intsall
[06:58] <Maurox> install *
[06:58] <boodzut> but for a 2 slot game server its doing good to be under 1%
[06:58] <tom47> !teamspeak
[06:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about teamspeak - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:58] <boodzut> thats always changing maps and stuff
[06:58] <tom47> ok
[06:59] <specialbuddy> is there a way to force chmod on an external harddrive?
[06:59] <jordo23> tom4: have you set this up?
[06:59] <tom47> specialbuddy i believe its safer to establish a folder on it and then chown that
[07:00] <specialbuddy> yeah but I can't change the permissions at all for the drives
[07:02] <tom47> try putting a folder on it and changing perms on hat speialbuddy
=== sudharsh_ is now known as Sup3rkiddo
[07:03] <specialbuddy> that didn't work tom47
[07:03] <specialbuddy> I can't change any of the permissions
[07:04] <specialbuddy> what should I go with if I'm using the hard drive just for storage, fat or ext?
[07:05] <tom47> specialbuddy my feeling is fat32 gives you greater flexibility should you want access on another co,puter at some time
[07:05] <Lam_> i'm assuming i can't force apt-get to install a package without having its dependency check
[07:05] <roycebarber> anyone know if WinFS (whenever the schmook it comes out) will be available for Ubuntu?
[07:06] <Lathiat> roycebarber: erm, didnt microsoft scrap that?
[07:06] <foo> How can I add a network printer? What's the command line tool again? cups ?
[07:06] <nofxx_> How can I control my notebook cpu fan speed ?!  it is starting when the proc reaches 60C...
[07:06] <tom47> foo i use the gui
[07:06] <foo> tom47: yes, what is the CLI? Hm
[07:06] <foo> option, that is
[07:06] <roycebarber> MS delayed WinFS but i highly doubt they scrapped it.
[07:06] <specialbuddy> is there any other drawbacks to using fat or ext tom47?
[07:07] <nofxx_> i have lmsensors working, but no rpm infos.. just temps....
[07:07] <tom47> specialbuddy it depends on your politics largely i think
[07:07] <specialbuddy> ok...
[07:07] <Axs> i have an ipw2200 network driver, after running command "iwconfig eth0 mode monitor" it immediately reverts back to managed mode, it hink it has something to do with not being to be on monitor mode when connected to a network?
[07:07] <tom47> ext is a better fs but fat32 gives you a broader range of places you can use the drive
[07:07] <ademan_> !xvidcap
[07:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xvidcap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:07] <specialbuddy> better fs?
[07:08] <tom47> file system
[07:08] <specialbuddy> is that important?
[07:08] <tom47> !ext3
[07:08] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[07:09] <ademan_> ext3 blows fat32 out of the water, and i dare say ntfs also
[07:09] <ademan_> fat32 however is read natively by just about every OS i can think of
[07:09] <ademan_> so that's an advantage
[07:09] <specialbuddy> is ext3 read by mac?
[07:09] <ademan_> specialbuddy: pretty sure it is
[07:10] <ademan_> my friend was doing it, dunno if he did anything special
[07:10] <specialbuddy> well I have a ext2 partition on this portable hard drive and I can't change the permissions
[07:10] <ademan_> what's the "best" way to capture your x server's output? like, your screen? as a video?

[07:12] <ademan_> specialbuddy: so chmod whever_the_mount_point_is   says what?
[07:13] <specialbuddy> ademan_ is the mount point in /media

[07:13] <Axs> how do i force a wlan card to stay in monitor mode and not connect to any wireless networks?
[07:13] <ademan_> probably
[07:13] <JSeligstein> Hey guys, I can't seem to find a dyndns client in ubuntu's packages... can anyone help ?
[07:13] <ademan_> JSeligstein: there's a php based one you have to add to a cron job
[07:13] <fiyawerx> JSeligstein: does your router support it? i find that a pretty easy option :)

[07:14] <oxez> hi, I just installed Edgy, and I have a small issue.. It detects my soundcard as a VIA one, (AC97).. this is my onboard soundcard, which I never used. I have a SoundBlaster Live! 5.1 (emu10k1). How would I select it as my default soundcard?

[07:14] <oxez> Lathiat, I did. It doesn't show up there.
[07:14] <ademan_> specialbuddy: what happens though?
[07:15] <JSeligstein> ademan_: ddclient not found
[07:15] <specialbuddy> nothing
[07:15] <Lathiat> oxez: hrm, weird, it should
[07:15] <ademan_> JSeligstein: did you add the universe repository?
[07:15] <Lathiat> oxez: even on the default bit of the 'system sounds' tab?
[07:15] <ademan_> specialbuddy: no error code or anything?
[07:15] <Lathiat> oxez: does lsmod|grep emu10k1 show anything?
[07:15] <specialbuddy> chmod u+r /media/usbdisk-1
[07:15] <JSeligstein> ademan_: probably not? how?
[07:15] <oxez> Lathiat, negative.. weird.
[07:15] <ademan_> JSeligstein: open up synaptic
[07:15] <oxez> Lathiat, wait, yes they're there. My bad.
[07:16] <ademan_> settings->repositories
[07:16] <specialbuddy> drwx------ ademan_
[07:16] <oxez> Lathiat, I used grep emu10l1 instead of 'k', but yea they're in lsmod. I can't seem to find why gnome would not show it in it's list..
[07:16] <ademan_> specialbuddy: try doing it as root (sudo chmod u+r etc )
[07:16] <specialbuddy> I am root
[07:16] <ademan_> strange
[07:16] <ademan_> so there's no error?
[07:17] <specialbuddy> no
[07:17] <JSeligstein> ademan_: there are a lot checked and unchecked
[07:17] <Lathiat> oxez: hrm not sure sorry
[07:17] <specialbuddy> I can change the partition that is fat though
[07:17] <Lathiat> oxez: try disabling the onboard sound in your bios perhaps?
[07:17] <ademan_> JSeligstein: one of the checkboxes says Community maintained blah blah blah (universe)   enable that one
[07:17] <oxez> Lathiat, I will. That's weird because it works great on Gentoo, FreeBSD and Windows.
[07:18] <oxez> Having to play in my bios to get it work on Ubuntu is lame, really.
[07:18] <webhed> Hey all. I have a question. I just installed Beryl and everything seems to work but my previous Gnome themes don't seem to work anymore, specifically the 'controls' look like old-fashioned Gnome, ie, square buttons and everything. Does anyone know what I am talking about? I'm probably not terribly clear.
[07:18] <ademan_> webhed: go to system->preferences->theme and see if you can change it to something else
[07:18] <webhed> I did and can't
[07:18] <webhed> Ademan
[07:18] <ademan_> :-/

[07:19] <oxez> Lathiat, lspci shows up: 00:0c.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 0a)
[07:19] <ademan_> i never had that problem with beryl, the only thing that happened to me was i lost all my metacity themes (which of course makes sense since beryl replaces metacity)
[07:19] <webhed> maybe thats what happened to me? What specifically are Metacity themes?
[07:19] <ademan_> metacity is the window manager
[07:19] <JSeligstein> ademan_: cool, it seemed to install and auto configure... lets see if it works ;)
[07:19] <ademan_> metacity themes are the window borders
[07:20] <specialbuddy> ademan_ do you think it has something to do with it being a hotplug device
[07:20] <webhed> And how do I make, using Beryl, the controls and such (borders, buttons, scroll bars etc) look nicer?
[07:20] <JSeligstein> Thanks
[07:20] <ademan_> specialbuddy: not if the fat partition is on the same drive
[07:20] <webhed> Are there Beryl themes you can download and install?
[07:20] <specialbuddy> ademan_ well maybe I should just go all fat32 then
[07:20] <ademan_> webhed: as far as the borders go to system->preferences->emerald theme manager   there are several themes available on http://beryl-project.org
[07:20] <webhed> Or is Beryl just the window borders?
[07:21] <ademan_> webhed: beryl just does window borders (well technically its emerald, but thats a part of beryl)
[07:21] <webhed> ok yes I can do that. I am able to change the Window borders, but thats not the problem, its everything inside of the borders.
[07:21] <ademan_> yeah
[07:21] <ademan_> i dunno what the deal is there
[07:21] <webhed> Emerald lets me change those no problem.
[07:22] <ademan_> yeah
[07:22] <ademan_> but as far as widgets (ie: controls) i dunno
[07:22] <webhed> ok

[07:23] <ademan_> are you sure you have composite enabled in your x server?
[07:23] <webhed> how can I check?

[07:28] <ademan_> there's a small possibility things will go wrong, in which case you'll sudo nano /etx/X11/xorg.conf and remove the things i told you to add

[07:33] <webhed> And will this just fix the problem I described or will it give other things as well?
[07:34] <BadKitty> Gexo, are you trying to connect to a known network?
[07:34] <ademan_> webhed: it should hopefully fix the problems you described, but i'm not promising anything, and if it causes a crash at boot, you'll get dumped at a virtual console and you'll login and do "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and remove the changes we made  and then "sudo shutdown -r now"
[07:34] <Gexo> yes
[07:34] <webhed> gotcha - thanks ademan and I won't hold you responsible for anything but will give you credit if I'm good. Thanks for the assist :)
[07:34] <Gexo> actually, i was also hopping to view all available networks

[08:02] <Dravere_Tyrulian> how to i do that
[08:03] <ixian_> go into synaptic and search for flashplayer-mozilla
[08:03] <ixian_> or just do sudo apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla
[08:04] <me__> does my /home contain all of my ubuntu settings and OS stuff?
[08:04] <l337> Can anyone help me for a second
[08:04] <l337> I'm at the last step up installing Beryl
[08:04] <Rob125> me: AFAIK, just program settings, rather than OS settings

[08:05] <l337> beryl
[08:05] <l337> emerald
[08:05] <l337> where do i add beryl & emerald at the bottom
[08:05] <l337> sorry
[08:05] <l337> just wondering where to add those last 2 lines described
[08:05] <l337> very confused as to where to add them
[08:05] <ixian_> what guide are you following
[08:06] <l337> ubuntuguide.org beryl (ati)
[08:06] <Lovloss> how come i cannot extract .rar files?
[08:06] <Dravere_Tyrulian> YAY
[08:06] <Dravere_Tyrulian> now i just need to do the AOss
[08:06] <l337> I created the new xgl sessions
[08:06] <Dravere_Tyrulian> thign
[08:06] <grndslm> can i use beryl with intel or nvidia??
[08:06] <l337> and it said to add a new sessions which i did
[08:06] <Lovloss> it says it doesnt support that format
[08:06] <l337> then it just said add and listed beryl & emerald
[08:07] <l337> not sure where 2 add them
[08:07] <Rob125> Beryl (good) install guide: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu
[08:07] <ixian_> l337, read below that
[08:07] <Lovloss> !rar
[08:07] <ubotu> rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[08:07] <ixian_> l337, "to gnome session startup programs. ( go to system , preferences , sessions and select the startup programs tab )"
[08:07] <Lovloss> ah
[08:07] <ixian_> thats where you add beryl and emerald
[08:08] <whiteandnerdy> I can't get nfsd to run -- it comes up this message: Cannot register service: RPC: Unable to send; errno = Operation not permitted
[08:08] <l337> where do i browse to find these apps
[08:08] <l337> ?
[08:08] <l337> or what is the startup cmd
[08:08] <whiteandnerdy> I have run it with sudo (sudo rpc.nfsd) and under a root shell (sudo -s)
[08:08] <Dravere_Tyrulian> .. Can anyone remind me how to put sound back on my flash in firefox
[08:08] <whiteandnerdy> Dravere_Tyrulian, check the Wiki:

[08:09] <whiteandnerdy> I have read the NFS-HOWTO at TLDP but found it fairly outdated, with no sections on the nfs-user-server nor 2.6 kernels.
[08:09] <Keyseir> I get an x error whenever I run kde applications (i've had this with kate and kdevelop so far). It opens up but the window closes when I click a menu. http://pastebin.com/824784
[08:09] <whiteandnerdy> Also the HOWTO didn't cover RPC errors
[08:10] <l337> ixian, i am at that screen
[08:10] <l337> but it just says add beryl & emerald
[08:10] <l337> what are the cmds or where do i browse to find them
[08:10] <l337> it doesnt list that info in the guide =O
[08:11] <Keyseir> Any ideas folks?
[08:11] <beasty> on what ?
[08:11] <Keyseir> My previous question
[08:11] <ixian_> click on 'applications' or whatever.. i cant remember what the default desktop looks like.. :\
[08:11] <ixian_> do you see 'system' or 'applications'.. something similar.. at the top of yoru screen?
[08:11] <beasty> neither can i :s
[08:11] <Rob125> 1337: you're at the 'startup programs' tab in 'sessions' right?
[08:11] <l337> yes ROB
[08:11] <whiteandnerdy> Is there a more updated NFS-HOWTO, or an RPC troubleshooting guide?
[08:12] <ixian_> oh ok
[08:12] <Rob125> add 'beryl-manager' and 'beryl-xgl'
[08:12] <mooey> Keyseir, dodgy input devices in your xorg.conf maybe?
[08:12] <Rob125> ... at least, that's what I have.
[08:12] <Halpo> anyone in here have an All-In-Wonder card/use GATOS??
[08:12] <Keyseir> mooey: Would you take a look at that if I pastebinned it?
[08:12] <ixian_> two separate entries, not in the same one ;)
[08:12] <pravin> help i'm having DNS issues.
[08:12] <glick> i dont like the fact that fiesty will have 3d desktop set as the default
[08:12] <glick> i dont get why they would do that
[08:13] <mooey> Keyseir, i'm not sure it would help. i'm only making guesses at where to start looking for the cause of the problem.
[08:13] <mooey> Keyseir, i wasn't saying for sure thats where the problem lies.
[08:13] <Keyseir> mooey, http://pastebin.com/824785
[08:13] <Keyseir> mooey, OK.
[08:13] <ixian_> to lure more people to ubuntu to use the sexy 3d desktop
[08:14] <pravin> i cant access any site through firefox. i have to enter the IP address to access sites. and i get the ip by pinging the site from the terminal.
[08:14] <Landon> Hey, anyone know where I can find the driver for the BCM4306?
[08:14] <mooey> Keyseir, but i've had some issues with apps with the lines in my xorg.conf that relate to a wacom tablet (which i dont have) so that might be something to look at
[08:15] <mooey> pravin, does browsing with other browsers (like epiphany) work?
[08:15] <Keyseir> mooey, I just noticed " https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/42553 "
[08:15] <Keyseir> mooey, Looks like something extraneous in my xorg.conf file could definitely be it
[08:15] <pravin> mooey:  i dont have epiphany installed
[08:15] <whiteandnerdy> I also Googled the error message, but only found one thread from the Debian mailing list from Dec 2000 -- and that had to do with portmap not running.  portmap *IS* running.
[08:15] <pravin> mooey: I'll try with links
[08:16] <pravin> will have to download it. give me a few minutes.
[08:16] <whiteandnerdy> Other than that one irrelvant thread I find nothing.
[08:17] <mooey> Keyseir, that looks a likely candidate :-)
[08:17] <whiteandnerdy> Is there an Ubuntu server channel or something?  or a different channel where I can get help with NFS?  It seems I'm in the wrong place.
[08:17] <Keyseir> mooey, I commented out some wierd tablet input device thingies and I'm getting wierd gedit errors when I try to save
[08:17] <mooey> Keyseir, what errors specifically?
[08:17] <Keyseir> mooey, http://pastebin.com/824787
[08:18] <mooey> whiteandnerdy, this is the right channel for ubuntu server support
[08:18] <whiteandnerdy> mooey, ah okay.
[08:18] <Keyseir> mooey, hit  close and it crashed
[08:18] <mooey> Keyseir, heh. nano? :}

[08:20] <glick> why not whiteandnerdy
[08:20] <pravin> er dont know what pastebin is
[08:21] <mooey> !pastebin
[08:21] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:21] <whiteandnerdy> glick, Solaris is...well...Solaris.  Linux is...well...Linux.
[08:21] <pravin> !pastebin
[08:21] <whiteandnerdy> glick, they are different.
[08:21] <pravin> mooey:  um, so what do i do about my resolver?
[08:21] <whiteandnerdy> glick, they are made for different tasks and are tuned for different uses.
[08:21] <mooey> pravin, its likely that firefox times out waiting for your dns resolvers to... resolve. you should try using some alternative ones or shout at your isp
[08:22] <l337> ok i got beryl running but i dont see a splash screen and my terminal shows this
[08:22] <l337> l337@l337-laptop:~$ XGL Absent, checking for NVIDIA
[08:22] <l337> Nvidia Absent, assuming AIGLX
[08:22] <l337> beryl: No composite extension

[08:22] <l337> Nvidia Absent, assuming AIGLX
[08:22] <l337> beryl: No composite extension
[08:22] <Keyseir> brb
[08:22] <mooey> pravin, you can set new ones in system -> administration -> networking -> dns
[08:22] <pravin> mooey: but when i'm running windows, i dont face any issues
[08:22] <grndslm> speaking of paste, is there a way to turn off timestamps of others signing in and out of a channel in xchat?
[08:22] <grndslm> it makes the ubuntu channel scroll too quickly
[08:22] <AccessDenied> pravin:  Here's an idea.  Find out what DNS's you're using when running windows and then copy those into your Linux Network settings.
[08:23] <pc3_> \#surabaya
[08:23] <kraut> moin
[08:23] <pravin> AccessDenied:  but my DNS IPs change everytime
[08:23] <mooey> pravin, so use some static ones like 4.2.2.1 & 4.2.2.2
=== pc3_ is now known as \j
[08:23] <whiteandnerdy> AccessDenied, I'm pretty sure the ISP would assign him the same DNS servers -- probably even the same IP, because he has the same modem hooked up (e.g. the MAC ID doesn't changed)
[08:24] <AccessDenied> which is why I suggested it White and Nerdy..
[08:24] <AccessDenied> Unless there is someone at the exchange or ISP running around with patch leads having a good laugh.
[08:24] <SpAc> Woo! Just got Beryl on!
[08:25] <SpAc> Looks quite amazing when you're running a dual monitor setup too!
[08:25] <Rob125> Beryl is pretty sweet for about 30 minutes, and then it grates
[08:25] <mooey> agree
[08:25] <AccessDenied> The IPs may change..  But your DNS typically remains pretty static..  I've had the same DNS servers on my account for..  Dunno..  5 years?  6 maybe?  only the ip has been changed to protect the innocent.
[08:25] <pravin> whiteandnerdy: I checked. there are about 3-4 that i get assigned. doh. i could add all 3 ips
[08:26] <SpAc> my only problem is... once i enable it, I loose the title bars of all my windows!
[08:26] <AccessDenied> :D
[08:26] <Rob125> Alas, it appears I'll never find a driver other than Turboprint for a Canon Pixma MP 150.
[08:26] <whiteandnerdy> pavin, ah okay.  Personally I would put in the 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 numbers
[08:26] <whiteandnerdy> pravin, those *ARE* the best.
[08:26] <pravin> okay, i'll add 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2
[08:26] <mooey> i love those ips
[08:26] <Rob125> SpAc: recommend you restart the window manager, and use emerald to find a decent theme that has them.
[08:27] <AsheD> anybody use acidrip in here?
[08:27] <SpAc> Rob125: thanks... I did try that... might jump over to #ubuntu-xgl
[08:28] <whiteandnerdy> Okay so is there a certain time of day that NFS experts can be found here?
[08:28] <Keyseir> mooey, I broke x =(
[08:28] <mooey> Keyseir, :O
[08:28] <mooey> Keyseir, how so?
[08:28] <Keyseir> mooey, commented out some input devices and restarted
[08:28] <whiteandnerdy> AccessDenied, right, my DNS servers were the same from 1997 until I switched ISPs in 2005.  eight years.  same numbers.
[08:28] <Keyseir> mooey, Evidently it needed one of those
[08:29] <mooey> Keyseir, did you comment them out at the end of the file, too?
[08:29] <Keyseir> mooey, commented out stuff that was suggested too
[08:29] <Keyseir> mooey, end of the file..? uhhh
[08:29] <AccessDenied> whiteandnerdy:  QED...  :D
[08:29] <whiteandnerdy> Keyseir, any errors?
[08:29] <pravin> okay! that worked!!!! thanks guys!
[08:29] <AccessDenied> And me being from Australia means that all ISPs go as cheap as possible on their servers and so if they have more than 2 it's time for a party..
[08:29] <dsranieri> Greetings every one I am a new user to unbuntu and want to introduce myself.
[08:29] <Keyseir> mooey, nope. I totally missed that "end of the file" thing!
[08:29] <whiteandnerdy> AccessDenied, the text editor qed?
[08:30] <AccessDenied> Quad Erit Demonstratum.
[08:30] <AccessDenied> "Which has been demonstated"
[08:30] <AccessDenied> Latin dude..  Not linux..
[08:30] <Keyseir> mooey, take II
[08:30] <mooey> Keyseir, not sure if i mean the end of the file. but you need to remove the devices and then remove them from ServerLaout
[08:30] <whiteandnerdy> AccessDenied oh haha
[08:30] <mooey> Keyseir, good luck ;p
[08:30] <whiteandnerdy> pravin, no problem.
[08:30] <Keyseir> mooey, serverlayout is at the end of the file, and that's what I overlooked. thx
[08:31] <mooey> :)
[08:31] <Keyseir> mooey, Do I have to comment out both, or just hte server layout?
[08:31] <mooey> whiteandnerdy, if no one here knows about nfs it might be worth posting to the forums or on the nfs mailing list
[08:31] <mooey> Keyseir, the devices you want removed -> comment them out, also comment out the references to them in the ServerLayout section
[08:31] <Keyseir> mooey, k
[08:31] <aios> sh
[08:32] <SpAc> can i set one of my monitors as the "primary" monitor? That is, the one that has the gnome panels on etc.?
[08:32] <zipzo> how do i install a .run file in ubuntu?
[08:32] <mooey> zipzo, $ chmod +x file.run; ./file.run
[08:32] <mooey> generally
[08:32] <whiteandnerdy> mooey, um, the Ubuntu forums or are there NFS forums?
[08:32] <AsheD> if I do [in terminal] : do blah && do bloop, will blah run completely before bloop starts?
[08:32] <ameyer> yep
[08:33] <ameyer> I think
[08:33] <mooey> provided blah dosen't fork, yea
[08:33] <mooey> whiteandnerdy, i dont know of any nfs forums. the ubuntu forums are a helpful and friendly place :D
[08:33] <whiteandnerdy> mooey okay :)
[08:33] <whiteandnerdy> I registered but never posted
[08:33] <dsb> I am having trouble installing mysql-server. I've tried a couple installation methods, synaptic and apt-get, but I get the same error.
[08:34] <mooey> ditto. search always finds what i need :)
[08:34] <mooey> dsb, what is the error?
[08:34] <dsb>  I have my error results in pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31850/
[08:34] <Byan> hey, how do I use a .diff file?
[08:34] <zipzo>  $ chmod +x file.run; ./file.run   is where both instances of file.run ar ethe fil im installing or just the last?
[08:34] <Flannel> ameyer: yes.  And it will only run if blah returns 0 (success)
[08:34] <whiteandnerdy> Byan, have you tried using gdit?
[08:34] <Flannel> ameyer: er, 1, success.
[08:34] <whiteandnerdy> s/gdit/gedit/
[08:35] <Byan> whiteandnerdy: how?
[08:35] <mooey> Keyseir, any luck? :)
[08:35] <Keyseir> mooey, Hey hey hey, i didn't crash x!
[08:35] <mooey> woo o/~
[08:35] <whiteandnerdy> Byan, open it in gedit?
[08:35] <Keyseir> mooey, and kde apps seem to be working =D
[08:35] <orospakr> Hi.  I've dist-upgraded a server from dapper to edgy, and the changes to courier's packages have caused dpkg to have a seizure. "courier-authdaemon is in a very bad inconsistent state".  No amount of poking of apt-get or dpkg seems to fix it.
[08:35] <zipzo> so i still need help installing a .run file
[08:36] <mooey> Keyseir, excellent
[08:36] <mooey> zipzo, file.run in the example should be replaced with the name of the .run file you have
[08:36] <Keyseir> mooey, Thanks for the assistance. Yeah, excellent
[08:36] <whiteandnerdy> zipzo: yes
[08:36] <zipzo> in both instances?
[08:36] <mooey> Keyseir, np.
[08:37] <Byan> whiteandnerdy: looks like a script
[08:37] <zipzo>  $ chmod +x file.run; ./file.run
[08:37] <zipzo> i see two file.run in there
[08:37] <mooey> dsb, are you installing mysql from scratch or was it / is it already installed?
[08:37] <mooey> zipzo, the first command makes it executable. the second actually runs it.
[08:37] <JDStone> zipzo: yes, the command makes it executable, the second runs it
[08:37] <JDStone> oh, oops
[08:38] <zipzo> ok ill try it
[08:38] <Byan> whiteandnerdy: oh, looks like I use patch
[08:38] <dsb> mooey: I first tried from scratch, I then tried to reinstall. I also tried to completely remove and then install, but all with the same errors
[08:38] <whiteandnerdy> Byan, ah okay.  then do that :)
[08:39] <manny0> man anyone got a good browser i can use. that doesnt suck with myspace?
[08:39] <SpAc> easy fixed... had left out the AddARGBGLXVisuals from the xorg.conf
[08:39] <zipzo> well that didnt work
[08:39] <Byan> whiteandnerdy: now, if I knew how to do that =/
[08:39] <Rob125> manny0: firefox.
[08:39] <Rob125> if it sucks, then it sucks properly.
[08:40] <whiteandnerdy> manny0: Konqueror
[08:40] <whiteandnerdy> Byan, sudo apt-get install patch
[08:40] <feugan3333> Hi all. Does anyone know how I can find out which network driver I am using?
[08:40] <mooey> dsb, wierd. i would use dpkg to force a remove & purge of mysql-server & then try reinstalling it.
[08:40] <Byan> whiteandnerdy: patch is alreayd installed
[08:41] <aios> where are the initial bash vars set?
[08:41] <Rob125> oh, duh. Who was the guy that was in here looking for a bracket-matching text-editor?
[08:41] <zipzo> i just get no such file or directory when i do  $ chmod +x file.run; ./file.run
[08:41] <Rob125> gedit's got an option for that.
[08:41] <Rob125> zipzo: replace the 'file' bit with the name of the file ;)
[08:41] <mooey> aios, ~/.bashrc
[08:41] <aios> mooey: couldn't find any in there...
[08:42] <zipzo> di dthat
[08:42] <zipzo> i honestly did it, i even dragged it in
[08:42] <dsb> mooey: sudo dpkg purge mysql-server?
[08:42] <Rob125> are you working in the proper directory?
[08:42] <mooey> aios, it includes some other files. perhaps something in ~/.bash_profile?
[08:42] <zipzo> i hope so
[08:42] <Rob125> do an ls
[08:42] <Rob125> are you working from terminal, btw?
[08:43] <Byan> whiteandnerdy: looks like I got it
[08:43] <Byan> I think
[08:43] <whiteandnerdy> Perfect.  How the heck do I search the Ubuntu forums for the word not?
[08:43] <whiteandnerdy> Byan, great!
[08:43] <zipzo> yes, terminal
[08:43] <Rob125> mmgood

[08:49] <whiteandnerdy> dcordes: Journaling is the big one.
[08:49] <Rob125> all kidding aside, i have no clue
[08:49] <oshlap> i am trying unsuccesfully to make ubuntu dapper suspend on my laptop
[08:49] <oshlap> can anyone hep
[08:49] <oshlap> can anyone help?
[08:49] <netnull> hello guys. is my impression or Edgy is less stabile and fast then dapper??
[08:49] <oshlap> i use ubuntu 6.06
[08:50] <mooey> netnull, correct :)
[08:50] <dcordes> ^^
[08:50] <mooey> netnull, edgy is pretty damn stable, but dapper is the distro for you if reliablity is key
[08:50] <trasheurmania> salut$
[08:50] <amir> I have still had too much trouble getting wmv movies to play in firefox on here, can anyone help?
[08:50] <netnull> mooey, that's bad :-) so maybe its better to come back to dapper...
[08:51] <dsb> mooey: I removed and purged, then try to reinstall but I have the same error
[08:51] <AccessDenied> hehe..  Considering that laptop I'm going to install Edgy on, stability is not an issue..  It could crash DOS if I tried..
[08:51] <netnull> i dunno if it depends on compiz, but my distro get blocked quite often
[08:51] <netnull> guys forgive me for my english :-)
[08:51] <dcordes> netnull: i share your impressions about edgy! i tried it on my desktop and rolled back to dapper after i noticed there were strange changes like i couldn't run sh scripts and my ati driver could not be installed.
[08:51] <AccessDenied> netnull:  Your english is fine..
[08:51] <mooey> dcordes, neither of those sound deliberate :o
[08:52] <coffeeguy_> i was wondering why the install disk couldn't load the kernel for install?
[08:52] <mooey> dsb, i'm out of ideas then, sorry. it shouldn't fail, can you file a bug on launchpad please?
[08:52] <Flannel> dcordes: you can run sh scripts.  Only the default interp. is dash, so incorrectly configured scripts who assume bash will have errors if they use bash specific stuff
[08:52] <netnull> thx AccessDenied i'll pay u as soon as possible as we decided :-D
[08:52] <dcordes> mooey: why. i know sh doesn't work anymore. and the driver didn't work. i tried 7 different versions of it(!!)

[08:53] <mooey> aios, putting it in ~/.bash_profile is the right place
[08:53] <netnull> there is nobody here on this channel who has a Nvidia GeForce Go5650? or maybe works on a Asus laptop
[08:53] <aios> mooey: thank you
[08:54] <amir> dcordes: any possible way you can show me how to get wmv playing in ff?
[08:54] <mooey> dcordes, if dapper works for you then you should stay for sure

[09:25] <grndslm> it all eventually just operates smoothly after the bad software has been weeded out

[09:43] <Superbok> thank you rausb0 ;)
[09:43] <whiteandnerdy> jimcooncat, if your computer was built after the year 2000 you can't do it in GUI
[09:44] <whiteandnerdy> jimcooncat, however if you are one of the lucky ones with a hardware MIDI chip, totem should be able to play it.  or kmid.
[09:44] <turbopc> does anyone here know about binary traversal trees in java? i cant get much help on #java
[09:45] <whiteandnerdy> jimcooncat, but on the CLI (console), use timidity
[09:45] <whiteandnerdy> turbopc, try #java
[09:45] <jimcooncat> whiteandnerdy, that seems so strange to me
[09:45] <whiteandnerdy> turbopc, doh nevermind.
[09:45] <whiteandnerdy> jimcooncat, the hardware people got cheap and stopped making hardware MIDI chips
[09:45] <whiteandnerdy> jimcooncat, cutting costs is not strange :D
[09:46] <jimcooncat> I installed timidity a while back, I'll look up how to use it again
[09:46] <AccessDenied> whiteandnerdy: But it is annoying for the people that use midi-keyboards and the like..
[09:46] <jimcooncat> I've been using computers so long I didn't realize MIDI wasn't included anymore.
[09:47] <znejk> hmm my altgr key stopped working in X anyone got any ideas?
[09:47] <jazzrocker> how can i poll my RAM usage from CLI?
=== jckdck is now known as weepy
[09:47] <bimberi> jazzrocker: free
[09:47] <rausb0> jazzrocker: free or cat /proc/meminfo
[09:47] <jimcooncat> I was curious why some light environments weren't using it for system sounds
[09:48] <dcordes> how can i make the console to repeat a command automatically?
[09:48] <whiteandnerdy> AccessDenied, yes it is.
[09:48] <rausb0> dcordes: while : ; do COMMAND ; done
[09:48] <weepy> hi - how do i configure the port that SSH server uses ? or am i missing the point
[09:48] <AccessDenied> hehe..  I didn't realise midi wasn't supported until I went to play a really old school game that used midi for it's music..  And the music WASN'T THERE!!  WTF
[09:49] <rausb0> weepy: edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[09:49] <weepy> sweet fanks
[09:49] <dcordes> rausb0: i don't got this sorry. do i have to type this in front of my command?
[09:49] <bilss_> hi again
[09:49] <mixandgo> ademan_, got it to work ;)
[09:49] <rausb0> dcordes: COMMAND would be your command
[09:49] <bilss_> where do i get thesh script from to install firefox 2.0 please
[09:49] <ademan_> mixandgo: sweet, good job
[09:49] <jimcooncat> thanks folks got it
[09:50] <rausb0> dcordes: you enclose the command in an endless while loop
[09:50] <craftybones> Hello all.
[09:50] <rausb0> dcordes: like this: while : ; do ls -la ; done
[09:50] <craftybones> I have a question about automating installs
[09:50] <redDEADresolve> Im am trying to install Edy Eft, Ubuntu 6.10 on my new Dell laptop. Everything loads up and goes smoothy until it asks me to manually partition the hard drive. Edgy does not "see" my hard drive. I just have a blank list. Hard drive has win xp on it and loads fine.
[09:50] <dcordes> rausb0: to be more precisely: i want to repeat "iwlist ath0 scan" all 3 seconds
[09:50] <whiteandnerdy> Are you guys gonna add FF2 to the Dapper repos?  ever?
[09:51] <rausb0> dcordes: while : ; do iwlist ath0 scan ; sleep 3 ; done
[09:51] <craftybones> I am trying to build a custom CD consisting of a basic desktop server along with LAMP
[09:51] <dcordes> rausb0: ok thanks. btw i told ASPj your regards about his ralink programs.
[09:51] <craftybones> The Wiki guide online is a little unclear about a few things. Rather I was unclear about a few things on the wiki about custom cd installs
[09:51] <rausb0> rausb0: nice :)
[09:51] <rausb0> dcordes: nice :)
[09:51] <AccessDenied> redDeadresolve: Perhaps try something like install partition magic on windows.  Change the partition to free up enough space and try again..  Why stuff around if there is an easier way?
[09:51] <dcordes> rausb0: you remember?
[09:52] <rausb0> dcordes: you i do
[09:52] <dcordes> k
[09:52] <dcordes> rausb0: ever tried his mdk2?
[09:52] <redDEADresolve> windows loaded fine, then i deleted the partition to make for a full ubuntu instsll
[09:52] <rausb0> dcordes: not yet
[09:52] <craftybones> The big question is how do I slip these packages into the install CD? The wiki talks about "getting debs" and "putting them in", but doesn't quite tell you how
[09:53] <suavsilk> how can i adjust the Brightness/Contrast etc, within Ubuntu Edgy?
[09:53] <dcordes> rausb0: you should. it's a nice piece of code
=== Seriii`bnc is now known as Serii
[09:53] <bimberi> craftybones: fyi, Ubuntu's server cd image includes a lamp install option
[09:53] <craftybones> bimberi: thx
[09:53] <craftybones> bimberi: I noticed
[09:53] <craftybones> bimberi: However, there are a few other things I need to add in as well(Eclipse etc)
[09:54] <rausb0> dcordes: what exactly does mdk2? mass deauth only or more?
[09:54] <bimberi> bimberi: kk, 'twas just a 'fyi' :)
[09:54] <craftybones> bimberi: All I would like is either an example or an idea of how to get the necessary debs(Eclipse let's say) and stick it into the pool
[09:54] <AccessDenied> Reddead: So.  Is the entire HDD without partitions?
[09:54] <craftybones> if I have one example, I can carry on from there...
[09:54] <LazyAngel> how do i set the bit on a dir so that files created in it will have the same group?
[09:54] <dcordes> rausb0: there are several options. i don't have it right here now but you can also simulate clients i think
[09:54] <redDEADresolve> no it has one i got that part right in gparted
[09:55] <rausb0> dcordes: simulate clients? what would that be good for?
[09:55] <dcordes> rausb0: you can flood aps with it
[09:55] <suavsilk> how can i adjust the Brightness/Contrast etc, within Ubuntu Edgy?
[09:55] <rausb0> dcordes: oh, hehe :)
[09:55] <whiteandnerdy> I'm out of disk space.
[09:55] <bimberi> craftybones: (in case you haven't seen this) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization
[09:55] <craftybones> bimberi: I saw that and was unclear about how to get the debs
[09:55] <whiteandnerdy> is there any compression apps for Ubuntu?  like DoubleSpace?
[09:55] <dennister> ok, i have further problems here in trying to debug my make
[09:56] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: to compress files? use "tar cvzf zipped.tar.gz directory/
[09:56] <dennister> the error messages said to look at this link: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/mtrr.html
[09:56] <AccessDenied> reddead:  hmm.  This makes it difficult.  Will think on it for a moment..  (Don't rely on me though)
[09:56] <rausb0> dcordes: i also tested the official rt2570 driver from ralink recently. it can do wpa and wpa2 without the need of wpa_supplicant.
[09:56] <whiteandnerdy> LazyAngel, I know about tar, and I even prefer bzip2, but I am *out* of disk space.  0bytes free left on all devices.
[09:57] <whiteandnerdy> I have a better question.
[09:57] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: outch :)
[09:57] <bimberi> craftybones: i guess download them via http://packages.ubuntu.com
[09:57] <whiteandnerdy> How do I free disk space without deleting my files!?
[09:57] <dennister> my mtrr file was empty, so i'm trying to figure out my video card's registers
[09:57] <craftybones> bimberi: that's what I thought, but didn't want to burn too many coasters before I figured it was correct or wrong
[09:57] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: i guess the easiest way is to upload it somewhere?
[09:57] <whiteandnerdy> LazyAngel, well I had NFS problems, so I have nothing
[09:58] <dennister> the results of the methods that the mplayer doc says to use, however, are confusing
[09:58] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: btw... isn't there a dir in memory somewhere?
[09:58] <whiteandnerdy> LazyAngel, hmm?
[09:58] <rausb0> dcordes: but the official ralink driver lacks support for monitor mode
[09:58] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: i wonder if it is /dev/shm
[09:58] <dennister> could someone please help me try and figure this out if i use a pastebin?
[09:59] <whiteandnerdy> LazyAngel: Yeah it's got 244M free.  that's a RAM disk?
[09:59] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: you can move files to memory, but if you turn of your computer, they'll be gone, so be careful
[09:59] <LazyAngel> i'll just google it first
[09:59] <bimberi> craftybones: yes, the page doesn't provide much detail on it :|  Use a CD-RW :)
[10:00] <whiteandnerdy> the problem: /dev/hda3             5.5G  5.2G     0 100% /
[10:00] <craftybones> bimberi: thx
[10:00] <whiteandnerdy> the real problem: /dev/hda2              22G   22G  119M 100% /windows

[10:00] <redDEADresolve> Im am trying to install Edy Eft, Ubuntu 6.10 on my new Dell laptop. Everything loads up and goes smoothy until it asks me to manually partition the hard drive. Edgy does not "see" my hard drive. I just have a blank list. Hard drive has win xp on it and loads fine.
[10:01] <whiteandnerdy> I was planning on NFSing everything from Windows on to my shiny new 100G drive on my file server, but my Ubuntu there doesn't want to be an NFS server x_x
[10:01] <whiteandnerdy> LazyAngel thx
[10:01] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: so i guess you have to copy some files over there so you can use tar.gz
[10:01] <AccessDenied> I'm still 2 hrs away from Edgy being downloaded..  I'll be installing on my lappy shortly..  I'll see if I get the same problem..  :P
[10:01] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: what about setting it up as a samba server?
[10:01] <dennister> !pastebin
[10:01] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:02] <whiteandnerdy> LazyAngel: *shudder* no way in heck
[10:02] <rausb0> whiteandnerdy: i often use tar and netcat to copy whole filesystems over a local net
[10:02] <craftybones> How do I get a deb using apt-get ?
[10:02] <craftybones> only the .deb that is
[10:02] <LazyAngel> whiteandnerdy: hehe. :D oh well... good luck. i have to run
[10:02] <craftybones> I don't need the whole install...
[10:02] <whiteandnerdy> okay bye LazyAngel
[10:03] <bimberi> craftybones: apt-get -d  (probably puts the the deb(s) in /var/cache/apt/archives)
[10:04] <craftybones> bimberi: thx a load. I remember asking something like this in #debian a few years ago, and basically those folks made sure my computer never worked again
[10:05] <foxpaul> hi all - does anyone have any ideas why my touchpad doesn't scroll at all?
[10:05] <BadKitty> Hi Amaranth
[10:05] <bimberi> craftybones: what makes you so sure I'm not grinning evilly right now? ;)
[10:05] <Amaranth> hi
[10:05] <cpk1> i cant seem to mount my rewrittable cd =(
[10:06] <craftybones> bimberi: I am a few years older these days. AND its not my comp :D
[10:06] <bimberi> craftybones: rofl!
[10:07] <cpk1> it just hangs when i do sudo mount -o loop /dev/hdd /media/cdrom0
[10:07] <Ollieh> anyone with installation help...i put the cd in, boot the computer, the ubuntu installation loads and then when i press install, it loads for two seconds and then freezes
=== Echtor`off is now known as Echtor2oo3
[10:07] <Ollieh> ideas anyone?
[10:08] <craftybones> Ollieh: Could be a host of issues.
[10:09] <craftybones> Ollieh: clean the CD, try again.
[10:09] <cpk1> is there supposed to be a special option when mounting RW cd's?
[10:10] <craftybones> cpk1: Unknown.
[10:10] <craftybones> cpk1: unlikely
[10:11] <pybe> cpk1, what happens when you just do mount /media/cdrom
[10:11] <pybe> cpk1, what happens when you just do mount /media/cdrom
[10:13] <mzli> hi man what are you doing? go to wc?
[10:13] <pybe> cpk1, what happens when you just do mount /media/cdrom
[10:13] <Joe_CoT> yay netsplits!
[10:14] <minimec> Kazuhiro: The alternate Install CD is like the good old Debian Installer. I don't think that you have any encryption support during installation... (I  may be wrong)
[10:14] <folder> Hi guys. Any known issues installing Ubuntu on a Thinkpad T41 ? After the initial progress-bar/ubuntu logo, and a delay, I'm left with a flashing textmode cursor in the top left of the screen.
[10:14] <dromer> hmmm, two out of 5 times, when I boot in ubuntu, the system can't connect to the internet
[10:15] <cpk1> pybe: tells me wrong fs type bad option etc
[10:15] <Kazuhiro> minimec, the etch installer disk has it. hmm wonder what method it is using, The damn wiki doesn't tell me much.
[10:15] <folder> oh, and I can see "Calling INT 0x15 (F000:66EB) <cr> EAC is 0x5F08" on tty1, repeated about five times.
[10:15] <pybe> cpk1, whats the line in /etc/fstab for your cdrom
[10:15] <folder> six times actually.
[10:15] <weepy> how do i enable the 'universe' repository ?
[10:16] <pybe> folder, which ubuntu are you installling
[10:16] <folder> sorry, I should have said - 6.10, Edgy.
[10:16] <minimec> Kazuhiro: I see. So I am not up to date ;)
[10:17] <folder> First timer. I have tried every Fedora release up until now when I decided to try Ubuntu instead of FC6..
[10:17] <whiteandnerdy> !sourceomatic | weepy
[10:17] <ubotu> weepy: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[10:17] <pybe> mmm, I had a similar issue with 6.06 which was then fix with 6.06.1 on my vaio, but edgy works fine
[10:17] <cpk1> pybe: mount /media/cdrom tells me wrong fs type bad option etc
[10:17] <folder> I should google the "Calling INT 0x15" thing really.. didn't spot that until I tried looking at other tty's just now.
[10:18] <pybe> cpk1, whats the line in /etc/fstab for your cdrom
[10:18] <cpk1> pybe: /dev/hdd        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
[10:18] <cpk1> also this cdrw has data on it already I am pretty sure
[10:19] <pybe> cpk1, try a "proper" cd
[10:19] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1: try   mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdd /media/cdrom
[10:20] <whiteandnerdy> Is there an smv?  like scp but move?
[10:20] <dennister> hi cpk1
[10:20] <cpk1> hi dennister
[10:20] <pybe> whiteandnerdy, nafaik
[10:21] <altereg0`> !seen thoreauputic
[10:21] <ubotu> I haven't seen thoreauputic recently
[10:21] <folder> Could it be X that's failing? There's no other output, but tty8 is the one with this flashing cursor, and tty1 just gives the "Calling INT 0x15" thing. I'll try safe graphics installer
[10:21] <dennister> !config.h
[10:21] <dromer> anybody know what this could be?   two out of 5 times, when I boot in ubuntu, the system can't connect to  the internet
[10:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about config.h - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:21] <fribuntu> whiteandnerdy: You can write your own little shell script first scping and then rming :)
[10:21] <whiteandnerdy> fribuntu hehe true
[10:21] <fribuntu> dromer: Hmm ... maybe a problem with your ISP?
[10:21] <valehru_server> !Broadcom
[10:21] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:21] <whiteandnerdy> pybe >.<
[10:21] <dennister> ok...guys i really need some help with this config.h file that was created during my ./configure script
[10:21] <dromer> fribuntu: don't think so, my server has been online all the time :P
[10:21] <whiteandnerdy> YIPES, .xsession-errors is 5MiB
[10:21] <dromer> a reboot always fixes it
[10:21] <fribuntu> Can anybody tell me, why there is only a network-manager-pptp pluging, but no network-manager-openvpn plugin available for Ubuntu?
[10:22] <keithg> Does anyone have any experience with ogle?
[10:22] <cpk1> hrmm well mounting a normal cd works but an ls of /media/cdrom doesnt show all the data that i know is on it...
[10:22] <minimec> Kazuhiro: As far as I understand, you can choose between different encryptions like dm-crypt, GnuPG, loop-AES in etch ....
[10:22] <cpk1> also root as 2 loops going for some reason...
[10:22] <whiteandnerdy> fribuntu -- Because people who run VPNs are smart enough to use ttys for configuration?  :D
[10:22] <fribuntu> dromer: so you are in your own intranet connected to a router via switch?
[10:22] <dennister> could someone pls help me? the make is expecting some arguments in this file and i have no idea how to give it the info it needs
[10:22] <folder> fribuntu: sorry, off topic, but I played with network manager's pptp plugin about 6 months ago on FC5, and couldn't get it to work, plus the configuation options were stupid like it asking for passwords that were ignored etc. How does it look now? It's it "proper"?
[10:22] <cpk1> and automount seems to have stopped working
[10:23] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1, do you have another CD drive to swap?
[10:23] <dromer> hmm, it's a university-network, so I have a RJ45 socket in my room, there is a switch connected to that
[10:23] <anarchyao> wow... hi
[10:23] <anarchyao> holy cow theres a lot of people here
[10:23] <whiteandnerdy> Hellp anarchyao.
[10:23] <dennister> anarchyao: love the nic
[10:23] <whiteandnerdy> Hello anarchyao.
[10:23] <anarchyao> do you know what its from?
[10:23] <dennister> my son likes to call his pc anarchy
[10:23] <anarchyao> most people think im an anarchist lol
[10:23] <whiteandnerdy> anarchyao, yes there are a lot of people here :)
[10:23] <fribuntu> whiteandnerdy: I have no problems configuring openvpn, but I think having a nice little button to start it instead of firing up a shell and do it manually, is a good idea. And since I am using network-manager for WLAN settings already and plugins do exist outside the Ubuntu world, I'd very much like to use it.
[10:24] <cpk1> whiteandnerdy: no, this was literally working a couple hours ago
[10:24] <dennister> anarchists were a movement in russian history
[10:24] <anarchyao> its from Anarchy Online... I couldnt think of a name to post on forums and came up with this real quick ... stuck with me :(
[10:24] <anarchyao> I have a question though
[10:24] <dennister> well get in line :)
[10:24] <dennister> j/k
[10:24] <fribuntu> folder: I have no idea, if it is proper. I am not using PPTP for anything. It sucks. I want openVPN :)
[10:24] <whiteandnerdy> fribuntu true
[10:25] <anarchyao> i took the dive into linux tonight... dual booting xp and ubuntu now.  I actually neglected to do my PAST DUE hw ... either it was the ADD meds or ubuntu is amazing to work with, I'm thinking it's a little of both.
[10:25] <kamui> how do I rename multiple files?  In dos I could do a ren *.ext *.ext2, or move too, but if I try to mv the files at the console I get a second target is not a directory
[10:25] <dennister> i'm having trouble with my configure/make and i guess no one knows how to help
[10:25] <folder> fribuntu: fair enough :D ISTR the openvpn plugin being well done, and the pptp guy based his stuff around their framework or something.
[10:25] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1, yeah BUT hardware CAN fail within a few hours, heck I had a hard drive once that went from 100% working to not even able to read the file system in about five hours
[10:25] <anarchyao> I am having one issue with this wonderful operating system... I cant seem to detect most of my hardware, the only piece of hardware that isnt being detected that really is affecting me is my display adapter... Im having to use 800x600 resolution
[10:25] <fribuntu> folder: Well, that is my issue. There is no openVPN plugin for Ubuntu!
[10:26] <folder> It's not looking promising for Ubuntu on my Thinkpad T41 :( safe graphics mode doesn't work either :(
[10:26] <whiteandnerdy> folder, try textmode
[10:26] <Techboy74> Hi All Does Ubuntu's generic kernel support SMP? I'm currently running an mencoder convert but it seems only 1 core of my dual core CPU wakes up to 100% the other stays at 46% sometimes they swap
[10:26] <cpk1> well i do have another one i suppose but I am in the middle of a huge file transfer right now and cant power off for about another 14 hours =X
[10:26] <fribuntu> folder: I'd have to get network-manager from out-of-ubuntu sources, which would break package management for that particular application. Something I try to avoid.
[10:26] <pybe> kamui, try rename
[10:26] <dromer> fribuntu:  it's a university-network, so I have a RJ45 socket in my room, there is
[10:26] <dennister> anarchyao: have you installed any proprietary video card drivers?
[10:26] <dromer>                    a switch connected to that
[10:26] <dennister> like ati or nvidia?
[10:27] <folder> fribuntu: bugger :(. I went through the whole process of trying to get NM plugins working with Fedora and it was a nightmare - compiling NM sources was fine, but it screwed the system, dependencies, configuration files etc. was just wierd.
[10:27] <kamui> pybe: thanks, just looked it up
[10:27] <kamui> :)
[10:27] <anarchyao> I went to Applications --> Add/Remove Programs and installed MANY addons and whatnot... including an Nvidia driver thingy for later released nvidia cards
[10:27] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1 ouch -- do you NEED the CD drive for 14 hours thogh?
[10:27] <anarchyao> but... I dont know how to manually run the actual program
[10:27] <fribuntu> dromer: To be honest, it is very hard to debug intermittent faults via IRC. Have you tried haning a sniffer on the line and see what is going on?
[10:27] <cpk1> no, but i know this will be bugging me until i get to the root of it
[10:29] <folder> whiteandnerdy: I think I'll have to.. hopefully X will be working after the install.
[10:29] <dennister> a
[10:29] <dennister> 
[10:29] <whiteandnerdy> folder, okay
[10:29] <fribuntu> folder: That is part of the reason why I'd much rather have a ready made .deb than do things myself.
[10:29] <dromer> fribuntu: I'm not technically advanced enough to have any idea what that is :P
[10:29] <anarchyao> NVidia binary x. Org driver
[10:29] <anarchyao> that's waht I downloaded
[10:29] <anarchyao> what*
[10:29] <dennister> anarchyao: ok, u said 'later on' did u get a license acceptance message?
[10:29] <fribuntu> dromer: Well, you connect a machine on a hub running "tcpdump" or "wireshark" to see the protocol information.
[10:29] <anarchyao> nope, it doesn't say in the description that it's license restricted
[10:29] <dennister> !nvidia
[10:29] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:29] <dromer> hmm ok, I wonder if I have those progs on my server ...
[10:29] <fribuntu> dromer: It is debugging on a lower level, but very helpful to see what is happening in your case.
[10:29] <folder> How do I start the 6.10 installer in textmode?
[10:29] <fribuntu> folder: I guess you have to toy with the "expert" mode?
[10:29] <altereg0`> folder, you don't unless you use the alternate CD
[10:29] <dennister> ^^^there's a howto that will help you make sure that it's configured and working
[10:29] <folder> fribuntu: I'll have to google that then. There's no expert or anything here
[10:30] <folder> altereg0`: hmm. OK :( This is an unlucky start for me then :D
[10:30] <altereg0`> folder, you need the "alternate" Cd
[10:30] <fribuntu> folder: if you have those tools on a different computer, you might still be out of luck.
[10:30] <folder> i'll play around with the bios, and acpi kernel parameters etc. first then.
[10:30] <dennister> anarchyao: di u see the howto link?
[10:30] <dromer> fribuntu: any advice an running tcpdump ?
[10:30] <fribuntu> folder: The problem is, in a switched network, they will not see the traffic of the other PC unless the switch is in a special "monitor" mode, which will certainly not be the case.
[10:31] <fribuntu> dromer: sorry, see my last answer to folder
[10:31] <fribuntu> dromer: I got you messed up :)
[10:31] <anarchyao> Hmm yeah I'm reading it
[10:31] <dromer> ok ..
[10:31] <anarchyao> It says that if the "lspci | grep -i" command brings back text, I should install this driver
[10:31] <cpk1> whiteandnerdy: also, root has a loop2 and loop1 which it shouldnt need running that i cant kill
[10:31] <anarchyao> However, I don't believe text is coming back

[10:32] <Sarkie> Hi guys, I am having a problem with an old laptop and ubuntu 6.10 (Alternate cd) once installed, it comes to the user login, it will just die if i dont login, but if i login quickly it will dying during that, Die as in cant ctr alt backspace. Any help how to debug it, lappy is celeron 400mhz, 128mb onboard, 32mb used for gfx, so 96mb ram.
[10:32] <anarchyao> Usage: grep [OPTION] ... PATTERN [FILE] ...
[10:32] <anarchyao> Try `grep --help' for more information.
[10:32] <dromer> I don't know if my switch is/can run(ning) that mode
[10:32] <valehru> hey guys, I just installed bcm43xx-fwcutter, and rebooted.  Each time I reboot I get into the login screen and it has completely frozen.  BY frozen I mean zero input is accepted from the keyboard or the mouse.  This is a completely fresh installation...wtf!!!
[10:32] <dennister> k...r u using edgy or dapper?
=== Echtor`off is now known as Echtor2oo3
[10:32] <valehru> edgy.....
[10:32] <anarchyao> Does that count as "text" coming back? :X
[10:33] <valehru> on amd64.
[10:33] <cpk1> whiteandnerdy: so mounting it without -o loop it can mount it but it looks like i cant see all the data on it when i do that
[10:33] <anarchyao> Or should I install this driver anyway?  Hell.. I know I have an nvidia based card.. I'm not a total doofus lol
[10:33] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1 hmm that's strange.  with -o loop you can see it all?
[10:33] <folder> Does the Alternate CD offer the same system i.e. packages etc, or is it totally just a rescue disk or something?
[10:33] <dennister> anarchyao: r u using edgy or dapper versions of ubuntu?
[10:33] <anarchyao> Edhy
[10:33] <anarchyao> Edgy
[10:33] <valehru> I can't even get into a terminal or anything...this entire system seems to have just borked up...
[10:33] <dennister> k...never mind the grep for now
[10:34] <cpk1> whiteandnerdy: dunno, it should automount the cd normally, but whenever i mount isos on my hd i use -o loop =P
[10:34] <minimec> folder: You will have the same Ubuntu with the alternate install CD.
[10:35] <folder> minimec: thank you. It's downloading now, whilst I try acpi=off etc.
[10:35] <dennister> anarchy...he's a better howto for u: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[10:35] <dennister> that's specifically for edgy, and you will probably have to use the xorg reconfigure troubleshooting section on the bottom
[10:36] <minimec> folder: Do that. Installation is quiet simple, but take your time when it comes to the Partition of your disk ...
[10:36] <valehru> hmm...got bcm43xx-fwcutter removed .... has it screwed anyones system up before?  seems to be ok now...but I still have no wifi...dammit.
[10:36] <folder> minimec: of course. thanks :)
[10:36] <dennister> i should have asked you about edgy first, befroe i gave you the first howto link

[10:49] <valehru> Sarkie, I have that exact same problem......
[10:49] <pybe> valehru: the file is .bash_history in the users home directory
[10:49] <CarinArr> dromer, check if there's a qt3 folder in /usr/share/qt
[10:49] <CarinArr> you can check if the package is installed as well
[10:49] <valehru> Sarkie, does it completely seize up on login?  Forcing you to reboot manually, ie pull the battery out?
[10:49] <CarinArr> but that's where it should be

[10:51] <CarinArr> i've had to explicitly tell things where to find qt on more than one occasion
[10:52] <bimberi> dennister: is that the complete config.h?
[10:52] <dromer> CarinArr: I have 2 qt folders: qt3 and qt4
[10:52] <dennister> bimberi: yes...and there is another much longer config.mak
[10:53] <CarinArr> dromer, if you have the headers and stuff installed you probably just have to tell whatever you're trying to install where to find it
[10:53] <dromer> how do I tell the compiler where qt is then ?
[10:53] <Laosboyme> What is Desktop enviroment?
[10:53] <Laosboyme> lol
[10:53] <dennister> but the config.mak seems to be identical to the results from the ./configure command, which had no errors
[10:53] <Acker> AccessDenied: haha ok, I'll try, thanks mate :)
[10:53] <Novek> !broadcom
[10:53] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:53] <CarinArr> dromer, is this the compiler or the configuration script complaining?
[10:53] <bimberi> dennister: i think you need a line with #ENDIF at the end
[10:53] <valehru> Is there a way to find out what was updated through the update manager?  I have a feeling something there screwed up my system.
[10:54] <CarinArr> dromer, you can try simply setting the environment variable QTDIR to /usr/share/qt3
[10:54] <pybe> valehru: whats the issue
[10:54] <dennister> yes, but then i also would need something like an if statment, and i have no idea how to give it what it needs
[10:54] <CarinArr> but if you're running a configuration script, ./configure --help should tell you how to specify it
[10:54] <dromer> ./build gives the error for the complete chemsuite and ./configure for chem2d alone
[10:54] <mcquaid> ok I want to finally give aiglx a try and need the beta nvidia driver,  looking at some of the guides, it looks to be a real pain
[10:55] <dromer> CarinArr: where do I set this variable ?
[10:55] <dennister> i'll try sticking and #ENDIF at the end, ...ok...ty CarinArr, i'll try that, too
[10:55] <valehru> pybe, when I get to the login screen my whole computer hangs, however I can get in through Recovery mode no problem....something must have came down in the updates because Its a completely fresh installation.
[10:55] <mcquaid> I thought I saw a thread where someone maintained a rep with the latest nvidia driver and the associated changes required for the kernel so it's just an apt-get away
[10:55] <dennister> oops, CarinArr was talking to someone else, lol...must be tired
[10:55] <CarinArr> dromer, export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt3
[10:56] <CarinArr> heh s'alright dennister;)
[10:56] <CarinArr> i gathered
[10:56] <pybe> valehru: what is it doing when it hangs

[10:57] <redDEADresolve> anyone got time for a little help?
[10:58] <CarinArr> dromer, yeah before you run the ./configure

[10:58] <whiteandnerdy> redDEADreslove, don't ask to ask, just ask.

[10:58] <CarinArr> dromer, doesn't work as in the command fails, or doesn't work as in you still have the same problem
[10:58] <dromer> I still have the problem

[10:59] <dromer> CarinArr: can i do that on the ./build as well ?
[10:59] <CarinArr> dromer, but if you do echo $QTDIR it should say what you just set it
[10:59] <Laosboyme> help!
[10:59] <CarinArr> dromer, possibly, you can try
[10:59] <SpaceFrog> can an iPod be used as a mass storage device? for word docs, etc?

[11:08] <mcquaid> does anyone know what version he has in there?
[11:08] <jordo23> Anyone here run an AMD 64 distro?
[11:09] <mcquaid> btw, is there a thread maintaining a list of all the user maintained repositories out there?  ubuntu really needs something similar to debain's apt-get.org/search
[11:09] <dennister> jordo23: i tried for months, and finally gave up
[11:09] <crimsun> user-maintained repos are death.
[11:09] <whiteandnerdy> crimsun, not always.  look at winehq's repo.
[11:09] <jordo23> dennister: What did you do then?
[11:10] <mcquaid> yes some are bad, some are good, like winehq's as whiteandnerdy just mentioned
[11:10] <crimsun> whiteandnerdy: that's not a user-maintained repo but a developer-maintained one.
[11:10] <whiteandnerdy> crimsun, true.
[11:10] <mcquaid> yes dev maintained are the best

[11:10] <jordo23> dennister: So you went back to another computer running a 32 bit chip...
[11:10] <whiteandnerdy> not beryl -- libdvdcss2 I mean

[11:12] <jordo23> dennister: did you find that there wasn't some common software and plugins for 64 bit architecture?
[11:12] <whiteandnerdy> crimsun: compiz  deb http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz/ dapper main
[11:12] <dennister> the 64-bit hype is for the windoze crowd, and i'm trying to get away from windoze...yes, but drivers and stuff is still mising for 64-bit platforms

[11:13] <jordo23> dennister: YEah!  I just installed Ubuntu x86_84 and there is no adobe flash plugin!
[11:13] <mcquaid> is there a trick to explore a rep in a browser?  I want to see what version of nvidia driver is available in http://amaranth.selfip.com/
[11:13] <crimsun> whiteandnerdy: never used, but it used to be much worse than it is currently
[11:13] <dennister> the various distros have been trying to get 64-bit versions, but it's still months away
[11:13] <dennister> sun-java's impossible on 64-bit stuff too
[11:14] <jordo23> Dennister: Ubuntu has one though....I am pretty sure that's the version I installed.....
[11:14] <CarinArr> dromer, not really no.. it's explicitly looking for qt2 libraries throughout the configure script.. given how big a change there was between qt3 and 4 i'm not sure it would even work if you managed to get it to use qt3 for compiles
[11:14] <jordo23> Dennister: yeah!  Java wouldn't install correctly the default way.....haven't tinkered with it though..
[11:14] <dromer> hmm :(
[11:14] <CarinArr> best bet is probably finding the qt2 libs
[11:14] <CarinArr> but they're pretty damn old by now
[11:14] <dennister> jordo23: ok, and i installed it too...at first
[11:15] <Laosboyme> how to make ubuntu gray?
[11:15] <jordo23> dennister: yeah.....how far away are 64 bit versions of apps and stuff are we?
[11:15] <jordo23> dennister: for linux
[11:15] <dennister> but i couldn't get things like java to work...never got my tuner working at all...so in desperation i started listening to the pple who said to go the i386 route
[11:16] <whiteandnerdy> Laosboyme, gray???
[11:16] <jordo23> dennister: yeah....I agree with you...
[11:16] <cpk1> hrmm how do you get writing to a cd-rw to work?
[11:16] <dennister> i'm actually still a 3.5 month linux newbie...but my mythbox is almost completely done
[11:16] <dromer> CarinArr: any idea where and how to find those libs ?
[11:16] <dromer> I really want to run chemsuite :(
[11:17] <jordo23> dennister: thanks for the insight though....I though it was just me being stupid when trying to install this stuff.....but wanted to verify that a lot wasn't supported by the architecture...
[11:17] <mcquaid> hmm is there any way to query a rep to see what versions are available without adding it to one's sources list?
[11:17] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1, IDE?
[11:17] <dennister> but then again, i struggled with windoze 64bit, gave up, struggled with alternatives to win mce, finally gave in...then 64-bit versions of so many linux distros...
=== tokenbad is now known as TokenBad
[11:18] <CarinArr> dromer, not sure lemme have a look
[11:18] <dennister> and i've been working with windows since dos 6.1 and win 3.1...i thought i knew stuff like partitioning and dual booting...lol
[11:18] <TokenBad> ok I dual booted my system...I do the sudo df -h but it only shows my master drive...and not my slave which I know is in ntfs and know that can only read with that format but need info off that drive for now
[11:19] <dennister> try and get partition magic 8 working with win 64-bit...took some doing, but i did it
[11:19] <dennister> anyway...i'm getting off-topic
[11:19] <jordo23> thanks though...

[11:19] <Staz> Hi can anyone help me remove grub, I thought I removed all linux/windows partitions but I still get a grub error 21 on boot :(
[11:19] <ginyip> hi all, could anyone help me with ATI and 64 bit ubuntu problem? After I install the ATI driver (both 8.30 and official Ubuntu one I have tried). Start X without problem, but fglrxinfo, system freeze. After screensave on, system also freeze. I also know there is 6.10 out. but it just doesn't do any good. It doesn't even start X, I have tried both alternative CD or Live CD as well. pls help
[11:19] <whiteandnerdy> CPK1 -- are you trying to use an IDE drive?
[11:20] <dennister> now just to get this compile/make working
[11:20] <mcquaid> why go through all this for 64 bit when from what i've read it's not really much faster vs just using i386 compiled versions?
[11:20] <weepy> eg: bash: rails: command not found
[11:20] <dennister> mcquaid: exactly...i386 is wonderful
[11:20] <Discerer> is it possible to install ubuntu from a gentoo live cd?
[11:21] <dennister> Discerer: no...u need an ubuntu livecd
[11:21] <Laosboyme> What is sawfish anyway?
[11:21] <mcquaid> sawfish is gnome's older window manager
[11:22] <Laosboyme> oooo
[11:23] <BlackHawk> hi
[11:23] <dennister> mcquaid: for those of us who are still new to linux, though, we've been buying into microshaft's demands for bigger, newer, more powerful hardware for their so-called-wonderful new os's for so long...it's hard to give up that way of thinking...it's been so ingrained
[11:23] <TokenBad> ok I had vista installed and then was going to dual boot ubuntu....I installed ubuntu on a different partition...but when rebooted it don't show me to boot into vista...
[11:23] <whiteandnerdy> TokenBad, does it say "press ESC for menu"?
[11:24] <TokenBad> I did that...and it just shows the ubuntu kernal
[11:24] <ademan_> is there an svg or at least a hi-res of the firefox fox?
[11:25] <whiteandnerdy> ademan_ I think so hold on a sec
[11:25] <TokenBad> whiteandnerdy, any other ideas?
[11:25] <Adnarim> hi good morning
[11:25] <whiteandnerdy> TokenBad, not really, I have NO Vista experience
[11:25] <folder> I don't bloody believe it! "Warning package libslang-blah-blah was corrupt" whilst installing textmode.
[11:25] <mcquaid> dennister, well my knowledge of 64bit arch is pretty limited, but one of the big benefits I believe is being able to address a lot more memory.  This has advantages for servers much more than for desktop users.  And that's great and all, but when your going to run into so many problems with various software, I'd personally just stick to 386 for the time being
[11:25] <TokenBad> well figured it would work like xp...
[11:26] <folder> hope the download isn't corrupted.
[11:26] <Laosboyme> I'am having trouble with my sd card
[11:26] <Adnarim> has someone from you experience with nmap under ubuntu? could someone please scan me with nmap -sN and show me what it sais? because I try to scan myself (localhost) but it shows nothing
[11:26] <TokenBad> is there a way to access grup from within ubuntu to try and setup dual boot since it didn
[11:28] <ademan_> mcquaid: i hope you mean x86, 386 is anchient, most proccessors are at least 586 p4 is 686... (though i believe that leaves AMD users high and dry so i guess 386 is the "best" you can do)
[11:29] <whiteandnerdy> ademan_ About the Firefox logo
[11:29] <mcquaid> ademan_, nope i mean 386 as in what everything in ubuntu is complied for
[11:29] <whiteandnerdy> ademan_ Mozilla will not allow SVGs to be made of any of their logos, in fact, it against their license to use their logos in high resolutions
[11:29] <mcquaid> they even dropped the 686 kernels
[11:30] <ademan_> whiteandnerdy: wtf? that's retarded, but whatever...
[11:30] <whiteandnerdy> ademan_ ACTUALLY, P4 is a 786.
[11:30] <ademan_> my bad
[11:30] <cpk1> whiteandnerdy: yes its IDE, sorry had my nose buried in the cdrecord man
[11:30] <whiteandnerdy> ademan_ Yes it is very very bad for them
[11:30] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1 hehe no problem :P
[11:30] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1 do this:
[11:30] <bubba> hi
[11:31] <bubba> is here some1 who can help me with my dlink driver
[11:31] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1:      sudo cdrecord dev=atapi:0,0,0 driveropts=help -checkdrive
[11:31] <yahalom> hey :) i put the dns 208.69.222.222 in my resolv.conf yet it still doesnt use it, any ideas?
[11:31] <waylandbill> mcquaid, no real benefit comes from compiling the software outside the kernel for 686 as opposed to 386. The kernel is where you'll see the most benefit really.
[11:31] <bubba> hello can any1 hear me??
[11:32] <bubba> hello i need help with my ubuntu
[11:32] <mcquaid> yep i agree, that's why everything is 386
[11:32] <waylandbill> !ask
[11:32] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:32] <cpk1> whiteandnerdy: that should do what? it spits out pretty much all gibberish

[11:34] <TokenBad> ademan_, the option just isn't there...even though ubuntu was installed to a seperate partition
[11:34] <waylandbill> TokenBad, perhaps it didn't detect it. You could add to menu.lst manually using a chainloader command.
[11:34] <redgun> someone with a toshiba m30x laptop?
[11:34] <linopil> Laosboyme, IS NOT THAT installed by default ?
[11:34] <TokenBad> waylandbill, you just went way over my head

[11:39] <waylandbill> Laosboyme, you mean java dev kit?
[11:39] <Adnarim> then make your own pass with passwd
[11:39] <Nchalada> howang
[11:39] <whiteandnerdy> haha
[11:39] <whiteandnerdy> shoot cpk1 the burning stuff is on my other computer
[11:39] <whiteandnerdy> I should be going to be now
[11:39] <whiteandnerdy> can we finish this tomorrow?
[11:40] <howang> tobias_: try to `updatedb`
[11:40] <Nchalada> if you setup your account right, your pass is exactly what you set it as
[11:40] <Tomcat_> howang: The alt installer does ask for username/pw... or else your system is not correctly installed.
[11:40] <howang> but the installer didn't ask for ANY username/password
[11:40] <howang> :S
[11:40] <howang> hmm
[11:40] <cpk1> whiteandnerdy: of course, i'm not holding you at gunpoint here, just trying to get some brainstorming going =P
[11:41] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1 hahahaha
[11:41] <whiteandnerdy> cpk1 well goodnight :)
[11:42] <waylandbill> howang, never heard of that. It should've asked after the reboot where it installed more packages over the base system.. IIRC.

[11:43] <tobias_> howang: Thanks! Now I can search inside my own private docs! But how to search in system-folders? Is this prohibited now?
[11:43] <cpk1> is it bad that dma is turned off on my cdrom drive?
[11:43] <Tomcat_> cpk1: If it works alright, no.
[11:43] <roconnor> how can I change the keyboard combination that restarts the X server from the default <ctrl>-<alt>-<backspace>?
[11:43] <howang> tobias_, maybe search with root?
[11:44] <Nchalada> tobias_, shouldn't be, most of everything's hidden, just rightclick in Nautilus and click Show Hidden
[11:44] <Williamts99> cpk1 it will probably be a bit slower, if your hardware supports it, it should be enabled, I think dapper and above do this automatically.
[11:44] <Nchalada> found that meself today :D
[11:44] <Nchalada> hehe

[11:45] <yahalom> Williamts99, y?
[11:45] <yahalom> Williamts99, u having issues with it?
[11:45] <valehru> is there an issue where the usplash screen on any AMD64 system is monochrome when starting up the machine?
[11:46] <yahalom> Williamts99, i do digg google.com and get SERVER: 208.67.220.220#53(208.67.220.220)
[11:46] <yahalom>  meaning i'm using it, but if i go to welcome.opendns.com i get the stupid oops page
[11:46] <Williamts99> Well it doesn't really speed anything up, their fishing protection is lagging pretty far behind firefox, and they don't guess that example.com means www.example.com, which bothers me because it sends me to their search page
[11:46] <Williamts99> also you don't get a descriptive message about WHY it went to the search page.
[11:47] <jordo23> Is there a channel for linux gaming?
[11:47] <waylandbill> roconnor, I only see how to disable it with "DontZap" .. probably would need a special build

[12:02] <Billy2> I'm about to try Linux for the first time (Ubuntu 6.10), planning to dual-boot with Windows XP. Can anyone recommend a boot manager and tell me where abouts in the process it needs to be installed (before or after Ubuntu)?
[12:02] <zoople> im seriously thinking of installing Kubuntu
[12:02] <zoople> because, i think that KDE is better from what ive seen
[12:02] <livingdaylight> when i boot up it is not accepting my name /password any longer
[12:02] <Tomcat_> bilss_: There are some howtos on the Ubuntu wiki on how to use FF2 in Dapper.
[12:02] <Tomcat_> Billy2: Use grub, it will install automatically.
[12:02] <knubbe> sitchin: sudo apt-get install rar
[12:03] <Billy2> Fantastic, thanks
[12:03] <dooglus> zoople: in my experience, KDE apps tend to have more features and more bugs than the corresponding GTK apps
[12:03] <gyop> Tomcat_:  When i select Wave Surround. It's mute. And I cant change..
[12:03] <ReYnoLd_ubaya> #surabaya
[12:03] <knubbe> sitchin: sudo apt-get install unrar-free
[12:03] <Williamts99> bilss, check out http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/
[12:03] <bilss_> Tomcat_ i found one it tells howto install the script ni probs but where to get the script for dapper?
[12:03] <Tomcat_> gyop: There might be more than one "Wave Surround". Try the others.

[12:05] <bilss_> Tomcat_ see my reply?
[12:05] <livingdaylight> Tomcat_: fool, i already asked my question
[12:05] <AnAnt> is there a utility to convert dos text files to unix text files
[12:05] <livingdaylight> Tomcat_: did  you think you're clever with your !ask command?
[12:05] <dooglus> livingdaylight: what did you do right before it stopped working?
[12:05] <howang> The underlying authorization mechanism (sudo) does not allow you to run this program. Contact the system administrator. :s
[12:05] <bayzider> Hey I need to know the command to view a web page in the terminal.
[12:05] <AnAnt> !ask dos unix
[12:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ask dos unix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:05] <Tomcat_> bilss_: Yes. Sorry, I don't really know how to use that stuff, never needed it. You might want to try to just manually install FF2 from the mozilla website.
[12:06] <howang> I'm the system administrator =.=
[12:06] <Tomcat_> livingdaylight: Insulting me won't help.
[12:06] <waylandbill> AnAnt: dos2unix
[12:06] <livingdaylight> dooglus: ok, i tried to install a different os on my other hardrive

[12:06] <AnAnt> thx
[12:06] <Williamts99> livingdaylight, is your caps lock key on when it is not accepting your un/pass
[12:06] <livingdaylight> Tomcat_: don't worry, i understand that you are not help, so i'll insult you plent
[12:06] <livingdaylight> Williamts99: LOL, very funny
[12:06] <dooglus> livingdaylight: how many guesses do I have?
[12:06] <waylandbill> AnAnt: sometime's it's all too obvious to think of. ;-)
[12:06] <AnAnt> waylandbill: it's not here
[12:06] <bayzider> Any one know how?
[12:07] <gyop> Tomcat_: My another question, I have a GeForce 4 FX 5200 grap card. Sometimes in firefox, firefox slow down in long pages. Do u have any idea?
[12:07] <livingdaylight> dooglus: so, three is no fix?
[12:07] <bilss_> Tomcat_ that sutff? we are linux here everything is not apt-get you know anyway thanks for your help :)
[12:07] <AnAnt> waylandbill: the command I mean
[12:07] <dooglus> livingdaylight: three?  ok:  1)  is it a proprietary OS?
[12:07] <livingdaylight> dooglus: no, it was mint liunx
[12:07] <gyop> Tomcat_:  Will i any set for grap card?
[12:07] <waylandbill> AnAnt: perhaps it comes in one of the build packages... one sec.
[12:07] <Tomcat_> bilss_: Well, those scripts you're talking about... I can't really help you with those. :\
[12:07] <dooglus> livingdaylight: you've ruined it now.  how are we supposed to answer questions if you give us all the facts?
[12:07] <livingdaylight> dooglus: first it broke grub, then i used SGD to fix Grub but i still cant log in
[12:08] <AnAnt> waylandbill: tofrodos
[12:08] <waylandbill> AnAnt: the package tofrodos
[12:08] <bayzider> then to google.
[12:08] <waylandbill> :)
[12:08] <livingdaylight> dooglus: sorry, :D
[12:08] <dooglus> livingdaylight: where are you typing your username/password?  to gdm?  or a virtual console?  or some boot manager?  or bios?  or what?
[12:08] <AnAnt> thanks
[12:08] <sitchin> knubble: universe rar installed
[12:08] <bilss_> Tomcat:_ ok so is there a apt-get  for FF2 in dapper , manually as in what for example?
[12:08] <sitchin> knubbe: and know
[12:08] <livingdaylight> dooglus: normal gui login, gdm, yes
[12:09] <Tomcat_> gyop: I don't think these two problems are related... but I don't know anything about that anyway. :\
[12:09] <bayzider> Goolge dont even know. =\
[12:09] <livingdaylight> dooglus: thhis is in ubuntu
[12:09] <dooglus> livingdaylight: the easiest fix is probably to boot into rescue mode and reset your password from there
[12:09] <Tomcat_> bilss_: No, I meant download FF2 binary for Linux from mozilla.com, then install that.
[12:09] <livingdaylight> dooglus: ok, is that easy? how do i do that from command line?
[12:09] <dooglus> livingdaylight: type "passwd livingdaylight"
[12:09] <knubbe> sitchin: try to type "rar"
[12:09] <livingdaylight> Tomcat_: !ask
[12:10] <bayzider> Does any one know how to use the terminal as a web browser?
[12:10] <sitchin> rar: command not found
[12:10] <knubbe> sitchin: what does it say? command not found?
[12:10] <dooglus> bayzider: get lynx, links, links2 or w3m
[12:10] <knubbe> uh..
[12:10] <livingdaylight> dooglus: but what if its not the password?
[12:10] <Williamts99> bilss_, http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ will install it for you. :-)
[12:10] <bayzider> dooglus: are the packages?
[12:10] <bilss_> Tomcat: ok thats what i  ment by the sh script thats what it is i expext sorry for misunderstanding:)
[12:10] <dooglus> livingdaylight: 'passwd' lets you set a new password
[12:10] <knubbe> sitchin: try: "unrar-free"
[12:10] <dooglus> livingdaylight: 'livingdaylight' is your userid

[12:11] <bilss_> Williamts99 thanks i will take a look :)
[12:11] <bayzider> dooglus: ok once I have it how do I use it???
[12:11] <livingdaylight> dooglus: but what if it is the username which has got deleted or whatever?
[12:11] <Williamts99> livingdaylight, but instead of root, you would use your username
[12:11] <sitchin> ah it works
[12:11] <sitchin> thanks
[12:11] <dooglus> bayzider: do you see a rectangular box type thing in front of you with lots of buttons on it?
[12:12] <bayzider> dooglus: hold on im still downloading it, but this will let me us the terminal as a graphic-less web browser?
[12:12] <knubbe> sitchin: however. did it unrar your files?
[12:12] <bilss_> Williamts99: i am running a server with minimal X and FIREFOX buit thnks for the url
[12:13] <dooglus> bayzider: yes.  "links2" is a good one
[12:13] <livingdaylight> Williamts99: its not that i forgot my password - its somehow got destroyed while installing another os
[12:13] <knubbe> sitchin: "rar" is not free software, thats why theres both "rar" and "unrar-free"
[12:13] <bayzider> Dooglus: I got it thanks for your help.
[12:13] <knubbe> sitchin: unrar-free, however, doesnt work as good as rar imho.
[12:14] <livingdaylight> dooglus: its tnot that i forgot my password. and what if the username being messed up is part of the problem?
[12:14] <sitchin> ok
[12:14] <dooglus> bayzider: type "links2 http://www.ilikeboys.com/" or whatever - then use the up and down keys to move through the links, left and right do forward and back
[12:14] <sitchin> one sec
[12:14] <Williamts99> livingdaylight, it sets a new password, doesn't matter what happened to the old one
[12:14] <frogzoo> how smooth goes the upgrade from dapper to edgy ?
[12:14] <dooglus> livingdaylight: look in /etc/passwd to see what usernames are defined.
[12:14] <livingdaylight> Williamts99: ok, but what about username? i dnotn' tknow that its being recogfnised either
[12:14] <Williamts99> livingdaylight, either forgot it, or typed it in wrong twice when setting it, etc etc
[12:14] <Tomcat_> frogzoo: Was quite smooth for me, but many people had huge problems.
[12:15] <davidw> hey, how the heck do you boot with init=/bin/bash in the new ubuntu?
[12:15] <frogzoo> Tomcat_: k, thx, will leave it a few weeks in that case
[12:15] <davidw> (first impression is not good: 1) splash screen is hosed, 2) ldap was all foobared up)
[12:15] <sitchin> knubbe: it sees the files in the rar but it failed to decompress
[12:15] <Williamts99> Livingdaylight, check out what dooglus said about /etc/passwd
[12:16] <dooglus> livingdaylight: "grep :1000: /etc/passwd" will show you the first user created
[12:17] <knubbe> sitchin: yea. do "sudo apt-get install unrar"
[12:17] <knubbe> sitchin: (that will install the non-free version, which works better)
[12:17] <sitchin> ok thanks i'll try
[12:19] <sitchin> E: Package has no release candidate

[12:20] <Qwerty> its like its looking up sitename.com forever

[12:20] <pod> +
[12:21] <bayzider> dooglus: is there any like back keys or once I get to a page with no more links I just xout and go to another page?
[12:21] <dooglus> bayzider: left is 'back'
[12:21] <livingdaylight> dooglus: yea, i got it but i can't cd 'passwd' coz its not a directory
[12:21] <dooglus> bayzider: right is 'forward'
[12:21] <dooglus> livingdaylight: cd 'etc' first
[12:21] <dooglus> livingdaylight: 'passwd' is a file
[12:22] <bayzider> dooglus: oh thats on links2? cause im w3m.
[12:22] <fredrin> Hello, How do I change the default email address that cron reports to?
[12:22] <livingdaylight> dooglus: yea, i cant cd to it
[12:22] <dooglus> bayzider: I don't know w3m.  "man w3m" will probably tell you what you need to know.  there will be a key for back, but I don't know it.  also, try hitting '?' or control-h or ...
[12:22] <sitchin> knubbe: E: Package unrar has no installation candidate
[12:22] <dooglus> livingdaylight: show me output from "pwd; ls -ld etc" please?

[12:23] <knubbe> sitchin: uh..
[12:23] <dooglus> livingdaylight: not /etc - /etc is the live CD's /etc - you want /mnt/sda/etc

[12:24] <dooglus> livingdaylight: I know you have.  what does your "no" refer to?
[12:25] <livingdaylight> dooglus: that i can't get into the passwd file?
[12:25] <knubbe> sitchin: sorry i couldnt help. however, i strongly suggest you enable multiverse and install rar and unrar
[12:25] <sitchin> ok than heh :d do i do this in the terminal
[12:26] <dooglus> livingdaylight: maybe you can pastebin what you've done, so I can tell you what's wrong?  I can't see what you're doing, and you're not giving enough information to let me help you.
[12:26] <dooglus> knubbe: it's well worth getting unrar working, because lots of torrents are in rar format.
[12:27] <sitchin> its one in multiple files
[12:27] <geokok> Hi. I have 10 files "Hello-01.jpg" and want to rename to "Bye-01.jpg". How can I do it in one command?
[12:27] <sitchin> which is the issue
[12:27] <dooglus> sitchin: I have unrar working on all rar archives, even split ones.
[12:27] <sitchin> cool
[12:27] <livingdaylight> dooglus: it tells me that that i've mounted /dev/sda1 but when i go to home directory i see that i'm not in ubuntu, but knoppix live so?
[12:27] <sitchin> how do i enable this 'multiverse'
[12:28] <knubbe> !info multiverse
[12:28] <ubotu> Package multiverse does not exist in any distro I know

[12:29] <TLE> sitchin: If you are on Edgy, it's easier with the GUI app
[12:29] <bayzider> dooglus: I dont have to deal with ugly as skins and forums look so much nicer in all text.
[12:29] <sitchin> done
[12:29] <sitchin> now redownload rar?
[12:29] <livingdaylight> dooglus: ok, i've umounted /dev/sda1 can i try again? what do i do?
[12:30] <dooglus> livingdaylight: first become root with "sudo -s"
[12:30] <sitchin> dooglus: do i also remove the text to the right of the url?
[12:30] <livingdaylight> dooglus: i am root,
[12:30] <dooglus> livingdaylight: then make a directory somewhere, mount /dev/sda1 onto that directory, cd into that directory, then "cd etc" then "ls -l passwd" and "df ." and pastebin the whole session

[12:46] <azcazandco> I am having problems with using the file browser and can't figure out what I am doing wrong it only started happening after I upgraded
[12:46] <manny0> yea i tried bcm43xx as well
[12:46] <kanzie_> What do you guys use for torrent? Im having problems with Wine and uTorrent
[12:46] <kestaz> manny0, and works?
[12:46] <sitchin> it does say universe instead of multiverse
[12:46] <CarinArr> manny0, there's something called unshield that might do it for you
[12:46] <CarinArr> !exe
[12:46] <dooglus> sitchin: that's not enough of the file.  how about running a "grep multiverse /etc/apt/sources.list" and pasting the output of that?
[12:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about exe - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:47] <CarinArr> meh
[12:47] <feydin> hi there, could someone recommend me a software to add sound to a video ?
[12:47] <sitchin> oohhh sorry *i have a bit of a hangover
[12:47] <langast01> hello
[12:47] <CarinArr> manny0, hang on, lemme see if i can remember what these things are called;)
[12:47] <langast01> ubuntu help
[12:48] <sitchin> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31876/
[12:48] <frogzoo> what luck have people had with suspend in edgy ?
[12:48] <kanzie_> So what do you use for BitTorrent?
[12:48] <langast01> suspend ?
[12:48] <CarinArr> manny0, there's something called unshield that might do it, there's one called cabextract too
=== kanzie_ is now known as Kanzie
[12:49] <azcazandco> CarinArr: any ideas what might be happening?  I start up the file browser but as soon as I double click filesystem it jumps to a new window and I can only see a handful of folders, if I am in an app I can browser the folders no problems with the tree on the left hand side
[12:49] <frogzoo> langast01: suspend to memory
[12:49] <CarinArr> azcazandco, fraid not.. i don't really use gnome stuff so i haven't a clue
[12:49] <frogzoo> Kanzie: azureus is even better than people say
[12:49] <Qwerty> Kanzie, I use Azureus
[12:49] <manny0> ok i have unshield
[12:49] <da1l6> Hello
[12:49] <CarinArr> azureus here too
[12:49] <manny0> let me figure out how to use it lol
[12:49] <Qwerty> its the best you could get for linux I think
[12:50] <CarinArr> just make sure you have sun java installed
[12:50] <Qwerty> yeah
[12:50] <CarinArr> or azureus will eat your computer
[12:50] <Qwerty> manual installation
[12:50] <Qwerty> yeah lol :P
[12:50] <Kanzie> CarinArr: hehe, yep, checked!
[12:50] <frogzoo> Qwerty: sun's java is in the repos, manual shouldn't be necessary?...
[12:50] <Kanzie> The problem is the resource-hogging that Azureus does
[12:50] <dooglus> sitchin: you're missing some lines there.  this should fix it: sudo sed -i 's/edgy universe$/edgy universe multiverse/' /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:50] <defrysk> ktorrent.....
[12:51] <Qwerty> frogzoo, not sun java, I meant azureus
[12:51] <sitchin> wow ok
[12:51] <azcazandco> any gnome users here?
[12:51] <Qwerty> ubuntu == gnome :D
[12:51] <CarinArr> kanzie, i don't really have problems with azureus eating resources when using sun java
[12:51] <frogzoo> azcazandco: given that gnome is ubuntu default...
[12:51] <sitchin> and now
[12:51] <dooglus> CarinArr: I do.  azureus usually eats about 400MB of memory
[12:51] <CarinArr> azcazandco, i'm just rare;)
[12:51] <azcazandco> so does anyone know why I keep loosing the file tree in nautilis?
[12:52] <Qwerty> lol it eats like 50 MB here
[12:52] <BlackHawk> Qwerty> ubuntu == gnome :D <- not always ^^
[12:52] <dooglus> Qwerty: seriously?
[12:52] <Qwerty> err yeah, generally speaking :D
[12:52] <Kanzie> Ok... starting it now, well see how it behaves
[12:52] <da1l6> Does anyone know how to disable the paste-selection feature when pressing the scroll whell?
[12:52] <Williamts99> kanzie, I use the bittorrent client that comes with ubuntu, I believe it's called bittorrent
[12:52] <manny0> dang it
[12:52] <Qwerty> lemme recheck dooglus
[12:52] <manny0> i cant figure out how to use unshield
[12:52] <CarinArr> my azureus is currently using about 40MB and that's after running for three days
=== rooter is now known as rootpt
[12:52] <slinky_> Are there any known problems with using the new version of Firefox 2.0 with Dapper-Drake/ubuntu 6.06?
[12:52] <manny0> just says cannot open file
[12:52] <manny0> or something
[12:53] <Qwerty> 30 MB on startup
[12:53] <Qwerty> yeah
[12:53] <kestaz> manny0, try unshield x name.exe
[12:53] <frogzoo> azcazandco: have you considered reinstalling the nautilus package ?
[12:53] <Qwerty> slinky_,  no I guess, no probs yet
[12:53] <Williamts99> slinky, I had no problem when I was running dapper
[12:53] <azcazandco> I am not even convinced it is an error, looks like a settings thing
[12:53] <manny0> failed to open
[12:53] <Kanzie> So is there any way to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy
[12:53] <azcazandco> I can browse the filesystem using terminal so it is not permissions
[12:54] <took77> anybody here who has tryed to make MSI fx5200 work as dualhead?
[12:54] <CarinArr> manny0, well the problem is that .exe could be any sort of windows binary.. often with drivers all it really is is a self extracting zip file which is why just using unzip can work in many cases
[12:54] <cpk1> alright has anyone gotten cdrecord to work who also has a sata drive?
[12:54] <Qwerty> its risky but a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade would do Kanzie
[12:54] <slinky_> well I'll give it a go, oh does it support mpeg and wmv out of the box?
[12:54] <Williamts99> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[12:54] <manny0> dang it
[12:54] <manny0> im screwed
[12:54] <Qwerty> slinky_, erm, nopes? :p WMV is baad
[12:54] <dannis> #ubuntu/-es
[12:54] <frogzoo> slinky_: no, proprietary codecs aren't bundled
[12:54] <CarinArr> manny0, if you take it from the start, does ndiswrapper load the driver okay, does it say the hardware is present?
[12:54] <Kanzie> Qwerty: oh... neh, Im so happy with my machine as it is... no need to update my dist I think
[12:54] <dannis> #ubuntu/es
[12:55] <ReYnoLd_ubaya> _DiRanjang_Yuk
[12:55] <dannis> #ubuntu-es
[12:55] <manny0> the one i used to have long ago
[12:55] <manny0> yes
[12:55] <frogzoo> !codecs > slinky_
[12:55] <sitchin> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31877/
[12:55] <CarinArr> manny0, and when you modprobe ndiswrapper it doesnt' give you any errors
[12:55] <manny0> but that driver is gone
[12:55] <Williamts99> slinky, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[12:55] <manny0> back then i didnt do modprobe
[12:55] <dooglus> sitchin: and now "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get install unrar"
[12:55] <manny0> which is why im thinking after learning about this mod probe stuff
[12:55] <feydin> any one knows a tool to add sound to a existing video?
[12:55] <manny0> in combination with getting that driver inf i could make it work
[12:55] <dannis> help i new in this s.o.
[12:56] <CarinArr> manny0, you need to modprobe ndiswrapper or it will never actually try to use your wireless card
[12:56] <slinky_> Can you purchase a license to use mpeg and wmv from any place or is there a commercially available program that will support them without having to get bad or ugly thingies on my system?
[12:56] <dannis> i dont speak english
[12:56] <manny0> modprobe as in edit those files?
[12:56] <manny0> Type "sudo gedit etc/modprobe.d/blacklist"
[12:56] <manny0> At the bottom add the lines
[12:56] <manny0> # get rid of the default kernel drivers
[12:56] <manny0> blacklist bcm43xx
[12:56] <dannis> hay alguien que hable espaol?
[12:56] <manny0> as in that
[12:57] <nuts7_> hi guys, before I install thunderbird, is there the issue fixed that you cant right click on files on your desktop and make Send to?
[12:57] <CarinArr> manny0, well that's only one step.. do you still have the .inf file you used with ndiswrapper before?
[12:57] <Williamts99> slinky_, all things proprietary are bad and ugly
[12:57] <dannis> #ubuntu.es
[12:57] <manny0> nope
[12:57] <manny0> :(
[12:57] <frogzoo> feydin: apt-cache search video |grep editor
[12:57] <CarinArr> dannis, /join #ubuntu-es
[12:57] <Williamts99> slinky_, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats will get you started though
[12:57] <manny0> i remember my roomate unshielded it before but i forgot the cmd he used
[12:57] <dannis> gracias
[12:58] <CarinArr> manny0, if you get it, and do things step by step maybe we can find out what the problem is
[12:58] <frogzoo> slinky_: the available codecs are neither bad nor ugly, however depending on jurisdiction they may be illegal
[12:59] <slinky_> I know how to install all of that, I was trying to see if those formats can be used legit, by purchasing software for linux environment?
[12:59] <azcazandco> man this is driving me crazy
[12:59] <sitchin> success!
[12:59] <azcazandco> I need to be able to get to my /var/www/ on a regular basis but cant manage
[12:59] <sitchin> it did install thank you dooglus
[01:00] <slinky_> It is my understanding that MS released wmv format to public as a standard, is this true?
[01:00] <CarinArr> azcazandco, you can always use oldfashioned terminals..;)
[01:01] <Williamts99> slinky_, Not sure about purchasing a license to use whatever format, you would have to talk to the copyright holder.
[01:01] <Williamts99> slinky_, I have not heard that, I think you have to own a copy of windows or something like that.
[01:01] <manny0> im going to try and get the inf file
[01:01] <manny0> brb
[01:01] <frogzoo> slinky_: consider Turbolinux
[01:02] <slinky_> thank you Williamts99 for the info, I read it is now part of an ISO
[01:02] <manny0> ahh
[01:02] <manny0> i got em
[01:02] <manny0> with cabextract
[01:02] <Williamts99> slinky_, where did you read this?
[01:02] <slinky_> Turbolinux? geez Williamts99, I think on linux.org but can't recall
[01:03] <manny0> hey carinarr
[01:03] <manny0> ig ot the inf
[01:03] <CarinArr> manny0, good
[01:03] <manny0> bcmwl5.inf and .sys
[01:03] <vick1> im looking to install mplayer to play my .avi files
[01:03] <CarinArr> manny0, okay go to the folder that contains them and run ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf
[01:04] <vick1> the ubuntu site asks me o use synaptic
[01:04] <CarinArr> manny0, you need to do it as sudo
[01:04] <slinky_> Is Turbolinux as good as Slackware :)
[01:04] <manny0> yea
[01:04] <manny0> lol
[01:04] <vick1> synaptic does not show me mplayer
[01:04] <CarinArr> manny0, have you done it?
[01:05] <manny0> ok
[01:05] <manny0> yea
[01:05] <neildarlow> vick1: you'll need to add the PLF repository to your software sources to get w32codecs
[01:05] <CarinArr> manny0, now do ndiswrapper -l
[01:05] <seraphim> !multiverse
[01:05] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
=== _Genrl_Zod is now known as Genrl_Zod
[01:05] <vick1> i got the w32 codecs
[01:05] <CarinArr> does it say the driver and hardware is present?
[01:05] <manny0> is that a L or a 1
[01:05] <vick1> i need mplayer
[01:05] <CarinArr> a small L
[01:05] <seraphim> vick1:
[01:05] <seraphim> !EasySource
[01:05] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic

[01:06] <CarinArr> !pastebin | manny0
[01:06] <ubotu> manny0: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[01:06] <seraphim> look at ubotus last two statements
[01:06] <CarinArr> can you paste exactly what it says>
[01:06] <CarinArr> in pastebin
[01:06] <seraphim> before this one :D
[01:06] <manny0> oh
[01:07] <CarinArr> and also manny0 can you paste the output of "lspci" into pastebin as well?
[01:07] <manny0> whats that
[01:07] <vick1> how do i play avi/mpeg files on ubuntu?
[01:07] <CarinArr> manny0, it will list your pci interfaces
[01:07] <CarinArr> vick1, if you go to http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl/dists/edgy-seveas/all/, add the two lines that it says to your repository
[01:07] <neildarlow> vick1: if you have mplayer and w32codecs installed you should be able to play them
[01:08] <Williamts99> vick1, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats explains it all
[01:08] <CarinArr> vick1, and install the ubuntu-multimedia-gnome metapackage
[01:08] <CarinArr> vick1, you should be good to go
[01:08] <jenda> I'm trying to install mozilla-enigmail, but can't, because it depends on an older version of mozilla-mailnews than seems to be available in the repos
[01:08] <slinky_> Is it possible to play all formats inside Firefox 2.0 without having to use an external program, only plugins?
[01:08] <manny0> ok
[01:08] <manny0> i pasted
[01:08] <manny0> what i did
[01:08] <neildarlow> jenda: can't you install it as an extension?
[01:08] <manny0> do i need to post alink or something
[01:09] <CarinArr> manny0, okay, if you press okay you should have a url for your paste, if you paste that here we can have a look
[01:09] <jenda> nevermind... I want to install mozilla-thunderbird-enigmail
[01:09] <jenda> I tried the wrong package.
[01:09] <Williamts99> slinky_, the mplayer firefox plugin should handle everything that mplayer will handle
[01:09] <vick1> wht does the seveas link do?
[01:09] <jenda> neildarlow: thanks, though.
[01:09] <seraphim> vick1: follow this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu and then install mplayer
[01:09] <manny0> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31881/
[01:10] <folder> Cool. Ubuntu 6.10 is installed on the Thinkpad T41 - via textmode install. Startup was very fast, and my volume up/down keys bring up an unscreen volume up/down display. Sweet :D
[01:10] <vick1> been there
[01:10] <vick1> sera
[01:10] <manny0> is that what you needed?
[01:10] <CarinArr> vick1, it just has a collection of packages that will make life easier
[01:10] <seraphim> and you still can't install mplayer?
[01:10] <slinky_> ok, thank you folks very much for all your help, btw kubuntu desktop trashed my system so I am rebuilding Dapper (only)

[01:11] <Williamts99> slinky_, good luck, have you tried Edgy yet?
[01:11] <seraphim> synaptic...
[01:11] <frogzoo> so could anyone suggest 3 good reasons to upgrade to edgy ?
=== Co_SeXy^FiTnEs_S is now known as Co_Fit^Sex_Sby
[01:11] <CarinArr> okay manny0, can you paste the output of lspci in there too?
[01:11] <manny0> ok hjow i get that
[01:11] <manny0> whats hte cmd
[01:11] <vick1> im on synaptic
[01:11] <slinky_> hehe, I'm a bit Edgy to try Edgy just yet, only new to linux
[01:11] <CarinArr> manny0, the command is "lspci";)
[01:11] <vick1> i dont see mplayer here
[01:11] <seraphim> did you update the list in synaptic? two green arrows top left
[01:12] <neildarlow> frogzoo: windows have rounded corners, there's a human theme for firefox and usplash looks nicer. all essential really :)
[01:12] <seraphim> the last button in this row is search. klick it, search by name and type mplayer
[01:12] <_azrael> frogzoo: most of the people in this channel who help support are on it, so they can help you better, if you have HDA Intel sound card, proper ALSA support gets added, GLX'd by default... I suppose it really depends what you want it to do.
[01:12] <vick1> i have 0.57.8 i dont see two arrows
[01:12] <vick1> yeah tried searching
[01:12] <Williamts99> boots a lot faster too
[01:12] <CarinArr> i have edgy installed on all three of my machines, laptop works perfectly, desktop needed a reinstall after i upgraded as odd things were going on and now it runs fsck every time i reboot, work machine is messed up royally and hangs installing packages
[01:12] <manny0> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31882/
[01:12] <vick1> it shows me kmplayer
[01:12] <manny0> there ya go
[01:12] <seraphim> the version of synaptic doesn't matter
[01:13] <dawynn> how do I clean the trash for files that root has deleted?
[01:13] <vick1> kmplayer-base
[01:13] <vick1> Base files for KMPlayer
[01:13] <Williamts99> Though I don't recomend upgrading, it seems that a fresh install is much better
[01:13] <vick1> is what it shows me
[01:13] <seraphim> there should also be mozilla-mplayer and mplayer
=== ReYnoLd_ubaya is now known as Co_Sby_Fitnes^Se
[01:13] <vick1> nop!
[01:13] <seraphim> and you added all repositories?
[01:13] <CarinArr> manny0, okay, the rest of the stuff i'll ask you to paste you can paste at the bottom of the stuff in "make a correction" so we can see everything you've pasted

[01:14] <manny0> thanks ahead of time man.
[01:14] <Williamts99> neildarlow, no but some have had issues upgrading from dapper to edgy that a fresh install of edgy did not have

[01:18] <vick1> ser help:(
[01:18] <manny0> ok

[01:18] <vick1> why isint mplayer showing in my synaptic
[01:18] <seraphim> be sure you added the multiverse
[01:18] <seraphim> then you will find mplayer
[01:19] <neildarlow> dawynn: probably meant start KDE as root but "you don't want to do that(TM)"
[01:19] <tuskernini> can anyone help with ekiga stun/nat problems

[01:19] <CarinArr> manny0, can you do "lspci -n" as well and paste it in the same pastebin as before?
[01:20] <manny0> damn it
[01:20] <manny0> i cant get itout

[01:21] <davidw> ok.... this is fucked up... it won't boot if ldap is active
[01:21] <davidw> gets stuck on resolvconf
[01:21] <CarinArr> manny0, k.. i'll have a look but meanwhile will you paste the output of "lspci -n" for me? in pastebin?
[01:21] <manny0> and unshield
[01:21] <manny0> ok
[01:21] <dawynn> yeah -- Ubuntu has never let me signon as root.  and konqueror can't seem to do a straight delete -- everything has to go to trash first.  Well, that leaves it on the drive, taking up space.
[01:21] <neildarlow> davidw: has /etc/host.conf got ldap listed before files?
[01:22] <davidw> yeah
[01:22] <seraphim> dawynn: the trash is a hidden directory
[01:22] <davidw> hrm
[01:22] <manny0> ok
[01:22] <manny0> refresh
[01:22] <neildarlow> davidw: bad move, you need to be able to resolve system accounts from passwd etc. first
[01:22] <manny0> hrm

[01:22] <tuskernini> can anyone HELP with EKIGA incall settings?
[01:22] <dawynn> and locked -- and console can't find the 'cd' command if I'm trying to do a sudo.  (sudo cd .Trash-0 doesn't work)
=== rooter is now known as rootpt
[01:22] <davidw> neildarlow, it has 'ldap compat'
[01:23] <davidw> which is as it should be
[01:23] <seraphim> dawynn: for users you find it in /home/user/.Trash
[01:23] <CarinArr> manny0, you have to press "paste it" again;)
[01:23] <folder> cursor keys don't work right in vi in gnome-terminal either
[01:23] <manny0> ok
[01:23] <davidw> it should grab ldap accounts first, and then look at system accounts
[01:23] <neildarlow> davidw: i *never* put ldap first
[01:23] <Kazuhiro> dawynn, /etc/nsswitch.conf have you defined passwd: files ldap etc?
[01:23] <manny0> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31884/
[01:23] <davidw> Kazuhiro, yeah
[01:23] <Kazuhiro> dawynn, hosts:          files dns
[01:23] <davidw> IMO there is something else going on
[01:23] <seraphim> dawynn: roots home is /root
[01:23] <davidw> if I bring the machine up with ldap commented out in nsswitch, everything is ok
[01:24] <davidw> then I can turn it on and everything is dandy
[01:24] <davidw> with ldap, networking doesn't seem to come up...
[01:24] <neildarlow> davidw: yes, bacuse ldap isn't being queried
[01:24] <davidw> and so ldap fails, and everything goes to hell
[01:24] <davidw> (btw, everything worked until attempting to upgrade to edgy eft)
[01:24] <CarinArr> manny0, okay good.. let me see if i can get this exe open
[01:24] <manny0> k
[01:25] <Kazuhiro> do you have a local system user account with sudo access you can test with?
[01:25] <dawynn> yes -- and there is no /root/.Trash
[01:25] <CarinArr> or maybe not quite yet given the download is crawling along at 50k/s
[01:25] <neildarlow> davidw: you need to check that your ldap installation is still sound. use tools like slapcat etc.
[01:25] <Kazuhiro> if it is setup correctly you should be able to log on as them and diagnose
[01:25] <manny0> hehe
[01:25] <davidw> neildarlow, it is... I fixed it up and tested it after logging in with it turned off
[01:25] <davidw> (btw, boot with init=/bin/bash doesn't work anymore either...grrr)
[01:26] <neildarlow> davidw: does Linux single work?
[01:26] <seraphim> dawynn: perhaps you can find it in a terminal with "find / | grep .Trash | grep filename
[01:26] <Kazuhiro> dawynn, did you setup libnss-ldap?
[01:26] <davidw> it didn't last time
[01:26] <davidw> I can try again
[01:26] <seraphim> w/o the "
[01:26] <davidw> Kazuhiro, yes, of course - this all used to work until eft killed it
[01:27] <Kazuhiro> libpam-ldap?
[01:27] <manny0> what kind of seminar?
[01:27] <Kazuhiro> also your /etc/pam.d/common-* files for ldap
[01:27] <Kazuhiro> edgy upgrade may have overwritten some of your configs.
[01:27] <folder> Automatix2 looks OK, but doesn't give me any option to install ATi fglrx stuff
[01:28] <CarinArr> just a departmental one.. i'm forced to give a talk on something graphics related
[01:28] <davidw> Kazuhiro, if I turn ldap off in nsswitch, reboot the machine, and then turn it on, everything works fine
[01:28] <davidw> are you guys using ldap auth in eft?
[01:28] <davidw> (ie.... is it possible, or is it something local I need to loook out for)
[01:28] <CarinArr> davidw, at work, strangely that's the only part of my edgy install at work which works perfectly
[01:28] <davidw> booting single user mode blocks on resolvconf too
[01:29] <davidw> mmm weird
[01:29] <manny0> where you work carinarr
[01:29] <Kazuhiro> davidw, indeed.
[01:29] <CarinArr> manny0, university of bath, doing research
[01:29] <manny0> oh cool
[01:29] <Kazuhiro> davidw, you dont have tls setup on your ldap server do you?
[01:30] <manny0> i work at bestbuy
[01:30] <davidw> Kazuhiro, don't think so
[01:30] <CarinArr> davidw, unfortunately i don't think i can be of any help at all given we all hand the ldap setup to the resident ldap expert and let him get on with it
[01:30] <GnarusLeo> Hi, how do I make amarok transfeer the covers to my ipod as well as the song? I remember I had to compile some cover art thingy or something, but not the exact thing ... can anyone help me?
[01:30] <davidw> my boss doesn't believe in hiring an actual sysadmin...
[01:30] <manny0> u get that exe open?
[01:30] <CarinArr> we have sysadmins but they know nothing and they try to force us to use suse
[01:30] <manny0> cuz i donno what els to do with it besides look at it
[01:30] <CarinArr> manny0, still downloading;)
[01:30] <CarinArr> 70%
[01:30] <manny0> oh
[01:31] <manny0> lol
[01:31] <Kazuhiro> davidw, make sure the following packages are configured, i suspect the upgrade has changed a configuration file.
[01:31] <manny0> on a side note my ubuntu is themed after mac OSX
[01:31] <Kazuhiro> davidw, libpam-ldap, libnss-ldap
[01:31] <CarinArr> they also failed to install my graphics card completely and utterly, which i had patience with for three months until i insisted on managing my own machine
[01:32] <davidw> Kazuhiro, yes, I went and looked at those and fixed them
[01:32] <ey> hello i got problem with this crap :S or myabe i am to stupid to understand this ->
[01:32] <ey> semboy@SigurNafnjesu:~/mappa$ ls -l

[01:32] <CarinArr> suffice to say the resident ldap expert isn't one of the sysadmins;)
[01:33] <ey> why does the r give me so long
[01:33] <ey> i just want the r to be .at the start
[01:33] <ey> like dr*
[01:33] <manny0> i wnat a cool rss feeder on my desktop :(
[01:33] <ey> when i do chmod 4 i get d------r--
[01:33] <ey> why?
[01:33] <manny0> to be cool i guess
[01:33] <davidw> Kazuhiro, nope

[01:35] <CarinArr> oni-dracula, i've got my wifi working on both my home machines but whenever i use network-admin it just messes things up
[01:36] <CarinArr> or rather it doesn't really do anything at all
[01:36] <Oni-Dracula> CarinArr, any recommendations on what to use for finding local wifi networks?
[01:36] <CarinArr> oni-dracula, i've resorted to just using iwconfig.. iwlist scan will show you a list of available networks

[01:40] <Kazuhiro> davidw, http://mcwhirter.com.au/node/25
[01:41] <Kazuhiro> davidw, see the comments there, possibly nsswitch is trying to connect to the ldap server at boot time before networking is up.
[01:41] <fyrestrtr> ey: http://catcode.com/teachmod/
[01:42] <ey> carinarr correct me please
[01:42] <ey> what is wrong with this 420
[01:42] <Kazuhiro> davidw, another reference for you to read http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1719826
[01:42] <ucordes> can i connect to 2 networks at the same time?
[01:42] <denny> if any ops see this, could they /msg me please - thanks
[01:42] <CarinArr> ey, i'm not going to sit here and explain the workings of chmod toyou when there are manuals.
[01:42] <fyrestrtr> ucordes: yes.
[01:43] <Kazuhiro> ucordes, yes you can, your routing may need to be manually tweaked
[01:43] <CarinArr> ey, plus we don't actually know what you're wanting to dow ith chmod
[01:44] <ucordes> Kazuhiro: what you mean by tweak my routing? i am connected to one network with lan and i want to connect to another network with wifi. so with two different interfaces. will this be possible?
[01:44] <fyrestrtr> ucordes: yes, just setup your network cards properly, I don't see what's the prob?
[01:44] <Kazuhiro> yeah, are they on different network ranges?
[01:44] <fyrestrtr> ey: go read the link I gave you. It will explain unix permissions to you.
[01:45] <ucordes> Kazuhiro. i think they both use 192.168.0.*
[01:45] <Oni-Dracula> holy crap
[01:45] <Oni-Dracula> everyone drop what you're doing.
[01:45] <ey> Carinarr i am reading from a bk .I AM LEARning about linux .and it says in the book do this " drw-r--r-- "
[01:45] <Oni-Dracula> i just got my sony clie to sync with gnome-pilot

[01:46] <Oni-Dracula> it's a miracle!
[01:46] <CarinArr> ey, then the book likely tells you how to as well
[01:46] <Kazuhiro> ucordes, then this will be "screwy"
[01:46] <ucordes> Oni-Dracula: congratulations
[01:46] <Kazuhiro> this = things
[01:46] <fyrestrtr> ey: have you read the next page?
[01:46] <dooglus> ey: if you want to see the numbers, read "man 2 chmod"
[01:46] <Oni-Dracula> I am very very happy with edgy...got wifi and pilot sync working when it didn't in dapper.  Now if anyone could help getting the side buttons on my razer diamondback working...

[01:47] <ucordes> Oni-Dracula: oh i see. what does uber mean?
[01:47] <Oni-Dracula> ucordes, it has 7 buttons, two standard, one middle, and four side buttons
[01:48] <fyrestrtr> Oni-Dracula: just set it up like any multi-button mouse.
[01:48] <dooglus> ey: the easiest way to get what you want is:  chmod u=rw,go=r file
[01:49] <Oni-Dracula> fyrestrtr, I tried it...but the button detection is funky in edgy....  I had to swap the buttons to read "1 3 2 6 7" in xorg.conf
[01:49] <ucordes> Oni-Dracula: what is uber now?
[01:49] <ey> dooglus i just got it ! thanks man!! hehe i forgott to do 4+2 = 6 :)

[01:50] <mamzers555> hi, how to change spell-checking in xchat?
[01:51] <mamzers555> can somebody help me please?
[01:51] <fyrestrtr> mamzers555: try asking in #xchat
[01:51] <mamzers555> fry
[01:51] <mamzers555> fyrestrtr; i'll try thanks
[01:52] <[GuS] > Hello | Hola | Bonjour :P
[01:52] <Oni-Dracula> innit a text file?
[01:52] <seraphim> mamzers555: right-klick on the field, "entering-method" (bad translated ;) ) -> x
[01:52] <seraphim> seems to work for me
[01:52] <wolfman_za> hello, anyone aware of a SSO (Single Sign-On) application for Linux desktops? Basically something that will detect a password prompt and then autocomplete the fields using cached credentials
[01:53] <mamzers555> seraphim; i want to change the language the will be checked
[01:53] <valehru> is there a how to on how I can install java sdk and plugin on edgy 64?
[01:53] <fyrestrtr> wolfman_za: erm, that's not single sign on :) SSO is when you enter one set of credentials and it authenticates you to multiple services.
[01:53] <seraphim> oh...k, #xchat :D
[01:54] <finalbeta> mamzers555, I think it only wants to check the systems default language. Like most programs (gaim etc) do.
[01:54] <waylandbill> wolfman_za, public/private keys?
[01:54] <wolfman_za> fyrestrtr: I was afraid to ask, exactly for that reason :-)
[01:54] <finalbeta> Most people use multiple languages on the net, but when I raised the issue it was deemed not important
[01:54] <fyrestrtr> wolfman_za: kerberos is one way, ldap is another, and some PKI infrastructure is yet another way.
[01:55] <wolfman_za> waylandbill: I'm looking for something that can detect various apps' password prompts and then replay the cached credentials
[01:55] <mamzers555> finalbeta; so this cannot be changed, except changeing the system language?
[01:55] <seraphim> so more people have to ask for it :)
[01:55] <fyrestrtr> wolfman_za: what kind of apps?
[01:55] <wolfman_za> fyrestrtr: any KDE/GTK apps
[01:55] <finalbeta> mamzers555, as far as I know, yes. But perhaps the people in #xchat can still help you.
[01:55] <fyrestrtr> mamzers555: find out what dictionary xchat uses, then add the appropriate language file for it. That should take you one step further.
[01:56] <waylandbill> wolfman_za, ok. my first thought was remote services.
[01:56] <mamzers555> finalbeta; i tryed, but didn't find it out
[01:56] <wolfman_za> fyrestrtr: yep, I'm aware of Kerberos, etc - only problem is that you need to have those apps support (PAM, Krb, etc)
[01:56] <mamzers555> finalbeta; sorry
[01:56] <mamzers555> fyrestrtr; i tried, i think it is useing gtkspell which depends on aspell
[01:57] <fyrestrtr> wolfman_za: what are looking for would be tough to find -- but it is available on a large scale. Oracle has an application that does *partly* what you ask. I just spoke to their VP on it yesterday.
[01:57] <mamzers555> fyrestrtr; but aspell in installed with the language i want
[01:57] <fyrestrtr> mamzers555: I think its best you take it to #xchat as this is not a ubuntu issue.
[01:58] <wolfman_za> fyrestrtr: yep - I use a RSA Sign-On manager (which they call a SSO app) to the same thing on windows...
[01:58] <bayzider> Can some one help me install itunes using wine. When I try and intstall it it always says that it failed ot install quick time.
[01:58] <fyrestrtr> wolfman_za: yeah, they have something similar to that in their fusion middleware line, but sadly -- it doesn't have a mac client.
[01:58] <finalbeta> fyrestrtr, I disagree it not being an ubuntu issue in general, but ok.
[01:59] <fyrestrtr> finalbeta: this is an official ubuntu support channel, so we try to keep it as on-topic as we can. There is #xchat, #linuxhelp and #ubuntu-offtopic for other stuff.
[01:59] <dooglus> firefox 2.0 will underline my spelling misstakes in red, but can I get it to make suggestions of how the word should be spelled?

[01:59] <dooglus> finalbeta: xchat isn't part of ubuntu even, it's in universe, so how can this be a ubuntu issue?
[02:00] <finalbeta> dooglus, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ConsolidateSpellingLibs

[02:10] <feydin> anyone know how to fix this?
[02:10] <crimsun> it's not compiled with mp3 support.
[02:10] <co_op_er> dorto: let's change your alsa mixer to oss mixer, or vice versa
[02:11] <feydin> crimsun, the he would tell me, he didn't find that song... wouldn't he?
[02:11] <crimsun> dorto: "suddenly"?
[02:11] <crimsun> feydin: no idea, I'm only looking at the source
[02:11] <co_op_er> i don' know, just try it
[02:12] <feydin> crimsun, but i can play mp3 songs with amarok very well
[02:12] <davidw> Kazuhiro, perfect, that link explains everything... I knew it had to be more than just a config issue
[02:12] <crimsun> feydin: libxine-extracodecs doesn't have anything to do with libmusicbrainz
[02:13] <dorto> co_op_er, changed in Preferences->Sound but no affect
[02:13] <brynk> are there any good alternatives for mpd?
[02:13] <dorto> crimsun, it was working some days ago. after a reboot, the speaker was muted and when I unmuted it, the sound was still not playing
[02:13] <dorto> I was able to play ogg, mp3, wav everything earlier
[02:14] <feydin> crimsun, so there's no way to install libmusicbrainz with the packet manager? i need to build it myself?

[02:16] <feydin> crimsun, rebuild it from source? or with packet manager? sorry im not soo deep into it :)
[02:16] <co_op_er> or maybe other apps use your sound server
[02:16] <crimsun> dorto: does it finish?
[02:16] <dorto> the command terminated after some time
[02:16] <dorto> yes

[02:25] <dooglus> livingdaylight: thunderbird is pretty crappy, I wouldn't recommend using it to anyone
[02:25] <livingdaylight> but i need an email client with Calendar functionality, hence Kontact
[02:25] <defrysk> kmail is very good
[02:25] <Williamts99> linvingdaylight, as a matter of fact, I was
[02:25] <Williamts99> :-)
[02:25] <livingdaylight> dooglus, everyone has a different opinion. What do you use then? Please do not say Evolution
[02:26] <beo> I use evolution and I like it
[02:26] <depi> dooglus: easy is also to connect to FTp through nautilus, but then I cant see the FTP from eclipse :( from for example gedit I see it very well
[02:26] <livingdaylight> Williamts99, hahahahaha, you're a funny guy, LOL
[02:26] <CarinArr> i'm lost without pine
[02:26] <dooglus> livingdaylight: I do currently use evolution, but only because I've not found anything better yet.  I've tried kmail and thunderbird, but neither one made me as happy as evolution.
[02:26] <livingdaylight> Williamts99, i REALLY believe you, hohoho

[02:31] <shadeofgrey> runp:  have you already made the artistic assets you neeed?
[02:31] <runpain> yes i created the icons for windoz
[02:31] <runpain> how do i convert them
[02:31] <shadeofgrey> that doesnt matter.. icons in ubuntu are a completely different animal
[02:31] <runpain> o
[02:31] <howang> co_op_er, what do you mean by "similar packages"?
[02:32] <XiXaQ> dooglus, ok. I haven't really checked it out, because I'm very happy with Evolution. Thought maybe livingdaylight might like it though.
[02:32] <beo> with the gnome dektop why cant I access the gpart or other system tools, let alone set up the education program group under the applications menu

[02:32] <runpain> thats kool
[02:32] <livingdaylight> XiXaQ, you know livingdaylight may like it :D but version 0.3 is not very reassuring - early days yet, huh?
[02:32] <howang> I've install autoconf, automake, gcc
[02:32] <livingdaylight> but looks promising
[02:33] <xenium> why is it that by default hosts is configured that the $hostname is pointing to 127.0.1.1 instead of 127.0.0.1 ?
[02:34] <dooglus> howang: did you install build-essential?
[02:35] <Netziro> xenium:  generally localhost is pointed to 127.0*
[02:35] <Netziro> is lo interface
[02:36] <Netziro> is used to local programs...
[02:36] <howang> dooglus, that's works! but I come to another problem... I need "lex" but apt-get install lex didn't work
[02:37] <xenium> Netziro yes ... i know ... usually 127.0.0.1 .. but why is hostname pointing to 127.0.0.1 ?
[02:37] <dooglus> howang: it's called 'flex' in the free world
[02:37] <howang> dooglus, and yywrap
[02:37] <dooglus> howang: you can fix all these problems at once if you add deb-src sources to your sources.list and use apt-get build-dep
[02:37] <keur> Someone runs root-tail on ubuntu gnome??
[02:38] <dooglus> howang: someone packages php for ubuntu already.  in doing so, they had to work out all the dependencies.  you can "apt-get build-dep php5" or some such to install all the build dependencies
[02:38] <dooglus> keur: I used to work on root-tail a bit.  I don't use it any more though.
[02:39] <Netziro> because some apps uses hostname and not local ip ..... so needed to point $hostname to local ip
[02:39] <keur> dooglus: it worked for you with gnome?
=== ReYnoLd_ubaya is now known as Male_Fitnes_Sby
[02:39] <dooglus> keur: I don't run nautilus, so yes.  I'm not sure if it ever worked with nautilus running
[02:39] <Crescendo> How do I mount an ISO from the command line...?
[02:40] <Netziro> $hostname isn't host "hostname" , $hostname is a var content the name of localhost :)
[02:40] <Terminus> Crescendo: mount -t iso9660 -o loop foo.iso /mount/point
[02:40] <Crescendo> Thanks.
[02:40] <dooglus> Crescendo: sudo mount -o loop file.iso /mnt/point
[02:40] <Crescendo> Couldn't remember exactly.
[02:40] <Crescendo> :P
[02:40] <Netziro> example if u named ur machine "ubuntu" $hostname become "ubuntu"
[02:41] <Netziro> then some apps use var $hostname ... so apps know $hostname is localmachine
[02:41] <howang> dooglus, problems keep coming.... E: Could not open file /var/lib/apt/lists/hk.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_main_source_Sources - open (2 No such file or directory)
[02:41] <howang> dooglus, when I run the build-dep cmd
[02:42] <keur> dooglus: that's the point, it seems to run for me but doesn't show up on my desktop so i'm stuck ...you don't use it anymore,you have something else?
[02:42] <xenium> Netziro true i'm just saying that if u name your machine ubuntu for example it will be linked in hosts to 127.0.1.1 instead of 127.0.0.1 ... i noticed it by the apache start message apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
[02:42] <dxdemetriou> anybody knows how comes on Edgy when I start the nautilus as root or after crash, to start several windows with the home folder?
[02:42] <Netziro> maybe on file /etc/hosts
[02:42] <Netziro> u have configured 127.0.1.1
[02:43] <whyameye> does Dapper use udev or hotplug?
[02:43] <dooglus> keur: I used to use a dual-monitor setup, with root-tail running on one of the monitors, but now I only use one monitor, and generally run things full-screen
[02:43] <Netziro> then you have to change it in 127.0.0.1
[02:43] <xenium> Netziro ... right its configured like that by default to 127.0.0.1
[02:43] <dooglus> howang: add 'deb-src' sources to sources.list and update first
[02:43] <xenium> i mean 127.0.1.1 <<< thats why i was wondering
[02:43] <howang> how?
[02:43] <Netziro> cool then u have to change it on 127.0.0.1
[02:43] <xenium> why not 127.0.0.1
[02:44] <Netziro> cuz on installation processes... ubuntu sets host to 127.0.1.1
[02:44] <keur> dooglus: ok and for watching your logs, did you find something else?
[02:44] <Netziro> maybe it's a little error
[02:44] <dooglus> howang: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and for each line starting with "deb ", make a corresponding identical line, only starting with "deb-src "
[02:44] <xenium> so question is more about ... is this a bug ? should i file a bug at launchpad ?
[02:44] <dooglus> keur: I stopped watching my logs...  or "tail -f" works when I want to watch them.
[02:44] <Netziro> it's only a little error
[02:44] <howang> dooglus, no gedit installed
[02:45] <howang> dooglus, how about vim
[02:45] <i0null> None of the usb ports on my ubuntu edgy work
[02:45] <dooglus> howang: sudo nano?  sudo vi?  sudo emacs?  sudo vim, yes, whatever...
[02:45] <Netziro> u can change it.. and allthings go on!
[02:45] <i0null> aprt form the mouse
[02:45] <i0null> apart*
[02:45] <xenium> Netziro ... true its a minor one ... nobody will really suffer from it ... but for polishing ?
[02:45] <howang> I'm already on a root shell :p
[02:45] <xenium> its in dapper and edgy that way
[02:45] <dxdemetriou> on shell scripts can I use something like the %I, but to see also files with spaces?
[02:46] <runpain> shade that sure is a long cig LOL
[02:46] <keur> dooglus: yes but it's not as interactive as root-tail....and you cant monitor all the logs in the same time
[02:46] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: "%I"?
[02:46] <dooglus> keur: tail -f can monitor more than one file at a time
[02:46] <Netziro> i'm sure on next version of ubuntu will be corrected
[02:46] <xenium> !hosts
[02:46] <dooglus> keur: and root-tail is completely non-interactive isn't it?
[02:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hosts - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:47] <Netziro> for polishing isn't a problem i think
[02:47] <xenium> !host
[02:47] <ubotu> host: utility for querying DNS servers. In component universe, is extra. Version 20000331-9 (edgy), package size 69 kB, installed size 168 kB
[02:47] <Netziro> u should have 2 lines like that 127.0.0.1 localhost phoenix
[02:47] <Netziro> 127.0.1.1 phoenix
[02:47] <Netziro> u can del second line
[02:47] <JuJuBee> Is there a program I can install in a classroom that will allow me to controll the workstations from my desk (share screen, lock screen, shutdown/restart etc...)?
[02:47] <xenium> yeah mostly ... i guess u changed 127.0.0.1 localhost  to 127.0.0.1 localhost phoenix
[02:48] <keur> dooglus: as i never ran it i dont exactly know but i thought you could see all your logs live-scrolling on your desktop  :))
[02:48] <Netziro> yes.. i've added phoenix .. is my machine name
[02:48] <dooglus> JuJuBee: "vino" is already installed on the clients I expect.  you need "vncviewer" on the server
[02:48] <Netziro> after localhost
[02:48] <xenium> Netziro besides I'm aware of how hosts works ... I'm just wondering if that was an error
[02:48] <cinnander> Hey guys
[02:48] <Netziro> so localhost and phoenix pointed to 127.0.0.1
[02:48] <dooglus> keur: you can, yes.  but it's not interactive - you just watch it, like TV
[02:49] <mc44> #ubuntu-devel
[02:49] <cinnander> Just installed [x] ubuntu and i have to say, it r sechsy.
[02:49] <Netziro> yes it was a little error from ubuntu developpment.
[02:49] <dxdemetriou> dooglus, sorry, I thought about the $URI on nautilus. is the script for mount isos, but doesn't work with files that have spaces. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31905/
[02:49] <Williamts99> jujubee, yes, you can use VNC to view the screen, and you can use ssh to shutdown/restart, etc
[02:49] <i0null> is there any reason why my usb port would not work after a brand new installation of edgy?
[02:49] <i0null> ports*
[02:49] <umops> Does anyone know of a GUI front end for dhcp3-server?
[02:50] <keur> dooglus: by interactive i was meaning it scrolls in live :)
[02:50] <xenium> Netziro ok ... should be pointed out somewhere thou ... elseways same error will continue to slip in the next releases
[02:50] <xenium> its in dapper and edgy already
[02:50] <xenium> don't know about breezy
[02:51] <jenda> My left alt key stopped working after install of XGL, Beryl etc.. I use xmodmap. This is the xev output of the key. PLease help :) http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31908/
[02:51] <Netziro> don't worry
[02:51] <Netziro> edgy is the develop of dapper....
[02:51] <runpain> iam a christian and want to make a set of swords and other icons that are christian for my mouse
[02:51] <Netziro> and actual edgy isn't the definitive

[02:52] <Netziro> not critical
[02:52] <runpain> will some one help me please step by step
[02:52] <Netziro> but like the one u find with host
[02:52] <mc__> is there something like daemon tools for linux?
[02:52] <Netziro> on the next realease
[02:52] <xenium> jenda ... if u are in gnome add the keyboard indicator to the panel and adjust your keyboard all will be fine after
[02:52] <Netziro> 71000 bugs will be corrected
[02:52] <jenda> xenium: nope - I use a custom keyboard, defined through xmodmap
[02:52] <Netziro> all little bugs
[02:52] <runpain> also want to make a spinner for fire fox
[02:53] <xenium> XGL is thou bracking more then doing so u might rethink your need of XGL ... AIGLX is way better ... still thou somthing in early dev
[02:53] <mc__> is it possible to create a virtual cd drive out of a iso?
[02:53] <runpain> is it
[02:53] <mc__> so that i can use it as the cd-drive in vmware
[02:53] <jenda> xenium: besides... it doesn't work
[02:53] <runpain> i would like to know too
[02:53] <xenium> jenda ... don't know then ... but the gnome-keyboard-indicator thingy worked allways for me
[02:53] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: how about this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31909/
[02:53] <jenda> xenium: just tried, it doesn't do anything
[02:54] <incorrect> is subversion 1.4 packaged anywhere?
[02:54] <xenium> jenda
[02:54] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: interactive means that you can interact with it.  "tail -f" scrolls 'in live' too, just in a terminal
[02:54] <xenium> go into the configuration
[02:54] <runpain> mc if you find out let me know
[02:54] <xenium> and set your keyboard to generic 105 key keyboard
[02:54] <valehru_server> Is there any nice overclocking tools available in ubuntu for AMD 64?
[02:55] <xenium> incorrect: yes in debian
[02:55] <mc__> runpain, alright
[02:55] <jenda> xenium: done
[02:55] <jenda> xenium: doesn't seem to help
[02:55] <dooglus> mc__: just mount the .iso file somewhere using "sudo mount -o loop file.iso /mnt/point"
[02:55] <incorrect> xenium: does it work ;)
[02:55] <mc__> dooglus, that is not what i want,i cant use /mnt/point as a dvd drive in vmware
[02:55] <valehru_server> Is anyone else having a serious problem with the splash screen appearing in monochrome and flickering while booting the machine?  Looks terrible...
[02:56] <xenium> jenda: strange ... usually its helping

[03:01] <sidewalk`> im having problems getting my wireless card working under Ubuntu
[03:01] <Williamts99> gnarusleo, http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[03:01] <sidewalk`> i have an acer aspire 502x
[03:01] <dooglus> JuJuBee: you'll need to go to each of the client machines and set up "desktop sharing" or whatever it's called.  you'll see it somewhere in the 3rd menu but I forget where.
[03:01] <genic> sidewalk`, what type?
[03:01] <sidewalk`> im using latest ubuntu
[03:01] <Williamts99> gnarusleo, just remember that it is in beta :-)
[03:01] <genic> what kind of chipsetis using?
[03:01] <sidewalk`> currently it seems to be a broadcom 4318
[03:02] <sidewalk`> i dont think that the problem is the card and the driver
[03:02] <sidewalk`> i think it has found it
[03:02] <sidewalk`> problem is, the light in the pane, doesnt shine
[03:02] <tasha_> hi does anyone know of an alternative to serpentine for creating wav/isos from mp3s?
[03:02] <genic> iwconfig -a is saying something?
[03:02] <sidewalk`> i need some kind of a driver, to turn on the light, cause it turns on
[03:02] <dooglus> tasha_: I expect "mencoder" can do it.
[03:02] <sidewalk`> yeah, iwconfig -a finds the card
[03:03] <genic> ah ok
[03:03] <sidewalk`> but i need to turn on the card
[03:03] <jenda> xenium: nevermind... an X restart fixed it... dunno why, though.
[03:03] <sidewalk`> and i somehow cant do that
[03:03] <genic> i duno how u could turn on the light
[03:03] <tasha_> dooglus: i was hoping for an allinone gui
[03:03] <sidewalk`> and ive tried acer_acpi before, but it doesnt seem to work
[03:04] <runpain> about the iso issue how you do it
[03:05] <sidewalk`> any hint on how i get the card working?
[03:05] <dooglus> tasha_: I don't know, sorry
[03:05] <runpain> as well i have 2wire wireless card and dont know how to install driver to wrapper
[03:05] <runpain> i have drivers
[03:05] <tasha_> dooglus: ta
[03:08] <runpain> so you see i need help first with 2wire wireless card then how to use iso files after that make a cursor set for any one to use that is a christian anyone ready for a challange like me
[03:09] <runpain> :P
[03:09] <lukkystarr> I am doing a dual boot install with the only HD already partitioned.  When I get to the window that asks me to prepare the mount points, I pick one of the ext3 partitions for the root file system, '/' and I already have the swap partition turned on.  I try to go fwd and it gives me an error at the bottom of the window 'no root file system'.  Any suggestions?
[03:10] <sidewalk`> oh hell, i got it working
[03:10] <HarravanS> you have to delete and recreate the partition. Once i resolved the problem in this way
[03:12] <lukkystarr> k, trying that.  why would it need to do that?  (it's a rhetorical Q)
[03:12] <lukkystarr> it worked
[03:12] <lukkystarr> odd
[03:13] <runpain> will some one halp me please
[03:13] <lukkystarr> thanks harravan
[03:13] <meng> even FC6 also had the same thing
[03:13] <HarravanS> ok
[03:13] <runpain> i need step by step
[03:13] <valehru_server> What do you call the image that appears when Ubuntu is starting up?  It has a large Ubuntu Image in text when booting up the PC.
[03:14] <meng> bootsplash
[03:14] <runpain> splashy
[03:14] <Oni-Dracula> actually thats a good question
[03:14] <dxdemetriou> dooglus, it works. thanks. do you know a good place to find scripts to learn?
[03:14] <valehru_server> meng, runpain, is it normal that it would be black and white from a default edgy installation?  Its monochrome right now....and it flickers...does not look nice
[03:14] <Oni-Dracula> is it actually splashy implemented in edgy?
[03:15] <meng> <valehru_server> meng, runpain, is it normal that it would be black and white from a default edgy installation?  Its monochrome right now....and it flickers...does not look nice --> i am still stuck with the RC orange
[03:15] <runpain> splashywell i took the message file out of the folder
[03:15] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: I don't, no.  "man bash" is too dense for learning from, but I don't know any good tutorials.  google will probably find some though.
[03:15] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: or ask in #bash I guess
[03:16] <valehru_server> meng, well it has appeared monochrome on two machines i have installed with edgy, both are x64 machines, never had the problem with x86
[03:16] <ucordes> how can i prevent my ubuntu from beeing seen by windows boxes?
[03:16] <dxdemetriou> dooglus, ok. I try to search for now. thanks :)
[03:16] <ucordes> ... without deactivating smb. i still want to see the windows boxes
[03:17] <sasdsd> hi im upgrading to edgy eft. :)
[03:18] <wutison> good for you
[03:18] <wutison> :P)
[03:18] <dooglus> ucordes: you don't need smbd to browse the network
[03:18] <valehru_server> meng, seems that there is a bug for it.  https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/usplash/+bug/67545
[03:18] <dooglus> ucordes: smbd is only for making yourself visible on the network

[03:20] <runpain> ok i see
[03:20] <runpain> i have a fine boot
[03:21] <runpain> i just removed the message file nad changed time to 5 sec
[03:21] <sasdsd> upgrading will take me 10 hours lol. having a slow connection is really giving me problems
[03:22] <ucordes> dooglus: so i can deactivate smb and still see and browse the windows networks? how can i do so?
[03:22] <Toma-> sasdsd: order a cd for free or buy one for like $2
[03:22] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: I just noticed - you've gone to the trouble of looping over all selected files in that script, but then you try to mount them all on the same mount point!
[03:22] <valehru_server> Oni-Dracula, I don't think they are using splashy in ubuntu.  they use bogl right now......seems to be screwed up on my machine.
[03:22] <dooglus> ucordes: is there some script in /etc/init.d/ called 'smb' or 'smbd' or some such?
[03:23] <ucordes> let me have a look
[03:23] <dooglus> ucordes: if so, just "sudo /etc/init.d/smbd stop" to stop smbd.  you should still be able to browse as before, but now you're not on the windows network yourself
[03:23] <Oni-Dracula> valehru_server, i see... I was just wondering in case there was some customization to be had
=== ReYnoLd_ubaya is now known as Co_Fitnes_Sby
[03:23] <dxdemetriou> dooglus, do you mean if I try to mount multiple files with the script?
[03:24] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: if you select multiple files in nautilus and invoke this script on them all,it will loop ovwer them, mounting each in turn, yes.
[03:24] <dxdemetriou> dooglus, it is only for one each time I want it
[03:24] <mamzers555> how to disable join/part-message permanently in xchat?
[03:24] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: so you don't need to loop part at all

[03:25] <dooglus> ucordes: the reason I don't know its name is that I don't even have it installed, yet I use windows shares all the time...
[03:26] <dooglus> umops: can you connect to it from other hosts?
[03:26] <ucordes> dooglus: i see
[03:26] <dxdemetriou> dooglus, it is easier now. if I needed the loop part is something like the cases in C?

[03:34] <sasdsd> lol im clueless
[03:35] <umops> thanks Netziro and dooglus I will try a few things, its actually acting a little strange
[03:35] <StephenL> When I do an apt-get dist-upgrade I have 29 packages that are kept back.  How can I get rid of those packages showing up every time I update?  It's done this since I upgraded to edgy.
[03:36] <StephenL> They are all python-something
[03:36] <DeeTahPanLtah> StephenL: kept back?
[03:36] <StephenL> "The following packages have been kept back:"
[03:36] <DeeTahPanLtah> no clue ;d
[03:37] <StephenL> and when I do the gui upgrade it lists all those packages
[03:37] <depi> how can I mount ftp fit curltftpfs as a normal user?
[03:37] <depi> *fit=with
[03:37] <giupy_> they're kept back sinxe they're new versions, not upgrade
[03:38] <brynk> StephenL: there seems to be a difference between using the update manager and apt-get update, i had some troubles with that
[03:38] <giupy_> so you have to install them manually
[03:38] <brynk> try both
[03:39] <liestas> hi. how to add times new roman into openoffice?
[03:39] <StephenL> It says they are "distribution updates" in update-manager.
[03:39] <giupy_> apt-get install msttcorefonts
[03:39] <Vuen> hey guys, if i have two linux installations on the same computer, is it safe for both of them to share the same swap partition?
[03:39] <Williamts99> Vuen, Yes
[03:39] <howang> liestas, you need to copy it from a windows pc :/
[03:39] <desertpizza> I'm going to try ubuntu on a partion of my disk, I have Windows XP installed, and i wounder how i uninstall it if i don't like it???, is it just to formate the partion??
[03:39] <[maTa] > i have vodafone hsdpa usb modem and i connect with umts but my download is 15k ( like isdn )...how to get faster connection? need to patch serial-usb.c with different maxspeed or other easyer way?
[03:40] <StephenL> It won't allow me to select them to upgrade them.
[03:40] <depi> how can i mount FS with FUSE as a normal user?
[03:40] <Vuen> Williamts99: are you sure? doesn't it use the swap partition to hibernate?
[03:40] <DeeTahPanLtah> desertpizza: uinstalling ubuntu or windows xp? ;P
[03:40] <desertpizza> ubuntu
[03:40] <[maTa] > anyone?
[03:40] <liestas> giupy_:  thanks
[03:41] <abuyazan> hello
[03:41] <raghu206> is there a text editor which can be faster than gedit
[03:41] <giupy_> u're welcome
[03:41] <abuyazan> i just installed ubuntu
[03:41] <giupy_> Stephen: do you use synaptic?
[03:41] <abuyazan> but it did not asked me about the root password
[03:41] <jrib> raghu206: vim or nano maybe?
[03:41] <ph8> hi all, my sound's not working - even after reboot - can anyone give me a hint as to how to even start diagnosing this? - it's worked for a long time before now
[03:41] <StephenL> giupy_: Yes.
[03:41] <abuyazan> and i am trying to login su - ? what should be the pass
[03:41] <Williamts99> Vuen, I have never looking into that because I don't use hibernate.
[03:42] <raghu206> jrib, i need graphical editor
[03:42] <desertpizza> I'm going to try ubuntu on a partion of my disk, I have Windows XP installed, and i wounder how i uninstall it if i don't like it???, is it just to formate the partion??
[03:42] <giupy_> sthepenL what do you mean wih I can't select them?
[03:42] <genic> does anyone knows something about the new Intel soundcards?
[03:42] <genic> Intel Corp. 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High Definition Audio Controller
[03:42] <genic> i cant get it work
[03:42] <jrib> raghu206: gvim is graphical but maybe you want something like leafpad?
[03:42] <fribuntu> desertpizza: Not quite. You have to get rid of the bootmanager, too.
[03:42] <StephenL> giupy_: in update manager it lists those 29 packages but they are grayed out and I can't select them to upgrade.
[03:42] <raghu206> jrib, leafpad ?
[03:43] <mseney> got it to work yay! edited /etc/network/interfaces (added lines "auto eth2" and "iface eth2 inet dhcp") then ran $sudo ifup -a
[03:43] <jrib> !info leafpad
[03:43] <ubotu> leafpad: GTK+ based simple text editor. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.8.9-2 (edgy), package size 69 kB, installed size 488 kB
[03:43] <fribuntu> desertpizza: Why don't you just try the live version? You don't have to install anything for it. Just shove in the CD and boot.
[03:43] <StephenL> abuyazan: sudo -i
[03:43] <Williamts99> desertpizza, pretty much, but you will have to restore the bootmanager from windows, pretty simple using the windows install disk to repair it.
[03:44] <desertpizza> ok
[03:44] <giupy_> Stephen: have you try to manually apt-get install name_of_the_package
[03:44] <jrib> StephenL: some of the python packages changed name.  Search for similar packages and see if they are installed.  Then you can just remove those old ones
[03:45] <baastrup> hi, when i plug my logitech G5 usb mouse it dossent work, do I have to set something op, my touchpad is working fine
[03:45] <ph8> desertpizza: try the liveCD
[03:45] <[maTa] > i have vodafone hsdpa usb modem and i connect with umts but my download is 15k ( like isdn )...how to get faster connection? need to patch serial-usb.c with different maxspeed or other easyer way?
[03:45] <StephenL> giupy_: yes, it works
[03:45] <StephenL> jrib: Ok.  All of these packages are python packages.
[03:45] <umops> dooglus, Netziro:  I am still having problems, i cannot start the daemon with .../sshd start
[03:46] <giupy_> good stephen
[03:46] <brynk> umops: try dpkg -l | grep openssh-server
[03:46] <abuyazan> StephenL:  then i did not used sudo before
[03:47] <Williamts99> desertpizza, which is a good thing that you want to try it by installing it, it is a much better experence, also might want to check out easyubuntu
[03:47] <umops> brynk, it is there
[03:47] <Oni-Dracula> don't you just love it when people give bad instructions...makes things very difficult
[03:47] <dooglus> umops: what does sshd start tell you?
[03:47] <umops> sudo: /etc/init.d/sshd: command not found
[03:48] <dooglus> umops: it's "sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart"
[03:48] <eracc> Greetings all. My ISP's USENET server has been down since Monday and I'm having USENET withdrawal. Anyone know some good, free USENET servers that allow read AND post? I could not care less about binaries I just want into the Linux and Unix text groups.
[03:48] <StephenL> abuyazan: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[03:48] <jrib> eracc: google groups
[03:48] <dooglus> depi: did you figure it out?
[03:49] <eracc> Oh, I already know about Google Groups, jrib. I will not use it.
[03:49] <Williamts99> Vuen, you would think that the hibernation would mark it in some way so that it would be know that it was being used for hibernation, though other then that, I know that it hasn't caused any issues for me, but again I don't use hibernation.
[03:49] <eracc> Problem is almost all the people that matter on USENET (the tech gurus) block posts from Google Groupd.

[03:49] <dooglus> eracc: did you see http://www.newzbot.com/ ?
[03:50] <eracc> dooglus, no, I'll go look. Thanks.
[03:50] <ERIK_LIMA> I need opinion
[03:50] <eracc> dooglus, that looks awesome. Thank you.
[03:51] <dooglus> umops: the sshd user should be created when you install the package.  try reinstalling it with "sudo apt-get --reinstall install openssh-server"
[03:51] <ERIK_LIMA> Guys, I had two Operating Systems on my Intel Pentium IV
[03:51] <ERIK_LIMA> Windows XP and Ubuntu

[03:51] <ERIK_LIMA> Ubuntu gives me a lot of problems with ATI card
[03:51] <variant> ochosi: you use nvidia card with proprietry driver?
[03:52] <ERIK_LIMA> Should I uninstall it and continue using Windows alone or...
[03:52] <ochosi> variant: no, just the standard ubuntu driver
[03:52] <variant> ERIK_LIMA: which card is it?
[03:52] <variant> ochosi: odd
[03:52] <ERIK_LIMA> I reinstall Windows XP and Ubuntu and try again to solve the problem??
[03:52] <tx> hi all, for what is used the port 5252 ( movaz-ssc ) ?
[03:52] <ochosi> variant: just installed shortly ago, so didn't mess up the system yet
[03:52] <ERIK_LIMA> it's an ATI Radeon 9250
[03:52] <variant> ERIK_LIMA: what problems specifically is it?
[03:53] <umops> dooglus, thats it! thankyou, i tried sudo apt-get remove ssh.. then reinstlaling and it didnt work, whats the difference?
[03:53] <variant> ochosi: thats strange, what hapens when it reboots? is it just a power off or what?
[03:53] <ochosi> variant: exactly
[03:53] <eracc> dooglus, thanks again. I forgot about dmoz ... I just checked and I have a bookmark for that exact URL. <blush>
[03:53] <ERIK_LIMA> One day I tried to configure the driver, i'ts doesn't work and I reinstalled Ubuntu,
[03:53] <dooglus> umops: 'ssh' is an empty package which depends on the separate client and server packages.
[03:53] <variant> ochosi: you sure you dont have a failing power supply?
[03:53] <ochosi> variant: is there a log i could have a look in for hints to the problem?
[03:53] <dooglus> umops: uninstalling 'ssh' won't uninstall 'openssh-server'
[03:53] <ochosi> variant: yes
[03:53] <ERIK_LIMA> changing the height of one or two partitions
[03:53] <variant> ERIK_LIMA: you should have the driver installed by default. you don't need to install any drivers for that card as it is suported "out of the box"
[03:53] <umops> dooglus, okay thanks again
[03:54] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, which version of ubuntu are you running?
[03:54] <webguy> i made a change to php.ini to raise the max_uploaded_file and wanted to restart apapche so it would take effect.  i ran /etc/init.d/apache2 restart but was told by the server that "httpd not running" ... when i look at running processes i see that there is a process called apache2 running.  what am i missing here?
[03:54] <variant> ochosi: yes, /var/log/messages
[03:54] <dooglus> umops: if you run "apt-cache show ssh | grep Size" you'll see that the ssh package is tiny
[03:54] <ERIK_LIMA> One day I reinstalled Ubuntu after a lot of problems with ATI card and then...
[03:54] <ochosi> variant: any idea what i could be lookin for in there?
[03:54] <ERIK_LIMA> My Windows XP don't boot!!
[03:54] <ERIK_LIMA> :(
[03:54] <variant> XiXaQ: he is like a chatbot
[03:55] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, that's ok, it's easily fixed.
[03:55] <umops> dooglus, yes i noticed that when i originally installed, i did it as the ubuntu guide this time :S
[03:55] <abuyazan_> guys can you help me
[03:55] <ERIK_LIMA> One solution is to uninstall Ubuntu and reinstall Windows XP. And then reinstall Ubuntu
[03:55] <variant> ochosi: nasty loooking messages :) warnings etc. type dmesg as well while the system is running
[03:55] <abuyazan_> what is the default root password for ubuntu
[03:55] <dooglus> !root
[03:55] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:55] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, are you listening?
[03:55] <variant> abuyazan_: there isint one, you use sudo -i to become root and if you really must you can set a root password with passwd
[03:56] <XiXaQ> variant, then perhaps he needs to be somewhere else, don't you think?
[03:56] <ERIK_LIMA> XiXaQ: I'm using version 6.10 of Ubuntu
[03:56] <variant> XiXaQ: /dev/null imo
[03:56] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, clean install or upgrade from dapper?
[03:56] <ERIK_LIMA> upgrade form Dapper
[03:56] <ERIK_LIMA> I upgrade form Dapper
[03:56] <ochosi> variant: never used dmesg before, shows my interfaces, but what for?
[03:56] <abuyazan_> variant: but i cannot change to root level su - ask about password
[03:56] <ERIK_LIMA> from Dapper...
[03:56] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, there are some problems assosiated with that. Do you get weird looking buttons and such?
[03:57] <kuja> abuyazan_: sudo -s
[03:57] <kuja> Type your user's password.
[03:57] <variant> abuyazan_: when you do sudo -i it asks for your own password then gives you a root prompt
[03:57] <kuja> You can authenticate yourself as root using the first user's password.
[03:57] <ERIK_LIMA> If anyone can help me how to solve the Windows XP boot problem, I'm grate
[03:57] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, that's not a problem. However, let's fix ubuntu first, ok?
[03:57] <kuja> ERIK_LIMA: What boot problem?
[03:57] <giupy> tell us
[03:57] <ERIK_LIMA> XiXaQ: My Windows Xp do'nt boot on GRUB.
[03:58] <ERIK_LIMA> Ubuntu loads fine
[03:58] <kuja> Any specific errors?
[03:58] <abuyazan_> i tried sudo -s and it works fine i changed the password
[03:58] <abuyazan_> thanks all
[03:58] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, I know, you said so. It should be easily fixed.
[03:58] <ERIK_LIMA> But Windows XP don't boot anymore. Even in Securty Mode
[03:58] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, you still have problems with your graphics adapter in ubuntu?
[03:58] <ERIK_LIMA> XiXaQ: But... how I do this?? :/
[03:58] <ERIK_LIMA> Yeah... :(
[03:58] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, calm down..
[03:58] <ERIK_LIMA> I still have problems with ATI Radeon 9250
[03:59] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, can you describe the problems you have with the Radeon card?
[03:59] <jshriver> What U/P do you use for Cups?
[03:59] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm planning to buy a Nvidia if I plan to continue using both Windows and Ubuntu
[03:59] <ERIK_LIMA> XixaQ: Yes... Read carefully...
[03:59] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, Radeon is fune on Ubuntu. I have Radeon 9200SE.
[03:59] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, I always do.
[04:00] <giupy> ERIK: tell us the line on /boot/grub/menu.lst regarding winxp boot
[04:00] <Oni-Dracula> k that was weird...my wifi connection simply dropped and I had to disable/enable it in the network config for it to work again
[04:00] <ERIK_LIMA> first of all, I installed Ubuntu together with Windows because my University is learning how to use Linux
[04:00] <jshriver> What U/P do you use for Cups?
[04:00] <dennister> g'morning all
[04:00] <jshriver> g'morning
[04:00] <giupy> hi denister
[04:00] <dennister> !lirc
[04:00] <ubotu> lirc: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.8.0-5ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 308 kB, installed size 1544 kB
[04:00] <ERIK_LIMA> Then.. I downloaded and installed here in my computer
[04:01] <dennister> !irkick
[04:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about irkick - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:01] <ERIK_LIMA> But, I had problems with ATI card and read a lot of guides to install it
[04:01] <giupy> erik: i mean the boot problem
[04:01] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, I've asked you to describe the "problems".
[04:01] <soundray> jshriver: what's U/P?
[04:01] <ERIK_LIMA> No guide was helpfull and one time I tried to start X and...
[04:01] <jshriver> Username/password
[04:01] <jshriver> for CUPS admin
[04:01] <ERIK_LIMA> The GUI did not start
[04:02] <XiXaQ> giupy, let's do one thing at a time, ok? First Ubuntu, then Windows.
[04:02] <ERIK_LIMA> I tried to solve problems with ATI for 5 or 6 times
[04:02] <variant> XiXaQ: wasting your time
[04:02] <JuJuBee> Does vnc only work with Gnome or does it work with KDE as well?
[04:02] <XiXaQ> variant, it's mine to waste.
[04:02] <soundray> jshriver: the first user you created during installation can maintain CUPS through System-Administration-Printing without a password.
[04:02] <variant> XiXaQ: indeed
[04:02] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, you installed Dapper both times?
[04:02] <jshriver> ? I just did apt-get install cupsys
[04:02] <ERIK_LIMA> I reinstalled Ubuntu for 5 or 6 times and on last installation...
[04:02] <webguy> i made a change to php.ini to raise the max_uploaded_file and wanted to restart apapche so it would take effect.  i ran /etc/init.d/apache2 restart but was told by the server that "httpd not running" ... when i look at running processes i see that there is a process called apache2 running.  what am i missing here?
[04:03] <jshriver> one sec
[04:03] <ERIK_LIMA> My problem was too serious that afected Windows XP boot :(
[04:03] <variant> webguy: /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
[04:03] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, it's quite normal for a clean install of Ubuntu to remove your option to boot Windows, but as I said, it's easily fixed. Let's focus on Ubuntu for now, ok?
[04:03] <ERIK_LIMA> Oh, my God... because of ATI Radeon, I made a lot of mistakes!
[04:04] <webguy> vairant "httpd not running"
[04:04] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, I've also asked you to calm down. It's very difficult to help you if you don't pay attention.
[04:04] <variant> webguy: force-reload
[04:04] <ERIK_LIMA> XiXaQ: But... I need the Internet Explorer to view a content of my "Distance Learning" of my University
[04:04] <jshriver> thanks that worked..
[04:05] <giupy> ERIK: install vmplayer
[04:05] <ERIK_LIMA> Firefox could not open the content my University has
[04:05] <jshriver> trying to setup a network printer
[04:05] <giupy> and try a fresh installation of XP under a visrtual machine
[04:05] <yemu> anyone knows how to make firefox open mms: streams?
[04:05] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, well, first of all, you can run Internet Explorer in Ubuntu :). But ok, let's fix your grub menu. sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[04:05] <giupy> could be a fix for the moment
[04:05] <variant> webguy: stop it first though
[04:05] <yemu> http streams work great
[04:05] <ERIK_LIMA> So... I need to solve the boot problem to open Internet Explorer and view the University content
[04:05] <webguy> variant  httpd (pid 19678?) not running
[04:05] <webguy> variant: how should i stop it
[04:06] <yemu> but, when theres mms stream nothing shows up
[04:06] <variant> webguy: /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
[04:06] <variant> webguy: or killall apache2 -9
[04:06] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, paste your boot menu to http://rafb.net/paste and give me the url for it.
[04:06] <JuJuBee> I got vnc running and am able to login and control a student workstation.  How do I share my screen with the students?
[04:07] <webguy> variant will try thax
[04:07] <soundray> JuJuBee: Preferences-Remote Desktop
[04:07] <davidw> it wasn't just me.  Ldap on Ubuntu is screwed up: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/libnss-ldap/+bug/51315

[04:07] <Qwerty> my apt-get keeps telling me that the package am gonna install isnt verified or something and asks Y/N but the site it d/ls from is archive.ubuntu.com and from universe :s
[04:07] <JuJuBee> On my machine or theirs?
[04:07] <ERIK_LIMA> Can anyone have the menu.list with Windows XP option??
[04:07] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, I didn't say menu.list, did I?
[04:07] <ERIK_LIMA> you said

[04:09] <fryfrog> When I installed Ubuntu, I told it my clock was set to UTC and my time zone was EST... well, for some reason even though the time zone is accurate (says est) the *time* is actually UTC :/
[04:09] <Iulian> Qwerty: I think that we have pastebin.
[04:09] <Esmo2000> hello everyone
[04:09] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, just copy and paste this: sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[04:09] <baastrup> Hi, my usb mouse ownt work on my laptop, can anyone help
[04:09] <fryfrog> So I *think* I need to tell it that my system clock *isn't* UTC... or I need to do something else :)
[04:09] <Qwerty> erm,... sorry :s
[04:09] <Esmo2000> baastrup, what kind of mouse is it ?
[04:09] <Esmo2000> is it special?
[04:09] <dooglus> fryfrog: look for 'UTC' in /etc/default/rcS
[04:09] <baastrup> Esmo2000: its a logitech G5 usb laser mouse
[04:10] <fryfrog> thanks
[04:10] <Williamts99> JuJuBee, it would be on yours
[04:10] <JuJuBee> soundray : are you suggesting that I have the students view my desktop using vncviewer?
[04:10] <Qwerty> fryfrog, right click clock > prefrences > close UTC ?
[04:10] <Esmo2000> baastrup, so a newish mouse...  did you check out the website for drivers?
[04:10] <JuJuBee> Ah ok.  There is no way to lock a student workstation remotely with vnc?
[04:10] <depi> how can I access the mounted ftp as a normal user? (mounted with curlftps)
[04:10] <soundray> JuJuBee: isn't that what you meant by "how do I share my screen..."?
[04:10] <baastrup> Esmo2000: what website?, its found in demsg
[04:11] <variant> !ltsp
[04:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ltsp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:11] <variant> ffs
=== borg is now known as botxj
[04:11] <JuJuBee> soundray : years ago I used a program that let me "push" my screen onto theirs (in a MAC environment).
[04:11] <Esmo2000> I have a question for peeps, I have a qosmio g30 and i can't get the refresh rate at 75hz, even though i enabled it in that xserver-xorg reconfigure
[04:11] <fryfrog> JuJuBee: you can also use "screen" if you are just tryign to show a cmd line session
[04:11] <ERIK_LIMA> Ok, XiXaQ. Now I'm seeing the content of menu.lst
[04:11] <dooglus> JuJuBee: if you are viewing a student's screen, they can't view yours at the same time, or you will create a loop in the space time continuum and end up marrying your own grandmother.
[04:11] <ERIK_LIMA> What to do next??
[04:11] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, paste it to http://rafb.net/paste
[04:12] <Qwerty> http://adterrasperaspera.com/blog/2006/06/20/logitech-g5-review-under-linux/
[04:12] <JuJuBee> I do not wish to view theirs while they are viewing mine.
[04:12] <ERIK_LIMA> what?? Paste the file on a Web Stie?? But for what?? :/
[04:12] <folder> I've just installed slab with automatix2, and it's not done anything. What am I doing wrong?
[04:12] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, so that I can see what the file looks like.
[04:13] <JuJuBee> Does vnc only work with GNOME?
[04:13] <soundray> JuJuBee: if you could "push" your screen, that would be a major security hole, wouldn't it?
[04:13] <dooglus> JuJuBee: no, it works almost anywhere - windows, linux, mac, etc.
[04:13] <variant> JuJuBee: you can use vnc on any graphical environment
[04:13] <JuJuBee> Ok
[04:13] <JuJuBee> I cant see where to configure it under KDE.
[04:13] <variant> JuJuBee: you can use vnc to open a display of your desktop on  a users computer
[04:13] <LGKeiz> variant - vnc is exploitable
[04:14] <LGKeiz> use remote desktop
[04:14] <dooglus> soundray: you can 'push' your screen, using vncconnect - tell a VNC server to connect to a viewer
[04:14] <LGKeiz> vnc hasn't fixed the exploit neither
[04:14] <dooglus> LGKeiz: do you have a reference for that?
[04:14] <variant> LGKeiz: what you talking about? you mean the fact that passwords are sent as clear text and the protocall is not encrypted?
[04:14] <i0null_> Edgy won't configure any of my usbports
[04:14] <soundray> dooglus: you'd still have to set the client up specifically, wouldn't you?
[04:14] <variant> LGKeiz: easy to fix with ssh
[04:15] <LGKeiz> variant: correct
[04:15] <ERIK_LIMA> OK... it's pasted...
[04:15] <dooglus> soundray: yes, you need to run the client with the --listen flag to tell it to listen for people pushing their screens to you
[04:15] <raghu206> what is keyboard short-cut key for gnome-main-menu ?
[04:15] <variant> soundray: yes you do, but its a once off configuration
[04:15] <LGKeiz> variant: but.. It's still exploitable, I've been cracked into with it atleast 3 times
[04:15] <ERIK_LIMA> And what to do now, XiXaQ?
[04:15] <jrib> raghu206: alt-f1 is default but change it in your keyboard shortcuts
[04:15] <LGKeiz> Heh, It's just a warning believe me or not.
[04:15] <i0null_> GRR
[04:15] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, I'm sorry, I have to go. You'll need to create an entry in the boot.lst file.
[04:15] <variant> LGKeiz: vnc is not designed to be used on an untrusted network. thats your fault for using it on the internet
[04:16] <Jimb1> trying to learn the shell and im already stuck
[04:16] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: give me the URL of the pasted page please.
[04:16] <variant> Jimb1: what with?
[04:16] <raghu206> jrib, alt-f1 for launching application menu ?
[04:16] <ERIK_LIMA> http://rafb.net/paste/results/uKqoh179.html
[04:16] <XiXaQ> ERIK_LIMA, It's easily fixed. :) Good luck exploring Ubuntu :)
[04:16] <dooglus> variant: JuJuBee is talking about using it in a class full of students - that's an untrusted network - one of those students will probably be running a password sniff to get the teacher's login details :)
[04:16] <ERIK_LIMA> thanks... lead the way
[04:16] <jrib> raghu206: try it
[04:16] <Williamts99> LGKeiz, Might want to use a firewall in that case
[04:16] <Jimb1> variant: im trying to cd into home/jgh and it wont let me
[04:17] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: when you boot, do you get to see a grub menu?
[04:17] <ERIK_LIMA> Yes
[04:17] <variant> Jimb1: what error?
[04:17] <Jimb1> variant: it will let me into other folders but not in the home folder
[04:17] <dooglus> Jimb1: because it's owned by someone other than you.
[04:17] <Jimb1> one sec ill do it again and get error
[04:17] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: when you choose the last entry on that menu, the one called "Microsoft Windows XP Professional", and hit return, what happens?
[04:18] <raghu206> jrib, i dint get u ?
[04:18] <dooglus> Jimb1: "sudo chown o+rx /home/jgh" will fix it to let anyone cd into /home/jgh
[04:18] <gahan> how do i send a file over bluetooth fro mmy computer to phone ?
[04:18] <jrib> raghu206: press alt-f1 and see if it does what you want it to
[04:18] <variant> dooglus: you might want to let him finnish before presuming you know what his problem is
[04:18] <ERIK_LIMA> This is what happens when I try to load Windows XP:
[04:18] <mangojambo> hello people ...
[04:18] <raghu206> jrib, no it doesnt do what i need
[04:18] <ERIK_LIMA> The XP try to load and gives me an error message and ask for choose
[04:18] <dooglus> variant: if you think that will help, sure
[04:19] <ERIK_LIMA> "Starting normally" "Line Prompt" "Line Prompt with NET" "Last Valid Configuration"
=== ayaa is now known as fourat
[04:19] <JuJuBee> Thanks for the assistance with vnc.
[04:19] <Jimb1> doodglus...its my machine and i installed the os...how can it be owned by someone else?
[04:19] <Williamts99> Erik_Lima, Start Normally
[04:19] <i0null_> Is there any reason that ubuntu won't load any usb devices other then mouse's?
[04:19] <dooglus> Jimb1: what user are you logged in as?
[04:19] <mangojambo> I don't found in google so... someone knows if the xserver-xephyr package (edgy) comes with EVDEV support ?
[04:19] <variant> dooglus: considering that the default on ubuntu is not to restrict the users home directorys beond write support i would say that it not hte problem
[04:20] <JuJuBee> Is there a more secure remote control alternative?
[04:20] <ERIK_LIMA> I choose one of them and, repently, the Windows XP screen appears, don't load and the computer reboot
[04:20] <ERIK_LIMA> reboot automatically
[04:20] <variant> JuJuBee: you can encrypt vnc with ssh wich makes it just as secure as ssh
[04:20] <giupy> ERIK: i suppose it's an error of XP then
[04:20] <Jimb1> jgh
[04:20] <raghu206> jrib, i mean to say abt slab
[04:20] <Oni-Dracula> whats the name of that audio editor?
[04:20] <ERIK_LIMA> Either I chosse "Line Prompt" or "Security Mode" the problem is the same: Windows XP don't boot
[04:20] <JuJuBee> variant : how?
[04:20] <dooglus> Jimb1: oh, ok.  variant is right then.  :)
[04:20] <Williamts99> Erik_lima, that is an error with your Windows then
[04:20] <Jimb1> dooglus   im logged as jgh i thnk
[04:20] <variant> JuJuBee: or you can use other protocalls such as freenx or rdp. but those may not be as secure as an ssh'd vnc connection (you can put them over ssh too!)
[04:21] <dooglus> Jimb1: what does a "ls -ld /home/jgh" show?
[04:21] <mangojambo> I'm trying to make a multiseat in one of mine PCs ... but it's hard ... :/
[04:21] <ERIK_LIMA> I suppose it's caused by a driver
[04:21] <jrib> raghu206: I don't know what that is
[04:21] <noodles12> I just installed bazaar but i searched and i don't find the folders and "bzr" is not a recognized command. did bazaar not realy install when apt-get said it did?
[04:21] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: your grub setup is fine. Would it be terrible if you had to reinstall Windows XP?
[04:21] <giupy> ERIK: sometimes XP does sometimes like file corruption, maybe it's your prob
[04:21] <variant> Jimb1: what was the error message? was it permission denied?
[04:21] <Jimb1> one sec
[04:21] <ERIK_LIMA> I think that's because of the ATI driver installation, that I had problems and installed Ubuntu several times to try to fix it
[04:22] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: no, definitely not.
=== fourat is now known as loca|host
[04:22] <ERIK_LIMA> My GRUB setup is fine?? But how I boot Windows XP? :/
[04:22] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: anything you do with Ubuntu and its drivers won't affect Windows in the least.
[04:22] <raghu206> jrib, http://reverendted.wordpress.com/2006/06/17/show-me-that-new-gnome-main-menu/
[04:22] <jrib> noodles12: you probably want to install bzr instead.  Read the description for the bazaar package
[04:22] <Jimb1> varient   said no such file or directory
[04:22] <variant> Jimb1: lol
[04:22] <variant> Jimb1: type ls /home
[04:22] <ERIK_LIMA> I can't, since I made a lot of mistakes with ATI driver installation.
[04:23] <Jimb1> ok
[04:23] <giupy> ERIK: mabe this link could be helpful http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/
[04:23] <NineTeen67Comet> Two things are kicking my butt .. First I let kdm be default for login but I want gdm back, and although nvidia is installed it isn't running the show (xorg.conf is nvidia not nv, and there is no rendering going on, and a long black screen at the login screen before you can enter your name)... help?
[04:23] <Shadow_mil> Hey!  I got a idea... this weekend when happy feet comes out, why don't we go out to the movie places, and give away Linux CDs/Infomational sheet
[04:23] <jrib> raghu206: oh I see what you mean now, I don't know the answer to your question though
[04:23] <ERIK_LIMA> Instead to run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I reinstalled Ubuntu
[04:23] <ERIK_LIMA> and change the partition height to include /swap
[04:23] <giupy> ERIK: it's about a live XP cd
[04:23] <squeaks> i'm on a laptop and am experiencing cpu usage by Xorg spiking to near 90% when scrolling in firefox or moving a window around, does anyone have a forum post handy that solves this? I can't find one.
[04:23] <variant> NineTeen67Comet: dpkg-reconfigure gdm to fix the first problem
[04:23] <variant> NineTeen67Comet: and nv is the non 3d accelerated driver nvidia is the 3d one
[04:23] <ERIK_LIMA> because I thinked I needed swap to install ATI correctly.
[04:24] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: You need to decide now whether you want to fix Windows first, or Ubuntu first.
[04:24] <ERIK_LIMA> But I was toooo wrong :(
[04:24] <Jimb1> varient it says   jgh@Jgh-linux:~$ /home
[04:24] <Jimb1> bash: /home: is a directory
[04:24] <giupy> ERIK: 'dyou read my posts
[04:24] <giupy> ?
[04:24] <Jimb1> so?
[04:24] <ERIK_LIMA> first... let's fix Windows
[04:24] <NineTeen67Comet> variant: yes I know that's what's got my brain in a mush .. xorg.conf has nvidia not nv (I let the pkg write it ) ..
[04:24] <i0null_> Can anyone help?
[04:24] <dooglus> Jimb1: "ls /home" not just "/home"
[04:24] <variant> NineTeen67Comet: i don't know if the proprietry drivers support tnt cards.. i think utahglx might though
[04:24] <noodles12> jrib: thanks. I just assumed they wre teh same
[04:24] <NineTeen67Comet> variant: I'll go google it .. (I'm from utah .. too cool) ..
[04:25] <ERIK_LIMA> Windows First, because it's my main operating system. Because other people in my home use my PC
[04:25] <variant> NineTeen67Comet: lol
[04:25] <Jimb1> doogle  jgh@Jgh-linux:~$  ls -ld /home/jgh
[04:25] <Jimb1> drwxr-xr-x 29 jgh jgh 4096 2006-11-15 09:20 /home/jgh
[04:25] <ERIK_LIMA> and they have more familiar knowledge with Windows
[04:25] <NineTeen67Comet> ERIK_LIMA: do as I did .. "Whoops, I'm sorry windows broke, and only Linux will work on this computer now" .. lol
[04:25] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: okay, to fix Windows, this isn't the best place. You need to get advice from somewhere else. Take giupy's pointer as a starter.
[04:25] <ERIK_LIMA> And I use Windows to play Half-Life and Counter-Strike
[04:26] <variant> NineTeen67Comet: http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net/
[04:26] <dooglus> Jimb1: your original question stated that you were trying to cd into "home/jgh".  did you mean "/home/jgh"?  because "home/jgh" is relative to the current directory
[04:26] <HorzA-dcc> what do i type to see what ubuntuserver version i have?
[04:26] <ERIK_LIMA> what is this? ---> giupy's pointer
[04:26] <Jimb1> doogle...yes
[04:26] <giupy> have to quit,by
[04:27] <giupy> ERIK: my suggestion of the winXP livecd
[04:27] <Jimb1> cd /home/jgh/music
[04:27] <NineTeen67Comet> variant: thanks .. Just found it as you typed it .. I know when XP was on this old box I had to use the older 6x.xx driver ..
[04:27] <variant> Jimb1: in irc type doo and press the tab key
[04:27] <soundray> ERIK_LIMA: scroll up and find the line that giupy posted.
[04:27] <giupy> by all,thnx

[04:29] <dooglus> tuskernini: you may need to forward port 80 on your router to point to your ubuntu machine
[04:29] <Jimb1> doogle and varient, i think it just started working
[04:29] <variant> tuskernini: browse to your ip address

[04:29] <Jimb1> i am able to cd /home/jgh/music
[04:29] <doogle> Jimb1: maybe you were missing the first '/' before?
[04:29] <tuskernini> variant, i tried to browse to my ip and went to the router... so i guess i have to forward port 80
[04:30] <variant> dorto: yep, i hate the menu editor. it's totaly unintuative and mostly utterly useless. i don't know how to edit it beond that, i have asked in #gnome but people ignore the question like it's a sore point or somthing
[04:30] <doogle> tuskernini: yes.  or you could forward any other port you like, and use http://ip:port/
[04:30] <dorto> variant, hehe
[04:30] <Jimb1> doogle, no the first / was there i musta tried 50 time's
[04:30] <variant> tuskernini: best if you forward port 80

[04:33] <Jimb1> how do i play a music file using he command prompt?

[04:34] <dorto> variant, I am finally able to change the text by right clicking on the menu item and selecting properties in menu layout dialog box(that you suggested). thx

[04:35] <finalbeta> doogle, Yeah, I'm starting to fear that is how it works, reported over 20 bugs in the last months, none get fixed.
[04:35] <ERIK_LIMA> It's the web site for my University
[04:35] <Jimb1> doogle do i have to cd into the music directory first?
[04:35] <doogle> finalbeta: even when I submit a patch that fixes the problem along with the bug report, it still often gets ignored.
[04:35] <baastrup> Qwerty: demsg even find it, and it works fine in windoze
[04:35] <ERIK_LIMA> But the page is not my problem...
[04:35] <Williamts99> erik_lima, Which part of the site is causing the issue?
[04:35] <Qwerty> baastrup, thats bad :s
[04:36] <finalbeta> doogle, something is fundamentally wrong then. :/
[04:36] <ERIK_LIMA> Do you see "EAD"??
[04:36] <doogle> Jimb1: you have to install mgp123 or mplayer first.  you don't have to cd - you can either: "cd music" and then "mpg123 file.mp3" or you can "mpg123 music/file.mp3" in one step
[04:36] <baastrup> Qwerty: yeah hate this
[04:36] <tuskernini> variant, ok, i forwarded the port... no luck, should i restart apache?
[04:36] <doogle> finalbeta: I think the problem is that ubuntu doesn't have enough developers involved with it

[04:36] <Qwerty> Kmob tools's for KDE :s

[04:38] <ERIK_LIMA> Then I choose one of EAD green ball, click on it and the lesson doesn't start
[04:38] <doogle> tuskernini: that's odd.  try forwarding some big port number like 55555 on the router to port 80 on your ubuntu machine, then visit http://ip.address:55555/

[04:42] <sidewalk`> when i run a iwlist eth1 scan, i get info
[04:42] <sidewalk`> but i cant dhclient eth1
[04:42] <finalbeta> doogle, what package should I report firewire issues against?
[04:42] <sidewalk`> anyone have any tips?
[04:42] <Williamts99> Erik_Lima, that's it, just have to follow the instructions in the downloaded file, it is pretty much extract and replace
[04:42] <doogle> finalbeta: the kernel, I guess
[04:43] <doogle> finalbeta: linux-image
[04:43] <tuskernini> doogle, ok i get that when going to 84.75.88.3:55555 too after forwarding 55555 to port 80
[04:43] <ERIK_LIMA> Downloading the beta version... :)

[04:44] <doogle> tuskernini: I tried going to http://84.75.88.3:55555/ a couple of minutes ago, before you forwarded it, and it just sat there, trying to connect
[04:44] <probose> Qwerty what i must put in "ACM Device"?
[04:44] <tuskernini> doogle, and now?
[04:44] <doogle> tuskernini: but if I try it now, it fails instantly with "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 84.75.88.3:55555".  so I guess the forwarding is working, and the apache isn't...
[04:44] <botxj> a file manager for a phone.... what the heck?
[04:44] <tuskernini> :-)
[04:44] <doogle> tuskernini: have you set the firewall up on the ubuntu box?
[04:44] <tuskernini> doogle, no firewall
[04:45] <tuskernini> afaik
[04:45] <neenaoffline> can anyone help me with apt/dpkg ?
[04:45] <doogle> tuskernini: "sudo iptables -L" will show you the firewall rules.  you should see 3 "policy ACCEPT" lines by default
[04:46] <Qwerty> probose, dunno but to find acm you could use this 'dmesg | grep ACM'
[04:46] <Qwerty> I dont have a moto btw :s
[04:46] <probose> Qwerty what is 'dmesg | grep ACM'?
[04:46] <Williamts99> doogle, is the server on the same computer and or network?
[04:46] <tuskernini> doogle, i see 3x ACCEPT
[04:47] <doogle> tuskernini: right.  that's an open firewall - no restrictions
[04:47] <Qwerty> a command for the terminal probose
[04:47] <tuskernini> doogle, does it mean anything if my localhost works?
[04:47] <doogle> Williamts99: tuskernini is running the server on his LAN with the router forwarding traffic to it, and I'm trying to connect.
[04:47] <doogle> tuskernini: yes, I guess that means the web server is working...
[04:48] <Qwerty> probose, which moto ?
[04:48] <doogle> tuskernini: is there something else in the way perhaps?  like a modem or something?
[04:48] <probose> Qwerty is a c357
[04:48] <tuskernini> doogle, i have a cable modem and a wireless router... thats it

[04:53] <Galfrid> lol, ok thanks
[04:53] <bobslaede> np
[04:54] <ERIK_LIMA> I tried... but the page I need to view don't open. If I use Internet Explorer, the page open

[04:54] <ERIK_LIMA> To go there, each student of the university need to enter an username and password
[04:54] <richee> sorry wrong channel
[04:54] <doogle> jshriver: so  grep -F .log   or   grep -F "\.log"   or   grep -F "[.] log"
[04:55] <ERIK_LIMA> after that, the main page of EAD loads and the studente chosse one of "green balls"

[04:55] <ERIK_LIMA> Maybe it's a site protection against Firefox users
[04:56] <Williamts99> Erik_Lima, I am guessing that it must really be a website that doesn't conform to web standards
[04:56] <ERIK_LIMA> Beacause the site was developed for Windows users... I think
[04:56] <ERIK_LIMA> Williamst99: I agree with you
[04:56] <Williamts99> Erik_lima, It is pretty sad actually, but I guess you are going to have to install IE on Linux
[04:57] <Williamts99> Erik_Lima, did you copy that site that I sent you
[04:57] <Limulf>  I want Ubuntu (6.10) to start without opening any windows from its previous use, so I have changed my session configuration, unchecking the save session changes automatically option. My problem is that i don't know how to prevent from appearing two windows: the session manager and a Nautilus window showing my home directory. I have tried to remove the gnome-session-properties from the current session tab in the session manager
[04:57] <Limulf>  window,  but after closing and opening again the session manager, the gnome-session-properties program is again there. This is barely an annoyance, but I would like to know the solution anyway. Thanks for your time and work.
[04:57] <tuskernini> doogle, the first address is my actual router address
[04:57] <doogle> tuskernini: I see this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31938/  - line 2 begins with my real IP address, meaning there's only one network between me any my ISP (ie. my router)
[04:57] <MeisterZopf> can any body tell my which IDE is shown here? http://www.rubyonrails.org/images/screencasts/15minutes.gif
[04:58] <doogle> tuskernini: nothing that your external IP address doesn't appear until line 3 (probably), meaning that there are 2 networks between you and your ISP - that'll be your router and your modem.
[04:58] <doogle> tuskernini: they'll both need forwarding.
[04:58] <Williamts99> Erik_Lima, I would complain to the site admins also, but that is just me, though it is really rare these days that a site doesn't work with Firefox
[04:58] <tuskernini> doogle, i had a server once but dont recall forwarding modem aswell... dont even know how!
[04:59] <doogle> tuskernini: point your browser at 10.174.64.1 and you'll see your modem settings I think
[04:59] <sidewalk`> does anyone know if WEP2/TKIP works with wireless in Linux?

[04:59] <tuskernini> doogle, Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 10.174.64.1.
[04:59] <Williamts99> Tuskernini, usually it is the DSL modems that tend to block ports, not usually the cable modems
[05:00] <ERIK_LIMA> Williamst99: By the way... do you what's wrong with my boot on Windows XP??
[05:00] <ERIK_LIMA> :/
[05:00] <doogle> tuskernini: I'm probably talking nonsense.  the modem doesn't need forwarding set up does it...
[05:00] <bettola> hi
[05:00] <doogle> tuskernini: because my connection attempt is getting paste your modem to your router already, so that part is fine.
[05:01] <bettola> i have a problem with nvidia driver
[05:01] <bettola> no direct rendering!!!
[05:01] <tuskernini> doogle, ok i understand that much...
[05:01] <Williamts99> Erik_lima, Yes, it is windowsXP :-)
[05:01] <bettola> with the latest nvidia driver
[05:01] <ERIK_LIMA> Maybe I need to get the CD to reinstall it
[05:01] <Williamts99> Erik_lima, you could try and use the system repair part of the CD
[05:01] <tuskernini> doogle, must be something with apache then? but i see it fine from localhost... aaah!!!
[05:02] <ERIK_LIMA> Ok... I have to go now. Bye!!
[05:02] <doogle> tuskernini: can you set up a new port forward on the router?  forward 44444 on the router to 44444 on your ubuntu box
[05:02] <Williamts99> Erik_lima, but yea, once you install IE on Linux, send me a message and let me know if it works
[05:02] <tuskernini> ok will do
[05:02] <doogle> tuskernini: then run a "nc -l -p 44444" on the ubuntu box.  that's a very basic 'server' to test the connection
[05:03] <kuun> hello
[05:04] <Rob125> howdy hi
[05:04] <doogle> tuskernini: did that work?
[05:04] <tuskernini> doogle, yes!
[05:04] <tuskernini> doogle, youre the man!
[05:04] <doogle> ok, so we know port forwarding is ok.  try replying to me
[05:04] <doogle> in that 'nc' window
[05:05] <bettola> any hints for the nvidia direct rendering?
[05:05] <keithhhhh> anyone using GAIM 2.0  ??  1.5 seems to have problems with MSN  :(
[05:05] <KenSentMe> keithhhhh: i use it
[05:05] <bettola> me , i use it
[05:05] <Williamts99> keithhhhh, Yep, I use it too
[05:05] <keithhhhh> hmmmm
[05:05] <docmur> I need some help, I want to put windows back on my drive so I've resized my /home to allow for the extra space and it all work and I can run windows setup and format the space and it copys the files but when it restarts to run the actual setup all I ever get is an NTLDR loader missing ?????
[05:05] <hoelk> anyone knows if kdevelop is on the dvd version of kubuntu?
[05:05] <Isyth> ah yes, good afternoon.
[05:05] <keithhhhh> maybe its my friend then
[05:05] <docmur> any one know how to fix it
[05:06] <keithhhhh> oh
[05:06] <doogle> tuskernini: you'll need to "sudo nc -l -p 80" because only root can listen on port 80
[05:06] <keithhhhh> you guys use 2.0?
[05:06] <Williamts99> yes
[05:06] <kuun> exit
[05:06] <Williamts99> well a beta of 2.0
[05:06] <keithhhhh> Williamts99: how did you install it?
[05:06] <Isyth> I'm looking for a way to write .pdf's with my openoffice.org-- any idea?
[05:06] <BlackHawk> docmur: you have to setup your mbr correctly
[05:06] <tuskernini> doogle, ok, where is my apache again /?
[05:06] <Williamts99> It is included in Edgy
[05:06] <Rob125> isyth - try 'export to pdf'
[05:06] <tuskernini> usr app?
[05:06] <Rob125> it's right above save
[05:06] <docmur> okay but why doesn't windows just do what it always does and over right it
[05:06] <doogle> tuskernini: "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop" I guess
[05:06] <keithhhhh> Williamts99: oh
[05:06] <keithhhhh> :(
[05:06] <docmur> ???? how can I write it with out effecting ubuntu
[05:06] <BlackHawk> good question :)
[05:07] <BlackHawk> with grub
[05:07] <Almindor> is it me or is scorched earth 3d broken in the repos?
[05:07] <Isyth> rob125: I will crouch in a corner in shame now.
[05:07] <Isyth> thank you.
[05:07] <Rob125> no worries :)
[05:07] <Almindor> I get a coredump on run
[05:07] <docmur> I'm lost wont that just right a grub loader file
[05:07] <BlackHawk> you can install grub on the mbr and setup all operating systems with it
[05:07] <KenSentMe> keithhhhh: there is some repo for installing gaim2 on dapper
[05:07] <docmur> really
[05:07] <docmur> okay
[05:07] <docmur> is it in the grub doc
[05:08] <BlackHawk> i got the problem some weeks ago, i started with live-cd and reinstalled grub
[05:08] <keithhhhh> KenSentMe: ok Ill keep looking
[05:08] <docmur> I know how to reinstall gfrub
[05:08] <docmur> *grub
[05:08] <BlackHawk> it's important to start with live-cd, without you can't write the mbr, because the disk is active
[05:08] <tuskernini> doogle, ok do me
[05:09] <docmur> okay and that will fix windows tell me that NTLDR is missing
[05:09] <Almindor> BlackHawk, ??/
[05:09] <doogle> tuskernini: which port did you forward?
[05:09] <Almindor> BlackHawk, you can write to mbr anytime with rooty
[05:09] <keithhhhh> KenSentMe: I think I found it thanks  ;)
[05:09] <tuskernini> doogle, cant-grab 0.0.0.0:80 with bind
[05:09] <BlackHawk> even with active diskdrive ?
[05:09] <doogle> tuskernini: you need to use sudo
[05:09] <tuskernini> did
[05:09] <BlackHawk> it didn't work when i tried
[05:09] <tuskernini> wil do again
[05:09] <Williamts99> You can use easyubuntu to upgrade to gaim 2.0 beta3 I believe
[05:09] <doogle> tuskernini: so apache is still running?
[05:09] <tuskernini> yes
[05:10] <someperson> hi. i can't seem to open pretty much any app in dapper, it starts loading, then closes it. I had to use the vista part of my hard drive to go on here
[05:10] <Almindor> yes
[05:10] <doogle> tuskernini: only one program can be listening on any port at a time
[05:10] <tuskernini> doogle, wil restart again
[05:10] <KenSentMe> keithhhhh: no problem
[05:10] <BlackHawk> ok i had changed the partition table as well :P
[05:10] <lstarr> This installation is friggin so simple!!!  I'm on the third macine in the house, and I started less than 3 hours ago.
[05:10] <Almindor> BlackHawk, you can even now for example you can 0 your mbr with dd
[05:10] <tuskernini> doogle, so should i stop apache?
[05:10] <doogle> tuskernini: yes
[05:10] <Williamts99> keithhhhh, the easiest way is to use easyubuntu
[05:10] <Discerer> what's the difference between ubuntu and ubuntu-server?
[05:10] <BlackHawk> ah k, then it was the parttable i think *confused* :P
[05:11] <Williamts99> http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/
[05:11] <tuskernini> doogle,  ok
[05:11] <doogle> Discerer: nothing much, other than the list of packages installed by default
[05:11] <Isyth> well, my problems are solved, I will go now! Bye!
[05:11] <CharminTheMoose> may I ask a stupid n00b question regarding my wlan?
[05:11] <Isyth> and thanks!
[05:12] <KenSentMe> Williamts99: easyubuntu isn't supported here
[05:12] <Rob125> discerer: ubuntu-server comes as a LAMP server, without a desktop gui, while ubuntu itself comes as a gui with no server
[05:12] <docmur> okay and that will fix windows tell me that NTLDR is missing ????
[05:12] <runpain> hey im back but im using windoz desktop
[05:12] <docmur> which was my question
[05:13] <MeisterZopf> does easyubuntu run with edgy?
[05:13] <docmur> no
[05:13] <Discerer> ok thanks Rob125
[05:13] <docmur> MeisterZpf
[05:13] <MeisterZopf> thanks docmur
[05:13] <docmur> they don't have the right code
[05:14] <Discerer> the LAMP server, is it configured in any way?
[05:14] <KenSentMe> !easyubuntu | MeisterZopf
[05:14] <ubotu> MeisterZopf: easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[05:14] <Discerer> or just ready to config?
[05:14] <runpain> how do i do the 2wire wirless card setup step by step please
[05:14] <docmur> what I last read is they didn't have the promission
[05:14] <CharminTheMoose> I have a dell wireless 1450 usb adapter and i've set it up with ndiwrapper.And it's detected and there's no errors etc etc,but I can't seem to connect to my wlan downstairs.Am I missing something?I've entered my wep key and I changed the encryption from wpa to wep and despite that it still refuses to work

[05:16] <Williamts99> kensentme, is gaim 2.0 on anything before edgy?
[05:16] <wishlog> How can I check whether my Java Virtual Envirnoment installed well in ubuntu?
[05:16] <KenSentMe> Williamts99: there are packages for dapper
[05:16] <someperson> hi. i can't seem to open pretty much any app in dapper, it starts loading, then closes it. I had to use the vista part of my hard drive to go on here (GAIM, lol)
[05:16] <Rob125> wishlog: use it. if it breaks, it didn't :P
[05:16] <KenSentMe> Williamts99: search ubuntuforums.org on gaim and dapper, first hit
[05:17] <someperson> should i re-install?
[05:17] <KenSentMe> someperson: check for errors by running the crashing apps from the command line
[05:17] <Williamts99> kensentme, didn't know that it was offically backported
[05:18] <KenSentMe> Williamts99: not officially, but some people made debs themselves
[05:18] <someperson> oh. good idea. *Exiting teh pr3tty Vista UI for shtty 1024x768 'buntu*
[05:20] <keithhhhh> a
[05:20] <keithhhhh> Thanks everyone I found gaim 2.0  ;)
[05:20] <probose> hey... when i mess in moto4lin options, i put "ok" but when i go to the options again, my changes were not made!
[05:20] <sidewalk`> anyone know if WPA2/TKIP works with ubuntu?
[05:20] <sidewalk`> using wireless
[05:20] <Rob125> probose: is there an apply button?
[05:21] <we2by> sidewalk`: it works
[05:21] <probose> Rob125 no =/
[05:21] <we2by> it really depends on your driver though
[05:21] <runpain> how do i install driver for wireless card
[05:21] <Rob125> dunno, then, sorry - never heard of the program.
[05:21] <Williamts99> runpain, depends on your wireless card
[05:21] <docmur> I just had an Idea could I not use VM ware to set windows up on a partition, the freespace I created then config grub
[05:21] <docmur> ????
[05:21] <we2by> runpain: does wireless work (with wep) work out of the box?
[05:21] <runpain> 2wire
[05:22] <runpain> how do i get computer to reconize it
[05:22] <keithhhhh> anyone have this same problem...I hear sound in flash but not anywhere else  OR  I can hear sound everywhere except flash.  I cant hear sound thru both at the same time.
[05:22] <bunnythebunny> Hey guys, i've just installed ubuntu and it seems to be a bit slow, when for example changing between conversation tabs. Is it supossed to be like this? Do i need to install something else?
[05:22] <Williamts99> what model of 2wire?
[05:22] <we2by> sidewalk`:  does wireless work (with wep) work out of the box?
[05:23] <runpain> wait ill see
[05:23] <keithhhhh> bunnythebunny: do you mean Ubuntu is slow or just chatting?
[05:23] <doogle> bunnythebunny: ubuntu indexes the whole hard disk once a day.  it might be doing that now if you've just installed it
[05:24] <Williamts99> I am guessing the card is USB?
[05:24] <runpain> agere wifi
[05:24] <runpain> pcmcia
[05:25] <sidewalk`> we2by: i have no idea
[05:25] <bunnythebunny> Well its slow in overall. It feels slow. Not just when chatting. Changing a tab between firefox, and i dont know the terminal. Or when im trying to run somthing while there are a few other things already oppened...
[05:25] <sidewalk`> we2by: i cant get an IP-address of my router
[05:25] <we2by> sidewalk`: is it using wpa or wep?
[05:25] <sidewalk`> if i do an iwlist eth1 scan, i get the interface
[05:25] <sidewalk`> we2by: whatever i want?
[05:25] <doogle> tuskernini: that's working now.
[05:25] <tuskernini> doogle, when i start apache i get apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
[05:26] <we2by> sidewalk`: most wireless cards work oout of the box with wep
[05:26] <Lathiat> 
[05:26] <bunnythebunny> doogle: I installed it yesterday though. Its lsow like hell right now and i have no idea why.
[05:26] <we2by> for wpa you seed some settings
[05:26] <we2by> !wpa
[05:26] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:26] <tuskernini> doogle,  how is it working?
[05:26] <we2by> there is a howto for wpa
[05:26] <doogle> bunnythebunny: run a terminal and run "top" in the terminal.  it should show what's making it slow
[05:26] <tuskernini> doogle, my ip is still showing to my router
[05:26] <doogle> tuskernini: I see your "how to get lamp running" page at http://84.75.88.3/
[05:26] <runpain> william its a 2wire agere wifi pcmcia card
[05:26] <news> hello
[05:27] <tuskernini> doogle, :-)
[05:27] <tuskernini> weird that i cant see it...
[05:27] <Rob125> doogle: weird, that's a nifty command
[05:27] <doogle> tuskernini: I see it at http://84.75.88.3:55555/ too, of course.
[05:27] <Williamts99> what do you get by entering lspci into the terminal?
[05:27] <tuskernini> doogle, you are the BEST.. thank you so much!
[05:27] <dylan_> I have an IBM ThinkPad T22 laptop that will not use the Live CD because of some graphics issues.  The CD loads to the point where it says "Starting GNOME Display Manager", then the screen blanks and the computer freezes.
[05:27] <doogle> tuskernini: no problem.  don't forget to un-forward 44444 and 55555 :)
[05:28] <tuskernini> doogle, wierd i cant see :55555 ?
[05:28] <news> anyone has an idea about a very small distro only for webbrowsing purpose ?
[05:28] <runpain> will try that william
[05:28] <tuskernini> doogle, cant establish connection
[05:28] <tuskernini> whatever
[05:28] <doogle> tuskernini: that is strange.
[05:28] <runpain> can we talk in a differant window please
[05:28] <tuskernini> yep
[05:28] <runpain> william
[05:28] <doogle> tuskernini: you can't expect localhost:55555 to work
[05:28] <bunnythebunny> doogle: what should ib el ooking at as a indicator for memory usage ?
[05:28] <rellis> When I do 'ethtool eth0' it reports 'Speed: Unknown! (65535)' 'Duplex: Unknown! (255)'... I have verified the drop I'm using into is good. The NIC I'm using is on-board and I've tried three different system boards.
[05:29] <doogle> tuskernini: because that won't go via the router, and the router is the only thing that knows about 55555
[05:29] <dylan_> news, Damn Small Linux
[05:29] <tuskernini> doogle, no, with the ip
[05:29] <tuskernini> ok
[05:29] <Rob125> time to go to work.
[05:29] <tuskernini> doogle, ok..
[05:29] <doogle> bunnythebunny: in 'top', press '<' and '>' to change which column it's sorting by.
[05:29] <bunnythebunny> doogle:  what i can tell from "top" its that my whole memory is being chewed up and i've got almost nothing running
[05:29] <bunnythebunny> oh ill do that
[05:29] <rellis> This only happens on eth0. eth0 and eth1 are identical on-board nics.
[05:29] <news> dylan_: thanks
[05:29] <Jimb1> so is ext3 readable by windows?
[05:29] <Jimb1> I didnt think it was
[05:29] <LjL> !ext3 > jimb1
[05:30] <doogle> bunnythebunny: if you press '<' 4 times from the start, it'll sort by 'VIRT' (ie. virtual memory size)
[05:30] <Jimb1> LjL..??
[05:30] <LjL> jimb1, you got a message from the bot with a link to the ext3 driver for windows
[05:30] <doogle> bunnythebunny: Linux will generally use all available memory for disk cache and such like - what's the point of having memory if you're not going to use it?
[05:30] <AsheD> anybody experienced with mencoder?
[05:31] <LjL> !anyone
[05:31] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:31] <doogle> AsheD: a little...
[05:31] <Jimb1> My xp machine is able to see the files on the ext3 partion on the linux machine already
[05:31] <truk77> anybody know of any resources for installing ubuntu on a Dell Inspiron 1501?
[05:31] <Jimb1> i guess i should have made hdb1 ext3 instead of fat32 huh
[05:31] <LjL> jimb1, then you had already a driver installed. Windows by default definitely doesn+t come with an ext3 driver
[05:32] <AsheD> I was ripping some stuff, set to a certain filesize to maintain quality, doing a 2-pass with the xvid codec, and when the files are done, they seem of decent quality, but they are all like 20% smaller than the size I set
[05:32] <Jimb1> I didnt install it  LjL
[05:32] <Jimb1> it just works
[05:32] <bsnider> is edgy going to get the 2.6.18 kernel?
[05:32] <doogle> Jimb1: if you're accessing the drive remotely, it doesn't matter what filesystem it is, because the local OS will take care of reading and writing it.
[05:32] <LjL> jimb1, uh, wait, so is it an ext3 that you're seeing, or what?
[05:32] <doogle> Jimb1: the problem comes when you dual-boot - then you have to resort to tricks to get windows to read/write ext3 and linux to write ntfs, etc.
=== mow is now known as howang
[05:32] <deeflex> My friend gave me a cd of ubuntu 6.06 I think? the version before 6.10 anyway my problem is that I can't boot the cd the system hangs at "Loading LInux kernel 28%".
[05:33] <bunnythebunny> doogle: well, is it normal for xorg to chew up all my cpu?
[05:33] <Jimb1> LjL im playing an mp3 file that is on the drive I installed ubuntu on
[05:33] <Williamts99> truk77, a quick search of ubuntuforums.org might be good
[05:33] <deeflex> I've tried to set boot parameter mem=512 but still same
[05:33] <doogle> bunnythebunny: that's not normal, no
[05:33] <Jimb1> no windows on that machine at all
[05:33] <doogle> bunnythebunny: can you pastebin the 'top' screen?
[05:33] <bunnythebunny> doogle:its going from very high to very low..
[05:33] <doogle> !paste | bunnythebunny
[05:33] <ubotu> bunnythebunny: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:33] <Jimb1> im accessing from another windoz box
[05:33] <bunnythebunny> Ok illt ry.
[05:34] <Jimb1> i never installed a driver for ext3 on the windows box
[05:34] <doogle> bunnythebunny: you can run "top -d .3" or some such to get top to update every 0.3 seconds.
[05:34] <gbutler69_> Anyone know anything about 'chrooted' environments? Why does 'chroot foo', and then type 'tty' give 'not a tty'??
[05:34] <gbutler69_> [11:28]  Anyone know a way around this 'not a tty' thing for 'chroot'?
[05:34] <Jimb1> so, im thinking it was a mistake using fat32 for the second hd on the ubuntu machine
[05:34] <doogle> Jimb1: the remote windows box talks smb to the ubuntu box, and the ubuntu box uses the linux kernel's ext3 driver to access the HD.  windows isn't 'speaking' ext3, it's speaking 'smb'
[05:35] <doogle> Jimb1: if you don't intend to run windows *on* your ubuntu machine, then you don't need to use fat32 on it, no.
[05:35] <Williamts99> truk77, actually, searching on there and the wiki come up with nothing, so that might be a really good sign that nobody is having issues with ubuntu on it. :-)
[05:35] <tuskernini> doogle, ok cu and thanx a million
[05:36] <doogle> bye tuskernini
[05:36] <truk77> Williamsts99: well, it's also (I think) a pretty new model, but I guess I'll just get the latest ubuntu version and say "go" and see what happens
[05:36] <Jimb1> doogle...I thought I needed to to be able to read from the windows boxes but maybe i should format hdb1 to ext3 also
[05:36] <ruinevil> I C U FIRSTSTRIKE
[05:36] <Jimb1> thought i needed fat32
[05:36] <deeflex> My friend gave me a cd of ubuntu 6.06 I think? the version before 6.10 anyway my problem is that I can't boot the cd the system hangs at "Loading LInux kernel 28%". I've tried to set boot parameter mem=512 but still same.
[05:36] <FirstStrike> ahhhhh
[05:36] <bunnythebunny> doogle: ive done it.. should i download the text then?
[05:36] <Jimb1> bbl
[05:36] <bunnythebunny> doogle: or i dont know..
[05:36] <Williamts99> truk77, also, there are compatability pages, if everything works out perfectly on it, might want to mention it on there.
[05:37] <Yggdrasil> i havea wierd qeustion what the hell is a lamp server ?
[05:37] <doogle> bunnythebunny: no, just tell me the URL at the top of the browser
[05:37] <KenSentMe> !lamp | Yggdrasil
[05:37] <ubotu> Yggdrasil: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[05:37] <bunnythebunny> doogle: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31944/

[06:34] <TokenBad> segfault_, it comes up...but don't contain windows

[06:34] <oslo> doogle> i want to repair all different .par2 files with one command like a unrar all files which ends by .rar with "rar e *.rar"
[06:34] <segfault_> TokenBad, u will need to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add an entry for windows
[06:34] <admin123> slavi1, excuse my errors, keyboard issues here
[06:35] <TokenBad> segfault_, I understand that...but is there info on how to?
[06:35] <zntneo> anyone have any clue?
[06:35] <quiet> there's a sample already there to uncomment
[06:35] <quiet> just adjust the partition number.
[06:35] <zntneo> does that mean i have the SMP kernel?
[06:35] <segfault_> TokenBad, google
[06:35] <doogle> oslo: how about: for i in *.rar do par2 r something.par $i; done
[06:35] <quiet> zntneo, yes.
[06:35] <slavi1> pam?
[06:36] <TokenBad> segfault_, I know that to...but not sure what to search for
[06:36] <zntneo> I shouldn't have that because i'm not on a computer with more then 1 processor
[06:36] <quiet> zntneo, if you don't need smp... then install  linux-image-2.6-686  (or whatever)
[06:36] <quiet> zntneo, hyer threading?

[06:36] <zntneo> nope

[06:36] <slavi1> admin123: I haven't messed with pam
[06:37] <zntneo> i don't believe so

[06:37] <zntneo> no i don't see that
[06:37] <quiet> zntneo, using an smp kernel on a non-smp machine won't hurt anything... you just don't need it.

[06:39] <zntneo> fi tried that it says t couldn't find any package named that
[06:39] <renin> Can anyone help me with a mounting issue? I have two SATAs can't be read and mounted by Kubuntu.
[06:39] <segfault_> TokenBad, apparently not because serching for grub windows in google yeilds results that will likely solve ur issue
[06:39] <oslo> doogle> u have a xxx.par2 file with other files like xxx.part**+**.par2 for a set or only rar files.
[06:39] <quiet> zntneo, search linux'image
[06:39] <quiet> linux-image
[06:39] <doogle> oslo: so just run "par2 r xxx"
[06:39] <TokenBad> segfault_, I was thinking of the commands...sorry
[06:39] <doogle> oslo: that will repair all files
[06:39] <Doow> do I have to do anything special to mount ntfs rw? change some module for the kernel or so?
[06:40] <zntneo> it says linux-image-86 is obsoleted by linux-image-generic
[06:40] <adam_> wazzup!

[06:40] <ubotu> Doow: ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710

[06:41] <oslo> doogle> look, 3 main par files for 3 differrent set of files: like 1xxx.par2, 2xxx.par2 & 3xxx.par2 if i run par2 r *x.par2 it will repair only one set of files !
[06:41] <zntneo> hmm it lookks like my wireless card is having an addrconf
[06:41] <Poromenos> segfault_: it's telling me it can't move directories
[06:41] <zntneo> what ever that means
[06:41] <specialbuddy> does anyone know how to change the permissions of a portable harddrive?
[06:42] <Poromenos> segfault_: no, wait, it isn't :(
[06:42] <zntneo> Does anyone know how to fix that?

[06:42] <Poromenos> zntneo: assign it a different address, probably
[06:42] <adam_> Genjuro, are you currently trying to go thru a router?
[06:42] <oslo> but with 3 differents  files 1x.rar & 2y.rar & 3z.rar ; rar e *.rar will extract all 3 differrent rar files
[06:42] <zntneo> how do i do that
[06:42] <Genjuro> yes
[06:42] <oslo> do u understand ?
[06:42] <admin123> slavi1, a look at it in a bit

=== shade-smoking-af is now known as shadeofgrey
[06:42] <adam_> Genjuro, the pppoe should only be held in the router settings, configure your wireless or nic as dhcp

[06:43] <slavi1> admin123: could you please pm any info? I am at work and my job involves leaving my desk a lot ...
[06:43] <specialbuddy> does anyone know how to change the permissions of a portable harddrive?
[06:43] <Genjuro> adam_ when scans for a modem the pppoeconf crashes my kernel
[06:43] <Genjuro> adam_ i put another ethernet card, but the problem continues
[06:44] <adam_> Genjuro, pppoe doesnt use a modem here...
[06:44] <doogle> oslo: I don't think the par2 command can work on more than one set of files at a time, but you can write a loop in bash that will run par2 multiple times
[06:44] <adam_> Genjuro, im on verizon fios, with pppoe, i have it configured in the router, then just jump on it via dhcp
[06:44] <Genjuro> Genjuro, i'm from brazil...
[06:44] <slavi1> specialbuddy: to apply permissions recursively?
[06:44] <pianoboy3333> Can anyone here help me with using git?

[06:45] <specialbuddy> slavil, I can't change them at all
[06:45] <adam_> Genjuro, no, i do not know that modem.
[06:45] <slavi1> specialbuddy: as in you want all files to be readable and such?

[06:46] <doogle> oslo: like this? for i in *.par2; do if [[ $i != *.vol*+* ] ] ; then par2 r "$i"; else echo ignoring $i; fi; done
[06:46] <adam_> Genjuro, can you configure the router to see the modem?
[06:46] <Megatron> ciao come faccio x una chat italiana

[06:47] <jeronim> any idea why /etc/sysctl.conf in edgy appears not to have any effect?
[06:47] <zliners> i mean hello sory fergot its the english channel my bad :d
[06:47] <jenda> Ctrl and Super work perfectly.
[06:47] <adam_> Genjuro, yes i do understand you. ubuntu should not care about it being pppoe, it should just jump on it via dhcp, if not, then there should be a package you need for pppoe

[06:50] <MidMark> someone has problem with dvd with one session see as blank?
[06:50] <VR_> another question: does it matter in which order the partitions are created? i see some people have /, swap, then /home, etc.
[06:50] <adam_> Genjuro, and its not configureable? is it finding your nic?
[06:50] <seraphim_> VR_: that doesn't matter
[06:50] <Genjuro> adam_ no no
[06:50] <VR_> ok
[06:50] <Genjuro> adam_ it's crases when i execute
[06:50] <adam_> Genjuro, so, its not finding your network interface card?
[06:51] <Genjuro> adam_ i put sudo pppoeconf
[06:51] <lsproc> VR_: I have my / partition, then swap, but i have some NTFS before that too :P
[06:51] <Genjuro> adam_ the kernel opens the program
[06:51] <Laggeon> bonjour
[06:51] <adam_> Genjuro, i understand, but if it doesnt know what your ethernet card is, it will crash
[06:51] <VR_> lsproc: yeah, i have 60GB to spread out, but im not really sure how to divide it up
[06:51] <Genjuro> adam_ the program found my 2 interfaces

[06:53] <VR_> btw, why do i need a separate /boot?
[06:53] <adam_> Genjuro, do you see that?
[06:53] <Genjuro> adam_ yes
[06:53] <adam_> Genjuro, have you followed it?
[06:53] <seraphim_> VR_: because you can then mount it read-only, which provides some security
[06:53] <Genjuro> adam_ i'm follow
[06:53] <adam_> Genjuro, ok
[06:53] <Genjuro> adam_ let me see this
[06:53] <adam_> Genjuro, ok, good luck
[06:53] <VR_> mmmhm
[06:53] <lsproc> VR_: Plus you can keep your grub stuff in case of reinstall
[06:53] <VR_> 2gb is enough for swap, right?
[06:54] <VR_> oh ok
[06:54] <zliners> oke is there a java expert here ?
[06:54] <lsproc> VR_: Old rule of thumb was double the installed
[06:54] <VR_> how about the new
[06:54] <seraphim_> if you got enough ram, half of it is enough too
[06:54] <lsproc> VR_: There isnt one, I just use that (goes back to days of RedHat 9)
[06:54] <seraphim_> i got 1gig ram and swap nearly isn't touched
[06:54] <seraphim_> so i only have 512mb
[06:55] <tokenbad> segfault_, ok I found some info but question...how do you know what to put for the hd0,0 info...my windows in on the hdc1 partition
[06:55] <tokenbad> segfault_, for grub I mean

[06:57] <tokenbad> segfault_, yes...I tried hd0,3 but not work

[06:57] <tokenbad> segfault_, 2,0 or 3,0....

[06:57] <Genjuro> adam_ but, i'm have a dapper drake cd here
[06:58] <adam_> Genjuro, my suggestion, would be to download the new edgy, and install that via upgrade, then try
[06:58] <segfault_> tokenbad, would be hd2,0, grub drive and partition numbering begins at 0

[07:13] <Limulf> I want Ubuntu (6.10) to start without opening any windows from its previous use, so I have changed my session configuration, unchecking the save session changes automatically option.

I have tried to remove the gnome-session-properties from the current session tab in the session manager
[07:13] <Limulf> window,  but after closing and opening again the session manager, the gnome-session-properties program is again there. This is hardly an annoyance, but I would like to know the solution anyway. Thanks for your time and work.

[07:14] <Limulf> nolimitsoya: Thx, I'll do that right now :)
[07:14] <jenda> bunnythebunny: please use the pastebin
[07:14] <skelter> what is the command line to open nautilus to a certain directory?
[07:15] <Don-DiZzLe> I want to permanently mount an XFS partition called /dev/sdb1, what is the correct entry in fstab?
[07:15] <nolimitsoya> !pastebin | bunnythebunny
[07:15] <ubotu> bunnythebunny: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:15] <jenda> skelter: nautilus <directory>
[07:15] <dooglus> Limulf: isn't there an option to ask whether to save the session when you log out?
[07:15] <skelter> nevermind
[07:15] <skelter> lol yeah i should have just tried that ebfore asking
[07:15] <CheshireViking> krampo & sloughi: Just tried msn between to windows machines and that doesn't work either, must be an microsoft/msn fault - surprise, surprise
[07:15] <jenda> My alt key isn't working. It doesn't work in most key combinations, but works with F12 for tomboy, and with Ctrl+Backspace for X restart. It has a xev response, obviously, but won't do any work. I am on XGL.
[07:15] <HoY1> does anyone have s-video working with Ubuntu?
[07:15] <krampo> :)
[07:15] <nolimitsoya> bunnythebunny, look under monitor then
[07:15] <Don-DiZzLe> I want to permanently mount an XFS partition called /dev/sdb1, what is the correct entry in fstab? anyone anyone?
[07:16] <nolimitsoya> bunnythebunny, xorg.conf realy isnt that big ;)
[07:16] <nolimitsoya> Don-DiZzLe, /dev/sdb1 /<mount/point/> -t xfs defaults 0 2
[07:16] <Limulf> dooglus: I don't see that option when I logout. Anyway i'm going to try nolimitsoya's advice. Thx
[07:17] <dooglus> Don-DiZzLe: /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mount-point xfs defaults 0 0
[07:17] <Sikon> how to make VMware use the system GTK instead of its own?
[07:17] <dooglus> Lobster: go for it.
[07:17] <Don-DiZzLe> well which one is it?
[07:17] <Don-DiZzLe> and how do u know that?
[07:17] <skelter> what argument do i pass nautilus to have it open to the same thing that double clicking "computer" does?
[07:17] <Lobster> hu?
[07:17] <tonyyarusso> I have a problem mounting a USB external hard drive on a Dapper machine running the server kernel image (no device even registers in /dev)- has anyone run into this?
[07:17] <nolimitsoya> Don-DiZzLe, the -t in my line is reduntant, otherwise they are identical :)
[07:17] <bunnythebunny> nolimitsoya, I have looked under both of them, theres nothing. Thats what making me insane. Besides the extreme ultra uber boggedness this system has. It makes windows look like an eficient fast system. but yes, nothing under monitor that indicates a refresh rate thingy. Im going to recheck.
[07:17] <dooglus> Don-DiZzLe: it's my one :)  "man fstab"
[07:18] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: redundant?  or incorrect?
[07:18] <Sarkie> How do i start gnome without sound or mouse enabled?
[07:18] <nolimitsoya> dooglus, i dont think id do any damage, but i have never tried it :)
[07:18] <nolimitsoya> *itd
[07:18] <skelter> the -t used to be required for specifying the file system type, no?
[07:19] <skelter> i think it is legacy
[07:19] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: according to the man page, the 3rd field should be the system type, not "-t" - that's not a system type
[07:19] <bunnythebunny> this is what ive got under monitor: Identifier	"L1718S"   Option		"DPMS"
[07:20] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: when I tried it, it told me "[mntent] : line 22 in /etc/fstab is bad"
[07:20] <nolimitsoya> dooglus, then its not only redundant, but wrong. happy? :)
[07:20] <dooglus> skelter: you're probably thinking of the 'mount' command, not the fstab file
[07:20] <zliners> how do i compile an svn of java in ubuntu ?
[07:20] <thevenin> what would cause saslauthd to return nothing after doing ehlo localhost
[07:21] <skelter> i was, you're right.
[07:21] <thevenin> i did telnet localhost 25 before that command
[07:21] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: an admission of guilt isn't enough.  I'll need a full apology I'm afraid.  ;)

[07:22] <siegie> hi i have a problem with mail notification, i see regularly that it is using 100 % of my cpu in edgy
[07:22] <Don-DiZzLe> thats a nautilus bug
[07:22] <dooglus> jessicafl: I would try deleting the file from the cache and re-running whatever you're running ( /var/lib/apt/lists/ )
[07:26] <minimec> jessicafl: If you are upgrading to edgy you can deactivate this source. It's a dapper source.
[07:26] <henna_> evening dad
[07:26] <jessicafl> bunnythebunny + ubotu: That's when I get the error.  When I do the 'gksu "update-manager -c"'

[07:27] <minimec> jessicafl: If you are upgrading to edgy you can deactivate this source. It's a dapper source.
[07:27] <siegie> bunnythebunny: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg (and than i says xorg not found?)
[07:27] <Don-DiZzLe> ok i read it but what does 'dump'  mean then?
[07:28] <dooglus> Don-DiZzLe: 'dump' is for doing backups.
[07:28] <dooglus> Don-DiZzLe: if you don't use 'dump' then that field doesn't matter
[07:28] <Don-DiZzLe> so its a good this to have it on?
[07:28] <jessicafl> minimec: I had to reconnect.  I just saw  your last comment about deactivate this source.  How can I do this?  Thanks!
[07:28] <dooglus> Don-DiZzLe: it's good to make backups, but I doubt you're using 'dump'
[07:28] <Don-DiZzLe> indeed
[07:28] <henna_> evening Noah0504
[07:29] <minimec> jessicafl: you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list and make a # in front of this source, or you can do it in the menu of synaptic.
[07:29] <jessicafl> awesome! thanks
[07:29] <DShepherd> anyone know a text editor that supports folding?

[07:31] <birdfish> Does anyone know why "ifconfig > ifconfig.out" would render a 0-bit file?
[07:31] <lullabud> henna_:  are you a real person?
[07:31] <lullabud> alecjw:  did you try iwconfig?
[07:31] <henna_> who are you lullabud?
[07:32] <bunnythebunny> Is it possible that edgy didn't configure my graphic drivers probably and now the whole system is extremely slow?
[07:32] <lsproc> birdfish: No, but try | tee or something...
[07:32] <bunnythebunny> And if so, i just have to get the nvidia linux drivers, from Nvidia right?
[07:32] <alecjw> lullabud: yes. it returns some info about my config, but that's all
[07:32] <godstand2> invaild driver arrrrrrrgh
[07:32] <henna_> yep
[07:32] <godstand2> i have a 2wire wireless pcmcia card on a laptop i have tried step by step and it states in term it is a invaild driver
[07:32] <jessicafl> minimec or anyone: I see deb and deb-src that have 'dapper-updates' in them, but they don't have the whole url...(with packages.gz included).  I'm guessing I should disable deb (not -src), but will I lose out on bug fix updates?
[07:33] <godstand2> have been at this for 3 weeks
[07:33] <alecjw> lullabud: but it says Access Point: Not-Ascossiated, could that be a problem?
[07:33] <DShepherd> lullabud: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_folding
[07:33] <lullabud> alecjw:  yeah, read the man page about how to associate with an AP using iwconfig
[07:34] <henna_> who of you can speak a little bit dutch???
[07:34] <dooglus> jessicafl: you shouldn't see full urls.  and you need "deb" but not "deb-src" unless you want to download source code

[07:35] <jessicafl> dooglus: I'm trying to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 but during upgrade it says http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz is not gzip and fails it.

[07:35] <jamesbrink> anyone know why the bcm43xx driver wont scan ?

[07:35] <jamesbrink> yeah
[07:35] <mo> when i'm trying to boot windows, i get "Grub Error 13: Invalid or unsupported executable format" what can i do?

[07:36] <alecjw> lullabud: i don't have any security
[07:36] <lullabud> mo:  boot to the livecd and do `grub-install`
[07:36] <jamesbrink> well i know it works in gentoo
[07:36] <jamesbrink> im new to ubuntu im gona check the kernel settings i guess
[07:36] <dooglus> jessicafl: well, the thing is, http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz is in gzip format, so it must be your local cached copy which isn't
[07:36] <godstand2> ok can some one help me get the 2wire wireless to work please
[07:37] <mo> segfault_, lullabud: my grub works. i can boot xubuntu properly. shoud i reinstall grub anyway?
[07:37] <lullabud> mo: no reason not to. ;-)
[07:37] <jessicafl> dooglus: Thanks, I'm new to Ubuntu if you can't tell already :) How can I clear the cache?  The only cache I know how to clear is FireFox'.
[07:37] <Sikon> jessicafl> what cache?
[07:37] <mo> lullabud: can i reinstall grub from within xubuntu?
[07:37] <Sikon> and it's Firefox, not FireFox
[07:37] <godstand2> please
[07:37] <lullabud> mo: if it's working fine though, try re-installing right from within ubuntu, not the livecd.
[07:37] <segfault_> mo, read that info maybe will help u find ur issue, ur windows entry is likely wrong, as grub sounds like it is installed correctly
[07:38] <alecjw> lullabud: dhclient tries to use wmaster but i want to ude wlan0, i hve the line auto wlan0 in /etc/network/interfaces file
[07:38] <mo> lullabud, segfault_: thanks
[07:38] <bunnythebunny> I need to exit X. how do i do that?
[07:38] <jessicafl> Sikon: jessicafl: well, the thing is, http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz is in gzip format, so it must be your local cached copy which isn't (that's what I'm trying to do).
[07:38] <jessicafl> Sorry about Firefox.
[07:38] <lullabud> alecjw:  it should all interfaces that are up.
[07:38] <alecjw> ok, thanks, lullabud
[07:38] <dooglus> jessicafl: run:    sudo rm -f /var/lib/apt/lists/*
[07:38] <alecjw> i'll try it#
[07:38] <lullabud> alecjw:  i know you can specify an interface with pump using `pump -i wlan0` or `pump -i eth1` or whatever.
[07:38] <jessicafl> ok! thanks dooglus
[07:39] <henna_> cann't any one tell me if there is a possiblity to play board games overhere
[07:39] <dooglus> henna_: you're a program aren't you?
[07:40] <lullabud> dooglus:  that's what i say.
[07:40] <mo> lullabud: simply sudo update-grub and sudo grub-install /dev/sda?
[07:40] <lullabud> mo: yeah, that should suffice.
[07:40] <bunnythebunny> Please, someone, tell me how i can close the x interface
[07:41] <mo> lullabud: ok, thanks. i will try it
[07:41] <bunnythebunny> Or fill me in the right terminology
[07:41] <dooglus> bunnythebunny: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[07:41] <bunnythebunny> thank you dooglus
[07:41] <narvik86> bunnythebunny: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[07:41] <narvik86> :)
[07:41] <henna_> see you all
[07:41] <bthornton> This is not directly Linux related, but does anybody know of some [somewhat]  widely accepted standard for embedding mathematical formulas in email?  Does Evolution have any tools for that?
[07:41] <henna_> bye
[07:42] <jessicafl> dooglus: that did the trick!  thanks a LOT!  I'm starting the upgrade and it said to close my apps, so I'll be back later.  thanks again!!! :)
[07:42] <LjL> bthornton, i think MathML is part of the HTML standard by now, and there exists such thing as HTML emails (unfortunately)
[07:42] <alecjw> lullabud: dhclient only checked wmaster, even if i left it to finish
[07:42] <lullabud> alecjw:  do you see wlan0 if you do `iwconfig` ?
[07:42] <bthornton> LjL: sweet; I'll look into that. Thanks!
[07:42] <henna_> who are you any way, dooglus?
[07:43] <alecjw> lullabud: yes.
[07:43] <mo> lullabud: my grob-problem is not solved... :(
[07:43] <minimec> jessicafl: dapper-updates means update for the dapper distro (6.06). Since you are upgrading to edgy, forget this source. You don't need it anymore.

[07:55] <timo90> iM NOT playing with the bots
[07:55] <henna_> see you all
[07:56] <LjL> timo90, yes you are. if you want to find out factoids for yourself, do it in a private query.
[07:56] <Seeker2599> whats the command to unpack a .tar.gz?
[07:56] <jackyyll> hi, where do i find the file that has all the menus app launchers in it? (The applications , places, and system menus)
[07:56] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Seeker2599 about tar
[07:56] <Seeker2599> !tar
[07:56] <ubotu> Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde) - also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[07:56] <dooglus> Seeker2599: tar xf <file>
[07:56] <aktiwers> how can I set Xchat to autologin to my account?
[07:56] <Seeker2599> ty dooglus
[07:57] <timo90> OK
[07:57] <lullabud> aktiwers:  it's in the server settings
[07:57] <lullabud> aktiwers:  there's an option to issue commands when you connect to a server.
[07:58] <aktiwers> Hmm I cant seam to find it? :/
[07:58] <LjL> aktiwers: just set a server password
[07:58] <Skyrail>  hmm, I was just on the Internet on my other PC when all of a sudden none of the sites would load, I tried closing Firefox and opening it again but no luck, so I restarted but still it wouldn't work then after a few minutes of refreshing the page it worked but with no styling, few more refreshes and it worked, any ideas?
[07:59] <aktiwers> Could you give me step by step? Im pretty much a noob to IRC
[07:59] <fredl> hi, are there any known screensaver problems that cause GNOME to be completely unresponsive to the keyboard?
[07:59] <aktiwers> Would be nice
[07:59] <LjL> aktiwers: no, 'cause i use konversation
[07:59] <aktiwers> :)
[07:59] <Trixsey> How do I cd to the CD? :p
[07:59] <aktiwers> ahhh
[07:59] <Trixsey> cd = change dir, CD = compact disc
[07:59] <LjL> Trixsey: cd /media/cdrom most likely
[07:59] <Trixsey> in my case :p
[07:59] <Trixsey> oh ok
[07:59] <LjL> course it has to be mounted
[07:59] <fredl> I think it's because of the screensaver, as I sit here working all dat and no problems at all. I come back after dinner and some TV or so and my entire keyboard is locked up.
[07:59] <aktiwers> or cd /media/cdrom0 or whatever number it has
[08:00] <LjL> aktiwers: yes, cdrom is a symlink to cdrom0 here though
[08:00] <aktiwers> ahh ok :)
[08:00] <jackyyll> is there a file that has all the Applications menus app launchers in it?
[08:00] <aktiwers> anyone remember the command then, for loggin in? (here on IRC)
[08:00] <LjL> aktiwers: /msg nickserv identify <password>
[08:00] <aktiwers> thanks LjL!
[08:01] <Trixsey> whats the command to copy?
[08:01] <Trixsey> like.. copy a folder?
[08:01] <Trixsey> I couldn't mv them
[08:01] <Trixsey> lol
[08:01] <jackyyll> cp -r
[08:01] <LjL> Trixsey: cp
[08:01] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Trixsey about cli
[08:01] <jackyyll> nobody knows an answer to my question? :/
[08:02] <lullabud> jackyyll:  i think the answer is no.
[08:02] <jackyyll> :/
[08:02] <Zambezi> Anybody know how to build a debfile from source?
[08:02] <fredl> jackyyll, it's entirely possible that somebody does but not everybody pays attention here :)
[08:02] <jackyyll> lol
[08:02] <jackyyll> well, do you know the answer fredl? ;p
[08:02] <aktiwers> LjL when using that login "command" I get this message?  No channel joined. Try /join #<channel
[08:02] <LjL> Zambezi: dpkg-buildpackage
[08:03] <seraphim_> Zambezi: you can do it easyly with checkinstall. but that won't take care about dependecies
[08:03] <fredl> jackyyll, I just scrolled up to see if I could find your question but I couldn't. Can you ask again?
[08:03] <LjL> aktiwers, you must not use the "<" ">", those were only there as quotes. /msg nickserv identify your-password
[08:03] <jackyyll> Is there a file somewhere where all of the "Applications" Menus app launchers are stored?
[08:03] <LjL> jackyyll, i think it might be the /usr/share/applications directory, i'm not sure
[08:03] <kmaynard> or /usr/bin
[08:03] <Zambezi> seraphim_, I know the dependecies.
[08:03] <aktiwers> ahh ok..  I figured out :) THanks!
[08:03] <GazzaK> hello, can anyone tell me the terminal command to renew my dhcp settings - mostly the dns settings, as they do not seem to want to work correctly
[08:04] <fredl> jackyyll, yes there is.
[08:04] <Trixsey> trixsey@trixsey:~/Desktop$ sudo chmod -c 7777 projects
[08:04] <Trixsey> mode of `projects' changed to 7777 (rwsrwsrwt)
[08:04] <Zambezi> LjL, I'll try. Are you here awhile more?
[08:04] <jackyyll> fredl, and which file would that be? :p
[08:04] <lullabud> GazzaK:  dhclient
[08:04] <Trixsey> Still can't do anything in projects.. why :(
[08:04] <kmaynard> jackyyll, what's your goal?
[08:04] <LjL> Zambezi: not for long, almost dinner time
[08:04] <lullabud> GazzaK:  i prefer `pump` though, but it's not there by default.
[08:04] <fredl> jackyyll, like LjL says, /usr/share/applications
[08:04] <seraphim_> Zambezi: with checkinstall you have to have all dependencies, ./configure and make and then use checkinstall instead of make install
[08:04] <UmbraAdmin> hiho ppl
[08:04] <jackyyll> kmaynard, i'm trying to get all the launchers so i can edit them manually
[08:04] <kmaynard> LjL, dinner? where are you? :)
[08:04] <LjL> kmaynard: italy
[08:05] <kmaynard> italia!
[08:05] <kmaynard> sweet
[08:05] <Trixsey> mi bella
[08:05] <fredl> hello UmbraAdmin
[08:05] <UmbraAdmin> If i have a hd with Ubuntu on it how do i move that hd to a new comp without Linux going into panic ?
[08:05] <jackyyll> ah, thank you
[08:05] <GazzaK> lullabud~ what does that command do? (it seemed to run though okay)
[08:05] <kmaynard> jackyyll, edit them how? ubuntu has a menu editor
[08:05] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, you open the case, you insert the disk.
[08:05] <UmbraAdmin> lol
[08:06] <UmbraAdmin> did that and linux panic
[08:06] <jackyyll> kmaynard, i know, but i wanted to edit them in gedit or soemthing
[08:06] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, is this a second drive?
[08:06] <lullabud> GazzaK:  dhclient is just the standard dhcp client.  `pump` is more of a dhcp lease manager.
[08:06] <UmbraAdmin> is the kernel specifik to the old comp
[08:06] <rexykiko> what is the best way to do LTSP with ubuntu?
[08:06] <UmbraAdmin> like cpu and such ?
[08:06] <GazzaK> it worked lullabud thank you very much
[08:06] <lullabud> GazzaK:  all i know is that pump has never done me wrong
[08:06] <lullabud> GazzaK:  de nada
[08:06] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, in some cases yes. If you try to run an AMD kernel on an Intel one this *could* cause problems.
[08:06] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, is this a second drive?
[08:07] <UmbraAdmin> the old comp was P3 the now one P4
[08:07] <UmbraAdmin> its the main drive
[08:07] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, that shouldn't really cause a problem then. What does the kernel say before it bombs out?
[08:07] <GazzaK> hehe, lullabud I just had to google that saying :-) de nada to you too.
[08:07] <UmbraAdmin> i dont have the exact mess but it say PANIC
[08:08] <Discerer> Hmm I have a problem: the wireless networking card I have doesn't even show up in network-admin. on lspci it's "Marvell technology 88w8335", but that is not mentioned on the wiki. ideas?
[08:08] <UmbraAdmin> i can try again and make a note
[08:08] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, most likely because it can't find the root filesystem. Do you get GRUB to start up and does it let you select a kernel?
[08:08] <Shinta> how do i compile java with terminal?
[08:08] <ProN00b> how can i disable bug buddy ?
[08:08] <rexykiko> what is the best way to do LTSP with ubuntu?
[08:08] <UmbraAdmin> Grub starts
[08:08] <fredl> Shinta, with javac ofcourse.
[08:09] <Shinta> thad dous not work
[08:09] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, well then you should be able to edit the kernel parameters for your kernel.
[08:09] <UmbraAdmin> it goes through decrompressing kernal
[08:09] <LjL> !doesn't work
[08:09] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[08:09] <UmbraAdmin> hmm
[08:09] <Shinta> :)
[08:09] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, so you can tell the kernel to use another root filesystem although if this was a first drive on your old system and is still the first drive on your new system nothing should have changed.
[08:09] <Rob125> lmao
[08:10] <fredl> Shinta - can it not find javac ?
[08:10] <UmbraAdmin> Sorry to ask but how do i edit the kernal settings ?
[08:10] <fredl> Shinta, or does it not work?
[08:11] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, read what's on your screen when you have the GRUB image. use some arrow keys to prevent GRUB from autobooting fast enough for you not to be able to read the instructions.
[08:11] <nuts7> hey
[08:11] <nuts7> how do I make a whole directory with all flags I got in my home directory??
[08:11] <Shinta> Yes it can find it but cant get it to work ( i am used to eclipse (ant))
[08:12] <fredl> Shinta, javac bla.java
[08:12] <UmbraAdmin> ok thx ALOT fredl i try
[08:12] <Shinta> hmm oke
[08:12] <Shinta> il try
[08:12] <fredl> UmbraAdmin, this is #ubuntu BTW, not #java. You might want to try asking things related tto #ubuntu.
[08:12] <fredl> ehr
[08:12] <fredl> Shinta.
[08:13] <UmbraAdmin> hmm
[08:13] <UmbraAdmin> isnt this related to Ubuntu ?
[08:13] <UmbraAdmin> more then java anywhy ;-)
[08:13] <fredl> yes it is, I corrected myself, this was to Shintu :)
[08:13] <UmbraAdmin> ahh
[08:13] <UmbraAdmin> hehe
[08:13] <fredl> Shinta even.

[08:15] <martyyyr> can I install the grub bootloader from the live cd?
[08:15] <LjL> !lts | rexykiko, is this that you mean?
[08:15] <ubotu> rexykiko, is this that you mean?: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[08:15] <nuts7> how do I give all possible flags to a directory? chmod -R .. ?!
[08:15] <mseney> Discerer, i just got my wifi card working after i edited the /etc/network/interfaces file
[08:15] <fredl> fulldisclosure, edit /etc/passwd
[08:15] <rexykiko> Ljl, no; I mean Linux Terminal Server Project
[08:15] <Flannel> nuts7: why do you want to do that?
[08:15] <fredl> fulldisclosure, I would not recommend it though.
[08:16] <mseney> Discerer, do you see the interface when you $iwconfig
[08:16] <LjL> nuts7: "all possible flags" meaning what, everybody can do everything on all files and subdirectories recursively?
[08:16] <easytiger> chmod -R 777 nuts7
[08:16] <nuts7> Flannel: I moved a directory from my NTFS partition to my EXT3 home directory.. but now I can edit the files
[08:16] <Discerer> no mseney
[08:16] <fulldisclosure> ok
[08:16] <fredl> chmod -R 7777 actually
[08:16] <mseney> Discerer, sorry then..my first day back to linux :)
[08:17] <Discerer> :p
[08:17] <fredl> nuts7, -R will do it recursively to all files in the directory as well
[08:18] <martyyyr> can I install the grub bootloader from the live cd?
[08:18] <fredl> martyyyr, yes.
[08:18] <fredl> martyyyr, I'm not sure how but it can be done. Google for GRUB and you'll find it.
[08:19] <Shinta> witch file do i shoose ? javac ????? of the source dir ?
[08:19] <lullabud> martyyyr:  grub-install /dev/hda
[08:19] <thechitowncubs> sorry to repeat, but...
[08:19] <thechitowncubs> whats the best source to read to learn how to set up a 10 user samba fileserver with each user having his or her own directory and also a public directory accessible by all users
[08:19] <lullabud> martyyyr:  you may need to replace hda with sda, or whatever your hdd is.
[08:19] <martyyyr> lullabud: will that work if there is a wdinows partition too?
[08:19] <lullabud> martyyyr:  yeah, it installs to the MBR, which is outside of the partitions.

[08:21] <lullabud> martyyyr:  mount your hard disk

[08:22] <fredl> :)
[08:22] <lullabud> martyyyr:  anywhere.  `mkdir hda1 ; mount /dev/hda ./hdaa`
[08:22] <lullabud> martyyyr:  holy hell that was an awful typo...
[08:22] <lullabud> martyyyr:  `mount /dev/hda1 ./hda1`  the idea is to get your hard disk mounted somewhere that grub-install can read the boot files.
[08:22] <martyyyr> where hda1 is a partition..right?
[08:22] <lullabud> martyyyr:  then do `grub-install /dev/hda --root-directory="./hda1"`
[08:23] <lullabud> right.
[08:23] <fredl> lullabud, mount needs an absolute mount path does it not? :)
[08:23] <martyyyr> so I should mount the /boot partition?
[08:23] <Shinta> oke about thad compileing the nfo is included in a .xml file with the folowing line :  <property name="build.dist" location="${build}/dist"/>
[08:23] <lullabud> fredl:  nope
[08:23] <Shinta> how do i compile thad ?
[08:23] <fredl> hmm
[08:23] <fredl> Shinta: this is NOT #java ok?
[08:24] <martyyyr> do I mount the partition where I put my /boot  ?
[08:24] <lullabud> martyyyr:  can you rephrase that?
[08:24] <fredl> Shinta: just trying to help you as you won't get many answers to your questions about Java here most likely.
[08:24] <martyyyr> lullabud:  I have 4 partitions:  windows, /boot, /, and /home
[08:25] <martyyyr> which one should I mount?
[08:25] <lullabud> martyyyr:  oooh, well do it like this then... `mkdir boot ; mount /dev/hda# ./boot`
[08:25] <baastrup> my new logitech G5 usb laser mouse dossent work in ubuntu 6.10
[08:25] <lullabud> martyyyr:  then do `grub-install /dev/hda --root-directory="./"`
[08:25] <fredl> baastrup, does Linux see the USB device?
[08:25] <martyyyr> alright, I'll give it a go
[08:25] <baastrup> fredl: dmes sees it

[08:26] <baastrup> fredl: yes and evdev is installed too
[08:26] <baastrup> when I do a cat /dev/input/mice i get data
[08:26] <ikus1> hello al im kinda a noob with linux, but im trying to change that. Can anyone tell me where I can find the basic command lines?
[08:26] <Shinta> fredl i am working in ubuntu ... ?
[08:27] <nekr0z> Hello guys, I seem to need a little help here.
[08:27] <fredl> baastrup, Hmm. sorry work calls.
[08:28] <baastrup> fredl: thx for trying
[08:28] <lullabud> martyyyr:  the idea is to mount your boot partition as boot, then give --root-directory to the place where that boot partition is mounted.
[08:28] <lullabud> martyyyr:  that way grub-install finds the right files and doesn't complain.
[08:29] <nekr0z> After I've gone Edgy, I cannot use cyrillic keyboard layout in some programs, incl. Gedit. Though it works for firefox or terminal, for example. Does anyone have a clue?
[08:29] <ikus1> no one has a link to the basic command lines for linux?
[08:30] <lullabud> ikus1:  http://www.pixelbeat.org/cmdline.html
[08:30] <martyyyr> so if the boot partition is mounted in /mnt/boot  then I do    sudo grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory="/mnt/boot"  ?
[08:31] <lullabud> martyyyr:  no, --root-directory="/mnt"
[08:31] <neighborlee> I have mplayerplugin installed  and 32bit swiftfox, but swift isn't seeing it and wondering is anyone else having this problem ? ( or do I need to install plugger alongside theese)
[08:31] <martyyyr> ok..
[08:31] <martyyyr> and it will find the windows partition too?
[08:31] <nekr0z> ikus1, I do, but it's in Russian
[08:31] <lullabud> martyyyr:  what this is going to do is install grub.  you'll have to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst to boot up windows.
[08:31] <lullabud> martyyyr:  ubuntu comes with some example configs for windows.
[08:32] <lullabud> martyyyr:  the main thing is that "hd(0,0)" needs to be changed to hd(harddisk#,partition#)
[08:32] <lullabud> martyyyr:  so hd(0,0) is first hard disk, first partition.
[08:32] <martyyyr> I see
[08:32] <martyyyr> and you mean the menu.list  in  /mnt/boot/grub , right?
[08:32] <aktiwers> neighborlee If you use Automatix, you can get it to install all the plugins for Swiftfox.. as long as you install it in /opt/swiftfox
[08:33] <lullabud> martyyyr:  that's right

[08:33] <martyyyr> after editing that list, do I have to let grub know that I edited it?

[08:33] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl

[08:34] <lullabud> martyyyr:  just put my name somewhere in the line...
[08:35] <aktiwers> neighborlee hmm.. thats odd.. it works fine here. Sorry, this is the way I did it and it works. I have no idea then.. maybe you will have to install them manually then :/
[08:35] <martyyyr> lullabad, yeah, sorry about that.. I keep forgetting
[08:35] <neighborlee> aktiwers, well mplayerplugin had to be intsalled via  synaptic as it doesn't come with automatix
[08:35] <lullabud> martyyyr:  lullabUd :P
[08:35] <martyyyr> lullabud.. lol, sorry!
[08:35] <lullabud> martyyyr:  no, you don't have to let it know you updated the file.  once you install it pointing to that location you can change the file
[08:35] <aktiwers> neighborlee: oh.. I didnt know.. its been long since I did this
[08:35] <martyyyr> lullabud, ok, thanks.. I'm gonna give this a go
[08:36] <neighborlee> aktiwers, ah ok np

[08:40] <Archngel> can someone direct me for detail information on edgy server or can someone help me in here
[08:40] <martyyyr> lullabud: nope, just 1
[08:40] <lullabud> martyyyr:  or do you have any other disks in the system, like a floppy?
[08:41] <martyyyr> lullabud: a cdrom and a floppy, but my BIOS is set to boot from the hd.. as it always has
[08:41] <bluefox83> i've never heard of beryl before..is it any good?
[08:41] <Pelo> Archngel, try the forum if no one else answers you
[08:41] <Rob125> bluefox83: it's got its perks
[08:41] <martyyyr> lullabud, the problem started after I installed ubuntu
[08:41] <nekr0z> Rob125: I can use my russian layout in Firefox or OpenOffice.org, but I cannot in Gedit or Evolution.
[08:41] <lullabud> martyyyr:  huh... windows xp?
[08:42] <bluefox83> Rob125, what kind of perks? will amarok work on it/
[08:42] <Rob125> nekroz: i'd be willing to bet the problem is that you're using an incompatible font
[08:42] <Rob125> what's amarok again? i forget.
[08:42] <martyyyr> lullabud, what do you mean?
[08:42] <bluefox83> media player
[08:42] <elknof1_> aloha everybody
[08:42] <Rob125> dunno
[08:42] <Rob125> i've not had any problems with programs
[08:42] <lullabud> martyyyr:  what windows OS are you running?
[08:42] <bluefox83> it wont work with compiz, that much i know for a fact
[08:42] <elknof1_> hey does anyone knows how to upgrade amarok to 1.4.4??
[08:42] <nekr0z> Rob125: amarok is the world's best music player
[08:42] <martyyyr> lullabud: XP
[08:42] <bluefox83> nekr0z, i agree :D
[08:42] <lullabud> martyyyr:  also, what's the layout of your partition table?  can you print it out and put it in a pastebin?
[08:42] <Rob125> the perks are that it's pretty and akamaru works great with it
[08:42] <variant> bluefox83: search you tube fo aiglx or beryl
[08:42] <Discerer> how do I go to a computer in my network in the file browser? in windows it would be for instance \\kekeklol but how about linux?
[08:43] <nekr0z> Rob125: Need to check that out, never had an idea.
[08:43] <bluefox83> whats aiglx anyways?
[08:43] <quiet> Discerer, //kekeklol
[08:43] <lullabud> Discerer:  smb://computername/sharename
[08:43] <variant> bluefox83: 3d accelerated xserver
[08:43] <martyyyr> lullabud:  I used to have a gentoo installation and a windows xp installation, seperated by GRUB
[08:43] <Archngel> Pelo thx but Ive tried that already,, trying to solve the conenction with xp client to edgy PDC  ,, cant connect,, would need review of smn.conf from a knoledgeable person :)
[08:43] <bluefox83> variant, cool
[08:43] <elknof1_> amarok is an excelent audio player for kde
[08:43] <lullabud> martyyyr:  are you sure your partition table is valid?
[08:43] <quiet> Discerer, you should also be able to just go to network browser and find it.
[08:43] <martyyyr> lullabud, I installed ubuntu over the gentoo one, and now everything is messed up
[08:43] <Discerer> thanks
[08:43] <DrNick> I'd just like to say, massive thumbs up to ubuntu 6.10. its by far the best linux distro i've used - I run both the desktop and server versions. (on different machines)
[08:43] <Rob125> nekr0z: google video has some stuff of it, the dock itself is called 'kiba'
[08:43] <martyyyr> lullabud... how do I check that?
[08:44] <Discerer> not in the same workgroup, should it work anyway quiet?
[08:44] <Pelo> anyone know the hard way of playing around with file association ?
[08:44] <DrNick> its currently running very well on a 550Mhz laptop with only 196Mb of RAM. as well as on my main desktop system, and a server
[08:44] <bluefox83> variant, aiglx isn't in the repository either?
[08:44] <variant> !gvidcap
[08:44] <lullabud> martyyyr:  print it out and put it in a pastebin and i'll look at it.  or just verify that you don't have more than 3 primary partitions
[08:44] <quiet> Discerer, linux will display the workgroup name for you to click on and browse.
[08:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gvidcap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[08:45] <master0onxbox> somebody that can point me to the right channel for rtorrent support throw ubuntu server consol`?
[08:45] <lullabud> martyyyr:  i wonder if it's a corruption issue with the partition table...
[08:45] <Rob125> nekr0z: weird. the only problem i've had with primitive greek is diacritis, nothing with entry
[08:46] <Pelo> later folks
[08:46] <subiet> banshee help with lyrics plugin, anyone???????
[08:46] <Rob125> have you googled for possible solutions?
[08:46] <martyyyr> lullabud: do you think it would help if I'd format all the partitions except for the windows 1?
[08:46] <master0onxbox> somebody in here that can point me in the right direction for some channel for rtorrent support throw ubuntu server consol`?
[08:46] <master0onxbox> yepp
[08:47] <lullabud> martyyyr:  likely not.  if there's a problem it's probably with the partition table itself.
[08:47] <master0onxbox> and I found the user guide.. but not the solution to me problem
[08:47] <nekr0z> Rob125: At least I tried to google it up. Maybe I haven't given it enough try?
[08:47] <lullabud> martyyyr:  you might be able to fix it by imaging all of your partitions, repartitionining, then restoring.
[08:47] <martyyyr> lullabud: great....:/ :)
[08:47] <Recon69> hi, have a problem with my nvidia driver setup, opengl dev is not setup correctly , I can get apps to compile that use opengl by installing the synaptic nvidia - dev package , but they wont runn as the lib and the driver dont match, any suggestions on ho i should fix this?
[08:47] <Rob125> nekr0z: well, it wouldn't surprise me if there was nothing there. there's not a lot of good support in english for languages, AFAIK.
[08:48] <nekr0z> Rob125: I'm not even talking about compose key not working at all after my edgy upgrade.
[08:48] <Doow> pelo, does automatix produce any logs or such? couldn't help but noticing it's removing some packages... =)
[08:48] <martyyyr> lullabud, how do I print out my partition table?
[08:48] <nekr0z> Rob125: Hell right you are
[08:48] <lullabud> martyyyr:  yeah. =/  that's the worst kind of problem, partition problems.  but it may be something else.
[08:48] <lullabud> martyyyr:  cfdisk -P s /dev/hda
[08:48] <Rob125> doow: automatix logs in ~/automatix.log
[08:48] <Doow> Rob125, ok, ty

[08:49] <gnu2it2> what is the trick to getting scp1 ?
[08:49] <Rob125> nekr0z: if you find a solution, let me know. i'll start compliling a guide to common language problems, now that i know i'm not the only one with the probs.
[08:49] <lullabud> martyyyr:  LOL, i'm trying this out on this system i have at home, and now i'm scared looking at my own partition table... windows vista has torn this thing to pieces twice.
[08:49] <martyyyr> lol
[08:50] <bluefox83> how do i get firefox to stop using the totem plugin? i want it to use mplayer instead...

[08:50] <Joe_SWAU> Hi, I get an error that says (Failed to Initialize HAL!). This happens when I reboot my laptop, but it doesn't seem to affect anything. Can someone help me with this?
[08:50] <Discerer> hmm modinfo ndiswrapper tells me ndiswrapper exists but when trying to use it it tells me command not found, ideas?
[08:50] <master0onxbox> okey my q. Why does rtorrent terminat all my downloads when I shut down the terminal?
[08:50] <liri> uhmm, how do I check which version of the module ipw3945 is installed?
[08:50] <timo90> is this command write for dvb
[08:50] <nekr0z> Rob125: Ok. The thing is, this problem looks gnome-specific (doesn't appear in qt-apps, nor in login screen), and I'm not that good at gnome setup
[08:50] <Doow> Pelo, Rob125, now it's working thanks
[08:51] <javaJake> I need a variable (LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH) to be set for all apps.

[08:51] <baastrup> is there a way to stress test a nvidia grafic card
[08:52] <lullabud> martyyyr:  ah, you might need to toggle the bootable flag on one of those partitions.
[08:52] <lullabud> martyyyr:  on my system, only the NTFS is set to be bootable.
[08:52] <Rob125> nekr0z: can't say that I've had the problem - again, though, I just use classical greek.
[08:52] <martyyyr> lullabud: it was like this (2 boot flags) when I had gentoo running, and it worked
[08:52] <javaJake> I need a variable (LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH) to be set for all apps. "export LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/dir" doesn't cut it, because it only works for the current terminal.
[08:52] <javaJake> Any ideas?
[08:52] <martyyyr> lullabud: look at the 4th partition tho,  the type says Primary... is that right?
[08:52] <lullabud> martyyyr:  really?  you were using grub with it?
[08:52] <nekr0z> Rob125: Thank you for trying to help anyway.
[08:52] <martyyyr> lullabud: yeah, grub
[08:53] <Rob125> nekr0z: sorry I couldn't be of any. Best of luck finding a fix.
[08:53] <lullabud> martyyyr:  yeah, i think that's ok.

[08:57] <javaJake> so-dee-day...
[08:57] <lullabud> martyyyr:  you could install grub onto a floppy disk and boot that way.
[08:57] <iter> ikus1: sudo -s
[08:57] <javaJake> ikus1, run sudo "command"
[08:57] <fryfrog> ikus1: use "sudo" before any commands you want to do

[08:57] <javaJake> lullabud, Sorry, I'l stop.

[08:59] <eugman> How do I get ubuntu to recognize my memory stick pro.
[08:59] <martyyyr> lullabud: I'm not sure, but I can find out
[08:59] <lullabud> martyyyr:  i've had better luck doing the default partition, letting the ubuntu installer do its thing.
[08:59] <martyyyr> lullabud: if I would have done that, my windows partition would have been lost
[09:00] <ron_> My Wireless connection comes up in System -> Administraton -> Networking as Wired Connection wlan0
[09:00] <pip> which program can make many .rar files to 1 .img files like winrar does in windows?
[09:00] <lullabud> martyyyr:  well, it lets you resize partitions to make empty space.
[09:00] <fryfrog> pip: that'd be "unrar" :/
[09:00] <lullabud> martyyyr:  that's true though, with that complex scheme it might do something funky.
[09:00] <UmbraAdmin> if i move my hd with Ubuntu on it to a new comp and get -> Kernel panic - not syncing:VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0) What todo ?
[09:01] <pip> fryfrog:  i can already do it in ubuntu?
[09:01] <fryfrog> pip: and its compression, and if the .rar files don't *contain* a .img file (say, it has a .bin/.cue file or .iso file) you'll end up withs omething else at the end :/
[09:01] <lullabud> UmbraAdmin:  that's likely caused by having your hard disk physically attached to the computer in a different configuration.
[09:01] <Discerer> the HD is not set up to handle ubuntu UmbraAdmin
[09:01] <UmbraAdmin> hmm
[09:01] <fryfrog> pip: i dunno, does the command "unrar" at a prompt say anything?  I think I noticed automatix2 installing unrar for me
[09:01] <ikus1> thanks I made a account ;) any tips on how to delete the account again?
[09:01] <UmbraAdmin> but it works in the old comp ?
[09:01] <Atoms> hi, i have two soundcards, one is onboard other is audigy, in ubuntu default soundcard is that onboard, how can i change order of soundcards ?

[09:02] <UmbraAdmin> yeas lullabud
[09:02] <martyyyr> lullabud, I'm reinstalling ubuntu and got rid of a few partitions (only primary partitions left now)... I hope it works
[09:02] <UmbraAdmin> Atoms disable the onboard in bios
[09:02] <lullabud> UmbraAdmin:  i'm pretty sure that error is from your initrd being unable to mount your root partition.

[09:05] <eugman> scratch out that starting word.
[09:05] <pip> hmm, think so since i cant get vlc without the universal with apt
[09:06] <bluefox83> ok...by login screen does not have an option for beryl..how do i fix that?
[09:06] <pip> but i get an error when i do apt-get update

[09:07] <WonderWal> how do i install packages from dapper? im using edgy. i need to install erlang R10 due to a bug.
[09:07] <lullabud> AsheD:  like `ls -la filename` or `stat filename` or `file filename` ?
[09:07] <SupremacyGnu> Hello! I just downloaded a .run package. But I can't run it. Ubuntu want's to open it with my gedit, which I guess is wrong? and sh filename.run doesn't seem to work either.
[09:08] <lullabud> SupremacyGnu:  `bash ./whatever.run`
[09:09] <AsheD> lullabud:: yeh something like that, I am looking for the exact dimensions of a video from a DVD, if that helps
[09:09] <Discerer> how do I terminate a program that's locked up?
[09:09] <WonderWal> :(
[09:09] <hamdinp> what is default ROOT password installed ubuntu 6.6.1
[09:09] <lullabud> AsheD:  `file` would be your best bet.
[09:09] <mnepton> SupremacyGnu: chmod +x filename.run
[09:09] <pip> fryfrog: automatix is like a better apt-get?
[09:09] <jackrazz> anyone know what's wrong with this script, i'm a newbie
[09:09] <jackrazz> #! /bin/sh
[09:09] <jackrazz> sudo -s -u postgres
[09:09] <jackrazz> pg_ctlcluster 8.1 main start
[09:09] <lullabud> hamdinp:  there is no root user in 6.06.1
[09:09] <lullabud> !sudo
[09:09] <adam_> what are some of the bennies for automatix?
[09:09] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:09] <mnepton> pip: please do not use Automatix
[09:09] <pip> why?
[09:10] <fryfrog> pip: no, automatix just uses apt to install some other stuff
[09:10] <WonderWal> im using edgy. how do i install a package from dapper?
[09:10] <mnepton> because if it fails in the *slightest* way it can render a machine unusable
[09:10] <fryfrog> mnepton: you suggest something else?
[09:10] <SupremacyGnu> hmm, I seem to have somekind of MD5 checksum error....
[09:10] <lullabud> SupremacyGnu:  perhaps the file didn't finish downloading?  try downloading it again.
[09:10] <WonderWal> :'(
[09:10] <pip> but i cant even find automatix when im apt-cache searching?
[09:10] <Atoms> ok, have another try -- i have two soundcards, one is onboard other is audigy, in ubuntu default soundcard is that onboard, how can i change order of soundcards ?
[09:10] <pip> ir there some thing wrong then?
[09:10] <pip> is*
[09:11] <fryfrog> pip: did you read what i said in channel?
[09:11] <SupremacyGnu> lullabud, gah, I waited 30 minutes for this...well, thanks anyways
[09:11] <pip> ive done an update?
[09:11] <lullabud> SupremacyGnu:  you may be able to resume the download.
[09:11] <Discerer> how do I terminate a program that's locked up?
[09:12] <ron_> I have a Prism contrller
[09:12] <ron_> Controller
[09:12] <ron_> houldn't that work?
[09:12] <SupremacyGnu> lullabud, It's already finished
[09:12] <lullabud> SupremacyGnu:  are you sure it's the whole file?
[09:13] <lullabud> Discerer:  you can use kill or killall
[09:13] <lullabud> Discerer:  if it's a gui app you can use xkill
[09:13] <hamdinp> what is default ROOT password installed ubuntu 6.6.1
[09:13] <hamdinp> but folder owner is root
[09:13] <SupremacyGnu> lullabud, yes, must be a bad filehost
[09:14] <lullabud> SupremacyGnu:  lame...
[09:14] <thevenin> hamdinp: do sudo passwd root
[09:14] <AsheD> my DVD drive has eaten itself
[09:14] <Discerer> thanks lullabud!
[09:14] <AsheD> I can't access it, can't unmount it :(
[09:14] <SupremacyGnu> lullabud, yep, I'm trying to download true combat elite, but their link is broken... and the other site is on french and I don't have "permission" to download from there...
[09:15] <SupremacyGnu> lullabud, so yes... kinda lame
[09:16] <timo90> Can any one asist me in installing  and configureing my pic DVB-T card, im using gxine
[09:16] <hamdinp> thevenin: hamdinp: do sudo passwd root
[09:16] <hamdinp> tthanks
[09:16] <hamdinp> its work
[09:16] <CHICOL> sudo /connect irc.hispano.org
[09:17] <pip> mnepton: why shouldent i get automatix?
=== webben is now known as webben-sups
[09:17] <thevenin> np
[09:17] <LjL> pip: because it's known to break systems.
[09:17] <pip> so i shouldent get it?
[09:17] <LjL> !automatix
[09:17] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[09:18] <pip> ok i wont use it then, but fryfrog told me to get it
[09:18] <thevenin> nessus does the same
[09:18] <pip> and all i want is to unrar some files to get an .img file and watch a movie :(
[09:18] <thevenin> broke one my my boxs had to reinstall made me very mad
[09:19] <LjL> pip: enable multiverse and install unrar
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[09:19] <pip> multiverse?
[09:19] <pip> ive only enables universe i think
[09:19] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell pip about multiverse
[09:19] <thevenin> ubuntuguide.org
[09:19] <LjL> !unrar
[09:19] <ubotu> unrar is rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression  There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[09:19] <cfedde> My network admin group insists on locking switch port speeds.  How do I tell ubuntu to set 100BaseTX-FD at boot?
[09:20] <pip> sry gnome got an critical error?
[09:20] <pip> what homepage did you write where i could read about filecompression?
[09:20] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell pip about unrar
[09:21] <thevenin> www.ubuntuguide.org
[09:21] <LjL> what about ubuntuguide?
[09:21] <pip> and i cant read dvds either, and ive unlocked that think too i think
[09:21] <LjL> !dvd
[09:21] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html  -  libdvdcss can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[09:21] <thevenin> it would tell him how to add mutliverse
[09:22] <LjL> thevenin: so would the documentation i just pointed him to
[09:22] <master0onxbox> terminal help with rtorrent somebody?
[09:22] <LjL> which is the documentation from ubuntu.com
[09:22] <pip> and how did i enable multiverse?
[09:22] <pip> sry but my xchat crashed!
[09:22] <thevenin> oh well
[09:22] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell pip about multiverse
[09:22] <thevenin> 2 answers is better then no answers
[09:23] <pip> LjL:  imba m8 :)
[09:23] <rambo3> cfedde, did you try nictools-pci
[09:24] <cfedde> rambo3: thanks. I'll look there.
[09:24] <assarix> hi
[09:24] <alanhaggai> Hi friend :)
[09:24] <assarix> is there a php5 package with mysql support in the repository?
[09:24] <assarix> I can't find one
[09:24] <thevenin> man this channel has enough bans eh
[09:24] <anderbubble_> assarix, you install php5, then php5-mysql
[09:24] <rambo3> cfedde, its bunde of alot of utils . you need to find one for your card
[09:24] <assarix> yes
[09:24] <erUSUL> !find php-mysql
[09:25] <ubotu> Package/file php-mysql does not exist in edgy
[09:25] <assarix> but phpinfo() doesn't show mysql
[09:25] <LjL> !info php5-mysql
[09:25] <ubotu> php5-mysql: MySQL module for php5. In component main, is optional. Version 5.1.6-1ubuntu2.1 (edgy), package size 22 kB, installed size 108 kB
[09:25] <LjL> or perhaps you could use PEAR
[09:25] <assarix> and php.ini does have mysql.so in it
[09:26] <cfedde> rambo3: idealy I was looking for some boot time script to call mii-tool.
[09:26] <thomas_> do you guys think that getting a dual core processor, is worth the exra price? will i see a real benifit under linux?
[09:26] <JohnM555> Does anyone here use Eclipse? I have Eclipse installed, but when I run it(from Applications>Programming>Eclipse) I get "An error has occurred. See the log file /home/john/workspace/.metadata/.log." However, the .metadata folder isn't even created, so I can't even look at the log file.
[09:26] <rambo3> cfedde, make it your self?
[09:26] <cfedde> rambo3: maybe.
[09:27] <JohnM555> Would I need to run Eclipse with sudo...? And if so, how?
[09:27] <cfedde> rambo3: one of the things I
[09:27] <cfedde> 've learned to like about ubuntu is that most of what I'm looking for is already there.

[09:27] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[09:28] <LjL> look just above pip
[09:28] <JohnM555> How do I run a program(Ecliose) from the terminal?
[09:28] <JohnM555> Eclipse*
[09:28] <pip> so i cant apt-get install !dvd?
[09:28] <LjL> JohnM555: if i have to take a wild guess... type "eclipse"
[09:28] <LjL> pip: *no*
[09:29] <LjL> read the guide on that link instead
[09:29] <JohnM555> Ljl: Probably shoulda tried that :P
[09:29] <pip> thanks
[09:29] <thevenin> LjL: may i ask how do you keep you sanity?
[09:29] <martyyyr> argh.... I just spent hours on trying to get my bootloader to work, while it was just my HD that didn't power on!
[09:30] <cpl-tnt44> Hi all , i try to make a user with ubuntu : sudo useradd lisa for exsample ... where is the home folder for lisa's user ?
[09:30] <LjL> thevenin: one part of my brain is devoted to simulating a parallel universe where i kill all their computers and then them
[09:30] <thevenin> lmao
[09:30] <zntneo> how do i get network-manager to work?
[09:30] <cpl-tnt44> LjL a little helpo plz ?
[09:30] <JohnM555> Eh, that still doesn't fix my problem. When I run Eclipse I get the error  "An error has occurred. See the log file /home/john/workspace/.metadata/.log.", but that file is never created
[09:30] <zntneo> I already have it installed
[09:30] <zntneo> with apt
[09:30] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: /home/lisa
[09:30] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: but no
[09:31] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: the command you need is "adduser" not "useradd"
[09:31] <cpl-tnt44> LjL , i know but it didnt create one...
[09:31] <cpl-tnt44> mmm
[09:31] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: delete the user and try again with adduser
[09:31] <LjL> user "deluser" to delete
[09:31] <LjL> s/user/use/
[09:31] <cpl-tnt44> in linux's books  its useradd strange
[09:31] <jamey> I have done a minimal install on an old box but it now hangs on "Configuring networking..." Any ideas?
[09:31] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: then those books will also explain that useradd doesn't create a home directory by default. anyway, on Ubuntu, use adduser
[09:32] <cpl-tnt44> LjL : either way its working but not creating a folder for the user thats strange ?
[09:32] <LjL> no it's not, it's not supposed to
[09:32] <cpl-tnt44> heheh Thanks !
[09:32] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: if you read the manpage ("man useradd"), it'll tell you there is an option that you have to explicitly invoke, to create a home directory
[09:32] <LjL> but anyway, don't, and just use adduser instead
[09:33] <cpl-tnt44> ok !
[09:33] <cpl-tnt44> thanks
[09:33] <cpl-tnt44> btw LjL what is Room number ? in the values ?
[09:33] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: unimportant to the system
[09:33] <LjL> your choice, you can leave them blank as well
[09:34] <cpl-tnt44> and for administrator ?
[09:34] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: hm?
[09:34] <cpl-tnt44> nm
[09:34] <cpl-tnt44> i just relized its a bounch of info on the user.... if u'd like to enter
[09:34] <LjL> exactly
[09:35] <motin_> hellooo!! i am upgrading to edgy! one question only - I am downloading the 1.5 gig packages needed right now, but I really would like to restart my computer - how can I make the downloaded packages stay on the computer after I press cancel?
[09:35] <LjL> motin_: they will.
[09:36] <jamey> motin_, why do you need to restart?
[09:36] <LjL> also, be sure you read
[09:36] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell motin_ about upgrade
[09:36] <motin_> jamey: need to use a windows app for school
[09:36] <jamey> ah right
[09:37] <LjL> motin_, just cancel the download (as long as it's still just downloading, *never* interrupt if it's installing)
[09:37] <sidewalk`> how do i get sshd running in ubuntu?
[09:37] <LjL> sidewalk`: install openssh-server
[09:37] <sidewalk`> ahh, it isnt installed per default?
[09:37] <LjL> no
[09:37] <motin_> LjL: that's great and probably what I though, but also, the upgrader claims to "restore" my system if I press cancel, so I wasnt sure
[09:37] <hamdinp> Hey ! Is Ubotu bot?
[09:37] <Rob125> ,ptom
[09:37] <jamey> I have done a minimal install on an old box but it now hangs on "Configuring networking..." During the setup stage when it is configuring the base system, ethernet worked and could ping domains. How can I get it to work again?
[09:37] <Rob125> motin: if it's only downloading, you should be able to safely run things using wine
[09:37] <LjL> motin_: uhm, perhaps there's some black magic that the updater does. but i am close to 100% sure that the downloaded packages will stay cached
[09:38] <ekimus> anyone using portsentry? I configured it to use KILL_ROUTE=iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j DROP but when I portscan the box from somewhere outside it doesn't react. it says the box is already blocked but nowhere any action....
[09:38] <motin_> Rob125: if only the app would run over wine
[09:38] <motin_> :)
[09:38] <Rob125> alas, indeed.
[09:38] <zntneo> Hello i have an ip address for my wireless card but i still do not have internet access with it anyone have any idea?
[09:39] <gnu2it2> cb01
=== Hit3k_ is now known as Hit3k
[09:39] <motin_> LjL: I'll risk trying :)
[09:39] <LjL> ekimus, i'm not familiar with portsentry, but that iptables command looks like it would drop any incoming packet that's not already part of a connection without a second thought
[09:39] <LjL> so i guess portsentry wouldn't even ever get to see them
[09:39] <zntneo> anyone?
[09:39] <jamey> zntneo, can you ping your router?
[09:40] <ekimus> LjL:  that's what portsentry should issue _after_ it saw suspicious packets, so no need to care about it any more. it should be dropped
[09:41] <LjL> ekimus: i see
[09:41] <zntneo> jamey: right now i'm on the laptop that has the wireless is on
[09:41] <zntneo> is there a way i can make the ping go through the wireless
[09:41] <zntneo> with out disconnecting my ethernet
[09:42] <jamey> zntneo, I don't think you understand: pinging is just an act of sending a packet over your network connection
[09:42] <DeadFlash> I have a little USB flash drive that I can't get to mount, it says there is no fs on in, but if I load it on another computer, it says the fs is FAT, any ideas?
[09:42] <jamey> zntneo, as in... your wireless - which I presume is the only network connection
[09:42] <LjL> jamey, i think the issue is that he's got two interfaces running - the wireless and an ethernet
[09:42] <jamey> LjL, good call
[09:42] <liri> If I'm working with 2.6.15-27-686 do I need the linux-386  package?
[09:42] <jamey> zntneo, so disable eth0 or eth1 in the network config app
[09:42] <LjL> why can't you just disconnect the ethernet zntneo?
[09:43] <jamey> or that
[09:43] <zntneo> LjL: then i'll loose my connection to the chat
[09:43] <thevenin> lol
[09:43] <jamey> haha
[09:43] <LjL> zntneo: well, disabling it will have the same effect. you could set a route
[09:43] <DeadFlash> or is there a way to just tell my kernel to recompile?
[09:43] <LjL> like "route add IP-address-of-your-router dev name-of-your-wifi-interface"
[09:44] <LjL> e.g. "route add 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0"
[09:44] <zntneo> maybe i'll try disabling my eth0 real quick again and test if its working then come back in
[09:44] <LjL> though i'd still just try with the ethernet disconnected tbh
[09:44] <LjL> zntneo, if you're fast enough, chances are your IRC client (or the server) won't even notice a disconnection
[09:45] <dcordes> how can i accept a file transfer in licq?
[09:45] <jamey> please can someone help me with my networking problem?
[09:46] <thevenin> jamey: what is your networking problem?
[09:46] <jamey> thevenin, this is it:
[09:46] <jamey> I have done a minimal install on an old box but it now hangs on "Configuring networking..." During the setup stage when it is configuring the base system, ethernet worked and could ping domains. How can I get it to work again?
[09:46] <cpl-tnt747> LjL : how can i change passwords for 5 diff users at the same time ?
[09:47] <YoussefAssad> hello
[09:47] <alanhaggai> Hi friend :)
[09:47] <dcordes> which port does icq use to transfer files?
[09:47] <thevenin> jamey: you can not boot at all it freezes when configuring networking
[09:47] <YoussefAssad> How do I know what CPU arch I have? Says here Pentium M 740, but what is that, P4? Pentium M? Celeron?
[09:47] <nebajoth> I answered a series a questions during Ubuntu Edgy Eft Installation regarding keyboard layout, and now I have weird shift-key behaviour.  How do I change this back to normal?
[09:47] <thevenin> cpl-tnt747: do it individually
[09:47] <LjL> cpl-tnt747, not sure you can
[09:48] <jamey> thevenin, yes it goes through the boot scripts fine until that point and then freezes - no response via keyboard etc
[09:48] <zntneo> ok i'm on it right now
[09:48] <zntneo> ok i'm back
[09:48] <YoussefAssad> oh, cpuid takes care o' that.... nm
[09:48] <thevenin> hrm, i am not quite sure what would cause that sorry, maybe try and boot disconnected from the network
[09:48] <LjL> jamey: that should be the point when it's trying DHCP...
[09:48] <zntneo> ok i'm back
[09:49] <zntneo> damn't i didn't try some brb again
[09:49] <hamdinp> Are anybody install 7zip?
[09:49] <cpl-tnt747> LjL : u know something like cr8ing a password file .. and use chpasswd < pwlist (which is the file we created )
[09:49] <jamey> LjL, yes I think so... I forgot to mention that I tried changing /etc/network/interfaces to a static config since it didn't do it via DHCP.
[09:50] <Maggotin> Hello
[09:50] <alanhaggai> Hi friend :)
[09:50] <LjL> cpl-tnt747, very bad idea to keep plaintext passwords in a file anyway
[09:50] <Maggotin> Dumb question, what's the command to display a cow on terminal? xD
[09:50] <LjL> jamey, tried ctrl+c?
[09:50] <LjL> Maggotin: apt-get moo
[09:50] <Maggotin> Thanks!
[09:51] <zntneo> LjL: This is what it is showing in dmesg over and over again
[09:51] <zntneo> wlan0: tx error 0x20, buf 10!
[09:51] <zntneo> but with different ending numbers
[09:51] <cpl-tnt747> LjL : we only use the pass file for the change ...  after that we deleting it
[09:51] <jamey> LjL, yes I did a couple of times but it never seemed to skip that step or it would skip all steps before it and then continue with "Confguring networking..."
[09:51] <LjL> no clue, have no wireless here
[09:52] <LjL> cpl-tnt747: doesn't matter, the data is still written to the disk, and deleting the file doesn't remove that
[09:52] <nebajoth> I answered a series a questions during Ubuntu Edgy Eft Installation regarding keyboard layout, and now I have weird shift-key behaviour.  Especially with quotations.  I have to hit shift twice to get a double quotation mark, etc.  I believe it has something to with it being an international keyboard layout, but I am not sure how to change it back.
[09:52] <LjL> jamey: is it "configuring network" or "configuring network interfaces"? and is it usplash or a text-mode boot? (guess the latter)
[09:53] <jamey> LjL, it's configuring network and text mode (server/minimal install)
[09:53] <Rob125> nebajoth: go 'system -> preferences -> keyboard'
[09:53] <cpl-tnt747> LjL the passwords are there no matter what u do only now there not encrypted
[09:53] <nebajoth> I did
[09:53] <nebajoth> I tried fiddling with it
[09:53] <nebajoth> and nothing doing
[09:54] <LjL> cpl-tnt747: precisely... if you do it the standard way, there are just hashes. if you put them in a plaintext file, they're there unencrypted
[09:54] <cpl-tnt747> there have to be a way managing 100 users password and reseting them all ?
[09:54] <Rob125> neba: then go to layouts, add the standard one you want, and delete the bad, no?
[09:54] <cpl-tnt747> LjL : there have to be a way managing 100 users password and reseting them all ?
[09:54] <CharlieSu> Has anyone an encrypted /home partition?
[09:54] <nebajoth> Rob125: the problem is I cannot find the one I want
[09:54] <nebajoth> theres US English Alternative international
[09:54] <Rob125> neba: which're you looking for?
[09:55] <GeForce> damn this sucks, I'm trying to install VLC, or ffmpeg.... neither will work as "some required packages are not installable"
[09:55] <nebajoth> or US English International
[09:55] <GeForce> :(
[09:55] <nebajoth> or Dvorak, or Russian
[09:55] <jkimball4> what is the path for system-wide symbolic links?
[09:55] <nebajoth> anything that makes my keyboard work like a standard American 104-key keyboard
[09:55] <nebajoth> without crazy internationalized characters
[09:55] <nebajoth> 
[09:55] <nebajoth> pssht
[09:56] <LjL> cpl-tnt747, so you want to give all users the same password?
[09:56] <thevenin> cpl-tnt747: have you read the man page on passwd
[09:56] <Rob125> neba: just add the 'us english' without expanding the tab and picking one
[09:56] <thevenin> --all or something along the lines might be helpfull to you not quite sure
[09:56] <thevenin> well -a sorry
[09:56] <nebajoth> aha

[09:57] <nebajoth> Rob125: that did it.  "THANK YOU" "MY" "FRIEND".
[09:57] <nebajoth> omg, I missed you, double quotations
[09:57] <nebajoth> I missed you so much
[09:57] <Rob125> hehe
[09:57] <nebajoth> thanks
[09:57] <Rob125> glad you're reunited, neba
[09:57] <LjL> thevenin nope, it can only be used to show user information, not to change it
[09:57] <jamey> LjL, how do I do single user boot?
[09:57] <cpl-tnt747> Ljl : I want it both ways : reseting all , pet user control with password file
[09:57] <thevenin> oh
[09:58] <MenZa> I try to umount a device of mine, but I get 'device busy', though I'm not using it. How do I force it to umount?
[09:58] <LjL> jamey, either recovery mode, of if that's not there on minimal/server, boot with "init=/bin/sH"
[09:58] <LjL> h even
[09:58] <cpl-tnt747> LjL i think the only way is to cr8 a password file in root and encrypt it ...

[09:58] <alanhaggai> Hi friend :)
[09:58] <TrolLlock> excuse me but im trying to install ubuntu on my computer... but it says something about no root file system... help...
[09:58] <godstand2> none of the ndswrapper crap work for my wire less
[09:58] <Hate> Seems like i'm not the only one wanting help
[09:58] <jamey> LjL, I did actually try recovery mode from GRUB but it performed the same boot step anyway...
[09:59] <LjL> cpl-tnt747: then just boot with init=/bin/sh
[09:59] <Rob125> troll: you need a free space to put ubuntu, with a mount point of '/'
[09:59] <cpl-tnt747> ?
[09:59] <TrolLlock> i did all that
[09:59] <Rob125> ie, a partition
[09:59] <FirstStrike> Anyone have experience with a Dell Inspirion E1505? I know that the wireless normally doesn't work out of the box, but after a fresh install it won't connect to the internet via directly hooking the laptop up to the modem either. In fact, in the connection properties only 'lo' shows up while no eth0/eth1 is available.
[09:59] <FirstStrike> Any ideas?
[09:59] <LjL> cpl-tnt747: apt-cache show makepasswd
[09:59] <Hate> Anyone know how to install ubuntu correctly to boot off of a External USB HDD?
[09:59] <TrolLlock> i got a hdd with 110 gb so it shouldnt be any problems with space
[10:00] <FirstStrike> I'm not too worried about wireless..I just want to get the wired net working
[10:00] <Rob125> does it have windows on it, Trol?
[10:00] <Hate> Anyone know how to install ubuntu correctly to boot off of a External USB HDD?
[10:00] <ernst_jandl> good evening! anyone familiar with HAL? i added some rules to /etc/hal/fdi/policy/preferences.fdi, in order to mount my external usb drive with different options, but hal seems to ignore them...

[10:00] <TrolLlock> yes it does...
[10:01] <Rob125> and do you have a seperate partition for lin and win?
[10:01] <LjL> jamey: then just boot with init=/bin/sh (sorry, already said that but addressed to the wrong guy...)
[10:01] <godstand2> i have done all that the web site said
[10:01] <jamey> LjL, okay thanks np
[10:01] <Hate> Can anyone help me or is this the ignore game?
[10:01] <godstand2> nano nana not
[10:01] <cpl-tnt747> LjL : thank this is handy , but not answering my target and is to change multi user with special password each
[10:01] <LjL> cpl-tnt747, sorry, the /bin/sh bit was for jamey not you (though the apt-cache bit was for you)
[10:01] <slavi1> LjL: my problem also affects the login shell or whatever gdm uses for logging in
[10:01] <TrolLlock> well i was trying to reformat the thing with windows but should i do that before i try to install it? wont if become ntfs that way anyway?
[10:01] <godstand2> the lights are on
[10:01] <TrolLlock> but i do got a partition on 20 gb
[10:02] <Rob125> trol: the easiest way, i find, is to partition when installing
[10:02] <godstand2> but no internet connection
[10:02] <Hate> s
[10:02] <TrolLlock> ok rob
[10:02] <LjL> cpl-tnt747, here the description also says "It can also encrypt plaintext passwords given in a temporary file."
[10:02] <godstand2> even wifi says it has ip address
[10:02] <TrolLlock> ill try installing it on the partition with 20 gb
[10:02] <Hate> Anyone help me?
[10:02] <Rob125> Hate: nope, sorry - if nobody's answering, no one knows the answer.
[10:02] <Rob125> have you done a google?

[10:04] <zntneo> is there anyway i can remove a native driver so i can try ndiswrapper?
[10:04] <LjL> slavi1: the gksudo thing is strange. you could probably try making a support ticket as well, as a bug i'm not sure it'll have much fortune, as long as nobody else can confirm it...
[10:04] <slavi1> LjL: and the password thing, any ideas?
[10:04] <Tomcat_> zntneo: sudo rmmod <driver>
[10:04] <slavi1> LjL: the gksudo is also when I am logging in through gdm

[10:06] <godstand2> is the a wireless tech here?
[10:06] <LjL> unfo: "apt-get remove <package>", and "apt-get autoremove" to remove the rest
[10:07] <LjL> unfo: (that will also remove *other* packages that are not needed anymore, that were installed by *other* removed programs, if any)
[10:07] <Rob125> Trol: yeah, you should use ext3 for linux :)
[10:07] <sjbrown> unfo, also you could do "sudo synaptic"
[10:07] <hamdinp>  apt-get install ./p7zip-full_4.43~dfsg.1-1_i386.deb

[10:10] <juraj> I moved around my partitions, and now dapper won't boot, it's stuck on "waiting for root fs"
[10:10] <LjL> cpl-tnt747: "su - username", but not from the root account
[10:10] <unfo> Hate: maybe use a boot partition on your internal HD?
[10:10] <unfo> a small one.
[10:10] <juraj> do I need to adjust anything except /etc/fstab?
[10:11] <lullabud> Hate:  that might be a hardware problem.  lot's of pc's are unable to boot from external usb disks.
[10:11] <Hate> No space on my internal hdd :(
[10:11] <cpl-tnt747> LjL so from what ?
[10:11] <unfo> Hate: not even 10MB?
[10:11] <jughead> How do I scan for nearby wireless networks?
[10:11] <LjL> cpl-tnt747, from any other account. you could use "su - thataccount" first to move to it without closing the shell
[10:11] <Hate> I have about 2 gigs but its all page disc.

[10:12] <unfo> livingdaylight: if you want to run ubuntu inside windows, you need vmware server. it's freeware. http://www.vmware.com/products/server
[10:12] <juraj> thanks on your reply though
[10:12] <LjL> livingdaylight: it works by black magic. you need a computer.
[10:12] <lullabud> zoople:  look for the "default" line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:12] <zoople> thanks :)
[10:12] <Hate> My BIOS says I can so thats why I am curious.
[10:12] <livingdaylight> unfo, no, its the other way round, i need windows to run in ubuntu
[10:12] <Rob125> juraj: when i did the same, I didn't have to.
[10:12] <slavi1> LjL: why don't you have the magic 'fixit' button?
[10:12] <lullabud> juraj:  not sure, did you change anything else?
[10:13] <LjL> livingdaylight: try vmware-player
[10:13] <livingdaylight> LjL, its not funny, i have a avery small computer
[10:13] <juraj> no, okay, I'll go fix fstab ;)
[10:13] <orangefly> can anyone help with ubuntu server....???....

[10:14] <orangefly> how do i end a connection and login to another account....???....
[10:14] <Rob125> ahh
[10:14] <LjL> livingdaylight, that's no problem, vmware doesn't support it anyway
[10:14] <livingdaylight> LjL, what about qemu, somebody mentioned
[10:14] <LjL> (well it does, very experimentally though)
[10:15] <lullabud> orangefly:  ....with what?
[10:15] <variant> orangefly: with ssh, ctrl d will log you out

[10:15] <orangefly> just file server....
[10:15] <Rob125> variant: weird, what kind of lappy do you have?
[10:15] <Languid> anyone here have a radeon x800 with tv-out working with the fglrx drivers?
[10:15] <LjL> livingdaylight: qemu is free software, contrary to vmware, but it's slower to be honest. it emulates the CPU i think, while VMWare uses the host CPU directly. there's kqemu that speeds it up, but then it's not free software
[10:15] <variant> Rob125: toshiba satellite pro a60
[10:15] <LjL> slavi1: yeah somewhere on launchpad, don't remember exactly

[10:22] <tag> anyone have any pointers?
[10:23] <lullabud> zach634:  if you ssh in, when your session begins you're not attached to a screen session.  you could attach by doing `screen -r pid#`.  then to detach, do ^a^d

[10:23] <sidewalk`> how do i get unrar to work in ubuntu? what package do i install?
[10:23] <nuts> how can I find out which nvidia glx drivers I got installed?!? pls
[10:23] <zach634> woah! wait a sec! does ubuntu-server not come with screen?
[10:23] <mcquaid> nuts launch synaptic and type nvidia in the search

[10:24] <martyyyr> lullabud...
[10:24] <Discerer> so... after reboot my ndiswrapper-enabled wireless card doesn't get an IP from the DHCP router. It worked great just after installing it but stopped working after reboot. ideas?
[10:24] <godstand2> excuse me Lup
[10:24] <martyyyr> lullabud: guess what it was?
[10:24] <mcquaid> nuts, if your in edgy your running 8776
[10:24] <lullabud> martyyyr:  what was it?
[10:24] <tag> LjL: a pointer to a pointer isn't going to help me
[10:24] <martyyyr> lullabud: a stupid BIOS problem! GRRR
[10:24] <tag> LjL: but if you have a pointer to a solution, that might work
[10:24] <mcquaid> sidewalk`, just installed unrar
[10:24] <lullabud> martyyyr:  wtf?  what bios problem?
[10:24] <nuts> mcquaid: yeah well I updated them somewhen because I wanted to use beryl
[10:24] <lupine_85> or nuts: what repo did you use?
[10:24] <nuts> sec
[10:24] <hamdinp> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32002/
[10:24] <lupine_85> or did you use the binary from the nvidia website?
[10:25] <martyyyr> lullabud: my bios didn't recognize my sata disk anymore.. so it never got the chance to get to the bootloader
[10:25] <godstand2> cant figure it out
[10:25] <LjL> tag: NULL isn't a pointer, it's a value. anyway i don't use gnome so i don't really know, but how did that happen? did you do anything that might have caused that? can you right click on the desktop and get a "Create panel" option or somesuch?
[10:25] <lupine_85> godstand2: run "lspci". paste the !1! line that is related to the card
[10:25] <mcquaid> i was about to try the amaranth rep which contains 9629
[10:25] <livingdaylight> variant, sorry, i missed your message, i was downloading vmware already. So, which is better? Obviously, you chose qemu, any particular reason?
[10:25] <mcquaid> anyone try them yet?

[10:25] <nuts> lupine_85: deb http://amaranth.selfip.com edgy lrm
[10:25] <lupine_85> yeah, that'll be 9629 then
[10:26] <tag> Aha
[10:26] <tag> got it
[10:26] <tag> thanks kids
[10:26] <nuts> can I upgrade to the newest in some way lupine_85 ?
[10:26] <mcquaid> lupine_85, how do they work for you? any issues?
[10:26] <lupine_85> nvidia-settings is a GUI app that will show version as well
[10:26] <lupine_85> what, 97xx ?
[10:26] <mcquaid> sidewalk`, sudo apt-get install unrar and your good
[10:26] <nuts> lupine_85: yeah
[10:26] <lullabud> martyyyr:  but you said it worked with that other distro....
[10:26] <zach634> does wget work with ftp links?
[10:26] <lupine_85> all they add is support for the 8xx chipsets
[10:26] <hamdinp> Is there anybody that looking http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32002/
[10:26] <martyyyr> lullabud: yeah it did... it really did...

[10:28] <Gh0sty> mythtv is way too big for just a teve tool :/
[10:28] <LjL> Doow: source repositories are generally enabled by default (at least, the ones corresponding to binary repositories you have enabled)
[10:28] <mcquaid> sidewalk`, click on settings, repositories and make sure multiverse is checked
[10:28] <lupine_85> Doow: copy the line for the repo that has the binary package, but call it deb-src at the beginning instead of deb
[10:28] <lupine_85> that /almost always/ works
[10:28] <mcquaid> sidewalk`, then do reload and then install it

[10:34] <lupine_85> that would be silly. just apt-get source <package>
[10:34] <Doow> ok
[10:34] <lupine_85> apt-get -b source if you want binaries straight away
[10:34] <LjL> cc77: even if they did, that'd guarantee nothing. you need *Ubuntu* packages (and for the right version of Ubuntu)  -  other packages, even if they're .deb, might break your system, or at least not work

[10:47] <MitchM> should work fine?
[10:47] <LjL> no
[10:47] <LjL> you can strip the useless "cat" command though

[10:47] <LjL> anyway why not have a look at that program, it probably does it more efficiently

[10:50] <MitchM> dd if=/mnt/image.img.* ?
[10:50] <shy_> THANX! :D
[10:50] <MitchM> i think if is only good for one source
[10:51] <lullabud> MitchM:  yeah, if stands for "input file"
[10:51] <lullabud> MitchM:  of stands for "output file"
[10:51] <LjL> MitchM: ah so that's *multiple* files?
[10:51] <MitchM> lullabud, I know this; wasnt sure if it would read all "147" files.
[10:51] <Zaehlas> Thanks, dougsko, OK, I'm getting an "unknown network error" when I try to enable the DHCP server.  I've installed the DHCP package, and have both network connections set up.
[10:51] <MitchM> yes.
[10:51] <lullabud> MitchM:  oooooh
[10:51] <MitchM> <source> = 147 files.
[10:51] <MitchM> so its needed.

[10:52] <ademan_> eclipse is giving me: "error notifying a preference change listener. Check log for details", what should i do/has anyone had this before?
[10:53] <LjL> MitchM: for the tenth or so time - NO IT WON'T
[10:53] <MitchM> LjL,  k.
[10:53] <MitchM> LjL, So there is no _viable_ solution without download that program
[10:53] <Zaehlas> No ping problems.  No problems reaching "outside" or "inside" computers.  both network interfaces and NICs seem to work fine, it's just that Firestarter errors when it tries to start the DHCP server, and route traffic between the two interfaces
[10:53] <LjL> MitchM, what about tee?
[10:53] <lullabud> MitchM:  that command would work for sda, but not sdb.
[10:53] <MitchM> LjL, If you have an idea with tee im open for suggestions =)
[10:54] <trappist> pip: if they're named like foo.part01.rar, foo.part02.rar and so on, just unrar x foo.part01.rar

[10:54] <shy_> I'm having troubles getting a netwok card to work. It's a Belkin F5D5000ef with a Realtek RTL8139 chipset. This seems to be a quite popular chip, so I'm surprised 6.10 doesn't support it out of the box. Can anybody get me up to speed?
[10:54] <pip> well i just dubbel clicked it :(
[10:54] <MitchM> LjL, I'll just do it one at a time then =)

[10:54] <Doow> hmm.. more questions... if I know what file I'm looking for, is there any way to find out what package it is in? (it's a source-file)
[10:54] <pip> and now its extracting, but i tried both the .r00 and .rar and neither worked
[10:55] <LjL> !apt-file | Doow
[10:55] <ubotu> Doow: apt-file is a program that can tell you which package(s) contain(s) a given filename. To install it and generate the database it needs, run "sudo apt-get install apt-file && sudo apt-file update"
[10:55] <trappist> Doow: sudo apt-get install apt-file;sudo apt-file update; apt-file search filename
[10:55] <BleSS> is there any package for easyeclipse (python)?
[10:55] <pip> now i only have to get that dvd decryption and a played to play .img files :P, but i think ive got some nice guides from LjL :)
[10:55] <Doow> LjL, damn, you're fast =)
[10:55] <LjL> Doow: when i know the answer ;)
[10:55] <Doow> LjL, sofar you've answered almost everything I've asked
[10:56] <Vorbote> shy_: there are *two* different drivers, 8139 and 8139too, try the second one. Two differnt chipsets, same brand model, blame the vendor.
[10:56] <pip> yeah LjL is like a bot :)
[10:56] <pip> what if he is? =o
[10:56] <Vorbote> shy_: s/8139/8139cp/
[10:56] <Chetic> I have uncommented all the stuff in sources.list but I still can't get to the sun-java5-bin package for some reason! It's in the multiverse
[10:56] <LjL> pip: i don't know about what if i am. please try searching on help.ubuntu.com
[10:56] <pip> Chetic: apt-get update
[10:57] <zach634> !LjL
[10:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about LjL - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:57] <shy_> Vorbote: I tried the driver that came with the card and got a compile error.
[10:57] <kmaynard> he needs an entry
[10:57] <shy_> Vorbote: do you know of a binary installer?
[10:57] <kmaynard> and it should include the phrase Italian Stallion
[10:57] <pip> LjL: you are still imba :)
[10:58] <Doow> do all of you regulars here use apt-get instead of synaptic btw? or just that it's easier to write apt-get install rndpkg than: start synaptic, click search...etc
[10:58] <firebird619> I had been using KDE and had kdm set as the default, however, I want to switch back to GNOME/gdm. When I enter sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm it says invoke-rc.d: initscript gdm, action "reload" failed. How can I fix this?
[10:58] <rmjb> hi, I see in my .bash_history it's supposed to set ~/bin in my PATH, and it does so if I log on to a virtual console, but not a gnome-terminal... anyone knows why?
[10:58] <zach634> LjL is a helpful member on the #ubuntu channel on irc.freenode.net.  He is multi-lingual and knows the answers to everything.  Also, Italian Stallion.
[10:58] <Vorbote> shy_: the card has a native dirver. Why would you want to use a vendor supplied (and most probably outdated) dirver?
[10:59] <Vorbote> shy_: s/dirver/driver/ (dislexia attacks again..
[10:59] <kmaynard> lol zach634
[10:59] <pip> Doow: apt-get is imba :)
[10:59] <pip> so L2use it
[10:59] <shy_> Vorbote: that's native as in native to Ubuntu?
[10:59] <Doow> pip, last distro I used was debian stable, so I'm kinda used to it
[10:59] <BHSPitMonkey> hey, all
[10:59] <Vorbote> shy_: As in native in the Linux kernel
[11:00] <Doow> pip, just cirous over these new graphical thingies
[11:00] <Chetic> pip, I did that
[11:00] <Vorbote> shy_: Ubuntu==GNU userspace + Linux kernel
[11:00] <Chetic> I have uncommented all the stuff in sources.list but I still can't get to the sun-java5-bin package for some reason! It's in the multiverse
[11:00] <pip> ah ok, well i like graphical things more too
[11:00] <rmjb> hi, I see in my .bash_history it's supposed to set ~/bin in my PATH, and it does so if I log on to a virtual console, but not a gnome-terminal... anyone knows why?
[11:00] <pip> but i wanna learn 2 use terminal more
[11:00] <kmaynard> Iubotu
[11:00] <kmaynard> crap
[11:00] <kmaynard> !ubotu
[11:00] <zach634> pip: imba? wtf?
[11:00] <shy_> Vorbote: Ok. Please be patient with me. I'm a recent addition to the Linux world.
[11:01] <baxter_kylie> Hi. Does anyone know where/how I can disable screensaver and/or screen blanking?
[11:01] <godstand2> too fast for me
[11:01] <at0m> u could getjava from automatrix
[11:01] <Vorbote> shy_: that's why Ubuntu is called a distribution: All Linuces are Frankenstein monsters.
[11:01] <BHSPitMonkey> I have a problem... I've been trying to install edgy onto my friend's dell PC.  On the LiveCD, it boots up to a certain point (presumably, until when X starts) and then I just get a black screen; Unresponsive. Can't switch TTYs. Can't do ANYTHING.  Now, I installed with the Alternate CD, and it installs fine, but when I boot up the computer... same as with the LiveCD.
[11:01] <asraniel> hi, is there a way in edgy to go back to the open office version of dapper? the one in edgy crashes for me
[11:01] <shy_> Vorbote: Where do I get the driver? Is it pre-installed?
[11:01] <Vorbote> shy_: but coaming back to topic, by default the kernel loads the 8139cp driver, which doesn't work with your card.
[11:01] <LjL> Doow, i use apt-get. but then i also use kubuntu so no synaptic here. and yes, all in all it *is* easier to give commands that explain where to click (also considered that my short-term memory is sorely lacking)
[11:02] <maddoc> Hello. A quick question: after I upgraded from dapper to edgy, my computer does not lock itself when I close the screen. Any guesses on how to fix this?
[11:02] <Allz> hello in ubuntu .do i have to worry about viruses?
[11:02] <asraniel> Allz: no
[11:02] <BHSPitMonkey> I had a "black screen" issue in Dapper, but that was because his video card setup is weird. I could switch to TTY1 and fix the xorg.conf. Not so, anymore.
[11:02] <LjL> Allz: that's your decision. not many viruses in the wild around for linux though
[11:02] <shy_> Vorbote: you got the same card?
[11:02] <rmjb> hi, I see in my .bash_history it's supposed to set ~/bin in my PATH, and it does so if I log on to a virtual console, but not a gnome-terminal... anyone knows why?
[11:02] <Doow> I guess command-line is still going strong, good =)
[11:02] <Allz> ljl so there are viruses for linux to :S?
[11:03] <Doow> Allz, yeah
[11:03] <at0m> no viruses
[11:03] <Vorbote> shy_: Try adding 8139too to /etc/modules and reboot. (That's the easiest fix. The other requires fiddling a bit with modprobe config files. (I've seen a whole bunch of Realtek hardware in me life :-))
[11:03] <at0m> thata are in widl\
[11:03] <at0m> typing sucks form vnc
[11:03] <kmaynard> !factoids
[11:03] <zach634> Allz, yeah, type "sudo rm -rf /" to start up virus protection
[11:03] <Doow> at0m, ok, wouldn't know about that, only know they did some concept ones =)
[11:03] <BlackHawk> gn8
[11:03] <landan> dont do what zach634 said
[11:03] <BHSPitMonkey> !ops : zach634
[11:03] <zach634> :P
[11:04] <Doow> at0m, and of course the thingie where Linus patched the kernel so some virus would work =)
[11:04] <BHSPitMonkey> ok, guess I'm not the master of ubotu syntax.
[11:04] <at0m> they would all require root access anyway which is near impossible unless ur local or something
[11:04] <pip> should i install libdvdcss2 to watch dvds too?
[11:04] <rmjb> hi, I see in my .bash_history it's supposed to set ~/bin in my PATH, and it does so if I log on to a virtual console, but not a gnome-terminal... anyone knows why?
[11:04] <pip> it says something about blocking again :(
[11:04] <zach634> sorry, i read too much bash.org
[11:05] <Allz> xach634 what?
[11:05] <shy_> Vorbote: I downloaded a driver from Realtek that contains a file "8139too.c"  uncompiled C sourcecode. That wouldn't be it though, would it?
[11:05] <specialbuddy> is there a way to set it up so that everytime I plug in my portable hard drive with 3 partitions, the partitions will go to the same media folder everytime?
[11:05] <Allz> why should i trust you :S
[11:05] <zach634> Allz: "rm -rf /" would delete everything on your system
=== d33p__ is now known as luisbg
[11:05] <at0m> ud have to stab a fstab
[11:06] <Vorbote> shy_: that's already included in the kernel. Open a terminal window, type "locate 8139too" and read the output.
[11:06] <Allz> zach634 why do i want that
[11:06] <Allz> ?
[11:06] <Allz> omg :S
[11:06] <Allz> i just did it
[11:06] <zach634> Allz: it's a joke
[11:06] <BHSPitMonkey> zach634, technically it would delete everything you had permission to
[11:06] <BHSPitMonkey> which is your home folder.
[11:06] <Allz> zach634 please tell me what that command did?
[11:06] <InRage`Away> Were can I find ubuntu 7.04
[11:06] <schizoschaf> hi. how would i find out wether my cdrom is broken or misconfigured?
[11:06] <landan> Allz: i told yhou not to
[11:06] <zach634> Allz: i just did?
=== InRage`Away is now known as Hate
[11:07] <Allz> i did the command
[11:07] <Allz> :(
[11:07] <zach634> after we told you what it did..
[11:07] <at0m> schizoschaf: command sudo fdisk -l would show drives
[11:07] <Allz> bi
[11:07] <Allz> no
[11:07] <zach634> did you sudo it?
[11:07] <Allz> yyeah
[11:07] <Allz> :S
[11:07] <Allz> and the password
[11:07] <pip> can VLC play .img files in ubuntu?
[11:07] <shy_> Vorbote: that sounds easy enough.
[11:08] <Doow> btw, gnome does random sounds (sounds like notification for something) any way I can find out what they are about? it's kinda annoying and no program blinks or anything so I don't know what they are all about.
[11:08] <zach634> well now i feel bad
[11:08] <Allz> zach634 i am that much noob .i belive every thing .cause this is a help channel
[11:08] <Allz> :S
[11:08] <BHSPitMonkey> pip, yes... why did you ask that question?
[11:08] <Vorbote> shy_: The easiest fix is to add the module name to /etc/modules and reboot that'll force the kernel to load it.
[11:08] <pip> since i get error messages when im trying
[11:08] <landan> yeah zach634 i suggest leaving you knob
[11:08] <pip> should i install plugins or something to vlc?
[11:08] <zach634> :,(
[11:08] <Allz> zach634 what to do?
[11:08] <firebird619> When I enter sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm it says invoke-rc.d: initscript gdm, action "reload" failed. What can I do to solve this issue?
[11:09] <zach634> Allz: reinstall?
[11:09] <Allz> all the stuff
[11:09] <schizoschaf> at0m it does not mount no more... i guess it happened after burning a dvd.
[11:09] <pip> BHSPitMonkey: wanna tell me which plugins if i need to install any?
[11:09] <zach634> how long had you been using ubuntu before you realized this?
[11:09] <shy_> Vorbote: ok, I'll try that! it really did have me wondering that the card wasn't supported out of the box. this sort of explains it.
[11:09] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, although I really think this is some act, the answer to your question is, install ubuntu again.  Once you restart your computer, ... well, it won't be able to start again. Once you exit IRC, it won't start again. Etc
[11:09] <BHSPitMonkey> you've erased everything except for the contents of the RAM
[11:10] <Hate> anyone know how to install ubuntu(and boot from it) on external usb hdd?
[11:10] <Allz> DEMN you zach dude awwww!!!
[11:10] <zach634> :(
[11:10] <lullabud> Allz:  well, if you just did nuke your system, don't worry.  learning linux is about reinstalling, reinstalling, breaking, reinstalling, etc..
[11:10] <BHSPitMonkey> pip, none that I know; please redirect your pursuit to #VideoLAN, though, as it's much more appropriate (and functional) for answering your questions.
[11:10] <Allz> but i dotn have the disk
[11:10] <Allz> !!
[11:11] <Allz> i dont have the cd
[11:11] <pip> thanks
[11:11] <Allz> that i worked on
[11:11] <Hate> you can
[11:11] <Vorbote> shy_: the internal pci ids are very similar (if not identical). The kernel simply loads the drivers alphabetically...
[11:11] <Hate> order one

[11:12] <Allz> and the cd is long gone
[11:12] <Hate> You can still order one from shipit.
[11:12] <zach634> download it again?
[11:12] <neobonzi> can someone instruct me how to install firmware for my wireless card?
[11:12] <lullabud> Allz:  it would take some serious linux-fu to recover from what you're on if you just nuked your system.
[11:12] <shy_> Vorbote: that definitely explains it. including why the card is so well recognized and only fails when it comes to well working :)
[11:12] <Allz> yeah thanks to zach he is very help ful
[11:12] <The_Machine> what's the easiest way to remotely access my linux machine?
[11:12] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, see if "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" works.
[11:13] <The_Machine> VNC in edgy is broken
[11:13] <lullabud> Allz:  where are you located?  most big cities would have a computer shop that would burn you a disc.
[11:13] <The_Machine> and i need to access my workstation from home tonight
[11:13] <The_Machine> little help?

[11:14] <hamdinp> no  I 'm trying another package
[11:14] <LjL> hamdinp: which?
[11:14] <zach634> if apt-get still works, you could use apt-get install ubuntu-desktop and that should do it for you

[11:17] <tim167> I cant move an item to another menu in Menu Layout tool, how come ?
[11:17] <LjL> hamdinp: you did what?
[11:17] <The_Machine> Hate - i'm trying to get TO my edgy ubuntu box
[11:17] <Allz> nope
[11:17] <Vorbote> shy_: btw, the linux lingo for driver is "kernel module"
[11:17] <BHSPitMonkey> The_Machine, sounds like the weak link is Windows ;)
[11:17] <The_Machine> VNC isn't working inbound
[11:17] <haxality> I have a question about a video driver problem I seem to be having
[11:17] <zach634> what did it say when you tried apt-get?
[11:17] <The_Machine> BHSP - no, it isn't..  it's just VNC..
[11:17] <The_Machine> there's a bug report on it
[11:17] <Allz> it just says the command sudo not ound
[11:17] <Allz> found
[11:17] <The_Machine> but i don't know how to clear it up
[11:17] <shy_> Vorbote: I'm really learning something! :)
[11:17] <LjL> Vorbote: since when?
[11:17] <Hate> Go windows =p
[11:18] <Allz> NO
[11:18] <Allz> never windows
[11:18] <Allz> YEAH!!!
[11:18] <Allz> I JSUT FOUND THE linux cd
[11:18] <The_Machine> in any case, any way i can get into my box without using VNC server (because of the bug?)
[11:18] <Allz> omg thanks you LORD
[11:18] <Allz> :)
[11:18] <BHSPitMonkey> The_Machine, let's see, Edgy + Edgy Works, Edgy + Windows not work... Windows sounds like the weak link!
[11:18] <The_Machine> something that's easy to implement
[11:18] <zach634> phew
[11:18] <The_Machine> BHSPitMonkey: vnc is a protocol.
[11:18] <Allz> ufff i was getting angry at you zach!
[11:18] <The_Machine> it isn't a program.
[11:18] <Hate> run a livecd of edgy :P
[11:18] <zach634> and i was feeling more and more guilty
[11:18] <blue-frog> The_Machine: ssh but u need to have installed the server first, otherwise you're out of your machine...
[11:18] <The_Machine> i should be able to authenticate regardless of what OS i'm using
[11:18] <Hate> ^ and test the theory
[11:19] <The_Machine> (question:  how do i install SSH server?)
[11:19] <Hate> lol
[11:19] <BHSPitMonkey> The_Machine, so I'm mistaken in my experience with VNC working from edgy to edgy?
[11:19] <at0m> the-machine google dapper wiki for the guide on everything.
[11:19] <shy_> Vorbote: and is s/rmmodcp 8139/rmmod 8139cp/ just shorthand or does it actually execute in the console? It doesn't look like a valid Unix command to me.
[11:19] <thevenin> The_Machine: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
[11:19] <Hate> I know all about networking and small things like that, but I can't get my pc to boot from an external hdd... odd.
[11:19] <LjL> The_Machine: "sudo apt-get install openssh-server"
[11:19] <BHSPitMonkey> VNC doesn't use SSH
[11:19] <blue-frog> The_Machine: you need to be in your machine... so dog's biting his its tail...
[11:19] <BHSPitMonkey> if it did, it wouldn't be so insecure
[11:19] <BHSPitMonkey> heh
[11:19] <firebird619> When I enter sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm it says invoke-rc.d: initscript gdm, action "reload" failed. What can I do to solve this issue?
[11:20] <hamdinp> I installed Lale with adding           deb http://www.sonsuzdongu.com/paketler/ ././    row to deb http://www.sonsuzdongu.com/paketler/ ././
[11:20] <The_Machine> Thanks LjL
[11:20] <The_Machine> i'm on my machine now
[11:20] <The_Machine> i won't be on it very soon
[11:20] <Vorbote> shy_: that's for substitution change the first for the second (vi search and replace parlance)
[11:20] <The_Machine> because i'm about to go home
[11:20] <BHSPitMonkey> ././ is redundant
[11:20] <blue-frog> The_Machine: then you're fine
[11:20] <The_Machine> so that's why i'm asking now - so i can get on it later when i get home
[11:20] <zach634> Allz: you all right now? can I stop ironing my hands?
[11:20] <The_Machine> ...no..  i'm..  not..  need to reach machine later when i'm at home..
[11:20] <at0m> is vnc easily brute force cracable?
[11:21] <The_Machine> at0m, not really.
[11:21] <The_Machine> there was a security hole
[11:21] <LjL> hamdinp: that is,  "http://www.sonsuzdongu.com/paketler/ ./"  ?
[11:21] <Allz> zach no i am  not allrighty
[11:21] <The_Machine> but it's been way patched.
[11:21] <BHSPitMonkey> zach634, well, any personal files he may have had are essentially gone ^^
[11:21] <Vorbote> shy_: (in reality, regexp parlance... basic regular expresion stuff :-))
[11:21] <blue-frog> The_Machine: you are as you can install ssh-server now...
[11:21] <Allz> after all work i have done
[11:21] <Allz> to my school work and much more
[11:21] <LjL> hamdinp: is that repository Ubuntu-specific?
[11:21] <zach634> The_Machine: is the machine at home linux or win
[11:21] <Allz> all just gonne
[11:21] <The_Machine> blue-frog - oh, yeah.  I"m doing that now!  :)
[11:21] <darkx> hui
[11:21] <hamdinp> I installed Lale with adding           deb http://www.sonsuzdongu.com/paketler/ ././    row to  /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:21] <The_Machine> zach - i've tried it from both.
[11:21] <Allz> do you think that is allrighty !:@
[11:21] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, it should be possible to recover the data, but not like magic.
[11:21] <darkx> hi.. i'd messup a some settings.. can somone help me
[11:21] <darkx> pls..
[11:21] <darkx> :D
[11:22] <zach634> The_machine: and your ports are forwarded properly?
[11:22] <The_Machine> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79069&highlight=vnc+password <---it's a bug in edgy
[11:22] <The_Machine> yea man
[11:22] <hamdinp> then  search lale and thats it
[11:22] <Allz> bhspitmonkey ?
[11:22] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, he's not free of blame, but you did pull the trigger... all he did was hand you the gun
[11:22] <The_Machine> i get prompted to enter password
[11:22] <LjL> hamdinp: ok, and the problem is? (though - answer my question, is that an ubuntu repository?)
[11:22] <The_Machine> it just doesn't accept it!
[11:22] <lullabud> ubotu tell darkx about ask
[11:22] <The_Machine> it isn't the client!
[11:22] <The_Machine> it's the server.
[11:22] <scip> hoi, does anyone know how to configure the 'mail' program to use a specific smtp server to send mail ?
[11:22] <The_Machine> the password "forgets" itself
[11:22] <The_Machine> i don't know why
[11:22] <The_Machine> heh
[11:22] <Allz> bhspitmonkey yeah but he shouldnt joke around like that
[11:22] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, is your CD the liveCD?
[11:22] <toey> Thanks in advanced to anyone that maybe able to help... I'm having some issues trying to get my on-board sound card (soundblaster live! 24-bit 7.1) running on my ubuntu edgy system. I'm running kernel 2.6.17-10-generic (x86_64) and alsa 1.0.12rc1. An lspci recognises my card as a Creative Labs SB Audigy LS (which is correct as per alsa doco) and it seems the correct kernel modules are running (snd_ca0106). I have done a heap of forum searching
[11:22] <toey>  and searching and tried 3 other live distro's  to no avail. And yes i have done the usual tweaking of alsamixer at the command line interface :) The i do play music through what ever application it seems as though i should be hearing some but noting comes out.
[11:22] <Allz> that is so a shame
[11:22] <hamdinp> LjL
[11:22] <blue-frog> The_Machine: the pc is behind a company firewall? if yes port 22 might be disabled so no connection..
[11:22] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, I tried to summon ops to get him kicked when he said it; I'm aware it was wrong
[11:22] <Allz> bhspitmonkey yeah i have the cd
[11:23] <darkx> i'd reconfigured xhost or x11 system and my sound dosen't work anymore :(
[11:23] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, but it's the LiveCD? That was my question.
[11:23] <The_Machine> installing ssh now.
[11:23] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, as in, when you boot it do you get a desktop, or a console
[11:23] <Zaehlas> OK, using etherial (Wireshark), very, very awesome program, but I don't think it's getting me the information I need.  Both netwrok interfaces are working great, but firestarter errors when setting up the DHCP server, or tries to share the internet connection.  Now, Firestarter help says that for my non-local connection, I should set that device to DHCP and leave it alone, but I'm on a static IP, I can't set it to DHCP.  is that causing p
[11:23] <LjL> Allz, BHSPitMonkey, what happened?
[11:23] <Allz> bhspitmonkey i have the cd that i installd on my computer with first
[11:23] <hamdinp> When I double click the  p7zip-full_4.43~dfsg.1-1_i386.deb
[11:23] <hamdinp> Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6
[11:24] <BHSPitMonkey> LjL, right after you left, zach634 suggested that Allz do "rm -rf /", which he did using sudo.
[11:24] <Allz> bhspitmonkey i have not tryied to boot up
[11:24] <zach634> i may have accidentally told Allz "sudo rm -rf /"
[11:24] <The_Machine> blue-frog: ssh wasn't the problem.  it is VNC..
[11:24] <BHSPitMonkey> LjL, he's still on IRC via his ram.
[11:24] <The_Machine> i just didn't have ssh installed.  i wanted the GUI though..
[11:24] <The_Machine> ssh itself isn't good enough :)
[11:24] <The_Machine> heh
[11:24] <zach634> i was just joking around!
[11:24] <lullabud> LjL:  he's gotten quite a bit of flack for it already though...
[11:24] <LjL> hamdinp: yes, because THAT IS NOT an Ubuntu package. use the official Ubuntu package. just type "sudo apt-get install p7zip-full" after enabling Universe
[11:24] <darkx> pls can somone help me realy short with a very little problem!
[11:24] <zach634> i meant no harm!
[11:24] <LjL> hamdinp: and this is the foruth time i tell you
[11:24] <The_Machine> cause once i'm in i need to be doing some other Term Serv stuff, etc.
[11:25] <The_Machine> (with 1000 users in a channel, it's kind of hard to keep the conversation straight...)
[11:25] <Allz> bhspitmonkey do you think i can cover all the stuff by reinstalling ubuntu
[11:25] <The_Machine> heh, ubuntu has joined.
[11:25] <Allz> :z
[11:25] <BHSPitMonkey> zach634, usually something like that will earn you a (temporary?) ban... it might still, who knows.
[11:25] <BHSPitMonkey> be prepared; you DO deserve it
[11:25] <zach634> i probably deserve it
[11:25] <BHSPitMonkey> they should really G-line the nick 'ubuntu'.
[11:26] <at0m> ud think it would be registered
[11:26] <BHSPitMonkey> surely it is.
[11:26] <Itcharlie> hi all
[11:26] <BHSPitMonkey> ubuntu: " Registered: 1 year 3 weeks 6 days (17h 13m 48s) ago"
[11:26] <at0m> hi!
[11:26] <Itcharlie> question what is oem all about
[11:26] <darkx> can someone tell me how what comand i used to mess up my sound pls.. i just need the name..
[11:26] <darkx> pls...
[11:26] <LjL> zach634, i think you saw what your "joke" resulted in. it goes by itself that if i see anything like this again, it's a ban.
[11:26] <zach634> :(
[11:26] <Discerer> how can I make my wlan0 try to update IP?
[11:27] <neobonzi> can someone help me with some driver troubles?
[11:27] <at0m> ifconfig ?
[11:27] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, you DON'T want to re-install right away. Boot your system up to the LiveCD, and then get back onto IRC, okay? You can install programs while you're booted to the CD. (It's just a tad slower ;)
[11:27] <zach634> think Allz can run apt-get off the liveCD to get ubuntu-desktop back?
[11:28] <ompaul> BHSPitMonkey, it is the nick of anyone on the live cd ...
[11:28] <toey> anyone?
[11:28] <BHSPitMonkey> ompaul, that's a defect. and plus, who cares?
[11:28] <Zaehlas> Any suggestions on why when I have two functional network interfaces, with no communication problems with either, that Firestarter gives me "unknown error" and won't share internet connection, or start the DHCP service?
[11:28] <neobonzi> Can anyone help me find out why ubuntu wont recognize my wireless card as installed?
[11:28] <Allz> ljl i asked what this command do ? and zach634 sayid it will remove all the stuff on your computer and after typing this .he says it's a joke ,.!so i though he was joking about this command would remove my programs!!
[11:28] <Allz> :(
[11:28] <at0m> u can sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[11:28] <ompaul> BHSPitMonkey, well if you think it is a defect then I suggest you report it as a bug
[11:28] <Frem> I'm having trouble with Java. All my programs for this course I'm taking ran fine when I ran them from a Windows IDE, but they throw errors when I try to use them in Linux.
[11:28] <thevenin> Zaehlas: are both cables plugged into the same router/hub
[11:29] <Zaehlas> No, one is to external connectrion, one is to internal modem
[11:29] <zach634> so you ran it after I said it would delete all your stuff?
[11:29] <thevenin> oh ok
[11:29] <Itcharlie> hi
[11:29] <Itcharlie> What is OEM installation all about
[11:29] <neobonzi> Can anyone help me find out why ubuntu wont recognize my wireless card as installed?
[11:29] <BHSPitMonkey> ompaul, if I was to report any bugs, they would be the serious ones that are damaging my hardware every night... I just can't get any specific data about them...
[11:30] <LjL> Discerer: perhaps "dhclient wlan0"
[11:30] <Belboz99> hey all, I'm having some issues compiling a custom kernel.  The first error is:
[11:30] <Belboz99> scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/dialog.h:31:20: error: curses.h: No such file or directory
[11:30] <Belboz99> Any ideas?
[11:30] <scip> Frem: java is often only cross platform if the designer has made them cross-platform.
[11:30] <zntneo> neobonzi: what card is it?
[11:30] <Allz> so zach634 i forgive you :)
[11:30] <Discerer> thanks LjL
[11:30] <LjL> Allz, what did you lose in the end?
[11:30] <Doow> Frem, what errors?
[11:30] <LjL> Allz: if you lost important files, you should probably shut down your machine right now, before the data is overwritten
[11:30] <zach634> thank you allz
[11:30] <zntneo> Was anyone in here when i was complaning about my card not working?
[11:30] <Zaehlas> I have verified that I get DHCP request packets on my internal network, from all devices attached, but no response, as Firestarter is erroring
[11:30] <Frem> scip: I'm doing really, really basic stuff.
[11:30] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, do what I said with the Live CD>
[11:30] <neobonzi> zntneo, its a 3945 ABG
[11:30] <Zaehlas> thevenin: and sorry, I should be saying who I'm responding to, hehe
[11:30] <Frem> Doow: I've got it here http://pastebin.com/825292
[11:30] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, and report back here
[11:30] <thevenin> lol it is ok
[11:30] <zntneo> are you using ndiswrapper
[11:30] <Allz> ljl i have lost every thing that i wanted to keep :S
[11:30] <shy_> Vorbote: So, basically, you've told me three different ways to solve the problem: 1. adding 8139too to /etc/modules and reboot. 2. doing "sudo rmmodcp 8139 && sudo modprobe 8139too". and 3. doing "s/rmmodcp 8139/rmmod 8139cp/"?
[11:31] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, you won't lose it if you do as we tell you to now.
[11:31] <zntneo> LjL: my wireless is working !
[11:31] <LjL> Allz: well it must be said that you should never blindly type commands without knowing what they do. "man <command>" gives you a page of information about any command - use that
[11:31] <Allz> bhspitmonkey first of all what is a live cd?
[11:31] <neobonzi> zntneo, im not using ndiswrapper, im using the linux driver
[11:31] <Allz> is live cd the cd i used to install ubuntu?
[11:31] <thevenin> Zaehlas: i dont really know what to tell you never experienced firestarter first hand, sorry
[11:31] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, it's the ubuntu cd you (probably?) have.
[11:31] <LjL> Allz: the Ubuntu Desktop CD is a "live" CD. boot from that
[11:31] <zntneo> neobonzi: what does it do?
[11:31] <thevenin> maybe just check all of you setting in the firestarter conf
[11:31] <Frem> Doow: All the lines mention ClassLoader multiple times... is some path broken or something?
[11:31] <LjL> Allz: unless you used the Alternate CD, yes
[11:31] <Allz> should i boot
[11:31] <Allz> ?
[11:31] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, when you boot the CD, and you see an ubuntu desktop... that's all the liveCD.
[11:31] <Allz> reboot
[11:31] <Allz> ?
[11:31] <zntneo> Do you have an ip address?
[11:31] <neobonzi> zntneo what does what do?
[11:31] <shy_> Vorbote: Sorry, tomorrow when I'll be trying to execute what you've told me, I won't have an internet connection around to ask you again  :)
[11:31] <LjL> Allz: yes, reboot into the live CD
[11:32] <Vorbote> shy_: only two and they are complementary
[11:32] <BHSPitMonkey> Allz, boot to the CD, and then get on CD. do not install ubuntu, yet.
[11:32] <Allz> ok
[11:32] <Allz> cya then
[11:32] <BHSPitMonkey> uhh
[11:32] <BHSPitMonkey> I meant IRC
[11:32] <Allz> k
[11:32] <Zaehlas> thevenin: no worries, someone will happen along soon enough, and I'll find out what's wrong.   Maybe I never installed the DHCP service properly?   or do I need to start it separately?
[11:32] <Allz> i will be at another computer
[11:32] <Doow> Frem, I don't really know, looking atm (I'm no java guru though, so don't get your hopes up =(
[11:32] <zach634> Good luck allz!
[11:32] <BHSPitMonkey> ah, k then
[11:32] <zntneo> woops sorry how is it not working is it getting an ip address? Are you able to connect to an AP?
[11:32] <Vorbote> shy_: be advised that the commmand as I wrote it first is wrong (that's why I added the substitution bit).
[11:32] <zach634> i feel like such an ass
[11:32] <thevenin> you may need to start it seperatley, not 100% on that
[11:33] <neobonzi> zntneo, no i installed the driver for it but when i check if its running it says my wireless card doesnt exist
[11:33] <Frem> Doow: ok, thanks. One possability is that Java is yet another thing that got messed up when I upgraded to Eft, but things like limewirk work fine, so i dunno.
[11:33] <LjL> zach634, well, you just learned that people *can* take things literally.
[11:33] <Vorbote> shy_: Sooo... To fix the problem permanently, edit /etc/modules and add 8139too to the list.
[11:33] <cmatheson> my swap isn't enabled anymore for some reason.. if i type 'swapon -a' i get the error: "swapon: /dev/disk/by-uuid/c9631828-2a4a-4eac-af74-ce9773864713: Invalid argument'  why is that?
[11:34] <truk77> okay,  so when I tried to install the ubuntu liveCD (6.10) onto my Inspiron 1501, it couldn't find the hard disk to partition.  Am I lacking some kind of SATA support?
[11:34] <firebird619> When I enter sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm it says invoke-rc.d: initscript gdm, action "reload" failed. Can anyone help me?
[11:34] <Vorbote> shy_: To enable the correct module in the running kernel, use "sudo rmmod 8139cp && modprobe 8139too"
[11:34] <UKMatt> are there any widget equivalents to OSX's?  Like... not gdesklets but something that you can bring up and hide
[11:34] <shy_> Vorbote: ah, so /etc/modules is a file. and what I have to do is add the path to 8139too, which I located.
[11:35] <Doow> frem, google gave me this: "The class you are trying to load has been compiled for JDK 1.4 while you are running an older VM"
=== quuxo is now known as quux
[11:35] <Vorbote> shy_: only the name. That's used by the kernel to determine modules to force-load at boot time
[11:35] <Doow> Frem, did you compile it under linux, or just tried to load the .class files that you compiled under windows?
[11:35] <shy_> Vorbote: ok. I'll go for the permanent fix right away and skip the runtime addition.
[11:35] <UKMatt> doow, it shouldnt matter where you compile
[11:35] <Frem> Doow: Well, I ran javac on it, but the old class was still in the directory
[11:36] <Subhuman> hi, has anyone noticed that edgy has issues with GTK 1 apps and custom themes?
[11:36] <Doow> UKMatt, it could matter if it's different versions of java
[11:36] <Frem> Doow: I just deleted it and recompiled, but same errors.
[11:36] <Doow> frem ok
[11:36] <UKMatt> doow, I don't think it would, once its a .class it wouldn't matter
[11:37] <shy_> Vorbote: Thanks a lot, for the help (and the patience)! Tomorrow I'll take a transcript of this chat and I'm confident I'll get it working. A big Thanks!
[11:37] <mcquaid> anyone using beryl but not actually getting the window borders on applications?
[11:37] <mcquaid> I think I read about this in the forums but can't find it now
[11:38] <Vorbote> shy_: good luck!!!!
[11:38] <pip> so ive done everything to play dvds now i think and it wont work with totem, it said it doesnt recognice .img files

[11:40] <LjL> hamdinp: there is also source-o-matic at http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[11:41] <LjL> hamdinp: the short answer is, you enable universe by adding "universe" after "main" and "restricted" in your /etc/apt/sources.list (on the "edgy", "edgy-updates" and "edgy-security" lines). but you better read the guide
[11:41] <Zambezi> Isn't there a textbased FTP-client with support for SSL?
[11:41] <tuxtheslacker> anyone?
[11:41] <weepy> hi - what might the 'login manager' be ?
[11:41] <keescook> Zambezi: lftp works pretty well for SSL
[11:41] <Doow> Frem, weird, everything I find seems to indicate that it's a problem with the files being built for a later version than the JVM is, but since you compiled it with the same system that you try to run it that seems weird
[11:41] <LjL> weepy: perhaps it means the Display Manager - GDM on Ubuntu
[11:42] <zntneo> ok question how do i get network-manager to work on ubuntu after installing it?
[11:42] <zntneo> or is there a wiki
[11:42] <weepy> thanks LjL - where would i find that?
[11:42] <LjL> weepy: dpkg -L gdm
[11:42] <Discerer> whats the problem with it zntneo?
[11:42] <LjL> weepy: what is the problem anyway?
[11:42] <tuxtheslacker> anyone know of some video chatting software aside from ekiga?
[11:42] <zntneo> Its not coming up
[11:42] <Discerer> nothing happening at all? error messages?
[11:42] <weepy> LjL - im following the instructions for installing ATI beryl
[11:42] <zntneo> nevermind i geuss it is
[11:42] <Discerer> try calling it with sudo network-manager
[11:43] <zntneo> but its not seeing my wireless card
[11:43] <weepy> is was stuck on the line 'In the login manager you can now choose a session named Xgl '
[11:43] <Zambezi> keescook, Are you sure? Have you used yourself?
[11:43] <ithicine> tuxtheslacker: aMSN has some webcam support for MSN chatting
[11:43] <Khaled> Hey all just upgraded to edgy, had a bit of issue with xorg it would seem, with a little help from the ubuntu forums peeps (from recovery mode, I put this command in: dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg). Problem is now whenever I scroll in any programme I get this really funny thing happening with sections repeating and scrolling not working, anyone experience the same problem?
[11:43] <Frem> Doow: maybe I have an older java VM installed then the JDK?
[11:43] <keescook> Zambezi: a while back, yeah
[11:43] <tuxtheslacker> ithicine, thanks
[11:43] <Doow> frem could be
[11:43] <Zambezi> keescook, Do I need some more packages to have support for SSL?
[11:43] <LjL> weepy: yes i think it means the display manager. at your login screen, look at the "Options" button on the bottom left
[11:44] <weepy> aah thanks!! ill give it a go
[11:44] <zntneo> any clue how to get network manager to see my wiresless card?
[11:45] <Doow> Frem,  1.4.2 seems to be the default VM
[11:45] <e319> does ubuntu use the newest kernel version? i am having issues with my sata/mobo support :/
[11:45] <Doow> Frem, java --version =)
[11:46] <LjL> e319: no it doesn't
[11:46] <Frem> Doow: That's what I've got installed.
[11:46] <Doow> Frem, hmm.. really no idea then =(
[11:46] <Frem> oooooh
[11:46] <Frem> javac is at 1.5, somehow
[11:46] <keescook> Zambezi: I'm not sure.  :(  do you need SSL or TLS?  TLS used to get autonegotiated for me when I used lftp
[11:46] <Doow> Frem, haha
[11:46] <zach634> yay! Allz has survived!
[11:46] <Frem> thanks, Doow  :-)
[11:47] <e319> LjL: is is possible to get an iso of ubuntu with the newest kernel?
[11:47] <Doow> Frem, np =)
[11:47] <LjL> e319: no
[11:47] <Allz> hello i am on windows now .i remeber i used kubuntu cd to install ubuntu :S
[11:47] <zntneo> so no one knows how to make network-manager see my wireless card?
[11:47] <Zaehlas> OK, played around, and I think I've fixed my problem.  Anyway, if anyone else is going to use Firestarter and share out an internet connection, using DHCP, make sure to install the DHCP version 3 package, not the base version.  Gah, I wish that was in the Firestarter help files.
[11:47] <Allz> does it make difrence?
[11:47] <Allz> kubuntu or ubuntu
[11:47] <zach634> Allz that will still work
[11:47] <e319> LjL: how would i go about learning to insert the newest up to data kernel into my iso?
[11:47] <LjL> Allz, no, just boot from it
[11:47] <Allz> okei just boot from it then what?
[11:48] <zach634> if you want to switch to ubuntu, you cau do apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, or kubuntu-desktop
[11:48] <LjL> e319: i'd give you a pointer if the bot weren't acting up
[11:48] <LjL> e319: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[11:48] <GigaClon> can anyone help me with firefox, it keeps jumping to the top of the page when i select a hyperlink
[11:48] <Belboz99> hey, just to clarify, if I want 64-bit support in my kernel I should select the "Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8" processor family in make menuconfig?
[11:48] <LjL> i doubt you can easily put your kernel *into an ISO* though e319
[11:48] <cafuego> No
[11:48] <Zambezi> keescook, I don't even know the difference. I just want the best.
[11:48] <Belboz99> I have a Core 2 Duo btw
[11:48] <cafuego> You need to build a kernel on an already-64bit system with a 64bit compiler.
[11:49] <LjL> Allz: then we see what can be rescued
[11:49] <bimberi> e319: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[11:49] <e319> LjL: so best method of getting ubuntu to install on newer unsupported (in the current kernel build issued with ubuntu) hardware?
[11:49] <bimberi> LjL: what's the url for ubotu factoids?
[11:49] <GigaClon> !factoids
[11:49] <cafuego> !chickengiblets
[11:49] <GigaClon> !factoid
[11:49] <LjL> stop playing
[11:49] <_EvGen_B> Hi all!!!
[11:50] <tuxtheslacker> hey, in amsn, how do I see my webcam to test if it's working?
[11:50] <cafuego> did he die again?
[11:50] <bimberi> yep, hence my Q
[11:50] <LjL> http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi bimberi
[11:50] <Doow> ubotu isn't replying to my whispers, I think he's in hangupmode or something
[11:50] <bimberi> LjL: cheers :)
[11:50] <cafuego> LjL: trying to make it spit outs its url :-P
[11:50] <lightup> what do I do if package installer tells me a dependency is not satisfiable?  I can't find the library in Synaptic.
[11:50] <tuxtheslacker> ithicine, are you there? if so, can you tell me how to check if amsn accepts my webcam?
[11:50] <ithicine> tuxtheslacker: sort of here... busy atm
[11:50] <_EvGen_B> Who speks russian?
[11:50] <ithicine> one sec
[11:51] <e319> so any ideas how to get ubuntu to support my newer hardware?
[11:51] <tuxtheslacker> ithicine, when you get back, how can I tell if my webcam is working with AMSN?
[11:51] <LjL> !ru | _EvGen_B
[11:51] <LjL> *sigh*
[11:51] <LjL> it comes automatic. _EvGen_B, there is #ubuntu-ru
[11:51] <cafuego> <eh-heh>
[11:51] <Doow> who runs ubotu anyway?
[11:52] <bimberi> habits hard to break ;)
[11:52] <bimberi> Doow: Seveas
[11:52] <_EvGen_B> LjL: thanks
[11:52] <LjL> _EvGen_B, by the way, could you do me a favor and type this in cyrillic characters please? "Pozhalujsta vojdite v #ubuntu-ru dlq pomoshchi na russkom qzyke."
[11:52] <slavi1> LjL: my russian is not good enough for you?
[11:52] <ithicine> tuxtheslacker: your webcam just needs to be supported by v4l, I believe... video4linux.  Do you already have your camera set up?
[11:53] <slavi1>  
[11:53] <LjL> this is a test?
[11:53] <slavi1> :D
[11:53] <tuxtheslacker> ithicine, yep how do  Icheck it though?
[11:53] <LjL> well i don't care who does it, i've just been trying to get that factoid in cyrillic chars for like 2 months, unsuccesfully :P
[11:54] <srf21c> Hey anyone here know how to set the wallpaper in xubuntu xfce from the command line?
[11:54] <srf21c> I'm trying to get www.webilder.org running on a xubuntu 6.06 box, and there's no program option for setting xfce wallpaper.  But there is an option to run a command that sets the wallpaper.
[11:54] <ithicine> hrm... checking it, I don't quite remember.  I'm not in Linux as the moment as I'm playing EVE Online.  I think there's a configuration thing *somewhere*, but it's been ages since I used it
[11:55] <e319> LjL: any ideas?
[11:55] <ithicine> just a min, I'll be able to take a look around online in a minute
[11:55] <slavi1> LjL: how did you translate that though?
[11:55] <LjL> e319, except for the URL i gave you, no...
[11:55] <majestyelias> hello.i just installed xmms and i cant read what it says when i left click for the menu.any suggestions to fix it?
[11:56] <LjL> slavi1, i didn't. i just guessed, i don't know what "eto" means, but it sounds like a form of the verb to be, and "test" wasn't very hard to... guess :)
[11:56] <mikul> anyone who knows how to start mplayer with my second soundcard instead of my default soundcard?
[11:56] <w30> srf21c, try man xset
[11:56] <Allz> ljl so i get a menu when i boot from the cd .what to do ?
[11:56] <LjL> Allz: first option, "start or install"
[11:56] <Allz> aha
[11:57] <Allz> should i klikk on start or insttal?
[11:57] <Allz> install
[11:57] <LjL> click? no, you don't even have a mouse pointer i think
[11:57] <LjL> just hit whatever key it is - Enter, or F1, or whatever it is
[11:57] <ithicine> tuxtheslacker: I think you just might have to get a contact on your MSN list to accept video
[11:57] <slavi1> LjL: nice
[11:57] <e319> ok sowhat nix distro has the mosat up to date kernel then?
[11:57] <slavi1> LjL:    :D
[11:58] <slavi1> guess that :D
[11:58] <numist> :o
[11:58] <Allz> i cant use up and down arrows ljl
[11:58] <|thunder> how can ubuntu upgrade a package thats running ?
[11:58] <srf21c> thanks w30!
[11:58] <ithicine> tuxtheslacker: if they see you, great... and if not, there's more troubleshooting to be done
[11:58] <|thunder> mikul; look in "man mplayer"
[11:58] <zach634> Allz: is this ubuntu or kubuntu?
[11:59] <Flannel> |thunder: which package?
[11:59] <Limulf>  I want Ubuntu (6.10) to start without opening any windows from its previous use, so I have: 1)checked save session changes automatically in the session manager window; 2)closed all windows; 3)restarted Ubuntu; 4)unchecked the save session changes automatically option. My problem is that after restarting again two windows appear, and I don't know how to prevent it: the session manager and a Nautilus window showing my home directory.
[11:59] <Limulf> I have tried to remove the gnome-session-properties from the current session tab in the session manager window,  but after closing and opening again the session manager, the gnome-session-properties program is again there. This is hardly an annoyance, but I would like to know the solution anyway. Thanks for your time and work.
[11:59] <Antrixx_> |thunder: A running program is copied to memory and so the actual executable binary can be replaced safely as it is not in use. Generally.
[11:59] <dcordes> thunder: just close the process and upgrade. where is the point?
[11:59] <ithicine> tuxtheslacker: after finishing this mission in EVE, I can quit that and help out a touch more if needed.  Burning an Edgy disc then :)
[11:59] <mikul> |thunder, its quite big u know :S
[11:59] <|thunder> sweert
[11:59] <|thunder> was just curious
[11:59] <superkirbyartist> Hello.  How do you permanently set the keyboard to canadian french?
[11:59] <pip> LjL: i LOVE you :D
[12:00] <|thunder> i upgrade beryl all the time, just curious how it happens while its running
[12:00] <Flannel> |thunder: the upgrades won't happen until that particular program is restarted, although some programs can do an upgrade without shutting down
[12:00] <rickympl> hi everyone
[12:00] <GigaClon> can anyone help me with firefox, it keeps jumping to the top of the page when i select a hyperlink
[12:00] <|thunder> Flannel; ya, thanks, I always restart after the upgrade, rather than shut it down prior
[12:01] <sjbrown> GigaClon, what page?
